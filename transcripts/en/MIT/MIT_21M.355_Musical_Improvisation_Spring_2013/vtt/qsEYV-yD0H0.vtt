00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:25.910
HARVEY: We have today some
distinguished visitors,

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:29.344
Tim Ray on piano and Eugene
Friesen on his cello.

00:00:29.344 --> 00:00:30.760
And they along
with another person

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:34.528
named Greg Hopkins form a
trio called Tre Corda, named

00:00:34.528 --> 00:00:36.384
for one of the
pedals on the piano.

00:00:36.384 --> 00:00:38.240
Tim Ray will explain it.

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:41.230
And as you know, they are
giving a concert this evening.

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:45.126
So you will all be
coming to that concert,

00:00:45.126 --> 00:00:47.356
and I'll give you as I have
before the concert points

00:00:47.356 --> 00:00:50.932
to write your concert
reflections from.

00:00:50.932 --> 00:00:52.836
I'll send that out
later this afternoon.

00:00:52.836 --> 00:00:55.216
That's at Killian
tonight 8 o'clock.

00:00:55.216 --> 00:00:57.117
So you'll see the full group.

00:00:57.117 --> 00:00:58.450
But they're here this afternoon.

00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:01.796
So please give them
a warm welcome.

00:01:01.796 --> 00:01:02.700
FRIESEN: Thank you.

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:03.160
HARVEY: Thanks.

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:03.560
RAY: Thank you.

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:04.060
Thanks.

00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:09.294
So we're really glad to
be here, and as Mark said,

00:01:09.294 --> 00:01:10.710
we're playing the
concert tonight.

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:12.418
So of course that's
the first requirement

00:01:12.418 --> 00:01:16.030
for passing the class is
that you have to come.

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:17.877
We always make that joke.

00:01:17.877 --> 00:01:18.460
Nobody laughs.

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:19.520
HARVEY: It's not a joke.

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:20.420
RAY: It's not a joke.

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:22.140
Oh that's why they don't laugh.

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:22.740
OK.

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:23.610
Now I get it.

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:24.860
HARVEY: I'm very serious here.

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:26.990
RAY: OK yeah.

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:29.695
In just a little bit, we
want to get into playing

00:01:29.695 --> 00:01:34.420
and of course get you guys
playing as well, hopefully.

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:38.010
Just a little bit about
what we do as a trio.

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:41.240
As Mark said, our trumpet
player Greg Hopkins

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:42.170
will join us tonight.

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:47.690
And then you'll see Greg next
week in the class as well.

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:49.140
We are a trio.

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:51.630
We've been together--
gosh, I guess

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:55.290
it's getting to be about 12
years now, the three of us.

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:58.520
And we do, it's an
unusual instrumentation.

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:03.930
I mean at least unusual in
terms of traditional jazz trios

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:05.380
because there's no base.

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:06.650
There's no drums.

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:09.520
It's also unusual in
a classical setting.

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:12.630
Usually a piano trio with
cello usually has a violin

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:13.330
not trumpet.

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:19.427
So we're a little bit of a
hybrid kind of formation.

00:02:19.427 --> 00:02:21.510
And it's something I had
the idea to put together,

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:23.060
like I said, about 12 years ago.

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:27.070
And a lot of what we
do is we play music

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:29.490
that we compose,
Eugene and myself

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:32.030
and Greg all write
for this group.

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:33.260
We're all improvisers.

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:37.150
So of course improvisation plays
a large part in what we do.

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:38.850
But we also delve
into classical music.

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:42.970
We delve into jazz,
Brazilian stuff.

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:45.290
And that's all our
backgrounds as well.

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:48.500
I mean, myself, Eugene, Greg--
we're all classically trained.

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:50.690
Then we're also
jazz players and do

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:54.450
a lot of things outside
of this group as well.

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:58.340
So besides that,
Eugene and I actually

00:02:58.340 --> 00:02:59.782
have to a duo that we do.

00:02:59.782 --> 00:03:02.240
We're going to actually play
a couple of songs from our duo

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:04.920
repertoire because it's a
little hard to do the trio

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:07.170
stuff without the third person.

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:09.850
Although we might mess around
a little bit later with that,

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:11.690
get you guys involved.

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:15.307
But anything you want to say?

00:03:15.307 --> 00:03:15.890
FRIESEN: Sure.

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:18.030
I mean Mark just told us
the first thing about what

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:20.310
you guys have been
studying so far.

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:22.460
And how many of you
would categorize yourself

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:25.520
as classically
trained musicians?

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:26.270
OK.

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:28.500
Well that was my
background as well.

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:31.880
I was interested in
pop music and rock

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:33.990
really when I was in college.

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:37.290
But I spent most of
my energy in really

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:38.890
practicing classical repertoire.

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:40.830
And it wasn't until I
got out a music school

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:43.840
that I started to get a little
bit more serious about doing

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:47.680
the kind of ear training that
you need for improvising.

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:50.320
And for me it's been
a lifelong process.

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:53.590
I feel like I'm still
learning a lot about that

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:58.600
and learning to recognize chords
and to learn how to contribute

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:02.185
to a harmonic environment
just by listening

00:04:02.185 --> 00:04:04.750
and by pitching in.

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:08.290
And but I've also had a
chance to do a lot of work

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:10.080
with classically
trained musicians who

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:11.380
have never tried before.

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:18.440
Kids of all ages, beginners,
middle school, high school

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:21.550
kids, and even
professionals who are really

00:04:21.550 --> 00:04:23.880
very afraid to improvise.

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:25.410
In fact, last year
I had a chance

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:29.010
to do a presentation at the
American String Teachers

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:31.490
Association on improvising.

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:35.570
And I started this
presentation by asking,

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:38.470
what are some of the things
that keep us classically trained

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:40.520
musicians from improvising?

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:42.700
And there were about 100
people are so in that room,

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:45.370
and everybody had
something to say.

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:48.320
I mean I didn't realize
this could easily

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:50.430
have been the topic of
that whole presentation.

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:54.910
People really inherit,
I think, in our training

00:04:54.910 --> 00:04:57.450
a tremendous amount
of inhibitions.

00:04:57.450 --> 00:04:59.950
Some of it is the
impossibly high standards

00:04:59.950 --> 00:05:03.190
that we are kind of
imbued with as students.

00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:05.420
Some of which, of
course, is really

00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:08.010
good for motivating
our hard work.

00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:10.670
But a lot of which
really makes us kind of

00:05:10.670 --> 00:05:15.510
cower when we're in a situation
where we're encouraged

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:17.520
to be creative
and play something

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:20.040
that we haven't
really rehearsed.

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:27.770
And so that's been kind of
the impetus of my teaching.

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:29.730
And one thing
that's really helped

00:05:29.730 --> 00:05:34.270
me is setting some guidelines
that were comfortable for me

00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:36.370
as a classically trained player.

00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:39.780
So one of the first ways
that I felt I could improvise

00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:44.740
was no wrong notes, completely
open, free improv stuff.

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:46.610
And I understand you
guys get to do that

00:05:46.610 --> 00:05:49.360
each week with Tom Hall, right?

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:52.159
Am I correct in assuming
that at some point

00:05:52.159 --> 00:05:54.200
you do some improvising
where you're not worrying

00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:56.460
about chords or scales
or things like that?

00:05:56.460 --> 00:05:58.610
It's really most about
interaction, right?

00:05:58.610 --> 00:06:01.050
And how it comes together
rhythmically maybe.

00:06:01.050 --> 00:06:03.210
I mean do you work on the
rhythmic side of things

00:06:03.210 --> 00:06:05.520
more that way, or is
it more intuitive kind

00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:07.240
of communicating?

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:09.149
Could someone
answer that for me?

00:06:09.149 --> 00:06:11.690
AUDIENCE: Different things, and
different exercises, I guess.

00:06:11.690 --> 00:06:14.060
FRIESEN: So it's
different all the time,

00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:17.140
different guidelines for your
improv that you're doing there.

00:06:17.140 --> 00:06:18.560
Gotcha.

00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:21.460
Well that was-- the free
improv part of things

00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:24.740
and not worrying about notes is
a tremendous liberator for me

00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:26.730
as a classically trained player.

00:06:26.730 --> 00:06:30.820
And then the next thing
was playing diatonically.

00:06:30.820 --> 00:06:36.840
Learning how to create something
that really had heart, that

00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:40.390
had shape, that had
personal expression for me,

00:06:40.390 --> 00:06:43.860
but that was kind
of limited in terms

00:06:43.860 --> 00:06:46.960
of how it wandered
from key to key.

00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:50.860
And maybe we could play "First
Ride" as an example of that.

00:06:50.860 --> 00:06:51.360
RAY: Sure.

00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:52.250
That's great.

00:06:52.250 --> 00:06:54.541
FRIESEN: I don't know where
Tim wanted to go with this.

00:06:54.541 --> 00:06:56.550
We're just kind of winging this.

00:06:56.550 --> 00:07:00.500
But for me this piece
that we're about to play

00:07:00.500 --> 00:07:04.590
was really one of
the first improvs

00:07:04.590 --> 00:07:07.445
that I did that was a real
successful cello and piano

00:07:07.445 --> 00:07:07.945
improv.

00:07:07.945 --> 00:07:11.050
It happened to be recorded
in a great cathedral

00:07:11.050 --> 00:07:13.160
in New York, Saint
John the Divine.

00:07:13.160 --> 00:07:18.439
And it had such a kind
of formal quality.

00:07:18.439 --> 00:07:20.480
It's something that I
wanted to play in concerts.

00:07:20.480 --> 00:07:22.440
So we transcribed it.

00:07:22.440 --> 00:07:24.800
We went by went back and
listened to the recording

00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:26.780
and really transcribed it.

00:07:26.780 --> 00:07:30.980
It's like when you have
an improv like this,

00:07:30.980 --> 00:07:33.750
it's kind of like capturing
lightning in a bottle in a way.

00:07:33.750 --> 00:07:36.050
And if you want to
duplicate it, you

00:07:36.050 --> 00:07:38.630
can take some of the themes
and stuff as the starting

00:07:38.630 --> 00:07:40.730
off points, but in
this case, it seemed

00:07:40.730 --> 00:07:44.080
to work so well as kind of
a thought through thing,

00:07:44.080 --> 00:07:47.060
that we play it
as close as we can

00:07:47.060 --> 00:07:48.990
to the recording as possible.

00:07:48.990 --> 00:07:51.970
Now the piano part is
pretty much Tim's invention.

00:07:51.970 --> 00:07:53.780
What he had from
the transcription

00:07:53.780 --> 00:07:57.060
were a few right hand
lines that Paul Halley,

00:07:57.060 --> 00:08:00.080
the original
improviser, improvised.

00:08:00.080 --> 00:08:03.430
But the cello part is
really-- it's written.

00:08:03.430 --> 00:08:05.680
It's the same cello part
that I originally improvised.

00:08:05.680 --> 00:08:19.544
So this is called "First Ride."

00:08:19.544 --> 00:08:20.044
RAY: Ready?

00:08:20.044 --> 00:08:22.040
FRIESEN: Yeah.

00:08:22.040 --> 00:08:24.535
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:12:55.736 --> 00:12:56.780
[AUDIENCE APPLAUSE]

00:12:56.780 --> 00:12:57.280
RAY: Thanks.

00:13:01.500 --> 00:13:03.790
and the construction had
the third in that chord.

00:13:03.790 --> 00:13:05.830
I don't know if you
caught that, whatever

00:13:05.830 --> 00:13:09.590
that machine is out there.

00:13:09.590 --> 00:13:14.380
RAY: So I'd love to get
some of your thoughts

00:13:14.380 --> 00:13:15.950
and some of your questions.

00:13:15.950 --> 00:13:21.880
But basically that whole
thing that you heard just now,

00:13:21.880 --> 00:13:26.130
as Eugene said, was all
originally freely improvised,

00:13:26.130 --> 00:13:29.420
but in a diatonic setting
meaning we really never

00:13:29.420 --> 00:13:31.490
left the key of D major, right?

00:13:31.490 --> 00:13:32.934
I mean basically.

00:13:32.934 --> 00:13:35.350
I mean, you see I've got all
these pages of transcription,

00:13:35.350 --> 00:13:38.770
but it's all-- we might
try little exercise where

00:13:38.770 --> 00:13:41.610
we do that with some of you
where diatonic-- we're staying

00:13:41.610 --> 00:13:44.730
in one key, but we're just
moving the chords around,

00:13:44.730 --> 00:13:47.320
moving the roots of these
chords around, doing

00:13:47.320 --> 00:13:49.380
some improvisations,
and then doing

00:13:49.380 --> 00:13:53.940
figures, motives,
melodies based on that.

00:13:53.940 --> 00:13:56.810
Were there any questions,
any observations,

00:13:56.810 --> 00:13:59.720
commentary, criticism?

00:13:59.720 --> 00:14:00.505
Yes,

00:14:00.505 --> 00:14:01.130
HARVEY: Adrian.

00:14:01.130 --> 00:14:01.510
RAY: Adrian.

00:14:01.510 --> 00:14:02.010
Thank you.

00:14:02.010 --> 00:14:04.538
ADRIAN: I was wondering I
guess whether like there

00:14:04.538 --> 00:14:06.274
was some sort of
design framework

00:14:06.274 --> 00:14:09.498
that had been pre-planned,
like even some chord

00:14:09.498 --> 00:14:11.480
progressions that you guys do?

00:14:11.480 --> 00:14:12.282
FRIESEN: Nothing.

00:14:12.282 --> 00:14:13.490
ADRIAN: Everything was just--

00:14:13.490 --> 00:14:14.073
FRIESEN: Yeah.

00:14:16.620 --> 00:14:19.300
RAY: Thanks.

00:14:19.300 --> 00:14:20.976
Cool, yeah.

00:14:20.976 --> 00:14:22.698
AUDIENCE: So the
original theme actually

00:14:22.698 --> 00:14:24.340
reminded me a lot
of Cannon in D.

00:14:24.340 --> 00:14:25.550
RAY: Of Cannon in D?

00:14:25.550 --> 00:14:29.246
AUDIENCE: Yeah,
where you started.

00:14:29.246 --> 00:14:31.158
[INAUDIBLE]

00:14:31.158 --> 00:14:34.182
[PLAYING CELLO]

00:14:34.182 --> 00:14:35.140
FRIESEN: Is the melody.

00:14:38.550 --> 00:14:41.020
AUDIENCE: Yeah, I don't if
it's just because of the title

00:14:41.020 --> 00:14:43.182
or just because
it's [INAUDIBLE].

00:14:43.182 --> 00:14:45.140
RAY: That might of had
something to do with it.

00:14:45.140 --> 00:14:50.020
I mean, I'm sure you probably
know when you're improvising,

00:14:50.020 --> 00:14:52.509
you know you're
all you're always

00:14:52.509 --> 00:14:53.925
drawing from things
that you know.

00:14:53.925 --> 00:14:57.020
Drawing from music that you've
heard, drawing of course,

00:14:57.020 --> 00:15:00.230
from the people around you
who are improvising as well.

00:15:00.230 --> 00:15:02.850
So there's certainly
plenty of times

00:15:02.850 --> 00:15:05.190
when I'm improvising
and I'll play something

00:15:05.190 --> 00:15:08.580
and I'll be like, Oh, I
think that was the theme

00:15:08.580 --> 00:15:12.137
song to some TV show from
the '70s without really

00:15:12.137 --> 00:15:12.720
intentionally.

00:15:12.720 --> 00:15:15.260
I mean obviously jazz
players will intentionally

00:15:15.260 --> 00:15:17.540
throw in little quotes
for humorous effect.

00:15:17.540 --> 00:15:21.599
But oftentimes, they don't
come out intentionally.

00:15:21.599 --> 00:15:22.390
They just come out.

00:15:22.390 --> 00:15:26.230
And that's sometimes
the fun part of it.

00:15:26.230 --> 00:15:28.480
FRIESEN: I've heard it said
that you are what you eat.

00:15:28.480 --> 00:15:32.050
You know that expression?

00:15:32.050 --> 00:15:34.710
Certainly true for
us improvisers.

00:15:34.710 --> 00:15:39.020
What you know and what
you listen to really

00:15:39.020 --> 00:15:41.110
plays a huge part
in what you access

00:15:41.110 --> 00:15:44.095
when you're really
and truly improvising.

00:15:44.095 --> 00:15:46.220
Although there's another
thing that I might mention

00:15:46.220 --> 00:15:51.930
about this particular piece
is that at least for me, there

00:15:51.930 --> 00:15:55.180
was something about the
acoustics of the cathedral that

00:15:55.180 --> 00:15:58.840
really activated my
imagination in a different way

00:15:58.840 --> 00:16:01.560
than it had ever been before.

00:16:01.560 --> 00:16:05.740
The way that the cello
just rose up in the room

00:16:05.740 --> 00:16:11.710
somehow shifted my focus
from me and from my technique

00:16:11.710 --> 00:16:13.220
to the room.

00:16:13.220 --> 00:16:17.420
I mean it was almost like there
was this other kind of presence

00:16:17.420 --> 00:16:19.860
in there that I
was tapping into.

00:16:19.860 --> 00:16:23.890
And it was an important
experience for me.

00:16:23.890 --> 00:16:28.190
And oftentimes when I'm in
an improvisational situation,

00:16:28.190 --> 00:16:30.530
I place myself back
in the cathedral

00:16:30.530 --> 00:16:32.140
because I really
felt like that was

00:16:32.140 --> 00:16:36.500
where my voice as an
improviser was born.

00:16:36.500 --> 00:16:39.470
It was the first time I had
that experience of really being

00:16:39.470 --> 00:16:43.050
the music and not being a cello
player or even being a person.

00:16:47.190 --> 00:16:50.030
RAY: Any other
comments or questions?

00:16:50.030 --> 00:16:52.625
CHRIS: Not really a
question, but after hearing

00:16:52.625 --> 00:16:56.432
that you said that the
[INAUDIBLE] design [INAUDIBLE].

00:16:56.432 --> 00:16:58.707
That was really
inspiring that you

00:16:58.707 --> 00:17:00.705
managed to come up with
something so varied.

00:17:00.705 --> 00:17:02.830
Because I am really interested
in things like that.

00:17:02.830 --> 00:17:05.530
Because I really like the
idea of trying to improvise

00:17:05.530 --> 00:17:07.800
like that.

00:17:07.800 --> 00:17:09.150
Just a simple idea.

00:17:09.150 --> 00:17:11.686
And I guess that's my
favorite way of improvising.

00:17:11.686 --> 00:17:13.938
But I always find
a sense of struggle

00:17:13.938 --> 00:17:17.373
to come up of with a whole
variety of interesting things

00:17:17.373 --> 00:17:19.819
maybe just from that
simple beginning.

00:17:19.819 --> 00:17:21.756
That's really, really
cool that that--

00:17:21.756 --> 00:17:23.880
FRIESEN: Can you hear what
he's saying well enough?

00:17:23.880 --> 00:17:25.500
Yeah.

00:17:25.500 --> 00:17:27.550
I mean maybe one of the
things he's hinting at

00:17:27.550 --> 00:17:30.890
is the power there
is in limitation.

00:17:30.890 --> 00:17:32.990
That when you really
set boundaries

00:17:32.990 --> 00:17:35.580
about what your language
is going to be sometimes

00:17:35.580 --> 00:17:38.220
that can be really liberating.

00:17:38.220 --> 00:17:43.610
And in my case, with my limited
improv skills at that time--

00:17:43.610 --> 00:17:45.820
that was a 1986
when we did that.

00:17:45.820 --> 00:17:49.550
I was really a pretty
new improviser then.

00:17:49.550 --> 00:17:53.670
The fact that we were
in an environment

00:17:53.670 --> 00:17:55.530
where I could use
my open strings,

00:17:55.530 --> 00:17:59.550
my harmonics, you know, I knew
what key we were in, really

00:17:59.550 --> 00:18:01.150
helped me so much.

00:18:01.150 --> 00:18:04.040
There's something about that
that just calmed me down,

00:18:04.040 --> 00:18:07.360
and I think that that calmness
and the incredible acoustics

00:18:07.360 --> 00:18:10.880
of the place helped for
this kind of magical moment

00:18:10.880 --> 00:18:12.300
to happen.

00:18:12.300 --> 00:18:15.860
Because it's a special moment.

00:18:15.860 --> 00:18:18.590
A piece like that
is something that

00:18:18.590 --> 00:18:20.760
really captured our
attention in a special way.

00:18:20.760 --> 00:18:22.620
And that's why we
want to transcribe it.

00:18:22.620 --> 00:18:24.440
That doesn't happen
every time we sit down

00:18:24.440 --> 00:18:26.560
to play something compelling.

00:18:26.560 --> 00:18:28.980
But it is amazing
what can happen

00:18:28.980 --> 00:18:34.050
with kind of a limited
palette of harmony,

00:18:34.050 --> 00:18:37.380
I guess you could say.

00:18:37.380 --> 00:18:41.640
How that can ignite this
kind of passion and feeling

00:18:41.640 --> 00:18:43.910
of warmth and rapture.

00:18:43.910 --> 00:18:45.620
And what are some
other adjectives

00:18:45.620 --> 00:18:46.840
you would use for that music?

00:18:57.818 --> 00:18:58.830
RAY: Cool.

00:18:58.830 --> 00:19:00.190
FRIESEN: No they've got it.

00:19:00.190 --> 00:19:01.220
Some more adjectives.

00:19:01.220 --> 00:19:03.840
How would you describe it?

00:19:03.840 --> 00:19:05.650
Does it sound like
church music or?

00:19:08.821 --> 00:19:09.730
AUDIENCE: Just calm.

00:19:09.730 --> 00:19:11.630
FRIESEN: Calm.

00:19:11.630 --> 00:19:15.030
Maybe that's the
diatomic part of it.

00:19:15.030 --> 00:19:18.137
It's very grounded in that way.

00:19:18.137 --> 00:19:19.091
RAY: Yeah, definitely.

00:19:19.091 --> 00:19:24.650
Yeah, I mean I think the other
thing that-- I'm sorry, Chris.

00:19:24.650 --> 00:19:26.100
Thank you.

00:19:26.100 --> 00:19:29.840
Chris, at least in
my mind was when

00:19:29.840 --> 00:19:33.610
he was talking about sort
of how much can come out

00:19:33.610 --> 00:19:37.290
of a very small amount
of starter material,

00:19:37.290 --> 00:19:39.211
if you want to call it that.

00:19:39.211 --> 00:19:44.310
I think part of that
is also as Eugene said.

00:19:44.310 --> 00:19:46.322
It's sometimes having
the limitations of just,

00:19:46.322 --> 00:19:48.030
we're going to play
in D major, let's see

00:19:48.030 --> 00:19:51.350
what happens, can
trigger these things.

00:19:51.350 --> 00:19:53.570
I think some of the other
thing too is sometimes

00:19:53.570 --> 00:19:57.920
when you're doing essentially
what I would consider freely

00:19:57.920 --> 00:20:02.200
improvising, you're
always trying

00:20:02.200 --> 00:20:03.770
to-- you're always listening.

00:20:03.770 --> 00:20:10.340
You're always trying to think in
a larger form, a larger format.

00:20:10.340 --> 00:20:14.570
You know I mean all the music
that we love has sections.

00:20:14.570 --> 00:20:18.920
All the great
Mozart sonatas they

00:20:18.920 --> 00:20:23.190
have different sections
that are contrasting.

00:20:23.190 --> 00:20:24.510
Same with a great jazz piece.

00:20:24.510 --> 00:20:27.230
They have different sections--
contrasting sections,

00:20:27.230 --> 00:20:30.530
loud parts, soft
parts, a section that

00:20:30.530 --> 00:20:32.970
features a particular soloist,
a section the features

00:20:32.970 --> 00:20:34.330
the ensemble.

00:20:34.330 --> 00:20:37.490
You know, these are
all things we're

00:20:37.490 --> 00:20:42.550
trying to recreate in maybe not
necessarily a conscious way,

00:20:42.550 --> 00:20:46.640
although I mean, you could
be more conscious about it.

00:20:46.640 --> 00:20:48.780
But even when you're
just freely improvising,

00:20:48.780 --> 00:20:51.320
and again, you might be working
on these kinds of things

00:20:51.320 --> 00:20:53.570
already.

00:20:53.570 --> 00:20:56.570
You're always kind of
listening for-- your listening

00:20:56.570 --> 00:20:57.330
as you're playing.

00:20:57.330 --> 00:21:00.230
You're kind of thinking
like, OK maybe it's

00:21:00.230 --> 00:21:02.290
time to come down and
do a quiet section.

00:21:02.290 --> 00:21:04.260
Or maybe this is building
up to a big section.

00:21:04.260 --> 00:21:05.510
Maybe this is the climax.

00:21:05.510 --> 00:21:06.470
Was that the climax?

00:21:06.470 --> 00:21:07.020
I don't know.

00:21:07.020 --> 00:21:08.990
Let's see where it goes.

00:21:08.990 --> 00:21:11.120
But you're always
kind of-- I don't

00:21:11.120 --> 00:21:14.580
want to say that you're
always judging and evaluating,

00:21:14.580 --> 00:21:19.450
but in a certain
way the feelings

00:21:19.450 --> 00:21:23.800
that you develop when you play
a great piece of classical music

00:21:23.800 --> 00:21:26.860
or a great jazz
piece, these feelings

00:21:26.860 --> 00:21:30.110
you're trying to recreate in
a freely improvised setting.

00:21:30.110 --> 00:21:32.830
And often times you
can go back and you

00:21:32.830 --> 00:21:36.500
can look through
what you just did.

00:21:36.500 --> 00:21:38.230
With my students--
Eugene and I both

00:21:38.230 --> 00:21:39.500
teach at the Berklee College.

00:21:39.500 --> 00:21:41.680
A lot of times with
my piano students,

00:21:41.680 --> 00:21:43.110
when we work on
improvisation, I'm

00:21:43.110 --> 00:21:44.870
telling them you have
to record yourself.

00:21:44.870 --> 00:21:48.320
You have to turn on your
phone or whatever you've got,

00:21:48.320 --> 00:21:52.380
something just really easy
that you carry around with you.

00:21:52.380 --> 00:21:54.730
You record your improvisation,
record your group

00:21:54.730 --> 00:21:56.200
improvisations.

00:21:56.200 --> 00:21:58.750
And then listen back and
go, Yeah this is great.

00:21:58.750 --> 00:22:00.200
I didn't like this so much.

00:22:00.200 --> 00:22:02.530
You know because that's
the way you learn.

00:22:02.530 --> 00:22:04.984
That's a great learning tool,
and I think sometimes it's

00:22:04.984 --> 00:22:07.400
one of those obvious things
that people don't think to do.

00:22:07.400 --> 00:22:10.280
When, like I said,
from my perspective,

00:22:10.280 --> 00:22:13.160
it's a really great
way to develop

00:22:13.160 --> 00:22:14.420
a sense of what you're doing.

00:22:17.250 --> 00:22:22.530
So I'd like to
play one more tune.

00:22:22.530 --> 00:22:28.740
And then we'll maybe open it
up a little bit for you guys.

00:22:31.680 --> 00:22:37.163
I'm wondering if we should do
something like the big violins,

00:22:37.163 --> 00:22:39.200
maybe?

00:22:39.200 --> 00:22:40.750
FRIESEN: Like the
blues in E minor?

00:22:40.750 --> 00:22:43.470
RAY: Yeah.

00:22:43.470 --> 00:22:46.040
Do you want to?

00:22:46.040 --> 00:22:47.410
FRIESEN: Yeah.

00:22:47.410 --> 00:22:50.046
Have you guys worked on blues?

00:22:50.046 --> 00:22:51.760
Yeah, I'm sure you have.

00:22:51.760 --> 00:22:54.360
Well again, for me as a
classically trained player,

00:22:54.360 --> 00:22:59.090
the blues were and are
really, really challenging.

00:22:59.090 --> 00:23:00.886
I mean just keeping
the form together,

00:23:00.886 --> 00:23:02.760
I really had to have
the paper in front of me

00:23:02.760 --> 00:23:05.290
for a long, long time just
to keep the twelve bar

00:23:05.290 --> 00:23:07.310
thing together.

00:23:07.310 --> 00:23:11.680
So but eventually it
became internalized.

00:23:11.680 --> 00:23:18.090
And here is a blues
that I came up with.

00:23:18.090 --> 00:23:23.374
I remember watching the shock
and awe invasion of Baghdad.

00:23:23.374 --> 00:23:25.290
I was just sitting in
front of this big screen

00:23:25.290 --> 00:23:27.331
TV with my cello, and what
I found myself playing

00:23:27.331 --> 00:23:33.020
was this one, Ray.

00:23:33.020 --> 00:23:35.515
[PLAYING MUSIC]

00:27:36.232 --> 00:27:38.712
[APPLAUSE]

00:27:44.080 --> 00:27:44.580
RAY: Cool.

00:27:44.580 --> 00:27:50.790
So, I have so much playing
that with you, Eugene.

00:27:50.790 --> 00:27:51.950
That's a gas.

00:27:51.950 --> 00:27:57.250
So obviously blues form, right?

00:27:57.250 --> 00:28:00.620
Were you're able to
keep track of it?

00:28:00.620 --> 00:28:02.020
Mostly you could, right?

00:28:02.020 --> 00:28:08.890
I mean that's one of things,
like I said before, as a jazz

00:28:08.890 --> 00:28:12.190
group we're unusual because
there's no bass and no drums.

00:28:12.190 --> 00:28:14.270
But of course, when
again this is something

00:28:14.270 --> 00:28:15.950
I preach to some
of my own students.

00:28:15.950 --> 00:28:19.270
It's like we're kind of
always the bass player.

00:28:19.270 --> 00:28:20.370
We're always the drummer.

00:28:20.370 --> 00:28:22.750
Even if you're playing a flute,
you're still the drummer,

00:28:22.750 --> 00:28:23.410
right?

00:28:23.410 --> 00:28:26.670
And I think that's one
of the things-- this

00:28:26.670 --> 00:28:30.990
is one of the kinds of
playing that we do as a trio

00:28:30.990 --> 00:28:35.330
where we actually
use those skills.

00:28:35.330 --> 00:28:38.800
We use those like, OK, let's--
we have this internal thing

00:28:38.800 --> 00:28:41.280
going on, this internal
metronome going on.

00:28:41.280 --> 00:28:43.200
We don't need the ride
cymbal necessarily

00:28:43.200 --> 00:28:45.320
because we're
keeping it together.

00:28:45.320 --> 00:28:48.780
And then of course we
because we like to have fun

00:28:48.780 --> 00:28:51.220
will throw caution
to the wind and do

00:28:51.220 --> 00:28:52.490
some crazy stuff for a while.

00:28:52.490 --> 00:28:54.850
But still in the back
of our mind, of course,

00:28:54.850 --> 00:28:56.600
we're listening, too.

00:28:56.600 --> 00:28:59.080
We're keeping
track of that time.

00:29:01.620 --> 00:29:02.790
Any questions about that?

00:29:02.790 --> 00:29:04.705
Comments?

00:29:04.705 --> 00:29:05.330
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:29:05.330 --> 00:29:10.070
I guess, I was wondering just
how-- [INAUDIBLE] on the piano,

00:29:10.070 --> 00:29:12.580
you were like playing really
quick fast notes like that

00:29:12.580 --> 00:29:15.355
[INAUDIBLE] the
cello, you ended,

00:29:15.355 --> 00:29:16.730
you know every
time you did this,

00:29:16.730 --> 00:29:18.240
you both ended at the same time.

00:29:18.240 --> 00:29:20.450
And is it just that
you've played together

00:29:20.450 --> 00:29:21.700
long enough that you sort of--

00:29:21.700 --> 00:29:24.030
FRIESEN: Actually I
think that the moments

00:29:24.030 --> 00:29:26.280
you may be referring to are
the things about the blues

00:29:26.280 --> 00:29:30.330
form, where we would come
to the end of a phrase.

00:29:30.330 --> 00:29:35.390
And as Tim was hinting at,
or articulating before,

00:29:35.390 --> 00:29:38.940
when you feel like something
needs to change-- you know some

00:29:38.940 --> 00:29:41.000
of those double bars in
the music, in this case

00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:43.870
the end of the 12 bar form,
where we are crescendo-ing,

00:29:43.870 --> 00:29:47.060
crescendo-ing getting crazier
and crazier and crazier.

00:29:47.060 --> 00:29:49.820
It just feels like, Oh wouldn't
that be a nice dramatic moment

00:29:49.820 --> 00:29:52.400
to just jump off the
cliff back into the head

00:29:52.400 --> 00:29:55.836
into that real,
real simple thing.

00:29:55.836 --> 00:29:58.899
AUDIENCE: I think two of the
times it happened at the end

00:29:58.899 --> 00:30:00.857
of the 12 bars, I think
one was just at the end

00:30:00.857 --> 00:30:02.269
of a [INAUDIBLE]--

00:30:02.269 --> 00:30:03.810
FRIESEN: And that's
just lucking out.

00:30:07.090 --> 00:30:08.840
And I think that's
probably what keeps

00:30:08.840 --> 00:30:11.050
all of us doing this is
just that lucking out

00:30:11.050 --> 00:30:13.940
part of the thing, just
not really knowing what's

00:30:13.940 --> 00:30:15.200
going to happen.

00:30:15.200 --> 00:30:17.400
And you know, none of
us wants to rehearse

00:30:17.400 --> 00:30:21.660
so much that you can
depend on those things.

00:30:21.660 --> 00:30:23.490
I love the very
expression, there's

00:30:23.490 --> 00:30:27.255
no substitute for a genuine
lack of preparation.

00:30:27.255 --> 00:30:29.880
Have you ever heard
that one before?

00:30:29.880 --> 00:30:31.940
Because sometimes
when you're really

00:30:31.940 --> 00:30:34.530
on the front of
your chair, you know

00:30:34.530 --> 00:30:39.400
you're really listening
in a way that is enhanced.

00:30:39.400 --> 00:30:43.180
And I think that is the
thing that keeps us musicians

00:30:43.180 --> 00:30:48.120
doing this is that incredibly
intense process of listening

00:30:48.120 --> 00:30:53.000
and presence, which by the way
is transmitted to the audience.

00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:55.160
And we get a lot of
energy from the audience.

00:30:55.160 --> 00:30:57.570
You probably know this
already, the value

00:30:57.570 --> 00:31:02.630
of doing this in front of people
is enhanced exponentially.

00:31:02.630 --> 00:31:06.570
And the quality of being in the
audience when you're witnessing

00:31:06.570 --> 00:31:09.080
something that is
happening in real time

00:31:09.080 --> 00:31:10.910
is something tangible.

00:31:10.910 --> 00:31:14.140
Not only that, but as scientific
research has pointed out,

00:31:14.140 --> 00:31:17.180
our brain research,
listeners will

00:31:17.180 --> 00:31:19.920
have a similar kind
of experience brain

00:31:19.920 --> 00:31:22.710
experience as the performers.

00:31:22.710 --> 00:31:25.590
So we really get
this vicarious kind

00:31:25.590 --> 00:31:27.480
of thrill, this
kind of vicarious

00:31:27.480 --> 00:31:30.740
high just from being in
the presence of something

00:31:30.740 --> 00:31:32.870
incredible that's going on.

00:31:32.870 --> 00:31:36.640
Which is why I'm quite sure
that live performance will never

00:31:36.640 --> 00:31:37.140
die.

00:31:37.140 --> 00:31:40.900
You know, once we get over this
infatuation with the screens,

00:31:40.900 --> 00:31:44.530
I think people will
be back at concerts

00:31:44.530 --> 00:31:45.730
and live events like that.

00:31:45.730 --> 00:31:48.040
And certainly the thing that
keeps us musicians at it

00:31:48.040 --> 00:31:52.230
because there again the
enhanced listening that we

00:31:52.230 --> 00:31:55.320
can do in rehearsal is very
different than it feels

00:31:55.320 --> 00:31:57.000
like from playing for you guys.

00:31:57.000 --> 00:31:59.980
You know there's an
extra level of attention

00:31:59.980 --> 00:32:02.340
that comes to it that is--

00:32:02.340 --> 00:32:05.320
And sometimes it's just a tiny
little switch in your brain

00:32:05.320 --> 00:32:07.570
that makes all the
difference in the world.

00:32:07.570 --> 00:32:08.530
It's so amazing.

00:32:08.530 --> 00:32:11.190
You probably know this from
the musical work you've done

00:32:11.190 --> 00:32:12.520
or the writing you've done.

00:32:12.520 --> 00:32:15.340
Sometimes you'll sit
down and you'll just,

00:32:15.340 --> 00:32:19.090
your body will just type
something really cool.

00:32:19.090 --> 00:32:23.200
And you didn't even mean to do
it, it just kind of happened.

00:32:23.200 --> 00:32:26.194
You can't force
that kind of thing.

00:32:26.194 --> 00:32:26.860
RAY: Absolutely.

00:32:26.860 --> 00:32:30.500
FRIESEN: Well, where should
we go from here, Tim?

00:32:30.500 --> 00:32:35.740
RAY: So I wanted to
do this actually.

00:32:35.740 --> 00:32:38.650
I wanted to hand out--
because I know some of you

00:32:38.650 --> 00:32:41.120
have to leave early.

00:32:41.120 --> 00:32:44.930
So my thinking for this
course-- you know, it is school.

00:32:44.930 --> 00:32:47.670
You do have to
have an assignment.

00:32:47.670 --> 00:32:51.620
So I'm going to hand
out a tune, and I

00:32:51.620 --> 00:32:53.290
want to get back
to the improvising

00:32:53.290 --> 00:32:55.260
in a diatonic setting
that Eugene and I were

00:32:55.260 --> 00:32:55.970
doing earlier.

00:32:55.970 --> 00:32:57.345
And that's what
I want to do kind

00:32:57.345 --> 00:33:00.810
of with some of the
rest of this class.

00:33:00.810 --> 00:33:03.900
But for the
assignment, I actually

00:33:03.900 --> 00:33:05.460
want you guys to
work on something

00:33:05.460 --> 00:33:08.430
similar to what we
were just doing.

00:33:08.430 --> 00:33:10.930
We have a song, I'll
pass it out now.

00:33:10.930 --> 00:33:15.530
We have a song in our trio
repertoire called "Cargasian."

00:33:15.530 --> 00:33:17.320
This is it.

00:33:17.320 --> 00:33:18.070
FRIESEN: Oh, cool.

00:33:18.070 --> 00:33:19.470
I love this.

00:33:19.470 --> 00:33:22.570
RAY: And basically,
what I would like

00:33:22.570 --> 00:33:25.790
for you to do with
this-- check that out.

00:33:25.790 --> 00:33:30.650
This is actually written by our
trumpet player, Greg Hopkins.

00:33:30.650 --> 00:33:36.010
So of course, this
is a concert page.

00:33:36.010 --> 00:33:38.980
So I guess actually I think
our saxophone player is

00:33:38.980 --> 00:33:42.032
the only guy who's
going to have to--

00:33:42.032 --> 00:33:42.762
FRIESEN: Trumpet

00:33:42.762 --> 00:33:43.970
RAY: --do some transposition.

00:33:43.970 --> 00:33:47.590
But at any rate-- oboe, nice.

00:33:47.590 --> 00:33:55.630
So basically, like
I said, we treat--

00:33:55.630 --> 00:33:57.340
we'll play this
tonight in our concert,

00:33:57.340 --> 00:34:00.830
so you'll get to here
us do it as a trio.

00:34:00.830 --> 00:34:05.064
Basically as you can see,
there's just a melody line.

00:34:05.064 --> 00:34:06.105
Did I give you one, Mark?

00:34:06.105 --> 00:34:06.605
I'm sorry.

00:34:06.605 --> 00:34:07.487
No, I did.

00:34:07.487 --> 00:34:08.679
FRIESEN: I'll take one, too.

00:34:08.679 --> 00:34:13.260
RAY: So there's a melody
line, which you can see.

00:34:13.260 --> 00:34:15.850
And this is also a
12 bar blues form.

00:34:15.850 --> 00:34:20.300
So there's like a number one,
number two, number three.

00:34:20.300 --> 00:34:22.340
These are the
different sections.

00:34:22.340 --> 00:34:24.780
Number three you don't
have to worry about.

00:34:24.780 --> 00:34:27.219
The chord changes so much,
those are mostly just

00:34:27.219 --> 00:34:29.469
for my benefit as a pianist.

00:34:29.469 --> 00:34:31.500
When we play the melody,
we all play in unison.

00:34:31.500 --> 00:34:33.870
In other words, like
I said, no chords.

00:34:33.870 --> 00:34:35.909
It's all just playing
this melody in unison.

00:34:35.909 --> 00:34:38.600
So of course, the first
part of your assignment

00:34:38.600 --> 00:34:40.790
is to be able to play
the melody in time.

00:34:40.790 --> 00:34:44.070
It's similar tempo
to what we just did.

00:34:44.070 --> 00:34:47.159
[HUMMING]

00:34:47.159 --> 00:34:51.614
Nice little medium
swing kind of groove.

00:34:51.614 --> 00:34:52.530
You have to watch out.

00:34:52.530 --> 00:34:54.363
At the end there's some
three four measures.

00:34:54.363 --> 00:34:58.700
You do have to play the
three four measures.

00:34:58.700 --> 00:35:02.170
And then you see at the end on
the bottom of the page, solo

00:35:02.170 --> 00:35:03.520
over G minor blues.

00:35:03.520 --> 00:35:06.840
Now I know you guys have done
some work with the blues.

00:35:06.840 --> 00:35:10.120
These are very basic-- this
is sort of a basic Minor blues

00:35:10.120 --> 00:35:14.020
form, 12 bars.

00:35:14.020 --> 00:35:16.670
And basically, what I
would like for you to do

00:35:16.670 --> 00:35:21.660
is to take some of the
motives from the melody.

00:35:21.660 --> 00:35:24.650
And maybe Eugene
and I will play it

00:35:24.650 --> 00:35:27.290
once real quickly just
so you can hear it.

00:35:27.290 --> 00:35:29.200
Take some of the motives
from this melody.

00:35:29.200 --> 00:35:30.850
There's a few key things.

00:35:30.850 --> 00:35:33.350
I'm sure once you hear them,
you'll be able to identify them

00:35:33.350 --> 00:35:36.560
or you can circle
them or whatever.

00:35:36.560 --> 00:35:38.400
Work with some of these motives.

00:35:38.400 --> 00:35:42.910
Come up with some blues
improvisational ideas.

00:35:42.910 --> 00:35:46.320
And then what I'd like to
do when Greg and I come back

00:35:46.320 --> 00:35:48.710
on Monday is we'll
do essentially

00:35:48.710 --> 00:35:50.010
what Eugene and I were doing.

00:35:50.010 --> 00:35:53.590
I'll have you team up
in maybe twos or threes

00:35:53.590 --> 00:35:56.390
and do some improvisation
over the blues.

00:35:56.390 --> 00:36:04.130
And again a good way to
practice that is sit down

00:36:04.130 --> 00:36:05.390
with a metronome, right?

00:36:05.390 --> 00:36:07.890
I mean obviously, sitting down
with your friends is a better

00:36:07.890 --> 00:36:11.390
way to practice, but sitting
down with a metronome,

00:36:11.390 --> 00:36:15.620
having the metronome go, just
practicing improvisation.

00:36:15.620 --> 00:36:19.830
Like I say, we'll play
through some of these figures

00:36:19.830 --> 00:36:23.740
and have you kind of
identify some of those

00:36:23.740 --> 00:36:27.050
and maybe try to work those into
some of your improvisations.

00:36:27.050 --> 00:36:28.550
Can we play this
real quick, Eugene?

00:36:28.550 --> 00:36:30.030
FRIESEN: Let's find out.

00:36:30.030 --> 00:36:31.956
RAY: I guess we'll find out.

00:36:31.956 --> 00:36:33.080
FRIESEN: It's been a while.

00:36:33.080 --> 00:36:37.690
RAY: So like I said, we
always play this just

00:36:37.690 --> 00:36:42.270
in unison, the melody.

00:36:42.270 --> 00:36:45.020
On the way out, you'll hear
tonight at the concert,

00:36:45.020 --> 00:36:47.380
we try to do a sort of a
cannon with the melody.

00:36:47.380 --> 00:36:48.751
But we won't try the cannon now.

00:36:48.751 --> 00:36:50.250
FRIESEN: So for now
we're just going

00:36:50.250 --> 00:36:51.915
to read through three sections?

00:36:51.915 --> 00:36:53.706
RAY: We're just going
to read through them.

00:36:53.706 --> 00:36:55.710
FRIESEN: Just to
give the sound of it.

00:36:55.710 --> 00:36:57.310
RAY: A one, two three.

00:36:57.310 --> 00:36:58.340
[PLAYING MUSIC]

00:37:59.905 --> 00:38:03.390
RAY: Right, we're ending, yeah.

00:38:03.390 --> 00:38:05.605
And then the nice
diminished chord.

00:38:05.605 --> 00:38:07.230
That's what we always
teach you, right?

00:38:07.230 --> 00:38:09.700
End on a diminished chord?

00:38:09.700 --> 00:38:10.842
Good compositional.

00:38:10.842 --> 00:38:12.900
FRIESEN: Isn't that
a great melody?

00:38:12.900 --> 00:38:17.482
I mean, that's like just the
coolest, Buddhist design never.

00:38:17.482 --> 00:38:18.440
RAY: It's like a haiku.

00:38:18.440 --> 00:38:21.188
FRIESEN: All that
space around you.

00:38:21.188 --> 00:38:22.940
AUDIENCE: Why do you
put in bar lines?

00:38:22.940 --> 00:38:24.560
What's the point?

00:38:24.560 --> 00:38:26.850
FRIESEN: I think the
point is that we always

00:38:26.850 --> 00:38:28.890
are really aligned.

00:38:28.890 --> 00:38:31.112
We feel the beat together.

00:38:31.112 --> 00:38:32.070
And you have to, right?

00:38:32.070 --> 00:38:32.670
To play that.

00:38:32.670 --> 00:38:34.527
AUDIENCE: You have
to, but I don't

00:38:34.527 --> 00:38:35.809
feel the bar lines at all.

00:38:35.809 --> 00:38:36.600
FRIESEN: Don't you?

00:38:36.600 --> 00:38:38.322
Well, great.

00:38:38.322 --> 00:38:39.030
RAY: That's good.

00:38:39.030 --> 00:38:39.960
We like that.

00:38:39.960 --> 00:38:41.376
FRIESEN: As Tim
mentioned, we know

00:38:41.376 --> 00:38:44.310
we often do this in
unison then we'll play it

00:38:44.310 --> 00:38:48.770
as a round at a bar and two
beats, is that how we do it?

00:38:48.770 --> 00:38:49.520
Or one beat?

00:38:49.520 --> 00:38:52.533
RAY: We start off the
three of us on the way out.

00:38:52.533 --> 00:38:54.720
We play it unison together.

00:38:54.720 --> 00:38:56.950
Like I said, coming
tonight, you'll hear it.

00:38:56.950 --> 00:39:01.003
Then we do the improvisation,
which is like-- Whoops,

00:39:01.003 --> 00:39:02.448
I lost my microphone.

00:39:05.790 --> 00:39:08.430
The improvisation,
which is all three

00:39:08.430 --> 00:39:10.120
of us improvising
at the same time.

00:39:10.120 --> 00:39:13.080
It's not really like a
typical, one person's

00:39:13.080 --> 00:39:15.380
a soloist and another
person's an accompanist.

00:39:15.380 --> 00:39:17.850
FRIESEN: It's really
efficient time wise.

00:39:17.850 --> 00:39:19.360
RAY: It's true.

00:39:19.360 --> 00:39:22.406
Makes for a nice
short presentation.

00:39:22.406 --> 00:39:24.530
And then on the way out,
yeah as Eugene was saying,

00:39:24.530 --> 00:39:26.810
we do a round.

00:39:26.810 --> 00:39:32.300
We start off trumpet and then
one measure later is you.

00:39:32.300 --> 00:39:33.800
FRIESEN: At the bar, right.

00:39:33.800 --> 00:39:35.200
RAY: One bar.

00:39:35.200 --> 00:39:37.219
And then that piano
comes in one bar later.

00:39:37.219 --> 00:39:38.760
So you get sort of
this round effect.

00:39:38.760 --> 00:39:40.860
And then when we
get to section two,

00:39:40.860 --> 00:39:44.197
we condense it to two beats.

00:39:44.197 --> 00:39:45.780
And then when we get
to section three,

00:39:45.780 --> 00:39:47.190
we condense it to one beat.

00:39:47.190 --> 00:39:49.980
So we're only separated
by one beat apiece.

00:39:49.980 --> 00:39:51.920
It's kind of fun.

00:39:51.920 --> 00:39:54.642
It's sort of a fun game.

00:39:54.642 --> 00:39:59.120
AUDIENCE: Why did you decide to,
for example in measure seven,

00:39:59.120 --> 00:40:03.690
write a C flat instead
of the [INAUDIBLE]?

00:40:03.690 --> 00:40:05.700
RAY: That's a very
good question.

00:40:05.700 --> 00:40:10.180
I mean you might have to ask the
composer, Greg, who's not here.

00:40:10.180 --> 00:40:17.880
But my guess would be, although
there's no key signature.

00:40:17.880 --> 00:40:21.180
I mean I think of this
as in the key of G minor,

00:40:21.180 --> 00:40:22.270
which has got flats.

00:40:22.270 --> 00:40:25.240
So I think that's probably
what he would say.

00:40:25.240 --> 00:40:28.280
Although again, not having a
key signature that probably

00:40:28.280 --> 00:40:29.519
doesn't make a lot of sense.

00:40:29.519 --> 00:40:30.060
I don't know.

00:40:30.060 --> 00:40:31.520
What do you think?

00:40:31.520 --> 00:40:33.140
FRIESEN: I think
you're right now.

00:40:33.140 --> 00:40:35.440
RAY: But I think the idea
is that it's in a flat key,

00:40:35.440 --> 00:40:40.812
and so C flat would be a little
bit more conventional, for lack

00:40:40.812 --> 00:40:41.520
of a better word.

00:40:41.520 --> 00:40:43.880
I'm sort of one of those
guys where I actually

00:40:43.880 --> 00:40:47.037
prefer to see B natural if
I'm sight reading something.

00:40:47.037 --> 00:40:48.620
AUDIENCE: There is
a B natural, right?

00:40:48.620 --> 00:40:51.180
RAY: That's true that's true.

00:40:51.180 --> 00:40:51.680
OK.

00:40:51.680 --> 00:40:55.095
Well, now you've
completely stumped me.

00:40:55.095 --> 00:40:57.250
FRIESEN: It could be
the software, too.

00:40:57.250 --> 00:41:01.530
RAY: It could be the notation
software, which is oftentimes

00:41:01.530 --> 00:41:06.100
when musicians make unusual
choices, it's not actually

00:41:06.100 --> 00:41:08.732
a choice, if you
know what I mean.

00:41:08.732 --> 00:41:10.315
HARVEY: Can I just
make another point.

00:41:10.315 --> 00:41:13.151
I think it would be
interesting to ask

00:41:13.151 --> 00:41:14.734
Greg about when he
comes by on Monday.

00:41:14.734 --> 00:41:18.860
Because actually a lot of these
phrases in number one and two

00:41:18.860 --> 00:41:23.197
seem to be almost three beat
phrases if you look at it.

00:41:23.197 --> 00:41:23.905
RAY: That's true.

00:41:23.905 --> 00:41:26.112
HARVEY: --it really
anticipates and it then it

00:41:26.112 --> 00:41:28.024
goes into three, per se.

00:41:28.024 --> 00:41:30.414
So it's an interesting
[INAUDIBLE]

00:41:30.414 --> 00:41:33.210
with the kind of five
integral beats or whatever.

00:41:36.089 --> 00:41:36.880
RAY: I would agree.

00:41:36.880 --> 00:41:37.671
Yeah, you're right.

00:41:37.671 --> 00:41:40.739
They're not typical
phrase lengths.

00:41:40.739 --> 00:41:41.530
Yeah, you're right.

00:41:41.530 --> 00:41:44.620
There's a lot of threes,
three beat phrases.

00:41:47.650 --> 00:41:50.610
Anyway, the other thing I just
wanted to point out quickly

00:41:50.610 --> 00:41:55.330
was just, like I said,
you see obviously,

00:41:55.330 --> 00:41:59.940
if you're looking for
motives to grab onto.

00:41:59.940 --> 00:42:01.657
Well, maybe you
can tell me what's

00:42:01.657 --> 00:42:03.490
one thing you might
circle if you were going

00:42:03.490 --> 00:42:05.910
to try to pick out things
that make this melody

00:42:05.910 --> 00:42:07.880
unique or different
or interesting?

00:42:15.530 --> 00:42:16.920
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:42:16.920 --> 00:42:18.520
RAY: Right.

00:42:18.520 --> 00:42:23.310
The little ascending thing
at the beginning, right?

00:42:23.310 --> 00:42:26.630
You see that towards the end.

00:42:31.820 --> 00:42:34.190
You see it actually
all over the place.

00:42:34.190 --> 00:42:36.434
The second line.

00:42:36.434 --> 00:42:37.225
And the third line.

00:42:40.630 --> 00:42:43.230
Little ascending intervals.

00:42:43.230 --> 00:42:46.890
That's a nice one.

00:42:46.890 --> 00:42:49.276
How about the thing in section
two, the repeated note?

00:42:53.570 --> 00:42:56.340
That comes back again and
again in section two, right?

00:42:59.741 --> 00:43:01.490
And then the other
thing I would point out

00:43:01.490 --> 00:43:04.650
would be maybe this sort
of quarter note triplet

00:43:04.650 --> 00:43:07.630
thing, which comes in
once in the first section

00:43:07.630 --> 00:43:11.750
and then comes in again
in the second section.

00:43:11.750 --> 00:43:15.450
Again these are
all things you can

00:43:15.450 --> 00:43:19.150
try to incorporate
into an improvisation.

00:43:19.150 --> 00:43:20.530
So like I said,
this would be-- I

00:43:20.530 --> 00:43:23.970
think will be an interesting
thing to work on.

00:43:23.970 --> 00:43:30.310
And we'll get you guys playing
on this tune on Monday.

00:43:30.310 --> 00:43:31.130
Cool.

00:43:31.130 --> 00:43:34.520
So let's see.

00:43:37.380 --> 00:43:39.450
Getting back in kind
of the diatonic thing.

00:43:39.450 --> 00:43:42.130
I wanted to do that.

00:43:42.130 --> 00:43:44.000
Get you guys playing
a little bit.

00:43:49.986 --> 00:43:51.360
I guess I'll hand
out this thing.

00:43:55.400 --> 00:44:00.040
So basically, I mean this
is something you probably

00:44:00.040 --> 00:44:03.710
don't even need to look at, but
what we're going to try now,

00:44:03.710 --> 00:44:05.890
get into a little
bit, is just G major.

00:44:05.890 --> 00:44:08.970
And we're going to spend
some time in G major.

00:44:08.970 --> 00:44:11.240
So I hope you like G major.

00:44:11.240 --> 00:44:15.330
Conveniently a transposed
to A major for those of you

00:44:15.330 --> 00:44:16.442
who don't read.

00:44:16.442 --> 00:44:18.400
FRIESEN: Did you do the
transposition yourself?

00:44:18.400 --> 00:44:19.930
RAY: I did the
transposition myself.

00:44:19.930 --> 00:44:21.650
This was not done on a computer.

00:44:21.650 --> 00:44:24.420
This was done by hand,
the old fashioned way,

00:44:24.420 --> 00:44:25.740
with a needle and thread.

00:44:28.580 --> 00:44:31.501
Anyway, like I said, I
don't even necessarily

00:44:31.501 --> 00:44:33.000
why I'm handing
this out because I'm

00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:37.040
sure you guys all know
what a G major scale is.

00:44:37.040 --> 00:44:37.950
Well, Mark doesn't.

00:44:37.950 --> 00:44:40.190
We'll get Mark clued in.

00:44:46.530 --> 00:44:48.910
But I thought this might
be an interesting thing

00:44:48.910 --> 00:44:51.417
to spend some time with.

00:44:51.417 --> 00:44:53.500
And if we have time at the
end, maybe Eugene and I

00:44:53.500 --> 00:44:57.610
will play another piece from our
repertoire, our vast repertoire

00:44:57.610 --> 00:45:01.150
of duo songs.

00:45:01.150 --> 00:45:08.960
But basically, like I
said, the whole idea

00:45:08.960 --> 00:45:13.650
of doing improvisation in
a diatonic setting-- which

00:45:13.650 --> 00:45:16.070
as you heard from the
first piece we played,

00:45:16.070 --> 00:45:21.440
can really go as far
as you want it to go,

00:45:21.440 --> 00:45:26.417
or it can stay kind of
small, is a really, I

00:45:26.417 --> 00:45:28.000
think, an interesting
way to practice.

00:45:28.000 --> 00:45:29.708
And I think it's a
really interesting way

00:45:29.708 --> 00:45:32.550
to kind of develop a lot
of the improvisation skills

00:45:32.550 --> 00:45:35.910
that you use in other kinds of
improvisation, including atonal

00:45:35.910 --> 00:45:37.680
and jazz.

00:45:37.680 --> 00:45:40.440
Like I said, any
kind of improvisation

00:45:40.440 --> 00:45:44.380
you do, I think the
diatonic version of improv

00:45:44.380 --> 00:45:48.090
is I think a good way to--
it's a good, as Eugene said,

00:45:48.090 --> 00:45:51.190
limitation, a good way to
restrict the amount of things

00:45:51.190 --> 00:45:53.750
you have to think about.

00:45:53.750 --> 00:45:57.410
So it sounds like someone
is knocking on the door.

00:46:00.230 --> 00:46:01.240
Let's do this.

00:46:04.231 --> 00:46:05.980
I haven't really
necessarily planned this.

00:46:05.980 --> 00:46:07.610
But I'm going to do this.

00:46:07.610 --> 00:46:11.260
Eugene and I will do a little
bit of a G major improvisation.

00:46:11.260 --> 00:46:14.570
The other thing I'll point out
on the bottom of this page,

00:46:14.570 --> 00:46:16.785
again these are all
diatonic chords.

00:46:19.520 --> 00:46:21.080
Chris, you're a
piano player, right?

00:46:21.080 --> 00:46:25.106
Are there any other
piano players here today?

00:46:25.106 --> 00:46:25.606
Cool.

00:46:32.850 --> 00:46:35.990
So but for anybody who's
doing chordal instruments-- I

00:46:35.990 --> 00:46:41.150
see the banjo and the guitar--
obviously, one of the things,

00:46:41.150 --> 00:46:45.270
and of course Eugene
is as well versed

00:46:45.270 --> 00:46:47.160
in playing chordal
accompaniments,

00:46:47.160 --> 00:46:50.330
probably more so than
pretty much any other cello

00:46:50.330 --> 00:46:52.770
player I've ever met.

00:46:52.770 --> 00:46:54.017
It's one of his strengths.

00:46:54.017 --> 00:46:56.350
Again it's something you'll
see more evidence of tonight

00:46:56.350 --> 00:46:56.975
in the concert.

00:47:00.320 --> 00:47:03.900
But you see I've just drawn
out some basic diatonic chords.

00:47:03.900 --> 00:47:05.950
If we're in the key
of G major, these

00:47:05.950 --> 00:47:07.190
are all just seventh chords.

00:47:07.190 --> 00:47:07.680
And it's not necessary.

00:47:07.680 --> 00:47:09.680
It doesn't mean you have
to play seventh chords.

00:47:09.680 --> 00:47:13.060
But these are examples.

00:47:13.060 --> 00:47:20.380
G major, A minor, B minor,
C major, D seven, E minor,

00:47:20.380 --> 00:47:22.880
and then the minor
seven with a flat five

00:47:22.880 --> 00:47:25.420
if you go to the seventh
degree, F sharp, right.

00:47:25.420 --> 00:47:31.300
So these are all, in terms of
harmony, good source material.

00:47:31.300 --> 00:47:32.800
It doesn't necessarily
mean that you

00:47:32.800 --> 00:47:36.690
have to move them around a
lot or move around at all.

00:47:36.690 --> 00:47:39.790
Of course, but it's
again, thinking back

00:47:39.790 --> 00:47:42.170
to that first tune
we played, just

00:47:42.170 --> 00:47:46.410
using a major scale
as a source material,

00:47:46.410 --> 00:47:49.010
there are just so many
options in terms of harmony.

00:47:49.010 --> 00:47:53.060
Sometimes like I said, those of
us who come from a jazz world,

00:47:53.060 --> 00:47:57.260
we're used to things
moving more, moving quickly

00:47:57.260 --> 00:48:00.670
and in a less diatonic fashion.

00:48:00.670 --> 00:48:04.550
But again, like I said, just in
the diatonic areas, you know,

00:48:04.550 --> 00:48:06.530
you've got 7 chords right here.

00:48:06.530 --> 00:48:08.030
And then you've got
all these chords

00:48:08.030 --> 00:48:09.410
with different kinds of roots.

00:48:09.410 --> 00:48:14.570
You know you've got G major
with a third in the bottom.

00:48:14.570 --> 00:48:19.900
You can do a C major with
the fifth on the bottom.

00:48:19.900 --> 00:48:22.540
You can do again, like I
said, all of these things.

00:48:34.600 --> 00:48:35.930
You've got a lot.

00:48:35.930 --> 00:48:39.280
Even just in the diatonic realm,
you've got a lot of options

00:48:39.280 --> 00:48:40.900
as chordal instruments.

00:48:40.900 --> 00:48:47.580
So let's do a short little
improv in G. Can we do that?

00:48:47.580 --> 00:48:54.000
And then we'll get you
guys to come in on this.

00:48:54.000 --> 00:48:59.002
Actually and Alex,
you're a vocalist.

00:48:59.002 --> 00:49:00.210
ALEX: Yeah, I'm doing vocals.

00:49:00.210 --> 00:49:00.790
FRIESEN: You're doing vocals.

00:49:00.790 --> 00:49:01.289
All right.

00:49:01.289 --> 00:49:02.220
Cool.

00:49:02.220 --> 00:49:02.730
All right.

00:49:02.730 --> 00:49:05.750
So we'll get you all involved.

00:49:05.750 --> 00:49:07.670
So actually let's do this.

00:49:07.670 --> 00:49:09.560
We'll start.

00:49:09.560 --> 00:49:11.650
At some point, I'll get you.

00:49:11.650 --> 00:49:12.940
We'll swap places, Chris.

00:49:12.940 --> 00:49:15.190
But for now, Eugene
and I will start.

00:49:15.190 --> 00:49:20.320
And then maybe James,
we'll get you to come in.

00:49:20.320 --> 00:49:21.860
At some point I'll
give you a nod,

00:49:21.860 --> 00:49:24.010
and you can come in and join us.

00:49:24.010 --> 00:49:25.780
And maybe one of
us will drop out,

00:49:25.780 --> 00:49:27.420
or we might just keep going.

00:49:27.420 --> 00:49:32.450
So we'll just do a little
bit of round robin,

00:49:32.450 --> 00:49:34.486
bring you guys in,
brings guys out.

00:49:34.486 --> 00:49:37.090
We need your note cards, Mark.

00:49:40.870 --> 00:49:44.160
You guys have all seen the
Aardvark Big Band, right?

00:49:44.160 --> 00:49:46.900
Do you still use the note cards?

00:49:46.900 --> 00:49:48.500
I always love that system.

00:49:48.500 --> 00:49:52.460
Mark's got the system of
like, to cue the entire band,

00:49:52.460 --> 00:49:58.390
he holds up a card that
says letter E. It's great.

00:49:58.390 --> 00:50:02.180
HARVEY: Our festival jazz band
direct, he's now swiped that.

00:50:02.180 --> 00:50:03.520
RAY: Oh, he swiped it from you.

00:50:03.520 --> 00:50:05.395
HARVEY: Big concert on
Saturday, and everyone

00:50:05.395 --> 00:50:08.862
was using his own card.

00:50:08.862 --> 00:50:11.567
Imitation is the
sincerest form of--

00:50:11.567 --> 00:50:13.799
[LAUGHING]

00:50:13.799 --> 00:50:15.340
FRIESEN: The sincerest
form of theft.

00:50:20.795 --> 00:50:21.420
RAY: All right.

00:50:21.420 --> 00:50:25.120
So like I said, I haven't
really planned this.

00:50:25.120 --> 00:50:27.447
So we'll see where this goes.

00:50:27.447 --> 00:50:28.280
Why don't you start?

00:50:31.154 --> 00:50:33.549
[PLAYING MUSIC]

00:52:10.753 --> 00:52:11.253
RAY: James.

00:53:15.584 --> 00:53:17.500
Sorry I've forgotten
your name, next to James.

00:53:17.500 --> 00:53:18.488
AUSTIN: Austin.

00:53:18.488 --> 00:53:18.988
RAY: Austin.

00:54:47.010 --> 00:54:48.504
How about some trumpet?

00:55:35.316 --> 00:55:37.308
Want to put some oboe in there?

00:55:43.481 --> 00:55:43.980
Uh oh.

00:55:43.980 --> 00:55:44.479
Dry reed.

00:55:47.898 --> 00:55:49.710
That's OK.

00:55:49.710 --> 00:55:52.984
Adrian, can you come
in on some guitar?

00:55:52.984 --> 00:55:53.567
Oh, I'm sorry.

00:55:53.567 --> 00:55:54.150
You're Adrian.

00:56:22.220 --> 00:56:23.190
Try some chords.

00:56:23.190 --> 00:56:24.860
Try C major.

00:56:47.120 --> 00:56:50.140
RAY: Can we get some flute?

00:56:50.140 --> 00:56:50.640
Yeah.

00:57:08.918 --> 00:57:10.888
And some banjo?

00:57:10.888 --> 00:57:11.388
Yeah.

00:57:20.280 --> 00:57:21.756
Nice.

00:57:21.756 --> 00:57:22.256
Yeah.

00:57:30.500 --> 00:57:32.250
Alex, want to try
some long tones?.

00:57:39.016 --> 00:57:40.012
Yeah, yeah.

00:57:47.480 --> 00:57:47.980
Nice.

00:57:53.458 --> 00:57:54.950
Try some oboe?

00:57:54.950 --> 00:57:55.450
Yeah.

00:57:59.930 --> 00:58:00.430
Nice.

00:58:03.416 --> 00:58:03.916
Yeah.

00:58:13.874 --> 00:58:14.374
Yeah.

00:58:19.354 --> 00:58:21.346
Nice.

00:58:21.346 --> 00:58:23.350
Wanna try some flute, Adrian?

00:58:23.350 --> 00:58:23.950
Yeah.

00:58:23.950 --> 00:58:27.631
We'll get the whole thing going.

00:58:27.631 --> 00:58:29.619
Yeah.

00:58:29.619 --> 00:58:32.598
Chris, why don't you jump in?

00:58:32.598 --> 00:58:33.098
Yeah.

00:58:41.544 --> 00:58:42.044
Mhm.

00:58:53.472 --> 00:58:53.972
Yeah.

00:59:17.328 --> 00:59:17.828
Yeah.

00:59:42.678 --> 00:59:43.200
Nice.

00:59:43.200 --> 00:59:43.700
All right.

00:59:46.130 --> 00:59:46.630
Beautiful.

00:59:46.630 --> 00:59:48.930
That was great-- that was great.

00:59:48.930 --> 00:59:49.530
Yeah.

00:59:49.530 --> 00:59:52.730
It is-- it's hard to
jump out there, right?

00:59:52.730 --> 00:59:54.927
I know, especially when
your reed's not wet.

00:59:54.927 --> 00:59:55.760
AUDIENCE: [LAUGHTER]

00:59:55.760 --> 00:59:57.190
HARVEY: Then it's really hard.

00:59:57.190 --> 01:00:01.420
But no, seriously though,
it's hard to put yourself out

01:00:01.420 --> 01:00:02.960
there sometimes.

01:00:02.960 --> 01:00:05.340
And again, I know
you guys have been

01:00:05.340 --> 01:00:08.130
working with Tom on
some improvisation.

01:00:08.130 --> 01:00:11.930
I imagine you've probably
been doing some group stuff.

01:00:11.930 --> 01:00:17.560
There's always a little safety
in numbers kind of mindset,

01:00:17.560 --> 01:00:19.160
which, I know, is totally cool.

01:00:19.160 --> 01:00:22.750
But, you know, frankly, what's
nice is that I could tell you

01:00:22.750 --> 01:00:24.260
guys were all listening.

01:00:24.260 --> 01:00:26.590
You're kind of trying
to find the group,

01:00:26.590 --> 01:00:32.470
find the place to go, find the
place to be, where you're not

01:00:32.470 --> 01:00:34.530
where you're not
sticking out-- you're

01:00:34.530 --> 01:00:37.570
contributing without
going too far.

01:00:37.570 --> 01:00:39.912
Which is great,
listening is obviously

01:00:39.912 --> 01:00:40.995
one of the biggest things.

01:00:44.060 --> 01:00:46.462
You have anything you want
to try with these guys?

01:00:46.462 --> 01:00:47.170
FRIESEN: Oh sure.

01:00:47.170 --> 01:00:48.700
PROFESSOR: We have a whole
room full of musicians

01:00:48.700 --> 01:00:49.877
who are versed in G major.

01:00:49.877 --> 01:00:50.710
FRIESEN: Oh, I know.

01:00:50.710 --> 01:00:53.380
That's so great.

01:00:53.380 --> 01:01:01.460
I might just say that, in
terms of you are what you eat,

01:01:01.460 --> 01:01:03.110
I've always been
intrigued with how

01:01:03.110 --> 01:01:05.180
to practice to become
a better improviser.

01:01:05.180 --> 01:01:09.090
I mean, at first I thought
improvising was just

01:01:09.090 --> 01:01:11.590
a state of being.

01:01:11.590 --> 01:01:16.640
It really was not anything
you can prepare for.

01:01:16.640 --> 01:01:19.070
But that could not be
further from the truth.

01:01:19.070 --> 01:01:24.750
You know, preparation
plays a huge part

01:01:24.750 --> 01:01:27.450
in being a good improviser.

01:01:27.450 --> 01:01:30.220
So sometimes I
think about using--

01:01:30.220 --> 01:01:32.820
if you think of your brain in
two different parts, you know,

01:01:32.820 --> 01:01:34.960
the left brain and
the right brain.

01:01:34.960 --> 01:01:38.860
You think of that left
brain as being the rigor

01:01:38.860 --> 01:01:40.680
part of your brain,
the part of your brain

01:01:40.680 --> 01:01:43.790
that is curious about music.

01:01:43.790 --> 01:01:48.880
Odd meters, scales, seventh
chords dominant chords,

01:01:48.880 --> 01:01:53.400
chord substitutions, diminished
chords, diminished scales.

01:01:53.400 --> 01:01:55.710
All these things
are exotic foods

01:01:55.710 --> 01:01:58.422
that are just very
enjoyable for us musicians.

01:01:58.422 --> 01:01:59.880
We get fascinated
with them, and we

01:01:59.880 --> 01:02:01.600
want to spend time with them.

01:02:01.600 --> 01:02:04.060
They're are like my kids
when I got them art supplies.

01:02:04.060 --> 01:02:07.740
They would not only use the art
supplies as they were intended,

01:02:07.740 --> 01:02:10.400
but of course, they wanted
to taste it, and put it

01:02:10.400 --> 01:02:14.170
on the walls, and on their
clothes, and on your clothes.

01:02:14.170 --> 01:02:15.570
It was everywhere.

01:02:15.570 --> 01:02:19.600
They wanted it to be a full
body sensory experience.

01:02:19.600 --> 01:02:25.340
It was something kind of
elemental as a major scale

01:02:25.340 --> 01:02:27.490
and the modes of that scale.

01:02:27.490 --> 01:02:30.480
Each of these modes
and each of these keys

01:02:30.480 --> 01:02:35.180
are things that you may
understand with facility

01:02:35.180 --> 01:02:38.550
at first glance,
and yet, there's

01:02:38.550 --> 01:02:42.840
no way of predicting how
your understanding of them

01:02:42.840 --> 01:02:47.080
will be enhanced by your
spending time with each one.

01:02:47.080 --> 01:02:51.250
So for example, I
have a CD of drones.

01:02:51.250 --> 01:02:52.810
It's just-- maybe
you have these,

01:02:52.810 --> 01:02:55.290
too-- it's just a
root and a fifth

01:02:55.290 --> 01:02:58.280
and a couple of different
octaves in all 12 keys,

01:02:58.280 --> 01:03:00.930
and each track on the
CD is six minutes long.

01:03:00.930 --> 01:03:04.210
So one day, I might say,
OK, today's Phrygian day.

01:03:04.210 --> 01:03:07.000
And I'll go through, and
I'll just let the CD roll.

01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:10.640
And I'll play six minutes
improvised in Phrygian mode

01:03:10.640 --> 01:03:14.020
through all 12 keys in that day.

01:03:14.020 --> 01:03:16.580
Just as an example of
how you can use drones,

01:03:16.580 --> 01:03:18.580
as a very simple example.

01:03:18.580 --> 01:03:20.380
But I think what I
wanted to say, mostly,

01:03:20.380 --> 01:03:25.590
was that your curiosity and
your loving attention to each

01:03:25.590 --> 01:03:28.840
of these musical elements
is something that goes deep

01:03:28.840 --> 01:03:33.720
inside your being, inside
your inner musician.

01:03:33.720 --> 01:03:36.570
And then these become
the tools that you

01:03:36.570 --> 01:03:39.920
use, the colors that you
use, to really portray

01:03:39.920 --> 01:03:43.200
your expressiveness, when
you're in a situation

01:03:43.200 --> 01:03:47.240
that you can access
these things intuitively.

01:03:47.240 --> 01:03:49.290
So one of the things
that I really love

01:03:49.290 --> 01:03:51.000
is odd meters, for example.

01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:52.972
I've been fascinated
with the odd meters.

01:03:52.972 --> 01:03:54.680
And we haven't really
spoken about rhythm

01:03:54.680 --> 01:03:58.670
that much, but really, the
success of this improv we just

01:03:58.670 --> 01:04:01.790
did was really mostly
about this little motor

01:04:01.790 --> 01:04:04.050
that we set up at
the beginning of it,

01:04:04.050 --> 01:04:06.070
and varying it in so
many different ways

01:04:06.070 --> 01:04:09.780
with syncopation, and
keeping it moving along.

01:04:09.780 --> 01:04:15.170
And using the odd
numbers in rhythm,

01:04:15.170 --> 01:04:18.940
I think there's a lot of power
and a lot of energy in there.

01:04:18.940 --> 01:04:23.190
So we could think
about 3, for example.

01:04:23.190 --> 01:04:27.970
Even 3/4 is such a
magical kind of place

01:04:27.970 --> 01:04:30.600
to be in, because
with quarter notes,

01:04:30.600 --> 01:04:35.870
with in each quarter note,
we have 12/16 in each bar.

01:04:35.870 --> 01:04:38.230
And 12 is a great number.

01:04:38.230 --> 01:04:42.310
It not only has all this
astrological significance,

01:04:42.310 --> 01:04:46.270
but, of course, is
divisible by 2, 3, 4, and 6.

01:04:46.270 --> 01:04:47.900
So for us musicians,
there's just

01:04:47.900 --> 01:04:52.650
a whole storehouse of energy and
rhythmic tension and propulsion

01:04:52.650 --> 01:04:55.590
available with that number 12.

01:04:55.590 --> 01:04:58.910
So let's take 3/4,
and, first of all,

01:04:58.910 --> 01:05:01.290
let's just play
some kind of pattern

01:05:01.290 --> 01:05:06.200
that we are subdividing
with the quarter pulses.

01:05:06.200 --> 01:05:07.785
Can you play along with me?

01:05:12.410 --> 01:05:13.660
Anything you can come up with.

01:05:13.660 --> 01:05:15.622
You can just play
16th notes, but really

01:05:15.622 --> 01:05:16.830
feature those quarter pulses.

01:05:19.610 --> 01:05:22.801
Can I hear all the 16th notes,
but just accent the quarters.

01:05:22.801 --> 01:05:23.301
Keep going.

01:05:30.657 --> 01:05:31.157
Nice.

01:05:33.886 --> 01:05:34.594
That's beautiful.

01:05:37.531 --> 01:05:38.031
Great.

01:05:38.031 --> 01:05:40.010
Let's try another way now.

01:05:40.010 --> 01:05:41.830
I'll keep this quarter
pulse, but now we're

01:05:41.830 --> 01:05:44.330
going to come up with a pattern,
where we accent every three

01:05:44.330 --> 01:05:45.192
notes.

01:05:45.192 --> 01:05:46.650
So this is essentially,
we're going

01:05:46.650 --> 01:05:51.830
to be playing four groups of
three notes in the same amount

01:05:51.830 --> 01:05:55.950
of time as we were playing
three groups of four notes.

01:05:55.950 --> 01:05:56.610
Do you follow?

01:05:56.610 --> 01:05:59.020
So we were doing 1-2-3-4,
1-2-3-4 1-2-3-4, 1,

01:05:59.020 --> 01:06:01.880
now we're going to do 1-2-3,
1-2-3, 1-2-3, 1-2-3, 1-2-3,

01:06:01.880 --> 01:06:03.760
1-2-3.

01:06:03.760 --> 01:06:07.050
So find a three note
pattern where you can really

01:06:07.050 --> 01:06:10.210
feature the first note of each.

01:06:10.210 --> 01:06:12.520
Go ahead.

01:06:12.520 --> 01:06:17.876
1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1.

01:06:50.140 --> 01:06:51.820
I can tell you guys
feel it already.

01:06:51.820 --> 01:06:53.560
That's really, really fun to do.

01:06:53.560 --> 01:06:57.150
So let's see if we can a
little round, where we'll

01:06:57.150 --> 01:07:01.080
start with the people doing
the quarter pulses, and after,

01:07:01.080 --> 01:07:03.240
let's say, two bars,
the other group

01:07:03.240 --> 01:07:04.980
will come in with
the quarter pulses,

01:07:04.980 --> 01:07:08.620
while the first group
shifts to the three pulses.

01:07:08.620 --> 01:07:09.850
OK.

01:07:09.850 --> 01:07:13.060
And Chris, you can be on
this side-- up through,

01:07:13.060 --> 01:07:17.680
let's see, one, two, three,
four, Ja-- up through Jacob,

01:07:17.680 --> 01:07:21.400
and then the rest of you
are in the second team, OK.

01:07:21.400 --> 01:07:24.794
We'll start with two bars of
3/4 doing the quarter pulses,

01:07:24.794 --> 01:07:26.585
and then we're going
to evolve to the three

01:07:26.585 --> 01:07:28.989
pulses, the dotted
eighth note pulses,

01:07:28.989 --> 01:07:30.530
while they come in
the quarter pulse.

01:07:30.530 --> 01:07:31.050
Clear?

01:07:31.050 --> 01:07:32.386
One?

01:07:32.386 --> 01:07:33.670
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] not
clear-- so what's going on?

01:07:33.670 --> 01:07:35.170
FRIESEN: After two
bars, you come in

01:07:35.170 --> 01:07:36.500
with a quarter pulse figure.

01:07:36.500 --> 01:07:38.390
AUDIENCE: And then
they'll switch?

01:07:38.390 --> 01:07:40.200
FRIESEN: They'll switch
when you come in--

01:07:40.200 --> 01:07:41.491
AUDIENCE: And we'll just stay--

01:07:41.491 --> 01:07:43.610
FRIESEN: And you'll
switch after two bars.

01:07:43.610 --> 01:07:46.160
You're going to go to the
dotted eighth note figure,

01:07:46.160 --> 01:07:47.520
the three figure we just did.

01:07:47.520 --> 01:07:49.130
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

01:07:49.130 --> 01:07:50.380
FRIESEN: We just cycle.

01:07:50.380 --> 01:07:53.050
We'll just come back to what
we were doing before, OK?

01:07:53.050 --> 01:07:54.950
1, 2, 3.

01:07:58.310 --> 01:08:00.230
2, 2 switch.

01:08:05.391 --> 01:08:05.890
Switch.

01:08:09.940 --> 01:08:10.930
And switch.

01:08:15.875 --> 01:08:16.375
Switch.

01:08:22.810 --> 01:08:25.319
OK, you got it?

01:08:25.319 --> 01:08:27.960
Let's try a little duet, just
quickly, and see if we do it?

01:08:27.960 --> 01:08:30.310
Does everyone feel
comfortable with this?

01:08:30.310 --> 01:08:33.270
Let's try a flute and oboe duet.

01:08:33.270 --> 01:08:35.580
And you don't have to
choose which roles you have,

01:08:35.580 --> 01:08:36.901
and you don't have to switch.

01:08:36.901 --> 01:08:38.609
But let's say the
first person who starts

01:08:38.609 --> 01:08:41.990
will start with a quarter
note kind of feel.

01:08:41.990 --> 01:08:46.729
And this is just about rhythm,
it's not so much about melody.

01:08:46.729 --> 01:08:52.550
So see if you can just make this
kind of poly-rhythm evident.

01:08:52.550 --> 01:08:55.830
We've got the 4 and the
3 going simultaneously.

01:08:55.830 --> 01:08:57.670
So let's try a
flute and oboe duet.

01:08:57.670 --> 01:09:01.420
It's going to be like a 45
second, or 49 second world

01:09:01.420 --> 01:09:01.919
premiere.

01:09:44.430 --> 01:09:48.540
That's it, yeah
guys, good for you.

01:09:48.540 --> 01:09:51.859
What do you think?

01:09:51.859 --> 01:09:54.292
Do you like it?

01:09:54.292 --> 01:09:55.750
AUDIENCE: It feels
like a template.

01:09:55.750 --> 01:09:56.400
I feel like if we--

01:09:56.400 --> 01:09:56.900
FRIESEN: Exactly.

01:09:56.900 --> 01:09:57.780
AUDIENCE: --got
very used to this,

01:09:57.780 --> 01:09:59.321
we could do lots of
innovative things

01:09:59.321 --> 01:10:01.110
once this becomes second nature.

01:10:01.110 --> 01:10:02.600
FRIESEN: Exactly right.

01:10:02.600 --> 01:10:05.070
It's a template.

01:10:05.070 --> 01:10:06.570
That's a great way
of looking at it.

01:10:06.570 --> 01:10:07.861
Let's try another one of these.

01:10:07.861 --> 01:10:12.180
Let's try a James
and trumpet duet.

01:10:19.370 --> 01:10:21.140
I'm sorry to interrupt
already-- this

01:10:21.140 --> 01:10:24.440
is totally cool-- you don't
have to play all the 16th notes.

01:10:24.440 --> 01:10:27.060
You can play a resulting
rhythm that just plays down

01:10:27.060 --> 01:10:30.340
a funky quarter note feel,
for example, you know I mean?

01:10:30.340 --> 01:10:31.640
And feel free to switch.

01:10:31.640 --> 01:10:33.420
In fact, let's make that a
little rule of this duet.

01:10:33.420 --> 01:10:35.170
That at some point you're
going to switch roles.

01:10:35.170 --> 01:10:35.669
OK?

01:10:40.629 --> 01:10:41.670
Don't try to plan it out.

01:10:41.670 --> 01:10:43.591
You'll just screw it up.

01:10:43.591 --> 01:10:44.466
AUDIENCE: [LAUGHTER].

01:11:44.156 --> 01:11:45.280
FRIESEN: Good for you guys.

01:11:45.280 --> 01:11:45.750
Yeah.

01:11:45.750 --> 01:11:46.250
That's cool.

01:11:48.702 --> 01:11:50.160
What I love about
it, too, and what

01:11:50.160 --> 01:11:51.900
we haven't talked
all about-- and that

01:11:51.900 --> 01:11:57.560
is how to make an
accompaniment, in a kind of pure

01:11:57.560 --> 01:11:59.250
and very exposed
setting like this.

01:11:59.250 --> 01:12:01.940
And you guys are really
good at that already.

01:12:01.940 --> 01:12:07.700
I found you gravitating towards
that melody and accompaniment

01:12:07.700 --> 01:12:13.110
role between you, which is
a great musical instinct.

01:12:13.110 --> 01:12:14.437
I love how you did that.

01:12:14.437 --> 01:12:16.270
RAY: And something that
a lot a horn players

01:12:16.270 --> 01:12:17.890
don't think about
because you're thinking--

01:12:17.890 --> 01:12:18.530
FRIESEN: So true

01:12:18.530 --> 01:12:20.196
RAY: --about playing
melodies and leads.

01:12:20.196 --> 01:12:21.640
FRIESEN: I know, I know.

01:12:21.640 --> 01:12:23.180
I really notice it
because the cello

01:12:23.180 --> 01:12:25.290
has this tradition
of accompanying.

01:12:25.290 --> 01:12:28.900
The written repertoire
is really 90%

01:12:28.900 --> 01:12:30.190
playing accompaniment roles.

01:12:30.190 --> 01:12:32.390
So I really appreciate
it when I come

01:12:32.390 --> 01:12:35.050
across a violinist
or a trumpet player

01:12:35.050 --> 01:12:37.810
who is sensitive to that--
or a drummer-- who's really

01:12:37.810 --> 01:12:41.290
a great accompanist,
really appreciate it.

01:12:41.290 --> 01:12:45.250
Anyway, just as an example of
how a kind of musical element--

01:12:45.250 --> 01:12:49.060
in this case, the four against
three-- with curiosity,

01:12:49.060 --> 01:12:52.920
as you experiment with
this, you will gradually

01:12:52.920 --> 01:12:55.840
find yourself wanting
to compose stuff.

01:12:55.840 --> 01:13:01.426
You'll be improvising stuff that
you get attracted to and just

01:13:01.426 --> 01:13:02.800
through being
drawn to something,

01:13:02.800 --> 01:13:07.750
with your natural curiosity with
the musician's love for music.

01:13:07.750 --> 01:13:09.850
You'll find yourself
wanting to expand it,

01:13:09.850 --> 01:13:12.581
and with your
loving curiosity, it

01:13:12.581 --> 01:13:14.330
will grow into something
that could either

01:13:14.330 --> 01:13:19.550
be a composition, or just part
of your personal vocabulary,

01:13:19.550 --> 01:13:21.502
for your personal comfort.

01:13:21.502 --> 01:13:23.290
I think that's
kind of what we do,

01:13:23.290 --> 01:13:30.960
is collect this quiver full
of musical arrows of all

01:13:30.960 --> 01:13:32.650
kinds of different descriptions.

01:13:32.650 --> 01:13:35.700
And rhythmically, it's just
a huge, huge great world.

01:13:35.700 --> 01:13:40.440
So I envy you, that you've got
this long life ahead of you

01:13:40.440 --> 01:13:43.320
to check all this stuff out.

01:13:43.320 --> 01:13:44.490
I do, too.

01:13:44.490 --> 01:13:46.730
I'm doing the same thing.

01:13:46.730 --> 01:13:47.961
RAY: Indeed.

01:13:47.961 --> 01:13:49.335
FRIESEN: Where
are, we time wise?

01:13:49.335 --> 01:13:51.464
HARVEY: We have about
maybe five minutes more.

01:13:51.464 --> 01:13:52.130
RAY: Yeah, cool.

01:13:52.130 --> 01:13:57.820
I just wanted to mention
that Eugene, as I mentioned,

01:13:57.820 --> 01:14:00.090
we both are teaching
at the Berklee College,

01:14:00.090 --> 01:14:02.730
and if you ever get
a chance to hear--

01:14:02.730 --> 01:14:05.340
and I don't know
if you guys wander

01:14:05.340 --> 01:14:08.010
all the way across
the river to Boston,

01:14:08.010 --> 01:14:10.530
there's another city
over there-- they've

01:14:10.530 --> 01:14:11.990
got some cool things going on.

01:14:11.990 --> 01:14:15.550
Anyway, no seriously,
if you ever

01:14:15.550 --> 01:14:21.200
see a notification for a group
called the Berklee World String

01:14:21.200 --> 01:14:23.840
Orchestra, it's led by Eugene.

01:14:23.840 --> 01:14:27.310
It's a string orchestra,
as you might expect.

01:14:27.310 --> 01:14:30.210
It's got all the string players,
many of the string players

01:14:30.210 --> 01:14:31.460
to go to Berklee.

01:14:31.460 --> 01:14:34.944
And one of the things that's
remarkable about this group,

01:14:34.944 --> 01:14:36.360
besides the fact
that many of them

01:14:36.360 --> 01:14:39.360
are actually really
good improvisers,

01:14:39.360 --> 01:14:41.950
is that Eugene does
amazing work getting

01:14:41.950 --> 01:14:45.510
them to play rhythmically-- and
getting them to play rhythms

01:14:45.510 --> 01:14:49.430
in all kinds of different
styles of music, world music.

01:14:49.430 --> 01:14:50.720
A lot of original stuff.

01:14:53.920 --> 01:14:56.030
A lot of remarkable
repertoire that they do.

01:14:56.030 --> 01:14:59.410
But like I said, a lot of
it is based on-- at least

01:14:59.410 --> 01:15:01.940
my concept of what
Eugene does-- is based

01:15:01.940 --> 01:15:05.550
on working with rhythms
with this ensemble.

01:15:05.550 --> 01:15:09.140
And without a doubt
it's worth checking out,

01:15:09.140 --> 01:15:10.627
if you get a chance to see that.

01:15:10.627 --> 01:15:12.210
FRIESEN: One of the
ideas of the group

01:15:12.210 --> 01:15:16.520
was to activate the great
world of rhythm, especially

01:15:16.520 --> 01:15:21.650
from Africa, and South
America, and North America,

01:15:21.650 --> 01:15:24.170
with jazz-- well,
all over the world--

01:15:24.170 --> 01:15:25.620
without a rhythm section.

01:15:25.620 --> 01:15:28.990
So all the rhythms
are really spread out

01:15:28.990 --> 01:15:30.600
and written into the parts.

01:15:30.600 --> 01:15:36.560
There's this great interlocking,
[INAUDIBLE] and all the parts

01:15:36.560 --> 01:15:38.910
are rhythmic, and I
think pretty fun to play.

01:15:38.910 --> 01:15:41.090
And that's the
experiment-- making

01:15:41.090 --> 01:15:44.420
rhythmic use of
string instruments.

01:15:44.420 --> 01:15:46.630
RAY: So we just have
a few minutes left.

01:15:46.630 --> 01:15:49.990
Are there any other questions?

01:15:49.990 --> 01:15:50.997
Yes.

01:15:50.997 --> 01:15:53.122
AUDIENCE: So I was talking
to someone the other day

01:15:53.122 --> 01:15:54.981
about perfect pitch.

01:15:54.981 --> 01:15:56.480
There's this notion
that some people

01:15:56.480 --> 01:15:58.206
have inborn perfect pitch.

01:15:58.206 --> 01:16:01.940
And they are, from
birth, are annoyed

01:16:01.940 --> 01:16:04.770
if something is a couple
cents sharper than they

01:16:04.770 --> 01:16:05.933
remember it being.

01:16:05.933 --> 01:16:06.766
Something like this.

01:16:09.360 --> 01:16:12.140
I don't have anything
like that, but as I

01:16:12.140 --> 01:16:16.740
listen to more and more
music, the different pitches

01:16:16.740 --> 01:16:18.630
start to feel different.

01:16:18.630 --> 01:16:21.500
And they have these distinct
sort of personalities.

01:16:21.500 --> 01:16:23.366
And we haven't talked
about this much,

01:16:23.366 --> 01:16:25.366
and I haven't heard people
in improvisation talk

01:16:25.366 --> 01:16:26.680
about this at all.

01:16:26.680 --> 01:16:28.310
But you use that kind of thing?

01:16:28.310 --> 01:16:31.210
So you feel like the pitches
have different feelings, colors

01:16:31.210 --> 01:16:33.330
to them that you can use?

01:16:33.330 --> 01:16:36.380
The same thing, maybe
transposed up a couple steps

01:16:36.380 --> 01:16:37.325
would feel different?

01:16:40.030 --> 01:16:44.760
RAY: Yeah, that's an
interesting question, actually.

01:16:44.760 --> 01:16:45.440
I do.

01:16:45.440 --> 01:16:49.910
I feel like different
notes, different keys,

01:16:49.910 --> 01:16:53.410
have different feelings to them.

01:16:53.410 --> 01:16:57.720
I mean, I'm one of those
people that has perfect pitch.

01:16:57.720 --> 01:17:00.042
I don't necessarily--
to get back

01:17:00.042 --> 01:17:01.500
to what we were
saying originally--

01:17:01.500 --> 01:17:04.670
I don't necessarily
know if the piano

01:17:04.670 --> 01:17:08.620
is tuned at 442
versus 440-- maybe

01:17:08.620 --> 01:17:12.040
there are people that
tuned in-- I'm not.

01:17:12.040 --> 01:17:15.780
But I suspect most
people aren't.

01:17:15.780 --> 01:17:20.005
But yeah, it's something,
and it's interesting,

01:17:20.005 --> 01:17:22.380
too, the other thing I thinking
about as you were talking

01:17:22.380 --> 01:17:26.910
was, from an
improvisational standpoint,

01:17:26.910 --> 01:17:30.390
often people sometimes come
up to me, and they ask me,

01:17:30.390 --> 01:17:31.500
do you have perfect pitch?

01:17:31.500 --> 01:17:32.500
I say, well, yeah, I do.

01:17:32.500 --> 01:17:35.900
And they go, oh, that must make
it so much easier to improvise.

01:17:35.900 --> 01:17:38.850
Well, no, it's not that easy.

01:17:38.850 --> 01:17:41.270
It's not that simple.

01:17:41.270 --> 01:17:47.110
And I know, again, only
speaking from my own experience,

01:17:47.110 --> 01:17:50.320
it does help in some
small ways, I suppose.

01:17:50.320 --> 01:17:53.790
If, you know, Eugene and
I walk out on a stage,

01:17:53.790 --> 01:17:58.190
and without talking about it,
he just starts bowing a note,

01:17:58.190 --> 01:18:01.980
having perfect pitch will tell
me, oh he's started on A flat.

01:18:01.980 --> 01:18:05.940
But once he starts playing,
and I start playing,

01:18:05.940 --> 01:18:07.440
you don't think
about perfect pitch.

01:18:07.440 --> 01:18:11.422
I'm not analyzing, oh,
his D is a little sharp.

01:18:11.422 --> 01:18:13.130
And I don't know,
that's going to bug me.

01:18:13.130 --> 01:18:14.560
No, no, no.

01:18:14.560 --> 01:18:16.190
I'm not going to--
if I were to try

01:18:16.190 --> 01:18:18.984
to be that analytical in the
moment, it would drive me nuts.

01:18:18.984 --> 01:18:20.900
AUDIENCE: I was more
talking about aesthetics.

01:18:20.900 --> 01:18:23.460
I was more talking about
what sort of a bearing

01:18:23.460 --> 01:18:28.920
does the aesthetic of different
keys have on your feeling--

01:18:28.920 --> 01:18:32.940
FRIESEN: Well, in my case,
my experience of music

01:18:32.940 --> 01:18:35.900
is related to the cello because
I've had this thing in my lap

01:18:35.900 --> 01:18:37.400
since I was 10 years old.

01:18:37.400 --> 01:18:40.660
So when I hear a
note, I can kind of

01:18:40.660 --> 01:18:42.860
imagine where it
is on the cello.

01:18:42.860 --> 01:18:46.070
And that's the way that
I know what note it is,

01:18:46.070 --> 01:18:50.170
but it's also the way I can
visualize what key a melody is

01:18:50.170 --> 01:18:52.880
going to sound good
in, because of how

01:18:52.880 --> 01:18:55.878
it will sound on the cello.

01:18:55.878 --> 01:18:57.402
Yeah.

01:18:57.402 --> 01:18:58.860
And then I think
an interesting way

01:18:58.860 --> 01:19:03.640
to play with that is to
transpose as much as you

01:19:03.640 --> 01:19:06.030
possibly can in all 12 keys.

01:19:06.030 --> 01:19:08.480
You know, start with a
simple melody, and just

01:19:08.480 --> 01:19:12.760
the head of a tune, or an
eight bar phrase, or 16 bars,

01:19:12.760 --> 01:19:14.510
and try playing it all 12 keys.

01:19:14.510 --> 01:19:16.100
And take your time.

01:19:16.100 --> 01:19:18.240
If you're like I am,
it'll take a long time

01:19:18.240 --> 01:19:20.410
to get through 12 keys at first.

01:19:20.410 --> 01:19:25.250
But eventually, you begin to
open to how the intervals work,

01:19:25.250 --> 01:19:29.090
and hear how your instrument
sounds in all those 12 keys.

01:19:29.090 --> 01:19:31.570
And that's another way
to sensitize yourself

01:19:31.570 --> 01:19:35.345
about how you react emotionally
to what key something is in.

01:19:35.345 --> 01:19:38.170
It's very personal,
but it's very real.

01:19:38.170 --> 01:19:39.562
That was a good question.

01:19:39.562 --> 01:19:40.270
RAY: It is, yeah.

01:19:40.270 --> 01:19:44.327
And I think, just
one short comment,

01:19:44.327 --> 01:19:46.160
because we talk about
with improvisation, we

01:19:46.160 --> 01:19:49.810
talk about feelings and being
in touch with how things feel,

01:19:49.810 --> 01:19:51.340
and how things sound.

01:19:51.340 --> 01:19:53.530
And I think the key
that something's

01:19:53.530 --> 01:19:55.140
in is one of those things.

01:19:55.140 --> 01:19:59.510
One of those things that
gives you information.

01:19:59.510 --> 01:20:03.264
If I sit down and
play a B minor chord,

01:20:03.264 --> 01:20:05.180
that's going to give me
a certain feeling that

01:20:05.180 --> 01:20:06.971
would be a little bit
different if I played

01:20:06.971 --> 01:20:10.190
an A minor chord
or a B major chord.

01:20:10.190 --> 01:20:14.830
So that all kind of gets
mixed in, for me at least,

01:20:14.830 --> 01:20:15.800
the key something is.

01:20:15.800 --> 01:20:16.580
I think it does.

01:20:16.580 --> 01:20:20.610
It gets mixed into how I how I
approach it as an improviser.

01:20:20.610 --> 01:20:24.270
And which is why what Eugene
says a great idea, you know,

01:20:24.270 --> 01:20:26.080
you learn to tune,
and you say, OK,

01:20:26.080 --> 01:20:29.570
cool, I'm feeling really good
about playing blues in F.

01:20:29.570 --> 01:20:33.000
And now try blues in D flat.

01:20:33.000 --> 01:20:34.727
It's going to feel
really different.

01:20:34.727 --> 01:20:37.060
Partly because you probably
don't play in D flat as well

01:20:37.060 --> 01:20:38.768
you do in F, but partly
just because it's

01:20:38.768 --> 01:20:40.100
going to sound different.

01:20:40.100 --> 01:20:43.940
So I hope that answers
your question a little bit.

01:20:43.940 --> 01:20:45.510
Any other-- Yeah.

01:20:45.510 --> 01:20:46.010
Adrian?

01:20:46.010 --> 01:20:47.634
AUDIENCE: So you
mentioned [INAUDIBLE].

01:20:51.389 --> 01:20:54.078
Do you have any other
useful exercises sort

01:20:54.078 --> 01:21:02.640
of like [INAUDIBLE] practice
certain improvision skills.

01:21:02.640 --> 01:21:06.578
RAY: Excercises for
practicing improvisation?

01:21:06.578 --> 01:21:09.830
AUDIENCE: Just like for
practicing songs [INAUDIBLE].

01:21:09.830 --> 01:21:14.800
RAY: Right, yeah
there's so many.

01:21:14.800 --> 01:21:17.381
FRIESEN: There's some
great technology, too,

01:21:17.381 --> 01:21:19.130
you guys have probably
checked out, right.

01:21:19.130 --> 01:21:21.980
I mean, everything
from a looper pedal,

01:21:21.980 --> 01:21:25.260
so you can make your own
loop, and practice along

01:21:25.260 --> 01:21:27.772
with it to Band in a Box.

01:21:27.772 --> 01:21:31.000
And iReal b, the
iPhone app, where

01:21:31.000 --> 01:21:35.810
you can play tune, in
any key, in any tempo.

01:21:35.810 --> 01:21:37.540
Those are all great things.

01:21:37.540 --> 01:21:40.320
I think it should be driven--
in my personal opinion--

01:21:40.320 --> 01:21:43.480
it should be driven by your
curiosity for what you really

01:21:43.480 --> 01:21:44.590
love.

01:21:44.590 --> 01:21:48.490
You know, any time it becomes
an intellectual exercise,

01:21:48.490 --> 01:21:52.430
it's something to be aware of.

01:21:52.430 --> 01:21:55.740
I would counsel to gravitate
towards things that you're

01:21:55.740 --> 01:22:01.480
really, truly drawn
to that gives you

01:22:01.480 --> 01:22:02.990
an emotional response.

01:22:02.990 --> 01:22:05.280
We talked about the
one side of the brain,

01:22:05.280 --> 01:22:07.660
the rigor side of the
brain, and the other,

01:22:07.660 --> 01:22:10.740
I sometimes refer to as the
surrender part of the brain.

01:22:10.740 --> 01:22:13.300
In other words,
when I improvise,

01:22:13.300 --> 01:22:18.360
I often place myself in
this kind of more open mode.

01:22:18.360 --> 01:22:21.035
It's where the
music just is there,

01:22:21.035 --> 01:22:22.410
and I'm contributing
to the music

01:22:22.410 --> 01:22:24.110
without having to
analyze it, or try

01:22:24.110 --> 01:22:26.250
to remember anything
I practiced.

01:22:26.250 --> 01:22:28.995
It's really just a way of
being with your imagination

01:22:28.995 --> 01:22:33.320
and with your more
open, emotional state

01:22:33.320 --> 01:22:34.710
inside the music.

01:22:34.710 --> 01:22:37.360
That's something that's
hard to practice in school.

01:22:37.360 --> 01:22:40.300
So that's why it's so
important to find a place

01:22:40.300 --> 01:22:43.320
to practice that you're
comfortable in, that hopefully

01:22:43.320 --> 01:22:46.217
sounds good for your instrument,
and spend some time there,

01:22:46.217 --> 01:22:48.425
just making the connection
between how you're feeling

01:22:48.425 --> 01:22:50.220
and how it sounds.

01:22:50.220 --> 01:22:52.680
How comfortable you
are and what you love.

01:22:52.680 --> 01:22:54.360
RAY: Yeah, I think that's great.

01:22:54.360 --> 01:22:56.540
I think that's great advice.

01:22:56.540 --> 01:23:02.540
I mean, just again
piggybacking a little bit

01:23:02.540 --> 01:23:08.015
on what Eugene was saying,
oftentimes, you'll find things.

01:23:08.015 --> 01:23:10.390
You'll find things that excite
you when you're listening.

01:23:10.390 --> 01:23:14.460
You'll hear something at a
concert or on a recording,

01:23:14.460 --> 01:23:15.910
and you'll go, wow that's great.

01:23:15.910 --> 01:23:19.820
And I think this
is how most of us

01:23:19.820 --> 01:23:22.180
do it, and have done
it, for our lives.

01:23:22.180 --> 01:23:27.700
For me, I would be in college,
sitting in a class and Mark

01:23:27.700 --> 01:23:29.190
Harvey, or whoever
my teacher was,

01:23:29.190 --> 01:23:34.350
would put on a recording
of, you know, Bill Evans.

01:23:34.350 --> 01:23:36.700
And I'm like, wow, I've
never heard this before.

01:23:36.700 --> 01:23:39.075
I've never heard someone play
the piano like that before.

01:23:39.075 --> 01:23:42.520
And then it's like, OK, now I
got to go check out Bill Evans.

01:23:42.520 --> 01:23:46.110
And now, after having
done that, my playing

01:23:46.110 --> 01:23:47.610
has little bit of
that in it, right?

01:23:47.610 --> 01:23:51.240
Because he's one of
my favorite pianists.

01:23:51.240 --> 01:23:54.710
I think that's sort of
what Eugene is saying.

01:23:54.710 --> 01:23:58.310
Stuff that you're drawn to,
explore it, jump into it.

01:23:58.310 --> 01:24:00.410
It can be anything
and everything,

01:24:00.410 --> 01:24:03.970
but then once you
start exploring it,

01:24:03.970 --> 01:24:05.780
then you'll find resources.

01:24:05.780 --> 01:24:08.370
You'll find transcriptions
of Bill Evans solos,

01:24:08.370 --> 01:24:09.950
and, of course,
recordings, which

01:24:09.950 --> 01:24:13.510
are very easy to get,
mostly, nowadays.

01:24:13.510 --> 01:24:18.170
And like I said, there's
a lot of good resources

01:24:18.170 --> 01:24:20.290
out there for working
on improvisation.

01:24:20.290 --> 01:24:24.060
But just find things that you're
drawn to, even if it's just

01:24:24.060 --> 01:24:28.160
six measures of a
John Coltrane solo.

01:24:28.160 --> 01:24:30.170
It's like, I love
those six measures.

01:24:30.170 --> 01:24:31.650
I got to learn
those six measures.

01:24:31.650 --> 01:24:33.740
I got to get them--
I got to have them.

01:24:33.740 --> 01:24:37.380
And you learn them, and
you start playing on them,

01:24:37.380 --> 01:24:39.129
or it could be anything.

01:24:39.129 --> 01:24:40.670
FRIESEN: The stranger
your interests,

01:24:40.670 --> 01:24:42.900
the more interesting of a
player you'll end up being.

01:24:42.900 --> 01:24:45.650
RAY: It's true.

01:24:45.650 --> 01:24:46.740
So, cool.

01:24:46.740 --> 01:24:48.650
FRIESEN: You are what you eat.

01:24:48.650 --> 01:24:50.300
Watch your diet.

01:24:50.300 --> 01:24:51.930
RAY: Watch your diet.

01:24:51.930 --> 01:24:52.530
So.

01:24:52.530 --> 01:24:54.330
HARVEY: Wise words
on which to end.

01:24:54.330 --> 01:24:57.630
Let's give him hand.

01:24:57.630 --> 01:25:00.080
FRIESEN: Nice to hang
out with you guys.
