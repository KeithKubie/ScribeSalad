it's played out across time so you could
 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:31.759
it's played out across time so you could
say that that thing is the same as music

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769
say that that thing is the same as music
 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:33.530
say that that thing is the same as music
but it's kind of like a slice of music

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540
but it's kind of like a slice of music

unfolding that's the same it's the same

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770
unfolding that's the same it's the same
 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:45.590
unfolding that's the same it's the same
idea you can imagine that being set to

idea you can imagine that being set to
 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.090

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189
bring it down and destroy it and that's
 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:24.830
bring it down and destroy it and that's
partly because you can see this in the

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840
partly because you can see this in the
 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:27.980
partly because you can see this in the
story of Cain and Abel table is

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990

hard-working and everyone likes him and
he makes the proper sacrifices and so

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500
he makes the proper sacrifices and so
 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.499
he makes the proper sacrifices and so
his life goes really well and that's

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509
his life goes really well and that's
 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:34.999
his life goes really well and that's
part of the reason that Cain hates him

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009
part of the reason that Cain hates him
 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:37.999
part of the reason that Cain hates him
and he's jealous and resentful but worse

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009
and he's jealous and resentful but worse
 

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:39.830
and he's jealous and resentful but worse
than that if you're around someone if

than that if you're around someone if
you're not doing very well especially if

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850
you're not doing very well especially if
 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:44.060
you're not doing very well especially if

doing very well and you're around
someone who's doing very well it's very

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009
someone who's doing very well it's very
 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:49.219
someone who's doing very well it's very
painful because the mere fact of their

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229
painful because the mere fact of their
 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:52.730
painful because the mere fact of their
being judges you and so it's very easy

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740
being judges you and so it's very easy
 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:54.889
being judges you and so it's very easy
to want to destroy that to destroy that

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899
to want to destroy that to destroy that
 

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:56.899

with the terrible consequences of seeing
it embodied in front of you and so part

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780
it embodied in front of you and so part
 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:05.060
it embodied in front of you and so part
of the reason that people want to tear

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070
of the reason that people want to tear
 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:07.190
of the reason that people want to tear
things down is so that they don't have

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200
things down is so that they don't have
 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.559
things down is so that they don't have
anything to contrast themselves against

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569
anything to contrast themselves against
 

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:10.880
anything to contrast themselves against
and to feel bad and that's exactly

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890
and to feel bad and that's exactly
 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:12.710
and to feel bad and that's exactly
what's happening here the kids are

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720
what's happening here the kids are
 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:13.940
what's happening here the kids are
destroying all of this

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950
destroying all of this
 

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:20.720
destroying all of this
culture roughly speaking because it

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:20.730
culture roughly speaking because it
 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:22.640
culture roughly speaking because it
judges them the fact that it exists

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:22.650
judges them the fact that it exists
 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:24.530
judges them the fact that it exists
judges them and I've often thought this

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:24.540
judges them and I've often thought this
 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:26.199
judges them and I've often thought this
about Michelangelo's Statue of David

00:02:26.199 --> 00:02:26.209
about Michelangelo's Statue of David
 

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:29.000
about Michelangelo's Statue of David
which is this heroics so David was a

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:29.010
which is this heroics so David was a
 

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:31.729
which is this heroics so David was a
shepherd obviously and it doesn't sound

00:02:31.729 --> 00:02:31.739
shepherd obviously and it doesn't sound
 

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:34.460
shepherd obviously and it doesn't sound
like much but back in those times being

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:34.470
like much but back in those times being
 

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:35.960
like much but back in those times being
a shepherd was a big deal because their

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:35.970
a shepherd was a big deal because their
 

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:38.630
a shepherd was a big deal because their
reliance and you had a slingshot and so

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:38.640
reliance and you had a slingshot and so
 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:40.910
reliance and you had a slingshot and so
like you got to defend your sheep from

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:40.920
like you got to defend your sheep from
 

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:42.589
like you got to defend your sheep from

lions with a slingshot
 

00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:44.539
lions with a slingshot
so you weren't exactly this like 19th

00:02:44.539 --> 00:02:44.549
so you weren't exactly this like 19th
 

00:02:44.549 --> 00:02:46.910
so you weren't exactly this like 19th
