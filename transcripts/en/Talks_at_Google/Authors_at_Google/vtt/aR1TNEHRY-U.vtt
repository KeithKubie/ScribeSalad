PRESENTER: So, everyone,
thanks for stopping

00:00:03.890 --> 00:00:06.150
by for another outstanding
talk at Google.

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:08.770
It's great to see so many
attention-respectful Googlers

00:00:08.770 --> 00:00:10.167
here in the audience.

00:00:10.167 --> 00:00:11.750
We're taking a look
today at something

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:13.970
that's quite relevant
to the daily life

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:16.860
that we lead-- technology
and organization.

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:19.200
After all, we are here
to organize the world's

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:21.060
information and
make it universally

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:23.360
accessible and
useful, so they say.

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:26.250
Today we're pleased to
host Dr. Daniel Levitin.

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:28.900
He's stopping by to
assist us in this journey.

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:31.630
He's the bestselling author
of "The World In Six Songs"

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:33.640
and "This Is Your
Brain on Music."

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:37.230
And today, he speaks to us about
the organized mind, thinking

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:40.020
straight in the age of
information overload.

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:42.205
Taking views from
neuroscience and from history,

00:00:42.205 --> 00:00:45.600
he takes the latest research
in cognitive psychology

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.900
and brings it to the
masses in a book that's

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:49.860
really quite interesting.

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:52.427
So if you'll please join me
in welcoming him to Google,

00:00:52.427 --> 00:00:53.760
we'll get started with the talk.

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:54.259
Thank you.

00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:02.370
DANIEL LEVITIN: Well, thank you
for having me back at Google.

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:03.610
I'm delighted to be here.

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:08.665
Everyone has been so
nice since I got here.

00:01:08.665 --> 00:01:10.802
A few engineers came
up to me and said,

00:01:10.802 --> 00:01:13.260
it was so nice to be able to
put a face with all that click

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.176
traffic they've been
watching all these years.

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:20.276
I want to talk about
three big ideas,

00:01:20.276 --> 00:01:22.150
and then I'd be happy
to take some questions.

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:28.970
The three big ideas are
multitasking, brain extenders,

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:32.580
and decision making in the
age of information overload.

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:35.280
But first, I'll give
you a little glimpse

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:36.830
into why I wrote the book.

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:39.820
Neuroscientists in
the last 10 years

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:43.910
have learned quite a bit about
why the brain pays attention

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:46.760
to some things and
forgets others.

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:49.800
And most of that information
hasn't trickled down

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:51.100
to the average person.

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:52.770
And I think that
all of us can use

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:55.160
this information
in our daily lives

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:59.270
to better organize our time,
our homes, and workplaces.

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:02.880
And I wrote the
book a way to share

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:04.830
what it was that we
as a field had learned

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:07.639
and to give some
practical tips about how

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:08.639
to use that information.

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:13.765
The three big ideas.

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:20.300
First, some numbers, just
to quantify what it is we

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:22.450
mean by information overload.

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:25.770
Americans, as you know
better than anyone else,

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:29.300
take in five times
more information today

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:32.150
than they did in 1986.

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:35.930
That's the equivalent
of 174 newspapers

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:36.805
worth of information.

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:41.460
During our leisure
time alone, we

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:44.220
process 34 gigabytes
of information.

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:47.940
And we've created
a world that has

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:51.880
300 exabytes of
human-made information.

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:57.350
Just one person's share of that,
your share of the 300 exabytes,

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:59.990
if each piece of information
pertaining to you

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:03.540
was written on a
three-by-five index card

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:06.000
and laid out end to
end, side by side,

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:11.399
it would cover all of the
square miles of Massachusetts

00:03:11.399 --> 00:03:12.440
and Connecticut combined.

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:17.070
An overwhelming
amount of information.

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:21.030
So no wonder most of us are
feeling like we can't keep up.

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:26.192
And if you like watching YouTube
for work or for relaxation,

00:03:26.192 --> 00:03:28.650
and you feel like you want to
keep up with what's happening

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:31.710
and what's new there,
as you probably know,

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:36.710
every hour, YouTube uploads
6,000 hours of new video.

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:39.290
So that means for every hour
of YouTube video you watch,

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:43.080
you're following
5,999 hours behind.

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:44.770
The only way you
could possibly keep up

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:48.090
is if you had 6,000
screens going all at once.

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:51.180
And I'm sure at some
point in the near future,

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:54.030
that number is going to
double and keep on doubling.

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:56.050
So enormous amount
of information.

00:03:56.050 --> 00:03:57.630
What can we do about it?

00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:00.540
Well, what many of us do
about it is we multitask.

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:04.130
We do a whole bunch of things
at once, figuring that that way,

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:06.007
we can manage all
of the stuff that's

00:04:06.007 --> 00:04:07.590
coming at us from
all different sides.

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:12.830
But it turns out that
multitasking is a myth.

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:16.260
And there's now ample research
that justifies and supports

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:16.760
this.

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:18.910
I know that it's part
of Google culture

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:22.610
to have transmitted this
information to all of you.

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:25.570
Multitasking does not exist.

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:28.710
What's actually happening in
the brain is sequential tasking.

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:32.570
The brain is rapidly shifting
from one thing to the next.

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:35.864
It's doing it so
quickly and seamlessly

00:04:35.864 --> 00:04:38.280
that you don't really notice,
but that's what's happening.

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:40.620
And what you end up
with is attention

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:43.350
that's been fractionated into
little three to five seconds

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:46.080
bits, and you're not
able to actually sustain

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:47.540
attention on any one thing.

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:53.430
Multitasking can release
the stress hormone cortisol,

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:55.680
which might make you feel
at the end of a couple hours

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:57.620
like your head has been
in a salad spinner.

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:04.150
Multitasking is also
responsible for that mental fog

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:08.300
that you feel, partly due
to the release of cortisol.

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:09.800
So you're not saving time.

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:10.690
You're wasting time.

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:15.095
There are actually very few
jobs that require multitasking.

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:19.640
One of them is air
traffic controller.

00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:24.510
Another is simultaneous
translator at the UN.

00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:30.604
And those jobs have high costs
if the worker makes a mistake.

00:05:30.604 --> 00:05:32.770
It's obvious if you make a
mistake as an air traffic

00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:36.980
controller, the consequences
can be calamity, disastrous.

00:05:36.980 --> 00:05:39.440
Same for simultaneous
translators at the UN.

00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:42.370
You get one word wrong, you
may have a war on your hands.

00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:45.250
So these jobs,
it's no coincidence

00:05:45.250 --> 00:05:47.590
that they have mandated breaks.

00:05:47.590 --> 00:05:50.452
People in those high-stress
jobs, air traffic controllers,

00:05:50.452 --> 00:05:52.660
for example, they're not
allowed to work more than 45

00:05:52.660 --> 00:05:56.540
or 60 minutes without taking
a 15 to 30 minute break.

00:05:56.540 --> 00:05:58.580
That's their duty cycle.

00:05:58.580 --> 00:06:01.170
A couple of other jobs
that require multitasking

00:06:01.170 --> 00:06:01.810
come to mind.

00:06:01.810 --> 00:06:04.970
One is kindergarten
teacher, and the other

00:06:04.970 --> 00:06:07.970
is publicist or social
network consultant,

00:06:07.970 --> 00:06:11.850
and another is journalist,
breaking news journalist.

00:06:11.850 --> 00:06:14.190
But apart from that,
it's not really

00:06:14.190 --> 00:06:16.070
a job requirement
for most of us.

00:06:16.070 --> 00:06:18.890
And it ends up at
the end of the day,

00:06:18.890 --> 00:06:21.220
based on a number of
productivity studies,

00:06:21.220 --> 00:06:24.870
the people who were multitasking
were getting less done

00:06:24.870 --> 00:06:27.860
by any measure than the
people who were unitasking.

00:06:29.060 --> 00:06:31.150
Now, why does it feel
like we're multitasking?

00:06:31.150 --> 00:06:32.120
Well, it's an illusion.

00:06:33.990 --> 00:06:35.790
As a neuroscientist,
I can tell you,

00:06:35.790 --> 00:06:37.630
the brain is very
good at self-delusion.

00:06:37.630 --> 00:06:39.760
That's one thing that
it's really good at.

00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:42.080
And we see it in a
lot of different ways.

00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:43.969
I, for one, know that
I look a lot better

00:06:43.969 --> 00:06:45.010
after I've been drinking.

00:06:46.670 --> 00:06:48.850
But people tell me that
that's self-delusion.

00:06:48.850 --> 00:06:51.320
I'm also a lot more clever
and a better fighter

00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:54.010
after I've had a few
drinks, or so I think.

00:06:55.460 --> 00:06:59.790
So the brain doesn't always have
insights into what it's good at

00:06:59.790 --> 00:07:01.070
and what it's not good at.

00:07:01.070 --> 00:07:03.632
We're deceiving ourselves when
we think we're multitasking.

00:07:03.632 --> 00:07:04.340
We really aren't.

00:07:04.340 --> 00:07:06.640
The productivity
studies bear this out.

00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:09.660
So what can you do about it?

00:07:09.660 --> 00:07:14.020
Well, we can take a tip from
the air traffic controllers

00:07:14.020 --> 00:07:15.407
and the simultaneous
translators,

00:07:15.407 --> 00:07:16.365
and we can take breaks.

00:07:17.610 --> 00:07:20.290
And workers who are allowed to
do this in a number of studies

00:07:20.290 --> 00:07:24.250
in a number of industries
end up being more productive

00:07:24.250 --> 00:07:26.700
and creating better
quality work.

00:07:27.970 --> 00:07:30.540
You have to decide what
the appropriate breaks are

00:07:30.540 --> 00:07:32.040
depending on the
kind of work you do

00:07:32.040 --> 00:07:34.290
and depending on how
your brain works.

00:07:34.290 --> 00:07:37.700
But a good rule of thumb
is every couple hours,

00:07:37.700 --> 00:07:38.970
take 15 minutes off.

00:07:40.520 --> 00:07:44.480
Naps are also very
helpful, short naps.

00:07:45.900 --> 00:07:49.420
Even a 10 or 15 minute nap
in the middle of the day

00:07:49.420 --> 00:07:51.550
can be the equivalent
of an hour and a half

00:07:51.550 --> 00:07:54.030
of extra sleep the
night before, and it

00:07:54.030 --> 00:07:56.839
can raise your effective
IQ by 10 points.

00:07:56.839 --> 00:07:57.880
So naps are a good thing.

00:07:57.880 --> 00:08:00.660
And I read somewhere that
Google has nap rooms,

00:08:00.660 --> 00:08:02.710
at least in some
of the facilities.

00:08:02.710 --> 00:08:04.240
Is this true?

00:08:04.240 --> 00:08:06.580
So this is already a
part of your culture.

00:08:06.580 --> 00:08:09.620
But I'm saying it because
this is being taped

00:08:09.620 --> 00:08:11.570
and this will go out
beyond Google, I guess.

00:08:12.724 --> 00:08:14.640
Other companies have
been promoting this, too.

00:08:14.640 --> 00:08:18.050
Safeway Stores, the grocery
chain in the East Bay,

00:08:18.050 --> 00:08:20.350
has nap rooms and
exercise rooms.

00:08:20.350 --> 00:08:23.464
These are all critical
because of the underlying

00:08:23.464 --> 00:08:24.130
neurophysiology.

00:08:25.400 --> 00:08:30.510
The nap helps to restore your
depleted sources of glucose

00:08:30.510 --> 00:08:33.539
in the brain, which
I'll get to in a minute.

00:08:33.539 --> 00:08:35.500
And the breaks
allow you to enter

00:08:35.500 --> 00:08:37.159
a different attentional mode.

00:08:37.159 --> 00:08:39.730
And I want to talk
about that for a minute,

00:08:39.730 --> 00:08:44.540
about what the
vacations that you take

00:08:44.540 --> 00:08:46.569
are doing for you
neurophysiologically

00:08:46.569 --> 00:08:48.360
and what the breaks
and the naps are doing.

00:08:49.830 --> 00:08:53.090
There are two dominant modes of
attention in the human brain.

00:08:53.090 --> 00:08:56.310
One goes by the
rather inelegant name

00:08:56.310 --> 00:08:58.530
of the task-positive network.

00:08:58.530 --> 00:09:04.120
More colloquially, this is the
central executive of the brain.

00:09:04.120 --> 00:09:07.370
It's the part of your brain
that is engaged in a task,

00:09:07.370 --> 00:09:08.950
and you're not distracted.

00:09:08.950 --> 00:09:10.850
So you might be
writing a report,

00:09:10.850 --> 00:09:13.070
or doing research,
or reading a book,

00:09:13.070 --> 00:09:14.380
engaging in a conversation.

00:09:14.380 --> 00:09:16.700
But if you're focused and
you're not distracted,

00:09:16.700 --> 00:09:18.530
you're in that mode.

00:09:18.530 --> 00:09:20.320
The second dominant
mode of the brain

00:09:20.320 --> 00:09:23.320
is called the
task-negative network,

00:09:23.320 --> 00:09:25.220
and it's when you're
not doing a task

00:09:25.220 --> 00:09:27.270
and your mind is wondering.

00:09:27.270 --> 00:09:31.040
And this is a part of the brain,
a network of brain regions,

00:09:31.040 --> 00:09:34.220
that has been called the
default mode of the brain,

00:09:34.220 --> 00:09:37.310
because it exerts a pull on
that other part of your brain,

00:09:37.310 --> 00:09:40.730
and it's a kind of natural state
that the brain wants to go to.

00:09:40.730 --> 00:09:42.980
So I'm sure you've all had
this experience that you're

00:09:42.980 --> 00:09:45.600
reading a book,
and at some point

00:09:45.600 --> 00:09:48.190
your eyes get ahead of
where you are in the book.

00:09:48.190 --> 00:09:52.160
And you realize, well, your eyes
have been following the words,

00:09:52.160 --> 00:09:53.160
but your brain hasn't.

00:09:53.160 --> 00:09:55.850
And you've got to go back a
ways and figure out-- well,

00:09:55.850 --> 00:09:58.820
that's the mind wandering
mode that has kicked in.

00:09:58.820 --> 00:10:00.620
It's not that your
brain had shut off.

00:10:00.620 --> 00:10:03.600
You were just thinking other
thoughts, maybe stimulated

00:10:03.600 --> 00:10:05.440
by what you had read.

00:10:05.440 --> 00:10:08.740
So this mind wandering
mode turns out

00:10:08.740 --> 00:10:12.430
to be very different from
the task engagement mode,

00:10:12.430 --> 00:10:15.910
because it's where thoughts
that are loosely connected

00:10:15.910 --> 00:10:18.610
seamlessly flow into one
another, like in a dream.

00:10:18.610 --> 00:10:20.590
That's why we call
it daydreaming.

00:10:20.590 --> 00:10:24.150
And you begin to see
connections between things

00:10:24.150 --> 00:10:25.900
that you didn't see
as connected before.

00:10:27.690 --> 00:10:30.470
Loosely-affiliated
thoughts flow into one

00:10:30.470 --> 00:10:35.750
another, non-linear
kinds of thinking,

00:10:35.750 --> 00:10:38.100
sometimes juxtapositions
of different ideas.

00:10:39.230 --> 00:10:44.660
This is the mode of thinking
where your most creative acts

00:10:44.660 --> 00:10:49.130
are likely to occur, and
where problem solving is

00:10:49.130 --> 00:10:50.337
apt to occur.

00:10:50.337 --> 00:10:52.420
So I'm sure you've had
this experience that you're

00:10:52.420 --> 00:10:54.910
trying to solve some
problem, work something out.

00:10:54.910 --> 00:10:56.000
You focus on it.

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:56.980
You're getting nowhere.

00:10:56.980 --> 00:10:58.630
You drop it for a while.

00:10:58.630 --> 00:11:00.840
You might be out
shopping, and suddenly, it

00:11:00.840 --> 00:11:02.480
hits you, the answer.

00:11:02.480 --> 00:11:04.610
That's the daydreaming
mode having kicked in.

00:11:04.610 --> 00:11:07.430
It usually kicks in when you're
doing something else that

00:11:07.430 --> 00:11:10.130
doesn't require a lot of focus,
and so the daydreaming mode

00:11:10.130 --> 00:11:11.140
takes over.

00:11:11.140 --> 00:11:14.270
And if you use a little
bit of self-reflection

00:11:14.270 --> 00:11:16.250
and think back, or the
next time it happens,

00:11:16.250 --> 00:11:17.565
analyze what's going on.

00:11:17.565 --> 00:11:19.440
It's probably that the
solution was something

00:11:19.440 --> 00:11:22.970
that wasn't obvious before, or
you would have thought of it.

00:11:22.970 --> 00:11:25.770
It's something that required a
non-linear thinking or putting

00:11:25.770 --> 00:11:27.735
together, piecing together
of disparate ideas

00:11:27.735 --> 00:11:30.290
that you hadn't seen
as connected before.

00:11:30.290 --> 00:11:33.630
So problem solving depends on
this other mode of the brain.

00:11:33.630 --> 00:11:36.010
And it's essential
for all of us who

00:11:36.010 --> 00:11:39.090
are engaged in
creative pursuits to be

00:11:39.090 --> 00:11:41.760
able to go back and forth
between the two modes.

00:11:43.100 --> 00:11:47.980
Now, attention switching, such
as we do during multitasking,

00:11:47.980 --> 00:11:51.890
and decision making
deplete fuel in the brain.

00:11:53.190 --> 00:11:54.995
Specifically, they
deplete glucose.

00:11:56.180 --> 00:11:58.510
Glucose is the fuel
that neurons need.

00:11:58.510 --> 00:12:01.110
Neurons are living
cells with metabolism,

00:12:01.110 --> 00:12:03.125
and they need glucose
in order to function.

00:12:04.150 --> 00:12:06.980
And glucose is not in
an unlimited supply.

00:12:06.980 --> 00:12:09.480
Every decision that you make
depletes a little glucose.

00:12:09.480 --> 00:12:13.360
Every time you switch tasks,
it depletes a little bit.

00:12:13.360 --> 00:12:17.590
And it turns out that
even small decisions

00:12:17.590 --> 00:12:21.470
deplete your stores of glucose
as much as big ones do.

00:12:21.470 --> 00:12:24.590
So if you're trying to decide
which breakfast cereal to buy

00:12:24.590 --> 00:12:28.320
at the store or whether to
use a red pen or a blue pen

00:12:28.320 --> 00:12:32.160
for something, these seemingly
inconsequential decisions

00:12:32.160 --> 00:12:35.740
are still decisions as far as
your neurons are concerned.

00:12:35.740 --> 00:12:38.610
And they're competing
for mental energy

00:12:38.610 --> 00:12:43.270
with important decisions, like
whether to put your pension

00:12:43.270 --> 00:12:45.340
into stocks or bonds,
or how to resolve

00:12:45.340 --> 00:12:47.590
some interpersonal
problem you have.

00:12:48.710 --> 00:12:50.800
They're competing with
trying to remember things,

00:12:50.800 --> 00:12:53.950
like you have to pay
your electric bill

00:12:53.950 --> 00:12:55.880
on a certain day
at a certain time.

00:12:55.880 --> 00:13:00.670
Whatever the decision
is, it's depleting

00:13:00.670 --> 00:13:01.930
these neural resources.

00:13:01.930 --> 00:13:05.090
Kicking into the daydreaming
mode is one of the best ways

00:13:05.090 --> 00:13:08.100
that we know of
basically hitting

00:13:08.100 --> 00:13:10.370
the reset button in the brain
and allowing the glucose

00:13:10.370 --> 00:13:11.590
to build up again.

00:13:11.590 --> 00:13:14.670
Taking a nap is another good
way, as is taking a vacation.

00:13:14.670 --> 00:13:16.940
Vacations are very
important, it turns out.

00:13:16.940 --> 00:13:19.190
When I'm talking about
taking breaks and vacations,

00:13:19.190 --> 00:13:21.398
I'm not talking about, oh,
I'm going to stop working.

00:13:21.398 --> 00:13:24.510
I'm going to do email, or I'm
going to watch television.

00:13:24.510 --> 00:13:26.170
Those are not breaks.

00:13:26.170 --> 00:13:27.740
I mean a real break.

00:13:27.740 --> 00:13:29.770
The most restorative
kinds of breaks

00:13:29.770 --> 00:13:32.210
are things where your
mind can really wander.

00:13:32.210 --> 00:13:34.040
And each of us has
a different way

00:13:34.040 --> 00:13:36.140
that we can kick
start that process.

00:13:36.140 --> 00:13:38.120
It might be exercise.

00:13:38.120 --> 00:13:41.570
It might be walking in nature
or a walk around the block.

00:13:41.570 --> 00:13:44.440
It turns out there are
evolutionary reasons why

00:13:44.440 --> 00:13:46.870
exposing yourself
to nature enables

00:13:46.870 --> 00:13:49.400
you to hit the reset button,
being around natural things

00:13:49.400 --> 00:13:52.760
like trees, water,
bodies of water,

00:13:52.760 --> 00:13:55.870
mountains, flowers, and shrubs.

00:13:55.870 --> 00:13:57.645
That's a very
restorative environment.

00:13:59.110 --> 00:14:01.770
I used to work in the
laboratory of Amos Tversky

00:14:01.770 --> 00:14:04.874
here at Stanford who did a lot
of work on decision making.

00:14:04.874 --> 00:14:07.290
And every afternoon, he and
Danny Kahneman, his colleague,

00:14:07.290 --> 00:14:09.970
would take a walk around
the Stanford campus.

00:14:09.970 --> 00:14:11.900
And as Danny
reports in his book,

00:14:11.900 --> 00:14:15.140
"Thinking Fast And Slow,"
most of their greatest ideas

00:14:15.140 --> 00:14:16.280
came from those walks.

00:14:16.280 --> 00:14:17.675
And that's no coincidence.

00:14:19.640 --> 00:14:21.810
This is a restorative
creative act.

00:14:21.810 --> 00:14:23.740
So exercise, taking
walks, taking

00:14:23.740 --> 00:14:25.900
a nap, literature, reading.

00:14:25.900 --> 00:14:31.600
Reading stimulates this
mind-wandering mode

00:14:31.600 --> 00:14:34.270
and helps you to hit
the reset button.

00:14:35.510 --> 00:14:39.960
The pull that we feel against
all this, this very natural

00:14:39.960 --> 00:14:42.320
thing that we feel as if
there's so much going on

00:14:42.320 --> 00:14:44.830
and we're asked to do so
much more now than ever

00:14:44.830 --> 00:14:48.060
before, that we feel as though
if we stop our work for just

00:14:48.060 --> 00:14:50.840
five minutes, we're
going to fall behind.

00:14:50.840 --> 00:14:53.360
You already have 300 unread
emails in your inbox,

00:14:53.360 --> 00:14:55.690
so how can you take
five minutes off?

00:14:55.690 --> 00:14:58.100
But the productivities
are very clear on this.

00:14:58.100 --> 00:15:00.890
If you take off those five
minutes, at the end of the day,

00:15:00.890 --> 00:15:02.480
you get back more than that.

00:15:02.480 --> 00:15:04.300
And overtime is even worse.

00:15:04.300 --> 00:15:07.490
In a number of studies,
people who work 60-hour weeks

00:15:07.490 --> 00:15:11.240
don't get an extra 20 over their
40 hour a week counterparts.

00:15:11.240 --> 00:15:14.616
They end up getting only seven
hours of extra work done.

00:15:14.616 --> 00:15:16.240
So you're putting in
three hours to get

00:15:16.240 --> 00:15:20.220
one hour of work done,
according to the research.

00:15:20.220 --> 00:15:22.450
Not in every profession,
not in every case.

00:15:22.450 --> 00:15:24.090
This is on average.

00:15:24.090 --> 00:15:26.250
And you can certainly
think of counter-examples.

00:15:26.250 --> 00:15:30.610
If there's a crisis-- look at
the Ebola workers in Liberia,

00:15:30.610 --> 00:15:33.960
or if there's an
earthquake, rescue workers.

00:15:33.960 --> 00:15:36.780
Of course, getting
those seven hours

00:15:36.780 --> 00:15:38.350
is worth them putting in 20.

00:15:38.350 --> 00:15:40.410
But in daily life,
in your daily work,

00:15:40.410 --> 00:15:42.700
if it's not an
emergency situation,

00:15:42.700 --> 00:15:44.060
it's worth looking at.

00:15:44.060 --> 00:15:45.830
Am I willing to put
in 20 to get seven?

00:15:45.830 --> 00:15:48.270
It may not be the best use
of your time or the company's

00:15:48.270 --> 00:15:48.770
time.

00:15:49.750 --> 00:15:51.420
So what can we do about this?

00:15:51.420 --> 00:15:55.500
How can we create this kind of
focus that I'm talking about?

00:15:55.500 --> 00:15:58.680
One thing that
experts do is they

00:15:58.680 --> 00:16:01.600
enforce productivity hours.

00:16:01.600 --> 00:16:05.201
They'll set aside a certain
time of day or several times

00:16:05.201 --> 00:16:07.450
during the day when they
don't want to be interrupted.

00:16:07.450 --> 00:16:09.150
And they turn off
their email program.

00:16:10.470 --> 00:16:12.960
They might even turn
off their phone.

00:16:12.960 --> 00:16:16.330
And they allow
themselves to enter

00:16:16.330 --> 00:16:19.081
a state of undistracted,
sustained concentration.

00:16:19.081 --> 00:16:21.080
And I think you'll agree
that most of the things

00:16:21.080 --> 00:16:24.080
that we care about, whether at
work or at home, whether it's

00:16:24.080 --> 00:16:28.524
time with family or time
on a much-loved hobby,

00:16:28.524 --> 00:16:30.940
they're more enjoyable when
you're fully immersed in them,

00:16:30.940 --> 00:16:33.430
not when you're trying to
do five things at once.

00:16:33.430 --> 00:16:35.990
So these productivity
hours are very important.

00:16:35.990 --> 00:16:39.140
And people always say, well,
I can't turn off my email.

00:16:39.140 --> 00:16:41.170
Something urgent might come in.

00:16:41.170 --> 00:16:42.950
Well, the answer to
that is, you just

00:16:42.950 --> 00:16:46.450
open up another account,
a private account,

00:16:46.450 --> 00:16:48.825
and you give that address
only to those people who

00:16:48.825 --> 00:16:49.950
need to reach you urgently.

00:16:51.070 --> 00:16:54.337
A number of successful and
productive people do this.

00:16:54.337 --> 00:16:56.670
They might give the address
only to eight or 10 people--

00:16:56.670 --> 00:16:59.030
maybe a boss, somebody
who works for them,

00:16:59.030 --> 00:17:01.450
a couple of coworkers,
immediate family members.

00:17:01.450 --> 00:17:03.140
And you can instruct
those people,

00:17:03.140 --> 00:17:04.880
only use this address
if it's urgent.

00:17:04.880 --> 00:17:06.755
If you're sending me a
video of a cat playing

00:17:06.755 --> 00:17:09.510
the piano or an invitation to
a party that's a month away,

00:17:09.510 --> 00:17:11.550
use my regular address.

00:17:11.550 --> 00:17:14.420
Because that account is going to
be turned off most of the day.

00:17:14.420 --> 00:17:16.700
This is the one where I
can be reached urgently.

00:17:16.700 --> 00:17:19.390
This kind of partitioning is
what highly successful people

00:17:19.390 --> 00:17:20.520
do.

00:17:20.520 --> 00:17:25.470
I interviewed a number of
CEOs and successful artists,

00:17:25.470 --> 00:17:29.390
musicians, Nobel Prize winners,
scientists, military leaders,

00:17:29.390 --> 00:17:30.890
and government
leaders for the book.

00:17:30.890 --> 00:17:34.110
And one of the things that
was a thread through all

00:17:34.110 --> 00:17:37.650
of this in trying to
understand their productivity

00:17:37.650 --> 00:17:39.950
is they really partition
things like that.

00:17:39.950 --> 00:17:42.530
And I think I find
the idea refreshing.

00:17:42.530 --> 00:17:46.380
Because if you're like me, for
a lot of your working adult

00:17:46.380 --> 00:17:48.040
life, when you've
been at home, you've

00:17:48.040 --> 00:17:49.689
probably been
thinking about work.

00:17:49.689 --> 00:17:52.230
And when you're at work, you're
probably thinking about home.

00:17:52.230 --> 00:17:55.760
And you find that you're not
really in either place fully.

00:17:55.760 --> 00:17:57.020
And that's no way to live.

00:17:57.020 --> 00:18:00.090
It's better to be fully in
one activity or the other.

00:18:00.090 --> 00:18:04.480
So those are some of the tips
for avoiding distraction.

00:18:04.480 --> 00:18:08.690
Now, I talked about-- and I'll
come back to this in a minute.

00:18:08.690 --> 00:18:12.700
I want to shift and talk
about brain extenders.

00:18:12.700 --> 00:18:14.300
This is a very simple idea.

00:18:14.300 --> 00:18:15.940
The idea is that
if you want to be

00:18:15.940 --> 00:18:18.462
more productive and creative,
don't load up your brain

00:18:18.462 --> 00:18:20.170
with stuff that doesn't
need to be there.

00:18:23.027 --> 00:18:25.110
A great example is, you
hear on the weather report

00:18:25.110 --> 00:18:27.200
that it's going
to rain tomorrow.

00:18:27.200 --> 00:18:29.410
Why stick in your
head, oh, I've got

00:18:29.410 --> 00:18:31.330
to remember to bring
an umbrella, which

00:18:31.330 --> 00:18:34.230
is going to take up
neural resources?

00:18:34.230 --> 00:18:36.080
Put that information
in the environment.

00:18:36.080 --> 00:18:39.080
Go to the closet, get your
umbrella, put it by the door,

00:18:39.080 --> 00:18:42.330
and then it will remind you
to take it when it's time.

00:18:42.330 --> 00:18:44.530
If you're the kind of
person that loses your keys,

00:18:44.530 --> 00:18:47.380
get a key hook and put it by the
front door or a decorative bowl

00:18:47.380 --> 00:18:49.460
on a console table
by the front door.

00:18:49.460 --> 00:18:51.210
If the keys always
go there, you don't

00:18:51.210 --> 00:18:53.410
have to think about
where they are.

00:18:53.410 --> 00:18:55.050
Another example
of brain extenders

00:18:55.050 --> 00:18:56.815
are doors in office buildings.

00:18:58.670 --> 00:19:00.320
Why should you have
to remember how

00:19:00.320 --> 00:19:02.665
every individual door in
your life opens and closes?

00:19:04.070 --> 00:19:07.670
In big buildings,
usually this information

00:19:07.670 --> 00:19:09.040
is offloaded to the environment.

00:19:09.040 --> 00:19:11.980
If the door has a big
horizontal bar across it,

00:19:11.980 --> 00:19:14.900
you know you have to push it and
the door is going to open out,

00:19:14.900 --> 00:19:17.360
and if it has a
U-shaped handle on it,

00:19:17.360 --> 00:19:19.260
you know you're
supposed to pull it,

00:19:19.260 --> 00:19:21.480
and that the door
is going to open in.

00:19:21.480 --> 00:19:23.710
You don't have to remember
this or keep track of it.

00:19:23.710 --> 00:19:26.500
The psychologist JJ Gibson
called these affordances.

00:19:26.500 --> 00:19:30.330
They afford the way in which
they're supposed to be used.

00:19:30.330 --> 00:19:33.860
You HCI people know
this term, I'm sure.

00:19:33.860 --> 00:19:36.290
And we can do that
in all different ways

00:19:36.290 --> 00:19:38.550
in our environment
to externalize.

00:19:38.550 --> 00:19:40.420
The other thing we
do to externalize

00:19:40.420 --> 00:19:42.100
is we write things down.

00:19:42.100 --> 00:19:44.610
As soon as you put
something on paper,

00:19:44.610 --> 00:19:47.076
your brain no longer
needs to keep track of it.

00:19:47.076 --> 00:19:49.700
And paper is actually better for
remembering things and putting

00:19:49.700 --> 00:19:51.430
it than typing it.

00:19:51.430 --> 00:19:53.410
Because of the neural
circuitry involved

00:19:53.410 --> 00:19:55.480
in writing something
longhand, you

00:19:55.480 --> 00:19:58.160
end up processing the
information more deeply.

00:19:58.160 --> 00:20:03.100
So writing it down in many cases
is better than typing it down.

00:20:03.100 --> 00:20:08.520
Now, Google has, of course, been
the de facto information source

00:20:08.520 --> 00:20:11.850
for the last number of
years, replacing long trips

00:20:11.850 --> 00:20:16.010
to the library, combing through
irrelevant pages in dusty books

00:20:16.010 --> 00:20:18.370
to find the one fact that
you were looking for.

00:20:19.440 --> 00:20:21.760
As my colleague
Christopher Chabris says,

00:20:21.760 --> 00:20:25.810
we've outsourced to Google
a massive volume of research

00:20:25.810 --> 00:20:28.930
chores that used to take
anywhere from minutes

00:20:28.930 --> 00:20:32.290
to months of trawling
through reference sources,

00:20:32.290 --> 00:20:34.815
making phone calls,
and visiting archives.

00:20:35.910 --> 00:20:37.790
Our searches are in
order of magnitude

00:20:37.790 --> 00:20:41.130
more efficient and less time
consuming than 20 years ago.

00:20:41.130 --> 00:20:43.300
And this is an example
of externalization.

00:20:43.300 --> 00:20:47.440
We no longer need to carry
around facts like, in 1492,

00:20:47.440 --> 00:20:50.060
Columbus sailed the
ocean blue, or the sun is

00:20:50.060 --> 00:20:53.220
93 million miles away, or
what the time difference is

00:20:53.220 --> 00:20:54.670
between here and Mumbai.

00:20:54.670 --> 00:20:58.510
We can get it in half
a second on an object

00:20:58.510 --> 00:21:01.600
we hold in our hands that
has more processing power

00:21:01.600 --> 00:21:03.700
than Apollo Mission Control had.

00:21:03.700 --> 00:21:07.340
So this is a great example
of a brain extender.

00:21:07.340 --> 00:21:10.560
And I think that it's
a very important way

00:21:10.560 --> 00:21:12.630
that we can become more
productive and efficient.

00:21:12.630 --> 00:21:14.740
Don't keep up here things
that don't need to be up here.

00:21:14.740 --> 00:21:17.070
And you understand this, I
think, better than anyone.

00:21:20.950 --> 00:21:25.010
The last thing I wanted to
talk about is decision making.

00:21:27.700 --> 00:21:33.790
With all of this information
at our fingertips,

00:21:33.790 --> 00:21:35.490
we have the power
to make decisions

00:21:35.490 --> 00:21:37.250
that we couldn't make before.

00:21:37.250 --> 00:21:39.482
And a good example of that
is in the medical domain.

00:21:39.482 --> 00:21:41.440
It used to be that you
just went to the doctor,

00:21:41.440 --> 00:21:43.340
and you did whatever
the doctor told you.

00:21:43.340 --> 00:21:45.280
But now there's all
kinds of information

00:21:45.280 --> 00:21:47.344
available through
the internet that

00:21:47.344 --> 00:21:49.010
can help you to make
an informed choice.

00:21:50.060 --> 00:21:53.470
There's so much more
information now than before.

00:21:53.470 --> 00:21:56.340
By some estimates, the amount
of scientific information

00:21:56.340 --> 00:21:59.330
in the world in
the last 20 years

00:21:59.330 --> 00:22:02.540
equals all of the scientific
information generated up

00:22:02.540 --> 00:22:03.790
to that point in history.

00:22:04.940 --> 00:22:06.730
So we've doubled
scientific information

00:22:06.730 --> 00:22:08.410
20 years by some estimates.

00:22:08.410 --> 00:22:11.860
And there's enormous
amounts of medical data.

00:22:11.860 --> 00:22:15.350
It turns out that for some of
the most difficult decisions

00:22:15.350 --> 00:22:18.470
we make in medicine,
whether to get a treatment

00:22:18.470 --> 00:22:21.940
or not, whether to take
a drug or not take it,

00:22:21.940 --> 00:22:25.220
whether to have surgery or
radiation treatment if you've

00:22:25.220 --> 00:22:28.290
got cancer, these different
kinds of decisions,

00:22:28.290 --> 00:22:31.910
doctors aren't
schooled in a lot of

00:22:31.910 --> 00:22:35.119
the decision-making processes
that need to be applied here.

00:22:35.119 --> 00:22:36.535
It's not part of
their curriculum.

00:22:37.980 --> 00:22:40.280
They don't always know how
to acquire the information.

00:22:40.280 --> 00:22:42.880
And once they do, they don't
know how to analyze it.

00:22:42.880 --> 00:22:44.990
And I think we're
in an age where

00:22:44.990 --> 00:22:48.010
it's becoming increasingly
apparent that we all

00:22:48.010 --> 00:22:50.710
need to take control of our
own medical decision making,

00:22:50.710 --> 00:22:52.820
and we need to become
proactive and responsible.

00:22:54.740 --> 00:22:58.010
And the information
age has allowed that.

00:22:58.010 --> 00:23:01.490
Of course, the difficult thing
is separating the digital wheat

00:23:01.490 --> 00:23:03.950
from the digital chaff,
trying to figure out

00:23:03.950 --> 00:23:06.540
what is good information
and what is not.

00:23:06.540 --> 00:23:09.550
So one of the things
I think we need to do

00:23:09.550 --> 00:23:12.630
is start teaching our
children right away

00:23:12.630 --> 00:23:13.890
information literacy.

00:23:13.890 --> 00:23:18.740
I think the primary mission
of education has to shift.

00:23:18.740 --> 00:23:21.840
It used to be trying to teach
children a bunch of facts.

00:23:21.840 --> 00:23:23.090
Now they can get the facts.

00:23:23.090 --> 00:23:25.240
I think what we have to
do is start teaching them

00:23:25.240 --> 00:23:28.420
how to use those facts,
to use them intelligently

00:23:28.420 --> 00:23:32.080
and creatively in order to help
solve the world's problems.

00:23:32.080 --> 00:23:36.750
So to go back to the medical
case, if you're looking up

00:23:36.750 --> 00:23:39.320
a particular prescription
drug and trying to figure out

00:23:39.320 --> 00:23:41.310
whether you want
to take it or not,

00:23:41.310 --> 00:23:43.670
the first thing that's part
of information literacy

00:23:43.670 --> 00:23:45.211
that every eight-year-old
should know

00:23:45.211 --> 00:23:46.890
is, who's website are you on?

00:23:46.890 --> 00:23:48.140
Is it the drug manufacturer's?

00:23:49.360 --> 00:23:51.660
Might there be biased
information on there?

00:23:51.660 --> 00:23:53.840
Is it the site for
the manufacturer

00:23:53.840 --> 00:23:55.320
of a competing drug?

00:23:55.320 --> 00:23:57.950
Maybe it's some sort of shadow
site for the manufacturer

00:23:57.950 --> 00:24:01.850
of a competing
drug under the name

00:24:01.850 --> 00:24:05.180
Americansforbetterhealthcare.com
or something like that.

00:24:05.180 --> 00:24:08.296
And it's really a shill
for another drug company.

00:24:08.296 --> 00:24:10.170
These are questions that
are important to ask

00:24:10.170 --> 00:24:11.820
so that you can be informed.

00:24:11.820 --> 00:24:15.990
And why is that I'm
making such a big deal out

00:24:15.990 --> 00:24:17.070
of medical decisions?

00:24:17.070 --> 00:24:21.970
Well, I walk through several
examples in the book.

00:24:21.970 --> 00:24:23.180
I'll give you one.

00:24:23.180 --> 00:24:25.430
Suppose you go to your
doctor, and your doctor

00:24:25.430 --> 00:24:27.850
says that your
cholesterol is high,

00:24:27.850 --> 00:24:30.390
and that she wants to
start you on statens.

00:24:30.390 --> 00:24:31.599
You've heard of statens.

00:24:31.599 --> 00:24:33.640
You know that they're
cholesterol-lowering drugs.

00:24:33.640 --> 00:24:35.690
And so you think, sure, why not?

00:24:35.690 --> 00:24:36.690
Sounds like a good idea.

00:24:36.690 --> 00:24:38.480
I'd like to have
lower cholesterol.

00:24:38.480 --> 00:24:41.290
Well, the first
question you should ask

00:24:41.290 --> 00:24:43.610
is what is the number
needed to treat.

00:24:44.720 --> 00:24:46.620
This is a little-known
statistic that doctors

00:24:46.620 --> 00:24:49.040
don't like talking about
and pharmaceutical companies

00:24:49.040 --> 00:24:50.510
like even less.

00:24:50.510 --> 00:24:54.510
It's the number of patients
that have to take a drug for it

00:24:54.510 --> 00:24:56.380
to be effective on one patient.

00:24:57.187 --> 00:24:59.270
Now, you're probably
thinking, well, that's crazy.

00:24:59.270 --> 00:25:00.440
The number should be one.

00:25:00.440 --> 00:25:02.690
Why would my doctor be
giving me a medication

00:25:02.690 --> 00:25:04.180
that's not going to help me?

00:25:04.180 --> 00:25:06.040
But it doesn't actually
work out that way,

00:25:06.040 --> 00:25:07.650
because there are a
lot of medications

00:25:07.650 --> 00:25:09.140
that don't work on everybody.

00:25:09.140 --> 00:25:12.200
In fact, most don't
work on everybody.

00:25:12.200 --> 00:25:15.750
I can only think of
one or two medications

00:25:15.750 --> 00:25:17.710
where the number
needed to treat is one,

00:25:17.710 --> 00:25:20.610
and they're for rare cancers
only a few hundred people

00:25:20.610 --> 00:25:21.620
a year get.

00:25:21.620 --> 00:25:24.751
For most of us, the drugs aren't
going to work on everybody.

00:25:24.751 --> 00:25:26.000
Think about this for a minute.

00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:27.541
What do you suppose
the number needed

00:25:27.541 --> 00:25:30.340
to treat for one of the
more popular statens is?

00:25:30.340 --> 00:25:34.090
How many people need to take it
before one person gets cured?

00:25:36.160 --> 00:25:39.110
For the one I'm thinking about--
and which Penguin's lawyers

00:25:39.110 --> 00:25:43.190
said I'm not allowed to say out
loud-- for the one I'm thinking

00:25:43.190 --> 00:25:47.450
of, the number needed
to treat is 300.

00:25:47.450 --> 00:25:49.720
And I didn't just pull
this out to shock you.

00:25:49.720 --> 00:25:52.050
This is a typical
number needed to treat

00:25:52.050 --> 00:25:54.030
for pharmaceutical products.

00:25:54.030 --> 00:25:57.466
300 people take the drug,
one person gets better.

00:25:57.466 --> 00:25:58.840
So now you're
thinking, well, OK,

00:25:58.840 --> 00:26:00.720
I don't want to have
high cholesterol.

00:26:00.720 --> 00:26:03.250
Sure, I'm willing to
take the chance of being

00:26:03.250 --> 00:26:06.150
the one in 300 that'll
help, because I'm

00:26:06.150 --> 00:26:09.369
helping to reduce the chance
of my getting a heart attack.

00:26:09.369 --> 00:26:10.910
But then the next
question you should

00:26:10.910 --> 00:26:12.850
ask your doctor is,
well, wait a minute,

00:26:12.850 --> 00:26:15.520
what are the chances of
side effects for this drug,

00:26:15.520 --> 00:26:16.947
and what are they?

00:26:16.947 --> 00:26:18.530
Well, for the drug
I'm thinking about,

00:26:18.530 --> 00:26:21.880
one of the most popular
cholesterol-lowering drugs,

00:26:21.880 --> 00:26:25.440
the side effects occur in about
5% of the people who take it.

00:26:25.440 --> 00:26:29.530
And the side effects include
severe and debilitating muscle

00:26:29.530 --> 00:26:34.000
and joint pain, gastrointestinal
distress, diarrhea,

00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:37.650
blood in the stool, blood in
the urine, headaches, nausea,

00:26:37.650 --> 00:26:38.265
and dizziness.

00:26:39.470 --> 00:26:41.080
These are awful.

00:26:41.080 --> 00:26:42.430
5% of the people are getting it.

00:26:42.430 --> 00:26:46.180
Well, that's not a lot if
we take five out of 100.

00:26:46.180 --> 00:26:49.340
But if we take the 300
that we're talking about,

00:26:49.340 --> 00:26:51.650
that means 15 people are
going to have the side

00:26:51.650 --> 00:26:54.380
effects for every one
person who's helped.

00:26:54.380 --> 00:26:57.030
You're 15 times more likely
to experience the side effect

00:26:57.030 --> 00:26:58.220
than the cure.

00:26:58.220 --> 00:27:00.519
So now the calculation becomes
a little different about

00:27:00.519 --> 00:27:02.310
whether you want to
take this thing or not.

00:27:02.310 --> 00:27:04.290
This is the kind of
information literacy

00:27:04.290 --> 00:27:07.930
and decision-making literacy
that I lay out in the book

00:27:07.930 --> 00:27:09.940
and I think we
should be teaching

00:27:09.940 --> 00:27:12.430
beginning at
eight-year-olds-- some

00:27:12.430 --> 00:27:15.130
of the more nuanced things,
maybe not till high school.

00:27:16.970 --> 00:27:19.670
And it involves things that
some of you engineers know,

00:27:19.670 --> 00:27:23.510
Bayesian inferencing, updating
your estimates of probabilities

00:27:23.510 --> 00:27:25.055
with new information.

00:27:25.055 --> 00:27:27.420
But I think this
is very important.

00:27:27.420 --> 00:27:31.200
And I think that-- getting back
to the idea of what we should

00:27:31.200 --> 00:27:34.830
teach our children, not to
put too fine a point on it,

00:27:34.830 --> 00:27:38.390
but they're going to encounter
the facts on their own.

00:27:38.390 --> 00:27:41.110
They already know how
to find out information.

00:27:41.110 --> 00:27:43.820
What they're not getting
trained in adequately, I think,

00:27:43.820 --> 00:27:47.380
is how to evaluate those
sources of information

00:27:47.380 --> 00:27:50.610
and how to use them
creatively and intelligently.

00:27:50.610 --> 00:27:53.060
And I think solving the
biggest problems in the world

00:27:53.060 --> 00:27:56.630
will require a combination
of that-- knowing how

00:27:56.630 --> 00:28:00.110
to use information-- and having
adequate opportunities to let

00:28:00.110 --> 00:28:02.350
the daydreaming or
creative mode kick in.

00:28:03.820 --> 00:28:04.410
Let's face it.

00:28:04.410 --> 00:28:05.826
The biggest problems
we're looking

00:28:05.826 --> 00:28:09.070
at in the world right now--
aggression across borders

00:28:09.070 --> 00:28:14.440
and within countries, poverty,
unequal distribution of wealth,

00:28:14.440 --> 00:28:19.920
climate change-- if the problems
had simple, linear solutions,

00:28:19.920 --> 00:28:22.394
somebody would have
figured them out already.

00:28:22.394 --> 00:28:23.810
It's more likely
that they'll come

00:28:23.810 --> 00:28:26.430
from people who were thinking
outside the box, as we say,

00:28:26.430 --> 00:28:27.850
thinking creatively.

00:28:27.850 --> 00:28:29.920
And for that to
happen, it's not going

00:28:29.920 --> 00:28:31.900
to happen while you're
doing 10 things at once

00:28:31.900 --> 00:28:34.430
and giving five seconds
of attention to each one.

00:28:34.430 --> 00:28:37.970
It's going to happen when
you have a sustained period

00:28:37.970 --> 00:28:39.280
to deal with them.

00:28:39.280 --> 00:28:42.140
Now, when I talk
about being organized,

00:28:42.140 --> 00:28:44.480
I don't want there to
be a misunderstanding.

00:28:44.480 --> 00:28:48.140
I'm not talking about all
of us being like Mr. Spock,

00:28:48.140 --> 00:28:52.380
and being completely
regimented, and unemotional,

00:28:52.380 --> 00:28:53.860
and logical all the time.

00:28:53.860 --> 00:28:59.400
What I'm talking about is being
able to bring more efficiency

00:28:59.400 --> 00:29:01.320
to the workday so that
at the end of the day,

00:29:01.320 --> 00:29:04.970
you close the door on it and
have more time for spontaneity,

00:29:04.970 --> 00:29:10.430
for creativity, for time
with loved ones, and for fun.

00:29:10.430 --> 00:29:13.400
I'm talking about being able to
introduce those elements more

00:29:13.400 --> 00:29:15.450
regular in your life,
because you're not

00:29:15.450 --> 00:29:17.140
feeling like you're
always behind,

00:29:17.140 --> 00:29:18.967
that you're able to
make the most out

00:29:18.967 --> 00:29:20.550
of every minute and
every opportunity.

00:29:22.590 --> 00:29:24.030
So that's all I had to say.

00:29:24.030 --> 00:29:25.410
I'd be happy to take questions.

00:29:25.410 --> 00:29:28.340
And above all, I'm
grateful to all of you

00:29:28.340 --> 00:29:30.620
for spending this
afternoon with me.

00:29:30.620 --> 00:29:31.770
Thank you very much.

00:29:31.770 --> 00:29:34.170
[APPLAUSE]

00:29:36.570 --> 00:29:37.405
AUDIENCE: Hi, yeah.

00:29:39.070 --> 00:29:42.016
One of the things you
touched on is the rapidity

00:29:42.016 --> 00:29:43.390
with which you
can make decisions

00:29:43.390 --> 00:29:46.220
and how quickly you can do your
thing, your work, and so on.

00:29:46.220 --> 00:29:48.576
And yet, one of the
things that Google does

00:29:48.576 --> 00:29:50.450
is it tries to minimize
the amount of time it

00:29:50.450 --> 00:29:51.710
takes to get a response.

00:29:51.710 --> 00:29:54.880
You type a query, and it's
300 milliseconds or whatever.

00:29:54.880 --> 00:29:57.090
So we encourage a
very rapid iteration,

00:29:57.090 --> 00:30:01.480
a very rapid query
response cycle.

00:30:01.480 --> 00:30:04.300
And yet there's evidence to
suggest that sometimes slowing

00:30:04.300 --> 00:30:09.980
the pace of work down
increases accuracy, increases

00:30:09.980 --> 00:30:11.950
depth of processing, and so on.

00:30:11.950 --> 00:30:15.860
How do you make these sort
of personal evaluations

00:30:15.860 --> 00:30:18.430
in your life and in your
decision-making process?

00:30:22.966 --> 00:30:27.210
DANIEL LEVITIN: I
try to figure out

00:30:27.210 --> 00:30:32.090
whether-- I try to prioritize
my decision making,

00:30:32.090 --> 00:30:34.812
and separate the big ones
from the little ones,

00:30:34.812 --> 00:30:36.520
and deal with the big
ones in the morning

00:30:36.520 --> 00:30:38.490
when my gumption is at a high.

00:30:39.510 --> 00:30:42.125
And then I follow the
advice of David Allen

00:30:42.125 --> 00:30:44.740
and other efficiency
experts-- try

00:30:44.740 --> 00:30:47.617
to figure out what do I need
in order to make this decision,

00:30:47.617 --> 00:30:49.700
in order to push this
forward, especially if one's

00:30:49.700 --> 00:30:51.260
been lingering for awhile.

00:30:51.260 --> 00:30:53.310
Do I need more information?

00:30:53.310 --> 00:30:54.870
If so, where am I
going to get that?

00:30:54.870 --> 00:30:57.240
Can I delegate the acquisition
of that information

00:30:57.240 --> 00:30:58.030
to someone else?

00:30:58.030 --> 00:30:59.335
Is there an expert I can ask?

00:31:00.499 --> 00:31:02.040
Do I need time to
just think it over?

00:31:02.040 --> 00:31:03.456
This is what judges
do, of course.

00:31:03.456 --> 00:31:05.690
They often get all
the information

00:31:05.690 --> 00:31:07.120
and then allow
themselves a couple

00:31:07.120 --> 00:31:09.585
of days to ruminate
about it, especially when

00:31:09.585 --> 00:31:10.710
there are big consequences.

00:31:12.964 --> 00:31:14.880
You've raised another
point about the rapidity

00:31:14.880 --> 00:31:15.505
of information.

00:31:18.980 --> 00:31:21.250
Google has made searches
an order of magnitude

00:31:21.250 --> 00:31:23.480
more efficient than
they used to be.

00:31:23.480 --> 00:31:27.450
And most of the
time-- and especially

00:31:27.450 --> 00:31:29.370
Google Scholar for
somebody in my line of work

00:31:29.370 --> 00:31:30.964
is very helpful--
most of the time,

00:31:30.964 --> 00:31:32.630
you get exactly what
you're looking for.

00:31:32.630 --> 00:31:34.730
And if not, it's
not too far off.

00:31:34.730 --> 00:31:38.670
But I was thinking the
other day about how--

00:31:38.670 --> 00:31:40.375
I wrote a lot of this
book in libraries.

00:31:42.660 --> 00:31:45.077
And I would be walking
to a shelf to get a book,

00:31:45.077 --> 00:31:46.660
and something else
would catch my eye.

00:31:48.140 --> 00:31:50.270
And I would start
looking at it, and it

00:31:50.270 --> 00:31:52.270
was something that was
fascinating and wonderful

00:31:52.270 --> 00:31:54.700
that I didn't even know
I was interested in.

00:31:54.700 --> 00:31:57.830
And that would set me off on
some non-linear but wonderful

00:31:57.830 --> 00:31:58.370
path.

00:31:58.370 --> 00:32:00.490
And I was thinking,
what I'd like

00:32:00.490 --> 00:32:03.380
to see in Google-- I'm sure
everybody comes here and tells

00:32:03.380 --> 00:32:05.510
you stuff that you've
already thought of.

00:32:05.510 --> 00:32:09.390
I'd like to see a
serendipity button where,

00:32:09.390 --> 00:32:11.500
when I get my
search results that

00:32:11.500 --> 00:32:14.850
are very accurate
and focused, there's

00:32:14.850 --> 00:32:18.980
a separate column of the near
misses, things that aren't

00:32:18.980 --> 00:32:21.460
exactly the right one, but
they're sort of related,

00:32:21.460 --> 00:32:24.440
the kinds of things I might have
found if I was walking around

00:32:24.440 --> 00:32:29.180
in a bookstore or library
on the shelf next to it.

00:32:29.180 --> 00:32:32.097
I would find that
a nice feature.

00:32:32.097 --> 00:32:34.180
Of course, I can use
somebody else's search engine

00:32:34.180 --> 00:32:35.360
and get those automatically.

00:32:35.360 --> 00:32:40.120
[LAUGHTER]

00:32:40.120 --> 00:32:43.470
I mean unintentionally
automatically, just to--

00:32:43.470 --> 00:32:45.220
AUDIENCE: Your tips
are really helpful.

00:32:45.220 --> 00:32:48.060
I was wondering if
there's anything somebody

00:32:48.060 --> 00:32:50.350
with Attention
Deficit Disorder can

00:32:50.350 --> 00:32:53.090
do to improve and organize
their lives better?

00:32:53.090 --> 00:32:54.840
DANIEL LEVITIN: Attention
Deficit Disorder

00:32:54.840 --> 00:32:57.260
is an interesting phenomenon.

00:32:57.260 --> 00:32:58.395
It really does exist.

00:33:00.220 --> 00:33:03.200
Many people with
Attention Deficit Disorder

00:33:03.200 --> 00:33:08.380
are able to be especially
creative because of the way

00:33:08.380 --> 00:33:12.460
their mind works going from one
unrelated thought to another.

00:33:12.460 --> 00:33:16.330
One of the difficulties, of
course, is that people with ADD

00:33:16.330 --> 00:33:19.730
tend to start a lot of projects
and not finish any of them.

00:33:19.730 --> 00:33:24.570
So I think the greatest thing
is when somebody with ADD

00:33:24.570 --> 00:33:27.860
is paired with somebody
in the workplace who

00:33:27.860 --> 00:33:31.100
may not have a desire to
be particularly creative

00:33:31.100 --> 00:33:35.160
and is a real focused, logical,
get-things-done person.

00:33:35.160 --> 00:33:38.440
And working together
as a team, they

00:33:38.440 --> 00:33:40.010
can really accomplish
great things.

00:33:40.010 --> 00:33:42.910
And in fact, some companies
do this implicitly

00:33:42.910 --> 00:33:48.300
without using labels like ADD
or task manager or project

00:33:48.300 --> 00:33:48.800
manager.

00:33:51.030 --> 00:33:52.900
But big companies
sort themselves

00:33:52.900 --> 00:33:55.350
out in this way, especially
when you're putting together

00:33:55.350 --> 00:33:56.490
project teams.

00:33:56.490 --> 00:33:58.520
You're thinking implicitly,
well, this person

00:33:58.520 --> 00:34:02.510
has a lot of great ideas,
this person gets things done.

00:34:02.510 --> 00:34:04.880
And we're not using
the clinical labels,

00:34:04.880 --> 00:34:06.350
but it's the same kind of idea.

00:34:06.350 --> 00:34:08.510
Of course, then there are drugs.

00:34:08.510 --> 00:34:11.090
Ritalin, otherwise known
as methylphenidate,

00:34:11.090 --> 00:34:14.929
can help ADD people to stay
focused, but many report

00:34:14.929 --> 00:34:17.210
that they feel a
loss of creativity.

00:34:17.210 --> 00:34:20.179
So they finally get
things done, but they

00:34:20.179 --> 00:34:23.036
don't feel that they're
doing their best work.

00:34:23.036 --> 00:34:25.239
AUDIENCE: So you
mentioned multitasking

00:34:25.239 --> 00:34:30.880
is bad, and essentially
an illusion.

00:34:32.080 --> 00:34:34.550
And you gave
references to switching

00:34:34.550 --> 00:34:36.100
every five minutes or so.

00:34:36.100 --> 00:34:37.900
Is there data, or
do you have a sense

00:34:37.900 --> 00:34:42.060
of what is the amount of time,
at least, that someone should

00:34:42.060 --> 00:34:44.052
focus on a task and then switch?

00:34:44.052 --> 00:34:46.010
DANIEL LEVITIN: I think
it depends on the task.

00:34:47.111 --> 00:34:48.569
There are some
things that you know

00:34:48.569 --> 00:34:50.429
will only take a minute or two.

00:34:50.429 --> 00:34:52.823
And if you're trying to
create a productive day,

00:34:52.823 --> 00:34:54.489
it's best to group
those all and do them

00:34:54.489 --> 00:34:57.780
all in an hour where you can
do all the little things.

00:34:57.780 --> 00:35:00.980
It might be going through
your emails and sorting them,

00:35:00.980 --> 00:35:03.110
or you might have to
log into a website

00:35:03.110 --> 00:35:06.490
to find out how much you
owe the water company

00:35:06.490 --> 00:35:07.560
and then pay your bill.

00:35:07.560 --> 00:35:12.242
All these little things
that only take two minutes,

00:35:12.242 --> 00:35:13.700
productivity experts
say if there's

00:35:13.700 --> 00:35:15.075
something that
takes two minutes,

00:35:15.075 --> 00:35:18.640
do it right now, not in the
middle of something else.

00:35:18.640 --> 00:35:19.420
Do it today.

00:35:21.070 --> 00:35:22.740
Other tasks that
are going to require

00:35:22.740 --> 00:35:28.080
weeks or months of work, things
with a long event horizon,

00:35:28.080 --> 00:35:31.180
I think you really want to be
able to put in at least an hour

00:35:31.180 --> 00:35:35.170
at a time on the task and maybe
carve out three or four or five

00:35:35.170 --> 00:35:37.570
hours throughout the day
where you're just doing that.

00:35:37.570 --> 00:35:39.380
Maybe up to an hour
and a half or two.

00:35:39.380 --> 00:35:41.790
There are big
individual differences

00:35:41.790 --> 00:35:44.370
among the thousands of ways
that human beings differ

00:35:44.370 --> 00:35:47.520
from one another, big
differences in how long people

00:35:47.520 --> 00:35:48.472
can sustain attention.

00:35:48.472 --> 00:35:50.430
And as you know, it
changes throughout the week

00:35:50.430 --> 00:35:51.554
and throughout the seasons.

00:35:51.554 --> 00:35:55.140
But I think that
for anything we care

00:35:55.140 --> 00:35:59.020
about, you're looking at closer
to an hour than five minutes.

00:36:00.040 --> 00:36:02.500
Although every once in a
while, you surprise yourself.

00:36:02.500 --> 00:36:04.990
Some great songs were
written in 15 minutes.

00:36:04.990 --> 00:36:07.750
AUDIENCE: What about
research into different sorts

00:36:07.750 --> 00:36:10.590
of activities that you can
maybe more successfully do

00:36:10.590 --> 00:36:12.370
at the same time than others?

00:36:12.370 --> 00:36:16.920
For example, I remember at
a company I used to work on,

00:36:16.920 --> 00:36:21.120
we did most of our communication
by conference call.

00:36:21.120 --> 00:36:23.290
So if somebody was typing
or looking at the email,

00:36:23.290 --> 00:36:25.880
you could definitely tell
on the conference call,

00:36:25.880 --> 00:36:28.197
because they would
simply just seem

00:36:28.197 --> 00:36:30.280
to not be able to do both
things at the same time.

00:36:30.280 --> 00:36:31.220
If you ask them to
speak, there would

00:36:31.220 --> 00:36:32.900
be a big pause compared
to the people that

00:36:32.900 --> 00:36:33.983
were really concentrating.

00:36:35.890 --> 00:36:38.089
I remember also
that I often used

00:36:38.089 --> 00:36:40.380
to be at home and doing
something else at the same time

00:36:40.380 --> 00:36:44.302
completely different, like
the washing up or something,

00:36:44.302 --> 00:36:46.510
and seem to be able to do
that much more successfully

00:36:46.510 --> 00:36:48.560
at the same time
as another guy who

00:36:48.560 --> 00:36:51.040
would run during our
conference calls.

00:36:51.040 --> 00:36:54.670
So what research is there
on the type of activity

00:36:54.670 --> 00:36:56.370
that people try and
do at the same time?

00:36:56.370 --> 00:36:59.530
DANIEL LEVITIN: Well,
I think it's worth

00:36:59.530 --> 00:37:02.252
thinking about
what-- I think we all

00:37:02.252 --> 00:37:04.710
have a good intuition about
this-- what parts of your brain

00:37:04.710 --> 00:37:05.370
you're using.

00:37:05.370 --> 00:37:08.180
If you're using the verbal
parts to talk on the phone

00:37:08.180 --> 00:37:10.440
and do email and text
at the same time,

00:37:10.440 --> 00:37:13.044
you're not really
doing them all at once.

00:37:13.044 --> 00:37:15.210
On the other hand, if you're
standing on a treadmill

00:37:15.210 --> 00:37:17.250
and reading, that's
OK, because you're

00:37:17.250 --> 00:37:19.470
using different
parts of your brain

00:37:19.470 --> 00:37:21.800
for keeping the
exercise going than you

00:37:21.800 --> 00:37:23.617
are for reading the article.

00:37:23.617 --> 00:37:25.325
There's an interesting
case with driving.

00:37:27.065 --> 00:37:29.025
Driving actually benefits
from multitasking

00:37:29.025 --> 00:37:31.340
in a very limited way.

00:37:32.500 --> 00:37:35.370
If you're on a long
drive and you've

00:37:35.370 --> 00:37:37.900
been driving for awhile--
you're a competent, experienced

00:37:37.900 --> 00:37:41.290
driver, and there are
no hazards in the road,

00:37:41.290 --> 00:37:43.970
and it's not a windy road, it's
a straight piece of freeway

00:37:43.970 --> 00:37:47.180
like Highway Five here--
you're going to get bored,

00:37:47.180 --> 00:37:50.711
and your attention is going sag.

00:37:50.711 --> 00:37:51.585
And that's dangerous.

00:37:52.610 --> 00:37:54.380
So listening to
music while you're

00:37:54.380 --> 00:37:58.150
driving, if it's the right
kind of music-- not lullabies,

00:37:58.150 --> 00:38:00.580
but the right kind of
music that will raise

00:38:00.580 --> 00:38:04.230
your physiological
arousal level just a bit--

00:38:04.230 --> 00:38:06.100
will actually make
you a better driver,

00:38:06.100 --> 00:38:08.590
because it's functioning
as a stimulant.

00:38:08.590 --> 00:38:11.950
If the music is too engrossing,
if it's trance music,

00:38:11.950 --> 00:38:13.870
that's pulling you too
far out of the driving.

00:38:13.870 --> 00:38:16.366
So you've got to hit
the happy balance.

00:38:16.366 --> 00:38:18.340
AUDIENCE: This is
actually kind of a follow

00:38:18.340 --> 00:38:19.970
on to the previous question.

00:38:19.970 --> 00:38:24.870
How would you classify learning
activities in the sense

00:38:24.870 --> 00:38:26.950
that-- it seems that
when you're learning,

00:38:26.950 --> 00:38:29.240
especially when you're
learning a physical task,

00:38:29.240 --> 00:38:31.590
there are aspects of it
that you do automatically,

00:38:31.590 --> 00:38:34.831
and then you have to focus a
lot of attention on the bit

00:38:34.831 --> 00:38:36.080
that you're not familiar with.

00:38:36.080 --> 00:38:37.746
DANIEL LEVITIN: That's
a great question.

00:38:38.800 --> 00:38:41.450
I know the most about
learning musical instruments

00:38:41.450 --> 00:38:43.920
and musical passages,
but it applies

00:38:43.920 --> 00:38:46.530
to a number of other things--
to athletics, to acting,

00:38:46.530 --> 00:38:51.264
and to other motor
learning kinds of things.

00:38:51.264 --> 00:38:53.305
You're asking about motor
learning in particular.

00:38:58.750 --> 00:39:02.060
It turns out that just
doing the motor movements

00:39:02.060 --> 00:39:04.150
isn't very efficient
or very helpful.

00:39:04.150 --> 00:39:07.790
You have to be conscious and
focused on what you're doing

00:39:07.790 --> 00:39:09.020
and why you're doing it.

00:39:09.020 --> 00:39:12.185
So musicians talk about
deliberate practice.

00:39:13.220 --> 00:39:17.980
Piano teachers talk about,
when you're on the bus,

00:39:17.980 --> 00:39:20.150
be mentally practicing
the piano in your head

00:39:20.150 --> 00:39:22.080
and picturing where
your fingers go.

00:39:22.080 --> 00:39:25.791
And when you sit down, you can't
just let your fingers go there.

00:39:25.791 --> 00:39:27.790
You have to be thinking
about what they're doing

00:39:27.790 --> 00:39:29.560
and how they relate to
the music in your head

00:39:29.560 --> 00:39:30.601
or the music on the page.

00:39:31.750 --> 00:39:34.610
And really, it's
a mental exercise

00:39:34.610 --> 00:39:37.510
as much as a physical
one for the practice time

00:39:37.510 --> 00:39:40.690
to be efficient, and not
to just practice by rote,

00:39:40.690 --> 00:39:42.440
but to practice mindfully.

00:39:43.600 --> 00:39:45.550
AUDIENCE: But I guess
what I was trying

00:39:45.550 --> 00:39:50.380
to ask about is how does
that tie into the notion

00:39:50.380 --> 00:39:52.220
that multitasking
is an illusion?

00:39:53.420 --> 00:39:56.590
DANIEL LEVITIN: Well, here, I
don't see it as multitasking.

00:39:56.590 --> 00:40:00.560
If you're doing it right,
they're completely integrated.

00:40:00.560 --> 00:40:03.935
So the idea of thinking about
what you're doing and doing it,

00:40:03.935 --> 00:40:06.310
and then getting some feedback
about whether you actually

00:40:06.310 --> 00:40:08.060
did what you thought
you were going to do,

00:40:08.060 --> 00:40:10.990
and then maybe changing it to
make some modifications, that's

00:40:10.990 --> 00:40:15.660
all part and parcel of-- when
I'm talking about unitasking,

00:40:15.660 --> 00:40:18.710
I don't mean you can only
have one tiny little kernel

00:40:18.710 --> 00:40:19.990
of thought in your mind.

00:40:19.990 --> 00:40:22.790
I mean that you're focused
on a constellation of ideas

00:40:22.790 --> 00:40:24.195
that surround a single activity.

00:40:26.315 --> 00:40:28.940
AUDIENCE: You mentioned
before that a 15-minute nap

00:40:28.940 --> 00:40:31.460
can make up for
an hour of sleep.

00:40:32.780 --> 00:40:35.380
I was just wondering if you
could explain a little bit more

00:40:35.380 --> 00:40:37.930
how that's physically
possible, and if so, why

00:40:37.930 --> 00:40:40.470
aren't we all just taking two
hours of naps every night?

00:40:41.871 --> 00:40:43.910
DANIEL LEVITIN:
Well, if you sleep

00:40:43.910 --> 00:40:48.700
longer than 15 minutes-- well,
longer than about 25 or 30--

00:40:48.700 --> 00:40:51.810
you enter into deeper
sleep, and it's harder

00:40:51.810 --> 00:40:53.310
to wake up from that.

00:40:53.310 --> 00:40:57.220
So long naps in the middle
of the day are not helpful.

00:40:57.220 --> 00:40:59.040
It's really the
short naps that are.

00:40:59.040 --> 00:41:05.260
What's happening at nighttime
is memory consolidation.

00:41:05.260 --> 00:41:07.840
And we have only a relatively
recent understanding

00:41:07.840 --> 00:41:10.150
of this role for
nighttime sleep.

00:41:10.150 --> 00:41:12.780
And that is that
during your regular

00:41:12.780 --> 00:41:16.630
six or eight or 10-hour
stretch of sleep at night,

00:41:16.630 --> 00:41:20.350
your neurons are going over
the experiences and thoughts

00:41:20.350 --> 00:41:23.220
and activities of the
day and processing them

00:41:23.220 --> 00:41:26.700
in a way that allows them to
get into your long-term memory--

00:41:26.700 --> 00:41:29.680
turning them over, thinking
of links between them,

00:41:29.680 --> 00:41:32.790
connections, and storing them.

00:41:32.790 --> 00:41:38.400
If your sleep is disrupted at
night because you stayed up

00:41:38.400 --> 00:41:41.900
too late or you woke up too many
times or something like that,

00:41:41.900 --> 00:41:45.250
it can disturb the memories
for the previous day

00:41:45.250 --> 00:41:47.055
for up to weeks or
months afterwards.

00:41:48.270 --> 00:41:52.300
Now, if you're working in an
intellectually-demanding job

00:41:52.300 --> 00:41:57.000
and you're putting in
four or five hours of work

00:41:57.000 --> 00:41:59.780
in the morning, say from 8:00
to 1:00 in the afternoon,

00:41:59.780 --> 00:42:02.514
when 1:00 rolls
around, your brain

00:42:02.514 --> 00:42:04.180
has been working
pretty hard, and you've

00:42:04.180 --> 00:42:05.430
taken in a lot of information.

00:42:06.540 --> 00:42:12.960
So being able to enter just
the first stages of sleep

00:42:12.960 --> 00:42:16.030
has the effect of hitting
a neurophysiological reset

00:42:16.030 --> 00:42:16.690
button.

00:42:16.690 --> 00:42:18.410
It relaxes some circuits.

00:42:18.410 --> 00:42:19.900
You make a few
little connections.

00:42:19.900 --> 00:42:24.135
You're preprocessing stuff for
that night's sleep episode.

00:42:25.260 --> 00:42:27.680
And there's a
neurochemical story

00:42:27.680 --> 00:42:30.760
that I could point you to
in a series of articles

00:42:30.760 --> 00:42:32.970
by Matthew Walker
at UC Berkeley.

00:42:34.110 --> 00:42:36.182
AUDIENCE: I have a fun
question about vacation

00:42:36.182 --> 00:42:38.640
if we could go back to that
and start planning my next one.

00:42:41.910 --> 00:42:44.400
Well, I have a couple questions
about your recommendations.

00:42:44.400 --> 00:42:48.280
How much time do you think is
required to take off in order

00:42:48.280 --> 00:42:53.660
to re-energize for getting back
into a heavy episode of work,

00:42:53.660 --> 00:42:55.307
like weeks on end?

00:42:55.307 --> 00:42:57.390
What type of vacation do
you think is recommended?

00:42:58.980 --> 00:43:00.970
You mentioned taking
walks around nature

00:43:00.970 --> 00:43:02.495
and having that
be a good charge.

00:43:02.495 --> 00:43:06.430
Does that have any impact in
longer-term stints somewhere?

00:43:06.430 --> 00:43:11.884
So scaling the small naps and
walks out to days and weeks,

00:43:11.884 --> 00:43:12.675
what's recommended?

00:43:14.067 --> 00:43:16.650
DANIEL LEVITIN: I don't know of
any literature that recommends

00:43:16.650 --> 00:43:19.380
a particular amount of time or
a particular kind of vacation.

00:43:19.380 --> 00:43:20.465
AUDIENCE: I'll write it.

00:43:20.465 --> 00:43:22.839
DANIEL LEVITIN: There may be
a vacation doctor out there.

00:43:25.690 --> 00:43:30.150
I think it's probably the case
that nobody has studied this.

00:43:30.150 --> 00:43:33.485
But if they did, my
guess is that they

00:43:33.485 --> 00:43:36.050
would find there are huge
individual differences

00:43:36.050 --> 00:43:38.850
from person to person and from
time to time in your life.

00:43:38.850 --> 00:43:41.850
I'm sure you've all had the
experience where you just

00:43:41.850 --> 00:43:45.740
felt like you needed a day off,
and other times where you felt

00:43:45.740 --> 00:43:47.950
like you just needed two
weeks or a month off.

00:43:47.950 --> 00:43:49.720
And it has to do
with a lot of factors

00:43:49.720 --> 00:43:51.970
about what's going on in
your life, and in your brain,

00:43:51.970 --> 00:43:54.011
and in your body, and your
health, and nutrition,

00:43:54.011 --> 00:43:54.525
and stress.

00:43:55.830 --> 00:43:58.730
Stressful episodes can take
a very long time to get over.

00:43:58.730 --> 00:43:59.790
Grief can take months.

00:44:01.100 --> 00:44:04.860
If it's just regular
workday stuff

00:44:04.860 --> 00:44:06.360
that you're trying
to get away from,

00:44:06.360 --> 00:44:08.080
a shorter vacation
would suffice.

00:44:08.080 --> 00:44:10.010
And if it's the
loss of a loved one,

00:44:10.010 --> 00:44:12.697
it could take months--
not a vacation,

00:44:12.697 --> 00:44:13.655
but months of recovery.

00:44:14.690 --> 00:44:17.050
AUDIENCE: Actually, I'm
a technical writer here

00:44:17.050 --> 00:44:19.180
at Google, and I've also
been a former librarian.

00:44:20.780 --> 00:44:22.430
Reading your book,
it's interesting.

00:44:22.430 --> 00:44:25.660
A lot of us spend a
lot of time on the web

00:44:25.660 --> 00:44:27.860
to pick out the
design elements that

00:44:27.860 --> 00:44:30.710
appeal to the distracted
mind and a lot that

00:44:30.710 --> 00:44:33.240
appeal to the focused mind.

00:44:33.240 --> 00:44:34.350
Can you comment on that?

00:44:34.350 --> 00:44:37.280
Because you spend a
lot of time on the web.

00:44:38.827 --> 00:44:41.410
DANIEL LEVITIN: These are really
interesting design questions.

00:44:43.510 --> 00:44:45.390
The very first
search engines were

00:44:45.390 --> 00:44:47.590
very cluttered and
headache-inducing.

00:44:48.800 --> 00:44:51.000
And Google is well
known for having

00:44:51.000 --> 00:44:53.170
introduced this spare homepage.

00:44:54.630 --> 00:44:56.970
And I think implicit
in your question

00:44:56.970 --> 00:45:00.080
is that a lot of people
like that sparsity,

00:45:00.080 --> 00:45:01.330
but not everybody does.

00:45:01.330 --> 00:45:04.100
And it doesn't meet the
needs of all different kinds

00:45:04.100 --> 00:45:05.115
of processing styles.

00:45:08.860 --> 00:45:10.880
I imagine that there's
a literature on this

00:45:10.880 --> 00:45:13.520
in the computer-human
interaction design community,

00:45:13.520 --> 00:45:14.790
but I'm not familiar with it.

00:45:16.430 --> 00:45:21.940
I know that for people
who are easily distracted,

00:45:21.940 --> 00:45:26.890
people with attention
deficit problems, having

00:45:26.890 --> 00:45:32.710
that big white space is very
intimidating and not very

00:45:32.710 --> 00:45:33.670
helpful.

00:45:33.670 --> 00:45:36.100
But then having too much
going on would be distracting.

00:45:36.100 --> 00:45:39.090
There's got to be
some balance there.

00:45:41.160 --> 00:45:43.480
One of the tips I give
in the book for people

00:45:43.480 --> 00:45:46.700
who have Attention Deficit
Disorder in terms of filing

00:45:46.700 --> 00:45:50.200
things-- and maybe this
is applicable-- there's

00:45:50.200 --> 00:45:54.830
some research that shows that if
they can file by color instead

00:45:54.830 --> 00:45:59.240
of by words-- the problem with
a lot of people who are easily

00:45:59.240 --> 00:46:00.870
distracted or have
attention deficit

00:46:00.870 --> 00:46:04.120
is, they can't focus
on the words that

00:46:04.120 --> 00:46:08.970
are written on the tab
of a physical file folder

00:46:08.970 --> 00:46:10.850
or the names of files
on the computer.

00:46:12.290 --> 00:46:13.980
So color coding can help.

00:46:13.980 --> 00:46:16.660
Everything related to a
certain project is red.

00:46:16.660 --> 00:46:19.260
Everything related to
another project is green.

00:46:19.260 --> 00:46:21.030
And then spatially
organizing them

00:46:21.030 --> 00:46:24.230
so everything related to the
Penske file is over here,

00:46:24.230 --> 00:46:27.620
and everything related
to the Miller file

00:46:27.620 --> 00:46:31.545
is over here, either on
desktop of the computer

00:46:31.545 --> 00:46:32.875
or on the physical desktop.

00:46:34.290 --> 00:46:38.510
I remember some years ago,
Apple, as part of their OS,

00:46:38.510 --> 00:46:41.840
had introduced
this way of having

00:46:41.840 --> 00:46:43.780
custom icons for the folders.

00:46:43.780 --> 00:46:45.680
The folder didn't have
to look like a folder.

00:46:45.680 --> 00:46:46.864
It could look like anything.

00:46:46.864 --> 00:46:48.280
It could be a
Simpson's character.

00:46:48.280 --> 00:46:50.650
It could be any JPEG or TIFF.

00:46:50.650 --> 00:46:55.010
And some people that I know that
had these kinds of difficulties

00:46:55.010 --> 00:46:57.500
and challenges found
that very helpful,

00:46:57.500 --> 00:46:59.920
because it allowed them to
sort things visually and not

00:46:59.920 --> 00:47:00.955
have to rely on words.

00:47:02.866 --> 00:47:05.930
AUDIENCE: You mentioned
the positive value

00:47:05.930 --> 00:47:10.340
of reading with respect to
recharge and creativity.

00:47:10.340 --> 00:47:14.360
And being an avid and
permanently-addicted reader,

00:47:14.360 --> 00:47:18.190
I'm always looking for some
positive value proposition

00:47:18.190 --> 00:47:22.300
I can sell to my kids, that
an hour of literary fiction

00:47:22.300 --> 00:47:24.880
is more beneficial than
an hour of YouTube.

00:47:24.880 --> 00:47:26.460
And I've found it challenging.

00:47:26.460 --> 00:47:29.119
I wondered if you had any
words of wisdom in that area.

00:47:29.119 --> 00:47:30.660
DANIEL LEVITIN: I
think it comes down

00:47:30.660 --> 00:47:33.040
to what the role
of art in society

00:47:33.040 --> 00:47:35.205
is, how we consider the
role of art in society.

00:47:36.420 --> 00:47:41.400
Art in general, and
literature in particular,

00:47:41.400 --> 00:47:43.940
helps us to
re-contextualize the world,

00:47:43.940 --> 00:47:46.100
to see things from
another perspective,

00:47:46.100 --> 00:47:51.499
to see things from a particular
person's perspective, maybe

00:47:51.499 --> 00:47:53.040
somebody from a
different background,

00:47:53.040 --> 00:47:56.720
a different age, a
different set of worldviews.

00:47:56.720 --> 00:48:01.950
We learn to empathize with other
viewpoints and other people.

00:48:01.950 --> 00:48:07.652
And we learn to see in this
re-contextualization process

00:48:07.652 --> 00:48:09.110
connections between
things where we

00:48:09.110 --> 00:48:11.090
didn't see those
connections before.

00:48:11.090 --> 00:48:15.850
And this can stimulate all
kinds of neural processes

00:48:15.850 --> 00:48:18.940
where we're momentarily
comparing our lives

00:48:18.940 --> 00:48:20.559
to the lives we're
reading about.

00:48:20.559 --> 00:48:22.225
We identify with some
of the characters,

00:48:22.225 --> 00:48:25.070
and we imagine what we would
do in these situations.

00:48:25.070 --> 00:48:30.790
And this is a tremendously
important experience

00:48:30.790 --> 00:48:33.030
for boosting
creativity and empathy

00:48:33.030 --> 00:48:37.270
and understanding of the world.

00:48:37.270 --> 00:48:40.550
And I do think that the role
of art is to do those things.

00:48:40.550 --> 00:48:46.410
I don't think the purpose of art
is to make us better at math,

00:48:46.410 --> 00:48:51.530
or to simply be a way to
fill time between work hours

00:48:51.530 --> 00:48:52.470
and sleep.

00:48:52.470 --> 00:48:54.160
I think art is
supposed to challenge

00:48:54.160 --> 00:48:57.950
us to think differently, and
great literature can do that.

00:48:57.950 --> 00:49:00.630
And I mean that about
literary fiction as well as

00:49:00.630 --> 00:49:02.176
literary nonfiction and poetry.

00:49:03.860 --> 00:49:06.550
And that very act of having
your mind wander while you're

00:49:06.550 --> 00:49:09.810
reading is part of
the treasure of it.

00:49:09.810 --> 00:49:12.460
And I think it needs
to be encouraged.

00:49:12.460 --> 00:49:17.610
Now, of course, watching
TV is different,

00:49:17.610 --> 00:49:20.770
or YouTube videos, or
watching moving images

00:49:20.770 --> 00:49:22.670
is different, because
you can't really

00:49:22.670 --> 00:49:24.870
control the pace like you
can when you're reading.

00:49:27.020 --> 00:49:29.920
I guess you could hit the
pause button, but people don't.

00:49:32.330 --> 00:49:34.395
In reading, though,
you can take your time

00:49:34.395 --> 00:49:38.080
and you can go back
over it very easily.

00:49:38.080 --> 00:49:41.670
And I think it's important to
encourage children to do that.

00:49:43.360 --> 00:49:46.420
And again, I think some of
the world's biggest problems

00:49:46.420 --> 00:49:48.190
are more apt to be
solved by people

00:49:48.190 --> 00:49:50.070
who have taken
inspiration from the arts.

00:49:51.230 --> 00:49:54.030
AUDIENCE: Kind of a followup
on the video part of it.

00:49:54.030 --> 00:49:57.870
What I've noticed is that
we tend to classify videos

00:49:57.870 --> 00:50:00.234
as very much like, OK, these
are cat videos, or these

00:50:00.234 --> 00:50:01.900
are distracting, and
so on and so forth.

00:50:01.900 --> 00:50:05.300
But at least in my
mind, when I compare

00:50:05.300 --> 00:50:07.960
my own experience--
say, an hour and a half

00:50:07.960 --> 00:50:11.810
reading some literary fiction
versus reading Twitter,

00:50:11.810 --> 00:50:13.127
there's a world of difference.

00:50:13.127 --> 00:50:15.460
But interestingly, I noticed
there's the same difference

00:50:15.460 --> 00:50:18.150
if I watch a 2-and-1/2 hour
documentary on something,

00:50:18.150 --> 00:50:19.700
like something that
Ken Burns made,

00:50:19.700 --> 00:50:22.202
for example versus
something on YouTube.

00:50:22.202 --> 00:50:23.660
So is there any
data or do you have

00:50:23.660 --> 00:50:27.210
any comment on the
quality of video

00:50:27.210 --> 00:50:29.065
that you can watch
as opposed to--

00:50:29.065 --> 00:50:30.440
DANIEL LEVITIN:
Well, I would put

00:50:30.440 --> 00:50:35.200
Ken Burns in the category
of literary nonfiction.

00:50:35.200 --> 00:50:38.360
His documentaries employ
artistic techniques,

00:50:38.360 --> 00:50:40.234
narrative techniques,
narrative momentum,

00:50:40.234 --> 00:50:41.150
character development.

00:50:42.980 --> 00:50:46.620
So I think they're functioning
in a more artistic capacity.

00:50:48.540 --> 00:50:50.200
Just because they're
nonfiction doesn't

00:50:50.200 --> 00:50:51.950
mean that they're not
artistic, of course.

00:50:51.950 --> 00:50:55.470
AUDIENCE: So my question
is about napping in the day

00:50:55.470 --> 00:50:56.630
and at work.

00:50:59.040 --> 00:51:00.840
I've never tried this.

00:51:00.840 --> 00:51:05.260
And the only time I remember
napping was after having kids,

00:51:05.260 --> 00:51:07.780
when the tiredness
just makes you nap.

00:51:07.780 --> 00:51:09.780
So I'm wondering about
how do you get into this,

00:51:09.780 --> 00:51:12.930
and I'm also wondering about
the comment you made about,

00:51:12.930 --> 00:51:15.710
you have to make sure not
to go into too deep a sleep.

00:51:15.710 --> 00:51:17.222
So you meant set an alarm?

00:51:17.222 --> 00:51:18.180
How does all that work?

00:51:19.610 --> 00:51:21.800
DANIEL LEVITIN: Some
people can more easily

00:51:21.800 --> 00:51:23.000
take naps than others.

00:51:23.000 --> 00:51:24.670
Some people fall
asleep very quickly.

00:51:24.670 --> 00:51:25.630
Some people don't.

00:51:25.630 --> 00:51:27.379
And there are individual
differences here.

00:51:29.650 --> 00:51:32.590
If you're the kind of person
that takes 15 to 30 minutes

00:51:32.590 --> 00:51:36.510
to fall asleep at
night, it's less likely

00:51:36.510 --> 00:51:39.519
that you'll be able to carve
time out of your day at work.

00:51:39.519 --> 00:51:41.560
It's not just like you
can slip into the nap room

00:51:41.560 --> 00:51:43.530
and come out 15 minutes later.

00:51:43.530 --> 00:51:45.860
So knowing that about
yourself is important.

00:51:45.860 --> 00:51:47.320
And maybe instead
of taking naps,

00:51:47.320 --> 00:51:50.816
you'll engage in other
restorative brain activities.

00:51:50.816 --> 00:51:52.940
It might be listening to
music, or reading a novel,

00:51:52.940 --> 00:51:55.940
or taking a walk
around the building,

00:51:55.940 --> 00:52:01.140
looking at art pictures
or something of fine art.

00:52:03.720 --> 00:52:08.977
So to some extent, you're stuck
with your neurogenetic makeup

00:52:08.977 --> 00:52:10.435
in terms of whether
you're somebody

00:52:10.435 --> 00:52:11.570
who falls asleep quickly.

00:52:12.640 --> 00:52:16.970
If you do fall asleep
quickly, a lot of people

00:52:16.970 --> 00:52:18.890
do set alarms
after 15 minutes so

00:52:18.890 --> 00:52:20.590
that they don't enter
that deeper sleep.

00:52:23.920 --> 00:52:25.295
Now, I know there
are exceptions.

00:52:26.549 --> 00:52:28.340
When you're talking
about human physiology,

00:52:28.340 --> 00:52:29.590
there are a lot of exceptions.

00:52:29.590 --> 00:52:32.270
I know somebody who takes
two-hour naps every day.

00:52:32.270 --> 00:52:34.020
Gets a full eight hours
of sleep at night,

00:52:34.020 --> 00:52:35.850
takes two-hour naps
in the afternoon,

00:52:35.850 --> 00:52:37.220
and that works for her.

00:52:38.420 --> 00:52:44.420
But on average, it doesn't
work for the rest of us.

00:52:44.420 --> 00:52:47.420
Because it's putting you in
too deep a sleep mode, and you

00:52:47.420 --> 00:52:48.760
wake up with a mental fog.

00:52:51.890 --> 00:52:54.670
The body also has
these internal clocks

00:52:54.670 --> 00:52:58.090
that expect the same thing
at every time of the day.

00:52:58.090 --> 00:53:01.280
So if you can arrange
your life this way

00:53:01.280 --> 00:53:04.180
that you can try to take a
nap at the same time every day

00:53:04.180 --> 00:53:06.160
and eat your meals at
the same time every day--

00:53:06.160 --> 00:53:07.576
because they work
into the cycle--

00:53:07.576 --> 00:53:09.670
and exercise at
the same time, you

00:53:09.670 --> 00:53:11.180
might find with
a little practice

00:53:11.180 --> 00:53:13.130
after a week or two that
your naps are coming

00:53:13.130 --> 00:53:15.647
more easily, because your
body is conditioned for it.

00:53:15.647 --> 00:53:16.480
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:53:16.480 --> 00:53:18.420
Thank you very much.
