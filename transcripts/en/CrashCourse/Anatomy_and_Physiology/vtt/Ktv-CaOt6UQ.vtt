00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.539
Romeo and Juliet. Helen and Paris. Tristan
and Isolde.

00:00:03.539 --> 00:00:08.149
These famous star-crossed lovers bring to
mind insatiable longing, forbidden love, and

00:00:08.149 --> 00:00:11.609
tragic separation. And poets and emo rockers
love them for it.

00:00:11.609 --> 00:00:13.880
But you know where else you can find a nice
hot romance?

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:14.919
Your muscle cells.

00:00:14.919 --> 00:00:20.799
They’ve got their own famous coupling -- a pretty
pair of tiny protein strands called actin and myosin.

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:24.880
Romeo and Juliet may have set a chain of tragic
events into motion with their infatuation,

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:28.990
but deep down in the cells of your muscles,
the hot protein action between actin and myosin

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:32.870
is actually, literally causing all of
your motions. ALL of them.

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:36.180
And I don’t just mean voluntary stuff, like
walking down the street, or moving your mouth

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:41.400
so you can talk or chew chips. Because your muscles
also support your weight and help fend off gravity.

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:46.080
The amazing thing about your complicated,
self-healing, blood-guzzling muscle tissues

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:50.829
is that they turn chemical potential energy
into mechanical energy, or movement, simply

00:00:50.829 --> 00:00:53.980
by doing two things -- contracting and relaxing.

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:57.970
And that contracting and relaxing is exactly
what’s fueled by the constant coupling and

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:00.430
separation of biology’s greatest lovers.

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:02.510
Somebody get these proteins a movie contract.

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:16.820
You will recall from our early lessons on
tissues that you’re kept alive and moving

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:21.160
by three types of muscle tissue: smooth, cardiac,
and skeletal.

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:25.420
Your smooth muscle tissue is found in the
walls of all your hollow visceral organs,

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:30.520
like your stomach, and airways, and blood
vessels, where it involuntarily and very usefully

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:34.980
pushes fluid and other material around by
contracting and relaxing, over and over.

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:39.220
Your heart is so important that it gets its
very own muscle tissue type -- cardiac muscle,

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:43.720
which looks striped, or striated, and also
functions involuntarily to keep your blood

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:45.570
pumping without you having to think about
it.

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:49.100
But when you hear the word “muscle,” you
probably think of the kind you see on Chris

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:51.939
Evans when he first walks out of that machine
in Captain America.

00:01:51.939 --> 00:01:57.380
And those types -- the ones you can see and
feel and flex -- are your 640 skeletal muscles.

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:01.490
They’re striated like cardiac muscle tissue,
but they’re also mostly voluntary, meaning

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:05.410
you have to think about using them and activate
them with your somatic nervous system. Most of

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:10.310
them attach to your skeleton, and create movement by
pulling bones in different directions as they contract.

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:14.569
Each one of your different skeletal muscles
-- like your biceps brachii, or vastus lateralis

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:19.569
or gluteus maximus -- is technically its own
organ, made up mostly of muscle tissue, but

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:22.510
also of connective tissue, blood vessels,
and nerve fibers.

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:26.730
And because your muscles are voracious energy
hogs, each one is rigged up with its own personal

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:31.290
nerve to stimulate contraction, and its own
artery and vein to keep it well-fed with all

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:33.540
the blood, and oxygen, and nutrients it needs
to operate.

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:37.459
But to understand those operations, we first
need to get a grip on the anatomy of a skeletal

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:40.520
muscle, which involves fibers within fibers,
and lots of layers.

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:44.160
Basically, a skeletal muscle is constructed
like a really sturdy piece of rope.

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:48.819
Thousands of tiny, parallel threads called
myofibrils squish together to form muscle

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:53.190
fibers, which are your actual muscle cells
-- cells with mitochondria, multiple nuclei,

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:55.709
and a cellular membrane called a sarcolemma.

00:02:55.709 --> 00:03:00.160
Those muscle fibers then form larger, string-like
bundles called fascicles, which combine to

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:03.760
form the larger rope-like muscle organ, like
your biceps brachii.

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:08.459
Overall, this bundles-of-bundles configuration
makes muscle tissue fairly sturdy. But considering

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:12.069
how much abuse your muscles take when you
do something like pretty simple, like lift

00:03:12.069 --> 00:03:15.239
a big bag of dog food, it’s no surprise
they need a little help.

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:19.310
That’s why every muscle contains a few different
kinds of supportive sheaths of connective

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:23.580
tissue -- the protective reinforcements to
keep that bulging muscle from bursting.

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:25.690
So that is the structure part of the story.

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:29.630
But if you want to get into the nitty-gritty
-- the down-and-dirty -- of how you actually

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:31.220
move, well, there are rules.

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:34.349
Really, just two main rules, and they have
to do with proteins.

00:03:34.349 --> 00:03:38.209
And they’re both true for a lot of the proteins
we talk about, whether they’re enzymes or

00:03:38.209 --> 00:03:40.849
ion channels or receptors or muscle proteins.

00:03:40.849 --> 00:03:42.409
And these rules are:

00:03:42.409 --> 00:03:46.700
One. Proteins like to change shape when stuff
binds to them. And two. Changing shapes can

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:50.019
allow proteins to bind -- or unbind -- with
other stuff.

00:03:50.019 --> 00:03:54.220
So keep those rules in mind, while we see
how a muscle fiber contracts and relaxes.

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:58.170
Now, remember those tiny myofibrils that bundle
up to form your muscle fibers?

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:02.250
They’re divided lengthwise into segments
called sarcomeres, which contain two even

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:08.720
tinier strands of protein -- two different
kinds of myofilaments called actin and myosin.

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:13.980
And it’s their angsty story of star-crossed love that fuels
every movement your body could possibly dream up.

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:18.939
A sarcomere contains both thin filaments,
made up mostly of two light and twisty actin

00:04:18.939 --> 00:04:24.210
strands, and thick filaments, composed of
thicker, lumpy-looking myosin strands.

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:28.150
Each sarcomere is separated by what’s known
as a Z line at either end, which is just a

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:32.210
border formed by alternating thin filaments
in a kind of zig zag pattern.

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:36.800
A muscle contracting is all about sarcomeres
contracting, bringing those Z-lines closer together.

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:38.569
All right, so now comes the romance.

00:04:38.569 --> 00:04:44.929
When your muscle cells are at rest, your actin &amp; myosin
strands don’t touch, but they really, really want to.

00:04:44.929 --> 00:04:49.800
Specifically, that club-headed myosin wants
to get all up-close-and-personal with the actin.

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:55.280
When this happens -- and it will, eventually -- it’s called
the sliding filament model of muscle contraction.

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:59.440
But in the meantime, like in any good love
story, the pair have some obstacles to overcome.

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:03.920
Namely, actin is blocked by a couple of protein
bodyguards -- called tropomyosin and troponin

00:05:03.929 --> 00:05:05.569
-- which keep getting in the way.

00:05:05.569 --> 00:05:09.709
Luckily, these guards can be bought off
with a little ATP and some calcium.

00:05:09.709 --> 00:05:12.180
I prefer cash and nachos, but whatever.

00:05:12.189 --> 00:05:17.199
Remember, ATP is kind of like molecular currency.
It contains chemical energy, and your muscles

00:05:17.199 --> 00:05:21.659
are all about converting chemical energy to
motion, so they’re always hungry for more ATP.

00:05:21.669 --> 00:05:25.639
Your muscle cells have lots of nuclei, but
some of them also have a lot of mitochondria,

00:05:25.639 --> 00:05:28.369
whose sole purpose in life is to crank out
ATP.

00:05:28.369 --> 00:05:32.369
And muscle cells also have their own version
of an endoplasmic reticulum -- the cell’s

00:05:32.369 --> 00:05:36.669
transport and storage system -- but in this
case it’s specialized, so it gets a special

00:05:36.669 --> 00:05:38.759
name: the sarcoplasmic reticulum.

00:05:38.759 --> 00:05:43.469
Its walls are loaded with calcium pumps -- which
use ATP to save up a bunch of calcium ions.

00:05:43.469 --> 00:05:48.249
And it’s also studded with calcium channels
that are linked to voltage-sensitive proteins

00:05:48.249 --> 00:05:49.930
in the membrane of the muscle cell.

00:05:49.930 --> 00:05:51.129
Say I want to move my arm.

00:05:51.129 --> 00:05:56.340
My brain sends an action potential along the motor
neuron until it synapses with a muscle cell in my arm.

00:05:56.340 --> 00:06:01.139
The receptors on that muscle cell are ligand-gated
sodium channels, so when the motor neuron

00:06:01.139 --> 00:06:05.559
releases our old friend acetylcholine into
the synapse, the channels open up, and create

00:06:05.559 --> 00:06:09.839
a rush of sodium into the cell as a graded
potential, which, if it’s strong enough,

00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:12.740
causes nearby voltage-gated sodium channels
to open.

00:06:12.749 --> 00:06:16.469
Now, I want to take a second and point out
here that we’re still talking about an action

00:06:16.469 --> 00:06:20.610
potential, but not in a neuron. This is happening
in a muscle cell, people.

00:06:20.610 --> 00:06:24.960
So that action potential zips along a muscle
cell’s membrane, the sarcolemma, which has

00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:29.089
lots of tubes that run deep inside the cell,
called T-Tubules.

00:06:29.089 --> 00:06:32.589
When the action potential travels down one
of those tubes, it eventually triggers the

00:06:32.589 --> 00:06:37.660
voltage-sensitive proteins that are linked to those
calcium channels on the cell’s sarcoplasmic reticulum.

00:06:37.660 --> 00:06:42.080
When those channels are thrown open, the calcium
stored inside rushes into the rest of the

00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:45.149
cell, and finally myosin is like, YES! Here
we go!

00:06:45.149 --> 00:06:49.460
At this point, the myosin is totally stoked,
because the bodyguards that have been frustrating

00:06:49.460 --> 00:06:52.179
it are in for a big, irresistible distraction.

00:06:52.179 --> 00:06:56.719
That’s because the protein troponin just
loves to bind with calcium, and remember:

00:06:56.719 --> 00:06:59.389
When stuff binds to proteins, the proteins
change shape.

00:06:59.389 --> 00:07:03.089
So the calcium latches on to the troponin
and causes it to pull the other bodyguard

00:07:03.089 --> 00:07:07.569
protein -- the tropomyosin -- away from the
sites on the actin strands that the myosin

00:07:07.569 --> 00:07:08.990
really wants to get its paws on.

00:07:08.990 --> 00:07:12.120
And suddenly it’s all, “Okay?” “Okay.”

00:07:12.120 --> 00:07:16.820
But the only myosin heads that can bind to those newly
exposed sites are ones that are ready for action.

00:07:16.820 --> 00:07:20.880
That is, the ones that have already grabbed
a molecule of ATP that’s been floating around,

00:07:20.889 --> 00:07:23.680
and broken it down into ADP and the leftover
phosphate.

00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:28.479
When a myosin head does that, it moves into
an extended position, kinda like a stretched

00:07:28.479 --> 00:07:32.969
spring -- still holding on to the ADP and
phosphate, and still storing the energy that

00:07:32.969 --> 00:07:34.949
was released when they were broken apart.

00:07:34.949 --> 00:07:39.110
So after all that, with the myosin primed
for action and the bodyguards out of the way,

00:07:39.110 --> 00:07:42.340
the myosin finally binds to actin, and it
is beautiful.

00:07:42.340 --> 00:07:46.180
When they bind, the myosin releases all that
stored energy, and -- in the excitement of

00:07:46.189 --> 00:07:51.129
it all -- the myosin changes shape. It pulls
on its precious actin strand, kind of like

00:07:51.129 --> 00:07:52.699
pulling a rope hand over fist.

00:07:52.699 --> 00:07:56.909
In the process, it shrinks the whole sarcomere,
and contracts the muscle.

00:07:56.909 --> 00:07:59.689
That’s the sliding part of the sliding filament
model.

00:07:59.689 --> 00:08:04.189
Now, with its energy spent, that little head
has no use for the ADP and the phosphate.

00:08:04.189 --> 00:08:08.169
So they un-bind with it, because -- remember
Rule Number Two, changing shape encourages

00:08:08.169 --> 00:08:12.809
proteins to bind or unbind with stuff. That
unbinding causes a small change in its shape,

00:08:12.809 --> 00:08:15.459
which lets a fresh ATP binds there in its
place.

00:08:15.459 --> 00:08:19.879
That binding causes another shape change.
But this time, it causes the myosin to release

00:08:19.880 --> 00:08:25.680
from the actin, in a tear-jerking scene like some
microscopic re-creation of the finale from Titanic.

00:08:25.680 --> 00:08:28.719
But fear not! This epic is not quite over!

00:08:28.719 --> 00:08:33.779
Because this is when the myosin breaks down
its new molecule of ATP into ADP and a phosphate,

00:08:33.779 --> 00:08:38.110
which moves it into the armed position yet
again, getting it ready for its next rendezvous.

00:08:38.110 --> 00:08:42.599
And meanwhile, those calcium pumps are working
hard to restock the calcium in the sarcoplasmic

00:08:42.599 --> 00:08:47.579
reticulum. So they start grabbing the calcium that’s
floating around, causing calcium to unbind from the

00:08:47.580 --> 00:08:52.200
troponin. When it unbinds, the resulting shape-change
puts the tropomyosin bodyguards back into place.

00:08:52.200 --> 00:08:53.540
It’s a circle.

00:08:53.550 --> 00:08:57.860
Or potentially a big Hollywood franchise.
With lots and lots of sequels.

00:08:57.860 --> 00:09:02.220
It keeps repeating itself many, many times
every moment, while I sit here and talk, and

00:09:02.220 --> 00:09:08.280
while you sit there and eat and text and take notes,
the whole drama replaying itself over and over.

00:09:08.290 --> 00:09:12.579
Kind of like you’ll have to play this video
over and over again to get all the little

00:09:12.579 --> 00:09:14.979
steps of the sliding filament model straightened
out.

00:09:14.980 --> 00:09:17.180
But hey, some stories get better the more
you hear them.

00:09:17.190 --> 00:09:21.709
If you do watch this one again, you will re-learn
that your smooth, cardiac, and skeletal muscles

00:09:21.709 --> 00:09:26.300
create movement by contracting and releasing
in a process called the sliding filament model.

00:09:26.300 --> 00:09:30.490
You’d also re-learn that your skeletal muscles
are constructed like a rope made of bundles

00:09:30.490 --> 00:09:35.550
of protein fibers, and that the smallest strands
are your actin and myosin myofilaments. Its

00:09:35.550 --> 00:09:40.220
their use of calcium and ATP that causes the
binding and unbinding that makes sarcomeres

00:09:40.220 --> 00:09:41.980
contract and relax.
