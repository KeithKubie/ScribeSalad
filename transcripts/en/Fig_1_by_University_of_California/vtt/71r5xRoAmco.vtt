Looking back we were really lucky because
one of the early mountain bikers was a woman named

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:07.690
Wende Cragg.

00:00:07.690 --> 00:00:10.709
Right at the same time as she got into
mountain biking

00:00:10.709 --> 00:00:14.360
she also got into photography and she would go out riding

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:17.390
almost everyday.

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:20.519
so she would bring her camera with her
on these rides and

00:00:20.519 --> 00:00:25.160
take tons and tons of pictures and so
she created

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:28.659
a really impressive archived of early
mountain biking

00:00:28.659 --> 00:00:32.450
the photos in their own right
are really

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:35.470
fascinating and they allow us to tell and

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:39.000
really understand the history better.
I mean the photographs have been crucial

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.100
at times at correcting our
understanding

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:45.550
the memories that people recall.

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:48.430
It's hard for people to remember some
time exactly what year would take

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:49.420
something happened

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:52.870
but then they can look back at the
images and say okay like we can see that

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:56.830
in this girl he didn't you had part
X not part Y on your bike and so we know

00:00:56.830 --> 00:00:58.900
that this is when this innovation
happened.

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:00.190
