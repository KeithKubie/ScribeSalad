[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:07.600
LARRY YANG: I'm Larry Yang.

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:10.360
I am with the Play
Commerce team.

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:12.760
We are the team that
helps you collect money

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:14.140
from your players.

00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:16.360
And I'm here to
give you three ideas

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:19.060
on how you can make more money
than the person sitting next

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:20.470
to you.

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:21.940
So idea number one--

00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:25.030
collect some data
and do an experiment.

00:00:25.030 --> 00:00:27.820
Let's say you've just created
a brand new puzzle game

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:29.500
and you've just launched it.

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:31.720
And you're getting a
quarter million store

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:37.120
visits every week, 27% of them
are converting into installs.

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:38.170
That's great, right?

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:38.950
Is it great?

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:40.750
How do you know if
it's great or not?

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:44.140
So with a recently launched
feature in the Play Developer

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:47.260
console, you can now
compare your performance

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:48.860
against your peer group.

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:52.600
So now you see that your 27%
install conversion is actually

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:55.937
in the top quartile
of other puzzle games.

00:00:55.937 --> 00:00:56.770
That's great, right?

00:00:56.770 --> 00:00:58.690
Now you can break
out your champagne.

00:00:58.690 --> 00:00:59.680
But hold on.

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:01.330
What's that little
red bar that's

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:03.040
down there a little bit lower?

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:05.830
You scroll down and you
click in and now you

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:09.190
see whoa, WTF in South Korea.

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:11.830
You're actually
only at around 13%.

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:14.170
That's actually in
the lowest quartile.

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:15.640
What's going on?

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:17.740
So Play Developer
console will also

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:21.580
give you a suggestion to run
a store listings experiment.

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:24.280
Maybe the text in
your app description

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:27.190
isn't appropriate or doesn't
work for the local audience.

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:28.990
Maybe your screenshots
aren't localized,

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:30.490
so people in South
Korea are looking

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:31.870
at screenshots in
English and they're

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:33.550
like, I don't know
what this game does.

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:37.840
And so idea one, collect
some data, run an experiment,

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:41.482
and try to improve
your app performance.

00:01:41.482 --> 00:01:46.540
Idea number two, what's better
than a user that pays you once?

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:49.310
A user that pays you
every single month.

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:52.390
So a few developers are
starting to experiment

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:56.200
with the idea of subscribing
to non-consumable items

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:58.360
in their game.

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:00.670
Supercell's "Boom
Beach," in there you can

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:02.830
subscribe to an extra builder.

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:04.690
So now you can
rebuild your buildings

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:06.910
and build up your army and
get back to battle faster

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:09.110
than other people in the game.

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:12.010
Glu Mobile's "Deer
Hunter" has an ability--

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:14.140
they have multiple tiers
of subscriptions where

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:17.170
you can earn gold or
earn points and level up

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:22.120
faster so that you can level
up and get at the higher levels

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:23.570
faster.

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:26.920
In fact, when you look
across play and games,

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:30.580
we've seen a 50% increase in
the number of subscriptions

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:32.530
being offered in games.

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:36.910
So give that a try, think
about how a subscription might

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:39.700
be a way to generate
recurring revenue

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:44.330
as well as improving
your player engagement.

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:47.650
Idea number three
is around refunds.

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:51.860
What's better than refunding
somebody their money?

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:54.680
It's never refunding
that person their money.

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:59.540
So some of you are probably
familiar with refund abuse.

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:02.750
That's where a player
goes into your game,

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:06.200
they buy the bag of gems, and
then they go into the game

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:08.390
and they use the bag
of gems-- or worse,

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:11.210
they sell the bag of
gems on the black market.

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:14.369
Then they go and refund
and get their money back.

00:03:14.369 --> 00:03:16.160
So not only is that
bad, because you're not

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:17.720
getting any money
from this person,

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:19.820
but that person
is now destroying

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:22.400
your in-game economy.

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:25.490
So what we've
recently done is we

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:29.930
launched a new API called
voidedPurchases, where now you

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:33.680
know that that player
has gotten a refund.

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:35.540
And so now you can
go into the game,

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:38.280
into that player's profile,
and take back or claw back

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:40.839
that person's item.

00:03:40.839 --> 00:03:42.380
Before we had released
this recently,

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:44.870
we'd been doing some testing
with some early access

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:45.710
partners.

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:48.890
And we've seen
that with this API,

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:52.790
they've seen a significant
decrease in refunds.

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:55.220
This shows that a big
chunk of their refunds

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:57.890
were actually due to
this refund abuse.

00:03:57.890 --> 00:04:00.590
So give the
voidedPurchases API a try

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:05.840
and claw back and cut
down on your refund abuse.

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:08.990
So to recap, three ideas
to make more money.

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:11.360
Get some data,
run an experiment,

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:14.660
try subscriptions,
offering a subscription

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:17.829
to a nonconsumable item to
generate recurring revenue

00:04:17.829 --> 00:04:19.370
and increased engagement.

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:21.800
And thirdly, try the
voidedPurchases API

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:24.680
to cut down on refund abuse.

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:26.540
Thanks and good
luck with your game.

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:28.340
