00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:02.320
On that note, we're going to make our sunshine app

00:00:02.320 --> 00:00:05.410
100 times better now by connecting it over the network

00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:10.360
to the OpenWeatherMap service. OpenWeatherMap provides a free weather data

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:13.480
and forecast API. And the site is linked below, so

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:16.570
you can follow along. By scrolling through the site,

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:19.600
you can see what type of data is available. It

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:22.540
also has example queries so you can click on this

00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:25.440
one to see what the weather is like in London.

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:28.070
It includes a user friendly description of the weather

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:31.280
condition, such as broken clouds, in this case. And

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:34.110
we'll use this later in our app. For the

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:37.060
full list of weather conditions, you can go back to

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:40.330
the main page. And scroll down. And then, click

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:42.790
on this link here for the Weather Condition Codes.

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:45.700
And on this page, we have the full list

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:51.000
of weather conditions. It contains everything, from scattered clouds to

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.490
freezing rain, or even volcanic ash. I don't know

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:58.170
about you, but hopefully that doesn't happen too often.
