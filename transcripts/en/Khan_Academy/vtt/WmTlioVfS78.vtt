00:00:00.652 --> 00:00:01.527
- [Voiceover] Now we're gonna talk about

00:00:01.527 --> 00:00:02.571
the idea of impedance.

00:00:02.571 --> 00:00:05.007
This is a really important
idea in electronics

00:00:05.007 --> 00:00:09.413
and it's something that comes
from the study of AC analysis.

00:00:09.413 --> 00:00:12.931
And AC analysis is where we
limit ourselves to inputs

00:00:12.931 --> 00:00:17.354
to our circuits that look like
sinusoids, cosines or sines.

00:00:17.354 --> 00:00:19.848
And of all the signals
that we could possibly have

00:00:19.848 --> 00:00:22.284
in the entire universe,
we're gonna limit ourselves

00:00:22.284 --> 00:00:24.770
just for the moment, to sine waves.

00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:26.469
And there's some great simplifications

00:00:26.469 --> 00:00:28.740
that emerge from this.

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:30.232
So in this video, we're gonna look at,

00:00:30.232 --> 00:00:33.436
we're gonna develop,
basically the i-v equations

00:00:33.436 --> 00:00:36.507
for our three favorite passive components,

00:00:36.507 --> 00:00:39.704
resistor, inductor, and capacitor.

00:00:39.704 --> 00:00:43.871
And we're gonna look at those
when the input is a sinusoid.

00:00:47.247 --> 00:00:50.207
So that means that i or v,
the voltage or the current

00:00:50.207 --> 00:00:51.780
is in the shape of a sinusoid.

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:54.382
And we're gonna see what that
means for the i-v equations

00:00:54.382 --> 00:00:56.465
for our favorite devices.

00:00:58.073 --> 00:01:01.251
So as we look at i-v equations
with sinusoid inputs,

00:01:01.251 --> 00:01:03.514
we're actually gonna break down sinusoids

00:01:03.514 --> 00:01:05.681
into complex exponentials.

00:01:07.381 --> 00:01:09.536
And when we studied
sinusoids, we found out

00:01:09.536 --> 00:01:11.424
that we could disassemble sinusoids

00:01:11.424 --> 00:01:15.084
into complex exponentials
using Euler's equation.

00:01:15.084 --> 00:01:17.956
So, for example, if we have a cosine wave,

00:01:17.956 --> 00:01:20.376
if we have a cosine as a function of time,

00:01:20.376 --> 00:01:22.537
omega t, we can express that

00:01:22.537 --> 00:01:26.008
in terms of complex
exponentials like this:

00:01:26.008 --> 00:01:29.175
1/2 e to the plus j omega t

00:01:32.327 --> 00:01:34.827
plus e to the minus j omega t.

00:01:38.972 --> 00:01:39.805
Like that.

00:01:40.813 --> 00:01:42.470
And what I'm gonna do
now is I'm gonna say,

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:44.520
let's look at what happens

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.761
when we use this as an input signal.

00:01:46.761 --> 00:01:48.131
This is not a real input signal,

00:01:48.131 --> 00:01:51.108
it's an imaginary, rotating vector.

00:01:51.108 --> 00:01:52.598
But if I have two of these,

00:01:52.598 --> 00:01:55.592
I can reassemble them into a cosine wave.

00:01:55.592 --> 00:01:57.372
And we like to use these exponentials,

00:01:57.372 --> 00:01:59.577
because they go through
the differential equations

00:01:59.577 --> 00:02:01.388
of a circuit really easily.

00:02:01.388 --> 00:02:04.055
These are the inputs
that we know how to solve

00:02:04.055 --> 00:02:06.773
when we do differential equations.

00:02:06.773 --> 00:02:09.724
So what I'm gonna do is
develop the i-v equations

00:02:09.724 --> 00:02:12.334
for the resistor, inductor, and capacitor

00:02:12.334 --> 00:02:14.137
in terms of this kind of an input,

00:02:14.137 --> 00:02:16.359
when the voltage or the
current looks like this,

00:02:16.359 --> 00:02:19.224
what do those equations look like?

00:02:19.224 --> 00:02:23.391
So we're gonna start with,
we'll start with the resistor.

00:02:25.059 --> 00:02:27.378
Here's a resistor.

00:02:27.378 --> 00:02:30.625
And we know from that
that just Ohm's law is

00:02:30.625 --> 00:02:32.208
v equals i times R.

00:02:34.177 --> 00:02:36.933
And just for the moment I'm
gonna assume that the current,

00:02:36.933 --> 00:02:41.100
let's assume that i equals
e to the plus j omega t.

00:02:46.153 --> 00:02:49.918
So if this is i, what
is v for our resistor?

00:02:49.918 --> 00:02:51.691
Well, we just plug i in here

00:02:51.691 --> 00:02:53.274
and we get v equals

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:57.747
R times e to the plus j omega t.

00:03:02.144 --> 00:03:02.977
All right.

00:03:05.742 --> 00:03:07.277
Now I'm gonna do something that looks like

00:03:07.277 --> 00:03:08.591
it's a little too simple,

00:03:08.591 --> 00:03:10.985
but it's gonna get interesting soon.

00:03:10.985 --> 00:03:14.758
I wanna look at the ratio
of voltage to current.

00:03:14.758 --> 00:03:16.503
In this situation where we're driving

00:03:16.503 --> 00:03:19.439
with this complex exponential.

00:03:19.439 --> 00:03:23.606
So voltage turned out to be
R e to the plus j omega t

00:03:26.892 --> 00:03:30.303
and that's the voltage
I get if I put current

00:03:30.303 --> 00:03:34.220
though the resistor of
e to the plus j omega t.

00:03:35.879 --> 00:03:37.327
And what does that equal to?

00:03:37.327 --> 00:03:40.280
Well, these two are the
same so they cancel,

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:42.680
and I get the ratio of voltage to current

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:44.347
is R for a resistor.

00:03:46.592 --> 00:03:49.425
So for our resistor we just proved

00:03:50.691 --> 00:03:52.608
that v over i equals R.

00:03:59.159 --> 00:04:01.354
So this isn't news, we
didn't make a discovery here,

00:04:01.354 --> 00:04:03.130
this is just Ohm's law.

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:05.917
And for a resistor, the
voltage over the current

00:04:05.917 --> 00:04:07.875
is always equal to the resistance.

00:04:07.875 --> 00:04:08.708
All right.

00:04:08.708 --> 00:04:10.341
This is gonna get more
interesting now as we go do

00:04:10.341 --> 00:04:12.100
inductors and capcitors.

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:14.100
So let's do an inductor.

00:04:15.515 --> 00:04:17.812
It has a value of L henries.

00:04:17.812 --> 00:04:21.979
And for an inductor we know
that voltage equals L di dt.

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:29.284
All right, and let's do
the same thing again.

00:04:29.284 --> 00:04:32.284
Let i equal e to the plus j omega t.

00:04:34.887 --> 00:04:37.451
So it's a complex exponential current

00:04:37.451 --> 00:04:40.245
that we're forcing through our inductor.

00:04:40.245 --> 00:04:42.245
And let's go ahead and work out what v is.

00:04:42.245 --> 00:04:44.245
So v equals L times d dt

00:04:48.187 --> 00:04:51.854
of this value here, e
to the plus j omega t.

00:04:54.737 --> 00:04:58.662
Or v equals, now we take the derivative

00:04:58.662 --> 00:05:02.495
and the j omega term
comes down to multiply L,

00:05:04.069 --> 00:05:06.652
so we get j omega L times what?

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:13.431
Times the same thing, e
to the plus j omega t,

00:05:13.431 --> 00:05:15.565
this is the beautiful
thing about exponentials,

00:05:15.565 --> 00:05:17.982
they give us back themselves.

00:05:19.014 --> 00:05:20.657
All right, now let's do this.

00:05:20.657 --> 00:05:22.439
Let's take, once more,

00:05:22.439 --> 00:05:26.207
what's the ratio of voltage to current?

00:05:26.207 --> 00:05:29.114
And that equals, here's the voltage,

00:05:29.114 --> 00:05:32.447
j omega L times e to the plus j omega t,

00:05:34.351 --> 00:05:39.141
and let's divide that by i
which is i is right here,

00:05:39.141 --> 00:05:41.558
i is e to the plus j omega t.

00:05:44.039 --> 00:05:45.456
So, those cancel.

00:05:47.456 --> 00:05:48.289
And we get

00:05:49.962 --> 00:05:52.129
v over i equals j omega L.

00:06:01.910 --> 00:06:05.774
So now we have an equation
for v over i for an inductor.

00:06:05.774 --> 00:06:07.008
And this is interesting,

00:06:07.008 --> 00:06:09.738
this time we have the inductance value

00:06:09.738 --> 00:06:13.519
which we expected, and
there's also this omega,

00:06:13.519 --> 00:06:15.573
j omega term that comes in.

00:06:15.573 --> 00:06:18.429
So this tells us this is
frequency, omega is frequency.

00:06:18.429 --> 00:06:22.765
So this tells us that the
ratio of v to i for an inductor

00:06:22.765 --> 00:06:24.932
is dependent on frequency.

00:06:29.743 --> 00:06:31.532
Now we'll do the same
thing for a capacitor.

00:06:31.532 --> 00:06:33.365
So here's a capacitor.

00:06:35.521 --> 00:06:38.585
And there's it's
capacitance value in farads.

00:06:38.585 --> 00:06:42.752
And for the capacitor, we know
that i equals C times dv dt.

00:06:48.697 --> 00:06:51.427
And this time let's let v of t,

00:06:51.427 --> 00:06:54.927
let's let v equal e to the plus j omega t.

00:06:57.186 --> 00:06:58.587
So this time we're gonna force

00:06:58.587 --> 00:07:00.597
a voltage across our capacitor

00:07:00.597 --> 00:07:05.458
that is this imaginary,
this complex exponential.

00:07:05.458 --> 00:07:07.332
And that gives us, let's
plug that into here,

00:07:07.332 --> 00:07:09.082
i equals C times d dt

00:07:13.659 --> 00:07:15.909
of e to the plus j omega t.

00:07:20.255 --> 00:07:22.755
Now let's take that derivative

00:07:23.763 --> 00:07:26.379
i equals, same thing happens,

00:07:26.379 --> 00:07:29.585
j omega comes down to
multiply out in front with C,

00:07:29.585 --> 00:07:31.006
and we get the same thing over here.

00:07:31.006 --> 00:07:33.089
So we get j omega C times

00:07:35.816 --> 00:07:37.816
e to the plus j omega t.

00:07:39.387 --> 00:07:41.165
And now we'll ask the same question again

00:07:41.165 --> 00:07:45.332
that we did before, which is
what is v over i for capacitor?

00:07:47.386 --> 00:07:48.338
And we can fill this in,

00:07:48.338 --> 00:07:52.987
v is sitting right here,
v is e to the j omega t,

00:07:52.987 --> 00:07:54.904
e to the plus j omega t

00:07:57.652 --> 00:08:01.588
and the current is, we
worked that out down here,

00:08:01.588 --> 00:08:02.921
that's j omega C

00:08:05.779 --> 00:08:08.279
times e to the plus j omega t.

00:08:11.099 --> 00:08:13.340
And once again, we get this
nice cancellation here,

00:08:13.340 --> 00:08:17.708
this cancels with this,
and for capacitor we get

00:08:17.708 --> 00:08:18.958
v over i equals

00:08:21.212 --> 00:08:22.795
one over j omega C.

00:08:26.944 --> 00:08:30.027
And we put a box around that one too.

00:08:34.803 --> 00:08:37.108
So this says that the
ratio of voltage to current

00:08:37.108 --> 00:08:39.792
in a capacitor, it depends on
the value of the capacitor,

00:08:39.792 --> 00:08:43.435
of course, and it also
depends on frequency.

00:08:43.435 --> 00:08:45.126
So just like over with the inductor,

00:08:45.126 --> 00:08:48.364
we have a frequency term in here.

00:08:48.364 --> 00:08:52.250
So now we're gonna give this
ratio of voltage to current

00:08:52.250 --> 00:08:54.613
in all three cases, we're
gonna give a special name

00:08:54.613 --> 00:08:56.863
and that name is impedance.

00:09:02.058 --> 00:09:06.141
And the symbol we often
use for impedance is a Z.

00:09:07.471 --> 00:09:09.386
So this word impedance
is the general notion

00:09:09.386 --> 00:09:12.419
of the ratio of voltage to current.

00:09:12.419 --> 00:09:16.331
And we can do that for all
three of our passive components.

00:09:16.331 --> 00:09:20.498
For a resistor, the impedance
is its resistance, R.

00:09:21.918 --> 00:09:24.789
So the word impedance is
like the word resistance,

00:09:24.789 --> 00:09:26.488
except it's a more general concept.

00:09:26.488 --> 00:09:29.752
It's the general concept of
voltage divided by current.

00:09:29.752 --> 00:09:33.737
For a resistor, the
impedance is the resistance.

00:09:33.737 --> 00:09:37.904
For an inductor, the impedance,
v over i is j omega L.

00:09:40.796 --> 00:09:43.088
And down here for
capacitor, the impedance is

00:09:43.088 --> 00:09:46.581
one over j omega C, for capacitance.

00:09:46.581 --> 00:09:49.634
So this is where the idea of
impedance, this word impedance,

00:09:49.634 --> 00:09:51.934
this is where it comes from.

00:09:51.934 --> 00:09:55.383
And the idea includes both
the values of the components

00:09:55.383 --> 00:09:58.420
and the effect that frequency has

00:09:58.420 --> 00:10:01.597
on the voltage to current ratio.

00:10:01.597 --> 00:10:05.764
So both of those things
are combined into one idea.

00:10:10.451 --> 00:10:12.803
So just a quick summary of impedance,

00:10:12.803 --> 00:10:16.970
if we say the impedance of
a resistor, that equals R.

00:10:17.960 --> 00:10:21.793
The impedance of an
inductor equals j omega L.

00:10:24.888 --> 00:10:28.259
And the impedance of a capacitor

00:10:28.259 --> 00:10:30.426
equals one over j omega C.

00:10:35.821 --> 00:10:37.930
And as a reminder of
the assumptions we made,

00:10:37.930 --> 00:10:41.302
we said that we're only gonna
consider sinusoidal inputs.

00:10:41.302 --> 00:10:44.392
And what we did is we
broke up our sinusoid,

00:10:44.392 --> 00:10:46.495
our cosine wave, into these,

00:10:46.495 --> 00:10:48.336
we looked at how these
rotating vectors passed

00:10:48.336 --> 00:10:52.503
through our components in the
form of voltages and currents.

00:10:53.422 --> 00:10:54.517
So there's no new physics here.

00:10:54.517 --> 00:10:56.861
What happened is we took these j omegas

00:10:56.861 --> 00:10:59.197
that came out of the exponentials

00:10:59.197 --> 00:11:00.520
when we took the derivatives,

00:11:00.520 --> 00:11:04.436
we associated those with
the component itself,

00:11:04.436 --> 00:11:06.457
we did that here and we did that here,

00:11:06.457 --> 00:11:07.585
and you can see it here.

00:11:07.585 --> 00:11:08.820
So we sort of done,

00:11:08.820 --> 00:11:11.630
it's somewhat of a notational trick.

00:11:11.630 --> 00:11:13.767
We associate this frequency dependence,

00:11:13.767 --> 00:11:16.995
not with the inputs and
the voltages and currents,

00:11:16.995 --> 00:11:19.912
but with the components themselves.

00:11:21.426 --> 00:11:22.677
And this is something we call,

00:11:22.677 --> 00:11:25.677
this is referred to as transforming.

00:11:30.198 --> 00:11:32.392
We transformed our components.

00:11:32.392 --> 00:11:34.377
That's the phrase that's used there.

00:11:34.377 --> 00:11:36.520
But from this comes the idea of impedance

00:11:36.520 --> 00:11:40.100
and in the general sense of
the voltage to current ratio.
