00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:05.400
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:07.710
- Good afternoon, everybody.

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:08.860
My name is Dan Carpenter.

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:12.940
I teach in the government
department here at Harvard.

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:16.820
And I direct the social sciences
program in academic ventures

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:19.400
at the Radcliffe Institute.

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:22.940
I want to begin by acknowledging
the Wampanoag, Massachusetts,

00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:27.260
and Nipmuc peoples on whose
homelands we gather today.

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:32.420
And before turning to the Layli
Long Soldier poetry event,

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:35.180
I want to give you,
first, a welcome on behalf

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:38.570
of the Radcliffe Institute
and on behalf of our dean,

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:41.960
Lizabeth Cohen, who
cannot be with us today,

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:45.920
and also just to offer a remark.

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:48.740
What is happening today,
this poetry series,

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:52.850
this event with Layli
Long Soldier and others

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:55.340
are part of a larger
collaboration,

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:58.130
between the Radcliffe Institute
and the Harvard University

00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:03.160
Native American
program, to enhance

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:07.490
the visibility, the presence the
continuance of native peoples

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:10.550
at Harvard University,
in collaboration

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:13.280
with the native
communities in our midst

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:16.340
and in keeping with
what we hope is

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:20.930
a much better embrace of
Harvard's responsibilities,

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:27.920
under its charter, to engage
with, collaborate with,

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:33.530
and continue the presence
of native communities.

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:37.680
That includes past events
in this poetry reading,

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:42.560
including an appearance by the
Anishinaabe poet Gerald Vizenor

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:46.640
and the Navajo poet Luci
Tapahonso in recent years,

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:51.650
by the 2016 conference "Native
Peoples, Native Politics,"

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:55.670
by Monday's event, "Citizen
Indigenous,"-- which I hear

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:56.760
was a grand success.

00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:58.880
I'm sorry I wasn't
able to make it--

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:00.830
and by an ongoing
research project.

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:04.970
And I'm listing just a few of
many ongoing collaborations,

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:07.370
again, between
Radcliffe and HUNAP,

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:10.220
called the Digital Archive
of Native American Petitions

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:12.770
in Massachusetts, which
is in the process,

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:15.530
in the coming weeks,
of publishing over

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:19.550
500 Native American
petitions currently

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:22.580
in the Massachusetts
archives online,

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:26.480
from the 1640s to the 1870s.

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:32.300
This is a collaboration that has
been enriching and educational

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:33.200
for Radcliffe.

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:36.860
I hope it's been
somewhat that for HUNAP.

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:39.830
We're proud to be
collaborating with HUNAP.

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:43.650
And we intend to do
so for years to come.

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:50.360
I want to now turn over the
event to Dr. Nick Estes.

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:54.950
Nick Estes is a member of
the Lower Brule Sioux tribe.

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:58.400
He's Kul Wicasa from the
Lower Brule Sioux tribe.

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:02.210
And in 2014, he founded
the group the Red Nation

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:04.490
in Albuquerque, New Mexico.

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:07.220
The Red Nation is a native-led
political organization

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:10.970
committed to revitalizing
indigenous kinship relations

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:13.700
and combating anti-indigenous
violence in all

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:16.910
of its manifestations, whether
from police or prisons,

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:20.480
discrimination in off
reservation spaces,

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:25.340
against native women,
youth, and LGBTQ2 issues.

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:27.530
He is currently a
doctoral candidate

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:30.620
in American studies at the
University of New Mexico.

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:34.400
But actually, to update
that-- apologies-- he

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:37.460
is the American Democracy
fellow at the Charles Warren

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:39.650
Center for North
American history,

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:42.890
here, at Harvard, and
assistant professor

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:45.770
in American studies at the
University of New Mexico.

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:48.745
And I'm sorry I butchered
something there for certain.

00:03:48.745 --> 00:03:51.210
But you can get me
back another time.

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:56.030
So it is with honor and pride
that we welcome Layli Long

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:56.910
Soldier today.

00:03:56.910 --> 00:03:58.350
But first, Dr. Nick Estes.

00:03:58.350 --> 00:03:58.850
Thank you.

00:03:58.850 --> 00:04:12.810
[APPLAUSE]

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:17.240
- [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:21.920
I want to again recognize
the original homelands

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:27.410
of the Massachusett peoples as
well as the shared territory

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:29.840
of the Wampanoag and Nipmuc.

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:35.150
I also want to extend
a thank you to HUNAP

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:39.170
for supporting this and
keeping these kinds of events

00:04:39.170 --> 00:04:41.810
going at Harvard University.

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:43.970
Having been here for
just under a year,

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:46.490
I have a profound appreciation
for the kind of work

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:50.910
that people like Shelly
and Jason do here.

00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:53.220
And I also want to thank
the Radcliffe Institution.

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:57.740
And I'm saying these thank yous,
because I've never introduced

00:04:57.740 --> 00:05:00.890
a fellow Lakota writer before.

00:05:00.890 --> 00:05:02.150
So it's a big deal for me.

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:06.410
And it couldn't have
been more of a privilege

00:05:06.410 --> 00:05:08.300
to introduce one
of our own such,

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:13.400
as Layli Long Soldier, who is a
citizen of the Ogallala Lakota

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:14.274
Nation.

00:05:14.274 --> 00:05:16.190
And from what I understand,
this year's theme,

00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:20.300
for the Radcliffe Institute,
is citizenship and belonging.

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:23.510
And Layli holds a BFA,
from the Institute

00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:27.950
of American Indian Arts, and
an MFA from Bard College.

00:05:27.950 --> 00:05:33.050
She has served as a contributing
editor of Drunken Boat.

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:36.500
Her poems have appeared in the
American Poet, the American

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:40.820
Reader, the Kenyon Review
Online, and other publications.

00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:46.370
And she is the author of
the chapbook, Chromosomory,

00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:49.990
and Whereas, which won the
National Books Critics Circle

00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:53.690
Award and was a finalist for
the National Book Awards.

00:05:53.690 --> 00:05:57.230
And in 2015, Layli was awarded
the National Artist Fellowship

00:05:57.230 --> 00:05:59.990
from the Native Artists
and Cultures Foundation

00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:03.440
and a Lannan Literary
Fellowship for her poetry.

00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:07.340
And without further
ado, please give a warm

00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:09.040
welcome to Layli Long Soldier.

00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:19.886
[APPLAUSE]

00:06:26.310 --> 00:06:27.620
- Thank you so much, Nick.

00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:39.386
Layli [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:46.160
First of all, before
I start, I want

00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:49.970
to say I forgot to
bring my other glasses.

00:06:49.970 --> 00:06:54.090
So I can't see the best.

00:06:54.090 --> 00:06:55.790
So I'm going to do my best here.

00:06:59.810 --> 00:07:04.130
I'm going to start off with
some poems about grass,

00:07:04.130 --> 00:07:10.160
because the sky is gray outside.

00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:11.740
And we've had some snow.

00:07:11.740 --> 00:07:17.100
And it makes me want something
a little warmer right now.

00:07:17.100 --> 00:07:19.910
So we'll start there.

00:07:26.620 --> 00:07:27.550
Oh, goodness.

00:07:27.550 --> 00:07:29.530
[LAUGHS]

00:07:33.485 --> 00:07:33.985
"Look."

00:07:36.960 --> 00:07:44.380
"The light grass
body whole wholly

00:07:44.380 --> 00:07:54.960
moves a green hill 'til
I pull stalk 'n root up

00:07:54.960 --> 00:08:01.600
from black matte soil bed.

00:08:01.600 --> 00:08:11.720
Beads from grass heads,
one by one a part

00:08:11.720 --> 00:08:23.760
I split grass wires, little
bulbs, silver green drop

00:08:23.760 --> 00:08:36.049
lets I sentence to life
less light quick dead grass

00:08:36.049 --> 00:08:47.850
skulls, weight less pile,
dry mound in cupped palm.

00:08:47.850 --> 00:08:51.510
What have I done?

00:08:51.510 --> 00:08:57.450
What now to do?

00:08:57.450 --> 00:09:06.580
Why this impulse to
shake the dead light?

00:09:06.580 --> 00:09:17.020
Why do I so want the light
to blink, look alive, move?

00:09:17.020 --> 00:09:21.890
Why do I so want it still?"

00:09:26.340 --> 00:09:28.130
I wrote that.

00:09:28.130 --> 00:09:32.980
I wrote a lot about
grass in this book.

00:09:32.980 --> 00:09:38.580
And a lot of that was
because, at the time when

00:09:38.580 --> 00:09:42.720
I wrote most of these poems, I
was living in the Four Corners,

00:09:42.720 --> 00:09:44.580
on the Navajo Nation.

00:09:44.580 --> 00:09:49.230
And when I would go up
north to visit my family,

00:09:49.230 --> 00:09:53.520
always, the first thing
that represented home

00:09:53.520 --> 00:09:58.240
was the grass, the smell
and the sight of it.

00:09:58.240 --> 00:10:02.830
And then, when I would come
back to the Four Corners,

00:10:02.830 --> 00:10:06.480
Southwest, that was the
first thing I would miss

00:10:06.480 --> 00:10:07.620
is the grass.

00:10:07.620 --> 00:10:09.420
But I noticed that--

00:10:09.420 --> 00:10:14.430
And this little poem was kind
of like about the dark side

00:10:14.430 --> 00:10:16.970
of myself.

00:10:16.970 --> 00:10:19.260
As much as I love the
grass, the first thing

00:10:19.260 --> 00:10:21.760
I noticed I would do,
when I would go up north,

00:10:21.760 --> 00:10:25.760
is grab a handful and
then pick it apart.

00:10:25.760 --> 00:10:29.230
And one day I said,
what is my problem?

00:10:29.230 --> 00:10:31.720
Why so destructive?

00:10:31.720 --> 00:10:34.125
[LAUGHS]

00:10:43.270 --> 00:10:46.270
"Steady Summer."

00:10:46.270 --> 00:10:54.910
"Solstice grasses, see this
one's a natural anesthetic,

00:10:54.910 --> 00:10:57.710
he said.

00:10:57.710 --> 00:11:03.470
When they fast,
they cannot food.

00:11:03.470 --> 00:11:10.310
Careful water so slide,
grass needle tips

00:11:10.310 --> 00:11:16.370
around the edges of
wounds this summer.

00:11:16.370 --> 00:11:23.451
Potent grass songs,
a grass chorus moves.

00:11:23.451 --> 00:11:23.950
Shhh.

00:11:27.560 --> 00:11:31.890
Through half-propped
windows, I swallow

00:11:31.890 --> 00:11:36.260
grass scent, the solstice.

00:11:36.260 --> 00:11:38.770
Makes a mind wide.

00:11:38.770 --> 00:11:44.840
Makes it oceanic blue,
a field in crests,

00:11:44.840 --> 00:11:53.490
swirling gyres, the moving
surface fastened in June light.

00:11:53.490 --> 00:12:02.460
Here I'm certain that certain
kinds of talk only equal pain.

00:12:02.460 --> 00:12:08.250
Excusing myself, I
paddle grass waves.

00:12:08.250 --> 00:12:12.540
I'm safer outdoors than in.

00:12:12.540 --> 00:12:20.730
In those heady grasses, the
mouth loosens, confesses.

00:12:20.730 --> 00:12:27.350
I don't trust nobody
but the land, I said.

00:12:27.350 --> 00:12:34.240
I don't mean present
company, of course.

00:12:34.240 --> 00:12:40.920
You understand, the grasses
hear me, too, always.

00:12:40.920 --> 00:12:42.455
Present the grasses.

00:12:45.050 --> 00:12:51.640
Confident grasses,
polite--" excuse me.

00:12:54.190 --> 00:12:55.150
Excuse me.

00:12:55.150 --> 00:13:00.763
"--polite command to shhh.

00:13:00.763 --> 00:13:03.980
Shhh, listen.

00:13:06.830 --> 00:13:11.570
At the bottom of trailer
steps, grasshoppers power up,

00:13:11.570 --> 00:13:17.810
plate bodies, jet wings
knock knock high speed

00:13:17.810 --> 00:13:25.760
thru a swaying green page,
single-spaced, blades bold

00:13:25.760 --> 00:13:30.364
hollow stems, air italics.

00:13:30.364 --> 00:13:30.864
Shhh.

00:13:36.720 --> 00:13:41.990
In midday open, two
horseflies love-buzz,

00:13:41.990 --> 00:13:47.820
a simple humid
meeting, motorized sex

00:13:47.820 --> 00:13:54.503
in place, then loose again,
infinite circle eights.

00:13:54.503 --> 00:13:55.003
Shhh.

00:13:58.431 --> 00:13:58.931
Listen.

00:14:02.370 --> 00:14:08.530
Down the path, Auntie
steps onto the porch.

00:14:08.530 --> 00:14:17.880
The dog pads across wood planks,
a pause to nudge her foot.

00:14:17.880 --> 00:14:18.380
Shhh.

00:14:23.220 --> 00:14:29.020
In my thoughts, I hear
her, two states away,

00:14:29.020 --> 00:14:32.080
ask for more mac 'n cheese.

00:14:32.080 --> 00:14:36.730
This is good, Dad, my favorite.

00:14:36.730 --> 00:14:43.420
Their forks click in blue
gardens, flowered borders,

00:14:43.420 --> 00:14:47.780
scrubbed second-hand plates.

00:14:47.780 --> 00:14:48.280
Shhh.

00:14:51.970 --> 00:14:56.118
This grass shhh.

00:14:57.118 --> 00:14:57.618
Shhh."

00:15:00.530 --> 00:15:02.000
What an interesting exchange.

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:05.300
[LAUGHTER]

00:15:05.300 --> 00:15:05.815
Good timing.

00:15:10.940 --> 00:15:12.700
"Who have I become?"

00:15:19.050 --> 00:15:23.400
I have something to say
quickly about that piece.

00:15:23.400 --> 00:15:27.210
I'm having a little
conversation, right now.

00:15:27.210 --> 00:15:29.230
Well, I'm a little behind.

00:15:29.230 --> 00:15:33.270
But we started this
conversation between myself

00:15:33.270 --> 00:15:35.580
and Solmaz Sharif.

00:15:35.580 --> 00:15:37.720
Are you familiar with her work?

00:15:37.720 --> 00:15:43.680
And she has a piece where
she uses the word "whereas"

00:15:43.680 --> 00:15:45.510
repetitively, as well.

00:15:45.510 --> 00:15:49.280
So we're kind of discussing
our work with that language.

00:15:49.280 --> 00:15:53.730
But she was talking a
little bit about the use

00:15:53.730 --> 00:16:00.510
of the erotic in her work and
how important that was in order

00:16:00.510 --> 00:16:09.280
to kind of humanize her position
in the world and her people,

00:16:09.280 --> 00:16:11.570
that humanization.

00:16:11.570 --> 00:16:15.290
And so, anyway, I
really appreciated that.

00:16:15.290 --> 00:16:16.710
And I was thinking--

00:16:16.710 --> 00:16:20.270
but I couldn't help but think,
oh, have I done that in my work

00:16:20.270 --> 00:16:20.990
at all?

00:16:20.990 --> 00:16:23.180
Is there that presence?

00:16:23.180 --> 00:16:25.360
And I couldn't think
of any instance.

00:16:25.360 --> 00:16:30.040
And the closest I got was
two horseflies [LAUGHS]

00:16:30.040 --> 00:16:30.860
in this piece.

00:16:30.860 --> 00:16:49.310
[LAUGHS] Too embarrassed

00:16:49.310 --> 00:16:53.420
I think that I'm going to
actually move on and read

00:16:53.420 --> 00:16:58.040
from the second part
of my book, which

00:16:58.040 --> 00:17:02.300
is the self-titled
section, "Whereas."

00:17:02.300 --> 00:17:08.660
And that is where I respond
to the national apology

00:17:08.660 --> 00:17:11.690
to Native Americans.

00:17:11.690 --> 00:17:17.740
So I think I'll start
off with the introduction

00:17:17.740 --> 00:17:18.849
to that section.

00:17:18.849 --> 00:17:23.260
Just in case you don't know
much about that apology,

00:17:23.260 --> 00:17:24.676
it's a little background.

00:17:28.490 --> 00:17:32.800
On Saturday,
December 19th, 2009,

00:17:32.800 --> 00:17:37.220
US President Barack Obama signed
the Congressional Resolution

00:17:37.220 --> 00:17:41.270
of Apology to Native Americans.

00:17:41.270 --> 00:17:46.490
No tribal leaders or
official representatives

00:17:46.490 --> 00:17:51.920
were invited to witness or
receive the apology on behalf

00:17:51.920 --> 00:17:54.870
of their tribal nations.

00:17:54.870 --> 00:18:01.990
President Obama never read
the apology aloud, publicly,

00:18:01.990 --> 00:18:04.980
although, for the record,
Senator Brownback,

00:18:04.980 --> 00:18:10.140
five months later, read the
apology to a gathering of five

00:18:10.140 --> 00:18:12.060
tribal leaders.

00:18:12.060 --> 00:18:17.711
Bearing in mind, there are
over 560 federally recognized

00:18:17.711 --> 00:18:18.210
tribes.

00:18:18.210 --> 00:18:23.220
So 5 out of 560, I
think, is less than 1%.

00:18:27.830 --> 00:18:33.410
The apology was then folded
into a larger, unrelated piece

00:18:33.410 --> 00:18:39.894
of legislation, called the 2010
Defense Appropriations Act.

00:18:39.894 --> 00:18:40.680
[LAUGHTER]

00:18:40.680 --> 00:18:44.990
So [LAUGHS] yeah,
that was me, too.

00:18:44.990 --> 00:18:45.910
Yeah.

00:18:45.910 --> 00:18:47.290
[LAUGHS]

00:18:48.670 --> 00:18:52.700
I mean I understand that that's
how things get moved through.

00:18:52.700 --> 00:18:56.520
But it says a lot.

00:18:56.520 --> 00:19:00.140
So my response is
directed to the apology--

00:19:00.140 --> 00:19:03.860
excuse me, the apology's
delivery, as well as

00:19:03.860 --> 00:19:09.140
the language, crafting, and the
arrangement of their written

00:19:09.140 --> 00:19:11.230
document.

00:19:11.230 --> 00:19:15.520
"I am a citizen of
the United States.

00:19:15.520 --> 00:19:17.950
And I am enrolled.

00:19:17.950 --> 00:19:21.340
I'm an enrolled member of
the Ogallala Lakota tribe,

00:19:21.340 --> 00:19:26.770
meaning I am a citizen of
the Ogallala Lakota Nation.

00:19:26.770 --> 00:19:36.740
And in this dual citizenship,
I must work, I must eat,

00:19:36.740 --> 00:19:47.250
I must mother, I must
friend, I must listen.

00:19:47.250 --> 00:19:48.480
I skipped one.

00:19:48.480 --> 00:19:52.120
I must art.

00:19:52.120 --> 00:19:54.880
I must observe.

00:19:54.880 --> 00:19:57.800
Constantly, I must live."

00:20:13.110 --> 00:20:22.830
"Whereas when offered an
apology, I watch each movement,

00:20:22.830 --> 00:20:30.090
the shoulders high or
folding, tilt of the head,

00:20:30.090 --> 00:20:36.250
both eyes down or through me.

00:20:36.250 --> 00:20:42.620
I listen for cracks in
knuckles or in the word choice.

00:20:42.620 --> 00:20:46.520
What is it that I want?

00:20:46.520 --> 00:20:48.970
To feel.

00:20:48.970 --> 00:20:55.440
And mind you, I feel
from the senses.

00:20:55.440 --> 00:20:58.830
I read each muscle.

00:20:58.830 --> 00:21:03.740
I ask the strength of the
gesture to move like a poem.

00:21:06.610 --> 00:21:12.460
Expectation's a terse
arm-fold, a failing

00:21:12.460 --> 00:21:18.355
noun-thing I scold myself
in the mirror for holding.

00:21:21.390 --> 00:21:26.610
Because I learn
from young poets.

00:21:26.610 --> 00:21:32.670
One sends me new work,
spotted with salt crystals

00:21:32.670 --> 00:21:35.880
she metaphors as her tears.

00:21:38.410 --> 00:21:47.850
I feel her phrases, quote,
"I say," and "Understand me,"

00:21:47.850 --> 00:21:49.455
and "I wonder."

00:21:52.590 --> 00:21:58.230
Pages are cavernous
places, white at entrance,

00:21:58.230 --> 00:22:01.100
black in absorption.

00:22:01.100 --> 00:22:01.599
Echo.

00:22:05.310 --> 00:22:16.550
If I'm transformed by language,
I am often crouched in footnote

00:22:16.550 --> 00:22:18.315
or blazing in title.

00:22:21.090 --> 00:22:23.970
Where in the body do I begin?"

00:22:38.900 --> 00:22:47.330
"Whereas a friend senses
what she calls cultural

00:22:47.330 --> 00:22:51.020
emptiness in a poet's work.

00:22:51.020 --> 00:22:57.770
And after reading, she feels bad
for feeling bad for the poet,

00:22:57.770 --> 00:23:00.860
she admits.

00:23:00.860 --> 00:23:03.020
I want to respond,
the same could

00:23:03.020 --> 00:23:11.910
be said for me, some sticky
current of Indian emptiness.

00:23:11.910 --> 00:23:15.810
I feel it not just
in my poems, but when

00:23:15.810 --> 00:23:23.010
I'm on drives, in conversations,
or as I lie down to sleep.

00:23:23.010 --> 00:23:28.380
But since this dialogue
is about writing,

00:23:28.380 --> 00:23:31.400
I want to be correct
with my languageness.

00:23:34.150 --> 00:23:40.360
In a note following
the entry for "Indian"

00:23:40.360 --> 00:23:45.110
an Oxford dictionary
warns: do not

00:23:45.110 --> 00:23:49.070
use "Indian" or
"Red Indian" to talk

00:23:49.070 --> 00:23:55.120
about American native peoples,
as these terms are now

00:23:55.120 --> 00:24:00.165
outdated; use "American
Indian" instead."

00:24:02.790 --> 00:24:05.780
[CHUCKLES] I'm so
grateful to know that.

00:24:05.780 --> 00:24:06.515
Thank you.

00:24:06.515 --> 00:24:08.115
[LAUGHTER]

00:24:08.115 --> 00:24:14.630
"So I explain,
perhaps the same could

00:24:14.630 --> 00:24:22.640
be said for my work, some burden
of American Indian emptiness

00:24:22.640 --> 00:24:28.220
in my poems, how American
Indian emptiness surfaces

00:24:28.220 --> 00:24:34.010
not just on the page but often
on drives, in conversations,

00:24:34.010 --> 00:24:37.590
or when I lie down to sleep.

00:24:37.590 --> 00:24:44.340
But the term "American Indian"
points--" excuse me-- "parts

00:24:44.340 --> 00:24:51.540
our conversation, like
a hollow, bloated boat

00:24:51.540 --> 00:24:57.150
that is not ours, that
neither my friend nor I

00:24:57.150 --> 00:25:02.270
want to board
knowing it will never

00:25:02.270 --> 00:25:05.780
take us anywhere but to rot.

00:25:09.650 --> 00:25:17.730
If the language of race is ever
really attached to emptiness.

00:25:17.730 --> 00:25:27.130
Whatever it is, I feel now has
me in the hull, head, knees,

00:25:27.130 --> 00:25:33.710
feet curled, I dare
say, to fetal position,

00:25:33.710 --> 00:25:38.260
but better stated
as the form I resort

00:25:38.260 --> 00:25:43.220
to inside the jaws
of a reference."

00:25:47.220 --> 00:25:50.130
That piece I read was
actually the first piece

00:25:50.130 --> 00:25:54.660
I wrote for this whole series.

00:25:54.660 --> 00:25:57.990
I remember being
frustrated, at home,

00:25:57.990 --> 00:26:01.830
when this apology came out.

00:26:01.830 --> 00:26:05.630
I had a lot to say about it.

00:26:05.630 --> 00:26:08.270
I had never really
written work that

00:26:08.270 --> 00:26:14.240
was overtly political
or directly political.

00:26:14.240 --> 00:26:16.070
But one day I decided--

00:26:16.070 --> 00:26:19.960
I thought-- I felt
so frustrated.

00:26:19.960 --> 00:26:23.830
I was like, well, there's
a lot that I cannot do.

00:26:23.830 --> 00:26:27.160
But one thing I can do is write.

00:26:27.160 --> 00:26:28.940
I can do that.

00:26:28.940 --> 00:26:30.490
So I'm going to do it.

00:26:30.490 --> 00:26:34.830
So I remember sitting down,
and that was the first piece.

00:26:34.830 --> 00:26:39.550
And I got out the dictionary--
that was the first thing I

00:26:39.550 --> 00:26:40.360
did--

00:26:40.360 --> 00:26:46.870
to look up "Indian" to see how
it is defined, in the Oxford

00:26:46.870 --> 00:26:50.140
dictionary, of all
things, and to see

00:26:50.140 --> 00:26:55.180
what is used to refer to
me, in that case, you know?

00:26:55.180 --> 00:26:56.950
But anyway, I remember
it getting done

00:26:56.950 --> 00:26:58.410
and feeling really--

00:26:58.410 --> 00:26:59.870
it felt good.

00:26:59.870 --> 00:27:03.350
It felt good to get
to write something.

00:27:03.350 --> 00:27:05.290
But as soon as I
was done, I realized

00:27:05.290 --> 00:27:08.740
that one piece was not enough.

00:27:08.740 --> 00:27:10.370
It would not be enough.

00:27:10.370 --> 00:27:14.563
So I ended up writing 28 pieces.

00:27:14.563 --> 00:27:16.495
[LAUGHS]

00:27:22.780 --> 00:27:25.170
So I'm going to read a piece.

00:27:25.170 --> 00:27:34.110
Now that I read about how
we're referred to in English,

00:27:34.110 --> 00:27:37.800
this is a piece how we
understand ourselves,

00:27:37.800 --> 00:27:42.420
at least Lakota people, which
is a very different feeling

00:27:42.420 --> 00:27:44.730
to say, I'm American Indian.

00:27:44.730 --> 00:27:47.770
Actually, I never say that.

00:27:47.770 --> 00:27:50.310
But to say that is a very
different feeling than to say,

00:27:50.310 --> 00:27:52.020
I am Lakota.

00:27:52.020 --> 00:27:55.200
And that's something
we've called ourselves

00:27:55.200 --> 00:27:57.120
for much longer.

00:28:02.070 --> 00:28:10.000
"Whereas I did not desire in
childhood to be a part of this

00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:16.970
but desired most of
all to be a part,

00:28:16.970 --> 00:28:22.520
a piece combined with others
to make up a whole, some

00:28:22.520 --> 00:28:25.670
but not all of something.

00:28:25.670 --> 00:28:33.640
In Lakota it's onspa, a
piece or part of anything,

00:28:33.640 --> 00:28:38.800
like the creek trickling behind
my auntie's house, where Uncle

00:28:38.800 --> 00:28:43.690
built her a bridge to cross
from bank to bank, not

00:28:43.690 --> 00:28:50.830
far from a grassy clearing, with
three tipis, a place to gather.

00:28:50.830 --> 00:28:55.150
She holds three-day workshops
on traditional arts.

00:28:55.150 --> 00:28:59.620
Young people from
Kyle and Potato Creek

00:28:59.620 --> 00:29:05.890
arrive, one by one,
eager to part-ticipate.

00:29:05.890 --> 00:29:08.830
They have the option,
my auntie says,

00:29:08.830 --> 00:29:12.010
to sleep at home or
return in the morning.

00:29:12.010 --> 00:29:15.910
But by and large, they'll
stay and camp even

00:29:15.910 --> 00:29:19.630
during South Dakota winters.

00:29:19.630 --> 00:29:21.620
The comfort of being together.

00:29:24.190 --> 00:29:29.710
I think of Plains
winds, snow drifts, ice,

00:29:29.710 --> 00:29:33.070
and limbs, the exposure.

00:29:33.070 --> 00:29:36.940
And when I slide my
arms into a wool coat

00:29:36.940 --> 00:29:39.640
and put my hand
to the door knob,

00:29:39.640 --> 00:29:43.210
ready to brave
the sub-zero dark,

00:29:43.210 --> 00:29:46.990
someone says, be
careful out there.

00:29:46.990 --> 00:29:53.240
Always consider the
snow your friend.

00:29:53.240 --> 00:29:59.010
Think badly of it,
snow will burn you.

00:29:59.010 --> 00:30:02.740
I walk out remembering
that for millennia, we

00:30:02.740 --> 00:30:08.455
have called ourselves Lakota,
meaning "friend or ally."

00:30:11.830 --> 00:30:18.620
This relationship to the
other, some but not all,

00:30:18.620 --> 00:30:23.099
still our piece to everything."

00:30:30.090 --> 00:30:35.250
When I was working
on this response,

00:30:35.250 --> 00:30:42.880
I started researching apologies
around the world, even

00:30:42.880 --> 00:30:44.490
other US apologies.

00:30:44.490 --> 00:30:48.330
There was a whole apology
to native Hawaiian people,

00:30:48.330 --> 00:30:50.370
for example.

00:30:50.370 --> 00:30:55.590
There was an apology, in
Canada, to First Nations

00:30:55.590 --> 00:30:59.370
people for the residential
schools and so on.

00:30:59.370 --> 00:31:01.920
So that was something I
was thinking about a lot,

00:31:01.920 --> 00:31:03.650
meditating on.

00:31:03.650 --> 00:31:09.070
And then I also thought a lot
about apologies in my own life.

00:31:09.070 --> 00:31:12.078
And I wrote this piece.

00:31:12.078 --> 00:31:13.710
This is, actually,
I would consider

00:31:13.710 --> 00:31:16.870
the heart of this book.

00:31:16.870 --> 00:31:21.000
It was probably the
most effective apology

00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:24.160
I've ever had.

00:31:24.160 --> 00:31:25.320
And this is about my dad.

00:31:39.740 --> 00:31:46.430
"Whereas I heard a noise
I thought was a sneeze.

00:31:46.430 --> 00:31:51.320
At the breakfast table,
pushing eggs around my plate,

00:31:51.320 --> 00:31:54.560
I wondered if he liked
my cooking, thought

00:31:54.560 --> 00:31:58.140
about what to talk about.

00:31:58.140 --> 00:32:02.070
He pinched his fingers to
the bridge of his nose,

00:32:02.070 --> 00:32:04.200
squeezed his eyes.

00:32:04.200 --> 00:32:04.790
He wiped.

00:32:07.760 --> 00:32:13.650
I often say he was a terrible
drinker when I was a child.

00:32:13.650 --> 00:32:17.570
I'm not afraid to say it,
because he's different now,

00:32:17.570 --> 00:32:24.370
sober, attentive,
showered, eating.

00:32:24.370 --> 00:32:28.380
But in my childhood, when
things were different,

00:32:28.380 --> 00:32:35.040
I rolled onto my side, my
hands together, as if to pray,

00:32:35.040 --> 00:32:36.585
locked between my knees.

00:32:39.740 --> 00:32:41.930
When things were
different, I lay there

00:32:41.930 --> 00:32:47.890
for long hours, my face
to the wall, blink.

00:32:47.890 --> 00:32:55.700
My eyes left me, my soldiers,
my two scouts to the unseen.

00:32:55.700 --> 00:33:00.800
And because language
is the immaterial,

00:33:00.800 --> 00:33:05.980
I never could speak
about the missing,

00:33:05.980 --> 00:33:09.910
so perhaps I cried for
the invisible, what

00:33:09.910 --> 00:33:14.420
I could not see, doubly.

00:33:14.420 --> 00:33:18.695
What is it to wish for
the absence of nothing?

00:33:22.120 --> 00:33:25.180
There, at the breakfast
table, as an adult

00:33:25.180 --> 00:33:29.920
wondering what to talk about,
if he liked my cooking, pushing

00:33:29.920 --> 00:33:32.950
the invisible to
the plate's edge,

00:33:32.950 --> 00:33:37.060
I looked up to see
he hadn't sneezed.

00:33:37.060 --> 00:33:37.840
He was crying.

00:33:40.370 --> 00:33:46.830
I'd never heard him cry,
didn't recognize the symptoms.

00:33:46.830 --> 00:33:49.650
I turned to him when
I heard him say,

00:33:49.650 --> 00:33:58.930
I'm sorry I wasn't there,
sorry for many things.

00:33:58.930 --> 00:34:09.560
Like that curative
voicing, an opened bundle

00:34:09.560 --> 00:34:22.000
or medicine or birthday wishing,
my hand to his shoulder.

00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:23.560
It's OK, I said.

00:34:23.560 --> 00:34:24.969
It's over now.

00:34:24.969 --> 00:34:25.760
I meant it.

00:34:28.480 --> 00:34:37.250
Because of our faces blankly,
because of a lifelong stare

00:34:37.250 --> 00:34:43.234
down, because of
centuries in sorry."

00:34:58.430 --> 00:35:00.340
You guys want to
hear my mad poem?

00:35:09.950 --> 00:35:13.040
When I get mad, it's really
hard for me to say anything,

00:35:13.040 --> 00:35:14.539
sometimes, right in the moment.

00:35:14.539 --> 00:35:15.080
I don't know.

00:35:15.080 --> 00:35:16.810
I'm so slow, too.

00:35:16.810 --> 00:35:20.690
You know, like I can't think
on my feet all the time.

00:35:20.690 --> 00:35:25.100
I have to go home and
like stew in it, you know?

00:35:25.100 --> 00:35:26.720
And then I come up
with the perfect--

00:35:26.720 --> 00:35:28.970
so then I just write about it.

00:35:28.970 --> 00:35:31.365
So that's my way of getting mad.

00:35:31.365 --> 00:35:32.545
I'm really mad.

00:35:32.545 --> 00:35:36.181
[TYPING SOUNDS] [LAUGHS]
I'll write a poem.

00:35:42.470 --> 00:35:43.860
Shall I read my mad poem?

00:35:43.860 --> 00:35:46.700
[LAUGHS] It's best
you get, sorry.

00:35:51.930 --> 00:36:01.400
"Whereas a string-bean
blue-eyed man leans back

00:36:01.400 --> 00:36:09.410
into a swig of beer, work-weary
lips at the dark bottle,

00:36:09.410 --> 00:36:13.190
keeping cool in short
sleeves and khakis,

00:36:13.190 --> 00:36:15.790
he enters the discussion.

00:36:20.960 --> 00:36:27.030
Whereas his wrist loose
at the bottleneck,

00:36:27.030 --> 00:36:30.490
he comes across as candid.

00:36:30.490 --> 00:36:40.870
Well, at least there was an
Apology, that's all I can say,

00:36:40.870 --> 00:36:45.140
he offers to the circle,
each of them scholarly.

00:36:50.840 --> 00:36:57.220
Whereas under
starlight, the fireflies

00:36:57.220 --> 00:37:00.700
wink across East Coast grass."

00:37:00.700 --> 00:37:02.688
Yes, I was on the East Coast.

00:37:02.688 --> 00:37:04.520
[LAUGHS]

00:37:06.810 --> 00:37:12.870
"I sit there, painful in my
silence, glued to the bench,

00:37:12.870 --> 00:37:15.555
in the midst of the
American casual.

00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:31.010
Whereas a subtle electricity
in that low purple light,

00:37:31.010 --> 00:37:37.080
I felt their eyes on my
face gauging a reaction.

00:37:37.080 --> 00:37:43.164
And someone's discomfort leaks
out in a well-stated, hmm.

00:37:49.070 --> 00:37:55.230
Whereas like a bird darting
from an oncoming semi,

00:37:55.230 --> 00:38:01.210
my mind races to the
Apology's assertion."

00:38:01.210 --> 00:38:06.680
Quote-- so this is from
the National apology.

00:38:06.680 --> 00:38:11.480
"While the establishment of
permanent European settlements

00:38:11.480 --> 00:38:15.590
in North America
did stir conflict

00:38:15.590 --> 00:38:20.140
with nearby Indian
tribes, peaceful

00:38:20.140 --> 00:38:25.975
and mutually beneficial
interactions also took place.

00:38:32.170 --> 00:38:39.830
Whereas I cross my arms
and raise a curled hand

00:38:39.830 --> 00:38:42.920
to my mouth, as if thinking.

00:38:42.920 --> 00:38:51.410
As if taking it in, I
allow a static quiet,

00:38:51.410 --> 00:38:53.360
then choose to stand up.

00:38:53.360 --> 00:38:58.340
Excusing myself, I
leave them to unease.

00:39:03.050 --> 00:39:08.840
Whereas I drive down the road
replaying the get-together,

00:39:08.840 --> 00:39:14.600
how a man and his beer
bottle stated their piece.

00:39:14.600 --> 00:39:19.250
And I reel at what I could
have said or done better.

00:39:24.170 --> 00:39:29.390
Whereas I could've
but didn't broach

00:39:29.390 --> 00:39:36.310
the subject of "genocide,"
the absence of this term

00:39:36.310 --> 00:39:40.000
from the Apology
and it's rephrasing

00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:43.055
as "conflict" for example.

00:39:47.530 --> 00:39:54.150
Whereas since the moment had
passed, I accept what's done.

00:39:54.150 --> 00:39:59.370
And the knife of my
conscience slices

00:39:59.370 --> 00:40:01.725
with bone-clean self-honesty.

00:40:06.690 --> 00:40:12.000
Whereas in a stirred conflict
between settlers and an Indian

00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:13.650
that night in a circle.

00:40:19.030 --> 00:40:24.790
Whereas I struggle to
confess that I didn't

00:40:24.790 --> 00:40:27.155
want to explain anything.

00:40:32.210 --> 00:40:41.480
Whereas truthfully I wished most
to kick the legs of that man's

00:40:41.480 --> 00:40:44.440
chair out from under him.

00:40:48.140 --> 00:40:53.690
Whereas to watch him fall
backward, legs flailing,

00:40:53.690 --> 00:40:56.195
beer stench across his chest.

00:41:02.160 --> 00:41:09.410
Whereas I pictured it happening
in cinematic slow-motion,

00:41:09.410 --> 00:41:10.270
delightful.

00:41:15.510 --> 00:41:20.570
Whereas the curled
hand I held to my mouth

00:41:20.570 --> 00:41:22.590
was a sign of indecision.

00:41:28.180 --> 00:41:31.590
Whereas I could have
done it, but I didn't.

00:41:37.250 --> 00:41:46.255
Whereas I can admit that also
took place, yes, at least."

00:41:53.930 --> 00:41:57.070
I'm going to close
with this last piece.

00:41:57.070 --> 00:42:02.380
This is a piece that
I usually close with.

00:42:02.380 --> 00:42:09.570
It is a resolution from the
last section, "Resolution 2."

00:42:09.570 --> 00:42:15.130
And in the resolutions,
I have used the text

00:42:15.130 --> 00:42:16.480
from the actual apology.

00:42:16.480 --> 00:42:18.170
I hope I'm OK on time.

00:42:18.170 --> 00:42:18.801
How?

00:42:18.801 --> 00:42:19.300
OK.

00:42:23.460 --> 00:42:27.910
So I have used the text from
the actual "Resolution 2"

00:42:27.910 --> 00:42:31.800
in the apology and sort
of reworked it as my own.

00:42:38.480 --> 00:42:55.330
"I commend this
land and this land

00:42:55.330 --> 00:43:27.896
honor this land Native this land
peoples this land for this land

00:43:27.896 --> 00:43:52.040
the this land thousands

protected this land this land

00:44:54.040 --> 00:44:59.376
this land this this."

00:44:59.376 --> 00:45:00.364
Thank you.

00:45:00.364 --> 00:45:19.136
[APPLAUSE]

00:45:25.100 --> 00:45:27.240
- So thank you.

00:45:27.240 --> 00:45:30.780
That was really
beautiful and amazing.

00:45:30.780 --> 00:45:33.520
We're going to open it
up for some questions.

00:45:33.520 --> 00:45:37.830
But first, I just wanted to
offer some brief reflections

00:45:37.830 --> 00:45:41.400
on this book but
also the reading.

00:45:41.400 --> 00:45:45.510
And you had talked about the
2010 apology resolution, which

00:45:45.510 --> 00:45:51.240
was folded into a 1,000
page tome, National Defense

00:45:51.240 --> 00:45:55.320
Authorization Act, which I
believe totaled somewhere

00:45:55.320 --> 00:45:59.970
around $685 billion for national
defense, which, at the time,

00:45:59.970 --> 00:46:04.560
was the largest
defense appropriations

00:46:04.560 --> 00:46:07.880
bill, not just in US history
but in world history.

00:46:07.880 --> 00:46:11.040
And so I think there is of a lot
of tension that you bring out,

00:46:11.040 --> 00:46:14.490
in this idea that
this apology is folded

00:46:14.490 --> 00:46:19.350
in with a sort of military
defense appropriations bill,

00:46:19.350 --> 00:46:23.370
but, also, that it was
signed into law by President

00:46:23.370 --> 00:46:29.700
Obama at the same time
that he reversed the US

00:46:29.700 --> 00:46:35.040
decision or the US vote
against the UN Declaration

00:46:35.040 --> 00:46:37.170
on the Rights of
Indigenous Peoples.

00:46:37.170 --> 00:46:41.790
And he accepted the UNDRIP,
as we call it for short,

00:46:41.790 --> 00:46:43.890
on the condition that
it was non-binding.

00:46:43.890 --> 00:46:46.560
And so in the language of
the apology resolution,

00:46:46.560 --> 00:46:50.010
there's this tension of a
non-binding sort of aspect,

00:46:50.010 --> 00:46:53.190
that there will not be
redistribution of land

00:46:53.190 --> 00:46:57.535
or the restoration
of things lost.

00:46:57.535 --> 00:46:59.160
And so, as you were
reading, I was kind

00:46:59.160 --> 00:47:01.140
of thinking about this tension.

00:47:01.140 --> 00:47:04.080
And you were you were
talking about apologies.

00:47:04.080 --> 00:47:07.860
And it got me thinking
about Crow Dog,

00:47:07.860 --> 00:47:14.040
for example Ex parte Crow Dog,
in which Crow Dog murdered

00:47:14.040 --> 00:47:18.090
Spotted Tail and then made
restitution, for his family,

00:47:18.090 --> 00:47:20.100
for the taking of a relative.

00:47:20.100 --> 00:47:22.620
And then the US government
stepped in and said,

00:47:22.620 --> 00:47:24.330
we have jurisdiction.

00:47:24.330 --> 00:47:26.640
And this apology
is null and void,

00:47:26.640 --> 00:47:32.407
and thus we got the Major
Crimes Act in 1887--

00:47:32.407 --> 00:47:33.740
I can't remember the exact year.

00:47:33.740 --> 00:47:38.349
I'm a historian, but, [LAUGHS]
I know, it's really bad.

00:47:38.349 --> 00:47:40.890
But I was just thinking about
all of these things and the way

00:47:40.890 --> 00:47:45.030
that your book is really
speaking to these things.

00:47:45.030 --> 00:47:49.230
And you had told me, in a
conversation just a little

00:47:49.230 --> 00:47:54.600
bit ago, that I'm trained in
the certainty of documents,

00:47:54.600 --> 00:48:01.500
whereas you are sort of open
to not knowing and feeling.

00:48:01.500 --> 00:48:03.900
And so I just
wanted to maybe ask

00:48:03.900 --> 00:48:05.400
you to reflect on
that a little bit

00:48:05.400 --> 00:48:09.000
and the readings
that you just gave,

00:48:09.000 --> 00:48:12.150
and this notion of apology
and reconciliation,

00:48:12.150 --> 00:48:17.596
if there was no
conciliation to begin with.

00:48:17.596 --> 00:48:18.558
- Hmm?

00:48:18.558 --> 00:48:20.001
[LAUGHTER]

00:48:20.001 --> 00:48:24.970
There's like a few
different things

00:48:24.970 --> 00:48:26.460
to address there at once.

00:48:30.820 --> 00:48:33.370
Right.

00:48:33.370 --> 00:48:38.320
Well, maybe I'll talk
a bit about the work.

00:48:38.320 --> 00:48:41.680
I'll talk about what I know,
which is the work of the poet.

00:48:41.680 --> 00:48:44.170
And even at that, I
know a little bit.

00:48:44.170 --> 00:48:46.520
[LAUGHS] There's so much more.

00:48:52.800 --> 00:48:56.130
So when it came to,
let's say, this aspect

00:48:56.130 --> 00:49:00.750
of this particular document
that I was working with,

00:49:00.750 --> 00:49:05.690
which was this national
apology, there are so

00:49:05.690 --> 00:49:07.760
many ways to approach it.

00:49:07.760 --> 00:49:11.060
But I think that's one of the
things we were talking about

00:49:11.060 --> 00:49:12.755
in your office, earlier.

00:49:18.500 --> 00:49:21.920
All of us in the community
have different ways of working

00:49:21.920 --> 00:49:24.440
and the jobs that we're doing.

00:49:24.440 --> 00:49:28.950
So I am not an
essayist, for example.

00:49:28.950 --> 00:49:30.590
I'm not a historian.

00:49:30.590 --> 00:49:34.970
In fact, I have a piece in here
where I clearly state, bear

00:49:34.970 --> 00:49:38.360
in mind, I am not
a historian, right?

00:49:38.360 --> 00:49:42.020
I make that crystal
clear, because I

00:49:42.020 --> 00:49:49.400
know the tendency of readers
to take any particular story

00:49:49.400 --> 00:49:52.090
and make it THE story.

00:49:52.090 --> 00:49:54.990
There is a great danger in that.

00:49:54.990 --> 00:49:58.170
This is one telling
and one perspective.

00:49:58.170 --> 00:50:00.030
And it's from a poet, at that.

00:50:00.030 --> 00:50:02.165
So poets are like, hmm?

00:50:02.165 --> 00:50:03.770
You know you have to give that--

00:50:03.770 --> 00:50:08.010
[LAUGHS] We have our ways of
telling, telling its slant,

00:50:08.010 --> 00:50:08.510
right?

00:50:12.160 --> 00:50:14.980
But I think like with this--

00:50:14.980 --> 00:50:17.650
and so given that,
as an artist, I

00:50:17.650 --> 00:50:26.920
think I had to think
of how could I approach

00:50:26.920 --> 00:50:30.310
this great document, how
could I approach anything that

00:50:30.310 --> 00:50:38.620
was directly political
that in a way

00:50:38.620 --> 00:50:40.240
that worked for me as an artist?

00:50:40.240 --> 00:50:43.210
Because I'm not a legal expert.

00:50:43.210 --> 00:50:46.420
Even sitting here, and you
are giving this little account

00:50:46.420 --> 00:50:50.080
of Crow Dog and Spotted Tail.

00:50:50.080 --> 00:50:52.210
I was like, wow, this is great.

00:50:52.210 --> 00:50:55.230
I could just sit here,
and you could give a talk.

00:50:55.230 --> 00:50:56.660
I just loved it.

00:50:56.660 --> 00:50:59.500
So there's so much that each--

00:50:59.500 --> 00:51:03.470
different kinds of knowledge
that each of us carries, right?

00:51:03.470 --> 00:51:05.230
But, of course, there's that--

00:51:05.230 --> 00:51:11.300
I've heard that common
saying, if mankind

00:51:11.300 --> 00:51:17.660
were a body, a physical body,
poets would be the skin.

00:51:17.660 --> 00:51:19.430
We're the ones who feel.

00:51:19.430 --> 00:51:20.310
So we feel.

00:51:20.310 --> 00:51:24.830
And that's part of what I
think my job is, as a poet,

00:51:24.830 --> 00:51:26.020
as an artist.

00:51:26.020 --> 00:51:28.940
I am here to feel for you.

00:51:28.940 --> 00:51:35.000
So I had maybe a basic
structure to work with,

00:51:35.000 --> 00:51:36.230
this legal document.

00:51:36.230 --> 00:51:39.732
But it is my job to--

00:51:39.732 --> 00:51:46.890
I felt like I wanted to enter
it in a way of thinking about,

00:51:46.890 --> 00:51:49.990
how does this make me feel?

00:51:49.990 --> 00:51:52.680
How does this
language make me feel?

00:51:52.680 --> 00:51:56.340
Even the "Resolutions,"
which are not anecdotal,

00:51:56.340 --> 00:52:01.470
necessarily-- like all of the
"Whereas" pieces, most of them

00:52:01.470 --> 00:52:05.880
are prose blocks,
and a lot of them

00:52:05.880 --> 00:52:10.930
are anecdotes from my own life.

00:52:10.930 --> 00:52:11.860
That's one thing.

00:52:11.860 --> 00:52:16.765
But even the "Resolutions,"
which are more visual pieces--

00:52:19.470 --> 00:52:23.640
you don't have the book, do
you, right in front of you?

00:52:23.640 --> 00:52:26.630
A lot of them are visual pieces.

00:52:26.630 --> 00:52:31.820
So, for example, I
even have one in here

00:52:31.820 --> 00:52:35.108
that is shaped like
a hammer, I think.

00:52:35.108 --> 00:52:36.450
Let me see.

00:52:36.450 --> 00:52:37.020
Where is it?

00:52:37.020 --> 00:52:39.020
Good lord, this is my
book, and I can't find it.

00:52:39.020 --> 00:52:41.030
Here it is.

00:52:41.030 --> 00:52:43.670
So I have a piece
that's like a hammer.

00:52:43.670 --> 00:52:50.690
But even those pieces,
I felt like my intention

00:52:50.690 --> 00:52:58.650
was to show what I feel how this
text affects me as a reader.

00:52:58.650 --> 00:53:02.350
And so then that's kind
of what I was doing.

00:53:02.350 --> 00:53:04.575
I don't even know if I
answered your question.

00:53:04.575 --> 00:53:06.120
Did I?

00:53:06.120 --> 00:53:10.430
- No, I think the
structure of the book,

00:53:10.430 --> 00:53:14.010
with the "whereas"
statements, and, for us,

00:53:14.010 --> 00:53:17.556
as historians, when
we read documents--

00:53:17.556 --> 00:53:18.930
in the resolution,
there's always

00:53:18.930 --> 00:53:21.990
the sort of preamble, which
is the whereas, the whereas,

00:53:21.990 --> 00:53:23.910
the whereas, the
whereas, setting up

00:53:23.910 --> 00:53:27.880
the reason for the resolution
in the first place.

00:53:27.880 --> 00:53:32.100
And so I guess, as somebody who
reads a lot of those documents,

00:53:32.100 --> 00:53:35.520
it was something that
really meant a lot.

00:53:35.520 --> 00:53:36.630
It was speaking to me.

00:53:36.630 --> 00:53:38.600
I felt like it was
speaking to me.

00:53:38.600 --> 00:53:40.140
And you and I had
this conversation

00:53:40.140 --> 00:53:44.100
about the idea of drawing
from collective memory

00:53:44.100 --> 00:53:47.347
and how we interpret
textual documents.

00:53:47.347 --> 00:53:48.930
And you had said
something that really

00:53:48.930 --> 00:53:52.860
stuck with me in the sense
that you do use Lakhotiyapi,

00:53:52.860 --> 00:53:56.610
or the Lakota language,
and that it's surrounded

00:53:56.610 --> 00:53:59.880
by English words on the page.

00:53:59.880 --> 00:54:03.210
And how these documents,
for us, whether it's

00:54:03.210 --> 00:54:06.360
treaties or agreements
that were made,

00:54:06.360 --> 00:54:10.470
were made orally, entirely
through the oral tradition,

00:54:10.470 --> 00:54:13.950
and were remembered that way.

00:54:13.950 --> 00:54:18.810
I don't know if you
want to speak to that.

00:54:18.810 --> 00:54:23.060
- Well, I think what you're
saying is very beautiful.

00:54:23.060 --> 00:54:25.550
And I want to spend
more time thinking

00:54:25.550 --> 00:54:29.800
about it, the orality
of these agreements.

00:54:29.800 --> 00:54:36.620
Only because I'm thinking
about when I taught at a tribal

00:54:36.620 --> 00:54:38.960
college, Diné College.

00:54:38.960 --> 00:54:40.700
I think I was talking,
earlier today,

00:54:40.700 --> 00:54:43.310
about teaching a reading class.

00:54:43.310 --> 00:54:48.290
That's one of the
main classes I taught.

00:54:48.290 --> 00:54:52.570
The very first thing that--

00:54:52.570 --> 00:54:54.720
and this was
fundamental reading.

00:54:54.720 --> 00:54:57.830
So it was a course to
kind of get students up

00:54:57.830 --> 00:55:01.010
to college-level reading.

00:55:01.010 --> 00:55:02.990
So we would dive in.

00:55:02.990 --> 00:55:04.300
And we read.

00:55:04.300 --> 00:55:07.880
I tried to have them read
different kinds of writing.

00:55:07.880 --> 00:55:13.750
The very first document we would
jump into was their treaty.

00:55:13.750 --> 00:55:16.510
And it was very
difficult language.

00:55:16.510 --> 00:55:19.730
In some ways, some of
it is archaic language.

00:55:19.730 --> 00:55:24.130
It's not language that we
use, some of the phrasing.

00:55:24.130 --> 00:55:26.230
And of course, it's
also legalese, kind

00:55:26.230 --> 00:55:28.630
of this governmental language.

00:55:28.630 --> 00:55:31.040
It's not easy for them.

00:55:31.040 --> 00:55:33.600
But I would say, it's OK.

00:55:33.600 --> 00:55:37.540
If it's not easy,
we'll take it slowly.

00:55:37.540 --> 00:55:42.820
And we'll do it, together, in
groups, article by article.

00:55:42.820 --> 00:55:45.100
You two, you take article one.

00:55:45.100 --> 00:55:47.830
That's all I want you to
do is read it together.

00:55:47.830 --> 00:55:49.300
And you come back.

00:55:49.300 --> 00:55:52.840
And you report to us
what you know about it.

00:55:52.840 --> 00:55:58.180
And then bring in examples
from your own family

00:55:58.180 --> 00:56:01.060
or your own knowledge,
something that applies

00:56:01.060 --> 00:56:02.860
to this particular article.

00:56:02.860 --> 00:56:05.750
And that's how we would take it.

00:56:05.750 --> 00:56:09.040
And one of the things we would
do, also, at the same time,

00:56:09.040 --> 00:56:12.470
is go online.

00:56:12.470 --> 00:56:16.410
And we would look up
the actual treaty.

00:56:16.410 --> 00:56:18.590
There's online archives,
and you can usually

00:56:18.590 --> 00:56:21.680
see the original documents.

00:56:21.680 --> 00:56:26.360
And we would go and look
at the very last page

00:56:26.360 --> 00:56:30.390
of the signatures
by the leaders.

00:56:30.390 --> 00:56:31.700
So we would go online.

00:56:31.700 --> 00:56:33.020
And this is Navajo Nation.

00:56:33.020 --> 00:56:38.961
This applies to ours, Treaty
of 1868, and what have you.

00:56:38.961 --> 00:56:39.960
And we would look at it.

00:56:39.960 --> 00:56:42.060
And I would say,
what do you notice

00:56:42.060 --> 00:56:45.330
about this, that all
of the leaders' names

00:56:45.330 --> 00:56:48.140
are listed and so on?

00:56:48.140 --> 00:56:50.760
But what's one of the
first things you notice?

00:56:50.760 --> 00:56:52.710
And sometimes it would be quiet.

00:56:52.710 --> 00:56:54.840
But anyway, the
point I was making

00:56:54.840 --> 00:57:01.560
is all of those signatures
are Xs, all of them.

00:57:01.560 --> 00:57:05.146
And that's us, too, up
north, they're all Xs.

00:57:05.146 --> 00:57:07.980
So that is the first thing
we would think about.

00:57:07.980 --> 00:57:11.490
And what are the
implications of that?

00:57:11.490 --> 00:57:12.944
What does that mean?

00:57:12.944 --> 00:57:15.110
When our grandfather-- and
I can say that some of us

00:57:15.110 --> 00:57:19.670
have grandfathers who
signed those agreements.

00:57:19.670 --> 00:57:21.140
What does that mean?

00:57:21.140 --> 00:57:24.965
We would have a whole
class on what the X means.

00:57:27.740 --> 00:57:31.360
You know, to see that?

00:57:31.360 --> 00:57:33.450
But really, then I
would say to them,

00:57:33.450 --> 00:57:35.870
OK, listen, we're at
a different time now.

00:57:35.870 --> 00:57:40.220
None of us have to be in
that position ever again.

00:57:40.220 --> 00:57:41.944
I don't want any of
us to be in that.

00:57:41.944 --> 00:57:43.610
So that's why we're
starting, right now,

00:57:43.610 --> 00:57:46.740
with your treaty, because
it's the place of power.

00:57:46.740 --> 00:57:49.896
Language is a place of power.

00:57:49.896 --> 00:57:53.071
Have the language
at your command.

00:57:53.071 --> 00:57:53.820
Now, I don't know.

00:57:53.820 --> 00:57:55.920
Did I answer your
question again?

00:57:55.920 --> 00:57:56.420
- You did.

00:57:56.420 --> 00:57:59.600
- Whoo, I went way off there.

00:57:59.600 --> 00:58:01.110
Oh, the verbal?

00:58:01.110 --> 00:58:02.840
The orality of it?

00:58:02.840 --> 00:58:03.680
[LAUGHTER]

00:58:03.680 --> 00:58:06.620
That is also what I'm
very interested in.

00:58:06.620 --> 00:58:08.880
- Because if you read
the treaty out loud,

00:58:08.880 --> 00:58:10.590
it sounds really wonky.

00:58:10.590 --> 00:58:13.320
I mean it doesn't
make a lot of sense.

00:58:13.320 --> 00:58:14.850
But I mean the way
that it's passed

00:58:14.850 --> 00:58:17.490
down, from generation
to generation,

00:58:17.490 --> 00:58:20.670
is that it was
translated into Lakota.

00:58:20.670 --> 00:58:24.070
Well, for us, it was translated
into Lakota and Diné bizaad

00:58:24.070 --> 00:58:26.760
for Navajo.

00:58:26.760 --> 00:58:28.650
And then it was
translated into English.

00:58:28.650 --> 00:58:30.960
And then it was re-translated
back into Lakota.

00:58:30.960 --> 00:58:33.000
And it would go back and forth.

00:58:33.000 --> 00:58:37.420
And we had an understanding
of what it meant.

00:58:37.420 --> 00:58:40.440
And then whether or not that
was what was finally written

00:58:40.440 --> 00:58:42.000
on paper, we had no idea.

00:58:42.000 --> 00:58:43.360
Because we couldn't read it.

00:58:43.360 --> 00:58:45.230
- Absolutely.

00:58:45.230 --> 00:58:49.680
And it makes me think
also of the Maori.

00:58:49.680 --> 00:58:51.190
This is what I understand.

00:58:51.190 --> 00:58:53.700
If my telling is
wrong, forgive me.

00:58:53.700 --> 00:58:56.790
But I used to work at
the Language Institute--

00:58:56.790 --> 00:59:01.470
no, the Indigenous Language
Institute for some years.

00:59:01.470 --> 00:59:07.260
And we had some people
from the institute

00:59:07.260 --> 00:59:13.380
visit the Maori people
to talk about how

00:59:13.380 --> 00:59:16.380
they were able to help
their language grow.

00:59:16.380 --> 00:59:21.745
In any case, one of the things
I learned from that visit--

00:59:21.745 --> 00:59:24.180
I was transcribing notes--

00:59:24.180 --> 00:59:31.860
is this renewal of Maori
rights, land rights,

00:59:31.860 --> 00:59:34.680
which came back to
their original agreement

00:59:34.680 --> 00:59:36.270
with the Crown.

00:59:36.270 --> 00:59:40.620
And it all came down to
the translation of one

00:59:40.620 --> 00:59:45.870
word, "sovereignty--" one word.

00:59:45.870 --> 00:59:49.740
And they were able,
these young Maori lawyers

00:59:49.740 --> 00:59:53.340
were able to come
and prove that there

00:59:53.340 --> 00:59:58.080
was no direct translation
into Maori language

00:59:58.080 --> 01:00:00.330
for that particular word.

01:00:00.330 --> 01:00:02.400
And there is no
way their leaders

01:00:02.400 --> 01:00:05.250
would have agreed to that.

01:00:05.250 --> 01:00:08.580
That is not a
concept, not something

01:00:08.580 --> 01:00:12.180
that is practiced in their
culture, complete sovereignty

01:00:12.180 --> 01:00:17.050
over a particular
area or what have you.

01:00:17.050 --> 01:00:17.994
So beautiful.

01:00:17.994 --> 01:00:20.160
And I was saying, I wish
we could do that, you know?

01:00:20.160 --> 01:00:23.370
But anyway, that's
another subject.

01:00:23.370 --> 01:00:25.242
- I just wanted to
ask one more thing,

01:00:25.242 --> 01:00:27.450
because I was thinking a
lot, as you were reading it.

01:00:27.450 --> 01:00:31.110
And it's much different to hear
you read the poetry than it

01:00:31.110 --> 01:00:34.060
is to read it on the page.

01:00:34.060 --> 01:00:36.870
And one thing that I
was reminded about--

01:00:36.870 --> 01:00:38.940
and we talked about
this in my office,

01:00:38.940 --> 01:00:41.730
but you actually read the piece,
the "Whereas" piece talking

01:00:41.730 --> 01:00:44.724
about Lakota meaning
"friend or ally."

01:00:44.724 --> 01:00:46.140
And in this case,
you were talking

01:00:46.140 --> 01:00:49.810
about a snowstorm and the cold.

01:00:49.810 --> 01:00:53.190
And you'll get burned if
you try to push against.

01:00:53.190 --> 01:00:55.680
And I was thinking
of this testimony

01:00:55.680 --> 01:00:59.880
given by Phyllis Young, who
is a council woman at Standing

01:00:59.880 --> 01:01:04.170
Rock, when the Dakota
Access Pipeline was meeting

01:01:04.170 --> 01:01:06.090
with the Standing
Rock Sioux tribe.

01:01:06.090 --> 01:01:07.660
And she said,
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH],,

01:01:07.660 --> 01:01:09.360
I am Dakota.

01:01:09.360 --> 01:01:11.730
Dakota means "friend or ally."

01:01:11.730 --> 01:01:15.630
And she was saying this to
the North Dakota officials,

01:01:15.630 --> 01:01:18.270
that you are not friends or
allies to the Dakota people.

01:01:18.270 --> 01:01:22.320
You are not friends or allies to
the land, and to Dakota Access,

01:01:22.320 --> 01:01:26.840
for taking the name of a
nation, to be against the land.

01:01:26.840 --> 01:01:30.272
And so I was just like, I'm
going to deep now [LAUGHS]

01:01:30.272 --> 01:01:32.100
into what you were writing.

01:01:32.100 --> 01:01:34.020
So I really, really
appreciated that.

01:01:36.570 --> 01:01:39.330
As we were talking
about, you're dealing

01:01:39.330 --> 01:01:40.700
with the tensions in language.

01:01:40.700 --> 01:01:44.104
And I think there's another
level of understanding.

01:01:44.104 --> 01:01:45.645
And here were talking
about the other

01:01:45.645 --> 01:01:49.230
than human element of
the Lakota language.

01:01:49.230 --> 01:01:50.058
- Yeah.

01:01:50.058 --> 01:01:55.530
Yeah, the relationship and
understanding that, right?

01:01:55.530 --> 01:02:00.750
As we were saying earlier, to
be an ally, to be a friend,

01:02:00.750 --> 01:02:03.718
extends far beyond
just a people.

01:02:03.718 --> 01:02:05.670
It is everything.

01:02:08.640 --> 01:02:11.320
We could talk about that
for a long time, yeah.

01:02:13.945 --> 01:02:15.570
- Should we open it
up to the audience?

01:02:15.570 --> 01:02:16.835
I don't know if there's--
is there a microphone?

01:02:16.835 --> 01:02:18.020
I can't-- OK.

01:02:18.020 --> 01:02:20.050
She's bringing it around.

01:02:20.050 --> 01:02:22.507
And I just want to
remind everyone,

01:02:22.507 --> 01:02:24.090
if you have a question,
please make it

01:02:24.090 --> 01:02:26.910
a question and not a statement.

01:02:26.910 --> 01:02:34.132
And also, try to keep it
relevant to the talk tonight.

01:02:34.132 --> 01:02:36.036
[LAUGHTER]

01:02:40.330 --> 01:02:43.500
- Thank you so much.

01:02:43.500 --> 01:02:46.950
My question is about the piece
you were just talking about,

01:02:46.950 --> 01:02:49.890
ally, friend, and
earlier in that piece

01:02:49.890 --> 01:02:52.590
you talked about part
in a way that struck me

01:02:52.590 --> 01:02:56.850
as being perhaps different
from what I have received

01:02:56.850 --> 01:03:00.360
as a European descended
person, which part, as a verb,

01:03:00.360 --> 01:03:02.490
means to sunder.

01:03:02.490 --> 01:03:06.870
And I think your part was in
many ways bringing together,

01:03:06.870 --> 01:03:09.030
sometimes bringing
together things named

01:03:09.030 --> 01:03:12.840
and sometimes bringing together
across something that I

01:03:12.840 --> 01:03:13.770
didn't understand.

01:03:13.770 --> 01:03:16.050
So I'm hoping I can
persuade you to talk

01:03:16.050 --> 01:03:17.370
about part a little bit.

01:03:24.990 --> 01:03:30.740
- I mean, I think
that, for me, it's just

01:03:30.740 --> 01:03:32.480
kind of like a sensibility.

01:03:35.570 --> 01:03:38.120
If anything, one of the
things that I appreciate

01:03:38.120 --> 01:03:44.390
most about Lakota
sensibility is this idea

01:03:44.390 --> 01:03:52.680
of being a part of
things, that all of us,

01:03:52.680 --> 01:03:59.090
in any doing or any effort,
we are all coming in.

01:03:59.090 --> 01:04:00.850
We're contributing something.

01:04:00.850 --> 01:04:03.200
We're a part of that.

01:04:07.550 --> 01:04:10.310
And I think the other
part, the other thing

01:04:10.310 --> 01:04:13.910
to that is always an
acknowledgment of everyone's

01:04:13.910 --> 01:04:14.410
part.

01:04:20.120 --> 01:04:21.950
I don't know.

01:04:21.950 --> 01:04:24.070
I'm losing my train
of thought here.

01:04:24.070 --> 01:04:28.360
I know that when I wrote
that piece, I mean,

01:04:28.360 --> 01:04:31.840
I was really just
meditating I guess.

01:04:31.840 --> 01:04:33.940
Because I had just
written the other piece

01:04:33.940 --> 01:04:36.520
about how we
understand ourselves

01:04:36.520 --> 01:04:40.270
as Indian or American Indian,
the dictionary, and so on.

01:04:40.270 --> 01:04:43.210
So in that regard, when I
began working on that piece,

01:04:43.210 --> 01:04:45.190
I was really
meditating on this idea

01:04:45.190 --> 01:04:50.260
of what it is to be Lakota,
yes, friend and ally.

01:04:50.260 --> 01:04:54.640
But I think it's also this
idea for me, at least,

01:04:54.640 --> 01:05:00.250
always that we are a part of
a greater whole, a community,

01:05:00.250 --> 01:05:02.770
a family, [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH].

01:05:02.770 --> 01:05:06.220
Like that is always how
we understand ourselves.

01:05:06.220 --> 01:05:12.330
It is not an existence that
is I, an alone existence,

01:05:12.330 --> 01:05:14.570
a very individual existence.

01:05:14.570 --> 01:05:19.130
No, it is an existence that
is always connected to others.

01:05:19.130 --> 01:05:22.490
And so, really, that's kind of
what I was getting at, I think.

01:05:22.490 --> 01:05:22.990
- Thank you.

01:05:28.821 --> 01:05:29.320
- Hi, there.

01:05:29.320 --> 01:05:31.580
Thank you for being here.

01:05:31.580 --> 01:05:34.940
Appreciated your acknowledgment
that you're not a historian.

01:05:34.940 --> 01:05:38.630
But I do think that your
poem "38" has the potential

01:05:38.630 --> 01:05:42.820
to really sear that incident
into our consciousness in a way

01:05:42.820 --> 01:05:44.552
nothing else has before.

01:05:44.552 --> 01:05:46.010
And I'm wondering
if you would just

01:05:46.010 --> 01:05:48.650
talk a little bit about
how that poem came to be

01:05:48.650 --> 01:05:51.246
and what was involved
in the writing of it.

01:05:51.246 --> 01:05:52.202
Thank you.

01:05:55.070 --> 01:05:59.870
- So I had heard that story
when I was much younger.

01:05:59.870 --> 01:06:02.450
It was kind of like a
verbal account, something

01:06:02.450 --> 01:06:04.550
I'd heard a long time ago.

01:06:04.550 --> 01:06:10.250
And it always stuck with me.

01:06:10.250 --> 01:06:15.530
And what was most
resonant about that story

01:06:15.530 --> 01:06:21.150
was the actual moment of
finding Andrew Myrick's body,

01:06:21.150 --> 01:06:23.720
and that, when they
found him, his mouth

01:06:23.720 --> 01:06:25.580
was stuffed with grass.

01:06:25.580 --> 01:06:35.990
That was the moment that
made a huge impression on me

01:06:35.990 --> 01:06:38.470
as a young person.

01:06:38.470 --> 01:06:44.120
So as I got older, I
mean, there came a point

01:06:44.120 --> 01:06:47.930
when I felt like I
really, really wanted to--

01:06:47.930 --> 01:06:49.970
I wanted to write about that.

01:06:49.970 --> 01:06:53.860
There was something
about it that was just,

01:06:53.860 --> 01:06:57.400
I mean, I guess
calling to me, like I

01:06:57.400 --> 01:06:59.330
needed to write about that.

01:06:59.330 --> 01:07:02.710
But I didn't know how.

01:07:02.710 --> 01:07:07.000
I didn't know how
to approach it.

01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:10.210
So that actually
took me a long time

01:07:10.210 --> 01:07:17.410
to really come to what
the best form would be

01:07:17.410 --> 01:07:19.840
and the best telling.

01:07:19.840 --> 01:07:25.390
So one of the things
I came to first

01:07:25.390 --> 01:07:28.690
was that the way I heard the
story, the telling I heard,

01:07:28.690 --> 01:07:31.040
was very straightforward.

01:07:31.040 --> 01:07:34.030
It didn't need a lot
of embellishment.

01:07:34.030 --> 01:07:39.650
Like just what happened was
enough to make an impact.

01:07:39.650 --> 01:07:43.420
So I realized, OK, that was
the first thing in that piece.

01:07:43.420 --> 01:07:49.120
I did not need to embellish
it and make it poety and even

01:07:49.120 --> 01:07:53.050
create a fictional
character or anything.

01:07:53.050 --> 01:07:53.950
I didn't need that.

01:07:53.950 --> 01:07:55.580
I didn't need to do that.

01:07:55.580 --> 01:07:58.930
So then I realized, OK,
the facts sometimes,

01:07:58.930 --> 01:08:02.410
just as they are, are enough.

01:08:02.410 --> 01:08:10.740
So that was an important
part of drafting that piece.

01:08:10.740 --> 01:08:16.270
I decided to have a very
straightforward, dry tone.

01:08:16.270 --> 01:08:20.890
And therefore, I decided
to have the sentence

01:08:20.890 --> 01:08:26.380
as the primary
carrier of the poem.

01:08:26.380 --> 01:08:32.020
And then, of course, there's
the dual meaning of sentence

01:08:32.020 --> 01:08:33.340
within that piece, right?

01:08:33.340 --> 01:08:36.160
You have the death
sentence and the sentence,

01:08:36.160 --> 01:08:39.805
the grammatical sentence.

01:08:42.710 --> 01:08:45.240
So that seemed to work well.

01:08:45.240 --> 01:08:49.290
And once I kind of got
myself into the form,

01:08:49.290 --> 01:08:52.380
then the wheels started moving.

01:08:52.380 --> 01:08:54.290
And I started researching.

01:08:54.290 --> 01:09:00.500
I read different
accounts of that moment.

01:09:00.500 --> 01:09:01.580
Some of them very--

01:09:01.580 --> 01:09:02.630
I say it in the piece.

01:09:02.630 --> 01:09:07.580
They're slightly different,
but they all kind of

01:09:07.580 --> 01:09:10.720
have the same telling.

01:09:10.720 --> 01:09:12.680
I mean they're
slightly different.

01:09:12.680 --> 01:09:15.140
There's a lot that I didn't--

01:09:15.140 --> 01:09:18.200
I had to be decisive in
what I would include.

01:09:18.200 --> 01:09:22.000
There were a lot of interesting
facts around that time

01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:24.439
that I did not include.

01:09:24.439 --> 01:09:26.880
It's already a six-page poem.

01:09:26.880 --> 01:09:32.930
So I had to, at some
point, pick and choose

01:09:32.930 --> 01:09:35.660
what was most important to me.

01:09:35.660 --> 01:09:41.560
And so part of that
process was readers.

01:09:41.560 --> 01:09:46.700
Once I had a draft
that was, I felt,

01:09:46.700 --> 01:09:49.120
kind of where I
wanted it to be, I

01:09:49.120 --> 01:09:54.470
had several native poets
and a Dakota writer--

01:09:54.470 --> 01:10:00.620
people that were, I felt,
knowledgeable and could give me

01:10:00.620 --> 01:10:02.780
good feedback--

01:10:02.780 --> 01:10:05.080
look at it.

01:10:05.080 --> 01:10:09.410
All together, that piece took
about two years to complete.

01:10:09.410 --> 01:10:13.340
So it was not a rush job.

01:10:13.340 --> 01:10:16.200
I wanted to get it right
if at all possible.

01:10:19.884 --> 01:10:22.100
- We have time for
one more question.

01:10:28.510 --> 01:10:29.010
- Hi.

01:10:29.010 --> 01:10:32.130
Thank you so much.

01:10:32.130 --> 01:10:36.180
So when you were answering
Nick's second question,

01:10:36.180 --> 01:10:40.230
it made me think about
how much of your book

01:10:40.230 --> 01:10:43.380
is kind of about translation.

01:10:43.380 --> 01:10:46.680
So there are the poems
near the beginning

01:10:46.680 --> 01:10:53.850
of the book, where you're sort
of unpacking Lakota words.

01:10:53.850 --> 01:10:58.890
And then the "Whereas"
section is basically

01:10:58.890 --> 01:11:04.740
translating the apology
from government into human.

01:11:04.740 --> 01:11:08.730
And that made me
think about something

01:11:08.730 --> 01:11:15.360
you said earlier, where you
said the poet's job is to feel.

01:11:15.360 --> 01:11:21.600
And I guess the two things sort
of smushed together in my head.

01:11:21.600 --> 01:11:25.680
And so, basically,
I thought maybe

01:11:25.680 --> 01:11:29.940
that's implying that a poet's
job is to translate reality

01:11:29.940 --> 01:11:32.580
into feeling.

01:11:32.580 --> 01:11:38.040
And that connected to something
from the first or second poem

01:11:38.040 --> 01:11:40.020
that you read, where
you were talking

01:11:40.020 --> 01:11:44.070
about feeling in your poem
and how feeling is something

01:11:44.070 --> 01:11:46.590
with the senses, with the body.

01:11:46.590 --> 01:11:51.780
So my question is, when
you're writing a poem,

01:11:51.780 --> 01:11:59.310
when you're feeling, do you
have a sense that you use more?

01:11:59.310 --> 01:12:02.130
Do you see a poem more
or do you hear it?

01:12:04.870 --> 01:12:05.803
- Oh.

01:12:05.803 --> 01:12:06.770
Uh-huh.

01:12:06.770 --> 01:12:09.122
[LAUGHTER]

01:12:14.550 --> 01:12:16.180
Yeah, that's interesting.

01:12:16.180 --> 01:12:19.090
OK.

01:12:19.090 --> 01:12:20.030
OK.

01:12:20.030 --> 01:12:21.580
I'm going to come--

01:12:21.580 --> 01:12:23.620
first, I'm going to say
something that is not

01:12:23.620 --> 01:12:26.980
quite an answer, but it is.

01:12:26.980 --> 01:12:33.550
First, I will say, often, with
students that I'm working with,

01:12:33.550 --> 01:12:39.430
I will say, for
me, art or poetry

01:12:39.430 --> 01:12:43.480
is a way of thinking out loud.

01:12:43.480 --> 01:12:46.360
So you would think that
thinking and feeling

01:12:46.360 --> 01:12:53.430
are in contrast to each
other, but they're not.

01:12:53.430 --> 01:12:56.520
For me, it's the same.

01:12:56.520 --> 01:12:59.640
But it is a way of
thinking out loud.

01:12:59.640 --> 01:13:03.390
These poems are my
way of thinking.

01:13:03.390 --> 01:13:10.730
So the piece I read, about being
a child and sitting on my side

01:13:10.730 --> 01:13:16.920
and thinking, laying like this,
that was an activity for me

01:13:16.920 --> 01:13:17.610
as a child.

01:13:17.610 --> 01:13:20.220
[LAUGHS] That was
like, I did that.

01:13:20.220 --> 01:13:21.930
Like that was so weird.

01:13:21.930 --> 01:13:24.210
But it was like
actually a thing.

01:13:24.210 --> 01:13:27.780
And it wasn't until I got
older that I said, oh, my god,

01:13:27.780 --> 01:13:32.880
there's actually a use for
that, which is something

01:13:32.880 --> 01:13:34.320
that I have done all my life.

01:13:34.320 --> 01:13:41.010
So I'll sit and ponder
the word "circuitous."

01:13:41.010 --> 01:13:42.240
Like what's up with that?

01:13:42.240 --> 01:13:44.760
I think it's such a
beautiful word, you know?

01:13:44.760 --> 01:13:45.890
And here we go.

01:13:45.890 --> 01:13:47.160
I became.

01:13:47.160 --> 01:13:51.600
I have a piece where circuitous
had to be in that piece.

01:13:51.600 --> 01:13:53.742
I wrote the whole
piece for that word.

01:13:53.742 --> 01:13:55.350
[LAUGHS]

01:13:55.350 --> 01:13:57.370
Because it needed to be there.

01:13:57.370 --> 01:13:58.170
There's a sound.

01:13:58.170 --> 01:14:00.240
So now let's get to the senses.

01:14:00.240 --> 01:14:04.280
There is a sound, a sound
that is pleasing to me.

01:14:04.280 --> 01:14:06.640
And I want to unravel that.

01:14:06.640 --> 01:14:09.540
I wrote a whole piece
on the word "opaque."

01:14:09.540 --> 01:14:12.420
Because, for years, I thought
opaque might see-through,

01:14:12.420 --> 01:14:14.125
the opposite, right?

01:14:14.125 --> 01:14:21.420
And I was very upset to
learn it was not see-through.

01:14:21.420 --> 01:14:26.500
And I sat and pondered why did
I think opaque means see-through

01:14:26.500 --> 01:14:27.270
all these years?

01:14:27.270 --> 01:14:29.220
And it was the sound.

01:14:29.220 --> 01:14:34.990
It sounds-- oh, pee, ay,
kay-- let's say, a kah.

01:14:38.280 --> 01:14:41.670
I dissected that in
the poem to understand

01:14:41.670 --> 01:14:47.940
how those sounds translated
to mean see-through to me.

01:14:47.940 --> 01:14:52.180
So maybe it's a combination
of all those things

01:14:52.180 --> 01:14:53.140
I'm working with.

01:14:53.140 --> 01:14:56.820
A lot of sound now that I'm
talking to you about it, yeah.

01:14:56.820 --> 01:14:57.992
- Thank you.

01:14:57.992 --> 01:15:00.760
- Thank you.

01:15:00.760 --> 01:15:05.610
- So that concludes
the discussion.

01:15:05.610 --> 01:15:10.140
And I just want to thank Layli,
again, for coming out here.

01:15:10.140 --> 01:15:14.000
It's such a gift for everyone,
the book as well as the talk.

01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:15.500
And so [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH].

01:15:15.500 --> 01:15:17.000
- Oh, thank you.

01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:31.150
[APPLAUSE]
