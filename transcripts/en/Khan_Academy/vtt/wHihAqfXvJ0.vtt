00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:02.580
- [Instructor] We are
told a seal and a penguin

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:04.760
are playing a fun game of catch.

00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:07.860
The penguin swims leftward nine meters

00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:10.790
then dodges rightwards another 12 meters.

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:14.320
The penguin swims a total
time of eight seconds.

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:16.090
So goes to the left for nine meters

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:18.960
and then it goes to the
right for 12 meters.

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:21.950
What is the penguin's average
velocity during the chase?

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:23.890
And they say answer
using a coordinate system

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:27.010
where rightward is
positive and round answer

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:28.970
to two significant digits,

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:30.630
or really we should be
rounding our answers

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:32.720
to two significant digits.

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:34.230
So pause this video and
see if you can figure out

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:37.250
the penguin's average
velocity during the chase.

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:39.780
All right so let's just think about it.

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:42.620
Our average velocity right over here,

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:44.630
it is a vector quantity,
sometimes you will see it

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:45.600
written like that,

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.330
but sometimes when we're
thinking about one-dimensional

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:49.360
vectors people don't bother with it.

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:52.160
And our whether we talk about
a positive or negative sign,

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:53.910
that tells us our direction.

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:56.130
But this is going to be
equal to our displacement

00:00:56.130 --> 00:00:58.310
divided by the elapsed time,

00:00:58.310 --> 00:01:01.270
displacement divided

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:03.630
by our time.

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:06.460
And so what is our displacement?

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:08.540
Well we go nine to the left,

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:10.640
and remember our convention
is that the left is negative,

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:13.070
so it's gonna be negative nine meters,

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:16.610
plus 12 meters to the right,
12 meters to the right,

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:20.190
all of that our elapsed
time of eight seconds.

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:22.180
And what's this going to be equal to?

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:26.100
Well negative nine plus 12
is a net of positive three

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:29.570
over eight, and our units of
course are meters per second.

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:31.460
So 3/8 of a meter per second.

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:33.890
But they want us to go to
two significant digits,

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:35.791
so I'll write it as a decimal.

00:01:35.791 --> 00:01:40.791
3/8 is the same thing as 0.375,

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:43.520
but since they want us to round
to two significant digits,

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:48.510
I'll just say 0.38 meters per second.

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:51.130
That is the penguin's average velocity

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:52.240
during the chase.

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:54.230
It would be approximately
this right over here

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:57.000
if we round to two significant digits.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.800
But now let's think
about this next question.

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:02.710
What is the penguin's average
speed during the chase?

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:05.730
Pause this video again and see
if you can work through that.

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:08.290
All right now let's do it together.

00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:10.840
So our average speed,

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:13.020
and we'll use r for rate sometimes,

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:15.340
which could be used for speed,

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:16.570
our average speed.

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:19.010
Instead of displacement
divided by elapsed time,

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:20.652
we're gonna be thinking about distance

00:02:20.652 --> 00:02:24.650
divided by elapsed time.

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:27.200
And with distance we don't
care about the direction,

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:28.950
we just care about the magnitude.

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:30.550
So we go nine meters to the left

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:33.800
plus 12 meters to the right.

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:35.970
One way to think about
it is the absolute value

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:38.290
of each of these values up here.

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:41.050
And then we're gonna divide
that by our elapsed time.

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:45.720
And so this is going to
be equal to 21 over eight

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:47.210
meters per second.

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:49.970
And let's see 21 over eight

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:52.440
is equal to eight goes into 21 two times,

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:54.840
you have five left over, 2 5/8.

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:58.240
5/8 as a decimal is .625.

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:00.260
So this is gonna be equal to 2.625.

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:04.830
If they want us to round
to two significant digits,

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:05.730
it's gonna be 2.6.

00:03:06.906 --> 00:03:10.820
So it's gonna be approximately
2.6 meters per second,

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:11.653
and we're done.
