00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:04.059
PRESENTER: This shot was
taken on October 10, 2010.

00:00:04.059 --> 00:00:05.210
And so was this.

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:05.880
And this.

00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:07.010
And this.

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:09.480
There is really nothing
else unifying these scenes--

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:12.160
only the fact that they were
captured on the same day

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:13.700
all over the world.

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:16.140
And according to the guy that
brought all these vignettes

00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:18.655
together, that's
exactly the point.

00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:24.930
KYLE RUDDICK: I described
"One Day on Earth"

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:30.090
as a community and movement
to document the world,

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:35.350
to share things that matter, and
a participatory media concept

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:40.300
and experiment where anyone
can basically tell a story,

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:42.996
and the collective
stories that we all tell.

00:00:45.684 --> 00:00:47.350
PRESENTER: That's
filmmaker Kyle Ruddick

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:50.300
describing his brainchild,
"One Day on Earth."

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:53.550
The idea was to find a filmmaker
in every single country

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:55.900
in the world, and to
collect from each of them

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:57.380
a moment in their day.

00:00:57.380 --> 00:01:01.070
And even in 2010, that every
country in the world part

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:02.206
was a real challenge.

00:01:02.206 --> 00:01:04.330
KYLE RUDDICK: There's a
lot of the world where just

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:07.110
even getting a video
or a photograph from

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:08.470
is actually a lot of work.

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:10.560
How represented are they
in the global picture?

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.490
They're really not as
much as you'd think.

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:15.780
PRESENTER: Though once the
project gained some steam,

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.210
Kyle had help.

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.990
KYLE RUDDICK: The United
Nations and the Red Cross

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:25.290
and all sorts of other
humanitarian organizations.

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:28.240
And these really came
into play big-time

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:31.166
in the places around the world
where there's no bandwidth.

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:39.250
PRESENTER: Technical hurdles
overcome, the footage flowed

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:42.420
in, to the tune of 3,000 hours.

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:46.040
A real picture of October
10, 2010, emerged.

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:47.600
And with it came
everything you'd

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:50.504
expect from "One Day on Earth."

00:01:50.504 --> 00:01:51.390
Excitement.

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:52.610
Fun.

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:53.670
Danger.

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:54.820
Sorrow.

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:55.628
Joy.

00:01:55.628 --> 00:01:56.840
Hope.

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:58.960
And everything in between.

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:00.420
And ultimately,
there's a feeling

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:03.645
Kyle keeps returning
to-- connection.

00:02:03.645 --> 00:02:06.020
KYLE RUDDICK: The world's
never been so connected before.

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:08.780
But we're just crossing
this thresholds

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:11.150
of like what's it
like when people

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:13.850
in every country in the world
do something at the same time,

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:15.470
or work on something
at the same time?

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:20.250
And I think this is one step in
the evolution of how connected

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:21.970
we actually are.

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:24.220
PRESENTER: In the five years
since this first project,

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:26.780
"One day on Earth" has
spawned more collaborative

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:30.440
documentaries, a foundation,
a social media platform,

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:31.910
and a lot more.

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:33.680
But for Kyle, the soul
of the whole thing

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:35.820
remains in the participants.

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:39.550
KYLE RUDDICK: It was kind of
like, wow, you put an idea out

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:40.460
there.

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:42.400
And a lot of people
grabbed hold.

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:44.430
And a lot of people
got inspired.

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:45.800
And they made it their own.

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:48.460
Someone just heard our little
call to do something cool.

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:50.717
And they knew what
their cool was,

00:02:50.717 --> 00:02:52.300
and what their
beautiful was, and what

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:55.794
their inspirational was.

00:02:55.794 --> 00:02:58.210
PRESENTER: For access to another
unique part of the world,

00:02:58.210 --> 00:03:01.380
check out this episode on the
underground town in the middle

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:02.789
of the Australian Outback.

00:03:02.789 --> 00:03:04.830
PRESENTER 2: Most of the
residents of Coober Pedy

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:07.950
live in underground homes to
avoid the sun and the heat.

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:10.600
And the man in this photo,
who Elliott called Eddie,

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:12.812
was looking to build a
new home for himself.

00:03:12.812 --> 00:03:14.770
