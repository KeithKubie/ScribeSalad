00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:34.510
Some refer to the rock-like substance as “floating
gold” because of its hue and value.

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:40.410
(For reference, 175 pound, 79 kg, lump of
it was recently found floating off the coast

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:45.640
of Qurayat, netting the fishermen who found
it a cool $3 million when they sold it at

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:46.640
auction.)

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:50.370
Others call it “ambergris,” derived from
the Old French “ambre gris,” meaning “grey

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:51.370
amber.”

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:55.899
But perhaps the most accurate way to describe
the prized, rare, hard lumpy substance found

00:00:55.899 --> 00:01:01.640
floating in oceans and washed up on beaches
worldwide is excrement- whale excrement, to

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:03.329
be exact.

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:07.610
Ambergris is a strong smelling, waxy-feeling,
whale emission that’s been used for centuries

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:12.860
by humans in perfumes, medicines, foods and,
apparently now, cocktails.

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:17.420
For much of human history, it was a complete
mystery as to where this substance came from.

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:23.000
That all changed though, in 1724, when Boston
physician Zabdiel Boylston (who was also the

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.860
first to introduce the practice of inoculation
in the American colonies, at great personal

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:32.360
risk to himself in doing so in that case)
revealed in the scientific publication Philosophical

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:35.850
Transactions that ambergris came from sperm
whales.

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:40.720
He primarily supported his assertion by noting
an account of a whaler who claimed he found

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:44.110
25 pounds of it in the gut of a whale he killed.

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:48.920
Given ambergris will invariably have squid
beaks embedded in it, it was presumably easy

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:50.869
enough to put two and two together.

00:01:50.869 --> 00:01:55.080
On that note, while it’s often claimed that
where exactly ambergris came from is a much

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:59.020
more modern discovery (let alone what part
of the whale it came from), even for those

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:03.140
who failed to note the obscure reference by
Zabdiel Boylston, it’s surprising they missed

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:07.642
Herman Melville in the mid-19th century devoting
a full chapter of Moby Dick (Chapter XCII)

00:02:07.642 --> 00:02:08.642
to it.

00:02:08.642 --> 00:02:13.040
In it, he explicitly noted where it came from
and gave interesting insight into its use

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:14.040
at the time,

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:18.760
NOW this ambergris is a very curious substance,
and so important as an article of commerce,

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:24.950
that in 1791 a certain Nantucket-born Captain
Coffin was examined at the bar of the English

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:26.960
House of Commons on that subject.

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:32.890
For at that time, and indeed until a comparatively
late day, the precise origin of ambergris

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:38.610
remained, like amber itself, a problem to
the learned… ambergris is soft, waxy, and

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:44.590
so highly fragrant and spicy, that it is largely
used in perfumery, in pastiles, precious candles,

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:46.019
hair-powders, and pomatum.

00:02:46.019 --> 00:02:50.580
The Turks use it in cooking, and also carry
it to Mecca, for the same purpose that frankincense

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:52.900
is carried to St. Peter’s in Rome.

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:56.250
Some wine-merchants drop a few grains into
claret, to flavour it.

00:02:56.250 --> 00:03:00.270
Who would think, then, that such fine ladies
and gentlemen should regale themselves with

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:04.090
an essence found in the inglorious bowels
of a sick whale!

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:05.400
Yet so it is.

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:10.840
By some, ambergris is supposed to be the cause,
and by others the effect, of the dyspepsia

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:11.840
in the whale…

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:15.590
I have forgotten to say that there were found
in this ambergris certain hard, round, bony

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:20.150
plates, which at first Stubb thought might
be sailors’ trowsers-buttons; but it afterwards

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:25.049
turned out that they were nothing more than
pieces of small squid bones embalmed in that

00:03:25.049 --> 00:03:26.049
manner.

00:03:26.049 --> 00:03:29.590
Despite this very prominent reference, among
others, ambergris is still today often mistakenly

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:31.519
referred to as whale vomit.

00:03:31.519 --> 00:03:35.400
But, as previously noted, it is actually closer
to whale poop.

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:40.079
So how is ambergris made within the whale?

00:03:40.079 --> 00:03:44.370
In a nutshell, ambergris is produced when
a sperm whale has an upset stomach, as Melville

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:45.860
very astutely noted.

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:49.959
While sperm whales eat things like crab, octopus,
fish, shrimp, and small bottom-living sharks,

00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:51.859
they love squid.

00:03:51.859 --> 00:03:56.370
Normally, the hard beaks of squids are vomited
back up by the whale, but occasionally, the

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:58.900
beaks sometimes pass through into the intestines.

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:03.560
Notes Christopher Kemp, molecular biologist
and author of Floating Gold: A Natural (and

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:05.170
Unnatural) History of Ambergris,

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:10.090
Curved like a parrot’s beak, the squids’
[indigestible] beaks pass from the stomach,

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:13.889
chafing and irritating the delicate intestinal
lining on the way.

00:04:13.889 --> 00:04:17.799
As a growing mass, they are pushed farther
along the intestines and become a tangled

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:22.699
indigestible solid, saturated with feces,
which begins to obstruct the rectum.

00:04:22.699 --> 00:04:24.760
It also acts as a dam.

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:26.120
Feces builds up behind it.

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:31.230
The whale’s gastrointestinal system responds
by increasing water absorption from the lower

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:35.460
intestines, and gradually the feces saturating
the compacted mass of squid beaks becomes

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:38.800
like cement, binding the slurry together permanently.

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:42.630
It becomes a concentration- a smooth and striated
boulder.

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:47.610
At the same time, a fatty bile-like substance
is secreted inside of the intestine that ultimately

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:52.080
surrounds the sharp beaks and more or less
blunts their points, as well as helps the

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:54.270
mass slide its way through the whale.

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:58.770
In the end (literally), the substance mixes
with partially digested mass as described

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:00.830
and is eventually secreted.

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:04.650
When it’s first expelled into the water,
ambergris is pretty much as you’d expect-

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:07.699
it’s dark colored, viscous and smells like
fecal matter.

00:05:07.699 --> 00:05:12.320
But microbes, the sun, air and saltwater work
their magic on the mass while waves slowly

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:13.320
degrade it.

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:18.199
Eventually, it becomes gray and waxy, but
still retains chunks of squid beak as previously

00:05:18.199 --> 00:05:19.199
noted.

00:05:19.199 --> 00:05:21.849
It also stops smelling like poop once it’s
aged enough.

00:05:21.849 --> 00:05:27.300
People have variously described the aged smell
of ambergris as earthy, piney and tobacco-like.

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:32.490
And while it may seem strange, long before
Melville’s account, humans have been sniffing,

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:36.419
eating, and rubbing this whale excrement on
their skin, with the Ancient Egyptians known

00:05:36.419 --> 00:05:41.020
to have used it in incense, the Chinese, among
others, using it as an aphrodisiac, and many

00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:45.749
throughout history using it for various medicinal
purposes, including the Persians using it

00:05:45.749 --> 00:05:47.689
as a medicine to cure heart problems.

00:05:47.689 --> 00:05:54.949
King Henry V (1386-1422) and King Charles
II (1630-1685) often included it in their

00:05:54.949 --> 00:05:55.949
decadent meals.

00:05:55.949 --> 00:05:59.460
In fact, King Charles’ favorite meal was
supposedly eggs and ambergris.

00:05:59.460 --> 00:06:04.240
So unlike those who consumed it for its supposed
medicinal purposes, it would appear some,

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:06.879
like this royal pair, simply enjoyed the taste.

00:06:06.879 --> 00:06:11.770
As to what eating eggs and ambergris is like,
King Charles II’s affinity for it spurred

00:06:11.770 --> 00:06:16.199
the aforementioned author Christopher Kemp
to try the whale excrement with an egg-based

00:06:16.199 --> 00:06:21.270
recipe from the 1685 cookbook, The Accomplisht
Cook, by Robert May.

00:06:21.270 --> 00:06:22.270
Kemp reported,

00:06:22.270 --> 00:06:23.270
It crumbles like truffle.

00:06:23.270 --> 00:06:25.360
I fold it carefully into the eggs with a fork.

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:29.780
Rising and mingling with curls of steam from
the eggs, the familiar odor of ambergris begins

00:06:29.780 --> 00:06:34.840
to fill and clog my throat, a thick and unmistakable
smell that I can taste.

00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:37.840
It inhabits the back of my throat and fills
my sinuses.

00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:40.249
It is aromatic—both woody and floral.

00:06:40.249 --> 00:06:45.349
The smell reminds me of leaf litter on a forest
floor and of the delicate, frilly undersides

00:06:45.349 --> 00:06:48.530
of mushrooms that grow in damp and shaded
places.

00:06:48.530 --> 00:06:52.999
Although present in only very small amounts,
the cholesterol-rich ambergris coats my tongue

00:06:52.999 --> 00:06:55.479
and the inside of my mouth with a greasy film.

00:06:55.479 --> 00:06:59.969
I try to rinse it away by drinking water and
eating dry slices of bread, but it remains

00:06:59.969 --> 00:07:01.930
for an hour or longer.

00:07:01.930 --> 00:07:08.379
Speaking of more modern times, ambergris was
all the rage in various perfumes in the 20th

00:07:08.379 --> 00:07:12.810
century, with it not only lending its scent
to the products, but also reportedly helping

00:07:12.810 --> 00:07:16.849
the perfume adhere to the skin thanks to its
slightly waxy nature.

00:07:16.849 --> 00:07:21.439
Of course, due to the rarity of the substance,
most perfume makers have long since switched

00:07:21.439 --> 00:07:26.699
to alternative substances to try to achieve
the same scent and properties, including using

00:07:26.699 --> 00:07:30.909
synthetic ambergris, with the first of those
developed in the mid-20th century by Swiss

00:07:30.909 --> 00:07:32.879
chemist Max Atoll.

00:07:32.879 --> 00:07:37.559
One ambergris dealer, Frenchman Bernard Perrin,
however, notes that some perfume companies

00:07:37.559 --> 00:07:41.059
still occasionally purchase it for use in
some of their more exclusive lines.

00:07:41.059 --> 00:07:42.059
He also states, “We also sell it to a royal
family in the Middle East and they use it

00:07:42.059 --> 00:07:43.059
as an aphrodisiac.

00:07:43.059 --> 00:07:44.059
Apparently they take some milk, some honey,
and grind up small quantities of the amber

00:07:44.059 --> 00:07:45.059
and put that in as well…”

00:07:45.059 --> 00:07:46.059
So, for those who have the money and want
to indulge in the ultimate decadence of eating

00:07:46.059 --> 00:07:50.009
or rubbing bits of aged whale excrement on
their bodies, ambergris is still available

00:07:50.009 --> 00:07:55.370
thanks to the tireless efforts of ambergris
hunters the world over, who no doubt are just

00:07:55.370 --> 00:07:58.740
a phone call away from getting their own History
Channel show.

00:07:58.740 --> 00:08:02.940
Yes, while stories do pop up now and then
seeming to indicate it’s always a random

00:08:02.940 --> 00:08:07.290
happy accident when individuals find their
lotto ticket of ambergris washed up on a beach,

00:08:07.290 --> 00:08:08.460
it usually isn’t.

00:08:08.460 --> 00:08:13.199
There’s a whole network of sometimes very
organized ambergris searchers looking to cash

00:08:13.199 --> 00:08:14.199
in.

00:08:14.199 --> 00:08:17.970
According to Kemp, there are even groups of
very dedicated people who engage in sometimes

00:08:17.970 --> 00:08:21.689
violent turf wars in hopes of finding a chunk
of the stuff.

00:08:21.689 --> 00:08:24.370
Said Kemp in an interview with Atlas Obscura,

00:08:24.370 --> 00:08:28.901
These people have their own language and taxonomies,
and I love the idea that they’re out there

00:08:28.901 --> 00:08:33.839
trying to find this strange stuff, which,
after all, was shit out by a whale, and then

00:08:33.839 --> 00:08:37.240
weathered for years by the elements…

00:08:37.240 --> 00:08:42.900
Today, there seems to be a lot of ambiguity
in terms of the legality of ambergris in certain

00:08:42.900 --> 00:08:43.900
parts of the world.

00:08:43.900 --> 00:08:47.620
Australia has outright banned it being used
in any products, while the United States’

00:08:47.620 --> 00:08:49.490
laws are less definitive.

00:08:49.490 --> 00:08:54.490
Most officials consider it to be illegal under
the 1973 Endangered Species Act, but little

00:08:54.490 --> 00:09:00.000
is usually done to attempt to prosecute anyone
who purchase or sells it, or products that

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:01.000
include it.

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:05.930
This is because it isn’t clear whether said
Act includes protecting the whale’s waste.

00:09:05.930 --> 00:09:09.300
After all, collecting a portion of the waste
potentially many months after the whale has

00:09:09.300 --> 00:09:14.990
secreted it does no harm to the whale in question,
and the market for it actually encourages

00:09:14.990 --> 00:09:18.980
protection of the whales, as the more sperm
whales there are, the more ambergris will

00:09:18.980 --> 00:09:21.620
be available to find its way to beaches the
world over.

00:09:21.620 --> 00:09:25.500
That said, as previously mentioned, it was
once common practice for whalers to harvest

00:09:25.500 --> 00:09:29.230
the ambergris from a recently killed whale,
if it was present.

00:09:29.230 --> 00:09:33.140
The potential that a given entity may have
acquired the ambergris through such a method

00:09:33.140 --> 00:09:37.430
is perhaps why many governments aren’t keen
on making it explicitly legal.

00:09:37.430 --> 00:09:41.141
But because it’s far more likely the ambergris
was simply found on the beach or the like

00:09:41.141 --> 00:09:45.560
(and this form is preferred given high quality
ambergris needs to be aged in the ocean),

00:09:45.560 --> 00:09:50.040
many of these same legal entities (usually)
look the other way when it comes to people

00:09:50.040 --> 00:11:25.110
trading in ambergris or products that include
it.
