00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.600
What I wanted to do in this video is familiarize ourselves with one of the most important molecules in biology

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:08.000
And that is Glucose

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.320
sometimes referred to as Dextrose

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:13.720
and the term Dextrose comes from the fact

00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:15.720
that the form of Glucose typically

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:23.160
Typically found in nature if you form a solution of it, it's going to polarize light to the right and Dextre means

00:00:23.289 --> 00:00:23.980
Right

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:30.299
But the more typical term glucose this literally means sweet in greek if you ask a greek friend to say sweet

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:35.160
it sounds like Lucas or I'm not saying it perfectly, but it sounds a lot like a glucose

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:40.799
And that's because that's where the word comes from and it is super important because it is it is it is how

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:48.360
energy [is] stored and transferred in biological systems in fact right [now] when if someone were to talk about your blood your blood sugar

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:52.620
they're talking about the glucose content, so when people talk about blood

00:00:53.379 --> 00:01:00.269
blood sugar they're talking about your they're talking about your glucose content the whole process of photosynthesis

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:02.909
this is all about plants using harnessing the [sun's] energy and

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:07.860
storing that energy in the form of glucose when we talk about when we talk about things like

00:01:08.409 --> 00:01:10.739
respiration in our in our cells cellular respiration

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:17.759
that's all about taking glucose and using it to full and to create atp's which are the molecular currency of energy

00:01:18.009 --> 00:01:22.199
Inside of our body, so these are in credit is an incredibly important molecule

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:26.549
We can start wreaking chains of glucose to form Glycogen to form

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:33.269
Starches this along with another similar another simple sugar fructose you can use to form our table sugar

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:37.979
But even glucose by itself is sweet so let's get familiar with it as a molecule

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:39.729
so immediately

00:01:39.729 --> 00:01:45.929
When you look at this is it kind of drawn as a as an open chain we see that we have one two three

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:48.629
Actually, let me number these we have one two

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:53.729
three four five six carbons, so

00:01:54.369 --> 00:01:55.799
chemical formula would be C

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:59.819
sub six a subscript of six we have how many hydrogen's

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:06.839
How many hydrogen's we have we have 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 hydrogen's?

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:12.149
C6H12 and then we have how many oxygens do we have?

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:17.200
Have one two three four five six oxygens

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:24.519
Six oxygens, so you might notice we have six carbons and then the ratio for every one oxygen

00:02:24.519 --> 00:02:28.449
We have two hydrogen's which is really the ratio of Hydrogen's to oxygens in

00:02:28.519 --> 00:02:33.369
Water and if we want to really if we really want to if we add obviously here

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:34.930
We don't have just two hydrogen's and one oxygen

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:40.959
We have 12 hydrogen's and six oxygens, but it's really good to even just familiarize yourselves with what are the different parts here

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:44.438
So we see on the number one carbon it is part of a carbonyl group

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:47.140
when a carbon is bonded to

00:02:47.659 --> 00:02:50.439
double bonded to an oxygen like that. That's a carbonyl

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:53.180
Carbonyl

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:55.780
carbonyL group and in fact because this carbon

00:02:55.780 --> 00:03:00.489
it's double bonded to an oxygen, but then it's other bonds are I guess you could say a

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:06.489
Carbon chain right over here and then but this other bond right here is a hydrogen

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:10.509
we would call this an aldehyde we would call this an

00:03:11.359 --> 00:03:13.839
aldehyde group and it makes Al

00:03:14.989 --> 00:03:19.418
Aldehyde and it would officially make the entire molecule an aldehyde if you contain an aldehyde group

00:03:19.419 --> 00:03:22.209
You are an aldehyde, so glucose

00:03:22.209 --> 00:03:28.029
and when it's written when it's drawn as a straight chain or it's a straight chain form it would be considered an aldehyde and then

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:32.769
Of course it has all these hydroxyl groups on them, and these hydroxyl groups these O-H groups over here

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:39.819
That would officially make glucose also it would officially make it an alcohol, and it's neat to keep in mind

00:03:39.819 --> 00:03:41.819
How the structure is so you have six carbons?

00:03:42.079 --> 00:03:44.559
One of them is part of this aldehyde group

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:47.199
It's part of this carbonyl right over here

00:03:47.199 --> 00:03:52.749
And then the other five are each bonded to a hydroxyl and what I've oriented it this way

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:59.559
four of the hydroxyls are on the right-hand side and the one on the three carbon is on the left-hand side and

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:02.109
all of the other carbon bonds are with

00:04:02.269 --> 00:04:08.649
hydrogen carbon likes to form four covalent bonds every one of these six carbons has formed four covalent bonds

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:12.459
And so you would fill up all the rest once you've accounted for this carbonyl here

00:04:12.459 --> 00:04:16.029
And you've accounted for all of these hydroxyls everything else is going to be hydrogen

00:04:16.579 --> 00:04:21.038
Now this is when you've drawn when you've drawn glucose just as a straight chain

00:04:21.039 --> 00:04:24.158
but many times you will see it in its cyclical form

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:29.680
It's neat to kind of think of how do you go from this form to this form over here?

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:34.389
And so what I've drawn here is this exact same this exact open chain

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:39.520
But I've started to I've started to bend it a little bit and just to be able to keep track of things let's renumber

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:43.029
The carbons, so this is the carbon. That's part of the carbonyl group

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:46.840
So it's carbon one and then we number up from there two three

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:48.970
four five

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:55.390
And then that is the number six carbon the reason why I've made these this bond over here nice and fat is

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:57.789
To show that it's it's kind of closer to us

00:04:57.790 --> 00:05:02.200
It's popping out of the page and as we go from the the second carbon of the first carbon

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:06.129
We're going back into the page when we go from the third carbon to the fourth Carbon

00:05:06.130 --> 00:05:12.070
We are going we are going back into the page right over here, so this big fat bond. This is

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:15.549
between Carbon three and Carbon two, that's this

00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:19.930
That's this right over here and this going from two to one

00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:21.250
That's this bond

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:24.640
And I'll draw it a little bit kind of going in and then this bond is

00:05:24.890 --> 00:05:31.659
This bond right over here and so it take a second pause the video if you need but try to orient yourself to orient yourself

00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:36.100
Imagine we're going to take this to the right like this to bring it over here

00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:40.840
And then we're going to rotate we're going to rotate this end and bend it up backwards like that

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:46.840
To get to this form C six is now bent all the way up is now rotated all the way up there

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:52.929
We've bent we've bent this chain and the whole reason is is because this will typically react the hydroxyl group

00:05:52.930 --> 00:05:53.470
This is it

00:05:53.470 --> 00:05:58.300
This is the the most typical form of glucose you will see when you see in a sick little form there's actually other forms that

00:05:58.300 --> 00:06:02.740
You can have but the oxygen that forms a hydroxyl group on the fifth carbon

00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:07.120
it can it can attack it can attack the the

00:06:07.430 --> 00:06:10.570
The number one carbon that forms this carbonyl group

00:06:10.570 --> 00:06:14.890
And that's because oxygen we've talked a lot about it is very electronegative likes to hog electrons

00:06:14.930 --> 00:06:19.720
So this carbon is partially positive and so you could take one of the lone pairs

00:06:20.570 --> 00:06:24.099
You could take one of this oxygen right over here. It's going to have two lone pairs

00:06:24.100 --> 00:06:29.950
Let me just draw them as neatly as I can that's one lone pair, and then this is another lone pair right over here

00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:31.730
so this oxygen

00:06:31.730 --> 00:06:32.990
can

00:06:32.990 --> 00:06:38.470
Form a bond with this carbon when we learn organic chemistry and more depth, we'd call that a nucleophilic attack

00:06:38.470 --> 00:06:40.760
it sounds very fancy. Just the fact that these are drawn to each other this has a partially positive charge this guy has a

00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:46.780
lone pairs of electrons that can be used to form bonds with things and so when that when those electrons form this bond or

00:06:53.180 --> 00:06:55.300
Bond to this carbon that's going to be this bond

00:06:55.880 --> 00:06:57.680
this Bond right

00:06:57.680 --> 00:06:58.450
over here

00:06:58.450 --> 00:07:03.939
And then this carbon can let go this carbon can let go of the electrons in

00:07:04.310 --> 00:07:07.239
One of these let me do this in a more obvious color

00:07:07.820 --> 00:07:12.669
and in the double bond right [over] here it could let go of one of the bonds the electrons in one of the bonds and

00:07:12.669 --> 00:07:20.199
then that can be taken back by the oxygen or even better that can be used by that oxygen to capture a

00:07:20.419 --> 00:07:23.589
Hydrogen proton in the solution and actually probably part of a

00:07:24.200 --> 00:07:25.460
Hydronium Molecule

00:07:25.460 --> 00:07:27.460
But let me just draw it this way

00:07:27.470 --> 00:07:30.489
this would just be used to capture a

00:07:31.100 --> 00:07:37.269
Hydrogen proton that would just be a hydrogen a hydrogen atom without its electron. It's just a hydrogen ion

00:07:37.490 --> 00:07:41.049
It would just be a hydrogen proton and that would form this bond

00:07:41.479 --> 00:07:48.129
That would form this bond right over here and let me let me just be very clear this carbon this carbon right over here is

00:07:48.770 --> 00:07:53.919
This carbon right over there this oxygen this oxygen is

00:07:54.500 --> 00:08:01.239
This oxygen is that oxygen right over there, and so hopefully you see how it forms a cyclone. You're probably saying Oh, wait wait

00:08:01.240 --> 00:08:03.240
don't we have a little hydrogen attached here

00:08:03.350 --> 00:08:07.929
isn't the way I've drawn it looks like there's an extra hydrogen over here, and then that would leave this guy with a

00:08:08.630 --> 00:08:14.529
Positive charge we leave with a positive charge, but you can imagine we're in a solution of water then hey

00:08:14.530 --> 00:08:17.919
I have some I have another water molecule right over here

00:08:17.919 --> 00:08:21.489
And you know these things are all bouncing around and interacting in different ways

00:08:21.680 --> 00:08:25.660
But it could use let me do that in the right color it could use

00:08:26.360 --> 00:08:32.500
So that's oxygen it could use one of its lone pairs instead of this you know this will become positive temporarily

00:08:32.500 --> 00:08:39.250
But then it can use it can do it can use one of its lone pairs to grab just the hydrogen proton which would allow

00:08:39.529 --> 00:08:42.969
Which will allow this character to take its to take its

00:08:43.250 --> 00:08:48.880
Electrons to take these electrons back and turn into this character and just be neutral and then this this guy

00:08:49.010 --> 00:08:53.349
Would have gained so we have a proton going into the solution you have hi

00:08:53.920 --> 00:08:55.510
But we took a proton from [the] solution

00:08:55.510 --> 00:08:58.569
We took a proton we gave a proton to the solution

00:08:58.570 --> 00:09:01.570
And so you could end up with this so the whole reason I did

00:09:01.570 --> 00:09:05.770
This is [just] so when you see it in biology class or chemistry class you're not intimidated by it in fact

00:09:05.770 --> 00:09:09.939
This is something that's really valuable to get very very familiar [with] because you're going to see

00:09:10.430 --> 00:09:14.109
Glucose and other sugars in many many many different molecules

00:09:14.720 --> 00:09:16.720
throughout your academic career
