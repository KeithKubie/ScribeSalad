00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.270
so these creatures engage in in

00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:02.280
so these creatures engage in in
 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:05.120
so these creatures engage in in
dominance disputes and and I think

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:05.130
dominance disputes and and I think
 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:06.200
dominance disputes and and I think
dominance is the right way to think

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:06.210
dominance is the right way to think
 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:07.820
dominance is the right way to think
about it because lobsters aren't very

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:07.830
about it because lobsters aren't very
 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:09.500
about it because lobsters aren't very
empathic and they're not very social and

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:09.510
empathic and they're not very social and
 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:11.299
empathic and they're not very social and
so it really is the toughest lobster

00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:11.309
so it really is the toughest lobster
 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:13.190
so it really is the toughest lobster
that wins you know and what's so cool

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:13.200
that wins you know and what's so cool
 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:16.279
that wins you know and what's so cool
about the lobster is that when a lobster

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:16.289
about the lobster is that when a lobster
 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:19.099
about the lobster is that when a lobster
wins he flexes and gets bigger so he

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:19.109
wins he flexes and gets bigger so he
 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:21.109
wins he flexes and gets bigger so he
looks bigger because he's a winner

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:21.119
looks bigger because he's a winner
 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:23.060
looks bigger because he's a winner
it's like he's advertising that and the

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070
it's like he's advertising that and the
 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:25.279
it's like he's advertising that and the
biological the neural chemical system

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289
biological the neural chemical system
 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:27.620
biological the neural chemical system
that makes him flex is serotonergic and

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630
that makes him flex is serotonergic and
 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:29.269
that makes him flex is serotonergic and
you think well who cares what the hell

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279
you think well who cares what the hell
 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:30.650
you think well who cares what the hell
does that mean well tell you what it

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660
does that mean well tell you what it
 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:32.120
does that mean well tell you what it
means it's the same chemical that's

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130
means it's the same chemical that's
 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:34.280
means it's the same chemical that's
affected by antidepressants in human

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290
affected by antidepressants in human
 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:35.900
affected by antidepressants in human
beings and so like if you're depressed

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910
beings and so like if you're depressed
 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:37.880
beings and so like if you're depressed
you're a defeated lobster like you're

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890
you're a defeated lobster like you're
 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:40.100
you're a defeated lobster like you're
there like this I'm small I'm not you

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110
there like this I'm small I'm not you
 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:42.020
there like this I'm small I'm not you
know things are dangerous I don't want

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030
know things are dangerous I don't want
 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:43.310
know things are dangerous I don't want
to fight you give someone an

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320
to fight you give someone an
 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:44.990
to fight you give someone an
antidepressant it's like up they stretch

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000
antidepressant it's like up they stretch
 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.360
antidepressant it's like up they stretch
and then they're ready to like take on

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370
and then they're ready to like take on
 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:48.889
and then they're ready to like take on
the world again well if you give

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899
the world again well if you give
 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:50.779
the world again well if you give
lobsters who just got defeated in a

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789
lobsters who just got defeated in a
 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:53.150
lobsters who just got defeated in a
fight serotonin then they stretch out

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160
fight serotonin then they stretch out
 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.189
fight serotonin then they stretch out
and they'll fight again and that's like

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199
and they'll fight again and that's like
 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:57.439
and they'll fight again and that's like
we separated from those creatures on the

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449
we separated from those creatures on the
 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:00:59.000
we separated from those creatures on the
evolutionary timescale somewhere between

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010
evolutionary timescale somewhere between
 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.610
evolutionary timescale somewhere between
350 and 600 million years ago and the

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620
350 and 600 million years ago and the
 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:04.189
350 and 600 million years ago and the
damn neuro chemistry is the same and so

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199
damn neuro chemistry is the same and so
 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:06.460
damn neuro chemistry is the same and so
that's another indication of just how

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:06.470
that's another indication of just how
 

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:09.560
that's another indication of just how
important hierarchies of authority are I

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570
important hierarchies of authority are I
 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:11.929
important hierarchies of authority are I
mean they've been conserved since the

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939
mean they've been conserved since the
 

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:13.760
mean they've been conserved since the
time of lobsters right there weren't

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770
time of lobsters right there weren't
 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:16.609
time of lobsters right there weren't
trees around with lobsters first first

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619
trees around with lobsters first first
 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:18.620
trees around with lobsters first first
manifested themselves on the planet and

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630
manifested themselves on the planet and
 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:20.749
manifested themselves on the planet and
so what that means is these hierarchies

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759
so what that means is these hierarchies
 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:22.280
so what that means is these hierarchies
that I've been talking about those

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290
that I've been talking about those
 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:25.700
that I've been talking about those
things are older than trees and so one

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710
things are older than trees and so one
 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:28.940
things are older than trees and so one
of the truisms for what constitutes real

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950
of the truisms for what constitutes real
 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:31.700
of the truisms for what constitutes real
from a Darwinian perspective is that

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710
from a Darwinian perspective is that
 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:34.370
from a Darwinian perspective is that
which has been around the longest period

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380
which has been around the longest period
 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:35.990
which has been around the longest period
of time right because it's had the

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000
of time right because it's had the
 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.670
of time right because it's had the
longest period of time to exert

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680
longest period of time to exert
 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:40.249
longest period of time to exert
selection pressure well we know we

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259
selection pressure well we know we
 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:42.620
selection pressure well we know we
evolved and lived in trees something on

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630
evolved and lived in trees something on
 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:44.630
evolved and lived in trees something on
the order of 60 million years ago we're

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640
the order of 60 million years ago we're
 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:47.060
the order of 60 million years ago we're
talking ten times as far back as that

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070
talking ten times as far back as that
 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:49.789
talking ten times as far back as that
for the hierarchy and so the idea that

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799
for the hierarchy and so the idea that
 

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:51.980
for the hierarchy and so the idea that
human beings that the hierarchy is

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990
human beings that the hierarchy is
 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:53.780
human beings that the hierarchy is
something that has exerted selection

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790
something that has exerted selection
 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:55.460
something that has exerted selection
pressure on human beings is I don't

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470
pressure on human beings is I don't
 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:57.740
pressure on human beings is I don't
think that's a disputable that's not a

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750
think that's a disputable that's not a
 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:01.010
think that's a disputable that's not a
disputable issue how it's done it and

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020
disputable issue how it's done it and
 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:02.510
disputable issue how it's done it and
exactly what that means we can argue

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520
exactly what that means we can argue
 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:04.270
exactly what that means we can argue
about but like that sort of biological

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:04.280
about but like that sort of biological
 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:06.410
about but like that sort of biological
continuity is just absolutely

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420
continuity is just absolutely
 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:07.340
continuity is just absolutely
unbelievable

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350
unbelievable
 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:10.029
unbelievable
I it was funny because I revealed this

00:02:10.029 --> 00:02:10.039
I it was funny because I revealed this
 

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:12.770
I it was funny because I revealed this
finding you know I didn't discover this

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780
finding you know I didn't discover this
 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:13.880
finding you know I didn't discover this
I read about it but

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890
I read about it but
 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:15.410
I read about it but
I talked to my graduate students about I

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:15.420
I talked to my graduate students about I
 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:16.910
I talked to my graduate students about I
used to take them out for breakfast you

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:16.920
used to take them out for breakfast you
 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:18.650
used to take them out for breakfast you
know and they were a very contentious

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:18.660
know and they were a very contentious
 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:19.520
know and they were a very contentious
snappy Bunch

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:19.530
snappy Bunch
 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:21.890
snappy Bunch
and and they're always trying to one-up

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:21.900
and and they're always trying to one-up
 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:23.360
and and they're always trying to one-up
each other and they were quite witty and

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:23.370
each other and they were quite witty and
 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:25.460
each other and they were quite witty and
for like six months until it got very

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:25.470
for like six months until it got very
 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:27.410
for like six months until it got very
annoying every time one of them went up

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:27.420
annoying every time one of them went up
 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:28.760
annoying every time one of them went up
the other they'd stretch themselves out

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:28.770
the other they'd stretch themselves out
 

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:32.840
the other they'd stretch themselves out
like snap their hands like so that was

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:32.850
like snap their hands like so that was
 

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:34.790
like snap their hands like so that was
that was very funny it was it was really

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:34.800
that was very funny it was it was really
 

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:36.890
that was very funny it was it was really
very funny so you see this in lobsters

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:36.900
very funny so you see this in lobsters
 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:40.190
very funny so you see this in lobsters
and so that's pretty amazing so yeah and

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:40.200
and so that's pretty amazing so yeah and
 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:41.510
and so that's pretty amazing so yeah and
one of the other thing that's really

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:41.520
one of the other thing that's really
 

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:44.390
one of the other thing that's really
cool about lobsters is that let's say

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:44.400
cool about lobsters is that let's say
 

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:45.949
cool about lobsters is that let's say
you've been like top lobster for a long

00:02:45.949 --> 00:02:45.959
you've been like top lobster for a long
 

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:47.420
you've been like top lobster for a long
time but you're getting kind of old and

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:47.430
time but you're getting kind of old and
 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:50.390
time but you're getting kind of old and
some young lobster just you know wails

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:50.400
some young lobster just you know wails
 

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:52.340
some young lobster just you know wails
the hell out of you and and so you're

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:52.350
the hell out of you and and so you're
 

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:54.110
the hell out of you and and so you're
all depressed but thing is your brain is

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:54.120
all depressed but thing is your brain is
 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:56.630
all depressed but thing is your brain is
dominant but you don't have much of a

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:56.640
dominant but you don't have much of a
 

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:58.100
dominant but you don't have much of a
brain because you're a lobster and so

00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:58.110
brain because you're a lobster and so
 

00:02:58.110 --> 00:02:59.509
brain because you're a lobster and so
now what are you gonna do cuz you just

00:02:59.509 --> 00:02:59.519
now what are you gonna do cuz you just
 

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:02.030
now what are you gonna do cuz you just
lost and the answer is while your brain

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:02.040
lost and the answer is while your brain
 

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:03.979
lost and the answer is while your brain
will dissolve and then you'll grow a

00:03:03.979 --> 00:03:03.989
will dissolve and then you'll grow a
 

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:06.920
will dissolve and then you'll grow a
subordinate brain yeah and so that's

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:06.930
subordinate brain yeah and so that's
 

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:08.660
subordinate brain yeah and so that's
we're thinking about two right here for

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:08.670
we're thinking about two right here for
 

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:10.370
we're thinking about two right here for
a couple of reasons first of all if any

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:10.380
a couple of reasons first of all if any
 

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:12.860
a couple of reasons first of all if any
of you have ever been seriously defeated

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:12.870
of you have ever been seriously defeated
 

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:16.100
of you have ever been seriously defeated
in life you know what that's like it's

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:16.110
in life you know what that's like it's
 

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:17.930
in life you know what that's like it's
like it's a death a descent a

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:17.940
like it's a death a descent a
 

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:20.360
like it's a death a descent a
dissolution and if you're lucky a

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:20.370
dissolution and if you're lucky a
 

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:22.940
dissolution and if you're lucky a
regrowth and and maybe not as the same

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:22.950
regrowth and and maybe not as the same
 

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:24.170
regrowth and and maybe not as the same
person that's what happens to people

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:24.180
person that's what happens to people
 

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:25.460
person that's what happens to people
with post-traumatic stress disorder

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:25.470
with post-traumatic stress disorder
 

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:27.560
with post-traumatic stress disorder
right their brains undergo permanent

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:27.570
right their brains undergo permanent
 

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:29.960
right their brains undergo permanent
neurological transformation and they

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:29.970
neurological transformation and they
 

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:31.759
neurological transformation and they
then inhabit a world it's much more

00:03:31.759 --> 00:03:31.769
then inhabit a world it's much more
 

00:03:31.769 --> 00:03:33.020
then inhabit a world it's much more
dangerous than the world that they

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:33.030
dangerous than the world that they
 

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:35.030
dangerous than the world that they
inhabited to begin with but we also know

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:35.040
inhabited to begin with but we also know
 

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:36.500
inhabited to begin with but we also know
- if you have post-traumatic stress

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:36.510
- if you have post-traumatic stress
 

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:38.150
- if you have post-traumatic stress
disorder or depression that your

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:38.160
disorder or depression that your
 

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:40.550
disorder or depression that your
hippocampus shrinks right it dies and

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:40.560
hippocampus shrinks right it dies and
 

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:42.979
hippocampus shrinks right it dies and
shrinks and you can sometimes get it to

00:03:42.979 --> 00:03:42.989
shrinks and you can sometimes get it to
 

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:44.810
shrinks and you can sometimes get it to
grow back your hippocampus shrinks and

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:44.820
grow back your hippocampus shrinks and
 

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:46.910
grow back your hippocampus shrinks and
your amygdala grows and the amygdala

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:46.920
your amygdala grows and the amygdala
 

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:49.130
your amygdala grows and the amygdala
increases emotional sensitivity and the

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:49.140
increases emotional sensitivity and the
 

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:50.660
increases emotional sensitivity and the
hippocampus inhibits emotional

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:50.670
hippocampus inhibits emotional
 

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:52.370
hippocampus inhibits emotional
sensitivity and so if you've been badly

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:52.380
sensitivity and so if you've been badly
 

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:54.080
sensitivity and so if you've been badly
defeated the hippocampus shrinks and the

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:54.090
defeated the hippocampus shrinks and the
 

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:57.470
defeated the hippocampus shrinks and the
amygdala grows now if you recover the

00:03:57.470 --> 00:03:57.480
amygdala grows now if you recover the
 

00:03:57.480 --> 00:03:59.509
amygdala grows now if you recover the
hippocampus will regrow and the

00:03:59.509 --> 00:03:59.519
hippocampus will regrow and the
 

00:03:59.519 --> 00:04:01.069
hippocampus will regrow and the
antidepressants actually seem to help

00:04:01.069 --> 00:04:01.079
antidepressants actually seem to help
 

00:04:01.079 --> 00:04:02.780
antidepressants actually seem to help
that but the damn amygdala never shrinks

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:02.790
that but the damn amygdala never shrinks
 

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:05.900
that but the damn amygdala never shrinks
again and so well so that's another

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:05.910
again and so well so that's another
 

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:07.699
again and so well so that's another
lesson from the lobster it's quite a

00:04:07.699 --> 00:04:07.709
lesson from the lobster it's quite a
 

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:10.099
lesson from the lobster it's quite a
terrifying one but but it's one like

00:04:10.099 --> 00:04:10.109
terrifying one but but it's one like
 

00:04:10.109 --> 00:04:11.840
terrifying one but but it's one like
it's so interesting that you can relate

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:11.850
it's so interesting that you can relate
 

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:13.520
it's so interesting that you can relate
to that right oh it's like I get what

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:13.530
to that right oh it's like I get what
 

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:14.960
to that right oh it's like I get what
that poor crustacean is going through

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:14.970
that poor crustacean is going through
 

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:17.600
that poor crustacean is going through
you know
