1
00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:03,850
My wife and I suffered
three weeks of turmoil,

2
00:00:03,910 --> 00:00:07,330
which including losing,
which included losing a child.

3
00:00:07,930 --> 00:00:11,110
How do I expedite that moment
when we pick up ourselves,

4
00:00:11,350 --> 00:00:16,060
pick ourselves up and keep moving forward
because I am done sulking and we need

5
00:00:16,061 --> 00:00:19,360
to move forward basically
how to push through.

6
00:00:24,450 --> 00:00:25,283
So

7
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:26,513
yeah,

8
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:33,260
I mean obviously that's heartbreaking and
I can't even imagine the pain that you

9
00:00:36,911 --> 00:00:41,320
are going through in this situation.
It's one of those things,

10
00:00:41,620 --> 00:00:43,030
we've talked about this before.

11
00:00:43,300 --> 00:00:48,300
The fact is we don't really
have a cultural protocol
for what to do when we lose

12
00:00:52,751 --> 00:00:53,584
a loved one

13
00:00:55,680 --> 00:01:00,680
and you have to basically
make up that protocol.

14
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:03,810
I can't,

15
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:09,600
I can't dictate what that
protocol is going to be for you,

16
00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:11,970
but I can

17
00:01:13,470 --> 00:01:17,040
tell you some things from my perspective,

18
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:21,180
from some of the things
that I've been through.

19
00:01:21,810 --> 00:01:26,810
I can tell you my perspective on loss

20
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:33,920
and the first thing is that you
already know it's going to be wretched

21
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:39,150
and you're not going to escape it.

22
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:46,440
And that pain in this is,
this is something that I've identified.

23
00:01:47,610 --> 00:01:49,710
The pain that's going to come,

24
00:01:49,711 --> 00:01:54,711
it's going to come in waves and at first
you won't even notice that their waves

25
00:01:56,911 --> 00:02:01,290
because all the waves are going to be so
close together and they're going to be

26
00:02:01,291 --> 00:02:06,090
so continual and they're going to be right
on top of each other and the pain and

27
00:02:06,091 --> 00:02:09,990
the sadness is going to
feel like it's so heavy.

28
00:02:10,170 --> 00:02:14,520
It's going to feel like
you are drowning in sorrow.

29
00:02:14,670 --> 00:02:18,060
Like you're not going to get any air
and like you're not going to be able to

30
00:02:18,061 --> 00:02:19,860
escape that sadness.

31
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:24,150
That's what the waves feel like at first.

32
00:02:28,460 --> 00:02:33,460
And then at some point there's
going to be a little break,

33
00:02:33,591 --> 00:02:37,670
just a little break, just a little
bit of light in the darkness.

34
00:02:37,671 --> 00:02:42,410
Something is going to make you smile,
something is going to make you laugh.

35
00:02:42,590 --> 00:02:45,950
Something's gonna just show
you just a little bit of light.

36
00:02:47,870 --> 00:02:49,010
But I don't know when
that's going to happen.

37
00:02:50,190 --> 00:02:51,023
Yeah.

38
00:02:51,130 --> 00:02:54,490
And then you're going to see that little,
that little smile, that little light.

39
00:02:54,550 --> 00:02:55,520
And then the,
uh,

40
00:02:55,550 --> 00:03:00,550
another wave of pain is going to back
again and it's going to be strong and you

41
00:03:01,571 --> 00:03:06,010
won't have any control over it. You
won't be able to say, no, no, I'm, I'm,

42
00:03:06,070 --> 00:03:08,680
I'm in the right now, or I'm
smiling right now. I'm not gonna,

43
00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:10,990
I'm not gonna go back there. No,
you're not going to able to control it.

44
00:03:10,991 --> 00:03:14,170
And that's scary.
It's scary because we,

45
00:03:14,710 --> 00:03:16,540
we get used to as adults,
hey,

46
00:03:16,541 --> 00:03:19,570
we can kind of get control of things and
now all of a sudden you're not going to

47
00:03:19,571 --> 00:03:23,950
have control. It's going to hit
you and you're going to feel it.

48
00:03:25,470 --> 00:03:26,030
Okay?

49
00:03:26,030 --> 00:03:28,460
But again,
like a wave,

50
00:03:28,461 --> 00:03:33,461
like a wave in the ocean that is going
to eventually subside again and you'll

51
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:38,270
see a little bit of light and you'll get
a little bit of a smile and you'll feel

52
00:03:38,271 --> 00:03:40,430
okay for a second. And then guess
what? Another wave's gonna hit you.

53
00:03:43,190 --> 00:03:46,450
It might not be as strong
as that other way. D Wave.

54
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:50,080
And you might not even notice that
it's not as strong. But again,

55
00:03:50,081 --> 00:03:53,530
you can't control your emotions
and you'll find yourself,

56
00:03:53,531 --> 00:03:55,600
this is what I'm talking about factually.

57
00:03:56,650 --> 00:04:01,630
You're going to be sitting there and
all of a sudden you're going to be just

58
00:04:01,631 --> 00:04:05,650
crying uncontrollably.
That wave is going to hit you.

59
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:10,270
You're going to go from normal to just
crying uncontrollably and being sad.

60
00:04:12,310 --> 00:04:15,940
That's what's going to happen. And it
again, in your mind, you can be thinking,

61
00:04:15,941 --> 00:04:18,190
I can't control this as
it's a wave and you're,

62
00:04:18,250 --> 00:04:20,830
you're at the mercy of
this ocean of sorrow,

63
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:24,450
but don't let that scare you.

64
00:04:26,230 --> 00:04:30,610
Don't let that scare you cause I'm
telling you that that wave is going to

65
00:04:30,611 --> 00:04:33,010
subside again and this is going to go on.

66
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:35,620
It's going to go on and the waves,

67
00:04:37,230 --> 00:04:39,420
they will become weaker.

68
00:04:41,510 --> 00:04:41,720
Okay?

69
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:45,560
And what you need to realize is just
because the waves are becoming weaker,

70
00:04:45,561 --> 00:04:50,561
this doesn't mean that you love your
child less or you miss them less or that

71
00:04:51,441 --> 00:04:54,110
you aren't crushed at their passing.

72
00:04:54,410 --> 00:04:58,910
It just means that you're starting
to be able to deal with it,

73
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:01,820
which is what you're supposed to do.

74
00:05:05,010 --> 00:05:09,870
And as the waves get weaker,
which they will,

75
00:05:10,140 --> 00:05:12,420
they'll also appear less frequently.

76
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:15,970
And again,
that's okay.

77
00:05:16,330 --> 00:05:19,690
It doesn't mean that you don't
think your child all the time,

78
00:05:19,691 --> 00:05:22,420
it just means that it's being dealt with.

79
00:05:27,170 --> 00:05:29,240
And while this is happening,

80
00:05:30,980 --> 00:05:34,370
while you were, when you came,
when you start to, when the,

81
00:05:34,371 --> 00:05:38,420
when the storm waves start
to come a little bit.

82
00:05:41,970 --> 00:05:42,150
Okay.

83
00:05:42,150 --> 00:05:44,370
What you can do is you can row the boat.

84
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:45,393
Yeah.

85
00:05:46,090 --> 00:05:47,090
Kuro the boat.
Well,

86
00:05:47,091 --> 00:05:52,090
and what I mean by that is start doing
something productive to get your mind

87
00:05:52,210 --> 00:05:57,200
moving forward. I don't know
how long this is, this, this is,

88
00:05:57,380 --> 00:06:02,210
you know,
when you feel a little bit of a break,

89
00:06:03,230 --> 00:06:06,440
then let's do it.
A few days go by,

90
00:06:07,220 --> 00:06:09,710
five days go by,
three days go by.

91
00:06:10,490 --> 00:06:13,130
At some point you can't cry anymore.
Okay,

92
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:15,890
let's do something productive.

93
00:06:16,310 --> 00:06:20,840
Let's sort out the drawers in the bedroom.
Let's back you.

94
00:06:21,050 --> 00:06:24,590
Let's finish a product.
Let's do something productive.

95
00:06:24,710 --> 00:06:27,170
And if there's something

96
00:06:29,130 --> 00:06:32,280
that distracts you, that's fine. Do it.

97
00:06:33,830 --> 00:06:37,760
Let, let, let there be
some calm in the water

98
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:45,680
and also as the, as the calm coms.

99
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:46,593
Yeah.

100
00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:47,480
Yeah.

101
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:50,210
Also you're going to find
moments where it's like you can,

102
00:06:50,270 --> 00:06:54,050
you can have things that are
going to bring on the waves

103
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:58,810
and that's okay to bring on the waves.

104
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:03,730
Go look at the pictures right
down the memories. Read the
letters, read the notes,

105
00:07:03,820 --> 00:07:08,320
read the emails,
remember?

106
00:07:11,260 --> 00:07:14,900
All right.
And then there's that standard service.

107
00:07:15,230 --> 00:07:18,200
You're going to do the memorial,
you're going to do the burial.

108
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:22,330
And when that's over,

109
00:07:25,690 --> 00:07:27,520
let a little bit of more time go by.

110
00:07:29,290 --> 00:07:30,760
Give yourself another week.

111
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:32,553
Yeah,

112
00:07:32,630 --> 00:07:33,890
of washing around

113
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:38,150
a feeling that sorrow
of letting the waves,

114
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:39,593
okay,

115
00:07:40,590 --> 00:07:42,240
toss you around in the ocean.

116
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:50,000
But after another week, what you do
is you go and you write a letter,

117
00:07:50,001 --> 00:07:54,500
you write a letter to your child.
Hey, can you explain to them,

118
00:07:57,880 --> 00:08:02,590
explain to them how
much they meant to you.

119
00:08:05,620 --> 00:08:10,620
Explain to them how heartbroken
you are that they are gone.

120
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:16,320
And then explain to them why
you are going to carry on.

121
00:08:20,190 --> 00:08:25,020
Why you are going to keep going
with them in your heart.

122
00:08:28,710 --> 00:08:33,710
Explain to them why you're not
going to dwell in their loss

123
00:08:40,290 --> 00:08:45,290
and explain to them how in losing them
you have learned without a shred of

124
00:08:46,471 --> 00:08:49,860
doubt,
how truly precious life is,

125
00:08:51,610 --> 00:08:53,590
and that they have taught you

126
00:08:56,740 --> 00:09:01,740
the immeasurable value of your own life
and your wife's life and your family's

127
00:09:02,531 --> 00:09:03,364
life.

128
00:09:09,890 --> 00:09:13,550
And explain to them that you know

129
00:09:16,470 --> 00:09:21,470
that you know that they loved you and
that you know that they would want more

130
00:09:22,081 --> 00:09:27,081
than anything for you to be happy and
productive and impactful in the world.

131
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:41,000
And explained in that letter what you
will do to make them proud of how you live

132
00:09:42,670 --> 00:09:43,503
your life.

133
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:55,730
And then take that letter
and go to their grave

134
00:09:59,540 --> 00:10:00,440
and read it to them

135
00:10:03,870 --> 00:10:04,703
and cry

136
00:10:07,660 --> 00:10:09,070
and kiss their soul

137
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:15,900
and tell them that you'll
see them on the other side

138
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:21,953
and then

139
00:10:24,030 --> 00:10:26,940
go live your life.

140
00:10:29,660 --> 00:10:31,160
And those waves are still gonna come

141
00:10:32,930 --> 00:10:35,900
and they're still going to be pain
and they're still going to be sorrow.

142
00:10:40,010 --> 00:10:43,610
But you go and live your
life and live it well

143
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:50,300
and make them proud.
