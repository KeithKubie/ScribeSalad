00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:14.080
I made a square hole in the sheet of paper,

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:16.320
and a coaster, a circular coaster.

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:19.605
I fold the paper in a mysterious fashion,

00:00:19.605 --> 00:00:22.515
and I can pass the coaster

00:00:22.515 --> 00:00:25.085
through the hole, really passes

00:00:25.085 --> 00:00:27.480
both directions, and I haven't started cheating.

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:31.095
It really is going through the hole. And yet

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:34.100
when I put these out, the diameter of the coaster

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:37.500
is bigger than the diagonal of the square hole.

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:40.080
What is going on? I didn't stretch and didn't tear.

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:43.380
And yet when I fold the sheet back,

00:00:43.385 --> 00:00:45.105
in a judicious way,

00:00:45.645 --> 00:00:47.575
the coaster does go through,

00:00:48.655 --> 00:00:50.795
the coaster which is bigger than the hole.

00:00:51.695 --> 00:00:54.425
How is this possible?

00:00:59.645 --> 00:01:02.505
I am willing to give away the secret for free,

00:01:02.505 --> 00:01:05.205
on this special occasion. It has to do with

00:01:05.205 --> 00:01:06.640
the interplay between,

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:11.340
the intrinsic, or inner dimension, of the sheet of paper

00:01:11.345 --> 00:01:14.275
which is 2 dimensions. And the fact that the sheet evolves

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:17.160
and flourishes in the ambient 3 dimensional space.

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:19.780
There is some elbow-room, there is some ambient space.

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:23.260
So dimension 2 and dimension 3. In the following sense.

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:27.100
First, I can fold the paper in a naive way like this,

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:28.840
in which case the largest gap

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:31.860
that I can try to pass the disc through, is this gap.

00:01:32.105 --> 00:01:34.465
That used to be, as you can see,

00:01:34.465 --> 00:01:36.995
the diagonal the square hole, and

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.620
that was too small for the disc to pass through.

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:42.600
But that's not the only thing that we do. Now, I take

00:01:42.605 --> 00:01:45.775
this sheet of paper, and start twisting it

00:01:45.775 --> 00:01:48.905
until those two sides get aligned

00:01:48.905 --> 00:01:51.855
into a straight line. And as I do this,

00:01:51.855 --> 00:01:54.685
as I twist the ends, you can see that the

00:01:54.685 --> 00:01:58.120
part of the paper starts raising above the floor.

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:00.240
That's escaping into the 3rd dimension,

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:02.740
taking advantage of the fact there is extra room there.

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:06.035
And when those two sides align completely

00:02:06.035 --> 00:02:08.915
then I can squash and crease. And, by the way,

00:02:08.915 --> 00:02:11.795
when I do that, I should shift by one

00:02:11.795 --> 00:02:14.565
in order to create this gap. Now the gap that we have

00:02:14.565 --> 00:02:17.705
created then is this gap, which is larger

00:02:17.705 --> 00:02:20.905
than the previous gap, because this gap used to be

00:02:21.025 --> 00:02:24.215
not the diagonal, but the sum of those two sides.

00:02:24.215 --> 00:02:26.265
And if you remember Pythagoras, you have

00:02:26.265 --> 00:02:29.405
gained an extra factor of square root of 2, which is a bit more than 40%.

00:02:29.405 --> 00:02:32.255
So the secret of success when you make this toy

00:02:32.355 --> 00:02:34.965
is to drill out the hole, so that the diagonal

00:02:34.965 --> 00:02:37.155
is slightly shorter than the diameter

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:38.840
of the disc which is for surprise,

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:42.920
but the sum of the two sides is slightly longer than this diameter.

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:44.445
And that's possible because there's

00:02:44.445 --> 00:02:46.560
that extra of window 40%.

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:49.880
And this is all possible, because when we

00:02:49.885 --> 00:02:52.875
do this maneuver, you're allowing the whole thing to come out

00:02:52.875 --> 00:02:55.295
into 3D, and then come back down.

00:02:55.295 --> 00:02:57.945
This fact that you can escape into the ambient

00:02:57.945 --> 00:03:00.335
3rd dimension and come back in, this

00:03:00.335 --> 00:03:02.915
extra journey that you are making into the extra degree of freedom

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:05.835
gives you this wonderful magic.
