00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:04.380
 Many of us have become quick to discover the delusions / visual tricks used to deceive our eyes - but how I thought there were 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:09.340
 There are illusions / audio tricks? Are you really able to trust your ears and the things you hear? 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:12.100
 For example, listen to Greg talking ... 

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:23.000
 What do you hear? If you heard "bar, bar, prevent 'you are right ... but, what about now? 

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:36.220
 There is a possibility that you heard 'away, away, away' this time, with 'F'. Except, you did not - in fact, we originally did not change the sound 

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:43.220
 Between the two videos. Despite what seems strange, what you hear depends on any video 

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:47.649
 I was relaying. Come on - rotate in every video watch and you'll see how that sound 

00:00:47.649 --> 00:00:54.399
 turns up. This is an excellent example of something called the McGurk effect, which shows how far 

00:00:54.399 --> 00:00:57.030
 Our vision can change what we believe we are hearing 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:02.699
 Now I want you to count how many times you see a circle flash on the screen. Let's do it 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:09.159
 one more time. Have you seen the flash twice? Many people did. However, without a voice, it 

00:01:09.159 --> 00:01:14.259
 It becomes clear that the circuit went only once. In this case, the sound may change 

00:01:14.259 --> 00:01:15.429
 You have vision perception. 

00:01:15.429 --> 00:01:19.329
 This next workout works best with others around you. I will play two tones and tell me 

00:01:19.329 --> 00:01:23.109
 Whether they are upward or downward. In other words, are the tones playing from the bottom up 

00:01:23.109 --> 00:01:25.500
 Or from top to bottom? listen to this. 

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:30.100
 Hey he? What about these? 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:36.429
 Write down what you heard for each number, and share your answer in the comments. the odds 

00:01:36.429 --> 00:01:40.779
 That you get different answers when comparing your answer with enough people will be great. Surprise? Try more. 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:45.700
 And this. 

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:48.779
 How can you hear something different from 

00:01:48.779 --> 00:01:53.759
 Others? It's the illusion / audio phishing called the paradox of Tritone. We have been designed 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:57.899
 The nangmas so that they contain both the highest and lowest frequencies in them, but our minds have them 

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:02.149
 A certain preference to listen to either. Diana Deutsch, designed this trick, found it 

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:06.559
 That geography and language of childhood all play a role in determining this preference. 

00:02:06.559 --> 00:02:11.500
 Finally, listen to this soundtrack of the melody gradually rising. 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:23.500
 However, if you are running the same 

00:02:23.599 --> 00:02:28.650
 Exactly again, it will look like it's continuing to rise higher and higher. 

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:33.819
 I swear to you that this is exactly the same section, you can repeat this part of 

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:38.269
 More and more video and check your own. Try it! Each time you play the melody 

00:02:38.269 --> 00:02:43.629
 Apparently the mounts are higher. This is called the Shepard tone of musical deception, which it has 

00:02:43.629 --> 00:02:47.829
 Many variations. In it, many linear waves are played one above the other in one package played waves on one top and another lift 

00:02:47.829 --> 00:02:52.939
 , While one quickly drops down to the octave with the continued rise of others. But 

00:02:52.939 --> 00:02:57.189
 Our brain does not notice this drop, so these passages seem to be rising ... forever! 

00:02:57.189 --> 00:03:01.459
 These tricks may help explain how something like music can have a profound and uneven effect 

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:06.150
 Our minds, we discussed in our new AsapTHOUGHT episode here, along with the question 

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:10.299
 Music can save your life. There is a link in the description to see it! 

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:13.900
 So ... Do you still trust your ears? 

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:18.500
 You have a pressing question you want him to answer? Ask him in comments or on Facebook or Twitter.
