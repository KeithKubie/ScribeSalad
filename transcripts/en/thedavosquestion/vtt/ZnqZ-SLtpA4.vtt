Ngozi: Hi YouTube, this is Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala,
I'm an agent director of the world bank.

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:12.949
I'm talking today about investing in girls
and the girls effect.

00:00:12.949 --> 00:00:19.460
This video, a girl called Anita challenged
all of us to think of how specifically we

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:24.140
can help to invest in girls and make sure
that girls get the opportunity that she was

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:29.690
denied earlier on in her life.
I think we need to do this at every level.

00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:37.039
At individual level each one of us alleged
to be better off can commit to try and find

00:00:37.039 --> 00:00:42.390
a girl, a group of girls in a developing country
where they are not so privileged that they

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:48.039
can help to make their lives better.
You can do that through working with an NGO.

00:00:48.039 --> 00:00:53.749
There are many reputable NGO's who are committed
to helping girls, and I'm sure you can find

00:00:53.749 --> 00:00:57.850
who they are online.
We should do that through institutions such

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:01.449
as mine.
The World Bank is very very focused on girls.

00:01:01.449 --> 00:01:04.530
We believe that investing in girls is investing
in development.

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:10.610
If you invest in girls, they are at the bottom,
top and middle of everything.

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:15.980
They can make a difference in climate change,
in population, in reducing poverty, in all

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:19.350
the millennium development goals that we are
so interested in.

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:24.130
So institutions should commit and the World
Bank is committed.

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:29.780
We have a very good initiative; the focus
is adolescent girls in conflict and fragile

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:33.390
states because we believe that they deserve
tremendous attention.

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:37.960
If you look at most of these states, many
of the girls are not in school.

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:41.380
In Southern Sudan, only 1% of the girls finish
primary school.

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:45.700
So we are committed to change this and to
make â€“ help the governments make a difference

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:52.480
in these girls lives.
So the question I have for you YouTube communities

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:56.070
is what are you going to do after you listen
to me talk?

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:01.659
After you hear the story of Anita.
After you think about the issue of girls

00:02:01.659 --> 00:02:07.760
After you reflect on the fact that of the
130 million children out of school, 70% are

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:10.200
girls.
What are you individually going to commit

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:12.580
to do?
Thank you. I'd love to hear from you.
