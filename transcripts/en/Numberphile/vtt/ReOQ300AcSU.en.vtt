00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.300
If you were really smart

00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:03.103
you wouldn't need a calculator

00:00:03.303 --> 00:00:04.437
to know there was something wrong...

00:00:04.637 --> 00:00:07.610
"Fermat's Last Theorem &amp; Homer Simpson"
Numberphile
Films by Brady Haran

00:00:07.810 --> 00:00:11.464
There was a short story called
The Devil and Simon Flagg,

00:00:11.664 --> 00:00:14.380
where Simon Flagg makes a deal
with the devil

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:17.077
and part of the deal is
that he can keep his soul

00:00:17.277 --> 00:00:19.489
if the devil can prove
Fermat's Last Theorem.

00:00:19.689 --> 00:00:21.460
Of Course, the devil can't prove
Fermat's Last Theorem.

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:23.354
Fermat's Last Theorem crops up
in Star Trek

00:00:23.554 --> 00:00:26.446
x^n+y^n=z^n.

00:00:26.646 --> 00:00:28.219
It crops up in Dr Who - 
The eleventh doctor

00:00:28.419 --> 00:00:32.761
in order to prove himself
rewrites Fermat's original proof.

00:00:32.961 --> 00:00:36.740
It pops up in Bedazzled,
the film with Liz Hurley,

00:00:37.126 --> 00:00:38.587
where she plays the devil as well.

00:00:38.787 --> 00:00:40.311
So there's quite a
devilish link to Fermat.

00:00:40.547 --> 00:00:43.505
It pops up in Arcadia
played by Tom Stoppard.

00:00:43.705 --> 00:00:47.563
So, it's very much a bit of math
that people can use

00:00:47.763 --> 00:00:49.953
in novels and films and plays,

00:00:50.153 --> 00:00:52.725
because it's sort of has
a bit of glamour around it,

00:00:52.925 --> 00:00:55.591
and people have perhaps vaguely heard of it.

00:00:55.791 --> 00:00:59.162
Recently I spotted it in an episode
of The Simpsons.

00:00:59.362 --> 00:01:03.863
There's an episode called
"The Wizard of Evergreen Terrace",

00:01:04.063 --> 00:01:07.104
where Homer Simpson wants
to become an inventor,

00:01:07.304 --> 00:01:09.798
and he has a blackboard.

00:01:09.998 --> 00:01:11.519
We see him scribbling things
on the blackboard.

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:15.237
And one of the equations
Homer Simpson writes on the blackboard

00:01:16.152 --> 00:01:19.919
is an apparent solution
to Fermat's Last Theorem.

00:01:20.127 --> 00:01:22.150
It's some 4-digit number to the 12'th power

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:23.809
plus a 4 digit number to the 12'th power

00:01:24.009 --> 00:01:26.125
equals a 4-dight number to the 12'th power.

00:01:26.325 --> 00:01:28.835
Now, Fermat's Last Theorem says
that should not exist.

00:01:29.035 --> 00:01:34.767
So, Homer is defying
Fermat and Andrew Wiles.

00:01:34.967 --> 00:01:38.993
Now, if you have an old phone calculator
and you type in the digits,

00:01:39.193 --> 00:01:43.301
and you check Homer's solution,
which should not exist,

00:01:43.501 --> 00:01:46.147
it turns out it's a perfect
valid solution.

00:01:46.347 --> 00:01:47.815
BRADY HARAN: Hang on a second,
this is a problem...

00:01:48.015 --> 00:01:52.692
SIMON SINGH: [laughs] This is a big problem.
Um, the solution to the problem is...

00:01:52.892 --> 00:01:54.696
It's called a near miss solution,

00:01:54.896 --> 00:01:58.192
which means that
if you've got a phone calculator

00:01:58.392 --> 00:02:01.103
with only 10 decimal places
you won't see the problem.

00:02:01.303 --> 00:02:05.315
But if you go to 15 or 20
decimal places

00:02:05.515 --> 00:02:09.338
you'll see that the equation
doesn't quite balance.

00:02:09.538 --> 00:02:11.597
It's very very close
but not quite there.

00:02:11.797 --> 00:02:26.649
His solution is
3,987^12+4,365^12=4,472^12

00:02:26.849 --> 00:02:28.342
Try that at your phone calculator

00:02:28.542 --> 00:02:29.791
it will kind of make sense.

00:02:29.991 --> 00:02:32.606
It's not the only near miss
in The Simpsons.

00:02:32.806 --> 00:02:35.096
There's another one in an episode called
"Homer Cubed"

00:02:35.296 --> 00:02:39.456
which is part of the
"Treehouse of Horror VI" episode of The Simpsons.

00:02:39.656 --> 00:02:42.837
And when I saw the second one
I remember thinking:

00:02:43.037 --> 00:02:47.365
There's somebody on The Simpsons
who clearly likes math.

00:02:47.565 --> 00:02:51.769
And the culprit is a chap called
David X. Cohen.

00:02:51.969 --> 00:02:55.307
David X. Cohen did physics at Harvard.

00:02:55.507 --> 00:02:58.098
I did physics as well,
and physicists like math,

00:02:58.298 --> 00:03:01.940
so that kind of explains
David's obsession with mathematics.

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:04.485
He then did a Master's degree in
Computer Science,

00:03:04.685 --> 00:03:07.832
and then went on and published research
papers in mathematics.

00:03:08.032 --> 00:03:11.170
In fact, there is a whole area
of mathematics known as "pancake flipping",

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:12.485
which is a whole other story.

00:03:12.685 --> 00:03:16.818
But David X. Cohen is
a serious mathematician

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:18.766
who finds his way into The Simpsons.

00:03:18.966 --> 00:03:23.894
And so every so often in The Simpsons
he would drop in little bits of mathematics.

00:03:24.094 --> 00:03:28.989
When David X. Cohen drops in these
false solutions to Fermat's Last Theorem,

00:03:29.219 --> 00:03:34.205
he is kind of nodding back to his past
and his love of mathematics.

00:03:34.405 --> 00:03:39.291
And the really weird thing is he's
not the only mathematician on The Simpsons.

00:03:39.491 --> 00:03:43.097
There is Al Jean
who did mathematics at Harvard.

00:03:43.306 --> 00:03:46.448
There's a guy called Ken Keeler,
who has a Ph.D. in Applied Math.

00:03:46.725 --> 00:03:49.458
There's a guy called Mike Reiss,

00:03:49.829 --> 00:03:52.749
who is corresponding with
the great mathematician Martin Gardner,

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:54.760
the great recreational mathematician
Martin Gardner,

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:55.803
when he was a young kid.

00:03:56.003 --> 00:03:58.298
So there are a lot of mathematicians
on The Simpsons,

00:03:58.498 --> 00:04:02.176
and they all drop in bits of math
in The Simpsons.

00:04:02.376 --> 00:04:04.033
BRADY HARAN: What should we
read into the fact

00:04:04.233 --> 00:04:06.887
that all these mathematicians
are on The Simpsons writing stuff?

00:04:07.087 --> 00:04:12.187
SIMON SINGH: It's tricky. I spoke to them,
I met them last year.

00:04:12.387 --> 00:04:18.925
And I said to them: "Why have you all
ended up as being comedy writers?"

00:04:19.125 --> 00:04:21.194
And they gave me various theories.

00:04:21.394 --> 00:04:23.302
One theory that many of them share

00:04:23.502 --> 00:04:25.250
is that mathematicians love logic,

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:30.464
and therefore they love breaking logic
and playing with logic,

00:04:30.664 --> 00:04:34.223
and they love the illogical,
and a lot of humor is based on that.

00:04:34.423 --> 00:04:37.304
One explanation that Al Jean gave me

00:04:37.504 --> 00:04:40.398
as to why they work
in animation, in particular,

00:04:40.598 --> 00:04:43.198
is that animation is all about control.

00:04:43.398 --> 00:04:47.315
What you storyboard, what you script
appears on screen.

00:04:47.701 --> 00:04:51.787
In mathematics what you write down
on paper is what happens.

00:04:51.987 --> 00:04:56.579
We can contrast that with
a real action sitcom,

00:04:56.779 --> 00:04:59.962
where you don't have control.

00:05:00.162 --> 00:05:02.036
You know, the actors put in their ideas,

00:05:02.236 --> 00:05:05.085
scripts will change, scenes will change,
everything is up for grabs.

00:05:05.285 --> 00:05:07.225
And science is a bit like that as well.

00:05:07.425 --> 00:05:09.078
When you do a science experiment
things change,

00:05:09.278 --> 00:05:11.236
things go wrong,
test tubes break, etc.

00:05:11.436 --> 00:05:13.890
So there does seem to be
a very strong link

00:05:14.117 --> 00:05:15.914
between mathematicians and comedy,

00:05:16.114 --> 00:05:19.462
and mathematicians who write comedy,
who then work in animation.

00:05:19.662 --> 00:05:21.251
When we took our near misses,

00:05:21.451 --> 00:05:25.860
we're looking at..., kind of proportionally,
is at a near miss.

00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:28.669
So, we're looking at 4-digit numbers
to the 12'th power.

00:05:28.869 --> 00:05:31.631
So we're looking at 48-digit numbers.

00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:35.024
And so if they're out
by millions of millions,

00:05:35.224 --> 00:05:36.817
that's only a tiny amount,

00:05:37.017 --> 00:05:38.929
because we're looking at
such massive digits.

00:05:39.129 --> 00:05:43.256
And, so, on most calculators
you won't see the error.

00:05:43.456 --> 00:05:46.266
If you were really smart,
you wouldn't need a calculator

00:05:46.483 --> 00:05:48.594
to know there was something wrong
in one of these.

00:05:48.794 --> 00:05:51.585
If you look at the second one,
now this one is obviously wrong.

00:05:51.785 --> 00:05:55.390
Now, the reason it's obviously wrong is
because this is an even number,

00:05:55.590 --> 00:05:58.596
that's an odd number,
that's an even number.

00:05:58.796 --> 00:06:02.080
An even number to the 12'th power
must still be an even number.

00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:04.648
An odd number to the 12'th power
must be an odd number.

00:06:04.848 --> 00:06:08.419
An even number plus an odd number
is an odd number.

00:06:08.619 --> 00:06:11.243
So that cannot equal that.

00:06:11.443 --> 00:06:12.924
BRADY HARAN: You were talking about
this near miss,

00:06:13.264 --> 00:06:14.742
or these two near misses that
were put in,

00:06:14.942 --> 00:06:18.557
Is he paying tribute to something here?

00:06:18.757 --> 00:06:20.452
Or is he trolling?
Is he being a troll?

00:06:20.733 --> 00:06:23.668
SIMON SINGH: No, it's very much...

00:06:23.868 --> 00:06:26.356
When you love something,

00:06:26.556 --> 00:06:28.952
and I thing David X. Cohen
loves comedy,

00:06:29.152 --> 00:06:30.592
he loves comedy writing
and he loves mathematics,

00:06:30.792 --> 00:06:33.422
it's natural to try and bring
the two together.

00:06:33.622 --> 00:06:34.504
You don't force them together.

00:06:34.704 --> 00:06:37.759
And the mathematics on The Simpsons
never gets in the way of the plot.

00:06:37.959 --> 00:06:41.153
But if there is an opportunity
to drop something in that you love...

00:06:41.353 --> 00:06:44.426
In the very first episode of The Simpsons

00:06:44.626 --> 00:06:48.959
one of the kids has a lunch box
with Anatoly Karpov's picture on it.

00:06:49.159 --> 00:06:53.361
Now, I remember Anatoly Karpov
as a great chess player of the early 70's.

00:06:53.561 --> 00:06:56.627
Now, I guess somebody on The Simpsons
writing team is also a fan of chess,

00:06:56.827 --> 00:06:58.417
and also a fan of Anatoly Karpov.

00:06:58.617 --> 00:07:02.605
And so these things get dropped in.

00:07:02.805 --> 00:07:05.689
And as there were so many
mathematical writers on The Simpsons,

00:07:05.917 --> 00:07:08.842
they dropped in an awful lot of
these mathematical knobs.

00:07:11.542 --> 00:07:13.606
Brady Haran: If you like to help
Simon buy some new monkeys

00:07:13.806 --> 00:07:15.035
to hang on those bookshelves of his,

00:07:15.235 --> 00:07:16.905
why don't you have a look at his book?

00:07:17.105 --> 00:07:20.211
It's out this week,
it's all about mathematics in The Simpsons,

00:07:20.411 --> 00:07:23.799
Of course, I'll put a link so you can check out
the book in the video description.

00:07:23.999 --> 00:07:28.034
There will also be links to our other videos
about Fermat's Last Theorem,

00:07:28.234 --> 00:07:30.631
that we filmed with Simon and released
earlier this week,

00:07:30.831 --> 00:07:34.831
And lastly, I'm also including a link to
a Sixty Symbols video I uploaded this week,

00:07:35.031 --> 00:07:38.224
all about the physics of water balloons
and filming them in slow motion.

00:07:38.424 --> 00:07:41.108
It's really good, and I know
a lot of people were having problems

00:07:41.308 --> 00:07:43.805
with their subscription boxes
on YouTube this week.

00:07:44.005 --> 00:07:45.340
So, if you subscribe
to Sixty Symbols,

00:07:45.540 --> 00:07:47.998
which is like our sister channel
but about physics,

00:07:48.198 --> 00:07:51.451
and you missed that one,
well, now you've got no excuse.
