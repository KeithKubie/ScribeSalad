Speaker 1:          00:01          Hello freak bitches. Amen. Did you hear that Nate Diaz wants $20 million for the rematch with Connor? Is he and he should get 20 to 30 million. Do you think that it's, how many paper view buys? Do you think that that fight would be worth? 1.5 now. Yeah. Maybe. Maybe more now. Maybe more now. Cause let me ask you this, Joe. What, what let's say Nate fought, let's say Nate fights the winner of Kevin Lee. Tony Ferguson, and they're the main event pay-per-view. How many paper you biases Nate Diaz do without Connor? Well, not as many. Not even close. Not even close, right? It's, it's a big kind of thing. But the big fight for Connor is Nate. Like if Conor fought Kevin Lee, how many pay-per-views would he get? [inaudible] he might. You're right. You look up all condoms writes, he's never done less than a million ever. You're right. So he's the Floyd Mayweather MMA. Now we freeze. Oh God dammit. Fight. Goddammit. Fipass son of a bitch. Conspiracy theory. Snoop cat, bitch. It's Snoop cast. Okay. They fucked us. We're sitting here frozen outlet persona.

Speaker 1:          01:14          We will, Oh my God. Oh, we're back in low. Done. No, it's dead. It's dead again. We've got a streaming issue. Some shit is going down or there's such a demand for this. It's fucked up. Like Mayweather, McGregor, they don't know how to handle the overload. They'll expect it. 50 people and they got a hundred total. How dare you. Yeah, this is ridiculous. Um, yeah, but I think Nate, rightfully so, she gets that fights can be the biggest paper of all time. I really do. I think the trilogies can be because of, for MMA, for MMA framing may because of the commerce. Right? He's bigger than ever. Biggest combat sports bad. That's poor guy. The ref gave him that cut. But with Nate, I think that the fight that the, that's the thing with this fight and that's why I don't think you're gonna see it happen very soon.

Speaker 1:          02:05          Cause both Nate and Connor realize how much power they have and you can't just go from with the old rules anymore. They liked the, the Connor is changed the dynamics of the fight game for the better for the fighters. It's a great thing. It is a great thing. I just wonder like how much knee can actually get. Definitely. Cause what they say. I think report said between the two fights, he made around 2.5 million to fight him twice. Now he made 2 million plus to fight him both times. Both times. So it's 4 million. So 4 million total. That's what I'm reading. I did not talk to Nate. I did not talk to you. I read this. So I thought I made two maybe. Yeah, you might be right. Maybe I miss quoted that. So maybe it's two and two or two and a half. Two and a half.

Speaker 1:          02:45          Either way. So let's say made four minutes, right? There's no way in the world you can say, Hey Nate, fight Connor. And the biggest fight of all time trilogy, Tom's gonna get 40 million during it. Two and a half. Again, there's no way that happens. Both guys realize the man to have this fight and he made $4 million in a year. So how much money does he have leftover? You probably got $1 million plus just sitting in the bank doing nothing. So what do you, you know what I'm saying? So the dynamics have shifted towards the fighters for first time. Now if you the UFC, how do you make this work with Connor? Because he's not fighting guys anymore for five 10 million. You can't, when you have over a hundred million dollars in the bank and the biggest star of all time, what do you think the most Connor's made in a UFC fight is?

Speaker 1:          03:31          10 mil PRI you think so 10 12 milk max. So now you think he can get like probably like 30 at least right at leap ends on how many paper have you buys otherwise why are you doing it? What if he gets like, what if Nate and Connor gets 3 million pay-per-views it's not out of the question. It's not, it's a stretch stretch. But if Nate can talk the right amount of shit, you know, and people get excited about, honestly right now for Connor, what else is there that's even close? The first fight in MMA. What else does? The only argument is you can say Connor's the only drawl. He can fight Billy from Afghanistan and still get 2 million paper. You buys are breaking Millie. You let Conor fight Pauline mal and Naji and Dublin. See if I'm Connor and I have met Gregor promotions, I'm going, wait a second, I'm gonna fight this monster.

Speaker 1:          04:24          Nate Diaz. He won't pay me 10 million. You wear Reeboks or I'm just going to go to Dublin. Me and Polly sell this 70,000 state amount. I'm just gonna take all of it. You have to. He goes, Whoa, Hey, Hey, do that. He's still got some sort of a, they must have some sites coming up. Boats. They have some sort of a deal for boxing too. You know they have that Zuph a boxing shirt that Dana was wearing. I might be looking at my skeptical hip eyes, like the shirt. I'd rock it myself cause I do funds. However, a McGregor promotions I'd assume is Connor's thing. Really. You think he's in cahoots with the, with the UFC? I would think he has to be. I don't think he would make a deal with McGregor promotions. I think he made a deal with what he's saying. You can buy that suit for Fox zoo, for boxing t-shirt.

Speaker 1:          05:12          25 bucks. Why does it say Dana white, Z for boxing tee? Does Dana white come with it? It's false. Every teacher of him, this is fake news. Um, I'd rock that Lockton pay by the way. Um, I would imagine he has some sort of a deal. Okay, so let's say you have a deal. Think about this Joe. So let's say Connor and Dana have a deal with the McGregor promotions. They're like, I your next fight we're going to co-promote with you. [inaudible] well, how's that gonna work now? So then you promote this huge fight and Nate's like, hold up if he's going to make all this money, like I know where we're in cahoots with him. That's the way you mean for the UFC? No, I don't think it would co-promote for the UFC. No, but I think it would co-promote if you had a Pauline Mala Naji boxing match and doable and in fucking Dublin [inaudible] me, Britain. Do you want to see that? You've been, I want to see everything, dude. I want to see snail's race.

Speaker 1:          06:08          That's still ridiculous. The, the fight is then a Diaz fight. That's the fight. That's the fight. But is it the fight as far as the business? Cause if Kannan learned anything from Floyd, you know that when you fight Floyd Floyd's the businessman, he's his own promoter. He's everything. Comma has his own promotional. Now he's the businessman now. So cotton's going, listen, what are we doing here? What do you guys want to do? Maybe if the UFC contract, the Connor has runs out, maybe they make some new, crazy, ridiculous look at it. That contract doesn't matter if it's out or not. The game has changed. Interesting. Yeah, you don't, there's no way you, you keep going with that current contract. No way. Just found this byte. McGregor, sports and entertainment limited. The notorious Conor McGregor and notorious. Why did you pull that up? I don't give a fuck this little company that it's officially exists and they own these things and it's all Connor stuff. Yeah, it's registered in his name. Not mean it could be like a tee shirt company.

Speaker 1:          07:09          It could be, but it's all these tech, I don't know. Whatever. Sure. I'm sure he's got something. I mean, must have some sort of a, but also Dana white. I don't know about the guys that don't meet with Dana. White's not stupid enough to let Connor do all this and not be involved in it. He's only really sure. Make your own thing, man. Do your thing buddy. There's no way. Hmm. Interesting. I know. Interesting. Either way. Whatever he does. Interesting. I know. I would like to see them box Paul. And while Nate just keeps eating tacos and going to Cabo doing tequila shots, I really liked the fight's going to go away. It's not going to go away. I disagree. Know fights around the year that you think that it's so, I don't know, man. I think if Nate wants to just chill and just train and have a good time.

Speaker 1:          07:53          The fights there in a year? I don't think so. I think if Connor stays active, I guess with Nate, what's, how are you going to stay in the limelight? Yeah, he's fighting Nate Diaz again. Uh, they fought over two years ago. Kind of hikes, not there. Paulie Malignaggi in a boxing match in Dublin, Ireland. Legit possibility to get a win over a two time world champ. World champion in the second poxy fight ever two boxing fights ever. Two world champions making bank. Come on, son balling. How much, say how much ball was stupid? How much money do you think you would get for that fight though? Not nearly as many more money. They he'd get fight in eight tiers with a tougher challenge. Right? So like what do you think the paper view would be for a Paulie Malignaggi fight? What would even be a million bars for sure.

Speaker 1:          08:43          See, that's the thing. Comic con could play fucking in a celebrity softball game right now. A lot of people are going to buy that bitch. You know what I'm saying? So him fighting Paulie and there's all this heat, people are like, God, he did well against Floyd. We could see him being poly. I'd say at least a million. And if it's your own promotion, what do you make? 30 30 40 mil, right? Hmm. Interesting. Interesting. Bring your balls. CARNA bring your balls. He, but now Paul enlist. Everyone knows. I probably wouldn't help Paul. He's talking shit to all the UFC. Well he should shut the fuck up cause if you wanted to have a UFC fight, he can go over there and get his brain kicked in. Yeah, you don't want that in his mind. Stop talking. You're a boxer. You're very good boxer. Just shut your mouth.

Speaker 1:          09:27          Just just go after. There's literally a million people in the world that could grab you and strangle the life out of you and there's not a goddamn thing you can do about it. Correct. Sorry dude. Like the UFC is not what you want it and you just don't, your gun don't talk shit. You will. They will give you a wrestler and he will punch your fucking face into pulp. Well he's not a goddamn thing you can do about it. No, not a God damn thing. You think he went towards Tony Ferguson? That's probably way he's thick right now, but what's his weight class like? 45 45 47 yeah. How about you? You give him Ricardo Lopez.

Speaker 1:          10:05          How about you give yai Rodriguez? How about that? I mean, yeah, you don't want that. Yeah. God, look at the [inaudible]. Give him a guy that's not the top of the food. Don't give him Frankie Edgar. Don't give him Josie Aldo. You don't need to do that. You know who he could beat up though? Oh, cm punk. You'd start seeing punk probably fucked him up or cut the fuck up. Imagine what max Holloway would do. The poly Mala Noche in an MMA fight. Just imagine, just try to just try to wrap your head around the kind of ass fucking, I think max went at him on Twitter. Like [inaudible] would literally kill him. He, if he wanted to want it to literally kill him. I mean, so it comes Watson. So what a lot of guys are out there doing a boxing match against not so good, not so good.

Speaker 1:          10:54          Max has the best shot. I think max has amazing footwork and he's a good striker. Very, very good striker. Is that excellent time and good discipline and his endurance is phenomenal. Cody Garbrandt might have something to say. Even at 45 you'd come and fight Pauly. Be interesting. Be interesting. But Manoj is a legit world champion pro boxer. He's a fucking smart dude. He's a very smart guy. He's one of the best analysts in the gay. Like you probably doesn't need to do all this. Yeah, well that was one of the things that people were super concerned about. Him sparring with Connor. Like he did two 12 round sparring matches with Connor and Connor. He did a eight round and a 12 round eight round to him. And Connor was, you know, landing some, obviously some fucking hard shots. Just one. What we know when we definitely saw that one straight left, that fucking clanged him right dead center in the mug and you see the sparks fly.

Speaker 1:          11:40          But also to Paulie's defense. This was telling Paul like, dude, let's say I'm retired. So let's say Cain Velasquez was a case shop. I need you to help me tram it. I need you to come help. Give me some rounds. That's not a free ride right there. That punch. Fuck no, that's not a free ride. That is the only space we can rough that. That is your face getting crushed. But here's the thing, if I got off the plane, even from LA to San Jose and Cain wants some rounds, it Ken goes, Hey bro, I need you to go five fives. That ain't happening. I'm here to help you. Ain't no damn you. Five, five, one realm set on the side. And coach was a lot of ego shit going on there. I think Connor's team brought Paul in to fuck him up. That's the reason. And to go, if he does fuck him up, we're blasted out there cause the sell the flight more.

Speaker 1:          12:20          Yeah. And that was the other thing that he said, um, about that is like, Paul was like, you'd never go 12 rounds like that. He's like, you never heard of why you didn't go 12 rounds. Never even in MMA, I've never heard of someone get off the plane, go on five fires. What basically gave him a practice fight. That's it. And it was, it was smaller cars parked because confidence builder, it also solidified him, shit, I'm gonna fuck her can box a little bit. And then Dana blasts it out. You know, I think it was good. It was very smart, obviously. I'll see it worked. Obviously it worked. Yeah. Six and a half million pay-per-view buys super balls. You've created an animal. You've paid an animal for you. The UFC, the hammer, the God to what else the fuck they have. What else do they have?

Speaker 1:          13:02          Strew versus Covello. I want to see the full video. I want to give Paul. He has full do. You can see the full video where you probably could get it and watch it, but don't blast it up until everybody. Because if you do that, then you don't have a fight in Dublin town. Everybody. Oh man. You know what I'm saying? What? It was like you can't cause let's say Connor starched him for 12 rounds. Well then that fucks up the paper. You buy it. Then we're like, wait, no. Of course he's going to beat him bullet. If he didn't. What if Paulie's telling the truth would if a Polly's getting the most of them. See that's why we want this debate. So you buy the paper view. If you're calling me on Tuesday, that ass kicking. You know what I'm saying? Like, you can't that tapes out though, but you can't release it cause it's gonna fuck up the fight.

Speaker 1:          13:42          Maybe see when the security guards were getting in his face, it's like, relax dude, I'm a fighter. Yeah, you just come out. I'm a fighter. That guy kicked him out. That's what the fuck you do. That's hilarious. Yeah. He's like, I'm trying to hype up a fight. Then he almost got in a fight during the, uh, when we're doing a, uh, pre show, cause the fans were just fucking relentless. Irish fans were just harassing them. And then the guy goes, Paulie, I'll kick your ass worse than Conor McGregor did. And then finally Paul, he goes, fuck this, take this things off. Goes at him. And so then, uh, Brian, uh, gets between them. Brian, the calm Taylor with the shaved head. And so he's like, no, no, probably don't do this. And the guy's like, do something. I'll give you a worse beaten. McGregor did in the, you know, his Irish accent, poly can't get, don't buy us, spit on him. And then it was chaos. Scary. Scary for sure. Getting security earlier in that though.
