00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:13.760
The Joker is one of the most iconic and popular
villains in history.

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:19.020
And we're not just referring to the history
of comic books when we say that - Batman's

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:23.220
arch-enemy stands up alongside the likes of
Professor Moriarty, Darth Vader, The Wicked

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:27.080
Witch of the West, Cruella de Vil and the
Devil himself as one of the most recognizable

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:31.641
bad guys in fiction.As a result of his popularity,
there have been countless adaptations of the

00:00:31.641 --> 00:00:33.700
character across various media platforms.

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:38.090
As well as appearing in comic books and graphic
novels, The Joker has appeared on television,

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:42.160
in movies, in video games and on all manner
of merchandise and paraphernalia.In terms

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:46.090
of mainstream versions of the character, the
ones that have appeared in movies are undoubtedly

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:50.100
the most well known, and it's pretty amazing
how fresh the character has remained in each

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:54.520
depiction - and this video is going to run
through them in chronological order, discussing

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:56.730
each version and how they differ from each
other.

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:01.680
Welcome to The Evolution of The Joker on the
big screen.

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.670
Cesar Romero
The late Cesar Romero was the first man to

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:08.750
portray the Clown Prince of Gotham in live
action on the big screen, reprising his role

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:12.190
from the Batman television series in a 1966
movie.

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:16.520
In the movie, The Joker teamed up with The
Penguin, The Riddler and Catwoman to form

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:22.860
the United Underworld - a quartet that posed
a very significant threat to Adam West's Batman

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:26.550
and Burt Ward's Robin.This version of The
Joker was the lightest of them all - which

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:30.920
was fitting with the era and the tone of the
television series and movie in which he appeared.

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:35.670
He was unashamedly camp, wore a bright pink
suit, and was more like a pantomime villain

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:40.740
than a ruthless criminal overlord.He first
appeared in the TV episode "The Joker is Wild"

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:44.740
and made his last appearance in the episode
entitled "The Jokerâ€™s Flying Saucer".

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:49.410
In between those, he appeared in twenty more
episodes, as well as the aforementioned movie.

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:53.640
As he appeared more, his schemes and gadgets
got more and more crazy and elaborate - and

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:59.070
he even had his own version of Batman's utility
belt, which held devices with names like "strangling

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:03.470
screamers" in it.Incidentally, Romero refused
to shave his moustache for this role, so The

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:07.960
Joker's white face makeup was simply heavily
smeared over it whenever he played the character.

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:11.880
He remains one of the most memorable versions
of the character to this day, in spite of

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:17.450
the fact that he last appeared 48 years ago.

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:20.860
Jack Nicholson
In 1989, the man who was clearly born to play

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:24.560
The Joker took on the role of the character
- and he did so brilliantly.

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:28.550
That man was, of course, Jack Nicholson, and
he made his one and only appearance as the

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:30.450
character in Tim Burton's Batman.

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:34.100
The Joker had appeared on the small screen
in numerous animated series since Romero's

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:39.440
version had last been seen, but this live
action, big screen return was long overdue.Nicholson's

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:43.500
Joker still possessed an element of campness
- you could clearly see the influence of Cesar

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:47.841
Romero - but Burton and Nicholson took the
character down a much darker route.This version

00:02:47.841 --> 00:02:52.230
was violent and temperamental and, even when
he was being light and funny, those moments

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:55.430
would be juxtaposed with acts of physical
brutality.

00:02:55.430 --> 00:03:00.070
In the same vein, his bright purple suit and
constant sickly smile were in stark contrast

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:04.760
to the drab and very grey version of Gotham
City created by Burton for this movie - something

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:09.250
that gave the character an edge and made him
even more unsettling.His line "have you ever

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:13.490
danced with the devil by the pale moonlight"
has become one of the most iconic in cinema

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:16.870
history and defines Nicholson's interpretation
brilliantly.

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:20.970
Many still argue that this version is the
definitive Joker, but that's simply a matter

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:22.140
of opinion.

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:24.810
Mark Hamill
Although this video is mainly focusing on

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:29.010
live action adaptations of the character,
no such video would be complete without mentioning

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:33.130
Mark Hamill's animated version of The Joker.The
Star Wars legend has loaned his voice to the

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:38.470
character since 1992 - commencing with Batman:
The Animated Series - but his credits extend

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:43.260
to a variety of other DC-based cartoons, and
indeed three movies.The first movie in which

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:48.500
Hamill's Joker appeared was 1993's Batman:
Mask of the Phantasm, which got a theatrical

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:52.710
release, but he has also appeared in the direct-to-video
Batman Beyond: Return of the Joker from the

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:57.569
year 2000, and he will reprise the role in
the eagerly anticipated Batman: The Killing

00:03:57.569 --> 00:04:00.630
Joke, which will also go straight-to-video
in the summer of 2016.

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:04.950
In addition to those productions, he has voiced
the character for various theme park attractions

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:09.560
and video games.Hamill's Joker clearly took
influence from both Romero and Nicholson's

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:15.020
portrayals of the character, combining laughter,
campness, mayhem, totally crazy schemes, wickedness

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:16.020
and dark humour brilliantly.

00:04:16.020 --> 00:04:19.780
He looks very different to any version of
the character that came before him - although

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:23.790
he does still wear the signature purple suit
- and Hamill has received almost universal

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:25.919
praise for his voice work with the character.

00:04:25.919 --> 00:04:29.690
Heath Ledger
The Dark Knight Trilogy was a huge success.

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:33.690
Christopher Nolan brought a level of gritty
realism to the world of Batman that had never

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:37.770
been attempted before with Batman Begins,
The Dark Knight and The Dark Knight Rises

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:40.310
between 2005 and 2012.

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:44.770
But the highlight of the trilogy was undoubtedly
the late Heath Ledger's portrayal of The Joker.His

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:48.770
sole appearance came in The Dark Knight, in
which he was depicted as a sociopath and a

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:50.510
bringer of pure chaos.

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:54.710
He was completely reimagined and his appearance
was far more rugged and shabby than that of

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:59.080
any version of the character seen before and,
frankly, he was the darkest, most unpredictable

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:03.810
and most violent version as well.To prepare
for the role, Ledger reportedly locked himself

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:08.500
away in a hotel room for weeks; perfecting
his mannerisms, totally immersing himself

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:09.500
in the character.

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:13.590
Some people have theorised that getting inside
the head of such a maniacal character contributed

00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:18.190
to Ledger's suicide, but that is, of course,
just a theory.Ledger's passing came just before

00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:22.500
the release of The Dark Knight in 2008, but
he received universal praise for his performance

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:26.340
and even earned a posthumous Academy Award
for Best Supporting Actor for it.

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:31.460
His iconic line "why so serious" will forever
live on in cinematic lore.

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:34.220
Jared Leto
Next in line to play The Joker on the big

00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:38.080
screen is Jared Leto - a man who will put
as much into the role as Ledger did back in

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:43.200
2008 (he's already terrified his fellow cast
members by remaining in character at all times

00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:47.240
on set - and he's famously sent them some
very strange gifts, including bullets and

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:52.500
dead animals).Leto has the responsibility
of taking on the role in the DC Extended Universe,

00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:56.811
starting with 2016's Suicide Squad and, potentially,
in several other movies going forward in the

00:05:56.811 --> 00:06:00.669
franchise .This version looks more different
to any that came before it than any other

00:06:00.669 --> 00:06:04.790
version, with his slicked back green hair,
silver teeth and body covered in tattoos.

00:06:04.790 --> 00:06:08.590
He looks as though he revels in the pain of
other more than other versions, and fans and

00:06:08.590 --> 00:06:12.290
critics are completely divided about him,
based on what they've seen of him in promotional

00:06:12.290 --> 00:06:16.300
material and trailers so far, with some claiming
it looks as though Leto and the people behind

00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:21.120
Suicide Squad are "trying too hard to be different".It
remains to be seen how he will be received

00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:25.170
once Suicide Squad is actually released, but
the likes of Jack Nicholson and Heath Ledger

00:06:25.170 --> 00:06:28.500
are undoubtedly tough acts to follow, and
Leto will need to have brought his A-game

00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:31.580
to his performance in order to garner favourable
reviews.

00:06:31.580 --> 00:06:35.250
All we can say is that we remain hopeful of
this drastically different version being as

00:06:35.250 --> 00:06:36.600
brilliant as his predecessors.

00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:40.160
