00:00:00.452 --> 00:00:01.234
- [Voiceover] Let's say that I've got

00:00:01.234 --> 00:00:02.701
two different data sets.

00:00:02.701 --> 00:00:05.804
The first data set, I have two,

00:00:05.804 --> 00:00:09.731
another two, a four, and a four.

00:00:09.731 --> 00:00:13.586
And then, in the other
data set, I have a one.

00:00:13.586 --> 00:00:15.741
We'll do this on the
right side of the screen.

00:00:15.741 --> 00:00:19.007
A one, a one, a six,

00:00:19.007 --> 00:00:21.175
and a four.

00:00:21.175 --> 00:00:22.877
Now, the first thing I
wanna think about is,

00:00:22.877 --> 00:00:23.733
"Well, how do I ...

00:00:23.733 --> 00:00:25.271
"Is there a number that can give me

00:00:27.348 --> 00:00:30.266
"a measure of center of
each of these data sets?"

00:00:30.266 --> 00:00:31.964
And one of the ways that
we know how to do that

00:00:31.964 --> 00:00:33.443
is by finding the mean.

00:00:33.443 --> 00:00:36.245
So let's figure out the mean
of each of these data sets.

00:00:36.245 --> 00:00:39.041
This first data set, the mean ...

00:00:39.041 --> 00:00:41.332
Well, we just need to sum
up all of the numbers.

00:00:41.332 --> 00:00:43.110
That's gonna be two plus two

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:45.167
plus four plus four.

00:00:45.167 --> 00:00:45.910
And then we're gonna divide

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:48.235
by the number of numbers that we have.

00:00:48.235 --> 00:00:50.866
So we have one, two, three, four numbers.

00:00:50.866 --> 00:00:52.578
That's that four right over there.

00:00:52.578 --> 00:00:55.443
And this is going to be,
two plus two is four,

00:00:55.443 --> 00:00:57.635
plus four is eight, plus four is 12.

00:00:57.635 --> 00:01:00.582
This is gonna be 12 over four,

00:01:02.474 --> 00:01:05.362
which is equal to three.

00:01:05.362 --> 00:01:07.478
Actually, let's see if
we can visualize this

00:01:07.478 --> 00:01:09.273
a little bit on a number line.

00:01:12.041 --> 00:01:13.411
Actually I'll do kind of a ...

00:01:13.411 --> 00:01:15.273
I'll do a little bit of a dot plot here

00:01:15.273 --> 00:01:17.203
so we can see all of the values.

00:01:18.346 --> 00:01:22.877
If this is zero, one, two,

00:01:22.877 --> 00:01:27.069
three, four, and five.

00:01:28.031 --> 00:01:29.436
We have two twos.

00:01:29.436 --> 00:01:30.677
Why don't I just do ...

00:01:30.677 --> 00:01:32.773
So for each of these twos ...

00:01:32.773 --> 00:01:34.371
Actually, I'll just do it in yellow.

00:01:34.371 --> 00:01:37.271
So I have one two, then
I have another two.

00:01:37.271 --> 00:01:38.610
I'm just gonna do a dot plot here.

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:40.208
Then I have two fours.

00:01:40.208 --> 00:01:44.304
So, one four and another
four, right over there.

00:01:44.304 --> 00:01:46.809
And we calculated that the mean is three.

00:01:46.809 --> 00:01:48.447
The mean is three.

00:01:48.447 --> 00:01:50.866
A measure of central
tendency, it is three.

00:01:50.866 --> 00:01:52.410
So I'll just put three right over here.

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:54.237
I'll just mark it with that dotted line.

00:01:54.237 --> 00:01:55.937
That's where the mean is.

00:01:55.937 --> 00:01:57.776
All right. Well, we've
visualized that a little bit.

00:01:57.776 --> 00:02:00.038
That does look like it's the center.

00:02:00.038 --> 00:02:01.870
It's a pretty ...

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:03.040
It makes sense.

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:05.557
So now let's look at this
other data set right over here.

00:02:06.603 --> 00:02:09.808
The mean, the mean over here

00:02:09.808 --> 00:02:12.542
is going to be equal to one plus one

00:02:12.542 --> 00:02:15.333
plus six plus four,

00:02:15.333 --> 00:02:17.908
all of that over, we still
have four data points.

00:02:17.908 --> 00:02:19.870
And this is two plus six is eight,

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:21.352
plus four is 12,

00:02:21.352 --> 00:02:22.400
12 divided by four ...

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:24.441
This is also three.

00:02:24.441 --> 00:02:26.279
So this also has the same mean.

00:02:26.279 --> 00:02:27.546
We have different numbers,

00:02:27.546 --> 00:02:30.433
but we have the same mean.

00:02:30.433 --> 00:02:32.044
But there's something about this data set

00:02:32.044 --> 00:02:33.906
that feels a little bit
different about this.

00:02:33.906 --> 00:02:35.266
And let's visualize it,

00:02:35.266 --> 00:02:36.970
to see if we can see a difference.

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:39.970
Let's see if we can visualize it.

00:02:41.975 --> 00:02:43.870
I have to go all the way up to six.

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:46.800
Let's say this is zero, one,

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:50.733
two, three, four,

00:02:50.733 --> 00:02:52.668
five, six,

00:02:52.668 --> 00:02:54.725
and I'll go one more, seven.

00:02:54.725 --> 00:02:56.410
So we have a one.

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:59.007
We have a one, we have another one.

00:03:00.345 --> 00:03:01.781
We have a six.

00:03:03.304 --> 00:03:04.868
And then we have a four.

00:03:05.546 --> 00:03:08.308
And we calculated that the mean is three.

00:03:08.308 --> 00:03:10.604
So we calculated that the mean is three.

00:03:10.604 --> 00:03:13.045
So the mean is three.

00:03:14.345 --> 00:03:15.797
When we measure it by the mean,

00:03:15.797 --> 00:03:18.840
the central point, or
measure of that central point

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:20.009
which we use as the mean,

00:03:20.009 --> 00:03:22.966
well, it looks the same, but
the data sets look different.

00:03:22.971 --> 00:03:24.207
How do they look different?

00:03:24.207 --> 00:03:25.727
Well, we've talked about notions

00:03:25.727 --> 00:03:27.734
of variability or variation.

00:03:27.734 --> 00:03:30.745
And it looks like this data
set is more spread out.

00:03:30.745 --> 00:03:33.239
It looks like the data
points are on average

00:03:33.239 --> 00:03:34.941
further away from the mean

00:03:34.941 --> 00:03:37.010
than these data points are.

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:38.371
That's an interesting question

00:03:38.371 --> 00:03:40.244
that we ask ourselves in statistics.

00:03:40.244 --> 00:03:43.841
We just don't want a measure
of center, like the mean.

00:03:43.841 --> 00:03:46.766
We might also want a
measure of variability.

00:03:46.766 --> 00:03:49.464
And one of the more straightforward ways

00:03:49.464 --> 00:03:51.038
to think about variability is,

00:03:51.038 --> 00:03:55.234
well, on average, how far
are each of the data points

00:03:55.234 --> 00:03:57.707
from the mean?

00:03:57.707 --> 00:03:58.977
That might sound a little complicated,

00:03:58.977 --> 00:04:00.533
but we're gonna figure out what that means

00:04:00.533 --> 00:04:03.865
in a second, (chortles) not
to overuse the word "mean."

00:04:03.865 --> 00:04:05.620
So we wanna figure out, on average,

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:08.635
how far each of these
data points from the mean.

00:04:08.635 --> 00:04:09.900
And what we're about to calculate,

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:14.205
this is called Mean Absolute Deviation.

00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:17.346
Absolute Deviation.

00:04:18.712 --> 00:04:20.206
Mean Absolute Deviation,

00:04:20.206 --> 00:04:22.700
or if you just use the acronym, MAD,

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:26.014
mad, for Mean Absolute Deviation.

00:04:26.014 --> 00:04:26.900
And all we're talking about,

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:29.267
we're gonna figure out how
much do each of these points,

00:04:29.267 --> 00:04:32.033
their distance, so absolute deviation.

00:04:32.033 --> 00:04:34.135
How much do the deviate from the mean,

00:04:34.135 --> 00:04:35.241
but the absolute of it?

00:04:35.241 --> 00:04:36.838
So each of these points at two,

00:04:36.838 --> 00:04:39.146
they are one away from the mean.

00:04:39.146 --> 00:04:40.513
Doesn't matter if they're less or more.

00:04:40.513 --> 00:04:42.122
They're one away from the mean.

00:04:42.122 --> 00:04:44.543
And then we find the mean
of all of the deviations.

00:04:44.543 --> 00:04:45.613
So what does that mean?

00:04:45.613 --> 00:04:47.642
(chuckles) I'm using the word "mean,"

00:04:47.642 --> 00:04:49.300
using it a little bit too much.

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:51.307
So let's figure out the
Mean Absolute Deviation

00:04:51.307 --> 00:04:53.610
of this first data set.

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:55.655
We've been able to figure
out what the mean is.

00:04:55.655 --> 00:04:57.366
The mean is three.

00:04:57.366 --> 00:04:59.271
So we take each of the data points

00:04:59.271 --> 00:05:00.536
and we figure out,

00:05:00.536 --> 00:05:03.624
what's its absolute
deviation from the mean?

00:05:03.624 --> 00:05:05.674
So we take the first two.

00:05:05.674 --> 00:05:08.867
So we say, two minus the mean.

00:05:08.867 --> 00:05:11.847
Two minus the mean, and we
take the absolute value.

00:05:11.847 --> 00:05:13.573
So that's its absolute deviation.

00:05:13.573 --> 00:05:15.311
Then we have another two,

00:05:15.311 --> 00:05:18.471
so we find that absolute
deviation from three.

00:05:18.471 --> 00:05:19.770
Remember, if we're just
taking two minus three,

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:21.234
taking the absolute value,

00:05:21.234 --> 00:05:22.711
that's just saying its absolute deviation.

00:05:22.711 --> 00:05:24.381
How far is it from three?

00:05:24.381 --> 00:05:27.376
It's fairly easy to
calculate in this case.

00:05:27.376 --> 00:05:30.237
Then we have a four and another four.

00:05:31.143 --> 00:05:32.076
Let me write that.

00:05:32.076 --> 00:05:34.217
Then we have

00:05:34.217 --> 00:05:38.172
the absolute deviation of four from three,

00:05:38.172 --> 00:05:39.800
from the mean.

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:41.669
Then plus, we have another four.

00:05:41.669 --> 00:05:43.976
We have this other four right up here.

00:05:43.976 --> 00:05:46.005
Four minus three.

00:05:46.005 --> 00:05:46.972
We take the absolute value,

00:05:46.972 --> 00:05:49.280
because once again,
it's absolute deviation.

00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:51.203
And then we divide it,

00:05:51.203 --> 00:05:53.833
and then we divide it by the
number of data points we have.

00:05:54.534 --> 00:05:55.937
So what is this going to be?

00:05:55.937 --> 00:05:57.912
Two minus three is negative one,

00:05:57.912 --> 00:05:59.279
but we take the absolute value.

00:05:59.279 --> 00:06:00.909
It's just going to be one.

00:06:00.909 --> 00:06:02.500
Two minus three is negative one.

00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:03.577
We take the absolute value.

00:06:03.577 --> 00:06:04.876
It's just gonna be one.

00:06:04.876 --> 00:06:05.934
And you see that here visually.

00:06:05.934 --> 00:06:08.309
This point is just one away.

00:06:08.309 --> 00:06:09.807
It's just one away from three.

00:06:09.807 --> 00:06:12.278
This point is just one away from three.

00:06:12.278 --> 00:06:13.798
Four minus three is one.

00:06:13.798 --> 00:06:15.444
Absolute value of that is one.

00:06:15.444 --> 00:06:18.187
This point is just one away from three.

00:06:18.187 --> 00:06:19.572
Four minus three, absolute value.

00:06:19.572 --> 00:06:21.006
That's another one.

00:06:21.006 --> 00:06:21.902
So you see in this case,

00:06:21.902 --> 00:06:25.140
every data point was exactly one away

00:06:25.140 --> 00:06:26.842
from the mean.

00:06:26.842 --> 00:06:27.671
And we took the absolute value

00:06:27.671 --> 00:06:29.072
so that we don't have negative ones here.

00:06:29.072 --> 00:06:33.116
We just care how far it
is in absolute terms.

00:06:33.116 --> 00:06:34.736
So you have four data points.

00:06:34.736 --> 00:06:37.579
Each of their absolute
deviations is four away.

00:06:37.579 --> 00:06:39.486
So the mean of the absolute deviations

00:06:39.486 --> 00:06:41.207
are one plus one plus one plus one,

00:06:41.207 --> 00:06:43.544
which is four, over four.

00:06:43.544 --> 00:06:45.073
So it's equal to one.

00:06:45.073 --> 00:06:46.667
One way to think about it is saying,

00:06:46.667 --> 00:06:50.137
on average, the mean of the
distances of these points

00:06:50.137 --> 00:06:53.283
away from the actual mean is one.

00:06:53.283 --> 00:06:54.797
And that makes sense because all of these

00:06:54.797 --> 00:06:58.337
are exactly one away from the mean.

00:06:58.337 --> 00:06:59.485
Now, let's see how,

00:06:59.485 --> 00:07:02.681
what results we get for this
data set right over here.

00:07:02.681 --> 00:07:03.835
And I'll do it ...

00:07:03.835 --> 00:07:05.854
Let me actually get some space over here.

00:07:05.854 --> 00:07:07.110
At any point, if you get inspired,

00:07:07.110 --> 00:07:08.175
I encourage you to calculate

00:07:08.175 --> 00:07:10.611
the Mean Absolute Deviation on your own.

00:07:10.611 --> 00:07:12.311
So let's calculate it.

00:07:12.311 --> 00:07:14.837
The Mean Absolute Deviation here,

00:07:14.837 --> 00:07:16.322
I'll write MAD,

00:07:16.322 --> 00:07:17.508
is going to be equal to ...

00:07:17.508 --> 00:07:18.989
Well, let's figure out
the absolute deviation

00:07:18.989 --> 00:07:21.530
of each of these points from the mean.

00:07:21.530 --> 00:07:23.807
It's the absolute value
of one minus three,

00:07:23.807 --> 00:07:25.380
that's this first one,

00:07:25.380 --> 00:07:27.341
plus the absolute deviation,

00:07:27.341 --> 00:07:29.977
so one minus three, that's the second one,

00:07:29.977 --> 00:07:32.416
then plus the absolute
value of six minus three,

00:07:32.416 --> 00:07:33.535
that's the six,

00:07:33.535 --> 00:07:34.378
then we have the four,

00:07:34.378 --> 00:07:36.733
plus the absolute value
of four minus three.

00:07:36.733 --> 00:07:39.585
Then we have four points.

00:07:39.585 --> 00:07:41.259
So one minus three is negative two.

00:07:41.259 --> 00:07:43.006
Absolute value is two.

00:07:43.006 --> 00:07:44.176
And we see that here.

00:07:44.176 --> 00:07:46.578
This is two away from three.

00:07:46.578 --> 00:07:48.376
We just care about absolute deviation.

00:07:48.376 --> 00:07:50.744
We don't care if it's to
the left or to the right.

00:07:50.744 --> 00:07:52.980
Then we have another one
minus three is negative two.

00:07:52.980 --> 00:07:55.111
It's absolute value, so this is two.

00:07:55.111 --> 00:07:58.283
That's this. This is
two away from the mean.

00:07:58.283 --> 00:07:59.731
Then we have six minus three.

00:07:59.731 --> 00:08:01.933
Absolute value of that
is going to be three.

00:08:01.933 --> 00:08:03.803
And that's this right over here.

00:08:03.803 --> 00:08:06.407
We see this six is three

00:08:06.407 --> 00:08:07.477
to the right of the mean.

00:08:07.477 --> 00:08:09.340
We don't care whether it's
to the right or the left.

00:08:09.340 --> 00:08:11.624
And then four minus three.

00:08:11.624 --> 00:08:14.711
Four minus three is one,
absolute value is one.

00:08:14.711 --> 00:08:15.398
And we see that.

00:08:15.398 --> 00:08:18.239
It is one to the right of three.

00:08:18.239 --> 00:08:19.271
And so what do we have?

00:08:19.271 --> 00:08:21.544
We have two plus two is four,

00:08:21.544 --> 00:08:24.218
plus three is seven, plus one is eight,

00:08:24.218 --> 00:08:27.534
over four, which is equal to two.

00:08:27.534 --> 00:08:30.157
So the Mean Absolute Deviation ...

00:08:30.157 --> 00:08:30.967
Let me write it down.

00:08:30.967 --> 00:08:32.341
It fell off over here.

00:08:32.341 --> 00:08:33.900
Here, for this data set,

00:08:33.900 --> 00:08:36.933
the Mean Absolute
Deviation is equal to two,

00:08:36.933 --> 00:08:38.439
while for this data set,

00:08:38.439 --> 00:08:41.173
the Mean Absolute
Deviation is equal to one.

00:08:41.173 --> 00:08:42.144
And that makes sense.

00:08:42.144 --> 00:08:43.937
They have the exact same means.

00:08:43.937 --> 00:08:45.445
They both have a mean of three.

00:08:45.445 --> 00:08:47.004
But this one is more spread out.

00:08:47.004 --> 00:08:48.581
The one on the right is more spread out

00:08:48.581 --> 00:08:51.201
because, on average, each of these points

00:08:51.201 --> 00:08:53.309
are two away from three,

00:08:53.309 --> 00:08:55.274
while on average, each of these points

00:08:55.274 --> 00:08:57.707
are one away from three.

00:08:57.707 --> 00:09:01.077
The means of the absolute
deviations on this one is one.

00:09:01.077 --> 00:09:04.245
The means of the absolute
deviations on this one is two.

00:09:04.245 --> 00:09:07.741
So the green one is more
spread out from the mean.
