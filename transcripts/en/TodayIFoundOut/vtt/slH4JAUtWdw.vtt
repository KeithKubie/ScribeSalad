00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:12.340
History is filled with stories of eccentric
people whose lives were littered with astonishing

00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:14.500
and sometimes improbable stories.

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:18.940
Edward Hughes Ball Hughes (that was his real
name) was one such individual- a man who spent

00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:23.810
money so erratically that he came to be known
by the rather fitting moniker of Golden Ball

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:27.070
Hughes or more simple, The Golden Ball.

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:32.840
Born in 1798 to a relatively well off family,
Edward Hughes Ball enjoyed the finest education

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:37.030
money could provide, studying at both Eton
and Trinity College in Cambridge.

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:40.970
He also enjoyed a brief stint in the army
shortly after leaving college, serving with

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:46.530
the 7th Queen’s Own Hussars right up until
1819 when he heard the news that a distant

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:49.120
uncle on his mother’s side had sadly passed
away.

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:54.170
As it turns out, this uncle had left the young
man his entire estate, comprising of two homes

00:00:54.170 --> 00:01:01.489
in London, an estate in Essex, and approximately
£600,000, or roughly £50 million today ($66

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:02.489
million).

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:06.789
The finances from this inheritance were put
into a trust to be doled out to Edward to

00:01:06.789 --> 00:01:12.040
the tune of around £40,000 per year (the
modern equivalent of about three or four million

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:13.040
pounds).

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:17.110
Around this time, Edward legally changed his
name from Edward Ball Hughes to Edward Hughes

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:21.720
Ball Hughes as a nod to the uncle who’d
left him his hard earned fortune, one Admiral

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:22.900
Sir Edward Hughes.

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:27.380
Soon after inheriting the money his uncle
had painstakingly accumulated over his lifetime,

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:32.270
Edward Hughes Ball Hughes set about transforming
himself into the epitome of an English dandy

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:36.420
by spending his inheritance as fast and as
frivolously as he could.

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:40.530
Known for being extraordinarily handsome,
with an enormous fortune now at his disposal,

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:45.270
Hughes easily assimilated himself into the
upper classes of society, peacocking his way

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:50.119
onto the radar of the rich and powerful of
the nation at every opportunity possible.

00:01:50.119 --> 00:01:53.810
Found at virtually any party of note near
London, Hughes, dressed to the nines, would

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:58.950
roll up to balls and galas in a custom made
chocolate coloured coach pulled by matching

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:02.340
horses, invariably with a beautiful young
woman on each arm.

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:07.079
Hughes’ flamboyant dress sense and overwhelmingly
affable personality saw him become popular

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:11.680
with the self-styled aristocratic dandies
of the day, with his peers affectionately

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:16.900
referring to him as “Golden Ball Hughes”
in reference to his fabulous wealth.

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:21.469
Despite his popularity, many preyed on Hughes’
seemingly obliviousness to the value of money

00:02:21.469 --> 00:02:25.359
and his love of gambling to fleece the young
fop at every turn.

00:02:25.359 --> 00:02:29.249
He was even known to be willing to bet many
thousands of pounds on things as innocent

00:02:29.249 --> 00:02:31.189
as a single flip of a coin.

00:02:31.189 --> 00:02:36.200
Hughes was such a naive gambler, and so well
liked, that in 1824 someone took it upon him

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:40.829
or herself to warn the hapless rake about
ne’er do wells who were trying to take his

00:02:40.829 --> 00:02:45.159
money, going as far as printing a pamphlet
and sending it to him, which stated, among

00:02:45.159 --> 00:02:46.159
other things:

00:02:46.159 --> 00:02:50.150
Another observation I must make – you were
chosen a member of White’s Club-house on

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:51.209
the day of your marriage.

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:56.689
Listen, Sir, a WARNING VOICE; there are THREE
members of THAT Club who have ALREADY marked

00:02:56.689 --> 00:03:02.280
you as a victim to combinations you cannot
detect, and to skill you are unable to oppose.

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:04.959
Ruin will follow your steps THERE; you cannot
escape.

00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:10.420
If you play in private, or at subscription
houses you devote yourself to inevitable destruction,

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:12.309
and your whole family to beggary.

00:03:12.309 --> 00:03:16.930
In these slaughter houses, carcass butchers
of rank and title will knock down your whole

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:18.400
fortune in one night…

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:23.059
The day after the pamphlet arrived, Hughes
went to that same gambling club and, indeed,

00:03:23.059 --> 00:03:27.799
lost a relatively large percentage of his
fortune in one night, a sum of close to £45,000

00:03:27.799 --> 00:03:30.489
(about £4 million today).

00:03:30.489 --> 00:03:35.260
Thanks to his massive and frequent losses,
Hughes’ was, at least according to one contemporary’s

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:39.150
seemingly ironic account, “perhaps the greatest
gambler of his day”.

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:43.870
Maria-MercandottiShortly before this gambling
debacle, in 1823, the 25 year old Hughes became

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:49.120
infatuated with a 16 year old Spanish dancer
called Maria Mercandotti.

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:51.290
According to a contemporary article in The
London Gazette,

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:55.340
Mercandotti, who had been gaining ground till
she was at the height of public favour, on

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:59.450
the first night of this ballet (the 8th of
March) took the part of the king’s page

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:02.859
in this performance, and looked and danced
it admirably.

00:04:02.859 --> 00:04:07.650
Among the number of hearts on whom the bewitching
eyes of the fair Spaniard had made an impression,

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:12.310
was that of a gentleman well known as a man
of wealth and fashion, Mr. Hughes Ball.

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:16.669
This worshiper, like many others, had long
and assiduously devoted his attentions to

00:04:16.669 --> 00:04:21.199
Mercandotti; but she was one of those rare
examples that now and then occur to ornament

00:04:21.199 --> 00:04:25.419
the female biography of the stage, who, in
a situation of all others the most trying

00:04:25.419 --> 00:04:30.380
to the best virtues of woman, preserve unsullied
the integrity of their reputation.

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:34.720
Nevertheless, a few months later, with a packed
house set to see the young starlet perform,

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:38.480
she mysteriously didn’t show up, forcing
the manager to tell the audience the show

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:41.690
was canceled, ostensibly because Mercandotti
was sick.

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:45.479
However, in The London Gazette report, it
was later noted, “that Mercandotti had a

00:04:45.479 --> 00:04:50.060
more agreeable cause of absence than ill health,
and that she accepted the hand offered to

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:51.789
her, at length, by Mr. Ball.”

00:04:51.789 --> 00:04:56.210
When this fact emerged, noted English author
William Harrison Ainsworth reportedly quipped:

00:04:56.210 --> 00:05:01.200
“The damsel is gone, and no wonder at all
that, bred to the dance, she has gone to the

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:02.200
Ball.”

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:08.370
Less than a year after marrying Mercandotti,
Hughes purchased a 3,233 acre property known

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:12.800
as the Oatlands Estate from the Duke of York
where he and his new wife enjoyed the finer

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:15.340
things in life like hunting and banqueting.

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:19.680
Now, you probably think that we mean that
the pair did those activities separately,

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:22.430
but this is the Golden Ball we’re talking
about.

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:27.509
Hughes found a way to combine the two endeavours,
hiring a veritable army of servants to follow

00:05:27.509 --> 00:05:32.960
him on his hunts carrying food, wine, spare
guns and an entire wardrobe so he could change

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:36.259
and hold a feast whenever he got bored with
the hunt.

00:05:36.259 --> 00:05:40.650
Legal difficulties meant that Hughes didn’t
technically own Oatlands for three years after

00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:44.450
he’d moved in because of an issue of the
ownership of a portion of the property from

00:05:44.450 --> 00:05:46.979
a previous sale in the late 18th century.

00:05:46.979 --> 00:05:51.699
In 1827, Hughes eventually got so annoyed
that he demanded his lawyers simply ignore

00:05:51.699 --> 00:05:56.430
any objections to the sale using the age-old
tactic of throwing money at his problem until

00:05:56.430 --> 00:05:57.500
it went away.

00:05:57.500 --> 00:06:01.050
By this point, the Duke of York had died and
the sale was able to be completed without

00:06:01.050 --> 00:06:07.120
much more delay, to the tune of about £145,000
(about £14,000,000 today).

00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:11.270
A year after the sale was completed, the Golden
Ball ran out of gold and the property once

00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:12.580
again went up for sale.

00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:16.610
At the same time, Hughes fled the country
in the wake of the revelation that he’d

00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:19.860
inadvertently gambled away nearly his entire
fortune.

00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:24.840
In one of the only sound financial moves of
his life, Hughes wisely left control of his

00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:29.780
affairs to the infinitely more capable hands
of his solicitors, Frere and Forster, who

00:06:29.780 --> 00:06:33.850
also took over management of the Oatlands
Estate, even managing to turn a profit from

00:06:33.850 --> 00:06:34.850
it.

00:06:34.850 --> 00:06:38.191
Nevertheless, Hughes’ debts were such that,
despite the estate now being profitable, they

00:06:38.191 --> 00:06:42.819
were forced to divide it up and sell it off
piece by piece to hold his creditors at bay.

00:06:42.819 --> 00:06:46.979
At the same time they were securing Hughes’
financial future, his solicitors pleaded with

00:06:46.979 --> 00:06:51.259
him to live within his means, agreeing to
send him an allowance equivalent in modern

00:06:51.259 --> 00:06:53.879
times to several thousand pounds per week.

00:06:53.879 --> 00:06:59.080
This paltry amount apparently wasn’t sufficient
and Hughes racked up even more debt by gambling

00:06:59.080 --> 00:07:03.330
and spending exorbitant amounts on food, wine,
and clothing while in France.

00:07:03.330 --> 00:07:06.530
To be fair, he was technically on vacation…

00:07:06.530 --> 00:07:10.919
No doubt seeing the writing on the wall, or
perhaps not happy with the change in lifestyle

00:07:10.919 --> 00:07:17.469
Hughes’ diminishing funds afforded, Mercandotti
divorced him in 1839 in search of better prospects.

00:07:17.469 --> 00:07:21.430
Even after his financial situation was once
again secured thanks to the work of Frere

00:07:21.430 --> 00:07:26.090
and Forster, Hughes never returned to England,
though seemingly did learn his lesson, living

00:07:26.090 --> 00:07:30.070
a “quiet” life, by his standards at least,
in Paris where he had three children with

00:07:30.070 --> 00:07:35.120
one Eliza Breugnot Momborne and later two
children with Anne Henriette de Dauvet in

00:07:35.120 --> 00:07:36.169
the 1850s.

00:07:36.169 --> 00:07:42.490
Hughes died in 1863 at the age of 65, leaving
behind an estate worth a little over £30,000

00:07:42.490 --> 00:07:44.380
or about £3 million today.

00:07:44.380 --> 00:07:48.020
While this isn’t exactly a figure to be
sniffed at, it’s almost nothing compared

00:07:48.020 --> 00:07:53.930
to the enormous sum he once had as his inheritance,
an estate that even with mediocre management

00:07:53.930 --> 00:08:11.710
should have seen him living lavishly, but
still managing to increase his net worth.
