Technology might make
magic harder,

00:00:03.102 --> 00:00:04.971
but, man, living in a state
with legal marijuana

00:00:05.004 --> 00:00:07.874
makes it much easier.

00:00:07.907 --> 00:00:10.710
To prove my point,
I went to a local pot dispensary

00:00:10.743 --> 00:00:12.812
with my buddy Doug Benson.

00:00:12.845 --> 00:00:14.080
Check it out.

00:00:14.113 --> 00:00:17.016 align:start position:0%
We're here with Doug Benson,
aka High-dini.

00:00:17.049 --> 00:00:20.019 align:start size:13% position:88%
Ooh!

00:00:20.052 --> 00:00:21.054
Inhale this.

00:00:21.087 --> 00:00:22.388
Magic.

00:00:22.421 --> 00:00:23.890
[upbeat music]

00:00:23.923 --> 00:00:26.392
(Justin)
Technology has changed
the way people get high.

00:00:26.425 --> 00:00:29.362 align:start position:0%
Now, Doug, when was
the last time you smoked weed?

00:00:31.897 --> 00:00:33.132 align:start size:63% position:38%
Like, including now?

00:00:33.165 --> 00:00:34.233 align:start position:0%
[laughs]
Yeah.

00:00:34.266 --> 00:00:35.234 align:start size:13% position:88%
Now.

00:00:35.267 --> 00:00:36.369 align:start position:0%
This is a cloud vape.

00:00:36.402 --> 00:00:37.770 align:start position:0%
It vaporizes it.
What makes this unique?

00:00:37.803 --> 00:00:40.506 align:end position:100%
Well, that one there, um,
gets you really high.

00:00:40.539 --> 00:00:42.175 align:start position:0%
This is
another smaller vape.

00:00:42.208 --> 00:00:44.310 align:start position:0%
It actually plugs into a USB
to charge.

00:00:44.343 --> 00:00:45.711 align:end position:100%
You know what else it does?
It gets you really high.

00:00:45.744 --> 00:00:47.980 align:start position:0%
And I imagine, really, what sets
this one apart is, uh...

00:00:48.013 --> 00:00:48.981
- Oh, that right there?
- Mm-hmm.

00:00:49.014 --> 00:00:50.716
There's one thing.

00:00:50.749 --> 00:00:52.452
[both chuckle]
- Yeah?

00:00:52.485 --> 00:00:53.619
Get you really high.

00:00:53.652 --> 00:00:54.720 align:start position:0%
Get you really high.

00:00:54.753 --> 00:00:56.355 size:81% position:41%
Man, technology's amazing.

00:00:56.388 --> 00:00:58.357
(all)
Oh!

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:00.827
(Justin)
Truth be told, I know there's
no better audience for magic

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:02.061
than high people.

00:01:02.094 --> 00:01:03.997
[laughs]

00:01:06.332 --> 00:01:07.767
(man)
Whoo!

00:01:09.835 --> 00:01:11.104
Whoa.

00:01:11.137 --> 00:01:15.007
[laughter]

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:17.009
[mutters]

00:01:17.042 --> 00:01:19.312 align:end position:100%
One, two.
Right or left?

00:01:19.345 --> 00:01:20.313 align:start position:0%
That's too easy.

00:01:20.346 --> 00:01:23.216 align:start size:72% position:28%
Okay, that is too easy.

00:01:23.249 --> 00:01:24.383
[laughter]

00:01:24.416 --> 00:01:27.020 align:start position:0%
Um...
I don't know.

00:01:29.321 --> 00:01:31.391
[laughter]

00:01:33.325 --> 00:01:34.393 align:start size:44% position:56%
Right or left?

00:01:34.426 --> 00:01:35.595 align:start position:0%
It's not in either one.

00:01:35.628 --> 00:01:37.063 align:end position:100%
No, it's here!
Come on, watch.

00:01:37.096 --> 00:01:39.465 align:start size:59% position:41%
I didn't do it yet.
I didn't do it yet.

00:01:39.498 --> 00:01:41.334 align:start position:0%
Left.

00:01:41.367 --> 00:01:43.569 align:start position:0%
Oh, still--no.

00:01:43.602 --> 00:01:44.637 align:start position:0%
Wait a minute.

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:47.406
- [laughs]
- Where the hell--

00:01:47.439 --> 00:01:49.308
Damn it.
How did you--

00:01:49.341 --> 00:01:51.777
(Justin)
Imagine a deck of cards.

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:52.979 align:start position:0%
Pluck one out
as your favorite card.

00:01:53.012 --> 00:01:54.147 size:81% position:41%
What's your favorite card?

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:55.648
I don't have one.
7 of clubs.

00:01:55.681 --> 00:01:56.782 align:start position:0%
7 of clubs?
You want that one?

00:01:56.815 --> 00:01:59.152 align:start position:0%
Imagine the 7 of clubs
just kind of--

00:01:59.185 --> 00:02:00.786 align:start position:0%
just kind of emerging
from your brain

00:02:00.819 --> 00:02:03.256 align:start position:0%
as a thought into reality,
okay?

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:04.257 align:start position:0%
[exhales]
Just watch.

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:06.058 align:start position:0%
Imagine, just--

00:02:06.091 --> 00:02:07.493 size:75% position:38%
Keep your eyes open now.

00:02:07.526 --> 00:02:11.030 align:start position:0%
Keep your eyes open.
Here we go.

00:02:11.063 --> 00:02:12.798
Oh, my God.

00:02:12.831 --> 00:02:14.333
- Oh, my God!
- Right?

00:02:14.366 --> 00:02:16.269
- How's that possible?
- Isn't that amazing?

00:02:16.302 --> 00:02:18.237
- Isn't that weird?
- How'd he do that?

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:19.505 align:start position:0%
When you said
7 of clubs, like,

00:02:19.538 --> 00:02:20.973 align:start position:0%
you were thinking
of another card first, like--

00:02:21.006 --> 00:02:22.441 align:start position:0%
What was the card you originally
were going for in your mind?

00:02:22.474 --> 00:02:23.910
- I mean, how could you--
- What was the other card?

00:02:23.943 --> 00:02:24.977 align:start position:0%
There was another card
you were thinking.

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:26.212
- Okay, okay.
- What was it?

00:02:26.245 --> 00:02:27.380
- It was also a 7, maybe.
- 7 of what?

00:02:27.413 --> 00:02:28.381
Maybe it was, like,
a 7 of diamonds.

00:02:28.414 --> 00:02:29.382
Oh, no, I don't want to--

00:02:29.415 --> 00:02:30.650 align:start position:0%
No, no, no,
watch, watch, watch.

00:02:30.683 --> 00:02:31.717
Oh, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no.

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:32.718
- [exhales]
- Okay.

00:02:32.751 --> 00:02:34.053 align:start position:0%
It goes right back
where it came.

00:02:34.086 --> 00:02:35.154
- All right. Okay.
- Here, it's right here.

00:02:35.187 --> 00:02:36.289
- Right here, right there.
- Okay.

00:02:36.322 --> 00:02:37.490 align:start position:0%
Imagine the thought.
Imagine the thought.

00:02:37.523 --> 00:02:39.692
- And go.
- Ahh!

00:02:39.725 --> 00:02:41.194
- Boom.
- [screams]

00:02:41.227 --> 00:02:43.829 align:end position:100%
What the hell?
How'd he move--

00:02:43.862 --> 00:02:45.264 align:end position:100%
That's--
I mean, that can't--

00:02:45.297 --> 00:02:46.499
- I'm the devil, Doug.
- You're the devil.

00:02:46.532 --> 00:02:48.034
- The devil!
- Oh, my God.

00:02:48.067 --> 00:02:51.170
All of us saw that!
All of us saw that!

00:02:51.203 --> 00:02:52.471
(woman)
I don't know what's going on.

00:02:52.504 --> 00:02:53.806
[laughter]

00:02:53.839 --> 00:02:56.108 align:start position:0%
Well, Doug, thank you.

00:02:56.141 --> 00:02:57.476 align:start size:47% position:53%
Yes, thank you.

00:02:57.509 --> 00:02:58.578 size:78% position:39%
I've learned a lot today.

00:02:58.611 --> 00:03:00.046 align:start size:69% position:31%
Aw, I'm so high today.

00:03:00.079 --> 00:03:01.380 align:start position:0%
I don't know
if I'll remember any of it.

00:03:01.413 --> 00:03:02.848
[laughs]

00:03:02.881 --> 00:03:05.017
- That's the great things.
- It was great seeing--

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:06.752 align:end position:100% line:0%
We'll have to watch this segment
over and over again

00:03:06.785 --> 00:03:10.356 size:88% position:56% line:0%
from the right state of mind
like our friend Carla here.

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:13.125 align:start position:0% line:0%
[laughs]

00:03:13.158 --> 00:03:14.761 size:84% position:58% line:0%
She's happy to be in there.
