00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:03.699
A bra gun holster?

00:00:03.699 --> 00:00:07.040
An electromagnet plus balls equals

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:10.349
woooo!
Vsauce, Kevin here.

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:14.139
This is Mind Blow.
Touch screens are okay,

00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:19.300
but how about touching a force field?
Using infrared sensors this multi touch system

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:23.670
allows a traditional monitor to be
manipulated by hand. It can also be

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:25.070
suspended in air

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:29.630
to control a screen from afar.
Bosses can spy on their workers from afar

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:33.640
with this telepresence balloon.
This floating blimp shows a projection of

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:34.880
a person's face.

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:39.440
It's controlled remotely and broadcasts
audio through a built-in speaker.

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:42.940
If that wasn't weird enough, just hug a robot.

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:47.690
Telenoid is another telepresence device,
except it has facial expressions

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:52.219
transmitted from the user through webcam
and facial recognition software.

00:00:52.219 --> 00:00:54.899
And don't worry, there's a handheld version.

00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:01.620
Bipedal robots are usually heavy and unstable, but Kermit here can hop.

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:05.030
And that giant arm isn't being used to
aid in the jumping,

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:09.250
even though it looks like.
Humans can hop higher with the Bogo

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:12.850
Pogo, a redesigned pogo stick featuring a 'boassist,'

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:18.380
an aircraft grade aluminum.
Using audio-video illusion the McGurk effect

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:22.080
is a perceptual phenomena which
causes your vision to overmatch your

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:22.560
hearing.

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.900
The man says "bah," but your eyes see "fah,"

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:28.280
so you end up hearing "fah."

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:48.200
Now it's time for a giant cross
post slingshot.

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:51.750
This thing shoots 6 steel balls simultaneously to

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:57.490
to trash watermelon and wood boards.
To learn how to MacGyver things for

00:01:57.490 --> 00:01:58.130
yourself

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:03.300
check out Mac recipes, a website
dedicated to every MacGyver-ism. And still

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:04.869
not sure how we turned that coffin

00:02:04.869 --> 00:02:10.649
into a jet ski. I'm also not sure how this
helps you play basketball,

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:13.860
but apparently a French team seems to
think that it works.

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:16.970
Converse made a huge mirror out of Chuck Taylor's

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:21.190
that works by mapping the user's
movements and spinning the sneakers.

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:24.320
Breakfast is said to be the most
important meal of the day.

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:27.910
So, here it is floating in slow motion.

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:32.020
But you might prefer eating ten pounds

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:33.010
of gummy bears

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:36.530
that reenact your favorite classic video
games, like Breakout

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:40.710
and Pac-Man.
Finally, here's a real

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:43.610
epic animatronics from John Nolan.

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:56.980
I'm gonna leave you with the riddle.

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:06.290
There was green house.
Inside the green house

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:09.390
there was a white house.
Inside the white house

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:12.630
there was a red house.
Inside the red house

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:15.850
there were a lot of babies.
What is it?

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:20.430
And now for the genius of the week.
There are four video game references

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:25.330
in this video and there's one at
Facebook.com/vsaucegaming.

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:27.920
Find all five video game references

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:31.880
and leave your answer in the comments
below. The first person to do so

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:32.680
correctly

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:35.360
will be our genius of the week.
Good luck.

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:36.320
And as always,

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:37.560
thanks for watching.
