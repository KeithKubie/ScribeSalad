00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:03.540
All right, Charles welcome back, so let's let's see what you've come up with.

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:08.265
&gt;&gt; Okay, so I would choose for the second one support vector

00:00:08.265 --> 00:00:12.780
machines, and the reason why is because there seems to be a single

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:16.230
line that seems to be in the middle between where the plus and

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:19.360
the minus are, so it looks like it's trying to maximize the margin.

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:21.920
&gt;&gt; Yeah, though, those aren't training points. I'm just labeling the regions.

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:25.630
&gt;&gt; Oh never mind. Well then I totally misunderstood. [LAUGH] to do.

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:27.375
I stand by it.

00:00:27.375 --> 00:00:29.250
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I think it, I think that's a perfectly

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:32.159
fine answer because the sup, support basic vector machine is going

00:00:32.159 --> 00:00:34.920
to find a linear separator. And so the output, the

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:37.570
classifier that comes out of it is going to separate any kind

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:40.690
of region into pluses and minuses, with some lines separating

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:44.120
them out. That's also true of perceptrons, it's also true of

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:48.940
certain kinds of you know, simple neural nets. So all those

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:50.680
seem like they would be reasonable answers for the middle one.

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:52.010
&gt;&gt; Oh okay well, then given

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:57.480
that, I'm going to say the third one is a nearest neighbors method.

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:00.330
&gt;&gt; good. And like what nearest neighbor do you think?

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:04.093
&gt;&gt; K nearest neighbor? [LAUGH]

00:01:04.093 --> 00:01:06.200
&gt;&gt; Sure, I was thinking one nearest neighbor.

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:07.950
&gt;&gt; Yeah I was too actually, believe it or not.

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:11.610
&gt;&gt; One nearest neighbor. So we, I don't think we got a chance to draw

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:13.070
one of these diagrams when we were talking

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:17.130
about nearest neighbors. But this is called a,

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:18.210
&gt;&gt; Voronoi diagram?

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.140
&gt;&gt; Voronoi diagram! Right! Because what,

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:21.770
what's happening is, it's breaking up

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:24.950
the plane into the regions that are closest to some particular points.

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:25.040
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:26.220
&gt;&gt; So you give it a set of points,

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:27.730
it breaks up the plane into the things closest

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:30.380
to that. And in this particular case our We

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:33.200
had, we probably had three points. And one was labeled

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:35.190
plus, and another was labeled plus. One was labeled

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:37.010
minus, and so it break the space up into

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:39.580
these sections that way. So this, this should. Voronoi

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:42.140
diagrams can be very aesthetically pleasing I don't think I

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:43.390
drew this one particularly well.

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:45.510
&gt;&gt; I think it's perfect. My eyes are closed. I think it's

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:49.249
perfect. Given that, that I'm going to say the first one is decision trees.

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:53.810
&gt;&gt; Very good. Because decision trees split

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:55.810
things you know, if you're talking about

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:59.410
in, in a, in a two dimensional space it's going to split at the

00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:04.310
top node in one dimension. And here it looks like that's this split. Then

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:07.170
maybe, looks like on the left side that's a minus. On the right side

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:09.538
there's another split. On the left side of that

00:02:09.538 --> 00:02:11.260
it's a plus. On the right side there's another

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:13.900
split into pluses and minuses. You get these sort

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:16.950
of interesting nested rectangles. They also can be very pretty.

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:17.330
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:19.920
&gt;&gt; Very Mondrianish. Yeah, very good. So this

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:21.220
is not what we're going to talk about today.

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:22.160
&gt;&gt; Okay, good.
