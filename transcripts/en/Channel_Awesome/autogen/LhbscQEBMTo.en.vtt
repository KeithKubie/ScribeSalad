they were probably little tipsy one they
 

00:09:54.400 --> 00:09:55.740
they were probably little tipsy one they
did this and that's how he kind of

00:09:55.740 --> 00:09:55.750
did this and that's how he kind of
 

00:09:55.750 --> 00:09:58.079
did this and that's how he kind of
convinced Frey to go into it so he made

00:09:58.079 --> 00:09:58.089
convinced Frey to go into it so he made
 

00:09:58.089 --> 00:10:01.530

up the idea that that's the magic drink

00:10:01.530 --> 00:10:01.540
up the idea that that's the magic drink
 

00:10:01.540 --> 00:10:03.110
up the idea that that's the magic drink
that turns them into ghostbusters and

00:10:03.110 --> 00:10:03.120
that turns them into ghostbusters and
 

00:10:03.120 --> 00:10:05.280
that turns them into ghostbusters and
the only reason I bring this up is

00:10:05.280 --> 00:10:05.290
the only reason I bring this up is
 

00:10:05.290 --> 00:10:07.980
the only reason I bring this up is
because if you watch that scene watch it

00:10:07.980 --> 00:10:07.990
because if you watch that scene watch it
 

00:10:07.990 --> 00:10:09.900
because if you watch that scene watch it
with the idea that that is the magic

00:10:09.900 --> 00:10:09.910
with the idea that that is the magic
 

00:10:09.910 --> 00:10:11.310
with the idea that that is the magic
drink that turns him into ghostbusters

00:10:11.310 --> 00:10:11.320
drink that turns him into ghostbusters
 

00:10:11.320 --> 00:10:13.470
drink that turns him into ghostbusters
because once ray drinks it he starts
