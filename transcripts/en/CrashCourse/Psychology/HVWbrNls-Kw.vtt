00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:02.310
It was midnight when Bernice got off work.

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:06.479
She was exhausted after a long and terrible
day, and just wanted to get home to a hot

00:00:06.479 --> 00:00:07.479
bath.

00:00:07.479 --> 00:00:10.370
She was driving down the street, flipping
through radio stations, when she pulled up

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:12.280
to a stop sign, and saw something weird.

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:16.970
A shadowy figure ran up to an idling fruit
truck, pushed the delivery man down, grabbed

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:19.580
a crate of bananas, and ran off around the
corner.

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:22.750
Bernice was pretty shaken up, but she made
sure the driver was okay, and then called

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:27.720
the police, describing the thief as a pale,
lanky man, wearing a dark jacket and a baseball

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:28.720
cap.

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:30.500
She gave the cops her information, and then
she went home.

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:34.910
A couple days later the police asked her to
come down to the station to identify a potential

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:39.449
thief--a guy who more or less matched her
description, and was found eating a banana

00:00:39.449 --> 00:00:42.040
early that morning, near the scene of the
crime.

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:46.000
Although the guy professed innocence, Bernice
said it was him, and they locked him up.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.929
But at the trial, the defense called a memory
expert to the stand, and soon after that,

00:00:49.929 --> 00:00:51.079
the suspect walked.

00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:54.270
Today’s lesson may not quite make you an
expert worthy of the witness stand, but by

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:58.079
the time we’re done, you’ll understand
a lot more about how we retrieve memories

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:05.420
we think we’ve stored, and why the accused
banana thief was set free.

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:08.900
[INTRO]

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:15.650
We’re all constantly retrieving memories
throughout the day-- you’re remembering

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:19.630
where you parked your car, or if you fed the
cat, or called your mom ‘cause it’s her

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:20.630
birthday.

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:23.190
You’ll remember from last week that while
our implicit memories--like how to talk and

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:28.770
ride a bike--are dealt with on a mostly automatic
and non-conscious level, our explicit memories--the

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:33.810
chronicles of our personal experiences and
general knowledge -- often require conscious,

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:34.850
effortful work.

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:40.580
Bernice had to notice, encode, store, and
later consciously retrieve details about the

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:44.980
crime she witnessed--what color was the guy’s
jacket, what did he look like, what did he

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:46.000
steal, and where did he run?

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.980
It takes a lot of work to retrieve memories
from long-term storage, and the truth is,

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:52.250
a lot can go wrong along the way.

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:57.170
In order to understand all of the many fascinating
ways you forget things, we need to talk more

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:58.590
about how we remember.

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:01.590
Our memories are not like books in the library
of your mind.

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:06.250
You don’t just pluck a neatly-packaged memory
-- about where you left your phone or the

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:07.630
hair color of a fruit thief.

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:12.549
Instead your memories are more like the spider
webs in the dank catacombs of your mind--a

00:02:12.549 --> 00:02:16.900
series of interconnected associations that
link all sorts of diverse things, as bits

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:19.540
of information get stuck to other bits of
information.

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:23.930
Like, maybe Bernice remembers that the night
of the crime was chilly with a full moon,

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:27.230
and that Beyonce was on the radio, and the
fruit truck had plates from California, which

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:28.880
is where her grandfather lives.

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:33.609
All those bits of information in the web of
memory--the weather, the song, the plates--can

00:02:33.609 --> 00:02:38.950
serve as retrieval cues, kind of like a trail
of breadcrumbs leading back to a particular

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:39.950
memory.

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:42.871
The more retrieval cues you inadvertently,
or intentionally, build along the way, the

00:02:42.871 --> 00:02:45.530
better you can backtrack and find the memory
you’re looking for.

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:50.689
This way of activating associations non-consciously
is called priming, sometimes called “memoryless

00:02:50.689 --> 00:02:51.689
memory”.

00:02:51.689 --> 00:02:56.200
It’s how “invisible memories” that you
didn’t know you had can awaken old associations.

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:58.569
Priming is how you often jog your memory.

00:02:58.569 --> 00:03:01.909
This kind of recall is sometimes referred
to as context-dependent memory.

00:03:01.909 --> 00:03:05.239
Say you’re reading in bed, and you want
to underline a quote, but you don’t have

00:03:05.239 --> 00:03:06.239
a pen.

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:08.681
You get up and go into the other room to find
your special light-up Hello Kitty pen, but

00:03:08.681 --> 00:03:12.529
you get distracted and suddenly you find yourself
in the kitchen; you’re like “Why?

00:03:12.529 --> 00:03:13.529
Why, mind?

00:03:13.529 --> 00:03:14.529
Why am I in the kitchen?

00:03:14.529 --> 00:03:15.529
What is here?

00:03:15.529 --> 00:03:18.989
Why am- there was a rea- and I don’t know
but I’m here now and agh!”

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:23.260
It’s only when you retrace your steps and
return to bed, to the initial context where

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:27.340
you read that quote and encoded that first
thought of wanting that pen, that the memory

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:28.340
comes back.

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:31.079
And then you’re like ‘oh, I need to go
get the pen.

00:03:31.079 --> 00:03:33.540
Ugh’
If some memories are context-dependent, others

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:36.669
are state-dependent, and also mood-congruent.

00:03:36.669 --> 00:03:40.489
This just means that our states and our emotions
can also serve as retrieval cues.

00:03:40.489 --> 00:03:44.190
If I had a throbbing headache and a super
bad day, I’m more likely to start recalling

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:47.669
bad memories, because I’m priming negative
associations.

00:03:47.669 --> 00:03:51.340
But of course if I’m relaxed and jolly,
I’m prone to remember happy times, which

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:52.609
are prolonging my good mood.

00:03:52.609 --> 00:03:57.090
Another funny memory-retrieval quirk speaks
not to our location or emotions, but to the

00:03:57.090 --> 00:03:59.560
order in which we receive new information.

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:03.019
So, say you make a grocery list in the morning,
but a few hours later, you’re at the store,

00:04:03.019 --> 00:04:04.549
you realize you left it at home.

00:04:04.549 --> 00:04:08.409
You’d be more likely to recall the first
items on the list--bananas and bread--and

00:04:08.409 --> 00:04:11.390
the last items--pickles and cheese--than anything
in the middle.

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:13.569
This is known as the serial position effect.

00:04:13.569 --> 00:04:17.199
This might be because the early words benefitted
from what’s known as the primacy effect,

00:04:17.199 --> 00:04:20.539
and made it into your long-term memory because
they were rehearsed more.

00:04:20.539 --> 00:04:24.569
Meanwhile, the last words lingered in the
working memory through the recency effect.

00:04:24.569 --> 00:04:28.820
But those poor middle words, they didn’t
benefit from either effect and therefore escaped

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:34.130
your brain, which is why you now have no toilet
paper, dog food, toothpaste, or cookies.

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:35.319
Who forgets cookies?

00:04:35.319 --> 00:04:40.650
But even with all these tricks and associations,
things still go wrong--memory can fail or

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:43.560
become distorted, and of course we forget
things.

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:46.980
Forgetfulness can be as minor as those frustrating
moments where you’re like ‘Ah, it’s

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:47.980
on the tip of my tongue.

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:51.919
It’s the guy, the guy’s got hair, and
a face, and, like, shoulders.’

00:04:51.919 --> 00:04:55.771
Or as major as Clive Wearing, whose neurological
damage made it impossible for him to recall

00:04:55.771 --> 00:04:57.930
the past or create new memories.

00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:02.849
Of course, we all forget things, and typically
we do it in one of three different ways: We

00:05:02.849 --> 00:05:08.370
fail to encode it, we fail to retrieve it,
or we experience what psychologists call storage

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:09.370
decay.

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:12.080
Sometimes forgetting something just means
it never really got through your encoding

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:13.490
process in the first place.

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:16.860
I mean, think of all the stuff that’s going
around you at any given moment.

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:20.520
We only actually notice a fraction of what
we sense, and we can only consciously hold

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:24.870
so many bits of information in our minds at
any given time, so what we fail to notice,

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:27.500
we tend to not encode, and thus don't remember.

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:32.699
Bernice noticed a dark jacket, Beyonce, and
bananas, but she didn’t encode much about

00:05:32.699 --> 00:05:34.909
the driver, or the color of the thief’s
shoes.

00:05:34.909 --> 00:05:39.340
Then again, even memories that have been encoded
are still vulnerable to storage decay, or

00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:41.479
natural forgetting over time.

00:05:41.479 --> 00:05:44.580
Interestingly, even though we can forget things
pretty quickly, the amount of data that we

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:46.860
forget can actually levels off after a while.

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:49.751
This means that Bernice would have forgotten
about half of what she first noticed from

00:05:49.751 --> 00:05:53.599
the crime scene a couple days later, but what
she still remembered, she’d likely hang

00:05:53.599 --> 00:05:56.539
on to, because the rate at which we forget
tends to plateau.

00:05:56.539 --> 00:06:00.970
A lot of times forgetting doesn’t mean our
memory just faded to black, it means we can’t

00:06:00.970 --> 00:06:03.550
call it up on demand because of retrieval
failure.

00:06:03.550 --> 00:06:08.150
We all know the common tip-of-the-tongue phenomenon
where you feel like you know the name of that

00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:11.650
weird-looking hard-backed animal that rolls
up into ball.

00:06:11.650 --> 00:06:16.080
It’s kind of cute and weird and I think
they get leprosy or something…what is it?!

00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:18.319
This is where retrieval cues can come in handy.

00:06:18.319 --> 00:06:21.960
If I say is starts with the letter A, you
may suddenly unlock the information--Armadillo!

00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:25.539
Sometimes these retrieval problems stem from
interference from other memories getting in

00:06:25.539 --> 00:06:28.200
the way, essentially cluttering the brain.

00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:31.289
Sometimes, old stuff that you’ve learned
keeps you from recalling new stuff -- like,

00:06:31.289 --> 00:06:34.770
if you change one of your passwords, but keep
recalling your old one every time you try

00:06:34.770 --> 00:06:35.770
to log in.

00:06:35.770 --> 00:06:38.009
That’s called proactive, or forward-acting,
interference.

00:06:38.009 --> 00:06:43.410
The flip side is retroactive, or backward-acting,
interference, which happens when new learning

00:06:43.410 --> 00:06:47.080
gets in the way of recalling old information,
like if you start studying Spanish, it may

00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:49.120
interfere with the French that you’ve already
learned.

00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:53.659
There’s a lot of reconstruction and inferring
involved when you try to flesh out a memory,

00:06:53.659 --> 00:06:58.289
and every time you replay it in your mind,
or relate it to a friend, it changes, just

00:06:58.289 --> 00:06:59.319
a little.

00:06:59.319 --> 00:07:03.449
So in a way, we’re all sort of perpetually
re-writing our pasts.

00:07:03.449 --> 00:07:07.770
While this is an inevitable part of human
nature, it can prove dangerous at times.

00:07:07.770 --> 00:07:11.020
Misleading information can get incorporated
into a memory, and twist the truth - and yes

00:07:11.020 --> 00:07:13.710
there is an effect for this; it’s called
the misinformation effect.

00:07:13.710 --> 00:07:18.740
American psychologist and memory expert Elizabeth
Loftus has spent decades showing how eyewitnesses

00:07:18.740 --> 00:07:22.810
inadvertently tweak and reconstruct their
memories after accidents or crimes.

00:07:22.810 --> 00:07:26.400
In one experiment, two groups watched a film
of a car accident.

00:07:26.400 --> 00:07:30.349
Those asked how fast the cars were going when
they smashed into each other estimated much

00:07:30.349 --> 00:07:34.740
higher speeds than those who were asked about
the cars hitting each other.

00:07:34.740 --> 00:07:39.450
Smash is the leading word that essentially
altered the witnesses’ memories -- so much

00:07:39.450 --> 00:07:43.600
so that a week later, when both groups were
asked if they saw any broken glass, those

00:07:43.600 --> 00:07:48.900
who heard the word smash were twice as likely
to report seeing bits of glass, when in fact,

00:07:48.900 --> 00:07:50.151
the original film didn’t show any.

00:07:50.151 --> 00:07:54.290
In Bernice’s case, chances are her memory
of the robbery would be altered if the prosecution

00:07:54.290 --> 00:07:57.310
said the thief assaulted, rather than pushed
the driver.

00:07:57.310 --> 00:08:02.099
This sort of interfering or misleading information
may also manifest itself as source misattribution,

00:08:02.099 --> 00:08:05.479
like when we forget or misrecall the source
of a memory.

00:08:05.479 --> 00:08:09.470
In the case of Bernice, when she saw the suspect
in the courtroom, she thought she recognized

00:08:09.470 --> 00:08:13.169
him from the night of the crime, when in reality,
he’d just served her coffee earlier that

00:08:13.169 --> 00:08:14.169
day.

00:08:14.169 --> 00:08:17.129
But her memory of the event had probably already
been tweaked several times before she even

00:08:17.129 --> 00:08:18.610
made it into the courtroom.

00:08:18.610 --> 00:08:22.539
Like she re-lived the tale multiple times,
in her own mind or when she told other people

00:08:22.539 --> 00:08:27.889
about it, and every time she introduced errors,
filling in memory gaps with reasonable guesses.

00:08:27.889 --> 00:08:31.870
Not only that, but we know Bernice was already
tired and stressed when she witnessed the

00:08:31.870 --> 00:08:36.680
event, and we know our emotions can influence
both what we remember and what we forget.

00:08:36.680 --> 00:08:41.430
Because memory is both a reconstruction and
a reproduction of past events, we can’t

00:08:41.430 --> 00:08:45.380
ever really be sure if a memory is real just
because it feels real.

00:08:45.380 --> 00:08:47.079
Elizabeth Loftus knows this.

00:08:47.079 --> 00:08:50.040
She’s frequently called in to testify against
the accuracy of eyewitnesses.

00:08:50.040 --> 00:08:54.639
In fact, of all the U.S. prisoners who have
been exonerated based on DNA evidence presented

00:08:54.639 --> 00:09:00.180
by Innocence Project, a non-profit legal group,
75 percent of them were convicted by mistaken

00:09:00.180 --> 00:09:01.180
eyewitnesses.

00:09:01.180 --> 00:09:03.040
That is a lot of innocent people.

00:09:03.040 --> 00:09:07.290
Bernice meant well of course, she’s an honest
enough lady, but all these factors--the emotion,

00:09:07.290 --> 00:09:11.110
the retelling, the suggestions of outside
sources-- combined with the darkness, the

00:09:11.110 --> 00:09:16.420
quick glimpse, the passing of time, maybe
even the Beyonce, ended up leading to a mistake

00:09:16.420 --> 00:09:17.840
in the thief’s identification.

00:09:17.840 --> 00:09:21.090
Turns out the human memory is actually a very
fragile thing.

00:09:21.090 --> 00:09:24.590
We’re all largely the product of the stories
that we tell ourselves.

00:09:24.590 --> 00:09:28.950
If you haven’t forgotten already, today
you learned about how our memories are stored

00:09:28.950 --> 00:09:34.260
in webs of association, aided by retrieval
cues and priming, and influenced by context

00:09:34.260 --> 00:09:35.260
and mood.

00:09:35.260 --> 00:09:39.910
You also learned how we forget information,
how our memories are susceptible to interference

00:09:39.910 --> 00:09:45.240
