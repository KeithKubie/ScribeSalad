00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:22.720
This year the Ri things have been very space-themed,
so we're making a very special demo film for

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:26.199
you, looking at all the fun little experiments
that they've done aboard the ISS.

00:00:26.199 --> 00:00:30.640
The recreate a spacey weightless environment,
we took a page out of the astronaut training

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:36.210
book and sent Kevin Fong, this year's Christmas
Lecturer, on a parabolic flight. A parabolic

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:40.620
flight can create pockets of weightlessness
by going into free-fall mode. We wanted to

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:44.260
look particularly at how water behaves in
microgravity.

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:48.760
The major force acting on water in microgravity
is surface tension. In a drop of water you

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:52.750
have molecules that are being pulled equally
in every direction by the molecules that surround

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:57.100
them. The water molecules on the surface of
the droplet don't have water molecules surrounding

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:02.190
them on all sides, so are pulled inwards towards
the centre of the droplet. This imbalance

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:06.330
of forces creates an internal pressure that
forces the molecules into a shape that has

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:10.509
the minimum surface area while maintaining
a cohesive surface.

00:01:10.509 --> 00:01:14.429
This also explains why droplets are round:
the spherical shape minimises the surface

00:01:14.429 --> 00:01:19.740
tension needed, as described by Laplace's
law. The effects of this force on Earth are

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:25.000
relatively weak because gravity counteracts
it quite strongly. In space, however, surface

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.850
tension really comes into its own.

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:35.300
For the first one I have this wet towel. You
can see it's quite wet, but when I wring it

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:43.451
out, all the water leaves and it's left pretty
much dry. In space it's a bit different. You

00:01:43.451 --> 00:01:47.600
can see Kevin wringing the towel while floating
in mid air, but the water isn't behaving like

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:53.130
we just saw. Instead it's bunching around
his hands, and occasionally small globules

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:57.380
break free when he shakes his hands. Without
gravity to pull the water downwards, the surface

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:02.099
tension keeps water adhering to itself, and
turns it almost into a gel-like substance

00:02:02.099 --> 00:02:07.110
that clings to most surfaces. Water is quite
special in this regard because it clings very

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:10.200
strongly due to its hydrogen bonds.

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:15.970
The second demonstration is an excellent study
of fluid forces. What I have here is a beaker

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:20.980
full of water and a ping pong ball floating
on top. It's pretty obvious that the ball

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:26.240
would be floating, because it's full of air,
and air is lighter thanw ater. The question

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:30.090
is, what would happen in microgravity? You
might expect that everything would move upwards,

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:32.910
but the reality is much cooler:

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:36.800
The ping pong ball is covered in a layer of
paint that makes it hydrophilic. This means

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:41.840
that it's wettable and the water wants to
creep over the ball. When we remove gravity

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:48.090
from the equation, the ball sinks into the
water.

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:51.790
As you just saw, water does some incredible
things in a weightless, space-like environment.

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:56.600
I wish we could've shown you more. For more
