00:00:08.436 --> 00:00:10.116
&gt;&gt;Principal: Couple of things
we're gonna cover today.

00:00:10.116 --> 00:00:13.126
One is a midday block
schedule for next year,

00:00:13.126 --> 00:00:14.886
so we could actually
start planning now.

00:00:15.286 --> 00:00:17.956
&gt;&gt;Narrator: It's not easy
being a principal these days.

00:00:17.956 --> 00:00:21.436
Among other things, you've
got to be a financial wizard.

00:00:21.436 --> 00:00:23.406
&gt;&gt;Rich: Well, I think we need
to look at what the priorities

00:00:23.406 --> 00:00:24.336
in the budget are gonna be.

00:00:24.876 --> 00:00:26.406
&gt;&gt;Narrator: A savvy politician.

00:00:26.406 --> 00:00:29.616
&gt;&gt;Principal: -- back from Bell
South Foundation for our grant.

00:00:30.186 --> 00:00:32.116
&gt;&gt;Narrator: And an
educational visionary.

00:00:32.116 --> 00:00:36.366
&gt;&gt;There has to be exploration
and it has to be decided

00:00:36.366 --> 00:00:38.126
by the children, not by the teachers.

00:00:38.356 --> 00:00:41.006
&gt;&gt;Narrator: And you've
also go to know what to do

00:00:41.006 --> 00:00:43.426
with the kid who's throwing
food in the cafeteria.

00:00:43.546 --> 00:00:43.726
&gt;&gt;Rich: Yeah.

00:00:43.906 --> 00:00:46.726
&gt;&gt;Woman: Since I saw you last and
actually talked to you about that,

00:00:46.726 --> 00:00:49.626
he had to throw a slushie
clear across the cafeteria.

00:00:49.676 --> 00:00:50.076
&gt;&gt;Rich: Oh no.

00:00:50.206 --> 00:00:52.986
&gt;&gt;Narrator: With daily
challenges and mounting pressures,

00:00:53.386 --> 00:00:55.946
it's perhaps not surprising
that forty percent

00:00:55.946 --> 00:00:59.896
of current principals are planning
to retire in the next decade.

00:00:59.986 --> 00:01:01.606
&gt;&gt;Woman: So what do you think
we should do with him now?

00:01:02.416 --> 00:01:05.616
&gt;&gt;Rich: We can sit down with him,
because we just can't have this kind

00:01:05.616 --> 00:01:09.596
of behavior happening,
at a constant level.

00:01:10.006 --> 00:01:12.786
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Problem solving
is nothing new to Rich Kuder,

00:01:13.046 --> 00:01:16.676
who spent years as a classroom
teacher and assistant principal.

00:01:17.246 --> 00:01:21.106
But in his first year as principal of
Eisenhower Middle School in Wyckoff,

00:01:21.106 --> 00:01:25.666
New Jersey, he has to come up with
all the right answers all the time.

00:01:25.666 --> 00:01:26.756
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Keep the
kids in the center

00:01:26.756 --> 00:01:28.546
and start the cut from the outside.

00:01:28.916 --> 00:01:31.696
&gt;&gt;Rich: As a first year
principal, you have to get a sense

00:01:31.696 --> 00:01:34.736
of the culture, of how
things are done in a school.

00:01:34.736 --> 00:01:38.626
You know, there's sort of the
written rules about how things work

00:01:38.626 --> 00:01:41.346
and then there's the unwritten
rules about how things work,

00:01:41.596 --> 00:01:45.696
and you really need to be attuned
to those, and work not only

00:01:45.746 --> 00:01:49.326
to understand it, but
then also if need be,

00:01:49.576 --> 00:01:51.746
change some of those
operating assumptions.

00:01:52.726 --> 00:01:53.726
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Okay, very good.

00:01:54.086 --> 00:01:58.446
&gt;&gt;Jim: You certainly need a person
who can think on their feet,

00:01:58.596 --> 00:02:00.246
and come to creative solutions.

00:02:00.296 --> 00:02:02.646
&gt;&gt;Rich: But there's a slight
itinerary change in the Philly trip.

00:02:03.106 --> 00:02:06.526
&gt;&gt;Jim: A good leader is a
person who can relate to people

00:02:06.526 --> 00:02:11.056
and have them come along on a
mission, have them grab on and engage

00:02:11.056 --> 00:02:14.486
with that mission and
see it to its finality.

00:02:14.566 --> 00:02:16.496
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Fortunately,
Kuder has been able to turn

00:02:16.496 --> 00:02:18.696
to another principal
for critical advice.

00:02:19.446 --> 00:02:20.566
&gt;&gt;Tony: Okay, you get the idea?

00:02:21.906 --> 00:02:22.876
Okay, don't raise your hand.

00:02:22.876 --> 00:02:24.726
Just kinda look at me.

00:02:24.776 --> 00:02:25.746
I can read your faces.

00:02:26.326 --> 00:02:26.393
So--

00:02:26.486 --> 00:02:28.546
&gt;&gt;Narrator: His former
boss, Tony Bencivenga,

00:02:28.546 --> 00:02:32.416
is principal at Ben Franklin
Middle School in nearby Ridgewood,

00:02:32.466 --> 00:02:35.336
and every few weeks,
Bencivenga visits his protege

00:02:35.336 --> 00:02:36.666
to renew their friendship

00:02:36.996 --> 00:02:39.546
and continue their informal
mentorship arrangement.

00:02:39.546 --> 00:02:40.516
&gt;&gt;Tony: How are the
kids doing, all right?

00:02:40.516 --> 00:02:41.546
&gt;&gt;Rich: Yeah, they're doing great.

00:02:41.616 --> 00:02:41.736
&gt;&gt;Tony: Good.

00:02:42.096 --> 00:02:44.666
&gt;&gt;Narrator: One of the most
successful programs Kuder has brought

00:02:44.666 --> 00:02:47.146
to Eisenhower is a
daily news broadcast,

00:02:47.396 --> 00:02:51.146
patterned after a program he launched
with his mentor at Ben Franklin.

00:02:51.736 --> 00:02:54.776
&gt;&gt;Boy: Eisenhower wishes farewell to
Emily Murphy as she moves to Oakland.

00:02:55.166 --> 00:02:55.606
Best wishes--

00:02:55.606 --> 00:02:58.116
&gt;&gt;Tony: You've been live every day
since the beginning of the year?

00:02:58.296 --> 00:03:00.216
&gt;&gt;Rich: Yeah, I mean a few
days into the year, you know,

00:03:00.216 --> 00:03:02.346
we started going with a live show.

00:03:02.566 --> 00:03:03.306
&gt;&gt;Tony: Right, right.

00:03:03.576 --> 00:03:03.966
&gt;&gt;Rich: Every day.

00:03:04.166 --> 00:03:04.726
&gt;&gt;Tony: Every day.

00:03:04.726 --> 00:03:05.226
&gt;&gt;Rich: Every day.

00:03:05.656 --> 00:03:09.446
&gt;&gt;Tony: The children, they're
really directing their learning.

00:03:09.836 --> 00:03:11.946
&gt;&gt;Rich: This is about
them, the opportunity

00:03:11.946 --> 00:03:13.976
to do this is really up to them.

00:03:13.976 --> 00:03:16.676
They understand what needs
to do in order to get a show

00:03:16.676 --> 00:03:18.396
out and to do a great job.

00:03:18.396 --> 00:03:20.206
And they work and critique
themselves.

00:03:20.206 --> 00:03:21.976
&gt;&gt;Tony: That's the authentic
assessment we talked about.

00:03:22.286 --> 00:03:23.466
And how about project based learning?

00:03:23.706 --> 00:03:25.756
You know, you're talking
about working on a project.

00:03:26.096 --> 00:03:27.786
This is project based
learning every day.

00:03:28.016 --> 00:03:29.106
&gt;&gt;Rich: Every student that's in here

00:03:29.106 --> 00:03:32.746
at eight thirty tomorrow morning
will have an opportunity to say like,

00:03:32.796 --> 00:03:34.516
"You know what, I really
did something today.

00:03:34.516 --> 00:03:34.836
A real thing.

00:03:34.836 --> 00:03:35.906
Everybody saw my broadcast."

00:03:35.906 --> 00:03:36.146
&gt;&gt;Tony: Exactly.

00:03:36.216 --> 00:03:37.186
&gt;&gt;Rich: This was a
great accomplishment.

00:03:37.296 --> 00:03:37.896
&gt;&gt;Tony: Right, right.

00:03:37.896 --> 00:03:39.236
&gt;&gt;You don't work with a teleprompter?

00:03:39.356 --> 00:03:39.426
You--

00:03:39.426 --> 00:03:40.766
&gt;&gt;Rich: No, we don't
work with a teleprompter.

00:03:40.766 --> 00:03:41.756
&gt;&gt;Tony: Because you
know, we don't either.

00:03:41.816 --> 00:03:43.256
And I think you and
I talked about that.

00:03:43.256 --> 00:03:45.156
&gt;&gt;Rich: Well, and again, that's
kind of a conscious decision.

00:03:45.526 --> 00:03:47.836
&gt;&gt;Rich: You need somebody
to bounce things off of.

00:03:47.836 --> 00:03:50.516
It's wonderful to have
someone, a friend like Tony,

00:03:50.676 --> 00:03:53.796
who will be up front and honest
with you about, you know,

00:03:53.886 --> 00:03:55.156
"Well, I think you're right.

00:03:55.156 --> 00:03:57.926
I think your line of thinking
is right on the money," or,

00:03:58.006 --> 00:04:00.336
"Have you considered this
about your position?"

00:04:00.586 --> 00:04:02.096
&gt;&gt;Rich: So it's been
a great relationship.

00:04:02.096 --> 00:04:03.426
It's been really beneficial for me.

00:04:03.546 --> 00:04:06.006
&gt;&gt;Tony: And what you always talked
about, the reality based learning.

00:04:06.286 --> 00:04:07.936
This is a perfect example of it.

00:04:08.616 --> 00:04:10.536
&gt;&gt;Teacher: We have the
geographical location,

00:04:11.126 --> 00:04:13.396
geology, climate, living things.

00:04:14.046 --> 00:04:16.456
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Kuder inherited
a highly rated school.

00:04:16.796 --> 00:04:19.996
His challenge is to maintain
the current high standards while

00:04:19.996 --> 00:04:21.586
advancing his personal agenda.

00:04:22.106 --> 00:04:24.906
&gt;&gt;Rich: It sounds to me like what
you're working on is ambitious

00:04:25.006 --> 00:04:27.236
and appropriate, so I
would go with that unless--

00:04:27.396 --> 00:04:31.616
&gt;&gt;As a principal, I have tried to
articulate my vision with my staff,

00:04:31.696 --> 00:04:35.196
meeting the individual needs of
kids, attending to the social

00:04:35.196 --> 00:04:36.496
and emotional needs of kids,

00:04:37.026 --> 00:04:39.386
providing strong reality
based programs,

00:04:39.616 --> 00:04:41.576
infusing technology
into the curriculum.

00:04:41.926 --> 00:04:44.906
Even in our faculty meetings,
we spend time talking about,

00:04:44.906 --> 00:04:49.436
what does it mean to have a culture
in your classroom where kids feel

00:04:49.936 --> 00:04:53.526
like they're accepted, where they
feel safe, where they can take risks?

00:04:53.816 --> 00:04:55.386
&gt;&gt;Teacher: You'll be
working cooperatively

00:04:55.476 --> 00:04:56.626
in groups to accomplish this task.

00:04:57.266 --> 00:04:59.826
You gotta find the name of the
person, date of birth and death,

00:05:00.086 --> 00:05:02.796
their revolutionary role and their
major beliefs and accomplishments.

00:05:03.456 --> 00:05:07.036
All right, so we'll
go to that home page.

00:05:08.786 --> 00:05:12.056
All right, the time, you
will have twenty minutes

00:05:12.056 --> 00:05:13.486
to get this accomplished.

00:05:13.706 --> 00:05:15.856
&gt;&gt;Student: Oh, here we go.

00:05:15.966 --> 00:05:19.576
&gt;&gt;Student: It says that
the most important thing

00:05:19.606 --> 00:05:22.356
in society is the way
people earn their money.

00:05:23.516 --> 00:05:26.986
&gt;&gt;Student: Bolsheviks came
to power, blah, blah, blah.

00:05:27.366 --> 00:05:30.136
The orthodox church was an enemy.

00:05:30.996 --> 00:05:32.896
So they helped the czar of Russia.

00:05:34.436 --> 00:05:37.246
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Monitoring this sixth
grade Russian history lesson,

00:05:37.656 --> 00:05:40.516
Kuder sees his educational
vision come to life.

00:05:40.936 --> 00:05:45.196
&gt;&gt;Student: Like after he was
banished from the Soviet Union,

00:05:45.516 --> 00:05:48.786
he criticized Stalin's
rule, like a lot,

00:05:49.496 --> 00:05:52.926
and then he was assassined
in Mexico in 1940.

00:05:53.986 --> 00:05:55.116
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Okay, very good.

00:05:55.276 --> 00:05:57.046
Very good job, Josh.

00:05:58.416 --> 00:06:00.406
&gt;&gt;Narrator: During a
quick brown bag lunch,

00:06:00.406 --> 00:06:03.296
Kuder enjoys a stress
reduction ritual he picked

00:06:03.296 --> 00:06:06.666
up from his old boss, indulging
in a rerun of "The Honeymooners."

00:06:07.186 --> 00:06:07.586
&gt;&gt;Tony: There he is.

00:06:07.586 --> 00:06:08.636
&gt;&gt;Ralph Kramden: There'll
be no snoozing.

00:06:08.636 --> 00:06:10.426
Norton, I said don't snooze.

00:06:10.976 --> 00:06:11.556
&gt;&gt;Tony: How're things going?

00:06:12.136 --> 00:06:12.636
&gt;&gt;Rich: All right.

00:06:12.916 --> 00:06:14.956
&gt;&gt;We're working on
staffing for next year.

00:06:15.386 --> 00:06:18.246
We have an incoming sixth grade
class next year of over two hundred

00:06:18.246 --> 00:06:21.936
and eighty kids, and so
we're looking at, you know,

00:06:22.296 --> 00:06:24.656
how to keep class sizes manageable.

00:06:24.986 --> 00:06:26.706
&gt;&gt;Tony: We have a similar
problem with the staffing.

00:06:26.886 --> 00:06:30.716
The dilemma I'm facing right
now is, what's more critical,

00:06:30.926 --> 00:06:32.766
the seventh grade or the sixth grade?

00:06:32.866 --> 00:06:35.626
And my feeling is that maybe
the transition from fifth

00:06:35.626 --> 00:06:38.906
to sixth is the more critical
moment, and I really need--

00:06:38.906 --> 00:06:41.116
&gt;&gt;The joy of what I do
and the joy that I know

00:06:41.116 --> 00:06:43.616
that Rich feels is the joy
of being with the kids.

00:06:43.956 --> 00:06:44.336
&gt;&gt;Rich: You guys okay?

00:06:44.616 --> 00:06:44.816
&gt;&gt;Student: Yep.

00:06:45.526 --> 00:06:49.146
&gt;&gt;Tony: I've been in education for
thirty five years and I still get

00:06:49.146 --> 00:06:52.186
up in the morning, knowing that
I'm gonna face a challenging day,

00:06:52.186 --> 00:06:53.406
but I'm gonna face a great day.

00:06:53.846 --> 00:06:56.346
It's gonna be an exciting
day, watching the kids learn.

00:06:56.446 --> 00:06:59.756
&gt;&gt;I am so proud of what
you all do in this school.

00:06:59.756 --> 00:07:06.166
&gt;&gt;To watch children learn and grow
and be happy is very rewarding.

00:07:06.386 --> 00:07:10.196
