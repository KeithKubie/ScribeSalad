00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
We are now two steps away from the confidence interval. We're almost there.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
The first thing we do is we go back from the quadratic expression

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.000
down to the non-quadratic expression--the standard deviation that corresponds to the variance over here.

00:00:11.000 --> 99:59:59.000
You're ready now to compute this. Just give me those three values over here.
