00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:03.080
This time we make sure that
the new recording label and

00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:07.810
stop button stay in the correct
position and size, at all times.

00:00:07.810 --> 00:00:09.395
Much like the original record button,

00:00:09.395 --> 00:00:12.190
we need to add constraints to
these two interface elements.

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:17.650
First we have to think about what we
want, which is three UI elements,

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:20.500
one beneath the other,
centered on screen.

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:23.370
They should always be in the center,

00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:27.380
regardless if we're running the app on
a small iPhone or the new iPad Pro.

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:31.240
We already have a recording button
centered on the main UI View

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:32.740
over our View Controller so

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:36.120
we can anchor the other two
views off the recording button.

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:38.640
Let's start with the recording label.

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:43.720
The recording label is this one
here that says tap to record.

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:47.770
With it selected, let's control drag
diagonally to the record button.

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:53.800
The menu that comes up is context
sensitive to the direction of the drag.

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:55.720
If you just do a straight up and down or

00:00:55.720 --> 00:01:00.060
left to right drag, you only get
a subset of the constrained options.

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:03.210
With the shift key held down,
select vertical spacing and

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:07.370
centered horizontally,
then click add constraints.

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:10.150
This means that we want to maintain
the vertical spacing from the recording

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:11.400
button to this label, and

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:15.350
then we want to label to be centered
horizontally to the record button.

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:18.480
So how does auto layout know where
the label needs to be on screen?

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:21.520
It checks to see where the record
button is and placed this label,

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:25.090
based on that, using the two
constraints that you've just setup.

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:26.610
If you're remembering back to earlier,

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:28.560
how I mentioned that there
are two constraints needed for

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:32.370
each axis, two for the x and
two for the y, you're correct.

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:37.930
However the label, much like
the UIButton, has an intrinsic size.

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:39.830
So auto layout can figure
out the height and

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:43.970
width of the label based on the text and
font of the label.

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:48.130
So all we need to provide is where
to place it along the x and y-axis.

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:52.880
In other words, just one constraint for
the x and one constraint for the y.

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:56.200
Let's set up the constraints of the stop
recording button against the tap to

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:57.910
record label.

00:01:57.910 --> 00:02:00.680
Once more, drag the agony from
to stop recording button to

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:02.800
the tap to record label.

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:05.970
With the shift key pressed down,
select vertical spacing and

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:09.270
center horizontally,
then click add constraints.

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:13.160
We should be able to see six
constraints under the constraints

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:14.640
section of the document outline.

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:19.660
Your number here inside these
constraints may vary a little bit from

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:24.590
20 to 21 to 23 and they may be a little
different than mine and that's ok.

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:27.590
They're based on where you placed
your UI elements in the storyboards

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:28.940
when you dragged them in.

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:30.190
Let's see if this worked.

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:32.230
Click run or press command R and

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:35.920
you should see the Pitch Perfect
app running on the iOS simulator.

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:38.670
Let's try different screen orientations
to see if they stay centered.

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:42.810
You can see here that they stay
center of the landscape and would see

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:46.610
the same if we switch to different
iOS simulators such as the iPad air.

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:52.110
We should see here, that our three
buttons are always centered on screen.

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:55.520
Remember it may seem frustrating now,
that's okay.

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:56.420
You're just learning and

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:59.672
this is likely one of the first
times you've tried auto layout.

00:02:59.672 --> 00:03:02.210
Keep at it and
it'll become second nature in no time.
