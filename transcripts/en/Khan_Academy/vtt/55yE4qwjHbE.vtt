00:00:00.301 --> 00:00:02.484
- The initial pH and the equivalence point

00:00:02.484 --> 00:00:04.458
are plotted on the graph below.

00:00:04.458 --> 00:00:08.335
Accurately sketch the titration
curve on the graph below.

00:00:08.335 --> 00:00:10.623
Mark the position of the
half-equivalence point

00:00:10.623 --> 00:00:13.293
on the curve with an X.

00:00:13.293 --> 00:00:16.293
All right, so we have, they show us

00:00:18.319 --> 00:00:22.905
the initial pH right over
here, and they also show us

00:00:22.905 --> 00:00:25.891
the equivalence point right over here.

00:00:25.891 --> 00:00:28.021
And it's at a pH of, we actually saw that

00:00:28.021 --> 00:00:29.895
in the last problem with equivalence,

00:00:29.895 --> 00:00:32.217
the equivalence point, or
actually a couple of problems ago,

00:00:32.217 --> 00:00:33.882
the equivalence point was measured,

00:00:33.882 --> 00:00:37.098
the pH at the equivalence
point was measured to be 2.54,

00:00:37.098 --> 00:00:41.417
so that's why this right
over here is at 2.54

00:00:41.417 --> 00:00:44.122
when we've added about 29 point,

00:00:44.122 --> 00:00:45.445
I forgot what the number was.

00:00:45.445 --> 00:00:48.336
It was in, I think, the
second part of this problem.

00:00:48.336 --> 00:00:50.462
They said when you added
close to 30 milliliters

00:00:50.462 --> 00:00:53.342
of that hydrochloric acid, that 1.25

00:00:53.342 --> 00:00:55.548
molar hydrochloric acid solution,

00:00:55.548 --> 00:00:57.928
that is when we hit our equivalence point.

00:00:57.928 --> 00:01:00.041
And we see the pH right over there,

00:01:00.041 --> 00:01:02.142
and then the half-equivalence point.

00:01:02.142 --> 00:01:04.720
Well, that's going to be when
we've added half this amount.

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:08.179
So it's going to be a
little bit less than 15,

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:10.188
and we in the last problem, we figured out

00:01:10.188 --> 00:01:13.519
that that was going to be at a pH of 4.77.

00:01:13.519 --> 00:01:18.106
So a pH of 4.77 is going
to be something like,

00:01:18.106 --> 00:01:21.205
right over there, they
said mark that with an X.

00:01:21.205 --> 00:01:23.527
So half-equivalence
point, we've added half

00:01:23.527 --> 00:01:26.998
the titrate there, and we know the pH.

00:01:26.998 --> 00:01:29.367
We figured that out in the
last part of the problem.

00:01:29.367 --> 00:01:32.141
And now we just need to graph,

00:01:32.141 --> 00:01:34.626
we need to sketch the titration curve.

00:01:34.626 --> 00:01:36.077
So let's see.

00:01:36.077 --> 00:01:40.025
We keep adding more and
more hydrochloric acid.

00:01:40.025 --> 00:01:43.025
Hydrochloric acid, it lowers the pH.

00:01:44.227 --> 00:01:46.967
We get to the half-equivalence point.

00:01:46.967 --> 00:01:48.337
And then actually, we're going to

00:01:48.337 --> 00:01:50.801
start leveling off over here.

00:01:50.801 --> 00:01:54.178
The reason why you level off
is 'cause you're going to have,

00:01:54.178 --> 00:01:58.413
you're going to have more and
more of the conjugate acid

00:01:58.413 --> 00:02:02.580
there, and so as you react
with the conjugate base,

00:02:03.591 --> 00:02:05.251
with more and more of the conjugate base,

00:02:05.251 --> 00:02:06.993
the equilibrium between the conjugate base

00:02:06.993 --> 00:02:08.479
and the conjugate acid,
the more of that acid

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:09.838
is going to go to conjugate base.

00:02:09.838 --> 00:02:11.173
So you're going to have a
little bit of a buffering

00:02:11.173 --> 00:02:14.609
going on, but at some
point you have reacted.

00:02:14.609 --> 00:02:17.976
You have completely
reacted with everything,

00:02:17.976 --> 00:02:20.797
and you've hit your equivalence point.

00:02:20.797 --> 00:02:22.377
You hit your equivalence point.

00:02:22.377 --> 00:02:25.952
And then, and you become much more acidic,

00:02:25.952 --> 00:02:28.194
and it might look something,

00:02:28.194 --> 00:02:31.676
it might look something like that.

00:02:31.676 --> 00:02:34.834
Let me see if I can do
a little bit better,

00:02:34.834 --> 00:02:36.540
a little bit better job.

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:39.431
So it would look something,

00:02:39.431 --> 00:02:42.671
and we're obviously, it's not
going to be exactly right.

00:02:42.671 --> 00:02:44.818
It's important we go
through these three points.

00:02:44.818 --> 00:02:47.593
And it would look something like that.

00:02:47.593 --> 00:02:49.009
So that's the equivalence point,

00:02:49.009 --> 00:02:53.176
half-equivalence point, and
then this is our initial pH.
