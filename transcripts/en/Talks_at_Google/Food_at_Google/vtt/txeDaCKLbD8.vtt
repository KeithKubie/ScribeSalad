[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:12.320
SPEAKER: So to start,
tell us a little bit

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:15.520
about your background and
how you got into cooking.

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:16.520
MELISSA KING: Let's see.

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:18.936
Well, first off I want to say
thank you guys for having me

00:00:18.936 --> 00:00:20.670
here.

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:23.730
I love seeing all the strong,
powerful women out here.

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:27.510
A big girl group here at Google.

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:29.010
So how did I start
off with cooking?

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:30.710
I've been cooking
since I was a kid.

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:35.510
Yeah, I think I was maybe five
or six and helping out my mom.

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:38.450
Both my parents are
engineers, and they're just

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:39.460
working all the time.

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:43.610
And someone had to put food on
the table, so by the age of 12

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:44.900
I was doing that.

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:49.430
And then went to college, got my
undergrad in cognitive science

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:51.110
at UC Irvine.

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:55.010
But I wanted to cook my
whole life since I was young,

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:59.990
and finally I made my way to
culinary school in New York.

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:04.190
And then I've been in San
Francisco since cooking.

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:05.069
SPEAKER: Awesome.

00:01:05.069 --> 00:01:08.690
What made you take that step
into cooking from leaving--

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:10.620
from what you were studying?

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:13.010
MELISSA KING: I think
just because that's

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:15.530
what I had known I'd
wanted to do my whole life,

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:19.790
but I felt a little
suppressed by my family.

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:22.310
I grew up in a really
traditional household.

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:27.980
I'm sure many people can
feel that, or relate to that,

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:31.190
with having parents that expect
you to be something else.

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:33.650
And they're like, are you
sure you want to be a chef?

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:36.680
That's just a lot of work,
and you're sweating all day,

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:39.350
and you're in a
kitchen long hours.

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:42.530
You're working every
holiday, every weekend.

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:43.740
But I loved it that much.

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:44.990
And I was like, you know what?

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:46.790
This is what I want
to do with my life,

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:47.910
and I'm going to do it.

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:52.400
And so I kind of did
schooling to please my family,

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:56.730
but eventually kind of went
off and did my own thing.

00:01:56.730 --> 00:02:01.157
SPEAKER: So as you welcomed
all the women engineers here--

00:02:01.157 --> 00:02:02.240
MELISSA KING: And the men.

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:04.040
SPEAKER: And the men, yeah.

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:06.680
So you faced a lot
of struggles coming

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:08.770
with the traditional
family and all that.

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:12.110
And there's not a
giant percentage

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:17.300
of women culinary master
chefs and all that, and also

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:21.400
part of the LGBTQ community.

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:25.050
What other challenges did
you have going through that,

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:28.100
and what challenges
do you see for others?

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:29.840
MELISSA KING: You
know, I started out

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:33.200
in the industry I'd
say 15 years ago.

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:36.830
And at the time there really
weren't many female chefs

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:38.030
in the media.

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:41.180
There weren't many in kitchens.

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:45.230
I was one of the only
girls for a very long time.

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:46.500
And it's tough.

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:49.946
They treat you different.

00:02:49.946 --> 00:02:52.070
But you know, for me, I
just kind of stuck with it.

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:54.020
I'm like, this is what
I love, and it's not

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:59.360
about my gender or any
personal parts of who I am.

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:01.550
End of the day it's just
how dedicated you are

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:06.260
and how passionate you are
about what you're doing.

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:10.670
So I just kind of stayed
focused and ended up

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:13.670
working for Dominique Crenn,
which was the first female chef

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:14.480
that I worked for.

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:16.640
And that was an
amazing experience

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:21.290
to be able to have someone
that was getting recognized

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:25.190
in the industry at
that time, and to be

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:26.880
able to train with her.

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:29.720
So there was sort of this
role model, like wow,

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:30.410
she's doing it.

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:32.120
I can do this.

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:35.570
And I think times are changing.

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:40.440
Now you just see there is
more women representation

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:44.180
in the culinary world.

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:46.370
But again, I think we
just have to have a voice,

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:48.920
and we have to
continue to do speaking

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:54.050
panels and things like this, and
join together and be visible.

00:03:57.320 --> 00:03:59.060
And that goes for
all parts of me.

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:00.170
I'm a woman of color.

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:01.680
I'm a female.

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:04.710
I'm part of the LGBTQ community.

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:07.880
I have all these sort
of minority categories

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:09.440
that I'm representing.

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:15.770
And yeah, I'm a chef,
but I think it gives me--

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:18.980
kind of puts me on
this level where

00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:27.150
I can represent those
categories and be proud of that.

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:28.742
SPEAKER: That's great.

00:04:28.742 --> 00:04:29.700
MELISSA KING: I ramble.

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:30.533
SPEAKER: No, no, no.

00:04:30.533 --> 00:04:31.730
That's a great long answer.

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:32.990
I loved it.

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:37.746
So then from that, how did
you get on to "Top Chef"?

00:04:37.746 --> 00:04:39.620
MELISSA KING: Man, I
was always like, oh, I'm

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:41.840
never going to apply
for one of these shows.

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:44.390
I don't want to do
competition television.

00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:45.800
I just want to cook.

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:47.990
And many, many years
I was against it.

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:49.850
And I had friends and
family that are like,

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:50.870
you need to apply.

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:52.430
Like just try.

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:56.760
And so I think one of my friends
filled out an application,

00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:57.907
and they put it on my desk.

00:04:57.907 --> 00:04:59.490
They're like, you're
filling this out.

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:02.190
And it's like a
30-page application

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:03.830
to apply for "Top Chef."

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:06.440
and I was like, all right,
let's give it a try.

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:09.285
But it took me maybe two
years to actually complete

00:05:09.285 --> 00:05:12.780
it and have the guts
to just submit it.

00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:17.280
But then I turned it in,
and I didn't get a call back

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:18.930
for another two years.

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:22.100
And I just thought,
OK, at least I tried.

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:24.930
And I give myself
props for that.

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:26.910
And then they called
a few years later.

00:05:26.910 --> 00:05:29.610
And I had to go through
the whole process again.

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:32.400
And it's like a three-month
back to back interviews.

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:35.850
And they're flying to LA and
you're interviewing there.

00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:39.390
And next thing you know,
I was packing up my knives

00:05:39.390 --> 00:05:40.730
and heading to Boston.

00:05:40.730 --> 00:05:44.070
Like within a week, they tell
you, OK, you're on "Top Chef."

00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:46.450
We're flying you out next week.

00:05:46.450 --> 00:05:48.825
So it was an
incredible experience.

00:05:48.825 --> 00:05:50.700
SPEAKER: Did you just
have to drop a lot just

00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:51.720
to get out there and do it?

00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:52.630
MELISSA KING: You do.

00:05:52.630 --> 00:05:53.130
Yeah.

00:05:53.130 --> 00:05:54.880
And I think it's one
of those things where

00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:56.670
you have that opportunity.

00:05:56.670 --> 00:06:01.350
And if you're going to go
for it, and they say yes,

00:06:01.350 --> 00:06:04.420
you can't say no and just
back out all of a sudden.

00:06:04.420 --> 00:06:08.790
So I was all right, let's do
it and see where this goes.

00:06:08.790 --> 00:06:10.490
And I'll just try my best.

00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:15.320
And yeah, it went well.

00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:17.340
SPEAKER: So after
that, what doors

00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:21.120
did that open with
that kind of coverage?

00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:24.600
MELISSA KING: You know, it's
incredible what it can for--

00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:26.210
if you really just--

00:06:26.210 --> 00:06:28.611
I think a lot of people,
some come off the show

00:06:28.611 --> 00:06:30.610
and then they just go
back to their normal jobs.

00:06:30.610 --> 00:06:36.930
But it really does open
up a lot of opportunities.

00:06:36.930 --> 00:06:42.217
Like right now I'm working with
companies like Humphrey Slocum.

00:06:42.217 --> 00:06:43.800
You'll get to try
the ice cream later.

00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:50.160
I actually did an event
yesterday with Williams-Sonoma,

00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:52.720
and I'm a chef ambassador
for Whole Foods Market.

00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:55.109
So like all these
other companies come

00:06:55.109 --> 00:06:57.400
and they're like, hey, we
want to collaborate with you.

00:06:57.400 --> 00:07:00.270
And that's, I think,
where my strengths lie

00:07:00.270 --> 00:07:04.200
and where I want to be able
to work with these companies

00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:06.150
to create something fun.

00:07:06.150 --> 00:07:07.160
Even Google.

00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:12.630
Hey, let's do something cool
here and make something.

00:07:12.630 --> 00:07:16.980
So yeah, it definitely changes
your life, the whole "Top Chef"

00:07:16.980 --> 00:07:19.830
experience, or can change
your life if you really

00:07:19.830 --> 00:07:22.120
take advantage of it.

00:07:22.120 --> 00:07:24.570
SPEAKER: When we talked
about this earlier,

00:07:24.570 --> 00:07:28.670
you did mention that you
cook for some celebrities.

00:07:28.670 --> 00:07:31.484
I'm just curious, when
you cook for celebrities,

00:07:31.484 --> 00:07:33.150
do they want you to
cook stuff that they

00:07:33.150 --> 00:07:34.710
saw you cook on "Top Chef"?

00:07:34.710 --> 00:07:38.306
Or do they just tell you to go
wild and do whatever you want?

00:07:38.306 --> 00:07:40.180
MELISSA KING: Usually
you just go wild, yeah,

00:07:40.180 --> 00:07:42.150
do what you want.

00:07:42.150 --> 00:07:44.940
It all came up because we were
in that-- what room was that?

00:07:44.940 --> 00:07:46.481
SPEAKER: Broom
closet, the Speakeasy.

00:07:46.481 --> 00:07:48.390
MELISSA KING: We were
in the broom closet.

00:07:48.390 --> 00:07:50.250
Awesome room.

00:07:50.250 --> 00:07:53.947
And he said that Al Gore
was here and did a talk.

00:07:53.947 --> 00:07:55.030
SPEAKER: He did something.

00:07:55.030 --> 00:07:55.860
MELISSA KING: He
did something and he

00:07:55.860 --> 00:07:57.068
was hanging out in that room.

00:07:57.068 --> 00:07:59.550
And I was like, oh, I
cooked for him before.

00:07:59.550 --> 00:08:03.030
After "Top Chef" he, I
guess, had watched the show,

00:08:03.030 --> 00:08:05.800
and it was like hey, I
want you to cook for me.

00:08:05.800 --> 00:08:06.540
And he's a vegan.

00:08:06.540 --> 00:08:10.200
And he let me do whatever
I wanted within those vegan

00:08:10.200 --> 00:08:11.130
parameters.

00:08:11.130 --> 00:08:15.030
And so I just did like a whole
10-course vegan tasting menu

00:08:15.030 --> 00:08:17.760
for him and his friends.

00:08:17.760 --> 00:08:19.920
So yeah, it's pretty cool.

00:08:19.920 --> 00:08:22.050
They usually give
you a lot of freedom,

00:08:22.050 --> 00:08:24.690
but within their
dietary restrictions.

00:08:24.690 --> 00:08:27.390
SPEAKER: So with your
Co+Lab that you're doing,

00:08:27.390 --> 00:08:30.421
which you maybe have to explain
to some of us what the Co+Lab

00:08:30.421 --> 00:08:30.920
does.

00:08:30.920 --> 00:08:33.600
But does that fit into this
freedom that you have as well?

00:08:33.600 --> 00:08:34.391
MELISSA KING: Yeah.

00:08:34.391 --> 00:08:36.289
Well, Co+Lab started
right after "Top Chef."

00:08:36.289 --> 00:08:38.005
I was like, I want
to just feed people

00:08:38.005 --> 00:08:40.409
and I want to do a cool dinner.

00:08:40.409 --> 00:08:45.720
And so I came up with Co+Lab,
where I was collaborating with

00:08:45.720 --> 00:08:52.140
other chefs in the city, and
also local artists and artisans

00:08:52.140 --> 00:08:53.640
within the city, and products.

00:08:53.640 --> 00:08:55.350
So we would take
those products--

00:08:55.350 --> 00:08:57.210
for instance, we
had Philz Coffee,

00:08:57.210 --> 00:09:01.140
we had Bellwether
Ricotta Cheese,

00:09:01.140 --> 00:09:03.700
and we were just sourcing
from different purveyors

00:09:03.700 --> 00:09:06.330
and really highlighting
those ingredients

00:09:06.330 --> 00:09:10.360
within each course of the menu.

00:09:10.360 --> 00:09:13.500
And so I was able to
take Co+Lab down to LA,

00:09:13.500 --> 00:09:17.880
and I did dinner with
all the female "Top Chef"

00:09:17.880 --> 00:09:19.920
finalists and winners.

00:09:19.920 --> 00:09:25.170
So we had Mei Lin, we had Brooke
Williamson, Nyesha Arrington,

00:09:25.170 --> 00:09:26.910
and Shirley Chung.

00:09:26.910 --> 00:09:28.590
And that was an
awesome dinner where

00:09:28.590 --> 00:09:32.670
we collaborated and came up
with this really fun menu

00:09:32.670 --> 00:09:35.550
using local LA products.

00:09:35.550 --> 00:09:38.250
And part of the proceeds
went to La Casina,

00:09:38.250 --> 00:09:41.730
which is a women-run
organization up

00:09:41.730 --> 00:09:44.670
in San Francisco.

00:09:44.670 --> 00:09:46.710
So it was just great.

00:09:46.710 --> 00:09:52.350
It was an opportunity for me to
be able to be creative and host

00:09:52.350 --> 00:09:54.420
dinners in different areas.

00:09:54.420 --> 00:09:57.090
SPEAKER: And you partner with--
it seems like you just have

00:09:57.090 --> 00:09:59.700
friends everywhere, and
you'll partner with just--

00:09:59.700 --> 00:10:01.450
you'll find a reason
to partner with them,

00:10:01.450 --> 00:10:03.330
like, I'm doing this.

00:10:03.330 --> 00:10:04.950
You make tables.

00:10:04.950 --> 00:10:05.970
Come and--

00:10:05.970 --> 00:10:08.170
MELISSA KING: Yeah.

00:10:08.170 --> 00:10:10.317
For me, like I had a
friend that makes ceramics.

00:10:10.317 --> 00:10:11.900
And I'm like, hey,
do you want to make

00:10:11.900 --> 00:10:14.680
ceramics for my
pop-up dinner and make

00:10:14.680 --> 00:10:18.340
it specific to that course?

00:10:18.340 --> 00:10:20.200
So I think it's
just about community

00:10:20.200 --> 00:10:26.050
and really working together to
put on a really amazing dinner

00:10:26.050 --> 00:10:28.900
that you walk away
just feeling wow,

00:10:28.900 --> 00:10:33.130
there was so much thought
put into every detail.

00:10:33.130 --> 00:10:35.950
That's what Co+Lab was about.

00:10:35.950 --> 00:10:39.040
SPEAKER: How'd that
turn into being

00:10:39.040 --> 00:10:42.930
an ambassador at Whole Foods
and also creating your own ice

00:10:42.930 --> 00:10:43.810
cream?

00:10:43.810 --> 00:10:44.920
MELISSA KING: Yeah.

00:10:44.920 --> 00:10:47.755
The Whole Foods thing came up.

00:10:47.755 --> 00:10:50.860
I just kind of formed a
relationship with the company,

00:10:50.860 --> 00:10:52.960
and next thing you
know I was creating

00:10:52.960 --> 00:10:54.880
products for their hot bar.

00:10:54.880 --> 00:10:57.820
And we were thinking,
how can we keep

00:10:57.820 --> 00:11:03.410
making things interesting
within the market place?

00:11:03.410 --> 00:11:06.179
So I was like, why don't
we make an ice cream?

00:11:06.179 --> 00:11:07.720
So we reached out
to Humphrey Slocum,

00:11:07.720 --> 00:11:10.210
which was one of my favorites
because they come up

00:11:10.210 --> 00:11:13.450
with crazy flavor profiles.

00:11:13.450 --> 00:11:17.020
And next thing you
know, all three of us

00:11:17.020 --> 00:11:21.050
just started brainstorming, how
can we make a fun of ice cream?

00:11:21.050 --> 00:11:23.800
So we came up with
Hong Kong Milk Tea ice

00:11:23.800 --> 00:11:27.760
cream, which was inspired
by my childhood and just

00:11:27.760 --> 00:11:29.770
my cultural background.

00:11:29.770 --> 00:11:32.860
My family's from Hong Kong,
and we drank Hong Kong milk tea

00:11:32.860 --> 00:11:33.880
all the time.

00:11:33.880 --> 00:11:35.740
For those of you that
don't know what it is,

00:11:35.740 --> 00:11:40.330
it's a black tea that you
brew really, really strong.

00:11:40.330 --> 00:11:42.520
And you mix condensed
milk in there.

00:11:42.520 --> 00:11:45.310
And sometimes people put
a little evaporated milk

00:11:45.310 --> 00:11:46.560
or sugar.

00:11:46.560 --> 00:11:53.560
But it's kind of creamy, has
a lot of tannins from the tea.

00:11:53.560 --> 00:11:57.910
And we turned that into an ice
cream base with Strauss milk.

00:11:57.910 --> 00:12:01.120
And then we're like,
OK, this needs texture.

00:12:01.120 --> 00:12:05.740
So we decided to make almond
cookies and folded that in.

00:12:05.740 --> 00:12:07.510
So you'll get to
try that in a bit.

00:12:07.510 --> 00:12:12.262
But it's kind of this play on
tea and shortbread cookies.

00:12:12.262 --> 00:12:13.720
SPEAKER: So you
got the inspiration

00:12:13.720 --> 00:12:15.520
from growing up with that.

00:12:15.520 --> 00:12:17.950
Where else do you
draw inspiration

00:12:17.950 --> 00:12:21.880
from with all these pop-ups?

00:12:21.880 --> 00:12:25.540
MELISSA KING: I
think a lot of it

00:12:25.540 --> 00:12:29.860
actually comes from my childhood
or just places I've traveled.

00:12:29.860 --> 00:12:34.090
I traveled a lot when I was
young, and throughout my 20s

00:12:34.090 --> 00:12:43.402
I backpacked Asia a few times,
and Europe in between jobs.

00:12:43.402 --> 00:12:44.860
Yeah, I think just
from there, just

00:12:44.860 --> 00:12:47.980
being able to explore and
taste all these unique flavors

00:12:47.980 --> 00:12:51.070
from other areas of the world.

00:12:51.070 --> 00:12:53.080
And I'm like, how can
I bring those flavors

00:12:53.080 --> 00:12:58.340
here into the form of
the cooking that I do?

00:12:58.340 --> 00:13:01.930
And so that's kind of, I
guess, where my inspiration

00:13:01.930 --> 00:13:02.530
comes from.

00:13:02.530 --> 00:13:05.010
But also nature
is a big one, too.

00:13:05.010 --> 00:13:06.350
I like to be outdoors.

00:13:06.350 --> 00:13:10.720
And I think that comes in
my plating style sometimes.

00:13:10.720 --> 00:13:14.830
When you see some of my dishes,
or more my fine dining dishes

00:13:14.830 --> 00:13:19.530
are inspired by nature
and gardens and stuff.

00:13:19.530 --> 00:13:21.710
Try to make it look
organic, you know?

00:13:21.710 --> 00:13:24.130
SPEAKER: Do you try to keep
it very localized ideas

00:13:24.130 --> 00:13:25.330
with the plating and that?

00:13:25.330 --> 00:13:26.430
MELISSA KING: Absolutely.

00:13:26.430 --> 00:13:26.930
Yeah.

00:13:26.930 --> 00:13:31.240
I'm always in my
backyard foraging,

00:13:31.240 --> 00:13:35.200
always trying to get to
know friends that hunt

00:13:35.200 --> 00:13:39.190
and fish because I think it's
important to support that.

00:13:39.190 --> 00:13:44.090
And for me it's
about the quality.

00:13:44.090 --> 00:13:46.240
You can taste the quality
of the ingredients

00:13:46.240 --> 00:13:49.720
when you're getting it straight
from the source versus having

00:13:49.720 --> 00:13:54.910
it travel miles to get to you.

00:13:54.910 --> 00:13:58.300
So yeah, I think
for me, I really

00:13:58.300 --> 00:14:01.262
try to support local
as much as possible.

00:14:01.262 --> 00:14:03.220
And you know, these people
are working so hard.

00:14:03.220 --> 00:14:05.490
A lot of these small
mom and pop businesses,

00:14:05.490 --> 00:14:07.570
they're working so
hard, and I want

00:14:07.570 --> 00:14:11.020
to support that rather
than the man sometimes.

00:14:14.280 --> 00:14:18.230
SPEAKER: With all that
you're doing now, how big

00:14:18.230 --> 00:14:21.350
is your social media presence?

00:14:21.350 --> 00:14:24.552
Do you have somebody
else taking care of that,

00:14:24.552 --> 00:14:25.510
or how important is it?

00:14:25.510 --> 00:14:27.480
MELISSA KING: No, I do my own.

00:14:27.480 --> 00:14:29.550
It's more authentic that way.

00:14:29.550 --> 00:14:31.470
And I like to share
what I'm doing.

00:14:34.220 --> 00:14:38.100
I think I was downstairs taking
a picture of the Google sign,

00:14:38.100 --> 00:14:39.720
saying, I'm here.

00:14:39.720 --> 00:14:42.490
So yeah, I definitely
run my own accounts.

00:14:42.490 --> 00:14:45.660
And I think it's important
to just connect to people.

00:14:45.660 --> 00:14:50.910
But yes, social media does
play a very big role these days

00:14:50.910 --> 00:14:54.640
in your brand and
the exposure of that.

00:14:54.640 --> 00:14:58.090
And when I was hosting my
first Co+Lab, I was like,

00:14:58.090 --> 00:14:59.770
how am I going to
sell tickets to this?

00:14:59.770 --> 00:15:04.350
So I just started blasting it
on Instagram, and it works.

00:15:04.350 --> 00:15:06.417
It's really amazing,
the power of it.

00:15:06.417 --> 00:15:08.250
SPEAKER: So how do we
find you on Instagram?

00:15:08.250 --> 00:15:09.590
Do we just search your name?

00:15:09.590 --> 00:15:12.530
MELISSA KING: Yeah,
just Chef Melissa King.

00:15:12.530 --> 00:15:15.240
I think all my handles
are @ChefMelissaKing,

00:15:15.240 --> 00:15:17.320
or ChefMelissaKing.com.

00:15:17.320 --> 00:15:19.070
You can actually email
me straightforward.

00:15:19.070 --> 00:15:21.990
It goes right to me, and I think
that's how you guys found me.

00:15:26.510 --> 00:15:29.970
So if you do enough
stalking, you can find me.

00:15:29.970 --> 00:15:32.590
SPEAKER: Follow me around the
city to find your Co+Labs.

00:15:32.590 --> 00:15:35.630
MELISSA KING: Yeah,
show up at my house.

00:15:35.630 --> 00:15:38.220
SPEAKER: What advice
can you give those

00:15:38.220 --> 00:15:40.650
who are aspiring to be a chef?

00:15:43.285 --> 00:15:44.910
MELISSA KING: You
know, if you've never

00:15:44.910 --> 00:15:46.770
cooked in a
professional kitchen,

00:15:46.770 --> 00:15:48.510
make sure you do
that first before you

00:15:48.510 --> 00:15:50.400
go to culinary school.

00:15:50.400 --> 00:15:53.120
A lot of people come out,
they watch things on TV

00:15:53.120 --> 00:15:54.870
and they're like, oh,
I want to be a chef.

00:15:54.870 --> 00:15:56.520
That must be fun.

00:15:56.520 --> 00:15:57.160
And it is.

00:15:57.160 --> 00:16:00.720
It's a lot of fun, but at the
same time it's so much work.

00:16:00.720 --> 00:16:04.710
And it's not an easy life.

00:16:04.710 --> 00:16:07.110
And I think do your research.

00:16:07.110 --> 00:16:10.020
Make sure you go get an
internship at a restaurant,

00:16:10.020 --> 00:16:12.260
and really just get your--

00:16:12.260 --> 00:16:14.520
work there for free if
you have to because that's

00:16:14.520 --> 00:16:16.710
how my industry works.

00:16:16.710 --> 00:16:19.800
And dedicate that
time to really see

00:16:19.800 --> 00:16:21.570
if this is something
you want to dedicate

00:16:21.570 --> 00:16:24.390
your life to because,
again, you're working

00:16:24.390 --> 00:16:27.030
every weekend, every holiday.

00:16:27.030 --> 00:16:30.300
You can't go home
and feed your kids.

00:16:30.300 --> 00:16:32.730
It's tough to
balance that, having

00:16:32.730 --> 00:16:36.120
a family and your career.

00:16:36.120 --> 00:16:39.030
And I'm sure that applies
to a lot of industries,

00:16:39.030 --> 00:16:42.930
just having to balance it all.

00:16:42.930 --> 00:16:44.930
SPEAKER: Some days you
just go into work feeling

00:16:44.930 --> 00:16:46.440
like it's going
to be a war zone.

00:16:46.440 --> 00:16:49.080
MELISSA KING: It's a war
zone every day in a kitchen.

00:16:49.080 --> 00:16:50.640
I can guarantee you that one.

00:16:50.640 --> 00:16:53.850
Something always goes wrong.

00:16:53.850 --> 00:16:57.641
SPEAKER: Well, I don't think
I have any more questions,

00:16:57.641 --> 00:16:58.140
actually.

00:16:58.140 --> 00:16:59.765
But we do have a lot
of people here who

00:16:59.765 --> 00:17:01.129
I know have lots of questions.

00:17:01.129 --> 00:17:02.170
Let me grab a microphone.

00:17:02.170 --> 00:17:03.360
MELISSA KING: Yeah.

00:17:03.360 --> 00:17:06.319
Shoot away.

00:17:06.319 --> 00:17:07.220
Any questions.

00:17:07.220 --> 00:17:08.839
All right, there.

00:17:08.839 --> 00:17:09.630
AUDIENCE: Hi there.

00:17:09.630 --> 00:17:10.410
Thanks for coming.

00:17:10.410 --> 00:17:14.430
What's your favorite
restaurant in San Francisco?

00:17:14.430 --> 00:17:17.099
MELISSA KING: That's
a hard question.

00:17:17.099 --> 00:17:19.650
There's a lot that I frequent.

00:17:19.650 --> 00:17:23.250
I think it depends on what
type of food I'm looking for.

00:17:23.250 --> 00:17:26.849
But I feel like I
go to Rintaro a lot.

00:17:26.849 --> 00:17:31.860
It's a Japanese izakaya over
by Rainbow Grocery Store

00:17:31.860 --> 00:17:33.120
in the Mission.

00:17:33.120 --> 00:17:34.800
That one's great.

00:17:34.800 --> 00:17:36.940
I flew to Japan a lot
last year because I

00:17:36.940 --> 00:17:40.740
was opening a restaurant project
called El Cafe out there.

00:17:40.740 --> 00:17:43.260
And when I go eat
at Rintaro, it just

00:17:43.260 --> 00:17:48.060
reminds me of really homey
Japanese comfort foods.

00:17:48.060 --> 00:17:52.170
It's like homemade
udon and katsu.

00:17:52.170 --> 00:17:56.600
Nothing too fancy, but
they do a great job there.

00:17:56.600 --> 00:17:57.810
Couple other places.

00:17:57.810 --> 00:17:59.820
I've been really
into RT Rotisserie.

00:17:59.820 --> 00:18:01.470
Have you guys been there?

00:18:01.470 --> 00:18:03.750
It's a fun, simple
spot, but they just

00:18:03.750 --> 00:18:05.580
do a really awesome
roast chicken

00:18:05.580 --> 00:18:10.800
with Douglas Fir yogurt sauce
and different dipping sauces.

00:18:10.800 --> 00:18:14.835
And they do these umami
fries that are amazing.

00:18:14.835 --> 00:18:17.824
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
what was it called?

00:18:17.824 --> 00:18:18.990
MELISSA KING: RT Rotisserie.

00:18:18.990 --> 00:18:22.530
It's from the people
that did Rich Table,

00:18:22.530 --> 00:18:25.290
and it's their more
fast casual concept.

00:18:25.290 --> 00:18:26.940
But I think San
Francisco, that's

00:18:26.940 --> 00:18:28.470
kind of what we're
moving towards,

00:18:28.470 --> 00:18:33.180
is what can we eat
that's done well, made

00:18:33.180 --> 00:18:36.400
with good ingredients,
and is quick,

00:18:36.400 --> 00:18:38.340
and that we can sit
there and still get

00:18:38.340 --> 00:18:41.760
a beer or a glass of wine?

00:18:41.760 --> 00:18:43.830
So you see RT
Rotisserie popping up,

00:18:43.830 --> 00:18:47.790
and places like Souvla where
it's really quick to just get

00:18:47.790 --> 00:18:48.330
in and out.

00:18:52.252 --> 00:18:53.710
SPEAKER: I'm going
to sneak across.

00:18:55.702 --> 00:18:57.160
AUDIENCE: I'm
curious your thoughts

00:18:57.160 --> 00:19:00.820
on the sort of upswell of
fast casual restaurants.

00:19:00.820 --> 00:19:06.352
There's a lot of
art to fine dining.

00:19:06.352 --> 00:19:08.560
And I think we certainly
see some art in fast casual.

00:19:08.560 --> 00:19:09.940
But I'm curious your
thoughts on this.

00:19:09.940 --> 00:19:11.512
We definitely see
it in San Francisco

00:19:11.512 --> 00:19:12.970
and I'd love to
hear more from you.

00:19:12.970 --> 00:19:14.120
MELISSA KING: Absolutely.

00:19:14.120 --> 00:19:15.940
Yeah, you know, part
of me is a little sad

00:19:15.940 --> 00:19:19.120
that fine dining is
dying because that

00:19:19.120 --> 00:19:21.370
was where I came
from and the kitchens

00:19:21.370 --> 00:19:22.590
that I've been bred through.

00:19:25.210 --> 00:19:27.040
Yeah, it is an
art, like you said.

00:19:27.040 --> 00:19:31.540
And I think right
now, definitely times

00:19:31.540 --> 00:19:33.940
are changing because
people want convenience

00:19:33.940 --> 00:19:36.660
and they want affordability.

00:19:36.660 --> 00:19:39.340
But I think there's a way to
bridge that and still make

00:19:39.340 --> 00:19:44.800
that food elevated and
delicious and technique-driven

00:19:44.800 --> 00:19:49.550
without having to cost a lot for
the owner and for the customer

00:19:49.550 --> 00:19:51.410
as well.

00:19:51.410 --> 00:19:53.020
But yeah, I do think--

00:19:53.020 --> 00:19:55.880
a little part of me is sad.

00:20:04.237 --> 00:20:06.320
AUDIENCE: He laughs as he
hands me the microphone.

00:20:06.320 --> 00:20:08.540
So my question is
actually kind of random.

00:20:08.540 --> 00:20:10.880
After "Top Chef,"
people obviously

00:20:10.880 --> 00:20:14.660
started recognizing you and
following you on social media.

00:20:14.660 --> 00:20:21.560
Were you involved with social
media before as a normal Person

00:20:21.560 --> 00:20:23.510
MELISSA KING: I
definitely had Instagram.

00:20:23.510 --> 00:20:26.150
AUDIENCE: How did that
change for you after,

00:20:26.150 --> 00:20:28.280
when you realized
like, oh, weird.

00:20:28.280 --> 00:20:30.590
Now there's all these
people who think that they

00:20:30.590 --> 00:20:32.695
know me and are following me.

00:20:32.695 --> 00:20:34.760
And now I'm sending
a message and I'm

00:20:34.760 --> 00:20:37.130
representing all these things.

00:20:37.130 --> 00:20:40.310
Did you feel you needed
to post different content

00:20:40.310 --> 00:20:43.779
or curate it more or anything?

00:20:43.779 --> 00:20:44.570
MELISSA KING: Yeah.

00:20:44.570 --> 00:20:46.160
I definitely think--

00:20:46.160 --> 00:20:49.970
I had Instagram before
and only had, maybe,

00:20:49.970 --> 00:20:52.420
like 100 followers,
or just my friends.

00:20:52.420 --> 00:20:56.390
And then overnight
it really does change

00:20:56.390 --> 00:20:59.570
when you go on a TV show.

00:20:59.570 --> 00:21:02.120
Suddenly you're getting
like 100 followers a day.

00:21:02.120 --> 00:21:06.500
And I think from there,
I started realizing, oh,

00:21:06.500 --> 00:21:10.780
what I'm putting out
there people are really

00:21:10.780 --> 00:21:11.780
taking serious.

00:21:11.780 --> 00:21:15.680
And I have to either be sure
I'm censoring certain things,

00:21:15.680 --> 00:21:18.760
or kind of curate
it a little more.

00:21:18.760 --> 00:21:22.040
So yeah, I think just being
aware of what I'm putting out

00:21:22.040 --> 00:21:24.470
there and the message
that's coming across

00:21:24.470 --> 00:21:27.800
is something that
I constantly am,

00:21:27.800 --> 00:21:30.756
what do I Instagram today,
because it's a lot of pressure,

00:21:30.756 --> 00:21:32.090
you know?

00:21:32.090 --> 00:21:36.115
But it's become a full time job
sometimes to keep up with that.

00:21:36.115 --> 00:21:36.740
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:21:36.740 --> 00:21:40.010
I asked because a couple
weeks or months ago, I

00:21:40.010 --> 00:21:43.130
was involved in a
Women in and Twitter--

00:21:43.130 --> 00:21:45.280
I wrote a Tweet
and had the hashtag

00:21:45.280 --> 00:21:47.780
that was part of this
Women and Tech movement.

00:21:47.780 --> 00:21:51.590
And mine became the top
Tweet of the movement,

00:21:51.590 --> 00:21:55.440
which became the top tag on
Twitter for an entire weekend.

00:21:55.440 --> 00:21:57.050
And so I went through
this experience

00:21:57.050 --> 00:21:58.850
where all of a sudden
my phone was just

00:21:58.850 --> 00:22:00.500
constant notifications.

00:22:00.500 --> 00:22:02.870
The Tweet got over
a million hits.

00:22:02.870 --> 00:22:04.520
Like actually, M as in million.

00:22:04.520 --> 00:22:07.760
And I was like, I am
just a software engineer.

00:22:07.760 --> 00:22:10.190
And then I had this
paralysis every time

00:22:10.190 --> 00:22:12.080
I went to post something.

00:22:12.080 --> 00:22:15.170
It was like, they're expecting
something from me now.

00:22:15.170 --> 00:22:17.189
And I'm just a girl who
had a really good crepe

00:22:17.189 --> 00:22:18.980
and I just wanted to
share a picture of it.

00:22:18.980 --> 00:22:20.313
MELISSA KING: Usually I do that.

00:22:20.313 --> 00:22:22.640
Yeah, usually I'm like, I
just ate this amazing meal

00:22:22.640 --> 00:22:24.320
and I want to share
it with the world.

00:22:24.320 --> 00:22:25.850
But then there's
also other messages

00:22:25.850 --> 00:22:29.780
that I want to explain
to people, where

00:22:29.780 --> 00:22:33.630
if I'm involved in a pride
parade for the LGBT community,

00:22:33.630 --> 00:22:38.030
I want to share that
and continue to spread

00:22:38.030 --> 00:22:40.250
that voice as much as I can.

00:22:40.250 --> 00:22:43.040
So yeah, I think there
are parts of my brain

00:22:43.040 --> 00:22:46.970
that are, OK, is
this OK to post?

00:22:46.970 --> 00:22:48.920
Is it OK to just
post my sandwich

00:22:48.920 --> 00:22:52.580
that I just had at Google?

00:22:52.580 --> 00:22:55.180
Is anyone going to care?

00:22:55.180 --> 00:22:57.984
But yeah, it's fun.

00:22:57.984 --> 00:22:59.900
AUDIENCE: I just wanted
to ask, so as a woman,

00:22:59.900 --> 00:23:02.030
do you feel like that
has held you back,

00:23:02.030 --> 00:23:06.095
or that's held you from
succeeding in your life,

00:23:06.095 --> 00:23:09.660
and there was a pivotal moment
in the culinary industry?

00:23:09.660 --> 00:23:11.540
I guess I should
be more specific.

00:23:11.540 --> 00:23:13.550
MELISSA KING: I don't
think it's held me back.

00:23:13.550 --> 00:23:18.140
But I have had
experiences in kitchens

00:23:18.140 --> 00:23:21.080
where I was treated different.

00:23:21.080 --> 00:23:27.910
You know, I was working in a
place where one of my chefs

00:23:27.910 --> 00:23:31.160
is a very traditional
Japanese guy from Japan.

00:23:31.160 --> 00:23:34.400
And I think the
experience was like, oh,

00:23:34.400 --> 00:23:37.890
are you sure you want to
do this with your life?

00:23:37.890 --> 00:23:40.940
And I was like,
what do you mean?

00:23:40.940 --> 00:23:42.260
I'm just like the other guys.

00:23:42.260 --> 00:23:44.720
And he's like, well,
I mean cooking.

00:23:44.720 --> 00:23:46.970
Like you can't have a family.

00:23:46.970 --> 00:23:48.740
And he was questioning me.

00:23:48.740 --> 00:23:52.070
And I was like,
well, I don't think

00:23:52.070 --> 00:23:55.580
that you have to
completely sacrifice that.

00:23:55.580 --> 00:23:58.640
Of course, you can make
compromises and accommodations

00:23:58.640 --> 00:24:00.260
with your partner.

00:24:00.260 --> 00:24:03.762
But I think he just felt--

00:24:03.762 --> 00:24:05.720
I don't know, somehow I
was treated differently

00:24:05.720 --> 00:24:07.880
in that scenario
for being a woman.

00:24:07.880 --> 00:24:10.052
He wouldn't have asked
the men that question.

00:24:10.052 --> 00:24:11.510
Are you sure you
want to be a chef?

00:24:11.510 --> 00:24:12.468
What about your family?

00:24:15.620 --> 00:24:19.190
So I guess we
always constantly--

00:24:19.190 --> 00:24:23.690
people will approach us
with questions like that.

00:24:23.690 --> 00:24:26.280
But it's good to think about it.

00:24:26.280 --> 00:24:28.760
But I still think it doesn't
matter what your gender is.

00:24:28.760 --> 00:24:32.360
And if you are good
at what you're doing

00:24:32.360 --> 00:24:36.380
and you're dedicated,
then you will succeed.

00:24:39.820 --> 00:24:43.790
And a lot of it, again, is just
joining together and continuing

00:24:43.790 --> 00:24:46.190
to participate in
speaking panels,

00:24:46.190 --> 00:24:53.540
or continuing to spread that
voice for the female community.

00:24:53.540 --> 00:24:54.040
Yeah.

00:25:00.910 --> 00:25:02.520
SPEAKER: Do we have
any more questions

00:25:02.520 --> 00:25:05.165
before we have some ice cream?

00:25:05.165 --> 00:25:05.664
Nope?

00:25:05.664 --> 00:25:06.600
We got one right here.

00:25:06.600 --> 00:25:07.560
Of course you may.

00:25:07.560 --> 00:25:08.810
AUDIENCE: I mean, you're here.

00:25:08.810 --> 00:25:10.690
I'd love to take
advantage of this.

00:25:10.690 --> 00:25:13.467
So you're working
with Whole Foods,

00:25:13.467 --> 00:25:15.300
and now you're working
with Humphrey Slocum,

00:25:15.300 --> 00:25:17.754
and that's such a great
partnership or tri-ship.

00:25:17.754 --> 00:25:19.920
I don't know what you would
call the three together.

00:25:19.920 --> 00:25:23.284
What are you next
most excited about?

00:25:23.284 --> 00:25:25.200
MELISSA KING: I definitely
have a few projects

00:25:25.200 --> 00:25:27.780
that I've been working
on that I can't tell you

00:25:27.780 --> 00:25:30.150
right now what's going on.

00:25:30.150 --> 00:25:33.720
But I will be back
to tell you more.

00:25:33.720 --> 00:25:40.050
But hopefully it's something big
and exciting that you'll see.

00:25:40.050 --> 00:25:43.710
It's definitely
restaurant-focused.

00:25:43.710 --> 00:25:48.090
And also I have so many things
on my list that I want to do.

00:25:48.090 --> 00:25:50.880
And it's like, OK, which one
am I going to knock off first?

00:25:50.880 --> 00:25:54.150
And just focusing
towards restaurant,

00:25:54.150 --> 00:25:58.030
check, cookbook, check,
those sort of things.

00:25:58.030 --> 00:25:59.640
So there's definitely a few.

00:25:59.640 --> 00:26:02.610
But within my
current schedule, I

00:26:02.610 --> 00:26:06.570
have a few events that
I'll be participating in.

00:26:06.570 --> 00:26:08.820
One is called Girl Venture.

00:26:08.820 --> 00:26:11.670
And it's a organization
here in the Mission

00:26:11.670 --> 00:26:13.110
at the Women's Center.

00:26:13.110 --> 00:26:20.730
And they support women,
the youth community,

00:26:20.730 --> 00:26:23.040
just to help empower them.

00:26:23.040 --> 00:26:25.766
They go rock climbing,
they go kayaking,

00:26:25.766 --> 00:26:27.390
and they do a lot of
outdoor activities

00:26:27.390 --> 00:26:33.210
to help these young girls
really feel supported.

00:26:33.210 --> 00:26:38.790
So I'm going to be hosting their
gala dinner on September 21.

00:26:38.790 --> 00:26:40.910
I think we still have
tickets available

00:26:40.910 --> 00:26:43.310
if anybody wants to come.

00:26:43.310 --> 00:26:46.350
And I'll be at the Newport
Beach Wine and Food Festival

00:26:46.350 --> 00:26:47.660
at the end of the month.

00:26:47.660 --> 00:26:49.560
And a couple other
Top Chefers are there.

00:26:49.560 --> 00:26:54.900
And that'll be fun, and that
one's with Whole Foods Market.

00:26:54.900 --> 00:26:58.318
Yeah, a lot of fun
events lined up.

00:26:58.318 --> 00:26:59.950
AUDIENCE: Can I ask
one more question?

00:26:59.950 --> 00:27:02.550
It just occurred to me we're
about to try some delicious ice

00:27:02.550 --> 00:27:02.760
cream.

00:27:02.760 --> 00:27:04.134
Can you tell us
a little bit more

00:27:04.134 --> 00:27:07.530
about ice cream development,
like how many different types

00:27:07.530 --> 00:27:10.080
did you try?

00:27:10.080 --> 00:27:12.660
MELISSA KING: This
particular ice cream

00:27:12.660 --> 00:27:15.210
we figured out very
quickly, surprisingly.

00:27:15.210 --> 00:27:18.710
We went through about
four different batches

00:27:18.710 --> 00:27:22.660
and met up four different
times to do taste tests.

00:27:22.660 --> 00:27:28.800
But I basically made a
batch of tea and was,

00:27:28.800 --> 00:27:30.880
this is what it
needs to taste like.

00:27:30.880 --> 00:27:35.400
And from there, I was with
the chefs at Humphrey Slocum.

00:27:35.400 --> 00:27:38.700
His name is Jake.

00:27:38.700 --> 00:27:41.610
Jake and Sean are the
owners of Humphrey Slocum,

00:27:41.610 --> 00:27:45.030
and we kind of met up together
and were brainstorming like,

00:27:45.030 --> 00:27:47.160
OK, is this too sweet?

00:27:47.160 --> 00:27:49.920
If it is, maybe we should cut
back on the condensed milk.

00:27:49.920 --> 00:27:52.720
But we tweaked it
out really quickly.

00:27:52.720 --> 00:27:56.290
And hopefully you
guys enjoy it today.

00:27:56.290 --> 00:27:58.050
And it's sold exclusively
at Whole Foods

00:27:58.050 --> 00:28:02.620
Market in a little pint.

00:28:02.620 --> 00:28:05.715
Hopefully it will spread
down to different regions

00:28:05.715 --> 00:28:06.340
of Whole Foods.

00:28:06.340 --> 00:28:10.500
Currently it's only in the
northern California districts.

00:28:10.500 --> 00:28:11.710
AUDIENCE: Thanks for coming.

00:28:11.710 --> 00:28:14.460
Not to stand between
everyone and ice cream.

00:28:14.460 --> 00:28:16.430
So curious about "Top Chef."

00:28:16.430 --> 00:28:17.910
What were the big
things that you

00:28:17.910 --> 00:28:20.330
learned about your cooking
style, about yourself?

00:28:20.330 --> 00:28:23.340
What you learn from others there
that kind of surprised you?

00:28:23.340 --> 00:28:26.040
MELISSA KING: Yeah.

00:28:26.040 --> 00:28:29.630
I think for my cooking,
it really opened me up.

00:28:29.630 --> 00:28:31.410
I mean, it opened me
up in so many ways.

00:28:31.410 --> 00:28:34.980
As a person, I was very shy.

00:28:34.980 --> 00:28:37.930
There's no way I would
do something like this.

00:28:37.930 --> 00:28:41.700
I can't even give a wedding
speech at my sister's wedding.

00:28:41.700 --> 00:28:43.440
But I was just very shy.

00:28:43.440 --> 00:28:49.170
And definitely opened up my
confidence in my cooking,

00:28:49.170 --> 00:28:53.190
in me as a person,
and also in just

00:28:53.190 --> 00:28:55.980
where I wanted to go with
the future of my career.

00:28:55.980 --> 00:29:01.300
And so I think I
learned a lot there.

00:29:01.300 --> 00:29:05.610
It also taught me to just
be spontaneous with cooking

00:29:05.610 --> 00:29:08.370
and don't be afraid
to experiment.

00:29:08.370 --> 00:29:11.820
And a lot of the show
was just improvising

00:29:11.820 --> 00:29:13.320
because you know,
you literally have

00:29:13.320 --> 00:29:17.036
30 minutes to cook something,
so you're oh no, what am

00:29:17.036 --> 00:29:18.470
I supposed to make right now?

00:29:18.470 --> 00:29:20.302
So you're just throwing
things in a pot.

00:29:20.302 --> 00:29:23.400
And everything we
made on that show,

00:29:23.400 --> 00:29:26.100
I would say for every chef, they
would probably tell you they've

00:29:26.100 --> 00:29:29.090
never made it
before in real life.

00:29:29.090 --> 00:29:33.670
It was the first time every
time with those recipes.

00:29:33.670 --> 00:29:39.970
So definitely learning to
improvise was a big thing.

00:29:39.970 --> 00:29:43.330
And then they surprised me
with my mom on the show.

00:29:43.330 --> 00:29:46.300
And that was the most
incredible feeling.

00:29:46.300 --> 00:29:50.800
And you know, you're there and
it's so serious and stressful.

00:29:50.800 --> 00:29:53.940
And the whole time you're
just in competition mode.

00:29:53.940 --> 00:29:55.950
And then all of a sudden
your mom shows up.

00:29:55.950 --> 00:29:58.920
So I just broke down
in tears, and it really

00:29:58.920 --> 00:30:04.860
made me feel like I have
these people that support me.

00:30:04.860 --> 00:30:09.000
And when you're in
the competition,

00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:11.110
you don't feel any of that.

00:30:11.110 --> 00:30:13.670
You're so just separate.

00:30:13.670 --> 00:30:17.670
So I came home just realizing
how much I appreciate

00:30:17.670 --> 00:30:21.630
my family and my friends.

00:30:21.630 --> 00:30:23.520
AUDIENCE: And to add
to that question,

00:30:23.520 --> 00:30:25.917
obviously we only see
a sliver of what you've

00:30:25.917 --> 00:30:27.000
experienced on "Top Chef."

00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:29.970
So are there any misperceptions
from being in your shoes,

00:30:29.970 --> 00:30:34.230
being on the show versus
what you actually see on TV?

00:30:34.230 --> 00:30:37.230
MELISSA KING: There's definitely
creative editing is probably

00:30:37.230 --> 00:30:38.520
as far as I could say.

00:30:38.520 --> 00:30:41.160
But I don't know.

00:30:41.160 --> 00:30:43.690
I've seen every
episode, and I felt

00:30:43.690 --> 00:30:48.120
it was very true to
everyone's characters.

00:30:48.120 --> 00:30:53.610
It might be a little
dramatized on certain episodes.

00:30:53.610 --> 00:30:59.340
But yeah, imagine you're filming
every day, 16 hours a day,

00:30:59.340 --> 00:31:00.930
maybe 18.

00:31:00.930 --> 00:31:04.410
And you're only seeing
about 45 minutes of that.

00:31:04.410 --> 00:31:06.960
So it's all condensed in there.

00:31:06.960 --> 00:31:10.240
Yeah, they definitely
get creative.

00:31:10.240 --> 00:31:13.980
I was, wait, did that happen?

00:31:13.980 --> 00:31:15.090
Like mixing things around.

00:31:18.160 --> 00:31:20.310
Any other questions?

00:31:20.310 --> 00:31:22.360
Cooking tips or anything
you guys want to know?

00:31:22.360 --> 00:31:23.860
AUDIENCE: Yeah,
throw 'em out there.

00:31:23.860 --> 00:31:25.875
MELISSA KING:
Yeah, I don't know.

00:31:25.875 --> 00:31:28.920
Ask me something.

00:31:28.920 --> 00:31:31.260
Again, I think just
experiment more.

00:31:31.260 --> 00:31:34.470
If there's ingredients out
there that you've never seen,

00:31:34.470 --> 00:31:39.570
go buy it and taste it
and try to cook with it.

00:31:39.570 --> 00:31:41.880
And you know, recipes
are guidelines.

00:31:41.880 --> 00:31:45.990
You don't have to follow
every little detail.

00:31:45.990 --> 00:31:47.610
I think it's OK
to veer from that,

00:31:47.610 --> 00:31:51.150
and if you don't like a
particular ingredient,

00:31:51.150 --> 00:31:54.330
omit it and try something
else that you do like.

00:31:54.330 --> 00:31:59.640
And there it will evolve into
its own dish that you created.

00:31:59.640 --> 00:32:03.280
So yeah, cooking should be fun.

00:32:03.280 --> 00:32:05.640
AUDIENCE: So I recently
started cooking a lot more.

00:32:05.640 --> 00:32:08.680
Before my husband actually
did 90% of the cooking.

00:32:08.680 --> 00:32:12.150
And once I started cooking more,
he says he loves me more too.

00:32:12.150 --> 00:32:14.940
But I use Instant Pot,
and I was wondering

00:32:14.940 --> 00:32:17.070
if you have Instant
Pot, and if so,

00:32:17.070 --> 00:32:19.650
if you have any favorite
Instant Pot recipes.

00:32:19.650 --> 00:32:21.450
MELISSA KING: I do
not have Instant Pot.

00:32:21.450 --> 00:32:23.690
My sister does,
and she loves it.

00:32:23.690 --> 00:32:28.650
And she's a mom with twins
and she works at Disney,

00:32:28.650 --> 00:32:30.600
and so her life is crazy.

00:32:30.600 --> 00:32:32.670
But yeah, the Instant
Pot is basically

00:32:32.670 --> 00:32:34.800
like a pressure cooker
and a slow cooker,

00:32:34.800 --> 00:32:37.290
from my understanding.

00:32:37.290 --> 00:32:40.080
She's always doing those
Nom Nom paleo recipes, which

00:32:40.080 --> 00:32:41.850
are from my friend Michelle.

00:32:41.850 --> 00:32:44.430
And she actually just
came out with a cookbook.

00:32:44.430 --> 00:32:46.260
But yeah, she's got
great recipes there

00:32:46.260 --> 00:32:48.580
that are really simple.

00:32:48.580 --> 00:32:50.430
They are paleo-focused.

00:32:50.430 --> 00:32:54.600
But you can always add
your own things to that.

00:32:54.600 --> 00:32:58.830
AUDIENCE: Any favorite quick
weeknight dinner recipes

00:32:58.830 --> 00:32:59.940
that are not Instant Pot?

00:33:04.300 --> 00:33:05.550
MELISSA KING: Let me see here.

00:33:05.550 --> 00:33:08.160
Oh, well, my Lemon
Grass Meatball recipe.

00:33:08.160 --> 00:33:10.380
I think you guys are
going to try that later.

00:33:10.380 --> 00:33:11.910
That one is
something that I have

00:33:11.910 --> 00:33:15.480
on the Whole Foods hot bar,
and it's a really easy recipe.

00:33:15.480 --> 00:33:19.810
I have it on my website,
ChefMelissaKing.com.

00:33:19.810 --> 00:33:21.960
At least I think I
have it on my website.

00:33:21.960 --> 00:33:28.650
And it takes about 25 minutes,
and you just marinate the meat.

00:33:28.650 --> 00:33:31.350
And you don't even have to
form them into meatballs.

00:33:31.350 --> 00:33:34.830
You can make a burger
patty with it and grill it.

00:33:34.830 --> 00:33:39.720
But it's got fish sauce,
garlic, ginger, lemon grass,

00:33:39.720 --> 00:33:42.577
all these really yummy flavors.

00:33:42.577 --> 00:33:43.410
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:33:43.410 --> 00:33:44.410
SPEAKER: You're welcome.

00:33:46.990 --> 00:33:50.660
While I'm walking over
here, what are you

00:33:50.660 --> 00:33:53.215
watching on Netflix right now?

00:33:53.215 --> 00:33:54.090
MELISSA KING: I know.

00:33:54.090 --> 00:33:59.440
Well, now that "Game of
Thrones" is over, which I love,

00:33:59.440 --> 00:34:05.041
I've been watching "Insecure,"
which I love as well.

00:34:05.041 --> 00:34:06.790
I don't know, what's
out there these days.

00:34:06.790 --> 00:34:09.206
I feel like after "Game of
Thrones," there's nothing else.

00:34:11.775 --> 00:34:13.150
AUDIENCE: This is
kind of random.

00:34:13.150 --> 00:34:18.159
What's your go to cooking
utensil or certain pot

00:34:18.159 --> 00:34:19.600
or pan that's out there?

00:34:19.600 --> 00:34:22.069
I know some people are
really into cast iron.

00:34:22.069 --> 00:34:23.860
MELISSA KING: I was
just about to say that.

00:34:23.860 --> 00:34:27.550
I'm all about everyone
should have a cast iron pan.

00:34:27.550 --> 00:34:30.489
It's like $20, or you
can go to a flea market

00:34:30.489 --> 00:34:32.350
and get it for
probably even cheaper.

00:34:32.350 --> 00:34:34.570
They last forever,
and if you're going

00:34:34.570 --> 00:34:39.159
to just make a steak at home,
it conducts heat way better

00:34:39.159 --> 00:34:40.330
than any other pan.

00:34:40.330 --> 00:34:44.170
And so you'll get a really
nice crust on your steak

00:34:44.170 --> 00:34:45.639
if you cook with that.

00:34:45.639 --> 00:34:49.697
But I cook everything in it,
like fried eggs and fried rice

00:34:49.697 --> 00:34:50.530
and stuff like that.

00:34:50.530 --> 00:34:53.469
So yeah, definitely
get a cast iron.

00:34:53.469 --> 00:34:56.290
Microplanes are
pretty handy as well.

00:34:56.290 --> 00:35:03.737
It's like a little grater that
grates ginger and lemon zest

00:35:03.737 --> 00:35:04.570
and stuff like that.

00:35:08.890 --> 00:35:09.693
All right.

00:35:09.693 --> 00:35:10.556
Cool.

00:35:10.556 --> 00:35:11.930
SPEAKER: Time for
some ice cream?

00:35:11.930 --> 00:35:12.040
MELISSA KING: Yeah.

00:35:12.040 --> 00:35:12.370
I know.

00:35:12.370 --> 00:35:13.703
Do you guys want some ice cream?

00:35:13.703 --> 00:35:14.830
Ready for that?

00:35:14.830 --> 00:35:16.100
All right.

00:35:16.100 --> 00:35:17.020
Well, thank you guys.

00:35:17.020 --> 00:35:17.830
SPEAKER: Thank you so much.

00:35:17.830 --> 00:35:17.860
Thank you for this.

00:35:17.860 --> 00:35:18.651
Thank you for this.

00:35:18.651 --> 00:35:19.690
This was a lot of fun.

00:35:19.690 --> 00:35:24.240
[APPLAUSE]
