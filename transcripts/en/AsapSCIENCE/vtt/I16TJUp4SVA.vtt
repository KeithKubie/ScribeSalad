00:00:00.299 --> 00:00:04.240
Perhaps the greatest ability possessed by
humans is to innovate and create, in order

00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:07.300
to overcome obstacles and change the world
around us.

00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:11.370
Like the formation of language (1) for example,
which is still one of science’s greatest

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:15.960
mysteries with no consensus on its beginnings,
but undoubtedly changed the world of early

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:21.340
hominin species that have existed for nearly
2.5 million years. Or the ability to control

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:27.019
fire (2), with evidence of cooked food as
far back as 1.5 million years ago. Around

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:33.390
200,000 years ago modern humans evolved, but
it wasn’t until roughly 190,000 years later

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:37.530
that we changed from hunter-gatherer societies
and created agriculture (3) (10,000 BCE).

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:42.230
Gathering seeds, planting and tending to them
has shaped our modern civilization. Shortly

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:45.440
after, the plough (4) was created, transforming
agriculture.

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:50.550
By 5000 BCE we got even more curious about
our globe and created the sailboat (5), opening

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:56.679
up the world of exploration. In 3500 BCE the
first glass (6) is created, and 100 years

00:00:56.679 --> 00:01:00.280
later comes the nail (7) (3400 BCE), found
in Ancient Egypt, helping us create better

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:05.180
structures, which helps extend human life.
A few centuries later, cement (8) is created

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:08.370
(1000 BCE) - the foundation of our civilization,
literally!

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:13.190
Looking to further enhance transportation,
the wheel (9) is invented in 3000 BCE, followed

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:16.670
by soap (10) (2800 BCE), and then the original
computer, or abacus (11) (2700 BCE), which

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:21.330
helps augment human capabilities and shape
our economy. And even though paper (12) won’t

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:27.220
be created until 200 BCE, and the printing
press (13) until 1430 CE, the first libraries

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:32.860
(14) appear in 2600 BCE, with records recorded
onto stone tablets, making knowledge more

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:38.220
accessible to all. By 1500 BCE the alphabet
(15) becomes prevalent in some societies,

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:42.720
as opposed to ideographic letters, further
shaping the transfer of knowledge and 700

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:47.390
years later, our modern number system (16)
from 0-9 comes together, paving the way for

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:48.390
mathematics.

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:53.340
The first democracy (17) began in Greece in
508 BCE, where all members have equal share

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:58.820
to power, and perhaps our favourite innovation,
the Scientific Method (18) has origins in

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:04.860
the time of Aristotle 384 BCE - a process
to acquire information and investigate new

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:09.640
phenomena. We may be a bit biased ;) - and
of course it has been further refined over

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:10.640
time.

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:14.630
The Chinese invent the first compass (19)
in 300 BCE, allowing mariners to navigate

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:18.890
great distances, at the same time the Archimedes
screw (20) is designed, which helps transfer

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:24.110
water from low to high elevations, shaping
irrigation and farming. All of this before

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:25.420
the Common Era (C.E.)

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:30.800
Speaking of time, the first mechanical clock
(21) comes in 725 CE, but it won’t be until

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:37.370
1582 that the Gregorian calendar (22) is created,
which synced people all over the world. Eyeglasses

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:41.580
(23) come in the 13th century, which may seem
minimal, but dramatically raised the collective

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:46.050
human IQ. It was also a precursor to the telescope
(24) (1608) and microscope (25) (1 620). Just

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:50.890
prior to the telescope, in 1542, the idea
that Earth is not the centre of the universe

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:55.530
was groundbreaking, but the Copernican system
(26) put the Sun at the centre of the solar

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:59.459
system - however this wouldn’t be accepted
for hundreds of years.

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:05.170
The late 1600s brought the steam engine (27),
powering not only trains and boats, but factories,

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:09.660
shaping the industrial revolution, which would
later be replaced by the internal combustion

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:13.430
engine (28) (1850). Around this same time
binary numbers (29) (1697) and boolean logic

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:17.150
(30) (1854), which are at the heart of digital
computing, are created, and Newton’s Laws

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:22.400
of Motion and Universal Gravitation (1687)
(31) help shape ideas of physics; though Einstein’s

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:25.290
theory of special (1905) (32) and general
(1915) relativity (33), as well as quantum

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:27.790
theory (34) (1927) would further build upon
these ideas.

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:35.020
Vaccines (35) come in 1796, which in the last
20 years alone have prevented 21 million hospitalizations

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:40.370
and 732,000 deaths. Water purification (36)
(1804) and food preservation (37) (1810) have

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:44.290
also saved millions of lives, while the camera
(38) (1816) has allowed us to capture our

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:48.930
past, and communicate the events of our present.
The next few hundred years would see big advances

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:52.890
in communication with the wireless telegraph
(39) (1837), the telephone (40) (1876), radio

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:55.680
waves (41) (1888) and radio (42) (1906), and
television (43) (20th century) all transforming

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:58.280
our world and making it feel a little smaller.

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:02.880
The world of medicine changed drastically
in 1846 with the advent of anesthesia (44)

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:07.300
and antiseptic (45)(1867), allowing for major
surgeries that would previously be too painful,

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:11.370
saving countless lives. The sanitation system
(46) (1880) also improved the incidence of

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:15.030
many diseases, and refrigeration (47) (1876)
would later change how people eat around the

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:19.139
world. The invention of the light bulb (48)
(1879) falls shortly after, though observations

00:04:19.139 --> 00:04:24.871
of static electricity were made in 600 BCE
and the invention of a simple capacitor (49)

00:04:24.871 --> 00:04:30.100
in 1745 as well as many other discoveries
that paved the way for using electricity.

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:34.689
Transportation took another major step in
1885 with the modern car (50), and later the

00:04:34.689 --> 00:04:38.229
airplane (51) (1903). Semiconductors (52)
would help regulate the flow of electricity

00:04:38.229 --> 00:04:42.289
(1911) and eventually transistors (53) (1947)
without which modern electronic devices could

00:04:42.289 --> 00:04:43.379
not function.

00:04:43.379 --> 00:04:46.870
Many more scientific discoveries would follow,
starting with the electron (54) (1897) which

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:50.279
would help Niels Bohr (55) (1913) create his
model of the atom - although the atom was

00:04:50.279 --> 00:04:55.370
actually first theorized 2300 years earlier
(400 BCE)! Nitrogen fixation (56) (1918) and

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:59.180
plant breeding (57) (9000 BCE) help sustain
our population and are credited with saving

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:03.930
1 billion lives, along with antibiotics (58)
such as penicillin, an accidental discovery

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:08.139
which fights bacterial infections. Birth control
(59) has also reduced the number of children

00:05:08.139 --> 00:05:12.550
women have, allowing for higher quality of
life. Polyethylene (60) and other plastics

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:15.860
are all around us, affecting so many products
we make.

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:20.900
The discovery of DNA (61) in the 1950s unleashed
so much of what we now know about humanity

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:25.180
through heredity and genetics. It would also
lead to genetic engineering (62) (1973) and

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:29.650
genome sequencing (63) (1977) in the 70s.
And in the last 80 years, communication has

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:33.970
taken leaps and bounds forward, starting with
satellite communications (64) in the 40’s

00:05:33.970 --> 00:05:37.939
for TV, weather forecasting and defense, to
the beginnings of the internet (65) in the

00:05:37.939 --> 00:05:42.979
60’s and the personal computer (66) and
GPS (67) in the 70s. Not to mention the device

00:05:42.979 --> 00:05:46.999
that is likely in your hands or your pocket
right now - the smartphone (68), which was

00:05:46.999 --> 00:05:49.290
first invented by IBM in 1994.

00:05:49.290 --> 00:05:54.629
And as technology continues forward here on
Earth, space exploration continues to intrigue

00:05:54.629 --> 00:05:59.990
us, with the first successful orbital launch
(69) in 1957, the first moon landing (70)

00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:05.080
in 1969, and the Hubble telescope (71) in
the 90’s, which is both a spacecraft and

00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:07.780
a telescope that orbits earth every 97 minutes.

00:06:07.780 --> 00:06:10.449
But as we look to the universe and the future,

00:06:10.449 --> 00:06:14.979
what comes next? While sometimes it may seem
like the world is getting darker, these innovations

00:06:14.979 --> 00:06:18.279
show that people live longer, healthier, and
happier lives. Science will only continue

00:06:18.279 --> 00:06:19.389
to innovate and help solve some of the world’s
biggest challenges. One of the best ways to

00:06:19.389 --> 00:06:23.749
make sure we keep innovating is to support
leaders that recognize the importance of public

00:06:23.749 --> 00:06:27.560
research programs from everything to global
health or agriculture or information technology

00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:41.470
or energy.
