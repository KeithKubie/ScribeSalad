00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:05.840
I will now do a presentation
on the center of mass.

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:09.110
And the center mass, hopefully,
is something that

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:12.130
will be a little bit intuitive
to you, and it actually has

00:00:12.130 --> 00:00:14.300
some very neat applications.

00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:18.530
So in very simple terms, the
center of mass is a point.

00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:21.850
Let me draw an object.

00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:25.520
Let's say that this
is my object.

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:26.770
Let's say it's a ruler.

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:33.270
This ruler, it exists,
so it has some mass.

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:35.310
And my question to you is
what is the center mass?

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:37.240
And you say, Sal, well, in order
to know figure out the

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:39.910
center mass, you have to tell me
what the center of mass is.

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:43.340
And what I tell you is the
center mass is a point, and it

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:46.750
actually doesn't have to even
be a point in the object.

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:48.850
I'll do an example soon
where it won't be.

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:49.820
But it's a point.

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:53.705
And at that point, for dealing
with this object as a whole or

00:00:53.705 --> 00:00:57.040
the mass of the object as a
whole, we can pretend that the

00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:59.550
entire mass exists
at that point.

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:01.420
And what do I mean
by saying that?

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:05.540
Well, let's say that the
center of mass is here.

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:06.890
And I'll tell you why
I picked this point.

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:08.200
Because that is pretty close
to where the center

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:09.970
of mass will be.

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:12.980
If the center of mass is there,
and let's say the mass

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:18.110
of this entire ruler is, I don't
know, 10 kilograms. This

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:25.820
ruler, if a force is applied at
the center of mass, let's

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:30.950
say 10 Newtons, so the mass
of the whole ruler is 10

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:37.430
kilograms. If a force is applied
at the center of mass,

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:42.250
this ruler will accelerate the
same exact way as would a

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:43.950
point mass.

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:46.180
Let's say that we just had a
little dot, but that little

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:51.870
dot had the same mass, 10
kilograms, and we were to push

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:54.500
on that dot with 10 Newtons.

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:57.960
In either case, in the case of
the ruler, we would accelerate

00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:58.860
upwards at what?

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:02.460
Force divided by mass, so we
would accelerate upwards at 1

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:04.580
meter per second squared.

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:07.580
And in this case of this
point mass, we would

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:09.009
accelerate that point.

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:10.665
When I say point mass, I'm just
saying something really,

00:02:10.665 --> 00:02:13.500
really small, but it has a mass
of 10 kilograms, so it's

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:15.470
much smaller, but it has the
same mass as this ruler.

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:20.270
This would also accelerate
upwards with a magnitude of 1

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:21.870
meters per second squared.

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:26.660
So why is this useful to us?

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:29.850
Well, sometimes we have some
really crazy objects and we

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:31.550
want to figure out exactly
what it does.

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:35.370
If we know its center of mass
first, we can know how that

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:37.440
object will behave without
having to worry about the

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:38.850
shape of that object.

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:41.730
And I'll give you a really easy
way of realizing where

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:43.270
the center of mass is.

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:47.710
If the object has a uniform
distribution-- when I say

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:51.160
that, it means, for simple
purposes, if it's made out of

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:53.710
the same thing and that thing
that it's made out of, its

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:56.970
density, doesn't really change
throughout the object, the

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:03.490
center of mass will be the
object's geometric center.

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:05.700
So in this case, this
ruler's almost a

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:06.660
one-dimensional object.

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:07.840
We just went halfway.

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:09.670
The distance from here to here
and the distance from here to

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:10.230
here are the same.

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:11.240
This is the center of mass.

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:13.900
If we had a two-dimensional
object, let's say we had this

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:18.080
triangle and we want to figure
out its center of mass, it'll

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:20.070
be the center in
two dimensions.

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:22.370
So it'll be something
like that.

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:28.730
Now, if I had another situation,
let's say I have

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:32.340
this square.

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:34.800
I don't know if that's big
enough for you to see.

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:36.550
I need to draw it a
little thicker.

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:40.890
Let's say I have this square,
but let's say that half of

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:49.945
this square is made from lead.

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:59.630
And let's say the other half
of the square is made from

00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:01.120
something lighter than lead.

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:02.920
It's made of styrofoam.

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:05.450
That is lighter than lead.

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:07.680
So in this situation, the center
of mass isn't going to

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:08.770
be the geographic center.

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:12.080
I don't know how much denser
lead is than styrofoam, but

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:16.360
the center of mass is going to
be someplace closer to the

00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:20.930
right because this object does
not have a uniform density.

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:25.065
It'll actually depend on how
much denser the lead is than

00:04:25.065 --> 00:04:26.730
the styrofoam, which
I don't know.

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:29.100
But hopefully, that gives you a
little intuition of what the

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:31.100
center of mass is.

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:34.130
And now I'll tell you something
a little more

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:35.650
interesting.

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:40.530
Every problem we have done so
far, we actually made the

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:43.360
simplifying assumption that
the force acts on

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:44.930
the center of mass.

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:48.510
So if I have an object, let's
say the object that

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:49.760
looks like a horse.

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:55.590
Let's say that object.

00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:58.210
If this is the object's center
of mass, I don't know where

00:04:58.210 --> 00:05:01.100
the horse's center of mass
normally is, but let's say a

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:03.810
horse's center of
mass is here.

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:10.990
If I apply a force directly on
that center of mass, then the

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:14.310
object will move in the
direction of that force with

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:15.660
the appropriate acceleration.

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:19.390
We could divide the force by the
mass of the entire horse

00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:19.990
and we would figure out the

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:23.080
acceleration in that direction.

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:25.480
But now I will throw in a twist.
And actually, every

00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:28.200
problem we did, all of these
Newton's Law's problems, we

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:32.140
assumed that the force acted
at the center of mass.

00:05:32.140 --> 00:05:35.820
But something more interesting
happens if the force acts away

00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:37.070
from the center of mass.

00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:42.190
Let me actually take
that ruler example.

00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:45.210
I don't know why I even
drew the horse.

00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:52.570
If I have this ruler again and
this is the center of mass, as

00:05:52.570 --> 00:05:56.120
we said, any force that we act
on the center of mass, the

00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:59.040
whole object will move in the
direction of the force.

00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:01.800
It'll be shifted by the
force, essentially.

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:02.810
Now, this is what's
interesting.

00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:06.900
If that's the center of mass and
if I were to apply a force

00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:11.736
someplace else away from the
center of mass, let' say I

00:06:11.736 --> 00:06:15.880
apply a force here, I want you
to think about for a second

00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:18.750
what will probably happen
to the object.

00:06:18.750 --> 00:06:21.220
Well, it turns out that the
object will rotate.

00:06:21.220 --> 00:06:23.240
And so think about if we're on
the space shuttle or we're in

00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:25.540
deep space or something, and
if I have a ruler, and if I

00:06:25.540 --> 00:06:27.980
just push at one end of the
ruler, what's going to happen?

00:06:27.980 --> 00:06:30.240
Am I just going to push the
whole ruler or is the whole

00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:31.300
ruler is going to rotate?

00:06:31.300 --> 00:06:33.430
And hopefully, your intuition
is correct.

00:06:33.430 --> 00:06:36.770
The whole ruler will rotate
around the center of mass.

00:06:36.770 --> 00:06:42.010
And in general, if you were to
throw a monkey wrench at

00:06:42.010 --> 00:06:45.680
someone, and I don't recommend
that you do, but if you did,

00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:48.890
and while the monkey wrench is
spinning in the air, it's

00:06:48.890 --> 00:06:51.480
spinning around its
center of mass.

00:06:51.480 --> 00:06:52.940
Same for a knife.

00:06:52.940 --> 00:06:54.900
If you're a knife catcher,
that's something you should

00:06:54.900 --> 00:07:00.280
think about, that the object,
when it's free, when it's not

00:07:00.280 --> 00:07:03.580
fixed to any point, it rotates
around its center of mass, and

00:07:03.580 --> 00:07:04.570
that's very interesting.

00:07:04.570 --> 00:07:07.650
So you can actually throw random
objects, and that point

00:07:07.650 --> 00:07:09.330
at which it rotates
around, that's the

00:07:09.330 --> 00:07:10.340
object's center of mass.

00:07:10.340 --> 00:07:13.630
That's an experiment that you
should do in an open field

00:07:13.630 --> 00:07:15.690
around no one else.

00:07:15.690 --> 00:07:18.970
Now, with all of this, and
I'll actually in the next

00:07:18.970 --> 00:07:20.290
video tell you what this is.

00:07:20.290 --> 00:07:23.130
When you have a force that
causes rotational motion as

00:07:23.130 --> 00:07:25.970
opposed to a shifting motion,
that's torque, but we'll do

00:07:25.970 --> 00:07:26.850
that in the next video.

00:07:26.850 --> 00:07:30.610
But now I'll show you just a
cool example of how the center

00:07:30.610 --> 00:07:34.880
of mass is relevant in everyday
applications, like

00:07:34.880 --> 00:07:36.890
high jumping.

00:07:36.890 --> 00:07:40.340
So in general, let's say
that this is a bar.

00:07:40.340 --> 00:07:42.690
This is a side view of a
bar, and this is the

00:07:42.690 --> 00:07:43.530
thing holding the bar.

00:07:43.530 --> 00:07:45.440
And a guy wants to jump
over the bar.

00:07:48.810 --> 00:07:51.880
His center of mass is-- most
people's center of mass is

00:07:51.880 --> 00:07:53.170
around their gut.

00:07:53.170 --> 00:07:55.380
I think evolutionarily that's
why our gut is there, because

00:07:55.380 --> 00:07:56.870
it's close to our
center of mass.

00:07:56.870 --> 00:07:58.460
So there's two ways to jump.

00:07:58.460 --> 00:08:01.500
You could just jump straight
over the bar, like a hurdle

00:08:01.500 --> 00:08:06.130
jump, in which case your center
of mass would have to

00:08:06.130 --> 00:08:07.500
cross over the bar.

00:08:07.500 --> 00:08:09.510
And we could figure out this
mass, and we can figure out

00:08:09.510 --> 00:08:12.657
how much energy and how much
force is required to propel a

00:08:12.657 --> 00:08:16.630
mass that high because we know
projectile motion and we know

00:08:16.630 --> 00:08:18.270
all of Newton's laws.

00:08:18.270 --> 00:08:21.410
But what you see a lot in the
Olympics is people doing a

00:08:21.410 --> 00:08:24.810
very strange type of jump,
where, when they're going over

00:08:24.810 --> 00:08:28.430
the bar, they look something
like this.

00:08:28.430 --> 00:08:30.700
Their backs are arched
over the bar.

00:08:34.600 --> 00:08:36.000
Not a good picture.

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:38.520
But what happens when someone
arches their back over

00:08:38.520 --> 00:08:39.340
the bar like this?

00:08:39.340 --> 00:08:40.370
I hope you get the point.

00:08:40.370 --> 00:08:42.440
This is the bar right here.

00:08:42.440 --> 00:08:44.350
Well, it's interesting.

00:08:44.350 --> 00:08:46.390
If you took the average of
this person's density and

00:08:46.390 --> 00:08:48.940
figured out his geometric center
and all of that, the

00:08:48.940 --> 00:08:51.500
center of mass in this
situation, if someone jumps

00:08:51.500 --> 00:08:54.940
like that, actually travels
below the bar.

00:08:54.940 --> 00:08:57.750
Because the person arches their
back so much, if you

00:08:57.750 --> 00:09:00.590
took the average of the total
mass of where the person is,

00:09:00.590 --> 00:09:03.770
their center of mass actually
goes below the bar.

00:09:03.770 --> 00:09:06.320
And because of that, you can
clear a bar without having

00:09:06.320 --> 00:09:08.820
your center of mass go as high
as the bar and so you need

00:09:08.820 --> 00:09:09.960
less force to do it.

00:09:09.960 --> 00:09:13.370
Or another way to say it, with
the same force, you could

00:09:13.370 --> 00:09:14.723
clear a higher bar.

00:09:14.723 --> 00:09:15.530
,

00:09:15.530 --> 00:09:18.720
Hopefully, I didn't confuse you,
but that's exactly why

00:09:18.720 --> 00:09:23.037
these high jumpers arch their
back, so that their center of

00:09:23.037 --> 00:09:26.910
mass is actually below the bar
and they don't have to exert

00:09:26.910 --> 00:09:27.810
as much force.

00:09:27.810 --> 00:09:30.430
Anyway, hopefully you found that
to be a vaguely useful

00:09:30.430 --> 00:09:32.610
introduction to the center of
mass, and I'll see you in the

00:09:32.610 --> 00:09:35.100
next video on torque.
