00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.480
I've got a shape for you Brady if you've

00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:02.490
I've got a shape for you Brady if you've
 

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:03.919
I've got a shape for you Brady if you've
got a shape you want to start putting it

00:00:03.919 --> 00:00:03.929
got a shape you want to start putting it
 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:05.990
got a shape you want to start putting it
together so I've got just these are

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:06.000
together so I've got just these are
 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.059
together so I've got just these are
copies of the same shape and I'm

00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:08.069
copies of the same shape and I'm
 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:11.900
copies of the same shape and I'm
allowing myself to flip them over that's

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:11.910
allowing myself to flip them over that's
 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:14.839
allowing myself to flip them over that's
quite nice I have covered the boundary

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:14.849
quite nice I have covered the boundary
 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:17.930
quite nice I have covered the boundary
of my original shape with copies of the

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:17.940
of my original shape with copies of the
 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:19.820
of my original shape with copies of the
same so we might ask what can I do that

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:19.830
same so we might ask what can I do that
 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:21.890
same so we might ask what can I do that
again keeping going with the shape if I

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900
again keeping going with the shape if I
 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:24.259
again keeping going with the shape if I
had enough of these pieces I could sort

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:24.269
had enough of these pieces I could sort
 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:26.810
had enough of these pieces I could sort
of now I can put some things round and

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820
of now I can put some things round and
 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:30.259
of now I can put some things round and
maybe I can I can sort of get myself

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269
maybe I can I can sort of get myself
 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:31.130
maybe I can I can sort of get myself
into trouble

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140
into trouble
 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:34.280
into trouble
I couldn't get stuck so but maybe if I

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290
I couldn't get stuck so but maybe if I
 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:36.160
I couldn't get stuck so but maybe if I
work hard enough I could put another

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:36.170
work hard enough I could put another
 

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:39.319
work hard enough I could put another
loop round and maybe another one maybe I

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329
loop round and maybe another one maybe I
 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:41.150
loop round and maybe another one maybe I
could go on forever maybe not this tile

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160
could go on forever maybe not this tile
 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:42.709
could go on forever maybe not this tile
was discovered by someone called Casey

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719
was discovered by someone called Casey
 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:45.290

man he actually started knowing that

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300
man he actually started knowing that
 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.060
man he actually started knowing that
this is a tile where you cannot go on

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070
this is a tile where you cannot go on
 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:49.549
this is a tile where you cannot go on
forever and the way we describe that is

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559
forever and the way we describe that is
 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:53.029
forever and the way we describe that is
this is an unbalanced tile so if you

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039
this is an unbalanced tile so if you
 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:55.369
this is an unbalanced tile so if you
look at it there's one part of this tile

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379
look at it there's one part of this tile
 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:57.380
look at it there's one part of this tile
this piece here we've got an arc of a

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390
this piece here we've got an arc of a
 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:00.560
this piece here we've got an arc of a
circle where I can fit something on and

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570
circle where I can fit something on and
 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:03.340
circle where I can fit something on and
it can serve but I can only fit the

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:03.350
it can serve but I can only fit the
 

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:06.830
it can serve but I can only fit the
pieces of the tile that curve in onto

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840
pieces of the tile that curve in onto
 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:08.480
pieces of the tile that curve in onto
the piece that curves out now all these

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490
the piece that curves out now all these
 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:11.539
the piece that curves out now all these
arcs are sort of multiples of a sixth of

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549
arcs are sort of multiples of a sixth of
 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:15.200
arcs are sort of multiples of a sixth of
a circle and so if I sort of look round

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210
a circle and so if I sort of look round
 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:16.070
a circle and so if I sort of look round
this

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080
this
 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:19.100
this
this shape here I've got the positive

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110
this shape here I've got the positive
 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:23.359
this shape here I've got the positive
piece the convex piece and that has four

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369
piece the convex piece and that has four
 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:26.870
piece the convex piece and that has four
and then here I have concave and that's

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880
and then here I have concave and that's
 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:31.130
and then here I have concave and that's
actually two there I have one there here

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140
actually two there I have one there here
 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:36.980
actually two there I have one there here
we have three and here we have one so if

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990
we have three and here we have one so if
 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:39.350
we have three and here we have one so if
you notice the negatives one two three

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360
you notice the negatives one two three
 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:42.200
you notice the negatives one two three
four five six seven the positive zone

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210
four five six seven the positive zone
 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:44.960
four five six seven the positive zone
four and so as I keep on going the

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970
four and so as I keep on going the
 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:48.109
four and so as I keep on going the
amount of negative relative to positive

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119
amount of negative relative to positive
 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:49.730
amount of negative relative to positive
is going to grow and grow well and at

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740
is going to grow and grow well and at
 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:51.050
is going to grow and grow well and at
some point it's going to overwhelm

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060
some point it's going to overwhelm
 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:52.850
some point it's going to overwhelm
things this is a tile we're gonna have

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860
things this is a tile we're gonna have
 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:55.850
things this is a tile we're gonna have
to stop at some point and the time where

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860
to stop at some point and the time where
 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:58.880
to stop at some point and the time where
we stop the number of rings we can do is

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890
we stop the number of rings we can do is
 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:00.440
we stop the number of rings we can do is
something called the huge number so

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450
something called the huge number so
 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:02.840
something called the huge number so
what's the H number for that shape so

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850
what's the H number for that shape so
 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:04.730
what's the H number for that shape so
the huge number for this shape is is

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740
the huge number for this shape is is
 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:08.029
the huge number for this shape is is
three and here is something where we can

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039
three and here is something where we can
 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:11.930
three and here is something where we can
show those rings and so no matter how

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940
show those rings and so no matter how
 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:13.280
show those rings and so no matter how
hard you try

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290
hard you try
 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:15.679
hard you try
you can't go further than that with this

00:02:15.679 --> 00:02:15.689
you can't go further than that with this
 

00:02:15.689 --> 00:02:17.690
you can't go further than that with this
particular time we can ask what what

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:17.700
particular time we can ask what what
 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:19.280
particular time we can ask what what
other numbers can be heat numbers

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:19.290
other numbers can be heat numbers
 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:21.500
other numbers can be heat numbers
what about circle what's the huge number

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:21.510
what about circle what's the huge number
 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:25.970
what about circle what's the huge number
of a circle so when you surround it it

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:25.980
of a circle so when you surround it it
 

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:27.619
of a circle so when you surround it it
has to also be touched at every edge

00:02:27.619 --> 00:02:27.629
has to also be touched at every edge
 

00:02:27.629 --> 00:02:29.479
has to also be touched at every edge
right you really need to surround it

00:02:29.479 --> 00:02:29.489
right you really need to surround it
 

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:31.339
right you really need to surround it
profit possible so the circle I've just

00:02:31.339 --> 00:02:31.349
profit possible so the circle I've just
 

00:02:31.349 --> 00:02:34.160
profit possible so the circle I've just
written at each number it's zero another

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:34.170
written at each number it's zero another
 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:38.420
written at each number it's zero another
simple example is the square you could

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:38.430
simple example is the square you could
 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:40.220
simple example is the square you could
do that forever yeah so the huge numbers

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:40.230
do that forever yeah so the huge numbers
 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:43.190
do that forever yeah so the huge numbers
infinity this shape here lies somewhere

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:43.200
infinity this shape here lies somewhere
 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:46.849
infinity this shape here lies somewhere
between the circle with zero and the

00:02:46.849 --> 00:02:46.859
between the circle with zero and the
 

00:02:46.859 --> 00:02:49.130
between the circle with zero and the
square with infinity and obviously

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:49.140
square with infinity and obviously
 

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:51.589
square with infinity and obviously
complete rings they have to be whole

00:02:51.589 --> 00:02:51.599
complete rings they have to be whole
 

00:02:51.599 --> 00:02:54.440
complete rings they have to be whole
numbers there's a fairly old example

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:54.450
numbers there's a fairly old example
 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:57.830
numbers there's a fairly old example
which looks like this and this is an

00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:57.840
which looks like this and this is an
 

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:00.140
which looks like this and this is an
early example and it has he's number one

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:00.150
early example and it has he's number one
 

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:03.199
early example and it has he's number one
so that means I can cover the boundary

00:03:03.199 --> 00:03:03.209
so that means I can cover the boundary
 

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:06.280
so that means I can cover the boundary
of this tile completely with copies of

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:06.290
of this tile completely with copies of
 

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:09.410
of this tile completely with copies of
this type once but then I can't go any

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:09.420
this type once but then I can't go any
 

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:11.059
this type once but then I can't go any
further we can have examples where you

00:03:11.059 --> 00:03:11.069
further we can have examples where you
 

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:16.400
further we can have examples where you
can do two rings

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:16.410
 

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:19.320
three rings like the example we started

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:19.330
three rings like the example we started
 

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:28.080
three rings like the example we started
with and four rings you can even get up

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:28.090
with and four rings you can even get up
 

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:32.820
with and four rings you can even get up
to doing five whole rings and you can

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:32.830
to doing five whole rings and you can
 

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:35.820
to doing five whole rings and you can
see this shape does it and you're seeing

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:35.830
see this shape does it and you're seeing
 

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:37.290
see this shape does it and you're seeing
how this could be quite a complex

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:37.300
how this could be quite a complex
 

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:39.360
how this could be quite a complex
operation here that this is not the

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:39.370
operation here that this is not the
 

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:41.370
operation here that this is not the
natural way necessarily you might feel

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:41.380
natural way necessarily you might feel
 

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:42.810
natural way necessarily you might feel
the obvious way you can get yourself

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:42.820
the obvious way you can get yourself
 

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:45.870
the obvious way you can get yourself
into trouble in all sorts of places as

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:45.880
into trouble in all sorts of places as
 

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:48.780
into trouble in all sorts of places as
you put things on and in fact this tile

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:48.790
you put things on and in fact this tile
 

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:51.000
you put things on and in fact this tile

Casey man is the world record holder and

00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:53.500
Casey man is the world record holder and

there could be a shape out there that
will do it and then stop yeah we believe

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:18.790
will do it and then stop yeah we believe
 

00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:20.970
will do it and then stop yeah we believe
that would be the case this is linked to

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:20.980
that would be the case this is linked to
 

00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:23.220
that would be the case this is linked to
some other tiling problems but we sort

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:23.230
some other tiling problems but we sort

yeah this is a problem which now has a

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:36.550
yeah this is a problem which now has a
 

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:39.060
yeah this is a problem which now has a
little bit of an knowledge about it so

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:39.070
little bit of an knowledge about it so
 

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:41.070

if you were to if you were to make
 

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:44.580
if you were to if you were to make
significant progress on it then people

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:44.590
significant progress on it then people
 

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:47.159
significant progress on it then people
would look at and take note although

00:04:47.159 --> 00:04:47.169
would look at and take note although
 

00:04:47.169 --> 00:04:49.409
would look at and take note although
significant progress is probably

00:04:49.409 --> 00:04:49.419
significant progress is probably
 

00:04:49.419 --> 00:04:51.330
significant progress is probably

and so both of the two examples from

00:04:56.909 --> 00:04:56.919
and so both of the two examples from
 

00:04:56.919 --> 00:04:59.820
and so both of the two examples from
from Casey man this example with with

Einstein as in one tile and that asks if

00:05:37.230 --> 00:05:37.240
Einstein as in one tile and that asks if
 

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:39.960

German so it's a bad pun which will tile

00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:43.930
German so it's a bad pun which will tile
 

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:47.730
German so it's a bad pun which will tile
the plane but not periodically so all

00:05:47.730 --> 00:05:47.740
the plane but not periodically so all
 

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:49.409
the plane but not periodically so all
the infinite tilings we know so far a

00:05:49.409 --> 00:05:49.419
the infinite tilings we know so far a
 

00:05:49.419 --> 00:05:51.450
the infinite tilings we know so far a
periodic no we have things like the

00:05:51.450 --> 00:05:51.460
periodic no we have things like the
 

00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:53.279
periodic no we have things like the
Penrose tiling but that has two

00:05:53.279 --> 00:05:53.289
Penrose tiling but that has two
 

00:05:53.289 --> 00:05:55.650
Penrose tiling but that has two
different shapes so you take your shape

00:05:55.650 --> 00:05:55.660
different shapes so you take your shape
 

00:05:55.660 --> 00:05:57.540
different shapes so you take your shape
you put it together in all possible ways

00:05:57.540 --> 00:05:57.550
you put it together in all possible ways
 

00:05:57.550 --> 00:06:01.020
you put it together in all possible ways
and you can cover the whole plane but

00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:01.030
and you can cover the whole plane but
 

00:06:01.030 --> 00:06:02.339
and you can cover the whole plane but
there none of them which are like the

00:06:02.339 --> 00:06:02.349
there none of them which are like the
 

00:06:02.349 --> 00:06:04.770

squares the tiling of squares which I

00:06:04.770 --> 00:06:04.780
squares the tiling of squares which I
 

00:06:04.780 --> 00:06:07.170
squares the tiling of squares which I
can just pick up shift and put down and

can just pick up shift and put down and
 

00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:09.810
can just pick up shift and put down and
it's the same everywhere when I do that

00:06:09.810 --> 00:06:09.820
it's the same everywhere when I do that
 

00:06:09.820 --> 00:06:12.450
it's the same everywhere when I do that
so that with the Einstein problem you

00:06:12.450 --> 00:06:12.460
so that with the Einstein problem you
 

00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:15.089
so that with the Einstein problem you
you would find a single tile that can

00:06:15.089 --> 00:06:15.099
you would find a single tile that can
 

00:06:15.099 --> 00:06:16.830
you would find a single tile that can
create tilings of the plane but not

00:06:16.830 --> 00:06:16.840
create tilings of the plane but not
 

00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:19.110
create tilings of the plane but not
periodically you're asking for tilings

00:06:19.110 --> 00:06:19.120
periodically you're asking for tilings
 

00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:20.909
periodically you're asking for tilings
that will only produce non periodic

00:06:20.909 --> 00:06:20.919
that will only produce non periodic
 

00:06:20.919 --> 00:06:23.010
that will only produce non periodic
tiling there is a slight cheat with the

00:06:23.010 --> 00:06:23.020
tiling there is a slight cheat with the
 

00:06:23.020 --> 00:06:24.089

00:06:30.669 --> 00:06:33.029
always had an interest in mathematics
and spent in particular this problem and

00:06:33.029 --> 00:06:33.039
and spent in particular this problem and
 

00:06:33.039 --> 00:06:36.540
and spent in particular this problem and
so about ten years ago now she found a

00:06:36.540 --> 00:06:36.550
so about ten years ago now she found a
 

00:06:36.550 --> 00:06:39.360
so about ten years ago now she found a
single tile that has this property the

00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:39.370
single tile that has this property the
 

00:06:39.370 --> 00:06:41.909
single tile that has this property the
only problem is that it's not a

00:06:41.909 --> 00:06:41.919
only problem is that it's not a
 

00:06:41.919 --> 00:06:45.899
only problem is that it's not a
connected tile I can draw some path we

00:06:45.899 --> 00:06:45.909
connected tile I can draw some path we
 

00:06:45.909 --> 00:06:47.550
connected tile I can draw some path we
might set in here this is a connected

00:06:47.550 --> 00:06:47.560
might set in here this is a connected
 

00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:50.100

object I can if I'm somewhere on this

00:06:50.100 --> 00:06:50.110

island I can get anywhere else but

00:06:53.670 --> 00:06:53.680
island I can get anywhere else but
 

00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:56.450
island I can get anywhere else but
imagine if I say well my island is

00:06:56.450 --> 00:06:56.460
imagine if I say well my island is
 

00:06:56.460 --> 00:06:59.209
imagine if I say well my island is
officially going to be this piece and

00:06:59.209 --> 00:06:59.219
officially going to be this piece and
 

00:06:59.219 --> 00:07:02.100
officially going to be this piece and
this piece now I can only move them

00:07:02.100 --> 00:07:02.110
this piece now I can only move them
 

00:07:02.110 --> 00:07:03.870
this piece now I can only move them
around together I can't move them freely

00:07:03.870 --> 00:07:03.880
around together I can't move them freely
 

00:07:03.880 --> 00:07:05.760
around together I can't move them freely
they you know they stay in the same

00:07:05.760 --> 00:07:05.770
they you know they stay in the same
 

00:07:05.770 --> 00:07:08.459
they you know they stay in the same
places so that's a single shape but with

00:07:08.459 --> 00:07:08.469
places so that's a single shape but with
 

00:07:08.469 --> 00:07:12.990
places so that's a single shape but with
two pieces and so she found a particular

00:07:12.990 --> 00:07:13.000
two pieces and so she found a particular
 

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:16.110
two pieces and so she found a particular
shape that has this property you can see

00:07:16.110 --> 00:07:16.120
shape that has this property you can see
 

00:07:16.120 --> 00:07:18.930
shape that has this property you can see
it there and this will only tile non

00:07:18.930 --> 00:07:18.940
it there and this will only tile non
 

00:07:18.940 --> 00:07:19.680
it there and this will only tile non

00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:19.690
periodically
 

00:07:19.690 --> 00:07:22.379
periodically
but yeah just like cheated it's it's a

00:07:22.379 --> 00:07:22.389
but yeah just like cheated it's it's a
 

00:07:22.389 --> 00:07:24.120
but yeah just like cheated it's it's a
really nice result because this was a

00:07:24.120 --> 00:07:24.130
really nice result because this was a
 

00:07:24.130 --> 00:07:25.980
really nice result because this was a
problem that was like fifty or sixty

00:07:25.980 --> 00:07:25.990
problem that was like fifty or sixty
 

00:07:25.990 --> 00:07:28.560
problem that was like fifty or sixty
years old I say often in mathematics

00:07:28.560 --> 00:07:28.570
years old I say often in mathematics
 

00:07:28.570 --> 00:07:30.540
years old I say often in mathematics
when you can't solve a problem for long

when you can't solve a problem for long
 

00:07:30.550 --> 00:07:33.480
when you can't solve a problem for long
enough even a solution it's a little bit

enough even a solution it's a little bit
 

00:07:33.490 --> 00:07:37.080
enough even a solution it's a little bit
of a cheat can be a useful inflammation

00:07:37.080 --> 00:07:37.090
of a cheat can be a useful inflammation
 

00:07:37.090 --> 00:07:40.439
of a cheat can be a useful inflammation
and it's a very valid cheat if that

and it's a very valid cheat if that
 

00:07:40.449 --> 00:07:42.930
and it's a very valid cheat if that
makes sense because you do have one

00:07:42.930 --> 00:07:42.940
makes sense because you do have one
