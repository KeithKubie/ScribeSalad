00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
We've really learned a lot.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Surely, we'll be able to answer a simple question, right?

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.000
For example, if Galileo drops a ball off the leaning tower, how far does it fall in 2 seconds?

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
Can we answer that? Well, we want to know distance.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:16.000
I'm thinking we going to use our relationship with x, and it's somehow proportional to t².

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:21.000
But unfortunately, this is not enough information.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
Remember how we solved this. We used ratios.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
Ratios mean we need to compare two things.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:31.000
If I knew how far the ball fell in 1 second or in 10 seconds or in 7 seconds, yes, I could solve this.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
But I haven't even told you that.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
It looks like we might be in trouble.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
What we want is not a proportionality relationship.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
We want an equality.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.000
We want x equals some constant--some number that never changes--times t².

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
This constant is called the constant of proportionality.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
Before I just tell you what the constant is

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:54.000
let's learn about an amazing physical tool called dimensional analysis

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.000
where "dimensional" refers to the dimensions or units of a number,

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
because right now we know nothing about this constant.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
It could have units of length. It could have units of time.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000
It could have units of time squared over length cubed. We just don't know.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000
Let's use dimensional analysis to figure out what the units of this constant should be.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000
We do dimensional analysis by converting everything into units of length, time, and mass,

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000
combination of these. Let me show you what I mean.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.000
Let's look at this equation x equals something times time squared.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000
Just keep track of the units.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000
Well, x is a unit of length. It's a unit of distance.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000
On the left hand side I'll write length.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:37.000
That equals some unknown here multiplied by something with units of time squared.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000
Solving for my question mark,

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
I find that the units of this unknown constant are length/time squared.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
What has units of length/time squared?

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.000
Well, length/time squared could be something like meters per second squared.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
That's acceleration.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:57.000
This constant of proportionality that relates time and position has units of acceleration.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000
Pretty cool.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000
It turns out that this constant of proportionality is just 1/2 the acceleration

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000
of the object that we're talking about.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:08.000
For objects in free fall on earth, this acceleration happens to be equal to 10 m/s²,

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.000
which is why I've been using this as an example acceleration so much.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.000
In fact, this number is so important we give it the abbreviation "g."

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.000
But keep in mind we only use this number when an object's in free fall.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.000
When an object's rolling, this acceleration will be--well, you tell me.

00:02:22.000 --> 99:59:59.000
Does an object rolling accelerate faster or slower?
