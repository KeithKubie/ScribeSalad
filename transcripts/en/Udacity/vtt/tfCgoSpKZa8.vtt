00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:03.340
So what are some reasons you might
want to consider investment for

00:00:03.340 --> 00:00:04.520
your business?

00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:07.670
Let's look at what investing is then
go over some of the benefits and

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:10.440
downsides of choosing this option for
your startup.

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:12.840
First, what is investing?

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:15.390
Investing is the process of
putting money into something

00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:17.840
in hope of financial or material gain.

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:19.050
So, when you're looking for

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:22.550
investors you'll be dealing with people
who want to give you money upfront

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:25.630
in exchange for later returns
on this initial investment.

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:29.180
The motivations of each individual
investor may vary, but keeping their

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:31.980
incentives in mind will help you
better understand the benefits and

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:34.470
downsides of dealing with investors.

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:38.000
So, why might you consider
working with these investors?

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.670
Let's overview three of them,
funding, contacts, and motivation.

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:44.470
First, funding.

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:47.550
An obvious benefit of dealing with
investors is that they have money

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:50.220
available to help you
jumpstart your business.

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:52.600
With investment,
you can expand more quickly and

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:55.260
allocate some of the risk
to your investors.

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.040
Next, contacts and advice.

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:01.420
Many investors have groups of other
investors, entrepreneurs, and

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:03.410
advisors they associate with.

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:06.520
You can use their contacts
to seek more funding.

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:10.470
It's in an investor's best interest to
help you get the resources you need and

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:13.060
the right investor will
be able to provide them.

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:15.700
And finally, motivation.

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:17.900
An investment is in some
ways like a marriage.

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:20.740
If you marry the wrong person,
working with them will be miserable, and

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:22.700
they may end up sinking the business.

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:25.750
But finding the right investor
means both monetary investment and

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:27.200
personal investment.

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:29.520
They'll be there through many
of the obstacles you face and

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:33.270
will give a second set of eyes on
what you're spending your money on.

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:36.560
If having someone else around helps
provide the motivation you need

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:39.608
then an investor can be
a great asset to your company.

00:01:39.608 --> 00:01:42.930
So, those are some of the benefits
of working with investors, but

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:44.660
what are some of the downsides?

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:49.192
Let's look at three, rate of return,
communication, and control.

00:01:49.192 --> 00:01:49.692
First, rate of return.

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:55.410
Above all else, investors are trying
to make money, and they expect a higher

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:58.740
rate of return than what traditional
investments can provide.

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:01.220
What is important to
an investor is how your plan

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:03.570
ends up with more money
in their pockets.

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:06.490
It can be difficult to balance this
pressure from investors with your

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:07.700
original vision.

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:10.759
Because of this you'll end up needing
to communicate your decisions with

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:11.950
investors.

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:14.270
You'll spend more time
explaining your ideas and

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:16.710
dealing with the political
aspects of your company.

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:18.080
And finally, control.

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:21.780
Sometimes the decisions you
make won't be well accepted and

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:24.400
could even scare away
potential investors.

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:27.590
Even though it is your company,
once an investor is involved,

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:30.340
you've given up some of the control
you had over the direction you take.

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:34.440
Does reaching out to an investor
seem like a good option to you?

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:36.580
Take some time to consider
each of the benefits and

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:38.900
downsides of working with investors for
your startup.
