00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.029
&gt;&gt;&gt; 
Good morning, Googlers.

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:10.410
Thanks for being here.
I'm Alan Davidson, your policy guy in Washington,

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:14.040
D.C.
And on behalf of the visits team and Google

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:20.279
NetPAC, I'd like to welcome you to the first
in our series of 2010 campaign forums.

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:28.830
And today we're going to be joined by California's
current attorney general and the Democratic

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:31.960
candidate -- a Democratic candidate for governor,
Jerry Brown.

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:39.320
As some of you probably recall, in 2008, we
led and had an extraordinary series of visits

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:45.520
from presidential candidates, Hillary Clinton,
John McCain, now President Barack Obama.

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:52.059
And we are going to be hoping to follow in
those footsteps with a series in 2010 focused

00:00:52.059 --> 00:00:57.460
on statewide races.
And today's the first of those.

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:02.520
Short commercial message.
In -- next week, on Tuesday, we'll be joined

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:05.180
by insurance commissioner Steve Poizner, Poizner,
rather, who is one of the leading Republican

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:07.250
candidates for the governor's race.
And we invite you all to come.

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:16.549
I should also note that we have invited Meg
Whitman, another of the major candidates for

00:01:16.549 --> 00:01:25.579
the governor's race, despite her checkered
past, at a small company down the road.

00:01:25.579 --> 00:01:29.240
And we're very hopeful that she'll join us,
probably after the primaries.

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:37.719
Just a short word about Governor Brown.
You know, at Google, we take pride in being

00:01:37.719 --> 00:01:41.509
fully engaged in the world around us.
That includes our own backyard and our own

00:01:41.509 --> 00:01:44.499
home state.
So it is really appropriate and great that

00:01:44.499 --> 00:01:51.149
we're able to kick off this series by hearing
Governor Brown's visionary -- or former Governor

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:55.590
Brown's, Attorney General Brown's vision for
California.

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:59.460
Jerry Brown has a storied history in California
politics.

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:04.520
His father was governor of California from
1959 to 1967.

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:11.310
He himself was elected to governor twice,
in 1974 and then again in 1978.

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:16.640
He's run for president three times.
And in the 1992 race, in fact, I remember

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:23.430
very well, he refused to take contributions
larger than $100 and used an 800 number, which

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:29.989
we learned was still in existence -- is still
in existence today -- used an 800 number to

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:33.113
raise funds.
I just say, you know, the Internet really

00:02:33.113 --> 00:02:34.113
could have helped you back then.
[ Laughter ]

00:02:34.113 --> 00:02:35.113
&gt;&gt;&gt; I hope you'll use it this time around
more.

00:02:35.113 --> 00:02:39.230
In 1998, Brown ran for mayor of Oakland and
won.

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:42.140
He was re-elected in 2002.
Today, he is California's attorney general,

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:48.819
and a Democratic candidate for governor.
He is going to be joined today on the podium

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:56.040
by our CEO, of course, Eric Schmidt, who will
lead us in a short fireside chat.

00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:01.340
Then we will open it up for your questions.
Please join me in welcoming Eric and Jerry

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:05.060
Brown.
[ Applause ]

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:15.969
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: Well, thank you, Alan.
And, governor, welcome to Google?

00:03:15.969 --> 00:03:19.840
&gt;&gt;Hon. Jerry Brown: Thank you.
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: You have served our nation

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:24.349
and our state for many, many years, as a governor,
twice.

00:03:24.349 --> 00:03:31.719
And you're now running for governor again.
Now, it seems to me that the state that you're

00:03:31.719 --> 00:03:36.430
thinking about becoming governor again, let's
see, it's the sixth or seventh largest in

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:39.840
the -- economy in the world.
If it were, it would be a bankrupt country,

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:41.879
$41 billion of debt.
A million employees.

00:03:41.879 --> 00:03:45.359
&gt;&gt;Hon. Jerry Brown: Wait a minute --
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: I haven't even asked my question.

00:03:45.359 --> 00:03:48.069
&gt;&gt;Hon. Jerry Brown: We compare very favorably
with Greece.

00:03:48.069 --> 00:03:51.200
[ Laughter ]
&gt;&gt;Hon. Jerry Brown: And I want to explain

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:52.230
why.
The --

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:54.019
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: Let me just ask my question,
governor.

00:03:54.019 --> 00:03:56.620
&gt;&gt;Hon. Jerry Brown: Go ahead.
Well, this is not about answering your question,

00:03:56.620 --> 00:03:58.250
but just a factoid.
But go ahead.

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:02.999
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: The question is, why in the
world do you want to be governor of California?

00:04:02.999 --> 00:04:06.189
&gt;&gt;Hon. Jerry Brown: All right.
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: You've already been it.

00:04:06.189 --> 00:04:08.510
&gt;&gt;Hon. Jerry Brown: Yeah, I've already been
it.

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:11.629
But that was different.
That's when the budget was one-sixth of what

00:04:11.629 --> 00:04:14.950
it is today and we didn't have all these problems
that have been created by all the governors

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:17.420
that came after me.
[ Laughter ]

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:24.220
&gt;&gt;Hon. Jerry Brown: So -- no, I have to mention
the comparison with Greece.

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:32.300
The relationship of the deficit in Greece
to the national gross domestic product is

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:36.370
about 12%.
In the United States, the federal government

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:40.520
is 10%.
In California, it's in the range of 1 to one

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:44.889
and a half percent.
So when you only have a 1, 1.5% deficit and

00:04:44.889 --> 00:04:51.590
your gross product is 1.7 trillion in a bad
year, you've got a manageable problem.

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:56.680
And I do think it's serious.
It really is going to call forth for a lot

00:04:56.680 --> 00:05:01.569
of collaboration and courage, much of which
we haven't seen in the past.

00:05:01.569 --> 00:05:04.690
But it's doable.
Why I want to do this?

00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:08.949
That is a good question.
I ask myself that over and over again.

00:05:08.949 --> 00:05:15.410
I am drawn to the task.
Perhaps as to the fire.

00:05:15.410 --> 00:05:18.340
But I have studied this government for most
of my life.

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:24.300
I studied it, really, when my father was governor
and attorney general.

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:30.190
And I did this for eight years.
I learned a tremendous amount.

00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:33.259
And then after that, I went on to do other
things.

00:05:33.259 --> 00:05:37.500
And looking back, now I see it from the point
of view of being a mayor for eight years,

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:40.870
being a lawyer for the governor and the state
departments.

00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:48.039
So I've seen all the variations and aspects
of what this government is, and also the politics

00:05:48.039 --> 00:05:52.570
in which it's embedded.
And I really think that I could make a difference

00:05:52.570 --> 00:05:57.020
and I could -- that I can grapple with these
problems in a very effective way.

00:05:57.020 --> 00:06:04.720
And I was very glad to see -- there was a
research report out that showed that the older

00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:10.680
people are, the greater their wisdom.
This is now empirically based.

00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:12.210
And if we --
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: You're speaking to a young

00:06:12.210 --> 00:06:13.210
crowd.
&gt;&gt;Hon. Jerry Brown: Right.

00:06:13.210 --> 00:06:15.750
[ Laughter ]
&gt;&gt;Hon. Jerry Brown: Well, I want to have something

00:06:15.750 --> 00:06:18.470
 -- you have something to look forward to.
[ Laughter ]

00:06:18.470 --> 00:06:22.509
&gt;&gt;Hon. Jerry Brown: So wisdom.
There's a few other things that may not be

00:06:22.509 --> 00:06:25.980
in as great supply.
But I would say that wisdom is something we

00:06:25.980 --> 00:06:29.820
need, insight.
This is not something you kind of wake up

00:06:29.820 --> 00:06:33.180
in the morning and look in the mirror and
say, "Gee, I'd like to be governor."

00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:36.539
There's a lot to this.
And I think we can pull it off, we can pull

00:06:36.539 --> 00:06:40.930
Californians together.
But it's going to have to be very creative.

00:06:40.930 --> 00:06:43.909
It's going to have to be very courageous.
And I think it's going to have to be based

00:06:43.909 --> 00:06:48.990
on knowledge and skill and familiarity with
what's at stake.

00:06:48.990 --> 00:06:51.419
And what's involved.
So that's why I'm doing it.

00:06:51.419 --> 00:06:59.639
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: So when you were younger,
less wise, for both of us, you were quite

00:06:59.639 --> 00:07:05.819
an interesting governor.
You, among other things, proposed a satellite

00:07:05.819 --> 00:07:08.650
for California.
&gt;&gt;Hon. Jerry Brown: I did.

00:07:08.650 --> 00:07:14.850
That's -- the reason I proposed a satellite
was because we had a state astronaut in those

00:07:14.850 --> 00:07:18.300
days.
Rusty Schweikart, from Apollo 17, was a man

00:07:18.300 --> 00:07:25.349
I met, and he made him my science advisor.
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: Everyone has a satellite now.

00:07:25.349 --> 00:07:26.500
We have a satellite.
&gt;&gt;Hon. Jerry Brown: Right.

00:07:26.500 --> 00:07:29.690
But no governor at that point --
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: We have our own astronaut.

00:07:29.690 --> 00:07:31.050
&gt;&gt;Hon. Jerry Brown: Do you have your own astronaut?
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: Yes, of course.

00:07:31.050 --> 00:07:34.470
We have a couple.
&gt;&gt;Hon. Jerry Brown: Yeah, but this is Google,

00:07:34.470 --> 00:07:38.259
not the state of California.
And we're much slower in our introduction

00:07:38.259 --> 00:07:42.920
of new thoughts.
So the idea of the satellite, quite frankly,

00:07:42.920 --> 00:07:48.350
I used to ride the plane -- at that time,
it was PSA -- and I'd go back and forth from

00:07:48.350 --> 00:07:51.289
L.A. to Sacramento.
And I saw all these government workers carrying

00:07:51.289 --> 00:07:54.939
their briefcases.
I thought, moving all this weight around,

00:07:54.939 --> 00:07:58.539
couldn't we do it digitally?
Couldn't we do it by satellite?

00:07:58.539 --> 00:08:03.719
And that was the genesis of the Syncom IV
satellite, which we could have had for $5

00:08:03.719 --> 00:08:08.400
million back in 1978, had the legislature
gone along with it.

00:08:08.400 --> 00:08:11.551
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: Of course, this led you to
your most famous name of the time.

00:08:11.551 --> 00:08:16.650
&gt;&gt;Hon. Jerry Brown: Yeah, Governor Moonbeam.
But I earned that not just from the state

00:08:16.650 --> 00:08:19.259
satellite, from many other things that I did.
That had a certain --

00:08:19.259 --> 00:08:21.310
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: I've been dying to ask you
this question.

00:08:21.310 --> 00:08:26.430
You were the governor when I first came to
California.

00:08:26.430 --> 00:08:33.390
And you refused to go in the limo.
And, instead, you insisted on going in the

00:08:33.390 --> 00:08:34.650
government Plymouth.
&gt;&gt;Hon. Jerry Brown: Yes.

00:08:34.650 --> 00:08:39.090
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: And this Plymouth, by the
way, is in the state museum.

00:08:39.090 --> 00:08:44.770
It has been suggested that because of the
deficit, this Plymouth be sold to raise funds.

00:08:44.770 --> 00:08:50.220
When you also were governor, you refused to
sleep in the governor's mansion.

00:08:50.220 --> 00:08:55.120
Was this some sort of rejection of father
or something like that?

00:08:55.120 --> 00:08:59.291
Or what was going on in the 1970s.
&gt;&gt;Hon. Jerry Brown: You want me to link the

00:08:59.291 --> 00:09:02.400
Plymouth with the not living in the mansion?
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: Yeah.

00:09:02.400 --> 00:09:04.500
&gt;&gt;Hon. Jerry Brown: Well, the two -- well,
it's very simple.

00:09:04.500 --> 00:09:09.360
I didn't live in the mansion because the mansion,
first of all, was in the suburbs, 20 minutes

00:09:09.360 --> 00:09:12.890
away.
Nancy Reagan had moved out of the old mansion,

00:09:12.890 --> 00:09:17.450
which was perfectly fine.
But they didn't like the neighborhood.

00:09:17.450 --> 00:09:23.530
And so I thought me living in this new suburban
mansion would be silly, because it was huge,

00:09:23.530 --> 00:09:26.260
by myself.
So I thought a little apartment right across

00:09:26.260 --> 00:09:32.730
from the capitol would not only be very convenient,
but it was a contribution to revitalizing

00:09:32.730 --> 00:09:36.200
downtown Sacramento.
And I did that in Oakland.

00:09:36.200 --> 00:09:41.290
I did it in Sacramento before.
And I'm very interested in seeing 24-hour

00:09:41.290 --> 00:09:46.540
cities where people work and play and study
until close proximity.

00:09:46.540 --> 00:09:52.651
As far as the Plymouth, now, the reason why
I sold -- Ronald Reagan, he was the governor

00:09:52.651 --> 00:09:56.260
before me.
And he drove around or was driven around in

00:09:56.260 --> 00:10:00.020
a bullet-proof limousine that had belonged
to J. Edgar Hoover.

00:10:00.020 --> 00:10:04.710
I thought that would be a good thing to get
rid of.

00:10:04.710 --> 00:10:09.080
So that's -- there was a reason for that.
One time, my father -- we were in the -- we

00:10:09.080 --> 00:10:13.190
were in my father's limousine.
It was a Lincoln when he was governor.

00:10:13.190 --> 00:10:17.240
We went to the basketball game, the opening
of giants stadium.

00:10:17.240 --> 00:10:23.340
And the people in the crowd pounded on the
windows, they were yelling at my father because

00:10:23.340 --> 00:10:27.950
he was running into political difficulties
at the time.

00:10:27.950 --> 00:10:33.600
When all those people were pressing their
face and pounding on it, I said I was never

00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:37.530
going to drive in a limousine.
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: Talk about a formative event.

00:10:37.530 --> 00:10:41.990
&gt;&gt;Hon. Jerry Brown: I thought if I was in
a more modest car they wouldn't pound on the

00:10:41.990 --> 00:10:46.700
window in quite the same way.
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: In the 1980s, you gained a

00:10:46.700 --> 00:10:52.040
reputation of being quite a progressive.
And your opponents today are using this against

00:10:52.040 --> 00:10:55.910
you.
But, for example, in 1980, you talked about

00:10:55.910 --> 00:11:00.760
the need for universal health insurance.
And many other things that you tried to pioneer

00:11:00.760 --> 00:11:04.740
when you were governor.
Has your view of all of this changed?

00:11:04.740 --> 00:11:09.590
Do you still think you were right back then?
&gt;&gt;Hon. Jerry Brown: Well, certainly in the

00:11:09.590 --> 00:11:15.520
field of alternative energy, and I would say
that my thinking on efficiency and renewable

00:11:15.520 --> 00:11:22.080
energy was very much stimulated by the Arab
oil embargo, the recession of '73 and '74

00:11:22.080 --> 00:11:26.130
that was around this problem of excessive
energy use.

00:11:26.130 --> 00:11:32.280
So California, within eight years, became
the world leader in renewable energy.

00:11:32.280 --> 00:11:39.990
And if we count from then till now, Californians
have probably saved over $50 billion in energy

00:11:39.990 --> 00:11:43.800
efficiency because of our appliance standards
and the building standards.

00:11:43.800 --> 00:11:48.580
So I think those ideas are right on.
And at that time, we were talking about solar

00:11:48.580 --> 00:11:51.920
hot water.
Now we're talking about sort of photovoltaic.

00:11:51.920 --> 00:11:55.110
But it's the same thing, introduction of new
ideas.

00:11:55.110 --> 00:11:59.980
California is a state of imagination.
And imagination is what we need to get out

00:11:59.980 --> 00:12:02.690
of the bind.
We need to change the design.

00:12:02.690 --> 00:12:07.950
We need to introduce new ideas, and, quite
frankly, I've always been interested in the

00:12:07.950 --> 00:12:12.090
creative mind.
I had a teacher once that I put him on the

00:12:12.090 --> 00:12:15.310
Board of Regents.
And he inscribed one of the books he wrote,

00:12:15.310 --> 00:12:20.570
he said, "The new comes out of the random."
The new comes out of the random.

00:12:20.570 --> 00:12:24.160
I've been thinking a lot about that.
Some people think I am a little random.

00:12:24.160 --> 00:12:28.530
But unless you open the possibilities, you
rarely come up with something new.

00:12:28.530 --> 00:12:34.620
If you rigidly are programmed, if you're managing
what is, you can't create what really needs

00:12:34.620 --> 00:12:37.790
to be.
And that was the spirit then; I think it will

00:12:37.790 --> 00:12:41.010
be the spirit --
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: And then you ran for president

00:12:41.010 --> 00:12:44.940
a couple of times, three times.
And then, eventually, you ended up as mayor

00:12:44.940 --> 00:12:48.960
of Oakland.
And I suspect that of all of the public service

00:12:48.960 --> 00:12:54.930
roles you enjoyed, you probably enjoyed that
the most after figuring out how to do it.

00:12:54.930 --> 00:12:56.330
Is that true?
&gt;&gt;Hon. Jerry Brown: that is true.

00:12:56.330 --> 00:12:57.910
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: What was it like being mayor
of Oakland?

00:12:57.910 --> 00:13:00.810
&gt;&gt;Hon. Jerry Brown: Well, it was very different
than running for president -- running for

00:13:00.810 --> 00:13:03.180
mayor, that is.
And being mayor is very different than being

00:13:03.180 --> 00:13:06.070
governor.
You don't have to fly around in airplanes.

00:13:06.070 --> 00:13:10.310
Everything is within 15 minutes of where you
are.

00:13:10.310 --> 00:13:16.100
What's interesting about being mayor is, you're
in one place, and you really get to understand

00:13:16.100 --> 00:13:24.270
and know people, street corners, schools,
policemen, criminals, businesses.

00:13:24.270 --> 00:13:28.730
And I was able to go into the city, which
had a very undeveloped downtown, a lot of

00:13:28.730 --> 00:13:35.620
parking lots, a lot of crime, and actually
bring in thousands of people, thousands of

00:13:35.620 --> 00:13:42.810
new condominiums and apartments, new art galleries,
new businesses, an art school, restoration

00:13:42.810 --> 00:13:47.040
of the Fox theater.
So the downtown now is a very vital place.

00:13:47.040 --> 00:13:51.840
And what I really enjoyed about being mayor
of Oakland was to be able to revitalize the

00:13:51.840 --> 00:13:57.030
downtown next to the Bart.
So this Bart system that my father had started

00:13:57.030 --> 00:14:02.320
back in the sixties, all those many years,
now became the catalyst for revitalizing downtown

00:14:02.320 --> 00:14:07.230
Oakland, because it's only 12 minutes from
San Francisco and five minutes from Berkeley

00:14:07.230 --> 00:14:13.890
and 15 minutes from Walnut Creek.
So it became a hub, an urban village, with

00:14:13.890 --> 00:14:18.910
art galleries, with schools, with commercial
art theaters, and people living there.

00:14:18.910 --> 00:14:23.550
So building that, seeing stuff come out of
the ground, that's very exciting.

00:14:23.550 --> 00:14:29.090
As a governor, you're dealing with more laws
and bills and appointments, much longer-range,

00:14:29.090 --> 00:14:35.690
more abstract, and not the concrete change
and expression that you see as being a mayor

00:14:35.690 --> 00:14:38.780
of a city.
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: did you -- have your views

00:14:38.780 --> 00:14:43.270
on progressive issues changed much?
Because they don't seem to have -- if I look

00:14:43.270 --> 00:14:50.290
at your support for, for example, against
Prop. 8, I don't see much change in your views

00:14:50.290 --> 00:14:53.890
there.
Can you talk about A.B.32, Proposition 8,

00:14:53.890 --> 00:14:56.810
some of the big political issues that the
state faces.

00:14:56.810 --> 00:15:02.120
&gt;&gt;Hon. Jerry Brown: Well, certainly environment
was something that was really coming to the

00:15:02.120 --> 00:15:06.410
fore in the '70s.
Remember, Earth Day was 1970.

00:15:06.410 --> 00:15:09.790
The National Environmental Policy Act was
'69.

00:15:09.790 --> 00:15:12.990
The California Environmental Quality Act was
the same year.

00:15:12.990 --> 00:15:17.190
And this had all been put into effect under
Republican administrations.

00:15:17.190 --> 00:15:22.220
Reagan in California, Nixon in Washington.
And then when I came in in 1975, we really

00:15:22.220 --> 00:15:28.354
began to implement these principles.
And then, you know, the rubber hit the road

00:15:28.354 --> 00:15:33.230
and there was a lot of resistance.
But during my years, I really promoted renewable

00:15:33.230 --> 00:15:41.210
energy, protection of the coast, protection
of wild rivers, protection of the redwoods.

00:15:41.210 --> 00:15:49.339
All these different quality of life, ecosystem
questions came to the fore, and they really

00:15:49.339 --> 00:15:51.551
 -- I was in the spirit of California, the
spirit of the times.

00:15:51.551 --> 00:15:55.500
And I think today more than ever, these things
are salient.

00:15:55.500 --> 00:16:02.830
We now have climate change confronting us.
So I'd say, if anything, the issues that were

00:16:02.830 --> 00:16:12.080
more inchoate and embryonic in '75-'82 are
now in full force in their urgency and their

00:16:12.080 --> 00:16:15.950
importance.
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: When you think about how you're

00:16:15.950 --> 00:16:20.390
going to serve us as governor again -- and
as you pointed out, the state is six times

00:16:20.390 --> 00:16:28.590
larger, an enormous economic and cultural
force today -- but even the Terminator couldn't

00:16:28.590 --> 00:16:34.840
run this government.
The fundamental problems, as you know, have

00:16:34.840 --> 00:16:40.180
to do with an overreliance on higher-income
income tax, which is seasonal, right, in other

00:16:40.180 --> 00:16:45.450
words, up and down.
So the state goes from boom to bust; a highly,

00:16:45.450 --> 00:16:52.200
highly difficult redistricting, where the
seats are quite safe, there's very little

00:16:52.200 --> 00:16:58.190
competition for state seats; a requirement
for a balanced -- a budget agreement of two-thirds,

00:16:58.190 --> 00:17:03.490
which is only in four or five states and very
difficult to achieve in any political environment,

00:17:03.490 --> 00:17:07.600
but especially in the rancorous times when
we have little money and all of these state

00:17:07.600 --> 00:17:11.629
services and people coming to the trough,
all of the usual pressure groups and so forth.

00:17:11.629 --> 00:17:17.600
So when you think about that and you walk
into it now, what will you do differently?

00:17:17.600 --> 00:17:22.870
How will you approach it differently?
How will you not end up as the Terminator

00:17:22.870 --> 00:17:28.379
governor, Governor Schwarzenegger, who started
off with enormous public support, but unfortunately

00:17:28.379 --> 00:17:34.020
 -- and is a man I certainly respect -- is
now in approval ratings similar to that of

00:17:34.020 --> 00:17:36.350
Gray Davis, who you replaced?
&gt;&gt;Hon. Jerry Brown: Well, definitely, the

00:17:36.350 --> 00:17:40.370
legislature has about 15% approval.
The governor has 25%.

00:17:40.370 --> 00:17:48.700
And it's very hard to expect the people to
entrust too much responsibility to such discredited

00:17:48.700 --> 00:17:58.100
offices or officials.
And I think it's fair to say that approaching

00:17:58.100 --> 00:18:04.850
the government itself and the politics in
which it's embedded or in which it's enclosed,

00:18:04.850 --> 00:18:09.879
it does take knowledge.
If science requires training and preparation,

00:18:09.879 --> 00:18:16.450
if artistic production requires this, if business
requires this, I think you could say the same

00:18:16.450 --> 00:18:20.860
for this very different world of politics
and government.

00:18:20.860 --> 00:18:24.019
Some people say, well, this government is
just a business.

00:18:24.019 --> 00:18:28.330
You have good business experience.
But, actually, there's quite a bit of difference

00:18:28.330 --> 00:18:32.799
between being a CEO of business and being
a governor.

00:18:32.799 --> 00:18:38.200
First of all, a CEO often has very good relations
with the board of directors.

00:18:38.200 --> 00:18:41.120
Sometimes you get to -- get some of your key
people on the board.

00:18:41.120 --> 00:18:44.129
The board of directors for the governor is
the legislature.

00:18:44.129 --> 00:18:50.330
The legislature's independent, picked by the
people, and by constitutional provision and

00:18:50.330 --> 00:18:56.340
inclination, is out there checking, going
against, and really putting the pressure on.

00:18:56.340 --> 00:19:00.450
And you've got to woe, cajole, persuade.
You don't order.

00:19:00.450 --> 00:19:03.781
Secondly, in government, is, you can't fire
very many people.

00:19:03.781 --> 00:19:07.470
There's something called civil service.
People have a right to their job.

00:19:07.470 --> 00:19:10.889
Very hard to remove people.
Number two, you have collective bargaining.

00:19:10.889 --> 00:19:15.840
Every rule you're talking about has to be
embodied in a contract.

00:19:15.840 --> 00:19:20.389
Very different.
And then -- so you say, hey, I want to fire

00:19:20.389 --> 00:19:23.960
10,000 people.
No, it doesn't work that way.

00:19:23.960 --> 00:19:30.070
Third, lots of public exposure.
You can't deal with -- there's not too much

00:19:30.070 --> 00:19:33.399
privacy here.
This is an open, transparent venue.

00:19:33.399 --> 00:19:40.480
And that's why I think the -- mastering the
skills of public administration in the elective

00:19:40.480 --> 00:19:47.840
arena requires a great deal of patience, insight,
empathy, understanding, all the different

00:19:47.840 --> 00:19:50.299
points of view.
If you just think of it -- you mentioned Proposition

00:19:50.299 --> 00:19:53.380
8.
Sacramento has a representative from Kern

00:19:53.380 --> 00:19:58.669
County, that I think voted for Proposition
8 80%, and also has representatives from San

00:19:58.669 --> 00:20:02.009
Francisco that voted the opposite way.
And they're all there.

00:20:02.009 --> 00:20:05.240
And somehow you've got to get them all on
the same page.

00:20:05.240 --> 00:20:10.809
It takes skill, and it takes persuasion.
And then in working on the inside game, which

00:20:10.809 --> 00:20:19.590
is often deals, crafting these compromises,
but then out to the public, you have to inspire

00:20:19.590 --> 00:20:24.470
 -- you need dreams; you have to inspire.
You need an eloquence that is very different

00:20:24.470 --> 00:20:28.409
than the skill set for working in the corridors
of the capitol.

00:20:28.409 --> 00:20:32.909
So on balance, it just -- there's a lot to
learn.

00:20:32.909 --> 00:20:39.950
And I feel that -- I feel that getting the
training eight -- so long ago, then seeing

00:20:39.950 --> 00:20:43.600
the consequences of things that worked and
things that didn't work.

00:20:43.600 --> 00:20:47.370
I started a law called the Political Reform
Act of 1974.

00:20:47.370 --> 00:20:51.610
And when I was mayor, there was one of the
provisions that would have stopped me from

00:20:51.610 --> 00:20:55.460
promoting economic growth.
So I went to court and actually had part of

00:20:55.460 --> 00:20:59.820
the law that I wrote invalidated.
And I think it's a very salutory experience

00:20:59.820 --> 00:21:04.499
to both make laws and unmake them all in the
same lifetime.

00:21:04.499 --> 00:21:11.870
Because you see every law has unintended consequences.
So I think these are the ingredients that

00:21:11.870 --> 00:21:16.249
I've developed to make a very positive outcome.
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: What have you learned by being

00:21:16.249 --> 00:21:18.950
attorney general after being governor and
mayor?

00:21:18.950 --> 00:21:25.090
&gt;&gt;Hon. Jerry Brown: I've learned that often
the department heads and the governor don't

00:21:25.090 --> 00:21:31.850
know all the things that are going on.
There are these lawsuits, there's a number

00:21:31.850 --> 00:21:39.070
of areas in water and prisons and other areas.
And as attorney general, I have 1100 lawyers

00:21:39.070 --> 00:21:43.809
working, defending the state or doing other
kinds of legal actions.

00:21:43.809 --> 00:21:49.159
And, first of all, there's so many lawsuits.
There's so much complexity.

00:21:49.159 --> 00:21:54.350
And wrestling that stuff to the ground is
very challenging.

00:21:54.350 --> 00:22:00.299
And I think oftentimes the state makes agreements
that causes us to pay a lot of money later.

00:22:00.299 --> 00:22:04.790
We also see that sometimes the governor wants
to cut a budget, but then you find out people

00:22:04.790 --> 00:22:10.360
go to court and they get the cuts eliminated.
So you've got to know -- the laws are not

00:22:10.360 --> 00:22:14.370
only state laws, there are local laws, there's
the constitution, and there are the federal

00:22:14.370 --> 00:22:17.149
laws.
And we're enmeshed in all these contradictory

00:22:17.149 --> 00:22:22.850
commands.
And so moving through that complexity is something

00:22:22.850 --> 00:22:26.480
I didn't appreciate just how much of it there
was.

00:22:26.480 --> 00:22:32.159
And another thing I didn't appreciate as governor,
'cause each governor signs about 800 to 1,000

00:22:32.159 --> 00:22:37.459
new laws a year, and when you pass a law,
somebody's got to enforce that darned thing.

00:22:37.459 --> 00:22:42.559
It isn't just do good.
It's if you don't do good, you can get sued

00:22:42.559 --> 00:22:47.640
and go to jail or pay a tax.
And as attorney general, my office is often

00:22:47.640 --> 00:22:53.059
called upon to enforce these laws.
And businesses run afoul of many of them.

00:22:53.059 --> 00:22:56.340
And there's just tens of thousands of "thou
shalt not."

00:22:56.340 --> 00:23:06.129
And the density and the reach of the invasive,
minute prescriptions is breathtaking.

00:23:06.129 --> 00:23:09.990
And I've developed a very healthy distaste
for legislation.

00:23:09.990 --> 00:23:11.620
[ Laughter ]
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: Interesting.

00:23:11.620 --> 00:23:15.280
Speaking as a lawyer, governor, mayor, and
so forth.

00:23:15.280 --> 00:23:17.409
[ Applause ]
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: When you -- another question

00:23:17.409 --> 00:23:23.700
has to do with the maturation of your own
understanding of the role of public safety,

00:23:23.700 --> 00:23:28.460
because one of the things that you did when
you went into Oakland was, you helped fix

00:23:28.460 --> 00:23:34.090
some of the chronic crime problems.
As attorney general, you've obviously dealt

00:23:34.090 --> 00:23:42.010
with a very significant sort of prison union,
police forces and so forth, and CHP and so

00:23:42.010 --> 00:23:45.820
forth.
Do you have a view now of how you would manage

00:23:45.820 --> 00:23:51.909
the public safety functions of three strikes
you're out laws, the sum of all of those are

00:23:51.909 --> 00:23:55.950
a very large percentage of California's budget.
&gt;&gt;Hon. Jerry Brown: Right.

00:23:55.950 --> 00:24:02.090
The prison system -- you could say the crime,
you've got crime is, you have criminal law.

00:24:02.090 --> 00:24:06.669
And then you have local police for the cities,
you have county sheriffs.

00:24:06.669 --> 00:24:10.350
Then you have the highway patrol.
And then you have prisons.

00:24:10.350 --> 00:24:14.200
And then you have state parole.
So it's a big system.

00:24:14.200 --> 00:24:19.980
Just taking the state piece of that, which
is not the biggest, the prisons consume 10%

00:24:19.980 --> 00:24:24.179
of the state budget.
When I was governor, they consumed between

00:24:24.179 --> 00:24:30.369
2 and 3%.
So when you see a growth, call it 7%, 7% on

00:24:30.369 --> 00:24:34.679
a $100 billion budget is $7 billion.
That's a big difference.

00:24:34.679 --> 00:24:38.110
Then you say, what is it?
Well, you've got 160,000 people locked up.

00:24:38.110 --> 00:24:44.429
120,000 leave every year.
So every month, 10,000 people walk out the

00:24:44.429 --> 00:24:49.409
door and 10,000 people walk in.
It is the best-managed hotel system in the

00:24:49.409 --> 00:24:51.720
world.
There is never a vacant bed.

00:24:51.720 --> 00:24:58.240
Or a vacant cell, I should say.
And so the real question, people talk about

00:24:58.240 --> 00:25:02.529
reducing prison overcrowding.
The problem is, when you let them out, they

00:25:02.529 --> 00:25:08.440
want to come back, because the median educational
attainment is seventh grade.

00:25:08.440 --> 00:25:14.129
There's massive dope addiction.
There's a lot of anger.

00:25:14.129 --> 00:25:19.100
And there's almost no rehabilitation or experience
of work while they're in prison.

00:25:19.100 --> 00:25:22.880
The prisons are basically -- people are idle
for years.

00:25:22.880 --> 00:25:28.960
Once when I was young, I was told that idleness
is the devil's workshop.

00:25:28.960 --> 00:25:33.289
Well, the devil has a lot of workshops in
California, like, 33 massive prisons where

00:25:33.289 --> 00:25:38.399
tens of thousands of men, very vigorous, very
energetic are sitting around doing nothing.

00:25:38.399 --> 00:25:44.060
I believe that work in prison, more education,
more drug treatment, re-entry, I think we

00:25:44.060 --> 00:25:50.450
can restructure the way the criminal justice
and crime control and prison and incarceration

00:25:50.450 --> 00:25:54.669
and sanctioned system work.
And I think we can save money.

00:25:54.669 --> 00:25:58.611
And I think we can improve public safety and
we can increase the productivity of all the

00:25:58.611 --> 00:26:02.860
individuals involved.
But it takes -- it takes knowing, understanding,

00:26:02.860 --> 00:26:07.649
and being focused.
Because the crime-prison is only one issue.

00:26:07.649 --> 00:26:12.230
You have the taxes and budget, and then you
have water, and then you have schools, and

00:26:12.230 --> 00:26:15.440
then you have highways, and then you have
the high-speed rail.

00:26:15.440 --> 00:26:18.710
All these things are pretty -- there's a lot
of complexity there.

00:26:18.710 --> 00:26:23.869
And that's why I say it's really important
to spend the time understanding the different

00:26:23.869 --> 00:26:29.769
key elements of what goes into the government
structure so you know where to go at -- what

00:26:29.769 --> 00:26:34.200
you need to do to get real change.
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: When you look at the scale

00:26:34.200 --> 00:26:37.529
of the budget, education is actually a huge
part of what we're trying to do.

00:26:37.529 --> 00:26:42.450
&gt;&gt;Hon. Jerry Brown: The biggest part.
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: And as you know, there are

00:26:42.450 --> 00:26:43.980
a series of initiatives that require massive
spending on education.

00:26:43.980 --> 00:26:48.720
Many people believe that there's a very, very
strong teacher's union involved as well.

00:26:48.720 --> 00:26:53.940
How will you change California education -- I
know you're interested in, for example, public

00:26:53.940 --> 00:26:59.179
charter schools.
How will you make it different as one of the

00:26:59.179 --> 00:27:02.610
biggest issues California faces?
&gt;&gt;Hon. Jerry Brown: Well, I want to say something

00:27:02.610 --> 00:27:07.279
about the teachers' union or the California
teachers' association, California federation

00:27:07.279 --> 00:27:12.789
of teachers.
I have two charter schools that do not have

00:27:12.789 --> 00:27:21.440
tenure, and there's no union representative.
And yet we are highly challenged to produce

00:27:21.440 --> 00:27:23.780
the high scores that we're looking for.
We're doing very well.

00:27:23.780 --> 00:27:26.499
The schools are doing excellent in college
admission.

00:27:26.499 --> 00:27:30.960
But, for example, in mathematics, in the military
school, last year --

00:27:30.960 --> 00:27:33.600
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: The Oakland military school.
&gt;&gt;Hon. Jerry Brown: The Oakland military school,

00:27:33.600 --> 00:27:35.909
I formed the Oakland Military Institute, 500
kids, sixth grade through twelfth.

00:27:35.909 --> 00:27:38.739
And the Oakland School for the Arts, sixth
grade through twelfth.

00:27:38.739 --> 00:27:45.009
Well, in the military school, we're still
around 20% proficient in math, and yet we

00:27:45.009 --> 00:27:49.999
can hire any math teacher we want.
We have after-school, we have Saturday class.

00:27:49.999 --> 00:27:57.970
There are embedded challenges, deficiencies
in low-income neighborhoods, low-income families

00:27:57.970 --> 00:28:04.429
where the income is very unstable, very inadequate,
lots of stress, gangs in the neighborhood,

00:28:04.429 --> 00:28:09.090
and when you translate that into the development
of the thinking of the kids, they come into

00:28:09.090 --> 00:28:12.179
school, it's pretty hard to get them interested
in algebra.

00:28:12.179 --> 00:28:16.639
The motivation is a big challenge.
So you've got to attract the teachers, particularly

00:28:16.639 --> 00:28:19.190
math and science teachers.
You have to motivate them.

00:28:19.190 --> 00:28:24.940
You have to hold students and kids to account,
because they have to take responsibility.

00:28:24.940 --> 00:28:28.489
And you have to have that bond between teacher
and student.

00:28:28.489 --> 00:28:33.129
And there's a lot of focus on national standards,
on data collection.

00:28:33.129 --> 00:28:39.059
But teaching is a mentoring kind of relationship.
It's one human being, the teacher, and these

00:28:39.059 --> 00:28:43.909
students.
And the relationship, the exchange, the identification,

00:28:43.909 --> 00:28:49.620
that's crucial in stimulating learning.
And I think we're losing a lot of that humanistic

00:28:49.620 --> 00:28:55.429
aspect of education as we try to find mechanistic
ways of producing outcomes.

00:28:55.429 --> 00:29:04.389
There's a lot of fashion in education.
The waves of reform keep occurring over -- and

00:29:04.389 --> 00:29:07.440
I've seen them over the last 30 years.
I think we have to focus on the basics.

00:29:07.440 --> 00:29:10.919
You have to have discipline in the schools,
you need inspiration.

00:29:10.919 --> 00:29:16.340
You have to find where the kids are emotionally
and intellectually, and move them along in

00:29:16.340 --> 00:29:22.149
a sequential, accountable way.
So I really feel the experience I've had in

00:29:22.149 --> 00:29:28.669
starting these two schools from scratch, developing
the leaders, getting rid of the ones who didn't

00:29:28.669 --> 00:29:33.509
work, and getting new ones over and over again,
seeing the parents, and I've learned a great

00:29:33.509 --> 00:29:36.989
deal.
And I think, for example, the theme, a school

00:29:36.989 --> 00:29:42.169
based on art, a school based on the military
school framework, leadership, competition,

00:29:42.169 --> 00:29:46.230
espirit de corpse.
There can be other themes: Hospitality industry,

00:29:46.230 --> 00:29:52.309
math and science.
I think we need to give an overall thematic

00:29:52.309 --> 00:29:59.149
context so that every kid in the school knows
what's expected and identifies with it and

00:29:59.149 --> 00:30:02.820
chooses it so that there will be other choices
in the school district where they can go.

00:30:02.820 --> 00:30:07.610
So I'm confident that California can make
real progress in education.

00:30:07.610 --> 00:30:14.590
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: I'd like to talk a little
bit about the election.

00:30:14.590 --> 00:30:20.610
Today, there are two primary Republican challengers.
It appears as though you're the only significant

00:30:20.610 --> 00:30:24.159
candidate for the Democratic primary.
&gt;&gt;Hon. Jerry Brown: By the way, that was not

00:30:24.159 --> 00:30:27.830
of my own choosing.
I certainly was looking forward to a lot more

00:30:27.830 --> 00:30:29.049
candidates.
But they all went away.

00:30:29.049 --> 00:30:37.179
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: They all went away.
And so it looks like you'll be the Democratic

00:30:37.179 --> 00:30:43.809
nominee, conventional wisdom.
And you have been relatively careful about

00:30:43.809 --> 00:30:48.870
getting started.
You face an extremely well-funded opponent

00:30:48.870 --> 00:30:54.230
in Meg Whitman.
And Steve Poizner, of course, we'll see next

00:30:54.230 --> 00:30:57.409
week.
What's the plan to win for you?

00:30:57.409 --> 00:31:03.200
&gt;&gt;Hon. Jerry Brown: Well, the plan to win
is not to waste scarce campaign funds.

00:31:03.200 --> 00:31:10.230
I've been hard at work at this, work at the
fund-raising, work at developing a campaign

00:31:10.230 --> 00:31:15.179
team, holding down expenses.
Certainly the way one runs a campaign might

00:31:15.179 --> 00:31:20.450
be an indication how one would run government.
And I run a very frugal operation.

00:31:20.450 --> 00:31:23.340
I think --
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: Well, I called -- I called

00:31:23.340 --> 00:31:25.239
your office, and you answered the phone.
That's frugal.

00:31:25.239 --> 00:31:27.550
[ Laughter ]
&gt;&gt;Hon. Jerry Brown: I don't -- we have more

00:31:27.550 --> 00:31:29.169
people -- we have a lot of people now.
We're --

00:31:29.169 --> 00:31:30.869
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: Maybe you were doing the lunch
phone --

00:31:30.869 --> 00:31:33.769
&gt;&gt;Hon. Jerry Brown: I'll pick up the phone,
because if it rings more than twice, I don't

00:31:33.769 --> 00:31:35.859
like that.
I want a prompt response.

00:31:35.859 --> 00:31:38.019
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: I'm not making this up, by
the way.

00:31:38.019 --> 00:31:40.580
&gt;&gt;Hon. Jerry Brown: I'm always interested
who's calling.

00:31:40.580 --> 00:31:45.460
But -- So I've got a day job, called the attorney
general.

00:31:45.460 --> 00:31:48.250
We have a lot of issues.
We have antitrust issues.

00:31:48.250 --> 00:31:50.929
We have environment issues.
We have criminal issues.

00:31:50.929 --> 00:31:54.809
We have gang problems.
You have prescription drugs, underground economy.

00:31:54.809 --> 00:31:56.179
A lot of things.
I'm working on that.

00:31:56.179 --> 00:31:58.360
And I have to raise the money.
I don't just go write a check.

00:31:58.360 --> 00:32:02.809
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: What's the money situation.
&gt;&gt;Hon. Jerry Brown: I have about 15 and a

00:32:02.809 --> 00:32:05.519
half million dollars in the bank.
I need to raise many millions more.

00:32:05.519 --> 00:32:09.249
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: Why do you need so much money?
&gt;&gt;Hon. Jerry Brown: Because the focal point

00:32:09.249 --> 00:32:13.279
of campaigning are television ads, for the
most part.

00:32:13.279 --> 00:32:17.570
And the ads are enormously expensive.
They cost you $100,000 for one ad.

00:32:17.570 --> 00:32:21.471
And the key in the election are the decline-to-state
voters.

00:32:21.471 --> 00:32:28.370
And they often are not reading editorials,
political journals, but they are watching

00:32:28.370 --> 00:32:32.480
a sporting event, an entertainment show, the
Olympics.

00:32:32.480 --> 00:32:37.859
If one can buy a commercial and then you send
your message to that person without even asking

00:32:37.859 --> 00:32:42.519
their permission, over time, you get your
favorable impression over.

00:32:42.519 --> 00:32:47.409
And so a great deal, if not the predominant
part, of the campaign will be through the

00:32:47.409 --> 00:32:51.179
mechanism of TV commercials.
Now, that's not the only story.

00:32:51.179 --> 00:32:56.619
There's the press, both written and electronic.
There's the Internet.

00:32:56.619 --> 00:33:01.419
There's people-to-people meetings.
And over time, not in the month of April,

00:33:01.419 --> 00:33:06.230
but between April and November, there will
be a lot of back and forth among the candidates.

00:33:06.230 --> 00:33:10.460
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: But when does that happen?
It seems to me that people are not engaged

00:33:10.460 --> 00:33:13.090
today in the governor's race for something
 --

00:33:13.090 --> 00:33:17.929
&gt;&gt;Hon. Jerry Brown: But you can't ask people
to be engaged every day or even every week

00:33:17.929 --> 00:33:23.619
between now and November.
It reaches a crescendo September, October,

00:33:23.619 --> 00:33:25.960
leading up to the election.
That's always the way it is.

00:33:25.960 --> 00:33:30.499
The interest level -- now, there are political
junkies that are following, on the Internet

00:33:30.499 --> 00:33:34.559
every day reading about this stuff.
But that's a very small subset of the number

00:33:34.559 --> 00:33:35.559
of people that are going to --
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: But are you going to do a

00:33:35.559 --> 00:33:36.559
debate?
&gt;&gt;Hon. Jerry Brown: Well, I'd love to do debates.

00:33:36.559 --> 00:33:40.019
I hope that will be possible.
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: So when will the debates be?

00:33:40.019 --> 00:33:45.369
&gt;&gt;Hon. Jerry Brown: I would tend to think
the debates will be in the fall.

00:33:45.369 --> 00:33:51.470
What happens now, in April and May, unless
it's pretty earth-shaking, is not going to

00:33:51.470 --> 00:33:55.190
shape the thinking of people in September
and October.

00:33:55.190 --> 00:33:59.179
And there will be changes in the budget, there
will be changes in the -- in the world events

00:33:59.179 --> 00:34:03.429
and news in Washington.
And all that affects the conversation and

00:34:03.429 --> 00:34:09.690
the debate in the campaign.
So my thought is very deliberate, well-paced

00:34:09.690 --> 00:34:16.650
campaign, not wasting unnecessary money.
I mean, these other candidates, I mean, I

00:34:16.650 --> 00:34:21.560
think Whitman has spent already $50 million.
I think Steve has spent three or four million.

00:34:21.560 --> 00:34:24.640
That's an enormous sum of money.
I've spent probably 500,000.

00:34:24.640 --> 00:34:31.710
But I think the -- the spending needs to be
modulated to -- for the biggest bang for the

00:34:31.710 --> 00:34:33.390
buck.
And I think we'll get that.

00:34:33.390 --> 00:34:37.730
And it will be not only on testing, it'll
be on Internet, it'll be people-to-people,

00:34:37.730 --> 00:34:43.510
and it'll be through the medium of public
debate, both by -- in a forum like this, but

00:34:43.510 --> 00:34:48.790
also across the airwaves.
She says, he says, and back and forth.

00:34:48.790 --> 00:34:57.630
All that creates news and facts and factoids
that will allow people to make their own decision.

00:34:57.630 --> 00:35:02.260
I'm confident that by the time of the election
in November, people will have enough information

00:35:02.260 --> 00:35:07.140
to decide which candidate is on their side,
which candidate is going to fight for their

00:35:07.140 --> 00:35:12.810
interests, and who do they most identify with.
And so I'm not at all concerned that there

00:35:12.810 --> 00:35:16.881
will be a lack of information.
If anything, there will be a surfeit of information.

00:35:16.881 --> 00:35:18.910
And people will be tired of it and want to
turn it off.

00:35:18.910 --> 00:35:19.910
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: Why don't we get some questions
from the audience and get our audience to

00:35:19.910 --> 00:35:30.690
participate as well.
We have mikes here.

00:35:30.690 --> 00:35:38.620
My final question is, in the craft of politics
and of getting yourself elected, it's -- you're

00:35:38.620 --> 00:35:44.390
saying it's not going to be enough to just
have the Democratic party, the Democratic

00:35:44.390 --> 00:35:47.350
voters.
Is that a change from your first 1970s?

00:35:47.350 --> 00:35:56.080
&gt;&gt;Hon. Jerry Brown: Well, the decline-of-state
voters when I ran for governor was, I believe,

00:35:56.080 --> 00:35:59.260
no more than 3%.
It's now 20%.

00:35:59.260 --> 00:36:05.380
But even registered Democrats and registered
Republicans are not totally committed to their

00:36:05.380 --> 00:36:08.290
party.
So I think if you want to look at it just

00:36:08.290 --> 00:36:16.540
schematically, you can be confident that 85
to 90 -- 80 to 90% of the Republicans are

00:36:16.540 --> 00:36:24.040
going to vote for the Republican candidate.
80 to 90% of Democrats will vote for the Democratic

00:36:24.040 --> 00:36:26.620
candidate.
There's a marginal group in both parties that

00:36:26.620 --> 00:36:30.930
could move back and forth based on the campaign
and based on what they read and see.

00:36:30.930 --> 00:36:35.880
Then you have this group in the middle, the
decline to state, which often don't have as

00:36:35.880 --> 00:36:42.410
much interest as the committed people.
And their focus will emerge as we get closer

00:36:42.410 --> 00:36:45.270
to the election.
But they will be decisive.

00:36:45.270 --> 00:36:52.620
And their concerns are not the -- you know,
the excitement of the base as we call it,

00:36:52.620 --> 00:36:58.690
the hard-core Republican, the strong Democrat.
No, this decline to state is more skeptical,

00:36:58.690 --> 00:37:05.360
more dubious of government, and they're the
ones who will ultimately decide who the next

00:37:05.360 --> 00:37:06.500
governor is.
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: Let's take our first question.

00:37:06.500 --> 00:37:10.830
Let me remind you all that you're on the record.
Yes, sir.

00:37:10.830 --> 00:37:13.390
&gt;&gt;&gt; Eric asked a question about the state's
governability.

00:37:13.390 --> 00:37:18.610
And your response was about your knowledge
of inside baseball.

00:37:18.610 --> 00:37:25.180
I wonder if there's anything about the -- anything
structural about the way the state is governed

00:37:25.180 --> 00:37:29.130
that you would be inclined to change.
And if there is, what would you do?

00:37:29.130 --> 00:37:32.130
&gt;&gt;Hon. Jerry Brown: I'm glad you gave me a
chance to elaborate on that.

00:37:32.130 --> 00:37:37.540
The -- There is this two-thirds vote.
But the two-thirds vote existed when my father

00:37:37.540 --> 00:37:40.390
was governor, when Reagan was governor, when
Warren was governor.

00:37:40.390 --> 00:37:44.850
It wasn't that big of an impediment.
There's something else going on.

00:37:44.850 --> 00:37:51.540
The polarization between different groups
in the society as expressed in the two parties

00:37:51.540 --> 00:37:56.600
is much sharper, much more antagonistic.
And that's true at the national level, it's

00:37:56.600 --> 00:37:59.760
true at the state level.
Something is going on in the society.

00:37:59.760 --> 00:38:03.520
Perhaps it's the slowdown in growth, zero-sum
game.

00:38:03.520 --> 00:38:08.190
People aren't as accommodating.
And that's just another barrier.

00:38:08.190 --> 00:38:13.440
But I do believe that at the end of the day,
people think -- enough people think, including

00:38:13.440 --> 00:38:19.070
legislators, of California first.
I think they see themselves as individuals,

00:38:19.070 --> 00:38:23.280
as members of a larger community than just
their partisan affiliation.

00:38:23.280 --> 00:38:28.170
And that's what I would work on.
So it isn't just the two-thirds vote or the

00:38:28.170 --> 00:38:34.390
reapportionment or one of those things.
So we can make some changes.

00:38:34.390 --> 00:38:38.160
There's a reapportionment commission, there's
a vote to make the primaries open.

00:38:38.160 --> 00:38:40.730
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: Are you, in fact, worried
about the reapportionment commission.

00:38:40.730 --> 00:38:45.800
As we know, it's private citizens.
&gt;&gt;Hon. Jerry Brown: I'm not worried about

00:38:45.800 --> 00:38:50.220
it at all.
They say legislation is like making, you know,

00:38:50.220 --> 00:38:54.530
salami or bologna.
I think the reapportion will have some of

00:38:54.530 --> 00:38:59.000
the same characteristics.
The fact is, people are grouping themselves.

00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:03.370
People in Bakersfield think differently than
people in San Francisco.

00:39:03.370 --> 00:39:07.610
And people in Orange County think differently
than people in Alameda County.

00:39:07.610 --> 00:39:14.420
There's a grouping of like, for whatever reasons.
And see even if you redivide the legislative

00:39:14.420 --> 00:39:17.880
pie in different ways, I don't think there
will be a big difference.

00:39:17.880 --> 00:39:22.210
There may be three or four seats.
But, generally, we have the same problem.

00:39:22.210 --> 00:39:28.490
There's more spending than there is revenues.
There's a north and south dispute on water.

00:39:28.490 --> 00:39:34.570
There's differences on what education should
be, on the criminal law, labor relations.

00:39:34.570 --> 00:39:39.100
These are still built in.
And reapportion, I think, will have some impact.

00:39:39.100 --> 00:39:40.731
But it's not decisive.
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: Yes, sir.

00:39:40.731 --> 00:39:46.460
&gt;&gt;&gt; Can you discuss your vision for the future
of college education in California.

00:39:46.460 --> 00:39:52.610
&gt;&gt;Hon. Jerry Brown: Yeah.
My -- my vision is more abundant college education.

00:39:52.610 --> 00:39:57.610
The -- my father was governor, he was able
to build three new universities.

00:39:57.610 --> 00:40:03.400
It was virtually free.
And now tuition increases, elimination of

00:40:03.400 --> 00:40:07.290
courses.
I think we have to maintain a very powerful

00:40:07.290 --> 00:40:11.971
commitment to higher education, as well as
making sure the kids are prepared to get there.

00:40:11.971 --> 00:40:18.380
And that is the engine of growth.
It's also the foundation of citizenship and

00:40:18.380 --> 00:40:22.490
our community.
So I can't think of anything much more important

00:40:22.490 --> 00:40:29.120
than a vibrant, accessible university system.
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: The issue, just to make clear,

00:40:29.120 --> 00:40:33.832
is that both the college -- community system,
as well as the U.C. system, of which you were

00:40:33.832 --> 00:40:37.250
the chairman of the board and would become
the chairman of the board again, are really

00:40:37.250 --> 00:40:39.100
very, very seriously hit by the cut backs
right now.

00:40:39.100 --> 00:40:41.770
&gt;&gt;Hon. Jerry Brown: They are hit.
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: It really does affect them.

00:40:41.770 --> 00:40:46.110
&gt;&gt;Hon. Jerry Brown: Here -- so let's -- it's
good to kind of compare what happens over

00:40:46.110 --> 00:40:48.860
time.
When you look at a problem today, it's helpful

00:40:48.860 --> 00:40:54.420
to see what were the ingredients over time
that have constituted the problem.

00:40:54.420 --> 00:41:01.150
Today, as I said, the prison spending is 10,
not 2 or 3.

00:41:01.150 --> 00:41:07.330
The spending on the health care for the poor,
our Medi-Cal program, that's around 18% of

00:41:07.330 --> 00:41:09.170
the budget.
Used to be 10.

00:41:09.170 --> 00:41:12.220
So if you take those two, you're talking about
15%.

00:41:12.220 --> 00:41:19.970
15% on a 100 billion -- that's 12 to $15 billion
that now is going to something that it didn't

00:41:19.970 --> 00:41:24.120
go to 30 years ago.
So I think we have to find savings in those

00:41:24.120 --> 00:41:27.830
programs, and we have to find -- we have to
reprioritize.

00:41:27.830 --> 00:41:34.000
Because there is -- part of our duty is to
take care of those who are less fortunate

00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:38.740
and very vulnerable.
And the other part of our responsibility,

00:41:38.740 --> 00:41:44.750
very, very important, is to stimulate new
thinking, new ideas, skill sets, imagination.

00:41:44.750 --> 00:41:49.790
And there has to be the right balance.
Because unless we're inventing and designing

00:41:49.790 --> 00:41:55.130
the new, then we're stagnating.
But if we're completely oblivious to the vulnerable,

00:41:55.130 --> 00:41:59.990
then we're a very harsh society.
So that's where I think wisdom comes in.

00:41:59.990 --> 00:42:02.680
&gt;&gt;&gt; Attorney General Brown, thanks so much
for coming and sharing your thoughts with

00:42:02.680 --> 00:42:05.680
us.
Can you discuss the impact that the ballot

00:42:05.680 --> 00:42:09.921
initiative process has had on the governability
of California, particularly since Prop. 13,

00:42:09.921 --> 00:42:13.410
which was passed around your time as governor.
&gt;&gt;Hon. Jerry Brown: Yeah, Prop. 13 passed

00:42:13.410 --> 00:42:17.980
in '78.
By the way, it attracted the highest turnout

00:42:17.980 --> 00:42:26.230
ever for a state primary election.
And since that time, almost right afterwards,

00:42:26.230 --> 00:42:33.780
one ballot measure after another constraining
the governor, the legislature, setting down

00:42:33.780 --> 00:42:38.130
more and more precise rules on how things
need to be done.

00:42:38.130 --> 00:42:45.140
So what you have here is, you have a chess
game of government with fewer and fewer moves.

00:42:45.140 --> 00:42:52.690
And that is driven by the frustration.
So people have a widespread disgust at their

00:42:52.690 --> 00:42:58.260
rep- -- at the mechanism of representation.
So people then put on the ballot, often special

00:42:58.260 --> 00:43:02.780
interests, some attractive-sounding measure.
And people vote for it.

00:43:02.780 --> 00:43:10.540
But the more they embed the system with these
constraints, the more difficult it is to perform,

00:43:10.540 --> 00:43:16.280
and the performance declines, and people want
more and more initiatives to correct it.

00:43:16.280 --> 00:43:19.800
So we're in a cycle, a rather destructive
cycle.

00:43:19.800 --> 00:43:25.920
And to get out of that, first of all, we need
to get beyond that.

00:43:25.920 --> 00:43:31.410
And I think the way we need to get beyond
it is to make the governing process more transparent,

00:43:31.410 --> 00:43:39.780
to make the key elements of government, the
education, higher and K-12, the prison system,

00:43:39.780 --> 00:43:45.610
the water, the energy, the roads, the medical
care, make those key elements transparent,

00:43:45.610 --> 00:43:51.680
accessible, understandable so people know,
what are their tax dollars going for, what

00:43:51.680 --> 00:43:55.410
is it doing, and where are the areas where
we can modify.

00:43:55.410 --> 00:44:02.790
And, quite frankly, I think I can conduct
that kind of transparent process that will

00:44:02.790 --> 00:44:08.310
reconnect the citizenry to their own government,
something that I think has very much been

00:44:08.310 --> 00:44:12.569
lost in recent years.
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: Go ahead.

00:44:12.569 --> 00:44:15.912
&gt;&gt;&gt; Hello.
When you are talking about education, you

00:44:15.912 --> 00:44:17.780
talked a lot about your philosophy and about
the teacher-student connection.

00:44:17.780 --> 00:44:24.400
You mentioned a little bit about the union.
I would like to -- could you be a little more

00:44:24.400 --> 00:44:29.420
specific about how that would translate into
your actions as a governor.

00:44:29.420 --> 00:44:33.640
Would you push policies against standardized
testing, for example?

00:44:33.640 --> 00:44:36.560
Or how would you interact with the teachers'
union?

00:44:36.560 --> 00:44:41.030
How would it affect -- and how important is
it to you?

00:44:41.030 --> 00:44:43.370
How would it affect your policies and what
you'd do as a governor?

00:44:43.370 --> 00:44:51.150
&gt;&gt;Hon. Jerry Brown: Yeah, I do think that
this rush to national standards needs to be

00:44:51.150 --> 00:44:56.250
carefully evaluated.
California has had a testing -- and national

00:44:56.250 --> 00:44:59.640
test.
There are more and more tests.

00:44:59.640 --> 00:45:05.220
We treat third-graders almost like we do young
lawyers taking the bar review -- bar test.

00:45:05.220 --> 00:45:10.930
Three days, intense, there's SAT tests, the
state tests.

00:45:10.930 --> 00:45:16.420
Then you have your normally tests in the classroom.
So we need balance here.

00:45:16.420 --> 00:45:22.670
And it's well to remember, by the way, that
30 years ago, there was virtually no talk

00:45:22.670 --> 00:45:28.570
of national standards, national tests, pay
for performance.

00:45:28.570 --> 00:45:33.500
These are all kind of in ideas.
And we ought to test those ideas before we

00:45:33.500 --> 00:45:39.230
adopt them wholesale.
So I do think that variety, we all learn in

00:45:39.230 --> 00:45:47.100
different ways, imagination is crucial for
 -- and people learn and unfold in their lives

00:45:47.100 --> 00:45:50.410
differently, and different people are interested
in different things.

00:45:50.410 --> 00:45:56.401
So, yes, we need some core standards.
But I think the states ought to have wide

00:45:56.401 --> 00:46:01.870
latitude in what they develop.
I think schools also need -- you can't let

00:46:01.870 --> 00:46:09.560
the curriculum be colonized by whatever the
fashion of the moment is in requiring these

00:46:09.560 --> 00:46:15.450
tests, and the data from the test, then judging
the teachers, it becomes a very centralized

00:46:15.450 --> 00:46:19.220
and rigid system.
And I think decentralization is very important.

00:46:19.220 --> 00:46:26.200
And the tolerance of disparate outcomes.
And I think through competition, through transparency,

00:46:26.200 --> 00:46:31.830
people will gravitate to what is best.
But I do think the humanistic tradition is

00:46:31.830 --> 00:46:40.280
being lost.
Schools were conceived not as workforce factories

00:46:40.280 --> 00:46:48.240
creating, you know, inputs to the workforce,
but they were seen as places where disparate

00:46:48.240 --> 00:46:54.450
Americans could come together and learn the
common experience of what it is to be American

00:46:54.450 --> 00:46:58.650
and what it is to be a citizen.
And when you look at the gang problem in certain

00:46:58.650 --> 00:47:03.670
schools, as well as the failure rate, you
find out that citizenship and morality and

00:47:03.670 --> 00:47:11.250
ethics is quite deficient on the agenda.
So, yes, basic reading, math, science, legislature,

00:47:11.250 --> 00:47:17.560
all those skills and the pathway to higher
education, very important.

00:47:17.560 --> 00:47:22.570
But you -- still, at the end of the day, from
the time of Thomas Jefferson, we've always

00:47:22.570 --> 00:47:26.730
assumed that a democracy can't work without
an informed citizenry.

00:47:26.730 --> 00:47:33.480
And critical thinking as well as basic common
values are the mission of the public school,

00:47:33.480 --> 00:47:38.220
and equally as important to some of the more
recent demands that are being put on it.

00:47:38.220 --> 00:47:40.180
Yeah.
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: Let's go ahead.

00:47:40.180 --> 00:47:41.180
Next question.
&gt;&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:47:41.180 --> 00:47:47.040
What are your thoughts on the calls for a
constitutional convention?

00:47:47.040 --> 00:47:55.190
&gt;&gt;Hon. Jerry Brown: I think the convention
could be a vehicle to either -- as another

00:47:55.190 --> 00:48:02.480
step in the debate in resolving some of these
California challenges, for example, the absolute

00:48:02.480 --> 00:48:10.480
embedded gap between revenue and spending.
So at some point, a convention might be the

00:48:10.480 --> 00:48:16.260
vehicle to carry on the next level of the
debate.

00:48:16.260 --> 00:48:21.470
What do we really want as Californians?
What kind of a budget, what -- what is our

00:48:21.470 --> 00:48:23.240
government?
What should it be?

00:48:23.240 --> 00:48:27.630
And that's not a decision for one person or
120 people.

00:48:27.630 --> 00:48:31.570
It's really, in a democracy, for the people
themselves.

00:48:31.570 --> 00:48:38.400
And then the problem becomes how do we facilitate
that collective debate and ultimately collective

00:48:38.400 --> 00:48:42.140
decision?
The legislature is the key arena for that.

00:48:42.140 --> 00:48:47.080
Initiatives also play a role.
But given the break down where we are, it

00:48:47.080 --> 00:48:53.550
might require at some point a convention to
take the next step in resolving some of these

00:48:53.550 --> 00:48:56.580
tough issues.
I don't think they can all be resolved in

00:48:56.580 --> 00:48:59.650
the legislature alone.
At some point, the people are going to have

00:48:59.650 --> 00:49:05.050
to weigh in on what kind of a California future
do they want and what role do they see the

00:49:05.050 --> 00:49:08.933
government playing in that.
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: do you think it will happen

00:49:08.933 --> 00:49:09.933
when you're governor?
&gt;&gt;Hon. Jerry Brown: It could.

00:49:09.933 --> 00:49:12.680
It could.
And it's certainly a mechanism that I'm looking

00:49:12.680 --> 00:49:21.840
at, not as the first line of attack on the
stalemate and the breakdown, but as, certainly,

00:49:21.840 --> 00:49:25.610
a real-live possibility of something that
should be seriously entertained.

00:49:25.610 --> 00:49:27.420
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: So we have -- we're running
out of time.

00:49:27.420 --> 00:49:30.520
We have three more questions.
Let's have these be the last.

00:49:30.520 --> 00:49:33.040
Yes, sir, go ahead.
&gt;&gt;&gt; Taxes in California.

00:49:33.040 --> 00:49:38.660
Do you think we're taxing about the right
level, taxing too much, taxing too little

00:49:38.660 --> 00:49:40.850
and what do you think will happen under your
administration?

00:49:40.850 --> 00:49:48.300
&gt;&gt;Hon. Jerry Brown: Well, if past is prologue,
when I was governor, contrary to what you

00:49:48.300 --> 00:49:53.250
might see in some of these ads, there was
never an increase in the sales tax, the income

00:49:53.250 --> 00:50:00.220
tax during my years -- or the gas tax, wine
tax, any of this.

00:50:00.220 --> 00:50:05.300
We were blessed with a lot of vibrant economy.
Created 1.9 million jobs.

00:50:05.300 --> 00:50:11.800
Today, we're in trouble.
And I've said there will be no new taxes unless

00:50:11.800 --> 00:50:15.420
the people themselves want them and vote for
them.

00:50:15.420 --> 00:50:21.380
And that's part of the larger question of
what do we really need to be doing in government

00:50:21.380 --> 00:50:26.150
and how do we resolve these very sharp disputes?
Because there are very different views on

00:50:26.150 --> 00:50:28.090
this.
And that's where I would like to see a very

00:50:28.090 --> 00:50:32.910
transparent process that enables the people
of this state to make decision.

00:50:32.910 --> 00:50:38.490
And at some point in the legislative process,
we may well have to go to the people and get

00:50:38.490 --> 00:50:45.230
their view of how to resolve the budget gap.
But I think the first line of attack here

00:50:45.230 --> 00:50:49.720
is to make the most efficient government,
not to try to do it all in one year.

00:50:49.720 --> 00:50:55.930
I mean, when you're facing -- a lot of what
we're missing now in terms of funding came

00:50:55.930 --> 00:51:04.650
from the Wall Street debacle, the disappearance
today, measured today in real terms, of 11

00:51:04.650 --> 00:51:10.460
 -- over $11 trillion in wealth.
That was destroyed out of this mortgage debacle,

00:51:10.460 --> 00:51:13.760
the securitization of all the subprime mortgages
and what have you.

00:51:13.760 --> 00:51:20.970
That unregulated Wall Street outcome is now
causing suffering all over the world, including

00:51:20.970 --> 00:51:28.680
states, cities, and school districts.
So we shouldn't punish or diminish the important

00:51:28.680 --> 00:51:34.150
work of schooling and health care and research
and development in universities because we

00:51:34.150 --> 00:51:39.520
had this excess of the debt-driven and fueled
bubble.

00:51:39.520 --> 00:51:44.800
I think we have to take time, take two or
three years, or maybe longer, to work, to

00:51:44.800 --> 00:51:50.430
finance a workout where we bring revenue and
spending into line.

00:51:50.430 --> 00:51:55.210
And I certainly would make every effort I
could to live within the revenues that the

00:51:55.210 --> 00:51:57.530
people would make available.
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: Yes, sir.

00:51:57.530 --> 00:52:02.630
&gt;&gt;&gt; So as a follow-up to that, on the spending
side, you may have seen this recent article

00:52:02.630 --> 00:52:08.440
by Joel Kotkin in which he pointed out that
Texas, a similar state to us in size and demography,

00:52:08.440 --> 00:52:15.250
spends far, far less, state government spends
far, far less, and yet their outcomes in terms

00:52:15.250 --> 00:52:19.710
of the core functions of state government
 -- roads, schools, and so forth -- are not

00:52:19.710 --> 00:52:24.520
appreciably worse in quality than ours.
What, if anything, do you think we can learn

00:52:24.520 --> 00:52:30.050
from the experiences of other states about
how to get better value for the money that

00:52:30.050 --> 00:52:35.131
the state government spends?
&gt;&gt;Hon. Jerry Brown: Well, I -- one example

00:52:35.131 --> 00:52:41.250
of that would be in the Texas state prisons.
The cost per inmate for medical care is about

00:52:41.250 --> 00:52:45.570
$3700.
And in California, it's about $14,000.

00:52:45.570 --> 00:52:48.960
So I actually called the people in Texas,
say, "How do you do that?"

00:52:48.960 --> 00:52:53.930
And they've come out here and have been meeting
with both the university, because they have

00:52:53.930 --> 00:53:00.650
a medical capability, and the Department of
Corrections, to examine, are there much cheaper

00:53:00.650 --> 00:53:03.620
ways of doing it?
Now, there are some explanations for that.

00:53:03.620 --> 00:53:11.500
We have a very liberal ninth circuit court.
And they're hearing literally thousands of

00:53:11.500 --> 00:53:17.090
lawsuits against the state of California on
Medi-Cal, but also on just sticking with the

00:53:17.090 --> 00:53:21.570
one example, the prison system.
And the state has been forced to spend billions

00:53:21.570 --> 00:53:26.920
of dollars in response to all this litigation.
And as attorney general, I am engaged on the

00:53:26.920 --> 00:53:32.040
other side in fighting it.
That's why I have a very clear understanding

00:53:32.040 --> 00:53:37.820
of the excesses that have been brought about.
And I think we've got to deal with it in court.

00:53:37.820 --> 00:53:41.120
We have to deal with it in the legislature.
We've got to deal with it through management.

00:53:41.120 --> 00:53:45.300
And I think the prison system is one.
I think you can look all across government.

00:53:45.300 --> 00:53:48.690
If you see other ways we can do it more efficiently,
yes, we can.

00:53:48.690 --> 00:53:51.430
Do we have different kinds of politics and
pressures?

00:53:51.430 --> 00:53:55.360
We do.
And you get certain benefits and you have

00:53:55.360 --> 00:53:57.562
certain costs when you're in the state of
California.

00:53:57.562 --> 00:54:00.360
And you have to manage them.
We're not Texas.

00:54:00.360 --> 00:54:03.480
We're California.
But that doesn't mean to say we can't get

00:54:03.480 --> 00:54:08.280
a lot more efficient and a lot more creative
and generate a lot more wealth.

00:54:08.280 --> 00:54:13.160
That's what we have to do.
At the end of the day, remember, we had a

00:54:13.160 --> 00:54:18.380
gross state product of 1.7 trillion.
There's a lot of wealth creation.

00:54:18.380 --> 00:54:26.120
I think the key task here is, how do we encourage
the continuous growth in that wealth creation

00:54:26.120 --> 00:54:30.880
effort by the people of the state, and where
we can learn something from Texas or New York

00:54:30.880 --> 00:54:35.760
or Vermont, let's learn it.
But even after we learn things, putting it

00:54:35.760 --> 00:54:40.550
through the process, lots of resistance, lots
of resistance.

00:54:40.550 --> 00:54:43.580
But that's no reason why we shouldn't try.
And we can do a lot better.

00:54:43.580 --> 00:54:46.690
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: Thank you.
And you'll have the honor of the last question.

00:54:46.690 --> 00:54:52.060
&gt;&gt;&gt; Thanks again for joining us.
The technology available to you during your

00:54:52.060 --> 00:54:54.810
previous gubernatorial campaign was clearly
different.

00:54:54.810 --> 00:55:00.480
How do you plan to engage voters using the
Internet in your current campaign?

00:55:00.480 --> 00:55:05.140
&gt;&gt;Hon. Jerry Brown: Well, we certainly have
a lot going on in social media.

00:55:05.140 --> 00:55:10.810
We can -- you can go to the domain Jerrybrown.org
and get involved.

00:55:10.810 --> 00:55:14.570
We have Facebook.
We're looking -- I am seeing, when we look

00:55:14.570 --> 00:55:21.970
at a campaign that will spend between 100
and $200 million, we're not going to be able

00:55:21.970 --> 00:55:25.950
to equal that sum.
So we are looking to the Internet, we're looking

00:55:25.950 --> 00:55:34.420
to grass roots, we're looking to people from
different communities, self-organizing in

00:55:34.420 --> 00:55:39.450
ways that will join the debate, join the discussion,
join our campaign.

00:55:39.450 --> 00:55:46.650
And so we're going to take advantage of every
tool that is available through the Internet

00:55:46.650 --> 00:55:52.000
and other technologies so that we can be competitive.
And it will take time to ramp this up.

00:55:52.000 --> 00:55:58.250
But we are -- definitely feel that is going
to be a key element in engaging people and

00:55:58.250 --> 00:56:03.970
getting information to the voters so that
by the time they go in in November, they will

00:56:03.970 --> 00:56:09.730
be able to decide which candidate do I most
identify with, who do I think will fight for

00:56:09.730 --> 00:56:12.710
me.
And, definitely, some of the tools you develop

00:56:12.710 --> 00:56:15.960
here at Google are something we're looking
at.

00:56:15.960 --> 00:56:23.140
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: Well, governor, your service
to California has been a part of I think all

00:56:23.140 --> 00:56:26.510
of our lives for many, many years.
You've dedicated your whole public -- literally,

00:56:26.510 --> 00:56:32.230
your whole adult life to public service and
to trying to make the world a better place.

00:56:32.230 --> 00:56:42.194
I think all of us have seen your sensibility
and your approach, and I think all of us wish

00:56:42.194 --> 00:56:43.850
you very good luck in this upcoming election.
Thank you very much for coming to Google.

00:56:43.850 --> 00:56:44.390
&gt;&gt;Hon. Jerry Brown: Thank you.
