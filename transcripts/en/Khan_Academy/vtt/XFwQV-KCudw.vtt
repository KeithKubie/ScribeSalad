00:00:00.196 --> 00:00:02.018
- [Voiceover] So I have a
rational expression here

00:00:02.018 --> 00:00:05.282
and my goal is to simplify
it, but while I simplify it,

00:00:05.282 --> 00:00:07.657
I wanna make the simplified expression

00:00:07.657 --> 00:00:09.406
be algebraically equivalent.

00:00:09.406 --> 00:00:10.778
So, if there are certain x values

00:00:10.778 --> 00:00:12.570
that would make this thing undefined,

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:14.982
that I have to restrict
my simplified expression

00:00:14.982 --> 00:00:16.223
by those x values.

00:00:16.223 --> 00:00:18.438
So, you could pause this
video and take a go at it

00:00:18.438 --> 00:00:20.604
and then we'll do it together.

00:00:20.604 --> 00:00:22.486
All right. So let's just think real quick.

00:00:22.486 --> 00:00:26.363
What x values would make
this expression undefined?

00:00:26.363 --> 00:00:28.298
Well, it's undefined if
we try to divide by zero.

00:00:28.298 --> 00:00:30.830
So if x is zero, 14 times zero is zero,

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:32.198
it's going to be undefined.

00:00:32.198 --> 00:00:36.087
And so, we could say this is,

00:00:36.087 --> 00:00:38.798
we could say x does not,
cannot be equal to zero.

00:00:38.798 --> 00:00:41.821
For any other x, we can
evaluate this expression.

00:00:41.821 --> 00:00:43.753
Now let's actually try to simplify it.

00:00:43.753 --> 00:00:45.805
So, when you look at the
numerator and the denominator,

00:00:45.805 --> 00:00:49.125
every term we see is divisible by x

00:00:49.125 --> 00:00:51.725
and every term is divisible by seven.

00:00:51.725 --> 00:00:54.517
So it looks like we can factor
seven x out of the numerator

00:00:54.517 --> 00:00:56.749
and seven x out of the denominator.

00:00:56.749 --> 00:00:58.639
So the numerator, we can rewrite

00:00:58.639 --> 00:01:03.009
as seven x times,

00:01:03.009 --> 00:01:04.931
we factor seven x out of 14 x squared,

00:01:04.931 --> 00:01:07.203
we're gonna be left with two x

00:01:07.203 --> 00:01:09.015
and then you factor
seven x out of seven x,

00:01:09.015 --> 00:01:11.237
you're gonna be left with a one.

00:01:11.237 --> 00:01:12.105
And one way to think about it

00:01:12.105 --> 00:01:15.061
is we did the distributive
property in reverse,

00:01:15.061 --> 00:01:15.872
if we were to do it again,

00:01:15.872 --> 00:01:18.545
seven x times two x is 14 x squared,

00:01:18.545 --> 00:01:22.148
seven x times one is seven x.

00:01:22.148 --> 00:01:24.141
All right. And now let's factor seven x

00:01:24.141 --> 00:01:26.182
out of the denominator.

00:01:26.182 --> 00:01:28.644
So, 14 x could be rewritten

00:01:28.644 --> 00:01:32.344
as seven x times two,

00:01:32.344 --> 00:01:34.055
times two,

00:01:34.055 --> 00:01:36.834
and remember, I wanna keep
this algebraically equivalent,

00:01:36.834 --> 00:01:38.410
so I wanna keep the constraint

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:41.902
that x cannot be equal to zero.

00:01:41.902 --> 00:01:43.741
And so we divide the numerator

00:01:43.741 --> 00:01:46.599
and the denominator by seven x
or one way to think about it,

00:01:46.599 --> 00:01:49.310
you can divide seven x by
seven x and just get one

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:51.378
and we are left with

00:01:51.378 --> 00:01:55.328
two x plus one over two.

00:01:55.328 --> 00:01:57.063
Now this was the original expression,

00:01:57.063 --> 00:01:58.961
x could take on any value,

00:01:58.961 --> 00:02:01.921
but if we want it to be
algebraically equivalent

00:02:01.921 --> 00:02:03.776
to our original expression,

00:02:03.776 --> 00:02:06.146
it has to have the same constraints on.

00:02:06.146 --> 00:02:08.495
So we're going to have to say x,

00:02:08.495 --> 00:02:10.497
x does not equal zero,

00:02:10.497 --> 00:02:13.392
and it's a very subtle but
really important thing.

00:02:13.392 --> 00:02:15.345
For example, if you defined a function

00:02:15.345 --> 00:02:16.810
by this right over here,

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:19.753
the domain of the function
could not include zero.

00:02:19.753 --> 00:02:23.154
And so, if you simplified how you defined

00:02:23.154 --> 00:02:24.445
that function to this,

00:02:24.445 --> 00:02:26.297
if you want that function to be the same,

00:02:26.297 --> 00:02:27.969
it needs to have the same domain.

00:02:27.969 --> 00:02:30.231
It has to be defined for the same inputs.

00:02:30.231 --> 00:02:31.352
And so that's why we're putting

00:02:31.352 --> 00:02:34.544
the exact same constraints
for them to be equivalent.

00:02:34.544 --> 00:02:36.806
If you got rid of this constraint,

00:02:36.806 --> 00:02:38.978
these two would be equivalent everywhere

00:02:38.978 --> 00:02:40.749
except for x equal zero.

00:02:40.749 --> 00:02:42.591
This one would have been
defined for x equal zero,

00:02:42.591 --> 00:02:43.802
this one would not have,

00:02:43.802 --> 00:02:46.194
and so they wouldn't have
been algebraically equivalent.

00:02:46.194 --> 00:02:48.576
This makes them algebraically equivalent.

00:02:48.576 --> 00:02:50.754
And of course you can write
this in different ways.

00:02:50.754 --> 00:02:53.756
You can divide each of these
terms by two, if you like.

00:02:53.756 --> 00:02:56.868
So you could divide two x by two and get x

00:02:56.868 --> 00:03:00.590
and then divide one by two and get 1/2.

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:02.521
Once again, we would wanna keep

00:03:02.521 --> 00:03:06.292
the x cannot be equal to zero.

00:03:06.292 --> 00:03:08.783
Let's do another one of these.

00:03:08.783 --> 00:03:10.335
So it's a slightly hairier expression,

00:03:10.335 --> 00:03:11.216
but let's do the same drill.

00:03:11.216 --> 00:03:12.617
See if we could simplify it.

00:03:12.617 --> 00:03:16.059
But as we simplify it, we
really wanna be conscientious

00:03:16.059 --> 00:03:19.020
of restricting the Zs here

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:22.622
so that we get an algebraically
equivalent expression.

00:03:22.622 --> 00:03:24.784
So, let's think about
where this is undefined.

00:03:24.784 --> 00:03:26.076
We can think about where it's undefined

00:03:26.076 --> 00:03:29.708
by factoring the denominator here.

00:03:29.708 --> 00:03:31.009
Actually, let me just...

00:03:31.009 --> 00:03:33.581
So, this is going to be equal to,

00:03:33.581 --> 00:03:35.102
actually, let me just...

00:03:35.102 --> 00:03:37.184
Let me just do the first
step where I could say,

00:03:37.184 --> 00:03:38.345
"Well, what's a common factor

00:03:38.345 --> 00:03:40.274
"in the numerator and the denominator?"

00:03:40.274 --> 00:03:43.176
Every term here is divided by z squared

00:03:43.176 --> 00:03:45.812
and every term is also divided by 17,

00:03:45.812 --> 00:03:49.395
so it looks like 17 z
squared can be factored out.

00:03:49.395 --> 00:03:53.199
So, 17 z squared can be
factored out of the numerator

00:03:53.199 --> 00:03:55.824
and then we would be left with,

00:03:55.824 --> 00:03:59.295
we factor out of 17 z squared
out of 17 z to the third

00:03:59.295 --> 00:04:01.607
and we're gonna be left with just a z.

00:04:01.607 --> 00:04:04.274
17 z squared, you factor
17 z squared out of that

00:04:04.274 --> 00:04:06.569
and you're gonna be left with just a one.

00:04:06.569 --> 00:04:09.773
And once again, you can
distribute the 17 z squared,

00:04:09.773 --> 00:04:12.495
multiply it times z, you
get 17 z to the third.

00:04:12.495 --> 00:04:16.309
17 z squared times one is 17 z squared.

00:04:16.309 --> 00:04:19.626
All right. All of that
is going to be over,

00:04:19.626 --> 00:04:21.288
we wanna factor out of 17 z squared

00:04:21.288 --> 00:04:23.186
out of the denominator,

00:04:23.186 --> 00:04:27.096
17 z squared times,

00:04:27.096 --> 00:04:31.520
and so 34 z to the third
divided by 17 z squared,

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:34.570
34 divided by 17 is two,

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:38.570
and z to the third
divided by z squared is z

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:43.570
and then we have minus
51 divided 17 is three

00:04:43.622 --> 00:04:47.053
and z squared divided by
z squared is just one.

00:04:47.053 --> 00:04:50.116
So we'll just leave it like that.

00:04:50.116 --> 00:04:52.058
And so over here, it
becomes a little bit clear

00:04:52.058 --> 00:04:53.930
of, well one, how we're gonna simplify it.

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:57.163
We're just gonna divided 17
z squared by 17 z squared,

00:04:57.163 --> 00:04:59.799
but let's be careful to
restrict the domain here.

00:04:59.799 --> 00:05:02.055
So, we can tell if z is equal to zero,

00:05:02.055 --> 00:05:05.571
then this, 17 z squared
is gonna be equal to zero

00:05:05.571 --> 00:05:06.953
and we make the denominator equal to zero

00:05:06.953 --> 00:05:08.795
and we could see that even looking here.

00:05:08.795 --> 00:05:12.055
So we could say z cannot be equal to zero.

00:05:12.055 --> 00:05:14.636
Now what else? Z cannot be equal to

00:05:14.636 --> 00:05:17.790
whatever makes this two z
minus three equals zero.

00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:18.761
So let's think about what makes

00:05:18.761 --> 00:05:21.354
two z minus three equal to zero.

00:05:21.354 --> 00:05:24.657
Two z minus three is equal to zero.

00:05:24.657 --> 00:05:26.686
You can add three to both sides

00:05:26.686 --> 00:05:29.982
and you would get two z is equal to three.

00:05:29.982 --> 00:05:32.065
Divide both sides by two

00:05:32.065 --> 00:05:35.344
and you would get z is equal to 3/2.

00:05:35.344 --> 00:05:37.925
So z cannot be equal to zero

00:05:37.925 --> 00:05:42.197
and z cannot be equal to 3/2.

00:05:42.197 --> 00:05:44.393
So that's how we're gonna
restrict our domain.

00:05:44.393 --> 00:05:47.013
But now let's simplify.

00:05:47.013 --> 00:05:51.054
So, if we simplify it,
these two cancel out

00:05:51.054 --> 00:05:52.986
and we are going to be left with,

00:05:52.986 --> 00:05:56.122
we're gonna be left with z plus one

00:05:56.122 --> 00:05:59.138
over two z minus three

00:05:59.138 --> 00:06:00.700
and we wanna keep that constraint.

00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:05.077
z cannot be equal to zero.

00:06:05.077 --> 00:06:07.173
And actually, this second
constraint is redundant

00:06:07.173 --> 00:06:09.095
because we still have the
two z minus three here.

00:06:09.095 --> 00:06:10.877
If someone were to just
look at this expression,

00:06:10.877 --> 00:06:13.506
like, well, the denominator
can't be equal to zero

00:06:13.506 --> 00:06:16.215
and so, z cannot be equal to 3/2.

00:06:16.215 --> 00:06:18.314
So this is still, if we
just left it the way it is,

00:06:18.314 --> 00:06:19.936
we don't even have to rewrite this,

00:06:19.936 --> 00:06:22.352
that would be redundant since
looking at this expression

00:06:22.352 --> 00:06:26.349
is clearly not defined for z equals 3/2.

00:06:26.349 --> 00:06:28.121
So, there you go.

00:06:28.121 --> 00:06:29.155
And so I'm gonna ask you

00:06:29.155 --> 00:06:32.258
for what values does this
expression not defined,

00:06:32.258 --> 00:06:34.010
well then you would also include that.

00:06:34.010 --> 00:06:35.031
Actually, let me just write it.

00:06:35.031 --> 00:06:37.033
It doesn't hurt to be redundant.

00:06:37.033 --> 00:06:40.578
z does not equal 3/2.

00:06:40.578 --> 00:06:42.986
But this constraint right
here is really important

00:06:42.986 --> 00:06:44.844
because it's not obvious by
looking at this expression.

00:06:44.844 --> 00:06:46.483
This expression by itself

00:06:46.483 --> 00:06:48.718
would be defined for z equals zero,

00:06:48.718 --> 00:06:50.820
but if we want it to be
algebraically equivalent

00:06:50.820 --> 00:06:52.011
to this one and that one,

00:06:52.011 --> 00:06:54.618
it has to be constrained

00:06:54.618 --> 00:06:57.544
in the same way.
