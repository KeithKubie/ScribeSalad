00:00:00.656 --> 00:00:02.219
- [Instructor] What we're
going to do in this video

00:00:02.219 --> 00:00:06.011
is think about the rise of
empires and make the comparison

00:00:06.011 --> 00:00:10.232
with four very early empires
that we have studied,

00:00:10.232 --> 00:00:14.399
Achaemenid Persia, the Maurya
Empire in India, Han China,

00:00:17.125 --> 00:00:19.486
and the Roman Empire.

00:00:19.486 --> 00:00:22.647
So let's just start with
a general framework.

00:00:22.647 --> 00:00:26.230
So the first question
is what is an empire?

00:00:27.389 --> 00:00:30.145
A broad definition of an
empire is when one group

00:00:30.145 --> 00:00:33.895
has control over a fairly
diverse population.

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:37.380
One group has control over another group

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:40.032
that might have different
linguistic practices,

00:00:40.032 --> 00:00:44.136
different culture, that's when
it is considered an empire.

00:00:44.136 --> 00:00:45.249
Well what's the general framework

00:00:45.249 --> 00:00:48.014
for how empires tend to form?

00:00:48.014 --> 00:00:50.490
Well let's say that I
am a ruler and I control

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:54.991
this territory right over
here and either through

00:00:54.991 --> 00:00:59.158
my charisma, my military tactics,
maybe I have a new weapon,

00:01:01.047 --> 00:01:04.106
some political intrigue,
some weak neighbors,

00:01:04.106 --> 00:01:07.666
I'm able to conquer some more
territory right over here.

00:01:07.666 --> 00:01:09.056
What does that do for me?

00:01:09.056 --> 00:01:12.056
As I expand, this gives me more land

00:01:14.782 --> 00:01:17.928
and more people to rule over

00:01:17.928 --> 00:01:22.095
and I can tax that land and
people to have more wealth

00:01:24.585 --> 00:01:28.472
and larger armies and so these two things

00:01:28.472 --> 00:01:31.935
are pretty good ingredients
to be able to take on

00:01:31.935 --> 00:01:36.102
even more of my neighbors
and expand even further.

00:01:37.699 --> 00:01:39.537
And so you might say well,
why doesn't that process

00:01:39.537 --> 00:01:42.454
just keep on going on indefinitely?

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:47.056
Well it does go pretty far,
you see these various empires

00:01:47.056 --> 00:01:50.500
are quite large especially when
you consider the technology

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:53.757
of the time, the communications
ability of the time

00:01:53.757 --> 00:01:57.146
but at some point, you
might have weak leadership,

00:01:57.146 --> 00:01:59.859
you might have trouble
controlling these large

00:01:59.859 --> 00:02:02.447
and spread out empires especially
if you can't communicate,

00:02:02.447 --> 00:02:04.424
if you can't get good information.

00:02:04.424 --> 00:02:05.710
But now let's dive a little bit deeper

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:09.210
into the four empires we just referred to.

00:02:10.381 --> 00:02:14.126
So let's start Achaemenid
Persia, founded in 550 BCE

00:02:14.126 --> 00:02:16.228
by Cyrus the Great.

00:02:16.228 --> 00:02:19.238
This is so far in the past
that most of our accounts

00:02:19.238 --> 00:02:22.081
of how Cyrus comes to
power come from the Greeks

00:02:22.081 --> 00:02:24.529
who were not friends with the Persians,

00:02:24.529 --> 00:02:27.725
they were famous rivals,
but one thing comes clear

00:02:27.725 --> 00:02:30.264
in the narrative, which
is that Cyrus the Great

00:02:30.264 --> 00:02:33.918
was considered a very
strong and effective leader

00:02:33.918 --> 00:02:36.278
so I'll definitely put leadership there.

00:02:36.278 --> 00:02:39.017
He starts off as a relatively minor king

00:02:39.017 --> 00:02:42.564
subject to you could say
the emperor of Medes,

00:02:42.564 --> 00:02:46.065
who is his grandfather, and
he's able to overthrow him

00:02:46.065 --> 00:02:48.696
but because of his military leadership,

00:02:48.696 --> 00:02:51.400
his ability to bring people into the fold,

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:53.978
he was known as being
tolerant of the people

00:02:53.978 --> 00:02:57.220
he would rule over, that
that all helped him control

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:59.706
and expand a large empire.

00:02:59.706 --> 00:03:02.741
So I would say leadership is
definitely first for Cyrus

00:03:02.741 --> 00:03:06.749
the Great and then I would say
culture would be part of it.

00:03:06.749 --> 00:03:08.948
Now let's think about Maurya, India.

00:03:08.948 --> 00:03:12.543
Maurya, India was founded
by Chandragupta Maurya

00:03:12.543 --> 00:03:15.257
and here once again,
I would say leadership

00:03:15.257 --> 00:03:19.560
was a major factor, he was
aided by his political advisor

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:22.350
Chanakya who is famous in Indian history

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:24.945
for his strategic thinking.

00:03:24.945 --> 00:03:27.898
Chandragupta Maurya, legend
has it, met Alexander the Great

00:03:27.898 --> 00:03:30.622
when he came into the
Indus but once Alexander

00:03:30.622 --> 00:03:33.580
the Great left, there was a power vacuum.

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:36.600
You could say that that
power vacuum helped

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:39.110
the Maurya Empire be founded.

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:41.236
It's similar to the notion
of having weaker neighbors

00:03:41.236 --> 00:03:44.216
once Alexander the Great left.

00:03:44.216 --> 00:03:47.497
And so Han China, Han
China is interesting.

00:03:47.497 --> 00:03:51.397
The first emperors of Han
China aren't the ones to first

00:03:51.397 --> 00:03:55.430
unify China, that happens
under the Qin Dynasty,

00:03:55.430 --> 00:04:00.047
Q-I-N, Qin Dynasty that
preceded the Han Dynasty

00:04:00.047 --> 00:04:03.560
and they were able to do
that by being very strong,

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:07.580
very authoritarian, very
centralized but once the Qin

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:11.915
emperor dies, it leaves
a clear power vacuum

00:04:11.915 --> 00:04:13.774
and then you have a succession battle

00:04:13.774 --> 00:04:16.721
but eventually the Han Dynasty is formed.

00:04:16.721 --> 00:04:19.632
One of the ways that the Han
Dynasty is able to keep power

00:04:19.632 --> 00:04:23.624
despite not being as
authoritarian as the Qin

00:04:23.624 --> 00:04:27.254
is that they revitalized
Confucianism and used

00:04:27.254 --> 00:04:30.313
that ideology and used that culture

00:04:30.313 --> 00:04:34.486
in order to more unify the Chinese people.

00:04:34.486 --> 00:04:37.745
The Roman empire we study in some detail.

00:04:37.745 --> 00:04:39.482
It's hard to pin a date on exactly

00:04:39.482 --> 00:04:41.237
when it becomes an empire.

00:04:41.237 --> 00:04:44.050
On this timeline, this
first period right over here

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:47.144
is when we have the Roman
kingdom, then you have the Roman

00:04:47.144 --> 00:04:50.669
Republic, and then you
have the Roman Empire.

00:04:50.669 --> 00:04:53.983
And so you could debate when
it actually becomes an empire,

00:04:53.983 --> 00:04:57.514
even when it was an early
kingdom, it was conquering

00:04:57.514 --> 00:05:01.011
neighboring people on
the Italian peninsula

00:05:01.011 --> 00:05:04.249
and at that time period, it
might have felt like an empire

00:05:04.249 --> 00:05:06.433
because those people
might have felt different.

00:05:06.433 --> 00:05:10.005
As time passed and they
were under a unified state,

00:05:10.005 --> 00:05:13.206
under a unified kingdom, they
probably felt more similar

00:05:13.206 --> 00:05:15.740
but then when they conquered
even more territory,

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:18.794
that might have felt more
and more like an empire.

00:05:18.794 --> 00:05:20.960
But what is clear is even as we get

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:24.632
into the late republic
period, it was an empire.

00:05:24.632 --> 00:05:28.234
Julius Caesar famously
conquered Gaul, these Germanic

00:05:28.234 --> 00:05:31.872
peoples, before coming back
and essentially taking control

00:05:31.872 --> 00:05:34.407
to be succeeded by the
first official Roman Empire

00:05:34.407 --> 00:05:38.516
after a long and bloody
civil war, Augustus Caesar.

00:05:38.516 --> 00:05:41.665
These other three empires
happened relatively quickly,

00:05:41.665 --> 00:05:45.510
we're talking within a
period of less than 50 years

00:05:45.510 --> 00:05:49.069
while the Roman Empire took
hundreds of years to form.

00:05:49.069 --> 00:05:53.933
And so it's hard to ascribe
the empire to any one leader.

00:05:53.933 --> 00:05:58.125
You could say that there
was a culture of expansion,

00:05:58.125 --> 00:05:59.887
one could make the argument
that they were more

00:05:59.887 --> 00:06:03.003
technologically sophisticated
than some of their neighbors,

00:06:03.003 --> 00:06:05.988
especially when it came to military might

00:06:05.988 --> 00:06:10.021
and as it expanded, it definitely
was able to take advantage

00:06:10.021 --> 00:06:14.726
of weak neighbors so now
let's just take a step back.

00:06:14.726 --> 00:06:18.403
What we've done in this exercise
is a rough approximation

00:06:18.403 --> 00:06:20.150
of the various dimensions that might

00:06:20.150 --> 00:06:22.706
lead to an empire rising.

00:06:22.706 --> 00:06:25.490
It's by no means comprehensive
and I suggest for you

00:06:25.490 --> 00:06:28.533
to think about what dimensions
would you add to this?

00:06:28.533 --> 00:06:30.652
Maybe you could add a political dimension

00:06:30.652 --> 00:06:32.348
or maybe that's captured by leadership.

00:06:32.348 --> 00:06:34.424
Maybe you would add an economic dimension,

00:06:34.424 --> 00:06:36.482
how much wealth a nation has.

00:06:36.482 --> 00:06:39.082
And as we go forward in history,
we're gonna see different

00:06:39.082 --> 00:06:41.455
weights on these different dimensions

00:06:41.455 --> 00:06:44.604
for how important they
are for empire formation.

00:06:44.604 --> 00:06:47.834
Especially as we get closer
and closer to modern times,

00:06:47.834 --> 00:06:50.854
technology increases as a factor

00:06:50.854 --> 00:06:53.295
in terms of creating an empire.

00:06:53.295 --> 00:06:56.319
Ideology plays a
significant role in empires

00:06:56.319 --> 00:06:59.718
based on religion but we
also have empires based on

00:06:59.718 --> 00:07:04.344
economic ideology,
communism versus capitalism.

00:07:04.344 --> 00:07:06.758
And on political ideology.

00:07:06.758 --> 00:07:10.281
And does an empire have
to be strict control?

00:07:10.281 --> 00:07:11.855
Can you have a cultural empire

00:07:11.855 --> 00:07:16.754
without necessarily having
direct control over people?

00:07:16.754 --> 00:07:18.914
So I will leave you with these questions,

00:07:18.914 --> 00:07:20.474
they're fascinating
questions to think about

00:07:20.474 --> 00:07:22.930
within the context of these empires

00:07:22.930 --> 00:07:26.005
but also as we study all of world history.
