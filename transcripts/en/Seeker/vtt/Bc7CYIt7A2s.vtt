00:00:00.149 --> 00:00:02.730
Like it or not, political season is upon us.

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:06.730
This is going to be the most expensive political
season in the history of ever -- so you KNOW

00:00:06.730 --> 00:00:10.749
strategists on every side are going to try
and gain the upper hand...

00:00:10.749 --> 00:00:19.380
But how?

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:23.029
If you’re staying on top of how the 2016
presidential election is shaping up, you will

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:27.820
likely hear from political strategists talking
about the best way for a candidate to win.

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:31.839
A lot of times they’ll throw around the
term “game theory” and how it’s the

00:00:31.839 --> 00:00:32.839
key to success.

00:00:32.839 --> 00:00:35.160
WHAT IS IT
Game theory is a way to look at all the possible

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:39.940
outcomes of a rule-based interaction, whether
that's a game of Monopoly or political battle,,and

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:42.670
then pick the ones that are the most advantageous.

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:46.670
When I was researching this principle, my
first thought was the logic of a chess match.

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:50.390
Knowing the rules, a good player can determine
the moves their opponent will make and then

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:52.490
make decisions on what to do.

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:55.560
Game theory does the same, but with the rules
of human interaction.

00:00:55.560 --> 00:01:00.950
It started as a mathematical theory for economics
-- invented by John Nash of A Beautiful Mind

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:03.080
fame, and John Von Neumann.

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:06.750
But nearly every human interaction you have
can be described by game theory.

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:07.750
Every.

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:08.750
Thing.

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:11.340
If you're eyeballing the last slice of pizza,
you're doing game theory to figure out if

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:12.340
you should take it.

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:16.370
If you are talking to a business partner about
salary, you're using game theory.

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:19.380
If you're asking someone on a date: game theory!!

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:20.380
It's everywhere!

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:24.880
You can distill it into one simple idea: what's
the best way to get the ideal payoff with

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:25.880
minimal risk.

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:29.700
The most famous example used for game theory
is "the prisoner's dilemma."

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:34.050
Two prisoners are being interrogated in separate
rooms, and their fates are intertwined.

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:35.050
Sound familiar?

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:37.071
It's used in movies and tv all the time.

00:01:37.071 --> 00:01:40.190
The prisoners have the option to be silent
or snitch on their fellow prisoner.

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:44.710
It helps to create a matrix like thisand fill
it in as we go.

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:48.710
If one snitches and the other is silent -- the
snitch goes free; but if they're both silent

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:52.350
(or both snitch), they'll see varying levels
of reduced punishments.

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:54.950
Put another way, think of the Cold War.

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:58.190
The US and Russia had two choices, arm or
disarm.

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:03.400
Logically, they'd want to disarm, save money
and have no war, but because that's mathematically

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:08.920
unlikely, the rational choice was to arm,
because they will either maintain superiority

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:13.609
(because the other disarms), or equality (because
they both arm)!

00:02:13.609 --> 00:02:16.359
THE TRICKY PART FOR CANDIDATES
Game theory attempts to explain why rational

00:02:16.359 --> 00:02:20.650
people, organizations, businesses or governments
may not cooperate, even though it may be in

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:22.269
their mutual best interest.

00:02:22.269 --> 00:02:26.480
When it comes to running for president, the
rules and players are there, but how each

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:30.239
candidate chooses where to campaign can come
down to game theory.

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:34.939
For a practical example, let’s use the candidates
from U.S. presidential election in 2004.

00:02:34.939 --> 00:02:39.749
In an article for Slate, University of Wisconsin
math professor Jordan Ellenberg did some math

00:02:39.749 --> 00:02:44.290
for us, thank goodness: So let’s say George
Bush and John Kerry have only one more day

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:48.580
to make a stop… and Florida and Ohio are
key swing states…

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:52.469
The Bush campaign can use Game theory to figure
out which state to visit.

00:02:52.469 --> 00:02:57.819
If Bush has a 70 percent chance of winning
Florida and only 30% chance in Ohio, where

00:02:57.819 --> 00:02:59.079
should he go?

00:02:59.079 --> 00:03:01.840
By visiting a state he'll get a 10% bump.

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:06.159
Our gut tells us, he should go to Ohio so
he can boost his numbers there, but is that

00:03:06.159 --> 00:03:08.219
right?

00:03:08.219 --> 00:03:10.129
Game theory has the answer.

00:03:10.129 --> 00:03:15.230
If both Bush and Kerry go the same state,
Bush has a 21% chance of winning the overall

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:16.230
election.

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:21.930
If Bush visits Florida and Kerry Ohio, he
drops to a 16% chance of winning, but if Bush

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:25.919
goes to Ohio and Kerry goes to Florida, then
his chances of winning jump to 24%.

00:03:25.919 --> 00:03:32.129
So, his "dominant strategy" is to go to Ohio
and ignore Kerry, because he'll either get

00:03:32.129 --> 00:03:34.340
a 24 or 21 percent chance of winning.

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:38.870
Laying out the strategy for both players,
is called the "Nash Equilibrium."

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:42.930
Which says both would be satisfied with their
current strategy even knowing in advance their

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:44.209
opponents strategy.

00:03:44.209 --> 00:03:47.169
This helps because candidates don't always
know what the other is going to do, and the

00:03:47.169 --> 00:03:49.749
rules of the game are rarely so straightforward.

00:03:49.749 --> 00:03:54.019
Now that the 2016 Presidential Election season
has begun, Republican candidates are each

00:03:54.019 --> 00:03:57.569
trying to unseat the other to win the GOP
nomination.

00:03:57.569 --> 00:04:01.269
Game theory doesn't provide solid answers,
but gives rational thought to what can be

00:04:01.269 --> 00:04:03.579
emotional decision-making.

00:04:03.579 --> 00:04:07.510
By guessing all the possible paths of current
frontrunner Donald Trump[7] the other candidates

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:12.989
may have gotten more benefit from letting
Trump come off as a bully, rather than fighting

00:04:12.989 --> 00:04:14.599
him on policy or rhetoric.

00:04:14.599 --> 00:04:18.389
By running game theory each campaign can increase
their chances of coming out on top.

00:04:18.389 --> 00:04:22.240
It might be too early for the candidates to
have all the rules of the 2016 election set

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:27.270
in stone, but like in chess, each candidate
is trying to decide what the other candidates

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:31.970
are doing, and what moves each can make, to
give themselves the greatest advantage.

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:37.080
Obviously, this can get WAY complicated WAY
fast, but it's super interesting.

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:44.539
