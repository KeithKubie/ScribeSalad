00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:04.720
We've already done all the hard work of creating our animation with our

00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:06.100
update function.

00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:10.550
Including things like filtering our data, removing and

00:00:10.550 --> 00:00:14.700
adding any new elements that need to be placed on the page.

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:19.480
As well as dealing with the data binding key function which determined which

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:26.550
elements to add or remove, d3 has great support for built in transitions.

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:30.600
And all you need to do to make the transition smooth is use

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:33.180
d3's special built in functions.

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:36.810
One of which is transition which kicks off a transition.

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:40.260
And the second most used is the duration.

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:45.160
In this case we make our selection, we append anything that needs to

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:50.660
be appended, and then kick off a transition that takes 500 milliseconds.

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:54.010
And what actually changes during the transition?

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:55.990
Well that's what comes after it.

00:00:55.990 --> 00:00:58.990
All of these attributes which move the circles and

00:00:58.990 --> 00:01:03.720
set the radius take 500 milliseconds to complete and

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:08.390
operate on the enter selection and the circles we are appending.

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:13.935
So now when we're adding circles they'll transition more smoothly, but

00:01:13.935 --> 00:01:19.320
also potentially more importantly we want the countries to transition smoothly.

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:22.170
So following the exact same syntax we

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:26.390
place transition with a duration of 500 milliseconds.

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:31.630
Right before we change the fill and the stroke of countries to update and

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:34.930
hide or show based on the year of the world cup.

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:38.100
I would say this is one reason to use D3's built in

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:43.420
style functions to add style to our elements rather than using CSS.

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:48.780
So we can have much more flexibility in how we animate and apply those styles.

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:52.220
As you can see here, the countries transition out and

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:56.390
in much smoother than they did before since we added the transition to

00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:00.550
the styles applied to the countries as well as the circles.

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:01.460
As they come in and

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:05.910
get placed at the respective home countries they belong on top of.

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:09.990
And now that we have finished our map, or at least the animation of it,

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:12.960
we can start to see a little story unfolding.

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:15.170
Can you find a narrative in the graphic we've created?
