Speaker 1:          00:00          Please discuss how discipline in one area doesn't make up for slack in other areas. For example, the fit is guru who has no savings. Mm. Yeah. You know, this is something that we all have to work out, watch out for, is the fact that we, we focus on our strengths. That's what we do. That's what people do. So you get a person that's smart, really intellectual person and they let themselves go physically, right? You know, or you get a person that's a physical stud, but then they're not going to challenge their brain power. Or like the question that was, you know, the example here that was posed, you know, someone that's a fitness guru or a party goofy. I'm throwing that one out there because some people are really good that sure. Or they, you know, they're an entrepreneur, entrepreneur and so they're driving a new Mercedes, but it's at least, and they're behind on payments.

Speaker 1:          01:00          So strategically yet. Yeah, yeah. That, um, so you know, I mean, you take another example is what about the business person that doesn't have time for their family, right. And so that's not good. So I think the focus here is we try and we all have to be, try to be well rounded and not focus so much on one area that you're going to let some ed area go. That's target fixation is what that is, right? Is you walk into a room and you get fixated on one target, one bad guy, you think there's one bad guy. So you focus all your energy and then you're getting flanked. That's target fixation. You can't let that happen. You can't let it happen on the battlefield. You can't let it happen on the life. So look out for that when you do this. Um, and I'll tell you this is actually a reality of the situation.

Speaker 1:          01:49          Um, I try and maintain this balance, but I've been actually working a lot lately and what, and this is a clear indicator to me that I've overbooked myself is last week, um, we had to, we had to skip a day of Jujitsu to record. I mean, we don't do that right? When do we record? We recorded after Jujitsu. But I knew I had so much stuff going on that I said, hey we gotta we gotta record at this time cause I gotta get all this other stuff done because I'm traveling and this and that until we had to skip the huge it's called. So that is a red flag to me that says I need to, I need to tighten up, I need to get my, get my schedule back in check so that I can do the things that I need to do. Of course, what do I say about the situation?

Speaker 1:          02:41          It's fine. You know what? Can't train Jujitsu that day cause I'm trying, I've got some travel coming up. Good. I'm going to heal up my shoulder a little bit more. I'm going to, you know, I'm going to, it's good, it's fine. But it is an indicator of when things start going in the wrong direction. Maybe I'm getting targeted, fixated on, you know, too much work at a certain time, which to me again, I will run this thing in the red as you say. I like, I like running in the red, right. I'm in the red and I got no problem. Like we will go hard and the numbers of hours I've been where I will work, we'll have actually no impact on how much I'm going to tell them to spend with my family and do Jujitsu and all that stuff cause I'll just do it all. But there is a capacity that you reach where you go.

Speaker 1:          03:28          Okay now one of these things that is just started to slide. Now I need to make sure that my levels get re re levels, I guess you might say equalized is what I should have said. Uh, so back to the subject. Don't be a one trick pony. You know, be a jack of all trades and master a few of those traits. And so you can emphasize fitness guru, you can emphasize intellectual power, you can emphasize Jujitsu, but don't put 100% of your effort into one area because eventually it will take you, you won't have anything else. And by the way, if you put all your, you know, if you put all your, all your eggs in the basket of intellectual power, now you're unhealthy. And You die, right. That that doesn't, you know, I don't care how smart you are. You can't do two plus two when you're dead. So don't put all your focus 100% into one area. Don't become unbalanced in your disciplines. Spread it around and hold the line. Yeah man, it's good. Yeah. I guess it kind of feels like, like you can be understood that, um, let's see. I'm real good at, I dunno, fitness

Speaker 2:          04:58          and it's easy to justify your yourself, you know, like your, your, let's say, okay, I'm real good at fitness in the fitness guru and I go around and then I see on and all, I go to the store, go to some party and I see this other guy who's like socially, he's just hundred percent. Everyone likes him. Such a nice, charismatic guy, makes a lot of money in on all this stuff, but he's not in that good a shape or I don't know. You smokes in whatever, you know, it's ease. I think a lot of people,

Speaker 1:          05:26          cool.

Speaker 2:          05:28          It feels like it's easy to justify wolf that gets in bad shape. So who cares? I already didn't want any of that. I wouldn't want all the money, you know, all this stuff. It seems like you

Speaker 1:          05:37          got to justify that and you know if the other guy saying, yeah, you might be in good shape. Guessing what? Yeah. Nice. Toyota Corolla you're driving. He's all negative on it. Yeah. Yeah. So both those guys should, you should, instead of saying, hey, you know what, they should do, walk up and be like, hey man, you know what? I noticed you're pretty successful financially. I like to get in the game with you a little bit and learn from you about that. Any other guys should say to them, well, you know what? It looks like you're in pretty good at fitness levels. I would like to get in the game with that. Let's work together and improve ourselves and go out and kick ass and dominate. Are you in, I'm in, let's do this instead. What does a normal person do? They do exactly what you said.

Speaker 1:          06:20          Justify, criticized, cut people down instead of building them up. Yeah. And once you have to be careful of, if I was to go to you and say, hey, you know echo, I got a lot of money. I can tell you don't have a lot, I'll help you out. That's, that can be offensive to some people. Yeah. Cause you think dude, who you think you are at risk and need your help? I'm going to worry about money. I think I'm worried about money. When I got abs like Yup. So we have to do is instead of, if I came to you and said, echo dude, I want to add is like you got, can you help me get in the game? And then we formed a little relationship and now I say to you, man, so what do you got? What's your, what's your main income stream dude?

Speaker 1:          07:02          You know, what are you doing? And you say, well you know I've got these two clients. If you've got a website, no, not really. Why don't you have a website? Do you got any social media to advertise on it? You know? And we go though that road and we build up. We take care of each other. That's what we want to do as people. Yeah. Kind of like you ever seen the guys who go, they see like a football player or something. It'd be like, Hey, kick his ass though. You know, you know that Kinda guy who can always like some successful person that he, I kick his ass though. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Well I've told the story in four in the seat, in the seal teams, it's a, Eh, no one, no one is good. If a guy, look, we have guys in the seal teams that are literally, you know, world class athletes in whatever world, class triathlete, world class, sailor worldclass, whatever. And so, oh you, oh, you're, you're world class triathlete. Oh yeah. That guy is really good traffic. That's cool. He's a really bad shot. Someone who's going to chime in and cut them down and just the way it goes. Little slack, no slack. Slack.
