00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:05.260
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, D.C.

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:21.280
&gt;&gt; Catherine Rowland: This next
panel is going to be on Fair Use

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:23.870 position:56%
and I think it's going to be a
little abbreviated due to the length

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:27.150
of the earlier panel but
originally it was supposed to be

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:29.640
in the next panel but we realized
it was such a large issue we wanted

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:32.800
to separate it out so I think
it should work fine this way.

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:38.000
So Fair Use is obviously a very
important defense in copyright law

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.080
and we've seen it raised in
a lot of different context

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:44.850 position:56%
with computer software and with this
panel we really want to narrow it

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:48.830
to the attempt to see what
consumer, everyday products

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:50.720
and imbedded software
use but obviously

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:54.150
that is informed by
Fair Use law overall.

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:59.150
So I kind of want to open the
panel with a broad question

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:06.540
about is Fair Use functioning well
in connection with these types

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.690
of products and software?

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:11.150
Does anyone have any views on that?

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:14.450
Okay. Mr. Harbeson.

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:18.350
&gt;&gt; Eric Harbeson: I'm also one
of the non-lawyers on this panel

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:21.700
so someone feel free to
correct me if I'm wrong but it

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:24.160
as I'm understanding
it to the extent

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:34.230
that the licenses are restricting
uses Fair Use isn't relevant

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:40.070
until you clear the contract
violation so for example,

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:46.140
to again take my completely out of
software world example if I wanted

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:53.800
to use Mr. [Inaudible]
recording of his work and the way

00:01:53.800 --> 00:02:00.590
that constitutes a Fair Use
perhaps I would not be subject,

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:04.660
I would not be able to, I would not
have a copyright violation perhaps.

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:09.330
That is my sense is that I wouldn't
perhaps have a copyright violation

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:12.390
but I would still be in
violation of the contract even

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:18.320
if it's a non-infringing use so we
would love for Fair Use to apply.

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:27.390 position:56%
If Fair Use did apply in the context
of and user license agreements

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:30.880
in general I think that that
would be great but I'm not sure

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:35.590
that it even does so please
someone correct me if I'm wrong.

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:36.890
&gt;&gt; Catherine Rowland: Mr. Zuck.

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:40.620
&gt;&gt; Jonathan Zuck: I'll
reiterate that I'm not a lawyer

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:42.940
so I won't be able to correct you

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:47.600
on that although I would
-- that's a weird echo.

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:54.590 position:56%
I think that it generally does apply
in those contexts or that it has

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:59.880
and I guess the interesting
phenomena that I found

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:03.710
as a the photographer and filmmaker
is that Fair Use has come to mean

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:07.080
to the common man you know, I'm
not trying to make money from this

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:11.990 position:56%
and therefore it's Fair Use and so
there is some misconceptions I think

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:17.150
about Fair Use out in the
broader populace for sure

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:21.960
but I think the cases with which
I'm aware of imbedded software

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:25.640
like landmark and things like that
I think that the courts have ruled

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:29.230
in a way that is generally
considered to be the correct way

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:32.270
on this issue even though
those cases were raised

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:36.740
as extreme uses of copyright.

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:43.200 position:56%
It seemed like the specific
exemptions that were laid out in MCA

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:45.880
which is a little bit of
legislative Fair Use I guess

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:48.500
in some respects have
been effective,

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:50.430
so it's certainly my
contention that Fair Use

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:54.910
to the limited degree we have
data at this point about its use

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:58.690
in imbedded devices
has been effective.

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:00.800
&gt;&gt; Catherine Rowland: Mr. Band.

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:03.700
&gt;&gt; Mr. Band: So we'll know
whether Fair Use is effective

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:07.770
in this area more in I
don't know in a few weeks

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:12.620
when the jury reaches its decision
in the Oracle, the Google case

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:15.840
because even though that's
not dealing specifically

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:18.490
with software enabled
products I mean it is.

00:04:18.490 --> 00:04:23.270
I mean it's talking about the
Android and the APIs there

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:27.110
and you know I guess Oracle is
only seeking 8.8 billion dollars

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:34.370
of damages, so hopefully the jury
will reach the right decision

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:37.690
and find that it is a
Fair Use but of course

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:40.950
in my view it shouldn't have
even gotten to the jury.

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:46.040
I mean the District Court
got it right that the issues,

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:50.120
the element was the APIs used
by Google were not protected

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:51.610
by copyright in the first place.

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:58.520 position:56%
You know I think the federal circuit
made a horrible mess and a lot

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:01.090
of what the federal
circuit both of its holding

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:07.130 position:56%
but even worse it's dicta will cause
enormous problems down the road

00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:11.310
for people who want to
make interoperable devices

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:14.960
but basically saying that
interoperability is not,

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:18.080
has nothing to do with
protectability you know,

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:21.930 position:56%
means that you're going to always
be pushed into the Fair Use analysis

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:26.340
if other courts agree
with the federal circuit

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:27.710
which hopefully it won't.

00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:30.980
I think it was a terribly miss,

00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:33.290
we missed a terrible I mean
I'm talking like someone else.

00:05:33.290 --> 00:05:43.610
It's a huge, huge problem caused
by the solicitor general by urging,

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:46.420
by advising the Supreme
Court not to take cert.

00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:48.660
The Supreme Court should
have taken cert in that case

00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:53.740
and it's unfortunate that the
solicitor general basically said

00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:58.090
that the federal circuit
decision was okay and I think

00:05:58.090 --> 00:06:03.380
that hopefully the next time this
comes up the solicitor general is

00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:09.350
in a more forward looking
and makes sure to the extent

00:06:09.350 --> 00:06:11.120
that this does come
up before the court

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:17.360
that the U.S. government
takes the right position.

00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:19.170 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Catherine Rowland: Mr. Bergmayer.

00:06:19.170 --> 00:06:21.740
&gt;&gt; John Bergmayer: Yeah, so you
know take everything I said before

00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:24.370
there's a lot of issues where I
think you shouldn't have to resort

00:06:24.370 --> 00:06:26.940
to Fair Use to adjudicate
certain problems

00:06:26.940 --> 00:06:30.060
so then let's say I lose
those battles legally

00:06:30.060 --> 00:06:31.360
so then what happens?

00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:33.410
So then I would say yes I would
hope that Fair Use is like a sort

00:06:33.410 --> 00:06:36.840
of fallback doctrine can step
in to protect consumer rights

00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:38.690
in certain circumstances.

00:06:38.690 --> 00:06:42.200
That aside, though I
do think that Fair Use

00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:46.810
in software is extremely important
for just a number of respects.

00:06:46.810 --> 00:06:49.650
I'll just name one which
is security research.

00:06:49.650 --> 00:06:54.010
I think part of the imbedded
software debate is the Internet

00:06:54.010 --> 00:06:57.890
of things debate where every
device is attached to the Internet

00:06:57.890 --> 00:06:59.340
and is subject of being hacked.

00:06:59.340 --> 00:07:04.100
I think probably everyone here is
familiar with the baby monitors

00:07:04.100 --> 00:07:07.690
which have been hacked and had
people can remotely watch your baby

00:07:07.690 --> 00:07:09.730
over the Internet because
of devices that ship

00:07:09.730 --> 00:07:12.490
with terrible default
security setting

00:07:12.490 --> 00:07:13.800
where incidentally the sellers

00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:17.830 position:56%
of those devices disclaim
liability via the software licenses.

00:07:17.830 --> 00:07:21.380
There is a door bell incident
where just last week it turns outs

00:07:21.380 --> 00:07:26.610
that a smart door bell system was
accidentally was showing people the

00:07:26.610 --> 00:07:27.910
wrong house.

00:07:27.910 --> 00:07:32.380
That was a server side error but
nevertheless I think in the case

00:07:32.380 --> 00:07:37.150
of software we really do need to
sort of have a robust understanding

00:07:37.150 --> 00:07:39.750
that security researchers

00:07:39.750 --> 00:07:44.200
through whatever copyright doctrine
including Fair Use are entitled

00:07:44.200 --> 00:07:48.870
to inspect software to ensure that
it is not putting people at risk

00:07:48.870 --> 00:07:52.780
and I'll just name another
software related copyright issue

00:07:52.780 --> 00:07:56.060 position:56%
where I think Fair Use has some role
to play which is just the notion

00:07:56.060 --> 00:07:58.720
of as the tools that people use

00:07:58.720 --> 00:08:03.460
for creation become increasingly
sophisticated for example

00:08:03.460 --> 00:08:07.580
with computer animation where
you know you're provided models

00:08:07.580 --> 00:08:11.070
and then people just sort of use
the models as if they are puppets.

00:08:11.070 --> 00:08:13.180
Sometimes this is called machina

00:08:13.180 --> 00:08:16.010
where people are using essentially
video game characters to act

00:08:16.010 --> 00:08:19.540
out plays and then record them.

00:08:19.540 --> 00:08:23.550
You have a very tough
question of who is the author.

00:08:23.550 --> 00:08:26.920
You know I think it's pretty clear
if I write a sonnet on a piece

00:08:26.920 --> 00:08:30.270
of paper the pen and the paper
companies don't have an authorship

00:08:30.270 --> 00:08:33.420
claim in my work but
as software tools

00:08:33.420 --> 00:08:37.780
that people use become increasingly
sophisticated they sometimes claim

00:08:37.780 --> 00:08:41.490
to have an IP interest, an actual
authorship interest in anything

00:08:41.490 --> 00:08:44.470
that you create using
that software tool.

00:08:44.470 --> 00:08:47.460
I think that is a troubling
trend and it's not something

00:08:47.460 --> 00:08:50.550
that I don't think we can resolve
today but I think Fair Use at least

00:08:50.550 --> 00:08:55.820
at the margins will be necessary
to resolve issues like that.

00:08:55.820 --> 00:08:57.130
&gt;&gt; Catherine Rowland: Mr. Bockert.

00:08:57.130 --> 00:08:58.540
&gt;&gt; Shaun J. Bockert: I
think Mr. Bergmayer's,

00:08:58.540 --> 00:09:01.270
I think Mr. Bergmayer's
exactly right in the idea

00:09:01.270 --> 00:09:04.390
that Fair Use is sort of
a defense of last resort

00:09:04.390 --> 00:09:08.230
and you know I'm thinking of
all the times clients call,

00:09:08.230 --> 00:09:10.520
all the time clients call and
they say hey, I want to do this

00:09:10.520 --> 00:09:15.260
and if your explanation to them
is you're not infringing someone's

00:09:15.260 --> 00:09:16.860
copyright because this qualifies

00:09:16.860 --> 00:09:20.170
under Fair Use then they ask the
question you know can we rely

00:09:20.170 --> 00:09:21.470
on that?

00:09:21.470 --> 00:09:25.520
And you know, the answer is
almost always maybe and it's,

00:09:25.520 --> 00:09:29.960
it's going to be an expensive
fight if it comes to it.

00:09:29.960 --> 00:09:33.970
And so I think the idea would
be we could have Fair Use sure

00:09:33.970 --> 00:09:37.460
but I think we need specific
exemptions and clear things

00:09:37.460 --> 00:09:41.550 position:56%
like you know how the First Sale
Doctrine applies in this is context.

00:09:41.550 --> 00:09:44.210
I was talking earlier about the
Doctrine of Repair and the Doctrine

00:09:44.210 --> 00:09:46.310
of Exhaustion in patent
law and things

00:09:46.310 --> 00:09:50.760 position:56%
like that would you know more
clearly show us what is considered a

00:09:50.760 --> 00:09:55.260
non-infringing use of software
in these sorts of products

00:09:55.260 --> 00:09:59.600 position:56%
and then you know on a separate
side I'm always thinking of at least

00:09:59.600 --> 00:10:02.720
in consumer products a
copyright infringement claim

00:10:02.720 --> 00:10:06.750
under 106 is almost always
paired with a claim under 1201

00:10:06.750 --> 00:10:08.460
and I know we're not really
supposed to be talking

00:10:08.460 --> 00:10:10.960
about 1201 very much here
but it's hard to talk

00:10:10.960 --> 00:10:15.220 position:56%
about you know how copyright impacts
software enabled consumer products

00:10:15.220 --> 00:10:20.240 position:56%
without addressing it and you know
I think the Fair Use point is a good

00:10:20.240 --> 00:10:24.240
place to bring it up because Fair
Use you know clearly you know 107

00:10:24.240 --> 00:10:27.360
clearly helps you out under 106

00:10:27.360 --> 00:10:32.880 position:56%
but you know it doesn't clearly
provide a defense under section 1201

00:10:32.880 --> 00:10:36.630
and you know I think that's mostly
because of now the circuit is split

00:10:36.630 --> 00:10:38.770
on whether you need a
nexus to infringement

00:10:38.770 --> 00:10:42.840
on the anti-circumvention claims
and so I think with the lack

00:10:42.840 --> 00:10:45.120
of clarity there we could
probably consider those issues

00:10:45.120 --> 00:10:46.420
in the context of --

00:10:46.420 --> 00:10:49.620
&gt;&gt; Sy Damle: Right but we
do have a 1201 rule making

00:10:49.620 --> 00:10:53.970
where we address you know at some
level we address Fair Use issues.

00:10:53.970 --> 00:10:58.380
We address issues under 117
in the course of getting

00:10:58.380 --> 00:11:00.280
to adopting exemptions
and particularly

00:11:00.280 --> 00:11:04.270
in the auto context
we recently adopted,

00:11:04.270 --> 00:11:08.420
the librarian recently adopted
exemptions allowing vehicle repair,

00:11:08.420 --> 00:11:11.380
so I mean is that a
problem that can be solved

00:11:11.380 --> 00:11:14.710
through the rule making
process, the exemption process?

00:11:14.710 --> 00:11:16.540
&gt;&gt; Shaun J. Bockert: Well I think
those would be separate discussions

00:11:16.540 --> 00:11:19.980
and I think that's why you know
whatever is resolved here is sort

00:11:19.980 --> 00:11:22.650
of dependent on what is resolved
there and I just don't want to --

00:11:22.650 --> 00:11:25.680
I know we're trying to keep the
concepts separate and distinct

00:11:25.680 --> 00:11:28.050
but I think they should
influence each other.

00:11:28.050 --> 00:11:30.650
&gt;&gt; Sy Damle: So but I mean so
to go, to focus on the sort

00:11:30.650 --> 00:11:36.270
of Fair Use point I mean to the
extent that the copyright office

00:11:36.270 --> 00:11:42.180
and the librarian opine on Fair Use
issues in the course of granting

00:11:42.180 --> 00:11:45.150
or denying exemptions is
that something that you feel

00:11:45.150 --> 00:11:48.150
like you can sort of take
the clients so to say here.

00:11:48.150 --> 00:11:49.450
Here's what the copyright
office thinks

00:11:49.450 --> 00:11:51.470
about these issues in this context?

00:11:51.470 --> 00:11:52.960
&gt;&gt; Shaun J. Bockert: I
think it's difficult to take

00:11:52.960 --> 00:11:55.310
without some qualification.

00:11:55.310 --> 00:11:59.390
You know we look at the section
1201 ruling you know Rule 21 that's

00:11:59.390 --> 00:12:03.210
dealing exactly in the automotive
industry and it does say things

00:12:03.210 --> 00:12:06.990
like it says something along the
line of these may be fair uses

00:12:06.990 --> 00:12:11.440 position:56%
under 107 or it may be a
non-infringing use under Section 117

00:12:11.440 --> 00:12:14.070
and sure that's something like
that's good to go to a client

00:12:14.070 --> 00:12:17.130
and say, there may be
some support here in rule

00:12:17.130 --> 00:12:19.640
in a totally different
context but how you import

00:12:19.640 --> 00:12:23.480
that to you know there is very
clearly something under 107

00:12:23.480 --> 00:12:27.460
that you can build your business on
I think it's a different question.

00:12:27.460 --> 00:12:28.760
&gt;&gt; Catherine Rowland: Mr. Lowe.

00:12:28.760 --> 00:12:34.460
&gt;&gt; Aaron Lowe: So I want to
build on Mr. Bergmayer's point

00:12:34.460 --> 00:12:41.000
of the importance of being able
to research software and that look

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:44.820
at the Volkswagen case where if
you couldn't go into that software

00:12:44.820 --> 00:12:47.870
and understand where the problem
was you never would have discovered

00:12:47.870 --> 00:12:49.400
that there was a major issue

00:12:49.400 --> 00:12:52.860
with the way Volkswagen had
configured its software.

00:12:52.860 --> 00:12:58.590
Our industry goes into parts
all the time and OE parts

00:12:58.590 --> 00:13:02.370
and deconstructs them and finds
where there are problems, defects,

00:13:02.370 --> 00:13:04.480
issues with the original
part, correct them

00:13:04.480 --> 00:13:05.920
and when the part is sold

00:13:05.920 --> 00:13:10.610 position:56%
as an aftermarket part it has now a
corrected issue on it and it's safer

00:13:10.610 --> 00:13:13.120
or more environmentally
responsible than the car,

00:13:13.120 --> 00:13:14.780
the part that came off
the vehicle manufacturer

00:13:14.780 --> 00:13:19.110
so it's a really important
part of the Fair Use doctrine.

00:13:19.110 --> 00:13:20.410
&gt;&gt; Catherine Rowland:
And so you're happy

00:13:20.410 --> 00:13:25.410 position:56%
with the way the courts are treating
Fair Use with reverse of software

00:13:25.410 --> 00:13:29.510
to repair things and what
not and to just do repairs?

00:13:29.510 --> 00:13:31.990
&gt;&gt; Aaron Lowe: Yeah and I
think that has to be you know,

00:13:31.990 --> 00:13:37.140
it has to be clear that that
is available to be done.

00:13:37.140 --> 00:13:40.880
&gt;&gt; Catherine Rowland: How would
you suggest that being clarified

00:13:40.880 --> 00:13:44.890
with legislation, with
like what sort of changes?

00:13:44.890 --> 00:13:46.940
&gt;&gt; Aaron Lowe: I'm not sure that
legislation would be necessary

00:13:46.940 --> 00:13:50.860
but I'm also not a lawyer so, I
think this whole table this side

00:13:50.860 --> 00:13:53.090
of the table was shortchanged
on lawyers.

00:13:53.090 --> 00:13:55.500
&gt;&gt; Catherine Rowland: Mr.
Kupferschmid is a lawyer there.

00:13:55.500 --> 00:13:57.600
&gt;&gt; Mr. Kupferschmid: That's
not necessarily a bad thing.

00:13:57.600 --> 00:13:58.900
&gt;&gt; Aaron Lowe.

00:13:58.900 --> 00:14:00.200
Yeah.

00:14:00.200 --> 00:14:01.500
&gt;&gt; Catherine Rowland:
Mr. Perzanowski.

00:14:01.500 --> 00:14:05.530
Oh, I'm sorry Mr. Harbeson.

00:14:05.530 --> 00:14:11.280
&gt;&gt; Eric Harbeson: So I want to
clarify something I said earlier

00:14:11.280 --> 00:14:15.070
and just to make sure
that I was not saying

00:14:15.070 --> 00:14:17.440
that I didn't think
that Fair Use applied.

00:14:17.440 --> 00:14:20.470
I think that the problem is
not that Fair Use doesn't apply

00:14:20.470 --> 00:14:23.450
and I've been hearing a
lot of examples of things

00:14:23.450 --> 00:14:30.570
that I think are easily and
the Courts to the extent

00:14:30.570 --> 00:14:36.940
that I've been following software
have applied Fair Use the problem

00:14:36.940 --> 00:14:39.220
with as I understand
it with Fair Use

00:14:39.220 --> 00:14:43.960
in software enabled consumer
products and any software is

00:14:43.960 --> 00:14:46.730
that you have to find
yourself within the scope

00:14:46.730 --> 00:14:49.320
of Title 17 before
you can use Fair Use.

00:14:49.320 --> 00:14:53.060
At least that's my understanding.

00:14:53.060 --> 00:14:59.180 position:56%
The conventional knowledge anyway is
that a contract will override those

00:14:59.180 --> 00:15:03.840
and so I still kind of see
the problem with Fair Use.

00:15:03.840 --> 00:15:10.410
My feeling with that the reason
that Fair Use is being talked

00:15:10.410 --> 00:15:14.870
about here is because
of the conflict

00:15:14.870 --> 00:15:20.920
between what is Fair Use once
you're within the scope of Title 17

00:15:20.920 --> 00:15:26.910
versus what software
licenses tell you is not okay

00:15:26.910 --> 00:15:29.810
and so can you actually
apply Fair Use

00:15:29.810 --> 00:15:33.160
when the license that
you signed is not?

00:15:33.160 --> 00:15:39.590
And if you know if Fair Use
is a defense against a breach

00:15:39.590 --> 00:15:45.290
of contract then I can go
home because I can tell,

00:15:45.290 --> 00:15:50.320
I could tell my membership
that we can rely on Fair Use.

00:15:50.320 --> 00:15:52.410
But I don't think that we can.

00:15:52.410 --> 00:15:59.690
And so we would be very happy
if we could rely on Fair Use

00:15:59.690 --> 00:16:04.120
to make the works that we're
trying to get access to available.

00:16:04.120 --> 00:16:06.260
&gt;&gt; Sy Damle: I mean
the premise I guess is

00:16:06.260 --> 00:16:09.460
that you have essentially been
required or you have agreed

00:16:09.460 --> 00:16:11.860
to waive Fair Use by contract.

00:16:11.860 --> 00:16:13.950
Is that what you're saying?

00:16:13.950 --> 00:16:18.210
&gt;&gt; Eric Harbeson: Well right,
let's pretend for a moment

00:16:18.210 --> 00:16:21.090
that libraries could enter into
the agreements that I'm taking

00:16:21.090 --> 00:16:25.510
about which are not unlike
the software licenses.

00:16:25.510 --> 00:16:28.870
You know the very similar
language in iTunes that you'll find

00:16:28.870 --> 00:16:32.930
in software and I actually, I
read the software agreements a lot

00:16:32.930 --> 00:16:35.670
so you know I've seen
a lot of similarity.

00:16:35.670 --> 00:16:41.600
Once you agree to that license
you're waiving the right

00:16:41.600 --> 00:16:45.560
to do things that Fair
Use would permit you to do

00:16:45.560 --> 00:16:53.330
and you know the same thing is true
with 109 which we'll get to later

00:16:53.330 --> 00:16:58.330
but so I think a lot of the
problem is in that conflict

00:16:58.330 --> 00:17:05.380 position:56%
between what would clearly be a Fair
Use and then what you're agreeing

00:17:05.380 --> 00:17:11.930
to by a non-negotiable contract
not to be allowed to do.

00:17:11.930 --> 00:17:17.330
So again, we would be very,
very happy to argue Fair Use

00:17:17.330 --> 00:17:19.110
for the things that we want to do.

00:17:19.110 --> 00:17:21.260
I think that many of the
examples that are brought

00:17:21.260 --> 00:17:26.320
up would be a very easy case
but I'm not even sure we can get

00:17:26.320 --> 00:17:29.620
to a Fair Use question until
we resolve this problem

00:17:29.620 --> 00:17:33.020
with not even being
subject to Title 17.

00:17:33.020 --> 00:17:40.730
Our proposal is for a
quasi -copyright provision

00:17:40.730 --> 00:17:43.640
within the copyright law which
is I mean there's part of it

00:17:43.640 --> 00:17:47.670
in Chapters 11 and 13 that would

00:17:47.670 --> 00:17:57.030
that would give us an very narrow
exclusion from the copyright

00:17:57.030 --> 00:18:00.890
from the contact in the case where
something is not made available.

00:18:00.890 --> 00:18:05.480
Something similar could be drafted
for a software but I really think

00:18:05.480 --> 00:18:10.000
that as long as we're talking
about Fair Use and not talking

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:11.740
about the contract
we're missing the point.

00:18:11.740 --> 00:18:13.040
&gt;&gt; Catherine Rowland: I'm sorry.

00:18:13.040 --> 00:18:16.730
I mean I realize that other people
have their cards up but I wanted

00:18:16.730 --> 00:18:21.030
to see if Mr. Kupferschmid or
Mr. Zuck had any thoughts on that

00:18:21.030 --> 00:18:24.620
from about the intersection of
contract law and the Fair Use

00:18:24.620 --> 00:18:29.490
and how they work together
or do not?

00:18:29.490 --> 00:18:33.610
&gt;&gt; Jonathan Zuck: Well, I mean
I guess there's two levels

00:18:33.610 --> 00:18:37.020 position:56%
that I question, one that's innately
that I'm probably unqualified

00:18:37.020 --> 00:18:40.880
to answer and another that's more
practical and the first thing

00:18:40.880 --> 00:18:45.140
that struck me when listening to
you is that I'm not even sure,

00:18:45.140 --> 00:18:49.140
I'm not completely sure
of the intersection

00:18:49.140 --> 00:18:51.630
between library use
and Fair Use, right?

00:18:51.630 --> 00:18:55.750 position:56%
It's a little bit of a different
kind of use than at least the things

00:18:55.750 --> 00:18:58.430
that I'm familiar with in
the context of Fair Use

00:18:58.430 --> 00:19:00.820
but I also think it's
a practical matter.

00:19:00.820 --> 00:19:02.120
That there have been plenty

00:19:02.120 --> 00:19:10.110
of license agreements have been
violated and that have been --

00:19:10.110 --> 00:19:16.360 position:56%
but the basis for the enforcement of
that contract was in fact copyright

00:19:16.360 --> 00:19:19.460
and that therefore the
license was obviated

00:19:19.460 --> 00:19:21.590
in the, in favor of Fair Use.

00:19:21.590 --> 00:19:26.330
So I feel like you do have those,
Fair Use has taken precedence more

00:19:26.330 --> 00:19:30.950
so than not over contract
or license provisions.

00:19:30.950 --> 00:19:34.080
As far as I can tell it's a
practical matter and whether

00:19:34.080 --> 00:19:37.120
or not I think that's innately
the case I don't know the answer

00:19:37.120 --> 00:19:42.970
but I'm also, I'm just also again
maybe under-informed but I feel

00:19:42.970 --> 00:19:45.740
like the provisions
of law that have to do

00:19:45.740 --> 00:19:49.680
with library type functions are
different than the ones that have

00:19:49.680 --> 00:19:52.800
to do with Fair Use that
have to do with making use

00:19:52.800 --> 00:19:56.390
of a particular copyrighted work

00:19:56.390 --> 00:19:58.400
and so maybe I'm just
confused about that.

00:19:58.400 --> 00:20:02.610
I apologize if I am.

00:20:02.610 --> 00:20:05.470
&gt;&gt; Keith Kupferschmid: So I think
we've, it seems like at least

00:20:05.470 --> 00:20:07.680
in this discussion we've
gotten a little far afield

00:20:07.680 --> 00:20:10.780
from the discussion
about imbedded software

00:20:10.780 --> 00:20:16.580
in everyday consumer products and
so and to a more general discussion

00:20:16.580 --> 00:20:23.150
of Fair Use or whether APIs are
protectable or who's the author

00:20:23.150 --> 00:20:26.140
of machina and a whole bunch
of other things and a lot

00:20:26.140 --> 00:20:30.390
of these issues do come down to and
I think probably will be discussed

00:20:30.390 --> 00:20:34.920
in more detail in the
1201 study I think

00:20:34.920 --> 00:20:37.910
because that's I think probably
where Fair Use probably comes in,

00:20:37.910 --> 00:20:40.830
is more to play is evidenced
I think by your questions

00:20:40.830 --> 00:20:45.480
about the tri-annual
rulemaking and what have you.

00:20:45.480 --> 00:20:47.880
Mr. Harbeson mentioned the fact

00:20:47.880 --> 00:20:51.420
that you know whether Fair Use is a
defense against breach of contract.

00:20:51.420 --> 00:20:54.450
I don't think that's what we were
talking about on the first panel.

00:20:54.450 --> 00:20:56.810
I don't know if that's what
he was referring to or not

00:20:56.810 --> 00:21:01.250 position:56%
but we were talking about whether
if a court held there to be Fair Use

00:21:01.250 --> 00:21:06.150 position:56%
but your contract said that you
could not engage in Fair Use whether

00:21:06.150 --> 00:21:08.430
that would be a copyright
infringement which is different,

00:21:08.430 --> 00:21:15.590
which is a different question so I
think just needed to clarify that.

00:21:15.590 --> 00:21:20.100
&gt;&gt; Catherine Rowland: Thank you
and I think Mr. Perzanowski.

00:21:20.100 --> 00:21:23.100
&gt;&gt; Aaron Perzanowski: So I
just wanted to note the ways

00:21:23.100 --> 00:21:27.490
in which I think this discussion
about Fair Use is related

00:21:27.490 --> 00:21:30.220
to the discussion we had
on the last panel, right?

00:21:30.220 --> 00:21:35.410
So Fair Use and this question of
ownership are sometimes intertwined

00:21:35.410 --> 00:21:39.270
in interesting ways and you can
look back at some Fair Use cases

00:21:39.270 --> 00:21:41.520
where I think you can
see this really clearly.

00:21:41.520 --> 00:21:46.160
I think the most clear
example is the Galoob case.

00:21:46.160 --> 00:21:49.650
In the Galoob case the Court talks

00:21:49.650 --> 00:21:52.830
in really explicit
terms about ownership.

00:21:52.830 --> 00:21:57.620
It discusses the single recovery
theory that undergirds exhaustion

00:21:57.620 --> 00:22:02.260
and it talks about the
right to modify a product

00:22:02.260 --> 00:22:06.780
that a consumer owns
once it has been sold.

00:22:06.780 --> 00:22:09.740
There are other cases where I think
you can see the same kind of focus

00:22:09.740 --> 00:22:14.420 position:56%
on the question of ownership at work
in the Fair Use analysis itself.

00:22:14.420 --> 00:22:20.520
I think if you compare you know
the rationales and outcomes in Sega

00:22:20.520 --> 00:22:26.060
versus Accolade and Atari versus
Nintendo ownership is also at work

00:22:26.060 --> 00:22:32.490
in the background there and I've
written about this at some length

00:22:32.490 --> 00:22:37.160
and I think part of the reason you
see ownership considerations kind

00:22:37.160 --> 00:22:39.770
of sneaking into the
Fair Use analysis.

00:22:39.770 --> 00:22:41.260
Sneaking isn't the right word.

00:22:41.260 --> 00:22:43.260
I don't think it's
inappropriate for courts

00:22:43.260 --> 00:22:47.190
to consider additional factors
beyond the four statutory factors

00:22:47.190 --> 00:22:51.470
but we don't expect to see
ownership come up in that context

00:22:51.470 --> 00:22:59.820 position:56%
and I think it's because courts have
been uncomfortable relying purely

00:22:59.820 --> 00:23:03.840
on the kind of exhaustion doctrines
in 109 and 117 for the reasons

00:23:03.840 --> 00:23:06.570
that we were talking about
before, so there's an interplay

00:23:06.570 --> 00:23:08.930 position:56%
between these two sets of questions.

00:23:08.930 --> 00:23:11.250
I wanted to come back to a point

00:23:11.250 --> 00:23:14.140
that John made earlier
about security testing.

00:23:14.140 --> 00:23:18.310
About a decade ago I represented
Academic Security Researchers

00:23:18.310 --> 00:23:23.910 position:56%
who were working on the Sony BMG
Rootkit a scandal that I'm sure many

00:23:23.910 --> 00:23:30.050
of you remember and I can
say firsthand how worries

00:23:30.050 --> 00:23:35.830
about copyright infringement
liability influenced the decision

00:23:35.830 --> 00:23:42.340
to undertake research, the pace
at which that research is executed

00:23:42.340 --> 00:23:44.440
and decisions about when and how

00:23:44.440 --> 00:23:47.090
that research is disclosed
to the public.

00:23:47.090 --> 00:23:54.480
So I think it's crucial that we
have you know some greater degree

00:23:54.480 --> 00:23:59.410
of clarity not only for
individual consumers but people

00:23:59.410 --> 00:24:03.290
who are doing research
on consumer products

00:24:03.290 --> 00:24:14.770
because frankly Fair Use is not, is
not providing lawyers with the kind

00:24:14.770 --> 00:24:18.910
of certainty that they need to
communicate to clients in order

00:24:18.910 --> 00:24:22.160
to make sure that this really
important work happens.

00:24:22.160 --> 00:24:25.940
&gt;&gt; Sy Damle: So I'm sorry
to keep mentioning 1201.

00:24:25.940 --> 00:24:27.320
I know there's another
study about that

00:24:27.320 --> 00:24:30.300
but I mean just going back
it's sort of a version

00:24:30.300 --> 00:24:33.030
of a question I asked Mr.
Bockert which is you know

00:24:33.030 --> 00:24:38.330
in the last rulemaking we adopted
an exemption for security research

00:24:38.330 --> 00:24:43.010
and you know to sort of refine
the question you know the premise

00:24:43.010 --> 00:24:46.490
of us granting that exemption
is that the activities covered

00:24:46.490 --> 00:24:50.730
by the exemption are in some
way non-infringing and so,

00:24:50.730 --> 00:24:54.380
so there is some at least
guidance from the copyright office

00:24:54.380 --> 00:24:57.970
and from the Library about
what activities it considers

00:24:57.970 --> 00:25:01.250
to be non-infringing in some level

00:25:01.250 --> 00:25:07.160
and so I'm just curious
why you know sort

00:25:07.160 --> 00:25:09.690
of researchers can
couldn't rely on that.

00:25:09.690 --> 00:25:11.600
&gt;&gt; Aaron Perzanowski: I would not
be comfortable going into court

00:25:11.600 --> 00:25:13.870
in litigation and saying that the
copyright office said this was a

00:25:13.870 --> 00:25:15.170
Fair Use.

00:25:15.170 --> 00:25:17.280
I don't think that's going
to get you very far, right.

00:25:17.280 --> 00:25:23.880 position:56%
That is not, that's not a sufficient
basis for drawing the conclusion

00:25:23.880 --> 00:25:26.810
that a particular use is fair
and I don't think that those

00:25:26.810 --> 00:25:30.140
from what I recall from the
rulemakings we don't get sort

00:25:30.140 --> 00:25:35.410
of crystal clear statements that
these are in fact fair uses, right?

00:25:35.410 --> 00:25:40.880 position:56%
We get understandably and I think
with good reason cautious statements

00:25:40.880 --> 00:25:45.690
about how we should interpret
these kinds of behaviors.

00:25:45.690 --> 00:25:48.030
The other thing that I would
say about the rulemaking

00:25:48.030 --> 00:25:53.750
and I participated in that
process back in the 2006 Rulemaking

00:25:53.750 --> 00:25:58.310
and we got an exemption
for, a very narrow exemption

00:25:58.310 --> 00:26:02.850
for security research related to
DRM on music CDs that created risks

00:26:02.850 --> 00:26:06.970
for security and you know talking
about looking at the problems

00:26:06.970 --> 00:26:09.820
of yesterday, by the time
we got that exemption

00:26:09.820 --> 00:26:12.600
through it served no
function, right.

00:26:12.600 --> 00:26:14.330
It didn't do anything at that point

00:26:14.330 --> 00:26:20.100
so the rulemaking process is
necessarily a backward looking

00:26:20.100 --> 00:26:23.920 position:56%
process and I can understand why I
think this copyright office has been

00:26:23.920 --> 00:26:29.210
understandably demanding in
terms of the evidentiary record

00:26:29.210 --> 00:26:31.640
that it requires in
terms of a showing

00:26:31.640 --> 00:26:36.100
of concrete harm before
an exemption is issued

00:26:36.100 --> 00:26:39.200
but in many cases especially
when we're taking about software,

00:26:39.200 --> 00:26:41.460
right which we know is
this fast moving industry

00:26:41.460 --> 00:26:49.350
where things change quickly, the
rulemakings have not resulted

00:26:49.350 --> 00:26:51.820
in the kind of forward
looking clarity

00:26:51.820 --> 00:26:55.370
that I think is often necessary.

00:26:55.370 --> 00:26:57.390
&gt;&gt; Catherine Rowland: I'd like to
ask a follow-up question about that

00:26:57.390 --> 00:27:00.360
and your discussion of Fair
Use and the uncertainty.

00:27:00.360 --> 00:27:04.030
I don't think that that is
really unique to software

00:27:04.030 --> 00:27:07.520
so that whole point of Fair
Use is it has to be flexible

00:27:07.520 --> 00:27:11.300
and fact specific so can
address each case on its merits

00:27:11.300 --> 00:27:16.560
so if the whole problem is
uncertainty what would you suggest

00:27:16.560 --> 00:27:21.220
because is Fair Use not going to
be sufficient in your opinion or?

00:27:21.220 --> 00:27:23.020
&gt;&gt; Aaron Perzanowski: Yeah, so
I think the way that you address

00:27:23.020 --> 00:27:26.110
that uncertainty is by fixing
the problems that we talked

00:27:26.110 --> 00:27:30.070
about in the prior panel, so
again Fair Use is going to be kind

00:27:30.070 --> 00:27:34.590 position:56%
of the defense of last resort in
these kinds of cases if the standard

00:27:34.590 --> 00:27:39.810 position:56%
for what counts is ownership is
clarified and people can rely on 117

00:27:39.810 --> 00:27:44.590
for example, I think that
addresses many although not all

00:27:44.590 --> 00:27:50.470
of the circumstances where we
might otherwise be you know telling

00:27:50.470 --> 00:27:54.970
clients to focus their
efforts on Fair Use.

00:27:54.970 --> 00:27:56.270
&gt;&gt; Catherine Rowland: Thank you.

00:27:56.270 --> 00:27:57.570
Mr. Band.

00:27:57.570 --> 00:27:59.120
&gt;&gt; Jonathan Band: So
I just want the build

00:27:59.120 --> 00:28:06.390
on what Mr. Harbeson was saying in
bringing it back to inoperability

00:28:06.390 --> 00:28:10.550
and Fair Use in the context
of software enabled products.

00:28:10.550 --> 00:28:13.270
So as we had talked
about in earlier panel,

00:28:13.270 --> 00:28:19.200
many license software license
agreements do have a prohibition

00:28:19.200 --> 00:28:21.940
on reverse engineering
and then the question is,

00:28:21.940 --> 00:28:25.730
is that prohibition
enforceable or is it preempted

00:28:25.730 --> 00:28:28.600
or is it somehow seen as
a contract of adhesion

00:28:28.600 --> 00:28:31.890
and not enforceable for
that reason or what?

00:28:31.890 --> 00:28:35.960
But the point is that
there are certainly

00:28:35.960 --> 00:28:41.400
in the computer industry
you typically see these

00:28:41.400 --> 00:28:43.370
contract restrictions.

00:28:43.370 --> 00:28:46.600
Now it could very well be that
so far in the automotive industry

00:28:46.600 --> 00:28:49.680
that hasn't been a problem
and so it hasn't been sort

00:28:49.680 --> 00:28:55.050
of like therefore a problem
in the 1201 rulemaking context

00:28:55.050 --> 00:28:58.310
in this last tri-annual cycle.

00:28:58.310 --> 00:29:04.220
But it certainly isn't, I
can certainly imagine it

00:29:04.220 --> 00:29:07.470
and I don't want to give the
automotive industry any ideas,

00:29:07.470 --> 00:29:09.610
I mean the car manufacturers
any ideas.

00:29:09.610 --> 00:29:11.620
I'm sure they've thought about
this but it could very well be

00:29:11.620 --> 00:29:16.050
that you know maybe in the
near future when you're signing

00:29:16.050 --> 00:29:19.410
that stack of papers when you're
buying the car and there's a lot

00:29:19.410 --> 00:29:22.060 position:56%
of papers that you're just routinely
signing that it could very well be

00:29:22.060 --> 00:29:24.490
that there will be in that stack

00:29:24.490 --> 00:29:27.160
of papers some software
license agreement

00:29:27.160 --> 00:29:33.090
that then will cause all the
problems that we haven't seen yet.

00:29:33.090 --> 00:29:38.420
Right now, so now it's just you
know it's a Fair Use problem.

00:29:38.420 --> 00:29:40.430
Can you engage in the
reverse engineering necessary

00:29:40.430 --> 00:29:42.860
to make the replacement part?

00:29:42.860 --> 00:29:47.000
But I can see in the
very near future

00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:51.480
that it will also be a license
problem not just a Fair Use problem

00:29:51.480 --> 00:29:56.120 position:56%
and so again I think the opportunity
of the study here so to sort

00:29:56.120 --> 00:29:59.770
of get ahead of the curve and
see what's coming down the road

00:29:59.770 --> 00:30:01.130
and say okay how do we make sure ?

00:30:01.130 --> 00:30:05.500 position:56%
I mean because we were, certainly in
the automotive you know we're taking

00:30:05.500 --> 00:30:09.630
about a huge aftermarket in the
automotive industry and then

00:30:09.630 --> 00:30:13.030
if you include agriculture
and yachts and everything else

00:30:13.030 --> 00:30:17.950
and you know I mean the aftermarket
generally is an enormous area

00:30:17.950 --> 00:30:23.520
and as more software is included
this you know whether it's Fair Use

00:30:23.520 --> 00:30:25.580
or a contractual restriction on it

00:30:25.580 --> 00:30:29.910
or on reverse engineering this
problem is going to be only going

00:30:29.910 --> 00:30:31.720
to get bigger and not smaller.

00:30:31.720 --> 00:30:33.020
&gt;&gt; Catherine Rowland: Thank you.

00:30:33.020 --> 00:30:34.580
Mr. Bockert.

00:30:34.580 --> 00:30:38.680
&gt;&gt; Shaun Bockert: So I take it the
you know where this is going is one

00:30:38.680 --> 00:30:40.890
of the questions is,
is Fair Use enough?

00:30:40.890 --> 00:30:43.130
Like does that resolve all
the concerns that we've talk

00:30:43.130 --> 00:30:45.400
about in our first two
panels and probably will talk

00:30:45.400 --> 00:30:47.340
about in this the fourth one?

00:30:47.340 --> 00:30:51.330
And I think the answer has
to be no, we want to clarify

00:30:51.330 --> 00:30:54.620
that certain things qualify
as non-infringing uses

00:30:54.620 --> 00:30:59.200
and we don't want to rely on just
advising clients to say yeah,

00:30:59.200 --> 00:31:03.280 position:56%
this is probably a Fair Use and then
pointing to very fact specific cases

00:31:03.280 --> 00:31:07.700
that are probably distinguishable
in some ways from the ones at hand

00:31:07.700 --> 00:31:10.290
so I think the answer is
no, Fair Use is not enough.

00:31:10.290 --> 00:31:12.080
&gt;&gt; Catherine Rowland:
I find that kind of,

00:31:12.080 --> 00:31:13.430
I just find that interesting

00:31:13.430 --> 00:31:15.950
because earlier I don't know Mr.
Lowe was saying that he was happy

00:31:15.950 --> 00:31:20.010 position:56%
with the way Fair Use was going with
the repair in reverse engineering.

00:31:20.010 --> 00:31:21.310
I wonder if you had any of that.

00:31:21.310 --> 00:31:25.020
&gt;&gt; Aaron Lowe: Well I mean this is
the big issue that Mr. Band brought

00:31:25.020 --> 00:31:26.870
up is that we're moving down a road

00:31:26.870 --> 00:31:33.090
where we're the situations are
changing and what I said was

00:31:33.090 --> 00:31:36.960
that I wasn't clear as a lawyer
that we're satisfied with --

00:31:36.960 --> 00:31:39.890
we're satisfied with that per se
but I think you know the issue

00:31:39.890 --> 00:31:42.790
that was brought up by Mr.
Bockert is true that we need

00:31:42.790 --> 00:31:45.220
to resolve all these issues
before we get to Fair Use

00:31:45.220 --> 00:31:47.840
and that we brought
up in the last panel.

00:31:47.840 --> 00:31:49.140
&gt;&gt; Catherine Rowland: Thank you.

00:31:49.140 --> 00:31:50.440
Mr. Zuck.

00:31:50.440 --> 00:31:54.560
&gt;&gt; Jonathan Zuck: Yes, two things I
guess one just again just a matter

00:31:54.560 --> 00:31:55.860
of fact.

00:31:55.860 --> 00:31:58.390
I think the DMCA is at least
a step in the direction

00:31:58.390 --> 00:32:02.690
of having codified things in a
very direct way legislatively

00:32:02.690 --> 00:32:04.480
that you're not just
reliant on looking

00:32:04.480 --> 00:32:06.930
at fact specific cases
described Fair Use.

00:32:06.930 --> 00:32:12.050 position:56%
There are specific practices in
DMCA that are outlined as being okay

00:32:12.050 --> 00:32:17.630
in non-infringing uses, so it seems
to me there's already something

00:32:17.630 --> 00:32:19.620
in place that's had good effect.

00:32:19.620 --> 00:32:22.930
The other question again taking
a step back from this is that --

00:32:22.930 --> 00:32:24.920
&gt;&gt; I'm sorry so you're
speaking specifically

00:32:24.920 --> 00:32:27.960
about the reverse engineering,
like the permanent exemptions?

00:32:27.960 --> 00:32:29.800
Is that what you're talking
about like as being sort

00:32:29.800 --> 00:32:31.100
of guidance about what's --

00:32:31.100 --> 00:32:32.400
&gt;&gt; Jonathan Zuck: Right,

00:32:32.400 --> 00:32:35.750
that's right I mean there's
ten I think exemptions in there

00:32:35.750 --> 00:32:39.830
that educational purposes
for interoperability.

00:32:39.830 --> 00:32:41.420
Security is one, etcetera.

00:32:41.420 --> 00:32:45.480
Those things were built into the
DMCA from the get-go legislatively

00:32:45.480 --> 00:32:51.010
and so you're not reliant just on
Fair Use as a judicial precedent.

00:32:51.010 --> 00:32:56.410
Okay, so the other issue that I
don't know the best way to put this

00:32:56.410 --> 00:32:58.070
but there's a kind of presumption

00:32:58.070 --> 00:33:01.270
that if I have some new idea
it should be okay and it's bad

00:33:01.270 --> 00:33:05.850 position:56%
that the answer might be no and I
guess, I don't mean to be the Grinch

00:33:05.850 --> 00:33:08.280
in the room but as the
copyright holder I'm okay

00:33:08.280 --> 00:33:11.000
with the default answer being no.

00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:14.350
I think it should be the
exception and not the rule

00:33:14.350 --> 00:33:17.870
that if some new use is Fair
Use and so I mean that we need

00:33:17.870 --> 00:33:20.590
to take a step back and
that we have a decision

00:33:20.590 --> 00:33:24.410
like the Dr. Zeus decision that
in many ways speaks to this notion

00:33:24.410 --> 00:33:28.750
that you're using my copyrighted
characters to create some new work

00:33:28.750 --> 00:33:31.760
that I had as some downstream
implication to their use.

00:33:31.760 --> 00:33:35.540
There's a huge market for 3D models
that are used in films and things

00:33:35.540 --> 00:33:38.400
like that that you license
under different licensing terms

00:33:38.400 --> 00:33:41.290
for different types of
commercial and non-commercial use.

00:33:41.290 --> 00:33:43.460
It's not you know,
I don't think it's

00:33:43.460 --> 00:33:46.820 position:56%
as mystical as it's being portrayed.

00:33:46.820 --> 00:33:51.810 position:56%
What's mystical is I think I've come
up with some creative new way to get

00:33:51.810 --> 00:33:54.980
around the way that this has
been interpreted in the past.

00:33:54.980 --> 00:33:58.080
You, Mr. Lawyer do you feel
like you could defend this?

00:33:58.080 --> 00:33:59.990
And the answer is I don't know.

00:33:59.990 --> 00:34:04.220
I think that 99% of the time
the answer is far more clear

00:34:04.220 --> 00:34:08.800
and that the answer is in fact
no and I'm comfortable with that

00:34:08.800 --> 00:34:12.410
and I don't think that we should
necessarily shy away from the fact

00:34:12.410 --> 00:34:16.850
that the de facto answer is the
copyright holder should have you

00:34:16.850 --> 00:34:21.320
know the last say and not
my you know new creative use

00:34:21.320 --> 00:34:24.290
for someone else's work.

00:34:24.290 --> 00:34:25.630 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Catherine Rowland: Mr. Bergmayer.

00:34:25.630 --> 00:34:28.630
&gt;&gt; John Bergmayer: Yeah so
there's even among people

00:34:28.630 --> 00:34:31.600
who are broadly aligned with me

00:34:31.600 --> 00:34:34.230
on copyright issues there's
sometimes disagreement

00:34:34.230 --> 00:34:36.350
about you know Fair
Use versus clear,

00:34:36.350 --> 00:34:39.820 position:56%
safe harbors because the challenge
is if you list out a bunch of clear,

00:34:39.820 --> 00:34:43.620
safe harbors then the fear would
be well people will always confine

00:34:43.620 --> 00:34:46.420
their behavior just to those
safe harbors or a judge might

00:34:46.420 --> 00:34:49.290
of find a behavior that falls
just outside of safe harbor

00:34:49.290 --> 00:34:52.440 position:56%
as more likely to not be a Fair Use.

00:34:52.440 --> 00:34:55.740 position:56%
However, I think just as a practical
matter I think it's pretty clear

00:34:55.740 --> 00:35:00.080
that certain kinds of behavior out
to be just considered very clearly

00:35:00.080 --> 00:35:04.490
to be non-infringing either
through an extremely clear

00:35:04.490 --> 00:35:06.680
and universally applicable
Fair Use precedent

00:35:06.680 --> 00:35:10.460
or through a statutory safe harbor
or otherwise and sort of even

00:35:10.460 --> 00:35:13.050
with the downside that it
might sort of cause people

00:35:13.050 --> 00:35:15.690
to shift their behavior slightly
to conform with the safe harbor,

00:35:15.690 --> 00:35:18.250
I think the up-side
will probably be good.

00:35:18.250 --> 00:35:21.100
That being said I also think in
the imbedded software context

00:35:21.100 --> 00:35:24.730
in particular there's other
doctrines which already can exist

00:35:24.730 --> 00:35:26.190
which often get short shrift.

00:35:26.190 --> 00:35:28.950
I brought up in an earlier
panel functionality.

00:35:28.950 --> 00:35:32.800
I think some imbedded
software the functionality

00:35:32.800 --> 00:35:35.840
or idea expression might
make it copy writable

00:35:35.840 --> 00:35:38.370
or at least you wouldn't be
able to challenge someone

00:35:38.370 --> 00:35:40.590
who makes another piece of
software doing the same thing

00:35:40.590 --> 00:35:42.020
because there's no
other way to do it.

00:35:42.020 --> 00:35:43.320
&gt;&gt; Sy Damle: I'm sorry
so you're talking

00:35:43.320 --> 00:35:45.310
about like merger and [inaudible].

00:35:45.310 --> 00:35:46.610
&gt;&gt; John Bergmayer: Yes, exactly.

00:35:46.610 --> 00:35:50.580
I think in some of the most extreme
cases of very simple software

00:35:50.580 --> 00:35:53.700
and a micro-controller that's just
doing a physical function I think

00:35:53.700 --> 00:35:56.580
those doctrines which often
don't get any discussion at all

00:35:56.580 --> 00:36:01.270
in like artistic works cases
might actually be very important.

00:36:01.270 --> 00:36:03.930
I think de minimis
use that's a doctrine

00:36:03.930 --> 00:36:06.490
which almost never gets
litigated but I think

00:36:06.490 --> 00:36:13.470
that also might be applicable in
some circumstances so that's it.

00:36:13.470 --> 00:36:17.460
&gt;&gt; Sy Damle: So you said that
there were some uses or activities

00:36:17.460 --> 00:36:20.780
that you feel should be
considered to be Fair Use

00:36:20.780 --> 00:36:22.710
across the board you
know categorically.

00:36:22.710 --> 00:36:24.790
Are there's any in particular
with respect to software

00:36:24.790 --> 00:36:27.530
and imbedded devices
that come to mind?

00:36:27.530 --> 00:36:30.310 position:56%
&gt;&gt; John Bergmayer: Well the examples
brought up before security research

00:36:30.310 --> 00:36:33.390
which typically comes up in the
anti- circumvention circumstance

00:36:33.390 --> 00:36:35.320
as opposed to the infringement
context.

00:36:35.320 --> 00:36:39.480 position:56%
I think that is a very clear example
where security research ought

00:36:39.480 --> 00:36:42.360
to categorically be non-infringing.

00:36:42.360 --> 00:36:44.270
I think you can do
it with a statute.

00:36:44.270 --> 00:36:45.860
You can do it with a
very clear precedent

00:36:45.860 --> 00:36:48.790 position:56%
that just makes broad sweeping
statements that like anyone can rely

00:36:48.790 --> 00:36:52.940 position:56%
on because they're crystal clear but
I think we need to have that result

00:36:52.940 --> 00:36:54.300
and we need to not just sort

00:36:54.300 --> 00:36:57.920
of have it just be a very fact
specific endeavor as to whether

00:36:57.920 --> 00:37:00.400
or not security research
is okay now but not

00:37:00.400 --> 00:37:02.980
in this circumstance,
things of that nature.

00:37:02.980 --> 00:37:05.260
You know haven't prepared
an exhaustive list of things

00:37:05.260 --> 00:37:07.860 position:56%
that I thought out to be categorical
fair uses I'm sure I can come

00:37:07.860 --> 00:37:10.200
up with a very long
list if you asked me to.

00:37:10.200 --> 00:37:13.290
Sy Damle: I mean so the precedent
point is an interesting one right

00:37:13.290 --> 00:37:15.640
because precedent requires there
to be someone who litigates

00:37:15.640 --> 00:37:18.670
and if there is sort of
just a general understanding

00:37:18.670 --> 00:37:23.620
that security research for instance
is Fair Use you're not going to get

00:37:23.620 --> 00:37:26.420
that precedent but at
the same time it's going

00:37:26.420 --> 00:37:29.480
to be clear enough just based
on industry practice that it is

00:37:29.480 --> 00:37:32.380
because lots of people do it
and no one sues, so is that,

00:37:32.380 --> 00:37:36.170
I mean is the absence of that
kind of litigation sufficient?

00:37:36.170 --> 00:37:41.560
&gt;&gt; John Bergmayer: In our very
litigious society I have trouble

00:37:41.560 --> 00:37:44.330
with the idea that there is a
theoretical legal right out there

00:37:44.330 --> 00:37:46.890
that someone could use to sue
someone that they had object

00:37:46.890 --> 00:37:49.930
to for commercial reasons but
we don't have to worry about it

00:37:49.930 --> 00:37:51.440
because no one has
ever used it before.

00:37:51.440 --> 00:37:54.870
I mean all these things are
not problems until they are so.

00:37:54.870 --> 00:37:56.170
&gt;&gt; But there is a lot of --

00:37:56.170 --> 00:37:57.470
&gt;&gt; John Bergmayer: Once there
is a legal overhang even

00:37:57.470 --> 00:37:59.940
if there's not litigation
there might not be litigation

00:37:59.940 --> 00:38:02.540
because people are avoiding,
engaging in the behavior

00:38:02.540 --> 00:38:05.960
that could lead to litigation so I
simply don't think that the absence

00:38:05.960 --> 00:38:09.110
of litigation is evidence
that there's not a problem

00:38:09.110 --> 00:38:11.240
because it could be still
affecting people's behavior

00:38:11.240 --> 00:38:13.830
but I think you might
better be talking to people

00:38:13.830 --> 00:38:17.100
who actually interact with clients
on a more direct basis than I do

00:38:17.100 --> 00:38:18.750
to get an answer to that question.

00:38:18.750 --> 00:38:20.130
&gt;&gt; Sy Damle: Yeah, but to take this

00:38:20.130 --> 00:38:24.520 position:56%
as a security research example
specifically I guess you could argue

00:38:24.520 --> 00:38:27.180
that there is sort of
marginally less security research

00:38:27.180 --> 00:38:28.790
than if we had a clear precedent

00:38:28.790 --> 00:38:31.370
but there is security
research that goes on now.

00:38:31.370 --> 00:38:34.010
I mean we had people testify
in the [inaudible] hearings.

00:38:34.010 --> 00:38:35.640
Again, sorry to mention [inaudible]

00:38:35.640 --> 00:38:37.760
about the research they
did on automobiles right.

00:38:37.760 --> 00:38:41.230
Charlie Miller came
to testify about that.

00:38:41.230 --> 00:38:48.400
If you know and if Chrysler want to
sue they could have and they didn't

00:38:48.400 --> 00:38:51.710
and I think at least that
gives like one data point

00:38:51.710 --> 00:38:53.240
in the absence sort of
in terms of absence.

00:38:53.240 --> 00:38:55.710
&gt;&gt; John Bergmayer: I believe there
were threats of in the recent,

00:38:55.710 --> 00:38:59.120
in the Jeep case you know where
the researchers demonstrated

00:38:59.120 --> 00:39:03.310
vulnerabilities of remotely turning
off a car that was on the road

00:39:03.310 --> 00:39:06.170
and those went away because there
was such as public attention

00:39:06.170 --> 00:39:09.940
to that is issue and often security
researchers are the kind of people

00:39:09.940 --> 00:39:13.990
who might welcome being, you
know it's a type that engages

00:39:13.990 --> 00:39:17.590
in that behavior but I don't
think we should rely on these sort

00:39:17.590 --> 00:39:21.280
of bravery and bravado of security
researchers who are willing to sort

00:39:21.280 --> 00:39:23.480
of stand up to the man
on a continual basis.

00:39:23.480 --> 00:39:27.310
I think these things just ought
to be excepted parts of society

00:39:27.310 --> 00:39:29.770
that simply don't carry
legal risk at all

00:39:29.770 --> 00:39:31.650
because they are so important.

00:39:31.650 --> 00:39:33.800
&gt;&gt; If I could just
add to that briefly

00:39:33.800 --> 00:39:36.530
and specifically in
the academic context.

00:39:36.530 --> 00:39:39.630
While security researchers
themselves might be willing

00:39:39.630 --> 00:39:44.160
to take risks university
general councils are not known

00:39:44.160 --> 00:39:51.210
for being big risk takers and their
willingness to back researchers

00:39:51.210 --> 00:39:58.780
who are engaging in work that might
draw litigation is rather limited

00:39:58.780 --> 00:40:04.580
and so you see that
influence not only the choice

00:40:04.580 --> 00:40:08.200
of specific research
projects to undertake

00:40:08.200 --> 00:40:11.120
but you know the long-term
trajectory

00:40:11.120 --> 00:40:15.040
of people's career what kind
of work are they going to do?

00:40:15.040 --> 00:40:17.640
What kind of researcher
are they going to be?

00:40:17.640 --> 00:40:23.780
And you know institutions, academic
institutions have a long memory

00:40:23.780 --> 00:40:27.420
for threats of litigation
that they've received

00:40:27.420 --> 00:40:29.180
and that other institutions
have received.

00:40:29.180 --> 00:40:35.680
They share that information and I
do think you have seen a change not

00:40:35.680 --> 00:40:40.270
only in the quantity but
also the nature of research

00:40:40.270 --> 00:40:44.650
that goes on in that space.

00:40:44.650 --> 00:40:46.870
&gt;&gt; Catherine Rowland: Okay,
we've got couple more people.

00:40:46.870 --> 00:40:49.280
I think Mr. Kupferschmid was next.

00:40:49.280 --> 00:40:50.580
&gt;&gt; Keith Kupferschmid:
Yeah, excuse me.

00:40:50.580 --> 00:40:51.880
I'll be brief.

00:40:51.880 --> 00:40:58.890
I mean it sounds like Mr. Bergmayer
was suggesting sort of you know

00:40:58.890 --> 00:41:01.940
with keeping the preamble we
have in 107 in getting rid

00:41:01.940 --> 00:41:05.900 position:56%
of the factors maybe I misunderstood
what he was saying you know in terms

00:41:05.900 --> 00:41:09.910
of just creating an exemption
for security researchers.

00:41:09.910 --> 00:41:12.300
So I apologize if I
misunderstood what you were saying

00:41:12.300 --> 00:41:15.820
but I think certainly whenever
you talk about Fair Use it's very,

00:41:15.820 --> 00:41:21.360
very context specific, fact
specific and we have to be very,

00:41:21.360 --> 00:41:26.570
very cautious if we move in any
particular direction in that area.

00:41:26.570 --> 00:41:31.300
I know that at the Copyright
Alliance we represent all sorts

00:41:31.300 --> 00:41:33.390
of different copyright
owners in different types

00:41:33.390 --> 00:41:38.120
of copyright disciplines and you
know they all rely on Fair Use

00:41:38.120 --> 00:41:43.730
and it's important to have a you
know a balanced Fair Use doctrine

00:41:43.730 --> 00:41:48.510
that takes into account all
the stakeholders' interests.

00:41:48.510 --> 00:41:53.050
In particular, with regard to
imbedded software I don't know

00:41:53.050 --> 00:41:56.760
that those issues are any different
and I think that's why it's led

00:41:56.760 --> 00:42:00.720
to a discussion here that has
gone well beyond imbedded software

00:42:00.720 --> 00:42:06.260
and focused primarily on
things like 1201 and ownership

00:42:06.260 --> 00:42:09.770
and copyright ability
and things like that

00:42:09.770 --> 00:42:15.830
because I don't think there's
anything specific with regard

00:42:15.830 --> 00:42:19.620
to the Fair Use doctrine either
pro or con that's specific

00:42:19.620 --> 00:42:26.360
to the imbedded software
in consumer products.

00:42:26.360 --> 00:42:28.150
&gt;&gt; Catherine Rowland: Mr. Harbeson.

00:42:28.150 --> 00:42:30.800
&gt;&gt; Eric Harbeson: So I apologize.

00:42:30.800 --> 00:42:38.240
I'm still trying to figure out why
we're talking about specific uses

00:42:38.240 --> 00:42:44.470
when really as has been said the
Fair Use doctrine is always going

00:42:44.470 --> 00:42:47.510
to end up being applied
by the courts anyway.

00:42:47.510 --> 00:42:51.690
I will say though that a
lot of the conversations

00:42:51.690 --> 00:42:55.490
that we're having are familiar
to me in the library context

00:42:55.490 --> 00:42:59.190
so I think it might be
worth considering ways

00:42:59.190 --> 00:43:02.500
in which this has been
discussed before.

00:43:02.500 --> 00:43:06.600
When you're talking about
potential safe harbors,

00:43:06.600 --> 00:43:11.320
things that are automatically
acceptable you can look

00:43:11.320 --> 00:43:18.320
at Section 108 which give libraries
specific things that we can do.

00:43:18.320 --> 00:43:21.540
It is also hopelessly out-of-date

00:43:21.540 --> 00:43:24.220
and not only is it
hopelessly out-of-date

00:43:24.220 --> 00:43:25.540
but the library community

00:43:25.540 --> 00:43:30.430
for the most part is not
advocating bringing it up-to-date

00:43:30.430 --> 00:43:35.390
because to bring it up-to-date is
to first of all to start getting

00:43:35.390 --> 00:43:40.830
at the problem of risking
creating a ceiling rather

00:43:40.830 --> 00:43:43.800
than a floor even though as
in Georgia state they have

00:43:43.800 --> 00:43:47.030
and in [inaudible] Trust they
specifically said no it's not,

00:43:47.030 --> 00:43:48.680
it is a floor.

00:43:48.680 --> 00:43:54.600
But the problem with
creating these safe harbors is

00:43:54.600 --> 00:43:57.400
in the details of the wording.

00:43:57.400 --> 00:44:00.110
I have not found Congress' ability

00:44:00.110 --> 00:44:09.310
to create succinct legislation
optimism producing so I think

00:44:09.310 --> 00:44:14.980
that one should be careful
with the safe harbor idea also

00:44:14.980 --> 00:44:18.330
in the de minimis doctrine
which was brought up by caution

00:44:18.330 --> 00:44:23.310 position:56%
that if you look at Bridgeport Music
the Court said two notes might be de

00:44:23.310 --> 00:44:29.060 position:56%
minimis but there isn't much of a de
minimis doctrine in sound recordings

00:44:29.060 --> 00:44:34.990
so and then finally I'm
really worried about you know

00:44:34.990 --> 00:44:40.420
since everyone else has had a pass
on 1201 I'll take my pass right now

00:44:40.420 --> 00:44:46.780
and talk about 1201 C which
is another case of precedent

00:44:46.780 --> 00:44:50.550
for what my principle concern is.

00:44:50.550 --> 00:44:55.590
It's another example of where
you can't quite get to Fair Use

00:44:55.590 --> 00:44:59.950
because you have to cross
that fence that is 1201 first.

00:44:59.950 --> 00:45:03.520
Once you're on the other side of
the fence you can claim Fair Use

00:45:03.520 --> 00:45:07.170
but you still have violated
the law by crossing that fence

00:45:07.170 --> 00:45:11.530
into Fair Use territory
so call it 1201.

00:45:11.530 --> 00:45:13.180
Call it licensing.

00:45:13.180 --> 00:45:17.420
It's that fence that is really
going to be the problem here

00:45:17.420 --> 00:45:20.930 position:56%
and I know I've been beating perhaps
a dead horse but I really think

00:45:20.930 --> 00:45:23.210
that that's a really
important horse to get rid of.

00:45:23.210 --> 00:45:24.510
So thank you.

00:45:24.510 --> 00:45:25.810
&gt;&gt; Catherine Rowland.

00:45:25.810 --> 00:45:27.110
Thank you.

00:45:27.110 --> 00:45:28.410
Mr. Band.

00:45:28.410 --> 00:45:29.710
&gt;&gt; Jonathan Band: So I'll
agree here with Mr. Zuck.

00:45:29.710 --> 00:45:34.170
I think that the Section 1201 F,

00:45:34.170 --> 00:45:37.940
in particular the interoperability
exception

00:45:37.940 --> 00:45:44.350
in the DMCA you know articulated
a very strong policy in favor

00:45:44.350 --> 00:45:51.710
of interoperability and you know in
the report ratings that went along

00:45:51.710 --> 00:45:55.000
with it in Sega v Accolade and
the importance of interoperability

00:45:55.000 --> 00:45:57.350
in the software industry and
how it promotes competition,

00:45:57.350 --> 00:46:01.440
all that was in my view very clear.

00:46:01.440 --> 00:46:10.680
I think also in the various
recommendations the register has

00:46:10.680 --> 00:46:15.840
made in the 1201 context, they've
also sometimes used that language

00:46:15.840 --> 00:46:19.640 position:56%
that there was a strong federal
policy in favor of interoperability.

00:46:19.640 --> 00:46:24.100 position:56%
Now to some extent it's hard to find
those references because it's buried

00:46:24.100 --> 00:46:27.980
in a 300 page recommendation.

00:46:27.980 --> 00:46:29.880
&gt;&gt; Sy Damle: Mr. Band we're
just trying to be thorough.

00:46:29.880 --> 00:46:31.180
&gt;&gt; Jonathan Band: Right, no.

00:46:31.180 --> 00:46:34.530
But and I would very
much hope that coming

00:46:34.530 --> 00:46:38.890 position:56%
out of this study is again a
re-articulation but in an easier way

00:46:38.890 --> 00:46:44.180
to find this very strong
clear federal policy in favor

00:46:44.180 --> 00:46:49.950
of interoperability but where it
relates specifically to you know

00:46:49.950 --> 00:46:55.410
to this issue is it does
matter what is the theory

00:46:55.410 --> 00:46:59.410
under which you have this policy?

00:46:59.410 --> 00:47:04.630
Is the theory a Fair Use theory or
is it as John has been referring

00:47:04.630 --> 00:47:07.700
to a merge or method of operation?

00:47:07.700 --> 00:47:13.820
I mean this does get back
to the Google Oracle case.

00:47:13.820 --> 00:47:19.100 position:56%
If you were to say okay, we're
going to, I think the better rule is

00:47:19.100 --> 00:47:23.740
that it is these elements for
interoperability are you know

00:47:23.740 --> 00:47:25.820
under 102 B not protectable.

00:47:25.820 --> 00:47:29.650
That you don't need to get to
Fair Use and I think that's,

00:47:29.650 --> 00:47:32.720
I know I think that certainly
the 9th circuit case law gets

00:47:32.720 --> 00:47:37.400
to that direction but to the extent

00:47:37.400 --> 00:47:40.740
that you know the Copyright Office
is not comfortable saying that

00:47:40.740 --> 00:47:44.530
and it says okay, this is a 10 2 --
it has to be you know you're going

00:47:44.530 --> 00:47:51.840 position:56%
to put it under a 107 theory I think
even there you know to say okay,

00:47:51.840 --> 00:47:55.820
yes on the one hand 107 is
to be applied case by case.

00:47:55.820 --> 00:47:59.260
On the other hand like
the 9th circuit made clear

00:47:59.260 --> 00:48:02.340
in a Sega v. Accolade
that you know Fair Use

00:48:02.340 --> 00:48:05.920
for purposes you know reverse
engineering for purposes

00:48:05.920 --> 00:48:09.140
of finding elements that are not
protected by copyright is Fair Use

00:48:09.140 --> 00:48:12.740
as a matter of law and so that's
something that you can take

00:48:12.740 --> 00:48:16.240
to the bank in other cases the
lawyer can take to the bank

00:48:16.240 --> 00:48:19.920
in other cases as opposed to saying
in every single case you're going

00:48:19.920 --> 00:48:25.480
to have to kind of do this
really complex analysis and start

00:48:25.480 --> 00:48:30.030
from the beginning and so I think
again that again that's somewhere

00:48:30.030 --> 00:48:34.400
where the report that you come
out here can really be helpful

00:48:34.400 --> 00:48:40.890
and not only re-articulating
the strong policy in favor

00:48:40.890 --> 00:48:45.920
of interoperability but
also coming up a basis,

00:48:45.920 --> 00:48:48.960
helpful basis that can
be useful in the future

00:48:48.960 --> 00:48:51.870
to promote interoperability
in this environment.

00:48:51.870 --> 00:48:53.170
&gt;&gt; Catherine Rowland: Thank
you Mr. Band and I think

00:48:53.170 --> 00:48:55.620
with that we're going
to conclude our session

00:48:55.620 --> 00:49:00.050
so I think right now we are
scheduled to show back up at 1:30.

00:49:00.050 --> 00:49:02.490
Maybe we push it to 1:40
that you have one hour

00:49:02.490 --> 00:49:04.710
so we'll push the next
session back ten minutes

00:49:04.710 --> 00:49:08.430
and we'll see you all
back here at 1:40.

00:49:08.430 --> 00:49:12.130
&gt;&gt; This has been a presentation
of the Library of Congress.
