00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:01.480
 Hello Internet users 

00:00:01.480 --> 00:00:03.220
 Are you enjoying the Internet session? 

00:00:03.220 --> 00:00:06.220
 You may see this section with lots of open tabs 

00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:07.779
 Full of interesting things. 

00:00:07.779 --> 00:00:11.779
 The Internet is stunning because of the rules governing how it works 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:14.339
 The most important of which is "network neutrality" 

00:00:14.339 --> 00:00:16.119
 Treat all data equally. 

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:18.320
 But some Internet service providers (operators) want to give up this rule 

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:20.720
 In order to put themselves between you and your data 

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:23.460
 As one of the most mediating mediators in human history 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:25.760
 For their own sake and against our interests. 

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:28.830
 How do? Well, think of the Internet as a bunch of pipes. 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:33.760
 Some of them are pipelines that transcend the oceans and continents and are flooded with enormous rivers of data. 

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:36.160
 You can not access those pipes directly - because they are too expensive 

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:38.160
 You can not deal with it anyway. 

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:41.210
 But you have a small pipe attached to the big pipes 

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:43.390
 You can get data from them or send them through. 

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:45.999
 You are paying telecom companies to get this pipeline. 

00:00:45.999 --> 00:00:49.139
 The rule of network neutrality means that the small tube does not care what goes through it: 

00:00:49.139 --> 00:00:49.799
 Funny cats clips 

00:00:49.799 --> 00:00:50.599
 Forums 

00:00:50.599 --> 00:00:51.119
 Calls 

00:00:51.119 --> 00:00:51.619
 Or games. 

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:54.420
 Whatever you do, you use that tube completely 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.620
 No site receives preference without the other. 

00:00:56.629 --> 00:01:00.629
 Everyone wants a higher speed Internet, but that needs more conduits in the ground 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:02.969
 Which are slowly and expensive to build. 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:06.229
 You may have heard telecom companies talk about having this rule 

00:01:06.229 --> 00:01:09.409
 Preventing them from building "highways" for particular types of data 

00:01:09.409 --> 00:01:13.209
 They want you to think they are expanding your access to the information hotline 

00:01:13.209 --> 00:01:16.160
 But removing the base of grid neutrality also gives them power 

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:19.400
 To put pitfalls in the current roads and impose higher fees for the use of "highway" 

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:21.660
 Which was as fast as you used to be. 

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:24.130
 The power to favor some data over others 

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:27.190
 Is the power to favor a video site over another 

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:32.190
 And select a very small part of the tube for the section you are watching now 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:32.980
 Or trying 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:34.100
 that 

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:35.760
 Whatever the case. 

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:38.960
 We passed this before: we imposed similar limits on other companies. 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:40.200
 For example, take electricity for example 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:44.180
 You pay for a certain amount and when you arrive at your place you can do whatever you want. 

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:47.240
 The electricity company can not decide that instead of building more generators 

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:49.020
 It will weaken your lamps 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:52.080
 Then you provide a monthly subscription for "stronger lights". 

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:53.520
 The same should apply to the Internet. 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:54.460
 Watt electricity is watts of electricity 

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:55.300
 The kilobut is the kilobut 

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:57.150
 And we will always need more and more. 

00:01:57.150 --> 00:01:58.570
 Maintaining the network neutrality base of the Internet 

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:02.440
 It has a much wider impact than just taking a company more of your loans. 

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:03.880
 I do not want to be too dramatic here 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:07.800
 But maintaining data integrity may be one of the most important issues for this generation. 

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:11.720
 Because without this rule, telecom operators can hinder competitors who do not like them. 

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:16.080
 Did you notice that the same company that sells you Internet service also sells a subscription to watch TV, fixed line, connections and mobile messages 

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:18.230
 Things that the Internet completely replaces? 

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:21.790
 Without data parity, the telecom company can narrow the pipeline to its competitors 

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:25.719
 So you have to get out of the market, or pay for an intruder or both. 

00:02:25.719 --> 00:02:29.519
 It's like if a shop in the city promises to take care of highways everywhere 

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:34.360
 As long as the city gave them full power on all roads without retreating. 

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:39.140
 If you agree to that deal, do not be surprised years later when all the roads leading to that store become 

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:41.880
 Fast and free while the roads leading to other places are slow and neglected. 

00:02:41.889 --> 00:02:45.429
 This city is in short the Internet without the neutrality of the network 

00:02:45.429 --> 00:02:50.169
 Which will be loved by telecom operators, but actual Internet users will not like it as much. 

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:53.510
 Making each pipe handle every data the same way allows the owner a good idea 

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:56.710
 Some knowledge in programming will do something today that millions will see tomorrow. 

00:02:56.710 --> 00:03:01.409
 But only because his data is treated equally with everything else in the pipe. 

00:03:01.409 --> 00:03:03.269
 The Internet treats data equally 

00:03:03.269 --> 00:03:05.460
 It is the Internet that will continue to rain with wonders. 

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:08.400
 But the Internet in which the mediator to choose and control what goes through it 

00:03:08.409 --> 00:03:11.489
 Internet is the recession for all and profits for little. 

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:15.080
 That's why some telecom companies will always want to take control 

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:17.440
 So the cost of maintaining the Internet is wonderful 

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:22.700
 Is the constant vigilance of righteous citizens to defend the neutrality of the network. 

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:28.980
