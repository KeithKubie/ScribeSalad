00:00:08.246 --> 00:00:10.586
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Thanks to gaming
and affordable housing,

00:00:10.896 --> 00:00:12.496
Las Vegas is still booming.

00:00:12.566 --> 00:00:16.386
But good news in the
job market is bad news

00:00:16.386 --> 00:00:18.626
for the district's
high-school dropout rate,

00:00:18.796 --> 00:00:20.376
one of the highest in the country.

00:00:20.646 --> 00:00:23.076
&gt;&gt;Carlos: Las Vegas is different
than anywhere I've ever been,

00:00:23.336 --> 00:00:26.636
because think about it, if you drop
out of school here, people have jobs.

00:00:27.006 --> 00:00:29.336
And just think, you
can earn between 40

00:00:29.336 --> 00:00:31.536
to 80 thousand dollars
parking cars here.

00:00:31.536 --> 00:00:32.546
&gt;&gt;Okay, have a good night.

00:00:32.896 --> 00:00:35.626
&gt;&gt;Carlos: So, you know, it's
a very unique situation.

00:00:36.306 --> 00:00:38.596
&gt;&gt;Narrator: To combat the
high-school dropout problem,

00:00:38.856 --> 00:00:41.386
the district has organized
an extensive network

00:00:41.386 --> 00:00:42.996
of community volunteers.

00:00:43.496 --> 00:00:44.176
&gt;&gt;Man: What are they doing?

00:00:44.376 --> 00:00:45.836
&gt;&gt;They're camping.

00:00:46.386 --> 00:00:47.006
&gt;&gt;Man: They're camping.

00:00:47.396 --> 00:00:49.766
&gt;&gt;Carlos: Everybody thinks
that we're just this Disneyland

00:00:49.766 --> 00:00:50.946
that people come to and leave.

00:00:51.226 --> 00:00:54.326
No, we have over one-and-a-half
million people in the Valley here.

00:00:54.506 --> 00:00:56.706
The community really is
involved in the schools.

00:00:57.036 --> 00:01:01.826
The top CEOs come in and read to kids
in our school district, mentor kids,

00:01:02.066 --> 00:01:05.126
and be good role models
so that our kids feel

00:01:05.126 --> 00:01:07.156
that they're valued in our community.

00:01:07.676 --> 00:01:09.486
&gt;&gt;Now, who helps you with
your homework at home?

00:01:10.406 --> 00:01:11.456
&gt;&gt;My calculator.

00:01:11.876 --> 00:01:12.606
&gt;&gt;Your calculator.

00:01:12.606 --> 00:01:13.656
But does Mother help you?

00:01:15.496 --> 00:01:18.506
&gt;&gt;Thomas: The more smart kids we
have, the better our future will be.

00:01:18.766 --> 00:01:21.326
The more kids that are able to
take care of themselves and provide

00:01:21.326 --> 00:01:23.796
for themselves, the
better we're going to be.

00:01:23.926 --> 00:01:27.516
So I said, "Anyone who does not
have a kid in the school, share.

00:01:27.646 --> 00:01:28.596
Just share what you have."

00:01:29.196 --> 00:01:31.666
&gt;&gt;Narrator: While most
dropouts occur in high school,

00:01:31.966 --> 00:01:36.146
the trouble usually begins in middle
school, so the district's Stay

00:01:36.146 --> 00:01:40.646
in School Mentoring Project targets
seventh-graders, like Chaniece.

00:01:41.176 --> 00:01:44.726
&gt;&gt;Chaniece: We just talk about
grades and stuff like that,

00:01:44.726 --> 00:01:49.256
how I'm feeling some days,
and what I've been doing

00:01:49.256 --> 00:01:56.076
over the weekends and
stuff like that.

00:01:56.076 --> 00:01:59.066
&gt;&gt;Woman: So what else are you guys
going to do after the concert?

00:01:59.066 --> 00:02:03.106
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Volunteers like Mary
Mitchell are trained by the district

00:02:03.106 --> 00:02:06.076
and committed to visiting their
mentees at school once a week.

00:02:06.076 --> 00:02:07.046
&gt;&gt;Mary: They may not
even have a problem.

00:02:07.046 --> 00:02:09.726
They just need someone to just
listen to them talk, you know,

00:02:09.726 --> 00:02:11.696
and actually hearing
what they're saying.

00:02:11.696 --> 00:02:13.406
&gt;&gt;Michael: What we tell the mentors
is to do something with the student

00:02:13.406 --> 00:02:17.936
that you both enjoy doing, something
that will facilitate conversation

00:02:18.116 --> 00:02:21.166
so that the mentor would
have the opportunity

00:02:21.166 --> 00:02:22.926
to get a little better understanding

00:02:22.926 --> 00:02:24.666
of what might be going
wrong with that child.

00:02:24.666 --> 00:02:25.516
&gt;&gt;Chaniece: A or B?

00:02:25.626 --> 00:02:26.636
&gt;&gt;Mary: Let's go with A.

00:02:26.686 --> 00:02:27.266
&gt;&gt;Chaniece: Okay.

00:02:27.666 --> 00:02:31.486
&gt;&gt;Mary: I got involved because
I love kids, having children

00:02:31.486 --> 00:02:33.706
of my own, and it's just a joy.

00:02:34.126 --> 00:02:36.456
I do it for the pleasure of it.

00:02:36.456 --> 00:02:40.316
She loves music, and I think
she's going to go far with it,

00:02:40.556 --> 00:02:42.136
but she says she wants
to be an attorney.

00:02:43.226 --> 00:02:46.886
And I think whatever Chaniece sets
her mind to do, I think she'll do it,

00:02:46.886 --> 00:02:49.076
you know, because she's
very determined.

00:02:49.426 --> 00:02:51.916
&gt;&gt;Chaniece: On the instrument,
this is what you call a scroll.

00:02:52.416 --> 00:02:55.976
&gt;&gt;Man: If I asked you, "What is
13 times 5," can you tell me?

00:02:57.236 --> 00:02:59.306
&gt;&gt;Carlos: The good news is the
other day the headline said

00:02:59.306 --> 00:03:02.276
that we've decreased our dropout
rate, and we're really excited

00:03:02.276 --> 00:03:05.776
about the fact that the community
has rallied to say, "You know,

00:03:05.776 --> 00:03:07.896
the most important
thing are our children."

00:03:07.896 --> 00:03:08.866
&gt;&gt;Man: 10 plus one more.

00:03:11.256 --> 00:03:11.856
&gt;&gt;Boy: Is 11.

00:03:12.156 --> 00:03:12.696
&gt;&gt;Man: Exactly.

00:03:12.696 --> 00:03:13.966
So we're going to write 11 down.

00:03:16.246 --> 00:03:18.216
