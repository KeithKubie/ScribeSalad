eight and what that is in essence and I
think I will do a video about it in the

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299

young it's like maybe not so now you you
 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:34.729
young it's like maybe not so now you you
asked that question properly because you

00:02:34.729 --> 00:02:34.739

say well the terrible education system

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:37.500

the wonderful mother homeschooling right
 

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:42.039
the wonderful mother homeschooling right
that's the danger it's like no because

00:02:42.039 --> 00:02:42.049
that's the danger it's like no because
 

00:02:42.049 --> 00:02:44.449
that's the danger it's like no because
it might not be the wonderful mother

00:02:44.449 --> 00:02:44.459
it might not be the wonderful mother
 

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:45.830
it might not be the wonderful mother
homeschooling it might be the

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:45.840
homeschooling it might be the
 

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:48.140
homeschooling it might be the
pathological mother using the pathology

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:48.150
pathological mother using the pathology
 

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:50.449
pathological mother using the pathology
of the education system as a excuse to

00:02:50.449 --> 00:02:50.459
of the education system as a excuse to
 

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:53.000
of the education system as a excuse to
get her talons into her children right

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:53.010
get her talons into her children right
 

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:54.649
get her talons into her children right
because that's certainly equally

00:02:54.649 --> 00:02:54.659
because that's certainly equally
 

00:02:54.659 --> 00:02:56.659
because that's certainly equally
possible or perhaps even more possible

00:02:56.659 --> 00:02:56.669
possible or perhaps even more possible
 

00:02:56.669 --> 00:02:58.369
possible or perhaps even more possible
because at least in the public education

00:02:58.369 --> 00:02:58.379
because at least in the public education
 

00:02:58.379 --> 00:03:01.520
because at least in the public education
system there's some necessity for

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:01.530
system there's some necessity for
 

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:05.210
system there's some necessity for
consensus so that's something that you

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:05.220
consensus so that's something that you
 

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:08.300
consensus so that's something that you
have to be very aware of and work to

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:08.310
have to be very aware of and work to
 

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:10.399
have to be very aware of and work to
prevent right and so I would say if

00:03:10.399 --> 00:03:10.409
prevent right and so I would say if
 

00:03:10.409 --> 00:03:12.649
prevent right and so I would say if
you're going to do that probably best

00:03:12.649 --> 00:03:12.659
you're going to do that probably best
 

00:03:12.659 --> 00:03:15.530
you're going to do that probably best
not to do it on your own and you need

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:15.540
not to do it on your own and you need
 

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:17.300
not to do it on your own and you need
it's like you need a board of advisers

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:17.310
it's like you need a board of advisers
 

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:18.770
it's like you need a board of advisers
or something like that and so maybe it

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:18.780
or something like that and so maybe it
 

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:20.360
or something like that and so maybe it
can't just be you and you have to figure

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:20.370
can't just be you and you have to figure
 

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:23.599
can't just be you and you have to figure
out well what what is the aim and how

00:03:23.599 --> 00:03:23.609
out well what what is the aim and how
 

00:03:23.609 --> 00:03:24.649
out well what what is the aim and how
are you going to manage that and what

00:03:24.649 --> 00:03:24.659
are you going to manage that and what
 

00:03:24.659 --> 00:03:26.689
are you going to manage that and what
makes you think you can do it even if

00:03:26.689 --> 00:03:26.699
makes you think you can do it even if
 

00:03:26.699 --> 00:03:28.849
