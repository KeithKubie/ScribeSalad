[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:06.227 --> 00:00:08.622
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:10.768 --> 00:00:12.060
TY WARD: How're you doing, man?

00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:13.470
KANWER SINGH: Fine, thank you.

00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:14.928
TY WARD: And before
we get started,

00:00:14.928 --> 00:00:18.790
I do have to say, now,
very impressive stuff here,

00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:22.140
but I just want to let
you guys know this guy is

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:24.780
very important, big deal.

00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:27.650
I found this picture.

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:30.020
Now I don't know if you guys
know who's in this photo.

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:33.492
Show of hands, who knows who's
in this photo, besides Humble?

00:00:33.492 --> 00:00:34.700
You, right there, who's that?

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:35.575
AUDIENCE: Nick Jonas.

00:00:35.575 --> 00:00:37.250
TY WARD: That's
Nick Jonas, right?

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:39.410
And the funniest and best
part about this photo

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:41.240
was when I first saw
it, I didn't even

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:44.360
notice Nick and Priyanka Chopra.

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:46.700
So not only is this
guy big enough deal

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:49.790
to be invited to that wedding,
steal a swagged out photo

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:53.720
with the two of them, but he
also literally stole the photo.

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:56.000
That speaks volumes
to his energy.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.500
All right.

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:57.800
KANWER SINGH: That's
actually the official wedding

00:00:57.800 --> 00:00:58.910
photo for us.

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:00.320
That's the one where
everyone was taking a picture

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:01.220
with the bride and groom.

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.690
TY WARD: Is that right?

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:03.260
KANWER SINGH: We were just like
we're going to b-boy stance it.

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:04.302
TY WARD: Dude, I love it.

00:01:04.302 --> 00:01:05.250
With the blue suit?

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:06.203
That's like so swag.

00:01:06.203 --> 00:01:07.620
KANWER SINGH: Mint
chocolate chip,

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:09.530
that's what I called myself.

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:11.000
TY WARD: I love it.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:12.970
All right, so we're
going to real talk today.

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:14.720
I got some cards here
with some questions,

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:16.020
but we can take a seat.

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.512
We're going to get into it,
trying to be in-- candid.

00:01:18.512 --> 00:01:19.970
We're going to talk
about the book.

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:22.012
We're going to talk a
little bit about your life,

00:01:22.012 --> 00:01:25.740
your background, which kind of
leads me to my first question.

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:27.470
So you wrote a book
called "Unlearn."

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:28.220
KANWER SINGH: Yes.

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:30.137
TY WARD: And you're
talking to folks right now

00:01:30.137 --> 00:01:31.670
at Google who've
literally staked

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:33.860
their entire career on
everything that they've

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:35.300
learned.

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:38.277
So tell me what's
"Unlearn" mean?

00:01:38.277 --> 00:01:39.860
What are we supposed
to be unlearning,

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:42.740
and how does that aid
itself in happiness?

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:47.330
KANWER SINGH: I think a lot of
the times, the most important

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:50.090
idea is that we need to
understand to better our lives,

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:51.140
we've already had.

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:52.430
We've always had them.

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:55.910
Oftentimes, we've had them
as kids, and then life comes,

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:58.220
and it piles us up
with a lot of bullshit.

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:02.388
And then all of a sudden, we
think that we're somebody else,

00:02:02.388 --> 00:02:03.930
so we need to be
something different.

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:06.160
And when I was working as
a school schoolteacher--

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:07.952
and this is a story I
tell in the book-- is

00:02:07.952 --> 00:02:09.863
if you tell a child,
hey, put on your boots

00:02:09.863 --> 00:02:12.530
and then put on your snow pants,
the kid puts on his boots first

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:15.280
and then tries to put his
snow pants over the boots.

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:17.270
And you're like, oh, I get it.

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:18.770
They took it exactly literal.

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:20.760
And you realize how
much of an empty vessel

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:22.400
these kids really are.

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:26.000
And we were once these same
empty vessels, and then slowly,

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.880
but surely, all the stuff
that society teaches us,

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:31.810
our parents teach us, family
teaches us, media teaches us,

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:33.470
it crystallizes in who we are.

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:34.970
And then we start
to think that this

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:36.560
was tattooed into
our soul, and this

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:38.150
is who we are the whole time.

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:40.700
And the reality is it's
not, and we can go back

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:42.950
to a better essence
of who we were

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:46.040
by not acquiring more
things, but instead, letting

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:47.295
go of a lot of stuff.

00:02:47.295 --> 00:02:48.920
And that's kind of
where "Unlearn" was.

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:52.230
So when I was in my most
challenging time in life,

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:54.830
I was searching for
that Tumblr quote

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:57.770
or that idea that
was going to save me

00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:58.880
from all of my troubles.

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:02.460
And then I realized I wasn't
going to learn anything new.

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:05.510
I had to let go of
my expectations,

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:10.040
the idealistic view I had
of the world, my mentality

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:12.410
to blame everybody
else except for myself

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:14.747
for my problems and
my circumstances.

00:03:14.747 --> 00:03:16.580
And when I began letting
go of these things,

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:18.320
I started feeling lighter.

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:22.250
And as I felt lighter, I
was able to take a bigger

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:26.008
journey inside myself,
learn who I was,

00:03:26.008 --> 00:03:27.550
because they always
said be yourself,

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:30.090
but you can't be yourself
if you don't know yourself.

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:32.250
So as I got to
know myself better,

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:35.240
I was able to live a more
authentic life, which

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:37.990
often, people refer to as
their best life, right?

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:40.220
So from that
perspective, I think

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:42.560
it's important to kind of
let go more than we gain.

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:44.745
And I mean, society,
consumerism, everything,

00:03:44.745 --> 00:03:46.370
it teaches us you
have to acquire more.

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:48.810
You need more, and more, and
more, and more to be better.

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:50.840
But I think the reality
is, we really need

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:52.310
to be polishing things off.

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:55.130
We need to grab
some big sandpaper

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:57.440
and get rid of all this
rust because a lot of this

00:03:57.440 --> 00:03:58.730
is formed over the years.

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:00.594
And we don't even realize it.

00:04:00.594 --> 00:04:01.970
TY WARD: Totally.

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:03.470
You just talked a
little bit about--

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:04.920
I mean, we're already
off script, by the way.

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:05.240
This is--

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:05.570
KANWER SINGH: Fantastic.

00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:06.945
TY WARD: I'll
leave it over here.

00:04:06.945 --> 00:04:11.268
You just talked a little bit
about kind of knowing yourself.

00:04:11.268 --> 00:04:13.310
And you're also wearing
a shirt that says create,

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:14.690
rather than find yourself.

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:16.399
KANWER SINGH: Yes,
also designed by me.

00:04:16.399 --> 00:04:19.140
TY WARD: I had a feeling that
was definitely not a plug,

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:20.630
KANWER SINGH: Not yet.

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:22.500
We'll plug it later.

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:26.090
TY WARD: So with that in
mind, though, who are you?

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:27.860
I mean, I read it off
the cart, but like

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:30.980
who are you that gave you--

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:33.620
I always like to think
that our lives are

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:36.610
the perfect curriculum for
everything that we'll need.

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:38.453
But who are you, and
where have you been?

00:04:38.453 --> 00:04:39.870
And what have you
learned and seen

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:44.160
that kind of made you feel
like you could write this book,

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:47.150
and it would
resonate with people?

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:48.650
KANWER SINGH: I
don't think who I am

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:51.320
is what is important
to me writing the book.

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:53.912
I think me writing the book
is the important part to me

00:04:53.912 --> 00:04:54.620
writing the book.

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:56.537
You meet a lot of people
who talk about, oh, I

00:04:56.537 --> 00:04:57.980
want to write a book one day.

00:04:57.980 --> 00:04:59.772
And you're like, you
just have to write it.

00:04:59.772 --> 00:05:02.120
There's no qualifications,
or degrees,

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:04.430
or template that
you have to follow.

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:06.330
You just literally have
to put pen to paper,

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:08.230
and just start smashing
on the keyboard,

00:05:08.230 --> 00:05:10.670
and let those ideas come out.

00:05:10.670 --> 00:05:13.610
And I think for
me, what I realized

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:16.730
is the things that
kind of tickle my fancy

00:05:16.730 --> 00:05:19.650
and get me excited are
stimulation and learning.

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:21.500
I'm a lifelong learner.

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:23.890
That doesn't necessarily
mean I was a great student.

00:05:23.890 --> 00:05:26.890
That doesn't necessarily
mean I'm sitting and reading

00:05:26.890 --> 00:05:27.850
books all day.

00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:31.680
Sometimes I'm reading the
headlines, and that's it.

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:33.980
And sometimes it's just
watching YouTube videos.

00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:35.860
But I enjoy learning new things.

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:39.370
I enjoy having my
biases challenged.

00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:41.260
I enjoy being
like, oh, I thought

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:42.960
this was how it was
going to be, or this

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:45.580
is how it's supposed to be,
and then have somebody just

00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:46.840
totally flip me on my head.

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:51.070
And it doesn't attack
my ego or my identity

00:05:51.070 --> 00:05:52.430
if my beliefs are challenged.

00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:54.280
That actually gets me excited.

00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:56.350
It lets me know that
I'm not growing stale.

00:05:56.350 --> 00:05:58.960
It lets me know that
I'm still able to grow.

00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:03.670
Because if you're not growing,
then you're not really alive.

00:06:03.670 --> 00:06:05.650
So for me, is that
that's who I am

00:06:05.650 --> 00:06:08.500
and the excitement of
having the spark in my brain

00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:09.970
and being like, oh my god.

00:06:09.970 --> 00:06:12.558
One day, this is
going to be tangible.

00:06:12.558 --> 00:06:13.600
I want to make it happen.

00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:16.648
As I was saying, that music
video that we just like--

00:06:16.648 --> 00:06:18.190
and that's because
Lily Singh is just

00:06:18.190 --> 00:06:21.310
a monster in the way she
works and productivity.

00:06:21.310 --> 00:06:22.960
We wrote that song.

00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:26.020
We recorded that song
and edited the song.

00:06:26.020 --> 00:06:28.090
And then we shot the
video, edited the video,

00:06:28.090 --> 00:06:30.160
everything in 72 hours.

00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:33.820
And having an idea of hey,
this would be really cool

00:06:33.820 --> 00:06:36.173
if we can be on the
Toronto Raptors court.

00:06:36.173 --> 00:06:37.090
Well, how do we do it?

00:06:37.090 --> 00:06:37.780
I don't know.

00:06:37.780 --> 00:06:38.980
Let's call everybody.

00:06:38.980 --> 00:06:41.068
And it was actually Google
that made it happen.

00:06:41.068 --> 00:06:41.860
TY WARD: All right.

00:06:41.860 --> 00:06:43.250
KANWER SINGH: Yeah, it
wasn't anybody else.

00:06:43.250 --> 00:06:44.980
Google-- they pulled
the right lever,

00:06:44.980 --> 00:06:47.860
and they got us
into the stadium.

00:06:47.860 --> 00:06:51.130
But it's just having these ideas
and realizing that impossible

00:06:51.130 --> 00:06:52.810
literally means nothing.

00:06:52.810 --> 00:06:54.660
And we can make anything happen.

00:06:54.660 --> 00:06:56.600
And that, for me,
is so exciting.

00:06:56.600 --> 00:06:59.560
And the further I go on
this journey, the more pages

00:06:59.560 --> 00:07:02.500
of my book of excuses I have
to keep ripping out and feeling

00:07:02.500 --> 00:07:03.640
like, oh, I can't do that.

00:07:03.640 --> 00:07:05.650
Oh, guys like me aren't
supposed to do that.

00:07:05.650 --> 00:07:07.817
People that look like me
aren't supposed to be here.

00:07:07.817 --> 00:07:10.480
And then just slowly
like, no, you continually

00:07:10.480 --> 00:07:13.720
pave your own path, and
just, magical things happen.

00:07:13.720 --> 00:07:16.750
And normally, it's just
about leaving the house,

00:07:16.750 --> 00:07:20.920
talking to new people, and
using your fear as a compass,

00:07:20.920 --> 00:07:24.160
rather than viewing your
fear as a roadblock.

00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:27.260
TY WARD: That's awesome, and
that makes a lot of total sense

00:07:27.260 --> 00:07:29.998
behind the whole ethos
of create yourself.

00:07:29.998 --> 00:07:30.790
KANWER SINGH: Yeah.

00:07:30.790 --> 00:07:33.250
TY WARD: So I like that you
talked about the music video

00:07:33.250 --> 00:07:36.480
that we were just watching
because you're quite the emcee.

00:07:36.480 --> 00:07:37.480
And I know that that's--

00:07:37.480 --> 00:07:38.370
KANWER SINGH: Yeah, I get busy.

00:07:38.370 --> 00:07:38.900
TY WARD: Yo, yeah.

00:07:38.900 --> 00:07:39.692
Yeah, you get busy.

00:07:39.692 --> 00:07:40.400
You get down.

00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:42.483
KANWER SINGH: I am not
humble about my rap skills.

00:07:42.483 --> 00:07:44.867
TY WARD: I think that's more
like a funny play on words

00:07:44.867 --> 00:07:45.450
with that pun.

00:07:45.450 --> 00:07:45.790
KANWER SINGH: It is.

00:07:45.790 --> 00:07:46.858
Humble is also a verb.

00:07:46.858 --> 00:07:47.650
People forget that.

00:07:47.650 --> 00:07:48.280
TY WARD: Oh.

00:07:48.280 --> 00:07:49.820
Wait, OK, so let's
talk about that.

00:07:49.820 --> 00:07:51.340
How did you get to
the name Humble?

00:07:51.340 --> 00:07:54.080
KANWER SINGH: The name was
purely born out of spite.

00:07:54.080 --> 00:07:54.580
I was--

00:07:54.580 --> 00:07:54.840
TY WARD: I knew it.

00:07:54.840 --> 00:07:55.340
I knew it.

00:07:58.870 --> 00:08:01.600
KANWER SINGH: In Sikh
heritage and Sikh philosophy,

00:08:01.600 --> 00:08:05.350
the number one challenge
to your peace is your ego.

00:08:05.350 --> 00:08:08.680
And so when I was
on hip hop forums

00:08:08.680 --> 00:08:12.820
and just participating on my
favorite outcast chat boards,

00:08:12.820 --> 00:08:15.320
my username was just
the word Humble.

00:08:15.320 --> 00:08:18.280
And then I got involved
in online rap battles,

00:08:18.280 --> 00:08:23.920
and then in a rap battle,
I had a line that said,

00:08:23.920 --> 00:08:27.860
rappers are basic,
emcees are more advanced.

00:08:27.860 --> 00:08:30.280
But I'm even better,
I'm the poet.

00:08:30.280 --> 00:08:32.320
And it was just a cocky
line to kind of say

00:08:32.320 --> 00:08:34.240
that I'm better than
these rappers and emcees.

00:08:34.240 --> 00:08:36.100
I ended up winning this
really big tournament

00:08:36.100 --> 00:08:38.308
where I had to compete with
five, six different guys.

00:08:38.308 --> 00:08:40.985
And to rub it in, I changed
my name to Humble the Poet.

00:08:40.985 --> 00:08:42.210
TY WARD: Oh.

00:08:42.210 --> 00:08:44.323
You mean a time for the actual--

00:08:44.323 --> 00:08:45.865
did you win, and
then you changed it?

00:08:45.865 --> 00:08:47.280
KANWER SINGH: No, I
won, then changed it.

00:08:47.280 --> 00:08:47.530
TY WARD: OK.

00:08:47.530 --> 00:08:48.905
KANWER SINGH: To
rub it in, yeah.

00:08:48.905 --> 00:08:49.880
So everybody knew.

00:08:49.880 --> 00:08:52.783
And years later, I'm
in a friend's basement.

00:08:52.783 --> 00:08:54.700
And we have a microphone
against the mattress.

00:08:54.700 --> 00:08:56.380
And I recorded my
first verse, and it

00:08:56.380 --> 00:08:58.300
was eight guys in the
room because that's

00:08:58.300 --> 00:09:00.717
what you do when you rap, just
fill the room full of guys.

00:09:00.717 --> 00:09:02.842
And they're like, well, do
you have a rap name yet?

00:09:02.842 --> 00:09:05.140
And I was like, I was
thinking Humble the Poet.

00:09:05.140 --> 00:09:07.333
And they were like,
that's a stupid name.

00:09:07.333 --> 00:09:09.250
And then one guy's like,
that name's too long.

00:09:09.250 --> 00:09:10.200
You need a short name.

00:09:10.200 --> 00:09:11.320
You need a one syllable name.

00:09:11.320 --> 00:09:12.020
I'm like, you know what?

00:09:12.020 --> 00:09:12.815
Screw all you guys.

00:09:12.815 --> 00:09:14.440
I'm going to stick
with Humble the Poet

00:09:14.440 --> 00:09:16.190
because you guys don't
think it will work.

00:09:16.190 --> 00:09:17.630
I'm going to make it work.

00:09:17.630 --> 00:09:20.320
And they were right
in some instances.

00:09:20.320 --> 00:09:23.882
This was right before
social media tags and names.

00:09:23.882 --> 00:09:25.840
A shorter name would have
probably been better,

00:09:25.840 --> 00:09:27.610
but now, I'm stuck with it.

00:09:27.610 --> 00:09:28.610
I'm stubborn.

00:09:28.610 --> 00:09:30.335
And it's not going anywhere.

00:09:30.335 --> 00:09:31.210
TY WARD: I like that.

00:09:31.210 --> 00:09:32.470
Have you been stubborn
your whole life?

00:09:32.470 --> 00:09:32.755
KANWER SINGH: Yes.

00:09:32.755 --> 00:09:32.850
TY WARD: Yeah?

00:09:32.850 --> 00:09:33.660
KANWER SINGH: Very.

00:09:33.660 --> 00:09:35.035
TY WARD: So this
is not something

00:09:35.035 --> 00:09:37.000
that just came with your rise.

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:39.595
It's like, you always had
that spirit of, I got this.

00:09:39.595 --> 00:09:41.470
KANWER SINGH: I've been
stubborn and defiant.

00:09:41.470 --> 00:09:45.460
And yeah, just recently,
I connected with a cousin.

00:09:45.460 --> 00:09:47.530
He lives in New Zealand.

00:09:47.530 --> 00:09:50.530
And our schedules
matched up in Germany,

00:09:50.530 --> 00:09:53.950
and I met him for the
first time since like '93.

00:09:53.950 --> 00:09:56.830
And he said to me, my
first memory of you

00:09:56.830 --> 00:09:58.300
was you were like
five years old,

00:09:58.300 --> 00:10:00.670
and you just kept
looking at me saying, no.

00:10:00.670 --> 00:10:02.757
And I wasn't even asking
you to do anything.

00:10:02.757 --> 00:10:04.340
You just kept looking
at me defiantly,

00:10:04.340 --> 00:10:06.923
like if you do ask me to do
something, the answer is no.

00:10:06.923 --> 00:10:09.340
And I kind of realized that
that kind of clicked something

00:10:09.340 --> 00:10:13.810
in the patterns in my life,
where I definitely am not

00:10:13.810 --> 00:10:15.850
a fan of being told what to do.

00:10:15.850 --> 00:10:19.390
I definitely enjoy the idea
of trying to mold things

00:10:19.390 --> 00:10:21.730
my way, versus trying to fit in.

00:10:21.730 --> 00:10:23.800
And there were a
lot of challenging

00:10:23.800 --> 00:10:26.630
years where I definitely didn't
fit in, and it almost broke me.

00:10:26.630 --> 00:10:29.030
And I wanted to just give
up and kind of blend in

00:10:29.030 --> 00:10:30.900
with everybody else.

00:10:30.900 --> 00:10:35.780
But then eventually, you
realize that, as Dr. Seuss says,

00:10:35.780 --> 00:10:37.977
why try to fit in when you
were born to stand out?

00:10:37.977 --> 00:10:39.560
TY WARD: It's funny
that you say that.

00:10:39.560 --> 00:10:42.637
So we have a building
here on campus, Bin 7--

00:10:42.637 --> 00:10:43.720
oh, nope, I made that up--

00:10:43.720 --> 00:10:46.035
Bin 4 that literally has that--

00:10:46.035 --> 00:10:47.160
KANWER SINGH: Oh, for real?

00:10:47.160 --> 00:10:49.550
TY WARD: Printed on the wall,
coincidentally on the way

00:10:49.550 --> 00:10:50.588
to the bathroom.

00:10:50.588 --> 00:10:51.380
KANWER SINGH: Nice.

00:10:51.380 --> 00:10:53.838
TY WARD: I'm not really sure
what the idea behind that was,

00:10:53.838 --> 00:10:55.610
but I just noticed
it for the first time

00:10:55.610 --> 00:10:56.330
yesterday, because
I love that quote.

00:10:56.330 --> 00:10:57.930
KANWER SINGH: That's dope.

00:10:57.930 --> 00:11:01.520
TY WARD: OK, so you
mentioned that you grew up

00:11:01.520 --> 00:11:04.340
with Sikh religious background.

00:11:04.340 --> 00:11:10.460
My curiosity there is so we
have a audacious Humble, young

00:11:10.460 --> 00:11:13.040
Humble, Sikh
religious background.

00:11:13.040 --> 00:11:16.490
How did the two of those
influences meet together?

00:11:16.490 --> 00:11:19.220
And how have they
shaped you, like how

00:11:19.220 --> 00:11:23.030
you lived your life and
ultimately, written this book?

00:11:23.030 --> 00:11:26.030
KANWER SINGH: I mean,
definitely, Sikhi

00:11:26.030 --> 00:11:27.530
can be viewed as a religion.

00:11:27.530 --> 00:11:30.170
I think more importantly,
it's more of a philosophy,

00:11:30.170 --> 00:11:32.030
and it more kind of
falls under the umbrella

00:11:32.030 --> 00:11:34.860
of eastern philosophy, when
you think about Buddhism,

00:11:34.860 --> 00:11:37.940
Hinduism-- just the
idea of cyclical life.

00:11:37.940 --> 00:11:40.280
Out here, a lot of
the philosophies,

00:11:40.280 --> 00:11:42.112
whether it's Christianity,
Judaism, Islam,

00:11:42.112 --> 00:11:44.570
are straight lines, through
the beginning, middle, and end.

00:11:44.570 --> 00:11:46.220
Do all these things,
and then there's

00:11:46.220 --> 00:11:49.440
something, a reward or a
consequence at the end of it.

00:11:49.440 --> 00:11:53.030
Whereas on the eastern side,
everything's in a cycle.

00:11:53.030 --> 00:11:55.610
Birth and death, the seasons,
everything go that way.

00:11:55.610 --> 00:11:57.500
So I think under those
two umbrellas, they

00:11:57.500 --> 00:11:59.630
only kind of look at
the world being shaped

00:11:59.630 --> 00:12:01.970
by those main philosophies.

00:12:01.970 --> 00:12:05.720
My parents force fed Sikhi
as a dogmatic religion

00:12:05.720 --> 00:12:08.450
to me as a kid the
same way parents force

00:12:08.450 --> 00:12:09.950
their kids to play the piano.

00:12:09.950 --> 00:12:13.160
And you hate every moment
of it, but then you grow up,

00:12:13.160 --> 00:12:16.640
and you're like, oh, now
I have a really full tool

00:12:16.640 --> 00:12:18.890
belt of things that are
really going to benefit me.

00:12:18.890 --> 00:12:22.813
And I mean, the idea that
turmeric is so popular now

00:12:22.813 --> 00:12:23.730
and everybody eats it.

00:12:23.730 --> 00:12:26.000
And that was the stuff the
kids would make fun of me

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:28.220
for having stains on my clothes.

00:12:28.220 --> 00:12:29.940
And they'd call it
curry back then.

00:12:29.940 --> 00:12:33.390
And it's kind of like seeing
how things have changed so much.

00:12:33.390 --> 00:12:35.930
So I think what it
ended up being was,

00:12:35.930 --> 00:12:38.660
my mom kind of sold the idea to
me, telling me these stories.

00:12:38.660 --> 00:12:43.130
Because there's a lot of civil
disobedience in Sikh heritage.

00:12:43.130 --> 00:12:46.070
Punjabi Sikh specifically
in India right now only

00:12:46.070 --> 00:12:48.480
represent 2% of the population.

00:12:48.480 --> 00:12:50.227
So I'm a minority there.

00:12:50.227 --> 00:12:51.060
I'm a minority here.

00:12:51.060 --> 00:12:52.680
I'm a minority everywhere I go.

00:12:52.680 --> 00:12:56.030
So ideas of safe spaces
don't exist for me,

00:12:56.030 --> 00:12:57.140
don't exist for my people.

00:12:57.140 --> 00:12:59.150
We've never had them.

00:12:59.150 --> 00:13:00.740
If we do have them,
we'll probably

00:13:00.740 --> 00:13:02.630
feel very uncomfortable
because that's not

00:13:02.630 --> 00:13:04.340
something we're used to.

00:13:04.340 --> 00:13:06.920
Kind of having a history
of thriving in chaos,

00:13:06.920 --> 00:13:11.030
having a history of not being
planted on one piece of land

00:13:11.030 --> 00:13:15.290
has definitely encouraged me to
continue my nomadic lifestyle

00:13:15.290 --> 00:13:16.427
as well.

00:13:16.427 --> 00:13:17.510
The philosophy in itself--

00:13:17.510 --> 00:13:19.410
Sikh means student.

00:13:19.410 --> 00:13:23.330
So to see me already being
a student of life, me

00:13:23.330 --> 00:13:26.030
getting an education, being
an elementary school teacher--

00:13:26.030 --> 00:13:28.820
all school schoolteachers
have signed up

00:13:28.820 --> 00:13:30.810
to be lifelong learners as well.

00:13:30.810 --> 00:13:33.160
And I think it's
that natural need

00:13:33.160 --> 00:13:36.450
to try to learn as
much as you can.

00:13:36.450 --> 00:13:39.480
And again, the way my
parents have taught it to me

00:13:39.480 --> 00:13:42.380
was about being students
of God, worshipping God.

00:13:42.380 --> 00:13:45.830
And the thing is, all the
texts are written in poetry.

00:13:45.830 --> 00:13:47.480
So you can easily
take the word God

00:13:47.480 --> 00:13:49.370
and replace it with the truth.

00:13:49.370 --> 00:13:50.870
So you can be
students of the truth.

00:13:50.870 --> 00:13:53.043
And now, instead of
looking at the will of God,

00:13:53.043 --> 00:13:54.710
you can be looking
at the will of truth.

00:13:54.710 --> 00:13:57.860
And that can be everything from
respecting what gravity is,

00:13:57.860 --> 00:14:00.107
respecting human
nature, understanding

00:14:00.107 --> 00:14:02.190
how the world works and
becoming students of that.

00:14:02.190 --> 00:14:07.040
And with that, it's an endless
journey of learning the truth.

00:14:07.040 --> 00:14:09.620
So what my truth is
today on this level

00:14:09.620 --> 00:14:12.290
won't be my truth in five years.

00:14:12.290 --> 00:14:14.330
So now you become
this lifelong learner,

00:14:14.330 --> 00:14:17.330
understanding universal
truths and personal truths

00:14:17.330 --> 00:14:21.170
and trying to have them come
to terms with each other.

00:14:21.170 --> 00:14:23.510
And that's a never
ending journey for me.

00:14:23.510 --> 00:14:25.272
So for me in the
beginning, there

00:14:25.272 --> 00:14:27.230
was a lot of rejection
for it because there are

00:14:27.230 --> 00:14:29.737
a lot of cultural influences.

00:14:29.737 --> 00:14:31.820
So when I first started
rapping, people were like,

00:14:31.820 --> 00:14:33.380
oh, this guy thinks he's black.

00:14:33.380 --> 00:14:34.250
Why is he rapping?

00:14:34.250 --> 00:14:36.470
And I'm sitting there
like, every hymn I was ever

00:14:36.470 --> 00:14:40.490
taught to memorize rhymed.

00:14:40.490 --> 00:14:45.230
Over half of the gurus that
I was taught to learn from

00:14:45.230 --> 00:14:48.620
ran armies and had
bodies under their belt.

00:14:48.620 --> 00:14:53.510
And I was listening to
gangster rap before NWA.

00:14:53.510 --> 00:14:54.930
My gurus rhymed and killed.

00:14:54.930 --> 00:14:57.050
This was something I
was always exposed to.

00:14:57.050 --> 00:14:59.630
If you go to temples
in Toronto, they

00:14:59.630 --> 00:15:04.100
have pictures, photographs
of dead bodies hanging

00:15:04.100 --> 00:15:07.400
on the walls of young men
who fought for a cause

00:15:07.400 --> 00:15:08.510
and gave up their lives.

00:15:08.510 --> 00:15:10.340
We were exposed to this.

00:15:10.340 --> 00:15:12.830
We were a very martial people.

00:15:12.830 --> 00:15:16.640
We've always been encouraged
to be [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]..

00:15:16.640 --> 00:15:18.830
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]
means always be ready,

00:15:18.830 --> 00:15:21.400
always be prepared.

00:15:21.400 --> 00:15:23.580
Some people believe in
a ceremonial dagger.

00:15:23.580 --> 00:15:25.900
But the reality of that is
we've been fighting wars,

00:15:25.900 --> 00:15:27.525
and we've been doing
that because we've

00:15:27.525 --> 00:15:30.160
been a minority our
entire existence.

00:15:30.160 --> 00:15:32.440
So seeing the connections,
and as I got older,

00:15:32.440 --> 00:15:34.232
being able to own it
myself and being like,

00:15:34.232 --> 00:15:36.065
all right, here are the
elements that really

00:15:36.065 --> 00:15:37.480
connect with me authentically.

00:15:37.480 --> 00:15:41.780
And it is to be not only a
student, but to be a soldier,

00:15:41.780 --> 00:15:44.170
and then learning
that hey, the soldier

00:15:44.170 --> 00:15:47.800
isn't that guy who's just
simply outside on a Saturday

00:15:47.800 --> 00:15:50.448
afternoon, protesting
for Palestine.

00:15:50.448 --> 00:15:52.240
The soldier is the one
fighting the biggest

00:15:52.240 --> 00:15:54.340
battles on the inside.

00:15:54.340 --> 00:15:55.900
And those are the
ones that I really

00:15:55.900 --> 00:16:00.070
had to take a lot of times to
deal with, especially when I

00:16:00.070 --> 00:16:01.690
decided I was going to--

00:16:01.690 --> 00:16:04.570
talking about the issues
that were happening

00:16:04.570 --> 00:16:07.060
in Sri Lanka when the
Tamil Tigers were fighting

00:16:07.060 --> 00:16:10.330
for their freedom, or the
ongoing conflict in Israel

00:16:10.330 --> 00:16:14.148
and Palestine, or any human
rights issue that exists,

00:16:14.148 --> 00:16:15.940
you write about them,
and you explore them.

00:16:15.940 --> 00:16:17.500
But then you take it deeper,
and you're like, wait,

00:16:17.500 --> 00:16:19.580
it's not about these
political issues.

00:16:19.580 --> 00:16:23.470
It's about power, oppression,
greed, human nature,

00:16:23.470 --> 00:16:28.150
and then our best source for
all of that is ourselves.

00:16:28.150 --> 00:16:30.730
And then I started talking
about my oppression

00:16:30.730 --> 00:16:35.620
when I oppress, when I'm
chasing power, when I'm greedy.

00:16:35.620 --> 00:16:39.010
And that really
changed the trajectory

00:16:39.010 --> 00:16:41.650
of my art and my work,
and that brought me

00:16:41.650 --> 00:16:43.510
closer back to Sikh
heritage, which

00:16:43.510 --> 00:16:46.180
was always talking about that.

00:16:46.180 --> 00:16:49.510
If you read any of the
writings in the hymns in Sikh

00:16:49.510 --> 00:16:52.600
scriptures, there's no talk
about growing your beard

00:16:52.600 --> 00:16:54.640
or wearing a turban.

00:16:54.640 --> 00:16:57.040
This is a lot more
heritage and cultural.

00:16:57.040 --> 00:17:00.700
This just talks about your
lust, your greed, your anger,

00:17:00.700 --> 00:17:03.700
your attachment, your ego,
how these things impact

00:17:03.700 --> 00:17:04.900
our happiness.

00:17:04.900 --> 00:17:07.130
And there's no talk
about, this is a sin.

00:17:07.130 --> 00:17:08.470
This is right, this is wrong.

00:17:08.470 --> 00:17:10.630
There's just
writings from people

00:17:10.630 --> 00:17:13.060
who are trying
their best to have

00:17:13.060 --> 00:17:16.010
a healthy relationship with
what they consider the truth.

00:17:16.010 --> 00:17:17.950
And you're sharing
it poetically,

00:17:17.950 --> 00:17:21.400
and I think for our people
being in North India,

00:17:21.400 --> 00:17:24.460
North India has been the
front door for invaders

00:17:24.460 --> 00:17:26.640
since Alexander the Great.

00:17:26.640 --> 00:17:29.740
And for any group of
people to have art,

00:17:29.740 --> 00:17:31.630
you need some stability.

00:17:31.630 --> 00:17:33.730
We didn't have the
stability out there.

00:17:33.730 --> 00:17:36.670
So the moment our families
started coming and crossing

00:17:36.670 --> 00:17:40.210
the pond over North America
in the '60s and the '70s,

00:17:40.210 --> 00:17:42.543
we're that generation who had
that stability to explore.

00:17:42.543 --> 00:17:44.502
So that's why you're
seeing an explosion of it.

00:17:44.502 --> 00:17:45.790
That's why you have Rupi Kaur.

00:17:45.790 --> 00:17:46.840
That's why you have Lily Singh.

00:17:46.840 --> 00:17:47.800
That's why you have [INAUDIBLE].

00:17:47.800 --> 00:17:48.910
That's why you have me.

00:17:48.910 --> 00:17:51.070
You're having this
first crop of artists,

00:17:51.070 --> 00:17:53.920
but now, that's the
beginning of the wave.

00:17:53.920 --> 00:17:56.590
Because when people
ask me, who's

00:17:56.590 --> 00:17:59.350
the artistic person in
your family, I don't know.

00:17:59.350 --> 00:18:01.180
I don't know if it's
my mom or my dad.

00:18:01.180 --> 00:18:03.400
They were never
given the opportunity

00:18:03.400 --> 00:18:05.690
to explore creativity.

00:18:05.690 --> 00:18:07.960
My father has a master's
degree, and he didn't have

00:18:07.960 --> 00:18:09.700
an opportunity to explore that.

00:18:09.700 --> 00:18:11.890
He came to Canada
and drove a cab.

00:18:11.890 --> 00:18:17.195
And so for us, it's trying to
pick up where they left off

00:18:17.195 --> 00:18:19.570
because we never had-- and
even in our history as people,

00:18:19.570 --> 00:18:22.155
we don't have a
lineage of poets.

00:18:22.155 --> 00:18:23.280
We have maybe two or three.

00:18:23.280 --> 00:18:27.300
We don't have a lineage
of artists and painters.

00:18:27.300 --> 00:18:30.220
There's a lot of hiccups in our
history because of invasions

00:18:30.220 --> 00:18:32.587
and most recently,
when the British came.

00:18:32.587 --> 00:18:33.920
And they changed a lot of stuff.

00:18:33.920 --> 00:18:36.520
So for me now, it's about
finding myself, but also trying

00:18:36.520 --> 00:18:38.050
to continue this heritage.

00:18:38.050 --> 00:18:41.480
And the challenges are not so
much people on the outside,

00:18:41.480 --> 00:18:42.730
but also people on the inside.

00:18:42.730 --> 00:18:47.020
Because fundamentalism is people
who find comfort in the past.

00:18:47.020 --> 00:18:48.940
And people are
like, hey, this is

00:18:48.940 --> 00:18:52.190
what a guy with a beard and
turban is supposed to do.

00:18:52.190 --> 00:18:53.590
You're not looking like that.

00:18:53.590 --> 00:18:55.690
You're not acting like that.

00:18:55.690 --> 00:18:57.230
You're making us uncomfortable.

00:18:57.230 --> 00:18:59.170
So I get a lot of
resistance internally

00:18:59.170 --> 00:19:00.400
within the community.

00:19:00.400 --> 00:19:03.310
And instead of having a chip
on my shoulder and being like,

00:19:03.310 --> 00:19:05.470
my people and my
culture don't accept me,

00:19:05.470 --> 00:19:09.070
I have to recognize that hey,
they're speaking their fear.

00:19:09.070 --> 00:19:12.040
Because now I'm in a
position of influence.

00:19:12.040 --> 00:19:15.370
And they want me to
adhere to culture

00:19:15.370 --> 00:19:18.670
because they're afraid
that I can rewrite culture.

00:19:18.670 --> 00:19:20.050
And that's the challenge.

00:19:20.050 --> 00:19:23.980
But it's my job to
continue the story

00:19:23.980 --> 00:19:26.950
and write culture and
understand that hey,

00:19:26.950 --> 00:19:29.530
my parents had this many tools.

00:19:29.530 --> 00:19:31.180
I have the education
and the life

00:19:31.180 --> 00:19:33.010
experiences with
this many tools.

00:19:33.010 --> 00:19:35.290
What can I do to ensure
that the next generation has

00:19:35.290 --> 00:19:36.550
this many tools?

00:19:36.550 --> 00:19:40.000
So, it's been an
interesting journey,

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:43.005
but I think me, and
specifically Lily, just--

00:19:43.005 --> 00:19:44.380
because I stay
with her out here,

00:19:44.380 --> 00:19:46.150
and we spend a lot
of time together--

00:19:46.150 --> 00:19:50.110
we talk about this a lot as
to recognizing our influence.

00:19:50.110 --> 00:19:51.550
People are copying my tattoos.

00:19:51.550 --> 00:19:53.500
People tie their turban
the way I tie it.

00:19:53.500 --> 00:19:56.360
And you're like, OK, well,
there's a responsibility here

00:19:56.360 --> 00:19:56.860
now.

00:19:56.860 --> 00:19:59.950
And then also just with
the newer generation,

00:19:59.950 --> 00:20:01.930
folks don't care.

00:20:01.930 --> 00:20:04.150
They don't label
as much anymore.

00:20:04.150 --> 00:20:07.540
Generation Z, they
don't care what you are.

00:20:07.540 --> 00:20:10.720
And what influence
are we having on them?

00:20:10.720 --> 00:20:12.580
And how can we have
a positive influence?

00:20:12.580 --> 00:20:15.100
So for me, it's like the
overarching theme I'm always

00:20:15.100 --> 00:20:18.580
encouraging and trying to
shove down everybody's throat

00:20:18.580 --> 00:20:21.760
is not look like me, act
like me, dress like me.

00:20:21.760 --> 00:20:25.790
It's chase
self-awareness like me.

00:20:25.790 --> 00:20:27.450
And if you want to
be like me, that

00:20:27.450 --> 00:20:31.480
means being the best version
of you, whatever that is.

00:20:31.480 --> 00:20:35.130
And if that's a purple
mohawk, and a tutu,

00:20:35.130 --> 00:20:38.300
and roller skates
to work, then do it.

00:20:38.300 --> 00:20:40.110
That's what I'm
encouraging everybody

00:20:40.110 --> 00:20:42.300
to kind of do within
their own, and be

00:20:42.300 --> 00:20:43.530
your own student of truth.

00:20:43.530 --> 00:20:46.140
And you don't have
to look a certain way

00:20:46.140 --> 00:20:48.717
to make that happen.

00:20:48.717 --> 00:20:50.300
TY WARD: Couldn't
have said it better.

00:20:50.300 --> 00:20:53.130
That's [INAUDIBLE] why
you wrote the book.

00:20:53.130 --> 00:20:55.770
My next question is going
to be about happiness.

00:20:55.770 --> 00:20:57.750
Because I think happiness--

00:20:57.750 --> 00:21:02.610
a lot of times, we think
about happiness as a feeling.

00:21:02.610 --> 00:21:06.430
But you talk a lot about
happiness being a mindset.

00:21:06.430 --> 00:21:08.760
And I really want to get
into what that means.

00:21:08.760 --> 00:21:11.400
More specifically, how
do you define that?

00:21:11.400 --> 00:21:12.600
How is happiness a mindset?

00:21:12.600 --> 00:21:15.270
And then, what have you
done, and what can others

00:21:15.270 --> 00:21:19.210
do to sort of cultivate
this mindset of happiness?

00:21:19.210 --> 00:21:20.760
KANWER SINGH: One
step before that,

00:21:20.760 --> 00:21:24.330
I do not believe it's
important or even possible

00:21:24.330 --> 00:21:26.050
to be happy all the time.

00:21:26.050 --> 00:21:28.710
I actually think that would
be detrimental to our lives.

00:21:28.710 --> 00:21:31.047
We rarely learn anything
when we're happy.

00:21:31.047 --> 00:21:32.130
TY WARD: That's very true.

00:21:32.130 --> 00:21:33.960
KANWER SINGH: Because
Bill Gates said

00:21:33.960 --> 00:21:35.190
success is a lousy teacher.

00:21:35.190 --> 00:21:39.520
We learn when the
shit hits the fan.

00:21:39.520 --> 00:21:42.390
And unhappiness is simply
when the picture in our head

00:21:42.390 --> 00:21:44.640
doesn't match the
picture in front of us.

00:21:44.640 --> 00:21:48.210
And now, I may not be able to
control the picture in front

00:21:48.210 --> 00:21:50.460
of me, but I have
much more control

00:21:50.460 --> 00:21:51.870
in the picture in my head.

00:21:51.870 --> 00:21:54.720
So managing my expectations
and having that power

00:21:54.720 --> 00:21:59.520
allows me to decide how
happy I am a lot more often.

00:21:59.520 --> 00:22:02.010
In no way, shape,
or form am I saying

00:22:02.010 --> 00:22:05.640
people who have dealt with
severe trauma can just,

00:22:05.640 --> 00:22:06.540
now I'm happy.

00:22:06.540 --> 00:22:08.430
I'm not encouraging that at all.

00:22:08.430 --> 00:22:13.500
But I am encouraging taking
a lot more responsibility.

00:22:13.500 --> 00:22:15.310
Because when we
take responsibility,

00:22:15.310 --> 00:22:17.800
it's not necessarily
taking the blame.

00:22:17.800 --> 00:22:18.990
It's empowering ourselves.

00:22:18.990 --> 00:22:21.040
If I blame you for
all my circumstances,

00:22:21.040 --> 00:22:23.760
then you have all the
power in my circumstances.

00:22:23.760 --> 00:22:25.500
If I take some
personal responsibility

00:22:25.500 --> 00:22:29.760
for my circumstances, even
the 1% of whatever it is,

00:22:29.760 --> 00:22:31.895
now I have 1% more power.

00:22:31.895 --> 00:22:33.270
So for me, happiness
is a mindset

00:22:33.270 --> 00:22:37.710
because the recipe for
happiness is very simple.

00:22:37.710 --> 00:22:39.660
It's gratitude,
it's appreciation.

00:22:39.660 --> 00:22:41.850
If I bought you a
Lamborghini, you're

00:22:41.850 --> 00:22:45.870
happy because you
appreciate Lamborghinis.

00:22:45.870 --> 00:22:48.450
Maybe if I bought you a puppy,
you wouldn't appreciate it

00:22:48.450 --> 00:22:50.280
because you're like, this guy
just gave me a bunch of work.

00:22:50.280 --> 00:22:52.350
TY WARD: What about a
puppy and a Lamborghini?

00:22:52.350 --> 00:22:53.790
KANWER SINGH: A puppy that
can drive a Lamborghini.

00:22:53.790 --> 00:22:55.440
TY WARD: Oh, you just
took it to the next level.

00:22:55.440 --> 00:22:56.935
KANWER SINGH: Yeah,
a puppy chauffeur.

00:22:56.935 --> 00:22:57.435
TY WARD: Oh!

00:22:57.435 --> 00:22:58.530
That would be amazing.

00:22:58.530 --> 00:23:01.195
What would you call him?

00:23:01.195 --> 00:23:02.070
KANWER SINGH: Speedy?

00:23:02.070 --> 00:23:02.460
TY WARD: Speedy?

00:23:02.460 --> 00:23:02.860
OK.

00:23:02.860 --> 00:23:03.190
I like that.

00:23:03.190 --> 00:23:03.690
I like that.

00:23:03.690 --> 00:23:04.680
I'd call him Ronald.

00:23:04.680 --> 00:23:05.250
KANWER SINGH: Ronald?

00:23:05.250 --> 00:23:05.820
TY WARD: Yeah.

00:23:05.820 --> 00:23:06.580
KANWER SINGH: That works, too.

00:23:06.580 --> 00:23:07.005
TY WARD: Yeah, yeah.

00:23:07.005 --> 00:23:07.880
I didn't mean to cut you off.

00:23:07.880 --> 00:23:08.580
KANWER SINGH: No, not at all.

00:23:08.580 --> 00:23:10.120
TY WARD: I love side tangents
because I feel like that's--

00:23:10.120 --> 00:23:11.578
KANWER SINGH: Ronald
the puppy that

00:23:11.578 --> 00:23:14.140
drives the Lambo that always
finds parking, the best spots.

00:23:14.140 --> 00:23:15.510
TY WARD: Always finds parking.

00:23:15.510 --> 00:23:18.052
And if he doesn't, he just loops
the block a couple of times.

00:23:18.052 --> 00:23:20.940
KANWER SINGH: Yeah, and he
just says, yo, let me just

00:23:20.940 --> 00:23:22.108
drop you off at the front.

00:23:22.108 --> 00:23:23.900
You handle yours, I'll
worry about parking.

00:23:23.900 --> 00:23:25.110
TY WARD: And you're like, dude.

00:23:25.110 --> 00:23:25.890
Yeah, I love that.

00:23:25.890 --> 00:23:28.353
KANWER SINGH: He would be
the most popular guy in LA.

00:23:28.353 --> 00:23:29.520
TY WARD: He seriously would.

00:23:29.520 --> 00:23:31.645
We should actually start
a little Instagram for him

00:23:31.645 --> 00:23:33.450
already because I feel like--

00:23:33.450 --> 00:23:34.520
KANWER SINGH: He would
probably be too cool for this.

00:23:34.520 --> 00:23:35.860
He would probably
be at Coachella.

00:23:35.860 --> 00:23:36.780
TY WARD: Oh, he would be.

00:23:36.780 --> 00:23:37.920
He'd be on his
way out to Coach--

00:23:37.920 --> 00:23:39.045
actually, no, you're right.

00:23:39.045 --> 00:23:40.953
If he was on his way,
he's already there.

00:23:40.953 --> 00:23:42.120
He's probably already there.

00:23:42.120 --> 00:23:42.500
KANWER SINGH: He's
already there, yeah.

00:23:42.500 --> 00:23:44.122
TY WARD: So speak--

00:23:44.122 --> 00:23:45.330
I like the way this is going.

00:23:45.330 --> 00:23:46.710
Because there's a lot of--

00:23:46.710 --> 00:23:47.793
what you guys don't know--

00:23:47.793 --> 00:23:49.830
I mean, you probably
can tell none of this

00:23:49.830 --> 00:23:50.850
is what was planned.

00:23:50.850 --> 00:23:53.428
But we're kind of just
freestyling right now.

00:23:53.428 --> 00:23:54.720
And I want to talk a lot more--

00:23:54.720 --> 00:23:55.860
KANWER SINGH: You're going
to hear from my publicist.

00:23:55.860 --> 00:23:57.440
TY WARD: Oh, I know,
I know, I know.

00:23:57.440 --> 00:23:59.940
KANWER SINGH: She's like, we
made all these very interesting

00:23:59.940 --> 00:24:02.083
boring questions, and you
didn't ask any of them.

00:24:02.083 --> 00:24:03.000
TY WARD: Well, we did.

00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:04.372
We've interwoven some of them.

00:24:04.372 --> 00:24:05.080
KANWER SINGH: OK.

00:24:05.080 --> 00:24:05.360
OK.

00:24:05.360 --> 00:24:06.985
TY WARD: We've
interwoven some of them.

00:24:06.985 --> 00:24:08.940
But I want to talk
about hip hop right now.

00:24:08.940 --> 00:24:10.660
One of my favorite topics--

00:24:10.660 --> 00:24:12.810
I know it's probably one
of your favorite topics.

00:24:12.810 --> 00:24:16.890
And I think that hip hop has had
a pretty big influence on you

00:24:16.890 --> 00:24:18.130
and your writing style.

00:24:18.130 --> 00:24:22.620
And I really want to talk about
your hip hop past and present

00:24:22.620 --> 00:24:26.430
and how it has influenced the
way that you wrote this book.

00:24:26.430 --> 00:24:27.888
Because for you
that don't know yet

00:24:27.888 --> 00:24:30.263
and who don't have a copy of
the book yet, which I'm sure

00:24:30.263 --> 00:24:32.730
you all will preorder-- you
can preorder it on Amazon.

00:24:32.730 --> 00:24:33.740
KANWER SINGH: So
it's actually-- oh,

00:24:33.740 --> 00:24:35.810
I think my publicist
gave you the wrong note.

00:24:35.810 --> 00:24:37.240
It came out April 9.

00:24:37.240 --> 00:24:38.490
TY WARD: It came out April 9--

00:24:38.490 --> 00:24:38.695
KANWER SINGH: So we're out.

00:24:38.695 --> 00:24:40.320
TY WARD: So it's
already out on Amazon.

00:24:40.320 --> 00:24:43.110
There are some free copies
for those of you brave enough

00:24:43.110 --> 00:24:45.752
to adventure into the front row.

00:24:45.752 --> 00:24:47.460
KANWER SINGH: Oh,
yeah, there's literally

00:24:47.460 --> 00:24:48.630
free copies on the chairs.

00:24:48.630 --> 00:24:49.980
TY WARD: Yeah.

00:24:49.980 --> 00:24:50.055
KANWER SINGH: Clever.

00:24:50.055 --> 00:24:51.805
TY WARD: For those of
you that don't know,

00:24:51.805 --> 00:24:53.550
the book is written in a very--

00:24:53.550 --> 00:24:58.170
I would say unique way, where
it's using lots of quotes

00:24:58.170 --> 00:25:00.465
and then expounding
upon said quotes.

00:25:00.465 --> 00:25:03.430
So I want to understand hip hop.

00:25:03.430 --> 00:25:06.217
How has it influenced you
in how you wrote this book?

00:25:06.217 --> 00:25:08.050
KANWER SINGH: So I've
got two older sisters.

00:25:08.050 --> 00:25:10.300
So when I grew up, whatever
music I listened to

00:25:10.300 --> 00:25:11.730
was whatever they listened to.

00:25:11.730 --> 00:25:15.630
So I'm listening to New Kids on
the Block and George Michael.

00:25:15.630 --> 00:25:18.395
And Vanilla Ice was
probably the first raps--

00:25:18.395 --> 00:25:20.020
"Ice Ice Baby" was
one of the first rap

00:25:20.020 --> 00:25:23.340
songs I had memorized because
these are the top 40 pop

00:25:23.340 --> 00:25:25.590
tracks that my sisters,
when they were young girls,

00:25:25.590 --> 00:25:28.400
they were listening to.

00:25:28.400 --> 00:25:30.290
The thing with hip
hop specifically--

00:25:30.290 --> 00:25:32.450
and it might be for
other genres of music,

00:25:32.450 --> 00:25:34.325
I just personally never
had that experience--

00:25:34.325 --> 00:25:37.150
is there's always going
to be that one song that

00:25:37.150 --> 00:25:44.290
hits you with such tenacious
reality that it just hits you.

00:25:44.290 --> 00:25:47.180
And you have an
involuntary reaction to it.

00:25:47.180 --> 00:25:52.610
And for me, it was actually
in high school with Outkast.

00:25:52.610 --> 00:25:56.030
André 3000-- "I came into
this world high as a bird from

00:25:56.030 --> 00:25:57.470
second hand cocaine powder.

00:25:57.470 --> 00:25:59.220
I know it sounds absurd."

00:25:59.220 --> 00:26:03.370
And just hearing those lines
and then seeing this cool rapper

00:26:03.370 --> 00:26:08.660
wearing a turban in his music
videos with five half-naked

00:26:08.660 --> 00:26:13.400
ladies making everything look
like this super futuristic--

00:26:13.400 --> 00:26:17.553
both futuristic and nostalgic
African royalty vibe.

00:26:17.553 --> 00:26:19.970
And you're just like, I've
never seen this imagery before.

00:26:19.970 --> 00:26:21.740
And it just hits you to this
level where you're just like,

00:26:21.740 --> 00:26:22.860
I want more.

00:26:22.860 --> 00:26:24.410
And you just go
into this deep dive.

00:26:24.410 --> 00:26:26.900
And for me, I think it
was, I got really exposed

00:26:26.900 --> 00:26:31.980
to a lot more of the
heavier, deeper hip hop.

00:26:31.980 --> 00:26:34.820
So I'm talking about like,
Lauryn Hill, Outkast,

00:26:34.820 --> 00:26:40.580
Goodie Mob, Common,
Wyclef's First Project,

00:26:40.580 --> 00:26:43.110
all the Ruckus Movement-- so
Black Star, Mos Def, Talib

00:26:43.110 --> 00:26:43.610
Kweli.

00:26:43.610 --> 00:26:47.120
All of this stuff really
resonated with me.

00:26:47.120 --> 00:26:50.270
It felt like modern
day Bob Marley.

00:26:50.270 --> 00:26:53.330
It felt like this universal
stuff that hit me.

00:26:53.330 --> 00:26:57.320
And I already enjoy
putting words together.

00:26:57.320 --> 00:27:00.500
I've been writing short stories
and poems and everything

00:27:00.500 --> 00:27:03.805
since I was seven, eight years
old and loved sharing it.

00:27:03.805 --> 00:27:05.930
And to see these guys do
it on such an elite level,

00:27:05.930 --> 00:27:07.023
it really impacted me.

00:27:07.023 --> 00:27:08.690
And it was probably
the first foundation

00:27:08.690 --> 00:27:12.320
of my authentic self-confidence.

00:27:12.320 --> 00:27:13.820
It was connecting
with these people,

00:27:13.820 --> 00:27:15.653
and they were telling
stories that mattered.

00:27:15.653 --> 00:27:18.500
And hearing rappers-- when
you're in high school,

00:27:18.500 --> 00:27:20.870
and you look like
Master Splinter

00:27:20.870 --> 00:27:23.030
because you have like
three strands of a beard.

00:27:23.030 --> 00:27:25.100
And all your friends
are starting to date,

00:27:25.100 --> 00:27:29.600
but you don't have the
confidence to ask any girl out,

00:27:29.600 --> 00:27:31.490
and plus, you don't
feel attractive.

00:27:31.490 --> 00:27:34.008
And even the men that have
these beautiful turbans

00:27:34.008 --> 00:27:36.050
and full beards, you don't
look like them either.

00:27:36.050 --> 00:27:37.530
You're in your
transition period.

00:27:37.530 --> 00:27:41.212
You're going from
your duckling to swan.

00:27:41.212 --> 00:27:42.920
And but at the same
time, it impacts you.

00:27:42.920 --> 00:27:44.870
And a lot of young guys,
they cut their hair.

00:27:44.870 --> 00:27:45.703
They want to fit in.

00:27:45.703 --> 00:27:46.700
They want to blend in.

00:27:46.700 --> 00:27:49.220
And I think for
me, hip hop helped

00:27:49.220 --> 00:27:51.800
me see the value in who I was.

00:27:51.800 --> 00:27:53.480
And hearing rappers say--

00:27:53.480 --> 00:27:56.360
like Pusha T, the
power's in my hair.

00:27:56.360 --> 00:28:00.110
And just hearing certain
things, it emboldened me a lot.

00:28:00.110 --> 00:28:02.930
And I realized it was
not only-- it saved

00:28:02.930 --> 00:28:04.220
my life in so many occasions.

00:28:04.220 --> 00:28:09.930
And then as I got older, I
felt I needed to contribute.

00:28:09.930 --> 00:28:13.070
I owed it to hip hop
to contribute and write

00:28:13.070 --> 00:28:16.043
that next song for that
next kid in high school.

00:28:16.043 --> 00:28:17.960
Whatever they're dealing
with, whether they're

00:28:17.960 --> 00:28:19.550
dealing with their
weight, whether they're

00:28:19.550 --> 00:28:20.690
dealing with the
fact that they don't

00:28:20.690 --> 00:28:22.982
have two parents, whether
they're dealing with the fact

00:28:22.982 --> 00:28:26.498
that they're in
love with somebody

00:28:26.498 --> 00:28:28.790
that they're not allowed to
be in love with-- anything.

00:28:28.790 --> 00:28:30.980
I wanted to tell their
stories because I realized

00:28:30.980 --> 00:28:32.720
that's what hip hop did for me.

00:28:32.720 --> 00:28:35.390
It told my story when I
couldn't tell it myself,

00:28:35.390 --> 00:28:38.120
but it gave me the
strength to write my story.

00:28:38.120 --> 00:28:40.910
And as human beings, that's
all we've been doing.

00:28:40.910 --> 00:28:44.760
We've been carving stuff on
caves for the next generation.

00:28:44.760 --> 00:28:47.240
And we've been telling stories
and passing stories down.

00:28:47.240 --> 00:28:50.600
And not only that,
record our history

00:28:50.600 --> 00:28:53.430
that also helps us
pave for our future.

00:28:53.430 --> 00:28:56.270
And for me, that's why hip
hop, to me, is so important.

00:28:56.270 --> 00:28:58.740
And also, from a
literary art perspective,

00:28:58.740 --> 00:29:03.270
it's the most
challenging, technical--

00:29:03.270 --> 00:29:05.850
it's the best form
of literary art.

00:29:05.850 --> 00:29:09.380
Jay-Z is significantly
much more talented

00:29:09.380 --> 00:29:12.680
than Shakespeare in my opinion.

00:29:12.680 --> 00:29:17.240
And you take a popular rock
song, and you print it out.

00:29:17.240 --> 00:29:18.920
It's like this many words.

00:29:18.920 --> 00:29:22.080
You take any rapper's
verse, it's this much.

00:29:22.080 --> 00:29:24.590
And when you think of your
Jay-Z's and your Lil Wayne's,

00:29:24.590 --> 00:29:26.660
these guys don't even
put pen to paper.

00:29:26.660 --> 00:29:28.510
They're building all
of this in their heads,

00:29:28.510 --> 00:29:30.260
and then going straight
to the microphone.

00:29:30.260 --> 00:29:33.210
And they didn't do it
for the novelty of it.

00:29:33.210 --> 00:29:35.985
They did it out of necessity in
their life because some of them

00:29:35.985 --> 00:29:37.860
didn't have the tools
to write anything down.

00:29:37.860 --> 00:29:39.920
And so for me,
it's the evolution

00:29:39.920 --> 00:29:43.037
of literary art
to a point that I

00:29:43.037 --> 00:29:44.870
don't think many people
are appreciating it.

00:29:44.870 --> 00:29:46.580
And that's why I do
appreciate having

00:29:46.580 --> 00:29:49.190
Humble the Poet as my name
to try to elevate the art

00:29:49.190 --> 00:29:50.387
form in itself.

00:29:50.387 --> 00:29:51.470
TY WARD: Totally, totally.

00:29:51.470 --> 00:29:54.380
So I mean, with
your blessing, I'd

00:29:54.380 --> 00:29:56.000
love to actually just like--

00:29:56.000 --> 00:29:58.090
this book, by the way--

00:29:58.090 --> 00:30:00.440
I am a slow reader.

00:30:00.440 --> 00:30:01.620
And I mean that.

00:30:01.620 --> 00:30:03.460
If I had to read
it front to back--

00:30:03.460 --> 00:30:05.960
this is real talk here-- it'd
probably take me about a month

00:30:05.960 --> 00:30:06.990
to get through it.

00:30:06.990 --> 00:30:08.390
I'm being vulnerable right now.

00:30:08.390 --> 00:30:11.780
But this book is really
cool because it's

00:30:11.780 --> 00:30:16.050
almost like a magic 8 ball
on steroids that also just

00:30:16.050 --> 00:30:17.620
knows you personally.

00:30:17.620 --> 00:30:23.140
You flip it open to any
spot and find a gem.

00:30:23.140 --> 00:30:25.560
KANWER SINGH: I'm
not a reader either.

00:30:25.560 --> 00:30:28.260
I mean, I have a full bookshelf
now, because every time you

00:30:28.260 --> 00:30:29.850
have a meeting with a
publisher, they send you home

00:30:29.850 --> 00:30:32.340
with a bag of books, or they'll
mail you a box of books.

00:30:32.340 --> 00:30:34.840
So I got all the cool books.

00:30:34.840 --> 00:30:36.690
But this book was--

00:30:36.690 --> 00:30:38.670
I taught the third grade.

00:30:38.670 --> 00:30:41.018
So I thought to myself,
what would an eight--

00:30:41.018 --> 00:30:42.810
if you can explain it
to an eight-year-old,

00:30:42.810 --> 00:30:45.000
you can explain it to anybody.

00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:47.140
And so I made a book
for people who say

00:30:47.140 --> 00:30:48.390
they don't like reading books.

00:30:48.390 --> 00:30:52.470
Because the teacher in me
knows everybody loves reading.

00:30:52.470 --> 00:30:54.660
They just haven't
found that right book.

00:30:54.660 --> 00:30:57.452
And the big thing I used to
tell my students' parents

00:30:57.452 --> 00:30:59.910
were like, hey, if they want
to read the back of the cereal

00:30:59.910 --> 00:31:01.150
box, let them.

00:31:01.150 --> 00:31:04.350
Our goal is to get them to
love reading, not love reading

00:31:04.350 --> 00:31:05.550
something specific.

00:31:05.550 --> 00:31:07.050
We'll find the
academic stuff later.

00:31:07.050 --> 00:31:09.175
Right now, we just need
them to find that one book.

00:31:09.175 --> 00:31:10.860
Because once they
find that one book,

00:31:10.860 --> 00:31:12.630
they'll be hooked on reading.

00:31:12.630 --> 00:31:14.760
And for me, my goal
was to make that book

00:31:14.760 --> 00:31:17.190
for people who don't read.

00:31:17.190 --> 00:31:19.560
And it's been a
challenge, especially

00:31:19.560 --> 00:31:21.390
working with
publishers because they

00:31:21.390 --> 00:31:22.862
want to hit that target market.

00:31:22.862 --> 00:31:25.320
And I was like, I want to hit
that market that doesn't know

00:31:25.320 --> 00:31:27.900
they need this book,
not just the market who

00:31:27.900 --> 00:31:31.540
has read every other book that
might be in the same vein.

00:31:31.540 --> 00:31:32.830
TY WARD: That's totally--

00:31:32.830 --> 00:31:35.080
KANWER SINGH: But you can
definitely open this book up

00:31:35.080 --> 00:31:38.880
to any page, and we'll
do it live right now.

00:31:38.880 --> 00:31:41.720
And I feel like you'll find
something you connect with.

00:31:41.720 --> 00:31:43.887
TY WARD: All right, so I
want the audience right now

00:31:43.887 --> 00:31:45.240
to give me-- don't say anything.

00:31:45.240 --> 00:31:46.800
KANWER SINGH: You guys can try
yourself if you have a book.

00:31:46.800 --> 00:31:48.175
And there's some
in the front row

00:31:48.175 --> 00:31:49.983
if anybody's bold
enough to move up.

00:31:49.983 --> 00:31:51.400
TY WARD: Pop one
open if you want.

00:31:51.400 --> 00:31:54.978
And right now, just hold
an intention, right?

00:31:54.978 --> 00:31:56.270
What are you feeling right now?

00:31:56.270 --> 00:31:57.780
KANWER SINGH: Are you guys
going to make it mystical?

00:31:57.780 --> 00:31:58.800
TY WARD: Oh, we're going
to make it mystical.

00:31:58.800 --> 00:31:59.400
Are you kidding me?

00:31:59.400 --> 00:32:00.430
I can't be sitting up here
with Humble the Poet--

00:32:00.430 --> 00:32:01.280
KANWER SINGH: They
already think I'm

00:32:01.280 --> 00:32:02.697
mystical because
I've got a beard,

00:32:02.697 --> 00:32:04.860
and now you're going
to make it even worse.

00:32:04.860 --> 00:32:06.400
TY WARD: Let's
complete the facade.

00:32:06.400 --> 00:32:06.780
I love it.

00:32:06.780 --> 00:32:08.070
KANWER SINGH: All right,
let's complete the facade.

00:32:08.070 --> 00:32:09.240
TY WARD: It's about
making a vibe.

00:32:09.240 --> 00:32:11.110
KANWER SINGH: You're all going
to turn into the modern day

00:32:11.110 --> 00:32:11.780
Osho.

00:32:11.780 --> 00:32:12.810
TY WARD: All right.

00:32:12.810 --> 00:32:15.150
If the shoe fits, you know?

00:32:15.150 --> 00:32:16.110
All right.

00:32:16.110 --> 00:32:16.630
Here we go.

00:32:19.794 --> 00:32:22.710
"The strongest don't survive.

00:32:22.710 --> 00:32:24.657
The most adaptable do."

00:32:24.657 --> 00:32:25.490
KANWER SINGH: Facts.

00:32:25.490 --> 00:32:26.115
TY WARD: Facts.

00:32:26.115 --> 00:32:27.070
Let's talk about that.

00:32:27.070 --> 00:32:28.625
What does that mean?

00:32:28.625 --> 00:32:30.750
KANWER SINGH: I think it's
just a challenge on some

00:32:30.750 --> 00:32:32.042
of the cliched things you hear.

00:32:32.042 --> 00:32:34.500
It's like only the
strongest survive.

00:32:34.500 --> 00:32:37.050
Me leaving the
safety and security

00:32:37.050 --> 00:32:40.020
of being an elementary school
teacher, a government job that

00:32:40.020 --> 00:32:44.120
happened in Canada, where all
my colleagues were my friends,

00:32:44.120 --> 00:32:45.870
and the priority were
the kids, and nobody

00:32:45.870 --> 00:32:47.507
was in competition with me.

00:32:47.507 --> 00:32:49.590
Everybody was getting paid
whatever they got paid,

00:32:49.590 --> 00:32:52.320
and your pay grade
went by raises.

00:32:52.320 --> 00:32:55.360
And then I left that to go into
the world of entertainment,

00:32:55.360 --> 00:32:58.670
which is the jungle
in comparison.

00:32:58.670 --> 00:33:01.830
And the first people
that recognized my talent

00:33:01.830 --> 00:33:03.370
weren't looking to help me.

00:33:03.370 --> 00:33:08.160
They were looking to rip me
to shreds or profit off of me.

00:33:08.160 --> 00:33:09.870
And what I realized
was it wasn't

00:33:09.870 --> 00:33:13.080
my strength that was going
to help me move forward.

00:33:13.080 --> 00:33:17.680
It was going to be my ability to
adapt, learn, and move forward.

00:33:17.680 --> 00:33:20.460
And especially as a
stubborn individual,

00:33:20.460 --> 00:33:23.470
that was a big lesson I had
to tell myself that is, hey,

00:33:23.470 --> 00:33:25.350
you have to adjust yourselves.

00:33:25.350 --> 00:33:27.030
You can't control the wind.

00:33:27.030 --> 00:33:28.740
You have to adjust yourselves.

00:33:28.740 --> 00:33:31.290
And for me, that's kind of
where this idea came from.

00:33:31.290 --> 00:33:34.640
And I mean, I'm sure
Darwin would agree.

00:33:34.640 --> 00:33:37.710
It's the adaptable
ones that kick it.

00:33:37.710 --> 00:33:40.740
And I think very
often, translating that

00:33:40.740 --> 00:33:43.470
into our modern
society, it would

00:33:43.470 --> 00:33:45.630
be it's not the most
talented people that

00:33:45.630 --> 00:33:46.950
are going to succeed.

00:33:46.950 --> 00:33:49.050
It's the people with
the grit, the people

00:33:49.050 --> 00:33:50.970
with the perseverance,
and the people

00:33:50.970 --> 00:33:55.740
who are willing not to adjust
their goals, but people who

00:33:55.740 --> 00:33:57.870
are willing to address
their strategies

00:33:57.870 --> 00:34:00.960
and their routes to get there.

00:34:00.960 --> 00:34:02.520
TY WARD: Well said, well said.

00:34:02.520 --> 00:34:04.830
Now, I want to be
respectful of time

00:34:04.830 --> 00:34:08.040
because I definitely get a
sense everyone's really paying

00:34:08.040 --> 00:34:09.835
attention and super focused.

00:34:09.835 --> 00:34:10.710
You don't understand.

00:34:10.710 --> 00:34:13.462
This is not generally a
laptops down community,

00:34:13.462 --> 00:34:14.920
so we try to
multi-task everything.

00:34:14.920 --> 00:34:15.181
KANWER SINGH: Oh, really?

00:34:15.181 --> 00:34:15.270
OK.

00:34:15.270 --> 00:34:16.210
TY WARD: And I don't
know if you've noticed.

00:34:16.210 --> 00:34:17.360
I don't even see one out.

00:34:17.360 --> 00:34:19.027
Everybody's just eyes
forward right now.

00:34:19.027 --> 00:34:20.070
So I sense--

00:34:20.070 --> 00:34:20.909
KANWER SINGH: Oh.

00:34:20.909 --> 00:34:22.159
We've got one with the laptop.

00:34:22.159 --> 00:34:24.000
He was like, oh,
crap, let me close it.

00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:24.900
TY WARD: Oh, oh, no.

00:34:24.900 --> 00:34:28.280
OK, so he's probably doing
something superficial

00:34:28.280 --> 00:34:29.280
that's related to--

00:34:29.280 --> 00:34:30.655
KANWER SINGH: Hey,
you know what?

00:34:30.655 --> 00:34:33.150
Listen, I'm one of the
people who is lucky enough

00:34:33.150 --> 00:34:36.373
to get invites to Zeitgeist,
and even once in a while,

00:34:36.373 --> 00:34:37.540
I got to pull out my laptop.

00:34:37.540 --> 00:34:38.219
TY WARD: Every once in a while.

00:34:38.219 --> 00:34:39.360
KANWER SINGH: Sometimes--

00:34:39.360 --> 00:34:40.090
TY WARD: Got to
scratch that itch.

00:34:40.090 --> 00:34:41.923
KANWER SINGH: Ah, I got
to check that email.

00:34:41.923 --> 00:34:43.050
I get it.

00:34:43.050 --> 00:34:44.575
Life happens in
real time, I get it.

00:34:44.575 --> 00:34:46.950
TY WARD: So I mean, if you're
cool with it, I'd love to--

00:34:46.950 --> 00:34:49.199
I feel like keeping it mystic.

00:34:49.199 --> 00:34:51.870
I'm getting a sense that there
are some questions out there

00:34:51.870 --> 00:34:53.400
in the audience for you.

00:34:53.400 --> 00:34:55.692
KANWER SINGH: I'm just saying,
you're making it mystic.

00:34:55.692 --> 00:34:58.160
I don't want anyone to think
that I consider myself mystic.

00:34:58.160 --> 00:35:00.210
TY WARD: I just like
mystical things.

00:35:00.210 --> 00:35:01.329
But are you cool with--

00:35:01.329 --> 00:35:02.162
KANWER SINGH: Yeah--

00:35:02.162 --> 00:35:02.995
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:35:02.995 --> 00:35:05.220
KANWER SINGH: 100%.

00:35:05.220 --> 00:35:06.450
TY WARD: All righty.

00:35:06.450 --> 00:35:07.520
This is a cool moment.

00:35:07.520 --> 00:35:08.645
KANWER SINGH: What is that?

00:35:08.645 --> 00:35:11.790
TY WARD: Question back
there, check this out.

00:35:11.790 --> 00:35:13.120
Almost over threw, I apologize.

00:35:13.120 --> 00:35:13.800
AUDIENCE: Hi, can you hear me?

00:35:13.800 --> 00:35:15.196
KANWER SINGH: Oh my god,
that's a microphone.

00:35:15.196 --> 00:35:15.870
TY WARD: Yes.

00:35:15.870 --> 00:35:17.010
KANWER SINGH: That is fly.

00:35:17.010 --> 00:35:19.760
AUDIENCE: Brown squares.

00:35:19.760 --> 00:35:22.247
So, thank you for coming.

00:35:22.247 --> 00:35:23.830
KANWER SINGH: Thank
you for having me.

00:35:23.830 --> 00:35:24.810
AUDIENCE: I think
it's coincidence

00:35:24.810 --> 00:35:26.610
or it's meant to be
that I would just

00:35:26.610 --> 00:35:29.637
finish watching Nipsey
Hussle's funeral service,

00:35:29.637 --> 00:35:30.720
and then coming into this.

00:35:30.720 --> 00:35:34.260
Because that was speaking
the truth, and so is this.

00:35:34.260 --> 00:35:40.350
On that note, who is your
top modern favorite rappers?

00:35:40.350 --> 00:35:44.460
KANWER SINGH: Artistically,
probably André 3000.

00:35:44.460 --> 00:35:47.350
Just everything he does
has just been fantastic.

00:35:47.350 --> 00:35:50.910
I think talking about
Nipsey Hussle in terms

00:35:50.910 --> 00:35:54.210
of people who dropped the
most gems and the jewels,

00:35:54.210 --> 00:35:55.560
it'll probably be.

00:35:55.560 --> 00:35:58.780
In their work, probably
Jay-Z drops the most wisdom.

00:35:58.780 --> 00:36:00.100
He's not really known for it.

00:36:00.100 --> 00:36:03.630
But if you take a listen,
especially his 4:44 album,

00:36:03.630 --> 00:36:05.833
that's like a manual
on how to be an adult.

00:36:05.833 --> 00:36:07.000
It's such a fantastic album.

00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:08.940
AUDIENCE: That's actually
my angel number, is 444.

00:36:08.940 --> 00:36:09.750
KANWER SINGH: 444?

00:36:09.750 --> 00:36:12.510
OK, yeah, so that
one's really good.

00:36:12.510 --> 00:36:15.060
I got two chapters in
here dedicated to lessons

00:36:15.060 --> 00:36:16.460
I learned from 50 Cent.

00:36:16.460 --> 00:36:17.460
TY WARD: That's awesome.

00:36:17.460 --> 00:36:18.450
KANWER SINGH: So
they're there as well.

00:36:18.450 --> 00:36:20.070
So 50 for me is a big one.

00:36:20.070 --> 00:36:23.390
And actually, Nipsey
Hussle, it was

00:36:23.390 --> 00:36:25.590
a-- and that's a
little heartbreaking

00:36:25.590 --> 00:36:30.580
situation, but probably a
week before it all happened,

00:36:30.580 --> 00:36:32.650
we had just
connected on Twitter.

00:36:32.650 --> 00:36:36.690
And my goal-- and I
landed here in LA.

00:36:36.690 --> 00:36:37.530
I got the news--

00:36:37.530 --> 00:36:39.100
I was flying back from India.

00:36:39.100 --> 00:36:43.650
So my flight was from Mumbai to
Frankfurt and Frankfurt to LA.

00:36:43.650 --> 00:36:45.890
And then landing in
Frankfurt, I found out.

00:36:45.890 --> 00:36:47.020
I got the news.

00:36:47.020 --> 00:36:50.010
And yeah, one of my goals
was like, all right,

00:36:50.010 --> 00:36:52.320
you going to let go of your
Canadian sensibilities.

00:36:52.320 --> 00:36:53.780
And you're going
to find this guy.

00:36:53.780 --> 00:36:55.950
You're going to keep poking
at him until he meets you.

00:36:55.950 --> 00:36:57.700
You're not going to
take no for an answer.

00:36:57.700 --> 00:37:00.000
And that was on my to do
list, this trip to LA.

00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:04.810
And it was a very
heartbreaking situation.

00:37:04.810 --> 00:37:07.062
But I do-- for those--

00:37:07.062 --> 00:37:09.270
a lot of people have heard
the news of Nipsey Hussle.

00:37:09.270 --> 00:37:12.600
I do really encourage you guys
to check out his interviews.

00:37:12.600 --> 00:37:15.695
He is one of the most-- and
that's how we connected.

00:37:15.695 --> 00:37:17.820
Because I said he's one of
the most important minds

00:37:17.820 --> 00:37:19.740
and has one of the
most important stories

00:37:19.740 --> 00:37:21.180
of our generation.

00:37:21.180 --> 00:37:24.120
And I think he appreciated
that, and we connected that way.

00:37:24.120 --> 00:37:28.800
But his story-- his
credits have rolled.

00:37:28.800 --> 00:37:30.660
And all we can do is
continue his legacy.

00:37:30.660 --> 00:37:34.890
But beyond that, yeah, 50
Cent, André 3000 as an artist.

00:37:34.890 --> 00:37:37.530
I'm loving what
Gambino does right now.

00:37:37.530 --> 00:37:41.310
I got to meet him years
ago, and he reminded me

00:37:41.310 --> 00:37:44.818
that the only reason I should be
doing this is because it's fun.

00:37:44.818 --> 00:37:46.860
He chases the fun, and
when you look at his work,

00:37:46.860 --> 00:37:49.102
you realize he's
literally chasing the fun.

00:37:49.102 --> 00:37:51.060
So I'm really trying to
follow in his footsteps

00:37:51.060 --> 00:37:52.477
and do the same.

00:37:52.477 --> 00:37:53.310
TY WARD: Absolutely.

00:37:53.310 --> 00:37:53.700
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:37:53.700 --> 00:37:54.700
TY WARD: Great question.

00:37:56.656 --> 00:37:59.255
Oh, oh, oh, oh, OK, all right.

00:37:59.255 --> 00:38:01.630
KANWER SINGH: So how often do
people get hit in the head?

00:38:01.630 --> 00:38:02.890
TY WARD: So it's soft.

00:38:02.890 --> 00:38:03.810
It's plush.

00:38:03.810 --> 00:38:05.840
In there somewhere
is a tiny microphone.

00:38:05.840 --> 00:38:06.780
KANWER SINGH: Oh, it's
a tiny microphone?

00:38:06.780 --> 00:38:07.650
Not like one of these.

00:38:07.650 --> 00:38:08.483
TY WARD: No, no, no.

00:38:08.483 --> 00:38:09.080
Yeah, yeah.

00:38:09.080 --> 00:38:10.320
AUDIENCE: You wouldn't want to
get hit in the head with it.

00:38:10.320 --> 00:38:11.430
TY WARD: No, you
wouldn't want to.

00:38:11.430 --> 00:38:11.910
But you might.

00:38:11.910 --> 00:38:13.170
AUDIENCE: It hurts, but it's--

00:38:13.170 --> 00:38:13.590
TY WARD: He made it.

00:38:13.590 --> 00:38:13.720
Look.

00:38:13.720 --> 00:38:15.450
AUDIENCE: Well,
yeah, I mean, I did.

00:38:15.450 --> 00:38:16.490
I'm expecting it.

00:38:16.490 --> 00:38:17.170
TY WARD: OK.

00:38:17.170 --> 00:38:18.170
You're absolutely right.

00:38:18.170 --> 00:38:22.040
AUDIENCE: Yeah, thanks
so much for coming today.

00:38:22.040 --> 00:38:25.690
I know you're talking about a
new slate or roster of artists,

00:38:25.690 --> 00:38:28.998
particularly Indian
artists kind of rising now.

00:38:28.998 --> 00:38:29.790
Where do you view--

00:38:29.790 --> 00:38:31.080
I mean, have you
seen "Gully Boy" yet?

00:38:31.080 --> 00:38:32.550
KANWER SINGH: Yeah, I
haven't seen the film,

00:38:32.550 --> 00:38:33.608
but I've seen the track.

00:38:33.608 --> 00:38:34.900
AUDIENCE: OK, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:38:34.900 --> 00:38:38.460
So I was just curious
if you had exposure

00:38:38.460 --> 00:38:43.970
to the growing, yet nascent
hip hop scene in India,

00:38:43.970 --> 00:38:45.470
and where do you
think that's going.

00:38:45.470 --> 00:38:46.810
KANWER SINGH: It's fantastic.

00:38:46.810 --> 00:38:48.185
It's fantastic on
so many levels.

00:38:48.185 --> 00:38:50.130
So coincidentally,
when I was in Mumbai,

00:38:50.130 --> 00:38:53.730
we ran into Ranveer, who stars
in that movie, at a party.

00:38:53.730 --> 00:38:55.410
And I have it on my Instagram.

00:38:55.410 --> 00:38:59.160
He rapped "Still D.R.E."

00:38:59.160 --> 00:38:59.840
end to end.

00:38:59.840 --> 00:39:00.540
AUDIENCE: Wow.

00:39:00.540 --> 00:39:02.640
KANWER SINGH: And then
later on in the party,

00:39:02.640 --> 00:39:06.120
he rapped "Hypnotize"
end to end.

00:39:06.120 --> 00:39:08.430
He knew all the words.

00:39:08.430 --> 00:39:12.700
The thing is with hip hop, hip
hop is like soccer for music.

00:39:12.700 --> 00:39:15.660
It's the most universal,
accessible musical art

00:39:15.660 --> 00:39:18.520
because you don't have to pay
for expensive guitar lessons.

00:39:18.520 --> 00:39:20.950
You don't have to
pay for equipment.

00:39:20.950 --> 00:39:25.080
All you need for hip hop
is a story and a beat.

00:39:25.080 --> 00:39:30.110
And we all kind of come with
a heartbeat out the box.

00:39:30.110 --> 00:39:34.050
It's also the tool of
the underrepresented

00:39:34.050 --> 00:39:35.430
to tell their stories.

00:39:35.430 --> 00:39:38.610
So in terms of
hip hop right now,

00:39:38.610 --> 00:39:43.050
it started 1520 Sedgwick
Avenue in the Bronx,

00:39:43.050 --> 00:39:46.360
and it expanded
slowly, but surely.

00:39:46.360 --> 00:39:49.830
And outside of English
speakers, the next language

00:39:49.830 --> 00:39:53.000
that has had a couple of decades
under the belt is French.

00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:57.000
So French hip hop has
evolved magnificently.

00:39:57.000 --> 00:40:03.660
The thing is, all the necessary
ingredients for hip hop

00:40:03.660 --> 00:40:07.500
to exist have always
been in India.

00:40:07.500 --> 00:40:09.360
All the major
languages in India--

00:40:09.360 --> 00:40:16.260
Hindi, Punjabi, Gujarati,
Urdu, Madrassi--

00:40:16.260 --> 00:40:19.680
all these languages,
they're already poetic.

00:40:19.680 --> 00:40:21.520
They're already made to rhyme.

00:40:21.520 --> 00:40:24.450
As I said, all the hymns that
my mother taught me growing up,

00:40:24.450 --> 00:40:26.400
they all rhyme.

00:40:26.400 --> 00:40:29.760
All the hymns are
written in poetry.

00:40:29.760 --> 00:40:30.760
You could rap them.

00:40:30.760 --> 00:40:32.940
AUDIENCE: Yeah, the Mahabharata
is like the longest poem ever.

00:40:32.940 --> 00:40:33.470
KANWER SINGH: Exactly.

00:40:33.470 --> 00:40:34.710
They're already poetry.

00:40:34.710 --> 00:40:36.990
So now this is just adding
poetry to your heartbeat.

00:40:36.990 --> 00:40:40.350
So from that perspective, it's
kind of always been there.

00:40:40.350 --> 00:40:43.570
It's kind of like when the
NBA realized, hey, if we go

00:40:43.570 --> 00:40:46.200
to Africa, everyone's so tall.

00:40:46.200 --> 00:40:50.300
We can start grooming these
players to join the league.

00:40:50.300 --> 00:40:52.050
I feel like that's
India's time right now.

00:40:52.050 --> 00:40:57.240
They're grooming the players
because you can't even

00:40:57.240 --> 00:41:00.670
compare a hood in the
US to a slum in India.

00:41:00.670 --> 00:41:02.400
It's a completely
different level

00:41:02.400 --> 00:41:03.792
of what they're going through.

00:41:03.792 --> 00:41:05.250
And their stories
are so important,

00:41:05.250 --> 00:41:07.140
and their emotions are so raw.

00:41:07.140 --> 00:41:09.760
And the art is so
prevalent there.

00:41:09.760 --> 00:41:14.520
And India is also the
mother of percussion.

00:41:14.520 --> 00:41:17.100
India and Africa is where
percussion came from.

00:41:17.100 --> 00:41:19.300
So from that perspective,
it's such a natural fit,

00:41:19.300 --> 00:41:21.290
and it's so exciting.

00:41:21.290 --> 00:41:23.770
Where it is right
now, it's amazing.

00:41:23.770 --> 00:41:27.420
So Raftaar, who's one of
the most prominent rappers

00:41:27.420 --> 00:41:30.440
out there right now, he's
a good friend of mine.

00:41:30.440 --> 00:41:32.850
But at the same time, it's
cool because on his hand,

00:41:32.850 --> 00:41:35.070
he has a game tattoo.

00:41:35.070 --> 00:41:36.990
He was inspired by the game.

00:41:36.990 --> 00:41:40.720
And he's probably a bigger
artist globally now.

00:41:40.720 --> 00:41:42.360
And so for me, it's
been exciting to be

00:41:42.360 --> 00:41:45.120
able to connect with these guys,
drop a track with these guys

00:41:45.120 --> 00:41:47.880
once a year, explore
rapping in Punjabi,

00:41:47.880 --> 00:41:50.598
explore rapping in Hindi,
kind of making it all happen.

00:41:50.598 --> 00:41:52.140
And I try to do it
more authentically

00:41:52.140 --> 00:41:53.470
the way I would
probably do it here,

00:41:53.470 --> 00:41:55.470
which is I speak half
English, half Punjabi when

00:41:55.470 --> 00:41:56.580
I'm with my friends.

00:41:56.580 --> 00:41:58.110
I would rap and
do the same thing.

00:41:58.110 --> 00:41:59.193
And there's that movement.

00:41:59.193 --> 00:42:01.100
There's the hip hop,
and just meeting

00:42:01.100 --> 00:42:02.700
a couple of other artists
and how they're doing it.

00:42:02.700 --> 00:42:05.200
So I'm actually working with a
company called Saavn as well,

00:42:05.200 --> 00:42:07.950
which is owned by Jio,
which is the big telecom

00:42:07.950 --> 00:42:08.700
company out there.

00:42:08.700 --> 00:42:11.640
And they're putting cell
phones in everybody's hands.

00:42:11.640 --> 00:42:13.180
So the movement is coming.

00:42:13.180 --> 00:42:15.138
And I know they just
recently released a track.

00:42:15.138 --> 00:42:17.640
Ranveer actually has
a track with Nas.

00:42:17.640 --> 00:42:19.930
And it's fantastic
because what's

00:42:19.930 --> 00:42:23.290
popular there is what was
popular here in the 90s.

00:42:23.290 --> 00:42:26.680
So it's like that boom
bap, the hard core stuff.

00:42:26.680 --> 00:42:28.360
They don't want you
to slow it down.

00:42:28.360 --> 00:42:29.530
They want that Eminem.

00:42:29.530 --> 00:42:32.770
They want that lyrical
miracle super fast stuff.

00:42:32.770 --> 00:42:34.390
And out here,
you're being taught,

00:42:34.390 --> 00:42:36.370
hey, no, you've got to
make it more melodic.

00:42:36.370 --> 00:42:38.328
You've got to make it
simpler to understand it,

00:42:38.328 --> 00:42:39.500
to make it more digestible.

00:42:39.500 --> 00:42:41.510
So it's a breath of fresh air.

00:42:41.510 --> 00:42:45.580
And I'm looking forward to
contributing to that culture

00:42:45.580 --> 00:42:47.890
the best way I know how and
kind of moving it forward.

00:42:47.890 --> 00:42:51.220
And Bollywood has always
had this reputation

00:42:51.220 --> 00:42:54.860
of being a parody of
North American culture.

00:42:54.860 --> 00:42:56.860
They'll have their cheesy
version of Spider-Man.

00:42:56.860 --> 00:42:58.777
They'll have their cheesy
version of whatever.

00:42:58.777 --> 00:43:01.360
This is an opportunity
for us not to have

00:43:01.360 --> 00:43:02.710
a cheesy version of hip hop.

00:43:02.710 --> 00:43:04.600
We can have an
authentic version of it.

00:43:04.600 --> 00:43:05.620
And we can look--

00:43:05.620 --> 00:43:09.250
especially for me, I believe we
should look to folks in France

00:43:09.250 --> 00:43:10.270
because they found that.

00:43:10.270 --> 00:43:12.350
And I feel like the UK
is doing the same thing.

00:43:12.350 --> 00:43:14.770
UK, they had a lot of
rappers in the beginning.

00:43:14.770 --> 00:43:17.777
Then once they found grime,
that became their own thing.

00:43:17.777 --> 00:43:19.360
And I think that's
kind of what it is.

00:43:19.360 --> 00:43:21.880
You have to sound
like your heroes

00:43:21.880 --> 00:43:23.630
until you find your own voice.

00:43:23.630 --> 00:43:25.390
And I think India
is having its time

00:43:25.390 --> 00:43:26.980
to sound like
their heroes, but I

00:43:26.980 --> 00:43:28.393
want us to find our own voice.

00:43:28.393 --> 00:43:29.560
AUDIENCE: Thank you so much.

00:43:29.560 --> 00:43:30.352
KANWER SINGH: Yeah.

00:43:33.210 --> 00:43:34.325
TY WARD: Other questions?

00:43:41.760 --> 00:43:44.180
AUDIENCE: Thank you so
much for coming over here.

00:43:44.180 --> 00:43:46.910
My question is more
about philosophy.

00:43:46.910 --> 00:43:48.080
of the Sikh.

00:43:48.080 --> 00:43:50.870
To me, it was always
something to do with warriors

00:43:50.870 --> 00:43:52.500
and the warrior's spirit.

00:43:52.500 --> 00:43:55.970
And I was wondering
in your life overall,

00:43:55.970 --> 00:43:57.240
how does it impact you?

00:43:57.240 --> 00:44:00.350
How do you apply
daily through life's--

00:44:00.350 --> 00:44:03.290
I don't know-- trials,
obstacles, and--

00:44:03.290 --> 00:44:06.830
KANWER SINGH: I think
one of the symbols--

00:44:06.830 --> 00:44:08.100
we have a double-edged sword.

00:44:08.100 --> 00:44:11.040
And the double-edged sword
represents [INAUDIBLE]

00:44:11.040 --> 00:44:12.930
which is spiritual
power and temporal power

00:44:12.930 --> 00:44:14.420
or being involved politically.

00:44:14.420 --> 00:44:18.560
So historically,
there were saints.

00:44:18.560 --> 00:44:20.940
There were soldiers, and
everything in between.

00:44:20.940 --> 00:44:22.880
And now kind of,
it's amalgamated

00:44:22.880 --> 00:44:26.030
where you're supposed to be
the saint and the soldier.

00:44:26.030 --> 00:44:30.200
But I think from a pragmatic
level, it makes a lot of sense.

00:44:30.200 --> 00:44:33.920
You're not being encouraged to
isolate yourself from the world

00:44:33.920 --> 00:44:36.320
and sit in your room and
meditate all the time,

00:44:36.320 --> 00:44:41.570
and avoid challenges,
avoid temptation, and avoid

00:44:41.570 --> 00:44:42.800
all these things.

00:44:42.800 --> 00:44:44.900
You're encouraged to
be out in the world,

00:44:44.900 --> 00:44:50.430
and be assertive and
view things accordingly.

00:44:50.430 --> 00:44:53.600
So for me, I know
growing up, I probably

00:44:53.600 --> 00:44:57.380
connected much more with Malcolm
X than with Martin Luther King.

00:44:57.380 --> 00:44:59.000
I connected with
[INAUDIBLE] much more

00:44:59.000 --> 00:45:01.190
than I did with Mahatma Gandhi.

00:45:05.240 --> 00:45:07.700
Many people don't even know
that like Nelson Mandela,

00:45:07.700 --> 00:45:10.670
there was a militant wing
for some of the things

00:45:10.670 --> 00:45:12.560
that he did in the early on.

00:45:12.560 --> 00:45:16.400
And I think for me, I
always kind of viewed

00:45:16.400 --> 00:45:19.130
people-- that is a lot more
pragmatic in understanding

00:45:19.130 --> 00:45:22.970
that sometimes, when fighting
oppression, you have to fight.

00:45:22.970 --> 00:45:25.610
You can't simply sit in
or do a hunger strike.

00:45:25.610 --> 00:45:27.320
You have to actually fight.

00:45:27.320 --> 00:45:29.300
You have to speak up.

00:45:29.300 --> 00:45:33.650
And now in modern
sense, for me, that just

00:45:33.650 --> 00:45:35.900
means you can't be
passive aggressive.

00:45:35.900 --> 00:45:37.400
You have to speak
in straight lines.

00:45:37.400 --> 00:45:40.400
You have to be
clear with people.

00:45:40.400 --> 00:45:46.040
Peace isn't always available,
and peace can always

00:45:46.040 --> 00:45:46.950
be a priority.

00:45:46.950 --> 00:45:50.220
And I love a quote
from Steve Jobs,

00:45:50.220 --> 00:45:53.382
where he talked about the
rock tumbler and everyone

00:45:53.382 --> 00:45:55.340
criticizing him for the
friction at his office.

00:45:55.340 --> 00:45:57.590
And he's like, you put
rocks in a rock tumbler,

00:45:57.590 --> 00:46:00.110
and the friction
polishes all the rocks.

00:46:00.110 --> 00:46:02.450
And I noticed that with
myself, and I grew up

00:46:02.450 --> 00:46:05.090
in a challenging
neighborhood in Toronto,

00:46:05.090 --> 00:46:07.340
where we spoke a certain
way to each other.

00:46:07.340 --> 00:46:09.418
And then once I got
a little bit older,

00:46:09.418 --> 00:46:11.585
and started meeting people
from other neighborhoods,

00:46:11.585 --> 00:46:15.390
and realizing that I was
considered crass or rude,

00:46:15.390 --> 00:46:17.030
and not feeling
that I was myself.

00:46:17.030 --> 00:46:22.400
I felt I was just a direct
communicator and feeling

00:46:22.400 --> 00:46:25.550
that it's OK for there to
be a little bit of conflict.

00:46:25.550 --> 00:46:28.400
It's OK for there to be
a little bit of friction

00:46:28.400 --> 00:46:31.190
because from that,
a lot can grow.

00:46:31.190 --> 00:46:37.910
We, as a species, are safer
now than we've ever been.

00:46:37.910 --> 00:46:41.780
But we're more sensitive
to negative news

00:46:41.780 --> 00:46:42.840
and negative violence.

00:46:42.840 --> 00:46:45.110
And I think that we
might be doing ourselves

00:46:45.110 --> 00:46:46.390
a disservice because of that.

00:46:46.390 --> 00:46:49.520
And so for me and my
heritage, really promoting

00:46:49.520 --> 00:46:52.070
being prepared all
the time, it really

00:46:52.070 --> 00:46:56.570
means being able to
operate in any ecosystem.

00:46:56.570 --> 00:47:00.420
And for me, that's always been
being the guy who stood out.

00:47:00.420 --> 00:47:03.320
I can never be a fly on the
wall when I went certain places

00:47:03.320 --> 00:47:09.880
or being in a country where 99%
of the people think I'm Muslim.

00:47:09.880 --> 00:47:13.340
And 101% of the
time, I'm randomly

00:47:13.340 --> 00:47:17.630
screened at the airport, and
really being mindful of this

00:47:17.630 --> 00:47:20.480
and saying to myself, OK, well,
what are the things that I can

00:47:20.480 --> 00:47:22.478
do, and saying, hey,
well, 20 years ago,

00:47:22.478 --> 00:47:24.770
the average American, if they
thought beard and turban,

00:47:24.770 --> 00:47:27.350
they thought Osama bin Laden.

00:47:27.350 --> 00:47:31.040
What can I do now so when
the average person thinks

00:47:31.040 --> 00:47:32.820
of beard and turban,
they think of Humble?

00:47:32.820 --> 00:47:34.487
And when they think
of Humble, they just

00:47:34.487 --> 00:47:35.870
think of funny, silly guy?

00:47:35.870 --> 00:47:39.710
Like, fun-loving, great person
as opposed to he represe--

00:47:39.710 --> 00:47:42.920
and I'm sure no other gentleman
with a beard and turban

00:47:42.920 --> 00:47:46.400
would have an issue being seen
as a fun person, versus what

00:47:46.400 --> 00:47:47.600
we had to deal with--

00:47:47.600 --> 00:47:50.385
me growing up, going to New
York the first time in 2004,

00:47:50.385 --> 00:47:52.760
and the type of challenges
that I went through with that.

00:47:52.760 --> 00:47:55.940
But now, as an adult, I
see the value in that.

00:47:55.940 --> 00:47:57.650
If I had children,
I probably wouldn't

00:47:57.650 --> 00:48:00.600
want to shield them from that.

00:48:00.600 --> 00:48:02.100
I think it built a
lot of character,

00:48:02.100 --> 00:48:03.267
and it put me in a position.

00:48:03.267 --> 00:48:06.470
And as well, I think the irony
of how the story has moved now

00:48:06.470 --> 00:48:09.605
is there's so much.

00:48:09.605 --> 00:48:11.480
I grew up in a world
where people are pushing

00:48:11.480 --> 00:48:13.425
us to tolerate diversity.

00:48:13.425 --> 00:48:15.050
And I think now we're
realizing that we

00:48:15.050 --> 00:48:16.340
don't tolerate diversity.

00:48:16.340 --> 00:48:18.830
We celebrate diversity.

00:48:18.830 --> 00:48:21.885
Diversity, multiculturalism,
all of that, it's fantastic.

00:48:21.885 --> 00:48:22.940
[APPLAUSE]

00:48:22.940 --> 00:48:23.730
Thank you.

00:48:23.730 --> 00:48:24.730
Well, you guys are dope.

00:48:24.730 --> 00:48:26.855
This is LA, so you guys
are all fantastic out here.

00:48:26.855 --> 00:48:28.490
But I think it's
just at a point now

00:48:28.490 --> 00:48:31.100
where people are seeing
the benefits of it.

00:48:31.100 --> 00:48:32.623
It is good for
every single person,

00:48:32.623 --> 00:48:34.040
and we have so
much more in common

00:48:34.040 --> 00:48:35.360
than we have differences.

00:48:35.360 --> 00:48:37.410
And now it's a
challenge for even

00:48:37.410 --> 00:48:39.580
me to speak to my community
and be like, all right,

00:48:39.580 --> 00:48:42.710
you guys wanted to be
accepted because you chose

00:48:42.710 --> 00:48:44.380
to wear turbans and beards.

00:48:44.380 --> 00:48:48.220
You guys need to accept that
man for loving another man.

00:48:48.220 --> 00:48:50.650
You need to accept that woman
for loving another woman.

00:48:50.650 --> 00:48:52.960
You need to accept that
person over there who

00:48:52.960 --> 00:48:54.910
decided they grew
up one way, but they

00:48:54.910 --> 00:48:56.620
want to be something else.

00:48:56.620 --> 00:48:59.932
And you don't get to have
an opinion on their choices,

00:48:59.932 --> 00:49:02.140
especially since their
choices have no impact on you.

00:49:02.140 --> 00:49:04.250
And it's just challenging
a belief that you have.

00:49:04.250 --> 00:49:07.510
So I'm seeing this, and
I've experienced racism

00:49:07.510 --> 00:49:09.545
at the hands of
homosexuals and kind

00:49:09.545 --> 00:49:11.920
of being like, hey, we're
supposed to be on the same team

00:49:11.920 --> 00:49:12.420
here.

00:49:12.420 --> 00:49:14.200
We're oppressed
minorities in some sense.

00:49:14.200 --> 00:49:16.810
But you realize
that human nature

00:49:16.810 --> 00:49:19.030
has this kind of really--
divide and conquer

00:49:19.030 --> 00:49:22.480
is a very efficient
way to control people.

00:49:22.480 --> 00:49:26.330
So trying to be mindful of
that and finding the best ways

00:49:26.330 --> 00:49:28.570
to fight those battles,
and I was actually

00:49:28.570 --> 00:49:31.360
telling some friends back home.

00:49:31.360 --> 00:49:33.580
I said, the Sikhs are
known for being warriors.

00:49:33.580 --> 00:49:38.140
But we started losing
a lot more battles

00:49:38.140 --> 00:49:39.940
when the battles became--

00:49:39.940 --> 00:49:42.640
when the bullets
became information.

00:49:42.640 --> 00:49:46.570
We don't have the necessary
mechanisms in place

00:49:46.570 --> 00:49:49.060
when it's information warfare.

00:49:49.060 --> 00:49:52.380
We don't have relationships
with the media

00:49:52.380 --> 00:49:55.780
to change stories if
people are being attacked.

00:49:55.780 --> 00:49:59.550
We don't have the necessary
relationship with sponsors

00:49:59.550 --> 00:50:03.130
to be like, hey,
this publication

00:50:03.130 --> 00:50:05.560
is spreading false information.

00:50:05.560 --> 00:50:07.780
Can we lean on them with
your sponsorship dollars

00:50:07.780 --> 00:50:09.370
to ensure that doesn't happen?

00:50:09.370 --> 00:50:12.220
We don't have the most
effective lobbying groups.

00:50:12.220 --> 00:50:14.830
So this is our next
level of warriorness,

00:50:14.830 --> 00:50:17.440
because folks are still
thinking warriors is picking up

00:50:17.440 --> 00:50:18.490
the sword.

00:50:18.490 --> 00:50:19.090
And it's not.

00:50:19.090 --> 00:50:21.670
The battles are internal,
and the new external battles

00:50:21.670 --> 00:50:23.972
are not going to be fought
on the battlefield anymore.

00:50:23.972 --> 00:50:25.930
They're going to be fought
behind the computer.

00:50:25.930 --> 00:50:28.120
They're going to be fought
with political donations.

00:50:28.120 --> 00:50:29.495
They're going be
fought that way.

00:50:29.495 --> 00:50:33.730
And I think just
learning that art of war,

00:50:33.730 --> 00:50:35.853
I think is important for
everybody in general.

00:50:35.853 --> 00:50:37.270
And specifically,
that's something

00:50:37.270 --> 00:50:41.430
that I'm trying to push upon
the people in my community.

00:50:41.430 --> 00:50:42.350
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:50:42.350 --> 00:50:43.750
Thank you.

00:50:43.750 --> 00:50:45.772
KANWER SINGH: We got to wrap up.

00:50:45.772 --> 00:50:47.480
TY WARD: All right,
so I think we're kind

00:50:47.480 --> 00:50:49.420
of out of time for questions.

00:50:49.420 --> 00:50:53.595
But I'm curious do we have time
for one more special thing?

00:50:53.595 --> 00:50:55.970
All right, so a picture is
worth a thousand words, right?

00:50:55.970 --> 00:51:00.370
But I feel like spoken
word is priceless.

00:51:00.370 --> 00:51:02.710
And we talked about
this beforehand.

00:51:02.710 --> 00:51:06.588
I'd love to get you to give
us some spoken word right now.

00:51:06.588 --> 00:51:07.630
KANWER SINGH: Definitely.

00:51:07.630 --> 00:51:11.552
OK, so this one I wrote
in honor of my father.

00:51:11.552 --> 00:51:13.010
It's called "Life
of an Immigrant."

00:51:13.010 --> 00:51:15.400
And it was inspired
by his story.

00:51:15.400 --> 00:51:19.547
So my father came to
Canada in the early 70s.

00:51:19.547 --> 00:51:21.130
He had a master's
degree in economics,

00:51:21.130 --> 00:51:24.880
but he immediately got to
work in a furniture factory

00:51:24.880 --> 00:51:26.710
while he saved up to
get his taxi license.

00:51:26.710 --> 00:51:32.500
And then he drove a taxi
probably from '75 to 2015

00:51:32.500 --> 00:51:34.000
when he retired.

00:51:34.000 --> 00:51:38.410
And he was always an
academic, but never got

00:51:38.410 --> 00:51:40.180
to pursue academics.

00:51:40.180 --> 00:51:42.180
And I always thought that
was super interesting.

00:51:42.180 --> 00:51:43.722
And it did help me
develop a big chip

00:51:43.722 --> 00:51:46.180
on my shoulder as to
what I needed to be

00:51:46.180 --> 00:51:49.265
to prove his sacrifices right.

00:51:49.265 --> 00:51:51.140
And that in itself became
a challenge for me.

00:51:51.140 --> 00:51:52.682
But I did write a
piece in his honor.

00:51:52.682 --> 00:51:55.930
It's called "Life
of an immigrant."

00:51:55.930 --> 00:51:58.960
Told him the grass was
greener, what an endless flood

00:51:58.960 --> 00:52:00.160
of possibilities.

00:52:00.160 --> 00:52:02.590
Katrina, watch
him drown in debt.

00:52:02.590 --> 00:52:04.630
Land confiscated by
the local government,

00:52:04.630 --> 00:52:07.680
so he flies high in a
jet plane, plain clothed,

00:52:07.680 --> 00:52:10.030
just expose them to the
harsh wonders of life.

00:52:10.030 --> 00:52:12.630
And his wife won't know
about the sweat soaked

00:52:12.630 --> 00:52:14.200
in the bank notes sent home.

00:52:14.200 --> 00:52:16.690
Boy getting grown,
he starts to groan.

00:52:16.690 --> 00:52:18.220
His stomach's rumbling.

00:52:18.220 --> 00:52:19.900
Hungry for a better
life, now he's

00:52:19.900 --> 00:52:23.080
stumbling over foreign
phonetics and those verb tenses.

00:52:23.080 --> 00:52:24.520
They're laughing at his accent.

00:52:24.520 --> 00:52:27.830
It's not an accident, though,
that his masters in economics

00:52:27.830 --> 00:52:28.870
isn't honored.

00:52:28.870 --> 00:52:31.930
Most economic forefather
to hop his ass in a cab

00:52:31.930 --> 00:52:35.320
and never bother getting
out that car or his dreams.

00:52:35.320 --> 00:52:37.930
Memorize the route
and collect the fare.

00:52:37.930 --> 00:52:40.870
It isn't fair when they
say you don't belong here

00:52:40.870 --> 00:52:43.900
with your long beard and
that towel around your head.

00:52:43.900 --> 00:52:45.200
Hear what was said.

00:52:45.200 --> 00:52:46.510
Soak in the heat.

00:52:46.510 --> 00:52:48.160
Can you relate?

00:52:48.160 --> 00:52:50.006
Life of an immigrant.

00:52:50.006 --> 00:52:52.434
[APPLAUSE]

00:52:52.434 --> 00:52:52.934
Thank you.

00:52:56.850 --> 00:53:00.970
TY WARD: I gotta say, man,
it's been a real, real fun

00:53:00.970 --> 00:53:02.350
time talking to you.

00:53:02.350 --> 00:53:02.870
KANWER SINGH: I had
a lot of fun, man.

00:53:02.870 --> 00:53:03.420
I appreciate it.

00:53:03.420 --> 00:53:05.628
TY WARD: I feel like we're
just homies up here, which

00:53:05.628 --> 00:53:07.300
is like the best way
they say you learn.

00:53:07.300 --> 00:53:08.260
KANWER SINGH: And I
appreciate everybody

00:53:08.260 --> 00:53:10.180
here skipping Coachella
to come see me.

00:53:10.180 --> 00:53:11.770
That's the story
I'm telling myself.

00:53:11.770 --> 00:53:12.980
They all have free tickets.

00:53:12.980 --> 00:53:15.160
And they're like, no.

00:53:15.160 --> 00:53:17.170
And this is probably the
entire population of LA

00:53:17.170 --> 00:53:18.590
that's not in Coachella.

00:53:18.590 --> 00:53:20.392
So I appreciate every
single one of you.

00:53:20.392 --> 00:53:21.100
TY WARD: Exactly.

00:53:21.100 --> 00:53:22.240
If you noticed,
your Uber ride was

00:53:22.240 --> 00:53:22.630
like lightning speed over here.

00:53:22.630 --> 00:53:23.970
KANWER SINGH: Yeah, I got
here just like-- yeah,

00:53:23.970 --> 00:53:26.120
normally, it's like 45 minutes,
and I got here in seven.

00:53:26.120 --> 00:53:27.210
TY WARD: Yeah, exactly.

00:53:27.210 --> 00:53:29.710
He probably got here
before you left.

00:53:29.710 --> 00:53:33.917
Well, I really gotta say, man,
thank you for sparing the time

00:53:33.917 --> 00:53:35.750
and coming through and
really talking to us.

00:53:35.750 --> 00:53:38.410
I really hope that everybody
got a lot out of this.

00:53:38.410 --> 00:53:43.223
As we noted, Humble's book
"Unlearn" is out right now.

00:53:43.223 --> 00:53:45.640
If you did not get here early
enough to get your own copy,

00:53:45.640 --> 00:53:48.130
you can definitely buy
a copy off of Amazon.

00:53:48.130 --> 00:53:49.030
It's a great book.

00:53:49.030 --> 00:53:50.498
I have not finished
reading it yet,

00:53:50.498 --> 00:53:52.540
but the best part is,
every single day I can just

00:53:52.540 --> 00:53:53.800
pop open to a new page.

00:53:53.800 --> 00:53:56.860
And it's just like
exactly what I needed.

00:53:56.860 --> 00:53:57.900
KANWER SINGH: Thank you.

00:53:57.900 --> 00:54:00.650
[APPLAUSE]
