personally I've always found that in the

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:28.410
personally I've always found that in the
 

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:29.990
personally I've always found that in the
past if I've tried to stick to any kind

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:30.000
past if I've tried to stick to any kind
 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:31.670
past if I've tried to stick to any kind
of schedule then it just piles on the

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:31.680
of schedule then it just piles on the
 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:32.960
of schedule then it just piles on the
pressure and if anything just makes me

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:32.970
pressure and if anything just makes me
 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:34.550
pressure and if anything just makes me
feel less creative but I do now think

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:34.560
feel less creative but I do now think
 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:36.110
feel less creative but I do now think
that having the right kind of schedule

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:36.120
that having the right kind of schedule
 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:38.690
that having the right kind of schedule
for example can also help to encourage

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:38.700
for example can also help to encourage
 

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:40.070
for example can also help to encourage
creativity as well I guess if you're

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:40.080
creativity as well I guess if you're
 

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:41.150
creativity as well I guess if you're
gonna have a schedule make sure you're

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:41.160
gonna have a schedule make sure you're
 

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:42.920
gonna have a schedule make sure you're
doing it for your own benefit as opposed

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:42.930
doing it for your own benefit as opposed
 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:44.540
doing it for your own benefit as opposed
to the assumed benefit of getting more

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:44.550
to the assumed benefit of getting more
 

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:46.070
to the assumed benefit of getting more
hits or whatever when it comes to all of

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:46.080
hits or whatever when it comes to all of
 

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:47.360
hits or whatever when it comes to all of
these rules the main thing about them

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:47.370
these rules the main thing about them
 

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:49.190
these rules the main thing about them
really is that they are all specifically

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:49.200
really is that they are all specifically
 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:50.690
really is that they are all specifically
tailored for me so I wouldn't want

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:50.700
tailored for me so I wouldn't want
 

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:52.370
tailored for me so I wouldn't want
anyone to just automatically take all of

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:52.380
anyone to just automatically take all of
 

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:53.900
anyone to just automatically take all of
these things and just say that's the way

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:53.910
these things and just say that's the way
 

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:55.490
these things and just say that's the way
I'm gonna do it too because different

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:55.500
I'm gonna do it too because different
 

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:56.720
I'm gonna do it too because different
things work for different people so if

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:56.730
things work for different people so if
 

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:58.220
things work for different people so if
you don't agree with anything that I've

00:02:58.220 --> 00:02:58.230
you don't agree with anything that I've
 

00:02:58.230 --> 00:02:59.960
you don't agree with anything that I've
said in these videos then just do the

00:02:59.960 --> 00:02:59.970
said in these videos then just do the
 

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:01.550
said in these videos then just do the
opposite because if that is what feels

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:01.560
opposite because if that is what feels
 

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:03.110
opposite because if that is what feels
right for you that it is also probably

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:03.120
right for you that it is also probably
 

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:06.620
right for you that it is also probably
what will work for you the end you've

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:06.630
what will work for you the end you've
 

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:08.690
what will work for you the end you've

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:11.780
just had the almost imponderable joy of
watching Charlie is so cool like which

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:11.790
