00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:03.402
So first let's look at a little bit more in detail a,

00:00:03.402 --> 00:00:07.730
a very well-known form of a camera, a single-lens reflex camera.

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:09.320
This is an example of one.

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:11.330
It has a lens and the whole body.

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:13.170
I'm going to take the lens off.

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:16.690
And it basically now can see more details of this camera.

00:00:16.690 --> 00:00:19.170
We'll look at it much more in detail in a few seconds.

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:22.940
But you basically see that there are certain aspects of this camera.

00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:24.490
There's a viewfinder.

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:27.590
In there there is a mirror which moves away.

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:30.200
We'll see examples of that a lot.

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:34.240
And of course, this is where the shutter release is.

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:36.750
So this is a standard film camera here.

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:37.870
I wanted to also show you this.

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:41.840
Most of your concern that I've exposed film, this was an exposed film already.

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:45.390
We will be looking at more detail what a film like this looks like.

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:49.310
But this is again, you know, one of the more widely used form factors for

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:50.420
professional photography.

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:57.210
So here I'm showing you now a cut out of the same camera, or similar camera.

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:00.310
Here you can see all of the details that we looked at.

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:02.630
This where the view finder was.

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:05.790
The focus, or zoom ring and the lens.

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:09.360
And I took this out before I showed you any of this stuff, were right here.

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.040
The shutter release button is right there.

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:14.970
This is the one that when you press opens the mechanism, so

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:17.680
let the light in to where the film would be.

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:22.860
The lenses are all in the mechanisms right here.

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:24.230
There is a diaphragm.

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:26.930
And we'll talk about the diaphragm and all of that kinds of stuff.

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:30.930
Because that's where all of the openings are controlled between these

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:35.170
lenses to allow the right kinds of light into the camera.

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:38.710
And of course this was a film camera, so there is where the film is.

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:41.300
In the new modern digital cameras of course,

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:45.030
the film has been replaced by a CCD sensor or CMOS sensor.

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:49.020
Again, something we will be looking at in much more detail later.

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:53.030
And all of the focal plane shutters are all mechanisms that are built in here.

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:56.610
That actually let again, different things happen in terms of

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:58.770
how the focal planes and everything as I suggested,

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:03.380
to get the right kinds of light into, to where the film is.

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:06.680
Now, of course, you noticed, and I showed you the thing, there was a glass here.

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:08.530
Basically single-lens reflex,

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:11.680
this thing opens to allow you to get the light in correctly.

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:14.870
And this, the prismatic sensor, that let's the light into the viewfinder so

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:17.990
the viewfinder can see exactly what the lens is seeing.

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:21.058
And as soon as the shutter is released, the mirror moves up and

00:02:21.058 --> 00:02:23.790
then the light basically goes and hits the film.

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:28.044
So you actually get to see exactly what you're seeing will the one,

00:02:28.044 --> 00:02:30.293
the image that will be registered.

00:02:30.293 --> 00:02:33.480
And actually then imaged on the sensor or the film
