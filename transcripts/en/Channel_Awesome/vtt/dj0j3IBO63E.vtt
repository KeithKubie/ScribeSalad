00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:04.400
Hello, I'm the Nostalgia Critic. 
I remember it, so you don't have to!

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:06.860
And seeing how we're still in the month of
 "Nostalgia-ween"!

00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:10.680
[Charlie Brown theme]

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:14.680
Random Psycho: RAAAA! HAHAHAHAHAH!

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:17.500
I figure we would play a little game

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:20.740
simply known as: "The Stephen King Drinking Game".

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:23.240
[music and applause]

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:29.800
Good Ol' Stephen King!
 His pros are great, but his stories are crap.

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:32.300
He has wonderful set-ups, but disappointing payoffs.

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:38.260
He creates some great characters and fortunately you get to see them over, and over, and over again.

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:44.020
And one of the best ways to see his continuing patterns is to look at the ass-numbingly long T.V. mini-series: "IT"

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:48.120
[theme music]

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:51.800
Based on the Stephen King book of the same name

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:55.340
"It" is another one of those films that loves to succumb to the melodramatic,

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:58.840
clichÃ©s that always seems to 
make it to every one of his stories.

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:00.460
But what really surprises me

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:03.460
is how many people say they're actually 
AFRAID of this movie!

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:06.780
And that's why I've invented this 
drinking game to calm your nerves.

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:10.860
There's a lot of movie to watch and a lot of booze to drink, so let's take a look!

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:15.400
First of all, take a shot if your Stephen King story takes place in Maine.

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.320
Well, That didn't take long.

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:21.440
Yeah, our story takes place in Maine,

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:26.560
where everybody has a checkered past, bullies make up most of the population, and cheesy lightning effects reign supreme.

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.340
*Cheesy Lightning effect intensifies*

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:32.860
In this particular town, we come across a girl 
who sees a rather unusual sight.

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:34.860
"Hi!"

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:35.840
Tim Curry!

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:39.780
And if that's not scary enough, it looks like he's 
coming from the black mass of Ronald McDonald

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:43.060
[monster-like roaring]

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:49.740
So the kid gets murdered as Mike, the only Black man in Maine, notices that this is the 6th recent child killing.

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:52.880
So he calls up his old childhood friends 
to let them know what's going on.

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:56.020
He start with Bill, who grew up 
into the back of a horse's ass.

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:59.360
Mike: "This is Mike Hanlon, Bill. From Derry."

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:01.220
This causes him to have a flashback,

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:04.480
Which I'm NOT going to have you drink 
to every time it happens because if you did,

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:06.480
You'd be DEAD in the first twelve minutes!

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:09.140
"Please Bill, tell me a story."

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:12.960
"Go b-bug someone else you little cootie, 
I don't feel so hot."

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:16.200
This is Bill as a young man, 
played by Jonathan Brandeis.

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:17.580
Piss off!

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:18.580
Hmmm.

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:22.120
He makes his brother, Georgie, a 
paper boat for him to sail outside.

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:26.320
Thankfully it's the sunniest rainy day in history, 
so he can go outside and enjoy it.

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:29.960
That is, until the missing member of the 
"Insane Clown Posse" comes to join him.

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:34.660
"There's cotton candy, and rides, 
and all sorts of surprises down here."

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:36.120
"And balloons too!"

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:37.800
"Do they float?"

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:39.640
"Oh yes..."

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:43.240
"They float, Georgie..."

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:46.040
"They float."

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:50.060
I'm getting surprisingly aroused the more 
I talk about how much they float!

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:53.160
"YOU'LL...FLOAT...TOO!"

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:57.040
[screaming]

00:02:57.240 --> 00:03:02.520
So the kid gets eaten by a sloppy dissolve effect, as his sad brother goes into his room feeling responsible.

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:06.000
And it's fair to point out that
this is actually a creepy scene here.

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:09.160
[eerie music]

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:15.820
The book starts to have its time of the month
when Bill calls for his folks to see it.

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:18.920
But the parents surprisingly don't
 seem to see the blood on the book.

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:21.020
"What were you doing in Georgie's room?"

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:23.540
"N-Nothing...Dad listen--!"

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:26.300
"I don't want you ever coming in here again, son."

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:28.040
"Do you understand?"

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:31.280
How dare you try to mourn the loss
of your one and only brother?!

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:33.040
[slapping sound]

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:37.020
Cut back to the present day, as grown up Bill 
decides it's time to go back to Maine.

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:39.540
"Leave? Have you lost your mind?"

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:41.760
"We're in the middle of making a movie!"

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:42.920
Bill: "They can replace me."

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:46.420
Yeah, if I saw Tim Curry in a clown suit, 
I'd probably leave production too.

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:49.320
Oh, by the way, just to avoid future disappointment:

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:52.080
Let's take an early shot for a supernatural creature,

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:57.500
who's not given an explanation of exactly 
what it is, or where exactly it came from.

00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:01.460
Oooohhh, that's good let down!

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:05.700
Meanwhile, we cut to another childhood 
friend named Ben, played by John Ritter.

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:07.220
Ben: "Would you believe I used to be fat?"

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:09.120
Random Hooker: "I bet you were real cute."

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:11.840
"No, not just fat, but a regular butterball."

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:18.340
"You bet your fern I was. We used to say that as kids, 'you bet your fern', but I was F-A-T."

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:20.080
Random Hooker: "Nooo..."
Ben: "Yeah."

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:23.880
Oh... Fat kids are hot! Tell me about your boy tits!

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:25.280
[phone rings]

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:28.520
"Hello?"
Mike: "Haystack. It's me Mike."

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:30.900
"You're dead fat boy."

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:34.580
Okay, these flashback 
transitions are getting a little silly.

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:38.520
(Extreme close up! WOOOOOOOOAAAAH)

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:40.360
Mike: "Listen, it..."

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:41.740
"...It's come back."

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:42.460
Ben: [gasps]

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:48.660
Ritter says no to his hoe on the go, as he sits atop a tall building and ponders his past about being the new kid.

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:50.340
"Welcome to Derry."

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:51.620
"Thank you, Ms. Douglas."

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:54.120
"Oink, Oink. What a porker."

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:59.120
"Henry Bowers, You will stay for one hour 
after school, every day this week."

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:01.660
"Now, report to the principal's office!"

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:04.100
"You're dead, fat boy."

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:05.860
Nostalgia Critic: Mmmm, THAT I'm going to allow.

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:10.060
Threatening his life is okay, but calling 
him a porker is simply going too far!

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:12.740
So, Ben meets up with a girl named Beverly.

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:16.240
They seem to hit it off pretty good, but 
the chorus from Grease has other ideas.

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:18.280
"I wanna make sure you remember my name."

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:19.960
"I'll remember Henry, I'll remember!"

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:22.160
"How am I gonna make sure, huh?"

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:23.400
Nostalgia Critic: Oh! I almost forgot!

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:28.100
Take a shot for the one-dimensional bullies that have no development or redeemable qualities what-so-ever!

00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:31.820
Silly me, I thought I came across one 
that had SOME form of humanity.

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:34.680
N--

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:41.600
So, he loses the bullies, as he comes across the kids from Stand by Me--I mean his classroom.

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:43.740
And, of course, they become very good friends.

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:46.260
But that doesn't help smooth 
things over with his step family.

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:48.520
"Hey, Ma, listen to this! 
Benny's in love!"

00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:50.000
Ben: "Give this back!"

00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:52.240
"Oww, Ma! Ma!"

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:57.140
Benjamin Hanscom! Stop that
immediately, you young ruffian!

00:05:57.760 --> 00:06:01.040
"I hate you! You're only here cause
 mom says it's our christian duty!"

00:06:01.380 --> 00:06:05.800
Hey, take a shot for a heavy-handed slap 
against conservative fundamentalists.

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:06.680
[loud buzz]

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:07.960
What? That doesn't count?!

00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:11.300
Well, surely there's got to be some 
over-blown whine-fest against Christianity!

00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:12.000
[loud buzz]

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:15.840
Oh, alright. I'll have to read another one 
of your stories to see that religion is evil.

00:06:17.140 --> 00:06:21.500
So Ben comes across some sort of sewer entrance, where the evil clown is waiting for him.

00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:25.160
"Come here son, You'll like it down there!"

00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:27.280
[overlapping voices] "You'll never have to grow up."

00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:28.420
"Daddy?"

00:06:28.420 --> 00:06:31.680
"Yes, my dear. Would I lie?"

00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:37.020
"They float! They all float!"

00:06:38.860 --> 00:06:43.100
So the clown doesn't really... hurt him or anything...

00:06:43.100 --> 00:06:46.000
...he just sort of points at him 
and calls him fat.

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:47.000
What a jerk.

00:06:47.320 --> 00:06:50.520
But we cut to yet another childhood 
friend who gets a call, Beverly.

00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:52.920
Who's hitting the sack with a co-worker in the 90's

00:06:52.920 --> 00:06:56.040
who's so successful that his mullet is almost reaching his knees.

00:06:56.360 --> 00:06:59.100
Beverly: "I got to go to Maine! That was Mike Hanlon on the phone."

00:06:59.340 --> 00:07:02.200
"Remembered to call at work today, 
he's an old, dear friend I have to--"

00:07:02.200 --> 00:07:02.860
[loud slap]

00:07:02.860 --> 00:07:04.060
Oh yeah, I forgot.

00:07:04.060 --> 00:07:09.800
Everybody in a Stephen King story is a JACKASS except for the insecure poet and/or loser.

00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:11.800
I think that calls for another shot.

00:07:14.200 --> 00:07:16.100
[sighs]

00:07:16.100 --> 00:07:17.100
Why are you all spinning?

00:07:17.900 --> 00:07:19.260
"You get into bed--!"

00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:19.780
"No!"

00:07:19.780 --> 00:07:20.580
*Crash*

00:07:20.580 --> 00:07:22.300
Jackass bedmate: "Then maybe you can leave this house in two--"

00:07:22.300 --> 00:07:23.260
Beverly: No!

00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:24.580
"--days, instead of two weeks!"

00:07:24.580 --> 00:07:28.300
"Not ever, ever, ever AGAIN!!"

00:07:31.200 --> 00:07:34.600
"Bev, you need me! BEEEEEEEEV!!"

00:07:34.600 --> 00:07:36.600
[Chuckle] Nice emoting there, guy.

00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:38.180
"BEEEEEEV!!"

00:07:38.180 --> 00:07:39.900
BEEEEEEEEEV!

00:07:40.260 --> 00:07:42.920
Luckily, a cab comes to take her to our next flashback

00:07:42.980 --> 00:07:44.980
where we see that Ben has left a poem for her.

00:07:45.620 --> 00:07:46.360
"What'cha got there?"

00:07:46.360 --> 00:07:46.980
"Nothing!"

00:07:47.300 --> 00:07:48.140
"Let me see that."

00:07:49.240 --> 00:07:51.240
"You've been fooling around with some boy?"

00:07:53.400 --> 00:07:55.400
"Sometimes I worry a lot!"

00:07:55.400 --> 00:07:56.240
"Daddy, please!"

00:07:56.320 --> 00:07:56.960
[loud slap]

00:07:56.960 --> 00:08:01.680
Jeez, no matter what scene this chick is in, she's always getting a slap in the face.

00:08:02.340 --> 00:08:04.640
"YOU GET RIGHT THE HELL BACK HERE, BEVY!"

00:08:04.920 --> 00:08:08.260
"OR BEFORE GOD, I'LL WHIP THE SKIN OFF OF YOU!"

00:08:08.260 --> 00:08:13.080
Oh, of course! Rednecks! Can't forget 
about the rednecks! That calls for a shot!

00:08:15.660 --> 00:08:17.660
[motor stalling sounds]

00:08:18.600 --> 00:08:20.580
So she meets up with Ben and heads over to the--

00:08:20.580 --> 00:08:21.080
[hiccups]

00:08:22.220 --> 00:08:28.260
--And heads over to the rest of the Geeks and Outcasts who pretty much make up the only fucking decent people in this town!

00:08:28.400 --> 00:08:32.920
"It's the River Nile! And four, count them, four Sphinxes."

00:08:33.080 --> 00:08:34.360
"Richie Tozier is my name."

00:08:34.360 --> 00:08:35.000
[buzzing]

00:08:35.220 --> 00:08:37.220
"And doing voices is my game!"

00:08:37.220 --> 00:08:40.780
Hey look, Seth Green is playing a funny geek 
who spends most of his time doing voices.

00:08:42.020 --> 00:08:44.400
I'm... far too tipsy to make a joke out of that.

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:47.700
So the gang gets together and starts making a dam.

00:08:48.240 --> 00:08:52.980
Why? Because it's fucking Maine! 
And by god, that's as exciting as it gets!

00:08:53.260 --> 00:08:58.220
Hell, there's even some famous jerk-off writers who write about it, that's how exciting it is up there!

00:08:58.680 --> 00:09:00.340
So we see Beth and her father back at home and--

00:09:00.340 --> 00:09:01.000
ALCOHOLIC!

00:09:01.160 --> 00:09:02.940
They're always in Stephen King stories, alcoholic!

00:09:06.220 --> 00:09:06.920
So she go--

00:09:08.680 --> 00:09:09.260
[loud thud]

00:09:10.100 --> 00:09:12.100
[slurred] So she goes to the bathroom sink where the

00:09:12.100 --> 00:09:15.940
clown's snot bubble clogs up her drain and gets blood all over the place.

00:09:15.980 --> 00:09:17.820
Just like before, the grown-ups don't see it.

Th' camera's purdy...

00:09:35.420 --> 00:09:38.000
Anyway, cut to the next childhood friend getting a call

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:40.740
which appears to be Andy Dick 
searching for his happy pills.

00:09:41.080 --> 00:09:43.160
"Where are you going?!" 
Andy: "I got to go back to Derry!"

00:09:43.360 --> 00:09:44.340
"Derry?"

00:09:45.240 --> 00:09:48.080
"Why would you want to go 
back to that dirty little town?"

00:09:48.300 --> 00:09:50.880
"There's nothing for you there. There never was, Eddie!"

00:09:51.020 --> 00:09:56.540
Nostalgia Critic: Why is it these people have a talent for surrounding themselves with the craziest fucking nutballs?!

00:09:56.680 --> 00:10:00.180
Is anyone in this world outside 
the main characters likable?!

00:10:00.260 --> 00:10:03.460
What kind of water are they drinking in 
Maine to make them such assholes?

00:10:04.020 --> 00:10:07.300
Insert, here's a big surprise, ANOTHER flashback.

00:10:07.520 --> 00:10:10.740
So we find out that Eddie was the kid with the Inhaler,

00:10:10.740 --> 00:10:13.820
as we see that his mother had 
a tight grip on him even back then.

00:10:13.860 --> 00:10:14.900
Beth: "See you tomorrow, Eddie."

00:10:14.900 --> 00:10:16.900
Mother: "Eddie has to rest tomorrow."

00:10:17.060 --> 00:10:19.880
"I don't want you to play with them anymore, 
no good will come from it!"

00:10:20.060 --> 00:10:21.440
Eddie: "But ma, they're my friends!"

00:10:21.440 --> 00:10:23.780
"You don't need any friends, 
Eddie, except for your ol' ma."

00:10:24.380 --> 00:10:26.380
Think that's bad, you should see his brother.

00:10:26.500 --> 00:10:28.280
[violins screeching]

00:10:28.280 --> 00:10:29.860
[screaming]

00:10:29.920 --> 00:10:33.380
Speaking of shower scenes, 
Eddie gets a doozie from the clown

00:10:33.380 --> 00:10:38.240
as he walks in the shower room and finds out that the showers in the gym, are stretching out...!

00:10:38.600 --> 00:10:40.600
Ummm...Yeah that's about it.

00:10:40.800 --> 00:10:43.500
Kid can leave whenever he wants but doesn't, so...

00:10:44.640 --> 00:10:45.520
...just kind of stupid

00:10:45.740 --> 00:10:49.040
Pennywise: "This is a little inconvenient, Eddie."

00:10:49.380 --> 00:10:52.220
"Just hold on while I make a few adjustments."

00:10:53.940 --> 00:10:56.680
Oh no! He's being attacked by the California Raisins!

00:10:56.680 --> 00:10:58.860
Come on! That stop motion was horrible!

00:10:59.080 --> 00:11:01.080
"Here I am, Wheezy!"

00:11:01.560 --> 00:11:05.200
"Oh come back anytime! Bring your friends!"

00:11:16.460 --> 00:11:17.360
[Train whistle]

00:11:17.500 --> 00:11:19.420
Nostalgia Critic: Uh, then what happened?

00:11:19.700 --> 00:11:22.080
What? You're gonna just stop there? Seriously?

00:11:22.180 --> 00:11:23.900
Come on! Fill us in!

00:11:23.900 --> 00:11:27.020
What? Did he just stare at him 
awkwardly for the rest of the time?

00:11:27.220 --> 00:11:31.760
[Growls and laughs evilly]

00:11:34.840 --> 00:11:37.360

[Looney Tunes theme]

00:11:50.200 --> 00:11:52.900
So we cut to the Seth Green kid all grown up when--

00:11:53.140 --> 00:11:54.820
Oh, hold on. Let me guess.

00:11:54.820 --> 00:11:55.520
[clears throat]

00:11:56.480 --> 00:11:58.280
THE PHONE RINGS AND ANOTHER FLASHBACK HAPPENS!

00:11:58.280 --> 00:12:00.340
[phone rings] 
Mike: "Mike Hanlon from Derry!"

00:12:01.820 --> 00:12:06.100
We see Seth Green chased by the bullies again, 
big shock, and runs into the principal.

00:12:06.320 --> 00:12:09.640
So he's ordered to go downstairs 
and come back up with a mop.

00:12:09.640 --> 00:12:11.100
[Chuckle] Cum...

00:12:11.940 --> 00:12:14.540
But he's afraid because 
he's suddenly attacked by Teen Wolf.

00:12:14.740 --> 00:12:17.400
"HEEELP! HEEELP!"

00:12:17.480 --> 00:12:20.280
Wait. Wait let me guess again. 
[clears throat]

00:12:20.800 --> 00:12:25.000
He turns into a killer clown, talks about his floating fetish, shows off his sharp teeth and then does nothing!

00:12:25.300 --> 00:12:29.880
"I'll show you how to fllloooooooat down here."

00:12:29.880 --> 00:12:34.300
Why doesn't just eat these fucking kids?! 
He's eaten like half the other kids in the neighborhood!

00:12:34.380 --> 00:12:38.120
Why doesn't he just finish them off? 
And what the hell is more important in his time?

00:12:38.300 --> 00:12:40.340
Roar, I got you now, little boy! RAAAA--!

00:12:40.340 --> 00:12:41.700

[Fresh Prince of Bel Air theme song plays]

00:12:47.640 --> 00:12:49.840
Alright, so you heard everybody else's backstory.

00:12:49.840 --> 00:12:53.320
Where the hell does this "Mike" guy who's making all these calls fit in?

00:12:53.460 --> 00:12:56.840
Well, guess what, the answer will be revealed in...

00:13:00.160 --> 00:13:01.700

It turns out Mike was the new kid on the block

00:13:04.920 --> 00:13:08.140
when, of course, he's attacked by the bullies.

00:13:08.360 --> 00:13:11.120
Are these the only fucking bullies in the town!?

00:13:11.200 --> 00:13:14.240
Come on kids, give the 
skinheads across the street a chance!

00:13:14.440 --> 00:13:18.000
They chase him over a fence as...
apparently they're immune to barbwire,

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:20.580
as he comes across the usual gang of rejects.

00:13:21.360 --> 00:13:22.120
[screams in pain]

00:13:22.120 --> 00:13:27.480
So they throw rocks to defend themselves 
as they discover that bullies apparently aren't immune to pain.

00:13:27.560 --> 00:13:30.180
They talk about how they've all seen the killer clown,

00:13:30.180 --> 00:13:33.600
And discover that he MIGHT have 
been around for as long as 200 years.

00:13:33.980 --> 00:13:39.080
This literally gets the picture going as Mike's book comes to life just to make the kids piss their pants again.

00:13:41.220 --> 00:13:42.700

00:14:45.400 --> 00:14:47.160
Oh, blow me if you don't know.

00:14:53.900 --> 00:14:59.760
They find out that Bev is really good with a Slingshot so she's the perfect candidate to shoot SILVER into the monster.

00:14:59.960 --> 00:15:01.000

00:15:01.300 --> 00:15:04.140

Solid silver."

00:15:04.140 --> 00:15:05.740
"That's just stuff in movies!"

00:15:05.760 --> 00:15:07.760
Yeah, that's just stuff in the movies!

00:15:07.840 --> 00:15:11.240
This is a killer clown that can 
turn himself into a werewolf!

00:15:11.240 --> 00:15:13.280
You know. REAL LIFE!

00:15:13.780 --> 00:15:18.660
So they go into the sewer where they think the clown is, as it turns out the bullies are there waiting.

00:15:18.920 --> 00:15:19.720
Generic Bully #2: "Where they going?"

00:15:20.300 --> 00:15:22.040

00:15:26.240 --> 00:15:27.600
"They're not coming back out."

Nostalgia Critic: Did you get that audience? 
Okay, in we go.

00:15:30.200 --> 00:15:33.040
So they go into the sewer to try and fight the monster.

00:15:33.040 --> 00:15:38.000
This is really suspenseful because I have no idea which characters are gonna make it out alive 
except for all of them.

Are you unpoopular? 
[loud thud]

00:16:15.320 --> 00:16:20.000
O..kay! So this bright flashing light 
that's supposed to be the clown, I guess,

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:22.220
comes in and kills two of the bully boys.

00:16:22.320 --> 00:16:26.260
Oh wait, you forgot to scare them for two months 
and brag about how things float!

00:16:26.400 --> 00:16:29.980
Ah well, one kid gets sucked through a pipe
 like Super Mario Brothers,

00:16:29.980 --> 00:16:32.180
and the other kid just turns into Billie Idol.

00:16:32.420 --> 00:16:36.000
Why doesn't he just kill that kid? 
Because he is a very stupid clown.

00:16:36.340 --> 00:16:40.660
Meanwhile the kids hold hands because that 
apparently weakens the monster's power.

00:16:40.660 --> 00:16:42.800
It's like a Care Bears Special, I guess.

00:16:42.860 --> 00:16:47.140

you were afraid of the whole time, guys.

I'm drunk and even I'm not afraid of that.

00:17:06.160 --> 00:17:11.620
So they think they killed it, and make a promise that if he's not dead, they'll come back to finish the job.

00:17:11.820 --> 00:17:15.760
Well, it's years later, the clown is back 
and we find Stan is just a filthy cheater.

00:17:34.640 --> 00:17:37.360
To leave the world's briefest suicide note.

00:17:37.520 --> 00:17:39.900
Did he really feel that would explain everything?

00:17:40.400 --> 00:17:43.900
Oh wait, before I go I should 
probably explain the situation.

00:17:44.560 --> 00:17:45.660
"IT"

00:17:46.860 --> 00:17:48.220
And they can figure out the rest from there.

00:17:51.920 --> 00:17:56.740
So Mike and Bill reunite, as Bill sees just how much has changed and how much has not changed.

00:17:57.660 --> 00:17:58.240
"Yours?"

Ah, it's those wonderful balloons where even though no one can see or feel them it still makes people somehow flinch.

00:18:24.360 --> 00:18:24.860
"If you see--."

00:18:24.860 --> 00:18:26.220

You do? Well, you better let the poor guy out!"

"Waha! Waha! Waha!"

00:18:33.960 --> 00:18:37.920
[laughs] 
Maybe it's because I'm drunk or something but..

00:18:38.620 --> 00:18:39.980
Tim Curry's a riot!

00:18:40.600 --> 00:18:43.980
Were people really scared by this guy? He's hilarious!

00:18:44.080 --> 00:18:46.540
I don't even think his scene is suppose to be this long,

00:18:46.540 --> 00:18:49.660
I think he just decided to stay on set and annoy everybody.

00:18:49.960 --> 00:18:53.100
Richie: "--that I had to go...That I had to get cleaned up!"

00:18:53.340 --> 00:18:56.140
Nostalgia Critic: Uh, Tim? You're done for the day. 
Could you please piss off?"

00:18:56.920 --> 00:18:58.960
"Tell him, I'll see him, tonight!"

00:19:00.180 --> 00:19:03.300
Nostalgia Critic: We have a movie to film here, Tim,
 and you're really not helping.

00:19:04.240 --> 00:19:05.300
Please leave?

00:19:06.240 --> 00:19:08.240
Okay, we'll just shoot around you.

00:19:09.080 --> 00:19:12.740
Don't worry people, he'll get punished. 
He's gonna be in Charlie's Angels soon enough.

00:19:13.100 --> 00:19:17.100
Both Eddie and Beth have similar incidents where the clown pops up and scares them.

00:19:17.100 --> 00:19:19.240
But again, why doesn't he just kill them?

00:19:19.580 --> 00:19:21.240
[ominous music plays]

00:19:21.460 --> 00:19:23.640
Clown: [laughing evilly]

00:19:25.780 --> 00:19:29.460
Boy, they're really banking on 
balloons being scary, aren't they?

00:19:29.520 --> 00:19:31.360
Did they really think that's gonna threaten people?

00:19:31.480 --> 00:19:34.200
If that's the case: Maybe this movie was a stalker film.

00:19:34.660 --> 00:19:38.180
Okay, so they meet up at a Chinese 
restaurant for a nice big reunion.

00:19:38.300 --> 00:19:41.520
While the camera circles around 
the table enough times to make you puke,

00:19:41.520 --> 00:19:44.780
though, to be fair, maybe that's from this 
OBNOXIOUS drinking game,

00:19:44.780 --> 00:19:49.600
we see the only surviving bully is now in a mental institution, where he's transformed into Matt Locke.

00:19:51.340 --> 00:19:52.440
Pennywise: "Up here!"

00:19:53.760 --> 00:19:56.240
"You helped me once, remember?"

00:19:56.720 --> 00:19:58.940
Oh hey, it's a beautiful Tim Curry out tonigh-

00:19:58.940 --> 00:20:00.120
[screams]

00:20:00.120 --> 00:20:07.940
Kill them all. Kill them all. Kill them all.
Kill them all. Kill them all. Kill them all.

00:20:07.940 --> 00:20:13.760
"I'm the shadow on the moon at night, 
filling your dreams to the brim with fright!"

00:20:13.960 --> 00:20:16.740
Meanwhile back at the restaurant, 
we see that the fortune cookies

00:20:16.740 --> 00:20:21.280
have been replaced with Marilyn Manson's windup toys. Which of course scares the living shit out of them.

00:20:21.280 --> 00:20:25.960
This leads them back to the library where they try to figure out "What the heck's keeping Stan so long?"

00:20:26.260 --> 00:20:31.080
"You tell that loser that if he hasn't left already, he's a dead man, we all managed to show up!"

00:20:31.080 --> 00:20:34.480
Richie: "I have never felt so much 
love in one room in my entire life."

00:20:34.480 --> 00:20:38.200
"It's great to be back in Derry,
 breathing in that old "Derry-air."

00:20:38.240 --> 00:20:42.740
Well, they continue to be incredibly inappropriate as we build up to the obvious dramatic payoff in

00:20:42.740 --> 00:20:43.240
3

00:20:43.240 --> 00:20:43.740

1

00:20:44.260 --> 00:20:44.960
"Stan is dead."

00:20:45.100 --> 00:20:46.860
Oh no! We were assholes!

00:20:47.280 --> 00:20:49.540
Well, let's mourn his loss with another flashback.

00:20:49.920 --> 00:20:54.880
Eddie: "He said he didn't mean to go into that house.
But this voice kept...whispering to him."

00:20:57.540 --> 00:20:58.940
[scary music plays]

00:20:58.940 --> 00:21:00.740
[growling]

00:21:00.740 --> 00:21:03.760
Okay, I must really be gone, 
because that looks like a mummy.

00:21:04.280 --> 00:21:06.720
Seriously, we're using mummies now?

00:21:06.720 --> 00:21:10.720
This isn't a Stephen King movie, 
it's a "Abbott and Costello" knockoff!

00:21:12.280 --> 00:21:13.300
"He was trapped..."

00:21:13.360 --> 00:21:17.020
Eddie: "The only thing he could think of to do was to hold his bird book out in front of him like a shield

00:21:17.020 --> 00:21:20.200
and say as loud as he could the names of 
all the birds he could remember."

00:21:22.220 --> 00:21:24.360
Whaaat...?

00:21:25.160 --> 00:21:30.080
"--hold his bird book out in front of him like a shield and say as loud as he could the names of all the birds he could remember."

00:21:31.580 --> 00:21:33.580
Whhyyyyy?

00:21:35.200 --> 00:21:40.780
"Speckled grouse, Baltimore oriole... great egret...heron...woodpecker...brown thrasher."

00:21:41.160 --> 00:21:42.440
Nostalgia Critic: Oh wha--And it worked!?

00:21:42.440 --> 00:21:44.620
What the hell? What sense does that make?!

00:21:44.920 --> 00:21:48.340
What? Are Mummies just 
allergic to the sound of bird's names?

00:21:48.500 --> 00:21:49.780
[demonic voice]

00:21:50.240 --> 00:21:51.380
European Swallow!

00:21:51.380 --> 00:21:52.640
[roaring]

00:21:54.420 --> 00:21:57.380
"I hadn't thought of it until just now, I swear."

00:21:57.380 --> 00:22:02.280
"He said 'I looked into it's deadlights... 
and I wanted to be there".

00:22:02.340 --> 00:22:04.700
Bill: "Deadlights...?"
[eerie music]

00:22:04.920 --> 00:22:08.760
Nostalgia Critic: Okay, what is up with these stupid 
sound effects whenever there's a flashback?

00:22:08.760 --> 00:22:10.560
I mean will any sound effects do?

00:22:10.620 --> 00:22:11.960
I looked into it's deadlights.

00:22:11.960 --> 00:22:13.240
[cartoon drum sound effect]

00:22:13.240 --> 00:22:15.800
You looked into it's deadlights?!
 [victory trumpet]

00:22:15.880 --> 00:22:17.080
I looked into it's deadlights!

00:22:17.080 --> 00:22:19.080
[rooster crows]

00:22:19.400 --> 00:22:22.300
Mike: "I'm sure I got something here.
Anybody else?"

00:22:22.300 --> 00:22:23.440
Beth: "Yeah."

00:22:24.980 --> 00:22:26.140
Nostalgia Critic: Oh my God, MORE BALLOONS!

00:22:26.140 --> 00:22:29.640
More balloons! Hide your family! 
Get down! Balloons aaahhh...!

00:22:29.640 --> 00:22:34.940
Seriously, will you KNOCK IT OFF?! There's balloons everywhere in this picture. They're not frightening!

00:22:35.400 --> 00:22:38.960
I mean, come on! 
When is a balloon ever gonna look intimidating? I--

00:22:40.060 --> 00:22:41.780
[foreboding music plays]

00:22:45.980 --> 00:22:47.980
[frightening crescendo]

00:22:49.240 --> 00:22:49.940
[stifled gasp]

00:22:51.860 --> 00:22:53.860
[eerie decrescendo]

00:23:01.020 --> 00:23:04.380
So the "scary-as-fuck" balloons come 
out as they see Stan's head is inside

00:23:04.520 --> 00:23:06.600
This would be somewhat scary until...

00:23:06.640 --> 00:23:09.040
"Sorry I'm late! Well, let's see who's here!"

00:23:09.300 --> 00:23:12.120
Stan: "Richie, you still here?
We never expected you to stick around."

00:23:12.120 --> 00:23:14.680
"Nice nose job. No one would ever suspect."

00:23:14.800 --> 00:23:17.400
"Haystack! Putting on a little weight, huh?"

00:23:17.400 --> 00:23:19.420
"Wheezy, how's your sex life?"

00:23:19.620 --> 00:23:20.760
"What's your sex life?"

00:23:20.760 --> 00:23:23.740
This is turning into a stand-up 
routine at Jeffrey Dahmer's house!

00:23:24.140 --> 00:23:26.840
[Pennywise taking over Stan's voice] 
"We all float down here, and you will too."

00:23:27.020 --> 00:23:29.440
"They all...FLOAT!!!"

00:23:29.440 --> 00:23:32.900
So I guess they don't find the talking head 
that funny and they get the hell out of there.

00:23:33.160 --> 00:23:36.200
Meanwhile, we see the bully escape 
from the mental hospital by--

00:23:36.860 --> 00:23:38.860
[ominous music plays]

00:23:40.420 --> 00:23:41.220
[barking]

00:23:41.220 --> 00:23:42.380
[screaming]

00:23:42.680 --> 00:23:48.000
[laughing]

00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:50.420
[still laughing] It's the funniest thing I've ever seen in my life...

00:23:50.980 --> 00:23:51.480
Huh?

00:23:52.540 --> 00:23:54.200
It's supposed to be scary?

00:23:55.840 --> 00:24:01.200
No it's not, it's supposed to be funny! 
It's a dog, dressed up as a clown in slow motion. Ny-

00:24:01.720 --> 00:24:02.520
Huh?

00:24:03.500 --> 00:24:05.380
That was really supposed to be scary?

00:24:08.120 --> 00:24:09.360
Well, it's not...

00:24:10.660 --> 00:24:11.380
IT'S NOT!!!

00:24:12.540 --> 00:24:13.420
So after the--

00:24:13.420 --> 00:24:15.720
[Laughs] 
Okay, okay!

00:24:15.720 --> 00:24:21.120
They figure out that the clown attacks
 or "FEEDS" if you will, on people every 30 years.

00:24:21.400 --> 00:24:25.100
Oh, and apparently the whole entire town is in on it too.

00:24:25.140 --> 00:24:26.980
How do they know that? Get this:

00:24:26.980 --> 00:24:32.440
Because when Bev was a girl getting beat up once, 
an old man went back inside.

00:24:33.660 --> 00:24:34.380
Yeah.

00:24:34.380 --> 00:24:39.100
Because that one dick-cheese didn't help her, that apparently means the whole town is crazy.

00:24:39.560 --> 00:24:43.260
Beverly: "I couldn't believe it, he... he just
 turned around and went inside."

00:24:44.080 --> 00:24:45.740
Beverly: "That's when it really hit me."

00:24:45.740 --> 00:24:48.680
"There was something terribly 
wrong in Derry, WITH Derry."

00:24:49.540 --> 00:24:51.120
ISN'T IT OBVIOUS?!

00:24:51.820 --> 00:24:55.880
Well, anyway, Matlock attacks Mike 
but they manage to fight him off and kill him.

00:24:56.180 --> 00:24:59.860
They bring Mike to a hospital 
as Bev starts to analyze the situation.

00:25:00.280 --> 00:25:02.280
"Why is it doing this?"

00:25:02.920 --> 00:25:04.920
"Why does it hate?"

00:25:04.920 --> 00:25:06.920
"Why is it...so mean?"

00:25:07.300 --> 00:25:11.640
You would think that a psychotic, 
killing clown would be a little nicer!

00:25:12.200 --> 00:25:14.400
"How could I be so blind?"

00:25:14.540 --> 00:25:18.440
Ben: "If you see it now, you're not blind anymore, Bev."

00:25:22.120 --> 00:25:24.440
Nostalgia Critic: Boy, this chick really gets around, doesn't she?

00:25:24.500 --> 00:25:28.260
I mean, I think she's literally felt up
 every single person in this group.

00:25:28.260 --> 00:25:32.120
I can see why they hung out with her,
 she's easier to get into than an art college!

00:25:32.240 --> 00:25:34.240
Mike: "Be careful, you can't trust anyone."

00:25:35.180 --> 00:25:39.600
"If anybody asks, party got out of hand, dancing on a table and you took a fall"

00:25:41.240 --> 00:25:43.240
"Anyone who's seen me dance will buy that."

00:25:43.480 --> 00:25:47.940
Nostalgia Critic: Well that's great. And how are you going to explain the DEAD, ESCAPED MENTAL PATIENT?!

00:25:48.180 --> 00:25:51.960
You're not seriously suggesting you
 walk out of here and leave him lying there?

00:25:51.960 --> 00:25:55.320
"You're not seriously suggesting we 
walk out of here and leave him lying there?"

00:25:55.320 --> 00:25:56.520
Bill: "Yeah, that's what I'm suggesting."

00:25:56.660 --> 00:25:58.680
[loud slap]
WHY DON'T YOU CALL THE POLICE?!

00:25:58.840 --> 00:26:01.360
"This whole town is 'It' in someway, all of them!"

00:26:01.920 --> 00:26:03.920
[eerie music begins]

00:26:04.680 --> 00:26:05.640
"Bill's right."

00:26:05.880 --> 00:26:12.120
Really?! We're still on this?! Because one old fart went in and jerked off that means the entire town is crazy?!

00:26:12.720 --> 00:26:13.860
Here's an idea!

00:26:14.180 --> 00:26:15.860
You're all seeing killer clowns...

00:26:16.340 --> 00:26:17.740
Maybe YOU'RE crazy!

00:26:18.160 --> 00:26:21.460
Did that ever occur to you, 
you crazy sacks of crazy CRAZY?!

00:26:22.340 --> 00:26:26.680
So they all decide to go back into the 
sewer and kill this thing once and for all.

00:26:26.680 --> 00:26:29.120
So what kind of weapons are they bringing, you think?

00:26:29.300 --> 00:26:33.180
"I don't suppose anybody thought to
 bring anything really useful, like a machine gun?"

00:26:33.180 --> 00:26:35.880
Bev: "I brought this.
 It's the only thing I saved from those days."

00:26:35.880 --> 00:26:38.580
Oh, that's great, they're bringing a slingshot!

00:26:38.580 --> 00:26:41.360
They can either bring a MACHINE GUN, or a SLINGSHOT.

00:26:41.360 --> 00:26:43.860
RAMBO, or DENNIS THE MENACE.

00:26:45.300 --> 00:26:47.840
You're going down Mr. Wilson! PEW! PEW! PEW!

00:26:47.840 --> 00:26:52.180
Richie: "Oh, come on, guys! 
What the hell are you gonna do now, sing Kumbaya?"

00:26:52.760 --> 00:26:54.700
"Wake up! Take a breath."

00:26:55.400 --> 00:26:57.400
"You smell that? That's death!"

00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:00.000
You hear the wind? That's death!

00:27:00.320 --> 00:27:02.320
You feel the ground? That's death!

00:27:02.360 --> 00:27:05.700
You feel the inching in the back of your head?! 
That's probably a mosquito.

00:27:07.020 --> 00:27:08.600
Mosquito of DEATH!

00:27:09.140 --> 00:27:14.520
So they make their way down to the retired Star Trek set, where Bill's wife happens to be trapped in the cave.

00:27:14.560 --> 00:27:18.680
Yeah, apparently she was heading to Maine 
to bring her husband back and the clown got her.

00:27:18.680 --> 00:27:23.040
...which is POINTLESS seeing 
how he can take on any form, but I digress.

00:27:23.340 --> 00:27:27.820
As they get the the heart of the sewer, they finally see the monster for what he really is.

00:27:28.260 --> 00:27:31.420
[ominous music plays]

00:27:32.580 --> 00:27:35.280
Nostalgia Critic: What...?
Whaaaaat!?

00:27:35.700 --> 00:27:37.920
[studders]

00:27:38.420 --> 00:27:39.280
WHAT?

00:27:39.860 --> 00:27:43.460
Nostalgia Critic: We waited THREE FUCKING HOURS 
for THAT?!

00:27:43.740 --> 00:27:45.820
You can't be serious! YOU CAN'T BE SERIOUS!!

00:27:46.060 --> 00:27:51.440
If I heard that a movie called "It" was just 
building up to a big, silly monster,

00:27:51.440 --> 00:27:53.820
I THINK THIS WOULD HAVE BEEN A BETTER PAY OFF!!

00:27:54.180 --> 00:27:56.380
I mean, seriously? Seriously?!

00:27:56.640 --> 00:28:00.420
My god...So you're telling me this whole fucking time,

00:28:00.640 --> 00:28:01.700
we were building up to---

00:28:01.700 --> 00:28:03.700
[rumbling]

00:28:03.760 --> 00:28:06.840
SPIDERS! A giant legion of spiders!

00:28:06.840 --> 00:28:08.060
GOD DAMN IT, DOCTOR SMITH!

00:28:08.060 --> 00:28:11.180
This is really what you and 
Stephen King find frightening?!

00:28:11.180 --> 00:28:11.680
YES!

00:28:11.680 --> 00:28:13.560
My dream is finally realized! I--

00:28:13.560 --> 00:28:14.780
[sniffing]

00:28:14.780 --> 00:28:16.780
What smells like urinated whiskey?

00:28:17.040 --> 00:28:20.220
Oh, it's me I've been playing 
the Stephen King Drinking Game.

00:28:20.220 --> 00:28:22.540
Oh, good God, man! 
That's been known to kill people!

00:28:22.540 --> 00:28:26.380
[slurred] Hey...You know what else has 
been known to kill people?

00:28:26.380 --> 00:28:28.520
I'll tell you...THIS!

00:28:28.520 --> 00:28:29.020
[loud bang]

00:28:29.020 --> 00:28:30.840
That's right. HOLD STILL! 
[loud bang]

00:28:30.840 --> 00:28:33.760
Hold still! I'm gonna shoot all five of you!

00:28:33.760 --> 00:28:34.260
[loud bang]

00:28:34.260 --> 00:28:36.260
YOU'RE GOING DOWN SPIDERMAN! [loud bang]

00:28:36.260 --> 00:28:39.160
Not the super hero the....the YOU!

00:28:39.280 --> 00:28:39.780
[loud bang]

00:28:39.780 --> 00:28:42.360
I'll just show myself out.

00:28:42.360 --> 00:28:44.360
[loud bang]

00:28:44.360 --> 00:28:45.980
Yeah, you BETTER run...

00:28:46.400 --> 00:28:51.840
So yeah, they're fighting a giant spider, an unbelievably fake looking one too.

00:28:51.840 --> 00:28:55.580
They all start getting sucked into it's "deadlights" until Eddie has an idea.

00:28:55.580 --> 00:28:59.800
"This is battery acid... Now you disappear!"

00:29:00.180 --> 00:29:01.740
[roaring]

00:29:01.740 --> 00:29:02.600
[Eddie screaming]

00:29:02.600 --> 00:29:07.100
Nostalgia Critic: Well, that was a stupid idea, guy. Maybe that "machine gun" theory would have worked after all!

00:29:07.100 --> 00:29:08.680
[screaming]

00:29:08.820 --> 00:29:13.860
So Eddie gets killed, but luckily Bev shoots it in the glowing ball sack, that seems to kill it.

00:29:14.160 --> 00:29:18.060
Oh wait. No, sorry. They tip it over like a cow first 
and then they rip its heart out.

00:29:18.300 --> 00:29:20.300
Truly, this was a battle of wits.

00:29:20.500 --> 00:29:24.520
So they all go back home 
to their normal selves, except for Bill's wife.

00:29:24.720 --> 00:29:28.460
who seems to be in a zombie-like 
state because of the giant spider.

00:29:28.780 --> 00:29:31.860
But somehow riding downhill 
on a bike seems to make her better.

00:29:32.080 --> 00:29:34.080
[triumphant music plays]

00:29:36.940 --> 00:29:41.740
So yeah. The character that had like two scenes, a few lines of dialogue, and barely any presence,

00:29:42.120 --> 00:29:43.180
She's gonna be okay.

00:29:43.220 --> 00:29:47.420
Yeah, I know you were all on the edge of your seats about that, but yeah, she's gonna be okay now!

00:29:47.860 --> 00:29:50.180
So, of course, all that buildup leads to an

00:29:50.180 --> 00:29:54.360
unbelievable let down, 
which is the ultimate staple of Stephen King,

00:29:54.360 --> 00:29:56.980
which means, that gives us our very last shot!

00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:00.940
THIS MOVIE SUCKS!

00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:06.740
I mean the stuff with the kids is tolerable because the kids themselves are actually pretty good actors,

00:30:06.740 --> 00:30:09.020
And, of course, Tim Curry's a lot of fun, but

00:30:09.280 --> 00:30:11.360
half the adults are just terrible!

00:30:11.500 --> 00:30:14.620
The plot makes no sense, it's melodramatic as hell,

00:30:14.720 --> 00:30:20.700
and it all suffers from the Stephen King stereotypes we've seen a bajillion times before! And plus...

00:30:20.700 --> 00:30:22.800
WHAT'S WITH ALL THE BALLOONS?!

00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:27.180
They're not scary! Why do they keep thinking they're scary? What, were they high?

00:30:27.320 --> 00:30:31.260
I mean, seriously. Who in their right mind would ever think a balloon is sca--

00:30:32.400 --> 00:30:34.660
[threatening music plays]

00:30:44.820 --> 00:30:45.760
[knocking]

00:30:45.760 --> 00:30:48.460
Hey, Critic, I got a new script here, 
tell me what you think.

00:30:48.820 --> 00:30:50.820
[silence]

00:30:53.220 --> 00:30:55.720
[suspenseful music plays]

00:31:25.500 --> 00:31:27.500
[screaming sound clip]

00:31:30.380 --> 00:31:32.380
[carnival music plays]

00:31:44.020 --> 00:31:46.020
Bev: "Why is it so mean!?"
