Anyone's pissed off with politics at the moment.
Try It yourself back.

2
00:00:02.761 --> 00:00:05.820
If you're gonna look at politics from any time back in history,

3
00:00:05.821 --> 00:00:08.190
it's always been hell.
It's always been rubbish.

4
00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:11.310
It's always been all over the place.
Yeah.
And uh,

5
00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:17.920
I think um,
transparency as opposed to opacity,

6
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.010
if that's the word.
You know,
the more transparent things are,

7
00:00:20.011 --> 00:00:22.520
the more you can check,
hey that guy's lying about that.
You know,

8
00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:24.930
if we could work out what's the lion,
what's another lie?

9
00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:26.520
That would be really nice.

10
00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:29.310
I didn't know if we could have lights at detected on all the time.

11
00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:33.360
Do I think it's going to be mine?
Reading mind reading?

12
00:00:33.361 --> 00:00:38.100
Well I really think that we're going to have technology within the next 50 years

13
00:00:38.101 --> 00:00:41.610
that allows people to definitively understand whether or not someone's being

14
00:00:41.611 --> 00:00:45.020
honest.
That would,
it would make it,
um,
I,

15
00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:47.970
I'm sure someone could get a bad side of that,
but it's shoring up front.

16
00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:49.630
You think there's a lot of good stuff on that.
Yeah.

17
00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:52.170
Someone could say this is going to happen though.
I want this to happen.

18
00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:56.640
A lot of people,
scams are going to fall apart.
What do you call them?

19
00:00:56.641 --> 00:01:00.630
Ponzi schemes.
Ponzi schemes.
Pyramid schemes.
Yeah.
A lot of that.

20
00:01:00.631 --> 00:01:04.620
It's going to fall apart.
Why they called Ponzi schemes?
Ponzi?
Yeah,
I think so.

21
00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:06.000
I think you can.
There's like a,

22
00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.940
there's a bunch of those little terms like fit gazey.
Jeff Ponzi,

23
00:01:08.941 --> 00:01:12.030
I think for Gazy is one that people use for fake.
It was a,

24
00:01:12.031 --> 00:01:16.290
there was a limousine company that was writing bad checks for gazy limousine

25
00:01:16.291 --> 00:01:19.350
service and it became like a thing on the east coast where,
Oh,
this guy is a,

26
00:01:19.351 --> 00:01:24.350
he's a fucking lazy cop.
Let means you're a fake cop.
Yeah.
Wow.
Yeah.
For gays,

27
00:01:24.351 --> 00:01:28.020
he became a big word.
Charles Policy.
Then Jeff Palsy,
dirt bag.

28
00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:32.880
Look at him either.
He's happy.
He's 20 he's about to leave.
I put over there.

29
00:01:32.881 --> 00:01:36.180
Gentleman walking.
Go roaring twenties just wrapping paper.
Love.

30
00:01:36.181 --> 00:01:37.620
Do we tell people as you're listening,

31
00:01:37.621 --> 00:01:41.610
please look up Charles Ponzi on Wikipedia and

32
00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:46.380
yeah,
so that's it.
And how did he die?
Did they explode?

33
00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:50.640
Hopefully get hit by a meteor.
It'd be nice.
