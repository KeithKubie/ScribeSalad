tell individuals apart and so what we've

tell individuals apart and so what we've
 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.270
tell individuals apart and so what we've
been doing for the last 25 years is the

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:00.280
been doing for the last 25 years is the
 

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:02.190

we kind of put a band on a penguin so

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:04.870
we kind of put a band on a penguin so
 

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:07.710
we kind of put a band on a penguin so
this is what a band looks like and we

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:07.720
this is what a band looks like and we
 

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:09.600
this is what a band looks like and we
actually put it on the left flipper so

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:09.610
actually put it on the left flipper so
 

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:11.880
actually put it on the left flipper so
it's a little like wearing a bracelet or

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:11.890
it's a little like wearing a bracelet or
 

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:14.250
it's a little like wearing a bracelet or
something like that and so we can tell

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:14.260
something like that and so we can tell
 

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:16.320
something like that and so we can tell
the individuals apart what we're trying

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:16.330
the individuals apart what we're trying
 

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:19.110

let the penguin identify themselves and

we're doing this by putting a little

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:24.040
we're doing this by putting a little
 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:27.510
we're doing this by putting a little
tiny tag in their foot and then that's

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:27.520
tiny tag in their foot and then that's
 

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:29.010
tiny tag in their foot and then that's
like a barcode that you'd put in your
