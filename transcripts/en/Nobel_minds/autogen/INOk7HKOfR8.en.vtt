from Stockholm I was walking in the

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439
from Stockholm I was walking in the
 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:28.189
from Stockholm I was walking in the
street with my wife get ready to get

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199
street with my wife get ready to get
 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:33.200
street with my wife get ready to get
back home and I just caught by writer

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210
back home and I just caught by writer
 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:37.190
back home and I just caught by writer
for my poor America phone what was your

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200
for my poor America phone what was your
 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.709
for my poor America phone what was your
first thoughts on receiving the car my

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719
first thoughts on receiving the car my
 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:41.930
first thoughts on receiving the car my
first thought was amazement you know I

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940
first thought was amazement you know I
 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:44.450
first thought was amazement you know I
re like I think I had a thought even

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460
re like I think I had a thought even
 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:46.279
re like I think I had a thought even
before I caught the phone because I saw

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289
before I caught the phone because I saw
 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:51.560
before I caught the phone because I saw
the code 46 or Sweden and so I knew the

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570
the code 46 or Sweden and so I knew the
 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:55.010
the code 46 or Sweden and so I knew the
price was giving it today so I could not

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020
price was giving it today so I could not
 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:57.350
price was giving it today so I could not
believe it with the stop was my first

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360
believe it with the stop was my first
 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:00.470
believe it with the stop was my first
reaction I was really amazed and of

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480
reaction I was really amazed and of
 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.000
reaction I was really amazed and of
course it's wonderful and then I learned

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010
course it's wonderful and then I learned
 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:05.359
course it's wonderful and then I learned
about it and and it's starting to sink

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369
about it and and it's starting to sink
 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:08.660
about it and and it's starting to sink
in it's very take some time because

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670
in it's very take some time because
 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:11.420
in it's very take some time because
immediately after that I I was swamped

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430
immediately after that I I was swamped
 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.100
immediately after that I I was swamped
with phone calls from all over the world

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110
with phone calls from all over the world
 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:15.530

about it that you trap photons and he

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890
about it that you trap photons and he
 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:00.139
about it that you trap photons and he
traps at Adam exactly exactly and and i

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149
traps at Adam exactly exactly and and i
 

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:02.810

use atoms to study photons and he use

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820
use atoms to study photons and he use
 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:04.520
use atoms to study photons and he use
photos to study atoms so it's very

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530
photos to study atoms so it's very
 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:07.370
photos to study atoms so it's very
symmetric or under and at some point you

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380
symmetric or under and at some point you
 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:10.130
symmetric or under and at some point you

never more than three people and so it's

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:47.100
never more than three people and so it's
 

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:49.580
never more than three people and so it's
very difficult to share it but I want to

because we spoke to him earlier and he

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:00.900
because we spoke to him earlier and he
 

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:02.750
because we spoke to him earlier and he
did express exactly the same feeling

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:02.760
did express exactly the same feeling
 

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:05.440
did express exactly the same feeling
that it was all and I did not fear his

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:05.450
that it was all and I did not fear his
 

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:09.470

my assistant to CEO balloon told me that

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:09.480
my assistant to CEO balloon told me that
 

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:10.910
my assistant to CEO balloon told me that
you had already interviewed him but I

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:10.920
you had already interviewed him but I
 

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:12.320
you had already interviewed him but I
did not have a chance to hear he didn't

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:12.330
did not have a chance to hear he didn't
 

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:17.870
did not have a chance to hear he didn't
tell you and it does seem quite amazing

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:17.880
tell you and it does seem quite amazing
 

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:20.510
tell you and it does seem quite amazing
to think that in your laboratory you

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:20.520
to think that in your laboratory you
 

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:23.240
to think that in your laboratory you
arrange meetings between single photons

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:23.250
arrange meetings between single photons
 

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:26.780
arrange meetings between single photons
and single atoms yes we are doing that

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:26.790
and single atoms yes we are doing that
 

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:29.750
and single atoms yes we are doing that
kind of experiment and for a very long

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:29.760
kind of experiment and for a very long
 

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:31.850
kind of experiment and for a very long
time people who are working with huge

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:31.860
time people who are working with huge
 

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:33.890

when you work with big and sandals the

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:37.320
when you work with big and sandals the
 

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:39.590
when you work with big and sandals the
quantum properties are so to speak day

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:39.600
quantum properties are so to speak day
 

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:41.690
quantum properties are so to speak day
they are there hidden because of

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:41.700
they are there hidden because of
 

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:43.340
they are there hidden because of
statistical effects and if you work with

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:43.350
statistical effects and if you work with
 

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:45.860
statistical effects and if you work with
single particles as we do then you can

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:45.870
single particles as we do then you can
 

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:48.350
single particles as we do then you can
reveal the quantum effects in a very

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:48.360
reveal the quantum effects in a very
 

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:51.140
reveal the quantum effects in a very
dramatic way and you can learn about

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:51.150
dramatic way and you can learn about
 

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:53.420
dramatic way and you can learn about
these quantum processes and that's what

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:53.430
these quantum processes and that's what
 

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:55.190
these quantum processes and that's what
we are trying to do how long did it take

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:55.200
we are trying to do how long did it take
 

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:57.020
we are trying to do how long did it take
to build the apparatus to allow you to

00:03:57.020 --> 00:03:57.030
to build the apparatus to allow you to
 

00:03:57.030 --> 00:04:00.350
to build the apparatus to allow you to
do this I took a long time with the idea

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:00.360
do this I took a long time with the idea
 

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:03.410
do this I took a long time with the idea
which gave rise to the price started

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:03.420
which gave rise to the price started
 

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:06.740
which gave rise to the price started
about I would say more than 20 years ago

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:06.750
about I would say more than 20 years ago
 

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:09.200
about I would say more than 20 years ago
in all that and I'm sure the same in day

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:09.210
in all that and I'm sure the same in day
 

00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:11.780
in all that and I'm sure the same in day
when they were moves up and it took us

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:11.790
when they were moves up and it took us
 

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:14.210
when they were moves up and it took us
many years to build the apparatus into

00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:14.220
many years to build the apparatus into
 

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:16.910
many years to build the apparatus into
and to improve it to the point that we

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:16.920
and to improve it to the point that we
 

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:18.860
and to improve it to the point that we
were able to trap the photons for such a

00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:18.870
were able to trap the photons for such a
 

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:20.840
were able to trap the photons for such a
long time so it's a very long-term

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:20.850
long time so it's a very long-term
 

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:24.440
long time so it's a very long-term
project and then I am glad that I was

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:24.450
project and then I am glad that I was
 

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:26.420
project and then I am glad that I was
working in an environment which allows

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:26.430

will be some applications and but
 

00:05:59.319 --> 00:06:01.260
will be some applications and but
whether this application would be for

can be used to detect single photons so

00:06:43.420 --> 00:06:43.430
can be used to detect single photons so
 

00:06:43.430 --> 00:06:45.370
can be used to detect single photons so
again there is some kind of connection

00:06:45.370 --> 00:06:45.380
again there is some kind of connection
 

00:06:45.380 --> 00:06:47.950
again there is some kind of connection
