00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:03.490
We're just learing about truthy and falsey values.

00:00:03.490 --> 00:00:06.060
Let's apply that to what we know about arrays.

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:09.520
Is the length of an array equal to the last index?

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:11.340
Mark yes or no here.

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:13.560
&gt;&gt; And, to find the length of an array,

00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:16.660
simply add .length to the end of the array name
