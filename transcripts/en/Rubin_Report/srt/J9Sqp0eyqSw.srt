1
00:00:00,070 --> 00:00:03,420
[inaudible].

2
00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:07,840
All right, so we touched on the first
amendment a little bit in the first half,

3
00:00:08,110 --> 00:00:11,920
but I think there's also just
a fundamental misunderstanding
about what speech

4
00:00:11,950 --> 00:00:15,820
is related to the First Amendment in that
the first amendment basically is about

5
00:00:15,821 --> 00:00:18,220
what the government is not allowed to do.

6
00:00:18,221 --> 00:00:22,660
And people have now extrapolated that to
think it means what everyone can't do.

7
00:00:22,690 --> 00:00:26,680
Can you talk to, is that famous
xkcd comment comic about, uh,

8
00:00:26,950 --> 00:00:29,260
people have the right to tell you
you're an asshole on the internet and it

9
00:00:29,261 --> 00:00:31,210
doesn't violate the first amendment.
And that's true,

10
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:35,040
although I see it all
day long, I get, yes,

11
00:00:35,970 --> 00:00:39,520
I get that comic thrown at me sometimes
even when it's a government institution

12
00:00:39,521 --> 00:00:42,270
doing the censorship. So it's,
it's overused a little bit too.

13
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:45,310
And that Kinda just gets
in my craw a little bit.

14
00:00:45,311 --> 00:00:49,990
But the first amendment really only does
protect you from the government and it

15
00:00:49,991 --> 00:00:52,870
doesn't just protect you from Congress
and protects you from the states and

16
00:00:52,871 --> 00:00:55,150
protects you from the mis municipalities.

17
00:00:55,150 --> 00:00:57,850
It protects you from the public
colleges and universities and their

18
00:00:57,851 --> 00:00:59,200
administrators.
Um,

19
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:03,340
those are all state actors for the First
Amendment when it doesn't protect you

20
00:01:03,341 --> 00:01:05,780
against is your private employer.
Um,

21
00:01:06,010 --> 00:01:09,730
which means that I could well be fired
for anything I say on this show today.

22
00:01:10,190 --> 00:01:14,500
I'll see what I can do. Um, not to
give you an idea is yeah. Uh, you know,

23
00:01:14,770 --> 00:01:17,540
your parents don't, uh, if you say,

24
00:01:18,010 --> 00:01:21,400
I remember her saying free speech to my
parents and I was very young probably

25
00:01:21,401 --> 00:01:25,410
right after I read it about the Skokie
case and my mother giving me a side eye

26
00:01:25,411 --> 00:01:30,310
either probably burn a hole
through my skull at this point. Um,

27
00:01:31,210 --> 00:01:33,370
but you know, it only protects
you against the government.

28
00:01:33,371 --> 00:01:37,090
It doesn't protect you from criticism of
your peers and your contemporaries and

29
00:01:37,091 --> 00:01:37,930
it shouldn't,
you know,

30
00:01:37,931 --> 00:01:42,640
that's kind of part and parcel of having
the public conversation is if you have

31
00:01:42,641 --> 00:01:44,890
a bad idea and you're
out there spouting it,

32
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:49,570
we all have the right to tell you you
got a shitty idea and we should say that

33
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:54,190
because otherwise, well we might
see that shitty idea spreading.

34
00:01:54,250 --> 00:01:56,440
And that's kind of the point of,

35
00:01:56,470 --> 00:01:59,740
like we were talking about earlier about
letting these terrible ideas out there

36
00:01:59,741 --> 00:02:02,680
is so that we can stand
up and defeat them. Yeah.

37
00:02:02,890 --> 00:02:07,890
Are you seeing any major threats right
now from the government related to free

38
00:02:08,141 --> 00:02:10,480
speech? Because a lot of times
I'll see people saying, well,

39
00:02:10,481 --> 00:02:13,630
Trump is attacking this, or you
know, he texts journalism a lot now.

40
00:02:13,810 --> 00:02:16,720
It's no secret what my feeling about
the mainstream media is these days.

41
00:02:16,721 --> 00:02:20,200
I mean I think it's largely
just partisan garbage.

42
00:02:20,410 --> 00:02:23,740
I don't think you should be killing these
people are harming these people in any

43
00:02:23,741 --> 00:02:25,240
way.
Just to be very clear,

44
00:02:25,450 --> 00:02:29,470
I hope that by by mocking them
and exposing their nonsense,

45
00:02:29,471 --> 00:02:33,490
we'll get a new generation of better
journalists and people who really live to

46
00:02:33,491 --> 00:02:35,650
the code of trying to find
truth and all of that.

47
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:39,280
But do you see a direct threat right
now coming from the government,

48
00:02:39,460 --> 00:02:43,150
either from Trump or or elsewhere? There's
always a direct threat yet. I mean,

49
00:02:43,151 --> 00:02:47,680
let's be clear.
People in power will always,

50
00:02:47,681 --> 00:02:50,740
if given the opportunity,
silence their opponents,

51
00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:53,470
they will preserve the status quo.
And it's not just people in power.

52
00:02:53,471 --> 00:02:58,471
It is an entirely human reaction to want
to censor the people we disagree with.

53
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:02,740
We think we have terrible ideas.

54
00:03:02,770 --> 00:03:06,400
That's kind of a baser
instincts that we all have. Now.

55
00:03:06,401 --> 00:03:11,010
We have to overcome that and understand
the value of, of not doing that, but it's,

56
00:03:11,011 --> 00:03:14,770
it's kind of understandable and weight
and that's why we have to be so vigilant

57
00:03:14,771 --> 00:03:19,000
in protecting free speech
because once the tools are there,

58
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:20,560
they don't go away.

59
00:03:20,620 --> 00:03:25,540
And we've seen this throughout history
and they are wielded and people laughed

60
00:03:25,541 --> 00:03:29,840
at me when I was talking during the
election cycle to I guess kind of betray

61
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:32,740
some of my personal political
beliefs. Then, you know,

62
00:03:32,741 --> 00:03:37,741
I was kind of talking about how the
executive branch overreach as many people

63
00:03:37,751 --> 00:03:41,590
did of the last administration
was problematic because you know,

64
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:43,870
what about the next
guy who comes to power?

65
00:03:43,870 --> 00:03:48,720
Maybe he's going to do something crazy
and nobody, they all laughed at me. Hey,

66
00:03:48,970 --> 00:03:52,060
I was talking about that then I was
talking about it when Bush was doing it.

67
00:03:52,061 --> 00:03:55,810
I was talking about it when Obama was
doing it, and I tell you, he laughed.

68
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:58,810
And then Donald J.
Trump was elected president.

69
00:03:59,590 --> 00:04:03,940
And I looked at them and I said,
what now?

70
00:04:04,450 --> 00:04:08,380
Uh, and you know, you, you said, oh,
it couldn't be possible that somebody,

71
00:04:08,381 --> 00:04:13,000
we disagree with all that much who we
think is really terrible would ever get

72
00:04:13,001 --> 00:04:13,930
elected president.

73
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:18,190
And when they started melting
down over the election,

74
00:04:18,580 --> 00:04:20,770
I looked at them and I said,
told yourself,

75
00:04:21,130 --> 00:04:24,820
you can't be forwarded if executive
actions when it's the guy you like,

76
00:04:24,821 --> 00:04:27,070
but then not for them when
it's the guy you don't like,

77
00:04:27,071 --> 00:04:30,550
of course they're all going to do it
if you give them the power to do it.

78
00:04:30,580 --> 00:04:32,350
And it's the same thing with free speech.

79
00:04:32,380 --> 00:04:37,380
And I think what's really important
to remember is that those mechanisms,

80
00:04:38,171 --> 00:04:43,171
there's tools of censorship are never
ever going to run down to the benefit of

81
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:49,420
the marginalized communities that people
are oftentimes seeking to protect.

82
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:51,220
It just doesn't happen.

83
00:04:51,460 --> 00:04:56,080
The reason that I'm marginalized is
that they don't have political power.

84
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:59,620
They're not going to be the
ones implementing these rules.

85
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:03,790
And that's incredibly problematic
and people don't understand that very

86
00:05:03,791 --> 00:05:08,680
practical reality that those tools of
censorship are going to be used to defend

87
00:05:08,681 --> 00:05:11,920
the status quo, which is what
these people are trying to disrupt.

88
00:05:12,460 --> 00:05:14,320
And disruption is kind of the,

89
00:05:14,321 --> 00:05:18,490
just the major threat that
everyone in power fields.

90
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:21,220
And we've seen it throughout history,

91
00:05:21,221 --> 00:05:23,620
that they're in the civil rights movement.

92
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:28,240
When protestors were arrested for sitting
at lunch counters or for engaging in

93
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:29,650
nonviolent protest,

94
00:05:29,651 --> 00:05:33,250
but were arrested for disorderly
conduct because people reacted to their

95
00:05:33,251 --> 00:05:36,760
protests in violent ways because
there were violent Vicodin thugs.

96
00:05:38,290 --> 00:05:43,290
They were only exonerated
because of the first amendment.

97
00:05:43,390 --> 00:05:47,200
And it took going to the supreme court.
And it's really important to remember,

98
00:05:47,201 --> 00:05:52,201
I mean how many LGBT artists and authors
and publications faced censorship and

99
00:05:53,590 --> 00:05:58,590
had their materials deemed obscenity
at times and not even sent through the

100
00:05:58,701 --> 00:06:02,000
mail. You know, sometimes before you know,

101
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:06,860
food and preventing them from integrating
into the national consciousness.

102
00:06:06,861 --> 00:06:09,590
I mean it's, it's
really, really important.

103
00:06:10,190 --> 00:06:15,190
So is there something happening right
now via the government that you think

104
00:06:15,380 --> 00:06:19,000
shouldn't be happening? I get
the broad sense, sort of the,

105
00:06:19,010 --> 00:06:20,630
the blue sky version of this that yes,

106
00:06:20,631 --> 00:06:23,330
people in power always are going to want
to maintain power and do what they have

107
00:06:23,331 --> 00:06:25,220
to do to silence people,

108
00:06:25,221 --> 00:06:28,010
etc. But at the college and
university level specifically,

109
00:06:28,011 --> 00:06:31,420
I think a lot of it is coming from um,

110
00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:33,930
the Department of Justice.
Uh,

111
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:38,450
and the office for civil rights of the
Department of Education a few years back

112
00:06:38,830 --> 00:06:43,830
had an agreement that they
called a blueprint for
sexual harassment policies at

113
00:06:44,481 --> 00:06:45,650
colleges and universities.

114
00:06:45,650 --> 00:06:49,820
And it basically defines sexual harassment
is any unwelcome conduct of a sexual

115
00:06:49,821 --> 00:06:54,740
nature, including verbal conduct,
which we also know as speech. Yeah.

116
00:06:55,370 --> 00:06:56,203
And

117
00:06:57,650 --> 00:07:02,650
the breathtaking broadness of that policy
really kind of spread like wildfire.

118
00:07:05,140 --> 00:07:06,170
Um,
and you know,

119
00:07:06,260 --> 00:07:10,040
these harassment policies have always
kind of been problematic at times.

120
00:07:10,070 --> 00:07:14,030
This is directly tied to
title nine, right? Yes. Yeah.
Okay. And you know, it's,

121
00:07:14,150 --> 00:07:18,290
it's one of the, I don't know if
it's even an unintended consequence.

122
00:07:18,291 --> 00:07:23,080
It might be a very well
unintended consequence, but
you start seeing things at,

123
00:07:23,081 --> 00:07:25,190
for example,
just the number of years back,

124
00:07:25,310 --> 00:07:30,260
there was a student at the University of
Oregon who was sitting on the ledge in

125
00:07:30,261 --> 00:07:35,261
a dorm room window and she saw a couple
outside and as a joke she shouted,

126
00:07:36,051 --> 00:07:37,160
I hit it first,

127
00:07:37,460 --> 00:07:41,420
which I didn't even know what that meant
when it first came in and I had to look

128
00:07:41,421 --> 00:07:44,600
it up and realize that
it was about Rayjay. Uh,

129
00:07:45,170 --> 00:07:47,570
having sex with Kim Kardashian and Kanye.

130
00:07:47,660 --> 00:07:50,560
I guess that's a thing people care
about nowadays. I don't know, you know,

131
00:07:50,570 --> 00:07:54,550
behind the, he is the leader of the
free speech movement now. So boy,

132
00:07:54,590 --> 00:07:58,370
maybe I do need to find another job.
But anyways,

133
00:07:58,700 --> 00:08:03,700
that the couple was offended and ran
upstairs and talk to the Ra and this

134
00:08:04,101 --> 00:08:09,080
student was hit with several disciplinary
charges including sexual harassment.

135
00:08:09,580 --> 00:08:11,720
First just shouting.
I hit it first.

136
00:08:12,170 --> 00:08:17,170
And this is because of the latitude
that these laws gave colleges too.

137
00:08:18,110 --> 00:08:20,390
Once, you know, department
of Education said,

138
00:08:20,391 --> 00:08:22,400
this is what we consider
sexual harassment.

139
00:08:22,670 --> 00:08:25,970
No College University administrator in
the right mind is going to look at that

140
00:08:25,971 --> 00:08:27,350
and say, oh, we'll just ignore that.

141
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:30,440
They're going to write new
policies because they don't
want huge investigations

142
00:08:30,441 --> 00:08:32,630
that costs a lot of money,
take a lot of time,

143
00:08:32,631 --> 00:08:37,250
and have ultimately the potential to cost
the school all of its federal funding

144
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:38,690
when it comes down to it.

145
00:08:39,020 --> 00:08:42,380
So we've seen the proliferation
of these really broad policies,

146
00:08:42,381 --> 00:08:46,010
some of which have hilarious lists of
examples of things that could constitute

147
00:08:46,011 --> 00:08:50,000
sexual harassment,
like inappropriately directed laughter,

148
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:52,980
elevator eyes is another fire fame for it.

149
00:08:53,210 --> 00:08:55,160
These are all things that
are known as flirting,

150
00:08:55,170 --> 00:08:58,800
recording or whatever you want to call it.
I'm sure there's a whole their term,

151
00:08:58,801 --> 00:09:03,090
but like that's how you meet people.
And sometimes it really is,

152
00:09:03,091 --> 00:09:08,091
and honestly it's the sexual
harassment angle has become a broader

153
00:09:08,451 --> 00:09:12,380
discriminatory harassment angle because
a lot of these policies start to look

154
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:14,930
the same based on any protected class.

155
00:09:15,650 --> 00:09:18,740
And so when you say that,
you know,

156
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:23,650
any unwelcome comment based on
a protected class, you know,

157
00:09:23,950 --> 00:09:28,250
and that's drawing from a
particular policy or anything
is harass discriminatory

158
00:09:28,251 --> 00:09:29,084
harassment.

159
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:34,240
Well that's a big problem because
that cuts off subjectively,

160
00:09:34,371 --> 00:09:38,390
whichever way you go. Basically half
of a debate, people for instance,

161
00:09:38,391 --> 00:09:43,391
on different sides of affirmative action
are both going to find their opponents

162
00:09:45,110 --> 00:09:48,950
ideology probably offensive.
Of course,

163
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:54,140
if you are against affirmative action
for whatever reason, you might be, uh,

164
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:57,200
people who support affirmative action,
they're going to say,

165
00:09:57,201 --> 00:10:02,201
well that is discriminatory based on a
protected class race and they shouldn't

166
00:10:03,261 --> 00:10:03,981
be allowed to say that.

167
00:10:03,981 --> 00:10:08,360
And yet we've seen students hosting events
like affirmative action bake sales to

168
00:10:08,361 --> 00:10:13,070
kind of make a point about what they
think is the unfairness and affirmative

169
00:10:13,071 --> 00:10:13,904
action.

170
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:19,300
And administrators have tried to shut
them down and sometimes have succeeded and

171
00:10:19,491 --> 00:10:21,980
shutting them down. Uh, and you know,

172
00:10:22,670 --> 00:10:25,940
I can give you countless examples
of things just like that,

173
00:10:26,570 --> 00:10:30,950
but it's dangerous because it kind of
creates an orthodoxy of what we're allowed

174
00:10:30,951 --> 00:10:33,710
to say, what we're allowed
to think. And you know,

175
00:10:34,220 --> 00:10:38,680
there is no position in that.
I can think of that.

176
00:10:39,020 --> 00:10:43,340
And I can say actually I think there is
no position that shouldn't be subject to

177
00:10:43,341 --> 00:10:44,174
challenge.

178
00:10:44,180 --> 00:10:49,180
There is nothing that
shouldn't be susceptible to
somebody disagreeing with it

179
00:10:49,670 --> 00:10:52,940
in a public way and
starting that conversation.

180
00:10:53,270 --> 00:10:57,770
Nobody has the right to
declare this is how it is.

181
00:10:58,010 --> 00:10:58,843
That is,

182
00:10:59,570 --> 00:11:03,620
I guess our collective to circle
all the way back to the beginning.

183
00:11:04,250 --> 00:11:09,250
It's our collective right to participate
in that decision of what we believe.

184
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:10,581
Yeah,

185
00:11:10,581 --> 00:11:14,540
and that's why I have such the problem
with this related to the way that the

186
00:11:14,541 --> 00:11:18,770
modern left bules with these things.
Because if you're going to say, all right,

187
00:11:18,771 --> 00:11:21,020
we're not going to draw
cartoons about certain things.

188
00:11:21,021 --> 00:11:23,090
Now I'm not saying you should go
out of your way to offend people,

189
00:11:23,390 --> 00:11:26,840
but once you say we're going to
allow certain things not to be done,

190
00:11:27,050 --> 00:11:30,560
you've handed all of your faculty,
all of your power,

191
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:34,490
all of your decision making capability
over to a certain set of people.

192
00:11:34,490 --> 00:11:37,190
It doesn't matter what those,
what those people believe in or are.

193
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:38,720
But then it's like,
well then they know,

194
00:11:38,721 --> 00:11:41,930
well we got them with something and we
can just keep going and going and going.

195
00:11:41,931 --> 00:11:46,770
And before you know it, you know it's
too late to, to fight back. I mean,

196
00:11:46,771 --> 00:11:50,760
and again, it's going to backfire. It's
going to backfire against the people. And,

197
00:11:50,761 --> 00:11:54,490
and I think that you see
it backfiring sometimes.

198
00:11:55,900 --> 00:11:59,890
You look at the faculty members recently
who have been targeted by outrage mobs

199
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:03,830
and people calling for their heads or
their jobs or sometimes both. Yeah. Um,

200
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:06,850
and they, sometimes when, by the
way, and my good friend Brett wines,

201
00:12:06,851 --> 00:12:08,230
then it still does not have a job.

202
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:14,100
Just recently for more striking example
even is a Fresno state ran to Gerard

203
00:12:15,220 --> 00:12:16,030
treated,
you know,

204
00:12:16,030 --> 00:12:21,010
some intemperate and not particularly
polite things about Barbara Bush right

205
00:12:21,011 --> 00:12:25,870
after she died. Um, and you're being very
kind and she can do whatever she wants.

206
00:12:25,871 --> 00:12:28,360
But yeah,
it was pretty nasty stuff.

207
00:12:28,390 --> 00:12:31,850
My mother told me never to speak ill of
the dead and so, you know, I don't know.

208
00:12:31,851 --> 00:12:34,080
I don't know. No, I mean
you were being nice to,

209
00:12:34,090 --> 00:12:39,090
to what was tweeted feelings on here and
it was the right that was calling for

210
00:12:40,961 --> 00:12:44,770
her head and we, I mean, one of my
colleagues, I felt really bad. I was,

211
00:12:45,610 --> 00:12:47,650
I was the one who helped write the letter,

212
00:12:47,651 --> 00:12:51,400
but he was the one who wrote our
public facing blog post on the website.

213
00:12:51,401 --> 00:12:55,420
He was getting hate mail and probably
still is getting hate mail from people

214
00:12:55,780 --> 00:12:59,650
saying, how could you defend this woman?
How could you, I mean, it goes both ways.

215
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:02,890
Everyone's going to sense try
and censor their opponent.

216
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:06,880
So just really be careful. Right.
Well, I'm glad you brought that one up.

217
00:13:06,881 --> 00:13:09,340
So basically this, this woman
who's, she's a professor, right?

218
00:13:09,490 --> 00:13:13,540
She tweeted some really nasty stuff about
Barbara Bush who had just died and by,

219
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:16,120
by every account,
Barbara Bush was a totally decent woman,

220
00:13:16,121 --> 00:13:18,520
but that's actually irrelevant for this.
And yes.

221
00:13:18,521 --> 00:13:21,430
Then the right started screaming and oh,
she should be fired. She should be fired.

222
00:13:21,431 --> 00:13:25,780
She was not fired. The Fresno
state. She's still there. Um,

223
00:13:26,140 --> 00:13:30,460
I thought, wow, this is an exact example
of how free speech is supposed to work.

224
00:13:30,820 --> 00:13:34,690
She said what she wanted people
mocked her or supported her.

225
00:13:34,810 --> 00:13:37,870
The university decided to make a
decision. Now, it's interesting.

226
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:40,720
If the university had fired her,
let's say they had said,

227
00:13:40,721 --> 00:13:42,250
these ideas are beyond the pale,

228
00:13:42,251 --> 00:13:45,270
and then people started digging into some
other things that she's said that are,

229
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:48,220
that are pretty radical.
If that had happened,

230
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:50,470
would you guys have offered her defense?

231
00:13:50,470 --> 00:13:53,680
Because doesn't the university have
the right to make the decisions that it

232
00:13:53,681 --> 00:13:56,380
wants? I don't know what their
policies are on on tenure, for example,

233
00:13:56,381 --> 00:13:57,214
or that sort of thing,

234
00:13:57,250 --> 00:14:00,460
but don't they have the right to employ
people that they want to be employed or

235
00:14:00,461 --> 00:14:01,010
not?

236
00:14:01,010 --> 00:14:05,110
Not that I want to give that power to
the mob because we know that the mob does

237
00:14:05,111 --> 00:14:08,590
awful things. It depends when
the government as an employer,

238
00:14:08,620 --> 00:14:13,620
the government actually is
restricted in what it can do for a,

239
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:19,270
an with her spot respect to an
employees off duty speech when a,

240
00:14:21,090 --> 00:14:24,220
and I think that's particularly important
with faculty members who are supposed

241
00:14:24,221 --> 00:14:25,540
to be public intellectuals.

242
00:14:25,541 --> 00:14:29,620
They're supposed to be out there and kind
of discussing and debating and this is

243
00:14:29,621 --> 00:14:33,010
what we expect out of faculty
members at colleges and universities.

244
00:14:33,340 --> 00:14:37,540
But when the government is the employer
and the speeches made as a private

245
00:14:37,541 --> 00:14:42,310
citizen on a matter of public concern
is this very clearly was then the

246
00:14:42,311 --> 00:14:47,311
government has to make a pretty high
showing that that speech so materially

247
00:14:47,590 --> 00:14:52,590
interferes with the provision of services
that the government is involved in,

248
00:14:53,330 --> 00:14:57,590
that it warrants overcoming the employer
employees first amendment rights.

249
00:14:58,150 --> 00:15:02,480
And we actually wrote a long letter
and was co-signed they by the Aclu of

250
00:15:02,481 --> 00:15:04,330
Northern California,
uh,

251
00:15:04,430 --> 00:15:07,580
the electronic frontier foundation
and a whole bunch of other, uh,

252
00:15:07,670 --> 00:15:11,750
organizations and on dryers
behalf and sent it in.

253
00:15:11,810 --> 00:15:15,230
Incidentally, shortly after
they got our letter, the,

254
00:15:15,260 --> 00:15:18,890
a university issued their statement that
they weren't going to discipline her.

255
00:15:18,891 --> 00:15:19,380
Right.

256
00:15:19,380 --> 00:15:24,260
So you are making the distinction in
this case that because this was not on

257
00:15:24,261 --> 00:15:28,450
campus, this wasn't being in a class,
you know, taught in the class or,

258
00:15:28,451 --> 00:15:31,970
or brainwashing students in the class
name that's different what she's doing on

259
00:15:31,971 --> 00:15:35,180
her private side. And especially because
as you said, as a public intellectual,

260
00:15:35,190 --> 00:15:39,710
you're supposed to be talking about stuff
that that's different than perhaps if

261
00:15:39,711 --> 00:15:42,590
she had said these very
same things in class,

262
00:15:42,860 --> 00:15:46,010
they could have taken a different stance
that maybe would've had a little more

263
00:15:46,190 --> 00:15:47,690
legal positioning.
Is that fair to say?

264
00:15:47,750 --> 00:15:52,240
That's where it gets tricky
because there's a circumstance. Um,

265
00:15:52,750 --> 00:15:54,220
the Supreme Court,
uh,

266
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:59,440
back in 2006 held that speech
made pursuant to official
job duties is basically

267
00:16:01,041 --> 00:16:04,640
speech that's commissioned by the
government and therefore it does not have

268
00:16:04,641 --> 00:16:06,830
first amendment protection.
You can be fired for it,

269
00:16:07,970 --> 00:16:12,970
but they did not decide whether or not
that would relate to speech that relates

270
00:16:14,511 --> 00:16:17,450
to scholarship or teaching,
uh, as a supreme court put it,

271
00:16:18,650 --> 00:16:23,480
which is due to the special concern about
academic freedom that we have for the

272
00:16:23,481 --> 00:16:27,020
reasons of faculty members
being public intellectuals.

273
00:16:27,860 --> 00:16:32,240
The Fourth Circuit and the ninth circuit
or California's have both said that no,

274
00:16:32,241 --> 00:16:33,140
this ruling,

275
00:16:33,380 --> 00:16:37,760
that speech pursuant to official job
duties does not apply at colleges and

276
00:16:37,761 --> 00:16:41,330
universities, uh, to speech that
relates to scholarship or teaching.

277
00:16:41,450 --> 00:16:44,960
So in California she could
have been protected either way,

278
00:16:44,961 --> 00:16:47,150
but it's not that way
all around the country.

279
00:16:47,150 --> 00:16:52,150
Some courts have declined to find that
exception to the 2006 Garcetti ruling.

280
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:55,910
Um, others have kind of
ignored it for the time being.

281
00:16:55,911 --> 00:17:00,350
So one of these days the supreme court's
probably going to have to make another

282
00:17:00,351 --> 00:17:01,910
decision on that. Yeah. I'm curious,

283
00:17:01,911 --> 00:17:04,250
I know you guys are a
nonpartisan organization,

284
00:17:04,251 --> 00:17:07,220
but if these decisions
were left up to the states,

285
00:17:07,730 --> 00:17:10,520
do you guys have a position
on that in and of itself?

286
00:17:10,521 --> 00:17:14,360
I'm sure you have a personal position,
but does fire have a position on that?

287
00:17:14,420 --> 00:17:15,320
I mean,
I think our,

288
00:17:15,330 --> 00:17:20,120
our position is that the exception for
scholarship or teaching absolutely should

289
00:17:20,121 --> 00:17:21,530
be applied across the country.

290
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:26,800
It's really fundamentally important for
faculty members to be able to conduct,

291
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:33,710
you know, controversial, disruptive, you
know, as it relates to the status quo.

292
00:17:33,740 --> 00:17:38,740
Research and writing without fearing
for their jobs because that's how we're

293
00:17:39,381 --> 00:17:41,390
going to get new ideas.

294
00:17:41,660 --> 00:17:44,630
If you just talk about things that
aren't going to rock the boat,

295
00:17:44,631 --> 00:17:47,030
if you just research things that
aren't going to rock the boat,

296
00:17:47,270 --> 00:17:51,420
we're never going to get anywhere
you, you need the bomb throwers. Yeah,

297
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:54,450
there's room for that.
So what about cases where,

298
00:17:54,451 --> 00:17:57,690
and I guess this brings up a little bit
related to tenure because I think there

299
00:17:57,691 --> 00:18:01,290
is something interesting because
it's funny, I hear from professors,

300
00:18:01,470 --> 00:18:05,730
I get a ton of emails from professors
saying that they love what we're doing

301
00:18:05,731 --> 00:18:09,960
here and that they are afraid sometimes
tenured professors are still afraid of

302
00:18:09,961 --> 00:18:12,810
the mob. They know they're not going to
get fired, but they're afraid of the mob.

303
00:18:13,590 --> 00:18:18,300
Is there an inherent problem in tenure
in a way now? Because you could,

304
00:18:18,301 --> 00:18:21,720
if you have that protection, and I'm
all for saying whatever you want to say,

305
00:18:21,930 --> 00:18:24,390
that technically if you were
a history history professor,

306
00:18:24,391 --> 00:18:26,010
let's say you could start,

307
00:18:26,460 --> 00:18:30,510
you could just start losing your
mind and teaching really dishonest,

308
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:33,750
complete reversal of the truth stuff.
Um,

309
00:18:33,810 --> 00:18:38,220
and have the protection of not being
fired like that actually handicaps the

310
00:18:38,221 --> 00:18:40,890
pursuit of knowledge from, from
the university, doesn't it?

311
00:18:41,070 --> 00:18:44,130
I'm not terribly concerned about
that because generally speaking,

312
00:18:44,190 --> 00:18:49,190
there are ways for faculty
to be disciplined or are
removed even with tenure,

313
00:18:51,180 --> 00:18:55,770
oftentimes for gross professional,
you know, competency issues.

314
00:18:55,830 --> 00:18:58,350
Um, you know, if you are, say,

315
00:18:58,770 --> 00:19:02,940
teaching math and you're teaching
students that two plus two is 17,

316
00:19:03,690 --> 00:19:07,080
I think that's in common core.
You can,

317
00:19:07,870 --> 00:19:12,870
there's ways that the university can
address that and that's not really what

318
00:19:13,951 --> 00:19:17,070
we're seeing. What we're seeing
more often as a, for instance,

319
00:19:17,071 --> 00:19:20,190
the professor who's teaching physics,

320
00:19:20,191 --> 00:19:24,960
who is on the side of the Holocaust
Denier, uh, and he's, you know,

321
00:19:25,020 --> 00:19:26,970
maybe not necessarily
teaching that in class,

322
00:19:26,971 --> 00:19:31,971
but does that have any ramifications
for his ability to teach physics?

323
00:19:32,550 --> 00:19:33,940
Probably not.
Um,

324
00:19:34,050 --> 00:19:38,100
that's not a competency competency to
teach the topic that you were hired to

325
00:19:38,101 --> 00:19:38,934
teach things.

326
00:19:39,150 --> 00:19:43,230
But if it leaked into the classroom then
that then it's a separate issue. That's,

327
00:19:43,260 --> 00:19:43,531
well,

328
00:19:43,531 --> 00:19:48,000
if you are teaching a class on physics
and find some occasion to talk about the

329
00:19:48,001 --> 00:19:48,631
Holocaust,

330
00:19:48,631 --> 00:19:51,960
I think you're probably not teaching the
thing that you are hired to do and then

331
00:19:51,961 --> 00:19:53,990
it's up to the school to
decide what to do. Yeah,

332
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:57,000
that's a different problem I think.
Um,

333
00:19:57,350 --> 00:20:00,930
I think that that indicates pretty
squarely along with the denial of the

334
00:20:00,931 --> 00:20:04,590
Holocaust happened that you are
in fact losing your mind. Right.

335
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:08,910
So what are some of the cases may be one
or two cases that you guys are working

336
00:20:08,911 --> 00:20:12,240
on right now or that you have your
eye on right now that you think are

337
00:20:12,241 --> 00:20:14,430
particularly relevant that
people should know about? Well,

338
00:20:14,431 --> 00:20:17,610
we just issued a press release
this morning. In fact, uh,

339
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:20,790
just Amir hour or two before I came here,
uh,

340
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:24,570
at Syracuse University where we sent
a letter on Friday. Uh, this one is,

341
00:20:24,610 --> 00:20:28,560
it's just bananas. Yeah. Let me pause
you for a second. I haven't read it yet,

342
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:32,550
but I wanted to go to Syracuse to be in
broadcasting because I wanted to be like

343
00:20:32,551 --> 00:20:36,180
a news anchor or a or a sports center
anchor road. I really want it to be,

344
00:20:36,181 --> 00:20:37,600
but there are big broadcasting school,

345
00:20:37,601 --> 00:20:41,390
so I'm already fascinated by
this as a place that's, you know,

346
00:20:41,580 --> 00:20:45,390
about disseminating information. Well,
you might be glad you didn't hear this.

347
00:20:45,391 --> 00:20:46,224
Here we go.

348
00:20:47,020 --> 00:20:52,020
A fraternity had an event every year where
the pledges or new members would come

349
00:20:54,671 --> 00:20:54,971
in.

350
00:20:54,971 --> 00:20:59,971
It was a private event and they would do
skits that roasted the other members of

351
00:21:00,401 --> 00:21:05,040
the fraternity. A lot of fraternities
have this kind of tradition. Um,

352
00:21:05,170 --> 00:21:06,670
I'm pretty sure that minded.

353
00:21:07,690 --> 00:21:12,690
But they went through some
skits and one of them,

354
00:21:13,331 --> 00:21:13,901
for example,

355
00:21:13,901 --> 00:21:18,901
was making fun of a member of the
fraternity who was a known and vocal Trump

356
00:21:19,361 --> 00:21:20,710
supporter and conservative.

357
00:21:21,220 --> 00:21:26,180
So they satirized him by having somebody
who is supposed to be him starting as

358
00:21:26,270 --> 00:21:29,380
rival fraternity.
That was quote unquote a white empire.

359
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:34,180
And to join people had to take a
horrifically racist, antisemitic, uh,

360
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:39,100
oath and sounds like it's all in good fun.
Well,

361
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:42,480
whatever. May Be tasteless, but all
in good fun. You know what they're,

362
00:21:42,590 --> 00:21:46,750
they're satirizing and it's no different
than you see comedians doing all the

363
00:21:46,751 --> 00:21:51,710
time on a stage. Satirizing people.
Yeah. Uh, another one was, uh,

364
00:21:52,180 --> 00:21:54,000
they Saturdays,

365
00:21:54,010 --> 00:21:57,400
one of their brothers for being
chronically whipped by his girlfriend and

366
00:21:57,401 --> 00:22:01,600
portrayed him as a mentally retarded
and they had him in a wheelchair and all

367
00:22:01,610 --> 00:22:04,030
that stuff and this was
all on a private event.

368
00:22:04,330 --> 00:22:08,260
And you hear the laughter in the
audience indicated that nobody was really

369
00:22:08,261 --> 00:22:12,400
offended by it. They understood this
is kind of just poking fun at people.

370
00:22:13,630 --> 00:22:18,220
The problem is that videos of it leaked
and the student newspaper published them,

371
00:22:19,060 --> 00:22:22,150
which you know, they have the right to
do as well. You can't begrudge them that.

372
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:25,900
And of course,
as you might imagine,

373
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:30,520
outrage erupted and the,

374
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:35,260
within a matter of days the fraternity
had been expelled permanently from

375
00:22:35,261 --> 00:22:36,094
campus.

376
00:22:37,030 --> 00:22:42,030
18 students have been charged
with disciplinary conduct
or business disciplinary

377
00:22:42,881 --> 00:22:47,880
code violations and they're
being threatened with
suspension or expulsion. Uh,

378
00:22:47,980 --> 00:22:51,730
and this is like all right before finals.
And meanwhile a,

379
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:56,260
an adjunct faculty member had the
gall to express concern about how the

380
00:22:56,261 --> 00:22:59,710
university was handling all of this
and they immediately told them, uh,

381
00:23:00,340 --> 00:23:01,960
because you've used don't align with ours,

382
00:23:01,961 --> 00:23:06,580
you are no longer qualified to teach
at Syracuse University unbelief.

383
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:10,610
And it's incredibly author authoritarian
sounding. I mean, they are,

384
00:23:10,660 --> 00:23:15,040
they're just reeling to steamroll over
anybody who gets in their way in pursuit

385
00:23:15,041 --> 00:23:20,041
of really just giving somebody a head on
a pike so that the crowd is mollified,

386
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:24,100
you know, it's, I mean, it's nuts.
They've charged them with, uh,

387
00:23:24,220 --> 00:23:28,250
sexual harassment,
discriminatory harassment. Uh,

388
00:23:28,750 --> 00:23:33,750
nevermind the fact that nobody who the
speech was actually intended for actually

389
00:23:34,061 --> 00:23:37,180
was offended by it.
It didn't,

390
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:41,110
it's not their fault. You know,
they don't know how the videos lead.

391
00:23:41,111 --> 00:23:45,530
They are posting to a private Facebook
page and somebody must've had to

392
00:23:45,540 --> 00:23:47,210
somebody's computer or
something like that.

393
00:23:47,690 --> 00:23:52,250
But the speech was purely private
and nobody was offended by it.

394
00:23:52,310 --> 00:23:57,310
And if every conversation between
two students can be the grounds for

395
00:23:58,310 --> 00:24:02,240
disciplinary investigation because a
third party later found out what was said

396
00:24:02,241 --> 00:24:06,340
during that conversation. Well,
um, we'd all be in jail. Yeah,

397
00:24:06,470 --> 00:24:10,760
exactly. It reduces free
speech to a complete melody.

398
00:24:10,790 --> 00:24:15,110
It's crazy. Uh, and you know, it's just,

399
00:24:15,140 --> 00:24:15,980
it's really,

400
00:24:15,981 --> 00:24:20,760
it's galling and be just
really harsh and punitive, uh,

401
00:24:20,900 --> 00:24:24,620
bent of the, of the university and
all of this is mystifying. Wait,

402
00:24:24,621 --> 00:24:26,000
so just on the technical side now,

403
00:24:26,001 --> 00:24:28,910
because this is something good
that Trump's done related to this,

404
00:24:28,911 --> 00:24:32,990
because he got rid of a lot of the title
nine expansions and all that and device

405
00:24:32,991 --> 00:24:36,500
and they got rid of that stuff, which I
assume you agree with, right? Basically.

406
00:24:36,890 --> 00:24:40,130
I mean, it's stuff that we had spent a
lot of time fighting against. Right. Okay.

407
00:24:40,131 --> 00:24:42,230
So Obama expanded at Trump,
got rid of it.

408
00:24:42,231 --> 00:24:44,090
I think for the nae in
the name of free speech,

409
00:24:44,091 --> 00:24:47,630
when you hear stories of like Laura Kipnis
who I've had on and and many others,

410
00:24:47,900 --> 00:24:49,640
the witch hunts that
happen that are crazy.

411
00:24:49,850 --> 00:24:53,000
So these policies that they're
saying that these students violated,

412
00:24:53,180 --> 00:24:55,730
these have nothing to do with
government policies, right? These,

413
00:24:55,731 --> 00:24:58,610
they're saying they violated
school policies, is that correct?

414
00:24:58,680 --> 00:24:59,513
I just want to be clear.

415
00:24:59,540 --> 00:25:02,930
They're discriminatory harassment policies
are obviously drawn on a lot of the

416
00:25:02,931 --> 00:25:07,931
same language because they receive
federal money in the form of student loans

417
00:25:08,181 --> 00:25:10,610
and things like that. So they actually
still have to adhere to title nine,

418
00:25:10,611 --> 00:25:15,180
even though they're not a
state institution, obviously.
Um, but you know, they,

419
00:25:15,890 --> 00:25:19,820
they've been charged with this
laundry list of offenses. Uh, they've,

420
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:23,870
the administration has been rushing
through trying to kind of get the process

421
00:25:23,871 --> 00:25:25,670
over with as soon as possible.
Meanwhile,

422
00:25:25,671 --> 00:25:30,671
not giving them really a lot of details
until just recently in terms of what the

423
00:25:31,491 --> 00:25:33,650
charges are based on and,
and all of this. I mean,

424
00:25:33,651 --> 00:25:37,830
it's very clearly a steam
rolling and, uh, it's,

425
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:42,050
it's outrageous. Uh, and you know,
that's kind of the most recent thing.

426
00:25:42,051 --> 00:25:44,510
So tell me a little bit about how you
guys get involved in that. So, okay,

427
00:25:44,511 --> 00:25:47,240
so you issue a press statement
now or a press release.

428
00:25:47,241 --> 00:25:49,610
Now they know they have a
little bit of public defense.

429
00:25:49,940 --> 00:25:51,830
Do you guys actually
work with the students?

430
00:25:51,831 --> 00:25:55,280
Like just kind of lay out how that
whole process goes? Yeah, so, uh,

431
00:25:55,281 --> 00:25:59,660
on our website we have a, a format
anyone can fill out to request help.

432
00:25:59,690 --> 00:26:04,550
And me and my team every morning we'll
go through the case submissions and,

433
00:26:04,580 --> 00:26:09,050
uh, we'll review them and,
you know, follow up for more
documentation if necessary.

434
00:26:09,050 --> 00:26:11,900
And like I said, we get damn near close
to a thousand of them a year now, uh,

435
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:15,350
which is a lot of work.
Um,

436
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:20,680
and we investigate and develop the cases
and figure out what the best situation,

437
00:26:21,470 --> 00:26:24,630
you know, the best possible
tactics in each case would be. Um,

438
00:26:24,830 --> 00:26:28,520
usually the next step involves writing
a letter telling the university which in

439
00:26:28,521 --> 00:26:31,910
Syracuse case we sent out on
Friday, uh, telling them, hey,

440
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:34,170
this is the applicable law,
are these the,

441
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:38,390
the political applicable norms that you
should be adhering to as though college,

442
00:26:38,830 --> 00:26:43,510
um, and here's why what you're doing
has run a fall of all of that. Um,

443
00:26:43,620 --> 00:26:47,650
generally speaking, you know,
we'll wait for a response, uh,

444
00:26:48,270 --> 00:26:48,991
in good faith,

445
00:26:48,991 --> 00:26:52,200
given the university some time
to acknowledge our concerns
and work through them.

446
00:26:52,630 --> 00:26:55,380
And, you know, otherwise
we will, excuse me,

447
00:26:56,190 --> 00:27:00,690
issue a press release and start bringing
public pressure to bear sometimes in

448
00:27:00,691 --> 00:27:05,680
public college and university cases.
We'll take it to litigation if we have to.

449
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:09,760
Not every case, obviously,
because you know, there's a
range of cases that are, uh,

450
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:12,030
you know,
make for a good lawsuit.

451
00:27:12,031 --> 00:27:15,930
But even just recently filed the
lawsuit of Joliet Junior College,

452
00:27:16,140 --> 00:27:17,460
and this is kind of again,

453
00:27:17,490 --> 00:27:21,870
kind of flips the narrative a little bit
because it was a students who saw, uh,

454
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:23,360
people,
uh,

455
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:27,780
basically talking about how capitalism
is great and decided that she wanted to

456
00:27:27,781 --> 00:27:31,370
make a good point about socialism.
So she handed out, you know,

457
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:36,030
and distributed flyers about how, you
know, they said shutdown capitalism,

458
00:27:36,060 --> 00:27:39,990
inviting people to like a
workshop, uh, about socialism.

459
00:27:40,020 --> 00:27:43,680
This was actually not far from where
I live in Chicago's and Joliet junior

460
00:27:43,681 --> 00:27:44,514
college.

461
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:49,880
And she was actually confronted
by a number of campus
police officers who pulled

462
00:27:51,031 --> 00:27:52,620
her into an interrogation room,

463
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:56,580
demanded to examine the flyers and
then confiscated them and saying,

464
00:27:56,820 --> 00:28:01,110
you can't do that here. You know, the, the
political climate, you know right now is,

465
00:28:01,140 --> 00:28:02,820
you know,
might start something.

466
00:28:03,150 --> 00:28:06,790
I'm actually shocked to hear it happening
that the story is not the reverse big.

467
00:28:06,890 --> 00:28:09,990
This is an odd one. I'm glad you used
it as an example. Actually, you know,

468
00:28:09,991 --> 00:28:14,130
it goes to show, I actually, you know,
you'll be interested to hear this. I, my,

469
00:28:14,290 --> 00:28:18,240
my team and I actually did a really a
quick analysis and this isn't scientific

470
00:28:18,241 --> 00:28:21,640
or anything of all the
public cases that we've, uh,

471
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:24,300
have on our website from the
beginning of fires history.

472
00:28:25,590 --> 00:28:30,590
And actually more than half of them
have nothing to do with politics.

473
00:28:31,650 --> 00:28:36,650
More than half of them are simply
administrators having power again and when

474
00:28:38,841 --> 00:28:43,841
they have the power that will use it
to regulate or silence speech that they

475
00:28:44,401 --> 00:28:49,340
find in convenient or critical of
the university or administrators or,

476
00:28:49,410 --> 00:28:52,230
or just kind of not nice.

477
00:28:52,230 --> 00:28:57,230
Generally less than half of our cases
had to do with speakers being silenced

478
00:28:58,321 --> 00:29:03,270
specifically because of the viewpoint
they were espousing. On a political level.

479
00:29:03,930 --> 00:29:08,310
It's, you know, it kind of
undoes a lot of the narrative.

480
00:29:08,311 --> 00:29:11,610
And to be honest, I'm kind of a
little bit tired of the whole,

481
00:29:11,850 --> 00:29:14,730
whether the right or left love censorship,
more argument.

482
00:29:14,731 --> 00:29:18,600
I think it's completely unproductive
and does nothing to solve the problem,

483
00:29:18,601 --> 00:29:22,890
which is we all need to understand why
protecting free speech is important.

484
00:29:23,090 --> 00:29:27,120
I'd much rather focus my
time there. Um, and you know,

485
00:29:27,121 --> 00:29:31,650
so it's really that whole narrative can,

486
00:29:31,651 --> 00:29:35,790
could use a little deconstructing for a
little bit. And I'm glad that, you know,

487
00:29:35,791 --> 00:29:39,930
we had that case that kind of allowed us
to, to show it and people appreciate it.

488
00:29:39,940 --> 00:29:42,760
I got a lot of messages from people
on the right who said, you know,

489
00:29:42,761 --> 00:29:47,410
I disagree with everything that
that young woman had to say.

490
00:29:47,830 --> 00:29:51,850
Uh, and I would sit there and
I would yell that in her face,

491
00:29:52,180 --> 00:29:55,900
but you know what? I'm damn glad you guys
stood up for her rights. And you know,

492
00:29:56,440 --> 00:29:58,250
when I get messages like that,
it just,

493
00:29:58,270 --> 00:30:02,710
it warms my heart and I get
them from people on both
sides saying, you know what,

494
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:07,300
I probably wouldn't have reacted in the
same way you did leaping to a defense of

495
00:30:07,301 --> 00:30:10,990
free speech. But I'm glad you did it
because I got something out of that.

496
00:30:11,590 --> 00:30:15,550
You know, it made me think about
why my reaction wasn't that. Uh,

497
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:20,230
and if I, if I get, if I
can elicit that in people,

498
00:30:21,010 --> 00:30:25,840
I feel great about my day. That's
the heavy lifting I think. Well,

499
00:30:25,900 --> 00:30:29,180
that's a beautiful thing and that's
why I did what you guys are doing. Uh,

500
00:30:29,470 --> 00:30:32,980
the final thing I want to mention is that
I just remembered in this last moment

501
00:30:32,981 --> 00:30:34,430
that the reason that you're here,
I,

502
00:30:34,431 --> 00:30:37,300
so I had wanted to have one of you guys
on for about a year or so and you've

503
00:30:37,301 --> 00:30:39,400
been on our,
our master list of all this.

504
00:30:39,820 --> 00:30:42,490
And then I think about
three months or so ago,

505
00:30:42,491 --> 00:30:47,260
someone tweeted at me that they
were at school, at school library,

506
00:30:47,500 --> 00:30:50,590
and they were watching a
video of me and Ben Shapiro,

507
00:30:50,620 --> 00:30:52,690
and that they were reported to the,

508
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:57,250
either the diversity office or one of
these things that it was hate speech and

509
00:30:57,251 --> 00:31:01,480
that another student shouldn't be allowed
to, to watch these, these evil things,

510
00:31:01,481 --> 00:31:04,420
et Cetera, et cetera. It turns
out that this was in the UK,

511
00:31:04,421 --> 00:31:08,590
so it was not under the jurisdiction
that you guys, uh, cover,

512
00:31:08,591 --> 00:31:12,940
which obviously is the United States.
Um, but it just shows that this thing,

513
00:31:13,060 --> 00:31:17,380
this monster that we're fighting
is not local to us here in America.

514
00:31:17,381 --> 00:31:18,550
It's all over the world.

515
00:31:18,551 --> 00:31:23,530
And there are other organizations like
fire that do this work. And uh, yeah.

516
00:31:23,650 --> 00:31:26,380
And although it's depressing to know
that somebody is being reported for

517
00:31:26,381 --> 00:31:27,940
watching a video that I put out there,

518
00:31:28,150 --> 00:31:30,790
it's good to know that you
guys all came to the rush.

519
00:31:30,790 --> 00:31:32,590
You all came to the defense
and you were like, who is it?

520
00:31:32,591 --> 00:31:35,050
Can we connect with them? You know, I
connected them with some of your people.

521
00:31:35,051 --> 00:31:38,650
I think, and maybe you've passed them on,
so I connected them with spikes. Okay.

522
00:31:38,660 --> 00:31:40,930
So there is over there.
Yeah it is. And you know,

523
00:31:41,030 --> 00:31:45,340
you see it happening in Canada all
the time. The UK, I mean you can,

524
00:31:45,910 --> 00:31:48,700
I have Google alerts set and every,
no,

525
00:31:48,760 --> 00:31:51,700
I wouldn't say every morning cause
it's more like 40,000 times a day.

526
00:31:51,701 --> 00:31:56,110
I get emails from Google with the latest
headlines about free speech and it's

527
00:31:56,111 --> 00:31:57,700
not just even the UK and Canada.

528
00:31:57,730 --> 00:32:01,840
There are students protesting in India
about freedom of speech issues and all

529
00:32:01,841 --> 00:32:06,790
kinds of countries. Australia, it's a big
conversation right now. This is, you know,

530
00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:11,290
it's just not limited to here.
It's not limited to anywhere. This,

531
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:14,590
the idea that college
campuses are kind of a,

532
00:32:14,770 --> 00:32:19,770
both a microcosm of society and
a training ground and an night,

533
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:25,630
a place where the ideas of the country,
uh, kind of come from in a large sense.

534
00:32:26,110 --> 00:32:30,070
That's kind of a global concept.

535
00:32:30,071 --> 00:32:33,400
I don't think that's limited to
higher education in the United States.

536
00:32:33,401 --> 00:32:34,630
And you know,
it's,

537
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:38,810
I really hope that we can
convince students that that's
where the safeguarding,

538
00:32:38,890 --> 00:32:43,760
uh, it's, it's too important
not to. Well said, my friend,

539
00:32:43,761 --> 00:32:48,140
I'm with Ya. And for more on the fine work
that Ari and the fire folks are doing,
