1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:05,050
There we go. Oh, and we're live.
Hello. Okay. And that was that.

2
00:00:05,330 --> 00:00:06,750
That's looking that easy. That easy. Yeah.

3
00:00:06,990 --> 00:00:10,010
We didn't say very much
interesting before it started. No,

4
00:00:10,170 --> 00:00:14,180
we were starting and then you just said
shut the fuck said, hold that thought.

5
00:00:14,300 --> 00:00:17,130
Plus this, uh, this concept
of things getting better.

6
00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:20,910
And we were talking about war more being
too cause as a world war II helmet that

7
00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:24,510
um, Shane against the machine
is the gentleman's name.

8
00:00:24,511 --> 00:00:29,010
He's made me another sculpture and he
started making sculptures out of a,

9
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:34,040
these world war two helmets with a lamp
underneath it and an actual real world

10
00:00:34,141 --> 00:00:35,250
war II ban out as well.

11
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:39,750
And you were saying was a terrible idea
that it's going away, you think? Really?

12
00:00:39,751 --> 00:00:41,670
Yeah. Real really fast. And you,

13
00:00:41,671 --> 00:00:45,780
you mentioned Pinker and that's everything
I will say is redundant to Pinker.

14
00:00:46,050 --> 00:00:49,590
I mean that I'm a better
angels of our nature is one of,

15
00:00:49,591 --> 00:00:53,790
I think the most subversive books
of our time. You know, people are,

16
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:58,650
there's such a, um,
it's a fetish to suffer.

17
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:02,700
It's a fetish to say how bad things
are. People getting really off on it.

18
00:01:03,150 --> 00:01:04,890
And when you start saying, you know,

19
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:10,670
after you say one death by violence
is too many and we got to clean up the

20
00:01:10,921 --> 00:01:14,190
environment and duh duh duh duh, duh,
say all that stuff and it's all true.

21
00:01:14,370 --> 00:01:17,430
But you can also take a breath and
say things are getting better. Yeah,

22
00:01:17,431 --> 00:01:20,910
I think we need to recognize
that. And the problem is there is,

23
00:01:21,510 --> 00:01:23,820
there is violence, there
is horrible things,

24
00:01:23,821 --> 00:01:25,050
there are horrible things in the world.

25
00:01:25,330 --> 00:01:29,220
They still exist and now they're magnified
because of the fact that we have this

26
00:01:29,221 --> 00:01:32,220
ability to look at it on your phone
anytime you want to look at it on your

27
00:01:32,221 --> 00:01:34,050
computer. When you say one
thing, it's the same thing.

28
00:01:34,050 --> 00:01:37,800
I think calories in information
are identical, you know,

29
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:42,330
for millions, billion years.
Um, the biggest problem,

30
00:01:42,331 --> 00:01:47,230
every living thing had was too
few calories. And then for a,

31
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:50,460
what may be 75 years,

32
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:55,700
a very small percentage of the animals
in the world had this problem of too many

33
00:01:55,981 --> 00:01:59,340
calories and there's nothing
that prepares anybody for that.

34
00:01:59,740 --> 00:02:04,590
We now have more information in
one issue of the New York times.

35
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:10,040
Then I'm a 17th century peasant
would had in their entire life.

36
00:02:11,070 --> 00:02:16,050
So we have this glut of information that
we're dealing with about as well as we

37
00:02:16,051 --> 00:02:18,780
dealt with calories. I talked
about this quite often,

38
00:02:18,781 --> 00:02:22,860
but the way I describe it as diet and
that most people have a poor diet and then

39
00:02:22,861 --> 00:02:24,690
most people's diet is not nutritious.

40
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:28,560
And if you have a poor diet that's not
nutritious, your body becomes unhealthy.

41
00:02:28,561 --> 00:02:30,510
Well, if you have a poor mental diet,

42
00:02:31,010 --> 00:02:33,450
and I've discovered how many people do
we talk about this with like three or

43
00:02:33,451 --> 00:02:37,020
four people we've been talking about
this, like taking in information.

44
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:40,110
You should almost think of it as a
mental diet because if you've taken bad

45
00:02:40,111 --> 00:02:44,430
information all the time and negative
information, I will speak for myself,

46
00:02:44,431 --> 00:02:49,110
but I don't think I'm in any way alone.
I often forget where I read stuff,

47
00:02:49,740 --> 00:02:54,740
so I have to be really careful to not
read too much garbage or it just pops up

48
00:02:55,501 --> 00:02:57,790
in my head is, Oh, that's
real. Right. You know?

49
00:02:57,990 --> 00:03:02,740
So I try to go with the new sources
that are, I think are pretty reliable.

50
00:03:02,890 --> 00:03:04,180
Even if I disagree with them.

51
00:03:04,270 --> 00:03:08,170
Like I try to read the times cause I
know there's a level to how much they're

52
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:12,490
going to lie. We know, we know where
the parameters are. They're lying there,

53
00:03:12,580 --> 00:03:13,090
you know,

54
00:03:13,090 --> 00:03:16,870
we know where they do the spin and if
you just just pop around the web at

55
00:03:16,871 --> 00:03:19,960
random, you can't tell what kind
of information you're getting.

56
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:23,060
But I also want to add
to this, you know, it's,

57
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:25,840
it's exactly the way I
feel about drugs, you know,

58
00:03:26,170 --> 00:03:29,620
as much as I want to say,
this is not right for me.

59
00:03:30,010 --> 00:03:34,780
Information has to be out there and all
information. Absolutely no gatekeepers,

60
00:03:34,990 --> 00:03:36,340
you know. No, I, I completely agree.

61
00:03:36,341 --> 00:03:40,330
And I think that we're coming very close
to a time where technology allows us to

62
00:03:40,331 --> 00:03:43,130
understand what's true and what's
not true. We're not there yet,

63
00:03:43,510 --> 00:03:44,380
but I think we're,

64
00:03:44,381 --> 00:03:49,330
we're really close to being able to have
some sort of an ability to read minds

65
00:03:49,410 --> 00:03:52,990
to, to decipher information
like really clearly.

66
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:55,750
But the problem with reading minds, um,

67
00:03:55,780 --> 00:04:00,780
if we could do it to ascertain truth
is a truth is very different from what

68
00:04:01,841 --> 00:04:05,410
someone believes. You know, if
you had a perfect lie detector,

69
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:08,410
it would not help you with
criminality at all. Cause you know,

70
00:04:08,411 --> 00:04:11,920
people that think they're innocent may
very well think they're innocent even if

71
00:04:11,921 --> 00:04:14,860
they are not. Oh sure, sure. Yeah,
that's a really good point. And you know,

72
00:04:14,861 --> 00:04:18,940
another really good point, his memory
is very fallible. Oh yeah. C I a,

73
00:04:18,950 --> 00:04:19,870
you know, I got a lot of,

74
00:04:20,030 --> 00:04:22,180
I've got a lot of shit for this and
I talked about it a little bit on,

75
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:26,110
on my podcast, but um, you know, I
was in the room with Trump a lot.

76
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:29,620
You know I did two tours.
I did two tours of duty.

77
00:04:31,050 --> 00:04:32,410
Tell me about that. What does that like?

78
00:04:32,830 --> 00:04:35,740
Cause I was supposed to do that show
and I passed on it. Yeah. I was like,

79
00:04:35,741 --> 00:04:38,080
I don't want to live in New York for
three months or whatever. It was.

80
00:04:38,260 --> 00:04:41,620
Just seemed like it's
wise. Either way. It was a,

81
00:04:41,621 --> 00:04:44,170
it was a primetime television show.

82
00:04:44,380 --> 00:04:48,820
So it's sold tickets and that is our
job. Right. And that's what we do.

83
00:04:49,150 --> 00:04:53,140
And I went on with one idea in
my head, you know, Annie Duke,

84
00:04:53,141 --> 00:04:56,850
you know the poker player she had been
on the year before. And I said, um,

85
00:04:57,130 --> 00:05:00,380
why am I going on? I mean, I know I'm
normally going to sell tickets and that's,

86
00:05:00,410 --> 00:05:04,210
that's just a done deal, but where
am I going on? What's my real goal?

87
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:07,750
And she said, go on and show
that atheist can be kind.

88
00:05:08,830 --> 00:05:11,680
That'll be your only goal
for the whole show. Oh,

89
00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:14,170
because they're going to jump
on you for being an atheist.

90
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:17,920
They'll jump all over you for that and
just show that you're the one that gets

91
00:05:17,921 --> 00:05:18,760
mad the least.

92
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:23,350
So the one that you're the nicest guy on
there and you're the hardcore atheist.

93
00:05:23,351 --> 00:05:25,270
And I went, okay, that's a good goal.

94
00:05:25,570 --> 00:05:28,900
But then you sit in the room and
I don't know how well, you know,

95
00:05:29,050 --> 00:05:32,170
the president of United States, I don't
want to know him at all. Yeah. Um,

96
00:05:32,380 --> 00:05:35,230
but you spend, um, uh,

97
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:40,800
bout two or three hours every other day
sitting in a room across the table like

98
00:05:41,351 --> 00:05:43,510
this with a table. You
can't put your hands on,

99
00:05:43,780 --> 00:05:46,470
why can't you put your hands on
it? Because it might Mar it in.

100
00:05:46,670 --> 00:05:48,190
That's hilarious. Put a hand print on it.

101
00:05:48,220 --> 00:05:51,340
They literally tell you don't put your
hands on the table and you have to sit up

102
00:05:51,341 --> 00:05:55,600
straight. And the camera, if you're
like the team captain, which by the way,

103
00:05:55,601 --> 00:05:57,650
they hate it if you
call them team captain,

104
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:01,200
they like to have it, you know, sub
sort of business jargon and you're in a,

105
00:06:01,201 --> 00:06:05,570
you're in a set. And that's the thing
that everybody else on the show would say.

106
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:08,060
We're going into the board
room now. And I'd say, no,

107
00:06:08,210 --> 00:06:12,110
we're going onto the board room set.
So it wasn't a real board room? No,

108
00:06:12,111 --> 00:06:15,520
of course not. None of it was really
a sound stage. Ah, it was, you know,

109
00:06:15,530 --> 00:06:18,600
it was in the Trump towers,
but they'd taken over Florida,

110
00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:21,410
NBC guts it and puts up this shit.

111
00:06:21,590 --> 00:06:25,130
And then you've got your camera
that your hero camera that's um,

112
00:06:25,340 --> 00:06:29,840
over your shoulder that shooting Trump.
So you can't lean into the camera.

113
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:30,290
Right.

114
00:06:30,290 --> 00:06:33,650
And they want a little piece of you so
you can't lean out of the camera so that

115
00:06:33,651 --> 00:06:38,651
you've gotten about two hours where you
sit up straight and you can't move side

116
00:06:39,261 --> 00:06:43,250
to side and you can't put your hands
on the table and you listen to someone

117
00:06:43,251 --> 00:06:44,980
speak for two hours that they're good at.

118
00:06:44,980 --> 00:06:49,610
Try to edit out to get three
minutes where he sounds okay.

119
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:54,680
Okay. What does he have to say for two
hours? He will talk. He would talk,

120
00:06:54,681 --> 00:06:58,850
I mean, things obviously have
changed, but he would talk about, uh,

121
00:06:59,090 --> 00:07:03,530
I was reading this blog on the internet
that said I didn't sell my property for

122
00:07:03,531 --> 00:07:08,531
enough and I bought it for $3
million and I sold it for 4 million.

123
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:11,870
Isn't that a profit? Isn't that
a profit? What do you think?

124
00:07:11,871 --> 00:07:15,800
Isn't that a profit? Yeah, that
would be $1 million profit. Well,

125
00:07:15,801 --> 00:07:20,240
they said I sold it for two
less than two little, okay.

126
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:25,220
Who was this? There was somebody on
the internet. Okay. So, you know,

127
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:30,280
he'd be arguing in front of us with
perhaps a 18 year old guy on the internet

128
00:07:32,241 --> 00:07:35,600
who thought that Donald Trump should've
made more from a real estate deal.

129
00:07:35,660 --> 00:07:39,080
And this is something he really
concentrates on. He seems to,

130
00:07:39,530 --> 00:07:43,100
I'm still to this day, yeah. Obsessed
with what anybody says about him. Anytime.

131
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:48,140
It's so odd. And I thought, and I
want to say this very clearly, um,

132
00:07:48,590 --> 00:07:51,710
I thought he was wonderful
at his job. You know,

133
00:07:52,070 --> 00:07:56,840
if you had someone who was actually
a business person, I'm on that show,

134
00:07:57,050 --> 00:08:01,280
it would be the worst show in the world
because bill Gates would make proper

135
00:08:01,281 --> 00:08:04,130
decisions. Right? And
there'd be no surprises.

136
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:09,050
You want someone capricious and crazy,
but no filter. That's what you want.

137
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:13,370
Right? And that's what we got. So he
makes arbitrary decisions that you try,

138
00:08:13,371 --> 00:08:16,100
you know, the human brain tries
desperately to make those make sense.

139
00:08:16,310 --> 00:08:20,990
And that ends up being some kind of
entertainment. And, um, so I actually,

140
00:08:21,380 --> 00:08:23,990
uh, actually a Donald Trump jr said to me,

141
00:08:24,590 --> 00:08:26,210
and of all the people
we've had on this show,

142
00:08:26,211 --> 00:08:29,870
you seem like the only person
who's ever liked my father.

143
00:08:31,550 --> 00:08:33,950
He said, you actually seem to
like them. And I said, you know,

144
00:08:34,370 --> 00:08:39,220
I have a fascination and
to respect and a, um,

145
00:08:39,380 --> 00:08:44,030
affection for people who are
able to get out of their filters.

146
00:08:44,270 --> 00:08:49,010
And I said, some people do that
with pure genius, like Bob Dylan.

147
00:08:49,220 --> 00:08:52,250
Some people do it with
bravery, like Lenny Bruce.

148
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:57,240
Some people do it with drugs.
You know, Neil young, perhaps,

149
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:02,130
uh, Jimmy Hendrix perhaps, and most
people do it with a mixture of stuff.

150
00:09:02,460 --> 00:09:03,600
But I said, um,

151
00:09:03,930 --> 00:09:08,100
Thelonious monk said the genius is
the one who is most like himself.

152
00:09:08,460 --> 00:09:11,220
And I said with some sort of, um,

153
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:15,960
mental problems coupled with, um,

154
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:20,430
greed and a lack of compassion.

155
00:09:20,730 --> 00:09:24,660
Your father has somehow found
a way to throw off the filters.

156
00:09:24,810 --> 00:09:29,810
And I will listen to tiny Tim talk on
tape for hours because I liked that little

157
00:09:30,811 --> 00:09:33,400
bit of Asperger's and all
that other stuff. But, um, I,

158
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:38,450
I'm not assuming I'm not qualified
to do, but I'm saying this is auntie,

159
00:09:39,030 --> 00:09:41,430
I can hear him talk forever.
I can listen to Lenny Bruce.

160
00:09:41,431 --> 00:09:45,210
You know how we will never has those
hundreds hours of him just ranting on his

161
00:09:45,211 --> 00:09:49,590
tape. I think. I don't like people
on drugs that much, but boy I do.

162
00:09:49,890 --> 00:09:54,720
And I listened to a Lenny
Bruce talk forever and uh,

163
00:09:54,750 --> 00:09:58,310
Donald Trump had the dark
side of that. You know,

164
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:01,850
it was almost like when I was hitchhiking
around the country and you know,

165
00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:05,190
homeless and shit and you'd end
up at a biker place and you know,

166
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:08,580
some clubhouse and some guys
just holding court ranting.

167
00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:13,680
I've always been interested in the people
who were out on the margins, you know,

168
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:15,960
and what,

169
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:19,300
what Donald jr um,

170
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:23,220
took as affection I guess
was a bit of affection.

171
00:10:23,430 --> 00:10:28,230
But it's also that if you have thrown off
some filters, I'll listen to you talk.

172
00:10:29,430 --> 00:10:33,570
And um, so that was that. It was
very, very strange. And then, um,

173
00:10:34,020 --> 00:10:38,850
I really did spend a lot of time kind
of sticking up for Donald Trump saying,

174
00:10:39,090 --> 00:10:41,400
yeah, there's interesting
stuff there. And yeah, he's,

175
00:10:41,401 --> 00:10:46,260
he's crazy and he's venal
and, um, he's empty. Uh,

176
00:10:46,410 --> 00:10:50,040
you know, really weird stuff
that you've never seen before.

177
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:55,320
You have never seen someone who is
never laughed sincerely and never made a

178
00:10:55,321 --> 00:10:59,700
joke. Never laughed sincerely. No, he
will, he will laugh in a bully way.

179
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:04,680
He look kinda fat Joe. Yeah, he'll do
that. But he won't laugh at himself.

180
00:11:05,010 --> 00:11:08,910
Oh no. And also, but never a even a joke.

181
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:11,220
Even it says phrase on Twitter.

182
00:11:11,460 --> 00:11:13,830
Did you see the thing he did on Twitter
the other day where you put a picture of

183
00:11:13,831 --> 00:11:17,550
Trump tower in Greenland and he said,
I promised not to do this. Yeah. Yeah.

184
00:11:17,970 --> 00:11:20,220
I mean, I laughed. That was funny.

185
00:11:21,330 --> 00:11:25,380
Giant Trump tower in the middle of
Greenland. I never saw it. I mean,

186
00:11:25,381 --> 00:11:27,870
I saw that, but we never saw him in
person. I never saw him in person.

187
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:31,290
I also never saw him showing the
enjoyment or understanding of music.

188
00:11:32,790 --> 00:11:37,710
And those two things are two things
that I connect with people very much on.

189
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:41,790
I do too. But one of my best friends,
Doug Stanhope does not like music.

190
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:44,340
Oh yeah. Yeah. I know that
guys fucking hate music.

191
00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:49,470
And tell his father, really tell her
his father didn't like music. I mean,

192
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:52,560
I don't know mean and
aggressively did like abuse. Yeah.

193
00:11:52,561 --> 00:11:54,190
I don't know what that is, but

194
00:11:54,190 --> 00:11:58,480
I do know that I don't, I don't believe
that we see things the same way.

195
00:11:58,750 --> 00:12:00,940
Like I don't think we
taste things the same way,

196
00:12:00,941 --> 00:12:03,610
which is why some people enjoy certain
kinds of foods and some people hate those

197
00:12:03,611 --> 00:12:07,800
exact same foods that some people, the
music sounds different, if you will,

198
00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:09,010
in terms of like what,

199
00:12:09,250 --> 00:12:12,820
what their emotional and psychological
makeup is and what it does to them.

200
00:12:13,030 --> 00:12:15,550
Some people don't want to have
none of it and that's staying up.

201
00:12:15,580 --> 00:12:19,660
When I lost all that weight, you lost
over a hundred pounds. Congratulations.

202
00:12:19,661 --> 00:12:24,520
And I read a lot and also more
importantly for years and kept it up. But,

203
00:12:24,830 --> 00:12:27,640
um, uh, when I was reading about taste,

204
00:12:27,641 --> 00:12:32,380
I read this book and I know it's awful
that I can't bring up the name, but, um,

205
00:12:33,010 --> 00:12:35,170
woman wrote this wonderful book about, uh,

206
00:12:35,230 --> 00:12:39,640
preferences in food and she was
trying to set up a dichotomy.

207
00:12:39,670 --> 00:12:44,440
Let's talk to those people who think
there's a natural taste and desire in food

208
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:48,640
and those that think it's all environment
and what you in memory and so on,

209
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:51,910
and you just can't find
scientists on the other side.

210
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:57,360
All of our food preferences are
habit and there's nothing else habit.

211
00:12:58,150 --> 00:13:00,940
It's just habit. Is that
proven? How can they prove?

212
00:13:00,970 --> 00:13:05,710
Seems to be a lots of studies,
uh, with young children, um,

213
00:13:05,740 --> 00:13:10,300
lots of studies with people who they
control their body. But how do you make,

214
00:13:10,690 --> 00:13:13,840
how does it make sense when you have
two kids that have radically different

215
00:13:13,841 --> 00:13:17,140
tastes that grew up in the same
household and they have essentially very,

216
00:13:17,141 --> 00:13:21,370
very similar food experiences? Yeah. Well,
I don't know how they tease out that,

217
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:22,750
but they, I have one daughter,

218
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:25,660
one daughter who loves
spicy food and she's young.

219
00:13:25,661 --> 00:13:28,810
She's nine and I love spicy
food. Yeah. And, I mean,

220
00:13:28,811 --> 00:13:32,980
this fucking kid can eat jalapenos cause
he eats habanero sauce. She'll like,

221
00:13:32,981 --> 00:13:35,800
I'll say this one might be a little too
hot for you. She's like, let me try it.

222
00:13:36,130 --> 00:13:38,590
And she'll like dip her finger
in and she's like, put it on.

223
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:41,620
She'll eat chicken with habanero
sauce and she's a little Savage.

224
00:13:41,770 --> 00:13:44,740
My other one doesn't want to have
nothing to do with it. She did.

225
00:13:44,741 --> 00:13:47,980
She thinks everything's too hot. Like
a little bit of pepper. She's like, Oh,

226
00:13:47,981 --> 00:13:52,540
it's too hot. But you know, I,
I found when my, uh, when I,

227
00:13:52,541 --> 00:13:57,541
when I changed my diet so radically that
my comfort foods changed and my habits

228
00:13:58,061 --> 00:14:01,390
changed and what I liked Chino, a lot
of that is because of gut bacteria. Oh,

229
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:05,650
I know that. I know. Yeah. Micro-biome.
Fascinating. Really fascinating stuff.

230
00:14:05,740 --> 00:14:09,910
And seeding back to your brain, you
know, uh, that was the thing that was so,

231
00:14:10,180 --> 00:14:14,980
so strange because seeing your emotions.
Yes, very much so. But when I, uh,

232
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:18,340
I became plant based vegan, um,

233
00:14:18,910 --> 00:14:21,130
for health reasons and I wrote in my book,

234
00:14:21,190 --> 00:14:25,300
I wrote a lot of stuff about
I am an unethical vegan.

235
00:14:25,660 --> 00:14:29,350
I'm not doing this or any sort
of animal, any sort of animal,

236
00:14:29,351 --> 00:14:32,050
lack of animal cruelty,
nothing. Strictly health.

237
00:14:32,260 --> 00:14:34,360
That's why I'm doing the
plants and the story.

238
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:38,680
And this has happened to a lot of
friends of mine who changed that after

239
00:14:38,681 --> 00:14:41,710
whatever it takes. And people
are guessing like three months,

240
00:14:41,711 --> 00:14:46,690
four months of 'em have
no animal products. Uh,

241
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:51,720
those little critters eating shit and
you're in your guts dye that liked the

242
00:14:52,230 --> 00:14:54,950
meat stuff and they're not
giving that feedback loop.

243
00:14:54,951 --> 00:14:59,951
And I just found a real emotional
change where all of a sudden I went,

244
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:04,630
I don't want to be part of that.
I'm of the suffering. Yeah.

245
00:15:04,790 --> 00:15:09,370
It was really strange how that
changed and it really felt to me, uh,

246
00:15:10,670 --> 00:15:13,970
I was so want to, uh, I, you know,

247
00:15:14,330 --> 00:15:17,020
hardcore atheist as you know, and um,

248
00:15:17,060 --> 00:15:20,870
I don't believe in a mind
body separation at all.

249
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:26,320
And yet I seem to believe
that when I was 350 pounds,

250
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:30,530
that, um, none of that
affected my emotion.

251
00:15:31,190 --> 00:15:36,190
And then I lost all this weight and found
there were so many changes in me that

252
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:41,030
seem to be intellectual and emotional.

253
00:15:41,450 --> 00:15:44,990
And actually I had a lot
of evidence where physical,

254
00:15:45,350 --> 00:15:49,280
well put me up on the mind, body
separation should fuck you up

255
00:15:49,330 --> 00:15:53,680
because a lot of people make these
assumptions that you know you are not your

256
00:15:53,681 --> 00:15:55,780
body and a lot of very intelligent people,

257
00:15:56,050 --> 00:16:00,670
they issue working out and they don't
want to exercise and they find it like

258
00:16:00,671 --> 00:16:05,350
it's a vanity thing. It seems
egotistical. They don't,

259
00:16:05,380 --> 00:16:06,220
they don't like it.

260
00:16:06,310 --> 00:16:10,720
And so they put it in this category of
kind of knucklehead dumb things to do.

261
00:16:10,870 --> 00:16:14,470
But your body and your mind are
all in the same house. Yeah.

262
00:16:14,590 --> 00:16:17,050
If your house is filled
with shit, it doesn't help.

263
00:16:17,090 --> 00:16:19,550
And it was so amazing how,

264
00:16:19,610 --> 00:16:24,610
I mean I completely believe that
and yet I wasn't living there.

265
00:16:25,430 --> 00:16:27,920
I was like thinking that I
was living this, you know,

266
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:32,720
2000 year old idea of little homonculus
who's kind of living inside me,

267
00:16:32,721 --> 00:16:36,140
who's this pure pen and
then the body is just,

268
00:16:36,141 --> 00:16:39,230
the vehicle is driving around
it. That's just not true.

269
00:16:39,830 --> 00:16:42,290
BW with that. I think knowing
you as long as I've known you,

270
00:16:42,690 --> 00:16:44,780
you're an intense thinker and you,

271
00:16:44,781 --> 00:16:47,900
your mind is something you mean,

272
00:16:47,901 --> 00:16:51,950
you cherish your thoughts and
you, you embrace them and your,

273
00:16:51,951 --> 00:16:56,951
you're a very intelligent guy and I
think you just probably rejected the idea

274
00:16:57,860 --> 00:17:00,920
that there was anything outside of
the mind that had any influence.

275
00:17:01,340 --> 00:17:03,740
Yeah. We also talked about
this. I was also, you know,

276
00:17:03,741 --> 00:17:07,810
I was the biggest guy to ever go
through my school. So, uh, my,

277
00:17:07,811 --> 00:17:11,360
my small high school in
Western Massachusetts, you
know, so I was, I was six,

278
00:17:11,361 --> 00:17:14,930
seven and they wanted me as
center of the basketball team.

279
00:17:14,931 --> 00:17:18,860
They wanted all this stuff and those
kinds of people and that kind of culture,

280
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:21,500
you know, I wanted to listen to music,

281
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:26,270
I wanted to read and I set up
this, you guys who are physical,

282
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:29,120
I don't like you, I'm on a
different team. Yeah. You know,

283
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:34,240
and my dislike of competitions and
teams became a team thing. Yes.

284
00:17:35,070 --> 00:17:38,460
Yeah. That's the thing. You
always get stuck in the, the,

285
00:17:38,470 --> 00:17:40,760
the dislike of teams becomes your team.

286
00:17:41,180 --> 00:17:45,170
And I'm trying so hard now
to think I have two choices,

287
00:17:45,410 --> 00:17:49,770
one or 7 billion, and there's
no teams between that.

288
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:53,550
I can either be myself or I
can be one of all humanity,

289
00:17:53,820 --> 00:17:57,000
or I won't even say 7 billion,
let's say 108 billion.

290
00:17:57,001 --> 00:17:59,790
The number of people who have
lived in history, you know,

291
00:18:00,090 --> 00:18:03,030
those are the people I can be.
It's why I'm trying to not,

292
00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:05,160
and this is impossible to do by the way.

293
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:08,790
I'm talking about how I'm explaining to
you how I'm driving myself crazy, right?

294
00:18:08,850 --> 00:18:11,220
I'm not going to get real information. Um,

295
00:18:11,820 --> 00:18:14,790
I'm trying to not think
ever of us in them,

296
00:18:15,540 --> 00:18:18,210
but I'm trying to say those
of us who voted for Trump,

297
00:18:18,780 --> 00:18:23,460
those of us who believe this.
So it's always us because man,

298
00:18:23,650 --> 00:18:27,750
I'm so fucking sick of teams and
I even look back and go, you know,

299
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:31,770
I love the velvet underground.
I hated the fucking Eagles.

300
00:18:32,220 --> 00:18:37,020
And that was a fucking team. And that
was bidding [inaudible] at forced upon,

301
00:18:37,290 --> 00:18:40,740
you know what I mean? I wanted to be the
kind of guy that went from, you know,

302
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:45,750
Zappa, the velvet
underground to Bob Dylan.

303
00:18:45,751 --> 00:18:49,500
That was all okay. And the
Eagles and the Doobie brothers,

304
00:18:49,501 --> 00:18:53,100
they were not what I listened to.
I'm just trying to let that go. Yeah.

305
00:18:53,101 --> 00:18:55,650
You want it to be one of the
cool kids. Yeah, exactly. Yeah.

306
00:18:55,830 --> 00:18:58,470
And whenever you want that, you've
got to say, well, you don't,

307
00:18:58,471 --> 00:19:01,890
one of the cool kids that's the hundred
8 billion who've lived on this planet.

308
00:19:01,950 --> 00:19:05,160
Yeah. That's a great way to
look at things. And I think,

309
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:07,170
I wish people taught that in school.

310
00:19:07,230 --> 00:19:11,460
The dangers of being involved in teams
because we get involved in teams in terms

311
00:19:11,461 --> 00:19:13,800
of like, you know, you're playing
basketball or whatever, but,

312
00:19:13,830 --> 00:19:17,610
but teams in terms of like the what
I believe versus what you believe.

313
00:19:17,820 --> 00:19:20,550
And I think we're experiencing that
politically right now with the most

314
00:19:20,551 --> 00:19:24,450
polarizing time and in my
lifetime that I've ever,

315
00:19:24,451 --> 00:19:28,380
ever met worldwide. Yes.
Worldwide. I mean, it's, it is not,

316
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:31,480
it is not an American
thing. Right. And, uh,

317
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:35,860
it's just insane. And I also know,
that's why I said, you know, I,

318
00:19:35,861 --> 00:19:39,390
I try to go with the velvet underground
and the Eagles because that's where I

319
00:19:39,391 --> 00:19:42,780
can really see where I'm
wrong. You know that I'm wrong.

320
00:19:42,810 --> 00:19:46,950
How do you deny victim of love?
That's a great song, man. Okay.

321
00:19:46,980 --> 00:19:51,280
Once jokes in the mix, the
Eagle's changed. You know,
people have to recognize,

322
00:19:51,281 --> 00:19:54,910
I was in the middle of the
China's see with Joel Walsh, ah,

323
00:19:55,130 --> 00:19:59,160
through a series of odd coincidences.
Why don't I add, well, just a,

324
00:19:59,161 --> 00:20:03,810
just last year we got this gig, uh,
Paul Allen, who is one of the sure.

325
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:08,040
Microsoft guys. Sure, sure. Great guy.
Right. And he had great things about him.

326
00:20:08,070 --> 00:20:11,460
Books us to be on a cruise, uh,

327
00:20:11,490 --> 00:20:13,470
to do a show for his friends.

328
00:20:13,470 --> 00:20:16,950
He had like 200 friends and he's
bought this fucking cruise ship.

329
00:20:16,951 --> 00:20:20,490
He's rented this fucking cruise ship
thrown off all the chefs and everything.

330
00:20:20,491 --> 00:20:23,100
Bring on his own people and
they're going to go from,

331
00:20:23,490 --> 00:20:28,490
I'm from Kobe to Shanghai and he wants
the entertainment to be Jay Leno,

332
00:20:29,551 --> 00:20:32,370
Penn and teller and
Ringo Starr. Whoa, okay.

333
00:20:32,371 --> 00:20:34,260
That's what it's going
to be on the China sea,

334
00:20:34,261 --> 00:20:37,710
on a cruise boat for like
200 people. And he books it.

335
00:20:37,770 --> 00:20:41,430
And as I said to my friend,
Piff the magic dragon, I said,

336
00:20:41,431 --> 00:20:46,431
do you know how much it costs to shutdown
Penn and teller in Vegas and fly us

337
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:48,070
all to fucking

338
00:20:48,130 --> 00:20:52,840
Japan to beat on a cruise ship to do a
fucking Penn and teller show and then

339
00:20:52,841 --> 00:20:56,110
come back. Do you have any idea how
much that costs? And Piff said no.

340
00:20:56,111 --> 00:20:58,600
And I said, me, me either.
But it must be a lot.

341
00:20:58,990 --> 00:21:02,140
You gotta talk to my managers or something
cause that must've been a shit ton of

342
00:21:02,141 --> 00:21:06,310
money. So he books this whole thing
and then Paul Allen dies, right?

343
00:21:07,210 --> 00:21:09,520
Dies. So you know Glenn,
who you met out there,

344
00:21:09,521 --> 00:21:12,280
the long suffering Glen who our manager,

345
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:16,270
he calls up and after few days and says,

346
00:21:17,020 --> 00:21:22,020
really sorry for your loss and we'll
trade in the tickets and get you the money

347
00:21:22,391 --> 00:21:26,950
back and we can probably rebook those
those weeks or it's not going to cost

348
00:21:26,951 --> 00:21:31,350
anything. It's so sorry but them, no,
no, we're still doing it. And then goes,

349
00:21:31,470 --> 00:21:35,650
well, you're w w w the person
that booked us, his dad,

350
00:21:36,370 --> 00:21:41,140
we're still doing this gig. And
they go, Hey, yeah, we went, okay.

351
00:21:41,350 --> 00:21:44,260
And I said to Glen, do you know now
that we could work for dead people,

352
00:21:44,620 --> 00:21:49,450
our careers going to take off, you know,
cause that opens up the market. Right,

353
00:21:49,490 --> 00:21:53,830
right. Um, so turns out
that his friends, you know,

354
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:58,990
Paul Allen's friends are people like Joel
Walsh and Billy Gibbons and all these

355
00:21:58,991 --> 00:22:01,090
food scientists and
all these great people.

356
00:22:01,180 --> 00:22:05,650
So there I am in the middle
of the China's sea with, um,

357
00:22:05,950 --> 00:22:08,530
with a Joe Walsh onstage,

358
00:22:08,620 --> 00:22:13,620
just in three in the morning playing
piano for like 15 people and you know,

359
00:22:13,750 --> 00:22:18,010
singing Desperado and those kinds of
things and talking to Joe Walsh and stuff

360
00:22:18,011 --> 00:22:22,390
and going, now, why exactly was I
on a different team from Joe Walsh?

361
00:22:22,690 --> 00:22:26,440
Why exactly was I on the Lou Reed
team instead of the Joe Walsh team?

362
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:30,510
They knows the big Lebowski influenced
you. Maybe, maybe, maybe it was there,

363
00:22:30,790 --> 00:22:32,130
but it's, it's just, um,

364
00:22:32,310 --> 00:22:37,310
it's just trying to be more and more
inclusive is just a really difficult thing

365
00:22:37,511 --> 00:22:41,950
to do. Whether it's the, and the
music guys are all that stuff,

366
00:22:41,951 --> 00:22:43,240
just everybody be everybody.

367
00:22:43,390 --> 00:22:46,090
You can become a prisoner
of those thoughts and those,

368
00:22:46,091 --> 00:22:49,630
those things as you espouse. Like
when you start saying fuck the Eagles,

369
00:22:49,631 --> 00:22:51,910
like you're stuck, you're
stuck with fuck the Eagles.

370
00:22:52,300 --> 00:22:54,820
And then when you start
to realize that, you know,

371
00:22:54,821 --> 00:22:59,821
when the clash was hitting in the U S
there were people sitting around a board

372
00:23:00,571 --> 00:23:04,010
room going, how do we get 20 year
old assholes to buy this shit? Right?

373
00:23:04,930 --> 00:23:07,900
It was all being done and
laid out and that's fine.

374
00:23:07,901 --> 00:23:10,300
That's their job and that's
great and God bless him,

375
00:23:10,540 --> 00:23:13,780
but I got to be aware that
they're doing that. Yeah, I know.

376
00:23:13,870 --> 00:23:16,870
When you think about someone's selling
sex pistols merchandise, just like,

377
00:23:17,350 --> 00:23:20,870
well there's sex pistol slump, sorry,
there's sex pistol slot machine.

378
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:25,600
When I was first in the hard rock,
you know, and there's a big side,

379
00:23:25,750 --> 00:23:28,960
the only notes that really count
are the ones that come in wads,

380
00:23:29,170 --> 00:23:33,100
and that's over the door of a
casino that you're walking in.

381
00:23:33,250 --> 00:23:37,930
And then there's a Sid
vicious slot machine and you
go, okay, okay, so this is,

382
00:23:38,410 --> 00:23:43,240
you know, sat tires, debt. We can no
longer do satire. That's over. Well,

383
00:23:43,241 --> 00:23:46,150
it's hard to do attire to this
dot. Oh, never liked it. I

384
00:23:46,170 --> 00:23:50,180
never worked really hard because there's
so many people that are serious that

385
00:23:50,181 --> 00:23:54,290
are more ridiculous than satire. There's
a guy who, I don't know his real name,

386
00:23:54,291 --> 00:23:56,690
but his, his Twitter
name is Tatyana McGrath,

387
00:23:57,110 --> 00:23:59,870
and he plays like the most
woke person in all of Twitter.

388
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:03,100
And I retweet his stuff or her stuff, the,

389
00:24:03,230 --> 00:24:07,970
the pseudonym all the time. And people
get furious. They're like, Oh my God,

390
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:11,090
is this fucking person serious?
Like this is bullshit. And I'm like,

391
00:24:11,091 --> 00:24:15,050
it's parody. And they're like, Oh.
And they go, okay, I get it. I'm like,

392
00:24:15,051 --> 00:24:19,280
it's that close. It's that close to
being a real person, but not close.

393
00:24:19,281 --> 00:24:23,380
We've already crossed over. Oh yeah,
absolutely. There's no way to tell. No,

394
00:24:23,390 --> 00:24:27,140
there's no way to, well, with woke
people with the, with the woke young,

395
00:24:27,390 --> 00:24:30,020
they're still wouldn't tell with you,
with anybody far writings. Well, yeah.

396
00:24:30,380 --> 00:24:34,790
Anything, yeah. There's no way to tell
with any of us or so. But I never, ever,

397
00:24:34,970 --> 00:24:38,120
ever liked satire. I
never, ever liked parody,

398
00:24:38,150 --> 00:24:40,850
even when I was reading national Lampoon

399
00:24:43,870 --> 00:24:48,260
on the onion. How about that? Is that
a turnaround fast enough for you?

400
00:24:48,261 --> 00:24:52,610
The onion is too good. When the onion
did the headline, when Steve jobs died,

401
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:55,480
which said a nation, uh,

402
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:59,040
mourns the loss of the last person
to do what the fuck you was doing,

403
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:07,250
I went, ah, that's perfect. But
you know, I, I, I saw that post. Do

404
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:09,720
you have up? Yeah. About
here in your, uh, which one?

405
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:12,960
The Lenny Bruce without tears.
Oh yeah. Yeah. And you know,

406
00:25:12,961 --> 00:25:17,100
the idea of walking, I
mean, and I looked, I was,

407
00:25:17,101 --> 00:25:19,340
I was whatever. I was, uh,

408
00:25:20,130 --> 00:25:24,930
10 or 11 when Lenny Bruce
died. And, um, but you know,

409
00:25:24,931 --> 00:25:28,620
I, I didn't ever hear him until after
he was dead. And you're younger than me,

410
00:25:28,621 --> 00:25:33,480
so even more so for you. But I, um,
I did not go to college, but I, uh,

411
00:25:33,540 --> 00:25:37,050
I would hitchhike up to the college that
was nearby when I was in high school,

412
00:25:37,051 --> 00:25:41,090
which was UMass and all
that. And yeah. And, uh,

413
00:25:41,130 --> 00:25:45,070
cause I'm from little dead factory
town North of there. And, uh,

414
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:50,400
I remember seeing, uh, Lenny Bruce
without tears. They showed that as a film.

415
00:25:50,490 --> 00:25:55,260
Oh wow. I'm a college campus. Wow. Uh,
I think I'm remembering this right.

416
00:25:55,261 --> 00:25:56,730
Like we know our memories are wrong,

417
00:25:56,731 --> 00:26:01,020
but I saw the film very
early and it was, uh,

418
00:26:01,050 --> 00:26:03,570
completely life changing
for me. You know, um,

419
00:26:03,810 --> 00:26:08,810
the idea that stand up comedy was going
to go from [inaudible] to me was the

420
00:26:10,891 --> 00:26:14,340
Smothers brothers, uh, to, um,

421
00:26:14,820 --> 00:26:19,820
to somebody actually talking
from their heart in a way that,

422
00:26:20,460 --> 00:26:22,830
uh, made people laugh, but
who cared. And of course,

423
00:26:23,070 --> 00:26:26,670
then Andy Kaufman turns
that entirely inside out.

424
00:26:26,850 --> 00:26:31,680
But the idea that that form
was created, you know, um,

425
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:36,330
created here in the U S when
you went from being a, you know,

426
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:38,910
a park, a carcass, you
know, Albert Brooks,

427
00:26:39,150 --> 00:26:43,980
his father doing the Greek dialect and
even throw in Amos and Andy and all

428
00:26:43,980 --> 00:26:47,430
of those people that did joke,
joke, jokes and character stuff.

429
00:26:47,670 --> 00:26:52,670
And then all of a sudden the guy coming
out as himself and talking about his

430
00:26:52,801 --> 00:26:55,410
real life was just mind blowing to me.

431
00:26:55,710 --> 00:26:59,730
And so the idea that
instead of doing parody,

432
00:27:00,030 --> 00:27:03,570
being able to get your laughs,
stating what you believe,

433
00:27:03,780 --> 00:27:07,650
and maybe that means people are
laughing at you and maybe that's okay.

434
00:27:08,340 --> 00:27:10,290
It's definitely okay. Um,

435
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:12,690
but I don't think there's anything
wrong with any way to do it.

436
00:27:12,750 --> 00:27:15,810
I think there's nothing wrong with Abbott
and Costello. You know what I mean?

437
00:27:16,050 --> 00:27:18,780
It's, I was having a talk
with Gilbert, you know,

438
00:27:18,810 --> 00:27:22,620
Gilbert Gottfried and we were talking,
he said, you know, and in the, um,

439
00:27:22,950 --> 00:27:27,630
in Laurel and Hardy stand, Laurel was
the brains. And then the three Stooges,

440
00:27:28,260 --> 00:27:31,650
Moe was the brains. And in the Marx
brothers, Groucho was the braids.

441
00:27:31,651 --> 00:27:34,460
And dabbin. Costello had no brains.

442
00:27:35,870 --> 00:27:40,230
You know that total you want to talk
about the Stooges began archi? Yeah,

443
00:27:40,290 --> 00:27:45,000
the Abbott and Costello or just
completely off the map. Yeah,

444
00:27:45,090 --> 00:27:48,340
just really for the time though,
it was groundbreaking. We,

445
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:52,710
it's hard for us to wrap our head around
as was Cheech and Chong, you know,

446
00:27:52,711 --> 00:27:55,050
Cheech and Chong for the
time was groundbreaking.

447
00:27:55,051 --> 00:27:58,510
I know that has to do with
drugs and that for me, for me,

448
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:01,400
I was on a different team at that time,

449
00:28:01,770 --> 00:28:04,350
but I've gone back and that
stuff is good and of course,

450
00:28:04,620 --> 00:28:09,620
but I'm also a liar because I was crazy
for Firesign theater and memorizing

451
00:28:10,291 --> 00:28:12,480
everything and feel Proctor's still up.

452
00:28:12,590 --> 00:28:17,430
A good friend of mine and
that was very much drug base.

453
00:28:17,790 --> 00:28:22,140
I think that comedy is like music in
that there's a whole bunch of different

454
00:28:22,141 --> 00:28:23,130
ways to do it. You know,

455
00:28:23,131 --> 00:28:28,131
and if you were a big fan of Bruce
Springsteen and you went to see Bruce

456
00:28:28,260 --> 00:28:31,230
Springsteen, but run DMC showed up
instead, you'd be furious if you're like,

457
00:28:31,231 --> 00:28:35,400
what the fuck is this? But
obviously people love run DMC.

458
00:28:35,401 --> 00:28:38,900
It's a different way to do a thing. It's
a different way to express just and,

459
00:28:38,901 --> 00:28:42,480
and, and, and a way to learn.
Yeah. No way to learn when you get,

460
00:28:42,481 --> 00:28:46,770
when you get pushed out of there.
But it's, it's just, uh, uh,

461
00:28:47,070 --> 00:28:51,960
that, that whole idea that
you've got to, um, this, I mean,

462
00:28:51,990 --> 00:28:56,490
my life is so heavily affected by drugs,

463
00:28:56,820 --> 00:29:00,020
even though I had this
whole, you know, I, uh,

464
00:29:00,150 --> 00:29:03,490
I'm not gonna do any drugs. Why did
you have that decision? You know,

465
00:29:03,510 --> 00:29:05,790
I don't know. I don't know. That's always,

466
00:29:06,030 --> 00:29:09,870
and I've talked about this on my
podcast forever, you know, I tell him,

467
00:29:10,530 --> 00:29:12,480
how old are you now? I'm 64 years old.

468
00:29:12,510 --> 00:29:16,900
And you have no experience with drugs
other than gun medication, surgery? Sure.

469
00:29:16,901 --> 00:29:18,240
I mean, yes. And I have,

470
00:29:18,241 --> 00:29:21,690
I've had a deep enough injuries
that I have experienced.

471
00:29:21,690 --> 00:29:26,340
Keep getting surgery cause you love
drugs. Excuse. Well, you know, uh,

472
00:29:26,370 --> 00:29:28,140
Trey Parker, um,

473
00:29:28,830 --> 00:29:33,240
said that my big flaw was never
having been high so we can fix that.

474
00:29:33,540 --> 00:29:37,710
So I know. So he did fix that.
I went in for dental surgery,

475
00:29:38,490 --> 00:29:42,790
serious dental surgery, and
they fucked up. And the, uh,

476
00:29:42,791 --> 00:29:47,791
the dentist told the nurse what he had
given me in terms of painkillers and she

477
00:29:49,211 --> 00:29:52,330
took that as what she
was supposed to give me,

478
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:58,080
so instantly doubled the dose and I
was so fucking high and out of my mind.

479
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:00,660
People can die that way. Yeah.

480
00:30:01,060 --> 00:30:06,060
And I told my wife through my Hayes
of not knowing who I was called,

481
00:30:06,511 --> 00:30:10,870
Trey Parker drag came to Vegas and said,

482
00:30:11,080 --> 00:30:15,460
I want to sit with Penn high. So he
flew in while you were fucked up.

483
00:30:15,970 --> 00:30:19,050
Oh my God. How long did it take
him to get to you? We, we, he was,

484
00:30:19,051 --> 00:30:23,320
he was planning on being there like, he
came like a day early. Oh. So he got,

485
00:30:23,321 --> 00:30:27,790
he got there like I was still high and
Trey said I didn't remember anything and

486
00:30:27,791 --> 00:30:32,710
traced out the next day. I was
right. You should be high. Well,

487
00:30:32,740 --> 00:30:35,860
there's different kinds of high, like
there's different kinds of music.

488
00:30:35,861 --> 00:30:37,720
And you know, I was very, I was very, uh,

489
00:30:37,721 --> 00:30:41,950
I was very close to Lou Reed and I was a
very good friend of mine. And Lou said,

490
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:46,300
speaking on behalf of the people of earth,

491
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:50,560
which I often do. We don't want to see
ya. I'm a motherfucker, don't do it.

492
00:30:51,190 --> 00:30:54,490
So Lou says no, Trey says
she has, what does Joe say?

493
00:30:54,910 --> 00:30:58,060
Well Joe is interesting cause I wanted
to talk to you about this cause we had a

494
00:30:58,061 --> 00:31:01,360
conversation a long time ago
about this and you said that I,

495
00:31:01,550 --> 00:31:04,870
and I'll remember this very clearly,
I may paraphrase this, but you said,

496
00:31:05,140 --> 00:31:10,060
I think we've learned all there is to
know and I don't need to do it. Oh yes,

497
00:31:10,090 --> 00:31:12,670
I said that and I was wrong. Yeah. Yeah.

498
00:31:13,130 --> 00:31:16,960
Well I think you should
experience psychedelics cause
I don't think psychedelics

499
00:31:16,961 --> 00:31:20,680
are a totally different thing. They
don't take, you know, Sam Harris. Sure.

500
00:31:20,740 --> 00:31:24,340
And Sam Harris is the one who
got me meditating. Awesome.

501
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:28,630
Which took him a years of arguing with me.

502
00:31:28,870 --> 00:31:33,460
And now it's been three or four years
that I have not missed a day, not Mr. Day.

503
00:31:33,790 --> 00:31:36,280
You, uh, you have a problem.
Here's one of your problems.

504
00:31:36,310 --> 00:31:41,110
You're very intelligent. You're also
very large and you're very articulate.

505
00:31:41,170 --> 00:31:45,630
And people like to hear you talk. So
you just can talk and you can take over,

506
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:48,670
you could overrun things, and you can
make an argument that people just go,

507
00:31:48,770 --> 00:31:51,430
all right, okay. And they stepped back.

508
00:31:51,520 --> 00:31:54,430
And that's good if you're
trying to win an argument,

509
00:31:54,431 --> 00:31:56,350
but sometimes it's bad to take an ideas.

510
00:31:56,380 --> 00:31:58,990
And I remember when I had that
conference exactly right. Thank you.

511
00:31:59,020 --> 00:32:00,670
When I had that conversation
with you, I remember saying,

512
00:32:00,910 --> 00:32:04,390
I'm going to revisit this someday and
one day I want to get pen fucked up on

513
00:32:04,391 --> 00:32:08,050
mushrooms. That's what I remember thinking
like it might be a good thing for,

514
00:32:08,380 --> 00:32:12,340
well, the best thing for you would be
something that doesn't take very long,

515
00:32:12,370 --> 00:32:16,030
just so you can expect like DMT is the
best one because it takes like 15 minutes

516
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:19,810
and it's over, and then your body brings
it back to baseline almost immediately.

517
00:32:19,930 --> 00:32:23,140
So you literally traveled to another
dimension and then you're back and you

518
00:32:23,141 --> 00:32:26,500
don't have to worry about any overdosing
because it's an indogenous chemical.

519
00:32:26,620 --> 00:32:28,210
Your body knows exactly
what to do with it.

520
00:32:28,450 --> 00:32:32,140
So one of the quickest chemicals that
your body can break down and bring back to

521
00:32:32,141 --> 00:32:36,230
baseline in, in my defense, uh,

522
00:32:36,460 --> 00:32:40,640
from the very beginning
of my not doing drugs, um,

523
00:32:40,670 --> 00:32:45,140
which is an odd, odd kind of
a kind of baseline there. Um,

524
00:32:45,950 --> 00:32:49,370
I always left the door open for, um,

525
00:32:49,550 --> 00:32:51,410
for psychedelics and what I,

526
00:32:51,500 --> 00:32:55,580
what I disliked the most was
wine with dinner. Really.

527
00:32:55,581 --> 00:33:00,390
I disliked the most social kind
of lubrication, wine with dinner.

528
00:33:00,430 --> 00:33:05,030
Amazing. Doing this in past tense, you
know, that's, that's right. That's right.

529
00:33:05,060 --> 00:33:10,010
That's where I always was and I always
left open the possibility of some of the

530
00:33:10,011 --> 00:33:14,360
more intense stuff. Wine with
dinner is a delicious drug.

531
00:33:14,390 --> 00:33:17,300
It's one of the rare delicious
trucks. Like, I like whiskey,

532
00:33:17,301 --> 00:33:21,350
but let's be honest, it tastes like shit.
It's weird. You're drinking is tough.

533
00:33:21,550 --> 00:33:26,070
Like, whew. Like it's got kind of a
good flavor, but it's like, it's harsh.

534
00:33:26,180 --> 00:33:28,400
She can't drink it. Like,
it can't fuck with Koolaid.

535
00:33:28,401 --> 00:33:32,000
Kool-Aid tastes way better than
whiskey, right? Koolaid. It's cheap.

536
00:33:32,180 --> 00:33:35,780
He doesn't mix it up. It tastes
delicious. It's way better tasting.

537
00:33:36,230 --> 00:33:41,180
But you know, wine has a delicious
tastes that you can enjoy.

538
00:33:41,210 --> 00:33:46,080
Here's my problem. One of
my many problems, we'll
detail more than one. Okay?

539
00:33:46,190 --> 00:33:50,480
But I have no skill at moderation.

540
00:33:50,900 --> 00:33:55,900
I'm 64 years old and I've never been
able to do anything with moderation.

541
00:33:57,080 --> 00:34:02,080
So I think if you told me we're gonna
do acid for the rest of our lives every

542
00:34:02,360 --> 00:34:05,960
single day, you could make that
argument. The idea for me, that's hard.

543
00:34:05,961 --> 00:34:09,290
Like I said, but I said I was
meditated. I haven't missed a day.

544
00:34:09,470 --> 00:34:11,730
Maybe you should microdose
yeah, maybe. Yeah,

545
00:34:12,350 --> 00:34:15,080
we could give you a little right
now. Just a little spray. You do.

546
00:34:15,730 --> 00:34:17,470
Microdosing just raise
how I gonna do it now.

547
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:19,330
Now I want to think about
it a little bit before,

548
00:34:19,510 --> 00:34:20,900
although it would be pretty boss,

549
00:34:24,530 --> 00:34:26,990
tell me why and I'll open the
box. You get the box right there.

550
00:34:26,991 --> 00:34:30,530
I got a box right here. Yep. So, um, how
often do you see, Oh, I was going to,

551
00:34:30,531 --> 00:34:32,180
I was going to answer that question.

552
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:37,250
I have a zillion answers to why I've
never done drugs and none of them are of

553
00:34:37,251 --> 00:34:41,270
course true cause we don't have access
to that stuff that we really do.

554
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:46,480
But my parents and my whole family and
back generations teetotallers so there

555
00:34:46,971 --> 00:34:49,820
was never alcohol in the house ever.

556
00:34:50,030 --> 00:34:53,870
I never saw my parents take
a drink when it was on TV.

557
00:34:53,871 --> 00:34:57,260
It was a totally different thing. It
just didn't happen. I didn't have any,

558
00:34:57,440 --> 00:34:59,840
they never preached about it.
They never said don't drink.

559
00:34:59,841 --> 00:35:02,780
They never said don't do drugs.
It just never was in the house.

560
00:35:03,050 --> 00:35:05,990
And that statistically has
a huge effect on people.

561
00:35:06,410 --> 00:35:11,000
And then the first people
I fell madly in love with,

562
00:35:11,060 --> 00:35:15,050
you know, uh, Lenny
Bruce, Jimmy Hendrix, um,

563
00:35:15,560 --> 00:35:20,030
had been in my mind killed
by drugs and I kind of said,

564
00:35:20,300 --> 00:35:23,810
Oh people would that have this kind of
personality when they get into drugs,

565
00:35:23,811 --> 00:35:25,130
they sometimes have trouble.

566
00:35:25,490 --> 00:35:30,380
And I think that maybe being 19 years
old and trying to get into show business

567
00:35:30,530 --> 00:35:34,760
that may be being the sober one allowed
the dumber guy to do a little better,

568
00:35:34,790 --> 00:35:38,100
you know, is everybody else kinda get
out of my way? They were fucked up

569
00:35:38,100 --> 00:35:38,933
some of the time.

570
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:43,590
I could get other stuff done and then
that starts reinforcing that may no longer

571
00:35:43,591 --> 00:35:45,420
be valid. Well there are drugs.

572
00:35:45,450 --> 00:35:48,210
I mean I've never done Coke and one
of the reasons why I never did Coke,

573
00:35:48,211 --> 00:35:50,310
and I've talked about this many
times, my friend growing up,

574
00:35:50,311 --> 00:35:52,830
his cousin used to sell it and
I watched his life fall apart.

575
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:55,830
They were just doing Coke all the time
and lost a lot of weight and looks like a

576
00:35:55,831 --> 00:35:58,830
vampire. It was very strange to
just hung out in their attic.

577
00:35:58,831 --> 00:36:02,700
Apartment is really weird. And I
remember thinking, fuck Coke. It's like,

578
00:36:03,120 --> 00:36:05,730
like a guy I know got bit
by a monster, you know,

579
00:36:05,731 --> 00:36:10,530
and was infected with something. The
people, the people that I've been on Coke,

580
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:14,850
not pleasant, not good. It's not. I
don't, and I think that's also, you know,

581
00:36:14,851 --> 00:36:18,310
one of the accusations against Trump that
he's on some sort of speed, you know,

582
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:21,420
which is why he's so
inexhaustible, you know?

583
00:36:21,420 --> 00:36:26,420
And also why he has this inability to be
affected by criticism in terms of like

584
00:36:26,941 --> 00:36:31,290
he doesn't, there's no self reflection,
no shame, no shame, no self reflection.

585
00:36:31,291 --> 00:36:34,950
And that's something that is a symptom
of people that are on speed. You know,

586
00:36:34,951 --> 00:36:37,980
and this is the Adderall generation
that we're living in. God damn,

587
00:36:37,981 --> 00:36:40,950
there's so many fucking people that
are on Adderall. I mean it's so,

588
00:36:40,980 --> 00:36:42,690
it's so goddamn common. You know,

589
00:36:42,691 --> 00:36:47,070
I was having this conversation the other
day and someone was telling me about

590
00:36:47,071 --> 00:36:49,050
this guy that they know
who's really brilliant,

591
00:36:49,051 --> 00:36:52,890
but he won't stop til he's
got ADHD and you know,

592
00:36:52,891 --> 00:36:55,770
he just can't stop and he won't stop
talking and this and that. I'm waiting.

593
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:59,190
I'm just waiting while this person's
talking to me. I'll go, he's on Adderall.

594
00:36:59,940 --> 00:37:03,600
And they go, yeah, he is. It's a
medication. I go into their [inaudible],

595
00:37:04,020 --> 00:37:06,900
it's fucking speed. That
guy's on speed. Okay.

596
00:37:06,901 --> 00:37:09,930
And you can call it a medication
because you can buy it at the pharmacy.

597
00:37:10,050 --> 00:37:12,750
But that fucking guy's on
speed all day long, every day.

598
00:37:12,870 --> 00:37:17,870
And there is a giant number of people
in this country that are medicated and

599
00:37:18,181 --> 00:37:22,170
that are on speed all the time.
It's a great Andy Warhol quote,

600
00:37:22,230 --> 00:37:24,750
which was in the 60s we thought
we're getting to know people,

601
00:37:24,751 --> 00:37:28,190
but we were getting to know
drugs. Uh, you know there's there,

602
00:37:28,191 --> 00:37:29,340
there is definitely,

603
00:37:29,370 --> 00:37:34,170
there is definitely a personality type
that we think is an individual that

604
00:37:34,171 --> 00:37:38,190
actually does seem to have a tie in
with its fucking Adderall mindset.

605
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:43,080
There's a speed mindset and it's a go,
go, go get everything done more, bigger,

606
00:37:43,081 --> 00:37:46,200
faster, accumulate shit.
I'm the fucking man.

607
00:37:46,350 --> 00:37:49,830
I'm the fucking man like
that. That's a speed mindset.

608
00:37:50,310 --> 00:37:52,680
It's a dangerous mindset.
It's a real weird one.

609
00:37:52,681 --> 00:37:56,250
And it's not one that laughs at itself.
It's not one that's self deprecates.

610
00:37:56,251 --> 00:38:01,170
It's all me, me, me, me, me. I'm the shit.
And that's what you get out of Trump.

611
00:38:01,260 --> 00:38:02,610
I mean, this is, I mean,

612
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:06,930
there's a guy who was in a journalist
who wrote a story about how he knows the

613
00:38:06,931 --> 00:38:11,250
very Dwayne Reed pharmacy in Manhattan
where Trump was getting diet pills way

614
00:38:11,251 --> 00:38:13,590
back in the day. We were supposed
to take it for like six weeks.

615
00:38:13,591 --> 00:38:16,650
He took it for years and
this guy is saying like,

616
00:38:16,651 --> 00:38:17,820
this is what you're dealing with.

617
00:38:17,821 --> 00:38:22,000
Like many people have called him the
Adderall president, like this is it.

618
00:38:22,230 --> 00:38:27,230
It absolutely could be that he's on
something that all the we're talking about

619
00:38:28,170 --> 00:38:31,440
this whole time is just
speed. Yeah. Yeah. I mean,

620
00:38:31,441 --> 00:38:32,970
and it gives them the energy to look.

621
00:38:32,971 --> 00:38:34,500
Remember when he was running
for president? I'm like,

622
00:38:34,501 --> 00:38:38,350
how the fuck is this guy not tired? I
get tired if I tour and do stand up.

623
00:38:38,740 --> 00:38:40,570
When I do stand up, it's an hour,

624
00:38:40,780 --> 00:38:43,750
20 minutes of my own routine
that I've wrote myself.

625
00:38:43,751 --> 00:38:46,660
I'm hanging out with friends. I do
two shows a night and I'm like, whew.

626
00:38:46,780 --> 00:38:50,350
This motherfucker's touring, flying
around in jets all over the country,

627
00:38:50,590 --> 00:38:53,380
just in exhausted. Just no fucking script.

628
00:38:53,381 --> 00:38:55,060
Just goes on stage in front of everybody.

629
00:38:55,061 --> 00:38:58,490
Just ranted and raved about China
and the economy and build wall. Well,

630
00:38:58,570 --> 00:38:58,811
all right,

631
00:38:58,811 --> 00:39:01,840
we're going to go to Ohio and then off
to the jet eating Kentucky fried chicken

632
00:39:01,841 --> 00:39:05,110
and fucking flies in Ohio.
And he does it again. I mean,

633
00:39:05,230 --> 00:39:09,100
who the fuck at 70 has that
kind of energy people on speed?

634
00:39:10,390 --> 00:39:13,030
I don't know if it's true. I
might be wrong, I might be wrong,

635
00:39:13,290 --> 00:39:14,560
but it seems like it,

636
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:18,460
it seems like all the pieces are in
place and there was a psychologist is,

637
00:39:18,610 --> 00:39:22,840
did an analysis of all the
various psychological, um,

638
00:39:23,020 --> 00:39:25,630
traits that people who
are on in fed amines have.

639
00:39:25,930 --> 00:39:30,520
And they compared it to Trump and like
all of them megalomania all over the

640
00:39:30,610 --> 00:39:35,110
various psychological characteristics,
inability to accept criticism. You know,

641
00:39:35,350 --> 00:39:37,870
this thinking that everyone's
against them. This, the, the, this,

642
00:39:38,110 --> 00:39:40,810
this delusions of grandeur,
all these different,

643
00:39:41,090 --> 00:39:44,950
thanks. What was, there was a
guy on, uh, on, uh, there was,

644
00:39:44,980 --> 00:39:49,240
there was on apprentice who talked
about him, uh, him doing these,

645
00:39:49,270 --> 00:39:52,240
these kinds of drugs. There was
a news story. It was like a,

646
00:39:52,330 --> 00:39:54,590
it was like an intern that
we weren't going to, uh,

647
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:59,410
w w just kinda faded away after
that. But I, it's a, a, it's a,

648
00:39:59,411 --> 00:40:01,070
it's a nutty a, it's a nutty thing.

649
00:40:01,090 --> 00:40:05,320
Tom Arnold claims Donald Trump's snorted
Adderall and the apprentice set. Okay,

650
00:40:05,321 --> 00:40:09,970
well I know Tom, he's crazy. I
love you Tom. But I don't know.

651
00:40:10,410 --> 00:40:11,720
Yeah, maybe he did, but mate,

652
00:40:11,730 --> 00:40:15,880
Tom Arnold would say that he snorted
Trump or snorted a Coke just to piss Trump

653
00:40:15,881 --> 00:40:18,310
off. He would say that just
cause I'm fucking with him.

654
00:40:18,390 --> 00:40:22,690
I'm getting under his skin. Maybe
did snort Adderall. I don't know.

655
00:40:23,050 --> 00:40:26,260
I don't know. It doesn't seem like he,

656
00:40:26,360 --> 00:40:28,930
that it's the kind of
thing he would snore it.

657
00:40:28,931 --> 00:40:32,650
It seemed like he would pretend that
it was medicinal. Yeah. He take a pill.

658
00:40:32,950 --> 00:40:35,620
Yeah. I mean it's kind of
medicinal. Here's the thing,

659
00:40:35,830 --> 00:40:37,840
it will allow you to get
more things done. You know,

660
00:40:37,841 --> 00:40:40,540
we had a guy in here wrote a
book on Hunter Thompson and

661
00:40:40,740 --> 00:40:40,780
uh,

662
00:40:40,780 --> 00:40:43,630
one of the things that he's talking about
was that he needs Adderall to right.

663
00:40:43,690 --> 00:40:47,080
And I was going into it with him because
one of the things that dirty little

664
00:40:47,081 --> 00:40:51,040
secret about journalism is a tremendous
amount of journalists are on Adderall.

665
00:40:51,170 --> 00:40:54,830
Tremendous amount. Like an enormous
amount. Like one of my friends who's a,

666
00:40:54,831 --> 00:40:55,600
a pretty rigid,

667
00:40:55,600 --> 00:41:00,250
do we know how much Adderall
is going into the USA?

668
00:41:00,490 --> 00:41:01,323
That's a good question.

669
00:41:01,360 --> 00:41:06,360
How many Adderall prescriptions
were made in 2018?

670
00:41:06,731 --> 00:41:07,980
Let's just find that out. Um,

671
00:41:08,080 --> 00:41:12,400
but my friend who was a legit journalist
for legit publication said you would be

672
00:41:12,401 --> 00:41:16,450
stunned. And he goes, he goes, it's
an enormous percentage. The majority,

673
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:19,990
they just started banging it out
too. I mean, like they did with, um,

674
00:41:20,440 --> 00:41:23,290
with the fentanyl, the vets to children.

675
00:41:23,350 --> 00:41:28,180
They just bang out Adderall under
and a what's the other one? Prozac.

676
00:41:28,390 --> 00:41:31,150
No, the other one they do
for, I guess for it, for, um,

677
00:41:31,480 --> 00:41:34,100
attention to fish deficit
disorder is another one. Other

678
00:41:34,100 --> 00:41:38,570
than Adderall was, I'll just Adderall
maybe. Prozac. Adderall. I know Prozac.

679
00:41:38,630 --> 00:41:42,710
Prozac was, they put my neighbor's
kid on Prozac was fucking horrific.

680
00:41:42,980 --> 00:41:46,850
Seems low. 16 million adults
are prescriptions refilled.

681
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:51,710
16 million adults had prescriptions
filled. That's low thousand abuse it,

682
00:41:51,711 --> 00:41:56,630
which seems low also. So 16 million.
Yeah. What does that like 3% yeah.

683
00:41:56,930 --> 00:42:01,010
Yeah. That seems low. Less than
four 4% something like that.

684
00:42:03,530 --> 00:42:08,360
I don't know. It seems very low. That
was last year. Did 2012 is the last, Oh,

685
00:42:08,361 --> 00:42:13,280
2012 I couldn't find any, but that's
a million years ago showing up.

686
00:42:13,550 --> 00:42:17,330
Maybe that was true for 2012 I think it
probably was true for 2012 I think we

687
00:42:17,331 --> 00:42:22,160
live in a whole new world now and I
don't think it's anywhere near 4% or 5%

688
00:42:22,161 --> 00:42:23,300
whatever the fuck the real number is.

689
00:42:23,510 --> 00:42:26,900
I bet it's about 10 I bet it's 10% of
people in this country on Adderall.

690
00:42:27,050 --> 00:42:31,430
If I had to guess, I bet it's around 30
million. I bet it's around there. Yeah,

691
00:42:31,580 --> 00:42:33,920
I'm not, yeah, I wouldn't be shocked.

692
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:37,130
I know a bunch of people that
are on it a bunch and you know,

693
00:42:37,131 --> 00:42:39,920
some people tell me they have to take
it. That's when my favorite one is.

694
00:42:39,921 --> 00:42:42,830
I have to take it. I won't tell you
what happens is you die, you disappear.

695
00:42:43,010 --> 00:42:46,400
What happens? You don't take it.
It's fucking speed, man. You know,

696
00:42:46,401 --> 00:42:49,460
like a lot of the people that take
it, they're not healthy otherwise.

697
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:51,800
Like they're not exercising,
they're not drinking a lot of water.

698
00:42:52,340 --> 00:42:55,700
They're not meditating, they're not
eating healthy foods. Like what do you,

699
00:42:55,730 --> 00:42:59,450
why do you need that? Like what happens
if you get rid of all that other stuff?

700
00:42:59,540 --> 00:43:03,560
Like cut out the shitty food, cut out
all the sugar, start drinking water,

701
00:43:03,561 --> 00:43:06,680
no booze. Let's get you
exercise in three times a week.

702
00:43:06,681 --> 00:43:08,710
Let me see if you really need
that. Adderall shit. Yeah.

703
00:43:08,900 --> 00:43:11,960
How many vitamins do you take? Do you
take vitamins? Do you eat healthy?

704
00:43:12,170 --> 00:43:14,300
Are you drinking fruit
juice and vegetable juice?

705
00:43:14,360 --> 00:43:17,480
Are you what kind of nutrients
you taking into your system, man?

706
00:43:17,481 --> 00:43:19,460
And you're wondering why you
don't have any fucking energy.

707
00:43:19,700 --> 00:43:22,760
So you're just pouring
jet fuel into your tank.

708
00:43:23,370 --> 00:43:26,750
Lighten the whole fucking thing on
fire. But, and the other hand is like,

709
00:43:26,751 --> 00:43:29,300
things get done when you take speed.

710
00:43:29,510 --> 00:43:32,630
You know what we were talking about
Hitler the other day that, um,

711
00:43:32,720 --> 00:43:35,920
why wouldn't she be, why wouldn't we
be, we were talking about who was,

712
00:43:35,960 --> 00:43:38,900
who were we talking about? Was it a
with Faheem? I don't remember. Um,

713
00:43:39,020 --> 00:43:41,690
but we were talking about how Hitler, um,

714
00:43:41,720 --> 00:43:46,160
w there was a time where Hitler had come
back from something and he was supposed

715
00:43:46,161 --> 00:43:48,500
to meet Mussolini and he was
like physically exhausted.

716
00:43:48,680 --> 00:43:53,330
So his doctor injected him
with a combination of steroids
and liquid cocaine and

717
00:43:53,360 --> 00:43:56,600
he just just fucking fill with energy.
He's like, give me another one.

718
00:43:56,810 --> 00:43:59,090
And the guy's like, no,
I can't give you another.

719
00:43:59,091 --> 00:44:00,680
It's like fucking give me another one.

720
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:04,340
And he gave him another one and then
he went to Mussolini and ranted at

721
00:44:04,341 --> 00:44:04,851
Mussolini.

722
00:44:04,851 --> 00:44:09,110
Just fucking talked at them for five
hours and Mussolini just never got a word

723
00:44:09,111 --> 00:44:12,830
in edgewise. And apparently mousseline
his plan was to talk to Hitler and go,

724
00:44:12,831 --> 00:44:14,630
Hey man, Italy wants to
get the fuck out of this.

725
00:44:14,631 --> 00:44:16,760
We're not really interested in
that. And he was like, what?

726
00:44:18,890 --> 00:44:21,920
Then just fucking going crazy for
five hours, sweating like a pig.

727
00:44:22,280 --> 00:44:25,580
Cause he was on fucking Coke,
he was on Coke and steroids.

728
00:44:25,820 --> 00:44:29,630
They just pumped him up with it. Maybe
it's best to stay away from some drugs.

729
00:44:29,660 --> 00:44:31,950
Yes. Okay. Yes. But

730
00:44:31,980 --> 00:44:32,750
I mean it's,

731
00:44:32,750 --> 00:44:37,750
it's amazing how much productivity
gets done because of caffeine.

732
00:44:38,070 --> 00:44:42,540
Right now. What is caffeine? Caffeine
is a very mild stimulant in terms of,

733
00:44:42,570 --> 00:44:44,820
you know, compared to Adderall
or things along those lines.

734
00:44:45,060 --> 00:44:47,340
But it is a fucking truck and it's a drug.

735
00:44:47,341 --> 00:44:51,060
There's a God damn drug store on
every corner. Everyone's buying it.

736
00:44:51,061 --> 00:44:55,580
It's in every gas station. Everyone's
fueling up. Y'all have few up caffeine.

737
00:44:55,581 --> 00:44:59,370
You know, I, I don't, I brought,
no, I drink decaffeinated coffee,

738
00:44:59,400 --> 00:45:03,360
which means I drink 5% of
what? Right. You know, I drink,

739
00:45:03,390 --> 00:45:07,080
I can drink eight cups of coffee and
it makes a, you just like the taste.

740
00:45:07,500 --> 00:45:10,830
I don't like the taste, but
I liked the social stuff.

741
00:45:10,950 --> 00:45:14,940
I like having a hot, bitter thing
in front of me. Let's just have tea.

742
00:45:15,090 --> 00:45:19,110
I have tea too. Yeah.
My eyeball. I nervously,

743
00:45:19,111 --> 00:45:23,610
I nervously drink. Yeah. But like,
you know, like some people smoke. Oh,

744
00:45:23,611 --> 00:45:26,220
I to sell sir. Like they have uh, uh,

745
00:45:26,250 --> 00:45:29,740
decaf coffee or decaf tea or something
like that. I like sells her too.

746
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:33,030
It makes me feel like I'm doing something
rather than drinking water. You know,

747
00:45:33,031 --> 00:45:35,760
like, I like sparkling water.
It's water with entertainment.

748
00:45:35,880 --> 00:45:37,830
I like sparkling water
with a little lime. Oh,

749
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:40,740
I've got a drink here and I
still drink. Or you know what,

750
00:45:40,890 --> 00:45:45,890
you take decaffeinated espresso and then
you pour a carbonated water on top of

751
00:45:46,171 --> 00:45:50,280
that and then you've got bitter bubbly.
You're drinking a potion, you want that.

752
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:51,233
You want a potion,

753
00:45:51,840 --> 00:45:55,800
a potion makes you feel like an adult
if they feel like it grow Koolaid.

754
00:45:55,830 --> 00:45:57,930
This is an adult boy.
Exactly. And when you're,

755
00:45:57,931 --> 00:46:00,210
when you're a non drinker of alcohol,

756
00:46:00,390 --> 00:46:04,290
you have to work very hard to look like
you're drinking like an adult. Yeah.

757
00:46:04,291 --> 00:46:07,710
So you've never fucked with alcohol at
all? No walls, no nothing. No nothing.

758
00:46:07,740 --> 00:46:11,250
I mean, try it. Okay. I know I'm
talking to somebody who pays attention.

759
00:46:11,580 --> 00:46:15,270
So you can say that there
is alcohol and vanilla,

760
00:46:15,660 --> 00:46:18,810
there's alcohol and things like
that. So you can't say none,

761
00:46:19,230 --> 00:46:22,170
but none that I ever acted.
I never, I never went to,

762
00:46:22,210 --> 00:46:27,090
I never went to a searched out. It feels
good, so I never even accidentally,

763
00:46:27,091 --> 00:46:30,620
no one ever even, you know, fuck with me
on that real well. That's good. That's,

764
00:46:30,700 --> 00:46:34,320
that's surprising. Yeah.
That is surprising. Given
the circles you travel in.

765
00:46:34,620 --> 00:46:37,080
I would imagine eventually someone
would be like, enough is enough.

766
00:46:37,081 --> 00:46:40,200
Get this guy fucked up. It's to be
funny. Yeah. This would be really funny.

767
00:46:40,320 --> 00:46:40,810
Yeah.

768
00:46:40,810 --> 00:46:44,220
It seems like someone would have that
would've fit in someone's sense of humor.

769
00:46:44,260 --> 00:46:48,310
Some great word knows. This may be the
day. No, I wouldn't do that. If you,

770
00:46:48,590 --> 00:46:52,760
if you really want to say the word, we'll
open up the box of doom. You box it.

771
00:46:53,100 --> 00:46:57,900
How often do you do a psych and drugs
drill? Yes, I can do not that often.

772
00:46:58,050 --> 00:47:00,210
A couple times a year I'll go get like,

773
00:47:00,540 --> 00:47:03,120
I mean we did mushrooms on a
podcast a couple months ago,

774
00:47:03,121 --> 00:47:06,510
but that was a small dose,
but a, the tank is my friend

775
00:47:09,290 --> 00:47:11,940
[inaudible] century two. I have one
right here. I have one your size.

776
00:47:12,790 --> 00:47:13,500
[inaudible].

777
00:47:13,500 --> 00:47:16,890
I went to one of these places where you
pay them X amount of money and you go,

778
00:47:16,891 --> 00:47:19,050
man, because my buddy Tim Jenison,

779
00:47:19,051 --> 00:47:21,630
we did a movie called Tim's Vermeer where
you painted a different mirror in his

780
00:47:21,631 --> 00:47:26,280
garage and uh, Tim was really into
that. I'll do anything Tim does. I just,

781
00:47:26,281 --> 00:47:30,070
I just loved him. And uh, so I
went and you know, whenever you pay

782
00:47:30,070 --> 00:47:34,210
a few bucks in you, you'd go in and
float in the tank. And I was so ready.

783
00:47:34,720 --> 00:47:37,570
I have S this happens so much in my life.

784
00:47:37,571 --> 00:47:39,970
I get so ready for a
major change in my life.

785
00:47:40,180 --> 00:47:43,450
The first time I wanted to become
a vegan, I went out with a friend.

786
00:47:43,451 --> 00:47:48,160
This was like in 1990 and there was a guy
who was making fun of brutally ripping

787
00:47:48,161 --> 00:47:52,330
them the fuck apart for a stupid
eating, you know. Then I said, listen,

788
00:47:52,870 --> 00:47:54,940
I want to go out with you to a restaurant,

789
00:47:55,240 --> 00:47:57,880
just eat vegetables and I'm
not going to interrupt you.

790
00:47:57,910 --> 00:47:59,160
I'm not going to make funny.

791
00:47:59,440 --> 00:48:03,910
You talk to me for three hours
about all your Peter singer's stuff,

792
00:48:03,940 --> 00:48:07,660
all your ethical vegetarian
stuff and you convert me,

793
00:48:07,690 --> 00:48:11,110
that's all I want you to do. Ah.
That was the reason I went out.

794
00:48:11,380 --> 00:48:14,860
That was the reason I went out with them
and I finished up the whole evening and

795
00:48:14,861 --> 00:48:18,460
I went, you know, I really respected
your point of view until I understood it.

796
00:48:20,080 --> 00:48:25,080
Then motherfucker talked me out of doing
what I wanted to do and so I got ready

797
00:48:26,531 --> 00:48:31,210
man with the, with, with the uh,
isolation tack. I said, this'll be good.

798
00:48:31,360 --> 00:48:35,110
He's told him about this. I'm just
going to go there. Sensory deprivation.

799
00:48:35,111 --> 00:48:38,500
I'll just let my mind wander. And I
went in there and it was just salting.

800
00:48:38,501 --> 00:48:39,820
I was bumping against walls.

801
00:48:40,510 --> 00:48:43,900
Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's, you need to get
used to it. It's like the meditation.

802
00:48:43,930 --> 00:48:45,160
Try meditating once you're like,

803
00:48:45,161 --> 00:48:49,840
I couldn't concentrate and meditate me
once is useless. Yes. Yeah. It's um,

804
00:48:50,380 --> 00:48:52,060
you often, you do the tech all the time.

805
00:48:52,180 --> 00:48:56,740
I used to have one of my handles
sitting now, no all times,

806
00:48:57,190 --> 00:48:59,100
but often I should say. Um,

807
00:48:59,230 --> 00:49:01,720
I used to have one in my house
and now I just have it here.

808
00:49:02,470 --> 00:49:07,120
But it's a very valuable tool.
And you meditate as well? Yeah,

809
00:49:07,150 --> 00:49:12,040
I meditate. I like to meditate for shows.
I've been doing a lot more lately. Um,

810
00:49:12,940 --> 00:49:17,170
uh, but the tank is a great place to
meditate as well because it's meditation

811
00:49:17,230 --> 00:49:18,063
squared.

812
00:49:18,100 --> 00:49:21,790
It's meditation without any external
stimulation so I can climb in there and

813
00:49:22,150 --> 00:49:22,300
[inaudible].

814
00:49:22,300 --> 00:49:23,133
And do you follow,

815
00:49:23,170 --> 00:49:26,140
do you follow breathing rules
and stuff you would do on normal?

816
00:49:26,230 --> 00:49:27,820
What kind of meditation do
you do when you meditate?

817
00:49:27,930 --> 00:49:29,250
I'll do what I've been doing.

818
00:49:29,251 --> 00:49:34,251
What I've been doing lately is all
I do is concentrate on my breath.

819
00:49:34,690 --> 00:49:39,510
Other things get in there, but I just
say, breathe in, breathe out, breathe in,

820
00:49:39,630 --> 00:49:43,710
breathe out, breathe in, breathe
out. And I just concentrate on long,

821
00:49:43,950 --> 00:49:48,630
slow, rhythmic breaths and I get
myself into this weird state.

822
00:49:48,930 --> 00:49:53,300
And you know, this'll come in. Ah,
you gotta fucking low front tire.

823
00:49:53,310 --> 00:49:56,610
You gotta you gotta get that
filled. Uh, this is, you need this,

824
00:49:56,611 --> 00:49:59,910
the your inspection sticker and
all and the bullshit comes in.

825
00:49:59,911 --> 00:50:02,580
But I just breathe in, breathe
out, force it out before,

826
00:50:02,730 --> 00:50:04,920
sit out and after five
or 10 minutes of this,

827
00:50:04,921 --> 00:50:08,280
I can get to a nice state where I can
just keep doing it, keep doing it.

828
00:50:08,580 --> 00:50:11,610
But in the tank, it's very
accentuated because in the tank,

829
00:50:11,790 --> 00:50:15,360
I don't have to think about my butt
in the seat, my hands on the table.

830
00:50:15,360 --> 00:50:17,820
I don't have to think about anything
else, just I'm just lying there.

831
00:50:17,880 --> 00:50:20,310
What you're experiencing when you're
talking about bumping into the walls,

832
00:50:20,640 --> 00:50:23,550
that's just a technique thing. When
you, when you lie in it, right?

833
00:50:23,580 --> 00:50:26,940
You get into the tank. First of all,
you need a big tank. You're a giant guy.

834
00:50:27,570 --> 00:50:29,350
Um, there's a lot of
those little pods, those,

835
00:50:29,450 --> 00:50:32,720
those are barely big enough from me.
You know, it's for a guy like you,

836
00:50:32,721 --> 00:50:36,470
you need a large one and you lie down on
the tank and then you put your hand on

837
00:50:36,471 --> 00:50:39,830
one wall and your hand on the other
wall and you let the water still,

838
00:50:39,950 --> 00:50:42,980
because it's going to be a lot of little
ripples when you're floating because

839
00:50:42,981 --> 00:50:43,671
you're so buoyant.

840
00:50:43,671 --> 00:50:47,030
There's a thousand pounds of Epsom salts
in there and you're floating and it's

841
00:50:47,031 --> 00:50:48,830
easy to just kind of
bounce back and forth.

842
00:50:49,160 --> 00:50:51,830
So you put your hands
there until they steady.

843
00:50:51,860 --> 00:50:56,330
And then once the ripples kind of stop,
then you slowly bring your hands down.

844
00:50:56,450 --> 00:50:58,190
And then when you slowly
bring your hands down,

845
00:50:58,191 --> 00:51:02,660
you do it really slow so you're not
making any ripples and then lay there.

846
00:51:02,690 --> 00:51:06,640
And then you could be in the exact
same position for hours. And that's,

847
00:51:06,670 --> 00:51:09,370
that's how it's a technique.
It's just you have to center you.

848
00:51:09,530 --> 00:51:10,363
So how long you do?

849
00:51:10,580 --> 00:51:15,320
Two hours is what I like to do and I'll
do an hour if I'm in a rush and I have,

850
00:51:15,640 --> 00:51:20,430
um, a, a work shape or throw it
is. Yeah. I mean, it's not a rush.

851
00:51:20,530 --> 00:51:24,620
It's just an hour. But if I can't
spend any more time than an hour,

852
00:51:24,621 --> 00:51:29,240
but I have a tape recorder that's voice
activated and it's Velcro and so I can

853
00:51:29,241 --> 00:51:33,290
stick it up inside the thing. So if
I have an idea, which I do sometimes,

854
00:51:33,410 --> 00:51:35,690
sometimes I have this temptation,
fuck, I gotta get outta here.

855
00:51:36,110 --> 00:51:38,900
I gotta write this down.
I can just say it and the,

856
00:51:38,901 --> 00:51:41,990
the tape recorder will pick it up and
there have been brilliant stuff you said

857
00:51:42,020 --> 00:51:44,450
no nothing and never
used it once it's there.

858
00:51:46,100 --> 00:51:48,620
You haven't gotten out of the
tech and had satisfaction? No,

859
00:51:48,680 --> 00:51:52,400
there's no that Keith Richards thing,
right that nobody went to sleep. Really.

860
00:51:52,490 --> 00:51:57,490
He had this sound activated recorder
that he got by the side of the bed and,

861
00:51:57,740 --> 00:52:00,590
and his guitar and he
went to sleep one night,

862
00:52:00,740 --> 00:52:04,160
woke up the next morning there
on the tape recorder. Oh,

863
00:52:04,640 --> 00:52:08,540
there was some voice activation in the
night. He played it. It was satisfaction.

864
00:52:08,780 --> 00:52:11,510
My friend. We haven't gotten that
yet. No, I haven't had that yet.

865
00:52:11,540 --> 00:52:14,900
My friend works at a school in
Connecticut where his kids go,

866
00:52:14,901 --> 00:52:19,901
or Keith Rich's kids go and Keith Richards
will ride on a bike to school with a

867
00:52:20,451 --> 00:52:24,920
fucking bandana on. And like my friends,
like, Holy shit, that's Keith Richards.

868
00:52:24,921 --> 00:52:28,240
Like he's just kinda hanging around
with normal people and he said,

869
00:52:28,241 --> 00:52:30,650
it freaks you out when you
see him. You're like, what?

870
00:52:30,770 --> 00:52:34,760
That's fucking Keith Richards. He
just hangs out. Just like, you know,

871
00:52:34,761 --> 00:52:36,260
he's a giant superstar,

872
00:52:36,261 --> 00:52:41,140
but he drifts into the real world and
it just freaks people out. Yeah, it's,

873
00:52:41,150 --> 00:52:43,340
it's, it's, it's, I mean,

874
00:52:43,341 --> 00:52:48,341
I only met Keith Richards in groups
of people that were what's really like

875
00:52:49,400 --> 00:52:53,660
bicycling into your yeah, but still
it's so, it's so amazing. Surreal,

876
00:52:53,720 --> 00:52:57,590
so surreal. Epic human. Yes.
The voice recorder thing is new.

877
00:52:57,650 --> 00:52:58,880
That's why I haven't had any new,

878
00:52:59,080 --> 00:53:01,400
it's a new idea that I have
because there's times that I did

879
00:53:02,960 --> 00:53:05,240
to this team thing and the, uh,

880
00:53:05,270 --> 00:53:08,720
and the separation of America
and getting more polarized.

881
00:53:08,930 --> 00:53:11,720
That's going to be solved by
Joe in the tank at some point.

882
00:53:12,050 --> 00:53:14,870
We can count on that. No, now
that you got the recorder,

883
00:53:14,990 --> 00:53:16,250
we're going to solve it ourselves.

884
00:53:16,280 --> 00:53:18,920
I think we're going to solve
it ourselves through just time.

885
00:53:18,980 --> 00:53:22,610
I think as we're getting back to Pinker
were talking about Pinker earlier that

886
00:53:22,611 --> 00:53:26,010
he gets so much shit for saying
that things are better than ever.

887
00:53:26,370 --> 00:53:29,910
It doesn't dismiss horrific acts.
It take place or terrible things.

888
00:53:29,911 --> 00:53:32,130
And it doesn't say that
the battle is over. No,

889
00:53:32,220 --> 00:53:37,220
I mean this is one of the things that
I would push in my little microcosm,

890
00:53:38,400 --> 00:53:41,320
push for so hard in Penn
and teller, you know, uh,

891
00:53:41,360 --> 00:53:45,750
tell her and I would have real
trouble just crossing a finish line.

892
00:53:46,170 --> 00:53:48,690
I would just say to him,
you know, tell her we, we,

893
00:53:48,900 --> 00:53:53,130
we've done five seasons of
bullshit and it went well,

894
00:53:53,310 --> 00:53:57,750
let's go out the two of us have coffee
and donuts and let's just say, wow,

895
00:53:57,780 --> 00:54:02,400
we did that and then push ahead for
the next thing. And I would just, uh,

896
00:54:02,640 --> 00:54:07,470
I just think that Pinker is like that
with me. Pinker's like saying, you know,

897
00:54:07,650 --> 00:54:10,980
human beings, we're doing
okay. We're doing okay,

898
00:54:11,130 --> 00:54:13,890
we'd done some really good things.
Now let's get back to work.

899
00:54:13,950 --> 00:54:16,140
We're most certainly doing
better than ever before.

900
00:54:16,141 --> 00:54:19,230
And I think that's an accumulative
thing. It's like it's time.

901
00:54:19,280 --> 00:54:21,270
Don't blow everything that pink came come,

902
00:54:21,450 --> 00:54:24,840
which if we don't destroy the
environment, if those two things,

903
00:54:24,841 --> 00:54:28,530
the two enormous ifs, we're
in very good shape. They are.

904
00:54:28,590 --> 00:54:31,170
The thing that blew my
mind about Pinker in that,

905
00:54:31,171 --> 00:54:35,370
in that book better
angels blew my mind is,

906
00:54:36,510 --> 00:54:40,380
uh, there's this line that's that,
that, that has been obsessing me, uh,

907
00:54:40,620 --> 00:54:45,150
with a Cracker in teenage angst. I
don't know what the world may need,

908
00:54:45,180 --> 00:54:48,360
but I sure as hell know it starts
with me. And that's a wisdom.

909
00:54:48,630 --> 00:54:53,630
I've laughed at all this shit that I've
laughed at that turns out to be true for

910
00:54:54,031 --> 00:54:58,800
me now. It just makes me smile
and fills me with joy. You know,

911
00:54:59,490 --> 00:55:01,230
uh, early part of the 20th century,

912
00:55:01,290 --> 00:55:06,090
all these authors and artists and all
these guys were saying Hemingway's step,

913
00:55:06,420 --> 00:55:11,420
we're gonna stop war by writing about
war and writing about how bad it was.

914
00:55:12,630 --> 00:55:16,620
And we're going to give empathy for other
people and we'll understand this and

915
00:55:16,621 --> 00:55:21,510
we're going to really, with our art,
make an effort to make humanity better.

916
00:55:21,900 --> 00:55:25,880
What I Jack off bullshit
thing to do. I think there's,

917
00:55:26,580 --> 00:55:31,260
could you imagine something more that's
just twiddling your Dick than say a

918
00:55:31,560 --> 00:55:32,790
neck. Oh, I'm going to do art.

919
00:55:32,820 --> 00:55:35,460
I'm going to write and it's
going to change the wine poetry.

920
00:55:35,880 --> 00:55:40,020
And then Pinker's book says, why is
all this stuff get better so fast?

921
00:55:40,440 --> 00:55:45,180
We think it may be art had a baby empathy.

922
00:55:45,510 --> 00:55:49,620
And it turns out that, uh, all this
stuff people were saying about, you know,

923
00:55:49,800 --> 00:55:50,910
we can change,

924
00:55:50,940 --> 00:55:55,940
we can change how people see warfare
and how people see one another.

925
00:55:56,790 --> 00:56:00,210
And that's what scares
me so much about, um,

926
00:56:00,540 --> 00:56:04,560
how some people speak of. And I think
it's because I don't understand it.

927
00:56:05,130 --> 00:56:07,860
Usually when I'm against something,
it means I don't understand it.

928
00:56:08,310 --> 00:56:10,620
But when they talk about
cultural appropriation,

929
00:56:11,160 --> 00:56:15,360
cultural appropriation seems to me to be
the greatest thing you can possibly do

930
00:56:15,750 --> 00:56:20,240
to see the world through the eyes of
someone who grew up differently than you.

931
00:56:20,460 --> 00:56:22,950
To even try to do that for. Even for,

932
00:56:23,110 --> 00:56:27,610
to pretend right now to be a a, you know,

933
00:56:27,690 --> 00:56:29,050
white nationalist

934
00:56:29,360 --> 00:56:34,360
even trying to do that seems like it's a
really good thing for us trying 10 just

935
00:56:34,551 --> 00:56:38,840
to get into their head just to try
to fantasize what it's like to be,

936
00:56:39,100 --> 00:56:41,640
for instance, a uh, uh,

937
00:56:41,650 --> 00:56:46,630
African American transgender
man. If we try to do that,

938
00:56:46,631 --> 00:56:50,080
we're writing a piece of art and we
try to see ourselves from that point of

939
00:56:50,081 --> 00:56:53,560
view. I'm not, not that I'm not herself
see the world from that point of view.

940
00:56:53,830 --> 00:56:55,690
That seems like nothing but healthy.

941
00:56:56,320 --> 00:56:59,590
It seems like that takes you
out of your identification.

942
00:56:59,870 --> 00:57:04,730
Well, I think there's a lot of what we're
calling cultural appropriation that is

943
00:57:04,731 --> 00:57:07,460
really people trying to tell
other people what to do.

944
00:57:08,030 --> 00:57:11,900
Cause people enjoy telling people they
can't do that anymore and getting angry

945
00:57:11,901 --> 00:57:15,110
at those people. They enjoy it.
They enjoy pushing buttons. People,

946
00:57:15,111 --> 00:57:16,580
you give them a rock and a window,

947
00:57:16,581 --> 00:57:17,990
they want to throw that
rock through the window.

948
00:57:18,680 --> 00:57:21,860
It's a natural part of being a person.
And if you see a girl with hoop earrings,

949
00:57:21,861 --> 00:57:23,330
like bitch, take those earrings off.

950
00:57:23,331 --> 00:57:26,590
Those are for Latino's or there's a for
this. So those are for that. I mean,

951
00:57:26,630 --> 00:57:30,410
and the argument is so often
not even based historically,

952
00:57:30,411 --> 00:57:32,540
like the earring thing. Like fuck Ben,

953
00:57:32,541 --> 00:57:36,360
what are you from Sumir like that's the
oldest known hoop earrings like you,

954
00:57:36,710 --> 00:57:37,760
that's all you're from Babylon.

955
00:57:37,840 --> 00:57:42,460
It's also what a, I don't know if this
is, this is not Pinker, this is Noah. Um,

956
00:57:43,330 --> 00:57:47,830
Rari um, who uh, who talks about when
you're talking about cultural stuff,

957
00:57:47,890 --> 00:57:51,250
how far back you going? Right? I
mean, there are no tomatoes in Italy,

958
00:57:51,750 --> 00:57:54,280
but you know, sure. Yeah.
Tomatoes are not indigenous.

959
00:57:54,281 --> 00:57:58,550
Italy pasta came from China and
potatoes aren't from Ireland. They,

960
00:57:58,551 --> 00:58:01,210
they don't start there. You know,
so you have to keep going back.

961
00:58:01,330 --> 00:58:05,560
There was a great, you know, uh, Paul
Simon got so much shit for Graceland,

962
00:58:06,570 --> 00:58:08,410
uh, you know, and uh, and,

963
00:58:08,411 --> 00:58:13,220
and David Byrne get so much shit for
stuff and there's this wonderful thing and

964
00:58:13,240 --> 00:58:17,590
David Burns, uh, book how music
works, which is a fabulous book,

965
00:58:17,860 --> 00:58:22,780
but he doesn't ever address this
picking things from other cultures ever.

966
00:58:23,110 --> 00:58:28,110
But he talks very strongly about the
African kinds of music and the influences

967
00:58:29,861 --> 00:58:33,430
they have from other places.
You know, cause there is not,

968
00:58:33,850 --> 00:58:37,480
there is not a culture
other than the whole world,

969
00:58:37,570 --> 00:58:42,490
especially not now. You might be able
to have made the argument 200 years ago.

970
00:58:42,970 --> 00:58:43,320
There were

971
00:58:43,320 --> 00:58:46,530
Pat, the thing is though,
that people enjoy cultures.

972
00:58:46,560 --> 00:58:50,460
So if that is the case and everything
does assimilate and becomes one big gray

973
00:58:50,461 --> 00:58:53,430
mass, we're worried that we're
gonna lose Indian food. Right.

974
00:58:53,670 --> 00:58:57,720
We're worried that we're going to lose.
I have no worry of that at all. No,

975
00:58:57,780 --> 00:59:00,360
I have no worry because I think that me

976
00:59:00,460 --> 00:59:01,810
loving sun RA,

977
00:59:02,290 --> 00:59:06,760
even though I'm not African
American and me loving Lenny Bruce,

978
00:59:06,790 --> 00:59:10,330
even though I'm not urban
and identify as Jewish,

979
00:59:10,600 --> 00:59:15,600
I think that loving these
kinds of cultures should
not be based on an accident

980
00:59:16,031 --> 00:59:16,940
of birth. The

981
00:59:16,940 --> 00:59:18,500
loving thing is one thing though.

982
00:59:18,590 --> 00:59:22,220
I think the real fear of cultural
appropriations is that will take on those

983
00:59:22,221 --> 00:59:25,820
things as their own. Like
there's a gentleman, I'm
trying to remember his name.

984
00:59:26,370 --> 00:59:30,200
Uh, he is a famous Mexican
chef, but he's not Mexican,

985
00:59:30,201 --> 00:59:33,770
but he cooks Mexican food. He
cooks it in Chicago. Walt Bayless,

986
00:59:33,800 --> 00:59:37,820
is that his name? Um, something.
Bayliss. Rick Bayless. Rick Bayless. He,

987
00:59:37,821 --> 00:59:42,740
this guy has an undeniable
passion for Mexican cuisine.

988
00:59:42,770 --> 00:59:44,360
I mean, he fucking loves it.

989
00:59:44,660 --> 00:59:48,950
He has a couple different restaurants
where he cooks Mexican food and he was

990
00:59:48,951 --> 00:59:52,490
getting protested and people
were furious at him. Um,

991
00:59:52,520 --> 00:59:55,670
because they had just decided at one
point if this guys had like, you know,

992
00:59:55,671 --> 01:00:00,170
a 30 fucking year career of being in love
with Mexican cuisine and being like a

993
01:00:00,171 --> 01:00:04,640
real historian of Mexican cuisine
work where it comes from. The regions,

994
01:00:04,760 --> 01:00:07,190
the ingredients, like
where's the best ingredients,

995
01:00:07,400 --> 01:00:09,950
where's the best places to cook
these things, how they do it,

996
01:00:09,951 --> 01:00:14,150
why they did it this way and I mean
speaks with incredible passion about this.

997
01:00:14,810 --> 01:00:17,030
They were deciding that he's
a white guy and he shouldn't,

998
01:00:17,100 --> 01:00:18,740
shouldn't be able to do this,
shouldn't be able to sell. This,

999
01:00:18,741 --> 01:00:20,900
shouldn't be able to like
do you fucking assholes?

1000
01:00:20,901 --> 01:00:25,901
Like this is the guy he's helping
everyone recognize the beauty of this much

1001
01:00:26,871 --> 01:00:30,110
maligned food. When you, when
people think about Mexican cuisine,

1002
01:00:30,320 --> 01:00:35,270
he is one of the rare people in Western
culture that talks about it like it's

1003
01:00:35,271 --> 01:00:37,370
five-star cuisine. So
many people talk about,

1004
01:00:37,371 --> 01:00:41,270
Oh I love street tacos and fucking I'm
going to be a big fan of case a D no,

1005
01:00:41,271 --> 01:00:45,950
this guy is talking about the very best
Mexican cuisine in the world and trying

1006
01:00:45,951 --> 01:00:50,240
to interpret that and sell it to people
and trying to turn people on to how good

1007
01:00:50,241 --> 01:00:51,074
this food is.

1008
01:00:51,110 --> 01:00:56,110
And yet he was taking so much shit when
a person that wasn't born in that act,

1009
01:00:56,830 --> 01:01:01,720
the accident of birth to be in there
falls in love with another culture.

1010
01:01:01,720 --> 01:01:06,400
I don't see why that isn't more beautiful.
Yes. Yeah. That's, that's, that's,

1011
01:01:06,430 --> 01:01:09,670
that's what I'm looking for. That
Steven Seagal. Yeah. He moved to Japan,

1012
01:01:09,980 --> 01:01:13,240
became a master before
he became kind of silly.

1013
01:01:13,510 --> 01:01:18,220
He was one of the very first guys to
ever teach a kiddo in a dojo in Japan.

1014
01:01:18,221 --> 01:01:21,190
That wasn't Japanese. I think
he actually was the first,

1015
01:01:21,460 --> 01:01:25,570
I think it was the first American
to ever run a dojo in Japan. So no.

1016
01:01:26,110 --> 01:01:26,620
Okay.

1017
01:01:26,620 --> 01:01:30,730
Giving me on psychedelics is very easy
compared to getting me to really dig

1018
01:01:31,180 --> 01:01:34,150
Stevenson guy. I mean, I'm not sure I do,

1019
01:01:34,151 --> 01:01:36,700
although I do appreciate his
first movie above the law.

1020
01:01:36,940 --> 01:01:40,930
I appreciate what he look.
He likes his prepositions.

1021
01:01:40,960 --> 01:01:45,370
He's a silly fail silly fella
for sure. Many of us are. Sure.

1022
01:01:45,371 --> 01:01:50,110
But what he, he did do is
he learned I KIDO at a very,

1023
01:01:50,111 --> 01:01:52,150
very high level, like undeniably.

1024
01:01:52,510 --> 01:01:55,690
And he was teaching and in
Japan he spoke perfect Japanese.

1025
01:01:55,691 --> 01:01:59,380
And it was a very rare guy,
you know, and now, you know,

1026
01:01:59,400 --> 01:02:02,740
became a Hollywood guy in movies
and who knows what the fuck else.

1027
01:02:02,741 --> 01:02:06,640
And it became an enormous, you know,
physically you got fat and you know,

1028
01:02:06,641 --> 01:02:07,690
he's kind of silly now,

1029
01:02:08,050 --> 01:02:11,140
but at one point in time that
guy was as legit as it gets.

1030
01:02:11,170 --> 01:02:14,940
Isn't that always true? It's
always starts. You don't want it.

1031
01:02:15,100 --> 01:02:18,610
I'm going to completely change the
subject is like if I met, you know,

1032
01:02:18,880 --> 01:02:20,190
I to talk about

1033
01:02:20,190 --> 01:02:23,760
when you came on my radio show with Phil
plait about the talking about the moon

1034
01:02:23,761 --> 01:02:27,540
landing. Yeah. But what I, what I
think is fascinating about this,

1035
01:02:27,630 --> 01:02:32,300
about clubs and stuff, you know,
is, uh, I, uh, you know, and I,

1036
01:02:32,310 --> 01:02:35,630
I know I've, I've read here
and there that you, you've, uh,

1037
01:02:35,770 --> 01:02:39,360
you've gone back on a lot of that and
your conspiracy stuff. And so, yeah,

1038
01:02:39,450 --> 01:02:41,790
but that, that's not what
I can explain that to.

1039
01:02:42,420 --> 01:02:45,210
I don't know what I'm talking about.
You know, this, this is the thing,

1040
01:02:45,211 --> 01:02:49,380
I have zero astrophysics education. Zero.

1041
01:02:49,620 --> 01:02:54,120
I don't know anything about whether or
not it's possible to put people on the

1042
01:02:54,120 --> 01:02:58,240
moon. I do know fuckery and
I, I do know teams and I do,

1043
01:02:58,330 --> 01:03:00,420
I do understand when people
are bullshitting people.

1044
01:03:00,421 --> 01:03:03,960
And I think there's a lot of that
with, with a lot of the NASA stuff,

1045
01:03:03,990 --> 01:03:04,920
a lot of the older stuff,

1046
01:03:05,040 --> 01:03:09,720
and particularly there was a lot of
manipulation of images and putting things

1047
01:03:09,721 --> 01:03:14,070
online that may not have actually really
happened because it was press releases

1048
01:03:14,071 --> 01:03:18,270
and there's an image of Michael Collins
from like a Gemini 15, that's a, a,

1049
01:03:18,280 --> 01:03:21,390
a very clear, um, image of him, uh,

1050
01:03:21,420 --> 01:03:25,080
doing a simulation like in a
studio with straps and harnesses.

1051
01:03:25,320 --> 01:03:30,320
And then someone from NASA or
someone put that exact same image,

1052
01:03:31,020 --> 01:03:35,160
blacked out the background and used
it as a photo of, um, of a space.

1053
01:03:35,560 --> 01:03:38,760
Meaning it's not real, you
know, but they sold it as real.

1054
01:03:38,970 --> 01:03:41,580
There was some overzealous
shirt like that,

1055
01:03:41,760 --> 01:03:46,230
that if you're conspiratorially
minded, you might say, ah, once,

1056
01:03:46,260 --> 01:03:48,570
once you start lying. Yes.

1057
01:03:50,110 --> 01:03:54,230
[inaudible] you're 51 and stuff. We
know they lied like motherfuckers. Yeah.

1058
01:03:54,270 --> 01:03:55,380
And that's the problem.

1059
01:03:55,620 --> 01:03:59,190
But what I just want to compliment you
and I just also think this is really

1060
01:03:59,191 --> 01:04:02,760
interesting, you know, so Joe
Rogan believes this crazy shit.

1061
01:04:02,761 --> 01:04:05,210
We didn't go to the bone. I
know Joe Rogan, we're on it.

1062
01:04:05,340 --> 01:04:08,160
We're on a radio show together,
but dah, dah, dah. He's a good guy.

1063
01:04:08,280 --> 01:04:11,040
But that fear factor, but, and
he believes this shit. Let's,

1064
01:04:11,070 --> 01:04:13,860
let's have him talk to someone
who's real. So I call Phil play do.

1065
01:04:13,860 --> 01:04:15,090
I don't know that well, right?

1066
01:04:15,450 --> 01:04:18,730
But he's the bad astronomer and
he knows this shit. And I say,

1067
01:04:19,140 --> 01:04:23,970
I really want you to come on my radio
show and just talk to Joe Rogan about, uh,

1068
01:04:24,270 --> 01:04:28,800
about, um, the moon landing landing.
And uh, Phil says, OK, no problem.

1069
01:04:28,880 --> 01:04:30,600
We'll just go on there. We'll,
we'll set them straight. And I go,

1070
01:04:30,670 --> 01:04:35,580
I just want to warn you, uh, have your
ducks in a row. Cause Joe's really good.

1071
01:04:36,030 --> 01:04:39,330
And he goes, well, Joe's Joe's
a comic, right? I go, yeah,

1072
01:04:39,720 --> 01:04:43,620
and that's your problem because
Joe's better at talking than you.

1073
01:04:43,890 --> 01:04:45,840
Joe knows when the commercials are coming.

1074
01:04:46,650 --> 01:04:50,970
Joe knows how to make a joke and Joe
knows also how to set you up and take you

1075
01:04:50,971 --> 01:04:53,700
down here. Oh no, no, no.
It'll be no problem. I said,

1076
01:04:54,870 --> 01:04:57,930
you understand that he's smart.
He's a comic, right? Yeah.

1077
01:04:58,470 --> 01:05:02,070
Not an Astro physicist, but you
understand that he's smart and he's also,

1078
01:05:02,760 --> 01:05:06,780
you are going into his form.
We're going to be on radio.

1079
01:05:06,930 --> 01:05:09,810
This guy has done a lot of radio.

1080
01:05:09,930 --> 01:05:12,120
This guy's talked to a lot of people,

1081
01:05:12,210 --> 01:05:15,810
so just have all your facts in
line and then we're sitting there,

1082
01:05:16,080 --> 01:05:18,280
cause you know, you were,
you were on the phone and

1083
01:05:18,510 --> 01:05:21,880
uh, Gudo it was on my podcast with me too,

1084
01:05:22,120 --> 01:05:26,350
sitting across from me and we're
listening and you come in and you come in

1085
01:05:26,590 --> 01:05:31,590
humble and charming and sexy and
with perfect timing on everything.

1086
01:05:34,060 --> 01:05:38,140
And Phil placed as well.
I'm like, go, Oh man,

1087
01:05:38,410 --> 01:05:41,590
Joe is wrong and Joe is
going to fucking win.

1088
01:05:43,600 --> 01:05:47,170
And I said, how you set
this up so that, um,

1089
01:05:47,440 --> 01:05:50,800
so that uh, it will be
a fee. It'd be fair.

1090
01:05:51,010 --> 01:05:52,880
My whole thing of doing this,

1091
01:05:52,920 --> 01:05:56,560
the way I bill boarded it was I'm just
going to have two guys talk from two

1092
01:05:56,561 --> 01:05:59,620
points of view. I'm not supposed to
commit it. I don't know if you remember,

1093
01:05:59,800 --> 01:06:04,210
but the whole show EDS and I go, Oh,
by the way, we did lay it on the moon.

1094
01:06:06,020 --> 01:06:09,970
They just tried to do this final authority
thing and Phil us afterwards. Well,

1095
01:06:09,971 --> 01:06:12,040
he, he had, I said, yes. Yeah.

1096
01:06:12,220 --> 01:06:15,820
And it's just that idea
that you can't, you know,

1097
01:06:15,821 --> 01:06:18,850
his idea was there's the
science team. That's right.

1098
01:06:18,970 --> 01:06:23,970
And then there's just goofy comic and
trying to get Phil plait understand that a

1099
01:06:24,401 --> 01:06:26,950
goofy comic was not a goofy comic.

1100
01:06:27,100 --> 01:06:32,100
And I believe that the only thing that
the SATs truly test is how good you will

1101
01:06:32,951 --> 01:06:36,640
be. That can be as a
comedian, that kind of verbal,

1102
01:06:36,820 --> 01:06:38,320
it was a wonderful thing to listen to.

1103
01:06:38,321 --> 01:06:43,321
It was wonderful to listen to someone
who I believe absolutely was 100% wrong

1104
01:06:44,140 --> 01:06:49,140
who was just so skilled and so moral
and so thoughtful and so humble.

1105
01:06:50,020 --> 01:06:53,440
You had everything going
for you that I respect,

1106
01:06:53,620 --> 01:06:55,540
except it didn't happen to be right.

1107
01:06:56,100 --> 01:06:58,860
Well, we don't know what happened.

1108
01:06:59,100 --> 01:07:02,160
We assume that what we
see is what happened.

1109
01:07:02,161 --> 01:07:04,800
We assume that what the scientist
tell us was hat was what happened.

1110
01:07:04,801 --> 01:07:08,820
We assumed that what NASA told us
was what happened. When you say,

1111
01:07:09,120 --> 01:07:13,620
I know this happened. Right.
You are not always correct.

1112
01:07:13,650 --> 01:07:17,760
Exactly. Oftentimes. Correct. I know
Kennedy got assassinated in Dallas.

1113
01:07:17,970 --> 01:07:20,700
I've seen the video. I know
he got assassinated. Dallas.

1114
01:07:20,940 --> 01:07:23,820
I don't know of Lee Harvey
Oswald did it? I don't know.

1115
01:07:24,150 --> 01:07:26,950
I assume he was involved.
It seems like he was. Yeah.

1116
01:07:27,180 --> 01:07:29,850
Was there other people involved
to, I assume there were,

1117
01:07:30,210 --> 01:07:33,780
and one of the reasons why I assumed
there were the magic bullet. The fucking,

1118
01:07:33,781 --> 01:07:37,860
the guy who got hit with the ricochet
under the overpass know that I made the

1119
01:07:37,861 --> 01:07:41,190
shot with Amandla Huracan. Oh yeah. It
can be made. Yeah. Oh, that's horse shit.

1120
01:07:41,220 --> 01:07:45,750
Listen, I've talked about that
in, in length towards that.

1121
01:07:46,300 --> 01:07:50,400
Yeah. Well, there's a lot of things
is a lot of things. Um, there's,

1122
01:07:50,430 --> 01:07:53,610
there's a lot of things we could
go over the Kennedy assassination.

1123
01:07:53,611 --> 01:07:55,920
There's a lot of things.
I'm not [inaudible]

1124
01:07:56,260 --> 01:07:57,093
are we good?

1125
01:07:57,370 --> 01:08:01,420
Are we going to solve the polarization
in America or are we gonna sell them the

1126
01:08:01,421 --> 01:08:03,520
Kennedy assassination? Or are
we going to solve the bullying?

1127
01:08:03,880 --> 01:08:06,490
Or you would do all of them. Okay. I
just want to know what our goals were.

1128
01:08:06,670 --> 01:08:07,490
The Moonlight branding

1129
01:08:07,490 --> 01:08:12,490
is a conspiracy theories
dream of conspiracy theorists
dream because it's got

1130
01:08:13,460 --> 01:08:17,990
everything in place. It's got this
incredible technological achievement.

1131
01:08:18,230 --> 01:08:22,580
It's got these three guys
that look incredibly nervous
at the post landing press

1132
01:08:22,581 --> 01:08:24,920
conference and they'll
look all sketched out.

1133
01:08:25,100 --> 01:08:27,740
It's got these guys that don't
do interviews afterwards.

1134
01:08:27,741 --> 01:08:32,300
It's got no one ever lands on the moon
again after 1973 or whatever it was.

1135
01:08:32,690 --> 01:08:35,720
It's got all these
technological achievements,

1136
01:08:35,721 --> 01:08:38,390
but we never get outside of
Earth's atmosphere again.

1137
01:08:38,570 --> 01:08:40,160
We're always inside of Earth's orbit.

1138
01:08:40,340 --> 01:08:44,870
There's so many beautiful things that
conspiracy theories can grasp a hold of

1139
01:08:44,871 --> 01:08:47,420
them. Go see it's bullshit.
But it doesn't mean it,

1140
01:08:47,480 --> 01:08:51,170
but it doesn't mean it didn't happen.
There's the van Allen radiation belts.

1141
01:08:51,171 --> 01:08:51,831
There's that.

1142
01:08:51,831 --> 01:08:54,830
We never even send a chicken in deep
space and had to come back alive.

1143
01:08:55,040 --> 01:08:58,130
There's all these things, but it
doesn't mean it didn't have. Right.

1144
01:08:58,280 --> 01:09:02,210
And my problem was, and this is, you
know, when people said, Oh, you know,

1145
01:09:02,211 --> 01:09:04,790
you've sold out. You're a shill
now. And like, no, no, no.

1146
01:09:05,030 --> 01:09:06,410
I'm just being honest now.

1147
01:09:06,530 --> 01:09:10,340
Whereas before I wasn't being honest with
myself and I wasn't being honest about

1148
01:09:10,341 --> 01:09:14,270
the subject. I do not know whether
or not people went to the moon.

1149
01:09:14,300 --> 01:09:15,740
I was pretending that.

1150
01:09:15,741 --> 01:09:19,640
I knew that people didn't go to the
moon and I was arguing it that way.

1151
01:09:19,910 --> 01:09:23,510
I was on a team, I was
on team. It's bullshit.

1152
01:09:23,540 --> 01:09:26,930
We didn't go to the moon and you,

1153
01:09:27,020 --> 01:09:30,980
you really can't do that
accurately. It can't be done.

1154
01:09:31,260 --> 01:09:35,540
You can say, this is what's interesting.
This is what I find curious.

1155
01:09:35,780 --> 01:09:37,880
This is what's weird. In fact,

1156
01:09:37,881 --> 01:09:41,270
there's not a single technological
achievement from 1969 that's not cheaper,

1157
01:09:41,271 --> 01:09:45,590
easier and faster to reproduce today
except going to the moon like he's one of

1158
01:09:45,591 --> 01:09:48,890
the rare things in life that still
doesn't mean it didn't happen. Right?

1159
01:09:48,950 --> 01:09:49,783
Like outcomes.

1160
01:09:50,240 --> 01:09:53,730
Razor's a slippery thing because there's
weird shit that happens and you gotta

1161
01:09:53,760 --> 01:09:55,970
take that into account.
Like there's no absolutes.

1162
01:09:55,971 --> 01:09:57,620
There's not one thing that you can say,

1163
01:09:57,621 --> 01:10:00,410
well there is a rule and this rule
must be followed. And here's that rule.

1164
01:10:00,950 --> 01:10:03,530
It doesn't work that way.
The world is made of weird.

1165
01:10:03,870 --> 01:10:07,740
And I'm also the, the, the idea, there's,

1166
01:10:07,770 --> 01:10:09,270
there's a thing that's changed.

1167
01:10:09,271 --> 01:10:12,210
There was an article in the times
about this and you might've even been

1168
01:10:12,211 --> 01:10:16,110
mentioned in it. Um, there's a, uh,

1169
01:10:16,560 --> 01:10:21,560
a playful space of conspiracy theories
that it's taken me a long time to

1170
01:10:23,791 --> 01:10:24,540
understand.

1171
01:10:24,540 --> 01:10:29,540
My daughter is 14 and she talks about,

1172
01:10:29,610 --> 01:10:30,060
you know, her,

1173
01:10:30,060 --> 01:10:34,110
her father did a show called bullshit
and she talks about how she loves

1174
01:10:34,111 --> 01:10:38,670
conspiracy theories and this is from
Paul McCartney's dead till we didn't land

1175
01:10:38,671 --> 01:10:41,880
on the moon, all those
things. But she sees it,

1176
01:10:42,240 --> 01:10:45,000
which I so hard for me to understand.

1177
01:10:45,240 --> 01:10:48,210
She sees it as not impacting reality,

1178
01:10:48,780 --> 01:10:52,950
but as a playful inter
intellectual exercise.

1179
01:10:53,370 --> 01:10:54,870
I don't know what's going on.

1180
01:10:55,110 --> 01:10:57,990
But there was this wonderful article in
the times and you were mentioned there

1181
01:10:57,991 --> 01:11:02,820
too, but there's also another
guy who does it who will do this.

1182
01:11:03,640 --> 01:11:05,840
Uh, to use a cliche, I can't
think of a better one going,

1183
01:11:05,880 --> 01:11:09,330
going down the rabbit
hole of conspiracy stuff,

1184
01:11:09,360 --> 01:11:14,360
playing around with the logic that feels
like a mathematical thing or a pure

1185
01:11:16,591 --> 01:11:21,591
philosophical thing or a or a angels
dancing on the head of a pin thing and a,

1186
01:11:22,771 --> 01:11:26,640
there's a quality that you have learned,

1187
01:11:27,780 --> 01:11:28,110
um,

1188
01:11:28,110 --> 01:11:33,110
that my daughter has learned
indirectly I think from you,

1189
01:11:34,320 --> 01:11:34,470
um,

1190
01:11:34,470 --> 01:11:39,470
through other people doing this of there
is a playful space or rediscuss how we,

1191
01:11:43,020 --> 01:11:43,080
uh,

1192
01:11:43,080 --> 01:11:48,080
how we share our reality that is happening
in the conspiracy theory art form and

1193
01:11:51,301 --> 01:11:56,301
the conspiracy theory art form is now
seeming to me to be more like rap or rock

1194
01:11:59,491 --> 01:12:04,491
and roll or it's just a form of thing
where you play around with this kind of

1195
01:12:05,191 --> 01:12:09,300
thing. And I am so I'm literal minded.

1196
01:12:09,520 --> 01:12:13,890
So verbal minded, you know, Bob Dylan's
easy for me. The stones are hard,

1197
01:12:14,490 --> 01:12:17,310
you know, Zappa's easy, 20th
century classical's easy,

1198
01:12:17,520 --> 01:12:21,690
but just funk is hard for me and
it's the same kind of thing here.

1199
01:12:21,691 --> 01:12:26,580
It's really easy for me to
say we are doing, um, uh,

1200
01:12:27,720 --> 01:12:32,340
the old fashioned scientific inquiry
and this is the way falsifiable,

1201
01:12:32,520 --> 01:12:37,380
but there is something happening in
our thinking that's really interesting.

1202
01:12:37,410 --> 01:12:41,820
Then I had to have my daughter explained
to me and the New York times after I

1203
01:12:41,821 --> 01:12:42,230
already [inaudible]

1204
01:12:42,230 --> 01:12:44,240
I knew you and watched
you do it. Well, you've,

1205
01:12:44,570 --> 01:12:47,150
you've always been a champion
of science and reason, right?

1206
01:12:47,151 --> 01:12:48,740
And conspiracy theories for the most part,

1207
01:12:48,741 --> 01:12:52,460
flying the face of science and reason.
And if you don't want to be a buffoon,

1208
01:12:52,580 --> 01:12:57,400
nobody wants hopeful poetic theory
happening. But it's tricky and you don't,

1209
01:12:57,410 --> 01:12:59,960
people don't want to be a fool.
Well, I'm a professional fool.

1210
01:13:00,230 --> 01:13:02,090
I don't mind being a fool and you know,

1211
01:13:02,091 --> 01:13:05,600
being self-deprecating and being a moron
as part of being a comic, it's fun.

1212
01:13:06,380 --> 01:13:07,100
The,

1213
01:13:07,100 --> 01:13:12,100
the conspiracy theory world went South
for me when I did a television show.

1214
01:13:13,070 --> 01:13:16,010
I did that. Joe Rogan questions.
Everything shown. I spent six,

1215
01:13:16,011 --> 01:13:19,490
seven months doing this show and at the
end of it I was like, okay, I get it.

1216
01:13:19,610 --> 01:13:23,690
This is a bunch of unfuckable white
guys. That's what it really is.

1217
01:13:23,840 --> 01:13:26,400
That's what I decided. I said, you
know, I had a bit about it. I said,

1218
01:13:26,450 --> 01:13:26,840
do you want him?

1219
01:13:26,840 --> 01:13:30,380
The one thing you don't find when you're
looking for big foot black people,

1220
01:13:31,340 --> 01:13:34,870
you're more likely to find Bigfoot than
you want black guys looking for big foot

1221
01:13:35,220 --> 01:13:37,960
is a bunch of unfuckable white
dudes out camping and listening to,

1222
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:41,150
what did you hear that? What is that?
You know? It's like it's nonsense.

1223
01:13:41,151 --> 01:13:41,651
Like you're,

1224
01:13:41,651 --> 01:13:44,780
you're wrapped up in this idea that
there's a mystery and there's a something.

1225
01:13:45,140 --> 01:13:48,920
There's a thing, a quality, but human
beings where we want to uncover secrets,

1226
01:13:48,921 --> 01:13:53,330
we want to be the person that finds out
the truth because then you're miserable.

1227
01:13:53,600 --> 01:13:56,630
So shitty fucking life now doesn't matter.

1228
01:13:56,660 --> 01:14:00,770
The fucking aliens are real
man. They're here and aha.

1229
01:14:01,010 --> 01:14:03,550
Aha. One of the best

1230
01:14:03,960 --> 01:14:08,710
things we can get probably better
than coming, is that feeling of, aha,

1231
01:14:08,800 --> 01:14:10,840
I understand. I've gotten a,

1232
01:14:11,920 --> 01:14:16,900
and we see this all the time, detective
shows, you know, Sherlock Holmes,

1233
01:14:16,990 --> 01:14:20,200
you know, nothing to do with police work,

1234
01:14:20,620 --> 01:14:25,620
but there is a feeling that wouldn't it
be nice if in this hour I were able to

1235
01:14:26,081 --> 01:14:29,590
figure something out? Because if
you want understand string theory,

1236
01:14:29,950 --> 01:14:31,210
you're not going to do it an hour.

1237
01:14:31,370 --> 01:14:34,130
You're not going to do it
ever. Those guys understand it.

1238
01:14:34,131 --> 01:14:38,720
Even if they T precisely, let's take an
easier one. Let's take a candle flame.

1239
01:14:39,020 --> 01:14:39,790
You're never gonna know

1240
01:14:39,790 --> 01:14:43,380
STEM at, right. Uh, studying
that forever. And there's,

1241
01:14:43,440 --> 01:14:48,440
there's an area where conspiracy theories
are exercising the muscles of logic,

1242
01:14:51,060 --> 01:14:54,210
exercising the muscles of skepticism,

1243
01:14:54,930 --> 01:14:59,880
playing around with the,
with the haiku of if then,

1244
01:14:59,970 --> 01:15:02,920
if then playing around with, um,

1245
01:15:03,840 --> 01:15:08,430
what we feel about the government
and other people and stuff like that.

1246
01:15:08,700 --> 01:15:13,700
And you're playing around with all of
that in kind of a semi safe zone and even

1247
01:15:17,341 --> 01:15:20,780
watching you just do it
here, where you will, you,

1248
01:15:20,940 --> 01:15:23,160
will you bang out that stuff
and say, this is the stuff.

1249
01:15:23,161 --> 01:15:28,090
I questioned what's coming out of
that poetically. Uh, and I thought,

1250
01:15:28,140 --> 01:15:30,480
let's not even talk about whether
we went to the moon or not.

1251
01:15:30,750 --> 01:15:35,460
What's coming out of your style
of inquiry on that kind of thing.

1252
01:15:35,461 --> 01:15:40,440
Your style of skepticism is
just fascinating and beautiful.

1253
01:15:40,590 --> 01:15:45,590
And I see the conspiracy thing
as not so much a breaking down,

1254
01:15:45,990 --> 01:15:50,010
which I used to see it as a
breaking down of science and reason,

1255
01:15:50,250 --> 01:15:54,450
but I see it as rather a, a
creation of a new form of poetry.

1256
01:15:55,130 --> 01:15:58,380
That's weird. I don't know if my daughter
just said, my daughter just says,

1257
01:15:58,381 --> 01:16:02,430
you know, I really like conspiracy
theories and I say to her,

1258
01:16:03,120 --> 01:16:06,390
you know, Paul McCartney's still
alive. Right? But you know,

1259
01:16:06,391 --> 01:16:08,610
she's 14 and your pen Gillette let,

1260
01:16:08,610 --> 01:16:13,410
so she's rebelling. You understand
that, right? You're a parent,

1261
01:16:13,440 --> 01:16:18,300
you know, it's like your baby just
told me something really important.

1262
01:16:18,420 --> 01:16:21,090
Yeah, there's two dirt down the
real life. Here's the thing,

1263
01:16:21,091 --> 01:16:24,870
it's like Neil Gaiman's
daughter coming in, uh,

1264
01:16:24,960 --> 01:16:29,670
all golfed out and you'll say to her,
I invented this. You can't do this.

1265
01:16:29,850 --> 01:16:33,960
This is not the way you can rebel.
You can't rebel against me like this.

1266
01:16:34,440 --> 01:16:37,710
You can't do it with black hair
and eye shadow, you can't do it.

1267
01:16:38,910 --> 01:16:43,840
But yeah. Yeah. Well kids, you know,
they, they find their own way and they,

1268
01:16:43,841 --> 01:16:47,190
they want to express themselves, you know,

1269
01:16:47,250 --> 01:16:49,740
they want to exert power over their world.

1270
01:16:49,860 --> 01:16:52,560
But did you see that article that
you were mentioning? No, I did not.

1271
01:16:52,970 --> 01:16:55,040
I try not to read anything
that I mentioned that,

1272
01:16:55,041 --> 01:16:58,170
I mean I briefly do
oftentimes. And I'm like, huh,

1273
01:16:58,530 --> 01:17:02,310
I tried to never read anything with my
name in it because it's not written for

1274
01:17:02,311 --> 01:17:03,144
us. Right.

1275
01:17:03,150 --> 01:17:07,560
And I'll tell you the exact moment that
happened to me that was so great. Uh,

1276
01:17:08,010 --> 01:17:10,070
it was in the 80s were on Broadway

1277
01:17:10,610 --> 01:17:15,230
and, uh, I, the cone brothers were
just starting to do movies, you know,

1278
01:17:15,231 --> 01:17:19,370
and I was really interested in
them, you know, and uh, I had,

1279
01:17:19,490 --> 01:17:20,900
I had like an hour fray,

1280
01:17:20,930 --> 01:17:24,770
which when I was doing stern and
Letterman and Saturday night live and on

1281
01:17:24,771 --> 01:17:29,350
Broadway, I never had an hour free.
And I was a magazine, like vanity fair,

1282
01:17:29,360 --> 01:17:30,740
something, who cares? Fuck what it was.

1283
01:17:31,010 --> 01:17:32,930
And has said what the cone
brothers are really like,

1284
01:17:32,931 --> 01:17:35,490
what it's like to work with the
cone brothers. Okay. And I said, ah,

1285
01:17:35,650 --> 01:17:36,650
I'd never read magazine,

1286
01:17:36,780 --> 01:17:39,380
but a by this I'll learn a little bit
about the Cohen brothers on up to our

1287
01:17:39,381 --> 01:17:42,500
office. You know, it's like the
Brill building, you know, uh,

1288
01:17:42,530 --> 01:17:45,890
Lauren Michaels sit in
my office, open it up,

1289
01:17:45,891 --> 01:17:48,050
put the cone brothers like
turn to that page. I said,

1290
01:17:48,350 --> 01:17:50,930
if you want to know what
the Cohen brothers are like,

1291
01:17:51,140 --> 01:17:54,860
it's like hanging out with
Penn and teller. And I went,

1292
01:17:58,990 --> 01:18:01,010
Whoa, Whoa, Whoa.

1293
01:18:03,870 --> 01:18:08,030
How does that even real close
the bag of seed? Put it aside.

1294
01:18:08,031 --> 01:18:12,770
And they were going on comparing it and
I went, I have no information on this.

1295
01:18:12,800 --> 01:18:16,670
None. There's no way I can access
it. Then that moment I went, Oh,

1296
01:18:16,671 --> 01:18:17,504
wait a minute.

1297
01:18:17,690 --> 01:18:22,040
When it says Penn Jillette
in an article or in a book,

1298
01:18:22,940 --> 01:18:27,670
there's no way I can understand
that. Maybe others can, you know.

1299
01:18:27,800 --> 01:18:31,400
So when it says in the
article, um, you know,

1300
01:18:31,401 --> 01:18:34,370
when Joe Rogan does conspiracy stuff,
duh, duh, duh, duh duh duh duh,

1301
01:18:34,580 --> 01:18:37,730
you can't understand that. It's
like Mike Desmond said to me,

1302
01:18:37,850 --> 01:18:42,850
the major problem with talking to
Jimmy Hendrix was he never heard Jimmy

1303
01:18:43,130 --> 01:18:47,480
Hendrix. He never saw Jimmy Hendrix
on stage. He couldn't. And you know,

1304
01:18:47,570 --> 01:18:51,830
so you are the one person that using
Joe Rogan is an example, you know?

1305
01:18:52,160 --> 01:18:55,940
Well you know, kind of a Brola Terry kind
of a kind of a does this bro culture.

1306
01:18:55,941 --> 01:18:57,950
This is Joe. You can't understand that.

1307
01:18:58,190 --> 01:19:00,890
You have no idea what that means
cause you're an individual.

1308
01:19:01,170 --> 01:19:04,730
Well it's also people are trying to
encapsulate you by those brief moments and

1309
01:19:04,731 --> 01:19:07,560
might've seen a video or heard you talk
about what it means something to other

1310
01:19:07,561 --> 01:19:09,810
people. It means something. And it also,

1311
01:19:10,110 --> 01:19:15,060
you can easily categorize someone and
put them in this box and now I've defined

1312
01:19:15,061 --> 01:19:16,170
that, Oh, I know what that is.

1313
01:19:16,200 --> 01:19:19,320
Let's see what else before hanging
out with Penn Jillette. Yeah.

1314
01:19:19,410 --> 01:19:22,410
It's also part of your
job, part of your job.

1315
01:19:22,411 --> 01:19:27,390
One of the things you've created is you've
created something in the culture that

1316
01:19:27,391 --> 01:19:32,391
means the New York times can say Joe Rogan
and are people reading that know what

1317
01:19:33,631 --> 01:19:37,920
that means. But there's no way Joe Rogan
can know what that you can pretend,

1318
01:19:38,380 --> 01:19:40,800
right? Well, you could be like
Trump and get mad about it.

1319
01:19:42,690 --> 01:19:45,390
You know where the rubber really hits
the road with conspiracy theories right

1320
01:19:45,391 --> 01:19:48,770
now, Jeffrey Epstein. Oh yeah. That's
the where the rubber hits the road.

1321
01:19:48,780 --> 01:19:53,670
That's where people that are not
conspiratorial minded are like, wait,

1322
01:19:53,700 --> 01:19:57,270
what the fuck is going on? What
all the cameras were bad? Oh,

1323
01:19:57,390 --> 01:20:01,500
that guy was on suicide watch. He tried
to commit suicide and then they're like,

1324
01:20:01,501 --> 01:20:03,870
well, don't do that
again. And then he did it.

1325
01:20:04,200 --> 01:20:07,740
Like if you talk to people that have
been locked up, they'd take away, man,

1326
01:20:08,170 --> 01:20:09,480
you've been on suicide watch.

1327
01:20:09,630 --> 01:20:12,650
They fucking take away
everything and you find this guy,

1328
01:20:12,780 --> 01:20:17,130
he's got a broken neck and
he hung himself. Like how?
How did he hang himself?

1329
01:20:17,430 --> 01:20:18,930
Can we see the video footage? Oh, sorry.

1330
01:20:18,931 --> 01:20:23,310
The cameras are broken and yourself
is wicked hard. It's not easy.

1331
01:20:24,150 --> 01:20:27,590
It's not easy. It's not easy when
you're in a jail. And they told me, Oh,

1332
01:20:28,140 --> 01:20:30,570
have you been to jail? No,
no, no. Never been in jail.

1333
01:20:30,600 --> 01:20:34,470
I was only in jail over night. But I mean
they, if you're on suicide watch, man,

1334
01:20:34,471 --> 01:20:37,750
they make it hard for you to kill
yourself. They watch you and if your,

1335
01:20:37,870 --> 01:20:39,680
is that what? Suicide watch beans. Yes.

1336
01:20:40,580 --> 01:20:42,750
They watch you so you can't
kill yourself again. That's the,

1337
01:20:42,751 --> 01:20:44,440
they watch you every 30 minutes or so.

1338
01:20:44,441 --> 01:20:48,270
What the fuck was this psychologist
thinking that took this guy off suicide

1339
01:20:48,271 --> 01:20:51,270
watch? Literally a couple of weeks
after he tried to commit suicide.

1340
01:20:51,480 --> 01:20:53,490
If someone tries to
commit suicide, you know,

1341
01:20:53,491 --> 01:20:57,370
not speaking as a guy who's had
friends commit suicide, why?

1342
01:20:57,450 --> 01:21:01,020
They're fucking thinking about
it for years, man. Some of them,

1343
01:21:01,021 --> 01:21:04,590
they go back and forth day to day. Some
of them, some of them just do. Yes,

1344
01:21:04,650 --> 01:21:08,790
some of them just do that. But
when someone does actively try it,

1345
01:21:09,180 --> 01:21:13,860
they're not gonna just be fine while
they're in fucking prison awaiting trial

1346
01:21:13,861 --> 01:21:15,600
for having sex with kids.

1347
01:21:15,750 --> 01:21:20,750
It seems like Jeffrey Epstein's life was
going to get really worse from what it

1348
01:21:21,511 --> 01:21:22,770
was few months before.

1349
01:21:22,860 --> 01:21:26,370
Could be or other people's lives are
going to get really worse because Jeffrey

1350
01:21:26,370 --> 01:21:29,670
Epstein's now in jail and they're digging
deep into his past and well when we

1351
01:21:29,671 --> 01:21:32,730
flew with them 26 times, 26 times,

1352
01:21:32,731 --> 01:21:34,800
and ain't a lot of
times to fly with a guy.

1353
01:21:35,010 --> 01:21:38,250
I don't understand what the
big deal is. We flew in a Chet,

1354
01:21:38,280 --> 01:21:42,030
we rode a bus together. He was on
the back of my bike. Do you know,

1355
01:21:42,031 --> 01:21:45,900
do you know people that know Jeffrey
Epstein? Yes. Yeah, yeah. I do think too.

1356
01:21:46,080 --> 01:21:51,060
And a lot of them, uh, it really
was that, yeah. Talk to him,

1357
01:21:51,210 --> 01:21:54,510
well hung out a little bit. There's many
people that feel like he was an agent,

1358
01:21:55,310 --> 01:21:55,410
uh,

1359
01:21:55,410 --> 01:21:58,680
and that he was trying to compromise
people and that's one of the things about

1360
01:21:58,681 --> 01:22:02,400
this whole Lolita Island thing is
that they would compromise people.

1361
01:22:02,401 --> 01:22:06,270
They would compromise people by having a
bunch of young girls who are very sexy,

1362
01:22:06,420 --> 01:22:11,010
who were hired to go and flirt and
maybe even have sex with people and that

1363
01:22:11,011 --> 01:22:15,390
these people were young. These girls were
like 17 under age, perhaps under age,

1364
01:22:15,770 --> 01:22:17,760
some places perhaps not
under age, other places,

1365
01:22:17,970 --> 01:22:21,610
but in incredibly
embarrassing and you know for,

1366
01:22:21,650 --> 01:22:25,020
for the people and agent
compromise for home. Who knows?

1367
01:22:25,290 --> 01:22:26,850
I mean there's a lot of thoughts,

1368
01:22:26,851 --> 01:22:29,700
but that's one of the things about
when he got arrested, the the,

1369
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:32,160
was it the prosecutor or
whoever was it cut him.

1370
01:22:32,161 --> 01:22:35,130
The deal literally was quoted as saying,

1371
01:22:35,370 --> 01:22:39,510
I was told he's above my pay grade
and that he was intelligence.

1372
01:22:40,680 --> 01:22:43,740
That's the quote. Really the intelligence
thing. Try to find that quote. Yeah.

1373
01:22:43,890 --> 01:22:45,180
Try to find that quote. Yes.

1374
01:22:45,330 --> 01:22:49,560
The guy said this was when he gave
him a lenient sentence many years ago,

1375
01:22:50,140 --> 01:22:54,720
Shelly 12 or something. No one seems
to know how he got his money. Well,

1376
01:22:54,780 --> 01:22:58,500
the fucking $70 million penthouse that
he had in Manhattan was given to him.

1377
01:22:58,560 --> 01:23:02,300
Right. Given to him, who the fuck gives
someone a $70 million house? Well,

1378
01:23:02,670 --> 01:23:05,680
I was kind of hoping you would
to me. I don't have one. Okay.

1379
01:23:06,130 --> 01:23:08,410
If I have a bunch of them, I'd
give you one. I got it wrong.

1380
01:23:08,450 --> 01:23:13,360
You gotta go now I'm just joking. I was
here to give a $70 million house. Oh,

1381
01:23:13,361 --> 01:23:16,540
you were told wrong. Yeah.
Yeah. I mean I think the guy,

1382
01:23:17,890 --> 01:23:19,240
I think they are, look,

1383
01:23:19,600 --> 01:23:24,580
I've talked to people many times that
work for intelligence agencies and there's

1384
01:23:24,581 --> 01:23:27,880
a lot of weird shit that they do and
one of the things that they do to

1385
01:23:27,881 --> 01:23:32,881
compromise people as they get them
involved in weird stuff that could be very

1386
01:23:33,821 --> 01:23:38,170
bad for them if it comes out and then
they have influence over this person.

1387
01:23:38,410 --> 01:23:41,170
And if you got a guy with a
voracious sexual appetite,

1388
01:23:41,260 --> 01:23:44,770
I mean there's a few of those fellows
out there and you know, Hey man,

1389
01:23:45,130 --> 01:23:48,730
proud of that. Archie, I'm out off
now. I'm going fucking hanging out,

1390
01:23:48,731 --> 01:23:52,720
having a good time with Jeffrey and we're
just flat around. I mean, come on man,

1391
01:23:52,750 --> 01:23:54,430
it's, it's, it's highly likely.

1392
01:23:54,460 --> 01:23:59,020
One of the guys that I know that knew him
was also a freak, like a sexual freak.

1393
01:23:59,050 --> 01:24:02,460
And I'm like, okay, I think, I think
I see a pattern here. This the,

1394
01:24:02,560 --> 01:24:05,590
it's very likely that
that's what was going on.

1395
01:24:05,770 --> 01:24:10,770
This guy was compromising people and
probably absolutely a sex addict himself.

1396
01:24:10,990 --> 01:24:14,800
And I believe all the women that say all
the horrible things that he did to them

1397
01:24:14,801 --> 01:24:18,640
and hired them for things and had
underage girls do sexual things with him.

1398
01:24:19,000 --> 01:24:22,480
It's probably true. It's probably true.
He's probably a fucked up twisted dude.

1399
01:24:22,481 --> 01:24:26,140
But many people that are involved,
even in good things get compromised.

1400
01:24:26,141 --> 01:24:30,280
Like there's many people that work
for the CIA that were legitimate CIA

1401
01:24:30,281 --> 01:24:33,880
operatives who wound up selling drugs.
This, there's a lot of this happens.

1402
01:24:33,940 --> 01:24:38,080
People go sideways, people get in
involved in shady activity that are cops.

1403
01:24:38,200 --> 01:24:42,370
There's cops that wind up doing illegal
things. They signed on to be a cop,

1404
01:24:42,520 --> 01:24:42,871
to be a,

1405
01:24:42,871 --> 01:24:46,120
a person who's going to serve and
protect and be involved in the community.

1406
01:24:46,121 --> 01:24:49,690
And slowly but surely they get compromised
and they get involved in illegal

1407
01:24:49,691 --> 01:24:52,870
activity. And the next thing you
know, they're corrupt. That happens.

1408
01:24:52,960 --> 01:24:56,950
It happens. And then sometimes
people's fucking suicide themselves,

1409
01:24:57,180 --> 01:25:01,150
the people that, uh, that
I know that knew him,

1410
01:25:01,600 --> 01:25:02,890
it was a,

1411
01:25:03,640 --> 01:25:06,850
they weren't even aware
of the CD stuff going on.

1412
01:25:07,060 --> 01:25:09,860
So of course that's going to
be true too. Well, he was a,

1413
01:25:09,970 --> 01:25:14,560
it'd be 100% he was also a champion of
science. I mean a champion. Yes, he,

1414
01:25:15,160 --> 01:25:19,140
but that's the thing about people.
They can be really good. Sure.

1415
01:25:19,240 --> 01:25:21,790
In some ways and horrible in other ways.

1416
01:25:21,910 --> 01:25:25,150
This idea that people are buying or
you're one or a zero is nonsense.

1417
01:25:25,510 --> 01:25:27,760
There's really good people
that do terrible things.

1418
01:25:27,760 --> 01:25:31,510
There's really terrible people that also
do good things. You know, like look,

1419
01:25:31,570 --> 01:25:34,840
fucking Trump just passed something
and no one wants to give him credit for

1420
01:25:34,841 --> 01:25:37,180
this. He stuff was the
kidney stones. He did.

1421
01:25:37,181 --> 01:25:41,080
He did wonderful stuff for
kidney transplant stuff.
I'm sure he pushed through,

1422
01:25:41,360 --> 01:25:45,310
well that was going to say
that he absorbed all the
student loans for disabled

1423
01:25:45,311 --> 01:25:47,500
veterans. [inaudible]
fantastic. I love it.

1424
01:25:47,530 --> 01:25:49,660
You don't hear a word about
it and where to praise. Look,

1425
01:25:49,661 --> 01:25:53,020
we should absolve student loans for
fucking everyone. We're crippling kids.

1426
01:25:53,140 --> 01:25:54,970
We're crippling the 17,

1427
01:25:54,971 --> 01:25:58,210
18 year old kids who sign up for these
fucking loans and they get compromised to

1428
01:25:58,211 --> 01:26:01,690
the point where we have people to this
day right now that are getting their

1429
01:26:01,691 --> 01:26:03,160
social security,

1430
01:26:04,140 --> 01:26:07,640
their social security money's getting
docked because they owe student loans.

1431
01:26:07,970 --> 01:26:11,830
They're at the end of the fucking road.
But what do you do? What do you do? Uh,

1432
01:26:12,020 --> 01:26:14,300
and this is a real question.
This is not rhetorical.

1433
01:26:14,780 --> 01:26:17,180
What do you do about
the feeling of fairness?

1434
01:26:17,240 --> 01:26:21,770
The people that work their way
through college waiting tables?

1435
01:26:21,830 --> 01:26:25,550
That's a good question. Working
really hard. And then they, uh,

1436
01:26:26,450 --> 01:26:30,890
we just say their feelings,
which I think is valid,

1437
01:26:31,220 --> 01:26:35,480
which is, yeah, yeah, you got fucked on
this, but let's help someone else out.

1438
01:26:35,481 --> 01:26:39,110
What did we hear? Compassion.
Here's the cause. You know, um, uh,

1439
01:26:39,320 --> 01:26:43,730
there are people that worked really hard
to not have student loans and there are

1440
01:26:43,731 --> 01:26:45,170
people that took them. Um,

1441
01:26:45,920 --> 01:26:50,420
there has to be somebody who took them
prevalently 100%. I think quite a few.

1442
01:26:50,570 --> 01:26:51,680
And I think it's also,

1443
01:26:52,220 --> 01:26:55,940
we also should pay attention to the human
mind and the development of the human

1444
01:26:55,941 --> 01:26:57,170
mind in the frontal cortex.

1445
01:26:57,200 --> 01:27:00,890
And the frontal lobe does not develop
properly until you're 25 years old. Right.

1446
01:27:01,420 --> 01:27:03,770
So some somewhere in that
roster minus four years,

1447
01:27:03,771 --> 01:27:05,870
definitely out 17 it's
definitely not 18 months.

1448
01:27:05,871 --> 01:27:07,840
So you're taking on these
fucking loans. You, you,

1449
01:27:07,990 --> 01:27:12,530
you can't be trusted with money or your
future or thinking about what the fuck

1450
01:27:12,531 --> 01:27:15,510
you're doing in terms of like taking
on a debt of hundreds of thousands.

1451
01:27:15,740 --> 01:27:19,290
We have to, and this also
ties in, um, uh, with,

1452
01:27:19,370 --> 01:27:21,470
with bisexual stuff as well.

1453
01:27:21,950 --> 01:27:26,810
Don't we have to decide when someone's
adult and then give them that respect?

1454
01:27:26,870 --> 01:27:30,050
Yes. We have to say you're 18 years old.

1455
01:27:30,660 --> 01:27:34,950
We can't control what decisions
you make. Yes. Does that,

1456
01:27:35,270 --> 01:27:39,560
you're going to be, cause I think 25 is
too old. I think 25 is too old as well.

1457
01:27:39,730 --> 01:27:40,380
Yeah. But I think

1458
01:27:40,380 --> 01:27:41,820
we're saying is, I mean look,

1459
01:27:41,821 --> 01:27:44,480
there's a lot of 18 year old people that
make very good moral decisions. Yes.

1460
01:27:44,670 --> 01:27:46,320
And we should, we should praise that.

1461
01:27:46,680 --> 01:27:49,430
Here's the problem with the student
loan thing, in terms of the fee,

1462
01:27:49,620 --> 01:27:54,360
that's the only loans that
you never get exonerated from.

1463
01:27:55,500 --> 01:27:59,820
You can get bankruptcy, right? And
you can get exonerated. You can,

1464
01:27:59,850 --> 01:28:03,240
you could escape the
loans of credit cards,

1465
01:28:03,300 --> 01:28:05,430
the debt of mortgages.

1466
01:28:05,460 --> 01:28:10,460
You could escape a bad business collapsing
and owing millions and whatever you

1467
01:28:10,591 --> 01:28:12,180
get. You could escape
that through bankruptcy.

1468
01:28:12,480 --> 01:28:15,150
You cannot do that with student
loans. It's a corrupt system.

1469
01:28:15,660 --> 01:28:20,660
You take a child who's trying to learn
a trade or trying to learn a profession

1470
01:28:21,510 --> 01:28:26,510
and you acquire insane debt that's going
to track you and cripple you for the

1471
01:28:27,241 --> 01:28:29,690
rest of your life. And no
matter what happens to you,

1472
01:28:29,730 --> 01:28:30,600
you owe that money.

1473
01:28:30,750 --> 01:28:34,840
But also you're taking your
colleges out of the free market too,

1474
01:28:35,340 --> 01:28:39,270
by giving those, by giving
those loans easily. Yes.

1475
01:28:39,300 --> 01:28:41,470
And by having government help. Yes.

1476
01:28:42,150 --> 01:28:45,690
So you're also taking away the
free market because you know,

1477
01:28:45,900 --> 01:28:50,580
we found out that when you put the
free market in, like play six surgery,

1478
01:28:50,640 --> 01:28:54,480
when insurance doesn't cover it,
it gets wicked cheap. You know?

1479
01:28:54,690 --> 01:28:59,690
And if colleges had to be paid as people
went without easy loans to get and

1480
01:29:01,080 --> 01:29:02,190
colleges did not

1481
01:29:02,190 --> 01:29:05,100
get government money, they
might be wicked cheaper.

1482
01:29:05,390 --> 01:29:08,210
I think that will be
really, really expensive.

1483
01:29:08,240 --> 01:29:10,400
I think [inaudible] crazy expensive.

1484
01:29:10,430 --> 01:29:15,430
I think the real solution is in treating
education like a thing that's going to

1485
01:29:15,941 --> 01:29:17,270
make our society better.

1486
01:29:17,690 --> 01:29:21,320
And think of it as the same way we
think about the fire department.

1487
01:29:21,470 --> 01:29:23,090
Same way you think
about police department,

1488
01:29:23,120 --> 01:29:26,330
that, I mean when you read the paper,

1489
01:29:26,900 --> 01:29:30,950
there's always one whole thing about
colleges getting too expensive and people

1490
01:29:30,951 --> 01:29:31,980
can't go do they need to.

1491
01:29:32,330 --> 01:29:37,330
And then you turn 20 pages later in the
paper and there's an article about how

1492
01:29:37,371 --> 01:29:41,380
online learning is going to happen is
happening and all of this stuff is going

1493
01:29:41,381 --> 01:29:41,960
to happen.

1494
01:29:41,960 --> 01:29:45,650
Do you think that that idea of college
is going to hold up for another 10 years?

1495
01:29:45,800 --> 01:29:48,020
I think there's an experience that
people, I mean, did you go to college?

1496
01:29:48,230 --> 01:29:52,790
Well, I did, but I went to college in
my town. I went to UMass Boston and uh,

1497
01:29:52,791 --> 01:29:55,790
I really only went because
I didn't want to be a loser.

1498
01:29:56,250 --> 01:29:58,250
It was really all it was. I was, uh,

1499
01:29:58,580 --> 01:30:02,270
doing martial arts and
fighting and traveling all
over the world or all over the

1500
01:30:02,271 --> 01:30:05,900
country rather. And, and thinking about
doing standup at the time as well.

1501
01:30:05,901 --> 01:30:09,230
And then transitioning to doing stand up
while I was also still taking classes.

1502
01:30:09,740 --> 01:30:12,470
I was learning nothing. It
was a complete waste of time.

1503
01:30:12,471 --> 01:30:15,830
I was only doing it so I could say
yeah, taking classes at UMass Boston,

1504
01:30:15,850 --> 01:30:19,730
I was barely paying attention,
barely showing up. And um,

1505
01:30:19,880 --> 01:30:23,780
it was just a thing that I didn't want
to tell people that I wasn't going to

1506
01:30:23,781 --> 01:30:27,680
college. Like that was the number one
reason why I did it, but I, but that was,

1507
01:30:27,830 --> 01:30:31,520
I had a unique life from the
time I was, uh, you know,

1508
01:30:31,521 --> 01:30:34,620
graduating from high school to
the time I started doing standup.

1509
01:30:34,640 --> 01:30:38,000
I was obsessed with martial
arts and competing and
that's all I wanted to do was

1510
01:30:38,001 --> 01:30:40,970
make the Olympic team for TaeKwonDo.
That's what, that was my goal.

1511
01:30:40,971 --> 01:30:44,300
And that's what I was trying to
do. So I wasn't a normal person.

1512
01:30:44,301 --> 01:30:48,700
I wasn't like I wasn't going to go to
Ohio and fucking travel over there and

1513
01:30:48,710 --> 01:30:51,590
take a full course load and not
be able to pursue what I wanted,

1514
01:30:51,950 --> 01:30:52,783
what I wanted to do.

1515
01:30:53,010 --> 01:30:56,830
And also you've got a window
[inaudible] yeah. Politically that's it.

1516
01:30:57,110 --> 01:30:57,710
It's fairly,

1517
01:30:57,710 --> 01:31:02,230
and there's no, there was no scholarships
for TaeKwonDo goes and doesn't,

1518
01:31:02,231 --> 01:31:05,810
it didn't exist. And the only other
option was the army. There was a dude,

1519
01:31:06,280 --> 01:31:07,590
I think his name was clay barbers,

1520
01:31:07,720 --> 01:31:10,370
this really talented guy who
was a fighter who was, uh,

1521
01:31:10,390 --> 01:31:12,920
on the U S team at one
point in time, I think.

1522
01:31:12,921 --> 01:31:16,190
And he was a competing
through the army. Like they,

1523
01:31:16,370 --> 01:31:18,650
they had subsidized his
training somehow or another.

1524
01:31:18,651 --> 01:31:20,930
And I was thinking maybe I should
join the army like those, the other,

1525
01:31:21,140 --> 01:31:25,070
the only other thing that I was thinking
about doing. But um, for people,

1526
01:31:25,071 --> 01:31:27,230
I think there's a thing about
getting away from your parents,

1527
01:31:27,440 --> 01:31:29,960
getting away from them, getting
away from their influence,

1528
01:31:29,961 --> 01:31:32,690
being wild and crazy and be with a
bunch of other kids and trying to find

1529
01:31:32,691 --> 01:31:36,920
yourself. And I think that comes from
traveling to a place and going to college.

1530
01:31:37,280 --> 01:31:39,290
And I think there's, there's
some benefit in that.

1531
01:31:39,340 --> 01:31:43,490
And I have friends that have had great
benefit in that sort of a transformative

1532
01:31:43,491 --> 01:31:45,320
experience of being on a campus,

1533
01:31:45,321 --> 01:31:48,950
a physical campus in a place that's
outside of their hometown where it gives

1534
01:31:48,951 --> 01:31:51,390
them this new experience where
they get to try to reinvent.

1535
01:31:51,550 --> 01:31:53,480
There's no doubt about
that. Yeah. People do that.

1536
01:31:53,690 --> 01:31:57,950
Being able to be someone else. But
I wonder, I wonder if all of that,

1537
01:31:58,310 --> 01:32:00,070
why are we giving that a four

1538
01:32:00,070 --> 01:32:04,720
year period? Why isn't that our whole
lives? It can, it could be and should be.

1539
01:32:04,721 --> 01:32:06,580
And isn't that the way
that's going to change?

1540
01:32:06,790 --> 01:32:09,580
Cause people aren't having jobs for
the whole life anymore. And by the way,

1541
01:32:09,940 --> 01:32:14,520
the liberal arts education was never
supposed to teach people a trade. Right.

1542
01:32:14,590 --> 01:32:19,590
It was always supposed to make it so that
young men could talk in it at parties.

1543
01:32:21,240 --> 01:32:23,710
Yeah. That was the idea. We can
have the same cultural thing.

1544
01:32:23,711 --> 01:32:26,320
We can tell about Shakespeare, we can
talk about this, we can talk about that.

1545
01:32:26,530 --> 01:32:30,760
But none of this was meant to give
people jobs. Well, it's so rigid, right?

1546
01:32:30,761 --> 01:32:32,090
You get out of high school,

1547
01:32:32,120 --> 01:32:35,560
high school was this torturous affair
where you're being a square peg,

1548
01:32:35,561 --> 01:32:37,180
they're trying to shove into a round hole.

1549
01:32:37,181 --> 01:32:40,300
Then you get out and then they fly off
to wherever the fuck you're going to go

1550
01:32:40,301 --> 01:32:45,301
to school and you go there and you're
forced with this overbearing workload of

1551
01:32:45,551 --> 01:32:48,190
school and then social things.

1552
01:32:48,190 --> 01:32:51,280
You're trying to figure out what's okay
and what's not okay now where's the safe

1553
01:32:51,281 --> 01:32:53,590
space and what am I, what am I?

1554
01:32:53,591 --> 01:32:56,560
Am I allowed to say this and
am I allowed to say that?

1555
01:32:56,561 --> 01:32:59,590
And what are the new rules now for this
new generation and where are we really

1556
01:32:59,740 --> 01:33:00,573
gonna change the world.

1557
01:33:00,640 --> 01:33:03,040
And then all the sudden you're out in
the world and you realize that fucking

1558
01:33:03,160 --> 01:33:07,660
money that you spent or that loan that
you got is not getting you a job and

1559
01:33:07,661 --> 01:33:11,320
you're fucked and you can't get a job
and you're also massively in debt and

1560
01:33:11,321 --> 01:33:14,530
severely depressed and trying to
figure out your future. I mean,

1561
01:33:14,810 --> 01:33:16,920
Missy go on Adderall and you're like,

1562
01:33:18,710 --> 01:33:21,850
we're setting people up. We're setting
people up for a horrible failure.

1563
01:33:21,880 --> 01:33:25,660
I am with Bernie Sanders in that I think
education should be free and I don't

1564
01:33:25,661 --> 01:33:27,430
think that's a bad thing.
I think as you burn it,

1565
01:33:27,460 --> 01:33:28,480
I think you should have to earn it.

1566
01:33:28,630 --> 01:33:32,470
How bout if education is really cheap?

1567
01:33:32,620 --> 01:33:36,310
Like everything else is getting cheaper,
ma? Well, I mean TVs are really cheap.

1568
01:33:37,600 --> 01:33:38,433
[inaudible] more expensive.

1569
01:33:38,470 --> 01:33:41,560
I think we could pay for it with taxes
or maybe wrong or the individuals could

1570
01:33:41,561 --> 01:33:44,350
pay for maybe the individuals
because cheap and if it made sense,

1571
01:33:44,351 --> 01:33:45,184
if it made sense.

1572
01:33:45,230 --> 01:33:49,030
I mean if you want to learn
something now we know this very well.

1573
01:33:49,180 --> 01:33:54,040
If you want to learn anything now
you can get it for free on the web.

1574
01:33:54,070 --> 01:33:57,730
You definitely can do many things.
I mean other than physical things,

1575
01:33:57,940 --> 01:34:00,730
there's a lot of physical things that
you need to be taught by a coach,

1576
01:34:01,080 --> 01:34:04,180
but I think there's a lot of things you
can learn online and even the physical

1577
01:34:04,181 --> 01:34:09,160
things, you can get a big chunk of it
from online tutorials. I mean let's,

1578
01:34:09,190 --> 01:34:12,430
let's talk about all that matters. Okay.
Let's talk about juggling. You know,

1579
01:34:12,850 --> 01:34:15,760
I grew up as a juggler when
you were doing the TaeKwonDo,

1580
01:34:15,761 --> 01:34:17,170
I was juggling all the time.

1581
01:34:17,470 --> 01:34:20,410
That's all I did and that was
my whole life was juggling.

1582
01:34:20,740 --> 01:34:25,740
And what happened was with the internet
juggling gut tremendously better because

1583
01:34:26,711 --> 01:34:31,120
people could watch videos of things they
knew were possible and get better if

1584
01:34:31,121 --> 01:34:34,210
juggling get better.
Physics certainly can.

1585
01:34:34,540 --> 01:34:39,540
It seems like you can take a course at
any college online and if you sincerely

1586
01:34:39,671 --> 01:34:43,510
want to learn, you know, I don't know
if we need to have this, what is,

1587
01:34:43,530 --> 01:34:44,890
what does the term called when the,

1588
01:34:44,891 --> 01:34:49,891
when the Amish take their one year of
Rumpelstiltskin assessment from spring

1589
01:34:51,560 --> 01:34:52,150
program spring.

1590
01:34:52,150 --> 01:34:57,150
I don't think we need a nationally tax
subsidized Rumspringa for every person

1591
01:34:58,090 --> 01:35:01,310
in the country. I don't see what it
is. Right? Yeah. You go to college,

1592
01:35:01,560 --> 01:35:04,010
well you just described we do
the dah, dah, dah, dah, dah.

1593
01:35:04,070 --> 01:35:06,620
It seems like live your fucking life.

1594
01:35:06,860 --> 01:35:11,720
There isn't this four year magic period
or there's two year magic period and go

1595
01:35:11,721 --> 01:35:15,500
out and learn the stuff you want
to learn. I mean, um, you know,

1596
01:35:15,501 --> 01:35:18,530
we both have children and they'll be
talking about going to college and of

1597
01:35:18,531 --> 01:35:20,900
course my, my, well not of course,

1598
01:35:20,901 --> 01:35:25,880
but my wife will push very hard for
college and my thinking is anything they

1599
01:35:25,881 --> 01:35:29,440
want to learn they can, they can
just learn it. Yeah. You know,

1600
01:35:29,990 --> 01:35:30,890
by the way,

1601
01:35:31,190 --> 01:35:35,660
this was also true with just
the libraries in local towns.

1602
01:35:35,960 --> 01:35:38,880
It's just more true now. It's
even easier now. You know,

1603
01:35:39,530 --> 01:35:43,230
I can't imagine growing up where my,

1604
01:35:43,260 --> 01:35:47,300
my son can type in Lenny Bruce and
it all just pops up. Right? I mean,

1605
01:35:47,301 --> 01:35:49,950
that was amazing. Store
order it, order it.

1606
01:35:50,630 --> 01:35:53,600
They didn't grip into Griffin's
music store in Greenfield,

1607
01:35:53,601 --> 01:35:58,160
Massachusetts did not have the Carnegie
hall concert right there in the stacks I

1608
01:35:58,161 --> 01:36:02,750
had to order. All right. Frank Zappa
on the back of one of his records.

1609
01:36:02,960 --> 01:36:05,690
Menches Lenny Bruce and
he's on Sergeant pepper.

1610
01:36:05,870 --> 01:36:10,370
I guess I should learn about him.
Um, uh, let me write that down.

1611
01:36:10,371 --> 01:36:12,050
That's how I learned
about Terrence McKenna.

1612
01:36:12,080 --> 01:36:15,060
I learned about Terence McKenna from
listening to a bill Hicks record. Yeah,

1613
01:36:15,120 --> 01:36:20,030
yeah. I was like, who is this McKenna
and what's a heroic dose? And at,

1614
01:36:20,360 --> 01:36:23,540
at Frank Zappa, one of his
records, I forget which it is,

1615
01:36:23,541 --> 01:36:27,200
I think it's freak out, but it might
be absolutely free. Says on the back.

1616
01:36:27,201 --> 01:36:31,910
Do not listen to this song until you've
read Franz Kafka and the penal comedy.

1617
01:36:32,630 --> 01:36:36,380
Ah, I got the record, opened it up.
It said that I listened to one side,

1618
01:36:36,381 --> 01:36:41,330
got to that song, got on my bike, rode
down to the Greenfield public library.

1619
01:36:41,930 --> 01:36:46,310
Kafka. I've got this written down.
Kafka in the penal colony, sat there,

1620
01:36:46,311 --> 01:36:47,900
Reddit went back, listened to the record.

1621
01:36:48,200 --> 01:36:52,790
My entire education starts with Mike
Nesmith of the monkeys who said,

1622
01:36:52,940 --> 01:36:53,810
listen to Zappa,

1623
01:36:53,811 --> 01:36:58,730
listen to Hendrix from Zappa to Lenny
Bruce from Lindy Bruce to the whole world.

1624
01:36:59,450 --> 01:37:01,650
And I believe that, uh,

1625
01:37:01,940 --> 01:37:06,890
that is available to everybody all
the time. I mean, I don't know,

1626
01:37:06,891 --> 01:37:11,540
as I would say tax players should
pay for college. I think I would say,

1627
01:37:11,800 --> 01:37:13,670
did we need college?
Isn't that fade in a way?

1628
01:37:13,910 --> 01:37:17,960
I think there's a real benefit to
being in a classroom with a brilliant

1629
01:37:17,961 --> 01:37:22,430
professor. Yeah. Yeah. I think there is,
but we're also seeing with Ted talks,

1630
01:37:22,431 --> 01:37:27,160
which I know are jive, but there
is a, there's all these, you know,

1631
01:37:27,170 --> 01:37:29,510
their job, you, there can
be a lot of jive Ted talks.

1632
01:37:29,570 --> 01:37:31,280
There's some jive Ted talks. Yeah. Yeah.

1633
01:37:31,430 --> 01:37:36,430
But what I'm saying is I went to
one of the first Ted conferences and

1634
01:37:37,840 --> 01:37:41,190
[inaudible] and got to
hear, um, you know, um,

1635
01:37:42,620 --> 01:37:45,110
all these credible people speaking.

1636
01:37:45,111 --> 01:37:48,680
It was mind blowing and I wasn't
college age. I was, you know,

1637
01:37:48,710 --> 01:37:51,830
I was whatever I was 45 or
something 40. And it was,

1638
01:37:52,190 --> 01:37:56,130
it was an amazing spirit.
Jonas Salk, you know, I sat

1639
01:37:56,130 --> 01:37:57,690
and listened to Jonas salt talk.

1640
01:37:57,700 --> 01:38:02,460
I know I've been in a room with brilliant
people speaking and it's really,

1641
01:38:02,461 --> 01:38:06,570
really great, but I think we can,

1642
01:38:06,600 --> 01:38:08,310
we can deliver that cheaper.

1643
01:38:08,640 --> 01:38:12,900
And that's the side that Bernie
Sanders I want to talk about. It's not,

1644
01:38:13,080 --> 01:38:17,130
can we give endless amounts of money
to these fucking people on college

1645
01:38:17,131 --> 01:38:17,964
campuses?

1646
01:38:17,970 --> 01:38:22,020
Can we pay them all the money in the
world to take our children and give them

1647
01:38:22,021 --> 01:38:25,800
something to do in between smoking
dope? Could we rather just say,

1648
01:38:25,980 --> 01:38:30,480
can't we make this experience cheap enough
so that anybody can go and experience

1649
01:38:30,481 --> 01:38:31,830
it? Why don't you, why?

1650
01:38:31,831 --> 01:38:36,831
Why isn't it possible for you for a
few bucks to go and be in a room with a

1651
01:38:37,201 --> 01:38:38,034
brilliant person?

1652
01:38:38,430 --> 01:38:42,150
I think that would be a thing that would
be beneficial to almost anybody at any

1653
01:38:42,151 --> 01:38:45,780
point in time instead of the rigid
structure of like, you know, this is,

1654
01:38:45,781 --> 01:38:49,110
you know, you have to get all this
work done by X amount of time.

1655
01:38:49,140 --> 01:38:51,080
That's the other thing that
happens to kids too. They're,

1656
01:38:51,130 --> 01:38:56,130
they're taught about having no sleep
and about beating your body up and about

1657
01:38:56,251 --> 01:38:59,550
cramming and about getting all this
work done in a short period of time.

1658
01:38:59,700 --> 01:38:59,911
They're really,

1659
01:38:59,911 --> 01:39:03,270
we're really preparing them for a horrible
job and all this shit that doesn't

1660
01:39:03,271 --> 01:39:05,400
work, you know, all that weird,

1661
01:39:06,070 --> 01:39:10,830
that weird kind of hazing shit that
we do for medical professionals.

1662
01:39:10,831 --> 01:39:12,820
You're going to work for, for a fucking,

1663
01:39:13,170 --> 01:39:17,490
never weren't saying it's terrible for
the patient if we're bad for everybody,

1664
01:39:17,770 --> 01:39:19,680
you know? So my thing,

1665
01:39:19,681 --> 01:39:23,010
you just made the argument about the
frontal cortex and you're not really ready

1666
01:39:23,011 --> 01:39:23,900
to your 25 [inaudible].

1667
01:39:24,090 --> 01:39:28,920
What are the huge advantages I had in
my life was a shitty, shitty education,

1668
01:39:29,370 --> 01:39:32,610
horrible education. You
know, I went to a bad, bad,

1669
01:39:32,611 --> 01:39:37,530
bad public school that had an influx
of hippies from UMass that came in and

1670
01:39:37,531 --> 01:39:42,030
experiment that on us. So we
had no education whatsoever.

1671
01:39:42,031 --> 01:39:45,530
I graduated from high school
on a plea bargain. Uh,

1672
01:39:45,540 --> 01:39:47,790
I had very good, um,

1673
01:39:48,210 --> 01:39:50,970
S a T so I had scholarships
to wherever I wanted to go,

1674
01:39:50,971 --> 01:39:53,850
but I chose not to because
I misunderstood Bob Dylan.

1675
01:39:53,851 --> 01:39:54,900
I didn't know he was lying.

1676
01:39:55,020 --> 01:39:58,710
So I went and hopped trains and
hitchhiked around and lived homeless for a

1677
01:39:58,710 --> 01:40:03,330
couple of years and I never read
Bowlby Dick till I was 45. Thank you.

1678
01:40:03,840 --> 01:40:07,200
If I'd read Moby Dick when I was
supposed to would call the JJ,

1679
01:40:07,230 --> 01:40:08,550
I wouldn't have gotten it.

1680
01:40:09,090 --> 01:40:13,170
But I was able to get it at the right
age and now it's my favorite book cause I

1681
01:40:13,171 --> 01:40:14,340
was ready for it. You know,

1682
01:40:14,970 --> 01:40:19,200
there's so many things that are on the
curriculum that are very, very important.

1683
01:40:19,980 --> 01:40:21,210
Maybe not that day.

1684
01:40:21,390 --> 01:40:26,190
I think there's also an issue with people
not thinking of education in terms of

1685
01:40:26,340 --> 01:40:28,410
like that it's a lifetime for sure.

1686
01:40:28,660 --> 01:40:32,010
It's not something that you graduated
from college and then you're done.

1687
01:40:32,280 --> 01:40:35,670
We really should be educating ourselves
throughout life shorts and not just

1688
01:40:35,880 --> 01:40:38,430
accidentally or
incidentally by experiences.

1689
01:40:38,730 --> 01:40:43,500
We should do it because there's things
that we pursue that are interesting now

1690
01:40:43,501 --> 01:40:46,920
is one of the greatest times ever to do
that because of audio books that you can

1691
01:40:46,921 --> 01:40:49,470
do it while you're in the car. You
could do it while you're on the train,

1692
01:40:49,620 --> 01:40:54,220
you can get educated and you can also,
they're doing this weird connecting

1693
01:40:54,220 --> 01:40:56,740
thing where I've not
experimented with this,

1694
01:40:56,741 --> 01:41:01,741
but I'd love to where people take courses
online and then find people who are

1695
01:41:01,871 --> 01:41:06,550
also taking courses online in their
communities and then immediate like a

1696
01:41:06,551 --> 01:41:11,410
fucking Starbucks to discuss what
happened before, uh, in the class,

1697
01:41:11,411 --> 01:41:15,340
which is mind blowing that that can
happen. So you can take, you know, uh,

1698
01:41:15,580 --> 01:41:18,250
one of my huge, I mean,

1699
01:41:18,251 --> 01:41:21,750
one of the things I wanted to do is I
wanted to learn to play jazz and let it

1700
01:41:21,760 --> 01:41:22,780
play upright bass.

1701
01:41:22,781 --> 01:41:27,781
I took that up at 45 and I learned to
play upright bebop bass passably a huge

1702
01:41:28,991 --> 01:41:32,350
accomplishment. And now I really
want to learn a language, you know,

1703
01:41:32,351 --> 01:41:33,520
so I was looking at a little bit,

1704
01:41:33,521 --> 01:41:38,521
cause I figured maybe there's a
government watch list I'm not on,

1705
01:41:39,220 --> 01:41:40,690
so I should learn Arabic.

1706
01:41:40,840 --> 01:41:43,990
No, that was my thing. Cause
don't you think that that,

1707
01:41:43,991 --> 01:41:47,440
that ticks all the boxes that's
going to give me everything. Yeah.

1708
01:41:47,550 --> 01:41:49,690
If I just learned Arabic.
So I started looking

1709
01:41:49,920 --> 01:41:54,920
to how I can learn how I
can learn Arabic and uh,

1710
01:41:55,500 --> 01:42:00,500
it's amazing the kind of network that's
developing all over the world to be able

1711
01:42:02,041 --> 01:42:06,830
to learn anything. So my argument
with you, uh, on, uh, on the, uh,

1712
01:42:06,831 --> 01:42:10,740
on the Bernie thing of paying for
everybody's college is I think we can get

1713
01:42:10,741 --> 01:42:15,690
college so fucking cheap. You can
go to college your whole life. Well,

1714
01:42:15,820 --> 01:42:18,000
I don't think that's a bad idea, you know,

1715
01:42:18,001 --> 01:42:19,600
if it's possible to get called that cheap.

1716
01:42:19,601 --> 01:42:21,730
But I don't want professors
to be poor. I mean,

1717
01:42:21,731 --> 01:42:25,240
I think one of the real problems we have
with public education is that people

1718
01:42:25,241 --> 01:42:28,900
don't want to be a teacher because Patriot
teachers don't get paid much. Sure.

1719
01:42:28,901 --> 01:42:30,490
But there's, there's a way, there's,

1720
01:42:31,060 --> 01:42:34,060
I would say that's government
intervention that's doing that.

1721
01:42:34,390 --> 01:42:37,120
I would say if you, government
intervention is keeping the salary.

1722
01:42:37,450 --> 01:42:38,470
I think so. Really?

1723
01:42:38,500 --> 01:42:43,120
I really think so because I think that
we're not having enough of the, of the,

1724
01:42:43,121 --> 01:42:47,770
of the, of the competition is
stuff there. I mean, um, you know,

1725
01:42:47,850 --> 01:42:52,220
you, you would pay good money to be in
a room with the Steven Pinker, you know,

1726
01:42:52,450 --> 01:42:56,140
and I think that locally, this was always
a problem that I'd never figured out.

1727
01:42:56,141 --> 01:43:00,760
You know, when I was in Greenfield,
Massachusetts, a town of 20,000,

1728
01:43:01,180 --> 01:43:05,560
I would say to all the other, uh, by
other high school students, I would say,

1729
01:43:05,561 --> 01:43:06,394
you know,

1730
01:43:06,460 --> 01:43:11,460
if we didn't give our money to the rolling
stones and the Beatles and Dylan and

1731
01:43:12,551 --> 01:43:13,720
all these other bands,

1732
01:43:13,930 --> 01:43:17,560
we could pull our buddy together
and have a really good local band.

1733
01:43:18,070 --> 01:43:21,610
We could have a great band
right here in town, you know?

1734
01:43:21,850 --> 01:43:25,390
And I think that if you
thought of education that way,

1735
01:43:25,600 --> 01:43:30,160
can't we get in our little area really
great teachers, you can teach this stuff.

1736
01:43:30,161 --> 01:43:32,210
It might be pretty
[inaudible]. Well, it'd be okay

1737
01:43:32,700 --> 01:43:36,280
using if we could spread education
right through any, any method,

1738
01:43:36,310 --> 01:43:38,950
whatever we can do, if we can
encourage people to be more educated.

1739
01:43:39,280 --> 01:43:42,910
But I think that one of the best
ways to do it really is just, look,

1740
01:43:42,911 --> 01:43:45,400
there's a lot of podcasts
that are educating people.

1741
01:43:45,670 --> 01:43:48,430
There's a lot of information
that you can get and it's minor,

1742
01:43:49,900 --> 01:43:52,010
but it's what getting is, where

1743
01:43:52,010 --> 01:43:54,740
there's more information
available now than ever before.

1744
01:43:54,741 --> 01:43:57,770
I think it's very different than
what colleges traditionally colleges.

1745
01:43:57,800 --> 01:44:00,800
A thing where you go and it's
a Rite of passage. It's like,

1746
01:44:00,830 --> 01:44:04,850
and we don't have those in this world,
and I think we could do with them.

1747
01:44:05,060 --> 01:44:08,840
I think we could do with these rights,
particularly for young men. I don't mind,

1748
01:44:08,950 --> 01:44:11,240
and maybe it's the case for young
women, obviously I never was one,

1749
01:44:11,241 --> 01:44:13,460
but when you're a young man,

1750
01:44:13,500 --> 01:44:17,510
there's this transitionary period where
you're a boy and then all of a sudden,

1751
01:44:17,540 --> 01:44:22,070
am I a man yet? Like when am I a man?
Certainly a lot of, a lot of cultures,

1752
01:44:22,071 --> 01:44:23,930
religions have done that.

1753
01:44:24,140 --> 01:44:27,500
Getting thrown into getting that
certificate and getting your diploma.

1754
01:44:27,501 --> 01:44:31,700
Holy shit, I graduated from
fucking university. I'm a man now.

1755
01:44:32,070 --> 01:44:36,440
I'm a grown up. I have a degree.
I'm a woman now. I have a degree.

1756
01:44:36,560 --> 01:44:41,090
I am an adult. And you're obviously,
you know, uh, I'm, I'm seeing this,

1757
01:44:41,540 --> 01:44:45,470
you know, it's okay to speak
with an accent. It's not
okay to hear with one. Uh,

1758
01:44:46,100 --> 01:44:51,100
I'm hearing that from someone who spent
an awful lot of time explaining to

1759
01:44:51,801 --> 01:44:54,560
myself and others why I didn't
go to college. You know,

1760
01:44:54,561 --> 01:44:58,610
you wanted to show you weren't
a loser. I didn't have that.

1761
01:44:59,000 --> 01:45:02,220
I didn't say I went to Ringling brothers
Barnum Bailey greatest show on earth

1762
01:45:02,240 --> 01:45:05,750
clown college. You know what I
mean? If you want a big shore,

1763
01:45:05,930 --> 01:45:09,920
you don't get respect. That's where
you go. Well, I'd say I talk about it.

1764
01:45:09,921 --> 01:45:12,740
It's just cause I want people to
really know where my head was at.

1765
01:45:12,741 --> 01:45:16,070
I don't want to like glorify
was when I was in college,

1766
01:45:16,190 --> 01:45:19,850
I went without any right of
passage at all. Right. You know,

1767
01:45:20,030 --> 01:45:23,870
and the closest I had to a right of
passage was earning my living. Well,

1768
01:45:23,871 --> 01:45:27,410
the trust. Huge. You were also,
you were on a different pursuit.

1769
01:45:27,440 --> 01:45:30,860
Like your pursuit was the Carney
pursuit and you enjoyed that.

1770
01:45:30,861 --> 01:45:34,420
I mean there was like a, you have
how to lust for it, you know,

1771
01:45:34,490 --> 01:45:39,140
and it obviously worked
out well. Did okay,

1772
01:45:39,200 --> 01:45:42,390
listen, you really have to bale it too
because it has to occur around now. Yeah.

1773
01:45:42,410 --> 01:45:46,430
Okay. Alright. What are you doing?
You just hanging out. I'm no,

1774
01:45:46,431 --> 01:45:50,690
I'm going to go. Why do you watch this
show up? Perpetual grace limited. No,

1775
01:45:50,691 --> 01:45:55,490
never heard of it. Okay. What is it?
Um, uh, uh, did you watch show Patriots?

1776
01:45:55,850 --> 01:46:00,530
Nope. Okay. Um, best shows I have seen.

1777
01:46:00,560 --> 01:46:05,180
Are they fiction television? Yes. Okay.
Yes. Not the Patriot. Not Mel Gibson.

1778
01:46:05,420 --> 01:46:10,190
Put a show called, what's
it on? A Patriot is on, uh,

1779
01:46:10,340 --> 01:46:14,720
Amazon prime member. They used to be
like 20 shows and you knew all of them.

1780
01:46:14,750 --> 01:46:19,460
Now there's millions. It's
impossible. Uh, so I am going to uh,

1781
01:46:19,490 --> 01:46:23,810
meet and talk to the guy who created
all, all of those things. Oh,

1782
01:46:24,980 --> 01:46:28,330
there it is. That show grace. Yeah.
Perpetual grace. They're in Israel. Oh,

1783
01:46:28,340 --> 01:46:32,600
okay. And I know that dude, what's
that dude's name? It's Ben King's lads.

1784
01:46:32,601 --> 01:46:32,901
Right.

1785
01:46:32,901 --> 01:46:37,530
And then that's Jimmy Simpson and that
guy to the left is Jimmy Simpson there

1786
01:46:37,830 --> 01:46:40,970
guys. Great. I never knew who that guy
is. He's just always awesome. Yeah.

1787
01:46:41,000 --> 01:46:44,510
What was he in recently? He was in
something really good. That's right.

1788
01:46:44,511 --> 01:46:49,220
Westworld. Steve Conrad is
the guy who writes, directs,

1789
01:46:49,260 --> 01:46:53,940
produces, creates these
shows. And uh, I uh,

1790
01:46:53,941 --> 01:46:57,450
he happens to be in town and I'm
going to talk to him for my podcast,

1791
01:46:57,540 --> 01:46:58,800
which is Penn Sunday school.

1792
01:46:59,290 --> 01:47:02,910
I'm going to go to another studio and
talk to him and I'd already set up the

1793
01:47:02,911 --> 01:47:04,770
time. So nice at the camp B,

1794
01:47:04,780 --> 01:47:08,130
a change that Amazon's doing
all these different shows.

1795
01:47:08,131 --> 01:47:11,320
They're getting into the standup comedy
world now too. Yeah. It's crazy. Yeah.

1796
01:47:11,390 --> 01:47:14,430
Huge. Huge amounts of beautiful.
There's so many places with this.

1797
01:47:14,610 --> 01:47:19,380
So much stuff. But there's so many
places to put that stuff. Yes. Beautiful.

1798
01:47:19,710 --> 01:47:22,560
And wow, what a great time.
We got to do this more often.

1799
01:47:22,561 --> 01:47:24,750
We got to do this more often. This
is the first time we've done it.

1800
01:47:24,950 --> 01:47:27,450
How is that possible? This podcast
is almost 10 years old. Yeah.

1801
01:47:27,520 --> 01:47:30,570
Is the first time you've been crazy
and also cause people yell at me.

1802
01:47:30,780 --> 01:47:33,540
That's a Twitter thing. Go
talk to Joe Rogan. You asshole.

1803
01:47:33,541 --> 01:47:35,820
This is how fast time's going.
When I did your radio show,

1804
01:47:35,821 --> 01:47:38,100
I didn't have a podcast that
was more than 10 years ago.

1805
01:47:38,540 --> 01:47:42,720
That fucking crazy and crazy flying.
Let's promise to do this once a year.

1806
01:47:42,721 --> 01:47:45,780
Can we do that? At least let's do it.
Okay. Thank you, sir. Thanks a lot, man.

1807
01:47:45,840 --> 01:47:47,550
Thank you. Bye everybody.

1808
01:47:57,140 --> 01:47:57,973
