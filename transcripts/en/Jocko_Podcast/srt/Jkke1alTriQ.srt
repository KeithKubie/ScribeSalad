1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:03,480
Jocko. I want to hear your
thoughts on over detachment.

2
00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:08,670
I'm a police officer and I'm sure military
personnel experience the same over

3
00:00:08,671 --> 00:00:13,671
detachment defined as emotional separation
from moments which required emotional

4
00:00:13,711 --> 00:00:16,170
response in family and profession.

5
00:00:17,130 --> 00:00:20,040
So what are you thoughts on over
detachment? Yeah, this is definitely,

6
00:00:20,130 --> 00:00:25,050
obviously I'm always encouraging people
to be able to detach because that's how

7
00:00:25,051 --> 00:00:27,000
you get your emotions
out of the situation.

8
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:31,470
But this happens to what my brother
right here is talking about this police

9
00:00:31,471 --> 00:00:34,860
officer's saying, hey, sometimes you
know, we think about being over detached

10
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:39,030
and is something you need to watch out
for because you don't want to go through

11
00:00:39,031 --> 00:00:42,450
your life where you have no more emotions.
Cause then you're not living a life,

12
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:46,790
then you're a robot or a machine and,
and you don't,

13
00:00:46,791 --> 00:00:51,750
you need to have emotions.
So what as I thought about this,

14
00:00:52,710 --> 00:00:56,940
I thought,
how did I watch out for that?

15
00:00:56,940 --> 00:00:59,660
And it's something that creeps in on
anybody that does anything we could add.

16
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:03,570
You don't even have to be a copper or
a military person. I mean you could do,

17
00:01:03,571 --> 00:01:07,010
if you're any job that you
have where you have free,

18
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:10,920
can't just get all emotional about
stuff. Um, if you're in finance,

19
00:01:10,921 --> 00:01:14,220
if you're anything you could just
become detached. So how do you do,

20
00:01:14,270 --> 00:01:15,180
what do you look out for?

21
00:01:15,950 --> 00:01:20,950
One thing that I did and still do
is compartmentalize and draw little

22
00:01:23,671 --> 00:01:27,090
segregation between work and home.
Mm.

23
00:01:28,190 --> 00:01:31,050
Um,
and there's a really easy way to do that,

24
00:01:31,051 --> 00:01:34,110
especially for people that are cops
or it doesn't matter what you do,

25
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:40,470
whatever that uniform is that you
wear at work, whether you're a cop,

26
00:01:40,471 --> 00:01:42,960
whether you're military, whether
you were in a business suit at work,

27
00:01:43,410 --> 00:01:47,430
when you get home, take off
that uniform, take it off.

28
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:51,150
Matter of fact, if you can take it
off before you get home, you know,

29
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:54,900
leave it at the office. Yeah.
Cause you want to leave that there.

30
00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:59,820
And when you get home,
put on the home clothes,

31
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:03,750
right? The t shirt, comfortable
t shirt, the flip flops,

32
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:08,340
the the shorts B,
be relaxed at home,

33
00:02:08,890 --> 00:02:13,320
but be physically in a
different uniform at home.

34
00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:17,340
Not even a uniform in a different
change your change your appearance and

35
00:02:17,341 --> 00:02:21,360
therefore change your state of mind
a little bit different music, right?

36
00:02:21,361 --> 00:02:22,920
Whatever it is that you're
listened to at work,

37
00:02:23,850 --> 00:02:27,870
go to something different at home, Eh,
you know when you're going into work,

38
00:02:27,871 --> 00:02:31,170
listen to the first hour of Jocko
podcast when you're coming home.

39
00:02:31,171 --> 00:02:34,700
He listened to the second hour,
right? That's how we do it. Yo,

40
00:02:34,710 --> 00:02:38,430
you want to have a different
attitude, a different language, right?

41
00:02:38,431 --> 00:02:41,760
Don't come a home thrown around
the in acronyms from work. Yeah,

42
00:02:41,790 --> 00:02:44,910
and you know I've talked about
this before. I never swore at home.

43
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,740
I swore like hell at work,

44
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:50,310
but I never swore home so I was using a
different language than I was completely

45
00:02:50,311 --> 00:02:53,970
compartmentalizing what I was doing
at work and what I was doing at home.

46
00:02:54,540 --> 00:02:58,560
And then checkout your posture. What
are you standing around your house like?

47
00:02:58,561 --> 00:03:02,320
Are you standing all cross
armed and glaring at people?

48
00:03:04,550 --> 00:03:06,020
Let's just ask the question.

49
00:03:06,021 --> 00:03:08,630
Are you in a modified weaver stance
when you're talking to your wife getting

50
00:03:08,631 --> 00:03:13,610
ready to do a quick drunk?
It's like a pistol shooting
stance. Like that's, no, no.

51
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:17,870
You know, are you, are you
digging for under hooks?

52
00:03:17,871 --> 00:03:19,640
If your kids trying to give you a hug,
you know what I mean?

53
00:03:19,641 --> 00:03:23,600
Are you looking to get the take
down? No. You want to relax. Right.

54
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:26,660
And another thing is
find some, uh, you know,

55
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:30,650
what's maybe maybe a group of people
that aren't involved in your work.

56
00:03:30,660 --> 00:03:33,590
That can be hard. I mean,
and, and luckily for me,

57
00:03:33,591 --> 00:03:37,880
my wife made friends that were
outside of the seal community.

58
00:03:38,780 --> 00:03:42,980
And so I got a bunch of buddies that were,
had nothing to do with the seal teams.

59
00:03:43,170 --> 00:03:45,380
They have their friends, they
were friends with my wife. Yeah.

60
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:47,600
Friends and husbands of my wife's friends.

61
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:50,900
So I had a whole group of people that
are still hanging out with all the time.

62
00:03:51,170 --> 00:03:54,740
They have nothing to do with
the military at all. In fact,

63
00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:58,490
many of them are as bad as far as you
could get from military personnel is one

64
00:03:58,491 --> 00:04:00,920
could imagine. Yeah. And,

65
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:04,940
but that's another thing that helped
me segregate the two. Now, of course,

66
00:04:04,941 --> 00:04:07,100
I'm not saying you've got
to let your guard down 100%,

67
00:04:07,101 --> 00:04:08,000
cause you shouldn't do that,

68
00:04:08,450 --> 00:04:13,450
but you should let it down
enough that you can enjoy life.

69
00:04:14,690 --> 00:04:17,300
Um,
and

70
00:04:20,430 --> 00:04:24,640
you got it attach sometimes. Now
that being said, cause it's kind of,

71
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:26,220
it is going to help you
make good decisions.

72
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:30,240
But there are also times
where it's not good.

73
00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:32,550
And if you're detached and your
wife's trying to talk to you,

74
00:04:32,551 --> 00:04:37,110
it's not going to be good. Yup. So
open up, you gotta show some emotions.

75
00:04:37,290 --> 00:04:41,760
And one of the things about being
detached, here's a, here's a paradox.

76
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:46,920
You gotta be detached enough so that
you recognize when you're not showing

77
00:04:46,921 --> 00:04:49,220
enough emotion. Yeah. You know
what I'm saying? If you're,

78
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:53,840
if you're so detached
that you being detached,

79
00:04:53,841 --> 00:04:57,000
it allow you to realize that, oh my God,
I'm not showing any emotions at all.

80
00:04:57,060 --> 00:04:58,860
I'm too detached.
Yeah.

81
00:04:59,370 --> 00:05:01,860
So don't try and be a tough
guy that's just being detached.

82
00:05:01,861 --> 00:05:04,350
Cause if you're detached enough, you'll
realize that you're being too detached.

83
00:05:04,351 --> 00:05:08,880
Yep. Yeah. And there is two d, well
obviously like if you're, you know,

84
00:05:08,881 --> 00:05:13,680
you're in a debate argument, fight
whatever with your girlfriend wife, right?

85
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:18,390
And you're detached, let's say, you know,
you're right. Let's say you are right.

86
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:22,580
That has nothing to do with anything
when you're arguing with you.

87
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:25,770
Generally speaking though,
in my experience, yeah,

88
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:29,310
I would agree with that in my experience.
But here's the thing though,

89
00:05:29,311 --> 00:05:32,240
because when you're looking at a certain
way, I just want to make that same.

90
00:05:32,241 --> 00:05:32,760
And again,

91
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:37,760
when you're in an argument with like
your wife or your close friend or any

92
00:05:38,681 --> 00:05:40,260
gifts, your boss, your subordinate,

93
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:45,390
whether you're right or not is almost,
doesn't matter at all.

94
00:05:46,470 --> 00:05:51,240
What matters is what you're trying to do,
what direction you're trying to move.

95
00:05:51,810 --> 00:05:53,930
And is winning the argument
being right or wrong,

96
00:05:53,950 --> 00:05:57,030
going to help you move in a direction to
move in? That's the real question. Yeah.

97
00:05:57,080 --> 00:06:00,920
So detach for a minute and figure
out the answer to that question. Yes.

98
00:06:00,950 --> 00:06:04,370
Cause I never care if I'm right or
wrong. That's not never my goal. Well,

99
00:06:04,430 --> 00:06:07,860
in an argument with something,
did I say never. Okay.

100
00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:12,970
I usually don't care the most for
the most park. Yeah. Yeah. And,

101
00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:14,520
and I think a lot of times,

102
00:06:16,410 --> 00:06:20,310
a lot of times people do care whether
right or wrong. Oh my God, they do.

103
00:06:20,311 --> 00:06:25,050
They care. We'll go psycho or being right
or wrong. Yeah. One approved beyond,

104
00:06:25,051 --> 00:06:28,680
you know, like a reasonable
doubt. All questions denied.

105
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:32,520
I'm 100% right. You're wrong. And
so even when people are wrong,

106
00:06:32,521 --> 00:06:36,150
they'll still want to just
win the argument. Right? So
that's, that's, that's bad.

107
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:39,360
What can be even worse
is when you are right,

108
00:06:40,290 --> 00:06:43,830
yet the other person is it,
let's say your wife is emotional cause,

109
00:06:43,910 --> 00:06:47,060
and this is a known thing that,
okay,

110
00:06:48,650 --> 00:06:51,140
the girls generally speaking,
they,

111
00:06:51,590 --> 00:06:56,090
they want to know that you care more so
than they want you to fix their problem.

112
00:06:56,360 --> 00:07:00,490
Like if someone has, if your
wife is having a problem at
work or something, right?

113
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:02,960
They just want you to care
that that's going on with them.

114
00:07:03,230 --> 00:07:07,100
They don't want like all this tricking
advice. You know, that generally speaking,

115
00:07:07,130 --> 00:07:08,690
I'm not going to category is there,
it's not black and white.

116
00:07:08,690 --> 00:07:12,940
But generally speaking, so
let's say you're in a debate
or something, I say deep,

117
00:07:13,010 --> 00:07:15,650
you're an argument. You're in a
fight and you know you're right in,

118
00:07:15,651 --> 00:07:18,560
let's say you are right. If you're
all detached and being like, well,

119
00:07:18,561 --> 00:07:23,030
here's the logic behind why I'm right and
you have this airtight case that's not

120
00:07:23,031 --> 00:07:26,690
going to help your relationship.
She wants to know first off that you care.

121
00:07:27,050 --> 00:07:31,370
She's mad. She said she's whatever. Do you
care about that? That's the way you win,

122
00:07:31,371 --> 00:07:34,130
not the argument. That's the way you
in this situation. Yes. You know,

123
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:36,230
and so not only are you,

124
00:07:37,340 --> 00:07:41,990
not only do you get out of the
fight intact as a relationship,

125
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:45,590
but you're the good guy. And really that's
part of the reason why she likes you,

126
00:07:45,620 --> 00:07:49,720
because you're the good guy. That's
a wind, wind roof. So yeah, that,

127
00:07:49,721 --> 00:07:52,140
that just sometimes question
why my wife likes me at all.

128
00:07:54,510 --> 00:07:58,560
Yeah, yeah. No, that's, that's a,
that's it. But yeah, so detached.

129
00:07:58,561 --> 00:08:03,340
So you see that but be
attached because you care. Yes.

130
00:08:03,610 --> 00:08:05,650
Yes.
And show that you care.

131
00:08:06,580 --> 00:08:11,380
And then when you go back
to work, your comp, Europe,

132
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:16,300
military person, you're a
businessperson. Put your uniform back on,

133
00:08:16,301 --> 00:08:17,440
put your boots back on,

134
00:08:17,441 --> 00:08:22,441
put your body on back on lock and
load and get back into detachment zone

135
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:28,030
and move forward. Now at the
question kind of implies this too,

136
00:08:28,090 --> 00:08:31,720
and I will point this out.
I mean at work,

137
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:34,540
you also can't just be detached all the
time, cause you're, you're a leader,

138
00:08:34,570 --> 00:08:35,550
you're in a leadership position.

139
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:37,710
So you can't just walk around
just detached from every, no.

140
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:40,780
You got to show emotions. You got to
relate to the people you're working with.

141
