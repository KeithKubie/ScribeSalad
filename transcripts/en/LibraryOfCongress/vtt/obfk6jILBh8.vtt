00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:03.970
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, D.C.

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:24.030
&gt;&gt; Ellen Terrell: Thank
you for coming today.

00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:26.990
The third time seemed
to have been a charm.

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:29.950
The two times between
the Pope and the snow,

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:31.860
we didn't, we didn't have success.

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:35.250
My name is Ellen Terrell, and I'm
a Business Reference Specialist

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:37.850
in the Science and Technology
and Business section.

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:39.970
And we're sponsoring
this program today.

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:43.000
It is my pleasure to
introduce the speaker,

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:44.600
today's speaker, Jim Johnston.

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:46.500
He grew up in Independence,
Missouri,

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.260
which is Harry Truman's hometown.

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.810
And he has a degree in mathematics
from university of Kansas,

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:56.290
and a law degree from
University of Michigan.

00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:59.550
He practices law in D.C., where
he focuses on telecommunications

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:02.000 position:56%
and intellectual property law areas.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.330
He began writing for
publications about 25 years ago,

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:10.090
and has been published in the New
York Times, The Washington Post,

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:11.970 position:56%
The White House Historical Magazine,

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:15.780
The American Historical
Magazine, and The American Lawyer.

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:21.270
He has won two journalism awards
and has two books to his credit:

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:25.990
The Recollections of Margaret
Cabell Brown Loughborough,

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:29.190 position:56%
and the book today that he's
speaking on which is From Slave Ship

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:33.240
to Harvard, which is about Yarrow
Mamout and his descendants.

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:38.130
The book is for sale outside in
the tables, if you're interested.

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:43.620
So, but when I asked him why
he decided to write this book,

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:48.940 position:56%
he said he had seen James Alexander
Simpsons' portrait of Yarrow that is

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:53.630
in the Georgetown Library, and
that the Peale portrait used

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:58.570
on the cover, he just wondered
who this man was to have been --

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:02.950
get two portraits at the time.

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:07.020
So I just wanted to
welcome him and you here.

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:11.720
Just to let you know, the program
is being webcast for inclusion

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:13.020
on the Library's website.

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:16.070 position:56%
So when you ask questions, just know
you'll -- the back of your head,

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:17.510
at the very least,
will be on the camera.

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:19.030
So if you have an issue with that.

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:21.510
So I just want to welcome him.

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:26.670
[ Applause ]

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:27.970
&gt;&gt; James H. Johnston:
Thank you, Ellen.

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:31.000
You know, we had the Pope
knock this out last fall,

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:32.770
and the snowstorm in January.

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:36.840
So I'm glad that we have a chance
to talk at the Library of Congress,

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:41.130
and I thank you all for coming.

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:43.960
Ellen sort of stole my
thunder because what I'm going

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:46.770
to do today is talk, first
of all, why I wrote the book,

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:49.150
because I think people
want to know that.

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:51.560
And secondly, I'm going
to go through the book.

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:55.520
And the book -- I intended the
book as a story of race in America.

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:58.000
It's more than just
this man or this family.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:02.010
And as we go through it, you'll see
it's a story of race in America.

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:03.410
But it started here,

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:06.790
at the Georgetown Library,
which you all may know.

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:10.940
And I was in what was then the
Peabody Room before the fire.

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:14.220
And I was -- this actually was
a photograph taken at the time.

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:17.070
The day I was there and
discovered the portrait.

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:19.820
And you look across that room,

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:24.030
and you see on the wall this
portrait of a black man.

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:27.490
And that's up close of it.

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:31.400
And at the bottom right, the
label said, "Yarrow Mamout,

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:35.450
James Alexander Simpson, 1823."

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:37.970
And, you know, I thought you
don't think of Georgetown

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:40.460
as a place for African Americans.

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:41.760
That sort of intrigued me.

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:44.500
Plus just the portrait
itself intrigued me.

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:49.120
So I went home, as we all do
now, and Googled Yarrow Mamout,

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:52.360
and saw this portrait by the
great Charles Wilson Peale.

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:58.680
And this is obviously a much
more artistic portrait of Yarrow.

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:00.410 position:56%
And a friend of mine is the Director

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:02.560
of the Smithsonian
Museum of American Art.

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:04.250
And I said, "Do you
know this portrait?"

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:08.150
She said, "No, but any portrait
of an African American prior

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:11.640
to the Civil War is rare, and
you have two of the same man,

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:14.170
so you might do something about it.

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:16.940
And it took me eight
years to do something

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:18.520
about it and write this book.

00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:20.970
That's the story I'm
going to tell you now.

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:24.370
You have to start.

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:27.610
It's race in America, so
you have to start in 1634,

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:30.950
and that's when the Ark and
Dove brought the first Europeans

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:32.250
to Maryland.

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:34.740
And this is the --
these two ships coming.

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:39.050
And Lord Baltimore was the
proponent of the Maryland Colony.

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:43.130
And he said the colonists, there
were 150 on these two ships,

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:47.930 position:56%
so when you get to America, you have
to remember there's nothing there.

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:51.780
Everything you need has
to come from England.

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:57.520
Utensils, saws, nails, hammers,
metal, fabric, sugar, wine.

00:04:57.520 --> 00:04:59.530
Anything you want that's
manufactured

00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:02.650
or can't be raised
there, you have to import.

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:05.950
And therefore, you need
something to pay for that.

00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:07.590
You have to do something in America

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:10.080
that you can pay for
all these imports.

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:11.740
And there's a lot of riches there.

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:14.550
There are fur, you can raise crops,

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:16.900
you can do logs, you
can do pitch, tar.

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:19.900
You can do all sorts of things.

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:23.060
One thing you shouldn't do though.

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:26.820
The one thing you shouldn't do is
what the Virginians have decided

00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:30.600 position:56%
to do, and that is to raise tobacco.

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:33.990
Because the Virginians at the
Jamestown colony had discovered

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:37.670
that a man could work for a year,
and he could make six times more

00:05:37.670 --> 00:05:40.770
with tobacco than anything
else he did.

00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:44.740
And so this tobacco
mania took over Virginia.

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:49.230
And the Marylanders quickly
learned that yes, indeed,

00:05:49.230 --> 00:05:50.930
tobacco was the best thing.

00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:54.020
And that is why they
developed this system

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:57.450
of agricultural factories
called plantations

00:05:57.450 --> 00:06:00.530
where they needed cheap,
unskilled labor to work.

00:06:00.530 --> 00:06:04.840
They first got it from
convicts and indentured servants

00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:08.540
from the Great Britain, and
eventually slaves from Africa.

00:06:08.540 --> 00:06:14.780
And that's how slavery got started:
all because of this one plant.

00:06:14.780 --> 00:06:19.490
To get tobacco to England -- that's
the trick, to get it to England.

00:06:19.490 --> 00:06:22.890
So when you grow it, they would
pack it into these what were called

00:06:22.890 --> 00:06:26.010
"hog's heads" and this
was one technique shown

00:06:26.010 --> 00:06:28.120 position:56%
on this is they'd just roll it down.

00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:32.580
But if you roll it more than
ten miles, it ruins the tobacco.

00:06:32.580 --> 00:06:36.480
As a result of that, all the
settlements, all the plantations

00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:40.870 position:56%
in Maryland and Virginia were within
ten miles of some body of water

00:06:40.870 --> 00:06:44.790
where they could roll these hogs
heads down, load them on a skiff,

00:06:44.790 --> 00:06:46.370
and then float them to a port

00:06:46.370 --> 00:06:48.970
where they could be
transported to England.

00:06:50.530 --> 00:06:51.990
&gt;&gt; The net effect of that.

00:06:51.990 --> 00:06:56.360
I'm not sure if this is the
Library of Congress map of 1795.

00:06:56.360 --> 00:06:58.310
I think it may be in the
Maryland State Archives.

00:06:58.310 --> 00:07:01.100
But you can look at
this map of Maryland,

00:07:01.100 --> 00:07:03.550
and you see the bodies of water.

00:07:03.550 --> 00:07:06.930
And I've marked on there
with those little logos,

00:07:06.930 --> 00:07:09.110
little labels, the ports.

00:07:09.110 --> 00:07:10.550
And these were the deep-water ports

00:07:10.550 --> 00:07:13.800
where a sailing ship
could come into a harbor.

00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:15.730
And that's -- those
were the tobacco ports.

00:07:15.730 --> 00:07:18.870
So you had to bring the
tobacco down to those ports

00:07:18.870 --> 00:07:21.860
where it would be reloaded
onto an ocean-going ship.

00:07:21.860 --> 00:07:25.100
But the net effect of all of
that was that in the Maryland

00:07:25.100 --> 00:07:32.110 position:56%
and Virginia colonies, all the
people, the economies were all based

00:07:32.110 --> 00:07:34.310 position:56%
within ten miles of a body of water.

00:07:34.310 --> 00:07:39.390
So that's what happened
throughout this area.

00:07:40.620 --> 00:07:45.100
Here on the Potomac, they kept
moving this plantations farther

00:07:45.100 --> 00:07:49.020
and farther west, north
and west, up the Potomac.

00:07:49.020 --> 00:07:51.530
Until they came to a spot right
here where you're looking at.

00:07:51.530 --> 00:07:53.060
I took this photograph.

00:07:53.060 --> 00:07:58.040
There's a 40-foot deep hole in the
Potomac River, and it's deep enough

00:07:58.040 --> 00:08:01.340
for a sailing ship to anchor
there and not roll over.

00:08:01.340 --> 00:08:05.950
And that became the last tobacco
port on the Potomac River.

00:08:05.950 --> 00:08:09.310
Here's another picture of it.

00:08:09.310 --> 00:08:12.720
It's the Kennedy Center,
and the port is Georgetown,

00:08:12.720 --> 00:08:15.480
and that creek was Rock Creek.

00:08:15.480 --> 00:08:21.360
And Georgetown was the last port
on the Potomac River for tobacco.

00:08:21.360 --> 00:08:24.070
And I say that in terms
of the history and race --

00:08:24.070 --> 00:08:30.350
of race because the reason they put
the capital here was it was just

00:08:30.350 --> 00:08:32.120
east of Georgetown.

00:08:32.120 --> 00:08:36.150 position:56%
So that the fact that we're all in
Washington, D.C., we owe to tobacco.

00:08:36.150 --> 00:08:39.040
And the fact that we have
African Americans in great numbers

00:08:39.040 --> 00:08:42.800
in the United States is
all because of tobacco.

00:08:42.800 --> 00:08:45.730
Now with that, let me start
turning to Yarrow's story.

00:08:45.730 --> 00:08:49.890
So you sort of have the background
for why we had slavery in America,

00:08:49.890 --> 00:08:54.410
and why we're here in
Washington, D.C. talking about it.

00:08:54.410 --> 00:08:59.560
There's a man here called
Christopher Lowndes, L-o-w-n-d-e-s.

00:08:59.560 --> 00:09:04.060
And he and his three brothers
and his son were involved

00:09:04.060 --> 00:09:06.390
in this transatlantic slave trade.

00:09:06.390 --> 00:09:08.450
And that's the big
kind of slave trade.

00:09:08.450 --> 00:09:11.930
In fact, they were the
second largest slave traders,

00:09:11.930 --> 00:09:16.290
transatlantic slave traders in
what is now the United States.

00:09:16.290 --> 00:09:17.590
And this is his house.

00:09:17.590 --> 00:09:20.390
It's over here, just about three
miles from us in Bladensburg.

00:09:20.390 --> 00:09:22.620
It's called Bostwick, and
that's where he lived.

00:09:22.620 --> 00:09:23.920
This house is still there.

00:09:23.920 --> 00:09:27.400
It was built with money
from the slave trade.

00:09:28.510 --> 00:09:31.340 position:56%
Christopher Lowndes, there's a
thing called the Transatlantic Slave

00:09:31.340 --> 00:09:32.640
Trade Database.

00:09:32.640 --> 00:09:36.730
It's a very, very rich
resource where they went

00:09:36.730 --> 00:09:39.440
and got all the ships they
could conceive of that were

00:09:39.440 --> 00:09:42.960
in the slave trade and
compiled them with the owners,

00:09:42.960 --> 00:09:45.180
the ship names, and et cetera.

00:09:45.180 --> 00:09:47.690
I went through that
and got this slide.

00:09:47.690 --> 00:09:53.060
These are the ships the Lowndes'
owned or participated in.

00:09:53.060 --> 00:09:55.310
Christopher Lowndes, and he
had a brother in Liverpool,

00:09:55.310 --> 00:09:57.370
which was the English
center of the slave trade.

00:09:57.370 --> 00:09:59.530
And he had a brother on St. Kitts,

00:09:59.530 --> 00:10:03.490
which was a switching
point on the slave trade.

00:10:03.490 --> 00:10:08.250
And they had 9600 slaves
brought to the New World.

00:10:08.250 --> 00:10:11.240
Second largest slave traders in
America right here in Washington,

00:10:11.240 --> 00:10:18.220
D.C. His son, Francis, actually
captained these three ships --

00:10:18.220 --> 00:10:24.560
and you know, that's -- if you talk
about evil or lack of morality.

00:10:24.560 --> 00:10:27.070
Actually captaining a slave ship.

00:10:27.070 --> 00:10:30.580
Sailing it over to Africa,
picking the slaves up

00:10:30.580 --> 00:10:33.920
and bringing them here is sort of
is the pretty high up in the scale

00:10:33.920 --> 00:10:35.420
of immorality in my view.

00:10:35.420 --> 00:10:39.740
So his son Francis actually
captained these three ships.

00:10:39.740 --> 00:10:41.900
Now again, the reason
that I tell you this is

00:10:41.900 --> 00:10:43.340
because you're a Washington crowd.

00:10:43.340 --> 00:10:46.410
If you go over to Georgetown
and look at Tudor Place,

00:10:46.410 --> 00:10:48.460
that house was built
by Francis Lowndes.

00:10:48.460 --> 00:10:50.630
The two wings on this
house, the center section,

00:10:50.630 --> 00:10:52.490
was built by a later owner.

00:10:52.490 --> 00:10:56.030
So that the fancy Tudor Place
in Georgetown that we all think

00:10:56.030 --> 00:11:00.180
of as Georgetown is such a
[inaudible] place was a lot

00:11:00.180 --> 00:11:03.000
of it was built with
the slave trade money.

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:09.000
In fact, this man, Benjamin
Stoddert, married Francis --

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:13.190
Christopher Lowndes' daughter,
Francis Lowndes' sister.

00:11:13.190 --> 00:11:15.560
And the reason Benjamin
Stoddert, I mention him is

00:11:15.560 --> 00:11:20.120
because he was the first Secretary
of the Navy under John Adams.

00:11:20.120 --> 00:11:23.700
So the slave trade went very
high up in the government

00:11:23.700 --> 00:11:25.900
of the United States
with the first Secretary

00:11:25.900 --> 00:11:29.590
of the Navy being an
in-law of the slave traders

00:11:29.590 --> 00:11:32.030
that brought Yarrow Mamout over.

00:11:32.030 --> 00:11:35.740
The kind of ship they
used was this: a snau --

00:11:35.740 --> 00:11:38.850 position:56%
s-n-a-u, but it's pronounced "snow."

00:11:38.850 --> 00:11:42.270
Two-masted, shallow draft.

00:11:42.270 --> 00:11:44.450
That has a great advantage to them.

00:11:44.450 --> 00:11:46.790
I call these "the Federal
Express of the slave trade"

00:11:46.790 --> 00:11:50.370
because you could sail this
ship up a river of Africa,

00:11:50.370 --> 00:11:53.500
and people would flag
the ships down and say,

00:11:53.500 --> 00:11:55.100
"We've got slaves for sale."

00:11:55.100 --> 00:11:57.840
And the captain would stop, and
he'd buy maybe five slaves here

00:11:57.840 --> 00:11:59.330
or ten slaves there.

00:11:59.330 --> 00:12:02.960
And that was the -- this
was an ideal ship for that.

00:12:02.960 --> 00:12:04.800
And then when he came
across the Atlantic,

00:12:04.800 --> 00:12:06.100
of course if you were a slave,

00:12:06.100 --> 00:12:07.900
it wasn't very good,
and it rolled a lot.

00:12:07.900 --> 00:12:11.480
And you -- I'm going to talk about
what the conditions were like.

00:12:11.480 --> 00:12:13.680
But when he got to
America, he could go

00:12:13.680 --> 00:12:16.820
up those same rivers I showed
you, and the Chesapeake Bay,

00:12:16.820 --> 00:12:21.240
the Potomac River, and go up
to the plantations themselves.

00:12:21.240 --> 00:12:25.750
If we all here know Mt. Vernon,
and you've looked at Mt. Vernon,

00:12:25.750 --> 00:12:27.930 position:56%
you know what Mt. Vernon looks like.

00:12:27.930 --> 00:12:31.720 position:56%
These slave ships would sail right
up to the dock at Mt. Vernon and try

00:12:31.720 --> 00:12:35.470
to sell slaves to Washington
or his overseers.

00:12:35.470 --> 00:12:38.110
And then in the end, if
they didn't have enough --

00:12:38.110 --> 00:12:39.530
if they hadn't sold
their -- quote --

00:12:39.530 --> 00:12:44.680
"cargo," they would go to the big
cities like Annapolis or Baltimore

00:12:44.680 --> 00:12:46.510
and try to sell the
rest of the cargos.

00:12:46.510 --> 00:12:51.810
But the idea was not to transport
the slaves in wagons or on foot,

00:12:51.810 --> 00:12:55.580
but to transport them by
ship from Africa directly

00:12:55.580 --> 00:12:58.120
to the plantations in America.

00:12:58.120 --> 00:13:03.510
A slave ship captain described
the slave ships this way.

00:13:03.510 --> 00:13:04.810
Speaking of the slaves:

00:13:04.810 --> 00:13:07.070
"Their lodging rooms below
the deck are sometimes more

00:13:07.070 --> 00:13:09.390
than five feet high,
and sometimes less.

00:13:09.390 --> 00:13:12.550
And this height is divided towards
the middle, for the slaves lie

00:13:12.550 --> 00:13:15.940
in two rows, one above the
other, on each side of the ship.

00:13:15.940 --> 00:13:18.520
Close to each other
like books upon a shelf.

00:13:18.520 --> 00:13:21.410
I have known them so close that
the shelf would not easily contain

00:13:21.410 --> 00:13:22.710
one more.

00:13:22.710 --> 00:13:25.070
Cramped for want of room,
they are likewise in irons,

00:13:25.070 --> 00:13:28.010
for the most part, both hands
and feet, and two together,

00:13:28.010 --> 00:13:31.480
which makes it difficult for them
to turn or move to attempt either

00:13:31.480 --> 00:13:34.940
to rise or to lie down without
hurting themselves or each other."

00:13:34.940 --> 00:13:38.980
And my intent here is not to
make slavery look very good.

00:13:38.980 --> 00:13:40.910
I mean, this is just
terrible conditions.

00:13:40.910 --> 00:13:43.680
And this was written
by a slave ship captain

00:13:43.680 --> 00:13:45.780
at the time Yarrow came over.

00:13:45.780 --> 00:13:48.160
Roughly at the time, 1750.

00:13:48.160 --> 00:13:49.760
Yarrow came in 1752.

00:13:49.760 --> 00:13:52.530
So these are the conditions
on those ships.

00:13:52.530 --> 00:13:54.700
Now, I've said that this is
the story of race in America,

00:13:54.700 --> 00:13:58.410
and the reason I also like to
quote this man, this John Newton,

00:13:58.410 --> 00:14:01.560
he was a captain of a slave ship,
but after three voyages to America,

00:14:01.560 --> 00:14:03.530
he couldn't stand it anymore.

00:14:03.530 --> 00:14:06.230 position:56%
And he became a minister in England.

00:14:06.230 --> 00:14:07.980
And you may have heard
of John Newton

00:14:07.980 --> 00:14:10.400
because he wrote the
hymn Amazing Grace.

00:14:10.400 --> 00:14:12.980
And that's why that hymn is
associated with civil rights,

00:14:12.980 --> 00:14:16.490
because it was written by a man
who turned from being a captain

00:14:16.490 --> 00:14:22.220
of a slave ship to a advocate in
England to abolish the slave trade,

00:14:22.220 --> 00:14:25.220
and they did, under his pressure.

00:14:26.250 --> 00:14:27.900
Now, I'm going to get to Yarrow.

00:14:27.900 --> 00:14:29.970
He came -- he was a Fulani Muslim.

00:14:29.970 --> 00:14:34.570
And the Fulanis started in
Mali, that yellow country.

00:14:34.570 --> 00:14:39.450
And at the time he came, they were
moving militarily into West Africa,

00:14:39.450 --> 00:14:43.260
Senegal, and Guinea on
the West African Coast.

00:14:43.260 --> 00:14:46.540
And the Fulani were educated.

00:14:46.540 --> 00:14:48.460
They had European weapons.

00:14:48.460 --> 00:14:50.120
They had discipline.

00:14:50.120 --> 00:14:51.990
And so when they moved
into these countries,

00:14:51.990 --> 00:14:54.010
of course there were
indigenous people that didn't

00:14:54.010 --> 00:14:56.960
like the Fulani coming in,
and so there was warfare.

00:14:56.960 --> 00:15:00.020
And this period of warfare
lasted quite a while.

00:15:00.020 --> 00:15:05.440
But the net effect was when the
Fulani won, as they usually did,

00:15:05.440 --> 00:15:08.500
they would take their
enemy as prisoners of war,

00:15:08.500 --> 00:15:10.610
and would sell them
to the slave ships.

00:15:10.610 --> 00:15:13.020
So that's how the slave
ships got cargo.

00:15:13.020 --> 00:15:17.360
Now of course sometimes the
Fulani lost, and when they did,

00:15:17.360 --> 00:15:20.000
they got sold to the slave ships.

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:22.560 position:56%
The slave ship captains didn't care.

00:15:22.560 --> 00:15:25.490
As long as the people were black,
they were buying them as slaves

00:15:25.490 --> 00:15:27.220
and taking them to America.

00:15:27.220 --> 00:15:28.520
But that's how we ended

00:15:28.520 --> 00:15:34.750
up with educated Fulani
Muslims in the slave trade.

00:15:34.750 --> 00:15:38.270
When John Newton campaigned to
end the slave trade in England,

00:15:38.270 --> 00:15:43.490
this picture was -- this drawing
was sent around a lot to build

00:15:43.490 --> 00:15:45.690
up public support to
abolish the slave trade.

00:15:45.690 --> 00:15:48.590
To show how terrible the
conditions were on the ships.

00:15:48.590 --> 00:15:49.890
And it does do that.

00:15:49.890 --> 00:15:52.500
It shows you all the
crowding on the ships.

00:15:52.500 --> 00:15:58.570 position:56%
But my problem with this as a writer
who's trying to convey a message is

00:15:58.570 --> 00:16:02.100
that you can't really
see any of those faces,

00:16:02.100 --> 00:16:04.760
and I wanted to humanize the story.

00:16:04.760 --> 00:16:09.100
And one way you do that is with
this man, Ayuba Suleiman Diallo.

00:16:09.100 --> 00:16:10.470
He was a Fulani Muslim.

00:16:10.470 --> 00:16:15.860
He came to Maryland again,
1730 -- 22 years before Yarrow.

00:16:15.860 --> 00:16:20.510
He was educated, sixteen years
old, roughly -- teenager.

00:16:20.510 --> 00:16:23.360
When he got here, he
could read and write.

00:16:23.360 --> 00:16:27.460
When he got here, he'd pray
on the ground as a Muslim,

00:16:27.460 --> 00:16:31.430
and people would kick dirt in
his face to make fun of him.

00:16:31.430 --> 00:16:33.890
He was pretty unhappy,
and so he did something

00:16:33.890 --> 00:16:35.660
that you wouldn't think of.

00:16:35.660 --> 00:16:38.790
He wrote a letter to his
father in Africa, and said,

00:16:38.790 --> 00:16:41.390
"Dad, get me out of here."

00:16:41.390 --> 00:16:44.650
You know, the notion today --
we look back, and you know,

00:16:44.650 --> 00:16:47.550
we have this history -- our
own conceptions of slavery,

00:16:47.550 --> 00:16:50.820
the notion of the slave would think
that he could write his father back

00:16:50.820 --> 00:16:54.330
in Africa and get out of
here is sort of preposterous.

00:16:54.330 --> 00:16:57.380
Well, he didn't get out that way,

00:16:57.380 --> 00:17:00.420
but people in England
intercepted his letter.

00:17:00.420 --> 00:17:02.910
They said, "My gosh, there's
this educated slave in Maryland.

00:17:02.910 --> 00:17:04.570
Let's bring him to England."

00:17:04.570 --> 00:17:06.090
And so he was sent to England,

00:17:06.090 --> 00:17:08.980
and this painting was
done by William Hoare.

00:17:08.980 --> 00:17:12.690
He was a student of the
great Thomas Gainsborough.

00:17:12.690 --> 00:17:15.710
And I tell all this story not only
to tell you a little bit about race

00:17:15.710 --> 00:17:20.320
in America, but also to point out
that of the 9.6 million people

00:17:20.320 --> 00:17:22.650
who went on those slave ships,

00:17:22.650 --> 00:17:26.270
there are only two
portraits by major artists.

00:17:26.270 --> 00:17:31.110
Ayuba Suleiman Diallo and Yarrow
Mamout by Charles Wilson Peale.

00:17:31.110 --> 00:17:33.500
And so these -- you know,
as I got into this story,

00:17:33.500 --> 00:17:36.780
I saw how rare this
story was becoming

00:17:36.780 --> 00:17:38.280
and how rare that portrait is.

00:17:38.280 --> 00:17:40.960
We don't know enough about
black history to know

00:17:40.960 --> 00:17:44.090
that this portrait is precious,
and we're seeing the faces

00:17:44.090 --> 00:17:45.830
of people who were on slave ships.

00:17:45.830 --> 00:17:49.060
And I remind people, this
isn't what we thought.

00:17:49.060 --> 00:17:52.280
You know, this isn't the modern
concept of what slaves looked like.

00:17:52.280 --> 00:17:56.930 position:56%
We don't see them as these very
educated men, but many of them were.

00:17:59.160 --> 00:18:03.910
Yarrow came in here, 1752,
to Annapolis, Maryland.

00:18:03.910 --> 00:18:06.240
That's the Chesapeake
Bay and the Severn River,

00:18:06.240 --> 00:18:08.600
and that's the Naval Academy.

00:18:08.600 --> 00:18:12.480
I once tried to sell this book to
the Naval Institute, saying, "Well,

00:18:12.480 --> 00:18:15.430
you know, he did come
in to Annapolis,"

00:18:15.430 --> 00:18:16.820
but they didn't see it that way.

00:18:16.820 --> 00:18:22.680
Anyway, you know, if you have
an imagination enough, and I do.

00:18:22.680 --> 00:18:27.050
I'm not sure you all do, but if you
look down at that football field

00:18:27.050 --> 00:18:29.910
at the Naval Academy, or at
the practice fields there,

00:18:29.910 --> 00:18:32.610
I can see this little
nine-year-old boy.

00:18:32.610 --> 00:18:35.840
And that nine-year-old boy
there is Charles Wilson Peale.

00:18:35.840 --> 00:18:39.080
He was living in Annapolis
at the time Yarrow came in.

00:18:39.080 --> 00:18:41.280
And so he never made the
connection many years later

00:18:41.280 --> 00:18:44.240
that he probably saw Yarrow
come off that slave ship

00:18:44.240 --> 00:18:47.880
because there are not that many
slave ships coming into Annapolis.

00:18:47.880 --> 00:18:54.490
And this is the ad from
the Maryland Gazette, 1752.

00:18:54.490 --> 00:18:57.190
"Just imported in the
Elijah," -- that was the name,

00:18:57.190 --> 00:18:59.870
"Captain James Lowndes, directly
from the coast of Africa.

00:18:59.870 --> 00:19:03.320
Parcel of healthy slaves consisting
of men, women, and children,

00:19:03.320 --> 00:19:07.690
and will be disposed of onboard
the said vessel in the Sevren River

00:19:07.690 --> 00:19:10.480
on Tuesday, the fourth day
of June, for sterling money.

00:19:10.480 --> 00:19:11.780
Bills are exchanged.

00:19:11.780 --> 00:19:13.400
Gold or paper currency.

00:19:13.400 --> 00:19:14.830
Benjamin Tasker, Jr."

00:19:14.830 --> 00:19:18.180
And my friend, Christopher
Lowndes that owned Bladensburg.

00:19:18.180 --> 00:19:19.480
They were brothers-in-law.

00:19:19.480 --> 00:19:21.440 position:56%
Lowndes had married Tasker's sister.

00:19:21.440 --> 00:19:23.720 position:56%
Tasker was the governor of Maryland.

00:19:23.720 --> 00:19:27.770
Again, how high up in the early
government the slave trade went.

00:19:27.770 --> 00:19:30.890
This is the transatlantic
slave trade, which is, I think,

00:19:30.890 --> 00:19:35.500
different in concept
from just slave markets.

00:19:35.500 --> 00:19:38.750
And I got a picture because I
do like you to see pictures.

00:19:38.750 --> 00:19:43.050
I got a picture of Elizabeth Tasker
Lowndes, Christopher Lowndes' wife,

00:19:43.050 --> 00:19:45.670
also painted by Charles
Wilson Peale.

00:19:45.670 --> 00:19:48.930
And I must say that I am
not doing her a favor.

00:19:48.930 --> 00:19:52.210
She was truly on death's
bed when this was done.

00:19:52.210 --> 00:19:54.390
Charles Wilson Peale was
going through Bladensburg,

00:19:54.390 --> 00:19:56.340
and they asked him
to paint a portrait

00:19:56.340 --> 00:19:58.430
for her grandchildren
before she died.

00:19:58.430 --> 00:20:01.640
She died a few days after
this portrait was done.

00:20:01.640 --> 00:20:06.150 position:56%
But again, I'm showing you portraits
of people, of what it was like then.

00:20:06.150 --> 00:20:09.190
Now let's go to Yarrow Mamout.

00:20:09.190 --> 00:20:16.960
He's come in on June 4th, 1752, and
he was purchased by Samuel Bell,

00:20:16.960 --> 00:20:20.740
who owned Yarrow from 1752 to 1777.

00:20:20.740 --> 00:20:24.310
Then his son, Brook Bell, and
then finally Upton Bell --

00:20:24.310 --> 00:20:26.310
and I have a picture of Upton --

00:20:26.310 --> 00:20:31.240
signed Yarrow's freedom
papers in 1796.

00:20:31.240 --> 00:20:33.790
I'm going to go through
these people.

00:20:33.790 --> 00:20:35.090
First, Samuel Bell.

00:20:35.090 --> 00:20:40.740 position:56%
He was the kind of man that Lord
Baltimore wanted when he was saying,

00:20:40.740 --> 00:20:42.770
you know, "Do things
industrious in the New World.

00:20:42.770 --> 00:20:44.500
Do things that export."

00:20:44.500 --> 00:20:47.630
Samuel Bell's specialty,
he was sort of an engineer,

00:20:47.630 --> 00:20:49.590
but his specialty was watermills.

00:20:49.590 --> 00:20:53.180
And that was the only form of
power we had in America other

00:20:53.180 --> 00:20:54.550
than human and animal muscle.

00:20:54.550 --> 00:20:57.490
So that was a big step
up for America.

00:20:57.490 --> 00:21:00.240
This picture is of Peirce
Mill down in Rock Creek.

00:21:00.240 --> 00:21:01.970
Everybody knows Peirce Mill.

00:21:01.970 --> 00:21:04.990
Samuel Bell was the man
who first put a mill there,

00:21:04.990 --> 00:21:07.440
and he put several
mills up in Rock Creek.

00:21:07.440 --> 00:21:12.180
And these were used to
saw wood or grind grain,

00:21:12.180 --> 00:21:16.360
but they were also used -- Samuel
Bell was really a very smart guy

00:21:16.360 --> 00:21:21.570
because in 1764, he moved up
here to Antietam Ironworks,

00:21:21.570 --> 00:21:25.370
up by Antietam Battlefield,
at the mouth of the Potomac --

00:21:25.370 --> 00:21:27.320
Antietam Creek and
the Potomac River.

00:21:27.320 --> 00:21:29.450
He moved up there because
there was an ironworks,

00:21:29.450 --> 00:21:33.470
and they used water power
to pound and refine iron,

00:21:33.470 --> 00:21:35.730
and that was his specialty.

00:21:35.730 --> 00:21:37.650
So he was a very prominent man.

00:21:37.650 --> 00:21:42.760
And in fact, he was an early
revolutionary in Maryland.

00:21:42.760 --> 00:21:45.680
Supported the American
Revolution, believed in it,

00:21:45.680 --> 00:21:49.080
was a big proponent of
overthrowing England.

00:21:49.080 --> 00:21:51.420
He had this house which is
still there, the brick house,

00:21:51.420 --> 00:21:55.060
called Kelly's Purchase,
outside Sharpsburg, Maryland.

00:21:55.060 --> 00:22:01.260
And he worked at that iron
mill for the rest of his life.

00:22:01.260 --> 00:22:07.120
And in 1777, he died,
and I got his will.

00:22:07.120 --> 00:22:10.830
And I know Yarrow is with him
because I got Samuel Bell's will.

00:22:10.830 --> 00:22:16.390 position:56%
And in the will there's a
reference "to my negro boy, Jarrow."

00:22:16.390 --> 00:22:19.190
And you know, how you
spell the word "Yarrow,"

00:22:19.190 --> 00:22:21.040
doesn't make a whole
lot of difference.

00:22:21.040 --> 00:22:22.600
That's Yarrow Mamout.

00:22:22.600 --> 00:22:24.910
They have taken Yarrow
from Washington all the way

00:22:24.910 --> 00:22:27.450 position:56%
up to Washington County, Sharpsburg.

00:22:27.450 --> 00:22:32.300
And the word "boy" today, for
a black man, is an insult.

00:22:32.300 --> 00:22:35.420
But back in those times, it
meant something different.

00:22:35.420 --> 00:22:38.630
It was your body servant,
and it was a good deal

00:22:38.630 --> 00:22:40.660
for -- if you were white.

00:22:40.660 --> 00:22:43.360
Because your body servant
was more than a valet.

00:22:43.360 --> 00:22:47.030
He was someone who
went with you all day.

00:22:47.030 --> 00:22:49.660
If you were on the road a
lot like Samuel Bell was,

00:22:49.660 --> 00:22:52.980
he owned 63 properties
during his lifetime,

00:22:52.980 --> 00:22:55.050 position:56%
so he's constantly traveling around.

00:22:55.050 --> 00:22:58.610
He was sheriff of Frederick County,
so he was constantly on the move.

00:22:58.610 --> 00:23:01.930
Your body servant was a second gun.

00:23:01.930 --> 00:23:04.240
He was someone to talk to
when you were on the road.

00:23:04.240 --> 00:23:07.690
And when you got to where
you're going at night, the inn,

00:23:07.690 --> 00:23:11.580
you got to go in and have a leg
of mutton and a stein of ale.

00:23:11.580 --> 00:23:14.060
And your body servant
put the horses away.

00:23:14.060 --> 00:23:15.900
So that's the role
of a body servant.

00:23:15.900 --> 00:23:19.580
But it also meant, it
wasn't that bad for Yarrow.

00:23:19.580 --> 00:23:24.090
First of all, slaves were not
permitted to leave the plantation,

00:23:24.090 --> 00:23:26.690
so they couldn't see the country.

00:23:26.690 --> 00:23:29.570
Yarrow Mamout was able to travel
around the state of Maryland

00:23:29.570 --> 00:23:35.690
and see what America was all about
in a way that most slaves couldn't.

00:23:35.690 --> 00:23:39.180
He was also with Samuel Bell
whenever Samuel Bell would talk

00:23:39.180 --> 00:23:43.130
to people and Samuel Bell knew
a lot of important people.

00:23:43.130 --> 00:23:45.410
So Yarrow got to meet
all these people.

00:23:45.410 --> 00:23:49.050
And ultimately, when Yarrow
got free and in Georgetown,

00:23:49.050 --> 00:23:52.520
all these people were the big rich
and famous people in Georgetown,

00:23:52.520 --> 00:23:56.460
and they had met Yarrow many, many
years earlier with Samuel Bell.

00:23:56.460 --> 00:24:00.260
So they knew that he was a
reliable, decent human being.

00:24:00.260 --> 00:24:03.660
So it was good for
Yarrow Mamout, too.

00:24:03.660 --> 00:24:06.250
Upon Bell's death,
Yarrow Mamout went

00:24:06.250 --> 00:24:10.360
to Brook Bell, Samuel Bell's son.

00:24:10.360 --> 00:24:12.800
If you go out to Potomac,
Maryland, along River Road,

00:24:12.800 --> 00:24:17.330
you'll come to this: Bell Mountain
Road, and Bell Spring Road.

00:24:17.330 --> 00:24:21.280
The Bell's had an estate out there
called Belmont that was 2000 acres,

00:24:21.280 --> 00:24:23.530
and Yarrow settled there.

00:24:23.530 --> 00:24:24.970
Now, I think about this time,

00:24:24.970 --> 00:24:27.400
you're asking me how do
you know all these things?

00:24:27.400 --> 00:24:28.700
Who wrote this all up?

00:24:28.700 --> 00:24:30.470
Well, nobody wrote
it up, I wrote it up.

00:24:30.470 --> 00:24:32.850
But I'm going to start telling you
how I know some of these things.

00:24:32.850 --> 00:24:38.060
First of all, how do I know
that Yarrow Mamout was there?

00:24:38.060 --> 00:24:40.260
Because across the road
from that sign is this:

00:24:40.260 --> 00:24:42.490
it's the ruins of a watermill.

00:24:42.490 --> 00:24:44.630
Bell had a watermill
on that property.

00:24:44.630 --> 00:24:46.880
And on that hill, you
see in the background,

00:24:46.880 --> 00:24:48.940
that was a different plantation.

00:24:48.940 --> 00:24:55.630
And on that plantation, to a slave
woman, was born Yarrow's son.

00:24:55.630 --> 00:25:00.580
So I'm pretty sure that Yarrow
Mamout was there nine months before

00:25:00.580 --> 00:25:03.270
that little boy was
born on that hillside.

00:25:03.270 --> 00:25:06.230
And obviously, he was working
on Belmont for his owner,

00:25:06.230 --> 00:25:10.140
probably working on the
watermills and met a woman

00:25:10.140 --> 00:25:13.330
on the adjoining plantation,
and had a child with her.

00:25:13.330 --> 00:25:16.680
But it was more than just a
casual affair, because seven years

00:25:16.680 --> 00:25:18.790
after that boy was born,
his name was Aquilla,

00:25:18.790 --> 00:25:23.990
seven years after he was born,
Yarrow bought the boy's freedom.

00:25:23.990 --> 00:25:26.250
So it meant that Yarrow stayed
in contact with the boy,

00:25:26.250 --> 00:25:28.090
probably stayed in
contact with his mother.

00:25:28.090 --> 00:25:30.740
Probably his mother
was virtually a wife,

00:25:30.740 --> 00:25:34.010
and got the boy's freedom
at that point in time.

00:25:34.010 --> 00:25:40.100
1790 though, by 1790,
Yarrow is in Georgetown,

00:25:40.100 --> 00:25:42.460
and this is Brook Bell's
ledger book.

00:25:42.460 --> 00:25:45.220
MDHS is the Maryland
State Historical Society:

00:25:45.220 --> 00:25:48.540
they make you put an acetate cover
over it if you take a picture.

00:25:48.540 --> 00:25:50.280
And there you can see
there is an entry

00:25:50.280 --> 00:25:52.790
in the accounting book
for Yarrow Mamout.

00:25:52.790 --> 00:25:56.290
So Brook Bell was handling
Yarrow's money.

00:25:56.290 --> 00:25:59.480
And by -- you know, selling him
goods and also keeping accounts,

00:25:59.480 --> 00:26:01.960
other accounts for Yarrow
Mamout in Georgetown.

00:26:01.960 --> 00:26:05.260
They had moved from
Potomac into Georgetown.

00:26:05.260 --> 00:26:07.870 position:56%
And Brook Bell was a merchant there.

00:26:07.870 --> 00:26:13.470
And then Brook Bell died in 1796.

00:26:13.470 --> 00:26:17.310
This is the inventory of
his estate, and I don't know

00:26:17.310 --> 00:26:21.140
if you can see the yellow,
but there is Yarrow's name.

00:26:21.140 --> 00:26:23.690
And this is another
way I know some things.

00:26:23.690 --> 00:26:28.450
It said that in 1796,
Yarrow is 60 years old.

00:26:28.450 --> 00:26:33.770
So you subtract 60 from 1796,
Yarrow was born roughly in 1736.

00:26:33.770 --> 00:26:37.870
So that gives me a date
of birth of Yarrow.

00:26:37.870 --> 00:26:43.570
When Yarrow was -- when
Brook Bell died, though,

00:26:43.570 --> 00:26:44.870
he had cut this deal with Yarrow.

00:26:44.870 --> 00:26:48.340 position:56%
He said, "Yarrow, if you make bricks
for the new house, I'll free you."

00:26:48.340 --> 00:26:52.310
And Yarrow made the bricks for the
new house, but Brook Bell died,

00:26:52.310 --> 00:26:54.430
and so the widow freed Yarrow.

00:26:54.430 --> 00:26:58.790
Now Yarrow was recorded
as explaining this story,

00:26:58.790 --> 00:27:00.530
and before I show you
what Yarrow said,

00:27:00.530 --> 00:27:02.940
let me point out about his dialect.

00:27:02.940 --> 00:27:04.770
Yarrow, of course,
was a Fulani Muslim.

00:27:04.770 --> 00:27:09.180
So his first language was
Fulani, an African language.

00:27:09.180 --> 00:27:10.950
But I know he could read
and write in Arabic.

00:27:10.950 --> 00:27:14.230
And as a Muslim, he would have
had some familiarity with Arabic.

00:27:14.230 --> 00:27:16.870
So there's language two.

00:27:16.870 --> 00:27:19.840
If he was from Senegal,
that was a French colony,

00:27:19.840 --> 00:27:21.740
he would have to speak French.

00:27:21.740 --> 00:27:26.500
A lot of -- everyone from Senegal
today speaks French and English.

00:27:26.500 --> 00:27:29.040
Or if he was from Guinea, he
spoke English, and in any event,

00:27:29.040 --> 00:27:30.920
once he got here, he spoke English.

00:27:30.920 --> 00:27:35.460
So Yarrow in this quote is speaking
in his third or fourth language.

00:27:35.460 --> 00:27:38.420
And this -- he was so famous
in Georgetown, somebody wrote

00:27:38.420 --> 00:27:42.930
down his actual words to show
how -- the speech pattern.

00:27:42.930 --> 00:27:44.920
And Yarrow talking
about how he got free.

00:27:44.920 --> 00:27:48.240
"Olda massa been tink he got
all de work out of a Yaro bone.

00:27:48.240 --> 00:27:50.710
He tell a Yaro, go free
Yaro; you been work nuff

00:27:50.710 --> 00:27:52.650
for me, go work for you now.

00:27:52.650 --> 00:27:54.290
'Tanky, massa,' Yaro say.

00:27:54.290 --> 00:27:56.710
Sure nuff, Yaro go
to work for he now.

00:27:56.710 --> 00:27:59.910
Yaro work a soon -- a
late -- a hot -- a cold.

00:27:59.910 --> 00:28:02.450
Sometime he sweat --
sometime he blow a finger."

00:28:02.450 --> 00:28:05.660
Well, you've got to look
at the poetry in this.

00:28:05.660 --> 00:28:07.470
First of all, he know
-- and he's working

00:28:07.470 --> 00:28:09.240
in a third or fourth language.

00:28:09.240 --> 00:28:12.230
First of all, he knows his
name rhymes with "marrow bone,"

00:28:12.230 --> 00:28:14.420
so he's making a play
on words, saying,

00:28:14.420 --> 00:28:16.800
"Get all de work out
of a Yaro bone."

00:28:16.800 --> 00:28:19.240
But then what I really like here
is at the end where he's saying,

00:28:19.240 --> 00:28:21.520
"sometime he sweat,
sometime he blow a finger."

00:28:21.520 --> 00:28:24.860
I was thinking, you know,
like a kid playing with a gun.

00:28:24.860 --> 00:28:27.540
A cowboy. You blow the
smoke out of your pistol.

00:28:27.540 --> 00:28:28.910
No, he means it's cold,
[puff of air sound]

00:28:28.910 --> 00:28:30.670
and he's blowing on his finger.

00:28:30.670 --> 00:28:31.970
So sometimes he sweats.

00:28:31.970 --> 00:28:33.690
Sometimes he has to [puff
of air sound] blow a finger.

00:28:33.690 --> 00:28:35.460
And it's sort of one of
my favorite expressions.

00:28:35.460 --> 00:28:36.760
You know, I get cold in the winter,

00:28:36.760 --> 00:28:38.880
and I've got to blow a
finger [puff of air sound].

00:28:38.880 --> 00:28:42.080
Anyway, so Yarrow gets free in1796.

00:28:42.080 --> 00:28:47.000
And he eventually buys this house,
and this is the lot in Georgetown.

00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:48.400
You've got maps.

00:28:48.400 --> 00:28:50.350
Ellen's got some maps
here of Georgetown.

00:28:50.350 --> 00:28:54.020
His address was 3324
Debt Place in Georgetown.

00:28:54.020 --> 00:28:56.470
This is 3324 Debt Place.

00:28:56.470 --> 00:28:58.420
And he put up a house there.

00:28:58.420 --> 00:29:00.540
It was a log house,
and it's gone now.

00:29:00.540 --> 00:29:02.470 position:56%
And we'll get into that a bit later.

00:29:02.470 --> 00:29:06.180
But in -- after he bought that
house in 1800, he turned around

00:29:06.180 --> 00:29:09.840
and resold it to his son,
for reasons I won't get into.

00:29:09.840 --> 00:29:13.150
But I do have his deed --

00:29:13.150 --> 00:29:17.000
at the National Archives is
preserved his deed of sale.

00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:19.690
And the Recorder of Deeds
then and the Recorder

00:29:19.690 --> 00:29:21.790
of Deeds today operate
in the same way.

00:29:21.790 --> 00:29:24.060
They are a point of record.

00:29:24.060 --> 00:29:27.800 position:56%
Today, if you sell a house, you take
the deed into the Recorder of Deeds,

00:29:27.800 --> 00:29:30.970
and he'll put a camera on
it and take a photograph,

00:29:30.970 --> 00:29:35.140
or as I would say,
make a Xerox copy.

00:29:35.140 --> 00:29:39.540
In those days, the Recorder of
Deeds was a human Xerox machine.

00:29:39.540 --> 00:29:43.710 position:56%
You brought the deed in, and he
would make an exact copy in his big,

00:29:43.710 --> 00:29:45.670
beautiful handwriting
like you can see here.

00:29:45.670 --> 00:29:48.360
And you can see what
a good writer he was.

00:29:48.360 --> 00:29:50.320
Big, great penmanship.

00:29:50.320 --> 00:29:53.760
Except where it comes to
Yarrow's signature there,

00:29:53.760 --> 00:29:56.030
below Francis Deakin's.

00:29:56.030 --> 00:29:59.970
And that obviously is
completely illegible.

00:29:59.970 --> 00:30:02.270 position:56%
While I had my suspicions when I was

00:30:02.270 --> 00:30:04.950
down at the National Archives
the day that I saw that,

00:30:04.950 --> 00:30:09.470
and so I sent it to an expert, who
showed me the [inaudible] alphabet,

00:30:09.470 --> 00:30:11.970
Arabic alphabet from Nigeria.

00:30:11.970 --> 00:30:14.710
And he looks at those words, and
he said, "The word that looks like

00:30:14.710 --> 00:30:20.340
"Josi" is probably his attempt to
spell Yarrow in English, J-a-r-o.

00:30:20.340 --> 00:30:22.160
The second word is pretty easy.

00:30:22.160 --> 00:30:23.460
It's Arabic.

00:30:23.460 --> 00:30:25.970
It's [inaudible], in
the name of God.

00:30:25.970 --> 00:30:29.770
So he has signed the deed as
"Yaro, in the name of God."

00:30:29.770 --> 00:30:33.700
I was giving this talk several
years ago, and before I even got

00:30:33.700 --> 00:30:35.000
to that point, somebody

00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:36.610
in the audience said,
"That says [inaudible]."

00:30:36.610 --> 00:30:40.770
And she was Egyptian, and she
could read it very, quite easily.

00:30:40.770 --> 00:30:43.820
Even though it's the -- probably a
copy made by the Recorder of Deeds,

00:30:43.820 --> 00:30:45.990
not the actual signature of Yarrow.

00:30:45.990 --> 00:30:48.970
In any event, it shows that he
could read and write in Arabic.

00:30:51.250 --> 00:30:53.560
And then the great Charles
Wilson Peale comes to town.

00:30:53.560 --> 00:30:56.390
Peale had been not only
a portrait painter,

00:30:56.390 --> 00:30:57.690
he had been in the military.

00:30:57.690 --> 00:30:59.400
He crossed the Delaware
with Washington.

00:30:59.400 --> 00:31:01.130
He didn't paint that portrait.

00:31:01.130 --> 00:31:02.470
And then he opened a museum

00:31:02.470 --> 00:31:04.710
after the Revolutionary
War in Philadelphia.

00:31:04.710 --> 00:31:09.000
And this is his self-portrait,
beckoning you into the museum.

00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:12.160
It was a lot like the Smithsonian,
except it was for profit.

00:31:12.160 --> 00:31:13.990
And so you'd go in there,
and you could see there

00:31:13.990 --> 00:31:15.380
that he had these fossils.

00:31:15.380 --> 00:31:17.950
He had pictures of birds.

00:31:17.950 --> 00:31:20.660
And he also had a presidential
gallery

00:31:20.660 --> 00:31:23.450
where he had portraits
of all the presidents.

00:31:23.450 --> 00:31:25.480
You know, today we know
what Washington looks like.

00:31:25.480 --> 00:31:27.710
We know -- we're in
the Madison Building.

00:31:27.710 --> 00:31:29.100
We know what Madison looks

00:31:29.100 --> 00:31:31.760
like because there are
copies all over the place.

00:31:31.760 --> 00:31:33.410
Back then there were
not photographs.

00:31:33.410 --> 00:31:35.950
The only way you could see what
these guys looked like was to go

00:31:35.950 --> 00:31:37.570
to a museum and look at a portrait.

00:31:37.570 --> 00:31:41.750
And Peale was the big
presidential portrait painter.

00:31:41.750 --> 00:31:43.830
So he's welcomed many people in.

00:31:43.830 --> 00:31:47.980
And he came to Washington for
a number of reasons in 1818,

00:31:47.980 --> 00:31:50.160
including to get a
portrait of James Madison --

00:31:50.160 --> 00:31:53.870 position:56%
or James Monroe, who was the new
president, for his portrait gallery.

00:31:53.870 --> 00:31:57.650 position:56%
When he wrote in his diary, "I heard
of a negro living in Georgetown.

00:31:57.650 --> 00:31:59.760
Said to be 140 years old.

00:31:59.760 --> 00:32:03.120
I propose to make a portrait
of him if I get a chance."

00:32:03.120 --> 00:32:05.410
Yarrow was not 140.

00:32:05.410 --> 00:32:09.240
That was fiction, but
Yarrow did own bank stock.

00:32:09.240 --> 00:32:12.630
He was an entrepreneur, and so
Peale got interested in this.

00:32:12.630 --> 00:32:16.730
And so Peale painted that portrait.

00:32:16.730 --> 00:32:20.010
While he did that, he took
information from Yarrow

00:32:20.010 --> 00:32:22.180
and other people about
Yarrow's life.

00:32:22.180 --> 00:32:24.700
And that helped me
reconstruct Yarrow's life.

00:32:24.700 --> 00:32:29.910
For example, the woman who had --
the widow who freed Yarrow said,

00:32:29.910 --> 00:32:35.370
"He was about 14 or a little bit
older when he came to America."

00:32:35.370 --> 00:32:38.780
Well, Yarrow would be
16 by my reckoning.

00:32:38.780 --> 00:32:42.720
"My father-in-law bought
him right off the ship."

00:32:42.720 --> 00:32:44.020
It all fit.

00:32:44.020 --> 00:32:48.910 position:56%
The Elijah was the only ship to come
from Muslim areas of West Africa

00:32:48.910 --> 00:32:52.730
for many years in that time period,
so Yarrow had to be on that ship.

00:32:52.730 --> 00:32:56.490
And it all fit with what these
people were saying about him.

00:32:56.490 --> 00:32:58.280
But look at this portrait.

00:32:58.280 --> 00:33:01.810
You see here -- there
is no evidence of this.

00:33:01.810 --> 00:33:04.850
This is all Jim Johnston
speculation.

00:33:04.850 --> 00:33:07.240
First of all, you see that big,
great leather coat over him.

00:33:07.240 --> 00:33:08.540
That's Peale's coat.

00:33:08.540 --> 00:33:09.840
Yarrow couldn't afford that.

00:33:09.840 --> 00:33:11.140
That's a leather coat
-- he couldn't--

00:33:11.140 --> 00:33:15.860
this was done in January,
late January of 1819.

00:33:15.860 --> 00:33:17.640
And so Yarrow is all bundled up.

00:33:17.640 --> 00:33:20.890
He's pretty cold, but
Peale's painting him.

00:33:20.890 --> 00:33:25.740
But Peale had owned
slaves in his life.

00:33:25.740 --> 00:33:29.700
But by this time, Peale's an
older man now, and more wiser.

00:33:29.700 --> 00:33:32.520
Peale got this revolutionary
notion that black people

00:33:32.520 --> 00:33:34.020
and white people were equal.

00:33:34.020 --> 00:33:36.880
You know, it wasn't just
they had equal rights,

00:33:36.880 --> 00:33:38.310
he thought they were equal.

00:33:38.310 --> 00:33:40.380
And he thought the only
difference between black people

00:33:40.380 --> 00:33:42.830 position:56%
and white people was the skin color.

00:33:42.830 --> 00:33:47.000
And that if you gave a black
person equal opportunities,

00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:51.320
he could be just -- he or she
could be just as prosperous

00:33:51.320 --> 00:33:53.310
and famous as a white person.

00:33:53.310 --> 00:33:55.850
And I think that's what
you see in this portrait.

00:33:55.850 --> 00:34:01.120
You see Charles Wilson Peale
painting a wealthy merchant

00:34:01.120 --> 00:34:04.330
in Georgetown who just
happens to be black.

00:34:04.330 --> 00:34:07.600
And I think he was
sending a political message

00:34:07.600 --> 00:34:09.220
out with this portrait.

00:34:09.220 --> 00:34:12.720
And in any event, Yarrow died.

00:34:12.720 --> 00:34:15.840
That's the house in Georgetown
where the widow lived.

00:34:15.840 --> 00:34:18.820
And I can imagine Peale going
up there and talking to him.

00:34:18.820 --> 00:34:21.670
But Yarrow died shortly
after the second portrait

00:34:21.670 --> 00:34:25.910
in 1823, and here's his obituary.

00:34:25.910 --> 00:34:29.000
This is a black man who
came on a slave ship.

00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:30.990
And he's got an obituary
in the newspaper.

00:34:30.990 --> 00:34:33.520
You know, this isn't little,
trivial stuff, you know.

00:34:33.520 --> 00:34:35.850
This is pretty significant stuff.

00:34:35.850 --> 00:34:38.180
"Died at Georgetown on
the 19th [inaudible]."

00:34:38.180 --> 00:34:42.360
That's the prior month,
so 19th of January, 1823.

00:34:42.360 --> 00:34:46.090
"Negro Yarrow, aged according
to his account, 136 years.

00:34:46.090 --> 00:34:47.870
He was interred in the
corner of the garden,

00:34:47.870 --> 00:34:50.350
the spot where he usually
resorted to pray."

00:34:50.350 --> 00:34:51.660
And it goes on to tell the story.

00:34:51.660 --> 00:34:55.600
But my favorite part is
the last line that says,

00:34:55.600 --> 00:35:00.030
"Yarrow was never known to eat a
swine nor drink ardent spirits."

00:35:00.030 --> 00:35:03.090
You know, that was the
litmus test of a Muslim.

00:35:03.090 --> 00:35:05.670
He wouldn't drink alcohol,
and he wouldn't eat pig.

00:35:05.670 --> 00:35:07.990
And you know, I found that
throughout other parts

00:35:07.990 --> 00:35:11.050
of my research, whenever you come
across a Muslim, that was the thing

00:35:11.050 --> 00:35:12.520
that white people always noticed.

00:35:12.520 --> 00:35:15.460
They would offer them a glass
of wine, and they'd say no.

00:35:15.460 --> 00:35:17.020
Well, that's a Muslim.

00:35:17.020 --> 00:35:20.030
So this was sort of what
was common knowledge,

00:35:20.030 --> 00:35:22.950
apparently, among early Americans.

00:35:25.050 --> 00:35:27.350
That ends my Yarrow story,
and with the rest of my time,

00:35:27.350 --> 00:35:30.260
I'll go through the rest
of his family quickly.

00:35:30.260 --> 00:35:33.860
His sister, Hannah, Free
Hannah, or Hanna Peale.

00:35:33.860 --> 00:35:37.600
I don't have a lot about her, but
it does tell me a little bit more

00:35:37.600 --> 00:35:39.430 position:56%
about this story of race in America.

00:35:39.430 --> 00:35:41.950
His sister supposedly
came on the same ship.

00:35:41.950 --> 00:35:47.450
I can reconstruct that she was a
waitress here, a slave waitress

00:35:47.450 --> 00:35:51.010
at Hungerford's Tavern
in Rockville, Maryland.

00:35:51.010 --> 00:35:59.210
And I looked at the names of
the slaves who worked there.

00:35:59.210 --> 00:36:03.950
And these are slaves at Hungerford
that had African-sounding names.

00:36:03.950 --> 00:36:07.620
And so I -- I think there were
34 slaves, and these are the ones

00:36:07.620 --> 00:36:10.010
that I thought had
possibly African names.

00:36:10.010 --> 00:36:11.590
Well, there's something
that I haven't told you.

00:36:11.590 --> 00:36:15.470
Among the Fulani in West Africa,
there's a naming convention.

00:36:15.470 --> 00:36:17.580
When your child's born, you
go to a holy man and say,

00:36:17.580 --> 00:36:20.670
"What should I name
this boy or girl?"

00:36:20.670 --> 00:36:25.790
And if it was a boy, one of the
-- and the mother's fourth child,

00:36:25.790 --> 00:36:28.700
then one of the names is Yarrow.

00:36:28.700 --> 00:36:33.940
So "Yarrow" tells us that he
was his mother's fourth child.

00:36:33.940 --> 00:36:36.860
If he was born on a
Monday, Mohammad,

00:36:36.860 --> 00:36:39.200
Mamadu, or Mamout is the name.

00:36:39.200 --> 00:36:40.550
So "Yarrow Mamout" tells us

00:36:40.550 --> 00:36:43.620
that he was his mother's fourth
child and born on a Monday.

00:36:43.620 --> 00:36:46.970
But here at Hungerford's Tavern,
you see there's another Yarrow,

00:36:46.970 --> 00:36:49.290
the last name, so he's Fulani.

00:36:49.290 --> 00:36:52.080
And then I went through that naming
convention with these others,

00:36:52.080 --> 00:36:55.450
and I found one, two,
three, four, five --

00:36:55.450 --> 00:37:02.360
five slaves at that tavern who
are possibly Fulani Muslim.

00:37:02.360 --> 00:37:05.030
So it means that there
weren't just one man.

00:37:05.030 --> 00:37:06.810
It wasn't just an exception.

00:37:06.810 --> 00:37:09.470
There were a number
of Muslims who were

00:37:09.470 --> 00:37:13.950
in the Washington area
in Colonial times.

00:37:13.950 --> 00:37:15.970
And also met.

00:37:15.970 --> 00:37:18.030
I know that Yarrow stayed
in contact with his sister.

00:37:18.030 --> 00:37:22.470
It also meant that Yarrow probably
went out to the tavern in Rockville

00:37:22.470 --> 00:37:25.860
as the body servant to his owner
because his owner was clerk

00:37:25.860 --> 00:37:28.640
of the court in Rockville
and had business out there.

00:37:28.640 --> 00:37:30.800
So Yarrow would go with him.

00:37:30.800 --> 00:37:34.970
And then when his owner went to
do his business, Yarrow could go

00:37:34.970 --> 00:37:37.740
over to Hungerford's Tavern
and sit down with his sister

00:37:37.740 --> 00:37:39.740
and other Fulani Muslims.

00:37:39.740 --> 00:37:41.950
You know, we think
about Germans, Italians,

00:37:41.950 --> 00:37:45.230
Jews come to America,
they stick together.

00:37:45.230 --> 00:37:47.940
No reason to believe that
a Fulani wouldn't do that,

00:37:47.940 --> 00:37:49.960
Muslims wouldn't do that
if they had a chance.

00:37:49.960 --> 00:37:53.460
I think that happened in this case.

00:37:53.460 --> 00:37:57.350
Also living out there was
a man named Josiah Henson

00:37:57.350 --> 00:37:59.730
who wrote an autobiography
of his life

00:37:59.730 --> 00:38:03.220
that Harriet Beecher Stowe
turned into Uncle Tom's Cabin.

00:38:03.220 --> 00:38:07.230
The little black man there
being [inaudible] looks a lot

00:38:07.230 --> 00:38:08.830
like the real Josiah Henson.

00:38:08.830 --> 00:38:11.430
And Harriet Beecher
Stowe said she did use

00:38:11.430 --> 00:38:15.380 position:56%
that autobiography to base her book.

00:38:15.380 --> 00:38:20.620
Anyways, so Josiah Henson's
autobiography also happens to talk

00:38:20.620 --> 00:38:24.340
about what life was like in
Montgomery County at the same time

00:38:24.340 --> 00:38:26.870
that Yarrow was going
to the tavern out there.

00:38:26.870 --> 00:38:30.040
And especially the tavern
sort of interested me.

00:38:30.040 --> 00:38:33.480
And you know, it's funny, when
you talk about race, black people

00:38:33.480 --> 00:38:36.040
and white people sometimes
view things differently,

00:38:36.040 --> 00:38:37.340
and they did then.

00:38:37.340 --> 00:38:39.590
For example, the white people,

00:38:39.590 --> 00:38:42.700
here's what they thought
about those taverns.

00:38:42.700 --> 00:38:45.130
"In some of the taverns,
slaves sleep on the floor

00:38:45.130 --> 00:38:46.570
of the dining room,
which the master,

00:38:46.570 --> 00:38:49.380
for obvious reasons,
ought to forbid.

00:38:49.380 --> 00:38:53.510
They, [the slaves] have an uncommon
desire for spirituous liquors."

00:38:53.510 --> 00:38:55.720
You know, you see the
racism in that, you know.

00:38:55.720 --> 00:38:57.450
Black people drank too much.

00:38:57.450 --> 00:39:00.190
Okay, now we're going to look
though at what black people thought

00:39:00.190 --> 00:39:01.670
about white people, and we're going

00:39:01.670 --> 00:39:04.570
to see what Josiah
Henson said -- same place.

00:39:04.570 --> 00:39:07.010
This is the same place.

00:39:07.010 --> 00:39:08.310
"My master's habits were

00:39:08.310 --> 00:39:10.960
such as were common enough
among the dissipated planters

00:39:10.960 --> 00:39:13.800
of the neighborhood, and one
of their frequent practices was

00:39:13.800 --> 00:39:16.810
to assemble on Saturday or
Sunday which were their holidays,

00:39:16.810 --> 00:39:20.130
and gamble, run horses or fight
gamecocks, discuss politics,

00:39:20.130 --> 00:39:24.960
and drink whiskey and brandy
and water all day long.

00:39:24.960 --> 00:39:27.810
Perfectly aware that they would not
be able to find their own way home

00:39:27.810 --> 00:39:30.450
at night, each one ordered
his body servant to come

00:39:30.450 --> 00:39:32.460
after him and help him home.

00:39:32.460 --> 00:39:35.560
Quarrels and brawls of the most
violent description were frequent

00:39:35.560 --> 00:39:37.510
consequences of these meetings.

00:39:37.510 --> 00:39:40.630
And whenever they became especially
dangerous and glasses were thrown,

00:39:40.630 --> 00:39:44.500
dirks drawn, and pistols fired, it
was the duty of the slaves to rush

00:39:44.500 --> 00:39:48.740
in and each one drag his master
from the fight and carry him home."

00:39:48.740 --> 00:39:51.130
So you can see what the
black people thought

00:39:51.130 --> 00:39:52.730
about the white people's
drinking habits.

00:39:52.730 --> 00:39:55.470
You know, when we go through
history, you can get bigotry

00:39:55.470 --> 00:39:58.820
on both sides, although
this sounds pretty accurate.

00:40:00.100 --> 00:40:03.650
Next is Hannah's daughter,
Nancy Hillman.

00:40:03.650 --> 00:40:07.960
Hannah had worked at a tavern
where lawyers frequented

00:40:07.960 --> 00:40:09.460
because it was close
to the courthouse,

00:40:09.460 --> 00:40:13.000
and I think that's why Nancy
is -- a detail in the book,

00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:14.840
knew a lot about the law.

00:40:14.840 --> 00:40:18.900
But Nancy eventually moved --
Yarrow's niece, moved to Frederick,

00:40:18.900 --> 00:40:22.740
Maryland, and married a
man who was the servant

00:40:22.740 --> 00:40:25.860
or slave of Judge Richard Potts.

00:40:25.860 --> 00:40:27.490
So it all makes sense, you know.

00:40:27.490 --> 00:40:31.100
She worked in a tavern, she knew
lawyers, so she would marry a man

00:40:31.100 --> 00:40:32.640
who would be her social equal.

00:40:32.640 --> 00:40:36.570
A man who was familiar with the
law, and that all made sense.

00:40:36.570 --> 00:40:40.630
And the Hillman family was a
pretty prominent black family

00:40:40.630 --> 00:40:42.010
in Frederick, Maryland.

00:40:42.010 --> 00:40:45.170
And today, Frederick's a
small town, but in those days,

00:40:45.170 --> 00:40:48.350
it was sort of the legal capital of
the country because all the judges

00:40:48.350 --> 00:40:51.000
and justices were coming
out of Frederick, Maryland,

00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:56.210
including Chief Justice Roger Brook
Taney was a man from Frederick.

00:40:56.210 --> 00:41:00.260
And he knew Nancy Hillman,
and that's important.

00:41:00.260 --> 00:41:02.740
The Chief Justice of the United
States would have known the Hillman

00:41:02.740 --> 00:41:04.740
family and would have
known Nancy Hillman.

00:41:04.740 --> 00:41:06.940
And she was a pretty savvy woman.

00:41:06.940 --> 00:41:09.710
But Chief Justice Roger
Taney was also the man

00:41:09.710 --> 00:41:12.250
who wrote the decision
in Dred Scott.

00:41:12.250 --> 00:41:15.480
And as a story in race in America,
let's look at what this man,

00:41:15.480 --> 00:41:18.730
who knew Nancy Hillman,
said about black people.

00:41:18.730 --> 00:41:21.060
"They, [African Americans]
had for more than a century,

00:41:21.060 --> 00:41:23.540
before the Constitution,
been regarded as being

00:41:23.540 --> 00:41:27.250
of an inferior order, and
altogether unfit to associate

00:41:27.250 --> 00:41:30.950
with the white race either in
social or political relations.

00:41:30.950 --> 00:41:33.690
And so far inferior
that they had no rights

00:41:33.690 --> 00:41:35.700
which the white man
was bound to respect.

00:41:35.700 --> 00:41:38.300
And the negro might justly
and lawfully be reduced

00:41:38.300 --> 00:41:40.130
to slavery for his benefit."

00:41:40.130 --> 00:41:42.180
This was the most racist
decision ever to come

00:41:42.180 --> 00:41:44.900
out of the Supreme Court.

00:41:44.900 --> 00:41:48.010
So racist that in the
north, there were calls

00:41:48.010 --> 00:41:50.170
to abolish the Supreme Court.

00:41:50.170 --> 00:41:53.910 position:56%
The view being if we have a Supreme
Court Chief Justice saying this kind

00:41:53.910 --> 00:41:56.650
of stuff, we don't
need a Supreme Court.

00:41:56.650 --> 00:41:57.950
Now, why do I tell you this?

00:41:57.950 --> 00:41:59.540
Because it's a story
of race in America.

00:41:59.540 --> 00:42:02.380
It's a man who would have
known the Yarrow family.

00:42:02.380 --> 00:42:06.510
He knew Nancy Hillman, and he
was saying this kind of garbage.

00:42:06.510 --> 00:42:10.780
But in my research, I went
up to Frederick, Maryland,

00:42:10.780 --> 00:42:13.320
because I knew Nancy
Hillman died and was buried,

00:42:13.320 --> 00:42:16.900
and this is St. Paul, St.
John's Catholic Church

00:42:16.900 --> 00:42:18.200
in Frederick, Maryland.

00:42:18.200 --> 00:42:21.650
The cemetery, this tombstone
says "Hillman, Nanny Hillman."

00:42:21.650 --> 00:42:24.680
It's not Nancy, but it's
the Hillman section.

00:42:24.680 --> 00:42:27.890
The sexton of the cemetery told
me this is the black section,

00:42:27.890 --> 00:42:30.700
Catholic Church's cemetery.

00:42:30.700 --> 00:42:34.310
And so I'm sure that Nancy
Hillman, Yarrow's daughter --

00:42:34.310 --> 00:42:36.840
Yarrow's niece is buried here.

00:42:36.840 --> 00:42:39.040
But if you look past
that obelisk there,

00:42:39.040 --> 00:42:40.980
all the way over to the
other side of the seminary,

00:42:40.980 --> 00:42:43.920
and go there like I did,
you come to the grave

00:42:43.920 --> 00:42:46.780
Of Chief Justice Roger Taney.

00:42:46.780 --> 00:42:49.580
He's buried in an integrated
cemetery.

00:42:49.580 --> 00:42:53.060
So, you know, you may be
a racist in your life,

00:42:53.060 --> 00:42:56.320
but you can never control what
might happen to you in eternity.

00:42:56.320 --> 00:43:00.240
You just should remember that.

00:43:00.240 --> 00:43:01.540
Alright, so we're going on.

00:43:01.540 --> 00:43:03.730
I'm going to skip over
Aquilla Yarrow, Yarrow's son.

00:43:03.730 --> 00:43:06.300
A little bit, he died in 1832.

00:43:06.300 --> 00:43:12.030
But I wanted to focus on his
wife, Mary Turner or Polly Yarrow.

00:43:12.030 --> 00:43:16.610
First of all, Samuel Bell was in
business with a man named Turner.

00:43:16.610 --> 00:43:18.020
And in fact, they lived --

00:43:18.020 --> 00:43:20.890
had adjacent plantations
in Montgomery County.

00:43:20.890 --> 00:43:25.540
And so I think Yarrow's son,
Aquilla, married Mary Turner,

00:43:25.540 --> 00:43:29.400
a slave of Samuel Turner.

00:43:29.400 --> 00:43:32.380
Samuel Turner died in 1809.

00:43:32.380 --> 00:43:36.210 position:56%
He was register of Wills, worked out
of the same courthouse as Bell did.

00:43:36.210 --> 00:43:40.840
This is, excuse me, his signing
as the Register of Wills here,

00:43:40.840 --> 00:43:44.090
and the next will is his
because he has died in 1809.

00:43:44.090 --> 00:43:47.160 position:56%
So -- and he had a slave named Mary.

00:43:47.160 --> 00:43:52.900
I next see them up in
Washington County, up in 1832,

00:43:52.900 --> 00:43:56.200
and you see on the bottom right,
Mary Turner and Aquilla Yarrow.

00:43:56.200 --> 00:43:58.350
This is in a schedule
of free persons of color

00:43:58.350 --> 00:44:00.840
in Washington County, and
they're living together,

00:44:00.840 --> 00:44:02.790
actually as husband and wife.

00:44:02.790 --> 00:44:06.530
So you know, that's the connection,

00:44:06.530 --> 00:44:11.920
that Polly Yarrow is Yarrow
Mamout's daughter-in-law.

00:44:11.920 --> 00:44:14.430
And then Aquilla died
right after this was done.

00:44:14.430 --> 00:44:15.730
He died in 1832.

00:44:15.730 --> 00:44:21.260 position:56%
So I went and I got his inventory
of his estate and looked through it,

00:44:21.260 --> 00:44:26.860
and here is some of the things he
owned, including a lot of yarn.

00:44:26.860 --> 00:44:31.330
And you see in the margin, "Polly,"
meaning she owned that, not him.

00:44:31.330 --> 00:44:34.800
So I know that Polly and Aquilla
were living together as husband

00:44:34.800 --> 00:44:36.530
and wife in the same house.

00:44:36.530 --> 00:44:39.350
But one of the remarkable things

00:44:39.350 --> 00:44:43.170
about this inventory
is the last line here,

00:44:43.170 --> 00:44:45.660
that you see a lot of books.

00:44:45.660 --> 00:44:50.230
There's a black man living in
the middle of nowhere in 1832,

00:44:50.230 --> 00:44:53.040
on a tiny little farm,
and he's got books.

00:44:53.040 --> 00:44:54.690
Why would he have books?

00:44:54.690 --> 00:44:56.290
Because he can read.

00:44:56.290 --> 00:45:00.270
Yarrow Mamout had arranged
for him to learn to read.

00:45:00.270 --> 00:45:03.640
Otherwise there would have been
no reason for a black man, anyone,

00:45:03.640 --> 00:45:05.320
to have books if you can't read.

00:45:05.320 --> 00:45:08.840
So I think that Yarrow made
sure that his son got educated.

00:45:08.840 --> 00:45:12.230
But I was telling Ellen
this before my talk,

00:45:12.230 --> 00:45:15.300
and I said that at some point,
you know, I do like libraries.

00:45:15.300 --> 00:45:16.720
And I do like archives.

00:45:16.720 --> 00:45:19.400
It's a little tedious
to spend all day in a --

00:45:19.400 --> 00:45:22.110
but sometimes you've
just got to get out.

00:45:22.110 --> 00:45:24.070
And that happens even
in my research.

00:45:24.070 --> 00:45:27.140
So I thought, "You know,
I've just got to get out."

00:45:27.140 --> 00:45:31.060
My story was sort of coming to a
dead end, and so I thought, "Well,

00:45:31.060 --> 00:45:34.240
I'm going to go up to Antietam
and see what's up there."

00:45:34.240 --> 00:45:35.830
And when I did -- now
this is actually true.

00:45:35.830 --> 00:45:37.290
I'm not making this up.

00:45:37.290 --> 00:45:41.490
When I decided to go up to Antietam
to actually look at the ground,

00:45:41.490 --> 00:45:47.490
I was looking at a map, and
I saw this: Yarrowsburg Road.

00:45:47.490 --> 00:45:52.580
I had no idea there
was a Yarrowsburg Road,

00:45:52.580 --> 00:45:57.070
nor did I have any idea as to
why there was a Yarrowsburg Road.

00:45:57.070 --> 00:45:59.190
I would not have found
this in a library

00:45:59.190 --> 00:46:02.240
or book except by looking at a map.

00:46:02.240 --> 00:46:04.470
So I went in there, and this
is downtown Yarrowsburg,

00:46:04.470 --> 00:46:05.780
there's nothing there.

00:46:05.780 --> 00:46:09.570
But there were two men talking
over to the side of the road,

00:46:09.570 --> 00:46:11.270
so I went up to them, and I said,

00:46:11.270 --> 00:46:13.730
"Can you tell me why this
place is named Yarrowsburg?"

00:46:13.730 --> 00:46:16.590
And the one man, Bill
[inaudible] said, "Yes!

00:46:16.590 --> 00:46:20.810
My grandfather told me it was named
after a woman named Polly Yarrow."

00:46:20.810 --> 00:46:23.590
And you know, that
Polly in the margin

00:46:23.590 --> 00:46:25.980
of that was just sticking
in my head.

00:46:25.980 --> 00:46:29.170
But I'm a lawyer, and so
you don't lead witnesses.

00:46:29.170 --> 00:46:32.660
And you don't get good research if
you give them the answers you want.

00:46:32.660 --> 00:46:35.850
So I just waited him
out because I knew

00:46:35.850 --> 00:46:38.020
that he wanted to say
something else.

00:46:38.020 --> 00:46:39.320
And I just waited him out.

00:46:39.320 --> 00:46:43.380 position:56%
And finally, after about 15 seconds,
he said, "She was black, you know."

00:46:43.380 --> 00:46:45.870 position:56%
And that's what I wanted him to say.

00:46:45.870 --> 00:46:47.510
And he said, "She was
the midwife here.

00:46:47.510 --> 00:46:48.900
Delivered all the babies,
black and white.

00:46:48.900 --> 00:46:51.800
My grandfather told me that's
why this is Yarrowsburg."

00:46:51.800 --> 00:46:56.510
And so that added this whole
new dimension to this story.

00:46:56.510 --> 00:46:58.960
That hill in the background
is called Elk Ridge.

00:46:58.960 --> 00:47:00.730
The locals call it "the mountain."

00:47:00.730 --> 00:47:04.450
But if you go over that, as I did,
on foot -- there used to be a road,

00:47:04.450 --> 00:47:07.940
but if you go over it on foot, on
the other side, you come down here

00:47:07.940 --> 00:47:12.210 position:56%
to the Kennedy Farm, and many people
don't know what the Kennedy Farm is.

00:47:12.210 --> 00:47:16.420
But you will because that's
where John Brown and 22 men holed

00:47:16.420 --> 00:47:18.190
up before the raid
on Harper's Ferry.

00:47:18.190 --> 00:47:19.810
They were there for three months.

00:47:19.810 --> 00:47:24.170
So I think that Polly Yarrow
probably knew that John Brown --

00:47:24.170 --> 00:47:27.760
knew that there was something
going on there at the Kennedy Farm

00:47:27.760 --> 00:47:29.510
because it was only a
mile from her house.

00:47:29.510 --> 00:47:30.810
And she was the midwife,

00:47:30.810 --> 00:47:32.440
and midwives did more
than deliver babies.

00:47:32.440 --> 00:47:34.900
They were sort of first-echelon
nurses.

00:47:34.900 --> 00:47:37.930
And so they may have called on her.

00:47:40.340 --> 00:47:42.990
We move from Polly -- I'm
going to come back to Polly,

00:47:42.990 --> 00:47:46.290
but to her nephew, Simon Turner.

00:47:46.290 --> 00:47:50.150 position:56%
He was born here in a springhouse
or slave cabin on the Crampton Farm,

00:47:50.150 --> 00:47:53.530
near Crampton's Gap,
near Yarrowsburg.

00:47:53.530 --> 00:47:58.140
And then the story starts getting
better because I get better records

00:47:58.140 --> 00:48:03.540
because in 1864, Simon
Turner joined the Union army.

00:48:03.540 --> 00:48:07.730
And his wife later applied for a
pension and said this about it:

00:48:07.730 --> 00:48:09.810
"My husband Simon Turner
and I were both slaves

00:48:09.810 --> 00:48:11.110
at the time we were married.

00:48:11.110 --> 00:48:15.210 position:56%
My husband belonged to Eli Crampton,
and I belonged to Mr. John Gray.

00:48:15.210 --> 00:48:17.290
Both our masters in
slavery are dead.

00:48:17.290 --> 00:48:19.350
They were coming around
drafting men,

00:48:19.350 --> 00:48:23.500
and he [Simon] said he wanted not
to be drafted, and so he enlisted.

00:48:23.500 --> 00:48:27.550
I did not see my husband from the
time he enlisted in March 1864

00:48:27.550 --> 00:48:32.330
until he came home
in August of 1865."

00:48:32.330 --> 00:48:35.290
There's only one picture
of the unit he joined,

00:48:35.290 --> 00:48:37.280
The 39th Regiment U.S. Color Troop.

00:48:37.280 --> 00:48:38.650
This is that picture.

00:48:38.650 --> 00:48:41.000
Naturally the white
officers are in the front,

00:48:41.000 --> 00:48:44.130
but there are troopers in the back.

00:48:44.130 --> 00:48:48.660 position:56%
When I showed the Turner family this
photograph, they looked at the tall,

00:48:48.660 --> 00:48:50.900
skinny black man in the
background, and they said,

00:48:50.900 --> 00:48:53.270
"That looks like Uncle Mark."

00:48:53.270 --> 00:48:57.480
He does. I saw a picture of
Uncle Mark, but I can't be sure.

00:48:57.480 --> 00:49:00.070
Anyhow, I may have a
picture of Simon Turner.

00:49:00.070 --> 00:49:06.660
After the war, he settled here
in Pleasant Valley, Maryland.

00:49:06.660 --> 00:49:10.360
And up at the top of this
picture, it's hard for you to see,

00:49:10.360 --> 00:49:13.770
but there's marked,
"Mrs. Yarrow's house."

00:49:13.770 --> 00:49:18.760
She was famous enough for her
house to be marked on an 1877 map.

00:49:18.760 --> 00:49:23.600
And Simon Turner was living with
his father-in-law, Arthur Sands,

00:49:23.600 --> 00:49:26.540
who's marked on the map, and it's
only about a half a mile apart.

00:49:26.540 --> 00:49:28.010
So they knew each other.

00:49:28.010 --> 00:49:30.820
And then Polly died.

00:49:30.820 --> 00:49:32.660
"An old colored woman
named Polly Yarrow,

00:49:32.660 --> 00:49:35.780
whose exact age was not
known, but was over 100 years,

00:49:35.780 --> 00:49:38.620
died on last Saturday in the little
village called Yarrowsburg near

00:49:38.620 --> 00:49:42.320
Crampton's Gap and Pleasant
Valley in this county."

00:49:42.320 --> 00:49:44.130
Second black person in this family

00:49:44.130 --> 00:49:46.940
to have an obituary
in a white newspaper.

00:49:46.940 --> 00:49:50.710
These people, this was
in a period of slavery.

00:49:50.710 --> 00:49:54.910
These people were so talented
that they are being recognized,

00:49:54.910 --> 00:49:58.970
albeit at their death, with
obituaries in white newspapers.

00:50:01.430 --> 00:50:06.160
And nearing the end, we have
Simon's daughter, Emma Turner.

00:50:06.160 --> 00:50:07.500
I don't deal with all the family,

00:50:07.500 --> 00:50:10.580
only Emma because she
was a very bright girl,

00:50:10.580 --> 00:50:16.650
and she grew up in Pleasant
Valley and then went to college

00:50:16.650 --> 00:50:18.410
over here in Harper's Ferry.

00:50:18.410 --> 00:50:20.960
That's Harper's Ferry,
where John Brown was.

00:50:20.960 --> 00:50:24.520
And [inaudible] College, and
she got a degree in education.

00:50:24.520 --> 00:50:29.550 position:56%
The first one in her family to get a
college degree, at least in America.

00:50:29.550 --> 00:50:32.540
And she married a man from
Howard named Robert Ford,

00:50:32.540 --> 00:50:34.290
who was a divinity student.

00:50:34.290 --> 00:50:36.600
And they moved around
a lot, but ultimately,

00:50:36.600 --> 00:50:38.440
they settled in Baltimore.

00:50:38.440 --> 00:50:40.880
And here's Emma.

00:50:40.880 --> 00:50:44.030
She dies in 1956, so
I've got a picture.

00:50:44.030 --> 00:50:47.340
This woman, by the
way, knew Polly Yarrow.

00:50:47.340 --> 00:50:50.880
She knew Yarrow Mamout's
daughter-in-law

00:50:50.880 --> 00:50:53.500
because she was ten years old when
Polly died, and she was living

00:50:53.500 --> 00:50:56.150
in that -- a half-mile away.

00:50:56.150 --> 00:51:01.640
Anyway, they had a son, and one
of their sons, Robert Turner Ford.

00:51:01.640 --> 00:51:09.370
And in 1923, Robert Turner
Ford, her son, went to Harvard.

00:51:09.370 --> 00:51:13.460
You know, it was a different
Harvard then than it was today.

00:51:13.460 --> 00:51:15.130
There wasn't Affirmative Action.

00:51:15.130 --> 00:51:17.110
Blacks had to be ten
times more talented

00:51:17.110 --> 00:51:18.980
than white people to
get into Harvard.

00:51:18.980 --> 00:51:22.560
And in 1984, this man
went back to Harvard

00:51:22.560 --> 00:51:25.870 position:56%
and described what it was like then.

00:51:25.870 --> 00:51:28.610
There were only seven other
blacks that -- six other blacks.

00:51:28.610 --> 00:51:30.690
"In the black segment of
the segregated society

00:51:30.690 --> 00:51:33.450
in which I was born and
bred, there was an almost --

00:51:33.450 --> 00:51:35.870
almost [inaudible] faith
in education as a means

00:51:35.870 --> 00:51:38.840
of attaining social worth
and economic freedom.

00:51:38.840 --> 00:51:41.930
College graduates were
rare in that society."

00:51:41.930 --> 00:51:45.870
His grandfather and three of
his uncles had been slaves.

00:51:45.870 --> 00:51:47.830
And he's saying college
graduates are rare.

00:51:47.830 --> 00:51:49.420
And they were illiterate.

00:51:49.420 --> 00:51:52.710
"College graduates were rare,
and the possession of a diploma

00:51:52.710 --> 00:51:55.900
of any kind identified one as being
a member of an elite group entitled

00:51:55.900 --> 00:51:57.280
in leadership and respect.

00:51:57.280 --> 00:51:59.410
A graduate of Harvard
with all of its traditions

00:51:59.410 --> 00:52:01.130
and history was viewed
as the epitome

00:52:01.130 --> 00:52:03.010
of academic and social merit."

00:52:03.010 --> 00:52:05.950
This is by a man, again, whose --

00:52:05.950 --> 00:52:08.360
came out of slavery
and went to Harvard.

00:52:08.360 --> 00:52:11.240
Graduated in 1927.

00:52:11.240 --> 00:52:13.080
My research took me to Yarrowsburg.

00:52:13.080 --> 00:52:15.590
This is Mt. Moriah
Baptist Church there,

00:52:15.590 --> 00:52:18.240
and in the cemetery is
the grave of Simon Turner.

00:52:18.240 --> 00:52:21.070
It says, "He died to
save the Union."

00:52:21.070 --> 00:52:24.890
And so I've led you
through the family,

00:52:24.890 --> 00:52:27.750
and this is the chronology
I've talked through.

00:52:27.750 --> 00:52:31.190
It switches from Yarrow's
family to in-laws,

00:52:31.190 --> 00:52:33.380
but the Turners were in-laws.

00:52:33.380 --> 00:52:35.950
And this is them when I was
interviewing them for the book.

00:52:35.950 --> 00:52:41.590
The woman on the left in the red
sweater is Alice Turner Truitt

00:52:41.590 --> 00:52:46.330
who is Robert Turner's daughter,
Robert Turner Ford's daughter.

00:52:46.330 --> 00:52:49.890
These other women are her cousins.

00:52:49.890 --> 00:52:55.540
And then last summer over at
Yarrow's property in Georgetown,

00:52:55.540 --> 00:52:58.570
I got the city of Washington
to dig, archeology there.

00:52:58.570 --> 00:53:01.350
And here's the work -- the
woman sitting in the lawn chair

00:53:01.350 --> 00:53:04.070
over these is Alice
Turner and her daughter,

00:53:04.070 --> 00:53:07.590
and these are the archaeologists
working.

00:53:07.590 --> 00:53:10.880
And when they did this,
this is the panorama.

00:53:10.880 --> 00:53:13.550 position:56%
The red soil you can see all around,

00:53:13.550 --> 00:53:16.660
that is soil from Yarrow's
time period.

00:53:16.660 --> 00:53:19.460
So far, they have nothing
-- they found nothing.

00:53:19.460 --> 00:53:21.840
They bagged it all up
and looked through it.

00:53:21.840 --> 00:53:24.340
As of the last time I've talked
to them, they've found nothing

00:53:24.340 --> 00:53:27.270
that they can write to him,
but they do have things,

00:53:27.270 --> 00:53:29.370
a lot of things from
his time period.

00:53:29.370 --> 00:53:34.300
It took me about an hour
to get through this.

00:53:34.300 --> 00:53:37.430
It took them 175 years to go
from slave ship to Harvard.

00:53:37.430 --> 00:53:39.230
Thank you very much.

00:53:39.230 --> 00:53:43.220
[ Applause ]

00:53:43.220 --> 00:53:45.470 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Ellen Terrell: If anybody has any
questions, we have a few minutes.

00:53:45.470 --> 00:53:47.460
I don't know if the
books are still for sale,

00:53:47.460 --> 00:53:50.270
but he will be signing
anybody who has them.

00:53:50.270 --> 00:53:51.570 position:56%
&gt;&gt; James H. Johnston: Any questions?

00:53:51.570 --> 00:53:52.870
Yes, sir?

00:53:52.870 --> 00:53:54.810
&gt;&gt; Was Yarrow Mamout
sold into slavery

00:53:54.810 --> 00:53:57.710
because the Fulani lost a battle?

00:53:57.710 --> 00:53:59.780
How did he end up a slave?

00:53:59.780 --> 00:54:01.610
&gt;&gt; James H. Johnston:
I don't know exactly.

00:54:01.610 --> 00:54:08.190
I do know Ayuba Suleiman
Diallo, who was another Fulani,

00:54:08.190 --> 00:54:11.500
he made the mistake of
sleeping in the wrong hut.

00:54:11.500 --> 00:54:15.820
And the Mandingo came by, and
they were the enemy of Fulani,

00:54:15.820 --> 00:54:17.990
captured him, and sold
his to slave ships.

00:54:17.990 --> 00:54:19.360
So I think that Yarrow

00:54:19.360 --> 00:54:23.450
and his sister probably got
captured somehow the same.

00:54:23.450 --> 00:54:26.080
But it's an assumption.

00:54:26.080 --> 00:54:27.380
Yes?

00:54:27.380 --> 00:54:28.680
&gt;&gt; [Inaudible].

00:54:28.680 --> 00:54:34.310
And I wondered if there
was a good reason for that.

00:54:34.310 --> 00:54:35.750
&gt;&gt; James H. Johnston: There's
not a reason to skip over it.

00:54:35.750 --> 00:54:40.430
It's just that it doesn't -- it
doesn't flow with the lecture.

00:54:40.430 --> 00:54:42.930
He's dealt with in the
book a lot, but it just --

00:54:42.930 --> 00:54:46.610
you know, it didn't flow
with what I was saying.

00:54:46.610 --> 00:54:47.910
Other questions?

00:54:47.910 --> 00:54:49.210
Yes, ma'am.

00:54:49.210 --> 00:54:53.960
&gt;&gt; Just a respectful request, and
I mean that absolutely sincerely.

00:54:53.960 --> 00:54:58.510
When you speak of Yarrow and
other Fulani who could read

00:54:58.510 --> 00:55:02.390
and write Arabic as
"educated," isn't it fair to say

00:55:02.390 --> 00:55:06.470
that there were many others
who were pulled into slavery

00:55:06.470 --> 00:55:10.310
who were educated and
sometimes very deeply

00:55:10.310 --> 00:55:11.730
in [inaudible] of their society?

00:55:11.730 --> 00:55:13.620
They just didn't read
and write because reading

00:55:13.620 --> 00:55:15.770
and writing weren't
part of their cultures.

00:55:15.770 --> 00:55:17.840
But that doesn't mean that
they weren't educated.

00:55:17.840 --> 00:55:20.660
Wouldn't it perhaps be better to
speak of "literate" as opposed

00:55:20.660 --> 00:55:22.180
to "educated" when you talk --

00:55:22.180 --> 00:55:24.730
&gt;&gt; James H. Johnston: Well, but
the Fulani had formal education.

00:55:24.730 --> 00:55:26.080
They would have had schools

00:55:26.080 --> 00:55:31.960
which the non-Muslim Africans
did not have a school system.

00:55:31.960 --> 00:55:33.260
&gt;&gt; Well, that's not entirely true.

00:55:33.260 --> 00:55:36.960
They did have ways of educating
people when they came of age

00:55:36.960 --> 00:55:39.030
at various stages of their life.

00:55:39.030 --> 00:55:42.260
They would have intensive
education in their traditions.

00:55:42.260 --> 00:55:44.600
They just didn't -- they
didn't have a written culture.

00:55:44.600 --> 00:55:45.900
But I don't want to say

00:55:45.900 --> 00:55:48.220
if you couldn't write,
you weren't educated.

00:55:48.220 --> 00:55:50.080
That's the only point I'm making.

00:55:50.080 --> 00:55:51.380
&gt;&gt; James H. Johnston: No, I agree.

00:55:51.380 --> 00:55:52.680
I agree with you.

00:55:52.680 --> 00:55:54.640
But -- and I try to
make that distinction.

00:55:54.640 --> 00:55:58.480
Except for the fact that the
Fulani could read and write.

00:55:58.480 --> 00:56:02.040
And therefore, when
they came to America,

00:56:02.040 --> 00:56:05.150
they were treated quite a bit
differently probably because 95%

00:56:05.150 --> 00:56:07.660
of white Americans could
not read and write.

00:56:07.660 --> 00:56:12.060
So suddenly to see a black man who
actually knew more than, you know,

00:56:12.060 --> 00:56:15.430
seemed more educated than you
were was really quite disquieting

00:56:15.430 --> 00:56:16.730
for white Americans.

00:56:16.730 --> 00:56:19.370
And a matter of respect
for them, too.

00:56:19.370 --> 00:56:20.670
Yes, sir?

00:56:20.670 --> 00:56:25.070
&gt;&gt; I mean, the title
"From Slave Ship

00:56:25.070 --> 00:56:27.040
to Harvard" is certainly
interesting,

00:56:27.040 --> 00:56:31.110
in the sense that I'm sure you must
have read the book from [inaudible]

00:56:31.110 --> 00:56:33.770
which he shows how, you know,

00:56:33.770 --> 00:56:39.100
a lot of the elite universities
were fundamentally funded,

00:56:39.100 --> 00:56:43.200 position:56%
created largely by, you know, by
the slave trade and stuff like that.

00:56:43.200 --> 00:56:46.050
So to go back to the
grandson or something

00:56:46.050 --> 00:56:48.840
like that who went to Harvard --

00:56:48.840 --> 00:56:50.140
&gt;&gt; James H. Johnston:
It's five generations.

00:56:50.140 --> 00:56:54.340
&gt;&gt; But you should want to say
be saying about, you know,

00:56:54.340 --> 00:56:55.640
about education being [inaudible].

00:56:55.640 --> 00:56:59.280
Did he ever in his
writings talk about --

00:56:59.280 --> 00:57:06.980
he must have encountered incredible
racism while he was at Harvard,

00:57:06.980 --> 00:57:08.280
and obviously [inaudible].

00:57:08.280 --> 00:57:10.730
So did he write about that?

00:57:10.730 --> 00:57:12.340
Did he talk about that?

00:57:12.340 --> 00:57:16.950
Did that cause him to consider
any aspects of his education

00:57:16.950 --> 00:57:18.480
that he had gotten there?

00:57:18.480 --> 00:57:22.160
And talk [inaudible]
and stuff like that?

00:57:22.160 --> 00:57:25.650
&gt;&gt; James H. Johnston: The
question is did Robert Turner Ford,

00:57:25.650 --> 00:57:29.830
who went to Harvard, write or
talk about the racism at Harvard?

00:57:29.830 --> 00:57:31.400
And the answer's no.

00:57:31.400 --> 00:57:36.270
It was the old black
culture, I think in America.

00:57:36.270 --> 00:57:38.860
He thought he was lucky
to get there.

00:57:38.860 --> 00:57:44.010
And he did not reflect
on his adversity,

00:57:44.010 --> 00:57:47.510 position:56%
although in his reunion speech --
of course he was talking to Harvard.

00:57:47.510 --> 00:57:50.170
The only thing I have from him
is that writing, and he's talking

00:57:50.170 --> 00:57:53.330
to his Harvard classmates,
so he clearly, I think,

00:57:53.330 --> 00:57:55.190
did not want to complain.

00:57:55.190 --> 00:57:59.540
I know from the family that he
obviously experienced racism,

00:57:59.540 --> 00:58:04.210
and felt very strongly about racial
justice, and the family does.

00:58:04.210 --> 00:58:07.010
But he did not express it
in that speech at Harvard.

00:58:07.010 --> 00:58:09.510
Yes, sir.

00:58:09.510 --> 00:58:32.080
[ Inaudible ]

&gt;&gt; James H. Johnston:
You lived in Debt Place?

00:58:33.380 --> 00:58:35.170
Where did you live on Debt Place?

00:58:35.170 --> 00:58:36.880
&gt;&gt; I don't -- I forget the --

00:58:36.880 --> 00:58:38.180
&gt;&gt; James H. Johnston: Okay.

00:58:38.180 --> 00:58:41.050
&gt;&gt; But I lived on Debt Place.

00:58:41.050 --> 00:58:42.890
&gt;&gt; James H. Johnston: Yeah, I mean
that was not the best part of town.

00:58:42.890 --> 00:58:46.350
John Kennedy lived across the
street when he was first married.

00:58:46.350 --> 00:58:48.770
He and Jacqueline Kennedy
lived across the street

00:58:48.770 --> 00:58:53.290 position:56%
from Yarrow's old property, but they
never apparently realized it was

00:58:53.290 --> 00:58:56.450
such historic property.

00:58:56.450 --> 00:58:58.490
Any other -- one more
question, and then --

00:58:58.490 --> 00:59:07.190
&gt;&gt; In looking at the way that
you -- I'm a genealogist, okay,

00:59:07.190 --> 00:59:11.400
so I'm fascinated by
your whole process.

00:59:11.400 --> 00:59:16.500
And the way that you were able

00:59:16.500 --> 00:59:25.030
to track the family
over time and in place.

00:59:25.030 --> 00:59:30.500
In terms of the records that you
were finding, was that family --

00:59:30.500 --> 00:59:32.270
did they stick out in the records?

00:59:32.270 --> 00:59:41.090
In terms of African Americans,
or was there a larger community?

00:59:41.090 --> 00:59:43.980
In other words, were
they the prominent family

00:59:43.980 --> 00:59:46.340
that you were finding
in the records?

00:59:46.340 --> 00:59:49.430
&gt;&gt; James H. Johnston: the question
is was this family prominent

00:59:49.430 --> 00:59:55.120
in the records, and
the answer's yes.

00:59:55.120 --> 00:59:57.240
When I -- throughout
all my research,

00:59:57.240 --> 01:00:03.050
it was clear that this
family, whether it was Yarrow

01:00:03.050 --> 01:00:07.100
or his in-laws were
very exceptional people.

01:00:07.100 --> 01:00:10.770
I could find records on them.

01:00:10.770 --> 01:00:14.560
Arthur Sands, who was one of
the ancestors, got himself --

01:00:14.560 --> 01:00:17.590
bought his own freedom in 1856.

01:00:17.590 --> 01:00:20.980
And then when Maryland passed
a law after John Brown's raid

01:00:20.980 --> 01:00:23.520
on Harper's Ferry, Maryland
passed a law to really,

01:00:23.520 --> 01:00:26.570
absolutely prohibit freedom
for blacks because, you know,

01:00:26.570 --> 01:00:29.450
John Brown had used
some free blacks.

01:00:29.450 --> 01:00:31.260
And so Maryland said, "That's it!

01:00:31.260 --> 01:00:32.960
We're never going to
let blacks free."

01:00:32.960 --> 01:00:36.650
Arthur Sands, before that law
took effect, he took $600,

01:00:36.650 --> 01:00:39.030
and bought the freedom of
his wife and his children.

01:00:39.030 --> 01:00:40.760
So he was a unique individual.

01:00:40.760 --> 01:00:43.460 position:56%
He founded the Mt. Moriah Baptist
Church, the photo that I showed you.

01:00:43.460 --> 01:00:45.150 position:56%
He founded the black school in
Pleasant Valley after the Civil War.

01:00:45.150 --> 01:00:46.650
So throughout the time these
people were very, very exceptional.

01:00:46.650 --> 01:00:48.030
And that's the story I wanted
to tell with this book.

01:00:48.030 --> 01:00:49.330
But with that, I want to
thank you all for coming.

01:00:49.330 --> 01:00:50.630
I will sign books outside,
or you can buy books.

01:00:50.630 --> 01:00:52.430
Thank you very much.
