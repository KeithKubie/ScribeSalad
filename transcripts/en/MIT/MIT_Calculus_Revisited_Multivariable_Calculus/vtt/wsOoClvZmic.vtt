00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:36.960
PROFESSOR: Hi, welcome
to Calculus Part 2,

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.450
where our theme for
the entire course

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:42.760
will essentially be functions
of several variables.

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:46.950
But a more underlying theme,
a theme which will not only

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:49.620
permeate this
course, but virtually

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:52.920
every course in the mathematics
curriculum, and perhaps

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.550
other curricula as
well, is the idea

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:58.920
of what we mean by a
mathematical structure.

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:03.350
And if this sounds a little
bit ominous and frightening,

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:05.910
the idea of a
mathematical structure

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:10.030
can be compared very
nicely in terms of a game,

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:12.180
and for this reason,
I have chosen

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:17.960
to entitle our first lesson
"The 'Game' of Mathematics".

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:19.880
"The 'Game' of Mathematics."

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:23.480
And let's emphasize
the word "game" here.

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:26.590
We do not mean game
in a trivial sense,

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:30.260
where in elementary school, the
first row races the second row

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:32.960
to see who finishes the
addition problem first.

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:36.830
The idea that we want to
talk about is what is a game.

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:38.850
And I remember an
old riddle when

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:41.810
I was in about the fourth or
fifth grade, when somebody said

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:46.000
to me: "what is it that looks
like a box, smells like cheese,

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:47.110
and flies?"

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:49.970
And the answer was
a flying cheese box.

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:51.940
And the interesting
point is that this

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:55.970
is how, in the scientific world,
we often make up definitions.

00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:59.590
Namely, to define a
game, we try to think

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:04.020
of every single ingredient
that is common to every game,

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:06.240
and then we roll all
of these ingredients

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:08.550
into one long
definition, and that

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:10.949
becomes our final definition.

00:02:10.949 --> 00:02:16.060
And with that in mind, let
me take the following tack.

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:19.890
And again, let me point out that
I am going through this rather

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:23.740
hurriedly because the
main aim of the lesson

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:26.520
is to give an
overview, with the idea

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:31.260
that the supplementary notes
and the exercises in the unit

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:34.570
will give you the computational
drill that you need.

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:38.930
But for a first approximation,
let us say that, in any game,

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:43.950
you must have definitions, so to
know what terminology you have.

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:46.650
Then you must have
rules of the game,

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:48.630
and notice that the
rules of the game

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:51.800
are relationships
between the terms.

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:54.460
Oh, as a trivial example,
in playing cards,

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:56.860
there are many
different card games

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:59.850
that can be played with
the same deck of cards.

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:04.100
What makes the game
different are not

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:07.520
the definitions involved,
but the rules of the game.

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:10.010
And finally, there
are objectives.

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:12.650
Well, obviously, the objective
of any game is to win.

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:15.300
What we really mean
by an objective

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:19.290
is the art of carrying
out a winning situation

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:24.550
by successfully employing the
definitions and the rules.

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:28.220
And the way we do that is
usually called strategy.

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:31.450
Strategy is the art of using
the definitions and rules

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:35.120
to carry out the objective
in an inescapable manner.

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:37.620
And the reason I like this
particular little setup

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:39.560
is it gives me a
way to show you,

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:44.790
in juxtaposition, the role
of rote verses reason, logic

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:48.180
verses memory, in any
mathematical situation

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:49.540
or real-life situation.

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:55.230
Namely, the strategy
part of a game is logic,

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:58.532
and things like the
definitions and the rules

00:03:58.532 --> 00:04:00.560
are things that we memorize.

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:05.820
OK, now, the thing
that we're going

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:09.770
to do, in our particular
course, is always come back

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:11.070
to this particular structure.

00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:13.700
In other words, our
definition of a game

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:17.790
is any system which consists
of definitions, rules,

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:20.940
and objectives, where the
objective is carried out

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:24.830
as an inescapable consequence
of the definitions and the rules

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:27.540
by means of strategy.

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:30.590
And by the way, don't
take this lightly.

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:32.950
This is a very serious topic.

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:35.420
Later in the course,
the computation

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:37.660
will become
sufficiently difficult

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:41.030
that we may lose sight of the
forest because of the trees.

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:44.080
Right now, what I want to
do is emphasize this to you

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:47.060
in terms of topics that
you're already familiar with,

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:49.220
so that you can see what
the overall structure

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:51.260
of mathematics is,
so that you will not

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:53.490
be preoccupied with
this when we're learning

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:55.290
more computational things.

00:04:55.290 --> 00:04:58.140
Let me just take
a look at, well,

00:04:58.140 --> 00:05:00.980
a relatively trivial example.

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:02.930
I call this a new
look at counting.

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:05.130
We all know how to count.

00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:07.390
We start with a number
called 1, and we

00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:12.400
have various definitions, 1
plus 1 is 2, 2 plus 1 is 3,

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:18.550
3 plus 1 is 4, 4 plus 1 is
5, 5 plus 1 is 6, 6 plus 1

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:20.090
is 7, et cetera.

00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:22.480
OK, so far, so good.

00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:26.940
Now, we ask the question:
"how much is 4 plus 3?"

00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:31.130
Now, obviously, we all
know that 4 plus 3 is 7.

00:05:31.130 --> 00:05:34.140
We're not saying what are we
looking at this problem for.

00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:38.030
What we're trying to show now
is a very important aspect

00:05:38.030 --> 00:05:39.620
of the game of mathematics.

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:42.570
You see, notice that in
our list of definitions,

00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:46.340
no place do we have the
sum 4 plus 3 defined.

00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:48.640
What we are interested
in, now, is not

00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:52.160
so much the truthful
statement that 4 plus 3 is 7,

00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:55.370
but whether the result
4 plus 3 equals 7

00:05:55.370 --> 00:06:00.260
follows inescapably from the
definitions that we've listed.

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:03.510
Now, you see, the point is all
we've listed are definitions.

00:06:03.510 --> 00:06:07.220
We haven't told any particular
rules of the game yet.

00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:10.620
Well, let's make up some rules
as we go along, and as I say,

00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:13.110
we'll discuss these in
more details in our notes

00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:14.960
and in the exercises.

00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:17.020
We essentially do
something like this.

00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:22.670
We write down 4 plus
3, then we say, OK, we

00:06:22.670 --> 00:06:24.940
do know how to add
by ones; that's

00:06:24.940 --> 00:06:26.400
what our definition says.

00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:29.090
So we rewrite 3 as 2 plus 1.

00:06:29.090 --> 00:06:32.990
In other words, we substitute
2 plus 1, which is equal to 3

00:06:32.990 --> 00:06:34.560
by definition.

00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:39.860
Then we say, OK, 2 plus 1
is the same as 1 plus 2.

00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:42.100
Now, by the way, notice
the tacit assumption

00:06:42.100 --> 00:06:42.950
that we're making.

00:06:42.950 --> 00:06:45.970
We're assuming that the order
in which you add two numbers

00:06:45.970 --> 00:06:47.330
makes no difference.

00:06:47.330 --> 00:06:50.430
Obviously, this is not a
rule in every game of life.

00:06:50.430 --> 00:06:53.400
In most things in life,
order does make a difference.

00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:55.360
Consider, for example,
the statements

00:06:55.360 --> 00:06:59.065
first I undress, and then I take
a shower; or first I shower,

00:06:59.065 --> 00:07:00.430
and then I undress.

00:07:00.430 --> 00:07:04.000
Without meaning to pass
judgment as to which is proper,

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.899
at least notice there is a
difference between the two.

00:07:06.899 --> 00:07:08.690
What we're saying is
that, somehow or other

00:07:08.690 --> 00:07:10.690
in the game of
arithmetic, we assume

00:07:10.690 --> 00:07:13.820
that addition has the property
that the order in which you add

00:07:13.820 --> 00:07:15.060
makes no difference.

00:07:15.060 --> 00:07:18.630
So we say, OK, let's accept
that as a rule of the game.

00:07:18.630 --> 00:07:21.200
If we accept that as a
rule the game, 2 plus 1

00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:24.880
could then be substituted
for by 1 plus 2.

00:07:24.880 --> 00:07:26.900
We make the
additional assumption

00:07:26.900 --> 00:07:28.780
that, when you
add three numbers,

00:07:28.780 --> 00:07:31.590
the answer does not depend
on voice inflection.

00:07:31.590 --> 00:07:34.610
In other words that
4 plus 1 plus 2

00:07:34.610 --> 00:07:38.400
is equal to 4 plus 1 plus 2.

00:07:38.400 --> 00:07:40.450
And the strategy
behind doing that

00:07:40.450 --> 00:07:44.070
is that we know that another
name for 4 plus 1 is 5.

00:07:44.070 --> 00:07:47.880
In other words, we now arrive
at the fact that 4 plus 3

00:07:47.880 --> 00:07:50.240
is equal to 5 plus 2.

00:07:50.240 --> 00:07:54.210
We now rewrite 2 as
1 plus 1, and we now

00:07:54.210 --> 00:07:59.340
have the 5 plus 2 is the
same as 5 plus 1 plus 1.

00:07:59.340 --> 00:08:02.110
We now again use the fact
that voice inflection

00:08:02.110 --> 00:08:05.230
makes no difference,
and we rewrite this as 5

00:08:05.230 --> 00:08:08.360
plus 1 plus 1.

00:08:08.360 --> 00:08:13.230
5 plus 1, we know by
definition, is 6, and 6 plus 1,

00:08:13.230 --> 00:08:16.190
we know by definition, is seven.

00:08:16.190 --> 00:08:19.920
In other words, subject to the
rules that we've talked about

00:08:19.920 --> 00:08:23.400
implicitly here but have not
stated in our game format

00:08:23.400 --> 00:08:26.560
explicitly, what
we have shown is

00:08:26.560 --> 00:08:32.299
that if we accept certain rules,
it follows from our definitions

00:08:32.299 --> 00:08:36.690
that 4 plus 3 equals 7 is
an inescapable conclusion.

00:08:36.690 --> 00:08:39.679
Notice that the inescapability
of the conclusion

00:08:39.679 --> 00:08:44.350
hinges on the fact that
we've accepted certain rules.

00:08:44.350 --> 00:08:47.840
If we change the rules, we
can change the conclusions.

00:08:47.840 --> 00:08:49.800
In other words,
this thing called

00:08:49.800 --> 00:08:54.000
drawing inescapable conclusions
is something called validity,

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:58.490
and validity involves the art of
drawing inescapable conclusions

00:08:58.490 --> 00:09:02.010
using given rules and
given definitions.

00:09:02.010 --> 00:09:04.500
We'll talk about
that in more detail,

00:09:04.500 --> 00:09:07.380
but for now, notice
the difference here.

00:09:07.380 --> 00:09:13.470
Before we did this, we knew as
a conjecture, a past experience

00:09:13.470 --> 00:09:17.150
thing, that 4 plus 3 equals
7 is a true statement.

00:09:17.150 --> 00:09:21.310
What we now know is in terms
of certain rules of the game,

00:09:21.310 --> 00:09:25.020
coupled with the definitions
that we've accepted, 4 plus 3

00:09:25.020 --> 00:09:29.160
equals 7 is an inescapable
conclusion, henceforth to be

00:09:29.160 --> 00:09:32.250
called a "theorem" in our game.

00:09:32.250 --> 00:09:35.250
Let's see if we can't get
away from this rather simple

00:09:35.250 --> 00:09:38.180
example, and again, let me
emphasize that as simple

00:09:38.180 --> 00:09:40.860
as this example is,
throughout our course,

00:09:40.860 --> 00:09:44.050
we will be using the
same technique, only

00:09:44.050 --> 00:09:48.080
at a more sophisticated
level of computational skill.

00:09:48.080 --> 00:09:52.040
But let's take a look here and
see what we're really saying.

00:09:52.040 --> 00:09:56.310
What mathematical
structure really involves

00:09:56.310 --> 00:09:59.200
is a logic machine
type of thing.

00:09:59.200 --> 00:10:02.280
We have a logic
machine, a machine

00:10:02.280 --> 00:10:06.150
that, being fed any kinds
of definitions, rules,

00:10:06.150 --> 00:10:12.340
assumptions, et cetera, grinds
these things through and has,

00:10:12.340 --> 00:10:16.450
as its output,
inescapable conclusions.

00:10:16.450 --> 00:10:20.570
In other words, you feed in
definitions, rules, et cetera,

00:10:20.570 --> 00:10:23.070
which by the way,
don't really have

00:10:23.070 --> 00:10:26.150
to be true in the real-life
sense of being true.

00:10:26.150 --> 00:10:28.030
I mean, for example,
in the baseball game,

00:10:28.030 --> 00:10:30.120
to say the rule is
three strikes is an out,

00:10:30.120 --> 00:10:32.190
there was certainly
no basic truth

00:10:32.190 --> 00:10:34.000
the said that had
to be the case.

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:37.350
What is true is that,
in the world of science,

00:10:37.350 --> 00:10:39.600
the scientist is the
interpreter of nature.

00:10:39.600 --> 00:10:43.770
What happens in real life
happens whether the scientist

00:10:43.770 --> 00:10:44.740
predicts it or not.

00:10:44.740 --> 00:10:48.720
What he tries to do is to make
up definitions and rules, which

00:10:48.720 --> 00:10:51.710
are compatible with
his experience, things

00:10:51.710 --> 00:10:53.640
which he calls truth.

00:10:53.640 --> 00:10:56.650
He feeds those through
his logic machine,

00:10:56.650 --> 00:11:02.150
draws inescapable conclusions,
and if the conclusions

00:11:02.150 --> 00:11:05.750
follow inescapably from the
definitions and the rules,

00:11:05.750 --> 00:11:09.200
we call the resulting
argument valid.

00:11:09.200 --> 00:11:12.430
In other words, truth
is a value judgment

00:11:12.430 --> 00:11:14.940
that we make about a
particular statement.

00:11:14.940 --> 00:11:17.940
Validity is a more
objective thing

00:11:17.940 --> 00:11:20.030
that we attribute
to an argument.

00:11:20.030 --> 00:11:23.080
In other words, a statement
is either true or false.

00:11:23.080 --> 00:11:26.030
An argument is either
valid or invalid,

00:11:26.030 --> 00:11:29.040
meaning that we only judge
whether the conclusion

00:11:29.040 --> 00:11:31.760
of the argument follows
inescapably from the given

00:11:31.760 --> 00:11:35.030
assumptions, independently
of whether those assumptions

00:11:35.030 --> 00:11:37.090
happen to be true or not.

00:11:37.090 --> 00:11:40.030
By the way, as an aside,
one of the reasons

00:11:40.030 --> 00:11:43.790
that the scientist
prefers to dodge issues

00:11:43.790 --> 00:11:48.160
such as "what is truth" and
leaves that to the philosopher,

00:11:48.160 --> 00:11:51.210
is that truth, in many
cases, is a relative thing.

00:11:51.210 --> 00:11:53.670
It's based on the
available knowledge.

00:11:53.670 --> 00:11:57.070
It's also based on the situation
that we want to handle.

00:11:57.070 --> 00:12:00.200
In other words, what is truth?

00:12:00.200 --> 00:12:04.130
And my claim is that the answer
depends on the situation.

00:12:04.130 --> 00:12:07.970
Well, let me give you again a
trivial arithmetic situation.

00:12:07.970 --> 00:12:15.100
Does 1/2 plus 1/3 equal 5/6,
or does 1/2 plus 1/3 equal 2/5?

00:12:15.100 --> 00:12:19.050
And again, the
answer is it depends

00:12:19.050 --> 00:12:22.050
on what real-life problem
you're dealing with.

00:12:22.050 --> 00:12:26.150
For example, if a person is
working for you by the hour,

00:12:26.150 --> 00:12:29.460
and he works for you
for a half hour one day

00:12:29.460 --> 00:12:33.250
and a third of an hour the next
day, the total time he's worked

00:12:33.250 --> 00:12:34.740
is 5/6 of an hour.

00:12:34.740 --> 00:12:35.290
Why?

00:12:35.290 --> 00:12:37.960
Because this agrees with
our real-life experience

00:12:37.960 --> 00:12:42.830
that 30 minutes plus 20
minutes is 50 minutes.

00:12:42.830 --> 00:12:45.420
On the other hand,
if a baseball player

00:12:45.420 --> 00:12:48.130
goes one for two in the
first game of a doubleheader

00:12:48.130 --> 00:12:51.690
and one for three in the
second game of a doubleheader,

00:12:51.690 --> 00:12:55.730
he has batted two hits
in five times at bat.

00:12:55.730 --> 00:12:57.830
In fact, if you could
convince the public

00:12:57.830 --> 00:13:00.300
that he had five hits
and six times at bat,

00:13:00.300 --> 00:13:04.110
you could become a director
of any economy program

00:13:04.110 --> 00:13:05.550
in the nation, I guess.

00:13:05.550 --> 00:13:07.340
The point, however, is this.

00:13:07.340 --> 00:13:10.390
In most arithmetic
questions that we deal with,

00:13:10.390 --> 00:13:12.930
we are used to the
physical interpretation

00:13:12.930 --> 00:13:17.680
in which 1/2 plus 1/3 equals
5/6 reflects the real life

00:13:17.680 --> 00:13:18.700
situation.

00:13:18.700 --> 00:13:22.060
Whereas this example here
may seem trivial, namely,

00:13:22.060 --> 00:13:25.390
how often are you going to be
involved with batting averages

00:13:25.390 --> 00:13:27.730
unless you're doing
sixth grade arithmetic.

00:13:27.730 --> 00:13:31.520
The point remains, ironically
or whatever you want to call it,

00:13:31.520 --> 00:13:34.950
that this little batting
average problem is not trivial.

00:13:34.950 --> 00:13:38.090
In the world of engineering,
we know this example

00:13:38.090 --> 00:13:40.820
as the weighted average problem.

00:13:40.820 --> 00:13:44.940
In other words, you'll notice
that 2 over 5, as a fraction,

00:13:44.940 --> 00:13:49.750
is more nearly equal to 1/3
that it is equal to 1/2,

00:13:49.750 --> 00:13:53.250
and the reason for that
is that the player batted

00:13:53.250 --> 00:13:56.480
at the low average, 1 over
3, one hit in three times

00:13:56.480 --> 00:13:58.590
at bat, for more times at bat.

00:13:58.590 --> 00:14:01.840
In other words, the three has
a heavier weighting factor

00:14:01.840 --> 00:14:05.810
than the two, and every time
that you use a weighted average

00:14:05.810 --> 00:14:09.170
in a scientific engineering
oriented investigation,

00:14:09.170 --> 00:14:12.460
this is the truth, not this.

00:14:12.460 --> 00:14:16.690
In other words, it is neither
true or false that 1/2 plus 1/3

00:14:16.690 --> 00:14:20.540
equals 2/5 or that 1/2
plus 1/3 equals 5/6.

00:14:20.540 --> 00:14:24.644
Which is true depends on the
particular physical situation.

00:14:24.644 --> 00:14:26.310
You see a rather
interesting point here,

00:14:26.310 --> 00:14:28.620
that we sometimes
allow truth to be

00:14:28.620 --> 00:14:32.420
based on what particular
problem we're trying to solve.

00:14:32.420 --> 00:14:35.120
Another way that
we manipulate truth

00:14:35.120 --> 00:14:38.760
is that we sometimes have a
rule that we like to be true.

00:14:38.760 --> 00:14:40.420
In fact, I guess
this is probably

00:14:40.420 --> 00:14:43.680
what happens with most
political theories

00:14:43.680 --> 00:14:45.740
that one starts
with the objectives,

00:14:45.740 --> 00:14:48.080
knows what it is that
he wants to be true,

00:14:48.080 --> 00:14:50.590
and then invents the
definitions and the rules

00:14:50.590 --> 00:14:52.350
to conform with this.

00:14:52.350 --> 00:14:55.160
In much the same way as
around the fourth grade again,

00:14:55.160 --> 00:14:58.490
we learn such adages as
"Look before you leap,"

00:14:58.490 --> 00:15:02.030
and two minutes later you learn
"He who hesitates is lost,"

00:15:02.030 --> 00:15:04.240
and suddenly you come
to the conclusion

00:15:04.240 --> 00:15:07.950
that you can make your
assumptions validify

00:15:07.950 --> 00:15:11.130
any conclusion you want just
by choosing your assumptions

00:15:11.130 --> 00:15:12.180
appropriately.

00:15:12.180 --> 00:15:14.140
Now, if that sounds
degrading, let

00:15:14.140 --> 00:15:18.730
me show you how it's used
effectively in mathematics.

00:15:18.730 --> 00:15:22.110
In other words, let me just say
that predetermined rules may

00:15:22.110 --> 00:15:23.480
control truth.

00:15:23.480 --> 00:15:25.460
Let me give you an example.

00:15:25.460 --> 00:15:30.620
Going back to exponents,
why does b to the 0 equal 1?

00:15:30.620 --> 00:15:33.570
The answer is very
simple, that when

00:15:33.570 --> 00:15:37.810
we use positive exponents,
positive whole number

00:15:37.810 --> 00:15:42.810
exponents, we talked about
that many factors of b.

00:15:42.810 --> 00:15:45.140
And one of the
interesting rules that we

00:15:45.140 --> 00:15:48.540
saw that was obeyed by
whole number exponents

00:15:48.540 --> 00:15:51.490
was that if you multiply
b to the m-th power

00:15:51.490 --> 00:15:55.000
by b to the n-th power,
you got as an answer b

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:59.650
to the m plus n power.

00:15:59.650 --> 00:16:01.390
b to the m plus n.

00:16:01.390 --> 00:16:06.360
Now, the interesting thing
is that after a while,

00:16:06.360 --> 00:16:10.440
you never even paid attention
to why this rule worked.

00:16:10.440 --> 00:16:13.680
What you did know was that
this was a pretty darn

00:16:13.680 --> 00:16:15.600
convenient rule to use.

00:16:15.600 --> 00:16:18.630
Computationally,
this rule simplified

00:16:18.630 --> 00:16:23.380
many particular computations
that you were doing.

00:16:23.380 --> 00:16:27.460
In particular, then,
as soon as n is 0,

00:16:27.460 --> 00:16:30.130
you would still like to
be able to use this rule.

00:16:30.130 --> 00:16:33.120
In other words, we
want this nice rule

00:16:33.120 --> 00:16:36.430
to apply even when n equals 0.

00:16:36.430 --> 00:16:39.810
Now, let's look at this from
a computational point of view.

00:16:39.810 --> 00:16:45.190
If we want this rule to
apply when n equals 0,

00:16:45.190 --> 00:16:48.160
let's simply
rewrite this exactly

00:16:48.160 --> 00:16:53.190
as it appears here
with n equal to 0.

00:16:53.190 --> 00:16:55.820
We then have, what?

00:16:55.820 --> 00:16:58.600
We have b-- we'll just
repeat everything here.

00:16:58.600 --> 00:17:01.860
b to the m times b.

00:17:01.860 --> 00:17:06.079
Now, we're replacing n by
0, so that's b to the 0,

00:17:06.079 --> 00:17:15.390
and that must equal b to the
m plus n, that's m plus 0.

00:17:15.390 --> 00:17:17.990
But the interesting
point is that we

00:17:17.990 --> 00:17:23.089
know how to add numbers, and
for numbers, m plus 0 is m.

00:17:23.089 --> 00:17:26.849
In other words, this
is still b to the m.

00:17:26.849 --> 00:17:30.560
Now, we look at this,
and what we're saying

00:17:30.560 --> 00:17:36.090
is if we want the rule b
to the m times b to the n

00:17:36.090 --> 00:17:40.710
to equal b to the m plus n
to be true even when n is 0,

00:17:40.710 --> 00:17:44.730
this says that b to the 0
must be that number such

00:17:44.730 --> 00:17:49.340
that when we multiply it by b
to the m, we get b to the m.

00:17:49.340 --> 00:17:51.770
Now, what number
has the property

00:17:51.770 --> 00:17:55.940
that when you multiply it by
b to the m you get b to the m?

00:17:55.940 --> 00:17:58.300
And if you're real
quick, you say 1,

00:17:58.300 --> 00:17:59.970
and if you're
algebra-oriented, you

00:17:59.970 --> 00:18:05.110
say b to the 0 is therefore
equal b to the m divided

00:18:05.110 --> 00:18:08.980
by b to the m, and
again you say 1,

00:18:08.980 --> 00:18:12.890
except of course that b must
be unequal to zero because,

00:18:12.890 --> 00:18:15.910
hopefully, by this time we
understand why we must never

00:18:15.910 --> 00:18:18.100
divide by 0.

00:18:18.100 --> 00:18:20.900
In other words, what we now
have is the old high school

00:18:20.900 --> 00:18:30.700
rule that b to the 0 equals
1 provided b is unequal to 0.

00:18:30.700 --> 00:18:32.600
But here's the important point.

00:18:32.600 --> 00:18:35.120
If I have never
defined b to the 0,

00:18:35.120 --> 00:18:36.880
and somebody says
to me: "make up

00:18:36.880 --> 00:18:40.540
a definition for b to the
0," and I say, OK, b to the 0

00:18:40.540 --> 00:18:44.350
is going to be 36, I have
every right in the world

00:18:44.350 --> 00:18:45.770
to make up that definition.

00:18:45.770 --> 00:18:48.450
What I don't have
a right to do is,

00:18:48.450 --> 00:18:51.420
when I'm ever using an
expression like b to the 0,

00:18:51.420 --> 00:18:53.780
is to assume that
I have the right

00:18:53.780 --> 00:18:56.030
to use this particular recipe.

00:18:56.030 --> 00:19:00.040
In other words, if I want to
be able to use the nice recipe,

00:19:00.040 --> 00:19:05.290
even when n is 0, I have no
choice but to define b to the 0

00:19:05.290 --> 00:19:06.840
to equal 1.

00:19:06.840 --> 00:19:08.990
Therefore, we make
up that definition

00:19:08.990 --> 00:19:11.820
because we want that
recipe to apply,

00:19:11.820 --> 00:19:14.050
and that's exactly what
we're going to be doing

00:19:14.050 --> 00:19:15.420
through most of this course.

00:19:15.420 --> 00:19:18.310
We are going to look at
certain real-life situations,

00:19:18.310 --> 00:19:21.610
we are going to look at certain
recipes that we want to apply,

00:19:21.610 --> 00:19:23.980
and we are going to make
up definitions this way,

00:19:23.980 --> 00:19:28.100
and then see how our
inescapable conclusions follow

00:19:28.100 --> 00:19:29.760
from these definitions.

00:19:29.760 --> 00:19:33.870
More about that will be said
in the remainder of this unit,

00:19:33.870 --> 00:19:35.770
and our next
lecture will pick up

00:19:35.770 --> 00:19:38.450
the game of mathematics
in a different context.

00:19:38.450 --> 00:19:40.300
But until next time, good bye.
