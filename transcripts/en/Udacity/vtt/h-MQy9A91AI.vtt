00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
All right. Unit 4 homework time.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.000
We are going to be adding user accounts, and there is going to be three parts to this..

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000
The first part is going to be registration with a valid cookie.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:17.000
Let's take a look at my working solution online and show you what I'm expecting.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000
So here we are in my form. It's at \signup.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
This is the same form we used in unit 2, and it has the same validation.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.000
If I type in some junk or forget to validate my passwords, I get an error message.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000
If I were to type in valid data and hit submit,

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
it takes me to a welcome page.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
Notice this time there is no user in the welcome. That's because it set a cookie.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:46.000
What that did is registered my user, I did the whole password hashing salting thing.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.000
It's hard for us to test that, but what we can test is that after we log in,

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:56.000
the page we get redirected to should have the user name in it, and we should have a cookie.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:01.000
I've installed this edit this cookie extension in Chrome, which is really handy for this sort of thing,

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.000
to let me view a cookie, and we can see we have a cookie named userID.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:11.000
It's value is 2001 pipe and then a hash, which should look familiar from this lesson.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:17.000
If I were to change this to a different user ID and then reload this welcome page,

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.000
it would redirect me to the signup page, because the cookie is no longer valid.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
That is the first part of this homework--implement this signup page,

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.000
have a form that still checks for errors like unit 2,

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.000
and then if the user registers it redirects you to the welcome page.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.000
If the user already exists, it should give an error that says that user already exists.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.000
Okay, when you're done with that, submit the URL with that behavior here,

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
and we will check it.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
Okay. Good luck.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:50.000
We'll included, of course, more detailed description in the text description of this homework.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.000
All of those form values and the form names and stuff that we'll be testing will be clear.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.000
Okay. Good luck.
