00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:32.770
PROFESSOR: Hi.

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:35.880
Today, we're going to generalize
our discussion of

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:41.240
series to cover series of
functions rather than series

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:42.490
of just constants.

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:45.130
In other words, you'll notice
that, up until now, what we've

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:47.790
been doing in our discussion of
series was have a bunch of

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:50.180
fixed numbers and
then add them.

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:52.850
You see, in the same way that
one starts with constants and

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:56.020
ordinary arithmetic and then
starts talking about

00:00:56.020 --> 00:01:00.000
functions, the same thing occurs
here, that maybe we are

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.470
now interested in a series
over a range of different

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:04.780
values of 'x'.

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:07.680
Now, rather than to talk
abstractly about this, I'd

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:12.130
like to return to a topic that
we touched upon briefly much

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:15.140
earlier in the course, and then
come back to that topic

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:17.760
with far greater power
than we were able to

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:19.580
exhibit up until now.

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:24.160
And it's the idea of
approximating a function by

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:25.060
polynomials.

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:27.930
In other words, this question
of degree of contact.

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:31.900
And again, rather than review
that abstractly, let's talk in

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:33.370
terms of a picture.

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:35.240
You see, today's lecture
is called polynomial

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:37.550
approximations, and
the idea is this.

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:41.060
Let's suppose we have the curve,
'y' equals 'f of x'.

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:42.140
It's smooth.

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:44.520
It passes through the origin.

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.020
And we're told the following.

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:50.230
We say, look, we're interested
in approximating this curve in

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:52.960
a neighborhood of 'x' equals
0-- in other words, at this

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:54.010
point here--

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:56.440
by various polynomials.

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:58.590
Now, the simplest polynomial,
of course, is a constant.

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:01.290
In other words, the question
is, how should we choose a

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:04.790
straight line, 'y' equals a
constant, 'y' equals ''P sub

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:06.595
0' of x'-- in other words,
a polynomial

00:02:06.595 --> 00:02:08.610
of degree 0, a constant--

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:12.880
if we want the best possible
horizontal line that

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:15.870
approximates the curve at
this particular point?

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:18.760
And I think you can see that
it's rather trivial at this

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:21.700
case to say, OK, let's take
the horizontal line that

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:23.240
passes through this point.

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:26.610
See, any other horizontal line
misses this point altogether.

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:28.490
OK, so far, so good.

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:30.750
Then somebody says, now, look
it, if we remove the

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:33.270
restriction that the line be
horizontal, what about any

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:33.990
straight line?

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:37.720
What straight line has the best
degree of contact with

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:39.710
the curve at this particular
point?

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:42.280
In other words, what first
degree polynomial has the

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:44.410
highest degree of contact
over here?

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:46.760
Now again, sparing
you the details--

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:50.070
because the details are
supplied in the text--

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:52.450
the polynomial there
is simply what?

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:56.190
'f of 0' plus ''f prime
of 0' times 'x''.

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:58.330
In other words, it's
a tangent line.

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:02.080
The basic equation of a tangent
line is 'y' equals 'mx

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:06.480
plus b', where 'm' is the slope,
which is 'f prime of

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:10.060
0', and 'b' is the y-intercept,
which is

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:11.800
'f of 0' over here.

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:13.400
Now, the next question
comes up.

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:17.380
What if we wanted a quadratic
polynomial, a second degree

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:20.290
polynomial that fits the curve
even better, in other words,

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:22.350
has a greater degree
of contact at

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:23.720
this particular point?

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:27.310
Let's label that 'y' equals ''P
sub 2' of x' to indicate a

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:29.890
second degree polynomial.

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:32.430
And to analyze what that
polynomial must look like,

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:35.910
let's simply write down some
undetermined coefficients

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:41.430
here, namely, let's let 'P2 of
x' be 'a0 plus 'a1x' plus 'a2

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:42.760
'x squared''.

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:46.110
And the idea is to determine
what 'a0', 'a1', and 'a2' must

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:49.650
look like if this polynomial is
to have a maximum degree of

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:53.940
contact with the curve,
'y' equals 'f of x'.

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:56.350
Now, what do you mean by maximum
degree of contact?

00:03:56.350 --> 00:04:01.330
Well, what you mean is you
want the function at 0 to

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:03.620
equal the given function at 0.

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:07.720
You want the first derivative
of 'P2' evaluated at 0 to

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:10.150
equal the derivative of
'f' evaluated at 0.

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:13.590
And you want the second
derivative of 'P2' evaluated

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:16.000
at 0 equal to ''f double
prime' of 0'.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.649
Well, let's go through
this in slow motion.

00:04:18.649 --> 00:04:23.090
First of all, 'P2 of
0' is simply 'a0'.

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:29.580
'P2 prime' is simply 'a1 plus '2
a2 x'', and evaluating that

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:32.460
when 'x' equals 0, we
just have 'a1'.

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:35.700
So 'f of 0' must equal 'a0'.

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:38.480
'a1' must equal 'f
prime of 0'.

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:40.250
Now, what about the
second derivative?

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:43.260
Notice that every time we
differentiate this polynomial,

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:44.780
another term drops out.

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:48.780
'a0' drops out the first time,
'a1' the second time.

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:51.580
And when you've differentiated
this term twice, all you have

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:53.320
left is '2 a2'.

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:55.040
In other words, 'P2
double prime'

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:57.570
evaluated at 0 is '2 a2'.

00:04:57.570 --> 00:05:00.210
That must be 'f double
prime' of 0.

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:06.450
Equating these two, 'a2' must
be the second derivative of

00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:09.050
'f' evaluated at 0 over 2.

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:12.140
I inadvertently wrote in 2
factorial here, which is the

00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:15.100
right answer, but I haven't led
up to that yet, so if you

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:18.050
want to call this
2, that's fine.

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:19.670
At any rate, here's
what I've shown.

00:05:19.670 --> 00:05:22.900
What I've shown is that, if
you want the polynomial of

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:27.830
degree 2 that fits the curve the
best, in a neighborhood of

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:30.480
0 comma 'f of 0',
this is how the

00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:32.810
coefficients must be chosen.

00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:36.650
And in fact, this situation
generalizes very nicely.

00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:39.690
You see, suppose you want the
n-th degree polynomial

00:05:39.690 --> 00:05:40.950
expression.

00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:43.550
Differentiate this 'n' times.

00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:46.240
You see, each time you
differentiate, one of these

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:47.430
terms drops out.

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:51.070
What happens to this term
as you differentiate it?

00:05:51.070 --> 00:05:53.230
The first time you differentiate
it, you bring

00:05:53.230 --> 00:05:54.370
down an 'n'.

00:05:54.370 --> 00:05:56.850
The next time you differentiate,
you bring down

00:05:56.850 --> 00:05:58.710
an 'n minus 1'.

00:05:58.710 --> 00:06:01.470
By the time you've
differentiated 'n' times, this

00:06:01.470 --> 00:06:06.380
is 'x to the 0', that's 1, 'a
sub n' is still here, and 'n'

00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:09.640
times 'n minus 1' times 'n minus
2', et cetera, is just

00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:11.840
what we call 'n factorial'.

00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:15.270
In other words, the n-th
derivative of ''P sub n' of x'

00:06:15.270 --> 00:06:17.530
is 'n factorial' times
'a sub n'.

00:06:17.530 --> 00:06:20.970
If you evaluate that at 0,
that's still 'n factorial'

00:06:20.970 --> 00:06:22.820
times 'a sub n'.

00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:25.610
That must also equal the n-th
derivative of the function

00:06:25.610 --> 00:06:29.050
evaluated at 0, by definition
of what you mean an n-th

00:06:29.050 --> 00:06:30.600
degree of contact.

00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:33.910
At any rate, that says that
the n-th coefficient, the

00:06:33.910 --> 00:06:37.050
coefficient of 'x to the n',
must be the n-th derivative of

00:06:37.050 --> 00:06:40.930
'f' evaluated at 0 over
'n factorial'.

00:06:40.930 --> 00:06:43.040
By the way, notice
what this says.

00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:45.630
And we'll come back to this
much more strongly later.

00:06:45.630 --> 00:06:48.660
It says that, for this
coefficient to exist, the n-th

00:06:48.660 --> 00:06:51.080
derivative of 'f' at
0 has to exist.

00:06:51.080 --> 00:06:54.970
In other words, if 'f' does
not possess its n-th

00:06:54.970 --> 00:06:59.010
derivative, this particular
equation doesn't make sense.

00:06:59.010 --> 00:07:01.490
And I'll show you what that
means in a little while.

00:07:01.490 --> 00:07:04.950
But at any rate, notice that
what we've now shown is that

00:07:04.950 --> 00:07:06.120
''P sub n' of x'--

00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:08.170
if you want to use the
sigma notation--

00:07:08.170 --> 00:07:09.530
can be written how?

00:07:09.530 --> 00:07:13.760
Well, it's the sum as 'k' goes
from 0 to 'n', the k-th

00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:18.710
derivative of 'f' evaluated at 0
over 'k factorial', times 'x

00:07:18.710 --> 00:07:19.810
to the k-th' power.

00:07:19.810 --> 00:07:22.350
Which written out longhand
is simply what?

00:07:22.350 --> 00:07:27.130
'a0' plus 'a1x' plus ''a2 'x
squared'' over '2 factorial''

00:07:27.130 --> 00:07:29.890
plus et cetera, the n-th
derivative of 'f' evaluated at

00:07:29.890 --> 00:07:33.920
0 over 'n factorial'
times 'x to the n'.

00:07:33.920 --> 00:07:38.630
And what we do is we let 'P of
x' denote the limit of ''P sub

00:07:38.630 --> 00:07:40.170
n' of x' as 'n' goes
to infinity.

00:07:40.170 --> 00:07:42.900
In other words, for a fixed
'x', we look at what the

00:07:42.900 --> 00:07:47.140
sequence converges to as 'n'
goes to infinity, and we

00:07:47.140 --> 00:07:49.260
denote that as a series.

00:07:49.260 --> 00:07:53.330
You see, what happens is 'x' is
a variable here, but if you

00:07:53.330 --> 00:07:56.370
replace 'x' by a specific
number, what's inside the

00:07:56.370 --> 00:07:59.770
summation sign becomes a
constant which depends only on

00:07:59.770 --> 00:08:01.630
'n', and we're back
to our study of

00:08:01.630 --> 00:08:03.270
ordinary series again.

00:08:03.270 --> 00:08:05.980
Now, what does 'P of x'
mean in this case?

00:08:05.980 --> 00:08:09.940
Going back to our diagram, it
means that, as we let n get

00:08:09.940 --> 00:08:11.780
bigger and bigger and we
determine more and more

00:08:11.780 --> 00:08:13.700
coefficients, we get what?

00:08:13.700 --> 00:08:17.310
Hopefully, what's a better fit
to the curve over here, that

00:08:17.310 --> 00:08:20.680
we get a greater degree of
contact every time we tack on

00:08:20.680 --> 00:08:23.070
the next term in the series.

00:08:23.070 --> 00:08:26.110
Now, because this may seem a
little bit abstract, let's

00:08:26.110 --> 00:08:28.150
illustrate this thing
numerically.

00:08:28.150 --> 00:08:30.490
Let's pick a specific example.

00:08:30.490 --> 00:08:32.799
And I'll pick an easy
one to compute.

00:08:32.799 --> 00:08:35.159
Let 'f of x' be 'e to the x'.

00:08:35.159 --> 00:08:36.549
After all, what could
be easier?

00:08:36.549 --> 00:08:38.770
Because the derivative of 'e to
the x' with respect to 'x'

00:08:38.770 --> 00:08:41.740
is just 'e to the x', so the
n-th derivative of 'e to the

00:08:41.740 --> 00:08:43.510
x' is always 'e to the x'.

00:08:43.510 --> 00:08:46.530
When 'x' is 0, 'e
to the 0' is 1.

00:08:46.530 --> 00:08:49.260
So the n-th derivative
of 'e to the x',

00:08:49.260 --> 00:08:51.250
evaluated at 0, is 1.

00:08:51.250 --> 00:08:54.090
If I divide that by 'n
factorial', I just get '1 over

00:08:54.090 --> 00:08:55.370
'n factorial''.

00:08:55.370 --> 00:08:58.340
In other words, the sequence
of polynomials that

00:08:58.340 --> 00:09:02.680
approximates 'e to the
x' is given by what?

00:09:02.680 --> 00:09:06.900
Summation ''x to the k' over
'k factorial'' as 'k' goes

00:09:06.900 --> 00:09:08.580
from '1 to n'.

00:09:08.580 --> 00:09:11.930
And again, what this
means is what?

00:09:11.930 --> 00:09:16.150
The first approximation is
the line, 'y' equals 1.

00:09:16.150 --> 00:09:19.230
The straight line approximation
for the highest

00:09:19.230 --> 00:09:21.420
degree of contact at
the origin is 'y'

00:09:21.420 --> 00:09:23.060
equals '1 plus x'.

00:09:23.060 --> 00:09:25.990
The best quadratic approximation
is 'y' equals '1

00:09:25.990 --> 00:09:28.680
plus x plus ''x squared'
over 2'.

00:09:28.680 --> 00:09:33.420
The best cubic fit is when 'y'
is '1 plus x plus ''x squared'

00:09:33.420 --> 00:09:38.090
over 2', plus 'x cubed over
6'', 6 being 3 factorial.

00:09:38.090 --> 00:09:41.400
And we can continue on this way,
getting better fits as we

00:09:41.400 --> 00:09:42.810
add more and more terms.

00:09:42.810 --> 00:09:46.220
And again, I've spoken quite
rapidly, the reason being that

00:09:46.220 --> 00:09:49.800
this part is done superbly in
the textbook, complete with

00:09:49.800 --> 00:09:52.870
graphs, tables, and
what have you.

00:09:52.870 --> 00:09:54.290
Now, here's the question.

00:09:54.290 --> 00:09:58.000
The question is, look it,
we can compute 'Pn of x'

00:09:58.000 --> 00:09:59.500
for any given 'n'.

00:09:59.500 --> 00:10:02.280
And we intuitively get the
feeling that, as 'n'

00:10:02.280 --> 00:10:07.080
increases, 'Pn' hopefully will
look more like 'f of x'.

00:10:07.080 --> 00:10:09.990
In other words, what we would
like to do is to be able to

00:10:09.990 --> 00:10:14.930
compare, or better still, to
study 'f of x' by comparing it

00:10:14.930 --> 00:10:18.100
with the limit of 'Pn of x'
as 'n' goes to infinity.

00:10:18.100 --> 00:10:21.320
In other words, what we hope
will happen is that 'f of x'

00:10:21.320 --> 00:10:25.530
looks like ''P sub n' of x'
for large values of 'n'.

00:10:25.530 --> 00:10:27.510
Now, we don't know where this
is going to happen.

00:10:27.510 --> 00:10:32.150
In fact, the remainder of our
course now revolves about

00:10:32.150 --> 00:10:33.480
three questions.

00:10:33.480 --> 00:10:35.210
The three questions
are the following.

00:10:35.210 --> 00:10:38.450
First of all, does the limit,
'Pn of x' as 'n' approaches

00:10:38.450 --> 00:10:40.160
infinity, exist?

00:10:40.160 --> 00:10:45.600
In other words, does 'P of x'
exist in the first place?

00:10:45.600 --> 00:10:48.250
Does this limit always exists
for a given 'x'?

00:10:48.250 --> 00:10:51.200
Secondly, suppose the
limit does exist.

00:10:51.200 --> 00:10:53.590
How do we know it's going to
equal the given function, 'f

00:10:53.590 --> 00:10:55.630
of x', which it's trying
to approximate?

00:10:55.630 --> 00:10:57.590
In other words, how do we know
that we don't get an

00:10:57.590 --> 00:11:01.840
approximation which is nice near
the point of contact, but

00:11:01.840 --> 00:11:04.630
then, no matter how far out
we go beyond the point of

00:11:04.630 --> 00:11:06.470
contact, the approximation
doesn't become

00:11:06.470 --> 00:11:08.010
sufficiently good?

00:11:08.010 --> 00:11:09.330
See?

00:11:09.330 --> 00:11:12.130
And the third question that
comes up, assuming that the

00:11:12.130 --> 00:11:15.050
first have been answered, is
suppose the limit does exist--

00:11:15.050 --> 00:11:17.520
in other words, suppose this
limit function, 'P of x',

00:11:17.520 --> 00:11:20.140
which is a limit of 'Pn of x'
as 'n' approaches infinity,

00:11:20.140 --> 00:11:21.240
does exist--

00:11:21.240 --> 00:11:24.630
the question is, does 'P'
possess the polynomial

00:11:24.630 --> 00:11:27.150
properties that each piece
of 'n' possesses?

00:11:27.150 --> 00:11:30.330
In other words, the question
is, does the limit of a

00:11:30.330 --> 00:11:34.130
sequence of functions have the
same property that each of the

00:11:34.130 --> 00:11:35.920
members of the sequence has?

00:11:35.920 --> 00:11:38.770
For example, every polynomial
is continuous.

00:11:38.770 --> 00:11:41.340
The question, for example, that
might come up is, is the

00:11:41.340 --> 00:11:44.590
limit of a sequence of
continuous functions also

00:11:44.590 --> 00:11:46.040
continuous?

00:11:46.040 --> 00:11:49.020
Now, at first glance, it might
seem as if these are rather

00:11:49.020 --> 00:11:50.250
trivial to answer.

00:11:50.250 --> 00:11:56.620
Let me proceed next by showing
that the answer can be no to

00:11:56.620 --> 00:11:59.600
each of these three questions,
after which we'll then try to

00:11:59.600 --> 00:12:02.420
show when the answer
will be yes.

00:12:02.420 --> 00:12:03.440
The idea is this.

00:12:03.440 --> 00:12:06.300
Let me call these things
counter-examples, even though

00:12:06.300 --> 00:12:09.770
I don't know what better
word to use here.

00:12:09.770 --> 00:12:11.870
In other words, let me show
you an example where the

00:12:11.870 --> 00:12:14.950
answer to each of questions
one, two, and three

00:12:14.950 --> 00:12:17.170
happen to be false.

00:12:17.170 --> 00:12:21.500
For example, let 'f of x'
be '1 over '1 minus x''.

00:12:21.500 --> 00:12:24.600
As a review in taking
derivatives, 'f prime of x'

00:12:24.600 --> 00:12:28.000
would be '1 minus x' to the
minus 2 power, ''f double

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:30.620
prime' of x' would be
2 times '1 minus x'

00:12:30.620 --> 00:12:31.930
to the minus 3 power.

00:12:31.930 --> 00:12:34.280
See, in other words, you bring
down the minus 2, but the

00:12:34.280 --> 00:12:36.830
derivative of what's inside with
respect to 'x' is minus.

00:12:36.830 --> 00:12:39.090
So a minus times
minus is plus.

00:12:39.090 --> 00:12:43.220
Similarly, the third derivative
of 'f of x' is 3

00:12:43.220 --> 00:12:47.650
factorial, 2 times minus 3 times
minus 1, '1 minus x' to

00:12:47.650 --> 00:12:48.740
the minus fourth.

00:12:48.740 --> 00:12:51.050
And in general, the n-th
derivative of 'f', in this

00:12:51.050 --> 00:12:56.240
case, is 'n factorial' times
'1 minus x' to the what?

00:12:56.240 --> 00:12:57.890
Minus 'n minus 1'.

00:12:57.890 --> 00:13:01.780
In other words, notice that the
magnitude of the exponent

00:13:01.780 --> 00:13:06.160
is one greater than the number
we're taking the factorial of.

00:13:06.160 --> 00:13:09.210
At any rate, if I now compute
the n-th derivative of 'f'

00:13:09.210 --> 00:13:13.200
evaluated at 0, I just
get 'n factorial'.

00:13:13.200 --> 00:13:16.950
And if I divide 'n factorial'
by 'n factorial', I get 1.

00:13:16.950 --> 00:13:19.600
In other words, every one of
my coefficients of the

00:13:19.600 --> 00:13:23.130
approximating sequence of
polynomials is going to be 1.

00:13:23.130 --> 00:13:26.430
In other words, the
approximation for 'f of x',

00:13:26.430 --> 00:13:30.970
where 'f of x' is '1 over '1
minus x'', is simply what?

00:13:30.970 --> 00:13:35.657
'Pn of x' is '1 plus x plus 'x
squared'', et cetera, plus et

00:13:35.657 --> 00:13:37.700
cetera, 'x to the n-th' power.

00:13:37.700 --> 00:13:40.050
Now, here's the interesting
point.

00:13:40.050 --> 00:13:41.090
This part is irrelevant.

00:13:41.090 --> 00:13:43.000
I just wanted to show you
something over here.

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:45.670
Notice that 'f of 2'
is clearly minus 1.

00:13:45.670 --> 00:13:48.500
If I replace 'x' by 2
over here, 1 over 1

00:13:48.500 --> 00:13:50.420
minus 2 is minus 1.

00:13:50.420 --> 00:13:52.970
On the other hand, what I claim
is that the limit of a

00:13:52.970 --> 00:13:56.740
sequence, ''P sub n' of x', as
'n' goes to infinity doesn't

00:13:56.740 --> 00:13:59.200
even exist when 'x' is
2, because look what

00:13:59.200 --> 00:14:00.440
happens over here.

00:14:00.440 --> 00:14:02.740
When 'x' is 2, this is what?

00:14:02.740 --> 00:14:07.820
1 plus 2 plus 2 squared plus
et cetera '2 to the n'.

00:14:07.820 --> 00:14:11.840
That's 1 plus 2 plus 4 plus
8 plus 16, et cetera.

00:14:11.840 --> 00:14:15.170
And as I let 'n' go to infinity,
that sum increases

00:14:15.170 --> 00:14:16.200
without bound.

00:14:16.200 --> 00:14:20.650
In other words, here's an
example where the given limit

00:14:20.650 --> 00:14:21.760
didn't have to exist.

00:14:21.760 --> 00:14:24.550
In other words, the sequence
of polynomials does not

00:14:24.550 --> 00:14:28.980
converge at all at
'x' equals 2.

00:14:28.980 --> 00:14:31.090
So much for showing that
the answer to the first

00:14:31.090 --> 00:14:32.610
question can be no.

00:14:32.610 --> 00:14:35.900
As for the second question,
let's define a function as

00:14:35.900 --> 00:14:39.170
follows, to show you why
continuity is so important.

00:14:39.170 --> 00:14:41.880
Let 'f of x' be 'x squared'
if 'x' is less

00:14:41.880 --> 00:14:43.270
than or equal to 2.

00:14:43.270 --> 00:14:46.130
And let it be 4 if 'x'
is greater than 2.

00:14:46.130 --> 00:14:49.100
Now, if we compute the
derivatives of 'f' evaluated

00:14:49.100 --> 00:14:52.320
at 0, we find that what?
'f of 0' is 0.

00:14:52.320 --> 00:14:54.970
See, 'x squared' at 0 is 0.

00:14:54.970 --> 00:14:57.600
'2x' at 0 is 0.

00:14:57.600 --> 00:15:00.650
The second derivative here
is 2, so ''f double

00:15:00.650 --> 00:15:02.440
prime' of 0' is 2.

00:15:02.440 --> 00:15:05.640
And the third derivative and
higher, since this is only 'x

00:15:05.640 --> 00:15:07.410
squared', are identically 0.

00:15:07.410 --> 00:15:09.960
In other words, notice that the
second derivative of 'f'

00:15:09.960 --> 00:15:11.650
evaluated at 0 is 2.

00:15:11.650 --> 00:15:13.740
All other derivatives are 0.

00:15:13.740 --> 00:15:17.340
In other words, notice that
'Pn of x' is equal to 'x

00:15:17.340 --> 00:15:20.300
squared' when 'n' is
greater than 2.

00:15:20.300 --> 00:15:22.730
And that's a straightforward
computation.

00:15:22.730 --> 00:15:25.610
I will drill you on the homework
problems to show you

00:15:25.610 --> 00:15:27.810
how to get more facility.

00:15:27.810 --> 00:15:28.700
We're doing these things.

00:15:28.700 --> 00:15:30.470
But here's the key point.

00:15:30.470 --> 00:15:33.840
Let's look to see what the limit
of 'Pn of x' is as 'n'

00:15:33.840 --> 00:15:35.150
approaches infinity.

00:15:35.150 --> 00:15:38.710
Since 'Pn of x' is equal to 'x
squared' for all 'n', in

00:15:38.710 --> 00:15:41.130
particular, then, since this
doesn't depend on 'n', the

00:15:41.130 --> 00:15:43.090
limit off 'Pn of x'
as 'n' goes to

00:15:43.090 --> 00:15:45.680
infinity is just 'x squared'.

00:15:45.680 --> 00:15:47.040
What this says is this.

00:15:47.040 --> 00:15:52.490
Our function, 'f of x',
graphs like this.

00:15:52.490 --> 00:15:54.040
The sequence of polynomials--

00:15:54.040 --> 00:15:56.230
which, by the way, converge
to the limit

00:15:56.230 --> 00:15:58.120
function, 'x squared'--

00:15:58.120 --> 00:15:59.630
look what they do.

00:15:59.630 --> 00:16:01.750
They're just 'y' equals
'x squared'.

00:16:01.750 --> 00:16:04.700
In other words, somehow or
other, when we got to this

00:16:04.700 --> 00:16:07.740
sharp corner-- in other words,
notice that 'f of x' is not

00:16:07.740 --> 00:16:09.660
differentiable at this point--

00:16:09.660 --> 00:16:13.300
our sequence of polynomials
blissfully went right on their

00:16:13.300 --> 00:16:16.260
merry way smoothly while
the function itself

00:16:16.260 --> 00:16:17.630
leveled off like this.

00:16:17.630 --> 00:16:20.460
In other words, the limit
function always exist, but as

00:16:20.460 --> 00:16:24.140
soon as 'x' is greater than 2,
in this example, the function,

00:16:24.140 --> 00:16:27.480
'P of x', no longer is
the same as 'f of x'.

00:16:27.480 --> 00:16:30.860
You see, 'P of x' is going up
like this, 'f of x' has just

00:16:30.860 --> 00:16:32.170
leveled off this way.

00:16:32.170 --> 00:16:35.240
There are even more glaring
examples, but I will leave

00:16:35.240 --> 00:16:38.500
those for the supplementary
notes to go

00:16:38.500 --> 00:16:39.740
into in more detail.

00:16:39.740 --> 00:16:41.120
But so far, we've seen what?

00:16:41.120 --> 00:16:44.840
That the answers to questions
one and two can be no.

00:16:44.840 --> 00:16:47.000
Let's now show that the
answer to question

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:48.250
three can also be no.

00:16:52.370 --> 00:16:55.880
Let's define a sequence of
polynomials, ''P sub n' of x',

00:16:55.880 --> 00:16:59.620
to be 'x to the n', where the
domain of 'P sub n' is the

00:16:59.620 --> 00:17:01.800
interval from 0 to 1.

00:17:01.800 --> 00:17:04.329
What that means is something
like this.

00:17:04.329 --> 00:17:06.290
See, here's 0, 0.

00:17:06.290 --> 00:17:09.500
And I hope this reminds you of a
homework problem that we had

00:17:09.500 --> 00:17:12.450
very early in the course, but
that's irrelevant whether it

00:17:12.450 --> 00:17:13.250
does or not.

00:17:13.250 --> 00:17:15.490
'P1 of x' would look
like this.

00:17:15.490 --> 00:17:18.660
'P2 of x' would look
like this.

00:17:18.660 --> 00:17:20.390
'P3 of x' would look
like this.

00:17:20.390 --> 00:17:22.510
In other words, all of
these curves pass

00:17:22.510 --> 00:17:25.270
through 0, 0 and 1, 1.

00:17:25.270 --> 00:17:28.060
But as 'n' increases,
the degree of

00:17:28.060 --> 00:17:31.070
contact here gets better.

00:17:31.070 --> 00:17:34.710
At any rate, let's take a look
at the limit function.

00:17:34.710 --> 00:17:36.740
'P of x' is the limit of
''P sub n' of x' as

00:17:36.740 --> 00:17:38.550
'n' approaches infinity.

00:17:38.550 --> 00:17:41.810
'x to the n', as 'n' approaches
infinity, well, if

00:17:41.810 --> 00:17:44.930
'x' is less than 1 in magnitude,
'x to the n-th'

00:17:44.930 --> 00:17:46.120
approach is 0.

00:17:46.120 --> 00:17:49.460
On the other hand, if 'x' is
equal to 1, 1 to the n-th

00:17:49.460 --> 00:17:52.020
power is still 1 as 'n'
approaches infinity.

00:17:52.020 --> 00:17:54.180
Therefore, 'P of x'
would be what?

00:17:54.180 --> 00:18:00.450
It's 0 if 'x' is greater than or
equal to 0 but less than 1.

00:18:00.450 --> 00:18:03.010
And it's 1 if 'x' equals 1.

00:18:03.010 --> 00:18:04.670
Now, here's the key point.

00:18:04.670 --> 00:18:08.130
Observe that, since 'Pn of x'
is a polynomial, it's, in

00:18:08.130 --> 00:18:09.955
particular, continuous.

00:18:09.955 --> 00:18:12.450
In other words, each
'P sub n' is a

00:18:12.450 --> 00:18:15.370
continuous function, unbroken.

00:18:15.370 --> 00:18:18.210
On the other hand, look
at the limit function.

00:18:18.210 --> 00:18:21.080
It's 0 all the way up to 1.

00:18:21.080 --> 00:18:24.085
And that 1, the function
jumps to 1.

00:18:24.085 --> 00:18:29.060
In other words, graph-wise,
the thing looks like this.

00:18:29.060 --> 00:18:31.620
This is a graph, 'y'
equals 'P of x'.

00:18:31.620 --> 00:18:32.620
It's 0.

00:18:32.620 --> 00:18:34.420
All of a sudden, it jumps.

00:18:34.420 --> 00:18:37.060
Is the limit function,
therefore, continuous

00:18:37.060 --> 00:18:38.320
with 'x' equals 1.

00:18:38.320 --> 00:18:40.140
And the answer is no.

00:18:40.140 --> 00:18:42.190
There's a jump discontinuity
here.

00:18:42.190 --> 00:18:45.440
In other words, observe that
each 'P sub n' is continuous

00:18:45.440 --> 00:18:46.940
when 'x' equals 1.

00:18:46.940 --> 00:18:49.790
The limit function exists,
but it isn't continuous

00:18:49.790 --> 00:18:51.160
when 'x' equals 1.

00:18:51.160 --> 00:18:54.690
In other words, the properties
of a sequence of convergent

00:18:54.690 --> 00:18:57.900
functions do not have
to be inherited

00:18:57.900 --> 00:19:00.450
by the limit function.

00:19:00.450 --> 00:19:02.920
That shows, then, that the
answer to our three

00:19:02.920 --> 00:19:04.610
questions can be no.

00:19:04.610 --> 00:19:07.620
What we would like to do is
find out when and if the

00:19:07.620 --> 00:19:09.260
answer will be yes.

00:19:09.260 --> 00:19:12.460
What we shall do for the
remainder of today's lesson is

00:19:12.460 --> 00:19:14.590
answer the first
two questions.

00:19:14.590 --> 00:19:18.270
And this, by the way, is also
done very nicely in the text.

00:19:18.270 --> 00:19:21.250
The third question, for some
reason or other, is beyond the

00:19:21.250 --> 00:19:22.150
scope of the text.

00:19:22.150 --> 00:19:26.200
We will discuss this in our
future lectures, plus the

00:19:26.200 --> 00:19:27.410
supplementary notes.

00:19:27.410 --> 00:19:32.660
In fact, that the answer to
question number three will be

00:19:32.660 --> 00:19:35.710
the end of our course, when
we finally answer

00:19:35.710 --> 00:19:36.910
that particular question.

00:19:36.910 --> 00:19:39.490
But at any rate, what I'm saying
now is let's spend the

00:19:39.490 --> 00:19:42.260
remainder of today's lesson
in showing how to answer

00:19:42.260 --> 00:19:45.110
questions one and two in the
affirmative, and we'll save

00:19:45.110 --> 00:19:48.260
question three for the
remaining lectures.

00:19:48.260 --> 00:19:50.790
The first thing I'd like to
point out is the role of the

00:19:50.790 --> 00:19:53.940
ratio test and absolute
convergence.

00:19:53.940 --> 00:19:57.480
Namely, given the series
summation 'a n 'x to the n''--

00:19:57.480 --> 00:19:59.990
And by the way, if you haven't
noticed this by now, it's

00:19:59.990 --> 00:20:03.690
rather conventional sometimes,
to save time, not to put the

00:20:03.690 --> 00:20:05.020
subscripts on here.

00:20:05.020 --> 00:20:07.980
But if it bothers you, I mean,
I could do things like this.

00:20:07.980 --> 00:20:11.950
It's just that to save time and
space, I sometimes will

00:20:11.950 --> 00:20:13.310
not put the subscripts
on here.

00:20:13.310 --> 00:20:16.380
But at any rate, let's just talk
about this for a moment.

00:20:16.380 --> 00:20:19.980
Notice that a series converges
as soon as it converges

00:20:19.980 --> 00:20:21.780
absolutely.

00:20:21.780 --> 00:20:26.430
The point is that, for a
positive series, I can use the

00:20:26.430 --> 00:20:28.700
ratio test or its equivalent.

00:20:28.700 --> 00:20:33.850
Namely, for example, what I can
do is to test summation

00:20:33.850 --> 00:20:37.260
absolute value, 'a n 'x to the
n'', for convergence by the

00:20:37.260 --> 00:20:40.170
ratio test, by the comparison
m by the

00:20:40.170 --> 00:20:43.590
integral test, et cetera.

00:20:43.590 --> 00:20:46.150
And what I'm saying is, if
that particular series

00:20:46.150 --> 00:20:48.960
converges, then the original
series, namely, the one

00:20:48.960 --> 00:20:53.020
without the absolute value
signs, converges absolutely

00:20:53.020 --> 00:20:54.620
for that same value of 'x'.

00:20:54.620 --> 00:20:57.300
Well, again, instead of talking
about that, let's look

00:20:57.300 --> 00:20:58.160
at a particular example.

00:20:58.160 --> 00:20:59.870
And it looks like I've scraped
the blackboard

00:20:59.870 --> 00:21:00.870
here a little bit.

00:21:00.870 --> 00:21:02.440
Let me just--

00:21:02.440 --> 00:21:03.850
The first example is this.

00:21:03.850 --> 00:21:06.800
Let's suppose you look at
summation n goes from 0 to

00:21:06.800 --> 00:21:09.990
infinity, absolute value of
'x to the n-th' power.

00:21:09.990 --> 00:21:14.340
By the way, notice that this is
a geometric series with a

00:21:14.340 --> 00:21:16.280
ratio absolute value of 'x'.

00:21:16.280 --> 00:21:19.570
Consequently, the series
converges if and only if the

00:21:19.570 --> 00:21:22.300
absolute value of 'x'
is less than 1.

00:21:22.300 --> 00:21:24.900
By the way, let me make
a little aside here.

00:21:24.900 --> 00:21:28.300
Many people would tackle this
problem by the ratio test, as

00:21:28.300 --> 00:21:29.640
I hinted at over here.

00:21:29.640 --> 00:21:33.170
Namely, let the n-th term be
the absolute value of 'x to

00:21:33.170 --> 00:21:34.270
the n-th' power.

00:21:34.270 --> 00:21:36.930
Then the 'n plus first' term
would be the absolute value of

00:21:36.930 --> 00:21:39.070
'x to the 'n plus
first'' power.

00:21:39.070 --> 00:21:42.150
Then the ratio between these
two would be the absolute

00:21:42.150 --> 00:21:43.580
value of 'x'.

00:21:43.580 --> 00:21:47.690
Therefore, row, which is this
limit, would be the limit of

00:21:47.690 --> 00:21:53.120
the absolute value of 'x'
as 'n' goes to infinity.

00:21:53.120 --> 00:21:56.230
That's just equal to the
absolute value of 'x' itself.

00:21:56.230 --> 00:21:59.920
And for convergence, notice that
row must be less than 1,

00:21:59.920 --> 00:22:00.720
and that says what?

00:22:00.720 --> 00:22:03.820
The absolute value of 'x' must
be less than 1, just

00:22:03.820 --> 00:22:05.050
as we did over here.

00:22:05.050 --> 00:22:08.580
I simply would like to make a
little aside over here, and

00:22:08.580 --> 00:22:11.360
that is, if you use this
particular approach, that

00:22:11.360 --> 00:22:14.430
comes under the heading of
circular reasoning, because

00:22:14.430 --> 00:22:18.340
you may recall when we proved
the ratio test, we did it by

00:22:18.340 --> 00:22:21.940
comparing the series with the
geometric series, which meant

00:22:21.940 --> 00:22:23.570
that we already had
to know that the

00:22:23.570 --> 00:22:25.400
geometric series converged.

00:22:25.400 --> 00:22:27.690
And this is a geometric
series.

00:22:27.690 --> 00:22:30.380
But that's an aside which I just
wanted to mention to you

00:22:30.380 --> 00:22:32.140
in forms of circular
reasoning.

00:22:32.140 --> 00:22:34.600
The important point to
observe is what?

00:22:34.600 --> 00:22:38.400
That this series converges if
the absolute value of 'x' is

00:22:38.400 --> 00:22:39.600
less than 1.

00:22:39.600 --> 00:22:42.400
Consequently, that means that
the series without the

00:22:42.400 --> 00:22:46.310
absolute value sign converges,
in fact, absolutely, if the

00:22:46.310 --> 00:22:48.660
absolute value of 'x'
is less than 1.

00:22:48.660 --> 00:22:53.220
In other words, for this
particular series, '1 plus x

00:22:53.220 --> 00:22:56.160
plus 'x squared' plus 'x
cubed'', et cetera, that will

00:22:56.160 --> 00:22:59.990
converge to a finite limit
function if the absolute value

00:22:59.990 --> 00:23:02.590
of 'x' is less than 1.

00:23:02.590 --> 00:23:05.200
Let's look at another example.

00:23:05.200 --> 00:23:07.950
Suppose we look at the absolute
value of 'x to the

00:23:07.950 --> 00:23:10.842
n-th' power over
'n factorial'.

00:23:10.842 --> 00:23:13.530
If we look at this, the nth term
is the absolute value of

00:23:13.530 --> 00:23:16.210
'x to the n-th' over
'n factorial'.

00:23:16.210 --> 00:23:18.520
The 'n plus first' term,
therefore, is the absolute

00:23:18.520 --> 00:23:21.450
value of 'x to the 'n plus
1'', over ''n plus 1'

00:23:21.450 --> 00:23:22.510
factorial'.

00:23:22.510 --> 00:23:25.280
Therefore, the ratio between
the 'n plus first' term and

00:23:25.280 --> 00:23:30.980
the n-th term is the absolute
value of 'x' over 'n plus 1'.

00:23:30.980 --> 00:23:32.960
Rho is this particular limit.

00:23:32.960 --> 00:23:35.730
Well, the limit of the absolute
value of 'x' over 'n

00:23:35.730 --> 00:23:37.760
plus 1', as 'n' approaches
infinity--

00:23:37.760 --> 00:23:39.040
and here's the key point.

00:23:39.040 --> 00:23:42.330
Notice that 'x' is a fixed but
finite number once we get

00:23:42.330 --> 00:23:42.830
started here.

00:23:42.830 --> 00:23:45.030
In other words, we pick
an 'x' and fixed it.

00:23:45.030 --> 00:23:46.870
That means that that
stays constant.

00:23:46.870 --> 00:23:49.620
But as 'n' goes to infinity,
the denominator increases

00:23:49.620 --> 00:23:50.590
without bound.

00:23:50.590 --> 00:23:52.470
That makes the limit
equal to 0.

00:23:52.470 --> 00:23:55.860
And 0 is obviously less than
1, regardless of what the

00:23:55.860 --> 00:23:57.760
value of 'x' happens
to be here.

00:23:57.760 --> 00:24:00.380
In other words, in this
particular case, this

00:24:00.380 --> 00:24:04.160
particular series converges for
all real values of 'x'.

00:24:04.160 --> 00:24:06.920
And we sometimes abbreviate that
by saying the absolute

00:24:06.920 --> 00:24:09.660
value of 'x' is less
than infinity.

00:24:09.660 --> 00:24:12.130
And therefore, the original
series, meaning the one

00:24:12.130 --> 00:24:14.770
without the absolute value sign,
would, in particular,

00:24:14.770 --> 00:24:17.600
converge also for
all real 'x'.

00:24:17.600 --> 00:24:22.240
The important point is that, in
general, given any series--

00:24:22.240 --> 00:24:24.650
in other words, limit of a
sequence of polynomials of

00:24:24.650 --> 00:24:26.350
this particular type--

00:24:26.350 --> 00:24:28.710
there always exists
a number 'M'.

00:24:28.710 --> 00:24:30.560
Now, 'M' may be as small as 0.

00:24:30.560 --> 00:24:32.570
It may be as large
as infinity.

00:24:32.570 --> 00:24:36.630
But there always exists an 'M',
such that the particular

00:24:36.630 --> 00:24:40.520
series will converge absolutely
if the magnitude of

00:24:40.520 --> 00:24:43.680
'x' is less than 'M', and
diverge if the magnitude of

00:24:43.680 --> 00:24:45.500
'x' is greater than 'M'.

00:24:45.500 --> 00:24:48.410
In other words, this particular
'M', which is

00:24:48.410 --> 00:24:51.400
called the radius of
convergence, governs the

00:24:51.400 --> 00:24:53.240
answer to the first question.

00:24:53.240 --> 00:24:57.460
In other words, it's this 'M',
which we often find by the

00:24:57.460 --> 00:25:01.240
ratio test, that determines
where the sequence of

00:25:01.240 --> 00:25:04.310
functions, ''P sub n' of x', for
what values of 'x', that

00:25:04.310 --> 00:25:06.610
will converge to 'P of x'.

00:25:06.610 --> 00:25:09.410
And again, I think this is kind
of difficult for you to

00:25:09.410 --> 00:25:10.370
see abstractly.

00:25:10.370 --> 00:25:11.890
The proof is done in the text.

00:25:11.890 --> 00:25:14.040
What I'd like to do is show
you pictorially what's

00:25:14.040 --> 00:25:15.480
happening over here.

00:25:15.480 --> 00:25:18.600
See, let's suppose we have
our series, summation

00:25:18.600 --> 00:25:20.390
'a n 'x to the n''.

00:25:20.390 --> 00:25:24.600
And we pick a particular value
of 'x', say 'x sub 1'.

00:25:24.600 --> 00:25:26.480
Now, the idea is this.

00:25:26.480 --> 00:25:29.510
If this particular series
converges--

00:25:29.510 --> 00:25:32.320
and the proof is given in the
text, and I won't repeat it

00:25:32.320 --> 00:25:34.350
here because I want you to
see the overview here--

00:25:34.350 --> 00:25:36.170
if this particular series
converges--

00:25:36.170 --> 00:25:39.000
in other words, if the series
converges when 'x' is equal to

00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:40.180
'x sub 1'--

00:25:40.180 --> 00:25:43.960
then it can be shown that it
converges absolutely for any

00:25:43.960 --> 00:25:47.080
'x' which is smaller in
magnitude then 'x sub 1'.

00:25:47.080 --> 00:25:48.750
In other words, the
gist is this.

00:25:48.750 --> 00:25:51.950
If I know that the series
converges over here, I can

00:25:51.950 --> 00:25:55.075
then draw this interval
surrounding 0, and conclude

00:25:55.075 --> 00:25:58.750
that the series converges
in this entire interval.

00:25:58.750 --> 00:26:02.800
Correspondingly, if this
particular series diverges--

00:26:02.800 --> 00:26:05.620
and by the way, the whole proof
of this thing hinges on

00:26:05.620 --> 00:26:08.120
the comparison test,
essentially.

00:26:08.120 --> 00:26:11.440
See, if this thing diverges,
then certainly, if 'x' is

00:26:11.440 --> 00:26:15.670
larger than 'x1' in magnitude,
this will also diverge.

00:26:15.670 --> 00:26:18.530
In other words, once I know
that my series diverges at

00:26:18.530 --> 00:26:20.700
this particular value
of 'x1'..

00:26:20.700 --> 00:26:25.280
of 'x', I know it diverges for
all values of 'x' which are

00:26:25.280 --> 00:26:28.750
greater in magnitude then 'x1',
which means, in terms of

00:26:28.750 --> 00:26:33.440
a picture, for everything
further away from 0, then 'x1'

00:26:33.440 --> 00:26:34.790
and minus 'x1'.

00:26:34.790 --> 00:26:37.600
In other words, if this
converges, this converges.

00:26:37.600 --> 00:26:43.110
In here, if this diverges, we
have divergence out here.

00:26:43.110 --> 00:26:44.290
Now, what does that mean?

00:26:44.290 --> 00:26:50.050
Let me show you again in terms
of a extended diagram.

00:26:50.050 --> 00:26:52.680
See, the idea goes something
like this.

00:26:52.680 --> 00:26:56.530
Given the series summation 'a n
'x to the n'', pick a number

00:26:56.530 --> 00:26:58.400
'x' equal to 'x1'.

00:26:58.400 --> 00:27:01.680
Suppose the series converges
at 'x1'.

00:27:01.680 --> 00:27:05.800
Then we know that it converges
every place in here, so

00:27:05.800 --> 00:27:07.520
there's no need to check
this any further.

00:27:07.520 --> 00:27:10.430
What we do next is we
pick a number, 'x2',

00:27:10.430 --> 00:27:12.020
outside of this interval.

00:27:12.020 --> 00:27:13.990
Say 'x2' is over here.

00:27:13.990 --> 00:27:16.180
Suppose, for the sake of
argument-- see, what we're

00:27:16.180 --> 00:27:20.570
saying is 'a n 'x 1 to the
n'' converges, so you

00:27:20.570 --> 00:27:23.130
just suppose this.

00:27:23.130 --> 00:27:24.850
That gives us this picture.

00:27:24.850 --> 00:27:28.890
Suppose 'a n 'x2 to
the n'' diverges.

00:27:28.890 --> 00:27:31.690
Then we know that the series
diverges for all

00:27:31.690 --> 00:27:33.850
larger values of 'x'.

00:27:33.850 --> 00:27:37.390
Now we know how the series
behaves exactly, except in the

00:27:37.390 --> 00:27:39.620
interval between
'x1' and 'x2'.

00:27:39.620 --> 00:27:41.410
So what we do next is what?

00:27:41.410 --> 00:27:44.210
We pick a number which
we'll call 'x3'.

00:27:44.210 --> 00:27:47.830
We then see whether this
converges or diverges.

00:27:47.830 --> 00:27:51.140
If it converges at 'x3', we
know that the radius of

00:27:51.140 --> 00:27:53.870
convergence extends all
the way between minus

00:27:53.870 --> 00:27:56.280
'x3' and plus 'x3'.

00:27:56.280 --> 00:28:01.190
If it diverges, we know that,
from 'x3' out and minus 'x3'

00:28:01.190 --> 00:28:03.090
out, the series diverges.

00:28:03.090 --> 00:28:06.700
In any event, each time we
perform this operation, we cut

00:28:06.700 --> 00:28:08.470
the remaining space down.

00:28:08.470 --> 00:28:10.420
And we can keep on
going this way.

00:28:10.420 --> 00:28:14.040
And you see what you're doing
then, is you're zeroing in on

00:28:14.040 --> 00:28:16.860
this number that we called
capital 'M' before.

00:28:16.860 --> 00:28:18.540
You see, it's just a series
of refinements.

00:28:18.540 --> 00:28:20.580
And by the way, the
formal proof of

00:28:20.580 --> 00:28:21.920
this looks very messy.

00:28:21.920 --> 00:28:24.300
And yet, when it's stripped of
all embellishment, that's

00:28:24.300 --> 00:28:26.440
exactly what the formal
proof says.

00:28:26.440 --> 00:28:31.280
Well, at any rate, I will
reinforce the rest of this

00:28:31.280 --> 00:28:34.940
between the text, the notes,
and the learning exercises.

00:28:34.940 --> 00:28:38.720
All I want to do now is talk
about the second question.

00:28:38.720 --> 00:28:41.000
In other words, we've now talked
about something called

00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:44.490
the radius of convergence, that
tells us when the series

00:28:44.490 --> 00:28:47.140
of functions converges to
the limit function.

00:28:47.140 --> 00:28:50.510
Now the question is, how can we
measure whether that limit

00:28:50.510 --> 00:28:53.080
function converges to the
original function that we're

00:28:53.080 --> 00:28:54.470
trying to approximate?

00:28:54.470 --> 00:28:57.160
In other words, how do we know
whether 'P of x' actually

00:28:57.160 --> 00:28:59.010
equals 'f of x'?

00:28:59.010 --> 00:29:04.690
And again, this is done
extremely well in the text.

00:29:04.690 --> 00:29:07.370
It's called Taylor's theorem
with remainder.

00:29:07.370 --> 00:29:09.550
The proof is given very,
very nicely.

00:29:09.550 --> 00:29:12.440
I think the hardest part is to
show what the thing means.

00:29:12.440 --> 00:29:15.300
You see, using integration
by parts repeatedly--

00:29:15.300 --> 00:29:17.000
which is done in the text--

00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:20.180
it follows that, if 'f' and
its first 'n plus 1'

00:29:20.180 --> 00:29:23.750
derivatives exist at 'x' equals
0, it turns out-- and

00:29:23.750 --> 00:29:25.320
this is why this is called
Taylor's theorem with

00:29:25.320 --> 00:29:26.250
remainder--

00:29:26.250 --> 00:29:31.400
it turns out that 'f of x' can
be written as 'Pn of x' plus a

00:29:31.400 --> 00:29:34.510
remainder term-- ''r sub n'
of x'-- a remainder term.

00:29:34.510 --> 00:29:37.260
And then you see,
computationally, the text

00:29:37.260 --> 00:29:39.900
shows what that remainder
term looks like.

00:29:39.900 --> 00:29:44.005
It happens to be the integral
from 0 to 'x', ''x minus t' to

00:29:44.005 --> 00:29:48.700
the n-th' over 'n factorial',
'n plus first' derivative of

00:29:48.700 --> 00:29:53.970
'f of t', 'dt', from 't' equals
0 to 't' equals 'x'.

00:29:53.970 --> 00:29:55.080
This looks messy.

00:29:55.080 --> 00:29:56.630
It is messy.

00:29:56.630 --> 00:30:01.035
There's no need to hammer this
home in the lecture part of

00:30:01.035 --> 00:30:01.740
our course.

00:30:01.740 --> 00:30:05.660
What I prefer to do is to give
several learning exercises

00:30:05.660 --> 00:30:07.840
that will give you drill
in using this.

00:30:07.840 --> 00:30:11.250
But the point that I want you
to understand is that, since

00:30:11.250 --> 00:30:14.220
this is all done well in the
text, all I want you to do is

00:30:14.220 --> 00:30:15.890
to see where this
thing fits in.

00:30:15.890 --> 00:30:19.510
In other words, what the text
is showing is, look it, the

00:30:19.510 --> 00:30:21.900
difference between the
function which we're

00:30:21.900 --> 00:30:26.400
approximating at 0 comma 'f
of 0' by this sequence of

00:30:26.400 --> 00:30:30.560
polynomials, the difference
between that function and the

00:30:30.560 --> 00:30:33.990
nth member of that sequence
of polynomials is simply

00:30:33.990 --> 00:30:37.880
something called ''r sub n' of
x', where numerically ''r sub

00:30:37.880 --> 00:30:39.830
n' of x' looks like this.

00:30:39.830 --> 00:30:43.000
And the point is that, if you
now take the limit of this

00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:45.990
expression as 'n' goes to
infinity, remember, 'P of x'

00:30:45.990 --> 00:30:47.100
is this limit.

00:30:47.100 --> 00:30:51.140
Therefore, the only way that 'P
of x' can equal 'f of x' is

00:30:51.140 --> 00:30:56.530
if, for a given value of 'x',
this remainder goes to 0 as

00:30:56.530 --> 00:30:58.070
'n' goes to infinity.

00:30:58.070 --> 00:31:01.360
In other words, leaving the
computational details to the

00:31:01.360 --> 00:31:04.940
text, because it does it very
nicely, what we're saying is

00:31:04.940 --> 00:31:08.290
that the significance of
Taylor's remainder theorem is

00:31:08.290 --> 00:31:11.850
that, to find out where 'f of x'
and 'P of x' are identical,

00:31:11.850 --> 00:31:12.820
we simply--

00:31:12.820 --> 00:31:16.640
and I say simply meaning
conceptually simply--

00:31:16.640 --> 00:31:18.760
computationally, it might
be difficult.

00:31:18.760 --> 00:31:22.750
What we do computationally is
simply find all those values

00:31:22.750 --> 00:31:27.340
of 'x', for which ''r sub n' of
x' goes to 0 in the limit

00:31:27.340 --> 00:31:29.370
as 'n' goes to infinity.

00:31:29.370 --> 00:31:32.270
You see, what we've done is
we've now done two things.

00:31:32.270 --> 00:31:34.410
We've first shown when
the sequence of

00:31:34.410 --> 00:31:36.220
polynomials has a limit.

00:31:36.220 --> 00:31:39.560
And secondly, we've shown when
it does have a limit, when

00:31:39.560 --> 00:31:40.940
will it equal the given
function that

00:31:40.940 --> 00:31:43.170
it's trying to represent.

00:31:43.170 --> 00:31:45.980
The question that still remains
is, how do we know

00:31:45.980 --> 00:31:49.570
that the limit function has the
same properties as each

00:31:49.570 --> 00:31:50.750
member of the sequence?

00:31:50.750 --> 00:31:54.330
In fact, we've just given an
example where the limit

00:31:54.330 --> 00:31:56.470
function had different
properties.

00:31:56.470 --> 00:31:59.600
And the question is, under what
conditions can we be sure

00:31:59.600 --> 00:32:01.810
that certain nice results--

00:32:01.810 --> 00:32:04.360
that we'd like to be true,
because they're true about

00:32:04.360 --> 00:32:06.220
each polynomial in
the sequence--

00:32:06.220 --> 00:32:09.280
actually are true about
the limit function.

00:32:09.280 --> 00:32:11.880
In fact, that shall
be our topic for

00:32:11.880 --> 00:32:13.250
the next two lessons.

00:32:13.250 --> 00:32:16.140
And these next two lectures
should complete the course.

00:32:16.140 --> 00:32:18.480
At any rate, until next
time, goodbye.
