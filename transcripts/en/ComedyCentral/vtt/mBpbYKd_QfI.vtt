00:00:00.867 --> 00:00:04.637
(mechanical sounds and beeping)

00:00:04.637 --> 00:00:06.973
- His big ol' dick
and one of his balls

00:00:06.973 --> 00:00:08.341
fell out of his britches.

00:00:08.341 --> 00:00:09.909
(crowd laughing)

00:00:09.909 --> 00:00:11.378
Yeah. My son goes,

00:00:11.378 --> 00:00:14.381
"Daddy, Mr. Sugar got
a big ol' pee pee."

00:00:14.381 --> 00:00:15.648
(crowd laughing)

00:00:15.648 --> 00:00:18.852 align:start size:88% position:13%
No son, you and I got
pee pees, that's a dick.

00:00:18.852 --> 00:00:23.023 align:start size:81% position:19%
(electronic music)
(splattering)

00:00:24.557 --> 00:00:27.127
(fire burning)

00:00:33.433 --> 00:00:35.769
(explosion)

00:00:37.003 --> 00:00:39.572
(fire burning)

00:00:42.642 --> 00:00:44.978
(explosion)

00:00:47.113 --> 00:00:49.015
(crowd cheering)

00:00:49.015 --> 00:00:50.116 align:start size:81% position:19%
- So, here's a
story with a show.

00:00:50.116 --> 00:00:51.384
Really, it's simple.

00:00:51.384 --> 00:00:52.352
It's just a bunch
of funny people.

00:00:52.352 --> 00:00:53.620
We're all telling true stories.

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:54.988
One of the nicest
guys in America,

00:00:54.988 --> 00:00:57.123 align:start size:97% position:3%
Mr. Ralphie May,
everybody, let him hear it!

00:00:57.123 --> 00:00:59.692
(crowd cheers)

00:01:01.027 --> 00:01:04.497
- My neighbor, Gay
Tony, got married.

00:01:04.497 --> 00:01:05.765
I love him.

00:01:05.765 --> 00:01:07.100
That ain't his real
name, of course,

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:08.935 align:start size:88% position:13%
it's just how it appears
in my cell phone.

00:01:08.935 --> 00:01:10.403
(crowd laughs)

00:01:10.403 --> 00:01:11.237
And, uh.

00:01:13.373 --> 00:01:14.674
So, to my little kids,

00:01:14.674 --> 00:01:17.410 align:start size:81% position:19%
now it's Uncle
Tony and Aunt Tim.

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:19.779
You know, they're awesome.

00:01:19.779 --> 00:01:21.815
They're just the best dudes.

00:01:21.815 --> 00:01:25.652
Their wedding is why
you should always go,

00:01:25.652 --> 00:01:28.888
if invited, to a gay wedding.

00:01:28.888 --> 00:01:30.557
It is fabulous!

00:01:30.557 --> 00:01:32.759
(crowd laughs)

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:36.029
I was amazed at how
gay it really was.

00:01:36.029 --> 00:01:38.264
Like, I thought it'd be
gay, but not gay-gay,

00:01:38.264 --> 00:01:40.667
but it was way gay.

00:01:40.667 --> 00:01:43.670 align:start size:97% position:3%
They had, like, Cirque Du
So-gay, and guys flying down

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:45.672 align:start size:94% position:6%
and making out with dudes
and tweaking nipples

00:01:45.672 --> 00:01:47.841
and flying back up; crazy.

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:54.414 align:start size:84% position:16%
My daughter was in the
wedding procession.

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:59.886
My wife was handling her and
I was sitting with my son,

00:01:59.886 --> 00:02:02.789
August, who was
four at the time.

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:05.458
And you know how at weddings,

00:02:05.458 --> 00:02:08.128 align:start size:88% position:13%
how they have
entertainment, usually?

00:02:08.128 --> 00:02:10.897 align:start size:88% position:13%
You know, for the actual
ceremony, they have

00:02:10.897 --> 00:02:14.968
like the fat girl cousin of the
bride will come out and sing

00:02:14.968 --> 00:02:17.470 align:start size:84% position:16%
that horrible song
from Frozen, you know?

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:18.404
(crowd laughs)

00:02:18.404 --> 00:02:19.239
You know?

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:21.774
But like, it started off

00:02:21.774 --> 00:02:23.610
with a five minute
long rambling story

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:26.779 align:start size:94% position:6%
about how she went out one
time with ya'll bowling

00:02:26.779 --> 00:02:28.047
and then ya'll had pizza,

00:02:28.047 --> 00:02:29.482
and ya'll shared the
last piece of pizza,

00:02:29.482 --> 00:02:31.551 align:start size:84% position:16%
and that's what
true love really is.

00:02:31.551 --> 00:02:32.986
(crowd laughs)

00:02:32.986 --> 00:02:35.722 align:start size:97% position:3%
And you're just like, "let's
go big girl, let's go!

00:02:35.722 --> 00:02:37.590
Wrap it up, biggie!

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:40.260 align:start size:97% position:3%
Let's go! That open bar ain't
gonna drink itself, baby

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:41.528
Let's do this!"

00:02:43.429 --> 00:02:44.264
And, uh...

00:02:48.334 --> 00:02:51.004
Either that, or it's like...

00:02:51.004 --> 00:02:53.273 align:start size:84% position:16%
like a retarded,
might be retarded kid,

00:02:53.273 --> 00:02:54.874 align:start size:84% position:16%
playing the trumpet
with a boner.

00:02:54.874 --> 00:02:56.042
You know what I mean, you know?

00:02:56.042 --> 00:02:58.144
(crowd laughs)

00:02:58.144 --> 00:03:01.181 align:start size:97% position:3%
I bet Timmy loves his
trumpet, don't look at that.

00:03:01.181 --> 00:03:04.851 align:start size:94% position:6%
Woo! That boy is musically
inclined, Lord Jesus.

00:03:04.851 --> 00:03:07.287
Oh, that's a hog, that boy...

00:03:08.888 --> 00:03:12.292 align:start size:84% position:16%
Anyways, they didn't
have that, okay?

00:03:12.292 --> 00:03:16.396
They had a six-foot four,
black male transvestite

00:03:16.396 --> 00:03:18.898
Cher impersonator named Sugar.

00:03:20.033 --> 00:03:21.367
With a C-H, hey!

00:03:24.037 --> 00:03:24.871
Mr. Chugar

00:03:26.539 --> 00:03:29.209
was six-foot four, okay?

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:32.512 align:start size:84% position:16%
That's quite a
striking Cher, okay?

00:03:32.512 --> 00:03:34.747
But, my man had eight-inch

00:03:35.882 --> 00:03:39.285 align:start size:84% position:16%
platform boots on with
fishnet stockings,

00:03:39.285 --> 00:03:42.088 align:start size:84% position:16%
garter belt, a
bustier, and a cape.

00:03:42.088 --> 00:03:44.324
(crowd laughs)

00:03:44.324 --> 00:03:46.759
'Cause for a black man
looking just like Cher,

00:03:46.759 --> 00:03:48.995
wasn't quite gay enough.

00:03:48.995 --> 00:03:51.331
My man added the cape, nice!

00:03:55.168 --> 00:03:56.002
My son

00:03:56.869 --> 00:03:59.205
had a lot of questions.

00:03:59.205 --> 00:04:02.342
(crowd laughs)

00:04:02.342 --> 00:04:04.177
"Daddy, what is that?"

00:04:05.545 --> 00:04:07.880
That son, is a transvestite.

00:04:09.082 --> 00:04:12.485
"Woo! That's a big ol'
transmesmite, daddy."

00:04:14.487 --> 00:04:18.658
Yeah. Yeah, son that's about
as big as I reckon they come.

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:22.262
"Yeah, that's a biggun'.

00:04:22.262 --> 00:04:25.665 align:start size:84% position:16%
Biggest one I ever
seen, dad, biggest one

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:29.435
Transmesmites is big, dad."

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:32.572
Yeah, amen to that.

00:04:35.108 --> 00:04:38.211
And he saw that Chugar
was wearing that cape,

00:04:38.211 --> 00:04:39.646
and he was like,

00:04:39.646 --> 00:04:43.283 align:start size:97% position:3%
"Daddy, you think Mr. Chugar
likes sword-fighting?"

00:04:43.283 --> 00:04:46.452 align:start size:72% position:28%
(laughs)
(crowd laughs)

00:04:46.452 --> 00:04:47.620
I bet he does!

00:04:49.822 --> 00:04:51.858
What was funny was all the
gay guys around us like,

00:04:51.858 --> 00:04:54.627
"we like sword-fighting,
too, you know what I mean?"

00:04:54.627 --> 00:04:56.863 align:start size:97% position:3%
My son was like, "man,
these a bunch of cool dudes

00:04:56.863 --> 00:04:58.364
right here, man.

00:04:58.364 --> 00:04:59.966
I like these guys."

00:05:01.601 --> 00:05:04.470 align:start size:81% position:19%
So, Chugar started
singing, right?

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:05.738
And my man was killing it.

00:05:05.738 --> 00:05:06.806
I'm not even gonna lie.

00:05:06.806 --> 00:05:08.708
(howls like a dog)

00:05:08.708 --> 00:05:11.511
I don't know the words,
she just sounds like a

00:05:11.511 --> 00:05:13.046
Bluetick hound dog to me,

00:05:13.046 --> 00:05:17.016
so he sounded like one, so
I'm like, "he must be on."

00:05:17.016 --> 00:05:20.720 align:start size:84% position:16%
And half way through
his performance,

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:23.523 align:start size:84% position:16%
his big ol' dick
and one of his balls

00:05:23.523 --> 00:05:26.359
fell out of his britches.

00:05:26.359 --> 00:05:27.193
Yeah!

00:05:30.296 --> 00:05:34.467 align:start size:97% position:3%
My son goes, "Daddy, Mr.
Chugar got a big ol' pee pee!"

00:05:35.635 --> 00:05:38.971 align:start size:88% position:13%
No son, you and I got
pee pees, that's a dick.

00:05:38.971 --> 00:05:41.441 align:start size:72% position:28%
It's big.
(crowd laughs)

00:05:41.441 --> 00:05:44.444
Had an elbow in it,
Lord Jesus; big.

00:05:50.083 --> 00:05:51.317
And that's when August goes,

00:05:51.317 --> 00:05:54.354
"yep, transmesmites
gots dicks, dad."

00:05:55.955 --> 00:05:59.092 align:start size:88% position:13%
That's a life lesson,
son, you listen to that.

00:05:59.092 --> 00:06:00.460
You hold that with you,

00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:02.195
that could save your
life one day, son.

00:06:02.195 --> 00:06:03.529
(crowd laughs)

00:06:03.529 --> 00:06:06.065
"Transmesmites gots dicks."

00:06:06.065 --> 00:06:07.333
Amen son, amen.

00:06:09.235 --> 00:06:13.973 align:start size:84% position:16%
What I was amazed is
how professional Mr.
Chugar was, okay?

00:06:13.973 --> 00:06:15.708
That thing falls out,

00:06:16.843 --> 00:06:20.446
my man is obviously
panicked, turns,

00:06:20.446 --> 00:06:23.950
gets his pocketbook,
rips off some tape,

00:06:23.950 --> 00:06:27.086
puts his junk back
up in his britches,

00:06:27.086 --> 00:06:28.888
and finishes the song.

00:06:29.756 --> 00:06:33.059
(howls like a dog)

00:06:33.059 --> 00:06:35.328
I was like, "Genius!"

00:06:35.328 --> 00:06:37.196
That was impressive.

00:06:37.196 --> 00:06:40.333 align:start size:84% position:16%
That was impressive,
think about that.

00:06:40.333 --> 00:06:43.903
Ladies, half way through
one of your performances,

00:06:43.903 --> 00:06:46.739 align:start size:81% position:19%
one of your 'giner
lips falls out.

00:06:47.940 --> 00:06:50.543
You're not going
to be so composed.

00:06:50.543 --> 00:06:52.011
You're not going
to tuck it back in,

00:06:52.011 --> 00:06:53.446
you're not going to
go, "don't judge,

00:06:53.446 --> 00:06:55.848
I've made a lot of bad
choices in college."

00:06:55.848 --> 00:06:57.183
(crowd laughs)

00:06:57.183 --> 00:06:58.451
You know?

00:06:58.451 --> 00:07:01.354
Once that's out, the
show is over, right?

00:07:01.354 --> 00:07:05.591
Not Chugar, went on and
did it, and nailed it.

00:07:05.591 --> 00:07:07.260 align:start size:84% position:16%
The ceremony went
off without a hitch.

00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:10.997 align:start size:84% position:16%
The reception though,
that was awesome.

00:07:10.997 --> 00:07:13.166
Those gay boys went all out.

00:07:13.166 --> 00:07:15.568
Hundred cases of
French champagne.

00:07:15.568 --> 00:07:16.836
Prime rib stations.

00:07:16.836 --> 00:07:19.038
Seafood station, just
grab a lobster, what?

00:07:19.038 --> 00:07:19.872
Okay?

00:07:21.207 --> 00:07:24.877 align:start size:97% position:3%
Real sushi bar with
bonafide Japanesy Japaneses.

00:07:26.045 --> 00:07:26.879
Real.

00:07:27.814 --> 00:07:29.415
Real.

00:07:29.415 --> 00:07:32.285 align:start size:94% position:6%
Not like you get in
Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

00:07:32.285 --> 00:07:35.321
It's some white guy
squinting, you know?

00:07:35.321 --> 00:07:36.422
This is real.

00:07:37.457 --> 00:07:38.758
Real.

00:07:38.758 --> 00:07:41.360
(crowd laughs)

00:07:42.829 --> 00:07:46.632
I almost got tea-bagged on
the way back to our table.

00:07:46.632 --> 00:07:50.069 align:start size:97% position:3%
They had these risers on each
corner of the dance floor

00:07:50.069 --> 00:07:54.106 align:start size:94% position:6%
and up there was basically
a naked man, okay?

00:07:54.106 --> 00:07:57.844 align:start position:0%
I mean, he was wearing the
g-string, but a tiny one, okay?

00:07:57.844 --> 00:08:00.646
And he was way bigger
than that, okay my man?

00:08:00.646 --> 00:08:03.716 align:start size:97% position:3%
Puerto Rican g-string
according to the flag on it.

00:08:03.716 --> 00:08:05.518
(crowd laughs)

00:08:05.518 --> 00:08:08.788
And my man was just
shakin' it, just...

00:08:10.189 --> 00:08:12.525
I'm talking to my wife.

00:08:12.525 --> 00:08:15.361
As we're walking,
a state, a light,

00:08:15.361 --> 00:08:18.030
hits a sequence, goes
into my periphery,

00:08:18.030 --> 00:08:19.966
and I go, "whoa, nuts!"

00:08:21.334 --> 00:08:22.935
I Matrix-ed nuts!

00:08:22.935 --> 00:08:25.638
(crowd laughs)

00:08:25.638 --> 00:08:27.673
Quite possibly, the
most athletic move

00:08:27.673 --> 00:08:30.109
I've made in the last 30 years.

00:08:30.109 --> 00:08:33.412
Not gonna lie to you, it
was pretty impressive.

00:08:33.412 --> 00:08:35.681
'Cause that's not my luck.

00:08:35.681 --> 00:08:39.318 align:start size:84% position:16%
My luck is to have the
full tea-bag and...

00:08:39.318 --> 00:08:43.189
Me go, "Sir, will you get
it off my face, please?"

00:08:43.189 --> 00:08:46.259
He's Puerto Rican, I
smell plantains, okay?

00:08:46.259 --> 00:08:47.927
That's my luck.

00:08:47.927 --> 00:08:49.762
We get to the table,

00:08:49.762 --> 00:08:53.599 align:start size:84% position:16%
and right by our
name are three pills.

00:08:53.599 --> 00:08:55.968
And my wife goes,
"is that candy?"

00:08:55.968 --> 00:08:57.937
And I'm like, "honey,
I'm pretty sure I know

00:08:57.937 --> 00:08:59.505
every candy ever made.

00:08:59.505 --> 00:09:02.108
(crowd laughs)

00:09:03.276 --> 00:09:05.611
And I don't know what
those first two are,

00:09:05.611 --> 00:09:08.781 align:start size:97% position:3%
but that last one looks like
pharmaceutical-grade MDMA

00:09:08.781 --> 00:09:10.449
from the early 90s."

00:09:14.020 --> 00:09:16.222
And my wife goes, "What's MDMA?"

00:09:16.222 --> 00:09:18.524
And I go, "That's ecstasy."

00:09:18.524 --> 00:09:21.961
And she goes, "(laughs),
yeah, you remember that,

00:09:21.961 --> 00:09:23.296
don't you? Yeah"

00:09:25.898 --> 00:09:28.534
A different gay guy comes out

00:09:28.534 --> 00:09:32.004
and he's like the gay
guy in charge, okay?

00:09:32.004 --> 00:09:35.608
And he's like, "Hello,
party people, hello!

00:09:37.043 --> 00:09:40.246
Tonight, baby, we're going
to party to 3 AM, baby!"

00:09:40.246 --> 00:09:41.747
It was 7:20, Jack.

00:09:43.215 --> 00:09:45.551 align:start size:84% position:16%
It was 7:20, my
man's calling three?

00:09:45.551 --> 00:09:47.920
I don't think so, okay.

00:09:47.920 --> 00:09:50.423 align:start size:88% position:13%
"Tonight baby, we're
all going to Wonderland,

00:09:50.423 --> 00:09:51.757
just like Alice.

00:09:53.159 --> 00:09:56.295
Everyone, at your table,
you have three pills, baby.

00:09:56.295 --> 00:09:58.965
One will make you small,
one will make you taller,

00:09:58.965 --> 00:10:02.001
and one is a little
Goldilocks pill,

00:10:02.001 --> 00:10:04.904
'cause just like Diego, it
makes everything alright.

00:10:04.904 --> 00:10:07.340
(crowd laughs)

00:10:07.340 --> 00:10:09.875
So let's take these
pills, okay, baby?

00:10:09.875 --> 00:10:12.211
On three, everybody!

00:10:12.211 --> 00:10:14.280
One, two, three!

00:10:14.280 --> 00:10:15.681
oh!"

00:10:15.681 --> 00:10:17.149
(crowd laughs)

00:10:17.149 --> 00:10:19.118
My wife's like, "should
we take these pills?"

00:10:19.118 --> 00:10:20.386
Fuck yes!

00:10:20.386 --> 00:10:21.887
(crowd laughs)

00:10:21.887 --> 00:10:24.523
These are gay drugs, you're
damn right we're taking these

00:10:24.523 --> 00:10:27.393
these the best drugs they make.

00:10:27.393 --> 00:10:28.894
Nobody was seated to my left.

00:10:28.894 --> 00:10:32.131
I grabbed them pills, did
'em too, fuck it, right?

00:10:32.131 --> 00:10:33.966
Where I'm from, if you're
gonna dance with the devil,

00:10:33.966 --> 00:10:35.735
you might as well lead,
you know what I'm saying?

00:10:35.735 --> 00:10:36.902
Let's do this.

00:10:38.437 --> 00:10:40.573
I'll tell you, man...

00:10:40.573 --> 00:10:43.576
Whatever it was, it worked.

00:10:43.576 --> 00:10:44.677
(crowd laughs)

00:10:44.677 --> 00:10:47.179
It worked phenomenal.

00:10:47.179 --> 00:10:49.615
20 minutes later, I was
sitting there wondering,

00:10:49.615 --> 00:10:54.320
that if the nucleus of an
atom was a big as a car,

00:10:54.320 --> 00:10:56.522
that nucleus could
be in Los Angeles;

00:10:56.522 --> 00:10:57.857
yet the electron

00:10:59.291 --> 00:11:02.028 align:start size:84% position:16%
that orbits it would
be in New York.

00:11:02.028 --> 00:11:06.198
That's how much distance
is in an atom, comparable.

00:11:07.733 --> 00:11:10.636 align:start size:88% position:13%
But yet, we just
learned in physics that,

00:11:10.636 --> 00:11:14.907
that electron, which should
be a static negative charge,

00:11:14.907 --> 00:11:16.942
'cause it's always orbiting,

00:11:16.942 --> 00:11:19.845
keeping a constant
positive neutral.

00:11:19.845 --> 00:11:22.381 align:start size:84% position:16%
Makes sense in a
stable element, right?

00:11:22.381 --> 00:11:24.717
But no, physics have found that,

00:11:24.717 --> 00:11:28.888 align:start size:97% position:3%
that electron dips throughout
dimensions in and out,

00:11:30.289 --> 00:11:34.260
so it can pop up in New York,
or Mexico City, or Hawaii.

00:11:34.260 --> 00:11:37.630
It's amazing, it's amazing that,

00:11:37.630 --> 00:11:39.198
that might be the thread

00:11:39.198 --> 00:11:42.068 align:start position:0%
that holds us to this
dimension, it's those electrons.

00:11:42.068 --> 00:11:45.538 align:start size:88% position:13%
That's what I thought
was going on in my head.

00:11:45.538 --> 00:11:48.307
Turns out, I was just
tweaking my nipple,

00:11:48.307 --> 00:11:51.744
holding my junk, dancing
to Ke$ha in the corner.

00:11:51.744 --> 00:11:55.414
(crowd laughs and applauds)

00:12:00.619 --> 00:12:01.520
Good times.

00:12:03.656 --> 00:12:08.027 align:start position:0%
We went to 3:40, Diego was
right, it was a hell of a party.

00:12:08.027 --> 00:12:10.129
It was a hell of a party.

00:12:11.497 --> 00:12:15.668 align:start size:97% position:3%
So glad I went, don't be
homophobic, no need, you know?

00:12:16.836 --> 00:12:18.704
I know that, but
it's kind of nice

00:12:18.704 --> 00:12:20.940 align:start size:84% position:16%
to be an ambassador
for my accent,

00:12:20.940 --> 00:12:23.008
'cause every gay man thinks that

00:12:23.008 --> 00:12:25.311 align:start size:84% position:16%
everybody talks
like me hates them.

00:12:25.311 --> 00:12:29.148 align:start size:88% position:13%
Couldn't be farther from
the truth, you know?

00:12:29.148 --> 00:12:32.418 align:start size:84% position:16%
They were, it was
impressive, you know?

00:12:34.186 --> 00:12:35.454
I'm glad I could
be there for that,

00:12:35.454 --> 00:12:37.356
because I used to
be dumb, you know?

00:12:37.356 --> 00:12:39.792
Back when I was a troglodyte.

00:12:42.428 --> 00:12:44.263
I used to think that the
worst thing in the world

00:12:44.263 --> 00:12:46.532
would be having a
gay man hit on me.

00:12:46.532 --> 00:12:48.534
You know what's way
worse than that?

00:12:48.534 --> 00:12:51.837
Having 300 gay men on
ecstasy not hit on you.

00:12:51.837 --> 00:12:53.005
(crowd laughs)

00:12:53.005 --> 00:12:53.839
Yeah.

00:12:55.541 --> 00:12:56.375
Yeah.

00:12:57.610 --> 00:13:00.312
That sets it up, right there.

00:13:00.312 --> 00:13:01.747
Thanks guys, ya'll been fun.

00:13:01.747 --> 00:13:03.215
I'm Ralphie May, good
night, bye bye, ya'll.

00:13:03.215 --> 00:13:04.850
(crowd cheers)

00:13:04.850 --> 00:13:07.787
