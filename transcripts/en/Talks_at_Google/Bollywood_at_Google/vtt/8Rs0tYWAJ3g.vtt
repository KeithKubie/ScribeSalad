00:00:02.890 --> 00:00:05.730
SPEAKER: So first of all, I
want to welcome all of you.

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:08.604
If you have hummed
even a handful of songs

00:00:08.604 --> 00:00:10.270
over the last couple
of decades, there's

00:00:10.270 --> 00:00:14.980
a 99% chance that one of those
songs were sung by Sunidhi.

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:16.800
She began singing
when she was four.

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:19.730
And there was nothing ruki
ruki about her, Sunidhi,

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:22.760
once she started singing
as a four-year-old,

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:26.710
but then also later
in 1999 for "Mast."

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:29.720
She has been nominated
for a total of 81 awards,

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:33.907
including 14 Filmfare
and 14 IIFA awards.

00:00:33.907 --> 00:00:35.740
And I wish, Sunidhi,
you brought the picture

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:37.290
of your mantle piece
because we sure

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:39.081
would like to see how
it looks like to have

00:00:39.081 --> 00:00:41.030
22 of those awards on there.

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:42.650
Sunidhi, it's my
absolute pleasure

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:43.810
to have you here at Google.

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:45.351
Thank you so much
for making the time

00:00:45.351 --> 00:00:46.809
despite having to sing tonight.

00:00:46.809 --> 00:00:49.225
SUNIDHI CHAUHAN: Thank you for
the wonderful introduction.

00:00:49.225 --> 00:00:51.600
Thanks so much.

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.680
SPEAKER: So we were lucky enough
to be on the route of your tour

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:56.840
that you're doing in North
America with Shri Balaji

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:58.240
Entertainment.

00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:00.470
You were singing in
San Jose yesterday.

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:02.880
Tell us a little bit more
about your upcoming events

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:06.140
and how this tour has
been turning out for you.

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:08.190
SUNIDHI CHAUHAN: This
tour has been fantastic.

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:14.590
I mean, we've performed
in LA, San Jose.

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:17.390
I've lost track already.

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:21.481
Orlando, Houston,
and one more city.

00:01:21.481 --> 00:01:21.980
Where?

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:22.740
OK.

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:25.850
So basically, we've
had fantastic shows.

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:29.170
And the kind of response I've
received from the audience,

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:31.240
the love, the affection,
is incredible,

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:32.930
has been incredible.

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:36.740
And the last time I came
here in San Jose to perform,

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:39.380
it was one of the most
memorable times for me.

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:44.960
And when I performed last
night, it was even more magical.

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:49.220
So thank you so much for making
this so special each time.

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:50.105
That's all I can say.

00:01:50.105 --> 00:01:51.985
SPEAKER: OK, thank you
so much for coming.

00:01:51.985 --> 00:01:53.693
SUNIDHI CHAUHAN: And
my forthcoming shows

00:01:53.693 --> 00:01:57.910
are going to be in Dallas,
Seattle, and Vancouver.

00:01:57.910 --> 00:02:00.260
And then we're done
with this tour.

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:02.811
I'm going back
home after a month.

00:02:02.811 --> 00:02:04.810
SPEAKER: It sounds like
you can't wait for that.

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:06.760
SUNIDHI CHAUHAN: It's not that.

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:09.810
It takes so much from me.

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:11.850
My shows take a
lot of hard work.

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:16.160
And all the effort that has
gone in there, me and my band,

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:17.120
is humongous.

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:19.552
So we get tired.

00:02:19.552 --> 00:02:20.510
It's as simple as that.

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:22.100
SPEAKER: Absolutely.

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:25.950
You started singing at a
very early age of four.

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:29.415
But then also in terms of your
career, you started that at 13.

00:02:29.415 --> 00:02:29.915
Right?

00:02:29.915 --> 00:02:30.820
SUNIDHI CHAUHAN: 11.

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:32.530
SPEAKER: 11, even younger.

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:36.790
What does go on in the
mind of 11-year-old?

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:39.500
Does she know she's
building a career?

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:41.010
Is she following
someone's advice?

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:43.093
Or is she just following
her passion at that time?

00:02:43.093 --> 00:02:45.730
SUNIDHI CHAUHAN: Nothing goes
on in one's mind actually.

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:48.370
It's just I was like
a tape recorder.

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:50.670
Dad used to ask me to sing.

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:52.650
I would sing and then head home.

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:54.150
That's all I knew.

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:55.960
My job was to sing.

00:02:55.960 --> 00:03:03.280
So I would never take the
credit for being who I am.

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:05.670
My dad struggled on my behalf.

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:11.370
He gave his life, his career,
his everything because of me.

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:12.570
And he gave up everything.

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:16.280
And I am what I am
because of his sacrifice.

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:21.680
So yeah, but then by the
time I got a little famous

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:24.480
and had a lot of
songs to my credit,

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:26.380
then my struggle started.

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:30.690
Then I had to
maintain what I had.

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:35.600
I had to keep going
strong and stronger.

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:38.620
Each time I sang a song, it used
to be like a new song to me.

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:41.440
I used to treat it
like my first ever.

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:43.130
And that's how it happens.

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:45.800
That's how you should
treat your work.

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:49.890
And another thing is
that, thankfully, I

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:51.460
am in love with my job.

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:53.651
It's not a job for me.

00:03:53.651 --> 00:03:55.740
It was a hobby when it started.

00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:58.160
And it turned into a profession.

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:00.880
When it did, I don't
even come to know.

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:02.520
So I'm glad that I'm
doing what I love.

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:04.020
SPEAKER: We can
tell from your work.

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:06.660
It doesn't look like-- it
looks effortless despite there

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:07.550
being so much effort.

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:09.190
SUNIDHI CHAUHAN:
Thank you so much.

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:11.921
SPEAKER: So you have sung in
many different genres of songs.

00:04:11.921 --> 00:04:12.420
Right?

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:15.000
You have sung a very
folk-based "Bumbro."

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.680
You have also sung a very
racy "Sheila Ki Jawani."

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:20.029
How do you bring that much
breadth into your singing?

00:04:20.029 --> 00:04:21.664
And do you prepare
at all for that?

00:04:21.664 --> 00:04:23.080
Like we have heard
that Amir Khan,

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:25.560
for example, when he
prepares for his movies,

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:28.330
he tries to live that
character for many, many months

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:29.190
beforehand.

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:31.720
SUNIDHI CHAUHAN: Yes, a
little in my head, but in five

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:33.880
minutes because
there is no time.

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:36.060
Maybe for a movie,
to act in a movie,

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:37.490
you still have time to prepare.

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:40.920
But for people like us,
we go to the studio,

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:45.550
learn the song in about 10, 15
minutes, and we are on the mic.

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:48.410
So it's a very fast process.

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:50.267
But we are used to it.

00:04:50.267 --> 00:04:50.892
SPEAKER: Great.

00:04:50.892 --> 00:04:53.266
And out of all these different
genres that you have sung,

00:04:53.266 --> 00:04:54.300
what is your favorite?

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:56.300
If you had to make
a song on your life,

00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:57.740
what genre would that be?

00:04:57.740 --> 00:04:59.490
SUNIDHI CHAUHAN: I'm
yet to find that out.

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:02.700
I don't know honestly.

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:05.660
I have thought about
composing actually.

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:06.225
Maybe yeah.

00:05:06.225 --> 00:05:08.690
Thank you so much for the idea.

00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:12.640
I would like to write my
own music maybe someday

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:14.010
if you would like to hear it.

00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:16.130
SPEAKER: I would
love to hear that.

00:05:16.130 --> 00:05:18.832
SUNIDHI CHAUHAN: But
sometimes, you're a singer.

00:05:18.832 --> 00:05:20.540
They just want to
listen to your singing.

00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:23.620
They don't want to hear your
songs that you've written.

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:25.320
So it's good.

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:27.270
I would love to
explore that area.

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:28.110
Yeah.

00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:29.840
SPEAKER: I would
love to hear it.

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:33.500
And we found out a
little bit about your-- I

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:37.320
have one last question
actually about your success

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:38.139
outside of India.

00:05:38.139 --> 00:05:40.430
So obviously, you have reached
the pinnacles of success

00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:41.170
in Bollywood.

00:05:41.170 --> 00:05:44.550
You've just done many, many
songs in many, many movies

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:45.970
and outside of movies.

00:05:45.970 --> 00:05:50.070
So after that, you have had a
stint also outside of India.

00:05:50.070 --> 00:05:54.540
You sang a song along Enrique
Iglesias in 2010, "Heartbeat."

00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:56.570
Tell us a little bit
about that and if you

00:05:56.570 --> 00:05:59.540
have any future plans of
doing more outside of India

00:05:59.540 --> 00:06:01.650
engagements.

00:06:01.650 --> 00:06:04.970
SUNIDHI CHAUHAN: I am
open to collaborations.

00:06:04.970 --> 00:06:09.150
With this song, with
Enrique, it just came to me.

00:06:09.150 --> 00:06:10.570
And I got excited.

00:06:10.570 --> 00:06:12.290
Thankfully, there
was enough scope

00:06:12.290 --> 00:06:18.970
in the song to blend some
Indian element into that song.

00:06:18.970 --> 00:06:19.610
So we did it.

00:06:19.610 --> 00:06:21.320
And it sounded good.

00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:24.490
Otherwise, it always
sounds a little off

00:06:24.490 --> 00:06:28.100
when you try to push something
which is probably not meant

00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:30.830
for that kind of music.

00:06:30.830 --> 00:06:33.180
But it just worked.

00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:39.010
The folk and the pop song,
it just blended together.

00:06:39.010 --> 00:06:42.890
I mean, this is for all my
fans and who like my work.

00:06:42.890 --> 00:06:45.550
I recently acted
in a short film.

00:06:45.550 --> 00:06:47.710
And it was a great experience.

00:06:47.710 --> 00:06:49.870
So go check it
out when it's out.

00:06:49.870 --> 00:06:50.370
That's all.

00:06:50.370 --> 00:06:52.180
It's called "Playing Priya."

00:06:52.180 --> 00:06:52.990
It's a short film.

00:06:52.990 --> 00:06:56.880
It's only going to be released
on the digital platform.

00:06:56.880 --> 00:06:58.450
So you can check it online.

00:06:58.450 --> 00:07:02.124
And please feel free to comment.

00:07:02.124 --> 00:07:03.040
If you like it, great.

00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:05.610
If you don't like it,
please, all the more comment.

00:07:05.610 --> 00:07:07.735
I would like to know.

00:07:07.735 --> 00:07:10.360
SPEAKER: And as you can imagine,
we are very active on YouTube.

00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:11.151
So we will comment.

00:07:11.151 --> 00:07:12.340
SUNIDHI CHAUHAN: Yes, great.

00:07:12.340 --> 00:07:12.950
Thank you.

00:07:12.950 --> 00:07:13.370
Thank you again.

00:07:13.370 --> 00:07:14.161
SPEAKER: Thank you.

00:07:14.161 --> 00:07:16.680
[APPLAUSE]
