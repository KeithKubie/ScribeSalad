00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:04.160
On the snow capped mountains of Venus there
is no actual snow as we know it.

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:06.550
Because it snows metal.

00:00:06.550 --> 00:00:11.600
And the Lepsis is a designer kitchen pod to
grow your own insects to eat.

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:17.640
Vsauce, Kevin here... this is Mind Blow.

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:22.500
A professor at University of Nottingham, has
discovered a new human body part, a sixth

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:23.820
layer of the cornea.

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:28.710
He is calling it Dua's layer, after himself,
and the discovery means that ophthalmology

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:33.930
textbooks will have to be re-written and clinicians
around the world are already beginning to

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:37.870
relate many diseases to the discovery of this
new layer.

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:40.500
Chinese construction firm Broad Sustainable
Building has been given the go ahead to create

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:44.170
the world's tallest skyscraper called Sky
City.

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:52.249
It is a 220 story, 2,750 foot tall and when
finished will be the size of a small city.

00:00:52.249 --> 00:00:58.789
It'll have 104 elevators and a six mile ramp
that can lead 30,000 people towards the school,

00:00:58.789 --> 00:00:59.789
hospital, and housing.

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:03.620
&nbsp;And they also plan to construct it in only
seven months!

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:08.500
WiSee is an interaction interface that is
able to recognize human gestures throughout

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:09.610
the home.

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:15.001
Using WiFi and a few mobile devices WiSee
can identify gestures in line of sight, non

00:01:15.001 --> 00:01:17.930
line of sight, and through the wall scenarios.

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:24.310
The prototype was able to identify and classify
a set of nine gestures with a 94% accuracy.

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:34.140
And they see it being used to control music,
TV, lights and heating anywhere in the home.

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:38.340
Lego is working with Sony to create toys that
are more like video games to keep younger

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:39.340
kids interested.

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:43.560
Though it's still in the planning phases some
of the ideas are to have the Lego pieces mounted

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.810
to small motors and cameras.

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:49.530
The tiny device is controlled with a video
game controller and the enemy devices are

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:50.780
controlled by a computer.

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:55.110
They are woking with having the cameras linked
to a smart device so you can see what your

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:59.110
piece is seeing and are also developing parts
and pieces that can be ejected or blown up.

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:00.210
Worlds oldest primate fossil ever found and
it was the size of a mousee.

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:05.440
University of Minnesota's Biomedical engineering
professor Bin He created a non invasive brain

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:10.829
computer interface that allows the user to
control a robot using only their mind.

00:02:10.829 --> 00:02:16.590
Seen here being guided around a gym, turning,
rising, and even flying through balloon rings.

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:21.560
The hope is to use the technology for those
with neurodegenerative diseases to regain

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:25.220
function by controlling artificial limbs or
other devices.

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:31.170
A new reversible male contraceptive proven
effective in mice testicles involves injecting

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:33.980
gold nano rods and heating them up.

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:34.980
So Yeah.

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:39.969
DARPA has created new nerve and muscle interfaces
that can can be controlled directly though

00:02:39.969 --> 00:02:42.400
amputees existing nerves.

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:47.740
The project is called RE-NET, Reliable Neural-Interface
Technology and they are hoping not only to

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:52.269
create high performance interfaces that are
reliable, they want to provide sensory feedback

00:02:52.269 --> 00:02:54.859
that would also give the user the ability
to feel.

00:02:54.859 --> 00:02:58.000
Basically, allowing users to directly control
prosthetics with their existing nerves.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.129
The Emperor 1510 LX is a $21,500 dollar high
tech work station.

00:03:01.129 --> 00:03:06.389
It has a retractable monitor stand that can
hold five monitors, a reclining italian leather

00:03:06.389 --> 00:03:10.870
seat with thigh rest, Bose sound system, and
a cup holder.

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:16.099
Tokyo has underground bike parking structures
made by a company named Giken that take your

00:03:16.099 --> 00:03:21.129
bike into a cylinder that protects them from
theft, vandalism, and inclement weather.

00:03:21.129 --> 00:03:25.370
Using a magnetic key for access - the door
clamps onto the front wheel of the bike and

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:27.890
takes it underground onto a platform.

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:33.139
Each station is able to hold about 200 bikes
and Giken hopes to create many more in the

00:03:33.139 --> 00:03:37.529
future, but finding enough underground space
in Tokyo could pose a problem.

00:03:37.529 --> 00:03:43.159
Finally, Mike Olbinski shot this incredible
footage of a supercell near Booker, Texas

00:03:43.159 --> 00:04:51.720
I'm going to leave you with Kilobots going
on a picnic and as always thanks for watching.
