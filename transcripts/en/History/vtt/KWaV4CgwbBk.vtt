00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:02.380
- Well, obviously, all we got
here is a chair.

00:00:02.380 --> 00:00:03.790
JERRY: It's a chair.

00:00:03.790 --> 00:00:05.380
One of the most famous
chairs you'll ever see.

00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:06.710
Oh, really?

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:09.000
JERRY: Abraham Lincoln
sat on it while he

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:10.290
was in the White House.

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:11.540
OK.

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:12.790
I'm sure he sat in
a lot of chairs.

00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:20.210
JERRY: It comes from a set of
chairs that was in the White

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:22.710
House while he was president.

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:25.380
I'm asking $2,000
for the chair, that's

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:26.580
the lowest amount
of money and I'm

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:29.000
willing to take for the chair.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:30.830
MAN: That is really neat.

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:32.170
This was in the White House?

00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:33.580
JERRY: It was in the
formal dining room.

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:34.750
MAN: OK.

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:36.080
That's pretty interesting.

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:37.500
I mean, you don't
think about it now,

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:38.540
but the furniture was
a big deal back then.

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:39.420
It was really, really expensive.

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:40.330
JERRY: It was.

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:42.080
MAN: The things people--

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:44.080
you know, well off people did--
they spent money on furniture

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:46.250
and silverware and luxury
items around the house

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:48.330
because there was
no TV at night,

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:49.580
so people entertained
every night.

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:51.250
So those things
were very important.

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:52.880
JERRY: Right.

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:55.040
MAN: Presidential memorabilia
sells for good money.

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:58.380
But Abraham Lincoln,
that's some money.

00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:01.580
So if we can actually tie
this chair to Abraham Lincoln,

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:02.920
there is value here--

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:05.380
serious value.

00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:06.790
You've got
documentation for this?

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:08.290
JERRY: Yes, sir.
MAN: What do you have?

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:10.540
JERRY: One letter is from
the White House telling

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:12.920
the individuals that
they didn't want

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:16.120
the chairs there because
they had too much furniture.

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:19.120
But then I have the original
newspaper clipping where

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:22.120
Robert Todd Lincoln
donated them to a girls'

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:23.790
school up in Vermont.

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:26.080
MAN: OK.

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:28.880
Do you have any other
proof that it's his or--

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:29.960
No.

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:31.460
MAN: OK.

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:33.710
How much were were you
looking to get out of it?

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:34.920
$2,000.

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.290
MAN: $2,000?

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:40.960
Doesn't sound out of the
realm of possibility.

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:45.330
But my problem is
your paperwork.

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:47.290
Do you mind if I call someone
to take a look at them?

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:49.330
He runs the Clark County
Museum system here.

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:51.670
He's an amazing historian.

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:54.500
And he could probably tell
me everything about them.

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:56.750
JERRY: I have no
problem with that.

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:58.250
I'm welcoming the
fact for somebody

00:01:58.250 --> 00:01:59.830
to come and look at the chair.

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:03.620
Any expert that they want
to bring in, bring them on.

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:06.500
MAN: I really want this to
be Abraham Lincoln's chair,

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:09.000
but I'm a little concerned
over his paperwork.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.290
So I called him my friend
Mark to look at this thing.

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:14.420
There's a possibility
that Abraham Lincoln's

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:16.120
butt touched this thing.

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:17.830
[laughter]

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:20.580
MARK: There are high points in
every chair's life, I guess.

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:22.330
When you're dealing
with presidents

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:24.670
of the United States,
nobody has a bigger

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:27.170
name than Abraham Lincoln.

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:31.120
Anything related to Abraham
Lincoln is hugely popular.

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:35.210
So do you have any paperwork
that goes along with this?

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:36.040
JERRY: Yes.

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:37.710
I have this over here.

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:40.710
Let's take a look here.

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:42.170
Oh, OK.

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:43.710
That's a well-known photograph.

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:47.880
This is one of Matthew Brady's
photographs of Lincoln.

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:51.880
It shows this decorative
element right here on the side.

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:56.710
And so when you look at this,
you see this decorative element

00:02:56.710 --> 00:02:59.120
is not the same as this one.

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:04.040
So obviously, this
chair isn't this chair.

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:06.290
Now, the interesting
thing is the chair

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:10.580
that's in this photo is one
that Matthew Brady owned,

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:12.920
not one that Lincoln owned.

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:15.880
Had this been a
match to this, it

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:20.580
would have been highly unlikely
it was ever in the White House.

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:24.710
Now, I tried to pull up
every interior either drawing

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:28.170
or photograph from the
Lincoln period that I can find

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:32.170
and I didn't find this
chair in any of them.

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:35.580
What I couldn't find is
any photographic proof

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:38.580
or drawing proof.

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:44.250
As I read this, we don't
have anything from Lincoln

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:47.080
or from the White House.

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:49.080
The time period is
right on the chairs,

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:53.880
but there's not enough for me
to say that these are ones that

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:55.420
were used in the White House.

00:03:57.920 --> 00:03:59.920
- Thanks.
- Sorry about that.

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:01.290
Thanks, man.

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:03.750
And thank you, and
very interesting to see.

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:04.920
Thanks a lot.
- Thank you.

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:06.460
Appreciate it.

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:09.120
MARK: You need to have
something that actually shows

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:11.380
ownership by Abraham Lincoln.

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:13.080
It's not going to be easy.

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:17.420
But if he can do that, he's
got a really wonderful piece.

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:21.120
MAN: Well, if I buy
something off a customer,

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:22.880
I got to resell it.

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:24.960
When I resell it, it's got to be
beyond a reasonable doubt what

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:26.580
I'm selling is what I'm selling.

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:28.210
It's just the way I do business.

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:33.960
But this point, I can't
make you an offer.

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:37.250
So thanks for coming in,
but I just can't do it.

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:38.420
Thanks for looking at it.

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:39.670
No problem.

00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:41.500
JERRY: You expect these things.

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:44.330
Everything can't be
what you want it to be.

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:46.330
But I believe I brought
in enough evidence

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:49.330
here to prove that this chair
is from the White House.
