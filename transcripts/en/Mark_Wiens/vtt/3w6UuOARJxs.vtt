00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.362
- I hope you're having an
amazing day, it's Mark Wiens.

00:00:02.362 --> 00:00:04.662
I am in Kunming, which is the biggest city

00:00:04.662 --> 00:00:07.740
and the capital city of
Yunnan province in China

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:09.169
and today I'm going to
take you on a Chinese

00:00:09.169 --> 00:00:10.164
street food tour, we're going to eat some

00:00:10.164 --> 00:00:11.801
of the local specialties,

00:00:11.801 --> 00:00:13.865
so I'm excited to share this entire day

00:00:13.865 --> 00:00:15.479
of Chinese street food with you.

00:00:15.479 --> 00:00:18.396
(electronic music)

00:00:23.788 --> 00:00:24.621
- Morning guys,

00:00:24.621 --> 00:00:26.130
I'm in a bit of a rush this morning.

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:27.263
- Let me introduce you to Jerry,

00:00:27.263 --> 00:00:30.035
he's going to be taking us around today.

00:00:30.035 --> 00:00:34.202
It is bright and cold this
morning, it is about 8:45 am.

00:00:36.539 --> 00:00:40.706
(market salespersons speaking Mandarin)

00:00:41.616 --> 00:00:44.051
We have made it to the biggest market

00:00:44.051 --> 00:00:47.777
in downtown Kunming, we've
got to walk through this gate.

00:00:47.777 --> 00:00:50.110
Oh, look at those mushrooms.

00:00:52.546 --> 00:00:53.797
If I come down here I can actually

00:00:53.797 --> 00:00:55.907
smell that mushroomey aroma.

00:00:55.907 --> 00:00:59.037
There's truffles here, there's
some Matsutake mushrooms,

00:00:59.037 --> 00:01:01.896
oh yeah there's, ah, I
remember seeing those before.

00:01:01.896 --> 00:01:04.464
I don't know what most of
these mushrooms are but

00:01:04.464 --> 00:01:06.708
wow you can smell the mushroom aroma.

00:01:06.708 --> 00:01:09.291
(market noise)

00:01:16.254 --> 00:01:19.171
(foreign language)

00:01:21.371 --> 00:01:23.766
- [Jerry] Special type of red--

00:01:23.766 --> 00:01:26.372
- We're stopping first to eat, it's uh,

00:01:26.372 --> 00:01:29.971
well, you can see that
there are bees all over

00:01:29.971 --> 00:01:32.411
and you can, so you can
tell it's something sweet.

00:01:32.411 --> 00:01:34.823
But it looks like rice, there's both

00:01:34.823 --> 00:01:36.533
a pink version and a white version,

00:01:36.533 --> 00:01:38.100
we've got both to try, uh,

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:42.116
I think it's a type of
like fermented rice, sweet.

00:01:42.116 --> 00:01:43.151
How is that?

00:01:43.151 --> 00:01:43.986
- Beautiful.

00:01:43.986 --> 00:01:45.527
- [Mark] Get a little bit of the meat and,

00:01:45.527 --> 00:01:47.107
- [Jerry] Get the liquid, get liquid.

00:01:47.107 --> 00:01:48.607
This is important.

00:01:51.893 --> 00:01:53.784
- Mm, oh yeah.

00:01:53.784 --> 00:01:56.730
It has a little bit of an
alcoholic taste but it's sweet.

00:01:56.730 --> 00:01:58.767
It's kind of like a, a rice pudding,

00:01:58.767 --> 00:02:00.886
but you can still feel the kernels of rice

00:02:00.886 --> 00:02:04.803
and then you've got the
rice wine flavor of it.

00:02:07.532 --> 00:02:09.626
Mm, oh they do have slightly a little

00:02:09.626 --> 00:02:11.329
bit of a different taste.

00:02:11.329 --> 00:02:15.103
I think the red one, is a little sweeter.

00:02:15.103 --> 00:02:18.853
And then the white one
is a little more sour.

00:02:22.214 --> 00:02:24.438
(speaking Mandarin)

00:02:24.438 --> 00:02:26.233
Okay they have some big huge pans

00:02:26.233 --> 00:02:28.480
of spicy chicken feet over here and

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:31.096
people are kind of just
rummaging through them

00:02:31.096 --> 00:02:33.006
picking out chicken feet, um,

00:02:33.006 --> 00:02:34.836
but she's also giving samples, so

00:02:34.836 --> 00:02:38.503
she just handed me a
sample of chicken feet.

00:02:40.446 --> 00:02:43.062
Oh, it's a little cold.

00:02:43.062 --> 00:02:45.707
But, for chicken feet,

00:02:45.707 --> 00:02:47.576
you just sort of gnaw on it,

00:02:47.576 --> 00:02:50.207
you eat all of that cartilagey

00:02:50.207 --> 00:02:52.040
stuff and you can actually kind of crack

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:54.577
through the bones as well.

00:02:54.577 --> 00:02:56.884
Chicken feet have never been my favorite,

00:02:56.884 --> 00:02:58.757
but that sauce is pretty awesomely good.

00:02:58.757 --> 00:03:01.015
It's like lemony, oh you
can see lemon grass in here.

00:03:01.015 --> 00:03:02.566
The flavor is pretty good,

00:03:02.566 --> 00:03:05.204
but yeah it's kind of like a jellyish,

00:03:05.204 --> 00:03:07.454
gelatinous skin in texture.

00:03:13.277 --> 00:03:14.530
There are some little knuckles and

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:15.997
some little bones in that guy.

00:03:15.997 --> 00:03:17.581
Chicken feet are not my personal favorite

00:03:17.581 --> 00:03:21.748
but that sauce, that marinade
was absolutely delicious.

00:03:23.725 --> 00:03:25.108
That's the fish mint, right?

00:03:25.108 --> 00:03:26.691
That looks amazing.

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:30.464
For chili oil, you need
to make that chili oil.

00:03:30.464 --> 00:03:33.464
(speaking Mandarin)

00:03:40.219 --> 00:03:41.486
One of the great things about this market

00:03:41.486 --> 00:03:43.195
is that you can just walk through

00:03:43.195 --> 00:03:45.612
and people offer you samples.

00:03:49.268 --> 00:03:51.179
Oh, that's delicious.

00:03:51.179 --> 00:03:54.238
Those little crunchy
shrimp, they're crunchy,

00:03:54.238 --> 00:03:57.907
nicely salted, you can taste
the chili flavor in there.

00:03:57.907 --> 00:03:59.539
And it's almost like a, oh yeah,

00:03:59.539 --> 00:04:01.165
it tastes like bell peppers.

00:04:01.165 --> 00:04:03.748
(frying sound)

00:04:16.701 --> 00:04:20.214
I saw, I actually heard
the dumplings sizzling

00:04:20.214 --> 00:04:21.710
and this is a type of, it's like a

00:04:21.710 --> 00:04:23.430
half moon shaped dumpling.

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:25.582
He's grilling them, or cooking them over

00:04:25.582 --> 00:04:27.207
the hot griddle and he, first he

00:04:27.207 --> 00:04:28.983
takes the raw dumplings,

00:04:28.983 --> 00:04:31.163
he lays them onto the hot griddle.

00:04:31.163 --> 00:04:32.822
He poured on a little bit of oil

00:04:32.822 --> 00:04:34.144
so they sizzle,

00:04:34.144 --> 00:04:36.902
and so they both cook and
fry sort of at the same time.

00:04:36.902 --> 00:04:38.150
They're hot and fresh.

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:40.050
This looks delicious and smells fantastic.

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:41.523
I think it's mostly filled with,

00:04:41.523 --> 00:04:44.940
I think I can smell some chives in there.

00:04:48.056 --> 00:04:49.950
Oh, that's tasty.

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:52.158
Oh, it's a little bit greasy,

00:04:52.158 --> 00:04:54.775
but, yeah that's mostly chive I think

00:04:54.775 --> 00:04:55.608
and maybe

00:04:57.823 --> 00:04:59.450
I don't know if it's egg inside of it

00:04:59.450 --> 00:05:02.867
and then the wrapper is crispy and gummy.

00:05:04.969 --> 00:05:07.246
Yeah, that's really tasty.

00:05:07.246 --> 00:05:09.579
Mm, nice and salty and oily.

00:05:17.954 --> 00:05:21.353
(foreign language)

00:05:21.353 --> 00:05:23.392
- [Jerry] Okay, yes.

00:05:23.392 --> 00:05:25.914
Oh, this is it, this is her shop.

00:05:25.914 --> 00:05:27.741
She's selling pickles, she wanted to

00:05:27.741 --> 00:05:29.645
see herself in the camera.

00:05:29.645 --> 00:05:32.895
- Oh, she's so friendly, she's so nice.

00:05:35.571 --> 00:05:37.308
And I think right next door we're

00:05:37.308 --> 00:05:40.808
going to try some of the local roast duck.

00:05:41.837 --> 00:05:44.082
- [Jerry] He's the
owner of the duck stall,

00:05:44.082 --> 00:05:45.703
she's the owner of all the pickles.

00:05:45.703 --> 00:05:47.042
- [Mark] Okay.

00:05:47.042 --> 00:05:48.866
Yeah, something I was
really interested to try

00:05:48.866 --> 00:05:51.768
in Yunnan is a local style of roast duck

00:05:51.768 --> 00:05:54.291
which some people say, it compares to the

00:05:54.291 --> 00:05:57.095
one of the most famous roast
duck like from Beijing.

00:05:57.095 --> 00:06:00.262
But this is the local one from Yinyang

00:06:01.101 --> 00:06:04.042
and they're just little small ducks,

00:06:04.042 --> 00:06:05.166
they're roasting them right here.

00:06:05.166 --> 00:06:06.739
It's a busy shop.

00:06:06.739 --> 00:06:09.078
The owner said you have
to buy a whole duck

00:06:09.078 --> 00:06:11.523
but we're going to try
to get a taste test.

00:06:11.523 --> 00:06:13.940
The owner is really friendly.

00:06:18.095 --> 00:06:20.572
On second thought, we have decided that it

00:06:20.572 --> 00:06:23.251
is very necessary to get
ourselves a whole duck.

00:06:23.251 --> 00:06:25.001
They're pretty small.

00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:34.330
The ducks here are selling out so fast.

00:06:36.093 --> 00:06:38.252
Very good, very good, they're
selling out so fast here.

00:06:38.252 --> 00:06:40.732
They're just, like this
whole cabinet was full

00:06:40.732 --> 00:06:43.412
when we arrived here and now
there's only four ducks left.

00:06:43.412 --> 00:06:47.024
She has very kindly
given me a plastic glove

00:06:47.024 --> 00:06:48.733
to taste a piece right now.

00:06:48.733 --> 00:06:52.900
Absolutely beautiful, the skin
is perfectly golden, okay.

00:06:56.053 --> 00:06:56.970
Oh, oh wow.

00:06:58.654 --> 00:07:02.151
- My god, even without
salt, it's good enough.

00:07:02.151 --> 00:07:03.524
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:07:03.524 --> 00:07:05.775
Oh it's so incredibly moist.

00:07:05.775 --> 00:07:08.213
That's unbelievable, it's moist,

00:07:08.213 --> 00:07:11.399
it's not, it's not dry at all.

00:07:11.399 --> 00:07:13.890
Um, the skin is crispy,

00:07:13.890 --> 00:07:15.753
that's really properly good.

00:07:15.753 --> 00:07:17.695
More ducks are coming.

00:07:17.695 --> 00:07:21.778
(techno music and market sounds)

00:07:31.147 --> 00:07:32.697
So as we're standing here eating the duck

00:07:32.697 --> 00:07:34.179
we ran out of ducks and then they took

00:07:34.179 --> 00:07:35.793
a fresh batch out of the oven

00:07:35.793 --> 00:07:38.829
and now they're adding more ducks in.

00:07:38.829 --> 00:07:40.917
And by the way, he told us

00:07:40.917 --> 00:07:43.750
they sell about 700 ducks per day.

00:07:52.886 --> 00:07:56.969
I'm in this just very
tight little, little space.

00:08:04.207 --> 00:08:05.575
That is just sensational

00:08:05.575 --> 00:08:08.477
and there's nothing
better than standing here,

00:08:08.477 --> 00:08:11.052
watching them make it with the ovens

00:08:11.052 --> 00:08:15.219
then freshly chopping it
up and just snacking on it.

00:08:28.225 --> 00:08:29.593
Wow.

00:08:29.593 --> 00:08:33.760
That is really, a seriously
good way to roast a duck.

00:08:36.361 --> 00:08:38.776
It's actually mild in flavor but I think,

00:08:38.776 --> 00:08:40.536
I think what's really keeping me here

00:08:40.536 --> 00:08:42.920
is the actual ducks that they're using

00:08:42.920 --> 00:08:45.301
which do not taste like overly fatty,

00:08:45.301 --> 00:08:48.134
they taste a little more free range.

00:08:48.134 --> 00:08:50.541
The meat is literally not dry at all.

00:08:50.541 --> 00:08:52.319
Like duck can sometimes be.

00:08:52.319 --> 00:08:53.569
Mm, just super.

00:08:58.342 --> 00:09:01.259
(foreign language)

00:09:05.519 --> 00:09:06.519
What a duck.

00:09:13.081 --> 00:09:14.911
Talk about egg decisions.

00:09:14.911 --> 00:09:17.702
There's about a dozen different
eggs you can choose from.

00:09:17.702 --> 00:09:21.369
From free range, from
wild to goose, to duck

00:09:22.245 --> 00:09:25.912
to thousand year, to
transparent, to salted.

00:09:28.400 --> 00:09:30.816
Yeah, they have it all, every type

00:09:30.816 --> 00:09:32.848
of egg you could possibly want.

00:09:32.848 --> 00:09:36.199
(foreign language)

00:09:36.199 --> 00:09:38.091
You can choose your own pear?

00:09:38.091 --> 00:09:38.961
- [Jerry] You can choose your own pear.

00:09:38.961 --> 00:09:39.844
The smaller, the tastier.

00:09:39.844 --> 00:09:40.761
More taste.

00:09:44.416 --> 00:09:46.751
- [Mark] Jerry found some
of these pickled pears

00:09:46.751 --> 00:09:48.546
and they're supposed to
be very good for you,

00:09:48.546 --> 00:09:50.092
very healthy, especially good for your

00:09:50.092 --> 00:09:51.786
digestive system and for your lungs

00:09:51.786 --> 00:09:54.712
and Jerry told me that the smaller ones

00:09:54.712 --> 00:09:57.431
are better, so I got a little small one.

00:09:57.431 --> 00:09:59.929
This is like the size
of a really small plum

00:09:59.929 --> 00:10:02.817
but it's a pear, pickled it's just,

00:10:02.817 --> 00:10:06.150
it's just soaking in its pickled juices.

00:10:09.552 --> 00:10:10.385
Mm, oh.

00:10:13.211 --> 00:10:15.168
It's a little bit of a salty pickle

00:10:15.168 --> 00:10:17.251
but then sweet, oh, okay.

00:10:18.796 --> 00:10:21.145
It's a little bit of a salty pickle,

00:10:21.145 --> 00:10:24.228
the pear has a dryness to it as well.

00:10:28.410 --> 00:10:29.825
- Get some sweet potato.

00:10:29.825 --> 00:10:31.077
- [Mark] Sweet potato.

00:10:31.077 --> 00:10:33.994
(foreign language)

00:10:39.785 --> 00:10:41.535
And really juicy too.

00:10:43.964 --> 00:10:47.131
Micah, Micah, how's that sweet potato?

00:10:49.328 --> 00:10:51.830
I'm not the only one that
is enjoying the market.

00:10:51.830 --> 00:10:53.618
Micah's loving the market

00:10:53.618 --> 00:10:56.248
and this market is huge,
it's a sprawling market,

00:10:56.248 --> 00:10:57.986
it just keeps on going and there's just

00:10:57.986 --> 00:11:00.486
mountains of food to eat here.

00:11:07.339 --> 00:11:08.172
Okay, cool.

00:11:08.172 --> 00:11:09.005
- [Jerry] There you go!

00:11:09.005 --> 00:11:09.838
- Cheers, Jerry.

00:11:09.838 --> 00:11:11.210
Next up at the market, we're trying

00:11:11.210 --> 00:11:13.960
a local Yunnanese beverage drink,

00:11:15.108 --> 00:11:17.574
little rice noodles and then there's also

00:11:17.574 --> 00:11:19.828
some kind of jelly which
he adds to it as well.

00:11:19.828 --> 00:11:22.083
With some syrup and then
she mixes it all up and

00:11:22.083 --> 00:11:23.583
this is the drink.

00:11:24.715 --> 00:11:26.194
Cheers.

00:11:26.194 --> 00:11:28.994
Also, not forgetting, you
get an Angry Birds cup too.

00:11:28.994 --> 00:11:31.244
Which is, which is a bonus.

00:11:35.606 --> 00:11:38.940
Okay, that's, that's really really sweet.

00:11:38.940 --> 00:11:40.395
A little too sweet for me,

00:11:40.395 --> 00:11:43.320
but it tastes like that,
like roasted brown sugar

00:11:43.320 --> 00:11:46.701
type of sweetness, really really jellyish

00:11:46.701 --> 00:11:50.284
jelly that you can suck
up through a straw.

00:11:53.145 --> 00:11:54.645
Totally different.

00:12:02.838 --> 00:12:05.672
There's another noodle shop
that's absolutely bustling

00:12:05.672 --> 00:12:10.032
and there's a specific
type of tofu rice noodle,

00:12:10.032 --> 00:12:12.717
that is very common in
Kunming that we've got to try

00:12:12.717 --> 00:12:15.471
so we're, we're stopping here for one more

00:12:15.471 --> 00:12:17.804
bowl of rice noodles.

00:12:17.804 --> 00:12:20.721
(foreign language)

00:12:39.723 --> 00:12:41.338
- [Jerry] Do like local now, yeah?

00:12:41.338 --> 00:12:42.505
- [Mark] Yeah,

00:12:45.271 --> 00:12:47.398
oh, you can smell the fermented soy beans.

00:12:47.398 --> 00:12:50.560
- [Jerry] Best dish you can ever have.

00:12:50.560 --> 00:12:53.155
- You basically come here
and find an empty stool

00:12:53.155 --> 00:12:55.107
wherever you can find a stool

00:12:55.107 --> 00:12:57.920
and the most famous thing
that you have to try here

00:12:57.920 --> 00:13:01.044
and this is very common in
Kunming is tofu noodles.

00:13:01.044 --> 00:13:03.627
I've had tofu before, I've
had rice noodles before

00:13:03.627 --> 00:13:06.508
but I can't say that I've
had tofu rice noodles so

00:13:06.508 --> 00:13:08.376
this is the first for me.

00:13:08.376 --> 00:13:10.248
Once you start mixing it,
the tofu just kind of like

00:13:10.248 --> 00:13:13.165
minces literally into your noodles.

00:13:18.587 --> 00:13:21.035
Okay that just splattered into my eye.

00:13:21.035 --> 00:13:23.717
So the noodles taste like
they've sort of like absorbed

00:13:23.717 --> 00:13:25.318
some of that broth, they're kind of like

00:13:25.318 --> 00:13:28.698
like, um, swollen full of that broth

00:13:28.698 --> 00:13:30.811
and you do taste the
fermented soy beans in there.

00:13:30.811 --> 00:13:33.099
The tofu just sort of melts in your mouth

00:13:33.099 --> 00:13:33.972
you don't even, the

00:13:33.972 --> 00:13:36.530
tofu is sort of in your subconscious,

00:13:36.530 --> 00:13:38.075
you barely even notice the tofu.

00:13:38.075 --> 00:13:39.037
Oh, hey Micah.

00:13:39.037 --> 00:13:42.211
Okay, Micah wants to, Micah
wants to come join in.

00:13:42.211 --> 00:13:43.044
Okay.

00:13:44.078 --> 00:13:46.717
Okay, Micah let's just taste the tofu.

00:13:46.717 --> 00:13:49.386
Want to just taste a
bite of only that tofu

00:13:49.386 --> 00:13:50.460
to see how it is.

00:13:50.460 --> 00:13:54.627
But you've got to like really
pick out a little piece.

00:13:57.334 --> 00:13:58.917
It's just like, oh,

00:14:01.057 --> 00:14:03.390
it's so silky smooth

00:14:03.390 --> 00:14:05.149
you don't need to chew it at all.

00:14:05.149 --> 00:14:07.272
It just, it just disintegrates.

00:14:07.272 --> 00:14:08.646
And you can see them up front

00:14:08.646 --> 00:14:09.808
when you're ordering the noodles

00:14:09.808 --> 00:14:10.923
they're also making these little dumplings

00:14:10.923 --> 00:14:12.515
and so we got two different types.

00:14:12.515 --> 00:14:14.107
This one is a full bowl and then

00:14:14.107 --> 00:14:15.961
we also got this one over here which is

00:14:15.961 --> 00:14:17.571
already almost done,

00:14:17.571 --> 00:14:19.751
but this one is in soup
with these dumplings.

00:14:19.751 --> 00:14:22.501
So maybe I'll try this one first.

00:14:25.496 --> 00:14:26.329
Mm.

00:14:28.473 --> 00:14:31.056
They're really sticky and gummy

00:14:32.078 --> 00:14:33.828
and kind of elasticy.

00:14:34.777 --> 00:14:36.694
And then inside you've got like a

00:14:36.694 --> 00:14:38.797
I think it's a little bit of sesame

00:14:38.797 --> 00:14:41.296
and it's sweet, same type of dumpling

00:14:41.296 --> 00:14:43.042
but then they're covered
in soy bean powder

00:14:43.042 --> 00:14:44.375
and brown sugar.

00:14:46.549 --> 00:14:47.549
Mm, oh yeah.

00:14:49.500 --> 00:14:53.428
The soy bean powder is a little bit dry.

00:14:53.428 --> 00:14:55.192
Kind of sticks to the roof of your mouth

00:14:55.192 --> 00:14:56.775
but then after that

00:14:57.647 --> 00:14:59.035
you've got this sticky rice ball

00:14:59.035 --> 00:15:01.211
and then that sesame flavor.

00:15:01.211 --> 00:15:02.880
As you keep eating and get further

00:15:02.880 --> 00:15:03.713
down in your bowl of noodles,

00:15:03.713 --> 00:15:06.399
you'll notice how the
tofu is actually so soft

00:15:06.399 --> 00:15:07.809
that it starts to disintegrate

00:15:07.809 --> 00:15:10.021
and it actually becomes
the sauce, the gravy.

00:15:10.021 --> 00:15:13.102
So it's like, that's like
melted tofu down there

00:15:13.102 --> 00:15:16.685
which is just like
coating the noodles now.

00:15:19.983 --> 00:15:21.946
For me it's kind of a lot of rice noodles

00:15:21.946 --> 00:15:24.196
with a little bit of stuff.

00:15:25.338 --> 00:15:27.237
But it's really kind of,
it does taste pretty good

00:15:27.237 --> 00:15:31.404
and it is a very affordable
filling bowl of noodles.

00:15:34.825 --> 00:15:37.917
(foreign language)

00:15:37.917 --> 00:15:39.863
This is the most amazing

00:15:39.863 --> 00:15:43.515
pan of brazed chicken
I think I've ever seen;

00:15:43.515 --> 00:15:45.187
there must be an entire flock

00:15:45.187 --> 00:15:47.020
of chickens that are slow bubbling

00:15:47.020 --> 00:15:48.745
brazing away in their juices.

00:15:48.745 --> 00:15:52.844
We've got a bite of chicken
right now, brazed chicken.

00:15:52.844 --> 00:15:54.844
Got some bones in there.

00:15:56.175 --> 00:15:57.008
Wow.

00:15:57.965 --> 00:15:58.938
- [Jerry] It's really full.

00:15:58.938 --> 00:16:02.153
- [Mark] I'm standing right
next to the brazed pan

00:16:02.153 --> 00:16:04.699
and he says they braze for, for two hours.

00:16:04.699 --> 00:16:06.638
Oh, that's just a swimming pool,

00:16:06.638 --> 00:16:10.528
that's a jacuzzi of brazed chicken, wow.

00:16:10.528 --> 00:16:12.567
And that chicken tastes so good.

00:16:12.567 --> 00:16:15.400
It's really an amazing flavor too.

00:16:20.713 --> 00:16:22.633
Oh, here's the chicken feet.

00:16:22.633 --> 00:16:25.550
(foreign language)

00:16:26.995 --> 00:16:29.579
okay the owners here are so friendly

00:16:29.579 --> 00:16:31.418
that we had to get a half a chicken.

00:16:31.418 --> 00:16:34.154
Ah man, okay, this is brazed so

00:16:34.154 --> 00:16:36.313
the skin is not crispy but there

00:16:36.313 --> 00:16:38.896
is so much flavor in that meat.

00:16:42.301 --> 00:16:44.515
You've just got to be

00:16:44.515 --> 00:16:46.641
careful of the little bone shards

00:16:46.641 --> 00:16:49.141
but the flavor is just insane.

00:16:50.100 --> 00:16:51.672
The soy sauce is wonderful

00:16:51.672 --> 00:16:53.134
and there's nothing better than

00:16:53.134 --> 00:16:55.130
eating a piece of brazed chicken

00:16:55.130 --> 00:16:59.297
while you're standing in
the brazed chicken sauna.

00:17:00.923 --> 00:17:03.305
Wow that was, that was absolutely stunning

00:17:03.305 --> 00:17:06.398
and the people at this
market are so friendly.

00:17:06.398 --> 00:17:08.820
I don't know if we can
ever escape this market;

00:17:08.820 --> 00:17:11.153
there's so many good things.

00:17:15.673 --> 00:17:17.828
A little bit of a quieter
section of the market now

00:17:17.828 --> 00:17:19.758
and we're just walking
through, actually we're

00:17:19.758 --> 00:17:21.148
on our way out of the
market but Jerry said

00:17:21.148 --> 00:17:23.644
this is something, this
is a Yunnan specialty

00:17:23.644 --> 00:17:25.232
that we can't afford to miss

00:17:25.232 --> 00:17:28.065
and it's yellow soy bean porridge.

00:17:37.935 --> 00:17:41.519
Jerry's going to season it
up for us, the local style.

00:17:41.519 --> 00:17:42.689
- This is garlic.

00:17:42.689 --> 00:17:45.771
One is ginger, one is garlic.

00:17:45.771 --> 00:17:47.412
Yeah this is ginger.

00:17:47.412 --> 00:17:48.912
Put on pepper oil.

00:17:51.872 --> 00:17:52.705
Coriander.

00:17:56.912 --> 00:17:58.829
And the most important.

00:18:00.353 --> 00:18:01.392
- And so to begin eating you just

00:18:01.392 --> 00:18:03.395
kind of stir up everything,
oh yeah it's very,

00:18:03.395 --> 00:18:06.728
it's very thick, like a very thick gravy

00:18:08.651 --> 00:18:11.345
and then you stir that,
the yotiyo into there.

00:18:11.345 --> 00:18:13.082
Beautiful, and that's like their,

00:18:13.082 --> 00:18:15.124
it's kind of like actually you see people

00:18:15.124 --> 00:18:17.585
you don't eat this with a spoon.

00:18:17.585 --> 00:18:20.498
You just eat with the yotiyo, right?

00:18:20.498 --> 00:18:22.720
You just dip in yotiyo, soak it up

00:18:22.720 --> 00:18:24.134
and then you keep on eating it

00:18:24.134 --> 00:18:25.755
and then you can kind
of drink it like a gravy

00:18:25.755 --> 00:18:26.755
if you like.

00:18:29.968 --> 00:18:30.801
Mm,

00:18:32.132 --> 00:18:33.799
oh that's delicious.

00:18:34.684 --> 00:18:36.843
To give it like my very first,

00:18:36.843 --> 00:18:38.427
thought comparison

00:18:38.427 --> 00:18:41.152
it sort of tastes like biscuits and gravy.

00:18:41.152 --> 00:18:43.564
It's a savory donut, it's fried also

00:18:43.564 --> 00:18:45.986
so it's kind of crispy but then it's

00:18:45.986 --> 00:18:47.586
kind of like fluffy on the inside.

00:18:47.586 --> 00:18:49.513
I'm like surprised at how good that one is

00:18:49.513 --> 00:18:51.034
because it seams very simple,

00:18:51.034 --> 00:18:53.784
but it goes together really well.

00:18:57.548 --> 00:18:59.079
Yeah, on a cold day

00:18:59.079 --> 00:19:02.412
this would be something you want to eat.

00:19:06.256 --> 00:19:07.424
Once you're down to
the bottom of your bowl

00:19:07.424 --> 00:19:09.224
you got to just pick it
up and use your chopsticks

00:19:09.224 --> 00:19:12.724
to just sort of shovel it into your mouth.

00:19:14.703 --> 00:19:15.536
I really like it.

00:19:15.536 --> 00:19:16.705
Three and a half hours later,

00:19:16.705 --> 00:19:18.815
we are stumbling out of the market.

00:19:18.815 --> 00:19:21.662
Oh, this is such an amazing market.

00:19:21.662 --> 00:19:24.542
So much to see, it's so huge,

00:19:24.542 --> 00:19:27.351
there's an abundance of, of, things

00:19:27.351 --> 00:19:29.444
ingredients from fresh veggies

00:19:29.444 --> 00:19:32.111
to meat, to fish and then all of

00:19:33.410 --> 00:19:36.331
the cooked food is just,
it's blow your mind,

00:19:36.331 --> 00:19:38.498
there's so much available.

00:19:39.748 --> 00:19:41.090
We're taking a little walk now

00:19:41.090 --> 00:19:43.298
and it feels great to walk
after all of that food.

00:19:43.298 --> 00:19:46.370
But we're on our way to go eat.

00:19:46.370 --> 00:19:49.037
(electro music)

00:20:01.494 --> 00:20:04.411
(foreign language)

00:20:07.153 --> 00:20:08.833
- [Mark] Yeah, that one looks great.

00:20:08.833 --> 00:20:11.750
(foreign language)

00:20:13.461 --> 00:20:15.524
We got a table, we got some clay pots.

00:20:15.524 --> 00:20:17.139
We got two different clay pots,

00:20:17.139 --> 00:20:20.457
one is brazed fish, which looks delicious

00:20:20.457 --> 00:20:23.342
with chilies and yeah,
that looks fantastic

00:20:23.342 --> 00:20:24.925
and then we also got a brazed

00:20:24.925 --> 00:20:27.056
or a clay pot rice, which is rice,

00:20:27.056 --> 00:20:28.970
I think that's carrots on top with a

00:20:28.970 --> 00:20:30.372
little bit of minced meat.

00:20:30.372 --> 00:20:32.127
Jerry said that it's also okay

00:20:32.127 --> 00:20:34.225
that we eat the rest of the duck

00:20:34.225 --> 00:20:36.679
and chicken that we
picked up from the market,

00:20:36.679 --> 00:20:38.436
eat it right here, so that's, that's

00:20:38.436 --> 00:20:40.390
going to be fantastic with that rice.

00:20:40.390 --> 00:20:42.264
Oh, and on the bottom
there's tofu as well.

00:20:42.264 --> 00:20:44.596
It looks like, oh yes, oh

00:20:44.596 --> 00:20:47.113
that looks delicious, okay one

00:20:47.113 --> 00:20:49.613
of these pieces of fish first.

00:20:54.172 --> 00:20:56.992
Oh, that's like brazed in chili oil.

00:20:56.992 --> 00:21:01.347
Mm, it's kind of salty,
you can taste the aroma,

00:21:01.347 --> 00:21:03.183
like the fumes of the chili,

00:21:03.183 --> 00:21:04.703
it's not that spicy and definitely feels

00:21:04.703 --> 00:21:06.197
like the fish has been deep fried

00:21:06.197 --> 00:21:08.415
before it gets brazed in that clay pot.

00:21:08.415 --> 00:21:12.165
So it has that like
crispy, crispy sogginess.

00:21:18.074 --> 00:21:19.657
Yeah, that's tasty.

00:21:25.334 --> 00:21:28.167
It has a really nice smokey taste.

00:21:29.075 --> 00:21:32.408
And yeah, tofu just absorbs that flavor.

00:21:36.173 --> 00:21:38.327
Oh, I think those are carrots,

00:21:38.327 --> 00:21:40.196
and then that little meat almost

00:21:40.196 --> 00:21:43.279
tastes like hun beef on top of there.

00:21:47.873 --> 00:21:49.554
That duck is really something else

00:21:49.554 --> 00:21:52.336
and even if it's a little
bit cold right now,

00:21:52.336 --> 00:21:54.043
it's still delicious,

00:21:54.043 --> 00:21:57.293
but you can eat that with the hot rice.

00:22:00.525 --> 00:22:02.771
It's definitely a fresh water fish.

00:22:02.771 --> 00:22:05.515
I'm not sure exactly, it
tastes kind of like a carp.

00:22:05.515 --> 00:22:06.926
Could be carp.

00:22:06.926 --> 00:22:09.089
But, yeah, it's good.

00:22:09.089 --> 00:22:10.494
It's kind of oily,

00:22:10.494 --> 00:22:12.327
but that chili oil, mm

00:22:13.318 --> 00:22:17.401
which is, literally is
just absorbed in the fish.

00:22:20.748 --> 00:22:22.581
The tofu is delicious.

00:22:35.347 --> 00:22:36.180
- Hello.

00:22:36.180 --> 00:22:37.013
- [Mark] Nice to meet you.

00:22:37.013 --> 00:22:37.846
- Hello, hello.

00:22:37.846 --> 00:22:38.935
- Hello, hello.

00:22:38.935 --> 00:22:41.031
So Kunming barbecue is
especially popular at night

00:22:41.031 --> 00:22:43.086
and Jerry was telling me
though that this place

00:22:43.086 --> 00:22:46.289
usually it's really packed
if you come a little later

00:22:46.289 --> 00:22:49.420
at night but right now, they're

00:22:49.420 --> 00:22:50.765
they're still kind of quiet,

00:22:50.765 --> 00:22:52.587
but come a little, come a little bit later

00:22:52.587 --> 00:22:54.136
and it will be packed, but you can already

00:22:54.136 --> 00:22:56.829
smell the aroma of all the
smoke coming out of here.

00:22:56.829 --> 00:22:58.201
Okay, we're going to eat some

00:22:58.201 --> 00:23:00.868
barbecue, Yunnan style barbecue.

00:23:07.061 --> 00:23:09.182
I think there's both
beef and mutton skewers

00:23:09.182 --> 00:23:11.853
but I watched them as
they made the meat skewers

00:23:11.853 --> 00:23:13.718
and it's pretty interesting to watch them

00:23:13.718 --> 00:23:14.849
because they don't ever,

00:23:14.849 --> 00:23:17.057
what's different about how they grill

00:23:17.057 --> 00:23:20.377
and how other people grill,
or other grilled meat

00:23:20.377 --> 00:23:23.294
is that they never let the meat sit

00:23:24.271 --> 00:23:28.039
for a long period of time on the grill.

00:23:28.039 --> 00:23:30.002
They just keep it moving
all the time, so they like,

00:23:30.002 --> 00:23:32.616
play with those skewers,
they move them around they

00:23:32.616 --> 00:23:35.601
bunch them up and then they put them

00:23:35.601 --> 00:23:37.562
back together and then spread them out.

00:23:37.562 --> 00:23:38.458
Hello.

00:23:38.458 --> 00:23:42.518
And then they sprinkle
it with sesame seeds

00:23:42.518 --> 00:23:44.887
and they sprinkle it with some seasoning

00:23:44.887 --> 00:23:47.533
some salt and then they
sprinkle it with chili pepper.

00:23:47.533 --> 00:23:49.876
And then, yeah, they
keep on bunching them up

00:23:49.876 --> 00:23:52.049
and spreading them out over the hot coals

00:23:52.049 --> 00:23:56.216
and they never let them sit
directly on the hot coals.

00:23:59.528 --> 00:24:03.631
Oh, yeah, that's some good grilled meat.

00:24:03.631 --> 00:24:06.888
It's smokey, you can
taste the cumin on there.

00:24:06.888 --> 00:24:09.805
The sesame seeds, the chili flakes.

00:24:12.570 --> 00:24:14.864
Yeah that's tasty, oh yeah.

00:24:14.864 --> 00:24:16.166
You can put these here,

00:24:16.166 --> 00:24:18.118
stick it here.

00:24:18.118 --> 00:24:19.680
What do we have here?

00:24:19.680 --> 00:24:20.943
- [Jerry] Fresh water snails.

00:24:20.943 --> 00:24:21.778
- Oh nice.

00:24:21.778 --> 00:24:24.002
A special skewer, this
one is buffalo intestines

00:24:24.002 --> 00:24:25.634
and what you do is you
take it you can roll it in

00:24:25.634 --> 00:24:29.801
that dried chili, um, let's
taste the buffalo intestines.

00:24:32.632 --> 00:24:33.799
Mm, whoa, wow.

00:24:38.277 --> 00:24:40.320
Okay that was totally unexpected.

00:24:40.320 --> 00:24:42.733
I thought it was going
to be rubbery and chewy,

00:24:42.733 --> 00:24:45.561
instead it's like, crispy and it

00:24:45.561 --> 00:24:48.721
kind of explodes in your mouth

00:24:48.721 --> 00:24:51.221
with like oil that has a gamey

00:24:53.364 --> 00:24:56.992
taste to it, it's pretty awesomely good.

00:24:56.992 --> 00:24:58.575
Some type of snail.

00:25:06.357 --> 00:25:09.145
Mm, a little bit chewy and bit leathery

00:25:09.145 --> 00:25:11.406
but really good smokey flavor,

00:25:11.406 --> 00:25:14.656
again you can taste the cumin on there.

00:25:17.415 --> 00:25:19.261
Next up this is for the mushrooms and

00:25:19.261 --> 00:25:21.380
it looks like there's
some bell peppers in there

00:25:21.380 --> 00:25:24.630
and also there's kind of a pool of oil.

00:25:29.082 --> 00:25:31.653
The garlic is really, really strong.

00:25:31.653 --> 00:25:34.696
Really fresh garlic flavor to that.

00:25:34.696 --> 00:25:37.113
That's what makes it so good.

00:25:41.205 --> 00:25:44.074
We've had some meat and now we're moving

00:25:44.074 --> 00:25:45.995
on to some vegetables, we've got some

00:25:45.995 --> 00:25:48.212
Chinese chives that are
going right on the grill

00:25:48.212 --> 00:25:50.184
and then brushing them with some oil.

00:25:50.184 --> 00:25:54.920
Next up we have little bite
sized nuggets of stinky tofu

00:25:54.920 --> 00:25:57.440
and they sort of look like chicken nuggets

00:25:57.440 --> 00:25:59.523
but they are stinky tofu.

00:26:05.961 --> 00:26:08.211
Mm, they're not too stinky.

00:26:09.532 --> 00:26:11.248
This is pretty good stinky tofu,

00:26:11.248 --> 00:26:13.165
yeah, has just a slight

00:26:15.681 --> 00:26:16.514
moldy

00:26:18.343 --> 00:26:20.735
rotting flavor but not

00:26:20.735 --> 00:26:22.077
very very

00:26:22.077 --> 00:26:23.368
very very slight.

00:26:23.368 --> 00:26:24.579
The more you keep chewing

00:26:24.579 --> 00:26:26.119
the more you can't taste that stinkiness

00:26:26.119 --> 00:26:27.673
but it's not bad at all.

00:26:27.673 --> 00:26:29.054
Again the chives are done,

00:26:29.054 --> 00:26:31.971
going to have some of these chives.

00:26:36.165 --> 00:26:36.998
Fantastic.

00:26:39.256 --> 00:26:42.173
(foreign language)

00:26:45.370 --> 00:26:46.828
There's one more dish that we've got to

00:26:46.828 --> 00:26:50.160
try before the end of this
Chinese food tour of Kunming

00:26:50.160 --> 00:26:52.155
and that is called drunken shrimp

00:26:52.155 --> 00:26:54.096
and so we came to a place that serves it

00:26:54.096 --> 00:26:57.513
just down from where we were just eating.

00:27:07.069 --> 00:27:09.585
I think they're the
same type of shrimp that

00:27:09.585 --> 00:27:11.675
are eaten across Southeast Asia raw.

00:27:11.675 --> 00:27:13.734
There's a Thai dish called dancing shrimp

00:27:13.734 --> 00:27:16.484
which I think is similar to this.

00:27:25.019 --> 00:27:26.538
And you can see it's just, so

00:27:26.538 --> 00:27:29.283
it's basically just raw marinaded shrimp

00:27:29.283 --> 00:27:31.366
and just like pure chili.

00:27:35.903 --> 00:27:37.913
You do have to be a little
bit careful chewing because

00:27:37.913 --> 00:27:40.116
those shrimp are still kind of sharp.

00:27:40.116 --> 00:27:42.042
Their heads are really sharp so,

00:27:42.042 --> 00:27:44.599
you got to bite through all the shell.

00:27:44.599 --> 00:27:48.072
But that sauce is insane, it's so

00:27:48.072 --> 00:27:51.572
it's so, it's like pure chilies and garlic

00:27:53.179 --> 00:27:55.629
and the sauce is delicious.

00:27:55.629 --> 00:27:58.629
It's like herbal, it's very garlicy.

00:28:01.580 --> 00:28:03.662
Oh, it's really tasty.

00:28:03.662 --> 00:28:04.495
- [Jerry] Yeah?

00:28:04.495 --> 00:28:05.417
- Yeah,

00:28:05.417 --> 00:28:07.132
that sauce, it's all about that sauce.

00:28:07.132 --> 00:28:08.732
- [Jerry] I have a little bit

00:28:08.732 --> 00:28:11.982
of the cucumber salad first to warm up.

00:28:12.838 --> 00:28:14.373
Oh, it is good.

00:28:14.373 --> 00:28:16.289
- [Mark] The sauce is good.

00:28:16.289 --> 00:28:19.372
It's a good idea, don't eat the head.

00:28:22.478 --> 00:28:23.766
- Wow, the sauce is good.

00:28:23.766 --> 00:28:25.703
- Yeah, the sauce is really good.

00:28:25.703 --> 00:28:27.575
You could basically take that sauce

00:28:27.575 --> 00:28:29.533
and use it with anything and that

00:28:29.533 --> 00:28:30.950
thing would be delicious, that

00:28:30.950 --> 00:28:32.247
sauce is incredible and on that

00:28:32.247 --> 00:28:35.252
shrimpy, very spicy note I'm going to

00:28:35.252 --> 00:28:37.824
go ahead and end this
Chinese street food tour

00:28:37.824 --> 00:28:38.981
of Kunming today,

00:28:38.981 --> 00:28:40.513
it's been an amazing day.

00:28:40.513 --> 00:28:41.757
Kunming is really a,

00:28:41.757 --> 00:28:44.414
it's a melting pot of Yunnan and so,

00:28:44.414 --> 00:28:46.646
or even of China, people come from

00:28:46.646 --> 00:28:48.561
all over China to Kunming to settle down

00:28:48.561 --> 00:28:52.146
because the weather is known to be good

00:28:52.146 --> 00:28:54.802
throughout the entire year and

00:28:54.802 --> 00:28:58.280
so it really has a mix of cultures

00:28:58.280 --> 00:29:00.473
and foods that represent Kunming.

00:29:00.473 --> 00:29:02.743
I have fully enjoyed this
entire street food tour.

00:29:02.743 --> 00:29:04.908
I want to say a big thank you to Jerry

00:29:04.908 --> 00:29:06.583
for bringing us around and

00:29:06.583 --> 00:29:09.998
also to my friend Frank from Zouba Tours

00:29:09.998 --> 00:29:13.248
he set up everything,
he arranged everything

00:29:13.248 --> 00:29:15.674
and so a big thank you to Frank.

00:29:15.674 --> 00:29:17.834
Oh, what a day of food.

00:29:17.834 --> 00:29:19.396
