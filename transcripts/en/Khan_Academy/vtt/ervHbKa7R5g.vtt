00:00:01.210 --> 00:00:04.550
We've got a few more details
today from Geithner and the

00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:06.310
Obama administration
about their plan

00:00:06.310 --> 00:00:08.380
for saving the banks.

00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:10.900
So I figured that this is a
good time to analyze what

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:12.860
they're proposing, and see
if we can come to any

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:13.800
conclusions.

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:16.960
So, just to simplify the
original problem,

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:17.880
you have some bank.

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:20.900
Maybe it's Citibank
or somebody else.

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:23.510
Let's say they have one big bad
asset that they originally

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:26.020
paid $100 for.

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:28.970
So that was the original book
value for the asset.

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:30.140
And they were able to do that.

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:32.130
And obviously these banks have
a bunch of assets, so I'm

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:33.110
oversimplifying it.

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:36.020
But I think it'll get you
the crux of the issue.

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:41.610
They did that by-- obviously a
lot of them leveraged much

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:47.530
more-- but let's say they
used $40 of equity.

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:48.950
And then they borrowed
the remaining

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:56.370
$60 to get that asset.

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:59.100
And now of course, this
asset right here is

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.640
backed by toxic mortgages.

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:03.890
And it's the equity tranche
on these mortgages.

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:07.710
And I encourage you to watch the
videos on collateralized

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:09.990
debt obligations, and mortgage
backed securities.

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:14.210
And even the whole thing, all
of the videos that we did on

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:15.770
Paulson's original
bailout plan.

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:18.020
Because I talk about all the
liquidity issues there.

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:20.820
The bottom line is that some of
these debts are coming due

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:21.760
for these banks.

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:24.390
So they need to offload these
assets to get cash.

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:29.040
And the whole problem here is,
if they offload these assets--

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.900
let's say they know it's not
worth $100, dollars, right?

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:34.200
Everyone knows it's really
not worth $100.

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.710
But these banks don't want to
offload these assets for

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:40.630
anything less than $60.

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:43.430
Because if they offload these
assets for anything less than

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:46.350
$60, then they have
negative equity.

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:49.880
That means that the books values
here-- let's say if

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:52.170
that was the only asset
they had, then you

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:53.130
would have this situation.

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:58.160
If they offloaded for 50 cents
on the dollar, then they're

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:00.110
offloading it for $50.

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:01.250
So you'd be with this reality.

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:05.320
You would have $50.

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:09.759
And you owe $60.

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:11.450
So there's nothing left for the
equity, and in fact you

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:13.730
would go into bankruptcy.

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:15.330
You would be an insolvent
bank.

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:17.130
So just to set the framework.

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:20.690
There's a huge incentive why the
bank doesn't want to sell

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:23.660
this asset for anything less
than 60 cents on the dollar.

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:26.910
The problem is, the most that
anyone's willing to pay for it

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:29.680
right now is not even the
60 cents on the dollar.

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:32.010
People are just willing to pay--
I've read reports and it

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:34.790
depends on what asset you're
looking at-- that people are

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:35.990
willing to pay 30 cents.

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:38.980
So let me write that down,
because it is important.

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:40.270
This is what banks want.

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:45.850
Greater than 60 cents
on the dollar.

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:55.640
And in this case, it's
$100, so $60.

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:58.440
My understanding is so far, for
the most part, without any

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:01.420
government intervention, the
investors are willing to pay

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:02.650
30 cents or less.

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:03.680
So there's this disconnect.

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:05.940
The bank's like, well I'm not
willing to sell this for

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:08.810
anything less than 60 cents,
because then I'm insolvent and

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:09.810
the gig's up.

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:11.850
And investors are saying, well
these are toxic assets.

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:13.620
Every day there's more
foreclosures.

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:16.440
It's even hard to get good
documentation on what backs up

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:17.100
these loans.

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:19.540
A lot of these were
these NINJA loans.

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:21.180
No income, no job loans.

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:23.800
Or these liar loans, or stated
income loans, where people can

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:25.460
just fill out with anything
they want.

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:26.490
And there's all this fraud.

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:29.070
So people are discounting a lot
of risk into these assets.

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:31.080
So essentially, the market
isn't functioning.

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:33.950
The buyer's willingness to pay
is much slower than the

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:35.145
seller's willingness to sell.

00:03:35.145 --> 00:03:36.220
And nothing happens.

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:39.820
And so, these toxic assets are,
you could say, clogging

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:40.470
up the system.

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:43.420
Because the banks, I won't say
that they can't sell them.

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:45.000
It's just they're not willing
to sell them.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.330
Because if they were willing
to sell them at the market

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:51.140
price-- whether or not you agree
with this market price--

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:53.110
the banks will be bankrupt.

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:56.070
So the government all along
has been trying to come up

00:03:56.070 --> 00:04:01.670
with different iterations of how
can we somehow get these

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:05.160
assets off the banks' balance
sheets without causing the

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:06.310
banks to get insolvent?

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:09.600
And the original version of TARP
1 is that the government

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:12.720
will essentially buy these
assets for, who knows, 70

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:14.630
cents on the dollar.

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:17.870
And in that reality, if you
bought those assets for 70

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:20.540
cents on the dollar,
then those assets,

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:23.350
you'd have $70 here.

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:26.810
The bank would owe $60.

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:28.800
And there would still be a
little bit left of equity.

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:30.110
There would be $10 left.

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:32.920
But the important thing is that
the bank would be able to

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:37.785
pay off its liabilities, stay
liquid, and then be around for

00:04:37.785 --> 00:04:39.730
a better day or a better
economy, where it could grow

00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:42.180
the equity base again by
investing in all of that.

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:43.930
And everyone realized
that the TARP was a

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:45.090
fraud on some level.

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:48.950
Because when you do that, if the
market price really is 30

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:51.630
cents on the dollar, and
you're paying 70 cents.

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:52.890
Let me say, if this TARP 1.

00:04:56.760 --> 00:05:02.040
And the government pays 70
cents on the dollar.

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:04.480
The government's overpaying
by 40 cents on the dollar.

00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:07.790
In this case, the government
would be writing a $40 check

00:05:07.790 --> 00:05:09.110
to the owners of this company.

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:11.920
In this case, the
stockholders.

00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:14.590
And these are the very same
people the management and the

00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:16.060
original investors in a lot
of these companies.

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:18.100
These are the very same people
who got us into this mess.

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:20.750
And why should we be rewriting
them billions of dollars of

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:22.740
checks to essentially
just bail them out.

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:23.610
Why don't you just
take them into

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:25.010
receivership and all that?

00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:26.380
And I'll do other
videos on that.

00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:29.560
So the new iteration that has
come about-- and let me scroll

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:33.710
down a little bit-- is, and
let me draw the original

00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:34.960
circumstance.

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:40.020
So you have this item
here that was

00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:42.490
originally paid for $100.

00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:48.310
They borrowed $60 to
purchase them.

00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:52.030
And then they have
$40 of equity.

00:05:52.030 --> 00:05:57.040
The new plan is, the
government's saying, you're

00:05:57.040 --> 00:05:59.660
right, taxpayer.

00:05:59.660 --> 00:06:01.910
We as a government, we're not
in a position to decide what

00:06:01.910 --> 00:06:03.180
things are worth.

00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:05.790
We're not hedge fund managers
or mutual fund managers.

00:06:05.790 --> 00:06:07.550
We're just bureaucrats.

00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:08.580
And you're right.

00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:10.930
We would probably just end
up overpaying for things.

00:06:10.930 --> 00:06:12.420
Because these guys are smart.

00:06:12.420 --> 00:06:14.810
And if they're not willing to
pay more than 30 cents, and

00:06:14.810 --> 00:06:17.310
we're paying 70, we're
overpaying, and it's just a

00:06:17.310 --> 00:06:19.280
big subsidy from the taxpayer.

00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:21.610
So the new Geithner plan is
saying, hey we're going to

00:06:21.610 --> 00:06:26.770
partner with the private
investors.

00:06:26.770 --> 00:06:29.563
And the way they're suggesting
they do that, is that let's

00:06:29.563 --> 00:06:31.200
say a private investor-- and
these are numbers that I've

00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:33.550
been reading in some of the
newspaper reports, and the

00:06:33.550 --> 00:06:36.930
numbers might change over time
because they do tend to.

00:06:36.930 --> 00:06:42.810
But private investors will
contribute, say, $7.

00:06:46.510 --> 00:06:50.400
This is from private
investors.

00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:55.660
The Treasury will contribute
another-- let me make another

00:06:55.660 --> 00:06:57.980
box-- will kind of match
that investment

00:06:57.980 --> 00:06:59.130
by the private investors.

00:06:59.130 --> 00:07:02.170
So the Treasury will contribute
another $7.

00:07:07.310 --> 00:07:10.850
And then the Fed is going
to lend the balance.

00:07:10.850 --> 00:07:12.900
So the Fed-- let's see, if you
want to get to $100, that's

00:07:12.900 --> 00:07:16.872
$14-- so the Fed has
to lend $86.

00:07:16.872 --> 00:07:18.440
Let me draw a box here.

00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:25.040
It's going to look something
like that.

00:07:28.030 --> 00:07:30.460
So that's $86.

00:07:30.460 --> 00:07:31.710
from the Fed.

00:07:34.340 --> 00:07:36.790
And of course, this entity,
when it's originally

00:07:36.790 --> 00:07:42.150
capitalized, is going to be
sitting on $100 cash.

00:07:42.150 --> 00:07:44.880
That's its assets.

00:07:44.880 --> 00:07:47.100
Well I'm saying it
has $100 of cash.

00:07:47.100 --> 00:07:49.090
It could be something less, but
let's say this is what it

00:07:49.090 --> 00:07:50.590
originally sets out to be.

00:07:50.590 --> 00:07:52.840
Fed lent $86.

00:07:52.840 --> 00:07:54.640
This is a loan.

00:07:54.640 --> 00:07:58.120
The Treasury made a direct
equity investment of $7.

00:07:58.120 --> 00:08:02.030
And private investors make a
direct investment of $7.

00:08:02.030 --> 00:08:06.630
And then this entity can then
go and buy these assets.

00:08:06.630 --> 00:08:09.140
And what the government-- at
least my reading of it is-- is

00:08:09.140 --> 00:08:12.170
that the private investors are
going to set the price.

00:08:12.170 --> 00:08:14.730
So the private investors are
going to say, you know what?

00:08:14.730 --> 00:08:18.870
I think that this thing right
here is worth, I don't know, I

00:08:18.870 --> 00:08:21.740
think it's worth 70 cents
on the dollar.

00:08:21.740 --> 00:08:23.510
And let's say that they
are the winning bid.

00:08:23.510 --> 00:08:26.490
They are the people willing to
pay the most. Because that's

00:08:26.490 --> 00:08:27.060
my reading.

00:08:27.060 --> 00:08:28.100
Is that there will
be an auction.

00:08:28.100 --> 00:08:31.010
And the private investor, in
partnership with the Treasury

00:08:31.010 --> 00:08:33.230
that's willing to pay the most,
will get the assets.

00:08:33.230 --> 00:08:39.789
So that in that case-- let's say
they decide to pay $100,

00:08:39.789 --> 00:08:40.770
just to make the math easy.

00:08:40.770 --> 00:08:44.790
So then this cash will
go to this bank.

00:08:44.790 --> 00:08:49.350
So then they'll have
$100 of cash.

00:08:49.350 --> 00:08:51.590
So then we'll have the toxic
asset sitting here.

00:08:56.530 --> 00:08:58.850
And you might say, hey
Sal, that's crazy.

00:08:58.850 --> 00:09:00.270
Why would a private
investor do that?

00:09:00.270 --> 00:09:01.260
And you're right.

00:09:01.260 --> 00:09:03.890
I mean, in a lot of
circumstances, they obviously

00:09:03.890 --> 00:09:04.315
wouldn't pay.

00:09:04.315 --> 00:09:06.410
Actually, because of that, let
me not make $100 the number.

00:09:06.410 --> 00:09:10.365
Let's say that they
pay $60 for it.

00:09:10.365 --> 00:09:13.180
Because, remember, the banks
weren't even willing to part

00:09:13.180 --> 00:09:14.750
with them for less than $60.

00:09:14.750 --> 00:09:17.100
So for this to even work,
someone's going to have to pay

00:09:17.100 --> 00:09:18.900
at least $60 for this thing.

00:09:18.900 --> 00:09:21.270
So let's say they
pay $60 for it.

00:09:21.270 --> 00:09:22.520
And then they get the asset.

00:09:22.520 --> 00:09:24.500
And they're going to
have $40 left over.

00:09:24.500 --> 00:09:27.920
So they have toxic asset, and
then they're going to have $40

00:09:27.920 --> 00:09:30.860
left over, because they only
paid $60 for the security.

00:09:30.860 --> 00:09:31.740
The way I set it up.

00:09:31.740 --> 00:09:38.940
Although, they probably designed
this thing so there

00:09:38.940 --> 00:09:39.870
isn't any cash left over.

00:09:39.870 --> 00:09:42.970
But let's just use these
numbers for the sake of

00:09:42.970 --> 00:09:44.310
convenience.

00:09:44.310 --> 00:09:46.200
So now, you might say,
well, this was good.

00:09:46.200 --> 00:09:50.540
The private investors, they made
an educated decision, and

00:09:50.540 --> 00:09:52.540
they've decided to price
these things at 60

00:09:52.540 --> 00:09:53.130
cents on the dollar.

00:09:53.130 --> 00:09:57.510
And my question to you is, why
would these same people who,

00:09:57.510 --> 00:10:00.370
before this plan, weren't
willing to pay any more than

00:10:00.370 --> 00:10:04.370
30 cents on the dollar, now
be willing to pay 60

00:10:04.370 --> 00:10:05.320
cents on the dollar?

00:10:05.320 --> 00:10:08.490
Now they're willing to pay
this much for the asset.

00:10:08.490 --> 00:10:10.310
And there's a couple
of answers here.

00:10:10.310 --> 00:10:13.980
I mean, the kind of naive answer
is that the government

00:10:13.980 --> 00:10:15.060
takes the first hit.

00:10:15.060 --> 00:10:18.710
Or if these things end
up being worth 30

00:10:18.710 --> 00:10:19.480
cents on the dollar.

00:10:19.480 --> 00:10:21.840
Let's say that we go to some
future state, and these really

00:10:21.840 --> 00:10:25.080
are worth only 30 cents, the
most that the private investor

00:10:25.080 --> 00:10:28.270
loses in this situation
is his $7.

00:10:28.270 --> 00:10:30.910
The rest of the loss is
going to be borne by

00:10:30.910 --> 00:10:32.200
the Fed and the Treasury.

00:10:32.200 --> 00:10:34.090
This loan by the Federal
Reserve is a

00:10:34.090 --> 00:10:35.710
non-recourse loan.

00:10:35.710 --> 00:10:39.060
Which means that, if for
whatever reason this entity

00:10:39.060 --> 00:10:43.030
can't pay back the loan, the
lender-- which is in this case

00:10:43.030 --> 00:10:45.190
the Fed --can't go after
the equity holders.

00:10:45.190 --> 00:10:47.480
All the lender can do
is take the asset.

00:10:47.480 --> 00:10:50.460
So if this asset is worth
nothing, the Fed, all it can

00:10:50.460 --> 00:10:52.590
do is just take the asset, and
essentially it's going to get

00:10:52.590 --> 00:10:54.090
nothing back for its loan.

00:10:54.090 --> 00:10:56.420
So in this situation, the
private investor would get all

00:10:56.420 --> 00:10:58.070
of the upside.

00:10:58.070 --> 00:11:01.870
If this thing that they paid $60
for ends up being worth,

00:11:01.870 --> 00:11:05.410
let's say it ends up being
worth-- I'll draw it down here

00:11:05.410 --> 00:11:07.850
because it's all going to the
equity holder-- if that asset

00:11:07.850 --> 00:11:11.470
they paid $60 for, it if it ends
up being worth $80 then

00:11:11.470 --> 00:11:16.200
that extra $20 of value is
going to be split by the

00:11:16.200 --> 00:11:18.940
Treasury and the private
investor.

00:11:18.940 --> 00:11:20.300
So let me give you
that situation.

00:11:20.300 --> 00:11:22.020
So what would the balance
sheet look like?

00:11:22.020 --> 00:11:23.150
They pay $60 now.

00:11:23.150 --> 00:11:28.510
All of a sudden that
asset is worth $80.

00:11:28.510 --> 00:11:30.345
So this is a good scenario,
an upside scenario.

00:11:30.345 --> 00:11:32.720
Remember, we had $40 left over
in cash, just based on the way

00:11:32.720 --> 00:11:34.730
I had originally set it up.

00:11:34.730 --> 00:11:44.160
You owe $86 to the Fed, the
Federal Reserve, which is

00:11:44.160 --> 00:11:46.820
officially separate from the
Treasury, separate entity.

00:11:46.820 --> 00:11:50.560
And then the equity is split
between the Treasury and the

00:11:50.560 --> 00:11:52.230
private investor.

00:11:52.230 --> 00:11:53.920
So how much equity is there?

00:11:53.920 --> 00:11:57.920
You have $120 here minus
$86 So you have

00:11:57.920 --> 00:12:01.560
$34 of equity, right?

00:12:01.560 --> 00:12:05.740
Because you have $6 more here,
so this is $34 of equity.

00:12:05.740 --> 00:12:09.310
And it's going to be split
50-50, so it's going to be $17

00:12:09.310 --> 00:12:12.010
for the private investor.

00:12:12.010 --> 00:12:14.450
And then you have $17
for the Treasury.

00:12:14.450 --> 00:12:15.280
And this looks great.

00:12:15.280 --> 00:12:17.860
In this situation, the private
investor's original

00:12:17.860 --> 00:12:19.380
investment was $7.

00:12:19.380 --> 00:12:22.630
And it went to $17.

00:12:22.630 --> 00:12:24.900
So it's got a huge return
on investment.

00:12:24.900 --> 00:12:26.490
So this is the positive
scenario.

00:12:26.490 --> 00:12:30.780
And then the negative scenario,
where let's say that

00:12:30.780 --> 00:12:37.050
original investment actually
ends up being worth $30.

00:12:37.050 --> 00:12:42.720
Remember they had $40 of cash
in the way I set it up.

00:12:42.720 --> 00:12:44.600
Now all of a sudden the Federal
Reserve, you had a

00:12:44.600 --> 00:12:48.270
loan from the Fed for $86.

00:12:48.270 --> 00:12:50.740
Now your assets are worth less
than your liabilities.

00:12:50.740 --> 00:12:53.330
Your equity is wiped
out, right?

00:12:53.330 --> 00:12:59.150
So in this bad situation, the
private investor invested $7,

00:12:59.150 --> 00:13:01.930
and it went to zero.

00:13:01.930 --> 00:13:04.070
So this doesn't actually look
like that bad of a scenario.

00:13:04.070 --> 00:13:10.600
That in an up case, you go from
$7 to $17, And in a bad

00:13:10.600 --> 00:13:13.920
case, you go from $7
to zero dollars.

00:13:13.920 --> 00:13:15.690
And actually, this could be
magnified a lot more,

00:13:15.690 --> 00:13:17.460
depending on how these
things work out.

00:13:17.460 --> 00:13:20.310
But this still begs the
question, if an investor

00:13:20.310 --> 00:13:26.690
really thinks that these things
are worth 30 cents, and

00:13:26.690 --> 00:13:29.470
that there's no chance that
they're worth more than 60

00:13:29.470 --> 00:13:33.260
cents, even though they
disproportionately can

00:13:33.260 --> 00:13:35.210
participate in the upside,
relative to the downside,

00:13:35.210 --> 00:13:37.250
which I think in of
itself is wrong.

00:13:37.250 --> 00:13:40.215
That the government shouldn't be
subsidizing hedge funds and

00:13:40.215 --> 00:13:41.510
other private investors.

00:13:41.510 --> 00:13:44.360
But if they really thought that
the value was closer to

00:13:44.360 --> 00:13:48.120
30 than to 60, then the question
is, why would they

00:13:48.120 --> 00:13:48.910
participate at all?

00:13:48.910 --> 00:13:51.190
I mean, if you know you're
going to lose money, you

00:13:51.190 --> 00:13:52.710
shouldn't do it to begin with.

00:13:52.710 --> 00:13:54.140
And I realize I've
run out of time.

00:13:54.140 --> 00:13:55.600
I'm going to cover that
in the next video.

00:13:55.600 --> 00:13:58.140
And to some degree,
the next video

00:13:58.140 --> 00:13:59.426
you might find troubling.

00:13:59.426 --> 00:14:00.676
See you soon.
