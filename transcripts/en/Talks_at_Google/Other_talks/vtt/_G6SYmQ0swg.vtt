00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:02.020
&gt;&gt; Female Presenter: Thanks everyone for coming.

00:00:02.020 --> 00:00:05.779
So Jeffrey Sachs is the
director of the Earth Institute and professor

00:00:05.779 --> 00:00:08.440
of
sustainable development and health policy

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:11.600
and management
at Columbia University.

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:15.309
He's also a special advisor to
UN secretary general, Ban Ki-moon-- on the

00:00:15.309 --> 00:00:17.930
Millennium Development Goals, designed to
reduce extreme

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:21.750
poverty, disease and hunger by the year 2015.

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:25.370
He's been
twice named one of the 100 most influential

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:28.539
leaders in the
world by Time Magazine and is sought worldwide

00:00:28.539 --> 00:00:31.410
for his
economic advice and his unique capacity and

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:35.290
global
experience in complex economic problem solving.

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:37.760
Today he
will be talking about his new book the price

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:39.020
of
civilization.

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:42.040
So please join me in welcoming Jeffrey
Sachs.

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:43.270
[Applause]

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:46.960
&gt;&gt;Jeffrey: Thanks Stephanie.

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:49.420
Hi everybody.

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:52.140
Pleasure to be back
here, because each book I write, I get to

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.120
come to Google
Downtown.

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.560
So it's a good incentive.

00:00:56.560 --> 00:01:01.690
That sounds funny.

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:06.030
This book is about the U.S. and we're here
at the center

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:08.719
of American success.

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:15.460
So you have a very particular view
of the U.S. from the position of Google -- one

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:18.580
of the
world's great companies, one of the most dynamic

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:25.420
companies, and the leading sector of technological
change.

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:27.299
But the rest of the U.S. economy -- you're
not

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:31.399
the rest, but a lot of the U.S. economy -- is
in a terrible mess.

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:40.929
And a terrible financial, budget, and, I
claim, moral crisis as well.

00:01:40.929 --> 00:01:46.430
So I have tried to write
this book for myself to understand what is

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:51.139
it that got
the U.S., a company capable of producing a

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:56.950
Google and
others like Google, into a situation where

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:03.471
Americans in
general feel dreadful, where 80 to 90 percent

00:02:03.471 --> 00:02:06.109
of
Americans feel that the country is way off

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:11.790
track, where
91 percent of Americans disdain Congress.

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:16.110
And I think
the approval rating is about 9 percent.

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:21.010
And where the
police had to vacate the park down the road

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:26.370
here early
this morning and we'll see whether a court

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:30.720
order defends
the First Amendment or whether we really have

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:37.020
a country
where you can't aggregate to protest anymore.

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:40.310
Because
this isn't just about a park; this is about

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:43.130
highly
visible social protest.

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:48.670
And I think it's dreadful that
the police came in to move people out.

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:52.000
Really shoddy
behavior.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.680
And I hope the courts find it
unconstitutional.

00:02:55.680 --> 00:03:04.360
So that's the puzzle that I think is
the puzzle that is really before us.

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:09.920
And, as I was
writing this book, I started with the financial

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:12.510
crisis in
2008.

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:15.640
And this is something pretty understandable.

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:19.450
But
it has antecedents and the antecedents were

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:22.810
the
deregulation of the financial markets in the

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:24.700
1990s.

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:27.320
That
has antecedents in the deregulation of the

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:30.320
financial
markets in the 1980s.

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:37.060
And I found myself going back to
try to understand the story of U.S. change

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:42.070
really from
the 1970s onward, because I think the 1970s

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:47.120
was a
transition in American economic history, political

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:51.640
history, as well as a transition in the world
economy.

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:56.310
From the end of World War II, up through the
end of the

00:03:56.310 --> 00:04:02.010
1960s, America's economic dominance of the
world was

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:04.580
completely unquestioned.

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:09.440
America's technological
dominance of the world was completely unquestioned.

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:11.890
America's geopolitical dominance of the world
was

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:16.769
questioned only subject to the Cold War arms
race, but

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:22.830
not in any deeper way within the non-Communist
world.

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:27.180
And that began to change in the 1970s.

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:31.169
And I think that
that's where one has to understand what has

00:04:31.169 --> 00:04:32.169
happened.

00:04:32.169 --> 00:04:36.210
In
my view, what you are living and what the

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:41.900
U.S. is living
is a combination of the geopolitical and technological

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:45.240
revolution that began in the 1970s.

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:48.789
It's the combination
of globalization and the digital revolution.

00:04:48.789 --> 00:04:52.389
Each one
makes possible the other.

00:04:52.389 --> 00:04:57.360
Without the computer and
digital age, there would have been no globalization

00:04:57.360 --> 00:04:59.360
the
way we have it.

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:05.699
And without globalization, the likes of
Google would not really be conceivable in

00:05:05.699 --> 00:05:08.349
its current
context.

00:05:08.349 --> 00:05:12.840
The 70s opened up the world of globalization
economically.

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:17.800
And it was a very unsettling decade for
the whole world, including for the United

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:19.090
States.

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:24.280
In
1971, the exchange rate system that had dominated

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:28.270
the world
from the end of World War II until [clears

00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:30.900
throat] 1971 came to an
end.

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:33.580
It was called the Bretton Woods Exchange Rate
System.

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:37.930
[clears throat] It ended in August
1971.

00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:41.930
It set the world's currencies floating against
each other.

00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:45.099
It was part of a decade of high inflation.

00:05:45.099 --> 00:05:52.460
In 1973, we had the first soaring oil price
increases in a

00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:54.490
century, basically.

00:05:54.490 --> 00:06:02.819
When OPEC gained control of its oil
stocks from the major oil companies and in

00:06:02.819 --> 00:06:09.499
1973, for a lot
of reasons, monetary, resource-based, and

00:06:09.499 --> 00:06:14.990
geopolitical --
the oil prices increased roughly a factor

00:06:14.990 --> 00:06:16.849
of four times.

00:06:16.849 --> 00:06:22.550
And in the same year, 1973, there was a major
El Nino

00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:27.370
which was the first time we had a soaring
rise of food

00:06:27.370 --> 00:06:28.460
prices.

00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:30.689
These are all preludes to things that are
pretty

00:06:30.689 --> 00:06:34.909
common to us now.

00:06:34.909 --> 00:06:41.009
In the latter half of the 1970s, the
U.S. felt other parts of globalization.

00:06:41.009 --> 00:06:44.220
And most
importantly the manufacturing base of the

00:06:44.220 --> 00:06:47.319
United States
started to be threatened by international

00:06:47.319 --> 00:06:49.659
competition for
the first time.

00:06:49.659 --> 00:06:53.770
Japan was the leader of that.

00:06:53.770 --> 00:06:57.909
We had a
lot of tumultuous trade negotiations at the

00:06:57.909 --> 00:07:00.979
end of the 1970s with Japan.

00:07:00.979 --> 00:07:04.229
And of
course, in 1978 the biggest change of all

00:07:04.229 --> 00:07:07.900
in the world
economy began but under the radar screen entirely

00:07:07.900 --> 00:07:10.870
for
roughly a decade and that was the opening

00:07:10.870 --> 00:07:15.490
of China which
began with Deng Xiao Ping's succession to

00:07:15.490 --> 00:07:16.639
power.

00:07:16.639 --> 00:07:20.419
That
whole process of creating a global economy

00:07:20.419 --> 00:07:30.339
[clears throat] in my opinion
has been preeminent in the huge dislocations

00:07:30.339 --> 00:07:35.469
that America
has faced over the next 30 years.

00:07:35.469 --> 00:07:40.499
But the purpose of my book
is to understand the interplay of those market

00:07:40.499 --> 00:07:43.240
forces with politics.

00:07:43.240 --> 00:07:49.050
And the politics that accompanied
globalization began in 1981.

00:07:49.050 --> 00:07:54.279
And it is the combination
in my view of a path that Ronald Reagan began

00:07:54.279 --> 00:07:57.529
and that
became entrenched in this country for 30 years

00:07:57.529 --> 00:08:01.450
with
globalization that really explains where we

00:08:01.450 --> 00:08:03.370
are today.

00:08:03.370 --> 00:08:08.259
So in 1981, president Reagan was elected.

00:08:08.259 --> 00:08:13.660
And on January
20, 1981, he made a statement which I think

00:08:13.660 --> 00:08:18.599
is one of
the most important statements of modern American

00:08:18.599 --> 00:08:20.379
political economy.

00:08:20.379 --> 00:08:25.059
One of the stupidest statements I
know, but one of the most important statements

00:08:25.059 --> 00:08:26.309
as well.

00:08:26.309 --> 00:08:30.689
And the statement was that government is not
the solution

00:08:30.689 --> 00:08:35.080
to our problems, government is the problem.

00:08:35.080 --> 00:08:38.190
What Reagan
was doing and what brought him to power was

00:08:38.190 --> 00:08:39.599
a claim.

00:08:39.599 --> 00:08:42.849
The
claim was that the tumult of the 1970s, the

00:08:42.849 --> 00:08:46.180
high
inflation, the oil price shocks, the slow

00:08:46.180 --> 00:08:50.500
growth, the high
unemployment, the competition or the job losses

00:08:50.500 --> 00:08:56.130
that all
of that somehow reflected an overbearing government.

00:08:56.130 --> 00:09:00.790
It
was not a hard sell for him in a lot of ways,

00:09:00.790 --> 00:09:03.980
because
the -- a lot of the public was fixated on

00:09:03.980 --> 00:09:09.470
the war on
poverty and the social programs of the 1960s.

00:09:09.470 --> 00:09:13.709
And the
claim, which I view was wholly erroneous,

00:09:13.709 --> 00:09:18.160
that somehow
those programs -- the institution of Medicare,

00:09:18.160 --> 00:09:22.620
the
implementation of other social policies, the

00:09:22.620 --> 00:09:26.589
war on
poverty in its various aspects -- was the

00:09:26.589 --> 00:09:31.949
element that
led to the instability of the 1970s.

00:09:31.949 --> 00:09:39.220
And so, the essence
of restoring a sound economy for Reagan was

00:09:39.220 --> 00:09:43.630
to quote 'roll
back government'.

00:09:43.630 --> 00:09:49.769
It's a hypothesis that one would
entertain in a graduate seminar or maybe a

00:09:49.769 --> 00:09:53.149
first year
economics class.

00:09:53.149 --> 00:10:02.040
I think that it is one that bears no
relation to reality on the substance of fiscal

00:10:02.040 --> 00:10:05.910
policy, on
the magnitudes involved, on the possible pathways

00:10:05.910 --> 00:10:10.779
from
this kind of -- these programs that Reagan

00:10:10.779 --> 00:10:15.870
attacked to
actual outcomes, which in my view were [clears

00:10:15.870 --> 00:10:20.280
throat] almost wholly
related to the changing structure of the world

00:10:20.280 --> 00:10:24.480
economy,
the changing nature of technology, the integration

00:10:24.480 --> 00:10:27.560
of
global production systems, the relative rise

00:10:27.560 --> 00:10:31.019
of other
countries in the world economy and so on.

00:10:31.019 --> 00:10:34.610
But Reagan
made a diagnosis and he had a political force

00:10:34.610 --> 00:10:39.579
behind him
which was mainly the rise of the sun belt

00:10:39.579 --> 00:10:42.149
and the
backlash that was continuing to the civil

00:10:42.149 --> 00:10:43.680
rights era.

00:10:43.680 --> 00:10:47.279
And it was enough to squeak by in the 1980
election.

00:10:47.279 --> 00:10:48.690
He
didn't quite squeak by.

00:10:48.690 --> 00:10:53.580
There were three candidates,
but he just got a tiny majority over 50 percent

00:10:53.580 --> 00:10:58.399
of the
popular vote and won a pretty solid vote of

00:10:58.399 --> 00:11:01.779
the electoral
votes.

00:11:01.779 --> 00:11:06.840
Reagan started a process in this country that
continues basically to this day and that has

00:11:06.840 --> 00:11:12.250
proven to be
impervious to change of administration, change

00:11:12.250 --> 00:11:14.839
of
political party, and time.

00:11:14.839 --> 00:11:25.810
What Reagan started was a
drastic cut of top tax rates for highest earning

00:11:25.810 --> 00:11:28.700
individuals
and wealth holders.

00:11:28.700 --> 00:11:33.670
The rate came down from
70 percent top personal marginal tax rate

00:11:33.670 --> 00:11:35.670
to 28 percent.

00:11:35.670 --> 00:11:38.810
Then it was briefly lifted again.

00:11:38.810 --> 00:11:43.800
It's fluctuated in the
30s since then; it's now at 35 percent.

00:11:43.800 --> 00:11:47.580
But that was Reagan's lasting
contribution.

00:11:47.580 --> 00:11:51.589
Capital gains taxation and other
categories like carried interest which is

00:11:51.589 --> 00:11:57.819
applied to
hedge funds and some other financial intermediaries

00:11:57.819 --> 00:11:59.569
is at
15 percent.

00:11:59.569 --> 00:12:02.430
Capital gains tax rates are now 15 percent.

00:12:02.430 --> 00:12:06.970
They fluctuated, but the main thing Reagan
did was make a

00:12:06.970 --> 00:12:14.160
long-term, sustained, politically sustained,
transformation of

00:12:14.160 --> 00:12:17.550
the top tax rates in the country.

00:12:17.550 --> 00:12:24.680
At the same time what
he did was slash one major part of government.

00:12:24.680 --> 00:12:28.970
And that
is government services and public investment.

00:12:28.970 --> 00:12:33.100
So we have
three kinds of government programs at the

00:12:33.100 --> 00:12:34.639
federal level.

00:12:34.639 --> 00:12:38.829
We have our war machine, which we call the
defense

00:12:38.829 --> 00:12:39.829
budget.

00:12:39.829 --> 00:12:44.350
And I call the offense budget, most of the
time.

00:12:44.350 --> 00:12:49.379
And that is about a third of the budget.

00:12:49.379 --> 00:12:54.819
We have the
entitlements programs, or the transfer programs

00:12:54.819 --> 00:12:58.970
which are
social security, Medicare, Medicaid, veterans

00:12:58.970 --> 00:13:03.690
benefits
and food stamps as the predominant ones.

00:13:03.690 --> 00:13:11.890
And that's --
I'm sorry -- Medicare and Medicaid is about

00:13:11.890 --> 00:13:13.110
5 percent of
GDP.

00:13:13.110 --> 00:13:15.740
Social Security about 5 percent of GDP.

00:13:15.740 --> 00:13:18.779
The
military about 5 percent of GDP.

00:13:18.779 --> 00:13:25.829
And then veterans and
food stamps and other two to three percentage

00:13:25.829 --> 00:13:27.660
points of
GDP.

00:13:27.660 --> 00:13:31.569
Then we have a third category of programs
which are

00:13:31.569 --> 00:13:35.160
all the public services -- the direct provision
by

00:13:35.160 --> 00:13:38.750
government of services -- whether it's things
like job

00:13:38.750 --> 00:13:44.009
training or education, Pell Grants, National
Science

00:13:44.009 --> 00:13:50.620
Foundation, NASA, transportation, highway
system and so

00:13:50.620 --> 00:13:51.670
on.

00:13:51.670 --> 00:13:56.640
Environment -- all of the interior department
programs.

00:13:56.640 --> 00:14:02.910
Energy systems and so on that the federal
government maintains.

00:14:02.910 --> 00:14:08.959
Reagan tried to cut the transfer
programs and failed.

00:14:08.959 --> 00:14:13.470
George Bush, Junior tried to cut the
transfer programs and failed.

00:14:13.470 --> 00:14:19.420
They more or less
continued on as -- mostly as programmed with

00:14:19.420 --> 00:14:23.279
some
expansion of coverage--, but mainly rising

00:14:23.279 --> 00:14:26.430
costs of health
care and rising coverage because of an aging

00:14:26.430 --> 00:14:32.160
population
since the 1960s there's been little dent of

00:14:32.160 --> 00:14:35.259
that part of
the budget.

00:14:35.259 --> 00:14:38.389
The military has tended to vary depending
on

00:14:38.389 --> 00:14:42.500
which wars we're in from somewhere between
3 and 6

00:14:42.500 --> 00:14:43.839
percent of GDP.

00:14:43.839 --> 00:14:46.490
And we're at about 5 percent of GDP right
now.

00:14:46.490 --> 00:14:52.230
Not so much different from when Reagan was
in office.

00:14:52.230 --> 00:14:55.920
The part where Reagan succeeded in his goal
of rolling

00:14:55.920 --> 00:15:00.120
back government was this civilian discretionary
-- or the

00:15:00.120 --> 00:15:03.440
non-security discretionary budget.

00:15:03.440 --> 00:15:08.970
And that was cut
roughly by half as a share of national income

00:15:08.970 --> 00:15:13.089
from the
time that Reagan came in till the end of Reagan's

00:15:13.089 --> 00:15:16.470
administration and roughly till now.

00:15:16.470 --> 00:15:22.050
And this has been,
in my view one, of the decisive and lasting

00:15:22.050 --> 00:15:28.279
elements of
American reality that probably is on par with

00:15:28.279 --> 00:15:31.009
the cuts of
the tax rates.

00:15:31.009 --> 00:15:39.620
So Reagan -- the Reagan revolution, which
has been 30 years of persistence, has had

00:15:39.620 --> 00:15:43.389
three
successful sustained elements.

00:15:43.389 --> 00:15:48.259
Successful in terms of
the objectives of the authors of this revolution.

00:15:48.259 --> 00:15:53.399
One
was a deep and persistent cut of top tax rates.

00:15:53.399 --> 00:15:58.470
The
second was a massive deregulation of the financial

00:15:58.470 --> 00:16:03.160
industry of broadcasting and media.

00:16:03.160 --> 00:16:06.290
And substantially of
the environment.

00:16:06.290 --> 00:16:08.999
So significant deregulation.

00:16:08.999 --> 00:16:13.040
And the
third were sharp cuts that have lasted in

00:16:13.040 --> 00:16:16.639
the
non-security discretionary budget of the United

00:16:16.639 --> 00:16:18.199
States.

00:16:18.199 --> 00:16:21.980
We've now done this for 30 years.

00:16:21.980 --> 00:16:25.140
The reason I wrote
this book is that I think it's a disaster,

00:16:25.140 --> 00:16:27.339
what's come out
of this.

00:16:27.339 --> 00:16:29.420
And I just want to show you a little bit of
the

00:16:29.420 --> 00:16:33.379
reality of this and then I'm going to turn
it -- open it

00:16:33.379 --> 00:16:35.629
to questions.

00:16:35.629 --> 00:16:43.139
Of course, one of the things that happened
is a remarkable widening of inequality in

00:16:43.139 --> 00:16:48.040
the United
States that began in 1981.

00:16:48.040 --> 00:16:54.850
You see that we have a
U-shaped income distribution measured as the

00:16:54.850 --> 00:16:59.079
share of the
top one percent of households in household

00:16:59.079 --> 00:17:00.079
income.

00:17:00.079 --> 00:17:04.709
It
reached a peak in 1929 when the top one percent

00:17:04.709 --> 00:17:09.510
of
households in an era of unregulated speculation

00:17:09.510 --> 00:17:16.980
and the
tax cuts and other policies of the Harding

00:17:16.980 --> 00:17:21.980
Coolidge
Hoover decade of the 1920s brought the share

00:17:21.980 --> 00:17:27.289
of the top 1
percent to about 24 percent of total household

00:17:27.289 --> 00:17:28.289
income.

00:17:28.289 --> 00:17:30.520
Then came the Great Depression.

00:17:30.520 --> 00:17:36.900
World War II, the New Deal,
very steep increases of top tax rates.

00:17:36.900 --> 00:17:39.960
And you see
that there were about three decades where

00:17:39.960 --> 00:17:45.960
that flat line
at the bottom of the U shows that the top

00:17:45.960 --> 00:17:51.730
one percent of
households had a share of the income of about

00:17:51.730 --> 00:17:56.780
10
percent, 9 to 11 percent of total household

00:17:56.780 --> 00:17:57.780
income.

00:17:57.780 --> 00:18:02.820
Reagan came in 1981 and that's exactly in
fact when this

00:18:02.820 --> 00:18:06.400
curve starts to increase.

00:18:06.400 --> 00:18:10.720
There were many parts of it --
globalization would have already driven some

00:18:10.720 --> 00:18:11.720
inequality.

00:18:11.720 --> 00:18:13.810
We know that because this curve turns up in
just about

00:18:13.810 --> 00:18:17.080
every high-income country in the world.

00:18:17.080 --> 00:18:20.400
But it's the
United States that has by far the biggest

00:18:20.400 --> 00:18:21.400
increase.

00:18:21.400 --> 00:18:23.909
Because it's really only in the United States
that

00:18:23.909 --> 00:18:28.470
government amplified the forces of globalization
to lead

00:18:28.470 --> 00:18:34.159
to this remarkable surge of incomes and, I
should say,

00:18:34.159 --> 00:18:35.900
wealth at the top.

00:18:35.900 --> 00:18:43.770
The bottom line is -- in red -- is
the share of the top 0.01 percent of households.

00:18:43.770 --> 00:18:47.430
We have
120 million households in the United States.

00:18:47.430 --> 00:18:51.950
So 0.01
percent is 12,000 households.

00:18:51.950 --> 00:18:57.100
Those 12,000 households
take in about 5 percent of total household

00:18:57.100 --> 00:18:58.890
income.

00:18:58.890 --> 00:19:02.500
And
that is more than the bottom 24 million households

00:19:02.500 --> 00:19:04.200
in the
United States.

00:19:04.200 --> 00:19:09.890
So we have quite deeply entrenched
poverty at the bottom and extraordinary wealth

00:19:09.890 --> 00:19:11.500
at the
top.

00:19:11.500 --> 00:19:13.960
What happened in the middle is quite notable.

00:19:13.960 --> 00:19:16.910
And
that's shown on the right-hand side.

00:19:16.910 --> 00:19:23.320
This is the median
earnings of full-time, year-round, male workers.

00:19:23.320 --> 00:19:30.700
They peaked in 1973,
which is a really astounding,

00:19:30.700 --> 00:19:34.020
surprising feature of the U.S. economy.

00:19:34.020 --> 00:19:38.340
It's been 38
years since there was, since we reached the

00:19:38.340 --> 00:19:42.590
peak of the
median male worker.

00:19:42.590 --> 00:19:46.250
For women workers, the picture is
different.

00:19:46.250 --> 00:19:51.700
It's continued to rise from much lower levels
than men.

00:19:51.700 --> 00:19:54.630
And also, for two reasons, which are hard
to

00:19:54.630 --> 00:19:56.940
disentangle -- at least hard for me to disentangle.

00:19:56.940 --> 00:20:00.080
One
is women faced massive discrimination which

00:20:00.080 --> 00:20:02.020
has gradually
eased.

00:20:02.020 --> 00:20:07.500
And the second is that women are in the
non-traded goods sector of the economy to

00:20:07.500 --> 00:20:09.950
a much higher
extent than men.

00:20:09.950 --> 00:20:15.260
So male median workers who are
basically high school grads faced the decline

00:20:15.260 --> 00:20:21.010
of the
tradeable sector in response to globalization.

00:20:21.010 --> 00:20:23.970
The
peak employment in manufacturing in the United

00:20:23.970 --> 00:20:28.240
States
occurred in 1979 when we reached 19 million

00:20:28.240 --> 00:20:30.190
workers in
manufacturing.

00:20:30.190 --> 00:20:33.470
And since then, it's come down to about
10 million.

00:20:33.470 --> 00:20:42.860
So men faced a sharp decline in the sectors
where men predominate whereas women are more

00:20:42.860 --> 00:20:45.750
in the
service sector which is mainly a sheltered

00:20:45.750 --> 00:20:49.390
sector up to
this point vis-a-vis international trade.

00:20:49.390 --> 00:20:53.659
And so,
somehow the combination of reducing discrimination

00:20:53.659 --> 00:20:57.100
and
less impact of globalization has meant that

00:20:57.100 --> 00:21:01.980
women's
median earnings have continued to rise a bit

00:21:01.980 --> 00:21:06.380
whereas male
earnings peaked already in 1973.

00:21:06.380 --> 00:21:11.980
I think that these two
pictures basically depict the American phenomenon

00:21:11.980 --> 00:21:13.549
pretty clearly.

00:21:13.549 --> 00:21:21.380
And that is that the combination of
globalization and Reaganomics has meant stagnation

00:21:21.380 --> 00:21:27.200
in the
middle, soaring wealth at the top, and deepening

00:21:27.200 --> 00:21:32.080
poverty at the bottom -- other than for the
elderly.

00:21:32.080 --> 00:21:34.559
And
recent statistics suggest that the poverty

00:21:34.559 --> 00:21:39.500
of the elderly
may be more than is conventionally captured

00:21:39.500 --> 00:21:43.100
by the
standard poverty rates.

00:21:43.100 --> 00:21:50.380
Now, in normal countries of
which the U.S. is not one, government actually

00:21:50.380 --> 00:21:54.910
acted to
do something about these increasing tensions.

00:21:54.910 --> 00:22:00.840
In
national economies facing a very radically

00:22:00.840 --> 00:22:04.260
changed global
economy.

00:22:04.260 --> 00:22:07.409
And the main response that one would like
to

00:22:07.409 --> 00:22:11.440
see in response to globalization is rising
skills

00:22:11.440 --> 00:22:17.940
accumulation and helping all parts of the
society to gain

00:22:17.940 --> 00:22:23.550
a foothold in remunerative work.

00:22:23.550 --> 00:22:28.529
One of the facts of
globalization has been a sharp widening of

00:22:28.529 --> 00:22:32.500
the wage,
education gradient.

00:22:32.500 --> 00:22:40.529
I think I have a picture of it.

00:22:40.529 --> 00:22:42.720
Yeah.

00:22:42.720 --> 00:22:45.520
Education -- or earnings have risen only for
those

00:22:45.520 --> 00:22:50.279
with Bachelor's degrees or above, on average,
in the United States.

00:22:50.279 --> 00:22:55.270
And so, one of the responses that one would
have wanted is an

00:22:55.270 --> 00:22:59.910
upgrading of educational attainment and skills
attainment.

00:22:59.910 --> 00:23:06.690
The conventional way would be a higher
through-put of college graduates.

00:23:06.690 --> 00:23:10.620
Probably there are new,
creative, unconventional ways with different

00:23:10.620 --> 00:23:13.940
kinds of
skills qualifications.

00:23:13.940 --> 00:23:19.540
But on essentially all counts
that we can measure, the United States has

00:23:19.540 --> 00:23:24.490
stagnated in
the educational attainments both in terms

00:23:24.490 --> 00:23:30.159
of raw numbers
like proportions completing a 4-year's Bachelor's

00:23:30.159 --> 00:23:31.760
degree.

00:23:31.760 --> 00:23:36.720
And as also stagnated in effective training
of certificate

00:23:36.720 --> 00:23:43.909
programs, more focused post-high school skill
programs.

00:23:43.909 --> 00:23:48.380
And we have the irony of very high unemployment
and a

00:23:48.380 --> 00:23:52.090
huge shortage in the U.S. economy of what
you guys do.

00:23:52.090 --> 00:23:54.090
It's very hard to hire programmers.

00:23:54.090 --> 00:23:55.690
You know that.

00:23:55.690 --> 00:23:58.110
And
it's very hard to hire them at what I would

00:23:58.110 --> 00:23:59.740
call
reasonable salaries.

00:23:59.740 --> 00:24:01.420
You know that, too.

00:24:01.420 --> 00:24:07.149
And that's one
of the facts of our economy, which is that

00:24:07.149 --> 00:24:11.270
globalization
has given a premium to skills.

00:24:11.270 --> 00:24:15.299
It's given a premium to
educational attainment.

00:24:15.299 --> 00:24:19.110
It's given a premium to various
kinds of skill attainment.

00:24:19.110 --> 00:24:24.850
But the through-put of U.S.
education system has -- it's budged, but it's

00:24:24.850 --> 00:24:27.270
barely
budged in the process.

00:24:27.270 --> 00:24:32.120
And what other governments did in
northern Europe, which are the countries I

00:24:32.120 --> 00:24:34.170
most admire.

00:24:34.170 --> 00:24:38.220
Countries like Korea which have been most
successful in

00:24:38.220 --> 00:24:43.940
rapid catching up into becoming high-income
countries.

00:24:43.940 --> 00:24:48.820
The government invested very heavily in the
whole life

00:24:48.820 --> 00:24:54.970
cycle of education, and human capital development
from

00:24:54.970 --> 00:24:57.980
preschool and early childhood development
all the way

00:24:57.980 --> 00:24:59.630
through University.

00:24:59.630 --> 00:25:02.539
The United States did the opposite,
basically.

00:25:02.539 --> 00:25:06.679
We've been cutting spending in this area.

00:25:06.679 --> 00:25:10.090
There is lots of political economy why that
is, but

00:25:10.090 --> 00:25:13.860
that's the path that Reagan set us on.

00:25:13.860 --> 00:25:19.210
So, a summary that
I think is a fair summary is that all high-income

00:25:19.210 --> 00:25:24.470
countries experienced rising inequality and
job loss in

00:25:24.470 --> 00:25:28.570
the manufacturing sector in response to globalization
and

00:25:28.570 --> 00:25:32.480
technological change from the 1980s onward.

00:25:32.480 --> 00:25:35.260
The United
States is the country that has ended up with

00:25:35.260 --> 00:25:39.470
the
biggest inequality.

00:25:39.470 --> 00:25:42.160
The biggest underclass.

00:25:42.160 --> 00:25:46.390
The most
dug-in poverty.

00:25:46.390 --> 00:25:53.309
And the least public response to this
challenge up until now.

00:25:53.309 --> 00:26:01.080
And almost nothing has changed
the direction of actual policies for 30 years.

00:26:01.080 --> 00:26:09.490
So let me
just show you the upshot of this.

00:26:09.490 --> 00:26:14.519
This is, for me, the
essence of our Washington problem.

00:26:14.519 --> 00:26:17.130
We have many other
problems in this country, but this is our

00:26:17.130 --> 00:26:18.820
Washington
problem.

00:26:18.820 --> 00:26:20.860
Our Washington problem is that we have lots
of

00:26:20.860 --> 00:26:25.909
important things to do that we need to do
collectively.

00:26:25.909 --> 00:26:28.640
Almost a -- actually not almost -- a very
dirty word in

00:26:28.640 --> 00:26:31.269
the United States -- the idea that we should
do things

00:26:31.269 --> 00:26:33.870
together as a society.

00:26:33.870 --> 00:26:39.559
But there are public goods and
public services, and they're vital for a couple

00:26:39.559 --> 00:26:40.559
of
reasons.

00:26:40.559 --> 00:26:44.460
One, markets don't provide these goods and
services adequately.

00:26:44.460 --> 00:26:49.450
And second, poor people can't avail
themselves of these goods and services without

00:26:49.450 --> 00:26:51.279
help.

00:26:51.279 --> 00:26:58.210
Education is a classic example of this, already
recognized by Adam Smith as an area of society

00:26:58.210 --> 00:27:01.380
where the
government needs to play an important role.

00:27:01.380 --> 00:27:05.350
So, these
are all the categories of our non-security

00:27:05.350 --> 00:27:07.059
discretionary
budget.

00:27:07.059 --> 00:27:13.140
The part I mentioned that Ronald Reagan
slashed -- it includes legislature and the

00:27:13.140 --> 00:27:17.191
court system,
agriculture, commerce, the education department,

00:27:17.191 --> 00:27:19.889
which I
think two thirds of the Republican candidates

00:27:19.889 --> 00:27:22.049
want to
eliminate entirely.

00:27:22.049 --> 00:27:28.700
The energy department, which would
be responsible for actually helping America

00:27:28.700 --> 00:27:32.350
to make a
transformation to a low carbon future -- something

00:27:32.350 --> 00:27:36.419
that
we have no interest in doing it seems at the

00:27:36.419 --> 00:27:37.690
moment.

00:27:37.690 --> 00:27:40.289
Public health.

00:27:40.289 --> 00:27:45.389
Affordable housing which we left to Wall
Street rather than to government policy.

00:27:45.389 --> 00:27:48.950
The Interior
Department which is, of course, our public

00:27:48.950 --> 00:27:52.690
lands
management.

00:27:52.690 --> 00:27:58.179
Justice department, labor department, which
is job training, active labor market programs.

00:27:58.179 --> 00:28:02.830
Transport
which would mean high speed rail if we happen

00:28:02.830 --> 00:28:06.049
to live in
China, but means Amtrak if you live in the

00:28:06.049 --> 00:28:10.520
United
States, which is no speed rail half the time.

00:28:10.520 --> 00:28:14.610
Environmental Protection Agency, NASA and
so on.

00:28:14.610 --> 00:28:18.230
So
here's what has happened to all of that.

00:28:18.230 --> 00:28:22.360
As I said,
Reagan came in, and if you look all the way

00:28:22.360 --> 00:28:28.769
on the left,
that sum of activities was between 5 and 6

00:28:28.769 --> 00:28:32.180
percent of
national income at the end of the 1970s.

00:28:32.180 --> 00:28:34.020
Too small.

00:28:34.020 --> 00:28:36.570
Low
compared to other countries.

00:28:36.570 --> 00:28:40.240
Because we do very little
in labor market policy.

00:28:40.240 --> 00:28:43.059
We do very little for early
childhood development.

00:28:43.059 --> 00:28:47.330
We give no family support to
speak of in this country or almost no family

00:28:47.330 --> 00:28:49.029
support.

00:28:49.029 --> 00:28:53.610
We don't do housing policy and so on other
than the crazy

00:28:53.610 --> 00:28:59.630
way that blew up through Fannie Mae/Freddie
Mac and

00:28:59.630 --> 00:29:03.059
subprime mortgages, because we don't do direct
budget

00:29:03.059 --> 00:29:05.330
outlays as other countries do.

00:29:05.330 --> 00:29:08.039
But we were doing 5 to 6
percent.

00:29:08.039 --> 00:29:11.919
Then Reagan came and you see the collapse
of

00:29:11.919 --> 00:29:15.929
the discretionary programs as a share of national
income

00:29:15.929 --> 00:29:19.160
down to about two and a half percent.

00:29:19.160 --> 00:29:22.380
It continued all
the way through every administration.

00:29:22.380 --> 00:29:25.481
There's really
very little difference between Democrats and

00:29:25.481 --> 00:29:27.899
Republicans
in this country in terms of what they really

00:29:27.899 --> 00:29:31.679
mean when
they're in office, because the more fundamental

00:29:31.679 --> 00:29:35.840
politics
is much more dug-in than the yakking on the

00:29:35.840 --> 00:29:37.549
cable news
shows.

00:29:37.549 --> 00:29:42.279
And the basics of the Reagan era -- low tax
rates

00:29:42.279 --> 00:29:46.519
at the top, low spending for public goods
and services,

00:29:46.519 --> 00:29:50.730
and deregulation has been a constant, not
a partisan

00:29:50.730 --> 00:29:53.200
variable.

00:29:53.200 --> 00:29:56.900
This continued up through 2009.

00:29:56.900 --> 00:30:01.909
You see this
little spike, which is in my view one of the

00:30:01.909 --> 00:30:04.730
more useless
things our country has tried to do.

00:30:04.730 --> 00:30:08.440
That's called the
stimulus legislation.

00:30:08.440 --> 00:30:12.730
The idea of the stimulus
legislation was, "we have a crisis; we should

00:30:12.730 --> 00:30:15.429
jolt the
economy back to normal."

00:30:15.429 --> 00:30:19.700
The mistake of that concept was
the economy wasn't normal.

00:30:19.700 --> 00:30:25.720
The economy was in structural
transformation, not in short-term business

00:30:25.720 --> 00:30:28.820
cycle crisis.

00:30:28.820 --> 00:30:32.159
And a temporary jolt is pretty useless.

00:30:32.159 --> 00:30:36.419
And that's what
came out of the stimulus -- very little.

00:30:36.419 --> 00:30:37.690
We had a blip.

00:30:37.690 --> 00:30:39.500
It came back down.

00:30:39.500 --> 00:30:44.940
And what you can see, which I find to
be the most alarming single fact of our politics

00:30:44.940 --> 00:30:48.230
today --
something that's almost unremarked upon I

00:30:48.230 --> 00:30:53.120
would add in
our political life is that what Congress and

00:30:53.120 --> 00:30:57.590
the White House
have agreed to in August is this category

00:30:57.590 --> 00:31:02.340
of the budget
should be capped at a rate of increase lower

00:31:02.340 --> 00:31:06.580
than
inflation so that the share of this spending

00:31:06.580 --> 00:31:10.450
relative to
national income will continue to decline so

00:31:10.450 --> 00:31:15.330
that all
those things that I mentioned -- the environment,

00:31:15.330 --> 00:31:21.590
science, training, education, affordable housing,
the

00:31:21.590 --> 00:31:27.880
justice system -- all of that, transport -- will
be less

00:31:27.880 --> 00:31:31.169
than 2 percent of national income.

00:31:31.169 --> 00:31:33.200
That's the trajectory
we're on.

00:31:33.200 --> 00:31:38.440
So we're basically closing down government
other than those big buildings on Constitution

00:31:38.440 --> 00:31:41.720
Avenue, if
you happen to go to Washington for some strange

00:31:41.720 --> 00:31:42.720
reason.

00:31:42.720 --> 00:31:44.640
And there is no reason to go to Washington
except if you

00:31:44.640 --> 00:31:48.690
want to lobby for tax breaks or you're a tourist
to see

00:31:48.690 --> 00:31:52.539
those big buildings and wonder what they do
inside.

00:31:52.539 --> 00:31:56.120
Because actually, they don't do anything anymore.

00:31:56.120 --> 00:31:58.309
And
that's the whole idea of this country.

00:31:58.309 --> 00:32:00.140
We want just
those big buildings.

00:32:00.140 --> 00:32:03.789
The interior department, great; labor
department, fascinating.

00:32:03.789 --> 00:32:05.789
And we even have a debate,
"should we have them?

00:32:05.789 --> 00:32:06.789
Should we not have them?

00:32:06.789 --> 00:32:10.409
They
could be turned into giant Starbucks or something."

00:32:10.409 --> 00:32:14.620
And
that's where we really are.

00:32:14.620 --> 00:32:20.899
My view is that we have a very
very deep structural crisis in this country.

00:32:20.899 --> 00:32:24.320
We have
half the population not making it.

00:32:24.320 --> 00:32:28.690
And feeling the pull
of poverty.

00:32:28.690 --> 00:32:32.899
We have people like you and Google making
it.

00:32:32.899 --> 00:32:36.169
And making it quite spectacularly.

00:32:36.169 --> 00:32:38.230
So we have a
dual economy.

00:32:38.230 --> 00:32:42.149
The luxury industry is booming right now.

00:32:42.149 --> 00:32:44.270
The money at the top is booming.

00:32:44.270 --> 00:32:46.100
Corporate profits are
booming.

00:32:46.100 --> 00:32:48.510
You have plenty of tax privileges to keep
those

00:32:48.510 --> 00:32:51.200
corporate profits as well.

00:32:51.200 --> 00:32:58.220
The share of taxation of
corporate income as a percent of national

00:32:58.220 --> 00:33:03.550
income is
basically historic low at this point.

00:33:03.550 --> 00:33:07.759
The corporate
sector is only paying 1.5 percent of GNP in

00:33:07.759 --> 00:33:11.730
corporate
taxes, because you're able to book the profits

00:33:11.730 --> 00:33:17.460
overseas,
keep them overseas at effectively almost 0

00:33:17.460 --> 00:33:18.730
taxation.

00:33:18.730 --> 00:33:23.480
And
we're told that the only thing we can do in

00:33:23.480 --> 00:33:28.929
this country
is follow this curve down to oblivion, which

00:33:28.929 --> 00:33:33.289
is the path
that I think we're on if we continue this

00:33:33.289 --> 00:33:34.309
way.

00:33:34.309 --> 00:33:37.370
And
that's the -- more or less the bipartisan

00:33:37.370 --> 00:33:39.670
consensus.

00:33:39.670 --> 00:33:44.399
So
the Republicans would like to slash further.

00:33:44.399 --> 00:33:48.909
Right now
we're collecting about 15 percent of GDP in

00:33:48.909 --> 00:33:51.179
federal
taxation.

00:33:51.179 --> 00:33:56.539
Maybe we get back to 17 percent of GDP with
the full business cycle recovery -- if such

00:33:56.539 --> 00:34:01.159
a concept is
even meaningful anymore.

00:34:01.159 --> 00:34:07.740
The Republican plans are more
or less to try to stabilize at 15 percent

00:34:07.740 --> 00:34:09.460
of GDP.

00:34:09.460 --> 00:34:11.520
You
just about what that means from a budgetary

00:34:11.520 --> 00:34:12.520
point of
view.

00:34:12.520 --> 00:34:14.839
The military right now is 5.

00:34:14.839 --> 00:34:16.649
Social Security is 5.

00:34:16.649 --> 00:34:19.079
Medicare, Medicaid is 5.

00:34:19.079 --> 00:34:22.409
That's 15 already.

00:34:22.409 --> 00:34:24.399
Interest on the debt is going to be 2 to 3.

00:34:24.399 --> 00:34:28.340
That makes
17 and a half or 18 percent.

00:34:28.340 --> 00:34:34.330
And all of this stuff which
I call "government," that's all on borrowed

00:34:34.330 --> 00:34:35.330
money.

00:34:35.330 --> 00:34:37.599
And
they just want to close down as much of that

00:34:37.599 --> 00:34:40.359
as possible.

00:34:40.359 --> 00:34:48.770
The Democrats basically disagree with that
-- kind of.

00:34:48.770 --> 00:34:53.250
But mainly Democrats are the party of hand
wringers.

00:34:53.250 --> 00:34:56.700
We
know we need to cut; it's terrible.

00:34:56.700 --> 00:34:59.890
And to wring their
hands and to agree on the cuts.

00:34:59.890 --> 00:35:02.430
And the Republicans are
the happy party.

00:35:02.430 --> 00:35:03.670
We're going to cut.

00:35:03.670 --> 00:35:06.470
We're going to cut
six departments, I can't remember what they

00:35:06.470 --> 00:35:07.470
are.

00:35:07.470 --> 00:35:11.260
[laughter] I know
it is -- whatever it is -- I don't care what

00:35:11.260 --> 00:35:12.260
it is.

00:35:12.260 --> 00:35:15.370
It
could be interior -- EPA -- fine.

00:35:15.370 --> 00:35:16.910
Doesn't matter.

00:35:16.910 --> 00:35:23.040
They
can't wait to solidify this income distribution.

00:35:23.040 --> 00:35:25.720
That's
the whole goal right now on the Republican

00:35:25.720 --> 00:35:26.720
side.

00:35:26.720 --> 00:35:29.650
Make
this income inequality permanent.

00:35:29.650 --> 00:35:33.130
Put it off bounds of
politics.

00:35:33.130 --> 00:35:39.880
Institute a philosophy in this country of
Ayn Rand that not only do you have no right

00:35:39.880 --> 00:35:43.070
to ask
anybody anything.

00:35:43.070 --> 00:35:48.500
If a rich person gives something,
they're just demeaning and debasing themselves.

00:35:48.500 --> 00:35:51.170
That's
Ayn Rand's philosophy.

00:35:51.170 --> 00:35:56.130
Not only is there no right, not
only is there no responsibility, anything

00:35:56.130 --> 00:36:01.960
that reeks of a
contribution of rich and powerful to the rest

00:36:01.960 --> 00:36:05.319
of society
is a debasement of human values.

00:36:05.319 --> 00:36:10.410
It's the worst
perversion of philosophy that I know that

00:36:10.410 --> 00:36:17.460
is taken
seriously by a segment of the American population.

00:36:17.460 --> 00:36:23.040
And
the Democrats don't have the fire power and

00:36:23.040 --> 00:36:25.930
the stamina
to resist any of it.

00:36:25.930 --> 00:36:30.650
Fundamentally, both political
parties are taking campaign contributions

00:36:30.650 --> 00:36:34.329
from the top
one percent.

00:36:34.329 --> 00:36:41.190
They're taking campaign contributions from
the major corporations now after Citizens

00:36:41.190 --> 00:36:43.380
United.

00:36:43.380 --> 00:36:45.410
Obama
doesn't have the guts to fight this.

00:36:45.410 --> 00:36:49.140
I don't think he
wants to fight it necessarily, but he doesn't

00:36:49.140 --> 00:36:53.410
have really
the guts or the stamina to fight it.

00:36:53.410 --> 00:36:56.050
And the
Republicans -- are not only not fighting it,

00:36:56.050 --> 00:37:01.210
this is the
whole purpose of the modern Republican party.

00:37:01.210 --> 00:37:05.430
And so, I
think it's likely that we're going to continue

00:37:05.430 --> 00:37:09.020
on this
kind of trajectory with a meaner and more

00:37:09.020 --> 00:37:14.670
divided society
unless there's a break in the politics.

00:37:14.670 --> 00:37:18.380
And, from a
programmatic level, I don't think it's too

00:37:18.380 --> 00:37:21.010
complicated
what to do.

00:37:21.010 --> 00:37:27.720
And my view is that we need to tax several
percent of GDP more in order to be able to

00:37:27.720 --> 00:37:32.940
expand
spending on education, on early childhood

00:37:32.940 --> 00:37:37.780
development, on
science and technology, on low carbon energy

00:37:37.780 --> 00:37:38.780
systems.

00:37:38.780 --> 00:37:41.460
On
other environmental protection.

00:37:41.460 --> 00:37:46.140
We simply don't have the
means right now in government to be able to

00:37:46.140 --> 00:37:50.700
fund basic
public goods and services and public investments

00:37:50.700 --> 00:37:55.520
to
modernize the economy and to make sure that

00:37:55.520 --> 00:37:57.770
we have an
inclusive society.

00:37:57.770 --> 00:38:04.500
So I think we need probably about 4
percentage points of GDP more on the tax side

00:38:04.500 --> 00:38:06.140
as a
minimum.

00:38:06.140 --> 00:38:11.780
And I recommend a steep increase of top
marginal tax rates.

00:38:11.780 --> 00:38:17.119
I recommend a wealth tax on very
high net worth -- above 5 million dollars

00:38:17.119 --> 00:38:19.500
-- a 1 percent
net worth tax.

00:38:19.500 --> 00:38:27.030
I recommend a -- basically removing the
deferral privileges of companies on their

00:38:27.030 --> 00:38:30.140
offshore
profits.

00:38:30.140 --> 00:38:37.240
Because this deferral is really an invitation
to serial amnesties, quote unquote, like the

00:38:37.240 --> 00:38:40.420
one we're
working up to now that companies park their

00:38:40.420 --> 00:38:42.930
profits
abroad, they wait a few years, they're able

00:38:42.930 --> 00:38:47.369
to bring them
back, and we're essentially in a system where

00:38:47.369 --> 00:38:50.329
we've
gutted the corporate tax rate.

00:38:50.329 --> 00:38:54.630
And so, I think we should
claim at least a percentage point more in

00:38:54.630 --> 00:38:57.790
corporate
taxation, at least a percentage point more

00:38:57.790 --> 00:38:59.930
in income
taxation.

00:38:59.930 --> 00:39:04.200
A percentage more in GDP in net worth
taxation.

00:39:04.200 --> 00:39:08.380
And then, there are a handful of other taxes.

00:39:08.380 --> 00:39:13.140
And simply enforcement of the tax laws, which
by itself

00:39:13.140 --> 00:39:17.710
is estimated -- would yield at least another
percentage

00:39:17.710 --> 00:39:19.200
point of GDP.

00:39:19.200 --> 00:39:21.440
But I favor a carbon tax.

00:39:21.440 --> 00:39:25.170
I favor a
financial transactions tax.

00:39:25.170 --> 00:39:29.530
And I favor stiffer
enforcement of our tax code.

00:39:29.530 --> 00:39:35.010
And the sum in my view
could realistically increase revenues by four

00:39:35.010 --> 00:39:38.650
or five
percentage points of GDP and give us a chance

00:39:38.650 --> 00:39:45.990
to avoid this decline
to what I think would be a society of locked-in

00:39:45.990 --> 00:39:49.770
poverty,
inequality, and increasing unrest.

00:39:49.770 --> 00:39:53.740
Now, neither
political party comes close to supporting

00:39:53.740 --> 00:39:54.740
this.

00:39:54.740 --> 00:39:58.500
Paul
Ryan officially declared my book un-American

00:39:58.500 --> 00:40:01.740
and contrary
to the principles of the founding fathers.

00:40:01.740 --> 00:40:06.700
I officially
declared him a hack politician who is on the

00:40:06.700 --> 00:40:12.580
take of
David Koch and has a few scruples of any sort

00:40:12.580 --> 00:40:14.340
that I've
been able to notice.

00:40:14.340 --> 00:40:19.132
But, when you do the basic
arithmetic, either we eliminate the government

00:40:19.132 --> 00:40:24.040
[clears throat] and we
slash programs for the poor -- which is the

00:40:24.040 --> 00:40:25.690
Republican
platform.

00:40:25.690 --> 00:40:32.380
Or we just gradually asphyxiate government,
which is the program of Obama, or we change

00:40:32.380 --> 00:40:36.730
direction and
admit we can't pay for civilization with the

00:40:36.730 --> 00:40:40.980
tax system
we have right now, which has a vote of one

00:40:40.980 --> 00:40:42.619
so far.

00:40:42.619 --> 00:40:45.750
But
actually more than one, because I think that

00:40:45.750 --> 00:40:50.390
the Occupy
Wall Street movement is just on target, in

00:40:50.390 --> 00:40:51.390
fact.

00:40:51.390 --> 00:40:55.440
It may
be a little inchoate to the lazy pundits in

00:40:55.440 --> 00:40:58.510
our
mainstream media.

00:40:58.510 --> 00:41:01.230
They may not like painted faces.

00:41:01.230 --> 00:41:04.099
They
may not like kids sleeping in tents.

00:41:04.099 --> 00:41:08.160
But the truth of
the matter is the Occupy Movement is the first

00:41:08.160 --> 00:41:12.070
social
response in this country to a reality that's

00:41:12.070 --> 00:41:17.401
been
underway for 30 years, is serious, real, and

00:41:17.401 --> 00:41:23.069
almost
completely unreflected in our politics.

00:41:23.069 --> 00:41:26.810
My view
moreover, which I expressed in an op ed piece

00:41:26.810 --> 00:41:30.560
in the
Sunday New York Times this past Sunday was

00:41:30.560 --> 00:41:33.270
that the
Occupy Movement in the end is actually going

00:41:33.270 --> 00:41:38.080
to prove to
be something real, more than a sleep in the

00:41:38.080 --> 00:41:39.329
park.

00:41:39.329 --> 00:41:43.059
It's
really going to prove to be a turning point.

00:41:43.059 --> 00:41:47.400
Because
this picture -- while it's possible -- it's

00:41:47.400 --> 00:41:49.290
dreadful.

00:41:49.290 --> 00:41:53.650
And if it happens, America will be a lot worse
than any

00:41:53.650 --> 00:41:59.200
of us wants to imagine as a society.

00:41:59.200 --> 00:42:03.650
And I think there's
a growing realization of this -- though not

00:42:03.650 --> 00:42:07.319
at all yet in
our public rhetoric.

00:42:07.319 --> 00:42:12.540
Our political rhetoric is going to
go one more notch of slashing government probably

00:42:12.540 --> 00:42:15.990
in the
next month or two with this super committee.

00:42:15.990 --> 00:42:18.680
And par for
the course, it's being done behind closed

00:42:18.680 --> 00:42:19.680
doors.

00:42:19.680 --> 00:42:24.360
It's
just the antithesis of democracy -- in my

00:42:24.360 --> 00:42:26.250
view of
everything that's going on.

00:42:26.250 --> 00:42:29.920
And Obama's role is the
antithesis of leadership.

00:42:29.920 --> 00:42:31.060
In my opinion.

00:42:31.060 --> 00:42:34.780
And he's the
guy I support and voted for, mind you.

00:42:34.780 --> 00:42:38.420
I just find him a
profound disappointment in how he's governing.

00:42:38.420 --> 00:42:45.240
So, I
think there is a change that is possible,

00:42:45.240 --> 00:42:52.060
vital, and I'll
just end with what it means if it comes about.

00:42:52.060 --> 00:42:55.660
I
analogize our current situation to roughly

00:42:55.660 --> 00:42:59.329
where we were 100
years ago.

00:42:59.329 --> 00:43:05.630
Maybe fair to say 115 years ago, when the
Progressive Movement started in the United

00:43:05.630 --> 00:43:06.829
States.

00:43:06.829 --> 00:43:09.220
There
was a massive financial crisis, in fact in

00:43:09.220 --> 00:43:13.320
1893, and
that's what brought Williams Jennings Bryant

00:43:13.320 --> 00:43:18.000
to his
famous campaign message that we will not be

00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:20.440
crucified on a
cross of gold.

00:43:20.440 --> 00:43:25.270
And that was the beginning of the
Progressive Movement at the national level

00:43:25.270 --> 00:43:26.450
in fact.

00:43:26.450 --> 00:43:28.720
The
Progressives actually got their president

00:43:28.720 --> 00:43:35.160
with Teddy
Roosevelt in -- after McKinley's assassination.

00:43:35.160 --> 00:43:39.230
And
Roosevelt brought in an era of quite basic

00:43:39.230 --> 00:43:44.560
reform that
tamed the financial industry, ended up creating

00:43:44.560 --> 00:43:49.119
the Fed,
ended up creating the graduated income tax,

00:43:49.119 --> 00:43:53.589
created fair
labor standards, strengthened antitrust legislation.

00:43:53.589 --> 00:43:57.130
In
other words made -- made a lot of campaign

00:43:57.130 --> 00:44:00.701
finance
reforms also, which -- all of which, like

00:44:00.701 --> 00:44:06.130
an arms race, get
beaten by new loopholes and exceptions.

00:44:06.130 --> 00:44:10.589
But in the early
years of the 20th century, played an important

00:44:10.589 --> 00:44:11.900
role.

00:44:11.900 --> 00:44:15.609
Woodrow Wilson was the second great Progressive
president.

00:44:15.609 --> 00:44:22.089
And he presided over the introduction of a
number of the constitutional amendments.

00:44:22.089 --> 00:44:25.820
Also the direct
election of senators, women's suffrage which

00:44:25.820 --> 00:44:29.069
were all
part of the Progressive era.

00:44:29.069 --> 00:44:33.220
I think this is like where
we are right now.

00:44:33.220 --> 00:44:36.940
That movement took 20 years.

00:44:36.940 --> 00:44:40.119
It's not
something that happens overnight.

00:44:40.119 --> 00:44:43.230
It doesn't happen by a
walk in the park.

00:44:43.230 --> 00:44:45.600
That's kind of an opening shot.

00:44:45.600 --> 00:44:49.740
But I
think that this basic idea of the U.S. experiencing

00:44:49.740 --> 00:44:54.280
fundamental socio-political change is real.

00:44:54.280 --> 00:44:57.390
It's happened
three times in the last century.

00:44:57.390 --> 00:45:02.280
The Progressive
Movement, the New Deal, and the 1960s.

00:45:02.280 --> 00:45:05.359
I'm old enough to
have seen that one.

00:45:05.359 --> 00:45:07.150
It was fun.

00:45:07.150 --> 00:45:08.829
It was exciting.

00:45:08.829 --> 00:45:11.060
It
was transformative.

00:45:11.060 --> 00:45:14.119
It created civil rights and women's
rights.

00:45:14.119 --> 00:45:18.500
It opened up society a lot.

00:45:18.500 --> 00:45:20.700
It stuck with me.

00:45:20.700 --> 00:45:23.369
And I think that that's what we're going to
begin to see

00:45:23.369 --> 00:45:24.369
now.

00:45:24.369 --> 00:45:26.140
Thanks very much.

00:45:26.140 --> 00:45:27.140
[Applause].

00:45:27.140 --> 00:45:28.849
&gt;&gt; Jeffrey: Please.

00:45:28.849 --> 00:45:35.030
&gt;&gt; Male #1: Yeah, I guess it's a little weird.

00:45:35.030 --> 00:45:39.309
I graduated from
high school the year before the peak in 1973.

00:45:39.309 --> 00:45:41.559
&gt;&gt; Jeffrey: You're a 72 grad?

00:45:41.559 --> 00:45:44.710
&gt;&gt;Male #1: Yeah
\&gt;&gt;Jeffrey: Yeah, me too.

00:45:44.710 --> 00:45:46.069
&gt;&gt; Male #1: Okay.

00:45:46.069 --> 00:45:53.470
But there's something -- I've had this really
strong impression ever since then, okay?

00:45:53.470 --> 00:45:56.480
In that I
remember before getting out of high school

00:45:56.480 --> 00:45:58.830
and perhaps it
was just I was a kid, but I used to listen

00:45:58.830 --> 00:46:01.369
to politicians
debate stuff.

00:46:01.369 --> 00:46:02.950
And I remember always being a Democrat.

00:46:02.950 --> 00:46:04.960
I
remember thinking, "the Republicans are wrong,

00:46:04.960 --> 00:46:07.570
but
they've got good arguments and what they're

00:46:07.570 --> 00:46:10.560
saying is
reasonable, but they're just wrong."

00:46:10.560 --> 00:46:12.640
People are
sometimes wrong, and they were consistently

00:46:12.640 --> 00:46:13.690
wrong.

00:46:13.690 --> 00:46:16.740
But
the farther I've gotten from sort of getting

00:46:16.740 --> 00:46:22.400
out of high
school, the more and more when I look to that

00:46:22.400 --> 00:46:26.680
side, I
say, "No, it's not that they're wrong, they're

00:46:26.680 --> 00:46:28.330
just
disconnected from reality.

00:46:28.330 --> 00:46:30.089
This stuff doesn't make
sense.

00:46:30.089 --> 00:46:32.120
It's not what I'm being taught in school.

00:46:32.120 --> 00:46:33.230
It's
not what's in the economics books.

00:46:33.230 --> 00:46:35.060
It's not what's in
history books.

00:46:35.060 --> 00:46:38.089
It's just totally disconnected from
reality."

00:46:38.089 --> 00:46:41.941
And so, I guess the question I would ask here,
maybe

00:46:41.941 --> 00:46:44.830
you've told us what happened, okay?

00:46:44.830 --> 00:46:45.830
But why?

00:46:45.830 --> 00:46:47.240
How has it
been possible.

00:46:47.240 --> 00:46:51.869
And for goodness sakes, particularly here
when we talk about the median income, the

00:46:51.869 --> 00:46:55.700
vast majority
of the American people are being totally screwed

00:46:55.700 --> 00:46:57.500
by this
process.

00:46:57.500 --> 00:46:59.640
And they're being told on a regular basis
that

00:46:59.640 --> 00:47:01.670
they're being screwed.

00:47:01.670 --> 00:47:04.309
They're being given this voodoo
economics.

00:47:04.309 --> 00:47:05.369
Ridiculous economics.

00:47:05.369 --> 00:47:06.369
Just insanity.

00:47:06.369 --> 00:47:08.380
Laffer and everybody who came after him.

00:47:08.380 --> 00:47:11.580
People who
were discredited the moment they came out.

00:47:11.580 --> 00:47:16.170
And yet
the -- how can I say this -- the nonsensical

00:47:16.170 --> 00:47:20.040
side of this
debate has been given tremendous respect and

00:47:20.040 --> 00:47:23.010
tremendous
following ever since it began.

00:47:23.010 --> 00:47:26.710
How in the world could
this have happened and how in the world do

00:47:26.710 --> 00:47:30.440
we fight what
appears to be a completely irrational opposition?

00:47:30.440 --> 00:47:32.020
&gt;&gt;Jeffrey: Yeah.

00:47:32.020 --> 00:47:36.990
I think the -- I of course -- I put most of
the

00:47:36.990 --> 00:47:39.320
blame on my side.

00:47:39.320 --> 00:47:40.950
Maybe your side.

00:47:40.950 --> 00:47:47.810
Which is the --
being so ineffective in responding to this.

00:47:47.810 --> 00:47:51.670
And I would
say the Democrats got deeply corrupted in

00:47:51.670 --> 00:47:52.670
this process.

00:47:52.670 --> 00:47:58.819
So when I listen to them, I just see rot rather
than -- I

00:47:58.819 --> 00:48:02.339
see something a little bit more rational,
but this

00:48:02.339 --> 00:48:06.329
stimulus for example -- I thought that was
a preposterous

00:48:06.329 --> 00:48:10.090
response to America's real challenges.

00:48:10.090 --> 00:48:11.090
That's my side.

00:48:11.090 --> 00:48:16.630
What are we packaging within four weeks -- a
900 billion

00:48:16.630 --> 00:48:21.599
dollar mess -- and calling that policy?

00:48:21.599 --> 00:48:25.359
And I said to
President Obama that that is the kind of thing

00:48:25.359 --> 00:48:28.079
that gets
you in trouble, because you prove that you're

00:48:28.079 --> 00:48:32.589
not a
steward of the American people's income.

00:48:32.589 --> 00:48:36.809
It's just --
seems to be throwing money at problems.

00:48:36.809 --> 00:48:40.670
And I argued
with my former colleague Larry Summers about

00:48:40.670 --> 00:48:41.670
this.

00:48:41.670 --> 00:48:43.589
I
disagree strongly with Paul Krugman about

00:48:43.589 --> 00:48:44.589
this.

00:48:44.589 --> 00:48:47.569
I think
the American people look at both sides and

00:48:47.569 --> 00:48:49.900
they don't
understand either side.

00:48:49.900 --> 00:48:55.120
The Republicans do seem to most
Americans to be absolutely antithetical to

00:48:55.120 --> 00:48:58.049
their values
and the American people have it pretty well

00:48:58.049 --> 00:49:02.059
pegged that
the Republican party is in the interest of

00:49:02.059 --> 00:49:03.560
the rich and
the super rich.

00:49:03.560 --> 00:49:07.799
And that's what the opinion surveys show
and the people get it.

00:49:07.799 --> 00:49:11.480
But they don't find the Democrats
giving any answers.

00:49:11.480 --> 00:49:18.130
And so, the sad part of this was it
was Clinton who brought Robert Rubin into

00:49:18.130 --> 00:49:19.130
the White
House.

00:49:19.130 --> 00:49:25.800
Why do we have to have the chairman of Goldman
Sachs come in as treasury secretary, lead

00:49:25.800 --> 00:49:30.309
deregulation and
Glass-Steagall, and then go be Number 2City

00:49:30.309 --> 00:49:31.309
Group.

00:49:31.309 --> 00:49:34.720
On my
side, I don't know.

00:49:34.720 --> 00:49:36.720
But that's inappropriate.

00:49:36.720 --> 00:49:39.390
And so,
the Democrats are deeply tarnished.

00:49:39.390 --> 00:49:44.270
Why you have a
financial crisis and Obama brings in Summers

00:49:44.270 --> 00:49:47.470
who had
presided over this deregulation ten years

00:49:47.470 --> 00:49:48.650
ago.

00:49:48.650 --> 00:49:54.420
Brings in
everybody from the investment banks.

00:49:54.420 --> 00:49:57.130
And every single
senior person in the White House has come

00:49:57.130 --> 00:50:00.109
from an
investment bank basically.

00:50:00.109 --> 00:50:01.720
That's my side.

00:50:01.720 --> 00:50:04.549
So I don't
think that there's a great alternative on

00:50:04.549 --> 00:50:06.760
offer right
now.

00:50:06.760 --> 00:50:13.140
The Republicans, I agree with you -- it's
la la land

00:50:13.140 --> 00:50:16.140
except they know what they're doing.

00:50:16.140 --> 00:50:20.160
You know, they're
playing on a lot of ignorance and propaganda.

00:50:20.160 --> 00:50:23.730
But this
whole anti-climate change thing for example

00:50:23.730 --> 00:50:27.650
-- this is
David Koch, this is the oil industry, this

00:50:27.650 --> 00:50:31.350
is Rupert
Murdock, this is sheer game.

00:50:31.350 --> 00:50:33.540
This isn't a science
debate.

00:50:33.540 --> 00:50:37.619
This is pure corporate propaganda -- period.

00:50:37.619 --> 00:50:38.619
And they're good at it.

00:50:38.619 --> 00:50:45.460
Because they got Roger Ailes at
Fox news who was Nixon's image maker.

00:50:45.460 --> 00:50:49.549
You know, they
know how to do this kind of propaganda.

00:50:49.549 --> 00:50:51.900
But our side
doesn't pick up.

00:50:51.900 --> 00:50:53.270
My side.

00:50:53.270 --> 00:50:57.079
And so, I have to say we got
one far right party and we got one center

00:50:57.079 --> 00:50:58.589
right party.

00:50:58.589 --> 00:51:01.650
And we've got the rest of America scratching
their heads

00:51:01.650 --> 00:51:05.060
saying, "we don't like Washington, because
nobody's

00:51:05.060 --> 00:51:07.109
representing us."

00:51:07.109 --> 00:51:13.450
And that to my mind is the biggest
problem that -- you know, one side is really,

00:51:13.450 --> 00:51:16.010
as I said
and I think you feel it the same way from

00:51:16.010 --> 00:51:20.980
a moral point of
view -- completely un-understandable from

00:51:20.980 --> 00:51:28.970
the perspective
of the most -- just modicum of decency, compassion,

00:51:28.970 --> 00:51:32.390
basic
standards of values -- but the other side

00:51:32.390 --> 00:51:33.390
is dishonest.

00:51:33.390 --> 00:51:37.310
&gt;&gt;Male #1: If what you're saying is right,
I spent most of my

00:51:37.310 --> 00:51:42.160
youth growing up overseas -- places like Ethiopia
during

00:51:42.160 --> 00:51:48.089
revolutions, in Berlin when the Russians were
-- when the

00:51:48.089 --> 00:51:51.000
government becomes that disconnected from
the people.

00:51:51.000 --> 00:51:54.571
&gt;&gt; Jeffrey: And it's the right and the duty
of the people to

00:51:54.571 --> 00:51:55.849
overturn it I think is the expression.

00:51:55.849 --> 00:52:01.390
&gt;&gt; Male #1: There is only one thing that happens.

00:52:01.390 --> 00:52:03.880
That is not
just people sitting in the park.

00:52:03.880 --> 00:52:05.339
That is violence.

00:52:05.339 --> 00:52:06.920
How
do we avoid that?

00:52:06.920 --> 00:52:13.790
&gt;&gt; Jeffrey: My belief is that we've had -- I
hope we do.

00:52:13.790 --> 00:52:18.950
I think
that the path that we're on is incredibly

00:52:18.950 --> 00:52:21.560
dangerous.

00:52:21.560 --> 00:52:24.660
And
I think the way we avoid it most likely is

00:52:24.660 --> 00:52:30.259
to come
together around a set of proposals -- a platform

00:52:30.259 --> 00:52:34.760
-- and
elect candidates that are going to carry that

00:52:34.760 --> 00:52:36.030
out.

00:52:36.030 --> 00:52:38.799
Our
structural problem is our politics on both

00:52:38.799 --> 00:52:41.000
sides are on
the take.

00:52:41.000 --> 00:52:47.040
And so, they're not offering the median
voter -- answer their happily duopoly on the

00:52:47.040 --> 00:52:51.700
right of
keeping taxes low and slashing the rest of

00:52:51.700 --> 00:52:52.920
government.

00:52:52.920 --> 00:52:56.400
And that's kind of a safe comfortable incumbent
duopoly

00:52:56.400 --> 00:52:59.870
that's not capturing the center.

00:52:59.870 --> 00:53:04.089
I think a good
political entrepreneur who's clever could

00:53:04.089 --> 00:53:10.390
capture the
center and capture power or political movement

00:53:10.390 --> 00:53:11.750
could do
so.

00:53:11.750 --> 00:53:16.220
The trick is big money can't do that and won't
do

00:53:16.220 --> 00:53:17.240
that.

00:53:17.240 --> 00:53:20.790
So my view, structurally, is that the solution
is,

00:53:20.790 --> 00:53:27.299
"How do you run and win power without campaign
contributions?"

00:53:27.299 --> 00:53:31.599
That to my mind is the real structural
challenge.

00:53:31.599 --> 00:53:34.920
And my view is that it's possible these days.

00:53:34.920 --> 00:53:38.030
If everyone's got their Androids.

00:53:38.030 --> 00:53:39.160
If everyone's
tweeting.

00:53:39.160 --> 00:53:46.000
If everyone is using YouTube and Facebook
and

00:53:46.000 --> 00:53:49.740
every social network -- what we ought to do
is create a

00:53:49.740 --> 00:53:55.200
platform that is the free campaign platform
-- the whole

00:53:55.200 --> 00:53:57.290
social media platform.

00:53:57.290 --> 00:54:04.330
You have a message, we'll retweet
it a million times in a day.

00:54:04.330 --> 00:54:07.170
We'll make sure that videos
go viral.

00:54:07.170 --> 00:54:11.599
We'll use Facebook network that's created
of a

00:54:11.599 --> 00:54:16.540
nationwide friends of progressive ideas.

00:54:16.540 --> 00:54:21.380
And enable
candidates to run without being on the take.

00:54:21.380 --> 00:54:24.840
So that's
the revolution in campaign tactics that I

00:54:24.840 --> 00:54:27.670
think could be
the breakthrough.

00:54:27.670 --> 00:54:33.380
And then, if the platform is right,
then I think the rest can follow.

00:54:33.380 --> 00:54:36.370
That's my strategy.

00:54:36.370 --> 00:54:38.160
What do you think?

00:54:38.160 --> 00:54:39.160
You ready?

00:54:39.160 --> 00:54:41.549
&gt;&gt; Male #1: The Internet will set you free?

00:54:41.549 --> 00:54:42.690
[laughter]
&gt;&gt; Jeffrey: Yes.

00:54:42.690 --> 00:54:43.710
What do you think, guys?

00:54:43.710 --> 00:54:44.710
You're Google.

00:54:44.710 --> 00:54:45.710
[Applause].

00:54:45.710 --> 00:54:47.349
&gt;&gt; Jeffrey: All right.

00:54:47.349 --> 00:54:50.930
Can you guys make the right platform?

00:54:50.930 --> 00:54:53.710
Google dot democracy.org?

00:54:53.710 --> 00:54:56.720
All right.

00:54:56.720 --> 00:54:59.380
We may tax you a
little bit more in the meantime also, but.

00:54:59.380 --> 00:55:01.569
&gt;&gt; Male #2: Jeffrey, thank you for being here.

00:55:01.569 --> 00:55:04.109
Thank you for
showing all these graphs.

00:55:04.109 --> 00:55:08.220
You talked about your
admiration for the northern European countries

00:55:08.220 --> 00:55:09.650
and Korea
in particular.

00:55:09.650 --> 00:55:13.250
I don't know if you have the information here.

00:55:13.250 --> 00:55:17.019
Will you be able to share some of those
graphs or --

00:55:17.019 --> 00:55:18.140
&gt;&gt; Jeffrey: Yeah yeah.

00:55:18.140 --> 00:55:19.330
Let me just show you one thing.

00:55:19.330 --> 00:55:20.630
&gt;&gt; Male #2: Thank you.

00:55:20.630 --> 00:55:21.990
&gt;&gt; Jeffrey: Yeah.

00:55:21.990 --> 00:55:25.930
Actually, let me show you one thing.

00:55:25.930 --> 00:55:28.089
We watch
a lot of TV in this country.

00:55:28.089 --> 00:55:31.690
That's a little bit of a
distraction, but I think it actually is part

00:55:31.690 --> 00:55:34.160
of our
distraction as well.

00:55:34.160 --> 00:55:41.560
And the countries that I really
like are on the -- well, Italy, that's interesting.

00:55:41.560 --> 00:55:43.619
[laughter]

00:55:43.619 --> 00:55:44.940
But okay.

00:55:44.940 --> 00:55:51.359
Let me show you the -- 
here's the

00:55:51.359 --> 00:55:54.700
big difference of what happened in this country.

00:55:54.700 --> 00:56:01.079
And
what happened in the rest of -- in other places.

00:56:01.079 --> 00:56:05.410
So
basically, on the left-hand side is the change

00:56:05.410 --> 00:56:11.970
--
arithmetic change -- of tax to GNP ratio compared

00:56:11.970 --> 00:56:17.010
to 2008
minus 1965.

00:56:17.010 --> 00:56:21.540
So it's the rise of the tax share of
national income.

00:56:21.540 --> 00:56:26.710
And you can see that every high income
country has higher tax collections as a share

00:56:26.710 --> 00:56:32.070
of GNP than
the mid 1960s except for one country.

00:56:32.070 --> 00:56:33.609
That's us all the
way at the end.

00:56:33.609 --> 00:56:38.420
We're the only country that resisted
raising revenues in this country.

00:56:38.420 --> 00:56:40.570
That's the whole story that
I'm talking about.

00:56:40.570 --> 00:56:43.700
We decided we're not going to pay for
government.

00:56:43.700 --> 00:56:45.790
Everyone else pays for government.

00:56:45.790 --> 00:56:49.600
And the
social democracies had very -- they were already

00:56:49.600 --> 00:56:51.890
high and
they had big increases.

00:56:51.890 --> 00:56:56.170
The result was that the United
States, for example, just in one category

00:56:56.170 --> 00:56:58.480
-- social
spending -- this includes some of the transfer

00:56:58.480 --> 00:56:59.890
programs.

00:56:59.890 --> 00:57:03.940
We have the lowest level of social spending
of any

00:57:03.940 --> 00:57:04.940
country.

00:57:04.940 --> 00:57:09.240
This is basically Medicare/Medicaid, Social
Security, food stamps.

00:57:09.240 --> 00:57:16.859
Sweden, Denmark, Belgium, Austria,
France -- they're 10 percentage points of

00:57:16.859 --> 00:57:19.470
GDP higher than
we are.

00:57:19.470 --> 00:57:23.350
The countries that I really admire most in
their

00:57:23.350 --> 00:57:29.950
performance are Netherlands, Sweden, Finland
-- Norway,

00:57:29.950 --> 00:57:36.600
Sweden, Finland, Denmark, Netherlands, Germany.

00:57:36.600 --> 00:57:40.120
In
general, they're spending 10 percent of GDP

00:57:40.120 --> 00:57:42.060
more than
the United States.

00:57:42.060 --> 00:57:47.240
They're taxing about 15 percentage
points of GDP more than the United States,

00:57:47.240 --> 00:57:50.490
because they
also don't run a budget deficit.

00:57:50.490 --> 00:57:54.920
So they're spending a
lot and they're paying their way.

00:57:54.920 --> 00:57:57.900
And life is really
nice in those countries by the way.

00:57:57.900 --> 00:58:00.299
There's no poverty.

00:58:00.299 --> 00:58:03.040
Everybody gets five or six weeks of paid vacation.

00:58:03.040 --> 00:58:05.180
Of
course, it's paid within the context of their

00:58:05.180 --> 00:58:07.339
jobs and
the state.

00:58:07.339 --> 00:58:12.400
Everybody gets maternity and paternity leave
for several months.

00:58:12.400 --> 00:58:14.440
Nobody gets super rich.

00:58:14.440 --> 00:58:17.109
There's
some inherited wealth, but nobody gets super

00:58:17.109 --> 00:58:18.109
rich.

00:58:18.109 --> 00:58:20.619
That's the price that they pay.

00:58:20.619 --> 00:58:27.619
That's what they want,
which is a society of high affluence, very

00:58:27.619 --> 00:58:36.170
superb
education, very competitive industries, internationally

00:58:36.170 --> 00:58:40.240
competitive industries, highly innovative.

00:58:40.240 --> 00:58:43.410
They pay a
lot of government spending for the innovation.

00:58:43.410 --> 00:58:46.770
So Sweden
invests very heavily of public funds as well

00:58:46.770 --> 00:58:50.030
as having
companies like Ericsson and others that are

00:58:50.030 --> 00:58:54.180
doing private
sector innovation.

00:58:54.180 --> 00:59:04.359
And they paid for it basically by --
our taxes are, right now, 27 percent of GDP.

00:59:04.359 --> 00:59:07.799
In the normal
time before 2008 were our taxes were about

00:59:07.799 --> 00:59:10.880
30 percent of
GDP.

00:59:10.880 --> 00:59:15.820
Sweden, Denmark, Norway, Finland, Netherlands
about 45

00:59:15.820 --> 00:59:17.620
percent of GDP.

00:59:17.620 --> 00:59:21.039
It's a whole different environment.

00:59:21.039 --> 00:59:23.849
The
main difference by the way is that in those

00:59:23.849 --> 00:59:28.540
countries
there's a lot of support for families.

00:59:28.540 --> 00:59:30.039
There's day care.

00:59:30.039 --> 00:59:32.020
There's maternity leave.

00:59:32.020 --> 00:59:37.040
There's help for low skilled
households.

00:59:37.040 --> 00:59:41.069
There's early childhood development support.

00:59:41.069 --> 00:59:44.960
There's more investment for poor children
in schooling.

00:59:44.960 --> 00:59:50.440
They don't let anyone fall away.

00:59:50.440 --> 00:59:56.740
And the result is
evident when you live there as I have in Sweden

00:59:56.740 --> 01:00:00.180
or when
you visit, which is infrastructure is very

01:00:00.180 --> 01:00:03.210
well
maintained, education levels are uniformly

01:00:03.210 --> 01:00:06.960
high, there
are no pockets of poverty and there's very

01:00:06.960 --> 01:00:08.819
high social
mobility.

01:00:08.819 --> 01:00:13.140
Whereas, by the way the other shocking thing
about the United States -- let me show you

01:00:13.140 --> 01:00:14.289
one more
graph.

01:00:14.289 --> 01:00:17.089
I'm going to have to stop, also, and I know
you do

01:00:17.089 --> 01:00:19.760
as well.

01:00:19.760 --> 01:00:25.930
This is a graph showing the correlation of
parental educational attainment and children's

01:00:25.930 --> 01:00:29.670
educational attainment in the OECD countries.

01:00:29.670 --> 01:00:36.170
So a high
correlation means of course highly educated

01:00:36.170 --> 01:00:39.839
parents raise
children who end up with high educational

01:00:39.839 --> 01:00:40.839
attainment.

01:00:40.839 --> 01:00:44.480
Low education parents end up the opposite.

01:00:44.480 --> 01:00:48.099
The countries
over on the left with the lowest correlation

01:00:48.099 --> 01:00:52.230
or as
shorthand very high educational mobility

01:00:52.230 --> 01:00:58.220
intergenerationally -- Finland, Iceland, Norway,
Canada.

01:00:58.220 --> 01:01:04.280
The United States actually has the highest
intergenerational correlation at this point.

01:01:04.280 --> 01:01:08.310
So we pride
ourselves as being very highly socially mobile.

01:01:08.310 --> 01:01:10.589
But if
you're born to a family where your parents

01:01:10.589 --> 01:01:13.369
don't have
a high school degree the chance that you're

01:01:13.369 --> 01:01:17.180
going to
graduate Bachelor's degree in this country,

01:01:17.180 --> 01:01:20.170
probably under
10%.

01:01:20.170 --> 01:01:21.349
You just can't make it.

01:01:21.349 --> 01:01:25.760
The combination of
the poverty, the lack of social support, the

01:01:25.760 --> 01:01:29.940
neighborhood
factors, the intra-familial factors.

01:01:29.940 --> 01:01:32.349
The high tuition
rates.

01:01:32.349 --> 01:01:35.839
So this is why we're ending up really as the
most

01:01:35.839 --> 01:01:39.309
stratified of all of these countries.

01:01:39.309 --> 01:01:43.400
Because we don't
invest in any of this equalization.

01:01:43.400 --> 01:01:47.510
And that I think is
going to be our killer.

01:01:47.510 --> 01:01:52.450
The data just came out -- if
you're a Hispanic young man in this country

01:01:52.450 --> 01:02:00.789
-- 25 to
29 -- only 11 percent have a Bachelor's degree.

01:02:00.789 --> 01:02:06.760
African-American young man -- 25 to 29 -- 16
percent.

01:02:06.760 --> 01:02:09.430
In
this society, in a world economy, what kind

01:02:09.430 --> 01:02:14.490
of incomes,
jobs, life prospects does that mean?

01:02:14.490 --> 01:02:17.350
Very poor.

01:02:17.350 --> 01:02:18.839
Very
unstable.

01:02:18.839 --> 01:02:20.829
Very erratic.

01:02:20.829 --> 01:02:22.380
And you know?

01:02:22.380 --> 01:02:24.710
Some people say
that's fine.

01:02:24.710 --> 01:02:30.730
But I think what it's going to mean for the
corrosion of our society is extremely serious.

01:02:30.730 --> 01:02:33.670
And I
think the process is already begun.

01:02:33.670 --> 01:02:37.119
And it wouldn't take
a revolution to correct this.

01:02:37.119 --> 01:02:41.540
It would just take a few
percent of GDP to correct it.

01:02:41.540 --> 01:02:42.900
That's the beauty of it.

01:02:42.900 --> 01:02:44.920
And the question is, "are we going to wait
till there is

01:02:44.920 --> 01:02:50.670
an explosion or are we actually going to correct
it?"

01:02:50.670 --> 01:02:54.920
I
was reading last night about the Bonus Army

01:02:54.920 --> 01:02:59.170
in the Great
Depression when the veterans were demanding

01:02:59.170 --> 01:03:03.240
some help in
1932.

01:03:03.240 --> 01:03:05.940
Hoover sent in the troops.

01:03:05.940 --> 01:03:09.490
And many people were
killed and wounded.

01:03:09.490 --> 01:03:18.900
And then, in 1933, they struck again
and Roosevelt sent Eleanor Roosevelt to the

01:03:18.900 --> 01:03:20.119
camp.

01:03:20.119 --> 01:03:24.349
And
she discussed and negotiated with them and

01:03:24.349 --> 01:03:27.730
they made a
program so that the veterans would get jobs

01:03:27.730 --> 01:03:32.369
in the CCC,
the Civilian Conservation Corps.

01:03:32.369 --> 01:03:35.369
And the line that came
out of it was "Hoover sent the troops and

01:03:35.369 --> 01:03:37.820
Roosevelt sent
his wife".

01:03:37.820 --> 01:03:41.130
And it's the kind of society we want.

01:03:41.130 --> 01:03:43.299
If
we're clearing the parks with police with

01:03:43.299 --> 01:03:46.580
batons, we're
going to end up in the Hoover world.

01:03:46.580 --> 01:03:50.549
And, if we send the
Eleanor Roosevelts of the world and try to

01:03:50.549 --> 01:03:52.500
figure out
something, we're going to end up with some

01:03:52.500 --> 01:03:53.500
decency.

01:03:53.500 --> 01:03:54.500
Thank you very much.

01:03:54.500 --> 01:03:54.520
[Applause]
