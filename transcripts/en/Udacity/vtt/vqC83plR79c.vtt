00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Al right, so inertial frame of reference means constant speed or at rest,

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
though we can't really distinguish between the two we decided.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:14.000
Well, a car parked on the ground--definitely at rest--likewise, a plane flying at a constant velocity.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:20.000
This object in free fall is going to move downwards at constant acceleration but not constant speed.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
And likewise, with the bike. All right, so we've got the first postulate.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000
The first postulate of special relativity in this idea that the laws of

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
physics are the same in inertial frames.

00:00:29.000 --> 09:59:59.000
Before we move on, let's go back to our train.
