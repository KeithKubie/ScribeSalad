00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:05.742
So let's talk about magnetic disks, which today usually means a hard disk, or a

00:00:05.742 --> 00:00:09.300
hard drive. But the so-called floppy disks are

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:12.290
also magnetic disks, and work very much along

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:14.960
the same lines. It's just that today we

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:18.100
mostly have hard drives, and few people even

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:22.290
remember floppy drives. A magnetic disk has a

00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:26.806
spindle to which we can attach so-called platters.

00:00:26.806 --> 00:00:29.302
All of the platters are attached to the

00:00:29.302 --> 00:00:32.110
same spindle and rotate at the same speed,

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:34.790
let's say in this direction. There is a

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:37.886
motor here that really drives the spindle to rotate

00:00:37.886 --> 00:00:43.350
and that causes all the platters to rotate at the same speed. If we look at the

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:47.380
single platter it has a surface covered with

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:52.730
magnetic material on one side and also on another.

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:55.086
So this drive that has three platters

00:00:55.086 --> 00:00:58.390
usually will have total of six surfaces. The

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:06.310
data bits are on all the surfaces. We access this data by having a magnetic head

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:12.210
attached to an arm and another one for the lower surface. And then all of these

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:17.890
heads are attached to a head assembly which can move all the heads in unison.

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:20.018
So if this head is here, this head

00:01:20.018 --> 00:01:23.134
will be in the same position on another platter,

00:01:23.134 --> 00:01:26.120
and so on. We don't individually move the heads,

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:28.750
we move them all at the same time. So

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:32.265
because the platter is rotating and the head

00:01:32.265 --> 00:01:35.875
is staying in place usually, the head will be

00:01:35.875 --> 00:01:39.295
able to access this circle on the surface of

00:01:39.295 --> 00:01:43.470
the disk. Each head will be able to access

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:49.270
the circle on its own surface, and all of these are going to be at the same

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:56.388
distance from the spindle. This is called a track. All of the tracks

00:01:56.388 --> 00:01:59.085
at the same distance from the spindle

00:01:59.085 --> 00:02:02.843
form what is called a cylinder. The cylinder

00:02:02.843 --> 00:02:05.499
simply consists of one track from each

00:02:05.499 --> 00:02:08.651
surface where the tracks in the cylinders are

00:02:08.651 --> 00:02:11.807
those that can be accessed by different heads

00:02:11.807 --> 00:02:14.808
at the same time. So for example here,

00:02:14.808 --> 00:02:17.112
there are six heads. When they stay in

00:02:17.112 --> 00:02:20.689
this position and all the platters rotate, they're able

00:02:20.689 --> 00:02:23.950
to access the six racks of that cylinder.

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:27.140
The way we access different tracks on the

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:30.310
disk is by moving the head so that

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:33.950
it comes closer or gets further from the spindle.

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:36.050
And that way we can access the entire

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:39.780
area of each surface. So the data, naturally, will

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:44.020
be organized into bits that are positioned along

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:47.550
the track, and then another track will have different

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:52.419
bits and so on. If you look at the surface from above, and this is now the

00:02:52.419 --> 00:02:55.290
spindle, this is would be one track and

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:59.014
this would be another. And finally on one track

00:02:59.014 --> 00:03:03.238
we don't store data continuously through the track

00:03:03.238 --> 00:03:06.022
because usually a lot of bits are on

00:03:06.022 --> 00:03:09.478
a single track, instead the data along one

00:03:09.478 --> 00:03:14.000
track is divided into sectors. And a sector

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:18.527
will be the smallest unit that we can actually read. Now if the disk rotates in

00:03:18.527 --> 00:03:21.341
this direction, and the head is currently here,

00:03:21.341 --> 00:03:24.155
as the disk rotates, different bits of the sector

00:03:24.155 --> 00:03:26.640
are going to be under the head. So the

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:29.304
sector will have some preamble here that is

00:03:29.304 --> 00:03:32.190
a recognizable bit pattern that tells the head

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:35.250
that this is the beginning of a sector.

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:38.330
Then we have the appropriate number of the

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:41.410
bits for the sector that actually hold the

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:45.194
data, followed usually by some checksum and other

00:03:45.194 --> 00:03:49.242
information that is needed to possibly correct errors

00:03:49.242 --> 00:03:52.500
in the sector. And then another sector would just

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:54.710
have the same things and so on. So when

00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:58.280
the head assembly moves to a particular cylinder, then

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:02.000
the heads start listening for the beginning of the sector.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.160
Once they see the beginning of the sector and

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:06.960
see which sector it is, they know where they

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:10.475
are in the whole track. So the disk capacity

00:04:10.475 --> 00:04:15.000
can be computed as the number of platters times 2.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:20.779
This will really be the number of surfaces times how many tracks we have per

00:04:20.779 --> 00:04:25.030
surface. Or expressed in another way how many

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:28.464
cylinders do we have on these disks times

00:04:28.464 --> 00:04:34.221
how many sectors do we have per track times how many bytes of data do we

00:04:34.221 --> 00:04:39.946
have in each sector. Usually we have a small number of platters, such as one,

00:04:39.946 --> 00:04:43.910
two, three, maybe four. We have thousands

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:47.682
of tracks per surface, tens to hundreds sectors

00:04:47.682 --> 00:04:51.086
per track, and something like a kilobyte or

00:04:51.086 --> 00:04:53.846
maybe a half of kilobyte of bytes per

00:04:53.846 --> 00:04:57.255
sector. So sectors are usually like kilobytish

00:04:57.255 --> 00:05:00.690
in size. We have about 100, let's say,

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:02.970
sectors per track, maybe a little bit more,

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:05.680
and we have thousands of tracks per surface.

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:08.446
Obviously, the whole thing needs to be very thin

00:05:08.446 --> 00:05:12.055
so these platters are really close to each other.

00:05:12.055 --> 00:05:14.535
It needs to be, let's say, two and a

00:05:14.535 --> 00:05:18.375
half inches wide total, including the head assembly and

00:05:18.375 --> 00:05:21.198
so on. So the platters are only a couple

00:05:21.198 --> 00:05:24.222
of inches in diameter and because we have so

00:05:24.222 --> 00:05:27.750
many tracks per surface that means that the tracks

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:30.942
are spaced very, very close to each other and

00:05:30.942 --> 00:05:36.360
the head assembly needs to be very, very precise in how it positions heads.
