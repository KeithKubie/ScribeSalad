00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:02.440
The first question you'll probably ask yourself at this

00:00:02.440 --> 00:00:04.890
point. How do I access App Engine in the

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:07.490
first place? Well that is a pretty important question

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:09.760
to answer. And we're happy to tell you that it's

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:13.720
super easy. So first of all, here you are.

00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:17.190
A star developer. And you should already have a

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:21.410
Google account, that you probably use for many different

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:25.390
Google services. Such as Gmail, YouTube, Google Plus, et cetera.

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:29.690
Well, guess what? Your standard Google account also allows you

00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:32.540
to create app engine applications that run on the Google

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:36.090
cloud platform. So there is no additional account required. What

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:38.590
you do is simply log on to the developers console

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:41.450
that we will go through later. And register the App

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:45.120
Engine applications you want to create. And once you've done

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:48.050
that, the time has come for you to create those

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:51.170
great cloud applications. So you need to sit down, and

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:54.190
hack, and hack. And hack, and hack until you

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:57.070
have something awesome that you want to test. And then

00:00:57.070 --> 00:00:59.310
you can fire up an instance of App Engine, which

00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:02.690
runs on your local development machine. And that is of

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:05.620
course, great. Since it allows you to use all your

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:09.150
standard tools. Such as debuggers and providers to get those

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:12.740
bugs out. And once you've done that, it's time to

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:16.340
run your applications on computers in the Google data centers.

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:17.920
So, with just a click or two, you can

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:20.961
deploy all of that great code to App Engine. And

00:01:20.961 --> 00:01:24.670
of course, you can have many applications running there. And

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:27.670
when you and your front-end developer friend have finished your

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:30.850
application. You tell all your users about how cool

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:33.650
it is, and that they can start using it. And

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:36.970
when you use App Engine, it's very easy to support

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:41.330
any kind of device and operating system. Computers, smartphones, tablet's.

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:44.650
You name it. And hopefully, the users will think

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:47.740
your application is so cool, that they will tell their

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:50.660
friends about how cool it is. And hopefully they will

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:54.660
tell their friends. And your application goes all viral. And

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:57.800
you get all of these great ratings and recognitions. And

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:01.100
awards and stuff. But you don't need to worry about

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:04.280
your site going down because it has become so popular,

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:06.390
since you built it on the Google cloud. It will

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:10.990
scale and scale, and scale on the Google infrastructure.

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:13.020
So you get to feel like a million bucks. And

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:16.120
become a rock start developer that everyone wants to be

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:19.850
with. This is exactly what we would like to happen.

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:22.780
And that's really what this is all about. App Engine

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:26.470
and Google cloud platform, allows you to create applications that

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:28.990
run in Google data centers. And can be used by

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:31.860
any device. So you can sit with your laptop and

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:34.270
create apps that scale to serve billions of

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:37.270
users worldwide. It's really, really cool when you think

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:39.950
about it. Well, hang in there. Because you're

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:42.670
just about to create your first App Engine project.
