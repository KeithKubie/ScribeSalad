00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:03.889
 
it's a fairly natural question if you're

00:00:03.889 --> 00:00:03.899
it's a fairly natural question if you're
 

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:05.329
it's a fairly natural question if you're
looking at the sequence of prime numbers

00:00:05.329 --> 00:00:05.339
looking at the sequence of prime numbers
 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:09.560
looking at the sequence of prime numbers
say P whinings 2 P 2 s 3 and so on how

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:09.570
say P whinings 2 P 2 s 3 and so on how
 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:13.039
say P whinings 2 P 2 s 3 and so on how
big do these gaps get and we know that

00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:13.049
big do these gaps get and we know that
 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:15.829
big do these gaps get and we know that
actually the gaps can get pretty big so

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:15.839
actually the gaps can get pretty big so
 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:17.660
actually the gaps can get pretty big so
there's a very high school argument that

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:17.670
there's a very high school argument that
 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:24.500
there's a very high school argument that
if you take numbers 1 x 2 x 3 up to z

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:24.510
if you take numbers 1 x 2 x 3 up to z
 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:26.929
if you take numbers 1 x 2 x 3 up to z
times 100 and then you look at this

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939
times 100 and then you look at this
 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:29.630
times 100 and then you look at this
number plus 2 this is going to be a

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640
number plus 2 this is going to be a
 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:32.479
number plus 2 this is going to be a
multiple of 2 because these a multiple

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489
multiple of 2 because these a multiple
 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:34.549
multiple of 2 because these a multiple
of 2 and this first big number of

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559
of 2 and this first big number of
 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:36.319
of 2 and this first big number of
product of numbers between 1 and a

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329
product of numbers between 1 and a
 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:37.910
product of numbers between 1 and a
hundred is Markel t another way that

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920
hundred is Markel t another way that
 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.639
hundred is Markel t another way that
mathematicians might like this is 100

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649
mathematicians might like this is 100
 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:44.000
mathematicians might like this is 100
exclamation mark plus 2 so this is

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010
exclamation mark plus 2 so this is
 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:45.560
exclamation mark plus 2 so this is
multiplied all numbers up to 100

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570
multiplied all numbers up to 100
 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:47.779
multiplied all numbers up to 100
together and then add to but then

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789
together and then add to but then
 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:50.930
together and then add to but then
exactly the same argument means that 100

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940
exactly the same argument means that 100
 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.630
exactly the same argument means that 100
factorial plus 3 is going to be a

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640
factorial plus 3 is going to be a
 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.299
factorial plus 3 is going to be a
multiple of 3 and so implicit 100

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309
multiple of 3 and so implicit 100
 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:58.189
multiple of 3 and so implicit 100
factorial plus 2 can't be prime because

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199
factorial plus 2 can't be prime because
 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:00:59.330
factorial plus 2 can't be prime because
it's a multiple of 2 and it's bigger

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340
it's a multiple of 2 and it's bigger
 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:01.910
it's a multiple of 2 and it's bigger
than 200 factorial plus 3 can't be prime

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920
than 200 factorial plus 3 can't be prime
 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.579
than 200 factorial plus 3 can't be prime
because it's a multiple of 3 and bigger

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589
because it's a multiple of 3 and bigger
 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:07.100
because it's a multiple of 3 and bigger
than 3 and similarly you can go all the

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110
than 3 and similarly you can go all the
 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:12.109
than 3 and similarly you can go all the
way on to 100 factorial plus 100 and

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119
way on to 100 factorial plus 100 and
 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:14.539
way on to 100 factorial plus 100 and
this can't be applied because it's a

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549
this can't be applied because it's a
 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:18.020
this can't be applied because it's a
model of 100 and bigger than 100 and so

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030
model of 100 and bigger than 100 and so
 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:21.289
model of 100 and bigger than 100 and so
this is 99 consecutive numbers none of

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299
this is 99 consecutive numbers none of
 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:23.390
this is 99 consecutive numbers none of
which can be prime numbers and so you

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400
which can be prime numbers and so you
 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.910
which can be prime numbers and so you
know that there has to be this gap

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920
know that there has to be this gap
 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:27.560
know that there has to be this gap
between plant numbers of size at least

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570
between plant numbers of size at least
 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:30.649
between plant numbers of size at least
100 but obviously you can replace the

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659
100 but obviously you can replace the
 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:32.990
100 but obviously you can replace the
hunger here with any number you like and

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000
hunger here with any number you like and
 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.030
hunger here with any number you like and
that shows that there are arbitrarily

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040
that shows that there are arbitrarily
 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.160
that shows that there are arbitrarily
large gaps cream prime numbers it seems

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170
large gaps cream prime numbers it seems
 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:38.660
large gaps cream prime numbers it seems
to make you physically you've done

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670
to make you physically you've done
 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:40.100
to make you physically you've done
approach it you've proven that they were

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110
approach it you've proven that they were
 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:43.700
approach it you've proven that they were
right so this is completely a rigorous

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710
right so this is completely a rigorous
 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:46.219
right so this is completely a rigorous
mathematical proof that whatever number

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229
mathematical proof that whatever number
 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:48.530
mathematical proof that whatever number
you like taking a million take a billion

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540
you like taking a million take a billion
 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:52.399
you like taking a million take a billion
there exists a prime gap which is bigger

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409
there exists a prime gap which is bigger
 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:54.020
there exists a prime gap which is bigger
than a billion or bigger than a million

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030
than a billion or bigger than a million
 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:55.460
than a billion or bigger than a million
or bigger than a billion billion billion

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470
or bigger than a billion billion billion
 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:57.170
or bigger than a billion billion billion
or bigger than the number of atoms in

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180
or bigger than the number of atoms in
 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:58.880
or bigger than the number of atoms in
the universe and so there are these

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890
the universe and so there are these
 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:02.209
the universe and so there are these
really huge gap screen prime numbers but

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:02.219
really huge gap screen prime numbers but
 

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:03.950
really huge gap screen prime numbers but
the prime numbers where these gaps occur

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960
the prime numbers where these gaps occur
 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:06.830
the prime numbers where these gaps occur
and may be really huge themselves and

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840
and may be really huge themselves and
 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:08.660
and may be really huge themselves and
then there's this question those two

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670
then there's this question those two
 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:12.680
then there's this question those two
okay if I have a phone number of about a

how big can the gap stream prime numbers

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:17.430
how big can the gap stream prime numbers
 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:19.369
how big can the gap stream prime numbers
be for example if you're trying to find

subsides about a militant one way you
might try and go about it is take a

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:27.870
might try and go about it is take a
 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:30.050
might try and go about it is take a
million try and test if it's prime if

pretty good way of finding prime numbers

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:41.970
pretty good way of finding prime numbers
 

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:43.729
pretty good way of finding prime numbers

understanding of this is pretty poor at
 

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:58.699
understanding of this is pretty poor at
the moment and it could be the case that

00:02:58.699 --> 00:02:58.709

you find a prime number if there were

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:02.760
you find a prime number if there were

these really large gaps between prime
 

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:05.930
these really large gaps between prime
numbers so you want to make sure that

would completely screw up your attempt

00:03:16.729 --> 00:03:16.739
would completely screw up your attempt
 

00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:18.860
would completely screw up your attempt

about the gaps to claim so it's a

00:07:42.050 --> 00:07:42.060
about the gaps to claim so it's a
 

00:07:42.060 --> 00:07:44.030
about the gaps to claim so it's a
slightly technical statement but I'll

00:07:44.030 --> 00:07:44.040
slightly technical statement but I'll
 

00:07:44.040 --> 00:07:45.890
slightly technical statement but I'll
try and write it out for you so if you

00:07:45.890 --> 00:07:45.900
try and write it out for you so if you
 

00:07:45.900 --> 00:07:48.290
try and write it out for you so if you
look at primes less than X so I'm

00:07:48.290 --> 00:07:48.300
look at primes less than X so I'm
 

00:07:48.300 --> 00:07:50.660
look at primes less than X so I'm
thinking of X has been some huge number

00:07:50.660 --> 00:07:50.670
thinking of X has been some huge number
 

00:07:50.670 --> 00:07:52.820

like a billion or the number of atoms in

00:07:52.820 --> 00:07:52.830
like a billion or the number of atoms in
 

00:07:52.830 --> 00:07:57.350
like a billion or the number of atoms in
the universe then there is a gap of size

00:07:57.350 --> 00:07:57.360
the universe then there is a gap of size
 

00:07:57.360 --> 00:08:00.080
the universe then there is a gap of size
and now we have some big messy

00:08:00.080 --> 00:08:00.090
and now we have some big messy
 

00:08:00.090 --> 00:08:03.050
and now we have some big messy
expression involving lots of logarithms

00:08:03.050 --> 00:08:03.060
expression involving lots of logarithms
 

00:08:03.060 --> 00:08:09.410
expression involving lots of logarithms
so log x times log of log of x times log

00:08:09.410 --> 00:08:09.420
so log x times log of log of x times log
 

00:08:09.420 --> 00:08:17.630
so log x times log of log of x times log
of log of log of log of X divided by log

00:08:17.630 --> 00:08:17.640
of log of log of log of X divided by log

of log of log of log of X divided by log
of log of log of x times some small

00:08:23.990 --> 00:08:24.000
of log of log of x times some small
 

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:31.310
of log of log of x times some small
constant C if X is large and so this is

00:08:31.310 --> 00:08:31.320
constant C if X is large and so this is
 

00:08:31.320 --> 00:08:33.950
constant C if X is large and so this is
a slightly complicated and slightly

00:08:33.950 --> 00:08:33.960
a slightly complicated and slightly
 

00:08:33.960 --> 00:08:37.070
a slightly complicated and slightly

looking at primes of size X how big a
gap can I actively construct but this is

00:08:44.210 --> 00:08:44.220
gap can I actively construct but this is
 

00:08:44.220 --> 00:08:46.550
gap can I actively construct but this is
the current quantity it's some quantity

00:08:46.550 --> 00:08:46.560
the current quantity it's some quantity
 

00:08:46.560 --> 00:08:47.750
the current quantity it's some quantity
that gets bigger and bigger and bigger

00:08:47.750 --> 00:08:47.760
that gets bigger and bigger and bigger
 

00:08:47.760 --> 00:08:49.360
that gets bigger and bigger and bigger
as X gets bigger and bigger and bigger

00:08:49.360 --> 00:08:49.370
as X gets bigger and bigger and bigger
 

00:08:49.370 --> 00:08:51.860
as X gets bigger and bigger and bigger
and this is the current state of the arm

00:08:51.860 --> 00:08:51.870
and this is the current state of the arm
 

00:08:51.870 --> 00:08:54.550
and this is the current state of the arm
so if you want to try and beat our

00:08:54.550 --> 00:08:54.560
so if you want to try and beat our
 

00:08:54.560 --> 00:08:57.040
so if you want to try and beat our
