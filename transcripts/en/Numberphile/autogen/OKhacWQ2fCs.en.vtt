I've got a cute little mathematical fact

00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:02.250
I've got a cute little mathematical fact
 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:04.490
I've got a cute little mathematical fact
for you would you might like every

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:04.500
for you would you might like every
 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:07.400
for you would you might like every
positive integer can be written as the

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:07.410
positive integer can be written as the
 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:10.940
positive integer can be written as the
sum of three palindrome numbers and I've

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:10.950
sum of three palindrome numbers and I've
 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:12.650
sum of three palindrome numbers and I've
learned that cute little mathematical

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:12.660
learned that cute little mathematical
 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:14.720
learned that cute little mathematical
fact from this paper a palindrome number

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:14.730
fact from this paper a palindrome number
 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:16.369
fact from this paper a palindrome number
is something we have talked about before

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:16.379
is something we have talked about before
 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:18.230
is something we have talked about before
it's a number that's the same forwards

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:18.240
it's a number that's the same forwards
 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:21.019
it's a number that's the same forwards
and backwards as an example something

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:21.029
and backwards as an example something
 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:27.230
and backwards as an example something
like 120 1 or 937 thousand seven hundred

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240
like 120 1 or 937 thousand seven hundred
 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:29.540
like 120 1 or 937 thousand seven hundred
and thirty-nine would be a palindrome

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550
and thirty-nine would be a palindrome
 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:31.009
and thirty-nine would be a palindrome
number they go forwards and backwards

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019
number they go forwards and backwards
 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:33.680
number they go forwards and backwards
this paper states that any positive

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690
this paper states that any positive
 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:36.860
this paper states that any positive
integer can be written as the sum of

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870
integer can be written as the sum of
 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:39.889
integer can be written as the sum of
three palindrome numbers and just to

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899
three palindrome numbers and just to
 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:42.410
three palindrome numbers and just to
show you this doing example so I

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420
show you this doing example so I
 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.330
show you this doing example so I
actually set brady up for this we did an

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340
actually set brady up for this we did an
 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:46.069
actually set brady up for this we did an
example in advance I asked you for a

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079
example in advance I asked you for a
 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:48.410
example in advance I asked you for a
significant number I was hoping for your

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420
significant number I was hoping for your
 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.180
significant number I was hoping for your
bank details or something like that but

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190
bank details or something like that but
 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:53.930
bank details or something like that but
you gave me a date and actually look I

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940
you gave me a date and actually look I
 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:55.310
you gave me a date and actually look I
was quite surprised that you gave me

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320
was quite surprised that you gave me
 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.500
was quite surprised that you gave me
this date I like it I like it a lot you

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510
this date I like it I like it a lot you
 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:04.100
this date I like it I like it a lot you
gave me this date which was 3004 1777 I

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110
gave me this date which was 3004 1777 I
 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:05.990
gave me this date which was 3004 1777 I
had to ask you what that date was and

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000
had to ask you what that date was and
 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.300
had to ask you what that date was and
you Tommy it was Gail's birthday coughs

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310
you Tommy it was Gail's birthday coughs
 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:09.890

number forwards and backwards they are

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649
number forwards and backwards they are
 

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:51.950
number forwards and backwards they are
the same and if you add them up you get

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960
the same and if you add them up you get
 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:55.069
the same and if you add them up you get
our target number here at the top the

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079
our target number here at the top the
 

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:56.780
our target number here at the top the
thing is the reason I didn't do this

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790
thing is the reason I didn't do this
 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:59.959
thing is the reason I didn't do this
live is because in this paper it

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969
live is because in this paper it
 

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:03.139
live is because in this paper it
explains how to do it which involves 40

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149
explains how to do it which involves 40
 

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:07.399
explains how to do it which involves 40
pages of algorithms and special cases so

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409
pages of algorithms and special cases so
 

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:08.660
pages of algorithms and special cases so
if you want to learn how to do this

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670
if you want to learn how to do this
 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:11.360
if you want to learn how to do this
great go for it but you're going to have

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370
great go for it but you're going to have
 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:13.520
great go for it but you're going to have
to memorize 40 pay

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530
to memorize 40 pay
 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:16.520
to memorize 40 pay
of special algorithms so I didn't do

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:16.530
of special algorithms so I didn't do
 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:19.910
of special algorithms so I didn't do
that what I did do is I used a website

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:19.920
that what I did do is I used a website
 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:22.309
that what I did do is I used a website
that was made by a friend of mine so

00:02:22.309 --> 00:02:22.319
that was made by a friend of mine so
 

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:24.770

Christian Larson perfect made a website

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:24.780
Christian Larson perfect made a website
 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:26.390
Christian Larson perfect made a website
so that you can try this out for

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:26.400
so that you can try this out for
 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:28.790
so that you can try this out for
yourself and you can enter any number

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:28.800
yourself and you can enter any number
 

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:30.320
yourself and you can enter any number
you want and it's going to give you the

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:30.330
you want and it's going to give you the
 

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:32.720
you want and it's going to give you the
three palindrome numbers as described by

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:32.730
three palindrome numbers as described by
 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:36.770
three palindrome numbers as described by
the algorithms in this paper let's do an

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:36.780
the algorithms in this paper let's do an
 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:38.660
the algorithms in this paper let's do an
example here I'm going to enter the

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:38.670
example here I'm going to enter the
 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:44.030
example here I'm going to enter the
first few digits of pi 3 1 4 1 5 9 2 the

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:44.040
first few digits of pi 3 1 4 1 5 9 2 the
 

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:46.430
first few digits of pi 3 1 4 1 5 9 2 the
website will run these algorithms for us

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:46.440
website will run these algorithms for us
 

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:48.710
website will run these algorithms for us
so that I can write it out for us

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:48.720
so that I can write it out for us
 

00:02:48.720 --> 00:03:01.090
so that I can write it out for us
so we've got 2 2 0 0 0 2 2 + 9 2 6 6 - 9

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:01.100
so we've got 2 2 0 0 0 2 2 + 9 2 6 6 - 9
 

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:07.820
so we've got 2 2 0 0 0 2 2 + 9 2 6 6 - 9
+ and hit our third number 1 4 + 9 for

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:07.830
+ and hit our third number 1 4 + 9 for
 

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:10.070
+ and hit our third number 1 4 + 9 for
one palindrome numbers three of them and

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:10.080
one palindrome numbers three of them and
 

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:12.140
one palindrome numbers three of them and
if you add them up you get our target

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:12.150
if you add them up you get our target
 

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:14.120
if you add them up you get our target
number the paper guarantees that you can

always do this you can do this in any

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:16.380
always do this you can do this in any
 

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:19.819
always do this you can do this in any
base as well this is not just base 10 so

00:03:19.819 --> 00:03:19.829
base as well this is not just base 10 so
 

00:03:19.829 --> 00:03:21.229
base as well this is not just base 10 so
the paper actually proved it for any

00:03:21.229 --> 00:03:21.239
the paper actually proved it for any
 

00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:23.449
the paper actually proved it for any
base in fact the paper proved it for any

base in fact the paper proved it for any
 

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:26.930
base in fact the paper proved it for any
base greater than 5 and the small base

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:26.940
base greater than 5 and the small base
 

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:29.930
base greater than 5 and the small base
is 2 3 &amp; 4 that was done by someone else

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:29.940
is 2 3 &amp; 4 that was done by someone else
 

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:31.729
is 2 3 &amp; 4 that was done by someone else
in a different paper but it's kind of

00:03:31.729 --> 00:03:31.739
in a different paper but it's kind of
 

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:33.199
in a different paper but it's kind of
unsatisfying when I'm saying these

00:03:33.199 --> 00:03:33.209
unsatisfying when I'm saying these
 

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:35.449
unsatisfying when I'm saying these
algorithms exist and I'm not even

00:03:35.449 --> 00:03:35.459
algorithms exist and I'm not even
 

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:37.490
algorithms exist and I'm not even
showing you them so I thought I would

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:37.500
showing you them so I thought I would
 

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:39.530
showing you them so I thought I would
show you one of them I'll do an example

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:39.540
show you one of them I'll do an example
 

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:41.900
show you one of them I'll do an example
with the algorithm as explained in the

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:41.910
with the algorithm as explained in the
 

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:44.569
with the algorithm as explained in the
paper just do the example I've just done

00:03:44.569 --> 00:03:44.579
paper just do the example I've just done
 

00:03:44.579 --> 00:03:47.319
paper just do the example I've just done
here with the first few digits of pi and

00:03:47.319 --> 00:03:47.329
here with the first few digits of pi and
 

00:03:47.329 --> 00:03:49.789
here with the first few digits of pi and
we'll see how it works out according to

00:03:49.789 --> 00:03:49.799
we'll see how it works out according to
 

00:03:49.799 --> 00:03:52.220
we'll see how it works out according to
the paper ok that's our target so that's

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:52.230
the paper ok that's our target so that's
 

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:54.620

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:08.720
number is categorized into a type so
you're gonna have to find out what type

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:08.730
you're gonna have to find out what type
 

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:10.789
you're gonna have to find out what type
of number this is so you go through the

00:04:10.789 --> 00:04:10.799
of number this is so you go through the
 

00:04:10.799 --> 00:04:13.130
of number this is so you go through the
paper you look it up and if you do that

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:13.140
paper you look it up and if you do that
 

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:16.729
paper you look it up and if you do that
it's called a type III number so this is

00:04:16.729 --> 00:04:16.739
it's called a type III number so this is
 

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:20.060
it's called a type III number so this is
Type A 3 and that means you have a 1 in

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:20.070
Type A 3 and that means you have a 1 in
 

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:23.240
Type A 3 and that means you have a 1 in
the second place it means the two ends

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:23.250
the second place it means the two ends
 

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:25.790
the second place it means the two ends
are different and it means the first

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:25.800
are different and it means the first
 

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:27.650
are different and it means the first
digit is greater than 2

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:27.660
digit is greater than 2
 

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:30.380
digit is greater than 2
so with those conditions that's called a

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:30.390
so with those conditions that's called a
 

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:32.900
so with those conditions that's called a
type III number and then if you look at

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:32.910
type III number and then if you look at
 

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:34.940
type III number and then if you look at
the paper it tells you how to start off

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:34.950
the paper it tells you how to start off
 

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:36.530
the paper it tells you how to start off
the three palindrome numbers and it

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:36.540
the three palindrome numbers and it
 

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:39.380
the three palindrome numbers and it
tells you that the first number is going

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:39.390
tells you that the first number is going
 

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:41.000
tells you that the first number is going
to start with a two it's gonna be one

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:41.010
to start with a two it's gonna be one
 

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:43.250
to start with a two it's gonna be one
less the first digit will be one less

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:43.260
less the first digit will be one less
 

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:45.860
less the first digit will be one less
than the first digit of your target your

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:45.870
than the first digit of your target your
 

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:48.320
than the first digit of your target your
second palindrome number is going to

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:48.330
second palindrome number is going to
 

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:50.690
second palindrome number is going to
start with a nine here in the second

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:50.700
start with a nine here in the second
 

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:52.190
start with a nine here in the second
column and that's always going to be

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:52.200
column and that's always going to be
 

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:55.100
column and that's always going to be
true with in this type of number a three

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:55.110
true with in this type of number a three
 

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:57.560
true with in this type of number a three
and the third palindrome number it's

00:04:57.560 --> 00:04:57.570
and the third palindrome number it's
 

00:04:57.570 --> 00:05:00.290
and the third palindrome number it's
going to start with a one and now this

00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:00.300
going to start with a one and now this
 

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:02.540
going to start with a one and now this
come from the difference between the two

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:02.550
come from the difference between the two
 

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:04.520
come from the difference between the two
ends of the target number so we're

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:04.530
ends of the target number so we're
 

00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:06.140
ends of the target number so we're
starting with a 1 now you have to use

00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:06.150
starting with a 1 now you have to use
 

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:08.450
starting with a 1 now you have to use
the paper and look up which algorithm to

00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:08.460
the paper and look up which algorithm to
 

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:09.770
the paper and look up which algorithm to
use because there's whole bunch of

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:09.780
use because there's whole bunch of
 

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:11.330
use because there's whole bunch of
algorithms to use this actually

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:11.340
algorithms to use this actually
 

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:13.970
algorithms to use this actually
algorithm 1 so there to use algorithm 1

00:05:13.970 --> 00:05:13.980
algorithm 1 so there to use algorithm 1
 

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:16.070
algorithm 1 so there to use algorithm 1
to complete these palindrome numbers for

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:16.080
to complete these palindrome numbers for
 

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:18.350
to complete these palindrome numbers for
free you automatically get the last

00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:18.360
free you automatically get the last
 

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:20.690
free you automatically get the last
digits because they're pound roams so if

00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:20.700
digits because they're pound roams so if
 

00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:22.970
digits because they're pound roams so if
it starts with a 2 it ends with a 2 here

00:05:22.970 --> 00:05:22.980
it starts with a 2 it ends with a 2 here
 

00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:25.460
it starts with a 2 it ends with a 2 here
if it starts with a 9 ends with a 9

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:25.470
if it starts with a 9 ends with a 9
 

00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:28.610
if it starts with a 9 ends with a 9
starts with a 1 here ends with a 1 here

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:28.620
starts with a 1 here ends with a 1 here
 

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:31.220
starts with a 1 here ends with a 1 here
and does this add up it looks like it

00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:31.230
and does this add up it looks like it
 

00:05:31.230 --> 00:05:35.690
and does this add up it looks like it
does I've got 1 plus 9 plus 2 would give

00:05:35.690 --> 00:05:35.700
does I've got 1 plus 9 plus 2 would give
 

00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:37.880
does I've got 1 plus 9 plus 2 would give
me a 2 here and a carry or what actually

00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:37.890
me a 2 here and a carry or what actually
 

00:05:37.890 --> 00:05:39.980
me a 2 here and a carry or what actually
I might write that down I'll put a carry

00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:39.990
I might write that down I'll put a carry
 

00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:42.170
I might write that down I'll put a carry
of 1 I'll have a career Oh also if you

00:05:42.170 --> 00:05:42.180
of 1 I'll have a career Oh also if you
 

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:43.820
of 1 I'll have a career Oh also if you
use this algorithm tells you to put in

00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:43.830
use this algorithm tells you to put in
 

00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:46.040
use this algorithm tells you to put in
the first number right in the middle

00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:46.050
the first number right in the middle
 

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:49.120
the first number right in the middle
which if I again get the middle of this

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:49.130
which if I again get the middle of this
 

00:05:49.130 --> 00:05:52.370
which if I again get the middle of this
so it must be there it puts you tells

00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:52.380
so it must be there it puts you tells
 

00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:55.270
so it must be there it puts you tells
you to put a 0 right there in the middle

00:05:55.270 --> 00:05:55.280
you to put a 0 right there in the middle
 

00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:57.860
you to put a 0 right there in the middle
it's a bit like a Sudoku yeah if you

00:05:57.860 --> 00:05:57.870
it's a bit like a Sudoku yeah if you
 

00:05:57.870 --> 00:05:59.480
it's a bit like a Sudoku yeah if you
look up the algorithms in the paper the

00:05:59.480 --> 00:05:59.490
look up the algorithms in the paper the
 

00:05:59.490 --> 00:06:01.280
look up the algorithms in the paper the
reading mind-bending all right what's

00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:01.290
reading mind-bending all right what's
 

00:06:01.290 --> 00:06:02.630
reading mind-bending all right what's
going on now they're doing this they're

00:06:02.630 --> 00:06:02.640
going on now they're doing this they're
 

00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:03.770
going on now they're doing this they're
doing that because they're explaining

00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:03.780
doing that because they're explaining
 

00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:06.530
doing that because they're explaining
every step in really a particular

00:06:06.530 --> 00:06:06.540
every step in really a particular
 

00:06:06.540 --> 00:06:08.630
every step in really a particular
mathematical language especially because

00:06:08.630 --> 00:06:08.640
mathematical language especially because
 

00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:10.460
mathematical language especially because
they're trying to do it so that you can

00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:10.470
they're trying to do it so that you can
 

00:06:10.470 --> 00:06:13.190
they're trying to do it so that you can
do it for any base as well but this what

00:06:13.190 --> 00:06:13.200
do it for any base as well but this what
 

00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:15.260
do it for any base as well but this what
I'm doing it's kind of like a Sudoku

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:15.270
I'm doing it's kind of like a Sudoku
 

00:06:15.270 --> 00:06:17.060
I'm doing it's kind of like a Sudoku
that's kind of the gist of it so we've

00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:17.070
that's kind of the gist of it so we've
 

00:06:17.070 --> 00:06:18.830
that's kind of the gist of it so we've
got our gap to fill in the second column

00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:18.840
got our gap to fill in the second column
 

00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:21.710
got our gap to fill in the second column
I want a 1 up there let's just fill it

00:06:21.710 --> 00:06:21.720
I want a 1 up there let's just fill it
 

00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:23.900
I want a 1 up there let's just fill it
with a 2 then I would have 9 plus 2

00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:23.910
with a 2 then I would have 9 plus 2
 

00:06:23.910 --> 00:06:26.720
with a 2 then I would have 9 plus 2
would give me 11 but be a 1 there there

00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:26.730
would give me 11 but be a 1 there there
 

00:06:26.730 --> 00:06:28.520
would give me 11 but be a 1 there there
would be a carrier 1 and that's good

00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:28.530
would be a carrier 1 and that's good
 

00:06:28.530 --> 00:06:30.770
would be a carrier 1 and that's good
news because that means that column that

00:06:30.770 --> 00:06:30.780
news because that means that column that
 

00:06:30.780 --> 00:06:33.050
news because that means that column that
first column adds up nicely and for that

00:06:33.050 --> 00:06:33.060
first column adds up nicely and for that
 

00:06:33.060 --> 00:06:34.910
first column adds up nicely and for that
second column we don't want to carry

00:06:34.910 --> 00:06:34.920
second column we don't want to carry
 

00:06:34.920 --> 00:06:36.560
second column we don't want to carry
because then it won't work let's put a 0

00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:36.570
because then it won't work let's put a 0
 

00:06:36.570 --> 00:06:38.600
because then it won't work let's put a 0
here for the carry is there anything

00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:38.610
here for the carry is there anything
 

00:06:38.610 --> 00:06:40.860
here for the carry is there anything
else we can discover well automatically

00:06:40.860 --> 00:06:40.870
else we can discover well automatically
 

00:06:40.870 --> 00:06:43.590
else we can discover well automatically
you have a - over there which puts a -

00:06:43.590 --> 00:06:43.600
you have a - over there which puts a -
 

00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:45.900
you have a - over there which puts a -
over there as well

00:06:45.900 --> 00:06:45.910
over there as well
 

00:06:45.910 --> 00:06:48.690
over there as well
now at this point I think it gets a

00:06:48.690 --> 00:06:48.700
now at this point I think it gets a
 

00:06:48.700 --> 00:06:50.760
now at this point I think it gets a
little bit difficult I think for this

00:06:50.760 --> 00:06:50.770
little bit difficult I think for this
 

00:06:50.770 --> 00:06:53.130
little bit difficult I think for this
digit here the second digit of the

00:06:53.130 --> 00:06:53.140
digit here the second digit of the
 

00:06:53.140 --> 00:06:54.930
digit here the second digit of the
second pound Rome I think we're going to

00:06:54.930 --> 00:06:54.940
second pound Rome I think we're going to
 

00:06:54.940 --> 00:06:57.240
second pound Rome I think we're going to
have a choice for this now the algorithm

00:06:57.240 --> 00:06:57.250
have a choice for this now the algorithm
 

00:06:57.250 --> 00:06:59.310
have a choice for this now the algorithm
tells you what to put in so I'll just

00:06:59.310 --> 00:06:59.320
tells you what to put in so I'll just
 

00:06:59.320 --> 00:07:00.720
tells you what to put in so I'll just
follow the algorithm I think you could

00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:00.730
follow the algorithm I think you could
 

00:07:00.730 --> 00:07:02.970
follow the algorithm I think you could
perhaps have a choice but the algorithm

00:07:02.970 --> 00:07:02.980
perhaps have a choice but the algorithm
 

00:07:02.980 --> 00:07:05.730
perhaps have a choice but the algorithm
tells you to put a 2 in that position if

00:07:05.730 --> 00:07:05.740
tells you to put a 2 in that position if
 

00:07:05.740 --> 00:07:07.650
tells you to put a 2 in that position if
you get a 2 over there you automatically

00:07:07.650 --> 00:07:07.660
you get a 2 over there you automatically
 

00:07:07.660 --> 00:07:11.160
you get a 2 over there you automatically
get a 2 over here so maybe we can

00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:11.170
get a 2 over here so maybe we can
 

00:07:11.170 --> 00:07:13.970
get a 2 over here so maybe we can
complete this column now with one a9

00:07:13.970 --> 00:07:13.980
complete this column now with one a9
 

00:07:13.980 --> 00:07:17.550
complete this column now with one a9
I've got a caviar one I've got a 2 and a

00:07:17.550 --> 00:07:17.560
I've got a caviar one I've got a 2 and a
 

00:07:17.560 --> 00:07:21.630
I've got a caviar one I've got a 2 and a
2 so I must need a 4 here and the next

00:07:21.630 --> 00:07:21.640
2 so I must need a 4 here and the next
 

00:07:21.640 --> 00:07:23.850
2 so I must need a 4 here and the next
carrier would be a zero down here I

00:07:23.850 --> 00:07:23.860
carrier would be a zero down here I
 

00:07:23.860 --> 00:07:27.530
carrier would be a zero down here I
believe automatically you get the four

00:07:27.530 --> 00:07:27.540
believe automatically you get the four
 

00:07:27.540 --> 00:07:30.750
believe automatically you get the four
over there for this column let's see I

00:07:30.750 --> 00:07:30.760
over there for this column let's see I
 

00:07:30.760 --> 00:07:34.440
over there for this column let's see I
wanna four I've got most of it depends

00:07:34.440 --> 00:07:34.450
wanna four I've got most of it depends
 

00:07:34.450 --> 00:07:36.630
wanna four I've got most of it depends
what the carry number is down here I'm

00:07:36.630 --> 00:07:36.640
what the carry number is down here I'm
 

00:07:36.640 --> 00:07:38.460
what the carry number is down here I'm
going to assume and this is what the

00:07:38.460 --> 00:07:38.470
going to assume and this is what the
 

00:07:38.470 --> 00:07:40.500
going to assume and this is what the
paper tells you to do it tells you to

00:07:40.500 --> 00:07:40.510
paper tells you to do it tells you to
 

00:07:40.510 --> 00:07:43.020
paper tells you to do it tells you to
assume it's a 1 and if it's if it's not

00:07:43.020 --> 00:07:43.030
assume it's a 1 and if it's if it's not
 

00:07:43.030 --> 00:07:44.580
assume it's a 1 and if it's if it's not
a 1 you're going to fix it later

00:07:44.580 --> 00:07:44.590
a 1 you're going to fix it later
 

00:07:44.590 --> 00:07:47.490
a 1 you're going to fix it later
that means if I add that column up I'll

00:07:47.490 --> 00:07:47.500
that means if I add that column up I'll
 

00:07:47.500 --> 00:07:49.410
that means if I add that column up I'll
need a 0 in that position

00:07:49.410 --> 00:07:49.420
need a 0 in that position
 

00:07:49.420 --> 00:07:52.170
need a 0 in that position
so that adds up to 4 and automatically

00:07:52.170 --> 00:07:52.180
so that adds up to 4 and automatically
 

00:07:52.180 --> 00:07:54.660
so that adds up to 4 and automatically
you get a 0 in that position we've

00:07:54.660 --> 00:07:54.670
you get a 0 in that position we've
 

00:07:54.670 --> 00:07:56.550
you get a 0 in that position we've
completed the first palindrome now

00:07:56.550 --> 00:07:56.560
completed the first palindrome now
 

00:07:56.560 --> 00:07:58.650
completed the first palindrome now
what's missing well we've got this

00:07:58.650 --> 00:07:58.660
what's missing well we've got this
 

00:07:58.660 --> 00:08:01.230
what's missing well we've got this
missing digit here the paper does tell

00:08:01.230 --> 00:08:01.240
missing digit here the paper does tell
 

00:08:01.240 --> 00:08:04.170
missing digit here the paper does tell
you to put in a carry of 1 if you don't

00:08:04.170 --> 00:08:04.180
you to put in a carry of 1 if you don't
 

00:08:04.180 --> 00:08:07.410
you to put in a carry of 1 if you don't
know so we say that's a carry of 1 we

00:08:07.410 --> 00:08:07.420
know so we say that's a carry of 1 we
 

00:08:07.420 --> 00:08:11.660
know so we say that's a carry of 1 we
want this to add up well we've got 5 1 1

00:08:11.660 --> 00:08:11.670
want this to add up well we've got 5 1 1
 

00:08:11.670 --> 00:08:15.360
want this to add up well we've got 5 1 1
so we're going to have to put in a 6

00:08:15.360 --> 00:08:15.370
so we're going to have to put in a 6
 

00:08:15.370 --> 00:08:18.810
so we're going to have to put in a 6
there and then automatically a 6 there

00:08:18.810 --> 00:08:18.820
there and then automatically a 6 there
 

00:08:18.820 --> 00:08:21.030
there and then automatically a 6 there
and that completes the second palindrome

00:08:21.030 --> 00:08:21.040
and that completes the second palindrome
 

00:08:21.040 --> 00:08:23.220
and that completes the second palindrome
number and now we just want got one last

00:08:23.220 --> 00:08:23.230
number and now we just want got one last
 

00:08:23.230 --> 00:08:25.380
number and now we just want got one last
digit to fill in so we want to fill in

00:08:25.380 --> 00:08:25.390
digit to fill in so we want to fill in
 

00:08:25.390 --> 00:08:28.740
digit to fill in so we want to fill in
this last column so we need a 5 I've got

00:08:28.740 --> 00:08:28.750
this last column so we need a 5 I've got
 

00:08:28.750 --> 00:08:32.820
this last column so we need a 5 I've got
a 6 I've got a cow a of 0 so that must

00:08:32.820 --> 00:08:32.830
a 6 I've got a cow a of 0 so that must
 

00:08:32.830 --> 00:08:35.190
a 6 I've got a cow a of 0 so that must
be a 9 right there that fills in the

00:08:35.190 --> 00:08:35.200
be a 9 right there that fills in the
 

00:08:35.200 --> 00:08:37.020
be a 9 right there that fills in the
last palindrome number and you should

00:08:37.020 --> 00:08:37.030
last palindrome number and you should
 

00:08:37.030 --> 00:08:39.420
last palindrome number and you should
double-check that it works out but in

00:08:39.420 --> 00:08:39.430
double-check that it works out but in
 

00:08:39.430 --> 00:08:41.640
double-check that it works out but in
this case we've been lucky it does work

00:08:41.640 --> 00:08:41.650
this case we've been lucky it does work
 

00:08:41.650 --> 00:08:43.680
this case we've been lucky it does work
out if you add up these numbers you get

00:08:43.680 --> 00:08:43.690
out if you add up these numbers you get
 

00:08:43.690 --> 00:08:46.500
out if you add up these numbers you get
our target number these were a couple of

00:08:46.500 --> 00:08:46.510
our target number these were a couple of
 

00:08:46.510 --> 00:08:48.000
our target number these were a couple of
assumptions that we made if they were

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:48.010
assumptions that we made if they were
 

00:08:48.010 --> 00:08:51.330
assumptions that we made if they were
wrong we can fix it at this step and the

00:08:51.330 --> 00:08:51.340
wrong we can fix it at this step and the
 

00:08:51.340 --> 00:08:53.310
wrong we can fix it at this step and the
paper does tell you how to fix the

00:08:53.310 --> 00:08:53.320
paper does tell you how to fix the
 

00:08:53.320 --> 00:08:54.510
paper does tell you how to fix the
number if you need to make an

00:08:54.510 --> 00:08:54.520

that completes it and that is an example

00:08:59.130 --> 00:08:59.140

this episode people who wrote the paper
said that this was a kind of a

said that this was a kind of a
 

00:10:16.930 --> 00:10:20.910
said that this was a kind of a
mathematical folklore thing so it was

mathematical folklore thing so it was
 

00:10:20.920 --> 00:10:22.410
