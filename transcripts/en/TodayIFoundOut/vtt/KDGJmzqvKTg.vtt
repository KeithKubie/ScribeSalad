00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:16.680
There are many similarities and differences
between our little wing-whipping friends.

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:19.080
For starters, all can sting you.

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:23.930
That said, you may derive some solace in the
fact that when certain of them sting humans,

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:27.730
they die- not so when they sting many other
animals.

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:32.520
The barbed stingers on honey bees particularly
end up getting lodged in our soft flesh, ripping

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:36.000
out their backsides when they try and get
away after stinging you.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.790
When they sting most animals, this doesn’t
happen.

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:41.000
Further, all three live in hives or combs.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:46.110
These humble abodes are always in cooler and
sheltered areas, often within the shade of

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:47.110
trees.

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:51.550
Bees, wasps, and hornets all proliferate in
warm weather, their hives growing in the spring

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:52.620
and early summer.

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:57.230
By late summer, food becomes scarce and that’s
when they, especially wasps and hornets, start

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:00.420
finding their way to human food and your picnic.

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:05.509
While the colors are all pretty similar (brown/black,
yellow, with some white) on bees, wasps, and

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:07.810
hornets, the markings differ.

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:12.640
This is where the insects we all tend to lump
in the same category (flying, stinging, and

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:15.060
scary), begin to show their differences.

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:16.610
We start with the humble bee.

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:21.250
Bees are furry pollen collectors, who rarely
have any need to interact with humans.

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:25.940
As the expression “as busy as a bee” insinuates,
worker bees (usually the only type of bee

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:31.170
most people will see) spend their lives going
to and from the hive, acquiring nectar (and

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:33.000
pollen on their bodies) during their trips.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.280
They play an integral part in the pollination
of various plants, and some of them provide

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:38.680
us with tasty honey.

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:42.979
bumblee2They feed the acquired nectar to their
young, developing the new generation of bees.

00:01:42.979 --> 00:01:46.300
They also protect the queen bee, allowing
her to lay the eggs.

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:51.000
There are over 25,000 known bee species, but
the two most common types of bees are honeybees

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.280
and bumblebees.

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:57.710
Both produce wax, but only the honeybee produces
honey.

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:01.340
Another big difference between the two is
that the bumblebee is nearly double the size

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:02.549
of the honeybee.

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:07.400
Bumblebees are fat (at least in bee terms)
and hairy, their size relative to their wingspan

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:11.230
giving rise to the myth that science can’t
explain how they are able to fly.

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:12.230
Honeybees are more sleek.

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:17.490
They both are yellow with black stripes, though
the bumblebee often has a red/orange or white

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:18.490
tale.

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:22.719
Additionally, honeybees live in large colonies,
topping out at 25,000 bees.

00:02:22.719 --> 00:02:27.010
Bumblebees tend build their nests underground
(though they have been found in walls), and

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:29.709
sometimes in tunnels constructed by other
animals.

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:33.060
Their colonies are much smaller than bumblebees,
only numbering into the hundreds.

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:36.450
waspWasps, unlike bees, are aggressive and
predators.

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:40.849
There are over 30,000 species of wasps and
they are distinguishable from bees by their

00:02:40.849 --> 00:02:43.329
pointed lower abdomens and narrow “waist,”
a petiole, that separates the abdomen from

00:02:43.329 --> 00:02:44.329
the thorax.

00:02:44.329 --> 00:02:47.079
They also have little to no hair on their
bodies (as opposed to bees) and don’t play

00:02:47.079 --> 00:02:49.260
much of a role in the pollination of plants.

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:52.379
Their legs are shiny, slender, and shaped
like cylinders.

00:02:52.379 --> 00:02:55.719
All wasps hunt for their food and build nests
for shelter.

00:02:55.719 --> 00:02:59.920
What exactly they prey on and how they build
their nests depends on the type of wasp.

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:03.499
There are two general types of wasps: social
and solitary.

00:03:03.499 --> 00:03:07.279
Social wasps build colonies and start from
scratch every spring, never nesting in the

00:03:07.279 --> 00:03:08.450
same spot twice.

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:12.260
They design their home sweet home out of chewed
up wood fibers and their own saliva.

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:16.939
The nests may hold up to five thousands wasps
and are typically found in protected spaces,

00:03:16.939 --> 00:03:19.999
like attics, inside of walls, or under decks.

00:03:19.999 --> 00:03:24.299
Social wasps eat many different types of things
(they are omnivorous) including fruits, plants,

00:03:24.299 --> 00:03:26.540
human food, and other insects (flies, bee
larva, caterpillars, etc.)

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:31.230
Solitary wasps do not form colonies and live
under ground or in tubular mud nests.

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:34.819
There’s no caste system, as in the queen
cares for it’s own young.

00:03:34.819 --> 00:03:39.111
The queen seeks out prey – flies, bee larva,
cicadas (there’s actually a species of wasp

00:03:39.111 --> 00:03:42.769
known as “cicada killers”), and paralyzes
it with its sting.

00:03:42.769 --> 00:03:46.379
They take the still-living insect back to
the nest and feed it to their larva.

00:03:46.379 --> 00:03:49.239
It’s during the late summer when wasps begin
to get aggressive.

00:03:49.239 --> 00:03:53.639
This is due to the fact that the worker wasps
job is done for the year and they’re, literally,

00:03:53.639 --> 00:03:54.639
waiting to die.

00:03:54.639 --> 00:03:58.689
After taking care of the queen and feeding
the new generation of worker wasps, the old

00:03:58.689 --> 00:04:00.260
ones are now useless.

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:04.159
They become disoriented and begin to venture
away from the nest, in search of food and

00:04:04.159 --> 00:04:05.159
something sweet.

00:04:05.159 --> 00:04:09.480
As absurd as this sounds, these wasps have
nothing left to live for besides satisfying

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:10.480
their sweet tooth.

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:13.230
So, they become aggressive, bold, and persistent.

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:15.589
They land on a human hand that’s holding
an ice cream cone.

00:04:15.589 --> 00:04:17.609
They dive into a can of soda.

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:19.260
They munch on a half-eaten apple.

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:23.840
In fact, in September of 2013, the British
Red Cross warned citizens that wasps were

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:27.330
getting “drunk” on fermented fruit and
were going all out in search of more.

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:30.780
Said Joe Mulligan of the Red Cross to the
British newspaper, The Independent, in 2013:

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:35.500
It’s hilarious that, now worker wasps have
finished their life’s work, all they are

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:38.850
doing now is feasting on fermented fruit and
getting ‘drunk’.

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:43.760
All that being said, wasps aren’t just pests,
but benefit humanity in some ways.

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:48.030
They prey on many other “pest” insects
and have actually been used by the agricultural

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:52.670
industry as an effective means to control
crop pests, resulting in a much more environmentally

00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:54.790
friendly way to do this over many pesticides.

00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:58.570
giant-hornetHornets are actually a species
of wasps.

00:04:58.570 --> 00:05:01.670
Hornets differ from other wasps in that their
stings are more venomous (they contain more

00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:05.170
acetylcholine); they tend to attack for food
as a colony, and their nests are all aerial

00:05:05.170 --> 00:05:07.260
(as opposed to many wasps species).

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:10.890
The Giant Asian Hornet, native to parts of
Russia, China, Vietnam, and the mountains

00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:15.720
of Japan, can grow to be about 2 inches long
with about a 4-5 inch wingspan.

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:18.130
It is the world’s largest and most venomous
wasp.

00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:22.400
It is colloquially known as the yak-killer,
due to the venom’s ability to dissolve the

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:25.150
tissue of even the largest of mammals.

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:29.440
Because the honey bee is on an individual
level incapable of harming the Giant Asian

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:33.810
Hornet and just a handful of Giant Asian Hornets
are capable of decimating an entire hive of

00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:38.060
honeybees, the Japanese Honeybee has come
up with an alternate strategy to stopping

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:40.720
the mass-destruction of their populace by
the hornets.

00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:45.140
When the Giant Asian Hornet is detected, first
the honey bee will emit a pheromone that the

00:05:45.140 --> 00:05:48.130
Hornet can pick up on that’s basically an
“I see you” warning.

00:05:48.130 --> 00:05:50.440
The scouting hornet then may leave in this
case.

00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:53.280
ball-hornetIf not, and the hornet continues
towards the hive, the honey bees will ball

00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:57.050
the hornet– essentially surrounding it completely
with as many bees as possible.

00:05:57.050 --> 00:06:01.240
They will then exert themselves as much as
possible to raise their body temperatures.

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:05.190
Inside the ball, the temperature will rise
rapidly, while simultaneously the carbon dioxide

00:06:05.190 --> 00:06:06.700
levels will also increase.

00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:11.590
Once the temperature inside the ball passes
115 degrees Fahrenheit or 46 degrees Celsius,

00:06:11.590 --> 00:06:15.580
it exceeds what the hornet can tolerate, but
is still well under what the honey bees can

00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:16.580
handle (around 50 degrees Celsius).

00:06:16.580 --> 00:06:20.820
The combination of heat and low oxygen level
will eventually kill the Giant Asian Hornet.

00:06:20.820 --> 00:06:24.750
Several of the honey bees will likely die
before the hornet and this means of defense

00:06:24.750 --> 00:06:30.100
isn’t effective against a large number of
Giant Asian Hornets, but it works well at

00:06:30.100 --> 00:06:35.460
eliminating the scouting Giant Asian Hornets,
which can potentially stop a large scale attack

00:06:35.460 --> 00:06:55.960
from happening in the first place.
