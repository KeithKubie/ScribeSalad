1
00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.580
Right?
When I say pull the trigger,
obviously I need mean punch someone.

2
00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:07.430
I don't mean she said Chicago oil either anywhere.
It's like,

3
00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:10.620
especially after that Nipsey Hussle guy got killed.
That's crazy.

4
00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:15.300
That's so sad on video too.
They have the a fucked up past.

5
00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:19.380
I'm at a hip hop fan at all,
but apparently it was very positive,

6
00:00:19.381 --> 00:00:20.580
like anti violence.

7
00:00:20.581 --> 00:00:25.020
Like it wasn't like a thuggie rapper that was promoting,
you know,

8
00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:27.240
drug dealing and,
and gang violence,

9
00:00:27.241 --> 00:00:31.260
which I don't really know if even people do that as much anymore.
I don't know.

10
00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:35.790
But by all accounts,
this guy was loved and uh,
you know,
he just,

11
00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:41.920
it's just beyond fucked
just like that,

12
00:00:41.921 --> 00:00:46.230
that,
that is still going on in this world.
It was,
if I'm not mistaken,

13
00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:50.040
um,
he got into a fight with a guy,
right?

14
00:00:50.041 --> 00:00:53.550
And the guy came back with a gun,
don't know,
and shot him.
That's what I read.

15
00:00:53.551 --> 00:00:56.250
I think it was like a,
I don't know if it was like those lines,

16
00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:58.440
something along those lines.
Because the,
this,

17
00:00:58.441 --> 00:01:00.600
when you hear about a hip hop artists come down and you're like,
oh,

18
00:01:00.601 --> 00:01:04.530
there's this longstanding beef and you know,
you know,
who knows.

19
00:01:04.531 --> 00:01:08.160
But I think it was literally a fight that these guys got it and the guy came

20
00:01:08.161 --> 00:01:11.570
back with a gun and just fucking started unloading,
which is spirit'll.

21
00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.620
That's literally how my father died,
literally while,

22
00:01:13.621 --> 00:01:17.240
except that it was with a knife,
which is a much more hardcore with the devil.

23
00:01:17.241 --> 00:01:19.890
But my dad always outside of a strip club at four o'clock in the morning,

24
00:01:19.891 --> 00:01:23.690
God did an argument with a kid,
you know,
um,

25
00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:27.420
like a 16 year old kid and they got into a fist fight.
You know,

26
00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:30.450
the kid came back like an hour later with a kitchen knife and stabbed him.

27
00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:32.663
That's sad.

28
00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:38.850
And it's like God d it also takes a different type of person to,

29
00:01:38.851 --> 00:01:41.130
you know,
to kill.
I'm,
I'm a,

30
00:01:41.131 --> 00:01:44.100
I'm out the kid in the hood who's just ready to pull the trigger and punch

31
00:01:44.101 --> 00:01:45.090
somebody.
Like I'm not,

32
00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:47.460
I grew up in a weird way where it's like I was taught like Whoa,

33
00:01:47.461 --> 00:01:51.530
you wait until they throw the first punch,
which is a terrible strategy,
but the,

34
00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:53.340
that's sort of the way that I always,

35
00:01:53.341 --> 00:01:55.980
it was always like fist fights in the parking lot with your friends.

36
00:01:55.981 --> 00:01:57.210
You want to try and really hurt each other.

37
00:01:57.480 --> 00:02:00.480
It was you got into an argument over a video game and you went out back in the

38
00:02:00.481 --> 00:02:04.230
parking lot and you beat each other up for two minutes and then that was that.

39
00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:08.700
But guys that are,
you know,
willing to kill somebody over whatever,

40
00:02:08.701 --> 00:02:12.360
just an argument to take their life completely without any,

41
00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:17.040
just either they lose sense of the repercussions of it as well,

42
00:02:17.041 --> 00:02:18.120
which is sort of like,

43
00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:20.950
that's something that I think would separate most people and go like,
all right,

44
00:02:20.951 --> 00:02:22.830
why don't want to go to jail?
There's cameras.

45
00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:26.630
I think a giant chunk of it is how they're like,

46
00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:30.630
what experiences they have growing up.
Like what happens to them?

47
00:02:30.631 --> 00:02:34.080
Are they abused or they beaten?
Are they around a lot of violence?

48
00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:35.970
What are the expose to,

49
00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:40.590
and then how much more likely are you to commit that via to push that onto the

50
00:02:40.591 --> 00:02:44.220
next person?
That's really what it is.
I mean,
that's the vast majority of me.

51
00:02:44.221 --> 00:02:45.120
It's not a,

52
00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:49.230
it's a shocker that so much violent crime comes from poor neighborhoods.

53
00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:53.400
It's like,
it makes itself and makes itself,
of course,
almost like a virus.

54
00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:58.260
I agree.
And I,
you know,
I grew up,
my mom was extremely abusive,

55
00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:02.020
um,
you know,
and I grew up with around a ton of violence,

56
00:03:02.021 --> 00:03:04.930
a ton of physical and emotional abuse,
verbal abuse,

57
00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:08.020
always the threat of violence at the drop of a hat.
It was,

58
00:03:08.021 --> 00:03:09.700
it was always immediately too.

59
00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:12.070
I'll beat the shit out of you if you don't do what I say,

60
00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:17.780
even if she wasn't being violent.
Um,
and I did,
I go the opposite dude.
I,

61
00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:20.890
you know,
with my son,
dude,
I literally,
my son,
I've never even spanked him.

62
00:03:20.891 --> 00:03:23.200
I'd never smacked him on the hand.
I've never,

63
00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:26.050
I've never even really yelled at my son.
Um,

64
00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:29.640
and I don't think that I got lucky and have a good kid.
I do have a good grab,

65
00:03:29.641 --> 00:03:32.340
a great kid,
but I think it's a direct route,
you know,

66
00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:36.580
correlation to me not being aggressive with him at all.

67
00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:41.620
And I talk talking's huge,
right?
And have little conversations with them,

68
00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:46.240
not just tell them what to do.
[inaudible]
you have to give them the why.

69
00:03:46.241 --> 00:03:49.840
If they don't understand why,
you know that just in general in life,

70
00:03:49.841 --> 00:03:51.910
people just in general,
if they understand why something that you,

71
00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:55.540
there's a real purpose there and then they do what they're doing,
you know,

72
00:03:55.541 --> 00:03:59.350
with that purpose in mind.
And I think when little kids there,
you know,

73
00:03:59.351 --> 00:04:03.430
there's still malleable and sometimes it's annoying for them to ask why two or

74
00:04:03.431 --> 00:04:06.610
three times and it's easy to lose your patients.
Um,

75
00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:09.670
but once you realize what you're,
you know,
that's,
you know,
I'm a piece of shit.

76
00:04:09.671 --> 00:04:12.070
I'll admit I'm the first one to admit it,
but the only good thing I do,

77
00:04:12.071 --> 00:04:14.890
I think is the fact that I'm creating this good little person.

78
00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:18.670
He's a really good,
sweet person that I think is going to be,
you know,

79
00:04:18.671 --> 00:04:21.220
all the shit that I didn't really have.
Or,
you know,

80
00:04:21.490 --> 00:04:24.220
all the good qualities that I think I,
you know,
I could have maybe had,

81
00:04:24.221 --> 00:04:25.150
if I was raised the right way,

82
00:04:25.151 --> 00:04:28.780
I'm trying to give my son and I think that's a really big responsibility and

83
00:04:28.781 --> 00:04:33.430
that's why,
you know,
you,
I feel bad when you see like real violence like that,

84
00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:36.490
like fucking people that are like being really,
you're like,
dude,

85
00:04:36.491 --> 00:04:39.150
I know that person experienced some crazy shit.
100%.

86
00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:42.940
It's not their fault in a weird way.
And it's definitely not,
you know,

87
00:04:42.941 --> 00:04:44.800
I never lived in the worst neighborhood in the world,

88
00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:47.950
but I lived in a shady one for quite a bit.

89
00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:50.580
We lived in this place called Jamaica Plain,
uh,

90
00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:53.730
outside of Boston for about a year and my parents knew immediately who he gotta

91
00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:56.980
get the fuck out of there.
We only,
I think we stayed maybe a year,

92
00:04:57.220 --> 00:05:00.310
a little over a year and a,
we got out of there as quick as we can,

93
00:05:00.311 --> 00:05:04.300
but there was like a lot of breakins.
A lot of it was lower income.

94
00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:08.890
It wasn't terrible.
It wasn't like a gang violence,
shoot them up type shit.

95
00:05:08.891 --> 00:05:12.820
But there was a lot of criminals.
Yeah.
A lot of shady shit.
Shit.
By poverty.

96
00:05:12.821 --> 00:05:15.520
It doesn't have to,
it doesn't have to be like gangs.
It's just shitty.

97
00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:19.450
Do poverty makes people do crazy shit.
It does.
And it makes,

98
00:05:19.451 --> 00:05:22.300
I was never around kids that were that aggressive,
like kids.

99
00:05:22.301 --> 00:05:25.480
We're always trying to fight me.
And um,
I just moved there.

100
00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:28.120
We just moved there from Florida and I was like,
fuck,

101
00:05:28.121 --> 00:05:31.750
I gotta get Outta here and this is what led me to martial art Heller.
You 13.

102
00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:35.850
Okay.
You know,
teenage boy,
almost a man.

103
00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:38.620
You're going through puberty at this point.
That's it.
You know,
it's a scary time.

104
00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:40.690
And there was all these kids that were just,

105
00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:44.080
there were so they had already fucked.
They're already doing drugs.

106
00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:49.390
It's just to make a plane,
low income white or white and Puerto Rican,

107
00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:54.310
like,
uh,
mostly that.
Mostly white and Puerto Rican.
It was a lot of it.

108
00:05:54.660 --> 00:05:59.260
Uh,
just a lot of cigarette smokers at 13 kids are smoking cigarettes already.

109
00:05:59.530 --> 00:06:00.530
They were drinking all the time.

110
00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:03.560
I used to like my mom's cigarettes for her when I was with his hands like crazy.

111
00:06:03.590 --> 00:06:04.910
I swear to God.
Great.

112
00:06:04.911 --> 00:06:08.060
Fitzsimmons lived in a house with two parents that were chain smokers in an

113
00:06:08.061 --> 00:06:10.460
apartment and they never open the windows in the winter.
Are you crazy?

114
00:06:10.461 --> 00:06:13.700
My mom never,
there was no sense.

115
00:06:13.730 --> 00:06:18.410
My mom smoked her entire pregnancy with me.
Me Dog.
Yeah.
I mean they don't look,

116
00:06:18.411 --> 00:06:19.910
once again,
she doesn't know kind of,

117
00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:23.930
they knew date sorta new jewelry was out on smoking while you were pregnant.

118
00:06:23.931 --> 00:06:27.980
I think in [inaudible] 82 when I was born for 82 I'm 67 you your mom was zero

119
00:06:27.981 --> 00:06:29.770
excuses.
Oh,
I thought you,
I think

120
00:06:31.940 --> 00:06:33.260
my mom was in the 60s man.

121
00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:38.280
They didn't know the 60s it was like you had to read a book and she's new 20 you

122
00:06:38.370 --> 00:06:42.860
know,
my mom was 22 my mom was 20 like that.
It's crazy.

123
00:06:42.861 --> 00:06:44.720
Imagine that.
How old were you when you had your first kid?

124
00:06:44.750 --> 00:06:49.550
Grazie a 40 year four that's fuck.
That's so perfect.

125
00:06:49.610 --> 00:06:53.030
Yeah.
Such a perfect time.
I was 30 which is fine.
It's too young,

126
00:06:53.060 --> 00:06:56.760
and I think my mom was 18 when she had my sister.
Yeah.
Um,

127
00:06:58.370 --> 00:07:03.370
it's just the,
just the act of weather.
No one,

128
00:07:03.371 --> 00:07:06.410
when you start it with,
if you started at 20,
if you start at 40,

129
00:07:06.620 --> 00:07:11.060
the act of raising another human being,
it just changes who the fuck you are,

130
00:07:11.630 --> 00:07:16.610
but just does everything switches and gets weird.
And then you're like,

131
00:07:16.640 --> 00:07:18.170
oh,
I'm responsible for,

132
00:07:18.410 --> 00:07:22.400
for shaping your life and Italy's helping to shape your life.

133
00:07:22.401 --> 00:07:25.420
And if I do a good job,
you'll be a good person.

134
00:07:25.460 --> 00:07:29.270
You'll go out there and you'll make more good people and you'll meet good
people,

135
00:07:29.540 --> 00:07:33.360
which is really what everybody wants at the end of the day,
everybody wants.
