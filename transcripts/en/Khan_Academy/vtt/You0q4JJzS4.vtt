00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:02.350
- [Instructor] What we're going
to talk about in this video

00:00:02.350 --> 00:00:04.530
is Voter Turnout.

00:00:04.530 --> 00:00:06.670
Which is a way of thinking about, well,

00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:10.360
how many of the people who
could vote actually do vote?

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:12.930
It's often expressed as a
number, as a percentage,

00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:17.580
where you have the number
who vote, number who vote,

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:19.470
over the number of eligible voters.

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:24.110
Number who could vote, who could vote.

00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:27.710
And this percentage
varies pretty dramatically

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:31.270
from region to region, amongst
various demographic groups,

00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:33.120
we'll talk about that in a few minutes,

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:34.760
and especially if you think about,

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:38.510
even sometimes year to year
and from country to country.

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:40.710
There's some countries
that have mandatory voting,

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:42.150
where this number is a lot higher,

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:43.840
other countries, for various reasons,

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:45.650
this number could be lot lower.

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:47.260
And one thing for you to think about

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:48.510
if you're already of voting age,

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:49.990
you might have already thought this,

00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:52.410
or if you're not voting
yet, you will soon,

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:54.410
what would drive you to vote,

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:55.760
or what would drive you to not vote?

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:58.170
Stay home, or somehow
keep you from engaging

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.610
in this political process.

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:04.220
Well one thing that you'll
often hear folks say is

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:06.150
does my vote matter?

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:10.330
Does my vote matter?

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:13.170
And the typical response that
you would get if you say that

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:14.540
is well if everyone thought that,

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:17.490
then democracy really won't function,

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.400
so yes, your vote does matter.

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:21.210
So that's the high-level
way of thinking about it,

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:24.240
but everyone thinks about
this to a certain degree.

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:27.870
And this idea of thinking
about whether your vote matters

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:29.730
a fancy way of describing that

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:32.950
is you're thinking about
your Political Efficacy.

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:35.823
Political efficacy.

00:01:36.772 --> 00:01:38.222
Fancy political science term,

00:01:39.463 --> 00:01:40.450
but it's really just this idea of

00:01:41.492 --> 00:01:43.923
what's my belief about how
politically effective I can be

00:01:43.923 --> 00:01:45.860
when I vote.

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:49.100
If I am in a battleground
State, say Florida,

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:51.370
where even Presidential Elections

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:53.730
have turned on a few hundreds of votes,

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:55.250
in Florida, you might say, hey,

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:57.140
I have high political efficacy.

00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:58.970
My vote does matter there.

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:01.120
But some folks who live in a State

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:04.180
that may be strongly leaning
towards one party or another

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:05.650
during a Presidential Election,

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:09.030
say a California, that
tends to go to a Democrat,

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:11.720
or say a Texas, that tends
to go to a Republican,

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:13.080
regardless of which party you are,

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:14.400
you'd say, well if I'm just one more

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:16.990
Republican vote in Texas,
does my vote matter?

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:19.800
If I'm one more Democratic
vote in California,

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:21.120
does my vote matter?

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:23.330
I would encourage you in both
cases, your vote does matter.

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:24.672
If everyone believed that,

00:02:24.672 --> 00:02:27.920
then our democracy does not function.

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:31.200
Now a related idea to political efficacy

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:36.061
is this idea of just
how engaged are people?

00:02:36.061 --> 00:02:38.061
So I'll call that engagement.

00:02:38.061 --> 00:02:39.850
And this might be, well
how much do they care?

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:42.050
So beyond does my vote matter,

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:44.950
there's a notion of do I care?

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:46.790
There are certain elections

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:49.610
where you might really like one candidate

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:52.070
or might really dislike another candidate.

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:54.910
You might think, hey, there's
some big issues on the table

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:57.200
that rally affect my life.

00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:59.680
So I might be more engaged.

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:01.990
Or frankly, the various candidates,

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:05.190
or the various political parties
or community organizations

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:08.410
might just be better at
engaging the population.

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:09.810
Now a third dimension

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:12.790
beyond whether people
believe their vote matters

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:16.070
or how engaged they are in
the issues or the candidates

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:19.070
is the structure around voting itself.

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:22.080
What State Laws are there around voting,

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:26.090
and how easy or how hard is it to vote?

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:28.868
So, for example, if there's
a big window of time

00:03:28.868 --> 00:03:30.280
where people can vote,

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:32.820
and if the polling places
are really accessible,

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:35.160
especially if they're
available on say a holiday,

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:38.600
then it might be easier for
people to actually go to vote.

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:41.050
But on the other hand, if
they aren't that accessible,

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:43.270
or if it's on a day where a lot
of folks might need to work,

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:45.290
or certain demographics
might need to work,

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:48.160
well they might be less
likely to turn out.

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:50.760
You also have laws
around absentee ballots,

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:52.730
or people being able
to vote ahead of time.

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:54.870
The easier it is logistically to vote,

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:56.270
the more accessible it is,

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:58.340
you're gonna get a higher turnout.

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:01.660
Now political scientists
don't just study voter turnout

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:04.080
to understand the past.

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:05.050
They look at the past

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:07.030
to try and make predictions
about the future.

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:08.740
The next Congressional Election,

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:10.113
the next Presidential Election,

00:04:10.113 --> 00:04:13.240
if they're trying to figure
out which way it might go,

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:16.070
you can't just survey
people alone and say,

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:18.790
well are you gonna vote for
this candidate or that candidate

00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:19.670
because you also have to think about

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:21.350
how likely are they to vote.

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:24.570
And that likelihood could
be based on various factors.

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:25.920
It might be based on their age,

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:27.120
it might be based on their race,

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:29.080
it might be based on
their education level.

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:30.500
And to appreciate that,

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:33.680
let's start taking a look at some data.

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:34.900
This chart right over here

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:37.010
shows voter turnout by sex and age

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:40.640
in the 2008 US Presidential Election,

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:44.230
where the blue bars are males,
and the red bars are females.

00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:47.090
And then you can see the
different age groups.

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:48.090
And so pause this video.

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:49.560
It's just fun to look at these things.

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:51.853
What take-aways are there here?

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:55.350
Well, you can see if you look at

00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:59.460
all of the eligible voters,
total, 18 years and over,

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:02.660
that women had a higher
voter turn-out than men.

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:07.660
60.4% of eligible women
vote, only 55.7% of men.

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:09.600
Think about why that might be.

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:11.130
What beliefs might women have

00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:15.080
around their own political
efficacy relative to men?

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:16.440
Maybe they're more engaged,

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:17.850
maybe there's issues on the table

00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:19.940
that they care more about.

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:22.020
And then if you look by age group,

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:24.430
that trend tends to be true.

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:27.420
It's most pronounced at
the younger age groups,

00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:29.210
but then things get more and more equal

00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:31.160
as we go to the older age groups.

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:33.220
The only place where
that trend breaks down

00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:35.470
is in 75 years and over.

00:05:35.470 --> 00:05:37.299
And then you also have the general trend

00:05:37.299 --> 00:05:41.090
that older folks are more likely to vote.

00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:43.600
Once again, why is that?

00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:45.810
Here's another interesting chart.

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:48.590
This is voter turnout by
educational attainment,

00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:52.190
for the same US
Presidential Election, 2008.

00:05:52.190 --> 00:05:56.540
So you can see that on average,
across all education levels,

00:05:56.540 --> 00:06:00.780
you have this voter turnout around 58.2%,

00:06:00.780 --> 00:06:02.950
but the more educated people get,

00:06:02.950 --> 00:06:05.590
the more they're likely, or
at least in that election,

00:06:05.590 --> 00:06:08.630
the more likely they
were to actually vote.

00:06:08.630 --> 00:06:11.720
The more educated people are,
they might feel more engaged,

00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:14.720
they might have a better belief
that their vote is effective

00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:17.590
so they have a belief
around political efficacy.

00:06:17.590 --> 00:06:22.110
This is voter turnout in the
2008 US Presidential Election

00:06:22.110 --> 00:06:24.210
by race and ethnicity.

00:06:24.210 --> 00:06:27.550
And so here you see that in that election,

00:06:27.550 --> 00:06:32.550
White voters had 64.8%
turnout, Black voters 60.8%,

00:06:32.910 --> 00:06:35.500
and you can see Asian and Hispanic voters

00:06:35.500 --> 00:06:37.010
were much, much lower.

00:06:37.010 --> 00:06:39.040
What does this say about
political engagement,

00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:39.873
and what does it say

00:06:39.873 --> 00:06:42.770
about their beliefs
around political efficacy?

00:06:42.770 --> 00:06:44.960
And to see trends over time,

00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:48.380
I'm going to go to the
site of FairVote.org,

00:06:48.380 --> 00:06:51.010
which is a really great
non-partisan non-profit

00:06:51.010 --> 00:06:52.830
that is trying to think about

00:06:52.830 --> 00:06:55.610
how to we get a better democracy.

00:06:55.610 --> 00:06:57.570
So this diagram right over here

00:06:57.570 --> 00:07:01.900
shows voter turnout
rates from 1916 to 2016.

00:07:01.900 --> 00:07:04.130
And there's two different lines here.

00:07:04.130 --> 00:07:06.260
The top one is in Presidential Elections,

00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:08.580
this is the 2016 Presidential Election,

00:07:08.580 --> 00:07:10.200
and this bottom line right over here

00:07:10.200 --> 00:07:11.700
is the Mid-Term elections.

00:07:11.700 --> 00:07:14.410
So this is where there isn't
someone running for president.

00:07:14.410 --> 00:07:18.360
Why do you think that
there's such a big gap here?

00:07:18.360 --> 00:07:20.310
That pretty consistently,

00:07:20.310 --> 00:07:22.610
you have a much higher voter turnout

00:07:22.610 --> 00:07:24.430
in this, depending on
what year you look at,

00:07:24.430 --> 00:07:28.810
but say in 2016, you
have a 60% voter turnout,

00:07:28.810 --> 00:07:31.560
while in the Mid-Term Election of 2014,

00:07:31.560 --> 00:07:33.110
you didn't even break 40%.

00:07:33.110 --> 00:07:35.940
You had little under 36% voter turnout.

00:07:35.940 --> 00:07:38.683
Why do you think you have this big gap?

00:07:39.690 --> 00:07:41.620
Well you could probably
turn to these ideas

00:07:41.620 --> 00:07:44.220
of political efficacy and engagement.

00:07:44.220 --> 00:07:46.860
One thing that people talk
about around Congressional Seats

00:07:46.860 --> 00:07:49.810
is that there tends to not be
a lot of turnover around it.

00:07:49.810 --> 00:07:51.240
In other videos, we've talked about

00:07:51.240 --> 00:07:54.910
how the districts might be
shaped to benefit incumbents,

00:07:54.910 --> 00:07:57.420
the entire process might
be benefiting incumbents,

00:07:57.420 --> 00:07:58.330
so people might say, hey,

00:07:58.330 --> 00:08:00.690
I have a very low political efficacy here.

00:08:00.690 --> 00:08:03.060
Most Congresspeople
tend to stay in office,

00:08:03.060 --> 00:08:06.493
so maybe that's why they
don't really go out to vote,

00:08:06.493 --> 00:08:09.300
and there might be an
engagement thing going on,

00:08:09.300 --> 00:08:10.930
that on Presidential years,

00:08:10.930 --> 00:08:14.100
where also Congresspeople
are up for re-election,

00:08:14.100 --> 00:08:15.320
or up for election,

00:08:15.320 --> 00:08:16.610
the reason why people go out to vote

00:08:16.610 --> 00:08:17.800
is that Presidential Elections

00:08:17.800 --> 00:08:19.620
are these really big dramatic things,

00:08:19.620 --> 00:08:20.800
they take over the press,

00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:22.730
they take over everyone's attention.

00:08:22.730 --> 00:08:24.460
Now another interesting thing
to think about is the trend.

00:08:24.460 --> 00:08:26.940
Why, say, in Presidential Elections,

00:08:26.940 --> 00:08:28.740
actually in Presidential
and in Mid-Term Elections,

00:08:28.740 --> 00:08:33.740
do you have such high
engagement in the 1960s,

00:08:33.970 --> 00:08:38.500
relative to, say, the 1980s and 1990s,

00:08:38.500 --> 00:08:40.400
where things got pretty low?

00:08:40.400 --> 00:08:42.393
One argument could be
that the 1960s was a time

00:08:42.393 --> 00:08:44.810
of very high political engagement.

00:08:44.810 --> 00:08:46.550
You had the Vietnam War going on,

00:08:46.550 --> 00:08:48.630
you had the Civil Rights Movement.

00:08:48.630 --> 00:08:52.330
Now if we scroll down on
FairVote right over here,

00:08:52.330 --> 00:08:56.690
we can see voter turnout in
the 2016 elections by State.

00:08:56.690 --> 00:09:01.020
And the deeper the purple
here, the higher the turnout.

00:09:01.020 --> 00:09:03.560
And so what patterns do you see here?

00:09:03.560 --> 00:09:04.650
And I'll give you a hint.

00:09:04.650 --> 00:09:07.020
Think about which States
are battleground States.

00:09:07.020 --> 00:09:09.280
The ones that could flip either way,

00:09:09.280 --> 00:09:11.090
or the ones that could
have flipped either way

00:09:11.090 --> 00:09:12.693
in the 2016 election.

00:09:13.710 --> 00:09:15.250
Well you can see the deeper purple

00:09:15.250 --> 00:09:19.579
are on States like Florida,
or in States like Ohio,

00:09:19.579 --> 00:09:23.250
or Wisconsin and (mumbles), Michigan.

00:09:23.250 --> 00:09:26.230
These are indeed battleground States.

00:09:26.230 --> 00:09:28.240
So you can imagine folks in those States

00:09:28.240 --> 00:09:31.253
believed that they had
higher political efficacy.

00:09:32.610 --> 00:09:36.020
Now in the 2014 elections,
you don't see it as dramatic.

00:09:36.020 --> 00:09:38.130
This is a Mid-Term election year.

00:09:38.130 --> 00:09:39.460
So people are thinking a lot less

00:09:39.460 --> 00:09:42.340
about the Electoral College
and Presidential Elections,

00:09:42.340 --> 00:09:43.930
so it isn't as all or nothing

00:09:43.930 --> 00:09:45.340
as they are in the Electoral College

00:09:45.340 --> 00:09:46.570
in the Presidential Elections,

00:09:46.570 --> 00:09:48.210
so you don't see it as pronounced.

00:09:48.210 --> 00:09:50.350
But if you go back to 2012,

00:09:50.350 --> 00:09:52.660
which was a Presidential Election year,

00:09:52.660 --> 00:09:54.620
you see the same pattern again.

00:09:54.620 --> 00:09:57.740
That the battleground
States are a deeper color.

00:09:57.740 --> 00:09:59.190
So I will leave you there.

00:09:59.190 --> 00:10:02.300
You should vote, that's just
my public service message,

00:10:02.300 --> 00:10:04.050
but it's interesting to think about

00:10:04.050 --> 00:10:07.153
why, in general, voter
turnout might change.
