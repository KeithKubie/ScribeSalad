00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:03.320
Welcome back! Let's connect the dots. We

00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:05.590
started with the technical issues in the

00:00:05.590 --> 00:00:07.810
structure of an operating system for a

00:00:07.810 --> 00:00:11.060
single CPU, then a parallel machine, then a

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:15.090
distributed system. We saw how object technology

00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:19.120
with it's innate concepts of inheritance and

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:22.470
reuse helps in structuring operating systems at

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:26.260
different levels. Now, we go one step further.

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:28.980
How do we structure the system software for

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:31.850
a large scale distributed system service? It's too

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:34.260
limiting to call it an operating system. Large

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.830
scale distributed service. As we continue this lesson,

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:40.480
we'll get a glimpse of how object technology

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:43.990
has gone ballistic to provide the services that

00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:47.450
you're reliant on for your everyday internet e-commerce

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:51.460
experience. In this lesson, we will describe enterprise java

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:54.890
beans and the term java bean is used to

00:00:54.890 --> 00:01:01.060
signify reusable software components. That is many objects, java objects,

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:03.120
in a bundle so that it can be passed

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:06.860
around easily from one application to another application for reuse.
