00:00:14.239 --> 00:00:17.089
Geckos and grasshoppers, worms and watermelons,

00:00:17.089 --> 00:00:19.756
elephants and Escherichia Coli,

00:00:19.756 --> 00:00:24.738
man and mushroom. All so different in form and function,

00:00:24.738 --> 00:00:28.604
but amazingly the same in how their form and function are determined.

00:00:28.604 --> 00:00:32.656
First, all these organisms are made of one or more cells,

00:00:32.656 --> 00:00:36.083
and every cell of every living thing on earth

00:00:36.114 --> 00:00:38.139
contains all the information it takes

00:00:38.139 --> 00:00:42.473
to create and duplicate and make variations of itself.

00:00:42.473 --> 00:00:45.624
That information is stored in a very long but quite simple

00:00:45.624 --> 00:00:48.156
double molecule called DNA,

00:00:48.156 --> 00:00:50.958
or Deoxyribonucleic Acid.

00:00:50.958 --> 00:00:56.306
And the DNA of every living organism is made of chains of four smaller molecules

00:00:56.306 --> 00:01:01.389
called nucleotides. What dictates the difference between a man and a mushroom

00:01:01.389 --> 00:01:06.423
is the sequence of these nucleotides in the long DNA chain.

00:01:06.423 --> 00:01:09.673
The four differing nucleotide parts, called bases,

00:01:09.673 --> 00:01:14.273
are made of a few carbon, oxygen, hydrogen, nitrogen and phosphorus atoms,

00:01:14.273 --> 00:01:17.125
and the molecules look like this.

00:01:17.125 --> 00:01:21.806
And each of these four bases is attached to an identical backbone molecule,

00:01:21.806 --> 00:01:27.490
a sugar called deoxyribose - the "D" in DNA - and a phosphate group.

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:31.506
Let's simplify these nucleotides and show them like this.

00:01:31.506 --> 00:01:37.125
So, a single sequence of nucleotides joined by their common sugars would look like this.

00:01:37.125 --> 00:01:43.323
And the DNA molecule where such sequences are stored looks like this.

00:01:43.323 --> 00:01:49.523
But how does a simple molecule dictate the form and function of millions of different living things?

00:01:49.523 --> 00:01:53.689
You can think of DNA as a great library of information,

00:01:53.689 --> 00:01:57.939
information that is used to do one thing and one thing only:

00:01:57.939 --> 00:02:01.124
direct the building of different protein molecules.

00:02:01.124 --> 00:02:04.458
And it's the proteins that build the cells and keep them functioning

00:02:04.458 --> 00:02:10.056
and changing and reproducing. Here's where the familiar word 'gene' comes in.

00:02:10.056 --> 00:02:15.056
If your DNA is a library of information, a gene is a book in that library.

00:02:15.056 --> 00:02:18.457
A gene is a segment of the DNA molecule.

00:02:18.457 --> 00:02:22.105
Let's say your body needs a particular protein, like insulin.

00:02:22.105 --> 00:02:26.073
To get it, some of your cells send a protein signal through the bloodstream

00:02:26.073 --> 00:02:29.339
to the cells in your pancreas, where insulin is made.

00:02:29.339 --> 00:02:33.106
That signal protein tells other proteins in the cell's nuclei

00:02:33.106 --> 00:02:37.340
to open up a part of the DNA double helix, the insulin gene,

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:39.572
and start making insulin proteins.

00:02:39.572 --> 00:02:41.673
As soon as enough insulin has been produced,

00:02:41.673 --> 00:02:46.939
another signal protein comes to the pancreas' cells that tells them to stop making insulin.

00:02:46.939 --> 00:02:50.322
It's like looking up a book in the DNA library about insulin,

00:02:50.322 --> 00:02:52.457
and then putting it back when you're done.

00:02:52.457 --> 00:02:56.807
There are genes in DNA for visible and invisible things that make up your body,

00:02:56.807 --> 00:03:00.306
like genes for eye color, protein pigments, for skin color,

00:03:00.306 --> 00:03:03.523
for hair color, for stopping and starting bone growth,

00:03:03.523 --> 00:03:07.089
for your blood type, for how many fingers or arms and legs you have,

00:03:07.089 --> 00:03:11.023
for proteins that influence how long you live.

00:03:11.023 --> 00:03:16.188
Your DNA probably contains between 25 thousand and 40 thousand genes,

00:03:16.188 --> 00:03:19.106
while the DNA of a worm or a plant or a fruit fly

00:03:19.106 --> 00:03:22.823
contains about 12 thousand to 20 thousand genes.

00:03:22.823 --> 00:03:26.989
Some of those genes have quite different sequences of nucleotides than yours,

00:03:26.989 --> 00:03:29.273
and some are similar to yours.

00:03:29.273 --> 00:03:31.140
Though it happens infrequently,

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:33.673
our own nucleotide sequences can change

00:03:33.673 --> 00:03:36.989
as the result of spontaneous or environmental damage

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:40.555
which might remove or shift a nucleotide position.

00:03:40.555 --> 00:03:45.106
This changes the gene involved, and can then change the protein.

00:03:45.106 --> 00:03:47.406
Most of these changes, called mutations,

00:03:47.406 --> 00:03:51.356
have very little effect on the organism or its descendants.

00:03:51.356 --> 00:03:52.839
some are mildly damaging,

00:03:52.839 --> 00:03:56.739
and a few can make the organism better-suited to its environment.

00:03:56.739 --> 00:04:02.189
It is these tiny changes in DNA gene sequences, happening over millions of years,

00:04:02.189 --> 00:04:06.906
that create the differences among living organisms, from geckos to grasshoppers.

00:04:06.906 --> 00:04:13.056
worms to watermelons, elephants to Escherichia Coli, and man to mushroom.
