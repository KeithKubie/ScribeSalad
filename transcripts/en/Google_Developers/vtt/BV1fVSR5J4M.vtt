JENNY MURPHY: Hi everyone.

00:00:02.260 --> 00:00:05.370
Welcome to this week's session
of the Google+

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:07.190
Platform Office hours.

00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:10.810
This week we're joined by the
Tabletop top forage Team, and

00:00:10.810 --> 00:00:12.980
they're going to tell us about
their experiences developing

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:14.680
this really cool Hangout app.

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:17.060
And we're also going
to see a demo.

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:20.850
So before we get going, I'll
just introduce myself and

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:21.810
everyone around me.

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:22.770
I'm Jenny Murphy.

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:26.110
I'm a Developer Programs
Engineer here at Google on the

00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:28.050
Google+ platform.

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:28.790
And next to me--

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:30.690
JONATHAN BERRY: Jonathan Berry,
I'm the developer

00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:33.270
advocate for Google+
Hangout apps.

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:34.810
WILLIAM THOMPSON: And
I'm Will Thomson.

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:36.690
I'm a developer program
engineer on

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:38.345
Hangout apps, as well.

00:00:38.345 --> 00:00:42.570
JENNY MURPHY: And then behind
the camera, Shrag is helping

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:43.880
us with audio video stuff.

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:47.480
It looks like he's going to come
over and do a lean in.

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:48.070
There you go.

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:49.786
There is someone behind
the camera.

00:00:49.786 --> 00:00:52.270
Ya, Shrag!

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:58.036
And joining us, via the magic
of Hangouts, we have Allen.

00:00:58.036 --> 00:01:00.036
ALLEN: Hi there.

00:01:00.036 --> 00:01:03.396
JENNY MURPHY: We have Charles.

00:01:03.396 --> 00:01:04.185
CHARLES: Hey.

00:01:04.185 --> 00:01:05.340
JENNY MURPHY: Joshua.

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:06.645
JOSHUA: Hello.

00:01:06.645 --> 00:01:07.950
JENNY MURPHY: And Frasier.

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:10.405
FRASIER: Hi everybody.

00:01:10.405 --> 00:01:11.420
JENNY MURPHY: Cool.

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:15.210
OK, so I guess we might as
well get started with the

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:17.120
demo, and we'll check
out this cool app.

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:21.280
And then we will barrage
you questions.

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:22.090
Charles, I think you
were going to be

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:25.030
doing the demo screen.

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:26.732
Fire it on up.

00:01:26.732 --> 00:01:27.985
CHARLES: Alright, let me
screen-share this.

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:40.884
So can everybody see that?

00:01:40.884 --> 00:01:42.820
JENNY MURPHY: Yep,
so we see a map.

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:45.510
And those of you on-air may not
be able to see the texts,

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:47.046
but you'll just have
to trust us that

00:01:47.046 --> 00:01:47.910
there's text there, too.

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:49.180
We'll talk you through it.

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:50.913
JONATHAN BERRY: So before you
get into the screen share, why

00:01:50.913 --> 00:01:53.276
don't you give us a little
overview of what you built.

00:01:53.276 --> 00:01:58.020
CHARLES: OK, well so it's a
little bit complicated.

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:02.100
Josh and I both started building
same app, basically.

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:05.960
And we started talking about
building our app, and we

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:08.800
started talking about how we
were both doing it, and

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:14.120
talking to the community that
already exists in Google+ of

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:15.910
role playing gamers.

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:19.015
And every time we talked, we
kind of realized that were

00:02:19.015 --> 00:02:21.630
doing the same thing slightly
differently.

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:25.010
It was kind of like convergent
evolution, he's making a shark

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:27.740
and I'm making a dolphin, but
they both end up looking

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:28.900
pretty much the same.

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:32.860
So I can't speak for Josh, but
I certainly came to the

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:37.260
realization that there was too
much here to do for just me in

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:39.690
my spare time, because I'm
a programmer full time.

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:43.070
And that takes up a fair chunk
of my time, and I'm a dad when

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:44.870
I'm not doing that.

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:50.410
So we've decided to just pool
our efforts and build one app

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:54.250
that serves the needs
of the community.

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:59.900
So we're building a role playing
game, or RPG app, that

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:03.210
lets people play RPGs
in the Hangouts.

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:06.310
So I guess the most
commonly known RPG

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:08.540
is Dungeons &amp; Dragons.

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:13.530
It's a game in which one person
creates a world with

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:17.670
The Lord of the Rings kind of
world, and everybody plays a

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:23.946
character in that world, Gimli
or one of the elves, or one of

00:03:23.946 --> 00:03:25.720
the hobbits.

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:28.830
And so you go around, and you
have adventures, and you do

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:30.810
various different things that
your character is able to do,

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:33.050
and some characters are good
at some things, and other

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:36.010
characters are good at other
things, and you explore, and

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:38.710
you become more powerful,
and so on, and so forth.

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:42.260
But really what it is, it's a
shared tactical game, but it's

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:45.420
also a shared storytelling
experience.

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:48.030
One person comes up with the
overarching world, and

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:51.496
everybody else figures out how
they're going to behave in

00:03:51.496 --> 00:03:53.332
that world, how they're going to
interact in that world, how

00:03:53.332 --> 00:03:56.640
they're going to make themselves
part of that world.

00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:00.230
So it's a really creative
set of games.

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:04.170
So RPGs are not just a game,
they're a set of games.

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:08.100
Some of them are set in our
world, in an alternate version

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:10.070
of our world, in the future,
the past, in a

00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:12.110
galaxy far, far away.

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:15.110
The most commonly known ones,
like Dungeons &amp; Dragons, are

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:22.010
set in a medieval fantasy
setting, mostly pilfered from

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:22.680
The Lord of the Rings.

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:25.990
There are post apocalyptic ones,
and so on, and so forth.

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:28.430
So with any world you can
imagine you mix some worlds

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:31.430
and throw people into it, and
then you pretend that you're

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:32.950
walking around the world.

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:36.790
So normally what's done for
this style of game is that

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:42.040
there is a table in between the
players, or around which

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:43.660
the players gather.

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:46.735
And sometimes there's a map,
sometimes they'll have tokens

00:04:46.735 --> 00:04:50.860
to represent yourself moving
around on the map.

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:54.230
And almost always you'll have
dice, or in some cases cards

00:04:54.230 --> 00:04:57.960
that you draw randomly to
determine how well you succeed

00:04:57.960 --> 00:04:59.980
or fail doing something.

00:04:59.980 --> 00:05:04.130
So the two main components of
a table top when you're

00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:09.030
playing are the ability to roll
dice, where everybody can

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:11.740
see you roll the dice, so you
can't cheat, and say you got

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:13.730
something you didn't get.

00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:17.570
And, in a lot of cases the
ability to put up a map, and

00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:19.970
then move around the map.

00:05:19.970 --> 00:05:22.520
In some cases you want to put
up pictures to give people a

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:26.530
feeling of what they see, or
what they're interacting with.

00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:30.020
But in any case it comes down
to an image that is in a

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:31.610
shared environment.

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:34.380
And so that's why Hangouts
are so good for this.

00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:37.370
A lot of people have been making
virtual table tops for

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:42.040
a lot of years, but in most of
you can't see each other, you

00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:45.000
don't have that shared
videoconferencing, you have

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:49.510
some degree of sharing the same
elements, the map, or the

00:05:49.510 --> 00:05:51.010
rolling of the dice.

00:05:51.010 --> 00:05:52.590
You can text each other.

00:05:52.590 --> 00:05:55.616
But, in my opinion, and Josh
can maybe speak to this a

00:05:55.616 --> 00:05:59.040
little more, Google Hangouts
really just gives you the

00:05:59.040 --> 00:05:59.520
whole package.

00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:02.160
It gives you the ability to see
everybody, as if you're

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:03.640
sitting around the same table.

00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:08.010
It gives you the ability to
create a space where you can

00:06:08.010 --> 00:06:10.360
all interact with the same
elements, as if you're all

00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:13.960
rolling the same dice, or
looking at the same map.

00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:17.290
So that's, I guess, the
starting of it.

00:06:17.290 --> 00:06:19.980
So what I've put up here in
the app is a map that I've

00:06:19.980 --> 00:06:23.360
uploaded, that I didn't draw.

00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:26.440
I believe this one is
from Fantastic Maps.

00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:30.020
Jonathan is a fantastic
map drawer.

00:06:30.020 --> 00:06:35.060
And so this is, I believe,
this a chunk of his.

00:06:35.060 --> 00:06:40.030
And on the right hand side is
the window where we have

00:06:40.030 --> 00:06:43.025
rebuilt the chat function with
some of added functionalities.

00:06:43.025 --> 00:06:46.200
So you can roll dice
in the chat window.

00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:49.320
So you type /d and then
you type in what

00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:50.550
dice you want to roll.

00:06:50.550 --> 00:06:54.180
I want to roll two six sided
dice, so I write 2D6, and I've

00:06:54.180 --> 00:06:58.980
got a bonus plus 3, so I go
plus 3, and I roll it.

00:06:58.980 --> 00:07:00.950
And I don't know if you can see
it in this resolution, but

00:07:00.950 --> 00:07:03.980
I rolled a 9 out of 12.

00:07:03.980 --> 00:07:05.190
JONATHAN BERRY: I love that.

00:07:05.190 --> 00:07:08.430
CHARLES: And so now I'm trying
to do something, I need an

00:07:08.430 --> 00:07:10.560
eight, I roll a nine,
everybody's happy, I've

00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:13.670
succeeded in doing it,
and we carry on.

00:07:13.670 --> 00:07:15.480
If I'd rolled the dice
on my desktop.

00:07:15.480 --> 00:07:18.890
I would have had to point my
camera at my desktop, or you'd

00:07:18.890 --> 00:07:20.920
just all had to have taken
my word for it.

00:07:20.920 --> 00:07:22.870
And more often than not, if I
really needed to make the

00:07:22.870 --> 00:07:25.170
roll, I'd just lie, and tell
you that I'd done it.

00:07:25.170 --> 00:07:26.780
JONATHAN BERRY: And
we have done that.

00:07:26.780 --> 00:07:30.610
We've taken the camera, and
joined a hangout with an extra

00:07:30.610 --> 00:07:34.500
account, pointed the camera at
the table, and I was rolling

00:07:34.500 --> 00:07:37.100
dice to show for everybody.

00:07:37.100 --> 00:07:38.240
And you can see it
on the camera.

00:07:38.240 --> 00:07:40.360
But this is a much more
elegant solution.

00:07:40.360 --> 00:07:43.630
CHARLES: I don't know why they
don't just trust me and accept

00:07:43.630 --> 00:07:46.800
that I got what I rolled.

00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:50.950
ALLEN: Speaking of trust,
speaking of trust, can I ask a

00:07:50.950 --> 00:07:53.220
quick technical question
at this point?

00:07:53.220 --> 00:07:57.980
That die roll, is that taking
place on your machine, on the

00:07:57.980 --> 00:08:02.040
DM's machine, from Central
server, or where exactly did

00:08:02.040 --> 00:08:04.790
that take place, and how does
everyone else trust that?

00:08:04.790 --> 00:08:08.320
JOSHUA: So right now it does
take place on the client, so

00:08:08.320 --> 00:08:11.020
theoretically if somebody really
want to know what they

00:08:11.020 --> 00:08:13.600
were doing and hack JavaScript
files, they can mess with it.

00:08:13.600 --> 00:08:17.840
But the event syncing that
senses the other clients

00:08:17.840 --> 00:08:21.350
through the Google state
object uses a certain

00:08:21.350 --> 00:08:23.520
formatting of the messaging
that might be hard to

00:08:23.520 --> 00:08:25.510
reproduce if they didn't know
what they were doing.

00:08:25.510 --> 00:08:28.840
Eventually, I mean we are doing
some stuff server side

00:08:28.840 --> 00:08:31.960
for handling local files and
stuff like that, so it

00:08:31.960 --> 00:08:34.630
wouldn't be too hard to move
the random number generator

00:08:34.630 --> 00:08:38.510
part of that to the server,
but for now we're trusting

00:08:38.510 --> 00:08:39.909
that no one's messing around
with the clients.

00:08:39.909 --> 00:08:41.012
WILLIAM THOMPSON: If it's
Dungeons and Dragons, you

00:08:41.012 --> 00:08:44.000
could always be like, and a rock
falls out of the sky and

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:44.855
crushes you.

00:08:44.855 --> 00:08:46.644
CHARLES: Exactly.

00:08:46.644 --> 00:08:50.180
Well you know this is actually
a case of an example of the

00:08:50.180 --> 00:08:52.020
convergent evolution
that we had.

00:08:52.020 --> 00:08:55.060
And this is why when Josh and
I finally decided to work

00:08:55.060 --> 00:08:57.863
together, we went through
this a few times, trying

00:08:57.863 --> 00:09:00.660
to merge our work.

00:09:00.660 --> 00:09:05.260
But once you get under the skin,
we realized that how we

00:09:05.260 --> 00:09:06.880
were doing it was
quite different.

00:09:06.880 --> 00:09:10.040
Every time it just seemed
like too much trouble.

00:09:10.040 --> 00:09:13.910
So Josh is doing this, I
believe, in JavaScript all in

00:09:13.910 --> 00:09:15.090
the client side.

00:09:15.090 --> 00:09:19.520
What I was doing was I was
posting about JSON to an

00:09:19.520 --> 00:09:24.850
Apache server, and running PHP
to parche the text and to come

00:09:24.850 --> 00:09:27.610
up with the random die results,
and then posting that

00:09:27.610 --> 00:09:31.310
back and to the client, and
from there into the shared

00:09:31.310 --> 00:09:35.290
state, and then pushing
it to everybody else.

00:09:35.290 --> 00:09:38.350
So two totally different ways
of doing exactly the same

00:09:38.350 --> 00:09:41.000
thing, but when it came down to
an integrating one with the

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:42.816
other, it was just apples
and oranges.

00:09:46.216 --> 00:09:48.640
ALLEN: And that's part of why
I asked the question is

00:09:48.640 --> 00:09:51.280
because there are obviously a
lot of different approaches

00:09:51.280 --> 00:09:52.550
that can go with it.

00:09:52.550 --> 00:09:55.350
I want to know which one you
guys chose, and kind of your

00:09:55.350 --> 00:09:57.870
thinking behind why
you chose that.

00:09:57.870 --> 00:10:03.020
And especially when you're
talking games, how do you find

00:10:03.020 --> 00:10:05.190
the right a comfort level
between security and

00:10:05.190 --> 00:10:05.850
playability.

00:10:05.850 --> 00:10:09.800
JOSHUA: Right, OK so for the
main mechanism of how we're

00:10:09.800 --> 00:10:13.430
actually sharing everything,
first of all, we are using the

00:10:13.430 --> 00:10:15.320
shared state objects.

00:10:15.320 --> 00:10:20.100
It does have a limit of the 10K
size, so we actually don't

00:10:20.100 --> 00:10:22.760
share when you add
an image there.

00:10:22.760 --> 00:10:26.860
We just share the event that
player X added an image, and

00:10:26.860 --> 00:10:29.520
then in the shared state object
we share out the URL,

00:10:29.520 --> 00:10:32.130
the size of image, the location
of the image, and we

00:10:32.130 --> 00:10:34.700
essentially replay that
on all of the clients.

00:10:34.700 --> 00:10:37.040
So we're using the state
object kind of

00:10:37.040 --> 00:10:37.760
like an event engine.

00:10:37.760 --> 00:10:40.790
And as soon as it processes that
event from that person,

00:10:40.790 --> 00:10:43.952
it clears it from the state.

00:10:43.952 --> 00:10:48.660
CHARLES: So the two aspects of
this is that are that you've

00:10:48.660 --> 00:10:51.610
got a limit of 10K in the shared
state, which needs to

00:10:51.610 --> 00:10:53.970
be very conservative about what
you put in there, and you

00:10:53.970 --> 00:10:57.710
have to clean it up when
you're done with it.

00:10:57.710 --> 00:11:00.240
And then the other thing is,
that because there's so many

00:11:00.240 --> 00:11:05.010
browsers, cross browser
compatibility becomes a big

00:11:05.010 --> 00:11:10.780
issue, which is why I chose
to go the JSON PHP route.

00:11:10.780 --> 00:11:14.060
Because once you're at PHP,
you're on a server that's

00:11:14.060 --> 00:11:14.770
completely separate.

00:11:14.770 --> 00:11:17.230
You know what the environment
is, and it always works the

00:11:17.230 --> 00:11:18.410
same every single time.

00:11:18.410 --> 00:11:22.760
As long as you can do the JSON
event, and parse the result on

00:11:22.760 --> 00:11:25.510
every browser, it doesn't
matter what it

00:11:25.510 --> 00:11:26.960
is that you're doing.

00:11:26.960 --> 00:11:31.475
So we're still in the process
of working this out.

00:11:31.475 --> 00:11:34.940
The Tabletop Forge has turned
out to be remarkably stable.

00:11:34.940 --> 00:11:37.030
But these are, obviously,
questions that we're going to

00:11:37.030 --> 00:11:40.390
be asking every single time
we do anything in here.

00:11:40.390 --> 00:11:42.550
And the more complex it gets,
the more we're going to have

00:11:42.550 --> 00:11:44.390
to examine those things.

00:11:44.390 --> 00:11:48.270
JONATHAN BERRY: So I think last
week you asked a similar

00:11:48.270 --> 00:11:51.790
question about security,
especially about storing local

00:11:51.790 --> 00:11:54.260
config files.

00:11:54.260 --> 00:11:58.850
So in games it's interesting,
because no matter how smart

00:11:58.850 --> 00:12:00.850
you want to be with the
JavaScript, you

00:12:00.850 --> 00:12:02.130
can always hack it.

00:12:02.130 --> 00:12:04.502
You can obfuscate it, you can
encrypt it, but at the end of

00:12:04.502 --> 00:12:08.090
the day, you can't trust it.

00:12:08.090 --> 00:12:09.145
WILLIAM THOMPSON: Everybody
can read your files.

00:12:09.145 --> 00:12:11.040
JONATHAN BERRY: Everybody can
read the files, and then if

00:12:11.040 --> 00:12:14.030
you're doing shared state stuff,
then you can maybe even

00:12:14.030 --> 00:12:16.600
read the files, or change
people's files

00:12:16.600 --> 00:12:17.700
on their own apps.

00:12:17.700 --> 00:12:22.170
So the way games specifically
do it, they actually have a

00:12:22.170 --> 00:12:25.910
server that models
the entire world.

00:12:25.910 --> 00:12:28.690
So they have a state of
everything stored.

00:12:28.690 --> 00:12:32.660
Every player, their values,
their turns, and then when

00:12:32.660 --> 00:12:36.910
somebody wants to make a move,
you request that server,

00:12:36.910 --> 00:12:39.325
saying is this a valid move?

00:12:39.325 --> 00:12:40.610
You know, I trust you.

00:12:40.610 --> 00:12:42.990
And then you go back
and forth.

00:12:42.990 --> 00:12:46.901
So that's more secure
way of doing things.

00:12:46.901 --> 00:12:49.760
WILLIAM THOMPSON: You guys also
have, especially with the

00:12:49.760 --> 00:12:52.320
dice, you have an event
tracker there.

00:12:52.320 --> 00:12:55.980
And even if somebody goes in and
changes your shared state,

00:12:55.980 --> 00:12:57.860
each client has a record
of what's going on.

00:12:57.860 --> 00:13:00.898
So ultimately, because
transactional that way, you

00:13:00.898 --> 00:13:03.068
can walk back up the
transactions and see if

00:13:03.068 --> 00:13:03.810
somebody was cheating.

00:13:03.810 --> 00:13:08.420
CHARLES: The thing, too, is that
I wrestled with these,

00:13:08.420 --> 00:13:12.530
and I'm sure Josh has as well,
we're trying to model reality.

00:13:12.530 --> 00:13:15.676
And in reality you can put
your finger on the

00:13:15.676 --> 00:13:16.850
die and tip it over.

00:13:16.850 --> 00:13:19.020
You can put your hand up so
that people don't see what

00:13:19.020 --> 00:13:19.590
you're doing.

00:13:19.590 --> 00:13:22.360
You could move the pieces of
paper back off the map so you

00:13:22.360 --> 00:13:25.570
can see in rooms that you
actually haven't explored yet.

00:13:25.570 --> 00:13:30.760
At some point it ruins
the game to do that.

00:13:30.760 --> 00:13:32.300
If your going to have people
cheating, they're going to

00:13:32.300 --> 00:13:34.350
find a way to cheat, anyways.

00:13:34.350 --> 00:13:38.320
And because we're not building
a game system, we're building

00:13:38.320 --> 00:13:40.880
a system for a whole
host of games.

00:13:40.880 --> 00:13:43.396
Some of which use maps, some of
which use tokens, some of

00:13:43.396 --> 00:13:46.670
which use dice, some
of which use cards.

00:13:46.670 --> 00:13:52.790
The more you lock it down, the
more you exclude some games,

00:13:52.790 --> 00:13:56.930
and make it so it only works
with other games.

00:13:56.930 --> 00:14:00.010
My personal goal is to lock it
down as much as you can to

00:14:00.010 --> 00:14:03.220
ensure that what somebody does
is what everybody sees.

00:14:03.220 --> 00:14:05.950
But then beyond that to leave
it as loose as possible, to

00:14:05.950 --> 00:14:09.155
that works for everyone.

00:14:09.155 --> 00:14:10.770
And then you just
trust people.

00:14:10.770 --> 00:14:14.450
If the GM gets up and goes to
the bathroom and comes back he

00:14:14.450 --> 00:14:17.200
just trusts that nobody's
looked at the map.

00:14:17.200 --> 00:14:20.100
There's not that somebody's
there as a

00:14:20.100 --> 00:14:20.835
guard to watch that.

00:14:20.835 --> 00:14:23.490
ALLEN: Well I think that--

00:14:23.490 --> 00:14:26.390
CHARLES: We trust that you
haven't taken six hours to

00:14:26.390 --> 00:14:30.080
figure out how to reverse
engineer the program and you

00:14:30.080 --> 00:14:31.450
always get a good roll.

00:14:34.040 --> 00:14:36.270
It ruins the game for the
players as much as it ruins

00:14:36.270 --> 00:14:37.620
the game for the GM.

00:14:37.620 --> 00:14:38.950
ALLEN: And I think that that's
an important point.

00:14:38.950 --> 00:14:41.660
Most of the games that we're
talking about right now are

00:14:41.660 --> 00:14:42.920
social games.

00:14:42.920 --> 00:14:46.890
And if you rig the game so
that it's always in your

00:14:46.890 --> 00:14:48.846
favor, people just aren't
going to want

00:14:48.846 --> 00:14:49.490
to play with you.

00:14:49.490 --> 00:14:54.264
If you're always rolling six on
a D6, people are going to

00:14:54.264 --> 00:14:57.432
say, meh, why do I want to play
with this guy anyway?

00:14:57.432 --> 00:14:59.875
CHARLES: Yeah, I was going to
share this later, but I'll

00:14:59.875 --> 00:15:02.280
share this now, actually,
because it fits in with what

00:15:02.280 --> 00:15:03.430
we're talking about here.

00:15:03.430 --> 00:15:06.250
This is one of the next things
that we're working on, it's

00:15:06.250 --> 00:15:07.820
called the fog of war.

00:15:07.820 --> 00:15:10.875
So it's the equivalent of
putting down pieces of paper

00:15:10.875 --> 00:15:13.150
over a top of a map that
has more than the

00:15:13.150 --> 00:15:15.620
players explored on it.

00:15:15.620 --> 00:15:20.830
So this is a map with, let's
say, four players and the X is

00:15:20.830 --> 00:15:23.430
meant to represent some extra
person who isn't actually a

00:15:23.430 --> 00:15:27.740
player, but he's along for the
ride, a non-player character.

00:15:27.740 --> 00:15:30.540
And this shows where
everybody is.

00:15:30.540 --> 00:15:33.090
Bruce Cordell is the
blue person, I'm in

00:15:33.090 --> 00:15:35.270
there over to the right.

00:15:35.270 --> 00:15:36.950
And this is what we've
all discovered.

00:15:36.950 --> 00:15:37.430
And this is what we've
all discovered.

00:15:37.430 --> 00:15:41.220
We've found this little alcove,
and there appears to

00:15:41.220 --> 00:15:43.910
be an opening here in
front of bricks.

00:15:43.910 --> 00:15:48.670
So the idea will be that we will
layer canvas over top of

00:15:48.670 --> 00:15:51.240
one another with a map
of the bottom.

00:15:51.240 --> 00:15:54.485
And in the simplest example,
there will be one layer over

00:15:54.485 --> 00:15:57.670
the top of another, just
as in Photoshop.

00:15:57.670 --> 00:15:59.120
And the top will be the gray.

00:15:59.120 --> 00:16:00.540
It'll be the fog of war.

00:16:00.540 --> 00:16:02.940
And you can only see what you
have already explored.

00:16:02.940 --> 00:16:09.695
So if Bruce moves down this
path here, the gem will be

00:16:09.695 --> 00:16:12.340
able to reveal this
corridor to him.

00:16:12.340 --> 00:16:16.760
And as you travel through the
game, you'll be able to view

00:16:16.760 --> 00:16:17.910
more and more.

00:16:17.910 --> 00:16:20.070
Now, again, this is imminently
hackable.

00:16:20.070 --> 00:16:23.540
You could go and figure out
where this image resides, and

00:16:23.540 --> 00:16:27.460
go and download it, and cheat
it and look ahead.

00:16:27.460 --> 00:16:29.310
But that's like being the
banker in Monopoly, and

00:16:29.310 --> 00:16:32.260
getting interest free loans.

00:16:32.260 --> 00:16:35.720
Which I did as a child,
and I regret it.

00:16:35.720 --> 00:16:38.541
I don't regret it,
but I'm ashamed.

00:16:38.541 --> 00:16:41.390
FRASIER: But I definitely see
that issue, and I do think

00:16:41.390 --> 00:16:44.090
it's pretty valid.

00:16:44.090 --> 00:16:49.690
I think what we are exploring
here is sort of potentially

00:16:49.690 --> 00:16:52.570
something as interesting as a
lot of the social game that's

00:16:52.570 --> 00:16:55.685
already happening, the stuff
that Zynga and people like

00:16:55.685 --> 00:16:57.410
that are doing.

00:16:57.410 --> 00:17:00.250
Those games you're changing
numbers in the database

00:17:00.250 --> 00:17:05.000
somewhere and managing
your farm.

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:07.260
It doesn't really appeal to me
at all, but I love the idea of

00:17:07.260 --> 00:17:08.619
being able to play
a game of chess

00:17:08.619 --> 00:17:10.270
against other human being.

00:17:10.270 --> 00:17:12.599
Can you imagine all of the
poker games that could be

00:17:12.599 --> 00:17:19.180
happening out there as people
are playing games against

00:17:19.180 --> 00:17:22.920
other human beings the way
nature really intended.

00:17:22.920 --> 00:17:25.700
So I think that a lot of these
issues are definitely going to

00:17:25.700 --> 00:17:30.540
come back to the foreground over
time as it stops being

00:17:30.540 --> 00:17:35.650
just a bunch of individual
people just getting together

00:17:35.650 --> 00:17:37.110
with their existing social
connections.

00:17:37.110 --> 00:17:40.040
You could imagine open forums
where people who love a

00:17:40.040 --> 00:17:41.650
certain kind of game could
be dropped into

00:17:41.650 --> 00:17:42.810
a game right away.

00:17:42.810 --> 00:17:45.085
They can start playing with
DM, you could see the

00:17:45.085 --> 00:17:46.110
reputations of the DM.

00:17:46.110 --> 00:17:47.310
You could bring your characters

00:17:47.310 --> 00:17:49.260
from one game to another.

00:17:49.260 --> 00:17:52.500
I mean the possibilities
of this are endless,

00:17:52.500 --> 00:17:55.834
and scale up forever.

00:17:55.834 --> 00:17:57.990
CHARLES: And the security issues
are significant and

00:17:57.990 --> 00:17:59.700
important, and I think
we'll address them.

00:17:59.700 --> 00:18:05.930
But right now adding features
and working on stability are

00:18:05.930 --> 00:18:06.800
the priorities.

00:18:06.800 --> 00:18:10.100
And we're trusting people that
they're not going to ruin

00:18:10.100 --> 00:18:11.710
their own experience.

00:18:11.710 --> 00:18:14.330
At some point we'll go back and
lock everything down, I'm

00:18:14.330 --> 00:18:16.020
sure to an extent.

00:18:16.020 --> 00:18:18.380
FRASIER: Yeah, but I think
it's addressing a whole

00:18:18.380 --> 00:18:22.270
paradigm that actually works so
with what Google+ is, and

00:18:22.270 --> 00:18:27.130
what the hangouts are all about,
which is instead of

00:18:27.130 --> 00:18:29.530
updating My Farm, let's get
together, hang out, let's play

00:18:29.530 --> 00:18:32.120
a game, and let's have a shared
environment of space

00:18:32.120 --> 00:18:34.080
that supports that and really
encourages that.

00:18:34.080 --> 00:18:35.880
JONATHAN BERRY: Yeah, that's
a really good point.

00:18:35.880 --> 00:18:38.600
The way we describe hangout
apps, in general, is we say

00:18:38.600 --> 00:18:40.700
hangouts are social
by default.

00:18:40.700 --> 00:18:43.250
You don't hang out
by yourself.

00:18:43.250 --> 00:18:45.670
And, hanging out with one
or two people is not so

00:18:45.670 --> 00:18:46.280
interesting.

00:18:46.280 --> 00:18:49.810
But it's when you have this room
of nine other people that

00:18:49.810 --> 00:18:51.780
things get really interesting,
and the

00:18:51.780 --> 00:18:53.070
conversation starts flowing.

00:18:53.070 --> 00:18:56.400
And hangout Apps, by extension,
are social, by

00:18:56.400 --> 00:18:58.690
nature, by default rather.

00:18:58.690 --> 00:19:02.030
And so games that require you
to have a bunch of people

00:19:02.030 --> 00:19:05.714
hanging out and doing stuff
together is the model that we

00:19:05.714 --> 00:19:06.470
want to build.

00:19:06.470 --> 00:19:09.700
So table games, obviously,
are perfect for that.

00:19:09.700 --> 00:19:13.750
And they have a lot of
engagement, long time spans,

00:19:13.750 --> 00:19:15.580
and so this is a good model.

00:19:18.360 --> 00:19:21.300
I think a lot of times we get
solved problems. And for you

00:19:21.300 --> 00:19:23.000
guys building off the
[UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:25.155
probably is the first thing.

00:19:25.155 --> 00:19:26.720
WILLIAM THOMPSON: And then the
other thing is that because

00:19:26.720 --> 00:19:30.200
it's Google+, you know who
you're dealing with, and

00:19:30.200 --> 00:19:32.900
there's a reputational aspect
there, already.

00:19:32.900 --> 00:19:35.180
It's sort of like if
somebody's really--

00:19:35.180 --> 00:19:39.150
it's always funny to get hung up
on security in a game that

00:19:39.150 --> 00:19:43.790
is ultimately about shared
imagination.

00:19:43.790 --> 00:19:49.800
CHARLES: But for us, building
the app is a game, too.

00:19:49.800 --> 00:19:52.120
So we want to do it as perfectly
as we possibly can.

00:19:52.120 --> 00:19:54.420
So you run into some sort of
problem, and you think,

00:19:54.420 --> 00:19:57.100
awesome, a problem.

00:19:57.100 --> 00:19:59.580
You don't think, ah
crap, a problem.

00:19:59.580 --> 00:20:05.808
So doing all of that is going
to be just fun to do.

00:20:05.808 --> 00:20:08.660
Right now every time we talk
about the app, we get gamers

00:20:08.660 --> 00:20:10.650
going, oh and can we do this?

00:20:10.650 --> 00:20:13.780
Oh, we want Tarot cards,
oh and I want a deck.

00:20:13.780 --> 00:20:14.670
WILLIAM THOMPSON: Oh, and we
were thinking about, oh you

00:20:14.670 --> 00:20:16.097
could learn a site on the maps,
and then you could do--

00:20:18.840 --> 00:20:21.190
CHARLES: I don't think I've seen
a single comment that's

00:20:21.190 --> 00:20:23.290
been, my players cheat.

00:20:23.290 --> 00:20:25.593
I want you to make sure that
they don't mess with their

00:20:25.593 --> 00:20:26.380
dice rolls.

00:20:26.380 --> 00:20:31.310
It's all, I want to upload this,
I want to do a video,

00:20:31.310 --> 00:20:34.840
give me tokens that look
like little orcs.

00:20:34.840 --> 00:20:35.942
WILLIAM THOMPSON: I want to
play music through the

00:20:35.942 --> 00:20:37.660
plug-ins, so that everybody
has a soundtrack.

00:20:37.660 --> 00:20:39.875
JOSHUA: That's actually
in the roadmap.

00:20:43.371 --> 00:20:46.452
FRASIER: And there's the face
tracking, so you can give

00:20:46.452 --> 00:20:49.730
people costumes when they show
up, give them a little helmet

00:20:49.730 --> 00:20:51.800
or elf ears.

00:20:51.800 --> 00:20:53.310
WILLIAM THOMPSON: Everybody's
supposed to be somebody,

00:20:53.310 --> 00:20:55.720
there's always the classic
middle school role-playing

00:20:55.720 --> 00:20:59.830
where you forget what gender
your character is, you keep

00:20:59.830 --> 00:21:01.360
switching back and forth.

00:21:01.360 --> 00:21:04.570
It's like, no, you'd actually
put on the hair and makeup and

00:21:04.570 --> 00:21:05.858
everything, and actually
be able to do it.

00:21:05.858 --> 00:21:06.950
No that would be awesome.

00:21:06.950 --> 00:21:08.300
CHARLES: So that's an
interesting thing.

00:21:08.300 --> 00:21:11.260
There's a real balance there,
because a lot of people, I

00:21:11.260 --> 00:21:14.630
include myself among them, don't
like to see a lot of

00:21:14.630 --> 00:21:19.022
visuals, because I like it all
to happen in my imagination.

00:21:19.022 --> 00:21:20.940
It's like watching a movie once
you've read the book.

00:21:20.940 --> 00:21:23.110
You imagine what Harry Potter
looks like, and you go see the

00:21:23.110 --> 00:21:25.730
movie, and you're like,
that's not him.

00:21:25.730 --> 00:21:27.590
And then you go back and reread
the book, and you can't

00:21:27.590 --> 00:21:29.100
imagine m the way you
did originally.

00:21:29.100 --> 00:21:31.470
He looks like the movie actor.

00:21:31.470 --> 00:21:34.140
Oh, there's a little bit of my
imagination thrown away.

00:21:34.140 --> 00:21:35.600
WILLIAM THOMPSON: You can
definitely explore the

00:21:35.600 --> 00:21:38.845
costuming with an extension
that's running in parallel for

00:21:38.845 --> 00:21:41.780
the people who--

00:21:41.780 --> 00:21:43.030
JOSHUA: Yeah, optionally.

00:21:46.980 --> 00:21:48.580
One of the things that we we're
actually exploring was,

00:21:48.580 --> 00:21:52.873
besides the face tracking
effects with the visuals is a

00:21:52.873 --> 00:21:55.950
kind of augmented reality
condition marker.

00:21:55.950 --> 00:22:00.020
So that if your character was
in a confused state, or was

00:22:00.020 --> 00:22:02.450
poisoned, you would have
a floating green

00:22:02.450 --> 00:22:04.800
skull above your head.

00:22:04.800 --> 00:22:06.650
FRASIER: You can see how many
hit points you have left.

00:22:06.650 --> 00:22:09.180
The GM at a glance can
see who needs to be

00:22:09.180 --> 00:22:10.250
beaten up a little harder.

00:22:10.250 --> 00:22:12.995
ALLEN: Well but even better is
that depending on how many hit

00:22:12.995 --> 00:22:16.931
points you've lost, your face
gets bloodier and bloodier.

00:22:16.931 --> 00:22:20.600
CHARLES: Ending with little Xs
over your eyes when you die.

00:22:20.600 --> 00:22:22.760
WILLIAM THOMPSON: We support
multiple overlays.

00:22:22.760 --> 00:22:26.603
You can actually continue
to add scar tissue

00:22:26.603 --> 00:22:27.355
to people as they--

00:22:27.355 --> 00:22:30.780
JOSHUA: Right, but you can
only still tie them to

00:22:30.780 --> 00:22:31.880
something being tracked,
right?

00:22:31.880 --> 00:22:34.460
You can't put them
static, yet.

00:22:34.460 --> 00:22:38.860
So if I move my head, my HP
camera would move around in

00:22:38.860 --> 00:22:40.940
circles or something.

00:22:40.940 --> 00:22:45.010
WILLIAM THOMPSON: Right this
second you can do it with the

00:22:45.010 --> 00:22:49.410
set Avatar, and then just
bounce that state.

00:22:49.410 --> 00:22:55.770
Everybody updates, because the
set fish tracking overlay

00:22:55.770 --> 00:22:58.110
attaches it to your stream, and
then whatever you do gets

00:22:58.110 --> 00:22:59.580
seen by everybody else.

00:22:59.580 --> 00:23:03.260
But set avatar actually is
individual for each client.

00:23:03.260 --> 00:23:06.900
So I'll make an extension that
turns you into an Android, but

00:23:06.900 --> 00:23:08.300
you don't even know
that happened.

00:23:08.300 --> 00:23:09.900
JONATHAN BERRY: I think Alan
just loaded up his caption

00:23:09.900 --> 00:23:11.822
app, attention rather.

00:23:11.822 --> 00:23:14.631
ALLEN: Yeah, but it's
not working today.

00:23:14.631 --> 00:23:19.980
CHARLES: Well we did at one
point, we're redoing it now,

00:23:19.980 --> 00:23:23.080
is little tooltips over
top of your icon.

00:23:23.080 --> 00:23:27.050
So when you start the game, your
avatar appears as a small

00:23:27.050 --> 00:23:28.440
icon on the map.

00:23:28.440 --> 00:23:30.465
And when you roll over, you get
a little tool tip over top

00:23:30.465 --> 00:23:33.050
that shows some text.

00:23:33.050 --> 00:23:35.080
JONATHAN BERRY: I think also
[UNINTELLIGIBLE] made a lower

00:23:35.080 --> 00:23:39.920
thirds extension that could be
very useful, that has your

00:23:39.920 --> 00:23:41.250
character's name
at the bottom.

00:23:41.250 --> 00:23:43.450
WILLIAM THOMPSON: Do you guys
have orientation for your

00:23:43.450 --> 00:23:43.880
characters?

00:23:43.880 --> 00:23:47.270
I realize that fourth edition
D&amp;D doesn't do orientation.

00:23:47.270 --> 00:23:51.340
JOSHUA: Yeah there's a right
click contextual menu options

00:23:51.340 --> 00:23:52.250
on the tokens.

00:23:52.250 --> 00:23:55.010
So you can rotate them or
increase or decrease the size

00:23:55.010 --> 00:23:56.660
or lock them so nobody
else can move them,

00:23:56.660 --> 00:23:57.910
that kind of thing.

00:24:01.640 --> 00:24:03.345
JONATHAN BERRY: I think we have
some questions prepared.

00:24:03.345 --> 00:24:05.320
JENNY MURPHY: Yeah, we have a
couple questions, although you

00:24:05.320 --> 00:24:07.050
guys answered most of them
through your chatter.

00:24:07.050 --> 00:24:09.010
That's the best way to do it.

00:24:09.010 --> 00:24:11.740
So I realise you guys have been
developing since about

00:24:11.740 --> 00:24:14.780
the beginning of the Hangouts
apps, the Hangouts API.

00:24:14.780 --> 00:24:17.755
And it was pretty rough,
especially at the beginning.

00:24:17.755 --> 00:24:20.210
Would you mind telling us about
some of the interesting

00:24:20.210 --> 00:24:22.980
challenges you overcame
as you were developing

00:24:22.980 --> 00:24:24.586
the Tabletop Forge?

00:24:24.586 --> 00:24:29.060
JOSHUA: Sure, so one is,
obviously, the limited size of

00:24:29.060 --> 00:24:30.730
the state object.

00:24:30.730 --> 00:24:32.930
So when I first was attempting
to do this when you added a

00:24:32.930 --> 00:24:35.590
map, I was trying to figure out
a way-- well I just want

00:24:35.590 --> 00:24:38.020
to share the whole image through
the state when it was

00:24:38.020 --> 00:24:39.570
a 100K image.

00:24:39.570 --> 00:24:41.960
Obviously, even as a
data URI, that just

00:24:41.960 --> 00:24:42.850
wouldn't fit in there.

00:24:42.850 --> 00:24:44.980
So that's when I came up with
the concept, well if it's a

00:24:44.980 --> 00:24:47.590
URL, I can just share that
URL, instead, through the

00:24:47.590 --> 00:24:50.690
state object, and have everyone
add that to the DOM

00:24:50.690 --> 00:24:56.170
through that method, rather than
having to fit 100K object

00:24:56.170 --> 00:24:58.180
in there every time.

00:24:58.180 --> 00:24:59.590
That was definitely
a challenge.

00:25:02.180 --> 00:25:05.050
It's actually still a challenge,
because the state

00:25:05.050 --> 00:25:07.360
object doesn't refresh--

00:25:07.360 --> 00:25:09.540
I mean it's pretty fast, but
sometimes there's a little bit

00:25:09.540 --> 00:25:10.240
of a lag in there.

00:25:10.240 --> 00:25:13.140
So you have to account
for that some times.

00:25:13.140 --> 00:25:17.160
CHARLES: I think I found one of
my problems was balancing

00:25:17.160 --> 00:25:20.220
the number of times I
wanted to refresh

00:25:20.220 --> 00:25:22.240
from the state object.

00:25:22.240 --> 00:25:25.740
And I periodically get into
these little infinite loops

00:25:25.740 --> 00:25:28.880
where I would update state
object, and the state object,

00:25:28.880 --> 00:25:31.900
because it was updated would
tell me to update again, and

00:25:31.900 --> 00:25:33.780
over, and over, and over,
and around again.

00:25:33.780 --> 00:25:38.180
And the problem is that I
develop by myself, and I play

00:25:38.180 --> 00:25:39.080
with others.

00:25:39.080 --> 00:25:42.670
And so all of a sudden you're
developing with nobody in the

00:25:42.670 --> 00:25:46.030
room, and suddenly you put other
people in the room, and

00:25:46.030 --> 00:25:48.320
their doing all sorts of things
that you couldn't

00:25:48.320 --> 00:25:50.400
possibly have debugged
for yourself.

00:25:50.400 --> 00:25:50.980
WILLIAM THOMPSON: Well
you're lying.

00:25:50.980 --> 00:25:52.450
Jonathan's saying that you don't
hangout by yourself,

00:25:52.450 --> 00:25:54.390
except developers.

00:25:54.390 --> 00:25:58.316
I hangout by myself
all the time.

00:25:58.316 --> 00:26:00.970
CHARLES: That's like looking
in a mirror.

00:26:00.970 --> 00:26:04.610
That is actually a problem that
I ran into, that I didn't

00:26:04.610 --> 00:26:07.700
find a really good solution to
it was that I wasn't able to

00:26:07.700 --> 00:26:12.090
reproduce, in that way,
the live environment.

00:26:12.090 --> 00:26:14.180
My dev environment was
inherently different from the

00:26:14.180 --> 00:26:16.180
live environment.

00:26:16.180 --> 00:26:21.260
And I could've stolen my wife's
computer, and join her

00:26:21.260 --> 00:26:23.130
to the Hangout.

00:26:23.130 --> 00:26:24.320
And as long as she
wasn't using her

00:26:24.320 --> 00:26:25.420
computer, it worked fine.

00:26:25.420 --> 00:26:28.930
It would just be an empty
room, but without hack.

00:26:28.930 --> 00:26:31.580
FRASIER: And I think early on
some of the problems we had

00:26:31.580 --> 00:26:34.900
was that there wasn't a lot
of control over the actual

00:26:34.900 --> 00:26:35.800
hangout environments.

00:26:35.800 --> 00:26:38.310
We had a lot of problems being
able to get the video to show

00:26:38.310 --> 00:26:41.280
in the same kind of way that
the Hangouts work.

00:26:41.280 --> 00:26:44.970
So with this, you see that
whoever is talking shows up as

00:26:44.970 --> 00:26:46.890
the big picture.

00:26:46.890 --> 00:26:49.990
And so before, all you had was
the thumbnail, and you had no

00:26:49.990 --> 00:26:52.810
way to control the big window.

00:26:52.810 --> 00:26:57.130
But a lot of it was us nagging
the API team to give us more

00:26:57.130 --> 00:26:58.920
and more control over
the different

00:26:58.920 --> 00:27:01.760
elements of the interface.

00:27:01.760 --> 00:27:04.550
And now I think everything
that we want

00:27:04.550 --> 00:27:06.710
to do it is in there.

00:27:06.710 --> 00:27:10.030
JENNY MURPHY: Great.

00:27:10.030 --> 00:27:12.730
FRASIER: So thank you for
being so receptive.

00:27:12.730 --> 00:27:16.790
CHARLES: I would like to add
the app to the on-air

00:27:16.790 --> 00:27:17.480
functionality.

00:27:17.480 --> 00:27:18.780
I think that would be great.

00:27:18.780 --> 00:27:21.020
I would like to be able to play
the game and have people

00:27:21.020 --> 00:27:23.470
watching the game while other
players are in there.

00:27:23.470 --> 00:27:26.200
FRASIER: Yeah, I mean this is
the big idea that we've been

00:27:26.200 --> 00:27:26.850
thinking about.

00:27:26.850 --> 00:27:31.350
Wouldn't it be cool to pull
together a lot of the Google+

00:27:31.350 --> 00:27:33.770
celebrities, and have a big role
playing game with them

00:27:33.770 --> 00:27:36.860
all at the same time, and bring
in some celebrity DMs,

00:27:36.860 --> 00:27:38.110
and do that as a
Hangout on-air?

00:27:38.110 --> 00:27:40.790
I think it would
be really fun.

00:27:40.790 --> 00:27:44.070
Right now there's no way that
we can think of to actually

00:27:44.070 --> 00:27:46.870
drag this functionality through
into hangouts on-air.

00:27:46.870 --> 00:27:49.490
JONATHAN BERRY: So you can
screen share on hangouts

00:27:49.490 --> 00:27:50.060
on-air, right?

00:27:50.060 --> 00:27:51.080
WILLIAM THOMPSON: Yeah, people
have been doing that.

00:27:51.080 --> 00:27:54.440
JONATHAN BERRY: And then you
can an app in your hangout.

00:27:54.440 --> 00:27:57.690
So is that what you want to
do, or is it a little

00:27:57.690 --> 00:27:58.910
different than that?

00:27:58.910 --> 00:28:02.950
WILLIAM THOMPSON: So the screen
share isn't quite as

00:28:02.950 --> 00:28:08.370
instantly updating as putting
the app native to it.

00:28:08.370 --> 00:28:12.440
JONATHAN BERRY: Yeah, you
got to do the on-air.

00:28:12.440 --> 00:28:14.000
Is that what you're
thinking, though?

00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:17.920
FRASIER: Yeah, so for example,
right now we can't actually

00:28:17.920 --> 00:28:22.640
access the app in this hangout
and actually display it out in

00:28:22.640 --> 00:28:26.130
a way to the audience as
watching this hangout.

00:28:26.130 --> 00:28:27.460
JOSHUA: We kind of can.

00:28:27.460 --> 00:28:31.000
So when Charles loaded it
earlier, if you saw, I

00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:33.210
actually was able to make roll
that showed on his screen.

00:28:33.210 --> 00:28:36.710
So we access it all locally.

00:28:36.710 --> 00:28:40.970
One person has to screen share
from one person's view, but it

00:28:40.970 --> 00:28:41.960
does sort of work.

00:28:41.960 --> 00:28:43.910
FRASIER: Right, and so you can
imagine that it would need to

00:28:43.910 --> 00:28:47.560
be some sort of separate version
that's presented as

00:28:47.560 --> 00:28:51.320
part of the hangout on-air, and
then the various players

00:28:51.320 --> 00:28:53.300
have their own access
to it and their own

00:28:53.300 --> 00:28:54.010
version of it as well.

00:28:54.010 --> 00:28:56.910
Its just you've got one
extra player that's

00:28:56.910 --> 00:28:59.080
just watching, right?

00:28:59.080 --> 00:29:02.410
CHARLES: Also because of the
lag, as Josh was pointing out

00:29:02.410 --> 00:29:05.260
at the beginning of this, I had
to turn off my main video,

00:29:05.260 --> 00:29:09.350
because re-sharing the video
was causing lag.

00:29:09.350 --> 00:29:12.190
And you never see the face of
the person who's sharing it.

00:29:16.386 --> 00:29:19.640
JENNY MURPHY: We need an
additional headless view.

00:29:19.640 --> 00:29:22.700
Because for cases like the game,
you're going to have to

00:29:22.700 --> 00:29:26.170
potentially have different
visibility for your view

00:29:26.170 --> 00:29:27.240
versus the player's views.

00:29:27.240 --> 00:29:30.440
JONATHAN BERRY: Well, and you
can insert the video canvas

00:29:30.440 --> 00:29:31.230
into your app.

00:29:31.230 --> 00:29:33.485
So you could insert back in.

00:29:33.485 --> 00:29:35.780
JOSHUA: Yeah, we have that
there, but that's he was

00:29:35.780 --> 00:29:36.010
talking about.

00:29:36.010 --> 00:29:36.940
He had to minimize it.

00:29:36.940 --> 00:29:39.880
Because once he started screen
sharing, it just got really--

00:29:39.880 --> 00:29:41.730
I mean that's pretty
insensitive to put

00:29:41.730 --> 00:29:43.056
that video up there.

00:29:43.056 --> 00:29:46.276
CHARLES: Yeah, having a main
video in there's good.

00:29:46.276 --> 00:29:49.220
FRASIER: Yeah, I mean I think
the solutions that we've

00:29:49.220 --> 00:29:53.090
thought about is more stripping
it down, and having

00:29:53.090 --> 00:29:57.490
one video that just contains the
game information happening

00:29:57.490 --> 00:30:02.100
in it, and then having that act
like a virtual camera that

00:30:02.100 --> 00:30:04.530
contains that information.

00:30:04.530 --> 00:30:10.150
And then whoever is the director
of the show is

00:30:10.150 --> 00:30:13.020
switching back and forth
as required.

00:30:13.020 --> 00:30:15.000
If someone rolls a die, we'll
switch back over, and show the

00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:17.310
die getting rolled, then
we go back to the game.

00:30:17.310 --> 00:30:20.495
So it's just a whole other
layer of complexity.

00:30:20.495 --> 00:30:22.390
But I think it would be
really interesting.

00:30:22.390 --> 00:30:27.625
I would love to play a game with
Vick and Sergey and all

00:30:27.625 --> 00:30:28.680
those guys.

00:30:28.680 --> 00:30:31.000
WILLIAM THOMPSON: We'll leave
them with shortened shields

00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:32.434
too, if possible.

00:30:32.434 --> 00:30:33.390
I would think.

00:30:33.390 --> 00:30:36.650
FRASIER: Are they really
game geeks?

00:30:36.650 --> 00:30:38.728
Let's find out.

00:30:38.728 --> 00:30:41.060
CHARLES: And there's lots of
guys in the gaming industry

00:30:41.060 --> 00:30:45.980
that you would never read
outside of a con that you can

00:30:45.980 --> 00:30:47.750
play with, or that you
can watch play.

00:30:47.750 --> 00:30:51.240
It would be really cool to watch
Wil Wheaton and Monte

00:30:51.240 --> 00:30:58.250
Cook and Peter Atkinson
play D&amp;D.

00:30:58.250 --> 00:31:00.500
So if they were going to play
the game, they're going to

00:31:00.500 --> 00:31:01.310
play it on Hangout, maybe.

00:31:01.310 --> 00:31:04.320
But still, nobody's ever going
to see it unless they save it

00:31:04.320 --> 00:31:05.520
and post it to YouTube.

00:31:05.520 --> 00:31:07.715
Really cool if those guys got
together and played a game, or

00:31:07.715 --> 00:31:10.000
if there's a big game at a
convention, and you could just

00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:10.760
watch it live.

00:31:10.760 --> 00:31:11.120
That would be awesome.

00:31:11.120 --> 00:31:12.850
WILLIAM THOMPSON: So everybody's
writing comments

00:31:12.850 --> 00:31:17.210
on the post that can
feed into the DM.

00:31:17.210 --> 00:31:17.890
CHARLES:Yeah.

00:31:17.890 --> 00:31:19.850
FRASIER: That's great, writing
some of the ideas into the

00:31:19.850 --> 00:31:20.893
story, that's awesome.

00:31:20.893 --> 00:31:22.480
It's like a big hive-mind.

00:31:22.480 --> 00:31:23.371
CHARLES: Well that's what I was

00:31:23.371 --> 00:31:23.830
thinking, actually, Frasier.

00:31:23.830 --> 00:31:26.690
In that game that we're playing
in Arcane Apocalypse

00:31:26.690 --> 00:31:29.270
that when you open
your mind to--

00:31:29.270 --> 00:31:32.610
when you cast this magic spell
to scribe to see what's going

00:31:32.610 --> 00:31:34.370
on the world, we
could just pull

00:31:34.370 --> 00:31:35.620
stuff out of the comments.

00:31:38.540 --> 00:31:40.410
WILLIAM THOMPSON: Run an entire
Dungeon that's all

00:31:40.410 --> 00:31:41.800
freestyle from the comments?

00:31:41.800 --> 00:31:44.340
JOSHUA: Yes, sure, that
would be awesome.

00:31:44.340 --> 00:31:46.410
FRASIER: You have a shared
environment of people creating

00:31:46.410 --> 00:31:49.210
things ahead of time as you go,
and even the DM doesn't

00:31:49.210 --> 00:31:50.230
even know what's
going to go on.

00:31:50.230 --> 00:31:51.650
It's like improv.

00:31:51.650 --> 00:31:53.770
WILLIAM THOMPSON: Like, oh
my God, look at that.

00:31:53.770 --> 00:31:54.810
That'd be really fun.

00:31:54.810 --> 00:31:59.200
CHARLES: This elf is
coming towards you!

00:31:59.200 --> 00:32:01.320
WILLIAM THOMPSON: All right,
next question.

00:32:01.320 --> 00:32:03.150
JENNY MURPHY: Next question,
you've already alluded to this

00:32:03.150 --> 00:32:05.660
a little bit, especially when
you showed us the fog of war

00:32:05.660 --> 00:32:07.615
and mentioned a couple other
things you were planning to

00:32:07.615 --> 00:32:10.140
add, but where do you plan
to take this game?

00:32:10.140 --> 00:32:12.870
What are some interesting
things on your road map?

00:32:12.870 --> 00:32:16.980
JOSHUA: OK, so we do want to
integrate with some 3rd party

00:32:16.980 --> 00:32:17.990
sites using OAuth.

00:32:17.990 --> 00:32:21.150
So there's a popular campaign
management site out there

00:32:21.150 --> 00:32:24.560
called Obsidian Portal that does
allow OAuth to keep track

00:32:24.560 --> 00:32:26.450
of your notes and your
character sheets

00:32:26.450 --> 00:32:27.910
and stuff like that.

00:32:27.910 --> 00:32:30.060
So basically you'd be able to
pull that information in a

00:32:30.060 --> 00:32:34.360
hangout, so that between
hangouts you can have this is

00:32:34.360 --> 00:32:35.620
what happened since last time.

00:32:35.620 --> 00:32:38.320
This is our log of our
adventures, and not have to

00:32:38.320 --> 00:32:40.380
replicate all that functionality
within the

00:32:40.380 --> 00:32:42.520
hangout app itself.

00:32:42.520 --> 00:32:44.530
Yeah, Charles talked about
the fog of war.

00:32:44.530 --> 00:32:47.110
So we definitely want
some more advanced

00:32:47.110 --> 00:32:50.640
mapping type of features.

00:32:50.640 --> 00:32:52.620
We have to be careful, because
a lot of people want things

00:32:52.620 --> 00:32:55.350
like super advanced line
of vision and automatic

00:32:55.350 --> 00:32:57.480
calculating, distances
between objects.

00:32:57.480 --> 00:33:01.020
And while having a computer is
great to let you do stuff,

00:33:01.020 --> 00:33:02.570
that stuff is not on
the table top.

00:33:02.570 --> 00:33:04.630
So we have to walk a fine line
that we don't turn into

00:33:04.630 --> 00:33:08.720
computer game, and keep it close
to the actual playing

00:33:08.720 --> 00:33:10.942
game experience.

00:33:10.942 --> 00:33:15.050
CHARLES: And again, as I said
at the beginning, we're not

00:33:15.050 --> 00:33:16.490
developing for a game.

00:33:16.490 --> 00:33:19.500
We're developing for a
whole host of games.

00:33:19.500 --> 00:33:22.120
This is like building an
app for board games

00:33:22.120 --> 00:33:23.610
or card games, right.

00:33:23.610 --> 00:33:26.940
The more you make specific
things that work for specific

00:33:26.940 --> 00:33:29.650
games, the less time
you're spending on

00:33:29.650 --> 00:33:30.865
everybody else's game.

00:33:30.865 --> 00:33:34.610
So line of site is very
important for D&amp;D, but really

00:33:34.610 --> 00:33:38.280
irrelevant for things like a Ars
Magica or Apocalypse World

00:33:38.280 --> 00:33:41.950
that are abstract
combat in a way.

00:33:41.950 --> 00:33:45.400
We want to build things like
a deck of cards you

00:33:45.400 --> 00:33:46.310
can draw out of.

00:33:46.310 --> 00:33:50.630
A set of dice that you could
roll, random number generators

00:33:50.630 --> 00:33:54.270
that just cover things that
we have never thought of.

00:33:54.270 --> 00:33:59.400
For example, one game that I was
playing, when we came to a

00:33:59.400 --> 00:34:04.600
town, Greg Christopher who was
GMing would pick, randomly,

00:34:04.600 --> 00:34:09.389
two of the seven deadly sins
to define what kind of

00:34:09.389 --> 00:34:11.650
conflict was going
on in the town.

00:34:11.650 --> 00:34:13.709
And so he was like, OK well
I got pick a number

00:34:13.709 --> 00:34:14.830
between one and seven.

00:34:14.830 --> 00:34:17.469
I said just roll a
seven sided die.

00:34:17.469 --> 00:34:19.460
And I hadn't actually programmed
a seven sided die,

00:34:19.460 --> 00:34:23.920
but I built the RegEx so that it
could do any random number.

00:34:23.920 --> 00:34:27.520
So he goes, oh OK, 2D7,
boom, and it worked.

00:34:27.520 --> 00:34:30.870
And we want to have that kind
of flexibility, so that

00:34:30.870 --> 00:34:33.699
anybody can come in with any
game that we've never seen

00:34:33.699 --> 00:34:35.560
before, that we've never
played before, and

00:34:35.560 --> 00:34:35.960
it works for them.

00:34:35.960 --> 00:34:39.580
FRASIER: I mean right now you
could go and create a map

00:34:39.580 --> 00:34:43.750
that's a chessboard, you could
upload a bunch of the tokens

00:34:43.750 --> 00:34:47.790
that are the pieces, and you
could almost out of the box

00:34:47.790 --> 00:34:52.010
have a game of chess with
somebody, right, with no real

00:34:52.010 --> 00:34:53.724
modifications even to
the environment.

00:34:53.724 --> 00:34:56.694
I mean as long as you have the
picture of the chess board and

00:34:56.694 --> 00:34:58.750
the right tokens for pieces,
then you got

00:34:58.750 --> 00:35:00.110
yourself a chess game.

00:35:00.110 --> 00:35:03.437
Yes, when I go to the bathroom,
Charles could be

00:35:03.437 --> 00:35:07.710
moving pieces around,
but it's all that's

00:35:07.710 --> 00:35:09.015
all possible, right?

00:35:09.015 --> 00:35:10.040
CHARLES: How did you
get four queens?

00:35:10.040 --> 00:35:12.320
I don't remember that.

00:35:12.320 --> 00:35:15.690
Well that's the compromise
between

00:35:15.690 --> 00:35:16.790
flexibility and security.

00:35:16.790 --> 00:35:19.750
And it's not necessarily a
technical issue always.

00:35:19.750 --> 00:35:22.080
Some of it is just that you want
to leave it open ended.

00:35:22.080 --> 00:35:24.710
So sure you, can cheat and
move your pawns back when

00:35:24.710 --> 00:35:25.960
somebody's in the bathroom.

00:35:30.130 --> 00:35:32.910
So that's the downside, but the
upside is that you could

00:35:32.910 --> 00:35:36.400
take this RPG game and turn it
into a chess board, or a

00:35:36.400 --> 00:35:36.840
checkers board.

00:35:36.840 --> 00:35:39.070
Or you could play Backgammon
on it, in theory.

00:35:39.070 --> 00:35:41.370
You could play pretty much any
game you wanted, but you're

00:35:41.370 --> 00:35:45.887
not going to have the rules
programmed in preventing you

00:35:45.887 --> 00:35:48.102
from cheating.

00:35:48.102 --> 00:35:50.730
So it's a compromise.

00:35:50.730 --> 00:35:52.950
I think one of the other things
Josh and I were talking

00:35:52.950 --> 00:35:56.920
about is that at some point,
this is going to get to level

00:35:56.920 --> 00:36:00.060
of wanting to do a Kickstarter
around it.

00:36:00.060 --> 00:36:05.380
And get some design people
in and really get all the

00:36:05.380 --> 00:36:08.593
functionality that we want,
organize it all, put it out to

00:36:08.593 --> 00:36:11.150
the community, and see
who's willing to

00:36:11.150 --> 00:36:13.120
kick in a couple bucks.

00:36:13.120 --> 00:36:16.100
Because we're not making
any money off of this.

00:36:16.100 --> 00:36:18.990
I certainly started building
this, because my Ars Magica

00:36:18.990 --> 00:36:22.520
game, which was in Frasier's
living room actually, fell

00:36:22.520 --> 00:36:24.920
apart because we lived in a town
of 30,000, and I think

00:36:24.920 --> 00:36:28.630
there's seven gamers and
we were three of them.

00:36:28.630 --> 00:36:32.310
The moment we came online we
found 20,000 other people that

00:36:32.310 --> 00:36:35.490
we can play with, and there
was always somebody free.

00:36:35.490 --> 00:36:38.830
And so I built this so I could
continue my games.

00:36:38.830 --> 00:36:41.585
And I'm happy to share it
with everybody else.

00:36:41.585 --> 00:36:42.920
JENNY MURPHY: Great.

00:36:42.920 --> 00:36:46.040
So we actually have a question
from the comment stream.

00:36:46.040 --> 00:36:48.280
Christian asks, are you
planning to include

00:36:48.280 --> 00:36:51.640
functionality for saving
log as other assets.

00:36:51.640 --> 00:36:54.460
For example, the Google Docs
or Google Drive or possibly

00:36:54.460 --> 00:36:56.285
pulling a content from there?

00:36:56.285 --> 00:37:00.250
JOSHUA: Yes, so in early alpha
versions of the app, we

00:37:00.250 --> 00:37:02.770
actually were saving stuff to
Google App Engine in a data

00:37:02.770 --> 00:37:06.970
store and pulling that back in
to, basically, as you join the

00:37:06.970 --> 00:37:08.750
hangout, you could choose
a previous session.

00:37:08.750 --> 00:37:12.440
And whatever map state it was,
or where the tokens where, all

00:37:12.440 --> 00:37:16.740
that would get replayed
at the current state.

00:37:16.740 --> 00:37:19.310
And that's almost ready
for this version.

00:37:19.310 --> 00:37:23.540
It's just that when we went from
alpha to beta-- but it's

00:37:23.540 --> 00:37:25.130
still really kind of alpha--

00:37:25.130 --> 00:37:27.110
we redid the whole
engine of how we

00:37:27.110 --> 00:37:28.390
stored those JSON objects.

00:37:28.390 --> 00:37:32.180
So we have to rewrite the code
to sync that to App Engine, or

00:37:32.180 --> 00:37:33.530
we might do MySQL database.

00:37:33.530 --> 00:37:34.650
It really doesn't matter
on the back

00:37:34.650 --> 00:37:37.032
end, but that is coming.

00:37:37.032 --> 00:37:38.700
CHARLES: I was doing
my own MySQL.

00:37:38.700 --> 00:37:41.650
There's also Obsidian Portal
that Josh eluded to earlier

00:37:41.650 --> 00:37:43.630
that really does that.

00:37:43.630 --> 00:37:45.580
It's a site where you can
create a wiki for your

00:37:45.580 --> 00:37:48.250
campaign, and you can
make, essentially a

00:37:48.250 --> 00:37:49.480
blog for your campaign.

00:37:49.480 --> 00:37:52.890
So we could be writing sessions
back to that for

00:37:52.890 --> 00:37:54.280
people who use that.

00:37:54.280 --> 00:37:57.480
It's a question of finding the
best way to do it, finding a

00:37:57.480 --> 00:37:58.460
giant data store.

00:37:58.460 --> 00:38:01.230
One way that I've been
considering doing it is

00:38:01.230 --> 00:38:04.250
something like Dropbox or Google
Docs, where you could

00:38:04.250 --> 00:38:05.850
just go in preload.

00:38:05.850 --> 00:38:07.700
You do all your maps, you
do your tokens, and your

00:38:07.700 --> 00:38:08.835
pictures, and so on,
and so forth.

00:38:08.835 --> 00:38:11.630
And you just drop them
into a Dropbox.

00:38:11.630 --> 00:38:16.110
And then when you're in the
game, you have a tool window

00:38:16.110 --> 00:38:18.340
where you could just go and
click, click, click, click,

00:38:18.340 --> 00:38:20.820
and load up your images directly
from your shared

00:38:20.820 --> 00:38:22.920
folder somewhere.

00:38:22.920 --> 00:38:25.150
That's the best way to do that,
we haven't figured that

00:38:25.150 --> 00:38:25.940
technically yet.

00:38:25.940 --> 00:38:27.200
FRASIER: Yeah, and when that
used to exist in the

00:38:27.200 --> 00:38:29.290
functionality, it was pretty
great, because then we could

00:38:29.290 --> 00:38:30.890
quickly review what happened
last week.

00:38:30.890 --> 00:38:33.150
I don't know if you've ever
played, and you don't remember

00:38:33.150 --> 00:38:36.300
the names of people that you
meet and things like that.

00:38:36.300 --> 00:38:39.780
There was a certain continuity
that you could go back and go,

00:38:39.780 --> 00:38:42.270
who was that person that I
stabbed in the back again?

00:38:42.270 --> 00:38:46.950
Oh right, because you'll write
down notes as you do it.

00:38:46.950 --> 00:38:49.175
Fraser stabs Charles
in the back.

00:38:51.800 --> 00:38:54.520
CHARLES: It's basically a search
of a Twitter stream

00:38:54.520 --> 00:38:56.320
that we all contributed to.

00:38:56.320 --> 00:38:58.260
FRASIER: Yeah, and hash tags
and things like that, so I

00:38:58.260 --> 00:39:01.870
that all was very cool,
and it would be great

00:39:01.870 --> 00:39:04.490
to have that back.

00:39:04.490 --> 00:39:08.170
CHARLES: That's part of the
whole merging my work with

00:39:08.170 --> 00:39:12.708
Josh is, which is an
ongoing process.

00:39:12.708 --> 00:39:14.230
WILLIAM THOMPSON: I
had a question.

00:39:14.230 --> 00:39:18.460
The 1D7 is an example of
something you can do in

00:39:18.460 --> 00:39:21.380
virtual space that you can't
do in real life.

00:39:21.380 --> 00:39:22.830
It's a better than being
there moment.

00:39:22.830 --> 00:39:26.500
Do you have another
one of those?

00:39:26.500 --> 00:39:30.495
Just something that happened
that's unique?

00:39:30.495 --> 00:39:32.660
CHARLES: Yeah, there's a game
called Mouse Guard that's

00:39:32.660 --> 00:39:34.290
based on a comic book.

00:39:34.290 --> 00:39:37.980
And the role playing game was
written by Luke Crane.

00:39:37.980 --> 00:39:41.770
So it's built on his burning
wheel system.

00:39:41.770 --> 00:39:47.850
And instead of having one big
die, a 20-sided of die or

00:39:47.850 --> 00:39:50.390
12-sided die, you have a whole
bunch of, basically, coin

00:39:50.390 --> 00:39:52.500
flips, 2-sided dice.

00:39:52.500 --> 00:39:57.240
And you can't up the number that
were successes versus the

00:39:57.240 --> 00:39:58.680
number that were failures.

00:39:58.680 --> 00:40:00.940
So it's a D2 basically.

00:40:00.940 --> 00:40:02.740
It's a coin which is a D2.

00:40:02.740 --> 00:40:06.125
And on the table, what you do
is, you normally don't carry a

00:40:06.125 --> 00:40:07.080
bunch of coins to the table.

00:40:07.080 --> 00:40:10.700
You roll D6s, and one, two,
three, counts as a failure,

00:40:10.700 --> 00:40:12.820
and four, five, six, counts
as-- so it's a hack.

00:40:12.820 --> 00:40:15.310
The dice version is a hack.

00:40:15.310 --> 00:40:20.023
In Hangouts you just roll D2s,
and it works perfectly.

00:40:20.023 --> 00:40:22.010
WILLIAM THOMPSON: Yeah, you can
roll arbitrary numbers.

00:40:22.010 --> 00:40:23.975
Yeah, I remember with the Star
Wars role playing game, you

00:40:23.975 --> 00:40:26.482
always ended up with giant
fistfuls of dice, and it would

00:40:26.482 --> 00:40:28.790
take us forever just
to add them all up.

00:40:28.790 --> 00:40:31.370
And so, that's a cool point.

00:40:31.370 --> 00:40:35.382
JOSHUA: Yeah, we actually do
support what, for those kinds

00:40:35.382 --> 00:40:37.540
of systems, a lot of times
you're comparing them to a

00:40:37.540 --> 00:40:38.250
target number.

00:40:38.250 --> 00:40:41.210
So I'm rolling 10 dice, and
anything bigger than a four

00:40:41.210 --> 00:40:42.710
counts as a success.

00:40:42.710 --> 00:40:46.452
So our syntax does, you can do
10D6 greater than or equal to

00:40:46.452 --> 00:40:48.950
four, and then anything that
was a rolled greater than a

00:40:48.950 --> 00:40:51.200
four, it highlights and then
counts those successes for you

00:40:51.200 --> 00:40:51.790
automatically.

00:40:51.790 --> 00:40:53.120
So it saves you a little
bit of time.

00:40:53.120 --> 00:40:53.540
FRASIER: I mean it's
that same thing.

00:40:53.540 --> 00:40:59.490
If you've ever played Catan or
Carcassonne or things like

00:40:59.490 --> 00:41:01.660
that, but on your iPhone
or your iPad

00:41:01.660 --> 00:41:02.760
and things like that.

00:41:02.760 --> 00:41:07.030
And it's just like you can burn
through games in minutes.

00:41:07.030 --> 00:41:09.760
You play a game of Catan, and
you're done in 20 minutes,

00:41:09.760 --> 00:41:11.450
when normally a bunch of people
sitting around a room,

00:41:11.450 --> 00:41:13.430
it's going to take you five
hours to get through a game.

00:41:13.430 --> 00:41:16.370
It's just because all of the
mechanics is all just getting

00:41:16.370 --> 00:41:17.170
done so quickly.

00:41:17.170 --> 00:41:21.180
The game is getting set up, the
dice are being rolled, and

00:41:21.180 --> 00:41:22.550
it feels very similar to that.

00:41:22.550 --> 00:41:25.260
Which is all of that it, roll
the dice, oops it fell on the

00:41:25.260 --> 00:41:27.810
table, oops, got to pick
it back up again.

00:41:27.810 --> 00:41:31.020
Is that cocked, is it not?

00:41:31.020 --> 00:41:33.640
That all is just like boom,
dice get rolled

00:41:33.640 --> 00:41:35.730
really fast. It's good.

00:41:35.730 --> 00:41:38.480
That part has really smoothed
out the game play so much.

00:41:38.480 --> 00:41:41.530
And like what you're saying,
those the games where you've

00:41:41.530 --> 00:41:43.450
just got these great big fist
fulls of dice, you got to add

00:41:43.450 --> 00:41:45.820
them all up and you've got to
add all those modifiers, and

00:41:45.820 --> 00:41:47.795
this is so much better.

00:41:47.795 --> 00:41:51.100
CHARLES: And the user ability
and the user interface and

00:41:51.100 --> 00:41:53.975
making sure that those things
happen quickly and smoothly,

00:41:53.975 --> 00:41:57.600
that's going to be a big part of
our project going forward.

00:41:57.600 --> 00:41:59.820
And I think that when we get to
the Kickstarter, certainly

00:41:59.820 --> 00:42:02.280
that's going to be a big
priority for me, anyways.

00:42:02.280 --> 00:42:05.600
As the GM, you end up spending
a lot of time uploading a new

00:42:05.600 --> 00:42:08.846
map, or where do I put
that thing, oh I got

00:42:08.846 --> 00:42:10.040
to scale that properly.

00:42:10.040 --> 00:42:12.090
If you could do all that before
the game, and just dump

00:42:12.090 --> 00:42:16.170
it somewhere, and then be able
to click, click, click, and

00:42:16.170 --> 00:42:17.380
pull it in, push it out.

00:42:17.380 --> 00:42:19.810
That will make the game so much
easier for everybody.

00:42:19.810 --> 00:42:22.405
Fog of war, OK, I'll put my map
up, but I don't have to

00:42:22.405 --> 00:42:23.947
worry that you guys are going
to see thing that you can't

00:42:23.947 --> 00:42:24.860
see, because I'll just
block it out.

00:42:24.860 --> 00:42:28.800
FRASIER: And I think that's
really the fundamental

00:42:28.800 --> 00:42:31.640
philosophy that's driving the
whole process, as we mentioned

00:42:31.640 --> 00:42:34.910
before, which is start from
maintaining that core

00:42:34.910 --> 00:42:38.205
essential game experience that
you play with your friends,

00:42:38.205 --> 00:42:42.700
that you hang out, that it's
all interacting and social,

00:42:42.700 --> 00:42:47.440
and then support and remove
all of the scutt work, the

00:42:47.440 --> 00:42:50.200
things you don't really enjoy
doing as you play your game.

00:42:50.200 --> 00:42:52.270
So you can get at the essential,
which is the shared

00:42:52.270 --> 00:42:53.360
experience.

00:42:53.360 --> 00:42:57.870
The rules of the games often
get in the way of the play.

00:42:57.870 --> 00:43:00.970
But in many cases they're
necessity, and so all of the

00:43:00.970 --> 00:43:03.380
things that arr hard and slow
and complicated, we can get

00:43:03.380 --> 00:43:04.150
that out of the way.

00:43:04.150 --> 00:43:05.772
We ca just have a
really fun game.

00:43:05.772 --> 00:43:07.008
JENNY MURPHY: Great.

00:43:07.008 --> 00:43:09.570
Well believe it or not, we're
actually running out of time.

00:43:09.570 --> 00:43:11.700
45 minutes flew by.

00:43:11.700 --> 00:43:14.570
So does anyone have any closing
comments or thoughts

00:43:14.570 --> 00:43:15.390
they'd like to add
before we close?

00:43:15.390 --> 00:43:18.895
FRASIER: What was your first
game that you played?

00:43:18.895 --> 00:43:20.530
WILLIAM THOMPSON: We were just
talking about this before we

00:43:20.530 --> 00:43:22.650
got started.

00:43:22.650 --> 00:43:27.975
The first role playing was
actually the old blue Advanced

00:43:27.975 --> 00:43:31.670
D&amp;D box set, it was this
was the one after the

00:43:31.670 --> 00:43:32.590
three little books.

00:43:32.590 --> 00:43:34.320
I have that one as
my first one.

00:43:34.320 --> 00:43:35.695
FRASIER: That was the right?

00:43:35.695 --> 00:43:37.770
It was the expert set.

00:43:37.770 --> 00:43:39.970
WILLIAM THOMPSON: The expert or
something, and you started

00:43:39.970 --> 00:43:42.460
with The Keep on the
Borderlands,

00:43:42.460 --> 00:43:43.960
was the first one.

00:43:43.960 --> 00:43:46.550
And then after that, we did
a whole bunch of things.

00:43:46.550 --> 00:43:49.800
I ended up playing
tons of Mirth in

00:43:49.800 --> 00:43:51.960
Middle Earth role playing.

00:43:51.960 --> 00:43:55.070
And then we added the spell
caster rules to it, because we

00:43:55.070 --> 00:43:57.490
wanted better spells and
better criticals.

00:43:57.490 --> 00:44:00.540
And then we got into
Twilight 2000.

00:44:00.540 --> 00:44:04.170
It was a lot of riding around
in Eastern Europe in planes,

00:44:04.170 --> 00:44:05.290
shooting at bad guys.

00:44:05.290 --> 00:44:06.550
It was great.

00:44:06.550 --> 00:44:09.780
I think that was when I finally
had an encyclopedic

00:44:09.780 --> 00:44:12.788
knowledge of firearms.

00:44:12.788 --> 00:44:15.255
Ad unfortunately it stops in
high school because I stopped

00:44:15.255 --> 00:44:17.750
playing Twilight 2000, and
moved on to other stuff.

00:44:17.750 --> 00:44:24.280
I have all weapons
before like 1993.

00:44:24.280 --> 00:44:28.254
JONATHAN BERRY: This is a skill
I hope to use one day.

00:44:28.254 --> 00:44:29.710
JENNY MURPHY: We'll finish
our time machine,

00:44:29.710 --> 00:44:30.910
and go back to 1993.

00:44:30.910 --> 00:44:32.640
WILLIAM THOMPSON: Yes
I'm ready for the

00:44:32.640 --> 00:44:36.330
apocalypse in 1993.

00:44:36.330 --> 00:44:40.270
And more recently we've been
playing the rebuild of Gamma

00:44:40.270 --> 00:44:43.150
World which is fairly nuts.

00:44:43.150 --> 00:44:45.210
I remember playing the original
Gamma World, and it

00:44:45.210 --> 00:44:46.905
was crazy, but it was sort
of serious crazy .

00:44:46.905 --> 00:44:50.300
And the new Gamma World
is just crazy.

00:44:50.300 --> 00:44:53.234
It's a lot of fun.

00:44:53.234 --> 00:44:54.240
JENNY MURPHY: Nothing?

00:44:54.240 --> 00:44:57.410
JONATHAN BERRY: I'm going
to pass on this one.

00:44:57.410 --> 00:44:59.880
FRASIER: We can't suck
you into a game then?

00:44:59.880 --> 00:45:01.760
JONATHAN BERRY: Most of my role
playing experience has

00:45:01.760 --> 00:45:05.010
actually been in the last
year working at Google.

00:45:05.010 --> 00:45:06.400
JENNY MURPHY: Funny how that
happens, isn't it?

00:45:06.400 --> 00:45:07.390
JONATHAN BERRY: Yeah.

00:45:07.390 --> 00:45:08.980
JENNY MURPHY: I'm also
pretty casual myself.

00:45:08.980 --> 00:45:10.950
So you'll usually
find me playing

00:45:10.950 --> 00:45:13.100
Carcassonne or Settlers.

00:45:13.100 --> 00:45:15.830
But occasionally, especially if
I'm at a gaming con, or I'm

00:45:15.830 --> 00:45:19.337
with some friends who are more
into it, I'll definitely pick

00:45:19.337 --> 00:45:20.080
up the dice.

00:45:20.080 --> 00:45:22.575
And I've played a lot of fifth
edition and some fourth

00:45:22.575 --> 00:45:22.884
edition, I believe.

00:45:22.884 --> 00:45:25.890
WILLIAM THOMPSON: Actually, and
the other thing we used to

00:45:25.890 --> 00:45:27.740
play is Call of Cthulhu.

00:45:27.740 --> 00:45:28.350
FRASIER: Awesome.

00:45:28.350 --> 00:45:32.240
WILLIAM THOMPSON: That was how
we dragged our girlfriends

00:45:32.240 --> 00:45:33.590
into playing role
playing games.

00:45:33.590 --> 00:45:35.570
FRASIER: And that's actually the
game we've been thinking

00:45:35.570 --> 00:45:40.010
would be a really good intro
public game, because it's

00:45:40.010 --> 00:45:43.900
horror, the rules are really
simple, there's a lot of stuff

00:45:43.900 --> 00:45:45.735
there that a lot of people
would really enjoy.

00:45:45.735 --> 00:45:47.905
And you could genuinely
freak out the players

00:45:47.905 --> 00:45:49.350
if you did it right.

00:45:49.350 --> 00:45:51.730
WILLIAM THOMPSON: It was
all about atmosphere

00:45:51.730 --> 00:45:51.960
when you play it.

00:45:51.960 --> 00:45:56.050
We'd turn the lights low, we'd
light some candles, and we had

00:45:56.050 --> 00:45:58.520
some friends that were pretty
good at chanting strange

00:45:58.520 --> 00:45:59.770
[UNINTELLIGIBLE].

00:46:02.505 --> 00:46:05.630
JENNY MURPHY: Cool, okey doke.

00:46:05.630 --> 00:46:08.220
So we are actually completely
out of time now.

00:46:08.220 --> 00:46:09.740
So we're going to
call it a week.

00:46:09.740 --> 00:46:11.000
Thank so much for joining us.

00:46:11.000 --> 00:46:11.740
WILLIAM THOMPSON: Absolutely,
and this is a

00:46:11.740 --> 00:46:12.930
totally awesome project.

00:46:12.930 --> 00:46:14.530
JENNY MURPHY: Yes, and we'll
be following this very

00:46:14.530 --> 00:46:17.120
closely, and maybe you guys
would like to join us again in

00:46:17.120 --> 00:46:18.000
the future.

00:46:18.000 --> 00:46:20.940
CHARLES: Yes, six months
from now it'll be

00:46:20.940 --> 00:46:23.830
unrecognizable, hopefully.

00:46:23.830 --> 00:46:27.540
JENNY MURPHY: Hopefully
in a good way.

00:46:27.540 --> 00:46:28.830
OK, well thanks again.

00:46:28.830 --> 00:46:31.140
CHARLES: Thank you!

00:46:31.140 --> 00:46:32.950
WILLIAM THOMPSON: We'll see you
whenever we do this again.

00:46:32.950 --> 00:46:33.800
JENNY MURPHY: In a couple
of weeks we'll be

00:46:33.800 --> 00:46:35.080
doing another session.

00:46:35.080 --> 00:46:37.490
So, all of you, we'll see you
in a couple of weeks.

00:46:37.490 --> 00:46:38.590
Bye!

00:46:38.590 --> 00:46:39.840
CHARLES: All right, bye.
