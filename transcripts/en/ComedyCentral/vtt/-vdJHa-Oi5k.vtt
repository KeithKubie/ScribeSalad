just take him to rehab,
just right away.

00:00:10.443 --> 00:00:13.012
Just take him--if anyone wants
to start a ska band today,

00:00:13.012 --> 00:00:17.950
fucking take them to rehab.
Bad time.

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:15.241
And I love the idea that--

00:01:15.241 --> 00:01:18.510
that you have an experience
where you're like,

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:20.079
"This is not happening, right?"

00:01:20.079 --> 00:01:21.447
Like, just, "This is fucked up."

00:01:21.447 --> 00:01:23.950
You know, we all have
those stories.

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:25.118
I mean, I have a--
I have a ton of them.

00:01:25.118 --> 00:01:26.518
One I'm not telling today,

00:01:26.518 --> 00:01:29.956
I saw the penis of the drummer
from Meta--

00:01:29.956 --> 00:01:30.957
like at a show.

00:01:30.957 --> 00:01:32.291
That's not happ--No.

00:01:32.291 --> 00:01:33.927
I mean, like you can't
wrap your head

00:01:33.927 --> 00:01:36.262
or anything around it;
it's huge.

00:01:38.264 --> 00:01:41.201
But also, sometimes you forget
that you're the thing

00:01:41.201 --> 00:01:43.269
that's happening
to somebody else.

00:01:43.269 --> 00:01:45.771
Like, you're the fucking "oh,
my God, this is not happening."

00:01:45.771 --> 00:01:49.475
Like, you're the event that
somebody goes, "Fuck...

00:01:49.475 --> 00:01:50.476
You."

00:01:50.476 --> 00:01:52.611
So I would like
to tell you a story

00:01:52.611 --> 00:01:54.113
that has both of those elements,

00:01:54.113 --> 00:01:55.815
uh, and it involves my sobriety,

00:01:55.815 --> 00:01:58.150
which I have today,

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:01.387
uh, and I've had since 1996,

00:02:01.387 --> 00:02:03.122
except for the two times
that I got high, which--

00:02:03.122 --> 00:02:04.723
So that--
that means not since 19--

00:02:04.723 --> 00:02:07.126
so I broke it,
but that's 'cause the--

00:02:07.126 --> 00:02:08.160
that's not the rules.

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.163
So you don't get to just leave.

00:02:10.163 --> 00:02:12.231
Well, you can, and I have.

00:02:12.231 --> 00:02:14.066
But one time,
it was my decision,

00:02:14.066 --> 00:02:17.003
and the other time,
it was also my decision.

00:02:17.003 --> 00:02:20.139
So the--the first story--

00:02:20.139 --> 00:02:21.340
the first story is this one.

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:24.844
So my wife and I, uh,
we had a, uh,

00:02:24.844 --> 00:02:27.179
a 19-year-old dog, okay?

00:02:27.179 --> 00:02:29.482
Fucking 19-year-old
German Shepherd.

00:02:29.482 --> 00:02:31.016
That is fucking old.

00:02:31.016 --> 00:02:32.317
Like, that is--that's done.

00:02:32.317 --> 00:02:33.652
Like, that dog is fucking done.

00:02:33.652 --> 00:02:35.854
Like, it literally just
sat in the corner

00:02:35.854 --> 00:02:38.691
of a room, it was like
a fucking pillow

00:02:38.691 --> 00:02:40.426
with bones in it and a head.

00:02:40.426 --> 00:02:42.161
It just sat there.

00:02:42.161 --> 00:02:43.863
Like, the dog wanted
to be done.

00:02:43.863 --> 00:02:46.532
Do you understand? Like, it was
just being kept alive on pills.

00:02:46.532 --> 00:02:48.201
That's it--we just
gave it pills

00:02:48.201 --> 00:02:49.769
to fucking keep it alive.

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:51.003
And you know, they're fuck--
they don't--

00:02:51.003 --> 00:02:52.538
you know, they're not--

00:02:52.538 --> 00:02:53.939
well, they are dumb,
but they're not that dumb.

00:02:53.939 --> 00:02:55.007
You know what I mean?

00:02:55.007 --> 00:02:56.442
Like, the dog was just, like--

00:02:56.442 --> 00:02:57.877
you could just tell--
it was like, "Fuck, dude.

00:02:57.877 --> 00:02:59.445
"Haven't we done this?

00:02:59.445 --> 00:03:01.214
"Haven't I dogged
the shit out of it?

00:03:01.214 --> 00:03:03.349
"What the fuck do you want
from me?

00:03:03.349 --> 00:03:05.684
"Fuck, I got the ball.
Remember that?

00:03:05.684 --> 00:03:08.387
"I got it a bunch of times,
as I recall,

00:03:08.387 --> 00:03:10.189
"and I fucking shit
on the carpet

00:03:10.189 --> 00:03:11.891
"and ruined that whole fucking
birthday party thing,

00:03:11.891 --> 00:03:13.793
"and then I took a picture
for your fucking Instagram.

00:03:13.793 --> 00:03:16.729
Please. What the fuck more do
you want from me?" Right?

00:03:16.729 --> 00:03:18.730
But you don't kill it
'cause it's a dog.

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:20.032
So like, here, take these pills.

00:03:20.032 --> 00:03:21.400
We just gave it a lot of pills,
right?

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:23.569
So anyway, we had this dog
and it was very old

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:26.405
and it was being kept alive
on pills.

00:03:26.405 --> 00:03:28.641
So, uh, uh--and
I didn't know what the pill--

00:03:28.641 --> 00:03:30.709
I didn't pay any attention
what the pills were.

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:32.211
I mean, I had--there was one--

00:03:32.211 --> 00:03:33.713
that dog had no moves left,
right?

00:03:33.713 --> 00:03:36.081
Except for that they--
except it would fart. Right?

00:03:36.081 --> 00:03:37.417
It'd just go, "Oh."
You know what I mean?

00:03:37.417 --> 00:03:38.918
But their butt holes
are all worked out

00:03:38.918 --> 00:03:40.719
so it just--you don't even know
it's happened.

00:03:40.719 --> 00:03:42.255
You know, their butt holes
are all loose.

00:03:42.255 --> 00:03:43.722
So it's just "Ooh."
It just comes out.

00:03:43.722 --> 00:03:46.259
It's like a cloud.
Like, "Ooh."

00:03:46.259 --> 00:03:48.427
Like, it just, "Ooh."
It's just like ghost farts.

00:03:48.427 --> 00:03:50.930
It's just a whistle,
like you don't know it's there

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:53.933
until you know it's there,
and then you're fucking pissed.

00:03:53.933 --> 00:03:56.102
'Cause dog farts are like--

00:03:56.102 --> 00:03:57.769
like, you know how some smells,
you go, "Ugh!"

00:03:57.769 --> 00:03:59.272
But dog farts make you pissed.

00:03:59.272 --> 00:04:00.906
Like, you're like, "Fuck!

00:04:00.906 --> 00:04:02.908
"What the fuck is this?

00:04:02.908 --> 00:04:05.777
"Jesus Christ!
Good god.

00:04:05.777 --> 00:04:10.083
What the fuck's wrong with you?"

00:04:10.083 --> 00:04:11.851
So anyway, uh,

00:04:11.851 --> 00:04:13.452
there was one Christmas.

00:04:13.452 --> 00:04:15.121
Uh, I love Christmas.
I fucking love it.

00:04:15.121 --> 00:04:17.523
I like Christmas so much, I'm
gonna make you fucking hate it.

00:04:17.523 --> 00:04:19.759
That's how much I like it.
I'm that guy.

00:04:19.759 --> 00:04:21.594
I like it so much,
I ruin it for my whole family,

00:04:21.594 --> 00:04:22.962
which is fucked up
'cause I have kids.

00:04:22.962 --> 00:04:25.531
Anyway, so I have that.

00:04:25.531 --> 00:04:29.368
It's Christmas, and uh,
I'm overexcited about it,

00:04:29.368 --> 00:04:32.271
and I'm also depressed,
uh, because I have depression

00:04:32.271 --> 00:04:34.106
and anxiety,
which I'm not aware of.

00:04:34.106 --> 00:04:36.108
And also, there was a sweater
I wanted

00:04:36.108 --> 00:04:37.976
and I'm not fucking getting it.

00:04:37.976 --> 00:04:40.313
Like, even when my wife said,
"You're not getting it,"

00:04:40.313 --> 00:04:41.780
I'm like, "Like,
in a surprise way?

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:43.382
Or I'm not fucking getting it?"

00:04:43.382 --> 00:04:44.984
And not in a surprise way.

00:04:44.984 --> 00:04:46.619
And then she's like,
"It should be about the kids."

00:04:46.619 --> 00:04:48.954
Fuck you.
I dog-eared the catalog.

00:04:48.954 --> 00:04:50.456
And then she's like, "I don't
even know what a catalog is

00:04:50.456 --> 00:04:51.958
'cause I live in the now."

00:04:51.958 --> 00:04:54.226
The point is,

00:04:54.226 --> 00:04:56.228
I was very upset,

00:04:56.228 --> 00:04:58.331
and it was Christmas Eve
and I was sort of--

00:04:58.331 --> 00:05:00.299
I was having a panic attack
and feeling shitty,

00:05:00.299 --> 00:05:01.833
and not to get too dark,

00:05:01.833 --> 00:05:03.469
but I was feeling, uh, suicidal.

00:05:03.469 --> 00:05:05.737
I was struggling with
some mental health issues

00:05:05.737 --> 00:05:07.807
that I didn't know that I had,
and anxiety,

00:05:07.807 --> 00:05:10.343
and, um, uh,
and then all of a sudden,

00:05:10.343 --> 00:05:12.144
I remembered that one day,

00:05:12.144 --> 00:05:13.312
when my friend was in the house,

00:05:13.312 --> 00:05:15.180
he had walked past
the dog pills,

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:16.848
and he had noticed

00:05:16.848 --> 00:05:18.817
that one of the jars of pills

00:05:18.817 --> 00:05:20.652
was like, "Oh, my--oh, fuck,
you have those."

00:05:20.652 --> 00:05:22.321
You know what I mean?
He didn't say what they were,

00:05:22.321 --> 00:05:23.589
but he made a face that went,
"That's good."

00:05:23.589 --> 00:05:25.357
Like, there's something
in those pills

00:05:25.357 --> 00:05:27.327
that might be something

00:05:27.327 --> 00:05:29.194
a depressed person should take
on Christmas Eve.

00:05:29.194 --> 00:05:31.363
So there were two jugs of--

00:05:31.363 --> 00:05:33.532
and dog pills come in, like,
little, tiny jugs,

00:05:33.532 --> 00:05:36.201
like tankards,
not the tall orange ones.

00:05:36.201 --> 00:05:38.004
So thanks for clearing that up,
Greg.

00:05:38.004 --> 00:05:39.038
You're welcome.

00:05:39.038 --> 00:05:41.040
I walk past the dog pills.

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:42.841
I remember that one of them is
potent, apparently,

00:05:42.841 --> 00:05:44.544
and I'm not sure which,
'cause I also know

00:05:44.544 --> 00:05:46.178
the other one's
for the butt hole.

00:05:46.178 --> 00:05:47.513
So I don't want to take--

00:05:47.513 --> 00:05:49.048
I don't want to take
the wrong one.

00:05:49.048 --> 00:05:50.515
My butt hole's tight and--
you know what I mean?

00:05:50.515 --> 00:05:52.385
I don't need a fucking really--

00:05:52.385 --> 00:05:54.354
My sphincter's good enough.
I don't need to really--

00:05:54.354 --> 00:05:55.722
You know what I mean?
It's for a dog that has--

00:05:55.722 --> 00:05:58.891
Anyway, so...

00:05:58.891 --> 00:06:01.527
Then there's a--there's a--
there's a--there--

00:06:01.527 --> 00:06:03.796
on one of the jugs,
there's the sleepy-faced guy.

00:06:03.796 --> 00:06:06.064
Do you know the sleepy-faced guy
on the pills?

00:06:06.064 --> 00:06:07.733
Right, he's like--he's got,
like, a nose,

00:06:07.733 --> 00:06:09.702
and then he's like, "Oh."
He's so tired

00:06:09.702 --> 00:06:11.370
'cause he's taking these pills
and he's not allowed

00:06:11.370 --> 00:06:12.738
to operate machinery.

00:06:12.738 --> 00:06:14.539
Do you know what
I'm talking about? That guy.

00:06:14.539 --> 00:06:16.475
If that guy's on a jar of pills,
fucking ta--

00:06:16.475 --> 00:06:17.743
if you want to party,
but don't--

00:06:17.743 --> 00:06:19.211
I'm saying no to drugs.

00:06:19.211 --> 00:06:21.147
But if you're depressed
and you don't know any better,

00:06:21.147 --> 00:06:22.548
that's the one you go for.

00:06:22.548 --> 00:06:24.249
And also,
but why would a dog's pills

00:06:24.249 --> 00:06:25.585
have a sleeping--what did they--

00:06:25.585 --> 00:06:27.052
what is it they have to stay
awake for?

00:06:27.052 --> 00:06:28.320
Do you know what I mean?

00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:30.389
If your dog's operating
any machinery,

00:06:30.389 --> 00:06:32.891
you don't understand pets
at all.

00:06:32.891 --> 00:06:34.894
Or you're missing
a really fucking good

00:06:34.894 --> 00:06:37.429
financial opportunity,
'cause fuck.

00:06:37.429 --> 00:06:39.331
Your dog can drive a forklift.

00:06:39.331 --> 00:06:41.767
So I take one of the pills.

00:06:41.767 --> 00:06:44.570
I'm not really sure what it is,
but I take one of the pills.

00:06:44.570 --> 00:06:46.405
And then I read the j--
and I--and it fucking--

00:06:46.405 --> 00:06:48.274
it's like a sweater
for your insides.

00:06:48.274 --> 00:06:50.242
It's magical.
It levels me out.

00:06:50.242 --> 00:06:52.178
I'm like, oh, my God.
This is amazing.

00:06:52.178 --> 00:06:53.946
Something called
hydrocodone, right?

00:06:53.946 --> 00:06:55.614
And I--and as an alcoholic,
I'm like,

00:06:55.614 --> 00:06:57.583
I'm never doing that again.
Just the one time.

00:06:57.583 --> 00:06:59.118
Just gonna do it the one--
just the one--

00:06:59.118 --> 00:07:00.586
next week,
I'll take one other one.

00:07:00.586 --> 00:07:03.122
Later in the month, then two,
maybe--five a day.

00:07:03.122 --> 00:07:05.691
So like an alcoholic
drug addict,

00:07:05.691 --> 00:07:08.093
I escalated, and by that--
then, I was taking

00:07:08.093 --> 00:07:11.464
seven a day, and at that point,
I just had lost--it--

00:07:11.464 --> 00:07:13.466
[sighs] fuck, one day--
here's a perfect example.

00:07:13.466 --> 00:07:15.301
One day, I just fucking
showed up in the kitchen

00:07:15.301 --> 00:07:17.770
of my own house with a--
I had cut myself a Mohawk,

00:07:17.770 --> 00:07:20.039
and told my wife
I was starting a ska band.

00:07:20.039 --> 00:07:22.974
If--that, guys--
if you--first off,

00:07:22.974 --> 00:07:25.878
if--if your 50-year-old husband

00:07:25.878 --> 00:07:28.280
comes in and says
he wants to start a ska band,

00:07:28.280 --> 00:07:30.115
just take him to rehab,
just right away.

00:07:30.115 --> 00:07:32.618
Just take him--if anyone wants
to start a ska band today,

00:07:32.618 --> 00:07:34.553
fucking take them to rehab.

00:07:34.553 --> 00:07:36.288
Bad time.
Bad time.

00:07:36.288 --> 00:07:38.057
It's been played out, all right?

00:07:38.057 --> 00:07:39.492
So I was super fucked up

00:07:39.492 --> 00:07:41.794
and I did try and
start a ska band because--

00:07:41.794 --> 00:07:43.896
and I quit my other really
reliable jobs;

00:07:43.896 --> 00:07:45.130
comedy and writing books.

00:07:45.130 --> 00:07:47.567
So...

00:07:47.567 --> 00:07:49.301
I'd given up
those opportunities.

00:07:49.301 --> 00:07:50.803
Uh, my wife was very upset.

00:07:50.803 --> 00:07:52.905
I was a total fucking mess.
They took me to rehab.

00:07:52.905 --> 00:07:54.807
So now, I go to rehab.

00:07:54.807 --> 00:07:56.742
I pull my shit together.
I move back in the house.

00:07:56.742 --> 00:07:58.310
I can't live in the house.
They put me in a--

00:07:58.310 --> 00:07:59.845
I have a--we have a guesthouse,
in a garage.

00:07:59.845 --> 00:08:01.313
I live in the garage.
There's a place--

00:08:01.313 --> 00:08:03.983
It was on the other side
of the ho--yard.

00:08:03.983 --> 00:08:06.852
I lived in a closet on the other
side of the yard,

00:08:06.852 --> 00:08:08.921
but I--

00:08:08.921 --> 00:08:10.489
Right?
Hey, good night, everybody!

00:08:10.489 --> 00:08:12.191
Anyone?
So, uh, uh--

00:08:12.191 --> 00:08:13.859
But I was living there.

00:08:13.859 --> 00:08:16.361
But I really was, like, okay,
I'm gonna pull it together.

00:08:16.361 --> 00:08:17.696
I got on the right kind
of medication

00:08:17.696 --> 00:08:19.531
and I figured out that
I had some problems,

00:08:19.531 --> 00:08:21.267
and pulling my life together,
and I'm feeling good.

00:08:21.267 --> 00:08:22.534
And I kind of miss
the ska band.

00:08:22.534 --> 00:08:24.170
I really did want
to be a rock star.

00:08:24.170 --> 00:08:25.604
You know what I mean?
But I had to give up the--

00:08:25.604 --> 00:08:26.872
you know what I mean?
Not for--I mean,

00:08:26.872 --> 00:08:29.442
not that anyone noticed,
but anyway, so...

00:08:29.442 --> 00:08:32.211
I start working on my standup
and my career.

00:08:32.211 --> 00:08:33.713
I write a one-man show.

00:08:33.713 --> 00:08:36.014
I make friends with
my wife again--just friends.

00:08:36.014 --> 00:08:40.119
Anyway, I, um, uh,
I get my shit together

00:08:40.119 --> 00:08:42.054
and I'm feeling very good
about myself,

00:08:42.054 --> 00:08:44.389
because now I'm not the thing
that happens to you, right?

00:08:44.389 --> 00:08:45.691
I'm the guy experiencing life.

00:08:45.691 --> 00:08:47.293
I'm not gonna ruin
people's lives.

00:08:47.293 --> 00:08:48.894
I'm gonna be of service.
I'm gonna be a good person.

00:08:48.894 --> 00:08:50.863
I'm just gonna fucking just--
you know,

00:08:50.863 --> 00:08:52.564
just take it day-by-day,
have everything--

00:08:52.564 --> 00:08:54.066
You know, and things are good.

00:08:54.066 --> 00:08:55.067
My career's coming back.

00:08:55.067 --> 00:08:56.401
My wife likes me again.

00:08:56.401 --> 00:08:58.404
I get asked to go to Australia

00:08:58.404 --> 00:09:01.406
to perform for 22 nights in--
in Melbourne.

00:09:01.406 --> 00:09:02.908
Uh, a one-man show
that I've written.

00:09:02.908 --> 00:09:04.877
Very exciting.
Career's on the comeback.

00:09:04.877 --> 00:09:06.712
Got a big tour after that.
It's all good.

00:09:06.712 --> 00:09:08.147
I have a little stomachache.
It's fine.

00:09:08.147 --> 00:09:09.648
It's a little stomachache.

00:09:09.648 --> 00:09:11.050
I went to the doctor before
I left for Australia.

00:09:11.050 --> 00:09:12.084
He said it was gas.

00:09:12.084 --> 00:09:13.151
That's not good doctoring

00:09:13.151 --> 00:09:15.254
when you find out what it was.

00:09:15.254 --> 00:09:17.890
Eight shows into
my run in Australia,

00:09:17.890 --> 00:09:18.924
uh, I'm on fire.

00:09:18.924 --> 00:09:21.059
My insides are burning.
It's awful.

00:09:21.059 --> 00:09:22.895
I go to the doctor,
they give me some drugs,

00:09:22.895 --> 00:09:24.596
which I--oh, my gosh.
I remember these.

00:09:24.596 --> 00:09:26.331
Uh, they had to--they had to
give me some drugs

00:09:26.331 --> 00:09:28.433
because I was in so much pain,
I forgot even about drugs.

00:09:28.433 --> 00:09:30.903
I forgot that there were--like,
I was in "Kill me" pain.

00:09:30.903 --> 00:09:33.071
I was literally like the dog--
just end this.

00:09:33.071 --> 00:09:35.107
Just fucking end it.
I was in so much pain.

00:09:35.107 --> 00:09:37.242
They give me, um,
I don't know, whatever.

00:09:37.242 --> 00:09:38.744
Some sort of pain reliever.

00:09:38.744 --> 00:09:40.112
And then they take a photo
of my insides,

00:09:40.112 --> 00:09:41.781
and then they wake me up,
and they say,

00:09:41.781 --> 00:09:44.449
"You have tumors in your
stomach--you have cancer."

00:09:44.449 --> 00:09:46.117
Fuck.
I was on my way to a comeback.

00:09:46.117 --> 00:09:49.354
Um, so that's what they said.
You have a--

00:09:49.354 --> 00:09:50.622
but it was in Australia,
so I have to say,

00:09:50.622 --> 00:09:51.957
and I'm not saying get cancer.

00:09:51.957 --> 00:09:55.027
I'm against it.
I'm against cancer.

00:09:55.027 --> 00:09:57.596
I just want to come out right
now and say I'm against cancer.

00:09:57.596 --> 00:09:59.264
I don't want you to get it.

00:09:59.264 --> 00:10:01.266
Should you think you have it,

00:10:01.266 --> 00:10:02.968
go to Australia
to get the diagnosis,

00:10:02.968 --> 00:10:05.204
because just the way
they say "cancer"

00:10:05.204 --> 00:10:09.274
sounds a tiny bit less bad.

00:10:09.274 --> 00:10:11.810
That's all. "Cancer."
It just goes up at the end.

00:10:11.810 --> 00:10:13.612
It just--"Cancer, mate.
You have cancer, mate."

00:10:13.612 --> 00:10:14.613
They say "mate" a lot.

00:10:14.613 --> 00:10:15.714
It just feels cheerier,

00:10:15.714 --> 00:10:16.715
like you're doing it together.

00:10:16.715 --> 00:10:17.816
"Hey, you got cancer, mate."

00:10:17.816 --> 00:10:19.384
"We all do?"
"No, you do."

00:10:19.384 --> 00:10:21.487
Anyway, cancer. They told me.
I had it.

00:10:21.487 --> 00:10:22.487
Uh, they thought I did.

00:10:22.487 --> 00:10:24.056
I had tumors in my stomach,

00:10:24.056 --> 00:10:25.557
they weren't sure what they
were, but they were--

00:10:25.557 --> 00:10:27.492
there was a cluster of tumors,
right?

00:10:27.492 --> 00:10:28.994
Just really--a lot of Rs.
A lot of--

00:10:28.994 --> 00:10:31.330
You find out there's a lot of Rs
in cancer.

00:10:31.330 --> 00:10:33.332
"Cluster," "tumor"--
lot of Rs.

00:10:33.332 --> 00:10:34.666
So I-I--

00:10:34.666 --> 00:10:36.635
They think I have cancer,
and they say,

00:10:36.635 --> 00:10:38.670
"You have to go home,"
and I was so high

00:10:38.670 --> 00:10:39.671
on whatever it was they gave me,
I'm like,

00:10:39.671 --> 00:10:41.640
"To my apartment in Australia?"

00:10:41.640 --> 00:10:42.808
And they go, "No, to America."

00:10:42.808 --> 00:10:45.143
You have to take
your cancer home.

00:10:45.143 --> 00:10:46.745
You have to take it home.
Can't have it there.

00:10:46.745 --> 00:10:48.480
They--they don't want you
dying there.

00:10:48.480 --> 00:10:51.817
So, um, uh,
so I say, "All right."

00:10:51.817 --> 00:10:53.818
And they, uh, they say,
"But you're gonna be in pain

00:10:53.818 --> 00:10:55.321
"until you get to the hospital.

00:10:55.321 --> 00:10:57.322
"You need to get there within
the next 72 hours.

00:10:57.322 --> 00:10:59.158
But here is a box of OxyContin."

00:10:59.158 --> 00:11:01.193
I'm like, that could
be a mistake.

00:11:01.193 --> 00:11:02.928
A box.
Not just a few.

00:11:02.928 --> 00:11:05.263
A fucking box.
Like, with trays.

00:11:05.263 --> 00:11:06.532
Do you understand?

00:11:06.532 --> 00:11:07.866
We're talking about
a street value

00:11:07.866 --> 00:11:09.367
of about a million dollars!

00:11:09.367 --> 00:11:11.002
To a drug addict!

00:11:11.002 --> 00:11:12.838
Who's already high from whatever
it is they gave them--

00:11:12.838 --> 00:11:14.873
I went out and bought a hat.

00:11:14.873 --> 00:11:16.842
So...

00:11:16.842 --> 00:11:18.944
Here's how high I was.

00:11:18.944 --> 00:11:20.846
I had my manager with me.
I said, "Take the pills.

00:11:20.846 --> 00:11:22.548
"Give 'em to me, and let's be
responsible about this.

00:11:22.548 --> 00:11:24.350
"I just want to get home.
I want to see my family.

00:11:24.350 --> 00:11:26.785
If I'm gonna die, fair enough,
but I just want to get home."

00:11:26.785 --> 00:11:30.121
So, uh, I go, uh, to, uh,
the airport,

00:11:30.121 --> 00:11:32.024
and everything's fine, except
for I accidently put a knife

00:11:32.024 --> 00:11:33.726
in my backpack.
That's--you don't--

00:11:33.726 --> 00:11:35.460
you're not allowed to take
a knife through customs.

00:11:35.460 --> 00:11:37.563
I don't know if I'm sharing
anything new with you guys,

00:11:37.563 --> 00:11:40.232
but no knives at customs
on an international flight.

00:11:40.232 --> 00:11:41.734
They don't care for it.

00:11:41.734 --> 00:11:43.969
So I had a knife in my backpack,
and the lady goes--

00:11:43.969 --> 00:11:45.370
she was very nice,
and she said,

00:11:45.370 --> 00:11:46.639
"Sir, this is a knife."

00:11:46.639 --> 00:11:49.742
And I said to her,
"I have cancer."

00:11:52.577 --> 00:11:56.882
She literally goes,
"Uh..."

00:11:56.882 --> 00:11:58.417
I don't know
what the next sentence is.

00:11:58.417 --> 00:12:00.919
Like, literally, I don't know
what to say to you.

00:12:00.919 --> 00:12:03.255
So she's like, "Well, you still
have to leave the knife,

00:12:03.255 --> 00:12:04.423
but I'll give you a hug."

00:12:04.423 --> 00:12:06.759
So...

00:12:06.759 --> 00:12:09.327
My--my manager's with me,

00:12:09.327 --> 00:12:11.163
so that's my thing.
I'm like, "Just make sure

00:12:11.163 --> 00:12:12.898
"that I don't overuse
the drugs, 'cause I could,

00:12:12.898 --> 00:12:14.566
"and because I'm dying,
I probably don't care.

00:12:14.566 --> 00:12:16.434
"So make me care and don't let
me take all the drugs,

00:12:16.434 --> 00:12:18.570
'cause I don't want to show up
at home being that guy."

00:12:18.570 --> 00:12:19.938
So I get on the airplane,

00:12:19.938 --> 00:12:21.840
and they stick my manager
in fucking economy

00:12:21.840 --> 00:12:23.508
and they put me in first class,
so I know I'm dying, right?

00:12:23.508 --> 00:12:24.743
I know it's a Make-A-Wish thing.

00:12:24.743 --> 00:12:26.345
"Put him in first class,

00:12:26.345 --> 00:12:27.779
it's probably the last time
he'll be on a plane."

00:12:27.779 --> 00:12:30.582
So they throw him
in fucking baggage

00:12:30.582 --> 00:12:33.084
and I'm sitting in a throne or
a--you know, whatever it is.

00:12:33.084 --> 00:12:35.521
Just this massive thing
where they give you backrubs.

00:12:35.521 --> 00:12:37.789
And I'm sitting next to a guy
who I don't know,

00:12:37.789 --> 00:12:40.092
who turns out to be this drummer
for the band Switchfoot.

00:12:40.092 --> 00:12:41.426
Do you guys know
Switchfoot at all?

00:12:41.426 --> 00:12:42.761
Yeah? Yeah?

00:12:42.761 --> 00:12:43.962
That's usually
the response I get.

00:12:43.962 --> 00:12:44.964
Yeah...

00:12:44.964 --> 00:12:46.298
So, uh, anyway--

00:12:46.298 --> 00:12:47.933
they're a fine band,
they're a fine band.

00:12:47.933 --> 00:12:48.933
I don't know them,
but I know who they are.

00:12:48.933 --> 00:12:50.635
But I--I know that they surf,

00:12:50.635 --> 00:12:52.604
and I know they're Christian,
and that's all I know.

00:12:52.604 --> 00:12:53.806
Probably couldn't sing a song,

00:12:53.806 --> 00:12:55.040
but the guy's super nice,

00:12:55.040 --> 00:12:57.275
the drummer,
and so we start talking,

00:12:57.275 --> 00:12:59.044
I say, "Look, I'm gonna ask you
a really weird favor,

00:12:59.044 --> 00:13:00.946
"but I'm dying--maybe--
probably--

00:13:00.946 --> 00:13:02.314
"and, uh, I have to take
these pills,

00:13:02.314 --> 00:13:03.715
"and would you give them to me
and not let me

00:13:03.715 --> 00:13:04.984
"take more than I need
and make sure

00:13:04.984 --> 00:13:06.651
I take them when
I'm supposed to?"

00:13:06.651 --> 00:13:08.120
And he said, "Yeah, sure."
I said, "Thank you."

00:13:08.120 --> 00:13:10.288
Also, if I get up--
like, if I rub your chest

00:13:10.288 --> 00:13:11.823
or walk around the plane, or--

00:13:11.823 --> 00:13:13.726
I don't know if any of you have
ever been on OxyContin,

00:13:13.726 --> 00:13:15.827
but it's not bad.
Yeah, you feel--

00:13:15.827 --> 00:13:17.463
you're friendly,
and you like conversations,

00:13:17.463 --> 00:13:20.232
and you want to talk to everyone
about everything, and you also--

00:13:20.232 --> 00:13:22.134
It has this amazing thing
that never happens to me

00:13:22.134 --> 00:13:24.636
in real life--it actually makes
you want to listen to people.

00:13:24.636 --> 00:13:26.806
So...

00:13:26.806 --> 00:13:28.740
Like, you're genuinely
interested in weird shit.

00:13:28.740 --> 00:13:30.142
What kind of buttons are those?

00:13:30.142 --> 00:13:32.411
"On my--on my shirt?"
Yeah. They seem neat.

00:13:32.411 --> 00:13:35.914
All right.

00:13:35.914 --> 00:13:38.350
Anyway, the guy was super nice
and I said, "Would you make sure

00:13:38.350 --> 00:13:40.485
I don't overuse these?"
And then I passed out

00:13:40.485 --> 00:13:42.354
and I slept the whole flight.

00:13:42.354 --> 00:13:44.656
You know.
Uh, and, uh,

00:13:44.656 --> 00:13:47.025
so, we get to Los Angeles,

00:13:47.025 --> 00:13:49.862
and, uh--and uh,
so it's cool.

00:13:49.862 --> 00:13:51.697
I'm sitting next to a guy
from a band.

00:13:51.697 --> 00:13:52.998
That's neat, and he says,

00:13:52.998 --> 00:13:54.533
"Let me walk
you to baggage claim."

00:13:54.533 --> 00:13:57.202
So the drummer from Switchfoot
walks me to baggage claim,

00:13:57.202 --> 00:13:59.004
gets my bags for me,
and then he goes,

00:13:59.004 --> 00:14:01.707
"Hey, man, I just want to tell
you that I love you.

00:14:01.707 --> 00:14:03.275
"I said a prayer for you.

00:14:03.275 --> 00:14:04.343
You're gonna be fine."

00:14:04.343 --> 00:14:05.544
And I was like, wow.

00:14:05.544 --> 00:14:07.178
And I bent down
to pick up my bags,

00:14:07.178 --> 00:14:11.783
and I turned around,
and he was fucking gone.

00:14:11.783 --> 00:14:13.953
Gone--not, like,
oh, in a crowd.

00:14:13.953 --> 00:14:17.289
Like, fucking--
there was nobody--

00:14:17.289 --> 00:14:20.458
he was gone!

00:14:20.458 --> 00:14:21.559
I was like, fuck!

00:14:21.559 --> 00:14:24.029
Did I dream that?

00:14:24.029 --> 00:14:25.230
Were these my last moments?

00:14:25.230 --> 00:14:27.699
I had a lucid dream?

00:14:27.699 --> 00:14:32.070
Why the guy from Switchfoot?

00:14:32.070 --> 00:14:34.073
Thank you.
