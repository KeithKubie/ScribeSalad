00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:06.110
We're asked to factor 35k
squared plus 100k, minus 15.

00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:10.930
And because we have a non-1
coefficient out here, the best

00:00:10.930 --> 00:00:14.600
thing to do is probably to
factor this by grouping.

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:16.870
But before we even do that,
let's see if there's a common

00:00:16.870 --> 00:00:19.250
factor across all of these
terms, and maybe we can get a

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:20.280
1 coefficient, out there.

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:22.140
If we can't get a 1 coefficient,
we'll at least

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:23.660
have a lower coefficient here.

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:25.950
And if we look at all of these
numbers, they all look

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:27.140
divisible by 5.

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:30.680
In fact their greatest
common factor is 5.

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:32.270
So let's at least
factor out a 5.

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:36.560
So this is equal to 5
times-- 35k squared

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:41.430
divided by 5 is 7k squared.

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:46.090
100k divided by 5 is 20k.

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:50.610
And then negative 15 divided
by 5 is negative 3.

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:53.710
So we were able to factor out a
5, but we still don't have a

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:56.350
1 coefficient here, so we're
still going to have to factor

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:57.300
by grouping.

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:00.500
But at least the numbers here
are smaller so it'll be easier

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:03.800
to think about it in terms of
finding numbers whose product

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:06.200
is equal to 7 times negative
3, and whose

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:08.140
sum is equal to 20.

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:09.120
So let's think about that.

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:12.970
Let's figure out two numbers
that if I were to add them, or

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:16.680
even better if I were to take
their product, I get 7 times

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:23.530
negative 3, which is equal
to negative 21.

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:27.590
And if I were to take their
sum, if I add those two

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:34.190
numbers, it needs to
be equal to 20.

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:37.360
Now, once again, because their
product is a negative number,

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:39.820
that means they have to be of
different signs, so when you

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:42.440
add numbers of different signs,
you could view it as

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:44.870
you're taking the difference
of the positive versions.

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:46.930
So the difference between the
positive versions of the

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:48.400
number has to be 20.

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:50.550
So the number that immediately
jumps out is we're probably

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:53.640
going to be dealing with 20
and 21, and 1 will be the

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:56.230
negative, because we want
to get to a positive 20.

00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:57.710
So let's think about it.

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:01.980
So if we think of 20 and
negative 1, their product is

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:03.530
negative 21.

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:04.100
Sorry.

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:10.330
If we take 21 and negative 1,
their product is negative 21.

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:13.060
21 times negative 1
is negative 21.

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:16.200
and if you take their sum,
21 plus negative 1,

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:17.820
that is equal to 20.

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:21.940
So these two numbers right
there fit the bill.

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:26.700
Now, let's break up this 20k
right here into a 21k and a

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:29.430
negative 1k.

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:29.770
So let's do that.

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:31.560
So let's rewrite the
whole thing.

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:36.720
We have 5 times 7k squared, and
I'm going to break this

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:42.296
20k into a-- let me do it in
this color right here-- I'm

00:02:42.296 --> 00:02:48.940
going to break that 20k into
a plus 21k, minus k.

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:51.270
Or you could say minus
1k if you want.

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:53.370
I'm using those two factors
to break it up.

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:57.760
And then we finally have the
minus 3 right there.

00:02:57.760 --> 00:02:59.940
Now, the whole point of doing
that is so that we can now

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:03.420
factor each of the two groups.

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:06.400
This could be our first
group right here.

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:09.600
And so what can we factor out
of that group right there?

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:12.530
Well, both of these are
divisible by 7k, so we can

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:19.210
write this as 7k times-- 7k
squared divided by 7k, you're

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:20.990
just going to have
a k left over.

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:27.570
And then plus 21k divided by
7k is just going to be a 3.

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:29.330
So that factors into that.

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:33.290
And then we can look at
this group right here.

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:34.310
They have a common factor.

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:36.930
Well, we can factor out a
negative 1 if we like, so this

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:42.160
is equal to negative 1 times--
k divided by negative 1 is k.

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:46.050
Negative 3 divided by negative
1 is positive 3.

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:48.215
And, of course, we have this
5 sitting out there.

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:55.080
Now, ignoring that 5 for a
second, you see that both of

00:03:55.080 --> 00:04:02.380
these inside terms have
k plus 3 as a factor.

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:04.360
So we can factor that out.

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:06.150
So let's ignore this
5 for a second.

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:08.860
This inside part right here,
the stuff that's inside the

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:13.260
parentheses, we can factor k
plus 3 out, and it becomes k

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:24.980
plus 3, times k plus 3,
times 7k minus 1.

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:28.110
And if this seems a little
bizarre to you, distribute the

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:29.270
k plus 3 on to this.

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:31.970
K plus 3 times 7k is that term,
k plus 3 times negative

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:33.050
1 is that term.

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:35.060
And, of course, the whole
time you have

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:36.640
that 5 sitting outside.

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:37.300
You have that 5.

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:38.650
We don't even have to put
parentheses there.

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:42.770
5 times k plus 3, times
7k minus 1.

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:45.050
And we factored it,
we're done.
