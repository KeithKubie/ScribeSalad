1
00:00:02,340 --> 00:00:02,580
Okay.

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:06,030
Hey, what's going on? It's Bill Burr and
it's time for the Thursday afternoon.

3
00:00:06,031 --> 00:00:08,520
Just before Friday.
Monday morning podcast and all.

4
00:00:12,380 --> 00:00:12,490
Ah,

5
00:00:12,490 --> 00:00:14,110
just checking in on you.

6
00:00:14,650 --> 00:00:18,250
I'm just checking in to see how
your week's going. You know,

7
00:00:18,730 --> 00:00:23,050
you know who I'm talking
about. Oh, you brave warriors,

8
00:00:24,190 --> 00:00:28,120
you social justice people,
you know, misunderstood,

9
00:00:30,230 --> 00:00:33,890
uh, you suffering white women
in your fucking SUV is, I just,

10
00:00:33,891 --> 00:00:38,750
you know what you do day in and day out
is so difficult and I'm just checking in

11
00:00:39,110 --> 00:00:42,770
to make sure that you're living your
truth and whatever else is written on your

12
00:00:42,771 --> 00:00:45,380
fucking yoga pants.
How are you everybody?

13
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,060
I'm a New York City,
New York City,

14
00:00:50,390 --> 00:00:55,020
skyscrapers and everything. Um, yeah,

15
00:00:55,070 --> 00:00:58,430
I've been here for a couple of days and a,
I'm having a good time doing stand up,

16
00:00:58,490 --> 00:00:58,880
you know,

17
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:02,930
even though it's like doing fucking
stand up at a woman's college now I can,

18
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:06,710
I have never, Eh, this trip,

19
00:01:06,740 --> 00:01:08,210
I swear to fucking Christ.

20
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:13,160
I've gotten more grown standing
on stage doing my bullshit act.

21
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:17,420
Then I got my entire time when I lived
here for New York for like 10 years.

22
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:18,710
Like it's,

23
00:01:18,740 --> 00:01:23,300
it's fucking crazy what has happened
to this comedy. This was one of,

24
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:27,680
this used to be one of the
great comedy cities. Oh my God.

25
00:01:28,850 --> 00:01:29,290
Yeah.

26
00:01:29,290 --> 00:01:30,130
You stand on stage.

27
00:01:30,131 --> 00:01:34,450
You feel like somebody is like fucking
stepping on a puppy behind you.

28
00:01:34,620 --> 00:01:38,330
You're like, what did I say?
What? What happened? Ah,

29
00:01:39,410 --> 00:01:43,540
like the old time.
I am really holding on to this,

30
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:48,600
this hope that this is just a ridiculous
phase that this country is going

31
00:01:50,671 --> 00:01:55,671
through this ridiculous phase where we
have allowed like 8% of the population in

32
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:57,330
,

33
00:01:57,330 --> 00:02:02,330
they're unbelievably extreme lunatic ideas
to push us so far to the fucking left

34
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:06,300
at me as a lefty.
Like now I feel like,

35
00:02:06,301 --> 00:02:08,940
do I need to start
watching fucking Fox News?

36
00:02:10,140 --> 00:02:14,880
Is this where the middle is now watching
those costs on that fucking channel?

37
00:02:14,881 --> 00:02:16,640
I mean I don't know what to do here.

38
00:02:18,070 --> 00:02:18,480
Okay.

39
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:22,170
I Dunno. All I can tell you is when I
did stand up over in Europe, like the,

40
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:24,360
the level that they
were laughing at us for,

41
00:02:24,361 --> 00:02:27,120
what the fuck we're doing because
we're all in a bubble over here.

42
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:28,770
I don't know what the deal is,

43
00:02:29,370 --> 00:02:33,750
but I think it's a sad state that I
went to formerly communist Europe.

44
00:02:35,730 --> 00:02:39,410
Um, and I felt freer to speak
over there then I fuck do here,

45
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:43,650
but it's unbelievable. Oh. Um,

46
00:02:43,950 --> 00:02:46,410
but actually not in
defense of New York City.

47
00:02:46,411 --> 00:02:49,320
I think I've been going
further in the grown direction

48
00:02:51,190 --> 00:02:55,210
just as a reaction to it. Like, so I,

49
00:02:55,211 --> 00:02:58,980
I could give myself some
space, you know, it's,

50
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,080
it's fucking claustrophobic. I
don't, I really don't understand.

51
00:03:02,081 --> 00:03:05,590
I just don't understand adults
going to comedy shows and,

52
00:03:07,510 --> 00:03:09,580
um, I don't know. You know what?
But you know, it was great.

53
00:03:09,581 --> 00:03:12,970
Was the Patrice O'Neal comedy
benefit that was fucking phenomenal.

54
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:16,390
And um,
actually one of the comics,

55
00:03:16,391 --> 00:03:19,480
Mark Norman had a fucking
great joke on shit like that,

56
00:03:19,481 --> 00:03:22,840
about people getting offended,
which I won't tell cause it's his joke.

57
00:03:23,290 --> 00:03:25,580
So go out and go see them live.
Um,

58
00:03:25,630 --> 00:03:29,350
thank you to everybody on
that came out this year.

59
00:03:29,351 --> 00:03:31,690
I don't have the names in front of me,
so I know I'm going to forget somebody.

60
00:03:31,691 --> 00:03:36,250
Michelle Wolf, Jay Oakerson, rich vos
hosting it for the seventh year in a row.

61
00:03:36,251 --> 00:03:40,570
Mark Norman, Joe Lists, uh,
Gary Gulman, Chris read,

62
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:44,970
um, my mom and my mom. I
know I'm forgetting like
two or three people. I will,

63
00:03:44,980 --> 00:03:49,480
everybody went out and
fucking killed. It was, uh,

64
00:03:50,170 --> 00:03:52,690
you know, we got great feedback
about it. It was just, it's just,

65
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:56,740
it's one of my favorite things in
the world to do. And like I said,

66
00:03:56,741 --> 00:04:01,741
all the money goes to
his mom and his wife and,

67
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:05,890
uh, you know, and people have asked,
well, why do you do it every single year?

68
00:04:05,950 --> 00:04:08,590
You know, it's like boat,
which is one theater gig.

69
00:04:09,370 --> 00:04:11,610
And Patrice was supporting those people.
And I always hated it.

70
00:04:11,611 --> 00:04:16,570
When somebody dies. You do like one
fucking, you do it once. He like, Oh gay,

71
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:20,710
there's a sack of money. Try to
stretch that out for the next fucking,

72
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:25,150
I don't know, 20, 30, 50, 60 years
that you live in, you know. Um,

73
00:04:25,210 --> 00:04:28,720
he was taken care of him. So,
uh, he unfortunately passed away.

74
00:04:28,721 --> 00:04:30,310
So all the comics,

75
00:04:30,460 --> 00:04:35,110
make sure that we were taken care of
who Patrice was taken care of. So, um,

76
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:39,400
like I said, all they should have to deal
with his degree for him not being here.

77
00:04:39,401 --> 00:04:42,490
Other than that, you know, we should all
be helping them out, which we're doing.

78
00:04:42,491 --> 00:04:45,220
So thank you from the bottom of my heart
to everybody who shows up to the thing

79
00:04:45,221 --> 00:04:50,080
and everybody comes out and donates
their free time. Oh, Maureen Taren,

80
00:04:50,081 --> 00:04:54,880
who puts the whole thing
together. Um, it's, it's, uh,

81
00:04:54,910 --> 00:04:58,240
it's just awesome. So we're already
thinking about the lineup for next year,

82
00:04:58,690 --> 00:05:03,160
kind of see if I can get Paul Versey, you
know, got to get very easy to come down.

83
00:05:03,550 --> 00:05:06,040
Um, for some dumb reason, I
haven't asked him to do it yet.

84
00:05:06,070 --> 00:05:07,210
There's always somebody every year.
I'm like,

85
00:05:07,211 --> 00:05:11,830
why the fuck haven't I asked that
person yet? So, uh, that is the deal.

86
00:05:12,370 --> 00:05:16,660
Um, anyways, let's talk
in the news. Oh my God.

87
00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:20,410
You know, everybody is
talking about this, uh,

88
00:05:21,580 --> 00:05:26,560
this Jessie Smith and Lewinski, whatever
his fucking name is. Juicy, juicy,

89
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:31,840
small, let Jesse Small that
everybody's talking about that.

90
00:05:31,841 --> 00:05:34,570
But I don't think that's
the biggest news. And, uh,

91
00:05:35,260 --> 00:05:40,150
the biggest story in the news right now,
I think it's as I on Williamson's Nike.

92
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:42,910
Okay.
The brand that Paul Versey love,

93
00:05:42,970 --> 00:05:47,500
like it literally exploded on his
foot and caused him to have injury.

94
00:05:49,690 --> 00:05:49,871
Now,

95
00:05:49,871 --> 00:05:54,871
I can't imagine how many older white guys
like me with the dad bod that are now

96
00:05:55,031 --> 00:06:00,031
going to reconsider buying Nikes because
if it can't withstand the power of Zion

97
00:06:02,390 --> 00:06:04,880
Williamson, how is it with Stan? Me,

98
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:11,570
I'm trying to think of some dads.
Shit, I'm unfolding a stroller.

99
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:16,040
Oh God. Can you imagine what those evil
constant run Nike can you met that?

100
00:06:16,050 --> 00:06:18,710
I bet they bet they have the
serial number on that sneaker.

101
00:06:18,950 --> 00:06:22,190
And they attracted down that fucking
four year old that glued that thing

102
00:06:22,191 --> 00:06:26,880
together. Oh my God. What are
they going? Oh, Jesus Christ.

103
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:30,930
Probably going to hang them upside down
for the next month by his fucking toes.

104
00:06:32,850 --> 00:06:35,150
Yeah. Make them wear Adidas or
some shit. I don't know what,

105
00:06:35,151 --> 00:06:39,200
but I can tell you something right now.
They are rejoicing at Adidas, Reebok,

106
00:06:41,090 --> 00:06:44,450
uh, pro keds. Whoever else makes fucking
sneakers. I gotta be honest with you man,

107
00:06:44,930 --> 00:06:48,620
that is like, I have not seen
a guy, this is Zion Williamson.

108
00:06:48,650 --> 00:06:51,260
This if you Miss Bo Jackson,

109
00:06:52,430 --> 00:06:56,270
like this is what you're watching.
Like somebody who just comes along.

110
00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:01,600
Yeah. I mean he's literally
what the fuck this guy did.

111
00:07:01,601 --> 00:07:05,560
Like I could not do that to a
sneaker if I got hit by a car,

112
00:07:07,780 --> 00:07:11,680
I'd have to get hit by some farm equipment
and lose my leg for my sneaker to

113
00:07:11,681 --> 00:07:15,580
look like that. That was just
the sheer strength of this man

114
00:07:17,140 --> 00:07:21,220
making a cut or whatever. I
have no idea. But that reminded,

115
00:07:21,221 --> 00:07:25,300
the only thing I'd ever seen like that
is you ever watched that shit on Bo

116
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:27,160
Jackson? How he ended up, um,

117
00:07:27,730 --> 00:07:32,730
having that career ending injury is he
was running with such speed and had like

118
00:07:33,371 --> 00:07:38,371
a 250 lineback pound linebacker hanging
on his leg as he continued to drag the

119
00:07:40,001 --> 00:07:44,590
guy down the field and just,
it was weird.

120
00:07:44,591 --> 00:07:48,310
It was like his own strength
worked against him because
anybody else would have

121
00:07:48,311 --> 00:07:53,311
just fell down like a fucking sack of
potatoes and he continued to run with 250

122
00:07:53,411 --> 00:07:58,270
fucking pounds hanging
on him. Um, unbelievable.

123
00:07:58,330 --> 00:08:01,630
So I help that kids. All right.
I heard he is all right. Um,

124
00:08:02,250 --> 00:08:06,400
I'm sure nobody on the tar heels side of
the fucking court was upset that he was

125
00:08:06,401 --> 00:08:08,750
out for most of the gang. I think he came
back. I don't even know what happened. I,

126
00:08:08,751 --> 00:08:12,970
I'm missing everything. Like my
Boston Bruins. Hey, we go bro words.

127
00:08:12,971 --> 00:08:15,460
Here we go.
Um,

128
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:21,430
have one seven in a row and I've missed
every game. I've been following it. Um,

129
00:08:21,490 --> 00:08:25,030
I heard there was a high stick goal that
we got away with against the La Kings

130
00:08:25,031 --> 00:08:27,630
or whatever and uh,
so we ended up winning in overtime.

131
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:32,200
We just want in a shootout
against Vancouver. Um, you know,

132
00:08:32,620 --> 00:08:34,060
big, big, big points.

133
00:08:34,061 --> 00:08:38,950
Getting 14 points out of 14 points
this time a year going into March,

134
00:08:38,980 --> 00:08:42,070
moving up the playoff thing. I
think we said they moved up to, uh,

135
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,580
the sixth seat or something like that.
Sweet 16.

136
00:08:45,581 --> 00:08:47,980
I don't know what the fuck they said,
but all I know is what playing well.

137
00:08:47,981 --> 00:08:52,840
So that makes me happy. And when I get
on the other side of my special here, uh,

138
00:08:52,841 --> 00:08:56,610
I will be looking forward to maybe
take it in a game two. Um, all right,

139
00:08:56,611 --> 00:08:59,610
so let's talk about Jeff.
Jesse smaller.

140
00:09:01,270 --> 00:09:05,620
Jesus fucking Christ. I, I've been
watching this story just cringing.

141
00:09:07,430 --> 00:09:11,240
You know, in the beginning it was
depressing. Like Jesus Christ.

142
00:09:11,570 --> 00:09:16,250
Like why would somebody do
that to somebody? But then
when it started to unravel,

143
00:09:17,590 --> 00:09:19,720
um, yeah, just like, oh no, please, no.

144
00:09:20,830 --> 00:09:21,000
Okay,

145
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,180
please tell me you didn't do this to
your foot fucking guys on like one of the

146
00:09:24,181 --> 00:09:28,890
biggest shows on fucking TV.
If this is true,

147
00:09:30,340 --> 00:09:33,130
that's why I don't like talking about
it like, until it's like proven,

148
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:38,120
but it's looking fucking bed. What?
You don't, you know what I mean?

149
00:09:38,121 --> 00:09:39,740
You know what's fucked up is everybody,

150
00:09:39,741 --> 00:09:43,400
doesn't everybody have like
a hero fantasy, you know,

151
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:46,610
will you stop a bank robbery,
uh, stops up terrorists.

152
00:09:46,611 --> 00:09:49,370
He ended up landing the plane or some
shit, and next thing you know you're,

153
00:09:49,670 --> 00:09:53,030
you're on Oprah and she's talking to you.
Just go in like,

154
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:57,770
how are you so amazing?
And you're like, ah,

155
00:09:57,771 --> 00:10:00,740
you know, shucks. I was just
doing my job as a passenger.

156
00:10:01,550 --> 00:10:04,760
I did what anybody else you say of all
your rush shuck slides and then all of a

157
00:10:04,761 --> 00:10:05,780
sudden you're like,

158
00:10:06,650 --> 00:10:09,800
you wake up from the interview when
you realize you just drive it down the

159
00:10:09,801 --> 00:10:13,250
street or you or you were talking to
yourself and somebody saw you, you know,

160
00:10:13,910 --> 00:10:16,280
at least performers,
we're all a little bit nuts like that,

161
00:10:16,281 --> 00:10:18,290
but to fucking follow through with it.

162
00:10:20,190 --> 00:10:22,080
Then this guy ever watched the first 48

163
00:10:23,810 --> 00:10:25,890
some of the ways they catch people.
Now I,

164
00:10:25,910 --> 00:10:29,660
it's weird because I should be rooting
for them, but it's just, you just,

165
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:33,520
I watched some of these forensics
shows. It's like, oh, what the fuck?

166
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:37,200
You can figure it out from that.

167
00:10:38,990 --> 00:10:42,830
I remember one time this guy suffocated
this woman using a fucking garbage bag

168
00:10:42,831 --> 00:10:46,810
and they somehow found her, her
fucking face in the bag. Okay.

169
00:10:48,530 --> 00:10:50,410
You know,
I gotta hand it to murder is the,

170
00:10:50,420 --> 00:10:52,400
I don't know if they just
caught up on the emotion of it,

171
00:10:52,401 --> 00:10:55,400
but like they're fucking belief in
themselves that they're going to get away

172
00:10:55,401 --> 00:10:58,670
with this shit. They should really
just watch a couple episodes.

173
00:10:58,671 --> 00:11:02,270
I like the first 48 or one of
these forensics fucking shows.

174
00:11:02,271 --> 00:11:05,780
I don't know how anybody gets
away with anything, but um,

175
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:11,880
I got us, be honest with you now
that it's unraveling the bleach,

176
00:11:11,910 --> 00:11:15,930
the maggot hat magnet, what does it
make? America great again. Mag a mag.

177
00:11:15,931 --> 00:11:19,200
I had the fucking, uh,
the noose around his neck.

178
00:11:19,590 --> 00:11:23,880
It all kind of reads like, you know, when
you do a first table, read up a script,

179
00:11:24,570 --> 00:11:27,360
you know, you're like, ah, it's getting
there to get, he should've work.

180
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:32,160
Shopped it a little more. I would
have gone, would not have had the hat,

181
00:11:33,470 --> 00:11:35,860
wouldn't have had the new, it's
it. Oh, the news. So whatever.

182
00:11:35,861 --> 00:11:37,060
You know what it's like.
It's like, you know,

183
00:11:37,061 --> 00:11:39,220
when one of the star
light goes out and they,

184
00:11:39,310 --> 00:11:41,550
they accessorize too much and
then they go, you know what,

185
00:11:42,010 --> 00:11:44,920
when it bright before you go out,
take two things off.

186
00:11:44,921 --> 00:11:46,140
Like that's what he should've done.

187
00:11:47,050 --> 00:11:49,960
Should've got rid of the
news and the fucking hat

188
00:11:51,580 --> 00:11:54,160
and uh,
I don't get it.

189
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:56,900
The only thing that doesn't
make sense if this was fake,

190
00:11:56,920 --> 00:12:01,920
like what kind of a fucking asshole
for 3,500 bucks is going to go to jail

191
00:12:03,660 --> 00:12:06,810
and then have a hate crime on your
fucking record for the rest of your life?

192
00:12:08,490 --> 00:12:12,510
I guess they were assuming that they
were going to get away with it. Um,

193
00:12:14,020 --> 00:12:18,640
I dunno man. It's just the eye. Is
it weird? I feel bad for the guy.

194
00:12:20,220 --> 00:12:23,420
It just reminds me when I was a kid and
I started lying to my parents and it's

195
00:12:23,421 --> 00:12:25,950
just fucking got out of
control and then it's all,

196
00:12:26,070 --> 00:12:29,820
you know what it reminds me
of. Okay. This is a true story.

197
00:12:30,030 --> 00:12:31,850
I'm going to show you my,
my Jesse's,

198
00:12:32,010 --> 00:12:34,890
we all got a little Jesse
similar smell let in us. Right.

199
00:12:37,170 --> 00:12:41,340
Okay. So one time when I was in my
first year of first grade, right.

200
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:43,910
I loved it so much. I did it twice. Um,

201
00:12:47,190 --> 00:12:49,410
when it came to school,
I was like,

202
00:12:49,411 --> 00:12:53,010
that fucking hurdler who just hit the
first fucking hurdle and fell on his

203
00:12:53,011 --> 00:12:56,550
goddamn face in the fucking race
was just over, you know, that was,

204
00:12:56,551 --> 00:13:00,810
that was my school career. So anyways, um,

205
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:03,240
that was one of the
first jokes I ever wrote.

206
00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:06,960
Talking about the second year of first
grade, how fucking boring it was.

207
00:13:07,140 --> 00:13:09,900
Cause you learn how to read
and you literally learn how
to read the first grade.

208
00:13:09,901 --> 00:13:10,920
At least you did back then.

209
00:13:10,921 --> 00:13:14,940
So I remember like the first three months
being bored out of my mind is these

210
00:13:14,941 --> 00:13:18,450
kids was sounding out the words.
They would sit next to me going like,

211
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:21,570
Duh,
Duh Duh.

212
00:13:22,290 --> 00:13:24,180
In my joke on my hack was duck,

213
00:13:25,410 --> 00:13:29,340
the word is duck to matter.
The picture didn't give it away.

214
00:13:30,090 --> 00:13:34,440
That was my first really decent laugh.
I've got my laugh. Am I act? It was,

215
00:13:34,441 --> 00:13:35,340
it was clean.

216
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:39,420
People thought I was on my way to doing
the tonight show with Johnny Carson.

217
00:13:39,450 --> 00:13:42,030
That's how long ago this
was. Um, so anyways,

218
00:13:42,110 --> 00:13:46,910
that was in my first year of first
grade and there was these two twins.

219
00:13:48,150 --> 00:13:52,160
All right. And I had a crush on
one of them. Her name was Gwen

220
00:13:53,770 --> 00:13:57,550
and I can't remember the other
one's name. Right. And, uh,

221
00:13:58,660 --> 00:14:01,300
so anyway, I think I might have told
this story before on the podcast. Right.

222
00:14:01,301 --> 00:14:04,780
But so we're fucking, um, Aman,

223
00:14:05,590 --> 00:14:06,730
she's not in my class.

224
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:10,840
I'm in the other class with the sister
and her sister had this giant pink pen.

225
00:14:11,980 --> 00:14:13,960
Like,
I dunno why it was like,

226
00:14:13,990 --> 00:14:18,990
like if it would be like the size of a
number two pencil for like fucking Andre

227
00:14:19,241 --> 00:14:22,630
the giant. I don't know why she had the
giant thing and for whatever reason,

228
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:26,230
you know, I just looked at, I thought,
I dunno, I just looked different.

229
00:14:26,231 --> 00:14:29,140
I thought it was cool. So she dropped
it on the floor and we had like,

230
00:14:29,141 --> 00:14:31,240
all four of our desks were
like made into a circle.

231
00:14:31,250 --> 00:14:34,840
She had like groups of four going around
the teacher and it fell on the fucking

232
00:14:34,841 --> 00:14:37,300
floor.
And um,

233
00:14:38,830 --> 00:14:39,020
okay.

234
00:14:39,020 --> 00:14:43,280
I fucking picked it up. And like
an idiot, this is how dumb I was.

235
00:14:43,281 --> 00:14:45,320
I pick it up and rather
than just stealing it,

236
00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:48,380
I just take it and I
start writing with it.

237
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:51,980
Like in the same fucking circle is her.
So she looks

238
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:55,190
over at me, she goes, hey, that's
my pen. And I go, no, it isn't

239
00:14:56,810 --> 00:15:01,010
like go, it's mine. So this is
where my Jessie's story starts.

240
00:15:01,310 --> 00:15:05,480
If this guy's guilty, right. And
I stick with this fucking story.

241
00:15:05,481 --> 00:15:10,190
She goes up to the teacher and she
goes, Hey, took my pen and I'm going,

242
00:15:10,191 --> 00:15:14,330
no, it's, it's not her pen, it's my
pen. It's a giant pink fucking pen.

243
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:18,830
And the teacher just looks
at me and she goes, you know,

244
00:15:18,860 --> 00:15:22,180
I think it's so and so's pet.
I go, no, it isn't. It's mind.

245
00:15:22,700 --> 00:15:25,880
And then she described this crack that
was in it, like to a t or whatever.

246
00:15:27,350 --> 00:15:30,620
And of course I got busted
and the teacher's just
looking at me like, you know,

247
00:15:31,370 --> 00:15:35,510
look at this little fucking Klepto Ron
Howard looking mother fucker, right?

248
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:39,920
So whatever, you know, you're a little
kid, you blow it off 10 minutes late,

249
00:15:40,010 --> 00:15:42,290
you're probably talking to the person.
You just did that too. But anyways,

250
00:15:42,330 --> 00:15:47,310
so the next day I go to school and
in between, like during the class,

251
00:15:47,390 --> 00:15:49,880
they went to go to the bathroom. It
just so happened that girl, Gwen,

252
00:15:49,881 --> 00:15:52,610
that I had the crush on, she
just looks at me. She goes,

253
00:15:52,670 --> 00:15:54,290
I heard what you did to my sister.

254
00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:57,530
She had this fucking look on her
face that she fucking hated me.

255
00:15:57,830 --> 00:16:02,690
And I just turned around and walked away,
heartbroken to the, uh, to the bathroom,

256
00:16:03,910 --> 00:16:07,130
knowing that the first girl I had a crush
on now knows that I'm a complete piece

257
00:16:07,131 --> 00:16:07,964
of shit.

258
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:11,750
And that was probably the first stepping
stone on me becoming a fucking lonely

259
00:16:11,751 --> 00:16:14,900
comedian. I don't know how
that ties into this, just,

260
00:16:14,901 --> 00:16:19,670
just these small epit this, oh my God,
I can imagine that's a fucking felony.

261
00:16:20,030 --> 00:16:23,030
I didn't know that.
Fake in a police report.

262
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:26,040
I that act and nonetheless,
yeah,

263
00:16:26,170 --> 00:16:30,050
he almost satis speckles
they don't do that.

264
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:32,553
Um,

265
00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:36,410
I guess it makes sense that the cops
would be pissed if you fake something like

266
00:16:36,411 --> 00:16:39,320
all the fucking work they gotta do,
you know what I mean?

267
00:16:39,321 --> 00:16:42,380
Putting this whole goddamn file together
and like this shit doesn't make sense.

268
00:16:43,370 --> 00:16:45,950
It's like haven't write somebody a term
paper for you. And it's like, oh yeah,

269
00:16:45,951 --> 00:16:49,550
yeah, yeah. Just fucking with you.
I'm not going to pay for that. And uh,

270
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:54,350
I'd never really had to do a term paper
and what the fuck was I doing over here

271
00:16:54,351 --> 00:16:58,440
for the last God damn three weeks.
Um,

272
00:16:59,490 --> 00:17:02,820
anyways, I got nothing to talk about.
I am so fucking lonely right now.

273
00:17:02,850 --> 00:17:06,030
It's fucking ridiculous. Um, but my, my,

274
00:17:06,060 --> 00:17:09,780
my wife and kid are going to be flying
out and meeting me soon. I can't wait.

275
00:17:09,781 --> 00:17:14,550
Thank God for facetime. All I do is
sing baby shark. Get my kid going.

276
00:17:14,580 --> 00:17:14,911
You know.

277
00:17:14,911 --> 00:17:18,030
And then it's funny too is
I say this thing like she
always goes push the button,

278
00:17:18,031 --> 00:17:21,510
push the button cause she wants to
hang up. So I just go, don't do it.

279
00:17:21,810 --> 00:17:24,870
Don't push that button.
Don't push that button.

280
00:17:24,871 --> 00:17:29,190
She gets this big grin on her face. She
loves nothing more. And right as I see,

281
00:17:29,250 --> 00:17:32,310
are about ready to laugh. Her face
just disappears and then I become sad.

282
00:17:35,980 --> 00:17:40,830
Anyways, Karl Lagerfeld died
according to the New York Post.

283
00:17:40,890 --> 00:17:42,180
Jesus Christ.
I know that.

284
00:17:42,210 --> 00:17:46,740
How sad and pathetic as this podcast
right now it's saying it's his cat might

285
00:17:46,741 --> 00:17:50,990
get millions. I've be honest,
man. You think I trash fat people?

286
00:17:50,991 --> 00:17:55,100
You should see fucking Karl Lagerfeld,
Lara field, whatever his fucking name is.

287
00:17:56,140 --> 00:17:57,890
Um, he's just of, he was,

288
00:17:57,891 --> 00:18:02,580
I guess he was a fashion giant than he
was very impressed with themselves. Um,

289
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:02,961
all right.

290
00:18:02,961 --> 00:18:07,961
Somebody is about to get a golden litter
box among those who could inherit a big

291
00:18:08,061 --> 00:18:10,980
hunk of the designer.
Carl lager fields are

292
00:18:12,890 --> 00:18:15,770
$125 million fortune is
the love of his life.

293
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:20,860
His celebrity cat,
is it show pay?

294
00:18:20,861 --> 00:18:25,030
Is that how you say his show pet is on
an American would say Cho pet show pay

295
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:27,580
all,
um,

296
00:18:27,670 --> 00:18:32,590
Lagerfeld 85 who died Tuesday in Paris
made it clear in the past that his blue

297
00:18:32,591 --> 00:18:36,650
eyed Berman kitty meant so much to him.
Uh,

298
00:18:36,670 --> 00:18:39,280
that she would find a place in his will.
Yeah.

299
00:18:39,281 --> 00:18:42,100
We probably knew like this
to cats live like 18 years.

300
00:18:42,101 --> 00:18:44,560
You get one when you're 71 or whatever.
Now wait,

301
00:18:44,561 --> 00:18:46,720
he was 85 probably got this
thing when he was like 80.

302
00:18:49,610 --> 00:18:51,860
He's probably be like, well, this
thing is going to get fucking put down.

303
00:18:51,861 --> 00:18:54,620
That's not going to happen. This
guy's a good shit. You know?

304
00:18:54,621 --> 00:18:58,730
I know he trashed fat people in short
men and all of that type of stuff.

305
00:18:58,731 --> 00:19:00,680
I thought he was fucking hilarious.
You know,

306
00:19:00,681 --> 00:19:03,380
there's a few people out there that I
think should have been stand up comedians

307
00:19:03,381 --> 00:19:06,020
instead of what they did,
even though they were wildly successful.

308
00:19:07,310 --> 00:19:09,950
Like both those brothers
that are in oasis.

309
00:19:10,010 --> 00:19:12,770
I half the shit I read that they say,
I like,

310
00:19:12,771 --> 00:19:14,840
this shit's funnier than
anything I've ever fucking said.

311
00:19:15,890 --> 00:19:19,040
These guys really should put down their
fucking Ukuleles and they should go on a

312
00:19:19,041 --> 00:19:23,990
fucking standup tour. I'm not saying they
don't love their music. I'm just saying,

313
00:19:24,710 --> 00:19:28,130
and this Karl Lagerfeld, some of the
shit that this guy said, it's like,

314
00:19:29,030 --> 00:19:33,180
just look up at this
guy's quotes. He was, he,

315
00:19:33,190 --> 00:19:38,050
he was like so fucking
mean. It's funny, you know,

316
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:43,080
unless you live here and
then you're triggered and
then everything needs to stop

317
00:19:44,081 --> 00:19:48,750
and we up the fucking do you know,
I know I have a friend of mine,

318
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:53,750
somebody said to where it
said, uh, you know, hey,

319
00:19:53,751 --> 00:19:56,060
you know I'm really hungry.
I'm going to go get something to eat.

320
00:19:56,061 --> 00:19:58,430
And she wrote back, she goes,
me too. And then she wrote,

321
00:19:58,850 --> 00:20:03,080
not me too with like the Hashtag ha ha ha.
And then the friend got all offended.

322
00:20:03,081 --> 00:20:07,950
Like, that isn't funny. You shouldn't
joke about that. If we joke up,

323
00:20:07,970 --> 00:20:12,620
it's like between each other, you're
fucking idiot. Nothing's happening here.

324
00:20:13,790 --> 00:20:17,600
And she literally had to talk this
person off of a fucking emotional Ed like

325
00:20:17,601 --> 00:20:20,780
ledge. That's where we're at. Okay.

326
00:20:20,810 --> 00:20:22,400
That's where we're at in
this country right now.

327
00:20:22,550 --> 00:20:26,030
And maybe that's why in
this current comedy climate,

328
00:20:26,420 --> 00:20:29,920
somebody like this fucking poor pastor
decided to fucking fake this goddamn

329
00:20:29,930 --> 00:20:31,520
thing, I guess. You know what,

330
00:20:31,521 --> 00:20:34,490
they give you a shit cause they could
actually be out there solving real crimes.

331
00:20:34,491 --> 00:20:37,730
They you go build that only took your
fucking 20 minutes to figure out,

332
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:39,353
okay.

333
00:20:39,860 --> 00:20:42,350
Oh I could have been working
on this domestic violence case,

334
00:20:42,351 --> 00:20:47,351
but I was this and it also probably had
like this high level of like priority.

335
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:49,390
Okay.

336
00:20:49,390 --> 00:20:53,800
Jesus Christ. Is this going to
make a great made for TV movie?

337
00:20:56,370 --> 00:20:57,203
You know what

338
00:20:58,110 --> 00:21:01,020
I think considering magnum P
I's not a white guy anymore.

339
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:05,730
I'm throwing my hat in the ring to play
Jessie Smollett in this, uh, you know,

340
00:21:05,731 --> 00:21:07,980
just a balance shit out.
All right.

341
00:21:10,050 --> 00:21:13,890
If a, why didn't they give one in?
They give magnum a new fucking Ferrari.

342
00:21:13,891 --> 00:21:16,590
Why is he still driving around in that
fucking thing? You know, that's one of,

343
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:18,750
there was one of the worst
Ferrari's ever made. Why can,

344
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:22,830
why can't you give the guy a
nice ride? You know? Does that,

345
00:21:22,831 --> 00:21:27,450
does that make sense to anybody? I was
so far. I mean, I liked it as a nice,

346
00:21:27,451 --> 00:21:30,690
cool that should be like his fucking
weekend driver. You know what I mean?

347
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:35,130
Like that was his high school car. So
he kept it or maybe like, I don't know,

348
00:21:35,610 --> 00:21:39,480
maybe Tom Selleck fucking saved him
from drowning. And when he was a kid,

349
00:21:40,290 --> 00:21:43,560
right after he bang that
chicken, the bikini, you know,
from the opening credits,

350
00:21:44,130 --> 00:21:46,710
then he's like, oh look at this. I was
bagging you hear in the sand and there's,

351
00:21:46,711 --> 00:21:49,530
there's a little fucking kid out.
They're drowning. When are you saved him?

352
00:21:50,820 --> 00:21:55,560
He takes him in now the world don't
move to the beat of just one drum.

353
00:21:55,740 --> 00:21:59,850
We're stuck here on this island,
but we're having fun. Right.

354
00:22:00,900 --> 00:22:03,900
Right in the Ferrari.
You can sit on the fucking console.

355
00:22:04,380 --> 00:22:08,340
Cause I got some hot ass sitting
in the passengers to see, um,

356
00:22:09,180 --> 00:22:12,960
then he could have taken
over the business. Right. You
just have Tom Selleck, uh,

357
00:22:13,860 --> 00:22:18,300
you know, his character dies. It's how I
would've done it. His character is dying.

358
00:22:19,910 --> 00:22:23,300
You know, you make it like
somehow like a hot button issue.

359
00:22:23,330 --> 00:22:27,410
Like he dies of like a, I dunno,
I dunno what prostate can't,

360
00:22:27,411 --> 00:22:32,210
nobody gives a shit about prostate cancer.
He dies of male breast cancer. Okay.

361
00:22:32,630 --> 00:22:33,463
In October.

362
00:22:33,980 --> 00:22:38,930
And the NFL recognizes it by having pink
mustaches put on top of their helmets,

363
00:22:38,931 --> 00:22:41,750
like looking like Lyft drivers.
Okay.

364
00:22:43,830 --> 00:22:48,200
In his dying words or tells this kid to
take over the business and he's like,

365
00:22:48,310 --> 00:22:51,200
and I want you to take care of my
car, make sure she's okay. Right.

366
00:22:51,620 --> 00:22:55,140
So on very special assignments.
No,

367
00:22:55,141 --> 00:22:59,580
whenever he takes a woman out on the
show, you know, I'm sorry, a warrior,

368
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:04,520
a brave, courageous, so brave
to get in those tee tops.

369
00:23:05,370 --> 00:23:08,760
Uh, that t top car and then he just takes
them up at it. But the rest of the show,

370
00:23:08,761 --> 00:23:11,640
he has a brand new fucking Ferrari,
you know,

371
00:23:12,150 --> 00:23:13,560
they chases people down in the street.

372
00:23:13,561 --> 00:23:15,420
And that's how I would've
done it personally.

373
00:23:16,350 --> 00:23:17,183
Okay.

374
00:23:18,490 --> 00:23:22,750
I don't want, I don't want to, you
know, I'm not trashing the show.

375
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:28,270
I'm just saying, you know, it's a network
show. I know you've got the budget.

376
00:23:28,900 --> 00:23:33,030
You could have hooked the guy up with
a new Ferrari. All right. I Dunno.

377
00:23:33,190 --> 00:23:36,380
I'll probably taken all this
shit to fucking seriously. Yeah.

378
00:23:36,410 --> 00:23:38,960
I watched that show is, I didn't know, I
didn't know what was up. What was down.

379
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:43,880
Higgins is a woman now or I, I don't
get it. That's like the new thing.

380
00:23:43,910 --> 00:23:45,470
You just do something that's already done,

381
00:23:45,471 --> 00:23:48,050
but then you just switch everything up.
Yeah.

382
00:23:48,051 --> 00:23:51,170
This used to be a black guy and now
it's a apparent, this was a white guy.

383
00:23:51,171 --> 00:23:54,020
Now he's Puerto Rican. This was
a guy, now it's a woman in a,

384
00:23:54,021 --> 00:23:55,580
it's the same fucking show.

385
00:23:59,060 --> 00:24:00,350
You know what they're doing right now.

386
00:24:00,590 --> 00:24:04,130
They're doing what Hanna Barbera did
with all of their fucking cartoons with

387
00:24:04,940 --> 00:24:06,800
Hanna Barbera. God bless them
because they did Johnny quest,

388
00:24:06,801 --> 00:24:08,630
my favorite fucking cartoon of all time,

389
00:24:08,830 --> 00:24:13,190
but those motherfuckers plagiarize
themselves like 58 fucking times.

390
00:24:14,540 --> 00:24:17,330
They had the Scooby Doo than
they are the Scooby Doo rip off.

391
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:19,940
They had the Flintstones,
which was a rip off of the honeymooners,

392
00:24:19,941 --> 00:24:23,660
and it was just placed in the stone age
and then they did the sort of did the

393
00:24:23,661 --> 00:24:27,410
same fucking show in the
future with the Jetsons.

394
00:24:29,540 --> 00:24:32,600
I forgot. I had this all mapped out,
how they fucking rip themselves off.

395
00:24:32,601 --> 00:24:37,370
And then in the end they combined all of
their characters and had these cartoon

396
00:24:37,371 --> 00:24:41,870
Olympics called the laugh Olympics,
but somewhere. But it was all worth it.

397
00:24:42,830 --> 00:24:46,670
It was all worth it because
of jinx the cat and uh,

398
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:50,960
and Johnny quest. All right.
And with that, let me read a,

399
00:24:52,190 --> 00:24:54,110
let me read this here.
A quip.

400
00:24:54,770 --> 00:24:59,090
One of the most important things we do
for our health everyday is brushing our

401
00:24:59,091 --> 00:25:02,120
teeth.
Yet most of us don't do it properly.

402
00:25:03,230 --> 00:25:06,110
How do you not do it properly? I
mean, it's fucking, it's right there.

403
00:25:07,190 --> 00:25:11,930
Slide your tongue across your teeth. Does
it feel gross? Which one feels gross?

404
00:25:12,370 --> 00:25:17,370
Brushed that one extra quip is a better
electric toothbrush created by dentists

405
00:25:17,570 --> 00:25:22,130
and designers. Finally, they consulted
the dentist. They got the pros in there.

406
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:25,790
Quip was designed to make brushing
your teeth more simple, affordable,

407
00:25:25,791 --> 00:25:27,340
and even enjoyable.
Mm.

408
00:25:27,530 --> 00:25:31,880
I love this sensitive sonic vibrations.
Sorry,

409
00:25:31,940 --> 00:25:33,980
I have to do the sound effects here.
This is a very low budget.

410
00:25:34,190 --> 00:25:36,860
Read gentle enough on your sensitive gums.

411
00:25:37,190 --> 00:25:39,620
Why people brush too hard.

412
00:25:39,621 --> 00:25:44,150
And some electric toothbrushes are too
abrasive. They could explain that better.

413
00:25:44,150 --> 00:25:48,290
If you brushed too hard, you're actually
gonna slowly wear away your gum line,

414
00:25:49,070 --> 00:25:50,570
which is going to lead to a,

415
00:25:50,571 --> 00:25:55,571
a a periodontal issue because what
happens is is that enamel is on the party,

416
00:25:57,020 --> 00:26:01,490
your tooth, that that lives above
the gum. All right below your gum,

417
00:26:01,491 --> 00:26:05,240
it doesn't have any enamel because
it's supposed to be covered by the gum.

418
00:26:05,241 --> 00:26:09,740
It's protected there. So then when
you start brushing too hard, um,

419
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:13,670
you wear that away and eventually that
part gets exposed and it's way more

420
00:26:13,671 --> 00:26:17,600
susceptible to tooth decay.
Then what happens is eventually you're,

421
00:26:17,601 --> 00:26:21,710
you're looking at a crown or a root
canal or God forbid you lose a tooth.

422
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:24,050
Now when you lose a tooth,
okay,

423
00:26:24,051 --> 00:26:27,590
you have to go to the fucking dentist and
you have to get something put in there

424
00:26:27,591 --> 00:26:28,910
because what happens is,

425
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:33,590
is the teeth next to it move to the side
to try to close up the space and the

426
00:26:33,591 --> 00:26:38,591
tooth directly below it will erupt upwards
to fill in that fucking space to help

427
00:26:39,801 --> 00:26:42,360
fill it in. And then when it
erupts upwards, you got that party,

428
00:26:42,361 --> 00:26:45,990
a tooth that doesn't have an AML on it
and that's exposed and then you lose that

429
00:26:45,991 --> 00:26:48,630
fucking tooth and then everybody
starts fucking moving around.

430
00:26:50,350 --> 00:26:53,080
It's a fucking shit show.
You know what it's like.

431
00:26:53,081 --> 00:26:55,840
You ever seen those special
forces when they, they,

432
00:26:55,850 --> 00:27:00,130
they got a hold the fucking log up to
become like an army ranger and have one

433
00:27:00,131 --> 00:27:03,730
guy fucking quits.
Then they all the other fucking guys,

434
00:27:03,850 --> 00:27:06,790
then they have to hold his weight
up. They don't get to quit, right?

435
00:27:08,050 --> 00:27:10,900
It's kind of the same thing.
But anyways,

436
00:27:10,901 --> 00:27:14,980
it's a built in two minute timer that
pulses every 30 seconds to remind you when

437
00:27:14,981 --> 00:27:16,240
to switch sides,

438
00:27:17,020 --> 00:27:22,000
helping guide of full and even clean so
you can be an absolute fucking moron and

439
00:27:22,001 --> 00:27:26,530
do it properly. Uh, up to 90% of us
don't brush for a full two minutes.

440
00:27:26,660 --> 00:27:30,280
I guess. I don't, I guess I'm
a moron or don't clean evenly.

441
00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:35,520
A multiuse cover mounts to your mirror
and amounts to slide over your bristles a

442
00:27:36,580 --> 00:27:39,730
for on the go. Brushing.
Say why you love quip.

443
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:44,710
I love quip cause they're paying me
to say it. That's why I love quip. No,

444
00:27:44,711 --> 00:27:46,260
I love anything,
anybody to be honest with you.

445
00:27:46,261 --> 00:27:47,740
Anybody that's helping you
take care of your teeth.

446
00:27:47,890 --> 00:27:50,860
It's the number one fucking thing.
So number one goddamn thing,

447
00:27:50,861 --> 00:27:55,090
you take care of your teeth like I like
what you're going to do for yourself in

448
00:27:55,091 --> 00:27:58,840
life. All right? You chew
your food properly. You don't
have your fucking teeth,

449
00:27:58,990 --> 00:28:02,410
you're not going to do that. It leads to
stomach problems, leads the gun problems.

450
00:28:02,411 --> 00:28:04,890
Then you got problems in your
ass and next thing you know,

451
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:07,600
if people are coming by on your deathbed,
all right?

452
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:09,010
Or You could just buy this toothbrush.

453
00:28:09,430 --> 00:28:13,240
That's why I love quip and why
they're backed by over 20,000 dental

454
00:28:13,241 --> 00:28:16,720

that I had to talk about? Um,

463

tonight I will be a,

464
00:28:55,061 --> 00:28:59,650
I'll be at the west side comedy club
doing a little bit of time. Nothing crazy,

465
00:28:59,651 --> 00:29:03,310
but I'm just going to be doing my set
until I fly over to jolly old England.

466
00:29:03,940 --> 00:29:07,540
Make sure it's ready to go. And uh,
I'm starting to get butterflies, man.

467
00:29:07,541 --> 00:29:09,280
I'm might go almost a week out.

468
00:29:09,790 --> 00:29:14,790
Monday will be a week out and I'm getting
ready to take this thing and I am very

469
00:29:17,020 --> 00:29:17,853
,

470
00:29:18,660 --> 00:29:18,750
uh,

471
00:29:18,750 --> 00:29:23,100
anxious to do it in a good way. I'm
nervous, but in a good way. And um,

472
00:29:24,380 --> 00:29:25,820
I dunno, I can't, can't fucking wait.

473
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:28,940
CanNot fucking wait and I'm
gonna run the set tonight.

474
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:33,350
What else did I want to talk
about? Ah, fuck. I just had it.

475
00:29:34,730 --> 00:29:37,220
See that you haven't and it
just goes away. You know why?

476
00:29:37,430 --> 00:29:38,630
Cause I don't brush properly.

477
00:29:40,030 --> 00:29:42,580
If I did two total when I brushed,

478
00:29:43,660 --> 00:29:47,930
my brain wouldn't be fucking mush,
I guess. I have no fucking idea. Um,

479
00:29:49,410 --> 00:29:51,360
anyways, it was fucking hilarious.
It's not really hilarious.

480
00:29:51,361 --> 00:29:54,420
I was walking up the street and I was in
a good mood and shit and there was this

481
00:29:54,421 --> 00:29:57,780
homeless person and she goes,
can you spare some change or whatever?

482
00:29:57,781 --> 00:29:59,910
And I was like, yeah, I can. So I
suppose that might give a change.

483
00:29:59,911 --> 00:30:03,890
I don't have any change. I'll give a
dollar. So as I was reaching in to, uh,

484
00:30:03,990 --> 00:30:05,580
give our dollar, I would, I, you know,

485
00:30:05,610 --> 00:30:08,160
I felt weird because I was just standing
there. So I was just like, hey, you know,

486
00:30:08,161 --> 00:30:11,660
how's it going?
I said,

487
00:30:11,661 --> 00:30:15,320
how's it go into a fucking homeless
person? And she just answered me honestly.

488
00:30:15,321 --> 00:30:18,530
She's like, well, I'm living in a shelter.
My Dad died. And I was like, all right.

489
00:30:18,531 --> 00:30:23,430
All right. Dumb question.
Kind of a fucking idiot in
my, you know, so how are you,

490
00:30:23,670 --> 00:30:25,730
that's all I enjoy living on the street.

491
00:30:27,010 --> 00:30:28,590
Did everything you thought
it was going to be?

492
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:34,820
Nope.
I don't really think when I speak before,

493
00:30:34,821 --> 00:30:38,000
I speak a lot of the times and then I
say it. And as it's coming up, I'm like,

494
00:30:38,001 --> 00:30:40,110
why did I say that?
You know?

495
00:30:40,460 --> 00:30:43,130
But the good thing that I
have is I know I'm a moron.

496
00:30:43,370 --> 00:30:47,120
I like to think this is one of my
better qualities is I know I'm a moron.

497
00:30:47,420 --> 00:30:50,720
So as the person is fucking saying,
why did you say that?

498
00:30:50,721 --> 00:30:53,300
I'm already agreeing with them. Like
I know, you're right. You're right.

499
00:30:54,050 --> 00:30:58,700
I was stupid. So anyways, um, I hoped this

500
00:31:00,470 --> 00:31:03,950
Jesse Smollett guy somehow makes
it come back. If this is all true,

501
00:31:04,310 --> 00:31:07,160
Ilb makes a comeback from this fucking
shit. Jesus Christ. You hate to see.

502
00:31:07,161 --> 00:31:11,450
I hate to see it. You hate to see it.
I've seen other people do shit like this.

503
00:31:12,140 --> 00:31:13,790
It's just, I just, you fucking,

504
00:31:15,260 --> 00:31:17,210
it's so fucking embarrassing.

505
00:31:21,420 --> 00:31:24,420
It's fucking crazy to
take it to that lack of,

506
00:31:24,540 --> 00:31:27,270
see if you just did this
amongst your friends, you know,

507
00:31:27,540 --> 00:31:30,060
just tired one of your friends to punch
you in the lip and then you walk into a

508
00:31:30,061 --> 00:31:33,360
party got jumped. But I fought him
off. Oh my God, he's so heroic.

509
00:31:33,540 --> 00:31:36,120
And next thing you know,
you're getting blown. You know,

510
00:31:37,320 --> 00:31:41,110
I can see the method of that madness, but
to take it to this fucking level, you,

511
00:31:41,460 --> 00:31:45,870
you get to these fucking had gig come
over the little fucking little brush,

512
00:31:45,910 --> 00:31:48,660
they start Dustin. Shit.
It's all gonna fall apart.

513
00:31:49,730 --> 00:31:54,370
There's security cameras.
You can't get away with shit.

514
00:31:54,371 --> 00:31:55,560
And now all these fucking people,

515
00:31:55,710 --> 00:31:58,390
they're sending their DNA into these
goddamn things. It's, it's, it's,

516
00:31:58,470 --> 00:32:01,880
it's a fucking rep.
It's a fucking rep.

517
00:32:03,370 --> 00:32:07,090
Put my man, man voice back
on here. It is a fucking rap.

518
00:32:07,091 --> 00:32:10,300
You're not going to be able to do shit.
And I'm not,

519
00:32:10,330 --> 00:32:12,840
I'm not defended people doing
really crazy shit, but I mean,

520
00:32:12,850 --> 00:32:16,980
you're not gonna be able do shit. You
know what I mean? Steal a Christmas tree

521
00:32:18,670 --> 00:32:20,300
sophomore at shit.
Right.

522
00:32:22,260 --> 00:32:26,550
Go around knocking people's fucking
mailboxes off with a baseball bat.

523
00:32:26,700 --> 00:32:29,280
Stupid Shit. Yeah, none of
that. It's all going to be,

524
00:32:29,281 --> 00:32:31,380
there'll be a fucking
drone following you around.

525
00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:33,600
Somebody had some in the future.
I swear to God,

526
00:32:33,601 --> 00:32:36,300
these robots are going to show up with a
little dusty fucking things that matter

527
00:32:36,301 --> 00:32:40,070
what, no matter what
you do, you are at that

528
00:32:40,070 --> 00:32:44,570
parking meter for all for 30 seconds more.
Here is your ticket.

529
00:32:45,230 --> 00:32:49,130
But I got out of there before a cop
came. Shut up. We will eliminate you.

530
00:32:50,360 --> 00:32:54,770
Speaking of elimination, the first
mammal, I don't even know what it was.

531
00:32:54,771 --> 00:32:58,610
This little field mouse became
extinct because of global warming.

532
00:32:58,611 --> 00:33:02,960
Cumin caused global fucking warming.
Ah.

533
00:33:03,260 --> 00:33:06,470
Was the news going to talk about that?
I going to talk about that,

534
00:33:07,370 --> 00:33:11,840
that I talk about it. Nah, talking
about it in the end. I Dunno.

535
00:33:11,900 --> 00:33:15,470
I Dunno what the fucking solution is,
but I do know this.

536
00:33:15,471 --> 00:33:18,260
When the water rises
up your flat screen TV,

537
00:33:18,350 --> 00:33:22,890
you better get some flotation
devices for it. You know, you know,

538
00:33:22,980 --> 00:33:24,770
it was gonna survive all the
people that live in the middle,

539
00:33:25,700 --> 00:33:29,090
middle of the country. As the water rises
up, they're going to fucking survive.

540
00:33:29,780 --> 00:33:30,350
You know?

541
00:33:30,350 --> 00:33:32,870
And that's going to be hilarious watching
all the liberals who think they're so

542
00:33:32,871 --> 00:33:37,040
fucking smart running from for the
fucking oceans rising. You know,

543
00:33:37,210 --> 00:33:41,330
they're trying to hang out with all these,
get her done fucking people. All right.

544
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:45,020
That's a reality show that I,
that's not going to have to be scripted.

545
00:33:47,060 --> 00:33:49,910
Um, anyways, why do I end up at such
dark shit? I always do this one.

546
00:33:49,911 --> 00:33:52,010
I'm fucking alone. I just started
thinking about the end of the world,

547
00:33:52,660 --> 00:33:55,880
I guess I just saying I missed my family.
All right, I'm going to stop babbling.

548
00:33:56,570 --> 00:34:00,350
Um, God bless all of you. Enjoy
your weekend. You fucking cunts.

549
00:34:00,830 --> 00:34:04,550
And I will, uh, I will check
it on your argus. I Dunno.

550
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:08,210
I'll do another fucking Monday
morning podcast as I do.

551
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:11,480
I've got to figure out when to do it.
I don't know where I'll be.

552
00:34:11,481 --> 00:34:13,970
I think I'll be in England by then.
Who knows?

553
00:34:13,971 --> 00:34:18,350
Maybe I'll put on a phony accent
for you, Huh? Feel you deserve it.

554
00:34:18,860 --> 00:34:21,890
Kidding? Of course. All right.
That's it. Please enjoy the music.

555
00:34:21,891 --> 00:34:25,070
And then we have another half hour of a
Thursday afternoon just before Friday.

556
00:34:25,071 --> 00:34:29,000
Monday morning podcast, greatest
hit episode. All right, that's it.

557
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:16,100
[inaudible] [inaudible]

558
00:35:16,100 --> 00:35:16,940
hey,
what's going on?

559
00:35:16,941 --> 00:35:20,180
It's pilfer and it is the Monday
morning podcasts for Monday,

560
00:35:20,270 --> 00:35:23,600
February 21st,

561
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:26,270
2011 I can't say that 2011,

562
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:31,480
2011 I fucking tongue gets
stuck to the roof of my mouth.

563
00:35:32,030 --> 00:35:36,710
2011 say, um,

564
00:35:36,711 --> 00:35:41,700
yes. What is up? It's Sunday afternoon.
I am doing this podcast because I, I am,

565
00:35:41,701 --> 00:35:45,540
I am committed to finally getting these
things up Monday morning all around the

566
00:35:45,541 --> 00:35:48,600
world. Unless you live in
Japan, but if you live in Japan,

567
00:35:48,601 --> 00:35:52,040
you can't understand what the fuck I'm
saying unless you're a US troop and

568
00:35:52,130 --> 00:35:53,940
you're stationed over there.
At which point,

569
00:35:54,090 --> 00:35:58,320
I don't know what the fuck to tell you.
All right, what am I supposed to do?

570
00:35:58,321 --> 00:36:01,470
Nobody in Australia complaints
and there's 17 hours ahead of me.

571
00:36:01,620 --> 00:36:05,190
So stand down son.
Um,

572
00:36:06,090 --> 00:36:09,840
I have a big day ahead of me.
The NBA, all star game is, is,

573
00:36:10,410 --> 00:36:12,780
is fucking at the staple center,

574
00:36:14,610 --> 00:36:18,420
Staples Center home of the Los Angeles
Lakers and they're 11 championship

575
00:36:18,421 --> 00:36:22,110
banners and then that one banner
with all those ones from the BBA.

576
00:36:26,370 --> 00:36:30,660
So anyways, you gotta be
saying to yourself, hey bill,
you're a big sports fan.

577
00:36:30,690 --> 00:36:33,360
Are you going to go to the game?
Yes I am.

578
00:36:34,680 --> 00:36:36,000
I am going to go to the game.

579
00:36:36,001 --> 00:36:38,820
Can you fucking believe it
kind of came out of nowhere.

580
00:36:38,821 --> 00:36:40,200
All of a sudden I had a hookup.

581
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:44,850
Somebody came through with the ticket
and I said, apps a Fuckin lutely.

582
00:36:44,851 --> 00:36:48,270
Somebody I know came through with the
fucking ticket for the entire all star

583
00:36:48,271 --> 00:36:53,010
weekend yesterday for the three point
contest and the dunking contest.

584
00:36:53,011 --> 00:36:57,750
He said, it starts at five 30 I'm like,
fuck, I'm flying back from New Jersey.

585
00:36:58,410 --> 00:37:01,710
I land right about six and the
guy's like, oh, just come on over.

586
00:37:01,711 --> 00:37:04,230
You'll get to catch the last
half of it. I said, great.

587
00:37:05,490 --> 00:37:10,490
I go to get on my flight chief
and he very full flight people.

588
00:37:10,531 --> 00:37:12,540
If you could not stand in the aisle,

589
00:37:12,570 --> 00:37:16,740
could you just can't find you sheets
so we can expedite the fucking playable

590
00:37:16,990 --> 00:37:20,280
blow of the turmeric and I'm sitting there
going, let's go. People fuck them on.

591
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:24,000
Sit down, sit down. Let's go. I finally
got a hookup. Let's do something.

592
00:37:25,260 --> 00:37:26,970
Let's get this bitch off the ground.
And one of the,

593
00:37:27,180 --> 00:37:29,340
what's the first thing that they say?
I'm praying,

594
00:37:30,570 --> 00:37:35,430
praying for a nice 200 mile an hour
tail wind or whatever the fuck I need to

595
00:37:35,431 --> 00:37:38,820
shave off a half hour. This son of a
bitch. And what do they say? They say,

596
00:37:38,821 --> 00:37:43,470
we haven't very phone flight and a
captain got on and he starts talking about

597
00:37:43,471 --> 00:37:48,471
how there's some fucking biblical level
headwind that's going to slow down the

598
00:37:49,111 --> 00:37:53,910
plane, but we can try and make up the time
at a different altitude. Didn't happen.

599
00:37:55,320 --> 00:37:55,861
They always stay.

600
00:37:55,861 --> 00:37:59,850
We say that this fucking flight is going
to be about six hours and 15 minutes,

601
00:38:00,450 --> 00:38:01,470
all right?
It doesn't take,

602
00:38:01,471 --> 00:38:05,310
that takes about five and a half hours
with a usual goddamn headwind. Okay?

603
00:38:05,310 --> 00:38:09,840
But they say six hours and 15 minutes
just in case there's a delay, you know,

604
00:38:09,841 --> 00:38:11,340
take off or landing or whatever.

605
00:38:11,341 --> 00:38:14,190
They can still say that they're
on time and if there's no delay,

606
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:17,490
then they can be like, Eh, we got
you in here about 20 minutes early.

607
00:38:17,970 --> 00:38:20,700
Like we can't do the fucking math.
Like we don't know what they're doing.

608
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:26,430
So it turns out this is fucking insane
headwind and an ends up taking seven

609
00:38:26,580 --> 00:38:31,140
fucking hours to get to lax.
And by the time I landed,

610
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:34,080
I didn't even want to go.
I didn't even give a shit.

611
00:38:34,081 --> 00:38:37,930
My fucking knees were fucking
behind my shoulders at that point.

612
00:38:37,931 --> 00:38:42,610
Just cramped in there, you know an
idea. I said, fine, I'll gives a shit.

613
00:38:43,850 --> 00:38:47,890
You know that Dunkin contest.
I can watch all of that on Youtube,

614
00:38:47,891 --> 00:38:52,420
but I'm still going to the
fucking game. Um, and I'm psyched.

615
00:38:52,810 --> 00:38:56,050
I've never been to an all star
game before. Never ever, ever.

616
00:38:56,170 --> 00:38:58,890
And I'm psyched to stand there
and look at all the celebrities.

617
00:38:59,020 --> 00:39:02,530
They're going to be there
and all their bitches. Huh?

618
00:39:02,590 --> 00:39:04,810
I don't want to see the wives.
I want to see that bitches.

619
00:39:04,811 --> 00:39:09,460
I want to see they a gold digger and
fucking whores. That's what I want to see.

620
00:39:09,820 --> 00:39:12,940
Fuck the NBA players.
I don't give a shit about them.

621
00:39:14,840 --> 00:39:17,590
Bunch of Goddamn Weirdos. You're all
six foot 10. You should be able to dunk.

622
00:39:18,150 --> 00:39:20,410
All right?
And you look weird in street clothes.

623
00:39:20,700 --> 00:39:24,130
Do you ever see an NBA player in a suit?
You know,

624
00:39:24,250 --> 00:39:28,270
we looks like that they have like giantism
of something. They don't look right.

625
00:39:28,390 --> 00:39:32,410
They don't look right unless they're in
a tank top and shorts standing next to

626
00:39:32,411 --> 00:39:34,540
another guy who's also
six foot fucking tents.

627
00:39:34,541 --> 00:39:37,570
I don't give a shit about those guys.
They don't give a fuck about me, right?

628
00:39:38,230 --> 00:39:41,290
I'm there to see the gold digging whores.

629
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:45,220
I want to see that whole
fucking game going down.

630
00:39:46,210 --> 00:39:50,620
Right? Okay. It's the All Star Games.
You know all these celebrities.

631
00:39:50,621 --> 00:39:53,710
They got to bring their bottom bitch to
that one. They got to bring their wife.

632
00:39:54,130 --> 00:39:55,690
They got to bring this serious girlfriend.

633
00:39:55,691 --> 00:39:59,780
That's what the fuck they
have to bring. All right. The,

634
00:39:59,790 --> 00:40:02,550
she's in the pride,
but on the outside,

635
00:40:02,840 --> 00:40:05,640
little fucking hyenas trying to
steal a little piece of meat, right?

636
00:40:06,060 --> 00:40:08,280
That's going to be all the
horse. That's the game. That's,

637
00:40:08,340 --> 00:40:10,200
that's the fucking game
I'm going to be watching.

638
00:40:10,890 --> 00:40:15,890
I want to see what ridiculous fucking
outfit the gold dig and horror is.

639
00:40:17,321 --> 00:40:22,120
Gonna is gonna fucking be wearing the
length that she's going to have to go to.

640
00:40:23,770 --> 00:40:27,490
To get this,
these fucking multimillionaires,

641
00:40:28,450 --> 00:40:33,340
to notice him right in front of their
fucking wife. I can't wait. I cannot wait.

642
00:40:34,600 --> 00:40:38,800
You know what? I got an idea. How about
it takes some pictures. I'll take some

643
00:40:39,690 --> 00:40:42,690
do that. That goes against everything
that I'm about. I can't fucking do.

644
00:40:42,691 --> 00:40:46,020
I can't rat out people. I can't wait.
That's what, that's what I want to see.

645
00:40:46,680 --> 00:40:51,640
I want to see that and absolutely no
defense. You know, one 72, one 68 games.

646
00:40:51,720 --> 00:40:55,320
It's going to be fucking awesome.
I can't wait and uh, and that's it.

647
00:40:55,321 --> 00:40:59,880
So believe it or not, I'm actually in
a great mood. I had an awesome weekend.

648
00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:04,950
I have no funny stories to tell
everything. Everything worked out.

649
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:09,840
I did the Tarrytown, a music
hall and Tarrytown, New York.

650
00:41:10,380 --> 00:41:11,510
Beautiful,
beautiful,

651
00:41:11,790 --> 00:41:14,910
full, lovely, safe, creepy, scary

652
00:41:16,970 --> 00:41:21,260
white is fucking town ever. You guys
ever been to West Chester, New York?

653
00:41:21,890 --> 00:41:24,590
There is a level of wealth,

654
00:41:25,850 --> 00:41:30,850
a level of whiteness and a level of
overall piece yet unbelievable fucking

655
00:41:34,790 --> 00:41:38,690
to that part of the country. I can
see. I'm tried. I tried to explain.

656
00:41:38,691 --> 00:41:41,010
I was talking about it on
stage and people were laughing.

657
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:44,180
I couldn't tell if they were just laughing
because I was in that town making fun

658
00:41:44,181 --> 00:41:48,840
of it. But like Terry towns,
like ridiculous. It's like,

659
00:41:50,150 --> 00:41:50,350
yeah,

660
00:41:50,350 --> 00:41:53,790
these, these, I mean you could
shoot a period piece there,

661
00:41:53,940 --> 00:41:57,300
some Charles Dickens novel. If you
ever wanted to turn it into a movie,

662
00:41:57,930 --> 00:42:02,280
you could very easily just remove all
the cars and just dress everybody up.

663
00:42:02,281 --> 00:42:06,590
Like it was a 17 or 18 hundreds and just
have them going up the street and a God

664
00:42:06,900 --> 00:42:08,580
damn horse. It wouldn't be a
fucking problem. Put it this way,

665
00:42:08,700 --> 00:42:13,530
the next town over is sleepy hollow.
All right. Headless Horseman Shit. Okay.

666
00:42:13,531 --> 00:42:17,020
And right next to that is
the Hudson River. All right.

667
00:42:17,021 --> 00:42:20,950
And which is eerily quiet at
night and a little bit south.

668
00:42:21,060 --> 00:42:24,280
You've got the Tappan Zee bridge, the
whole thing. It looks like you're on.

669
00:42:24,281 --> 00:42:27,700
You feel like you're on a movie set.
That's what I was joking about,

670
00:42:27,701 --> 00:42:31,540
that everything just felt so wonderful,
peaceful and safe.

671
00:42:31,541 --> 00:42:34,510
And you felt every time
you turned a corner,

672
00:42:35,260 --> 00:42:38,590
you felt that there was just going to
be like a hundred zombies just standing

673
00:42:38,591 --> 00:42:41,170
there and then they'd look at
you. You know, when they get that,

674
00:42:41,171 --> 00:42:44,830
that excitement that they see fresh meat
and I don't really happen to zombies,

675
00:42:44,831 --> 00:42:46,240
but all of a sudden they can run now,

676
00:42:46,241 --> 00:42:49,990
which is pretty fucking awesome unless
you're getting chased by one. Um,

677
00:42:51,040 --> 00:42:55,450
that was the vibe of, of, uh, of
Terry town. But I went in and I did,

678
00:42:55,600 --> 00:42:59,620
did my show. And you gotta understand
like I did that theater like five,

679
00:42:59,621 --> 00:43:04,450
six years ago as part of a tour
for the Montreal comedy festival.

680
00:43:04,451 --> 00:43:09,100
And I was on that tour with like,
like six or seven other comedians.

681
00:43:09,101 --> 00:43:10,900
So all I got to do is like 15 minutes.

682
00:43:10,901 --> 00:43:14,020
And I remember I was excited then
to be doing it. And you know,

683
00:43:15,040 --> 00:43:16,210
you start thinking like,
man,

684
00:43:16,211 --> 00:43:21,010
am I ever going to be able to play this
place on my own? It was fucking awesome.

685
00:43:21,880 --> 00:43:23,650
They showed up and the place was packed.

686
00:43:24,340 --> 00:43:27,670
And then the next night was,
uh,

687
00:43:28,210 --> 00:43:32,620
the count Basie theater in Red Bank,
New Jersey. And that place was gigantic.

688
00:43:33,250 --> 00:43:35,260
And the second, you know, we booked it.

689
00:43:35,261 --> 00:43:37,740
I was paranoid that they're going to
have to cancel it or I don't want you to

690
00:43:37,741 --> 00:43:42,550
only be like half fucking full. And that
one ended up fucking selling out. And, uh,

691
00:43:43,300 --> 00:43:48,220
so I just want to thank everybody and
creepy ass Tarrytown, sleepy hollow,

692
00:43:49,480 --> 00:43:52,880
Westchester County who
showed up to my gig. Um,

693
00:43:53,110 --> 00:43:56,350
and everybody out in New Jersey now,
people fucking sleep on New Jersey,

694
00:43:56,351 --> 00:43:58,530
by the way,
you know,

695
00:43:58,770 --> 00:44:02,040
because all they do is they come out of
Manhattan and they jump on the Jersey

696
00:44:02,041 --> 00:44:06,120
turnpike and they see all those
chemical fucking plants and uh,

697
00:44:06,180 --> 00:44:08,880
they just think it's, it's a
shit hole. But I'm telling you,

698
00:44:08,881 --> 00:44:12,420
there's some absolutely gorgeous
parts of it. And Red Bank,

699
00:44:12,421 --> 00:44:15,450
New Jersey was one of them.
Like I saw,

700
00:44:15,520 --> 00:44:19,560
have you ever seen what a $20 million
home looks like? You know, live.

701
00:44:19,590 --> 00:44:21,190
I've never seen it. It's, it's it.

702
00:44:22,710 --> 00:44:27,710
It's like these fucking people
live in houses as big as schools

703
00:44:29,270 --> 00:44:29,780
and you know,

704
00:44:29,780 --> 00:44:33,510
and as much as they were beautiful
and as much as I was in awe of them,

705
00:44:33,540 --> 00:44:36,770
I just remember thinking,
how could you possibly do,

706
00:44:36,840 --> 00:44:41,690
have done anything remotely legal
together, that fucking house,

707
00:44:42,680 --> 00:44:46,400
you know, I'm telling you, I swear to God,

708
00:44:47,480 --> 00:44:52,340
I bet 90% of them were
bankers and people in finance.

709
00:44:53,500 --> 00:44:56,530
I'm telling you.
And then the other will be like the,

710
00:44:56,560 --> 00:45:01,540
Oh that guy created a then the mutant
Ninja turtles or something huge.

711
00:45:01,780 --> 00:45:05,650
But other than that,
if you're just a regular fucking person,

712
00:45:06,040 --> 00:45:08,350
the only way to make that
kind of fucking money

713
00:45:10,220 --> 00:45:14,790
is you've got to be in banking.
Fucking genius.

714
00:45:15,300 --> 00:45:18,180
Whoever came up with the idea of a bank,
hey everybody,

715
00:45:18,181 --> 00:45:21,820
you guys work all week and then you
give you money to me. All right.

716
00:45:22,030 --> 00:45:26,400
Then I'll pull it all together and I'll
loan it back to yet interest and then

717
00:45:26,401 --> 00:45:29,850
you give me more money on that while
you continue to give me all your other

718
00:45:29,851 --> 00:45:32,880
money every fucking week.
Don't worry, I'll keep it safe.

719
00:45:34,220 --> 00:45:37,010
You piece of shit, motherfucker.
You fucking kidding me.

720
00:45:39,240 --> 00:45:42,150
Well, how do you justify, how do
you earn enough fucking money?

721
00:45:43,320 --> 00:45:43,580
Yeah,

722
00:45:43,580 --> 00:45:48,440
I could see if Derek Jeter add one
of those houses, I get it. I get it.

723
00:45:49,130 --> 00:45:54,090
He fucking shows up to a stadium and
60,000 people show up. What do you think?

724
00:45:54,091 --> 00:45:55,950
What would have happened if they said,
hey,

725
00:45:55,951 --> 00:45:58,350
a bankers giving a
lecture at Yankee Stadium?

726
00:45:58,351 --> 00:46:03,020
How many fucking people you think
would show up fucking asshole?

727
00:46:03,021 --> 00:46:05,210
He probably couldn't even
fill up the stress factory.

728
00:46:07,010 --> 00:46:07,843
You know?

729
00:46:10,470 --> 00:46:13,670
That's what I swear to God. That's,
that's, that's my feeling when, when I,

730
00:46:13,690 --> 00:46:17,340
the few times that I've gotten
into those types of areas,

731
00:46:17,341 --> 00:46:22,341
I drive by them and I am in absolute
fucking are of the level of wealth.

732
00:46:24,090 --> 00:46:26,670
And then that's immediately what I think.
Like there's no fucking way,

733
00:46:27,630 --> 00:46:30,120
there's no legal fucking way to do this.

734
00:46:32,150 --> 00:46:32,983
You know,

735
00:46:34,480 --> 00:46:39,100
take it from me, take it from me.
I'm doing all right now. You know,

736
00:46:39,101 --> 00:46:40,640
selling out theaters.
Let me,

737
00:46:40,670 --> 00:46:44,050
you should see the laws that they have
to make sure that I don't get rich.

738
00:46:45,040 --> 00:46:49,240
They are just, they're taking a
fucking machete to my knees right now.

739
00:46:50,860 --> 00:46:54,970
When we do an impression of my, of me
talking to my accountant every quarter,

740
00:46:55,880 --> 00:47:00,730
what do you gotta be? You know,
sat to this fucking country that,

741
00:47:00,760 --> 00:47:03,170
that's 0.3 seconds.

742
00:47:06,770 --> 00:47:09,350
But I get it. I get it. We're
fighting to fucking wars.

743
00:47:09,770 --> 00:47:11,990
Somebody's got to pay for it and
it can be those rich [inaudible]

744
00:47:13,580 --> 00:47:17,750
Jesus fucking Christ.
Anyways,

745
00:47:19,370 --> 00:47:21,680
the fuck was I talking about? Yeah. You
know what it's like. It's like that,

746
00:47:21,681 --> 00:47:23,900
that president over there in Egypt,
you know,

747
00:47:25,430 --> 00:47:26,870
he was like a bank.

748
00:47:27,200 --> 00:47:31,510
He had all their fucking money and it
was just sitting there. He took it.

749
00:47:31,570 --> 00:47:34,720
Of course he took it, you know
something. I'm not even mad at bankers.

750
00:47:34,721 --> 00:47:38,810
I'm not even fucking mad at him because
I think, well, I don't know. I can't,

751
00:47:38,811 --> 00:47:42,160
I can't say money.
That isn't the thing that gets me going.

752
00:47:43,930 --> 00:47:47,560
Women, I would say that you
got to pick your weakness.

753
00:47:47,560 --> 00:47:51,490
Some people you'll weaknesses money.
Some people, your weakness, his power.

754
00:47:52,120 --> 00:47:54,650
Mine is the fucking Bra.

755
00:47:56,470 --> 00:47:57,490
I'll tell you right now,

756
00:47:58,870 --> 00:48:03,220
if making people laugh ever gets me
to the level of being a dictator,

757
00:48:03,250 --> 00:48:07,570
there is no fucking way I'm going to be
able to remain faithful. I will have,

758
00:48:07,571 --> 00:48:12,400
who is, do you understand me? People I
will have fucking who was listening to me.

759
00:48:12,520 --> 00:48:15,940
I'm going to the fucking NBA All
star game tonight. All right. And

760
00:48:17,530 --> 00:48:17,920
um,
it's,

761
00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:22,920
I'm more excited to see the level of
gold digging fucking whore that's gonna

762
00:48:23,140 --> 00:48:27,850
show up the temptresses I can't wait.

763
00:48:28,480 --> 00:48:33,480
I cannot fucking wait to see how high up
you have to Jackie a fucking ass up to

764
00:48:34,691 --> 00:48:36,970
get noticed at the all star game.
Cause you know,

765
00:48:36,971 --> 00:48:40,020
every horror out there is she's
going with the fucking four,

766
00:48:40,030 --> 00:48:43,930
five inch Goddamn stilettos.
Ah,

767
00:48:45,270 --> 00:48:49,410
walking down those, those, those fucking,
you know, they're all going to be sitting,

768
00:48:49,770 --> 00:48:54,630
you know, where did gold digging whores
sit? The wives sit court side, they sit,

769
00:48:54,840 --> 00:48:55,673
they sit in a group.

770
00:48:55,760 --> 00:48:59,010
You've ever noticed that they all
keep the wives all you know, together.

771
00:48:59,220 --> 00:49:00,870
It's a very smart move by the men,
you know,

772
00:49:00,990 --> 00:49:02,070
cause you got a bunch of women together.

773
00:49:02,310 --> 00:49:04,590
Eventually they're just going
to be running their mouths.

774
00:49:04,591 --> 00:49:06,980
They're not gonna be paying
attention to shit. I don't

775
00:49:09,060 --> 00:49:11,250
think we doing that shit while
the fucking games going on.

776
00:49:11,251 --> 00:49:15,360
They don't give a shit, right.
I'd say the gold digging whores.

777
00:49:16,490 --> 00:49:17,000
Yeah.

778
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:22,000
I'm going to say that they're going to
start at about row about 20 maybe 21 it's

779
00:49:24,380 --> 00:49:28,040
a more believable number,
right? 20 was to even, you know,

780
00:49:28,930 --> 00:49:32,450
wrote 23 that's where they're
going to start. All right,

781
00:49:32,990 --> 00:49:37,460
and that's going to be like
the gold digging whores,

782
00:49:37,490 --> 00:49:41,480
gold digging whore. You know what I
mean? Like the quarterback, quarterback,

783
00:49:41,481 --> 00:49:42,560
the comic's comic,

784
00:49:43,220 --> 00:49:48,220
the whores whore is going to be
at the NBA All star game already.

785
00:49:48,590 --> 00:49:52,010
Bang in.
Somebody's already hooked up.

786
00:49:53,030 --> 00:49:56,950
She's going to be about road 20 right?
She's already gonna have guilted.

787
00:49:56,960 --> 00:50:01,190
Somebody down there,
somebody connected that you know,

788
00:50:01,220 --> 00:50:05,050
how come your wife is sitting?
Seven rows in front of me and Aa.

789
00:50:05,060 --> 00:50:09,410
I got to do what I got to fucking do
and don't worry. I'll make it up to you.

790
00:50:09,411 --> 00:50:12,860
So she already has something shiny
coming her fucking way. All right.

791
00:50:12,980 --> 00:50:14,600
And then you go back.
You Go,

792
00:50:14,620 --> 00:50:17,960
you go up while staple is weird where
it's kind of the haves, the have nots,

793
00:50:17,961 --> 00:50:21,770
you know, see if he get to the upper
deck, those are like the open miker horse.

794
00:50:22,300 --> 00:50:23,133
All right?

795
00:50:24,020 --> 00:50:28,100
That's someone who just
fucking blew somebody in a
ticket booth to get up to the

796
00:50:28,101 --> 00:50:30,500
300 fucking level.
All right?

797
00:50:30,830 --> 00:50:35,350
So what they're going to do is they're
basically going to be dressed and hot for

798
00:50:35,350 --> 00:50:39,410
, uh, you know, I dunno, they're going
to be updated with the fucking, uh,

799
00:50:39,920 --> 00:50:43,970
potato skin. Eaton sports bar guy, right.
The season ticket holder assumption.

800
00:50:43,971 --> 00:50:46,580
I don't know what the fuck I'm consulting
things kind of unraveling all I know.

801
00:50:46,700 --> 00:50:49,270
Is this going to be a bunch of fucking
whores down there and I can't wait.

802
00:50:49,271 --> 00:50:50,300
I can't wait to look at him.

803
00:50:54,180 --> 00:50:58,640
No, I've got, I've come to this
level in life where I, I really am.

804
00:50:58,641 --> 00:51:02,100
I don't judge people. I know I'm saying
whores and gold digging. I, you know,

805
00:51:02,760 --> 00:51:05,670
I know I'm saying that ship and I'm not
in a judgmental way. The same thing.

806
00:51:05,671 --> 00:51:09,480
I don't judge that. The, the,
the fucking piece of shit.

807
00:51:10,020 --> 00:51:12,450
I guess that's judgemental, but you
know, whenever I'm a piece of shit,

808
00:51:12,451 --> 00:51:17,220
the piece of shit guy who was running,
shipped over there in Egypt, you know,

809
00:51:18,330 --> 00:51:22,260
I get why he stole all that fucking money

810
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:25,290
because it was right there.

811
00:51:26,450 --> 00:51:27,283
You know?

812
00:51:29,180 --> 00:51:30,480
Right fucking there.
I mean,

813
00:51:32,710 --> 00:51:36,150
until you are in that
position where you're,

814
00:51:36,160 --> 00:51:41,160
you're at that level of temptation
till you faced it and passed that test,

815
00:51:42,011 --> 00:51:44,890
you can't judge that guy.
Can you imagine that?

816
00:51:44,891 --> 00:51:48,510
Just a mountain of cash just sitting
right to the right. Your lazy boy,

817
00:51:48,530 --> 00:51:51,610
like a big bowl of fucking m
and m's and you guys out there,

818
00:51:51,680 --> 00:51:54,460
you've got your little fucking m
and m's right next to your TV chair.

819
00:51:55,030 --> 00:51:58,780
How many of those deed at night?
You know, you ever tell yourself,

820
00:51:58,781 --> 00:52:01,960
this is the last handful. You tell
your kid, go right back for more.

821
00:52:02,170 --> 00:52:03,700
You have a get it so fucking,

822
00:52:04,420 --> 00:52:07,480
you know you're doing that thing where
you're making the fist and then you'd get

823
00:52:07,481 --> 00:52:10,780
fucking dropping them out of the
bottom of your fists. You know,

824
00:52:10,781 --> 00:52:13,990
like some fucking,
I don't know what,

825
00:52:14,020 --> 00:52:17,320
like some Goddamn guppy feeding
at the top of a fish tank.

826
00:52:21,070 --> 00:52:21,903
Yeah.

827
00:52:22,220 --> 00:52:25,250
We're all gluttonous assholes and I'm,
I'm, I'm right up there with them.

828
00:52:26,010 --> 00:52:28,290
I don't know what the fucking point was.
I'm just telling you I'm excited.

829
00:52:28,291 --> 00:52:32,190
I'm going to this fucking game.
Uh, that's 17 minutes, 17 minutes.

830
00:52:32,250 --> 00:52:35,890
How many fucks was that sir?
Um,

831
00:52:36,930 --> 00:52:38,820
all right,
let's get on with the podcast here.

832
00:52:38,821 --> 00:52:43,140
I want to thank everybody seriously who
came out to the, uh, Terry town. Um,

833
00:52:43,680 --> 00:52:47,790
I keep forgetting the music hall and,
uh, the count Basie theater and a,

834
00:52:47,791 --> 00:52:51,090
I'm going to keep writing jokes because
that was unbelievably motivating.

835
00:52:51,091 --> 00:52:54,540
I'm gonna, I'm gonna, I'm gonna
try to do that every, every year.

836
00:52:54,630 --> 00:52:58,080
Absolutely phenomenal fucking,
uh,

837
00:52:58,830 --> 00:53:02,190
experience. I have nothing bad to say

845
00:53:25,140 --> 00:53:29,580
bill@themmpodcast.com once again,

846
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:34,230
And if you could do us a favor, if
you could just in the title, um,

847
00:53:35,220 --> 00:53:38,280
in the, in the subject line,
could you just stick, you know,

848
00:53:39,540 --> 00:53:42,960
under what category it's going to fist
fit if you have overrated, underrated,

849
00:53:42,961 --> 00:53:47,880
if you want some advice. Um, is
it racist? Your country sucks too.

850
00:53:49,800 --> 00:53:53,820
Um, anything, anything you
want to, you have a youtube
videos of the week, anything.

851
00:53:53,821 --> 00:53:58,320
Just just right. Obviously
overrated. Youtube. Is it racist,

852
00:53:58,321 --> 00:54:01,200
right in the subject line of really help
us to kind of streamline them cause I

853
00:54:01,201 --> 00:54:04,920
actually have somebody now who's gathering
all of them and just sends them to me

854
00:54:04,921 --> 00:54:07,530
one email and then, you know, I
just read through all of them.

855
00:54:07,531 --> 00:54:11,340
I picked the best ones, the ones that I
respond to. So once again, you email it

856
00:54:13,950 --> 00:54:15,750
bill@themmpodcast.com.
Um,

857
00:54:15,760 --> 00:54:20,760
and that is it in the official podcast
of the Monday morning podcast is www dot

858
00:54:20,940 --> 00:54:24,570
the MLM, podcast.com we
have all the youtube videos,

859
00:54:25,020 --> 00:54:28,320
anything that I talk about, um,
pictures of theaters, anything,

860
00:54:28,400 --> 00:54:30,270
and I'm talking about gold digging.
Who is,

861
00:54:30,420 --> 00:54:34,140
we'll have pictures in that type of shit
so you can follow along at work right

862
00:54:34,141 --> 00:54:36,330
before you slump over
and die in your cubicle.

863
00:54:40,300 --> 00:54:44,430
Um, all right. I got a little
backlash this past week from, um,

864
00:54:45,840 --> 00:54:48,870
from a number of things. One from, is
it racist and another number from, uh,

865
00:54:49,110 --> 00:54:52,170
the two drink minimum. Let's start
with two drink minimum first. Um,

866
00:54:52,710 --> 00:54:55,960
last week someone was talking about the
two drink minimum. Uh, why they have that.

867
00:54:55,961 --> 00:54:59,370
A comedy clubs and I was trying to explain
that that's basically how the comedy

868
00:54:59,371 --> 00:55:03,570
club makes money. So this guy says,
Bill, as I listened to the podcast today,

869
00:55:03,571 --> 00:55:08,571
I must disagree with your diatribe on
the two drink minimum yet you love that

870
00:55:09,240 --> 00:55:14,010
rather than my opinion becomes a
diatribe. I ain't went to, I tried means,

871
00:55:14,011 --> 00:55:18,210
but that just sounds like made and seem
like I was going on and on and on. Um,

872
00:55:18,240 --> 00:55:19,680
I agree.
That comedy club,

873
00:55:20,700 --> 00:55:24,480
I agree that comedy clubs need to
make money. Well, thank you sir.

874
00:55:24,600 --> 00:55:27,840
Thank you for extending me
that fucking olive branch.

875
00:55:28,170 --> 00:55:32,010
I agree that sometimes they
promise certain payouts.

876
00:55:32,730 --> 00:55:35,760
Okay. I wasn't asking you to
agree with it. That's how it is.

877
00:55:36,240 --> 00:55:40,230
But the two drink minimum is the
equivalent of every other company's hidden

878
00:55:40,231 --> 00:55:43,080
charges.
If the club needs to make money,

879
00:55:43,110 --> 00:55:45,900
add $20 to the price of a fucking ticket.

880
00:55:46,440 --> 00:55:51,000
People that don't drink have a real
issue being forced to buy drinks because

881
00:55:51,001 --> 00:55:54,900
some clown can't manage
his business any tighter.

882
00:55:55,710 --> 00:55:58,290
Whatever happened to
truth and advertising,

883
00:55:59,160 --> 00:56:02,920
tell me up front what the entertainment
bill is going to cost me regards.

884
00:56:03,120 --> 00:56:07,920
All right, whatever happened to
truth in advertising. Um, sir,

885
00:56:07,921 --> 00:56:12,570
if you can tell me an era when there
was ever any truth in advertising.

886
00:56:13,170 --> 00:56:15,870
Um,
I will give you a box of free DVDs.

887
00:56:16,050 --> 00:56:17,970
There's never been any
truth in advertising,

888
00:56:18,120 --> 00:56:21,120
and that includes you when you went out
to bars and you're trying to get your

889
00:56:21,121 --> 00:56:24,760
dick sucked the way you made your job
sound a lot more important than it was.

890
00:56:24,910 --> 00:56:27,370
All right? So get off your
fucking high horse right there.

891
00:56:27,371 --> 00:56:31,990
That's the first high horse you have to
get off. All right? In a nice little you,

892
00:56:31,991 --> 00:56:34,210
it's like you're fucking driving.

893
00:56:34,720 --> 00:56:38,260
You ever see the Budweiser Clydesdale
fucking thing? You know that.

894
00:56:38,440 --> 00:56:42,400
I don't know what it does. The stage
coach for the guy who owns Budweiser,

895
00:56:42,401 --> 00:56:45,850
I never really understood what the fuck
that thing was supposed to be. But uh,

896
00:56:45,851 --> 00:56:49,390
you have a team of Clydesdale
high horses here. All right.

897
00:56:50,050 --> 00:56:54,970
The fact that you have to state that of
Goddamn business needs to make money and

898
00:56:54,971 --> 00:56:59,560
that they actually promised to pay the
ax. I don't understand those points. Um,

899
00:57:00,750 --> 00:57:01,780
and s okay.
First of all,

900
00:57:01,781 --> 00:57:05,560
he's saying that a two drink minimum is
the equivalent of every other company's

901
00:57:05,561 --> 00:57:09,190
hidden charges. There's nothing
hidden about the two drink minimum.

902
00:57:10,680 --> 00:57:12,360
It's written on the fucking ticket.

903
00:57:12,510 --> 00:57:15,930
It's on a sign inside the
club as you're walking in,

904
00:57:16,230 --> 00:57:20,070
it's announced before the show.
Everything two drink minimum,

905
00:57:21,120 --> 00:57:26,120
they actually have called comedy should
teach shows on TV to drink two drink

906
00:57:26,701 --> 00:57:30,450
minimum. They used to be a show called
two drink minimum. You know what I mean?

907
00:57:31,140 --> 00:57:34,980
It's like you'd saying that there's some
sort of hidden thing that a fire engine

908
00:57:34,981 --> 00:57:38,550
is red. You go into a club, there's
a two drink minimum. All right?

909
00:57:38,551 --> 00:57:40,640
What I think is really
going on here is you,

910
00:57:40,641 --> 00:57:44,400
you don't understand the business
of running a comedy club.

911
00:57:45,290 --> 00:57:49,950
All right? The, the, I don't
understand why you're saying,

912
00:57:50,190 --> 00:57:54,690
why don't you, why don't you, uh, people
that don't drink have a real itch.

913
00:57:54,720 --> 00:57:58,650
Everybody drinks, sir. Everybody drinks.

914
00:58:00,060 --> 00:58:03,760
All right? You don't drink. You don't
drink it all. You don't drink water.

915
00:58:03,761 --> 00:58:06,040
You don't drink soda,
you don't drink at all.

916
00:58:07,180 --> 00:58:09,970
You don't have to buy a
drink that has alcohol in it,

917
00:58:10,090 --> 00:58:12,970
but you have to buy a drink.
All right,

918
00:58:13,090 --> 00:58:15,640
and you're getting mad at
the wrong fucking people.

919
00:58:15,641 --> 00:58:19,450
You're getting mad at the club because
they're forcing you to buy drinks.

920
00:58:19,660 --> 00:58:21,130
Why do you think that is?

921
00:58:23,040 --> 00:58:25,290
Why do you think he cut
the club owners greedy?

922
00:58:26,640 --> 00:58:30,840
The reason why they force you to buy
drinks is because of the amount of fucking

923
00:58:30,841 --> 00:58:35,730
tightwads that show up to clubs and
go, can I have a water? Two straws,

924
00:58:35,731 --> 00:58:38,860
police. That's the problem. All right.

925
00:58:40,750 --> 00:58:40,990
See,

926
00:58:40,990 --> 00:58:45,160
back in the day that probably wasn't a
two drink minimum because back in the day

927
00:58:45,310 --> 00:58:49,480
the artists used to get unbelievably
fucked by the promoter, believe it or not,

928
00:58:49,481 --> 00:58:50,314
back in the day.

929
00:58:50,410 --> 00:58:55,410
This is like before free agency in sports
back in the day believer it or not,

930
00:58:55,991 --> 00:58:59,140
when a band, a comedian,
any sort of entertainer,

931
00:58:59,141 --> 00:59:01,270
went to a venue to perform.

932
00:59:01,450 --> 00:59:06,450
The promoter got 80% of the door
and the artists got 20% all right.

933
00:59:10,570 --> 00:59:15,550
But because of the brilliance and the
balls of Peter Grant with led Zeppelin,

934
00:59:16,610 --> 00:59:18,640
as far as I know,
I'm giving him credit.

935
00:59:18,641 --> 00:59:22,310
He's the first guy I read that finally
went up to the and said, listen mate,

936
00:59:22,740 --> 00:59:24,960
they come in here to look at
the fucking building. Alright,

937
00:59:25,300 --> 00:59:28,400
you silly cunt that come in here
to see fucking led Zeppelin.

938
00:59:28,580 --> 00:59:32,120
I know it's a brutal, brutal British
accent, but he was the guy going, listen,

939
00:59:32,750 --> 00:59:34,430
nobody gives a fuck about your building.

940
00:59:34,550 --> 00:59:36,980
I could stick these guys in
any fucking building out here.

941
00:59:37,130 --> 00:59:39,530
They're going to sell out because
they're coming to see the band.

942
00:59:39,650 --> 00:59:41,150
So he was the guy who said,
listen,

943
00:59:41,151 --> 00:59:44,780
we get 80% you get fucking 20% all right?

944
00:59:47,070 --> 00:59:52,070
So the promoter has to make his fucking
money and he makes money by selling food

945
00:59:52,891 --> 00:59:57,090
and drinks, all right? That's
how it is. But the problem is,

946
00:59:57,180 --> 01:00:00,330
is people will go in there and they won't
fucking buy drinks or they won't buy

947
01:00:00,331 --> 01:00:03,570
food. They'll go in there and they will
sit there and they will sip on a fucking

948
01:00:03,571 --> 01:00:07,050
water.
That's why there is a two drink minimum,

949
01:00:07,110 --> 01:00:11,190
which is advertised on the fucking ticket.
It is advertised.

950
01:00:11,220 --> 01:00:13,980
They haven't on a signed before
you even fucking walk in there.

951
01:00:14,420 --> 01:00:18,150
The you call up the comedy club.
They say there is a two drink minimum.

952
01:00:19,500 --> 01:00:22,560
This show is 21 and older
with a two drink minimum.

953
01:00:22,980 --> 01:00:26,550
I've heard that maybe 40 million
times in my comedy career.

954
01:00:26,551 --> 01:00:30,630
There is no sort of false advertising
going on here, sir. All right.

955
01:00:31,160 --> 01:00:34,490
That is why they have to make money,
dude.

956
01:00:35,070 --> 01:00:38,090
Do you know much money it costs to run
a fucking club? Do you know much money?

957
01:00:38,091 --> 01:00:39,980
It costs to get a liquor license.
You want to people,

958
01:00:39,981 --> 01:00:42,290
you have to grease the
amount of taxes you have to

959
01:00:42,330 --> 01:00:46,140
pay the amount you have to pay and
fucking rent. All of that bullshit.

960
01:00:47,540 --> 01:00:48,950
You know what?
You don't.

961
01:00:50,810 --> 01:00:55,490
I know a guy who opened up a fucking
theater and it was these union guys.

962
01:00:56,110 --> 01:00:59,420
All right.
And to change the sign,

963
01:00:59,570 --> 01:01:02,660
he had to hire two union guys,
one guy to go up the ladder,

964
01:01:02,661 --> 01:01:06,230
one guy to hold the fucking ladder
and a cop to stand there and make sure

965
01:01:06,231 --> 01:01:07,190
everything was fine,

966
01:01:08,020 --> 01:01:11,810
was costing him like 1500 bucks to put up.

967
01:01:11,811 --> 01:01:15,800
And this week come down and check out
Bob Saget or wherever the fuck was there.

968
01:01:17,990 --> 01:01:22,990
So he had to sit there in lobby with
politicians and lobby with all these

969
01:01:23,241 --> 01:01:27,410
fucking people and try and go around
unions and all this fucking horseshit just

970
01:01:27,411 --> 01:01:31,370
so he could get a sign out front that he
could change electronically from inside

971
01:01:31,371 --> 01:01:32,204
the building.

972
01:01:32,850 --> 01:01:36,920
Do you want to stand that fifth 1500
bucks a week times 52 weeks a year?

973
01:01:37,040 --> 01:01:40,460
That's just, if you just change
it once, forget about this guy.

974
01:01:40,461 --> 01:01:41,480
The way he had it running,

975
01:01:41,600 --> 01:01:45,170
he had a musical act and a comedy act and
then a musical act every fucking week.

976
01:01:45,171 --> 01:01:49,850
So it's three times a week. That's
what, 3040 500 bucks. That's like,

977
01:01:50,030 --> 01:01:54,740
what? 250 fucking grand a year to get a
guy to change letters on a fucking sign.

978
01:01:54,741 --> 01:01:57,770
Okay. It costs money to run a
goddamn business. All right.

979
01:01:58,700 --> 01:01:59,840
I don't know what else to tell you.

980
01:02:00,910 --> 01:02:01,230
Okay.

981
01:02:01,230 --> 01:02:05,700
But you getting mad at clubs for
having two drink minimums. It's,

982
01:02:05,940 --> 01:02:10,770
it's, you know, it's not
the club. It's not the club.

983
01:02:11,280 --> 01:02:15,850
It's all, it's the tight Fox sit next
to you. Who's going to bring cheese?

984
01:02:15,990 --> 01:02:19,500
It's in and a little butter knife to
spread his cheese on and that shit,

985
01:02:19,501 --> 01:02:20,130
you know,
I don't

986
01:02:20,130 --> 01:02:23,760
fucking stay home. I don't know what to
tell you. I don't know what to tell you.

987
01:02:25,270 --> 01:02:29,140
Uh, what else? Oh,

988
01:02:29,740 --> 01:02:32,940
what are the backlash shake?
I've got to this week on the, uh,

989
01:02:34,290 --> 01:02:38,370
the fuck was it? Is it racist? Went
back and forth with this fucking guy,

990
01:02:38,371 --> 01:02:39,990
which was hilarious.
This guy was,

991
01:02:40,020 --> 01:02:44,580
he wrote that guy last week who wrote
the thing where you said a bill.

992
01:02:44,581 --> 01:02:48,570
Older Asian is racist as
shit. I'm sorry, but it is.

993
01:02:49,110 --> 01:02:50,670
So I wrote him back where I was like,
well dude,

994
01:02:50,671 --> 01:02:53,520
you kind of have to elaborate
on your point. And number two,

995
01:02:53,521 --> 01:02:56,460
why are you apologizing?
That's kind of a pet peeve of mine.

996
01:02:56,461 --> 01:03:00,270
I hate when someone does is agree with
you. And then they apologize. I'm sorry,

997
01:03:00,271 --> 01:03:02,250
but your angst like, dude,
you're not, you're not sorry.

998
01:03:02,910 --> 01:03:06,540
Why are you saying you're sorry?
What are you sorry about?

999
01:03:06,570 --> 01:03:09,690
You're not fucking sorry.
Stop saying you're sorry.

1000
01:03:10,740 --> 01:03:15,740
So this guy goes on and on and on and
he proceeds to basically say that I was

1001
01:03:16,081 --> 01:03:19,950
playing on Asian
stereotypes. Um, and that,

1002
01:03:19,980 --> 01:03:23,970
and I had preconceived
notions about Asians and all
this type of shit. You know,

1003
01:03:23,971 --> 01:03:28,890
and I don't give a fuck if you
are just joking. That is racist.

1004
01:03:29,160 --> 01:03:32,040
I don't give a fuck how you meant it.
It's fucking race.

1005
01:03:32,041 --> 01:03:34,710
All that psycho shit.

1006
01:03:34,711 --> 01:03:39,390
And then he proceeds to prove
his point by then hitting me.

1007
01:03:39,460 --> 01:03:41,850
I Dunno what he,
the rest of his fucking email,

1008
01:03:42,330 --> 01:03:45,240
he was trying to give me examples
that my preconceived notions,

1009
01:03:45,290 --> 01:03:49,420
my alleged preconceived notions about
Asians was fucked up as he then dumps of

1010
01:03:49,500 --> 01:03:53,950
all his preconceived notions about
white people. He goes, really?

1011
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:55,560
Are the Asians the only bad drivers?

1012
01:03:55,561 --> 01:04:00,540
What about all those rich
white kids denting their
dad's Mercedes on the regular

1013
01:04:02,490 --> 01:04:04,730
fucking Hilarious, you know? All right.

1014
01:04:04,750 --> 01:04:07,920
And then I just asked him to name who
those rich white kids were because you

1015
01:04:07,921 --> 01:04:10,680
know, I hung out with a letter,
wrote white kids growing up,

1016
01:04:10,800 --> 01:04:14,940
all white kids and none of them are dads
had fucking w who are these rich white

1017
01:04:14,941 --> 01:04:17,850
kids, sir? Where did you
meet these rich white kids?

1018
01:04:18,210 --> 01:04:22,290
Where you and your younger brother with
the fucking kidney disease adopted by a

1019
01:04:22,291 --> 01:04:25,080
rich white man? Is that how you
ran into all these rich white kids?

1020
01:04:25,380 --> 01:04:29,520
You're fucking generalizing. You're
doing the exact same horse shit. So,

1021
01:04:29,790 --> 01:04:32,420
but it ended up being a great
debate. And this is, this is what I,

1022
01:04:32,430 --> 01:04:36,570
this is what I've, I've, I've come to
realize about jokes when it comes to race.

1023
01:04:36,600 --> 01:04:39,990
I think I could be wrong here,
but I think they threw,

1024
01:04:40,170 --> 01:04:44,340
there's three categories when you do it.
When you joke in a racial way,

1025
01:04:45,440 --> 01:04:49,710
it can either a be straight up,
funny B,

1026
01:04:49,920 --> 01:04:54,600
be offensive or c be racist and it all,

1027
01:04:54,960 --> 01:04:57,660
and there's a bunch of
variables that play into it.

1028
01:04:57,730 --> 01:05:00,540
It plays in to the intent of the person.

1029
01:05:01,320 --> 01:05:03,870
If your intent is not
to be fucking racist,

1030
01:05:04,050 --> 01:05:06,960
what you said I believe is not racist.

1031
01:05:07,380 --> 01:05:11,130
What it is at that point is offensive.
You made a joke,

1032
01:05:11,131 --> 01:05:15,060
you thought it was going to be funny,
but people took it a different way.

1033
01:05:15,070 --> 01:05:19,000
They didn't find it funny.
They're saying it's racist.

1034
01:05:19,170 --> 01:05:21,160
You acknowledged just
fucking around and it's like,

1035
01:05:21,190 --> 01:05:24,940
well at that then it
becomes offensive I think.

1036
01:05:25,740 --> 01:05:26,573
All right,

1037
01:05:27,160 --> 01:05:32,160
and then it also comes down to your
relationship because if you know you're

1038
01:05:34,121 --> 01:05:38,170
fucking white and somebody else is
black or whatever and your friends,

1039
01:05:39,310 --> 01:05:44,310
the level of being offended gets
pushed way down the goddamn streets.

1040
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:49,600
You know, to the point. Sometimes
if other people are listening,

1041
01:05:49,630 --> 01:05:52,240
they can't believe what the fuck the
two of you were saying to each other,

1042
01:05:53,260 --> 01:05:58,180
but I still maintain, it comes
down to intent now that older age.

1043
01:05:58,360 --> 01:06:01,750
Oh and and the social situation,
all the region of just fucking around.

1044
01:06:02,500 --> 01:06:03,370
It's a joke.

1045
01:06:03,430 --> 01:06:08,430
It's not racist because I don't have
any fucking bad feelings about agents.

1046
01:06:08,620 --> 01:06:11,170
It's just something for,
it's a funny fucking game.

1047
01:06:11,171 --> 01:06:16,171
I came up with driving and
traffic after I saw a pattern,

1048
01:06:17,980 --> 01:06:22,980
I kept getting cut off and it just seemed
that 80% of the fucking time it was

1049
01:06:23,711 --> 01:06:26,380
either some old due to some Asian dude,
so it was a joke.

1050
01:06:26,381 --> 01:06:29,800
I started playing that game with my
girl. What do you want? Older Asian,

1051
01:06:29,801 --> 01:06:33,220
what do you got? Put your money
on the table just fucking around.

1052
01:06:33,430 --> 01:06:38,020
Now obviously if I'm doing
that outside of the car,

1053
01:06:38,080 --> 01:06:40,180
I'm going to fucking offense.
I'm going to offend somebody,

1054
01:06:41,110 --> 01:06:44,980
but it's still not racist because
I don't mean it that way, you know?

1055
01:06:44,981 --> 01:06:47,890
I know a lot of people gonna fucking
disagree with that, but I truly,

1056
01:06:49,510 --> 01:06:54,070
you can't tell me what the fuck. I mean,
I know what I'm thinking. You know?

1057
01:06:55,210 --> 01:06:57,490
Does that fucking May, I don't
know. I don't fucking know.

1058
01:06:58,720 --> 01:07:01,060
But in the same thing is
that that older Asian thing,

1059
01:07:01,180 --> 01:07:05,110
Barack Obama couldn't be in the middle
of doing the state of the union. Go on.

1060
01:07:05,170 --> 01:07:07,250
We're going to get turns into country
around, we're going to do this.

1061
01:07:07,251 --> 01:07:08,540
We'll do that. And you
know what? You know what,

1062
01:07:08,541 --> 01:07:11,090
I like to play in the back
whenever my limo gets cut up.

1063
01:07:11,210 --> 01:07:14,830
I played this game called older Asian,
you know,

1064
01:07:14,980 --> 01:07:19,220
that's even that. If he's just fucking
around, I don't think that's racist.

1065
01:07:19,340 --> 01:07:22,220
It's incredibly irresponsible
and would be taken that way.

1066
01:07:22,340 --> 01:07:25,880
And at the very least it would be
unbelievably fucking offensive. But I,

1067
01:07:25,881 --> 01:07:27,740
that's what I think.
You guys tell me what you think.

1068
01:07:27,860 --> 01:07:32,540
I think if you just fucking around,
if you don't mean it in a malicious way,

1069
01:07:32,700 --> 01:07:35,090
it's, it's not racist.
You can be ignorant.

1070
01:07:35,240 --> 01:07:38,000
You can offend fucking people and
that type of stuff. But you know,

1071
01:07:38,990 --> 01:07:43,990
I really don't think that me playing
a game called older Asian is,

1072
01:07:46,490 --> 01:07:50,150
is racist.
Like some fucking guy in the clan going,

1073
01:07:50,151 --> 01:07:52,250
we need to get these
people out of the country.

1074
01:07:52,580 --> 01:07:57,020
They're beasts and that type
of shit. All right. I know.

1075
01:07:57,230 --> 01:08:00,860
Say we'll do the two dot. So you're, what
you're doing is a lighter form now. No,

1076
01:08:00,861 --> 01:08:05,090
I'm not. No, I'm not. You're an
oversensitive fucking cunt. All right?

1077
01:08:05,240 --> 01:08:07,010
And you're so far to the fucking left.

1078
01:08:07,070 --> 01:08:11,090
You're actually doing like this
McCarthyism, bleeding heart horse. Shit.

1079
01:08:11,120 --> 01:08:14,090
Go Fuck Yourself. Lighten
the fuck up. Okay.

1080
01:08:14,180 --> 01:08:18,380
Like when when I a black comic or
somebody's given me shit that white people

1081
01:08:18,381 --> 01:08:22,760
can't dunk a basketball or they
can't fucking dance, you know,

1082
01:08:23,750 --> 01:08:26,960
depending on how they say,
if they say it in a mean enough way,

1083
01:08:26,961 --> 01:08:31,040
I could get offended. I maybe could
get offended. But first of all,

1084
01:08:31,150 --> 01:08:33,950
my honestly going to sit there
and act like generally speaking,

1085
01:08:33,951 --> 01:08:35,420
white dudes can fucking dance.
Well,

1086
01:08:35,421 --> 01:08:38,240
white people in general or
that were dunking a basketball,

1087
01:08:38,330 --> 01:08:41,180
how many six foot 11
fucking guys have I seen

1088
01:08:42,940 --> 01:08:47,410
two and a half step and they just
fucking dislocate their shoulder,

1089
01:08:47,411 --> 01:08:51,460
hitting the ball in the front of
the fucking room. You know, I think,

1090
01:08:51,461 --> 01:08:53,210
you know what?
I think a lot of people they don't have,

1091
01:08:53,320 --> 01:08:57,460
they don't have a fucking sense of
humor either. So, uh, I don't know.

1092
01:08:57,461 --> 01:09:01,150
I think that guy last week at the Tony
Gwynn game, that's fucking hilarious.

1093
01:09:02,570 --> 01:09:05,330
That game that other guy played
where he sits there saying, you know,

1094
01:09:05,670 --> 01:09:08,960
he turns his back to the news and he
hears the crime and he tries to guess the

1095
01:09:08,961 --> 01:09:11,120
race is fucking hilarious.

1096
01:09:12,130 --> 01:09:15,680
This guy had three heads in his
refrigerator, crazy ass white guy,

1097
01:09:15,710 --> 01:09:18,380
crazy as cracker or whatever.
Like that's, it's funny.

1098
01:09:19,850 --> 01:09:21,320
Am I saying anything funny in this week?

1099
01:09:21,321 --> 01:09:24,060
I feel like I've just been ranting for
the past 20 fucking minutes. All right,

1100
01:09:24,061 --> 01:09:28,910
let's, let's plow ahead here. Oh, some
advice. All right. Advice Bill. Uh,

1101
01:09:28,911 --> 01:09:32,420
I've heard you mentioned a few times
that when you dedicated yourself to

1102
01:09:32,421 --> 01:09:34,760
following your dream,
you sa as a comedian,

1103
01:09:34,761 --> 01:09:39,080
you sacrificed everything to throw
yourself completely into comedy.

1104
01:09:39,870 --> 01:09:42,440
And then you usually say that on some
level it was easier for you to put

1105
01:09:42,441 --> 01:09:45,950
everything on the line because you were
young and it didn't have a lot to risk.

1106
01:09:46,040 --> 01:09:47,390
I'm 37 years old,

1107
01:09:47,690 --> 01:09:52,370
old jeans with a wife and two young
boys who are ages four and six.

1108
01:09:52,420 --> 01:09:54,830
A year ago I decided that
I wanted to be a comedian.

1109
01:09:55,250 --> 01:09:59,210
I've been doing open mikes consistently
for a year and I feel like I have real

1110
01:09:59,211 --> 01:10:01,790
potential.
I know it takes a lot of time to get good.

1111
01:10:01,790 --> 01:10:04,340
My problem is I can't
pay this month's rent.

1112
01:10:05,540 --> 01:10:09,500
I'm scared to get a better
fulltime job because it will take,

1113
01:10:11,630 --> 01:10:16,350
um, Mr Away. It'll take
me away from my dream.

1114
01:10:16,351 --> 01:10:17,220
A little typo there.

1115
01:10:17,760 --> 01:10:20,940
When you are older and have
responsibilities like kids and a wife,

1116
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:24,570
how do you justify taking
risks to go for your dream?

1117
01:10:25,680 --> 01:10:26,760
All right, dude. All right.

1118
01:10:26,761 --> 01:10:30,630
This is a rough one for me to give
you advice on because I had never,

1119
01:10:30,690 --> 01:10:32,460
I've never been in that situation.

1120
01:10:32,700 --> 01:10:36,570
And also I never want
to talk somebody out of,

1121
01:10:36,630 --> 01:10:39,150
of doing what you want to do.

1122
01:10:39,151 --> 01:10:42,240
You should definitely keep doing standup
if that's what your heart's telling you

1123
01:10:42,241 --> 01:10:44,100
to do.
But as a man,

1124
01:10:44,101 --> 01:10:48,690
you cannot have a wife and kids and
not be able to pay the rent. All right?

1125
01:10:49,980 --> 01:10:50,010
Um,

1126
01:10:50,010 --> 01:10:54,060
you need to get a better full time job
and you just need to fucking work harder

1127
01:10:54,450 --> 01:10:56,820
and be more efficient when
you go out to the club.

1128
01:10:57,430 --> 01:11:02,250
If you've been hanging out a little
bit, don't hang out at all. And um,

1129
01:11:03,380 --> 01:11:08,170
you know, it's what you're
trying to do is not impossible,

1130
01:11:08,320 --> 01:11:11,560
but I will tell you this.
You can't

1131
01:11:13,460 --> 01:11:18,360
LACUSC kid hope. All right? The number
one job of a man is to fucking provide.

1132
01:11:18,810 --> 01:11:22,860
He have to provide for your
family. If you're not, you know,

1133
01:11:24,130 --> 01:11:28,740
I, you know, I, I, I don't want
to say this, but a lot at you,

1134
01:11:29,140 --> 01:11:33,560
the women look at you like you're
fucking useless. All right?

1135
01:11:33,561 --> 01:11:35,540
That's like them without a fucking vagina.

1136
01:11:35,900 --> 01:11:39,470
And I hate to reduce them as sex objects,
but that's just how we view you

1137
01:11:41,270 --> 01:11:45,890
fucking with you. But seriously, all
right, you have to provide, okay.

1138
01:11:45,891 --> 01:11:49,010
This is the thing I think, you
know, if your wife is cool,

1139
01:11:49,011 --> 01:11:52,850
she will understand that you
want to make this transition,

1140
01:11:53,390 --> 01:11:55,880
but you have to make it
as smooth as possible.

1141
01:11:56,000 --> 01:12:00,830
You can't be in a situation where you're,
where you can't pay the fucking rent.

1142
01:12:01,480 --> 01:12:04,280
All right? So, um,

1143
01:12:05,120 --> 01:12:10,120
I would get a better day job
if you had to at this time.

1144
01:12:11,620 --> 01:12:15,400
So you can pay the fucking rent and
then you can burn it at both ends and do

1145
01:12:15,401 --> 01:12:17,590
your stand up at night or whatever,
right?

1146
01:12:17,950 --> 01:12:20,620
And then eventually when you
start getting paid gigs with that,

1147
01:12:20,621 --> 01:12:24,790
then you can start to phase out the
fucking day job. All right? But, uh,

1148
01:12:25,270 --> 01:12:28,510
if I was you, I would sit down and
have a heart to heart with your wife.

1149
01:12:29,380 --> 01:12:32,620
So she gets where your head's at,
you know, and just tell her, look,

1150
01:12:32,621 --> 01:12:36,670
I really want to do this, but I understand
my job as a man, as I have to provide.

1151
01:12:36,671 --> 01:12:41,110
So I have, this won't happen
again. Yeah. You know,

1152
01:12:41,380 --> 01:12:45,210
you gotta have you got up, you got
to pay the fucking pills. Yeah.

1153
01:12:45,550 --> 01:12:50,350
Yeah. You know, you gotta pay
the fucking bills. It's just,

1154
01:12:50,920 --> 01:12:53,950
it's your job as a guy.
It really is.

1155
01:12:53,951 --> 01:12:58,951
I don't give a fuck about all is equal
rights in fucking independent women.

1156
01:12:59,470 --> 01:13:01,240
Put Your fucking titties
in the air or whatever.

1157
01:13:01,241 --> 01:13:06,160
How the fuck that Goddamn Song goes?
All right. Providing is our job.

1158
01:13:06,520 --> 01:13:10,750
That's our fucking job. We
have to, you have to do it.

1159
01:13:12,040 --> 01:13:16,030
Wait, you have to fucking do it. You know?
What do you fucking Steadman, you know?

1160
01:13:16,330 --> 01:13:20,800
I guess that's okay if you're, if you're,
if you're, you're, your chick is Oprah.

1161
01:13:22,150 --> 01:13:24,100
Speaking of which you ever
seen some of the operas houses.

1162
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:27,760
I became fascinated with that when I did
that red bank and I was just looking at

1163
01:13:27,761 --> 01:13:30,790
those fucking houses,
the level of wealth,

1164
01:13:31,300 --> 01:13:33,910
and I just started typing
in Bill Gates' house,

1165
01:13:34,360 --> 01:13:36,040
Oprah's house and just like the most,

1166
01:13:36,070 --> 01:13:39,010
the richest people I could fucking
think of. Like Jesus Christ,

1167
01:13:40,720 --> 01:13:45,700
Jesus Christ, m and m's house
looked up his for some reason.

1168
01:13:47,260 --> 01:13:50,980
Um, they're unbelievable.
These, the first of all,

1169
01:13:51,100 --> 01:13:55,650
they always like in like surrounding
them was always like a forest like that

1170
01:13:55,760 --> 01:13:58,750
maybe would have, they're so rich
that we have neighbors. Some of them,

1171
01:13:58,751 --> 01:14:01,210
some of them are, they've lived, you
know, crowded areas like Miami beach.

1172
01:14:01,211 --> 01:14:06,010
But some of these fucking people like
m and m's house look like a, like a,

1173
01:14:08,510 --> 01:14:09,800
I don't even know how to describe it.

1174
01:14:11,560 --> 01:14:16,220
It looked like a house.
That guy looks like an optical illusion.

1175
01:14:16,940 --> 01:14:19,680
Like it was a house. And then you give
us, he like in a movie, like where it,

1176
01:14:19,681 --> 01:14:23,150
all of a sudden a guy just
gets a hunchback. That's
what his house looked like.

1177
01:14:23,151 --> 01:14:25,610
It was a house. And then bomb, there's
another part of the house. And then,

1178
01:14:25,640 --> 01:14:27,740
then another house who's like,

1179
01:14:27,741 --> 01:14:32,660
he just took like these 20 fucking
houses and just stuck them all together.

1180
01:14:35,090 --> 01:14:38,090
That'd be a great house to have if,
if, if you were wanted by the law,

1181
01:14:38,900 --> 01:14:43,410
you know what I mean? You could literally
hide out in your own fucking house,

1182
01:14:47,990 --> 01:14:48,690
take by,

1183
01:14:48,690 --> 01:14:51,690
by at least another two and a half weeks
of freedom by the time they fucking

1184
01:14:51,691 --> 01:14:56,250
found you. You know, I don't know. I
don't know what the Hell I'm saying.

1185
01:14:57,120 --> 01:15:00,270
Um, so anyways, do that. That's, that's a
real tough situation. I hope you work out.

1186
01:15:00,271 --> 01:15:02,820
Don't give up on your
dream, but, uh, you know,

1187
01:15:03,630 --> 01:15:06,480
your wife is going to be way more
supportive if, if, if you're,

1188
01:15:06,481 --> 01:15:10,200
if you're paying the Goddamn, but you
gotta pay the bills. Got To pay the bills.

1189
01:15:10,201 --> 01:15:12,570
All right, here we go.
Next one. Hey, Bill. Uh,

1190
01:15:12,750 --> 01:15:14,700
as for advice a couple of months
ago about a friend of mine,

1191
01:15:14,701 --> 01:15:15,870
this was another brutal one.

1192
01:15:17,450 --> 01:15:17,710
Yeah.

1193
01:15:17,710 --> 01:15:21,600
But a friend of mine who's girlfriend
was having a kid and I was suspicious

1194
01:15:21,601 --> 01:15:25,710
about whether or not, um, it was his,

1195
01:15:26,100 --> 01:15:29,220
because he had gone and gotten checked
twice to see if he could have kids.

1196
01:15:29,340 --> 01:15:33,720
And the doctors said, no. Oh, I
remember this guy. Remember that one?

1197
01:15:35,400 --> 01:15:37,710
The doctor said this
guy got checked twice.

1198
01:15:37,800 --> 01:15:42,780
They said he couldn't have kids and all
of a sudden his girl was pregnant and

1199
01:15:42,781 --> 01:15:45,630
there was questions about her
being faithful. I remember this,

1200
01:15:45,870 --> 01:15:49,050
I remember this well, this is the
update of this. He said, well,

1201
01:15:49,051 --> 01:15:52,230
about five months into the pregnancy,
she miscarried.

1202
01:15:52,800 --> 01:15:56,910
So the problem kind of solved itself,
but it was a terrible thing to happen.

1203
01:15:57,390 --> 01:16:01,800
Now they are living together and I'm
still pretty positive she was cheating on

1204
01:16:01,801 --> 01:16:05,730
him and he's hanging onto the relationship
now through some sort of guilt

1205
01:16:05,731 --> 01:16:07,260
because of the lost child.

1206
01:16:07,740 --> 01:16:11,430
It just feels like my friend got one
pulled over on him and I really want to

1207
01:16:11,431 --> 01:16:15,990
talk to him about it, but I can't
find a good way to do it. Uh,

1208
01:16:16,140 --> 01:16:19,590
your podcasts rules and I help you come
to Edmonton sometime. It'll comic strip,

1209
01:16:19,591 --> 01:16:23,610
right? The comic strip in Edmonton. I'll
make my way up there at some point. Um,

1210
01:16:25,750 --> 01:16:30,570
dude, that is a brutal, brutal,
brutal, brutal situation. And uh,

1211
01:16:31,230 --> 01:16:32,490
it all depends on how you feel.

1212
01:16:32,800 --> 01:16:35,100
How are you going to be able to live
with yourself if you just say, listen,

1213
01:16:35,400 --> 01:16:38,250
this kid is just a moron.
He's my friend,

1214
01:16:38,251 --> 01:16:43,130
but he's a fucking moron because
that is an option. You know,

1215
01:16:43,460 --> 01:16:45,620
the good moment, you know, when he, uh,

1216
01:16:46,010 --> 01:16:49,310
they tell that joke in Italian and Deniro
says, what does it mean in, in pet?

1217
01:16:49,460 --> 01:16:53,180
She goes, it means he's, he's
content to be a jerk. You know,

1218
01:16:53,570 --> 01:16:54,351
what am I going to say?

1219
01:16:54,351 --> 01:16:58,670
My wife two times me that joke basically
about a guy who knows his wife's

1220
01:16:58,671 --> 01:17:01,220
fucking around on him and he just doesn't,
he just looks the other way.

1221
01:17:01,221 --> 01:17:04,460
He's content to be a jerk.
So that's what your friend is right now.

1222
01:17:05,090 --> 01:17:09,890
I know this emotions involved, so
there's, there is hope for them, but

1223
01:17:12,410 --> 01:17:13,580
you know,
he's,

1224
01:17:16,280 --> 01:17:18,170
he's fucking himself over.
So this is the deal.

1225
01:17:18,171 --> 01:17:21,230
If you can live with yourself and just
say, this guy's contend to be a jerk.

1226
01:17:21,350 --> 01:17:24,320
I'm not going to get in the fucking
middle of this because there's so many

1227
01:17:24,321 --> 01:17:28,850
obvious red flags here and this kid
is just choosing to ignore them.

1228
01:17:31,040 --> 01:17:34,610
Um, you could just say, fuck it.
He's content to be a fucking idiot,

1229
01:17:34,611 --> 01:17:36,650
but if you're not going to be
able to live with yourself,

1230
01:17:36,651 --> 01:17:41,540
then I would just sit down and
talk to them. All right? And,

1231
01:17:42,140 --> 01:17:47,120
um, hopefully listens to you and if
not, and he stops being your friend.

1232
01:17:49,340 --> 01:17:52,850
Um, there's nothing you
can fucking do about that.

1233
01:17:53,030 --> 01:17:56,810
And I got a feeling probably
seven or eight years from now,

1234
01:17:58,370 --> 01:18:01,960
you might get a phone call to him saying,
you know what, you are right. But the,

1235
01:18:01,961 --> 01:18:05,780
those are impossible situations.

1236
01:18:06,290 --> 01:18:08,570
Jesus Christ.
How the fuck would I handle that?

1237
01:18:11,420 --> 01:18:15,230
I would, uh, I would say
something. You know what? I would,

1238
01:18:15,830 --> 01:18:18,950
I would definitely say something,
but uh,

1239
01:18:19,970 --> 01:18:24,770
I don't know how to do that, to be honest
with you. I didn't fuck what I was sad.

1240
01:18:24,771 --> 01:18:28,580
I say, listen, you know, I'm friends
with you. We've been friends a long time.

1241
01:18:29,290 --> 01:18:34,100
That's what your buddy knows.
Something fucked ups coming. Let's see.

1242
01:18:34,220 --> 01:18:37,730
We've been friends a long time, right
pat? A lot of good times, right? You know,

1243
01:18:38,630 --> 01:18:39,021
you know,

1244
01:18:39,021 --> 01:18:42,380
you know that I've always been there
for you and I never tried to steer you

1245
01:18:42,381 --> 01:18:46,700
wrong. Right? Like I
think your girlfriend,

1246
01:18:46,701 --> 01:18:50,660
is it two timing?
Yeah.

1247
01:18:50,661 --> 01:18:51,710
How do you say that?

1248
01:18:54,260 --> 01:18:56,540
I would just rip the bandaid off.

1249
01:18:57,470 --> 01:18:59,780
Just say listen to something
I have to talk to you about.

1250
01:18:59,900 --> 01:19:03,770
We're friends and as a friend.
All right.

1251
01:19:04,370 --> 01:19:09,370
I can't stop thinking about this and it
would kill me to not bring this up to

1252
01:19:09,981 --> 01:19:12,470
you. I have to do this. I'm
not trying to be malicious.

1253
01:19:13,280 --> 01:19:16,760
I'm doing this because you're my
friend and then I would just say, look,

1254
01:19:18,740 --> 01:19:22,160
ah Jesus. I just had it narrowed. He
forgets how fucking difficult disease.

1255
01:19:22,670 --> 01:19:26,780
I would just be. It's
fucking ridiculous. Look,

1256
01:19:27,080 --> 01:19:31,100
you told me you couldn't have kids.
You went to the doctor twice.

1257
01:19:32,030 --> 01:19:34,820
You got tested.
They said you couldn't have kids yet.

1258
01:19:34,821 --> 01:19:38,810
This girl somehow got fucking pregnant.
Don't say fuck there yet.

1259
01:19:40,070 --> 01:19:42,740
Your, your, your girls
somehow got pregnant. Okay.

1260
01:19:45,590 --> 01:19:46,820
Then you just sort of stare at them.

1261
01:19:49,610 --> 01:19:51,860
I Dunno where to go from there.
All right.

1262
01:19:52,700 --> 01:19:57,230
My guts telling me that that
wasn't your fucking kid too.

1263
01:19:57,231 --> 01:19:58,640
That's a hard one to that one,
that,

1264
01:19:58,670 --> 01:20:01,100
that kid you just fucking cried
over that didn't get born.

1265
01:20:01,250 --> 01:20:06,230
I don't think it was yours. Anyways.
Ah, Jesus, dude, this is fucking brutal.

1266
01:20:06,680 --> 01:20:07,513
Brutal.

1267
01:20:11,890 --> 01:20:12,360
Um,

1268
01:20:12,360 --> 01:20:13,560
I would do,
this is what I would do.

1269
01:20:13,561 --> 01:20:17,370
I would do what I'm doing right now into
a mirror and just keep correcting it as

1270
01:20:17,371 --> 01:20:19,380
you go the same way I said,
okay. Don't say fuck there.

1271
01:20:19,381 --> 01:20:24,381
And then you back it up again and just
somehow figured out a way to say that I

1272
01:20:25,351 --> 01:20:27,180
think your girlfriend is a whore.

1273
01:20:30,060 --> 01:20:31,780
I don't think that she's being,
I don't think you're,

1274
01:20:31,890 --> 01:20:35,850
I don't think the woman that you're
with has been a 100% honest with you.

1275
01:20:37,290 --> 01:20:38,790
And I don't think

1276
01:20:40,400 --> 01:20:42,560
that she has been 100% faithful.

1277
01:20:44,240 --> 01:20:48,920
And my gut was telling me that that
wasn't your kid. See, that's brutal.

1278
01:20:49,460 --> 01:20:53,660
Taking it to there. All right. I think
you need to get out of this relationship.

1279
01:20:53,661 --> 01:20:56,150
I mean, I don't do it. I don't know how to
do it. I don't know how to fucking, yeah,

1280
01:20:56,151 --> 01:20:57,950
you stumped me. Stumped the Schwab. Me, I,

1281
01:20:58,090 --> 01:21:00,260
you know now like I know
everything obviously, but uh,

1282
01:21:00,290 --> 01:21:01,700
I usually can come up
with some sort of angle.

1283
01:21:01,701 --> 01:21:06,140
I don't know what the fuck to tell you
what for whatever you do,

1284
01:21:06,170 --> 01:21:07,250
don't write it down.

1285
01:21:07,370 --> 01:21:11,750
Don't put it in a letter
cause he'll probably show it
to her and then, then, uh,

1286
01:21:11,751 --> 01:21:14,510
then it'll just be brutal. The
fuck that. Don't, don't do that.

1287
01:21:14,810 --> 01:21:19,670
Just a huge, that's a uh, yeah.

1288
01:21:19,671 --> 01:21:21,470
I don't want to tell you dude,
that's a fucking brutal one.

1289
01:21:24,330 --> 01:21:27,570
Jesus. Does it work to just
say it? Listen, man, you're
best. We're best friends,

1290
01:21:27,571 --> 01:21:30,750
right? We can say anything to each
other. Yeah. I think your girlfriend, uh,

1291
01:21:30,810 --> 01:21:35,810
fuck somebody else without a condom and
got pregnant and said it was yours and

1292
01:21:35,940 --> 01:21:40,680
it's such a fucking psycho cunt that she
was about ready to let you take on the

1293
01:21:40,681 --> 01:21:44,460
responsibility and invest
that sort of time, your life.

1294
01:21:44,610 --> 01:21:48,960
She was content to throw away your
fucking life because she can't keep her

1295
01:21:48,961 --> 01:21:52,740
fucking legs on the ground and our
panties up around a fucking waste.

1296
01:21:53,460 --> 01:21:54,360
Do you understand me?

1297
01:21:57,760 --> 01:22:00,550
She's a fucking whore.
All right.

1298
01:22:01,270 --> 01:22:04,660
You went to two fucking doctors and
they said you can't get pregnant, dude.

1299
01:22:04,780 --> 01:22:05,860
How dumb are you?

1300
01:22:07,280 --> 01:22:12,020
Get your fucking head out of her fucking
vagina. Wake up. It's not your kid.

1301
01:22:12,670 --> 01:22:16,850
All right. That was God. God gave you
a fucking Mulligan. He gave me a pass.

1302
01:22:16,851 --> 01:22:19,070
All right. They go, you
want to get old? Jesus.

1303
01:22:19,071 --> 01:22:23,420
You want to get fucking religious about
it? Get out of the goddamn relationship.

1304
01:22:24,170 --> 01:22:26,240
Stop being such a fucking pussy.

1305
01:22:27,830 --> 01:22:28,663
Leave her

1306
01:22:29,580 --> 01:22:32,700
cry about it for fucking six weeks.
Whatever you gotta do,

1307
01:22:32,701 --> 01:22:36,480
go join a fucking gym and get on with
your fucking life and start wearing a

1308
01:22:36,481 --> 01:22:40,350
condom.
All right.

1309
01:22:41,010 --> 01:22:44,820
Now I know that team that we saw in the
first half is not the fuck attain that.

1310
01:22:44,821 --> 01:22:46,670
I know.
Well,

1311
01:22:46,780 --> 01:22:50,250
we got enough 30 minutes of fucking
football and I want you to get out there.

1312
01:22:50,510 --> 01:22:53,400
It proved to me that you could play and
I got the way. I know you could play.

1313
01:22:53,820 --> 01:22:56,670
That's what you do. You got there where
we go. It took me a minute to work it out.

1314
01:22:56,730 --> 01:23:00,670
You go fucking Vince Lombardi, grab, grab,

1315
01:23:00,671 --> 01:23:01,960
grab nobody tackling.

1316
01:23:02,780 --> 01:23:03,030
Okay.

1317
01:23:03,030 --> 01:23:06,040
She's a fucking whore. You gotta go
like Dad. You've got to build up. You've

1318
01:23:06,040 --> 01:23:09,660
got to start slow.
You got to start slow.

1319
01:23:09,830 --> 01:23:11,790
Oh my years are looking at relationships.

1320
01:23:11,791 --> 01:23:15,810
I don't think I have ever
in my life seen a woman.

1321
01:23:17,280 --> 01:23:19,200
So pull the fucking wall,

1322
01:23:19,320 --> 01:23:24,030
a pubes over somebody's fucking
eyes like I did at first half.

1323
01:23:26,270 --> 01:23:29,450
You know what I saw out there?
I saw bullshit. Just some,

1324
01:23:29,451 --> 01:23:31,340
I don't know how to do it. I'm
out. I don't know what to tell you.

1325
01:23:32,600 --> 01:23:34,910
I don't know what to tell you.
Tell that fucking kid.

1326
01:23:34,911 --> 01:23:39,340
He needs to make some halftime
adjustments. All right, pull the ripcord.

1327
01:23:39,410 --> 01:23:44,240
Get the fuck out of that gene as well.
See these,

1328
01:23:44,241 --> 01:23:46,460
these, these are the things
they, they don't, they don't,

1329
01:23:46,850 --> 01:23:51,260
they don't talk about these kinds of,
of, of women on, on those real shows.

1330
01:23:51,261 --> 01:23:54,200
They'll show women like that on Jerry
Springer and everyone looks like a retard,

1331
01:23:54,201 --> 01:23:58,520
so nobody gives a fuck. Right? But they
won't show those kinds of women on those.

1332
01:23:58,521 --> 01:24:02,030
Those real sort of issue shows when
they're just always talking about guys who

1333
01:24:02,031 --> 01:24:02,751
beat their women,

1334
01:24:02,751 --> 01:24:05,810
which they're horrible fucking people
and they should talk about them.

1335
01:24:05,960 --> 01:24:09,500
But why don't they ever talk about horse?
You know,

1336
01:24:09,710 --> 01:24:13,340
the only time they talk about whores
is just when they try to figure out why

1337
01:24:13,540 --> 01:24:15,440
there a whore.
You know,

1338
01:24:15,590 --> 01:24:20,300
dad didn't stick around fucking uncle
dental, Domo, you know, whatever.

1339
01:24:20,301 --> 01:24:24,080
They always got a fucking reason. Now
he's got a goddamn excuse. You know?

1340
01:24:25,040 --> 01:24:26,930
Maybe they're just horse.
You ever think of that?

1341
01:24:26,931 --> 01:24:29,480
I think there's already women out there
as a woman out there when I want to know

1342
01:24:29,481 --> 01:24:30,320
this.
Okay,

1343
01:24:30,321 --> 01:24:34,160
this is totally anonymous and I'm not
judging you because I'm a male whore

1344
01:24:34,161 --> 01:24:38,240
myself. All right? I want to know this.

1345
01:24:39,170 --> 01:24:43,850
Is there a woman out there with dad
stuck around? You had a great family.

1346
01:24:44,930 --> 01:24:47,570
You weren't touched in any funny way.
You went to school,

1347
01:24:48,230 --> 01:24:51,170
you know you are girl scouts,
you did all the right things,

1348
01:24:52,070 --> 01:24:55,580
but you just love Dick.
And not only do you love Dick,

1349
01:24:55,581 --> 01:25:00,380
you love a bunch of different dicks
and you are in a relationship,

1350
01:25:00,381 --> 01:25:03,380
but every once in awhile you just got
to go out and go back somebody else

1351
01:25:04,160 --> 01:25:07,550
because you're fucking bored basically.

1352
01:25:07,551 --> 01:25:11,930
Are you wired like a man?
That's what I want to know.

1353
01:25:13,070 --> 01:25:16,970
Okay. And you can be totally
honest. Let's examine.

1354
01:25:18,050 --> 01:25:21,980
Let's examine that because I don't even
think it's fair to just brand them all

1355
01:25:22,520 --> 01:25:24,670
horse.
I don't,

1356
01:25:24,910 --> 01:25:28,090
I think some of them are raw,

1357
01:25:28,930 --> 01:25:32,520
actually really intelligent and they've
actually sat and contemplated it,

1358
01:25:33,690 --> 01:25:35,200
Jeff or you know,
done.

1359
01:25:35,201 --> 01:25:39,400
What I've done is justify
their piece of shit moves.

1360
01:25:45,530 --> 01:25:48,510
Ah, you know something. This is the time
when I really should just have a guest.

1361
01:25:48,540 --> 01:25:51,630
I don't have a guest. I got to have
more guests on this fucking podcast.

1362
01:25:51,631 --> 01:25:53,820
What do a what? Do what do? What do you,
what do you want from me? All right.

1363
01:25:53,821 --> 01:25:56,100
You guys want some youtube
videos for this week? Huh?

1364
01:25:56,160 --> 01:25:58,560
Have you slumped over and
your cubicles left yet?

1365
01:25:58,590 --> 01:26:02,160
Have you done that with five minutes
left and you fucking day. All right.

1366
01:26:02,161 --> 01:26:05,630
Youtube videos for the week. Uh,
the truth about Facebook privacy,

1367
01:26:05,631 --> 01:26:07,430
I actually haven't a
chance to watch this yet.

1368
01:26:07,880 --> 01:26:12,350
This was suggested to me by somebody
close to me, so I just put that on there.

1369
01:26:12,410 --> 01:26:16,640
I hear it go when fireworks fail,
this guy shoots off one that should,

1370
01:26:16,641 --> 01:26:19,130
it should have gone on after
the fucking Boston pops.

1371
01:26:19,260 --> 01:26:21,170
And he basically shoots it
off in his own neighborhood.

1372
01:26:21,171 --> 01:26:25,400
And for some reason it goes off about,
oh, I don't know about maybe 30,

1373
01:26:25,401 --> 01:26:29,990
35 feet in the air, a
bunch of houses around. Um,

1374
01:26:31,190 --> 01:26:35,630
here's another good one. Angry
skateboarder. Here's a hockey one.

1375
01:26:36,890 --> 01:26:41,890
Blonde Jaga is in Jaromir Jaeger
and a band called a mute math.

1376
01:26:42,681 --> 01:26:46,310
Great musicians, great albums, albums,
and they have a fucking insane drummer.

1377
01:26:46,860 --> 01:26:51,750
Oh, speaking of which people,
speaking of which, um,

1378
01:26:52,500 --> 01:26:57,090
I've been taking my drumming to a new
level, to a brand new fucking for me.

1379
01:26:57,450 --> 01:27:01,890
For me, I still suck.
But after plateauing, I,

1380
01:27:02,520 --> 01:27:05,580
uh, I just sort of, I got fucking add,

1381
01:27:05,581 --> 01:27:08,240
right as you could tell from my podcast,
hey,

1382
01:27:08,340 --> 01:27:11,400
have you noticed that I started to make
a point than something else reminds me

1383
01:27:11,401 --> 01:27:14,100
of something else. And then maybe I'll
drive over to the left for a while.

1384
01:27:14,101 --> 01:27:16,740
You know,
I can't sit still,

1385
01:27:16,950 --> 01:27:21,300
I can't focus unless,
uh,

1386
01:27:22,170 --> 01:27:25,990
unless something really fucked
up is happening. That's the only,

1387
01:27:26,140 --> 01:27:31,140
they something really fucked up has to
be happening before you will get 100% of

1388
01:27:32,111 --> 01:27:35,170
my attention,
you know?

1389
01:27:36,400 --> 01:27:39,880
I don't know why, but
that's how it is. So, uh,

1390
01:27:40,270 --> 01:27:44,140
with my playing drums, I'm the
same way. I'm always learning,

1391
01:27:44,220 --> 01:27:47,520
trying to learn five different
things at the same fucking time.

1392
01:27:49,150 --> 01:27:52,880
You know, I'll do this for
like three minutes and I'll
do this for three minutes.

1393
01:27:52,920 --> 01:27:55,880
I'll do this for two minutes and
then, and then I'll fuck, you know,

1394
01:27:55,881 --> 01:28:00,470
and then I have three new things that
I'm trying to learn and rather than just

1395
01:28:00,471 --> 01:28:04,280
learning one and getting it
down, I don't, and, and uh,

1396
01:28:04,820 --> 01:28:08,450
it's something I've known for a while.
I watched this guy, Mike Johnston,

1397
01:28:08,451 --> 01:28:11,960
who has these great
lessons, any, he had this,

1398
01:28:11,961 --> 01:28:14,390
he basically mapped
out on how to practice.

1399
01:28:15,470 --> 01:28:19,040
He teed show you something and it was,
it was pattern.

1400
01:28:19,610 --> 01:28:23,300
You get the pattern down and then you
bring it up to speed and then you'd move

1401
01:28:23,301 --> 01:28:26,150
it all around the kit. So it's
just patterns, speed, movement,

1402
01:28:27,530 --> 01:28:32,510
ABC one, two, three could, couldn't have
got any more basic, but my fucking add,

1403
01:28:32,511 --> 01:28:35,180
I couldn't fucking do it.

1404
01:28:36,110 --> 01:28:39,080
So I finally decided I was fucking sick.

1405
01:28:40,820 --> 01:28:41,780
I was sick of this shit.

1406
01:28:41,781 --> 01:28:45,780
So I just decided to focus on a couple
of things and one of them was at Joe Joe

1407
01:28:45,780 --> 01:28:48,290
May or fucking thing
with your bass drum foot.

1408
01:28:48,620 --> 01:28:51,830
It's something I saw Steve Gadd do.
A lettuce is really for drum heads here.

1409
01:28:53,120 --> 01:28:56,240
Steve Gadd Duwan is up close video a
long time ago and I sat down and I fuck

1410
01:28:56,241 --> 01:28:59,540
with that thing after borderline
messing with it for a year and a half.

1411
01:28:59,780 --> 01:29:04,440
I sat down for like like three days in
a row and religiously worked on it and

1412
01:29:04,650 --> 01:29:09,630
was blown away by how much faster I got
my foot as far as being able to do three

1413
01:29:09,631 --> 01:29:14,330
hits in a row because I'm Ah,
who's kidding who?

1414
01:29:15,410 --> 01:29:18,330
Any Zeppelin fans out there?
There's two licks,

1415
01:29:18,990 --> 01:29:22,980
three licks that I've been
trying to get down. Okay.

1416
01:29:22,981 --> 01:29:26,130
I finally be able to get the good
times, bad times, 16th note, triplets.

1417
01:29:26,130 --> 01:29:29,610
I can do those fucking things up to
speed. I can play good times, bad times,

1418
01:29:30,300 --> 01:29:34,740
but when he does the three in a
row like that, licky does on a,

1419
01:29:35,880 --> 01:29:37,080
I can't quit you babe.

1420
01:29:38,380 --> 01:29:42,400
When he does the three in a
row there and out on the tiles,

1421
01:29:43,480 --> 01:29:45,490
there's a lick in there where I think,

1422
01:29:45,520 --> 01:29:47,740
I think I'm hearing three
and then the want and soc,

1423
01:29:48,640 --> 01:29:52,210
which is a big debate on how to this is
so fucking is I'm really going to lose a

1424
01:29:52,211 --> 01:29:53,044
lot of listeners here,

1425
01:29:54,040 --> 01:29:57,400
but there's a big debate on
how the fuck he plays that.

1426
01:29:58,090 --> 01:30:02,140
Does he pay bone that the debt, the debt
or done that? The debt that the debt,

1427
01:30:02,170 --> 01:30:05,860
I think he does three after the snare,
he and uh,

1428
01:30:05,890 --> 01:30:08,980
on the to us is so fucking stupid.
Why am I talking about this anyways?

1429
01:30:09,160 --> 01:30:11,260
What that Jojo Mayor Shit.
Okay.

1430
01:30:11,261 --> 01:30:14,320
They play that at about 101
hundred two beats per minute,

1431
01:30:14,390 --> 01:30:17,950
but that Jojo mayor thinks I can play
that lick with the three hits on the Bass

1432
01:30:17,950 --> 01:30:22,180
Drum after the snare on too.
I can play that at 90 beats per minute.

1433
01:30:24,020 --> 01:30:24,853
MMM.

1434
01:30:25,130 --> 01:30:26,820
Permanent. Yeah. I can play
it at data at this point.

1435
01:30:26,821 --> 01:30:30,480
So I'm within fucking striking
distance of that after, you know,

1436
01:30:30,510 --> 01:30:34,230
fucking with this thing for a year
and a half, finally just sitting down.

1437
01:30:35,700 --> 01:30:39,330
Um, and if drummers out there
wasn't any sort of advice,

1438
01:30:39,331 --> 01:30:43,830
I can show you what I did because I'm
just really nervous that this is just,

1439
01:30:43,831 --> 01:30:46,530
I mean, it's already bad enough. I
have people in Europe listens to me,

1440
01:30:46,531 --> 01:30:48,840
go off on American sports
and in Australia and shit.

1441
01:30:49,290 --> 01:30:52,650
For me to actually sit here
and describing drum licks,

1442
01:30:54,610 --> 01:30:59,550
it's pretty fucking pathetic. But, um,
anyways, I think I'm winding down here.

1443
01:30:59,551 --> 01:31:03,030
I got to make sure I edit this thing
and get this thing up on time and I also

1444
01:31:03,031 --> 01:31:07,290
have to make sure, oh my God.
Oh fuck. What time is it?

1445
01:31:08,850 --> 01:31:13,290
I got to go three 15. I gotta be down
at the fucking place to buy four. Fuck.

1446
01:31:13,380 --> 01:31:16,470
All right. I gotta go.
Thanks for listening to the
podcast. Uh, God bless all.

1447
01:31:16,471 --> 01:31:18,380
You don't take any shit.
Go Fuck Yourself. See it.

1448
01:31:45,120 --> 01:31:45,953
[inaudible] [inaudible]

1449
01:31:52,670 --> 01:31:52,670
