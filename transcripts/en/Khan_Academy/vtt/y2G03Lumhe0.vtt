00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:02.319
- In the last video, we worked through

00:00:02.319 --> 00:00:03.966
essentially the probability distribution

00:00:03.966 --> 00:00:06.683
for this random variable defined as

00:00:06.683 --> 00:00:08.378
the number of free throws you make

00:00:08.378 --> 00:00:10.177
when taking size free throws,

00:00:10.177 --> 00:00:12.777
assuming you have a 70
percent free throw percentage,

00:00:12.777 --> 00:00:15.041
and I suggested, hey, why
don't you visualize this?

00:00:15.041 --> 00:00:18.106
Draw the graph of this
probability distribution,

00:00:18.106 --> 00:00:20.405
this binomial probability distribution.

00:00:20.405 --> 00:00:21.519
And when I thought about it, I said,

00:00:21.519 --> 00:00:23.557
well, I too would enjoy graphing it,

00:00:23.557 --> 00:00:24.708
and we might as well do it together,

00:00:24.708 --> 00:00:26.541
because whenever you graph these things

00:00:26.541 --> 00:00:27.563
it makes it very visual,

00:00:27.563 --> 00:00:31.765
and kind of the shape of a
binomial distribution like this.

00:00:31.765 --> 00:00:33.614
So let's do that.

00:00:33.614 --> 00:00:37.132
So let me maybe move over
to the right a little bit,

00:00:37.132 --> 00:00:38.177
I really just need to
be able to keep track

00:00:38.177 --> 00:00:42.036
of these things right over here.

00:00:42.036 --> 00:00:45.421
Let me draw some lines.

00:00:45.605 --> 00:00:49.983
If I were to just draw one line there,

00:00:49.983 --> 00:00:53.919
and then another line here,

00:00:53.919 --> 00:00:57.064
and then we have the
different percentages.

00:00:57.064 --> 00:00:58.539
So let's do that.

00:00:58.539 --> 00:01:02.359
See, the highest one is
a little over 32 percent.

00:01:02.359 --> 00:01:05.842
So maybe we'll go as
high as 40 percent here.

00:01:05.842 --> 00:01:10.842
40 percent, and then
this would be 20 percent.

00:01:12.077 --> 00:01:15.177
20, that looks about half way, 20 percent.

00:01:15.177 --> 00:01:19.680
This would be 10 percent.

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:23.918
And this would be 30 percent.

00:01:23.918 --> 00:01:27.075
And then in this axis, let's
do the different values

00:01:27.075 --> 00:01:29.583
that the random variable could take on.

00:01:29.583 --> 00:01:33.090
So the random variable taking on

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:35.741
the value zero.

00:01:35.741 --> 00:01:40.280
The random variable
taking on the value one.

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:45.280
Zero, one, the random
variable taking on two.

00:01:46.604 --> 00:01:49.621
Two, we're almost there.

00:01:49.621 --> 00:01:54.621
Let's see, three, and then four.

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:59.687
Four, and then five.

00:01:59.687 --> 00:02:02.729
Five, and then finally six.

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:05.005
Take x equals six.

00:02:05.005 --> 00:02:07.626
And then six, and now let's
just graph all of these.

00:02:07.626 --> 00:02:10.712
So this first one, zero point one percent,

00:02:10.712 --> 00:02:11.851
well, that's barely going to register

00:02:11.851 --> 00:02:13.093
on this graph right here,

00:02:13.093 --> 00:02:14.787
so I'll just kind of
just give it a little bit

00:02:14.787 --> 00:02:16.923
of a showing right over there.

00:02:16.923 --> 00:02:19.153
Showing (mumbles) due to that green color.

00:02:19.153 --> 00:02:21.800
So, let me make sure.

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:23.459
So, in that green color,

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:25.874
you're going to have just
a little bit of a showing.

00:02:25.874 --> 00:02:28.579
One, as well, is kind of barely a showing.

00:02:28.579 --> 00:02:31.790
So it shows up a little bit more.

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:34.957
So let me draw it like that.

00:02:34.957 --> 00:02:37.547
That is one percent, right over there.

00:02:37.547 --> 00:02:40.542
Now, two is six percent,
which on this scale,

00:02:40.542 --> 00:02:44.664
is going to be about that high.

00:02:44.664 --> 00:02:46.522
So let me draw it like that.

00:02:46.522 --> 00:02:48.728
So that is two.

00:02:48.728 --> 00:02:52.301
So that is six percent right there.

00:02:52.301 --> 00:02:55.173
X equaling three, 18
and a half percent shot

00:02:55.173 --> 00:02:56.646
of that happening...

00:02:56.646 --> 00:03:01.646
So 18 and a half, it's a hand drawn chart,

00:03:04.793 --> 00:03:07.585
or histogram, so you have to bear with me.

00:03:07.585 --> 00:03:12.585
So it's roughly there, and then four

00:03:14.928 --> 00:03:19.928
was 32.4 percent, so that is up here.

00:03:20.907 --> 00:03:25.907
So 32.4 percent looks like that.

00:03:28.894 --> 00:03:33.491
Let me shade that in, 32.4 percent.

00:03:33.491 --> 00:03:36.846
And then five was 30.3 percent,

00:03:36.846 --> 00:03:41.793
30.3 percent, slightly
lower, just like that.

00:03:41.793 --> 00:03:46.251
And it will look like this.

00:03:46.251 --> 00:03:51.251
30.3 percent, and finally,
six is 11.8 percent.

00:03:52.635 --> 00:03:53.726
So really, this whole video was just

00:03:53.726 --> 00:03:56.768
an exercise in making a histogram,

00:03:56.768 --> 00:04:01.156
but it's useful, because
to actually visualize

00:04:01.156 --> 00:04:03.055
what the distribution looks like.

00:04:03.055 --> 00:04:04.101
And what's really interesting,

00:04:04.101 --> 00:04:05.934
is to think about how does this change

00:04:05.934 --> 00:04:09.358
as you change the free throw percentage,

00:04:09.358 --> 00:04:11.901
or as you change the
number of shots you take,

00:04:11.901 --> 00:04:16.255
how does this change this
binomial distribution?

00:04:16.255 --> 00:04:17.241
And you can do that on a spreadsheet,

00:04:17.241 --> 00:04:21.757
and actually see how that all works out.
