00:01:50.336 --> 00:01:54.096
&gt;&gt; How do you empower the
constituencies you serve

00:01:54.096 --> 00:01:55.796
and create a healthier community

00:01:55.796 --> 00:01:57.606
through the work
that you do each day?

00:01:58.216 --> 00:02:00.876
So how do you empower
your constituencies

00:02:01.256 --> 00:02:03.766
and create a healthier community
through the work that you do?

00:02:04.896 --> 00:02:06.556
And I'll start again with
Dartanian [assumed spelling].

00:02:06.976 --> 00:02:07.786
&gt;&gt; All right.

00:02:08.636 --> 00:02:11.826
So, at NCLR our mission is to
improve the education health

00:02:11.826 --> 00:02:14.096
and well-being of
youth in communities

00:02:14.096 --> 00:02:16.796
of color specifically
by empowering them

00:02:16.796 --> 00:02:19.606
to enact social change,
through research training

00:02:19.606 --> 00:02:20.776
and community mobilization.

00:02:20.886 --> 00:02:26.706
We focus on what's
called health equity.

00:02:26.706 --> 00:02:31.486
For us, health equity is
about closing disparities

00:02:31.776 --> 00:02:35.006
and closing the gap between
those who do have access

00:02:35.006 --> 00:02:36.576
to resources and
those who do not.

00:02:37.926 --> 00:02:40.796
We believe that all
community should have access

00:02:40.796 --> 00:02:45.946
to fresh whole foods, to a clean
and safe open spaces as well

00:02:45.946 --> 00:02:47.646
as quality medical care.

00:02:47.986 --> 00:02:53.956
In our work we're committed to
helping people build capacity

00:02:53.956 --> 00:02:57.026
so they can make sort of
choices in their lives base

00:02:57.026 --> 00:02:58.906
on the opportunities that
are available that are

00:02:58.906 --> 00:03:00.076
in their own best interest.

00:03:01.456 --> 00:03:03.946
We define food justice

00:03:03.946 --> 00:03:07.756
as communities exercising
their right to grow,

00:03:07.846 --> 00:03:12.896
sell and eat healthy food
that is fresh, nutritious,

00:03:13.006 --> 00:03:16.986
affordable, culturally
appropriate, grown locally,

00:03:16.986 --> 00:03:21.886
with care for the land, for
the people and the animals.

00:03:22.226 --> 00:03:24.976
And so one of the
ways that we work

00:03:24.976 --> 00:03:28.596
to empower our community members
and our residents is first

00:03:28.596 --> 00:03:31.416
by listening to them, so
part of our core values is

00:03:31.416 --> 00:03:33.566
to privilege their
voice and to ensure

00:03:33.706 --> 00:03:37.656
that the things we do are the
things they want to do, right?

00:03:37.886 --> 00:03:40.366
So we bring-- We're able to
bring skills and resources

00:03:40.366 --> 00:03:44.676
to the table but at no point do
we go to folk in our community

00:03:44.676 --> 00:03:45.796
and the community that I'm from

00:03:45.926 --> 00:03:48.106
and tell them this is
what they need to do.

00:03:48.536 --> 00:03:52.406
What we also work to do
is develop social justice

00:03:53.056 --> 00:03:53.706
youth leaders.

00:03:53.706 --> 00:03:55.516
And so we have a
curriculum for our young folk

00:03:55.896 --> 00:03:58.596
where they participate
throughout the entire year

00:03:58.596 --> 00:04:01.266
in classes that are actually
located in their schools

00:04:01.826 --> 00:04:04.536
where they learn about social
justice issues that are relevant

00:04:04.536 --> 00:04:07.536
to them and then they're also
would become critical youth

00:04:07.536 --> 00:04:09.586
researchers who go
out and teach others

00:04:09.826 --> 00:04:13.286
about what they both
discover but conduct research

00:04:13.286 --> 00:04:15.196
in the community so they
can tell their own story.

00:04:15.766 --> 00:04:18.866
So it's important for us to not
speak for people but to ensure

00:04:18.866 --> 00:04:20.156
that they can speak
for themselves.

00:04:21.426 --> 00:04:25.196
And then we also have a summer
youth fellowship program called

00:04:25.196 --> 00:04:27.396
the Urban Health
Fellows where we work

00:04:27.396 --> 00:04:29.496
with African American
Latino males

00:04:29.496 --> 00:04:33.296
to help them become peer
advocates where they go

00:04:33.296 --> 00:04:36.076
into the community, they not
only conduct this research

00:04:36.076 --> 00:04:39.546
that I mentioned earlier
but they teach their peers

00:04:39.736 --> 00:04:43.446
about the challenges they are
facing about their rising--

00:04:43.676 --> 00:04:46.066
raise of diet related
diseases in Englewood.

00:04:46.276 --> 00:04:49.146
Roughly 47.8% of our
students are classified

00:04:49.146 --> 00:04:50.576
as either being obese
or overweight

00:04:50.576 --> 00:04:52.756
and that's a significant
challenge.

00:04:53.176 --> 00:04:55.426
When we expect it by
2020 that every one

00:04:55.426 --> 00:04:57.856
in two African-Americans
and close to one

00:04:57.856 --> 00:05:01.486
in two Latino students or
youth will have diabetes,

00:05:01.486 --> 00:05:03.856
that's a problem in our
communities and I think one

00:05:03.856 --> 00:05:05.166
of the strategies
that we've been able

00:05:05.166 --> 00:05:10.646
to utilize is having our young
folk actually lead the charge.

00:05:10.816 --> 00:05:13.096
Have them talk to their
peers, talk to their parents.

00:05:14.346 --> 00:05:17.126
We also have what's called
healthy lifestyle centers

00:05:17.636 --> 00:05:21.746
where our community members are
able to participate in health

00:05:21.746 --> 00:05:25.106
and nutrition courses in
classes, they learn how

00:05:25.106 --> 00:05:28.126
to grow their own
food, they learn how

00:05:28.126 --> 00:05:32.276
to plant fruit trees we've
distributed 4600 fruit trees

00:05:32.566 --> 00:05:34.906
creating more fruit
assets in our community.

00:05:35.106 --> 00:05:39.666
We've also been able to plant
400 shade trees addressing urban

00:05:39.666 --> 00:05:41.856
heat island affect in
our community as well

00:05:41.856 --> 00:05:46.196
and have people have spaces to
come together and community both

00:05:46.196 --> 00:05:47.666
through these healthy
life style centers

00:05:48.016 --> 00:05:49.356
and the gardens that
we're building.

00:05:49.356 --> 00:05:52.356
And so for us it's
combination of a few things.

00:05:52.616 --> 00:05:55.456
It's making sure the people
have access to skills and access

00:05:55.486 --> 00:05:57.566
to resources but
it's also assuring

00:05:57.566 --> 00:06:00.066
that their voice is
prioritized in the process

00:06:00.066 --> 00:06:03.866
and then providing the
support that's necessary

00:06:04.086 --> 00:06:06.306
to enact change within
the community.

00:06:06.526 --> 00:06:10.276
So it's fundamentally
about lifting up people

00:06:10.276 --> 00:06:12.576
in our community so
that they can live.

00:06:14.306 --> 00:06:16.396
&gt;&gt; So I think that's
probably the reason why Dart

00:06:16.396 --> 00:06:18.576
and I are both on the
leadership boarder that I

00:06:18.806 --> 00:06:21.446
like to call it the council.

00:06:21.446 --> 00:06:25.036
The work that he and social
justice learning is doing

00:06:25.036 --> 00:06:28.516
in Englewood is very so much to
our sort of philosophy interior

00:06:28.516 --> 00:06:29.976
of social change, right?

00:06:30.086 --> 00:06:32.706
So, we believe at the future
working alliance that those

00:06:32.706 --> 00:06:36.356
who are marginalized, those
who are facing the problems

00:06:36.356 --> 00:06:37.796
and issues in their communities,

00:06:37.796 --> 00:06:39.276
in their workplace
should be the ones

00:06:39.276 --> 00:06:42.266
in the leadership developing
the solutions to those problems

00:06:42.776 --> 00:06:45.496
and organizing, right,
to make those changes.

00:06:46.046 --> 00:06:49.636
And so the work that we do
is really supporting the work

00:06:49.636 --> 00:06:51.166
of our member organizations.

00:06:51.166 --> 00:06:53.796
We have 23 member who
works around the country,

00:06:53.986 --> 00:06:57.036
some are representing farm
workers, others are organizing

00:06:57.036 --> 00:06:59.326
with food, I mean culture
process team workers,

00:06:59.326 --> 00:07:02.016
warehouse workers, grocery
workers, restaurant workers,

00:07:02.016 --> 00:07:04.846
street vendors all
throughout the chain.

00:07:05.156 --> 00:07:08.406
And so we support their
organizing campaigns, right?

00:07:08.406 --> 00:07:10.786
Through organizing campaigns,
these workers are making changes

00:07:10.786 --> 00:07:12.986
in their communities, in
their workplaces, you know,

00:07:12.986 --> 00:07:16.906
winning raises in the minimum
wage, higher living wages

00:07:16.906 --> 00:07:21.696
in their workplaces and we
also support the leadership

00:07:21.696 --> 00:07:23.086
development of these workers.

00:07:23.216 --> 00:07:27.276
So we have an annual
worker leaders and retreat

00:07:27.466 --> 00:07:30.066
where we bring together
these worker leaders

00:07:30.116 --> 00:07:32.156
from our different
member organizations

00:07:32.156 --> 00:07:33.656
and they share their
experiences,

00:07:33.656 --> 00:07:36.086
they share their stories,
they got to know each other

00:07:36.086 --> 00:07:39.186
and really build this
movement of food worker, right,

00:07:39.186 --> 00:07:41.946
because you need to
develop those relationships

00:07:41.946 --> 00:07:42.826
to build a movement.

00:07:42.826 --> 00:07:46.696
And so at those retreats
we also invite folks

00:07:46.766 --> 00:07:49.596
to share their skills,
need workshops,

00:07:49.836 --> 00:07:51.666
learn how to tell
their stories somewhere

00:07:51.776 --> 00:07:53.826
to what you were talking about
Dart, right, to be able to speak

00:07:53.826 --> 00:07:58.436
up for themselves and to talk
about what are the solutions

00:07:58.436 --> 00:08:01.646
that they want to work towards
and then work in the lines

00:08:01.646 --> 00:08:03.246
through to support that.

00:08:03.246 --> 00:08:06.846
So they are part of planning
for what we do in the line.

00:08:07.276 --> 00:08:11.156
Our retreat last year,
they came up with this idea

00:08:11.156 --> 00:08:14.336
of a new training program
so that they can learn more

00:08:14.336 --> 00:08:16.746
in depth about what are the
issue facing all the workers

00:08:16.746 --> 00:08:18.876
throughout the food
system and not just workers

00:08:18.876 --> 00:08:21.786
in their own sector, and
also what is this food

00:08:21.786 --> 00:08:22.776
justice movement?

00:08:22.776 --> 00:08:24.366
How can they get connected?

00:08:24.366 --> 00:08:27.236
What are the other issues
that they've been still face

00:08:27.236 --> 00:08:30.336
but maybe haven't
made the connections

00:08:30.336 --> 00:08:32.176
yet to their issues as workers?

00:08:32.176 --> 00:08:33.386
And so we're going

00:08:33.386 --> 00:08:36.726
to be starting a pilot
program this year.

00:08:37.636 --> 00:08:40.916
In addition, they want to
learn about the history

00:08:40.916 --> 00:08:43.506
of the food system, how we
got into where we are today

00:08:43.846 --> 00:08:46.806
and how has raised in
labor in class, you know,

00:08:46.806 --> 00:08:50.236
gender issues all played into
why we have this current,

00:08:50.236 --> 00:08:53.836
you know, corporate industrial
food system that's exploding

00:08:53.836 --> 00:08:56.956
workers in the environment,
in our communities

00:08:56.956 --> 00:08:59.206
and then how can we
organize to turn that around,

00:08:59.326 --> 00:09:03.636
so that's the whole
bit that folk can do.

[ Foreign Language ]

00:09:14.796 --> 00:09:19.336
&gt;&gt; So, in our area we work
more with parents and family.

00:09:19.336 --> 00:09:22.516
In their family some
we basically work a lot

00:09:22.576 --> 00:09:23.346
with the mothers.

00:09:24.636 --> 00:09:48.836
[ Foreign Language ]

00:09:49.336 --> 00:09:53.136
So we basically try to work
with them in issues related

00:09:53.136 --> 00:09:57.246
to housing not only to issues
in the field and we also try

00:09:57.246 --> 00:10:00.696
to educate them that because
they don't speak the language

00:10:00.696 --> 00:10:01.476
they don't have right.

00:10:01.876 --> 00:10:03.986
They have rights
to a descent job,

00:10:03.986 --> 00:10:05.576
they have rights to housing.

00:10:06.636 --> 00:10:16.666
[ Foreign Language ]

00:10:17.166 --> 00:10:22.036
We are several census,
we're coworkers

00:10:22.146 --> 00:10:26.096
who are promoters have direct
contact with the families.

00:10:26.636 --> 00:10:43.176
[ Foreign Language ]

00:10:43.676 --> 00:10:46.966
So we basically talk about
the bound nutrition, you know,

00:10:46.966 --> 00:10:50.106
and that we also
talk about obesity,

00:10:50.236 --> 00:10:54.106
diabetes which are issues very
common in our Latin community,

00:10:54.106 --> 00:10:56.866
so we try to educate
them around those issues.

00:10:57.636 --> 00:11:20.036
[ Foreign Language ]

00:11:20.536 --> 00:11:24.746
So we'd also try to educate them
about how to cook, you know,

00:11:25.016 --> 00:11:27.776
food that are typical
of our communities

00:11:27.776 --> 00:11:28.946
which are really healthy

00:11:29.406 --> 00:11:32.566
and even though sometimes we
cannot get the right products

00:11:32.566 --> 00:11:35.796
or the ingredients but that
we can still cook healthy.

00:11:36.636 --> 00:11:56.556
[ Foreign Language ]

00:11:57.056 --> 00:11:59.626
So this is mainly what
we try to make them see

00:11:59.626 --> 00:12:01.586
and also we give
them information

00:12:01.586 --> 00:12:05.056
about where they can find
some produce that is typical

00:12:05.056 --> 00:12:06.836
of their-- our traditional food

00:12:06.836 --> 00:12:09.686
so that they can have
a better nutrition.

[ Foreign Language ]

00:12:33.546 --> 00:12:36.746
So we also try to work with the
mothers and make them understand

00:12:36.926 --> 00:12:40.096
that sometimes in this
country there are laws

00:12:40.446 --> 00:12:43.126
that are very different from
the laws in our community.

00:12:43.126 --> 00:12:46.156
Sometimes we have to learn how
to respect those laws and also

00:12:46.156 --> 00:12:49.126
to use them for our
wellness and well-being.

is really a great question

00:12:57.866 --> 00:13:02.886
and that I won't speak about
how we're directly affecting the

00:13:02.886 --> 00:13:05.816
change but how we're influencing
the change and what we believe

00:13:05.816 --> 00:13:07.216

00:13:20.056 --> 00:13:23.066
together with the health
communications course has been

00:13:23.066 --> 00:13:26.176
working in a project that's
known as [foreign language],

00:13:26.176 --> 00:13:30.886
that means Restoring
our Traditional Diet

00:13:31.286 --> 00:13:32.296
to Create Greater Health.

00:13:33.346 --> 00:13:35.746
We began by asking
community, first of all,

00:13:35.746 --> 00:13:36.876
one quest-- two questions.

00:13:37.151 --> 00:13:39.151
[ Foreign Language ]

00:13:39.166 --> 00:13:42.416
What is that that you used
to eat in your community?

00:13:42.506 --> 00:13:43.156
And when we're speaking

00:13:43.156 --> 00:13:45.086
about community its
community back home

00:13:45.086 --> 00:13:46.576
in Oaxaca, your homeland.

00:13:47.636 --> 00:13:49.676
[ Foreign Language ]

00:13:50.176 --> 00:13:52.866
How did your diet
change while being here?

00:13:53.496 --> 00:13:55.736
And we asked these
questions in order

00:13:55.736 --> 00:13:59.926
to really remember the value
of our diets and what it has

00:13:59.926 --> 00:14:00.966
to influence in community

00:14:00.966 --> 00:14:02.626
and how can you conserve
these traditions

00:14:03.126 --> 00:14:04.316
and where did they come from?

00:14:05.386 --> 00:14:07.716
And so that we can conserve
them, continue to conserve them

00:14:07.946 --> 00:14:09.756
so we can continue to
teach it to our children

00:14:10.166 --> 00:14:11.646
and their children
to their children.

00:14:11.646 --> 00:14:15.246
We can now put a couple of
recipe examples just to throw

00:14:15.246 --> 00:14:17.306
out a little bit of
what this context means.

00:14:17.786 --> 00:14:20.776
So there is a couple of
things that I've note,

00:14:20.776 --> 00:14:28.146
there's for example a recipe
could be [foreign language]

00:14:28.636 --> 00:14:29.426
or [foreign language] or
[foreign language], they're kind

00:14:29.426 --> 00:14:34.276
of like asparagus with some
sarsa and [foreign language].

00:14:34.386 --> 00:14:38.376
You see, in Oaxaca, their
diet really does consist

00:14:38.376 --> 00:14:39.866
of [foreign language],
kind of like stir-fries,

00:14:39.866 --> 00:14:43.106
and what is seasonally
available.

00:14:43.486 --> 00:14:46.396
So, through those practices,
you're able to really reach

00:14:46.396 --> 00:14:47.546
out to where nurtures you

00:14:47.546 --> 00:14:49.466
through the abundance
of the time.

00:14:49.466 --> 00:14:52.896
So, during the months of May
through October ,that's the time

00:14:52.896 --> 00:14:55.076
when there's a lot of grains
and it's really growing

00:14:55.076 --> 00:15:03.466
in the forest and really
abundant and there's a lot

00:15:03.986 --> 00:15:08.766
of plants and grains and
herbs and there's plants

00:15:08.766 --> 00:15:11.296
like [foreign language] and
the list goes on and on.

00:15:11.296 --> 00:15:15.246
And this is-- for example
in the [foreign language],

00:15:15.456 --> 00:15:20.036
there's a lot of access to
what's sustainable there.

00:15:20.036 --> 00:15:22.426
It's already growing
in abundance everyday

00:15:22.426 --> 00:15:23.956
through the forest and go

00:15:23.956 --> 00:15:26.266
and you harvest the
crickets and the ants.

00:15:26.266 --> 00:15:27.526
I've tried them and
they're delicious.

00:15:28.986 --> 00:15:32.086
And anything like that and
you share it with community

00:15:32.086 --> 00:15:33.266
and you share with your family.

00:15:33.476 --> 00:15:36.556
I'm sure all of you care
about your own personal health

00:15:36.556 --> 00:15:38.276
but I'm sure you
also have your family

00:15:38.516 --> 00:15:40.476
and you also have a
community type so that--

00:15:40.536 --> 00:15:42.446
so when we speak
about sustainability,

00:15:42.596 --> 00:15:44.406
that's not only how
it's affecting community

00:15:44.406 --> 00:15:45.546
but how it's affecting you

00:15:45.546 --> 00:15:47.046
because everything
in interrelated.

00:15:47.046 --> 00:15:49.226
And just to let you
know a little bit

00:15:49.226 --> 00:15:52.146
about the indigenous community
of Oaxaca and Guerrero in Pueblo

00:15:52.676 --> 00:15:55.176
and these Mexican
indigenous people.

00:15:55.176 --> 00:15:56.686
And generally, they
are deeply rooted

00:15:56.686 --> 00:15:58.696
in sustainable practices
already.

00:15:59.306 --> 00:16:02.646
There's a great ancestral
wisdom, ancient wisdom

00:16:02.786 --> 00:16:04.306
that goes back centuries.

00:16:05.176 --> 00:16:06.806
And so when we really
take a look at that,

00:16:06.806 --> 00:16:10.316
we're able to really practice
if we were really just use

00:16:10.316 --> 00:16:13.276
as an example whereas in
social inspiration we'd be able

00:16:13.276 --> 00:16:15.126
to create greater
sustainable practices.

00:16:16.066 --> 00:16:17.936
And so-- But unfortunately

00:16:17.936 --> 00:16:20.476
as we know that's vastly
disappearing due to NAFTA,

00:16:20.906 --> 00:16:23.316
the North American Free Trade
Agreement as we all know.

00:16:23.916 --> 00:16:26.496
Farmers who used to sell, Eden
[assumed spelling] was talking

00:16:26.496 --> 00:16:27.666
to me on the road I use

00:16:27.666 --> 00:16:30.076
to go your own fruit
are no longer able

00:16:30.076 --> 00:16:31.676
to complete with
big monoculture.

00:16:31.746 --> 00:16:35.006
Farmers who come into the
territories, we have some

00:16:35.006 --> 00:16:38.716
of the richest and most
biodiverse areas in the world.

00:16:39.726 --> 00:16:43.686
And so, with that this
is creating a huge flock

00:16:43.756 --> 00:16:44.646
in migration.

00:16:45.046 --> 00:16:50.166
And so-- The flock is also
affecting ancestral lands

00:16:50.166 --> 00:16:51.216
and tradition itself.

00:16:52.266 --> 00:16:55.646
And so our community is shifting
their cultural practices

00:16:55.646 --> 00:16:56.976
when they come to the US.

00:16:57.326 --> 00:17:00.516
So, no longer are they able to
keep their tradition of ways

00:17:00.516 --> 00:17:04.736
and living, they have to adjust
to new traditional-- new ways.

00:17:04.906 --> 00:17:08.746
They have to navigate
unstable working environments.

00:17:08.866 --> 00:17:11.516
They earn minimum wage
in order to survive.

00:17:11.516 --> 00:17:13.406
At the same time
they're learning

00:17:13.406 --> 00:17:15.576
to navigate the social
educational legal

00:17:15.576 --> 00:17:19.236
and medical systems without the
help of their native language

00:17:19.236 --> 00:17:21.816
and our organization we
really do all of our staff,

00:17:21.816 --> 00:17:24.936
90% of our staff is indigenous
and speaks the native language

00:17:24.936 --> 00:17:26.286
in order to support
that community.

00:17:27.156 --> 00:17:29.806
So even though they're
working the very lands

00:17:29.806 --> 00:17:33.136
that sustain everyone else,
it is not sustaining them.

00:17:34.356 --> 00:17:37.306
And so the food that they
should be able to access,

00:17:37.306 --> 00:17:39.986
accessible organic food
or traditional food is--

00:17:40.146 --> 00:17:42.186
there isn't enough
growing spaces not even

00:17:42.246 --> 00:17:47.816
in our backyards, little and
like the city and they earn less

00:17:47.816 --> 00:17:50.516
than 15,000 and less
than 20,000 a year

00:17:50.586 --> 00:17:54.506
so that means every week you're
having to spend around 150

00:17:54.506 --> 00:17:59.836
to $250 a week just to earn--
just to buy food itself.

00:17:59.836 --> 00:18:02.086
And most of it, from what
I learned is the food

00:18:02.086 --> 00:18:04.116
that you harvested yourself,
you're not even able--

00:18:04.116 --> 00:18:05.926
even able to buy that.

00:18:06.456 --> 00:18:08.726
So it's very costly.

00:18:09.006 --> 00:18:11.746
It affects as we
know every level.

00:18:11.746 --> 00:18:16.976
And then the most sad
thing about this is that,

00:18:17.436 --> 00:18:20.406
back in Oaxaca and
Guerrero and Pueblo,

00:18:20.766 --> 00:18:24.066
these communities are constantly
being bombarded by Coca-cola

00:18:24.556 --> 00:18:24.766
by [foreign language].

00:18:25.086 --> 00:18:28.186
It's easier to go ahead and
get a couple of Coca-cola

00:18:28.186 --> 00:18:31.136
or something than to get
access to clean water.

00:18:31.136 --> 00:18:33.566
Or it's easier to get a bag

00:18:33.566 --> 00:18:36.586
of [foreign language] you see
it here as would been known

00:18:36.586 --> 00:18:37.236
as [foreign language],

00:18:37.366 --> 00:18:39.616
some [foreign language] some
[foreign language], you know,

00:18:39.616 --> 00:18:42.886
than to be able to grab fruits
and vegetables on the go.

00:18:43.436 --> 00:18:46.806
So, I was recently in Sonora,
Mexico and there I was able

00:18:46.806 --> 00:18:50.236
to go to the local market
and the local grocery stores

00:18:50.756 --> 00:18:54.646
and guess what I saw, I saw
mountains and piles of pears

00:18:54.646 --> 00:18:57.606
and fruits and vegetables
and they were all the ones

00:18:57.606 --> 00:19:00.046
that were discarded from the
United States and sold their

00:19:00.046 --> 00:19:02.766
for almost double the
price and they were bruised

00:19:02.766 --> 00:19:05.616
and they were old and there's
a whole bunch of things in it

00:19:05.616 --> 00:19:08.176
and most likely I'm sure
they're genetically modified,

00:19:08.176 --> 00:19:09.876
and that's another
issue in itself.

00:19:10.706 --> 00:19:14.856
But nearly, our question is
really how has really revolved

00:19:14.856 --> 00:19:17.496
right now and how do we
restore traditional practices?

00:19:18.886 --> 00:19:20.896
How do we bring that
indigenous wisdom back?

00:19:21.716 --> 00:19:24.456
How do we bring it and so
that we value those ways

00:19:24.456 --> 00:19:26.636
in our little enhanced
community?

00:19:27.056 --> 00:19:28.876
And also we know that
we'll never going

00:19:28.876 --> 00:19:33.526
to reach an idealized way of
living and eating and cooking

00:19:33.526 --> 00:19:35.626
because those various
vegetables,

00:19:35.686 --> 00:19:38.846
herbs are no longer accessible
here, they're being shipped.

00:19:38.846 --> 00:19:41.476
When I get to be able to share
in a table with my colleagues

00:19:41.476 --> 00:19:43.496
and I'm able to eat those
[foreign language] instead

00:19:43.496 --> 00:19:48.466
of ants, they had to be
shipped up from Oaxaca

00:19:49.056 --> 00:19:51.216
and that's the only
reason I'm able to do that.

00:19:51.696 --> 00:19:54.376
But we're losing those bases.

00:19:55.156 --> 00:19:58.366
And so what we learned
more recently is that we're

00:19:58.366 --> 00:20:01.736
in the process of creating
a mystic cultural heritage

00:20:01.736 --> 00:20:04.596
cookbook so that the families
we'd been able to serve

00:20:04.596 --> 00:20:06.846
with the families, we've been
able to restore some of that

00:20:06.846 --> 00:20:09.266
and there's a couple of
markets they can still find

00:20:09.266 --> 00:20:10.316
these ingredients.

00:20:10.526 --> 00:20:13.426
And just timewise, I just
want to say that we do have

00:20:13.426 --> 00:20:16.116
to maintain continue
to save our seeds,

00:20:16.116 --> 00:20:18.116
continue to teach our
young and continue

00:20:18.116 --> 00:20:19.636
to gather wisdom
from our elders.

00:20:20.276 --> 00:20:22.236
And the more we learn
about what sustain us,

00:20:22.236 --> 00:20:24.116
the more we learn
about ourselves.

00:20:24.736 --> 00:20:25.996
Thank you so much for your time.

00:20:27.896 --> 00:20:32.066
&gt;&gt; So, before I talk about
what I do, I think I want

00:20:32.066 --> 00:20:33.916
to talk a little bit
about why I do it.

00:20:34.026 --> 00:20:36.436
Because intentions are
really, really important

00:20:36.436 --> 00:20:39.536
in forming our passions and
continuing the work that we do.

00:20:39.536 --> 00:20:42.116
And, specially as young
advocates and activist,

00:20:42.246 --> 00:20:44.206
and making sure we
don't have burnout

00:20:44.206 --> 00:20:45.846
because they continually
reminds you

00:20:46.016 --> 00:20:49.346
of why you have those early
mornings and late nights.

00:20:49.346 --> 00:20:53.676
So, as a Muslim, we have a
annual month, well obviously.

00:20:53.716 --> 00:20:58.696
It's a month one out of a year
where we fast from dust to dawn.

00:20:58.696 --> 00:21:01.486
And, since the Islamic
calendars are lunar calendar,

00:21:01.486 --> 00:21:02.326
it changes throughout the year.

00:21:02.466 --> 00:21:07.606
So, we fast from sometimes
3:30 am to 8 pm like this year

00:21:07.606 --> 00:21:11.316
when the day was about 17,
16-- 16 or 17 hours long.

00:21:11.756 --> 00:21:13.766
And you don't just do
that one day or two.

00:21:13.766 --> 00:21:15.346
You do that for 30 days.

00:21:15.816 --> 00:21:18.476
And, you stay away from food
and drink and you're supposed

00:21:18.476 --> 00:21:21.126
to be the best version of
yourself that you can be.

00:21:21.126 --> 00:21:24.386
And, it's kind of a
training opportunity for you

00:21:24.386 --> 00:21:28.036
to really evaluate yourself
and why you do what you do

00:21:28.036 --> 00:21:29.246
and just make yourself
a better person.

00:21:29.246 --> 00:21:33.086
And during these days, oh man,
you really feel the hunger.

00:21:33.086 --> 00:21:36.686
And the whole point of Ramadan
is so that you can empathize

00:21:36.686 --> 00:21:38.236
with the people that
have less than yourself.

00:21:39.046 --> 00:21:40.656
What I find as I grow older

00:21:40.656 --> 00:21:42.846
and I'm part different
social circles is

00:21:42.846 --> 00:21:46.226
that we spend all day
hungry and thirsty

00:21:46.226 --> 00:21:48.216
and then we all get
together around the table

00:21:48.216 --> 00:21:51.066
of extravagant food
and just feast

00:21:51.066 --> 00:21:52.376
until we all have a food coma.

00:21:52.446 --> 00:21:56.466
And that is totally beyond
and missing the point

00:21:56.466 --> 00:21:58.006
of what Ramadan is
supposed to be about.

00:21:58.566 --> 00:22:01.936
And, I didn't really understand
how intense hunger was

00:22:01.936 --> 00:22:05.376
for people who actually
experience it on a day

00:22:05.376 --> 00:22:08.536
to day basis until I
visited my home country

00:22:08.536 --> 00:22:09.736
of Pakistan last year.

00:22:09.736 --> 00:22:12.676
I had gone back after 18 years

00:22:12.676 --> 00:22:15.756
and so it was a very
surreal experience for me.

00:22:15.756 --> 00:22:18.906
And right now like, you know,
there are places in California

00:22:18.906 --> 00:22:20.026
where hunger is very apparent.

00:22:20.026 --> 00:22:21.776
And then, there are
places in California

00:22:21.776 --> 00:22:22.666
where hunger is disguised.

00:22:23.386 --> 00:22:26.016
When you go to a developing
country, it is very clear

00:22:26.016 --> 00:22:27.186
who is hungry and who is not.

00:22:27.516 --> 00:22:30.636
And I was able to see people
that were in my family

00:22:30.636 --> 00:22:33.416
that lived in these beautiful
homes and then folks that--

00:22:33.416 --> 00:22:35.436
and people that were also
part of my family that lived

00:22:35.436 --> 00:22:37.176
in the most decrepit

00:22:37.176 --> 00:22:39.156
and horrible housing
commissions that they could.

00:22:39.156 --> 00:22:42.016
And what's worst than that is
you see people on the streets

00:22:42.016 --> 00:22:44.066
who don't have arms
or eyes or legs

00:22:44.066 --> 00:22:46.896
that are begging for
just food to eat.

00:22:46.896 --> 00:22:48.536
And, I came back and
I've been thinking

00:22:48.536 --> 00:22:50.336
about this experience
for the last year.

00:22:50.336 --> 00:22:52.506
I've been thinking about
why I do the work I do

00:22:52.506 --> 00:22:55.506
and how I can kind of help the
circle of people that I'm in.

00:22:55.506 --> 00:22:58.796
And I know that as an
activist and as an advocate,

00:22:58.796 --> 00:23:00.266
I can't change everybody's life.

00:23:00.466 --> 00:23:04.166
Like, I'm very realistic about
the impact that I can make.

00:23:04.196 --> 00:23:06.446
But, I think that if you
allows then this is some

00:23:06.446 --> 00:23:07.276
to prevent this

00:23:07.276 --> 00:23:10.236
from contributing any little
change that we can make.

00:23:10.236 --> 00:23:13.306
Then, we really have missed our
opportunity for social change.

00:23:13.406 --> 00:23:17.156
So, as a student region,
I decided that, you know,

00:23:17.156 --> 00:23:18.666
hunger was a priority of mine.

00:23:18.666 --> 00:23:21.476
You know, I come from
an immigrant family.

00:23:21.546 --> 00:23:25.046
My father certainly was
incredibly poor in Pakistan.

00:23:25.396 --> 00:23:27.796
And, my grandfather had to
travel very far distances

00:23:27.796 --> 00:23:30.546
and move far away to be able
to work to support my family

00:23:30.676 --> 00:23:32.406
and I am standing
it in front of you

00:23:32.406 --> 00:23:34.996
because my father got this
one-in-a-million scholarship

00:23:35.066 --> 00:23:36.156
to come to the United States.

00:23:36.156 --> 00:23:38.326
And then, he moved
his family here.

00:23:38.326 --> 00:23:41.226
So, I think about
poverty and hunger a lot

00:23:41.286 --> 00:23:44.406
because if it weren't for that
scholarship, if it weren't

00:23:44.406 --> 00:23:46.556
for one or two things
that happened in my life

00:23:46.646 --> 00:23:49.666
or in my history then I would
have been one of those people

00:23:49.666 --> 00:23:52.486
that not only has to fast
for 30 days out of the year

00:23:52.486 --> 00:23:55.046
but 365 days out of the year.

00:23:55.046 --> 00:23:59.086
And that is the reality for the
majority of the world out there.

00:23:59.086 --> 00:24:01.786
So when I came back to
Berkley, I started thinking

00:24:01.786 --> 00:24:02.896
about what I need to do.

00:24:02.896 --> 00:24:05.356
And, you know, already the
food pantry was established

00:24:05.356 --> 00:24:07.066
at that time.

00:24:07.066 --> 00:24:09.706
And, we had students that
were solely growing in numbers

00:24:09.706 --> 00:24:12.536
and coming and telling us that
they really appreciated the work

00:24:12.536 --> 00:24:15.376
that Berkley was doing, that
they really needed food.

00:24:15.376 --> 00:24:18.916
And, you know, I have to
say, it's one of the--

00:24:18.916 --> 00:24:21.846
it's an interesting experience
when you have a peer come up

00:24:21.846 --> 00:24:24.646
and tell you that they're
dealing with hunger issues.

00:24:25.106 --> 00:24:30.326
Because, your first reaction is
just one of abhor and sadness

00:24:30.326 --> 00:24:32.326
and just despair because
you just think what,

00:24:32.426 --> 00:24:35.006
like I want to help you,
what can I do to help you

00:24:35.006 --> 00:24:36.276
and what can I do to make sure

00:24:36.276 --> 00:24:38.876
that you don't ever
go hungry again.

00:24:38.876 --> 00:24:42.346
But it's also interestingly
empowering because you realize

00:24:42.346 --> 00:24:44.176
that you are in this
position for a reason.

00:24:44.176 --> 00:24:47.306
And that the work that
you do is not meaningless.

00:24:47.606 --> 00:24:48.926
It really means a lot.

00:24:48.926 --> 00:24:51.166
And even if you can make sure
that one more person is fed

00:24:51.416 --> 00:24:53.386
through whatever effort
you can contribute,

00:24:53.706 --> 00:24:55.516
you've done your job
as a human being.

00:24:56.056 --> 00:24:57.856
So, I know that what
I have control

00:24:57.856 --> 00:24:59.606
over is my current surroundings.

00:24:59.606 --> 00:25:02.116
And as a student region,
I have access to resources

00:25:02.116 --> 00:25:04.046
and administration and data.

00:25:04.046 --> 00:25:08.426
And a number of people that,
sometimes don't realize

00:25:08.426 --> 00:25:11.426
that hunger is a very prominent
thing college campuses.

00:25:11.426 --> 00:25:13.616
When I talk to the
media about this,

00:25:13.716 --> 00:25:14.776
they're completely horrified

00:25:14.826 --> 00:25:17.046
like they literally are
speechless that students

00:25:17.046 --> 00:25:20.736
at the UC in particular are
couch-surfing or showering

00:25:20.736 --> 00:25:22.826
at the gym or living
out at their cars.

00:25:22.826 --> 00:25:25.406
And what's even harder
about this is, is that

00:25:25.406 --> 00:25:27.496
and you know this is actually
horrible but I'm going to come

00:25:27.496 --> 00:25:30.066
out and say it like it's an
awkward conversation for folks

00:25:30.066 --> 00:25:32.656
in power to have because
now it's not, you know,

00:25:32.656 --> 00:25:35.236
the community that everyone
thinks is going hungry anymore.

00:25:35.236 --> 00:25:36.656
Like it's not just, you know,

00:25:36.656 --> 00:25:38.416
like the marginalized
communities of color

00:25:38.416 --> 00:25:39.526
that are going hungry now.

00:25:39.526 --> 00:25:42.486
Now it's an awkward conversation
for a lot of administrators

00:25:42.486 --> 00:25:43.656
and a lot of people in power

00:25:43.656 --> 00:25:45.236
because now it's
the middle class

00:25:45.356 --> 00:25:47.126
that is also experiencing
this hunger.

00:25:47.126 --> 00:25:50.516
And, I think that this
conversation is long

00:25:50.516 --> 00:25:51.406
over due, right?

00:25:51.406 --> 00:25:54.366
Like this has happening for so,
so long but we need to continue

00:25:54.366 --> 00:25:56.766
to make sure that we are
addressing the structures

00:25:56.766 --> 00:26:00.066
that can make this easy
for all of our students.

00:26:00.466 --> 00:26:03.416
So, a big part of what we do is,
we sit down with financial aid,

00:26:03.416 --> 00:26:04.816
we sit down with
dining services,

00:26:04.816 --> 00:26:07.536
we sit down with student
affairs and we try

00:26:07.536 --> 00:26:09.336
to learn what their
processes are like.

00:26:09.696 --> 00:26:10.716
How do you give out aid?

00:26:10.976 --> 00:26:12.086
How do you set your budget?

00:26:12.466 --> 00:26:14.236
What is it that you already do

00:26:14.236 --> 00:26:15.886
and how do we make
our process better?

00:26:16.306 --> 00:26:17.386
So, give one good example,

00:26:17.386 --> 00:26:18.986
I know my time is
kind of running out.

00:26:19.336 --> 00:26:22.526
One of the examples is right
now there is a survey that goes

00:26:22.526 --> 00:26:25.846
out every three years and
students report how much money

00:26:25.846 --> 00:26:27.166
that they budget for food.

00:26:27.616 --> 00:26:30.236
So, they'll say, "We spent
$10 a day, $15 a day,

00:26:30.236 --> 00:26:31.926
whatever for our budget."

00:26:32.556 --> 00:26:34.776
Now, this goes back to
the also the President

00:26:34.776 --> 00:26:37.366
and then we distribute this
data back to the campuses.

00:26:37.366 --> 00:26:38.886
The campuses average
these members

00:26:38.886 --> 00:26:40.956
and then they set the food
budget for financial aid

00:26:40.956 --> 00:26:43.806
and how much they're going
to package out to students.

00:26:43.806 --> 00:26:45.276
Adversely, that number is $9

00:26:45.276 --> 00:26:47.766
and 50 cents per day,
for the entire day.

00:26:48.236 --> 00:26:51.526
That is nowhere nearer
being close to being able

00:26:51.526 --> 00:26:52.656
to encompass an entire meal.

00:26:53.226 --> 00:26:55.726
And so, what we're doing now
is working with the Office

00:26:55.726 --> 00:26:58.416
of the President to see,
are we able to do some kind

00:26:58.416 --> 00:26:59.866
of regional market analysis

00:26:59.946 --> 00:27:01.786
to see what the actual
budget is like.

00:27:01.786 --> 00:27:03.496
And, does that match up
with the current numbers

00:27:03.556 --> 00:27:04.496
that we already have?

00:27:04.956 --> 00:27:06.406
So, what I've learned
through all this is,

00:27:06.406 --> 00:27:09.776
is that addressing hunger
is way beyond just providing

00:27:09.776 --> 00:27:10.376
direct services.

00:27:10.376 --> 00:27:13.016
It's actually addressing
the entire structure

00:27:13.226 --> 00:27:15.056
that allows hunger
to even happen.

00:27:15.536 --> 00:27:20.376
And, I hope and I pray
that, you know, 5 years,

00:27:20.376 --> 00:27:23.246
10 years down the line that
we don't need to, you know,

00:27:23.246 --> 00:27:25.496
have conversations about
folks that are going hungry,

00:27:25.496 --> 00:27:29.096
that we don't need to express
how urgently we need food

00:27:29.096 --> 00:27:32.216
pantries and emergency food
relief programs on our campus.

00:27:32.246 --> 00:27:34.216
Because, ideally, we want
to eradicate hunger, right?

00:27:34.216 --> 00:27:35.216
We want to eradicate hunger.

00:27:35.216 --> 00:27:36.426
We want to heal malnourishment.

00:27:36.746 --> 00:27:37.636
So, we're not there yet.

00:27:37.636 --> 00:27:40.326
And so, these conversations
are really important

00:27:40.326 --> 00:27:43.966
to continue having and I hope
that this somehow can serve

00:27:43.966 --> 00:27:45.876
as a breading ground
for all those

00:27:45.876 --> 00:27:47.176
inspirational conversations.

00:27:47.566 --> 00:27:51.736
But that's a little bit of what
I do, why I do it and I'm hoping

00:27:51.736 --> 00:27:55.226
that all of you will-- and
join me in this operation.

00:27:55.416 --> 00:27:55.696
Thank you.

00:27:56.466 --> 00:27:59.006
&gt;&gt; OK. And just before
Moses starts,

00:27:59.006 --> 00:28:01.106
if you do have any
questions, please go ahead

00:28:01.106 --> 00:28:03.156
and start passing up
those index cards.

00:28:03.156 --> 00:28:05.346
Try not to walk in
front of the camera,

00:28:05.346 --> 00:28:08.346
so walk around the outside
as you bring these up.

00:28:08.346 --> 00:28:10.406
But please start bringing
these up as we hear

00:28:10.406 --> 00:28:11.536
from our last panelist.

00:28:11.746 --> 00:28:12.056
&gt;&gt; Sire.

00:28:12.056 --> 00:28:12.416
&gt;&gt; Thank you, Melissa
[assumed spelling].

00:28:12.446 --> 00:28:14.546
&gt;&gt; So, I want to tell you
a little bit more also

00:28:14.546 --> 00:28:16.576
about why I do what I do.

00:28:17.026 --> 00:28:19.826
And, it can't go without saying
that I'm Jewish-Colombian.

00:28:20.016 --> 00:28:22.116
I was born in Columbia,
I was raised in Miami.

00:28:22.446 --> 00:28:24.676
I was born to a woman who
is blonde and green-eyed.

00:28:25.066 --> 00:28:27.246
And, everybody I knew up to

00:28:27.246 --> 00:28:29.936
like 13 years old
was Jewish-Colombian.

00:28:30.336 --> 00:28:34.546
So, that's kind of a
strange way to see the world

00:28:34.776 --> 00:28:37.096
when you're a kid and you get
to the rest of world or you get

00:28:37.096 --> 00:28:39.566
to California and you find
out you're white like,

00:28:39.566 --> 00:28:41.926
that was a surprise
for me because here

00:28:42.486 --> 00:28:44.956
in Santa Barbara we
have a lot of Hispanics

00:28:45.576 --> 00:28:46.376
which are mostly Mexican.

00:28:46.376 --> 00:28:47.886
And then, we have a
lot of white people.

00:28:48.036 --> 00:28:50.846
And then, we have like the
0.01% of everybody else.

00:28:51.416 --> 00:28:55.166
So, we have a lot of conversions
that are yet to have--

00:28:55.166 --> 00:28:57.336
that we have yet to have.

00:28:57.416 --> 00:29:00.716
But during this whole time,
the language that we have

00:29:00.716 --> 00:29:02.066
in my family is about food.

00:29:02.066 --> 00:29:04.326
Because if you know anything
about Jews and you know anything

00:29:04.326 --> 00:29:05.726
about Colombians,
we like to eat.

00:29:06.186 --> 00:29:07.096
That's for certain.

00:29:07.466 --> 00:29:12.396
And so, but whenever we would
get together as a family,

00:29:12.556 --> 00:29:15.666
whenever we'd be together,
the thing that I always talk

00:29:15.746 --> 00:29:16.616
about would be environment.

00:29:17.416 --> 00:29:22.506
And, my parents, through
that, they supported me

00:29:22.506 --> 00:29:23.596
and they didn't really get it.

00:29:23.596 --> 00:29:26.486
And then, as I study the
environment and I worked

00:29:26.486 --> 00:29:28.706
with the Nature Conservative and
Environmental Defense Center,

00:29:29.206 --> 00:29:31.516
the focus of these
organizations was actually

00:29:32.276 --> 00:29:34.706
on agriculture and
on food policy.

00:29:34.706 --> 00:29:36.806
And that really surprise me
because I thought we're going

00:29:36.806 --> 00:29:38.246
to talk about climate
change and--

00:29:38.246 --> 00:29:42.186
or not or just ecological
land preservation.

00:29:42.306 --> 00:29:44.766
But as it turned out,
they're one in the same.

00:29:45.106 --> 00:29:48.066
And so, even though my
background was an environment,

00:29:48.186 --> 00:29:49.976
you can't do environmental work

00:29:50.186 --> 00:29:52.386
without recognizing
the implications

00:29:52.386 --> 00:29:54.846
of the agricultural system.

00:29:54.906 --> 00:29:57.856
Along those lines,
a lot of people

00:29:57.976 --> 00:30:00.916
in Santa Barbara especially,
we have these high hopes

00:30:01.126 --> 00:30:03.346
for where the environmental

00:30:03.346 --> 00:30:05.336
like the well-being
of our environment.

00:30:05.946 --> 00:30:08.476
And at the same time we have so
many people living in poverty

00:30:08.836 --> 00:30:10.966
that how are we going to
even have conversations

00:30:10.966 --> 00:30:12.856
about recycling when
people haven't been fed.

00:30:12.856 --> 00:30:15.476
And so, going back to Kathy's
[assumed spelling] question

00:30:15.476 --> 00:30:18.376
about how do we empower
our community.

00:30:19.416 --> 00:30:21.736
Above the Executive
Directors Office in--

00:30:21.736 --> 00:30:24.226
at the Food Bank there is
three posters and they say,

00:30:24.466 --> 00:30:25.996
"Nourish, Teach and Power".

00:30:26.646 --> 00:30:28.496
But empowerment really
starts with the nourishment

00:30:28.596 --> 00:30:31.716
because if anybody comes to
one of our food distributions,

00:30:31.806 --> 00:30:34.026
they are welcomed with
a smile with dignity

00:30:34.236 --> 00:30:36.036
and the opportunity
for education.

00:30:36.506 --> 00:30:40.426
And that message and feeling is
present in every single person

00:30:40.426 --> 00:30:43.216
at the Food Bank and in every
single one of our program.

00:30:43.706 --> 00:30:48.306
And we want to give as
many resources as possible

00:30:48.646 --> 00:30:50.786
but sometimes people
aren't ready to receive them

00:30:50.786 --> 00:30:52.136
if they're still in
the nourish part.

00:30:52.486 --> 00:30:54.986
And that's a conversation
that is hard sometimes to have

00:30:54.986 --> 00:30:59.146
with foundations or with other
organizations when they're like,

00:30:59.146 --> 00:31:00.726
go and do this, go and do that.

00:31:00.726 --> 00:31:05.416
And it's like, well, they
are still working three jobs

00:31:05.566 --> 00:31:08.136
and so we want them to come to
community meetings if they want

00:31:08.136 --> 00:31:10.696
to and I'm working on that.

00:31:11.306 --> 00:31:14.096
But sometimes we just need
to offer the food first

00:31:14.186 --> 00:31:18.396
and I think empowerment starts

00:31:18.396 --> 00:31:19.576
with building these
relationships

00:31:19.666 --> 00:31:20.916
and understanding
what people are--

00:31:20.916 --> 00:31:22.236
and meeting people
where they're at

00:31:22.426 --> 00:31:24.306
and sometimes is just asking
them how their day was,

00:31:24.306 --> 00:31:25.976
not asking them to
come to a rally.

00:31:28.156 --> 00:31:30.836
&gt;&gt; Thank you all for those
wonderful pearls of wisdom.

00:31:31.326 --> 00:31:33.356
So we'll go ahead to the
questions from the audience.

00:31:33.766 --> 00:31:35.596
The first question
is for [inaudible]

00:31:36.056 --> 00:31:40.226
and this is Oaxaca is the
state where the majority

00:31:40.226 --> 00:31:42.366
of immigrants come
from the California.

00:31:42.936 --> 00:31:45.206
How has this affected the
health of the immigrants,

00:31:45.306 --> 00:31:49.136
their families both born in
Oaxaca and the US in regards

00:31:49.136 --> 00:31:52.426
to the modernization of food?

00:31:52.966 --> 00:31:56.166
Are they less healthy in the US
than they would be in Oaxaca?

00:31:56.936 --> 00:32:00.646
&gt;&gt; I think this is a
good question for me

00:32:00.646 --> 00:32:01.926
and my colleague in general.

00:32:04.266 --> 00:32:07.806
We did a research study in
Oxnard, California that showed

00:32:07.806 --> 00:32:12.046
that a lot of this
community is high in diabetes

00:32:12.046 --> 00:32:16.346
and other cardiovascular
disease due to--

00:32:16.436 --> 00:32:19.146
in Oaxaca there wasn't
really a use for oils

00:32:19.296 --> 00:32:21.236
which is highly used now.

00:32:21.456 --> 00:32:26.456
There's also greater access to
meats, fish, crab, all the meats

00:32:26.456 --> 00:32:30.706
in general whereas there was
only access once in a while.

00:32:30.746 --> 00:32:34.216
We have the money to buy the
meats, so there's a huge change

00:32:34.216 --> 00:32:37.716
in that increase and it's--
we've been able to assess it

00:32:37.716 --> 00:32:39.406
through the house
study basically.

00:32:39.736 --> 00:32:42.166
So there is a huge
change and I think it's

00:32:42.166 --> 00:32:44.156
because there was much
more access to fruits

00:32:44.156 --> 00:32:46.926
and vegetables back
home than there is here.

00:32:46.926 --> 00:32:49.616
And the fruits and vegetables
that are growing here,

00:32:49.716 --> 00:32:52.046
if you want them to be
organic, they're like--

00:32:52.046 --> 00:32:54.486
I don't know, it's
like $2, $3 per--

00:32:55.326 --> 00:32:57.486
$6 for a packing of
blueberries, right,

00:32:57.486 --> 00:33:00.216
that comes in this
little tiny ounces.

00:33:00.216 --> 00:33:01.836
And how much that
the person get paid

00:33:01.836 --> 00:33:03.376
to be able to harvest these?

00:33:03.646 --> 00:33:05.436
You know, I know this because
they're my friends and they work

00:33:05.436 --> 00:33:10.196
and they're not even
able to buy those berry--

00:33:10.196 --> 00:33:13.336
blueberries that they-- that
we consider healthy, you know,

00:33:13.336 --> 00:33:16.216
that are organic in
some way or another.

00:33:16.336 --> 00:33:19.546
So it's directly affecting
their health everyday.

00:33:20.016 --> 00:33:24.076
And then our children are also
being fed an American nice diet

00:33:24.076 --> 00:33:25.056
at school.

00:33:25.056 --> 00:33:27.646
So it's like hamburgers
and pizza and fries--

00:33:27.766 --> 00:33:30.476
French fries and
they're no longer--

00:33:30.476 --> 00:33:33.686
you know, when I was young and I
heard children really love pizza

00:33:33.686 --> 00:33:37.426
and she traditionally
cooks a lot of her meals

00:33:37.426 --> 00:33:41.396
in traditional ways and how
do you balance that out?

00:33:41.396 --> 00:33:43.896
It's like my child is growing
up in this Americanized system

00:33:43.896 --> 00:33:46.766
and like it's cool to go to Jack
in The Box or wherever it is

00:33:46.766 --> 00:33:49.806
that kids want to go to
nowadays and not cool

00:33:49.806 --> 00:33:52.586
to bring your lunch bill at
home with your traditional meal.

00:33:52.726 --> 00:33:56.276
I remember being a
child and not wanting

00:33:56.276 --> 00:33:57.516
to bring my burrito to school.

00:33:57.516 --> 00:33:58.796
I wanted a [inaudible]
and I wanted an apple

00:33:58.796 --> 00:34:01.496
with my little lunch box.

00:34:01.496 --> 00:34:03.676
I want to be a normal
kid, right?

00:34:04.086 --> 00:34:06.886
But no, it was-- so there
is a huge change in diet

00:34:06.886 --> 00:34:09.326
and we can continue to talk
about what that looks like

00:34:09.326 --> 00:34:12.766
and we'll follow the
conversation however that helps.

00:34:13.636 --> 00:34:43.256
[ Foreign Language ]

00:34:43.756 --> 00:34:45.026
&gt;&gt; Sorry, wrong language.

00:34:45.216 --> 00:34:50.016
So, basically as I
mentioned earlier, you know,

00:34:50.046 --> 00:34:54.956
in Oaxaca we have access to
a lot of more organic foods.

00:34:55.036 --> 00:34:58.236
We don't have access
to restaurants

00:34:58.236 --> 00:35:02.336
to fast food restaurants,
so when we come here,

00:35:02.336 --> 00:35:07.666
we also besides that access to
these type of a food, the mother

00:35:07.666 --> 00:35:09.316
and the father have to work.

00:35:09.316 --> 00:35:12.956
And so, you know, while in
Oaxaca only the father works.

00:35:13.146 --> 00:35:15.186
The mother can have
more time to cook.

00:35:16.636 --> 00:35:36.306
[ Foreign Language ]

00:35:36.806 --> 00:35:38.446
So you get here and you see

00:35:38.446 --> 00:35:41.346
that you can actually consume
meat and you see these.

00:35:41.346 --> 00:35:43.596
Oh this is a change
which is great

00:35:43.596 --> 00:35:46.096
but at the same time
it's not good.

00:35:46.636 --> 00:35:56.216
[ Foreign Language ]

00:35:56.716 --> 00:35:59.196
So because here it
is cheaper, you know,

00:35:59.196 --> 00:36:01.596
you can get to hamburger
for $2 but a bag

00:36:01.906 --> 00:36:04.016
of vegetable is more expensive.

00:36:04.636 --> 00:36:20.486
[ Foreign Language ]

00:36:20.986 --> 00:36:24.466
So, you know, also our working
schedule we work 10 hour,

00:36:24.526 --> 00:36:26.876
12 hour days and so
we don't have time

00:36:26.876 --> 00:36:28.266
to cook, so what do you do?

00:36:28.656 --> 00:36:32.106
You drop by and buy $5
pizza on your way home

00:36:32.266 --> 00:36:33.766
and that's what happens.

00:36:35.736 --> 00:36:36.166
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:36:36.726 --> 00:36:40.416
The next question is what
questions do you think need

00:36:40.416 --> 00:36:44.116
to be ask to assess the
needs of university students

00:36:44.116 --> 00:36:48.236
and local communities in regards
to food and food justice?

00:36:48.236 --> 00:36:49.506
And that could go
to any panelists.

00:36:53.456 --> 00:36:57.756
&gt;&gt; I feel like people
are looking at me.

00:36:58.636 --> 00:37:00.956
[ Laughter ]

00:37:01.456 --> 00:37:03.916
No, no. I'm totally not.

00:37:04.106 --> 00:37:05.346
Like I said, I'm
totally new to this,

00:37:05.346 --> 00:37:07.036
so definitely [inaudible]
his at on.

00:37:08.636 --> 00:37:12.836
I think we just haven't even
asked the most basic questions,

00:37:12.836 --> 00:37:12.986
right?

00:37:12.986 --> 00:37:15.766
Like, you know, I think we
need to assess the demographic,

00:37:16.016 --> 00:37:17.676
so what family you come from,

00:37:17.676 --> 00:37:20.106
what your financial
bracket is roughly

00:37:20.106 --> 00:37:22.136
so we can understand what
the demographic looks like.

00:37:22.606 --> 00:37:25.306
But also we need to ask like
how much do you budget for food

00:37:25.306 --> 00:37:27.886
or do you budget the food,
like have you taken, you know,

00:37:27.886 --> 00:37:31.286
any kind of classes that
will help you budget.

00:37:31.286 --> 00:37:33.276
Do you know how to read
the nutritional label,

00:37:33.276 --> 00:37:34.936
like do you know where to go?

00:37:34.936 --> 00:37:37.396
Do you know basic
things like, you know,

00:37:37.396 --> 00:37:39.956
fun facts like if you
qualify for work study,

00:37:39.956 --> 00:37:41.706
you also qualify for CalFresh.

00:37:42.296 --> 00:37:44.846
People don't know these kinds
of things and so I think we need

00:37:44.846 --> 00:37:47.326
to do a demographic
understanding

00:37:47.326 --> 00:37:50.466
of who are our population is.

00:37:50.926 --> 00:37:53.846
But also we need to ask
whether they know of a lot

00:37:53.846 --> 00:37:57.236
of these resources are even
available and how as providers

00:37:57.236 --> 00:38:00.356
or as advocates so we can do
a better job in advocating

00:38:00.356 --> 00:38:01.586
for their need like
I think we need

00:38:01.586 --> 00:38:04.936
to ask them what they need
first before we could kind

00:38:04.936 --> 00:38:06.936
of practice strategy
on how do we address it

00:38:06.936 --> 00:38:08.216
and that's also part
of the work.

00:38:08.506 --> 00:38:10.636
The students are doing now
is trying to understand

00:38:10.666 --> 00:38:12.886
like what did this--
what does it need to look

00:38:12.886 --> 00:38:15.766
like for students so that we
can better develop our response.

00:38:17.566 --> 00:38:19.986
&gt;&gt; Next question is what--
oh, [inaudible] first?

00:38:20.166 --> 00:38:20.336
OK.

00:38:20.466 --> 00:38:25.686
&gt;&gt; I just wanted to add, I
think it would also be important

00:38:25.686 --> 00:38:27.256
to ask students what
are the values

00:38:27.256 --> 00:38:30.816
that you want your
future reflect, right?

00:38:30.816 --> 00:38:32.986
Do you want food that
is produced by workers

00:38:32.986 --> 00:38:35.376
who are paid fairly a living
wage, do you want food

00:38:35.696 --> 00:38:38.266
that is produced in
environmentally sustainable way,

00:38:38.326 --> 00:38:39.686
food that is local or--

00:38:40.766 --> 00:38:42.086
all those different
issues that we're tracking.

00:38:42.256 --> 00:38:42.356
&gt;&gt; OK.

00:38:44.616 --> 00:38:46.606
&gt;&gt; The next question is what US,

00:38:46.646 --> 00:38:49.866
or California State policies
need to change in order

00:38:49.866 --> 00:38:52.686
to support your goals for
the food system reform.

00:38:54.506 --> 00:38:57.826
Dartanian, do you want to start?

00:38:57.826 --> 00:38:58.476
&gt;&gt; Sure yeah.

00:38:58.476 --> 00:39:01.166
So, you know, both
you and I serve

00:39:01.166 --> 00:39:03.926
on the Los Angeles Food Policy
Council and I also serve

00:39:03.926 --> 00:39:06.226
on the California
Food Policy Council

00:39:06.226 --> 00:39:08.666
where there has been
this amazing movement

00:39:08.736 --> 00:39:10.666
of youth leaders and
community leaders

00:39:10.666 --> 00:39:14.036
who are advocating
very diligently

00:39:14.036 --> 00:39:15.836
for change in our food system.

00:39:16.176 --> 00:39:20.066
California-- I think is leading
the way in this disregard.

00:39:21.296 --> 00:39:23.716
There were things that need
to happen in our communities,

00:39:23.716 --> 00:39:27.536
for example, folk need to
ensure that rather we need

00:39:27.536 --> 00:39:29.236
to have policies that
assure people have the right

00:39:29.236 --> 00:39:30.416
to grow their own food.

00:39:30.656 --> 00:39:32.636
You know, depending on where
you live it might not be illegal

00:39:32.636 --> 00:39:35.636
actually for you to grow
food in your own home

00:39:36.176 --> 00:39:37.316
or in your own backyard.

00:39:37.546 --> 00:39:40.546
Now fortunately we
worked on AB2561 last year

00:39:41.096 --> 00:39:44.386
which made it legal for tenants,
who live in single family homes

00:39:44.386 --> 00:39:47.086
or in duplexes or at a
homeowners association

00:39:47.086 --> 00:39:49.316
to grow food either on
a portable container

00:39:49.536 --> 00:39:50.876
or in a small part of land.

00:39:51.286 --> 00:39:52.936
Your landlord can't
stop you from doing that

00:39:52.936 --> 00:39:55.336
but they can certainly tell
you where to put it, right?

00:39:55.556 --> 00:39:57.106
But just think about
that for a second.

00:39:57.106 --> 00:40:01.286
We're talking about food
sovereignty and sustainability

00:40:01.286 --> 00:40:03.356
and the ability to care for your
family, to care for the land

00:40:03.356 --> 00:40:05.426
and you don't even have
the right to grow food

00:40:05.426 --> 00:40:08.266
in your own home,
that's a problem, right?

00:40:08.556 --> 00:40:11.716
So I think it first starts with
acknowledging our sovereignty

00:40:11.716 --> 00:40:15.266
and acknowledging the need
that we have to feed ourselves

00:40:15.446 --> 00:40:17.526
so that we know our food
comes from, we can begin

00:40:17.526 --> 00:40:20.506
to build connections again to
that food and then advocate

00:40:20.506 --> 00:40:23.926
for the care of the land and
the people who are also growing

00:40:23.926 --> 00:40:26.096
that food, so that's one
area that needs to change.

00:40:26.446 --> 00:40:28.446
I think there are many
others that need to change.

00:40:29.396 --> 00:40:32.346
Mainly what we-- how we
treat our farm workers

00:40:32.346 --> 00:40:34.576
and the wages we pay people.

00:40:34.576 --> 00:40:36.996
I mean, you know, I've
been saying this before,

00:40:36.996 --> 00:40:39.406
I've said this recently and
I'll just say this again.

00:40:39.706 --> 00:40:42.546
Much of what we're talking
about boils down to the economy

00:40:42.546 --> 00:40:44.906
and economic and
equities that exist.

00:40:44.906 --> 00:40:47.856
And so if we do things
like allow for record--

00:40:47.856 --> 00:40:51.066
corporate profits to exist, but
then we also depression wages,

00:40:51.066 --> 00:40:53.716
people are not going to be
able to care for themselves,

00:40:53.716 --> 00:40:55.966
they're not going to be able to
purchase the food that they need

00:40:55.966 --> 00:40:59.606
in order to eat healthy
and live healthy lives.

00:40:59.916 --> 00:41:04.816
So we have to do things both in
our sort of food system as well

00:41:04.816 --> 00:41:08.096
but we got to appreciate the
economic disparities that exist

00:41:08.226 --> 00:41:12.026
which contribute to
these gaps that continue

00:41:12.026 --> 00:41:14.536
to exacerbate diet
related diseases as well.

00:41:14.586 --> 00:41:17.026
&gt;&gt; I'm sorry.

00:41:17.386 --> 00:41:19.386
[ Laughter ]

00:41:19.636 --> 00:41:22.996
&gt;&gt; I super ask one of the main
policies that we have to hit

00:41:22.996 --> 00:41:25.266
for is raising the
minimum wage, you know,

00:41:25.626 --> 00:41:28.326
so I think Dart spoke
very eloquently

00:41:28.326 --> 00:41:30.216
about the needs with that.

00:41:30.696 --> 00:41:32.956
And for those of you
at UCLA you might know

00:41:32.956 --> 00:41:35.016
that in Los Angeles now
there's the movement

00:41:35.016 --> 00:41:38.106
to raise the minimum wage
there, I feel like LA is--

00:41:38.106 --> 00:41:41.506
there's been study coming out.

00:41:41.506 --> 00:41:45.376
Just yesterday I saw for
the typical [inaudible]

00:41:45.376 --> 00:41:47.986
to actually afford
rent, they would need

00:41:47.986 --> 00:41:50.626
to be paid $33 per hour.

00:41:51.206 --> 00:41:54.846
And there's more people
living in apartment even in LA

00:41:54.846 --> 00:41:57.426
than anywhere else
but you saw, you know,

00:41:57.426 --> 00:42:00.286
just following the state minimum
wage we're just currently is $9

00:42:00.376 --> 00:42:00.746
per hour.

00:42:00.866 --> 00:42:06.506
So, yeah, so that's a very
important issue and we're also,

00:42:06.696 --> 00:42:09.516
you know, we think they're
severe universal healthcare

00:42:10.666 --> 00:42:13.096
for everyone, right, that
healthcare is the right

00:42:13.096 --> 00:42:15.586
and that impacts
everyone's health

00:42:15.966 --> 00:42:18.066
and the abilities will
also take care of itself.

00:42:18.066 --> 00:42:22.476
So those are-- And the last
thing to add that, you know,

00:42:22.476 --> 00:42:25.166
like farm workers aren't
outside of California

00:42:25.166 --> 00:42:28.596
and Washington State actually
aren't covered by laws

00:42:28.816 --> 00:42:30.946
that allow them the
right to organize

00:42:31.086 --> 00:42:32.656
and to take collective action.

00:42:33.086 --> 00:42:34.576
And even worker who
are protected

00:42:34.576 --> 00:42:38.016
by that law it's very easy
for in court to fire them to,

00:42:38.016 --> 00:42:41.076
you know, threaten them
and discipline them.

00:42:41.416 --> 00:42:43.716
And so we think those
laws need to change too

00:42:43.716 --> 00:42:46.716
to better protect workers and
insure all workers are protected

00:42:46.716 --> 00:42:48.576
by that right to take
collective action

00:42:48.576 --> 00:42:51.276
because that's really what's
going to build their, you know,

00:42:51.566 --> 00:42:53.916
build democratic
workplaces in communities.

00:42:54.486 --> 00:42:54.966
&gt;&gt; Wonderful.

00:42:56.136 --> 00:42:57.846
[ Inaudible Remark ]

00:42:57.846 --> 00:43:00.946
&gt;&gt; So earlier this year there
was an article published

00:43:00.996 --> 00:43:04.156
by Mark Bittman and Ricardo
Salvado and I really wish

00:43:04.156 --> 00:43:04.646
that Niki [assumed spelling]

00:43:04.646 --> 00:43:06.956
from this morning would have
been an author on that paper

00:43:06.956 --> 00:43:10.816
because we need more voices
on it especially women, but.

00:43:11.236 --> 00:43:13.246
It was a call for
a national reform

00:43:13.346 --> 00:43:14.876
to food policy in the farm bill.

00:43:14.966 --> 00:43:18.016
And when you have a
farm bill that advocates

00:43:18.016 --> 00:43:23.846
for a sick society like in
terms of wellness then help--

00:43:24.456 --> 00:43:29.766
you can't have a healthy one, so
seeing these men come together

00:43:29.766 --> 00:43:34.566
and ask the government and
just put it there, you know,

00:43:34.566 --> 00:43:36.946
for the whole news media to say,

00:43:36.946 --> 00:43:38.046
yes this is what
we're going for.

00:43:38.046 --> 00:43:38.806
This is what we need.

00:43:39.086 --> 00:43:40.366
These are the changes
that need to happen

00:43:40.956 --> 00:43:43.976
and I applauded them
for doing that.

00:43:44.316 --> 00:43:46.656
&gt;&gt; The next question
is as a child

00:43:46.656 --> 00:43:49.956
of the Oaxacan immigrants
what advice would you give me

00:43:50.186 --> 00:43:53.066
as to how to teach my
parents about sustainability

00:43:53.336 --> 00:44:01.086
and that their ways in Oaxaca
are better than those here?

00:44:01.636 --> 00:44:26.766
[ Foreign Language ]

00:44:27.266 --> 00:44:31.296
&gt;&gt; So, basically what I'm doing
is trying to teach my daughters

00:44:31.296 --> 00:44:35.156
about what I, you know, my life
and like during my childhood

00:44:35.156 --> 00:44:36.896
in Oaxaca, how we ate,

00:44:36.896 --> 00:44:40.256
how we actually ate directly
what we kind of State.

00:44:40.256 --> 00:44:44.986
So for example I try to make a
salsa with tomatoes and chili

00:44:44.986 --> 00:44:48.046
and maybe with an egg
that doesn't have fat.

00:44:49.636 --> 00:45:11.766
[ Foreign Language ]

00:45:12.266 --> 00:45:15.876
So as I mentioned before
in my work as a volunteer

00:45:15.876 --> 00:45:18.506
at a community garden, I
teach them how to plant,

00:45:18.736 --> 00:45:23.246
how to harvest and how you
can actually grow vegetables

00:45:23.306 --> 00:45:24.346
without pesticides.

00:45:26.636 --> 00:45:47.426
[ Foreign Language ]

00:45:47.926 --> 00:45:50.386
So that's what I do as
part of my education.

00:45:50.386 --> 00:45:53.556
I try them to-- get them
to eat more vegetables

00:45:53.556 --> 00:45:56.016
and we all know children don't
like vegetables, you know,

00:45:56.016 --> 00:45:59.256
but I try to make it a
point that we eat healthy.

00:46:01.876 --> 00:46:05.676
&gt;&gt; Our next question is an
ongoing stigma with students

00:46:05.676 --> 00:46:08.036
about being homeless,
couch-surfing,

00:46:08.336 --> 00:46:10.686
receiving food stamps, and more.

00:46:11.216 --> 00:46:13.216
What can be done to
reduce this stigma?

00:46:13.216 --> 00:46:18.676
&gt;&gt; I think I can say
something about that.

00:46:18.676 --> 00:46:21.346
So one of the things that the
Food Bank has done is we have

00:46:21.436 --> 00:46:23.546
started to do food
distributions in the form

00:46:23.546 --> 00:46:26.116
of healthy school pantries
which are like health fares.

00:46:26.576 --> 00:46:29.706
And when someone arrives,
they go through this corridor

00:46:29.706 --> 00:46:36.106
of services and it's welcoming
and it's generally services

00:46:36.106 --> 00:46:37.216
that are needed by families.

00:46:37.566 --> 00:46:39.596
But we talked with Hancock
[assumed spelling] recently

00:46:39.646 --> 00:46:41.716
to see if that was a
model that would apply

00:46:41.716 --> 00:46:43.166
to college level campus.

00:46:43.166 --> 00:46:46.586
Different services, but
still more focused on health.

00:46:46.586 --> 00:46:48.736
And as part of that,
they would receive food.

00:46:49.446 --> 00:46:51.746
There would be some element
of food distribution,

00:46:51.996 --> 00:46:54.926
but it wasn't just
that, that we're focused

00:46:54.926 --> 00:46:55.906
on health and wellness.

00:46:58.136 --> 00:46:59.216
[ Inaudible Remark ]

00:46:59.216 --> 00:47:03.226
&gt;&gt; Yeah, you know, I happen
to be one of those students

00:47:03.476 --> 00:47:06.336
at the time when I
started undergrad at UCLA.

00:47:06.776 --> 00:47:08.826
Coming from Los Angles
or South LA,

00:47:08.826 --> 00:47:11.676
I didn't have access
to resources, right?

00:47:11.676 --> 00:47:13.486
And I have a family
member I could pick

00:47:13.486 --> 00:47:14.836
on the phone and call them.

00:47:15.196 --> 00:47:17.346
In fact, because I was receiving
financially they would often

00:47:17.346 --> 00:47:19.076
call me and say, "Hey
can you help us out?

00:47:19.076 --> 00:47:20.716
We don't have anything to eat."

00:47:20.716 --> 00:47:22.596
And so having been
in that situation,

00:47:22.596 --> 00:47:24.136
I understand how
difficult it was.

00:47:24.636 --> 00:47:27.606
I would work 30 to 40 hours
a week get in and out, right?

00:47:27.936 --> 00:47:30.086
Sometimes that would be
my only meal for the day.

00:47:30.306 --> 00:47:33.486
So I know how challenging
it can be as a student to go

00:47:33.486 --> 00:47:37.406
through that and I think one of
the strategies that I was able

00:47:37.406 --> 00:47:40.446
to utilize to both to get
support that I needed,

00:47:40.446 --> 00:47:42.726
but to also be OK with that was

00:47:42.726 --> 00:47:45.186
to approach my councilors,
right?

00:47:45.506 --> 00:47:48.766
I had this amazing
councilor, two actually,

00:47:49.106 --> 00:47:53.026
one was named Shelley Benton
and our academic supports

00:47:53.026 --> 00:47:55.806
or academic services in the
College of Letters and Science

00:47:55.806 --> 00:47:58.056
at UCLA who took the
time to get to know me,

00:47:58.056 --> 00:48:00.716
to get to know my needs, and to
understand what those needs were

00:48:00.966 --> 00:48:02.456
and provided advice
and direction.

00:48:02.796 --> 00:48:04.596
The other person was
my [inaudible] mentors

00:48:05.566 --> 00:48:07.026
in the academic advancement
program

00:48:07.026 --> 00:48:08.526
at UCLA who did the same.

00:48:08.826 --> 00:48:10.436
So it's by building
relationships

00:48:10.436 --> 00:48:13.536
with these ombudsmen, so
to speak, these people

00:48:13.536 --> 00:48:16.066
on our campuses who
interact direct with students

00:48:16.066 --> 00:48:18.616
and letting me know about the
resources that were available

00:48:18.826 --> 00:48:20.596
and I was able to get
the support I needed.

00:48:20.596 --> 00:48:25.516
And I think, in many ways the--
it starts with and I think most

00:48:25.516 --> 00:48:27.456
of the panelist here would
probably agree but it starts

00:48:27.456 --> 00:48:28.716
and ends with relationships.

00:48:28.936 --> 00:48:32.096
If you don't have relationships
with students in the institution

00:48:32.386 --> 00:48:34.476
or you don't have relationship
with people in the community

00:48:34.656 --> 00:48:36.406
or you're not able to
build solid relationships

00:48:36.406 --> 00:48:36.996
with each other.

00:48:36.996 --> 00:48:38.836
You're not going to
get good work done.

00:48:39.586 --> 00:48:41.626
And so I think it's
beginning to focus on--

00:48:41.626 --> 00:48:42.706
so we want to get
through stigma,

00:48:42.706 --> 00:48:45.486
you got to start building
relationships with those who are

00:48:45.486 --> 00:48:48.406
in need, but having the
mechanisms to do that

00:48:48.406 --> 00:48:51.376
and be able to scale up the
systems that are discovered

00:48:51.376 --> 00:48:53.236
through those processes.

00:48:53.746 --> 00:48:56.516
&gt;&gt; Our next question
will be in Spanish.

00:48:56.516 --> 00:49:00.306

read that one for us.

00:49:33.516 --> 00:49:37.526

interpret the question

00:49:37.526 --> 00:49:38.106
into English and
[foreign language].

00:49:38.106 --> 00:49:42.926
How has modernizationing
[phonetic] Oaxaca affected the

00:49:42.926 --> 00:49:46.126
indigenous communities,
not only in the harvesting,

00:49:46.126 --> 00:49:49.386
but also in natural
remedies for midwives?

00:49:50.216 --> 00:49:54.786
Do you think that natural
remedies are being lost?

00:49:54.786 --> 00:49:59.896
And also, how does food in
Oaxaca help not only children

00:49:59.896 --> 00:50:04.426
and youth, but all the people?

00:50:05.636 --> 00:50:33.666

00:50:34.166 --> 00:50:39.066
So, you know-- Can you hear me?

00:50:39.066 --> 00:50:43.406
OK. So, when we get here, we--

00:50:43.406 --> 00:50:45.196
the changes are not
only in food,

00:50:45.196 --> 00:50:47.316
but also for example
in home remedies.

00:50:47.436 --> 00:50:50.796
So it's important to try to
keep those whole remedies,

00:50:50.796 --> 00:50:53.376
to try to get the
ingredients, but also to learn

00:50:53.376 --> 00:50:57.046
about the local remedies
like Tylenol.

00:50:57.636 --> 00:51:17.626

00:51:18.126 --> 00:51:23.856
So, one thing that we do in our
centers to educate the parents

00:51:23.856 --> 00:51:28.186
about healthcare and well-being
and so we tell them sometimes

00:51:28.186 --> 00:51:32.206
that there could be some
danger in some home remedies

00:51:32.296 --> 00:51:34.746
and to be careful what they
give to their children.

00:51:35.636 --> 00:51:56.276
[ Foreign Language ]

00:51:56.776 --> 00:52:01.216
So, we also try to
teach them that it's OK

00:52:01.216 --> 00:52:04.376
to use these home remedies,
but also to take their children

00:52:04.376 --> 00:52:06.396
to the doctor to make sure

00:52:06.396 --> 00:52:11.096
that our care doesn't affect
the heath of our children.

00:52:11.636 --> 00:52:33.706
[ Foreign Language ]

00:52:34.206 --> 00:52:36.696
So we try to teach them,

00:52:36.696 --> 00:52:39.086
but also the ultimate
decision is on the parents.

00:52:39.266 --> 00:52:41.436
Am I going to give
them a kamomile tea

00:52:41.436 --> 00:52:43.136
or am I going to
give them a syrup.

00:52:44.136 --> 00:52:49.136
So it's up to each
family at a point.

00:52:49.386 --> 00:52:50.386
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:52:50.386 --> 00:52:55.536
The next question is how come
a hamburger and fries cost less

00:52:55.706 --> 00:52:56.996
than a head of broccoli?

00:52:59.736 --> 00:53:01.606
&gt;&gt; How can a what?

00:53:02.116 --> 00:53:04.416
&gt;&gt; When-- Sorry, I'm going
to repeat that question.

00:53:04.596 --> 00:53:07.086
How come a hamburger
and fries cost less

00:53:07.336 --> 00:53:08.606
than a head of broccoli?

00:53:08.976 --> 00:53:09.296
Melissa?

00:53:09.546 --> 00:53:14.046
&gt;&gt; Sure. I'll do
my best with this.

00:53:14.046 --> 00:53:17.916
So, the farm bill
fund subsidizes food

00:53:18.136 --> 00:53:19.096
that makes that possible.

00:53:19.096 --> 00:53:20.206
That is the shortest answer.

00:53:20.536 --> 00:53:23.926
And so when Kathy asked,
what are the policy that need

00:53:23.926 --> 00:53:26.076
to change, and I
say all of them.

00:53:26.076 --> 00:53:30.006
It's because how are we
funding corn syrup, hamburgers,

00:53:30.006 --> 00:53:31.696
French fries, the oil that
goes into French fries,

00:53:31.696 --> 00:53:34.566
all of those things and then
an organic farmer can't get

00:53:34.566 --> 00:53:35.306
a subsidy.

00:53:35.306 --> 00:53:41.236
and it comes from those
federal policies and a lot

00:53:41.236 --> 00:53:42.066
of people aren't voting.

00:53:42.166 --> 00:53:44.086
Let me speak about
that just for a second.

00:53:44.226 --> 00:53:46.356
So I don't know if all of you
voted in the last selection

00:53:46.356 --> 00:53:49.606
or in the midterm selections,
but if you didn't and you can,

00:53:49.796 --> 00:53:52.476
please do and please
vote for the policies

00:53:52.476 --> 00:53:53.616
that will change that.

00:53:55.786 --> 00:53:59.326
&gt;&gt; The next question, also
on the international policy,

00:53:59.726 --> 00:54:04.666
is NAFTA is an example of a
financial incentive to divest

00:54:04.666 --> 00:54:06.326
of local food independence.

00:54:06.656 --> 00:54:09.336
Similar financial trends
are well established

00:54:09.336 --> 00:54:12.926
in the first world countries
and in university food systems.

00:54:13.176 --> 00:54:16.336
Are there financial
incentives or economic models

00:54:16.766 --> 00:54:19.986
that could work the other
way other than patches

00:54:19.986 --> 00:54:21.546
such as charitable
food handouts?

00:54:21.546 --> 00:54:28.876
&gt;&gt; You know, I think it's
the million dollar question.

00:54:28.876 --> 00:54:31.346
Really, what I hear in that
question is what can we do

00:54:31.346 --> 00:54:34.886
to shift our local foods-- ship
to a local food system, right?

00:54:34.886 --> 00:54:36.946
I mean, that's fundamentally
what it's about.

00:54:36.946 --> 00:54:39.186
And often what you will
find since I grow food

00:54:39.186 --> 00:54:41.626
in the community and we have a
community supportive agriculture

00:54:41.966 --> 00:54:44.916
program, we have been wrestling
with this for quite sometime.

00:54:45.386 --> 00:54:48.906
What I find is that institutions
like UC Santa Barbara, UCLA,

00:54:48.906 --> 00:54:50.106
UC Berkeley, et cetera.

00:54:50.646 --> 00:54:54.996
LAUSD, et cetera, they all
have issues with scale, right?

00:54:55.296 --> 00:54:59.456
So to feed 750,000 students
in LAUSD, you have to be able

00:54:59.456 --> 00:55:02.586
to source in that food each
day to do that and it has to be

00:55:02.586 --> 00:55:05.466
at such a cost that allows
you to meet the needs

00:55:05.466 --> 00:55:07.356
of all those students,
same thing here

00:55:07.356 --> 00:55:08.566
at these institutions.

00:55:08.986 --> 00:55:11.796
And so in Los Angeles, the LA
Food Policy Councilor proposed

00:55:11.796 --> 00:55:13.616
and they called the Good
Food Purchasing Pledge

00:55:14.056 --> 00:55:18.086
which commits these institutions
to purchasing from local growers

00:55:18.086 --> 00:55:22.716
and local owners and
sourcing their food as much

00:55:22.716 --> 00:55:25.186
as possible from our own region.

00:55:25.186 --> 00:55:28.126
And I think those types of
activities have to occur

00:55:28.266 --> 00:55:32.176
if we're going to shift
from these larger sort

00:55:32.176 --> 00:55:35.216
of sociopolitical systems
that are destroying

00:55:35.216 --> 00:55:36.816
in many ways our food system.

00:55:36.816 --> 00:55:39.486
And yes I agree that we are--
we are incentivized to purchase

00:55:39.486 --> 00:55:40.746
from other countries
and whatnot.

00:55:41.126 --> 00:55:42.986
And we also have to
appreciate what that does

00:55:43.156 --> 00:55:44.516
and how it also helps to lift.

00:55:44.516 --> 00:55:46.026
It can contribute too,

00:55:46.026 --> 00:55:47.706
but it can also lift
people out of poverty.

00:55:47.956 --> 00:55:50.146
So I think it's about sort
of taking a step back,

00:55:50.146 --> 00:55:52.966
looking at the systems approach
or taking a systems approach

00:55:52.966 --> 00:55:56.576
to understanding scale and then
figuring out how we're going

00:55:56.576 --> 00:56:00.836
to re-localize our food
systems if we're actually going

00:56:00.836 --> 00:56:03.026
to achieve equity and
close those disparities.

00:56:03.026 --> 00:56:04.506
&gt;&gt; Just to add.

00:56:04.706 --> 00:56:07.476
I think most of you
probably or know

00:56:07.476 --> 00:56:09.866
about the Real Food Challenge
that the [inaudible],

00:56:09.866 --> 00:56:14.686
but I know there's
workshops going on

00:56:14.686 --> 00:56:19.846
and so it's been an effort
by students in the UCs

00:56:20.066 --> 00:56:22.316
to shift the food purchase
of the UC system, right,

00:56:22.546 --> 00:56:25.466
so that's another example.

00:56:25.646 --> 00:56:28.636
And-- Well, you know, I've
worked closely on this--

00:56:28.636 --> 00:56:32.106
the Good Food Purchasing
Pledge in LA and wanting

00:56:32.176 --> 00:56:34.476
to support a more local food
system it also have to be,

00:56:34.476 --> 00:56:35.056
you know, I mean it's--

00:56:35.636 --> 00:56:39.306
the reality is it is a global
food system and I, you know,

00:56:39.306 --> 00:56:40.866
I personally don't want
to give up chocolate,

00:56:40.866 --> 00:56:41.926
I'm sure people don't
want to give

00:56:41.926 --> 00:56:43.226
up their coffee and tea, right?

00:56:43.226 --> 00:56:45.186
So there's still going to be
some food that we're going

00:56:45.186 --> 00:56:48.506
to have to trade for from
other countries and we need

00:56:48.506 --> 00:56:51.936
to make sure that that trade
is fair for those farmers

00:56:51.936 --> 00:56:54.676
and farm workers
and other producers

00:56:54.676 --> 00:56:56.696
in the other countries.

00:56:56.976 --> 00:56:59.136
&gt;&gt; Well, a huge thank
you to our panelist.

00:56:59.136 --> 00:57:00.076
I know I've learned
so much today.
