00:00:06.737 --> 00:00:09.089
Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.

00:00:09.089 --> 00:00:14.907
Let us welcome you to the final day of
dramatic battle between great tragedians.

00:00:14.907 --> 00:00:17.248
It is a spring day here in Ancient Greece.

00:00:17.248 --> 00:00:22.094
Nearly 17,000 patrons are filing
into the Theatre of Dionysus

00:00:22.094 --> 00:00:23.521
to watch top playwrights,

00:00:23.521 --> 00:00:27.760
including favorites Aeschylus
and Sophocles duke it out

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:31.439
to see whose hero 
may be deemed most tragic,

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:34.300
whose story most awful.

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:35.445
Well Seacrestopolis,

00:00:35.445 --> 00:00:37.311
in last week's battle of the choruses,

00:00:37.311 --> 00:00:41.811
all 50 members of each playwright's chorus
traveled back and forth across the stage,

00:00:41.811 --> 00:00:46.050
singing the strophe and antistrophe,
telling misbegotten tales of woe.

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:48.616
Today's first chorus is entering 
through the parados,

00:00:48.616 --> 00:00:51.982
taking their positions in the orchestra
at the bottom of the stage.

00:00:51.982 --> 00:00:55.488
Mario Lopedokia, this is nothing
we haven't seen before.

00:00:55.488 --> 00:00:59.690
All 50 members speaking
from the depths of their souls.

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:01.585
Wait, what is this?

00:01:01.585 --> 00:01:03.906
I've not seen this before, Seacrestopolis.

00:01:03.906 --> 00:01:07.788
There is one actor stepping out
of choral formation,

00:01:07.788 --> 00:01:10.928
assuming an independent role in this play.

00:01:10.928 --> 00:01:12.531
Can you make out who it is?

00:01:12.531 --> 00:01:14.106
That looks like Thespis.

00:01:14.106 --> 00:01:15.708
It seems he's changing his mask,

00:01:15.708 --> 00:01:17.959
and taking on the role 
of another character.

00:01:17.959 --> 00:01:24.963
Incredible. Surely, Thespis will go down
in history as the very first actor.

00:01:24.963 --> 00:01:28.823
He has changed 
the face of theater forever.

00:01:28.823 --> 00:01:30.999
And that was just the warm-up act.

00:01:30.999 --> 00:01:32.960
On to the main attraction.

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:35.437
Aeschylus will have the stage first.

00:01:35.437 --> 00:01:37.003
Let's see what he does.

00:01:37.003 --> 00:01:38.682
We expect great things.

00:01:38.682 --> 00:01:41.366
Last competition, 
Sophocles beat him by a smidge,

00:01:41.366 --> 00:01:44.358
but Aeschylus is still considered
the Father of Tragedy.

00:01:44.358 --> 00:01:47.765
Now, Aeschylus frequently competes
at this festival, the city Dionysia.

00:01:47.765 --> 00:01:49.459
Though his plays are violent,

00:01:49.459 --> 00:01:52.058
the bloodshed is never 
seen by the audience,

00:01:52.058 --> 00:01:55.077
which allows the dramatic tension
to take center stage.

00:01:55.077 --> 00:01:57.873
Let's see what he does today
to try to win his title back.

00:01:57.873 --> 00:01:59.829
Here comes Aeschylus's chorus,

00:01:59.829 --> 00:02:02.814
but they seem to be missing 
quite a few people.

00:02:02.814 --> 00:02:04.616
What is going on here?

00:02:04.616 --> 00:02:07.155
Not only are they down a few people.

00:02:07.155 --> 00:02:11.006
There are two actors taking center stage.

00:02:11.006 --> 00:02:14.153
This is absolutely unheard of.

00:02:14.153 --> 00:02:19.939
He has build on Thespis's idea
and added a second actor to the mix.

00:02:19.939 --> 00:02:25.023
Aeschylus is relying on 
the two individuals to tell the story.

00:02:25.023 --> 00:02:30.179
The dialogue possible in tragedy
now has taken precedence over the chorus.

00:02:30.179 --> 00:02:32.754
No wonder he drastically shrunk its size.

00:02:32.754 --> 00:02:35.521
This applause is well deserved.

00:02:35.521 --> 00:02:37.216
The crowd has hushed.

00:02:37.216 --> 00:02:39.088
Sophocles's actors and chorus

00:02:39.088 --> 00:02:42.732
are taking the stage for the play,
"Oedipus Rex."

00:02:42.732 --> 00:02:46.494
As usual, the chorus 
is set up in the orchestra.

00:02:46.494 --> 00:02:48.767
And what's this?

00:02:48.767 --> 00:02:52.242
Sophocles has added a third actor.

00:02:52.242 --> 00:02:54.679
Will this one-upmanship never end?

00:02:54.679 --> 00:02:56.093
Three actors,

00:02:56.093 --> 00:03:00.206
and they are changing their masks
to take on several different roles

00:03:00.206 --> 00:03:03.096
as they weave the tale of Oedipus,

00:03:03.096 --> 00:03:06.891
a nice fellow who kills his father
and marries his mother.

00:03:06.891 --> 00:03:10.047
Kills his father and marries his mother.

00:03:10.047 --> 00:03:11.998
That sounds pretty tragic to me.

00:03:11.998 --> 00:03:14.725
It is most tragic, Mario Lopedokia.

00:03:14.725 --> 00:03:18.009
Call me crazy, but I'm willing to bet
that future generations

00:03:18.009 --> 00:03:22.661
will hold this play up 
as the perfect example of tragedy.

00:03:22.661 --> 00:03:24.001
Excuse me, Seacrestopolis.

00:03:24.001 --> 00:03:29.792
Oedipus has left the stage after realizing
Jocasta was his wife and also his mother.

00:03:29.792 --> 00:03:31.592
Where has he gone?

00:03:31.592 --> 00:03:33.576
I can't even imagine.

00:03:33.576 --> 00:03:36.786
Wait. The messenger has stepped on stage

00:03:36.786 --> 00:03:39.789
and is telling us 
of the great king's actions.

00:03:39.789 --> 00:03:44.754
He says that Oedipus, upon finding
his mother, wife, whatever, Jocasta,

00:03:44.754 --> 00:03:47.550
dead of her own hand 
in their incestuous bedroom,

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:51.512
took the broaches from her dress
and stabbed his eyes repeatedly.

00:03:51.512 --> 00:03:53.307
You can't blame the guy, can you?

00:03:53.307 --> 00:03:58.393
Bedded his mother, killed his father,
is father and brother to his children.

00:03:58.393 --> 00:04:00.045
I might do the same.

00:04:00.045 --> 00:04:02.711
My friend, I do believe we've seen it all.

00:04:02.711 --> 00:04:04.034
Indeed, we have.

00:04:04.034 --> 00:04:07.184
There is nothing more tragic than Oedipus.

00:04:07.184 --> 00:04:11.488
And sure enough, the judges who have
been chosen by lot from all over Greece

00:04:11.488 --> 00:04:14.161
are ready to announce the winner.

00:04:14.161 --> 00:04:17.240
Oh, folks! This is one 
for the history books.

00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:21.450
Dark horse playwright, Philocles,
has taken first prize.

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:24.991
What an upset. What a tragedy.

00:04:24.991 --> 00:04:26.647
What a night, folks.

00:04:26.647 --> 00:04:29.856
We have witnessed the laying
of the foundation of modern theater

00:04:29.856 --> 00:04:32.039
and some great innovations:

00:04:32.039 --> 00:04:33.679
the shrinking of the chorus,

00:04:33.679 --> 00:04:36.056
the addition of three actors,

00:04:36.056 --> 00:04:37.656
and such catharsis.

00:04:37.656 --> 00:04:41.453
Doesn't a great tragedy just make you feel
renewed and cleansed?

00:04:41.453 --> 00:04:44.469
It sure does, but now we are out of time.

00:04:44.469 --> 00:04:45.862
I'm Seacrestopolis,

00:04:45.862 --> 00:04:47.710
and I'm Mario Lopedokia.

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:49.581
Peace, love and catharsis.
