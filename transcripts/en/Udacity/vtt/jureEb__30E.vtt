00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:03.885
The key idea when rationalizing a denominator is to choose a way to multiply by

00:00:03.885 --> 00:00:07.305
a form of one, so this denominator ends up simplifying to something that

00:00:07.305 --> 00:00:12.942
doesn't contain a radical. So, if we want to get the power of 4 up to the power

00:00:12.942 --> 00:00:18.980
of 6. We need to multiply it by two more factors of 2 inside of a cubed root.

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:23.280
We have to use an index of three here since this is also an index of 3. If the

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:27.438
indexes match, then we can multiply these radicants together to get 2 to the

00:00:27.438 --> 00:00:31.346
4th times 2 squared, which is 2 to the 6th.
