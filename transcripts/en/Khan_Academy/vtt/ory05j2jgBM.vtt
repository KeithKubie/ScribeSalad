00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:01.650
- [Voiceover] What I
wanna do in this video

00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:05.590
is compare the fractions 3/4

00:00:05.590 --> 00:00:08.220
and 4/5,

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:12.220
and I wanna do this visually.

00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:14.350
So what I'm gonna do is
I'm gonna have two copies

00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:18.150
of the same whole, so
let me just draw that,

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:20.720
but I'm gonna divide the first one,

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:25.190
so this is one whole right
over here, this rectangle,

00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:27.120
when we draw the whole thing.

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:29.220
So this is a whole,

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:32.450
and right below that,
we have the same whole.

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:35.690
We have a rectangle of
exactly the same size.

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:42.320
Now you might notice
that I've divided them

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:45.550
into a different number of equal sections.

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:50.550
In the top one, I've divided
it into four equal sections

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:54.290
because I am concerned with fourths

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:58.850
so I've divided this
top whole into fourths

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:02.382
and I've divided this bottom
whole, or this bottom bar

00:01:02.382 --> 00:01:07.080
or this bottom rectangle, into fifths,

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:11.600
or five equal sections.

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:15.890
So let's think about what 3/4 represent.

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:20.240
So that's gonna be one of
the fourths, right over here,

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:24.500
two of the fourths,

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:28.890
and then three of the fourths.

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.350
And what is 4/5 going to be?

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:35.070
Well, 4/5 is going to be one fifth,

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:37.660
two fifths,

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:43.590
three fifths, and four fifths.

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:46.190
So when you look at
them visually, remember,

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:48.290
we're taking fractions of the same whole.

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:50.050
This is 3/4 of that rectangle,

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:53.120
this is 4/5 of a same-sized rectangle.

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:54.550
It wouldn't make any
sense if you're doing it

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:57.190
for different shapes or
different sized rectangles.

00:01:57.190 --> 00:01:58.850
We just divided them
into different sections

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:01.310
and you see that if you
have four of the fifths,

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:04.710
that that is going to be more

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:07.550
than three of the fourths,

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:11.620
and so 4/5 is greater than 3/4

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:15.590
or you could say 3/4 is less than 4/5,

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:17.250
or any way you wanna think about it.

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:21.890
The symbol you wanna use always
opens to the larger number.

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:23.750
4/5 is larger than 3/4,

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:28.690
so the large end of our
symbol is facing the 4/5,

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:33.140
so we would say 3/4 is less than 4/5.
