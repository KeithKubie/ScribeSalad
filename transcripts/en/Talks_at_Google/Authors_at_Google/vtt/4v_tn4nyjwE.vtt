AMY E. HERMAN:
Thank you very much

00:00:09.310 --> 00:00:11.720
for that lovely introduction.

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:15.680
I have to say, visually, this
rug up here is beautiful.

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:17.427
Thank you for having me.

00:00:17.427 --> 00:00:18.760
It's a pleasure to be at Google.

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:22.230
And I'm going to try to
condense my three-hour training

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:25.460
session into about 45 minutes,
because I'd like to leave time

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:27.940
for Q&amp;A. But I'd like
to review some rules

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:30.430
that I have for every
session where I present.

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:33.500
The first rule is that
you need to interrupt me

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:36.630
with any questions, comments, or
feedback you have at the time.

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:38.250
I have no train of thought.

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:39.750
I will go right
back to where I was.

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:41.670
Don't worry about
interrupting me.

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:44.630
The second rule is you don't
need to write anything down.

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:46.570
I prefer that you engage
in the conversation

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:48.170
and looking at the works of art.

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:50.750
And the last rule is
the hardest to follow--

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:53.620
that I ask you that for the
next 45 minutes to an hour

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:55.730
that we're together to
refrain from using two

00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:58.810
words-- obviously and clearly.

00:00:58.810 --> 00:01:00.590
Try to do that for
the rest of the day,

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:01.740
and even for the
rest of the week,

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:03.156
and when you go
back to your work,

00:01:03.156 --> 00:01:05.400
for the very simple reason
that we live and work

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.350
in a very complex world.

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:10.205
Very little is obvious,
and even less is clear.

00:01:10.205 --> 00:01:12.330
So rather than saying,
obviously, it's a case of X,

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.204
I would prefer that you
say, it appears to me

00:01:14.204 --> 00:01:16.740
to be a case of X
because of Y and Z. OK?

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:18.380
Those are my only rules.

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:20.390
So if you look at
the first slide

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:22.000
that I've put up
on the screen, I

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.130
try to put thought
into my opening slide.

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:26.750
How am I going to ease people
into thinking differently

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:29.940
about works of art that we
see and how we communicate

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:31.000
about those works?

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:32.789
And I'm showing you
the largest equestrian

00:01:32.789 --> 00:01:33.830
sculpture in the country.

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:35.288
You don't have to
worry about that.

00:01:35.288 --> 00:01:36.920
It's in Irving, Texas.

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:38.700
But what I love
about this sculpture,

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:39.950
it's counterintuitive.

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:42.000
The horses are
completely stationary

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.800
and the water is moving.

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:47.190
The water moves 24/7
and the horses don't.

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:48.620
And so I want to
orient your brain

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:50.370
to thinking differently
about works of art

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:51.950
and communicating what we see.

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:53.450
So I'm going to put
you to work now.

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:54.800
It's the post-lunch coma.

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:56.860
Can you please put your
right hand up in the air?

00:01:56.860 --> 00:01:58.282
Right hand up in the air.

00:01:58.282 --> 00:01:59.740
And you can only
put your hand down

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:01.114
when you see
something definitive

00:02:01.114 --> 00:02:03.570
and unequivocal in the
slide that I've put up,

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:05.570
that you could describe
to somebody who

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:08.032
was not looking at the slide.

00:02:08.032 --> 00:02:09.990
If you see something
definitive and unequivocal

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:11.115
you can put your hand down.

00:02:11.115 --> 00:02:13.199
Now, the majority of you
still have your hands up.

00:02:13.199 --> 00:02:15.364
So I'm going to tell you
that what you're looking at

00:02:15.364 --> 00:02:16.130
is a mammal.

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:18.140
If you see a mammal
definit-- now it's funny.

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:19.140
Some hands are going up.

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:19.690
They're coming down.

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:21.064
They're going up
and coming down.

00:02:21.064 --> 00:02:23.636
Now, if you see this mammal
you can put your hand down.

00:02:23.636 --> 00:02:25.760
Now for those of you that
still have your hands up,

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:26.960
the mammal has four legs.

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:29.460
I'm going to tell you that the
mammal that you're looking at

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:30.060
has four legs.

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:33.030
If you see a four-legged mammal,
you can put your hand down.

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:35.077
You can all put
your hands down now.

00:02:35.077 --> 00:02:36.910
I'm going to show you
an overexposed version

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:41.860
of this photograph and show
you what you were looking at.

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:43.690
You were looking at a cow.

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:45.300
Now, go back to this slide.

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:46.580
Do you see it now?

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:47.790
Sure you do.

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:50.240
It's very hard to unsee
what I've just shown you.

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:52.780
Now this is not a trick
photograph in any way.

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:55.430
It was designed by a man
named Dr. Samuel Renshaw.

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:58.320
It's familiarly known
as the "Renshaw Cow".

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:00.630
And he trained Navy
pilots in World War II

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:02.550
to discern enemy warfare.

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:04.940
And he designed a series
of visual exercises.

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:08.750
And I begin with this exercise
not to disarm you in any way,

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:11.710
but to share an experience
that I had about two years ago,

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:14.432
when I went to hear a man
named Apollo Robbins speak.

00:03:14.432 --> 00:03:16.890
Now, for those of you who don't
know who Apollo Robbins is,

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:18.730
he's a professional
con man, for lack

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:21.430
of a better term, who now works
on the right side of the law.

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:22.440
I had heard about him.

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:24.050
I wanted to hear
what he had to say.

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:26.060
He was standing at the
door of the auditorium

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:27.480
where I went to hear him speak.

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:29.690
And he shook everyone's
hand who came in the door.

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:32.530
And I got to the door and
my bracelets were gone.

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:34.130
And he took people's watches.

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:35.760
And he took the
glasses off their head.

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:38.310
And no one had any idea
that their stuff was gone.

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:42.540
So after he returned our things,
he started with this exercise.

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:44.560
I attended the evening
with a colleague of mine.

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:46.050
And when he put this
slide up and asked

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:47.990
us to do what I asked you to
do-- to put our right hand up

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:50.448
in the air and put it down when
we see something definitive

00:03:50.448 --> 00:03:53.110
and unequivocal-- my colleague
put her hand down right away.

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:53.820
And I'm looking.

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:56.020
And I'm thinking, is
that a flying platypus?

00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:57.490
And I'm thinking
is that a kitten?

00:03:57.490 --> 00:03:58.140
Is that an owl?

00:03:58.140 --> 00:03:59.640
I didn't know what
I was looking at.

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:02.440
And I kept my hand raised
in the air the entire time.

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:04.700
Robin leans over and
whispers in my ear.

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:07.110
"I can't believe you
don't see this," she says.

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:08.110
And it makes me nervous.

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:10.151
And then I start to sweat
profusely, because this

00:04:10.151 --> 00:04:11.392
is what I do for a living.

00:04:11.392 --> 00:04:13.350
I help people enhance
their observation skills.

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:15.800
And I could have looked at
this slide the rest of the day

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:16.950
and never seen a cow.

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:19.620
So I begin with the
premise that no two people

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:21.060
see anything the same way.

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:23.460
Did anyone in the room
see the cow, initially?

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:24.090
One,

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:25.220
AUDIENCE: I still
don't see the cow.

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:26.360
AMY E. HERMAN: You
still don't see the cow?

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:27.031
OK.

00:04:27.031 --> 00:04:27.530
That's OK.

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:28.580
[LAUGHTER]

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:29.490
It's there.

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:31.166
So there were two
of you in the room

00:04:31.166 --> 00:04:32.290
that saw the cow initially.

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:33.030
AUDIENCE: Oh, OK, now I see it.

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:33.550
AMY E. HERMAN: Now you get it.

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:34.270
OK, good.

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:35.160
Good, because the
outline's there.

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:35.930
AUDIENCE: The face of the cow.

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:37.346
AMY E. HERMAN:
Yeah, there you go.

00:04:37.346 --> 00:04:41.580
So no two people see
anything the same way.

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:44.160
So I show you a painting
now, a 16th century painting

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:46.320
by Giuseppe Arcimboldo.

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:49.304
And the painting on the left is
called "The Vegetable Gardner".

00:04:49.304 --> 00:04:50.970
And if you look at
it, it's a black bowl

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:53.360
with chestnuts and onions
and leeks and turnips.

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:56.350
And when you turn it
upside down, it's a head.

00:04:56.350 --> 00:04:58.790
And it reminded me of the
line Dr. Wayne Dyer said,

00:04:58.790 --> 00:05:02.182
that the reason for his success
was that he teaches people--

00:05:02.182 --> 00:05:04.390
"If you change the way you
look at things, the things

00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:06.410
you look at change."

00:05:06.410 --> 00:05:08.230
I say that twice. "If
you change the way

00:05:08.230 --> 00:05:11.040
you look at things, the
things you look at change."

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:14.210
I see my role, in teaching
the art of perception,

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:16.360
as helping people to
change the way they

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:21.380
look at things by using
art as the data to do that.

00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:23.630
My course is called The Art
of Perception-- Rethinking

00:05:23.630 --> 00:05:24.890
How We See.

00:05:24.890 --> 00:05:26.130
I started it in 2000.

00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:29.400
I am a recovering attorney
and an art historian.

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:32.500
And I like to think that I've
taken the practical aspects

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:35.039
of each of those disciplines
and melded them together

00:05:35.039 --> 00:05:36.580
into this program
that I started when

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:38.996
I was the Head of Education
at the Frick Collection in New

00:05:38.996 --> 00:05:39.640
York City.

00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:42.430
It started as a program
for medical students only.

00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:44.420
The idea was let's take
medical students out

00:05:44.420 --> 00:05:46.406
of the clinical setting,
out of the hospital,

00:05:46.406 --> 00:05:48.030
bring them to an art
museum, teach them

00:05:48.030 --> 00:05:50.040
how to look at works of
art so when they go back

00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:52.050
into the hospital and back
into the clinical setting,

00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:53.966
they'll be better observers
of their patients.

00:05:53.966 --> 00:05:56.270
It wasn't rocket science,
and it wasn't my idea.

00:05:56.270 --> 00:05:58.450
It came from the Yale
Center for British Art.

00:05:58.450 --> 00:05:59.930
And with their
gracious permission,

00:05:59.930 --> 00:06:02.019
I started a version
of it at the Frick.

00:06:02.019 --> 00:06:03.060
Everything was wonderful.

00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:05.143
I was working with seven
different medical schools

00:06:05.143 --> 00:06:05.850
at the Frick.

00:06:05.850 --> 00:06:08.370
And then one evening in
2004, I went out to dinner

00:06:08.370 --> 00:06:09.180
with friends.

00:06:09.180 --> 00:06:11.138
And I was telling them
that my medical students

00:06:11.138 --> 00:06:12.510
had unbelievable myopia.

00:06:12.510 --> 00:06:15.859
It was diagnosis in physiology
and anatomy and pathology

00:06:15.859 --> 00:06:16.400
all the time.

00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:18.510
And they knew nothing
about art-- which is fine.

00:06:18.510 --> 00:06:20.875
But they didn't know
anything except medicine.

00:06:20.875 --> 00:06:22.750
A friend of mine said,
why are you just doing

00:06:22.750 --> 00:06:24.021
this for medical students?

00:06:24.021 --> 00:06:25.520
Why aren't you doing
this for people

00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:27.950
who really need good
observation skills?

00:06:27.950 --> 00:06:28.700
I said, like whom?

00:06:28.700 --> 00:06:29.630
He said, like cops.

00:06:29.630 --> 00:06:32.140
Why are you doing this
for homicide detectives?

00:06:32.140 --> 00:06:34.144
And I thought, that's
a really good idea.

00:06:34.144 --> 00:06:35.810
So Monday morning, I
picked up the phone

00:06:35.810 --> 00:06:36.980
and I called the NYPD.

00:06:36.980 --> 00:06:38.520
I start very big.

00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:39.565
Picked up the phone.

00:06:39.565 --> 00:06:40.940
And I want you to
picture the guy

00:06:40.940 --> 00:06:42.290
at the switchboard at the NYPD.

00:06:42.290 --> 00:06:44.107
And I said, hello, my
name is Amy Herman.

00:06:44.107 --> 00:06:46.190
I'm the Head of Education
at the Frick Collection.

00:06:46.190 --> 00:06:47.959
I have a great idea.

00:06:47.959 --> 00:06:50.500
I said, I train medical students
to enhance their observation

00:06:50.500 --> 00:06:51.000
skills.

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:54.090
And I think you should
send homicide detectives.

00:06:54.090 --> 00:06:56.670
Dead silence on the
other end of the phone.

00:06:56.670 --> 00:06:58.260
I was transferred
seven times until I

00:06:58.260 --> 00:07:02.895
got to a Deputy
Commissioner who I knew

00:07:02.895 --> 00:07:04.020
he heard what I was saying.

00:07:04.020 --> 00:07:06.850
Because he said, Ms. Herman,
if this is such a visual thing,

00:07:06.850 --> 00:07:09.490
why are we on the phone?

00:07:09.490 --> 00:07:12.170
Six months later, every
newly-promoted captain

00:07:12.170 --> 00:07:14.170
in the NYPD had to come
to the Frick Collection,

00:07:14.170 --> 00:07:17.660
learn to look at
objects with me.

00:07:17.660 --> 00:07:19.560
And it was a wonderful program.

00:07:19.560 --> 00:07:22.870
Eventually, just to fast forward
to explain how I got here,

00:07:22.870 --> 00:07:24.250
"The Wall Street
Journal" called.

00:07:24.250 --> 00:07:26.110
They wanted to know what I was
doing with cops at the Frick

00:07:26.110 --> 00:07:28.589
Collection, like something
illicit was going on.

00:07:28.589 --> 00:07:30.130
And I invited the
Wall Street Journal

00:07:30.130 --> 00:07:31.660
to come see the classes.

00:07:31.660 --> 00:07:33.244
Nine months later,
an article came out

00:07:33.244 --> 00:07:35.201
on the front page of "The
Wall Street Journal".

00:07:35.201 --> 00:07:38.200
And it said, to master the art
of solving crime, cops study

00:07:38.200 --> 00:07:40.110
Vermeer at the Frick.

00:07:40.110 --> 00:07:43.150
And what I didn't know was
that the reporter not only came

00:07:43.150 --> 00:07:45.150
to my classes, but she
went out onto the streets

00:07:45.150 --> 00:07:47.510
and the precincts of New
York City, asking these cops,

00:07:47.510 --> 00:07:49.760
how are you doing your jobs
differently after learning

00:07:49.760 --> 00:07:51.799
to look at works of art?

00:07:51.799 --> 00:07:53.590
So after "The Wall
Street Journal" article,

00:07:53.590 --> 00:07:55.920
every inbox in my life exploded.

00:07:55.920 --> 00:07:57.890
And I got calls from
all over the world.

00:07:57.890 --> 00:08:01.200
From the FBI and the CIA and the
military and first responders,

00:08:01.200 --> 00:08:02.992
and lawyers and doctors
and social workers.

00:08:02.992 --> 00:08:04.408
And they all said
the same thing--

00:08:04.408 --> 00:08:07.250
come teach us how to see like
you did those cops in New York.

00:08:07.250 --> 00:08:09.050
I can't teach anyone how to see.

00:08:09.050 --> 00:08:11.400
You either know how to see--
as Leonardo da Vinci called

00:08:11.400 --> 00:08:14.590
it, "Saper Vedere",
to know how to see.

00:08:14.590 --> 00:08:15.451
Can't teach it.

00:08:15.451 --> 00:08:17.450
But what I can do and
what I'm going to do today

00:08:17.450 --> 00:08:19.033
is give you an
overview of the program

00:08:19.033 --> 00:08:21.965
that I run for all
surveillance agents of the FBI

00:08:21.965 --> 00:08:24.040
and all new analysts at the CIA.

00:08:24.040 --> 00:08:26.060
I train the Navy SEALs.

00:08:26.060 --> 00:08:28.290
I work with first
responders, military.

00:08:28.290 --> 00:08:29.872
I do all of that.

00:08:29.872 --> 00:08:31.580
And I don't tell you
about all the places

00:08:31.580 --> 00:08:33.784
where I teach to tell
you how busy I am.

00:08:33.784 --> 00:08:35.159
But rather, it's
to tell you what

00:08:35.159 --> 00:08:38.140
I've noticed is that
everyone in my sessions

00:08:38.140 --> 00:08:40.419
already has good observation
and perception skills.

00:08:40.419 --> 00:08:42.299
That's not the problem.

00:08:42.299 --> 00:08:44.490
The problem I've seen is
in the consistent breakdown

00:08:44.490 --> 00:08:47.494
of effective communication
between what we see

00:08:47.494 --> 00:08:48.160
and what we say.

00:08:48.160 --> 00:08:52.030
Something gets lost from here
to here, to here, and to here.

00:08:52.030 --> 00:08:54.130
Something gets lost.

00:08:54.130 --> 00:08:55.304
So I try to remedy that.

00:08:55.304 --> 00:08:56.970
That's my goal in the
art of perception,

00:08:56.970 --> 00:08:58.470
using art as the data.

00:08:58.470 --> 00:09:01.614
And I tell my participants
they have to do four things.

00:09:01.614 --> 00:09:04.030
Every new situation, every new
problem, every new witness,

00:09:04.030 --> 00:09:05.613
every new patient,
you do four things.

00:09:05.613 --> 00:09:07.110
You assess your situation.

00:09:07.110 --> 00:09:07.994
You analyze it.

00:09:07.994 --> 00:09:09.160
You decide what's important.

00:09:09.160 --> 00:09:09.630
What do I need?

00:09:09.630 --> 00:09:10.510
What don't I need?

00:09:10.510 --> 00:09:11.649
You articulate it.

00:09:11.649 --> 00:09:12.440
You write a report.

00:09:12.440 --> 00:09:13.080
You tell someone.

00:09:13.080 --> 00:09:14.621
You send an e-mail,
you write a text.

00:09:14.621 --> 00:09:15.890
And then you act.

00:09:15.890 --> 00:09:16.970
Then you make a decision.

00:09:16.970 --> 00:09:19.630
You adapt your behavior based
on the other three things

00:09:19.630 --> 00:09:20.730
that you do.

00:09:20.730 --> 00:09:21.840
So now I travel the world.

00:09:21.840 --> 00:09:23.190
I quit my full-time job.

00:09:23.190 --> 00:09:25.320
And I now teach The
Art of Perception,

00:09:25.320 --> 00:09:29.600
my three-hour course for
CEOs, philanthropy, education.

00:09:29.600 --> 00:09:33.100
And I still work very much
in the intelligence community

00:09:33.100 --> 00:09:35.020
and law enforcement.

00:09:35.020 --> 00:09:36.401
Why art?

00:09:36.401 --> 00:09:37.650
Well, first of all, I love it.

00:09:37.650 --> 00:09:39.030
That's what I'm trained in.

00:09:39.030 --> 00:09:42.200
But as Jonathan and I were
just speaking about this,

00:09:42.200 --> 00:09:44.270
art gives us a
tremendous opportunity

00:09:44.270 --> 00:09:47.610
to look at the innovative, the
creative, the new, the exigent,

00:09:47.610 --> 00:09:48.160
the chaotic.

00:09:48.160 --> 00:09:49.700
Like the painting
on the left-- you

00:09:49.700 --> 00:09:52.130
have men and women,
and children and dogs,

00:09:52.130 --> 00:09:54.910
and birds and sunlight,
and alcohol and babies.

00:09:54.910 --> 00:09:56.840
You have all kinds
of things going on.

00:09:56.840 --> 00:09:59.110
You could talk about
that painting forever.

00:09:59.110 --> 00:10:02.760
But the painting on the right
is much simpler, much simpler.

00:10:02.760 --> 00:10:04.880
It's a black bowl
with a red vase.

00:10:04.880 --> 00:10:06.674
And it has five quinces in it.

00:10:06.674 --> 00:10:07.590
No, they're not pears.

00:10:07.590 --> 00:10:08.160
They're not apples.

00:10:08.160 --> 00:10:08.810
Who cares what they are?

00:10:08.810 --> 00:10:09.770
But they're quinces.

00:10:09.770 --> 00:10:11.269
Art gives us the
opportunity to talk

00:10:11.269 --> 00:10:13.010
about very complicated
situations,

00:10:13.010 --> 00:10:16.990
very simple situations,
and everything in between.

00:10:16.990 --> 00:10:19.340
So that's why I use art.

00:10:19.340 --> 00:10:21.100
This is not about
Picasso versus Pollock.

00:10:21.100 --> 00:10:21.600
OK?

00:10:21.600 --> 00:10:23.550
I if you know anything
about art, that's wonderful.

00:10:23.550 --> 00:10:25.508
But you need to leave it
at the door for today.

00:10:25.508 --> 00:10:26.476
Except you.

00:10:26.476 --> 00:10:28.720
You don't have to leave
your knowledge at the door.

00:10:28.720 --> 00:10:30.678
I ask that you leave your
substantive knowledge

00:10:30.678 --> 00:10:32.740
at the door because
we're using art as data,

00:10:32.740 --> 00:10:35.660
as a fresh set of
data to rethink skills

00:10:35.660 --> 00:10:40.490
that we use every day in
our professional context.

00:10:40.490 --> 00:10:42.730
Now you can groan if you
want when you see this.

00:10:42.730 --> 00:10:45.030
But I can sum up
my entire course

00:10:45.030 --> 00:10:47.130
in these two
non-artistic images.

00:10:47.130 --> 00:10:48.860
For those of you who don't know
what the slide on the right

00:10:48.860 --> 00:10:50.216
is, about a year
and a half ago--

00:10:50.216 --> 00:10:51.049
AUDIENCE: It's blue!

00:10:51.049 --> 00:10:51.799
[LAUGHTER]

00:10:51.799 --> 00:10:52.840
AMY E. HERMAN: Thank you.

00:10:52.840 --> 00:10:53.340
Thank you.

00:10:53.340 --> 00:10:54.429
I'm in total agreement.

00:10:54.429 --> 00:10:56.220
A year and a half ago,
this woman in the UK

00:10:56.220 --> 00:10:57.970
purchased this dress
to wear in a wedding.

00:10:57.970 --> 00:10:59.640
And for reasons still
unbeknownst to me,

00:10:59.640 --> 00:11:02.470
she posted on Facebook and
said, what color is my dress?

00:11:02.470 --> 00:11:06.960
And my initial response was who
cares what color your dress is?

00:11:06.960 --> 00:11:08.670
But the question
and the responses

00:11:08.670 --> 00:11:11.090
went viral to the tone
of hundreds of millions

00:11:11.090 --> 00:11:12.120
of people chimed in.

00:11:12.120 --> 00:11:16.740
Raise your hand if you see this
photograph as white and gold.

00:11:16.740 --> 00:11:17.709
Look at that.

00:11:17.709 --> 00:11:18.750
Now, put your hands down.

00:11:18.750 --> 00:11:21.208
If you're sane like I am, and
you see it as blue and black,

00:11:21.208 --> 00:11:22.030
put your hand up.

00:11:22.030 --> 00:11:25.220
So in this room,
we're about 50-50.

00:11:25.220 --> 00:11:27.800
In my classes,
it's usually 60-40.

00:11:27.800 --> 00:11:30.520
60% see it as white and
gold, 39%, blue and black.

00:11:30.520 --> 00:11:32.490
And 1% sees it purple,
gray, green and brown,

00:11:32.490 --> 00:11:33.990
and I don't want
to know about that.

00:11:33.990 --> 00:11:35.600
That just complicates
everything.

00:11:35.600 --> 00:11:39.250
So half of my class
addresses the issue

00:11:39.250 --> 00:11:41.220
that no two people see
anything the same way.

00:11:41.220 --> 00:11:42.190
That's half the class.

00:11:42.190 --> 00:11:44.648
The other half the class is
addressed by the Domino's Pizza

00:11:44.648 --> 00:11:46.210
box.

00:11:46.210 --> 00:11:48.690
|n May of 2015, there was a
particularly heinous crime

00:11:48.690 --> 00:11:50.130
committed in Washington DC.

00:11:50.130 --> 00:11:52.340
A CEO, his wife,
their 10-year-old boy

00:11:52.340 --> 00:11:54.590
and their housekeeper were
held hostage in their home.

00:11:54.590 --> 00:11:56.756
They were killed and then
the house was set on fire.

00:11:56.756 --> 00:11:58.420
You may remember
hearing about this.

00:11:58.420 --> 00:12:01.690
And the morning after the fire,
the Crime Scene Investigation

00:12:01.690 --> 00:12:04.390
team came from the Washington
Metropolitan Police Department.

00:12:04.390 --> 00:12:06.910
And one of those investigators
had the wherewithal

00:12:06.910 --> 00:12:09.690
not only to see the Domino's
Pizza box on the floor

00:12:09.690 --> 00:12:12.897
in the kitchen, but to say,
out loud to his colleagues,

00:12:12.897 --> 00:12:14.730
do you think this is
the kind of family that

00:12:14.730 --> 00:12:16.960
would order a Domino's Pizza?

00:12:16.960 --> 00:12:20.689
This family, in this house
here, in this neighborhood?

00:12:20.689 --> 00:12:22.480
Do you think they'd
order a Domino's Pizza?

00:12:22.480 --> 00:12:24.310
And with a gloved hand,
he lifted the box.

00:12:24.310 --> 00:12:27.067
And there were two
discarded crusts in the box.

00:12:27.067 --> 00:12:27.900
He took one of them.

00:12:27.900 --> 00:12:29.990
He sent it for DNA analysis.

00:12:29.990 --> 00:12:31.650
They had a suspect
within 48 hours

00:12:31.650 --> 00:12:34.700
based on the DNA and the
saliva on the pizza crust.

00:12:34.700 --> 00:12:37.984
Now, in my world, we say
that's excellent police work.

00:12:37.984 --> 00:12:39.400
But it's something
more than that.

00:12:39.400 --> 00:12:41.400
And you have to forgive
me for the terrible pun.

00:12:41.400 --> 00:12:42.780
It's thinking outside the box.

00:12:42.780 --> 00:12:43.694
I'm sorry.

00:12:43.694 --> 00:12:44.584
I'm sorry.

00:12:44.584 --> 00:12:45.750
And I even hate that phrase.

00:12:45.750 --> 00:12:47.450
But it's so appropriate here.

00:12:47.450 --> 00:12:50.817
So my class is about the
idea that no two people

00:12:50.817 --> 00:12:51.900
see anything the same way.

00:12:51.900 --> 00:12:53.900
And you know what, who
cares about a dumb dress?

00:12:53.900 --> 00:12:54.430
I don't.

00:12:54.430 --> 00:12:56.180
I don't care who sees
it as white and gold

00:12:56.180 --> 00:12:57.440
and who sees it
as blue and black.

00:12:57.440 --> 00:12:59.390
But what happens in the
real world, when two of you

00:12:59.390 --> 00:13:00.710
are at the same
meeting, or two of you

00:13:00.710 --> 00:13:02.050
are in the operating
room, or two of you

00:13:02.050 --> 00:13:03.510
are interviewing
the same witness,

00:13:03.510 --> 00:13:05.490
and you walk away
with fundamentally

00:13:05.490 --> 00:13:07.700
different perceptions
of what you just saw?

00:13:07.700 --> 00:13:09.280
What do you do then?

00:13:09.280 --> 00:13:10.697
That's what I'm
trying to address.

00:13:10.697 --> 00:13:12.321
And the other half
of the class, having

00:13:12.321 --> 00:13:13.860
to do with the
Domino's Pizza boxes,

00:13:13.860 --> 00:13:16.070
we need to solve
problems creatively.

00:13:16.070 --> 00:13:18.019
We can't just do the
same thing all the time.

00:13:18.019 --> 00:13:19.810
It worked last time,
let's do it this time.

00:13:19.810 --> 00:13:21.954
It doesn't work that way.

00:13:21.954 --> 00:13:23.870
So I ask you to shift
your perspective with me

00:13:23.870 --> 00:13:26.320
this afternoon, to
think differently

00:13:26.320 --> 00:13:27.820
about what we're looking at.

00:13:27.820 --> 00:13:30.050
Because my goal is, as much
fun as I want this to be,

00:13:30.050 --> 00:13:31.810
when you walk out the door, I
want you thinking differently

00:13:31.810 --> 00:13:32.630
about your work.

00:13:32.630 --> 00:13:35.320
So I'm going to ask you to shift
your perspective like JR did.

00:13:35.320 --> 00:13:37.900
For those of you who don't
know JR, he's a photographer.

00:13:37.900 --> 00:13:39.846
He takes pictures of
people, mostly women,

00:13:39.846 --> 00:13:41.720
blows them up to billboard
size and puts them

00:13:41.720 --> 00:13:42.511
all over the world.

00:13:42.511 --> 00:13:44.384
Runways, buildings,
public places.

00:13:44.384 --> 00:13:45.800
And there were
some countries that

00:13:45.800 --> 00:13:48.040
hated his work so much
that they thought he

00:13:48.040 --> 00:13:49.590
was defacing public property.

00:13:49.590 --> 00:13:51.929
So they issued warrants
for his arrest.

00:13:51.929 --> 00:13:54.470
And while these warrants were
pending-- he's very famous now.

00:13:54.470 --> 00:13:56.626
There are no warrants
pending anymore.

00:13:56.626 --> 00:13:58.250
But when they were,
he was commissioned

00:13:58.250 --> 00:13:59.386
to do this self-portrait.

00:13:59.386 --> 00:14:00.510
And I think it's brilliant.

00:14:00.510 --> 00:14:05.580
It's called "Self-Portrait in
a Woman's Eye, Kenya, 2009".

00:14:05.580 --> 00:14:06.470
What did he do?

00:14:06.470 --> 00:14:09.369
He shifted his perspective
on what a self-portrait is.

00:14:09.369 --> 00:14:11.410
And he took a picture of
himself in a woman's eye

00:14:11.410 --> 00:14:13.180
without revealing
his facial identity.

00:14:13.180 --> 00:14:13.835
Why?

00:14:13.835 --> 00:14:15.460
Because it would
facilitate his arrest.

00:14:15.460 --> 00:14:17.170
Who wants to get arrested?

00:14:17.170 --> 00:14:20.080
So he created this by
shifting his perspective.

00:14:20.080 --> 00:14:22.730
Why do you need to
shift your perspective?

00:14:22.730 --> 00:14:25.260
Because this is the complicated
world we live in now.

00:14:25.260 --> 00:14:26.830
I work with people
that are dealing

00:14:26.830 --> 00:14:28.940
with mass shootings,
civil rights

00:14:28.940 --> 00:14:33.500
issues, terrorist bombings, and
the ongoing problem of ISIS.

00:14:33.500 --> 00:14:36.980
But before we can wrap our heads
around all the complex problems

00:14:36.980 --> 00:14:38.750
we're facing in
our world today, we

00:14:38.750 --> 00:14:41.370
have to realize that they're
matters of perception.

00:14:41.370 --> 00:14:45.680
And how we communicate, what
we perceive those issues to be,

00:14:45.680 --> 00:14:48.240
is of critical importance.

00:14:48.240 --> 00:14:50.130
So we need to shift
our perspective

00:14:50.130 --> 00:14:52.850
to think about the
world we live in.

00:14:52.850 --> 00:14:55.337
Now, I'm showing you an
icon in art history, again,

00:14:55.337 --> 00:14:56.420
shifting your perspective.

00:14:56.420 --> 00:15:00.170
It's called "Luncheon on
the Grass", by Manet, 1863.

00:15:00.170 --> 00:15:01.160
What do you have here?

00:15:01.160 --> 00:15:03.010
It's very modern, two
fully-clothed men,

00:15:03.010 --> 00:15:04.151
a completely naked woman.

00:15:04.151 --> 00:15:05.650
Her clothes, her
food are over here.

00:15:05.650 --> 00:15:07.649
There's a woman back here,
playing in the water,

00:15:07.649 --> 00:15:08.720
oblivious to everything.

00:15:08.720 --> 00:15:10.500
It's just one of those
paintings everyone

00:15:10.500 --> 00:15:12.190
who studies art history knows.

00:15:12.190 --> 00:15:15.320
100 years later, look
what Picasso did with it.

00:15:15.320 --> 00:15:16.570
He turned it on its head.

00:15:16.570 --> 00:15:18.840
You still sort of have
the two fully-clothed men.

00:15:18.840 --> 00:15:20.340
You definitely have
the naked woman.

00:15:20.340 --> 00:15:21.550
Her food is over here.

00:15:21.550 --> 00:15:23.800
There's another naked
woman in the back.

00:15:23.800 --> 00:15:29.100
And he just turned the
entire icon of art history,

00:15:29.100 --> 00:15:30.550
he turned it upside down.

00:15:30.550 --> 00:15:32.590
Because the premise is
that no two people see

00:15:32.590 --> 00:15:34.436
anything the same way.

00:15:34.436 --> 00:15:36.060
Now when we talk
about problem solving,

00:15:36.060 --> 00:15:38.920
the same artist, Manet, entered
into a contractual relationship

00:15:38.920 --> 00:15:42.050
in 1880 with a collector,
Charles Ephrussi.

00:15:42.050 --> 00:15:44.550
Manet was going to paint this
little painting of asparagus--

00:15:44.550 --> 00:15:48.060
it's about this big-- for
the sum of 800 francs.

00:15:48.060 --> 00:15:50.350
When Ephrussi sent
him the check,

00:15:50.350 --> 00:15:53.200
the check was for 1,000
francs instead of 800.

00:15:53.200 --> 00:15:54.320
And Manet was perplexed.

00:15:54.320 --> 00:15:54.990
He didn't know what to do.

00:15:54.990 --> 00:15:56.940
You don't issue refunds
in the 19th century.

00:15:56.940 --> 00:15:59.140
What do you do with
the extra 200 francs?

00:15:59.140 --> 00:16:01.434
So this is what Manet did.

00:16:01.434 --> 00:16:03.850
He painted a single asparagus
and sent it to the collector

00:16:03.850 --> 00:16:06.300
with a note that said, one
fell out of your bunch.

00:16:06.300 --> 00:16:10.480
This is about solving
problems creatively.

00:16:10.480 --> 00:16:12.960
Don't just fall into a pattern
of doing the same thing all

00:16:12.960 --> 00:16:14.920
the time.

00:16:14.920 --> 00:16:16.270
So how do I do this?

00:16:16.270 --> 00:16:20.830
How, when I have
audiences, 99.9% of whom

00:16:20.830 --> 00:16:23.270
have not studied
art in any way, they

00:16:23.270 --> 00:16:25.500
don't have a trained
eye in art history.

00:16:25.500 --> 00:16:27.020
And a very high
percentage of them

00:16:27.020 --> 00:16:28.510
have never been
to an art museum.

00:16:28.510 --> 00:16:30.780
How do I make art
relevant for them,

00:16:30.780 --> 00:16:33.424
and help them change the
way they do their work?

00:16:33.424 --> 00:16:35.090
The book, "Visual
Intelligence" that you

00:16:35.090 --> 00:16:37.830
have is a natural
outgrowth of this course.

00:16:37.830 --> 00:16:39.900
But what I've tried to
do is take works of art--

00:16:39.900 --> 00:16:42.890
like you see on the screen--
ask my participants to step

00:16:42.890 --> 00:16:47.000
in really closely to these
works of art, and ask questions.

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:49.020
Ask such precise
questions that they

00:16:49.020 --> 00:16:50.820
will ascertain that
this work of art

00:16:50.820 --> 00:16:53.870
is a wooden board with
10,000 galvanized nails

00:16:53.870 --> 00:16:57.090
and one unbroken
piece of thread.

00:16:57.090 --> 00:16:59.960
The whole thing is made from
one unbroken piece of thread.

00:16:59.960 --> 00:17:01.700
And I know what you're
probably thinking.

00:17:01.700 --> 00:17:02.990
So what?

00:17:02.990 --> 00:17:04.980
Yeah, that's really cool.

00:17:04.980 --> 00:17:06.300
That's visually compelling.

00:17:06.300 --> 00:17:06.949
But so what?

00:17:06.949 --> 00:17:08.490
What does it have
to do with my work?

00:17:08.490 --> 00:17:10.420
It has everything to
do with your work,

00:17:10.420 --> 00:17:11.770
and those of my participants.

00:17:11.770 --> 00:17:13.353
Because I know that
you're not looking

00:17:13.353 --> 00:17:16.800
at works of art for a living,
but you are asking questions.

00:17:16.800 --> 00:17:19.220
Everyone I work with
has to ask questions.

00:17:19.220 --> 00:17:22.410
And I want to make sure that
my program can help them frame

00:17:22.410 --> 00:17:25.460
the questions to elicit the
information they need to do

00:17:25.460 --> 00:17:27.000
their jobs more effectively.

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:30.480
So is it relevant, 10,000 nails,
one unbroken piece of thread?

00:17:30.480 --> 00:17:33.560
Yes it is, because
how'd you get there?

00:17:33.560 --> 00:17:36.609
So I show you now two portraits
of the lovely Mrs. Maud Dale.

00:17:36.609 --> 00:17:38.400
Her husband, Chester,
was a philanthropist.

00:17:38.400 --> 00:17:42.489
He gave his money and he gave
his art collections to museums

00:17:42.489 --> 00:17:43.280
around the country.

00:17:43.280 --> 00:17:45.510
And he commissioned Leger, on
the left, and George Bellows,

00:17:45.510 --> 00:17:46.844
on the right, to paint his wife.

00:17:46.844 --> 00:17:49.051
If I didn't tell you that
these were the same person,

00:17:49.051 --> 00:17:50.460
would you necessarily know it?

00:17:50.460 --> 00:17:51.780
Probably not.

00:17:51.780 --> 00:17:55.070
No two people see
anyone the same way.

00:17:55.070 --> 00:17:56.610
This goes for
situations as well.

00:17:56.610 --> 00:17:59.500
Two paintings by Matisse, "The
Open Window at Coolioure".

00:17:59.500 --> 00:18:01.170
The one on the
left is from 1905.

00:18:01.170 --> 00:18:03.670
And the one on the
right is from 1914.

00:18:03.670 --> 00:18:05.230
Matisse changed his
mind about how he

00:18:05.230 --> 00:18:06.438
saw the scene out the window.

00:18:06.438 --> 00:18:09.390
By 1914, the world
was a bleaker place.

00:18:09.390 --> 00:18:12.182
It was on the eve of World
War I. His town in France

00:18:12.182 --> 00:18:13.640
had been taken over
by the Germans.

00:18:13.640 --> 00:18:15.339
His brother was a prisoner.

00:18:15.339 --> 00:18:16.130
Things were darker.

00:18:16.130 --> 00:18:18.090
No more pretty boats,
blues, greens, and pinks out

00:18:18.090 --> 00:18:18.590
the window.

00:18:18.590 --> 00:18:20.134
So Matisse changed his mind.

00:18:20.134 --> 00:18:22.550
Now the fact that you're sitting
in the room with me today

00:18:22.550 --> 00:18:24.050
tells me that you don't
paint for a living.

00:18:24.050 --> 00:18:26.100
I don't think any of
you paint for a living.

00:18:26.100 --> 00:18:27.552
You don't have this option.

00:18:27.552 --> 00:18:28.760
You can't get away with this.

00:18:28.760 --> 00:18:31.340
If somebody asks, why did
you make a certain decision?

00:18:31.340 --> 00:18:33.480
You can't say, because
I felt like it.

00:18:33.480 --> 00:18:35.370
We're accountable
for our decisions.

00:18:35.370 --> 00:18:35.975
I saw this.

00:18:35.975 --> 00:18:36.600
I noticed this.

00:18:36.600 --> 00:18:38.250
I perceived this to
be the situation.

00:18:38.250 --> 00:18:40.530
Therefore, I acted accordingly.

00:18:40.530 --> 00:18:43.710
It would be nice if we could
all be Matisse, but we can't.

00:18:43.710 --> 00:18:47.240
Now, I show you this
sculpture by Anish Kapoor.

00:18:47.240 --> 00:18:49.520
It's many, many, many
pieces of stainless steel,

00:18:49.520 --> 00:18:51.978
assembled in such a way that
when you stand in front of it,

00:18:51.978 --> 00:18:54.150
you see 5,000
versions of yourself.

00:18:54.150 --> 00:18:57.290
It's a reminder to us that
self perception is critical.

00:18:57.290 --> 00:18:59.740
It's critical to professional
and personal growth.

00:18:59.740 --> 00:19:01.760
You need to know
what you look like.

00:19:01.760 --> 00:19:03.220
I have short hair.

00:19:03.220 --> 00:19:04.340
I have very short hair.

00:19:04.340 --> 00:19:06.400
I didn't always have short hair.

00:19:06.400 --> 00:19:08.120
But I had to start a
chemotherapy regimen

00:19:08.120 --> 00:19:09.470
a year and a half ago.

00:19:09.470 --> 00:19:10.970
I was bald as an eagle.

00:19:10.970 --> 00:19:14.420
I shaved my head so I wouldn't
lose my hair to chemotherapy.

00:19:14.420 --> 00:19:16.220
And after I shaved my
head, my best friends

00:19:16.220 --> 00:19:18.090
took me to this
sculpture and made

00:19:18.090 --> 00:19:22.190
me see 5000 versions
of my bald self,

00:19:22.190 --> 00:19:25.110
so I would know what I would
look like for the next year.

00:19:25.110 --> 00:19:26.627
It wasn't pretty.

00:19:26.627 --> 00:19:28.210
But I needed to know
what I look like.

00:19:28.210 --> 00:19:31.220
And knowing what we look like,
literally and figuratively,

00:19:31.220 --> 00:19:32.052
is critical.

00:19:32.052 --> 00:19:33.760
You need to know if
your colleagues can't

00:19:33.760 --> 00:19:36.010
talk to you before your
third cup of coffee.

00:19:36.010 --> 00:19:38.370
You need to know if you don't
like to talk on the phone.

00:19:38.370 --> 00:19:40.828
I tell people that I had a new
boss at the Frick Collection

00:19:40.828 --> 00:19:43.171
who sent me an email on his
first day in all capital

00:19:43.171 --> 00:19:43.670
letters.

00:19:43.670 --> 00:19:47.440
Did you ever get an email from
someone in all capital letters?

00:19:47.440 --> 00:19:49.600
And I thought,
it's his first day.

00:19:49.600 --> 00:19:50.600
Is he already mad at me?

00:19:50.600 --> 00:19:51.500
Is he being emphatic?

00:19:51.500 --> 00:19:52.958
Did the Caps Lock
button get stuck?

00:19:52.958 --> 00:19:54.150
What's the problem here?

00:19:54.150 --> 00:19:55.820
And I did what he
asked me to do.

00:19:55.820 --> 00:19:57.569
But do you know, for
the next eight years,

00:19:57.569 --> 00:20:00.000
every email from that man came
in in all capital letters.

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:01.852
And I really wish I'd
had the wherewithal,

00:20:01.852 --> 00:20:03.810
by the end of my tenure
at the Frick Collection

00:20:03.810 --> 00:20:06.765
to say to him, enough
with the all caps.

00:20:06.765 --> 00:20:08.390
Your work isn't
getting done any faster

00:20:08.390 --> 00:20:10.890
because you send people
emails in all capital letters.

00:20:10.890 --> 00:20:13.997
You need to know
how you come across.

00:20:13.997 --> 00:20:16.080
People always want to show
you how smart they are.

00:20:16.080 --> 00:20:17.913
I'm sure here at Google,
that never happens.

00:20:17.913 --> 00:20:21.462
But people often want to
show you how smart they are.

00:20:21.462 --> 00:20:23.170
And when I put these
two works of art up,

00:20:23.170 --> 00:20:24.360
and I say, OK who's
going to tell me

00:20:24.360 --> 00:20:27.026
the similarities and differences
between these two works of art?

00:20:27.026 --> 00:20:27.940
Oh, the hands go up.

00:20:27.940 --> 00:20:30.090
That's easy, they say.

00:20:30.090 --> 00:20:32.610
You have two people on the
left, a man and a woman.

00:20:32.610 --> 00:20:34.110
You have two people
on the right.

00:20:34.110 --> 00:20:35.321
It's two men.

00:20:35.321 --> 00:20:37.570
They have hair on the left,
they're bald on the right.

00:20:37.570 --> 00:20:39.153
They're white on the
left, one's white

00:20:39.153 --> 00:20:40.420
and one's black on the right.

00:20:40.420 --> 00:20:41.600
I've had people
even say, oh they're

00:20:41.600 --> 00:20:43.349
straight on the left
and gay on the right.

00:20:43.349 --> 00:20:45.890
How would you know that, by
looking at a work of art?

00:20:45.890 --> 00:20:48.490
What I really want the astute
observer to say though,

00:20:48.490 --> 00:20:49.770
lay the foundation.

00:20:49.770 --> 00:20:50.640
Lay the groundwork.

00:20:50.640 --> 00:20:52.130
Tell me that you're
looking at two works of art

00:20:52.130 --> 00:20:53.860
and the one on the
left is a painting,

00:20:53.860 --> 00:20:56.015
and the one on the
right is a photograph.

00:20:56.015 --> 00:20:58.140
Because if I'm on the
receiving end of your e-mail,

00:20:58.140 --> 00:21:00.054
I can't see what you see.

00:21:00.054 --> 00:21:02.720
And people are always in a hurry
to show you how smart they are.

00:21:02.720 --> 00:21:06.250
And they forget to lay that
very critical foundation.

00:21:06.250 --> 00:21:08.200
And then I want the
astute observer to really

00:21:08.200 --> 00:21:09.900
be more astute
and say, you know,

00:21:09.900 --> 00:21:11.740
I'm looking at two works of art.

00:21:11.740 --> 00:21:13.250
The one on the
left is a painting.

00:21:13.250 --> 00:21:14.791
The one on the right
is a photograph.

00:21:14.791 --> 00:21:18.840
Each one has two people, and
I'm looking at them in profile.

00:21:18.840 --> 00:21:20.320
Because your brain sees it.

00:21:20.320 --> 00:21:22.160
Your eyes see it.

00:21:22.160 --> 00:21:24.930
And yet, we think it's so
blatantly obvious, hence

00:21:24.930 --> 00:21:27.910
my prohibition on using
the word obviously.

00:21:27.910 --> 00:21:30.280
We need to say what
we see before deciding

00:21:30.280 --> 00:21:31.470
to show how smart we are.

00:21:31.470 --> 00:21:32.860
There's plenty of
time and opportunity

00:21:32.860 --> 00:21:33.690
to show how smart you are.

00:21:33.690 --> 00:21:35.130
Like, look at these
two paintings.

00:21:35.130 --> 00:21:38.380
The one of the left is by
Lucas Cranach, the Elder, 1630.

00:21:38.380 --> 00:21:41.580
And one of the right
is 2015, called

00:21:41.580 --> 00:21:42.950
"Intestines and Tassels".

00:21:42.950 --> 00:21:45.880
Isn't that wonderful?
"Intestines and Tassels".

00:21:45.880 --> 00:21:47.851
So here, we begin
to contextualize.

00:21:47.851 --> 00:21:50.100
This is where you say, I
have a headless female figure

00:21:50.100 --> 00:21:52.110
on the right and I
have a headless figure

00:21:52.110 --> 00:21:53.490
somewhere on the left.

00:21:53.490 --> 00:21:56.190
Viscera in both
pictures, a gold chain

00:21:56.190 --> 00:21:58.080
that's referenced
in both paintings.

00:21:58.080 --> 00:21:59.544
This is where you contextualize.

00:21:59.544 --> 00:22:01.460
This is where you can
talk about how smart you

00:22:01.460 --> 00:22:04.510
are, how many patterns
you recognize,

00:22:04.510 --> 00:22:06.920
how many common threads
you can pull together.

00:22:06.920 --> 00:22:09.400
But don't forget to
lay the groundwork

00:22:09.400 --> 00:22:12.330
and lay the foundation.

00:22:12.330 --> 00:22:14.070
My theme-- I have a
theme in my program

00:22:14.070 --> 00:22:16.420
called handsome women
of the 18th century.

00:22:16.420 --> 00:22:17.870
And this is one of them.

00:22:17.870 --> 00:22:20.545
Her name is lovely Mrs.
Hannah Winthrop, 1773.

00:22:20.545 --> 00:22:22.170
She's probably the
most important slide

00:22:22.170 --> 00:22:23.253
in the whole presentation.

00:22:23.253 --> 00:22:25.840
If you remember just one
thing, the lovely Mrs. Hannah

00:22:25.840 --> 00:22:26.340
Winthrop.

00:22:26.340 --> 00:22:27.030
Why?

00:22:27.030 --> 00:22:30.780
She has a red-and-white
bow in her bonnet.

00:22:30.780 --> 00:22:31.440
She's brunette.

00:22:31.440 --> 00:22:34.714
She has dimples, multiple chins,
multiple pearls, blue silk

00:22:34.714 --> 00:22:37.130
dress, blue-and-white bow,
sitting in a upholstered chair,

00:22:37.130 --> 00:22:38.714
holding two nectarines.

00:22:38.714 --> 00:22:41.130
And you say, well, what does
that have to do with my work?

00:22:41.130 --> 00:22:42.817
Why could she possibly
be so important?

00:22:42.817 --> 00:22:45.150
If you see along the bottom
one quarter of the painting,

00:22:45.150 --> 00:22:46.620
this mahogany table.

00:22:46.620 --> 00:22:48.870
And you see this incredible
reflection in the mahogany

00:22:48.870 --> 00:22:52.120
table of her lace and her skin
of her forearm and her fingers,

00:22:52.120 --> 00:22:53.670
and even the stem
of the nectarine.

00:22:53.670 --> 00:22:55.090
You say, well so what?

00:22:55.090 --> 00:22:58.590
If I were to ask any of you
to describe this painting,

00:22:58.590 --> 00:23:01.020
more than 50% of you would
probably omit the table

00:23:01.020 --> 00:23:02.094
from your description.

00:23:02.094 --> 00:23:03.260
And you think well, so what?

00:23:03.260 --> 00:23:04.109
Who cares?

00:23:04.109 --> 00:23:04.900
Here's the problem.

00:23:04.900 --> 00:23:07.450
It's hiding in plain sight.

00:23:07.450 --> 00:23:08.880
There are things
that you are not

00:23:08.880 --> 00:23:10.954
seeing that are right
in front of your eyes.

00:23:10.954 --> 00:23:12.870
Have you ever said to a
colleague or a friend,

00:23:12.870 --> 00:23:14.910
how did I miss that?

00:23:14.910 --> 00:23:15.930
How did I miss that?

00:23:15.930 --> 00:23:17.220
It was right there.

00:23:17.220 --> 00:23:19.847
So the way to get
around mahogany tables

00:23:19.847 --> 00:23:21.430
is to ask other
people to collaborate.

00:23:21.430 --> 00:23:22.399
Say, here's my issue.

00:23:22.399 --> 00:23:23.190
Here's the problem.

00:23:23.190 --> 00:23:24.564
This is how I hope
to resolve it.

00:23:24.564 --> 00:23:26.880
Is there something here
I might be missing?

00:23:26.880 --> 00:23:29.360
Do you see something
that I don't?

00:23:29.360 --> 00:23:31.480
It's critical.

00:23:31.480 --> 00:23:33.630
So now I'm going to get
you to start working.

00:23:33.630 --> 00:23:34.922
Look at these two works of art.

00:23:34.922 --> 00:23:37.338
And I want you to tell me how
they're similar or different

00:23:37.338 --> 00:23:37.840
in any way.

00:23:37.840 --> 00:23:39.780
And don't say
obviously or clearly.

00:23:39.780 --> 00:23:42.725
How are they similar
or different?

00:23:42.725 --> 00:23:43.600
I'll give you a hint.

00:23:43.600 --> 00:23:45.270
They're both paintings.

00:23:45.270 --> 00:23:46.177
Yes?

00:23:46.177 --> 00:23:47.676
AUDIENCE: There's
one figure holding

00:23:47.676 --> 00:23:48.800
a thing in each of them.

00:23:48.800 --> 00:23:49.190
AMY E. HERMAN: Yes.

00:23:49.190 --> 00:23:51.180
Each of the women in these
pictures is holding something.

00:23:51.180 --> 00:23:53.400
The woman on the left is
holding a picture of a nude man.

00:23:53.400 --> 00:23:54.930
And the woman on the
right is knitting.

00:23:54.930 --> 00:23:55.430
What else?

00:23:55.430 --> 00:23:56.334
I saw another hand.

00:23:56.334 --> 00:23:59.047
AUDIENCE: They're both
in sort of a 3/4 profile.

00:23:59.047 --> 00:24:01.130
AMY E. HERMAN: Yes, they're
both in a 3/4 profile.

00:24:01.130 --> 00:24:02.840
They're oriented to the left.

00:24:02.840 --> 00:24:03.392
What else?

00:24:03.392 --> 00:24:04.630
AUDIENCE: They're
both wearing hats.

00:24:04.630 --> 00:24:05.410
AMY E. HERMAN: They're
both wearing hats.

00:24:05.410 --> 00:24:06.420
I'm going to tweak
that a little.

00:24:06.420 --> 00:24:08.711
I'm going to say, they both
have things on their heads.

00:24:08.711 --> 00:24:11.100
The woman on the left has a
headband, pearl and feathers.

00:24:11.100 --> 00:24:12.150
The woman on the
right has a cloth.

00:24:12.150 --> 00:24:14.410
Hat isn't wrong, but if
we're looking for precision

00:24:14.410 --> 00:24:15.410
in language-- what else?

00:24:15.410 --> 00:24:16.810
Similarities and differences?

00:24:16.810 --> 00:24:17.730
Yes?

00:24:17.730 --> 00:24:19.110
AUDIENCE: One is smiling.

00:24:19.110 --> 00:24:20.030
One is not.

00:24:20.030 --> 00:24:21.600
AMY E. HERMAN: Yes, the
woman on the left is smiling.

00:24:21.600 --> 00:24:23.260
Not only is she smiling,
we can see her teeth.

00:24:23.260 --> 00:24:25.218
We don't know the tooth
situation on the right.

00:24:25.218 --> 00:24:26.820
And we have a closed mouth.

00:24:26.820 --> 00:24:27.320
Yes?

00:24:27.320 --> 00:24:29.000
AUDIENCE: One is
young and one's older.

00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:29.833
AMY E. HERMAN: Yeah.

00:24:29.833 --> 00:24:31.580
One seems to be
younger than the other.

00:24:31.580 --> 00:24:32.810
The woman on the right
appears to be older.

00:24:32.810 --> 00:24:33.510
Anything else.

00:24:33.510 --> 00:24:34.856
Yes?

00:24:34.856 --> 00:24:37.754
AUDIENCE: One's attention
is one what is in her hand.

00:24:37.754 --> 00:24:41.107
And the other's attention is
on what looks like the viewer.

00:24:41.107 --> 00:24:42.190
AMY E. HERMAN: Absolutely.

00:24:42.190 --> 00:24:45.080
The woman on the right appears
to be looking down and absorbed

00:24:45.080 --> 00:24:45.770
by her knitting.

00:24:45.770 --> 00:24:47.980
And the woman on the left is
looking out at us and smiling.

00:24:47.980 --> 00:24:49.320
I don't mean to
rush things along.

00:24:49.320 --> 00:24:50.445
I don't have a lot of time.

00:24:50.445 --> 00:24:53.410
But is anybody going
to notice this?

00:24:53.410 --> 00:24:56.560
Is anybody going
to talk about this?

00:24:56.560 --> 00:24:58.994
People say, oh yeah, I
was going to get to it.

00:24:58.994 --> 00:25:00.410
I know what you're
thinking, maybe

00:25:00.410 --> 00:25:02.000
somebody else will say it.

00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:04.690
She's showing a lot of
cleavage on the left.

00:25:04.690 --> 00:25:06.940
Her neckline is so low.

00:25:06.940 --> 00:25:09.495
And the woman on the right,
her neckline is so high.

00:25:09.495 --> 00:25:10.870
There are lots of
ways to say it.

00:25:10.870 --> 00:25:12.740
You know, my cops will say,
oh, her neckline is so low,

00:25:12.740 --> 00:25:14.490
her breasts are spilling
out of her dress.

00:25:14.490 --> 00:25:15.660
That's OK.

00:25:15.660 --> 00:25:17.110
Because you're never going to
get in trouble for saying what

00:25:17.110 --> 00:25:17.610
you see.

00:25:17.610 --> 00:25:19.540
Saying what you think
is a whole other story.

00:25:19.540 --> 00:25:21.001
But you need to
say what you see.

00:25:21.001 --> 00:25:22.750
And you don't have the
professional option

00:25:22.750 --> 00:25:24.870
to look away from what makes
you uncomfortable, what

00:25:24.870 --> 00:25:26.786
you don't like, and what
you don't understand.

00:25:26.786 --> 00:25:28.570
As someone said to
me not too long ago,

00:25:28.570 --> 00:25:30.710
do not ignore the
elephant in the room.

00:25:30.710 --> 00:25:33.620
It will stomp on
you and kill you.

00:25:33.620 --> 00:25:35.030
Don't do it.

00:25:35.030 --> 00:25:37.850
Now, I'm going to make an
assumption that you all

00:25:37.850 --> 00:25:39.060
know who these gentlemen are.

00:25:39.060 --> 00:25:41.070
Now for purposes of my
session this afternoon,

00:25:41.070 --> 00:25:42.710
the one on the left is number
1, and the one on the right

00:25:42.710 --> 00:25:44.280
is number 16, just
to make it easy.

00:25:44.280 --> 00:25:47.700
And I want to expand your model
of inquiry from who, what,

00:25:47.700 --> 00:25:50.160
where, when, to include body
language, facial expression,

00:25:50.160 --> 00:25:52.820
nonverbal communication,
and eye contact.

00:25:52.820 --> 00:25:56.200
Thinking about those
aspects, how are these images

00:25:56.200 --> 00:25:57.196
similar or different?

00:25:57.196 --> 00:25:59.070
And don't tell me they're
both dead white men

00:25:59.070 --> 00:26:00.140
who were President
of the United States.

00:26:00.140 --> 00:26:00.799
We know that.

00:26:00.799 --> 00:26:02.840
How are the images similar
or different, thinking

00:26:02.840 --> 00:26:04.465
about body language,
facial expression,

00:26:04.465 --> 00:26:07.890
nonverbal communication
and eye contact?

00:26:07.890 --> 00:26:09.930
Yes?

00:26:09.930 --> 00:26:10.430
Yeah, you

00:26:10.430 --> 00:26:12.846
AUDIENCE: The one on the left
is demonstrating the things.

00:26:12.846 --> 00:26:14.786
The one on the right,
his body language is in.

00:26:14.786 --> 00:26:16.501
He's not demonstrating anything.

00:26:16.501 --> 00:26:18.250
AMY E. HERMAN: I like
the way you said it.

00:26:18.250 --> 00:26:20.500
But rather than say that number
one is demonstrating things,

00:26:20.500 --> 00:26:21.700
let's stick to observation.

00:26:21.700 --> 00:26:23.090
His hand is extended.

00:26:23.090 --> 00:26:23.990
How's that?

00:26:23.990 --> 00:26:27.320
And you said that number
16's hands are internal,

00:26:27.320 --> 00:26:28.120
or turned in.

00:26:28.120 --> 00:26:28.620
Good.

00:26:28.620 --> 00:26:30.930
What else?

00:26:30.930 --> 00:26:31.430
Yes?

00:26:31.430 --> 00:26:33.900
AUDIENCE: One is
a formal meeting,

00:26:33.900 --> 00:26:37.358
showing him in the
height of his grandeur,

00:26:37.358 --> 00:26:39.828
it was probably
painted after the fact.

00:26:39.828 --> 00:26:41.298
And the other one
is a photograph,

00:26:41.298 --> 00:26:42.298
taken now in the moment.

00:26:42.298 --> 00:26:43.300
AMY E. HERMAN: Yeah.

00:26:43.300 --> 00:26:45.815
95% of my classes, nobody ever
says, number 1's a painting

00:26:45.815 --> 00:26:47.054
and number 16's a photograph.

00:26:47.054 --> 00:26:49.470
They think it's so blatantly
obvious, who needs to say it?

00:26:49.470 --> 00:26:50.185
Guess what?

00:26:50.185 --> 00:26:51.560
If I'm getting
your email, I have

00:26:51.560 --> 00:26:53.020
no idea what you're looking at.

00:26:53.020 --> 00:26:55.040
You need to tell me one's a
painting, one's a photograph.

00:26:55.040 --> 00:26:57.248
My homicide detectives a
couple weeks ago yelled out,

00:26:57.248 --> 00:26:59.296
number one's wearing a dress!

00:26:59.296 --> 00:27:00.420
Number 16's wearing a suit.

00:27:00.420 --> 00:27:01.620
That's a difference too.

00:27:01.620 --> 00:27:03.060
But I'm not trying
to Where's Waldo you.

00:27:03.060 --> 00:27:04.476
But did anybody
notice the rainbow

00:27:04.476 --> 00:27:07.350
in the upper right-hand
corner of number 1?

00:27:07.350 --> 00:27:09.080
I'm not trying to
trick you here.

00:27:09.080 --> 00:27:11.080
But it is a critical to looking
at the portrait of number 1?

00:27:11.080 --> 00:27:11.360
No.

00:27:11.360 --> 00:27:12.026
Is it important?

00:27:12.026 --> 00:27:13.030
Absolutely.

00:27:13.030 --> 00:27:15.094
Because there are
probably 25,000 portraits

00:27:15.094 --> 00:27:17.260
of George Washington in the
history of American art.

00:27:17.260 --> 00:27:18.060
Wait a second.

00:27:18.060 --> 00:27:19.990
The one we saw that Art
of Perception session

00:27:19.990 --> 00:27:21.120
had a rainbow in it.

00:27:21.120 --> 00:27:23.440
By remembering one detail,
you've narrowed it down

00:27:23.440 --> 00:27:25.694
from 25,000 to 3.

00:27:25.694 --> 00:27:27.860
Imagine how that can work
in your professional life,

00:27:27.860 --> 00:27:31.050
if you remember one small detail
about one client, about one

00:27:31.050 --> 00:27:34.490
transaction, about one problem,
one patient, one crime scene.

00:27:34.490 --> 00:27:38.660
And if you ever wondered about
the power of facial expression,

00:27:38.660 --> 00:27:42.295
nonverbal communication, eye
contact, and body language,

00:27:42.295 --> 00:27:44.230
did you ever see this picture?

00:27:44.230 --> 00:27:44.957
Sure you have.

00:27:44.957 --> 00:27:47.040
And if I asked you for
your visual analysis of it,

00:27:47.040 --> 00:27:48.581
I don't want to hear
Osama bin Laden.

00:27:48.581 --> 00:27:49.970
Because he's not in the picture.

00:27:49.970 --> 00:27:53.440
It's 12 to 14 people looking
fraught and anxious and

00:27:53.440 --> 00:27:54.184
nervous.

00:27:54.184 --> 00:27:56.100
And they're looking at
something we can't see.

00:27:56.100 --> 00:27:57.670
Intellectually, we may know
what they're looking at.

00:27:57.670 --> 00:27:59.150
But we don't know what
they're looking at.

00:27:59.150 --> 00:28:00.900
We can't see what
they're looking at.

00:28:00.900 --> 00:28:02.300
And to show you different
perspectives, when

00:28:02.300 --> 00:28:04.591
I train officers who are
about to deploy to Afghanistan

00:28:04.591 --> 00:28:06.417
and I say, what do you
see in this picture?

00:28:06.417 --> 00:28:08.500
They'll say, you know, the
only guy doing any work

00:28:08.500 --> 00:28:11.040
in that picture is in uniform.

00:28:11.040 --> 00:28:12.350
Because that's what they see.

00:28:12.350 --> 00:28:14.077
That's where their eyes go.

00:28:14.077 --> 00:28:16.410
Now, I'm going to ask you to
compare and contrast these.

00:28:16.410 --> 00:28:18.370
And please don't say what
my NYPD officers say,

00:28:18.370 --> 00:28:20.360
every time without exception,
don't say before marriage

00:28:20.360 --> 00:28:21.060
and after.

00:28:21.060 --> 00:28:24.940
That's not the comparison
I'm looking for.

00:28:24.940 --> 00:28:27.060
It's not what I'm looking for.

00:28:27.060 --> 00:28:31.654
How are these pictures similar
or different in any way?

00:28:31.654 --> 00:28:33.990
AUDIENCE: The upper
figure has her hands out.

00:28:33.990 --> 00:28:37.747
And the bottom figure
has her hand underneath--

00:28:37.747 --> 00:28:39.330
AMY E. HERMAN: Under
her right breast.

00:28:39.330 --> 00:28:40.110
AUDIENCE: Yes,
that is what it is.

00:28:40.110 --> 00:28:41.360
AMY E. HERMAN: Yes, that's it.

00:28:41.360 --> 00:28:42.357
I'll say anything.

00:28:42.357 --> 00:28:44.940
So the woman in the top picture
has her hands behind her head.

00:28:44.940 --> 00:28:46.398
And the woman in
the bottom picture

00:28:46.398 --> 00:28:48.560
has one hand on the couch
and one hand cupping

00:28:48.560 --> 00:28:49.340
her right breast.

00:28:49.340 --> 00:28:52.060
Although in my detective class
in the NYPD, a couple weeks

00:28:52.060 --> 00:28:54.480
ago, someone said-- this is
why I wrote a book, because I

00:28:54.480 --> 00:28:56.063
couldn't make this
stuff up-- he said,

00:28:56.063 --> 00:28:59.080
how do you know someone's
not trapped under there?

00:28:59.080 --> 00:29:01.240
And I thought, I would
have never thought

00:29:01.240 --> 00:29:04.020
of that in a million years.

00:29:04.020 --> 00:29:05.770
This is why I write a
book, because people

00:29:05.770 --> 00:29:07.170
say incredible things.

00:29:07.170 --> 00:29:07.670
What else?

00:29:07.670 --> 00:29:08.800
Similarities and differences?

00:29:08.800 --> 00:29:09.210
Yes?

00:29:09.210 --> 00:29:10.550
AUDIENCE: One has the
eyes open, eyes closed.

00:29:10.550 --> 00:29:12.780
AMY E. HERMAN: Yes, women in
top picture has her eyes open.

00:29:12.780 --> 00:29:14.270
The woman in the bottom
picture has her eyes closed.

00:29:14.270 --> 00:29:15.000
What else?

00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:16.910
AUDIENCE: There's no
background drapery.

00:29:16.910 --> 00:29:19.620
AMY E. HERMAN: Yes, no
background and drapery.

00:29:19.620 --> 00:29:20.416
Yes, what else?

00:29:20.416 --> 00:29:22.290
AUDIENCE: They're leaning
on different sides.

00:29:22.290 --> 00:29:23.831
AMY E. HERMAN: Yes,
they're reclining

00:29:23.831 --> 00:29:24.940
in different directions.

00:29:24.940 --> 00:29:27.000
What else?

00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:27.642
Yes?

00:29:27.642 --> 00:29:29.100
AUDIENCE: They're
both naked women.

00:29:29.100 --> 00:29:31.230
AMY E. HERMAN: They're
both naked white women

00:29:31.230 --> 00:29:32.350
who are brunettes.

00:29:32.350 --> 00:29:33.519
What else?

00:29:33.519 --> 00:29:35.060
AUDIENCE: One is
slim and one is not.

00:29:35.060 --> 00:29:36.101
AMY E. HERMAN: Thank you.

00:29:36.101 --> 00:29:37.820
He just said, one is
slim and one is not.

00:29:37.820 --> 00:29:39.770
That's all we have to say.

00:29:39.770 --> 00:29:41.770
But that's not even the
reason I juxtaposed them

00:29:41.770 --> 00:29:42.787
for your comparison.

00:29:42.787 --> 00:29:44.870
I was going to stand here
until somebody mentioned

00:29:44.870 --> 00:29:46.578
the difference in
their girth, because it

00:29:46.578 --> 00:29:48.625
is a sizable difference.

00:29:48.625 --> 00:29:50.250
Eight years ago I
put these pictures up

00:29:50.250 --> 00:29:52.020
at a psychiatric conference.

00:29:52.020 --> 00:29:54.039
And a very senior
psychiatrist stood up.

00:29:54.039 --> 00:29:55.830
And he said, with the
most beautiful accent

00:29:55.830 --> 00:29:57.660
I've ever heard-- he
gave me permission

00:29:57.660 --> 00:30:00.076
not only to repeat his comments,
but to imitate his accent

00:30:00.076 --> 00:30:01.440
because I did a good job of it.

00:30:01.440 --> 00:30:03.690
He said, (WITH ACCENT) the
woman in the bottom picture

00:30:03.690 --> 00:30:04.772
is morbidly obese.

00:30:04.772 --> 00:30:06.980
He was from South Africa
beautiful, beautiful accent.

00:30:06.980 --> 00:30:08.360
He said, (WITH ACCENT) The
woman in the bottom picture's

00:30:08.360 --> 00:30:09.300
morbidly obese.

00:30:09.300 --> 00:30:11.341
The woman in the top
picture's perfectly healthy.

00:30:11.341 --> 00:30:13.860
And I said, you know doctor,
with all due respect,

00:30:13.860 --> 00:30:15.985
can you really tell me the
woman in the top picture

00:30:15.985 --> 00:30:17.240
is perfectly healthy?

00:30:17.240 --> 00:30:19.460
I said, how do you know
she's not schizophrenic?

00:30:19.460 --> 00:30:21.543
How do you know she doesn't
have a blood disorder?

00:30:21.543 --> 00:30:23.050
How do you know she's not deaf?

00:30:23.050 --> 00:30:24.297
And he said, oh I'm so sorry.

00:30:24.297 --> 00:30:25.630
I can't believe how wrong I was.

00:30:25.630 --> 00:30:26.546
I said, you know what?

00:30:26.546 --> 00:30:27.300
You weren't wrong.

00:30:27.300 --> 00:30:30.210
Your choice of words was poor.

00:30:30.210 --> 00:30:31.910
And this is my
opportunity to tell

00:30:31.910 --> 00:30:34.010
my sessions there are
very, very few things that

00:30:34.010 --> 00:30:36.050
are 100% in your control.

00:30:36.050 --> 00:30:38.500
Choice of words is one of them.

00:30:38.500 --> 00:30:42.060
Both in speaking and in writing,
choice of words is up to you.

00:30:42.060 --> 00:30:45.170
And I implore my classes,
don't make poor word choices.

00:30:45.170 --> 00:30:47.370
I hear people do
it all the time.

00:30:47.370 --> 00:30:50.430
I want you to tell me what you
see here, not what you think.

00:30:50.430 --> 00:30:52.960
What do you see in this picture?

00:30:52.960 --> 00:30:53.732
Yes?

00:30:53.732 --> 00:30:56.197
AUDIENCE: It's a photograph
of a middle-aged looking--

00:30:56.197 --> 00:30:58.530
AMY E. HERMAN: Ah, I'm very
sensitive to the term middle

00:30:58.530 --> 00:30:59.030
age.

00:30:59.030 --> 00:31:01.869
Give me a ballpark here.

00:31:01.869 --> 00:31:02.910
AUDIENCE: Oh, of her age?

00:31:02.910 --> 00:31:03.814
AMY E. HERMAN: Yeah.

00:31:03.814 --> 00:31:04.941
AUDIENCE: Over 30?

00:31:04.941 --> 00:31:05.690
AMY E. HERMAN: OK.

00:31:05.690 --> 00:31:06.301
Fair enough.

00:31:06.301 --> 00:31:06.800
Fair enough.

00:31:06.800 --> 00:31:08.630
Because middle aged
to me is 35 to 70.

00:31:08.630 --> 00:31:10.380
So over 30 is good.

00:31:10.380 --> 00:31:14.200
So you see a picture of two
people, a woman who's over 30

00:31:14.200 --> 00:31:14.907
and what else?

00:31:14.907 --> 00:31:17.089
AUDIENCE: I see a
boy, a small one.

00:31:17.089 --> 00:31:17.922
AMY E. HERMAN: Good.

00:31:17.922 --> 00:31:18.422
Good.

00:31:18.422 --> 00:31:22.610
She's a woman, and she's wearing
a low-cut round scoop dress.

00:31:22.610 --> 00:31:25.880
And she appears to be
holding a child who is a boy

00:31:25.880 --> 00:31:27.490
and has blond hair
and blue eyes.

00:31:27.490 --> 00:31:28.900
What else?

00:31:28.900 --> 00:31:29.400
Yes?

00:31:29.400 --> 00:31:31.010
AUDIENCE: Her teeth
seem wrong to me.

00:31:31.010 --> 00:31:32.770
AMY E. HERMAN: Yes, she has
a gap in her front teeth,

00:31:32.770 --> 00:31:33.340
absolutely.

00:31:33.340 --> 00:31:34.380
She has a gap in
her front teeth.

00:31:34.380 --> 00:31:35.830
We don't know the
child's tooth situation

00:31:35.830 --> 00:31:37.020
at all from this picture.

00:31:37.020 --> 00:31:39.021
What else?

00:31:39.021 --> 00:31:39.520
Yes?

00:31:39.520 --> 00:31:40.990
AUDIENCE: That they're
different races.

00:31:40.990 --> 00:31:42.864
AMY E. HERMAN: They are
different races, yes.

00:31:42.864 --> 00:31:44.130
The child appears to be white.

00:31:44.130 --> 00:31:47.930
And the woman has darker skin
than the child, has brown skin.

00:31:47.930 --> 00:31:49.884
Now let's go someplace
that's not so safe.

00:31:49.884 --> 00:31:52.050
What do you think the
relationship between these two

00:31:52.050 --> 00:31:53.890
people could be?

00:31:53.890 --> 00:31:54.720
What could it be?

00:31:54.720 --> 00:31:55.786
AUDIENCE: Adopted mother.

00:31:55.786 --> 00:31:57.410
AMY E. HERMAN: Could
be adopted mother.

00:31:57.410 --> 00:31:58.450
Could be foster mother.

00:31:58.450 --> 00:31:59.900
Could be biological mother.

00:31:59.900 --> 00:32:00.800
AUDIENCE: Nanny?

00:32:00.800 --> 00:32:01.680
AMY E. HERMAN: Nanny?

00:32:01.680 --> 00:32:02.462
What else?

00:32:02.462 --> 00:32:03.420
AUDIENCE: Friend's kid.

00:32:03.420 --> 00:32:05.181
AMY E. HERMAN:
Friend's kid, neighbor.

00:32:05.181 --> 00:32:05.930
AUDIENCE: Teacher.

00:32:05.930 --> 00:32:07.270
AMY E. HERMAN: Teacher,
health care worker,

00:32:07.270 --> 00:32:08.700
it could be almost anyone.

00:32:08.700 --> 00:32:11.460
The only answer I don't allow--
I train hostage negotiators.

00:32:11.460 --> 00:32:13.043
And they say, maybe
she kidnapped him.

00:32:13.043 --> 00:32:14.110
She did not kidnap him.

00:32:14.110 --> 00:32:16.190
That's the only
answer I don't allow.

00:32:16.190 --> 00:32:18.310
She could be anybody.

00:32:18.310 --> 00:32:21.280
So years ago, I
put this slide up.

00:32:21.280 --> 00:32:23.870
And I said to the group--
it was in New Orleans-- what

00:32:23.870 --> 00:32:25.340
do you think the relationship
between these two people

00:32:25.340 --> 00:32:25.620
could be?

00:32:25.620 --> 00:32:27.786
And a woman in the back of
the room raised her hand.

00:32:27.786 --> 00:32:30.207
She said, it's the
baby's biological mother.

00:32:30.207 --> 00:32:31.540
And I said, that's a conclusion.

00:32:31.540 --> 00:32:32.130
That's an inference.

00:32:32.130 --> 00:32:33.060
How'd you get there?

00:32:33.060 --> 00:32:34.030
What are your observations?

00:32:34.030 --> 00:32:35.279
She said, look at their noses.

00:32:35.279 --> 00:32:37.540
They're exactly the same.

00:32:37.540 --> 00:32:38.882
I looked at their noses.

00:32:38.882 --> 00:32:40.465
This is exactly what
I said-- I happen

00:32:40.465 --> 00:32:43.590
to have information it's not
the baby's biological mother.

00:32:43.590 --> 00:32:46.120
Now in the book, I talk about
seeing versus observing.

00:32:46.120 --> 00:32:48.240
What's analogous is
hearing versus listening.

00:32:48.240 --> 00:32:49.730
We all hear, but
we don't listen.

00:32:49.730 --> 00:32:52.022
So I said, I happen to
have information it's not

00:32:52.022 --> 00:32:53.230
the baby's biological mother.

00:32:53.230 --> 00:32:55.646
And from the back of the room,
she pointed to me and said,

00:32:55.646 --> 00:32:57.480
you're a racist.

00:32:57.480 --> 00:32:59.674
And I said, you know,
we just met today.

00:32:59.674 --> 00:33:01.340
I said, you've known
me about two hours.

00:33:01.340 --> 00:33:04.050
I talk about a lot of subjects,
but I don't understand.

00:33:04.050 --> 00:33:06.369
What have I said that warrants
you calling me a racist?

00:33:06.369 --> 00:33:07.410
Hearing versus listening.

00:33:07.410 --> 00:33:09.040
She said, you just
said, that can't be

00:33:09.040 --> 00:33:10.860
the baby's biological mother.

00:33:10.860 --> 00:33:12.290
I said, I didn't
say that at all.

00:33:12.290 --> 00:33:14.240
I said, I happen to have
information it's not

00:33:14.240 --> 00:33:16.720
the baby's biological mother.

00:33:16.720 --> 00:33:17.750
I live in Manhattan.

00:33:17.750 --> 00:33:19.340
It would never come
out of my mouth

00:33:19.340 --> 00:33:20.840
that a brown-skinned
woman couldn't

00:33:20.840 --> 00:33:23.080
have a white child, because
I've seen it many times.

00:33:23.080 --> 00:33:24.660
I said, I happen
to know it's not

00:33:24.660 --> 00:33:25.660
the baby's biological mother.

00:33:25.660 --> 00:33:27.284
Because after nine
months of pregnancy,

00:33:27.284 --> 00:33:29.670
27 hours of hard labor and
a c-section scar this big,

00:33:29.670 --> 00:33:31.420
I know who the baby's mother is.

00:33:31.420 --> 00:33:32.285
It's me.

00:33:32.285 --> 00:33:34.276
It's my son.

00:33:34.276 --> 00:33:36.150
And the woman in the
picture is 52 years old.

00:33:36.150 --> 00:33:37.480
She's from Trinidad.

00:33:37.480 --> 00:33:38.860
She's the center
of my household.

00:33:38.860 --> 00:33:42.040
That child, whitest baby
you're ever going to see.

00:33:42.040 --> 00:33:44.590
There is no biological tie
between those two people.

00:33:44.590 --> 00:33:46.610
But they are combined.

00:33:46.610 --> 00:33:48.280
They are tied at the
heart and the hip.

00:33:48.280 --> 00:33:51.540
12 years later, they
are still together.

00:33:51.540 --> 00:33:54.190
Notice that he grew
up and she didn't.

00:33:54.190 --> 00:33:55.715
But you see, this
is a conversation

00:33:55.715 --> 00:33:56.590
that we need to have.

00:33:56.590 --> 00:33:59.060
We need to talk about race
and assumptions and biases

00:33:59.060 --> 00:34:01.710
and relationships based on
visual images that we see.

00:34:01.710 --> 00:34:04.060
But here's the conversation
I don't want to have,

00:34:04.060 --> 00:34:05.760
and I'm forced to
have it all the time.

00:34:05.760 --> 00:34:07.910
When I do grand
rounds in hospitals,

00:34:07.910 --> 00:34:10.325
I put this picture up and
I say, OK, what do you see?

00:34:10.325 --> 00:34:12.449
I've had the chief of
emergency medicine department

00:34:12.449 --> 00:34:14.150
at a major urban
hospital tell me

00:34:14.150 --> 00:34:16.510
that child has Down syndrome.

00:34:16.510 --> 00:34:17.540
And I say, really?

00:34:17.540 --> 00:34:18.850
What evidence of the
condition do you see?

00:34:18.850 --> 00:34:20.350
And he said, oh no,
I don't see any.

00:34:20.350 --> 00:34:21.830
I know it when I see it.

00:34:21.830 --> 00:34:23.409
I've been told my
child is an albino.

00:34:23.409 --> 00:34:25.534
But my favorite is that he
has a thyroid condition.

00:34:25.534 --> 00:34:28.530
I said, why do you think this
child has a thyroid condition?

00:34:28.530 --> 00:34:30.679
And he said, because he
has a compressed neck

00:34:30.679 --> 00:34:32.510
from multiple surgeries.

00:34:32.510 --> 00:34:34.760
I said, you know, my kid was
so fat till he was three,

00:34:34.760 --> 00:34:36.840
there was no neck.

00:34:36.840 --> 00:34:38.170
And I said, guess what?

00:34:38.170 --> 00:34:39.590
He has a neck now.

00:34:39.590 --> 00:34:41.340
How about that?

00:34:41.340 --> 00:34:43.229
So all of these
people came rushing

00:34:43.229 --> 00:34:44.770
to the podium to
apologize for saying

00:34:44.770 --> 00:34:46.550
these things about my family.

00:34:46.550 --> 00:34:48.750
And I'm going to tell
you what I said to them.

00:34:48.750 --> 00:34:50.250
I said, you put a picture
of your kid up there,

00:34:50.250 --> 00:34:51.560
you have to have a thick skin.

00:34:51.560 --> 00:34:55.389
You can say anything you want
about my kid-- almost-- I said.

00:34:55.389 --> 00:34:58.120
But don't reach for
what you want to see.

00:34:58.120 --> 00:35:00.710
Don't try to get to
a conclusion that you

00:35:00.710 --> 00:35:01.870
think you need to get to.

00:35:01.870 --> 00:35:03.910
Because the ends do
not justify the means.

00:35:03.910 --> 00:35:07.110
You are accountable for your
observations along the way.

00:35:07.110 --> 00:35:09.020
If you jump to a
conclusion, you better

00:35:09.020 --> 00:35:10.395
be able to say
how you get there.

00:35:10.395 --> 00:35:12.436
Now I'm going to give you
an exercise that I give

00:35:12.436 --> 00:35:13.770
to my FBI surveillance agents.

00:35:13.770 --> 00:35:15.375
I'd like you to find
a partner right now.

00:35:15.375 --> 00:35:16.830
It can be the person
sitting next to you,

00:35:16.830 --> 00:35:17.770
the person sitting behind you.

00:35:17.770 --> 00:35:18.980
But they need to be close by.

00:35:18.980 --> 00:35:22.000
Find a partner.

00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:23.820
Now I'm going to put a slide up.

00:35:23.820 --> 00:35:26.580
You're going to have 45 seconds.

00:35:26.580 --> 00:35:29.730
One of you in the partnership
is going to close your eyes.

00:35:29.730 --> 00:35:32.280
And the other person is
going to have 45 seconds

00:35:32.280 --> 00:35:35.922
to describe the slide that
I put up on the screen.

00:35:35.922 --> 00:35:37.380
And why am I asking
you to do this?

00:35:37.380 --> 00:35:39.840
How often does someone
say, picture this.

00:35:39.840 --> 00:35:42.260
And you're like, what
do you want me to do?

00:35:42.260 --> 00:35:44.880
So the listener is
going to have 45 seconds

00:35:44.880 --> 00:35:47.850
to form a mental image of what
is being described to them.

00:35:47.850 --> 00:35:51.820
At the end of 45 seconds,
I'm going to call time.

00:35:51.820 --> 00:35:56.080
When I call time, listeners open
their eyes, all talking ceases,

00:35:56.080 --> 00:35:57.950
and I direct my questions
to the listeners.

00:35:57.950 --> 00:35:59.486
You got it?

00:35:59.486 --> 00:36:01.110
Decide who's going
to close their eyes.

00:36:01.110 --> 00:36:03.110
Half the room,
shut your eyes now.

00:36:03.110 --> 00:36:06.660
All right, 45 seconds to
describe not this slide.

00:36:06.660 --> 00:36:07.275
Ready?

00:36:07.275 --> 00:36:07.775
Go.

00:36:07.775 --> 00:36:10.978
[AUDIENCE CHATTING]

00:36:14.370 --> 00:36:15.150
Open your eyes.

00:36:15.150 --> 00:36:16.660
Don't say another word.

00:36:16.660 --> 00:36:19.020
Listeners, look at the screen.

00:36:19.020 --> 00:36:21.950
One of these images was
being described to you.

00:36:21.950 --> 00:36:24.380
And I want you to raise your
hand when I point to the one

00:36:24.380 --> 00:36:26.480
that you think was
being described to you.

00:36:26.480 --> 00:36:28.250
There is no kicking,
pinching, or hitting

00:36:28.250 --> 00:36:30.170
on the part of the
describers when

00:36:30.170 --> 00:36:31.550
I point to the correct image.

00:36:31.550 --> 00:36:32.370
No cheating.

00:36:32.370 --> 00:36:33.640
OK?

00:36:33.640 --> 00:36:35.760
Just out of curiosity,
did any of the describers

00:36:35.760 --> 00:36:38.551
tell their partners
it's a Monet painting?

00:36:38.551 --> 00:36:39.050
Too bad.

00:36:39.050 --> 00:36:39.800
They're all Monet.

00:36:39.800 --> 00:36:41.780
That's not going to help you.

00:36:41.780 --> 00:36:42.480
All right?

00:36:42.480 --> 00:36:44.580
So listeners, how
many of you think

00:36:44.580 --> 00:36:47.270
it's the upper
left painting that

00:36:47.270 --> 00:36:48.400
was being described to you?

00:36:48.400 --> 00:36:49.210
Raise your hand.

00:36:49.210 --> 00:36:51.970
Upper left?

00:36:51.970 --> 00:36:53.541
Hands up.

00:36:53.541 --> 00:36:54.040
OK.

00:36:54.040 --> 00:36:54.925
Hands down.

00:36:54.925 --> 00:36:56.800
Who thinks it was the
painting on the bottom?

00:36:56.800 --> 00:36:59.510
Hands up.

00:36:59.510 --> 00:37:00.950
OK, hands down.

00:37:00.950 --> 00:37:02.680
And who thinks it
was upper right?

00:37:02.680 --> 00:37:04.950
Raise your hands.

00:37:04.950 --> 00:37:05.910
Good for you.

00:37:05.910 --> 00:37:08.270
Most of you got it right.

00:37:08.270 --> 00:37:16.684
Now, shout out how you knew
what your partner said,

00:37:16.684 --> 00:37:17.600
to pick the right one.

00:37:17.600 --> 00:37:18.390
What'd your partner say?

00:37:18.390 --> 00:37:19.850
AUDIENCE: She said it
was a black bridge.

00:37:19.850 --> 00:37:21.020
AMY E. HERMAN: She said
it was a black bridge.

00:37:21.020 --> 00:37:21.640
Good.

00:37:21.640 --> 00:37:22.760
What else?

00:37:22.760 --> 00:37:24.050
AUDIENCE: The red reflection.

00:37:24.050 --> 00:37:24.940
AMY E. HERMAN: Red reflection.

00:37:24.940 --> 00:37:26.960
AUDIENCE: Different colored
trees and water lilies.

00:37:26.960 --> 00:37:28.690
AMY E. HERMAN: Different
colored trees and water lilies.

00:37:28.690 --> 00:37:30.520
Those are all good
descriptions, but none

00:37:30.520 --> 00:37:32.460
are completely dispositive.

00:37:32.460 --> 00:37:33.720
Let me show you something.

00:37:33.720 --> 00:37:36.860
Each of these paintings had
bridge, foliage, lily pads,

00:37:36.860 --> 00:37:37.360
and water.

00:37:37.360 --> 00:37:39.920
You can only talk
about that for so long.

00:37:39.920 --> 00:37:43.080
I even gave you 50
seconds instead of 45.

00:37:43.080 --> 00:37:46.524
Now if any of you had been
truly observant and said,

00:37:46.524 --> 00:37:48.690
I'm looking at this slide
because my instruction was

00:37:48.690 --> 00:37:51.170
to describe the image,
not the picture, and said,

00:37:51.170 --> 00:37:53.520
there's this weird white
border on the right side

00:37:53.520 --> 00:37:59.290
in the bottom of her
slide, your game is over.

00:37:59.290 --> 00:38:01.790
Now, I know what
you're thinking.

00:38:01.790 --> 00:38:05.020
You're thinking
that's just stupid.

00:38:05.020 --> 00:38:07.320
You gave me 45 seconds to
describe this painting,

00:38:07.320 --> 00:38:10.060
why would I waste precious
few seconds to talk

00:38:10.060 --> 00:38:11.920
about a dumb white
matting on the right side

00:38:11.920 --> 00:38:13.170
in the bottom of the painting?

00:38:13.170 --> 00:38:14.130
Here's why.

00:38:14.130 --> 00:38:16.420
Because in 12 years of
doing this exercise,

00:38:16.420 --> 00:38:19.300
six pairs of people
have identified to me

00:38:19.300 --> 00:38:21.930
that they have included
the white border.

00:38:21.930 --> 00:38:24.997
Three of those six have been
United States Navy SEALs.

00:38:24.997 --> 00:38:26.580
And when I asked
them why they include

00:38:26.580 --> 00:38:28.390
the border in their
description they said,

00:38:28.390 --> 00:38:29.850
it's because we're
trained to use

00:38:29.850 --> 00:38:32.230
all the information we have.

00:38:32.230 --> 00:38:34.060
It's a matter of life and death.

00:38:34.060 --> 00:38:37.417
So my takeaway for you from
this exercise is to say,

00:38:37.417 --> 00:38:38.000
you know what?

00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:39.400
I'm going to use all
the information I have.

00:38:39.400 --> 00:38:41.282
There's always time to
get rid of it later.

00:38:41.282 --> 00:38:43.740
Because you never know when
it's going to change your game.

00:38:43.740 --> 00:38:45.198
Had you mentioned
the border, there

00:38:45.198 --> 00:38:48.559
is no question which painting
you were talking about.

00:38:48.559 --> 00:38:49.906
Blah, blah, blah.

00:38:49.906 --> 00:38:51.280
I've been talking
for 45 minutes.

00:38:51.280 --> 00:38:52.020
What are my takeaways?

00:38:52.020 --> 00:38:54.103
What do I want you to leave
this session thinking?

00:38:54.103 --> 00:38:57.650
Number one-- everything
deserves a second look.

00:38:57.650 --> 00:39:00.302
What you see the first time
isn't necessarily what's there.

00:39:00.302 --> 00:39:02.760
Think about the problems we
have with eyewitness testimony.

00:39:02.760 --> 00:39:05.160
People swear they saw
someone, and then they

00:39:05.160 --> 00:39:08.450
identify them in a lineup,
that person wasn't even there.

00:39:08.450 --> 00:39:10.790
What you're looking at is a
painting by Gerhard Richter,

00:39:10.790 --> 00:39:12.470
not a photograph.

00:39:12.470 --> 00:39:14.150
You need to look
twice at everything.

00:39:14.150 --> 00:39:16.280
Number two-- big picture
and small details

00:39:16.280 --> 00:39:17.220
are equally important.

00:39:17.220 --> 00:39:19.760
We have a barmaid here,
behind a cold white marble

00:39:19.760 --> 00:39:23.750
bar, champagne Bass Ale, is
that a mirror behind her?

00:39:23.750 --> 00:39:25.400
Is that the barmaid's backside?

00:39:25.400 --> 00:39:26.400
Is that another barmaid?

00:39:26.400 --> 00:39:27.580
Who's the client over here?

00:39:27.580 --> 00:39:29.280
That's all the big picture.

00:39:29.280 --> 00:39:30.710
But don't forget
the small detail.

00:39:30.710 --> 00:39:33.150
In the far upper-left-hand
corner of this painting

00:39:33.150 --> 00:39:35.670
is a trapeze artist's feet.

00:39:35.670 --> 00:39:37.864
Right here and right here.

00:39:37.864 --> 00:39:39.280
That's the whole
reason the people

00:39:39.280 --> 00:39:41.800
are gathered in the first
place, for entertainment.

00:39:41.800 --> 00:39:44.050
Big picture and small details
are equally important.

00:39:44.050 --> 00:39:45.800
You know what I mean
when I say, no matter

00:39:45.800 --> 00:39:49.160
how similar two situations,
two transactions, two problems,

00:39:49.160 --> 00:39:50.710
remember to say that
one's a painting

00:39:50.710 --> 00:39:51.710
and one's a photograph?

00:39:51.710 --> 00:39:54.340
Lay the groundwork before
you want to show people

00:39:54.340 --> 00:39:56.120
how smart you are.

00:39:56.120 --> 00:39:58.570
Tell people that I'm looking
at two scenes by the water.

00:39:58.570 --> 00:39:59.663
Each one has people in it.

00:39:59.663 --> 00:40:01.287
In the black-and-white
photograph above

00:40:01.287 --> 00:40:02.814
we're seeing them from the back.

00:40:02.814 --> 00:40:04.480
And in the color
painting in the bottom,

00:40:04.480 --> 00:40:07.400
we're seeing them from
angles from the side.

00:40:07.400 --> 00:40:10.100
I talk about what you see, what
you notice, what you perceive.

00:40:10.100 --> 00:40:11.790
Don't forget about
the mahogany table.

00:40:11.790 --> 00:40:12.980
What are you missing?

00:40:12.980 --> 00:40:17.920
Here's the artist, right
here and right here.

00:40:17.920 --> 00:40:19.420
His name is Liu Bolin.

00:40:19.420 --> 00:40:22.181
He takes pictures of
things, iconic things

00:40:22.181 --> 00:40:23.680
all over the world,
everyday things,

00:40:23.680 --> 00:40:26.110
and he paints himself
into his photographs.

00:40:26.110 --> 00:40:28.500
Step back from every
difficult issue and say,

00:40:28.500 --> 00:40:32.330
what might I be missing?

00:40:32.330 --> 00:40:34.480
This is brilliant.

00:40:34.480 --> 00:40:36.252
Easter Sunday of
this year in the UK,

00:40:36.252 --> 00:40:37.960
these children were
on an Easter egg hunt

00:40:37.960 --> 00:40:40.040
in a rural part of the country.

00:40:40.040 --> 00:40:43.600
Two men robbed homes and were
escaping across the same field.

00:40:43.600 --> 00:40:46.760
And the police helicopter
above was trying to chase them.

00:40:46.760 --> 00:40:49.560
The children saw what
direction they went in,

00:40:49.560 --> 00:40:52.390
and they did what I ask
every single class to do.

00:40:52.390 --> 00:40:55.340
They thought clearly
and precisely

00:40:55.340 --> 00:40:56.960
in exigent circumstances.

00:40:56.960 --> 00:40:58.440
They collaborated.

00:40:58.440 --> 00:41:01.150
And they communicated with
clarity and precision.

00:41:01.150 --> 00:41:03.960
They told the helicopter which
direction the robbers ran,

00:41:03.960 --> 00:41:05.940
and they got them.

00:41:05.940 --> 00:41:09.650
Someone said to me, are
kids in the UK just smarter?

00:41:09.650 --> 00:41:10.950
Is that it?

00:41:10.950 --> 00:41:15.070
But I thought the visual image
was incredibly compelling.

00:41:15.070 --> 00:41:17.850
A reminder to be creative
and resourceful in every job,

00:41:17.850 --> 00:41:21.600
whether you are neurosurgeon,
Navy SEAL, police officer,

00:41:21.600 --> 00:41:23.550
nurse, social worker,
library, we all

00:41:23.550 --> 00:41:25.950
need to be creative
and resourceful.

00:41:25.950 --> 00:41:27.450
After the events
of 9/11 happened,

00:41:27.450 --> 00:41:29.580
the federal government
convened the 9/11 Commission

00:41:29.580 --> 00:41:31.413
and said, how did this
happen on our watches

00:41:31.413 --> 00:41:32.509
and under our noses?

00:41:32.509 --> 00:41:34.300
And the 9/11 Commission
came back and said,

00:41:34.300 --> 00:41:36.370
the intelligence community
of the United States

00:41:36.370 --> 00:41:39.090
lacks creativity
and imagination.

00:41:39.090 --> 00:41:41.660
They couldn't envision
that those atrocities

00:41:41.660 --> 00:41:42.624
would take place.

00:41:42.624 --> 00:41:44.790
So I started working with
the intelligence community

00:41:44.790 --> 00:41:48.260
post 9/11, to try to bring
the idea of creativity

00:41:48.260 --> 00:41:51.740
in intelligence analysis
back into the fore.

00:41:51.740 --> 00:41:53.540
And I show you the
work of El Anatsui.

00:41:53.540 --> 00:41:57.440
He's a contemporary
African sculptor.

00:41:57.440 --> 00:41:59.230
And he makes these
incredible sculptures

00:41:59.230 --> 00:42:01.940
that I'm showing you, by going
to distilleries in Ghana,

00:42:01.940 --> 00:42:05.019
picking up metal bottle
caps from discarded alcohol

00:42:05.019 --> 00:42:06.060
bottles and beer bottles.

00:42:06.060 --> 00:42:07.620
He flattens them,
he hammers them,

00:42:07.620 --> 00:42:10.887
and he sews them
together to make this.

00:42:10.887 --> 00:42:12.720
The reminder to be
creative and resourceful,

00:42:12.720 --> 00:42:15.520
no matter what your profession.

00:42:15.520 --> 00:42:17.840
You need to look in the mirror
at the end of every day.

00:42:17.840 --> 00:42:19.112
You're not going to see this.

00:42:19.112 --> 00:42:20.570
But you need to
look in the mirror.

00:42:20.570 --> 00:42:23.050
Self-perception is critical
to professional growth.

00:42:23.050 --> 00:42:24.780
You need to know what you did
right, what you did wrong,

00:42:24.780 --> 00:42:26.280
how to replicate
what you did right,

00:42:26.280 --> 00:42:28.510
and how to avoid
what you did wrong.

00:42:28.510 --> 00:42:29.980
And I leave you
with my last slide,

00:42:29.980 --> 00:42:31.560
Artful Perception is my website.

00:42:31.560 --> 00:42:33.370
You can read more
about this training.

00:42:33.370 --> 00:42:35.570
You can contact me.
"Visual Intelligence"

00:42:35.570 --> 00:42:37.250
is the book that I
have just written.

00:42:37.250 --> 00:42:38.420
It was published on May 3rd.

00:42:38.420 --> 00:42:40.380
I think we're out of
copies on the table.

00:42:40.380 --> 00:42:43.080
But the book is a natural
extension and expansion

00:42:43.080 --> 00:42:44.400
of this program.

00:42:44.400 --> 00:42:46.150
But most importantly,
I wanted to give you

00:42:46.150 --> 00:42:49.140
two visual images, of looking
at the world before the Art

00:42:49.140 --> 00:42:50.745
of Perception and after.

00:42:50.745 --> 00:42:52.120
And I show you
two self-portraits

00:42:52.120 --> 00:42:53.825
of the artist, Chuck Close.

00:42:53.825 --> 00:42:55.950
For those of you who don't
know who Chuck Close is,

00:42:55.950 --> 00:42:58.200
he's a 20th and 21st
century portrait painter,

00:42:58.200 --> 00:43:00.774
world renowned, paralyzed
from the shoulders down.

00:43:00.774 --> 00:43:02.440
And he paints with a
brush in his mouth.

00:43:02.440 --> 00:43:04.920
And he has very limited
use of his hands.

00:43:04.920 --> 00:43:06.420
The self-portrait
on the left is how

00:43:06.420 --> 00:43:09.240
you saw the world before
this, a white bald man

00:43:09.240 --> 00:43:11.790
with green eyes, round
glasses and a goatee,

00:43:11.790 --> 00:43:14.270
looking right out at
you, wearing a t-shirt.

00:43:14.270 --> 00:43:16.285
Nothing wrong with seeing
the world this way.

00:43:16.285 --> 00:43:17.910
But after taking the
Art of Perception,

00:43:17.910 --> 00:43:19.730
I would prefer that
you see the world more

00:43:19.730 --> 00:43:21.090
like the self-portrait
of Close done

00:43:21.090 --> 00:43:22.390
five years later on the right.

00:43:22.390 --> 00:43:24.740
He's broken down every
quadrant of information.

00:43:24.740 --> 00:43:27.952
He's made it more colorful, more
compelling, more interesting.

00:43:27.952 --> 00:43:29.910
He's lowered his glasses
to see the big picture

00:43:29.910 --> 00:43:31.940
and not miss the small details.

00:43:31.940 --> 00:43:33.606
And I believe,
from my experience,

00:43:33.606 --> 00:43:35.230
that if you do all
the things that I've

00:43:35.230 --> 00:43:36.570
written about in the book
and that I talk about

00:43:36.570 --> 00:43:38.611
in this course, you think
about your observations

00:43:38.611 --> 00:43:41.280
and perceptions, you keep
your inferences, biases,

00:43:41.280 --> 00:43:43.810
and assumptions in check,
you're careful about your choice

00:43:43.810 --> 00:43:44.310
of words.

00:43:44.310 --> 00:43:46.520
You ask what you know,
what you don't know,

00:43:46.520 --> 00:43:48.057
and what do you need to know.

00:43:48.057 --> 00:43:49.640
If you think about
all those concepts,

00:43:49.640 --> 00:43:52.057
I think it makes you a
sharper professional, I think,

00:43:52.057 --> 00:43:53.140
a more interesting person.

00:43:53.140 --> 00:43:55.490
And I leave you with
this last anecdote.

00:43:55.490 --> 00:43:57.160
When my son was in
elementary school,

00:43:57.160 --> 00:43:58.820
we lived on the east
side of New York.

00:43:58.820 --> 00:44:00.280
And he went to school
in the West Village.

00:44:00.280 --> 00:44:01.310
So I would drop
him in the morning

00:44:01.310 --> 00:44:03.726
and try to jog home to get
some exercise because I'm never

00:44:03.726 --> 00:44:04.390
in the city.

00:44:04.390 --> 00:44:06.620
And I'm jogging
across 12th Street.

00:44:06.620 --> 00:44:08.090
And a man in a
wheelchair came out

00:44:08.090 --> 00:44:10.930
of a building with a rope
tied around his midsection.

00:44:10.930 --> 00:44:14.927
He was walking the cutest little
Labrador puppy I'd ever seen.

00:44:14.927 --> 00:44:16.260
New Yorkers are fussy, you know.

00:44:16.260 --> 00:44:18.093
You have to ask permission
to pet their dog.

00:44:18.093 --> 00:44:20.489
So I said to the man,
may I pet your dog?

00:44:20.489 --> 00:44:21.280
He said, of course.

00:44:21.280 --> 00:44:22.321
I got down on the ground.

00:44:22.321 --> 00:44:23.050
I rolled around.

00:44:23.050 --> 00:44:24.340
I had my long hair then.

00:44:24.340 --> 00:44:27.037
I got puppy kiss and
drool and fur all over me.

00:44:27.037 --> 00:44:29.370
Stood up, cleaned myself off,
thanked the man very much.

00:44:29.370 --> 00:44:31.000
He wheeled toward Sixth Avenue.

00:44:31.000 --> 00:44:33.450
And I continued towards Fifth.

00:44:33.450 --> 00:44:35.000
I looked down the street.

00:44:35.000 --> 00:44:37.510
The man in the wheelchair
was Chuck Close.

00:44:37.510 --> 00:44:39.182
I was so focused
on his puppy dog,

00:44:39.182 --> 00:44:41.390
that I didn't realize that
one of my favorite artists

00:44:41.390 --> 00:44:46.180
of all time, whose work that
I had been using for years

00:44:46.180 --> 00:44:47.729
was sitting right
in front of me.

00:44:47.729 --> 00:44:49.770
There's a whole world out
there we're not seeing.

00:44:49.770 --> 00:44:51.230
And I hope after
looking at works of art

00:44:51.230 --> 00:44:53.438
and thinking about this
program and reading the book,

00:44:53.438 --> 00:44:56.470
you'll expand your
"Visual Intelligence",

00:44:56.470 --> 00:44:58.690
bring it into your professional
and personal worlds.

00:44:58.690 --> 00:45:00.146
Thank you very
much for having me.

00:45:00.146 --> 00:45:03.428
[APPLAUSE]

00:45:07.120 --> 00:45:08.620
I'll be happy to
find books but does

00:45:08.620 --> 00:45:10.250
anybody have any questions?

00:45:10.250 --> 00:45:11.496
Yes?

00:45:11.496 --> 00:45:12.870
AUDIENCE: More of
an observation.

00:45:12.870 --> 00:45:13.250
AMY E. HERMAN: Yes?

00:45:13.250 --> 00:45:15.650
AUDIENCE: I didn't see the
cow until I gave up on it.

00:45:15.650 --> 00:45:17.310
AMY E. HERMAN: Well, that's
an interesting observation.

00:45:17.310 --> 00:45:18.060
That's a good one.

00:45:18.060 --> 00:45:19.934
AUDIENCE: Like, my head
started to turn away,

00:45:19.934 --> 00:45:20.940
and then I saw it.

00:45:20.940 --> 00:45:22.770
AMY E. HERMAN: Sometimes
we try too hard.

00:45:22.770 --> 00:45:23.960
Sometimes we try too hard.

00:45:23.960 --> 00:45:26.079
And I think if we just
take in the information,

00:45:26.079 --> 00:45:28.120
our brains take in much
more than we can possibly

00:45:28.120 --> 00:45:29.320
see at one time.

00:45:29.320 --> 00:45:32.083
And we need to think about
what it is that we're seeing.

00:45:32.083 --> 00:45:32.900
Good.

00:45:32.900 --> 00:45:35.060
Any other questions?

00:45:35.060 --> 00:45:35.600
Anything?

00:45:35.600 --> 00:45:37.183
I work for the
intelligence community.

00:45:37.183 --> 00:45:40.100
My life is an open book.

00:45:40.100 --> 00:45:41.730
AUDIENCE: So about
observing more,

00:45:41.730 --> 00:45:45.470
it seems part of the problem
is cognitive limitations,

00:45:45.470 --> 00:45:48.142
in terms of we actually can't
consciously process everything

00:45:48.142 --> 00:45:48.850
that's coming in.

00:45:48.850 --> 00:45:51.530
So how do you prioritize
what you pay attention to?

00:45:51.530 --> 00:45:52.970
AMY E. HERMAN: It's true.

00:45:52.970 --> 00:45:55.060
We're barraged with
information all the time,

00:45:55.060 --> 00:45:57.450
especially because we
have digital technology.

00:45:57.450 --> 00:46:01.250
And so what I ask people to do
is, you can't consciously say,

00:46:01.250 --> 00:46:02.800
well I'm only going
to look this way,

00:46:02.800 --> 00:46:04.440
or I'm not going to
be more observant.

00:46:04.440 --> 00:46:07.380
But I ask the readers of my
book and the participants

00:46:07.380 --> 00:46:10.680
in my class to become more aware
of their perceptual filters,

00:46:10.680 --> 00:46:14.390
to become more aware of their
biases and their assumptions,

00:46:14.390 --> 00:46:17.230
and to step back
and say, I see this.

00:46:17.230 --> 00:46:19.270
But is this really
what I'm looking at?

00:46:19.270 --> 00:46:20.030
And I practice.

00:46:20.030 --> 00:46:21.030
I live in New York City.

00:46:21.030 --> 00:46:22.635
I practice on the
subway all the time.

00:46:22.635 --> 00:46:24.934
A cop once told me, when
people get on the subway

00:46:24.934 --> 00:46:26.600
and off, you should
know who's coming in

00:46:26.600 --> 00:46:28.300
and who's getting
off at all times.

00:46:28.300 --> 00:46:31.180
Can you recite your-- I talk
about situational awareness--

00:46:31.180 --> 00:46:32.489
where are you now?

00:46:32.489 --> 00:46:33.280
How do you get out?

00:46:33.280 --> 00:46:34.113
Are you comfortable?

00:46:34.113 --> 00:46:34.930
Who's around you?

00:46:34.930 --> 00:46:37.350
And think about long-term
situational awareness.

00:46:37.350 --> 00:46:39.450
What are the problems
I'm aware of?

00:46:39.450 --> 00:46:42.850
So yes, we're never going to
master observing everything

00:46:42.850 --> 00:46:43.640
around us.

00:46:43.640 --> 00:46:45.760
But if I can get people
to step back and think

00:46:45.760 --> 00:46:48.610
about the perceptual filters
that they're operating on,

00:46:48.610 --> 00:46:50.460
and you take some of
those filters off,

00:46:50.460 --> 00:46:53.897
hopefully you'll have a
broader way to see the world.

00:46:53.897 --> 00:46:56.480
AUDIENCE: Hey, thanks for coming
and giving this awesome talk.

00:46:56.480 --> 00:46:57.521
AMY E. HERMAN: Thank you.

00:46:57.521 --> 00:46:59.809
AUDIENCE: I have a
question about perception

00:46:59.809 --> 00:47:02.100
as it relates to the development
and production of art.

00:47:02.100 --> 00:47:02.620
AMY E. HERMAN: Yes?

00:47:02.620 --> 00:47:05.050
AUDIENCE: I started taking a
bunch of realist art classes

00:47:05.050 --> 00:47:09.130
that are really intense, like
three-to-six-hour model poses

00:47:09.130 --> 00:47:10.959
where you just go
crazy into detail.

00:47:10.959 --> 00:47:12.750
And I was wondering if
you had any insights

00:47:12.750 --> 00:47:17.500
about the development of
the ability to perceive?

00:47:17.500 --> 00:47:21.330
Because I've noticed, coming
in knowing pretty much nothing,

00:47:21.330 --> 00:47:24.420
that the first couple
poses that you do,

00:47:24.420 --> 00:47:26.240
you'll draw the
head way over here

00:47:26.240 --> 00:47:28.073
because you think that's
where it should be,

00:47:28.073 --> 00:47:30.300
in your iconic
version of a person.

00:47:30.300 --> 00:47:33.102
And then it's really totally
on the other side of the page,

00:47:33.102 --> 00:47:35.310
and everything's totally
unrelated to where it really

00:47:35.310 --> 00:47:36.120
is.

00:47:36.120 --> 00:47:38.120
AMY E. HERMAN: Well, the
method for art creation

00:47:38.120 --> 00:47:39.500
is actually
analogous to thinking

00:47:39.500 --> 00:47:40.950
about strategic problems.

00:47:40.950 --> 00:47:43.630
Observation and perception
are very different things.

00:47:43.630 --> 00:47:46.390
And your observations
inform your perceptions.

00:47:46.390 --> 00:47:49.390
So while you may be in
this very intense art

00:47:49.390 --> 00:47:52.770
class for three to six hours,
drawing the heads and the hand

00:47:52.770 --> 00:47:56.792
and the torso, I encourage
you, when you step away,

00:47:56.792 --> 00:47:58.500
to think about the
image you are drawing,

00:47:58.500 --> 00:48:00.920
and your overall perception
will come in differently.

00:48:00.920 --> 00:48:02.770
Because observations
inform perceptions,

00:48:02.770 --> 00:48:04.680
and perceptions
inform inferences.

00:48:04.680 --> 00:48:06.370
You know how something comes to
you in the middle of the night?

00:48:06.370 --> 00:48:08.000
You've been working
on something,

00:48:08.000 --> 00:48:09.210
and you think about
it during the day,

00:48:09.210 --> 00:48:09.930
and you can't solve it.

00:48:09.930 --> 00:48:12.450
And in the middle of the
night, you have what you think

00:48:12.450 --> 00:48:15.170
is an incredibly
brilliant perception.

00:48:15.170 --> 00:48:16.396
I keep a notebook by the bed.

00:48:16.396 --> 00:48:18.020
And I realize when
I wake up, it really

00:48:18.020 --> 00:48:19.353
wasn't that brilliant after all.

00:48:19.353 --> 00:48:22.330
But I do scratch it out in
the middle of the night.

00:48:22.330 --> 00:48:24.760
And I think the same thing
comes with artistic creation.

00:48:24.760 --> 00:48:26.430
Your perception
of your subject is

00:48:26.430 --> 00:48:28.420
going to be separate
from your observations.

00:48:28.420 --> 00:48:30.910
So I would take the time in
class, when you have access

00:48:30.910 --> 00:48:33.642
to the model, focus totally
on your observations

00:48:33.642 --> 00:48:35.350
and let the perception
come to you later.

00:48:35.350 --> 00:48:37.360
And then go back and
revise your work of art.

00:48:37.360 --> 00:48:38.730
Same thing with a problem.

00:48:38.730 --> 00:48:39.510
Step away.

00:48:39.510 --> 00:48:41.551
And I have a method in
the book for stepping away

00:48:41.551 --> 00:48:43.840
from problems, thinking
about what's camouflaged,

00:48:43.840 --> 00:48:46.070
am I looking at more
than one thing at a time?

00:48:46.070 --> 00:48:47.280
Ask others.

00:48:47.280 --> 00:48:49.030
Separate the observations
and perceptions.

00:48:49.030 --> 00:48:51.327
And I think that's how art
works come together as well.

00:48:51.327 --> 00:48:52.160
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:48:52.160 --> 00:48:54.150
AMY E. HERMAN: You're welcome.

00:48:54.150 --> 00:48:55.930
Anything else?

00:48:55.930 --> 00:48:56.850
Yes?

00:48:56.850 --> 00:48:58.505
AUDIENCE: Since it's been
quiet, I have another question.

00:48:58.505 --> 00:48:58.940
AMY E. HERMAN: Sure.

00:48:58.940 --> 00:49:00.940
AUDIENCE: I think you're
very fortunate that you

00:49:00.940 --> 00:49:02.399
get to interact
with so many people

00:49:02.399 --> 00:49:04.731
from different fields who are
at the top of their field.

00:49:04.731 --> 00:49:05.570
AMY E. HERMAN: Yes.

00:49:05.570 --> 00:49:07.580
AUDIENCE: So what have you
found was surprising or learned

00:49:07.580 --> 00:49:08.960
from them in how
they do their work

00:49:08.960 --> 00:49:10.126
and the way that they think?

00:49:10.126 --> 00:49:12.380
Because I imagine that
doctors think very differently

00:49:12.380 --> 00:49:13.032
from CEOs.

00:49:13.032 --> 00:49:13.990
AMY E. HERMAN: They do.

00:49:13.990 --> 00:49:14.510
They do.

00:49:14.510 --> 00:49:16.865
And I really feel very
privileged to see the world

00:49:16.865 --> 00:49:19.240
through this professional lens
and meet all these people.

00:49:19.240 --> 00:49:20.670
But I'll be very
candid with you.

00:49:20.670 --> 00:49:22.200
I had a very, very
senior detective

00:49:22.200 --> 00:49:24.220
in the NYPD,
Detective [INAUDIBLE].

00:49:24.220 --> 00:49:27.480
And I noticed him coming to
my class for the third time,

00:49:27.480 --> 00:49:28.810
because I remember faces.

00:49:28.810 --> 00:49:31.479
And I said, Detective, why are
you here for the third time?

00:49:31.479 --> 00:49:33.520
And I'll share with you
his very candid response.

00:49:33.520 --> 00:49:36.460
He said, because I suck at this.

00:49:36.460 --> 00:49:39.730
And he said, I'm
really bad at this.

00:49:39.730 --> 00:49:41.130
I'm not good at listening.

00:49:41.130 --> 00:49:42.670
I'm not good at describing.

00:49:42.670 --> 00:49:44.440
I've been on the
job for 25 years,

00:49:44.440 --> 00:49:46.410
and your class made
me realize that when

00:49:46.410 --> 00:49:48.110
I get called to a
crime scene, I already

00:49:48.110 --> 00:49:50.050
have a vision in my head of what
the crime scene's going to look

00:49:50.050 --> 00:49:51.440
like before I even get there.

00:49:51.440 --> 00:49:53.520
And it's not the
way to do your job.

00:49:53.520 --> 00:49:57.012
So I find that when I
work at very high levels

00:49:57.012 --> 00:49:59.220
in the intelligence community
and in law enforcement,

00:49:59.220 --> 00:50:02.660
in medicine, we have to get over
this initial skepticism of what

00:50:02.660 --> 00:50:04.620
is this art lady
going to teach me?

00:50:04.620 --> 00:50:09.010
And what I try to get past
is I'm not one of you.

00:50:09.010 --> 00:50:10.937
I say, I'm not law enforcement.

00:50:10.937 --> 00:50:12.520
I'm not in the
intelligence community.

00:50:12.520 --> 00:50:14.180
I can't tell you
how to do your job.

00:50:14.180 --> 00:50:16.130
But I can help you do
it more effectively.

00:50:16.130 --> 00:50:19.936
And if they'll let down that
initial barrier of skepticism

00:50:19.936 --> 00:50:21.310
and realize that
the works of art

00:50:21.310 --> 00:50:24.550
that we're looking at, those
skills transfer directly

00:50:24.550 --> 00:50:27.080
over to what they're
doing, I think

00:50:27.080 --> 00:50:28.700
they make drastic improvements.

00:50:28.700 --> 00:50:31.330
And it's been applicable
at different levels.

00:50:31.330 --> 00:50:33.320
And it really is an
honor for me to work

00:50:33.320 --> 00:50:34.820
across the
professional spectrum.

00:50:34.820 --> 00:50:37.360
But I do see initial resistance.

00:50:37.360 --> 00:50:38.949
And then I see
them embracing it.

00:50:38.949 --> 00:50:39.490
Gets to them.

00:50:39.490 --> 00:50:41.406
AUDIENCE: And if I can
ask, is there something

00:50:41.406 --> 00:50:42.740
you've learned from them?

00:50:42.740 --> 00:50:44.740
AMY E. HERMAN: Oh, I've
learned a lot from them.

00:50:44.740 --> 00:50:46.235
I've learned a lot from them.

00:50:46.235 --> 00:50:47.860
Especially when I'm
working with people

00:50:47.860 --> 00:50:49.930
who do not have a
trained eye in art,

00:50:49.930 --> 00:50:51.931
they will come up with
insights and observations

00:50:51.931 --> 00:50:53.346
that I would have
never considered

00:50:53.346 --> 00:50:54.840
because I'm trained
in art history,

00:50:54.840 --> 00:50:56.894
and I'm looking at
everything contextualized.

00:50:56.894 --> 00:50:59.060
And they will show me things
that I would have never

00:50:59.060 --> 00:51:00.670
considered in a work of art.

00:51:00.670 --> 00:51:03.210
So they've broadened
my vision tremendously.

00:51:03.210 --> 00:51:05.340
And believe it or not, one
of the strangest groups

00:51:05.340 --> 00:51:07.582
I work with are
investment bankers.

00:51:07.582 --> 00:51:09.790
I couldn't figure out what
they were going to get out

00:51:09.790 --> 00:51:11.630
of this class, but they do.

00:51:11.630 --> 00:51:13.130
And because they
have to communicate

00:51:13.130 --> 00:51:14.810
across cultural
landscapes, and they

00:51:14.810 --> 00:51:16.550
see things in
works of art, as do

00:51:16.550 --> 00:51:19.554
the SEALS, that I would
never see beforehand.

00:51:19.554 --> 00:51:20.220
Thank you again.

00:51:20.220 --> 00:51:22.970
[APPLAUSE]
