00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:03.280
My name is Rishiraj Pravahan and I'm a

00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:06.140
principal data scientist at the AT&amp;T big data

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:09.480
center in Palo Alto. My background actually is

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:14.300
in high energy experimental high energy physics and

00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:19.600
I was, before here, I was at CERN for about 7 years. That's where I did my

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:25.780
PhD and post-doc for a few years. So that's sort of where I came from.

00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:31.010
And I became a data scientist almost as a natural sort of step towards

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:36.360
learning about data and dealing with big data, as you know, the LHC produce a

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:40.330
large amount of data. And we have to handle it and analyze it so

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:44.890
along the way I picked up the skills to become a data scientist, and so.
