won't be able to
 

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:24.320
won't be able to
so this talk it's gonna be really simple

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330
so this talk it's gonna be really simple
 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:25.720
so this talk it's gonna be really simple
we're gonna be talking about animation

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:25.730
we're gonna be talking about animation
 

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:33.020
we're gonna be talking about animation
user experience and brains so first

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030
user experience and brains so first
 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:34.100
user experience and brains so first
we're gonna start with a little bit of a

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110
we're gonna start with a little bit of a
 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:36.799
we're gonna start with a little bit of a
natural motion and what that means I'm

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809
natural motion and what that means I'm
 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:37.910
natural motion and what that means I'm
gonna be talking about holding users

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920
gonna be talking about holding users
 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.040
gonna be talking about holding users
focus then we're talking about framing

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050
focus then we're talking about framing
 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:43.010
focus then we're talking about framing
attention then we'll get over to

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020
attention then we'll get over to
 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:45.110
attention then we'll get over to
material motion title of this talk and

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120
material motion title of this talk and
 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:48.130
material motion title of this talk and
finally we'll finish off with some goop

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:48.140
finally we'll finish off with some goop
 

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:51.439
finally we'll finish off with some goop
so how many of you guys went to the

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449
so how many of you guys went to the
 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:54.830
so how many of you guys went to the
other material design talk here great so

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840
other material design talk here great so
 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:56.360
other material design talk here great so
now you're all experts in the mind and

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370
now you're all experts in the mind and
 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:00.319
now you're all experts in the mind and
material design right sweet this is talk

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329
material design right sweet this is talk
 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:01.939
material design right sweet this is talk
is gonna be a little bit more designing

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949
is gonna be a little bit more designing
 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:05.179
is gonna be a little bit more designing
with some Android implementation so but

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189
with some Android implementation so but
 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:06.380
with some Android implementation so but
there's still gonna be a lot of Android

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390
there's still gonna be a lot of Android
 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:09.230
there's still gonna be a lot of Android
stuff in this talk so for those of you

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240
stuff in this talk so for those of you
 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:10.700
stuff in this talk so for those of you
who don't know what material design is

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710
who don't know what material design is
 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:12.830
who don't know what material design is
though I'm gonna explain it in three

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840
though I'm gonna explain it in three
 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.770
though I'm gonna explain it in three
cards first thing is material design is

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780
cards first thing is material design is
 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:17.780
cards first thing is material design is
material so views look as if they're

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790
material so views look as if they're
 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:19.280
material so views look as if they're
made out of something real and natural

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290
made out of something real and natural
 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:24.230
made out of something real and natural
right so a paper or plastic or gel the

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240
right so a paper or plastic or gel the
 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:25.910
right so a paper or plastic or gel the
views then respond in the way that that

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920
views then respond in the way that that
 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:27.350
views then respond in the way that that
material would respond right so you

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360
material would respond right so you
 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:30.080
material would respond right so you
don't expect a piece of plastic to fold

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090
don't expect a piece of plastic to fold
 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.870
don't expect a piece of plastic to fold
over on itself so why would the view if

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880
over on itself so why would the view if
 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:33.800
over on itself so why would the view if
it's made out of plastic

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810
it's made out of plastic
 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:36.499
it's made out of plastic
respondent uh fellow would fold over on

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509
respondent uh fellow would fold over on
 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:40.910
respondent uh fellow would fold over on
itself and animation views animate in

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920
itself and animation views animate in
 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:42.560
itself and animation views animate in
meaningful ways and guide the user

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570
meaningful ways and guide the user
 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:46.460
meaningful ways and guide the user
through the app so Google kind of gives

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470
through the app so Google kind of gives
 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:48.499
through the app so Google kind of gives
us some nice little guidelines on this

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509
us some nice little guidelines on this
 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:51.499
us some nice little guidelines on this
right so for material they kind of give

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509
right so for material they kind of give
 

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:53.030
right so for material they kind of give
it this nice animation right so things

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040
it this nice animation right so things
 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:55.100
it this nice animation right so things
kind of morph into one another you can

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110
kind of morph into one another you can
 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:57.560
kind of morph into one another you can
kind of sense what material you'll the

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570
kind of sense what material you'll the
 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:01.280
kind of sense what material you'll the
view is made out of something by how it

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290
view is made out of something by how it
 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:02.959
view is made out of something by how it
looks and then you can also kind of get

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:02.969
looks and then you can also kind of get
 

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:05.510
looks and then you can also kind of get
a feel for how that material behaves

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520
a feel for how that material behaves
 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.160
a feel for how that material behaves
based on the interaction with it right

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170
based on the interaction with it right
 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:08.990
based on the interaction with it right
so in this case we kind of got a slip of

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000
so in this case we kind of got a slip of
 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.160
so in this case we kind of got a slip of
paper and it's getting picked up off the

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170
paper and it's getting picked up off the
 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:12.350
paper and it's getting picked up off the
page and moved around right and it feels

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.360
page and moved around right and it feels
 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:13.820
page and moved around right and it feels
natural it feels like a piece of paper

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830
natural it feels like a piece of paper
 

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:15.650
natural it feels like a piece of paper
should behave and finally we have

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:15.660
should behave and finally we have
 

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:18.680
should behave and finally we have
animations and google tells us that

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:18.690
animations and google tells us that
 

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:20.450
animations and google tells us that
animations should be meaningful and

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:20.460
animations should be meaningful and
 

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:24.140
animations should be meaningful and
guiding but what does that actually mean

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:24.150
guiding but what does that actually mean
 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:26.450
guiding but what does that actually mean
what is meaningful and guiding actually

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:26.460
what is meaningful and guiding actually
 

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:31.280
what is meaningful and guiding actually
entail for your app well the first thing

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:31.290
entail for your app well the first thing
 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:34.100
entail for your app well the first thing
is it's got to respond to the user right

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:34.110
is it's got to respond to the user right
 

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:36.440
is it's got to respond to the user right
if the user doesn't tap on a view then

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:36.450
if the user doesn't tap on a view then
 

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:37.790
if the user doesn't tap on a view then
it's not meaningful why did it animate

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:37.800
it's not meaningful why did it animate
 

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:39.950
it's not meaningful why did it animate
right why did the why did your animation

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:39.960
right why did the why did your animation
 

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:42.170
right why did the why did your animation
kick off before the user interacted with

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:42.180
kick off before the user interacted with
 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:44.720
kick off before the user interacted with
it the second thing is in order to

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:44.730
it the second thing is in order to
 

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:47.030
it the second thing is in order to
actually be meaningful it has to guide

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:47.040
actually be meaningful it has to guide
 

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:49.070
actually be meaningful it has to guide
the users focus your animation has to

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:49.080
the users focus your animation has to
 

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:50.420
the users focus your animation has to
have a purpose then it has to serve that

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:50.430
have a purpose then it has to serve that
 

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:52.160
have a purpose then it has to serve that
purpose and that purpose is always gonna

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:52.170
purpose and that purpose is always gonna
 

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:55.040
purpose and that purpose is always gonna
be to guide the users focus and finally

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:55.050
be to guide the users focus and finally
 

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:57.020
be to guide the users focus and finally
while you're guiding the users focus

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:57.030
while you're guiding the users focus
 

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:59.270
while you're guiding the users focus
you're going to be creating new context

00:02:59.270 --> 00:02:59.280
you're going to be creating new context
 

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:01.820
you're going to be creating new context
for your animation you guide them to

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:01.830
for your animation you guide them to
 

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:03.130
for your animation you guide them to
what they're supposed to look at and

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:03.140
what they're supposed to look at and
 

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:05.540
what they're supposed to look at and
your users kind of understand what

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:05.550
your users kind of understand what
 

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:06.650
your users kind of understand what
they're supposed to look at and they get

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:06.660
they're supposed to look at and they get
 

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:09.160
they're supposed to look at and they get
this new context based off that

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:09.170
this new context based off that
 

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:13.520
this new context based off that
animation that you played for them so

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:13.530
animation that you played for them so
 

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:15.050
animation that you played for them so
let's talk a little bit about natural

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:15.060
let's talk a little bit about natural
 

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:17.360
let's talk a little bit about natural
motion so what is natural motion what is

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:17.370
motion so what is natural motion what is
 

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:20.270
motion so what is natural motion what is
unnatural motion and why do we care

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:20.280
unnatural motion and why do we care
 

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:22.520
unnatural motion and why do we care
right so natural motion keeps motion

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:22.530
right so natural motion keeps motion
 

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:25.190
right so natural motion keeps motion
believable right things animate on the

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:25.200
believable right things animate on the
 

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:27.860
believable right things animate on the
screen in a realistic way right so in

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:27.870
screen in a realistic way right so in
 

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:29.720
screen in a realistic way right so in
order to do that we kind of have to

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:29.730
order to do that we kind of have to
 

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:32.180
order to do that we kind of have to
calculate right where an object should

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:32.190
calculate right where an object should
 

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:35.479
calculate right where an object should
be in the animation given the time right

00:03:35.479 --> 00:03:35.489
be in the animation given the time right
 

00:03:35.489 --> 00:03:38.030
be in the animation given the time right
because time flows linearly but your

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:38.040
because time flows linearly but your
 

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:40.100
because time flows linearly but your
animation might not so we need to

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:40.110
animation might not so we need to
 

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:42.199
animation might not so we need to
interpolate it and that's what motion

00:03:42.199 --> 00:03:42.209
interpolate it and that's what motion
 

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:45.800
interpolate it and that's what motion
interpolation is so give it a formula we

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:45.810
interpolation is so give it a formula we
 

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:48.020
interpolation is so give it a formula we
animate our time or whether we interpret

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:48.030
animate our time or whether we interpret
 

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:49.910
animate our time or whether we interpret
our time into a set of values that we're

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:49.920
our time into a set of values that we're
 

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:51.640
our time into a set of values that we're
then going to use to play our animation

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:51.650
then going to use to play our animation
 

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:54.530
then going to use to play our animation
so there's a couple of ways to

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:54.540
so there's a couple of ways to
 

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:56.810
so there's a couple of ways to
interpolate motion and I'm kind of going

00:03:56.810 --> 00:03:56.820
interpolate motion and I'm kind of going
 

00:03:56.820 --> 00:03:59.150
interpolate motion and I'm kind of going
to go over four of them real quick to

00:03:59.150 --> 00:03:59.160
to go over four of them real quick to
 

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:01.400
to go over four of them real quick to
give you guys an idea of the basics that

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:01.410
give you guys an idea of the basics that
 

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:02.960
give you guys an idea of the basics that
you guys need to know in order to make

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:02.970
you guys need to know in order to make
 

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:05.180
you guys need to know in order to make
your animations natural unbelievable the

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:05.190
your animations natural unbelievable the
 

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:07.160
your animations natural unbelievable the
first is linear animation and quite

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:07.170
first is linear animation and quite
 

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:08.900
first is linear animation and quite
simply linear animation just means that

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:08.910
simply linear animation just means that
 

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:12.949
simply linear animation just means that
one time flows your objects move

00:04:12.949 --> 00:04:12.959
one time flows your objects move
 

00:04:12.959 --> 00:04:15.710
one time flows your objects move
linearly right so as our time increases

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:15.720
linearly right so as our time increases
 

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:20.240
linearly right so as our time increases
our object moves just with that time we

00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:20.250
our object moves just with that time we
 

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:21.760
our object moves just with that time we
can also do what's called easing in and

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:21.770
can also do what's called easing in and
 

00:04:21.770 --> 00:04:25.960
can also do what's called easing in and
as our animation moves forward our

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:25.970
as our animation moves forward our
 

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:28.330
as our animation moves forward our
animation will actually Excel

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:28.340
animation will actually Excel
 

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:30.800
animation will actually Excel
so here's kind of an example of that so

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:30.810
so here's kind of an example of that so
 

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:33.380
so here's kind of an example of that so
by the time it reaches the end it sped

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:33.390
by the time it reaches the end it sped
 

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:36.710
by the time it reaches the end it sped
up a little bit we also have the

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:36.720
up a little bit we also have the
 

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:38.860
up a little bit we also have the
opposite of that which is our animation

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:38.870
opposite of that which is our animation
 

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:43.460
opposite of that which is our animation
decelerates while it's moving so it

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:43.470
decelerates while it's moving so it
 

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:45.290
decelerates while it's moving so it
starts off really fast and kind of slows

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:45.300
starts off really fast and kind of slows
 

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:49.130
starts off really fast and kind of slows
down towards the end and finally you can

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:49.140
down towards the end and finally you can
 

00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:52.400
down towards the end and finally you can
combine those two and you can ease in

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:52.410
combine those two and you can ease in
 

00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:54.020
combine those two and you can ease in
and then ease out right so your

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:54.030
and then ease out right so your
 

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:55.940
and then ease out right so your
animation starts off slowly speeds up

00:04:55.940 --> 00:04:55.950
animation starts off slowly speeds up
 

00:04:55.950 --> 00:04:59.510
animation starts off slowly speeds up
and then slows back down so watch that

00:04:59.510 --> 00:04:59.520
and then slows back down so watch that
 

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:04.909
and then slows back down so watch that
blue dot spit up and slow it down so why

00:05:04.909 --> 00:05:04.919
blue dot spit up and slow it down so why
 

00:05:04.919 --> 00:05:07.310
blue dot spit up and slow it down so why
do we care about any of these things so

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:07.320
do we care about any of these things so
 

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:08.840
do we care about any of these things so
in order to keep your motion believable

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:08.850
in order to keep your motion believable
 

00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:09.920
in order to keep your motion believable
you kind of have to apply these

00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:09.930
you kind of have to apply these
 

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:11.510
you kind of have to apply these
interpolations in a way that makes

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:11.520
interpolations in a way that makes
 

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:12.200
interpolations in a way that makes
unbelievable

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:12.210
unbelievable
 

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:14.510
unbelievable
so the first one is easing in and the

00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:14.520
so the first one is easing in and the
 

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:15.680
so the first one is easing in and the
reason that you would use an ease in

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:15.690
reason that you would use an ease in
 

00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:18.680
reason that you would use an ease in
animation interpolator is for objects

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:18.690
animation interpolator is for objects
 

00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:20.420
animation interpolator is for objects
that are leaving the space your object

00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:20.430
that are leaving the space your object
 

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:24.380
that are leaving the space your object
is stay still on the screen then it

00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:24.390
is stay still on the screen then it
 

00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:26.090
is stay still on the screen then it
starts speeding up leaves a space

00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:26.100
starts speeding up leaves a space
 

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:28.490
starts speeding up leaves a space
because it's sped up and it's going off

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:28.500
because it's sped up and it's going off
 

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:30.650
because it's sped up and it's going off
the screen and the reason that you want

00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:30.660
the screen and the reason that you want
 

00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:32.270
the screen and the reason that you want
to do this is because it's actually more

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:32.280
to do this is because it's actually more
 

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:34.490
to do this is because it's actually more
natural object speed up as they're

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:34.500
natural object speed up as they're
 

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:36.500
natural object speed up as they're
leaving the space your user has the time

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:36.510
leaving the space your user has the time
 

00:05:36.510 --> 00:05:38.150
leaving the space your user has the time
to notice that object is moving but by

00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:38.160
to notice that object is moving but by
 

00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:39.320
to notice that object is moving but by
the time it's actually left to space

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:39.330
the time it's actually left to space
 

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:40.909
the time it's actually left to space
it's sped up fast enough that the user

00:05:40.909 --> 00:05:40.919
it's sped up fast enough that the user
 

00:05:40.919 --> 00:05:42.740
it's sped up fast enough that the user
knows that they shouldn't care the user

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:42.750
knows that they shouldn't care the user
 

00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:44.450
knows that they shouldn't care the user
can kind of predict that that object is

00:05:44.450 --> 00:05:44.460
can kind of predict that that object is
 

00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:46.520
can kind of predict that that object is
going to leave the space similar thing

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:46.530
going to leave the space similar thing
 

00:05:46.530 --> 00:05:48.110
going to leave the space similar thing
for easing out or rather the opposite

00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:48.120
for easing out or rather the opposite
 

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:49.790
for easing out or rather the opposite
thing for easing out your objects are

00:05:49.790 --> 00:05:49.800
thing for easing out your objects are
 

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:52.580
thing for easing out your objects are
entering the space so as your objects

00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:52.590
entering the space so as your objects
 

00:05:52.590 --> 00:05:54.290
entering the space so as your objects
are entering the space you want them to

00:05:54.290 --> 00:05:54.300
are entering the space you want them to
 

00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:56.090
are entering the space you want them to
slow down user will have a little bit

00:05:56.090 --> 00:05:56.100
slow down user will have a little bit
 

00:05:56.100 --> 00:05:57.469
slow down user will have a little bit
more time to figure out where that

00:05:57.469 --> 00:05:57.479
more time to figure out where that
 

00:05:57.479 --> 00:06:00.710
more time to figure out where that
object is in a end up easing both is for

00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:00.720
object is in a end up easing both is for
 

00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:03.170
object is in a end up easing both is for
when your object is moving within the

00:06:03.170 --> 00:06:03.180
when your object is moving within the
 

00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:05.030
when your object is moving within the
space right so if your object is gonna

00:06:05.030 --> 00:06:05.040
space right so if your object is gonna
 

00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:06.800
space right so if your object is gonna
be moving across the screen you want to

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:06.810
be moving across the screen you want to
 

00:06:06.810 --> 00:06:08.390
be moving across the screen you want to
speed it up or you want to start off

00:06:08.390 --> 00:06:08.400
speed it up or you want to start off
 

00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:09.980
speed it up or you want to start off
slow you want to speed it up while it's

00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:09.990
slow you want to speed it up while it's
 

00:06:09.990 --> 00:06:11.980
slow you want to speed it up while it's
actually in motion and then you want to

00:06:11.980 --> 00:06:11.990
actually in motion and then you want to
 

00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:15.890
actually in motion and then you want to
put it where it ends up and finally we

00:06:15.890 --> 00:06:15.900
put it where it ends up and finally we
 

00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:20.780
put it where it ends up and finally we
have linear don't use this it's super

00:06:20.780 --> 00:06:20.790
have linear don't use this it's super
 

00:06:20.790 --> 00:06:23.840
have linear don't use this it's super
unnatural it's super robotic this is

00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:23.850
unnatural it's super robotic this is
 

00:06:23.850 --> 00:06:25.370
unnatural it's super robotic this is
what unnatural motion is unnatural

00:06:25.370 --> 00:06:25.380
what unnatural motion is unnatural
 

00:06:25.380 --> 00:06:27.560
what unnatural motion is unnatural
motion is linear motion if you want to

00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:27.570
motion is linear motion if you want to
 

00:06:27.570 --> 00:06:29.540
motion is linear motion if you want to
keep your motion natural use one of

00:06:29.540 --> 00:06:29.550
keep your motion natural use one of
 

00:06:29.550 --> 00:06:32.030
keep your motion natural use one of
those other three depending on what your

00:06:32.030 --> 00:06:32.040
those other three depending on what your
 

00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:33.580
those other three depending on what your
animation needs

00:06:33.580 --> 00:06:33.590
animation needs
 

00:06:33.590 --> 00:06:36.320
animation needs
however I will qualify this by saying

00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:36.330
however I will qualify this by saying
 

00:06:36.330 --> 00:06:38.570
however I will qualify this by saying
that an object in motion stays in motion

00:06:38.570 --> 00:06:38.580
that an object in motion stays in motion
 

00:06:38.580 --> 00:06:41.060
that an object in motion stays in motion
and that part is natural so if your

00:06:41.060 --> 00:06:41.070
and that part is natural so if your
 

00:06:41.070 --> 00:06:41.610
and that part is natural so if your
object is

00:06:41.610 --> 00:06:41.620
object is
 

00:06:41.620 --> 00:06:43.290
object is
flinging across the screen flying

00:06:43.290 --> 00:06:43.300
flinging across the screen flying
 

00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:45.000
flinging across the screen flying
through your application or in general

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:45.010
through your application or in general
 

00:06:45.010 --> 00:06:46.439
through your application or in general
just coming on the screen and then

00:06:46.439 --> 00:06:46.449
just coming on the screen and then
 

00:06:46.449 --> 00:06:47.280
just coming on the screen and then
leaving immediately

00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:47.290
leaving immediately
 

00:06:47.290 --> 00:06:49.379
leaving immediately
go ahead and make it linear that's fine

00:06:49.379 --> 00:06:49.389
go ahead and make it linear that's fine
 

00:06:49.389 --> 00:06:50.939
go ahead and make it linear that's fine
your object shouldn't be slowing down if

00:06:50.939 --> 00:06:50.949
your object shouldn't be slowing down if
 

00:06:50.949 --> 00:06:52.800
your object shouldn't be slowing down if
it's not stopping on the screen or if it

00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:52.810
it's not stopping on the screen or if it
 

00:06:52.810 --> 00:06:57.060
it's not stopping on the screen or if it
didn't start from a standing position so

00:06:57.060 --> 00:06:57.070
didn't start from a standing position so
 

00:06:57.070 --> 00:06:58.170
didn't start from a standing position so
how do you do this in android

00:06:58.170 --> 00:06:58.180
how do you do this in android
 

00:06:58.180 --> 00:07:01.770
how do you do this in android
turns out it's ridiculously simple we

00:07:01.770 --> 00:07:01.780
turns out it's ridiculously simple we
 

00:07:01.780 --> 00:07:03.320
turns out it's ridiculously simple we
have these things called time

00:07:03.320 --> 00:07:03.330
have these things called time
 

00:07:03.330 --> 00:07:06.120
have these things called time
interpolators and Google has built them

00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:06.130
interpolators and Google has built them
 

00:07:06.130 --> 00:07:08.129
interpolators and Google has built them
all for you you don't need to do any of

00:07:08.129 --> 00:07:08.139
all for you you don't need to do any of
 

00:07:08.139 --> 00:07:10.590
all for you you don't need to do any of
this ease in is just an accelerate

00:07:10.590 --> 00:07:10.600
this ease in is just an accelerate
 

00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:12.210
this ease in is just an accelerate
interpolator because that's all it does

00:07:12.210 --> 00:07:12.220
interpolator because that's all it does
 

00:07:12.220 --> 00:07:15.420
interpolator because that's all it does
it just accelerates the object ease out

00:07:15.420 --> 00:07:15.430
it just accelerates the object ease out
 

00:07:15.430 --> 00:07:17.850
it just accelerates the object ease out
decelerate interpolator and then when

00:07:17.850 --> 00:07:17.860
decelerate interpolator and then when
 

00:07:17.860 --> 00:07:19.980
decelerate interpolator and then when
you want to use both accelerate

00:07:19.980 --> 00:07:19.990
you want to use both accelerate
 

00:07:19.990 --> 00:07:21.990
you want to use both accelerate
decelerate interpolator just how you

00:07:21.990 --> 00:07:22.000
decelerate interpolator just how you
 

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:24.390
decelerate interpolator just how you
would expect and when you're animating

00:07:24.390 --> 00:07:24.400
would expect and when you're animating
 

00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:26.159
would expect and when you're animating
the view right so how do we actually

00:07:26.159 --> 00:07:26.169
the view right so how do we actually
 

00:07:26.169 --> 00:07:28.620
the view right so how do we actually
animate a view well we grab the view

00:07:28.620 --> 00:07:28.630
animate a view well we grab the view
 

00:07:28.630 --> 00:07:32.360
animate a view well we grab the view
from our ID we call animate on it we do

00:07:32.360 --> 00:07:32.370
from our ID we call animate on it we do
 

00:07:32.370 --> 00:07:34.950
from our ID we call animate on it we do
whatever animations you want translation

00:07:34.950 --> 00:07:34.960
whatever animations you want translation
 

00:07:34.960 --> 00:07:37.290
whatever animations you want translation
X translation Y translation Z you can

00:07:37.290 --> 00:07:37.300
X translation Y translation Z you can
 

00:07:37.300 --> 00:07:39.120
X translation Y translation Z you can
use that for this and you just call set

00:07:39.120 --> 00:07:39.130
use that for this and you just call set
 

00:07:39.130 --> 00:07:42.210
use that for this and you just call set
interpolator and just pass in a new

00:07:42.210 --> 00:07:42.220
interpolator and just pass in a new
 

00:07:42.220 --> 00:07:44.250
interpolator and just pass in a new
animation interpolator if you want to

00:07:44.250 --> 00:07:44.260
animation interpolator if you want to
 

00:07:44.260 --> 00:07:46.290
animation interpolator if you want to
have these what's it called

00:07:46.290 --> 00:07:46.300
have these what's it called
 

00:07:46.300 --> 00:07:49.050
have these what's it called
static in your app that might work but

00:07:49.050 --> 00:07:49.060
static in your app that might work but
 

00:07:49.060 --> 00:07:51.420
static in your app that might work but
you just pass that in and hit start and

00:07:51.420 --> 00:07:51.430
you just pass that in and hit start and
 

00:07:51.430 --> 00:07:53.490
you just pass that in and hit start and
boom that's it your animation place it's

00:07:53.490 --> 00:07:53.500
boom that's it your animation place it's
 

00:07:53.500 --> 00:07:58.589
boom that's it your animation place it's
really that simple all right now I want

00:07:58.589 --> 00:07:58.599
really that simple all right now I want
 

00:07:58.599 --> 00:08:00.210
really that simple all right now I want
to talk to you guys a little bit about

00:08:00.210 --> 00:08:00.220
to talk to you guys a little bit about
 

00:08:00.220 --> 00:08:03.839
to talk to you guys a little bit about
evil and talk to you guys about the

00:08:03.839 --> 00:08:03.849
evil and talk to you guys about the
 

00:08:03.849 --> 00:08:07.409
evil and talk to you guys about the
square root of all evil I want to talk

00:08:07.409 --> 00:08:07.419
square root of all evil I want to talk
 

00:08:07.419 --> 00:08:11.900
square root of all evil I want to talk
to you guys about premature optimization

00:08:11.900 --> 00:08:11.910
to you guys about premature optimization
 

00:08:11.910 --> 00:08:15.469
to you guys about premature optimization
so what is premature optimization

00:08:15.469 --> 00:08:15.479
so what is premature optimization
 

00:08:15.479 --> 00:08:19.260
so what is premature optimization
premature optimization is when you take

00:08:19.260 --> 00:08:19.270
premature optimization is when you take
 

00:08:19.270 --> 00:08:21.360
premature optimization is when you take
a thing that you think is going to be

00:08:21.360 --> 00:08:21.370
a thing that you think is going to be
 

00:08:21.370 --> 00:08:23.670
a thing that you think is going to be
slow but you don't know it's already

00:08:23.670 --> 00:08:23.680
slow but you don't know it's already
 

00:08:23.680 --> 00:08:26.400
slow but you don't know it's already
slow you just think it and then you go

00:08:26.400 --> 00:08:26.410
slow you just think it and then you go
 

00:08:26.410 --> 00:08:28.710
slow you just think it and then you go
ahead and you make it fast

00:08:28.710 --> 00:08:28.720
ahead and you make it fast
 

00:08:28.720 --> 00:08:30.240
ahead and you make it fast
without ever knowing whether or not it's

00:08:30.240 --> 00:08:30.250
without ever knowing whether or not it's
 

00:08:30.250 --> 00:08:34.230
without ever knowing whether or not it's
actually slow so for example if you were

00:08:34.230 --> 00:08:34.240
actually slow so for example if you were
 

00:08:34.240 --> 00:08:37.409
actually slow so for example if you were
to build out your app and you had a spot

00:08:37.409 --> 00:08:37.419
to build out your app and you had a spot
 

00:08:37.419 --> 00:08:39.000
to build out your app and you had a spot
on your app that you know you were

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:39.010
on your app that you know you were
 

00:08:39.010 --> 00:08:40.079
on your app that you know you were
sitting there and you were like hey you

00:08:40.079 --> 00:08:40.089
sitting there and you were like hey you
 

00:08:40.089 --> 00:08:41.339
sitting there and you were like hey you
know what really makes sense of this

00:08:41.339 --> 00:08:41.349
know what really makes sense of this
 

00:08:41.349 --> 00:08:46.170
know what really makes sense of this

00:09:09.660 --> 00:09:09.670
and that's all because you did some

fix something you don't know is slow

00:09:34.610 --> 00:09:34.620
fix something you don't know is slow

fix something you don't know is slow
find out what's slowing your app and

00:09:36.600 --> 00:09:36.610
find out what's slowing your app and
 

00:09:36.610 --> 00:09:42.120
find out what's slowing your app and
then fix it so with that what's the

00:09:42.120 --> 00:09:42.130
then fix it so with that what's the
 

00:09:42.130 --> 00:09:44.370
then fix it so with that what's the
slowest thing in your app call it

00:09:44.370 --> 00:09:44.380
slowest thing in your app call it
 

00:09:44.380 --> 00:09:46.189

because you're wrong there is a slowest
 

00:09:55.209 --> 00:09:56.910
because you're wrong there is a slowest
thing in your app the slowest thing in

00:09:56.910 --> 00:09:56.920
thing in your app the slowest thing in
 

00:09:56.920 --> 00:10:03.540
thing in your app the slowest thing in
your app is your user your CPU operates

00:10:03.540 --> 00:10:03.550
your app is your user your CPU operates
 

00:10:03.550 --> 00:10:05.850
your app is your user your CPU operates
on the order of milliseconds your user

00:10:05.850 --> 00:10:05.860
on the order of milliseconds your user

that they decide to click on the button
 

00:10:10.569 --> 00:10:12.660
that they decide to click on the button
and the signal from their brain goes to

00:10:12.660 --> 00:10:12.670
and the signal from their brain goes to
 

00:10:12.670 --> 00:10:14.189

that's how slow your users are your user

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:18.010

the first one is colors and shapes
 

00:10:54.910 --> 00:10:57.240
the first one is colors and shapes
colors and shapes you recognize really

00:10:57.240 --> 00:10:57.250
colors and shapes you recognize really
 

00:10:57.250 --> 00:10:58.770
colors and shapes you recognize really
really fast if you've got a bunch of

alright cool so now that we know what

00:12:25.140 --> 00:12:25.150
alright cool so now that we know what
 

00:12:25.150 --> 00:12:27.120
alright cool so now that we know what
are the fast pathways in our brain how

00:12:27.120 --> 00:12:27.130
are the fast pathways in our brain how
 

00:12:27.130 --> 00:12:29.130
are the fast pathways in our brain how
can we abuse them in order to create

00:12:29.130 --> 00:12:29.140
can we abuse them in order to create
 

00:12:29.140 --> 00:12:30.960
can we abuse them in order to create
animations that are going to be more

00:12:30.960 --> 00:12:30.970
animations that are going to be more

well we create animations that are

00:12:34.200 --> 00:12:34.210
well we create animations that are
 

00:12:34.210 --> 00:12:38.420
well we create animations that are
guiding so we have this super awesome

00:12:38.420 --> 00:12:38.430
guiding so we have this super awesome
 

00:12:38.430 --> 00:12:40.170

right that Instagram logo just pops

00:12:43.260 --> 00:12:43.270
right that Instagram logo just pops
 

00:12:43.270 --> 00:12:44.310
right that Instagram logo just pops
right up to that top

00:12:44.310 --> 00:12:44.320
right up to that top

as soon as you click it why would you do

00:12:46.020 --> 00:12:46.030
as soon as you click it why would you do
 

00:12:46.030 --> 00:12:47.580
as soon as you click it why would you do
that why would Google go through the

00:12:47.580 --> 00:12:47.590
that why would Google go through the
 

00:12:47.590 --> 00:12:49.230
that why would Google go through the
effort to make that animation

00:12:49.230 --> 00:12:49.240
effort to make that animation
 

00:12:49.240 --> 00:12:51.630
effort to make that animation
well it's because your that animation

00:12:51.630 --> 00:12:51.640
well it's because your that animation
 

00:12:51.640 --> 00:12:53.670
well it's because your that animation
guides your eye right there to that

00:12:53.670 --> 00:12:53.680
guides your eye right there to that
 

00:12:53.680 --> 00:12:56.850

point in where the arrow is right well

00:12:56.850 --> 00:12:56.860
point in where the arrow is right well
 

00:12:56.860 --> 00:12:58.380
point in where the arrow is right well
guess what that's right in line with the

00:12:58.380 --> 00:12:58.390
guess what that's right in line with the
 

00:12:58.390 --> 00:13:00.420
guess what that's right in line with the
install button and because they put that

00:13:00.420 --> 00:13:00.430
install button and because they put that
 

00:13:00.430 --> 00:13:02.070
install button and because they put that
little divider line right there your

00:13:02.070 --> 00:13:02.080
little divider line right there your
 

00:13:02.080 --> 00:13:04.320
little divider line right there your
brain groups out together your I already

00:13:04.320 --> 00:13:04.330
brain groups out together your I already
 

00:13:04.330 --> 00:13:06.030
brain groups out together your I already
lands exactly where Google wants you to

00:13:06.030 --> 00:13:06.040
lands exactly where Google wants you to
 

00:13:06.040 --> 00:13:08.480
lands exactly where Google wants you to
be which is next to that install button

00:13:08.480 --> 00:13:08.490
be which is next to that install button
 

00:13:08.490 --> 00:13:10.680
be which is next to that install button
they can actually probably improve this

00:13:10.680 --> 00:13:10.690
they can actually probably improve this
 

00:13:10.690 --> 00:13:12.060
they can actually probably improve this
further by moving the install button on

00:13:12.060 --> 00:13:12.070
further by moving the install button on
 

00:13:12.070 --> 00:13:13.230
further by moving the install button on
the other side of the screen and then

00:13:13.230 --> 00:13:13.240
the other side of the screen and then
 

00:13:13.240 --> 00:13:15.030
the other side of the screen and then
your install button is right underneath

00:13:15.030 --> 00:13:15.040
your install button is right underneath
 

00:13:15.040 --> 00:13:19.610
your install button is right underneath
your logo that they animate it to so

00:13:19.610 --> 00:13:19.620
 
 

00:13:19.620 --> 00:13:23.810
 
that provides context to the user right

00:13:23.810 --> 00:13:23.820
that provides context to the user right
 

00:13:23.820 --> 00:13:27.210
that provides context to the user right
but there's something else that we can

00:13:27.210 --> 00:13:27.220
but there's something else that we can
 

00:13:27.220 --> 00:13:29.700
but there's something else that we can
do and that's that motion attracts

00:13:29.700 --> 00:13:29.710
do and that's that motion attracts
 

00:13:29.710 --> 00:13:31.260
do and that's that motion attracts
attention right so remember what I said

00:13:31.260 --> 00:13:31.270
attention right so remember what I said
 

00:13:31.270 --> 00:13:33.090
attention right so remember what I said
about peripheral vision well whenever

00:13:33.090 --> 00:13:33.100
about peripheral vision well whenever
 

00:13:33.100 --> 00:13:35.010
about peripheral vision well whenever
something moves on the screen your brain

00:13:35.010 --> 00:13:35.020
something moves on the screen your brain
 

00:13:35.020 --> 00:13:38.070
something moves on the screen your brain
kind of snaps to it right and that way

00:13:38.070 --> 00:13:38.080
kind of snaps to it right and that way
 

00:13:38.080 --> 00:13:42.950
kind of snaps to it right and that way
your user is very similar to a t-rex

00:13:42.950 --> 00:13:42.960
your user is very similar to a t-rex
 

00:13:42.960 --> 00:13:45.120
your user is very similar to a t-rex
because both of their visions are based

00:13:45.120 --> 00:13:45.130
because both of their visions are based
 

00:13:45.130 --> 00:13:47.580
because both of their visions are based
on motion but there's an alternative to

00:13:47.580 --> 00:13:47.590
on motion but there's an alternative to
 

00:13:47.590 --> 00:13:51.750
on motion but there's an alternative to
this don't move anything that you don't

00:13:51.750 --> 00:13:51.760
this don't move anything that you don't
 

00:13:51.760 --> 00:13:54.090
this don't move anything that you don't
want to attract attention to right you

00:13:54.090 --> 00:13:54.100
want to attract attention to right you
 

00:13:54.100 --> 00:13:55.200
want to attract attention to right you
don't want to attract the attention of

00:13:55.200 --> 00:13:55.210
don't want to attract the attention of
 

00:13:55.210 --> 00:13:56.970
don't want to attract the attention of
that dinosaur in the same way that you

00:13:56.970 --> 00:13:56.980
that dinosaur in the same way that you
 

00:13:56.980 --> 00:13:58.230
that dinosaur in the same way that you
don't want to attract to that attention

00:13:58.230 --> 00:13:58.240
don't want to attract to that attention
 

00:13:58.240 --> 00:13:59.340
don't want to attract to that attention
of that user you don't want to attract

00:13:59.340 --> 00:13:59.350
of that user you don't want to attract
 

00:13:59.350 --> 00:14:00.720
of that user you don't want to attract
attention to anything that you don't

00:14:00.720 --> 00:14:00.730
attention to anything that you don't
 

00:14:00.730 --> 00:14:03.240
attention to anything that you don't
want people paying attention to so don't

00:14:03.240 --> 00:14:03.250
want people paying attention to so don't
 

00:14:03.250 --> 00:14:05.340
want people paying attention to so don't
move it right don't move stuff across

00:14:05.340 --> 00:14:05.350
move it right don't move stuff across
 

00:14:05.350 --> 00:14:07.560
move it right don't move stuff across
the screen if it's not the core focus of

00:14:07.560 --> 00:14:07.570
the screen if it's not the core focus of
 

00:14:07.570 --> 00:14:10.850
the screen if it's not the core focus of
your application or of that screen and

00:14:10.850 --> 00:14:10.860
your application or of that screen and
 

00:14:10.860 --> 00:14:14.490
your application or of that screen and
then also don't move more than one

00:14:14.490 --> 00:14:14.500
then also don't move more than one
 

00:14:14.500 --> 00:14:16.620
then also don't move more than one
element at a time like this is really

00:14:16.620 --> 00:14:16.630
element at a time like this is really
 

00:14:16.630 --> 00:14:18.840
element at a time like this is really
important there all should only be one

00:14:18.840 --> 00:14:18.850
important there all should only be one
 

00:14:18.850 --> 00:14:21.240
important there all should only be one
thing moving on the screen at a time so

00:14:21.240 --> 00:14:21.250
thing moving on the screen at a time so
 

00:14:21.250 --> 00:14:22.470
thing moving on the screen at a time so
let's take this animation that we had

00:14:22.470 --> 00:14:22.480
let's take this animation that we had
 

00:14:22.480 --> 00:14:24.240
let's take this animation that we had
kind of in the beginning of a talk and

00:14:24.240 --> 00:14:24.250
kind of in the beginning of a talk and
 

00:14:24.250 --> 00:14:25.890
kind of in the beginning of a talk and
this is a really complicated animation

00:14:25.890 --> 00:14:25.900
this is a really complicated animation
 

00:14:25.900 --> 00:14:28.350
this is a really complicated animation
that we have but it still follows that

00:14:28.350 --> 00:14:28.360
that we have but it still follows that
 

00:14:28.360 --> 00:14:30.300
that we have but it still follows that
principle of not moving more than one

00:14:30.300 --> 00:14:30.310
principle of not moving more than one
 

00:14:30.310 --> 00:14:30.780
principle of not moving more than one
thing at a time

00:14:30.780 --> 00:14:30.790
thing at a time
 

00:14:30.790 --> 00:14:31.980
thing at a time
even though there's a bunch of

00:14:31.980 --> 00:14:31.990
even though there's a bunch of
 

00:14:31.990 --> 00:14:34.590
even though there's a bunch of
moving on the screen so first of all

00:14:34.590 --> 00:14:34.600
moving on the screen so first of all
 

00:14:34.600 --> 00:14:36.450
moving on the screen so first of all
notice that those tail bubbles they fade

00:14:36.450 --> 00:14:36.460
notice that those tail bubbles they fade
 

00:14:36.460 --> 00:14:38.990
notice that those tail bubbles they fade
they don't move they just fade away

00:14:38.990 --> 00:14:39.000
they don't move they just fade away
 

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:41.910
they don't move they just fade away
that one bubble moves and then expands

00:14:41.910 --> 00:14:41.920
that one bubble moves and then expands
 

00:14:41.920 --> 00:14:45.180
that one bubble moves and then expands
out but then those orange blocks they

00:14:45.180 --> 00:14:45.190
out but then those orange blocks they
 

00:14:45.190 --> 00:14:46.980
out but then those orange blocks they
still move one at a time by the time one

00:14:46.980 --> 00:14:46.990
still move one at a time by the time one
 

00:14:46.990 --> 00:14:48.270
still move one at a time by the time one
of those orange blocks finishes moving

00:14:48.270 --> 00:14:48.280
of those orange blocks finishes moving
 

00:14:48.280 --> 00:14:49.560
of those orange blocks finishes moving
that's when the next one starts and

00:14:49.560 --> 00:14:49.570
that's when the next one starts and
 

00:14:49.570 --> 00:14:51.690
that's when the next one starts and
they're also fading in so even though

00:14:51.690 --> 00:14:51.700
they're also fading in so even though
 

00:14:51.700 --> 00:14:53.040
they're also fading in so even though
we've got a lot of motion on the screen

00:14:53.040 --> 00:14:53.050
we've got a lot of motion on the screen
 

00:14:53.050 --> 00:14:54.540
we've got a lot of motion on the screen
we're still only moving one thing at a

00:14:54.540 --> 00:14:54.550
we're still only moving one thing at a
 

00:14:54.550 --> 00:14:56.340
we're still only moving one thing at a
time which means your user knows what to

00:14:56.340 --> 00:14:56.350
time which means your user knows what to
 

00:14:56.350 --> 00:14:57.690
time which means your user knows what to
focus on because they're going to focus

00:14:57.690 --> 00:14:57.700
focus on because they're going to focus
 

00:14:57.700 --> 00:14:58.120
focus on because they're going to focus
on that

00:14:58.120 --> 00:14:58.130
on that
 

00:14:58.130 --> 00:14:59.560
on that
that's moving that's the thing that's

00:14:59.560 --> 00:14:59.570
that's moving that's the thing that's
 

00:14:59.570 --> 00:15:06.480
that's moving that's the thing that's
going to attract attention all right

00:15:06.480 --> 00:15:06.490
going to attract attention all right
 

00:15:06.490 --> 00:15:11.500
going to attract attention all right
so motion attracts attention more motion

00:15:11.500 --> 00:15:11.510
so motion attracts attention more motion
 

00:15:11.510 --> 00:15:15.480
so motion attracts attention more motion
it attracts less attention subtle motion

00:15:15.480 --> 00:15:15.490
it attracts less attention subtle motion
 

00:15:15.490 --> 00:15:19.810
it attracts less attention subtle motion
attract less attention so if we don't

00:15:19.810 --> 00:15:19.820
attract less attention so if we don't
 

00:15:19.820 --> 00:15:20.590
attract less attention so if we don't
want to attract something

00:15:20.590 --> 00:15:20.600
want to attract something
 

00:15:20.600 --> 00:15:22.720
want to attract something
attention to the screen but we still

00:15:22.720 --> 00:15:22.730
attention to the screen but we still
 

00:15:22.730 --> 00:15:24.610
attention to the screen but we still
want to move something on the screen how

00:15:24.610 --> 00:15:24.620
want to move something on the screen how
 

00:15:24.620 --> 00:15:29.290
want to move something on the screen how
do we do it well we do it subtly so why

00:15:29.290 --> 00:15:29.300
do we do it well we do it subtly so why
 

00:15:29.300 --> 00:15:31.090
do we do it well we do it subtly so why
do we actually need subtlety right so

00:15:31.090 --> 00:15:31.100
do we actually need subtlety right so
 

00:15:31.100 --> 00:15:33.220
do we actually need subtlety right so

on the screen in the case of linear
 

00:19:39.260 --> 00:19:41.380
on the screen in the case of linear
animation or linear layout this actually

animation or linear layout this actually
 

00:19:41.390 --> 00:19:43.480
animation or linear layout this actually
works phenomenally well use this

00:19:43.480 --> 00:19:43.490
works phenomenally well use this
 

00:19:43.490 --> 00:19:45.370
works phenomenally well use this
everywhere if you just need an animation

00:19:45.370 --> 00:19:45.380
everywhere if you just need an animation
 

00:19:45.380 --> 00:19:48.700
everywhere if you just need an animation
that plays slap that line in there boom

00:19:48.700 --> 00:19:48.710
that plays slap that line in there boom

that plays slap that line in there boom
you're done now what if you want to do

00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:52.010
you're done now what if you want to do
 

00:19:52.010 --> 00:19:53.310
you're done now what if you want to do
something a little bit more complicated

00:19:53.310 --> 00:19:53.320
something a little bit more complicated
 

00:19:53.320 --> 00:19:56.169
something a little bit more complicated
well you can start doing some manual

00:19:56.169 --> 00:19:56.179
well you can start doing some manual
 

00:19:56.179 --> 00:19:57.340
well you can start doing some manual
stuff so let's talk a little bit about

00:19:57.340 --> 00:19:57.350
stuff so let's talk a little bit about
 

00:19:57.350 --> 00:19:59.529
stuff so let's talk a little bit about
fading you can all animate the object

00:19:59.529 --> 00:19:59.539
fading you can all animate the object
 

00:19:59.539 --> 00:20:01.380
fading you can all animate the object
alpha and this is actually really easy

00:20:01.380 --> 00:20:01.390
alpha and this is actually really easy
 

00:20:01.390 --> 00:20:04.000
alpha and this is actually really easy
right you just take the view dot animate

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:04.010
right you just take the view dot animate
 

00:20:04.010 --> 00:20:06.519
right you just take the view dot animate
alpha if it's visible then you want to

00:20:06.519 --> 00:20:06.529
alpha if it's visible then you want to
 

00:20:06.529 --> 00:20:08.940
alpha if it's visible then you want to
yeah if it visible you want to set it to

00:20:08.940 --> 00:20:08.950
yeah if it visible you want to set it to
 

00:20:08.950 --> 00:20:11.740
yeah if it visible you want to set it to
one and then if it's invisible you want

00:20:11.740 --> 00:20:11.750
one and then if it's invisible you want
 

00:20:11.750 --> 00:20:15.639
one and then if it's invisible you want
to set it to zero oh and don't forget

00:20:15.639 --> 00:20:15.649
to set it to zero oh and don't forget
 

00:20:15.649 --> 00:20:18.490
to set it to zero oh and don't forget
the interpolator because you want this

00:20:18.490 --> 00:20:18.500
the interpolator because you want this
 

00:20:18.500 --> 00:20:20.019
the interpolator because you want this
to still be natural even though we're

00:20:20.019 --> 00:20:20.029
to still be natural even though we're
 

00:20:20.029 --> 00:20:22.149
to still be natural even though we're
animating colors here we can still

00:20:22.149 --> 00:20:22.159
animating colors here we can still
 

00:20:22.159 --> 00:20:23.649
animating colors here we can still
animate them naturally linear animation

00:20:23.649 --> 00:20:23.659
animate them naturally linear animation
 

00:20:23.659 --> 00:20:26.560
animate them naturally linear animation
or sorry linear fades still look worse

00:20:26.560 --> 00:20:26.570
or sorry linear fades still look worse
 

00:20:26.570 --> 00:20:29.980
or sorry linear fades still look worse
than interpolated fade so how does this

00:20:29.980 --> 00:20:29.990
than interpolated fade so how does this
 

00:20:29.990 --> 00:20:34.299
than interpolated fade so how does this
look right here's button fade in and out

00:20:34.299 --> 00:20:34.309
look right here's button fade in and out
 

00:20:34.309 --> 00:20:39.850
look right here's button fade in and out
right again one line of code color

00:20:39.850 --> 00:20:39.860
right again one line of code color
 

00:20:39.860 --> 00:20:41.680
right again one line of code color
changing let's say you wanted to change

00:20:41.680 --> 00:20:41.690
changing let's say you wanted to change
 

00:20:41.690 --> 00:20:44.590
changing let's say you wanted to change
colors in your app right say a button

00:20:44.590 --> 00:20:44.600
colors in your app right say a button
 

00:20:44.600 --> 00:20:48.190
colors in your app right say a button
needs to go from say gray to blue say

00:20:48.190 --> 00:20:48.200
needs to go from say gray to blue say
 

00:20:48.200 --> 00:20:49.600
needs to go from say gray to blue say
for example if you're enabling that

00:20:49.600 --> 00:20:49.610
for example if you're enabling that
 

00:20:49.610 --> 00:20:53.169
for example if you're enabling that
button well turns up we have this great

00:20:53.169 --> 00:20:53.179
button well turns up we have this great
 

00:20:53.179 --> 00:20:55.330
button well turns up we have this great
thing called object animator and we can

00:20:55.330 --> 00:20:55.340
thing called object animator and we can
 

00:20:55.340 --> 00:20:59.909
thing called object animator and we can
call object animator of RGB we give it a

00:20:59.909 --> 00:20:59.919
call object animator of RGB we give it a
 

00:20:59.919 --> 00:21:02.440
call object animator of RGB we give it a
what's a call we give it a bitmap or in

00:21:02.440 --> 00:21:02.450
what's a call we give it a bitmap or in
 

00:21:02.450 --> 00:21:05.080
what's a call we give it a bitmap or in
our case drawable and we tell it what

00:21:05.080 --> 00:21:05.090
our case drawable and we tell it what
 

00:21:05.090 --> 00:21:08.320
our case drawable and we tell it what
property to animate in this case we're

00:21:08.320 --> 00:21:08.330
property to animate in this case we're
 

00:21:08.330 --> 00:21:10.779
property to animate in this case we're
animating the tint and then we give it a

00:21:10.779 --> 00:21:10.789
animating the tint and then we give it a
 

00:21:10.789 --> 00:21:12.279
animating the tint and then we give it a
background color or our current color

00:21:12.279 --> 00:21:12.289
background color or our current color
 

00:21:12.289 --> 00:21:15.580
background color or our current color
the fade color set the interpolator

00:21:15.580 --> 00:21:15.590
the fade color set the interpolator
 

00:21:15.590 --> 00:21:17.640
the fade color set the interpolator
and then we hit start and that's it

00:21:17.640 --> 00:21:17.650
and then we hit start and that's it
 

00:21:17.650 --> 00:21:20.200
and then we hit start and that's it
there is one caveat to this this is the

00:21:20.200 --> 00:21:20.210
there is one caveat to this this is the
 

00:21:20.210 --> 00:21:23.289
there is one caveat to this this is the
API 21 but that's not a big deal you can

00:21:23.289 --> 00:21:23.299
API 21 but that's not a big deal you can
 

00:21:23.299 --> 00:21:25.060
API 21 but that's not a big deal you can
do the exact same thing an API 16 and

00:21:25.060 --> 00:21:25.070
do the exact same thing an API 16 and
 

00:21:25.070 --> 00:21:26.740
do the exact same thing an API 16 and
above all you have to do is instead of

00:21:26.740 --> 00:21:26.750
above all you have to do is instead of
 

00:21:26.750 --> 00:21:29.380
above all you have to do is instead of
passing in instead of saying Ave RGB

00:21:29.380 --> 00:21:29.390
passing in instead of saying Ave RGB
 

00:21:29.390 --> 00:21:31.120
passing in instead of saying Ave RGB
you just got to give it a new a RGB

00:21:31.120 --> 00:21:31.130
you just got to give it a new a RGB
 

00:21:31.130 --> 00:21:34.180
you just got to give it a new a RGB
evaluator so that's just API 21 just has

00:21:34.180 --> 00:21:34.190
evaluator so that's just API 21 just has
 

00:21:34.190 --> 00:21:36.810
evaluator so that's just API 21 just has
something as a syntactic sugar for that

00:21:36.810 --> 00:21:36.820
something as a syntactic sugar for that
 

00:21:36.820 --> 00:21:42.190
something as a syntactic sugar for that
but yeah otherwise Oh also perf matters

00:21:42.190 --> 00:21:42.200
but yeah otherwise Oh also perf matters
 

00:21:42.200 --> 00:21:44.769
but yeah otherwise Oh also perf matters
don't use set background color use tint

00:21:44.769 --> 00:21:44.779
don't use set background color use tint
 

00:21:44.779 --> 00:21:45.730
don't use set background color use tint
if you're actually trying to set the

00:21:45.730 --> 00:21:45.740
if you're actually trying to set the
 

00:21:45.740 --> 00:21:47.680
if you're actually trying to set the
background color with this tint animates

00:21:47.680 --> 00:21:47.690
background color with this tint animates
 

00:21:47.690 --> 00:21:49.510
background color with this tint animates
on the GPU so that's a GPU animation and

00:21:49.510 --> 00:21:49.520
on the GPU so that's a GPU animation and
 

00:21:49.520 --> 00:21:51.159
on the GPU so that's a GPU animation and
set background color is going to reset

00:21:51.159 --> 00:21:51.169
set background color is going to reset
 

00:21:51.169 --> 00:21:54.460
set background color is going to reset
and invalidate your your drawable so

00:21:54.460 --> 00:21:54.470
and invalidate your your drawable so
 

00:21:54.470 --> 00:21:55.389
and invalidate your your drawable so
that's going to be a lot slower than

00:21:55.389 --> 00:21:55.399
that's going to be a lot slower than
 

00:21:55.399 --> 00:21:57.159
that's going to be a lot slower than
just setting the tint and if you're

00:21:57.159 --> 00:21:57.169
just setting the tint and if you're
 

00:21:57.169 --> 00:21:59.860
just setting the tint and if you're
animating that matters you want your

00:21:59.860 --> 00:21:59.870
animating that matters you want your
 

00:21:59.870 --> 00:22:03.789
animating that matters you want your
animation is playing at 60fps so here's

00:22:03.789 --> 00:22:03.799
animation is playing at 60fps so here's
 

00:22:03.799 --> 00:22:04.389
animation is playing at 60fps so here's
what that looks like

00:22:04.389 --> 00:22:04.399
what that looks like
 

00:22:04.399 --> 00:22:06.519
what that looks like
right have that button we click it

00:22:06.519 --> 00:22:06.529
right have that button we click it
 

00:22:06.529 --> 00:22:07.990
right have that button we click it
change its color everything goes it back

00:22:07.990 --> 00:22:08.000
change its color everything goes it back
 

00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:08.380
change its color everything goes it back
to normal

00:22:08.380 --> 00:22:08.390
to normal
 

00:22:08.390 --> 00:22:12.340
to normal
great animated vector drawables all

00:22:12.340 --> 00:22:12.350
great animated vector drawables all
 

00:22:12.350 --> 00:22:18.279
great animated vector drawables all
right bear with me here these are these

00:22:18.279 --> 00:22:18.289
right bear with me here these are these
 

00:22:18.289 --> 00:22:23.250
right bear with me here these are these
are complicated but they look fantastic

00:22:23.250 --> 00:22:23.260
are complicated but they look fantastic
 

00:22:23.260 --> 00:22:27.940
are complicated but they look fantastic
so also they're API 21 you guys can go

00:22:27.940 --> 00:22:27.950
so also they're API 21 you guys can go
 

00:22:27.950 --> 00:22:29.799
so also they're API 21 you guys can go
bug Colton chat and ask them when

00:22:29.799 --> 00:22:29.809
bug Colton chat and ask them when
 

00:22:29.809 --> 00:22:30.850
bug Colton chat and ask them when
they're finally going to drop this into

00:22:30.850 --> 00:22:30.860
they're finally going to drop this into
 

00:22:30.860 --> 00:22:33.970
they're finally going to drop this into
the support library how do you do an

00:22:33.970 --> 00:22:33.980
the support library how do you do an
 

00:22:33.980 --> 00:22:35.680
the support library how do you do an
animated vector drawable first thing

00:22:35.680 --> 00:22:35.690
animated vector drawable first thing
 

00:22:35.690 --> 00:22:36.909
animated vector drawable first thing
that you have to do is you have to

00:22:36.909 --> 00:22:36.919
that you have to do is you have to
 

00:22:36.919 --> 00:22:38.740
that you have to do is you have to
declare a vector drawable you give it

00:22:38.740 --> 00:22:38.750
declare a vector drawable you give it
 

00:22:38.750 --> 00:22:40.269
declare a vector drawable you give it
your height your width same way that you

00:22:40.269 --> 00:22:40.279
your height your width same way that you
 

00:22:40.279 --> 00:22:41.860
your height your width same way that you
would any vector drawable then you also

00:22:41.860 --> 00:22:41.870
would any vector drawable then you also
 

00:22:41.870 --> 00:22:43.389
would any vector drawable then you also
have to define your viewport width and

00:22:43.389 --> 00:22:43.399
have to define your viewport width and
 

00:22:43.399 --> 00:22:44.680
have to define your viewport width and
your viewport height that's actually

00:22:44.680 --> 00:22:44.690
your viewport height that's actually
 

00:22:44.690 --> 00:22:46.120
your viewport height that's actually
going to depend on the data that you're

00:22:46.120 --> 00:22:46.130
going to depend on the data that you're
 

00:22:46.130 --> 00:22:48.430
going to depend on the data that you're
gonna pass into this vector drawable so

00:22:48.430 --> 00:22:48.440
gonna pass into this vector drawable so
 

00:22:48.440 --> 00:22:49.870
gonna pass into this vector drawable so
in our case this vector is going to have

00:22:49.870 --> 00:22:49.880
in our case this vector is going to have
 

00:22:49.880 --> 00:22:51.639
in our case this vector is going to have
a path and that path is just gonna have

00:22:51.639 --> 00:22:51.649
a path and that path is just gonna have
 

00:22:51.649 --> 00:22:53.470
a path and that path is just gonna have
1 it's going to have its name it's gonna

00:22:53.470 --> 00:22:53.480
1 it's going to have its name it's gonna
 

00:22:53.480 --> 00:22:55.060
1 it's going to have its name it's gonna
have its fill color and it's gonna have

00:22:55.060 --> 00:22:55.070
have its fill color and it's gonna have
 

00:22:55.070 --> 00:22:56.919
have its fill color and it's gonna have
its path data in this case it's string

00:22:56.919 --> 00:22:56.929
its path data in this case it's string
 

00:22:56.929 --> 00:22:58.870
its path data in this case it's string
slash circle what is string slash circle

00:22:58.870 --> 00:22:58.880
slash circle what is string slash circle
 

00:22:58.880 --> 00:23:01.240
slash circle what is string slash circle
string slash circle is this giant SVG

00:23:01.240 --> 00:23:01.250
string slash circle is this giant SVG
 

00:23:01.250 --> 00:23:03.519
string slash circle is this giant SVG
file well in our case it's not actually

00:23:03.519 --> 00:23:03.529
file well in our case it's not actually
 

00:23:03.529 --> 00:23:05.950
file well in our case it's not actually
very big but you can get these pretty

00:23:05.950 --> 00:23:05.960
very big but you can get these pretty
 

00:23:05.960 --> 00:23:09.180
very big but you can get these pretty
large so in our case is just an SVG file

00:23:09.180 --> 00:23:09.190
large so in our case is just an SVG file
 

00:23:09.190 --> 00:23:13.590
large so in our case is just an SVG file
so yep there it is there's that circle

00:23:13.590 --> 00:23:13.600
so yep there it is there's that circle
 

00:23:13.600 --> 00:23:17.080
so yep there it is there's that circle
and again the viewport width depends on

00:23:17.080 --> 00:23:17.090
and again the viewport width depends on
 

00:23:17.090 --> 00:23:20.889
and again the viewport width depends on
that string so you gotta ask your

00:23:20.889 --> 00:23:20.899
that string so you gotta ask your
 

00:23:20.899 --> 00:23:22.870
that string so you gotta ask your
designers if you have any what the

00:23:22.870 --> 00:23:22.880
designers if you have any what the
 

00:23:22.880 --> 00:23:24.970
designers if you have any what the
viewport height is and what the the

00:23:24.970 --> 00:23:24.980
viewport height is and what the the
 

00:23:24.980 --> 00:23:26.950
viewport height is and what the the
basis of all the numbers are because

00:23:26.950 --> 00:23:26.960
basis of all the numbers are because
 

00:23:26.960 --> 00:23:27.810
basis of all the numbers are because
it's all relative

00:23:27.810 --> 00:23:27.820
it's all relative
 

00:23:27.820 --> 00:23:29.080
it's all relative
so then we

00:23:29.080 --> 00:23:29.090
so then we
 

00:23:29.090 --> 00:23:30.940
so then we
find the animator vector right we got

00:23:30.940 --> 00:23:30.950
find the animator vector right we got
 

00:23:30.950 --> 00:23:32.980
find the animator vector right we got
our vector drawable we can define it as

00:23:32.980 --> 00:23:32.990
our vector drawable we can define it as
 

00:23:32.990 --> 00:23:35.110
our vector drawable we can define it as
an animation we tell the Android which

00:23:35.110 --> 00:23:35.120
an animation we tell the Android which
 

00:23:35.120 --> 00:23:38.380
an animation we tell the Android which
drawable to use well use my vector we

00:23:38.380 --> 00:23:38.390
drawable to use well use my vector we
 

00:23:38.390 --> 00:23:41.710
drawable to use well use my vector we
tell it what the path it's animating is

00:23:41.710 --> 00:23:41.720
tell it what the path it's animating is
 

00:23:41.720 --> 00:23:42.760
tell it what the path it's animating is
called well in this case it's

00:23:42.760 --> 00:23:42.770
called well in this case it's
 

00:23:42.770 --> 00:23:45.880
called well in this case it's
compression and then we tell it the

00:23:45.880 --> 00:23:45.890
compression and then we tell it the
 

00:23:45.890 --> 00:23:47.800
compression and then we tell it the
actual animation which is path morph

00:23:47.800 --> 00:23:47.810
actual animation which is path morph
 

00:23:47.810 --> 00:23:49.270
actual animation which is path morph
what is path morph path more if this

00:23:49.270 --> 00:23:49.280
what is path morph path more if this
 

00:23:49.280 --> 00:23:51.460
what is path morph path more if this
here right so this is just a standard

00:23:51.460 --> 00:23:51.470
here right so this is just a standard
 

00:23:51.470 --> 00:23:53.880
here right so this is just a standard
animation set we give an object animator

00:23:53.880 --> 00:23:53.890
animation set we give an object animator
 

00:23:53.890 --> 00:23:58.240
animation set we give an object animator
we pass in the value from and to so in

00:23:58.240 --> 00:23:58.250
we pass in the value from and to so in
 

00:23:58.250 --> 00:24:00.760
we pass in the value from and to so in
our case the two value is string slash

00:24:00.760 --> 00:24:00.770
our case the two value is string slash
 

00:24:00.770 --> 00:24:04.030
our case the two value is string slash
compressed and then in this specific

00:24:04.030 --> 00:24:04.040
compressed and then in this specific
 

00:24:04.040 --> 00:24:05.530
compressed and then in this specific
example we actually go backwards after

00:24:05.530 --> 00:24:05.540
example we actually go backwards after
 

00:24:05.540 --> 00:24:08.080
example we actually go backwards after
that so you pass in the duration and

00:24:08.080 --> 00:24:08.090
that so you pass in the duration and
 

00:24:08.090 --> 00:24:10.210
that so you pass in the duration and
this what this will actually do is it'll

00:24:10.210 --> 00:24:10.220
this what this will actually do is it'll
 

00:24:10.220 --> 00:24:12.430
this what this will actually do is it'll
play those two animators sequentially

00:24:12.430 --> 00:24:12.440
play those two animators sequentially
 

00:24:12.440 --> 00:24:14.650
play those two animators sequentially
and that's because we set the order to

00:24:14.650 --> 00:24:14.660
and that's because we set the order to
 

00:24:14.660 --> 00:24:17.230
and that's because we set the order to
be sequential and then we also set the

00:24:17.230 --> 00:24:17.240
be sequential and then we also set the
 

00:24:17.240 --> 00:24:20.350
be sequential and then we also set the
interpolator in this case it's the

00:24:20.350 --> 00:24:20.360
interpolator in this case it's the
 

00:24:20.360 --> 00:24:24.810
interpolator in this case it's the
decelerate interpolator but cool so

00:24:24.810 --> 00:24:24.820
decelerate interpolator but cool so
 

00:24:24.820 --> 00:24:28.030
decelerate interpolator but cool so
right that goes to that what our

00:24:28.030 --> 00:24:28.040
right that goes to that what our
 

00:24:28.040 --> 00:24:30.010
right that goes to that what our
animator drawables vector drawables look

00:24:30.010 --> 00:24:30.020
animator drawables vector drawables look
 

00:24:30.020 --> 00:24:32.320
animator drawables vector drawables look
like well remember that animation that

00:24:32.320 --> 00:24:32.330
like well remember that animation that
 

00:24:32.330 --> 00:24:35.380
like well remember that animation that
we had earlier with the back button that

00:24:35.380 --> 00:24:35.390
we had earlier with the back button that
 

00:24:35.390 --> 00:24:37.600
we had earlier with the back button that
is actually an animated vector drawable

00:24:37.600 --> 00:24:37.610
is actually an animated vector drawable
 

00:24:37.610 --> 00:24:39.900
is actually an animated vector drawable
right so they have three lines there and

00:24:39.900 --> 00:24:39.910
right so they have three lines there and
 

00:24:39.910 --> 00:24:42.190
right so they have three lines there and
in one case they have three lines and a

00:24:42.190 --> 00:24:42.200
in one case they have three lines and a
 

00:24:42.200 --> 00:24:43.360
in one case they have three lines and a
certain formation and then they have

00:24:43.360 --> 00:24:43.370
certain formation and then they have
 

00:24:43.370 --> 00:24:44.920
certain formation and then they have
another vector drawable with the three

00:24:44.920 --> 00:24:44.930
another vector drawable with the three
 

00:24:44.930 --> 00:24:46.150
another vector drawable with the three
lines and a different formation and that

00:24:46.150 --> 00:24:46.160
lines and a different formation and that
 

00:24:46.160 --> 00:24:47.800
lines and a different formation and that
formation is the back arrow and then all

00:24:47.800 --> 00:24:47.810
formation is the back arrow and then all
 

00:24:47.810 --> 00:24:49.000
formation is the back arrow and then all
they do is they interpolate between the

00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:49.010
they do is they interpolate between the
 

00:24:49.010 --> 00:24:51.070
they do is they interpolate between the
two Google handles all that for you all

00:24:51.070 --> 00:24:51.080
two Google handles all that for you all
 

00:24:51.080 --> 00:24:53.050
two Google handles all that for you all
the complicated SVG transformation logic

00:24:53.050 --> 00:24:53.060
the complicated SVG transformation logic
 

00:24:53.060 --> 00:24:54.490
the complicated SVG transformation logic
that's all done for you you don't have

00:24:54.490 --> 00:24:54.500
that's all done for you you don't have
 

00:24:54.500 --> 00:24:56.050
that's all done for you you don't have
to worry about it you just create your

00:24:56.050 --> 00:24:56.060
to worry about it you just create your
 

00:24:56.060 --> 00:24:58.300
to worry about it you just create your
animated vector drawable and then the

00:24:58.300 --> 00:24:58.310
animated vector drawable and then the
 

00:24:58.310 --> 00:24:59.740
animated vector drawable and then the
example that I actually rolled well

00:24:59.740 --> 00:24:59.750
example that I actually rolled well
 

00:24:59.750 --> 00:25:01.150
example that I actually rolled well
that's what that looks like it's just a

00:25:01.150 --> 00:25:01.160
that's what that looks like it's just a
 

00:25:01.160 --> 00:25:02.710
that's what that looks like it's just a
circle it kind of gets squeezed together

00:25:02.710 --> 00:25:02.720
circle it kind of gets squeezed together
 

00:25:02.720 --> 00:25:04.990
circle it kind of gets squeezed together
or rather it's stretched out and then it

00:25:04.990 --> 00:25:05.000
or rather it's stretched out and then it
 

00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:10.260
or rather it's stretched out and then it
goes back to where it was so alright so

00:25:10.260 --> 00:25:10.270
goes back to where it was so alright so
 

00:25:10.270 --> 00:25:12.850
goes back to where it was so alright so
we've talked a lot about motion we've

00:25:12.850 --> 00:25:12.860
we've talked a lot about motion we've
 

00:25:12.860 --> 00:25:15.460
we've talked a lot about motion we've
talked a lot about animations let's put

00:25:15.460 --> 00:25:15.470
talked a lot about animations let's put
 

00:25:15.470 --> 00:25:16.420
talked a lot about animations let's put
everything that we've kind of learned

00:25:16.420 --> 00:25:16.430
everything that we've kind of learned
 

00:25:16.430 --> 00:25:19.480
everything that we've kind of learned
together so we've got our natural

00:25:19.480 --> 00:25:19.490
together so we've got our natural
 

00:25:19.490 --> 00:25:21.940
together so we've got our natural
movement right accelerators decelerators

00:25:21.940 --> 00:25:21.950
movement right accelerators decelerators
 

00:25:21.950 --> 00:25:25.060
movement right accelerators decelerators
interpolators and then we figured out

00:25:25.060 --> 00:25:25.070
interpolators and then we figured out
 

00:25:25.070 --> 00:25:27.930
interpolators and then we figured out
how to use that guide to guide our users

00:25:27.930 --> 00:25:27.940
how to use that guide to guide our users
 

00:25:27.940 --> 00:25:31.620
how to use that guide to guide our users
well if we combine those two together

00:25:31.620 --> 00:25:31.630
well if we combine those two together
 

00:25:31.630 --> 00:25:34.660
well if we combine those two together
well you actually end up with is fluid

00:25:34.660 --> 00:25:34.670
well you actually end up with is fluid
 

00:25:34.670 --> 00:25:40.750
well you actually end up with is fluid
motion so what is actually fluid motion

00:25:40.750 --> 00:25:40.760
motion so what is actually fluid motion
 

00:25:40.760 --> 00:25:42.610
motion so what is actually fluid motion
well fluid motion is

00:25:42.610 --> 00:25:42.620
well fluid motion is
 

00:25:42.620 --> 00:25:44.620
well fluid motion is
elements appear from other elements and

00:25:44.620 --> 00:25:44.630
elements appear from other elements and
 

00:25:44.630 --> 00:25:46.810
elements appear from other elements and
then they disappear into other elements

00:25:46.810 --> 00:25:46.820
then they disappear into other elements
 

00:25:46.820 --> 00:25:48.880
then they disappear into other elements
right so things don't just spawn onto

00:25:48.880 --> 00:25:48.890
right so things don't just spawn onto
 

00:25:48.890 --> 00:25:49.470
right so things don't just spawn onto
the screen

00:25:49.470 --> 00:25:49.480
the screen
 

00:25:49.480 --> 00:25:51.820
the screen
willy-nilly right that's why we're

00:25:51.820 --> 00:25:51.830
willy-nilly right that's why we're
 

00:25:51.830 --> 00:25:55.180
willy-nilly right that's why we're
animating these things the motion is

00:25:55.180 --> 00:25:55.190
animating these things the motion is
 

00:25:55.190 --> 00:25:58.750
animating these things the motion is
natural and the motion is subtle right

00:25:58.750 --> 00:25:58.760
natural and the motion is subtle right
 

00:25:58.760 --> 00:26:00.760
natural and the motion is subtle right
so when things are elements we might

00:26:00.760 --> 00:26:00.770
so when things are elements we might
 

00:26:00.770 --> 00:26:02.710
so when things are elements we might
want the user to notice that when they D

00:26:02.710 --> 00:26:02.720
want the user to notice that when they D
 

00:26:02.720 --> 00:26:04.570
want the user to notice that when they D
spawn we user probably doesn't care

00:26:04.570 --> 00:26:04.580
spawn we user probably doesn't care
 

00:26:04.580 --> 00:26:06.310
spawn we user probably doesn't care
we're gonna be subtle about that we're

00:26:06.310 --> 00:26:06.320
we're gonna be subtle about that we're
 

00:26:06.320 --> 00:26:07.390
we're gonna be subtle about that we're
going to go ahead and are gonna combine

00:26:07.390 --> 00:26:07.400
going to go ahead and are gonna combine
 

00:26:07.400 --> 00:26:08.440
going to go ahead and are gonna combine
everything that we've kind of learned

00:26:08.440 --> 00:26:08.450
everything that we've kind of learned
 

00:26:08.450 --> 00:26:10.870
everything that we've kind of learned
into this one giant heap in order to

00:26:10.870 --> 00:26:10.880
into this one giant heap in order to
 

00:26:10.880 --> 00:26:12.940
into this one giant heap in order to
create the animation that we need in

00:26:12.940 --> 00:26:12.950
create the animation that we need in
 

00:26:12.950 --> 00:26:14.620
create the animation that we need in
order to guide our users focus in a

00:26:14.620 --> 00:26:14.630
order to guide our users focus in a
 

00:26:14.630 --> 00:26:19.180
order to guide our users focus in a
fluid manner so here's an example from

00:26:19.180 --> 00:26:19.190
fluid manner so here's an example from
 

00:26:19.190 --> 00:26:22.750
fluid manner so here's an example from
my app right RetailMeNot so we have this

00:26:22.750 --> 00:26:22.760
my app right RetailMeNot so we have this
 

00:26:22.760 --> 00:26:27.520
my app right RetailMeNot so we have this
navigation toolbar this home row and in

00:26:27.520 --> 00:26:27.530
navigation toolbar this home row and in
 

00:26:27.530 --> 00:26:28.840
navigation toolbar this home row and in
some parts of the app we don't actually

00:26:28.840 --> 00:26:28.850
some parts of the app we don't actually
 

00:26:28.850 --> 00:26:31.750
some parts of the app we don't actually
always need this right so how do we get

00:26:31.750 --> 00:26:31.760
always need this right so how do we get
 

00:26:31.760 --> 00:26:33.880
always need this right so how do we get
rid of this home row without kind of

00:26:33.880 --> 00:26:33.890
rid of this home row without kind of
 

00:26:33.890 --> 00:26:35.830
rid of this home row without kind of
throwing the user off right because this

00:26:35.830 --> 00:26:35.840
throwing the user off right because this
 

00:26:35.840 --> 00:26:37.540
throwing the user off right because this
is like our core central navigation

00:26:37.540 --> 00:26:37.550
is like our core central navigation
 

00:26:37.550 --> 00:26:38.890
is like our core central navigation
feature and we want to hide it in some

00:26:38.890 --> 00:26:38.900
feature and we want to hide it in some
 

00:26:38.900 --> 00:26:42.880
feature and we want to hide it in some
places right how do we do that well we

00:26:42.880 --> 00:26:42.890
places right how do we do that well we
 

00:26:42.890 --> 00:26:44.650
places right how do we do that well we
do that like this we fade away the

00:26:44.650 --> 00:26:44.660
do that like this we fade away the
 

00:26:44.660 --> 00:26:46.660
do that like this we fade away the
background and the colors end up on

00:26:46.660 --> 00:26:46.670
background and the colors end up on
 

00:26:46.670 --> 00:26:49.540
background and the colors end up on
white and then we just swipe away the

00:26:49.540 --> 00:26:49.550
white and then we just swipe away the
 

00:26:49.550 --> 00:26:52.480
white and then we just swipe away the
the colors turns out people don't notice

00:26:52.480 --> 00:26:52.490
the colors turns out people don't notice
 

00:26:52.490 --> 00:26:54.370
the colors turns out people don't notice
that animation whenever we need to play

00:26:54.370 --> 00:26:54.380
that animation whenever we need to play
 

00:26:54.380 --> 00:26:55.600
that animation whenever we need to play
this animation we need to play it

00:26:55.600 --> 00:26:55.610
this animation we need to play it
 

00:26:55.610 --> 00:26:57.010
this animation we need to play it
because we're transitioning to a screen

00:26:57.010 --> 00:26:57.020
because we're transitioning to a screen
 

00:26:57.020 --> 00:26:58.030
because we're transitioning to a screen
that doesn't need that home row

00:26:58.030 --> 00:26:58.040
that doesn't need that home row
 

00:26:58.040 --> 00:27:00.400
that doesn't need that home row
navigation well because we're being

00:27:00.400 --> 00:27:00.410
navigation well because we're being
 

00:27:00.410 --> 00:27:02.560
navigation well because we're being
subtle about this because it's fast and

00:27:02.560 --> 00:27:02.570
subtle about this because it's fast and
 

00:27:02.570 --> 00:27:04.330
subtle about this because it's fast and
because it's fluid people don't actually

00:27:04.330 --> 00:27:04.340
because it's fluid people don't actually
 

00:27:04.340 --> 00:27:06.100
because it's fluid people don't actually
notice that this animation plays and

00:27:06.100 --> 00:27:06.110
notice that this animation plays and
 

00:27:06.110 --> 00:27:09.160
notice that this animation plays and
that this entire row is gone so it

00:27:09.160 --> 00:27:09.170
that this entire row is gone so it
 

00:27:09.170 --> 00:27:10.810
that this entire row is gone so it
actually is it being really awesome and

00:27:10.810 --> 00:27:10.820
actually is it being really awesome and
 

00:27:10.820 --> 00:27:13.630
actually is it being really awesome and
like we can transition from just the

00:27:13.630 --> 00:27:13.640
like we can transition from just the
 

00:27:13.640 --> 00:27:16.450
like we can transition from just the
toolbar to the toolbar with a double row

00:27:16.450 --> 00:27:16.460
toolbar to the toolbar with a double row
 

00:27:16.460 --> 00:27:19.630
toolbar to the toolbar with a double row
with the secondary navigation but we can

00:27:19.630 --> 00:27:19.640
with the secondary navigation but we can
 

00:27:19.640 --> 00:27:20.700
with the secondary navigation but we can
make this better

00:27:20.700 --> 00:27:20.710
make this better
 

00:27:20.710 --> 00:27:23.080
make this better
quite frankly we'd like to have that

00:27:23.080 --> 00:27:23.090
quite frankly we'd like to have that
 

00:27:23.090 --> 00:27:25.390
quite frankly we'd like to have that
animation play and then we'd like to be

00:27:25.390 --> 00:27:25.400
animation play and then we'd like to be
 

00:27:25.400 --> 00:27:27.220
animation play and then we'd like to be
able to tell the user when the animation

00:27:27.220 --> 00:27:27.230
able to tell the user when the animation
 

00:27:27.230 --> 00:27:28.630
able to tell the user when the animation
is back right when those buttons come

00:27:28.630 --> 00:27:28.640
is back right when those buttons come
 

00:27:28.640 --> 00:27:29.950
is back right when those buttons come
back we don't want it to be that subtle

00:27:29.950 --> 00:27:29.960
back we don't want it to be that subtle
 

00:27:29.960 --> 00:27:31.810
back we don't want it to be that subtle
that's not necessarily the right way to

00:27:31.810 --> 00:27:31.820
that's not necessarily the right way to
 

00:27:31.820 --> 00:27:35.919
that's not necessarily the right way to
go the way that we can do that are sorry

00:27:35.919 --> 00:27:35.929
go the way that we can do that are sorry
 

00:27:35.929 --> 00:27:37.810
go the way that we can do that are sorry
actually I forgot to mention something

00:27:37.810 --> 00:27:37.820
actually I forgot to mention something
 

00:27:37.820 --> 00:27:41.310
actually I forgot to mention something
or other I talked about it already right

00:27:41.310 --> 00:27:41.320
or other I talked about it already right
 

00:27:41.320 --> 00:27:44.650
or other I talked about it already right
the reason that we want to do this we

00:27:44.650 --> 00:27:44.660
the reason that we want to do this we
 

00:27:44.660 --> 00:27:45.700
the reason that we want to do this we
established the element with the

00:27:45.700 --> 00:27:45.710
established the element with the
 

00:27:45.710 --> 00:27:47.860
established the element with the
hierarchy between elements clearly that

00:27:47.860 --> 00:27:47.870
hierarchy between elements clearly that
 

00:27:47.870 --> 00:27:49.510
hierarchy between elements clearly that
toolbar right there is much more

00:27:49.510 --> 00:27:49.520
toolbar right there is much more
 

00:27:49.520 --> 00:27:52.419
toolbar right there is much more
important than the secondary navigation

00:27:52.419 --> 00:27:52.429
important than the secondary navigation
 

00:27:52.429 --> 00:27:54.640
important than the secondary navigation
in this case right so we establish that

00:27:54.640 --> 00:27:54.650
in this case right so we establish that
 

00:27:54.650 --> 00:27:56.410
in this case right so we establish that
that toolbar is on top

00:27:56.410 --> 00:27:56.420
that toolbar is on top
 

00:27:56.420 --> 00:27:58.660
that toolbar is on top
it's more important and is always going

00:27:58.660 --> 00:27:58.670
it's more important and is always going
 

00:27:58.670 --> 00:27:59.890
it's more important and is always going
to be there the secondary navigation

00:27:59.890 --> 00:27:59.900
to be there the secondary navigation
 

00:27:59.900 --> 00:28:01.810
to be there the secondary navigation
slides in and out depending on whether

00:28:01.810 --> 00:28:01.820
slides in and out depending on whether
 

00:28:01.820 --> 00:28:03.820
slides in and out depending on whether
or not we need it so clearly it's not as

00:28:03.820 --> 00:28:03.830
or not we need it so clearly it's not as
 

00:28:03.830 --> 00:28:07.120
or not we need it so clearly it's not as
important right tabs are secondary but

00:28:07.120 --> 00:28:07.130
important right tabs are secondary but
 

00:28:07.130 --> 00:28:08.560
important right tabs are secondary but
then we also build and change seems

00:28:08.560 --> 00:28:08.570
then we also build and change seems
 

00:28:08.570 --> 00:28:12.250
then we also build and change seems
scenes seamlessly right so we hide

00:28:12.250 --> 00:28:12.260
scenes seamlessly right so we hide
 

00:28:12.260 --> 00:28:14.290
scenes seamlessly right so we hide
elements that we don't need at the

00:28:14.290 --> 00:28:14.300
elements that we don't need at the
 

00:28:14.300 --> 00:28:19.300
elements that we don't need at the
moment right unobtrusively great so now

00:28:19.300 --> 00:28:19.310
moment right unobtrusively great so now
 

00:28:19.310 --> 00:28:20.680
moment right unobtrusively great so now
then going back to what we were talking

00:28:20.680 --> 00:28:20.690
then going back to what we were talking
 

00:28:20.690 --> 00:28:22.330
then going back to what we were talking
about let's say that we wanted to have

00:28:22.330 --> 00:28:22.340
about let's say that we wanted to have
 

00:28:22.340 --> 00:28:23.680
about let's say that we wanted to have
the user pay a little bit more attention

00:28:23.680 --> 00:28:23.690
the user pay a little bit more attention
 

00:28:23.690 --> 00:28:24.940
the user pay a little bit more attention
to the actual animation when it comes

00:28:24.940 --> 00:28:24.950
to the actual animation when it comes
 

00:28:24.950 --> 00:28:27.250
to the actual animation when it comes
back in how can we do that well the way

00:28:27.250 --> 00:28:27.260
back in how can we do that well the way
 

00:28:27.260 --> 00:28:28.780
back in how can we do that well the way
that we do that is by blending colors

00:28:28.780 --> 00:28:28.790
that we do that is by blending colors
 

00:28:28.790 --> 00:28:30.580
that we do that is by blending colors
right again this is one of the fast

00:28:30.580 --> 00:28:30.590
right again this is one of the fast
 

00:28:30.590 --> 00:28:32.260
right again this is one of the fast
pathways in your brain this is going to

00:28:32.260 --> 00:28:32.270
pathways in your brain this is going to
 

00:28:32.270 --> 00:28:33.640
pathways in your brain this is going to
be really fast for user should notice

00:28:33.640 --> 00:28:33.650
be really fast for user should notice
 

00:28:33.650 --> 00:28:35.440
be really fast for user should notice
users are going to notice this right so

00:28:35.440 --> 00:28:35.450
users are going to notice this right so
 

00:28:35.450 --> 00:28:37.030
users are going to notice this right so
let's say we come in and we have this

00:28:37.030 --> 00:28:37.040
let's say we come in and we have this
 

00:28:37.040 --> 00:28:38.290
let's say we come in and we have this
toolbar and we want to bring back those

00:28:38.290 --> 00:28:38.300
toolbar and we want to bring back those
 

00:28:38.300 --> 00:28:40.030
toolbar and we want to bring back those
navigation buttons right how can we do

00:28:40.030 --> 00:28:40.040
navigation buttons right how can we do
 

00:28:40.040 --> 00:28:42.130
navigation buttons right how can we do
that in a much more seamless way there

00:28:42.130 --> 00:28:42.140
that in a much more seamless way there
 

00:28:42.140 --> 00:28:43.600
that in a much more seamless way there
we go we can blend the colors together

00:28:43.600 --> 00:28:43.610
we go we can blend the colors together
 

00:28:43.610 --> 00:28:45.460
we go we can blend the colors together
right so we're using that circular

00:28:45.460 --> 00:28:45.470
right so we're using that circular
 

00:28:45.470 --> 00:28:47.260
right so we're using that circular
reveal to kind of come from that new

00:28:47.260 --> 00:28:47.270
reveal to kind of come from that new
 

00:28:47.270 --> 00:28:49.450
reveal to kind of come from that new
top-level toolbar and then we're going

00:28:49.450 --> 00:28:49.460
top-level toolbar and then we're going
 

00:28:49.460 --> 00:28:51.010
top-level toolbar and then we're going
to animate in and we're gonna animate it

00:28:51.010 --> 00:28:51.020
to animate in and we're gonna animate it
 

00:28:51.020 --> 00:28:52.990
to animate in and we're gonna animate it
in all those tabs and this tells the

00:28:52.990 --> 00:28:53.000
in all those tabs and this tells the
 

00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:55.540
in all those tabs and this tells the
user again those tabs are back first of

00:28:55.540 --> 00:28:55.550
user again those tabs are back first of
 

00:28:55.550 --> 00:28:57.160
user again those tabs are back first of
all it makes them notice that and the

00:28:57.160 --> 00:28:57.170
all it makes them notice that and the
 

00:28:57.170 --> 00:28:58.540
all it makes them notice that and the
second thing is that tells the user that

00:28:58.540 --> 00:28:58.550
second thing is that tells the user that
 

00:28:58.550 --> 00:29:00.040
second thing is that tells the user that
those tabs are related to that

00:29:00.040 --> 00:29:00.050
those tabs are related to that
 

00:29:00.050 --> 00:29:01.990
those tabs are related to that
navigation bar right so even if we have

00:29:01.990 --> 00:29:02.000
navigation bar right so even if we have
 

00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:03.430
navigation bar right so even if we have
other stuff on the screen that's going

00:29:03.430 --> 00:29:03.440
other stuff on the screen that's going
 

00:29:03.440 --> 00:29:05.470
other stuff on the screen that's going
to be purple the users are still going

00:29:05.470 --> 00:29:05.480
to be purple the users are still going
 

00:29:05.480 --> 00:29:07.480
to be purple the users are still going
to notice those those toolbar come back

00:29:07.480 --> 00:29:07.490
to notice those those toolbar come back
 

00:29:07.490 --> 00:29:14.110
to notice those those toolbar come back
in cool right brain perf group stuff by

00:29:14.110 --> 00:29:14.120
in cool right brain perf group stuff by
 

00:29:14.120 --> 00:29:21.970
in cool right brain perf group stuff by
colors all right so we kind of had this

00:29:21.970 --> 00:29:21.980
colors all right so we kind of had this
 

00:29:21.980 --> 00:29:24.730
colors all right so we kind of had this
weird animation in the beginning of our

00:29:24.730 --> 00:29:24.740
weird animation in the beginning of our
 

00:29:24.740 --> 00:29:29.530
weird animation in the beginning of our
talk and right so this thing and it's

00:29:29.530 --> 00:29:29.540
talk and right so this thing and it's
 

00:29:29.540 --> 00:29:31.990
talk and right so this thing and it's
kind of interesting right so what is

00:29:31.990 --> 00:29:32.000
kind of interesting right so what is
 

00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:33.520
kind of interesting right so what is
this actually doing well this is

00:29:33.520 --> 00:29:33.530
this actually doing well this is
 

00:29:33.530 --> 00:29:35.260
this actually doing well this is
blending shapes together right so

00:29:35.260 --> 00:29:35.270
blending shapes together right so
 

00:29:35.270 --> 00:29:37.450
blending shapes together right so
outside of blending colors which is one

00:29:37.450 --> 00:29:37.460
outside of blending colors which is one
 

00:29:37.460 --> 00:29:38.860
outside of blending colors which is one
of the fast pathways in your brain you

00:29:38.860 --> 00:29:38.870
of the fast pathways in your brain you
 

00:29:38.870 --> 00:29:40.630
of the fast pathways in your brain you
can also blend shapes another fast

00:29:40.630 --> 00:29:40.640
can also blend shapes another fast
 

00:29:40.640 --> 00:29:42.340
can also blend shapes another fast
pathway in your brain turns out your

00:29:42.340 --> 00:29:42.350
pathway in your brain turns out your
 

00:29:42.350 --> 00:29:43.930
pathway in your brain turns out your
brain actually does this really fast and

00:29:43.930 --> 00:29:43.940
brain actually does this really fast and
 

00:29:43.940 --> 00:29:46.900
brain actually does this really fast and
it kind of understands this but this is

00:29:46.900 --> 00:29:46.910
it kind of understands this but this is
 

00:29:46.910 --> 00:29:48.880
it kind of understands this but this is
kind of a weird example I don't know if

00:29:48.880 --> 00:29:48.890
kind of a weird example I don't know if
 

00:29:48.890 --> 00:29:50.020
kind of a weird example I don't know if
you guys remember but this was one of

00:29:50.020 --> 00:29:50.030
you guys remember but this was one of
 

00:29:50.030 --> 00:29:51.880
you guys remember but this was one of
the examples that I use to define what

00:29:51.880 --> 00:29:51.890
the examples that I use to define what
 

00:29:51.890 --> 00:29:54.430
the examples that I use to define what
material is right but what material

00:29:54.430 --> 00:29:54.440
material is right but what material
 

00:29:54.440 --> 00:29:56.970
material is right but what material
actually behaves like that right like

00:29:56.970 --> 00:29:56.980
actually behaves like that right like
 

00:29:56.980 --> 00:30:02.260
actually behaves like that right like
plastic mmm not really well it actually

00:30:02.260 --> 00:30:02.270
plastic mmm not really well it actually
 

00:30:02.270 --> 00:30:04.180
plastic mmm not really well it actually
turns out that this material behaves

00:30:04.180 --> 00:30:04.190
turns out that this material behaves
 

00:30:04.190 --> 00:30:05.440
turns out that this material behaves
similar the way you'd find in a lava

00:30:05.440 --> 00:30:05.450
similar the way you'd find in a lava
 

00:30:05.450 --> 00:30:08.890
similar the way you'd find in a lava
lamp right that is to say something

00:30:08.890 --> 00:30:08.900
lamp right that is to say something
 

00:30:08.900 --> 00:30:13.409
lamp right that is to say something
gooey

00:30:13.409 --> 00:30:13.419
 
 

00:30:13.419 --> 00:30:17.769
 
so with that if we take that gooeyness

00:30:17.769 --> 00:30:17.779
so with that if we take that gooeyness
 

00:30:17.779 --> 00:30:21.009
so with that if we take that gooeyness
we can literally create fluid motion

00:30:21.009 --> 00:30:21.019
we can literally create fluid motion
 

00:30:21.019 --> 00:30:24.999
we can literally create fluid motion
right so don't just have fluid motion in

00:30:24.999 --> 00:30:25.009
right so don't just have fluid motion in
 

00:30:25.009 --> 00:30:29.080
right so don't just have fluid motion in
your app be fluid motion have your views

00:30:29.080 --> 00:30:29.090
your app be fluid motion have your views
 

00:30:29.090 --> 00:30:31.990
your app be fluid motion have your views
animate as if they were a fluid right

00:30:31.990 --> 00:30:32.000
animate as if they were a fluid right
 

00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:39.879
animate as if they were a fluid right
make your views gooey so what is gooey

00:30:39.879 --> 00:30:39.889
make your views gooey so what is gooey
 

00:30:39.889 --> 00:30:40.960
make your views gooey so what is gooey
what does that even mean

00:30:40.960 --> 00:30:40.970
what does that even mean
 

00:30:40.970 --> 00:30:43.389
what does that even mean
well you simulate your views as if they

00:30:43.389 --> 00:30:43.399
well you simulate your views as if they
 

00:30:43.399 --> 00:30:45.460
well you simulate your views as if they
were a high viscosity fluid right so

00:30:45.460 --> 00:30:45.470
were a high viscosity fluid right so
 

00:30:45.470 --> 00:30:47.169
were a high viscosity fluid right so
something that doesn't necessarily flow

00:30:47.169 --> 00:30:47.179
something that doesn't necessarily flow
 

00:30:47.179 --> 00:30:48.879
something that doesn't necessarily flow
like water maybe something more like

00:30:48.879 --> 00:30:48.889
like water maybe something more like
 

00:30:48.889 --> 00:30:53.259
like water maybe something more like
molasses your views looks say solid when

00:30:53.259 --> 00:30:53.269
molasses your views looks say solid when
 

00:30:53.269 --> 00:30:55.629
molasses your views looks say solid when
they're stationary so your views seem as

00:30:55.629 --> 00:30:55.639
they're stationary so your views seem as
 

00:30:55.639 --> 00:30:57.789
they're stationary so your views seem as
if they were actual buttons or whatever

00:30:57.789 --> 00:30:57.799
if they were actual buttons or whatever
 

00:30:57.799 --> 00:30:59.889
if they were actual buttons or whatever
the user needs for that specific case

00:30:59.889 --> 00:30:59.899
the user needs for that specific case
 

00:30:59.899 --> 00:31:01.899
the user needs for that specific case
but they move as if they were liquid so

00:31:01.899 --> 00:31:01.909
but they move as if they were liquid so
 

00:31:01.909 --> 00:31:03.310
but they move as if they were liquid so
that they can transform into each other

00:31:03.310 --> 00:31:03.320
that they can transform into each other
 

00:31:03.320 --> 00:31:06.820
that they can transform into each other
they can move they can flow through your

00:31:06.820 --> 00:31:06.830
they can move they can flow through your
 

00:31:06.830 --> 00:31:10.960
they can move they can flow through your
app and before we kind of go on I want

00:31:10.960 --> 00:31:10.970
app and before we kind of go on I want
 

00:31:10.970 --> 00:31:15.789
app and before we kind of go on I want
to show you guys this animation by Jake

the user with the context of what
 

00:31:52.970 --> 00:31:54.310
the user with the context of what
they're actually doing within the scene

00:31:54.310 --> 00:31:54.320
they're actually doing within the scene

they're actually doing within the scene
buttons transform you understand what

00:31:56.889 --> 00:31:56.899
buttons transform you understand what
 

00:31:56.899 --> 00:31:58.529
buttons transform you understand what
you're doing right that blue button

00:31:58.529 --> 00:31:58.539
you're doing right that blue button
 

00:31:58.539 --> 00:32:00.789
you're doing right that blue button
transformed into a selector that

00:32:00.789 --> 00:32:00.799
transformed into a selector that
 

00:32:00.799 --> 00:32:02.799
transformed into a selector that
selector transforms into an OK button

00:32:02.799 --> 00:32:02.809
selector transforms into an OK button
 

00:32:02.809 --> 00:32:04.720
selector transforms into an OK button
you know exactly what you're doing on

00:32:04.720 --> 00:32:04.730
you know exactly what you're doing on
 

00:32:04.730 --> 00:32:06.549
you know exactly what you're doing on
the screen you know exactly the order of

00:32:06.549 --> 00:32:06.559
the screen you know exactly the order of
 

00:32:06.559 --> 00:32:08.019
the screen you know exactly the order of
operations you know exactly what's

00:32:08.019 --> 00:32:08.029
operations you know exactly what's
 

00:32:08.029 --> 00:32:10.299
operations you know exactly what's
happening because all of these views are

00:32:10.299 --> 00:32:10.309
happening because all of these views are
 

00:32:10.309 --> 00:32:11.769
happening because all of these views are
morphing from one to another it

00:32:11.769 --> 00:32:11.779
morphing from one to another it
 

00:32:11.779 --> 00:32:13.930
morphing from one to another it
sequentially follows that views that

00:32:13.930 --> 00:32:13.940
sequentially follows that views that
 

00:32:13.940 --> 00:32:16.749
sequentially follows that views that
morph from one to another relate to each

00:32:16.749 --> 00:32:16.759
morph from one to another relate to each
 

00:32:16.759 --> 00:32:21.650
morph from one to another relate to each
other so

00:32:21.650 --> 00:32:21.660
other so
 

00:32:21.660 --> 00:32:23.570
other so
let's talk a little bit more about goop

00:32:23.570 --> 00:32:23.580
let's talk a little bit more about goop
 

00:32:23.580 --> 00:32:28.040
let's talk a little bit more about goop
goop easily changes shape which means

00:32:28.040 --> 00:32:28.050
goop easily changes shape which means
 

00:32:28.050 --> 00:32:29.120
goop easily changes shape which means
that you can take something like a

00:32:29.120 --> 00:32:29.130
that you can take something like a
 

00:32:29.130 --> 00:32:30.980
that you can take something like a
square button and animate it into a

00:32:30.980 --> 00:32:30.990
square button and animate it into a
 

00:32:30.990 --> 00:32:33.500
square button and animate it into a
circle and it changes that shape and it

00:32:33.500 --> 00:32:33.510
circle and it changes that shape and it
 

00:32:33.510 --> 00:32:38.420
circle and it changes that shape and it
goes smoothly and it's natural right if

00:32:38.420 --> 00:32:38.430
goes smoothly and it's natural right if
 

00:32:38.430 --> 00:32:40.190
goes smoothly and it's natural right if
your views behave as if they were gooey

00:32:40.190 --> 00:32:40.200
your views behave as if they were gooey
 

00:32:40.200 --> 00:32:45.860
your views behave as if they were gooey
it's a natural animation views also can

00:32:45.860 --> 00:32:45.870
it's a natural animation views also can
 

00:32:45.870 --> 00:32:47.510
it's a natural animation views also can
easily create other elements from each

00:32:47.510 --> 00:32:47.520
easily create other elements from each
 

00:32:47.520 --> 00:32:49.880
easily create other elements from each
other right so as you're moving along if

00:32:49.880 --> 00:32:49.890
other right so as you're moving along if
 

00:32:49.890 --> 00:32:51.740
other right so as you're moving along if
you need to spawn more views you can

00:32:51.740 --> 00:32:51.750
you need to spawn more views you can
 

00:32:51.750 --> 00:32:53.720
you need to spawn more views you can
spawn more views from one another and

00:32:53.720 --> 00:32:53.730
spawn more views from one another and
 

00:32:53.730 --> 00:32:55.190
spawn more views from one another and
it's naturally understood by the user

00:32:55.190 --> 00:32:55.200
it's naturally understood by the user
 

00:32:55.200 --> 00:32:56.750
it's naturally understood by the user
that those views relate to each other

00:32:56.750 --> 00:32:56.760
that those views relate to each other
 

00:32:56.760 --> 00:32:58.670
that those views relate to each other
right you wouldn't put three separate

00:32:58.670 --> 00:32:58.680
right you wouldn't put three separate
 

00:32:58.680 --> 00:33:00.710
right you wouldn't put three separate
buttons on the screen that animate in

00:33:00.710 --> 00:33:00.720
buttons on the screen that animate in
 

00:33:00.720 --> 00:33:02.240
buttons on the screen that animate in
that format and then not have them

00:33:02.240 --> 00:33:02.250
that format and then not have them
 

00:33:02.250 --> 00:33:03.830
that format and then not have them
relate to each other they should all be

00:33:03.830 --> 00:33:03.840
relate to each other they should all be
 

00:33:03.840 --> 00:33:05.360
relate to each other they should all be
meaningful right so if you have for

00:33:05.360 --> 00:33:05.370
meaningful right so if you have for
 

00:33:05.370 --> 00:33:08.030
meaningful right so if you have for
example three menu options you animate

00:33:08.030 --> 00:33:08.040
example three menu options you animate
 

00:33:08.040 --> 00:33:10.520
example three menu options you animate
them from one menu button and you get

00:33:10.520 --> 00:33:10.530
them from one menu button and you get
 

00:33:10.530 --> 00:33:12.920
them from one menu button and you get
three different buttons that all relate

00:33:12.920 --> 00:33:12.930
three different buttons that all relate
 

00:33:12.930 --> 00:33:14.120
three different buttons that all relate
to each other and the user kind of

00:33:14.120 --> 00:33:14.130
to each other and the user kind of
 

00:33:14.130 --> 00:33:15.830
to each other and the user kind of
intuitively knows that those things

00:33:15.830 --> 00:33:15.840
intuitively knows that those things
 

00:33:15.840 --> 00:33:18.140
intuitively knows that those things
relate to each other because again that

00:33:18.140 --> 00:33:18.150
relate to each other because again that
 

00:33:18.150 --> 00:33:20.000
relate to each other because again that
happens faster in your brain then if

00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:20.010
happens faster in your brain then if
 

00:33:20.010 --> 00:33:21.800
happens faster in your brain then if
they were to scan each and every single

00:33:21.800 --> 00:33:21.810
they were to scan each and every single
 

00:33:21.810 --> 00:33:23.120
they were to scan each and every single
one of those buttons and decide whether

00:33:23.120 --> 00:33:23.130
one of those buttons and decide whether
 

00:33:23.130 --> 00:33:27.080
one of those buttons and decide whether
or not they relate to each other right

00:33:27.080 --> 00:33:27.090
or not they relate to each other right
 

00:33:27.090 --> 00:33:28.880
or not they relate to each other right
so will eight elements of one another

00:33:28.880 --> 00:33:28.890
so will eight elements of one another
 

00:33:28.890 --> 00:33:32.600
so will eight elements of one another
using this sort of GUI animation so how

00:33:32.600 --> 00:33:32.610
using this sort of GUI animation so how
 

00:33:32.610 --> 00:33:34.010
using this sort of GUI animation so how
do you actually do this in Android right

00:33:34.010 --> 00:33:34.020
do you actually do this in Android right
 

00:33:34.020 --> 00:33:36.200
do you actually do this in Android right
this is not a trivial task we're getting

00:33:36.200 --> 00:33:36.210
this is not a trivial task we're getting
 

00:33:36.210 --> 00:33:38.030
this is not a trivial task we're getting
into sort of this really interesting

00:33:38.030 --> 00:33:38.040
into sort of this really interesting
 

00:33:38.040 --> 00:33:39.620
into sort of this really interesting
part of Android that hasn't been done

00:33:39.620 --> 00:33:39.630
part of Android that hasn't been done
 

00:33:39.630 --> 00:33:41.000
part of Android that hasn't been done
for you by Google everything that I've

00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:41.010
for you by Google everything that I've
 

00:33:41.010 --> 00:33:43.160
for you by Google everything that I've
talked to about to this point has

00:33:43.160 --> 00:33:43.170
talked to about to this point has
 

00:33:43.170 --> 00:33:46.430
talked to about to this point has
already been done for you well we can

00:33:46.430 --> 00:33:46.440
already been done for you well we can
 

00:33:46.440 --> 00:33:47.570
already been done for you well we can
kind of categorize this goop into

00:33:47.570 --> 00:33:47.580
kind of categorize this goop into
 

00:33:47.580 --> 00:33:51.410
kind of categorize this goop into
several different situations and the

00:33:51.410 --> 00:33:51.420
several different situations and the
 

00:33:51.420 --> 00:33:53.030
several different situations and the
first one is simple simulations right so

00:33:53.030 --> 00:33:53.040
first one is simple simulations right so
 

00:33:53.040 --> 00:33:55.880
first one is simple simulations right so
something that not too hard to kind of

00:33:55.880 --> 00:33:55.890
something that not too hard to kind of
 

00:33:55.890 --> 00:33:57.590
something that not too hard to kind of
fake and the way that you can do this is

00:33:57.590 --> 00:33:57.600
fake and the way that you can do this is
 

00:33:57.600 --> 00:33:59.060
fake and the way that you can do this is
with vector drawables and canvas

00:33:59.060 --> 00:33:59.070
with vector drawables and canvas
 

00:33:59.070 --> 00:34:01.610
with vector drawables and canvas
animations and we'll talk a little bit

00:34:01.610 --> 00:34:01.620
animations and we'll talk a little bit
 

00:34:01.620 --> 00:34:03.110
animations and we'll talk a little bit
more come out canvas animations in a

00:34:03.110 --> 00:34:03.120
more come out canvas animations in a
 

00:34:03.120 --> 00:34:04.220
more come out canvas animations in a
second if you have something a little

00:34:04.220 --> 00:34:04.230
second if you have something a little
 

00:34:04.230 --> 00:34:06.890
second if you have something a little
bit more medium complexity right then

00:34:06.890 --> 00:34:06.900
bit more medium complexity right then
 

00:34:06.900 --> 00:34:08.149
bit more medium complexity right then
you might want to have an animation list

00:34:08.149 --> 00:34:08.159
you might want to have an animation list
 

00:34:08.159 --> 00:34:09.770
you might want to have an animation list
right so if you have views that kind of

00:34:09.770 --> 00:34:09.780
right so if you have views that kind of
 

00:34:09.780 --> 00:34:11.750
right so if you have views that kind of
transition between each other or if that

00:34:11.750 --> 00:34:11.760
transition between each other or if that
 

00:34:11.760 --> 00:34:14.480
transition between each other or if that
animation is reversible so you can play

00:34:14.480 --> 00:34:14.490
animation is reversible so you can play
 

00:34:14.490 --> 00:34:16.550
animation is reversible so you can play
it forwards and backwards you can use an

00:34:16.550 --> 00:34:16.560
it forwards and backwards you can use an
 

00:34:16.560 --> 00:34:19.550
it forwards and backwards you can use an
animation list to keep that to animate

00:34:19.550 --> 00:34:19.560
animation list to keep that to animate
 

00:34:19.560 --> 00:34:22.190
animation list to keep that to animate
that but that's a little bit more costly

00:34:22.190 --> 00:34:22.200
that but that's a little bit more costly
 

00:34:22.200 --> 00:34:24.350
that but that's a little bit more costly
for you because you need a designer for

00:34:24.350 --> 00:34:24.360
for you because you need a designer for
 

00:34:24.360 --> 00:34:25.430
for you because you need a designer for
that but we'll talk about that later

00:34:25.430 --> 00:34:25.440
that but we'll talk about that later
 

00:34:25.440 --> 00:34:27.830
that but we'll talk about that later
and then we have our hyper complex right

00:34:27.830 --> 00:34:27.840
and then we have our hyper complex right
 

00:34:27.840 --> 00:34:29.780
and then we have our hyper complex right
stuff that just like we don't know what

00:34:29.780 --> 00:34:29.790
stuff that just like we don't know what
 

00:34:29.790 --> 00:34:31.970
stuff that just like we don't know what
like we can't do this in any other way

00:34:31.970 --> 00:34:31.980
like we can't do this in any other way
 

00:34:31.980 --> 00:34:34.669
like we can't do this in any other way
and for that we actually need true fluid

00:34:34.669 --> 00:34:34.679
and for that we actually need true fluid
 

00:34:34.679 --> 00:34:36.369
and for that we actually need true fluid
simulation

00:34:36.369 --> 00:34:36.379
simulation
 

00:34:36.379 --> 00:34:40.580
simulation
so let's talk about the simple stuff

00:34:40.580 --> 00:34:40.590
so let's talk about the simple stuff
 

00:34:40.590 --> 00:34:43.850
so let's talk about the simple stuff
first right so if we have a static

00:34:43.850 --> 00:34:43.860
first right so if we have a static
 

00:34:43.860 --> 00:34:45.440
first right so if we have a static
animation that's always gonna play and

00:34:45.440 --> 00:34:45.450
animation that's always gonna play and
 

00:34:45.450 --> 00:34:46.460
animation that's always gonna play and
it's always going to be the same

00:34:46.460 --> 00:34:46.470
it's always going to be the same
 

00:34:46.470 --> 00:34:49.250
it's always going to be the same
animation then we can just use a vector

00:34:49.250 --> 00:34:49.260
animation then we can just use a vector
 

00:34:49.260 --> 00:34:50.840
animation then we can just use a vector
drawable right we define our group in

00:34:50.840 --> 00:34:50.850
drawable right we define our group in
 

00:34:50.850 --> 00:34:53.540
drawable right we define our group in
sort of a vector we can animate between

00:34:53.540 --> 00:34:53.550
sort of a vector we can animate between
 

00:34:53.550 --> 00:34:54.830
sort of a vector we can animate between
those vectors in the same way that we

00:34:54.830 --> 00:34:54.840
those vectors in the same way that we
 

00:34:54.840 --> 00:34:56.360
those vectors in the same way that we
had before and then we can continue

00:34:56.360 --> 00:34:56.370
had before and then we can continue
 

00:34:56.370 --> 00:34:58.700
had before and then we can continue
onwards if we want something more

00:34:58.700 --> 00:34:58.710
onwards if we want something more
 

00:34:58.710 --> 00:35:00.320
onwards if we want something more
dynamic though we're gonna have to use

00:35:00.320 --> 00:35:00.330
dynamic though we're gonna have to use
 

00:35:00.330 --> 00:35:07.900
dynamic though we're gonna have to use
canvas animations so good job magic move

00:35:07.900 --> 00:35:07.910
 
 

00:35:07.910 --> 00:35:10.340
 
cuz of course I meant the animations

00:35:10.340 --> 00:35:10.350
cuz of course I meant the animations
 

00:35:10.350 --> 00:35:14.150
cuz of course I meant the animations
from the other one okay so canvas

00:35:14.150 --> 00:35:14.160
from the other one okay so canvas
 

00:35:14.160 --> 00:35:15.320
from the other one okay so canvas
animations are when you actually

00:35:15.320 --> 00:35:15.330
animations are when you actually
 

00:35:15.330 --> 00:35:17.420
animations are when you actually
override your views override your

00:35:17.420 --> 00:35:17.430
override your views override your
 

00:35:17.430 --> 00:35:20.870
override your views override your
drawables and you create your own paths

00:35:20.870 --> 00:35:20.880
drawables and you create your own paths
 

00:35:20.880 --> 00:35:23.510
drawables and you create your own paths
and you animate your own paths so this

00:35:23.510 --> 00:35:23.520
and you animate your own paths so this
 

00:35:23.520 --> 00:35:25.790
and you animate your own paths so this
is actually like making and drawing

00:35:25.790 --> 00:35:25.800
is actually like making and drawing
 

00:35:25.800 --> 00:35:27.920
is actually like making and drawing
views and invalidating them this isn't

00:35:27.920 --> 00:35:27.930
views and invalidating them this isn't
 

00:35:27.930 --> 00:35:29.570
views and invalidating them this isn't
as performant but it still works on

00:35:29.570 --> 00:35:29.580
as performant but it still works on
 

00:35:29.580 --> 00:35:31.130
as performant but it still works on
high-end phones but then again we're not

00:35:31.130 --> 00:35:31.140
high-end phones but then again we're not
 

00:35:31.140 --> 00:35:32.510
high-end phones but then again we're not
exactly trying to match this stuff to

00:35:32.510 --> 00:35:32.520
exactly trying to match this stuff to
 

00:35:32.520 --> 00:35:34.900
exactly trying to match this stuff to
really low-end phones like this is some

00:35:34.900 --> 00:35:34.910
really low-end phones like this is some
 

00:35:34.910 --> 00:35:37.730
really low-end phones like this is some
some hardcore animations here so it's

00:35:37.730 --> 00:35:37.740
some hardcore animations here so it's
 

00:35:37.740 --> 00:35:39.890
some hardcore animations here so it's
not gonna run on a low-end phone right

00:35:39.890 --> 00:35:39.900
not gonna run on a low-end phone right
 

00:35:39.900 --> 00:35:42.920
not gonna run on a low-end phone right
so we have this canvas and we drew this

00:35:42.920 --> 00:35:42.930
so we have this canvas and we drew this
 

00:35:42.930 --> 00:35:44.690
so we have this canvas and we drew this
path this is what this path looks like

00:35:44.690 --> 00:35:44.700
path this is what this path looks like
 

00:35:44.700 --> 00:35:49.250
path this is what this path looks like
simple triangle right but if we wanted

00:35:49.250 --> 00:35:49.260
simple triangle right but if we wanted
 

00:35:49.260 --> 00:35:51.110
simple triangle right but if we wanted
to make that triangle look and behave a

00:35:51.110 --> 00:35:51.120
to make that triangle look and behave a
 

00:35:51.120 --> 00:35:53.600
to make that triangle look and behave a
little bit more GUI we can add a corner

00:35:53.600 --> 00:35:53.610
little bit more GUI we can add a corner
 

00:35:53.610 --> 00:35:55.520
little bit more GUI we can add a corner
radius and that's what this corner

00:35:55.520 --> 00:35:55.530
radius and that's what this corner
 

00:35:55.530 --> 00:35:56.930
radius and that's what this corner
radius kind of looks like so here we

00:35:56.930 --> 00:35:56.940
radius kind of looks like so here we
 

00:35:56.940 --> 00:35:57.890
radius kind of looks like so here we
just kind of iterate through all these

00:35:57.890 --> 00:35:57.900
just kind of iterate through all these
 

00:35:57.900 --> 00:35:59.390
just kind of iterate through all these
values and I show you what the corner

00:35:59.390 --> 00:35:59.400
values and I show you what the corner
 

00:35:59.400 --> 00:36:01.310
values and I show you what the corner
radius kind of looks like when you apply

00:36:01.310 --> 00:36:01.320
radius kind of looks like when you apply
 

00:36:01.320 --> 00:36:03.260
radius kind of looks like when you apply
it right so at some point in time the

00:36:03.260 --> 00:36:03.270
it right so at some point in time the
 

00:36:03.270 --> 00:36:04.790
it right so at some point in time the
corner radius just goes way overboard

00:36:04.790 --> 00:36:04.800
corner radius just goes way overboard
 

00:36:04.800 --> 00:36:06.350
corner radius just goes way overboard
and it doesn't do anything anymore but

00:36:06.350 --> 00:36:06.360
and it doesn't do anything anymore but
 

00:36:06.360 --> 00:36:08.210
and it doesn't do anything anymore but
before but at the end at that point we

00:36:08.210 --> 00:36:08.220
before but at the end at that point we
 

00:36:08.220 --> 00:36:09.710
before but at the end at that point we
can actually start to use it and it kind

00:36:09.710 --> 00:36:09.720
can actually start to use it and it kind
 

00:36:09.720 --> 00:36:11.300
can actually start to use it and it kind
of starts using looking a little bit

00:36:11.300 --> 00:36:11.310
of starts using looking a little bit
 

00:36:11.310 --> 00:36:16.940
of starts using looking a little bit
gooey right so we can kind of use these

00:36:16.940 --> 00:36:16.950
gooey right so we can kind of use these
 

00:36:16.950 --> 00:36:19.820
gooey right so we can kind of use these
canvas animations to animate our views

00:36:19.820 --> 00:36:19.830
canvas animations to animate our views
 

00:36:19.830 --> 00:36:22.340
canvas animations to animate our views
and applying corner radius we can get a

00:36:22.340 --> 00:36:22.350
and applying corner radius we can get a
 

00:36:22.350 --> 00:36:24.890
and applying corner radius we can get a
pretty reasonable simulation of what a

00:36:24.890 --> 00:36:24.900
pretty reasonable simulation of what a
 

00:36:24.900 --> 00:36:26.450
pretty reasonable simulation of what a
GUI should look like if you were to

00:36:26.450 --> 00:36:26.460
GUI should look like if you were to
 

00:36:26.460 --> 00:36:27.830
GUI should look like if you were to
start animating your paths that is to

00:36:27.830 --> 00:36:27.840
start animating your paths that is to
 

00:36:27.840 --> 00:36:29.420
start animating your paths that is to
say take that path draw it to the screen

00:36:29.420 --> 00:36:29.430
say take that path draw it to the screen
 

00:36:29.430 --> 00:36:31.160
say take that path draw it to the screen
and then start changing values every

00:36:31.160 --> 00:36:31.170
and then start changing values every
 

00:36:31.170 --> 00:36:33.350
and then start changing values every
single frame well you can animate this

00:36:33.350 --> 00:36:33.360
single frame well you can animate this
 

00:36:33.360 --> 00:36:35.680
single frame well you can animate this
really cool sort of GUI like effect

00:36:35.680 --> 00:36:35.690
really cool sort of GUI like effect
 

00:36:35.690 --> 00:36:37.940
really cool sort of GUI like effect
again you want to use interpolators in

00:36:37.940 --> 00:36:37.950
again you want to use interpolators in
 

00:36:37.950 --> 00:36:39.970
again you want to use interpolators in
this because goo does behave in a

00:36:39.970 --> 00:36:39.980
this because goo does behave in a
 

00:36:39.980 --> 00:36:46.040
this because goo does behave in a
nonlinear fashion we can all use we can

00:36:46.040 --> 00:36:46.050
nonlinear fashion we can all use we can
 

00:36:46.050 --> 00:36:47.750
nonlinear fashion we can all use we can
also use animation sets right so for our

00:36:47.750 --> 00:36:47.760
also use animation sets right so for our
 

00:36:47.760 --> 00:36:48.380
also use animation sets right so for our
views they're a little bit more

00:36:48.380 --> 00:36:48.390
views they're a little bit more
 

00:36:48.390 --> 00:36:48.980
views they're a little bit more
complicate

00:36:48.980 --> 00:36:48.990
complicate
 

00:36:48.990 --> 00:36:51.800
complicate
we can't really do that in a simple

00:36:51.800 --> 00:36:51.810
we can't really do that in a simple
 

00:36:51.810 --> 00:36:53.750
we can't really do that in a simple
canvas animation we can start using

00:36:53.750 --> 00:36:53.760
canvas animation we can start using
 

00:36:53.760 --> 00:36:58.550
canvas animation we can start using
animation sets so this is a little bit

00:36:58.550 --> 00:36:58.560
animation sets so this is a little bit
 

00:36:58.560 --> 00:36:59.750
animation sets so this is a little bit
more costly because you have to render

00:36:59.750 --> 00:36:59.760
more costly because you have to render
 

00:36:59.760 --> 00:37:00.890
more costly because you have to render
your animation first right

00:37:00.890 --> 00:37:00.900
your animation first right
 

00:37:00.900 --> 00:37:02.480
your animation first right
this is pre-rendered animations you

00:37:02.480 --> 00:37:02.490
this is pre-rendered animations you
 

00:37:02.490 --> 00:37:04.609
this is pre-rendered animations you
render it and after effects you take

00:37:04.609 --> 00:37:04.619
render it and after effects you take
 

00:37:04.619 --> 00:37:07.790
render it and after effects you take
your frames from that animation and for

00:37:07.790 --> 00:37:07.800
your frames from that animation and for
 

00:37:07.800 --> 00:37:10.100
your frames from that animation and for
the record about 15 frames as 250

00:37:10.100 --> 00:37:10.110
the record about 15 frames as 250
 

00:37:10.110 --> 00:37:11.540
the record about 15 frames as 250
milliseconds which is what I usually use

00:37:11.540 --> 00:37:11.550
milliseconds which is what I usually use
 

00:37:11.550 --> 00:37:13.820
milliseconds which is what I usually use
for my animations the longer animation

00:37:13.820 --> 00:37:13.830
for my animations the longer animation
 

00:37:13.830 --> 00:37:15.680
for my animations the longer animation
the more frames you're gonna have but

00:37:15.680 --> 00:37:15.690
the more frames you're gonna have but
 

00:37:15.690 --> 00:37:17.000
the more frames you're gonna have but
hopefully your animation is reversible

00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:17.010
hopefully your animation is reversible
 

00:37:17.010 --> 00:37:20.320
hopefully your animation is reversible
so you can reuse these frames in Reverse

00:37:20.320 --> 00:37:20.330
so you can reuse these frames in Reverse
 

00:37:20.330 --> 00:37:22.850
so you can reuse these frames in Reverse
we add all these frames to our animation

00:37:22.850 --> 00:37:22.860
we add all these frames to our animation
 

00:37:22.860 --> 00:37:24.950
we add all these frames to our animation
list right and we set the duration to be

00:37:24.950 --> 00:37:24.960
list right and we set the duration to be
 

00:37:24.960 --> 00:37:27.920
list right and we set the duration to be
16 milliseconds per frame and then we

00:37:27.920 --> 00:37:27.930
16 milliseconds per frame and then we
 

00:37:27.930 --> 00:37:30.080
16 milliseconds per frame and then we
just apply toward goop or whether we

00:37:30.080 --> 00:37:30.090
just apply toward goop or whether we
 

00:37:30.090 --> 00:37:31.460
just apply toward goop or whether we
apply it to our view and we can draw

00:37:31.460 --> 00:37:31.470
apply it to our view and we can draw
 

00:37:31.470 --> 00:37:35.240
apply it to our view and we can draw
these animations to the screen I don't

00:37:35.240 --> 00:37:35.250
these animations to the screen I don't
 

00:37:35.250 --> 00:37:36.770
these animations to the screen I don't
actually have a example for this because

00:37:36.770 --> 00:37:36.780
actually have a example for this because
 

00:37:36.780 --> 00:37:39.109
actually have a example for this because
quite frankly in a talk like this that

00:37:39.109 --> 00:37:39.119
quite frankly in a talk like this that
 

00:37:39.119 --> 00:37:40.520
quite frankly in a talk like this that
would just look like a gif right that

00:37:40.520 --> 00:37:40.530
would just look like a gif right that
 

00:37:40.530 --> 00:37:41.720
would just look like a gif right that
would look like any other animation

00:37:41.720 --> 00:37:41.730
would look like any other animation
 

00:37:41.730 --> 00:37:44.890
would look like any other animation
because it's just you're straight up

00:37:44.890 --> 00:37:44.900
because it's just you're straight up
 

00:37:44.900 --> 00:37:47.510
because it's just you're straight up
what's it called movie like that's how

00:37:47.510 --> 00:37:47.520
what's it called movie like that's how
 

00:37:47.520 --> 00:37:50.780
what's it called movie like that's how
movies work right alright so what if we

00:37:50.780 --> 00:37:50.790
movies work right alright so what if we
 

00:37:50.790 --> 00:37:51.980
movies work right alright so what if we
want to get kind of complicated with

00:37:51.980 --> 00:37:51.990
want to get kind of complicated with
 

00:37:51.990 --> 00:37:54.830
want to get kind of complicated with
this right what if we wanted to actually

00:37:54.830 --> 00:37:54.840
this right what if we wanted to actually
 

00:37:54.840 --> 00:37:58.340
this right what if we wanted to actually
simulate this stuff on the screen as an

00:37:58.340 --> 00:37:58.350
simulate this stuff on the screen as an
 

00:37:58.350 --> 00:38:02.599
simulate this stuff on the screen as an
actual like actual fluid simulation so

00:38:02.599 --> 00:38:02.609
actual like actual fluid simulation so
 

00:38:02.609 --> 00:38:04.580
actual like actual fluid simulation so
usually fluid simulation extremely

00:38:04.580 --> 00:38:04.590
usually fluid simulation extremely
 

00:38:04.590 --> 00:38:08.480
usually fluid simulation extremely
expensive right but even if we could

00:38:08.480 --> 00:38:08.490
expensive right but even if we could
 

00:38:08.490 --> 00:38:10.460
expensive right but even if we could
simulate it right how do we apply that

00:38:10.460 --> 00:38:10.470
simulate it right how do we apply that
 

00:38:10.470 --> 00:38:13.310
simulate it right how do we apply that
to our drawable well we do that using

00:38:13.310 --> 00:38:13.320
to our drawable well we do that using
 

00:38:13.320 --> 00:38:15.590
to our drawable well we do that using
what I call bitmap mesh right so Android

00:38:15.590 --> 00:38:15.600
what I call bitmap mesh right so Android
 

00:38:15.600 --> 00:38:18.410
what I call bitmap mesh right so Android
has this great feature called draw a

00:38:18.410 --> 00:38:18.420
has this great feature called draw a
 

00:38:18.420 --> 00:38:20.630
has this great feature called draw a
bitmap mesh right this is available from

00:38:20.630 --> 00:38:20.640
bitmap mesh right this is available from
 

00:38:20.640 --> 00:38:23.570
bitmap mesh right this is available from
API 1 so this was here from the start

00:38:23.570 --> 00:38:23.580
API 1 so this was here from the start
 

00:38:23.580 --> 00:38:26.000
API 1 so this was here from the start
and the way that it works is you take

00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:26.010
and the way that it works is you take
 

00:38:26.010 --> 00:38:27.830
and the way that it works is you take
your mesh right in the same way that you

00:38:27.830 --> 00:38:27.840
your mesh right in the same way that you
 

00:38:27.840 --> 00:38:30.440
your mesh right in the same way that you
would have an OpenGL mesh square grid

00:38:30.440 --> 00:38:30.450
would have an OpenGL mesh square grid
 

00:38:30.450 --> 00:38:35.090
would have an OpenGL mesh square grid
and you can apply that mesh to a bitmap

00:38:35.090 --> 00:38:35.100
and you can apply that mesh to a bitmap
 

00:38:35.100 --> 00:38:37.250
and you can apply that mesh to a bitmap
and what Android will actually do is

00:38:37.250 --> 00:38:37.260
and what Android will actually do is
 

00:38:37.260 --> 00:38:39.109
and what Android will actually do is
it'll transform your bitmap depending on

00:38:39.109 --> 00:38:39.119
it'll transform your bitmap depending on
 

00:38:39.119 --> 00:38:41.060
it'll transform your bitmap depending on
that mesh so if you take your mesh and

00:38:41.060 --> 00:38:41.070
that mesh so if you take your mesh and
 

00:38:41.070 --> 00:38:42.800
that mesh so if you take your mesh and
you stretch one corner of the mesh all

00:38:42.800 --> 00:38:42.810
you stretch one corner of the mesh all
 

00:38:42.810 --> 00:38:45.530
you stretch one corner of the mesh all
the way out your bitmap will stretch in

00:38:45.530 --> 00:38:45.540
the way out your bitmap will stretch in
 

00:38:45.540 --> 00:38:48.080
the way out your bitmap will stretch in
the same way so we can use this to our

00:38:48.080 --> 00:38:48.090
the same way so we can use this to our
 

00:38:48.090 --> 00:38:48.530
the same way so we can use this to our
advantage

00:38:48.530 --> 00:38:48.540
advantage
 

00:38:48.540 --> 00:38:51.530
advantage
right what if we could use a mesh and

00:38:51.530 --> 00:38:51.540
right what if we could use a mesh and
 

00:38:51.540 --> 00:38:57.170
right what if we could use a mesh and
make it behave like a goo well maybe we

00:38:57.170 --> 00:38:57.180
make it behave like a goo well maybe we
 

00:38:57.180 --> 00:39:01.340
make it behave like a goo well maybe we
can right so this is exactly what I'm

00:39:01.340 --> 00:39:01.350
can right so this is exactly what I'm
 

00:39:01.350 --> 00:39:01.970
can right so this is exactly what I'm
talking about

00:39:01.970 --> 00:39:01.980
talking about
 

00:39:01.980 --> 00:39:02.460
talking about
we have

00:39:02.460 --> 00:39:02.470
we have
 

00:39:02.470 --> 00:39:05.370
we have
mesh we made its Emilia coupe and we

00:39:05.370 --> 00:39:05.380
mesh we made its Emilia coupe and we
 

00:39:05.380 --> 00:39:07.560
mesh we made its Emilia coupe and we
applied it to our bitmap so up on the

00:39:07.560 --> 00:39:07.570
applied it to our bitmap so up on the
 

00:39:07.570 --> 00:39:08.609
applied it to our bitmap so up on the
top screen this is what it looks like

00:39:08.609 --> 00:39:08.619
top screen this is what it looks like
 

00:39:08.619 --> 00:39:09.930
top screen this is what it looks like
without the mesh and underneath I show

00:39:09.930 --> 00:39:09.940
without the mesh and underneath I show
 

00:39:09.940 --> 00:39:11.400
without the mesh and underneath I show
you what the mesh actually looks like so

00:39:11.400 --> 00:39:11.410
you what the mesh actually looks like so
 

00:39:11.410 --> 00:39:12.690
you what the mesh actually looks like so
what Android is actually doing is it's

00:39:12.690 --> 00:39:12.700
what Android is actually doing is it's
 

00:39:12.700 --> 00:39:15.060
what Android is actually doing is it's
deforming that circle bitmap which in

00:39:15.060 --> 00:39:15.070
deforming that circle bitmap which in
 

00:39:15.070 --> 00:39:16.740
deforming that circle bitmap which in
this case is actually just a circle

00:39:16.740 --> 00:39:16.750
this case is actually just a circle
 

00:39:16.750 --> 00:39:19.710
this case is actually just a circle
drawable and it's deforming it in the

00:39:19.710 --> 00:39:19.720
drawable and it's deforming it in the
 

00:39:19.720 --> 00:39:23.180
drawable and it's deforming it in the
way that that mesh indicates all right

00:39:23.180 --> 00:39:23.190
way that that mesh indicates all right
 

00:39:23.190 --> 00:39:27.180
way that that mesh indicates all right
so turns out that's actually pretty

00:39:27.180 --> 00:39:27.190
so turns out that's actually pretty
 

00:39:27.190 --> 00:39:29.760
so turns out that's actually pretty
simple and if we take an optimized

00:39:29.760 --> 00:39:29.770
simple and if we take an optimized
 

00:39:29.770 --> 00:39:32.180
simple and if we take an optimized
physics simulation that kind of is

00:39:32.180 --> 00:39:32.190
physics simulation that kind of is
 

00:39:32.190 --> 00:39:34.410
physics simulation that kind of is
optimized for this rebounding animation

00:39:34.410 --> 00:39:34.420
optimized for this rebounding animation
 

00:39:34.420 --> 00:39:36.270
optimized for this rebounding animation
and this deforming we can kind of

00:39:36.270 --> 00:39:36.280
and this deforming we can kind of
 

00:39:36.280 --> 00:39:39.000
and this deforming we can kind of
simulate this stuff right so we just

00:39:39.000 --> 00:39:39.010
simulate this stuff right so we just
 

00:39:39.010 --> 00:39:41.520
simulate this stuff right so we just
render a drawable to a bitmap right so

00:39:41.520 --> 00:39:41.530
render a drawable to a bitmap right so
 

00:39:41.530 --> 00:39:43.680
render a drawable to a bitmap right so
we can take any view any button anything

00:39:43.680 --> 00:39:43.690
we can take any view any button anything
 

00:39:43.690 --> 00:39:45.450
we can take any view any button anything
that we actually want to do render it to

00:39:45.450 --> 00:39:45.460
that we actually want to do render it to
 

00:39:45.460 --> 00:39:48.180
that we actually want to do render it to
a bitmap deform the mesh that we draw

00:39:48.180 --> 00:39:48.190
a bitmap deform the mesh that we draw
 

00:39:48.190 --> 00:39:50.370
a bitmap deform the mesh that we draw
underneath that bitmap Android pipes all

00:39:50.370 --> 00:39:50.380
underneath that bitmap Android pipes all
 

00:39:50.380 --> 00:39:53.280
underneath that bitmap Android pipes all
of that down by the way that bitmap mesh

00:39:53.280 --> 00:39:53.290
of that down by the way that bitmap mesh
 

00:39:53.290 --> 00:39:55.500
of that down by the way that bitmap mesh
is really really fast that goes straight

00:39:55.500 --> 00:39:55.510
is really really fast that goes straight
 

00:39:55.510 --> 00:39:58.980

OpenGL because what Android does under
 

00:40:00.700 --> 00:40:02.460
OpenGL because what Android does under
the hood is it just creates that mesh as

00:40:02.460 --> 00:40:02.470
the hood is it just creates that mesh as
 

00:40:02.470 --> 00:40:04.320
the hood is it just creates that mesh as
an actual mesh and then draws the bitmap

00:40:04.320 --> 00:40:04.330
an actual mesh and then draws the bitmap
 

00:40:04.330 --> 00:40:05.700
an actual mesh and then draws the bitmap
over it as a texture in the same way

00:40:05.700 --> 00:40:05.710
over it as a texture in the same way
 

00:40:05.710 --> 00:40:07.560

that a 3d game would that's really

00:40:07.560 --> 00:40:07.570
that a 3d game would that's really
 

00:40:07.570 --> 00:40:09.660
that a 3d game would that's really
really fast and like I said this is

00:40:09.660 --> 00:40:09.670
really fast and like I said this is
 

00:40:09.670 --> 00:40:11.970

00:40:14.670 --> 00:40:14.680
something like a nexus one or a t-mobile

g1 or whatever it came before that right

00:40:18.839 --> 00:40:18.849
g1 or whatever it came before that right
 

00:40:18.849 --> 00:40:20.220
g1 or whatever it came before that right
and then we can render that bitmap to a

00:40:20.220 --> 00:40:20.230
and then we can render that bitmap to a
 

00:40:20.230 --> 00:40:22.140
and then we can render that bitmap to a
canvas and then we can actually draw

00:40:22.140 --> 00:40:22.150
canvas and then we can actually draw
 

00:40:22.150 --> 00:40:26.780
canvas and then we can actually draw
that canvas as our view underneath it so

00:40:26.780 --> 00:40:26.790
that canvas as our view underneath it so
 

00:40:26.790 --> 00:40:31.140
that canvas as our view underneath it so
that's where this comes in GUI bits so

00:40:31.140 --> 00:40:31.150
that's where this comes in GUI bits so
 

00:40:31.150 --> 00:40:32.040
that's where this comes in GUI bits so
I've started working on something like

00:40:32.040 --> 00:40:32.050
I've started working on something like
 

00:40:32.050 --> 00:40:33.930
I've started working on something like
this in fact the animation that you saw

you guys have kind of download this and

00:41:01.650 --> 00:41:01.660
you guys have kind of download this and
 

00:41:01.660 --> 00:41:04.440
you guys have kind of download this and
you can check it out and play with it a

00:41:04.440 --> 00:41:04.450
you can check it out and play with it a
 

00:41:04.450 --> 00:41:06.480
you can check it out and play with it a
little bit but it does work and it works

00:41:06.480 --> 00:41:06.490
little bit but it does work and it works
 

00:41:06.490 --> 00:41:08.970
little bit but it does work and it works
really well the fluid simulation part of

really well the fluid simulation part of
 

00:41:08.980 --> 00:41:11.010
really well the fluid simulation part of
this is actually already finished at

so at this point all I'm really

00:41:16.440 --> 00:41:16.450
so at this point all I'm really
 

00:41:16.450 --> 00:41:18.089

is just trying to get all of the

00:41:18.089 --> 00:41:18.099

is just trying to get all of the
different behaviors that you would

00:41:19.109 --> 00:41:19.119
different behaviors that you would
 

00:41:19.119 --> 00:41:21.809
different behaviors that you would
expect from a piece of goo to draw into

00:41:21.809 --> 00:41:21.819
expect from a piece of goo to draw into
 

00:41:21.819 --> 00:41:23.519

this mesh and then apply that mesh to

00:41:23.519 --> 00:41:23.529
this mesh and then apply that mesh to
 

00:41:23.529 --> 00:41:25.109
this mesh and then apply that mesh to
your bitmaps and then move that mesh

00:41:25.109 --> 00:41:25.119
your bitmaps and then move that mesh
 

00:41:25.119 --> 00:41:26.250
your bitmaps and then move that mesh
around in the way that you would expect

00:41:26.250 --> 00:41:26.260
around in the way that you would expect
 

00:41:26.260 --> 00:41:29.309
around in the way that you would expect
goop so I expect to be able to be able

00:41:29.309 --> 00:41:29.319
goop so I expect to be able to be able
 

00:41:29.319 --> 00:41:31.259
goop so I expect to be able to be able
to rip apart two pieces of goop and have

00:41:31.259 --> 00:41:31.269
to rip apart two pieces of goop and have
 

00:41:31.269 --> 00:41:37.470
to rip apart two pieces of goop and have
two separate pieces of goop so oh I

00:41:37.470 --> 00:41:37.480
two separate pieces of goop so oh I
 

00:41:37.480 --> 00:41:41.640
two separate pieces of goop so oh I
guess that's twice in there all right

00:41:41.640 --> 00:41:41.650
guess that's twice in there all right
 

00:41:41.650 --> 00:41:44.130
guess that's twice in there all right
cool so this is like the bleeding edge

00:41:44.130 --> 00:41:44.140

00:41:50.410 --> 00:41:52.950
seriously propagated throughout the
design space but I see this as kind of

00:41:52.950 --> 00:41:52.960
design space but I see this as kind of
 

00:41:52.960 --> 00:41:55.109
