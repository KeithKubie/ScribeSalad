00:00:40.172 --> 00:00:42.775 size:75% position:38%
FROM THE TRENCH MOUTH...

00:00:42.808 --> 00:00:45.411 size:84% position:42%
HE'S PROBABLY A NICE GUY...

00:00:45.444 --> 00:00:48.781 align:start position:0%
(CHUCKLES)
HE'S RECOVERED FROM THE TRENCH

00:00:48.814 --> 00:00:50.950 align:start position:0%
MOUTH HE CONTRACTED WHILE
HUNTING PANDAS WITH HIS HOMEMADE

00:00:50.983 --> 00:00:54.220 align:start position:0%
FLAMETHROWER TO DEFEND DONALD
TRUMP.

00:00:54.253 --> 00:00:56.722 size:84% position:42%
HE TOLD WIBX RADIO WHAT HE
THINKS OF REPUBLICAN DEBATE

00:00:56.755 --> 00:01:01.494
MODERATOR MEGYN KELLY, WHO WENT
AFTER TRUMP FOR SEXIST REMARKS,

00:01:01.527 --> 00:01:03.796
SAYING, "I OFTEN JUST TURN ON
FOX TO LOOK AT HER, SOMETIMES

00:01:03.829 --> 00:01:05.364
WHEN I'M LOADING MY MAGAZINES.

00:01:05.397 --> 00:01:08.501
AND I USUALLY SIT NAKED ON THE
COUCH, DROPPING HOT BRASS ON MY

00:01:08.534 --> 00:01:11.237 align:start position:0%
STUFF."

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.804 align:start position:0%
I WAS RIGHT.

00:01:11.837 --> 00:01:14.841 size:75% position:38%
HE'S A PIECE OF (BLEEP).

00:01:14.874 --> 00:01:20.680
THAT SOUNDS LIKE A LINE FROM HIS
EROTIC NOVEL, 50 NECKS OF RED.

00:01:20.713 --> 00:01:24.150 align:start position:0%
THIS...

00:01:24.183 --> 00:01:26.953
THIS WHOLE INCIDENT DEFIES MATH
BECAUSE TRUMP AND NUGENT ARE

00:01:26.986 --> 00:01:29.856 align:start position:0%
NEGATIVE AND THAT SHOULD EQUAL A
POSITIVE, BUT, IN REALITY, IT

00:01:29.889 --> 00:01:32.492 align:start position:0%
JUST CREATES A DOUCHEBAG BLACK
HOLE.

00:01:32.525 --> 00:01:35.928
SO, COMEDIANS, NOW THAT WE KNOW
THE NUGE WATCHES FOX NAKED WHILE

00:01:35.961 --> 00:01:39.198 align:start position:0%
