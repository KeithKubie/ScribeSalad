[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:06.391
MO FONG: Hi.

00:00:06.391 --> 00:00:06.890
Hi.

00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:09.570
Thank you so much
for coming today.

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:10.400
My name is Mo Fong.

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:11.810
This is Randy Reyes.

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:13.940
And we are here to help you--

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:15.900
go up to the stage,
we've been told.

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:16.560
OK.

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:18.250
To the stage.

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:18.830
Better?

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:19.700
OK.

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:20.251
Awesome.

00:00:20.251 --> 00:00:20.750
Hi.

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:21.650
I'm Mo Fong.

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:24.260
And I'm a director for
K-12 education outreach

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:25.490
here at Google.

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:28.460
And it is my honor
to be here to host

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:33.560
this panel of national leaders
and experts and race experts

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:37.820
as well to talk about Bamboo
Ceilings, Minority Myths,

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:41.100
and also just to help educate
around the Asian community.

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.220
So this has been a
long time in coming.

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:46.970
I've been at Google for 10
years, seven in finance,

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:48.810
three in comps, and
now in engineering,

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:50.120
doing education work.

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:53.210
And so I've seen this
community evolve over time.

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:54.860
And it's wonderful
to see that we are

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:57.510
all part of this conversation.

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.390
This is part of the
Decoding Race series

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:01.790
which the Race At Google
team has been preparing

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:04.160
for over the last few quarters.

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:06.140
There have been nine
different panels

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:09.440
talking about various aspects
around the race discussion.

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:12.200
And so this is the first
time that the Asian community

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:15.160
has come together to talk
about what it means for us.

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:16.910
I'm particularly excited
about this panel,

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:19.040
not just because
I'm Asian American

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:23.180
but because this is a community
of people who really want

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:26.030
to understand and educate
one another about how we can

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:30.680
collectively improve
relationships across the aisle,

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:34.670
across different groups, so that
we can make progress together.

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:37.820
My first experience with race
was when I was really young.

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:41.150
I immigrated from
Taiwan when I was five.

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:44.800
And I literally was the only
Asian, other than my sister,

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:47.090
in our elementary
school in Michigan.

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:49.910
And so to feel like an
outlier in those situations,

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:52.580
I mean I think it was really
early on that I realized

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:54.860
gosh one of us doesn't
look like the other

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:56.460
and what does that mean.

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:58.970
And then my parents
came to California

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:01.024
and there was a
lot more diversity.

00:02:01.024 --> 00:02:02.690
And then I started
teaching high school.

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:03.320
And it was interesting.

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:05.695
I've had these conversations
with my high school students

00:02:05.695 --> 00:02:06.380
as well.

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:09.050
And I taught in
Cupertino at Monte Vista.

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:12.470
And it was about
60% Asian back then.

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:14.600
I think it's now up
to like 70% Asian.

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:16.970
And the students will
be the first to tell you

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:18.620
Asia is not a country.

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:20.750
There are a lot of
different types of Asians.

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:23.280
We don't all experience
the same things.

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:25.220
And so they were trying
to educate each other

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:26.730
about their cultures as well.

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:29.340
So I'm hoping some of
that will come out today.

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:31.609
But definitely, welcome
all the conversations

00:02:31.609 --> 00:02:32.650
we're going to be having.

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:34.400
So it's a dialogue.

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:36.680
And I hope this dialogue
continues even after today.

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:38.287
So thank you all
again for being here.

00:02:38.287 --> 00:02:39.870
And I'm going to
turn it over to Randy

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:41.204
to talk to you about the panel.

00:02:41.204 --> 00:02:41.870
RANDY REYES: Hi.

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:42.911
Thanks, Mo.

00:02:42.911 --> 00:02:43.910
Good morning, everybody.

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:46.130
I'm Randy Reyes from
the Diversity Team.

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:49.580
I'm the client adviser for
the Asian Google network,

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:52.760
the Filipino Google network,
the Indus Google network,

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:55.280
and the Google American
Indian network.

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:57.650
And I'm also part of the
large planning team that

00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:59.210
helped put this panel together.

00:02:59.210 --> 00:03:02.450
I'm personally excited
about this particular panel

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:04.280
and our panelists,
because I feel

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:07.520
like in the context of
race, a lot of the times,

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:09.470
Asian gets overlooked.

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:12.200
And when it's actually
included in the conversation,

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:15.410
the diversity that exists
within our Asian category

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:18.350
isn't necessarily
unpacked or talked about.

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:20.990
So I'm super excited to hear
the conversation and what's

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:23.750
to emerge.

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:25.850
Before I passed it
over to Lorrie Ma, who

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:28.850
is our awesome moderator, as
well as to the wonderful panel,

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:30.920
I have four reminders
for you all.

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:32.900
The first is that
it's being recorded.

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:34.730
The second, it's
going on YouTube.

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:38.570
The third, do not post to social
media until it goes public.

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:41.540
And the last is if you guys
have questions for the panel,

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:45.080
those on live stream or people
sitting in the audience that

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:51.200
don't feel comfortable going to
the mic, go/decodingrace-dory,

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:54.054
D-O-R-Y, is where you
can post questions.

00:03:54.054 --> 00:03:55.970
And with that, I'll pass
it to Laurie, thanks.

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:57.461
[APPLAUSE]

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:03.910
LORRIE MA: Hi, guys.

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:04.930
My name is Lorrie.

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:08.710
And for my day job, I am a
program manager in privacy

00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:09.340
here.

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:14.620
And as my 20%, or as some
people like to say 150%,

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:17.680
I am the co-lead for
Asian Google network.

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:20.620
And so I am very excited to be
moderating this panel today.

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:23.754
And instead of reading
off their bios, which

00:04:23.754 --> 00:04:26.170
I'm sure you guys have all
received in the multiple emails

00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:27.850
that we sent out,
I would actually

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:30.400
love the panelists to
introduce themselves.

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:33.017
So I will start from my right.

00:04:33.017 --> 00:04:34.475
QUYEN DINH: Good
morning, everyone.

00:04:34.475 --> 00:04:35.660
Is this working?

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:36.530
Great.

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:37.660
My name is Quyen Dinh.

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:40.552
I am from San Jose.

00:04:40.552 --> 00:04:41.920
So I grew up in the Bay Area.

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:43.540
I went to Cal for my undergrad.

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:45.340
And I'm currently the
Executive Director

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:48.250
of SEARAC, the Southeast
Asia Resource Action Center.

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:51.110
We're based in Washington DC
with an office in Sacramento,

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:51.790
California.

00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:53.470
And I'm so excited
to be here today.

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:55.424
Thank you.

00:04:55.424 --> 00:04:56.590
VALARIE KAUR: Hi, everybody.

00:04:56.590 --> 00:04:57.900
My name is Valarie Kaur.

00:04:57.900 --> 00:04:59.640
I am a Sikh American.

00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:01.770
I'm a South Asian
American activist.

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:03.720
I've been doing this
work for about 15 years

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:06.405
as a civil rights lawyer,
filmmaker, organizer.

00:05:06.405 --> 00:05:09.030
Right now I run something called
the Revolutionary Love Project

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:12.600
at USC to equip people to
fight for social justice

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:15.592
through the ethic of love.

00:05:15.592 --> 00:05:16.550
PHIL YU: Hi, everybody.

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:17.540
Good morning.

00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:18.450
My name is Phil Yu.

00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:22.900
I run a blog called
Angry Asian Man which

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:27.190
is a blog that covers Asian
American issues, news,

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:29.860
perspectives, pop
culture, politics.

00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:34.587
I've been running it for 16
years, which is like insane.

00:05:34.587 --> 00:05:35.920
I am glad to be back in the Bay.

00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:36.950
I grew up in Sunnyvale.

00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:38.200
Went to Homestead High School.

00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:39.460
My folks still live here.

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:42.190
So it's good to be back.

00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:42.755
Thanks.

00:05:42.755 --> 00:05:43.630
LORRIE MA: All right.

00:05:43.630 --> 00:05:45.504
Let's give our panelists
a round of applause.

00:05:45.504 --> 00:05:46.831
[APPLAUSE]

00:05:49.170 --> 00:05:53.339
So without further ado, let's
get the conversation started.

00:05:53.339 --> 00:05:55.380
And just a reminder, what
we're trying to do here

00:05:55.380 --> 00:05:57.480
is to have healthy
dialogue around race.

00:05:57.480 --> 00:05:59.520
And something that's,
for some reason,

00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:01.080
fairly difficult for Asians.

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:04.410
So you know when you think
about Asian, none of us

00:06:04.410 --> 00:06:06.614
really identify
ourselves as Asian.

00:06:06.614 --> 00:06:08.530
You know, I don't go
around saying I am Asian.

00:06:08.530 --> 00:06:10.500
I go around saying I am Chinese.

00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:12.420
So we inherently
have this problem

00:06:12.420 --> 00:06:15.090
where Asian is just made up
of so many different things

00:06:15.090 --> 00:06:17.950
that race affects
us very differently.

00:06:17.950 --> 00:06:21.180
So I want to pose this question
to our panelists of when

00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:25.110
did you realize that
race was a thing for you?

00:06:25.110 --> 00:06:27.240
And how did it affect you?

00:06:30.350 --> 00:06:32.432
Anyone feel free to start?

00:06:32.432 --> 00:06:33.640
PHIL YU: I guess I can start.

00:06:33.640 --> 00:06:35.780
So I'm Korean American.

00:06:35.780 --> 00:06:38.897
My parents immigrated
from Korea in the '70s.

00:06:38.897 --> 00:06:39.980
I grew up here in the Bay.

00:06:39.980 --> 00:06:42.380
And things are like--
there's like there's

00:06:42.380 --> 00:06:43.940
hella Asians in the Bay now.

00:06:43.940 --> 00:06:47.390
But when I was growing up,
there were quite a few as well.

00:06:47.390 --> 00:06:48.140
It was growing.

00:06:48.140 --> 00:06:51.210
But there weren't as many
Koreans where I was growing up.

00:06:51.210 --> 00:06:53.090
It's very different now.

00:06:53.090 --> 00:06:57.830
But I think for the most part,
most of my life growing up I

00:06:57.830 --> 00:07:00.710
mean, I considered
myself Korean American.

00:07:00.710 --> 00:07:02.030
I knew I was Asian.

00:07:02.030 --> 00:07:04.550
When you looked
like this, people

00:07:04.550 --> 00:07:06.260
assume that you are Asian.

00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:11.960
But it was kind of just like
a category you checked off.

00:07:11.960 --> 00:07:14.900
I was, for the most,
I was Korean American

00:07:14.900 --> 00:07:16.070
and whatever that means.

00:07:16.070 --> 00:07:23.370
For me, I actually went to
college at Northwestern.

00:07:23.370 --> 00:07:26.410
And being plucked from the
Bay Area to the Midwest

00:07:26.410 --> 00:07:28.439
was a bit of a
culture shock for me.

00:07:28.439 --> 00:07:30.230
A lot of things I took
for granted in terms

00:07:30.230 --> 00:07:32.074
of being with community.

00:07:32.074 --> 00:07:33.740
Stuff that I hadn't
really thought about

00:07:33.740 --> 00:07:35.840
before in terms of
being with a larger

00:07:35.840 --> 00:07:37.160
Asian American community.

00:07:37.160 --> 00:07:40.160
It suddenly became
very obvious to me

00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:43.640
the things that I took for
granted in terms of the way

00:07:43.640 --> 00:07:45.740
you interact with one another.

00:07:45.740 --> 00:07:52.160
And I look very different
from the people in my classes,

00:07:52.160 --> 00:07:55.640
You and my interests are,
and what I grew up with,

00:07:55.640 --> 00:07:58.646
these are very sort of
typical things I think.

00:07:58.646 --> 00:08:00.020
So it was a bit
of culture shock.

00:08:00.020 --> 00:08:02.311
And then the other thing was
that I took Asian American

00:08:02.311 --> 00:08:07.010
Studies courses in college,
which was just like for me,

00:08:07.010 --> 00:08:10.340
it was the beginning of a
lot of different things.

00:08:10.340 --> 00:08:14.930
It was a wake up call
in terms of my adapting

00:08:14.930 --> 00:08:17.157
Asian American as a
political identity.

00:08:17.157 --> 00:08:18.740
Not just something
that I checked off,

00:08:18.740 --> 00:08:24.276
but something I purposely
wore on my sleeve.

00:08:24.276 --> 00:08:25.400
So now when people ask me--

00:08:25.400 --> 00:08:27.750
I mean like it's clear
I'm like I'm Asian.

00:08:27.750 --> 00:08:31.650
But I'm usually asked, I'm
usually I'm Asian American.

00:08:31.650 --> 00:08:34.070
And then the other identity
is Korean American.

00:08:34.070 --> 00:08:36.860
But as a political identity,
what I wear on my sleeve,

00:08:36.860 --> 00:08:38.419
it's definitely Asian American.

00:08:38.419 --> 00:08:41.210
And it's very purposeful
when I say that.

00:08:41.210 --> 00:08:44.570
Because I mean we've
already touched upon this,

00:08:44.570 --> 00:08:46.880
but like I think a lot
of people don't realize

00:08:46.880 --> 00:08:50.000
they're Asian until
they get to like to--

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:53.180
in Asia, nobody really
considers themselves Asian.

00:08:53.180 --> 00:08:55.499
You're your own
whatever nationality

00:08:55.499 --> 00:08:56.540
where ever you come from.

00:08:56.540 --> 00:08:59.644
But when you come to
America, and a lot of people

00:08:59.644 --> 00:09:02.060
immigrate here, and suddenly
like this is thrust upon you.

00:09:02.060 --> 00:09:03.750
You're Asian whether
you like it or not.

00:09:03.750 --> 00:09:08.930
And so however you embrace
that, it's up to you.

00:09:08.930 --> 00:09:10.490
So when you get
here, a lot of people

00:09:10.490 --> 00:09:14.330
are still resistant to
the idea of being Asian.

00:09:14.330 --> 00:09:20.900
But I think that as
an organizing tool,

00:09:20.900 --> 00:09:25.730
Asian is a super inconvenient
convenient unwieldy term

00:09:25.730 --> 00:09:29.000
for a lot of different groups
and people, but very necessary.

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:32.300
And so that's sort of, at
least from the beginning

00:09:32.300 --> 00:09:34.490
of my journey in college
when I sort of became aware

00:09:34.490 --> 00:09:40.010
as my history and my
identity, I think,

00:09:40.010 --> 00:09:42.300
where I wanted to-
and I decided--

00:09:42.300 --> 00:09:43.430
that's the thing.

00:09:43.430 --> 00:09:46.780
Being Asian, I think is Asian
American, it's an opt in.

00:09:46.780 --> 00:09:47.780
It's an opt in identity.

00:09:47.780 --> 00:09:49.400
You have to opt in to
being Asian American.

00:09:49.400 --> 00:09:51.800
You can go on being Chinese
American, Korean American,

00:09:51.800 --> 00:09:53.610
or whatever.

00:09:53.610 --> 00:09:58.820
But I think that you have to
choose to be Asian American.

00:09:58.820 --> 00:10:01.640
VALARIE KAUR: Well, race
first came alive to me

00:10:01.640 --> 00:10:04.070
through the stories
I grew up with.

00:10:04.070 --> 00:10:07.880
So my grandfather sailed on a
Japanese steamship, the Nippon

00:10:07.880 --> 00:10:11.750
Maru, across the
Pacific Ocean in 1913.

00:10:11.750 --> 00:10:13.260
He arrived in San Francisco.

00:10:13.260 --> 00:10:17.017
He was one of the first early
pioneers from South Asia.

00:10:17.017 --> 00:10:19.100
He was a Sikh American
wearing a turban and beard.

00:10:19.100 --> 00:10:21.950
And immigration officials
saw him on Angel Island

00:10:21.950 --> 00:10:24.650
and immediately
incarcerated him.

00:10:24.650 --> 00:10:28.340
Said there was no need for
his class of labor here.

00:10:28.340 --> 00:10:32.060
And I actually cited prejudice
against his class of laborer

00:10:32.060 --> 00:10:34.530
for exhibiting
prejudice against him.

00:10:34.530 --> 00:10:38.480
So he was incarcerated
for months on end.

00:10:38.480 --> 00:10:41.420
And it was a white
lawyer, Henry Marshall,

00:10:41.420 --> 00:10:44.300
who released him on a
writ of habeas corpus

00:10:44.300 --> 00:10:47.900
on Christmas Eve 1913.

00:10:47.900 --> 00:10:50.180
My grandfather made
his way down the valley

00:10:50.180 --> 00:10:52.880
and he settled in Clovis,
which is near Fresno,

00:10:52.880 --> 00:10:55.190
just a few hours south of here.

00:10:55.190 --> 00:10:59.720
And I think something
about understanding the way

00:10:59.720 --> 00:11:03.710
that that act of solidarity
set him free showed him what

00:11:03.710 --> 00:11:05.120
it meant to be an American.

00:11:05.120 --> 00:11:07.430
So when his Japanese
American neighbors were then

00:11:07.430 --> 00:11:09.800
rounded up and taken
to concentration camps

00:11:09.800 --> 00:11:12.920
during World War II,
he was one of the few

00:11:12.920 --> 00:11:14.420
who hooked up his
horse and buggy

00:11:14.420 --> 00:11:17.720
and traveled to the deserts of
post in Arizona to visit them.

00:11:17.720 --> 00:11:19.730
He looks after
their farms and made

00:11:19.730 --> 00:11:22.310
sure they were safe
for when they returned.

00:11:22.310 --> 00:11:24.290
And so, growing up
with these stories,

00:11:24.290 --> 00:11:26.930
we still had like that piece of
petrified rock my grandfather

00:11:26.930 --> 00:11:29.665
found on that camp
sitting on our fireplace.

00:11:29.665 --> 00:11:31.040
So growing up with
these stories,

00:11:31.040 --> 00:11:32.956
I understood, just like
as Phil has mentioned,

00:11:32.956 --> 00:11:36.350
that growing up as Asian
American is an opt in.

00:11:36.350 --> 00:11:39.080
That my grandfather showed
me that saying that you're

00:11:39.080 --> 00:11:41.402
Asian American is actually
an act of solidarity,

00:11:41.402 --> 00:11:42.860
that I will stand
with you brother,

00:11:42.860 --> 00:11:45.980
I will stand with you sister,
even if we are read differently

00:11:45.980 --> 00:11:47.720
by the dominant culture.

00:11:47.720 --> 00:11:50.480
We are in this together.

00:11:50.480 --> 00:11:52.400
I think race is a construct.

00:11:52.400 --> 00:11:54.080
But it's important
to think of it

00:11:54.080 --> 00:11:58.070
as a cage that determines
how other people see us

00:11:58.070 --> 00:12:00.320
and how the state treats us.

00:12:00.320 --> 00:12:03.110
And so when my grandfather first
arrived, the cage we were under

00:12:03.110 --> 00:12:04.280
was Hindu.

00:12:04.280 --> 00:12:06.140
And that wasn't even
a racial category.

00:12:06.140 --> 00:12:07.790
It was a religious
identification

00:12:07.790 --> 00:12:10.790
that didn't even align with my
grandfather's Sikh identity.

00:12:10.790 --> 00:12:13.460
So we were called Hindus
when we first arrived.

00:12:13.460 --> 00:12:16.670
And then on census
forms, Hindus or other.

00:12:16.670 --> 00:12:18.620
And then under the
Asian Exclusion Acts,

00:12:18.620 --> 00:12:21.860
we, along with our Chinese,
Japanese American brothers

00:12:21.860 --> 00:12:25.250
and sisters were not allowed
to become citizens because we

00:12:25.250 --> 00:12:27.050
weren't Caucasian or white.

00:12:27.050 --> 00:12:28.420
We weren't allowed to own land.

00:12:28.420 --> 00:12:30.420
And we weren't allowed
to return to this country

00:12:30.420 --> 00:12:31.700
if we ever left.

00:12:31.700 --> 00:12:34.490
There was a counterpart of my
grandfather's, Bhagat Singh

00:12:34.490 --> 00:12:38.690
Thind, who, in 1923, took a
case all the way to the Supreme

00:12:38.690 --> 00:12:42.170
Court arguing that actually
South Asian American are

00:12:42.170 --> 00:12:43.520
Caucasian.

00:12:43.520 --> 00:12:45.920
And the Supreme Court said,
well, certainly our founders

00:12:45.920 --> 00:12:49.250
did not mean for you to
be on the same platform

00:12:49.250 --> 00:12:52.580
as a white Scandinavian,
a blond Scandinavian.

00:12:52.580 --> 00:12:56.120
And so you are denied
citizenship along

00:12:56.120 --> 00:12:58.580
with other Asian Americans.

00:12:58.580 --> 00:13:01.929
So see how the concept of race
has shifted over the time.

00:13:01.929 --> 00:13:03.470
And so growing up
with these stories,

00:13:03.470 --> 00:13:06.350
I understood that this is
something that's imposed on us.

00:13:06.350 --> 00:13:10.190
That it's a cage that
we are operating under.

00:13:10.190 --> 00:13:13.430
I, myself, did not
experience it until I

00:13:13.430 --> 00:13:16.010
was a kid in elementary school.

00:13:16.010 --> 00:13:18.560
I was playing house
in the school yard

00:13:18.560 --> 00:13:21.320
on my knees pretending to be a
baby, when a little boy ran up

00:13:21.320 --> 00:13:23.610
to me and said get
up you black dog.

00:13:23.610 --> 00:13:26.060
So here we are, a
family who's been called

00:13:26.060 --> 00:13:30.110
Hindu, other, Caucasian,
Asian, and now blackness

00:13:30.110 --> 00:13:33.170
is something we have taken
on as the word, the N-word,

00:13:33.170 --> 00:13:37.280
and then Sand-N-word has
now been thrust upon us.

00:13:37.280 --> 00:13:40.730
I did not understand the
danger and the violence

00:13:40.730 --> 00:13:43.580
that racial constructs can
wield in our communities

00:13:43.580 --> 00:13:45.500
until September 11th.

00:13:45.500 --> 00:13:46.970
I was a 20-year-old college kid.

00:13:46.970 --> 00:13:49.520
I was here at Stanford.

00:13:49.520 --> 00:13:51.380
In the wake of the
terrorist attacks,

00:13:51.380 --> 00:13:54.530
hate violence erupted on city
streets across this country.

00:13:54.530 --> 00:13:56.400
Four days later,
Balbir Singh Sodhi,

00:13:56.400 --> 00:13:58.730
who was a Sikh American
man, who was standing

00:13:58.730 --> 00:14:01.040
in front of his store
in Mesa, Arizona

00:14:01.040 --> 00:14:04.400
when a man wheeled around the
corner and shot him four times,

00:14:04.400 --> 00:14:07.190
called himself a patriot
when he was arrested.

00:14:07.190 --> 00:14:09.050
Balbir Uncle was
someone my family knew.

00:14:09.050 --> 00:14:11.750
So I felt as though an
uncle had been murdered.

00:14:11.750 --> 00:14:14.540
And his murder barely
made the evening news.

00:14:14.540 --> 00:14:16.460
This was before Google.

00:14:16.460 --> 00:14:18.500
This was before
Facebook, before YouTube,

00:14:18.500 --> 00:14:22.190
before Twitter, before we had
any modes of communication.

00:14:22.190 --> 00:14:24.920
And so the desperation
of understanding

00:14:24.920 --> 00:14:27.500
that a century of
being in this country,

00:14:27.500 --> 00:14:31.070
we were still being read as
perpetually foreign, and now,

00:14:31.070 --> 00:14:32.630
and now, as terrorist.

00:14:32.630 --> 00:14:35.630
Because what's happened in
the years since September 11th

00:14:35.630 --> 00:14:38.600
is that a new racial
category has been formed,

00:14:38.600 --> 00:14:41.240
the racial category of
the Muslim terrorist.

00:14:41.240 --> 00:14:44.030
And Muslims are in that
category, brown Muslims,

00:14:44.030 --> 00:14:50.630
black Muslims, Sikh Indians,
white Sikhs, Arab Christians,

00:14:50.630 --> 00:14:52.880
Latinos with beards,
Native Americans

00:14:52.880 --> 00:14:56.450
have been killed in the name of
going back to their country out

00:14:56.450 --> 00:14:57.350
of Islamophobia.

00:14:57.350 --> 00:15:01.510
So this construct now is so
enormous that it cages so many

00:15:01.510 --> 00:15:02.650
of us.

00:15:02.650 --> 00:15:05.020
And my heartbreak
at this moment is

00:15:05.020 --> 00:15:07.930
that I thought that Balbir
Uncle's murder may turn me

00:15:07.930 --> 00:15:09.940
into an activist for 15 years.

00:15:09.940 --> 00:15:13.237
Every film, every lawsuit,
every social media campaign,

00:15:13.237 --> 00:15:15.070
I thought we were making
the country a safer

00:15:15.070 --> 00:15:17.530
place for the next generation.

00:15:17.530 --> 00:15:19.600
My son is born.

00:15:19.600 --> 00:15:21.360
He's two years old.

00:15:21.360 --> 00:15:23.792
And he's growing
up now in an era

00:15:23.792 --> 00:15:25.750
that the Southern Poverty
Law Center has called

00:15:25.750 --> 00:15:27.580
the era of enormous rage.

00:15:27.580 --> 00:15:29.470
Hate crimes are
skyrocketing once again,

00:15:29.470 --> 00:15:32.200
rivaling the numbers
that we saw after 9/11.

00:15:32.200 --> 00:15:34.060
Hate groups have
increased in this country.

00:15:34.060 --> 00:15:37.660
Anti-Muslim hate groups have
tripled in the last year.

00:15:37.660 --> 00:15:40.910
And the current
president is releasing

00:15:40.910 --> 00:15:44.400
an onslaught of executive
orders that punish our people.

00:15:44.400 --> 00:15:46.110
I'm raising a brown
boy who may someday

00:15:46.110 --> 00:15:48.810
wear a turban as part of
his faith in a country that

00:15:48.810 --> 00:15:51.831
is more dangerous than
the one that I was given,

00:15:51.831 --> 00:15:54.330
even more dangerous than the
one that my grandfather arrived

00:15:54.330 --> 00:15:56.230
in a century ago.

00:15:56.230 --> 00:15:59.010
So race is construct.

00:15:59.010 --> 00:16:00.680
Race is cage.

00:16:00.680 --> 00:16:04.170
And we don't understand
the danger of race

00:16:04.170 --> 00:16:06.810
until we listen to
one another's stories,

00:16:06.810 --> 00:16:09.120
until we understand that
Srinivas Kuchibhotla who

00:16:09.120 --> 00:16:11.760
was murdered on February
22nd, Indian American, told

00:16:11.760 --> 00:16:14.700
to go back to his country, is
not just a foreigner, not just

00:16:14.700 --> 00:16:17.550
an engineer immigrant.

00:16:17.550 --> 00:16:18.740
He's a brother.

00:16:18.740 --> 00:16:20.660
He's a fellow American.

00:16:20.660 --> 00:16:23.920
The Sikh American who
was shot in Washington

00:16:23.920 --> 00:16:26.310
fixing his car in
his own driveway

00:16:26.310 --> 00:16:29.580
was told to go back to
his country on March 3rd.

00:16:29.580 --> 00:16:31.380
He is a brother.

00:16:31.380 --> 00:16:35.940
But every time we hear a news
of ongoing violence, the one

00:16:35.940 --> 00:16:39.480
thing that is giving me hope is
that there are millions of us--

00:16:39.480 --> 00:16:41.395
we're having conversations
like this, right?

00:16:41.395 --> 00:16:43.770
There are millions of us now
who are politically awakened

00:16:43.770 --> 00:16:45.100
in ways that we haven't before.

00:16:45.100 --> 00:16:47.100
I feel like we've been
fighting this fight alone

00:16:47.100 --> 00:16:49.860
for 15 years, 16 years, right?

00:16:49.860 --> 00:16:52.350
If all of you,
especially those who

00:16:52.350 --> 00:16:54.420
are in positions of
relative privilege

00:16:54.420 --> 00:16:56.760
can join us in this
fight, can show up,

00:16:56.760 --> 00:17:00.660
can exercise your voice
online and on the ground,

00:17:00.660 --> 00:17:04.380
then perhaps we can start
to come out from these cages

00:17:04.380 --> 00:17:07.829
and turn these cages into
platforms of solidarity.

00:17:07.829 --> 00:17:11.760
Thank you for inviting me
here to share this with you.

00:17:11.760 --> 00:17:13.079
LORRIE MA: So I want to--

00:17:13.079 --> 00:17:14.849
before Quyen gets to go--

00:17:14.849 --> 00:17:17.410
I want to touch upon that a
little bit because I think,

00:17:17.410 --> 00:17:20.839
Phil, you mentioned that you
sort of like Asian American

00:17:20.839 --> 00:17:23.329
is a political
identity of yours.

00:17:23.329 --> 00:17:26.579
And in this era, we're
getting sort of more active.

00:17:26.579 --> 00:17:30.540
But why is it so hard for Asian
Americans in terms of this race

00:17:30.540 --> 00:17:31.320
conversation?

00:17:31.320 --> 00:17:33.469
Like why is activism
so difficult?

00:17:33.469 --> 00:17:34.510
Why do you think that is?

00:17:40.367 --> 00:17:42.825
QUYEN DINH: I really believe
that all politics is personal.

00:17:45.520 --> 00:17:51.210
And the power of
moving beyond that cage

00:17:51.210 --> 00:17:57.980
and really making this decision
to claim your identity,

00:17:57.980 --> 00:18:02.610
that I am Vietnamese
American I am Asian American.

00:18:02.610 --> 00:18:05.320
I am a woman of color.

00:18:05.320 --> 00:18:09.080
Those things are not separate.

00:18:09.080 --> 00:18:11.340
They are all part of who I am.

00:18:11.340 --> 00:18:13.290
They are all part of my legacy.

00:18:13.290 --> 00:18:16.350
They are all part of
the pain and the trauma

00:18:16.350 --> 00:18:19.380
that my parents endured
as survivors of war

00:18:19.380 --> 00:18:24.450
from the Vietnam War, as
warriors far, far beyond when

00:18:24.450 --> 00:18:28.080
we came here to
the United States.

00:18:28.080 --> 00:18:36.240
And oftentimes, I reflect on
how much privilege is required

00:18:36.240 --> 00:18:39.490
to have this conversation.

00:18:39.490 --> 00:18:42.910
Because if it weren't for UC
Berkeley and my Asian American

00:18:42.910 --> 00:18:46.690
Studies classes, I would
have not had this framework

00:18:46.690 --> 00:18:48.640
to understand race.

00:18:48.640 --> 00:18:51.010
I would not have had the
framework to understand

00:18:51.010 --> 00:18:56.110
how I am part of a historical
legacy of folks telling me

00:18:56.110 --> 00:19:00.960
who I am versus me
saying this is who I am

00:19:00.960 --> 00:19:04.050
and claiming that as
self-determination for myself

00:19:04.050 --> 00:19:07.220
and for my community.

00:19:07.220 --> 00:19:11.890
And I really do agree that that
is the reason why these very

00:19:11.890 --> 00:19:15.880
personal conversations and
dialogues about how we are

00:19:15.880 --> 00:19:20.720
impacted by race is so critical
to that self-awareness, that

00:19:20.720 --> 00:19:24.700
politicization in being able
to have a conversation that

00:19:24.700 --> 00:19:26.770
is really rooted in
understanding who you are

00:19:26.770 --> 00:19:27.940
and why you're here.

00:19:27.940 --> 00:19:32.350
And that is tremendous power
that we bring as new Americans

00:19:32.350 --> 00:19:35.030
to this country, redefining
what this country is.

00:19:39.098 --> 00:19:42.930
LORRIE MA: Phil, you looked
like you had something to say?

00:19:42.930 --> 00:19:44.680
PHIL YU: To answer
your question about why

00:19:44.680 --> 00:19:52.895
is it so hard for Asian
Americans to become active,

00:19:52.895 --> 00:19:53.395
I suppose.

00:19:55.930 --> 00:19:58.500
I always say it's
like you can get

00:19:58.500 --> 00:20:05.230
Asians so hyped up about a new
kind of food or new restaurant.

00:20:05.230 --> 00:20:06.880
But like it's so
hard to make them

00:20:06.880 --> 00:20:11.710
give a shit about everything
in terms of really

00:20:11.710 --> 00:20:13.630
when it comes to
sort of speaking out

00:20:13.630 --> 00:20:16.150
about hate crimes and justice.

00:20:16.150 --> 00:20:18.430
There's an expectation
imposed on us

00:20:18.430 --> 00:20:21.439
that we're going to be the ones
who are going to be silent.

00:20:21.439 --> 00:20:22.855
We're going to be
the ones who are

00:20:22.855 --> 00:20:26.590
to keep our heads down, be the
good minorities, and not say.

00:20:26.590 --> 00:20:29.800
Even when it's well within
our right to do, so even when

00:20:29.800 --> 00:20:31.440
we should.

00:20:31.440 --> 00:20:34.450
We should absolutely you
know kick down chairs,

00:20:34.450 --> 00:20:36.790
kick down walls, and like
say something, stand up.

00:20:36.790 --> 00:20:39.520
And I think that
there is so much--

00:20:39.520 --> 00:20:43.090
a lot of our families
are immigrants.

00:20:43.090 --> 00:20:46.420
And they sacrificed so much
to get here the first place.

00:20:46.420 --> 00:20:51.010
It is to speak out,
to say something,

00:20:51.010 --> 00:20:57.340
to make yourself
vulnerable in that way,

00:20:57.340 --> 00:20:59.486
it would seem contrary
to all the things--

00:20:59.486 --> 00:21:02.405
it would disrespect
all the sacrifices

00:21:02.405 --> 00:21:03.530
that were made to get here.

00:21:03.530 --> 00:21:08.350
But I do think that
not saying anything

00:21:08.350 --> 00:21:10.864
is disrespectful to all
the sacrifices, and all

00:21:10.864 --> 00:21:12.280
the challenges,
and all the things

00:21:12.280 --> 00:21:13.779
that we had to
overcome to get here.

00:21:16.510 --> 00:21:18.250
And I think it's
just plain easier

00:21:18.250 --> 00:21:24.670
to try to sink in, try to blend
in, and lay back on privilege,

00:21:24.670 --> 00:21:27.340
on this degree of privilege
that we have in this country.

00:21:30.760 --> 00:21:33.814
Sometimes it's just easier
to stay silent, you know?

00:21:33.814 --> 00:21:35.980
VALARIE KAUR: I want to
pick up on that because I've

00:21:35.980 --> 00:21:39.580
spent a lot of time with
Japanese American in Fresno who

00:21:39.580 --> 00:21:42.580
are now grandparents
and remembering

00:21:42.580 --> 00:21:46.000
what it was like to be interned
in those concentration camps.

00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:48.087
And Marion Masada, one of them--

00:21:48.087 --> 00:21:50.170
who has taught me to call
them concentration camps

00:21:50.170 --> 00:21:52.390
because that's what they were--

00:21:52.390 --> 00:21:54.880
has shared with me that
for many years after--

00:21:54.880 --> 00:21:57.970
she was a little girl when she
was put in those camps with her

00:21:57.970 --> 00:21:58.810
family--

00:21:58.810 --> 00:22:00.520
and for many years
after their release,

00:22:00.520 --> 00:22:01.840
her parents didn't speak out.

00:22:01.840 --> 00:22:03.160
She didn't speak out.

00:22:03.160 --> 00:22:05.764
And she likened it
to an act of incest.

00:22:05.764 --> 00:22:07.180
That here was a
nation that we had

00:22:07.180 --> 00:22:11.380
loved that committed an
act of such violation

00:22:11.380 --> 00:22:14.110
that there was confusion
and an inability

00:22:14.110 --> 00:22:18.040
to put language to the
violation that had taken place.

00:22:18.040 --> 00:22:20.050
And so few stood
up for them then.

00:22:20.050 --> 00:22:21.700
So she turns to me
and says, Valarie, I

00:22:21.700 --> 00:22:24.304
will stand up for you now.

00:22:24.304 --> 00:22:27.700
What's giving me hope is that
the kind of courage that's

00:22:27.700 --> 00:22:30.040
required to stand
up to injustice

00:22:30.040 --> 00:22:32.230
means standing up
to state violence.

00:22:32.230 --> 00:22:35.290
We know that every time
the US government targets

00:22:35.290 --> 00:22:38.470
a particular community, not
for not for what they've done,

00:22:38.470 --> 00:22:42.400
but for who they are, it
emboldens ordinary people

00:22:42.400 --> 00:22:45.010
to act on biases within them
and target those communities.

00:22:45.010 --> 00:22:49.270
So every time we see the state
punish particular communities

00:22:49.270 --> 00:22:51.940
through detentions,
deportations, surveillance,

00:22:51.940 --> 00:22:54.227
threats of torture,
we see hate crimes

00:22:54.227 --> 00:22:55.560
against those communities go up.

00:22:55.560 --> 00:22:56.710
We've seen since 9/11.

00:22:56.710 --> 00:22:59.440
We saw it since World War II.

00:22:59.440 --> 00:23:01.780
And that means that if
we, as Asian Americans,

00:23:01.780 --> 00:23:04.480
are going to stand up to try
to make our community safer,

00:23:04.480 --> 00:23:06.610
it means speaking
truth to power.

00:23:06.610 --> 00:23:07.330
Right?

00:23:07.330 --> 00:23:11.295
Muslim Ban 2.0 is coming down
tomorrow, everybody, March 16.

00:23:11.295 --> 00:23:12.295
It's happening tomorrow.

00:23:13.270 --> 00:23:18.070
I know I am bracing for more
violence against my people.

00:23:18.070 --> 00:23:20.977
Not only the refugees and the
immigrants whose lives are now,

00:23:20.977 --> 00:23:22.810
and futures are now
going to be in jeopardy,

00:23:22.810 --> 00:23:24.670
but here in our
country Americans,

00:23:24.670 --> 00:23:27.530
children in schoolyards, I
am worried for their safety.

00:23:27.530 --> 00:23:29.822
They're worried for
their own safety.

00:23:29.822 --> 00:23:31.900
Every week I'm at a
different college campus.

00:23:31.900 --> 00:23:35.350
I just got back from University
of Illinois Urbana-Champaign.

00:23:35.350 --> 00:23:38.680
And the students came up to
me with heartbreaking stories

00:23:38.680 --> 00:23:42.580
of bullying, of racial violence,
of even sexual violence,

00:23:42.580 --> 00:23:44.680
their inability to
make sense of it.

00:23:44.680 --> 00:23:47.151
These are not captured
by hate crime statistics.

00:23:47.151 --> 00:23:49.150
The hate crimes are just
the tip of the iceberg.

00:23:49.150 --> 00:23:51.640
What remains invisible
beneath the surface

00:23:51.640 --> 00:23:55.419
is what it feels like to live
in a climate of hate and fear.

00:23:55.419 --> 00:23:57.460
And we have a new generation
rising up like that.

00:23:57.460 --> 00:23:57.850
Right?

00:23:57.850 --> 00:24:00.100
They don't remember what it
was like before 9/11, Phil.

00:24:00.100 --> 00:24:00.600
We do.

00:24:00.600 --> 00:24:03.590
We have that like moral
resource, but they don't.

00:24:03.590 --> 00:24:05.470
The shadow of 9/11
is so long, people

00:24:05.470 --> 00:24:08.290
don't even realize we're
standing in the shadow.

00:24:08.290 --> 00:24:11.470
And so what it takes is courage
to stand up to state violence.

00:24:11.470 --> 00:24:15.310
And this is why you naming
warrior hood I think

00:24:15.310 --> 00:24:16.720
is like a sister yes.

00:24:16.720 --> 00:24:19.120
Like me standing with
you was warrior sister.

00:24:19.120 --> 00:24:21.850
Because I think for Asian
American communities,

00:24:21.850 --> 00:24:25.180
we inherit traditions
that we think

00:24:25.180 --> 00:24:27.220
we're just supposed to
preserve and interpret

00:24:27.220 --> 00:24:29.230
as our parents did and pass on.

00:24:29.230 --> 00:24:31.660
But actually, our religious,
our cultural heritages,

00:24:31.660 --> 00:24:32.860
they are living.

00:24:32.860 --> 00:24:35.280
They are alive and it's up
to us to reinterpret them

00:24:35.280 --> 00:24:37.180
for a new time.

00:24:37.180 --> 00:24:39.040
And so my call
right now is I want

00:24:39.040 --> 00:24:41.580
a new generation of Sikh and
South Asian and Asian American

00:24:41.580 --> 00:24:43.630
activists to rise
up as warriors.

00:24:43.630 --> 00:24:46.170
And the story tells the
story of Mai Bhago who

00:24:46.170 --> 00:24:49.810
was the first Sikh woman warrior
in the 17th century in South

00:24:49.810 --> 00:24:50.710
Asia.

00:24:50.710 --> 00:24:52.690
The story goes there
were 40 soldiers who

00:24:52.690 --> 00:24:55.160
abandoned their post
during a great battle.

00:24:55.160 --> 00:24:56.410
They came back to the village.

00:24:56.410 --> 00:24:59.350
They said the fight is too hard,
we can't go back out there.

00:24:59.350 --> 00:25:03.400
And this village woman, woman,
woman of color, turns to them

00:25:03.400 --> 00:25:08.180
and says no, no, you will
return to the battle.

00:25:08.180 --> 00:25:10.640
And I will lead you.

00:25:10.640 --> 00:25:11.840
She mounts a horse.

00:25:11.840 --> 00:25:13.910
She dons a turban with
a sword in her hand,

00:25:13.910 --> 00:25:16.490
with fire in her eyes,
she leads them back

00:25:16.490 --> 00:25:19.100
into the flames when
no one else would.

00:25:19.100 --> 00:25:22.520
She becomes the one
she is waiting for.

00:25:22.520 --> 00:25:24.230
I tell that story
because I think

00:25:24.230 --> 00:25:25.690
there is an impulse to desert.

00:25:25.690 --> 00:25:28.160
There is an impulse to give
up, to keep our head down,

00:25:28.160 --> 00:25:30.170
to play it safe.

00:25:30.170 --> 00:25:32.780
But if we can call forth
the warriors within us

00:25:32.780 --> 00:25:35.390
to take our hands
and lead us back

00:25:35.390 --> 00:25:38.180
into the fire,
that's the only way

00:25:38.180 --> 00:25:42.961
our generation will fight
the good fight here and now.

00:25:42.961 --> 00:25:48.620
QUYEN DINH: And I think
I'm reflecting on,

00:25:48.620 --> 00:25:51.500
I'm reflecting on
just how hard it

00:25:51.500 --> 00:25:55.880
is for my parents to share
their experience surviving

00:25:55.880 --> 00:25:58.790
the Vietnam War.

00:25:58.790 --> 00:26:04.230
In this room, how many of
you, how many of your parents,

00:26:04.230 --> 00:26:08.270
were the first ones
to come to the US?

00:26:08.270 --> 00:26:12.500
And in this room, how
many of those parents

00:26:12.500 --> 00:26:17.740
came because of fleeing
some sort of trauma,

00:26:17.740 --> 00:26:20.721
political trauma, religious
trauma, economic trauma,

00:26:20.721 --> 00:26:21.220
poverty?

00:26:27.440 --> 00:26:29.480
We come from
communities-- and by we,

00:26:29.480 --> 00:26:32.255
I want to talk from my own
experience being Vietnamese

00:26:32.255 --> 00:26:34.850
American--

00:26:34.850 --> 00:26:38.570
I come from a family
who has survived

00:26:38.570 --> 00:26:42.840
bombings in their countries.

00:26:42.840 --> 00:26:47.940
My parents got on a boat, sailed
across the South China Seas,

00:26:47.940 --> 00:26:49.720
ended up in Malaysia.

00:26:49.720 --> 00:26:53.420
And I was born in New Orleans.

00:26:53.420 --> 00:26:58.550
And for my entire life, the
story of the Vietnam War

00:26:58.550 --> 00:27:03.090
was rarely ever told.

00:27:03.090 --> 00:27:05.700
And when my political
moment was actually

00:27:05.700 --> 00:27:08.820
going to Washington
DC for the first time

00:27:08.820 --> 00:27:13.830
as a high school senior, what
I was so stoked about seeing

00:27:13.830 --> 00:27:16.600
was the Vietnam War Memorial.

00:27:16.600 --> 00:27:18.970
Because this memorial
to me represented

00:27:18.970 --> 00:27:22.160
why I was here in America.

00:27:22.160 --> 00:27:27.690
And as I got there, I looked
at the Smiths and the Jones

00:27:27.690 --> 00:27:30.090
and the Derricks and the Johns.

00:27:30.090 --> 00:27:33.510
And I was looking for
the Dinhs, and the Trans,

00:27:33.510 --> 00:27:36.670
and the Nguyens, and
the Ngos, and the Phams.

00:27:36.670 --> 00:27:40.910
I was looking for all
the Vietnamese soldiers

00:27:40.910 --> 00:27:46.550
who sacrificed their lives
in this fight for freedom.

00:27:46.550 --> 00:27:50.260
And I started to get
really, really angry.

00:27:50.260 --> 00:27:53.880
And I started to think about all
the children, all the people,

00:27:53.880 --> 00:27:58.300
all the families, who died
in Vietnam who were really

00:27:58.300 --> 00:28:02.740
pawns in wars, and why their
names weren't reflected

00:28:02.740 --> 00:28:05.640
on this wall.

00:28:05.640 --> 00:28:08.230
And I went back and talked
with my high school teacher

00:28:08.230 --> 00:28:10.990
while everyone else was
at the museum gift shop.

00:28:10.990 --> 00:28:13.780
And I just started bawling
and sharing with him

00:28:13.780 --> 00:28:16.970
how confused I
felt, because I felt

00:28:16.970 --> 00:28:19.460
so indebted to these
American soldiers who

00:28:19.460 --> 00:28:22.100
had sacrificed their
lives and their families

00:28:22.100 --> 00:28:24.170
for me to be here.

00:28:24.170 --> 00:28:27.180
And yet, at the same
time, I felt so invisible.

00:28:29.910 --> 00:28:32.720
And I felt betrayed.

00:28:32.720 --> 00:28:34.790
And I didn't have
the words to express

00:28:34.790 --> 00:28:36.350
what I was feeling at the time.

00:28:36.350 --> 00:28:39.260
And I think going to
Berkeley and getting

00:28:39.260 --> 00:28:41.540
my political
education I realized

00:28:41.540 --> 00:28:45.850
this was the first time that I
felt marginalized in my country

00:28:45.850 --> 00:28:47.990
where I felt like
this is not home.

00:28:47.990 --> 00:28:49.850
And it was that
moment that led me

00:28:49.850 --> 00:28:54.950
on my journey to really reclaim
what it is that who I am

00:28:54.950 --> 00:28:59.180
and the history, the people,
the historical forces that

00:28:59.180 --> 00:29:00.800
brought me here today.

00:29:00.800 --> 00:29:02.750
And I think that's
the reason why

00:29:02.750 --> 00:29:07.720
I am so passionate about
this work is because advocacy

00:29:07.720 --> 00:29:09.950
is personal to me.

00:29:09.950 --> 00:29:12.650
When I look at the
deportation orders,

00:29:12.650 --> 00:29:17.300
I think about my cousin who
came as a teenager to the US

00:29:17.300 --> 00:29:18.920
with a criminal
conviction record

00:29:18.920 --> 00:29:22.910
because there was no support
at home, no support at schools.

00:29:22.910 --> 00:29:26.470
And he has a deportation
order to Vietnam.

00:29:26.470 --> 00:29:28.940
There are 15,000 other
Southeast Asian Americans

00:29:28.940 --> 00:29:32.240
who have this same experience
and yet is not talked about.

00:29:32.240 --> 00:29:34.490
When we talk about the
Affordable Care Act being taken

00:29:34.490 --> 00:29:38.930
away, I think about my dad
who got ACA health insurance

00:29:38.930 --> 00:29:41.090
coverage for the first time.

00:29:41.090 --> 00:29:45.560
And I think about my cousins
who just came to the US

00:29:45.560 --> 00:29:46.700
from Vietnam.

00:29:46.700 --> 00:29:48.560
Who, because they
live in California,

00:29:48.560 --> 00:29:51.560
are eligible to access
Affordable Care Act and health

00:29:51.560 --> 00:29:56.030
care plans because we
expanded coverage for newly

00:29:56.030 --> 00:29:58.070
arrived immigrant communities.

00:29:58.070 --> 00:30:01.460
All of these policies
are so personal to me.

00:30:01.460 --> 00:30:07.130
And I think when we each have
that moment of connection,

00:30:07.130 --> 00:30:13.000
that's when you're able to see
a shift in how we understand

00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:16.930
ourselves and how we understand
exercising our power by raising

00:30:16.930 --> 00:30:18.640
our voices and by
being who we are.

00:30:21.450 --> 00:30:23.490
VALARIE KAUR: I am so
moved by your moment

00:30:23.490 --> 00:30:25.750
at the Vietnam Memorial.

00:30:25.750 --> 00:30:27.660
And I want to share
with you, I think

00:30:27.660 --> 00:30:31.590
what it tells us is the
importance of historical memory

00:30:31.590 --> 00:30:35.970
and storytelling and
our charge for here now.

00:30:35.970 --> 00:30:38.490
Because I had that
moment, my moment

00:30:38.490 --> 00:30:44.310
was the 9/11 Memorial where
I have only gone for moments.

00:30:44.310 --> 00:30:48.810
Because just as I mourn the
3,000 people who were killed,

00:30:48.810 --> 00:30:49.860
I stand at the fountain.

00:30:49.860 --> 00:30:52.470
I feel the spray of
the water at my face.

00:30:52.470 --> 00:30:55.470
I run my hands over their names.

00:30:55.470 --> 00:30:58.500
But in the museum and
at the memorial itself,

00:30:58.500 --> 00:31:01.980
there is not a
moment of recognition

00:31:01.980 --> 00:31:05.220
for all the violence that was
done in the aftermath of 9/11.

00:31:05.220 --> 00:31:06.810
So it's like I
grieve my community.

00:31:06.810 --> 00:31:08.410
I grieve my country.

00:31:08.410 --> 00:31:11.760
And I want to be able to own
this narrative completely

00:31:11.760 --> 00:31:13.980
but I felt invisible.

00:31:13.980 --> 00:31:17.550
That changed this
last 9/11 anniversary.

00:31:17.550 --> 00:31:21.480
I had a woman Carrie Kelly
who lost her stepfather

00:31:21.480 --> 00:31:24.930
in the towers, he was
a fireman, invited

00:31:24.930 --> 00:31:27.270
me to come and grieve with her.

00:31:27.270 --> 00:31:28.941
And oh, I grieved.

00:31:28.941 --> 00:31:30.690
There was something
in me that broke open.

00:31:30.690 --> 00:31:33.300
And I was just sobbing,
because I realized for 15 years

00:31:33.300 --> 00:31:37.050
I had not been given
permission to grieve on 9/11.

00:31:37.050 --> 00:31:39.690
Because from that moment,
I had to work to protect

00:31:39.690 --> 00:31:41.430
my community from being killed.

00:31:41.430 --> 00:31:43.740
So she gave me permission to
enter that grief with her.

00:31:43.740 --> 00:31:45.323
And then she did
something remarkable.

00:31:45.323 --> 00:31:48.300
She said, let me come with you
to the memorial of Balbir Singh

00:31:48.300 --> 00:31:50.190
Sodhi in Arizona.

00:31:50.190 --> 00:31:51.680
And so she traveled with me.

00:31:51.680 --> 00:31:56.040
And the 9/11 Memorial,
the whole world knows.

00:31:56.040 --> 00:32:00.390
The memorial that lies at the
corner of a Chevron gas station

00:32:00.390 --> 00:32:02.590
in Arizona nobody knows.

00:32:02.590 --> 00:32:05.110
It's the spot where Balbir
Uncle bled to death.

00:32:05.110 --> 00:32:07.290
And there's a tiny
plaque in the corner.

00:32:07.290 --> 00:32:10.770
And I see this place as
the second ground zero.

00:32:10.770 --> 00:32:13.530
It is the ground zero for
every single person who

00:32:13.530 --> 00:32:17.179
was killed in reaction to
9/11, not just in hate crimes,

00:32:17.179 --> 00:32:19.470
but in the wars abroad--
civilians and soldiers alike--

00:32:19.470 --> 00:32:21.270
it is a second ground zero.

00:32:21.270 --> 00:32:24.480
And I stood at that spot and
I put roses on the ground

00:32:24.480 --> 00:32:26.820
next to his brother Rana Sodhi.

00:32:26.820 --> 00:32:28.860
And Ranajeet turned to me--

00:32:28.860 --> 00:32:31.680
this was just in
September, September 15.

00:32:31.680 --> 00:32:35.220
And he said 15 years
and nothing has changed.

00:32:35.220 --> 00:32:36.990
And I asked him,
Ranajeet, what is the one

00:32:36.990 --> 00:32:38.700
thing we have not tried yet?

00:32:38.700 --> 00:32:40.470
Who is the one person
we have not tried

00:32:40.470 --> 00:32:42.840
to extend our love to yet?

00:32:42.840 --> 00:32:46.200
And we said, it's the murderer.

00:32:46.200 --> 00:32:47.670
It's the person
who took his life--

00:32:47.670 --> 00:32:52.300
Frank Roque-- who is lingering
in a prison some miles away.

00:32:52.300 --> 00:32:54.240
And so, out of
desperation almost,

00:32:54.240 --> 00:32:56.370
we do something
that was unthinkable

00:32:56.370 --> 00:33:01.320
before, we called the prison
the next morning to talk

00:33:01.320 --> 00:33:03.600
to Balbir Sodhi's murderer.

00:33:03.600 --> 00:33:07.860
And in the beginning, I think
it's a complete disaster.

00:33:07.860 --> 00:33:09.750
Frank says, yes,
I'm sorry for what

00:33:09.750 --> 00:33:11.640
happened on 9/11-- on 9/15.

00:33:11.640 --> 00:33:13.940
But I'm also sorry for all
the people who died on 9/11.

00:33:13.940 --> 00:33:17.370
And at this moment I think
there are limits to love.

00:33:17.370 --> 00:33:20.520
How dare I think
that I could engage

00:33:20.520 --> 00:33:22.890
in this moment of
reconciliation now?

00:33:22.890 --> 00:33:26.310
And Rana Sodhi, he
hears what I can't.

00:33:26.310 --> 00:33:28.050
He says, Frank, this
is the first time

00:33:28.050 --> 00:33:30.810
I've ever heard you
say you were sorry.

00:33:30.810 --> 00:33:32.610
He takes a step toward Frank.

00:33:32.610 --> 00:33:34.020
Frank takes a step toward him.

00:33:34.020 --> 00:33:35.970
He says, yes, I am sorry.

00:33:35.970 --> 00:33:39.720
I'm sorry for what I did
to you and your family.

00:33:39.720 --> 00:33:42.500
And when I go to heaven
to be judged by God,

00:33:42.500 --> 00:33:44.670
I will ask to see your uncle.

00:33:44.670 --> 00:33:49.960
And I will hug him and I
will ask for his forgiveness.

00:33:49.960 --> 00:33:54.960
And Rana Sodhi says, we
have already forgiven you.

00:33:54.960 --> 00:33:58.810
I tell that story
because the only reason

00:33:58.810 --> 00:34:03.750
anyone knows it is because
we posted it online.

00:34:03.750 --> 00:34:06.370
The time of Vietnam,
and even at the time

00:34:06.370 --> 00:34:08.050
when September 11th
first happened,

00:34:08.050 --> 00:34:11.230
we did not have the open
and free internet and all

00:34:11.230 --> 00:34:14.020
the platforms we have to
tell our community stories.

00:34:14.020 --> 00:34:17.290
Historical memory was owned by
the powerful few that framed

00:34:17.290 --> 00:34:20.020
whose lives were grievable
and whose weren't.

00:34:20.020 --> 00:34:21.580
And now we have tools.

00:34:21.580 --> 00:34:24.310
We have tools to tell the
stories of those who you

00:34:24.310 --> 00:34:25.570
are defending in deportations.

00:34:25.570 --> 00:34:28.480
We have tools to tell Rana
Sodhi's story and his act

00:34:28.480 --> 00:34:30.070
of revolutionary love.

00:34:30.070 --> 00:34:31.659
We have tools now,
I can tell you

00:34:31.659 --> 00:34:35.110
this is a second ground zero
to remember, to claim, as a way

00:34:35.110 --> 00:34:36.881
to continue to fight
the good fight.

00:34:36.881 --> 00:34:39.380
And so what you are doing here,
with the revolution that you

00:34:39.380 --> 00:34:41.993
are all part of, and
giving communities voice

00:34:41.993 --> 00:34:44.409
through Google and through all
the initiatives you support

00:34:44.409 --> 00:34:47.110
is actually part of the
movement for social justice

00:34:47.110 --> 00:34:47.860
in this country.

00:34:47.860 --> 00:34:49.090
It means the world to us.

00:34:49.090 --> 00:34:51.074
[APPLAUSE]

00:34:56.045 --> 00:34:56.920
LORRIE MA: All right.

00:34:56.920 --> 00:34:58.740
Let's get the round of applause.

00:34:58.740 --> 00:35:03.040
So growing up, so I'm actually--
not many people know this--

00:35:03.040 --> 00:35:04.234
but I grew up in China.

00:35:04.234 --> 00:35:05.650
So I was born and
raised in China.

00:35:05.650 --> 00:35:07.280
And I came here when I was 10.

00:35:07.280 --> 00:35:11.540
And I was severely bullied in
school because I was different.

00:35:11.540 --> 00:35:14.260
And one of the things
that growing up I was told

00:35:14.260 --> 00:35:17.320
was if you just kept your
head down and just kept

00:35:17.320 --> 00:35:19.810
doing what you were
doing, just stay silent,

00:35:19.810 --> 00:35:21.860
you would just get through
this, and it's fine.

00:35:21.860 --> 00:35:24.790
And this is something that
culturally was ingrained in me

00:35:24.790 --> 00:35:29.140
to just be this sort of
silent model minority.

00:35:29.140 --> 00:35:32.410
And my parents built their
success on the back of this,

00:35:32.410 --> 00:35:34.720
just being silent, not
airing your "dirty laundry"

00:35:34.720 --> 00:35:36.800
quote unquote, and
sort of staying

00:35:36.800 --> 00:35:39.550
in this little confinement.

00:35:39.550 --> 00:35:42.370
And a lot of people
actually, stereotypically,

00:35:42.370 --> 00:35:44.920
feel that the success
of Asian American

00:35:44.920 --> 00:35:46.870
is because they are
sort of this model

00:35:46.870 --> 00:35:50.050
minority and this silent,
invisible population.

00:35:50.050 --> 00:35:51.910
How do you reconcile
that with some

00:35:51.910 --> 00:35:54.670
of the things that are happening
today and some of the activism

00:35:54.670 --> 00:35:56.130
that you're sort
of advocating for?

00:36:00.200 --> 00:36:02.720
PHIL YU: I mean for me,
look, the number one question

00:36:02.720 --> 00:36:07.220
I get about my work, And
it's like why did you

00:36:07.220 --> 00:36:09.500
call your blog Angry Asian Man?

00:36:09.500 --> 00:36:13.012
Like what made you so angry?

00:36:13.012 --> 00:36:14.720
Was there some inciting
moment like that?

00:36:14.720 --> 00:36:15.790
And it really wasn't.

00:36:15.790 --> 00:36:19.760
It really was just
coming on my own

00:36:19.760 --> 00:36:22.970
this journey that I
was having towards

00:36:22.970 --> 00:36:25.400
some sort of Asian American
political consciousness

00:36:25.400 --> 00:36:28.744
through school, through
Asian American Studies.

00:36:28.744 --> 00:36:31.160
So there wasn't any one-- like
I wasn't a victim of a hate

00:36:31.160 --> 00:36:32.960
crime, and I was
like, oh, so mad I've

00:36:32.960 --> 00:36:35.210
got to go to my computer
and start writing.

00:36:35.210 --> 00:36:39.664
But if I look back-- so I
always tell people that--

00:36:39.664 --> 00:36:44.370
but I look back and
it's called Angry Asian

00:36:44.370 --> 00:36:46.170
Man because that is so--

00:36:46.170 --> 00:36:51.000
that idea of angry Asian
anything is so in the face of,

00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:53.670
it's so contrary to the
perception of Asians

00:36:53.670 --> 00:36:55.260
in this country in the West.

00:36:55.260 --> 00:36:59.010
It's like we're supposed to
be this the silent, the quiet

00:36:59.010 --> 00:36:59.760
types.

00:36:59.760 --> 00:37:02.850
The ones who don't raise our
voice, the ones who don't say

00:37:02.850 --> 00:37:04.080
anything, and don't speak up.

00:37:04.080 --> 00:37:05.340
And I was like I
just wanted something

00:37:05.340 --> 00:37:07.560
that was confrontational,
that was provocative.

00:37:07.560 --> 00:37:08.976
And so when people
visit the site,

00:37:08.976 --> 00:37:11.520
they see that it's like it's
an affront to their senses,

00:37:11.520 --> 00:37:14.186
angry Asian.

00:37:14.186 --> 00:37:15.810
But when I look back
at my own journey,

00:37:15.810 --> 00:37:17.670
I think there was
really one inciting--

00:37:17.670 --> 00:37:19.200
there was an inciting moment.

00:37:19.200 --> 00:37:23.040
The one that really sort
of lit a fire and made me

00:37:23.040 --> 00:37:28.590
realize that I was a part of
a tradition that was already

00:37:28.590 --> 00:37:30.210
existed of Asian
American activism,

00:37:30.210 --> 00:37:31.543
of people who were speaking out.

00:37:33.890 --> 00:37:36.300
It was when I learned about
the murder of Vincent Chin.

00:37:36.300 --> 00:37:38.800
Do people here know
who Vincent Chin was?

00:37:38.800 --> 00:37:41.220
Just a show of hands,
I want to just--

00:37:41.220 --> 00:37:44.820
So for people who don't
know, Vincent Chin in 1982,

00:37:44.820 --> 00:37:46.850
he was in Detroit, this
Chinese American guy.

00:37:46.850 --> 00:37:48.630
He was out for his
bachelor party.

00:37:48.630 --> 00:37:51.080
He was going to get married
in a couple of days.

00:37:51.080 --> 00:37:52.913
He ends up getting in
an argument with a guy

00:37:52.913 --> 00:37:56.760
at a strip club for
his bachelor party.

00:37:56.760 --> 00:38:00.667
And the witnesses remember
overhearing the man saying

00:38:00.667 --> 00:38:02.250
to Vincent, it's
because of you mother

00:38:02.250 --> 00:38:03.780
fuckers that we're out of work.

00:38:03.780 --> 00:38:10.560
And he was referring
to auto jobs being

00:38:10.560 --> 00:38:12.230
lost to Japanese manufacturers.

00:38:12.230 --> 00:38:14.100
They were in Detroit.

00:38:14.100 --> 00:38:15.390
And the fight breaks out.

00:38:15.390 --> 00:38:18.600
And Vincent Chin ends up
getting killed with a baseball

00:38:18.600 --> 00:38:20.840
bat, his head bashed in.

00:38:20.840 --> 00:38:22.980
Goes into a coma and
dies three days later.

00:38:22.980 --> 00:38:26.960
Learning about this
case-- and so this case

00:38:26.960 --> 00:38:28.830
it was about a hate
crime, but it was also

00:38:28.830 --> 00:38:31.620
about the demand for
justice that swelled up

00:38:31.620 --> 00:38:36.900
from a Pan Asian movement
fighting for justice

00:38:36.900 --> 00:38:39.240
for Vincent Chin and
against his killers.

00:38:39.240 --> 00:38:42.254
I learned about the case
nearly 20 years after the fact

00:38:42.254 --> 00:38:43.170
when I was in college.

00:38:43.170 --> 00:38:46.890
And I honestly when I learned
about it, for my first instinct

00:38:46.890 --> 00:38:48.239
was to get really angry.

00:38:48.239 --> 00:38:50.530
Not only because of what
happened and the circumstances

00:38:50.530 --> 00:38:51.030
of the case.

00:38:51.030 --> 00:38:52.900
That is infuriating.

00:38:52.900 --> 00:38:56.110
But because like why haven't
I heard about this before?

00:38:56.110 --> 00:38:57.930
Why am I only learning
about this now?

00:38:57.930 --> 00:39:00.060
Like this is something
that is part of my history,

00:39:00.060 --> 00:39:03.960
because it swelled up in me
just this idea of every moment

00:39:03.960 --> 00:39:06.390
where someone called
me a racial slur,

00:39:06.390 --> 00:39:09.210
where I was made to feel like
I did not belong in the country

00:39:09.210 --> 00:39:11.477
that I was born in.

00:39:11.477 --> 00:39:12.810
All that sort of just welled up.

00:39:12.810 --> 00:39:19.860
And I realized it's like this
idea of finding your voice,

00:39:19.860 --> 00:39:23.054
raising your voice, and
getting angry about something.

00:39:23.054 --> 00:39:24.720
That was something I
had not been taught

00:39:24.720 --> 00:39:27.660
by suppressing some of
these histories that

00:39:27.660 --> 00:39:29.170
were relevant to me.

00:39:29.170 --> 00:39:31.080
The history of civil
rights in this country

00:39:31.080 --> 00:39:34.260
is amazing, and incredible,
and we owe a debt

00:39:34.260 --> 00:39:36.530
to that as Asian American.

00:39:36.530 --> 00:39:40.130
But so many people have taught
me that where's my place?

00:39:40.130 --> 00:39:43.320
Like I'm absent
from that, you know?

00:39:43.320 --> 00:39:45.900
At least that's what was
sort of taught in my way.

00:39:45.900 --> 00:39:47.070
And I was like no, no, no.

00:39:47.070 --> 00:39:49.744
There is a history of activism
amongst Asian Americans

00:39:49.744 --> 00:39:50.410
in this country.

00:39:50.410 --> 00:39:54.540
And so I realize that there is
this idea of us being quiet,

00:39:54.540 --> 00:39:59.070
because it kind of
suppresses this identity

00:39:59.070 --> 00:40:00.870
that we are allowed
to have, that we're

00:40:00.870 --> 00:40:03.570
allowed to be part of
the things that shape

00:40:03.570 --> 00:40:05.340
and mold this country.

00:40:05.340 --> 00:40:07.742
And I'm talking about when
people holler and get mad

00:40:07.742 --> 00:40:09.450
and get angry about
stuff, because that's

00:40:09.450 --> 00:40:12.230
when shit gets done, you know?

00:40:12.230 --> 00:40:14.480
VALARIE KAUR: So I'm the
director of the Revolutionary

00:40:14.480 --> 00:40:15.740
Love Project.

00:40:15.740 --> 00:40:19.010
And I love Angry Asian Man.

00:40:19.010 --> 00:40:19.850
I love you.

00:40:19.850 --> 00:40:22.427
And I also love the platform
and I love the name.

00:40:22.427 --> 00:40:23.635
PHIL YU: Please call me Phil.

00:40:23.635 --> 00:40:25.300
[LAUGHTER]

00:40:28.252 --> 00:40:30.710
VALARIE KAUR: I think that
anger has such an important role

00:40:30.710 --> 00:40:33.110
in our movements, a vital role.

00:40:33.110 --> 00:40:37.520
And as Asian Americans, but also
as women, and as Asian women,

00:40:37.520 --> 00:40:40.370
and South Asian women,
we are consistently

00:40:40.370 --> 00:40:45.290
taught to bury our rage,
to suffocate our anger,

00:40:45.290 --> 00:40:47.870
to compromise, to
sacrifice, for the good

00:40:47.870 --> 00:40:52.040
of the family, or the wider
community, or the country.

00:40:52.040 --> 00:40:54.230
When I define
revolutionary love, what

00:40:54.230 --> 00:40:56.134
makes it revolutionary
is that we

00:40:56.134 --> 00:40:58.550
are extending-- we're thinking
about love not as a passing

00:40:58.550 --> 00:41:00.080
feeling, but as a commitment.

00:41:00.080 --> 00:41:01.550
As a commitment
to extend our will

00:41:01.550 --> 00:41:04.040
for the flourishing
of others, even

00:41:04.040 --> 00:41:05.824
our opponents, and ourselves.

00:41:05.824 --> 00:41:08.240
And when we love in the face
of fear, or rage, or vitriol,

00:41:08.240 --> 00:41:09.540
then love can be revolutionary.

00:41:09.540 --> 00:41:11.040
It can change things, right?

00:41:11.040 --> 00:41:14.840
But love is not the
absence of rage.

00:41:14.840 --> 00:41:17.360
Love, the first step
on the path of love

00:41:17.360 --> 00:41:20.102
is actually owning
our moral outrage.

00:41:20.102 --> 00:41:21.560
In the face of the
Executive Orders

00:41:21.560 --> 00:41:23.570
coming down, in the face
of Vincent Chin's murder,

00:41:23.570 --> 00:41:25.236
in the face Balbir
Singh Sodhi's murder,

00:41:25.236 --> 00:41:29.110
in the face of Srinivasjeet's
murder, we ought to be angry.

00:41:29.110 --> 00:41:30.659
And we need you to
be angry with us.

00:41:30.659 --> 00:41:31.700
Because here's the thing.

00:41:31.700 --> 00:41:33.800
If we hold our
rage in isolation--

00:41:33.800 --> 00:41:36.100
Hannah Arendt says
isolation breeds tyranny.

00:41:36.100 --> 00:41:38.390
But if we hold our
rage in isolation,

00:41:38.390 --> 00:41:40.820
that's when it
festers into hate.

00:41:40.820 --> 00:41:42.350
That's when it eats us alive.

00:41:42.350 --> 00:41:44.870
And that's when cycles
of aggression continue.

00:41:44.870 --> 00:41:47.720
But if we hold our
rage in community,

00:41:47.720 --> 00:41:50.270
then we can release
its creative energy.

00:41:50.270 --> 00:41:52.250
We walk together on
the path of love.

00:41:52.250 --> 00:41:56.180
And eventually, eventually,
we may arrive in Forgiveness

00:41:56.180 --> 00:41:58.710
because forgiveness
is not forgetting.

00:41:58.710 --> 00:42:01.070
Like I will never forget what
happened to Balbir Uncle,

00:42:01.070 --> 00:42:02.090
never.

00:42:02.090 --> 00:42:04.384
Forgiveness is
freedom from hate.

00:42:04.384 --> 00:42:06.050
That's what Rana Sodhi
taught me when he

00:42:06.050 --> 00:42:07.880
forgave his brother's killer.

00:42:07.880 --> 00:42:09.630
But he was free
enough from hate.

00:42:09.630 --> 00:42:12.740
So this Administration
that we're

00:42:12.740 --> 00:42:14.960
fighting, that so many
of us are fighting,

00:42:14.960 --> 00:42:19.320
I refuse to hate them, because
I refuse to be like them.

00:42:19.320 --> 00:42:21.290
I will fight them
with my moral outrage

00:42:21.290 --> 00:42:23.120
and with love as
my guiding ethic.

00:42:23.120 --> 00:42:24.890
And eventually, maybe,
it will arrive us

00:42:24.890 --> 00:42:26.510
to a place of forgiveness.

00:42:26.510 --> 00:42:28.940
Because in the end,
our enemies are not

00:42:28.940 --> 00:42:30.260
these individual bad guys.

00:42:30.260 --> 00:42:31.430
It's not Vincent's murderer.

00:42:31.430 --> 00:42:32.280
It's not Frank Roque.

00:42:32.280 --> 00:42:34.154
It's not even this
president or any terrorist

00:42:34.154 --> 00:42:35.600
who tries to attack us.

00:42:35.600 --> 00:42:39.620
Our enemy are the cultures
and the institutions of power

00:42:39.620 --> 00:42:41.134
that allow them to hurt us.

00:42:41.134 --> 00:42:43.300
We can take out as many bad
guys as we want and more

00:42:43.300 --> 00:42:44.780
will step into their place.

00:42:44.780 --> 00:42:46.700
But a real, lasting
social change

00:42:46.700 --> 00:42:49.130
is changing the context,
changing culture,

00:42:49.130 --> 00:42:50.990
changing institutions of power.

00:42:50.990 --> 00:42:53.420
And so revolutionary love,
the call to revolutionary love

00:42:53.420 --> 00:42:56.300
that we're building right
now in our movement,

00:42:56.300 --> 00:42:59.000
is really taking from
Gandhi and King and Mandela

00:42:59.000 --> 00:43:01.175
and offering a way to
sustain our movement.

00:43:01.175 --> 00:43:03.420
And that's not just in the
next few weeks or months,

00:43:03.420 --> 00:43:05.360
but in the years to come.

00:43:05.360 --> 00:43:08.450
And I think if we walk
with a moral outrage,

00:43:08.450 --> 00:43:12.930
but we're walking on the path
of love, then we'll get there.

00:43:12.930 --> 00:43:19.160
QUYEN DINH: And I think
walking on the path of healing.

00:43:19.160 --> 00:43:23.750
And I think about healing
because we have all

00:43:23.750 --> 00:43:26.720
received those messages,
or as Asian American women.

00:43:26.720 --> 00:43:31.610
I've certainly been told from
my parents to not talk so loud.

00:43:31.610 --> 00:43:37.360
And I have to recognize that
this is how they survived.

00:43:37.360 --> 00:43:41.290
That for them, as
refugees to America

00:43:41.290 --> 00:43:43.210
without a single
word of English,

00:43:43.210 --> 00:43:45.560
this is how they survived.

00:43:45.560 --> 00:43:51.620
And that recognition allows me
to understand that maybe this

00:43:51.620 --> 00:43:53.840
isn't who they want me to be.

00:43:53.840 --> 00:43:54.830
I am someone else.

00:43:54.830 --> 00:43:58.280
In fact, they raised me to be
a very different, strong, loud

00:43:58.280 --> 00:43:59.430
person.

00:43:59.430 --> 00:44:06.670
And by recognizing that, I
release my anger towards them.

00:44:06.670 --> 00:44:12.550
I release my anger towards them
and choose to own my voice.

00:44:12.550 --> 00:44:15.850
I think that on an
individual level,

00:44:15.850 --> 00:44:18.310
it also happened-- this
is on an individual level,

00:44:18.310 --> 00:44:20.590
but it also happens
on a systems level

00:44:20.590 --> 00:44:23.530
in the communities and the
cultures that we create.

00:44:23.530 --> 00:44:26.230
And oftentimes, I
think about reclaiming

00:44:26.230 --> 00:44:28.600
what silence means actually.

00:44:28.600 --> 00:44:33.130
So one of the concepts
that we learn a lot about,

00:44:33.130 --> 00:44:36.670
or that we hear a lot about now
these days, is implicit bias.

00:44:36.670 --> 00:44:39.610
Particularly, against
African-American communities

00:44:39.610 --> 00:44:44.474
being really with huge
assumptions that these are

00:44:44.474 --> 00:44:45.640
communities who are violent.

00:44:45.640 --> 00:44:50.140
And young African-American
boys and girls

00:44:50.140 --> 00:44:54.550
get pushed out of school and
get disciplined at higher rates.

00:44:54.550 --> 00:44:56.140
Whereas Asian
Americans, maybe we

00:44:56.140 --> 00:44:59.740
have benefited from this
because of the assumption

00:44:59.740 --> 00:45:03.580
from educators that you're
the superstar students.

00:45:03.580 --> 00:45:09.200
And oftentimes, I share silence
does not mean understanding.

00:45:09.200 --> 00:45:13.280
Silence can mean that they
are crying out for help

00:45:13.280 --> 00:45:16.070
and they don't know what
to do to get that help.

00:45:16.070 --> 00:45:19.070
And as institutional
leaders, I think

00:45:19.070 --> 00:45:22.790
it is our responsibility
to test those assumptions

00:45:22.790 --> 00:45:26.240
and check our assumptions
and create spaces

00:45:26.240 --> 00:45:29.330
where our voices can be
heard, where our voices lead

00:45:29.330 --> 00:45:32.240
to decisions that
are made beyond just

00:45:32.240 --> 00:45:35.480
our own individual selves,
and the work that we

00:45:35.480 --> 00:45:36.837
do 9:00 to 5:00.

00:45:36.837 --> 00:45:38.420
LORRIE MA: And I
think I want to pivot

00:45:38.420 --> 00:45:40.440
that since you kind
of mentioned that you

00:45:40.440 --> 00:45:42.020
are an executive director.

00:45:42.020 --> 00:45:44.160
How do we do that
in the workplace?

00:45:44.160 --> 00:45:46.100
How do we have those
racial conversations?

00:45:46.100 --> 00:45:48.860
How do we break the silence
or own the silence or whatever

00:45:48.860 --> 00:45:51.235
it is that we're supposed to
be doing in the workplace?

00:45:51.235 --> 00:45:53.360
How do we kind of propel
this conversation forward?

00:45:56.290 --> 00:45:58.040
QUYEN DINH: I'm sure
Valarie and Phil have

00:45:58.040 --> 00:45:59.630
amazing insights on this, too.

00:45:59.630 --> 00:46:04.120
But some of the questions
that you prepared for us

00:46:04.120 --> 00:46:07.310
were about the Bamboo
Ceiling, and what

00:46:07.310 --> 00:46:09.680
it means to be an Asian
American woman in particular,

00:46:09.680 --> 00:46:11.540
and I was sharing
with Phil and Valarie

00:46:11.540 --> 00:46:13.820
that I have no idea
what that means.

00:46:13.820 --> 00:46:17.750
Because I spent my entire
career in a nonprofit sector

00:46:17.750 --> 00:46:21.080
that was led by
Asian American women.

00:46:21.080 --> 00:46:24.530
And now I'm the fourth executive
director of our National

00:46:24.530 --> 00:46:26.480
Advocacy organization.

00:46:26.480 --> 00:46:30.460
And in our team of 12, we
have 10 amazing, fierce women.

00:46:33.470 --> 00:46:36.170
And one of the
tremendous moments

00:46:36.170 --> 00:46:37.580
that we're in
right now, I think,

00:46:37.580 --> 00:46:40.670
is to challenge ourselves
to love even more.

00:46:43.310 --> 00:46:48.980
When our President
got elected, I

00:46:48.980 --> 00:46:51.850
encouraged my team to
actually come into the office

00:46:51.850 --> 00:46:54.180
and to come into work.

00:46:54.180 --> 00:47:02.440
And we spent two hours
in really deep mourning

00:47:02.440 --> 00:47:06.290
and in deep conversation
with each other.

00:47:06.290 --> 00:47:11.180
And we recognized that this
space had to be created,

00:47:11.180 --> 00:47:18.190
not only to share how
attacked we felt, how isolated

00:47:18.190 --> 00:47:21.250
we felt by this decision that
America does not accept who we

00:47:21.250 --> 00:47:25.820
are, but also a
place to allow us

00:47:25.820 --> 00:47:30.500
to talk about our fathers, our
cousins, who voted for Donald

00:47:30.500 --> 00:47:32.180
Trump.

00:47:32.180 --> 00:47:35.180
All of his supporters
who are going

00:47:35.180 --> 00:47:39.470
to be betrayed by
so many policies

00:47:39.470 --> 00:47:42.050
are going to really hurt them.

00:47:42.050 --> 00:47:45.500
And what that means for us
to reach across communities

00:47:45.500 --> 00:47:48.920
to really build
this surge of love,

00:47:48.920 --> 00:47:52.890
of unity, and of understanding
with one another.

00:47:52.890 --> 00:47:56.090
And that's how we created
that space at SEARAC

00:47:56.090 --> 00:48:00.890
is really being very intentional
about creating that time for us

00:48:00.890 --> 00:48:03.530
to be together and
to continue creating

00:48:03.530 --> 00:48:05.090
those spaces for
those conversations

00:48:05.090 --> 00:48:09.320
to happen and recognize
that sometimes it starts

00:48:09.320 --> 00:48:13.650
with silence and just being
able to be OK with that,

00:48:13.650 --> 00:48:16.640
but being able to move into
really deep conversation

00:48:16.640 --> 00:48:19.670
and dialogue with deep trust
and respect to one another.

00:48:23.845 --> 00:48:25.720
PHIL YU: In talking
about the Bamboo Ceiling,

00:48:25.720 --> 00:48:27.670
I have very little
insight, honestly,

00:48:27.670 --> 00:48:30.850
in terms of traditional
work spaces.

00:48:30.850 --> 00:48:35.749
I can say this, it starts
with things like this,

00:48:35.749 --> 00:48:37.040
having conversations like this.

00:48:37.040 --> 00:48:39.470
But it also starts with
acknowledging being Asian,

00:48:39.470 --> 00:48:41.000
being Asian American.

00:48:41.000 --> 00:48:42.140
It doesn't mean nothing.

00:48:42.140 --> 00:48:44.720
It doesn't mean a neutral
identity in the workspace.

00:48:44.720 --> 00:48:50.060
It's doesn't mean like nearly
white or it doesn't mean like--

00:48:50.060 --> 00:48:52.880
the fact that there is
an employee affinity

00:48:52.880 --> 00:48:55.497
group here for Asians, like
make that mean something.

00:48:55.497 --> 00:48:57.080
Don't just mean like,
hey, we all kind

00:48:57.080 --> 00:48:58.880
of look like each other, so.

00:48:58.880 --> 00:49:00.350
What does that mean?

00:49:00.350 --> 00:49:02.180
Oh, we all like
certain kinds of food?

00:49:02.180 --> 00:49:05.780
There is a challenge that
comes with that you know.

00:49:05.780 --> 00:49:09.867
And I speak to a
lot of colleges,

00:49:09.867 --> 00:49:12.200
a lot of student groups, a
lot of Asian American student

00:49:12.200 --> 00:49:13.130
groups.

00:49:13.130 --> 00:49:17.751
And I challenge them make
your Asian American--

00:49:17.751 --> 00:49:19.250
it's like the Asian
American student

00:49:19.250 --> 00:49:21.050
association on their campus.

00:49:21.050 --> 00:49:23.980
And there's a fairly
large, robust membership.

00:49:23.980 --> 00:49:26.330
But like make that gathering
about something other

00:49:26.330 --> 00:49:28.760
than Boga nights at your campus.

00:49:28.760 --> 00:49:31.280
What do you want this being
Asian American to be about?

00:49:31.280 --> 00:49:33.470
What kind of resource
do you want to be?

00:49:33.470 --> 00:49:35.540
What kind of space
do you want to create

00:49:35.540 --> 00:49:37.640
that this Asian
American identity exists

00:49:37.640 --> 00:49:40.310
beyond just like the check box?

00:49:40.310 --> 00:49:44.061
But what happens when
you come face-to-face

00:49:44.061 --> 00:49:45.810
with some kind of
discrimination on campus

00:49:45.810 --> 00:49:47.660
and they need someone
to talk about this,

00:49:47.660 --> 00:49:49.050
they need a space
to talk about this?

00:49:49.050 --> 00:49:50.466
Are you going to
be in that space?

00:49:50.466 --> 00:49:53.540
Because you're
the clear, obvious

00:49:53.540 --> 00:49:55.007
mobilized group to do so.

00:49:55.007 --> 00:49:56.840
Or is it just going to
be about Boga nights?

00:49:56.840 --> 00:50:00.560
Is it just going to
be about the fashion

00:50:00.560 --> 00:50:02.330
talents-- the Asian
fashion talent, which

00:50:02.330 --> 00:50:03.477
is awesome and fun.

00:50:03.477 --> 00:50:05.060
And we need to have
those spaces, too.

00:50:05.060 --> 00:50:06.601
But like what's it
going to be about?

00:50:06.601 --> 00:50:09.590
So I think it really
is about being

00:50:09.590 --> 00:50:12.140
intentional about the
gathering, about the group,

00:50:12.140 --> 00:50:14.420
about the community
that you create

00:50:14.420 --> 00:50:16.790
when under this banner of
Asian American, you know.

00:50:19.860 --> 00:50:22.500
VALARIE KAUR: Sonia
is coming to my mind.

00:50:22.500 --> 00:50:26.010
Sonia is a pharmacist
in Chicago,

00:50:26.010 --> 00:50:27.420
an Indian American mother.

00:50:27.420 --> 00:50:29.680
And I was with her last week.

00:50:29.680 --> 00:50:32.400
And she came to me after
work completely distressed

00:50:32.400 --> 00:50:36.990
saying that she was at the cash
register when a man walked,

00:50:36.990 --> 00:50:38.610
a customer walked,
into the store

00:50:38.610 --> 00:50:41.280
and started to say
all of my problems

00:50:41.280 --> 00:50:44.370
are because of you foreigners
and ranted on and on,

00:50:44.370 --> 00:50:45.990
basically echoing
what he has heard

00:50:45.990 --> 00:50:47.620
from the President
and people in power

00:50:47.620 --> 00:50:49.020
but directing it at Sonia.

00:50:49.020 --> 00:50:51.420
And she stays quiet
working the register.

00:50:51.420 --> 00:50:54.060
Her white coworkers
are next to her.

00:50:54.060 --> 00:50:55.160
The man leaves.

00:50:55.160 --> 00:50:58.440
And after the man leaves the
white coworkers turn to her

00:50:58.440 --> 00:50:59.910
and say are you OK?

00:50:59.910 --> 00:51:00.720
She's shaken.

00:51:00.720 --> 00:51:03.070
She says yes, I'm OK.

00:51:03.070 --> 00:51:04.980
And she says to me,
what should I have done?

00:51:04.980 --> 00:51:05.970
I feel so ashamed.

00:51:05.970 --> 00:51:06.970
I should have done more.

00:51:06.970 --> 00:51:10.500
And I said no, actually
it's not on you to do more.

00:51:10.500 --> 00:51:12.450
It was on your
coworkers in that moment

00:51:12.450 --> 00:51:14.010
in their relative
positions of power

00:51:14.010 --> 00:51:16.410
to stand up and
defend you, to create

00:51:16.410 --> 00:51:19.860
the culture in the workplace
that they want to create.

00:51:19.860 --> 00:51:22.080
And I told her the story
has been keeping me alive.

00:51:22.080 --> 00:51:25.980
The story of a Punjabi language
professor here in San Jose.

00:51:25.980 --> 00:51:28.590
After 9/11, all
those years ago, he

00:51:28.590 --> 00:51:32.220
was sitting on a bus in
San Jose on his way home

00:51:32.220 --> 00:51:34.080
from the university.

00:51:34.080 --> 00:51:35.850
He was looking out
the window when

00:51:35.850 --> 00:51:38.610
a man at the front of the bus
stood up, turned around, red

00:51:38.610 --> 00:51:41.910
in the face, and began
pointing at him and saying,

00:51:41.910 --> 00:51:44.310
hey, you f-ing terrorists,
go back to your country.

00:51:44.310 --> 00:51:45.090
Get off this bus.

00:51:45.090 --> 00:51:46.950
Go back to where you come from.

00:51:46.950 --> 00:51:49.020
And my professor wears
a turban and beard,

00:51:49.020 --> 00:51:51.939
looks like my grandfather,
looks out the windows

00:51:51.939 --> 00:51:53.730
and is just praying
for the moment to pass.

00:51:53.730 --> 00:51:54.230
Right?

00:51:54.230 --> 00:51:59.170
What else can he do but
pray for the moment to pass.

00:51:59.170 --> 00:52:02.130
Something remarkable happens.

00:52:02.130 --> 00:52:05.940
The other people on the
bus began to stand up--

00:52:05.940 --> 00:52:09.330
white, black, Latino,
Asian, they stand up.

00:52:09.330 --> 00:52:10.740
And they take this man's arm.

00:52:10.740 --> 00:52:13.560
And they say sit down, sit down.

00:52:13.560 --> 00:52:16.000
And the man sits down.

00:52:16.000 --> 00:52:20.170
The bus comes to a stop and my
professor gets off this bus.

00:52:20.170 --> 00:52:21.779
And the man gets off this bus.

00:52:21.779 --> 00:52:23.320
And the man walks
up to my professor,

00:52:23.320 --> 00:52:24.194
and puts out his arm.

00:52:24.194 --> 00:52:30.340
And at this point, I'm waiting
for the violence to happen.

00:52:30.340 --> 00:52:36.690
But the man takes my professor's
hand and shakes it, and says,

00:52:36.690 --> 00:52:41.160
I just lost my granddaughter
in that second plane that

00:52:41.160 --> 00:52:43.510
went into that second tower.

00:52:43.510 --> 00:52:45.560
I am angry.

00:52:45.560 --> 00:52:46.090
I am sorry.

00:52:49.740 --> 00:52:53.280
What stays with
me from that story

00:52:53.280 --> 00:52:58.670
is that we are the
people on that bus.

00:52:58.670 --> 00:53:02.270
We are the people who in the
most ordinary circumstances,

00:53:02.270 --> 00:53:07.640
in a Google roundtable, in a
conference room here on campus,

00:53:07.640 --> 00:53:11.450
on a bus ride home, in the
streets, in the school yards,

00:53:11.450 --> 00:53:15.110
at our kitchen tables, we
can stand up and do the most

00:53:15.110 --> 00:53:17.990
courageous things to
defend and protect

00:53:17.990 --> 00:53:21.260
people who are in harm's way,
to create the kind of workplace

00:53:21.260 --> 00:53:23.750
culture, but also the
culture in our country

00:53:23.750 --> 00:53:26.430
that we are longing for.

00:53:26.430 --> 00:53:28.690
Each of you has
that warrior in you.

00:53:28.690 --> 00:53:33.000
Each of you has the ability
to stand, to stand up.

00:53:33.000 --> 00:53:35.600
And we will only do this
if we do it together.

00:53:35.600 --> 00:53:36.740
Because here's the truth.

00:53:36.740 --> 00:53:39.367
This is a dark moment
in our country.

00:53:39.367 --> 00:53:40.700
I've been fighting for 15 years.

00:53:40.700 --> 00:53:44.220
I don't know how I'm going to
this explain this to my son.

00:53:44.220 --> 00:53:45.240
I'm touring preschools.

00:53:45.240 --> 00:53:47.220
And I can't even send him to
preschool right now because I

00:53:47.220 --> 00:53:48.970
know the data on
bullying for a little boy

00:53:48.970 --> 00:53:51.540
with long hair who keeps his
hair as part of his faith.

00:53:51.540 --> 00:53:53.322
This a dark moment
for me personally.

00:53:53.322 --> 00:53:54.780
It's a dark moment
for our country.

00:53:54.780 --> 00:53:58.526
And so if this is dark for you,
know that you are not alone.

00:53:58.526 --> 00:54:00.900
And this is the one thing I
leave with you, the one thing

00:54:00.900 --> 00:54:05.310
that I have held onto
as a mother is this.

00:54:05.310 --> 00:54:08.970
What if-- what if
this darkness is not

00:54:08.970 --> 00:54:11.540
the darkness of the tomb?

00:54:11.540 --> 00:54:16.110
What if this darkness is
the darkness of the womb?

00:54:16.110 --> 00:54:19.740
What if our America is
not dead, but a country

00:54:19.740 --> 00:54:21.740
still waiting to be born?

00:54:21.740 --> 00:54:22.240
Right?

00:54:22.240 --> 00:54:25.320
Langston Hughes says let America
be America again, the land that

00:54:25.320 --> 00:54:26.235
has never been.

00:54:26.235 --> 00:54:27.829
It has never been that for me.

00:54:27.829 --> 00:54:30.120
It has never been that for
black folks in this country,

00:54:30.120 --> 00:54:31.350
for indigenous folks.

00:54:31.350 --> 00:54:34.510
The land that has never
been and yet still must be.

00:54:34.510 --> 00:54:37.870
So I swear this oath let
America be America again.

00:54:37.870 --> 00:54:40.320
Let us make it so.

00:54:40.320 --> 00:54:44.100
Because what if this moment is
our nation's great transition?

00:54:44.100 --> 00:54:47.040
What does the
midwife ask us to do?

00:54:47.040 --> 00:54:51.520
She says to breathe.

00:54:51.520 --> 00:54:53.560
And she says to push.

00:54:53.560 --> 00:54:55.780
Because if we don't
push, we will die.

00:54:55.780 --> 00:55:00.130
Like if we don't push, our
nation, our America will die.

00:55:00.130 --> 00:55:02.680
We don't go into battle
alone, there's warriors,

00:55:02.680 --> 00:55:04.510
and we don't give birth alone.

00:55:04.510 --> 00:55:06.820
So I say hold fast
to one another.

00:55:06.820 --> 00:55:10.090
Hold fast to your coworkers,
your family, your friends.

00:55:10.090 --> 00:55:12.579
Hold fast to one another
as brothers and sisters

00:55:12.579 --> 00:55:13.120
in the fight.

00:55:13.120 --> 00:55:15.400
Help one another stand
up when you need to.

00:55:15.400 --> 00:55:17.920
Help one another
breathe and push.

00:55:17.920 --> 00:55:19.774
And then breathe and then push.

00:55:19.774 --> 00:55:21.690
And then keep breathing
and then keep pushing.

00:55:21.690 --> 00:55:23.305
[APPLAUSE]

00:55:23.305 --> 00:55:24.180
LORRIE MA: All right.

00:55:28.170 --> 00:55:32.610
So I know that we have a ton
of questions that are brewing.

00:55:32.610 --> 00:55:36.210
So for those of you who are
here, if you have any questions

00:55:36.210 --> 00:55:38.680
and are live, we'll
take live questions.

00:55:38.680 --> 00:55:40.484
Feel free to line up at the mic.

00:55:44.380 --> 00:55:45.160
Go ahead.

00:55:45.160 --> 00:55:47.410
AUDIENCE: Thanks to the three
of you for coming today.

00:55:47.410 --> 00:55:49.750
Thanks to AGN for organizing.

00:55:49.750 --> 00:55:53.160
My heart's still kind of
racing from all the stories.

00:55:53.160 --> 00:55:57.090
I've had the opportunity
to lead with others

00:55:57.090 --> 00:55:59.980
an online community,
anonymous user names all

00:55:59.980 --> 00:56:03.010
that for Asian Americans.

00:56:03.010 --> 00:56:05.519
And we wanted it to
be like a safe space

00:56:05.519 --> 00:56:07.810
where people talk about things
that they don't normally

00:56:07.810 --> 00:56:09.410
get to talk about.

00:56:09.410 --> 00:56:11.710
And it worked up to an extent.

00:56:11.710 --> 00:56:14.070
But what we found over
time is that there

00:56:14.070 --> 00:56:15.540
is a lot of infighting.

00:56:15.540 --> 00:56:20.150
Like there was like the
gender between genders,

00:56:20.150 --> 00:56:21.680
so-and-so stood
up for Asian men,

00:56:21.680 --> 00:56:23.920
but she's married
to a white man,

00:56:23.920 --> 00:56:25.990
so she can't speak
for Asian men.

00:56:25.990 --> 00:56:28.930
Or so-and-so is mixed race,
we don't consider them

00:56:28.930 --> 00:56:30.250
as part of the community.

00:56:30.250 --> 00:56:33.040
East Asians versus South Asians.

00:56:33.040 --> 00:56:36.250
How can we get past all that
and focus on a higher level

00:56:36.250 --> 00:56:39.490
and stand together as
a community online,

00:56:39.490 --> 00:56:42.130
in person, just in general?

00:56:44.994 --> 00:56:47.660
PHIL YU: As someone who spends a
great deal, quite a bit of time

00:56:47.660 --> 00:56:51.815
online, and also receives
quite a bit of criticism

00:56:51.815 --> 00:56:56.870
online from anonymous
folks, I can only

00:56:56.870 --> 00:56:59.840
say that like in terms
of the infighting of like

00:56:59.840 --> 00:57:03.062
who gets to say what--
like all that stuff gets

00:57:03.062 --> 00:57:05.270
in the way of actually
accomplishing anything, right?

00:57:05.270 --> 00:57:08.840
It's like criticizing the voice
that it comes from where you're

00:57:08.840 --> 00:57:10.850
saying like this
person gets to be Asian

00:57:10.850 --> 00:57:14.450
and this person does not is like
what good does that do anybody?

00:57:14.450 --> 00:57:17.060
Honestly.

00:57:17.060 --> 00:57:20.840
I am really an
opponent of people

00:57:20.840 --> 00:57:24.980
who are policing Asian
American identities.

00:57:24.980 --> 00:57:27.200
Asian American identities
are like whoever

00:57:27.200 --> 00:57:30.380
identifies as Asian American,
that's who you are, man.

00:57:30.380 --> 00:57:33.590
I'm sick of people saying
like this person is Asian.

00:57:33.590 --> 00:57:36.900
This person is biracial so
they are not fully Asian.

00:57:36.900 --> 00:57:38.540
That's complete bullshit.

00:57:38.540 --> 00:57:42.140
This community has
enough problems as it is.

00:57:42.140 --> 00:57:43.640
And we're going to
start dividing up

00:57:43.640 --> 00:57:44.930
like who gets to say what?

00:57:44.930 --> 00:57:47.270
Whose voice is more valid?

00:57:47.270 --> 00:57:50.120
So that's kind of what I have
to say about that in terms

00:57:50.120 --> 00:57:52.490
of policing these voices.

00:57:52.490 --> 00:57:54.830
But the other side
of that is like we

00:57:54.830 --> 00:57:56.750
have to find common
ground about the things

00:57:56.750 --> 00:58:01.110
like deciding who gets to fight
on our behalf, that actually

00:58:01.110 --> 00:58:03.270
doesn't get to the
actual fighting part.

00:58:03.270 --> 00:58:05.219
I mean that's just
still fighting about who

00:58:05.219 --> 00:58:06.260
gets to be our spokesman.

00:58:06.260 --> 00:58:07.490
It's like you know what?

00:58:07.490 --> 00:58:08.490
I don't want spokesmen.

00:58:08.490 --> 00:58:10.590
I want people to just be
the ones who do the work

00:58:10.590 --> 00:58:14.170
and be the ones engaged
in the fight, you know?

00:58:14.170 --> 00:58:16.530
And you're talking
about online spaces.

00:58:16.530 --> 00:58:19.460
Like I work in the online
space, but I am the first one

00:58:19.460 --> 00:58:22.670
to acknowledge that
only gets you so far.

00:58:22.670 --> 00:58:26.900
Like the work that I do, it
only starts a conversation.

00:58:26.900 --> 00:58:28.370
I'm not actually--

00:58:28.370 --> 00:58:32.090
I'll be the first one to
say the real work gets

00:58:32.090 --> 00:58:35.900
done when people get together
and start talking offline.

00:58:35.900 --> 00:58:40.250
Online is super
powerful and important.

00:58:40.250 --> 00:58:43.910
The message boards, and
stuff like that, Twitter,

00:58:43.910 --> 00:58:45.140
powerful, powerful tools.

00:58:47.930 --> 00:58:49.910
And I love the work
that I do as a blogger

00:58:49.910 --> 00:58:50.941
from behind my laptop.

00:58:50.941 --> 00:58:52.940
But it's really when we
come to spaces like this

00:58:52.940 --> 00:58:55.482
and we're having conversations
face-to-face where

00:58:55.482 --> 00:58:57.140
things actually get done.

00:58:57.140 --> 00:59:00.350
That's when the pot
really gets stirred.

00:59:00.350 --> 00:59:02.990
So I'm sorry about
the online people,

00:59:02.990 --> 00:59:04.959
like the trolls, and
everything like that.

00:59:04.959 --> 00:59:06.500
But it's not just
trolls, just people

00:59:06.500 --> 00:59:08.270
having different opinions.

00:59:08.270 --> 00:59:12.090
I think that we ought to
look at what we're actually

00:59:12.090 --> 00:59:13.080
fighting about.

00:59:13.080 --> 00:59:18.877
The stuff we're bickering about
actually is not productive.

00:59:18.877 --> 00:59:19.460
LORRIE MA: OK.

00:59:19.460 --> 00:59:21.630
We'll take another
live question.

00:59:21.630 --> 00:59:23.630
Then we'll go to the DORY.

00:59:23.630 --> 00:59:26.480
AUDIENCE: So I'm a first
generation immigrant

00:59:26.480 --> 00:59:28.240
in the US for 15 years.

00:59:28.240 --> 00:59:32.540
And I'm your typical Asian guy
who doesn't look into politics,

00:59:32.540 --> 00:59:35.300
and stick my head down,
no bubble in California

00:59:35.300 --> 00:59:38.250
in Bay Area in Google.

00:59:38.250 --> 00:59:42.490
I guess I have a son now in San
Jose that's five months old.

00:59:42.490 --> 00:59:44.625
I feel he's going to feel
like one of you guys.

00:59:44.625 --> 00:59:47.360
Like he's going to grow up and
feel like he's really American

00:59:47.360 --> 00:59:49.166
and all these
injustices to Asians

00:59:49.166 --> 00:59:50.620
are happening in this country.

00:59:50.620 --> 00:59:51.196
Right?

00:59:51.196 --> 00:59:52.355
I'm like what's going on?

00:59:52.355 --> 00:59:53.730
Like why are you
guys so worried?

00:59:53.730 --> 00:59:56.250
So I'm honest.

00:59:56.250 --> 00:59:57.440
Like I read the columnist.

00:59:57.440 --> 01:00:00.540
I read "New York Times,"
about the major US

01:00:00.540 --> 01:00:02.979
racial issues are on the
Muslims right now, right?

01:00:02.979 --> 01:00:04.770
I really want to know
number one if you can

01:00:04.770 --> 01:00:06.660
answer this question directly.

01:00:06.660 --> 01:00:09.310
Because like all the guys
have resonated with the talk.

01:00:09.310 --> 01:00:11.880
But for me, half the talk,
I did not resonate on.

01:00:11.880 --> 01:00:13.230
Like all these men in his
history and stuff like that.

01:00:13.230 --> 01:00:14.030
It happened.

01:00:14.030 --> 01:00:15.550
I don't have a parent that's
suffered through this.

01:00:15.550 --> 01:00:17.841
I don't have a Japanese parent
who went to intern camp.

01:00:17.841 --> 01:00:20.700
I don't have a
Vietnamese parent, right?

01:00:20.700 --> 01:00:24.360
And China and US actually
were close in history?

01:00:24.360 --> 01:00:26.850
So I'm Taiwanese, too,
my parents are Taiwanese.

01:00:26.850 --> 01:00:28.600
So my question is
number one directly like

01:00:28.600 --> 01:00:31.400
will there be issues
today that I as an Asian--

01:00:31.400 --> 01:00:33.210
I was born in the
US, that's the irony.

01:00:33.210 --> 01:00:35.640
But I'm raised in Asia.

01:00:35.640 --> 01:00:37.439
So what is a
current topic that I

01:00:37.439 --> 01:00:38.730
need to be paying attention to?

01:00:38.730 --> 01:00:40.646
Number two, what is a
good media source for me

01:00:40.646 --> 01:00:42.230
to educate myself?

01:00:42.230 --> 01:00:47.010
And number three what can I
do to understand my son better

01:00:47.010 --> 01:00:48.270
when he grows up?

01:00:48.270 --> 01:00:50.165
So three questions, thank you.

01:00:50.165 --> 01:00:51.620
[LAUGHTER]

01:00:51.620 --> 01:00:53.196
LORRIE MA: It's a lot.

01:00:53.196 --> 01:00:54.912
VALARIE KAUR: It is a lot.

01:00:54.912 --> 01:00:56.370
QUYEN DINH: I feel
like we all want

01:00:56.370 --> 01:01:01.590
to share something, so thank
you for being really honest.

01:01:01.590 --> 01:01:05.490
I think that actually one of
the reasons why our community is

01:01:05.490 --> 01:01:08.430
so complex is because
we are comprised

01:01:08.430 --> 01:01:14.700
of multiple generations of
Asians to this country, right?

01:01:14.700 --> 01:01:16.720
I think the biggest issue--

01:01:16.720 --> 01:01:19.470
there are so many, but
I would say immigration.

01:01:19.470 --> 01:01:23.280
We are all here because
of immigration policy.

01:01:23.280 --> 01:01:26.940
And we have been benefited
because of the 1965 Immigration

01:01:26.940 --> 01:01:28.220
Nationality Act.

01:01:28.220 --> 01:01:32.100
This is a huge transition from
the Chinese Exclusion Act.

01:01:32.100 --> 01:01:38.580
And now, our country
is shifting in being

01:01:38.580 --> 01:01:45.130
the most closed off it has ever
been historically as a country.

01:01:45.130 --> 01:01:49.510
And as a community that has so
benefited from these policies,

01:01:49.510 --> 01:01:51.400
I really believe it's
our responsibility

01:01:51.400 --> 01:01:52.990
to protect that legacy.

01:01:52.990 --> 01:01:57.340
So if it's one issue, I'm
going to say immigration.

01:01:57.340 --> 01:01:58.870
News sources?

01:01:58.870 --> 01:02:00.610
I think you just have
to be really smart

01:02:00.610 --> 01:02:02.590
and be a really good
critical thinker.

01:02:02.590 --> 01:02:04.540
Which is why I really
think critical thinking

01:02:04.540 --> 01:02:08.396
skills are important to
teach at the K-12 level.

01:02:08.396 --> 01:02:09.895
But folks might
have other insights.

01:02:09.895 --> 01:02:19.160
And in terms of
your son, I think

01:02:19.160 --> 01:02:21.800
having conversations
with him that maybe you

01:02:21.800 --> 01:02:28.520
weren't allowed to have,
and just listening to him,

01:02:28.520 --> 01:02:35.030
and recognizing that
you are a part of him.

01:02:35.030 --> 01:02:38.120
And he will continue
your legacy.

01:02:38.120 --> 01:02:41.500
He'll be probably different
from all of us actually.

01:02:41.500 --> 01:02:43.340
But that you have given
him this opportunity

01:02:43.340 --> 01:02:47.330
to define a new identity,
a new self for himself

01:02:47.330 --> 01:02:49.060
and so support that.

01:02:53.970 --> 01:02:56.760
PHIL YU: My daughter is seven
months old, my first child.

01:02:56.760 --> 01:03:00.480
And my question is
same as yours about

01:03:00.480 --> 01:03:01.710
like how will she grow up.

01:03:01.710 --> 01:03:07.620
And I hope that she'd be a
woke ass Asian American woman,

01:03:07.620 --> 01:03:08.540
you know.

01:03:11.300 --> 01:03:13.230
To touch upon something
you said in terms

01:03:13.230 --> 01:03:15.270
of like I don't relate
to this-- and like look.

01:03:15.270 --> 01:03:16.440
I'm Korean American.

01:03:16.440 --> 01:03:19.110
I've gone through relatively
little personal struggle

01:03:19.110 --> 01:03:20.370
in my life.

01:03:20.370 --> 01:03:23.700
But when I said I became
Asian American, that

01:03:23.700 --> 01:03:25.470
means my struggle
became her struggle,

01:03:25.470 --> 01:03:27.120
my struggle became her struggle.

01:03:27.120 --> 01:03:30.450
You know adopting
that mentality really

01:03:30.450 --> 01:03:33.420
is what drives me and
drives the work that I do.

01:03:33.420 --> 01:03:38.090
And so I know a lot of people
will fall back on that thing,

01:03:38.090 --> 01:03:38.970
I can't relate.

01:03:38.970 --> 01:03:40.169
And that's not really--

01:03:40.169 --> 01:03:42.210
I mean, I feel sorry for
you, but I don't relate.

01:03:42.210 --> 01:03:44.585
But at some point-- and I'm
going to paraphrase something

01:03:44.585 --> 01:03:45.950
that someone told me.

01:03:45.950 --> 01:03:49.710
At some point you got to ask
yourself are you interested

01:03:49.710 --> 01:03:52.380
in justice or just us?

01:03:52.380 --> 01:03:55.720
And you have to define
what just us is.

01:03:55.720 --> 01:03:58.800
So when I adopted Asian
American as my identity,

01:03:58.800 --> 01:04:01.449
that's what I took
on, that us part.

01:04:01.449 --> 01:04:02.240
VALARIE KAUR: Yeah.

01:04:02.240 --> 01:04:04.830
Our destinies are intertwined.

01:04:04.830 --> 01:04:07.710
And therefore I can't
give you a single issue.

01:04:10.950 --> 01:04:13.920
Leading with love
means acknowledging

01:04:13.920 --> 01:04:17.450
that everyone's struggle is
intertwined with our own.

01:04:17.450 --> 01:04:19.620
That I cannot live
if you are dying.

01:04:19.620 --> 01:04:22.100
I cannot stand by if
you are suffering.

01:04:22.100 --> 01:04:23.350
What does that mean right now?

01:04:23.350 --> 01:04:24.933
What does it mean
to respond with love

01:04:24.933 --> 01:04:28.920
when so many communities
are in harm's way?

01:04:28.920 --> 01:04:31.110
I mean just even looking
at the first Executive

01:04:31.110 --> 01:04:33.120
Orders the first week
of this Administration,

01:04:33.120 --> 01:04:35.460
we had an Executive
Order that build

01:04:35.460 --> 01:04:39.000
a wall along our southern
border, that punished sanctuary

01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:43.140
cities for offering refuge to
undocumented immigrants, that

01:04:43.140 --> 01:04:45.120
started the construction
of pipelines

01:04:45.120 --> 01:04:49.440
on indigenous sacred lands,
that repealed sections

01:04:49.440 --> 01:04:53.000
of the Affordable Care Act,
that now have enacted now

01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:55.650
the second version of the
Muslim ban that affects not just

01:04:55.650 --> 01:04:57.750
immigrants and refugees
but Muslims and Sikhs

01:04:57.750 --> 01:04:59.490
and others in this country.

01:04:59.490 --> 01:05:01.230
And now we have promises
of voting rights

01:05:01.230 --> 01:05:04.540
and criminal justice
and mass incarceration.

01:05:04.540 --> 01:05:07.920
But everything will be
affected by this Administration

01:05:07.920 --> 01:05:09.760
and these policies.

01:05:09.760 --> 01:05:13.200
And so, to stand next to my
Latino brothers and sisters,

01:05:13.200 --> 01:05:15.850
and my indigenous brothers and
sisters, and my black brothers

01:05:15.850 --> 01:05:17.850
and sisters, and my Muslim
brothers and sisters,

01:05:17.850 --> 01:05:19.200
and my Asian American brothers--

01:05:19.200 --> 01:05:21.900
I know that sounds exhausting.

01:05:21.900 --> 01:05:24.780
I know what does it look like
each day if all of our issues

01:05:24.780 --> 01:05:28.470
are interconnected and we are
in an intersectional moment?

01:05:28.470 --> 01:05:30.930
And that the only way to fight
for a movement of justice

01:05:30.930 --> 01:05:33.840
now is to know that
we fight together.

01:05:33.840 --> 01:05:37.020
I think that means
deciding how you show up

01:05:37.020 --> 01:05:38.940
in your daily and weekly life.

01:05:38.940 --> 01:05:40.980
So what I'm telling
you is that what

01:05:40.980 --> 01:05:43.980
it means to be an engaged
citizen in America today

01:05:43.980 --> 01:05:46.260
is to call Congress once a day.

01:05:46.260 --> 01:05:47.730
Yes, once a day.

01:05:47.730 --> 01:05:50.990
Like I have the number on
speed dial on my phone.

01:05:50.990 --> 01:05:52.290
I call once a day.

01:05:52.290 --> 01:05:53.330
And I look at the news.

01:05:53.330 --> 01:05:55.663
It's the New York Times," the
same thing you're reading.

01:05:55.663 --> 01:05:57.630
And whatever community
is in harm's way--

01:05:57.630 --> 01:06:00.000
I mean there are so many--
but right now I choose one.

01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:02.024
And I call my senator
or a representative

01:06:02.024 --> 01:06:04.440
and I tell them I stand in
solidarity with that community,

01:06:04.440 --> 01:06:07.080
stand up, be emboldened
to stand up with me.

01:06:07.080 --> 01:06:08.130
Once a day.

01:06:08.130 --> 01:06:10.320
It means once a week or
once every two weeks,

01:06:10.320 --> 01:06:13.680
showing up to the march,
showing up to the vigil,

01:06:13.680 --> 01:06:16.254
showing up in community not
just online, but in person.

01:06:16.254 --> 01:06:17.670
That's what
solidarity looks like.

01:06:17.670 --> 01:06:19.110
That's what love looks like.

01:06:19.110 --> 01:06:22.200
And if you start to take
your son to these places,

01:06:22.200 --> 01:06:24.420
you don't have to do
very much, because he'll

01:06:24.420 --> 01:06:27.570
be hearing the stories and
having the conversations

01:06:27.570 --> 01:06:29.190
that you didn't get to have.

01:06:29.190 --> 01:06:31.026
And you'll be learning from him.

01:06:31.026 --> 01:06:32.400
Because in order
to love someone,

01:06:32.400 --> 01:06:34.620
you all need to answer
three questions--

01:06:34.620 --> 01:06:36.120
who are you?

01:06:36.120 --> 01:06:38.040
What is at stake for you?

01:06:38.040 --> 01:06:39.550
What is my role in
your flourishing?

01:06:39.550 --> 01:06:40.920
What is your role in mine?

01:06:40.920 --> 01:06:42.300
Number one is who are you?

01:06:42.300 --> 01:06:44.730
Every day I look
into my son's eyes.

01:06:44.730 --> 01:06:47.340
Phil's daughter is
seven months old.

01:06:47.340 --> 01:06:49.660
My son is two years old.

01:06:49.660 --> 01:06:51.300
He is changing every day.

01:06:51.300 --> 01:06:53.880
Every day I have to
ask him who are you?

01:06:53.880 --> 01:06:55.290
What is at stake for you?

01:06:55.290 --> 01:06:56.880
What is my role in
your flourishing

01:06:56.880 --> 01:06:58.131
and what is your role in mine?

01:06:58.131 --> 01:06:59.588
He didn't want me
to get on a plane

01:06:59.588 --> 01:07:01.950
to come over here today and
spend a day away from him.

01:07:01.950 --> 01:07:03.480
But he has a role
in my flourishing

01:07:03.480 --> 01:07:05.970
which is to allow his
mommy to be her best self.

01:07:05.970 --> 01:07:08.649
So we are tied together.

01:07:08.649 --> 01:07:10.440
Not just our communities,
but our families,

01:07:10.440 --> 01:07:12.270
and our collective flourishing.

01:07:12.270 --> 01:07:15.450
So if you do that, if you
take your son to these places,

01:07:15.450 --> 01:07:17.130
if you ask him these
questions, if you

01:07:17.130 --> 01:07:18.960
start to create the
culture that you

01:07:18.960 --> 01:07:20.820
want for the country
in your own home,

01:07:20.820 --> 01:07:23.035
then you're part
of the good fight?

01:07:23.035 --> 01:07:24.035
AUDIENCE: Great answers.

01:07:24.035 --> 01:07:25.260
Thank you.

01:07:25.260 --> 01:07:27.300
LORRIE MA: We'll take a
question from the DORY.

01:07:30.190 --> 01:07:32.550
So it says what
work if any have you

01:07:32.550 --> 01:07:34.650
seen in regards to
diversity inclusion

01:07:34.650 --> 01:07:36.390
for Southeast Asian groups?

01:07:36.390 --> 01:07:39.121
Because quote "Asian"
is used so broadly,

01:07:39.121 --> 01:07:41.370
often there is little attention
given to the increased

01:07:41.370 --> 01:07:44.100
representation for more
under-represented groups whose

01:07:44.100 --> 01:07:48.080
experiences can
be very different.

01:07:48.080 --> 01:07:50.810
QUYEN DINH: And is this
in particular to Google?

01:07:53.690 --> 01:07:55.310
LORRIE MA: Feel free
to speak to who.

01:07:55.310 --> 01:07:57.560
QUYEN DINH: Let's start with
Google, since we're here.

01:07:57.560 --> 01:07:59.870
We're having this really
courageous conversation

01:07:59.870 --> 01:08:02.120
about race, right?

01:08:02.120 --> 01:08:04.310
I think the first
step is actually

01:08:04.310 --> 01:08:08.300
recognizing that
there's a problem

01:08:08.300 --> 01:08:11.510
and really owning
that inequity exists

01:08:11.510 --> 01:08:13.910
within the Asian
American community,

01:08:13.910 --> 01:08:17.910
especially around
socioeconomic outcomes.

01:08:17.910 --> 01:08:21.350
And by starting with Google,
one really simple thing

01:08:21.350 --> 01:08:25.760
could be trying to collect this
aggregated data on the Google

01:08:25.760 --> 01:08:26.930
community.

01:08:26.930 --> 01:08:30.851
So of the-- how many Asian
American Google folks

01:08:30.851 --> 01:08:31.350
are there?

01:08:31.350 --> 01:08:32.149
Googlers are there?

01:08:32.149 --> 01:08:33.590
LORRIE MA: I don't know
if we have those numbers.

01:08:33.590 --> 01:08:34.465
PHIL YU: Hello bunch.

01:08:34.465 --> 01:08:35.961
[LAUGHTER]

01:08:35.961 --> 01:08:38.569
QUYEN DINH: Of the hella
bunch Asian American folks,

01:08:38.569 --> 01:08:42.350
or folks who identify as
Asian, how many are Vietnamese?

01:08:42.350 --> 01:08:43.162
How many are Hmong?

01:08:43.162 --> 01:08:44.120
How many are Cambodian?

01:08:44.120 --> 01:08:45.020
How many are Lao?

01:08:45.020 --> 01:08:46.729
How many are Taiwanese?

01:08:46.729 --> 01:08:48.200
How many are Thai?

01:08:48.200 --> 01:08:50.010
How many are Malaysian?

01:08:50.010 --> 01:08:54.160
And I share that because the
Asian American community is not

01:08:54.160 --> 01:08:54.660
the same.

01:08:54.660 --> 01:08:55.970
We're not a monolith.

01:08:55.970 --> 01:09:00.109
And when I try to recruit
for positions at SEARAC

01:09:00.109 --> 01:09:02.479
where we're trying
to pass legislation.

01:09:02.479 --> 01:09:06.470
We're building grassroots
movements and community

01:09:06.470 --> 01:09:09.859
building across the
country, I struggle

01:09:09.859 --> 01:09:13.609
to find folks with a
master's degree or a master's

01:09:13.609 --> 01:09:15.680
in public policy or a
master's in social work

01:09:15.680 --> 01:09:17.120
who are a Southeast Asian.

01:09:17.120 --> 01:09:18.800
Because the reality
is that two in three

01:09:18.800 --> 01:09:22.370
Southeast Asian Americans
don't have a college degree.

01:09:22.370 --> 01:09:26.689
And so you see that manifested
on the professional level

01:09:26.689 --> 01:09:29.060
in different industries where
communities are actually

01:09:29.060 --> 01:09:30.240
represented.

01:09:30.240 --> 01:09:33.800
And I think starting there with
really recognizing that there

01:09:33.800 --> 01:09:35.974
is a problem is the first step.

01:09:39.127 --> 01:09:40.960
LORRIE MA: Let's take
another live question.

01:09:40.960 --> 01:09:41.410
AUDIENCE: Great.

01:09:41.410 --> 01:09:42.910
Thank you everyone
for coming today.

01:09:42.910 --> 01:09:45.220
So I have a question more
about personal identity.

01:09:45.220 --> 01:09:47.854
I was born in the US,
but I grew up in Taiwan,

01:09:47.854 --> 01:09:49.270
but I'm at a
bilingual school that

01:09:49.270 --> 01:09:52.430
taught both American
and Chinese history.

01:09:52.430 --> 01:09:55.210
And I had most of my career
in the United States.

01:09:55.210 --> 01:09:57.647
So I don't really
know what I am.

01:09:57.647 --> 01:09:59.230
I don't feel like I
belong in America.

01:09:59.230 --> 01:10:03.070
I don't feel like I belong when
I go back to Taiwan or in Asia.

01:10:03.070 --> 01:10:05.170
And so I've always called
myself Asian American.

01:10:05.170 --> 01:10:07.799
But I don't really feel like
I'm the same as everyone

01:10:07.799 --> 01:10:08.840
else in this room either.

01:10:08.840 --> 01:10:11.050
So I'm just curious from
your personal experience,

01:10:11.050 --> 01:10:14.380
you know, where do you
fit in and how do you

01:10:14.380 --> 01:10:17.090
find that belonging?

01:10:17.090 --> 01:10:20.690
VALARIE KAUR: I just want
to say, I know you're heart.

01:10:20.690 --> 01:10:22.370
So growing up as
a third generation

01:10:22.370 --> 01:10:25.359
Sikh American in the farmlands
of central California--

01:10:25.359 --> 01:10:26.400
what does that look like?

01:10:26.400 --> 01:10:29.690
It means that when I would go
to the gurdwara, the Sikh house

01:10:29.690 --> 01:10:32.300
of worship, there were
mostly immigrant families.

01:10:32.300 --> 01:10:35.780
And I felt like an outsider
to my own Sikh community

01:10:35.780 --> 01:10:38.150
because my father was
born and raised here.

01:10:38.150 --> 01:10:40.340
He went to college
and was part of a frat

01:10:40.340 --> 01:10:44.030
and he named me Valarie
after Valentine's Day,

01:10:44.030 --> 01:10:46.680
not after like anything
I tried to pretend--

01:10:46.680 --> 01:10:47.180
No.

01:10:47.180 --> 01:10:47.680
No.

01:10:47.680 --> 01:10:49.700
But it's after an
American holiday,

01:10:49.700 --> 01:10:51.080
it's not in Sikh scripture.

01:10:51.080 --> 01:10:51.775
So I--

01:10:51.775 --> 01:10:54.080
[LAUGHTER]

01:10:54.080 --> 01:10:56.870
So I felt like an outsider
to my own community.

01:10:56.870 --> 01:11:00.110
And then at school, of
course, predominantly white,

01:11:00.110 --> 01:11:02.140
very conservative,
very Christian,

01:11:02.140 --> 01:11:04.180
I was constantly
called these names,

01:11:04.180 --> 01:11:06.620
but also told that I would
go to hell because I was not

01:11:06.620 --> 01:11:07.160
Christian.

01:11:07.160 --> 01:11:10.460
And so I spent my
entire childhood

01:11:10.460 --> 01:11:14.060
feeling like I was in between,
like I am not fully Sikh

01:11:14.060 --> 01:11:15.170
according to them.

01:11:15.170 --> 01:11:17.960
I'm not fully American
according to them.

01:11:17.960 --> 01:11:20.720
And this in-between
space I felt like I just

01:11:20.720 --> 01:11:22.160
wanted to collapse it.

01:11:22.160 --> 01:11:24.410
I thought about changing my
name to go this direction.

01:11:24.410 --> 01:11:26.100
And I thought about
doing something else

01:11:26.100 --> 01:11:27.300
to go in this direction.

01:11:27.300 --> 01:11:31.730
And finally, it was only
after, really after 9/11,

01:11:31.730 --> 01:11:34.880
and understanding
what I was seeing

01:11:34.880 --> 01:11:38.630
that I recognized this
in-between space that I

01:11:38.630 --> 01:11:39.740
occupied.

01:11:39.740 --> 01:11:42.400
This in-between space
that you're standing in

01:11:42.400 --> 01:11:45.300
is actually a space of
tremendous strength.

01:11:45.300 --> 01:11:48.840
You can see things that
other people can't see.

01:11:48.840 --> 01:11:52.020
You can see things about America
and Taiwan and China that

01:11:52.020 --> 01:11:54.000
others of us in this
room cannot see.

01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:56.010
I can see things that
others cannot see.

01:11:56.010 --> 01:11:59.220
And that means I can tell
stories from this space that

01:11:59.220 --> 01:12:00.750
others cannot tell.

01:12:00.750 --> 01:12:03.570
I can exercise my
voice from this space.

01:12:03.570 --> 01:12:06.030
My best friend tells me speak
even if your voice trembles.

01:12:06.030 --> 01:12:08.940
So even if your voice
is trembling, speak.

01:12:08.940 --> 01:12:11.760
Because your particular
truth is something

01:12:11.760 --> 01:12:15.150
that this country, this
community here on this campus,

01:12:15.150 --> 01:12:16.020
needs.

01:12:16.020 --> 01:12:17.430
We need you.

01:12:17.430 --> 01:12:19.800
So own where you are.

01:12:19.800 --> 01:12:21.900
And also know that
you're not alone

01:12:21.900 --> 01:12:23.940
in where you are,
that so many of us

01:12:23.940 --> 01:12:25.710
are occupying these
in-between spaces.

01:12:25.710 --> 01:12:27.210
A whole generation
of millennials

01:12:27.210 --> 01:12:29.410
are in these in-between spaces.

01:12:29.410 --> 01:12:32.160
And one of the fallacies of
races to put us in these cages,

01:12:32.160 --> 01:12:32.660
right?

01:12:32.660 --> 01:12:34.620
We can break open those cages.

01:12:34.620 --> 01:12:39.000
We can show that America is not
a melting pot, it's a mosaic.

01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:40.650
And it's made up of
all different kinds

01:12:40.650 --> 01:12:43.470
of pieces and histories
and stories and truths.

01:12:43.470 --> 01:12:45.630
And your job is to
let your truth shine.

01:12:45.630 --> 01:12:49.760
Your job is to let
your truth sing.

01:12:49.760 --> 01:12:50.700
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

01:12:50.700 --> 01:12:52.640
PHIL YU: I just
want to add to that.

01:12:52.640 --> 01:12:56.060
There is no corner of
Asian America where

01:12:56.060 --> 01:12:59.885
this diverse, incredible, wide
spanning Asian America, where

01:12:59.885 --> 01:13:02.260
somebody's going to go and
feel like I completely belong,

01:13:02.260 --> 01:13:05.480
like I totally belong here.

01:13:05.480 --> 01:13:06.920
There's a corner
everywhere where

01:13:06.920 --> 01:13:09.320
someone is going to like I
don't feel like I belong.

01:13:09.320 --> 01:13:12.530
And that's kind of
what's awesome about it.

01:13:12.530 --> 01:13:15.799
But I think everyone has
felt like an outsider

01:13:15.799 --> 01:13:17.840
in some space of the space
where they're supposed

01:13:17.840 --> 01:13:19.830
to feel like they belong.

01:13:19.830 --> 01:13:23.240
I think we can all
relate on some level.

01:13:23.240 --> 01:13:24.761
And then ditto
what Valarie said.

01:13:24.761 --> 01:13:28.392
[LAUGHTER]

01:13:28.392 --> 01:13:29.100
LORRIE MA: Great.

01:13:29.100 --> 01:13:30.740
Next.

01:13:30.740 --> 01:13:33.290
AUDIENCE: If you ask most
Americans about the Holocaust,

01:13:33.290 --> 01:13:35.612
everybody knows what it is.

01:13:35.612 --> 01:13:37.070
But if you talk
about Vincent Chin,

01:13:37.070 --> 01:13:38.960
I saw about maybe
20% of the people

01:13:38.960 --> 01:13:41.810
here in this room
raising their hand when

01:13:41.810 --> 01:13:44.150
I talk to people who
are not from California,

01:13:44.150 --> 01:13:47.330
they don't even know about
the Japanese internment.

01:13:47.330 --> 01:13:51.110
What are some of the larger
effort going across the country

01:13:51.110 --> 01:13:54.260
to educate the world at
large, and America at large,

01:13:54.260 --> 01:13:57.520
about the injustice
against Asian Americans

01:13:57.520 --> 01:13:58.586
and the world in general?

01:14:01.270 --> 01:14:03.020
PHIL YU: I don't know
specifically to much

01:14:03.020 --> 01:14:04.880
about education
issues, but I can only

01:14:04.880 --> 01:14:06.380
say from what I
know from people who

01:14:06.380 --> 01:14:09.000
are on the ground doing
some work is that it happens

01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:09.950
on a local level.

01:14:09.950 --> 01:14:13.850
I mean a lot of it
is super motivated

01:14:13.850 --> 01:14:17.420
by people within schools,
within school districts,

01:14:17.420 --> 01:14:18.770
to educate about--

01:14:18.770 --> 01:14:21.727
in California, we have
Fred Korematsu Day.

01:14:21.727 --> 01:14:23.060
That's not a nationwide holiday.

01:14:23.060 --> 01:14:25.100
But it's celebrating
a civil rights

01:14:25.100 --> 01:14:27.235
leader who stood up
to the incarceration

01:14:27.235 --> 01:14:30.272
of Japanese Americans.

01:14:30.272 --> 01:14:33.750
I have a friend of
mine, this couple,

01:14:33.750 --> 01:14:37.340
they have two kids 10 and 11
years old at their school.

01:14:37.340 --> 01:14:39.920
Their school was
celebrating Dr. Seuss week

01:14:39.920 --> 01:14:45.629
in conjunction with National
Book something week, reading

01:14:45.629 --> 01:14:46.670
week, or something right?

01:14:46.670 --> 01:14:49.024
And they're
celebrating Dr. Seuss.

01:14:49.024 --> 01:14:49.940
People love Dr. Seuss.

01:14:49.940 --> 01:14:52.190
But a lot of people don't
know that Dr. Seuss actually

01:14:52.190 --> 01:14:55.460
has a history of making really
racist cartoons during World

01:14:55.460 --> 01:14:57.950
War II against
Japanese Americans,

01:14:57.950 --> 01:15:01.520
painting them as the enemy
in super racist caricature.

01:15:01.520 --> 01:15:03.500
So my friends, their
kids, 10, and 11,

01:15:03.500 --> 01:15:05.570
took it upon themselves--
these are some woke ass

01:15:05.570 --> 01:15:09.050
kids-- they took it upon
themselves to create flyers.

01:15:09.050 --> 01:15:10.970
They designed themselves,
they printed up.

01:15:10.970 --> 01:15:12.928
And they passed it out
at school to their class

01:15:12.928 --> 01:15:15.920
and would say did you know
that Dr. Seuss is racist?

01:15:15.920 --> 01:15:18.320
Did you know that he made
these racist cartoons?

01:15:18.320 --> 01:15:23.400
They got it confiscated by the
teachers and a note home saying

01:15:23.400 --> 01:15:28.280
dear, Mr Wong, while
we appreciate your kids

01:15:28.280 --> 01:15:31.970
taking the initiative
to be socially aware,

01:15:31.970 --> 01:15:34.237
these not allowed.

01:15:34.237 --> 01:15:35.570
But I was like, that is amazing.

01:15:35.570 --> 01:15:41.300
But it took these kids to
provide an alternate point

01:15:41.300 --> 01:15:43.970
of view than just
go along with sort

01:15:43.970 --> 01:15:47.860
of the celebration of this
figure, who most people love

01:15:47.860 --> 01:15:49.460
the work that they know about.

01:15:49.460 --> 01:15:54.085
But I think stuff
like that, that's

01:15:54.085 --> 01:15:55.710
just a really cute
example of something

01:15:55.710 --> 01:15:58.670
that-- but I feel like it takes
efforts like that where people

01:15:58.670 --> 01:16:02.210
start a different
conversation entirely

01:16:02.210 --> 01:16:05.450
where you have to create this
alternate thing than what's

01:16:05.450 --> 01:16:06.690
been ingrained.

01:16:06.690 --> 01:16:08.720
Like I said, I got
super mad about learning

01:16:08.720 --> 01:16:11.246
about Vincent Chin in Ethics
Studies course in college.

01:16:11.246 --> 01:16:14.330
It took getting to college
and definitely not everybody

01:16:14.330 --> 01:16:16.650
gets to take Ethnic
Studies courses.

01:16:16.650 --> 01:16:19.520
And so personally,
if it were up to me,

01:16:19.520 --> 01:16:22.080
I would push for ethnic
studies at the high school,

01:16:22.080 --> 01:16:25.445
junior high level, honestly.

01:16:25.445 --> 01:16:28.330
VALARIE KAUR: So my most
recent social justice issue

01:16:28.330 --> 01:16:29.970
was net neutrality.

01:16:29.970 --> 01:16:33.240
And there were fellow
advocates who'd

01:16:33.240 --> 01:16:35.010
been with me for
many years working

01:16:35.010 --> 01:16:36.600
on hate crimes,
mass incarceration,

01:16:36.600 --> 01:16:38.910
solitary confinement,
immigration, thinking

01:16:38.910 --> 01:16:42.900
what are you doing taking on
the issue of internet freedom

01:16:42.900 --> 01:16:44.070
as a social justice issue?

01:16:44.070 --> 01:16:46.050
I was working here
at Stanford Law.

01:16:46.050 --> 01:16:48.780
And I want to say I felt
so proud of the stand

01:16:48.780 --> 01:16:50.790
Google took on this issue.

01:16:50.790 --> 01:16:53.670
Because I chose net neutrality
as a social justice issue

01:16:53.670 --> 01:16:55.650
because my life as
an activist would not

01:16:55.650 --> 01:16:56.861
be possible without it.

01:16:56.861 --> 01:16:57.360
PHIL YU: No.

01:16:57.360 --> 01:17:00.030
VALARIE KAUR: I had no way
to tell, to show my film,

01:17:00.030 --> 01:17:02.040
if it weren't for the
open and free internet.

01:17:02.040 --> 01:17:04.710
Activists like us, you
wouldn't have a blog,

01:17:04.710 --> 01:17:06.390
we wouldn't have
our calls to action.

01:17:06.390 --> 01:17:08.460
There's a whole generation
of activists now

01:17:08.460 --> 01:17:11.370
who are telling the stories of
Vincent Chin and Balbir Singh

01:17:11.370 --> 01:17:14.130
Sodhi and Srinivas
Kuchibhotla, because

01:17:14.130 --> 01:17:15.990
of the open and free internet.

01:17:15.990 --> 01:17:17.970
And so there are
resources available to you

01:17:17.970 --> 01:17:20.170
now in ways that
they weren't before.

01:17:20.170 --> 01:17:23.250
And the first film that
we made, "Divided We

01:17:23.250 --> 01:17:25.770
Fall" about hate
crimes after 9/11

01:17:25.770 --> 01:17:28.980
also includes history
honoring the Japanese American

01:17:28.980 --> 01:17:30.330
internment.

01:17:30.330 --> 01:17:32.670
And so that film has
been used in classrooms

01:17:32.670 --> 01:17:33.930
all around the country.

01:17:33.930 --> 01:17:35.710
We've made it
available for free.

01:17:35.710 --> 01:17:38.760
So many resources out
there for you online.

01:17:38.760 --> 01:17:41.190
But if you go to
revolutionarylove.net

01:17:41.190 --> 01:17:43.530
you can find this film and
a whole lot of other calls

01:17:43.530 --> 01:17:48.940
to action to help you tell the
stories that need to be told.

01:17:48.940 --> 01:17:51.360
LORRIE MA: We have this
question from the DORY.

01:17:51.360 --> 01:17:54.840
Asian American are the largest
minority group at Google.

01:17:54.840 --> 01:17:57.270
How can we get this group
more involved in the issues

01:17:57.270 --> 01:17:59.460
surrounding more
underrepresented minorities

01:17:59.460 --> 01:18:00.840
at Google?

01:18:00.840 --> 01:18:03.120
On the other side of the
coin, what are the issues

01:18:03.120 --> 01:18:05.010
that Asian American
Googlers needs support

01:18:05.010 --> 01:18:07.322
from from other
underrepresented groups?

01:18:16.470 --> 01:18:18.050
QUYEN DINH: So this is an--

01:18:18.050 --> 01:18:18.550
go ahead.

01:18:18.550 --> 01:18:19.050
PHIL YU: No.

01:18:19.050 --> 01:18:19.550
Ah.

01:18:19.550 --> 01:18:22.050
[LAUGHTER]

01:18:24.972 --> 01:18:28.970
On the question of how do we get
other Asian American involved?

01:18:28.970 --> 01:18:32.150
Like that's the question that
is asked of me by every student

01:18:32.150 --> 01:18:32.975
group on every--

01:18:32.975 --> 01:18:34.850
Asian American student
group on every campus.

01:18:34.850 --> 01:18:37.070
How do I get the Asian
American on this campus

01:18:37.070 --> 01:18:39.560
to give a shit about what
we give a shit about?

01:18:39.560 --> 01:18:43.050
It's like the problem is that
you can't get someone else,

01:18:43.050 --> 01:18:46.340
you can't care on their behalf,
like you've got to get them--

01:18:46.340 --> 01:18:49.940
they have to come around
to being the ones who move.

01:18:49.940 --> 01:18:53.212
So you can do all that
mobilizing you want,

01:18:53.212 --> 01:18:54.920
at some point it has
to be the initiative

01:18:54.920 --> 01:18:56.390
from within the individual.

01:18:56.390 --> 01:19:00.080
There's no secret
link that's going

01:19:00.080 --> 01:19:04.290
to trick somebody into caring.

01:19:04.290 --> 01:19:06.057
So I don't know.

01:19:06.057 --> 01:19:07.640
I don't know what
it takes in terms of

01:19:07.640 --> 01:19:10.250
like how do I get
people to care?

01:19:10.250 --> 01:19:12.639
Like they have to care.

01:19:12.639 --> 01:19:14.430
I don't know what magic
key there is to it.

01:19:17.040 --> 01:19:17.540
OK.

01:19:17.540 --> 01:19:18.837
Yeah.

01:19:18.837 --> 01:19:20.420
VALARIE KAUR: Well
I was just thinking

01:19:20.420 --> 01:19:22.003
about how you are
like you have to opt

01:19:22.003 --> 01:19:23.900
into Asian American
identity, right?

01:19:23.900 --> 01:19:26.360
And if your definition
of Asian American

01:19:26.360 --> 01:19:30.560
includes me, that means
when I'm at the vigil

01:19:30.560 --> 01:19:33.264
and I'm burying my people,
cremating my people,

01:19:33.264 --> 01:19:35.180
you're going to be right
there with me, right?

01:19:35.180 --> 01:19:39.410
Because you see me as
part of who you are.

01:19:39.410 --> 01:19:43.940
And the way to do that, the way
to see one another as brothers

01:19:43.940 --> 01:19:48.810
and sisters so that we
care is through stories.

01:19:48.810 --> 01:19:51.415
That is the only magic
key I found in my 15 years

01:19:51.415 --> 01:19:52.040
as an activist.

01:19:52.040 --> 01:19:54.710
It was never the lawsuit or
the Op Ed or the sound bite.

01:19:54.710 --> 01:19:57.590
It was always
telling a story that

01:19:57.590 --> 01:20:03.600
made people see what it
is like through our eyes,

01:20:03.600 --> 01:20:05.490
feel what we feel.

01:20:05.490 --> 01:20:08.640
I saw so many of you wipe
away tears when some of us

01:20:08.640 --> 01:20:10.440
were telling these stories.

01:20:10.440 --> 01:20:14.680
If you feel what we feel that
stories can cultivate empathy,

01:20:14.680 --> 01:20:16.680
and stories can cultivate
that kind of empathy

01:20:16.680 --> 01:20:21.180
required to inspire
action, collective action.

01:20:21.180 --> 01:20:23.730
I don't think we get Asian
Americans to stand up out

01:20:23.730 --> 01:20:26.160
of a sense of duty
or obligation.

01:20:26.160 --> 01:20:28.302
Love is not an
exchange economy, I'll

01:20:28.302 --> 01:20:29.760
do it for you so
that you'll do it.

01:20:29.760 --> 01:20:32.610
No, it's like the
call to love is

01:20:32.610 --> 01:20:34.329
to ask one another who are you?

01:20:34.329 --> 01:20:36.120
And the best way to
ask one another who are

01:20:36.120 --> 01:20:39.426
is to hear each other's stories,
to be moved by one another,

01:20:39.426 --> 01:20:41.800
and then show up for one
another when we need each other.

01:20:41.800 --> 01:20:45.480
So the fact that we're
having forums like this where

01:20:45.480 --> 01:20:48.930
a lot of this is testimony
asking you to be with us

01:20:48.930 --> 01:20:52.350
and hearing you so that we
can be with you through films,

01:20:52.350 --> 01:20:55.830
through roundtables, online,
on the ground, in person.

01:20:55.830 --> 01:20:57.930
The more that the
companies like Google

01:20:57.930 --> 01:21:00.240
invest in that
kind of work, then

01:21:00.240 --> 01:21:04.030
we won't be pulling teeth
to get people to show up,

01:21:04.030 --> 01:21:05.112
we'll just be showing up.

01:21:05.112 --> 01:21:05.820
QUYEN DINH: Yeah.

01:21:05.820 --> 01:21:08.290
I was going to say, this
is a Google question.

01:21:08.290 --> 01:21:10.800
This is a Google conversation.

01:21:10.800 --> 01:21:14.145
I can't pretend to know
what happens on this campus.

01:21:14.145 --> 01:21:16.500
I am in a totally different
world, where I'm like,

01:21:16.500 --> 01:21:19.270
OK, I don't know why my
Google Drive file was

01:21:19.270 --> 01:21:20.740
like duplicating,
but like that's

01:21:20.740 --> 01:21:23.680
like the extent my relationship.

01:21:23.680 --> 01:21:28.300
You all-- and the way that
I think about advocacy

01:21:28.300 --> 01:21:30.490
is really about
owning your story

01:21:30.490 --> 01:21:34.810
and really starting there,
And having not this discussion

01:21:34.810 --> 01:21:37.060
with us as panelists, but
having a discussion with you

01:21:37.060 --> 01:21:41.560
all as a community to understand
who you are, what you care

01:21:41.560 --> 01:21:44.590
about, what are the challenges
that you experience,

01:21:44.590 --> 01:21:47.830
and also what are the challenges
that other people of color

01:21:47.830 --> 01:21:49.510
experience at Google.

01:21:49.510 --> 01:21:54.830
Where is their common
passion and love?

01:21:54.830 --> 01:21:58.510
And it's not going to happen
with one conversation or two

01:21:58.510 --> 01:21:59.650
or three.

01:21:59.650 --> 01:22:01.020
But it will.

01:22:01.020 --> 01:22:03.550
It will happen if there
is that commitment

01:22:03.550 --> 01:22:08.000
to really understanding
who we are as a community.

01:22:08.000 --> 01:22:11.332
LORRIE MA: Great We have
two more live questions.

01:22:14.224 --> 01:22:17.360
AUDIENCE: I think I'm
going to break this.

01:22:17.360 --> 01:22:18.820
I have so many
things on my mind,

01:22:18.820 --> 01:22:22.220
I'll try to pose my question
as clearly as I can.

01:22:22.220 --> 01:22:23.900
So during the
election, I happened

01:22:23.900 --> 01:22:26.270
to meet a couple of
people like Uber drivers

01:22:26.270 --> 01:22:28.370
and they were Trump supporters.

01:22:28.370 --> 01:22:31.640
And I asked them why had
they voted for Trump.

01:22:31.640 --> 01:22:33.200
The answer was very common.

01:22:33.200 --> 01:22:35.866
And there was one thing that was
very common and similar to what

01:22:35.866 --> 01:22:39.350
Phil had mentioned that
immigrants had taken jobs

01:22:39.350 --> 01:22:39.900
from them.

01:22:42.450 --> 01:22:46.680
My personal opinion, I pay
shitloads of taxes every year,

01:22:46.680 --> 01:22:49.650
but I just didn't have
the facts to explain

01:22:49.650 --> 01:22:51.090
to them that this is not true.

01:22:51.090 --> 01:22:54.210
And this was a question for me
as well, is this actually true?

01:22:54.210 --> 01:22:57.000
If she's a mother of two
and she doesn't have money

01:22:57.000 --> 01:22:57.840
to feed her kids.

01:22:57.840 --> 01:23:00.090
And somebody who
has the authority

01:23:00.090 --> 01:23:02.580
is feeding to her that
all immigrants have

01:23:02.580 --> 01:23:05.640
taken over the job and that's
why you don't have money.

01:23:05.640 --> 01:23:07.960
I wonder these kind
of forums are good,

01:23:07.960 --> 01:23:09.930
but is there any
platform for people

01:23:09.930 --> 01:23:12.690
who actually think that
that is the reason that they

01:23:12.690 --> 01:23:14.790
don't have jobs
because immigrants

01:23:14.790 --> 01:23:15.870
have taken over the jobs?

01:23:15.870 --> 01:23:17.310
Have you ever spoken to anybody?

01:23:17.310 --> 01:23:19.880
I tried to look online, but
I couldn't find any fact

01:23:19.880 --> 01:23:22.242
where they could
explain that whatever

01:23:22.242 --> 01:23:23.700
tax money that
immigrants would pay

01:23:23.700 --> 01:23:26.520
would also go towards
the economy of America

01:23:26.520 --> 01:23:28.740
and not their own country.

01:23:28.740 --> 01:23:32.370
And I wondered if you have
anything online or any forums

01:23:32.370 --> 01:23:36.360
or any discussions to
people who actually think

01:23:36.360 --> 01:23:39.272
that that's the reason
why they are out of jobs

01:23:39.272 --> 01:23:41.228
or why there are
against immigrants?

01:23:47.970 --> 01:23:50.350
QUYEN DINH: Data
can be manipulated.

01:23:50.350 --> 01:23:53.380
So there's data from very
conservative think tanks saying

01:23:53.380 --> 01:23:55.900
that immigrants are
taking our jobs.

01:23:55.900 --> 01:23:58.120
There's also very
substantial data

01:23:58.120 --> 01:24:00.160
that says that is not the case.

01:24:00.160 --> 01:24:04.570
And I would take a
step back actually

01:24:04.570 --> 01:24:06.330
in thinking about this
Uber conversation.

01:24:06.330 --> 01:24:08.800
I would ask why
do you think that?

01:24:08.800 --> 01:24:11.620
Is this something that
you have experienced?

01:24:11.620 --> 01:24:14.260
Or is it something that
you've heard on the news?

01:24:14.260 --> 01:24:16.270
Because very often
times, I think

01:24:16.270 --> 01:24:20.830
it's hearing things on the news
through outlets that manipulate

01:24:20.830 --> 01:24:25.930
information and frame what is at
crisis in a very different way.

01:24:25.930 --> 01:24:27.760
Because I think
what is at crisis

01:24:27.760 --> 01:24:32.790
is that low income
communities need more jobs

01:24:32.790 --> 01:24:35.070
and that we as a
country have not

01:24:35.070 --> 01:24:39.420
been able to grow enough
infrastructure here

01:24:39.420 --> 01:24:43.710
for all Americans of all
socioeconomic ladders

01:24:43.710 --> 01:24:45.580
to have access to those jobs.

01:24:45.580 --> 01:24:48.240
So those coal miners
in Pennsylvania,

01:24:48.240 --> 01:24:50.820
is Donald Trump bringing
back the coal industry?

01:24:50.820 --> 01:24:53.820
I don't know how he's
going to do that.

01:24:53.820 --> 01:24:57.180
But that conversation is not
one, that honest conversation,

01:24:57.180 --> 01:24:58.980
is not one that's being had.

01:24:58.980 --> 01:25:01.740
And my interpretation
is, therefore,

01:25:01.740 --> 01:25:05.220
that they're manipulating
fears of Americans who

01:25:05.220 --> 01:25:08.280
want to make a living, who
want to make an honest earning,

01:25:08.280 --> 01:25:11.490
and be able to keep
their families together.

01:25:11.490 --> 01:25:14.010
And they are manipulating
that sense of fear

01:25:14.010 --> 01:25:15.870
and that sense of
scarcity instead

01:25:15.870 --> 01:25:17.784
of focusing on the
real question at hand,

01:25:17.784 --> 01:25:19.950
which is how are we going
to create new jobs for all

01:25:19.950 --> 01:25:20.850
of America?

01:25:20.850 --> 01:25:22.140
How are you going to do that?

01:25:22.140 --> 01:25:24.780
Show me through your policies,
not through your rhetoric,

01:25:24.780 --> 01:25:26.700
show me through your
policies how you're

01:25:26.700 --> 01:25:29.335
going to create this America?

01:25:29.335 --> 01:25:31.460
PHIL YU: You're also
operating under the assumption

01:25:31.460 --> 01:25:35.180
that a conversation like
that in the Uber car

01:25:35.180 --> 01:25:36.830
or whatever that
the person is going

01:25:36.830 --> 01:25:41.709
to be persuaded or dissuaded
by facts, by actual facts, when

01:25:41.709 --> 01:25:44.000
I know that a lot of the
times we're in that situation,

01:25:44.000 --> 01:25:46.340
it's like the person has
already made up their mind.

01:25:46.340 --> 01:25:50.215
They're not interested in
being persuaded with numbers.

01:25:53.000 --> 01:25:56.390
That's where you have to have
a more personal conversation

01:25:56.390 --> 01:25:59.890
than just I'm more
right than you.

01:25:59.890 --> 01:26:01.890
There's something more
to it than that you know.

01:26:01.890 --> 01:26:02.285
LORRIE MA: Great.

01:26:02.285 --> 01:26:02.810
Yeah.

01:26:02.810 --> 01:26:07.160
We have time for
one last question.

01:26:07.160 --> 01:26:08.930
AUDIENCE: So speaking
of people who

01:26:08.930 --> 01:26:11.810
have made up their mind
already about a lot of things,

01:26:11.810 --> 01:26:17.210
my parents immigrated here from
the Philippines 35 years ago.

01:26:17.210 --> 01:26:21.800
They are your prototypical
survivors here in the US.

01:26:21.800 --> 01:26:23.480
Made their way here.

01:26:23.480 --> 01:26:28.280
Raised me and my two
brothers to also be survivors

01:26:28.280 --> 01:26:32.300
and to excel and to kind of
make our way without kind

01:26:32.300 --> 01:26:35.720
of ruffling too many feathers.

01:26:35.720 --> 01:26:37.910
And it was only
after I came out here

01:26:37.910 --> 01:26:40.040
to California going
to college out here

01:26:40.040 --> 01:26:42.150
that I kind of
had my mind opened

01:26:42.150 --> 01:26:44.600
and to be exposed to what
being Asian American meant,

01:26:44.600 --> 01:26:49.880
and just kind of being accepting
of other cultures as well.

01:26:49.880 --> 01:26:52.520
But where I struggle is kind
of in having that conversation

01:26:52.520 --> 01:26:54.019
back with my parents,
with the older

01:26:54.019 --> 01:26:56.196
generation, the survivors.

01:26:56.196 --> 01:26:58.070
They have they seem to
have a little bit more

01:26:58.070 --> 01:27:01.340
of a mental block about these
issues because of the situation

01:27:01.340 --> 01:27:04.004
that they went through
many years ago.

01:27:04.004 --> 01:27:05.420
So do you have any
advice for kind

01:27:05.420 --> 01:27:09.010
of how to approach conversations
with the older generations?

01:27:09.010 --> 01:27:12.890
Because I think our age group
are more socially accepting.

01:27:12.890 --> 01:27:14.690
We are talking
about these issues,

01:27:14.690 --> 01:27:17.606
whereas my parents and
that generation are not.

01:27:25.100 --> 01:27:27.375
PHIL YU: For me, that's
another argument--

01:27:27.375 --> 01:27:29.750
it's not an argument, but
another conversation that's not

01:27:29.750 --> 01:27:30.700
going to be--

01:27:30.700 --> 01:27:32.630
no one's going to be
persuaded by being

01:27:32.630 --> 01:27:34.880
like I'm more right than
you, especially when you're

01:27:34.880 --> 01:27:37.087
dealing with your own parents.

01:27:37.087 --> 01:27:38.670
That needs to be
approached with love.

01:27:38.670 --> 01:27:43.560
And I think a lot of that
comes from sort of exhibiting

01:27:43.560 --> 01:27:47.754
and showing the way you live,
the relationship you have,

01:27:47.754 --> 01:27:49.670
the relationships that
you have and the things

01:27:49.670 --> 01:27:51.620
that you stand for.

01:27:51.620 --> 01:27:53.300
And then not just
like those crazy kids,

01:27:53.300 --> 01:27:56.170
but it's like this is I'm very
passionate about these things.

01:27:56.170 --> 01:27:58.610
I'm passionate about-- I
don't know what particularly

01:27:58.610 --> 01:28:01.340
what kind of attitudes
you're speaking to,

01:28:01.340 --> 01:28:06.050
but it does take sometimes
even the stodgiest, most

01:28:06.050 --> 01:28:09.200
like ingrained kind
of thinking can

01:28:09.200 --> 01:28:12.230
be persuaded by
people who live out

01:28:12.230 --> 01:28:16.160
and model a certain way of life,
even from those crazy kids.

01:28:16.160 --> 01:28:18.620
So I do think it
is something that

01:28:18.620 --> 01:28:23.120
needs to be approached
from showing an experience

01:28:23.120 --> 01:28:25.870
rather than being like
you're wrong mom or dad.

01:28:25.870 --> 01:28:26.870
You're out of your mind.

01:28:30.710 --> 01:28:36.800
That's me talking as a kid
and having those conversations

01:28:36.800 --> 01:28:39.640
where you're going to
run into some blocks.

01:28:42.500 --> 01:28:48.120
But I also think that it's OK
to take a breather from that

01:28:48.120 --> 01:28:49.862
and be like not so
frustrated, because I

01:28:49.862 --> 01:28:51.570
know a lot people who
are like my parents

01:28:51.570 --> 01:28:53.880
are driving me crazy.

01:28:53.880 --> 01:28:57.440
But it's also OK
to keep on trying

01:28:57.440 --> 01:28:59.040
it's a long game sometimes.

01:29:02.824 --> 01:29:05.160
QUYEN DINH: I was just going
to say that my dad still

01:29:05.160 --> 01:29:06.570
doesn't know what I do really.

01:29:06.570 --> 01:29:08.402
[LAUGHTER]

01:29:11.592 --> 01:29:13.550
If I were to tell him
I'm an engineer, ah yeah,

01:29:13.550 --> 01:29:15.230
it's awesome.

01:29:15.230 --> 01:29:16.740
Executive director, hmm.

01:29:16.740 --> 01:29:17.240
Policy?

01:29:17.240 --> 01:29:18.680
Hmm, weird.

01:29:22.080 --> 01:29:28.830
He is the apolitical
Republican actually,

01:29:28.830 --> 01:29:32.610
Republican by history
and experience

01:29:32.610 --> 01:29:34.890
as opposed to policy.

01:29:34.890 --> 01:29:37.600
And in my--

01:29:37.600 --> 01:29:40.680
I don't know-- like 15
years ish of work now,

01:29:40.680 --> 01:29:45.990
it's been really
moving to just have

01:29:45.990 --> 01:29:48.480
conversations with
him about why he

01:29:48.480 --> 01:29:50.550
thinks the way that he thinks.

01:29:50.550 --> 01:29:56.700
And moments of random
education kind of open up,

01:29:56.700 --> 01:30:00.690
and that's when I share with him
a little bit about the policy

01:30:00.690 --> 01:30:01.950
work that we do.

01:30:01.950 --> 01:30:04.260
And I do try to
make it personal.

01:30:04.260 --> 01:30:07.090
So when we talk about
deportation, for example,

01:30:07.090 --> 01:30:10.410
it's not an issue that folks
think that Asian American are

01:30:10.410 --> 01:30:11.880
impacted by.

01:30:11.880 --> 01:30:14.550
And for the Southeast
Asian American experience,

01:30:14.550 --> 01:30:16.500
it's even less known.

01:30:16.500 --> 01:30:19.890
And I shared with him, you know
when you think of my cousin--

01:30:19.890 --> 01:30:23.930
who my dad sponsored over
as like a 14-year-old--

01:30:23.930 --> 01:30:25.830
I said, do you remember
what his experience

01:30:25.830 --> 01:30:30.610
was like growing up without
parents really here in the US?

01:30:30.610 --> 01:30:31.616
He said, yeah.

01:30:31.616 --> 01:30:33.240
I felt really guilty
about it because I

01:30:33.240 --> 01:30:35.400
wish I had been able
to give him more.

01:30:35.400 --> 01:30:37.770
And I said you did
everything you could.

01:30:37.770 --> 01:30:39.300
But why weren't the
schools helping?

01:30:39.300 --> 01:30:41.049
Why weren't there any
resources or support

01:30:41.049 --> 01:30:42.720
there to prevent
him from getting

01:30:42.720 --> 01:30:45.120
into gangs in the first place?

01:30:45.120 --> 01:30:46.740
And I said that's
the reason why we

01:30:46.740 --> 01:30:49.680
do the work we do is to try
to fight for people like

01:30:49.680 --> 01:30:53.940
[INAUDIBLE] to say that no,
he needed support policies

01:30:53.940 --> 01:30:56.310
and programs that were there.

01:30:56.310 --> 01:30:59.940
And it was a light
switch moment for my dad.

01:30:59.940 --> 01:31:03.000
And so I see this as
an ongoing conversation

01:31:03.000 --> 01:31:05.910
and as an ongoing journey
for us to continue

01:31:05.910 --> 01:31:07.717
to get to know one another.

01:31:07.717 --> 01:31:09.300
And I look forward
to my conversations

01:31:09.300 --> 01:31:10.924
with him about the
Trump Administration

01:31:10.924 --> 01:31:13.770
and see what happens,
because I really

01:31:13.770 --> 01:31:17.520
do want to know what is on his
heart, and what is on his mind,

01:31:17.520 --> 01:31:19.530
and how he
understands the world,

01:31:19.530 --> 01:31:21.870
and how we can change our
understanding of the world

01:31:21.870 --> 01:31:22.976
together.

01:31:22.976 --> 01:31:23.850
LORRIE MA: All right.

01:31:23.850 --> 01:31:26.476
With that, I would like a round
of applause for our panelists.

01:31:26.476 --> 01:31:27.874
[APPLAUSE]

01:31:29.272 --> 01:31:32.540
And I'll have Frances come up.

01:31:32.540 --> 01:31:34.480
FRANCES: We have soup.

01:31:34.480 --> 01:31:36.220
Before you go, just
three quick things--

01:31:36.220 --> 01:31:37.720
I want to respect
your times, I know

01:31:37.720 --> 01:31:40.520
we're at 12:00-- so please
do give us feedback.

01:31:40.520 --> 01:31:43.420
The feedback link is going to
come up this screen shortly.

01:31:43.420 --> 01:31:46.990
Two, if this is your first
time engaging or participating

01:31:46.990 --> 01:31:48.670
or listening into
this conversation,

01:31:48.670 --> 01:31:50.560
we especially thank you.

01:31:50.560 --> 01:31:52.540
It takes some
boldness and courage

01:31:52.540 --> 01:31:53.920
to step into this space.

01:31:53.920 --> 01:31:55.510
We know it can be uncomfortable.

01:31:55.510 --> 01:31:56.800
And that's OK.

01:31:56.800 --> 01:32:00.010
It will always be
uncomfortable for a lot of us.

01:32:00.010 --> 01:32:01.770
So we thank you for being here.

01:32:01.770 --> 01:32:03.820
If you want to be more
involved, get in touch

01:32:03.820 --> 01:32:06.280
with your ERG leads.

01:32:06.280 --> 01:32:09.130
Sign up for a
race-announce for things

01:32:09.130 --> 01:32:12.100
that you can do after
the Decoding Race series.

01:32:12.100 --> 01:32:13.630
This is the ninth talk.

01:32:13.630 --> 01:32:15.830
All the previous
talks are on YouTube.

01:32:15.830 --> 01:32:18.800
This is going to be edited
and released on YouTube.

01:32:18.800 --> 01:32:21.580
So until then, we ask
you to just hold off

01:32:21.580 --> 01:32:23.770
on sharing anything
on social media.

01:32:23.770 --> 01:32:26.950
Lastly, let's all again thank
our panelists and Lorrie

01:32:26.950 --> 01:32:27.987
for moderating.

01:32:27.987 --> 01:32:28.820
Thank you, everyone.

01:32:28.820 --> 01:32:31.270
[APPLAUSE]
