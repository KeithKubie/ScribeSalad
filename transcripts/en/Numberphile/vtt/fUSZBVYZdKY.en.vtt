00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:02.080
JAMES GRIME: One, two, three,
test, test, test.

00:00:02.080 --> 00:00:03.640
BRADY HARAN: You know
that's not your--

00:00:03.640 --> 00:00:04.280
JAMES GRIME: OK.

00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:06.200
Hello everyone, how
are you doing?

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:08.890
OK, so today, we're not going to
do a number by itself, but

00:00:08.890 --> 00:00:11.960
a number that comes
with a friend--

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:19.390
220 and 284.

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:22.460
These are called amicable
numbers, or friendly numbers.

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:24.425
OK, so why are two
numbers friends?

00:00:24.425 --> 00:00:27.320
Well, we're going to look at the
divisors of these numbers.

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:30.114
So what divides 220?

00:00:30.114 --> 00:00:32.500
Well, 1 divides 220.

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:45.210
2, 4, 5, 10, 11, 20, 22, 44, 55,
110, and 220 itself, but

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:48.930
we don't include 220 itself,
not the number itself.

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:52.120
So we take these numbers here.

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:57.090
And if we add them up, we're
going to get 284.

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:02.830
But if we do the same thing
for 284, what divides 284?

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:08.310
1, 2, 4, 71 divides, and 142.

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:14.020
If we take those numbers and
add them up, we get 220.

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:18.680
So the divisors of 284 add up
to 220, and the divisors of

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:22.060
220 make 284.

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:23.290
So they come as a pair.

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:23.870
That's friendly.

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:25.520
For mathematicians,
that's friendly.

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:28.690
These aren't the only numbers,
but this is the smallest pair

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:30.090
of numbers that do this.

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:33.540
Now, these numbers were known in
ancient times, and in those

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:35.930
days, they liked to give
numbers properties.

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:40.350
And these numbers would
represent perfect harmony,

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:42.880
mutual friendship, and love.

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:48.630
So two lovers would inscribe
220 and 284 on talismans.

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:50.820
And you would wear one talisman,
and you would give

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:55.050
the other to your lover, a story
I like so much, I even

00:01:55.050 --> 00:02:01.030
had 220 and 284 inscribed
on talismans of my own.

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:02.150
BRADY HARAN: Why have you
got both of them?

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:04.320
Shouldn't your lover have
the other half?

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:05.560
JAMES GRIME: Yeah, thanks
for pointing that out.

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:06.820
Thanks for bringing that up.

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:09.539
I'm a 220 still looking
for my 284.

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:13.140
So these were known
in ancient times.

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:15.920
A few more were know
after that.

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:18.720
Actually, in the 17th century,
it was the 17th century

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:21.480
mathematicians who started to
look for some more of these.

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:25.400
But what I like about this is
that they missed a pair.

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:29.220
In fact, they missed the
second smallest pair of

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:29.870
amicable numbers.

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:34.620
And these were found 200 years
later in the 19th century by a

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:39.730
16-year-old Italian schoolboy
who found the second smallest

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:44.390
pair of amicable numbers, which
are about 1,184 and--

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:46.230
you can work the other
one out for yourself.

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:50.560
However, their best use is
probably their original one

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:55.440
when two lovers would inscribe
the numbers 220 and 284 to two

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:57.210
halves of a fruit.

00:02:57.210 --> 00:03:00.530
And then they would split the
fruit, and you take one half

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:03.730
for yourself, one half for your
lover, and by consuming

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:06.756
the fruit, you become
complete.

00:03:06.756 --> 00:03:08.950
BRADY HARAN: Awww!

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:09.962
That's lovely.

00:03:09.962 --> 00:03:12.120
I've got an apple out
here somewhere.

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:13.660
FEMALE SPEAKER: Oh, it's
got a hole in it.

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:14.150
BRADY HARAN: That'll do.

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:14.790
FEMALE SPEAKER: Is
that all right?

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:14.970
BRADY HARAN: Yep.

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:18.490
JAMES GRIME: Do the same thing
for 284, and you'll get 220.

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:19.670
BRADY HARAN: Don't cut
yourself, by the way.

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:20.692
JAMES GRIME: 220, can you see?

00:03:20.692 --> 00:03:22.400
BRADY HARAN: Oh,
yeah, sort of.

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:24.450
JAMES GRIME: 284.

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:27.950
220 and 284, just about.

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:30.650
Who am I going to give
the other half to?

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:35.150
[LAUGHTER]

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:36.350
BRADY HARAN: No one's
taking it.

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:40.680
[LAUGHTER]
