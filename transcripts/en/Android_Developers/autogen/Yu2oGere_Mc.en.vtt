that down and you know we realized that
we the lack of this objective industry

around the world now we started thinking

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:02.330
around the world now we started thinking
 

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:04.900
around the world now we started thinking
about this quite deeply and we have to

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:04.910
about this quite deeply and we have to
 

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:06.370
about this quite deeply and we have to
say this kind of something that kept us

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:06.380
say this kind of something that kept us
 

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:08.020

Udacity and General Assembly we realized

00:04:20.770 --> 00:04:20.780
Udacity and General Assembly we realized
 

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:23.590
Udacity and General Assembly we realized
that it was a real appetite for

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:23.600
that it was a real appetite for
 

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:25.690
that it was a real appetite for
learning app development that would

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:25.700
learning app development that would
 

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:29.170
learning app development that would
directly lead to jobs and so over the

00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:29.180
directly lead to jobs and so over the
 

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:31.210
directly lead to jobs and so over the
last few years we've done quite a bit to

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:31.220
last few years we've done quite a bit to
 

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:34.900
last few years we've done quite a bit to
close this gap and perhaps a lot of you

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:34.910
close this gap and perhaps a lot of you
 

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:36.160
close this gap and perhaps a lot of you
are already familiar with some of our

it's not really a knowledge test it's

00:11:50.769 --> 00:11:50.779
it's not really a knowledge test it's
 

00:11:50.779 --> 00:11:55.329
it's not really a knowledge test it's
really testing actual app development so

00:11:55.329 --> 00:11:55.339
really testing actual app development so
 

00:11:55.339 --> 00:11:57.609
really testing actual app development so
we thought about this and I think as

00:11:57.609 --> 00:11:57.619
we thought about this and I think as
 

00:11:57.619 --> 00:11:59.049
we thought about this and I think as
Peter was alluding to we thought about

00:11:59.049 --> 00:11:59.059
Peter was alluding to we thought about
 

00:11:59.059 --> 00:12:00.970
Peter was alluding to we thought about
the traditional concept of technical

00:12:00.970 --> 00:12:00.980
the traditional concept of technical
 

00:12:00.980 --> 00:12:02.980
the traditional concept of technical
certification for developers now in

00:12:02.980 --> 00:12:02.990
certification for developers now in
 

00:12:02.990 --> 00:12:03.939
certification for developers now in
other industries there may be

00:12:03.939 --> 00:12:03.949
other industries there may be
 

00:12:03.949 --> 00:12:05.769
other industries there may be
performance-based exams that work well

00:12:05.769 --> 00:12:05.779
performance-based exams that work well
 

00:12:05.779 --> 00:12:08.019
performance-based exams that work well
but specifically when we're looking at

00:12:08.019 --> 00:12:08.029
but specifically when we're looking at
 

00:12:08.029 --> 00:12:09.759
but specifically when we're looking at
technical certification perhaps app

00:12:09.759 --> 00:12:09.769
technical certification perhaps app
 

00:12:09.769 --> 00:12:11.829

developers it was it was something that

00:12:11.829 --> 00:12:11.839
developers it was it was something that
 

00:12:11.839 --> 00:12:14.319
developers it was it was something that
we really need to think about so we

00:12:14.319 --> 00:12:14.329
we really need to think about so we
 

00:12:14.329 --> 00:12:15.999
we really need to think about so we
thought first we need to make a job

00:12:15.999 --> 00:12:16.009
thought first we need to make a job
 

00:12:16.009 --> 00:12:18.309

focus as Peter alluded to when we say

00:12:18.309 --> 00:12:18.319
focus as Peter alluded to when we say
 

00:12:18.319 --> 00:12:19.900
focus as Peter alluded to when we say
job focus we mean that every

00:12:19.900 --> 00:12:19.910
job focus we mean that every
 

00:12:19.910 --> 00:12:21.280
job focus we mean that every
certification that we develop is

00:12:21.280 --> 00:12:21.290
certification that we develop is
 

00:12:21.290 --> 00:12:23.169
certification that we develop is
actually mapped to a job that's in the

job task analysis Peter also mentioned

00:12:28.900 --> 00:12:28.910
job task analysis Peter also mentioned
 

00:12:28.910 --> 00:12:31.299
job task analysis Peter also mentioned
performance based exams so we take an

00:12:31.299 --> 00:12:31.309
performance based exams so we take an
 

00:12:31.309 --> 00:12:33.939
performance based exams so we take an
exam that we will develop let's just

00:12:33.939 --> 00:12:33.949
exam that we will develop let's just
 

00:12:33.949 --> 00:12:35.679
exam that we will develop let's just
take one in that you'll be asked to

00:12:35.679 --> 00:12:35.689
take one in that you'll be asked to
 

00:12:35.689 --> 00:12:38.019
take one in that you'll be asked to
build extend add functionality to an

00:12:38.019 --> 00:12:38.029

existing app or correct determine and

00:12:40.660 --> 00:12:40.670
existing app or correct determine and
 

00:12:40.670 --> 00:12:43.480
existing app or correct determine and
correct defects in the code so we feel

00:12:43.480 --> 00:12:43.490
correct defects in the code so we feel
 

00:12:43.490 --> 00:12:44.769
correct defects in the code so we feel
that this is similar to the tasks that

00:12:44.769 --> 00:12:44.779
that this is similar to the tasks that
 

00:12:44.779 --> 00:12:46.210
that this is similar to the tasks that
developer would do in the real world for

00:12:46.210 --> 00:12:46.220
developer would do in the real world for
 

00:12:46.220 --> 00:12:48.699
developer would do in the real world for
an entry-level developer and as opposed

00:12:48.699 --> 00:12:48.709
an entry-level developer and as opposed
 

00:12:48.709 --> 00:12:50.829
an entry-level developer and as opposed
to a knowledge-based exam it's going to

00:12:50.829 --> 00:12:50.839
to a knowledge-based exam it's going to
 

00:12:50.839 --> 00:12:52.780
to a knowledge-based exam it's going to
evaluate the ability to perform tasks

00:12:52.780 --> 00:12:52.790
evaluate the ability to perform tasks
 

00:12:52.790 --> 00:12:55.119
evaluate the ability to perform tasks
can you do the tasks require the job not

00:12:55.119 --> 00:12:55.129

Android training that we we developed
over the last few years really what this

00:15:06.670 --> 00:15:06.680
over the last few years really what this
 

00:15:06.680 --> 00:15:09.429
over the last few years really what this
is about is more on the advanced side on

00:15:09.429 --> 00:15:09.439
is about is more on the advanced side on
 

00:15:09.439 --> 00:15:11.350
is about is more on the advanced side on
the intermediate to advanced side which

00:15:11.350 --> 00:15:11.360
the intermediate to advanced side which
 

00:15:11.360 --> 00:15:14.829
the intermediate to advanced side which
is based on if we zoom into let's say

00:15:14.829 --> 00:15:14.839
is based on if we zoom into let's say
 

00:15:14.839 --> 00:15:18.730
is based on if we zoom into let's say
