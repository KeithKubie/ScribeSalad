00:00:00.259 --> 00:00:02.442
- [Voiceover] So we've got
the expression two X plus four

00:00:02.442 --> 00:00:05.971
times five X minus nine
is equal to AX squared

00:00:05.971 --> 00:00:08.525
plus BX minus 36.

00:00:08.525 --> 00:00:10.429
And what we want to figure out is what are

00:00:10.429 --> 00:00:12.909
A and B going to be?

00:00:12.909 --> 00:00:14.139
And I encourage you to pause the video

00:00:14.139 --> 00:00:15.527
and try to figure it out.

00:00:16.206 --> 00:00:18.249
Well there's a coupe of
ways of trying to tackle it

00:00:18.249 --> 00:00:19.805
and the most straightforward would be

00:00:19.805 --> 00:00:21.639
just let's multiply these two binomials

00:00:21.639 --> 00:00:23.519
on the left-hand side
and let's see if we can

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:26.375
match up the terms and
match up the coefficients.

00:00:26.375 --> 00:00:28.140
So let's multiply this left-hand side.

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:30.788
There's a couple of ways to
think about tackling this.

00:00:30.788 --> 00:00:32.459
I like to think about it as applying

00:00:32.459 --> 00:00:34.317
the distributive property twice.

00:00:34.317 --> 00:00:36.476
So this expression on the left-hand side

00:00:36.476 --> 00:00:38.798
we can rewrite it, or one
way to think about it is

00:00:38.798 --> 00:00:41.399
we distribute the entire two X plus four

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:43.303
onto the five X minus nine.

00:00:43.303 --> 00:00:45.103
So this is the same
thing as two X plus four

00:00:45.103 --> 00:00:48.517
times five X, plus two X plus four

00:00:48.517 --> 00:00:51.698
times negative nine.

00:00:51.698 --> 00:00:52.997
Or we could write it like this.

00:00:52.997 --> 00:00:53.910
It is

00:00:55.215 --> 00:00:56.344
five X

00:00:57.277 --> 00:01:00.635
five X times two X plus four.

00:01:01.314 --> 00:01:03.705
Two X plus four.

00:01:03.705 --> 00:01:05.238
And then we could either view this as a

00:01:05.238 --> 00:01:07.833
plus negative nine or just a minus nine.

00:01:08.767 --> 00:01:11.089
Minus nine times, once again,

00:01:11.089 --> 00:01:12.459
two X plus four.

00:01:12.459 --> 00:01:14.734
Two X plus four.

00:01:14.734 --> 00:01:16.128
And all we've done is we've distributed

00:01:16.128 --> 00:01:19.146
this two X plus four onto
the five X minus nine.

00:01:19.146 --> 00:01:20.980
Well now when we write it like this,

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:23.186
when we look at the five X
times the two X plus four,

00:01:23.186 --> 00:01:25.369
we can distribute the five X.

00:01:25.369 --> 00:01:28.875
We can distribute the five
X onto the two X plus four.

00:01:28.875 --> 00:01:31.104
So what's five X times two X?

00:01:31.104 --> 00:01:34.378
Well that's going to be 10 X squared,

00:01:34.378 --> 00:01:38.395
five X times four is plus 20 X.

00:01:38.395 --> 00:01:40.298
Plus 20 X.

00:01:40.298 --> 00:01:42.597
And then we have,

00:01:42.597 --> 00:01:45.477
and then we have negative nine

00:01:45.477 --> 00:01:49.245
times two X is going to be negative 18 X.

00:01:49.971 --> 00:01:51.897
Negative 18 X.

00:01:51.897 --> 00:01:55.543
And then you have negative nine times four

00:01:55.543 --> 00:01:58.353
is negative 36.

00:01:58.353 --> 00:02:00.234
And now we can simplify this a little bit.

00:02:00.234 --> 00:02:01.859
We have two first degree terms.

00:02:01.859 --> 00:02:04.297
So let's see, we have 10 X squared,

00:02:04.297 --> 00:02:06.016
10 X squared,

00:02:06.016 --> 00:02:08.476
and then these two first degree terms,

00:02:08.476 --> 00:02:09.846
let me circle them.

00:02:09.846 --> 00:02:11.983
So we have these two first degree terms.

00:02:11.983 --> 00:02:14.792
If I have 20 Xs and i were
to take away 18 of those

00:02:14.792 --> 00:02:17.138
Xs I'm going to have two X left over.

00:02:17.138 --> 00:02:19.715
20 minus 18, two X.

00:02:19.715 --> 00:02:21.549
And then of course we still have the

00:02:21.549 --> 00:02:22.803
minus 36.

00:02:22.803 --> 00:02:24.289
Now all I've been doing so far is

00:02:24.289 --> 00:02:27.888
simplifying or rewriting
the left-hand side.

00:02:27.888 --> 00:02:29.142
We have to remember, this was an equation

00:02:29.142 --> 00:02:31.975
so this needs to be equal
to the right-hand side.

00:02:31.975 --> 00:02:35.345
So this is going to be
equal to AX squared.

00:02:36.108 --> 00:02:39.227
So AX squared

00:02:40.115 --> 00:02:42.143
plus BX,

00:02:42.143 --> 00:02:45.525
plus BX minus 36.

00:02:45.525 --> 00:02:46.779
Minus 36.

00:02:46.779 --> 00:02:47.963
And now that I've wrote it

00:02:47.963 --> 00:02:50.401
a little color-coded it
might jump out at you

00:02:50.401 --> 00:02:52.537
what A and B are going to be.

00:02:52.537 --> 00:02:55.974
We have 10 X squared over here

00:02:55.974 --> 00:02:57.971
and then the second degree
term on the right-hand side

00:02:57.971 --> 00:02:59.502
is AX squared.

00:02:59.502 --> 00:03:02.126
So 10 must be equal to A,

00:03:02.126 --> 00:03:03.915
or these two coefficients must be equal.

00:03:03.915 --> 00:03:06.306
So we could write A is equal to 10.

00:03:06.306 --> 00:03:09.000
And then when we look at
the first degree term,

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.251
we have two X here and we
have BX right over here.

00:03:12.251 --> 00:03:14.921
And so two must be equal to B,

00:03:14.921 --> 00:03:17.359
or B must be equal to two.

00:03:17.359 --> 00:03:20.006
And it all worked out
that our constant terms

00:03:20.006 --> 00:03:22.235
are the same on both sides.

00:03:22.235 --> 00:03:25.044
So there we have it, A
equals 10, B equals two.

00:03:25.044 --> 00:03:26.507
Now once you're practiced at this

00:03:26.507 --> 00:03:28.516
you might be able to
say well how can I get

00:03:28.516 --> 00:03:29.989
a faster way to do this?

00:03:29.989 --> 00:03:31.628
Although it might be a
little bit more prone

00:03:31.628 --> 00:03:33.484
to careless mistakes.

00:03:33.484 --> 00:03:35.134
Is you could say well how can I get,

00:03:35.134 --> 00:03:37.176
how do I get an X squared?

00:03:37.176 --> 00:03:39.498
How do I, when I multiply
these things out,

00:03:39.498 --> 00:03:40.358
how do I get an X squared?

00:03:40.358 --> 00:03:41.960
Well the only way that
I can get an X squared

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:45.606
is when I multiply the
two X times the five X.

00:03:45.606 --> 00:03:47.940
And that's going to be 10 X squared.

00:03:48.828 --> 00:03:49.895
And then you could say, alright,

00:03:49.895 --> 00:03:51.893
A is going to be equal to 10.

00:03:51.893 --> 00:03:54.029
And then you could say
how could I get an X?

00:03:54.029 --> 00:03:56.003
Well there's two ways that you can get,

00:03:56.003 --> 00:03:57.674
two ways to get an X.

00:03:57.674 --> 00:04:01.040
You could multiply two X times

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:02.713
negative nine.

00:04:02.713 --> 00:04:05.707
So that would be negative 18 X.

00:04:05.707 --> 00:04:08.795
Or you could multiply four times five X,

00:04:08.795 --> 00:04:11.698
which is going to be plus 20 X.

00:04:11.698 --> 00:04:13.928
If you add these two
together you're going to get,

00:04:13.928 --> 00:04:16.389
they're going to be equal to two X.

00:04:16.389 --> 00:04:18.131
So two.

00:04:18.131 --> 00:04:22.658
Two X, BX, B must be equal to two.

00:04:22.658 --> 00:04:23.865
And then you can just check,

00:04:23.865 --> 00:04:25.050
well how am I gonna get a constant term?

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:26.907
Well I have to multiply
these two constant terms.

00:04:26.907 --> 00:04:29.531
Four times negative nine,
you're gonna get negative 36.

00:04:29.531 --> 00:04:30.993
So the second way I just did it will be

00:04:30.993 --> 00:04:32.132
a little bit faster, you're a little bit

00:04:32.132 --> 00:04:34.198
more prone to making careless mistakes,

00:04:34.198 --> 00:04:35.243
but hopefully you appreciate that,

00:04:35.243 --> 00:04:37.356
I'm really just doing the same thing.

00:04:37.356 --> 00:04:40.300
Maybe with different levels of clarity.
