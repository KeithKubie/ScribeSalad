00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.270
 

00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:01.709
Yeah, don't make me--

00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:03.707
you can blackmail me later
with the outtakes.

00:00:03.707 --> 00:00:06.490
 

00:00:06.490 --> 00:00:10.130
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:13.650
The human genome contains 23
pairs of chromosomes, plus the

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:14.780
mitochondrial DNA.

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:17.770
And throughout this series,
we'll be featuring a new video

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:21.498
every day, looking at each
of these, one by one.

00:00:21.498 --> 00:00:25.490
[BIRD CHIRPING]

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:28.910
A great man once said, you
cannot escape your destiny.

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:31.420
 

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:34.680
These animals, which really do
look quite different from us,

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:37.830
physically, are, at the
genetic level, almost

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:39.080
indistinguishable.

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:51.154
 

00:00:51.154 --> 00:00:51.645
Great.

00:00:51.645 --> 00:00:54.380
[LAUGHTER]

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:57.456
You could say that this
is the secret of life.

00:00:57.456 --> 00:01:01.320
 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:02.740
It's just amazing,
really, isn't it?

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:20.960
 

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:24.510
Well, maybe it's not your
grandma, your grandpa.

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:25.824
[LAUGHING]

00:01:25.824 --> 00:01:27.380
Oh!

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:28.630
You just--

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:37.639
