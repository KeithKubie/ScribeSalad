 Slavery.</i>

 that it's now trendy</i>

 Robin Thede and I traveled</i>

 in Kentucky</i>

00:00:22.721 --> 00:00:24.891

 with owner Colleen Sutton</i>

00:00:24.924 --> 00:00:27.293

 of planning our own wedding.</i>

00:00:27.326 --> 00:00:28.895
-Great place.
-It's so beautiful here.

-He had slaves, right?
-He did.

00:00:46.445 --> 00:00:48.915
There were three slaves
that were recorded.

00:00:48.948 --> 00:00:50.450
But it was recorded earlier

00:00:50.483 --> 00:00:53.286
-that he did actually have
four slaves, -Four slaves.

00:00:53.319 --> 00:00:55.455
-and, um...
-What happened to the other one?

00:00:55.488 --> 00:00:57.557
He... did... f...

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:59.525

<i>and surprisingly, I didn't feel
 the urge to run away.</i>

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:13.506
So, you want to know what
one of the most ironic things

00:01:13.539 --> 00:01:15.508
about where
we're standing right now?

00:01:15.541 --> 00:01:17.410
-That we're not working?
-(Sutton laughs)

00:01:17.443 --> 00:01:19.445
Is look how close we are
to the river.

00:01:19.478 --> 00:01:21.247
Kentucky was a slave state.

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:23.883
That's Indiana--
and that was a free state.

00:01:23.916 --> 00:01:26.018
Wait a minute, wait a minute,
wait a minute, wait a minute.

00:01:26.051 --> 00:01:28.488
-You had a slave living
right here... -Yes, sir.

00:01:28.521 --> 00:01:30.957
-staring at freedom every day.
-Yes. Absolutely.

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:32.959
-Wow. -That's how committed
black people are

00:01:32.992 --> 00:01:35.661
to not swimming, is that
we would rather stay slaves

00:01:35.694 --> 00:01:38.297
-than swim 50 yards to freedom.
-That is... Well, you know.

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:40.733

 didn't see anything suspicious</i>

00:01:42.001 --> 00:01:43.603
Hey, Colleen, what's that?

00:01:43.636 --> 00:01:46.172
YARD: It looks like a place
to hang black people.

00:01:46.205 --> 00:01:48.908
Uh, no. Actually, I think
it was more of a pulley system,

00:01:48.941 --> 00:01:50.776
where they were able
to bring heavy objects

00:01:50.809 --> 00:01:53.212
from down low up to
the third floor of the mansion.

00:01:53.245 --> 00:01:54.881
-Oh, like black people?
-Oh, I love that.

00:01:54.914 --> 00:01:56.315
No, not like black people.

00:01:56.348 --> 00:01:58.251
How authentic
can these weddings get?

00:01:58.284 --> 00:02:00.620
Right? So if we want to have
a plantation wedding,

00:02:00.653 --> 00:02:02.221
I mean,
how authentic can they get?

00:02:02.254 --> 00:02:04.957
Do we dress in costume?
Like, what can go on?

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:07.226
You can really do
anything that you want.

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:09.962
You can be as elaborate
and do something

00:02:09.995 --> 00:02:12.198
like a traditional
plantation wedding...

00:02:12.231 --> 00:02:14.534
Traditional...

00:02:14.567 --> 00:02:17.737
1790... traditional?

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:19.972
-Absolutely.
-Because we're gonna dress up

00:02:20.005 --> 00:02:22.375
our little cousins, like,
you know, little slaves,

00:02:22.408 --> 00:02:24.477
-little... little (bleep)
running around. -Yeah.

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:25.912
-You know what I mean?
-Aw...

00:02:25.945 --> 00:02:27.213
And we might beat 'em.

00:02:27.246 --> 00:02:28.915
-With, like, Nerf whips.
-Everybody take turns.

00:02:28.948 --> 00:02:31.417
-Not real whips.
-Yeah, not real whips.

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:34.520
Yeah, that doesn't...
that doesn't feel good to me.

00:02:34.553 --> 00:02:35.988
If we have our wedding here,

00:02:36.021 --> 00:02:38.090
and let's say she gets pregnant
wedding night--

00:02:38.123 --> 00:02:39.759
-'cause it's gonna be on--
-Yeah.

00:02:39.792 --> 00:02:43.563
-um, do you keep the baby,
or...? -(laughing)

00:02:43.596 --> 00:02:44.764
What do we do?

00:02:44.797 --> 00:02:46.465
-No. -Is it ours?
Can we leave with it?

00:02:46.498 --> 00:02:47.900
Absolutely. Yes.

00:02:47.933 --> 00:02:49.902
I'm... I am the owner
of the property,

00:02:49.935 --> 00:02:52.805
-I am not the owner of you.
-Of us. Yeah.

00:02:52.838 --> 00:02:55.274
Oh. Well,
that should be on the sign.

00:02:55.307 --> 00:02:57.944
<i> Our approach might have been
 too traditional for Colleen,</i>

00:02:57.977 --> 00:03:00.179
<i> so we sat down
 with a black person</i>

00:03:00.212 --> 00:03:01.747
<i> to see how they would feel.</i>

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:04.817
Cuita, you actually catered
weddings at this plantation.

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:06.819 line:0%
-Yes.
-How do you feel about that,

00:03:06.852 --> 00:03:08.487 line:0%
having a wedding
on a plantation?

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:10.790 line:0%
I actually don't see
an issue with it.

00:03:10.823 --> 00:03:13.492
So if you had a contract
that said that...

00:03:13.525 --> 00:03:15.661
we want
an all-African American staff

00:03:15.694 --> 00:03:17.496

the N-word...

-in the spirit...

-but you get paid...
-$10,000 for the day.

00:03:21.467 --> 00:03:24.303
Right. And it's just in the
spirit of the antebellum world.

00:03:24.336 --> 00:03:25.938
-No.
-THEDE: No.

00:03:25.971 --> 00:03:29.208
-No money's gonna allow...
-$20,000 a day. $20,000.

-I don't think I could put
a price... -$35,000.

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:33.446
-I wouldn't put a price on it.
-$50,000.

00:03:33.479 --> 00:03:36.415
-No. -A million dollars.
-A hundred thousand dollars.

00:03:36.448 --> 00:03:38.417
-A million dollars.
-That's a lot of money.

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:41.254
They could probably call me
(bleep) for... a million!

00:03:41.287 --> 00:03:42.555
(laughs)

00:03:42.588 --> 00:03:44.724
Now, a lot of people think
it's bad to get married

00:03:44.757 --> 00:03:46.525
at a plantation,
given its history.

00:03:46.558 --> 00:03:48.027
Do you think that's valid?

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:49.795
I think there is validity there,

00:03:49.828 --> 00:03:53.232
but I think that if we were to
look at our nation as a whole,

00:03:53.265 --> 00:03:56.302
there are so many places
that evil has happened

00:03:56.335 --> 00:04:00.339
that we wouldn't have anywhere
to do incredible events.

 happens everywhere,</i>

00:04:02.541 --> 00:04:04.510
