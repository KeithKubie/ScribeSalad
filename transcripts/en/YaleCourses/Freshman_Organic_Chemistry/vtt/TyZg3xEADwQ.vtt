1
00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:06.270
Okay.
As you may remember,
way back before the uh,
exam,

2
00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:09.420
we'd started looking at how things really happened,

3
00:00:09.421 --> 00:00:13.650
how people were able to figure out about bonds and how atoms were arranged and

4
00:00:13.651 --> 00:00:16.350
molecules reacted before.

5
00:00:16.351 --> 00:00:21.351
There were the powerful techniques that we developed mostly in the last 25 or 30

6
00:00:22.411 --> 00:00:26.850
years as far as their practical application in organic chemistry.

7
00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:30.060
But how they found these out before that time,

8
00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:33.870
and it started with what we call the chemical revolution,

9
00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:38.960
which was launched by Lavoie ca with this book in 1789 the same year as the

10
00:00:39.781 --> 00:00:44.280
French revolution,
the elementary treatise of chemistry,
which you remember,

11
00:00:44.281 --> 00:00:49.281
he started work on just because he was interested in improving nomenclature,

12
00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:54.150
but found that there was a such a tight coupling between nomenclature and the

13
00:00:54.151 --> 00:00:59.151
science that that is the fact and the theory that he couldn't improve any one of

14
00:00:59.551 --> 00:01:03.480
them without improving the others.
So we saw last time that,

15
00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:06.970
that he,
uh,
that he developed a,

16
00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:10.560
that in the process of developing a new nomenclature,

17
00:01:10.561 --> 00:01:15.030
he also developed instruments so that he could weigh gasses because weighing

18
00:01:15.031 --> 00:01:19.710
turns out to be such an important feature in all of 19th century chemistry,

19
00:01:19.711 --> 00:01:22.770
no doubt the most important single technique.

20
00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:27.450
But he also could measure heat,
which didn't have any weight for that.

21
00:01:27.451 --> 00:01:32.340
He developed a calorimeter together with Laplas and we saw how that worked by,

22
00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:33.960
by melting ice.

23
00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:39.570
So now we're going to look at some of the other developments from this book in

24
00:01:39.571 --> 00:01:40.201
particular,

25
00:01:40.201 --> 00:01:45.201
the idea of oxidation by know that there's no doubt that the most important

26
00:01:46.861 --> 00:01:51.630
element for Lavoie Oza was oxygen because of its key role in his chemistry,

27
00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:56.910
so that all other elements were called bases or radicals,

28
00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:01.020
right.
And they could react with oxygen to become new things.

29
00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:05.730
There were several degrees of oxidation as shown in this table from the English

30
00:02:05.731 --> 00:02:07.080
translation of his book.

31
00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:12.600
So first you'd get an oxide oxides of all the elements that are listed in the

32
00:02:12.601 --> 00:02:15.960
first table.
For example,
a hydrogen,

33
00:02:15.961 --> 00:02:19.170
when oxidized would give water.
That's the second row.

34
00:02:19.171 --> 00:02:21.090
But the first row is caloric.

35
00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:25.530
This was sort of a stretch at least it seems so from our perspective that

36
00:02:25.531 --> 00:02:30.030
caloric heat,
when it gets oxidized yields oxygen,
gas.

37
00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:34.700
But then there were further degrees of oxidation if you reacted,
uh,

38
00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:36.240
with more oxygen.

39
00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:40.560
So there was second degree of oxidation according to his theory was to give an

40
00:02:40.561 --> 00:02:44.880
acid that he,
that the suffix was to be systematically,

41
00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:45.870
oh u.

42
00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:51.230
So us and those names we use now like cupressus ferrous come directly from this

43
00:02:52.081 --> 00:02:53.440
work of Lavoie Zaa.

44
00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:58.620
So that's the lower oxidation state of an acid,
right?

45
00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:03.370
So you have for example,
nitrous acid,
carbonic acid,
sulfuric acid,

46
00:03:03.371 --> 00:03:08.110
phos for us acid,
he said,
and then you have a still higher degree of oxidation.

47
00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:12.160
The third degree,
which is the [inaudible] acid.
So you have nitric acid,

48
00:03:12.161 --> 00:03:14.440
carbonic acid,
sulfuric acid,

49
00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:19.600
and notice that many of these were not known and many of them still are not

50
00:03:19.601 --> 00:03:24.430
known because the theory wasn't exactly right.
For example,
carbon carbon,

51
00:03:24.431 --> 00:03:26.950
us acid was not known at that time.

52
00:03:26.951 --> 00:03:31.270
You see in the second entry in the second row,
second column.

53
00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:35.410
Okay.
And then there was still a fourth degree of oxidation,

54
00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:38.080
which he called the oxygenated Eric acid.

55
00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:43.030
He didn't use the per oxy acid as we would often use nowadays,

56
00:03:43.031 --> 00:03:47.050
but he used,
for example,
oxygenated nitric acid,
which was unknown.

57
00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:49.770
Oxygenated carbonic acid was unknown.

58
00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:54.790
Same for sulfuric or phosphoric and oxidated oxygenated muriatic acid was diff.

59
00:03:56.891 --> 00:04:00.520
Logistic used to be called [inaudible] logistics,
hated marine acid,

60
00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:04.300
but he has a more systematic name showing its degree of oxidation.

61
00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:09.070
So these us and it Canadians that we still use come directly from Lavoie Z.

62
00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:14.500
Uh,
and probably the,
uh,

63
00:04:14.501 --> 00:04:17.120
the next most important,
uh,

64
00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:21.400
a tool he developed was one for doing elemental analysis.
You remember,

65
00:04:21.401 --> 00:04:23.200
you could do proximate analysis,

66
00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:27.310
what other compounds are present in the substance you're studying?

67
00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:32.540
Or You could do ultimate analysis and find out how much of the elements.
Uh,

68
00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:33.401
there was an each,

69
00:04:33.401 --> 00:04:38.080
and this was how to do elemental analysis of an organic oil.

70
00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:42.490
So it has carbon,
hydrogen,
oxygen in it.
Okay.

71
00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:47.700
So this big a upside down barrel inside another barrel with water in it is how

72
00:04:47.921 --> 00:04:52.921
he got air for the burning because the upside down a barrel would be lowered

73
00:04:53.261 --> 00:04:54.041
into the water,

74
00:04:54.041 --> 00:04:58.300
which would create pressure and the oxygen that's trapped inside it would then

75
00:04:58.301 --> 00:05:03.301
flow out through the pipe you see coming from the tank through a dryer and and

76
00:05:04.961 --> 00:05:06.490
into this big,
uh,

77
00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:11.590
big vertical cylinder where the combustion takes place fed by a,

78
00:05:11.591 --> 00:05:16.360
an oil supply,
which,
which,
uh,
is siphoned in as,
as needed.

79
00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:17.530
Uh,

80
00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:22.530
so there's a lamp inside burning the oil with the air and the vapors generated

81
00:05:23.321 --> 00:05:28.090
by the combustion come up and out the tube to the right.
So there's the lamp,

82
00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:33.480
the gas has come out and water gets condensed in the spiral tube in here and

83
00:05:33.671 --> 00:05:36.430
drips down and gets collected in the jar that you see.

84
00:05:36.850 --> 00:05:41.380
And the part that doesn't condense and get collected into the jar gets absorbed

85
00:05:41.381 --> 00:05:45.760
in that horizontal tube that has calcium chloride drying agent in it.

86
00:05:45.761 --> 00:05:46.750
So at the end of the,

87
00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:51.490
of the experiment you weigh how much water there is in the jar and how much the

88
00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:56.230
calcium chloride is increased in weight and that tells you how much water there

89
00:05:56.231 --> 00:05:59.930
was.
And what does that tell you about the compound?
How much,
what,

90
00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:06.600
what element is being measured in the oil by May,

91
00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:09.260
my way in the water it's measuring the hydrogen,

92
00:06:09.530 --> 00:06:14.030
so he had to know what percent by weight,
water is of hydrogen.

93
00:06:14.570 --> 00:06:17.180
Then if he measured the water that came from combustion,

94
00:06:17.181 --> 00:06:20.810
he measured how much hydrogen there was in the oil sample that was being burned.

95
00:06:21.470 --> 00:06:26.240
And then the,
the gas is continued to go through lime,
water,

96
00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:28.580
calcium hydroxide,

97
00:06:28.581 --> 00:06:33.350
so that would absorb a CO2 as calcium carbonate.

98
00:06:34.770 --> 00:06:38.240
So those would include increase in mass and he had two of them.

99
00:06:38.241 --> 00:06:41.570
So whatever got through the first one would hopefully be collected in the next

100
00:06:41.571 --> 00:06:45.800
one.
And then there's another drawing tube on further from that because these

101
00:06:45.801 --> 00:06:48.500
solutions,
as you pass gas over them,

102
00:06:48.830 --> 00:06:51.050
they lose a little bit of their water right.

103
00:06:51.051 --> 00:06:54.650
So they'd be losing weight as well as gaining weight from the CEO to that's

104
00:06:54.651 --> 00:06:57.170
being absorbed,
right.
But the law,

105
00:06:57.200 --> 00:07:00.770
but that water that's lost is reabsorbed in that final tube.

106
00:07:01.010 --> 00:07:03.170
So you weigh in at the end and now you have,

107
00:07:03.200 --> 00:07:06.680
you've corrected for whatever loss of water there was from the bulbs.

108
00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:11.750
And now you know what weight of CO2 and if you know what fraction of Co two is

109
00:07:11.751 --> 00:07:15.740
carbon and there's a homework problem for Friday that you can look at.

110
00:07:15.740 --> 00:07:20.000
You can work in groups on that.
Uh,
that shows you how he knew how much,
uh,

111
00:07:20.650 --> 00:07:25.260
what weight percentage of CO2 was carbon.
So having that measured,
how much,

112
00:07:25.550 --> 00:07:28.000
how much co two.
He knew how much carbon there was the oil.

113
00:07:28.250 --> 00:07:30.740
So we measured the hydrogen,
he measured the carbon.

114
00:07:30.741 --> 00:07:32.810
So that's fine if it's a hydrocarbon oil.

115
00:07:33.020 --> 00:07:36.650
How about if there was oxygen in the oil notice?

116
00:07:36.651 --> 00:07:39.080
He's adding all kinds of oxygen from the air.

117
00:07:39.740 --> 00:07:42.020
So how's he going to know how much oxygen there was?

118
00:07:42.021 --> 00:07:44.360
If it was an alcohol or something that he was burning?

119
00:07:46.460 --> 00:07:49.130
<v 1>Sam
can't hear you.</v>

120
00:07:50.810 --> 00:07:55.460
<v 0>It's the leftovers.
You see how much oil got burned,
how much carbon,</v>

121
00:07:55.461 --> 00:07:59.240
how much hydrogen.
And you assume there's nothing else there except oxygen.

122
00:07:59.241 --> 00:08:03.680
So you get oxygen by difference and that's the way oxygen is almost always

123
00:08:03.681 --> 00:08:05.270
measured is by difference,

124
00:08:05.810 --> 00:08:06.530
<v 1>right?</v>

125
00:08:06.530 --> 00:08:09.350
<v 0>So you assume and you have to be sure there are no other elements there.</v>

126
00:08:09.351 --> 00:08:11.930
If you want that to be true,
obviously.
Okay.

127
00:08:11.931 --> 00:08:14.330
So this was a big operation and it took,
you know,

128
00:08:14.480 --> 00:08:17.600
somebody to control the air supply to make sure it was constant.

129
00:08:17.720 --> 00:08:22.220
Notice incidentally,
there's a tea here.
So there was another one of these things,

130
00:08:22.221 --> 00:08:25.940
but over here and another one of these double barrels,
right?
Why?

131
00:08:28.520 --> 00:08:31.760
Ah,
so when you,
when you run out of air in one,

132
00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:34.430
you switch to the valve and take it from the other one,

133
00:08:34.431 --> 00:08:37.640
then you can go back to the first one.
So you have an infinite supply of air,

134
00:08:37.760 --> 00:08:39.620
plenty to burn the oil,
right?

135
00:08:39.621 --> 00:08:43.010
But you need someone to control that and you need someone else to make sure the

136
00:08:43.011 --> 00:08:44.030
lamp stays lit,

137
00:08:44.031 --> 00:08:48.320
that it gets the proper amount of oil siphoned in and the air flow is right.

138
00:08:48.660 --> 00:08:51.170
You need someone else in the COO to collectors,

139
00:08:51.171 --> 00:08:54.290
you just blow gas over the surface.
Right?

140
00:08:54.410 --> 00:08:57.550
So it's got little key on the top and a hook that goes down in somebody.

141
00:08:57.630 --> 00:09:01.020
Somebody has to be standing there doing this to keep it stirred.
Right.

142
00:09:01.021 --> 00:09:04.890
So that's true.
So it takes at least three or four people to run this thing.

143
00:09:05.190 --> 00:09:09.720
Right.
And it costs a lot of money to build.
So no one else built one.
In fact,

144
00:09:10.020 --> 00:09:14.970
it's not absolutely certain that Lavoie z a ever used this,
although it exists.

145
00:09:15.210 --> 00:09:15.481
Right.

146
00:09:15.481 --> 00:09:19.290
Because he was busy with other things having to do with the French revolution by

147
00:09:19.291 --> 00:09:23.230
the time this came along.
But this was big science.
Right.

148
00:09:23.231 --> 00:09:26.340
And he was very wealthy,
so he was able to do this kind of thing.

149
00:09:27.150 --> 00:09:31.260
But he showed in this diagram exactly how it could be done.
So it was no secret,

150
00:09:31.261 --> 00:09:35.760
not like the,
not like what the alchemists did was our questionnaire.

151
00:09:36.620 --> 00:09:40.750
<v 1>No.
Yeah,
they did.</v>

152
00:09:40.790 --> 00:09:43.590
They may measure the amount of air that into it.

153
00:09:44.290 --> 00:09:47.140
<v 0>Uh,
no.
Like I don't think so because there wasn't any purpose.</v>

154
00:09:47.141 --> 00:09:50.320
You didn't care how much air you put in because all,

155
00:09:50.350 --> 00:09:54.310
most of the air just flowed right on through.
It was never collected,
right?

156
00:09:54.311 --> 00:09:58.030
It just carried the other gasses along where the water and the co two would be

157
00:09:58.031 --> 00:09:59.590
collected.
What it is

158
00:09:59.840 --> 00:10:03.110
<v 1>you,
the
content of the air.</v>

159
00:10:03.920 --> 00:10:05.250
Like they could just measure

160
00:10:05.290 --> 00:10:08.980
<v 0>how much oxygen to get the oxygen conceivably,
but that was never done.</v>

161
00:10:08.981 --> 00:10:11.620
It would've been very difficult to collect all that air and measure it

162
00:10:11.621 --> 00:10:14.440
accurately.
Okay.

163
00:10:14.620 --> 00:10:17.740
Now what if you have a substance that won't burn cleanly?

164
00:10:17.741 --> 00:10:19.390
So you can't measure these gasses.

165
00:10:19.391 --> 00:10:24.391
Notice incidentally the role of gases and understand things in it because they

166
00:10:24.431 --> 00:10:26.800
provide easy separation,
right?

167
00:10:26.801 --> 00:10:31.060
And then since he was able to weigh gas once,

168
00:10:31.630 --> 00:10:33.550
then he knows the gas density.

169
00:10:33.760 --> 00:10:38.110
So now all you have to do from then on in principle is measure the volume of
gas.

170
00:10:38.470 --> 00:10:40.060
And you know how much stuff there was.

171
00:10:40.061 --> 00:10:42.850
So gas has played a really key role through all this,

172
00:10:43.120 --> 00:10:45.040
but suppose you had a substance that wouldn't burn,

173
00:10:45.041 --> 00:10:49.360
that you couldn't convert to steam and Co two what do you do then?

174
00:10:49.600 --> 00:10:51.430
For example,
grape sugar.

175
00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:56.490
So here's chapter 13 where he talks about the lawsuit,
the Hiza,

176
00:10:56.910 --> 00:11:00.790
the grape sugar,
which will,
which will char,
it won't burn cleanly.

177
00:11:00.820 --> 00:11:04.330
So what do you do well is he says up at the top there to the mall affect come

178
00:11:04.331 --> 00:11:09.310
also fellow VA,
everyone knows how to make wine,
cider and mead,

179
00:11:09.910 --> 00:11:12.520
right?
So can you see what he's gonna do?

180
00:11:15.470 --> 00:11:18.920
So here's the device for that one,
which is in many ways sort of similar,

181
00:11:18.921 --> 00:11:19.760
but you don't need an air.

182
00:11:19.761 --> 00:11:24.380
So you don't put the area in what you have as a big a flask at the beginning,

183
00:11:24.381 --> 00:11:27.470
which has sugar,
yeast and water,
right?

184
00:11:27.830 --> 00:11:32.830
So the yeast ferments the sugar and changes it into,

185
00:11:33.080 --> 00:11:37.160
uh,
into co two.
So you have it foams up.

186
00:11:37.161 --> 00:11:38.780
If you've ever seen something for many,

187
00:11:38.781 --> 00:11:41.480
they say you have to have something that catches the foam so it won't get into

188
00:11:41.481 --> 00:11:45.620
your device.
And then you have something that will absorb water.

189
00:11:45.800 --> 00:11:48.740
Now the water is not just,
it's not like the previous one where,

190
00:11:48.741 --> 00:11:50.640
where the water is all formed by thing.

191
00:11:50.650 --> 00:11:53.000
Cause you've got a whole bunch of water there at the beginning.
Right?

192
00:11:53.320 --> 00:11:54.730
So that's not what you're trying to measure.

193
00:11:54.731 --> 00:11:56.500
What you're trying to measure is how much carbon,

194
00:11:56.501 --> 00:11:58.990
how much co two there is in the grape sugar.

195
00:11:59.320 --> 00:12:02.890
So you have these sodium sodium hydroxide solutions,

196
00:12:02.891 --> 00:12:05.020
the base that will absorb the co two as,

197
00:12:05.080 --> 00:12:09.490
as carbonates are you weigh those before and after.
And the excess gas,

198
00:12:09.491 --> 00:12:13.300
if there's another gas being evolved,
will uh,

199
00:12:13.330 --> 00:12:17.370
collect over the mercury in the Fart tube here so he could measure the CEO,

200
00:12:17.560 --> 00:12:20.050
the carbon by in sugar,

201
00:12:20.320 --> 00:12:23.560
by converting it completely to CO2 through fermentation.

202
00:12:25.480 --> 00:12:28.000
In speaking of a fermentation here,

203
00:12:28.390 --> 00:12:32.440
he says it furnishes of means of analyzing sugar.

204
00:12:33.730 --> 00:12:36.520
Uh,
so oxidation failed with air,

205
00:12:36.550 --> 00:12:39.670
even with oxygen or sulfuric acid or mercuric oxide.

206
00:12:39.770 --> 00:12:43.900
You couldn't get clean combustion of sugar.
You got charring instead.

207
00:12:44.170 --> 00:12:48.130
But as he says here,
this is the most interesting thing about his,
his,
uh,

208
00:12:48.250 --> 00:12:50.260
his treatment of the data.
He said,

209
00:12:50.261 --> 00:12:55.150
I could consider the materials subjected to fermentation and the products of

210
00:12:55.151 --> 00:13:00.151
fermentation as an Algebraic equation having to do with weights.

211
00:13:01.600 --> 00:13:04.330
And what's it,
can you see,
what is assumptions going to be here,

212
00:13:07.410 --> 00:13:08.243
<v 1>Sam?</v>

213
00:13:09.100 --> 00:13:13.120
<v 0>The same weights on both side.
Conservation of mass.
This is assumption.</v>

214
00:13:13.900 --> 00:13:14.733
Okay.

215
00:13:14.950 --> 00:13:17.740
So he can make an equation that the weight on the right and the weight on the

216
00:13:17.741 --> 00:13:22.420
left will be the same.
Okay,
so an Algebraic equation and by in turn,

217
00:13:22.630 --> 00:13:26.380
supposing each of the elements of the equation to be unknown,

218
00:13:26.830 --> 00:13:31.830
I can derive a value and thus correct experiment by calculation and calculation

219
00:13:32.951 --> 00:13:36.010
by experiment.
So what does he mean by that?

220
00:13:37.510 --> 00:13:41.020
So if you have this equation to a certain amount of sugar and a certain amount

221
00:13:41.021 --> 00:13:45.550
of oxygen gives a certain amount of CO2 for example.

222
00:13:45.730 --> 00:13:48.730
Right?
So the weight's on the two sides should be the same.

223
00:13:49.120 --> 00:13:52.280
He doesn't know one of them.
Right?
But,

224
00:13:52.420 --> 00:13:55.480
but if he knows all the others and it's an Algebraic equation,

225
00:13:55.510 --> 00:14:00.400
he can then solve for that one.
So he says,
here,
I can derive a value in this.

226
00:14:00.401 --> 00:14:03.610
Correct.
Experiment by calculation.

227
00:14:04.420 --> 00:14:06.040
Have you ever heard of that being done?

228
00:14:08.050 --> 00:14:08.883
<v 1>Likely.</v>

229
00:14:11.420 --> 00:14:15.230
<v 0>When somebody,
would you do that in lab?
Correct.
Experiment.</v>

230
00:14:15.231 --> 00:14:20.150
You suppose there might be any nefarious people who would correct their

231
00:14:20.151 --> 00:14:23.180
experiments by calculation after finishing the lab?

232
00:14:24.960 --> 00:14:29.940
I can't imagine that would happen.
Okay.
But labanzia was up front,

233
00:14:30.700 --> 00:14:33.230
right?
And he was even one might say bragging about it,

234
00:14:33.680 --> 00:14:38.390
that he has this algebraic equation so we can correct his experiments,
right?

235
00:14:38.600 --> 00:14:42.830
I've often profited from this way of correcting the preliminary results of my

236
00:14:42.831 --> 00:14:43.700
experiments.

237
00:14:44.450 --> 00:14:48.950
No one told him that that's not the way science works,
right?

238
00:14:48.951 --> 00:14:52.280
That the experiments are the things you have to have to adjust the theory

239
00:14:52.280 --> 00:14:55.160
<v 2>to deal with the experiments.
Okay.</v>

240
00:14:56.600 --> 00:14:59.750
So he was,
remember he was,
he was the,
uh,
the,

241
00:14:59.760 --> 00:15:02.260
the treasurer for the firm that,

242
00:15:02.330 --> 00:15:05.990
that collected taxes for the French crown,
right?

243
00:15:05.991 --> 00:15:10.640
So he was accustomed to bookkeeping and everything had to balance right down to

244
00:15:10.641 --> 00:15:15.280
the SU,
right?
So the same thing,
he applied to chemistry.
So he,

245
00:15:15.410 --> 00:15:18.410
so table one here is the materials of fermentation.

246
00:15:18.411 --> 00:15:22.130
He put in a certain amount of water,
400 pounds,

247
00:15:22.340 --> 00:15:25.580
certain amount of sugar or a hundred pounds a yeast.

248
00:15:25.610 --> 00:15:29.690
Now he knew that the yeast was wet.
So there was a certain amount of water.

249
00:15:29.720 --> 00:15:33.470
He tip 10 pounds of yeast,
but he knew by analysis,
uh,

250
00:15:33.500 --> 00:15:37.520
by proximate analysis,
right?
Not how much am I not what the elements are.

251
00:15:37.521 --> 00:15:41.890
But what the substances are there,
there that in 10 pounds of,
of uh,

252
00:15:42.080 --> 00:15:45.500
yeast,
wet yeast,
you'd have seven pounds,
three ounces,

253
00:15:45.740 --> 00:15:48.900
six grow and 44 grains.
Uh,

254
00:15:49.050 --> 00:15:54.050
turns out that a grow is a 70 seconds of a grain and a and eight grow make an

255
00:15:54.471 --> 00:15:55.520
ounce.
So,

256
00:15:55.730 --> 00:15:59.960
so it's a grow is in which is 28.35 grams.
So if you want,

257
00:15:59.961 --> 00:16:00.980
you can work through all this.

258
00:16:01.190 --> 00:16:03.680
Do you think he had analyzed things that accurately

259
00:16:06.160 --> 00:16:10.190
that he knew right down to the,
to the,
uh,
to the grow,

260
00:16:11.330 --> 00:16:14.390
how much there was in there?
No,
he couldn't,

261
00:16:14.450 --> 00:16:17.990
there's no way he could have known that.
But things had to balance.
Right.

262
00:16:18.320 --> 00:16:22.490
So he made an approximate thing and then he carried it out to 18 decimal points

263
00:16:22.491 --> 00:16:26.240
the way you do on a calculator.
Right.
Okay.

264
00:16:26.241 --> 00:16:29.960
So he didn't know about significant figures yet either.
Okay.

265
00:16:30.320 --> 00:16:31.880
So then in Table Two,

266
00:16:32.120 --> 00:16:35.990
he figures in that much in that much water sugar,
yeast.

267
00:16:35.991 --> 00:16:39.920
How much is there of in each one,
how much is in water,

268
00:16:39.921 --> 00:16:42.800
how much is hydrogen and how much is oxygen?
So he knows that.

269
00:16:42.801 --> 00:16:47.801
So now he knows down to hundreds of grow how much of each of those elements

270
00:16:47.931 --> 00:16:52.370
there are in the,
in the 400 pounds of water he's using.
Incidentally,

271
00:16:52.730 --> 00:16:55.160
he never used 400 pounds of water.

272
00:16:55.340 --> 00:16:58.380
He just rounded these numbers up or multiplied his number,

273
00:16:58.381 --> 00:17:03.290
scaled them up to be that big.
He used large quantities but not that large.
Okay.

274
00:17:03.830 --> 00:17:07.400
So if you had a hundred pounds of sugar,
you'd have certain amount of hydrogen,

275
00:17:07.401 --> 00:17:09.440
oxygen and charcoal that is carbon.

276
00:17:09.441 --> 00:17:12.980
And if you had a certain amount of the dry yeast,
you'd have that.

277
00:17:13.250 --> 00:17:16.730
And then he makes still a third table where he rearranges it.

278
00:17:16.731 --> 00:17:19.790
So he pulls the elements altogether.
So in the starting material,

279
00:17:19.791 --> 00:17:23.030
how much hydrogen?
Oxygen.
Carbon.
Okay.

280
00:17:23.090 --> 00:17:28.070
So he's got a 411 pounds,
12 ounces,
six grow,

281
00:17:28.071 --> 00:17:33.071
1.3599999999999999 grains of oxygen in our brains and grow.

282
00:17:33.261 --> 00:17:36.380
Got It.
Oh,
growing grains.
Okay.
Right.
Okay.

283
00:17:36.381 --> 00:17:40.970
That much oxygen and some amount of hydrogen and charcoal and a certain amount

284
00:17:40.971 --> 00:17:45.560
of nitrogen that's in the yeast because that's an,
he knew that was there.
Okay.

285
00:17:45.610 --> 00:17:47.890
Uh,
which is just a small weight all together.

286
00:17:47.891 --> 00:17:51.780
Cause there's not much east and in all 510 pounds.

287
00:17:51.781 --> 00:17:56.340
Exactly right.
So his balance sheet was just like what a banker would want.

288
00:17:57.540 --> 00:17:58.770
Okay.
And now he does,

289
00:17:58.950 --> 00:18:03.950
he looks at the products and he has a certain amount of co two that he collected

290
00:18:04.051 --> 00:18:08.460
that's carbonic acid and he knows how much oxygen charcoal there is that certain

291
00:18:08.461 --> 00:18:09.450
amount of water,

292
00:18:09.840 --> 00:18:13.500
a certain amount of alcohol if if dry.

293
00:18:13.501 --> 00:18:15.240
So he had to collect the alcohol and say how,

294
00:18:15.241 --> 00:18:19.320
how much alcohol and how much water was in it,
but how much a CD Casad,

295
00:18:19.321 --> 00:18:24.321
how much residual sugar that had fermented and how much dry yeast there was at

296
00:18:24.871 --> 00:18:26.820
the end.
And he added them all together.

297
00:18:26.821 --> 00:18:31.080
And by God there was 510 pounds,
zero ounces,

298
00:18:31.081 --> 00:18:34.930
zero bro and zero grains.
Right.
Qed.

299
00:18:37.140 --> 00:18:41.040
Okay.
And then he recapitulated that according to how much oxygen,

300
00:18:41.041 --> 00:18:44.610
how much charcoal and how much hydrogen in that.
Once again,
it balances out.

301
00:18:44.950 --> 00:18:48.660
Absolutely.
Precisely.
Okay.

302
00:18:48.661 --> 00:18:53.640
So we recapitulates it that way and this is how he would do some of these

303
00:18:53.641 --> 00:18:55.020
things.
Okay.

304
00:18:55.470 --> 00:19:00.470
So this is a description of experiment on page 88 to 92 of the Tata Eddie

305
00:19:01.380 --> 00:19:02.460
Monteiro.
Okay,

306
00:19:02.461 --> 00:19:06.450
so he's got a fire burning here and a glass tube that runs through the middle of

307
00:19:06.451 --> 00:19:10.110
the charcoal that's burning,
right?
And he's got a flask,

308
00:19:10.140 --> 00:19:14.430
a cemented to it on the right,
which is over a burner.

309
00:19:15.150 --> 00:19:19.740
And in the tube he puts 28 grains of carbon that,
not pieces,

310
00:19:19.741 --> 00:19:23.400
but a weight of 22 grades.
We saw what a grain was last time.

311
00:19:23.640 --> 00:19:28.590
That turns out to be 1.38 grams of carbon.
He's got inside the tube.

312
00:19:29.610 --> 00:19:33.630
Okay,
and now do you think the carbon will evaporate?
Incidentally,

313
00:19:34.140 --> 00:19:38.400
if you put it in flight?
You know how,
how do you know it won't evaporate?

314
00:19:39.780 --> 00:19:41.580
Where do you get carpet?
What did he call it?

315
00:19:43.770 --> 00:19:48.360
He called the charcoal.
You get charcoal in a fly in,
right?
So with birding,

316
00:19:48.361 --> 00:19:51.450
without enough oxygen.
So obviously it's not going to evaporate,

317
00:19:51.451 --> 00:19:55.980
it's just going to sit there.
Okay?
So in,
in the flask a there,
he puts water.

318
00:19:56.040 --> 00:20:00.000
So there's water in it and then he lights the fire underneath and the water

319
00:20:00.001 --> 00:20:04.890
begins to boil and distills through the tube and collects over here in age.

320
00:20:05.850 --> 00:20:09.200
<v 3>All right.
Okay.</v>

321
00:20:09.710 --> 00:20:11.810
<v 2>What did you notice?
What happened in the process?</v>

322
00:20:15.840 --> 00:20:17.280
Let me back up and do it again.

323
00:20:25.020 --> 00:20:28.800
What happened?
The charcoal went away.

324
00:20:31.260 --> 00:20:35.940
What happened?
Well,
let's see what he found.

325
00:20:36.960 --> 00:20:41.810
So the 28 grades of carbon was gone,
right.

326
00:20:42.390 --> 00:20:45.660
And in the end he got the water that he'd put in at the start,

327
00:20:45.661 --> 00:20:46.950
but not all the water.

328
00:20:47.620 --> 00:20:51.010
It was 85.7 grains short.

329
00:20:55.030 --> 00:20:57.940
So the,
all the carbon in some of the water is gone.

330
00:20:59.400 --> 00:21:00.270
Where did it go?

331
00:21:11.810 --> 00:21:13.280
Well it went out the two,

332
00:21:18.100 --> 00:21:22.930
so out the tube he said came 144 cubic inches.

333
00:21:22.960 --> 00:21:26.500
And because he knows the density,
he knows how much weight that is.

334
00:21:26.501 --> 00:21:28.450
A hundred grains exactly.

335
00:21:28.870 --> 00:21:33.870
Of Carbonic gas co two we would call it c o two and 380 cubic inches of

336
00:21:35.501 --> 00:21:39.730
flammable gas.
So one of them would be collected by lime water,

337
00:21:39.731 --> 00:21:43.150
the carbonic gas and the other one would go right on through.

338
00:21:43.300 --> 00:21:47.020
What do you suppose flammable gas is?
Hydrogen.

339
00:21:47.021 --> 00:21:52.021
So the oxygen went to the carbon and the hydrogen became elemental hydrogen in

340
00:21:52.271 --> 00:21:56.770
this process.
Okay,
now look at this.
This is what's neat.

341
00:21:57.280 --> 00:21:58.630
So you've got a hundred gram,

342
00:21:58.770 --> 00:22:03.770
100 grains probably of of carbonic gas and 13.7 grains of Hydro Jen.

343
00:22:05.020 --> 00:22:08.080
The stuff that gives water when you burn it according to him,
right?

344
00:22:08.200 --> 00:22:11.110
Which is right,
which is correct.
And what do you notice

345
00:22:13.870 --> 00:22:18.610
quantitatively
exactly that,

346
00:22:19.390 --> 00:22:21.640
right down to the tenths of of grains.

347
00:22:24.770 --> 00:22:25.603
<v 3>Okay?</v>

348
00:22:26.850 --> 00:22:29.580
<v 2>Now,
if you recalculate by modern theory,</v>

349
00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:34.800
how much gas you should get from 28 grains of carbon doing this,

350
00:22:35.070 --> 00:22:39.810
you should get a 157 cubic inches and 313 cubic inches.

351
00:22:39.811 --> 00:22:44.811
Instead of 144 three 80 you should get 103 grains of carbonic gas and 9.4 grains

352
00:22:47.041 --> 00:22:50.880
of flammable gas.
So his experiments weren't perfect,
right?

353
00:22:51.150 --> 00:22:55.290
Which is not surprising and there's no shame in that.

354
00:22:56.040 --> 00:22:58.230
But what would we now say he did wrong?

355
00:23:01.060 --> 00:23:04.690
He adjusted his results that fit his theory.
Hey,

356
00:23:04.840 --> 00:23:06.190
but this was early days.

357
00:23:07.240 --> 00:23:10.510
He thought that he actually said on page 92,

358
00:23:10.720 --> 00:23:15.720
I have thought it best to correct by calculation and to present the experiment

359
00:23:16.241 --> 00:23:17.680
in all its simplicity.

360
00:23:18.340 --> 00:23:22.660
Now what's wrong with presenting experiment in all its simplicity.

361
00:23:24.460 --> 00:23:26.470
You lose anything that's new.

362
00:23:27.100 --> 00:23:31.550
Anything that you might have discovered in the experiment.
Okay.
But,

363
00:23:31.560 --> 00:23:34.660
but he was discovering a lot of stuff so we'll forgive him that.
Okay.

364
00:23:34.810 --> 00:23:39.160
He was certainly a great scientist.
So what were his contributions?

365
00:23:40.030 --> 00:23:43.120
Clarity above all right.

366
00:23:43.630 --> 00:23:48.380
This idea of facts and ideas and words having to go together and improve

367
00:23:48.381 --> 00:23:52.070
together and have the facts he worked on.
There were these,

368
00:23:52.340 --> 00:23:56.300
the apparatus I showed and others as well.
Important,

369
00:23:56.301 --> 00:23:58.030
important thing was quantitative,

370
00:23:58.190 --> 00:24:02.870
using numbers which people hadn't used before at not nearly as effectively.

371
00:24:02.871 --> 00:24:06.050
At least concentrating on making things balance,

372
00:24:06.560 --> 00:24:10.040
using mass as the criteria for how much stuff you have,

373
00:24:10.220 --> 00:24:14.840
but also in the case of,
of uh,
of gasses volume,

374
00:24:14.930 --> 00:24:18.680
but measuring the density so that you can relate volume to mass,

375
00:24:18.681 --> 00:24:21.500
which is the fundamental quantity.
Uh,

376
00:24:22.040 --> 00:24:23.840
he found some new substances,

377
00:24:23.841 --> 00:24:26.570
although that wasn't much of a contribution on his part.

378
00:24:26.571 --> 00:24:30.830
Other people like Shayla before him had discovered lots and lots of new pure

379
00:24:30.831 --> 00:24:35.270
substances that wasn't [inaudible] strong suit and reactions.

380
00:24:35.750 --> 00:24:39.240
And the,
uh,
then with respect to ideas,
uh,

381
00:24:39.560 --> 00:24:43.640
the idea of what an element is that it's not some Playtonic ideal,

382
00:24:43.820 --> 00:24:47.840
but it only means as far as we've so far been able to go and analyze in things

383
00:24:47.841 --> 00:24:50.810
and breaking them down.
And if we can't break them down further,

384
00:24:50.811 --> 00:24:53.930
we'll assume for the time being that they are elements.

385
00:24:53.931 --> 00:24:56.390
But it may be that they won't be in the long run.

386
00:24:56.810 --> 00:24:59.000
The idea of conservation of mass,
of course,

387
00:24:59.001 --> 00:25:03.100
is key oxidation as the organizing principle.
Uh,

388
00:25:03.170 --> 00:25:07.400
the idea of a radical than an element is the base of something and that it can

389
00:25:07.401 --> 00:25:11.940
become an acid through oxidation.
And the idea of salts be,
uh,

390
00:25:12.120 --> 00:25:15.280
uh,
from,
from mixing of,
of,
uh,

391
00:25:15.290 --> 00:25:18.770
elements and with respect to words,

392
00:25:18.771 --> 00:25:23.771
the idea that names should be meaningful in particular the names for element's,

393
00:25:24.890 --> 00:25:29.240
oxidation states.
So he developed these,
these uh,
suffixes,
us,

394
00:25:29.260 --> 00:25:34.260
[inaudible] I eight and eight are all due to Lovaza and the idea of assault

395
00:25:34.671 --> 00:25:38.260
composition,
the way of naming them that,
uh,

396
00:25:39.200 --> 00:25:43.880
sodium hydroxide for example,
or sodium chloride or,

397
00:25:44.300 --> 00:25:46.550
or chlorate or chlorite,

398
00:25:46.850 --> 00:25:51.080
which are different degrees of oxidation of the,
of the element.

399
00:25:51.890 --> 00:25:52.101
Okay.

400
00:25:52.101 --> 00:25:57.101
But like everyone who would follow and everyone before and everyone nowadays,

401
00:25:57.410 --> 00:26:00.890
he was plagued by lack of imagination,
right?

402
00:26:00.891 --> 00:26:04.000
That's always the short suit of a,

403
00:26:04.010 --> 00:26:08.630
everyone who's in science are probably in anything.
Uh,
he said,

404
00:26:08.870 --> 00:26:11.480
Kevin at the end of this preface that we've talked about,

405
00:26:11.800 --> 00:26:13.940
chemistry is president progress,
however,

406
00:26:13.941 --> 00:26:18.860
is so rapid and the facts under modern doctrine have assumed so happy and

407
00:26:18.861 --> 00:26:23.861
arrangement that we have ground to hope even in our own times to see it approach

408
00:26:24.600 --> 00:26:29.180
near to the highest state of perfection of which it is susceptible,
right?

409
00:26:29.180 --> 00:26:32.090
So people always think that,
that,
that,

410
00:26:32.150 --> 00:26:35.300
that there are a few things that you can see you have to do to fill in little

411
00:26:35.301 --> 00:26:39.470
chunks here and there,
but otherwise we've got it now.
Right?

412
00:26:39.471 --> 00:26:43.910
This is certainly what a lot of people tended to think about human geno.

413
00:26:43.920 --> 00:26:48.000
Once you know what the human genome is,
then all diseases are solved.

414
00:26:48.030 --> 00:26:50.460
Everything else,
right.
It's never been true.

415
00:26:50.461 --> 00:26:52.470
And it almost certainly is not true now.

416
00:26:53.010 --> 00:26:57.120
And it certainly wasn't true in his time.
He said,
even in our own times,

417
00:26:57.330 --> 00:27:02.330
he wrote this in 1789 and in 1794 he was Ghia team,

418
00:27:03.870 --> 00:27:08.730
so he shouldn't certainly didn't happen in his own time.
Uh,
the,

419
00:27:08.731 --> 00:27:13.731
the judge co-fund hall is reported to have said all the perhaps apocryphally

420
00:27:14.650 --> 00:27:18.630
that the Republican has no need of geniuses.
And in fact,

421
00:27:18.631 --> 00:27:21.060
all his equipment was seized for the people,

422
00:27:21.061 --> 00:27:24.960
including his 80 pounds of mercury that he carried around in this thing to

423
00:27:24.961 --> 00:27:25.900
measure gasses.

424
00:27:27.120 --> 00:27:31.650
That madness lasted only a couple of years,

425
00:27:31.710 --> 00:27:33.060
maybe not even that long.

426
00:27:33.390 --> 00:27:38.150
And his widow recovered the equipment and it currently is in the museum days

427
00:27:38.151 --> 00:27:41.910
after they meet ta and in Paris.
I've never seen it,

428
00:27:41.911 --> 00:27:45.480
but a number of students from the class have sent me postcards when they've gone

429
00:27:45.481 --> 00:27:49.230
to see it.
Okay.
And La Garage.

430
00:27:49.231 --> 00:27:54.090
The guy that helped him build the calorimeter,
uh,
wrote it,

431
00:27:54.091 --> 00:27:56.550
took them only an instant to make this head to fall.

432
00:27:56.551 --> 00:28:00.150
But a 100 years may not suffice to reproduce one like it.

433
00:28:00.390 --> 00:28:04.260
So what we're going to look at is what the heads in the next hundred years we're

434
00:28:04.261 --> 00:28:05.670
able to accomplish.

435
00:28:05.910 --> 00:28:10.910
So today we're going to do the first 20 year or 25 or 30 years after Lovaza Aa

436
00:28:11.970 --> 00:28:13.110
to see where things went.

437
00:28:13.470 --> 00:28:18.370
So we've looked at Boyle and his gas laws and Lavoie ca and now we're going to

438
00:28:18.371 --> 00:28:19.470
go onto Dolton.

439
00:28:20.520 --> 00:28:25.520
So here's John Dalton who lived up near the Lake district in England and it was

440
00:28:25.861 --> 00:28:27.390
an amateur meteorologist.

441
00:28:27.390 --> 00:28:30.330
So he was interested in keeping weather records and so on.

442
00:28:30.331 --> 00:28:34.290
And in particular he was interested in why in the atmosphere,

443
00:28:34.470 --> 00:28:38.580
if you take a collect air at the top of a mountain and down in the bottom of a

444
00:28:38.581 --> 00:28:41.220
valley,
you get the same composition.

445
00:28:41.610 --> 00:28:45.090
Why don't the heavier gasses sink and the lighter ones rise?

446
00:28:46.530 --> 00:28:48.630
Good question.
Right?
Well,

447
00:28:48.631 --> 00:28:53.631
people on the continent had proposed that different gases attract one another.

448
00:28:53.940 --> 00:28:57.570
So they tend to stick and therefore stay mixed,
right?

449
00:28:57.840 --> 00:29:02.250
But Dalton had a different idea,
and this is a picture he drew of,
of gasses.

450
00:29:02.251 --> 00:29:07.050
The top is a up or uh,
or nitrogen in the bottom is hydrogen.

451
00:29:07.440 --> 00:29:12.440
So he said the Adams of one kind or did not repel the Adams of another kind.

452
00:29:14.460 --> 00:29:16.620
It's not,
well,
you'll see just a second.
Okay.

453
00:29:16.621 --> 00:29:20.730
So the center is his symbol for the Adam nitrogen in that case,

454
00:29:20.940 --> 00:29:21.930
and surrounding that,

455
00:29:21.931 --> 00:29:26.931
this sort of Halo is the envelope that's heat associated with that particular

456
00:29:27.211 --> 00:29:28.020
item.

457
00:29:28.020 --> 00:29:33.020
So these rays come out and if the rays meet one another between adjacent atoms

458
00:29:33.601 --> 00:29:37.680
in the gas,
then they repel one another according to Dalton's theory.

459
00:29:37.980 --> 00:29:42.010
But if they don't match as in hydrogen and nitrogen,

460
00:29:42.020 --> 00:29:44.620
then they don't repel one another,
right?

461
00:29:44.950 --> 00:29:48.370
So Adams of the same element can to stay apart.

462
00:29:48.700 --> 00:29:52.300
But the Adams of the other element are completely free to be inside there.

463
00:29:52.420 --> 00:29:56.650
They knew that the pressure went down as you went up.
That was no question.
Right?

464
00:29:56.651 --> 00:29:58.390
But why?
Why don't they stratify?

465
00:29:58.391 --> 00:30:02.080
It's because the different elements don't repel one another.

466
00:30:02.380 --> 00:30:07.380
So he substituted homo repulsion that the same atoms repel one another for what

467
00:30:08.381 --> 00:30:13.330
the Europeans used as Hetero attraction.
Okay.

468
00:30:14.080 --> 00:30:17.770
Obviously that turned out to be nonsense.
But,
uh,

469
00:30:17.980 --> 00:30:22.980
Dalton developed three principles in terms of these atoms that he had that he

470
00:30:23.411 --> 00:30:28.030
had,
uh,
started using for this purpose of something about the atmosphere.

471
00:30:28.420 --> 00:30:32.050
These principles have come to be known as definite proportions,

472
00:30:32.350 --> 00:30:35.500
equivalent proportions,
and multiple proportions.

473
00:30:36.310 --> 00:30:41.310
So definite proportions is that pure compounds always have the same weight ratio

474
00:30:42.191 --> 00:30:47.080
of their elements.
So you don't get a sample of,
uh,

475
00:30:47.290 --> 00:30:49.210
of uh,
sugar here.

476
00:30:49.330 --> 00:30:53.290
That's a certain percentage of carbon and hydrogen and a slightly different

477
00:30:53.291 --> 00:30:54.880
percentage of carbon hydrogen here.

478
00:30:54.881 --> 00:30:59.620
And he explains it by saying that these compounds are a given ratio of elements.

479
00:30:59.650 --> 00:31:04.000
So you have that same ratio all the time when you have a particular compound.

480
00:31:04.270 --> 00:31:08.770
Now,
equivalent proportions is a pretty simple idea,
but it looks complex.

481
00:31:09.190 --> 00:31:09.461
Okay?

482
00:31:09.461 --> 00:31:14.380
So suppose you have a certain weight of a reacts with a certain way to be okay

483
00:31:14.381 --> 00:31:15.020
to form a,

484
00:31:15.020 --> 00:31:20.020
B and a certain amount of a react with a certain amount of c to form a c.

485
00:31:21.640 --> 00:31:23.530
But if it's the same amount of a,

486
00:31:23.890 --> 00:31:28.750
then in some sense a certain that way to be and that weight of see are

487
00:31:28.751 --> 00:31:33.400
equivalent to one another.
Okay.
Cause they react with the same way to a,

488
00:31:34.450 --> 00:31:35.410
so they're equivalent.

489
00:31:35.770 --> 00:31:40.770
But now suppose you have another compound d that also reacts with B parts of B

490
00:31:43.660 --> 00:31:47.830
a reacted with be parts of B.
Right?
What does that tell you

491
00:31:49.930 --> 00:31:51.070
about equivalence?

492
00:31:53.800 --> 00:31:57.880
That means that a parts of Ey is equivalent to deep parts of d.

493
00:31:59.310 --> 00:32:00.143
<v 3>Okay.</v>

494
00:32:01.770 --> 00:32:06.140
<v 2>So just for suppose a two grams of a re,
uh,
uh,</v>

495
00:32:06.240 --> 00:32:11.240
reacted with three grams of B and two grams of a reacted with eight grams of c,

496
00:32:13.170 --> 00:32:17.100
that means three grams of B is equal to eight grams of c for purposes of

497
00:32:17.101 --> 00:32:20.850
combining.
Okay.
And suppose,
uh,

498
00:32:20.880 --> 00:32:24.840
1.5 grams of d also reacted with three grams of B,

499
00:32:25.230 --> 00:32:30.180
then 1.5 grams of d is equal to one gram of A.
Okay.

500
00:32:30.690 --> 00:32:33.750
Now what could you conclude?
What's the final line going to be?

501
00:32:33.840 --> 00:32:35.130
What do you predict from this?

502
00:32:35.160 --> 00:32:38.610
If you have these kinds of equivalents and equivalence between B and C and

503
00:32:38.611 --> 00:32:41.980
equivalence between a
safe,

504
00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:48.770
then you predict that if you react d and see what's going to happen,

505
00:32:50.300 --> 00:32:52.290
what rate ratio will they be on?

506
00:32:53.620 --> 00:32:57.830
D parts of d will react with c parts of see,
right?

507
00:32:58.040 --> 00:33:02.750
Because the D is like the a in the beginning of the sea is like the be in the

508
00:33:02.751 --> 00:33:06.470
beginning.
So deep parts of Asia react to seed parts to see that's what multiple

509
00:33:06.471 --> 00:33:10.520
proportions is.
I'll show you an example.
Okay.
And finally,

510
00:33:10.521 --> 00:33:13.910
multiple proportions if the same two elements formed,

511
00:33:13.911 --> 00:33:15.770
several different compounds.

512
00:33:16.010 --> 00:33:19.340
The weight ratios are related by simple factors,

513
00:33:20.150 --> 00:33:21.770
and I'll show you an example of that.

514
00:33:22.190 --> 00:33:27.190
So these are all things that Dalton at deuced as support for the idea that

515
00:33:27.831 --> 00:33:31.730
things were made of atoms,
fundamental units.

516
00:33:31.940 --> 00:33:34.550
Now definite proportions do this,

517
00:33:34.551 --> 00:33:39.551
this the same compound always have the same ratio of the elements in in it.

518
00:33:40.200 --> 00:33:43.820
The,
the,
the French school was divided on this question,

519
00:33:44.270 --> 00:33:46.550
belittle a said no.

520
00:33:47.630 --> 00:33:50.050
And Proust said wait,

521
00:33:50.540 --> 00:33:55.520
because he said they're metal alloys or natural organic materials that that vary

522
00:33:55.521 --> 00:34:00.380
in their analysis.
Right.
Okay.
And Preuss said,

523
00:34:00.770 --> 00:34:05.770
we write and that defined what chemistry was,

524
00:34:08.630 --> 00:34:13.550
that chemists then began to deal only with things that obeyed this law of

525
00:34:13.551 --> 00:34:14.840
multiple proportions.

526
00:34:15.140 --> 00:34:19.250
They didn't deal in fundamental ways with alloys are with,

527
00:34:19.430 --> 00:34:24.020
with a complicated big molecules that had really complicated formulas or

528
00:34:24.260 --> 00:34:28.340
couldn't be separated as mixtures and therefore got different analysis at

529
00:34:28.341 --> 00:34:29.174
different times.

530
00:34:29.420 --> 00:34:34.100
They assume that anything that was pure had this obeyed the law of definite

531
00:34:34.101 --> 00:34:38.150
proportions.
So it was really more of a definition right,

532
00:34:38.300 --> 00:34:42.530
than a law.
Okay.
Now,
multiple proportions.

533
00:34:42.740 --> 00:34:47.140
So there were oxides of carbon.
You remember Lavoie Oza 1789 fine,

534
00:34:47.141 --> 00:34:51.830
44% carbon,
56% oxygen and co two and there again there,

535
00:34:51.840 --> 00:34:54.890
there are problems for you to work together to see how he did some of these

536
00:34:54.891 --> 00:34:57.110
things.
So that's one of them,
I believe.

537
00:34:57.620 --> 00:35:00.590
And then in 18 one carbonic acid as it was called,

538
00:35:00.591 --> 00:35:05.591
was analyzed and found to be 28 grams of carbon to 72 to 72 grams of oxygen.

539
00:35:07.430 --> 00:35:10.040
Okay.
Or in the case of op nitrogen,

540
00:35:10.041 --> 00:35:15.041
there were several oxides that had these ratios all as analyzed in 1810 right

541
00:35:17.750 --> 00:35:18.500
now,
uh,

542
00:35:18.500 --> 00:35:22.370
you can look at their weight ratios if you want to oxygen to carbon ratio in the

543
00:35:22.371 --> 00:35:27.371
first one is 1.27 the others 2.57 or you can look in the oxides of nitrogen and

544
00:35:28.041 --> 00:35:33.041
they're 0.58 1.27 2.39 right now.

545
00:35:36.590 --> 00:35:39.930
What do you notice about these?
You'll learn anything from this.

546
00:35:40.340 --> 00:35:41.173
<v 3>Okay.</v>

547
00:35:44.390 --> 00:35:47.680
<v 2>That'd be these guys got these results and sat down and scratched their heads.</v>

548
00:35:47.860 --> 00:35:49.930
What did they come up with?
Anything profound?

549
00:35:51.580 --> 00:35:54.070
Any relationships among these numbers that you can see?

550
00:35:55.890 --> 00:35:57.510
Are they just sort of random numbers?

551
00:36:03.560 --> 00:36:04.760
<v 3>Yeah.
Nick,</v>

552
00:36:07.240 --> 00:36:12.240
<v 2>can you speak up a little pellets at 1.27 1.27 is very close to half of 2.5 so</v>

553
00:36:13.810 --> 00:36:17.230
it's not exact,
but there's going to be experimental error,
right?

554
00:36:17.410 --> 00:36:18.880
It's about one to two.

555
00:36:19.240 --> 00:36:22.810
It's actually 2.02 and if you look in the case of nitrogen,

556
00:36:22.960 --> 00:36:25.630
it's one to two to four right?

557
00:36:25.631 --> 00:36:29.020
It's actually 2.19 and 4.12 so as always,

558
00:36:29.021 --> 00:36:31.990
when people develop things experimentally and,
and,

559
00:36:32.260 --> 00:36:36.970
and observe and observe regularities,
there's the question of what,

560
00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:40.000
what's,
what's real and what's just experimental error?

561
00:36:40.001 --> 00:36:43.300
And you have no way of knowing at the beginning we'd have a way of knowing now,

562
00:36:43.301 --> 00:36:45.640
cause we know what the,
what the true waits are.

563
00:36:45.820 --> 00:36:49.720
So they're integral values consistent with simple atomic ratios.

564
00:36:50.050 --> 00:36:54.610
So now we know what the percent errors were in these things.
Okay.
That,

565
00:36:54.640 --> 00:36:55.473
that uh,

566
00:36:55.730 --> 00:37:00.730
that the ratio or the air was about 5% or 4% off for what it should have been.

567
00:37:01.870 --> 00:37:02.860
And then oxygen,

568
00:37:02.861 --> 00:37:07.861
nitrogen one is minus 2% others are plus 11% so within roughly 5% or so,

569
00:37:10.420 --> 00:37:12.670
they were doing pretty good job of the analysis,

570
00:37:12.880 --> 00:37:17.550
but they were able to see through to this law of multiple proportions think,

571
00:37:17.740 --> 00:37:19.300
and that's what you would expect if,

572
00:37:19.510 --> 00:37:23.710
if these things were made up of identical molecules with simple ratios of

573
00:37:23.711 --> 00:37:28.030
numbers of Adams in them.
So this tended to support Dalton's ideas of Adams.

574
00:37:28.810 --> 00:37:31.770
Okay.
So we've looked at Lavoie,

575
00:37:31.780 --> 00:37:36.780
ca and now we're on further into elemental analysis doing accurate elemental

576
00:37:37.931 --> 00:37:41.020
analysis and the idea of Adams and dualism.

577
00:37:41.021 --> 00:37:43.540
And we'll see what that is right away.
And to do that,

578
00:37:43.810 --> 00:37:46.060
we're going to focus on Brett's alias,

579
00:37:46.330 --> 00:37:50.920
but also talk about gay Lou sock.
Okay,

580
00:37:50.921 --> 00:37:51.754
so there,

581
00:37:51.790 --> 00:37:55.570
there's fair day who we've talked about already are salient and Galas sock and

582
00:37:55.571 --> 00:37:58.270
also Davey in England.
Okay.

583
00:37:58.271 --> 00:38:03.271
So here's [inaudible] is in Sweden more than 1779 is you notice on the previous

584
00:38:03.281 --> 00:38:06.160
slide,
all those guys were born within a year,

585
00:38:06.280 --> 00:38:10.540
1778 1779 and another guy that was born at the same time didn't make it to the

586
00:38:10.541 --> 00:38:13.420
list,
but his statue is right below who's Benjamin Selman.

587
00:38:13.660 --> 00:38:15.820
He was exactly the same time.
Okay?

588
00:38:15.821 --> 00:38:20.740
So here's a bit salients who lived to be almost 70 years old and did an awful

589
00:38:20.741 --> 00:38:23.830
lot of stuff.
So he was very good at analysis,

590
00:38:23.860 --> 00:38:28.040
both of organic substances and of minerals.
He in,

591
00:38:28.170 --> 00:38:29.590
in a period of six years,

592
00:38:29.591 --> 00:38:34.090
he accurately analyze 2000 compounds for their elements.

593
00:38:35.420 --> 00:38:38.770
He,
he developed really good atomic weights.

594
00:38:38.771 --> 00:38:42.430
Remember we just saw that these previous ones were off by as much as 10,
10,

595
00:38:42.431 --> 00:38:46.510
or 11%,
but he got very good ones for 50 different elements.

596
00:38:47.290 --> 00:38:49.630
Okay.
He studied electrolysis,

597
00:38:49.631 --> 00:38:54.631
which we will see and use that to develop the theory of dualism and how

598
00:38:54.671 --> 00:38:57.550
understanding reactions as double d compositions.

599
00:38:57.551 --> 00:39:01.840
And we'll certainly see what that is.
And he did a lot of teaching and writing.

600
00:39:01.841 --> 00:39:06.370
He was the most respected,
uh,
chemist worldwide.
Uh,

601
00:39:06.390 --> 00:39:09.790
he'd chosen his picture.
Remember what these people got their pictures painted.

602
00:39:09.790 --> 00:39:11.950
They always chose some emblem to put in.

603
00:39:12.280 --> 00:39:15.250
And he chose his textbooks that he wrote in 18,
three.

604
00:39:15.460 --> 00:39:19.960
But he was a very important editor and summarizer of the year's progress in

605
00:39:20.200 --> 00:39:22.570
chemistry every year.
Uh,

606
00:39:22.630 --> 00:39:27.280
and he developed the notation that we still use for composition.

607
00:39:28.120 --> 00:39:31.300
So you'll see that,
okay.
Notation for composition.

608
00:39:31.301 --> 00:39:35.920
We're going to look at its evolution from alchemy through Dalton to parts alias,

609
00:39:35.980 --> 00:39:39.400
which is what we use almost exactly.
Okay.

610
00:39:39.401 --> 00:39:43.030
So in 1774,
this is a table printed in Sweden,

611
00:39:43.360 --> 00:39:48.250
have symbols for,
uh,
four elements and compounds.
And you'll see,

612
00:39:48.251 --> 00:39:50.040
for example,
here is vitriol.

613
00:39:50.170 --> 00:39:53.750
Copree or vitriol chip.
Uh,

614
00:39:53.840 --> 00:39:57.700
[inaudible] you know what about Q three?

615
00:39:57.701 --> 00:40:02.350
That's the symbol there of copper,
right?
So what,

616
00:40:02.351 --> 00:40:05.670
why would they call it?
Why would it have been called Cerulean?

617
00:40:07.600 --> 00:40:11.550
And you see any word that's related to that?
What's the rule?

618
00:40:11.580 --> 00:40:15.660
The other about it
that's up here.

619
00:40:21.340 --> 00:40:26.140
That's not it.
That's not it.
This is it.

620
00:40:26.960 --> 00:40:31.810
Surillian right?
Like the sky.
Okay.

621
00:40:32.260 --> 00:40:33.880
Uh,
or iron.

622
00:40:33.881 --> 00:40:38.881
There's the alchemical symbol of iron ore and vitriol mean sulfate,

623
00:40:39.190 --> 00:40:43.990
right?
Or Mercury sulfate.
Okay.
Led.
Okay.

624
00:40:43.991 --> 00:40:48.010
So these are the chemical symbols.
No notice particularly nitro,
him at the top.

625
00:40:48.310 --> 00:40:50.890
That's comes from nitrates.
Okay?

626
00:40:50.891 --> 00:40:55.120
And we'll focus on that and see that.

627
00:40:55.121 --> 00:40:59.380
That's exactly the same symbol that Dolton used for nitrogen.

628
00:41:00.040 --> 00:41:03.520
So he derived his symbols for Adams from the alchemical symbols,

629
00:41:03.521 --> 00:41:06.760
at least many of them,
not all of them.
Here are some others.

630
00:41:06.761 --> 00:41:11.020
And here are the symbols that Brett's alias used for the same elements,

631
00:41:11.140 --> 00:41:15.890
which you see are the ones we use now.
Okay?
So notice as you did,

632
00:41:15.940 --> 00:41:19.450
so there are al chemical symbols at the beginning for Dalton as you went across.

633
00:41:19.690 --> 00:41:24.530
But in the next row,
once you get to iron,
which is Effie in Brasilia is,

634
00:41:24.700 --> 00:41:28.150
can you see what it is?
It's a little hard to read at this resolution.

635
00:41:28.151 --> 00:41:31.780
It's a little circle with a letter inside.
What's the letter for iron?

636
00:41:33.110 --> 00:41:37.010
Can you say it?
It's in the middle of the second row.

637
00:41:38.480 --> 00:41:41.990
It's an eye.
Sorry.
It's not such good resolution.

638
00:41:42.560 --> 00:41:47.120
And the next one is z and then c and then l,
Y,

639
00:41:49.430 --> 00:41:53.240
Z,
Zake.
See

640
00:41:54.790 --> 00:41:58.640
Copper,
hell led and so on.

641
00:41:59.390 --> 00:42:04.010
Okay.
Now in the now below that are binary symbol.

642
00:42:04.011 --> 00:42:07.250
So you put two elements together like h with O,

643
00:42:07.251 --> 00:42:10.970
h within and with O,
h with c,
O with see.

644
00:42:11.510 --> 00:42:16.270
Now here's Dalton's logic about these symbols.
He said,
oops,

645
00:42:16.290 --> 00:42:16.880
sorry.

646
00:42:16.880 --> 00:42:21.880
He says when only one combination of two bodies can be obtained,

647
00:42:22.340 --> 00:42:25.880
it must be presumed to be a binary one.
That is,

648
00:42:25.881 --> 00:42:28.400
if you get only one compound,

649
00:42:28.700 --> 00:42:33.290
it must be one atom of one and one atom of the other.
Right?

650
00:42:33.290 --> 00:42:34.490
So what would water be?

651
00:42:36.300 --> 00:42:40.550
H O or his circle with a dot of the circle.
Right.

652
00:42:41.300 --> 00:42:43.850
Unless some other cause appear to the contrary.

653
00:42:43.851 --> 00:42:47.510
That would show you that that's not what you should assume.
Okay?
The next row,

654
00:42:47.511 --> 00:42:52.160
the ternary ones and two O and o,
two zero two ch two.

655
00:42:52.670 --> 00:42:56.930
And what he said about that is when two combinations are observed of the same

656
00:42:56.931 --> 00:42:57.764
elements,

657
00:42:58.160 --> 00:43:02.720
then they must be presumed to be a binary and a ternary.

658
00:43:03.050 --> 00:43:05.630
So you'd have eno and an o two.

659
00:43:06.320 --> 00:43:09.700
What if there are three combinations of the same elements that are you of

660
00:43:09.710 --> 00:43:13.940
compounds?
You see what he's going to observe,
but he's going to suppose

661
00:43:17.600 --> 00:43:21.680
when three of visionary and the other two turnery.

662
00:43:24.160 --> 00:43:24.993
<v 3>Okay?</v>

663
00:43:26.790 --> 00:43:28.440
<v 2>Okay.
And how about if there for</v>

664
00:43:31.430 --> 00:43:35.630
when for one binary to turnery and one quaternary.

665
00:43:37.700 --> 00:43:38.330
Okay,

666
00:43:38.330 --> 00:43:42.980
so he's laying down rules of logic for what the way atoms must behave.

667
00:43:43.340 --> 00:43:47.630
And it turns out,
as we know,
Adams have different ideas from Dalton's logic.

668
00:43:48.860 --> 00:43:51.500
Nothing illogical about Dalton.
It's just wrong.

669
00:43:53.450 --> 00:43:58.160
Okay?
And this is Brett's alias is notation for the same symbols that Dalton,

670
00:43:58.560 --> 00:44:00.020
uh,
gave on the left.

671
00:44:00.021 --> 00:44:03.770
But you notice they're completely recognizable to them except for one thing.

672
00:44:03.771 --> 00:44:04.604
What's different

673
00:44:06.440 --> 00:44:10.180
here was ours and here is presale.
He assists.

674
00:44:12.020 --> 00:44:15.230
The only difference is he used superscripts instead of subscripts.

675
00:44:17.480 --> 00:44:21.680
Okay.
And he decided to base the names on Latin so it would be international.

676
00:44:21.681 --> 00:44:26.390
Whereas Dalton had used English and the formula's notice are not structural.

677
00:44:26.630 --> 00:44:29.930
You might,
the bulk purchase aliases aren't,
they're just written in a line.

678
00:44:29.931 --> 00:44:33.120
And the number of these could been assumed to be structural that you thought the

679
00:44:33.121 --> 00:44:37.470
Adams were arranged that way.
I don't know that Dalton really had that idea,

680
00:44:37.471 --> 00:44:41.580
but they have,
they sort of convey that idea.
But for sale is,
is don't,

681
00:44:41.710 --> 00:44:46.080
they're just a list of the elements and the ratio by weight of Adams in them.

682
00:44:46.610 --> 00:44:51.090
And he developed some more fancy abbreviations as well,
where,
for example,

683
00:44:51.091 --> 00:44:55.110
these little dots above elements would show how much oxygen was associated with

684
00:44:55.111 --> 00:44:55.500
it.

685
00:44:55.500 --> 00:45:00.500
So that chromium [inaudible] Chroma [inaudible] was k with an o and chromium

686
00:45:01.501 --> 00:45:05.700
with three o's.
Or down here he has some even fancier things.

687
00:45:05.701 --> 00:45:09.510
Notice the superscripts to note the number of atoms,
uh,

688
00:45:09.540 --> 00:45:12.230
and that this benzoic acid,
uh,

689
00:45:12.480 --> 00:45:16.560
should be age 10 see 1403.
Now wait a second.

690
00:45:16.561 --> 00:45:18.930
I carboxylic acid has how many oxygens

691
00:45:21.280 --> 00:45:24.520
Carbox elite group to hear.
He's got three.

692
00:45:25.120 --> 00:45:28.270
The reason is that he thought there was water in these acids,

693
00:45:28.271 --> 00:45:30.460
so he did the heck out and to drive water out.

694
00:45:30.790 --> 00:45:33.340
And what you actually were left with was the anhydrite.

695
00:45:33.550 --> 00:45:36.760
So two assets that come together and lost water,
right?

696
00:45:36.761 --> 00:45:41.761
So the formula should be see 10 see 1403 it's got c h 12 see 15 so not so far

697
00:45:43.511 --> 00:45:47.590
off and he's got these neat symbols for as a CD.

698
00:45:47.920 --> 00:45:51.250
Tartaric,
Cedric and so on.
Acid that those didn't catch on either.

699
00:45:51.520 --> 00:45:54.310
But is it symbols for the elements did.

700
00:45:55.840 --> 00:46:00.100
Now let's see what we got here.
One more topic.
Atomic weights and equivalents.

701
00:46:00.610 --> 00:46:05.470
Okay.
These are Dalton's atomic weights that he used,
an 18 eight hydrogen one,

702
00:46:05.790 --> 00:46:09.700
a carbon fee,
five nitrogen,
five oxygen seven and so on.

703
00:46:10.210 --> 00:46:14.140
Now as of 2004 this is what they should have been.

704
00:46:14.200 --> 00:46:15.520
What's wrong with Dalton?

705
00:46:16.630 --> 00:46:17.463
<v 3>Okay,</v>

706
00:46:19.520 --> 00:46:22.610
<v 2>why is he so off so far?
For example,
in oxygen,</v>

707
00:46:22.611 --> 00:46:25.010
which should be 16 and he has seven

708
00:46:30.170 --> 00:46:33.770
how can he be off that much?
True.
Get here.

709
00:46:35.370 --> 00:46:39.440
Yeah.
What did he think?
Water was h oh,

710
00:46:40.070 --> 00:46:44.450
we know it's h two o.
So the ratio is off by a factor of two,

711
00:46:44.780 --> 00:46:46.820
right?
So all of these are off.

712
00:46:46.880 --> 00:46:50.270
Most of these are off by a factor of two or three depending on what the true

713
00:46:50.271 --> 00:46:54.740
formula we now know to be.
Okay.
But if you make that correction,
this is how,

714
00:46:54.800 --> 00:46:57.770
what kind of errors he had in his atomic waste.

715
00:46:57.771 --> 00:47:01.340
They were roughly 10% or so errors.
Right?

716
00:47:02.480 --> 00:47:05.080
And the question in silicon chloride,
uh,

717
00:47:05.120 --> 00:47:08.750
Thomas Thompson in Scotland thought it was s ICL,

718
00:47:09.060 --> 00:47:11.630
Gmail and in Germany thought it was sic l two,

719
00:47:11.631 --> 00:47:16.520
but Sally has thought it was sic l three and oddly in England thought it was sic

720
00:47:16.521 --> 00:47:20.570
l four so you can have anything you wanted.
Right?

721
00:47:20.810 --> 00:47:24.950
So which one is it?
How can you tell which one it is?
That's the problem.

722
00:47:26.120 --> 00:47:30.850
Okay.
So this is when Galeas socked in.
Uh,
France gets into the act.

723
00:47:31.360 --> 00:47:34.270
So in 18 four,
he,
uh,

724
00:47:34.330 --> 00:47:37.060
and the physicist vo made a balloon,

725
00:47:37.061 --> 00:47:41.680
a set to a height of 7,000 meters.
That's way the heck up there.
And in fact,

726
00:47:41.681 --> 00:47:46.420
that was a record for the 50 years and they have a flat,
a big flask there.

727
00:47:46.430 --> 00:47:50.050
Carrie,
why?
What do they want to do with our big flask?

728
00:47:52.360 --> 00:47:56.360
Collect air at 7,000 meters and see if it's different.
Okay.

729
00:47:57.160 --> 00:48:00.850
Okay.
So they established it.
Atmospheric composition is invariant with altitude,

730
00:48:00.880 --> 00:48:03.220
at least at the heights naked do.

731
00:48:03.370 --> 00:48:06.010
But that's not the most important thing he did for our purpose.

732
00:48:06.280 --> 00:48:09.520
What are the really important things that did was figure out how to oxidize

733
00:48:09.521 --> 00:48:14.410
sugar,
how to burn sugar cleanly.
Remember,
Lavasa had to resort the fermentation,

734
00:48:14.710 --> 00:48:18.010
but he found if the source of the oxidation with sodium chloride,

735
00:48:18.280 --> 00:48:22.710
then you could hit them together and actually get it right and get water and co

736
00:48:22.720 --> 00:48:27.240
two out of sugar.
So that was a very important practical contribution for,

737
00:48:27.241 --> 00:48:30.970
for the present purposes.
He found that when you decompose water,

738
00:48:31.180 --> 00:48:33.760
you get one to one volume of oxygen,

739
00:48:33.761 --> 00:48:37.660
you get 1.9989 volumes of hydrogen.

740
00:48:38.260 --> 00:48:41.620
And if you do the same thing with ammonia for a volume of nitrogen,

741
00:48:41.621 --> 00:48:45.820
you get 3.08163 volumes of hydrogen in his experiments.

742
00:48:45.850 --> 00:48:50.540
What did he conclude?
What was Galen socks?

743
00:48:50.630 --> 00:48:52.350
Conclusion from this page?

744
00:48:52.700 --> 00:48:55.400
What do you think he thought the values would have been if there was no

745
00:48:55.401 --> 00:48:59.810
experimental error?
How much hydrogen,

746
00:48:59.811 --> 00:49:04.100
what do you've got to and how much hydrogen we've gotten from nitrogen?

747
00:49:05.180 --> 00:49:09.260
Three right.
They're very,
very close.
Just a few percent off.
Right.

748
00:49:10.280 --> 00:49:13.790
And even closer in the case of water.
So what did he think?

749
00:49:14.360 --> 00:49:15.193
<v 3>Yeah,</v>

750
00:49:17.440 --> 00:49:22.150
<v 2>he thought the number that the volume of a gas was proportional to the number of</v>

751
00:49:22.151 --> 00:49:26.190
atoms in it.
All right.
Whose name do you associate that with?

752
00:49:26.930 --> 00:49:31.050
I have a god row,
but both of them did it independently.

753
00:49:31.290 --> 00:49:35.730
And gala sock is the one whose data I'm showing here.
Okay.

754
00:49:35.731 --> 00:49:39.300
So this was an alternative to Dalton's law.
Greatest simplicity.

755
00:49:40.170 --> 00:49:44.370
Dalton said if there's only one combat must be one to one Hailu socks.

756
00:49:44.371 --> 00:49:47.250
I'd look up the gas ratios and that turned out to be correct,

757
00:49:48.180 --> 00:49:53.180
although it didn't get completely adopted for another 60 years.

758
00:49:55.350 --> 00:49:58.980
That's really funny.
Okay.
That's enough for now.
