00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.330
 
now a rapid number nine has various

now a rapid number nine has various
 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:18.700
now a rapid number nine has various
levels and particularly at the level

every kind of difficult challenge that
you would want out of any rapid with way

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:28.160
you would want out of any rapid with way

more consequence than 90% of Rapids that

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:30.710
more consequence than 90% of Rapids that
 

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:32.440
more consequence than 90% of Rapids that
are run anywhere in the world

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:32.450
are run anywhere in the world
 

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:34.720
are run anywhere in the world
and so we really need to plan our line

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:34.730
and so we really need to plan our line
 

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:36.820
and so we really need to plan our line
it's not a matter of just floating in

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:36.830
it's not a matter of just floating in

there's distinct maneuvers that have to

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:40.160
there's distinct maneuvers that have to
 

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:41.350
there's distinct maneuvers that have to
be done first of all you have to

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:41.360
be done first of all you have to
 

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:43.720
be done first of all you have to
approach it from exactly the right place

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:43.730
approach it from exactly the right place
 

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:45.760
approach it from exactly the right place
now one thing you must remember when

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:45.770
now one thing you must remember when
 

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:47.020
now one thing you must remember when
you're sitting at water level in your

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:47.030
you're sitting at water level in your
 

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:48.580
you're sitting at water level in your
kayak as you approach a rapid you

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:48.590
kayak as you approach a rapid you
 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:50.800
kayak as you approach a rapid you
actually can't see it is just a horizon

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:50.810
actually can't see it is just a horizon
 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:53.440
actually can't see it is just a horizon
line and so you now you've got to make

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:53.450
line and so you now you've got to make
 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:55.960
line and so you now you've got to make
some sort of guesstimate of where you

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:55.970
some sort of guesstimate of where you
 

00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:58.510
some sort of guesstimate of where you
need to be finally it reveals itself and

00:01:58.510 --> 00:01:58.520
need to be finally it reveals itself and
 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:02.080
need to be finally it reveals itself and
then you start to drop in when you first

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:02.090
then you start to drop in when you first
 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:07.300
then you start to drop in when you first
see that massive rapid number nine it

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:07.310
see that massive rapid number nine it
 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:12.880
see that massive rapid number nine it
puts an immediate smile on your face the

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:12.890

problem with that going from a

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:14.470
problem with that going from a
 

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:18.190
problem with that going from a
constricted zone into a big open sort of

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:18.200
constricted zone into a big open sort of
 

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:21.460
constricted zone into a big open sort of
areas that you seeing massive boils

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:21.470
areas that you seeing massive boils
 

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:25.449
areas that you seeing massive boils
massive whirlpools and randomly breaking

00:02:25.449 --> 00:02:25.459
massive whirlpools and randomly breaking

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:36.790
 
now we were all the way left of the wave

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:36.800
now we were all the way left of the wave
 

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:38.710
now we were all the way left of the wave
train where we really needed to be

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:38.720
train where we really needed to be
