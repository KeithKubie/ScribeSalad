00:00:00.710 --> 00:00:04.570
So the, the pros and cons of,
background subtraction.

00:00:04.570 --> 00:00:05.950
It's very easy to implement.

00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:07.370
It's easy to do in real time,

00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:10.240
fast, and the background models
don't have to be constant.

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:14.130
They can change, so
we could sort of track that change.

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:16.720
The disadvantage,
of course, is, you know,

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:19.770
frame differencing is a real problem,
depending on how things move.

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:22.580
The median background can be
a high memory requirement,

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:24.560
we talked about keeping all that.

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:27.490
And of course, you have to
build a set these thresholds.

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:30.390
When does this basic approach fail?

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:33.933
Well it fails a lot of times when
we can't really touch that, but

00:00:33.933 --> 00:00:38.890
one, one idea that has come up that has
really gotten a lot of play is that,

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:41.640
suppose your background
actually has a couple of

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.220
different things that might be in it,
right?

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:48.948
So, the example that, that I'll show
you in a minute you're looking at,

00:00:48.948 --> 00:00:53.297
water and sometimes it's plain water,
and sometimes it's a specularity.

00:00:53.297 --> 00:00:56.810
Or you might be looking at some areas
where there's some foliage, and

00:00:56.810 --> 00:01:00.735
you might get, you know, one color from
the leaf, and one color from the thing

00:01:00.735 --> 00:01:04.510
that's not so, so these pix, pixels
are essentially in the background.

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:08.874
They're twinkling between a couple
of different values, all right?

00:01:08.874 --> 00:01:13.594
And that analysis was the basis of
a paper that's now very well known by

00:01:13.594 --> 00:01:19.048
Chris Stauer and Eric Grimson on
doing adaptive background modeling.

00:01:19.048 --> 00:01:21.670
And here, they're showing you
a couple different examples.

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:24.500
So we'll just do them,
one is the water here.

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:28.500
And the idea is that the water,
most of the time, it's kind of this dark

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:31.340
color and that's shown as this
distribution as sort of a low value.

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:34.689
This is you can think
of this as an RG space.

00:01:34.689 --> 00:01:38.740
But when they get bright specularities,
you get this high value.

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:43.540
Likewise, this area where the door is,
well when the door is opened,

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:46.030
it's bright because it's light,
it's lit by the,

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:48.350
the, the light in the hall,
in the office.

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:51.800
But when the door is open,
it's much darker and it's over there.

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:55.920
So the idea is that there's
multiple values in the background.

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.425
So what they did was they said okay,

00:01:58.425 --> 00:02:03.520
we're going to model the background
as a mixture of Gaussians.

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:06.520
That is, we're going to say that
the background could be made up

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:11.120
of a couple of different
distributions of intensities, and

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:12.908
we're going to learn
those distributions.

00:02:12.908 --> 00:02:14.750
So if a pixel comes in,

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:18.369
if it comes from one of those Gaussians,
I'll say it's background.

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:23.150
And, if it isn't, if it's new, then
I'm going to say I think that's a new

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:26.730
object, I might hold on to it to
see if it becomes background, but

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:28.610
that's how you do the detection.

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:29.840
One of the cool things about that,

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:33.480
I'll tell you that early on when papers
like this were being done like I said,

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:36.192
people thought background
subtraction was sort of trivial.

00:02:36.192 --> 00:02:40.225
I think this paper is one of the paper
that won the Longuet-Higgins prize for

00:02:40.225 --> 00:02:42.934
being most cited ten years
after it was published,

00:02:42.934 --> 00:02:46.224
because it just became a really
important piece of work.
