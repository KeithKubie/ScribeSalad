00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:05.000
Hey everybody, this is the first viewing of Tom and Jerry and Willy Wonka &amp; the Chocolate Factory.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:11.580
And sadly, the first 15 minutes of footage recorded of this got...uh...damaged when it was being imported.

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:15.600
I looked on the camera, I couldn't salvage it, but...uh...the rest of it is fine.

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:19.300
Uh, so I just want to tell you why that's missing.

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:22.900
And...uh...you might be wondering why my dad is in this viewing?

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:24.800
Uh, he just wanted to see it.

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:25.700
He likes Tom and Jerry

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:26.900
he likes Willy Wonka

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:28.600
he kind of knew he wasn't going to like this

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:30.000
but he just wanted to witness it.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.700
So we welcomed him aboard to make some comments with us.

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:38.500
So that's what he's doing here, and...uh...it was an interesting one to sit there to say the least.

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:40.140
So go ahead and enjoy.

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:50.880
"What's going on out there!?"

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:56.180
That kid was just waiting for him to come to the door like "C'mon! C'mon! The chocolate!"

00:00:56.260 --> 00:01:01.960
The kid moves like Sonic! Everything! I! Do! Is! Cool! Look at this! Woah!

00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:04.680
Wah!

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:09.400
The fuck?! David Lynch can make a movie out of all these faces.

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:12.160
No, that's the element Wonkonium.

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:14.020
(laughter)

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:15.040
God.

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:17.760
Man, they even got that shot.

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:18.260
Yeah.

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:20.889
"This is going to cost Wonka a fortune in chocolate."

00:01:21.009 --> 00:01:24.400
They're already stereotypes in the live-action version,

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:28.160
now, just throw animation on top of it, it just looks even more insulting!

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:30.800
Even the Americans kinda look 
like American stereotypes!

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:33.000
That's been the easiest movie to write.

00:01:33.009 --> 00:01:39.160
Just like "Tom and Jerry do stuff. RIP RIP from original Script. Tom &amp; Jerry do stuff. RIP RIP."

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:40.760
"I've never been happier."

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:43.140
- Now, that's good. 
- THAT'S funny

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:45.360
Fucking Droopy, man. I always knew that guy was an asshole.

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:51.600
Class, let's discuss how a dog can win a golden ticket and how they can work in a candy factory.

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:56.300
Let's discuss how I'm going to take it out on you by giving you all unnecessary Fs

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:59.820
Now there going to argue who gets to eat the coin.

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:01.340
What the hell is that!?

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:03.540
Wha- What was that?

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:05.580
The Fast and The Furriest.

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:07.900
"-has just been taking into custody by the police."

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:09.860
"Ay caramba."

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:12.320
(laughter)

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:18.580
Who knew Droopy was a criminal mastermind. I never thought I'd see the day where Droopy would be in cuffs.

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:21.860
(As Droopy)I guess I'm already the jail bitch.

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:23.380
Judge Claude Frollo!

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:25.840
Bring these vermin to the taffy waffy room.

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:29.400
Do you think the animators were just trolling?

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:34.160
You know, we're so bored with this idea, like let's at least have fun with us.

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:35.560
(Slugworth starts singing) "I want it all"

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:37.500
Umm...

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:40.980
What's going on?

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:43.060
I am a dark wizard!

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:46.380
Did you give the other kids this song? 'Cause it looked like just a whisper.

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:49.420
I never imagined Slugworth singing.

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:54.040
It's like if Pink Elephants (Dumbo) and Hellfire (Hunchback of Notre Dame) made this horrible combination.

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:56.420
"Oh yeah, I'm fine, Charlie. I'm fine."

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:57.780
"Look at me!"

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:03.340
That was a great segue. "I'm fine Charlie- LOOK AT ME!"

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:05.560
"LOOK! AT! ME!"

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:09.220
If you haven't seen Willy Wonka at all, does this work at all?

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:11.000
Of course not.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:16.740
But, look at it this way. If you've seen Tom and Jerry, it still doesn't work. "Cause you just want to see Tom and Jerry.

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:20.660
Oh no, man. The chamber pot right on top.

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:23.220
That's a shitty thing to do.

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:25.420
"October First. That's tomorrow!"

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:26.940
I'm running over here.

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:29.440
Just like the real movie. It's like:

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:32.860
I've served my purpose raising this child I get no reward. The end.

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:33.520
"Bye."

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:35.400
She looked really interested in that bye.

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:40.280
Every face looks like the last face you see before that person eats you.

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:45.860
Welcome, my friends. Welcome. Today is going to be such an exciting day. It's a computer

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:46.820
Is he a computer!?

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:47.740
Yeah.

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:53.260
I. have. been. programmed. to. say. things. Welcome. Char. lie.

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:56.220
Oh My God! What!? Wha-

00:03:56.220 --> 00:04:00.800
I've got pink eye and a lazy eye. I've got a lazy pink eye and a sty.

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:06.760
"What do you get when your glass eye is cracked? Looking like you're having a heart attack"

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:09.220
OH NO NO NO! STOP! STOP!

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:12.860
OOHH Oh oh. That's... not what I thought it was.

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:14.820
Wow...

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:18.740
"Charlie Bucket will get exactly what's coming to him? (evil laugh)"

00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:22.620
I love it when I say plans that are really nice in an evil way.

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:28.240
We're going to give money to the children at the hospital. (evil laugh)

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:32.420
Fuck them all. They will be so happy! (more evil laughter)

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:37.980
I hope they see the oompa-loompa queen. She's someone that squeezes out all the oompa-loompas.

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:39.540
You people don't know about that.

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:41.860
We fell in the septic tank!

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:45.000
You're just the right size to fit in my oven.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:49.580
Really, all Willy Wonka is, is a Hanzel and Gretel story where the witch wins.

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:51.920
And recruits a new witch.

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:57.500
The Willy Wonka story, which we know so well, they haven't changed anything.

00:04:57.500 --> 00:05:02.780
It's really ironic too; him singing this song about pure imagination and changing the world,

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:05.180
when this is the most unoriginal fucking thing on the planet.

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:05.680
Yeah.

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:08.920
"What do you get- (Rob interrupts) with a lame old rehash?"

00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:11.680
"Just one giant pile of ass"

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:17.880
The movie has the time to play up all of these characters faults, this still seems a little out of view; like

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:20.200
"Yeah I guess the kid was fat. Death!"

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:23.180
(laughter)

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:25.380
In the movie it's like every second he's eating.

00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:29.100
There's so little time spent with these kids so far. And it's like "Wow, a bunch of assholes".

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:32.220
Oh my God. Are they going to do the Tunnel?

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:37.020
I have to see how Tom and Jerry Willy Wonka do the tunnel!

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:40.400
Display all of the racially inappropriate Tom and Jerry things in the past.

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:44.080
(laughter) All the Blackface!

00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:46.940
Oh, come on. This is Rainbow Road on Mario kart.

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:47.460
Yeah.

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:50.860
"There's no earthy way of knowing..."

00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:52.380
R-really?

00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:55.760
"There's no knowing where we're rowing..."

00:05:56.880 --> 00:05:59.220
This is strangely more nonsensical than it was in the first film.

00:05:59.220 --> 00:05:59.720
Yeah.

00:05:59.940 --> 00:06:01.260
"Not a speck of light is showing-"

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:02.420
What the fuck!?

00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:04.240
(insane screaming)

00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:06.240
(laughing in fear)

00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:08.480
Wow.

00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:11.220
Umm... That was not what I was expecting.

00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:15.700
I- I'm not gonna lie I think I may have just found that creepier than the-

00:06:15.700 --> 00:06:16.760
I might have too.

00:06:16.980 --> 00:06:18.580
"It's sticky as all get out."

00:06:18.580 --> 00:06:20.840
Kid, I'm not listening to a thing you're saying now.

00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:22.220
You just scared the shit out of me.

00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:23.640
You've... you've lost that right.

00:06:23.880 --> 00:06:26.060
Okay, that banana is- Oh my God.

00:06:26.220 --> 00:06:27.360
Oh wow.

00:06:27.480 --> 00:06:28.200
Holy shit.

00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:30.200
That's Little Mermaid poster bad.

00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:32.180
Yeah. That- Oh damn.

00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:37.180
EWWW It's touching his head! Oh my god!

00:06:37.180 --> 00:06:39.940
If he licks the banana, I swear to God.

00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:45.860
Instead of, like, make it look like there's a light on her, couldn't they make her really blue? It's a cartoon.

00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:47.960
Like, really go for the fun colors.

00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:49.660
They don't even have her big enough.

00:06:49.780 --> 00:06:52.620
Yeah. They just stab her a thousand times.

00:06:52.620 --> 00:06:54.280
Oompa-loom- *stab stab stab*

00:06:56.620 --> 00:06:59.860
How fascinating. I'm like "How does this movie feel slower than the original?". it's not even an hour and a half

00:06:59.860 --> 00:07:03.680
It's not even an hour and a half. It's like... Oh my God when is this gonna end?

00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:06.740
You're just making the fan go faster in the fizzy lifting drink room.

00:07:07.440 --> 00:07:09.880
You just launched the missiles towards China!

00:07:10.320 --> 00:07:14.000
Wouldn't it be amazing... if he gives Charlie the factory,

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:16.700
but then it's revealed all the shit they've been doing this Slugworth. That's the fellow employee of mine

00:07:16.700 --> 00:07:18.260
That's a fellow employee of mine!

00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:20.120
You know what? You don't get shit Charlie.

00:07:20.120 --> 00:07:23.920
Why are there spikes all up in there? What the fuck?

00:07:23.920 --> 00:07:26.600
You know, if there's any chocolate factory that would have them.

00:07:26.600 --> 00:07:28.900
Can we whip out the fucking paranoia song, again?

00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:33.440
Paranoia, Paranoia, everybody's coming to get me

00:07:33.880 --> 00:07:35.520
Oh, it's level 5 on Mario World.

00:07:37.960 --> 00:07:39.440
"I want the world"

00:07:39.480 --> 00:07:40.500
WE JUST DID THIS!

00:07:40.600 --> 00:07:41.960
WHAT THE FUCK!?

00:07:42.280 --> 00:07:43.940
"I want today"

00:07:44.320 --> 00:07:45.680
Everyone: Ooooohhh

00:07:45.960 --> 00:07:48.220
Now, we've established a connection.

00:07:48.220 --> 00:07:51.900
This connects as much as... Tom and Jerry in a Willy Wonka movie!

00:07:52.200 --> 00:07:54.040
I wonder if Han Solo is in there.

00:07:54.040 --> 00:07:56.440
I was gonna say. "Get down, Chewy. I don't care what you smell."

00:07:56.940 --> 00:07:58.260
Holy shit.

00:07:58.260 --> 00:07:59.380
And they're gonna burn them.

00:07:59.400 --> 00:08:00.720
OH MY GOD!!!

00:08:00.720 --> 00:08:02.440
We're going Toy Story 3 up in here!

00:08:02.880 --> 00:08:04.660
"Wonkavision! My latest-"

00:08:04.700 --> 00:08:07.540
And, Thank God, last creation on the tour.

00:08:07.540 --> 00:08:12.100
I'm gonna take a wild guess and say this is gonna make even less sense in the animated version.

00:08:12.480 --> 00:08:14.500
"Can you send people through this thing?"

00:08:14.500 --> 00:08:16.960
Wonkavision is people!

00:08:17.120 --> 00:08:19.280
"Or could just not bare to look?"

00:08:20.140 --> 00:08:22.340
(laughter) It chopped in half, apparently.

00:08:22.340 --> 00:08:24.480
We actually had more to that routine.

00:08:24.480 --> 00:08:28.500
I don't care how long you practiced, you're on the clock. Now get back to work.

00:08:28.500 --> 00:08:32.300
"Now, you will pay the price for interfering with my master plan."

00:08:32.380 --> 00:08:34.580
What is happening right now?

00:08:34.580 --> 00:08:37.340
What do you get when you don't know when to stop?

00:08:37.480 --> 00:08:40.420
Gotta pad this thing out so it's not quite a flop

00:08:40.820 --> 00:08:44.540
Well, I'll give it this. I was not predicting this is how it end.

00:08:44.900 --> 00:08:48.040
Boy, they sure took a sideways look at this thing.

00:08:48.180 --> 00:08:50.060
(laughter)

00:08:50.720 --> 00:08:51.880
That's one way of putting it.

00:08:51.880 --> 00:08:55.340
"Under Section 37 of the contract, signed by him,-"

00:08:55.340 --> 00:08:56.680
Which we DID NOT show.

00:08:56.680 --> 00:08:59.160
You didn't even put the plot point in th-

00:08:59.260 --> 00:09:01.320
(rage quit)

00:09:01.320 --> 00:09:04.160
That's right. They fight. I forgot about that.

00:09:04.280 --> 00:09:05.079
Oh, yeah.

00:09:05.840 --> 00:09:08.780
"Yes, and I've press them. All except for one."

00:09:08.920 --> 00:09:10.820
The one that says "annihilate"?

00:09:10.980 --> 00:09:13.000
Go on, Charlie. Press it.

00:09:13.880 --> 00:09:14.760
"Whoa"

00:09:14.760 --> 00:09:16.000
"It's begun Charlie."

00:09:16.400 --> 00:09:18.300
(laughter)

00:09:18.380 --> 00:09:20.380
That would have been the greatest ending in the movie.

00:09:21.180 --> 00:09:24.220
"It's begun", and then just end. Black screen.

00:09:24.720 --> 00:09:26.900
So Charlie, how did you like my factory?

00:09:27.140 --> 00:09:29.520
I'd fight to give it a star on Yelp.

00:09:31.440 --> 00:09:34.340
Oh, they got the Tom and Jerry The End? Ugh!

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:37.280
In some ways it was not as bad as I thought it was,

00:09:37.300 --> 00:09:43.140
but, that's also what made it worse. Because, it was not even so bad, it's like memorable rage-worthy bad.

00:09:43.140 --> 00:09:45.580
It just bored the living shit out of me.

00:09:45.580 --> 00:09:48.360
It had one or two good slapstick moments. I'll give it that.

00:09:48.400 --> 00:09:51.240
It's a little funny how bad it is at times.

00:09:51.240 --> 00:09:52.600
Like the awkward drawings.

00:09:52.600 --> 00:09:55.420
It's like, I wanted even more funny bad.

00:09:55.420 --> 00:09:58.440
Yeah, when it just gets to the repeat, that is really boring.

00:09:58.440 --> 00:10:03.500
I absolutely love Willy Wonka and I love Tom and Jerry,

00:10:03.600 --> 00:10:08.240
and to see them force these two things together,

00:10:08.240 --> 00:10:14.640
and crunch them, and put them through the trash compactor and come up with even more shit. That's funny

00:10:14.740 --> 00:10:16.740
That's about it. We'll see you next time. Bye.

00:10:17.340 --> 00:10:18.760
Let's watch something good now.

00:10:18.960 --> 00:10:19.900
NEVER!!!

00:10:27.620 --> 00:10:29.620
you
