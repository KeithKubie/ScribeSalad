PURNIMA KOCHIKAR:
Good evening and

welcome to the second
annual Google Play Awards.

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:07.960
We launched these

to celebrate your amazing work.

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:14.560
Behind every great app
is a creative vision

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:16.490
and a remarkable team.

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:23.230
Today we celebrate you,
your vision, and your teams.

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:25.330
It's a privilege
for us at Google

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:28.150
to be part of your amazing work.

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:32.200
You build beautiful apps,
successful businesses,

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:37.100
and touch lives of
people around the world.

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:41.260
And you challenge us to
innovate on our platforms

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:45.790
and keep pace with
your imagination.

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:49.840
I couldn't be more excited about
the diversity of the nominees

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:52.510
in today's categories.

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:55.090
From apps that
teach kids to code,

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:59.560
to ones that allow you to play
with friends around the world.

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:02.970
From fintech to
feeding the hungry,

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:05.950
it is amazing to see the
many different countries you

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:09.280
come from and the many,
many different apps that you

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:09.850
are building.

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:17.010
And, as where I stand,
it is exciting for me

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:22.560
to also see all the wonderful
things that connect you.

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:27.300
You have a relentless
focus on your users,

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:30.420
innovation hunger to pick
up the latest features

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:33.720
and capabilities,
and a dedication

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:36.225
to build beautiful
apps that engage.

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:44.550
In looking at your apps,
the judging panel of course

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:48.390
took into account
innovation and design,

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:52.980
but also thought about things
like app quality that actually

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:57.570
lead to user happiness, things
like does your app drain

00:03:57.570 --> 00:03:59.130
battery.

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:02.770
None of us likes that, do we?

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:07.190
And judging by the ratings
and reviews on Google Play,

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:11.200
we are sure that our
users and your users

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:15.730
agree that your apps
exemplify the best that

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:18.519
is there in Android and Play.

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:23.185
So with no further ado,
let's get the show started.

00:04:23.185 --> 00:04:25.400

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:52.460
ANNOUNCER: Standout Indie.

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:59.510
Please welcome Jamil Moledina,
games strategic lead,

00:04:59.510 --> 00:05:00.380
Google Play.

00:05:09.564 --> 00:05:11.480
JAMIL MOLEDINA: Right
before coming to Google,

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:14.660
I ran an indie game startup.

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:17.420
I learned first hand
how risky innovation

00:05:17.420 --> 00:05:19.400
is for a small studio.

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:21.900
But at the same
time, innovation may

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:25.040
be all you have to stand out.

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:28.220
It's then incumbent
upon platforms

00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:30.860
to shine a spotlight on
those developers that

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:33.830
dare to try something new.

00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:36.470
And helping operate
that spotlight at Google

00:05:36.470 --> 00:05:38.990
is one way that I've
been able to give back

00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:42.950
to this rich, diverse community.

00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:45.980
Indies have inherent
value in that

00:05:45.980 --> 00:05:48.170
they demonstrate the
endless capabilities of what

00:05:48.170 --> 00:05:51.170
small teams can build.

00:05:51.170 --> 00:05:55.100
They pour their hearts
and souls into their work.

00:05:55.100 --> 00:05:56.750
They embody diversity.

00:05:56.750 --> 00:05:59.690
And often they take
unexpected leaps,

00:05:59.690 --> 00:06:03.260
introducing us to unique game
controls and breakthrough story

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:07.940
ideas, all stemming from a
deep passion for their art

00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:12.500
while using games as a medium
to express the human condition.

00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:16.310
This year's nominees
deliver on all counts.

00:06:16.310 --> 00:06:17.060

is the epitome of a beautiful
game experience on mobile.

00:07:07.410 --> 00:07:10.860
It's stunning graphics,
melancholic soundtrack,

00:07:10.860 --> 00:07:14.040
and unique and
native game controls,

00:07:14.040 --> 00:07:17.400
give gamers the perfect
immersion into the challenges

00:07:17.400 --> 00:07:20.640
and outcomes of this world.

00:07:20.640 --> 00:07:23.940
I fell in love the first time
I played the early version

00:07:23.940 --> 00:07:26.460
of this game and I'm
thrilled that we can share it

00:07:26.460 --> 00:07:29.040
with everyone on Google Play.

00:07:29.040 --> 00:07:31.320

Head of Apps Business

00:08:31.045 --> 00:08:32.669
LARISSA FONTAINE:
Like indies, startups

00:08:32.669 --> 00:08:36.600
are all about taking risks
and fueling innovation.

00:08:36.600 --> 00:08:39.630
Small and scrappy, the
most exciting startups

00:08:39.630 --> 00:08:44.400
inspire all of us by
taking great ideas

00:08:44.400 --> 00:08:47.660
and turning them into
breakout success stories.

00:08:47.660 --> 00:08:49.710
At Play, we care a
lot about making sure

00:08:49.710 --> 00:08:52.320
that startups can
find their audience

00:08:52.320 --> 00:08:56.220
and that users can find the
great and exciting apps that

00:08:56.220 --> 00:08:59.050
are coming from this community.

00:08:59.050 --> 00:09:01.680
In addition to innovating
inside their own apps,

00:09:01.680 --> 00:09:05.010
startups are often early
adopters of new platforms

00:09:05.010 --> 00:09:07.350
and new technology
features, which

00:09:07.350 --> 00:09:09.990
means they're creating some of
the most interesting Android

00:09:09.990 --> 00:09:13.560
experiences today and they're
also becoming some of our best

00:09:13.560 --> 00:09:15.300
partners.

00:09:15.300 --> 00:09:17.314
So now that we've set
that bar really high,

00:09:17.314 --> 00:09:18.730

00:10:08.350 --> 00:10:11.140
for the texting generation.

00:10:11.140 --> 00:10:13.420
They use an everyday
mobile behavior

00:10:13.420 --> 00:10:16.780
to deliver creative and
captivating stories that

00:10:16.780 --> 00:10:20.430
immerse the user in the
narrative in real time.

00:10:20.430 --> 00:10:22.420

00:11:50.060 --> 00:11:52.160
DAVID SINGLETON: Android
Wear enables developers

00:11:52.160 --> 00:11:55.970
to reach users with glanceable
information throughout the day.

00:11:55.970 --> 00:11:58.520
And with Wear 2.0, which
is our latest release,

00:11:58.520 --> 00:12:01.430
we introduced standalone apps.

00:12:01.430 --> 00:12:03.590
These allow you to
build experiences

00:12:03.590 --> 00:12:07.100
that operate independently
without necessarily requiring

00:12:07.100 --> 00:12:08.870
the phone nearby.

00:12:08.870 --> 00:12:11.630
The new apps being
created help simplify

00:12:11.630 --> 00:12:15.650
life's daily activities, such
as staying informed, exploring

00:12:15.650 --> 00:12:18.710
what's nearby, and
accessing guides and metrics

00:12:18.710 --> 00:12:22.460
to improve your personal
health and workout routines.

00:12:22.460 --> 00:12:25.550
And while Android Wear is still
a platform in its infancy,

00:12:25.550 --> 00:12:29.270
we are so excited by the
support from both developers

00:12:29.270 --> 00:12:32.220
and hardware manufacturers
and I hope more of you

00:12:32.220 --> 00:12:33.490
will try it on.

SASCHA PRUETER: I really
need a new stock photo.

00:14:22.700 --> 00:14:24.700
So while many mobile
developers build

00:14:24.700 --> 00:14:27.680
for small screen, such as
Android Wear just presented,

00:14:27.680 --> 00:14:29.720
this category
celebrates those who

00:14:29.720 --> 00:14:31.880
reach audiences
through Android TV

00:14:31.880 --> 00:14:36.500
and take advantage of the
largest screen in the house.

00:14:36.500 --> 00:14:39.020
Building for the large
screen allows developers

00:14:39.020 --> 00:14:43.550
to explore new menu and UI
options, create rich media

00:14:43.550 --> 00:14:47.180
experiences that drive
real long session times.

00:14:47.180 --> 00:14:51.020
And thanks to a strong developer
community-- so thanks to you--

00:14:51.020 --> 00:14:53.420
the TV apps section
is fast growing

00:14:53.420 --> 00:14:54.980
and a successful category.

00:14:54.980 --> 00:14:58.250
The number of TV apps

00:14:58.250 --> 00:15:00.440

CLAY BAVOR: So, VR is cool
because it can, like that guy,

00:17:31.360 --> 00:17:34.190
really make you feel like
you're somewhere else.

00:17:34.190 --> 00:17:36.970
Whether you're on a beach
with scary crab zombies

00:17:36.970 --> 00:17:41.080
or searching an ancient
shipwreck for VR treasure,

00:17:41.080 --> 00:17:43.390
it really puts you
right in the action.

00:17:43.390 --> 00:17:45.520
And you don't just
get to see what

00:17:45.520 --> 00:17:48.100
it's like to be somewhere
else, but really experience it.

00:17:48.100 --> 00:17:51.190
So Daydream is our platform
for mobile virtual reality.

00:17:51.190 --> 00:17:53.710

00:17:53.710 --> 00:17:56.080

you can step inside
games, you can just

00:18:06.910 --> 00:18:09.670
kick back and watch your
own personal cinema.

00:18:09.670 --> 00:18:12.430

it's hard to describe
the kind of crazy,

00:19:06.770 --> 00:19:09.800
off the wall
experience of exploring

00:19:09.800 --> 00:19:14.120
50 different alternate realities
doing weird jobs for bored

00:19:14.120 --> 00:19:16.310
artificial intelligences,
all while trying

00:19:16.310 --> 00:19:20.350
to uncover the back story
of the shady company

00:19:20.350 --> 00:19:24.500
Activitude, the virtual
labor system of the future.

00:19:24.500 --> 00:19:26.160
You just have to try it.

00:19:26.160 --> 00:19:28.610
The winner of this
year's best VR experience

00:19:28.610 --> 00:19:31.265

AMIT SINGH: Hello everybody.

00:20:22.020 --> 00:20:24.390
Just like Clay
was talking about,

00:20:24.390 --> 00:20:27.120
Virtual reality can
take you anywhere.

00:20:27.120 --> 00:20:31.830
Augmented Reality, AR,
can bring anything to you

00:20:31.830 --> 00:20:34.110
as if it was there.

00:20:34.110 --> 00:20:37.110
And we've been
working on a project

00:20:37.110 --> 00:20:39.240
for a while called Tango.

00:20:39.240 --> 00:20:44.580
It allows phones to
sense just like we do,

00:20:44.580 --> 00:20:47.900
depth, scale,
perception, precision.

00:20:47.900 --> 00:20:52.440
It can really bring objects
as if they were right there.

00:20:52.440 --> 00:20:56.100
And people have done
amazing things with it.

00:20:56.100 --> 00:20:59.160
You can shop for
a couch, make sure

00:20:59.160 --> 00:21:03.510
it fits the environment you're
in, or you can invite dinosaurs

00:21:03.510 --> 00:21:05.817
and play with them
in your kitchen.

00:21:05.817 --> 00:21:07.650
And so let's take a
look at the nominees who

00:21:07.650 --> 00:21:11.090

00:21:59.600 --> 00:22:02.300
They're all actually
in the pod over there

00:22:02.300 --> 00:22:04.930
with the Daydream

00:22:04.930 --> 00:22:08.210

whimsical fanciness,

00:22:12.410 --> 00:22:15.740
and decorate the world,
and it's just fun.

00:22:15.740 --> 00:22:18.440
Hard to describe but
super fun to play.

00:22:18.440 --> 00:22:21.015
And the winner is

00:22:21.015 --> 00:22:22.924

ANNOUNCER: Best app for kids.

00:23:21.260 --> 00:23:25.880
Please welcome Shazia Makhdumi,
Global Head of Education

00:23:25.880 --> 00:23:28.321
and Family Partnerships

00:23:33.231 --> 00:23:34.790
SHAZIA MAKHDUMI: Hi everyone.

00:23:34.790 --> 00:23:38.710
So as the mom of two
boys, aged 9 and 10,

00:23:38.710 --> 00:23:41.170
and who are captivated
by worlds of "Harry

00:23:41.170 --> 00:23:45.580
Potter" and "Minecraft," I
love how great apps and games

00:23:45.580 --> 00:23:49.810
can capture kids imagination
and fire their creativity.

00:23:49.810 --> 00:23:53.890
But in addition, the right
apps also go beyond that.

00:23:53.890 --> 00:23:58.030
They help change parents'
perception of mobile devices

00:23:58.030 --> 00:24:01.330
beyond electronic
babysitters to tools

00:24:01.330 --> 00:24:03.280
that help their
kids develop skills,

00:24:03.280 --> 00:24:06.760
to explore, to
thrive, and to learn.

00:24:06.760 --> 00:24:09.220
Now if only someone could
build an app that keeps

00:24:09.220 --> 00:24:12.520
my kids that same age forever.

00:24:12.520 --> 00:24:15.340
However, developers in our
design for families program,

00:24:15.340 --> 00:24:17.920
while they don't
do that, they use

00:24:17.920 --> 00:24:19.960
intuitive and kid
friendly design

00:24:19.960 --> 00:24:22.360
together with age
appropriate content

00:24:22.360 --> 00:24:24.310
to engage and inspire kids.

00:24:24.310 --> 00:24:27.370
With colorful characters,
creative visuals,

00:24:27.370 --> 00:24:31.810
realistic sounds, they
build fun, educational,

00:24:31.810 --> 00:24:35.180
and safe experiences
on mobile devices.

00:24:35.180 --> 00:24:38.640
So this year's nominees
offer a diverse lineup

00:24:38.640 --> 00:24:42.040
sure to appeal to any
household with kids.

00:24:42.040 --> 00:24:42.820

00:25:24.354 --> 00:25:25.770
SHAZIA MAKHDUMI:
So just like it's

00:25:25.770 --> 00:25:27.570
really hard as any
parent would know

00:25:27.570 --> 00:25:31.350
to pick your favorite
child, you know

00:25:31.350 --> 00:25:33.360
we've had to make a
choice here though--

00:25:33.360 --> 00:25:34.530
love them all.

00:25:34.530 --> 00:25:37.080
But can you imagine
anything more fun

00:25:37.080 --> 00:25:40.230
than showing off your
style with characters

00:25:40.230 --> 00:25:43.110
that express the real you.

00:25:43.110 --> 00:25:45.600
This year's winner
teaches kids how

00:25:45.600 --> 00:25:50.310
to use their creativity to
build, explore, and share,

00:25:50.310 --> 00:25:52.800
all while learning
about science.

00:25:52.800 --> 00:25:55.410

Developer Product Group.

00:26:38.150 --> 00:26:40.700
JASON TITUS: So
one of the greatest

00:26:40.700 --> 00:26:44.600
things about mobile phones is
how they let us play together

00:26:44.600 --> 00:26:48.110
across continents and take
time, whether it's a line

00:26:48.110 --> 00:26:50.780
or on the bus, and
actually make it

00:26:50.780 --> 00:26:53.600
time playing with your friends.

00:26:53.600 --> 00:26:56.990
In recent years we've
seen amazing improvements

00:26:56.990 --> 00:26:59.360
with multiplayer
games taking advantage

00:26:59.360 --> 00:27:02.030
of the huge numbers
of mobile users

00:27:02.030 --> 00:27:06.830
as well as the advanced
technology in today's phones.

00:27:06.830 --> 00:27:10.040
Multiplayer games come
in all genres and sizes,

00:27:10.040 --> 00:27:11.630
but the thing that
they have in common

00:27:11.630 --> 00:27:14.960
is their amazing ability
to bring us together.

00:27:14.960 --> 00:27:18.020
A true multiplayer game is
built from the ground up,

00:27:18.020 --> 00:27:20.120

It's developed by a team of 30
different nationalities, which

00:28:13.030 --> 00:28:15.450
seems so appropriate.

00:28:15.450 --> 00:28:17.800
To the developers continual
push for excellence

00:28:17.800 --> 00:28:20.180

It's great to have

00:29:15.100 --> 00:29:18.070
It's amazing to think about
the innovation in mobile apps

00:29:18.070 --> 00:29:19.090
over the past few years.

00:29:19.090 --> 00:29:21.520
We've seen so many
great examples of that

00:29:21.520 --> 00:29:23.170
already tonight.

00:29:23.170 --> 00:29:26.020
As smartphones have
become more powerful,

00:29:26.020 --> 00:29:28.270
you all have kept pace
by finding more ways

00:29:28.270 --> 00:29:31.450
for our phones to help
us in our daily lives.

00:29:31.450 --> 00:29:34.540
Great apps help us
create, explore, stay

00:29:34.540 --> 00:29:37.970
fit, organize, learn,
and so much more.

00:29:37.970 --> 00:29:40.570

in design and performance,
thoughtful use

00:29:43.570 --> 00:29:45.850
of the capabilities
of our devices,

00:29:45.850 --> 00:29:47.720

This app takes an activity
that can be a drag and makes it

00:30:37.210 --> 00:30:39.100
a ton of fun.

00:30:39.100 --> 00:30:41.615

developers have the

00:34:50.060 --> 00:34:54.190
Android, Google Play, we
would be nowhere without you.

00:34:54.190 --> 00:34:56.247
So a big thank you to
the developer community.

00:34:56.247 --> 00:34:57.080

00:35:01.810 --> 00:35:02.500
All right.

00:35:02.500 --> 00:35:05.290

make it universally

00:35:06.970 --> 00:35:10.642

Universally accessible.

00:35:10.642 --> 00:35:12.850
