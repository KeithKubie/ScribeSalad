00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:38.250
Make sure you tell the truth though, as we're

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:40.129
of Screen Rant's Ultimate Movie Quiz.

00:00:40.129 --> 00:00:43.370
Back to the Future
The brilliant Back to the Future featured,

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:47.489
amongst other things, a dog called Einstein,
a time-travelling De-Lorean and a padded,

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:54.420
burnt orange down vest, but which related
real-life figure did writers Robert Zemeckis

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:57.780
and Bob Gale receive a letter from after he
saw the movie?

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:01.309
A - Bernhard Caesar Einstein, Grandson of
Albert Einstein

00:01:01.309 --> 00:01:04.629
B - John DeLorean, Founder of DeLorean Motor
Company

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:10.360
C - Eddie Bauer, Inventor of the Down Vest
(Screen lights up B)

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:14.090
The writers of Back to the Future actually
received a fan letter from John DeLorean - the

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:18.010
man whose company made the DeLorean car that
was featured in the movie - after it was released,

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:21.860
thanking them for immortalising his car.

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:27.250
Titanic
The production of the 1997 epic Titanic involved

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:31.080
creating a lifesized model of the original
ship, using blueprints provided by the original

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:34.630
builder, but what happened to it after the
movie was filmed?

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:38.880
A - The cast and crew bought it between themselves
B - It was placed In a maritime museum in

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.160
Asia
C - It was sold as scrap metal

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:45.100
(Screen lights up C)
Rather unfortunately, after filming on the

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:49.820
Titanic movie had wrapped, the remains of
the full-size set were sold off as scrap metal.

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:52.740
Taken
Liam Neeson has made the role of Bryan Mills

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:56.560
a fairly iconic one in the Taken series of
movies, but he wasn't the first choice for

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:57.700
the role in the first movie.

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:00.840
Which veteran actor was originally cast as
the former CIA agent?

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:02.910
A - Kurt Russell
B - Jeff Bridges

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:05.900
C - Michael Biehn
(Screen lights up B)

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:17.260
The Big Lebowski star Jeff Bridges was first
cast as Bryan Mills in Taken but, after he

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:21.159
dropped out of the project, Liam Neeson accepted
the part, citing how he wanted to play a more

00:02:21.159 --> 00:02:24.459
physically demanding role than the ones he
was used to.

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:28.930
Doctor Strange
Doctor Strange will star British actor Benedict

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:30.340
Cumberbatch in the titular role.

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:34.600
He is probably most well-known for playing
Sherlock Holmes in the BBC series Sherlock,

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:38.550
but how many other Holmes actors have appeared
in live action adaptations based on Marvel

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:39.550
properties?

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:42.160
A - 3
B – 4

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:48.599
C - 5
(Screen lights up B)

00:02:48.599 --> 00:02:52.269
Four actors who have previously played Sherlock
Holmes on screen have gone on to appear in

00:02:52.269 --> 00:02:54.010
live action Marvel productions.

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:57.879
Christopher Lee, Jeremy Brett, Robert Downey,
Jr. and Ian McKellen have appeared in Captain

00:02:57.879 --> 00:03:01.959
America II: Death Too Soon, an episode of
The Incredible Hulk, the Marvel Cinematic

00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:04.079
Universe and the X-Men movie franchise respectively.

00:03:04.079 --> 00:03:07.410
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story represents the

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:12.270
second Hollywood collaboration between director
Gareth Edwards and composer Alexandre Desplat.

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:14.469
But which movie did they work on together
first?

00:03:14.469 --> 00:03:17.290
A - Hiroshima
B - Monsters

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:20.629
C - Godzilla
(Screen lights up C)

00:03:20.629 --> 00:03:25.340
It was actually the reboot of Godzilla back
in 2014 that was last both directed by Gareth

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:27.659
Edwards and composed by Alexandre Desplat.

00:03:27.659 --> 00:03:32.250
Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them
The movie version of J.K.

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:35.989
Rowling's Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find
Them will use a case from real world history

00:03:35.989 --> 00:03:39.230
to emphasise why magic users in the movie
are scared to make themselves known to the

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:40.639
rest of the world.

00:03:40.639 --> 00:03:41.780
Which case will that be?

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:45.040
A - The Salem Witch Trials
B - The Witches of Belvoir Case

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:50.180
C - The Pappenheimer Family Case
(Screen lights up A)

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:54.860
The most famous case of real world people
being punished for alleged witchcraft - the

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:59.239
Salem Witch Trials - will be heavily referred
to in Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them.

00:03:59.239 --> 00:04:02.590
They will be cited as the reason that magic
users are worried about revealing themselves.

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:06.329
The Incredible Hulk
In 2008's The Incredible Hulk, William Hurt's

00:04:06.329 --> 00:04:11.109
General Ross relentlessly pursued the titular
character, but which other fictional character

00:04:11.109 --> 00:04:12.519
did Hurt base his performance on?

00:04:12.519 --> 00:04:15.340
A - Captain Ahab
B - Harry Callahan

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:20.269
C - Sir Guy of Gisbourne
(Screen lights up A)

00:04:20.269 --> 00:04:24.830
William Hurt claimed that he based his performance
as General Ross on Captain Ahab, the obsessive

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:27.780
captain who relentlessly chased the titular
whale in the classic Moby Dick story.

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:30.550
Halloween
For years after John Carpenter's horror classic

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:34.110
Halloween was released, people would tell
the director how horrified they were by Michael

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:37.321
Myers' horribly disfigured face when his mask
was briefly removed in the movie.

00:04:37.321 --> 00:04:38.860
Why was this a little strange?

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:43.000
A - He had his back to the camera at the time
B - He covered his face before it was even

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:46.100
revealed
C - It was the normal face of actor Tony Moran

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:52.220
(Screen lights up C)
All those people saw was the ordinary face

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:53.690
of the actor Tony Moran.

00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:57.280
It was perfectly normal, except for a small
knife wound inflicted by Laurie during their

00:04:57.280 --> 00:05:01.970
struggle in the closet, which was created
using special effects makeup.

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:06.620
Carpenter cites the power of suggestion of
cinema as the reason for their horror.

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:10.980
Troy
For their epic duel in 2004's Troy, Brad Pitt

00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:12.850
and Eric Bana didn't use stunt doubles.

00:05:12.850 --> 00:05:16.741
Instead, they made a gentlemen's agreement
to pay for every accidental hit - $50 for

00:05:16.741 --> 00:05:19.400
each light blow and $100 for each hard blow.

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:20.910
How much did they end up paying each other?

00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:25.220
A - Pitt paid Bana $750, Bana didn't owe Pitt
anything

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:28.620
B - Pitt paid Bana $50, Bana paid Pitt $900.

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:31.690
C - They each other each other $150.

00:05:31.690 --> 00:05:37.660
(Screen lights up A)
Brad Pitt was obviously the most careless

00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:43.630
of the two stars, as he ended up paying Eric
Bana $750, while Bana didn't owe Pitt anything

00:05:43.630 --> 00:05:44.630
at all.

00:05:44.630 --> 00:05:46.790
Jaws
It's a fairly well known fact that the shark

00:05:46.790 --> 00:05:51.040
in Steven Spielberg's terrifying classic Jaws
was nicknamed "Bruce" and subsequently referred

00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:54.060
to as such on set, but who did Spielberg name
the shark after?

00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:57.150
A - His childhood bully
B - His intimidating uncle

00:05:57.150 --> 00:05:59.990
C - His lawyer
(Screen lights up C)

00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:05.520
It is actually Steven Spielberg's lawyer - a
man named Bruce Ramer - who holds the distinction

00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:08.650
of having one of the most iconic movie monsters
in history named after him.

00:06:08.650 --> 00:06:10.780
