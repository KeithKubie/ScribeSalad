00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:03.899
Duncan Hines was a Real Person

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:07.189
The name “Duncan Hines” might not ring
any bells for you until you walk down the

00:00:07.189 --> 00:00:09.280
dessert aisle in a supermarket.

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:13.880
His name is plastered on countless cake boxes
and frosting jars, and it turns out that,

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:18.250
unlike the fictitious Betty Crocker, it isn’t
just the brand name of delicious desserts,

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:21.380
but also the name of the man behind the company’s
creation.

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:25.720
He also did a lot more than box cake mixes—he
made an important leap in the realm of restaurant

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:27.570
and recipe recommendations.

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:32.029
Duncan Hines was born Bowling Green, Kentucky
on March 26, 1880.

00:00:32.029 --> 00:00:35.380
He lived with his grandparents from the age
of four following the death of his mother,

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:39.110
as his father was unable to properly care
for him due to wounds sustained in war.

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:42.430
It was his grandmother who introduced Hines
to cooking good food.

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:46.930
Jane Duncan supposedly spent many long hours
in the kitchen preparing meals, and Hines

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:51.120
once said, “Not until after I came to live
with Grandma Duncan did I realize just how

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.690
wonderful good cookery could be.”

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:57.570
That said, Hines didn’t set out to become
a master chef or have anything to do with

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:58.570
food.

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:01.580
In fact, he initially worked as a traveling
salesman for a printing company.

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:05.470
Luckily for him, long hours on the road meant
that he was able to indulge in his passion

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:08.290
for food by eating out at various restaurants.

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:09.290
It was a time of “mom and pop” stores
rather than fast food chains, meaning everywhere

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:10.290
Hines went he found something different and,
often, delicious.

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.190
It was also a time before freeway systems,
meaning Hines was able to duck into little-known

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:16.920
restaurants and cafes en route to his business
dealings rather than just those places along

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.460
main motorways.

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:21.530
The result was that Hines was able to sample
food from across the country.

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:24.870
Of course, not every restaurant experience
was a pleasant one.

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:29.130
Health inspectors rarely went out of their
way to inspect restaurants in rural areas,

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:31.030
and conditions were often less-than-sanitary.

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:35.260
Food poisoning was a common occurrence due
to the improper storage of meat.

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:39.490
As such, if the food he was served looked
bad, Hines would simply get up and pay for

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:41.300
his meal without eating it.

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:46.710
Hines kept a journal of his restaurant experiences
on the road, and soon it had over 200 entries.

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:50.461
After constantly being asked by friends for
restaurant recommendations, Hines and his

00:01:50.461 --> 00:01:55.730
wife Florence wrote a book titled Adventures
in Good Eating which was published in 1935.

00:01:55.730 --> 00:02:00.290
The book contained reviews including the name
of the restaurant, its location, a sample

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:02.049
of its menu, and prices.

00:02:02.049 --> 00:02:06.600
Small in size, it was soon kept as a reference
book in the cars of many Americans at the

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:07.600
time.

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:12.020
In the 1940s and 50s, Hines expanded on this
and wrote a newspaper column called “Adventures

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:16.240
in Good Eating at Home” in which he provided
restaurant recipes which he had collected

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:18.690
in his travels, adapted for the home chef.

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:23.780
The column was featured in newspapers across
the nation every Sunday, Tuesday, and Thursday.

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:28.010
Soon enough, “Duncan Hines” was a household
name, and “Recommended by Duncan Hines”

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:31.030
was recognized as a “seal of approval”
on recipes.

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:35.040
He continued to be a frequent diner in restaurants,
and perpetuated a myth that he would head

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:39.230
to the back of a restaurant first to check
out “the garbage situation” before sticking

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:43.000
his nose into the kitchen and seeing how the
conditions were there.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.431
He liked to make restaurants think he could
drop in on them at any moment, believing it

00:02:46.431 --> 00:02:48.770
would encourage them to keep their kitchens
clean.

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:52.770
In interviews, though, he stated that he liked
to look like an average customer when he tried

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:57.110
a new restaurant, and he always made a reservation
under a different name because he didn’t

00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:00.780
want special treatment—he wanted to provide
the public with a “real” review of the

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:03.530
restaurant, not the experience given to Duncan
Hines.

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:07.860
After he finished and paid for his meal, he
would then ask to inspect the kitchen, but

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:10.250
he still wouldn’t give the restaurant his
real name.

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:14.070
Only after the restaurant passed an inspection
would they receive notice that they had been

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:17.110
added to the “Duncan Hines Family” of
restaurants.

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:22.050
Hines teamed up with Roy Park to form Hines-Park
Foods, Inc. with the intent to bring high-quality

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:25.120
foods to American housewives in the early
1950s.

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:30.440
Hines’ name then started being used on grocery
products in 1950, but it didn’t start with

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:31.440
cake.

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:35.050
The very first Duncan Hines product was ice
cream that contained more butterfat than any

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:36.380
other ice cream on the market.

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:41.120
Putting “Duncan Hines” on the carton proved
to be such a lucrative business strategy that

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:43.260
other products weren’t far behind.

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:48.270
The company also produced around 250 items
that could be sold in cans and boxes.

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:53.019
In 1951, Nebraska Consolidated Mills began
to churn out the first of the famous Duncan

00:03:53.019 --> 00:03:57.800
Hines cake mixes, followed by bread, pancake,
and blueberry muffin mixes in the next two

00:03:57.800 --> 00:03:58.800
years.

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:03.209
In 1957, the Duncan Hines brand was sold to
Procter &amp; Gamble, who began to sell other

00:04:03.209 --> 00:04:05.560
related products under Hines’ name.

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:10.680
Two years later, in 1959, Duncan Hines died
at the age of 78 from lung cancer.

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:26.270
He was buried at a family grave site in Kentucky.
