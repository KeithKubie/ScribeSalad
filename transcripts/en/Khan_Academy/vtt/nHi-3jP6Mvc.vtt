00:00:00.415 --> 00:00:01.765
- [Voiceover] I'm here with Emily,

00:00:01.765 --> 00:00:03.248
our biology content fellow,

00:00:03.248 --> 00:00:05.099
to talk about PCR,

00:00:05.099 --> 00:00:07.410
or Polymerase Chain Reaction,

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:08.682
which you've actually done a lot of.

00:00:08.682 --> 00:00:10.494
Why have you done PCR?

00:00:10.494 --> 00:00:12.925
- [Voiceover] PCR was kind of the mainstay

00:00:12.925 --> 00:00:15.343
of my graduate project,

00:00:15.343 --> 00:00:17.262
where I built all sorts

00:00:17.262 --> 00:00:19.686
of different recombinant DNA molecules,

00:00:19.686 --> 00:00:21.901
and used them to learn
things about plants.

00:00:21.901 --> 00:00:24.569
- [Voiceover] And so what
does PCR in particular do?

00:00:24.569 --> 00:00:27.025
- [Voiceover] PCR basically
makes you a lot of copies

00:00:27.025 --> 00:00:30.241
of a particular fragment of
DNA that you're interested in.

00:00:30.241 --> 00:00:32.609
- [Voiceover] And so how does that...

00:00:32.609 --> 00:00:34.066
Why would you need to make a lot of copies

00:00:34.066 --> 00:00:36.201
of a particular fragment of DNA?

00:00:36.201 --> 00:00:39.438
- [Voiceover] So you might want
to be making lots of copies

00:00:39.438 --> 00:00:41.725
so that you can clone it into a plasmid,

00:00:41.725 --> 00:00:43.469
and then do some other
experiments with it,

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:44.795
that's a big use.

00:00:44.795 --> 00:00:46.044
- [Voiceover] So when
we talked about cloning,

00:00:46.044 --> 00:00:47.158
and we're talking about sticking

00:00:47.158 --> 00:00:49.099
a fragment of DNA inside of a plasmid,

00:00:49.099 --> 00:00:51.430
it's not like you're just
sticking one fragment

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:52.692
into one plasmid,

00:00:52.692 --> 00:00:54.274
you're doing that with many,

00:00:54.274 --> 00:00:55.951
so you need a lot of fragments of DNA.

00:00:55.951 --> 00:00:58.082
- [Voiceover] Exactly. That is exactly it.

00:00:58.082 --> 00:00:59.390
- [Voiceover] And you might start

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:01.733
with a very small sample of DNA.

00:01:01.733 --> 00:01:05.164
Where else would you have to do PCR?

00:01:05.164 --> 00:01:08.064
- [Voiceover] PCR is
used a lot in forensics,

00:01:08.064 --> 00:01:10.552
it's also used a lot
in medical diagnostics,

00:01:10.552 --> 00:01:12.704
so this could actually be your DNA

00:01:12.704 --> 00:01:15.913
that was being checked
to see if you have a gene

00:01:15.913 --> 00:01:18.330
that would predispose you
to a particular condition,

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:20.754
all sorts of really
practical applications.

00:01:20.754 --> 00:01:22.627
- [Voiceover] Because
it's hard to identify

00:01:22.627 --> 00:01:25.541
just one fragment of that gene.

00:01:25.541 --> 00:01:27.555
So you want to make copies,

00:01:27.555 --> 00:01:29.349
or as they say amplify it,

00:01:29.349 --> 00:01:31.034
so that you could run it in gels and stuff

00:01:31.034 --> 00:01:32.556
and see how all of those molecules,

00:01:32.556 --> 00:01:34.291
how big they are or something like that.

00:01:34.291 --> 00:01:35.828
- [Voiceover] Exactly,
if you were just looking

00:01:35.828 --> 00:01:38.146
in your DNA pulled out of your cell,

00:01:38.146 --> 00:01:39.802
that would be a needle in a haystack.

00:01:39.802 --> 00:01:41.762
So this is how you can really zoom in

00:01:41.762 --> 00:01:43.641
and look at just the
thing you need to see.

00:01:43.641 --> 00:01:44.610
- [Voiceover] Okay.

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:46.153
So, you've drawn some diagrams here,

00:01:46.153 --> 00:01:48.245
and I actually have never done PCR,

00:01:48.245 --> 00:01:49.139
but you have,

00:01:49.139 --> 00:01:51.452
so I'm going to tell you how
I understand it happening,

00:01:51.452 --> 00:01:53.993
and then you tell me if this makes sense.

00:01:53.993 --> 00:01:56.738
So, what you drew over here,

00:01:56.738 --> 00:01:58.997
this is double-stranded DNA,

00:01:58.997 --> 00:02:02.405
and this could have been from
a sample of someone's hair,

00:02:02.405 --> 00:02:04.452
or whatever else,

00:02:04.452 --> 00:02:07.318
and let's say we want to replicate

00:02:07.318 --> 00:02:10.839
or make many, many copies
of a fragment of this.

00:02:10.839 --> 00:02:13.226
So let's say the fragment
that we really care about

00:02:13.226 --> 00:02:16.731
is the fragment roughly from there,

00:02:16.731 --> 00:02:17.600
to...

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:19.014
There.

00:02:19.014 --> 00:02:23.149
This part is what we want
to make multiple copies of.

00:02:23.149 --> 00:02:25.068
And so this first step,

00:02:25.068 --> 00:02:27.076
denaturation...

00:02:27.076 --> 00:02:29.941
I have trouble pronouncing things.

00:02:29.941 --> 00:02:30.774
- [Voiceover] It's a weird word.

00:02:30.774 --> 00:02:32.384
- [Voiceover] It's a weird word.

00:02:32.384 --> 00:02:33.813
You have 96 degrees Celsius,

00:02:33.813 --> 00:02:35.389
so this is almost at the boiling point.

00:02:35.389 --> 00:02:36.645
So it's quite hot,

00:02:36.645 --> 00:02:40.213
and that separates the two strands.

00:02:40.213 --> 00:02:41.506
- [Voiceover] Precisely.

00:02:41.506 --> 00:02:43.349
- [Voiceover] And so
once they're separated,

00:02:43.349 --> 00:02:45.425
then you can cool things down,

00:02:45.425 --> 00:02:47.429
although this still isn't that cool.

00:02:47.429 --> 00:02:50.189
55 degrees Celsius would
be very uncomfortable.

00:02:50.189 --> 00:02:52.453
But you would cool it down to this,

00:02:52.453 --> 00:02:54.711
and then these primers show up.

00:02:54.711 --> 00:02:56.901
And so one thing to remind ourselves is,

00:02:56.901 --> 00:02:59.645
this process is happening
inside of a test tube,

00:02:59.645 --> 00:03:01.395
or in a big solution,

00:03:02.517 --> 00:03:04.632
So you heat it up, the DNA,

00:03:04.632 --> 00:03:06.057
the two strands separate,

00:03:06.057 --> 00:03:09.664
and do you just have
this primer lying around?

00:03:09.664 --> 00:03:11.482
- [Voiceover] So the primer is something

00:03:11.482 --> 00:03:13.353
that you've ordered from a company

00:03:13.353 --> 00:03:14.808
and you've ordered a lot of it,

00:03:14.808 --> 00:03:17.760
so you put in a ton of
primer in your reaction,

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:19.874
so that there's a really good chance

00:03:19.874 --> 00:03:22.894
that when you get to this
step here called annealing,

00:03:22.894 --> 00:03:24.856
that a primer is going to bind

00:03:24.856 --> 00:03:27.011
to many of your pieces of DNA.

00:03:27.011 --> 00:03:28.968
- [Voiceover] So if this is our solution,

00:03:28.968 --> 00:03:30.818
is this all happening in water?

00:03:30.818 --> 00:03:32.342
- [Voiceover] Water with some salts

00:03:32.342 --> 00:03:34.184
and stuff floating around, yeah.

00:03:34.184 --> 00:03:37.653
- [Voiceover] Okay. So we have
our solution right over here.

00:03:37.653 --> 00:03:41.408
You'd put whatever your
initial DNA sample is in there,

00:03:41.408 --> 00:03:43.792
and once again it's a very small amount,

00:03:43.792 --> 00:03:45.306
you'd put a lot of that primer,

00:03:45.306 --> 00:03:47.155
so you'd want to put
that in a lot of surplus,

00:03:47.155 --> 00:03:49.832
so let me do that in this magenta color.

00:03:49.832 --> 00:03:51.401
You obviously wouldn't
see it in real life,

00:03:51.401 --> 00:03:52.538
it would just all dissolve.

00:03:52.538 --> 00:03:55.256
- [Voiceover] It would just
look like a drop of liquid.

00:03:55.256 --> 00:03:56.195
- [Voiceover] It would look like...

00:03:56.195 --> 00:03:58.012
But for visualization,
you'd put a lot of primer,

00:03:58.012 --> 00:04:01.251
and so you heat it up,
the DNA strands separate,

00:04:01.251 --> 00:04:03.136
and then when you cool it back down,

00:04:03.136 --> 00:04:04.626
this primer is going to be specific

00:04:04.626 --> 00:04:07.554
to the ends of the region
that you want to copy.

00:04:07.554 --> 00:04:08.592
- [Voiceover] Exactly.

00:04:08.592 --> 00:04:10.840
- [Voiceover] And so when you order online

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:12.776
or wherever that you
want a certain primer,

00:04:12.776 --> 00:04:15.024
you're going to pick the
sequence of that primer

00:04:15.024 --> 00:04:16.955
to be specific to the
regions you want to copy.

00:04:16.955 --> 00:04:18.843
- [Voiceover] Exactly.
That's super important.

00:04:18.843 --> 00:04:21.099
- [Voiceover] Okay. And so
when you cool it back down,

00:04:21.099 --> 00:04:22.842
the primer attaches,

00:04:22.842 --> 00:04:25.456
and then you heat it back up,

00:04:25.456 --> 00:04:27.667
not quite to the 96 degrees Celsius,

00:04:27.667 --> 00:04:29.384
but to the 72 degrees Celsius,

00:04:29.384 --> 00:04:31.435
where you extend those.

00:04:31.435 --> 00:04:32.738
And I'm assuming since it's called

00:04:32.738 --> 00:04:34.618
Polymerase Chain Reaction,

00:04:34.618 --> 00:04:36.819
that this is where the
polymerase is involved.

00:04:36.819 --> 00:04:39.042
- [Voiceover] That is exactly
where the polymerase comes in.

00:04:39.042 --> 00:04:41.140
- [Voiceover] So the polymerase

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:44.194
is what is actually extending this.

00:04:44.194 --> 00:04:47.928
So I'll just draw a polymerase
enzyme right over there,

00:04:47.928 --> 00:04:49.594
doing the extending,

00:04:49.594 --> 00:04:52.122
and is it any type of polymerase enzyme?

00:04:52.122 --> 00:04:54.374
Can I just take the
polymerase from my cells

00:04:54.374 --> 00:04:56.074
and throw it in there?

00:04:56.074 --> 00:04:58.684
- [Voiceover] So you actually
need a special polymerase,

00:04:58.684 --> 00:05:00.074
because you need one that is going

00:05:00.074 --> 00:05:01.269
to be pretty heat-resistant,

00:05:01.269 --> 00:05:02.442
so as you were mentioning,

00:05:02.442 --> 00:05:04.170
even the cool step of this process

00:05:04.170 --> 00:05:05.650
is not something that your body

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:07.658
would want to be hanging out in.

00:05:07.658 --> 00:05:09.654
So the polymerase is actually from

00:05:09.654 --> 00:05:12.402
a really heat-tolerant micro-organism.

00:05:12.402 --> 00:05:14.765
- [Voiceover] And what is that?

00:05:14.765 --> 00:05:16.244
It's called a taq polymerase?

00:05:16.244 --> 00:05:18.826
- [Voiceover] It's thermophilus
aquaticus, I think?

00:05:18.826 --> 00:05:20.164
Makes quite a mouthful.

00:05:20.164 --> 00:05:23.215
- [Voiceover] And they
found it at heated vents,

00:05:23.215 --> 00:05:26.586
this organism that is able to
stand these high temperatures.

00:05:26.586 --> 00:05:30.010
But that I guess leads
to another question,

00:05:30.010 --> 00:05:33.069
which is why do you have to
heat it up to begin with?

00:05:33.069 --> 00:05:35.778
I guess just to separate the two strands?

00:05:35.778 --> 00:05:37.578
- [Voiceover] That's
really the key reason.

00:05:37.578 --> 00:05:38.890
You just have to get them apart,

00:05:38.890 --> 00:05:40.244
you don't have an enzyme to do it

00:05:40.244 --> 00:05:41.578
the way you might in a cell,

00:05:41.578 --> 00:05:43.250
so heat does the trick.

00:05:43.250 --> 00:05:44.305
- [Voiceover] Okay, so I get it.

00:05:44.305 --> 00:05:45.564
So this is one step,

00:05:45.564 --> 00:05:49.658
I'm getting at least the
polymerase part of the PCR,

00:05:49.658 --> 00:05:51.463
where you heat it up,

00:05:51.463 --> 00:05:53.434
the strands separate,

00:05:53.434 --> 00:05:56.780
then you have all of
this extra primer there.

00:05:56.780 --> 00:05:59.002
Because there's so much primer,

00:05:59.002 --> 00:06:02.138
the primer is much more likely to bind to,

00:06:02.138 --> 00:06:04.019
at least at this part of the sequence,

00:06:04.019 --> 00:06:05.994
then for these two strands
to get back together

00:06:05.994 --> 00:06:07.178
at this point,

00:06:07.178 --> 00:06:09.306
and then you have the polymerase,

00:06:09.306 --> 00:06:11.083
the taq polymerase in particular,

00:06:11.083 --> 00:06:12.808
and you would have added
that at the beginning,

00:06:12.808 --> 00:06:14.044
the taq polymerase,

00:06:14.044 --> 00:06:17.267
I guess I'll put it in a yellow color.

00:06:17.267 --> 00:06:21.016
So you would also put all
that taq polymerase in there.

00:06:21.016 --> 00:06:23.731
And once again, these
things aren't robots,

00:06:23.731 --> 00:06:25.096
they don't know exactly
what they need to do,

00:06:25.096 --> 00:06:26.576
they just bump into
things in the right way

00:06:26.576 --> 00:06:27.944
and react in the right way,

00:06:27.944 --> 00:06:29.195
and then you would also have to add

00:06:29.195 --> 00:06:30.176
a bunch of nucleotides.

00:06:30.176 --> 00:06:31.266
- [Voiceover] Yes, absolutely.

00:06:31.266 --> 00:06:32.673
Your reaction is not going to work

00:06:32.673 --> 00:06:34.587
if you forget the nucleotides.

00:06:34.587 --> 00:06:36.573
- [Voiceover] So, the taq polymerase,

00:06:36.573 --> 00:06:38.722
when you heat it back up again

00:06:38.722 --> 00:06:40.728
after the primers have been attached,

00:06:40.728 --> 00:06:43.209
is going to start adding
all of these nucleotides.

00:06:43.209 --> 00:06:45.066
And what, do you just wait
a certain amount of time?

00:06:45.066 --> 00:06:47.093
Will it just keep going on forever?

00:06:47.093 --> 00:06:49.897
- [Voiceover] It'll keep
going on for a while,

00:06:49.897 --> 00:06:52.130
usually you do pick
the length of that step

00:06:52.130 --> 00:06:54.809
to match how much time
you expect the polymerase

00:06:54.809 --> 00:06:57.633
to need to complete your fragment.

00:06:57.633 --> 00:06:59.801
But it kind of will stop.

00:06:59.801 --> 00:07:01.945
Either it will fall off or it'll stop

00:07:01.945 --> 00:07:03.777
when you go on to the next step.

00:07:03.777 --> 00:07:06.039
- [Voiceover] Okay, so
this, I get this so far.

00:07:06.039 --> 00:07:08.755
So, so far we have after one cycle,

00:07:08.755 --> 00:07:10.665
what you've written here,

00:07:10.665 --> 00:07:13.264
after one cycle we would have doubled

00:07:13.264 --> 00:07:17.144
at least that part of the
sequence that we care about.

00:07:17.144 --> 00:07:20.929
Although we might have copied
even beyond that sequence.

00:07:20.929 --> 00:07:23.780
So, where does the chain
reaction come into this?

00:07:23.780 --> 00:07:26.371
- [Voiceover] So I guess you
can interpret chain reaction

00:07:26.371 --> 00:07:27.553
in two ways,

00:07:27.553 --> 00:07:30.217
and one is that's sort of
what the polymerase does,

00:07:30.217 --> 00:07:32.513
is you know, add things to make a chain,

00:07:32.513 --> 00:07:35.204
but there's actually even
more of a chain reaction

00:07:35.204 --> 00:07:36.432
to mention here,

00:07:36.432 --> 00:07:38.608
and that's that we're actually getting

00:07:38.608 --> 00:07:41.525
this kind of exponential process going on.

00:07:41.525 --> 00:07:43.200
- [Voiceover] So you do it one cycle,

00:07:43.200 --> 00:07:44.658
you get to this situation right here,

00:07:44.658 --> 00:07:46.353
you heat it up, the strands separate,

00:07:46.353 --> 00:07:48.553
you cool it down, the primers attach,

00:07:48.553 --> 00:07:52.625
you heat it up again, the
taq polymerase does its job,

00:07:52.625 --> 00:07:54.016
and like all polymerase,

00:07:54.016 --> 00:07:56.289
it goes from the 5 prime
to the 3 prime direction,

00:07:56.289 --> 00:07:58.066
we talked about that in the application.

00:07:58.066 --> 00:07:58.899
- [Voiceover] Precisely.

00:07:58.899 --> 00:08:00.277
- [Voiceover] So now you have two strands,

00:08:00.277 --> 00:08:01.834
but now, since all of that
stuff is in that solution,

00:08:01.834 --> 00:08:03.822
you can heat it up again,

00:08:03.822 --> 00:08:07.396
now these two strands can turn into...

00:08:07.396 --> 00:08:10.367
Or these two double strands can now

00:08:10.367 --> 00:08:12.715
turn into four single strands,

00:08:12.715 --> 00:08:14.949
then you can cool it down again.

00:08:14.949 --> 00:08:17.055
Now, they get primers attached to them,

00:08:17.055 --> 00:08:18.308
and they're still the same primer,

00:08:18.308 --> 00:08:20.836
because we still care
about the same sequence.

00:08:20.836 --> 00:08:24.157
And so now you go from one to two to four,

00:08:24.157 --> 00:08:25.980
and so you keep repeating this.

00:08:25.980 --> 00:08:27.276
And so how many times would it be typical

00:08:27.276 --> 00:08:29.044
for you to repeat this cycle?

00:08:29.044 --> 00:08:32.115
- [Voiceover] So like, 35 might
be a pretty typical number

00:08:32.115 --> 00:08:33.284
of cycles to do.

00:08:33.284 --> 00:08:34.562
It depends a little what you're doing.

00:08:34.562 --> 00:08:36.333
But you're going to do it a lot of times.

00:08:36.333 --> 00:08:38.804
- [Voiceover] And so if
you do this 35 times,

00:08:38.804 --> 00:08:40.547
I mean each time you're multiplying by 2.

00:08:40.547 --> 00:08:43.171
So it would be 2 to the 35th power,

00:08:43.171 --> 00:08:46.444
which is well over a billion times,

00:08:46.444 --> 00:08:48.267
so how long would that take?

00:08:48.267 --> 00:08:49.563
You've done this before.

00:08:49.563 --> 00:08:51.611
- [Voiceover] It depends on
the length of your fragment,

00:08:51.611 --> 00:08:53.629
but usually like two to three hours.

00:08:53.629 --> 00:08:54.883
- [Voiceover] So in two to three hours,

00:08:54.883 --> 00:08:56.434
you can start with one fragment,

00:08:56.434 --> 00:08:58.260
and get into the billions.

00:08:58.260 --> 00:09:00.493
- [Voiceover] If it's perfectly efficient,

00:09:00.493 --> 00:09:01.755
which I wish it always were,

00:09:01.755 --> 00:09:04.839
but you usually get
quite a few pieces made.

00:09:04.839 --> 00:09:06.782
- [Voiceover] And one thing
that I've always wondered

00:09:06.782 --> 00:09:08.710
when I first learned about this,

00:09:08.710 --> 00:09:11.191
and I'd like to go into a
lab and do this with you,

00:09:11.191 --> 00:09:14.862
is okay, I get that you have your primer,

00:09:14.862 --> 00:09:19.029
and then the polymerase is
just going to extend it,

00:09:20.029 --> 00:09:20.862
like that,

00:09:20.862 --> 00:09:22.852
but I was like well, it's going to be...

00:09:22.852 --> 00:09:24.375
How does it know where to stop?

00:09:24.375 --> 00:09:25.622
And you explained, well,

00:09:25.622 --> 00:09:28.831
on that first pass, it might
not know where to stop,

00:09:28.831 --> 00:09:31.375
but then when you start
going in the other direction,

00:09:31.375 --> 00:09:32.787
it's going to, so over here,

00:09:32.787 --> 00:09:34.104
when it goes in the other direction,

00:09:34.104 --> 00:09:35.640
it's going to hit a...

00:09:35.640 --> 00:09:38.167
It's not going to have
anything else to copy.

00:09:38.167 --> 00:09:39.527
- [Voiceover] Exactly.

00:09:39.527 --> 00:09:42.804
- [Voiceover] So most of
the billions of molecules

00:09:42.804 --> 00:09:43.852
that you produce,

00:09:43.852 --> 00:09:47.795
are going to be both ends
kind of a nice clean cut.

00:09:47.795 --> 00:09:51.023
- [Voiceover] The vast,
vast majority, exactly.

00:09:51.023 --> 00:09:52.871
- [Voiceover] Fascinating.
