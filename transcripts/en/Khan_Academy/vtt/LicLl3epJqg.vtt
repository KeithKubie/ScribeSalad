00:00:00.586 --> 00:00:02.456
- [Sal] Esther, I'm in so much trouble!

00:00:03.176 --> 00:00:04.617
- [Esther] What happened, Sal?

00:00:05.387 --> 00:00:08.449
- [Sal] Ben Eater, the number
eater, ate all my numbers

00:00:08.449 --> 00:00:10.551
on my perfect number grid.

00:00:10.551 --> 00:00:14.544
- [Ben] Hahahaha! Those
were some good numbers!

00:00:14.544 --> 00:00:17.050
(chewing)

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:20.499
I better get out of here
before I get into some trouble!

00:00:21.083 --> 00:00:22.502
- [Sal] Ben!

00:00:22.817 --> 00:00:24.387
Esther, what do I do?

00:00:24.387 --> 00:00:26.217
- [Esther] It's okay, Sal.

00:00:26.217 --> 00:00:29.400
We can work together to
find the missing numbers.

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:31.650
Actually, I think our friends who are

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:34.284
watching the video can help us with it.

00:00:34.284 --> 00:00:37.217
So, friend, go ahead and pause the video

00:00:37.217 --> 00:00:40.933
and see if you can figure
out the missing numbers.

00:00:42.121 --> 00:00:43.550
- [Sal] Okay, I'm assuming our friends

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:45.151
have given a go at it.

00:00:45.151 --> 00:00:47.485
So how would you think about this, Esther?

00:00:47.485 --> 00:00:49.667
- [Esther] Let's see, hmm.

00:00:49.883 --> 00:00:53.984
Well, maybe I can use the
numbers that are before

00:00:53.984 --> 00:00:57.302
the missing number to
help us figure this out.

00:00:57.483 --> 00:01:00.150
So let's see, if we go from

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:05.115
4, 5, 6, 7!

00:01:05.985 --> 00:01:07.533
- [Sal] That makes sense.

00:01:08.315 --> 00:01:09.817
What about this one?

00:01:09.817 --> 00:01:11.217
- [Esther] Hmm.

00:01:11.217 --> 00:01:14.083
Let's see, let's see if we
can figure out what would

00:01:14.083 --> 00:01:17.367
come after the number 13.

00:01:17.757 --> 00:01:18.921
- [Sal] Maybe we should get our friends

00:01:18.921 --> 00:01:20.483
to think about it first.

00:01:20.483 --> 00:01:21.897
- [Esther] Good idea.

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:23.858
- [Sal] So I'm assuming they tried.

00:01:23.858 --> 00:01:24.883
So how do you think about it?

00:01:24.883 --> 00:01:27.187
What number comes after 13?

00:01:27.187 --> 00:01:30.567
- [Esther] Let's see, 13, 14!

00:01:31.327 --> 00:01:32.388
- [Sal] And that works out, because then

00:01:32.388 --> 00:01:35.075
14 is the number that comes before 15.

00:01:35.075 --> 00:01:36.587
- [Esther] Exactly.

00:01:36.587 --> 00:01:37.751
- [Sal] I see.

00:01:37.751 --> 00:01:40.183
Now look at this, this
is all the way out here.

00:01:40.183 --> 00:01:42.456
How are you going to figure
this one out, Esther?

00:01:42.456 --> 00:01:44.333
- [Esther] Hmm, let's see.

00:01:44.516 --> 00:01:46.350
Maybe I can look at the numbers that come

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:48.267
after the missing number.

00:01:48.484 --> 00:01:53.451
So if we have 37 and 38 and 39,

00:01:53.451 --> 00:01:58.267
I think 36 comes before 37!

00:01:59.084 --> 00:02:00.916
- [Sal] Oh, that makes a lot of sense.

00:02:01.366 --> 00:02:03.724
And what about this one
that's right below it?

00:02:03.724 --> 00:02:07.225
- [Esther] Okay, let's see,
I think I'm gonna count

00:02:07.225 --> 00:02:09.017
in a different way.

00:02:09.017 --> 00:02:12.183
I'm gonna go from the top to the bottom.

00:02:12.183 --> 00:02:14.060
- [Sal] Wow, how are you going to do that?

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:17.017
- [Esther] Let's see, I'll
start with number 6, and I'll

00:02:17.017 --> 00:02:21.970
go down to 16, go down to 26,

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:23.790
go down to 36.

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:25.049
- [Sal] I think I see a pattern here.

00:02:25.049 --> 00:02:27.284
All of these numbers have a 6.

00:02:27.284 --> 00:02:29.949
- [Esther] Exactly. So I think if we're

00:02:29.949 --> 00:02:33.834
in the missing number, that's gonna be 46.

00:02:34.283 --> 00:02:36.050
- [Sal] Oh, I see, that makes sense.

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:40.754
Cos here this was, we're in 26, then 36,

00:02:40.986 --> 00:02:42.722
here we're in the 40s.

00:02:42.722 --> 00:02:44.550
So it's going to be 46.

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:45.993
- [Esther] Exactly!

00:02:45.993 --> 00:02:47.118
- [Sal] That's really cool.

00:02:47.118 --> 00:02:48.484
Now what about these three down here?

00:02:48.484 --> 00:02:50.283
Maybe our friends can pause first and see

00:02:50.283 --> 00:02:52.067
if they can figure it out.

00:02:52.151 --> 00:02:53.700
- [Esther] Sounds good!

00:02:54.683 --> 00:02:57.617
- [Sal] Okay, how would
I tackle this, Esther?

00:02:57.617 --> 00:03:00.883
- [Esther] Let's see. Well,
there are three missing numbers

00:03:00.883 --> 00:03:05.400
all in a row, so let's look at
the numbers before and after.

00:03:05.817 --> 00:03:10.817
So we have 81, 82, 83, 84!

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:14.051
- [Sal] Oh, that makes
sense cos we're in the 80s.

00:03:14.051 --> 00:03:16.919
And so just like we have 1, 2, 3, 4,

00:03:16.919 --> 00:03:20.502
now it's 81, 82, 83, 84.

00:03:20.818 --> 00:03:22.017
- [Esther] Exactly.

00:03:22.017 --> 00:03:26.801
And I know the number
that is next to 84 is 85.

00:03:27.184 --> 00:03:29.950
- [Sal] And we know that
because 5 comes after 4,

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:32.951
so 85 comes after 84.

00:03:32.951 --> 00:03:33.883
- [Esther] Bingo!

00:03:33.883 --> 00:03:35.914
- [Sal] Wow. And this would be...

00:03:35.914 --> 00:03:37.708
- [Both] 86!

00:03:38.717 --> 00:03:40.251
- [Sal] Very exciting.

00:03:40.251 --> 00:03:41.884
- [Esther] Very fun.

00:03:41.884 --> 00:03:43.817
("Charge")

00:03:43.817 --> 00:03:46.083
- [Sal] Oh no, it's Ben
Eater the number eater again!

00:03:46.083 --> 00:03:48.924
- [Ben] Oh, more numbers to munch on!

00:03:48.924 --> 00:03:50.907
I'm getting hungry!
