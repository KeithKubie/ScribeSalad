00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:10.860
I don't think there's really a lot of

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:10.870
I don't think there's really a lot of
 

00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:13.350
I don't think there's really a lot of
evidence yet in people that we can

00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:13.360
evidence yet in people that we can
 

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:15.600
evidence yet in people that we can
increase lifespan by affecting stem

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:15.610
increase lifespan by affecting stem
 

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:17.339
increase lifespan by affecting stem
cells and actually it's important to

00:00:17.339 --> 00:00:17.349
cells and actually it's important to
 

00:00:17.349 --> 00:00:19.710
cells and actually it's important to
realize that as we age the number of

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:19.720
realize that as we age the number of
 

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:21.660
realize that as we age the number of
functional stem cells we have declines

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:21.670
functional stem cells we have declines
 

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:23.490
functional stem cells we have declines
and you know who knows it may be that

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:23.500
and you know who knows it may be that
 

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:26.189
and you know who knows it may be that
some of the disorders that we have in

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:26.199
some of the disorders that we have in
 

00:00:26.199 --> 00:00:27.689
some of the disorders that we have in
the aging population are a consequence

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:27.699
the aging population are a consequence
 

00:00:27.699 --> 00:00:29.310
the aging population are a consequence
of running out of stem cells and being

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:29.320
of running out of stem cells and being
 

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:32.040
of running out of stem cells and being
unable to replenish our own tissues and

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:32.050
unable to replenish our own tissues and
 

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:34.170
unable to replenish our own tissues and
organs and that may well be true of the

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:34.180
organs and that may well be true of the
 

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:35.640
organs and that may well be true of the
brain for sure and I and there's some

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:35.650
brain for sure and I and there's some
 

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:37.080
brain for sure and I and there's some
evidence that that's also true in other

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:37.090
evidence that that's also true in other
 

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:39.509
evidence that that's also true in other
organs so I think it may be the loss of

00:00:39.509 --> 00:00:39.519
organs so I think it may be the loss of
 

00:00:39.519 --> 00:00:41.549
organs so I think it may be the loss of
stem cells that is part of the aging

00:00:41.549 --> 00:00:41.559
stem cells that is part of the aging
 

00:00:41.559 --> 00:00:44.460
stem cells that is part of the aging
population it's a very good question if

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:44.470
population it's a very good question if
 

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:46.500
population it's a very good question if
we if we could restore stem cells

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:46.510
we if we could restore stem cells
 

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:48.180
we if we could restore stem cells
particularly in some of those critical

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:48.190
particularly in some of those critical
 

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:51.380
particularly in some of those critical
organs would we increase lifespan and

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390
organs would we increase lifespan and
 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:53.850
organs would we increase lifespan and
would we even want to I think it's a

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:53.860
would we even want to I think it's a
 

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:55.410
would we even want to I think it's a
it's a philosophical as well as a

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:55.420
it's a philosophical as well as a
 

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:57.660
it's a philosophical as well as a
scientific question and we don't have

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:57.670
scientific question and we don't have
 

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:00.299
scientific question and we don't have
the answer tonight
