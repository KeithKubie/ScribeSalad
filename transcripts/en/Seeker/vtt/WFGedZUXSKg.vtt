00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:02.540
When I meet someone I can tell where they’re
from right away.

00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:06.220
I don’t even need to hear their accent,
just 3 minutes alone in their office with

00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:09.380
some q-tips.

00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:14.389
Hello ladies and germs, Trace here for DNews.

00:00:14.389 --> 00:00:15.389
Microbes.

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:18.920
Those little guys are everywhere: cell phones,
door knobs, eating utensils.

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:21.560
If you have to touch it, it’s got bacteria
on it.

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:26.930
You have 10 times more bacteria cells in/on
your body than your own actual human cells,

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:29.560
and they make up 1 to 3% of your weight.

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:34.630
Everywhere you look there are so many microbes
that they form little communities called microbiomes,

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:39.200
and those microbiomes will vary a lot from
place to place, even just within your own

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:40.200
body.

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.940
And scientists are just beginning to understand
them.

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:47.370
Strangely enough, while the microbiomes populating
the short span from your butt to your face

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:51.980
are all really different, thankfully, the
ones in your office are surprisingly similar

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:54.010
to what you’d find in any office across
town.

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:58.250
That’s according to a new study published
in the American Society for Microbiology’s

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:00.010
journal mSystems.

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:05.480
The study examined the bacterial diversity
in 9 offices in San Diego, Toronto, and Flagstaff,

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:06.480
Arizona.

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:10.000
Researchers placed sterilized plates on the
floor, wall, and ceiling of each office and

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.690
controlled for materials by having carpet,
drywall, and ceiling tile on each plate.

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:19.250
Over the course of a year, they would come
in, swab the plates with cotton and analyze

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:20.600
the DNA sequences present.

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:22.760
Firstly, some of your instincts are correct.

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:26.050
Yes, the floor of your work is a seething
cauldron of biodiversity.

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:31.130
No matter the city, the season, or the material,
the floor always had the highest variety of

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:32.130
microbes.

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:35.560
So if you’re going to drop your food, try
and get it on the wall instead of the carpet.

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:40.490
Secondly, it turns out microbiomes inside
built environments within a single city are

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:41.850
surprisingly uniform.

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:47.720
So much so, that the researchers could guess
where unlabeled samples came from with 85%

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:48.720
accuracy.

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:53.450
There were similarities across all cities:
Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, and Actinobacteria

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:59.770
were the 3 dominant phyla everywhere, but
each cities exact composition was so precise

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:02.890
it was like a bacterial fingerprint.

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:06.550
Researchers asked office workers not to touch
the experiment, so the humans in the office

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:10.670
didn’t have as much impact on the samples
as they otherwise might have… but we still

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:13.040
got our grossness on everything.

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:17.210
Sure, each office has that one weird guy that
we all know isn’t washing his hands…

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:18.210
Kevin.

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:21.731
But even without the Kevins of the world rubbing
their grubby mitts on the experiment, humans

00:02:21.731 --> 00:02:26.780
had a moderate impact on the results: 25 to
30% of the microbes detected are associated

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:29.920
with humans, particularly those from human
skin.

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:30.920
Yum.

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:34.730
The researchers called this a landmark paper,
because they controlled for some of the assumptions

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:37.510
we made about indoor and outdoor spaces.

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:41.580
Humans are all sort of like Pig Pens, but
instead of dirt swirling around us, we each

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:44.730
carry our own micro-organistic solar system…
so to speak.

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:49.400
Now scientists need to learn how to create
buildings and spaces that better reflect the

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:52.620
natural microbiota of the surrounding region!

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:57.160
For example, what's the microbiome of somewhere
FILLED with Kevins: a New York City subway

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:58.160
station!

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:03.370
A 2013 Weill Cornell Medical College research
project called PathoMap attempted to find

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:07.890
out if the bacteria differ from one stop to
the next!

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:12.810
Undergrads set to work on 466 of the city's
stations, swabbing turnstiles, railings, and

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:15.880
the insides of cars with q-tips for 3 minutes
at a time.

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:19.920
I'm sure no one noticed, because… you know,
anything can happen on the Subway.

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:25.050
Their DNA sequences revealed the biodiversity
was significantly different from one borough

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:26.270
to the next!

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:31.160
The Bronx had the widest variety of species,
while Staten Island was the most vanilla.

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:35.550
Bacteria specialized for human skin were the
most common, with a close second being bacteria

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:38.489
from the business end of the gastrointestinal
tract…

00:03:38.489 --> 00:03:39.780
You know what I’m talking about.

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:44.160
Though the researchers noted they didn’t
find as much fecal bacteria as they expected.

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:45.320
Hooray for New York?

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:49.410
The project has since gone worldwide under
the name MetaSUB, so people from Beijing to

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:54.120
Barcelona can learn just how much gastrointestinal
bacteria they’re sharing the ride with.

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:58.381
I know all this talk of the world being covered
in bacteria may make some of you squirm, but

00:03:58.381 --> 00:04:00.810
usually those little guys are helping you
out.

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:05.430
Then again sometimes they’re not, but there
is one dead giveaway when your gut bacteria

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:06.769
are out of order.

00:04:06.769 --> 00:04:31.709
Julian covers it here.
