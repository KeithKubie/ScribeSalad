SZYMON PERKOWSKI:
Greetings, everyone.

00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:04.410
I'm Szymon Perkowski.

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:07.920
Today I'm excited to welcome
scientist, author, and speaker

00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:09.570
Dr. Paul Zak.

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:14.210
In 2004, his lab
discovered that oxytocin,

00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:18.090
AKA the moral molecule, allows
us to determine who to trust.

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:20.360
His work on oxytocin
and relationships

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:22.790
has earned him the
nickname "Dr. Love."

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:24.690
And his book, "The
Moral Molecule,

00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:26.410
the Source of Love
and Prosperity"

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:30.180
was a finalist for the
Wellcome Trust book prize.

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:33.340
Dr. Zak was featured in a
Fast Company article related

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:36.950
to the role of social
networking in oxytocin release,

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:40.690
was named one of "Wired"
magazine's 10 Sexiest Geeks,

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:44.130
and his Ted Talk has gained
over a million views.

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:46.830
He is credited with the first
published use of the term

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:50.120
"neuroeconomics" and is the
founding director of the Center

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:53.065
of Neuroeconomic Studies at
Claremont Graduate University.

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:55.610
Today, he's going
to talk about how

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:58.360
to measure organizational
trust, policies

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:00.380
that will increase
trust, and how this

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:02.540
affects organization's goals.

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:04.427
Please join me in
welcoming Paul.

00:01:04.427 --> 00:01:06.862
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:11.470
PAUL ZAK: Hi, everybody.

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:12.225
Welcome.

00:01:12.225 --> 00:01:15.340
And everybody watching
in the live stream.

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:16.690
Very happy to be here.

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:22.300
And I want to be both useful
and slightly entertaining.

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:24.890
So that's my goal.

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:29.380
So I helped start this
field called neuroeconomics.

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:30.920
I'll tell you a
little about that.

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:33.350
We want to now
penetrate neuroscience

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:35.350
into management and culture.

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:38.115
So that's what we're going
to focus on primarily today.

00:01:38.115 --> 00:01:39.490
I don't know any
human resources.

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:42.550
I know a lot of humans.

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:46.170
I like that you don't have--
HR is just the worst word ever.

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:49.220
So yes, people ops, much better.

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:52.050
Human development, better.

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:55.352
So let's talk about
how to design cultures

00:01:55.352 --> 00:01:57.060
for high engagement
and high performance.

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:59.495
That's the stuff we've been
doing for five or six years,

00:01:59.495 --> 00:02:00.750
and I will tell you about.

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:02.080
So here's an analogy.

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:06.400
You have friends, I presume.

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:08.870
Your friends invite
you for dinner.

00:02:08.870 --> 00:02:11.100
Finish dinner, Eric
finished dinner

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:13.140
and he says, oh, it
was really great.

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:16.786
Here's $20 for the--

00:02:16.786 --> 00:02:18.182
That would be weird, right?

00:02:18.182 --> 00:02:19.640
Why would you pay
someone when they

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:22.550
invited you to do something
that was enjoyable presumably

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:24.350
for them and for you?

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:29.170
So once we understand work
as not something that is,

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:31.280
in econo-speak,
providing "dis-utility,"

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:34.290
something that can be actually
very enjoyable and fulfilling,

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:37.460
then why are we incentivizing
people with money for every

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:39.890
little task they do?

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:42.990
I think many tech companies,
Google in particular,

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:44.170
is an exception to this.

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:46.940
But still we're
thinking about, oh,

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:48.890
what this person really
wants is to somehow

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:51.300
get recognized with more money.

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:54.120
In which the process
of doing things often

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:55.630
is super interesting.

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:59.130
So when I started working in
neuroeconomics about 12 years

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:01.265
ago, before there
was a term for it,

00:03:01.265 --> 00:03:03.740
I wanted to take a very
humble view and just ask,

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:07.370
instead of saying you're
irrational, or you're selfish.

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:09.860
Why not just measure
what your brain's doing

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:11.539
while you're making decisions.

00:03:11.539 --> 00:03:12.580
Maybe they involve money.

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:13.660
Maybe they don't.

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:19.610
And then from that, build a
foundation for decision making

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:21.500
that's based on the
brain and not based

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:25.410
on some philosophical
tradition about stuff

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:27.424
is everything in
the world for me.

00:03:27.424 --> 00:03:29.340
I like stuff, but there's
lots of other things

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:31.010
I like beside stuff.

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:34.350
So why am I so
focused on economics

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:35.835
on just getting more stuff?

00:03:35.835 --> 00:03:36.835
Because it's measurable.

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:39.740
So for management, we
did the same thing.

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:44.280
Let's get rid of all the
stuff you learned at MBA

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:45.200
school or whatever.

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:50.590
And just start out with
thinking about people at work

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:52.170
as volunteers.

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:54.330
Essentially you
are all volunteers.

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:55.510
You're choosing to be here.

00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:58.240
You have a lot of skills,
and you can take those skills

00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:00.540
and go somewhere else with them.

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:02.670
So if I think about
creating a culture where

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:05.660
volunteers love to show up.

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:07.229
They're super engaged.

00:04:07.229 --> 00:04:08.020
They're challenged.

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:09.200
They're recognized.

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:11.410
What kind of culture
would that be?

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:13.070
So that was my
starting point for what

00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:14.650
I'm calling neuro-management.

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:18.269
How do we actually just
start from that idea?

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:20.540
Now, we have a lot of knowledge
in social neuroscience

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:23.800
about why people
voluntarily come together

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:25.520
to work on any kind of project.

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:27.470
So let's take that
knowledge and then try

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:30.350
to build a foundation using
neuroscience to understand

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:33.200
cultures and people who are
choosing to work together

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:35.274
on projects in cultures.

00:04:35.274 --> 00:04:36.440
So that's where we're going.

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:38.980
Try to be very, very practical.

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:41.980
I guess my confession is
not an engineer, but son

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:43.049
of an engineer.

00:04:43.049 --> 00:04:45.340
So we take a very engineering
approach to neuroscience.

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:47.374
We're going to run
experiments, then use

00:04:47.374 --> 00:04:48.665
that data to create a solution.

00:04:48.665 --> 00:04:51.850
And that solution could be, as
you'll see, could be a survey.

00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:53.320
Could be a piece of software.

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:55.780
So we want to really make
this solution focused.

00:04:55.780 --> 00:05:01.430
Otherwise it's interesting and
fun, but not valuable, I think.

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:04.120
So now we have a decision point.

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:07.740
I need to give you five
minutes of the background, some

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:11.150
of the experiments that have
proceeded all this work.

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:13.740
And either I can do
that for five minutes,

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:15.250
show you lots of
tables and graphs,

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:17.940
or we can have the buttery
voice of Morgan Freeman

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:19.420
tell us about it.

00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:20.990
Me or Morgan?

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:22.550
Let's do Morgan, just for fun.

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:25.340
I don't know why.

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:26.972
So that was from
Morgan Freeman's show

00:05:26.972 --> 00:05:27.930
"Through the Wormhole."

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:30.990
And obviously a little more
dramatic than the experiments

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:32.400
we run in the laboratory.

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:35.760
But that was preceded by a
dozen years of experiments

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:39.650
in which we designed
tasks that we thought

00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:42.680
would induce the brain to make
oxytocin, this molecule that

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:44.640
makes us care about others.

00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:46.560
And we've shown,
both in field studies

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:51.280
and in laboratory studies,
that, in fact, almost everybody

00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:53.240
has the appropriate response.

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:55.460
And essentially, it's
one of the golden rule.

00:05:55.460 --> 00:05:56.920
So I'm nice to Eric.

00:05:56.920 --> 00:05:58.050
His brain makes oxytocin.

00:05:58.050 --> 00:06:00.982
It motivates him to
reciprocate kind with kind.

00:06:00.982 --> 00:06:03.440
Now, there's an anti-golden
rule and we can talk about that

00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:04.519
some other time.

00:06:04.519 --> 00:06:06.810
If you're bad to me, I'm
going to be really bad to you.

00:06:06.810 --> 00:06:09.430
And that's also a
way we can play.

00:06:09.430 --> 00:06:11.210
So we've done this
lots of places.

00:06:11.210 --> 00:06:14.540
This is a picture of me with
my "tribe" in Papua New Guinea.

00:06:14.540 --> 00:06:16.290
So I did an experiment
in the rain forests

00:06:16.290 --> 00:06:17.164
of Papua New Guinea.

00:06:17.164 --> 00:06:18.830
If you guys know about
Papua New Guinea,

00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:21.120
you know there are
800 distinct languages

00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:22.640
in this little volcanic island.

00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:24.430
It's like going back
in the stone age.

00:06:24.430 --> 00:06:25.180
No running water.

00:06:25.180 --> 00:06:26.800
No electricity.

00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:28.617
No bathrooms.

00:06:28.617 --> 00:06:30.200
I mean, it's really,
really primitive.

00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:33.980
And even these guys in an
ecologically valid setting

00:06:33.980 --> 00:06:37.090
induce oxytocin release
when they engage in rituals.

00:06:37.090 --> 00:06:38.670
So it seems to be
a human universal.

00:06:38.670 --> 00:06:40.670
So as we began
studying this, we spent

00:06:40.670 --> 00:06:43.875
a lot of time
understanding what inhibits

00:06:43.875 --> 00:06:46.080
the release of oxytocin,
what promotes it,

00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:48.850
so we could really understand
how this brain system allows

00:06:48.850 --> 00:06:52.079
us to navigate through the sea
of strangers in which we live.

00:06:52.079 --> 00:06:54.370
And one of the places that
we live with other strangers

00:06:54.370 --> 00:06:55.800
is at work.

00:06:55.800 --> 00:06:58.350
And so as we start
thinking about how

00:06:58.350 --> 00:07:02.330
do we apply this to understand
why some organizations reach

00:07:02.330 --> 00:07:06.070
high performance and others
don't perform very well at all.

00:07:06.070 --> 00:07:08.230
Start thinking of a
simple model that we

00:07:08.230 --> 00:07:10.110
could use in neuroscience
to understand that,

00:07:10.110 --> 00:07:12.010
which I call the POP model.

00:07:12.010 --> 00:07:15.540
So POP stands for people,
organization, and purpose.

00:07:15.540 --> 00:07:17.240
So people is hiring.

00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:19.980
So we could do a whole
other day on hiring.

00:07:19.980 --> 00:07:21.870
Not going to talk
about it today.

00:07:21.870 --> 00:07:26.590
So in short, you know
the right thing to do,

00:07:26.590 --> 00:07:29.384
which is hire smart people
for the right cultural fit.

00:07:29.384 --> 00:07:31.300
What we do want to talk
about is organization.

00:07:31.300 --> 00:07:33.020
So I can take great
people, put them

00:07:33.020 --> 00:07:35.030
in a really crappy
culture, and they're not

00:07:35.030 --> 00:07:36.950
going to perform well.

00:07:36.950 --> 00:07:39.920
Or I can have a great culture
and hire the wrong people.

00:07:39.920 --> 00:07:41.400
They're not going
to perform well.

00:07:41.400 --> 00:07:43.770
So this is really going
to focus on-- this talk--

00:07:43.770 --> 00:07:45.470
on organization and on purpose.

00:07:45.470 --> 00:07:47.450
And I'll come back to
purpose at the end.

00:07:47.450 --> 00:07:50.000
So I want to push on to
two of those three levers

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:53.030
today, see what
we get out of it.

00:07:53.030 --> 00:07:56.730
So here's the model we've
come from, from the dozen

00:07:56.730 --> 00:07:58.722
years of studies.

00:07:58.722 --> 00:08:00.930
And I should say, these
studies include field studies

00:08:00.930 --> 00:08:01.770
at for profits.

00:08:01.770 --> 00:08:05.220
So come in, take blood, measure
neurologic activity a variety

00:08:05.220 --> 00:08:06.469
of ways from people at work.

00:08:06.469 --> 00:08:08.510
And so not only does this
work in the laboratory,

00:08:08.510 --> 00:08:09.790
it works in the field.

00:08:09.790 --> 00:08:16.240
So we identified eight
classes of policies

00:08:16.240 --> 00:08:19.140
that you can push on in
your organization that

00:08:19.140 --> 00:08:20.620
can raise trust.

00:08:20.620 --> 00:08:24.070
Somehow, magically, those
eight class of policies

00:08:24.070 --> 00:08:28.330
have an easy to remember
acronym, oxytocin.

00:08:28.330 --> 00:08:29.580
I don't know how that worked.

00:08:29.580 --> 00:08:32.360
So if I push on these oxytocin
factors, one or more of them,

00:08:32.360 --> 00:08:34.419
I'm going to get more trust.

00:08:34.419 --> 00:08:36.620
The science predicts that
when I have trust combined

00:08:36.620 --> 00:08:38.570
with a sense of
purpose, what I call

00:08:38.570 --> 00:08:41.440
transcendent purpose-- I'll talk
about that in a minute-- then

00:08:41.440 --> 00:08:45.660
I get more engagement at work
from these volunteer employees,

00:08:45.660 --> 00:08:47.370
greater customer service.

00:08:47.370 --> 00:08:51.740
And an outcome of that
is that I just dig it.

00:08:51.740 --> 00:08:53.810
It's fun now.

00:08:53.810 --> 00:08:55.610
There's still some
drag parts of work,

00:08:55.610 --> 00:08:57.920
but by and large,
I love what we do.

00:08:57.920 --> 00:08:59.620
I love the people I work with.

00:08:59.620 --> 00:09:03.530
And I'm just knocking it out
of the park all the time.

00:09:03.530 --> 00:09:05.420
So when I have high
performance, then I

00:09:05.420 --> 00:09:07.050
generate this feedback
loop, which is,

00:09:07.050 --> 00:09:09.715
now it's more fun come to work
because we're knocking it out

00:09:09.715 --> 00:09:11.950
of the park a lot of the days.

00:09:11.950 --> 00:09:14.400
Maybe not every day,
but a lot of times.

00:09:14.400 --> 00:09:16.680
Man, we had home run yesterday.

00:09:16.680 --> 00:09:17.540
That was awesome.

00:09:18.510 --> 00:09:20.520
So how do I create that
environment in which,

00:09:20.520 --> 00:09:23.909
again, even if I didn't pay
you, you still want to show up.

00:09:23.909 --> 00:09:25.950
So I'm going to go through
each of those oxytocin

00:09:25.950 --> 00:09:28.350
factors in some detail.

00:09:28.350 --> 00:09:30.275
Not too much detail,
because I have an hour.

00:09:30.275 --> 00:09:31.900
Give you an example
of a company that's

00:09:31.900 --> 00:09:33.300
been doing this very well.

00:09:33.300 --> 00:09:35.020
And at the end,
talk about how that

00:09:35.020 --> 00:09:37.480
relates to outcome
measures based

00:09:37.480 --> 00:09:39.950
on a sample of about
5,000 employees

00:09:39.950 --> 00:09:41.960
from companies around the globe.

00:09:41.960 --> 00:09:43.210
So here are the eight factors.

00:09:46.660 --> 00:09:51.030
So once you have those factors,
how do you manage that?

00:09:55.330 --> 00:09:58.430
Second confession of the talk.

00:09:58.430 --> 00:10:01.830
As you guys know from that
nice video from Morgan Freeman,

00:10:01.830 --> 00:10:04.009
I am a brilliant scientist.

00:10:04.009 --> 00:10:05.300
I think of everything to study.

00:10:05.300 --> 00:10:05.660
No.

00:10:05.660 --> 00:10:08.035
I don't know what I'm doing
half the time, like you guys.

00:10:08.035 --> 00:10:09.980
I'm just trying to
figure it out as I go.

00:10:09.980 --> 00:10:12.530
So I actually had an
organization come to me

00:10:12.530 --> 00:10:14.540
some years ago and
say, hey, we think

00:10:14.540 --> 00:10:16.060
trust is really important.

00:10:16.060 --> 00:10:19.650
Could you help us understand
trust in our organization?

00:10:19.650 --> 00:10:20.690
And I said, oh, yeah.

00:10:20.690 --> 00:10:21.606
I'll be happy to come.

00:10:21.606 --> 00:10:24.140
I'll bring my needles and
my centrifuges and dry ice.

00:10:24.140 --> 00:10:25.720
They're like, oh, no.

00:10:25.720 --> 00:10:28.416
They said, is there some
of the way you can do that?

00:10:28.416 --> 00:10:29.610
I start thinking, oh, yeah.

00:10:29.610 --> 00:10:31.730
We know a lot about
this brain system

00:10:31.730 --> 00:10:34.469
that allows us to trust
other people quite rapidly.

00:10:34.469 --> 00:10:36.260
Oxytocin release happens
in a second or two

00:10:36.260 --> 00:10:39.440
after you interact with somebody
if it's a positive interaction.

00:10:39.440 --> 00:10:41.360
So we know a lot
about that system.

00:10:41.360 --> 00:10:43.300
How do we turn that
down into a tool?

00:10:43.300 --> 00:10:46.790
So we developed the
survey we O Factor

00:10:46.790 --> 00:10:50.070
which allows us
to quantify trust

00:10:50.070 --> 00:10:53.560
with an organization and
these eight classes of factors

00:10:53.560 --> 00:10:55.150
that produce it.

00:10:55.150 --> 00:10:57.555
That tool also allows us
to measure things like joy

00:10:57.555 --> 00:10:58.540
at work.

00:10:58.540 --> 00:11:02.190
So we're going to use that
tool to then seek to measure

00:11:02.190 --> 00:11:04.110
what we want to manage.

00:11:04.110 --> 00:11:05.250
That makes sense?

00:11:05.250 --> 00:11:07.000
So let me go through
these again, briefly.

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:10.010
And we'll have plenty of
time for questions too.

00:11:10.010 --> 00:11:13.100
So the first is ovation.

00:11:13.100 --> 00:11:14.910
This meaning
recognizing excellence.

00:11:18.090 --> 00:11:20.720
Someone in the room's
going to think, gosh,

00:11:20.720 --> 00:11:22.780
day one in business
school at Stanford

00:11:22.780 --> 00:11:25.330
and we talked about
recognizing people.

00:11:25.330 --> 00:11:26.030
That's not new.

00:11:26.030 --> 00:11:26.530
Oh, no.

00:11:26.530 --> 00:11:28.154
Here's where the
neuroscience comes in.

00:11:28.154 --> 00:11:30.755
Neuroscience has very
specific predictions

00:11:30.755 --> 00:11:34.280
on how to get the most
out of recognition.

00:11:34.280 --> 00:11:38.220
In particular, recognition
that is personal.

00:11:38.220 --> 00:11:40.150
That is tangible.

00:11:40.150 --> 00:11:43.470
That happens close in time when
the goal is met or exceeded,

00:11:43.470 --> 00:11:46.020
and no more than a
week after happens.

00:11:46.020 --> 00:11:46.690
That's public.

00:11:46.690 --> 00:11:48.610
That's unexpected.

00:11:48.610 --> 00:11:50.090
So you guys don't have this.

00:11:50.090 --> 00:11:52.690
But these businesses that have
employee of the month parking

00:11:52.690 --> 00:11:53.190
place.

00:11:55.410 --> 00:11:56.287
OK, I guess.

00:11:56.287 --> 00:11:57.870
But basically everyone
gets it, right?

00:11:57.870 --> 00:11:59.280
Move it around.

00:11:59.280 --> 00:12:02.980
But instead, for Eric
who I know loves coffee,

00:12:02.980 --> 00:12:04.840
his team just
nailed this project.

00:12:04.840 --> 00:12:06.862
They were working for
three months, killed it.

00:12:06.862 --> 00:12:09.070
And then we come into our
all hands meeting on Monday

00:12:09.070 --> 00:12:12.680
and I bring him a great gift
basket of really great coffee

00:12:12.680 --> 00:12:14.550
and a nice mug.

00:12:14.550 --> 00:12:15.660
Because I know him, right?

00:12:15.660 --> 00:12:17.790
And I'm invested in him.

00:12:17.790 --> 00:12:20.490
So what happens during
ovations is that not only do we

00:12:20.490 --> 00:12:23.370
recognize the team
for doing well,

00:12:23.370 --> 00:12:25.800
you have an opportunity
for a debrief.

00:12:25.800 --> 00:12:28.160
So Eric, you guys
just killed it.

00:12:28.160 --> 00:12:29.747
Tell us about the project.

00:12:29.747 --> 00:12:30.330
What happened?

00:12:30.330 --> 00:12:30.996
What went right?

00:12:30.996 --> 00:12:31.820
What went wrong?

00:12:31.820 --> 00:12:32.350
Say, oh, you know what?

00:12:32.350 --> 00:12:34.220
We were working on this and we
thought we're going to do this,

00:12:34.220 --> 00:12:36.480
but then we found out
that stuff didn't work.

00:12:36.480 --> 00:12:38.110
So then we pivoted
and we did this.

00:12:38.110 --> 00:12:40.250
And then three days
before it was done,

00:12:40.250 --> 00:12:42.650
the servers crashed and then
we had to find the backups

00:12:42.650 --> 00:12:45.742
and then Tori worked super late
and she worked til midnight

00:12:45.742 --> 00:12:47.200
and she saved all
the data and then

00:12:47.200 --> 00:12:49.480
we got the project done on time.

00:12:49.480 --> 00:12:52.390
So we just got a
chance to do a debrief.

00:12:52.390 --> 00:12:54.170
Not only on what
goes right, but what

00:12:54.170 --> 00:12:56.250
happens when things go wrong.

00:12:56.250 --> 00:12:59.520
So ovation is both recognizing
the individual and the team,

00:12:59.520 --> 00:13:02.260
but also identifying
what do we do?

00:13:02.260 --> 00:13:03.820
What's best practice?

00:13:03.820 --> 00:13:06.390
Let's discover best practice.

00:13:06.390 --> 00:13:08.480
It also creates aspirations.

00:13:08.480 --> 00:13:12.560
So Barbara's team would
like to be recognized.

00:13:12.560 --> 00:13:15.930
So when her project
comes up, yeah.

00:13:15.930 --> 00:13:17.960
Saying, oh yeah,
that's pretty cool.

00:13:17.960 --> 00:13:21.540
Everyone clapping for Eric's
team and it was great.

00:13:21.540 --> 00:13:23.120
So you're building
up this culture

00:13:23.120 --> 00:13:25.330
that says we recognize you.

00:13:25.330 --> 00:13:27.764
We recognize that you
are working very hard.

00:13:27.764 --> 00:13:30.180
We recognize you're putting
your heart and soul into this,

00:13:30.180 --> 00:13:32.930
and we want to recognize
that it's valuable.

00:13:32.930 --> 00:13:35.260
We recognize it as a
group that it's valuable.

00:13:35.260 --> 00:13:37.900
And we want to use
the implications

00:13:37.900 --> 00:13:41.310
of the neuroscience
to get the biggest

00:13:41.310 --> 00:13:44.865
neurologic impact and therefore
the biggest behavioral impact.

00:13:44.865 --> 00:13:47.240
And there's lots behind this
I'm not going to talk about,

00:13:47.240 --> 00:13:50.300
but this sets up pathways in
the brain that essentially

00:13:50.300 --> 00:13:51.870
make you crave that.

00:13:51.870 --> 00:13:53.480
I want to be recognized.

00:13:53.480 --> 00:13:54.260
I'm working hard.

00:13:54.260 --> 00:13:55.468
Even the introverts, like me.

00:13:55.468 --> 00:13:57.250
We want to be
recognized occasionally.

00:13:57.250 --> 00:13:59.286
So yeah, you were great.

00:13:59.286 --> 00:13:59.910
That's awesome.

00:14:02.570 --> 00:14:04.570
Number two is expectation.

00:14:04.570 --> 00:14:06.320
This is designing
challenges at work.

00:14:06.320 --> 00:14:08.095
You guys know a lot about this.

00:14:08.095 --> 00:14:09.970
Oh, by the way, I'm
putting the data up.

00:14:09.970 --> 00:14:14.520
So the values here are how
much of each of these factors--

00:14:14.520 --> 00:14:16.920
how much they explain
organizational trust.

00:14:16.920 --> 00:14:18.540
All those factors
are not independent.

00:14:18.540 --> 00:14:19.660
There's some overlap.

00:14:19.660 --> 00:14:22.420
So they sum to more than
one because of that.

00:14:22.420 --> 00:14:26.430
So expectation explains 70%
of organizational trust.

00:14:26.430 --> 00:14:30.420
So again, from the science,
if I want to create challenges

00:14:30.420 --> 00:14:35.240
at work, those challenges have
to enable what psychologists

00:14:35.240 --> 00:14:36.900
call challenge stress.

00:14:36.900 --> 00:14:38.660
I want to put you
in a situation where

00:14:38.660 --> 00:14:40.040
you know what you need to do.

00:14:40.040 --> 00:14:42.230
You know when it's
going to be over.

00:14:42.230 --> 00:14:43.430
You have very clear goals.

00:14:43.430 --> 00:14:45.310
The outcomes are concrete.

00:14:45.310 --> 00:14:47.880
What I don't what
to do is move you

00:14:47.880 --> 00:14:50.690
into a chronic stress state.

00:14:50.690 --> 00:14:52.750
So chronic stress,
we know, inhibits

00:14:52.750 --> 00:14:54.090
the release of oxytocin.

00:14:54.090 --> 00:14:55.350
Puts you in survival mode.

00:14:55.350 --> 00:14:56.810
Now I pull inward.

00:14:56.810 --> 00:14:58.880
Just try to get through
the next 10 minutes.

00:14:58.880 --> 00:15:01.060
I'm not worried about
organizing my team focus.

00:15:01.060 --> 00:15:03.590
I want to get you on
the challenge stress,

00:15:03.590 --> 00:15:05.740
like when I went skydiving.

00:15:05.740 --> 00:15:08.440
If you guys have ever done
this, you are super focused,

00:15:08.440 --> 00:15:10.470
particularly the first time.

00:15:10.470 --> 00:15:12.880
The instructor says, you
need to do these three

00:15:12.880 --> 00:15:15.970
things to get out of
the plane safely and get

00:15:15.970 --> 00:15:18.720
in position so we don't
tumble out and you know--

00:15:18.720 --> 00:15:19.627
OK.

00:15:19.627 --> 00:15:20.710
I know those three things.

00:15:20.710 --> 00:15:21.810
I'm saying it over and over.

00:15:21.810 --> 00:15:22.309
OK.

00:15:22.309 --> 00:15:23.640
Do this, arch your back, OK.

00:15:23.640 --> 00:15:24.950
I got it.

00:15:24.950 --> 00:15:27.760
So what you didn't
see is that I had

00:15:27.760 --> 00:15:30.991
a graduate student who was also
a skydiving instructor with me.

00:15:30.991 --> 00:15:32.990
And before we jumped, he
gave me cognitive tests

00:15:32.990 --> 00:15:34.240
and I couldn't do them at all.

00:15:34.240 --> 00:15:35.720
On the ground, I was cool.

00:15:35.720 --> 00:15:38.540
And when I came back
down, I was fine.

00:15:38.540 --> 00:15:41.120
So I was highly focused on task.

00:15:41.120 --> 00:15:43.770
So when I design
challenges, these concrete,

00:15:43.770 --> 00:15:46.500
difficult, but
achievable challenges,

00:15:46.500 --> 00:15:48.672
your brain gets rid
of distractions.

00:15:48.672 --> 00:15:49.630
You're focused on task.

00:15:49.630 --> 00:15:51.130
I'm not watching cat videos.

00:15:51.130 --> 00:15:54.390
I'm not answering
unimportant emails.

00:15:54.390 --> 00:15:56.470
I have a reason
to come together.

00:15:56.470 --> 00:15:59.180
So for this oxytocin
trust system to work,

00:15:59.180 --> 00:16:02.040
I need a reason to marshal
those social resources.

00:16:02.040 --> 00:16:04.650
So moderate stress,
as challenge stress

00:16:04.650 --> 00:16:06.550
promotes release of oxytocin.

00:16:06.550 --> 00:16:08.210
I need to depend on Simon.

00:16:08.210 --> 00:16:09.140
He's part of my team.

00:16:09.140 --> 00:16:10.270
I have no choice.

00:16:10.270 --> 00:16:11.910
Our project's due in two weeks.

00:16:11.910 --> 00:16:12.630
I need his input.

00:16:12.630 --> 00:16:14.312
I got to engage with him.

00:16:14.312 --> 00:16:16.270
And he's going to do an
important part of that.

00:16:16.270 --> 00:16:18.984
If I can't engage with
him, the project's

00:16:18.984 --> 00:16:20.150
not going to work out right.

00:16:20.150 --> 00:16:22.690
So I have a real
incentive to do that.

00:16:22.690 --> 00:16:25.400
Now, what happens when
I finish the project?

00:16:25.400 --> 00:16:26.290
Go back to step one.

00:16:26.290 --> 00:16:28.030
Now we have an ovation.

00:16:28.030 --> 00:16:30.490
So from the neuroscience,
it's very important

00:16:30.490 --> 00:16:32.590
that after I put you
under challenge stress

00:16:32.590 --> 00:16:34.910
that you have a
refractory period.

00:16:34.910 --> 00:16:37.730
So you probably know
this, but the brain

00:16:37.730 --> 00:16:38.960
is very much like a muscle.

00:16:38.960 --> 00:16:39.990
It gets fatigued.

00:16:39.990 --> 00:16:41.860
The neurons actually
get fatigued.

00:16:41.860 --> 00:16:45.030
So when you've been going,
going, going, what I want to do

00:16:45.030 --> 00:16:47.640
is when you finish the
project on Friday, on Monday

00:16:47.640 --> 00:16:50.790
not say, here's the next
giant thing you got to do.

00:16:50.790 --> 00:16:52.214
Monday, let's celebrate.

00:16:52.214 --> 00:16:52.880
Let's have cake.

00:16:52.880 --> 00:16:55.580
Let's take half a day
off and go to-- what's

00:16:55.580 --> 00:16:56.930
over here-- Great America.

00:16:56.930 --> 00:16:57.900
Hang out.

00:16:57.900 --> 00:16:59.470
I'm going to buy
you tickets to that.

00:16:59.470 --> 00:17:00.636
Let's have this down period.

00:17:00.636 --> 00:17:01.510
Catch up on email.

00:17:01.510 --> 00:17:02.720
Go home at a regular time.

00:17:02.720 --> 00:17:04.760
Then maybe Wednesday or
Thursday or next Monday,

00:17:04.760 --> 00:17:07.260
I'm going to give you a big new
project to start working on.

00:17:07.260 --> 00:17:09.859
So we need a little
bit of down time just

00:17:09.859 --> 00:17:11.210
to figure out what we did.

00:17:11.210 --> 00:17:12.560
Again, internally debrief.

00:17:12.560 --> 00:17:14.270
Maybe debrief on paper.

00:17:14.270 --> 00:17:15.400
Share that information.

00:17:15.400 --> 00:17:17.170
Then move on to the
next big challenge.

00:17:17.170 --> 00:17:20.790
So it can't just be challenge,
challenge, challenge.

00:17:20.790 --> 00:17:23.480
Third component
is called yields.

00:17:23.480 --> 00:17:26.950
Explains 57% of
organizational trust.

00:17:26.950 --> 00:17:29.910
So this is something I think
Google does very well as well.

00:17:29.910 --> 00:17:31.710
Crowd sourcing processes.

00:17:31.710 --> 00:17:34.360
So you can think of
it as delegation.

00:17:34.360 --> 00:17:36.187
So we have this project.

00:17:36.187 --> 00:17:37.270
Here's what we want to do.

00:17:37.270 --> 00:17:38.250
We have concrete goals.

00:17:38.250 --> 00:17:40.880
I've set expectations,
I as a supervisor.

00:17:40.880 --> 00:17:42.780
I want to recognize
you when you finish it.

00:17:42.780 --> 00:17:44.238
I'm going to give
you the resources

00:17:44.238 --> 00:17:45.580
you need to be successful.

00:17:45.580 --> 00:17:48.397
But I don't want to
tell you how to do it.

00:17:48.397 --> 00:17:49.730
I don't want to micromanage you.

00:17:49.730 --> 00:17:53.270
If I micromanage you, I'm
going to inhibit innovation.

00:17:53.270 --> 00:17:55.630
That's why you hire
people like you hire.

00:17:55.630 --> 00:18:00.270
I want to allow you to have some
deviation from what's expected,

00:18:00.270 --> 00:18:01.920
and I hope that's a
positive deviation.

00:18:01.920 --> 00:18:03.417
Sometimes it's a negative.

00:18:03.417 --> 00:18:05.250
And for that, we want
to put a floor, right?

00:18:05.250 --> 00:18:08.310
We want to minimize the
bad outcomes and certainly

00:18:08.310 --> 00:18:09.360
catastrophic losses.

00:18:09.360 --> 00:18:12.600
But I want to allow for
positive deviations.

00:18:12.600 --> 00:18:16.130
So when you practice
yield, there's

00:18:16.130 --> 00:18:18.190
greater buy-in from
the people in the group

00:18:18.190 --> 00:18:20.180
because now they
own the project.

00:18:20.180 --> 00:18:22.910
Instead of me telling you how
to do it, me the supervisor,

00:18:22.910 --> 00:18:24.040
you guys own it.

00:18:24.040 --> 00:18:24.730
Figure it out.

00:18:24.730 --> 00:18:25.620
You're smart.

00:18:25.620 --> 00:18:26.661
You're working at Google.

00:18:26.661 --> 00:18:27.760
You're super smart.

00:18:27.760 --> 00:18:29.290
Here's the thing
we're trying to do.

00:18:29.290 --> 00:18:30.140
Make it gorgeous.

00:18:30.140 --> 00:18:31.250
Make it beautiful.

00:18:31.250 --> 00:18:33.220
Here's what you need to finish.

00:18:33.220 --> 00:18:35.726
Here's the deadline.

00:18:35.726 --> 00:18:36.225
Go.

00:18:36.225 --> 00:18:37.350
Go do it.

00:18:37.350 --> 00:18:39.820
So again, very engaging.

00:18:39.820 --> 00:18:42.330
A lot of organizations want
to micromanage because they

00:18:42.330 --> 00:18:45.050
want to minimize mistakes.

00:18:45.050 --> 00:18:46.530
So we've actually
worked recently

00:18:46.530 --> 00:18:50.660
with hospitals that
will practice yield.

00:18:50.660 --> 00:18:53.520
If you're trained--
training's really key here.

00:18:53.520 --> 00:18:59.970
So I say train carefully
and delegate generously.

00:18:59.970 --> 00:19:02.680
So I want to really carefully
train you in a hospital.

00:19:02.680 --> 00:19:05.760
And then I actually want
my surgeon to be smart.

00:19:05.760 --> 00:19:07.790
Don't just be a robot.

00:19:07.790 --> 00:19:10.490
If you see something
more unusual, yeah.

00:19:10.490 --> 00:19:11.220
Do a deviation.

00:19:11.220 --> 00:19:12.678
Change that procedure
if it's going

00:19:12.678 --> 00:19:15.124
to be a benefit to the patient.

00:19:15.124 --> 00:19:17.040
Or if it could save time
for the organization,

00:19:17.040 --> 00:19:19.520
or if it's improve outcomes.

00:19:19.520 --> 00:19:21.420
So I want to allow
that kind of deviation.

00:19:21.420 --> 00:19:23.260
But you have to
allow for mistakes.

00:19:23.260 --> 00:19:25.280
So one way to do
this is-- I don't

00:19:25.280 --> 00:19:27.780
know if you do this here-- but
you could celebrate mistakes.

00:19:27.780 --> 00:19:31.200
You could have a,
yay, we screwed up

00:19:31.200 --> 00:19:33.390
celebration or ovation.

00:19:33.390 --> 00:19:35.495
Unless you are willing
to accept that people

00:19:35.495 --> 00:19:36.870
are going to make
mistakes, which

00:19:36.870 --> 00:19:39.050
is how you get innovation.

00:19:39.050 --> 00:19:41.460
So I think even
though we often say,

00:19:41.460 --> 00:19:44.370
like we tell kids, oh, everyone
learns from their mistakes,

00:19:44.370 --> 00:19:44.870
honey.

00:19:44.870 --> 00:19:46.050
It's OK.

00:19:46.050 --> 00:19:48.670
Sometimes at work we say
but we don't really do it.

00:19:48.670 --> 00:19:53.666
So think about some crazy ways
to celebrate the big fails.

00:19:53.666 --> 00:19:55.290
If you're going to
get big wins, you're

00:19:55.290 --> 00:19:56.740
going to get some big fails.

00:19:56.740 --> 00:19:59.073
And again, you want to pull
the plug on those big fails,

00:19:59.073 --> 00:20:00.990
not have catastrophic errors.

00:20:00.990 --> 00:20:03.420
We don't want anybody to die.

00:20:03.420 --> 00:20:06.222
But besides that, yeah,
we wasted a bunch of time

00:20:06.222 --> 00:20:07.180
and we learned a bunch.

00:20:07.180 --> 00:20:08.299
This is not how we do it.

00:20:08.299 --> 00:20:09.340
That's valuable learning.

00:20:09.340 --> 00:20:12.520
So let's celebrate that.

00:20:12.520 --> 00:20:15.030
Next up is what I call transfer.

00:20:15.030 --> 00:20:18.260
This is like yield on steroids.

00:20:18.260 --> 00:20:20.660
So this is a role
in which instead

00:20:20.660 --> 00:20:23.550
of saying I'm going to
assign work to Simon's group,

00:20:23.550 --> 00:20:26.290
I want to ask what group
would like to do this project.

00:20:26.290 --> 00:20:29.570
So this is really
enabling self management.

00:20:29.570 --> 00:20:31.890
I should say as an
aside, I have a picture

00:20:31.890 --> 00:20:34.340
here of Peter Drucker who is
my colleague, late colleague,

00:20:34.340 --> 00:20:37.340
at Claremont for 10 years.

00:20:37.340 --> 00:20:40.560
And the last article Peter
wrote for the "Harvard Business

00:20:40.560 --> 00:20:44.090
Review" was called
"Managing Oneself."

00:20:44.090 --> 00:20:48.560
And in that article he
basically argued in the mid '90s

00:20:48.560 --> 00:20:51.560
that we are all our own brands.

00:20:51.560 --> 00:20:54.890
If you are your own brand, why
am I assigning work to you?

00:20:54.890 --> 00:20:57.080
Why don't I allow you
to manage yourself?

00:20:57.080 --> 00:20:59.580
So if you can do this, you can
cut out layers of management.

00:20:59.580 --> 00:21:01.800
Again, I think Google's got
a very flat organization.

00:21:01.800 --> 00:21:03.210
It works quite well.

00:21:03.210 --> 00:21:05.670
Many organizations do not.

00:21:05.670 --> 00:21:09.650
We worked with a company
in the Central Valley

00:21:09.650 --> 00:21:11.160
called Morning
Star Tomato, which

00:21:11.160 --> 00:21:14.210
is one of the best run
companies you've never heard of.

00:21:14.210 --> 00:21:16.700
It's the largest producer
of tomato products,

00:21:16.700 --> 00:21:20.530
stewed tomatoes, steamed
tomato, tomato paste, in the US.

00:21:20.530 --> 00:21:22.990
About half the US
market because they're

00:21:22.990 --> 00:21:24.940
extraordinarily efficient.

00:21:24.940 --> 00:21:26.260
About 1,500 employees.

00:21:26.260 --> 00:21:29.090
There are no job titles.

00:21:29.090 --> 00:21:31.470
And 80% of these are
seasonal, by the way.

00:21:31.470 --> 00:21:34.574
So you're hired for the
picking processing season.

00:21:34.574 --> 00:21:36.240
How can you get away
with no job titles?

00:21:36.240 --> 00:21:39.410
You have to write essentially
a value proposition every year.

00:21:39.410 --> 00:21:41.779
I want to join Barbara's group.

00:21:41.779 --> 00:21:43.320
Here's how I'm going
to create value.

00:21:46.160 --> 00:21:48.360
Valve Software up in
Seattle does this.

00:21:48.360 --> 00:21:49.712
You have desks on wheels.

00:21:49.712 --> 00:21:50.420
You join a group.

00:21:50.420 --> 00:21:52.016
You say, look, I want
to work on your group.

00:21:52.016 --> 00:21:54.280
You guys are doing cool
stuff, and I have these skills

00:21:54.280 --> 00:21:55.510
I think I can contribute.

00:21:55.510 --> 00:21:57.330
And they say, eh, maybe.

00:21:57.330 --> 00:21:57.830
OK.

00:21:57.830 --> 00:21:58.450
Show up.

00:21:58.450 --> 00:21:59.870
We'll see if you're useful.

00:21:59.870 --> 00:22:02.130
So just allow people
to self manage,

00:22:02.130 --> 00:22:04.240
and then you can
have ultimate buy-in.

00:22:04.240 --> 00:22:05.240
Now you own the project.

00:22:05.240 --> 00:22:08.090
Now it's really yours.

00:22:08.090 --> 00:22:12.130
So again, in some sense
this is a key sign of trust.

00:22:12.130 --> 00:22:14.730
Instead of me now
saying, hey, we

00:22:14.730 --> 00:22:17.930
got this project that's
coming in, you do it.

00:22:17.930 --> 00:22:20.520
I'm actually allowing you
to choose when you do it.

00:22:23.030 --> 00:22:24.350
So I run a 30 person lab.

00:22:24.350 --> 00:22:28.390
So that's my little laboratory
to try all this out.

00:22:28.390 --> 00:22:30.041
Sometimes what we
find is that people

00:22:30.041 --> 00:22:32.290
don't want to be what we
call "primaries" on projects.

00:22:32.290 --> 00:22:34.290
They don't want to pick
up and run that project.

00:22:34.290 --> 00:22:36.415
So sometimes I have
to say, hey, Eric.

00:22:36.415 --> 00:22:37.650
It's time.

00:22:37.650 --> 00:22:39.250
You've been here a year.

00:22:39.250 --> 00:22:40.390
You're trained.

00:22:40.390 --> 00:22:42.664
I think you should be
primary on this project.

00:22:42.664 --> 00:22:44.080
And we'll build a
team around you.

00:22:44.080 --> 00:22:45.288
We'll give you the resources.

00:22:45.288 --> 00:22:46.830
We'll make sure
you're successful.

00:22:46.830 --> 00:22:50.200
And I as a supervisor need to
do constant feedback loops.

00:22:50.200 --> 00:22:53.540
So the supervisor's role
is to do constant feedback.

00:22:53.540 --> 00:22:55.830
The slowest you want to
do that is once a week.

00:22:55.830 --> 00:22:57.580
After a week from the
brain's perspective,

00:22:57.580 --> 00:22:59.810
it's like it's forever.

00:22:59.810 --> 00:23:01.440
Never happened.

00:23:01.440 --> 00:23:02.890
So constant feedback.

00:23:02.890 --> 00:23:04.030
How's your project going.

00:23:04.030 --> 00:23:05.405
Let's do a Monday
morning huddle.

00:23:05.405 --> 00:23:06.863
Do you have the
resources you need?

00:23:06.863 --> 00:23:08.289
Are you hitting your milestones?

00:23:08.289 --> 00:23:09.080
What's going right?

00:23:09.080 --> 00:23:10.160
What's going wrong?

00:23:10.160 --> 00:23:12.220
What do you need from
me to be successful?

00:23:12.220 --> 00:23:15.890
If I'm in that role, this
coaching role as supervisor,

00:23:15.890 --> 00:23:17.730
then my job is to
make you look good.

00:23:17.730 --> 00:23:19.880
And when you look
good, I look good.

00:23:19.880 --> 00:23:22.409
But you've got buy-in
because you own this project.

00:23:22.409 --> 00:23:23.450
You bid for this project.

00:23:23.450 --> 00:23:25.330
You love this project.

00:23:25.330 --> 00:23:27.890
So there's lots of literature
in psychology on what's

00:23:27.890 --> 00:23:29.490
called locus of control.

00:23:29.490 --> 00:23:34.650
Improves engagement, but also
things like health, happiness.

00:23:34.650 --> 00:23:38.185
Next component I call openness.

00:23:38.185 --> 00:23:42.890
This is a way to reduce
the amount of stress that

00:23:42.890 --> 00:23:44.200
inhibits trust.

00:23:44.200 --> 00:23:50.630
So if I'm thinking the guys
upstairs are doing stuff

00:23:50.630 --> 00:23:51.570
I don't know about.

00:23:51.570 --> 00:23:54.190
They're going to
sell off my division.

00:23:54.190 --> 00:23:59.010
They're going to move
Google to Costa Rica.

00:23:59.010 --> 00:24:01.780
If I have that kind of stress,
I'm not focused on task.

00:24:01.780 --> 00:24:05.010
I'm not focused on meeting this
challenge that I need to meet.

00:24:05.010 --> 00:24:07.800
So why not just
open everything up?

00:24:07.800 --> 00:24:10.459
So I know you have a fairly
transparent culture here.

00:24:10.459 --> 00:24:12.000
There are lots of
companies that have

00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:16.310
gone to radical transparency
where salaries are public.

00:24:16.310 --> 00:24:18.254
Performance data is public.

00:24:18.254 --> 00:24:18.920
Everybody knows.

00:24:18.920 --> 00:24:19.800
It's scary.

00:24:19.800 --> 00:24:20.950
So I tried it in my lap.

00:24:20.950 --> 00:24:23.400
So we do project based work.

00:24:23.400 --> 00:24:25.384
On that project base,
people have hourly wages

00:24:25.384 --> 00:24:27.300
and it's not so hard to
do some multiplication

00:24:27.300 --> 00:24:29.300
and find out what
my annual salary is.

00:24:29.300 --> 00:24:31.160
So I finally just
put it out there.

00:24:31.160 --> 00:24:33.810
Here's what I do, the
stuff you guys don't see.

00:24:33.810 --> 00:24:36.300
I got to travel, go to
Google, it's terrible.

00:24:36.300 --> 00:24:37.800
I got to go to these places.

00:24:37.800 --> 00:24:39.950
So I don't see my
little kids at home.

00:24:39.950 --> 00:24:43.230
So this is why-- and I'm years
and years of doing this-- this

00:24:43.230 --> 00:24:45.230
is why I get this salary.

00:24:45.230 --> 00:24:48.180
So it allows us to
have that discussion.

00:24:48.180 --> 00:24:50.235
Eric's been doing
this for seven years.

00:24:50.235 --> 00:24:51.360
He has a different salary.

00:24:51.360 --> 00:24:52.180
He has less experience.

00:24:52.180 --> 00:24:53.610
He's doing different
set of jobs.

00:24:53.610 --> 00:24:54.810
He doesn't have to travel.

00:24:54.810 --> 00:24:57.750
So it actually opens up
that really interesting

00:24:57.750 --> 00:24:58.740
conversation.

00:24:58.740 --> 00:25:02.382
And pretty much everybody knew
what salaries were anyway.

00:25:02.382 --> 00:25:04.090
In the world we live
in now, everything's

00:25:04.090 --> 00:25:05.131
more or less transparent.

00:25:05.131 --> 00:25:07.950
So I think there's
real opportunity

00:25:07.950 --> 00:25:10.460
to be completely transparent
about what you're doing

00:25:10.460 --> 00:25:12.326
and say look, we trust you guys.

00:25:12.326 --> 00:25:13.950
So, for example,
Whole Foods does this.

00:25:13.950 --> 00:25:17.521
They send out quarterly
profit and loss statements

00:25:17.521 --> 00:25:18.520
to all of the employees.

00:25:18.520 --> 00:25:20.380
They give them classes
on how to read them.

00:25:20.380 --> 00:25:21.838
So you know how
your store's doing,

00:25:21.838 --> 00:25:23.930
how the division you
work in is doing.

00:25:23.930 --> 00:25:25.910
They really empower
division managers

00:25:25.910 --> 00:25:27.920
to choose what
they want to stock,

00:25:27.920 --> 00:25:29.520
choose what suppliers they use.

00:25:29.520 --> 00:25:32.000
And so each department
within Whole Foods

00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:33.802
is essentially a
little autonomous unit.

00:25:33.802 --> 00:25:35.510
You got to hold together
and your store's

00:25:35.510 --> 00:25:39.120
got to be cash positive
most of the time or else

00:25:39.120 --> 00:25:40.640
you're out of
business and that's

00:25:40.640 --> 00:25:42.447
a bad thing for everybody.

00:25:42.447 --> 00:25:44.655
But you're going to run that
as your own little unit.

00:25:44.655 --> 00:25:46.279
We're going to give
you lots of control

00:25:46.279 --> 00:25:48.800
and then give you feedback
on how you doing and revenues

00:25:48.800 --> 00:25:49.600
feedback.

00:25:49.600 --> 00:25:52.630
There are lots of other
feedbacks as well.

00:25:52.630 --> 00:25:57.002
Who was it recently, CEO
who posted I guess McKinsey

00:25:57.002 --> 00:25:58.960
does this, where all the
senior people actually

00:25:58.960 --> 00:26:02.680
just posted their 360s
so everyone can see them.

00:26:02.680 --> 00:26:04.025
So you have to do 360s.

00:26:04.025 --> 00:26:04.900
You want to see mine?

00:26:04.900 --> 00:26:05.399
Yeah.

00:26:05.399 --> 00:26:06.566
Let's put them out there.

00:26:06.566 --> 00:26:07.650
So I have shortcomings?

00:26:07.650 --> 00:26:08.149
Sure.

00:26:08.149 --> 00:26:10.120
I'm a human.

00:26:10.120 --> 00:26:15.020
So a lot of this really is
taking a very humble view.

00:26:15.020 --> 00:26:17.775
I think sometimes when you're
a supervisor, when you're

00:26:17.775 --> 00:26:20.060
a founder, when you're
a senior person,

00:26:20.060 --> 00:26:22.080
there's a sense
that gosh, I have

00:26:22.080 --> 00:26:25.130
to be omniscient
about everything

00:26:25.130 --> 00:26:26.380
because I'm the boss.

00:26:26.380 --> 00:26:28.520
And I have to know everything.

00:26:28.520 --> 00:26:30.430
I think this approach
is very humble.

00:26:30.430 --> 00:26:34.665
It says, look, these volunteer
employees who are here,

00:26:34.665 --> 00:26:38.030
they're here because they want
to help your organization.

00:26:38.030 --> 00:26:39.790
Just ask for help.

00:26:39.790 --> 00:26:41.820
And being transparent is
a great way to do that.

00:26:41.820 --> 00:26:43.630
Just ask for help
rather than demand it.

00:26:46.970 --> 00:26:48.370
C is for caring.

00:26:48.370 --> 00:26:51.580
So as you saw in
that video, oxytocin

00:26:51.580 --> 00:26:53.850
facilitates appropriate
social behaviors

00:26:53.850 --> 00:26:56.310
by increasing our
sense of empathy.

00:26:56.310 --> 00:26:59.810
So when I have an understanding
of how people around me feel,

00:26:59.810 --> 00:27:02.440
I'm a much more effective
social creature.

00:27:02.440 --> 00:27:05.610
Again, sometimes at work we
think we should shut that off.

00:27:05.610 --> 00:27:07.260
But that was a great guy.

00:27:07.260 --> 00:27:08.510
I want to be friends with him.

00:27:08.510 --> 00:27:09.110
We work together.

00:27:09.110 --> 00:27:09.610
That's cool.

00:27:09.610 --> 00:27:11.140
I can still be friends with him.

00:27:11.140 --> 00:27:12.860
So why not just address that?

00:27:12.860 --> 00:27:15.361
That's the natural thing
for human beings to do.

00:27:15.361 --> 00:27:16.860
When you work
together, you're going

00:27:16.860 --> 00:27:18.290
to be friends with a
bunch of those people.

00:27:18.290 --> 00:27:18.730
It's OK.

00:27:18.730 --> 00:27:19.980
You can be friends with them.

00:27:19.980 --> 00:27:24.130
So an easy way to build
those social relationships

00:27:24.130 --> 00:27:27.030
is to just articulate
the emotion you see.

00:27:27.030 --> 00:27:28.730
So I come into work
and I see Barbara,

00:27:28.730 --> 00:27:30.060
and I say-- instead of
saying, hi, Barbara?

00:27:30.060 --> 00:27:30.430
How are you?

00:27:30.430 --> 00:27:30.680
I'm fine.

00:27:30.680 --> 00:27:31.190
How are you?

00:27:31.190 --> 00:27:32.100
Go to my desk.

00:27:32.100 --> 00:27:33.490
I say, hi.

00:27:33.490 --> 00:27:35.950
You look happy, sad, worried.

00:27:35.950 --> 00:27:37.960
Then we can have a much
deeper conversation.

00:27:37.960 --> 00:27:42.030
She can say, oh, you
know, I am feeling tired.

00:27:42.030 --> 00:27:43.840
Well, can I help you?

00:27:43.840 --> 00:27:45.215
Oh, well, my kids
have been sick.

00:27:45.215 --> 00:27:46.940
My dog died or whatever.

00:27:46.940 --> 00:27:48.800
Now we have a much
better conversation

00:27:48.800 --> 00:27:50.250
because I've
actually articulated

00:27:50.250 --> 00:27:51.460
the emotion I see in her.

00:27:51.460 --> 00:27:54.210
And it's an easy way to build
this caring relationship.

00:27:54.210 --> 00:27:55.435
Yeah, I do care about you.

00:27:55.435 --> 00:27:58.650
If I didn't, why are showing
up, since you're a volunteer.

00:28:01.560 --> 00:28:06.160
So it also means that you have
to allow your emotions to show.

00:28:06.160 --> 00:28:09.070
Son of an engineer, not
always the easiest thing.

00:28:09.070 --> 00:28:10.330
I'm with you guys.

00:28:10.330 --> 00:28:13.240
But if you allow those
emotions to show,

00:28:13.240 --> 00:28:15.990
then people will also
respond better to you.

00:28:15.990 --> 00:28:20.702
So part of this is really
having the confidence,

00:28:20.702 --> 00:28:22.410
having the trust in
the people around you

00:28:22.410 --> 00:28:24.368
that I can actually share
with how I'm feeling.

00:28:24.368 --> 00:28:27.510
So it I walk into work and
Barbara says, hey, gosh.

00:28:27.510 --> 00:28:29.780
You look like you're
having a great day.

00:28:29.780 --> 00:28:32.000
And I say, oh, whatever.

00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:33.335
Have we had a good relationship?

00:28:33.335 --> 00:28:33.970
No.

00:28:33.970 --> 00:28:35.710
So here's a concrete example.

00:28:35.710 --> 00:28:38.530
Woman in my lab a
year ago walks in.

00:28:38.530 --> 00:28:40.030
She is walking on air.

00:28:40.030 --> 00:28:42.340
I've known her for five
years, graduate student.

00:28:42.340 --> 00:28:45.996
I say, oh-- her name's
Beth-- Beth, what happened?

00:28:45.996 --> 00:28:46.870
Did you fall in love?

00:28:46.870 --> 00:28:48.350
Like, you look great.

00:28:48.350 --> 00:28:49.409
You're so happy.

00:28:49.409 --> 00:28:51.700
She said, you know, I started
running three months ago.

00:28:51.700 --> 00:28:53.460
I've lost 15 pounds.

00:28:53.460 --> 00:28:55.690
I'm going to do my first
triathlon in two weeks.

00:28:55.690 --> 00:28:58.470
I've never felt
better in my life.

00:28:58.470 --> 00:29:00.280
Thank you for recognizing this.

00:29:00.280 --> 00:29:03.394
And she has told me how many
times since then how important

00:29:03.394 --> 00:29:04.060
that was to her.

00:29:04.060 --> 00:29:06.559
That I actually just recognized
her as a human being, not as

00:29:06.559 --> 00:29:08.037
a human resource.

00:29:08.037 --> 00:29:09.120
Yeah, you work in the lab.

00:29:09.120 --> 00:29:10.869
And you're kind of a
slave, because you're

00:29:10.869 --> 00:29:11.700
a graduate student.

00:29:11.700 --> 00:29:13.830
But I recognize that
you're a full human being.

00:29:13.830 --> 00:29:15.451
You have a life outside of work.

00:29:15.451 --> 00:29:16.200
You have emotions.

00:29:16.200 --> 00:29:18.660
You have feelings,
and that's great.

00:29:18.660 --> 00:29:20.489
And I should embrace
all those if I

00:29:20.489 --> 00:29:22.030
want to be an
effective organization.

00:29:24.390 --> 00:29:24.890
All right.

00:29:24.890 --> 00:29:25.390
Two more.

00:29:25.390 --> 00:29:26.329
I is for invest.

00:29:26.329 --> 00:29:27.870
So it's very important
for the humans

00:29:27.870 --> 00:29:29.960
to have a sense of growth.

00:29:29.960 --> 00:29:33.270
So if you're using the
system I talked about so far,

00:29:33.270 --> 00:29:37.210
then you may have
had the insight

00:29:37.210 --> 00:29:41.520
that the annual performance
review is out the window.

00:29:41.520 --> 00:29:42.960
Don't need it.

00:29:42.960 --> 00:29:45.460
So we worked with the consulting
company in the Midwest that

00:29:45.460 --> 00:29:47.050
was going through some crises.

00:29:47.050 --> 00:29:48.990
And they started
using this system.

00:29:48.990 --> 00:29:50.400
Got rid of the annual report.

00:29:50.400 --> 00:29:52.620
At the town hall when
the CEO mentioned this,

00:29:52.620 --> 00:29:54.070
people erupted in applause.

00:29:54.070 --> 00:29:55.520
Everyone hates it.

00:29:55.520 --> 00:29:57.440
Supervisors hate it,
employees hate it.

00:29:57.440 --> 00:30:00.030
So I know you guys do much
more rapid performance review.

00:30:00.030 --> 00:30:03.600
So if I'm giving you feedback
at least once a week,

00:30:03.600 --> 00:30:06.460
clear goal celebrating
when you get wins.

00:30:06.460 --> 00:30:07.250
Helping you out.

00:30:07.250 --> 00:30:09.730
Even celebrating the
losses when it goes bad.

00:30:09.730 --> 00:30:10.730
Hey, it went back.

00:30:10.730 --> 00:30:11.230
Awesome.

00:30:11.230 --> 00:30:12.210
We learned some stuff.

00:30:12.210 --> 00:30:13.720
We're not going
to do that again.

00:30:13.720 --> 00:30:17.470
So if I'm doing that, then
this delayed look back

00:30:17.470 --> 00:30:20.700
at the last year or more of
what you did, it's useless.

00:30:20.700 --> 00:30:23.550
And again, from a brain
perspective, doesn't matter.

00:30:23.550 --> 00:30:26.240
So we created what we call
the whole person review which

00:30:26.240 --> 00:30:27.980
is forward looking.

00:30:27.980 --> 00:30:29.590
And because I'm
interested in you

00:30:29.590 --> 00:30:31.750
as a human being, not
as a human resource,

00:30:31.750 --> 00:30:33.660
that has three components.

00:30:33.660 --> 00:30:35.519
One is professional growth.

00:30:35.519 --> 00:30:37.810
I want to make sure that
you're growing professionally.

00:30:37.810 --> 00:30:40.490
So key question
there would be am I

00:30:40.490 --> 00:30:42.355
helping you get your next job?

00:30:42.355 --> 00:30:43.480
Let's have that discussion.

00:30:43.480 --> 00:30:45.632
Maybe your next
job's here at Google.

00:30:45.632 --> 00:30:47.215
Maybe your next job
is somewhere else.

00:30:47.215 --> 00:30:48.673
You want to start
your own company.

00:30:48.673 --> 00:30:50.300
Let's have that discussion.

00:30:50.300 --> 00:30:54.310
So maybe you want to spend
year working in marketing

00:30:54.310 --> 00:30:56.200
so you can see how that works.

00:30:56.200 --> 00:30:58.067
If that's what you
really dig and it's

00:30:58.067 --> 00:30:59.650
going be still
engaging for you, yeah,

00:30:59.650 --> 00:31:01.810
let's try to make that happen.

00:31:01.810 --> 00:31:03.322
So one is professional growth.

00:31:03.322 --> 00:31:04.530
Or what training do you need?

00:31:04.530 --> 00:31:05.988
Or do you need to
go to conference?

00:31:05.988 --> 00:31:07.850
Are you not networking
in the right way?

00:31:07.850 --> 00:31:10.380
Let's help you facilitate
that because I want to have

00:31:10.380 --> 00:31:11.980
the relationship with you.

00:31:11.980 --> 00:31:14.860
So at lunch we talked
about Zooglers.

00:31:14.860 --> 00:31:19.612
So you have a network of people
who were here and a lot of them

00:31:19.612 --> 00:31:21.820
are pretty awesome, and
they can be a resource.

00:31:21.820 --> 00:31:23.820
They're bringing work in
at their own companies.

00:31:23.820 --> 00:31:24.778
They're somewhere else.

00:31:24.778 --> 00:31:25.830
Or they come back.

00:31:25.830 --> 00:31:27.070
Someone else trained
them in some other stuff

00:31:27.070 --> 00:31:29.450
and now you can hire them back,
and they're trained for free.

00:31:29.450 --> 00:31:30.283
How awesome is that?

00:31:30.283 --> 00:31:31.420
You didn't pay for it.

00:31:31.420 --> 00:31:34.060
So maintaining those
networks, very important.

00:31:34.060 --> 00:31:37.040
So the second is
personal growth.

00:31:37.040 --> 00:31:38.337
So is your family happy?

00:31:38.337 --> 00:31:39.170
Are your kids happy?

00:31:39.170 --> 00:31:40.200
Is this where you want to be?

00:31:40.200 --> 00:31:41.800
Do you feel like
you're comfortable

00:31:41.800 --> 00:31:42.750
in your environment?

00:31:42.750 --> 00:31:44.500
Because I care about
you as a human being.

00:31:44.500 --> 00:31:46.560
I want to build this
trusting environment.

00:31:46.560 --> 00:31:47.230
Say, oh, no.

00:31:47.230 --> 00:31:50.741
My spouse, she really wants
to live in New York and blah,

00:31:50.741 --> 00:31:51.240
blah blah.

00:31:51.240 --> 00:31:51.940
Well, let's have
that discussion.

00:31:51.940 --> 00:31:53.790
As opposed to you coming into
my office pulling your hair out,

00:31:53.790 --> 00:31:56.910
going, my wife's going to leave
me unless we move back east.

00:31:56.910 --> 00:31:58.960
Let's have that
discussion in advance.

00:31:58.960 --> 00:32:00.980
Where do you see
your family going?

00:32:00.980 --> 00:32:03.150
Are you getting a good
life work life integration.

00:32:03.150 --> 00:32:04.816
Not balance, because
there's no balance.

00:32:04.816 --> 00:32:06.897
There's an integration.

00:32:06.897 --> 00:32:08.480
You want to work at
home twice a week?

00:32:08.480 --> 00:32:08.610
OK.

00:32:08.610 --> 00:32:09.940
Let's try to make that happen.

00:32:09.940 --> 00:32:12.440
For my student Beth, when
I did this review with her,

00:32:12.440 --> 00:32:14.250
what she wanted
was I want to come

00:32:14.250 --> 00:32:16.330
into work twice a week at
10 o'clock instead of 8

00:32:16.330 --> 00:32:18.180
so I can run in the morning.

00:32:18.180 --> 00:32:18.680
Boom.

00:32:18.680 --> 00:32:22.175
Let's have someone else cover
the lab from 8 to 10 Tuesday--

00:32:22.175 --> 00:32:22.800
can we do that?

00:32:22.800 --> 00:32:24.000
Sure.

00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:25.420
Because that's important to you.

00:32:25.420 --> 00:32:27.720
And I'm invested in
you as a human being.

00:32:27.720 --> 00:32:29.900
I've got to make sure
it's important for you.

00:32:29.900 --> 00:32:32.690
And the third leg of
the whole person review

00:32:32.690 --> 00:32:34.680
is what I call spiritual growth.

00:32:34.680 --> 00:32:37.850
And that can mean whatever
it means for people

00:32:37.850 --> 00:32:38.755
that you talk to.

00:32:38.755 --> 00:32:39.870
It's not professional.

00:32:39.870 --> 00:32:41.390
It's not your family.

00:32:41.390 --> 00:32:42.780
Whatever else you care about.

00:32:42.780 --> 00:32:44.050
What do you care about?

00:32:44.050 --> 00:32:46.692
So it could be I need
time to meditate.

00:32:46.692 --> 00:32:47.650
I want to take a class.

00:32:47.650 --> 00:32:49.816
I want to volunteer at my
kids' school twice a week.

00:32:50.655 --> 00:32:54.002
I'd like to get
involved in some-- I

00:32:54.002 --> 00:32:56.129
want to take up rock climbing.

00:32:56.129 --> 00:32:58.170
So I want to be able to
work half days on Fridays

00:32:58.170 --> 00:33:00.320
so I can take this
rock climbing class.

00:33:00.320 --> 00:33:02.074
Let's try to make that happen.

00:33:02.074 --> 00:33:04.490
So I want to make sure that
you have this sense of growth.

00:33:04.490 --> 00:33:06.960
When you have a sense of
growth, then what happens?

00:33:06.960 --> 00:33:08.609
You're satisfied.

00:33:08.609 --> 00:33:10.150
You feel like this
is a place for me.

00:33:10.150 --> 00:33:11.983
This is a place I can
spend my whole career.

00:33:11.983 --> 00:33:15.220
It's valuable to me.

00:33:15.220 --> 00:33:16.650
Last component is natural.

00:33:16.650 --> 00:33:19.760
So as I said earlier, sometimes,
particularly as supervisors,

00:33:19.760 --> 00:33:22.240
we think we have
to know everything.

00:33:22.240 --> 00:33:25.820
And it's really beautiful
to be imperfect.

00:33:25.820 --> 00:33:28.730
In fact, one of the
key ways to initiate

00:33:28.730 --> 00:33:31.220
the release of oxytocin
is just ask for help.

00:33:31.220 --> 00:33:33.850
And you ask for help
when you need help.

00:33:33.850 --> 00:33:36.120
So there's a finding in
psychology called the Pratfall

00:33:36.120 --> 00:33:37.290
effect.

00:33:37.290 --> 00:33:40.970
So if you stumble, people are
much more willing to help you.

00:33:40.970 --> 00:33:42.690
You're seen as
much more likable.

00:33:42.690 --> 00:33:47.440
So a classic example of this was
right after the Cuban Missile

00:33:47.440 --> 00:33:50.510
Crisis in the 1960s.

00:33:50.510 --> 00:33:52.830
All went south quickly.

00:33:52.830 --> 00:33:55.710
And so Kennedy goes
on TV and he says,

00:33:55.710 --> 00:33:57.650
I approved this
invasion of Cuba.

00:33:57.650 --> 00:33:59.480
I thought it was a good thing.

00:33:59.480 --> 00:34:01.490
Soviets are involved,
blah, blah, blah.

00:34:01.490 --> 00:34:02.740
We blew it.

00:34:02.740 --> 00:34:03.240
I blew it.

00:34:03.240 --> 00:34:04.380
I'm the President.

00:34:04.380 --> 00:34:06.710
The military advisers
gave me bad advice.

00:34:06.710 --> 00:34:08.404
And I want to be a
better president.

00:34:08.404 --> 00:34:10.469
So I'm going to try to
get better at this job.

00:34:10.469 --> 00:34:12.080
I've only been doing
this for a year.

00:34:12.080 --> 00:34:13.080
And I want your support.

00:34:13.080 --> 00:34:16.190
And I want to be the best
leader for the United States.

00:34:16.190 --> 00:34:19.030
His approval ratings went
up after the Bay of Pigs

00:34:19.030 --> 00:34:20.820
because he owned the mistake.

00:34:20.820 --> 00:34:24.190
Now, it's important that
you're seen as competent.

00:34:24.190 --> 00:34:26.659
If you're stumbling and
you're seen as incompetent,

00:34:26.659 --> 00:34:28.050
then it just hurts you.

00:34:28.050 --> 00:34:29.550
But as long as
you're competent, you

00:34:29.550 --> 00:34:34.000
can say, look, it didn't work
for-- this one didn't work out.

00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:36.239
Wasn't so good.

00:34:36.239 --> 00:34:36.739
So what?

00:34:36.739 --> 00:34:38.710
We'll move on.

00:34:38.710 --> 00:34:39.739
I'm OK with that.

00:34:39.739 --> 00:34:40.935
So live up to your mistakes.

00:34:40.935 --> 00:34:41.889
Own your mistakes.

00:34:41.889 --> 00:34:43.230
Allow yourself to be vulnerable.

00:34:43.230 --> 00:34:45.659
Southwest Airlines, which
we all fly in California,

00:34:45.659 --> 00:34:46.730
see that a lot.

00:34:46.730 --> 00:34:49.500
You see funny flight attendants.

00:34:49.500 --> 00:34:52.460
Herb Kelleher, who's the
founder and CEO for many years

00:34:52.460 --> 00:34:55.449
would toss the luggage with
the luggage handler people,

00:34:55.449 --> 00:34:56.949
would hand out
drinks on the planes,

00:34:56.949 --> 00:34:59.290
wear a funny monkey
suit to work one day.

00:34:59.290 --> 00:35:01.870
It's about really just
being himself, having fun.

00:35:01.870 --> 00:35:02.710
That's OK.

00:35:02.710 --> 00:35:03.710
And it's very appealing.

00:35:03.710 --> 00:35:06.360
And people loved him.

00:35:06.360 --> 00:35:08.440
So if we take all
of those factors,

00:35:08.440 --> 00:35:10.850
which again are not
statistically independent.

00:35:10.850 --> 00:35:12.660
Regress them on
organizational trust,

00:35:12.660 --> 00:35:15.010
we explain 100% of the
variation in trust.

00:35:15.010 --> 00:35:17.290
So there are no other classes
of measurement factors

00:35:17.290 --> 00:35:19.130
we need to worry about.

00:35:19.130 --> 00:35:22.590
So what we're trying to do
is design this environment,

00:35:22.590 --> 00:35:25.121
measure and
intervene in a series

00:35:25.121 --> 00:35:26.620
of controlled
experiments-- and I'll

00:35:26.620 --> 00:35:28.220
talk about that
in just a second--

00:35:28.220 --> 00:35:30.031
so that you are so engaged.

00:35:30.031 --> 00:35:32.030
And you're engaged not
only internally, but also

00:35:32.030 --> 00:35:33.590
externally.

00:35:33.590 --> 00:35:37.810
If I love what I do at
Google, I'm excited about it,

00:35:37.810 --> 00:35:41.280
and I see an end user, am
I like, yeah, whatever.

00:35:41.280 --> 00:35:42.235
I work at Google.

00:35:42.235 --> 00:35:43.310
They're like, yeah.

00:35:43.310 --> 00:35:45.530
It's a really cool
place to work.

00:35:45.530 --> 00:35:46.411
It's challenging.

00:35:46.411 --> 00:35:46.910
It's hard.

00:35:46.910 --> 00:35:49.150
There's super crazy
brilliant people.

00:35:49.150 --> 00:35:53.360
And we're trying to solve big
honking problems every day.

00:35:53.360 --> 00:35:55.870
That's super engaging.

00:35:55.870 --> 00:35:57.360
As opposed to, eh, whatever.

00:35:57.360 --> 00:35:58.100
They pay me.

00:35:58.100 --> 00:35:58.830
I show up.

00:35:58.830 --> 00:35:59.930
I don't want that guy.

00:35:59.930 --> 00:36:02.620
So I like what I call
the 3:00 AM employee.

00:36:02.620 --> 00:36:04.980
Not all the time,
but occasionally, I

00:36:04.980 --> 00:36:06.630
want to get an
email from someone

00:36:06.630 --> 00:36:08.210
who works for me
at 3:00 AM going,

00:36:08.210 --> 00:36:09.860
you know this problem
that we worked on

00:36:09.860 --> 00:36:12.010
for like the last month
and we couldn't solve?

00:36:12.010 --> 00:36:12.519
I found it.

00:36:12.519 --> 00:36:14.060
I woke up in the
middle of the night.

00:36:14.060 --> 00:36:15.482
I got the solution.

00:36:15.482 --> 00:36:17.690
I don't want that every day,
because then you're just

00:36:17.690 --> 00:36:19.340
a hyperactive crazy person.

00:36:19.340 --> 00:36:21.190
But what I really
want is you to be

00:36:21.190 --> 00:36:24.931
so engaged that you're doing
stuff that I can't pay you for.

00:36:24.931 --> 00:36:26.430
You're doing it
because you love it.

00:36:26.430 --> 00:36:28.919
You're doing it because
it's super engaging for you.

00:36:28.919 --> 00:36:30.960
So that's the kind of
environment I want to have.

00:36:30.960 --> 00:36:35.040
I want to create that
3:00 AM employee.

00:36:35.040 --> 00:36:39.610
So interesting outcome
from the neuroscience

00:36:39.610 --> 00:36:43.770
is that the pathway for trust
in the brain, this larger brain

00:36:43.770 --> 00:36:47.590
circuit that we've
characterized as using oxytocin,

00:36:47.590 --> 00:36:51.460
is overlapped strongly
with a brain circuit that

00:36:51.460 --> 00:36:55.770
activates when we are helping
or caring for other people.

00:36:55.770 --> 00:36:59.650
So besides Strucker, my
other management hero

00:36:59.650 --> 00:37:01.620
is Edwards Deming.

00:37:01.620 --> 00:37:04.920
And so Deming said at its core,
every organization's mission

00:37:04.920 --> 00:37:06.784
is to improve lives.

00:37:06.784 --> 00:37:08.700
So that's what I call
the transcendent purpose

00:37:08.700 --> 00:37:10.130
of our organization.

00:37:10.130 --> 00:37:14.180
So if employees understand
that transcendent purpose,

00:37:14.180 --> 00:37:16.470
the neuroscience
suggests that there would

00:37:16.470 --> 00:37:17.910
be this synergistic effect.

00:37:17.910 --> 00:37:21.160
High trust plus high purpose
would produce this great sense

00:37:21.160 --> 00:37:22.390
of joy, this happiness.

00:37:22.390 --> 00:37:23.654
I just love it here.

00:37:23.654 --> 00:37:25.445
So in fact, we find
that in the data, which

00:37:25.445 --> 00:37:26.940
I'll show you in a second.

00:37:26.940 --> 00:37:28.876
That picture is from Zappos.com.

00:37:28.876 --> 00:37:30.250
That's called
"Monkey Row," which

00:37:30.250 --> 00:37:32.999
is where Tony Hsieh
and his CEOs--

00:37:32.999 --> 00:37:35.290
actually, that's their old
office outside-- now they're

00:37:35.290 --> 00:37:36.790
in downtown Las Vegas.

00:37:36.790 --> 00:37:38.030
That's the old office.

00:37:38.030 --> 00:37:38.940
But it looks crazy.

00:37:38.940 --> 00:37:39.440
It's weird.

00:37:39.440 --> 00:37:41.050
People decorate
it in a funny way

00:37:41.050 --> 00:37:42.800
and they're having a great time.

00:37:42.800 --> 00:37:45.062
It's fun.

00:37:45.062 --> 00:37:45.895
What are they doing?

00:37:45.895 --> 00:37:47.539
They're selling
shoes and clothes.

00:37:47.539 --> 00:37:49.080
But if you do it in
a way that really

00:37:49.080 --> 00:37:52.970
makes people super happy, it's
fun, it's engaging, it's funky.

00:37:52.970 --> 00:37:55.046
You can throw a Nerf
ball around and have fun.

00:37:55.046 --> 00:37:56.420
Yeah, it's still
a super fun job.

00:37:56.420 --> 00:37:56.920
It can be.

00:38:00.580 --> 00:38:04.610
So you can reverse
engineer this process.

00:38:04.610 --> 00:38:10.370
So for the people ops,
people dev people.

00:38:10.370 --> 00:38:12.200
If you don't have
joy at work, then you

00:38:12.200 --> 00:38:14.080
might investigate
some of these factors.

00:38:14.080 --> 00:38:15.950
So again, from the
neuroscience we've

00:38:15.950 --> 00:38:18.295
done-- which I'm glossing
over, but I'm happy to share--

00:38:18.295 --> 00:38:21.690
and I have shared with
Barbara, some of the papers--

00:38:21.690 --> 00:38:24.440
does suggest that places
you want to push on

00:38:24.440 --> 00:38:27.860
are we're not communicating this
transcendent purpose very well.

00:38:27.860 --> 00:38:30.170
Or our trust levels are low.

00:38:30.170 --> 00:38:31.580
Or both.

00:38:31.580 --> 00:38:36.020
So think of joy as, in
statistics language,

00:38:36.020 --> 00:38:40.810
as a sufficient statistic for
a well functioning workplace.

00:38:40.810 --> 00:38:42.300
If people are super
happy at work,

00:38:42.300 --> 00:38:45.280
they're probably doing
things pretty well.

00:38:45.280 --> 00:38:47.780
So here are outcome measures,
and we'll take some questions.

00:38:47.780 --> 00:38:51.480
So if I look at the top quartile
of people using this O Factor

00:38:51.480 --> 00:38:54.610
tool we developed to
measure organizational trust

00:38:54.610 --> 00:38:57.520
and compare that to
the bottom quartile,

00:38:57.520 --> 00:39:02.695
we find less chronic
stress, more energy,

00:39:02.695 --> 00:39:03.570
greater productivity.

00:39:03.570 --> 00:39:05.540
These are directly
measured, not self reported.

00:39:05.540 --> 00:39:06.290
Directly measured.

00:39:06.290 --> 00:39:07.940
We gave employees
tasks to do and just

00:39:07.940 --> 00:39:11.130
measured with or
without, essentially,

00:39:11.130 --> 00:39:14.590
a culture prime, how
productive they were.

00:39:14.590 --> 00:39:16.320
More joy at work.

00:39:16.320 --> 00:39:17.590
Greater sense of purpose.

00:39:17.590 --> 00:39:21.080
That is, values alignment
with the organization.

00:39:21.080 --> 00:39:24.330
I really love my
organization's mission.

00:39:24.330 --> 00:39:25.915
Employee tension
much, much higher

00:39:25.915 --> 00:39:28.850
in high stress organizations.

00:39:28.850 --> 00:39:30.520
Greater job satisfaction.

00:39:30.520 --> 00:39:33.540
Innovation we
measured with a task

00:39:33.540 --> 00:39:35.580
we use in experiments,
field experiments,

00:39:35.580 --> 00:39:38.490
where people have to solve
a difficult problem together

00:39:38.490 --> 00:39:41.000
in a group that they've
never seen before.

00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:44.240
And we can measure how
many steps they got through

00:39:44.240 --> 00:39:45.740
in solving this hard problem.

00:39:45.740 --> 00:39:47.840
So high trust employees
work better together.

00:39:47.840 --> 00:39:50.460
They have these more
efficient social bonds.

00:39:50.460 --> 00:39:52.140
They solve problems better.

00:39:52.140 --> 00:39:52.950
Fewer sick days.

00:39:52.950 --> 00:39:55.566
And here's the last thing that
was really exciting for me.

00:39:55.566 --> 00:39:56.940
Not only are people
in high trust

00:39:56.940 --> 00:40:00.460
replaces more productive,
more innovative, healthier.

00:40:00.460 --> 00:40:04.350
They are more satisfied with
their lives outside of work.

00:40:04.350 --> 00:40:07.140
So when you create
a great culture,

00:40:07.140 --> 00:40:11.140
you're also creating great
parents, great citizens,

00:40:11.140 --> 00:40:13.260
and a great society.

00:40:13.260 --> 00:40:15.249
That's really, to me,
the triple bottom line.

00:40:15.249 --> 00:40:17.290
Good for the employee,
good for the organization,

00:40:17.290 --> 00:40:18.081
good for the world.

00:40:20.600 --> 00:40:23.819
So we find this in-- that's
an old slide, by the way.

00:40:23.819 --> 00:40:25.735
I didn't know I had the
Google slide in there.

00:40:25.735 --> 00:40:28.020
Isn't that appropriate.

00:40:28.020 --> 00:40:30.800
So we find this in, for example,
the best companies to work for.

00:40:30.800 --> 00:40:33.790
The survey that Fortune's
done for about 25 years.

00:40:33.790 --> 00:40:36.505
And recent analysis at the
Wharton School, University

00:40:36.505 --> 00:40:38.940
of Pennsylvania showed
that these best companies

00:40:38.940 --> 00:40:42.110
to work for in fact have
much higher stock returns.

00:40:42.110 --> 00:40:47.925
So that great culture is in some
sense a competitive advantage.

00:40:47.925 --> 00:40:50.600
It allows them to
generate higher profits

00:40:50.600 --> 00:40:52.791
over a longer term.

00:40:52.791 --> 00:40:54.790
So first of all, you're
increasing productivity.

00:40:54.790 --> 00:40:58.210
But you're also reducing
things like hiring costs.

00:40:58.210 --> 00:41:02.030
So it costs about 20% of
annual salary to hire somebody.

00:41:02.030 --> 00:41:04.450
So increase retention--
assuming you're

00:41:04.450 --> 00:41:06.590
hiring the right people--
then these people are not

00:41:06.590 --> 00:41:08.965
only more productive, but you
don't have to hire as many.

00:41:08.965 --> 00:41:10.560
Turn is lower.

00:41:10.560 --> 00:41:14.280
So looks like there's actually
a real big payoff here.

00:41:14.280 --> 00:41:16.540
So here's the recipe.

00:41:16.540 --> 00:41:18.020
How do I use this?

00:41:18.020 --> 00:41:21.470
Here's the take home
punchline slide.

00:41:21.470 --> 00:41:23.344
Run controlled
management experiments.

00:41:23.344 --> 00:41:26.010
Just like you run experiments on
the software, on the interface,

00:41:26.010 --> 00:41:28.620
on the UX, just start out.

00:41:28.620 --> 00:41:30.940
Clarify what objective
you want to push on.

00:41:30.940 --> 00:41:34.120
I'm going to give you a concrete
example in just a moment.

00:41:34.120 --> 00:41:36.290
Identify how you
measure the change.

00:41:36.290 --> 00:41:40.370
How would I know if I'm
moving towards that objective?

00:41:40.370 --> 00:41:42.822
Then identify an experiment
and tell people in the group,

00:41:42.822 --> 00:41:44.280
we're going to try
this experiment.

00:41:44.280 --> 00:41:48.314
We're going to intervene here,
and we'll see what happens.

00:41:48.314 --> 00:41:49.355
Implement the innovation.

00:41:51.930 --> 00:41:55.072
If it works, stick with it.

00:41:55.072 --> 00:41:56.780
If it doesn't, go back
to the status quo.

00:41:56.780 --> 00:41:57.571
Hey, we tried this.

00:41:57.571 --> 00:42:00.000
It didn't work.

00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:01.440
We thought it would be good.

00:42:01.440 --> 00:42:02.472
You guys didn't like it.

00:42:02.472 --> 00:42:04.180
We'll just go back to
what we did before.

00:42:04.180 --> 00:42:06.660
No harm, no foul.

00:42:06.660 --> 00:42:08.700
And then do it again.

00:42:08.700 --> 00:42:10.760
So this very much
an [INAUDIBLE] role.

00:42:10.760 --> 00:42:12.359
Kind of get continuous
improvement.

00:42:12.359 --> 00:42:14.150
Little management
experiments all the time.

00:42:14.150 --> 00:42:16.447
And I know you guys do
this all the time anyway.

00:42:16.447 --> 00:42:18.530
But I'm trying to give you
a theoretical structure

00:42:18.530 --> 00:42:19.770
underneath that.

00:42:19.770 --> 00:42:22.520
It's really about
building a culture

00:42:22.520 --> 00:42:25.770
in which social
relationships are paramount.

00:42:25.770 --> 00:42:27.240
They're really,
really efficient.

00:42:27.240 --> 00:42:31.970
So I think of trust
as a social lubricant.

00:42:31.970 --> 00:42:33.470
When trust is high,
it's easy to get

00:42:33.470 --> 00:42:35.610
things done because the
frictions are lower.

00:42:35.610 --> 00:42:37.559
And it includes getting
things done at work.

00:42:37.559 --> 00:42:39.100
It's just easier
when I trust people.

00:42:39.100 --> 00:42:43.060
So I want to thoughtfully
design a culture for high trust

00:42:43.060 --> 00:42:45.970
because I want to reduce
those frictions at work.

00:42:45.970 --> 00:42:47.460
So here's an example.

00:42:47.460 --> 00:42:51.770
We worked with a large-ish
insurance company,

00:42:51.770 --> 00:42:53.480
whose name you would know.

00:42:53.480 --> 00:42:55.610
And they had retention problems.

00:42:55.610 --> 00:42:59.430
And their retention problems
were in a particular division.

00:42:59.430 --> 00:43:00.350
And so we said, OK.

00:43:00.350 --> 00:43:01.730
Let's work on that division.

00:43:01.730 --> 00:43:04.420
So your problem
is high turnover.

00:43:04.420 --> 00:43:06.140
And so when we did
the O Factor survey,

00:43:06.140 --> 00:43:09.040
we found that the invest
number, of those eight factors,

00:43:09.040 --> 00:43:10.272
invest was really low.

00:43:10.272 --> 00:43:12.230
And you talked to the
employees and they'd say,

00:43:12.230 --> 00:43:14.240
you know what, I got
hired here out of college.

00:43:14.240 --> 00:43:15.780
I'm working in this division.

00:43:15.780 --> 00:43:16.960
There's no career ladder.

00:43:16.960 --> 00:43:20.040
No one's really mentoring me.

00:43:20.040 --> 00:43:22.560
It's a burnout job, entry level.

00:43:22.560 --> 00:43:24.330
I just leave.

00:43:24.330 --> 00:43:24.890
I said, OK.

00:43:24.890 --> 00:43:28.160
Let's put in programs so
that you have mentors.

00:43:28.160 --> 00:43:29.950
You have a clear career ladder.

00:43:29.950 --> 00:43:31.840
You have a career coach.

00:43:31.840 --> 00:43:33.550
Let's hire some
people who are senior,

00:43:33.550 --> 00:43:34.880
and their job is to coach you.

00:43:34.880 --> 00:43:35.420
Where are you going?

00:43:35.420 --> 00:43:36.128
What do you like?

00:43:36.128 --> 00:43:37.940
Which division would
you like to move to?

00:43:37.940 --> 00:43:41.020
How do I help you get your
next job within this company?

00:43:41.020 --> 00:43:43.350
So really, really effective.

00:43:43.350 --> 00:43:45.260
Communicate clearly the change.

00:43:45.260 --> 00:43:46.770
Implement the change.

00:43:46.770 --> 00:43:50.194
And in this company,
retention went way up.

00:43:50.194 --> 00:43:51.110
People said, oh, yeah.

00:43:51.110 --> 00:43:51.920
Now I get.

00:43:51.920 --> 00:43:54.440
I'm starting here on the
phones, not super fun.

00:43:54.440 --> 00:43:58.150
But if I do well here,
I'm learning this business

00:43:58.150 --> 00:44:00.380
from the ground up
and I'll move on.

00:44:00.380 --> 00:44:05.219
So super clear on
what we're doing.

00:44:05.219 --> 00:44:06.510
Time for questions or comments?

00:44:06.510 --> 00:44:09.600
I know I spoke super fast
and didn't take any breaths.

00:44:09.600 --> 00:44:11.202
And that's just the way I am.

00:44:11.202 --> 00:44:12.660
But I'd be happy
to take questions.

00:44:12.660 --> 00:44:15.447
Do we need to use the mic, sir?

00:44:15.447 --> 00:44:16.530
We do need to use the mic.

00:44:16.530 --> 00:44:19.400
So thank you for
listening and I'm

00:44:19.400 --> 00:44:23.075
hoping to be of service to
all my friends at Google.

00:44:23.075 --> 00:44:25.450
It's my fourth trip, so super
happy to be here, you guys.

00:44:25.450 --> 00:44:28.170
Thank you so much, and thank to
Barbara Usher who brought me in

00:44:28.170 --> 00:44:29.756
and Simon who arranged my visit.

00:44:29.756 --> 00:44:30.922
SZYMON PERKOWSKI: All right.

00:44:30.922 --> 00:44:32.460
Let's give Paul a
round of applause.

00:44:32.460 --> 00:44:33.460
PAUL ZAK: Oh, thank you.

00:44:33.460 --> 00:44:35.215
[APPLAUSE]

00:44:35.964 --> 00:44:37.380
SZYMON PERKOWSKI:
So at this time,

00:44:37.380 --> 00:44:39.445
we'll take some questions
from the audience.

00:44:39.445 --> 00:44:41.240
AUDIENCE: I have a
question about oxytocin.

00:44:41.240 --> 00:44:42.114
PAUL ZAK: Yes, ma'am.

00:44:42.114 --> 00:44:45.580
AUDIENCE: I'm wondering how
much the baseline levels differ

00:44:45.580 --> 00:44:48.210
between individuals generally,
and if they are drastically

00:44:48.210 --> 00:44:51.160
lower in people who
are, like, psychopaths

00:44:51.160 --> 00:44:54.789
or maybe suffer from
forms of autism or--

00:44:54.789 --> 00:44:55.830
PAUL ZAK: Great question.

00:44:55.830 --> 00:44:58.875
And so the back story on
this, what started out

00:44:58.875 --> 00:45:01.550
as basic science research did
spawn a lot of clinical trials

00:45:01.550 --> 00:45:04.650
for things like autism,
schizophrenia, social anxiety,

00:45:04.650 --> 00:45:06.110
depression.

00:45:06.110 --> 00:45:09.820
We've work with
psychopaths in prisons.

00:45:09.820 --> 00:45:14.520
So oxytocin, like many
other chemicals in the body,

00:45:14.520 --> 00:45:16.010
is re-used.

00:45:16.010 --> 00:45:18.760
So it functions
outside the brain

00:45:18.760 --> 00:45:21.970
to facilitate uterine
contractions during birth,

00:45:21.970 --> 00:45:23.864
milk letdown for breastfeeding.

00:45:23.864 --> 00:45:25.530
But in the brain, it
functions much more

00:45:25.530 --> 00:45:28.720
like a neurotransmitter,
that is, acute responses.

00:45:28.720 --> 00:45:34.550
And so the secret on why it
really hadn't been studied

00:45:34.550 --> 00:45:36.740
outside of reproduction is
no one figured out a way

00:45:36.740 --> 00:45:39.350
to actually measure that acute
brain response, and we did.

00:45:39.350 --> 00:45:41.020
And once we had this tool,
then you can go to town

00:45:41.020 --> 00:45:42.770
and ask a lot of
questions with that tool.

00:45:42.770 --> 00:45:44.569
And this was based
on animal research.

00:45:44.569 --> 00:45:47.110
So I took the animal research,
turned it into human research,

00:45:47.110 --> 00:45:48.450
which is not always trivial.

00:45:48.450 --> 00:45:50.530
But once we had that, it worked.

00:45:50.530 --> 00:45:54.130
So what we found is that
everybody makes oxytocin,

00:45:54.130 --> 00:45:56.840
they just don't always
make it at the right times.

00:45:56.840 --> 00:46:00.800
So if you're having a really
bad day, high levels of stress,

00:46:00.800 --> 00:46:02.540
you inhibit oxytocin release.

00:46:02.540 --> 00:46:04.510
If you had a very
adverse childhood,

00:46:04.510 --> 00:46:07.530
abuse neglect history,
then the brain regions that

00:46:07.530 --> 00:46:10.900
should have many oxytocin
receptors atrophy,

00:46:10.900 --> 00:46:14.130
and then you don't get
this feel good effect

00:46:14.130 --> 00:46:18.470
that we get when we interact
with people in a nice way.

00:46:18.470 --> 00:46:22.280
In the psychopathic study,
this is research coming out

00:46:22.280 --> 00:46:25.481
soon in a journal, we found that
all those guys make oxytocin.

00:46:25.481 --> 00:46:26.730
So it's not the chronic level.

00:46:26.730 --> 00:46:28.340
It's this acute response.

00:46:28.340 --> 00:46:29.844
And that's the trick.

00:46:29.844 --> 00:46:32.010
They don't get the acute
response in the right away.

00:46:32.010 --> 00:46:34.260
And, in fact, they
make lots of oxytocin

00:46:34.260 --> 00:46:36.380
because their receptors
are dysfunctional.

00:46:36.380 --> 00:46:38.470
And what do they lack primarily?

00:46:38.470 --> 00:46:40.090
Psychopaths lack empathy.

00:46:40.090 --> 00:46:42.730
And that's exactly what
oxytocin increases most.

00:46:42.730 --> 00:46:48.700
So oxytocin is an
innate moral compass.

00:46:48.700 --> 00:46:51.450
I'm getting feedback when I
interact with the humans based

00:46:51.450 --> 00:46:54.900
on their body language,
the way they treat me,

00:46:54.900 --> 00:46:58.204
their expressions, on whether
my behavior was appropriate.

00:46:58.204 --> 00:46:59.620
And once you've
been on the planet

00:46:59.620 --> 00:47:01.120
for more than about
20 years, you've

00:47:01.120 --> 00:47:04.760
figured out that I could get
Eric to help me with my project

00:47:04.760 --> 00:47:06.990
by beating the crap
out of him, or I

00:47:06.990 --> 00:47:08.220
could treat him really nice.

00:47:08.220 --> 00:47:09.532
Eric, you're super smart, man.

00:47:09.532 --> 00:47:10.240
Do you have time?

00:47:10.240 --> 00:47:12.573
Do you have like half an hour
you can help me with this?

00:47:12.573 --> 00:47:14.290
That's a much better
approach, right?

00:47:14.290 --> 00:47:19.100
So anyway, it doesn't take
a genius to figure that out.

00:47:19.100 --> 00:47:23.290
But the hard part
is taking this quote

00:47:23.290 --> 00:47:28.140
"reproductive" hormone as
one of my colleagues said,

00:47:28.140 --> 00:47:31.050
this female hormone, and
showing that we all release it.

00:47:31.050 --> 00:47:32.590
And in the right
circumstances, it

00:47:32.590 --> 00:47:35.320
guides us to the
appropriate social behavior.

00:47:35.320 --> 00:47:36.980
So yeah, great science question.

00:47:36.980 --> 00:47:37.646
Thank you.

00:47:37.646 --> 00:47:38.520
SZYMON PERKOWSKI: OK.

00:47:38.520 --> 00:47:40.077
There's another
question on the Dory.

00:47:40.077 --> 00:47:40.660
PAUL ZAK: Yes.

00:47:40.660 --> 00:47:42.140
SZYMON PERKOWSKI: "Do some
people need these factors

00:47:42.140 --> 00:47:42.960
more than others?

00:47:42.960 --> 00:47:45.350
It seems that some people
function better in workplaces

00:47:45.350 --> 00:47:47.780
without many of these
features than other people do.

00:47:47.780 --> 00:47:50.915
If so, do you have any thoughts
about the differences?"

00:47:50.915 --> 00:47:51.540
PAUL ZAK: Yeah.

00:47:51.540 --> 00:47:52.456
It's a great question.

00:47:52.456 --> 00:47:57.700
This reminds me of your
former colleague Marissa Mayer

00:47:57.700 --> 00:48:01.170
at Yahoo, having
everybody come into work.

00:48:01.170 --> 00:48:05.350
So what if a loner and I
just like to be by myself,

00:48:05.350 --> 00:48:08.120
and I don't need
the human so much.

00:48:08.120 --> 00:48:10.250
I think to an extent,
Marissa was right.

00:48:10.250 --> 00:48:12.700
We do want to have these
collisions in which I'm just

00:48:12.700 --> 00:48:14.459
bumping into people.

00:48:14.459 --> 00:48:16.000
From my time here
today, I understand

00:48:16.000 --> 00:48:19.540
that you guys create
teams are very rapidly

00:48:19.540 --> 00:48:21.600
and reform teams very rapidly.

00:48:21.600 --> 00:48:23.152
So it's difficult
to trust someone

00:48:23.152 --> 00:48:24.360
that I don't know much about.

00:48:24.360 --> 00:48:25.960
Even though they work here.

00:48:25.960 --> 00:48:28.160
They have to be kind of
OK because they work here.

00:48:28.160 --> 00:48:28.951
How do I know that?

00:48:28.951 --> 00:48:30.280
How do I build trust rapidly?

00:48:30.280 --> 00:48:31.950
So that's what I
want to talk about.

00:48:31.950 --> 00:48:37.040
And one way is to use these
factors in the micro scale.

00:48:37.040 --> 00:48:41.630
So I can actually tell the
people in my group something

00:48:41.630 --> 00:48:42.630
vulnerable about myself.

00:48:42.630 --> 00:48:43.588
Something embarrassing.

00:48:43.588 --> 00:48:44.650
Something difficult.

00:48:44.650 --> 00:48:46.180
So I have students
do this in class.

00:48:46.180 --> 00:48:47.930
So tell me something
really weird about yourself

00:48:47.930 --> 00:48:48.804
so I can remember it.

00:48:48.804 --> 00:48:50.400
First, I'll remember you better.

00:48:50.400 --> 00:48:53.960
But something that's
not super flattering.

00:48:53.960 --> 00:48:55.126
Something unusual.

00:48:55.126 --> 00:48:56.250
So you can start with that.

00:48:56.250 --> 00:48:57.820
Just start small.

00:48:57.820 --> 00:49:00.080
Before we talk about
work, let's just about us.

00:49:00.080 --> 00:49:02.288
We're going to have to work
together for the next two

00:49:02.288 --> 00:49:03.790
months on this project.

00:49:03.790 --> 00:49:05.720
How are we going to do that?

00:49:05.720 --> 00:49:08.610
I know two people here and
the other seven I don't know.

00:49:08.610 --> 00:49:09.580
How do we do that?

00:49:09.580 --> 00:49:12.365
First of all, you
keep teams small.

00:49:12.365 --> 00:49:16.150
I was talking with folks
in people dev this morning,

00:49:16.150 --> 00:49:20.140
and average team size they
said is nine people here.

00:49:20.140 --> 00:49:20.950
So that's good.

00:49:20.950 --> 00:49:23.832
So single digit teams, much
better than super large teams.

00:49:23.832 --> 00:49:25.790
We can actually have that
personal interaction.

00:49:25.790 --> 00:49:26.820
I know your name.

00:49:26.820 --> 00:49:28.230
I know something about you.

00:49:28.230 --> 00:49:29.771
And then you've got
to actually share

00:49:29.771 --> 00:49:36.410
a little bit outside just I'm
a Ruby on Rails programmer

00:49:36.410 --> 00:49:38.540
and that's my goal in life.

00:49:38.540 --> 00:49:41.119
Or I work in Go or whatever.

00:49:41.119 --> 00:49:43.160
I need to actually know
something more about you.

00:49:43.160 --> 00:49:44.530
So do you have a dog?

00:49:44.530 --> 00:49:45.410
Do you have kids?

00:49:45.410 --> 00:49:45.960
Do you have a wife?

00:49:45.960 --> 00:49:47.290
We did this at meetings, right?

00:49:47.290 --> 00:49:48.600
Do you know someone I know?

00:49:48.600 --> 00:49:48.900
Oh, yeah.

00:49:48.900 --> 00:49:49.441
I know Simon.

00:49:50.310 --> 00:49:52.490
So do a little bit of sharing.

00:49:52.490 --> 00:49:53.830
It's actually not wasted time.

00:49:53.830 --> 00:49:56.750
Just like the 10 minute
pre-meeting meditation's

00:49:56.750 --> 00:49:58.210
not a waste of time.

00:49:58.210 --> 00:49:58.990
Get focused.

00:49:58.990 --> 00:50:01.820
In that case, it's
focusing on being present.

00:50:01.820 --> 00:50:04.750
I think the trust work is
really focusing on others.

00:50:04.750 --> 00:50:06.550
It's not focusing so much on me.

00:50:06.550 --> 00:50:08.060
Let's just focus on who you are.

00:50:08.060 --> 00:50:09.560
What do you want
to get out of this?

00:50:09.560 --> 00:50:10.750
What are your real goals?

00:50:10.750 --> 00:50:12.850
What drives you crazy here?

00:50:12.850 --> 00:50:15.090
What makes you super happy?

00:50:15.090 --> 00:50:17.320
We could do that in 10 minutes.

00:50:17.320 --> 00:50:19.680
Tell me one thing that's
really unusual that you

00:50:19.680 --> 00:50:21.920
love about Google,
and tell me one thing

00:50:21.920 --> 00:50:24.070
that drives you nuts here.

00:50:24.070 --> 00:50:25.090
You guys all know that.

00:50:25.090 --> 00:50:28.700
You don't have to share it
now, but you all know it.

00:50:28.700 --> 00:50:31.600
So let me know about
you, because you're

00:50:31.600 --> 00:50:33.210
a human, not a human resource.

00:50:33.210 --> 00:50:37.674
So I think just changing
that language is a start.

00:50:37.674 --> 00:50:39.090
Are there personality
differences?

00:50:39.090 --> 00:50:39.670
For sure.

00:50:39.670 --> 00:50:42.340
And we see in experiments
there are about 5%

00:50:42.340 --> 00:50:44.200
of the population who
are super responders.

00:50:44.200 --> 00:50:50.060
They increase oxytocin
levels with a social stimulus

00:50:50.060 --> 00:50:52.290
five standard variations
above the mean.

00:50:52.290 --> 00:50:54.731
And they're super
empathic, super warm.

00:50:54.731 --> 00:50:55.980
Those people are always great.

00:50:55.980 --> 00:50:57.080
They have tons of friends.

00:50:57.080 --> 00:50:58.290
Everything works for them.

00:50:58.290 --> 00:51:00.373
What I think you want to
do is bring in the people

00:51:00.373 --> 00:51:02.140
who struggle a little bit.

00:51:02.140 --> 00:51:04.090
Who maybe are more introverted.

00:51:04.090 --> 00:51:06.642
Who don't like to leave
their offices much.

00:51:06.642 --> 00:51:09.100
Say, let's go down
to the cafeteria.

00:51:09.100 --> 00:51:11.930
Let's grab a coffee or
grab a beer after work.

00:51:11.930 --> 00:51:15.510
Spend a little bit of investment
and get to know that person.

00:51:15.510 --> 00:51:17.630
I think it's not that hard.

00:51:17.630 --> 00:51:20.720
And you know my prescription
as Dr. Love is, of course,

00:51:20.720 --> 00:51:21.950
eight hugs a day.

00:51:21.950 --> 00:51:23.600
So it's OK.

00:51:23.600 --> 00:51:25.070
You can hug people at work.

00:51:25.070 --> 00:51:26.400
You won't get sued.

00:51:26.400 --> 00:51:28.467
No creepy hugs.

00:51:28.467 --> 00:51:30.300
Just say, look, I hug
everybody in my group.

00:51:30.300 --> 00:51:32.062
I saw a lot of
people hugging today.

00:51:32.062 --> 00:51:32.770
It's appropriate.

00:51:32.770 --> 00:51:34.480
That's what the humans do.

00:51:34.480 --> 00:51:36.190
You can build that relationship.

00:51:36.190 --> 00:51:38.740
Or I'll go play some volleyball,
go play some ping pong.

00:51:38.740 --> 00:51:40.850
Get to know that person
just a little bit.

00:51:40.850 --> 00:51:42.610
You'd be surprised.

00:51:42.610 --> 00:51:46.690
And also I have to say, also
celebrate the difficult people.

00:51:46.690 --> 00:51:48.360
So there are
difficult people here.

00:51:48.360 --> 00:51:50.740
There are difficult
people everywhere.

00:51:50.740 --> 00:51:55.630
See them as an opportunity for
you to practice compassion,

00:51:55.630 --> 00:51:58.150
for you to really show
you trust someone who's

00:51:58.150 --> 00:52:01.425
hard to trust, who
just isn't as open.

00:52:01.425 --> 00:52:03.050
That's a great way
to stretch yourself,

00:52:03.050 --> 00:52:04.980
since we're all
interested in investment,

00:52:04.980 --> 00:52:06.420
in growing a little bit.

00:52:06.420 --> 00:52:07.830
Gives you a chance to grow.

00:52:07.830 --> 00:52:08.650
SZYMON PERKOWSKI:
We're out of time.

00:52:08.650 --> 00:52:09.500
PAUL ZAK: We're out of time.

00:52:09.500 --> 00:52:10.000
Gosh.

00:52:10.000 --> 00:52:12.620
SZYMON PERKOWSKI: But I wanted
to thank Paul once again

00:52:12.620 --> 00:52:14.387
for coming here and speaking.

00:52:14.387 --> 00:52:15.970
PAUL ZAK: And thank
you for listening.

00:52:15.970 --> 00:52:19.320
