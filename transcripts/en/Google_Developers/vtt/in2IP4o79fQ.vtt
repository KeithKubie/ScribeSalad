00:00:07.684 --> 00:00:10.100
DYLAN THOMAS: Hello and welcome
to another episode of What

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:10.641
In the World.

00:00:10.641 --> 00:00:13.554
This is a regular show where
enterprise Geo Googlers look

00:00:13.554 --> 00:00:15.720
at something interesting
in the enterprise products.

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:16.990
My name's Dylan Thomas.

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:18.850
I'm a maps community manager.

00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:21.195
And joining me
today is Alan Poole.

00:00:21.195 --> 00:00:22.730
ALAN POOLE: Hello.

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:24.200
DYLAN THOMAS: Alan
helps customers

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:26.660
get products deployed
in production.

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:29.690
And so what we wanted to
talk with Alan about today

00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:33.350
was sort of a second installment
of Google Maps Engine

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.860
connectors.

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:38.500
So on our last episode, we talk
to Ujaval Gandhi about the QGIS

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:42.460
connector he had written
to allow the QGIS desktop

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:46.470
product to connect with Google
Maps Engine for use there.

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:49.740
And what Alan has done is
actually take that same concept

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:53.500
and applied it to ArcGIS, the
commercial desktop GIS product.

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:56.450
So, can you just tell
us briefly before we

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:58.920
look at the demo what the
impetus was behind that?

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:00.680
ALAN POOLE: Sure.

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:04.340
We developed these connectors
for QGIS and ArcGIS

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:11.040
desktop to make it very simple
to sign in if you are a Google

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:15.120
user, as well as find a
map and view it inside

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:17.280
of these desktop tools.

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:20.140
So we want it to be dead
simple for an end user

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:23.970
to view their published
Google Maps Engine maps.

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:27.030
And the primary reason for
building these connectors

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:32.390
is to allow the desktop tools
to securely talk with the Google

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:36.200
Cloud and allow you to sign
in with your credentials.

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:39.850
So the Google Maps Engine
connector for ArcGIS desktop

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:42.620
is available for free.

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:48.030
And it is available to anyone
on the arcgis.com gallery.

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:51.850
So if you go to arcgis.com
and you search for Google Maps

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:57.430
Engine connector and
you click on Tools

00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:00.630
and you show our
chairs desktop content,

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:03.220
our tools will show up as well.

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:05.900
So the Google Maps Engine
connector for ArcGIS desktop

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:08.900
will show in the search results.

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:11.590
And it's as simple as
clicking the open link

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:15.985
to download it and install
it in your Arc map instance.

00:02:15.985 --> 00:02:17.860
DYLAN THOMAS: So for
any ArcGIS desktop user,

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:19.192
this is just a no-brainer.

00:02:19.192 --> 00:02:20.150
This is how they do it.

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:23.580
There's no special
thing going on.

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:26.260
ALAN POOLE: No special thing
going on with these tools.

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:29.420
It's built using the
ESRI add-in framework.

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:31.180
So these are just
like any other add-in

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:32.960
that you would add to ArcMap.

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:38.376
So I'm going to launch
ArcMap to open ArcMap 10.2.

00:02:38.376 --> 00:02:41.150
And we'll give it a
few seconds to load.

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:54.350
So this is a standard ArcMap.

00:02:54.350 --> 00:03:00.450
And what you see is the
Google Maps Engine connector

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:04.740
for ArcMap tool bar
that is available.

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:06.650
If you don't see
the toolbar, you

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:10.510
can right click
on the tool area,

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:16.260
and it's available to turn
on if you don't see it.

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:22.290
And you'll note that the
tool bar that's available.

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:25.060
None of the buttons
are enabled by default.

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:28.090
So the first step with
the connector for ArcMap

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:31.510
is you need to sign in
with your Google account.

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:34.560
And any Google
account will work.

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:38.520
So the first button lets
you sign in or sign out

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:40.080
of your Google account.

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:42.180
So I'm going to click
the Sign In button.

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:48.810
And since I've already signed in
with my demonstration account,

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:51.050
my name is remembered.

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:55.270
But you could sign in with some
Gmail account or some Google

00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:56.590
apps account as well.

00:03:56.590 --> 00:03:59.590
I'm going to sign in and
authenticate with my Alan Poole

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:01.820
at altostrat.com account.

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:05.430
The second step is you need
to authorize the connector

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:08.502
to access your Google
Maps Engine data.

00:04:08.502 --> 00:04:09.710
So I'm going to click accept.

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:18.519
And you'll note that the
Find button becomes active.

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:23.170
So once you're signed in, you're
able to find Google Maps Engine

00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:26.192
maps in any maps engine account.

00:04:26.192 --> 00:04:27.900
So I'm going to click
on the Find button.

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:32.950
And the dialogue
pops up and lets

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:35.650
you find any published
map that is available.

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:37.175
And these are the
same maps that we

00:04:37.175 --> 00:04:40.620
showed last week
with Ujaval in QGIS.

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:43.960
They're also available to
view here inside of ArcGIS.

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:48.730
So I'm going to click on
the "Earth at Night" map

00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:51.520
that he showed last week.

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:55.710
And the ArcGIS
connector communicates

00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:58.220
with Google Maps Engine
and automatically ads

00:04:58.220 --> 00:05:03.050
a WMS layer of all the layers
inside of your published map.

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:08.130
So if you have a Google Maps
Engine map with vector data

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:12.810
or raster data, those layers are
available in one single click.

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:17.110
So I'm going to turn
on these WMS layers.

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:22.350
And you can see this is the
world at night as published

00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:24.650
by NASA.

00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:27.120
And there is a
secondary layer that's

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:29.820
added with kind of
ancillary metadata

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:32.510
about your Google
Maps Engine map.

00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:34.530
So let me add a
Google Maps engine

00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:36.840
map that contains
vector data as well.

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:40.260
So to do that, I'm going to
change the projection of my map

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:46.410
to Web Mercator to align
with the Google Maps Engine

00:05:46.410 --> 00:05:47.110
projections.

00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:49.920
Now if I go back to
the search dialogue,

00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:52.480
I published some
census data as well.

00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:56.260
So there are some census
data for San Francisco.

00:05:56.260 --> 00:06:04.190
So if I add this census map and
I turn on the sensors census

00:06:04.190 --> 00:06:10.170
WMS layers, you'll see that
in the San Francisco area,

00:06:10.170 --> 00:06:14.050
there is some road
data as well as

00:06:14.050 --> 00:06:18.479
some congressional
boundaries as well.

00:06:18.479 --> 00:06:20.020
DYLAN THOMAS: And
you can style this.

00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:24.266
This is something that you can
style ArcGIS to some extent,

00:06:24.266 --> 00:06:25.120
right?

00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:27.292
ALAN POOLE: So these are
just a standard WMS layers.

00:06:27.292 --> 00:06:29.000
DYLAN THOMAS: OK, so
they are pre-styled.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.125
ALAN POOLE: They're pre-styled
by the map publisher

00:06:31.125 --> 00:06:32.160
inside of Maps engine.

00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:36.681
The connectors work with
both raster layers and vector

00:06:36.681 --> 00:06:37.180
layers.

00:06:37.180 --> 00:06:39.900
And if you have Google
Maps engine maps with one

00:06:39.900 --> 00:06:42.390
to many layers, that
works fine as well.

00:06:42.390 --> 00:06:45.220
So let me demonstrate
the next piece

00:06:45.220 --> 00:06:46.920
of functionality in the map.

00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:51.990
So that's all search and kind
of visualization of your maps.

00:06:51.990 --> 00:06:57.080
But if I have some local
data that I want to upload,

00:06:57.080 --> 00:06:59.980
the Google Maps engine connector
allows you to do that as well.

00:06:59.980 --> 00:07:06.830
So I'm going to add a raster
layer and a shapefile that's

00:07:06.830 --> 00:07:09.800
locally available
in my repository.

00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:12.890
But this would work if
you had an enterprise Geo

00:07:12.890 --> 00:07:16.390
databases like an Oracle
spatial or a file Geo database.

00:07:16.390 --> 00:07:17.640
All that would work as well.

00:07:17.640 --> 00:07:19.306
DYLAN THOMAS: So it's
basically anything

00:07:19.306 --> 00:07:23.600
that the ArcGIS recognizes as a
feature class layer or a raster

00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:26.617
layer is going to be
fair game to upload.

00:07:26.617 --> 00:07:27.450
ALAN POOLE: Exactly.

00:07:27.450 --> 00:07:29.710
Any native format that
is supported by ArcMap.

00:07:29.710 --> 00:07:30.860
DYLAN THOMAS: Right.

00:07:30.860 --> 00:07:32.670
ALAN POOLE: And if
you add a layer,

00:07:32.670 --> 00:07:37.280
you'll note that the interact
button becomes active,

00:07:37.280 --> 00:07:39.640
and you can actually
interactively upload this data

00:07:39.640 --> 00:07:43.820
to your Google Maps
Engine account.

00:07:43.820 --> 00:07:49.720
So I'm going to
select the earth TIFF

00:07:49.720 --> 00:07:52.030
image that I've
added to my ArcMap.

00:07:52.030 --> 00:07:55.000
And you'll note that the
Upload button becomes active.

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:58.910
So I'm going to click on Upload
to Google Maps Engine which

00:07:58.910 --> 00:08:00.580
will pop up a dialogue.

00:08:00.580 --> 00:08:04.890
And you're asked to fill
in a couple of attributes

00:08:04.890 --> 00:08:07.350
about this upload
before you do so.

00:08:07.350 --> 00:08:10.100
So the first step is to select
a Google Maps engine an account

00:08:10.100 --> 00:08:11.960
that you have access to.

00:08:11.960 --> 00:08:14.920
I'm going to click
on altostrat demo.

00:08:14.920 --> 00:08:19.190
You have to name this asset, so
I'm going to call it WSI earth,

00:08:19.190 --> 00:08:24.710
give it a description, TIFF
image of the entire world,

00:08:24.710 --> 00:08:28.390
and give it a tag,
so earth image.

00:08:28.390 --> 00:08:29.900
And then the next
two are required,

00:08:29.900 --> 00:08:31.340
and they have to exist first.

00:08:31.340 --> 00:08:33.281
So you need to
have an access list

00:08:33.281 --> 00:08:34.780
that you're going
to upload this to.

00:08:34.780 --> 00:08:38.380
So I'm going to call
this connector editors

00:08:38.380 --> 00:08:42.970
and give it an attribution,
which we'll call it ESRI.

00:08:42.970 --> 00:08:44.670
So the connector
editors are the group

00:08:44.670 --> 00:08:46.920
of people that will have
access to this image

00:08:46.920 --> 00:08:48.530
once it's uploaded.

00:08:48.530 --> 00:08:51.660
So I'm going to click
on Upload files button.

00:08:51.660 --> 00:08:55.950
In the Google Maps Engine
connector for ArcGIS

00:08:55.950 --> 00:08:59.250
desktop is asking ArcMap
to convert this file

00:08:59.250 --> 00:09:02.740
to a standard format that can
be uploaded to the Google Maps

00:09:02.740 --> 00:09:04.270
Engine API.

00:09:04.270 --> 00:09:08.990
So if it's in some strange file
format that ArcMap understands,

00:09:08.990 --> 00:09:13.560
we will ask ArcMap to convert it
to something that is supported.

00:09:13.560 --> 00:09:16.290
And once it's
converted, we'll upload

00:09:16.290 --> 00:09:20.610
those files your Google
Maps Engine account.

00:09:20.610 --> 00:09:22.360
DYLAN THOMAS: That's
what's happening now.

00:09:22.360 --> 00:09:23.310
ALAN POOLE: That's what's
happening right now.

00:09:23.310 --> 00:09:25.730
DYLAN THOMAS: So in
terms of the API,

00:09:25.730 --> 00:09:28.870
we did a little bit of the
meta data work preparation

00:09:28.870 --> 00:09:31.520
to fill out your form
now you're doing a post

00:09:31.520 --> 00:09:35.520
using basically the new file
upload or asset creation

00:09:35.520 --> 00:09:36.090
endpoint.

00:09:36.090 --> 00:09:36.923
ALAN POOLE: Exactly.

00:09:36.923 --> 00:09:40.520
So first step was just to
request through the mass engine

00:09:40.520 --> 00:09:44.030
API a new asset and
then posting each file

00:09:44.030 --> 00:09:46.040
to the Maps Engine API.

00:09:46.040 --> 00:09:48.200
And the last step
is it opens it up

00:09:48.200 --> 00:09:51.950
in the map publishers interface
inside of Google Maps Engine.

00:09:51.950 --> 00:09:53.340
You can see it's
already starting

00:09:53.340 --> 00:09:55.719
to process for the map editor.

00:09:55.719 --> 00:09:57.760
DYLAN THOMAS: So I think
that sort of rounded out

00:09:57.760 --> 00:09:59.593
the workflow that we
wanted to share, right?

00:09:59.593 --> 00:10:01.390
Which is just simple
access through

00:10:01.390 --> 00:10:04.370
unauthorized authenticated
connection [INAUDIBLE],

00:10:04.370 --> 00:10:06.890
and the second one is being
able to actually push data

00:10:06.890 --> 00:10:09.930
into Maps engine, sort of,
like you said, publish once

00:10:09.930 --> 00:10:11.542
for you anywhere.

00:10:11.542 --> 00:10:14.000
The second interesting thing
we just want to cover briefly,

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:16.630
I guess, is that this is, in
fact, and open source project

00:10:16.630 --> 00:10:17.900
just like the QGIS one is.

00:10:17.900 --> 00:10:20.240
And it was written by
yourself up to this point.

00:10:20.240 --> 00:10:21.740
I was wondering if
you could tell us

00:10:21.740 --> 00:10:22.830
a little bit about that.

00:10:22.830 --> 00:10:25.670
Are you accepting pool requests?

00:10:25.670 --> 00:10:27.670
How do you see this
growing from here?

00:10:27.670 --> 00:10:34.140
ALAN POOLE: The Google Apps
Engine code for the ArcMap

00:10:34.140 --> 00:10:37.800
portion is written in
Microsoft.net C# which we think

00:10:37.800 --> 00:10:42.270
is very important for a
lot of GIS professionals.

00:10:42.270 --> 00:10:46.630
So the code is on the Google
Maps GitHub repository.

00:10:46.630 --> 00:10:51.590
So any person can take this code
as reference, or take this code

00:10:51.590 --> 00:10:53.190
and add to it.

00:10:53.190 --> 00:10:57.810
We are accepting contributions,
but we will take them closely,

00:10:57.810 --> 00:11:01.280
kind of guarded,
and we'll add them

00:11:01.280 --> 00:11:04.430
to the Google-controlled
compiled version that's

00:11:04.430 --> 00:11:06.293
on ArcGIS.com.

00:11:06.293 --> 00:11:08.840
So anyone is welcome
to participate

00:11:08.840 --> 00:11:10.960
in the open-source project.

00:11:10.960 --> 00:11:19.740
And if you're suggestions are
worth putting into the Google

00:11:19.740 --> 00:11:22.110
compiled version, we're
willing to do that as well.

00:11:22.110 --> 00:11:25.870
DYLAN THOMAS: So the
version that someone,

00:11:25.870 --> 00:11:28.310
anyone would download with
no knowledge of the code,

00:11:28.310 --> 00:11:29.430
no knowledge of
the API, they just

00:11:29.430 --> 00:11:31.070
want to download it to
work with my Maps Engine.

00:11:31.070 --> 00:11:33.403
That's going to be something
that we will build, compile

00:11:33.403 --> 00:11:35.820
and make sure is on ArcGIS.com.

00:11:35.820 --> 00:11:39.330
And if anyone wants to add to
that, we'll considerate it.

00:11:39.330 --> 00:11:41.990
If anyone want to fork
this, please go ahead.

00:11:41.990 --> 00:11:43.732
Learn from it and improve.

00:11:43.732 --> 00:11:44.690
ALAN POOLE: Absolutely.

00:11:44.690 --> 00:11:47.160
And if anyone's
developing in C#,

00:11:47.160 --> 00:11:51.520
this is a good reference case
for how you would implement

00:11:51.520 --> 00:11:56.880
this OAuth2 or file upload
or Google Maps Engine API

00:11:56.880 --> 00:11:57.464
functionality.

00:11:57.464 --> 00:11:58.296
DYLAN THOMAS: Great.

00:11:58.296 --> 00:12:00.600
Alan, thanks for taking the
time to show this to us.

00:12:00.600 --> 00:12:01.920
It's really exciting.

00:12:01.920 --> 00:12:04.700
I'm glad we've got the
commercial side of this

00:12:04.700 --> 00:12:06.870
and also the open-source
side on the QGIS.

00:12:06.870 --> 00:12:08.004
So thanks very much.

00:12:08.004 --> 00:12:09.920
And I think that's it
for "What in the World."

00:12:09.920 --> 00:12:12.130
We'll see you next time.
