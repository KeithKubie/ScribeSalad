00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:01.590
- [Instructor] In a previous video,

00:00:01.590 --> 00:00:05.240
we've introduced ourselves
to the idea of federalism

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:06.890
in the United States.

00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:09.950
At a high level, you could
view it as a contract

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:11.790
between a national government

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:14.390
and the states of which it is made,

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:17.710
but you could also view it as
a layered form of government

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:19.600
where you have your local government

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:21.810
and then layered on top of
that your state government

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:24.080
and then layered on top of
that your national government,

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:26.400
often referred to as
the federal government.

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:29.060
And we looked at the
example of a layered cake

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:31.322
but have said that over the
course of American history,

00:00:31.322 --> 00:00:33.730
the layers have gotten
more and more mixed,

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:35.580
more like a marbled cake.

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:39.760
And it's been mixed more in
the favor of the national

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:41.580
or the federal government,

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:46.140
even though certain powers were
historically more associated

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:49.720
with the states, as we will
see, there are several levers

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:51.630
that the federal government has used

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:54.950
in order to extend its
power into the domain

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:58.400
of what used to be associated
with primarily the states.

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:02.580
So one is the notion
of categorical grants.

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:06.320
So these are grants for a specific purpose

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:08.780
where the federal government
says, hey, states,

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:10.260
we're gonna give you some money,

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:11.660
but you've gotta use this money

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:14.070
in exactly the way that we're telling you.

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:17.840
Now, to be clear, not all
grants are categorical grants.

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:20.060
You have things like block grants

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:22.830
where the federal
government can give a grant

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:24.020
to a state and say, hey, use this

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:26.960
to generally improve the
safety of your citizens.

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:29.690
That would still give a
lotta leeway to the states.

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:32.600
But in categorical
grants, it's very specific

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:36.140
in terms of how the states
are to use that money,

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:38.010
even if historically it was something

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:40.140
where the states had the powers.

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:43.010
So an example of this would
be the federal program,

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:45.870
the Special Supplemental
Nutrition Assistance Program

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:48.557
for Women, Infants, and Children, or WIC.

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:52.680
And to get a idea of
how prescriptive it is,

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:56.170
here is an outline of the
program on the USDA website,

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:58.580
a federal government agency.

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:01.650
And if we go down here,
you can even see things

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:03.280
like income requirements,

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:06.070
and they'll be income
eligibility guidelines.

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:09.903
These are set by the federal
government, not by the states.

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:15.520
Along those lines, you also have mandates.

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:19.130
So a mandate is the federal
government tying funding

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:24.130
to one thing based on state
compliance with another thing.

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:27.590
For example, the National
Minimum Drinking Age Act,

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:32.590
which was passed in 1984,
ties federal highway funds

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:37.600
to states raising their
minimum drinking age to 21.

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:40.280
And I had direct experience with this act

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:42.270
when I was growing up in Louisiana.

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:44.170
Louisiana decided not to comply

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:46.900
by the National Minimum Drinking Age Act,

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:50.260
so the drinking age was 18,
but because they didn't comply,

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:52.830
they weren't getting as much
federal funding for highways,

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:55.610
and the highways weren't
as good as in other states.

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:57.510
So even though the
drinking age is something

00:02:57.510 --> 00:02:59.740
that might be considered a state power,

00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:02.410
the federal government
was able to exercise a lot

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:04.080
of influence on most states

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:06.970
by tying what the
federal government wanted

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:09.280
to highway funds.

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:11.380
Now, outside of these examples

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:14.820
of the federal government
tying state funds

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:18.520
to the states doing what the
federal government wants,

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:20.690
the federal government has also made use

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:24.990
of the U.S. Constitution in
order to broaden its powers.

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:29.170
In particular, the Commerce
Clause, Article I, Section 8.

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:30.500
You might remember, that's the part

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:33.250
where they say the
Congress shall have power,

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:36.320
and then they list a bunch of powers,

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:37.860
but one of them, the Commerce Clause,

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:40.410
is to regulate Commerce
with foreign Nations,

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:44.380
and among the several States,
and with the Indian Tribes.

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:47.110
And the key part of the Commerce Clause is

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:49.470
among the several States.

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:51.270
Over the course of American history,

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:54.890
this ability to regulate
interstate commerce,

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:56.510
commerce between states,

00:03:56.510 --> 00:03:59.000
the federal government has used that

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.580
to justify regulations and laws

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:04.750
that focus on issues that
may at first be perceived

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:08.580
as a state power but use the argument

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:12.320
that it affects interstate
commerce in order to regulate it.

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:13.620
And as you can imagine,

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:16.180
when you have free-flowing
commerce between states,

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:17.500
you have the same currency,

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:19.300
you don't have tariffs between states,

00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:21.580
many things that you
would traditionally view

00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:25.470
as the power of the
state, one could argue,

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:29.700
would have some influence
on interstate commerce.

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:33.890
One notable example of this
would be federal drug laws

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:38.130
where a state could decide
to, say, legalize marijuana,

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:40.870
but the federal government
can make it pretty difficult

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:44.330
by regulating how is that
marijuana transported?

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:47.940
Or where does the cash for
that marijuana get deposited?

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:49.940
Does it get deposited in a bank

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:52.370
that has associations
with the Federal Reserve

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:55.420
that needs to transfer that
money across state lines?

00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:58.590
So the Interstate Commerce
Clause has more influence

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:01.853
on state affairs than you
might initially think.
