Speaker 1:          00:02          Oh wait, you're listening.

Speaker 2:          00:08          You are listening to radio lab radio from W N y. S. C e. Yep.

Speaker 3:          00:19          Are you surprised that this is so popular? Am I surprised? You know what I'm surprised about? I'm surprised that, um, this morning I was walking to the subway and I was like, man, I want to listen to my k-pop playlist.

Speaker 4:          00:35          Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:38          I guess I'm a little surprised with that myself taking notes.

Speaker 4:          00:44          Robert [inaudible] fantastic.

Speaker 3:          00:49          And I did listen to it and it was amazing and I, it's just, it's undeniable.

Speaker 2:          00:54          Okay. I'm Jad Abumrad I'm Robert Krulwich, Radiolab [inaudible] oh, sorry. No, no, you go, no, no, no. Like today, a story from a reporter, Alex Young. Hi. Hi. We're just to set it up. This story for us connects to one we did a few podcasts ago about Gary Hart and the moment when, how we covered politics changed this story is about a similar change that's happening right now. Right in front of our eyes in South Korea. So we're like, we're going to travel a few thousand miles. Yeah. And in this one, all the usual dynamics you would expect in this kind of story get totally flipped. It's not about politics at this time. It's about music fans. Yeah. It's going to sound a little bit like a music pieces you've already heard, but really it's a puzzle. If you really admire someone and love them and so on. How much do you want to know about? About them? Really? Yeah. Is it tell me everything or tell me nothing. And if someone does try and tell you everything, at what point do you say, stop

Speaker 3:          02:02          you ready? I'm ready. Where do, where do you, where should we begin? Well, I think before we get to like the moment that I am very excited about, I need to kind of give you guys a little bit of of the world in which all of this is going to happen. Okay. And so we're going to start with this woman. When I tell my friends about it, I kind of describe it as a prison, but it's a prison you decide to walk into.

Speaker 3:          02:25          Okay. So this, this is Sarah Wolfgang. Um, I was a former trainee for Kate pop group in Korea. Um, and I'm here to talk about that. Sara is Korean American. She was born in America, but I actually grew up in Korea. Um, my parents both worked for the military. And you were living in soul? Correct. Okay. Yongsan Seoul and Sarah says that her whole k-pop adventure, it all started with her because when she was growing up, I really never liked school, so my parents were kind of wanting me to do something else. I think they still wanted me to finish

Speaker 2:          03:00          school, but they encouraged her to try out acting, to go to auditions, try out for school plays. And when I was in high school, about 15 years old, maybe 10th grade at her head shots ended up getting passed to a South Korean record company. And when we received the phone call, they were like, oh, hey, you want to come in and audition for a k pop group? And I was, uh, I actually denied it. I really didn't want to do it. Oh. But then she thought maybe this will lead to an acting job. So I went in and then they're like, okay, they put me in front of a camera and there they asked me to um, sing and I'm not the best singer, but that doesn't really matter to K-pop. Nope. Everything you know can be touched up really well. To make a long story short, they ended up offering her a contract of more than five years and as part of that contract, we were asked to move into the dorms.

Speaker 5:          03:54          [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          03:54          there are these facilities that all of the agencies have for further idols and training. They described it like a boarding school. All the kids kind of live together and so I moved to the dorms with six or seven other girls and it was here that Sarah says the company basically kept them under lock and key. Well, they didn't lock us in there, but we weren't allowed to leave. It's like one of those cockroach prisons or like those ant prisons you can walk in but you can't walk out. Why is she doing this again? Well thank you.

Speaker 4:          04:34          [inaudible]

Speaker 6:          04:34          let me explain to you guys just like how phenomenally huge k-pop is. K-Pop actually started in Korea in the early nineties, but like in the last five or so years,

Speaker 4:          04:45          it is just

Speaker 6:          04:48          build out into the rest of the world. And by some estimates it was generating like around $5 billion a year. And then if you throw in like k drama, k soap operas, um, which is called the, how you wave that, how you wave in 2012 was valued at $83 billion. Jesus. Yeah. And nearly all of this,

Speaker 3:          05:12          it's based on a kind of fantasy because k pop stars are, you know, products of fantasy world. That's Professor Souk Young Kim Theater Studies at University of California, Santa Barbara. I studied k-pop industry. You know, f stars are the embodied forms of Manga and enema and all these unrealistic figures that don't exist in real life. So they have to have really beautiful face, beautiful body, you know, excessively long legs, broad eyes, pale skin flowing hair. They are not the creature of this world. They shouldn't be, you know, they own, they can only exist in fantasy world

Speaker 6:          05:55          in that fantasy. That's what trying to manufacture

Speaker 2:          05:58          in those dorms, like they wanted us to lose weight. Um, so we would wake up at like four or 5:00 AM in the morning and then go hiking. Sarah says after the hike they'd come back eat breakfast, which usually consisted of lettuce, then they'd have dance classes, singing classes, and then we have lessons of, I think they're called like humble lessons where basically this guy would show up to the dorm and he would teach us to bow correctly. So like we would have to bow in unison. Um, so that we seem to as like one big happy group, they weren't allowed to have cell phones, no computers, nope. Or a relationship of any kind. All companies pretty much don't want you to be in a relationship. And in fact, one of the girl too can told me that in 2011,

Speaker 6:          06:43          the, one of the members of 21, which is like a whole group managed by YJ Entertainment, revealed that their management said they should not be dating before age 29.

Speaker 2:          06:57          What? Oh my God,

Speaker 6:          07:01          they shouldn't be dating because stars belong to the public. To the fence and

Speaker 2:          07:09          that was a thing. It was like a purity thing. No, that period. Angelic Virgin Madonna image. This by the way, is k-pop writer, a g park editor@largeatsoompi.com like girl groups. These are calling like nations fairies. You know, they had this pure Chast um, image to them and the boy bands too, because that being single makes them more marketable and appealing. And Adrian says that's, that's the main takeaway. Of course, there's all kinds of cultural observations that you can make about this, but the main driver here is economic. The founders of K-pop knew back in the early nineties that the fans would love the starves even more if the stars weren't just beautiful and perfect, but they also seemed somehow available. You would be surprised how many k-pop stars come out and be like, oh, I've never had my first kiss yet. And they're like 1920 years old. Kind of like, I have it on my first kiss.

Speaker 2:          08:02          Will it be with you? You know, in feeding the fantasy kind of thing. Way, way. Is that all that different than America? I mean, didn't you feel weirder or stranger or something or when, what's when like, I don't know, Catherine Zeta Jones married that guy. Whatever his name is. Yeah. I don't really wanna think about his name cause it, it changed things for me. Me Too. I didn't have that feeling. I mean I would come on you. Oh, you're always going on about Meryl Streep. She married by the way to me. But no, she doesn't know. She is married to a chill, very quiet man is a sculptor, you know? How does that make you feel? I look around. It just shows to see like what does he got through? I don't have no with that. My point is, is it that diff? I mean America, the American celebrity culture has fantasy woven into of course yet, but there's a big difference in Korea, that fantasy world. It is so extremely controlled, way more than in America according to Sooki on camp. And it's controlled not just by the agencies, by the fence to the extent that it defies all of our common sense. What do you mean? I'll give you an example. This one I heard from professor CQ and Kim and also writer Leslie. Tim Bucko. I'm the editor in chief of soul beats. It's a big k pop k entertainment site. Okay.

Speaker 6:          09:18          2008 there was this new girl group, girls generation halls, girls generation, girls generation is a nine member. All Girls Group. That was like hearing on like music shows and like variety shows being promoted as like the girl next door. I'll cute and you know like the ideal girlfriend kind of idea unless he says that on some of these shows girls generation would appear with boy bands, you know, who were also promoting at the same time. Groups such as super junior ss five oh one and devious k. Okay. So these three groups in various shows, they would be like standing next to each other on stage talking to each other during variety shows. And this is where we kind of get into the cultural stuff. There are several times when they're onstage with one or more of these boy bands and they're kind of taking the microphone from the host or whatever and kind of just nodding their head.

Speaker 6:          10:23          Whereas the boy bands are like doing these deep Babs, some of the fans are seeing this and they're thinking that's disrespectful. Why? Why would that be disrespectful? Well, the thinking is that since girls generation is a new group, they should be bound much more deeply than their soon bays or their, their seniors being, um, a rookie group is a big deal in Korea because seniority is something that people hold very strongly. And so as a rookie, you have to show deference to the superior, you know, senior groups, they're not showing respect. They're not showing deference just in the bowing. That's how some of the fans were taking it. But I mean, aside from all that, and this is the key, is that some of the fans thought that the girl's generation girls were flirting with some of the boy bands, like, you know, with these little side long glances or teasing them. And so that interaction

Speaker 2:          11:13          [inaudible] seeing that fans were very, very, very upset about that. And so all the fans of the three groups, the three boy bands got together and decided to do a black ocean. What is that?

Speaker 6:          11:26          Yeah. That we're going to get there. Fast forward to June 7th, 2008, all of those bands that were on those TV shows are playing this big k-pop concerts, this um, event called Dream Concert, a huge stadium show, like more than 40,000 fans. And um, the call souk young told me that there's one thing you need to know about fans, about k-pop fans at live events. They all light sticks

Speaker 7:          11:54          and they come in different colors cause each band has its own color. Super Junior for example, has blue. And when they appear on stage you see this light sticks waving in support of their stars on stage. So they played for while. And when ss five Oh one comes out, a whole place just turned to light. Green show goes on TV XQ comes to the stage. They were like the biggest band at the time. And then upload thousands and thousands of these ruby red literally lights. And at some point girls' generation takes the stage. And here's the thing, pretty much as soon as they walk on stage, all the people in the audience

Speaker 8:          12:45          turn off their light sticks. [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          12:48          what? Suddenly there was black out in the whole auditorium. Everybody stops clapping, screaming, silence. Were you saying like the whole, like everybody, 40,000 people? Yes. And if you look at look up pictures of it, it was a stadium performance. The entire stadium was black. No Way. Yes. Way. Look at this picture. Oh my God.

Speaker 4:          13:11          [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          13:12          well I are we looking at this? It's totally black. It's like a whole football stadium. This isn't photo-shopped or something. No. Cause if you look down in the corner you can kind of see the pink girls generation section. Oh yeah. There's a little, there's like a list of pink pink as their color. Yeah. And then everything else is black girls generation had to sing and dance to the silent crowd.

Speaker 4:          13:34          Oh.

Speaker 3:          13:36          Has anything like this ever happened before? Never. Well, how on earth did they pull that off? How could you get this many people doing the same thing? Okay. So the way that these shows happen, at least at these dream concerts is that different sections of the auditorium belong to different fan groups. Oh. So they sell it as Zeland seating. Right. So the fan clubs actually get to like dole out the tickets. Uh, and during the show there's this moment where some of the fan club leaders stood up and held up these signs that said, quiet

Speaker 2:          14:08          dude, this is that. This is that upsetting. Yeah. Do you understand about this robbery? Like it doesn't seem like the most weed. He soon I've ever heard a little blink of an eye, a little leaning forward, a little failured about, but that's just the difference again. Okay. Wait a second, if you, if you would allow me to frame for a second. So yeah. So what have we learned so far? We've learned that this is a global phenomenon mirror this well mate, it's a global phenomenon. Born of the nightmare of these stars who seem to be tightly held in check by everybody, the fans and the agencies. Everybody. That's what we know. So that's what we know. So, okay. And this sort of tight control is how it operated for quite a few decades. But, and this is why

Speaker 3:          14:52          I wanted to do this whole story in the first place just a couple years ago in walks to this guy and he just messes everything up.

Speaker 9:          15:03          Hey,

Speaker 3:          15:04          they are radio lab [inaudible]

Speaker 9:          15:06          yeah.

Speaker 3:          15:09          We sent an interpreter with a mic over to the Gangnam district and sold. Oh, they got numb style to speak with a guy named Leon young Goo JPM but you know, he told me to call him Mr. Lee. Hello? Hello. Hey. I hopped on the line from our studio in New York when I got started. Yeah. Are you guys ready? Yep. Okay. So here's the story.

Speaker 10:         15:31          Bozo Tacome [inaudible] early 2002 y'all need to put through retirement.

Speaker 3:          15:35          Mr. Lee, he was working at a news organization called sports soul, which did all kinds of things, not just sports. They also did like business and entertainment, dodgy. And then young [inaudible]. He was actually in charge of all the online news and while he was there, I think it's fair to say that he took his reporting very seriously. Like he always had this idea in his mind. Yeah.

Speaker 10:         16:00          One team, one [inaudible]. Who do I [inaudible]

Speaker 3:          16:03          I believe any contents that can be published that's possible to publish should be freely published. That's the kind of culture that would be better to have. So he was a guy who believed in an independent press, but he also knew that there were certain things that he just couldn't report on how it looks out of your soul. [inaudible] having gone that certain subjects like politics. Oh, your mother. We're just dangerous. We do. How, how, why, what is it, what you're talking about? We, we actually need to back up a little bit. Put this into a little bit of context. So between like after the Korean war, between say the 60s and the 80s, um, South Korea was under a series of military dictatorships. And there was basically a censorship of the press. Things got a lot better in the 90s when they turned to civilian rule. But even today, the government still has a branch that goes around the Internet and, and deletes websites, uh, for their content. So this is the, this is like the world in which the press is living in a Brazilian [inaudible]. So getting back to Mr. Lee, it's 2010. He's at sports soul having dreams of independence and he feels like politics is a little tricky. So he does what to me feels like a little bit of a Trojan horse moved. Have you all day titled Basically he says if I can't do independent reporting in politics, I'll just sneak it into celebrity news. Uh, so [inaudible] [inaudible]

Speaker 10:         17:36          and so we looked on the Internet for um, Hollywood news and media in the UK at [inaudible] Hall and looked at what they doing every

Speaker 6:          17:50          day. So he studied the sun, US weekly. TMZ wait, he studied TMC. That's what he said. You know how they take their pictures? How close do they get? Cause there isn't, there wasn't Paparazzi in Korea and we decided to apply that to South Korea. So what, what kind of tactics did you use to get the photos in the first place? She didn't publish it. You can go on board. We decided the best way to do the reporting is, you know, by hiding it

Speaker 3:          18:24          a car, their first target where these two stars, John Young, who is an idol from a boy band called shiny huge band and an actress, her name is Shinsei Kyung, TD Ritani is all, first you have to go through the information gathering process. So they tailed both the stars on and off for one month to get a sense of their movement patterns, you know, and they figure out, they have this pattern of meeting up in front of her apartment really early in the morning, like three in the morning or something. And they take [inaudible]

Speaker 11:         18:58          these walks.

Speaker 3:          19:00          So I've seen in TD detainees late October, 2010 it came to a point where we couldn't, we couldn't miss the opportunity. They call this, I guess they call this the De de [inaudible] dating a date, which I think is pretty funny. And on this particular day, one of Mr Lee's reporters, steaks out the apartment and the two stars meet up to take their walk.

Speaker 11:         19:21          Okay. And

Speaker 2:          19:25          you get the very first Paparazzi photos as far as we know in Korea. So these photos are, so what? I think they're so cute. It's these two idols, you know, walking down the street, hand in hand under these yellow streetlights and they just look like they're in their own little world. There's this one photo where he's pulling back her hair and I think he's putting like an earbud in her beer and they're, maybe they're sharing a song. They're listening to a song together. Oh, he's got her purse on his shoulder. You know, he's just holding her bag for her. What happens when the photographer guy runs up and goes, well, the, the guys at sports, so kind of drew this line. They're like, we're gonna keep back a distance from the celebrities coming through a car window. Right. Do they see the guy? No, they don't. And that's why these photos there, it's not like that typical like hands in the face photo. They just look totally serene this moment. These two innocent, innocent, they have no reason to expect anyone to be out there. Right. Because you know, before this moment there weren't Paparazzi photographers stalking celebrities like this. This is Eden right here. This is Eden.

Speaker 3:          20:35          Yeah. This is before the fall. [inaudible] Mr. Lee said right before they published, um, and this has sort of become their tradition. All of the reporters got together and stayed in the office all night and everybody was on pins and needles because you know, they didn't know. They didn't know what was gonna happen. Are people going to be outraged or are they gonna be totally excited about this? They just had no idea what was going to happen. And you also will have no idea what's going to happen until after the break.

Speaker 4:          21:12          Yeah.

Speaker 12:         21:16          Hey, this is mark from a story of Queens. Radiolab is supported in part by the Alfred p Sloan Foundation, enhancing public understanding of science and technology in the modern world. More information aboutSloan@wwwdotsloan.org

Speaker 13:         21:33          I'm Bessie music. I hosted esoterical talk show in Egypt after the Arab spring until the government tried to throw me in jail. So now I live in America and I host the podcast remade in America, presented by cafe where I interview all kinds of outsiders from comedian Maz. You run to journalist Maria in a wholesale and filmmaker here in view. And I try to use those conversations to figure out my new country American subscribe to remade in America, presented by Cafe Jad Robert Radiolab.

Speaker 3:          22:10          Back to our story from reporter Alex Young. So when we left off, we were talking about leaving Gu. So you need Mr. Lee and he and his team had just captured the first Paparazzi moment in South Korea. They had taken a picture of these two stars [inaudible] the photos were pretty dark and super grainy, totally pop brought style like shot in night, probably from a zoom lens like thousands of yards away come [inaudible] it was hard to tell the photographs really?

Speaker 13:         22:43          [inaudible]

Speaker 3:          22:43          so he says that they all got together in their office. They were just about to publish no idea what was gonna happen. And when we first published them, nothing really. Really? Yeah, seriously. Oh, come on, I'm kidding. There was general response

Speaker 4:          23:03          [inaudible]

Speaker 3:          23:04          people went crazy. Oh my goodness. Oh my goodness.

Speaker 4:          23:10          [inaudible] the photos went viral. It just took the whole country [inaudible] there wasn't an incredible amount of web traffic down there go so much that our servers were breaking down. So people clicked.

Speaker 3:          23:28          Oh yeah. When it all comes down to it, people really want to know. At first they just, you know, they just inundated the website, uh, trying to look at these photos. But then they were like, oh, oh no. So then they rushed over to the fan sites and four of the websites from the, the boy band, the guy crashed, shouldn't say [inaudible] Young's website, which is called the mini humpy page. It just gets flooded with comments or his file comments about how the fence felt. Betrayed. People were like posting deface pictures of her in typical, um, sexist ways. She got the brunt of it. This is always the way it is, right? Just like in America, that's the way it happens. In Korea. [inaudible] put [inaudible], you know, when I talked to Lehman Goo, he was the first one to recognize that you ain't going pylon. And Pennzoil usually when this kind of scandal breaks, it's the, it's the woman who gets it worse. Yeah. Yeah. What, so where would the, how we do, how did the agencies respond? [inaudible] shock in the beginning to tell that the companies were not prepared because their official statement would be like, we've talked to the celebrity about this or we had no idea this was going on. And you could see that the companies were struggling. There's actually, you know, a couple times later on where

Speaker 6:          24:46          God, the fans got really crazy and they would actually protest at like their live shows or whatever. Um, and then pretty much the next day, like after the protest, the idol at the center of that scramble would just

Speaker 3:          25:01          kind of vanish. Like they would just take a indefinite hiatus from all of their, like promotional activities. Like you mean like the agencies just Yank them? I mean, yeah, that was the suggestion. Yeah. Did the agency say anything about that to you? No one would go on the record with me, but I did talk to some people over email and they said that, you know, when fans react this way, they're kind of forced to take drastic action. So they kind of confirmed that they were disappearing idols. They confirmed with me that they were uh, taking action. But here's what ends up happening and we'll tell you [inaudible] more than just calling you says, you know that very first scandal that they broke. Yeah, they got a lot of backlash, but it showed them

Speaker 6:          25:45          that [inaudible] worked in the foreign media could also work in South Korea. [inaudible] so it gave us strength to keep experimenting. So in 2011, Lehman Goo and like a couple of the people from sports, all they break off and they formed this company called dispatch. And then the [inaudible]

Speaker 3:          26:04          following years, 2012 2013 this is this really important chunks

Speaker 6:          26:09          time where they just start pumping out scandals and getting them. Gen Docs must've done more than 10 stories. Small and baby. Do you want to hit list? I do want to hit the list for stuff. There's parks Gian, she's dating Mr p Hora with John Young. Then tack Jaan who gets caught with Jessica brain dating Kim t and you have Yuna dating Lisa Sankey Selling Chisholm. That was like a crazy one. And of course we all remember Beck, Yan and [inaudible], I don't remember. Oh, I remember it. But according to

Speaker 3:          26:43          seek in Kim, you had so many scandals in such a short period of time, headlines after headlines, headlines at such a frequent rate, that fence became somehow desensitized

Speaker 2:          27:00          by this news. It shook us and I'm going to put myself in there now. Yeah, it should go. So according to writer Aga Park, what you saw after this crazy onslaught of scandals is um, well a couple of things. So the Paparazzi became a trend. Something that all the crane entertainment news started picking up. There starts to be all these other Paparazzi companies that come out competitors. Exactly. Just like dispatch, but with a different name. But the craziest part I think is that you start seeing celebrities tiptoeing out and telling the truth about their lives. Little by little, the celebrities would get more comfortable about revealing it themselves. For instance, in 2012 on this talk show

Speaker 3:          27:42          [inaudible] who is a member of this k-pop boy band, he made ways, because he explained that celebrities dating cards in order to get away from all these new Paparazzi, they parked by the Han River and they have their dates there and there are parking lots where multiple celebrities park and have their secret dates inside the car. This is something that people always sort of suspected was the case, but it was Kinda like the first time it was just out in the open like that. And I think that that

Speaker 2:          28:19          audience reaction is like super telling.

Speaker 3:          28:23          You can hear it in the tape there. They're laughing.

Speaker 2:          28:25          So he's breaking the spell and what you expect is, yeah, what you get is casual laughter. That's a sea change. That's a real CJ. So this happened in just two years. You're saying? We probably have to say five years. You have. It's still, I mean, that's, see this actually does make me think, I mean, well first of all, it's interesting to think of Paparazzi as liberator's in this game. Totally. Totally. Because we used to think of them as like scum, but, uh, I mean if you pan out, here's literally the thought I'm having. Like there's a tendency, cause we're done westerners to sort of see what happens in places like Korea as being very different from us. Like culturally separate. Yeah. With the city to hear that they change that quickly makes me think in some way that we're all very similar or maybe we're all headed to the same place. I'm like, tabloid is the great equalizer. And maybe we were all gonna just end up all of us in Postcard Dashi and hell, like literally like this is how far they traveled in five years and literally in another five years you will have the Kardashian family of Korea dishes all the time and we're making sex tapes on their own, whatever it is. I also thought the same thing, you know, being from America, you were like, Whoa, this is just inevitable. But, um, I actually don't think so anymore. Aga told

Speaker 3:          29:41          me a story that really changed my mind. Uh, it was like, it was our Watergate was our k-pop gate. It was, it changed everything. Um, this story, it, it revolves around [inaudible].

Speaker 6:          29:53          You're still going to do that. This one young female solo artist [inaudible]

Speaker 3:          30:01          she's, she's just hugely popular.

Speaker 6:          30:05          I mean, they actually call her the Korean Beyonce and in 2013 she was just killing it yet by this point, Eylea has a couple albums out. Her youtube videos have millions and millions of views, but then wait a minute.

Speaker 3:          30:24          November, 2013, a bomb drops.

Speaker 7:          30:28          Oh, that's [inaudible]

Speaker 3:          30:32          what happens is this, this guy cold calls dispatch. Mr. Lee actually picks up and he recorded this phone call between them and the guy tells him I have nude pictures of Ailey

Speaker 7:          30:45          [inaudible] yeah. That's really tells the guy watching the video. We need to know how you obtained these guy says [inaudible] okay. I received them. Okay. The Sukkot, you want to buy this from glio somehow [inaudible] yeah. The singer [inaudible] the singer gave them to you? Yes. Real. Why? [inaudible] I was her boyfriend.

Speaker 3:          31:12          What is exactly as he asked you. So, so he's calling dispatch to see how much these nude photos are worth about [inaudible] and when I was talking to Mr. Lee about this, he said that in that moment when he was on the phone with [inaudible] Tinika as a reporter, I was greedy about the story and the information. He said that he wanted those pictures. But what he ended up telling the guy is,

Speaker 7:          31:39          uh, to the [inaudible] in the, we don't want your photos. [inaudible] and then if you keep listening to the sound call, you can hear him with Hello Phil. We have that just [inaudible]

Speaker 3:          31:53          start getting really upset with the ex boyfriend. Like this is not right. You're crossing a line. So to make a long story short, um, dispatch turns down the photos and the photos somehow make their way to a competitor's website. This one American k-pop website called all K-pop, who is, um, pretty big. They are probably the number one k-pop site at that time in the world yet or free for English speakers, English speaker, um, the published and they get picture of, they're the ones who publish the, the naked pictures, remember if they sent it or not. But if they did it wasn't a very good job like you could see. So the photos come out and what would you expect to happen? Um, some anger maybe a little bit and then basically people just click on the pictures. No, what actually happens is instantly the entire k pops world bands together, black ocean style and just comes out against all k-pop. The agencies, they start threatening to sue. This competitor website starts this boycott and in just a few days the figure was like 22,000 Twitter followers just stopped following them. Really their, their reputation

Speaker 7:          33:04          tanks.

Speaker 3:          33:05          It was a warning to them, you know, don't mess with us. And so, um, they really haven't re, I mean I haven't really followed them in awhile but they haven't recovered since then. But what I think is the most surprising part of this is just three days after the photos come out

Speaker 7:          33:20          [inaudible]

Speaker 3:          33:21          the night of one of South Korea's biggest awards ceremonies called the melon music awards

Speaker 7:          33:28          and

Speaker 3:          33:29          so yours are, you know, scheduled for that night. Aly was supposed to receive one of these top 10 artists of the year awards and I think to everyone's surprise, she actually showed up [inaudible] go are the top 10 in about two hours in I end the io elite.

Speaker 7:          33:51          [inaudible] no know they call her name and she stands up, walks the center stage, he goes to the presenters, she takes a bow and she looks, I think she looks fraught or at least overwhelmed, but then she faces the crowd, right?

Speaker 4:          34:12          [inaudible]

Speaker 7:          34:18          at one point her face crack and she puts her head in her elbow and she starts crying.

Speaker 4:          34:29          Ooh,

Speaker 7:          34:32          so the sum total and ammonia, does she go, she says, it really means a lot to me that you supported me, that you believed in me. We go to, she go, despite everything that's going on, [inaudible] comes home. Nida, thank you. It's Vegas. And then she walked off stage

Speaker 3:          35:12          for me. The story shows that they're going to draw a line in the sand that's different from ours for now. For a long time or can you say, I mean when I asked a j park the same question, do you think that it's going to go the way of the West? I mean she said no way. I don't think it's ever going to be that way. I know, I mean culturally Koreans were a little more strict and

Speaker 2:          35:38          also a, I think there's also a part where we look at these us and we're like, come on guys. You know like we see them as an example of let's not totally go there.

Speaker 14:         35:47          Okay.

Speaker 2:          35:49          Yeah. So like the u s is a cautionary tale or something like don't ever get to that point guys.

Speaker 15:         35:56          And maybe this is one of those ones where you really wonder like is there a cultural difference that runs deep enough that you can say [inaudible] to your, the part of you that said, I want to know. I want to see, I want to hear. And I think that that ultimately there might be a culture, I don't know, something Paul, part of me thinks that is as the, as the, when it gets so easy to know the most intimate details about anyone we'll all give in. I know this part of me, it just feels that way. But humans. Yeah, I dunno. I have to go with Robert on this one. Well, I'm,
