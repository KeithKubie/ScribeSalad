00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:04.970
&gt;&gt; Speaker One: From the Library
of Congress in Washington DC.

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:20.170
&gt;&gt; Ann Brener: Good afternoon.

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:24.390
On behalf of Mary-Jane
Deeb, Chief of the African

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:27.350
and Middle Eastern Division,
I would like to welcome you

00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:29.360
to the Library of Congress.

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:31.660
My name is Ann Brener
and I'm a specialist

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:35.160
in the Hebraic Section, here.

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:39.570
In the spring of 2017 the
Library of Congress learned

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:42.540
of an extraordinary
treasure on the market,

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:44.520
a most unique ancient fragment

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:47.510
from the biblical
book of Exodus.

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:49.700
Just how unique you'll
soon be hearing

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:52.190
from our wonderful speaker.

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:54.260
Now, the story of Exodus is one

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:57.580
of the foundational
texts of Western culture.

00:00:57.580 --> 00:01:00.500
It is woven into the American
narrative about freedom

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:04.310
and it resonates powerfully
in American history.

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:06.160
What could be more
fitting, therefore,

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:08.820
than to bring this ancient
treasure to the Library

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:12.070
of Congress, the national
library of the nation founded

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:14.880
on the principle of freedom?

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:17.900
Now, the ancient
treasure is actually here.

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:20.000
And for this, we have to
thank the people at the helm

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.720
of the library, the ones who
make the actual decisions

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:25.530
on what to apply and what not.

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:28.620
It takes more, I think, than
the power of the purse to make

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:31.100
to make that kind of decision.

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:34.280
To quote from the Hebrew poem
written by a grateful poet

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:38.010
to this patron over thousand
years ago in medieval Spain,

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:40.090
''It also takes heart
and mind and eye.''

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:43.590
And those words remain
true, today.

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:46.840
Please, join me, therefore,
in making Mary-Jane Deeb,

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:49.820
the Chief of the African
and Middle Eastern Division,

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:51.890
Beacher Wiggins,
Director of Acquisitions

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:53.190
and Bibliographic Access.

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:57.530
And most of all, I
think, Helena Zinkham,

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:59.480
Director of Collections
and Services.

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:03.960
Without them we wouldn't be
celebrating here to today.

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:07.550
Today's speaker also played
an important role behind

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:09.010
the scenes.

00:02:09.010 --> 00:02:10.710
It was to him I turned
when I first learned

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:14.110
of this ancient scroll sheet
and it was his expertise

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:17.640
that guided me during
the crucial first stage.

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:20.280
For this reason, I am
delighted, doubly delighted,

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:22.280
that the day has finally come

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:25.550
when we can welcome Professor
Rendsburg into our meeting room

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:29.250
and hear more about
our new treasure.

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:34.200
In addition to being my
own special consultant Gary

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:36.850
Rosenburg, Rendsburg is
a distinguished professor

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:40.390
of Jewish history at
Rutgers University,

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:41.690
where he holds the Blanche

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:44.350
and Irving Laurie Chair
in Jewish History.

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:48.650
He is author of seven books of
Biblical literature and language

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:51.810
and about 170 articles.

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:54.370
That's one seven zero.

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:56.540
Perhaps, his best-known
book is the Bible

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:58.310
and Ancient Near
East co-authored

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:01.480
with the late Sirus Gordon.

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:05.660
He has also produced two DVDs
for The Great Courses program,

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:09.860
one on the book of Genesis and
one on the Dead Sea Scrolls.

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:14.240
He is, also, my former professor
from graduate school in Cornell

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:16.940
and I'm sure is grading
me today.

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:20.510
So, please join me in welcoming
Professor Gary Rendsburg.

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:26.720
[ Applause ]

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:28.020
&gt;&gt; Gary Rendsburg: Thank
you, very much, Ann,

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:32.170
for those very kind words and
it's such a pleasure to be here.

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:34.300
And as you said, you
use the word celebrate.

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:40.440
It's truly a time of celebration
to reflect on the arrival

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:46.580
of the remarkable 1,000-year-old
Torah scroll sheet now here

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:48.310
at the Library of Congress.

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:52.230
The oldest Torah scroll
sheet in the world,

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:54.950
complete Torah scroll
sheet in the world,

00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:57.250
legible to the naked eye.

00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:00.920
And that's how we can define
this treasure that is now part

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:03.730
of the Library of Congress.

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:08.170
So, let's discuss
how it got here,

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:10.920
why it's so important,
why it's so unique.

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:16.620
And just join me for this
amazing beautiful ride.

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:23.890
So, as Ann said, in
last spring in May 2017,

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:26.580
she sends me an email
and she says,

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:29.320
''Would you please take
a look at this catalog?''

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:31.730
And these are some
snippets from this catalog,

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:34.990
''The 19th Century Rare
Book and Photograph Shop''.

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:38.470
And they have offices in
both Brooklyn, New York

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:42.950
and Stevenson just outside
of Baltimore, Maryland.

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:47.670
''And please, go look at
this item, in particular,

00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:53.710
on page 129 of the
catalog.'' Which I do.

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:56.130
And I read it and it
says, as you can see here,

00:04:56.130 --> 00:04:58.060
that is all we have to go on.

00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:01.320
Exodus 1010 through 1615.

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:04.940
Complete biblical
scroll sheet in Hebrew.

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:09.910
A Torah scroll panel, Middle
East, tenth or 11th century.

00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:13.030
And then, a more
detailed description.

00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:16.850
So, when I see this, and I'll
just close, give you a close-up

00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:21.450
on the most important part
of the catalog description.

00:05:21.450 --> 00:05:23.980
I know, immediately, what it is.

00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:26.740
And that's because those
of us who work in the field

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:29.090
of Hebrew manuscripts keep
track of these things.

00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:32.040
We certainly know where they
are in public collections,

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:35.090
in libraries, and
museums around the world.

00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:36.950
And even, those which
are in private hands,

00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:39.450
we learn about from
time to time.

00:05:39.450 --> 00:05:44.100
This one was sold at
Christie's in London in 2001,

00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:45.890
and therefore, I knew about it.

00:05:45.890 --> 00:05:50.240
But, of course, one never
knows who the seller is

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:52.890
or who the buyer is
in such private sales

00:05:52.890 --> 00:05:55.810
through auction houses like
Christie's or Sotheby's

00:05:55.810 --> 00:05:58.800
and other such institutions
in the world.

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:01.000
Now, that I know
exactly what it was.

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:02.910
I had a pretty good
hint, but of course,

00:06:02.910 --> 00:06:06.620
I didn't remember Exodus
1010 through Exodus 1615.

00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:08.290
I said that must be it, but I

00:06:08.290 --> 00:06:10.410
of course went back
and double checked.

00:06:10.410 --> 00:06:11.910
And indeed, it was.

00:06:11.910 --> 00:06:14.500
Why did I know about it?

00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:17.780
Because, kudos to Jordan
Penkower, my colleague

00:06:17.780 --> 00:06:20.480
at Bar Ilan University
in Israel.

00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:23.340
Who, in the year 2002 was able

00:06:23.340 --> 00:06:26.370
to publish a very
long detailed article

00:06:26.370 --> 00:06:29.260
about the Torah scroll
sheet that is now here

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:30.560
at the Library of Congress.

00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:36.010
Which, is to say when it was
for auction in London in 2001,

00:06:36.010 --> 00:06:39.060
he as an expert in
medieval Hebrew manuscripts

00:06:39.060 --> 00:06:42.690
and Torah scrolls, in
particular, was invited to come

00:06:42.690 --> 00:06:44.020
to London to study it.

00:06:44.020 --> 00:06:45.770
So, that it would, at
least, be available

00:06:45.770 --> 00:06:47.570
for the scholarly world.

00:06:47.570 --> 00:06:49.430
Even though, it would,
presumably, be purchased

00:06:49.430 --> 00:06:52.100
by somebody in private
hands as it was.

00:06:52.100 --> 00:06:54.460
And here is his description
of it, exactly,

00:06:54.460 --> 00:06:57.550
with the same verse, of
course, that are in the catalog

00:06:57.550 --> 00:06:59.150
that we just looked at.

00:06:59.150 --> 00:07:01.010
And the same dimensions
and so on.

00:07:01.010 --> 00:07:04.430
So, I confirmed by looking
at Jordan Penkower's article

00:07:04.430 --> 00:07:08.480
from 16, at that
time, 15 years ago,

00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:10.370
that this was, indeed,
the sheet.

00:07:10.370 --> 00:07:12.030
And I emailed Ann back.

00:07:12.030 --> 00:07:14.890
I think her email to me was
something like, ''Is this real?

00:07:14.890 --> 00:07:16.190
Is this possible?

00:07:16.190 --> 00:07:19.300
It's too good to be true.''
Is was something like that.

00:07:19.300 --> 00:07:20.890
And I wrote her and I said.

00:07:20.890 --> 00:07:22.550
''This is real.

00:07:22.550 --> 00:07:25.430
Buy it if you can.'' Right.

00:07:25.430 --> 00:07:27.460
Obviously, okay.

00:07:27.460 --> 00:07:30.430
And Ann already described
the processes, of course,

00:07:30.430 --> 00:07:33.940
at any institution, as
we are all aware of,

00:07:33.940 --> 00:07:36.520
of how such a thing
needs to be obtained.

00:07:36.520 --> 00:07:39.180
Pardon? Right.

00:07:39.180 --> 00:07:44.940
So, it was purchased by the
library, as we've just heard.

00:07:44.940 --> 00:07:48.130
Now, Penkower published, when
he published his very long,

00:07:48.130 --> 00:07:53.350
detailed article, two very
not so good photos from,

00:07:53.350 --> 00:07:55.900
I don't know if he took
them with his own camera.

00:07:55.900 --> 00:08:00.460
Black and white photos
from 2001, 2002.

00:08:00.460 --> 00:08:04.040
And these are the two photos
he took, and a portion

00:08:04.040 --> 00:08:08.190
of column three and a
portion of column five,

00:08:08.190 --> 00:08:09.710
just to give us a sense.

00:08:09.710 --> 00:08:11.790
Now, column five is
the important one

00:08:11.790 --> 00:08:14.680
because as you see there,
while the entire text,

00:08:14.680 --> 00:08:17.050
and I'll show it to you,
again, in a few moments,

00:08:17.050 --> 00:08:20.710
is written out in prose.

00:08:20.710 --> 00:08:24.780
The portion of Exodus 15
known as the Song of the Sea,

00:08:24.780 --> 00:08:28.480
Shirat Ha Yam in Hebrew,
is written out in poetry.

00:08:28.480 --> 00:08:31.340
And it's a very well-known
poetic structure

00:08:31.340 --> 00:08:34.820
that biblical text
of Torah scrolls

00:08:34.820 --> 00:08:40.030
of this particular song
use the poetic style.

00:08:40.030 --> 00:08:42.610
So, there you see some of
the handwriting up close

00:08:42.610 --> 00:08:47.270
and personal in images which
are taken some years ago.

00:08:47.270 --> 00:08:52.110
I also went online and there
is an auction record of it

00:08:52.110 --> 00:08:56.660
from this invaluable.com,
which you know,

00:08:56.660 --> 00:08:59.070
tracks and keeps records
of all these things.

00:08:59.070 --> 00:09:01.490
And again, a very poor
image on the left,

00:09:01.490 --> 00:09:05.570
upper left there you can see
of the of scroll fragment.

00:09:05.570 --> 00:09:08.910
And on the right, a
bilingual inscription.

00:09:08.910 --> 00:09:10.930
I'll show you a better
copy in a moment.

00:09:10.930 --> 00:09:14.850
In Russian and in Hebrew,
which gives us a clue as to

00:09:14.850 --> 00:09:18.510
where it was, at least
in the year 1863.

00:09:18.510 --> 00:09:21.690
And that inscription is
on the back of the scroll.

00:09:21.690 --> 00:09:27.260
We learned from this
that it was presented

00:09:27.260 --> 00:09:29.900
by a man named Shelomo Beim.

00:09:29.900 --> 00:09:35.430
He was the Karaite Hazzan in
the Crimea in the 19th century.

00:09:35.430 --> 00:09:38.790
We know about him from
other sources, as well.

00:09:38.790 --> 00:09:41.570
So, the Karaites
are a group of Jews

00:09:41.570 --> 00:09:45.110
who do not follow the
rabbinic approach.

00:09:45.110 --> 00:09:47.590
The rabbinical movement
which arose in the second

00:09:47.590 --> 00:09:51.070
and third century CE has
been the dominant one

00:09:51.070 --> 00:09:52.490
down to the present day.

00:09:52.490 --> 00:09:56.090
And all modern streams of
Judaism, orthodox, conservative,

00:09:56.090 --> 00:09:58.030
reform, Reconstructionist,

00:09:58.030 --> 00:10:01.400
and now in the 21st century
renewal, and everything else.

00:10:01.400 --> 00:10:03.640
Are all based on the
rabbinic system as laid

00:10:03.640 --> 00:10:07.580
out by the classical rabbis in
the Mishnah and the Talmidim.

00:10:07.580 --> 00:10:10.060
The Karaites have a totally
different approach to Judaism

00:10:10.060 --> 00:10:13.740
which does not use the rabbinic
system and they are a community

00:10:13.740 --> 00:10:16.970
of about 50,000 down
to the present day.

00:10:16.970 --> 00:10:18.830
Mainly in Israel,
but once upon a time,

00:10:18.830 --> 00:10:21.030
spread out throughout
the near East.

00:10:21.030 --> 00:10:25.930
Large communities in Egypt and
in parts of Russia, as well,

00:10:25.930 --> 00:10:28.600
both in Lithuania and next door.

00:10:28.600 --> 00:10:31.430
So, this is Shelomo
Beim, a Karaite Hazzan,

00:10:31.430 --> 00:10:32.850
leader of the community.

00:10:32.850 --> 00:10:35.970
I think Hazzan in the Karaite
system means less the canter

00:10:35.970 --> 00:10:37.270
in the synagogue, but rather,

00:10:37.270 --> 00:10:39.380
the one who oversees
the community.

00:10:39.380 --> 00:10:42.910
And he gave it as a gift to
the Grand Duke Constantine,

00:10:42.910 --> 00:10:47.340
the brother of Czar
Alexander II in the year 1863.

00:10:47.340 --> 00:10:50.490
That's what the Russian and
Hebrew inscription says.

00:10:50.490 --> 00:10:52.180
And again, I'll show you
a better image of it.

00:10:52.180 --> 00:10:54.550
We now have a very
good image of it.

00:10:54.550 --> 00:10:57.990
So, it tells us, of course,
that this was there in 1863.

00:10:57.990 --> 00:10:59.290
How did it get there?

00:10:59.290 --> 00:11:02.800
According to Penkower and
everybody else who's seen it,

00:11:02.800 --> 00:11:05.330
it is written in
the Middle East.

00:11:05.330 --> 00:11:09.490
That is to say, we can tell
handwritings and we divide them

00:11:09.490 --> 00:11:11.490
up into various geographical
zones.

00:11:11.490 --> 00:11:13.750
Spain, which we call
the Sephardic one.

00:11:13.750 --> 00:11:16.460
Europe which we call northern
Europe, the Ashkenazi one.

00:11:16.460 --> 00:11:17.870
The Yemenite one.

00:11:17.870 --> 00:11:20.310
And this would be the
Middle Eastern hand.

00:11:20.310 --> 00:11:23.170
And it's pretty clear that
it came from the Middle East.

00:11:23.170 --> 00:11:25.710
And based on other
elements, we know that it's

00:11:25.710 --> 00:11:28.270
about 1,000 years old.

00:11:28.270 --> 00:11:33.100
So, when I was here in the
October 2017, it was still,

00:11:33.100 --> 00:11:35.520
it had recently arrived
and it was still

00:11:35.520 --> 00:11:39.900
in its original glass
case and frame.

00:11:39.900 --> 00:11:42.350
So, you get a sense of
what it looked like.

00:11:42.350 --> 00:11:44.410
And notice all the folds.

00:11:44.410 --> 00:11:49.810
Right. So, how do we retrace
the story of this scroll?

00:11:49.810 --> 00:11:54.620
Now, here you see it today
after it's been stabilized,

00:11:54.620 --> 00:11:57.860
not yet fully conserved,
but at least stabilized.

00:11:57.860 --> 00:12:00.500
And I want to draw
attention to Yasmeen Khan,

00:12:00.500 --> 00:12:02.270
who is sitting here
in the front row.

00:12:02.270 --> 00:12:05.320
Conservator here at the library,
who will be doing further work

00:12:05.320 --> 00:12:07.630
on the conservation
of this scroll

00:12:07.630 --> 00:12:10.990
in the weeks and months ahead.

00:12:10.990 --> 00:12:14.370
And here you have
the before and after.

00:12:14.370 --> 00:12:16.300
Now, I wrote before
and after conservation

00:12:16.300 --> 00:12:17.950
because I thought this
was already conserved,

00:12:17.950 --> 00:12:20.400
since it looked so good to
my eye in the photograph.

00:12:20.400 --> 00:12:22.120
But there Yasmeen
tells me no, it hasn't,

00:12:22.120 --> 00:12:23.570
actually, been conserved, yet.

00:12:23.570 --> 00:12:25.150
This is the stabilization.

00:12:25.150 --> 00:12:28.330
And at least, to get it onto
display, since it was on display

00:12:28.330 --> 00:12:34.050
in the Great Hall, here at the
library back in March and April.

00:12:34.050 --> 00:12:35.940
So, it looks like
to me, to my eye,

00:12:35.940 --> 00:12:38.070
that this has already been
put on the ironing board,

00:12:38.070 --> 00:12:41.290
don't try this at
home, and smoothed out.

00:12:41.290 --> 00:12:43.830
But apparently, there is still
much more work to be done.

00:12:43.830 --> 00:12:45.760
So, what are all
the folds about?

00:12:45.760 --> 00:12:48.290
Right. I mean, would,
we have no knowledge.

00:12:48.290 --> 00:12:51.770
We don't know how it
got from Russia in 1863,

00:12:51.770 --> 00:12:55.170
where it was, to London in 2001.

00:12:55.170 --> 00:12:57.150
But, I'll come back
and give you, at least,

00:12:57.150 --> 00:12:59.770
some speculation about that.

00:12:59.770 --> 00:13:01.070
Here's the note.

00:13:01.070 --> 00:13:02.370
You can see it much better now.

00:13:02.370 --> 00:13:06.590
Mainly in Russian,
but, also, some Hebrew

00:13:06.590 --> 00:13:12.560
and giving us the details,
which I described a moment ago.

00:13:13.870 --> 00:13:16.210
On the back of the, of
the back of the scroll.

00:13:16.210 --> 00:13:17.990
It's on the back of
the scroll, correct.

00:13:17.990 --> 00:13:19.290
Yeah, okay.

00:13:19.290 --> 00:13:21.670
Now, let me introduce you
to one of the great figures

00:13:21.670 --> 00:13:25.010
of Jewish history,
Abraham Firkovich.

00:13:25.010 --> 00:13:28.060
He was a hakham, a
wise man, literally.

00:13:28.060 --> 00:13:29.970
Meaning a leader of
the Karaite community.

00:13:29.970 --> 00:13:31.690
And those are the
years of his life.

00:13:31.690 --> 00:13:35.300
You can see that he lived
to be almost 100 years, no,

00:13:35.300 --> 00:13:37.360
to be almost 90 years old.

00:13:37.360 --> 00:13:41.660
And he is famous because
throughout the 19th century,

00:13:41.660 --> 00:13:44.850
he left Russia where he
was from, Karaite community

00:13:44.850 --> 00:13:46.160
that I just described.

00:13:46.160 --> 00:13:48.030
And he traveled throughout
the near East,

00:13:48.030 --> 00:13:52.480
and he brought back
manuscripts by huge numbers.

00:13:52.480 --> 00:13:56.340
Treasures of things that
had never been seen before

00:13:56.340 --> 00:13:58.020
by European scholars,

00:13:58.020 --> 00:14:01.520
as he traveled throughout
the Middle East in the land

00:14:01.520 --> 00:14:03.840
of Israel and in
Syria and in Egypt.

00:14:03.840 --> 00:14:06.940
And wherever he went in what
was then the Ottoman Empire.

00:14:06.940 --> 00:14:09.120
And he brought back
these great treasures.

00:14:09.120 --> 00:14:12.620
The most famous treasure he
brought back is the so-called

00:14:12.620 --> 00:14:15.880
Leningrad Codex, the
oldest complete copy

00:14:15.880 --> 00:14:18.200
of the Bible that we possess.

00:14:18.200 --> 00:14:21.950
With a colophon, a inscription
that, giving us information

00:14:21.950 --> 00:14:23.820
about the scribe and the year.

00:14:23.820 --> 00:14:29.240
Written in the year 1009 CE in
Tiberias in the land of Israel.

00:14:29.240 --> 00:14:30.730
And he brought that
back to Russia

00:14:30.730 --> 00:14:33.100
and it is now in St. Petersburg.

00:14:33.100 --> 00:14:36.140
When it was published
during the 1920s, the city,

00:14:36.140 --> 00:14:37.780
of course, was called Leningrad.

00:14:37.780 --> 00:14:40.470
So, people call it
the Leningrad Codex.

00:14:40.470 --> 00:14:43.470
I think we should start
calling it St. Petersburg Codex

00:14:43.470 --> 00:14:46.840
because the city has
reverted to that name.

00:14:46.840 --> 00:14:48.950
And of course, I do think
there's some irony in the fact

00:14:48.950 --> 00:14:51.410
that years from now, centuries
from now, or millennium

00:14:51.410 --> 00:14:53.330
from now, everybody
will have forgotten

00:14:53.330 --> 00:14:55.050
who Vladimir Lenin was.

00:14:55.050 --> 00:14:56.910
And his name will live
on only in the name

00:14:56.910 --> 00:14:58.210
of the Leningrad Codex.

00:14:58.210 --> 00:14:59.510
How's that for an irony?

00:14:59.510 --> 00:15:01.440
Of course, my students have
already forgotten who Lenin was.

00:15:01.440 --> 00:15:02.850
They think maybe was
one of the Beatles,

00:15:02.850 --> 00:15:05.400
but they don't even know
anything about that.

00:15:05.400 --> 00:15:08.610
Okay. So, Firkovich brings
the Leningrad Codex back

00:15:08.610 --> 00:15:10.850
and it is deposited
in the Imperial,

00:15:10.850 --> 00:15:13.220
what was then the Imperial
Library in St. Petersburg,

00:15:13.220 --> 00:15:15.280
where resides to
the present day.

00:15:15.280 --> 00:15:18.520
And presumably, he is the one
who must have brought the scroll

00:15:18.520 --> 00:15:22.110
that we have here at the Library
of Congress, scroll sheet back.

00:15:22.110 --> 00:15:23.750
We don't know that for sure,

00:15:23.750 --> 00:15:26.780
but his fingerprints,
quotation mark.

00:15:26.780 --> 00:15:30.060
Right. His fingerprints are all
over such a document that came

00:15:30.060 --> 00:15:34.970
from the Middle East
to Russia by a Karaite,

00:15:34.970 --> 00:15:36.270
into the Karaite community.

00:15:36.270 --> 00:15:39.550
And then, given to the royal
family, as I indicated.

00:15:39.550 --> 00:15:45.150
And then, presumably, somebody
got it out of the Russia,

00:15:45.150 --> 00:15:47.230
folded it up, smuggled it out.

00:15:47.230 --> 00:15:51.160
We don't know, and just
winds up, hence, the fold.

00:15:51.160 --> 00:15:52.960
And it just winds up
in London and it's

00:15:52.960 --> 00:15:56.030
on the auction market
in the year 2001.

00:15:56.030 --> 00:15:59.460
That's as much as we can say
about this, about the history

00:15:59.460 --> 00:16:02.650
of this, of this document.

00:16:02.650 --> 00:16:04.360
Now, as I mentioned before.

00:16:04.360 --> 00:16:06.280
Oh, and it was on
display, as I said,

00:16:06.280 --> 00:16:10.110
right next to the Gutenberg
Bible in the Great Hall.

00:16:10.110 --> 00:16:12.130
And so, I've tried to
recreate a little bit of that

00:16:12.130 --> 00:16:14.510
for you right here, with
the image of the Great Hall,

00:16:14.510 --> 00:16:18.990
of the scroll sheet, and the
Library's Gutenberg Bible.

00:16:18.990 --> 00:16:24.300
So, and I know it was visited
by many people while was

00:16:24.300 --> 00:16:26.490
on display, just not too far

00:16:26.490 --> 00:16:28.990
from where we are
seated, right now.

00:16:28.990 --> 00:16:32.690
And therefore, we can
say based on, although,

00:16:32.690 --> 00:16:35.630
I will demonstrate this in the
second part of my talk, still.

00:16:35.630 --> 00:16:37.580
That this is, to repeat,

00:16:37.580 --> 00:16:42.660
the oldest complete Torah scroll
sheet legible by the naked eye.

00:16:42.660 --> 00:16:44.970
As we'll see in the second half,

00:16:44.970 --> 00:16:48.800
there are other Torah scroll
sheets that are incomplete,

00:16:48.800 --> 00:16:51.060
that are torn, that we can read.

00:16:51.060 --> 00:16:52.700
Or maybe they are complete

00:16:52.700 --> 00:16:55.060
but we can't read them,
they are so black.

00:16:55.060 --> 00:16:57.350
So, this gains the title

00:16:57.350 --> 00:17:00.130
of the oldest complete
Torah scroll sheet legible

00:17:00.130 --> 00:17:01.430
by the naked eye.

00:17:01.430 --> 00:17:03.980
Now, you can't see it on these
images, but on the far left

00:17:03.980 --> 00:17:07.580
and on the far right are
the remains of thread.

00:17:07.580 --> 00:17:11.740
So, remember that a Torah scroll
sheet, this is five columns,

00:17:11.740 --> 00:17:15.870
is written on a single
sheet of parchment.

00:17:15.870 --> 00:17:20.180
And then, they are sewn together
to create the large scroll

00:17:20.180 --> 00:17:22.270
with a large rolled text.

00:17:22.270 --> 00:17:26.130
So, this would have been
a single sheet connected

00:17:26.130 --> 00:17:29.620
to Genesis and the beginning
of Exodus on the one end.

00:17:29.620 --> 00:17:31.780
The rest of Exodus and
all of Leviticus, Numbers,

00:17:31.780 --> 00:17:35.360
and Deuteronomy, the five books
of the Torah on the other end.

00:17:35.360 --> 00:17:36.660
What happened to the rest?

00:17:36.660 --> 00:17:39.070
Why was the single
sheet preserved?

00:17:39.070 --> 00:17:41.600
Right. These are the
things we simply don't know.

00:17:41.600 --> 00:17:45.350
But I think because of the
special nature of Exodus 15,

00:17:45.350 --> 00:17:47.910
which we'll talk about
just a moment the poem

00:17:47.910 --> 00:17:50.840
that you see here, that this
would have been the most

00:17:50.840 --> 00:17:56.050
treasured part of the
of the Torah text.

00:17:56.050 --> 00:17:59.130
Now, here is Exodus
15, as we just said.

00:17:59.130 --> 00:18:01.210
And with that, we have an
interlude and I'm going

00:18:01.210 --> 00:18:04.520
to invite Joseph Englesberg
up here to join me,

00:18:04.520 --> 00:18:06.230
because we're going
to do a little bit

00:18:06.230 --> 00:18:10.010
of a dramatic presentation
for you.

00:18:10.010 --> 00:18:12.000
[ Inaudible Comment ]

00:18:21.790 --> 00:18:25.870
So, for those of you who do
not know the text of Exodus 15,

00:18:25.870 --> 00:18:30.420
we'll give you just a
little bit of it in English

00:18:30.420 --> 00:18:32.810
and just a few lines in Hebrew.

00:18:32.810 --> 00:18:37.410
And so, this is the story of the
crossing of the Sea of Reeds,

00:18:37.410 --> 00:18:41.720
where the Israelites have left
Egypt in Exodus chapter 12.

00:18:41.720 --> 00:18:44.990
And a few chapters
later, chapters 14 and 15,

00:18:44.990 --> 00:18:51.910
Pharaoh's had a change of
heart and he sends the army

00:18:51.910 --> 00:18:58.850
out to track down the
Israelites in the wilderness.

00:18:58.850 --> 00:19:06.370
And they are trapped with
the Egyptian army behind them

00:19:06.370 --> 00:19:08.440
and the sea in front of them.

00:19:08.440 --> 00:19:12.020
And you all know the story.

00:19:12.020 --> 00:19:16.940
The sea split and the Israelites
passed through and the Egyptians

00:19:16.940 --> 00:19:20.360
in pursuit, the sea
comes back together

00:19:20.360 --> 00:19:22.470
and drowns the Egyptians.

00:19:22.470 --> 00:19:27.390
Safely on the other
side of the sea,

00:19:27.390 --> 00:19:29.400
the Israelites sing this text.

00:19:29.400 --> 00:19:37.440
And it is, according to those
of us who work on the history

00:19:37.440 --> 00:19:40.260
of the Hebrew language and
Biblical texts and dating them,

00:19:40.260 --> 00:19:45.560
it is, probably, the
oldest Hebrew composition

00:19:45.560 --> 00:19:47.180
that we possess.

00:19:47.180 --> 00:19:48.940
Exodus Chapter 15,
the Song of the Sea.

00:19:48.940 --> 00:19:50.240
And it goes like this.

00:19:50.240 --> 00:19:51.540
&gt;&gt; Joseph Englesberg:
I will sing to the Lord

00:19:51.540 --> 00:19:52.840
for He has triumphed
gloriously; the horse

00:19:52.840 --> 00:19:54.140
and its rider he has
thrown into the sea.

00:19:54.140 --> 00:19:55.440
&gt;&gt; Gary Rendsburg: The Lord
is my strength and my song

00:19:55.440 --> 00:19:56.740
and he has become my salvation.

00:19:56.740 --> 00:19:58.040
This is my God, and
I will praise Him;

00:19:58.040 --> 00:19:59.340
the God of my father
and I will exalt Him.

00:19:59.340 --> 00:20:00.640
&gt;&gt; Joseph Englesberg:
The Lord is a man

00:20:00.640 --> 00:20:01.940
of war; the Lord is his name.

00:20:01.940 --> 00:20:03.240
&gt;&gt; Gary Rendsburg: Pharaoh's
chariots and his host he cast

00:20:03.240 --> 00:20:04.540
into the sea and his
choice officers are sunk

00:20:04.540 --> 00:20:05.840
in the Sea of Reeds.

00:20:05.840 --> 00:20:07.140
&gt;&gt; Joseph Englesberg:
The floods cover them.

00:20:07.140 --> 00:20:08.440
They went down to the
depths like a stone.

00:20:08.440 --> 00:20:09.740
&gt;&gt; Gary Rendsburg: Your
right hand, oh Lord,

00:20:09.740 --> 00:20:11.040
glorious in power;
your right hand,

00:20:11.040 --> 00:20:12.340
oh Lord, shatters the enemy.

00:20:12.340 --> 00:20:13.640
&gt;&gt; Joseph Englesberg:
In the greatness

00:20:13.640 --> 00:20:14.940
of your majesty you
overthrow your adversaries.

00:20:14.940 --> 00:20:16.240
You sent forth your fury; it
consumes them like stubble.

00:20:16.240 --> 00:20:17.540
&gt;&gt; Gary Rendsburg: At the blast

00:20:17.540 --> 00:20:18.840
of your nostrils the waters
piled up, the flood stood

00:20:18.840 --> 00:20:20.310
up in a heap, the
deeps congealed

00:20:20.310 --> 00:20:22.210
in the heart of the sea.

00:20:22.210 --> 00:20:24.150
&gt;&gt; Joseph Englesberg: The
enemy said, I will pursue.

00:20:24.150 --> 00:20:25.450
&gt;&gt; Gary Rendsburg:
I will overtake.

00:20:25.450 --> 00:20:26.960
&gt;&gt; Joseph Englesberg: I
will divide the spoil.

00:20:26.960 --> 00:20:29.190
&gt;&gt; Gary Rendsburg: My desire
shall have its fill of them.

00:20:29.190 --> 00:20:30.670
&gt;&gt; Joseph Englesberg:
I will draw my sword.

00:20:30.670 --> 00:20:37.510
&gt;&gt; Gary Rendsburg: My
hand shall destroy them.

00:20:37.510 --> 00:20:38.810
&gt;&gt; Joseph Englesberg: You blew

00:20:38.810 --> 00:20:40.390
with your wind, he
sea covered them.

00:20:40.390 --> 00:20:44.510
; they sank as lead
in the might waters.

[ Foreign Language
Spoken By Gary Rendsburg ]

00:20:50.810 --> 00:20:52.110
&gt;&gt; Joseph Englesberg:
Who is like you,

00:20:52.110 --> 00:20:53.410
oh Lord, among the gods?

00:20:53.410 --> 00:20:56.260
Who is like you,
majestic in holiness,

00:20:56.260 --> 00:20:59.650
awesome in glorious
deeds, doing wonders?

00:20:59.650 --> 00:21:01.420
&gt;&gt; Gary Rendsburg: And then
we're skipping the second half

00:21:01.420 --> 00:21:02.720
of the poem.

00:21:02.720 --> 00:21:04.020
We've read the first half of it.

00:21:04.020 --> 00:21:06.170
Until we get to the final line.

00:21:06.170 --> 00:21:08.320
[ Foreign Language ]

00:21:08.320 --> 00:21:11.120
&gt;&gt; Joseph Englesberg: The Lord
shall reign forever and ever.

00:21:11.120 --> 00:21:13.610
&gt;&gt; Gary Rendsburg: And at this
point the text returns to prose.

00:21:13.610 --> 00:21:17.260
The last two lines of the text
that you see here, on the image,

00:21:17.260 --> 00:21:18.920
return to the block prose.

00:21:18.920 --> 00:21:21.200
And we get these little,
you know, few more verses

00:21:21.200 --> 00:21:22.640
about what's happening.

00:21:22.640 --> 00:21:25.330
And then, in a remarkable stroke

00:21:25.330 --> 00:21:29.320
of early iron age
egalitarianism,

00:21:29.320 --> 00:21:31.370
the Hebrew text is
voiced through the women

00:21:31.370 --> 00:21:33.580
who were with the Israelites.

00:21:33.580 --> 00:21:36.770
And with that, we ask Rachel
Becker, of the Library staff,

00:21:36.770 --> 00:21:43.410
the Hebraic Division, to join
us to play the female role

00:21:43.410 --> 00:21:47.080
because the text
then says in prose,

00:21:47.080 --> 00:21:49.730
then Miriam, Miriam, not Miriam.

00:21:49.730 --> 00:21:51.900
Dressed appropriately.

00:21:51.900 --> 00:21:55.290
Then, Miriam the Prophetess, the
sister of Aaron, took a timbrel

00:21:55.290 --> 00:21:58.610
in her hand and all of the
women went out after her

00:21:58.610 --> 00:21:59.910
with timbrels and dancing.

00:21:59.910 --> 00:22:01.710
And Miriam sang to them.

00:22:01.710 --> 00:22:03.010
&gt;&gt; Rachel Becker:
Sing to the Lord,

00:22:03.010 --> 00:22:05.260
for He has triumphed gloriously!

00:22:05.260 --> 00:22:07.930
The horse and its rider he
has thrown into the sea!

00:22:07.930 --> 00:22:09.730
&gt;&gt; Gary Rendsburg:
Isn't that beautiful?

00:22:09.730 --> 00:22:14.500
[ Applause ]

00:22:17.780 --> 00:22:19.210
Thank you, Joseph.

00:22:19.210 --> 00:22:21.170
Thank you, I almost
called you Miriam.

00:22:21.170 --> 00:22:22.470
Thank you, Rachel.

00:22:22.470 --> 00:22:23.770
You're so good.

00:22:23.770 --> 00:22:25.730
Now. Okay.

00:22:25.730 --> 00:22:31.910
Well, we'll do it from here.

00:22:31.910 --> 00:22:36.370
I just wanted to point
out a few features

00:22:36.370 --> 00:22:38.390
of this scroll beyond
the poetry.

00:22:38.390 --> 00:22:45.650
Those of you who know Torah
scrolls, this predates some

00:22:45.650 --> 00:22:47.210
of the features of
the Torah scroll

00:22:47.210 --> 00:22:48.510
that you would be familiar with.

00:22:48.510 --> 00:22:52.020
First of all, there is
no left justification.

00:22:52.020 --> 00:22:54.380
Let's remember that Hebrew is
written from right to left.

00:22:54.380 --> 00:22:57.460
So, the columns begin
right justified.

00:22:57.460 --> 00:23:00.320
But there is no attempt to
do any left justification.

00:23:00.320 --> 00:23:01.700
Some lines are slightly shorter.

00:23:01.700 --> 00:23:03.200
Some lines are slightly longer.

00:23:03.200 --> 00:23:04.860
Can everybody see that, right?

00:23:04.860 --> 00:23:08.170
Today in the Middle Ages, the,
the tradition of doing right

00:23:08.170 --> 00:23:10.730
and left justification
developed.

00:23:10.730 --> 00:23:12.780
And so, this predates that.

00:23:12.780 --> 00:23:16.290
How did scribes the Middle Ages
do right and left justification?

00:23:16.290 --> 00:23:17.590
What if the long, what

00:23:17.590 --> 00:23:19.670
if the word was just
too long or too short?

00:23:19.670 --> 00:23:20.970
What they do?

00:23:20.970 --> 00:23:23.420
Right. They created what
we call dilated letters.

00:23:23.420 --> 00:23:26.970
They would take certain Hebrew
letters like the final Mem

00:23:26.970 --> 00:23:28.850
and stretch it out a little bit.

00:23:28.850 --> 00:23:30.880
Right. So, they would make,
they would get that right

00:23:30.880 --> 00:23:32.650
and left justification.

00:23:32.650 --> 00:23:35.790
You don't see that here.

00:23:35.790 --> 00:23:38.550
Seven letters of
the Hebrew alphabet

00:23:38.550 --> 00:23:41.850
in Torah scrolls have
little crowns on them.

00:23:41.850 --> 00:23:45.220
Little tittles on tops of
the letters, which we call

00:23:45.220 --> 00:23:48.190
in Hebrew, ''Tagin'',
meaning crowns.

00:23:48.190 --> 00:23:50.440
And these, this scroll
has none of that.

00:23:50.440 --> 00:23:53.350
Right. This doesn't, this
doesn't, this is not part

00:23:53.350 --> 00:23:56.190
of this tradition, yet.

00:23:56.190 --> 00:23:59.570
The last and the third feature,
which you do, which you see

00:23:59.570 --> 00:24:03.400
on medieval and contemporary
scrolls but you don't see here.

00:24:03.400 --> 00:24:08.680
There is a tradition to begin
each column with the letter Vav.

00:24:08.680 --> 00:24:11.910
The commonest letter in the
Hebrew alphabet is the word Vav,

00:24:11.910 --> 00:24:14.590
the letter Vav, which
means the word and.

00:24:14.590 --> 00:24:17.120
And it is so ubiquitous that
you could actually space

00:24:17.120 --> 00:24:20.100
out a Torah scroll and have
every single column begin

00:24:20.100 --> 00:24:21.400
with that letter Vav.

00:24:21.400 --> 00:24:23.090
What is known in the Hebrew
tradition is [foreign language],

00:24:23.090 --> 00:24:25.950
the Vavs of the columns.

00:24:25.950 --> 00:24:27.950
That is not present
here, either.

00:24:27.950 --> 00:24:31.400
So, no left justification,
no tagin, the little tittles,

00:24:31.400 --> 00:24:34.650
and no attempt to lay out the
text so that the letter Vav is

00:24:34.650 --> 00:24:36.160
at the beginning of each column.

00:24:36.160 --> 00:24:38.160
That is not to be
found here, at all.

00:24:38.160 --> 00:24:40.570
And of course, that
helps us understand

00:24:40.570 --> 00:24:44.010
that this is a very
ancient scroll,

00:24:44.010 --> 00:24:48.430
unlike all other,
all other scrolls.

00:24:48.430 --> 00:24:51.220
Also, and it's almost
impossible to see on this image,

00:24:51.220 --> 00:24:53.410
there are occasional
corrections.

00:24:53.410 --> 00:24:56.330
Now, according to Jewish law
and, certainly, as practiced

00:24:56.330 --> 00:24:59.860
by later scribes from, let's
say, the 13th century onward,

00:24:59.860 --> 00:25:01.430
if you make a mistake you have

00:25:01.430 --> 00:25:04.870
to scrape it off
or just restart.

00:25:04.870 --> 00:25:06.790
Or just, you know, can't use it

00:25:06.790 --> 00:25:09.160
for liturgical purposes
in the synagogue.

00:25:09.160 --> 00:25:13.000
This apparently either
ignores that or it's too early

00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:17.030
to be participating in that
legal tradition or custom.

00:25:17.030 --> 00:25:21.300
And therefore, you do see
occasional corrections here.

00:25:21.300 --> 00:25:24.550
Some of them by, one of them
in particular, adds a word.

00:25:24.550 --> 00:25:28.410
I don't think you can
see it, but right up here

00:25:28.410 --> 00:25:32.500
between the lines, I mean,
I can't see it myself,

00:25:32.500 --> 00:25:33.800
either, at the moment.

00:25:33.800 --> 00:25:38.690
There is a, the Hebrew word
Et, which doesn't have, really,

00:25:38.690 --> 00:25:42.020
any meaning, but
note, it informs you

00:25:42.020 --> 00:25:44.540
that the direct object
is to follow,

00:25:44.540 --> 00:25:46.360
is inserted between
the two lines.

00:25:46.360 --> 00:25:48.320
Because the scribe had
left it out and went back

00:25:48.320 --> 00:25:49.700
and made that correction.

00:25:49.700 --> 00:25:51.400
And there's occasional
other corrections.

00:25:51.400 --> 00:25:55.700
One in particular, down here
and be, towards the bottom

00:25:55.700 --> 00:26:00.100
of the third column, where they
change the paragraphing system.

00:26:00.100 --> 00:26:02.720
You can see white spaces which
are indicating paragraphs.

00:26:02.720 --> 00:26:04.380
So, that was changed, as well.

00:26:04.380 --> 00:26:07.200
I do, I should point out that
the only place you see the left

00:26:07.200 --> 00:26:10.140
justification is in
the five prose lines

00:26:10.140 --> 00:26:12.190
in the upper left
before the song,

00:26:12.190 --> 00:26:15.310
and the five immediate
lines below the song.

00:26:15.310 --> 00:26:17.530
Right. Before the, above
and below the poem.

00:26:17.530 --> 00:26:22.050
There, you can actually see the
left justification, as well.

00:26:22.050 --> 00:26:23.880
Okay. Now, how do we know

00:26:23.880 --> 00:26:27.630
that this is really the oldest
complete Torah scroll sheet

00:26:27.630 --> 00:26:29.560
legible to the naked eye?

00:26:29.560 --> 00:26:30.860
Let's take a tour of that

00:26:30.860 --> 00:26:33.380
in the second half
of this presentation.

00:26:33.380 --> 00:26:37.160
So, the Ein Gedi Synagogue on
the shore of the Dead Sea dates

00:26:37.160 --> 00:26:39.800
to the fifth to the
seventh century.

00:26:39.800 --> 00:26:43.060
It was excavated in the 1970s.

00:26:43.060 --> 00:26:45.090
Here is a photo of the
way it looks, today.

00:26:45.090 --> 00:26:46.390
It's outdoors.

00:26:46.390 --> 00:26:47.690
You just see the foundation.

00:26:47.690 --> 00:26:49.070
How many of you have
been to Ein Gedi?

00:26:49.070 --> 00:26:52.340
Anybody? Worth a stop at
this beautiful synagogue

00:26:52.340 --> 00:26:53.640
with a mosaic floor.

00:26:53.640 --> 00:26:56.270
There's a tent over
it now, to protect it.

00:26:56.270 --> 00:27:02.840
And this is the area, this is
the area of the Torah scroll arc

00:27:02.840 --> 00:27:05.850
where the, would have been
a wooden box of some sort

00:27:05.850 --> 00:27:07.400
where the Torah scrolls
would have been kept.

00:27:07.400 --> 00:27:10.310
The Torah scroll
niche, the Torah niche.

00:27:10.310 --> 00:27:14.350
And in the excavations in
1970 this was found there.

00:27:14.350 --> 00:27:16.330
A burnt scroll.

00:27:16.330 --> 00:27:19.160
And it is charred,
it is impossible,

00:27:19.160 --> 00:27:20.780
must been an accidental fire.

00:27:20.780 --> 00:27:22.830
It is impossible to open up.

00:27:22.830 --> 00:27:25.610
The archaeologists just kept it.

00:27:25.610 --> 00:27:26.910
Right. They just kept it

00:27:26.910 --> 00:27:31.360
for 45 years thinking one
day technology will catch up.

00:27:31.360 --> 00:27:35.540
And it did, because we
now can do CT scanning,

00:27:35.540 --> 00:27:38.470
which you probably think was
invented for medical purposes

00:27:38.470 --> 00:27:40.880
but was really invented
to read old Torah scrolls.

00:27:40.880 --> 00:27:46.600
And here it is with the
Bruker Skyscan model 1176.

00:27:46.600 --> 00:27:48.900
Right. We have the 1076 at home.

00:27:48.900 --> 00:27:51.300
That's why we couldn't do
it ourselves, but we figured

00:27:51.300 --> 00:27:52.890
out how to do it with somebody.

00:27:52.890 --> 00:27:54.530
And they did the scroll.

00:27:54.530 --> 00:27:59.700
And here is, of course, it would
be black ink on white parchment,

00:27:59.700 --> 00:28:02.760
but you all know because
x-rays know these other kinds

00:28:02.760 --> 00:28:04.240
of MRIs and CT scans.

00:28:04.240 --> 00:28:05.970
It's always inverted imaging.

00:28:05.970 --> 00:28:08.130
And so, here is the
white letters.

00:28:08.130 --> 00:28:10.950
And turns out to be the
beginning of the book Leviticus.

00:28:10.950 --> 00:28:13.050
This was done in 2015.

00:28:13.050 --> 00:28:16.570
Next year, the scientists
went deeper into the scroll

00:28:16.570 --> 00:28:20.430
and this is still not been,
this is digitally unrolled.

00:28:20.430 --> 00:28:21.730
Do you realize what we're
talking about, here?

00:28:21.730 --> 00:28:24.080
Right. Digitally unwrapped,
digitally unrolled.

00:28:24.080 --> 00:28:27.050
And here is now the
complete scan

00:28:27.050 --> 00:28:30.790
of the scroll beginning
Exodus chapters one and two.

00:28:30.790 --> 00:28:34.740
You'll notice that there
is a blank sheet right

00:28:34.740 --> 00:28:36.850
in front of it, here.

00:28:36.850 --> 00:28:41.590
Okay. That tells us that this
scroll was not a complete scroll

00:28:41.590 --> 00:28:43.950
of Torah, but only the
book of Leviticus, right.

00:28:43.950 --> 00:28:45.250
Because, otherwise,
you'd see the end

00:28:45.250 --> 00:28:47.240
of Exodus before the
beginning of Leviticus.

00:28:47.240 --> 00:28:49.920
That it was just
Leviticus or, maybe,

00:28:49.920 --> 00:28:51.730
the second half of the Torah.

00:28:51.730 --> 00:28:54.060
Maybe, they used Genesis
and Exodus in one scroll,

00:28:54.060 --> 00:28:56.320
and then Leviticus, Numbers,
Deuteronomy in another.

00:28:56.320 --> 00:28:58.400
But this tells us this is
the beginning of the scroll

00:28:58.400 --> 00:29:00.830
and it starts with Leviticus.

00:29:00.830 --> 00:29:04.280
By the way, what do we call that
blank sheet at the beginning?

00:29:04.280 --> 00:29:06.150
A protocol.

00:29:06.150 --> 00:29:08.350
Protocol in Greek means
''that which was glued

00:29:08.350 --> 00:29:10.090
to the beginning of a scroll''.

00:29:10.090 --> 00:29:14.590
And in the Greek manuscripts or,
even in other later manuscripts,

00:29:14.590 --> 00:29:16.860
they would give you notations
as to what's in the scroll.

00:29:16.860 --> 00:29:18.510
So, you would just
have to open up.

00:29:18.510 --> 00:29:20.150
That was the protocol.

00:29:20.150 --> 00:29:22.970
Okay. The Jews didn't do that.

00:29:22.970 --> 00:29:25.690
They just put a blank sheet
there and didn't write on it

00:29:25.690 --> 00:29:28.330
because you just opened up
and saw it was Leviticus.

00:29:28.330 --> 00:29:31.240
And yes, there's a Lincoln penny
there because the scientists

00:29:31.240 --> 00:29:33.390
who did the work were at
the University of Kentucky.

00:29:33.390 --> 00:29:36.150
And so, this is there homage to
their most famous native son.

00:29:36.150 --> 00:29:42.270
At the Weitzman Institute
in Israel, it was subjected

00:29:42.270 --> 00:29:44.580
with a small piece
to a carbon-14 test

00:29:44.580 --> 00:29:47.020
and dated to around 300 CE.

00:29:47.020 --> 00:29:50.750
And since the synagogue is from
the sixth or seventh centuries,

00:29:50.750 --> 00:29:52.530
this informs us that
a scroll was in use

00:29:52.530 --> 00:29:53.830
for several centuries.

00:29:53.830 --> 00:29:56.580
Three-four centuries
inside the synagogue

00:29:56.580 --> 00:29:59.110
for liturgical purposes.

00:29:59.110 --> 00:30:01.090
And here it is, digitally
unwrapped now,

00:30:01.090 --> 00:30:02.390
with the black on white.

00:30:02.390 --> 00:30:04.890
Why we can play with the images.

00:30:04.890 --> 00:30:07.160
Thank you, scholars
and scientists,

00:30:07.160 --> 00:30:09.300
who help us out with
all of this work.

00:30:09.300 --> 00:30:13.490
This one is, actually,
in the US.

00:30:13.490 --> 00:30:16.350
This is known as
Ashkar-Gilson number two.

00:30:16.350 --> 00:30:19.510
It's in the David M.
Rubenstein Rare Book

00:30:19.510 --> 00:30:21.570
and Manuscript Library
at Duke University.

00:30:21.570 --> 00:30:24.220
And I mentioned his name because
he has been a great benefactor

00:30:24.220 --> 00:30:26.540
of book culture and is
a member of the Library

00:30:26.540 --> 00:30:29.370
of Congress Board,
if I'm not mistaken.

00:30:29.370 --> 00:30:34.400
So, he is a major player
in preserving books

00:30:34.400 --> 00:30:38.340
and manuscripts from
centuries ago.

00:30:38.340 --> 00:30:40.850
This is already digitally
enhanced.

00:30:40.850 --> 00:30:42.840
You can almost read
nothing of this.

00:30:42.840 --> 00:30:45.760
It so happens to,
also, be Exodus 15.

00:30:45.760 --> 00:30:49.750
And you can see the scroll,
the layout of the poem

00:30:49.750 --> 00:30:51.550
that we just read
and that we just saw

00:30:51.550 --> 00:30:54.010
on our scroll sheet,
you can see it here.

00:30:54.010 --> 00:30:56.240
But A, it's not complete, and B,

00:30:56.240 --> 00:30:58.440
it's almost impossible
to read anything.

00:30:58.440 --> 00:31:00.150
I've been to the Duke library.

00:31:00.150 --> 00:31:03.300
I've seen this with my own eyes
and, trust me, there's not much

00:31:03.300 --> 00:31:06.080
that one can actually
read by looking at it,

00:31:06.080 --> 00:31:09.780
unless you have some digital
enhancement as you see here.

00:31:09.780 --> 00:31:12.580
Here it is much more legible

00:31:12.580 --> 00:31:15.450
with some more photo
enhancement.

00:31:15.450 --> 00:31:18.600
Dated to around 700 CE.

00:31:18.600 --> 00:31:22.470
And there's an up
close, really beautiful.

00:31:22.470 --> 00:31:25.270
There is this scroll,
which was in London.

00:31:25.270 --> 00:31:27.440
How I got to London,
we don't know.

00:31:27.440 --> 00:31:32.590
It was in London for up until
the 20th century, and maybe even

00:31:32.590 --> 00:31:35.000
into the 21st century,
at Jews' College,

00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:37.930
a training ground
for rabbis in the UK.

00:31:37.930 --> 00:31:40.950
And it's a complete sheet,

00:31:40.950 --> 00:31:44.630
as you can see here,
of seven columns.

00:31:44.630 --> 00:31:48.720
And it includes a large chunk
of the book of Exodus leading

00:31:48.720 --> 00:31:52.630
up to the material that we
just saw on the previous one.

00:31:52.630 --> 00:31:55.630
Now, this, also, cannot be
read with the naked eye.

00:31:55.630 --> 00:32:01.620
And it's now, also, in the
private hands of a collector.

00:32:01.620 --> 00:32:04.010
It has recently been
determined that these, actually,

00:32:04.010 --> 00:32:05.850
come from the same sheet.

00:32:05.850 --> 00:32:09.910
In other words, the paleography
experts who worked on this,

00:32:09.910 --> 00:32:13.310
the handwriting experts,
which we call paleographers.

00:32:13.310 --> 00:32:16.760
Now, tell us that the
London scroll on the right,

00:32:16.760 --> 00:32:18.200
which is now in private hands,

00:32:18.200 --> 00:32:22.120
and the Ashkar-Gilson
scroll fragment at Duke,

00:32:22.120 --> 00:32:26.710
come from the same scroll with
a column in between missing.

00:32:26.710 --> 00:32:29.990
And this was recently
worked out by Edna Engel

00:32:29.990 --> 00:32:33.720
and Mordechay Mishor
in Jerusalem.

00:32:35.030 --> 00:32:39.500
Ashkar-Gilson collection
has another scroll fragment.

00:32:39.500 --> 00:32:42.620
Nobody can read anything
on this.

00:32:42.620 --> 00:32:44.660
But, welcome to photography.

00:32:44.660 --> 00:32:48.510
Via multispectral imaging
we can read everything, now.

00:32:48.510 --> 00:32:51.620
And for those you who can
read Hebrew, this is a version

00:32:51.620 --> 00:32:55.140
of the Ten Commandments in the
book of Deuteronomy chapter 5.

00:32:55.140 --> 00:32:59.830
Isn't it great to live
in the 21st century

00:32:59.830 --> 00:33:02.450
where we can do all this?

00:33:02.450 --> 00:33:04.840
Here are some scroll sheets
that are, also, very old

00:33:04.840 --> 00:33:06.690
and are legible to
the naked eye.

00:33:06.690 --> 00:33:09.250
They all come from
the Cairo Genizah,

00:33:09.250 --> 00:33:11.390
Cambridge University
Library collection.

00:33:11.390 --> 00:33:13.780
TS stands for Taylor-Schechter.

00:33:13.780 --> 00:33:17.910
This one is dated to around 800
CE by the paleography experts.

00:33:17.910 --> 00:33:20.450
It's from Genesis, but
again, not complete.

00:33:20.450 --> 00:33:24.640
How do we know it's a Torah
scroll and not something else?

00:33:24.640 --> 00:33:26.530
Because the back is blank.

00:33:26.530 --> 00:33:29.760
Right. Eventually, the Jews
will move from the Torah scroll

00:33:29.760 --> 00:33:32.820
to the Codex, which is the
forerunner of the modern book,

00:33:32.820 --> 00:33:35.480
where you will have
writing on both sides.

00:33:35.480 --> 00:33:36.780
But all the things I'm talking

00:33:36.780 --> 00:33:39.390
about here are scrolls
and scroll sheets.

00:33:39.390 --> 00:33:42.040
Jews will continue to
use the scroll format

00:33:42.040 --> 00:33:44.480
down to the present
day in the synagogue

00:33:44.480 --> 00:33:47.140
for liturgical purposes of
the reading of the Torah

00:33:47.140 --> 00:33:48.550
and the book of Esther.

00:33:48.550 --> 00:33:50.220
But we can take images.

00:33:50.220 --> 00:33:51.970
We have images of these things

00:33:51.970 --> 00:33:55.850
to show us both the
recto and the verso.

00:33:55.850 --> 00:34:01.770
Here is a close-up of
just one small passage

00:34:01.770 --> 00:34:04.480
from Genesis chapter 14.

00:34:04.480 --> 00:34:05.970
And I've given you
the Hebrew text

00:34:05.970 --> 00:34:09.080
in its later Masoretic
apparatus,

00:34:09.080 --> 00:34:12.560
so you can comparison there.

00:34:12.560 --> 00:34:14.760
This comes from the
same scroll, as well,

00:34:14.760 --> 00:34:16.290
as the paleographers
now tell us.

00:34:16.290 --> 00:34:19.250
Also, in Cambridge, but the
earlier parts of Genesis.

00:34:19.250 --> 00:34:23.070
A small fragment from
around a century later.

00:34:23.070 --> 00:34:24.570
There it is blank.

00:34:24.570 --> 00:34:30.350
From a century later, we
have another fragment.

00:34:30.350 --> 00:34:31.650
See the seam?

00:34:31.650 --> 00:34:33.350
So, you can see how these
would have been two sheets

00:34:33.350 --> 00:34:34.860
that were sewn together.

00:34:34.860 --> 00:34:37.170
These are all in
Cambridge, originally found

00:34:37.170 --> 00:34:41.480
in the Cairo synagogue, the
Cairo Genizah collection.

00:34:41.480 --> 00:34:44.640
Blank on the reverse.

00:34:44.640 --> 00:34:49.100
One of the best examples of
what can happen in the history

00:34:49.100 --> 00:34:51.050
of manuscripts is this.

00:34:51.050 --> 00:34:53.370
Does everybody see what this is?

00:34:55.810 --> 00:34:58.080
Well, you can't come to a
Library of Congress talk

00:34:58.080 --> 00:35:00.910
in this division and not
hear the word palimpsest.

00:35:00.910 --> 00:35:02.950
This is a palimpsest.

00:35:02.950 --> 00:35:07.260
Right. It is an old
Hebrew manuscript

00:35:07.260 --> 00:35:09.840
where the ink was scraped off,

00:35:09.840 --> 00:35:14.370
and then a later scribe
wrote Greek on top of it.

00:35:14.370 --> 00:35:17.550
That, we call palimpsest,
where things were scraped off.

00:35:17.550 --> 00:35:19.830
This is from the used
parchment market.

00:35:19.830 --> 00:35:24.190
And we have so many palimpsests
from the early Middle Ages

00:35:24.190 --> 00:35:26.220
because it was hard
to get parchment.

00:35:26.220 --> 00:35:28.350
It was a lot of work
to get parchment.

00:35:28.350 --> 00:35:30.920
And so, you would have
to constantly rework it

00:35:30.920 --> 00:35:33.060
and scrape it and if
you did need it anymore.

00:35:33.060 --> 00:35:36.460
We don't know how this Hebrew
text was no longer being used.

00:35:36.460 --> 00:35:40.430
But it's a Torah scroll
underneath that was, somehow,

00:35:40.430 --> 00:35:45.400
got into Christian hands and a
Greek writing scribe wrote this.

00:35:45.400 --> 00:35:50.250
This is in the Medici
Library in Florence.

00:35:50.250 --> 00:35:55.060
And actually, we now know
from further analysis

00:35:55.060 --> 00:35:58.810
that six different handwritings
are on the under text.

00:35:58.810 --> 00:36:01.350
And it dates from more or less
the same time as the new Library

00:36:01.350 --> 00:36:03.110
of Congress Torah scroll sheet.

00:36:03.110 --> 00:36:05.970
And here we are, again.

00:36:05.970 --> 00:36:10.830
And so, with that
little review we can say,

00:36:10.830 --> 00:36:13.280
as I said a moment
ago, that the Library

00:36:13.280 --> 00:36:15.920
of Congress Torah scroll
sheet is the oldest sheet

00:36:15.920 --> 00:36:18.510
in the world legible
to the naked eye.

00:36:18.510 --> 00:36:20.410
Right. Do we have
all the material?

00:36:20.410 --> 00:36:23.000
Yes. Can we read them?

00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:25.690
Either, they are fragmentary,
so they're not complete.

00:36:25.690 --> 00:36:27.100
Or we can't read them

00:36:27.100 --> 00:36:29.730
and we only need photo
enhancement to read them.

00:36:29.730 --> 00:36:33.300
So, here you have it to repeat
the oldest Torah scroll sheet

00:36:33.300 --> 00:36:37.830
legible to the naked eye, dated
to around 1,000 years ago.

00:36:37.830 --> 00:36:39.340
To conclude, if you're
interested

00:36:39.340 --> 00:36:43.870
where our oldest Torah scrolls
complete are to be found.

00:36:43.870 --> 00:36:46.440
And I've shown you very
fragmentary material.

00:36:46.440 --> 00:36:49.750
The oldest complete Torah
scroll in the world is

00:36:49.750 --> 00:36:53.580
in the University Library
in Bologna, recently dated

00:36:53.580 --> 00:36:58.090
with carbon-14 testing
to the year 1190 CE.

00:36:58.090 --> 00:37:03.100
And if you go back, in
this case, about 800 years,

00:37:03.100 --> 00:37:06.430
the plus minus of carbon-14
dating is really only

00:37:06.430 --> 00:37:08.320
about a 50-year window.

00:37:08.320 --> 00:37:12.450
So, it dates from 1140 to
1240, or something like that.

00:37:12.450 --> 00:37:15.610
In the C-14 test, we
split the difference

00:37:15.610 --> 00:37:17.550
and we come out with 1190.

00:37:17.550 --> 00:37:19.750
And you can see the image
has been opened up again

00:37:19.750 --> 00:37:21.730
to the same text that
we've been looking at,

00:37:21.730 --> 00:37:24.140
the poem of Exodus 15.

00:37:24.140 --> 00:37:26.930
Next time in your
Bologna, go to the library

00:37:26.930 --> 00:37:29.440
and request to see
this treasure.

00:37:29.440 --> 00:37:32.150
That's the oldest complete
Torah scroll we have.

00:37:32.150 --> 00:37:36.470
What about the oldest complete
Torah scroll still in use?

00:37:36.470 --> 00:37:40.730
Not in a university library,
still in a synagogue?

00:37:40.730 --> 00:37:43.430
At the northern Italian
city of Biella,

00:37:43.430 --> 00:37:46.570
where there is a small Jewish
community not far from Milan,

00:37:46.570 --> 00:37:49.090
this Torah scroll
is still in use.

00:37:49.090 --> 00:37:50.530
It's in the synagogue.

00:37:50.530 --> 00:37:53.620
And it, also, was recently
dated by carbon-14.

00:37:53.620 --> 00:37:55.200
You need just a little fleck.

00:37:55.200 --> 00:37:58.110
So, they took a little
fleck of the parchment.

00:37:58.110 --> 00:37:59.800
In the old days you'd
need huge amount,

00:37:59.800 --> 00:38:02.240
but today you can just take
like a fingernail worth.

00:38:02.240 --> 00:38:04.210
And both of these tests
were conducted, by the way,

00:38:04.210 --> 00:38:07.780
at the University of Illinois,
which has the best C-14 lab

00:38:07.780 --> 00:38:10.950
in the U.S. And why they send it
to the U.S. instead of someplace

00:38:10.950 --> 00:38:12.250
in Europe, I don't know.

00:38:12.250 --> 00:38:13.650
But they were both done here.

00:38:13.650 --> 00:38:15.660
And this one is from 1250 CE.

00:38:15.660 --> 00:38:19.470
Again, a plus minus of a
bit in either direction.

00:38:19.470 --> 00:38:23.030
But it gives you a sense of
how old these manuscripts are,

00:38:23.030 --> 00:38:28.290
how old and how well preserved
the ink on the parchment can be.

00:38:28.290 --> 00:38:31.700
Because these were done with
the best quality materials.

00:38:31.700 --> 00:38:34.950
Right. These were sacred
texts, which the scribes

00:38:34.950 --> 00:38:37.190
and the communities who
used them knew would last

00:38:37.190 --> 00:38:38.520
for centuries.

00:38:38.520 --> 00:38:42.390
And they took the best
parchment and the best ink

00:38:42.390 --> 00:38:44.120
and had the best scribal hands.

00:38:44.120 --> 00:38:47.420
And together, produced
these magnificent documents,

00:38:47.420 --> 00:38:50.550
including the one that is now
here at the Library of Congress.

The Dead Sea Scrolls
are our oldest,

00:40:27.610 --> 00:40:31.400
amongst the Dead Sea Scrolls are
our oldest biblical documents.

00:40:31.400 --> 00:40:35.730
Right. So, the Dead Sea Scrolls
date from the third, second,

00:40:35.730 --> 00:40:37.780
and first centuries BCE.

00:40:37.780 --> 00:40:41.240
Found in the 1940s and
1950s in the caves of Qumran

00:40:41.240 --> 00:40:43.140
on the shore of the Dead Sea.

But it is not written
in the poetic style.

00:41:13.580 --> 00:41:16.640
It is written in block as
if were just prose blocking.

00:41:16.640 --> 00:41:20.060
It would have been
read as poetry.

00:41:20.060 --> 00:41:22.450
Right. The oral reading
tradition always would have read

00:41:22.450 --> 00:41:24.610
it in a poetic fashion.

in a graphic form in writing,

of these things with

00:42:24.980 --> 00:42:30.730
Okay. So, the question is about
the use of the Codex and the use

00:42:30.730 --> 00:42:33.400
of the Masoretic material.

00:42:33.400 --> 00:42:37.270
So, Masoretic is the
English word based

00:42:37.270 --> 00:42:40.200
on the Hebrew word Masorah,
which means tradition.

00:42:40.200 --> 00:42:43.390
There were a group of scholars
in the ninth, in the eighth,

00:42:43.390 --> 00:42:46.940
ninth, and tenth centuries,
mainly in Tiberius, Israel,

00:42:46.940 --> 00:42:49.690
but also, other places
including Babylonia.

00:42:49.690 --> 00:42:54.740
Who created a graphic
representation of the vowels,

00:42:54.740 --> 00:42:56.250
the punctuation, and so on.

00:42:56.250 --> 00:42:58.910
For those of you don't know the
Hebrew system that we're looking

00:42:58.910 --> 00:43:02.300
at here, there is nothing
here but the 22 letters

00:43:02.300 --> 00:43:04.800
of the alphabet, which
are all consonants.

00:43:04.800 --> 00:43:06.430
There are no vowels.

00:43:06.430 --> 00:43:09.080
There are word breaks,
space between words.

00:43:09.080 --> 00:43:10.380
But there's no punctuation.

00:43:10.380 --> 00:43:12.210
It doesn't tell you
when a word ends.

00:43:12.210 --> 00:43:14.520
So, this is the graphic
and it's the oldest,

00:43:14.520 --> 00:43:18.060
the way to write the Hebrew
language in graphic form.

00:43:18.060 --> 00:43:20.130
There was an oral reading
tradition, which I alluded

00:43:20.130 --> 00:43:23.850
to a moment ago, where the
tradents, the oral readers,

00:43:23.850 --> 00:43:26.970
knew how to intone a text.

00:43:26.970 --> 00:43:29.170
They knew the vowels,
they knew the accents,

00:43:29.170 --> 00:43:31.800
they knew the punctuation,
and so on.

00:43:31.800 --> 00:43:33.650
Just like you know these
things from memory.

00:43:33.650 --> 00:43:37.390
So, the Masoretes created a
graphic system to represent all

00:43:37.390 --> 00:43:39.190
that in the eighth-ninth
century.

00:43:39.190 --> 00:43:43.130
And at the same time, we have
the Jews adopting the Codex,

00:43:43.130 --> 00:43:45.840
which was prior to that
associated with Christianity.

00:43:45.840 --> 00:43:47.830
As I said, writing
on both sides.

00:43:47.830 --> 00:43:50.440
So, all of that is
happening, you're correct,

00:43:50.440 --> 00:43:51.740
in the eighth and
ninth centuries.

00:43:51.740 --> 00:43:54.890
And the Leningrad Codex, which I
mentioned, is the tenth century.

00:43:54.890 --> 00:43:56.760
The other famous one
is the Aleppo Codex

00:43:56.760 --> 00:43:58.380
from the ninth century.

00:43:58.380 --> 00:44:01.080
And, sorry, the tenth, Aleppo
Codex is tenth century.

00:44:01.080 --> 00:44:03.650
The Leningrad Codex
is early 11th century.

00:44:03.650 --> 00:44:07.170
But it doesn't have an
effect on Torah scroll.

00:44:07.170 --> 00:44:09.630
Because for liturgical purposes,

00:44:09.630 --> 00:44:12.840
religious tradition is the
most conservative aspect

00:44:12.840 --> 00:44:15.000
of any society; Jewish,
Christian, Muslim,

00:44:15.000 --> 00:44:16.390
Hindu, it doesn't matter.

00:44:16.390 --> 00:44:17.930
And so, since the
Jews have been writing

00:44:17.930 --> 00:44:21.740
out Torah scrolls going back
to the Dead Sea Scrolls,

00:44:21.740 --> 00:44:24.910
to the Ein Gedi Synagogue scroll
that I showed you, and so on.

00:44:24.910 --> 00:44:28.440
That was unaffected by
the shift to the Codex,

00:44:28.440 --> 00:44:30.880
as it is down to
the present day.

00:44:30.880 --> 00:44:32.680
Yes. Yeah.

[ Inaudible Comments ]

00:44:50.730 --> 00:44:55.370
Okay. The question is about
the kosher-ness of the scroll,

00:44:55.370 --> 00:44:58.720
whether it's legally or
holotically [phonetic] fit

00:44:58.720 --> 00:45:00.680
for the use in the synagogue.

00:45:00.680 --> 00:45:05.910
And so, as I alluded to, we, our
working assumption is that all

00:45:05.910 --> 00:45:08.320
of these scrolls were
for liturgical purposes.

00:45:08.320 --> 00:45:13.320
Certainly, by this time, study
scrolls, reading scrolls were

00:45:13.320 --> 00:45:15.010
in the form of the Codex,

00:45:15.010 --> 00:45:19.190
which was a great leap
forward for book culture.

00:45:19.190 --> 00:45:22.070
And the, had the
apparatus of vowels

00:45:22.070 --> 00:45:23.750
and punctuation, and so on.

00:45:23.750 --> 00:45:26.430
So, these only have been
used for liturgical purposes.

00:45:26.430 --> 00:45:28.130
There can be no doubt
about that.

00:45:28.130 --> 00:45:29.430

00:46:05.330 --> 00:46:08.350
Yeah. The Encyclopedia
Judaica would have a entry.

00:46:08.350 --> 00:46:11.620
And the old Jewish
Encyclopedia of 1906, probably,

00:46:11.620 --> 00:46:13.380
has a good entry, as well.

00:46:13.380 --> 00:46:15.570
And that's available
free and online.

00:46:15.570 --> 00:46:16.960
Okay.

[ Inaudible Comment ]

00:46:19.050 --> 00:46:20.350
Someone has to.

00:46:20.350 --> 00:46:24.310
Okay. A fascinating character
and I don't know how much

00:46:24.310 --> 00:46:27.500
of his life we can put back
together at a distance of,

00:46:27.500 --> 00:46:30.240
you know, a century
and a half, now.

00:46:30.240 --> 00:46:33.500
But he, we all, we are
all in his great debt

00:46:33.500 --> 00:46:34.800
for the work that he did.

00:46:34.800 --> 00:46:40.280
But, yes. And so, he may have
a hand, he certainly has a hand

00:46:40.280 --> 00:46:44.830
in all the material that's
in Saint Petersburg, today.

00:46:44.830 --> 00:46:47.400
And he may even have had a
hand in this text, as well.

00:46:47.400 --> 00:46:48.700
Thank you.

00:46:48.700 --> 00:46:50.640
