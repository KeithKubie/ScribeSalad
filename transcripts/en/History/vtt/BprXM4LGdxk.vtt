00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:01.830
RICK: How can I help you?

00:00:01.830 --> 00:00:03.380
Well, I have a coin here.

00:00:03.380 --> 00:00:06.040
It's a portrait coin of
Julius Caesar from the month

00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:07.880
before he got assassinated.

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:09.170
RICK: OK.

00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:12.170
ILYA: This coin is
really interesting.

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:13.790
RICK: Yeah, this is cool.
Yes.

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:15.540
I think I was actually Caesar
in a different lifetime.

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:17.830
[laughs]

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:21.330
ILYA: I'm coming
into the shop today

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:24.210
because I have a
portrait Julius Caesar

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:26.000
coin that I want to sell.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.750
I believe it's a key piece to
any historical coin collection.

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:33.080
I'm hoping to sell
it for $4,400.

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:34.750
But I absolutely love it,
so I'm not going to take

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:37.420
any lowball offer for it.

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:38.540
RICK: Yeah, this is cool.

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:40.920
I mean, you have
Caesar Dictator.

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:42.540
One of the neat things
is is where it says

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:45.040
Dictator on the front of it--

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:47.330
that's a negative term nowadays.

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:49.250
But back then, it wasn't.

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:53.330
During times of war,
they would assign

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:55.080
a person the title Dictator.

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:59.420
And a Dictator would do what
was necessary to preserve

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:00.750
the Republic.

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:02.210
After Julius Caesar
was assassinated,

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:04.460
there was a real
power vacuum in Rome.

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:06.750
And it wasn't until
Octavius that basically

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:08.620
straightened everything out.

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:12.290
The great thing about this
is it's a 2000-year-old coin

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:13.960
with Caesar's face on it.

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:15.960
And I want it.

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:17.620
So are you looking to sell it?

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:19.080
ILYA: Yeah.
- OK.

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:20.080
How much were you
looking to get out of it?

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:21.460
I want $4,400 please.

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:22.080
RICK: OK.

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:29.620
There's a million variables,
especially with ancient coins.

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:31.790
And quite frankly,
I don't know enough.

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:35.290
I don't know if that's
a good price or not.

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:36.880
Do you mind if I have
someone look at it?

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:38.040
Sure.
Please.

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:39.080
All right.
I'll be right back.

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:40.920
ILYA: Thank you.

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:42.790
I'm really excited that
an expert is coming in

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:44.830
to attest to its authenticity.

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:47.500
RICK: Since the Roman Empire
doesn't exist anymore,

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:49.500
it's not illegal to
fake these coins.

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:52.000
And I have to find out
if this is the real deal.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.250
So I called in Dave.

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:55.620
This is the coin.

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:57.500
DAVID VAGI: OK.

00:01:57.500 --> 00:01:58.960
Julius Caesar.

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:01.290
Few names in history
ring with the familiarity

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:02.830
of Julius Caesar.

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:04.580
You know, there's Napoleon.

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:06.960
You know, a few of the
people you can throw in.

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:09.290
His murder inspired Shakespeare.
- Yeah.

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:13.000
DAVID VAGI: I mean, this is
a serious bit of history.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.750
This particular coin was
struck within 30 days prior

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:19.420
to Julius Caesar's murder.

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:23.170
Many historians believe that
the fact that his portrait

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:25.920
appeared on a coin
was one of the things

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:28.880
that led to his murder.

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:30.540
RICK: So is it real?

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:32.170
Do you mind if I take
it out and look at it?

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:33.120
Yeah.
Sure.

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:33.500
Go ahead.
Examine it.

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:39.330
DAVID VAGI: The
strike is perfect.

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:41.540
The style is correct.

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:42.710
Everything is right.

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:43.880
RICK: OK.

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:45.380
DAVID VAGI: It's
perfectly genuine.

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:46.710
All right.

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:49.960
So what do you
think it's worth?

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:52.120
DAVID VAGI: When you
get a coin like this,

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:54.380
there's no shortage of buyers.

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:57.210
When they are in
fantastic condition,

00:02:57.210 --> 00:02:59.540
the very best of these have
brought in the neighborhood

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:01.710
of $200,000 each.

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:03.170
RICK: OK.

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:04.880
DAVID VAGI: But there's
a good amount of wear.

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:06.540
It's circulated.

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:12.000
And I think this is worth in
the neighborhood of $1,500.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:13.330
RICK: Retail?
- Retail.

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:14.750
RICK: OK.

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:16.380
ILYA: To me, it seems
almost ridiculous

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:17.880
that somebody would
sell it that low,

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:19.580
especially when they
knew its history.

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:22.080
DAVID VAGI: Well,
I'm basing it on what

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:24.750
I've seen them sell for
in auctions in Europe

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:25.750
and the United States.

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:27.500
But the decision is yours.

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:29.080
Thanks for coming in, man.
All righty, man.

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:31.420
One last question--
where can I

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:32.580
get these for such low prices?

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:38.750
ILYA: I understand why the
seller is not happy with that.

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:41.830
You know, the fact is these
things are undervalued.

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:45.000
And it's probably best
that he holds onto it

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:49.040
because the bottom line is it's
difficult to replace for less

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:51.960
than its current market value.

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:55.120
RICK: Dave-- he's been in the
coin business his entire life.

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:59.290
And I'm gonna take his opinion.

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:04.290
You know, I'd give you
$1,000 for the coin.

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:05.880
ILYA: Is this a real offer?
Or--

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:06.920
RICK: That's a legitimate offer.

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:07.960
Yeah.

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:09.620
That's not a legitimate offer.

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:12.380
You're just using your position
here trying to buy something

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:14.750
for below its market value.

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:16.790
RICK: The way market value
is determined is when

00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:18.460
two people agree on a price.

00:04:18.460 --> 00:04:19.790
If you don't like my price,
you don't have to take it.

00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:21.290
- How about $4,000?
- No.

00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:23.960
There's no money to be made.

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:26.250
I have final offer
for you. $3,500.

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:27.460
And I'll take cash,
100 dollar bills.

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:32.790
I guess we're not
gonna make a deal, man.

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:34.330
Your loss, my friend.

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:35.830
- Thanks for coming in.
- Thank you.

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:37.290
Have a nice one.

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:40.420
The offer of $1,000 is
absolutely ridiculous.

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:41.830
I'm going to hold
onto the coin, and I'm

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:43.000
going to try to
sell it to someone

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.250
else that could
actually appreciate

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:48.250
its true historical value.
