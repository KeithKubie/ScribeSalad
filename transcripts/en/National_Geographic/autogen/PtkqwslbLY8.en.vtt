00:00:00.325 --> 00:00:02.300
(ambient music)

00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:04.413
- [Narrator] Born from
primordial stardust,

00:00:04.413 --> 00:00:06.350
4.5 billion years ago,

00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:09.570
Jupiter was the solar
system's first planet.

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:11.320
And much like its namesake,

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:13.780
the king of the ancient Roman gods,

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:16.083
Jupiter was destined for greatness.

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:21.490
Jupiter is the fifth planet from the sun,

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:24.360
and the largest planet
in the solar system.

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:26.870
At approximately 11 earths wide,

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:28.930
Jupiter has twice the amount of mass

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:30.833
as the other planets put together.

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:35.030
But, unlike Earth, and the
three other terrestrial worlds,

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:37.420
Jupiter has no solid surface.

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:40.970
It may not even have a
traditionally solid core.

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:44.720
Rather, this giant planet may
have a dense, liquid center

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:48.873
surround by a worldwide ocean
of hydrogen and helium gases.

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:51.940
Jupiter's gassiest composition

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:54.600
can be observed in its atmosphere.

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.470
About 44 miles thick,

00:00:56.470 --> 00:00:59.360
the atmosphere is a canvas
of stripes and storms,

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:01.800
churning across the giant planet.

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:04.650
Their colors range
between shades of whites,

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:07.220
yellows, browns, and reds,

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:10.443
all caused by the different
chemical make up of each area.

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:14.520
Probably the most iconic
feature of Jupiter,

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.930
is a crimson brown
storm that's been raging

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:20.443
for over 300 years, the Great Red Spot.

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:23.810
It's a giant, swirling
collection of clouds

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:27.350
with wind speeds of up
to 400 miles per hour,

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:29.340
at least two and half times faster

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.633
than category five hurricanes.

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:35.690
Floating hundreds of miles
above the storms of Jupiter,

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:40.690
are about 79 moons, the most
of the eight known planets.

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:45.190
The four largest moons were
discovered by Galileo in 1610.

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:48.090
Called the Galilean
Satellites, they include:

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:51.130
Io, the most volcanically
active celestial body

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:52.750
in the solar system;

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:55.480
Ganymede, the solar system's largest moon,

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:58.080
even larger than the planet Mercury;

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:01.640
and Callisto and Europa,
which along with Ganymede,

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:05.263
may contain oceans of liquid
water underneath their crusts.

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:09.730
Jupiter's large collection of
moons is only made possible

00:02:09.730 --> 00:02:13.270
by the planet's massive
size and gravitational pull,

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:16.770
the strongest of all the
planets in the solar system.

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:19.770
This incredible gravity
also influence the sizes

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:21.453
of the seven other planets.

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:26.010
During the solar system's
earliest days, Jupiter,

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:27.950
being the first planet to form,

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:30.090
attracted and destroyed space debris

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:33.640
that would've helped the
other planets grow in size.

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:36.210
Today, that force may serve as a shield

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:38.130
by attracting comets and asteroids

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:40.240
onto Jupiter's own surface,

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:43.413
preventing them from crashing
onto inner planets like Earth.

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:46.460
Apart from the sun,

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:50.370
Jupiter has become the dominant
figure in the solar system,

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:52.260
thereby earning its place at the top

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.761
of the planetary heap as king.

00:02:54.761 --> 00:02:57.928
(ominous tonal music)
