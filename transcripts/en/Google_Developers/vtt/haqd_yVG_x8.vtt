00:00:08.297 --> 00:00:10.825
Welcome to
Google Developers Hackademy,

00:00:10.825 --> 00:00:13.759
this is the 4th part of the
Google Apps Script course

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:16.924
created by Antonio Guzman
from GDG Androidtitlan Mexico.

00:00:16.924 --> 00:00:18.990
If this is your first contact
with the course,

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:22.231
I recommend you watch it
in order and do the exercises.

00:00:29.033 --> 00:00:32.033
Welcome to the 4th lesson
of the Google App Script

00:00:32.033 --> 00:00:34.495
introduction course.
I'm Antonio Guzman.

00:00:34.495 --> 00:00:36.726
Today we will integrate a script

00:00:36.726 --> 00:00:38.627
to a Google Form

00:00:38.627 --> 00:00:41.594
and we'll communicate it
through the Gmail service.

00:00:41.594 --> 00:00:44.561
Today's theme will be
the basic interaction

00:00:44.561 --> 00:00:47.627
with a Google Form,
container-bound scripts,

00:00:47.627 --> 00:00:49.198
container extension,

00:00:49.495 --> 00:00:51.231
Gmail's API,

00:00:51.231 --> 00:00:52.594
Spreadsheet's

00:00:52.594 --> 00:00:54.165
and Document's.

00:00:54.396 --> 00:00:55.792
And this time,

00:00:55.792 --> 00:00:58.231
we're going to use
container-bound scripts,

00:00:58.231 --> 00:01:00.363
which is a concept
we already know,

00:01:00.363 --> 00:01:02.891
but it's worth remembering
that they're those

00:01:02.891 --> 00:01:05.858
only accessible
from Google Spreadsheet

00:01:05.858 --> 00:01:07.363
and Google Document,

00:01:07.363 --> 00:01:09.528
not from our Drive unit.

00:01:09.858 --> 00:01:12.528
So we get further knowledge,

00:01:12.528 --> 00:01:16.033
we'll integrate another service,
this time, Gmail,

00:01:16.033 --> 00:01:19.330
which will clearly allow us
to send e-mails

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:20.759
with some data.

00:01:20.792 --> 00:01:23.957
We intend to capture
some information

00:01:23.957 --> 00:01:25.495
through the form.

00:01:25.495 --> 00:01:27.297
We'll get a name,

00:01:27.297 --> 00:01:30.033
an e-mail address
and a type of document.

00:01:30.033 --> 00:01:33.165
Once the information
is in our spreadsheet,

00:01:33.165 --> 00:01:35.726
the script will create a file

00:01:35.726 --> 00:01:37.528
of the type indicated

00:01:37.528 --> 00:01:41.495
and we'll send an e-mail
to those who registered,

00:01:41.495 --> 00:01:43.858
including and attachment.

00:01:43.858 --> 00:01:45.660
LET'S GET TO WORK

00:01:46.297 --> 00:01:48.231
Let's enter Drive.

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:51.693
Let's select
"create a document,"

00:01:51.693 --> 00:01:54.165
in this case, a Form.

00:01:54.462 --> 00:01:58.726
With it we will pose
a couple of questions,

00:01:59.693 --> 00:02:02.627
an open question
and a multiple choice question.

00:02:02.891 --> 00:02:06.066
We then select
the template we will use:

00:02:06.066 --> 00:02:09.231
"gas form."
Always using "gas."

00:02:09.957 --> 00:02:12.759
We click on "OK"
and we now have our form.

00:02:12.759 --> 00:02:15.363
Now we need to add
the questions.

00:02:15.363 --> 00:02:18.297
The first, what do we want?
The name

00:02:18.297 --> 00:02:20.660
of the persons
that will register.

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:23.165
So we will ask them to write it.

00:02:23.165 --> 00:02:25.264
"Write your name."

00:02:25.891 --> 00:02:28.231
What type of question is this?

00:02:28.528 --> 00:02:31.132
It's a text question.

00:02:31.759 --> 00:02:35.231
And let's make it
mandatory, required.

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:37.594
Let's continue...

00:02:38.231 --> 00:02:40.297
We scroll down...

00:02:40.297 --> 00:02:43.627
Done. So now we will add
another element.

00:02:43.627 --> 00:02:46.825
The next piece of information
we want is an e-mail,

00:02:46.825 --> 00:02:50.264
so we ask them to write
their e-mail address.

00:02:50.264 --> 00:02:52.891
Write it.
"Write your e-mail."

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:56.033
What type of question is this?

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:58.594
It's also a text question,

00:02:59.231 --> 00:03:02.264
but we will apply
a validation to it.

00:03:02.561 --> 00:03:05.759
We're going to verify
that what's written there

00:03:05.759 --> 00:03:09.462
has the right format
for an e-mail address.

00:03:09.462 --> 00:03:13.165
We scroll down again,
we're losing it there...

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:17.231
And this one we will set it...

00:03:19.099 --> 00:03:21.561
as a required field...

00:03:22.396 --> 00:03:23.396
And...

00:03:23.792 --> 00:03:24.924
Let's see...

00:03:25.396 --> 00:03:28.429
let's check, yes, it's "Text,"
that's what we want.

00:03:28.429 --> 00:03:30.132
Right choice...

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:33.561
Text is also what's going to be
inserted there,

00:03:33.561 --> 00:03:37.330
and the e-mail validation,
that's what we want.

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:41.396
That's also mandatory,
it's a required field.

00:03:41.396 --> 00:03:44.957
Did you notice it shows
that classic red asterisk?

00:03:44.957 --> 00:03:45.957
There it is.

00:03:45.957 --> 00:03:48.297
The next one
won't be a text question,

00:03:48.297 --> 00:03:50.132
but a multiple choice one,

00:03:50.132 --> 00:03:53.330
because we want the user
to be able to choose

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:57.132
one of two,
so we will ask him to select

00:03:57.132 --> 00:04:00.924
the type of file to create,

00:04:00.924 --> 00:04:03.297
the type of document, which is

00:04:03.297 --> 00:04:06.297
the first option,
a Drive Document.

00:04:06.693 --> 00:04:09.264
So option 1: Document.

00:04:10.297 --> 00:04:13.132
Option 2: a Spreadsheet.

00:04:13.396 --> 00:04:15.858
We're going to be working
with those two.

00:04:16.726 --> 00:04:18.759
Spreadsheet.

00:04:19.231 --> 00:04:20.462
We got it.

00:04:21.264 --> 00:04:25.033
We got all the options.
This is mandatory too.

00:04:25.792 --> 00:04:27.726
Now let's save it.

00:04:28.198 --> 00:04:29.198
Done.

00:04:29.198 --> 00:04:32.792
Now our form is complete.

00:04:33.924 --> 00:04:37.726
Now let's select a destination
for the information.

00:04:37.726 --> 00:04:40.891
As we can see,
it gives us a spreadsheet

00:04:40.891 --> 00:04:42.495
by predetermination,

00:04:42.495 --> 00:04:44.693
we just need to change
its name:

00:04:44.693 --> 00:04:46.759
"spreadsheet gas form."

00:04:47.462 --> 00:04:49.528
Then we confirm it.

00:04:50.396 --> 00:04:53.297
And now we have associated
this spreadsheet

00:04:53.297 --> 00:04:56.363
to the responses to our form.

00:04:57.429 --> 00:05:00.858
Now let's see our form live,

00:05:00.858 --> 00:05:03.165
as we would see it
in the Web.

00:05:04.792 --> 00:05:07.726
There it is, we can see
the template we had set.

00:05:07.726 --> 00:05:10.627
Let's register.
I write my name, Antonio,

00:05:10.627 --> 00:05:13.066
and my e-mail address:

00:05:13.066 --> 00:05:16.924
cuauhtli17@...

00:05:18.627 --> 00:05:20.462
we wait for the "@"...

00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:24.693
"@," there you go, gmail.com.

00:05:25.429 --> 00:05:28.627
And we select one. Which one?
One of two: Document.

00:05:28.627 --> 00:05:31.792
That way we've completed
the information requested,

00:05:31.792 --> 00:05:33.924
now let's save it and submit it.

00:05:33.924 --> 00:05:35.165
"Submit."

00:05:36.825 --> 00:05:39.891
This way we'd have
one registration, but...

00:05:40.396 --> 00:05:42.363
let's make one more

00:05:42.363 --> 00:05:45.198
to see the other option
of the spreadsheet.

00:05:45.825 --> 00:05:48.660
The same, "To–o",
we don't have a "–" key,

00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:51.297
so we leave it as "Tono"...

00:05:51.297 --> 00:05:53.792
the e-mail address is the same,

00:05:53.792 --> 00:05:56.066
and now we select "Spreadsheet."

00:05:56.066 --> 00:05:57.462
We submit it...

00:05:58.561 --> 00:06:01.957
There's the spreadsheet
that we selected

00:06:01.957 --> 00:06:04.990
to store the information
sent by the users

00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:06.792
through the form.

00:06:07.429 --> 00:06:08.792
It's loading...

00:06:08.792 --> 00:06:11.033
It's called
"spreadsheet gas form,"

00:06:11.033 --> 00:06:14.495
and there we have the 2
registrations we just inserted.

00:06:14.957 --> 00:06:18.363
We put 3 questions,
therefor we have 3 columns,

00:06:18.363 --> 00:06:21.396
their 3 correspondent columns
with their responses,

00:06:21.396 --> 00:06:23.528
apart from a first column

00:06:23.528 --> 00:06:26.429
which has the timestamp
for the information.

00:06:26.429 --> 00:06:30.033
Now let's build our script.
You know: Tools &gt; Script Editor.

00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:36.165
It means we'll build
a container-bound script...

00:06:38.363 --> 00:06:42.330
and another script, you know,
the welcome screen,

00:06:44.264 --> 00:06:48.132
a blank project,
we want it all empty,

00:06:48.132 --> 00:06:50.627
we will build it from scratch.

00:06:51.561 --> 00:06:54.363
Now let's name our script,

00:06:54.891 --> 00:06:57.132
in this case: "gas04,"

00:06:58.132 --> 00:07:01.792
and we're going to start
writing our function.

00:07:02.693 --> 00:07:06.396
We will reference
our spreadsheet.

00:07:06.660 --> 00:07:08.726
"var sheet"...

00:07:09.528 --> 00:07:12.165
We'll reference the sheet,

00:07:12.165 --> 00:07:13.495
so...

00:07:14.165 --> 00:07:16.594
we use the SpreadsheetApp class

00:07:16.594 --> 00:07:20.429
and we get the one active
in the context

00:07:20.429 --> 00:07:23.297
in which
we're calling our script.

00:07:24.858 --> 00:07:28.660
Now let's create
another variable called Òrows."

00:07:29.264 --> 00:07:32.330
In this one we will associate

00:07:32.957 --> 00:07:36.726
the data that we have
in our form,

00:07:37.330 --> 00:07:40.792
the registrations we have,
so we bring

00:07:40.792 --> 00:07:43.726
all that data range we have.

00:07:43.726 --> 00:07:47.396
So we're going to iterate
that data arrangement.

00:07:47.594 --> 00:07:49.528
In order to do it correctly,

00:07:49.528 --> 00:07:52.165
we're going to create
an auxiliary variable.

00:07:52.165 --> 00:07:54.429
Because, if you noticed,

00:07:55.495 --> 00:07:57.891
we had an extra registration,

00:07:57.891 --> 00:07:59.528
which was the tops,

00:07:59.528 --> 00:08:02.462
but we're not doing
anything with the tops,

00:08:02.462 --> 00:08:06.033
so we will use "numRows"
as an auxiliary.

00:08:07.198 --> 00:08:08.198
So...

00:08:09.165 --> 00:08:12.231
now we can get the values.

00:08:13.594 --> 00:08:16.330
So we declare our variable,

00:08:16.330 --> 00:08:18.858
and on "rows" we get

00:08:19.891 --> 00:08:22.792
this bidimensional arrangement
with all the data.

00:08:23.627 --> 00:08:26.792
We already know we have
to use the method "getValues."

00:08:27.462 --> 00:08:29.825
"getValues."

00:08:31.099 --> 00:08:34.693
We hit "autocomplete"
to avoid mistakes...

00:08:35.462 --> 00:08:36.825
a semicolon...

00:08:37.132 --> 00:08:40.165
We finish our sentence.
We already have the data,

00:08:40.165 --> 00:08:41.924
now what comes next

00:08:41.924 --> 00:08:44.858
is starting to operate
on that arrangement

00:08:45.198 --> 00:08:48.066
to be able to easily extract it

00:08:48.066 --> 00:08:50.363
and start building what we want.

00:08:50.363 --> 00:08:52.396
We're going to do it
inside a "for."

00:08:52.396 --> 00:08:54.528
We'll use "for" as an auxiliary.

00:08:54.792 --> 00:08:56.165
We assemble it...

00:08:56.924 --> 00:08:58.165
semicolon...

00:09:00.033 --> 00:09:01.033
and...

00:09:02.330 --> 00:09:05.627
we'll start iterating.
We will use a variable "i"

00:09:06.132 --> 00:09:09.033
that will start from position 1.

00:09:10.528 --> 00:09:14.330
Then, "i" always has to be
less-than

00:09:15.297 --> 00:09:19.198
the number of rows, the variable
we declared above,

00:09:20.429 --> 00:09:23.693
and so, you know,
so it goes on,

00:09:23.693 --> 00:09:25.561
we add an increment.

00:09:27.561 --> 00:09:30.495
"i++."

00:09:34.396 --> 00:09:36.759
There it is, our "i++."

00:09:38.264 --> 00:09:41.792
So we start extracting
the data we have

00:09:41.792 --> 00:09:43.792
in each one of those rows.

00:09:46.099 --> 00:09:49.561
We have a mail,
so let's extract it now.

00:09:49.858 --> 00:09:51.066
From where?

00:09:52.132 --> 00:09:53.396
From "values".

00:09:53.924 --> 00:09:56.594
And we put its
corresponding index.

00:09:56.594 --> 00:09:58.627
Which is? Index 2,

00:09:58.627 --> 00:10:00.726
because it's the third column.

00:10:03.561 --> 00:10:06.396
And, remember, since it's
a bidimensional array,

00:10:06.396 --> 00:10:08.792
we have to put
the reference too,

00:10:08.792 --> 00:10:11.495
so now we get the name.

00:10:12.198 --> 00:10:14.429
"name = values,"

00:10:15.066 --> 00:10:17.660
so it gets it
from position "i".

00:10:17.660 --> 00:10:20.297
And now
its corresponding column,

00:10:20.297 --> 00:10:21.858
which is column 2.

00:10:21.858 --> 00:10:23.825
It has another index, 1.

00:10:24.330 --> 00:10:26.858
We'll get the type
of document

00:10:26.858 --> 00:10:29.198
the user was requesting,

00:10:29.198 --> 00:10:30.759
which is the file,

00:10:30.759 --> 00:10:32.825
we iterate on "values..."

00:10:33.132 --> 00:10:34.330
the index,

00:10:35.594 --> 00:10:39.198
which we already have,
and now an auxiliary variable.

00:10:39.726 --> 00:10:42.726
We will use it later on.
We will name it "file."

00:10:43.066 --> 00:10:46.099
There. Now we have the data.
We have to validate it

00:10:46.099 --> 00:10:47.726
so we know what to do.

00:10:47.726 --> 00:10:50.627
If they want Document
or a Spreadsheet.

00:10:50.726 --> 00:10:52.495
Let's put an "if,"

00:10:52.495 --> 00:10:54.858
a classic "if else" structure.

00:10:55.693 --> 00:10:57.132
"if file"

00:10:57.792 --> 00:11:02.495
equals the chain "Document"

00:11:04.462 --> 00:11:05.627
Docu...

00:11:06.033 --> 00:11:07.363
Document.

00:11:08.330 --> 00:11:11.891
So when that condition happens,
when it is true,

00:11:11.891 --> 00:11:14.396
we're going
to create a document.

00:11:14.396 --> 00:11:17.231
So we put our variable:

00:11:17.231 --> 00:11:21.693
"doc = DocumentApp..."

00:11:23.363 --> 00:11:25.858
We use this class,
"Document..."

00:11:25.858 --> 00:11:27.957
"DocumentApp." There you go.

00:11:28.462 --> 00:11:30.495
What do we want?
To create something,

00:11:30.495 --> 00:11:32.990
so we use a "create" method

00:11:32.990 --> 00:11:36.297
and we'll give it
the name of that document.

00:11:36.594 --> 00:11:39.231
Remember,
it's a text chain, so:

00:11:40.264 --> 00:11:43.726
"Document -04..."

00:11:45.891 --> 00:11:47.891
and we will concatenate

00:11:47.891 --> 00:11:51.726
the name of the user
that requests the file.

00:11:51.726 --> 00:11:53.858
So we concatenate it

00:11:54.957 --> 00:11:58.297
and now let's put
some content into it.

00:11:58.297 --> 00:12:01.363
How? As we did it
in the previous lessons,

00:12:01.363 --> 00:12:04.363
with the object.
We get its body,

00:12:05.594 --> 00:12:09.363
and then we use the method
"appendParagraph,"

00:12:09.825 --> 00:12:12.825
which will allow us
to add the content.

00:12:13.132 --> 00:12:15.594
The content will be
a text chain,

00:12:15.594 --> 00:12:17.099
so we pass it to it...

00:12:17.396 --> 00:12:19.825
And we're going to write:

00:12:19.825 --> 00:12:22.726
"Congratulations, you're now
using Google Apps Script."

00:12:22.726 --> 00:12:26.297
We now have our text
in our document.

00:12:26.627 --> 00:12:29.561
Now, let's use
the variable "file"

00:12:29.924 --> 00:12:32.891
as an auxiliary,
and we take the reference.

00:12:32.891 --> 00:12:35.627
Now we use the class
"DriveApp"

00:12:35.957 --> 00:12:38.429
and we will bring

00:12:39.264 --> 00:12:40.396
that...

00:12:42.066 --> 00:12:44.198
that file through its ID.

00:12:44.198 --> 00:12:47.627
So we use "doc.getID,"

00:12:47.627 --> 00:12:50.957
and now we have a reference
to that document.

00:12:50.957 --> 00:12:52.858
We will use it later on.

00:12:52.858 --> 00:12:55.396
And what happened
when it wasn't Document?

00:12:55.396 --> 00:12:57.132
It was the other case,

00:12:57.132 --> 00:12:58.594
the Spreadsheet case.

00:12:58.594 --> 00:13:01.957
There were 2 options only,
there's nothing left to validate

00:13:01.957 --> 00:13:03.792
and we will submit that one.

00:13:03.990 --> 00:13:06.924
And with "else"
we cover both cases,

00:13:06.924 --> 00:13:09.429
so we're going to create
a Spreadsheet.

00:13:09.429 --> 00:13:13.495
When there's not a document,
we need to create a Spreadsheet.

00:13:13.495 --> 00:13:14.957
"SpreadsheetApp"

00:13:14.957 --> 00:13:17.165
and let's use
the method "create..."

00:13:17.792 --> 00:13:20.462
which also receives
a text chain,

00:13:20.462 --> 00:13:24.429
in this case, the text will be
the name of this spreadsheet.

00:13:26.363 --> 00:13:28.495
We write it...

00:13:28.924 --> 00:13:31.462
"GAS 04..."

00:13:32.330 --> 00:13:36.198
and we will also concatenate
the name to customize it,

00:13:36.198 --> 00:13:38.891
the name of the person
who requested

00:13:38.891 --> 00:13:40.990
this type of file.

00:13:41.759 --> 00:13:44.330
We concatenate with "+,"
name...

00:13:45.264 --> 00:13:48.132
We finish, ";" and the next one,

00:13:48.132 --> 00:13:51.957
which is "var sheet."
We'll reference that 1st sheet

00:13:51.957 --> 00:13:54.429
that our spreadsheet has.

00:13:54.726 --> 00:13:58.363
So "get.Sheets,"
remember, it's an array

00:13:58.363 --> 00:14:01.825
of all the sheets it has.
We just want the first one,

00:14:01.825 --> 00:14:05.429
so we reference
the first element.

00:14:06.660 --> 00:14:09.132
Once we have the sheet,

00:14:09.132 --> 00:14:13.066
we will determine
the location for the value.

00:14:14.033 --> 00:14:16.363
That we will do
by means of a range,

00:14:16.363 --> 00:14:18.858
and we want it
in the first cell.

00:14:18.858 --> 00:14:20.792
So it's: "1, 1."

00:14:21.165 --> 00:14:22.990
Row 1, column 1.

00:14:24.297 --> 00:14:26.792
And now we can add

00:14:27.165 --> 00:14:28.462
"setValue..."

00:14:29.957 --> 00:14:33.330
and once again it will be a text

00:14:34.066 --> 00:14:37.957
to cheer you guys up:

00:14:38.792 --> 00:14:41.990
"Congratulations,
you're now using GAS."

00:14:41.990 --> 00:14:44.495
Google Apps Script.
"You're using GAS."

00:14:46.198 --> 00:14:49.132
And, once again,
we use the variable "file"

00:14:49.132 --> 00:14:52.165
to reference it from DriveApp,

00:14:52.165 --> 00:14:54.528
"file = DriveApp,"

00:14:56.066 --> 00:14:59.429
and we'll bring that reference
through the ID

00:14:59.726 --> 00:15:03.033
of the spreadsheet we created.
So through ID:

00:15:04.099 --> 00:15:08.792
"sps" and we ask it
to bring its ID.

00:15:10.726 --> 00:15:11.891
"get...

00:15:13.165 --> 00:15:14.363
ID."

00:15:14.363 --> 00:15:15.924
We got it.

00:15:16.957 --> 00:15:18.297
Then we save it...

00:15:20.198 --> 00:15:22.429
";", we finish our sentence.

00:15:22.429 --> 00:15:24.429
Now, what we want to do

00:15:24.429 --> 00:15:27.495
is send that information
by e-mail.

00:15:28.264 --> 00:15:30.099
So now he have

00:15:30.099 --> 00:15:32.033
to use "GmailApp"

00:15:32.033 --> 00:15:34.363
which has a method called
"send mail."

00:15:34.363 --> 00:15:36.627
"Send mail" has two variants:

00:15:36.627 --> 00:15:39.330
the simple one, and the one
that supports options.

00:15:39.330 --> 00:15:41.891
We will use the second one,

00:15:41.891 --> 00:15:44.429
because we want to include
an attachment.

00:15:44.429 --> 00:15:47.132
If you see it,
it's pretty easy to use.

00:15:47.132 --> 00:15:49.957
It needs a recipient, which one?

00:15:49.957 --> 00:15:52.660
The e-mail of the person
that registered.

00:15:52.660 --> 00:15:55.198
Then, we add a subject.

00:15:55.198 --> 00:15:59.066
There we will write
a generic subject.

00:15:59.429 --> 00:16:04.099
Let's write it. We're not
going to customize it this time.

00:16:04.561 --> 00:16:05.924
"GAS-L4"

00:16:06.429 --> 00:16:10.198
and a message body.

00:16:10.198 --> 00:16:13.198
This body is limited to 20 Kb,

00:16:13.198 --> 00:16:15.825
we can't fit a bigger one there.

00:16:15.825 --> 00:16:18.330
Anyway, it's a small text.

00:16:18.330 --> 00:16:22.330
We'll customize it
by putting a general salutation,

00:16:22.924 --> 00:16:26.264
but what's going to change
is the name

00:16:26.264 --> 00:16:30.924
of each user that has
filled out the form.

00:16:32.396 --> 00:16:33.495
Now...

00:16:34.132 --> 00:16:37.033
What are we missing?
We have the body message,

00:16:37.033 --> 00:16:40.297
let's add our attachment.

00:16:40.297 --> 00:16:43.726
It's worth mentioning
that the options are written

00:16:43.726 --> 00:16:46.693
by using the JavaScript
Object Notation

00:16:47.363 --> 00:16:49.165
so we'll do it that way.

00:16:50.297 --> 00:16:52.924
The property we will use
is "attachment"

00:16:53.759 --> 00:16:56.726
and then we will put its value.

00:16:56.924 --> 00:16:58.495
What would that be?

00:16:58.495 --> 00:16:59.990
A file. Which one?

00:17:00.693 --> 00:17:03.990
The one we created
some lines above.

00:17:04.825 --> 00:17:05.990
Now we save it.

00:17:05.990 --> 00:17:09.099
Now we have the main part
of our functionality,

00:17:09.099 --> 00:17:13.033
but we also wanted to build
a container-type script,

00:17:13.033 --> 00:17:14.594
container extension...

00:17:15.924 --> 00:17:19.099
so we can add a menu.
Let's insert another function,

00:17:19.099 --> 00:17:21.825
the one we already know:
"function onOpen,"

00:17:21.825 --> 00:17:24.726
and what we're going
to implement in that

00:17:25.132 --> 00:17:27.396
is a menu from which,

00:17:27.396 --> 00:17:29.825
every time you enter the sheet,

00:17:29.825 --> 00:17:32.132
you can send the mails,

00:17:32.132 --> 00:17:33.858
by choosing a menu option,

00:17:33.858 --> 00:17:35.759
by clicking on a button.

00:17:35.957 --> 00:17:37.693
Class SpreadsheetApp,

00:17:37.693 --> 00:17:39.594
to reference

00:17:39.594 --> 00:17:42.660
that sheet that's active,

00:17:43.792 --> 00:17:46.363
"getActiveSpreadsheet",

00:17:49.099 --> 00:17:51.957
and let's build the menu.

00:17:52.924 --> 00:17:57.198
This is an arrangement
in which you include the text,

00:17:57.825 --> 00:18:00.759
that will be the name
of the submenu,

00:18:01.363 --> 00:18:04.198
and the function with which
it will be mapped.

00:18:04.627 --> 00:18:06.462
Send e-mail...

00:18:07.099 --> 00:18:10.561
That's how it will appear
on the screen once you see it.

00:18:10.858 --> 00:18:12.759
That's what
the submenu will read.

00:18:12.759 --> 00:18:15.396
And what function
is it mapped to?

00:18:15.396 --> 00:18:18.561
To the one we just created
or implemented minutes ago:

00:18:18.561 --> 00:18:19.627
"myFunction."

00:18:20.594 --> 00:18:23.099
Now everything's set.
What's left?

00:18:23.099 --> 00:18:26.495
Add it to the spreadsheet,
in this case,

00:18:26.495 --> 00:18:29.132
to the first sheet.

00:18:29.132 --> 00:18:32.165
Let's put it outside
because we're leaving it

00:18:32.165 --> 00:18:35.396
in the same body
as "myFunction"

00:18:35.396 --> 00:18:37.825
and that has to be separate.

00:18:38.627 --> 00:18:39.891
We paste it...

00:18:41.660 --> 00:18:43.297
And now we got it right,

00:18:43.297 --> 00:18:46.693
otherwise, it wouldn't
recognize it as an adequate...

00:18:48.429 --> 00:18:49.627
function...

00:18:49.627 --> 00:18:52.792
to our purposes.
So, now we can do it,

00:18:53.396 --> 00:18:57.165
we will put the menu
on the sheet

00:18:58.198 --> 00:19:00.660
and... there it is.

00:19:01.330 --> 00:19:02.495
Come on...

00:19:04.066 --> 00:19:07.396
And we will name this menu...

00:19:07.957 --> 00:19:10.825
Let's go to "Sender script"
and there we have

00:19:10.825 --> 00:19:12.957
a "send e-mail" option.
Let's select it

00:19:12.957 --> 00:19:14.825
and our script starts to run.

00:19:14.825 --> 00:19:16.792
It lets us know it's done.

00:19:16.792 --> 00:19:18.924
So, right now,

00:19:18.924 --> 00:19:22.132
we can go to our e-mail inbox

00:19:22.561 --> 00:19:25.726
and verify that the mails
are really there.

00:19:26.165 --> 00:19:27.759
So let's go to Gmail.

00:19:27.759 --> 00:19:29.858
There they are, both mails,

00:19:29.858 --> 00:19:32.396
because I entered
my e-mail address twice.

00:19:33.132 --> 00:19:34.693
We open one of them...

00:19:34.990 --> 00:19:36.660
and there is our mail.

00:19:36.660 --> 00:19:39.660
We can see there is
an attachment included

00:19:39.660 --> 00:19:42.462
and the customized salutation
we'd added:

00:19:42.462 --> 00:19:44.858
"Hello, user" and that's it.

00:19:45.561 --> 00:19:48.363
Let's go back, there's the data.
Go to Tools,

00:19:48.363 --> 00:19:51.825
Script Editor, y let's verify
that this information

00:19:51.825 --> 00:19:55.693
we saw in the e-mail
is the same as that we wrote

00:19:56.297 --> 00:19:58.726
in the script, in the body.

00:19:59.429 --> 00:20:01.165
There it is.

00:20:01.165 --> 00:20:03.099
The customized salutation:

00:20:04.660 --> 00:20:06.891
"Thank you for registering."

00:20:07.759 --> 00:20:10.792
And we go back to Drive
to verify

00:20:10.792 --> 00:20:14.231
that the documents
we'd requested really exist.

00:20:14.231 --> 00:20:17.165
There they are, a document
and a spreadsheet.

00:20:17.165 --> 00:20:18.924
So we open the document...

00:20:19.924 --> 00:20:21.429
and there's the body:

00:20:21.429 --> 00:20:24.660
"Congratulations, you're now
using Google Apps Script."

00:20:25.132 --> 00:20:27.759
And so we've finished
our exercise.

00:20:29.033 --> 00:20:31.198
With this example
we've given you,

00:20:31.198 --> 00:20:33.858
we can confirm Google Apps
Script versatility,

00:20:33.858 --> 00:20:36.528
because we could integrate
several services

00:20:36.528 --> 00:20:38.627
that Google Apps
are composed of.

00:20:38.627 --> 00:20:41.792
Besides, we could discover
the possibilities

00:20:41.792 --> 00:20:43.825
these services' APIs offer.

00:20:44.594 --> 00:20:46.891
LET'S DO AN EXERCISE

00:20:48.297 --> 00:20:50.660
In order to reinforce
today's lesson,

00:20:50.660 --> 00:20:53.462
I invite you to develop
the following exercise:

00:20:53.462 --> 00:20:55.990
Imagine that,
in your e-mail inbox,

00:20:55.990 --> 00:20:59.429
you have the messages
from a contact form

00:20:59.429 --> 00:21:02.033
and that they need
and automated response.

00:21:02.033 --> 00:21:06.066
So, build a script
that takes the first 7 messages,

00:21:06.627 --> 00:21:09.528
and for all those
that are unread,

00:21:09.528 --> 00:21:11.330
give the following response:

00:21:11.330 --> 00:21:14.891
"Thank you for contacting us.
We're working on your request

00:21:14.891 --> 00:21:18.033
and we will give you a response
as soon as possible."

00:21:18.033 --> 00:21:20.660
We also have to highlight
these e-mails

00:21:20.660 --> 00:21:23.165
and associated to a user tag.

00:21:23.165 --> 00:21:25.297
RECAPITULATION

00:21:26.330 --> 00:21:29.627
In this lesson we worked
with the basic interaction

00:21:29.627 --> 00:21:31.165
of a Google Form.

00:21:31.165 --> 00:21:33.627
We also used
container-bound scripts,

00:21:33.627 --> 00:21:35.462
container extension scripts,

00:21:35.462 --> 00:21:37.561
and the APIs of Gmail,

00:21:37.561 --> 00:21:39.726
Spreadsheet and Document.

00:21:40.264 --> 00:21:43.429
That will be all for now.
See you next time.

00:21:43.429 --> 00:21:44.924
Keep on programming.
