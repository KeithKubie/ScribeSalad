00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.700
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, D.C.

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:23.400
&gt;&gt; Elizabeth Peterson:
Hi there, everyone.

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.320
Welcome. I'm Betsy Peterson,

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:27.540
the Director of the
American Folklife Center here

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:29.140
at the Library of Congress.

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:32.530
And on behalf of the staff and
everyone, I want to welcome you,

00:00:32.530 --> 00:00:35.390
and I also, for the record,
want it to be reflected

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:39.390
that we do have pretty
much a full house,

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:41.560
moving into standing room only.

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:44.960
So, at any rate, today's lecture:

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:49.130
The Botkin series lecture
series is --

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:52.690
it allows the American Folklife
Center to do a couple of things.

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:57.430
It allows us to present the latest
and the very best scholarship

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:02.180
in folklore, ethnomusicology,
oral history, cultural studies,

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:05.460
and it also allows us to
enhance our collections here

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:07.330
at the American Folklife Center.

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:11.910
All of these lectures are recorded,
videotaped, and they become part

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:14.480
of the permanent collections
of the center.

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:19.570
In addition, the lectures are also
posted as webcasts so that people

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:24.270
around the world can hear what
we're talking about and listening

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:28.970
to today, and they will also be
available for generations to come.

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:31.920
So with that said, let me ask
you if you have a cell phone

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:35.970
on right now, please turn it off.

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:37.270
Today, I have the pleasure

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:41.810 position:56%
of introducing folklore's Pravina
Shukla who is an Associate Professor

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:43.190
in the Department of Folklore

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:46.810
and Ethnomusicology
at Indiana University.

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:50.810
Professor Shukla received her B.A.
in Anthropology from the University

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:55.860 position:56%
of California Berkeley, and her M.A.
and Ph.D. in Folklore and Mythology

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:58.810
with a minor in Art
History from the University

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:01.320
of California Los Angeles.

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:05.240
Pravina's research interests are
wide ranging, but she is best known

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:10.010 position:56%
for her studies of material culture,
specifically dress and costume,

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:13.520
folk art, museum studies
and food ways in India,

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:16.390
Brazil and the United States.

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:20.810
She is the author of "The Grace
of Four Moons, Dress, Adornment

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:23.630
and the Art of the
Body in Modern India."

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:27.210
And she is the co-editor of
"The Individual and Tradition,

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:32.630
Folklore's Perspectives," an I.U.
press book published in 2011.

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:35.220
And her work has met with
much critical praise.

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:38.280
She's the winner of the
Milia Davenport Award

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:43.300
of the Costume Society of
America for the best book on dress

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:48.280
and the Coomaraswamy Book Prize of
the Association for Asian Studies

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:52.430
for the best book on India
in the English language.

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:56.820
Her new book, however,
"Costume Performing Identities

00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:58.120
through Dress."

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:01.990
also an I.U. press book
examines how costume functions

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:05.490
to express identity in
situated context full

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:07.330
of intention and meaning.

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:11.700
And let me point out at this moment
that there are copies of the book

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:15.240
out in the lobby, and I
want to encourage all of you

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:21.280
to please stick around, buy a
copy and have the author sign it.

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:23.690
She's currently working
on a new book

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:26.390
on "Sacred Art in Contemporary
Brazil."

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:30.530
So today, Pravina will be
speaking on "Dressing the Past:

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:34.650
Civil War re-enactors,
Williamsburg Historic Interpreters

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:38.320
and Exploring American
Identity Through Costume."

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:40.660
So please join me in
making her welcome.

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:42.460
Dr. Shukla.

00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:50.420
[ Applause ]

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:52.380
&gt;&gt; Pravina Shukla: Before I begin,

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:56.570
there are a few seats,
if you want to sit down.

00:03:56.570 --> 00:03:57.950
No? You want to stand?

00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:00.740
You might be more comfortable
sitting down.

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:06.460
Okay. Let me get situated here.

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:08.040
Can everybody hear me?

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:09.340
Okay. Okay.

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:13.950
The first thing I want to do
before I begin is I want to start

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:19.490
with my gratitude and my thanks
to Betsy Peterson, to John Gold

00:04:19.490 --> 00:04:21.530
and especially to Nancy Groce,
who made -- there she is --

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:24.160
who made this whole
experience really,

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:26.710
really effortless and easy for me.

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:29.340
A look at contemporary
costume re-enactment events

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:33.470 position:56%
in the United States reveals that
there are two key historical periods

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:37.300
that are the most performed
and the most watched.

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:40.700
These two periods in American
history, the Revolution

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:45.580
and the American Civil War are
foci of pride and contention,

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:50.080
subjects for serious scholarship,
for popular fiction and film,

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:53.040
and they serve as inspiration
for costume performance

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:55.340
by thousands of individuals.

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:57.830
National preservation
efforts have maintained

00:04:57.830 --> 00:05:01.200
and sometimes recreated
the sites associated

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:03.550
with these particular
historical periods,

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:07.050
and these become obvious
locales for re-enactment.

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:12.150
Three factors: well preserved
structures and landscape,

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:17.450
accurate looking costumes and
the sincerity of performance lead

00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:20.810
to a moving spectacle
for the audience

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:23.350
and heightened experience
for the actor.

00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:29.190
The realistic looking and sounding
demonstration often has the power

00:05:29.190 --> 00:05:33.920
of transporting you -- you, the
actor and the beholder, to a time

00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:36.950
and place that's being depicted,

00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:40.890
giving what is called a magic
moment experience for both,

00:05:40.890 --> 00:05:45.270
a suspension of the temporal and
opportunity to travel back in time

00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:49.960
to an emotionally charged
moment in the past.

00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:53.130
In 18th century garments
at Colonial Williamsburg

00:05:53.130 --> 00:05:57.460
and in 19th century uniforms
on the Civil War battlefield,

00:05:57.460 --> 00:06:00.550
modern Americans celebrate
the nation's history

00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:03.620
for an amassed crowd of visitors.

00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:07.970 position:56%
Yet, at the same time, the
costumed actors take the opportunity

00:06:07.970 --> 00:06:10.310
to air their own political

00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:14.550
and cultural opinions while
exploring significant aspects

00:06:14.550 --> 00:06:18.090
of their own identities;
giving their own slant

00:06:18.090 --> 00:06:21.400
to a shared historical
understanding.

00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:25.680
The American Revolution celebrates
American freedom from England,

00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:30.550
yet slavery remained a problem
and an institution leading

00:06:30.550 --> 00:06:34.950
to the Civil War in which the
nation is at war with itself.

00:06:34.950 --> 00:06:39.400
How do we understand these
historical periods in terms

00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:46.190 position:56%
of the contemporary concern for
race, gender and political ideology?

00:06:46.190 --> 00:06:49.380
Many people-- costumed
historians of sorts--

00:06:49.380 --> 00:06:51.360
use their own knowledge
and experience

00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:54.950
to explore these questions for
themselves and for the visitors

00:06:54.950 --> 00:06:58.570
that interact with them
at these historic sites.

00:06:58.570 --> 00:07:00.710
By observing and understanding
the interpreters

00:07:00.710 --> 00:07:03.420
at Colonial Williamsburg
Foundation Museum

00:07:03.420 --> 00:07:07.620
and at the Civil War battlefields,
we see that the occasion

00:07:07.620 --> 00:07:10.780
for costume performance
allows these individuals

00:07:10.780 --> 00:07:14.220
to fulfill personal desires
while joining with others

00:07:14.220 --> 00:07:17.940
in collective public celebrations.

00:07:17.940 --> 00:07:22.910
Williamsburg served as a capital
of Colonial Virginia for 81 years

00:07:22.910 --> 00:07:28.020
from 1699 to 1780 when the
capital moved to Richmond.

00:07:28.020 --> 00:07:32.090
In 1926, philanthropist
John D. Rockefeller, Jr.,

00:07:32.090 --> 00:07:34.700
founded the Colonial
Williamsburg Foundation,

00:07:34.700 --> 00:07:37.520
which included an outdoor
museum comprised

00:07:37.520 --> 00:07:43.350
of a 301-acre historic area with
88 original buildings from the 18th

00:07:43.350 --> 00:07:45.750
and early 19th centuries.

00:07:45.750 --> 00:07:48.960
The initial goal was to bring
the town back to "the beauty

00:07:48.960 --> 00:07:52.170
and charm of 200 years ago."

00:07:52.170 --> 00:07:56.340
Rockefeller wanted more than to
restore and preserve the past.

00:07:56.340 --> 00:08:00.980
He wanted to recreate and interpret
colonial life through the museum.

00:08:00.980 --> 00:08:05.170
Scholarly precision and accuracy
were the early goals which led

00:08:05.170 --> 00:08:09.800
to careful architectural
restoration and fabrication based

00:08:09.800 --> 00:08:11.880
on material culture research.

00:08:11.880 --> 00:08:16.470
Accurate buildings become a natural
backdrop for costumed interpreters.

00:08:16.470 --> 00:08:21.240
The museum started dressing
people in period clothing in 1934.

00:08:21.240 --> 00:08:24.360
The first six people to be
costumed were female docents

00:08:24.360 --> 00:08:28.540
in the Raleigh tavern, which led
to fine reproductions to be worn

00:08:28.540 --> 00:08:34.270
by the hostess interpreters at the
tavern and the governor's palace.

00:08:34.270 --> 00:08:37.020 position:56%
Brenda Rasso [assumed spelling],
the person in charge of the costume,

00:08:37.020 --> 00:08:40.140
said that Colonial
Williamsburg at this time was

00:08:40.140 --> 00:08:42.150
"a colonial revival town.

00:08:42.150 --> 00:08:44.940
There was this romantic
idea of old Virginia."

00:08:44.940 --> 00:08:51.020
In the 1970s, at the time of
the Bicentennial with the rise

00:08:51.020 --> 00:08:55.080
of the serious study of American
material culture and the stress

00:08:55.080 --> 00:08:59.730 position:56%
on the Foundation's new curriculum
on inclusiveness and social history,

00:08:59.730 --> 00:09:03.680 position:56%
the costumes started becoming
better researched and more accurate.

00:09:03.680 --> 00:09:06.010
Today, the Costume
Design Center creates

00:09:06.010 --> 00:09:08.010
and maintains accurate costumes

00:09:08.010 --> 00:09:11.610
for all the employees
of the historic area.

00:09:11.610 --> 00:09:16.330
59,000 articles of clothing
are owned by the Foundation.

00:09:16.330 --> 00:09:20.790
They are made, altered,
stored, cleaned and tracked

00:09:20.790 --> 00:09:25.160
for 834 people in 1500 positions.

00:09:25.160 --> 00:09:31.770
They wear clothing of the period
between 1769 and 1781 with 1774

00:09:31.770 --> 00:09:34.180
as a base interpretive year.

00:09:34.180 --> 00:09:38.430
The accuracy of costumes
frees the wear to embody

00:09:38.430 --> 00:09:40.110
and communicate their version

00:09:40.110 --> 00:09:44.120
of their persona's role
in the 18th century.

00:09:44.120 --> 00:09:46.160
Through interpretation, one is able

00:09:46.160 --> 00:09:51.700
to express deeply held
personal values.

00:09:51.700 --> 00:09:55.290
Colonial Williamsburg allows for
the expression of multiple messages

00:09:55.290 --> 00:09:58.880
that are embedded in his
overarching educational mission.

00:09:58.880 --> 00:10:00.230
Costume interpreters are able

00:10:00.230 --> 00:10:02.760
to personalize the
message while staying

00:10:02.760 --> 00:10:05.370
within the frame of the Foundation.

00:10:05.370 --> 00:10:09.380
The Foundation six areas
for emphasis for accuracy

00:10:09.380 --> 00:10:13.640
in education are architecture,
gardens, archeology,

00:10:13.640 --> 00:10:17.110
decorative arts, history
and the historic trades,

00:10:17.110 --> 00:10:20.630
which include carpenters,
blacksmiths, shoemakers,

00:10:20.630 --> 00:10:24.750
basket makers, tailors
and dress makers.

00:10:24.750 --> 00:10:29.410 position:56%
The historic trades allow the museum
to present the cultures, lifestyle

00:10:29.410 --> 00:10:34.840
and values of ordinary people by
what they wear and what they make.

00:10:34.840 --> 00:10:40.550
This is a result of the
museum's embrace in the 1980s

00:10:40.550 --> 00:10:42.940
of the new social history,
often referred

00:10:42.940 --> 00:10:45.870
to as "every man's history."

00:10:45.870 --> 00:10:48.760
Now the emphasis has
shifted to the colonial --

00:10:48.760 --> 00:10:53.310
from the colonial period to a
more patriotic and specific theme,

00:10:53.310 --> 00:10:57.440
which is America on the
eve of the Revolution.

00:10:57.440 --> 00:11:01.260
In the 2000s, the museum launched
a street theater program called

00:11:01.260 --> 00:11:03.450
Revolutionary City.

00:11:03.450 --> 00:11:08.550
The story of the capital is now
told through important residents,

00:11:08.550 --> 00:11:13.400
the nation builders, the highly
identifiable persons of history --

00:11:13.400 --> 00:11:17.520
and these are George Washington,
on the screen right now,

00:11:17.520 --> 00:11:21.210
Martha Washington, Thomas
Jefferson, the Marquis de Lafayette

00:11:21.210 --> 00:11:23.910
and Patrick Henry, among others.

00:11:23.910 --> 00:11:29.760
The shift from every man to famous
man underscores a general American

00:11:29.760 --> 00:11:33.540 position:56%
tendency to tell history through the
lives of extraordinary individuals.

00:11:33.540 --> 00:11:39.270
The Marquis de Lafayette,
for example.

00:11:39.270 --> 00:11:44.520
Some nation builders are well known
characters such as Patrick Henry.

00:11:46.600 --> 00:11:52.800
Gowan Pamphlet, the Baptist slave
preacher, is also a nation builder.

00:11:52.800 --> 00:11:56.010
The horrifying history of
slavery presents a challenge

00:11:56.010 --> 00:11:59.690
that cannot be met in a
museum of living history.

00:11:59.690 --> 00:12:03.160
By designating Gowan
Pamphlet a nation builder,

00:12:03.160 --> 00:12:06.400
the museum brings a topic
of slavery to the forefront

00:12:06.400 --> 00:12:09.750
of its educational agenda.

00:12:09.750 --> 00:12:11.050
Gowan Pamphlet is portrayed

00:12:11.050 --> 00:12:14.690
by the charismatic actor
interpreter James Ingram.

00:12:14.690 --> 00:12:19.990
James has been re-enacting the
character for over 20 years.

00:12:19.990 --> 00:12:23.920
James taught me that Gowan Pamphlet
was an extraordinary individual.

00:12:23.920 --> 00:12:27.600
He was literate at a time when
only 20 percent of the population

00:12:27.600 --> 00:12:30.170
of Virginia could read and right.

00:12:30.170 --> 00:12:33.940
He secretly ministered the new
religion to his fellow slaves,

00:12:33.940 --> 00:12:37.350 position:56%
and eventually received his freedom,
founding what was later known

00:12:37.350 --> 00:12:41.160
as the First Baptist
Church of Williamsburg.

00:12:41.160 --> 00:12:45.000
A nuanced understanding of slavery
can be gleaned from interacting

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:48.350
with James in his role
as Gowan Pamphlet.

00:12:48.350 --> 00:12:52.950
For he is articulate, educated,
well-dressed-a disruption

00:12:52.950 --> 00:12:56.330
to the stereotype of a
slave in tattered clothes

00:12:56.330 --> 00:12:59.140
and ungrammatical speech.

00:12:59.140 --> 00:13:02.280
James told me that as an African
American man he finds it important

00:13:02.280 --> 00:13:05.560
to portray Gowan Pamphlet
in Williamsburg.

00:13:05.560 --> 00:13:09.300
"Telling the story of
enslaved people allows me

00:13:09.300 --> 00:13:14.450
to not only tell the story of my
own past, but a story of America.

00:13:14.450 --> 00:13:18.260
It's also giving a voice to
those that didn't have a voice.

00:13:18.260 --> 00:13:20.220
We have a real high mission here.

00:13:20.220 --> 00:13:22.000
This mission to tell this story

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:25.440
because it wasn't a story
they were able to tell.

00:13:25.440 --> 00:13:28.470
Many of these people did
not have an opportunity

00:13:28.470 --> 00:13:30.880
to write their story down.

00:13:30.880 --> 00:13:34.480
And so uniquely through what I do
every single day, I'm honoring them

00:13:34.480 --> 00:13:37.860
that have gone before me
for those that are here,

00:13:37.860 --> 00:13:39.580
but mainly for the future.

00:13:39.580 --> 00:13:41.240
It's the children.

00:13:41.240 --> 00:13:43.610
The children are my
mission here because many

00:13:43.610 --> 00:13:48.000 position:56%
of them don't know their history and
really doesn't matter, black, white,

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:49.860
doesn't matter your color.

00:13:49.860 --> 00:13:51.500
They don't know the
history of America

00:13:51.500 --> 00:13:54.720
and how they fit in that puzzle.

00:13:54.720 --> 00:13:59.280
And so it's my duty and mission
every single day to get up,

00:13:59.280 --> 00:14:01.500
to go out, to prove to people

00:14:01.500 --> 00:14:06.470
that this story was part
of the American story."

00:14:06.470 --> 00:14:10.820
James' educational mission is to
teach about the complex, nuanced

00:14:10.820 --> 00:14:15.250 position:56%
and troubling institution of slavery
by considering the environmental,

00:14:15.250 --> 00:14:18.110
emotional, social and
economic factors

00:14:18.110 --> 00:14:21.130
that varied from time and place.

00:14:21.130 --> 00:14:24.960
For example, the tobacco country
of Virginia in the 18th century

00:14:24.960 --> 00:14:28.820
versus a cotton plantation in the
deep South in the 19th century--

00:14:28.820 --> 00:14:30.490
what most people think
of when they think

00:14:30.490 --> 00:14:33.210
of slavery in the United States.

00:14:33.210 --> 00:14:38.210
The current emphasis on America on
the eve of the Revolution leaves

00:14:38.210 --> 00:14:43.250
out the culture, lifestyle
and values of ordinary people.

00:14:44.430 --> 00:14:47.890
Within this educational
mission, individuals compensate

00:14:47.890 --> 00:14:52.060
by emphasizing those people
less-celebrated including the poor

00:14:52.060 --> 00:14:54.390
people and women.

00:14:54.390 --> 00:14:57.010
During the first 50 years
of Colonial Williamsburg,

00:14:57.010 --> 00:15:01.860
the common people served as context
for the extraordinary citizens,

00:15:01.860 --> 00:15:06.630
the nation builders who Rockefeller
called the great patriots.

00:15:06.630 --> 00:15:09.610
The costume focus has always
been on the beautiful gowns

00:15:09.610 --> 00:15:12.410
and the fine military uniforms.

00:15:12.410 --> 00:15:16.500
The story of working people is
generally lost from history books

00:15:16.500 --> 00:15:19.450
and is usually missing
from living history events

00:15:19.450 --> 00:15:22.140
as well including here.

00:15:22.140 --> 00:15:24.800
Basket maker, Terry Fong
[assumed spelling], among others,

00:15:24.800 --> 00:15:28.830
sees it as her mission to fill
the gap of historical knowledge

00:15:28.830 --> 00:15:31.860
by interpreting the life
of the "lower sort people

00:15:31.860 --> 00:15:34.160
at Colonial Williamsburg."

00:15:35.450 --> 00:15:38.410
Terry has worked at Colonial
Williamsburg for over 25 years,

00:15:38.410 --> 00:15:42.060
and she was the first female
coachman at the museum.

00:15:42.060 --> 00:15:44.650
She told me she likes talking
about the baskets as a way

00:15:44.650 --> 00:15:47.520
to open the topic of social
class because the people

00:15:47.520 --> 00:15:50.660
who make baskets were
generally poor.

00:15:50.660 --> 00:15:53.540
Terry sees her costume as
providing an opportunity

00:15:53.540 --> 00:15:58.120
to discuss social class, as a door
to many things but also has a prop

00:15:58.120 --> 00:16:01.460
for the visitor since
visitors are often at a loss

00:16:01.460 --> 00:16:05.870
for appropriate topics to engage a
costume's interpreter and questions

00:16:05.870 --> 00:16:10.760
about what they are wearing
become an obvious entry point.

00:16:10.760 --> 00:16:15.090
Terry told me, "It's a great
educational opportunity to be able

00:16:15.090 --> 00:16:18.370
to talk with people about
why I'm wearing what I am."

00:16:18.370 --> 00:16:21.660
(Sorry, I have this habit.

00:16:21.660 --> 00:16:25.140
I have to put my hair up
because it bothers me.)

00:16:25.140 --> 00:16:27.950
"I prefer to talk about
the lower sort people

00:16:27.950 --> 00:16:31.210
because I really think they
get a short shrift here.

00:16:31.210 --> 00:16:33.090
Everyone likes the beautiful gowns,

00:16:33.090 --> 00:16:35.420
and I really like the
working clothes.

00:16:35.420 --> 00:16:39.110
They're extremely comfortable and
even in hot weather, they are nice.

00:16:39.110 --> 00:16:41.400
People are very curious about them.

00:16:41.400 --> 00:16:44.670
It opens up an opportunity to
talk to people about the costumes

00:16:44.670 --> 00:16:47.220
and about my faith in history here.

00:16:47.220 --> 00:16:50.140
How many people actually wore
these as opposed to the silks

00:16:50.140 --> 00:16:52.710
and satins and the beautiful gowns?

00:16:52.710 --> 00:16:55.430
I just think it's very important
to let people know that many

00:16:55.430 --> 00:16:58.860
of our people are the
poorest just like today.

00:16:58.860 --> 00:17:02.320
Not everyone has a lot of money."

00:17:02.320 --> 00:17:04.940
Terry's educational
mission is admirable,

00:17:04.940 --> 00:17:07.780
for she has a personal
interest in emphasizing

00:17:07.780 --> 00:17:11.190
and expanding the mainstream story.

00:17:11.190 --> 00:17:14.180
Once a male visitor asked her,

00:17:14.180 --> 00:17:17.200
"Don't you feel ridiculous
wearing those clothes?"

00:17:17.200 --> 00:17:21.310
Recounting the incident, Terry
told me that she told the man, "No.

00:17:21.310 --> 00:17:24.520
Not at all, because
this is my history.

00:17:24.520 --> 00:17:28.520
I'm very proud to wear -- to
be wearing part of my history,

00:17:28.520 --> 00:17:31.000
and I can tell you right
now, my people were poor.

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:33.840
I'm wearing exactly what
they would be wearing."

00:17:33.840 --> 00:17:35.140
Terry is from Virginia.

00:17:35.140 --> 00:17:37.750
Her mother's family goes
back to the 18th century.

00:17:37.750 --> 00:17:42.650
She is literally representing a
part of her own personal history.

00:17:42.650 --> 00:17:45.830
Sarah Woodyard [assumed spelling]
is a stylish apprentice dress maker

00:17:45.830 --> 00:17:49.920
at the Marvin Hunter Shop on
the Duke of Glouster Street.

00:17:49.920 --> 00:17:52.590
Her personal mission is to
educate the museum guests

00:17:52.590 --> 00:17:56.200
about women's history, adding
another conceptual layer

00:17:56.200 --> 00:17:59.080
to the need of inclusiveness.

00:17:59.080 --> 00:18:03.470
Sarah describes the lives of 18th
century women while Terry tells

00:18:03.470 --> 00:18:05.900
of the local poor and
James discusses the plight

00:18:05.900 --> 00:18:08.930
of African Americans at the time.

00:18:08.930 --> 00:18:14.420
All this enlarges a flashy story of
the prominent men and a few women

00:18:14.420 --> 00:18:18.000
who shaped America on the
eve of the Revolution.

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:20.690
At Colonial Williamsburg,
guests learn about history

00:18:20.690 --> 00:18:24.100
through the interpretation
of the costume staff.

00:18:24.100 --> 00:18:27.080
But the employees of the
historic trades also learn

00:18:27.080 --> 00:18:30.500
through direct engagement
with historic objects

00:18:30.500 --> 00:18:36.050
and replicas using period and
reproduced tools and techniques.

00:18:36.050 --> 00:18:40.040
Sarah Woodyard studied garment
construction, women studies

00:18:40.040 --> 00:18:43.430
and economic history at
Ohio State University.

00:18:43.430 --> 00:18:45.690
She has, however, learned
much by wearing

00:18:45.690 --> 00:18:49.430
and making 18th century
women's clothing.

00:18:49.430 --> 00:18:54.080
For example, many visitors wonder
about the stays, the corsets,

00:18:54.080 --> 00:18:57.400
which women of the period wore, and
that undergarment provides a way

00:18:57.400 --> 00:19:01.710
for Sarah to discuss 18th
century women's bodies.

00:19:01.710 --> 00:19:05.260
Sarah said, "A lot of
people seem to see this

00:19:05.260 --> 00:19:10.100
as this constricting antifeminist
garment that was restricting women,

00:19:10.100 --> 00:19:13.170
but when you wear it,
it becomes part of you.

00:19:13.170 --> 00:19:14.990
And you don't notice
that you're wearing it.

00:19:14.990 --> 00:19:16.500
I mean, you do to some degree

00:19:16.500 --> 00:19:19.640
because it keeps you
upright, and they support you.

00:19:19.640 --> 00:19:22.210
But I don't feel like somebody's
holding me down, I guess.

00:19:22.210 --> 00:19:24.560
I feel like it's a
practical thing to be wearing.

00:19:24.560 --> 00:19:26.990
It's what you got."

00:19:26.990 --> 00:19:31.710
Sarah, a student of 19th century
clothing and labor history,

00:19:31.710 --> 00:19:34.150
came to Colonial Williamsburg
with an open mind

00:19:34.150 --> 00:19:37.320
about wearing stays and petticoats.

00:19:37.320 --> 00:19:39.300
With an interest in
recent approaches

00:19:39.300 --> 00:19:43.910
to material culture study, costume
history and women's history,

00:19:43.910 --> 00:19:49.500
she's "interested in history
first, feminism second."

00:19:49.500 --> 00:19:52.610
Sarah believes that many
visitors view 18th century women

00:19:52.610 --> 00:19:54.690
through 21st century eyes,

00:19:54.690 --> 00:19:58.350
projecting contemporary
understanding of gender politics

00:19:58.350 --> 00:20:00.570
onto the people of the past.

00:20:00.570 --> 00:20:07.570
Sarah said, "I don't want to impose
1970s feminism on the 18th century.

00:20:07.570 --> 00:20:10.650
I don't think that history
is progressive by any means,

00:20:10.650 --> 00:20:12.780
and that's something
that is fascinating to me

00:20:12.780 --> 00:20:16.890
because people think that women
had no rights in the 18th century,

00:20:16.890 --> 00:20:19.870 position:56%
and they certainly had rights then."

00:20:19.870 --> 00:20:24.160 position:56%
Women had rights, and they
embraced, they enhanced their social

00:20:24.160 --> 00:20:28.690
and economic status by working
as dress makers and milliners.

00:20:28.690 --> 00:20:31.850
Sarah explained the 18th
century preindustrial area,

00:20:31.850 --> 00:20:36.180
gown making was a hired skill
because it was an apprentice trade,

00:20:36.180 --> 00:20:40.620
yet sometimes history would degrade
the work of women in the home.

00:20:40.620 --> 00:20:43.890
In the 18th century, women
are working in the home,

00:20:43.890 --> 00:20:46.320
but they're getting paid for
their work and contributing

00:20:46.320 --> 00:20:51.350
to the household income while
fulfilling domestic duties.

00:20:51.350 --> 00:20:56.190 position:56%
At Colonial Williamsburg, as we have
seen, costume interpreters strive

00:20:56.190 --> 00:20:59.690
to broaden the historical
knowledge of the visitor by filling

00:20:59.690 --> 00:21:02.700
in the gaps created by
conventional history.

00:21:02.700 --> 00:21:07.130
Namely the gaps of race, social
economic class and gender.

00:21:07.130 --> 00:21:09.510
The story of the affluent
and influential men

00:21:09.510 --> 00:21:15.890 position:56%
of American history gets enhanced by
adding the voices and costume bodies

00:21:15.890 --> 00:21:20.540
of African Americans, women
and the working class.

00:21:20.540 --> 00:21:23.540
The institution of Colonial
Williamsburg has established a

00:21:23.540 --> 00:21:28.070
pedagogical framework, yet the
interpreter sees the opportunity

00:21:28.070 --> 00:21:31.200
to adjust and fine tune
the foundation's agenda

00:21:31.200 --> 00:21:34.210
to reflect their own concerns.

00:21:34.210 --> 00:21:37.530
Colonial Williamsburg
historian Carrie Carson, says,

00:21:37.530 --> 00:21:40.120
"The museum is a classroom.

00:21:40.120 --> 00:21:43.810
The staff members are team
teachers, and the interpreters,

00:21:43.810 --> 00:21:47.060
in turn, are little professors."

00:21:47.060 --> 00:21:49.520
Through interviews and
first hand observation,

00:21:49.520 --> 00:21:53.960
ethnographic field work, we see
how interpreters, nation builders

00:21:53.960 --> 00:21:57.300
and those in the historic
trades connect with the visitors

00:21:57.300 --> 00:22:02.410
and teach history by utilizing
their own knowledge and experience,

00:22:02.410 --> 00:22:06.970 position:56%
delivering lessons that derive from
a personally constructed curriculum,

00:22:06.970 --> 00:22:10.000
talk to one million
visitors that pass

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:13.500
through Colonial Williamsburg
every single year.

00:22:13.500 --> 00:22:16.090
On the screen is Taylor Marcutter
[assumed spelling] addressing a

00:22:16.090 --> 00:22:18.740
group of school kids.

00:22:18.740 --> 00:22:23.110
One mythic national moment of
origin is the American Revolution.

00:22:23.110 --> 00:22:25.810
Another is the Civil War,
a period of four years

00:22:25.810 --> 00:22:29.500
when the country fractured
and mended again.

00:22:29.500 --> 00:22:34.950
Over 50,000 men, people,
mostly men re-enact the events

00:22:34.950 --> 00:22:39.110
of the American Civil War in
locations across the country.

00:22:39.110 --> 00:22:43.450
Some camp, drill and fight
as a common soldier would.

00:22:43.450 --> 00:22:46.020
Others assume the persona
of a famous general

00:22:46.020 --> 00:22:48.310
and address the visitors.

00:22:48.310 --> 00:22:52.300
The impetus for preservation
of history of the battlefields

00:22:52.300 --> 00:22:55.290
and of significant
architectural structures

00:22:55.290 --> 00:22:58.100
such as the Liberia Plantation
in Manassas, Virginia--

00:22:58.100 --> 00:23:03.030
on the screen right now -- once
again leads to re-enactment.

00:23:04.580 --> 00:23:08.900
The conserved locale becomes a
backdrop for theatrical action,

00:23:08.900 --> 00:23:15.280
for the performance of history,
identity and political ideology.

00:23:15.280 --> 00:23:17.510
The re-enactments take place near,

00:23:17.510 --> 00:23:21.060
but not on the actual
preserved battlefields,

00:23:21.060 --> 00:23:24.310
but they often occur during
the anniversary of the battles,

00:23:24.310 --> 00:23:27.820
allowing the costume soldier
to experience the terrain,

00:23:27.820 --> 00:23:31.260
the actual weather of
the site 150 years ago.

00:23:31.260 --> 00:23:34.640
Male comradery, sociability

00:23:34.640 --> 00:23:38.370
and personal pleasure are among
the reasons why these men spend

00:23:38.370 --> 00:23:42.720
thousands of dollars and hundreds
of hours in hot wool uniforms

00:23:42.720 --> 00:23:46.410
on the battlefields portraying
the men who fought and died

00:23:46.410 --> 00:23:48.760
in the American Civil War.

00:23:48.760 --> 00:23:52.730 position:56%
Some such as John Slaughter, for
example, have always had an interest

00:23:52.730 --> 00:23:58.490
in history and this hobby allows
for a continuous self-education.

00:23:58.490 --> 00:24:04.100
Others, such as Jay Vogle, enjoy
the time with fellow veterans,

00:24:04.100 --> 00:24:07.800
tapping into a shared
military experience.

00:24:07.800 --> 00:24:10.240
For re-enactors who
are military veterans,

00:24:10.240 --> 00:24:14.540
the journey through history to a
war of the past can return them

00:24:14.540 --> 00:24:18.230
to their own combat experience.

00:24:18.230 --> 00:24:21.040
Jay Vogle said that
with special permission

00:24:21.040 --> 00:24:25.710
from the National Military Park
he and others have been able

00:24:25.710 --> 00:24:30.890
to retrace the steps of Pickett's
charge on July 3 on the anniversary

00:24:30.890 --> 00:24:33.960
of the famous confederate
march that led

00:24:33.960 --> 00:24:39.460
to over 10,000 Civil War
soldiers to be killed or wounded.

00:24:40.520 --> 00:24:44.780
Jay told me, "Once we
cross Emerson's Pike,

00:24:44.780 --> 00:24:47.670
we know what's happening
to the men at this time.

00:24:47.670 --> 00:24:51.300
They're starting to come
under heavy musketry fire.

00:24:51.300 --> 00:24:54.050
The group gets quiet as
they walk somber in light

00:24:54.050 --> 00:24:56.960
of the real lives that
were lost here.

00:24:56.960 --> 00:25:00.620
As we cross, there's a
total release of emotion."

00:25:00.620 --> 00:25:04.780
During the charge, Jay uses
his own history to connect

00:25:04.780 --> 00:25:07.910
to his own experiences,
channeling the feelings

00:25:07.910 --> 00:25:09.460
of those doomed soldiers.

00:25:09.460 --> 00:25:14.670
"For me, it brings back memories
of my past in the military.

00:25:14.670 --> 00:25:18.210
That's when I truly
understand what's going on."

00:25:19.320 --> 00:25:22.030
He told me that when he
was in the Marine Corps,

00:25:22.030 --> 00:25:24.680
he lost four friends in Beirut.

00:25:24.680 --> 00:25:28.560
And he's reminded of that
time during re-enactment.

00:25:29.840 --> 00:25:32.080
Pickett's Charge carries
extra emotion

00:25:32.080 --> 00:25:34.290
when Jay recalls his own losses,

00:25:34.290 --> 00:25:37.220
and he limits how often
he seeks the experience.

00:25:37.220 --> 00:25:40.900
"I can only handle
doing this so often.

00:25:40.900 --> 00:25:44.630
It's -- I do it about
once every two years now.

00:25:44.630 --> 00:25:47.250
If I need it more emotionally,
I would.

00:25:47.250 --> 00:25:49.370
I probably couldn't handle it.

00:25:49.370 --> 00:25:51.530
It's emotionally draining."

00:25:51.530 --> 00:25:55.610
Re-enacting the Civil War connects
Jay to his own military past

00:25:55.610 --> 00:25:57.810
and that of his ancestors
as he told me.

00:25:57.810 --> 00:26:01.880
"I had relatives who fought
on both sides of the war.

00:26:01.880 --> 00:26:04.490
Both got wounded in the Peach
Orchard on the same day.

00:26:04.490 --> 00:26:09.470
It ties me back to
my family, my past."

00:26:09.470 --> 00:26:13.030
For many men, being a
Civil War soldier is a way

00:26:13.030 --> 00:26:16.070
to express regional identity.

00:26:16.070 --> 00:26:19.170 position:56%
Mark LaPoint [assumed spelling]
re-enacts with a 28th Massachusetts,

00:26:19.170 --> 00:26:21.710
and we have a member of the 28th
Massachusetts in the audience

00:26:21.710 --> 00:26:25.350
so this was recorded forever.

00:26:25.350 --> 00:26:26.910
He is from Massachusetts.

00:26:26.910 --> 00:26:30.230
Re-enacting a union soldier
is partly about connecting

00:26:30.230 --> 00:26:32.800
to his regional identity.

00:26:32.800 --> 00:26:35.310
Mark says, "I'm from the north.

00:26:35.310 --> 00:26:36.620
That's where I grew up.

00:26:36.620 --> 00:26:40.310
I can relate to the history that
people that lived there at the time

00:26:40.310 --> 00:26:42.390 position:56%
and I can get to know their stories.

00:26:42.390 --> 00:26:44.750
My heritage is northern."

00:26:44.750 --> 00:26:47.580
He continued.

00:26:47.580 --> 00:26:51.130
"I'm a huge Abraham Lincoln fan so
I think it would be a disservice

00:26:51.130 --> 00:26:54.440
to his memory to fight
for the Confederacy.

00:26:54.440 --> 00:26:57.620
I don't believe or
condone slavery in any way,

00:26:57.620 --> 00:27:00.080
and I hope that if I were
alive during that period,

00:27:00.080 --> 00:27:03.470
I would feel the same way."

00:27:03.470 --> 00:27:07.870
Mark Sloan is also a northerner
from Pennsylvania, but he chooses

00:27:07.870 --> 00:27:10.890
to re-enact as a Confederate
soldier.

00:27:10.890 --> 00:27:16.060
For he feels himself to
be "southern at heart."

00:27:16.060 --> 00:27:21.470
He is here second from right with
the 21st Georgia in Manassas made

00:27:21.470 --> 00:27:26.830
of mostly from men from New York.

00:27:26.830 --> 00:27:30.010
Mark read veraciously about the
Civil War, and the more he read,

00:27:30.010 --> 00:27:33.720
the more he was drawn to the
southern side he told me.

00:27:33.720 --> 00:27:39.260 position:56%
Mark said, "In most cases, the
south was vastly outnumbered in men,

00:27:39.260 --> 00:27:43.600
arms and supplies, yet being
led by General Lee, Jackson,

00:27:43.600 --> 00:27:45.980
Hood and Longstreet and others,

00:27:45.980 --> 00:27:49.680
the Army of Northern Virginia
won battle after battle.

00:27:49.680 --> 00:27:52.060
So the south went into
the battles as underdogs.

00:27:52.060 --> 00:27:55.170
Not a chance in hell of
pulling off a victory.

00:27:55.170 --> 00:27:57.270
Yet they came out victorious.

00:27:57.270 --> 00:28:00.730
So that's what draws my
inner being to the south."

00:28:00.730 --> 00:28:04.190
He continued, "So many
southern units are portrayed

00:28:04.190 --> 00:28:06.720
by guys who live in the north.

00:28:06.720 --> 00:28:09.710
On the other hand, you
will find very few guys

00:28:09.710 --> 00:28:12.510
from the south portraying
a Union soldier.

00:28:12.510 --> 00:28:16.510
They usually will not -- they
usually would dress Confederate.

00:28:16.510 --> 00:28:20.390
Still a lot of ill feeling about
the war even though it was 150

00:28:20.390 --> 00:28:21.690
years ago."

00:28:21.690 --> 00:28:27.600
Re-enacting as a private allows

00:28:27.600 --> 00:28:31.860
for personal communication
among your fellow soldiers.

00:28:31.860 --> 00:28:34.380
On the other hand, many
people choose the role

00:28:34.380 --> 00:28:38.450
of a living historian
engaging in active education

00:28:38.450 --> 00:28:43.380 position:56%
and direct communication with the
public, explaining life in the 1860s

00:28:43.380 --> 00:28:47.530 position:56%
and also describing and interpreting
the tactics and strategies

00:28:47.530 --> 00:28:50.120
of the generals they portray.

00:28:50.120 --> 00:28:52.520
You're looking at Dwight Hensley

00:28:52.520 --> 00:28:56.750
as Confederate Major
General Richard Garnett.

00:28:56.750 --> 00:29:00.050
These re-enactors are closer
to the actor interpreter

00:29:00.050 --> 00:29:02.330
than Colonial Williamsburg
and their ability

00:29:02.330 --> 00:29:05.020
to address a crowd of visitors.

00:29:05.020 --> 00:29:07.360
Mike Sites [assumed
spelling] is from Maryland.

00:29:07.360 --> 00:29:09.940
His research revealed
that an ancestor fought

00:29:09.940 --> 00:29:13.480
in the Confederate
Second Maryland Battalion.

00:29:13.480 --> 00:29:15.100
So Mike found a unit in Baltimore

00:29:15.100 --> 00:29:17.940
that portrayed the Second
Maryland Calvary Dismounted,

00:29:17.940 --> 00:29:21.570
and he joined "to honor
my ancestors' history."

00:29:21.570 --> 00:29:26.160 position:56%
He later started portraying
confederate Lieutenant General Jubal

00:29:26.160 --> 00:29:28.950
Early-- on the screen right now.

00:29:28.950 --> 00:29:32.860
He told me that portraying
General Early is his calling.

00:29:32.860 --> 00:29:36.080
He believed he was on a mission.

00:29:36.080 --> 00:29:40.110
He gave up re-enacting with the
Second Maryland because, "Really,

00:29:40.110 --> 00:29:41.560
I don't want to be out there.

00:29:41.560 --> 00:29:46.230
I want to be here, here among the
generals who are living historians,

00:29:46.230 --> 00:29:49.130
not out there among the
privates in battle."

00:29:49.130 --> 00:29:54.030
For Mike, the Civil War provides
a way to connect to his ancestors

00:29:54.030 --> 00:29:57.050
and through his interpreting
personation of a general to act

00:29:57.050 --> 00:30:01.190
on personal political ideology.

00:30:01.190 --> 00:30:06.010
This is in fact the driving force
for many Civil War re-enactors.

00:30:06.010 --> 00:30:09.320
To use history as a way to
critique what they perceive

00:30:09.320 --> 00:30:10.930
to be a growing power

00:30:10.930 --> 00:30:13.540
of an expanding general
of central government.

00:30:13.540 --> 00:30:18.260
It is one reason to don the
authentic uniform as Mike says,

00:30:18.260 --> 00:30:22.050
"When people come up
to me and they say why?

00:30:22.050 --> 00:30:26.910
How do you put on a wool uniform,
stand in 95 degree weather?

00:30:26.910 --> 00:30:29.050
I go, this is why.

00:30:29.050 --> 00:30:33.720
History needs to be taught."

00:30:33.720 --> 00:30:39.000
Niles Clark also uses his
platform to write history.

00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:42.770
Niles is from Indiana,
though I met him in Virginia.

00:30:42.770 --> 00:30:46.050
He portrays Major General
George E. Pickett,

00:30:46.050 --> 00:30:49.950
the flamboyant Virginia officer,
and he is in fact endorsed

00:30:49.950 --> 00:30:53.490
by the George Pickett
Society and makes appearances

00:30:53.490 --> 00:30:55.770
at the general's gravesite
in commemoration

00:30:55.770 --> 00:30:58.750
of the anniversary of his death.

00:30:58.750 --> 00:31:02.240
Niles sees his mission as
educating those around him.

00:31:02.240 --> 00:31:04.220
"See this truth out there.

00:31:04.220 --> 00:31:05.520
People will look for them,

00:31:05.520 --> 00:31:07.410
and that's the main thing
about learning anything.

00:31:07.410 --> 00:31:09.830
You've got to look for the truth.

00:31:09.830 --> 00:31:11.630
You can't just take
what someone has written

00:31:11.630 --> 00:31:13.310
or put in a movie for granted.

00:31:13.310 --> 00:31:16.480
We search, and I read."

00:31:16.480 --> 00:31:19.690
Wear the uniform of Major
General Pickett, he tells,

00:31:19.690 --> 00:31:24.380
"The southern side of the story
in his northern state of Indiana"

00:31:24.380 --> 00:31:27.450
to "fix what they're
learning wrong."

00:31:27.450 --> 00:31:34.670
Niles Clark among others dressed
as a Confederate general and argues

00:31:34.670 --> 00:31:37.290
that the federal government
were taking away state's rights

00:31:37.290 --> 00:31:39.910
that the Constitution granted.

00:31:39.910 --> 00:31:42.170
So Lincoln's actions
were in violation

00:31:42.170 --> 00:31:46.070
of what the Constitution
guaranteed to each state.

00:31:46.070 --> 00:31:51.610
Niles told me, "We can even
look at the powers that be now.

00:31:51.610 --> 00:31:53.940
They're trying to undermine
the constitution.

00:31:53.940 --> 00:31:55.610
It's our rights being taken away,

00:31:55.610 --> 00:32:00.000
and that's not what we
formed this country for."

00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:03.140
Wearing uniforms of the Civil
War era and talking to visitors

00:32:03.140 --> 00:32:07.780
about the 19th century is a way to
comment on the current situation.

00:32:07.780 --> 00:32:12.850 position:56%
Contemporary men from northern
states dress as Confederate generals

00:32:12.850 --> 00:32:17.960
and pass judgments on the Obama
administration while ostensibly

00:32:17.960 --> 00:32:22.080
speaking about President
Abraham Lincoln's presidency.

00:32:22.080 --> 00:32:28.060
But for some the responsibility
of dressing as a general is

00:32:28.060 --> 00:32:33.330
to keep personal opinion out of the
portrayal of historical figures.

00:32:33.330 --> 00:32:35.660
Jim Optenager [assumed spelling]
is an artist from Pennsylvania,

00:32:35.660 --> 00:32:39.270
and he portrays union general
William Tecumseh Sherman

00:32:39.270 --> 00:32:42.870
and he often re-enacts
with his family.

00:32:42.870 --> 00:32:45.320
He believes that the living
historian should not use a

00:32:45.320 --> 00:32:48.770
historical persona to further
his own political agenda.

00:32:48.770 --> 00:32:51.670
He told me, "I've always
had an issue with this

00:32:51.670 --> 00:32:54.450
because I'm listening
to you not the general,

00:32:54.450 --> 00:32:57.120
and it's hard to separate the
two because you don't know one,

00:32:57.120 --> 00:32:59.930
and you're trying to do
one through the other

00:32:59.930 --> 00:33:01.900
and that's a problem I have here.

00:33:01.900 --> 00:33:06.100
But to push any kind of
agenda, I think, is wrong."

00:33:06.100 --> 00:33:09.900
The teacher at the Civil War
site, Jim told me should not argue

00:33:09.900 --> 00:33:14.200 position:56%
from 21st century attitudes
because no matter how much you study

00:33:14.200 --> 00:33:17.440
"you will never know
how they truly felt.

00:33:17.440 --> 00:33:20.360
You'll never know deep inside."

00:33:20.360 --> 00:33:23.940
You can gather facts but ultimately
you're interpreting the actions

00:33:23.940 --> 00:33:26.620
of someone else.

00:33:28.650 --> 00:33:31.010
Jim speaks both in the third person

00:33:31.010 --> 00:33:34.590
and in the first person
speaking as General Sherman.

00:33:34.590 --> 00:33:37.280
He told me, "You say his name now,

00:33:37.280 --> 00:33:41.220
and the first thing you hear
is, 'Oh, he's the bad one.'

00:33:41.220 --> 00:33:43.570
You have to listen to the stories.

00:33:43.570 --> 00:33:45.580 position:56%
That's what we do in living history.

00:33:45.580 --> 00:33:49.610
It gives us a chance to explain and
answer questions and to interact

00:33:49.610 --> 00:33:52.750
with the people as opposed
to the regular re-enactments

00:33:52.750 --> 00:33:55.060
where they sit while the
troops do what happened

00:33:55.060 --> 00:33:57.390
in the field and then it's over.

00:33:57.390 --> 00:34:00.010
But this gives you a
chance to go one-on-one.

00:34:00.010 --> 00:34:01.930
We learn stuff from spectators.

00:34:01.930 --> 00:34:03.880
They learn stuff from us.

00:34:03.880 --> 00:34:05.800
But I want to tell
them who Sherman was,

00:34:05.800 --> 00:34:08.190
why he did this, why he did that.

00:34:08.190 --> 00:34:12.090
You say this is what happened,
and this is what didn't happen.

00:34:12.090 --> 00:34:14.400
And you can judge for yourself.

00:34:14.400 --> 00:34:17.030
You can walk away and
still hate the guy.

00:34:17.030 --> 00:34:18.440
That's your prerogative.

00:34:18.440 --> 00:34:22.070
I don't mind."

00:34:22.070 --> 00:34:26.570
The range of reasons to
re-enact can include having fun

00:34:26.570 --> 00:34:29.320
and hanging out with your buddies.

00:34:29.320 --> 00:34:32.930
For some, it's an opportunity to
express personal regional pride

00:34:32.930 --> 00:34:36.760
as it is for Ed Mann on the
screen, a South Carolina man

00:34:36.760 --> 00:34:40.150
who portrays Confederate
General Stonewall Jackson.

00:34:40.150 --> 00:34:44.660
Words and attitudes
express political ideology.

00:34:44.660 --> 00:34:48.120
Yet for others such as Jim,
who portrays General Sherman,

00:34:48.120 --> 00:34:54.490
it's a commitment to
unbiased historical accuracy.

00:34:54.490 --> 00:34:57.710
Frank Orlando takes his
mandate for accurate

00:34:57.710 --> 00:35:01.420
and precision one step further.

00:35:01.420 --> 00:35:04.470
He believes that a truthful
portrayal fosters not only the

00:35:04.470 --> 00:35:09.610
general historical record, but
the individual being portrayed.

00:35:09.610 --> 00:35:12.090
And also it's a service to
the contemporary visitor.

00:35:12.090 --> 00:35:15.450
His personal mission is
a mandate for accuracy.

00:35:15.450 --> 00:35:20.460
Accuracy of uniform, of
attitude, of history.

00:35:20.460 --> 00:35:23.360
Frank, a retired school
teacher from Pennsylvania,

00:35:23.360 --> 00:35:26.120
portrays Confederate
General Robert E. Lee.

00:35:26.120 --> 00:35:31.220
And his wife, Bonnie,
portrays Mary Custis Lee here

00:35:31.220 --> 00:35:34.660
at the Gettysburg National
Military Park.

00:35:34.660 --> 00:35:38.210
They're both deeply
committed to accuracy.

00:35:38.210 --> 00:35:42.470
"We refuse -- we refuse
to walk around here

00:35:42.470 --> 00:35:45.490
and be inaccurate historically

00:35:45.490 --> 00:35:47.740
because we're doing the
tourists here an injustice,

00:35:47.740 --> 00:35:52.160 position:56%
and we're doing ourselves an
injustice as well because if we want

00:35:52.160 --> 00:35:57.360 position:56%
to get into that persona, into the
character then, and think like them,

00:35:57.360 --> 00:36:01.850
then we must look like
them as well."

00:36:01.850 --> 00:36:04.460
General Lee, according to
Frank, wore a particular shade

00:36:04.460 --> 00:36:07.340
of wool called cadet
gray, a color closer

00:36:07.340 --> 00:36:11.000
to blue than Confederate gray.

00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:14.910
He spent five months searching
for the right seamstress

00:36:14.910 --> 00:36:18.090
who will help him order the wool
fabric from the same factory

00:36:18.090 --> 00:36:21.420
in Richmond, Virginia that made
General Lee's original uniform

00:36:21.420 --> 00:36:23.550
during the Civil War.

00:36:23.550 --> 00:36:25.980
The fabric had to be custom made.

00:36:25.980 --> 00:36:27.810
It took six months.

00:36:27.810 --> 00:36:31.120
But Frank believes that "it
was well worth the wait.

00:36:31.120 --> 00:36:34.680
So now when I walk, when
I do impressions of Lee,

00:36:34.680 --> 00:36:37.140
I know what I'm wearing
is historically accurate.

00:36:37.140 --> 00:36:43.090
I also have a belt, presentation
belt that is accurate.

00:36:43.090 --> 00:36:46.270
It's an exact copy of the
one that Robert E. Lee wore;

00:36:46.270 --> 00:36:48.460
and then the belt buckle
was actually cast

00:36:48.460 --> 00:36:50.810
from Robert E. Lee's
belt buckle at the Museum

00:36:50.810 --> 00:36:53.460
of the Confederacy in
Richmond, Virginia.

00:36:53.460 --> 00:36:57.960
So you try to be as accurate
as you possibly can."

00:36:57.960 --> 00:37:02.910
Frank looks like General Lee, which
humanizes the historical figure.

00:37:02.910 --> 00:37:07.590
He enters a persona from the
outside just as theater actors do.

00:37:07.590 --> 00:37:09.460
Frank engages in something
we can call --

00:37:09.460 --> 00:37:12.540
some people have called--
method re-enacting.

00:37:12.540 --> 00:37:16.480
The result is amalgamation of the
actor with the historical persona

00:37:16.480 --> 00:37:20.400
and Frank Orlando admitted
to me, "It gets to the point

00:37:20.400 --> 00:37:22.640
where I have a difficult
time differentiating

00:37:22.640 --> 00:37:24.900
between Robert E. Lee and myself.

00:37:24.900 --> 00:37:27.050
You know, it almost meshes.

00:37:27.050 --> 00:37:30.340
And so that makes it
quite interesting."

00:37:30.340 --> 00:37:32.370
His goal is not just
persona, though.

00:37:32.370 --> 00:37:35.240
He has a higher pedagogical agenda.

00:37:35.240 --> 00:37:36.760
He's a teacher.

00:37:36.760 --> 00:37:39.970
Frank admires Robert E.
Lee's leadership skills.

00:37:39.970 --> 00:37:43.370
Through his impersonation, he
hopes to "impress upon people,

00:37:43.370 --> 00:37:46.020
today's people how
important duty was

00:37:46.020 --> 00:37:49.560
to the people of the
1850s and 1860s."

00:37:49.560 --> 00:37:52.430 position:56%
Frank feels a double responsibility.

00:37:52.430 --> 00:37:58.570
One for truth and accuracy to the
visitor, the other for honesty

00:37:58.570 --> 00:38:00.610
to the memory of General Lee.

00:38:00.610 --> 00:38:05.300
"I wouldn't want to slight Robert
E. Lee by doing something in public

00:38:05.300 --> 00:38:07.500
that he would be ashamed of.

00:38:07.500 --> 00:38:09.140
You know, he's not with us anymore.

00:38:09.140 --> 00:38:11.520
Robert E. Lee died in 1870."

00:38:11.520 --> 00:38:16.540
While portraying General Lee, Frank
gets to embody military strategy

00:38:16.540 --> 00:38:20.940
and moral responsibility,
but also chivalry and charm,

00:38:20.940 --> 00:38:25.460
traits generally missing from
contemporary political leaders.

00:38:25.460 --> 00:38:28.050
I don't have to tell you that.

00:38:28.050 --> 00:38:33.160 position:56%
Just look at the news at any moment,
and you know what I'm talking about.

00:38:33.160 --> 00:38:38.240
Biased or unbiased education is a
prerogative of the living historian

00:38:38.240 --> 00:38:40.400
and Civil War battlefields.

00:38:40.400 --> 00:38:42.310
Unlike Colonial Williamsburg

00:38:42.310 --> 00:38:46.140
where there is an overarching
pedagogical agenda mandated

00:38:46.140 --> 00:38:51.000
by a ruling body, everyone at
a battlefield is on his own

00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:54.840
to do his own research,
to write his own script

00:38:54.840 --> 00:38:59.000
and to give whatever slant
to history he chooses.

00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:01.900
These men don authentic-looking
uniforms

00:39:01.900 --> 00:39:06.160 position:56%
and teach themselves their persona's
biography and combat strategies,

00:39:06.160 --> 00:39:08.790
engaging in the main goal
of the living historian,

00:39:08.790 --> 00:39:11.390
that of public education.

00:39:11.390 --> 00:39:15.850
The accurately attired persona
becomes a vehicle for instruction

00:39:15.850 --> 00:39:21.110
for thousands of people every
summer in the battlefield.

00:39:21.110 --> 00:39:25.810 position:56%
History, heritage and education
combine in the living history museum

00:39:25.810 --> 00:39:28.290
and in the Civil War battlefield.

00:39:28.290 --> 00:39:32.740
At Colonial Williamsburg, history
self-consciously reconstituted

00:39:32.740 --> 00:39:36.250
and interpreted by a team
of trained professionals

00:39:36.250 --> 00:39:42.540
with an institutional pedagogical
agenda where both authenticity

00:39:42.540 --> 00:39:46.410
and public education
drive the costume choices.

00:39:46.410 --> 00:39:49.400
Interpreters at Colonial
Williamsburg participate

00:39:49.400 --> 00:39:55.050
in educational celebration of
the nation's political heritage.

00:39:55.050 --> 00:39:58.320
Within the frame, as we
saw today, they are for you

00:39:58.320 --> 00:40:03.380
to follow personal agendas
of race, class and gender.

00:40:03.380 --> 00:40:07.190
Civil War re-enactors
are self-directed.

00:40:07.190 --> 00:40:10.020
They invest their own
money and research skills

00:40:10.020 --> 00:40:12.720
to authenticate the
uniforms they wear.

00:40:12.720 --> 00:40:16.180
Their internal drive for
authenticity allows them to engage

00:40:16.180 --> 00:40:18.920
in a personally defined
educational mission

00:40:18.920 --> 00:40:22.700
to impart historical knowledge
to the general public.

00:40:22.700 --> 00:40:26.870
Operating as individuals, not
living historians in a museum,

00:40:26.870 --> 00:40:31.810
they are free to pursue personally
satisfying actions of comradery

00:40:31.810 --> 00:40:35.410
and male bonding, self-education
and they're permitted

00:40:35.410 --> 00:40:37.080
to express their own opinions

00:40:37.080 --> 00:40:42.220
about the historical events often
using the 19th century as a foil

00:40:42.220 --> 00:40:46.660
to make contemporary
criticism of the government.

00:40:46.660 --> 00:40:50.100
Accurate costumes play a vital
role in enhancing the experience

00:40:50.100 --> 00:40:54.460
of visitors and participants and
many kinds of historic sites.

00:40:54.460 --> 00:40:57.130
The difference among historic
sites holds implication

00:40:57.130 --> 00:40:59.270
for costuming decisions.

00:40:59.270 --> 00:41:02.460
Levels of authenticity
and motivation may vary,

00:41:02.460 --> 00:41:03.760
but the sincerity

00:41:03.760 --> 00:41:09.010 position:56%
of the participants makes the
meaningful expressions and costumes.

00:41:09.010 --> 00:41:12.200
In Civil War re-enacting, the
abundance of data leads to a sense

00:41:12.200 --> 00:41:15.160
of authenticity in uniform.

00:41:15.160 --> 00:41:16.770
At Colonial Williamsburg,

00:41:16.770 --> 00:41:21.730
specialized scholarship ultimately
makes authentic costumes possible.

00:41:21.730 --> 00:41:26.600
By considering costumes in these
two locations linked by concerns

00:41:26.600 --> 00:41:31.870
for history, heritage and accuracy,
we find that a satisfying level

00:41:31.870 --> 00:41:35.840
of authenticity can be achieved
by re-enactors allowing them

00:41:35.840 --> 00:41:39.340
to envision, reconstruct
a personalized piece

00:41:39.340 --> 00:41:42.230
of the wearable past.

00:41:42.230 --> 00:41:46.040 position:56%
Whether during a bloody Civil War or
during the nationally mythic moment

00:41:46.040 --> 00:41:51.290 position:56%
of the American Revolution, costumes
draw their wearers and beholders

00:41:51.290 --> 00:41:55.900
into a deep place of emotion,
a philosophical reference

00:41:55.900 --> 00:41:58.530
of aesthetic fulfillment.

00:41:58.530 --> 00:42:02.530
Whether they participate actively
or passively, costume interpreters

00:42:02.530 --> 00:42:06.430
and their beholders travel
together to other times

00:42:06.430 --> 00:42:10.040
in our nation's history
and then return once more

00:42:10.040 --> 00:42:14.370
to the present tense
hopefully a little bit wiser.

00:42:14.370 --> 00:42:16.170
Thank you very much.

00:42:16.170 --> 00:42:26.380
[ Applause ]

00:42:26.380 --> 00:42:29.220
I know people are on their
lunch break so you can leave.

00:42:29.220 --> 00:42:30.800
Nobody will be hurt.

00:42:30.800 --> 00:42:37.170
And if anybody has any questions,
I'll be happy to answer them.

00:42:37.170 --> 00:42:38.820
Betsy.

00:42:38.820 --> 00:42:41.450
&gt;&gt; Betsy Peterson: With
the Civil War re-enactors

00:42:41.450 --> 00:42:45.640 position:56%
where it's a personal sort of thing,

00:42:45.640 --> 00:42:50.250
and the research is
done individually, how--

00:42:50.250 --> 00:42:55.020
when they come together what if
people show up as the same person?

00:42:55.020 --> 00:42:57.480
I mean, are there five
different Pickets that show up?

00:42:57.480 --> 00:42:59.280
&gt;&gt; Pravina Shukla; Yeah, yeah.

00:42:59.280 --> 00:43:02.200
&gt;&gt; Betsy Peterson: How did
they negotiate all of that

00:43:02.200 --> 00:43:08.150 position:56%
and how did they negotiate the sense
of - of the group sense of accuracy?

00:43:08.150 --> 00:43:13.600
I mean, if someone disagrees
with someone else's costume,

00:43:13.600 --> 00:43:17.370
how is all of that
negotiable and handled?

00:43:17.370 --> 00:43:18.710
&gt;&gt; Pravina Shukla: That's
a very good question.

00:43:18.710 --> 00:43:20.170
It has a lot of different parts.

00:43:20.170 --> 00:43:23.390 position:56%
So one of them is most of the people
re-enact the American Civil War

00:43:23.390 --> 00:43:25.420
are soldiers.

00:43:25.420 --> 00:43:28.070
They're part of groups and troops.

00:43:28.070 --> 00:43:32.250
And they do have somebody
internally as well as a lot

00:43:32.250 --> 00:43:34.870
of the battlefields have somebody
who's checking for accuracy.

00:43:34.870 --> 00:43:37.820 position:56%
So, if you wearing something
inaccurate, you can't be part of it.

00:43:37.820 --> 00:43:39.120
You would agree with this.

00:43:39.120 --> 00:43:40.420
So there's a lot written about it.

00:43:40.420 --> 00:43:42.490
If you look at the -- in my book --

00:43:42.490 --> 00:43:44.610
and now I'm hawking the
book that's for sale.

00:43:44.610 --> 00:43:47.520
In the book out there, there are

00:43:47.520 --> 00:43:50.740
in the footnotes all these
different Shiloh and Manassas,

00:43:50.740 --> 00:43:54.060
all these things have little --
when you sign up to re-enact,

00:43:54.060 --> 00:43:57.400
there are rules about what you
can wear, what you can't wear,

00:43:57.400 --> 00:44:00.660
what kinds of glasses, what kind of
wristwatch, what kind of clothing.

00:44:00.660 --> 00:44:03.510
So there's a lot of -- there is
also a lot of internal pressure

00:44:03.510 --> 00:44:06.130
when some people make fun
of you for being a "farb";

00:44:06.130 --> 00:44:10.120
for not actually wearing something
appropriate and authentic.

00:44:10.120 --> 00:44:11.420
So that's one.

00:44:11.420 --> 00:44:13.440
Before these generals --
the generals that you saw,

00:44:13.440 --> 00:44:16.450
the photographs from
Gettysburg and Manassas.

00:44:16.450 --> 00:44:21.950
And they were part of organized
groups: Lee's lieutenants

00:44:21.950 --> 00:44:26.850
and federal troops, I think
the other people were,

00:44:26.850 --> 00:44:28.370
and they have one Grant.

00:44:28.370 --> 00:44:31.350
But today the Grant can come
-- you're our backup Grant.

00:44:31.350 --> 00:44:32.860
Sherman can't come;
you're out back up Sherman.

00:44:32.860 --> 00:44:34.520
So they only have one of each.

00:44:34.520 --> 00:44:38.100
And they're in these living history
camps, and they're sitting there

00:44:38.100 --> 00:44:41.230
with their name on a plaque like,
"Hello, I'm General Sherman."

00:44:41.230 --> 00:44:43.640
So they're there to
tell you about history,

00:44:43.640 --> 00:44:46.800
whereas the troops are just there,
you see them from really far away.

00:44:46.800 --> 00:44:48.910
They do the battle and then
you may or may not interact

00:44:48.910 --> 00:44:50.260
with them in the same way.

00:44:50.260 --> 00:44:53.530
Most people have a big platform
in which you go and talk to them.

00:44:53.530 --> 00:44:55.660 position:56%
Does that answer all your questions?

00:44:55.660 --> 00:44:57.560
Yes.

00:44:57.560 --> 00:45:02.420 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Female audience member: Along
with that, I wonder if you can speak

00:45:02.420 --> 00:45:03.720
to -- specially what those --

00:45:03.720 --> 00:45:07.860
those who are being involved
in interaction, the complexity

00:45:07.860 --> 00:45:12.170
of first person versus
third person interpretation

00:45:12.170 --> 00:45:14.720
and how, or if that has....?

00:45:14.720 --> 00:45:16.020
&gt;&gt; Pravina Shukla: Yeah.

00:45:16.020 --> 00:45:17.320
That's a very good question, too.

00:45:17.320 --> 00:45:18.620
I live in Indiana.

00:45:18.620 --> 00:45:20.090
We have something called
Conner Prairie, which has --

00:45:20.090 --> 00:45:24.240
so Conner Prairie is a
living history museum,

00:45:24.240 --> 00:45:27.750
and the joke is you go there and
you say, "Hi, I came in my car."

00:45:27.750 --> 00:45:29.050
And they're like, "What's a car?

00:45:29.050 --> 00:45:30.350
I don't know what a car is."

00:45:30.350 --> 00:45:33.940
And sometimes it gets in the way
of - "You know what a car is.

00:45:33.940 --> 00:45:35.800
Answer my question!"

00:45:35.800 --> 00:45:40.700
So Colonial Williamsburg,
they talk in the first person,

00:45:40.700 --> 00:45:44.460
in the present tense,
but they can say--

00:45:44.460 --> 00:45:47.780
like with the tailor that you
saw a picture of, Mark Cutter,

00:45:47.780 --> 00:45:50.430
he said somebody's going to say,
"What about the sewing machine?

00:45:50.430 --> 00:45:51.730
What about the cotton gin?"

00:45:51.730 --> 00:45:54.210
And he can say "the cotton gin
has not been invented yet."

00:45:54.210 --> 00:45:55.510
So he understands.

00:45:55.510 --> 00:45:58.820
He's not pretending because there's
something lost here is you pretend

00:45:58.820 --> 00:46:00.240
like I don't know what
the cotton gin is.

00:46:00.240 --> 00:46:01.600
What is a sewing machine?

00:46:01.600 --> 00:46:04.210
So Williamsburg purposely,
they are allowed

00:46:04.210 --> 00:46:05.700
to say we understand what that is.

00:46:05.700 --> 00:46:07.000
That hasn't happened yet.

00:46:07.000 --> 00:46:08.300
The Civil War hasn't happened yet.

00:46:08.300 --> 00:46:09.600 position:56%
It's not going to happen for another
hundred years or whatever it is.

00:46:09.600 --> 00:46:12.200
So they are able to do that.

00:46:12.200 --> 00:46:14.760
These living historians also
go in first and third person.

00:46:14.760 --> 00:46:16.060
They go back and forth.

00:46:16.060 --> 00:46:18.450
They're talking as General
Longstreet or they'll talk

00:46:18.450 --> 00:46:21.570
as themselves about
General Longstreet.

00:46:21.570 --> 00:46:23.750
So they do both, and
I think that makes

00:46:23.750 --> 00:46:27.910
for better education personally,
if I come to this -- I'm a teacher.

00:46:27.910 --> 00:46:29.210
I come to this as a teacher,

00:46:29.210 --> 00:46:32.220
and I think that makes
it easier for everybody.

00:46:32.220 --> 00:46:33.520
Yes, Steve.

00:46:33.520 --> 00:46:35.220
&gt;&gt; Steve Winick: So I'm part
of the re-enacting group

00:46:35.220 --> 00:46:41.110
that actually re-enacts the U.S.
Navy during the War of 1812,

00:46:41.110 --> 00:46:42.530
which is pretty specific.

00:46:42.530 --> 00:46:44.860
&gt;&gt; Pravina Shukla: And I'm very
disappointed you're not in costume.

00:46:44.860 --> 00:46:46.360
&gt;&gt; Steve Winick: But one of
the things that's interesting.

00:46:46.360 --> 00:46:50.440
We have a subset of people who are
primarily singers and sing songs

00:46:50.440 --> 00:46:53.660
of the era, which is one of
the reasons I'm in the group,

00:46:53.660 --> 00:46:55.960
and one of the things that's
interesting about the songs

00:46:55.960 --> 00:47:01.700
of the era is that they often
feature women who dress as men

00:47:01.700 --> 00:47:06.300
and go to sea or go to war, and
because of that we frequently have

00:47:06.300 --> 00:47:08.480
within the group one or two women

00:47:08.480 --> 00:47:12.190
who are re-enacting
ostensibly male characters,

00:47:12.190 --> 00:47:14.560
but they're re-enacting women
who are dressed like men,

00:47:14.560 --> 00:47:15.950
who are cross-dressing as men.

00:47:15.950 --> 00:47:18.490
And I wonder if that's something
you've encountered and what kind

00:47:18.490 --> 00:47:23.380
of issues have come up along gender
lines with these [inaudible] actor?

00:47:23.380 --> 00:47:26.320
&gt;&gt; Pravina Shukla: I have not --
at both Gettysburg and Manassas,

00:47:26.320 --> 00:47:29.420
there were in these photographs
both Henry [Glassie] and I took

00:47:29.420 --> 00:47:32.580
of all these massive
re-enactors, troops.

00:47:32.580 --> 00:47:36.220
They were women, but I didn't
actually talk to any of them,

00:47:36.220 --> 00:47:39.530
but we know for a fact in the
American Civil War there were a lot

00:47:39.530 --> 00:47:42.010
of women who cross-dressed
as men, and all the ways

00:47:42.010 --> 00:47:49.380
in which they negotiated physical
problems of going to the bathroom,

00:47:49.380 --> 00:47:52.080
but there were wonderful ways
in which they were able to fight

00:47:52.080 --> 00:47:54.320
for whatever reason to be
with their sweethearts,

00:47:54.320 --> 00:47:56.900
for patriotic reasons,
but I did not.

00:47:56.900 --> 00:47:59.840
And I think I'd love to
continue this work and maybe look

00:47:59.840 --> 00:48:03.490
at that a little bit more,
but I have not done that.

00:48:03.490 --> 00:48:05.720
Yes.

00:48:05.720 --> 00:48:07.600
&gt;&gt; Male audience member:
Have you ever spoken

00:48:07.600 --> 00:48:16.620
to an European reenactors, and
did you find any differences?

00:48:16.620 --> 00:48:17.920
&gt;&gt; Pravina Shukla: No.

00:48:17.920 --> 00:48:19.220
I have not.

00:48:19.220 --> 00:48:22.330
I've read about European
re-enactments in Spain and in a lot

00:48:22.330 --> 00:48:25.680
of different parts of
Scandinavia, especially Sweden.

00:48:25.680 --> 00:48:30.530
I have not, but one
of the case studies

00:48:30.530 --> 00:48:35.450
in my costume book is the
Society for Creative Anachronism,

00:48:35.450 --> 00:48:38.970
which is re-enacting in the U.S.,
in essence, battles in Europe.

00:48:38.970 --> 00:48:43.130
So there's that kind of
disjoint of we're not there.

00:48:43.130 --> 00:48:46.570
The clothing that you'd be wearing
in northern Europe is too hot

00:48:46.570 --> 00:48:50.960
for the summer in southern United
States, so there is that problem.

00:48:50.960 --> 00:48:53.320
And Europe, obviously,
you're going to be in Europe.

00:48:53.320 --> 00:48:57.100
The material called -- the
history is much longer there,

00:48:57.100 --> 00:49:01.160
deeper and there's a lot
more interest in archeology

00:49:01.160 --> 00:49:02.650
and material culture in that way.

00:49:02.650 --> 00:49:03.950
So from what I understand--

00:49:03.950 --> 00:49:07.160
I have not personally studied
Europe-- re-enactment groups...

00:49:07.160 --> 00:49:10.490
The emphasis on material
culture research is pretty good,

00:49:10.490 --> 00:49:12.030
particularly archeology.

00:49:12.030 --> 00:49:15.200
But that's the extent
of what I know.

00:49:15.200 --> 00:49:16.500
Yes?

00:49:16.500 --> 00:49:18.620
&gt;&gt; James Deutsch: You
seem to be saying --

00:49:18.620 --> 00:49:24.600
refer to 'actors,' interpreters for
Revolutionary War and 're-enactors'

00:49:24.600 --> 00:49:28.770
so is there a difference
between acting and re-enacting?

00:49:28.770 --> 00:49:31.610 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Pravina Shukla: I'm using that
term because that's a term they use.

00:49:31.610 --> 00:49:35.110
Colonial Williamsburg, they call
themselves "actor interpreters"

00:49:35.110 --> 00:49:37.780
so I'm using the term
that they actually use.

00:49:37.780 --> 00:49:42.170
That does not have a judgment on
my part about who's a better actor.

00:49:42.170 --> 00:49:45.680
But some of the Colonial
Williamsburg people do.

00:49:45.680 --> 00:49:48.440
They don't just walk and so they
have this Revolutionary City,

00:49:48.440 --> 00:49:49.740
little mini plays.

00:49:49.740 --> 00:49:52.620
I don't know if anybody's ever been
there recently, somewhat recent....

00:49:52.620 --> 00:49:54.890
You get a schedule.

00:49:54.890 --> 00:49:57.130
Monday at three, they'll
be doing this

00:49:57.130 --> 00:49:59.350 position:56%
at this tavern, this somewhere else.

00:49:59.350 --> 00:50:01.340
But sometimes they
do get up on stage.

00:50:01.340 --> 00:50:03.140
So some of those are more trained.

00:50:03.140 --> 00:50:06.400
They see themselves as actor and
not just walking around in costume.

00:50:06.400 --> 00:50:09.670
They're delivering
lines, blocking the --

00:50:09.670 --> 00:50:14.380
and some of these Civil
War re-enactors do get up.

00:50:14.380 --> 00:50:16.950
We went to the anniversary
of the Battle of Gettysburg,

00:50:16.950 --> 00:50:23.110
and there was a big stage with
2000 people in the audience,

00:50:23.110 --> 00:50:27.910
and Generals Lee and
Longstreet were --

00:50:27.910 --> 00:50:30.520
Pickett were discussing [inaudible]
were discussing the strategy.

00:50:30.520 --> 00:50:32.950
So they were acting to
some extent but not all

00:50:32.950 --> 00:50:36.310
of these people are considered -- a
lot of re-enactors are not actors.

00:50:36.310 --> 00:50:39.320
They're just there for
the pleasure of being

00:50:39.320 --> 00:50:40.840
with other friends of theirs.

00:50:40.840 --> 00:50:42.260
So they're not actually
acting in the sense

00:50:42.260 --> 00:50:44.020
of delivering lines, but some are.

00:50:44.020 --> 00:50:47.160
So there is an internal
difference, I guess.

00:50:47.160 --> 00:50:49.760
Anybody -- yes?

00:50:49.760 --> 00:50:51.100
&gt;&gt; Greg Adams: Thank you
for your presentation.

00:50:51.100 --> 00:50:52.400
I enjoyed it very much.

00:50:52.400 --> 00:50:58.940
Since the mid '90s, I've
been involved with a lot

00:50:58.940 --> 00:51:03.840
of Civil War reenacting
and living history events

00:51:03.840 --> 00:51:08.400
for the purpose of
restoring the music.

00:51:08.400 --> 00:51:15.680
And it was interesting to see the
dialogue taking place not only

00:51:15.680 --> 00:51:19.930
in terms of material
culture but also in terms

00:51:19.930 --> 00:51:22.590
of the repertoire, interpretation.

00:51:22.590 --> 00:51:31.240
The difference between the people
that are very focused on ideas

00:51:31.240 --> 00:51:36.750
about being authentic, having
accurate reproduction material

00:51:36.750 --> 00:51:41.590
yet they might show up with their
1979 Gibson Mastertone banjo

00:51:41.590 --> 00:51:45.400
as opposed to reproduce
1850s instrument.

00:51:45.400 --> 00:51:48.870
To what degree are you seeing
material culture related to music

00:51:48.870 --> 00:51:51.540
and dialogues that go
along with that in terms

00:51:51.540 --> 00:51:53.230
of repertoire and content?

00:51:53.230 --> 00:51:55.020
&gt;&gt; Pravina Shukla: I don't
know enough about that

00:51:55.020 --> 00:51:58.470 position:56%
to give you an answer that would
tell you more than you already know.

00:51:58.470 --> 00:51:59.890
But I'll tell you one thing.

00:51:59.890 --> 00:52:03.070
If you've been to Gettysburg
or any of these re-enactments,

00:52:03.070 --> 00:52:07.180
part of what facilitates
the authenticity

00:52:07.180 --> 00:52:11.980
and material culture not
musical instruments but weapons

00:52:11.980 --> 00:52:14.820
and uniforms is that there
are specialized shops

00:52:14.820 --> 00:52:16.120
that are selling these things.

00:52:16.120 --> 00:52:17.420
To some extent, you don't have
to really do your own research.

00:52:17.420 --> 00:52:18.720
You show up to one of
these re-enactments.

00:52:18.720 --> 00:52:20.020
They have a little village thing
with food and hotdogs and whatever,

00:52:20.020 --> 00:52:21.320
and they also have a place
that sells the uniforms,

00:52:21.320 --> 00:52:22.620
the shaving things, socks, shoes.

00:52:22.620 --> 00:52:23.920
So some of that is easier and it
has to do with just being able

00:52:23.920 --> 00:52:25.260
to purchase it versus maybe in
other aspects of material culture

00:52:25.260 --> 00:52:26.640
that are not military, not
uniform based you'd have

00:52:26.640 --> 00:52:27.940
to do your own research.

00:52:27.940 --> 00:52:29.240 position:56%
That's where some people's
research skills would differentiate.

00:52:29.240 --> 00:52:30.540
I don't know if that was
a good enough answer.

00:52:30.540 --> 00:52:31.840
Yes, Alan.

00:52:31.840 --> 00:52:33.670
&gt;&gt;Alan Jabbour: Following up
from Betsy's question: Well,

00:52:33.670 --> 00:52:36.890
I'll phrase it this way:
Karen and I have done work

00:52:36.890 --> 00:52:41.060
with Decoration Events, and I
got fascinated with the fact

00:52:41.060 --> 00:52:45.590
that asking people, "Well,
who orchestrates it all?

00:52:45.590 --> 00:52:47.720
Who invites the preacher?

00:52:47.720 --> 00:52:49.050
And which preacher?

00:52:49.050 --> 00:52:54.130
Who makes the discussion about
this and that and the other thing?"

00:52:54.130 --> 00:52:57.580
Amazingly, sometimes, I
could not find an answer.

00:52:57.580 --> 00:53:01.190
There was no puppet
pulling on the strings,

00:53:01.190 --> 00:53:04.460
making it all happen
in a coordinated way.

00:53:04.460 --> 00:53:08.980
So I got fascinated by
this sort of grass-roots,

00:53:08.980 --> 00:53:12.540
consensus-guided way
of decision making.

00:53:12.540 --> 00:53:19.220 position:56%
And it sounds to me like-I mean, its
one thing for the interview to deal

00:53:19.220 --> 00:53:23.120
with how you present
yourself, but how to you decide

00:53:23.120 --> 00:53:28.710
on Picket's charge, you know,
how to charge, and where to stop,

00:53:28.710 --> 00:53:31.960
and who falls and things like that?

00:53:31.960 --> 00:53:34.320
Is there somebody making
those decisions?

00:53:34.320 --> 00:53:35.620
&gt;&gt;Pravina Shukla: There are.

00:53:35.620 --> 00:53:36.920
And there are generals.

00:53:36.920 --> 00:53:38.490
There are people in
charge of the troops.

00:53:38.490 --> 00:53:41.040
At some point, they'll be like,
"Okay, it's been ten minutes.

00:53:41.040 --> 00:53:42.340
Somebody has to die."

00:53:42.340 --> 00:53:44.520
Yeah. "You have to start dying.

00:53:44.520 --> 00:53:49.000
Come on!" And then one of the guys
I showed the Massachusetts 28th --

00:53:49.000 --> 00:53:51.660
the guy from Massachusetts 28th,
he has this wonderful moment

00:53:51.660 --> 00:53:53.960
in which I said, "Do you
ever have the magic moment?

00:53:53.960 --> 00:53:55.260
" And he said, "I do."

00:53:55.260 --> 00:53:57.310
"Are you ever transported
back to the Civil War era?"

00:53:57.310 --> 00:54:01.710
He says, "I do when I die,
because then I am alive.

00:54:01.710 --> 00:54:06.330
My eyes are closed, and I can hear
and just the sound of all of that,

00:54:06.330 --> 00:54:09.790
of people running, people
falling, people screaming" --

00:54:09.790 --> 00:54:14.860
to him brings him to the Civil War
era because he says it goes back

00:54:14.860 --> 00:54:16.510
to the answer I gave Betsy.

00:54:16.510 --> 00:54:19.420
He says visually people are
much older and much bigger

00:54:19.420 --> 00:54:20.960
than they were in the Civil War.

00:54:20.960 --> 00:54:22.260
They don't really.

00:54:22.260 --> 00:54:24.080
I mean that Stonewall Jackson
guy is maybe 100 pounds heavier

00:54:24.080 --> 00:54:25.900
than Stonewall Jackson was himself.

00:54:25.900 --> 00:54:27.770
They don't really look
like them necessarily

00:54:27.770 --> 00:54:30.800 position:56%
because we just have different body
types now than we did 100 years ago,

00:54:30.800 --> 00:54:34.850 position:56%
but sometimes the sound and dying in
that respect allows certain people

00:54:34.850 --> 00:54:37.400
to experience a deeper
version of that.

00:54:37.400 --> 00:54:38.880
I just want to say one more thing.

00:54:38.880 --> 00:54:40.460
This is not your question.

00:54:40.460 --> 00:54:43.950
I'm just going to add
to your question.

00:54:43.950 --> 00:54:46.920
The difference between
these two groups:

00:54:46.920 --> 00:54:49.120
the Colonial Williamsburg
people work.

00:54:49.120 --> 00:54:51.390
They're employed at the museum.

00:54:51.390 --> 00:54:53.020
Somebody's doing everything
for them.

00:54:53.020 --> 00:54:56.420
Every single thing about them is
provided to them, the background

00:54:56.420 --> 00:54:58.000
of their character, the clothing,

00:54:58.000 --> 00:55:01.840
etc. Civil War guys are
doing all their own research,

00:55:01.840 --> 00:55:04.570
they're spending a lot of
their own money, a lot of time

00:55:04.570 --> 00:55:06.750 position:56%
and there's something very admirable

00:55:06.750 --> 00:55:08.870
to me the fact that
they're doing that.

00:55:08.870 --> 00:55:12.160 position:56%
One of the guys I showed, Jay Vogle,
the guy who does the Pickett charge,

00:55:12.160 --> 00:55:16.010 position:56%
he actually re-enacts as Longstreet.

00:55:16.010 --> 00:55:21.180
And he took the entire
curriculum that Longstreet had read

00:55:21.180 --> 00:55:23.670
at Westpoint and read it all

00:55:23.670 --> 00:55:27.820 position:56%
so that he would understand what did
Longstreet know in order to be able

00:55:27.820 --> 00:55:29.620
to come up with this
military strategy.

00:55:29.620 --> 00:55:31.400 position:56%
He was doing that in his spare time.

00:55:31.400 --> 00:55:32.700
The man's a computer programmer.

00:55:32.700 --> 00:55:34.090
That's not his job.

00:55:34.090 --> 00:55:35.850
So what I love is that
they're spending

00:55:35.850 --> 00:55:40.620
so much time educating themselves
and sometimes there are some people

00:55:40.620 --> 00:55:44.100
who at least they have
-- they get together.

00:55:44.100 --> 00:55:46.550
They will -- they are coordinated.

00:55:46.550 --> 00:55:48.010
You have to pay insurance.

00:55:48.010 --> 00:55:50.580
You have to be organized
to some extent,

00:55:50.580 --> 00:55:52.130
but a lot of it is self-motivation.

00:55:52.130 --> 00:55:53.460
And that's really admirable.

00:55:53.460 --> 00:55:54.900
It's really easy to
make fun of these guys.

00:55:54.900 --> 00:55:56.520
They put on wool uniforms....

00:55:56.520 --> 00:55:57.820
It's wonderful.

00:55:57.820 --> 00:56:01.300
I mean, God, if everybody would
just spend this much time educating

00:56:01.300 --> 00:56:06.060
themselves about a topic,
it'd be really great.

00:56:06.060 --> 00:56:07.910
Danille?

00:56:07.910 --> 00:56:10.030
&gt;&gt;Danille Christensen:
Thank you for the talk.

00:56:10.030 --> 00:56:18.750
I was just talking with a friend
of mine whose son would dearly love

00:56:18.750 --> 00:56:26.750
to be a reenactor, but he
doesn't have the money for it,

00:56:26.750 --> 00:56:32.910
and he found someone who was
willing to give him an outlay

00:56:32.910 --> 00:56:39.330
of an entire uniform that
he couldn't wear anymore

00:56:39.330 --> 00:56:41.590
because he had grown larger.

00:56:41.590 --> 00:56:44.030
But it was a Confederate uniform.

00:56:44.030 --> 00:56:50.840
And this boy decided not to
do that because he didn't want

00:56:50.840 --> 00:57:00.710
to be perceived as supporting some
of the ideas...the particular flag,

00:57:00.710 --> 00:57:02.970
the White Power, things
like that, right?

00:57:02.970 --> 00:57:08.000
So do you get a lot of this merging
of fictional and real worlds....

00:57:08.000 --> 00:57:13.080
The embodiment of putting on
a costume really, sort of,

00:57:13.080 --> 00:57:15.120
explores that in a
million different ways.

00:57:15.120 --> 00:57:16.650
When you're talking about film,
or stage, or even Williamsburg

00:57:16.650 --> 00:57:18.330
as the site of reenactments, where
there's a performance space, right?

00:57:18.330 --> 00:57:19.680
And so on the battlefield
did you find anyone, who,

00:57:19.680 --> 00:57:21.270
like purposely introduced an
anachronism in order to sort

00:57:21.270 --> 00:57:22.650
of keep themselves grounded
in the real world instead

00:57:22.650 --> 00:57:25.190
of being completely
absorbed in this reenactment?

00:57:25.190 --> 00:57:28.300
&gt;&gt; Pravina Shukla: Did I, Henry?

00:57:28.300 --> 00:57:35.010 position:56%
I did in the other -- the book looks
at costuming different contexts.

00:57:35.010 --> 00:57:36.600
And in the theater -- it ends

00:57:36.600 --> 00:57:39.380
with the theater actor
on the theater stage.

00:57:39.380 --> 00:57:40.680
That's the most professional.

00:57:40.680 --> 00:57:42.620
It begins with Halloween:
"I'll just put on --

00:57:42.620 --> 00:57:45.400
I'll just make this thing," to all
the way to the most professional.

00:57:45.400 --> 00:57:49.480
There's a continuum, and in
the end in the theater chapter,

00:57:49.480 --> 00:57:52.060
a lot of actors - 'this
is my necklace.

00:57:52.060 --> 00:57:53.360
It's me Pravina.

00:57:53.360 --> 00:57:55.650
It reminds me I'm Pravina
playing Juliet.'

00:57:55.650 --> 00:58:00.230
So the actors on the theater stage
do that, but I can't remember

00:58:00.230 --> 00:58:02.070
if we saw anything like this here.

00:58:02.070 --> 00:58:04.640
Did we? Okay.

00:58:04.640 --> 00:58:05.940
I have two memories.

00:58:05.940 --> 00:58:07.990
One is here and one is over there.

00:58:07.990 --> 00:58:10.160 position:56%
No, but that's an interesting point.

00:58:10.160 --> 00:58:14.220 position:56%
The point -- it was I think obvious,
but I'm just going to say it again.

00:58:14.220 --> 00:58:20.160 position:56%
I as a regular person would not have
the opportunity to stand in front

00:58:20.160 --> 00:58:24.830
of 2000 people and pass judgment
on the contemporary government.

00:58:24.830 --> 00:58:27.170
But if I'm General
Longstreet and I'm standing --

00:58:27.170 --> 00:58:29.740
so a lot of people really
seize the opportunity

00:58:29.740 --> 00:58:32.230
of it's not me, it's those people.

00:58:32.230 --> 00:58:34.620
And that allows every
example of costuming.

00:58:34.620 --> 00:58:35.920
"It's not me.

00:58:35.920 --> 00:58:40.000
I'm just a regular professor,
but really this slutty milk maid

00:58:40.000 --> 00:58:42.970
that I am right now
is not me, but it is."

00:58:42.970 --> 00:58:44.290
It's just a version of yourself.

00:58:44.290 --> 00:58:48.370
People use this platform to
show something that's deep,

00:58:48.370 --> 00:58:50.940
that should not come out
but it does come out,

00:58:50.940 --> 00:58:52.930
and that's absolutely what
a lot of people are doing.

00:58:52.930 --> 00:58:54.530
I don't think -- it's
not always negative.

00:58:54.530 --> 00:58:56.300
Sometimes it's positive:
You know, "I'm a shy person,

00:58:56.300 --> 00:58:58.210
but I want to be this
wild and crazy,

00:58:58.210 --> 00:59:01.090
funny person so I do
it every October 31."

00:59:01.090 --> 00:59:02.420
It's the one time I can do it.

00:59:02.420 --> 00:59:05.400
And that does happen a lot
in Civil War re-enacting.

00:59:05.400 --> 00:59:06.700
"It's not me.

00:59:06.700 --> 00:59:08.000
I'm a nice person,

00:59:08.000 --> 00:59:11.810
but I'm portraying this
Confederate soldier."

00:59:11.810 --> 00:59:14.110
Yes, Diana.

00:59:16.110 --> 00:59:17.410
&gt;&gt; Diana NDiaye: Thank you.

00:59:17.410 --> 00:59:20.510
This is wonderful and
I love your book!

00:59:20.510 --> 00:59:27.270
I'm curious: with the remaking of
"Roots" there was a real attempt

00:59:27.270 --> 00:59:32.490
to correct some of the, well
I guess, in anachronisms,

00:59:32.490 --> 00:59:39.250
some of the incorrect
costuming as well as statements

00:59:39.250 --> 00:59:45.910
and the understanding of
slavery that has developed

00:59:45.910 --> 00:59:50.570
since the first "Roots" was done.

00:59:50.570 --> 00:59:57.880
Do you find that with reenactors
or actors, like at Williamsburg

00:59:57.880 --> 00:59:59.190
and at other places,
that people talk

00:59:59.190 --> 01:00:00.520
about an evolution of
[inaudible] or what?

01:00:00.520 --> 01:00:01.960
&gt;&gt;Pravina Shukla: Absolutely.

01:00:01.960 --> 01:00:04.450
You go to -- it's not
even just costume

01:00:04.450 --> 01:00:05.750
as material culture in general.

01:00:05.750 --> 01:00:11.960
You go to a historic reproduced,
recreated museum, house museum.

01:00:11.960 --> 01:00:13.770
Every city has a hundred
house museums.

01:00:13.770 --> 01:00:15.880
The first president of
whatever, the first --

01:00:15.880 --> 01:00:19.510
and all of those by looking at --

01:00:19.510 --> 01:00:24.150
we took a tour of these
plantation houses in South Carolina

01:00:24.150 --> 01:00:28.450
and by looking at the
different rooms, the accuracy

01:00:28.450 --> 01:00:31.680
or how the furniture and the wood

01:00:31.680 --> 01:00:36.880
and the wallpaper was done
you could tell when -- that --

01:00:36.880 --> 01:00:40.690
the room is not telling
you as much about 1870.

01:00:40.690 --> 01:00:44.860
It's telling you about 1970
versus 1990 versus 2010

01:00:44.860 --> 01:00:49.900
when these particular ways
of preserving and conserving

01:00:49.900 --> 01:00:52.400
and refabricating material
culture was.

01:00:52.400 --> 01:00:54.650
So the same thing:
If you look at any --

01:00:54.650 --> 01:00:58.520
look at the costume of
Queen Elizabeth I in movies

01:00:58.520 --> 01:01:00.110
and theater and photographs.

01:01:00.110 --> 01:01:01.790
You can tell when that costume --

01:01:01.790 --> 01:01:05.410
it doesn't say about her in
16 whatever, 15 whatever.

01:01:05.410 --> 01:01:09.600
It says about when we thought
that was how she looked.

01:01:09.600 --> 01:01:10.900
So absolutely.

01:01:10.900 --> 01:01:15.750
Says as much about our contemporary
view as about conservation,

01:01:15.750 --> 01:01:19.530
honestly, and recreation
and costume as it does

01:01:19.530 --> 01:01:21.860
about the period that's being
depicted, and that's actually very,

01:01:21.860 --> 01:01:23.700
very interesting to do,
to look at that and try

01:01:23.700 --> 01:01:26.730
to figure out when was this done.

01:01:26.730 --> 01:01:28.030
Thank you.

01:01:28.030 --> 01:01:29.450
Oh, Cliff.

01:01:29.450 --> 01:01:34.670
&gt;&gt; Cliff Murphy: I'm curious
about definitions of impersonator

01:01:34.670 --> 01:01:39.420
versus re-enactor versus living
historian versus storyteller

01:01:39.420 --> 01:01:42.120
and if there's boundary
of race there.

01:01:42.120 --> 01:01:47.260 position:56%
I think of storytelling associations
in Maryland, for instance

01:01:47.260 --> 01:01:50.850
and Harriet Tubman
impersonators or storytellers

01:01:50.850 --> 01:01:55.070
who impersonate Harriet Tubman.

01:01:55.070 --> 01:01:59.560
I feel like I never get the -- the
term re-enactor is never utilized.

01:01:59.560 --> 01:02:03.690
Does that come into play when
you're dealing with an individual

01:02:03.690 --> 01:02:06.300
as opposed to a generic American?

01:02:06.300 --> 01:02:09.120
I wonder -- another is --

01:02:09.120 --> 01:02:13.260
I know someone who is a
Sally Hemmings impersonator.

01:02:13.260 --> 01:02:16.630
Maybe we've talked about this
where she does - where you can work

01:02:16.630 --> 01:02:19.790
out with Sally, and she'll
share with you her observations

01:02:19.790 --> 01:02:23.200 position:56%
of Thomas Jefferson and her critique
of contemporary [inaudible].

01:02:23.200 --> 01:02:24.500
&gt;&gt; Pravina Shukla: You
can work out with her?

01:02:24.500 --> 01:02:25.800
&gt;&gt; Cliff Murphy: Yes.

01:02:25.800 --> 01:02:27.860
She'll go and do workout
in the gym with you dressed

01:02:27.860 --> 01:02:30.700
as Sally Hemmings and [inaudible]

01:02:30.700 --> 01:02:32.000
&gt;&gt; Pravina Shukla: Why?

01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:34.970
&gt;&gt; Cliff Murphy: It's an
interesting -- it's not my thing.

01:02:34.970 --> 01:02:38.350
I don't do this.

01:02:38.350 --> 01:02:43.070
&gt;&gt; Pravina Shukla: Then how
do you know so much about it?

01:02:43.070 --> 01:02:44.370
&gt;&gt; Cliff Murphy: She's
a friend of mine.

01:02:44.370 --> 01:02:45.670
So I'll share that with you.

01:02:45.670 --> 01:02:48.950
But it's an interesting thing,
right, so confounding perceptions

01:02:48.950 --> 01:02:54.380
of people being a certain way in a
certain period of time and trying

01:02:54.380 --> 01:02:59.330
to kind of expand that
as constance in humanity.

01:02:59.330 --> 01:03:01.690
Anyhow, I'm just curious.

01:03:01.690 --> 01:03:04.430
Are there boundaries
between living historians

01:03:04.430 --> 01:03:08.290
and re-enactors and impersonators?

01:03:08.290 --> 01:03:12.330
&gt;&gt; Pravina Shukla: Again, my
interpretation of this yes.

01:03:12.330 --> 01:03:16.470
So the theater actors in the last
chapter of my book talk about

01:03:16.470 --> 01:03:20.010
"I am this character
only when I am" --

01:03:20.010 --> 01:03:22.090
one of the questions
I ask my actor --

01:03:22.090 --> 01:03:25.570
one of my actor informants was
"When do you become that character?

01:03:25.570 --> 01:03:27.550
When do you stop being you
and become that character?

01:03:27.550 --> 01:03:28.940 position:56%
In the back when you put on the wig?

01:03:28.940 --> 01:03:30.240
When you put on the face?

01:03:30.240 --> 01:03:31.540
When you put on the voice?"

01:03:31.540 --> 01:03:32.890
And she said, "I am
only that character--

01:03:32.890 --> 01:03:36.470
that character only lives
on that stage with that set

01:03:36.470 --> 01:03:38.500
with those other characters there."

01:03:38.500 --> 01:03:39.900
The character is only
going to live" --

01:03:39.900 --> 01:03:44.510
so if you are re-enacting actual
character in a play in a piece

01:03:44.510 --> 01:03:47.910
of fiction, that character
does not live outside

01:03:47.910 --> 01:03:52.620
of that time period created
by William Shakespeare.

01:03:52.620 --> 01:03:54.820
Now, what about Sally Hemmings?

01:03:54.820 --> 01:03:58.570
What if I am Sally
Hemmings at Monticello

01:03:58.570 --> 01:04:01.810
versus Sally Hemmings at the gym?

01:04:01.810 --> 01:04:04.700
Or here? Did she live
in that context?

01:04:04.700 --> 01:04:07.520
So you're really transferring
somebody from a particular context.

01:04:07.520 --> 01:04:09.810
These people are in
Civil War battlefields.

01:04:09.810 --> 01:04:12.980
That General Pickett does
not go to Kroger's with you.

01:04:12.980 --> 01:04:14.680
But he could.

01:04:14.680 --> 01:04:18.410
But the Pickett didn't -- was not
at Kroger's as far as we know.

01:04:18.410 --> 01:04:20.040
But he was at that thing.

01:04:20.040 --> 01:04:24.320
So for some people in terms of
self-definition: "I'm re-enacting

01:04:24.320 --> 01:04:25.990
because I am this character.

01:04:25.990 --> 01:04:28.820
I only know what this
character would have known."

01:04:28.820 --> 01:04:32.920 position:56%
So Sammy Hemmings did not know about
the stairmaster or the life cycle.

01:04:32.920 --> 01:04:34.530
I'm using that example just

01:04:34.530 --> 01:04:37.200
because she wouldn't have known
necessarily about those machines.

01:04:37.200 --> 01:04:40.270
So these are going to say I only
know what this general knew.

01:04:40.270 --> 01:04:42.240
&gt;&gt; Cliff Murphy: So it's also
very much tied to place, right?

01:04:42.240 --> 01:04:43.850
&gt;&gt; Pravina Shukla: Very
much in terms of this,

01:04:43.850 --> 01:04:45.940
and the Williamsburg
people do know beyond

01:04:45.940 --> 01:04:48.110
because it's an educational --

01:04:48.110 --> 01:04:51.620
Williamsburg is a paid
private museum.

01:04:51.620 --> 01:04:53.000
They do know about the cotton gin.

01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:55.080
They do know about
the sewing machine.

01:04:55.080 --> 01:04:56.380
They do know about the
American Civil War.

01:04:56.380 --> 01:04:57.680
They know about Obama.

01:04:57.680 --> 01:04:59.780
They know about all that
stuff, and they'll answer

01:04:59.780 --> 01:05:02.950
and them come back
to 1774 or whatever.

01:05:02.950 --> 01:05:07.280
I think it has to do with location
and the impersonation as much

01:05:07.280 --> 01:05:11.030
as sticking to what that
person would have known.

01:05:11.030 --> 01:05:15.620
So some kind of loose script
in a storytelling event.

01:05:15.620 --> 01:05:18.680
Somebody is going to be the
famous person, Thomas Jefferson,

01:05:18.680 --> 01:05:22.400 position:56%
talking about Tony Morrison's novel.

01:05:22.400 --> 01:05:25.740
He would never have talked
about that in real life.

01:05:25.740 --> 01:05:30.060
So that would be more of a
interpretation versus re-enacting

01:05:30.060 --> 01:05:31.640
because that wouldn't have
happened in real life.

01:05:31.640 --> 01:05:39.320
I think it has to stick
to history to some extent.

01:05:39.320 --> 01:05:40.620
Yes.

01:05:40.620 --> 01:05:42.920
&gt;&gt; Female audience member: I
wonder if there's any acceptable

01:05:50.620 --> 01:06:03.000 position:56%
of other races or ethnic groups that
just really want to be a reenactor.

01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:06.490
For instance, you know, if your
Asian or Hispanic or something

01:06:06.490 --> 01:06:07.790
that really weren't - maybe a few,

01:06:07.790 --> 01:06:09.090
but not very many fighting
during the Civil War.

01:06:09.090 --> 01:06:10.800
Has there been any acceptance
or any interest in that?

01:06:10.800 --> 01:06:12.480
&gt;&gt; Pravina Shukla: Yeah, well
that's an interesting question.

01:06:12.480 --> 01:06:14.780
Some of those people wouldn't have
necessarily been in the Civil War

01:06:14.780 --> 01:06:16.080
but some would have been.

01:06:16.080 --> 01:06:19.210
If you're Irish descent, you
could be one of these Irish troops

01:06:19.210 --> 01:06:21.500
that were in the Civil War.

01:06:21.500 --> 01:06:23.740
I actually have to admit I
don't know enough about --

01:06:23.740 --> 01:06:27.340 position:56%
haven't talked enough to this group
of people which I want to talk to --

01:06:27.340 --> 01:06:30.710
African Americans will re-enact
American Civil War on both sides.

01:06:30.710 --> 01:06:32.570
And there was a group I was
going to pursue and then

01:06:32.570 --> 01:06:33.870
that just never happened.

01:06:33.870 --> 01:06:38.360 position:56%
There was a group in North Carolina,
African Americans who re-enact,

01:06:38.360 --> 01:06:41.670
and that is also something
that what roles --

01:06:41.670 --> 01:06:46.300
do you have to stick to the
actual historical reality

01:06:46.300 --> 01:06:49.250
of when African Americans were
allowed to enlist on both sides

01:06:49.250 --> 01:06:52.830
or can you just do it because
you just like history but

01:06:52.830 --> 01:06:54.590
yet you look different from --

01:06:54.590 --> 01:06:57.940
I think it has to do with
specific units and specific people.

01:06:57.940 --> 01:07:00.270
But I think it's very,
very interesting.

01:07:00.270 --> 01:07:04.340
Something I wish I knew more
about, and I hope to in the future.

01:07:04.340 --> 01:07:05.640
Okay.

01:07:05.640 --> 01:07:06.940
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: Thank you so much.

01:07:06.940 --> 01:07:08.240
&gt;&gt; Pravina Shukla:
Thank you very much.

01:07:08.240 --> 01:07:10.560
Thank you for having me.

01:07:10.560 --> 01:07:14.170
&gt;&gt; This has been a presentation
of the Library of Congress.
