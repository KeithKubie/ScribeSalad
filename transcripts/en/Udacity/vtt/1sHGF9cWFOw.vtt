00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:01.150
Welcome back.

00:00:01.150 --> 00:00:04.720
I hope you're refreshed after importing
your first libGDX project and

00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:08.240
I'm sure you're dying to learn how to
create those sweet particle effects.

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:11.580
Before we get to that, though, we should
start out with some simpler drawing.

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:14.300
So in this level we're first going to
learn a bit about about how the computer

00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:15.740
drawing pipe line works.

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:19.240
With a brief detour into color theory,
and how your eyeballs work.

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:22.480
Then we'll talk about the main
entry point into libGDX games,

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:24.860
the Application Listener Interface.

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:28.500
We'll implement an application listener,
and then use ShapeRenderer to draw some

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:32.509
simple shapes, some pretty flowers and
even some fancy fractals.

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:33.130
Let's get started.
