00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.011
&gt;&gt; MALE: Introduce yourselves, you guys work
on GigaPan.

00:00:07.011 --> 00:00:08.890
&gt;&gt; GIBSON: We do.
&gt;&gt; MALE: If you want to give us a little background

00:00:08.890 --> 00:00:12.300
on what that site is and kind of what it does?
&gt;&gt; GIBSON: Sure, sure. We’ll I’m Rich

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:14.660
Gibson.
&gt;&gt; O'DONNELL: I’m Gabriel O'Donnell.

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:19.890
&gt;&gt; GIBSON: And we both work on the GigaPan
project. GigaPan project was originally a

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:26.450
product of CMU and NASA Ames. Going back in
time it originally came about were we needed

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:31.270
to stitch, Randy Sargent needed to stitch
the images that came from the Mars Exploration

00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:37.110
Rovers, Spirit and Opportunity, and it gave
us an opportunity to see and care about Mars

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:42.360
in a way we never had before. So Randy had
this idea, if we care about Mars, so we can

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:47.140
explore images of it, what if we brought that
technology back to the Earth so we could care

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:53.110
about the Earth. So it became part of the
Global Connections Project and now we have

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:58.500
a robot imager that can take lots of pictures,
stitching software to stitch them together

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:04.970
and the website were people can upload, share,
explore, imitate amazing, brilliant gigapixel

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:07.080
imagery.
&gt;&gt; MALE: Sounds great, that sounds great.

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.930
And you got actually some fairly famous [INDISTINCT]
right now.

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:16.570
&gt;&gt; GIBSON: We do. We do, the most famous is
of the--the Obama inauguration, 30 million

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:19.479
people have seen it.
&gt;&gt; O'DONNELL: Something like it, yeah.

00:01:19.479 --> 00:01:21.780
&gt;&gt; GIBSON: Yeah.
&gt;&gt; O'DONNELL: Probably, probably more, more

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:26.870
traffic than we ever expected to get within
the--within the first two weeks of that pano

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:33.300
going viral. More people had seen that GigaPan
and every other single GigaPan on our site

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:35.610
combined.
&gt;&gt; GIBSON: Yeah, it’s kind of amazing, and

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:41.130
it was his first GigaPan. After he took it,
he stitched it, he called--he said where do

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:45.200
I return this unit? Because it’s interesting
but I don’t think I’ll use it in my regular

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:48.500
photography. I think he has since changed
his mind.

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:51.920
&gt;&gt; MALE: So you guys were actually, also user
[INDISTINCT]?

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:54.990
&gt;&gt; GIBSON: Yes.
&gt;&gt; MALE: That’s right.

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:59.600
&gt;&gt; MALE: So how did that come about?
&gt;&gt; O'DONNELL: So, basically what we realize

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:06.770
is when the Obama pano went viral, our kind
of simply [INDISTINCT], it wasn’t sufficient

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:14.940
that we were, we were consuming--were consuming
way too much of the pipeline at CMU and he--we

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:25.480
really realized that we hadn't distributed--we
had distributed file system and it wasn’t

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:30.239
implemented I think the way we wanted to implement.
We didn’t have full confidence in the ideas

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:38.120
of backup and like ease of access and things
like that. So I actually don’t know who

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:43.090
initiated it, if it was you reaching out or
we reached out to you. But the end result

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:49.959
was that we started using app engine as our
[INDISTINCT]. We move the Obama panos over

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:55.540
and it was really spectacular. It--we went
from taking up, like, and this is at the point

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:59.409
were traffic had already decrease but it still
a lot, we went from like taking up 200 megabits

00:02:59.409 --> 00:03:04.829
a second of CMU’s pipe to like, you know,
zero megabits per second because it was all

00:03:04.829 --> 00:03:09.559
going on to the app engine, which, which led
to the funny thing, I think where, it was,

00:03:09.559 --> 00:03:13.799
it was, I think it was maybe even unexpected
for you guys, maybe the amount of traffic

00:03:13.799 --> 00:03:18.359
because I remember you guys saying, “Okay,
well, turn the switch.” And we turned the

00:03:18.359 --> 00:03:20.469
switch and then two hours later it was like,
whoa.

00:03:20.469 --> 00:03:24.489
&gt;&gt; MALE: Yup, and...
&gt;&gt; O'DONNELL: So app engine held up, I did--it

00:03:24.489 --> 00:03:27.110
held up tremendously.
&gt;&gt; MALE: Yeah.

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:33.069
&gt;&gt; O'DONNELL: We--so one--as a developer,
one of the kind of--and this is, on the fringes

00:03:33.069 --> 00:03:40.359
of the scenes, one of the kind of worries
we had was--you hear rumors about latency

00:03:40.359 --> 00:03:44.079
and maybe they’re exaggerated, you know,
maybe they weren’t initially, we've had

00:03:44.079 --> 00:03:48.589
no problems or whatsoever. And the thing,
the really thing that’s neat with the tile

00:03:48.589 --> 00:03:53.010
touches for our panorama, is that you would
notice, you know, and you would notice pretty

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:56.769
quickly because you have big empty black spaces
in your panorama and we don’t see those.

00:03:56.769 --> 00:04:02.699
&gt;&gt; MALE: That’s excellent. Excellent. So,
you moved over, did you experience any sort

00:04:02.699 --> 00:04:05.760
of challenges moving over to using app engine
for...

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:11.549
&gt;&gt; O'DONNELL: So we’re still, I think we’re
still on the process actually of really optimizing

00:04:11.549 --> 00:04:16.630
and figuring out exactly whether or not we’ve
made the correct optimizations. One of the,

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:22.950
one of the--kind of a hard challenges is,
we went from a system where we could really

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:28.400
rely on less [INDISTINCT] locality because
we’re serving from the file system to the

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:32.740
app engine where that, that’s really, not
really, it’s a different model to kind of

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:37.540
get your cut around. And so it’s--I think
it might be what happens if you are a serial

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:40.540
programmer and you’re beginning to--and
you’re beginning to write parallel code.

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:43.010
Like I suspected it’s actually like a similar
transition.

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:48.071
&gt;&gt; MALE: Okay, great. So, and you guys were
using the Python version of app engine?

00:04:48.071 --> 00:04:51.150
&gt;&gt; O'DONNELL: That’s correct, yeah.
&gt;&gt; MALE: Okay, and you’re previously Python,

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:52.190
Python...?
&gt;&gt; MALE: Yes.

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:58.600
&gt;&gt; MALE: Okay, great. What are these--where
it kind of--what are the other aspects, how

00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:02.390
has the app engine impacted, how you’ve
developed and anything like that, are you—have

00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:07.060
you been working with it long enough that
is actually kind of changed your development

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:10.940
style?
&gt;&gt; O'DONNELL: It’s making us, it’s actually--previously

00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:17.080
what we had, there’s two main developers,
David Holstius is probably, David Holstius

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:22.090
is probably the project lead in general. This
site was originally written in PHP and we

00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:30.750
started moving to Django which is a Python-based
web ORM. And now that we’re moving to app

00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:35.170
engine, so one of the things that--that’s
really nice about app engine is the ability

00:05:35.170 --> 00:05:39.390
to actually download the environment right
on your desktop. Previously what we’re doing

00:05:39.390 --> 00:05:44.660
is we would tab our own kind of shared SVN
repo and we check it out into separate little

00:05:44.660 --> 00:05:50.160
websites. Which one--it's just two developers,
it’s okay because you can communicate as

00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:54.770
if we've been adding developers to the group,
we’ve noticed [INDISTINCT] creeping in and

00:05:54.770 --> 00:05:59.710
the actual ability then the like kind of full
down the app, to work on it locally, like

00:05:59.710 --> 00:06:00.710
with our own set of things and then check
it back in using get--we’re actually using

00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:01.710
get locally but checking it back up for when
we push the changes back at the app engine,

00:06:01.710 --> 00:06:13.740
it’s been a lot easier.
&gt;&gt; MALE: Great. So if you had any advice to

00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:19.730
somebody who was just coming to app engine,
what would it be like the one piece of advice

00:06:19.730 --> 00:06:24.690
you want to hand over to them?
&gt;&gt; O'DONNELL: I would, I would look very strongly

00:06:24.690 --> 00:06:33.740
in the--maybe object optimizations that--how
you need to rewrite your objects, how you--because

00:06:33.740 --> 00:06:39.910
it’s not--chances are if you're coming from
a LAMP development environment, you’ve gotten

00:06:39.910 --> 00:06:45.710
really good at optimizing for [INDISTINCT].
And that’s no longer an issue, and they’re

00:06:45.710 --> 00:06:52.920
new--we’ve got new tricks and new tools
that you have to learn to use and you have

00:06:52.920 --> 00:06:54.890
to learn to use them well. So that, that’s
probably where I recommend developers from

00:06:54.890 --> 00:06:58.150
[INDISTINCT], like leading in to--especially
if they’re porting a legacy site to app

00:06:58.150 --> 00:07:01.101
engine.
&gt;&gt; MALE: All right, that’s great. Well thanks

00:07:01.101 --> 00:07:02.101
guys.
&gt;&gt; GIBSON: Thanks Gil.

00:07:02.101 --> 00:07:03.320
&gt;&gt; MALE: Great having you here.
&gt;&gt; O'DONNELL: Thank you.
