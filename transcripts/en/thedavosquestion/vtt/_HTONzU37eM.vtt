00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.899
&gt;&gt; I'm Peter Levene, I'm the Chairman of Lloyd's,
the insurance marketer

00:00:04.899 --> 00:00:09.820
in London.
I know there's been a lot of talk here, in

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:14.630
the press, and around the
world about the financial problems that have

00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:17.250
happened.
One thing I would like people to say, to know,

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:20.400
and I say this as
Chairman of Lloyd's, the insurance market,

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:23.160
we're not a bank.
The insurance market is the insurance industry

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:25.999
has come out of this
pretty well.

00:00:25.999 --> 00:00:28.820
We're in good shape.
We were throughout the period.

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:32.500
And before anybody says AIG, I think you'll
find that most of AIG's

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:37.039
problems came from their financial products
business, not their

00:00:37.039 --> 00:00:41.570
insurance business.
But I think it's easy to demonize people,

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:44.579
and quite a number of us need
demonizing.

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:49.149
But we must be sure that the baby doesn't
get thrown out with the bath

00:00:49.149 --> 00:00:53.140
water.
Everybody the whole world needs a good, strong,

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:57.620
able financial system
which we had until 3 or 4 years ago.

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:01.829
And it's up to the industry.
It's up to governments and regulators to get

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:06.840
it right.
And I think it's up to everybody else to impress

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:10.470
on them they need to
get it right, but without demonizing them

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:12.630
and trying to help them
through it.

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:17.690
And trying to explain that they need good,
reasonable financial

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:22.110
services which they need either for personal
life or for their

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:25.360
businesses.
And I think people need to try at least to

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:29.530
work together on it we might
get a better outcome.

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:29.830
Thank you.
