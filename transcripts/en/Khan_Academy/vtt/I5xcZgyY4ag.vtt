00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.430
- [Voiceover] Which number line shows 47 plus 22?

00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:06.308
Let's see, in this first number line we're

00:00:06.309 --> 00:00:11.184
starting at 47, then we add 20 to get to 67.

00:00:11.184 --> 00:00:14.350
And then we add two to get to 69.

00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:16.193
So if you add 20, and then you're adding two,

00:00:16.193 --> 00:00:17.706
you're adding 22.

00:00:17.706 --> 00:00:19.477
So this one seems right.

00:00:19.477 --> 00:00:22.260
So let's see why these choices don't seem right.

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.442
So this one, we add two to get to 49

00:00:24.443 --> 00:00:26.950
and then two more to get to 51.

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:28.560
Well this isn't adding 22.

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:31.389
This adding two plus two, this is adding four.

00:00:31.389 --> 00:00:34.287
To add 22, you have to add 20 and then two.

00:00:34.287 --> 00:00:36.342
And this choice right over here,

00:00:36.342 --> 00:00:39.163
we are adding 20 and then we're adding two,

00:00:39.163 --> 00:00:43.169
but we're not starting at 47, we're starting at 74.

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:46.303
So this is 74 plus 22, so I definitely feel good

00:00:46.303 --> 00:00:48.806
about that choice right over there.

00:00:48.806 --> 00:00:52.470
Let's do a few more examples.

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:56.190
Which number line shows 93 minus 76?

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:59.876
So let's see, in all of these choices, we're starting at 93.

00:00:59.877 --> 00:01:04.296
Here, in this first choice we subtract seven and then six.

00:01:04.296 --> 00:01:07.696
But it's subtracting 76, you want to subtract 70.

00:01:07.696 --> 00:01:09.576
And then you want to subtract six, not just seven.

00:01:09.576 --> 00:01:11.803
So I don't like this first choice.

00:01:11.804 --> 00:01:16.253
Here we subtract 60, and then we subtract seven.

00:01:16.253 --> 00:01:19.730
But that's subtracting 67, not 76.

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:21.279
We gotta subtract seven tens.

00:01:21.279 --> 00:01:23.664
Seven tens, and then six ones.

00:01:23.664 --> 00:01:27.110
So here we're subtracting seven tens, we're subtracting 70.

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:29.794
And then we are subtracting six ones.

00:01:29.794 --> 00:01:33.493
So that's definitely going to be the right choice.

00:01:33.493 --> 00:01:35.580
So let's see, maybe

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:38.539
maybe one more just for fun.

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:41.600
Which number line shows 12 plus 87?

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:43.824
So all of these start off at 12,

00:01:43.824 --> 00:01:46.297
and we're gonna want to add 80 and then add 7.

00:01:46.297 --> 00:01:48.570
Eight tens and seven ones.

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:50.797
And let's see, this one adds 80

00:01:50.798 --> 00:01:52.604
and then we add seven, so yep.

00:01:52.604 --> 00:01:56.770
Feel good about that one right over there.
