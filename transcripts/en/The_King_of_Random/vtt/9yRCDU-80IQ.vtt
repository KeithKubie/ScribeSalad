00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:04.029
If you're looking for a safe place to hide
something precious, the obvious choice would

00:00:04.029 --> 00:00:09.870
be in a safe. And it's probably just as obvious,
to the criminals who wanna steal your stuff.

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:14.009
Sometimes the best place to hide something,
is where people least expect it. So in this

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:18.549
project we're making a super secret safe,
that only you know about.

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:42.960
For this project you'll need one of these
extra long, electrical gang boxes, made for

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:48.579
existing walls. You'll also need a blank wall
plate, like this. Now search around your house

00:00:48.579 --> 00:00:53.449
for a clean section of wall, and use a stud
finder, to locate an area between the studs.

00:00:53.449 --> 00:00:57.739
When you've found a spot that works, measure
a height that matches the outlets nearby,

00:00:57.739 --> 00:01:02.280
and add half and inch. Now line up the mark
with the bottom left corner of the box, and

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:06.970
trace around the sides. This is where you'll
need to cut into the wall. Go ahead and stick

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:11.530
an envelope under the markings, and select
your cutting tool of choice. You can see that

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:15.690
when you begin cutting into the sheetrock,
the envelope catches the dust, reducing the

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:20.440
mess that you'll have to clean up later. It's
important to cut carefully, and with shallow

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:23.690
strokes, because there could be electrical
wires behind the wall, and you don't want

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:28.020
to cut them by accident. When it's all cut
out, you should find that your blue box pushes

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:32.490
in perfectly, and rests flat against the wall.
When you adjust the screws in the corners,

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:37.390
you can see that it tightens the flaps at
the back, securing the box tight to the wall.

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:41.880
At this point you can start loading your safe,
with something important. Perhaps some stamps

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:47.160
you want to save? A set of spare keys maybe?
..what about emergency ammunition? Whatever

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:52.660
you put in there, when it's all tucked away,
simply add the cover plate, and screw it together.

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:56.710
Chances are, no one will ever guess there's
anything hidden inside. If you wanna go one

00:01:56.710 --> 00:02:01.290
step further, try pushing some furniture in
front of the cover, because out of sight,

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:05.340
means out of mind. Now, if the time comes
where you need to open your safe, but you

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:10.569
don't have a screwdriver, no problem. Just
use the prongs from a plug. The blades fit

00:02:10.569 --> 00:02:15.439
perfectly into the screw-heads, allowing you
full, and easy access. Now there are plenty

00:02:15.439 --> 00:02:20.019
of modifications you can make to this thing.
For example, if you plan on using this a lot,

00:02:20.019 --> 00:02:23.999
and can't be bothered, with unscrewing it
every time, try drilling out the screw holes

00:02:23.999 --> 00:02:29.090
with a 9/64" drill bit. Then add a dab of
super glue, to where the screws meet the cover

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:33.389
plate. This way the screws will be held fast
in place, and now you can just line up the

00:02:33.389 --> 00:02:38.379
holes, and press it together, in an instant.
If you want this to blend better with the

00:02:38.379 --> 00:02:41.969
surroundings, try adding an outlet to the
front of the box, and a finishing plate over

00:02:41.969 --> 00:02:46.480
that. Now your secret safe looks like all
the other outlets in your house. Have you

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:51.810
got so much stuff that you need a bigger safe?
Try upgrading, to a double-gang. This gives

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:57.389
you nearly twice the storage space, and installs
just as easily as the others. As a final thought,

00:02:57.389 --> 00:03:01.799
if you don't want to spend the $3 on materials,
or cut holes in your walls, just look for

00:03:01.799 --> 00:03:06.439
one of these cable jacks around the house.
The cable's protected, there's plenty of space

00:03:06.439 --> 00:03:11.469
inside, and it's a great place for hiding
things, like your list of computer passwords.

00:03:11.469 --> 00:03:15.310
Not only is this option free, but chances
are, you've already got them all over the

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:20.969
house. Well now you know how to make an easy,
secret safe, for hiding important stuff. If

00:03:20.969 --> 00:03:22.889
you liked this project, perhaps you'll like
some 

00:03:22.889 --> 00:03:26.809
of my others. Check them
