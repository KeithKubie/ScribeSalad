the training and also the way of
 

00:00:19.690 --> 00:00:23.640

actually carrying out the the profession

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:23.650
actually carrying out the the profession
 

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:25.500
actually carrying out the the profession
is quite different between a scientist

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:25.510
is quite different between a scientist
 

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:27.870
is quite different between a scientist
and a doctor understandably so that's

00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:27.880
and a doctor understandably so that's
 

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:30.179

not a criticism of either sigh it's just

what do we do about that what we have to

00:00:44.369 --> 00:00:44.379
what do we do about that what we have to
 

00:00:44.379 --> 00:00:47.189
what do we do about that what we have to
do about that its first of all recognize

the problem and analyze it and then

secondly we have to deal with it we have

secondly we have to deal with it we have
 

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:53.610
secondly we have to deal with it we have
to get the two individuals types of

differences to see where they're coming
 

00:00:57.220 --> 00:01:00.119

from to realize why they have differing
 

00:01:00.129 --> 00:01:02.820
from to realize why they have differing
views and how they can perhaps work best

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:02.830

together do you think any of us in the

together do you think any of us in the
 

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:06.300
together do you think any of us in the
bio medical profession take the

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:06.310
bio medical profession take the
 

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:07.980
bio medical profession take the

like that we don't but this is something
 

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:15.990
like that we don't but this is something
where we really need like in the future

have I applied it successfully in in my

own work my own work has tended not to
 

00:01:23.109 --> 00:01:25.950

been exposed with my own research in

been exposed with my own research in
that way but I have seen it many many

that way but I have seen it many many
 

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:33.690
that way but I have seen it many many
times in my colleagues and because I've

times in my colleagues and because I've
 

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:36.810

my best to at the very least get mutual

my best to at the very least get mutual
respect on both sides of that divide but

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:44.740
respect on both sides of that divide but
 

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:46.230
respect on both sides of that divide but
I actually think we need a much more

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:46.240
I actually think we need a much more
 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:48.120
I actually think we need a much more
professional approach that problem and I

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:48.130
professional approach that problem and I
 

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:50.639
professional approach that problem and I
would say it's key for greater success

00:01:50.639 --> 00:01:50.649
would say it's key for greater success
 

00:01:50.649 --> 00:01:54.960
would say it's key for greater success
in this area

often not given the air time it should

often not given the air time it should

earn by the scientists themselves
 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:05.310

because it's quite a difficult subject

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:05.320
because it's quite a difficult subject
 

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:08.100
because it's quite a difficult subject
to study and often requires very long

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:08.110
to study and often requires very long
 

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:11.340
to study and often requires very long
term trials sometimes over decades with

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:11.350
term trials sometimes over decades with
 

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:13.800
term trials sometimes over decades with
large numbers of individuals before you

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:13.810
large numbers of individuals before you
 

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:17.040
large numbers of individuals before you
can get good statistical results so it

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:17.050
can get good statistical results so it
 

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:19.050
can get good statistical results so it
does sort of doesn't fit in well with a

does sort of doesn't fit in well with a
 

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:21.150
does sort of doesn't fit in well with a
normal scientific career if you've got a

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:21.160
normal scientific career if you've got a

PhD or four years say knowing that

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:23.680
PhD or four years say knowing that
 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:25.080
PhD or four years say knowing that
you're participating in a study that

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:25.090
you're participating in a study that
 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:27.720
you're participating in a study that
takes 20 years to carry out it just

takes 20 years to carry out it just
 

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:29.640
takes 20 years to carry out it just
doesn't fit so it's quite difficult to

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:29.650
doesn't fit so it's quite difficult to
 

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:33.120
doesn't fit so it's quite difficult to
actually do good working some in some

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:33.130
actually do good working some in some
 

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:35.880
actually do good working some in some
cases in this sort of area and it's also

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:35.890
cases in this sort of area and it's also
 

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:38.910
cases in this sort of area and it's also
a very complicated issue and we all know

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:38.920
a very complicated issue and we all know
 

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:41.370
a very complicated issue and we all know
of individuals who have smoked 40

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:41.380
of individuals who have smoked 40
 

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:44.670
of individuals who have smoked 40
cigarettes a day who lived till 90 but

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:44.680
cigarettes a day who lived till 90 but
 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:46.530
cigarettes a day who lived till 90 but
of course we happen to know that if you

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:46.540
of course we happen to know that if you
 

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:48.510
of course we happen to know that if you
do smoke 40 cigarettes a day on average

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:48.520
do smoke 40 cigarettes a day on average
 

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:51.150
do smoke 40 cigarettes a day on average
in the population and your life

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:51.160
in the population and your life
 

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:54.810
in the population and your life
expectancy can be reduced 15 or 20 years

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:54.820
expectancy can be reduced 15 or 20 years
 

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:56.730
expectancy can be reduced 15 or 20 years
I forget exactly the number so it's a

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:56.740
I forget exactly the number so it's a
 

00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:59.370
I forget exactly the number so it's a
hugely negative impact upon your health

00:02:59.370 --> 00:02:59.380
hugely negative impact upon your health
 

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:01.710
hugely negative impact upon your health
even though certain individuals may

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:01.720
even though certain individuals may
 

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:04.770
even though certain individuals may
actually survive that so understanding

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:04.780
actually survive that so understanding
 

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:09.949
actually survive that so understanding
the interaction between the impact of

00:03:09.949 --> 00:03:09.959
the interaction between the impact of
 

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:14.820
the interaction between the impact of
environment with with genetics I think

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:14.830
environment with with genetics I think
 

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:16.610
environment with with genetics I think
it's really crucial in getting good

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:16.620
it's really crucial in getting good
 

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:19.830
it's really crucial in getting good
preventive advice out there and but this

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:19.840
preventive advice out there and but this
 

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:22.560
preventive advice out there and but this
makes it these epidemiological studies

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:22.570
makes it these epidemiological studies
 

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:24.090
makes it these epidemiological studies
that's population-based studies as

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:24.100
that's population-based studies as
 

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:25.590
that's population-based studies as
they're called even more difficult

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:25.600
they're called even more difficult
 

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:27.780
they're called even more difficult
because you're not only then trying to

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:27.790
because you're not only then trying to
 

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:30.210
because you're not only then trying to
simply control for whether an individual

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:30.220
simply control for whether an individual
 

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:32.930
simply control for whether an individual
is exposed to a particular environmental

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:32.940
is exposed to a particular environmental
 

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:35.850
is exposed to a particular environmental
impact such as the Sun or tobacco or

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:35.860
impact such as the Sun or tobacco or
 

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:37.530
impact such as the Sun or tobacco or
water but which is difficult enough in

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:37.540
water but which is difficult enough in
 

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:40.800
water but which is difficult enough in
itself but you're also saying we need to

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:40.810
itself but you're also saying we need to
 

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:42.960
itself but you're also saying we need to
subdivide the population up according to

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:42.970
subdivide the population up according to
 

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:45.120
subdivide the population up according to
their genetic makeup to get good results

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:45.130
their genetic makeup to get good results
 

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:47.670
their genetic makeup to get good results
and we may not even quite know how to

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:47.680
and we may not even quite know how to
 

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:50.220
and we may not even quite know how to
divide them up and what which particular

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:50.230
divide them up and what which particular
 

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:53.009
divide them up and what which particular
variants of genes are important so these

00:03:53.009 --> 00:03:53.019
variants of genes are important so these
 

00:03:53.019 --> 00:03:56.280
variants of genes are important so these
are difficult problems but we are

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:56.290
are difficult problems but we are
 

00:03:56.290 --> 00:03:58.050
are difficult problems but we are
beginning to get into the territory

00:03:58.050 --> 00:03:58.060
beginning to get into the territory
 

00:03:58.060 --> 00:03:59.850
beginning to get into the territory
where we can perhaps address them and

00:03:59.850 --> 00:03:59.860
where we can perhaps address them and
 

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:03.150
where we can perhaps address them and
maybe that will help us put to rest a

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:03.160
maybe that will help us put to rest a
 

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:05.570

screen genetics environment well but I

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:10.350
screen genetics environment well but I
