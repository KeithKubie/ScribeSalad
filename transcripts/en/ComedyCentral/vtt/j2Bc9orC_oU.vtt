Are you shitting me?

And they were like, "Yeah, the
Nazis were looking for her."

I'm nursing
one of the worst hangovers

[laughter]

00:01:35.661 --> 00:01:39.466
I'm not--I'm not--I'm not, like,

00:01:41.701 --> 00:01:42.869
[laughter]

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:45.938
I'm not good with facts
and stuff.

00:01:45.938 --> 00:01:47.607
Like, I was talking to someone
the other day,

00:01:47.607 --> 00:01:49.808
and I realized I'd always
thought Anne Frank

00:01:49.808 --> 00:01:51.844
and Helen Keller
were the same person.

00:01:51.844 --> 00:01:55.147
[laughter]

00:01:55.147 --> 00:01:56.949
Like, well into my 20s.

00:01:56.949 --> 00:01:58.350
[laughter]

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:00.119
Do you know where I found out?

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:02.821
At the Anne Frank house.

00:02:02.821 --> 00:02:08.161
Do you have any idea wh--I--
I went--okay.

00:02:08.161 --> 00:02:10.830
I backpacked through Europe when
I was 22 with these four guys.

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:12.631
Three are lawyers, so I can't
say their names.

00:02:12.631 --> 00:02:15.401
The other one's named Wicho.

00:02:15.401 --> 00:02:16.903
And these guys were just fucking
nerds.

00:02:16.903 --> 00:02:18.471
The whole time we were
backpacking, they were like,

00:02:18.471 --> 00:02:20.473
"You want to go to, like,
the Louvre?

00:02:20.473 --> 00:02:22.041
"Do you want to see David?

00:02:22.041 --> 00:02:23.575
"Do you want--
we should take a class

00:02:23.575 --> 00:02:25.644
"and learn about
how they cut diamonds

00:02:25.644 --> 00:02:27.647
so when we get engaged
we can have"--

00:02:27.647 --> 00:02:30.083
I'm like, "I...

00:02:30.083 --> 00:02:33.352
"what the fuck is wrong with
you guys?

00:02:33.352 --> 00:02:35.220
"We--we're here to bang Swedish
chicks.

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:38.157
That's it. Like, are you out of
your minds?"

00:02:38.157 --> 00:02:40.059
And then one day they're like,
"Hey, do you want to go to the

00:02:40.059 --> 00:02:41.160
Anne Frank house?"

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:44.497
And I lit up.
I was like, "Fuck yes."

00:02:44.497 --> 00:02:46.232
And they were like,
"Wow, you seem really excited."

00:02:46.232 --> 00:02:48.000
And I was like,
"No, we'll get a bag of weed,

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.569
and we'll laugh our dicks off."

00:02:49.569 --> 00:02:53.239
[laughter]

00:02:53.239 --> 00:02:54.673
And they're like, "Really?"

00:02:54.673 --> 00:02:56.409
I go, "Yeah, I've been hearing
jokes about this girl

00:02:56.409 --> 00:02:57.944
my whole life."

00:02:57.944 --> 00:03:00.179
[laughter]

00:03:00.179 --> 00:03:03.082
"We'll get high, put a plunger
in the toilet."

00:03:03.082 --> 00:03:05.084
[laughs]

00:03:05.084 --> 00:03:07.553
And they were like, "What?"

00:03:07.553 --> 00:03:08.955
I go, "Do you get to go
into the house?"

00:03:08.955 --> 00:03:10.756
And they were like,
"Yeah, you can go see the closet

00:03:10.756 --> 00:03:11.891
they kept her in," and I go,
"They kept her

00:03:11.891 --> 00:03:13.426
in a fucking closet?"

00:03:13.426 --> 00:03:17.697
[laughter]

00:03:17.697 --> 00:03:19.798
Are you shitting me?

00:03:19.798 --> 00:03:21.601
And they were like, "Yeah, the
Nazis were looking for her."

00:03:21.601 --> 00:03:23.102
I go, "The fucking Nazis were
looking for her?"

00:03:23.102 --> 00:03:24.570
[laughter]

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:27.239
"How did they not put this
in the movie?

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:28.941
How did the Nazis not find..."

00:03:28.941 --> 00:03:30.776
[babbling incoherently]

00:03:30.776 --> 00:03:34.247
[laughter]

00:03:34.247 --> 00:03:36.215
So I get excited.
I get a bag of weed.

00:03:36.215 --> 00:03:39.118
And I'm like, "I can't wait to
go to the Anne Frank house."

00:03:39.118 --> 00:03:40.953
[laughter]

00:03:40.953 --> 00:03:44.123
I'm, like, beaming,
I'm so pumped up.

00:03:44.123 --> 00:03:45.458
[laughter]

00:03:45.458 --> 00:03:49.128
On our walk to the Anne Frank
house in Amsterdam,

00:03:49.128 --> 00:03:51.797
we pass by a sign that says,

00:03:51.797 --> 00:03:55.968
"Live sex. Live sex. Live sex.
Flying dildos."

00:03:55.968 --> 00:03:58.003
[laughter]

00:03:58.003 --> 00:04:01.140
And I'm like, "All right,
suck a silent dick, Anne Frank."

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:03.176
[laughter]

00:04:03.176 --> 00:04:06.078
"We're going to see flying
dildos."

00:04:06.078 --> 00:04:09.315
We can--well, what are you gonna
pick, culture

00:04:09.315 --> 00:04:10.483
or the Anne Frank house?

00:04:10.483 --> 00:04:11.584
I'm going with culture.

00:04:11.584 --> 00:04:13.152
[laughter]

00:04:13.152 --> 00:04:14.921
So I get us tickets.

00:04:14.921 --> 00:04:16.088
We all go in.

00:04:16.088 --> 00:04:17.823
Has anybody ever been
to a live sex show?

00:04:17.823 --> 00:04:19.292
- Whoo.

00:04:19.292 --> 00:04:21.527
- One guy in the back.
Perfect.

00:04:21.527 --> 00:04:22.861
It's aggressive.

00:04:22.861 --> 00:04:24.297
It's a lot creepier
than you'd ever think.

00:04:24.297 --> 00:04:26.932
See, here's the problem
with a live sex show:

00:04:26.932 --> 00:04:29.268
every show you go to
elicits a response.

00:04:29.268 --> 00:04:30.670
When you come to this show,
you know to laugh.

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:32.805
When you go to see music,
you get inspired.

00:04:32.805 --> 00:04:34.540
But when you go to
a live sex show,

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:37.543
the only response
is to creep people out.

00:04:37.543 --> 00:04:39.812
Just like,
"Oh, maybe I'll get hard."

00:04:39.812 --> 00:04:42.848
[low laughter]

00:04:42.848 --> 00:04:44.350
So we go in.
We sit down.

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:45.851
It's as intimate as this.

00:04:45.851 --> 00:04:48.320
And we light a joint, get to
know some of the other fellas,

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:49.989
like-minded gentlemen.

00:04:49.989 --> 00:04:52.525
[laughter]

00:04:52.525 --> 00:04:54.827
First woman comes up,
no fanfare,

00:04:54.827 --> 00:04:56.829
no intro music,
not even that hot.

00:04:56.829 --> 00:04:58.798
She's like a sex show six.

00:04:58.798 --> 00:05:00.633
[laughter]

00:05:00.633 --> 00:05:02.835
Comes up--
she definitely has another job.

00:05:02.835 --> 00:05:05.004
Like, trust me.

00:05:05.004 --> 00:05:06.205
It's this intimate.

00:05:06.205 --> 00:05:08.207
It needs to be ex--
we are this close

00:05:08.207 --> 00:05:10.576
and she just starts
oil-rigging herself.

00:05:10.576 --> 00:05:11.977
Just wha--no.

00:05:11.977 --> 00:05:13.679
Listen, I'm not big
into foreplay,

00:05:13.679 --> 00:05:16.916
but total lack of foreplay
looks a lot like assault, okay?

00:05:16.916 --> 00:05:17.917
[laughter]

00:05:17.917 --> 00:05:19.552
And she is going to town,

00:05:19.552 --> 00:05:22.488
and we're making the same look,
just, "Ohh-ohh-ohh,"

00:05:22.488 --> 00:05:25.157
which she confuses for,
"Oh, I guess they can't see,"

00:05:25.157 --> 00:05:27.693
and just goes back to performing
her gynecological exam

00:05:27.693 --> 00:05:29.361
on herself.

00:05:29.361 --> 00:05:31.029
Now, I have a problem
with silence,

00:05:31.029 --> 00:05:33.566
so I immediately start
talking to her.

00:05:33.566 --> 00:05:35.067
[laughter]

00:05:35.067 --> 00:05:37.903
And I'm like,
"Do you speak English?"

00:05:37.903 --> 00:05:39.071
She's like, "No."

00:05:39.071 --> 00:05:40.606
I was like, "Fuck.

00:05:40.606 --> 00:05:43.742
Uh, you're doing
a really good job."

00:05:43.742 --> 00:05:45.077
She was like, "Oh, thank you."

00:05:45.077 --> 00:05:47.746
And I go,
"Do you do flying dildos?"

00:05:47.746 --> 00:05:49.749
And she's like, "No."

00:05:49.749 --> 00:05:51.049
And I was like...
[sighs] "Great."

00:05:51.049 --> 00:05:52.918
Five minutes.
Five minutes she does this.

00:05:52.918 --> 00:05:54.753
Five minutes,
just goes to town on herself.

00:05:54.753 --> 00:05:58.691
Just--it gets aggre--by the end,
we're like,

00:05:58.691 --> 00:06:02.027
now we're learning shit
about the woman's anatomy.

00:06:02.027 --> 00:06:03.696
We're like,
"That's her urethra I think.

00:06:03.696 --> 00:06:05.931
That's amazing."

00:06:05.931 --> 00:06:08.768
She gets done.
We give her a golf clap.

00:06:08.768 --> 00:06:11.938
[laughter]

00:06:11.938 --> 00:06:15.141
Two girls come on stage, and,
now, if this girl was all song,

00:06:15.141 --> 00:06:16.241
no dance,
these girls were all dance,

00:06:16.241 --> 00:06:17.242
no song.

00:06:17.242 --> 00:06:18.711
A lot of foreplay.

00:06:18.711 --> 00:06:20.212
You can't walk backwards
in a story.

00:06:20.212 --> 00:06:22.915
Like, I had to stop and go,
"Ladies, ladies,

00:06:22.915 --> 00:06:24.750
"we just watched
a woman fist herself.

00:06:24.750 --> 00:06:27.286
"Like, let's cut to
the pink meat, okay?

00:06:27.286 --> 00:06:29.889
Like"--they're, like,
making out.

00:06:29.889 --> 00:06:31.257
And now I'm the spokesman.

00:06:31.257 --> 00:06:32.892
Someone's like, "Can you get
them to hurry it up?"

00:06:32.892 --> 00:06:34.259
And I'm like, "Sure."

00:06:34.259 --> 00:06:36.095
I go, "Do you guys do
flying dildos?"

00:06:36.095 --> 00:06:37.096
And they're like, "No."

00:06:37.096 --> 00:06:38.264
I was like, "Okay.
Next."

00:06:38.264 --> 00:06:39.631
And they're like, "Huh?"

00:06:39.631 --> 00:06:40.666
And we're like,
"We're good.

00:06:40.666 --> 00:06:41.834
We've seen what you have
to offer."

00:06:41.834 --> 00:06:43.769
They leave.
Then--

00:06:43.769 --> 00:06:45.304
[laughter]

00:06:45.304 --> 00:06:46.906
A guy and a girl come out.

00:06:46.906 --> 00:06:48.908
Now, this is where
it gets creepy.

00:06:48.908 --> 00:06:50.075
I'm not a huge feminist,

00:06:50.075 --> 00:06:52.111
but I believe
in women's rights, okay?

00:06:52.111 --> 00:06:54.279
And this guy just starts
doing crowd work.

00:06:54.279 --> 00:06:56.081
He's not even
incorporating her in.

00:06:56.081 --> 00:06:58.283
It's like an improv team
where she sits off to the side,

00:06:58.283 --> 00:07:00.920
like, fucking one of Jeff
Dunham's dummies, just...

00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:02.822
[laughter]

00:07:02.822 --> 00:07:04.323
And he's like,
"Aww, you guys"--

00:07:04.323 --> 00:07:06.325
this--by the way, this is
exactly what it feels like.

00:07:06.325 --> 00:07:07.927
I want you to feel it.

00:07:07.927 --> 00:07:10.496
"You guys ready to see me
fuck, huh?"

00:07:10.496 --> 00:07:12.831
[laughter]

00:07:12.831 --> 00:07:14.600
"You want to see me fuck this
shit, man?

00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:16.101
I fuck it good."

00:07:16.101 --> 00:07:19.205
It's creeping me out,
and it's assaulting my morals.

00:07:19.205 --> 00:07:20.439
[laughter]

00:07:20.439 --> 00:07:22.441
And I lean over to my friends,
and I go,

00:07:22.441 --> 00:07:24.677
"We should have just gone
to the Anne Frank house."

00:07:24.677 --> 00:07:26.312
[laughter]

00:07:26.312 --> 00:07:27.813
Which pisses this guy off.

00:07:27.813 --> 00:07:30.783
He goes, "Oh, don't bring up
Anne Frank in this room, man."

00:07:30.783 --> 00:07:33.018
And I go, "What? Fucking wish
I was Anne Frank right now

00:07:33.018 --> 00:07:34.487
so I didn't have to see this."

00:07:34.487 --> 00:07:37.490
[laughter]

00:07:37.490 --> 00:07:40.393
[applause]

00:07:43.496 --> 00:07:45.031
And then he starts
arguing with me,

00:07:45.031 --> 00:07:47.032
but he's arguing with me
and getting his dick hard.

00:07:47.032 --> 00:07:48.033
Like...

00:07:48.033 --> 00:07:50.002
[laughter]

00:07:50.002 --> 00:07:52.037
Like, it's such a--like,
he's, like, pulling it going,

00:07:52.037 --> 00:07:53.839
"Oh, man, don't worry.
It gets bigger."

00:07:53.839 --> 00:07:56.208
I'm like, "Not on my watch
it doesn't."

00:07:56.208 --> 00:07:57.810
And I start heckling his dick.

00:07:57.810 --> 00:07:58.910
I'm like,
"Think about your mom,"

00:07:58.910 --> 00:08:01.581
and he's like,
"Hey, fuck you, buddy."

00:08:01.581 --> 00:08:02.848
I go,
"Do you have any sisters?"

00:08:02.848 --> 00:08:05.150
He's like, "Hey, not now, man.
Not now."

00:08:05.150 --> 00:08:06.585
I go, "We should just go
to Anne Frank."

00:08:06.585 --> 00:08:08.054
And he's like, "Fuck you,"

00:08:08.054 --> 00:08:11.056
and he storms off, and now the
lunatics are running the asylum,

00:08:11.056 --> 00:08:12.324
and I'm their fucking leader.

00:08:12.324 --> 00:08:14.894
I'm their--I'm like their
Rosa Tubbsman.

00:08:14.894 --> 00:08:16.362
Not fucking Rosa Tubbsman.

00:08:16.362 --> 00:08:18.764
[laughter]

00:08:18.764 --> 00:08:20.065
God damn it.

00:08:20.065 --> 00:08:23.402
By the way, I am neither
Rosa Parks or Harriet Tubman.

00:08:23.402 --> 00:08:24.837
[laughter]

00:08:24.837 --> 00:08:26.272
Right--right--

00:08:26.272 --> 00:08:27.406
[laughter]

00:08:27.406 --> 00:08:28.740
[laughs]

00:08:28.740 --> 00:08:32.244
I don't know--right now--
right now in heaven,

00:08:32.244 --> 00:08:36.014
Rosa Parks, Harriet Tubman,
Helen Keller,

00:08:36.014 --> 00:08:38.451
and Anne Frank are going,
"What the fuck is this guy

00:08:38.451 --> 00:08:41.253
doing to our names?"

00:08:41.253 --> 00:08:43.522
Helen Keller's like...
[babbling incoherently]

00:08:43.522 --> 00:08:46.425
[laughter]

00:08:48.093 --> 00:08:52.431
So I'm their Rosa Tubbsman.

00:08:52.431 --> 00:08:54.767
I'm fucking--
I'm leading the--

00:08:54.767 --> 00:08:56.369
fucking--

00:08:56.369 --> 00:08:58.304
if I--if you didn't think
I was stupid

00:08:58.304 --> 00:08:59.905
when I started
this story...

00:08:59.905 --> 00:09:02.808
[laughter]

00:09:04.243 --> 00:09:07.113
I'm leading the charge.

00:09:07.113 --> 00:09:10.115
And I'm, like, I'm fucking
pulling out old high school

00:09:10.115 --> 00:09:14.086
chants, like, "We put our hands
up high, our feet down low.

00:09:14.086 --> 00:09:15.621
"We want flying dildos.

00:09:15.621 --> 00:09:17.223
"Flying dildos.

00:09:17.223 --> 00:09:18.557 line:92%
"Flying dildos.

00:09:18.557 --> 00:09:20.092
Hey, fellas."
"Yeah?"

00:09:20.092 --> 00:09:22.128
"Hey, fellas."
"Yeah?"

00:09:22.128 --> 00:09:23.128
"We want?"
"Yeah?"

00:09:23.128 --> 00:09:25.965
"Flying dildos, yeah."

00:09:25.965 --> 00:09:29.101
They send out some girl to calm
us down and we boo her offstage.

00:09:29.101 --> 00:09:30.169
We're like,
"Get the fuck out, bitch.

00:09:30.169 --> 00:09:31.804
"We only want...

00:09:31.804 --> 00:09:33.004
"flying dildos!

00:09:33.004 --> 00:09:35.007
You heard us."
And now--then there's--okay.

00:09:35.007 --> 00:09:37.977
Then--let's fucking kill
this beer.

00:09:37.977 --> 00:09:39.244
[low laughter]

00:09:39.244 --> 00:09:40.278
- Whoo!

00:09:40.278 --> 00:09:41.279
- Get it, machine.

00:09:41.279 --> 00:09:42.615
- I'm hitting it hard as fuck.

00:09:42.615 --> 00:09:46.252
[laughter]

00:09:46.252 --> 00:09:50.322
Woman comes out, German woman,
six feet tall,

00:09:50.322 --> 00:09:54.759
thigh-high leather boots,
biker's cap, medicine bag,

00:09:54.759 --> 00:09:57.295
plops it on the stool, and goes,

00:09:57.295 --> 00:10:01.433
"Gentlemen, please, calm down.

00:10:01.433 --> 00:10:03.301
I am the flying dildos."

00:10:03.301 --> 00:10:06.372
And the place
goes fucking bananas.

00:10:06.372 --> 00:10:09.508
It looks like the control room
in NASA when Apollo 13 landed.

00:10:09.508 --> 00:10:11.343
Like, "Oh, we did it!

00:10:11.343 --> 00:10:12.444
We did it!"

00:10:12.444 --> 00:10:15.014
[laughter]

00:10:15.014 --> 00:10:19.785
She goes, "Stop, I will need one
volunteer from the audience,"

00:10:19.785 --> 00:10:22.154
and these assholes look at me
like, "You're up, numbnuts."

00:10:22.154 --> 00:10:23.355
[laughter]

00:10:23.355 --> 00:10:26.224
I fucking get up onstage,
and I am so excited

00:10:26.224 --> 00:10:27.659
that I've brought about change.

00:10:27.659 --> 00:10:30.496
I feel like I've accomplished
something in my life.

00:10:30.496 --> 00:10:33.298
I'm literally--
look at my constituents like,

00:10:33.298 --> 00:10:34.900
"You said you wanted change!"

00:10:34.900 --> 00:10:38.971
I--I didn't say that, probably,
but I was like, "Fuck"--

00:10:38.971 --> 00:10:39.971
whatever I said.

00:10:39.971 --> 00:10:41.540
"I'm Rosa Tubbsman!"
And--

00:10:41.540 --> 00:10:43.476
[laughter]

00:10:43.476 --> 00:10:46.378
I don't even realize her putting
a handcuff on me,

00:10:46.378 --> 00:10:48.413
and when the second one goes on,
I go,

00:10:48.413 --> 00:10:51.383
"Hey, maybe we should talk about
how flying dildos works."

00:10:51.383 --> 00:10:54.587
[laughter]

00:10:54.587 --> 00:10:57.689
"Like, I feel like
I'm in the dark on this one."

00:10:57.689 --> 00:11:02.094
And she does not have, like,
happy eyes look on her face

00:11:02.094 --> 00:11:05.063
and sweeps me legs in, like,
a "Karate Kid" move.

00:11:05.063 --> 00:11:09.101
Just...
and I land hard.

00:11:09.101 --> 00:11:10.903
I land so hard, I knocked
the wind out of myself.

00:11:10.903 --> 00:11:12.837
And let me tell you something
about--when knocked out of wind,

00:11:12.837 --> 00:11:16.842
that's a real fucking noise,
just, "Hehhhhh."

00:11:16.842 --> 00:11:19.711
It is so real, and real respects
real.

00:11:19.711 --> 00:11:22.581
When you hear that, you're like,
"Oh, fuck."

00:11:22.581 --> 00:11:24.783
"Hehhhhh."

00:11:24.783 --> 00:11:29.087
She tears my pants off me, and
my dick pops out of my boxers

00:11:29.087 --> 00:11:31.790
unprepared, gentlemen.

00:11:31.790 --> 00:11:36.028
I look at my best friend, Wicho,
and I go, "Poke it back in."

00:11:36.028 --> 00:11:38.964
He's like,
"I will not be doing that."

00:11:38.964 --> 00:11:41.766
And then the air is removed out
of the room, and I hear some guy

00:11:41.766 --> 00:11:44.303
go, "Fucking do it,"
and I'm like, "What?"

00:11:44.303 --> 00:11:45.737
I look up.

00:11:45.737 --> 00:11:49.374
This woman is straddling my face
with a 12-inch black dildo

00:11:49.374 --> 00:11:52.611
and Excaliburs it into my mouth.

00:11:52.611 --> 00:11:55.547
- No!

00:11:55.547 --> 00:11:57.316
- Gentlemen, you have
a game-time decision to make.

00:11:57.316 --> 00:11:58.951
[laughter]

00:11:58.951 --> 00:12:00.218
What do you do in that
situation?

00:12:00.218 --> 00:12:01.787
Do you purse your lips,
close your teeth,

00:12:01.787 --> 00:12:04.589
and hope to block the shot?

00:12:04.589 --> 00:12:06.258
Could lose your front canines.

00:12:06.258 --> 00:12:07.893
[laughter]

00:12:07.893 --> 00:12:13.732
Or do you acquiesce and open up
and let her go yard in your jaw?

00:12:13.732 --> 00:12:15.834
[laughter]

00:12:15.834 --> 00:12:18.403
I chose the latter.

00:12:18.403 --> 00:12:21.306
She went 8 inches into my throat
just...

00:12:21.306 --> 00:12:23.275
[gagging]

00:12:23.275 --> 00:12:26.111
Now I'm gagging, the wind's
knocked out of me, and my dick's

00:12:26.111 --> 00:12:29.481
popping out, I'm wiggling like
the very last unicorn.

00:12:29.481 --> 00:12:32.317
[laughter]

00:12:32.317 --> 00:12:35.687
And she looks at the guys
and says, "Gentlemen, get your

00:12:35.687 --> 00:12:39.457
cameras and line up to get
a picture with flying dildos."

00:12:39.457 --> 00:12:43.461
These turncoats line up
like they're meeting

00:12:43.461 --> 00:12:44.997
the fucking queen.

00:12:44.997 --> 00:12:46.331
They're like, "Oh, I can't
wait," and everyone takes a

00:12:46.331 --> 00:12:47.332
picture with me...

00:12:47.332 --> 00:12:50.435
[gagging]

00:12:50.435 --> 00:12:53.872
The point of my story--
the reason I told it to you...

00:12:53.872 --> 00:12:55.874
[laughter]

00:12:55.874 --> 00:12:59.845
Is if you ever go to Amsterdam,
just go to the Anne Frank house.

00:12:59.845 --> 00:13:01.547
[laughter]

00:13:01.547 --> 00:13:02.614
Thank you.

00:13:02.614 --> 00:13:05.618
[cheers and applause]

00:13:13.025 --> 00:13:14.059 align:start position:0%
- Wait a second.

00:13:14.059 --> 00:13:15.127 align:start position:0%
First of all,
don't leave your shirt--

00:13:15.127 --> 00:13:16.528 align:start position:0%
[laughs]
Before you leave.

00:13:16.528 --> 00:13:19.231 size:84% position:42%
Second of all, did you ever
go to the Anne Frank house?

00:13:19.231 --> 00:13:20.298 align:start size:34% position:66%
- Oh, yeah.

00:13:20.298 --> 00:13:22.534 align:start size:16% position:84%
So...

00:13:22.534 --> 00:13:24.403 align:end position:100%
I was--
[clears throat]

00:13:24.403 --> 00:13:26.705
I was a little rattled after the
whole flying dildos experience,

00:13:26.705 --> 00:13:28.707 align:end position:100%
and--but all the guys
in the room

00:13:28.707 --> 00:13:30.209 align:end position:100%
thought I was
the greatest guy ever.

00:13:30.209 --> 00:13:31.577 align:end position:100%
It was like killing
in a comedy club,

00:13:31.577 --> 00:13:33.712 align:end position:100%
and I walk out,
and they're all--

00:13:33.712 --> 00:13:36.414 align:end position:100%
it's three football players
form UCF,

00:13:36.414 --> 00:13:39.051 align:end position:100%
three French Canadians,
a dude from Tennessee,

00:13:39.051 --> 00:13:41.153 align:end position:100%
and a guy from Australia,
and my four friends,

00:13:41.153 --> 00:13:42.587 align:end position:100%
and they're like,
"We would do anything with you."

00:13:42.587 --> 00:13:44.723 align:end position:100%
And I was like, "Well, I could
use some cheering up.

00:13:44.723 --> 00:13:46.358 align:end position:100%
Let's go to the
Anne Frank house."

00:13:46.358 --> 00:13:48.727
[laughter]

00:13:48.727 --> 00:13:52.097 align:start size:25% position:75%
So--so--
[laughs]

00:13:52.097 --> 00:13:53.098 align:start size:16% position:84%
So...

00:13:53.098 --> 00:13:54.200 align:start position:0%
- [laughs]

00:13:54.200 --> 00:13:55.867 align:start size:44% position:56%
- So, I, uh...

00:13:55.867 --> 00:13:58.003 align:start position:0%
- That's not a cheering up
kind of place.

00:13:58.003 --> 00:13:59.004 align:start size:75% position:25%
- It gets so much worse.

00:13:59.004 --> 00:14:01.106 align:start position:0%
- [laughing]
Yes.

00:14:01.106 --> 00:14:05.244 align:start size:50% position:50%
- So we get high
as giraffe pussy

00:14:05.244 --> 00:14:07.412 align:end position:100%
and go into the Anne Frank
house, and all I'm doing

00:14:07.412 --> 00:14:09.248 align:end position:100%
the whole time is telling
Helen Keller jokes.

00:14:09.248 --> 00:14:10.782 align:start size:31% position:69%
I'm like--

00:14:10.782 --> 00:14:12.684 align:end position:100%
I'm, like,
leaning up to them going like,

00:14:12.684 --> 00:14:14.553
"You know she had a dog, right?"

00:14:14.553 --> 00:14:17.255 align:start size:81% position:19%
And they're like, "Really?

00:14:17.255 --> 00:14:19.691 align:end position:100%
How do you know so much
about Anne Frank?"

00:14:19.691 --> 00:14:21.260 align:start size:75% position:25%
I'm like, "He ran away."

00:14:21.260 --> 00:14:22.461 align:end position:100%
And they're like,
"He ran away?"

00:14:22.461 --> 00:14:23.795 align:end position:100%
I was like, "Well, you would too
if your name was..."

00:14:23.795 --> 00:14:26.231 align:start size:72% position:28%
[babbling incoherently]

00:14:26.231 --> 00:14:27.532 align:end position:100%
We go into the kitchen
and I'm like,

00:14:27.532 --> 00:14:29.368 align:end position:100%
"Oh, here's where she burned
her fingers."

00:14:29.368 --> 00:14:31.803 align:start size:78% position:22%
And they're like, "What?"

00:14:31.803 --> 00:14:34.106 align:end position:100%
"Yeah, she tried
to read her waffle iron."

00:14:34.106 --> 00:14:35.608
[laughter]

00:14:35.608 --> 00:14:37.142 align:end position:100%
And this lady in front of us
turned--

00:14:37.142 --> 00:14:39.477 align:start position:0%
- [laughs]

00:14:39.477 --> 00:14:41.112 align:start size:53% position:47%
- This--mind you,
I'm high as fuck.

00:14:41.112 --> 00:14:42.614 align:start size:34% position:66%
This lady--

00:14:42.614 --> 00:14:46.117
- No one's gonna tell you, like,
"That's not the right person."

00:14:46.117 --> 00:14:47.419
- Lady turns around and goes,

00:14:47.419 --> 00:14:49.488 align:end position:100%
"Are you making
Helen Keller jokes?"

00:14:49.488 --> 00:14:52.424
[laughter]

00:14:52.424 --> 00:14:55.260 align:end position:100%
Ari, Ari,
I realized at that moment

00:14:55.260 --> 00:14:57.496 align:end position:100%
that we're not in
Helen Keller's house.

00:14:57.496 --> 00:14:58.630
[laughter]

00:14:58.630 --> 00:14:59.932
We're in the Anne Frank house,

00:14:59.932 --> 00:15:01.667 align:end position:100%
and I don't know
who the fuck she is.

00:15:01.667 --> 00:15:03.468
[laughter]

00:15:03.468 --> 00:15:08.306
And these guys see it in my eyes
and 12 dudes fall apart

00:15:08.306 --> 00:15:12.344
as high as fuck
in a Holocaust museum.

00:15:12.344 --> 00:15:13.912
[laughter]

00:15:13.912 --> 00:15:15.847 align:end position:100%
And that is the best laugh
you can have,

00:15:15.847 --> 00:15:17.282 align:start size:56% position:44%
is when you're not
supposed to laugh.

00:15:17.282 --> 00:15:18.283 align:start size:59% position:41%
When you're like...

00:15:18.283 --> 00:15:21.186 align:start size:56% position:44%
[guttural yelling]

00:15:22.521 --> 00:15:23.922 align:end position:100%
And I'm putting all the pieces
together like,

00:15:23.922 --> 00:15:26.358 align:end position:100%
"Oh, I think I was thinking
of Anne Sullivan."

00:15:26.358 --> 00:15:29.260 align:start position:0%
- [laughing]
No.

00:15:29.260 --> 00:15:30.328 align:start size:22% position:78%
- Shit.

00:15:30.328 --> 00:15:31.663 align:end position:100%
Oh, yeah, yeah,
this is the wrong--

00:15:31.663 --> 00:15:32.831 align:end position:100%
I go,
"What happened to this girl?"

00:15:32.831 --> 00:15:33.966 align:start size:59% position:41%
And they're like...

00:15:33.966 --> 00:15:35.600
[laughter]

00:15:35.600 --> 00:15:36.635
- She didn't invent Braille.

00:15:36.635 --> 00:15:37.636 align:start size:31% position:69%
- [laughs]

00:15:37.636 --> 00:15:39.304
Didn't invent Braille!

00:15:39.304 --> 00:15:41.506 align:start position:0%
- [laughs]

00:15:41.506 --> 00:15:42.507
- [sighs]

00:15:42.507 --> 00:15:43.508
That's it.

00:15:43.508 --> 00:15:44.509 align:start position:0%
- Yeah.

00:15:44.509 --> 00:15:46.478
[laughter]

00:15:46.478 --> 00:15:47.779 align:start size:38% position:63%
- Thank you.
