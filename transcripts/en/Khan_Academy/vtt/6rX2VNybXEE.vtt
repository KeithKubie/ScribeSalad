00:00:00.344 --> 00:00:02.629
- [Instructor] Alright,
we are asked to choose

00:00:02.629 --> 00:00:04.707
the graph of the function.

00:00:04.707 --> 00:00:06.423
And the function is f(x) is equal to

00:00:06.423 --> 00:00:08.305
two, times three to the x

00:00:08.305 --> 00:00:10.099
and we have three choices here.

00:00:10.099 --> 00:00:12.220
So, pause this video and
see if you can determine

00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:14.176
which of these three graphs

00:00:14.176 --> 00:00:17.893
actually is the graph of f(x).

00:00:17.893 --> 00:00:19.975
Let's work through this together.

00:00:19.975 --> 00:00:21.970
So, whenever I have a function like this,

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:23.886
which is an exponential function,

00:00:23.886 --> 00:00:25.478
because I'm taking some number

00:00:25.478 --> 00:00:30.172
and I'm multiplying it by some
other number to some power.

00:00:30.172 --> 00:00:32.702
So, that tells me that I'm
dealing with an exponential.

00:00:32.702 --> 00:00:34.783
So, I like to think about two things.

00:00:34.783 --> 00:00:37.890
What happens when x equals zero?

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:41.069
What is the value of our function?

00:00:41.069 --> 00:00:42.865
Well, when you just look at this function,

00:00:42.865 --> 00:00:46.454
this would be two,
times three to the zero.

00:00:46.454 --> 00:00:48.984
Which is equal to, three
to the zero is one.

00:00:48.984 --> 00:00:50.780
It's equal to two.

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:52.206
So, one way to think about it.

00:00:52.206 --> 00:00:55.664
In the graph of y is equal to f(x),

00:00:55.664 --> 00:00:59.908
when x is equal to
zero, y is equal to two.

00:00:59.908 --> 00:01:01.456
Or another way to think about it is

00:01:01.456 --> 00:01:03.490
this value in exponential function,

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:04.959
sometimes called the initial value,

00:01:04.959 --> 00:01:06.753
if you were thinking of the x-axis.

00:01:06.753 --> 00:01:09.243
Instead of the x-axis, you're
thinking about the time axis

00:01:09.243 --> 00:01:10.547
or the t-axis.

00:01:10.547 --> 00:01:12.630
That's why it's sometimes
called the initial value.

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:15.154
But the y-intercept is
gonna be described by that

00:01:15.154 --> 00:01:17.387
when you have a function of this form.

00:01:17.387 --> 00:01:19.501
And you saw it right over there, f(0).

00:01:19.501 --> 00:01:20.606
Three to the zero's one.

00:01:20.606 --> 00:01:22.116
You're just left with the two.

00:01:22.116 --> 00:01:25.180
So, which of these have
a y-intercept of two?

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:27.505
Well, here, the
y-intercept looks like one.

00:01:27.505 --> 00:01:29.710
Here, the y-intercept looks like three.

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:32.000
Here, the y-intercept is two.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.418
So, just through elimination
through that alone,

00:01:34.418 --> 00:01:36.128
we can feel pretty good that

00:01:36.128 --> 00:01:38.941
this third graph is probably the choice.

00:01:38.941 --> 00:01:40.570
But let's keep on analyzing it

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:41.670
to feel even better about it.

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:43.711
And so, we have the skills for really any

00:01:43.711 --> 00:01:46.974
exponential function
that we might run into.

00:01:46.974 --> 00:01:48.808
Well, the other thing to realize.

00:01:48.808 --> 00:01:51.660
This number, three, is often referred to

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:53.160
as a common ratio.

00:01:54.145 --> 00:01:57.856
And that's because every
time you increase x by one,

00:01:57.856 --> 00:02:00.469
you're gonna be taking
three to a one higher power.

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:03.446
Or you're essentially gonna
be multiplying by three again.

00:02:03.446 --> 00:02:07.229
So, for example, f(1) is going to be

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:09.917
equal to two, times three to the one.

00:02:09.917 --> 00:02:12.733
Two, times three to the
one or two times three,

00:02:12.733 --> 00:02:14.039
which is equal to six.

00:02:14.039 --> 00:02:16.851
So, from f(0) to f(1), you essentially

00:02:16.851 --> 00:02:18.687
have to multiply by three.

00:02:18.687 --> 00:02:20.443
And you keep multiplying by three.

00:02:20.443 --> 00:02:23.866
f(2) you're gonna multiply by three again.

00:02:23.866 --> 00:02:27.004
It's gonna be two, times three squared,

00:02:27.004 --> 00:02:28.471
which is equal to 18.

00:02:28.471 --> 00:02:32.467
And so, once again, when
I increased my x by one,

00:02:32.467 --> 00:02:36.511
I'm multiplying the value
of my function by three.

00:02:36.511 --> 00:02:38.056
So, let's just see which of these do this.

00:02:38.056 --> 00:02:40.548
This one we said has
the wrong y-intercept,

00:02:40.548 --> 00:02:44.590
but, as we go from x equals
zero to x equals one,

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:46.624
we are going from one to three.

00:02:46.624 --> 00:02:50.371
And then, we are going from three till

00:02:50.371 --> 00:02:52.163
looks like pretty close to nine.

00:02:52.163 --> 00:02:53.713
So, it does look like this does

00:02:53.713 --> 00:02:55.060
have a common ratio of three.

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:57.959
It just does have a different y-intercept

00:02:57.959 --> 00:02:59.225
than the function we care about.

00:02:59.225 --> 00:03:00.327
This looks like the graph

00:03:00.327 --> 00:03:03.833
f(x) is equal to just
one, times 3 to the x.

00:03:03.833 --> 00:03:06.315
Here, we're starting at three.

00:03:06.315 --> 00:03:08.395
And then, when x equals one,

00:03:08.395 --> 00:03:12.562
it looks like we are doubling
every time x increases by one.

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:18.139
So, this looks like the
graph of y is equal to...

00:03:18.139 --> 00:03:20.461
I have what we could
call our initial value,

00:03:20.461 --> 00:03:22.868
our y-intercept, three.

00:03:22.868 --> 00:03:25.435
And, if we're doubling every
time, we increase by one.

00:03:25.435 --> 00:03:27.516
Three, times two to the x.

00:03:27.516 --> 00:03:28.820
That's this graph here.

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:30.207
As I said, this first graph looks like

00:03:30.207 --> 00:03:33.540
y is equal to one, times three to the x.

00:03:35.105 --> 00:03:36.450
We are tripling every time.

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:37.837
One, times three to the x.

00:03:37.837 --> 00:03:41.309
Or we could just say y is
equal to three to the x.

00:03:41.309 --> 00:03:42.531
Now, this one here better work,

00:03:42.531 --> 00:03:44.854
'cause we already picked
it as our solution.

00:03:44.854 --> 00:03:47.015
So, let's see if that's actually the case.

00:03:47.015 --> 00:03:50.890
So, as we increase by one,
we should multiply by three.

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:54.693
So, two times three is, indeed, six.

00:03:54.693 --> 00:03:56.407
And then, when you
increase by another one,

00:03:56.407 --> 00:03:57.875
we should go to 18.

00:03:57.875 --> 00:03:59.591
And that's kind of off the charts here,

00:03:59.591 --> 00:04:01.017
but it does seem reasonable to see that

00:04:01.017 --> 00:04:04.487
we are multiplying by three every time.

00:04:04.487 --> 00:04:06.889
And you could also go the other way.

00:04:06.889 --> 00:04:09.538
If you're going down by one,

00:04:09.538 --> 00:04:11.334
you should be dividing by three.

00:04:11.334 --> 00:04:12.718
So, two divided by three,

00:04:12.718 --> 00:04:16.512
this does look pretty close to 2/3.

00:04:16.512 --> 00:04:20.679
So, we should feel very
good about our third choice.
