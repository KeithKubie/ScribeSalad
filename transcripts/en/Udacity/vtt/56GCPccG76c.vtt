00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
These diagrams are kind of giving me a hint as to how we might incorporate energy lost to heat

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
into our calculations involving conservation of energy.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
So actually what I want to know is which of these equations best relates

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
the final energy, the initial energy, and the energy lost.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000
So for example by final energy, I mean final useful energy--may be kinetic energy.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.000
Initial energy would be this initial potential energy, and energy lost--

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000
because remember energy is never really destroyed--would be this energy lost to heat.

00:00:27.000 --> 99:59:59.000
Which of these equations describe the final energy?
