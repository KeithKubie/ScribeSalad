Now, the network section of the cash manifest contains files

00:00:04.210 --> 00:00:07.840
that explicitly needs a network connection. Foe example, we can't

00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:12.110
really cash the google-analytics page because the connection is important.

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:14.520
If you have a image resource that's a live webcam

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:16.940
image or some other kind of data that has to

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:19.440
be loaded over the network, putting that resource in this

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:22.440
section will bypass the out cash. And try loading the

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:26.410
resource from the network, even while it's offline. And finally,

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:28.920
the Fallback section is where you set up alt

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:31.740
cache alternatives for resources that need to come from the

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:35.569
network. For example that live webcam image. Maybe you want to

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:38.540
cache an old version of it. The browser will use

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:41.210
the rules in this section to load an alternative.

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:43.570
But only after trying to load the resource from the

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:46.870
network first. For that reason you should use the Fallback

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:50.180
section sparingly because it will await for a network timeout.
