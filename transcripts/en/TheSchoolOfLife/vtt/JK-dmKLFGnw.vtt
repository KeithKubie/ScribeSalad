00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:11.200
There are so many reasons to be frantic, to
run from one thing to another

00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:18.500
to be pumped high with anxiety and dread.

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:26.270
And yet - as we know in our hearts - it is
even more of a priority to keep an occasional

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:29.500
appointment with someone we neglect in our
normal frenzy.

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:35.270
A deeper, quieter part of ourselves.

00:00:41.659 --> 00:00:45.000
We have intimations of it at night, on the
motorway.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
Or in the grey stillness of the early morning.

00:00:52.749 --> 00:00:55.159
It seems everything we do matters so much

00:00:55.159 --> 00:01:00.800
but, to stay sane, we need to hear a different,
more humbling message:

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:06.240
That everything we do and are is in truth
meaningless - when considered from a sufficient distance.

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:12.410
 

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:14.479
From the perspective of
the timeless stones

00:01:14.479 --> 00:01:21.479
the relentless, pounding seas - 
the infinite heavens

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:34.090
From here, you can see Venus and Jupiter in
the darkening sky. When dusk deepens you can

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:40.360
see distant stars – Aldebaran, Andromeda,
Aries and the suggestion of a billion others

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:43.210
beyond the weakness of your field of vision.

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:49.480
To counter our tendencies to exaggerate and
panic, we need to meditate on our utter insignificance

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:56.480
when measured against aeons of time and space.

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:03.920
Even on our own planet, there is so much that
is strange, wondrous, 'other' 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:08.119
and completely indifferent to us.

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:11.780
This is the village of Roka Kandal, near Kratie
in Cambodia.

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:14.530
Roughly 500 families live here.

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:17.930
About 800 kids go to the local school.

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:23.120
The boys play May Khamin – they put a bottle
in a box in the sand, and shoot elastic bands at it

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:26.100
If you hit the bottle, you’re the
boss.

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:34.290
Most of the villagers are farmers. To relax,
they play boules, or go to the local cinema.

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:39.700
They don’t know anything about you; your
sorrows, the gossip about you, the dilemmas

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:41.250
of your career...

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:48.250
and you, till now, knew nothing about
them.

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:58.400
We exist too much in the minds of others.
We are perpetual over-dramatizers of who we are and what we do.

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:05.200
We should learn to develop a readier awareness

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:09.400
of our beautifully miniscule place in the
wider scheme of things

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:14.700
to free ourselves from our constant debilitating anxieties

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:20.900
to bring a little perspective back to our
needlessly tense and preciously brief lives.
