00:00:02.967 --> 00:00:04.500
What is this community like?

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:08.166
70% Are Latino and
African-American.

00:00:08.166 --> 00:00:09.700
It's a working class community.

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:12.266
How hard is it to
get people in a town

00:00:12.266 --> 00:00:16.166
like this motivated to
take on something this big?

00:00:16.166 --> 00:00:19.367
There are amazing people
that I have met here

00:00:19.367 --> 00:00:21.934
that maybe have not
ever been a part

00:00:21.934 --> 00:00:23.600
of a campaign in their lives.

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:27.367
Have never spoken publicly,
have never knocked on doors,

00:00:27.367 --> 00:00:28.600
and they're doing it.

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:30.066
It's almost like
everyday people have

00:00:30.066 --> 00:00:32.667
to learn how to be activists.

00:00:32.667 --> 00:00:33.667
Absolutely.

00:00:33.667 --> 00:00:35.367
AMERICA FERRERA:
(VOICEOVER) Christine

00:00:35.367 --> 00:00:37.200
says that while a big part
of the Beyond Coal strategy

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.500
is to encourage locals
to lead the charge,

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:42.734
talking only about climate
change isn't enough.

00:00:42.734 --> 00:00:45.033
In this community,
the potential health

00:00:45.033 --> 00:00:47.433
impacts are more of a concern.

00:00:47.433 --> 00:00:50.600
And Christine says I'll
understand why if I meet Dulce

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:53.066
Ortiz, who lives and
works downtown just

00:00:53.066 --> 00:00:54.967
a stone's throw
from the coal plant.

00:00:54.967 --> 00:00:55.867
Wow.

00:00:55.867 --> 00:00:57.100
Oh wow.

00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:58.567
That's right outside
your window, huh?

00:00:58.567 --> 00:01:00.233
Yes, it is.

00:01:00.233 --> 00:01:02.266
What's that like?

00:01:02.266 --> 00:01:04.800
It's frustrating
and inspiring,

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:07.367
but mostly frustrating.

00:01:07.367 --> 00:01:08.934
AMERICA FERRERA:
(VOICEOVER) Dulce

00:01:08.934 --> 00:01:11.433
tells me she's worried about
the health impact the pollution

00:01:11.433 --> 00:01:15.333
from the plant might have on
her 14-year-old son, Ivan,

00:01:15.333 --> 00:01:17.834
and her mother Sonya
who also lives in town.

00:01:17.834 --> 00:01:21.133
So what are some of the
personal impacts that the coal

00:01:21.133 --> 00:01:24.133
plant has had on you guys?

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:36.100
You've developed
similar issues.

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:37.667
Yes.

00:01:37.667 --> 00:01:41.100
Is this something that is more
widespread in the community,

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:44.066
or is this just your family?

00:01:44.066 --> 00:01:46.600
No, it's in the community.

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:47.533
It's bad.

00:01:47.533 --> 00:01:50.400
Of course we can't
say that asthma

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:52.600
is caused by the coal plant.

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:57.033
But the pollution that's
being put out into the air

00:01:57.033 --> 00:01:58.900
creates the asthma attacks.

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:00.367
AMERICA FERRERA:
(VOICEOVER) Dulce

00:02:00.367 --> 00:02:03.400
explains that such attacks
are common in Waukegan.

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:06.166
One study found that one
in three schoolchildren

00:02:06.166 --> 00:02:09.066
had asthma or asthma-like
symptoms-- a rate

00:02:09.066 --> 00:02:11.533
far higher than in
the rest of the state.

00:02:11.533 --> 00:02:13.467
But before meeting
Christine, Dulce

00:02:13.467 --> 00:02:16.734
didn't even realize what the
plant outside her window was.

00:02:16.734 --> 00:02:18.233
You didn't know
there was a coal plant?

00:02:18.233 --> 00:02:19.967
No, I don't know!

00:02:19.967 --> 00:02:22.333
I told Christine, what can I do?

00:02:22.333 --> 00:02:23.567
What do you want me to do?

00:02:23.567 --> 00:02:24.567
Whatever you want me
to do, I'll do it.
