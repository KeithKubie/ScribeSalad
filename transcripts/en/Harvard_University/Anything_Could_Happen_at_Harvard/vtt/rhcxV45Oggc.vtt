[ Nicholas Narrating ]
I’m a journalist and Harvard class of 1982.

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:09.500
I’ve lived all over:

00:00:10.233 --> 00:00:12.100
Egypt and Oxford.

00:00:12.667 --> 00:00:14.500
China and Congo.

00:00:14.567 --> 00:00:18.633
And in my travels, I’ve discovered
that Harvard isn’t just a place...

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:20.700
it’s a community.

00:00:21.267 --> 00:00:24.233
I found support through Harvard bonds.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.133
There are more than 350,000 alumni
scattered all over the world.

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:32.000
We’re waiting for you to join us.

00:00:32.767 --> 00:00:34.733
My name is Nicholas Kristof.

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:39.367
When you consider Harvard,
make sure to consider...

00:00:40.567 --> 00:00:42.133
what comes after.
