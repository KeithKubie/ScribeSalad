Hey reactors, Trace here for a DNews short.

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:10.960
If you're a regular watcher of DNews you know
nuclear reactors come in two flavors -- fission

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:12.260
and fusion.

00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:15.130
Fission is about breaking atoms apart to release
energy.

00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:17.970
Fusion is about squishing atoms together to
release energy.

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:22.520
"Nuclear power" is fission, but we really
wanna figure out this fusion thing.

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:23.520
It's better.

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:30.540
In December 2015, a new fusion reactor was
tested and it's more efficient than any before

00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:32.680
it -- the Wendelstein 7-X stellarator.

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:35.950
It even sounds cool… oh, and it looks like
a donut.

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:40.940
A variety of fusion reactors have been proposed,
with mixed levels of success.

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:43.970
Tokamaks and Stellarators seem to be the best
way forward.

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:47.930
Though they’re very different designs, at
their core, they both create magnetic fields

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:50.770
to contain donuts of this superheated plasma.

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:55.660
The stellarator is less popular because they're
tougher to build; it took 19 years to construct

00:00:55.660 --> 00:01:01.710
the W-7X but once it turned on, it briefly
contained plasma at "80 million degrees centigrade

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:02.710
for a quarter of a second."

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:08.240
Unfortunately, 80 million degrees isn't quite
enough to mimic what we think happens inside

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:09.240
the sun.

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:13.460
The sun is fueled by the fusion of superheated
plasmas of hydrogen that are smushed together

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:16.190
(or fused) inside the sun's core, forming
helium.

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:20.710
If scientists can get the temperature over
100 million degrees celsius, the electrons

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:24.850
of hydrogen would be stripped away, and the
nuclei would smash into each other and fuse…

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:26.230
creating energy.

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:30.260
Hydrogen is the most abundant material in
the universe -- if we can figure out fusion,

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:33.060
we'll have an “almost inexhaustible" source
of energy.

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:34.860
So, this isn't ready yet.

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:39.250
It took more energy to make the flash of plasma
in the stellarator than they got out of it.

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:42.880
But, if they can hit their specifications
and keep it running for 30 minutes… that

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:44.480
could change everything.

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:45.480
The current record?

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:48.409
A French tokamak was on for 6-and-a-half minutes.

00:01:48.409 --> 00:01:49.840
We're not there yet, but we're on our way.

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:54.240

other fusion reactors, check out this video.

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:55.759
Do you have questions?

00:01:55.759 --> 00:01:56.759
Comments?

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:57.759
Complaints?

00:01:57.759 --> 00:01:58.759
Whatever?

00:01:58.759 --> 00:01:59.759
How's things?
