DAVID: So welcome to Google,
Google in Cambridge here.

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:14.380
Today it's my
pleasure to introduce

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:19.690
Paul Horowitz, professor at
Harvard down the road from us.

00:00:19.690 --> 00:00:23.780
I knew Paul Horowitz when
I was in college back then.

00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:26.800
Many of you know him as
the author or the co-author

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:30.790
of a book called "Horowitz and
Hill-- the Art of Electronics,"

00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:34.260
which is a fantastic textbook
in reference for people who

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.270
are both electronics
hacker professionals

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:39.330
and electronic hacker amateurs.

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:42.210
Paul has a third edition
of the book just out,

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:46.110
and I contacted him, and
I said, come talk to us,

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:47.440
and come give us a book talk.

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:50.410
You can come read from the
chapter on field effect

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:56.040
transistors, entertain us, and
I thought that would be great.

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:59.890
But he said, you know,
he's got his day job.

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:03.830
His day job is looking
for extraterrestrials,

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:08.030
and that turns out to
be interesting as well.

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:10.740
So I said, sure, come
talk to us about that.

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:11.760
So he'll do that.

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.330
I think he'll be taking
some questions at the end.

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:16.820
We can talk about the book
a little bit then as well,

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:18.570
but I imagine this
will all be great fun.

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:21.044
So without further
ado, Paul Horowitz.

00:01:21.044 --> 00:01:24.432
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:29.150
PAUL HOROWITZ: So I'm
going to talk generally

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:31.854
about the subject of
SETI, and specifically

00:01:31.854 --> 00:01:34.020
about some of the stuff
we've been doing at Harvard,

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:36.400
and I'll tell you also about
some of the new stuff going on.

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:37.900
You may have heard
that $100 million

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:41.140
got given in a thing called
the Breakthrough Listen

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:44.980
Initiative by the Breakthrough
Foundation, Yuri Milner,

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:47.270
and that thing is
just starting up now.

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:51.720
OK, so it's really nice to
see David after 25 years.

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:54.750
I should just tell
you about David.

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:57.630
When he took our
electronics course, he did,

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:59.480
as he's described
here, he's a zealot

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:02.695
to show what he could do
with our little computer

00:02:02.695 --> 00:02:03.320
that you build.

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:06.760
This is a circuit of it,
in case you'd like to see.

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:09.680
From the bare metal, we had
the students build this thing

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:11.760
really wire by wire.

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:13.310
And it's really bare metal.

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:15.190
You may notice some
things that are missing.

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:17.250
For instance,
there's no keyboard.

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:18.360
There's no monitor.

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:19.590
There's no disk.

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:21.000
There's no operating system.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.560
There's not even a
serial port, and David

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:27.210
managed to outfit this
thing with a set of DACs

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:30.500
and extra memory, and he did bit
banging to make a serial port,

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:32.730
and he programmed this
thing to play Asteroids.

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:34.620
So we thought that was
pretty spectacular,

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:37.780
and he earned this little
notice in our student manual.

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:39.260
So that was pretty cool.

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:43.420
I'm not surprised to see
him at the Googleplex.

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:45.680
He's that kind of guy.

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:47.750
I remember he needed a
quad DAC for this thing,

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:50.890
and he got on his bike and
bicycled out to Analog Devices

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:52.370
to get the part to
make this thing.

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:55.340
So pretty cool.

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:58.360
I'm going to try here to put
an awful lot of stuff in here,

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:00.800
and since I'm not really
quite sure what backgrounds

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:03.620
are out here today, I'm going to
try not to be boring and throw

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:05.630
a little bit in for everything.

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:10.555
I'm going to start with
a slide after this one.

00:03:10.555 --> 00:03:12.430
There was a series of
talks at the MIT Museum

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:15.700
a few years back called
Life in the Universe,

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:20.590
and the last talk was on finding
them, and the one before that,

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:24.567
I went to just to see what kind
of people go to these things.

00:03:24.567 --> 00:03:26.400
And one of the questions
during that session

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:30.580
was something like
this-- I've heard

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:33.590
that spy satellites can read
license plates down on Earth

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:34.310
here.

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:37.620
Can't we just do that on
planets around other stars?

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:41.084
And the guy who was
talking said, well,

00:03:41.084 --> 00:03:42.750
I think that's a
question for next time.

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:44.020
Well, next time
was my time, so I

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:45.311
decided I'd start with a slide.

00:03:45.311 --> 00:03:47.340
So here's the slide,
which is well,

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:49.512
what about the
license plate myth,

00:03:49.512 --> 00:03:50.720
and what about other planets?

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:53.230
So here's the deal.

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:56.060
You can just do a basic
optical calculation, which

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:59.610
is look at diffraction limited
resolution looking down,

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:02.570
but turn the Hubble in the wrong
direction, programming error.

00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:04.580
You're probably running
Windows or something,

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:07.610
and if you take the actual
parameters of the Hubble,

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:09.940
fly it a little low,
about 100 miles,

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:12.430
and just look at what the
diffraction limited resolution

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:12.930
is.

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:14.580
It's about 1.6
inches, so you could

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:16.379
reach large license plates.

00:04:16.379 --> 00:04:18.670
Of course, license plates
are on the back side of cars,

00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:20.670
so if you're looking straight
down, you wouldn't see it.

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:22.150
You'd have to put the
license plate on the top,

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:23.733
but anyway, the
number is about right.

00:04:23.733 --> 00:04:27.800
But then what about doing
this on other planets?

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:31.100
Well, let's go for some
serious distance here.

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:33.684
Let's try a planet around a
star about 25 light years away.

00:04:33.684 --> 00:04:35.850
That's far enough out to
have some reasonable number

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:39.090
of candidates for
habitable planets.

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:42.540
And the good news
is that there's

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:43.832
no problem with the brightness.

00:04:43.832 --> 00:04:45.331
You might think,
well, far away, you

00:04:45.331 --> 00:04:46.570
don't have very many photons.

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:50.349
But that's not the
problem, because you

00:04:50.349 --> 00:04:51.890
have to use a bigger
telescope to get

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:53.450
the same diffraction
limited resolution,

00:04:53.450 --> 00:04:55.408
and that's going to scale
up like the distance.

00:04:55.408 --> 00:04:59.560
So when you scale up the
telescope proportional

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:04.860
to the distance, then to
keep the same resolution

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:06.440
in the collecting area goes up.

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:08.410
It can square the
distance, and that exactly

00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:09.980
compensates for the
falloff of light, which

00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:11.110
is the square of distance.

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:12.443
So you've got plenty of photons.

00:05:12.443 --> 00:05:13.010
No prob.

00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:15.160
The prob is you need
kind of a big telescope,

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:17.000
and here's how big it is.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:21.000
It works out to be about 18 AU.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:24.230
18 AU is the mean distance
of Earth from sun.

00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:27.450
And so I made a little
scale model here.

00:05:27.450 --> 00:05:31.610
There's an antenna that's about
the size of Saturn's orbit.

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:34.920
Kind of big, and I people
don't make optical telescopes

00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:37.650
that big, so I just stole a
radio telescope picture here.

00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:40.110
But the other thing is it
has to be kind of accurate,

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:42.860
because this is light, and it
has to be diffraction limited,

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:46.032
so it has to be accurate
to better than 1/20

00:05:46.032 --> 00:05:48.240
of a wavelength of light
works out to be about 1/1000

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:49.550
the diameter of a human hair.

00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:53.370
This is an interesting antenna.

00:05:53.370 --> 00:05:56.150
But then you think, OK, if
they have license plates,

00:05:56.150 --> 00:05:57.940
then they have cars,
and they have laws,

00:05:57.940 --> 00:05:59.650
and that means they have police.

00:05:59.650 --> 00:06:02.120
And that means they
have police radios,

00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:03.540
so they know about radios.

00:06:03.540 --> 00:06:05.290
So they know what
radio communication.

00:06:05.290 --> 00:06:07.822
Why don't we just ask
them what the license

00:06:07.822 --> 00:06:10.280
plates look like instead of
doing this kind of crazy thing?

00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:12.720
So that gets into the whole
business of communication

00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:13.970
over these distances.

00:06:13.970 --> 00:06:15.250
So here's a nerdy slide.

00:06:15.250 --> 00:06:18.616
Some of these slides are
sort of warning away nerds,

00:06:18.616 --> 00:06:20.740
but you guys are nerds, so
there's no problem here.

00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:22.420
So here's the question.

00:06:22.420 --> 00:06:24.460
Can you communicate
over these distances?

00:06:24.460 --> 00:06:26.170
And you might start
with-- by the way,

00:06:26.170 --> 00:06:27.590
I'm not a PowerPoint guy.

00:06:27.590 --> 00:06:29.760
Maybe you can tell.

00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:31.494
But I did learn
about the animation,

00:06:31.494 --> 00:06:33.910
but all I could figure was you
could fly in from the left.

00:06:33.910 --> 00:06:36.600
So a lot of stuff
flies in from the left.

00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:38.420
Sorry about that.

00:06:38.420 --> 00:06:40.900
So take a couple of modest
sized digits, 300 meters.

00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:45.384
That's the size of the Arecibo
great dish down in Puerto Rico.

00:06:45.384 --> 00:06:46.800
Put these things
a modest distance

00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:48.222
apart like 1,000 light years.

00:06:48.222 --> 00:06:49.680
Within 1,000 light
years, there are

00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:52.560
about a million sun-like stars,
so this is a reasonable piece

00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:53.540
of the galaxy.

00:06:53.540 --> 00:06:56.240
It's about the thickness of
the galaxy out where we live.

00:06:56.240 --> 00:07:01.590
And transmit $1 worth of
electrical energy converted

00:07:01.590 --> 00:07:02.990
into radio waves.

00:07:02.990 --> 00:07:04.590
So here's the thing
called a nerd box,

00:07:04.590 --> 00:07:07.106
and the nerd box
simply calculates

00:07:07.106 --> 00:07:08.730
how much energy will
be received if you

00:07:08.730 --> 00:07:11.510
transmit $1 worth with the
fraction limited antennas

00:07:11.510 --> 00:07:12.690
of this size.

00:07:12.690 --> 00:07:15.130
And it works out to be about
2 times n minus 11 ergs when

00:07:15.130 --> 00:07:16.380
you scratch through the thing.

00:07:16.380 --> 00:07:18.060
By the way, the antenna has
quite a lot of gain there.

00:07:18.060 --> 00:07:20.490
I just marked in there
it's about 90 db of gain,

00:07:20.490 --> 00:07:21.910
factor of 10 to the ninth.

00:07:21.910 --> 00:07:23.260
So that helps a lot.

00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:26.340
Big antennas, short
wavelength-- that's good.

00:07:26.340 --> 00:07:27.990
But what's 10 the minus 11 ergs?

00:07:27.990 --> 00:07:29.090
What does it compete with?

00:07:29.090 --> 00:07:31.220
Well, it competes with
background-- oh, yeah, you've

00:07:31.220 --> 00:07:32.928
got to have the little
thing here, again,

00:07:32.928 --> 00:07:35.064
for the regular
audience, which is

00:07:35.064 --> 00:07:37.230
when you get to the punchline,
that's the good part.

00:07:37.230 --> 00:07:39.260
This is one of those
Sid Harris cartoons

00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:42.310
used without permission here.

00:07:42.310 --> 00:07:45.040
This works out to be
about a trillionth

00:07:45.040 --> 00:07:46.740
the energy of a
falling snowflake,

00:07:46.740 --> 00:07:48.670
so it's not a lot
of energy there.

00:07:48.670 --> 00:07:51.470
But it competes with even
smaller background numbers,

00:07:51.470 --> 00:07:53.130
which is thermal noise.

00:07:53.130 --> 00:07:54.642
And at these kinds
of wavelengths,

00:07:54.642 --> 00:07:56.100
you can achieve
system temperatures

00:07:56.100 --> 00:07:58.650
of 25 Kelvins or even
less, or about 10

00:07:58.650 --> 00:08:01.350
to the minus 15 ergs, a few
times 10 to the minus 15.

00:08:01.350 --> 00:08:02.990
So in other words,
the receive signals

00:08:02.990 --> 00:08:04.940
about 10,000 times noise.

00:08:04.940 --> 00:08:05.590
No problem.

00:08:05.590 --> 00:08:07.506
In fact, you could chop
it up into little bits

00:08:07.506 --> 00:08:09.570
and send a whole bunch of bytes.

00:08:09.570 --> 00:08:12.950
So interstellar
telegrams are cheap.

00:08:12.950 --> 00:08:15.400
Here's, again, the same
diagram, and they cost something

00:08:15.400 --> 00:08:17.360
like half a cent per word.

00:08:17.360 --> 00:08:19.920
This is a calculation
originally that I

00:08:19.920 --> 00:08:21.770
saw from a wonderful
professor at Harvard

00:08:21.770 --> 00:08:23.060
by the name of Ed Purcell.

00:08:23.060 --> 00:08:25.850
Perhaps, some of you
know his E&amp;M book.

00:08:25.850 --> 00:08:28.330
Anyway, that sounds good.

00:08:28.330 --> 00:08:29.280
What's coming next?

00:08:29.280 --> 00:08:31.154
I guess what's
coming next is OK,

00:08:31.154 --> 00:08:33.070
but what's out there
within 1,000 light years?

00:08:33.070 --> 00:08:34.840
And here's a little
picture of the galaxy.

00:08:34.840 --> 00:08:36.715
It's kind of a flat
thing with lots of stars.

00:08:36.715 --> 00:08:37.270
Some are red.

00:08:37.270 --> 00:08:38.190
Some are blue.

00:08:38.190 --> 00:08:40.590
There we are out in the--
does this pointer work?

00:08:40.590 --> 00:08:41.940
Oh, this pointer works.

00:08:41.940 --> 00:08:43.980
Can you see that?

00:08:43.980 --> 00:08:46.330
Here we are, sort of in
the galactic suburbs.

00:08:46.330 --> 00:08:49.120
And in the immediate
region where we are,

00:08:49.120 --> 00:08:50.700
the galaxy is about
1,000 light years

00:08:50.700 --> 00:08:53.490
in thickness from where most
of the stars are in the disk,

00:08:53.490 --> 00:08:56.340
and there's about a million like
the sun number I made before.

00:08:56.340 --> 00:08:59.590
So there's plenty of
candidates, and as we

00:08:59.590 --> 00:09:04.420
know from recent exoplanet
searches, experiments,

00:09:04.420 --> 00:09:08.820
things like Kepler, and so
on, most stars have planets,

00:09:08.820 --> 00:09:11.190
and probably 20% of them
have Earth-like planets--

00:09:11.190 --> 00:09:12.780
inhabitable.

00:09:12.780 --> 00:09:15.100
Maybe 10% or 20% habitable
Earth-like planets.

00:09:15.100 --> 00:09:17.320
It's an amazing number.

00:09:17.320 --> 00:09:18.940
20 years ago, nobody knew that.

00:09:18.940 --> 00:09:21.570
In fact, nobody had any examples
of planetary systems anywhere

00:09:21.570 --> 00:09:25.330
except here and one
weirdo with pulsars.

00:09:25.330 --> 00:09:26.140
What's this say?

00:09:26.140 --> 00:09:29.340
Oh, yeah, and if you're worried
that that's not the stars--

00:09:29.340 --> 00:09:31.340
I don't know why
you'd worry-- there's

00:09:31.340 --> 00:09:33.720
10 to the 11th galaxies.

00:09:33.720 --> 00:09:36.380
The only problem is there's
that pesky speed of light thing,

00:09:36.380 --> 00:09:38.250
so they may be out
there, but it's

00:09:38.250 --> 00:09:43.271
kind of annoyingly long
round-trip latency.

00:09:43.271 --> 00:09:45.020
If you want one of
these gee whiz numbers,

00:09:45.020 --> 00:09:45.910
here's the gee whiz number.

00:09:45.910 --> 00:09:47.910
There are more stars in
the universe than grains

00:09:47.910 --> 00:09:50.220
of sand on all beaches of
Earth, and I can say this

00:09:50.220 --> 00:09:52.300
with some authority having
done the back of the envelope

00:09:52.300 --> 00:09:54.383
calculation, which was
just flew in from the left.

00:09:57.020 --> 00:09:59.370
And what I did was I was
generous with my beaches.

00:09:59.370 --> 00:10:02.460
I let there be 100,000
kilometers of beaches.

00:10:05.360 --> 00:10:08.070
Shorelines are fractal kind
of, and they zigzag in and out.

00:10:08.070 --> 00:10:10.580
I gave these things
100 meters of depth.

00:10:10.580 --> 00:10:13.710
That's a pretty good beach,
and toward the water--

00:10:13.710 --> 00:10:14.590
30 feet deep.

00:10:14.590 --> 00:10:15.560
Not bad, huh?

00:10:15.560 --> 00:10:18.340
So there's 10 to the 11th
cubic meters of beach,

00:10:18.340 --> 00:10:22.360
and I gave sand a half
a millimeter cubed.

00:10:22.360 --> 00:10:24.630
That's about 10 minus
10 cubic meters,

00:10:24.630 --> 00:10:26.270
so you get 10 to the
21 grains of sand,

00:10:26.270 --> 00:10:29.370
but there's 10 to the 22 stars
at least in the universe.

00:10:29.370 --> 00:10:32.260
So there you go.

00:10:32.260 --> 00:10:35.690
This is done on the back of
a crane's beautiful envelope,

00:10:35.690 --> 00:10:38.070
and I showed this
thing at a conference

00:10:38.070 --> 00:10:39.770
called EG in California.

00:10:39.770 --> 00:10:42.230
A whole bunch of very
interesting people go to that,

00:10:42.230 --> 00:10:44.917
and one of them is
the MythBuster guy,

00:10:44.917 --> 00:10:46.000
the guy with the red hair.

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:47.660
What's his name?

00:10:47.660 --> 00:10:48.302
Adam Savage.

00:10:48.302 --> 00:10:50.260
And he said afterward,
he looked at this thing.

00:10:50.260 --> 00:10:52.510
He said, I've got to
have that envelope.

00:10:52.510 --> 00:10:54.230
He said, send it to me.

00:10:54.230 --> 00:10:55.950
I'll send you
something really cool.

00:10:55.950 --> 00:10:58.070
So I mailed the actual envelope.

00:10:58.070 --> 00:11:01.506
This is all I have left, and
he never sent me anything.

00:11:01.506 --> 00:11:05.630
So Adam Savage.

00:11:05.630 --> 00:11:07.200
OK.

00:11:07.200 --> 00:11:08.950
So planets-- how do
you find planets?

00:11:08.950 --> 00:11:12.180
Well, people have been
finding planets like crazy

00:11:12.180 --> 00:11:13.067
in the last decade.

00:11:13.067 --> 00:11:15.150
One way to do it, the first
way that really worked

00:11:15.150 --> 00:11:16.040
was spectroscopic.

00:11:16.040 --> 00:11:18.660
You look at the spectral
lines of a star,

00:11:18.660 --> 00:11:20.720
and the recoil kind
of going around

00:11:20.720 --> 00:11:24.360
gives you a Doppler shift,
periodic Doppler shift.

00:11:24.360 --> 00:11:25.620
It's not so easy to do.

00:11:25.620 --> 00:11:27.090
There's turbulence on the star.

00:11:27.090 --> 00:11:29.067
You have to do this
very precisely.

00:11:29.067 --> 00:11:31.150
They threw an [INAUDIBLE]
absorption cell in there

00:11:31.150 --> 00:11:33.100
to give calibrated lines
to sort of compensate

00:11:33.100 --> 00:11:34.539
for everything that goes wrong.

00:11:34.539 --> 00:11:36.580
And then you look at the
Doppler shift over time,

00:11:36.580 --> 00:11:39.570
and here's an example
of a pretty heavy planet

00:11:39.570 --> 00:11:42.440
and a pretty slow orbit
around another star.

00:11:42.440 --> 00:11:46.140
You see this one has been going
on for about 10 or 12 years.

00:11:46.140 --> 00:11:47.900
You see about one full cycle.

00:11:47.900 --> 00:11:49.830
So this is the radial
velocity method.

00:11:49.830 --> 00:11:52.820
It has a strong bias
toward heavy close

00:11:52.820 --> 00:11:54.840
in planets, close in
because it goes rapidly,

00:11:54.840 --> 00:11:56.280
and you get to see
several cycles.

00:11:56.280 --> 00:11:59.650
Heavy, because you get
a big recoil velocity.

00:11:59.650 --> 00:12:01.830
Actually, the close in also
gives you more velocity.

00:12:01.830 --> 00:12:05.172
So what it tends to
favor, heavy close in.

00:12:05.172 --> 00:12:07.380
That is hot Jupiters, and
the very first planet found

00:12:07.380 --> 00:12:09.850
was that the Jupiter
in a several-day orbit.

00:12:09.850 --> 00:12:10.900
Completely unexpected.

00:12:10.900 --> 00:12:12.570
We don't have those things here.

00:12:12.570 --> 00:12:14.610
And so people start
to wonder, do we

00:12:14.610 --> 00:12:16.330
live in the weird
planetary system?

00:12:16.330 --> 00:12:19.140
In fact, the whole universe
out there is hot Jupiters.

00:12:19.140 --> 00:12:21.410
But no, it's really
a selection effect,

00:12:21.410 --> 00:12:25.430
and when you do more
careful measurements

00:12:25.430 --> 00:12:29.550
and try to dig down into the
harder to detect planets,

00:12:29.550 --> 00:12:31.930
you actually find that
Earth-like planets

00:12:31.930 --> 00:12:32.680
are rather common.

00:12:32.680 --> 00:12:34.090
Now I have a little
bit of stuff on this.

00:12:34.090 --> 00:12:34.600
Let's see.

00:12:34.600 --> 00:12:37.470
Here's a graph that was
put together, actually

00:12:37.470 --> 00:12:40.580
by a former student
of mine in SETI,

00:12:40.580 --> 00:12:44.970
and he's become a big stick
in the business of Exo-Earth.

00:12:44.970 --> 00:12:47.050
And looking at a
bunch of stuff, this

00:12:47.050 --> 00:12:48.550
was the radial
velocity measurements

00:12:48.550 --> 00:12:50.800
and the spectroscopic
thing that I just showed.

00:12:50.800 --> 00:12:52.890
The fact is that-- and
what he's plotting here

00:12:52.890 --> 00:12:57.560
is mass here or minimum mass,
because it depends on-- all

00:12:57.560 --> 00:13:00.280
you can see is what-- if
the thing is inclined,

00:13:00.280 --> 00:13:04.909
then you only get the
trigonometric projection

00:13:04.909 --> 00:13:05.450
of the thing.

00:13:05.450 --> 00:13:09.250
But here would be an
Earth mass down here.

00:13:09.250 --> 00:13:11.770
And what you see, this
part here that's all blue

00:13:11.770 --> 00:13:14.160
is basically the search
is incomplete down there.

00:13:14.160 --> 00:13:17.290
In fact, it's 0% complete,
because it's really hard

00:13:17.290 --> 00:13:19.760
to see slow light planets.

00:13:19.760 --> 00:13:21.470
But you could take
what you have here

00:13:21.470 --> 00:13:23.630
and extrapolate based
on the incompleteness,

00:13:23.630 --> 00:13:26.760
and from that, you can get a
measure of what's down there.

00:13:26.760 --> 00:13:29.987
And from extrapolation, which
is admittedly a bit hazardous,

00:13:29.987 --> 00:13:32.070
you get something like a
quarter of sun-like stars

00:13:32.070 --> 00:13:37.230
harbor a close in planet
of Earth-like mass.

00:13:37.230 --> 00:13:39.730
So more recently,
this other technique,

00:13:39.730 --> 00:13:42.810
which is of transits, so a
planet goes in front of a star,

00:13:42.810 --> 00:13:44.852
and if we happen to be in
the plane of the orbit,

00:13:44.852 --> 00:13:47.059
then we're going to see a
little dimming of the star.

00:13:47.059 --> 00:13:47.590
Not much.

00:13:47.590 --> 00:13:49.090
Look at the scale
on the left there.

00:13:49.090 --> 00:13:53.094
So we're seeing five
parts in 10,000,

00:13:53.094 --> 00:13:54.260
and that's a pretty big one.

00:13:54.260 --> 00:13:55.560
And you get this
periodic, and this

00:13:55.560 --> 00:13:57.518
is a star with a period
of, I don't know, looks

00:13:57.518 --> 00:14:01.200
like 40 days there, Kepler 10.

00:14:01.200 --> 00:14:02.320
So what have I got here?

00:14:02.320 --> 00:14:05.520
And based on this kind
of stuff, Kepler data,

00:14:05.520 --> 00:14:07.530
we can try to back
out of this bias.

00:14:07.530 --> 00:14:10.980
So here is the orbital period,
and again, we favor short ones.

00:14:10.980 --> 00:14:13.940
And here's radius or
mass-- two graphs here.

00:14:13.940 --> 00:14:15.960
And again, we favor
a lot of mass.

00:14:15.960 --> 00:14:19.034
So it's complete out
here in these regions.

00:14:19.034 --> 00:14:21.450
But down in this corner here,
that's the hard place to be.

00:14:21.450 --> 00:14:22.580
And this is where we live.

00:14:22.580 --> 00:14:27.950
We live right here, one radius
and 365 and a quarter days,

00:14:27.950 --> 00:14:29.860
except we make a correction
every four years.

00:14:29.860 --> 00:14:31.100
That's the four days.

00:14:31.100 --> 00:14:34.540
We make a correction every
100 years, or 300s out of 400.

00:14:34.540 --> 00:14:35.850
You know about that stuff?

00:14:35.850 --> 00:14:38.230
Most people don't live long
enough to care about it.

00:14:38.230 --> 00:14:39.420
Astronomers worry
about it, because we've

00:14:39.420 --> 00:14:41.128
got to keep track
going all the way back.

00:14:41.128 --> 00:14:43.140
Anyway, this is the
impossible place to go,

00:14:43.140 --> 00:14:44.750
but we can try to
extrapolate and see

00:14:44.750 --> 00:14:48.680
what you can do with this,
and people have done that.

00:14:48.680 --> 00:14:51.650
The ones that are hardest
to see, we've tried hard.

00:14:51.650 --> 00:14:56.790
And here's four examples from
Astrophysical Journal, 2012.

00:14:56.790 --> 00:14:59.030
Again, this is my student here.

00:14:59.030 --> 00:15:00.219
SETI is not a dead end.

00:15:00.219 --> 00:15:01.760
You learn lots of
cool stuff, and you

00:15:01.760 --> 00:15:03.340
can do other things with it.

00:15:03.340 --> 00:15:06.780
Here's four Earth-like--
closest to Earth-like planet.

00:15:06.780 --> 00:15:09.120
These things have a radius
of between two and three

00:15:09.120 --> 00:15:12.915
times Earth's radius, and this
is the kind of dimming you get.

00:15:12.915 --> 00:15:15.040
And you see again, we're
pretty small numbers here.

00:15:15.040 --> 00:15:16.420
These are fractional
percent that

00:15:16.420 --> 00:15:18.556
have been [INAUDIBLE] here.

00:15:18.556 --> 00:15:20.180
So that's another
way to do this thing.

00:15:20.180 --> 00:15:20.679
Now wait.

00:15:20.679 --> 00:15:25.162
It says here I've got
another slide in here.

00:15:25.162 --> 00:15:26.120
Must be here somewhere.

00:15:26.120 --> 00:15:27.020
Let's see.

00:15:27.020 --> 00:15:28.540
Got it down.

00:15:28.540 --> 00:15:31.250
Anyway, here's a picture
based on the Kepler

00:15:31.250 --> 00:15:35.580
stuff, the transits of what we
found, as of a few years ago.

00:15:35.580 --> 00:15:37.330
And here's where we want to be.

00:15:37.330 --> 00:15:38.880
And again, it's a
hard extrapolation,

00:15:38.880 --> 00:15:41.790
but the best people have
been able to do-- backing out

00:15:41.790 --> 00:15:45.550
the selection effects is
that there's plenty of Earths

00:15:45.550 --> 00:15:46.390
out there.

00:15:46.390 --> 00:15:49.610
Here's one more graph, again,
of that same incompleteness.

00:15:49.610 --> 00:15:52.150
Here, it's orbital period
versus radius again.

00:15:52.150 --> 00:15:53.670
And again, Earth
would be out here

00:15:53.670 --> 00:15:57.130
about where my arrow
is right there, 365.

00:15:57.130 --> 00:15:59.650
So Earth-like
planets are common.

00:15:59.650 --> 00:16:04.200
Again, doing the
extrapolation, 10%, maybe 20%,

00:16:04.200 --> 00:16:06.800
depending upon how you do
this, and we will know more

00:16:06.800 --> 00:16:10.740
when we have more data, and when
we have new missions like tests

00:16:10.740 --> 00:16:13.746
and some other things going up.

00:16:13.746 --> 00:16:15.620
So there's all reason
to believe that there's

00:16:15.620 --> 00:16:18.690
plenty of planets out there,
and let me switch gears

00:16:18.690 --> 00:16:21.800
now and just talk about
a different parameter

00:16:21.800 --> 00:16:25.086
than space, which is time.

00:16:25.086 --> 00:16:28.130
You might ask, has there
been time for them to evolve?

00:16:28.130 --> 00:16:29.430
Are they as smart as we are?

00:16:29.430 --> 00:16:32.280
Are they as smart
people at Google?

00:16:32.280 --> 00:16:35.189
So let me just show you
my little timeline thing.

00:16:35.189 --> 00:16:36.980
Astronomers love to do
this kind of stuff--

00:16:36.980 --> 00:16:39.090
give you the astronomical
perspective, which

00:16:39.090 --> 00:16:41.590
is everything you know, everyone
you know is the thinnest

00:16:41.590 --> 00:16:42.804
slice of time possible.

00:16:42.804 --> 00:16:44.720
I think for you guys,
this is kind of obvious,

00:16:44.720 --> 00:16:45.720
but anyway, here we are.

00:16:45.720 --> 00:16:50.030
Big Bang-- Earth's sun
and the whole solar system

00:16:50.030 --> 00:16:52.950
formed about four and
1/2 billion years ago.

00:16:52.950 --> 00:16:54.750
And what we do is
expand that to one day.

00:16:54.750 --> 00:16:56.840
So if we call that
one day, we can

00:16:56.840 --> 00:16:58.800
talk about when events
happened in this day.

00:16:58.800 --> 00:17:01.550
The day started when the Sun and
Earth were born, approximately.

00:17:01.550 --> 00:17:03.030
So life arises early on Earth.

00:17:03.030 --> 00:17:05.125
Look at that-- 5:00
in the morning.

00:17:05.125 --> 00:17:06.660
The Sun wasn't even up yet.

00:17:06.660 --> 00:17:10.540
Well, that's a bit
of a mixed metaphor.

00:17:10.540 --> 00:17:12.589
But life didn't get
interesting until a few hours

00:17:12.589 --> 00:17:15.880
before midnight, so now
we'll expand that last hour.

00:17:15.880 --> 00:17:17.319
Here we are at the last hour.

00:17:17.319 --> 00:17:20.730
Dinosaurs went extinct about
20 minutes before midnight.

00:17:20.730 --> 00:17:22.490
That's 65 million years ago.

00:17:22.490 --> 00:17:23.460
So where's the action?

00:17:23.460 --> 00:17:28.350
Well, the action's really in the
last minute, the last minute.

00:17:28.350 --> 00:17:28.850
Let's see.

00:17:28.850 --> 00:17:31.350
A minute is-- well, it's
50,000 years per second,

00:17:31.350 --> 00:17:33.140
so you can figure this out.

00:17:33.140 --> 00:17:35.300
It's a few million years.

00:17:35.300 --> 00:17:37.900
Here's the Neanderthals.

00:17:37.900 --> 00:17:40.162
That was about
100,000 years ago.

00:17:40.162 --> 00:17:42.620
Maybe things were happening
here, but not very interesting.

00:17:42.620 --> 00:17:45.490
Certainly not for
Google kind of interest.

00:17:45.490 --> 00:17:49.364
So let's take the last second,
so a second is 50,000 years.

00:17:49.364 --> 00:17:50.780
Now things are
starting to happen.

00:17:50.780 --> 00:17:53.770
10,000 years ago-- agriculture.

00:17:53.770 --> 00:17:55.770
And recorded history
basically 5,000 years ago,

00:17:55.770 --> 00:17:56.394
but look at it.

00:17:56.394 --> 00:17:58.817
It's a tenth of a
second before midnight.

00:17:58.817 --> 00:18:00.400
Does that give you
an interesting idea

00:18:00.400 --> 00:18:03.890
of the compression of time or
expansion of time or whatever?

00:18:03.890 --> 00:18:07.440
Anyway, let's take the
last tenth of a second.

00:18:07.440 --> 00:18:09.700
Now things are happening.

00:18:09.700 --> 00:18:11.440
Here's Jesus, and
here's Columbus.

00:18:11.440 --> 00:18:12.550
And here's the
American Revolution,

00:18:12.550 --> 00:18:14.299
but it's sort of getting
squeezed in here.

00:18:14.299 --> 00:18:16.900
Marconi was two milliseconds
before midnight.

00:18:16.900 --> 00:18:19.480
And lasers and radio
telescopes and all the stuff

00:18:19.480 --> 00:18:21.030
that we think you
need to communicate

00:18:21.030 --> 00:18:23.682
is one millisecond
before midnight.

00:18:23.682 --> 00:18:25.140
I don't have any
more milliseconds,

00:18:25.140 --> 00:18:30.780
but 20 microseconds
is a Moore law factor

00:18:30.780 --> 00:18:34.120
of two doubly on this scale.

00:18:34.120 --> 00:18:38.060
And our timeline
for technical people

00:18:38.060 --> 00:18:40.760
is one or two years,
everything changes.

00:18:40.760 --> 00:18:44.230
How's your 10-year-old
laptop doing?

00:18:44.230 --> 00:18:51.010
So what's the takeaway
besides this is totally cool?

00:18:51.010 --> 00:18:53.770
I think the takeaway is if
we find anybody out there,

00:18:53.770 --> 00:18:55.880
and if they can
communicate at all,

00:18:55.880 --> 00:18:59.089
they're going to be in this
little millisecond just barely.

00:18:59.089 --> 00:19:00.880
But they can be anywhere
to the right where

00:19:00.880 --> 00:19:02.999
the question mark here is.

00:19:02.999 --> 00:19:04.790
In other words, anybody
we communicate with

00:19:04.790 --> 00:19:08.600
is-- anyone out there is
either incredibly dumb,

00:19:08.600 --> 00:19:11.390
or they're so advanced that
they're going to blow us away.

00:19:11.390 --> 00:19:13.972
And so in fact, if you ask
what should we be looking for,

00:19:13.972 --> 00:19:15.930
we're looking for
civilizations that can really

00:19:15.930 --> 00:19:17.060
do pretty amazing stuff.

00:19:17.060 --> 00:19:18.690
They can do magic
with communications

00:19:18.690 --> 00:19:20.350
and know all about it.

00:19:20.350 --> 00:19:23.330
And if they're interested
in communicating with us,

00:19:23.330 --> 00:19:27.020
it's not going to be to learn
about Maxwell's equations

00:19:27.020 --> 00:19:30.300
or how you make cool
gallium arsenide stuff

00:19:30.300 --> 00:19:33.550
or how you take over the whole
world with Google and Amazon.

00:19:33.550 --> 00:19:36.380
It's going to be about
what's your culture like?

00:19:36.380 --> 00:19:37.936
What wars are you
fighting this year?

00:19:40.460 --> 00:19:43.460
Tell me about Bach and Picasso
and that kind of stuff,

00:19:43.460 --> 00:19:44.460
Beatles.

00:19:44.460 --> 00:19:47.680
So that's sort of an
interesting perspective.

00:19:47.680 --> 00:19:48.180
Let's see.

00:19:48.180 --> 00:19:49.490
What have I got here?

00:19:49.490 --> 00:19:50.200
Radio works.

00:19:50.200 --> 00:19:51.640
Anything else?

00:19:51.640 --> 00:19:53.967
So I showed you before that
radio is pretty efficient,

00:19:53.967 --> 00:19:56.050
and just to set the stage
for some of the searches

00:19:56.050 --> 00:19:57.930
we've done, so is optical.

00:19:57.930 --> 00:20:01.200
And this was something it
recognized by Charlie Townes

00:20:01.200 --> 00:20:03.410
just a year after the
invention of the laser when

00:20:03.410 --> 00:20:05.790
he wrote a little paper
about communication.

00:20:05.790 --> 00:20:08.930
So state of the art laser
is really a bright thing,

00:20:08.930 --> 00:20:12.340
and it's coherent, so if you
use a large mirror to make

00:20:12.340 --> 00:20:15.800
a collimated beam and
shine that out somewhere,

00:20:15.800 --> 00:20:17.970
then someone in
that line of sight--

00:20:17.970 --> 00:20:20.630
and let's assume they cannot
distinguish our planet where

00:20:20.630 --> 00:20:23.440
we're transmitting this
from, from our star--

00:20:23.440 --> 00:20:26.320
will see the starlight, but
during the time of the laser

00:20:26.320 --> 00:20:28.700
flash, the star will appear
to get much brighter.

00:20:28.700 --> 00:20:30.590
In fact, about a
factor of 10,000.

00:20:30.590 --> 00:20:31.626
Here's the nerd box.

00:20:31.626 --> 00:20:32.600
Well, let's see.

00:20:32.600 --> 00:20:33.720
Here's some laser thing.

00:20:33.720 --> 00:20:37.504
Here's a little wimpy helium
neon laser of ancient times,

00:20:37.504 --> 00:20:39.420
but here's sort of
something a little fancier.

00:20:39.420 --> 00:20:44.085
This is a NIF-type laser that's
meant to put out a petawatt.

00:20:44.085 --> 00:20:45.710
People know how to
design these things.

00:20:45.710 --> 00:20:47.126
They don't know
how to build them.

00:20:47.126 --> 00:20:48.770
And here's a graph
of laser power

00:20:48.770 --> 00:20:51.880
through the ages, where the
ages begin in the '70s here.

00:20:51.880 --> 00:20:54.020
Again, that's only
milliseconds on the time--

00:20:54.020 --> 00:20:56.200
not even a millisecond
on the time scales

00:20:56.200 --> 00:20:57.200
that anyone cares about.

00:20:57.200 --> 00:20:59.620
Here's the most powerful
lasers over time.

00:20:59.620 --> 00:21:02.800
And then it started
shooting up here after 1990.

00:21:02.800 --> 00:21:04.800
Here's this petawatt
laser that was actually

00:21:04.800 --> 00:21:07.899
realized in 1996 at Livermore.

00:21:07.899 --> 00:21:10.440
This little dashed line here,
just for interest-- by the way,

00:21:10.440 --> 00:21:12.160
this is a super Moore's law.

00:21:12.160 --> 00:21:16.440
We go two orders of magnitude
in just a few years.

00:21:16.440 --> 00:21:17.650
What's this dashed line?

00:21:17.650 --> 00:21:21.320
This is the world's total
electric power production,

00:21:21.320 --> 00:21:24.910
and I know this-- see, this is
the California energy crisis.

00:21:24.910 --> 00:21:26.440
Do you remember that thing?

00:21:26.440 --> 00:21:28.449
When Enron sort
of took them down.

00:21:28.449 --> 00:21:30.740
And I drew this graph based
on the data point from here

00:21:30.740 --> 00:21:32.910
and a data point from
here, straight line.

00:21:32.910 --> 00:21:34.160
It's the easiest approximate--

00:21:34.160 --> 00:21:35.690
[LAUGHTER]

00:21:35.690 --> 00:21:37.200
Anyway, these are
powerful pulses.

00:21:37.200 --> 00:21:39.158
It's only a few nanoseconds,
but what the heck?

00:21:39.158 --> 00:21:40.860
So here's the nerd box.

00:21:40.860 --> 00:21:43.120
We take one of these
diode-pumped solid-state

00:21:43.120 --> 00:21:43.620
lasers.

00:21:43.620 --> 00:21:51.440
It's in a terbium doped
strontium flora appetite,

00:21:51.440 --> 00:21:52.950
if you're into that stuff.

00:21:52.950 --> 00:21:53.717
I'm not.

00:21:53.717 --> 00:21:55.550
And imagine, they're
doing the transmitting.

00:21:55.550 --> 00:21:57.010
Remember, they're
smarter than us.

00:21:57.010 --> 00:21:58.050
We're not going to
do the hard work.

00:21:58.050 --> 00:21:59.466
We're just going
to look for this.

00:21:59.466 --> 00:22:01.240
So here they are,
and they shine it out

00:22:01.240 --> 00:22:03.550
with a Keck-type
telescope, and they send

00:22:03.550 --> 00:22:04.990
this diffraction limited beam.

00:22:04.990 --> 00:22:07.584
And here we look with our
Keck, and assuming they only

00:22:07.584 --> 00:22:09.000
have 10-meter
telescopes is really

00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:10.350
a very conservative assumption.

00:22:10.350 --> 00:22:12.084
These guys are good.

00:22:12.084 --> 00:22:13.250
Anyway, here's what you get.

00:22:13.250 --> 00:22:14.130
You get lots of equations.

00:22:14.130 --> 00:22:14.880
You count photons.

00:22:14.880 --> 00:22:17.170
You fiddle around, even
throw in some reality

00:22:17.170 --> 00:22:21.056
here like extinction, and get
the pi squared over 16 right.

00:22:21.056 --> 00:22:23.680
There might be someone out there
who actually cares about that.

00:22:23.680 --> 00:22:26.460
And it turns out what you
get at 1,000 light years,

00:22:26.460 --> 00:22:28.490
you get about 1,000
photons per pulse,

00:22:28.490 --> 00:22:31.650
per three-nanosecond pulse.

00:22:31.650 --> 00:22:34.060
And the stellar background,
you say, what about the star?

00:22:34.060 --> 00:22:35.540
Isn't that putting out light?

00:22:35.540 --> 00:22:37.930
Sure, but in a nanosecond,
it doesn't do much.

00:22:37.930 --> 00:22:41.990
It puts out 3 times 10 to the
minus 2 photons per nanosecond.

00:22:41.990 --> 00:22:44.450
So you get about 1/10 of
a photon from the star,

00:22:44.450 --> 00:22:47.200
and you get 1,000
photons from the laser.

00:22:47.200 --> 00:22:48.230
So 10,000 to one.

00:22:48.230 --> 00:22:49.260
Not bad.

00:22:49.260 --> 00:22:52.490
And by the way, this is
independent of distance.

00:22:52.490 --> 00:22:54.127
Inverse square, inverse square.

00:22:54.127 --> 00:22:54.960
You can't beat that.

00:22:54.960 --> 00:22:56.960
So lasers are OK.

00:22:56.960 --> 00:22:57.910
Lasers are OK.

00:22:57.910 --> 00:22:59.534
So let me tell you
about some searches.

00:22:59.534 --> 00:23:01.326
Oh, a little silly slide here.

00:23:01.326 --> 00:23:02.700
You know, what
other wavelengths?

00:23:02.700 --> 00:23:04.050
Well, if you want to
do it from the ground,

00:23:04.050 --> 00:23:05.758
you've got to get
through the atmosphere.

00:23:05.758 --> 00:23:09.510
And that pretty much limits
you to the atmospheric windows.

00:23:09.510 --> 00:23:10.720
How am I doing for time here?

00:23:10.720 --> 00:23:12.553
Well, we'll just speed
up here a little bit.

00:23:12.553 --> 00:23:15.431
This is going too slow, right?

00:23:15.431 --> 00:23:17.430
There's the radio window
and the optical window.

00:23:17.430 --> 00:23:21.030
This is actually a nice
drawing done by Ed Purcell.

00:23:21.030 --> 00:23:24.330
Again, this is a wonderful
guy from Harvard.

00:23:24.330 --> 00:23:27.580
And astronomers exploit
these things with telescopes.

00:23:27.580 --> 00:23:29.550
This is the optical window.

00:23:29.550 --> 00:23:30.500
So do humans.

00:23:30.500 --> 00:23:32.170
That's why we have eyes.

00:23:32.170 --> 00:23:35.030
If the atmosphere were
opaque in the visible,

00:23:35.030 --> 00:23:37.840
it would be kind of
silly to have eyes.

00:23:37.840 --> 00:23:39.550
Nature understood that.

00:23:39.550 --> 00:23:41.800
In the radio, we build
radio telescopes.

00:23:41.800 --> 00:23:43.370
And here's our little
one at Harvard.

00:23:43.370 --> 00:23:45.090
Actually looks
bigger than Arecibo.

00:23:45.090 --> 00:23:46.450
This is Arecibo.

00:23:46.450 --> 00:23:48.020
This is 1,000 feet.

00:23:48.020 --> 00:23:49.200
This is 84-foot.

00:23:49.200 --> 00:23:49.950
This is my son.

00:23:49.950 --> 00:23:51.430
Can you see him down there?

00:23:51.430 --> 00:23:52.810
He's about six pixels high.

00:23:52.810 --> 00:23:55.220
He was six years old.

00:23:55.220 --> 00:23:57.581
He's a year per pixel.

00:23:57.581 --> 00:23:59.080
And you might ask
the question, what

00:23:59.080 --> 00:24:00.246
about the analog of the eye?

00:24:00.246 --> 00:24:02.480
Why don't humans have antennas?

00:24:02.480 --> 00:24:03.875
I don't know.

00:24:03.875 --> 00:24:05.750
I wonder if there's
other creatures that can.

00:24:05.750 --> 00:24:08.760
That could be really helpful in
a dense fog or, I don't know,

00:24:08.760 --> 00:24:11.150
in the woods where you don't
have direct line of sight.

00:24:11.150 --> 00:24:14.060
Anyway, and remember, these are
very efficient communications.

00:24:14.060 --> 00:24:15.980
A trillionth of the
energy of a snowflake

00:24:15.980 --> 00:24:19.570
gets good communication
over these distances.

00:24:19.570 --> 00:24:22.940
Here's the first detection
of radio waves in space.

00:24:22.940 --> 00:24:24.840
This is Jansky in 1931.

00:24:24.840 --> 00:24:26.800
He was working for
the Bell system.

00:24:26.800 --> 00:24:29.410
Bell system in those days
owned the telephone networks.

00:24:29.410 --> 00:24:31.220
You may not remember
back that far.

00:24:31.220 --> 00:24:33.350
When I was a kid, you
had your dial phone.

00:24:33.350 --> 00:24:35.120
It was owned by the
Bell system, and you

00:24:35.120 --> 00:24:37.790
couldn't plug your own phone
in if you could even find one.

00:24:37.790 --> 00:24:38.630
They owned it.

00:24:38.630 --> 00:24:41.030
I took one apart, but I had
to put it back together,

00:24:41.030 --> 00:24:43.480
because it was the
only phone we had.

00:24:43.480 --> 00:24:47.265
Anyway, Bell system was
also doing transatlantic

00:24:47.265 --> 00:24:49.390
communications, and there
they were getting static,

00:24:49.390 --> 00:24:50.240
and they wanted
to find out what's

00:24:50.240 --> 00:24:51.320
the origin of the static.

00:24:51.320 --> 00:24:53.140
Of course, a lot of
it was thunderstorms.

00:24:53.140 --> 00:24:55.790
But there was this irreducible
hiss in the background

00:24:55.790 --> 00:25:00.220
that Jansky noticed, and being
a smart guy, he didn't neglect.

00:25:00.220 --> 00:25:01.650
That's how penicillin was found.

00:25:01.650 --> 00:25:04.480
It was a rotten cantaloupe
in a marketplace.

00:25:04.480 --> 00:25:05.960
Turned out to be
pretty cool stuff.

00:25:05.960 --> 00:25:08.459
Not the cantaloupe, but the
fact that some of the mold

00:25:08.459 --> 00:25:10.750
wasn't growing in certain
places around the cantaloupe,

00:25:10.750 --> 00:25:13.010
and there was a little
penicillin there instead.

00:25:13.010 --> 00:25:17.410
Anyway, he noticed that this
stuff was coming every day

00:25:17.410 --> 00:25:19.040
from-- when he
pointed to this thing,

00:25:19.040 --> 00:25:21.700
it was diurnal, 24 hours.

00:25:21.700 --> 00:25:23.490
But then when he
looked more carefully,

00:25:23.490 --> 00:25:24.840
he thought maybe it was the sun.

00:25:24.840 --> 00:25:25.960
It wasn't 24 hours.

00:25:25.960 --> 00:25:31.450
It was 23 hours and 56 minutes,
so you think a day is 24 hours,

00:25:31.450 --> 00:25:32.460
don't you?

00:25:32.460 --> 00:25:32.970
Except wait.

00:25:32.970 --> 00:25:33.553
I'm at Google.

00:25:33.553 --> 00:25:36.080
You know a day is not
24 hours, don't you?

00:25:36.080 --> 00:25:37.580
You know how long
it takes the Earth

00:25:37.580 --> 00:25:40.660
to rotate once on its axis?

00:25:40.660 --> 00:25:42.170
23 hours and 56 minutes.

00:25:42.170 --> 00:25:44.670
You're fooled by the fact that
we're going around the sun,

00:25:44.670 --> 00:25:46.440
and you think the sun is in
the same place every day.

00:25:46.440 --> 00:25:47.439
But of course, it's not.

00:25:47.439 --> 00:25:48.450
We're going around it.

00:25:48.450 --> 00:25:49.731
So anyway, sidereal time.

00:25:49.731 --> 00:25:50.730
He figured that one out.

00:25:50.730 --> 00:25:51.920
He's a smart guy.

00:25:51.920 --> 00:25:54.620
This was continuum
radio waves from space.

00:25:54.620 --> 00:25:58.680
This is basically the
birth of radio astronomy.

00:25:58.680 --> 00:26:01.830
Here's a little later, a
birth of spectral line radio

00:26:01.830 --> 00:26:02.800
astronomy.

00:26:02.800 --> 00:26:05.200
This is the fourth floor
of Lyman Lab at Harvard,

00:26:05.200 --> 00:26:08.300
and this is Doc Ewan--
Harold Ewan-- with his horn

00:26:08.300 --> 00:26:11.380
antenna looking for a mission
from neutral hydrogen.

00:26:11.380 --> 00:26:12.876
This is 1951.

00:26:12.876 --> 00:26:14.500
This is what antennas
looked like then,

00:26:14.500 --> 00:26:16.377
sort of a hacked
together piece of stuff.

00:26:16.377 --> 00:26:17.960
Look at little patches
stuck in there.

00:26:17.960 --> 00:26:21.670
So this is basically
plywood with copper sheeting

00:26:21.670 --> 00:26:22.360
stuck on there.

00:26:22.360 --> 00:26:26.510
This thing here is actually
a thing that you flip over

00:26:26.510 --> 00:26:29.200
to cover the aperture,
and the reason

00:26:29.200 --> 00:26:31.549
that Doc Ewan put
that there is that he

00:26:31.549 --> 00:26:32.590
didn't used to have that.

00:26:32.590 --> 00:26:34.465
And then in a rainstorm,
it filled up the lab

00:26:34.465 --> 00:26:38.441
with water, which he referred to
as his first signal from space.

00:26:38.441 --> 00:26:39.440
So he put that thing in.

00:26:39.440 --> 00:26:41.286
Here's what it looked
like on the other side

00:26:41.286 --> 00:26:42.410
of the wall coming in here.

00:26:42.410 --> 00:26:43.980
So here's the
waveguide coming in,

00:26:43.980 --> 00:26:47.040
and it goes the whole rack of
really fancy-looking equipment.

00:26:47.040 --> 00:26:50.960
This is radio astronomy 1951
style-- leftover war surplus

00:26:50.960 --> 00:26:52.480
local oscillators,
and look, it's

00:26:52.480 --> 00:26:54.770
even got earphones
so that Jodie Foster

00:26:54.770 --> 00:26:56.630
can listen for the signal.

00:26:56.630 --> 00:26:58.514
Anyway these guys
with a $500 grant,

00:26:58.514 --> 00:26:59.930
they did this
experiment, and they

00:26:59.930 --> 00:27:02.080
found the 21-centimeter
line from hydrogen

00:27:02.080 --> 00:27:06.160
and found the whole
spectral line thing.

00:27:06.160 --> 00:27:08.880
Nine years later, the Harvard
put up the 60-foot radio

00:27:08.880 --> 00:27:09.720
telescope.

00:27:09.720 --> 00:27:11.220
This is Purcell and
Ewan, and here's

00:27:11.220 --> 00:27:15.040
the horn that had made
the 1951 discovery.

00:27:15.040 --> 00:27:17.240
And here's that same
radio telescope pedestal

00:27:17.240 --> 00:27:19.680
with a larger dish
on it, now 84-foot.

00:27:19.680 --> 00:27:22.740
Again, with my
son there is 1983.

00:27:22.740 --> 00:27:24.350
So we press this
thing into service,

00:27:24.350 --> 00:27:28.580
and I guess I should say about
1960, this is about the time

00:27:28.580 --> 00:27:31.669
that people first started
looking seriously for microwave

00:27:31.669 --> 00:27:32.460
signals from space.

00:27:32.460 --> 00:27:36.400
And here's a shot of
Frank Drake's 84-foot.

00:27:36.400 --> 00:27:39.030
Coincidentally, the
same size as our dish.

00:27:39.030 --> 00:27:41.850
And here's Frank back
then, graduate student,

00:27:41.850 --> 00:27:43.840
and looked at two stars
for a month or two

00:27:43.840 --> 00:27:45.860
with a one channel radio.

00:27:45.860 --> 00:27:49.870
It says down here at the
bottom, we turned the telescope

00:27:49.870 --> 00:27:51.980
to epsilon eridani,
and then it happened.

00:27:51.980 --> 00:27:55.540
Wham, and as Frank likes
to say, all of a sudden out

00:27:55.540 --> 00:27:58.130
of the loudspeaker came
choo-choo-choo-choo,

00:27:58.130 --> 00:28:00.250
and they said, can
it be this easy?

00:28:00.250 --> 00:28:01.570
Turns out not to be this easy.

00:28:01.570 --> 00:28:02.960
It was a satellite.

00:28:02.960 --> 00:28:04.650
Could it be a satellite in 1960?

00:28:04.650 --> 00:28:07.000
It was something that
went choo-choo-choo.

00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:08.860
It was probably radar.

00:28:08.860 --> 00:28:12.460
Anyway, here's Frank a little
later at our telescope,

00:28:12.460 --> 00:28:15.544
a little older than when we
were looking for radio signals.

00:28:15.544 --> 00:28:17.960
Let me tell you-- oh, I've got
one more thing about Frank.

00:28:17.960 --> 00:28:18.626
He's a cool guy.

00:28:18.626 --> 00:28:21.230
He visited Harvard, and
we named our servers--

00:28:21.230 --> 00:28:25.890
that thing's a server--
after SETI people.

00:28:25.890 --> 00:28:28.220
So this one's called
Frank, so we said, Frank,

00:28:28.220 --> 00:28:29.610
will you autograph Frank?

00:28:29.610 --> 00:28:32.749
He said sure, so this
is the Drake equation.

00:28:32.749 --> 00:28:34.790
How many people have heard
of the Drake equation?

00:28:34.790 --> 00:28:35.301
Yeah, good.

00:28:35.301 --> 00:28:35.800
There it is.

00:28:35.800 --> 00:28:38.060
And Frank's trying to
think, what comes next?

00:28:38.060 --> 00:28:39.710
[GIBBERISH]

00:28:39.710 --> 00:28:41.320
Frank Drake-- he's quite amused.

00:28:41.320 --> 00:28:44.105
He's never been asked
to sign a server before.

00:28:47.390 --> 00:28:50.880
So we started looking for these
spectral lines from aliens,

00:28:50.880 --> 00:28:52.910
and we wanted more than
a one-channel receiver,

00:28:52.910 --> 00:28:55.900
which is what he used
for his search in 1960.

00:28:55.900 --> 00:28:59.170
And what we needed was a Fourier
transform type technique.

00:28:59.170 --> 00:29:02.710
So here's just a little bit
of nerd history on the Fourier

00:29:02.710 --> 00:29:05.350
transform, the fast
Fourier transform, which

00:29:05.350 --> 00:29:06.600
you guys all take for granted.

00:29:06.600 --> 00:29:08.690
It wasn't always forever.

00:29:08.690 --> 00:29:11.840
In fact, it was
rediscovered in the '60s,

00:29:11.840 --> 00:29:13.550
and here's a little
piece of the story.

00:29:13.550 --> 00:29:17.550
Dick Garwin, who was
at IBM, was the midwife

00:29:17.550 --> 00:29:20.420
between Cooley and Tukey,
and he describes this thing.

00:29:20.420 --> 00:29:24.220
And Garwin mentioned
to Tukey that he

00:29:24.220 --> 00:29:26.510
was competing Fourier
transforms and asked Tukey if he

00:29:26.510 --> 00:29:27.850
had a faster way of doing it.

00:29:27.850 --> 00:29:28.770
Tukey did.

00:29:28.770 --> 00:29:30.700
He described the
essence of the FFT.

00:29:30.700 --> 00:29:33.400
Garwin came to the computing
center to get it programmed,

00:29:33.400 --> 00:29:36.200
and as Cooley puts it--
I'll read it for you,

00:29:36.200 --> 00:29:38.280
because I probably read
faster than you read.

00:29:38.280 --> 00:29:39.480
"I was new at the
computing center.

00:29:39.480 --> 00:29:40.980
I was doing some
of my own research.

00:29:40.980 --> 00:29:43.500
Since I was the only one
with nothing important to do,

00:29:43.500 --> 00:29:44.730
they gave me this
problem to work out.

00:29:44.730 --> 00:29:47.146
It looked interesting, but I
thought that what I was doing

00:29:47.146 --> 00:29:47.980
was more important.

00:29:47.980 --> 00:29:49.813
However, with a little
prodding from Garwin,

00:29:49.813 --> 00:29:52.300
I got a program out in my
spare time and gave it to him.

00:29:52.300 --> 00:29:53.460
It was his problem,
and I thought

00:29:53.460 --> 00:29:55.126
I'll hear no more
about it and went back

00:29:55.126 --> 00:29:56.926
to doing some real work.

00:29:56.926 --> 00:29:58.425
The significance
of the factor n log

00:29:58.425 --> 00:30:01.140
n versus n squared was lost
on me, since I had never had

00:30:01.140 --> 00:30:04.420
any use for Fourier transforms.

00:30:04.420 --> 00:30:07.170
The experience since then has
given me quite an education,

00:30:07.170 --> 00:30:08.190
and when I realized
what happened,

00:30:08.190 --> 00:30:10.300
I told Garwin that if he had
any more ideas like that,

00:30:10.300 --> 00:30:11.790
I would be glad to
help him out again."

00:30:11.790 --> 00:30:13.165
So it's a wonderful
little thing,

00:30:13.165 --> 00:30:16.400
and Garwin describes-- I'll
send this thing off to David,

00:30:16.400 --> 00:30:17.720
and he can forward it around.

00:30:17.720 --> 00:30:20.470
But basically what happened
was that Garwin was sitting

00:30:20.470 --> 00:30:21.940
in a boring meeting,
and he noticed

00:30:21.940 --> 00:30:23.890
Tukey doing, as he
says, doing Fourier

00:30:23.890 --> 00:30:25.534
transforms with his left hand.

00:30:25.534 --> 00:30:27.450
He doesn't say whether
Tukey was right-handed,

00:30:27.450 --> 00:30:30.270
but I think that must be the
implication that this guy was

00:30:30.270 --> 00:30:32.790
so cool, he could do Fourier
transforms with one hand.

00:30:32.790 --> 00:30:35.970
Anyway, he asked, was there
anything that he knew about it?

00:30:35.970 --> 00:30:36.852
He said, yes, indeed.

00:30:36.852 --> 00:30:37.560
And there it was.

00:30:37.560 --> 00:30:41.010
And that's how it happened.

00:30:41.010 --> 00:30:43.815
So this is the '60s.

00:30:43.815 --> 00:30:45.190
We're back with
Frank Drake here,

00:30:45.190 --> 00:30:49.130
and where do you look
for these radial lines?

00:30:49.130 --> 00:30:51.360
And Cocconi and
Morrison-- Phil Morrison

00:30:51.360 --> 00:30:54.600
from just down the street there
at MIT-- looked into this.

00:30:54.600 --> 00:30:56.000
He was at Cornell at the time.

00:30:56.000 --> 00:30:56.990
Where should you look?

00:30:56.990 --> 00:30:59.290
Well, you look at the whole
radio frequency spectrum,

00:30:59.290 --> 00:31:01.780
and electromagnetic
radiation really

00:31:01.780 --> 00:31:04.030
is the way to go, sort of
by elimination of everything

00:31:04.030 --> 00:31:05.010
else we know about.

00:31:05.010 --> 00:31:07.570
And there's this one line,
this 21-centimeter line,

00:31:07.570 --> 00:31:10.170
the thing that was discovered
by Purcell and Ewan.

00:31:10.170 --> 00:31:13.359
And it's the marker out there.

00:31:13.359 --> 00:31:14.650
It's really the place you look.

00:31:14.650 --> 00:31:17.384
So these guys suggested
that's where you should look.

00:31:17.384 --> 00:31:19.300
It also happens to be
in a pretty quiet region

00:31:19.300 --> 00:31:20.740
of the radio and noise spectrum.

00:31:20.740 --> 00:31:23.090
Here's roughly what
sky noise looks

00:31:23.090 --> 00:31:24.930
like viewed from
down on Earth, so you

00:31:24.930 --> 00:31:26.400
get these atmospheric lines.

00:31:26.400 --> 00:31:28.350
The galaxy itself
makes a lot of noise,

00:31:28.350 --> 00:31:31.570
and here's this quiet region in
the gigahertz in the microwave,

00:31:31.570 --> 00:31:32.860
centimetric microwave.

00:31:32.860 --> 00:31:34.710
So that's where people look.

00:31:34.710 --> 00:31:38.560
And now let me show you a few
experiments in the 29 minutes

00:31:38.560 --> 00:31:42.590
and 40 seconds, 39 seconds,
38 seconds remaining.

00:31:42.590 --> 00:31:47.550
So I had a sabbatical in '78
and went down to Arecibo.

00:31:47.550 --> 00:31:51.289
Actually, I wrote a letter--
remember those days--

00:31:51.289 --> 00:31:53.080
to Frank Drake saying
that was interesting.

00:31:53.080 --> 00:31:54.870
Looking for life in Puerto Rico.

00:31:54.870 --> 00:31:55.820
He got the joke.

00:31:55.820 --> 00:32:00.880
And he sent me down there, and
I built this little system here

00:32:00.880 --> 00:32:02.837
that involved-- well,
actually, Arecibo

00:32:02.837 --> 00:32:05.170
has all kinds of receiver
things, and all you have to do

00:32:05.170 --> 00:32:06.086
is plug them together.

00:32:06.086 --> 00:32:09.540
So I did real time
digitizing of what's

00:32:09.540 --> 00:32:11.990
coming in off the
antenna and recorded this

00:32:11.990 --> 00:32:15.230
all on a tape, which
then got FFTs offline.

00:32:15.230 --> 00:32:19.220
Computer wasn't fast enough
to do 64k FFTs in real time

00:32:19.220 --> 00:32:21.460
at a kilo sample per second.

00:32:21.460 --> 00:32:22.920
Can you remember those days?

00:32:22.920 --> 00:32:26.900
I mean nowadays, your smartphone
will do mega channel FFTs

00:32:26.900 --> 00:32:29.320
in real time of
anything you like.

00:32:29.320 --> 00:32:31.400
And here's this Harris computer.

00:32:31.400 --> 00:32:34.170
I remember this is a curious
computer, a 24-bit word.

00:32:34.170 --> 00:32:35.270
Isn't that weird?

00:32:35.270 --> 00:32:38.090
And it had a disk drive,
which was the size of kind

00:32:38.090 --> 00:32:39.420
of a small refrigerator.

00:32:39.420 --> 00:32:40.685
And you stuck these things in.

00:32:40.685 --> 00:32:42.800
Do you remember
those top loading--

00:32:42.800 --> 00:32:45.620
and it held 20 megabytes.

00:32:45.620 --> 00:32:46.830
Megabytes.

00:32:46.830 --> 00:32:49.830
Not gigabytes, and
definitely not terabytes.

00:32:49.830 --> 00:32:51.980
And I remember one day
going back and forth

00:32:51.980 --> 00:32:54.490
on the Pulsar, which
was the name of our bus

00:32:54.490 --> 00:32:56.110
that drove us to this place.

00:32:56.110 --> 00:32:58.110
Calculating what you could
do with 20 megabytes,

00:32:58.110 --> 00:33:01.490
you could fit most of the text
of all the books in the Library

00:33:01.490 --> 00:33:05.121
of Congress onto one of those
giant 20-megabyte multi-disk

00:33:05.121 --> 00:33:05.620
things.

00:33:05.620 --> 00:33:08.750
That was exciting days.

00:33:08.750 --> 00:33:11.030
Here's how you built a
receiver in those days.

00:33:11.030 --> 00:33:12.959
That's me, actually.

00:33:12.959 --> 00:33:14.000
You put your hard hat on.

00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:15.249
That's mostly for the picture.

00:33:15.249 --> 00:33:17.115
But you basically
built a receiver.

00:33:17.115 --> 00:33:21.070
It had racks full of things
like mixers and attenuators

00:33:21.070 --> 00:33:22.550
and power level meters.

00:33:22.550 --> 00:33:25.770
You can see those two meters
and A to D converters.

00:33:25.770 --> 00:33:27.950
And you just plug them
together with BNC cables.

00:33:27.950 --> 00:33:30.380
You sling a bunch of
them over your neck,

00:33:30.380 --> 00:33:31.590
and you just plug them in.

00:33:31.590 --> 00:33:34.120
And you do it real quick,
because your telescope time

00:33:34.120 --> 00:33:35.100
is coming up.

00:33:35.100 --> 00:33:37.800
So I did a search down there,
actually looked at 250 stars.

00:33:37.800 --> 00:33:39.610
It was actually the
most sensitive search

00:33:39.610 --> 00:33:42.756
ever done, and kept that
record for about 20 years.

00:33:42.756 --> 00:33:44.130
It was also a very
narrow search.

00:33:44.130 --> 00:33:45.920
It only looked at
about one kilohertz

00:33:45.920 --> 00:33:48.980
centered on the hydrogen line
and corrected for the Earth's

00:33:48.980 --> 00:33:51.630
motion around the sun, assuming
that the folks out there

00:33:51.630 --> 00:33:54.610
sending to us don't know
what the Earth's doing,

00:33:54.610 --> 00:33:56.480
but they know what
the sun's doing.

00:33:56.480 --> 00:33:58.685
And it exploited a
very cute little way

00:33:58.685 --> 00:34:00.060
to get rid of
interference, which

00:34:00.060 --> 00:34:03.540
is that because the Earth's
turning-- the Earth does turn--

00:34:03.540 --> 00:34:06.540
the Doppler shift along any line
of sight is changing with time.

00:34:06.540 --> 00:34:08.280
And that means that
a frequency received

00:34:08.280 --> 00:34:11.094
from an external fixed
frequency oscillator

00:34:11.094 --> 00:34:12.760
appears to be changing
with time instead

00:34:12.760 --> 00:34:14.850
of changing Doppler shift.

00:34:14.850 --> 00:34:18.449
And it changes to the tune of
about-- at the hydrogen line

00:34:18.449 --> 00:34:21.120
frequency, it's about point
0.15 hertz per second.

00:34:21.120 --> 00:34:22.790
It's actually always going down.

00:34:22.790 --> 00:34:24.726
From the time a source
rises until it sets,

00:34:24.726 --> 00:34:26.100
the frequency is
always dropping,

00:34:26.100 --> 00:34:27.725
and when it's overhead,
that's the rate

00:34:27.725 --> 00:34:28.760
at which it's dropping.

00:34:28.760 --> 00:34:33.440
So what I was doing is 60-second
integrations, which gave me

00:34:33.440 --> 00:34:35.159
a resolution of 0.015 hertz.

00:34:35.159 --> 00:34:37.489
You know how Fourier works.

00:34:37.489 --> 00:34:41.110
But a fixed frequency
signal during that time

00:34:41.110 --> 00:34:42.780
would chirp about 10 hertz.

00:34:42.780 --> 00:34:45.710
So it actually would chirp
over about 600 channels,

00:34:45.710 --> 00:34:48.620
so unless you adjust
your receiving frequency

00:34:48.620 --> 00:34:52.750
to compensate for the
acceleration on the Earth's

00:34:52.750 --> 00:34:56.936
surface, a signal from space
will seem to be chirping,

00:34:56.936 --> 00:34:58.810
and everything on Earth,
all the interference

00:34:58.810 --> 00:35:02.400
will be fixed and make a
big forest of interference.

00:35:02.400 --> 00:35:04.712
But what do you is you
chirp your receiver.

00:35:04.712 --> 00:35:05.670
It's in here somewhere.

00:35:05.670 --> 00:35:06.685
Something's chirping.

00:35:06.685 --> 00:35:07.810
Does it show some chirping?

00:35:07.810 --> 00:35:08.309
Yeah, here.

00:35:08.309 --> 00:35:11.340
See, we're programming
this first LO.

00:35:11.340 --> 00:35:12.929
Also this guy.

00:35:12.929 --> 00:35:14.720
You compensate for
that, and the only thing

00:35:14.720 --> 00:35:16.178
that'll look like
a fixed frequency

00:35:16.178 --> 00:35:17.640
is stuff coming from space.

00:35:17.640 --> 00:35:19.272
So that was a cute technique.

00:35:19.272 --> 00:35:19.980
It really worked.

00:35:19.980 --> 00:35:20.990
We didn't see anything.

00:35:20.990 --> 00:35:23.142
That's the example of
a great search here.

00:35:23.142 --> 00:35:24.100
You don't see anything.

00:35:24.100 --> 00:35:25.380
Well, anyway.

00:35:25.380 --> 00:35:30.200
What happened after this search?

00:35:30.200 --> 00:35:31.807
I took the stuff
I built from there

00:35:31.807 --> 00:35:33.890
and converted it into what
I called Suitcase SETI.

00:35:33.890 --> 00:35:36.106
This was a little
portable apparatus.

00:35:36.106 --> 00:35:37.480
I'll show you what
it looks like.

00:35:37.480 --> 00:35:38.740
It basically looked like this.

00:35:38.740 --> 00:35:43.830
This is, again,
1980s technology.

00:35:43.830 --> 00:35:45.519
Here's a dual Fourier processor.

00:35:45.519 --> 00:35:46.060
Look at that.

00:35:46.060 --> 00:35:47.450
It's a whole rack.

00:35:47.450 --> 00:35:54.050
And it's got a couple of 68,000s
cranking away doing 128k FFts,

00:35:54.050 --> 00:35:56.750
and here's a machine
actually running Unix.

00:35:56.750 --> 00:36:00.580
In 1980, that was pretty hot
stuff, portable computer.

00:36:00.580 --> 00:36:02.586
It was made by a
company called WICAT

00:36:02.586 --> 00:36:03.710
that you've never heard of.

00:36:03.710 --> 00:36:06.940
That's the World Institute
for Computer Aided Teaching.

00:36:06.940 --> 00:36:08.130
Hm?

00:36:08.130 --> 00:36:10.387
How do you know about WICAT?

00:36:10.387 --> 00:36:10.970
Did you work--

00:36:10.970 --> 00:36:12.350
AUDIENCE: The early [INAUDIBLE].

00:36:12.350 --> 00:36:13.290
PAUL HOROWITZ: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:36:13.290 --> 00:36:14.110
So they had this machine.

00:36:14.110 --> 00:36:15.780
It only cost a few
thousand dollars,

00:36:15.780 --> 00:36:17.427
and it had a-- it was great.

00:36:17.427 --> 00:36:19.260
And here's a little
video cassette recorder.

00:36:19.260 --> 00:36:20.426
We put all our data on that.

00:36:20.426 --> 00:36:22.870
Anyway, here's the box of
the Fourier transformers.

00:36:22.870 --> 00:36:24.702
It's a bunch of 16k
memory chips here.

00:36:24.702 --> 00:36:26.410
There's a whole wire
wrapped on the back.

00:36:26.410 --> 00:36:28.120
Here's your 68,000 here.

00:36:28.120 --> 00:36:30.180
Here's a 16 by 16 multiplier.

00:36:30.180 --> 00:36:32.780
These things cost a few
hundred dollars back then.

00:36:32.780 --> 00:36:35.940
This is expensive stuff.

00:36:35.940 --> 00:36:39.151
Anyway, so Suitcase SETI
went down to Arecibo,

00:36:39.151 --> 00:36:41.150
and we looked at some
other frequencies of that.

00:36:41.150 --> 00:36:44.190
But then done with Arecibo,
came back to Harvard,

00:36:44.190 --> 00:36:46.550
and we discovered there's
this dish out there.

00:36:46.550 --> 00:36:48.920
This is in Harvard,
Massachusetts on the hillside.

00:36:48.920 --> 00:36:49.420
Or was.

00:36:49.420 --> 00:36:51.180
You can see it's kind
of pretty out there.

00:36:51.180 --> 00:36:53.638
And so what we did was we got
some money from the Planetary

00:36:53.638 --> 00:36:56.580
Society, and built the
thing called Sentinel.

00:36:56.580 --> 00:36:59.090
And we just took
this 84-foot dish

00:36:59.090 --> 00:37:00.910
and built a bunch
of RF electronics

00:37:00.910 --> 00:37:03.109
and made it look
like Arecibo to us.

00:37:03.109 --> 00:37:05.400
We had to build our own local
oscillators and all that,

00:37:05.400 --> 00:37:06.060
and here it is.

00:37:06.060 --> 00:37:09.360
And we built a system called
Sentinel and looked again

00:37:09.360 --> 00:37:10.719
at pretty narrow frequencies.

00:37:10.719 --> 00:37:12.010
Again, we didn't find anything.

00:37:12.010 --> 00:37:13.884
It has this wonderful
interference rejection.

00:37:13.884 --> 00:37:15.160
It rejects everything.

00:37:15.160 --> 00:37:16.742
You never find anything.

00:37:16.742 --> 00:37:17.700
So then what do you do?

00:37:17.700 --> 00:37:18.783
You build a bigger system.

00:37:18.783 --> 00:37:21.050
So we decided that we
needed more bandwidth.

00:37:21.050 --> 00:37:22.900
We really want to be
able to see not just

00:37:22.900 --> 00:37:25.670
signals that are corrected for
our helio center for the sun,

00:37:25.670 --> 00:37:27.940
but also for other
frames of reference

00:37:27.940 --> 00:37:31.940
like the galactic center
or the local standard rest

00:37:31.940 --> 00:37:34.650
or the cosmic background
standard of rest.

00:37:34.650 --> 00:37:36.680
So we built a
system called META.

00:37:36.680 --> 00:37:40.070
META stands for Mega Channel
Extraterrestrial Assay,

00:37:40.070 --> 00:37:42.050
and it had 8.4 million channels.

00:37:42.050 --> 00:37:45.779
And this was amazing for 19--
when was this-- about 1985.

00:37:45.779 --> 00:37:46.820
It was really impressive.

00:37:46.820 --> 00:37:47.944
There's our META processor.

00:37:47.944 --> 00:37:51.884
It had 128 68,000ths with a pile
of memory on each one and lots

00:37:51.884 --> 00:37:53.300
of block diagram-y
looking things.

00:37:53.300 --> 00:37:54.940
Here's a picture of
the control room.

00:37:54.940 --> 00:37:58.210
It's got two racks
here full of stuff,

00:37:58.210 --> 00:38:00.140
and you can't read
that, which is good,

00:38:00.140 --> 00:38:01.973
because it would be
embarrassing if you knew

00:38:01.973 --> 00:38:06.880
that it said META Supercomputer:
75 million instructions

00:38:06.880 --> 00:38:08.720
per second.

00:38:08.720 --> 00:38:11.210
You know, the Cray-1 wasn't
much faster than that.

00:38:11.210 --> 00:38:12.510
This was a supercomputer.

00:38:12.510 --> 00:38:16.262
This had 7,064k DRAM chips.

00:38:16.262 --> 00:38:17.220
I soldered them all in.

00:38:17.220 --> 00:38:18.920
I know.

00:38:18.920 --> 00:38:20.270
And they cost $3 apiece.

00:38:20.270 --> 00:38:25.250
We spent $21,000 to get
60 megabytes of memory.

00:38:25.250 --> 00:38:29.480
You can't imagine yourself in
this-- it was really like that.

00:38:29.480 --> 00:38:31.280
Anyway, so some more pictures.

00:38:31.280 --> 00:38:34.806
Here's a rack full of these
that had nine of these racks.

00:38:34.806 --> 00:38:36.430
Each one of those
has the memory on it.

00:38:36.430 --> 00:38:37.330
You can see that.

00:38:37.330 --> 00:38:38.770
And then it produced this stuff.

00:38:38.770 --> 00:38:40.690
This is, again, on
the WICAT screen,

00:38:40.690 --> 00:38:43.315
and it gave you
the whole spectrum.

00:38:43.315 --> 00:38:45.440
And then it sort of zoomed
in on the largest thing,

00:38:45.440 --> 00:38:47.023
and then it zoomed
in some more so you

00:38:47.023 --> 00:38:49.660
could see that at single
channel resolution here.

00:38:49.660 --> 00:38:51.720
And if it found
something big like this,

00:38:51.720 --> 00:38:53.940
then it put something
up on the screen,

00:38:53.940 --> 00:38:56.052
and a colleague of
mine, Bill Press,

00:38:56.052 --> 00:38:57.260
said, what's it going to say?

00:38:57.260 --> 00:38:59.570
And I said, oh, it'll say
big peak, eight sigma.

00:38:59.570 --> 00:39:01.300
And he said, no, no, no.

00:39:01.300 --> 00:39:03.360
He said, there's going
to be journalists there.

00:39:03.360 --> 00:39:04.740
Have it say
something impressive.

00:39:04.740 --> 00:39:05.490
I said, like what?

00:39:05.490 --> 00:39:09.950
Have it say, notify
operator immediately.

00:39:09.950 --> 00:39:12.320
Possible signal of
extraterrestrial origin.

00:39:12.320 --> 00:39:19.080
So there's Bill Press of
the Numerical Recipes fame.

00:39:19.080 --> 00:39:21.350
So this is what you
could do back then.

00:39:21.350 --> 00:39:22.909
It was hard work, but we did it.

00:39:22.909 --> 00:39:24.450
We didn't find
anything there either.

00:39:24.450 --> 00:39:26.570
Again, we had that same
interference rejection.

00:39:26.570 --> 00:39:29.410
I want to show you just
something about the times.

00:39:29.410 --> 00:39:32.540
So you think, oh, this
stuff seems so primitive.

00:39:32.540 --> 00:39:34.470
You can't believe that
it was hard to do.

00:39:34.470 --> 00:39:36.310
But let me just show you
how hard things were to do.

00:39:36.310 --> 00:39:37.656
Anybody recognize what this is?

00:39:42.790 --> 00:39:45.390
This is an 8k memory board.

00:39:45.390 --> 00:39:47.820
This probably cost about $8k.

00:39:47.820 --> 00:39:50.620
And it has 16
bitwords, so I guess

00:39:50.620 --> 00:39:52.920
you'd call it 16 kilobytes.

00:39:52.920 --> 00:39:56.030
And so it's got, I don't
know, about 100,000 cores.

00:39:56.030 --> 00:39:58.070
Individual cores--
these black squares

00:39:58.070 --> 00:39:59.880
are actually just a
mat of little itty

00:39:59.880 --> 00:40:03.110
bitty sticky magnetic cores
with three wires going

00:40:03.110 --> 00:40:05.550
through each one and an xy
wire and the readout thing,

00:40:05.550 --> 00:40:07.530
and this is for a
deck computer if you

00:40:07.530 --> 00:40:08.880
recognize that kind of thing.

00:40:08.880 --> 00:40:12.040
And these things cost lots
of money, and this is 8k.

00:40:12.040 --> 00:40:13.612
So the idea of a
megabyte, you know

00:40:13.612 --> 00:40:15.570
the reason those machines
had 16-bit addresses,

00:40:15.570 --> 00:40:18.180
nobody could afford more
than 16 bits worth of memory.

00:40:18.180 --> 00:40:20.230
64k-- my god, you'd
have to be rich.

00:40:20.230 --> 00:40:22.350
Do you remember these things?

00:40:22.350 --> 00:40:22.850
No.

00:40:22.850 --> 00:40:23.840
This is seven track.

00:40:23.840 --> 00:40:25.131
I bet you don't remember those.

00:40:25.131 --> 00:40:26.342
This is-- yeah.

00:40:26.342 --> 00:40:27.550
You can see the bits on this.

00:40:27.550 --> 00:40:29.133
You put it in
[INAUDIBLE] and you just

00:40:29.133 --> 00:40:31.495
look at it with a magnifying
glass and see the bits.

00:40:31.495 --> 00:40:32.470
How about this?

00:40:32.470 --> 00:40:35.210
[LAUGHTER]

00:40:35.210 --> 00:40:36.200
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:40:36.200 --> 00:40:39.381
Does anybody know the
capacity where it's like 100k?

00:40:39.381 --> 00:40:41.434
AUDIENCE: Yeah, it was
between 100 and 150k.

00:40:41.434 --> 00:40:42.850
PAUL HOROWITZ:
Yeah, this one says

00:40:42.850 --> 00:40:44.620
single-sided double density.

00:40:44.620 --> 00:40:47.360
This might be 200k.

00:40:47.360 --> 00:40:48.180
Eight inch floppy.

00:40:48.180 --> 00:40:51.030
You can see where the
word floppy came from.

00:40:51.030 --> 00:40:51.530
Floppy.

00:40:51.530 --> 00:40:52.350
OK, wait.

00:40:52.350 --> 00:40:54.850
I got a couple of
other toys in here.

00:40:54.850 --> 00:40:56.960
Wait, this one I
want to-- just a sec.

00:40:56.960 --> 00:40:57.590
Don't look.

00:40:57.590 --> 00:40:58.890
Don't look.

00:40:58.890 --> 00:41:01.670
I've got to give
you the quiz here.

00:41:01.670 --> 00:41:03.000
OK, there we go.

00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:05.218
Anybody recognize this?

00:41:05.218 --> 00:41:06.620
AUDIENCE: Oh yeah.

00:41:06.620 --> 00:41:09.297
It's for printing
out a punch card.

00:41:09.297 --> 00:41:11.130
PAUL HOROWITZ: Someone
told me the other day

00:41:11.130 --> 00:41:13.290
that there was
the analog of this

00:41:13.290 --> 00:41:14.980
that was for print punching.

00:41:14.980 --> 00:41:16.428
But this was for?

00:41:16.428 --> 00:41:18.980
AUDIENCE: Printing the pattern.

00:41:18.980 --> 00:41:20.830
PAUL HOROWITZ: OK, well, yeah.

00:41:20.830 --> 00:41:23.060
I guess you could-- that
was a thing you could do.

00:41:23.060 --> 00:41:28.749
This was a programming drum for
an IBM keypunch, the 026, 029.

00:41:28.749 --> 00:41:30.790
And what you did was you
showed this to somebody,

00:41:30.790 --> 00:41:31.380
and they'd say, oh, look.

00:41:31.380 --> 00:41:32.796
It's got a little
set of contacts,

00:41:32.796 --> 00:41:34.120
and it's got a cam here.

00:41:34.120 --> 00:41:36.850
So it's some sort of mechan--
electro blah, blah, blah.

00:41:36.850 --> 00:41:37.370
Nah.

00:41:37.370 --> 00:41:38.710
It's got these little
prongs so that you

00:41:38.710 --> 00:41:41.350
can stick this thing in and get
the ends in without sticking

00:41:41.350 --> 00:41:43.786
them, and you turn this
thing a half quadriturn,

00:41:43.786 --> 00:41:45.160
and then you go
around like that.

00:41:45.160 --> 00:41:46.590
Oops, I did it backwards.

00:41:46.590 --> 00:41:47.980
See?

00:41:47.980 --> 00:41:51.080
And this thing told it to
skip the first eight columns

00:41:51.080 --> 00:41:53.970
if you hit the Tab, because
that's where the-- you go

00:41:53.970 --> 00:41:55.590
to column eight, right?

00:41:55.590 --> 00:41:57.120
Unless you do a continuation.

00:41:57.120 --> 00:41:58.120
You remember this stuff?

00:41:58.120 --> 00:41:59.840
Remember Fortran?

00:41:59.840 --> 00:42:00.340
6?

00:42:00.340 --> 00:42:01.090
7?

00:42:01.090 --> 00:42:01.760
Yeah, OK.

00:42:01.760 --> 00:42:04.940
And then after '72 was
[INAUDIBLE], right?

00:42:04.940 --> 00:42:08.970
Yeah, this one says dupe
one to 50, 78 to 80,

00:42:08.970 --> 00:42:11.257
so this was for--
OK, what you say.

00:42:11.257 --> 00:42:12.340
Why isn't this staying in?

00:42:12.340 --> 00:42:14.920
I obviously don't know
how to use this anymore.

00:42:14.920 --> 00:42:16.190
I grew up in an 026.

00:42:16.190 --> 00:42:16.946
I should know.

00:42:19.692 --> 00:42:20.900
Anyway, I got one last thing.

00:42:20.900 --> 00:42:21.751
It's older.

00:42:21.751 --> 00:42:22.750
You won't know this one.

00:42:22.750 --> 00:42:23.708
Wait, I got two things.

00:42:23.708 --> 00:42:24.500
How about this?

00:42:27.070 --> 00:42:27.570
Yeah.

00:42:27.570 --> 00:42:29.690
What's this whole thing?

00:42:29.690 --> 00:42:30.870
It's an op amp.

00:42:30.870 --> 00:42:32.590
This is the first
kind of commercial op

00:42:32.590 --> 00:42:33.381
amp from Philbrick.

00:42:33.381 --> 00:42:35.260
I had a couple of 12AU7s.

00:42:35.260 --> 00:42:35.920
Cool thing.

00:42:35.920 --> 00:42:38.994
Four transistors, if you
want to think of it that way.

00:42:38.994 --> 00:42:40.910
Can you build an op amp
with four transistors?

00:42:40.910 --> 00:42:42.620
Those guys are smart.

00:42:42.620 --> 00:42:45.880
Here, how about this?

00:42:45.880 --> 00:42:47.290
See, it turns.

00:42:47.290 --> 00:42:50.334
It's got double cotton covered
copper wire on the inside,

00:42:50.334 --> 00:42:51.750
and if you look
carefully, there's

00:42:51.750 --> 00:42:54.850
a winding inside the outer one.

00:42:54.850 --> 00:43:00.870
Somebody with very steady
hands, and it's got a shaft,

00:43:00.870 --> 00:43:02.790
and it's got two terminals only.

00:43:02.790 --> 00:43:04.607
There they are.

00:43:04.607 --> 00:43:05.940
AUDIENCE: Oscillate [INAUDIBLE].

00:43:05.940 --> 00:43:06.640
PAUL HOROWITZ: Yes.

00:43:06.640 --> 00:43:08.040
You've got some old timers here.

00:43:08.040 --> 00:43:10.680
This thing appeared in
the Sears Roebuck catalog

00:43:10.680 --> 00:43:11.641
in the '20s and '30s.

00:43:11.641 --> 00:43:13.890
If you wanted to build a
radio, you wanted to tune it,

00:43:13.890 --> 00:43:15.590
you had to tune each RF stage.

00:43:15.590 --> 00:43:17.590
And they didn't like
variable capacitors.

00:43:17.590 --> 00:43:20.131
You had to get all those plates
to fit in between each other,

00:43:20.131 --> 00:43:23.600
and it didn't make coils,
Bakelite, great stuff.

00:43:23.600 --> 00:43:26.350
You guys pass as a group.

00:43:26.350 --> 00:43:29.570
Individual report cards
will come out later.

00:43:29.570 --> 00:43:30.070
Let's see.

00:43:30.070 --> 00:43:31.730
We've been on-- oh, let's see.

00:43:31.730 --> 00:43:32.769
What did we do?

00:43:32.769 --> 00:43:35.060
Let me just show you some
results from this META thing.

00:43:35.060 --> 00:43:36.530
We get a lot of
events like this.

00:43:36.530 --> 00:43:38.155
These are chirped in
the chirped frame.

00:43:38.155 --> 00:43:39.832
Therefore, they're not real.

00:43:39.832 --> 00:43:41.290
And here's three
examples of things

00:43:41.290 --> 00:43:42.940
that didn't do the right thing.

00:43:42.940 --> 00:43:45.687
But we came up with a few events
that we couldn't get rid of.

00:43:45.687 --> 00:43:47.770
The rejection wasn't
complete in this little paper

00:43:47.770 --> 00:43:48.769
I wrote with Carl Sagan.

00:43:48.769 --> 00:43:52.672
And you see here that we
found 37 candidate events that

00:43:52.672 --> 00:43:53.630
exceeded the threshold.

00:43:53.630 --> 00:43:55.520
Here's what they
look like on the sky.

00:43:55.520 --> 00:43:57.080
They're sort of
all over the place.

00:43:57.080 --> 00:44:00.340
Maybe a little bit of preference
for the galactic plane, but not

00:44:00.340 --> 00:44:01.567
much.

00:44:01.567 --> 00:44:03.400
I think the best thing
that came out of this

00:44:03.400 --> 00:44:06.250
is the food chain of SETI stuff.

00:44:06.250 --> 00:44:09.140
There's a company that decided
to name itself 37signals.

00:44:09.140 --> 00:44:14.687
Here's their logo, and they
got it from our search.

00:44:14.687 --> 00:44:15.770
I don't know what they do.

00:44:15.770 --> 00:44:17.220
It has nothing to do with SETI.

00:44:17.220 --> 00:44:19.009
Then we decided, eight
million channels.

00:44:19.009 --> 00:44:20.050
That's not nearly enough.

00:44:20.050 --> 00:44:21.734
We're not finding
anything interesting.

00:44:21.734 --> 00:44:22.650
We need more channels.

00:44:22.650 --> 00:44:25.840
So we built a thing
called beta, which

00:44:25.840 --> 00:44:28.940
is supposed to be billion
channel extraterrestrial assay.

00:44:28.940 --> 00:44:30.210
We got only 250 million.

00:44:30.210 --> 00:44:32.130
That was a lot of work
in those days, again.

00:44:32.130 --> 00:44:35.510
And the idea here was, let's
get rid of these single events

00:44:35.510 --> 00:44:37.010
that we can't pin down.

00:44:37.010 --> 00:44:39.960
We're going to have
a two-beam telescope,

00:44:39.960 --> 00:44:43.412
and because the telescope is
fixed, an east and a west beam,

00:44:43.412 --> 00:44:44.870
a source will
transit through them.

00:44:44.870 --> 00:44:47.078
So we should see it appear
first in the east and then

00:44:47.078 --> 00:44:49.150
in the west, and
just to make sure,

00:44:49.150 --> 00:44:51.300
to make it more robust
against local interference,

00:44:51.300 --> 00:44:56.090
we'll have a horizon sensitive
antenna at the top of a tower,

00:44:56.090 --> 00:44:58.780
and that'll be the veto
that's terrestrial.

00:44:58.780 --> 00:45:02.160
So we built this thing, and
here's our block diagram.

00:45:02.160 --> 00:45:05.200
You don't really care
about that, do you?

00:45:05.200 --> 00:45:06.340
Here's the control room.

00:45:06.340 --> 00:45:08.673
You can tell something's a
little fake, because I'm just

00:45:08.673 --> 00:45:11.860
looking at the green screen of
whatever we're running then.

00:45:11.860 --> 00:45:13.230
It must have been Unix.

00:45:13.230 --> 00:45:13.939
Linux?

00:45:13.939 --> 00:45:14.480
I don't know.

00:45:14.480 --> 00:45:15.814
Something.

00:45:15.814 --> 00:45:16.730
So here's our rackets.

00:45:16.730 --> 00:45:19.390
We're down to one rack now, and
we actually have lots of bytes.

00:45:19.390 --> 00:45:24.470
And here's a whole bunch of
90 megahertz Pentium PCs.

00:45:24.470 --> 00:45:26.590
That was state of
the art back then,

00:45:26.590 --> 00:45:29.980
and we cobbled these
things all together.

00:45:29.980 --> 00:45:31.829
And here's what one
rack looked like.

00:45:31.829 --> 00:45:34.120
So it's now the billion-channel
extraterrestrial assay.

00:45:34.120 --> 00:45:36.390
It no longer brags about
being a supercomputer.

00:45:36.390 --> 00:45:39.199
We learned our
lesson from that one.

00:45:39.199 --> 00:45:40.740
So that's what we
did, and this thing

00:45:40.740 --> 00:45:42.364
was able to search
the full water hole.

00:45:42.364 --> 00:45:47.800
That is that whole region from
hydrogen to hydroxyl radiation.

00:45:47.800 --> 00:45:51.110
And the best we got out of this
was a few occasional things

00:45:51.110 --> 00:45:53.360
that never repeated, and we
got sort of tired of this,

00:45:53.360 --> 00:45:54.520
so we said, let's do optical.

00:45:54.520 --> 00:45:55.030
Whoops.

00:45:55.030 --> 00:45:55.530
Oh, yeah.

00:45:55.530 --> 00:45:58.436
We were sort of proud of how
fast this thing produces data.

00:45:58.436 --> 00:45:59.810
Two seconds of
data would fill up

00:45:59.810 --> 00:46:04.854
a CD, which was state of the art
optical storage in those days.

00:46:04.854 --> 00:46:06.770
And it's also the world's
biggest garbage can,

00:46:06.770 --> 00:46:08.990
because we threw this all out,
except for the occasional stuff

00:46:08.990 --> 00:46:09.842
that we didn't.

00:46:09.842 --> 00:46:11.330
So that was cool.

00:46:11.330 --> 00:46:12.030
That was cool.

00:46:12.030 --> 00:46:13.680
I'll show you something
that's an even bigger garbage

00:46:13.680 --> 00:46:14.532
can coming up.

00:46:14.532 --> 00:46:16.490
So we decided to get into
the optical business,

00:46:16.490 --> 00:46:19.620
and you'll remember that
calculation, optical works.

00:46:19.620 --> 00:46:21.040
And we had this
ancient telescope.

00:46:21.040 --> 00:46:21.831
Look at this thing.

00:46:21.831 --> 00:46:22.830
Is that cool?

00:46:22.830 --> 00:46:23.920
Isn't that-- look at this.

00:46:23.920 --> 00:46:26.266
They don't build them
like that anymore.

00:46:26.266 --> 00:46:28.140
And what we did was we
tacked this little box

00:46:28.140 --> 00:46:29.890
that you see here onto
the bottom of this thing

00:46:29.890 --> 00:46:32.170
and took half of the light
out that other people were

00:46:32.170 --> 00:46:33.630
using for their experiments.

00:46:33.630 --> 00:46:36.980
And they were looking at solar
type stars for various reasons,

00:46:36.980 --> 00:46:39.730
and so we just decided we'd
take some of the signal

00:46:39.730 --> 00:46:42.690
and look for bright flashes.

00:46:42.690 --> 00:46:44.570
Here's a picture of the
little box we built.

00:46:44.570 --> 00:46:46.789
It's made out of half-inch
thick aluminum walls,

00:46:46.789 --> 00:46:48.330
because we decided
that's the easiest

00:46:48.330 --> 00:46:50.850
way to tap directly into it.

00:46:50.850 --> 00:46:53.161
And it weighed about 100 pounds.

00:46:53.161 --> 00:46:55.410
There's probably a better
way to screw things together

00:46:55.410 --> 00:46:57.534
that you don't have to make
them a half inch thick,

00:46:57.534 --> 00:47:00.070
but we were kind of-- all right.

00:47:00.070 --> 00:47:01.542
Here's a schematic.

00:47:01.542 --> 00:47:03.500
You know we do do
electronics in this business.

00:47:03.500 --> 00:47:05.570
This is sort of the
front end of this thing.

00:47:05.570 --> 00:47:07.650
We used what are called
hybrid avalanche photo

00:47:07.650 --> 00:47:11.180
detectors and a whole bunch
of other crazy stuff here.

00:47:11.180 --> 00:47:13.450
And we decided in order
to make this more robust

00:47:13.450 --> 00:47:15.420
and set up a collaboration
with Princeton,

00:47:15.420 --> 00:47:17.600
so here's our telescope,
and at Princeton, they

00:47:17.600 --> 00:47:19.900
had a 36-inch
telescope on campus.

00:47:19.900 --> 00:47:21.510
And Dave Wilkinson
basically arranged

00:47:21.510 --> 00:47:25.890
for them to build an
identical copy of our system

00:47:25.890 --> 00:47:27.770
on a somewhat smaller
telescope and to do

00:47:27.770 --> 00:47:29.380
simultaneous observations.

00:47:29.380 --> 00:47:32.100
And the nice thing
about that is that when

00:47:32.100 --> 00:47:34.160
you do simultaneous
observations,

00:47:34.160 --> 00:47:38.660
you're rather insensitive to any
local events that could produce

00:47:38.660 --> 00:47:40.580
a flashing light
at 250 miles apart,

00:47:40.580 --> 00:47:42.600
300 miles apart it says here.

00:47:42.600 --> 00:47:44.720
And better than that,
because that's about

00:47:44.720 --> 00:47:47.186
1.6 light milliseconds apart.

00:47:47.186 --> 00:47:49.060
If you're pointing some
direction in the sky,

00:47:49.060 --> 00:47:50.890
you should get your flash of
light at a different time.

00:47:50.890 --> 00:47:52.760
You know exactly when
you should get it,

00:47:52.760 --> 00:47:55.770
and we did timing with
GPS, so we could actually

00:47:55.770 --> 00:47:57.634
check to see not
only if anything ever

00:47:57.634 --> 00:47:59.550
happened at the same
time, but whether it even

00:47:59.550 --> 00:48:00.840
had the correct delay.

00:48:00.840 --> 00:48:02.630
And the result of
this was that we got

00:48:02.630 --> 00:48:04.726
basically no further events.

00:48:04.726 --> 00:48:06.350
Here's some pictures
of their telescope

00:48:06.350 --> 00:48:07.990
getting this stuff on it.

00:48:07.990 --> 00:48:10.867
We had something like a
few hundred single events

00:48:10.867 --> 00:48:12.700
before we started teaming
up with Princeton,

00:48:12.700 --> 00:48:16.810
but once we did, it drove
the event rate to zero.

00:48:16.810 --> 00:48:18.510
So here's some results.

00:48:18.510 --> 00:48:19.807
What about all this?

00:48:19.807 --> 00:48:21.890
If you don't find anything,
does it mean anything?

00:48:21.890 --> 00:48:24.431
Well, it means that the sky is
not completely full of people,

00:48:24.431 --> 00:48:29.350
of flashy things, men
in black, flashy things.

00:48:29.350 --> 00:48:31.440
But the limits are kind of weak.

00:48:31.440 --> 00:48:33.300
You can set limits of
the fraction of stars

00:48:33.300 --> 00:48:35.299
that have transmitting
civilizations that happen

00:48:35.299 --> 00:48:38.030
to be transmitting at us with
a nice bright thing at the time

00:48:38.030 --> 00:48:38.670
we're looking.

00:48:38.670 --> 00:48:40.253
So that's the kind
of numbers you get.

00:48:40.253 --> 00:48:42.500
I'll show you a
better slide on this

00:48:42.500 --> 00:48:44.360
when we got to a bigger
experiment, which

00:48:44.360 --> 00:48:47.090
is the next one, which is
we decided we need not just

00:48:47.090 --> 00:48:49.405
look at star by star,
but the whole sky.

00:48:49.405 --> 00:48:50.780
And this came out
of a challenge.

00:48:50.780 --> 00:48:52.440
I was on a committee
thinking about how

00:48:52.440 --> 00:48:53.890
to do SETI for
the next 20 years,

00:48:53.890 --> 00:48:56.060
and there was an optical
astronomer there,

00:48:56.060 --> 00:48:58.960
a rather famous one, who
said, of course, optical--

00:48:58.960 --> 00:49:01.777
you can't do all sky, because
you're using telescopes,

00:49:01.777 --> 00:49:03.110
and they only look at one thing.

00:49:03.110 --> 00:49:04.901
I thought that was a
really cool challenge,

00:49:04.901 --> 00:49:08.050
so I came back and said, let's
build an all sky optical SETI.

00:49:08.050 --> 00:49:09.390
So here's how you do it.

00:49:09.390 --> 00:49:11.723
You get one of these things,
and you start knocking down

00:49:11.723 --> 00:49:13.910
trees and building
and dig ditches,

00:49:13.910 --> 00:49:16.410
and you find that there's wires
in there, and then it snows.

00:49:16.410 --> 00:49:18.946
And you pour a foundation,
and then the foundation,

00:49:18.946 --> 00:49:20.070
you get this kind of thing.

00:49:20.070 --> 00:49:21.820
This is where the
telescope's going to go.

00:49:21.820 --> 00:49:23.256
And then you start
putting a roof.

00:49:23.256 --> 00:49:24.630
You make this
thing out of steel,

00:49:24.630 --> 00:49:26.419
and you put a roof on
it, and there it is.

00:49:26.419 --> 00:49:26.960
Look at that.

00:49:26.960 --> 00:49:28.709
It's got a roof, and
it goes on the rails.

00:49:28.709 --> 00:49:30.080
It's a rolloff observatory.

00:49:30.080 --> 00:49:31.380
Here comes the telescope.

00:49:31.380 --> 00:49:33.960
It was made in
Arkansas by some guys

00:49:33.960 --> 00:49:35.270
who didn't need much money.

00:49:35.270 --> 00:49:40.460
They gave us a 72-inch,
six foot optical primary,

00:49:40.460 --> 00:49:44.210
a three-foot secondary, the
mount, and the drive system

00:49:44.210 --> 00:49:45.560
and everything for $50,000.

00:49:45.560 --> 00:49:47.590
A real bargain, so
we got this thing.

00:49:47.590 --> 00:49:49.130
And here it is
with our telescope.

00:49:49.130 --> 00:49:50.160
The roof rolled off.

00:49:50.160 --> 00:49:51.660
Here's a couple of
graduate students

00:49:51.660 --> 00:49:53.285
who were working on
this, and there you

00:49:53.285 --> 00:49:55.420
can see this telescope
pointing up into the sky.

00:49:55.420 --> 00:49:56.510
This is at Harvard.

00:49:56.510 --> 00:49:57.843
And this thing is still working.

00:49:57.843 --> 00:49:58.920
Working now.

00:49:58.920 --> 00:50:00.855
I ran it just the other night.

00:50:00.855 --> 00:50:01.730
Here's some pictures.

00:50:01.730 --> 00:50:04.300
This is what it looks
like from the inside.

00:50:04.300 --> 00:50:05.530
Here's the control room.

00:50:05.530 --> 00:50:07.196
This time, we're
actually running Linux.

00:50:07.196 --> 00:50:09.870
This is for real.

00:50:09.870 --> 00:50:12.850
And Andrew, the student
in that picture,

00:50:12.850 --> 00:50:16.081
designed a chip to do optical
coincidence and amplification

00:50:16.081 --> 00:50:18.080
and all that, and here's
a bunch of these boards

00:50:18.080 --> 00:50:21.324
with these chips and a whole
pile of fans inside this box

00:50:21.324 --> 00:50:22.490
that hangs on the telescope.

00:50:22.490 --> 00:50:23.948
Here's some fat
wire, because we're

00:50:23.948 --> 00:50:27.167
running about 80 amps and
3 volts to this thing.

00:50:27.167 --> 00:50:29.000
Here's the motherboard
and the daughterboard

00:50:29.000 --> 00:50:30.445
and a detector and a pencil.

00:50:33.370 --> 00:50:36.990
People don't use these anymore,
except hey, isn't there a thing

00:50:36.990 --> 00:50:38.730
called Apple Pencil?

00:50:38.730 --> 00:50:39.480
What's that thing?

00:50:39.480 --> 00:50:41.660
Remember, if a stylus
shows that you failed,

00:50:41.660 --> 00:50:44.897
but then there is one, but
it's not called a stylus?

00:50:44.897 --> 00:50:45.730
You know about that?

00:50:45.730 --> 00:50:46.260
No?

00:50:46.260 --> 00:50:46.550
Yeah.

00:50:46.550 --> 00:50:46.870
OK.

00:50:46.870 --> 00:50:47.350
Whatever.

00:50:47.350 --> 00:50:47.840
Anyway, here.

00:50:47.840 --> 00:50:48.790
This is a real pencil.

00:50:48.790 --> 00:50:51.700
This is-- OK.

00:50:51.700 --> 00:50:52.520
Oh, yeah.

00:50:52.520 --> 00:50:54.709
So I stole this slide from
my student, and you see.

00:50:54.709 --> 00:50:55.250
Look at that.

00:50:55.250 --> 00:50:57.340
I don't know how to do that.

00:50:57.340 --> 00:50:58.600
Anyway, here's his chip.

00:50:58.600 --> 00:51:00.950
Chip took him four years
to get it to work right,

00:51:00.950 --> 00:51:02.000
and it was a lot of work.

00:51:02.000 --> 00:51:03.450
And this thing
basically lets you

00:51:03.450 --> 00:51:07.580
look at about a giga sample
per second of data coming

00:51:07.580 --> 00:51:09.360
in on a big panel of stuff.

00:51:09.360 --> 00:51:12.550
Here's us building these things
and bringing out the door

00:51:12.550 --> 00:51:15.010
and over to the
telescope, and here we

00:51:15.010 --> 00:51:18.830
are inaugurating
the observatory.

00:51:18.830 --> 00:51:19.900
And here's first night.

00:51:19.900 --> 00:51:21.310
First light, first night.

00:51:21.310 --> 00:51:25.900
So this guy went from
senior at Harvard to Google.

00:51:25.900 --> 00:51:28.320
You guys swallowed him whole.

00:51:28.320 --> 00:51:30.872
This guy went to Apple.

00:51:30.872 --> 00:51:32.080
And this guy went to Harvard.

00:51:32.080 --> 00:51:33.790
This guy by way of the
South Pole for a year

00:51:33.790 --> 00:51:34.956
went to Harvey Mudd College.

00:51:34.956 --> 00:51:38.046
So there's life after SETI,
although it may not be SETI.

00:51:38.046 --> 00:51:40.420
And here we are basically
getting all this stuff working.

00:51:40.420 --> 00:51:42.262
It's a really nice interface.

00:51:42.262 --> 00:51:43.970
You have these little
things you click on

00:51:43.970 --> 00:51:45.059
and a whole panel opens.

00:51:45.059 --> 00:51:46.850
It shows you what the
observatory is doing,

00:51:46.850 --> 00:51:49.510
it shows you what the power
is doing, has a few web cams,

00:51:49.510 --> 00:51:54.575
and it shows you pulsed-like
optical events down here.

00:51:54.575 --> 00:51:55.950
Let's see, what's
coming up here?

00:51:55.950 --> 00:51:58.920
Oh, it says "Show
time-lapse skycam movie."

00:51:58.920 --> 00:52:00.540
All right.

00:52:00.540 --> 00:52:02.030
So this is what
the sky looks like,

00:52:02.030 --> 00:52:05.100
just out in the countryside
here at Harvard.

00:52:05.100 --> 00:52:06.590
You don't see this
from Cambridge.

00:52:06.590 --> 00:52:09.061
People who live in cities don't
know that there are stars.

00:52:09.061 --> 00:52:11.560
And those little flashes, those
are airplanes going through.

00:52:11.560 --> 00:52:14.360
These are 10-second exposures,
taken every few minutes.

00:52:14.360 --> 00:52:16.100
So you just get little
flashes of that.

00:52:16.100 --> 00:52:17.850
Probably an occasional
satellite in there.

00:52:17.850 --> 00:52:20.030
You may recognize
a constellation,

00:52:20.030 --> 00:52:22.470
and then you'll recognize
moonrise, because it completely

00:52:22.470 --> 00:52:23.590
clobbers the sky here.

00:52:23.590 --> 00:52:26.200
I think that's what's happening
there-- something very bright.

00:52:26.200 --> 00:52:28.200
That's not the moon,
that's light reflecting off

00:52:28.200 --> 00:52:30.740
the tree that's over here.

00:52:30.740 --> 00:52:36.970
Anyway, here comes
the moment-- OK, wham.

00:52:36.970 --> 00:52:38.650
Wow, OK, and now I
think in one here,

00:52:38.650 --> 00:52:40.525
you see the roof open
in one of these things.

00:52:40.525 --> 00:52:43.115
Let's see, look at
that-- that was a roof.

00:52:43.115 --> 00:52:45.490
Whoa, look at that, OK, anyway,
that's kind of cool, huh?

00:52:45.490 --> 00:52:46.740
All right, whoa, there
are some clouds--

00:52:46.740 --> 00:52:48.010
we get that, too, here.

00:52:48.010 --> 00:52:49.780
Look at that-- is that great?

00:52:49.780 --> 00:52:51.220
Show you the kind of events
we see with this thing.

00:52:51.220 --> 00:52:52.910
So we're looking for
short pulses of the kind

00:52:52.910 --> 00:52:54.410
that the calculations
show that you

00:52:54.410 --> 00:52:56.290
can project across
these distances,

00:52:56.290 --> 00:52:57.249
and outshine your star.

00:52:57.249 --> 00:52:59.289
And here's the kind of
thing we occasionally get,

00:52:59.289 --> 00:53:00.500
this is an interesting event.

00:53:00.500 --> 00:53:02.990
And here's what it looks
like on these detectors.

00:53:02.990 --> 00:53:04.845
I didn't describe this,
and I won't really,

00:53:04.845 --> 00:53:07.220
except to say that we have
these detectors that are eight

00:53:07.220 --> 00:53:10.550
by eight arrays of
photomultiplier tube, photo

00:53:10.550 --> 00:53:11.400
cathodes.

00:53:11.400 --> 00:53:13.210
And they're arrayed
with a beam splitter,

00:53:13.210 --> 00:53:15.260
so they form a coincident pair.

00:53:15.260 --> 00:53:16.710
And we insist on
the coincidence--

00:53:16.710 --> 00:53:18.697
that as something
hits the right panel,

00:53:18.697 --> 00:53:21.030
has to hit in the corresponding
place on the left panel.

00:53:21.030 --> 00:53:24.910
And here's such an event
that occurred back in 2007,

00:53:24.910 --> 00:53:27.300
and tickled these two detectors.

00:53:27.300 --> 00:53:30.960
And the red and blue
tracers here show the right

00:53:30.960 --> 00:53:34.186
and left signals coming
out of these detectors.

00:53:34.186 --> 00:53:36.560
So this is the kind of thing
that we've been looking for.

00:53:36.560 --> 00:53:38.850
And here's the
kind of sensitivity

00:53:38.850 --> 00:53:41.340
it sets for fraction of
stars with transmitting

00:53:41.340 --> 00:53:42.100
civilizations.

00:53:42.100 --> 00:53:44.100
And you can see, it's
really quite a bit better

00:53:44.100 --> 00:53:46.740
than-- oh, here's one we
covered more of the skky--

00:53:46.740 --> 00:53:49.590
than when we had the targeted
search that I showed you

00:53:49.590 --> 00:53:51.472
earlier, with that
ancient-looking telescope.

00:53:51.472 --> 00:53:53.680
And the reason is we're just
covering a lot more sky.

00:53:53.680 --> 00:53:55.480
We're covering it for less time.

00:53:55.480 --> 00:53:59.415
So it's less sensitive
to transmitters

00:53:59.415 --> 00:54:01.290
that don't repeat very
often, because we only

00:54:01.290 --> 00:54:03.991
spend about one minute on
any given place in the sky.

00:54:03.991 --> 00:54:05.490
And here's some
sort of a little bit

00:54:05.490 --> 00:54:07.880
of interpretation about
the context in which that

00:54:07.880 --> 00:54:08.780
makes sense.

00:54:08.780 --> 00:54:10.140
Now I'm going to accelerate
a little bit here,

00:54:10.140 --> 00:54:11.890
because there's some
cool stuff coming up.

00:54:11.890 --> 00:54:14.100
The last thing we did
with this experiment

00:54:14.100 --> 00:54:19.900
is this student, Curtis,
who wound up now at Amazon--

00:54:19.900 --> 00:54:22.430
I'm sorry, he wound up at Apple.

00:54:22.430 --> 00:54:23.530
Those "A" companies.

00:54:23.530 --> 00:54:25.930
And this is the thing
he built-- he came up

00:54:25.930 --> 00:54:28.050
with a really clever
idea, which is this--

00:54:28.050 --> 00:54:31.525
if you take a fancy FPGA,
one of these Xilinx parts,

00:54:31.525 --> 00:54:33.150
they have a whole
bunch of inputs which

00:54:33.150 --> 00:54:34.733
are meant for digital
signals, they're

00:54:34.733 --> 00:54:36.594
LVDS differential pairs.

00:54:36.594 --> 00:54:38.010
But they're very
good comparitors,

00:54:38.010 --> 00:54:41.535
so you can trick it
into being a flash

00:54:41.535 --> 00:54:43.660
analog to digital converter,
even though it doesn't

00:54:43.660 --> 00:54:44.910
know that's what you're doing.

00:54:44.910 --> 00:54:47.770
So you tie eight of these
with a common signal,

00:54:47.770 --> 00:54:50.240
and put in a
progression of biases,

00:54:50.240 --> 00:54:51.680
and you've got yourself an ADC.

00:54:51.680 --> 00:54:53.930
And you can run these things
at 1 and 1/2 giga samples

00:54:53.930 --> 00:54:54.610
per second.

00:54:54.610 --> 00:54:57.580
And you can put 32 of
these into one chip--

00:54:57.580 --> 00:55:00.920
so he's got two pairs for the
left and right matching pixels,

00:55:00.920 --> 00:55:03.890
and then he's got 16 of those
things in one of these chips.

00:55:03.890 --> 00:55:05.390
And it's got all
kinds of other junk

00:55:05.390 --> 00:55:07.474
in here-- you know, these
chips are full of stuff.

00:55:07.474 --> 00:55:09.265
And in fact, here's
this whole little thing

00:55:09.265 --> 00:55:10.320
with this front end.

00:55:10.320 --> 00:55:13.050
It's also got-- heck you can
drop a MicroBlaze into there,

00:55:13.050 --> 00:55:14.930
and you've got an ethernet
MAC in this thing.

00:55:14.930 --> 00:55:16.860
And you name it, it's got it.

00:55:16.860 --> 00:55:22.685
So each one of these things
is a node on our network.

00:55:22.685 --> 00:55:24.060
And he put these
things together.

00:55:24.060 --> 00:55:25.435
And the damn thing
works-- here's

00:55:25.435 --> 00:55:27.670
an example of a double pulse
feeding into this thing.

00:55:27.670 --> 00:55:30.600
Notice we use nonlinear
levels, because you

00:55:30.600 --> 00:55:32.930
can do that if you set
your own drip points.

00:55:32.930 --> 00:55:35.660
And the jiggly red
line is ground truth,

00:55:35.660 --> 00:55:37.760
with a gigahertz scope.

00:55:37.760 --> 00:55:42.930
And the black line is what this
crazy kluged up ADC measures

00:55:42.930 --> 00:55:43.780
for a double pulse.

00:55:43.780 --> 00:55:44.660
So it works great.

00:55:44.660 --> 00:55:45.451
Thing really works.

00:55:45.451 --> 00:55:48.010
So we've had this thing looking
at the sky, and we see events

00:55:48.010 --> 00:55:48.590
like this.

00:55:48.590 --> 00:55:50.006
This is a cool
event, because look

00:55:50.006 --> 00:55:52.140
at this-- it's matching
left and right,

00:55:52.140 --> 00:55:54.645
and it's a short pulse,
even when expanded here.

00:55:57.240 --> 00:55:59.316
Here's something
that-- something

00:55:59.316 --> 00:56:01.690
a little fishy about it, hid
an awful lot of pixels here.

00:56:01.690 --> 00:56:03.460
And look how long the
thing took to spread

00:56:03.460 --> 00:56:06.350
like that-- it's really
greatly expanded in time.

00:56:06.350 --> 00:56:08.180
It's actually taking
a significant fraction

00:56:08.180 --> 00:56:09.450
of a microsecond.

00:56:09.450 --> 00:56:11.120
Guess what that is?

00:56:11.120 --> 00:56:11.860
It's an airplane.

00:56:11.860 --> 00:56:13.820
Because our skycam
caught it in the act.

00:56:13.820 --> 00:56:16.150
Here it is, flying
toward our thing,

00:56:16.150 --> 00:56:19.480
and then it went through, and
we saw this gigantic thing.

00:56:19.480 --> 00:56:21.920
So we see some of
those things from time.

00:56:21.920 --> 00:56:23.835
Now it says, "show--" OK.

00:56:28.140 --> 00:56:30.260
Here's another kind of event.

00:56:30.260 --> 00:56:33.090
This is a cosmic ray, which
hits a whole bunch of pixels

00:56:33.090 --> 00:56:35.040
like that, but also
is short-pulse,

00:56:35.040 --> 00:56:36.676
and we're sensitive
to these things.

00:56:36.676 --> 00:56:38.550
I'm going to skip the
movie and just show you

00:56:38.550 --> 00:56:41.000
this is the amount of the
sky that we've covered now.

00:56:41.000 --> 00:56:43.247
If it's brighter
red, like that, it

00:56:43.247 --> 00:56:44.830
means we've covered
it multiple times.

00:56:44.830 --> 00:56:47.540
So we've covered basically
the whole sky multiple times

00:56:47.540 --> 00:56:49.830
with this search.

00:56:49.830 --> 00:56:51.840
Here's an example
of another event.

00:56:51.840 --> 00:56:54.320
Here is, again, the sky, and
here's these little pulses.

00:56:54.320 --> 00:56:56.810
And we see these things
from time to time.

00:56:56.810 --> 00:56:57.910
They've never repeated.

00:56:57.910 --> 00:57:00.610
The telescope automatically
goes back to that declination,

00:57:00.610 --> 00:57:02.680
and tries to do it
again the next night.

00:57:02.680 --> 00:57:05.470
So this is some
of our non-events.

00:57:05.470 --> 00:57:07.330
Now, here's an example
of a real event.

00:57:07.330 --> 00:57:11.987
We have another camera at
the observatory that looks

00:57:11.987 --> 00:57:13.070
from the Central building.

00:57:13.070 --> 00:57:14.570
And we get these
kind of creatures--

00:57:14.570 --> 00:57:17.240
not exactly extraterrestrial,
some degree of intelligence,

00:57:17.240 --> 00:57:17.740
though.

00:57:17.740 --> 00:57:20.600
What we did is we decided in
order to eliminate isolated

00:57:20.600 --> 00:57:22.150
events, we need two sites.

00:57:22.150 --> 00:57:26.770
So here's Curtis at the Mount
Hopkins Observatory in Arizona,

00:57:26.770 --> 00:57:29.020
with this big telescope
used for cosmic rays.

00:57:29.020 --> 00:57:30.560
Cosmic rays generate
light flashes

00:57:30.560 --> 00:57:32.143
when they come through
the atmosphere.

00:57:32.143 --> 00:57:35.270
And what he did-- there is what
its detector looks like-- he

00:57:35.270 --> 00:57:37.330
rigged it up so we were
running both experiments,

00:57:37.330 --> 00:57:38.430
since ours runs remotely.

00:57:38.430 --> 00:57:41.870
Here's the Massachusetts, our
observatory, here's Arizona,

00:57:41.870 --> 00:57:44.670
and here's Curtis looking
for simultaneous events.

00:57:44.670 --> 00:57:47.355
And that drives the data rate
all the way down to zero.

00:57:47.355 --> 00:57:49.480
Well, here's where we are
now with this experiment.

00:57:49.480 --> 00:57:51.760
This is actually just
a few nights ago,

00:57:51.760 --> 00:57:55.210
this is January
6th, and we're still

00:57:55.210 --> 00:57:57.300
running this thing
on every clear night.

00:57:57.300 --> 00:58:00.650
People always want to know what
you found, it's sort of sad.

00:58:00.650 --> 00:58:01.920
We find occasional events.

00:58:01.920 --> 00:58:05.175
This is Wow Signal from
Ohio State in the '60s.

00:58:05.175 --> 00:58:07.300
Here's this kind of thing,
with a notifier operator

00:58:07.300 --> 00:58:09.790
immediately, occasional events.

00:58:09.790 --> 00:58:13.510
Here's the optical SETI, and
we get these occasional events.

00:58:13.510 --> 00:58:17.140
What we need, really,
is more observatories,

00:58:17.140 --> 00:58:19.189
greater sensitivity,
immediate follow-up.

00:58:19.189 --> 00:58:21.730
So let me just tell you in the
last one minute and 50 seconds

00:58:21.730 --> 00:58:22.570
what's happening.

00:58:22.570 --> 00:58:24.489
There is this new
initiative called

00:58:24.489 --> 00:58:26.030
the Breakthrough
Listen-- it's funded

00:58:26.030 --> 00:58:27.540
by a Russian billionaire.

00:58:27.540 --> 00:58:28.830
He pledged $100 million.

00:58:28.830 --> 00:58:30.850
And what they've done
is bought telescope time

00:58:30.850 --> 00:58:33.840
for at least the first few
years, on three of the best

00:58:33.840 --> 00:58:34.340
telescopes.

00:58:34.340 --> 00:58:35.714
This is the Green
Bank steerable,

00:58:35.714 --> 00:58:38.704
100-meter dish, biggest dish
in the world, steerable dish.

00:58:38.704 --> 00:58:40.120
Very good system
temperature, it's

00:58:40.120 --> 00:58:42.000
got an offset Gregorian feed.

00:58:42.000 --> 00:58:43.800
It's a really classy
piece of stuff.

00:58:43.800 --> 00:58:46.800
This is the Parkes telescope
in Australia, which

00:58:46.800 --> 00:58:48.270
gets you the southern sky.

00:58:48.270 --> 00:58:50.010
And this is the
Automated Planet Finder

00:58:50.010 --> 00:58:53.360
at Lick, which has a very high
resolution spectrometer used

00:58:53.360 --> 00:58:56.850
for planet finding, but it's
also a terrific telescope

00:58:56.850 --> 00:58:59.250
if you want to look
for little laser lines

00:58:59.250 --> 00:59:02.640
in the middle of the thicket
of lines that come from a star.

00:59:02.640 --> 00:59:05.375
So these have all been
pressed into service.

00:59:08.940 --> 00:59:10.930
Here's some of the
technology-- let's see,

00:59:10.930 --> 00:59:13.190
I want to get to the target--
here's the technology.

00:59:13.190 --> 00:59:15.481
The guys at Berkeley who have
designed some really fast

00:59:15.481 --> 00:59:18.170
stuff, have these
FPGA-based boards

00:59:18.170 --> 00:59:21.850
that can do a
26-gigasample sampling,

00:59:21.850 --> 00:59:26.630
they generate 320 gigabits
per second of data.

00:59:26.630 --> 00:59:29.950
They're doing 10
giga-channel spectroscopy

00:59:29.950 --> 00:59:31.960
on a 10-gigahertz bandwidth.

00:59:31.960 --> 00:59:34.590
Really, incredibly nice stuff.

00:59:34.590 --> 00:59:38.484
And here's the stuff they're
going to look at, some targets.

00:59:38.484 --> 00:59:39.400
Produce a lot of data.

00:59:39.400 --> 00:59:42.060
Look where it winds
up-- in your cloud.

00:59:42.060 --> 00:59:43.510
You are here.

00:59:43.510 --> 00:59:45.070
Here's one of
their boards that's

00:59:45.070 --> 00:59:48.916
a 26-gigasample
per second thing.

00:59:48.916 --> 00:59:50.540
And here's one of
their block diagrams.

00:59:50.540 --> 00:59:51.915
These guys are
very good at this,

00:59:51.915 --> 00:59:53.590
and this Casper
project has built

00:59:53.590 --> 00:59:55.560
beautiful, FPGA-based
hardware that's

00:59:55.560 --> 00:59:58.290
used for all kinds of things,
not just astronomy-- radio

00:59:58.290 --> 01:00:00.730
astronomy-- it's used for
protein folding stuff,

01:00:00.730 --> 01:00:03.800
and MRI, and all
that kind of stuff.

01:00:03.800 --> 01:00:05.350
Future-- couple things going up.

01:00:05.350 --> 01:00:08.275
There's some arrays going up--
four seconds, three seconds.

01:00:08.275 --> 01:00:10.650
This is in China, this is
going to be the world's biggest

01:00:10.650 --> 01:00:12.970
telescope-- 500 meters.

01:00:12.970 --> 01:00:14.270
I think it's now finished.

01:00:14.270 --> 01:00:16.740
Here's an array
that's coming up.

01:00:16.740 --> 01:00:20.590
And here's a piece of the SKA--
the square-kilometer array

01:00:20.590 --> 01:00:21.290
in South Africa.

01:00:21.290 --> 01:00:23.870
It's called MeerKAT-- which
is an acronym for something,

01:00:23.870 --> 01:00:25.620
but that's also that
funny looking animal.

01:00:25.620 --> 01:00:28.300
Kind of looks like this, if
you've seen those things.

01:00:28.300 --> 01:00:29.510
Interesting question--
what do you do with arrays?

01:00:29.510 --> 01:00:30.870
Arrays are very
good because they

01:00:30.870 --> 01:00:33.036
discriminate against things
in different directions.

01:00:33.036 --> 01:00:35.830
They also can produce multiple
beams at the same time,

01:00:35.830 --> 01:00:36.830
with full sensitivity.

01:00:36.830 --> 01:00:38.950
So they're nice things.

01:00:38.950 --> 01:00:41.460
This is actually my last
slide-- zero seconds.

01:00:41.460 --> 01:00:43.960
Let me just show you-- this as
an interesting thing in which

01:00:43.960 --> 01:00:45.418
you can put a bunch
of antennas up,

01:00:45.418 --> 01:00:47.140
do you make them big or small?

01:00:47.140 --> 01:00:48.840
If you make them small, and
you want a lot of aperture,

01:00:48.840 --> 01:00:49.756
you need more of them.

01:00:49.756 --> 01:00:50.999
So you spend more.

01:00:50.999 --> 01:00:53.290
The smaller dish is cheaper,
but you need more of them,

01:00:53.290 --> 01:00:54.873
and you have to
connect them together.

01:00:54.873 --> 01:00:59.460
This is sort of showing you
the partitioning of costs

01:00:59.460 --> 01:01:03.720
in euros of telescopes as a
function of dish diameter.

01:01:03.720 --> 01:01:06.099
So a few big ones, a
lot of little ones.

01:01:06.099 --> 01:01:08.390
Building a lot of little ones
is cheaper on the dishes,

01:01:08.390 --> 01:01:10.170
but you got to need
more wiring, and you

01:01:10.170 --> 01:01:12.170
need a lot more
electronics in the car

01:01:12.170 --> 01:01:14.970
later, and in computing.

01:01:14.970 --> 01:01:17.080
This figure of merit
here is a figure of merit

01:01:17.080 --> 01:01:21.330
that has to do with
degrees of sky covered,

01:01:21.330 --> 01:01:25.230
times collecting area,
divided by system temperature.

01:01:25.230 --> 01:01:27.830
It's sort of the right figure
of merit for this kind of thing.

01:01:27.830 --> 01:01:29.600
And what you see is you actually
get a much better figure

01:01:29.600 --> 01:01:31.160
of merit with small dishes.

01:01:31.160 --> 01:01:35.020
And the reason is that each
dish, because it's small,

01:01:35.020 --> 01:01:36.346
covers a lot of the sky.

01:01:36.346 --> 01:01:37.720
And anywhere within
that sky, you

01:01:37.720 --> 01:01:39.950
can form beams using
all of the dishes.

01:01:39.950 --> 01:01:41.960
So you cover a large
piece of the sky,

01:01:41.960 --> 01:01:46.280
with as many as N or N
squared beams, simultaneously

01:01:46.280 --> 01:01:47.562
with a lot of small dishes.

01:01:47.562 --> 01:01:49.270
Whereas with the big
dishes, you can only

01:01:49.270 --> 01:01:50.930
look at a small
piece of the sky.

01:01:50.930 --> 01:01:52.350
So it actually pays to do that.

01:01:52.350 --> 01:01:54.420
Right now it costs
kind of a lot.

01:01:54.420 --> 01:01:55.920
On the other hand,
this is the stuff

01:01:55.920 --> 01:01:59.460
that gets cheaper-- the
computing and the correlating.

01:01:59.460 --> 01:02:01.250
And so really what
you should do is

01:02:01.250 --> 01:02:03.620
you should bias towards the
left side of this bar graph,

01:02:03.620 --> 01:02:04.810
and build a lot of small dishes.

01:02:04.810 --> 01:02:06.643
And that's where people
are going with this.

01:02:06.643 --> 01:02:08.520
Anyway, I would say,
in spite of all these

01:02:08.520 --> 01:02:10.650
rather stupendous
efforts, we're still

01:02:10.650 --> 01:02:14.140
in that last tenth of a
millisecond of Earth's attempt

01:02:14.140 --> 01:02:14.920
to do this right.

01:02:14.920 --> 01:02:17.700
We're still the small
fisherman in this business.

01:02:17.700 --> 01:02:20.110
And for it to succeed
at this point,

01:02:20.110 --> 01:02:22.040
we have to be
extraordinarily lucky.

01:02:22.040 --> 01:02:24.930
That's my story, thank you.

01:02:24.930 --> 01:02:26.250
[APPLAUSE]

01:02:31.990 --> 01:02:34.210
Did I leave you questionless?

01:02:34.210 --> 01:02:36.090
Impossible.

01:02:36.090 --> 01:02:37.900
AUDIENCE: So I'm
wondering-- I mean,

01:02:37.900 --> 01:02:40.700
this sort of assumes
that somebody out

01:02:40.700 --> 01:02:43.590
there has identified us as
a potentially interesting

01:02:43.590 --> 01:02:47.740
candidate, and they're
sending a pulse directed at us

01:02:47.740 --> 01:02:50.640
to see if we're listening.

01:02:50.640 --> 01:02:58.170
But what would we look
like to a civilization

01:02:58.170 --> 01:03:03.470
1,000 light years away?

01:03:03.470 --> 01:03:10.780
Like we're sending out
a bunch of RF stuff.

01:03:10.780 --> 01:03:14.050
Is it theoretically
possible for somebody

01:03:14.050 --> 01:03:20.560
to look at what a civilization
that just started emitting

01:03:20.560 --> 01:03:23.000
RF signals would look like?

01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:24.625
PAUL HOROWITZ:
Yeah, good question.

01:03:24.625 --> 01:03:26.500
So the question is,
could we detect ourselves

01:03:26.500 --> 01:03:27.791
with these kind of experiments?

01:03:27.791 --> 01:03:30.550
The answer is no, maybe from
the nearest star, but unlikely.

01:03:30.550 --> 01:03:33.190
Because the radio
signals we're creating

01:03:33.190 --> 01:03:35.760
our not intended to
establish communication.

01:03:35.760 --> 01:03:38.267
They're either piped through
pipes, or they're radars,

01:03:38.267 --> 01:03:40.600
and they're just briefly
pointed in any given direction.

01:03:40.600 --> 01:03:42.260
If they're radars,
they're broadband.

01:03:42.260 --> 01:03:46.239
If they're FM broadcasts,
they're aimed horizontally.

01:03:46.239 --> 01:03:47.280
We're doing it all wrong.

01:03:47.280 --> 01:03:50.780
But we're not looking--
maybe a sufficiently advanced

01:03:50.780 --> 01:03:53.010
civilization could
do huge antennas,

01:03:53.010 --> 01:03:54.590
and find us in our
primitive stage.

01:03:54.590 --> 01:03:56.500
We're looking for
intentional beacons.

01:03:56.500 --> 01:03:58.250
And the idea of those
first couple slides

01:03:58.250 --> 01:04:00.300
is, if we wanted to make
an intentional beacon,

01:04:00.300 --> 01:04:02.812
even with our technology,
we could do it now.

01:04:02.812 --> 01:04:04.520
But we're certainly
looking for something

01:04:04.520 --> 01:04:06.320
optimized in that way.

01:04:06.320 --> 01:04:08.110
And once it's
optimized in that way,

01:04:08.110 --> 01:04:10.970
it becomes detectable
even with our technology.

01:04:10.970 --> 01:04:12.920
But we could not detect
twin if they don't

01:04:12.920 --> 01:04:14.740
go to the effort of doing that.

01:04:14.740 --> 01:04:16.790
Some of these targets
in that breakthrough

01:04:16.790 --> 01:04:18.850
are interested in when
two planets are aligned

01:04:18.850 --> 01:04:20.225
around some other
star, might you

01:04:20.225 --> 01:04:23.400
pick up, by chance, a
communication that's

01:04:23.400 --> 01:04:24.850
between their two planets?

01:04:24.850 --> 01:04:26.891
You know, if you look at
the piece of phase space

01:04:26.891 --> 01:04:29.930
that occupies, the answer
is, what are you smoking?

01:04:29.930 --> 01:04:31.940
It's just too improbable.

01:04:31.940 --> 01:04:34.430
AUDIENCE: So are there any
efforts, or discussion,

01:04:34.430 --> 01:04:38.730
about doing things like picking
star systems with exoplanets,

01:04:38.730 --> 01:04:39.740
and--

01:04:39.740 --> 01:04:41.680
PAUL HOROWITZ: Yeah,
so somewhere in here,

01:04:41.680 --> 01:04:44.886
I had the targets-- I zipped
through at warp speed-- here's

01:04:44.886 --> 01:04:45.760
one thing to look at.

01:04:45.760 --> 01:04:48.010
Nearby stars, why not?

01:04:48.010 --> 01:04:49.020
Nice, strong signal.

01:04:49.020 --> 01:04:52.062
Some night stars--
yeah, because we

01:04:52.062 --> 01:04:53.770
know you can live
around a sun-like star,

01:04:53.770 --> 01:04:54.730
at least for awhile.

01:04:54.730 --> 01:05:00.020
Known exoplanet-- sure, but
that's a pretty small fraction.

01:05:00.020 --> 01:05:02.910
Kepler only picks up planets
that are in our plane,

01:05:02.910 --> 01:05:05.180
so it misses a lot of them.

01:05:05.180 --> 01:05:06.650
Here's this alignment thing.

01:05:06.650 --> 01:05:11.990
I think this is nut case SETI,
but there it is on the list.

01:05:11.990 --> 01:05:14.620
And a few other ideas.

01:05:14.620 --> 01:05:17.570
And the galactic plane, because
there's more demography there.

01:05:17.570 --> 01:05:21.300
And I think, also, not on this
list are other nearby galaxies.

01:05:21.300 --> 01:05:24.150
You point your
beam at Andromeda,

01:05:24.150 --> 01:05:27.455
and you pick up 10 of the
11th stars in one shot.

01:05:27.455 --> 01:05:28.830
And you might say,
oh, but that's

01:05:28.830 --> 01:05:31.626
2 million light years away.

01:05:31.626 --> 01:05:32.500
That's a weak signal.

01:05:32.500 --> 01:05:34.330
Well, think again.

01:05:34.330 --> 01:05:38.120
If Andromeda is trying
to illuminate our galaxy,

01:05:38.120 --> 01:05:40.720
they'll make a beam that
just covers our galaxy.

01:05:40.720 --> 01:05:42.610
Arrives with the same
strength as a signal

01:05:42.610 --> 01:05:44.470
of someone within our
galaxy, also trying

01:05:44.470 --> 01:05:45.794
to illuminate the whole galaxy.

01:05:45.794 --> 01:05:47.460
So it really doesn't
matter how far away

01:05:47.460 --> 01:05:51.420
you are, if you tailor your
beam to match the target size.

01:05:51.420 --> 01:05:53.900
So I think that's a perfectly
reasonable thing to do.

01:05:53.900 --> 01:05:55.380
Did that answer the question?

01:05:55.380 --> 01:05:56.670
AUDIENCE: Sure, thanks.

01:05:56.670 --> 01:05:58.180
PAUL HOROWITZ: Over there.

01:05:58.180 --> 01:06:02.210
AUDIENCE: Possibly,
sort of related-- I

01:06:02.210 --> 01:06:04.370
totally buy the concept
that we are really

01:06:04.370 --> 01:06:08.102
early on the technology side,
in a cosmic scale of time.

01:06:08.102 --> 01:06:10.560
But that's still going to be
true in 50 years, that's still

01:06:10.560 --> 01:06:12.740
going to be true in 500 years.

01:06:12.740 --> 01:06:14.360
What if everybody
feels that way?

01:06:14.360 --> 01:06:15.818
What if they're
all just listening,

01:06:15.818 --> 01:06:18.210
waiting for the other guy to
do the hard part of sending

01:06:18.210 --> 01:06:18.970
signals?

01:06:18.970 --> 01:06:22.886
PAUL HOROWITZ: Yeah, well,
I hate that question.

01:06:22.886 --> 01:06:24.275
[LAUGHTER]

01:06:25.670 --> 01:06:28.442
So I guess I'd say, ask
me again in 500 years.

01:06:28.442 --> 01:06:30.150
You know, there comes
a time in which you

01:06:30.150 --> 01:06:33.770
think you've done a thorough
scouring of receiving,

01:06:33.770 --> 01:06:35.937
given the distances and
what you know about planets.

01:06:35.937 --> 01:06:38.353
You know, we're learning an
awful lot about these planets,

01:06:38.353 --> 01:06:41.160
and I think we're going to
have much smarter searches in

01:06:41.160 --> 01:06:42.141
awhile.

01:06:42.141 --> 01:06:44.640
You'll always be able to make
an argument like that-- maybe,

01:06:44.640 --> 01:06:46.370
ultimately, we'll just decide
we're the only ones there.

01:06:46.370 --> 01:06:47.930
I find that a
completely implausible--

01:06:47.930 --> 01:06:48.550
AUDIENCE: Well, I'm
wondering if there's

01:06:48.550 --> 01:06:51.410
any sense of a technology
that you might expect

01:06:51.410 --> 01:06:53.630
to hit at some
point, where you go,

01:06:53.630 --> 01:06:56.349
oh, wow, we can
send signals now.

01:06:56.349 --> 01:06:58.640
PAUL HOROWITZ: Some people
argue we should be symmetric

01:06:58.640 --> 01:06:59.320
right now.

01:06:59.320 --> 01:07:03.660
I mean, that we only earn the
right to listen if we transmit.

01:07:03.660 --> 01:07:06.820
And I'd say, we'd be so
embarrassed with what we sent,

01:07:06.820 --> 01:07:09.060
if we do it now, because
we're so primitive.

01:07:09.060 --> 01:07:12.760
And the other thing-- so let
me just toss this idea out--

01:07:12.760 --> 01:07:14.570
when we first make
contact, it's not

01:07:14.570 --> 01:07:17.837
going to be the first
time it's ever happened.

01:07:17.837 --> 01:07:20.170
That would be astonishing--
it's happened lots of times.

01:07:20.170 --> 01:07:22.515
And in fact, if there's
sufficiently high density

01:07:22.515 --> 01:07:24.640
of such civilizations, then
they sort of a network,

01:07:24.640 --> 01:07:26.320
they have a galactic internet.

01:07:26.320 --> 01:07:29.710
They've fashioned the
ideal acquisition signal.

01:07:29.710 --> 01:07:32.049
They've done this
a million times--

01:07:32.049 --> 01:07:34.590
it's like the movie, "Contact,"
they know what they're doing.

01:07:34.590 --> 01:07:37.320
And we just go shouting in
there with a bunch of garbage

01:07:37.320 --> 01:07:40.787
and noise like
mumblings, and tell them

01:07:40.787 --> 01:07:42.620
about the wars we're
fighting, and you know,

01:07:42.620 --> 01:07:44.090
is Donald Trump going
to be the president.

01:07:44.090 --> 01:07:45.840
And they're just going
to say, oh, there's

01:07:45.840 --> 01:07:48.470
no intelligent life on Earth.

01:07:48.470 --> 01:07:49.230
[LAUGHTER]

01:07:49.230 --> 01:07:54.600
So no, I think at this point,
we definitely don't transmit.

01:07:54.600 --> 01:07:57.030
Although there are people
who say, that's wrong.

01:07:57.030 --> 01:07:58.580
There's other people who
say we shouldn't transmit,

01:07:58.580 --> 01:07:59.820
because they're going
to come and eat us.

01:07:59.820 --> 01:08:01.579
I think that's kind
of extreme, because I

01:08:01.579 --> 01:08:03.120
think if they can
actually come here,

01:08:03.120 --> 01:08:04.780
then they've grown
up enough to know

01:08:04.780 --> 01:08:06.490
not to go killing stuff off.

01:08:06.490 --> 01:08:08.830
And you can find
argument against this.

01:08:08.830 --> 01:08:14.030
But I guess I can say, in
the next few decades, I'm OK.

01:08:14.030 --> 01:08:16.399
And after that, I don't
have to worry about it,

01:08:16.399 --> 01:08:18.010
because I'm already
73 years old,

01:08:18.010 --> 01:08:21.403
and the average lifespan--
I'm pushing up against that.

01:08:21.403 --> 01:08:24.184
It's your problem.

01:08:24.184 --> 01:08:26.340
[LAUGHTER]

01:08:26.340 --> 01:08:29.962
Are there any other--
there's a question.

01:08:29.962 --> 01:08:34.569
AUDIENCE: So if there are
really advanced civilizations,

01:08:34.569 --> 01:08:36.970
like galactic scale
civilizations,

01:08:36.970 --> 01:08:40.286
do you think that looking
for pulses of light

01:08:40.286 --> 01:08:41.660
from these things
is the only way

01:08:41.660 --> 01:08:43.170
to detect such civilization?

01:08:43.170 --> 01:08:45.457
Or might there be other
things we would look for?

01:08:45.457 --> 01:08:48.040
PAUL HOROWITZ: Yeah, you have
to think about what we know now.

01:08:48.040 --> 01:08:50.123
I mean, we know that
electromagnetic communication

01:08:50.123 --> 01:08:52.500
is cool, and can do the job.

01:08:52.500 --> 01:08:53.970
If the galaxy is
really colonized,

01:08:53.970 --> 01:08:57.080
you might imagine that they
might have robotic probes that

01:08:57.080 --> 01:08:59.334
go in orbit around
likely stars, and where

01:08:59.334 --> 01:09:02.619
they'll have planets, and maybe
do some local back and forth.

01:09:02.619 --> 01:09:04.160
Wouldn't that be a
smart thing to do?

01:09:04.160 --> 01:09:07.460
People who have looked for stuff
like that haven't found it.

01:09:07.460 --> 01:09:10.270
I think if we discover new
modalities of communication,

01:09:10.270 --> 01:09:11.020
they're fair game.

01:09:11.020 --> 01:09:13.000
But from what we
know now, we don't

01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:15.238
like particles that have
mass, they go too slow,

01:09:15.238 --> 01:09:16.279
and take too much energy.

01:09:16.279 --> 01:09:17.670
We don't like charged
particles, because they

01:09:17.670 --> 01:09:19.850
bend in magnetic fields,
and they scatter.

01:09:19.850 --> 01:09:23.266
We don't like neutrinos, and
gravity waves, gravitons,

01:09:23.266 --> 01:09:25.140
because they're too hard
to make and detect--

01:09:25.140 --> 01:09:27.930
and this is certainly
decent physics.

01:09:27.930 --> 01:09:33.660
Whereas, spin one mass
zero, electromagnetic waves,

01:09:33.660 --> 01:09:35.910
just seem to have all the
right characteristics there.

01:09:35.910 --> 01:09:37.830
It works at extremely
sensitive level,

01:09:37.830 --> 01:09:39.580
and they go at the
speed of light-- that's

01:09:39.580 --> 01:09:42.361
as fast as you get to go.

01:09:42.361 --> 01:09:44.069
But we're certainly
open to other things.

01:09:44.069 --> 01:09:47.821
And if there is a
galactic network,

01:09:47.821 --> 01:09:49.029
they'll eventually notice us.

01:09:49.029 --> 01:09:52.340
Maybe to join the club, we
need to detect their signal.

01:09:52.340 --> 01:09:54.900
Maybe they don't
like getting in touch

01:09:54.900 --> 01:09:56.940
with too primitive
civilizations,

01:09:56.940 --> 01:10:00.010
and we haven't earned
our entrance ticket yet.

01:10:00.010 --> 01:10:03.332
But this is all
crazy speculation.

01:10:03.332 --> 01:10:05.290
You can speculate about
it, but if you actually

01:10:05.290 --> 01:10:07.748
want to make something happen,
you go look for the signals,

01:10:07.748 --> 01:10:10.440
and do it the best way you can.

01:10:10.440 --> 01:10:16.300
AUDIENCE: Hi, so how well can
you plausibly aim a laser?

01:10:16.300 --> 01:10:19.820
Right now, if we wanted to,
and NASA would shoot it up

01:10:19.820 --> 01:10:22.370
into space, or whatever we
were going to do with it,

01:10:22.370 --> 01:10:26.220
could we pick a star
at 70 light years,

01:10:26.220 --> 01:10:28.520
and say there is an
earth orbit around that,

01:10:28.520 --> 01:10:32.600
and we want to bathe that
orbit in light-- we could

01:10:32.600 --> 01:10:34.185
we hit that point in space?

01:10:34.185 --> 01:10:36.810
PAUL HOROWITZ: Yeah, actually it
was part of that nerd box that

01:10:36.810 --> 01:10:37.950
had a lot of stuff in there.

01:10:37.950 --> 01:10:39.700
Talked about the size--
you would actually

01:10:39.700 --> 01:10:41.370
would have to broaden it.

01:10:41.370 --> 01:10:46.490
The calculation I did was
for a 1-au target diameter

01:10:46.490 --> 01:10:48.840
at-- I forget what
the distance was, I

01:10:48.840 --> 01:10:51.590
think it was 1,000 light years.

01:10:51.590 --> 01:10:54.552
And that's diffraction limited
for the 10-meter telescope.

01:10:54.552 --> 01:10:56.260
If you want to spread
it out, because you

01:10:56.260 --> 01:10:58.593
think the planets might be
further out, you can do that,

01:10:58.593 --> 01:11:00.605
and it reduces the flux
by the square of the--

01:11:00.605 --> 01:11:01.521
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

01:11:01.521 --> 01:11:04.201
PAUL HOROWITZ: Yeah, well, not
going through the atmosphere,

01:11:04.201 --> 01:11:04.700
you can't.

01:11:04.700 --> 01:11:06.710
And so this would have
to be an orbital thing.

01:11:06.710 --> 01:11:08.918
And the question is, can
you do fractional arcsecond?

01:11:08.918 --> 01:11:11.520
You can do diffraction limited
with a 10-meter telescope.

01:11:11.520 --> 01:11:13.534
And we're going to
get better at that.

01:11:13.534 --> 01:11:15.450
I mean, it's really easy
in space-- everything

01:11:15.450 --> 01:11:16.590
is very quiet.

01:11:16.590 --> 01:11:18.840
There's no weather,
there's no wind,

01:11:18.840 --> 01:11:20.110
you don't get snow advisories.

01:11:22.589 --> 01:11:24.630
Or the backside of the
moon might be a good place

01:11:24.630 --> 01:11:27.340
to put a telescopes, you
know it's quiet there, too,

01:11:27.340 --> 01:11:29.220
and it shields you from
all the interference

01:11:29.220 --> 01:11:32.030
from Earth, if you want
to do that kind of thing.

01:11:32.030 --> 01:11:32.930
Another one?

01:11:32.930 --> 01:11:35.220
Yes.

01:11:35.220 --> 01:11:37.567
AUDIENCE: I've got a really
down to earth question.

01:11:37.567 --> 01:11:39.650
In the edition of your
book I have-- it's probably

01:11:39.650 --> 01:11:42.500
the second, if the third
one is the new one-- there's

01:11:42.500 --> 01:11:44.040
this wonderful
looking technology

01:11:44.040 --> 01:11:46.970
where you put these
sticky wires on a board,

01:11:46.970 --> 01:11:49.785
and you can prototype your
thing without a circuit mill,

01:11:49.785 --> 01:11:51.230
or without any chemicals.

01:11:51.230 --> 01:11:52.880
And that disappeared.

01:11:52.880 --> 01:11:54.312
Do you know why?

01:11:54.312 --> 01:11:56.770
PAUL HOROWITZ: Gee, I remember--
I had forgotten completely

01:11:56.770 --> 01:11:58.854
about that.

01:11:58.854 --> 01:12:00.270
AUDIENCE: A
Kollmorgen multi-wire.

01:12:00.270 --> 01:12:01.940
PAUL HOROWITZ: Yeah,
so what it did was,

01:12:01.940 --> 01:12:05.380
it was basically an alternative
to the PCBs, or wire wrap.

01:12:05.380 --> 01:12:08.740
And what it did was it just spit
out a sticky, inflated wire,

01:12:08.740 --> 01:12:10.590
they could cross
over each other.

01:12:10.590 --> 01:12:15.132
I remember, I got a board for
a nova that was a video board,

01:12:15.132 --> 01:12:16.590
and it was made by
a local company,

01:12:16.590 --> 01:12:17.880
and they did it with the system.

01:12:17.880 --> 01:12:19.410
And they went around, and
when it got to the pad

01:12:19.410 --> 01:12:20.640
that it was supposed
to go to-- everything

01:12:20.640 --> 01:12:22.910
was through hole in those
days, it actually just made

01:12:22.910 --> 01:12:24.550
a welded spot-- and
so the wires could

01:12:24.550 --> 01:12:26.160
cross with reckless abandon.

01:12:26.160 --> 01:12:28.540
You didn't need multiple
layers or anything else.

01:12:28.540 --> 01:12:29.750
Why did it disappear?

01:12:29.750 --> 01:12:32.090
It's probably a crappy way
to make more than one board

01:12:32.090 --> 01:12:35.490
of anything, and etch boards
are much more effective--

01:12:35.490 --> 01:12:36.826
particularly a multi-layer.

01:12:36.826 --> 01:12:38.700
I don't know-- wire-wrap
kind of disappeared.

01:12:38.700 --> 01:12:40.401
AUDIENCE: The problem was the
pulling from the [INAUDIBLE]

01:12:40.401 --> 01:12:40.890
if you flexed them.

01:12:40.890 --> 01:12:41.787
PAUL HOROWITZ: Is that right?

01:12:41.787 --> 01:12:43.162
AUDIENCE: I heard
that somewhere.

01:12:43.162 --> 01:12:44.820
PAUL HOROWITZ: So
don't flex them.

01:12:44.820 --> 01:12:46.360
AUDIENCE: You had to have
board stiffeners on it.

01:12:46.360 --> 01:12:47.750
PAUL HOROWITZ: I mean,
who would ever think

01:12:47.750 --> 01:12:48.999
that surface mount could work?

01:12:48.999 --> 01:12:50.661
You have these
little ceramic chips,

01:12:50.661 --> 01:12:52.160
and you're soldering
both ends down.

01:12:52.160 --> 01:12:55.970
And now it's on a board, and
you go like that, why don't they

01:12:55.970 --> 01:12:59.150
just all pop off?

01:12:59.150 --> 01:13:01.119
You know when you shove
the heat sink down,

01:13:01.119 --> 01:13:02.910
when you stick the CPU
on your motherboard,

01:13:02.910 --> 01:13:04.150
and then you push
that thing down,

01:13:04.150 --> 01:13:06.760
and it's supposed to snap in,
and the board goes like that?

01:13:06.760 --> 01:13:08.180
And you know it's all
full of these little--

01:13:08.180 --> 01:13:09.250
why don't they all just
[MAKING EXPLOSION SOUND]

01:13:09.250 --> 01:13:11.000
like that, and fly into the air?

01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:13.755
They don't, but
it shouldn't work.

01:13:13.755 --> 01:13:15.120
[LAUGHTER]

01:13:15.120 --> 01:13:16.800
Jim Williams, at
Linear Technology,

01:13:16.800 --> 01:13:18.510
used to say all the things
that shouldn't work.

01:13:18.510 --> 01:13:19.843
He says, disc brakes can't work.

01:13:19.843 --> 01:13:22.330
He said, ball point pen,
I would've fired that guy.

01:13:24.999 --> 01:13:26.540
So you can make
things work, you just

01:13:26.540 --> 01:13:28.932
have to work hard
to make them work.

01:13:28.932 --> 01:13:31.140
AUDIENCE: A theme that
recurred throughout the course

01:13:31.140 --> 01:13:34.881
or your talk was the advances
in technology over time.

01:13:34.881 --> 01:13:36.380
And corresponding
with that, there's

01:13:36.380 --> 01:13:38.770
also a decrease in the cost
for any given unit of, say,

01:13:38.770 --> 01:13:40.540
computing power over time.

01:13:40.540 --> 01:13:42.520
And something I thought
was really cool that

01:13:42.520 --> 01:13:46.437
happened a year or so ago,
was the IS EE3 reboot project,

01:13:46.437 --> 01:13:48.020
where a bunch of
guys in Mountain View

01:13:48.020 --> 01:13:50.330
took over McDonald's, and
took over a NASA probe,

01:13:50.330 --> 01:13:52.144
and tried to adjust
its orbit, and so on.

01:13:52.144 --> 01:13:54.560
And they failed, because there
was no pressure [INAUDIBLE]

01:13:54.560 --> 01:13:58.860
in the fuel tank for the thing--
but this ideas of reclaiming

01:13:58.860 --> 01:14:00.960
old technology at
the individual level.

01:14:00.960 --> 01:14:04.595
And now I'm kind of wondering
what your thoughts are on,

01:14:04.595 --> 01:14:06.220
at the individual
level, somebody who's

01:14:06.220 --> 01:14:08.320
interested in the stuff,
going into their basement

01:14:08.320 --> 01:14:11.860
and building a device with
the same computational power--

01:14:11.860 --> 01:14:14.820
the meta array that you guys
built in the '70s and '80s--

01:14:14.820 --> 01:14:16.950
and trying to do the same
experiments you guys were

01:14:16.950 --> 01:14:17.180
doing.

01:14:17.180 --> 01:14:18.305
Is there any merit to that?

01:14:18.305 --> 01:14:20.930
Does that add scientific value?

01:14:20.930 --> 01:14:22.670
PAUL HOROWITZ:
Yeah, interesting.

01:14:22.670 --> 01:14:24.640
So this big supernova
that was just

01:14:24.640 --> 01:14:26.730
discovered this
week, or last week,

01:14:26.730 --> 01:14:29.620
was found with a bunch of
automated small telescopes,

01:14:29.620 --> 01:14:31.660
that's run with a
small consortium.

01:14:31.660 --> 01:14:34.650
And there's nothing there
that's beyond amateur status,

01:14:34.650 --> 01:14:37.910
in particular-- by amateur,
I don't mean not smart,

01:14:37.910 --> 01:14:39.590
I mean doing it for the love.

01:14:39.590 --> 01:14:41.190
That's where the
word comes from.

01:14:41.190 --> 01:14:42.815
You can do an awful
lot of computation,

01:14:42.815 --> 01:14:44.290
and as that graph
showed about how

01:14:44.290 --> 01:14:46.835
you build your big
telescopes, the computations

01:14:46.835 --> 01:14:49.210
is where it's at if you have
a bunch of small telescopes.

01:14:49.210 --> 01:14:51.210
And you can do amazing things.

01:14:51.210 --> 01:14:53.720
So I think that amateur
astronomers are definitely

01:14:53.720 --> 01:14:56.280
in play, particularly when
the phase space that you have

01:14:56.280 --> 01:14:59.300
to explore is the whole sky,
and most of these projects

01:14:59.300 --> 01:15:02.010
are looking through soda
straws at particular places.

01:15:02.010 --> 01:15:03.760
I think there's
definite chances.

01:15:03.760 --> 01:15:06.741
In fact, you might say, why
aren't these signals strong?

01:15:06.741 --> 01:15:08.490
Given that even now,
we could make signals

01:15:08.490 --> 01:15:09.800
that are quite detectable.

01:15:09.800 --> 01:15:13.860
We can make a CW laser
at 100 megawatts,

01:15:13.860 --> 01:15:16.070
diffraction limited, is
much brighter than a star.

01:15:16.070 --> 01:15:17.570
It would be a
spectral [INAUDIBLE]--

01:15:17.570 --> 01:15:19.900
a star would turn
suddenly green or blue.

01:15:19.900 --> 01:15:21.765
Why don't we see those things?

01:15:21.765 --> 01:15:23.140
Well, probably
because they don't

01:15:23.140 --> 01:15:26.287
need to go that much overboard
to bring a new civilization in.

01:15:26.287 --> 01:15:28.620
But if they're interested in
bringing a new civilization

01:15:28.620 --> 01:15:32.520
in before we blow ourselves
up, or elect a really

01:15:32.520 --> 01:15:36.450
untenable president,
then it may pay for them

01:15:36.450 --> 01:15:37.710
to send pretty strong signals.

01:15:37.710 --> 01:15:41.244
In which case, I think
one-meter class telescopes,

01:15:41.244 --> 01:15:42.660
or robotic telescopes
on which you

01:15:42.660 --> 01:15:45.760
can drive some stream of data
from it, or these data streams

01:15:45.760 --> 01:15:47.640
can be split and provided
to multiple users,

01:15:47.640 --> 01:15:50.290
I think it's definitely
a thing to do.

01:15:50.290 --> 01:15:55.066
And with the availability
of cheap GPUs, and FPGAs,

01:15:55.066 --> 01:15:56.940
and boards that do all
this stuff-- you know,

01:15:56.940 --> 01:15:58.940
the Adafruit and SparkFunds
of the world, really

01:15:58.940 --> 01:16:00.210
make this easy stuff.

01:16:00.210 --> 01:16:04.722
So I say go for it,
and report back.

01:16:04.722 --> 01:16:07.180
AUDIENCE: I remember there was
a SETI at Home program, that

01:16:07.180 --> 01:16:10.440
would take spare compute cycles
and go off and look at signals.

01:16:10.440 --> 01:16:11.404
Is that still ongoing?

01:16:11.404 --> 01:16:13.820
PAUL HOROWITZ: Yeah, in fact
SETI at Home, so SETI at HOME

01:16:13.820 --> 01:16:15.730
is run out of Berkeley
by the same folks

01:16:15.730 --> 01:16:17.890
who bring you this Casper
project and the FPGAs

01:16:17.890 --> 01:16:18.710
that I showed you.

01:16:18.710 --> 01:16:22.880
And SETI at home takes data
from the Arecibo telescope.

01:16:22.880 --> 01:16:24.520
The Arecibo telescope
is this dish

01:16:24.520 --> 01:16:25.850
with the thing sticking down.

01:16:25.850 --> 01:16:28.960
And because they want to keep
pointing at the same thing,

01:16:28.960 --> 01:16:31.420
the feed has to move, so
the thing swivels around

01:16:31.420 --> 01:16:33.350
and goes in and out.

01:16:33.350 --> 01:16:35.760
And other feed isn't
doing anything--

01:16:35.760 --> 01:16:36.940
it's doing curlicues.

01:16:36.940 --> 01:16:39.490
So SETI at Home took data
from the curlicue feed

01:16:39.490 --> 01:16:41.804
that nobody wanted, and
basically parsed it up

01:16:41.804 --> 01:16:43.470
and sent it all the
way out to everybody

01:16:43.470 --> 01:16:44.780
to run on their things.

01:16:44.780 --> 01:16:48.155
And there's wonderful maps of
the sky, as curlicued with SETI

01:16:48.155 --> 01:16:49.260
at Home.

01:16:49.260 --> 01:16:50.560
That's alive and well.

01:16:50.560 --> 01:16:53.080
And in fact, this new
project Breakthrough

01:16:53.080 --> 01:16:55.280
is going to make
public all of its data

01:16:55.280 --> 01:16:59.440
in some form that's actually
usable-- not the full 320

01:16:59.440 --> 01:17:03.160
gigabits per second, but some
cleaned up version of that.

01:17:03.160 --> 01:17:07.230
Part of their mandate is
not to sit on this data.

01:17:07.230 --> 01:17:09.320
The same way Kepler
data is made public,

01:17:09.320 --> 01:17:13.410
and the public Genome Project
published their stuff, too.

01:17:13.410 --> 01:17:16.400
So if what you want
to do is software

01:17:16.400 --> 01:17:19.485
on someone else's data, you'll
have more than you can handle.

01:17:19.485 --> 01:17:21.360
And I don't know if
that's going to be turned

01:17:21.360 --> 01:17:22.990
into-- I see flashing lights.

01:17:22.990 --> 01:17:26.060
That could be a laser pulse
from alien intelligence,

01:17:26.060 --> 01:17:29.490
or it could be a sign that
I'm supposed to stop talking.

01:17:29.490 --> 01:17:31.080
I think the latter.

01:17:31.080 --> 01:17:32.580
Thank you.

01:17:32.580 --> 01:17:35.030
[APPLAUSE]
