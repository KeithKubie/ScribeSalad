1
00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:03,130
[inaudible].

2
00:00:05,030 --> 00:00:05,251
All right.

3
00:00:05,251 --> 00:00:09,070
So I want to shift a little bit to foreign
policy because I think that's sort of,

4
00:00:09,090 --> 00:00:12,570
uh, one of your, one of your, would you
say that's one of your main strengths?

5
00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:16,530
So my claim to fame was counter
terrorism and stuff like this, but,

6
00:00:16,531 --> 00:00:21,300
but really deep down, I'm a strategy wank.
Yeah. Grand Strategy is my thing. Okay.

7
00:00:21,301 --> 00:00:23,880
So we'll talk,
we'll talk in the lens and strategy then.

8
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:27,010
So as we're taping this right now,
I mentioned earlier, it's gonna,

9
00:00:27,030 --> 00:00:29,520
it's gonna sit on the shelf
for a couple of days. Um,

10
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:31,770
so I don't want to get too lost
in anything that happened today,

11
00:00:31,771 --> 00:00:34,990
but at the moment it's a little
upside down in Syria. We don't,

12
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:37,500
there might've been strikes already
from when we're taping this.

13
00:00:37,820 --> 00:00:42,630
Hungary just had elections. Um, in your
Wikipedia that I referenced earlier,

14
00:00:42,631 --> 00:00:46,470
it says you work through for the guy
who just won you apparently you never

15
00:00:46,471 --> 00:00:50,180
worked for him. You don't want to face
potty. I wasn't victim Audubon's advising,

16
00:00:50,490 --> 00:00:52,940
which is what it says. We
have the PD at least. Um,

17
00:00:53,010 --> 00:00:57,000
what's your general thoughts on
foreign policy strategy? Like,

18
00:00:57,001 --> 00:00:58,650
what is a sensible

19
00:00:58,940 --> 00:01:03,330
policy and, and his Trump
applying that view. Uh,

20
00:01:03,350 --> 00:01:05,030
first things first,
uh,

21
00:01:05,210 --> 00:01:08,840
the great irony of all nation is that
we are the most powerful nation in the

22
00:01:08,841 --> 00:01:09,980
world has ever seen.

23
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:14,300
And until recently we have been the
dumbest and most a strategic. I mean,

24
00:01:14,301 --> 00:01:15,620
we haven't done,

25
00:01:15,740 --> 00:01:20,540
we haven't thought or acted
strategically since about 1989.

26
00:01:20,541 --> 00:01:24,320
November the ninth when the Berlin
Wall fell. And this is, you know, um,

27
00:01:24,650 --> 00:01:27,580
how have we active, what would you
say that since then it's just, Oh,

28
00:01:27,590 --> 00:01:30,770
well we want security.
Nineties was just this kind of confused.

29
00:01:31,010 --> 00:01:35,240
What is national security about
lurching for the snooze button.

30
00:01:35,241 --> 00:01:36,950
Just who are the threats?

31
00:01:36,951 --> 00:01:40,110
Is it China is a weapons of mass
destruction and say you can slog it.

32
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:44,480
It was just a mess.
And then we had 2001 and nine 11,

33
00:01:44,510 --> 00:01:48,020
and we had just neo con disasters.

34
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:49,880
There's not an accident.

35
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:53,150
These guys were former Trotskyites
because there's so naive,

36
00:01:53,190 --> 00:01:54,390
the way they look at the world,

37
00:01:54,391 --> 00:01:58,760
that we're going to create democracy
at the end of a gun barrel in a country

38
00:01:58,761 --> 00:02:03,761
with 36 languages that defeated Alexander
the Great and the British empire and

39
00:02:04,521 --> 00:02:09,230
the Soviets. You couldn't be stupid or
if you tried. So, you know, we, we, we,

40
00:02:09,231 --> 00:02:13,700
we've done some very, very foolish things
because we haven't stuck to the basics.

41
00:02:13,970 --> 00:02:16,670
Strategy at the end of the
day is about one thing.

42
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:21,580
It's about prioritization
based upon interests, right?

43
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:25,160
You've got to say some things are more
important than others. And guess what?

44
00:02:25,250 --> 00:02:30,170
Some countries are more important than
others. And in a postmodern secular world,

45
00:02:30,171 --> 00:02:34,760
you're not allowed to or
know all countries or Vanuatu
is as important as Turkey

46
00:02:34,850 --> 00:02:37,790
wrong. It's partly, I mean, I love
the people that I out too, but no,

47
00:02:37,791 --> 00:02:42,620
it's not a geo strategic input to the,
to the country of America. So number one,

48
00:02:42,621 --> 00:02:45,680
we have to prioritize.
And I think this administration,

49
00:02:46,010 --> 00:02:50,330
I doff my cap to Nadia, shadow
low, uh, uh, HR mcmasters deputy,

50
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:53,870
she held the pen in the meetings that
I was in on the new national security

51
00:02:53,871 --> 00:02:56,090
strategy of America.
And I tell you, David,

52
00:02:56,120 --> 00:03:01,120
it is the first document of that name
in 30 years that deserves the name

53
00:03:01,421 --> 00:03:03,820
national security strategy.
Every administration has them.

54
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,660
This is the first one that says, this is
what we stand for. These are our values,

55
00:03:07,690 --> 00:03:08,560
these are our friends,

56
00:03:08,561 --> 00:03:12,250
these are our enemies and this is what
we're going to prioritize. Prior to that,

57
00:03:12,251 --> 00:03:15,700
it was laundry list of well we're
going to have to front walls,

58
00:03:15,701 --> 00:03:20,590
we're going to save the whales. And you
know, no. So you have to prioritize.

59
00:03:20,591 --> 00:03:24,650
And finally this administration
is about America first. Uh,

60
00:03:24,670 --> 00:03:27,850
we are not isolationists
nor are we interventionists.

61
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:32,560
This is really annoys me that if you're
a conservative for 20 years you were

62
00:03:32,561 --> 00:03:33,550
given two options,

63
00:03:33,820 --> 00:03:38,820
button a invade other people's
countries and occupy them button B,

64
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:42,610
B around the Sta and close the,
you know,

65
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:45,550
the curtains on the Pacific
and the Atlantic and say,

66
00:03:45,580 --> 00:03:46,870
we don't care about anybody else.

67
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:49,720
Well guess what is the most
powerful nation in the world?

68
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:51,700
There is a large pallet of options.

69
00:03:52,590 --> 00:03:55,720
It's gotta be something in the middle of
their, yeah. So it's about being smart.

70
00:03:56,020 --> 00:04:00,850
It's about our interests.
And to summarize the president's approach,

71
00:04:01,090 --> 00:04:02,530
this isn't official,
but I like it.

72
00:04:02,531 --> 00:04:07,240
We have numerous former generals and
active generals from the Marine Corps at

73
00:04:07,241 --> 00:04:09,460
the highest level of the administration
should have the joint chiefs,

74
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:11,350
Chief of staff,
secretary defense.

75
00:04:11,710 --> 00:04:14,800
And the interesting thing is they all
come from the same Marine Corps division,

76
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:20,050
not just the Marine Corps, the same
division. And that division has a motto,

77
00:04:21,310 --> 00:04:25,750
no better friend, no worse
enemy. That's America first.

78
00:04:26,590 --> 00:04:31,240
So when you see someone like John
Bolton, uh, now part of the cabinet,

79
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:35,020
and if you were to look on, you know, not
that you can get truth out of Twitter,

80
00:04:35,021 --> 00:04:37,210
but the day it was happening,
you know,

81
00:04:37,390 --> 00:04:40,000
everybody's saying this is going to
start world war three and you know,

82
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:43,930
just the general hysterics. And now John
Bolton is definitely private suspect.

83
00:04:43,931 --> 00:04:46,860
More of a neo con then you're
comfortable with, is that,

84
00:04:46,861 --> 00:04:50,150
I don't think it's fair
to them. Naoko I, I don't,

85
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:54,020
I don't think he's ideologically driven.
If you watch the videos that he,

86
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:54,380
you know,

87
00:04:54,380 --> 00:04:58,030
we're recording of his speech is 20
years ago he was sounding very much like

88
00:04:58,031 --> 00:05:00,910
Trump, we're American, we have interests.
You want to work with us, fight.

89
00:05:00,911 --> 00:05:02,230
If you don't,
there's a problem.

90
00:05:02,231 --> 00:05:06,340
So I think it's very telling that within
40 minutes of the president's tweet

91
00:05:06,341 --> 00:05:09,160
about John Coming on board,
um,

92
00:05:09,220 --> 00:05:13,810
massive Balkan gave an interview on Fox
and they asked them about what are you

93
00:05:13,811 --> 00:05:15,370
going to be like as a
national security advisor?

94
00:05:15,370 --> 00:05:20,210
And he gave a very interesting answer.
He quoted Dean Acheson and you know, the,

95
00:05:20,211 --> 00:05:24,050
the, the Doyenne of foreign
policy in America. And uh,

96
00:05:24,070 --> 00:05:25,360
I don't know if this is true story,

97
00:05:25,361 --> 00:05:28,160
but John said the mattress
than was once once asked,

98
00:05:28,570 --> 00:05:32,200
how do you have such a good relationship
with the president you serve and the

99
00:05:32,201 --> 00:05:35,230
mattress and said, well, it's very easy.

100
00:05:35,231 --> 00:05:39,850
We may disagree on policy issues,
but at the end of the day,

101
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:42,640
I never forget who was elected president.

102
00:05:42,970 --> 00:05:45,280
And it wasn't me that uh,

103
00:05:45,281 --> 00:05:49,930
John Bolton 2.0 he understands that
unlike his predecessor HR McMaster,

104
00:05:50,170 --> 00:05:55,170
he's not there to lecture the president
or foist his version of what you should

105
00:05:55,601 --> 00:05:56,920
do onto the commodity and chief.

106
00:05:57,200 --> 00:06:00,890
He's at to be an honest broker and
provide a palliative options because guess

107
00:06:00,891 --> 00:06:03,920
who gets to decide the person
who was elected president.

108
00:06:03,921 --> 00:06:06,410
So I am very excited about John and I,
I'm,

109
00:06:06,710 --> 00:06:11,670
I'm as excited about Mike Palm coming
from the CIA to the State Department that

110
00:06:11,870 --> 00:06:15,400
we are in. Very good hands,
David. So how do you make sure if,

111
00:06:15,401 --> 00:06:19,490
if it's between the pure isolationists
and, and the neo cons or something,

112
00:06:19,491 --> 00:06:21,410
something like the nation builders,
something like that.

113
00:06:21,710 --> 00:06:26,180
How do you make sure that not everything
that you do outside of our borders

114
00:06:26,181 --> 00:06:30,860
becomes something much bigger? I mean,
look, we're still at war in Afghanistan.

115
00:06:31,130 --> 00:06:33,450
I don't think anyone knows
why at the, I mean, can you,

116
00:06:33,460 --> 00:06:36,930
can you tell me why we're
at war in Afghanistan? Can
anyone tell, tell you is why,

117
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:41,890
why we went, why we went to
Afghanistan in October of [inaudible].

118
00:06:41,891 --> 00:06:45,590
One is the only reason we should be
that today. Nothing's changed. Okay?

119
00:06:46,310 --> 00:06:48,380
The idea that goes go to school.
I love it.

120
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:52,130
I get it that people can listen to music
freely and the Taliban load execute you.

121
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:56,480
My parents lived under communism.
My father suffered under fascism.

122
00:06:56,630 --> 00:07:00,260
He protected his fellow Jewish classmates
during the occupation of Budapest.

123
00:07:00,290 --> 00:07:02,570
I get it.
I don't like those kinds of systems,

124
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:06,760
but there's only one reason we're there
to make sure that that piece of land

125
00:07:06,761 --> 00:07:11,761
less would never ever again be used
to execute mass casualty attacks in

126
00:07:12,051 --> 00:07:16,880
Manhattan, in Washington or in a
field in Pennsylvania. End of story.

127
00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:19,310
It's not about building
a ring road around Kabul.

128
00:07:19,311 --> 00:07:22,520
The not even the Soviets could finish.
It's not about building hospitals.

129
00:07:22,521 --> 00:07:25,370
I'm sorry. You never make the
ideal, the enemy of the good.

130
00:07:25,730 --> 00:07:30,730
What the president does is he looks
at things as questions of possibility.

131
00:07:31,850 --> 00:07:35,860
You cannot be a massively successful
realtor in the toughest market in New York

132
00:07:35,910 --> 00:07:37,790
or in the world which
in New York real estate.

133
00:07:38,420 --> 00:07:41,450
If you have a filter that
distorts reality, I mean,

134
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:46,370
either this square footage is worth x
or it's not worth x according to the

135
00:07:46,371 --> 00:07:48,980
market.
And that's how he approaches these issues.

136
00:07:48,980 --> 00:07:53,630
So Afghanistan's only important to make
sure bad guys don't use it again to kill

137
00:07:53,631 --> 00:07:57,350
Americans in America. So you, so
you would say, or at least if you,

138
00:07:57,390 --> 00:08:00,290
if you had to guesstimate
basically what he believes,

139
00:08:00,291 --> 00:08:03,920
you would say that he believes that
still keeping us there at the moment is

140
00:08:03,921 --> 00:08:06,920
still accomplishing. Yeah. Oh, I don't
have to guesstimate. I can tell you that.

141
00:08:07,310 --> 00:08:07,820
Yeah.

142
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:10,620
So you believe that as well because it
just seems unclear and it has nothing

143
00:08:10,621 --> 00:08:13,460
that has nothing to do. He will.
He will never, I tell you right.

144
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:17,180
This 71 year old man who is now the most
powerful man in the world will never,

145
00:08:17,390 --> 00:08:18,170
ever,

146
00:08:18,170 --> 00:08:23,170
ever buy into a nation building scenario
anywhere outside of the United States.

147
00:08:24,530 --> 00:08:27,170
Not happening for the next seven years.
End of story.

148
00:08:27,350 --> 00:08:32,350
And the idea that you have my followers
on Twitter tearing their hair out,

149
00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:36,710
the boltons going to house in Syria,

150
00:08:37,010 --> 00:08:39,710
guys got a grip on reality.

151
00:08:39,710 --> 00:08:44,210
And stop talking about crisis
actors and 10 fold hot garbage.

152
00:08:44,510 --> 00:08:47,000
It's not going to happen while
the president's the president.

153
00:08:47,030 --> 00:08:50,240
Well that I tweeted something to that
effect the day of the Bolton thing because

154
00:08:50,241 --> 00:08:54,560
it also reminds me that people don't
understand basic deterrence that you have

155
00:08:54,561 --> 00:08:57,090
to bring in people that you know,

156
00:08:57,091 --> 00:09:01,080
talk a big game so that perhaps
radio hello. Yeah. Right.

157
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:03,600
The man who was going to take us to war.
What did he do?

158
00:09:04,170 --> 00:09:09,170
I think the success in North Korea today
has in large part being pop had been

159
00:09:09,390 --> 00:09:13,560
uh, uh, thanks to his tweets because
that's how you deal with the potatoes.

160
00:09:14,070 --> 00:09:18,120
You make fun of them, they hate
that. And then you ridicule them,

161
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:23,190
right? And then you do what? You
scare them. Oh, and Lo and behold,

162
00:09:23,191 --> 00:09:26,220
they want to negotiate for the
first time in 65 years. Well,

163
00:09:26,221 --> 00:09:27,060
isn't that interesting?

164
00:09:27,270 --> 00:09:30,090
Do you think there's any chance
he would ever give up his nukes?

165
00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:36,480
About 3% because at that point, what
leverage does he have left? Right.

166
00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:40,440
So that you still think it's worth having
the talks to figure out what we can,

167
00:09:40,441 --> 00:09:44,490
absolutely. Because what's happened for
the last 25 years? Escalation, escalation,

168
00:09:44,491 --> 00:09:48,990
escalation. I mean we, we have given into
nuclear blackmail since Bill Clinton. Uh,

169
00:09:48,991 --> 00:09:50,640
so yeah, we, we have to
at the end of the day,

170
00:09:50,641 --> 00:09:55,530
we have to remember in 1953 was not a
peace treaty in 1953 in Korea was a cease

171
00:09:55,531 --> 00:09:56,700
firing and all MREs.

172
00:09:57,240 --> 00:10:01,470
That is actually a war that's just
simply been frozen for 65 years.

173
00:10:01,650 --> 00:10:05,010
Would be nice to have a little bit
of a peace treaty or something. Yeah.

174
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:10,160
How much of what's happening
in the world right now? Do you,

175
00:10:10,161 --> 00:10:11,130
you must be thrilled,

176
00:10:11,131 --> 00:10:16,020
I assume with everything going on at the
UN that Nikki Haley is basically walked

177
00:10:16,021 --> 00:10:20,610
in there and, and John Bolton 2.0
yeah. Yeah. I mean, she strikes me as,

178
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:24,270
I almost wondered, did Trump really know
what he was getting with high Billy?

179
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:27,270
Yeah. Did anyone know? Anybody?
Did? Yeah. Where, where did the,

180
00:10:27,271 --> 00:10:29,360
did you know her at all?
Where do you think that that of,

181
00:10:29,361 --> 00:10:33,270
I don't know her as a friend.
Um, she found herself,

182
00:10:34,020 --> 00:10:36,580
she found herself in more power to her.
What,

183
00:10:36,581 --> 00:10:38,730
what usefulness do you see
in the UN at this point?

184
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:43,500
Because it seems like truly it seems
like the most corrupt should be backwards

185
00:10:43,530 --> 00:10:46,650
pushed into the river. I mean really,
I mean, well, the buildings basically

186
00:10:50,270 --> 00:10:52,730
now they're going to quote that and
go, you see, he was calling for,

187
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:55,260
to be knocking to the river. Um, look,

188
00:10:55,290 --> 00:11:00,290
the idea was a good idea
in 1945 in San Francisco,

189
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:06,360
let's have an organization that stops
us from killing 60 million people again.

190
00:11:07,820 --> 00:11:08,653
Um,

191
00:11:09,090 --> 00:11:14,090
but when you lock in dictatorships
like China and Russia into the Security

192
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:18,450
Council with veto power
and then you create this,

193
00:11:18,540 --> 00:11:22,680
this empire of UN organizations,
I mean,

194
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:27,240
has there been a year in the last 20
years that we haven't seen a UN scandal,

195
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:29,070
whether it's money for oil,

196
00:11:29,071 --> 00:11:32,800
whether it's UN troops
raping children in Africa?

197
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:36,750
Have we seen it one year without
a UN scandal? I don't think so.

198
00:11:36,751 --> 00:11:41,751
So try and reform it and if you calm was
questioned the validity of what it does

199
00:11:42,511 --> 00:11:44,850
or forget. I don't talking about,
you know, the, the, the, the,

200
00:11:44,851 --> 00:11:48,810
the children's rights organizations
and food, food security.

201
00:11:49,020 --> 00:11:51,690
I'm talking about its main mission,
which is stability and safety.

202
00:11:51,930 --> 00:11:53,980
It's failed abysmally. Yeah. What

203
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:58,350
do you make of the endless obsession with
Israel that something like 47 over the

204
00:11:58,351 --> 00:12:03,010
last 51 resolutions are against Israel
and usually usually voted on by countries.

205
00:12:03,011 --> 00:12:03,580
I'm sorry.

206
00:12:03,580 --> 00:12:05,740
That alone is a reason to dissolve the UN.

207
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:08,680
I mean what a lack of moral compass,

208
00:12:09,260 --> 00:12:14,260
what an utter bankruptcy of the morality
that there are nations in the world

209
00:12:15,431 --> 00:12:17,770
that actually still have slavery going on.

210
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:23,400
Slavery where we're basic human rights
for individuals are not guaranteed based

211
00:12:25,241 --> 00:12:29,410
upon sex based upon lifestyle choices.

212
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:34,630
And you're going to lambaste Israel, the
only real democracy in the Middle East.

213
00:12:36,070 --> 00:12:37,300
Yeah,
I say I think you nailed it.

214
00:12:37,301 --> 00:12:42,301
I mean that that in and of itself is a
reason enough to question the future of

215
00:12:42,431 --> 00:12:43,170
the UN.

216
00:12:43,170 --> 00:12:47,550
So is the u s sort of in an odd position
where it's like if we don't do anything,

217
00:12:47,551 --> 00:12:49,260
nothing can get done sort of.

218
00:12:49,261 --> 00:12:53,340
And that that then puts us endlessly
in these quagmires or at least in these

219
00:12:53,341 --> 00:12:57,270
positions where we can either watch the
world burn or get involved in things

220
00:12:57,271 --> 00:13:01,170
where we may end up adding to the burning
in the first place. Like for example,

221
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:05,610
you know with Russia going into Crimea,
they gave up their weapons, right?

222
00:13:05,611 --> 00:13:06,930
They gave up the weapons and they said,
all right,

223
00:13:06,931 --> 00:13:08,220
NATO is going to take care of us,

224
00:13:08,430 --> 00:13:11,820
but what that really means is the United
States is going to take care of you,

225
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,640
and I'm not saying we should have
gone in and done anything there,

226
00:13:14,910 --> 00:13:19,410
but that we're in this endless situation
now where it is either us there,

227
00:13:19,420 --> 00:13:21,120
there is no international fighting.

228
00:13:22,020 --> 00:13:26,070
When I was super careful not to
get caught in a binary dichotomy,

229
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:32,360
you can absolutely say a world without
American leadership is a more dangerous

230
00:13:32,521 --> 00:13:34,950
world because it was for
the last day is look,

231
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:38,430
I mean we had a government that actually
said, we're going to lead from behind,

232
00:13:38,431 --> 00:13:40,920
which is an oxymoron.
You cannot lead from behind.

233
00:13:41,250 --> 00:13:42,930
We're going to have strategic patients,

234
00:13:42,931 --> 00:13:47,580
which means we do nothing and
allow others to act. What happened?

235
00:13:48,270 --> 00:13:53,270
You name it from China building fake
mandatory basis on fake islands to isis,

236
00:13:53,281 --> 00:13:56,130
to Russia invading.
It was just a disaster.

237
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:59,210
We back the guy, then we got my
other guys, then we backed off there.

238
00:14:00,260 --> 00:14:04,780
So yeah, to say that a welder on record
leadership is, is more dangerous,

239
00:14:05,380 --> 00:14:09,880
is true, but that doesn't mean that we
have to fix everybody's problem and nuts.

240
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:13,870
That's where smart strategy
comes in where you say, look,

241
00:14:13,871 --> 00:14:18,871
we have a moral duty to
espouse certain values,

242
00:14:19,450 --> 00:14:23,890
but that doesn't mean we are responsible
for all human beings. Because,

243
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:27,270
because the American revolution
says the opposite, right?

244
00:14:27,430 --> 00:14:31,330
Each nation is responsible,
the citizens are responsible.

245
00:14:31,510 --> 00:14:32,710
If you don't like your system,

246
00:14:32,950 --> 00:14:37,630
do something about it because guess what
we did against the most powerful empire

247
00:14:37,631 --> 00:14:40,150
in the world. So, um, again,

248
00:14:40,270 --> 00:14:44,350
it's about finding that happy medium
in the middle and being smart about it.

249
00:14:44,470 --> 00:14:48,970
And again, we're not being
callous, being realistic,

250
00:14:49,350 --> 00:14:53,570
right? There are atrocities everywhere
from Orlando to t three Yugoslavia,

251
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:57,500
Father American taxpayers are
gonna pay for fixing all of them.

252
00:14:58,520 --> 00:15:02,780
Are we responsible? Are they responsible
for what's happening in their country?

253
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:07,060
Sure are the times when we
could perhaps help them. Uh Huh.

254
00:15:07,790 --> 00:15:08,780
But it's a balance right,

255
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:12,430
to balance. All right, so let's shift
back to your book. So defeating Jihad,

256
00:15:12,460 --> 00:15:13,750
it seems to me that the,

257
00:15:14,540 --> 00:15:18,320
the main sort of narrative on
this is not that we can defeat it,

258
00:15:18,321 --> 00:15:19,580
but we should live with it.

259
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:22,790
That there's a degree of it
with which we should just live,

260
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:27,320
which is don't carry knives
in London and it's, you know,

261
00:15:27,321 --> 00:15:30,500
we're going to put up more barricades
so the trucks can't be driven into

262
00:15:30,501 --> 00:15:34,190
buildings or into shopping centers or
just down the street and killing people

263
00:15:34,460 --> 00:15:38,660
that we can't really defeat this ideology.
We just have to manage it.

264
00:15:39,020 --> 00:15:41,780
I suspect you do not agree
with that premise. Oh,

265
00:15:41,870 --> 00:15:45,110
because we've defeated ideologists before.
You can't look,

266
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:48,770
there are idiots who run around
with swats grand bands today.

267
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:51,020
I get it.
So Nazi-ism hasn't disappeared,

268
00:15:51,350 --> 00:15:54,170
but we have made it so enough of that.

269
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:56,990
If you walk down the
street with a Nazi flag,

270
00:15:57,200 --> 00:16:02,180
you will be rejected by society instantly.
The same thing with the KKK, right?

271
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:06,290
Saudi not with Che Guevara for the
hammer and sickle, right, right, right.

272
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:10,850
But there are ways to defeat ideologies
or to put them in a box where they're

273
00:16:10,851 --> 00:16:14,060
laughable and everybody shuns them.

274
00:16:14,390 --> 00:16:17,510
We have to do the same thing with
jihadism. This is my argument.

275
00:16:17,511 --> 00:16:19,040
This is the conclusion of the book.

276
00:16:19,190 --> 00:16:24,190
We have to be as effective in dealer
[inaudible] the message of GF because very

277
00:16:24,351 --> 00:16:28,310
simply put killing jihadis is great,
but at the end of the day, uh,

278
00:16:28,390 --> 00:16:32,540
body bags as a metric, not a good
metric. It didn't work in Vietnam.

279
00:16:32,570 --> 00:16:34,070
Doesn't work today because guess what?

280
00:16:34,071 --> 00:16:37,580
If you've got a recruiting pool that's
massive, not just recruit new jihadis.

281
00:16:37,940 --> 00:16:42,260
So what's your victory
condition of victory condition
is when the life style of

282
00:16:42,261 --> 00:16:47,261
jihad is no longer sexy from
Brussels to San Bernardino.

283
00:16:47,630 --> 00:16:50,120
How do you do that?
You make a laughingstock.

284
00:16:50,130 --> 00:16:54,710
You discredit that value
system. We're not asked. I mean,

285
00:16:54,830 --> 00:16:59,210
white skinned Catholic isn't going to
do it right? But we help President Sisi,

286
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:03,940
we help King Abdullah of Jordan will
help MBS in Saudi Arabia. I mean, MBS,

287
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:06,170
the historic things he said,

288
00:17:06,620 --> 00:17:10,640
I mean massive about Israel in just the
last few weeks. Yeah. That's how we win.

289
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:14,740
Because sooner or later
enough people say, Eh, uh,

290
00:17:14,820 --> 00:17:17,370
those guys are losers.
That's how we win. Yeah.

291
00:17:17,540 --> 00:17:19,760
But you only do that if you get
to talk about it. Truthfully.

292
00:17:19,761 --> 00:17:22,820
You've gotta be able to talk
about the Koran, what Jihad means,

293
00:17:22,970 --> 00:17:25,670
the history of the religion. Because
if you can't talk about it, honestly,

294
00:17:25,671 --> 00:17:27,470
you're never going to treat it accurately.
Yeah.

295
00:17:27,590 --> 00:17:32,300
We're not very good at that though. Well,
thanks. Political correctness, right?

296
00:17:32,550 --> 00:17:33,480
I mean, imagine if you know, you're,

297
00:17:33,481 --> 00:17:38,150
you're a doctor and you've got a
patient that comes in with third stage

298
00:17:38,630 --> 00:17:42,680
lymphoma, but your hospital
administrator, because it's a scary word,

299
00:17:42,681 --> 00:17:46,100
has banned the use of the word cancer.
You can't say it right.

300
00:17:46,101 --> 00:17:50,160
It's just not allowed. Yeah. And then
you have to tell the patient what, well,

301
00:17:50,161 --> 00:17:53,280
you know, you're dehydrated. Go home,
drink some water and take some aspirin.

302
00:17:53,340 --> 00:17:56,220
What happens? You patient,
they die. It's the same thing.

303
00:17:56,221 --> 00:17:59,520
If you can't diagnose a geo
strategical issue accurately,

304
00:17:59,970 --> 00:18:03,150
however much money you throw at it,
you will not solve the problem.

305
00:18:03,450 --> 00:18:07,200
So are you concerned at all that just
even if it's purely because of the way the

306
00:18:07,201 --> 00:18:08,340
media frames things,

307
00:18:08,341 --> 00:18:13,320
that perhaps Trump is not the right
person to lead the fight against this,

308
00:18:13,321 --> 00:18:14,610
that for whatever,

309
00:18:15,090 --> 00:18:19,860
whatever he's going to say about Jihad
or a radical Islamic terrorism or the

310
00:18:19,861 --> 00:18:20,620
rest,

311
00:18:20,620 --> 00:18:24,360
even if he said everything the exact way
that you wanted it to be said cleanly

312
00:18:24,361 --> 00:18:27,480
and clearly and correctly
defined and all of that,

313
00:18:28,290 --> 00:18:32,040
that he may not be the right messenger
on this just because of the filter it has

314
00:18:32,041 --> 00:18:33,990
to get through to get to reality.

315
00:18:34,290 --> 00:18:38,580
He's not the right messenger domestically
because of what political correctness

316
00:18:38,581 --> 00:18:40,020
is wrought in our country.

317
00:18:40,350 --> 00:18:44,190
But he is absolutely the right
messenger internationally.

318
00:18:44,610 --> 00:18:49,140
Watch the video of his Riyadh speech.
Don't watch him.

319
00:18:49,470 --> 00:18:54,060
Watch the 53 Mosley matter of heads of
state and the body language because man

320
00:18:54,061 --> 00:18:55,650
did he guys,

321
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:59,340
you got a problem and your master and
your society's extremes that you have to

322
00:18:59,341 --> 00:18:59,761
deal with it.

323
00:18:59,761 --> 00:19:03,390
It was tough and you'd thing that'd
be all negative and arms crossed.

324
00:19:04,110 --> 00:19:06,210
They were beaming.
Right.

325
00:19:06,570 --> 00:19:11,570
Cc Abdulla we're going over finally find
a guy who understands our problem and

326
00:19:12,540 --> 00:19:14,850
what is giving us tough love.
So yeah,

327
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:18,300
he is absolutely the right guy
to fix this internationally,

328
00:19:18,301 --> 00:19:20,610
which is where it needs
to be fixed domestically.

329
00:19:20,630 --> 00:19:25,440
Now the political correctness things going
to get in the way, the media insanity.

330
00:19:25,740 --> 00:19:29,640
So do you think he has more support from
foreign heads of state and then we'll

331
00:19:29,641 --> 00:19:30,300
ever have a sense.

332
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:33,600
I mean even if the g eight there was a
feeling of like that actually these guys

333
00:19:33,601 --> 00:19:36,970
kinda liked him or I can tell you,
yeah,

334
00:19:37,620 --> 00:19:41,280
I told people before the inauguration,
you have no idea.

335
00:19:41,310 --> 00:19:42,360
Even if you voted for him,

336
00:19:42,780 --> 00:19:47,700
you have no idea how successful he
will be internationally because he's a

337
00:19:47,701 --> 00:19:51,840
straight shooter and
because he's an Alpha dog.

338
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:56,070
And guess what?
In a lot of places outside of Berkeley,

339
00:19:57,090 --> 00:19:59,490
they like have that right,

340
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:02,220
because they know what
you're talking about.

341
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:07,020
They don't have to walk on eggshells.
They understand your direction. So, yeah,

342
00:20:07,230 --> 00:20:08,250
internationally,

343
00:20:08,850 --> 00:20:13,220
our prestige as a nation
has skyrocketed in,

344
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:17,160
you know, outside of the European
Union and maybe, you know,

345
00:20:17,161 --> 00:20:20,040
certain century pin countries
exempted. Yeah, absolutely.

346
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:22,920
So I know we could do a whole
other show on this, but,

347
00:20:22,921 --> 00:20:25,980
but very quickly just
on Russia and collusion,

348
00:20:25,981 --> 00:20:28,020
as someone that has been
around the administration,

349
00:20:28,021 --> 00:20:31,170
you've mentioned some of these people
already, Flynn, you know, down the road.

350
00:20:32,670 --> 00:20:35,850
What can you tell me about that and is
there anything that people should be

351
00:20:35,851 --> 00:20:39,000
worried about or do you think this is
all gonna actually points us back to the

352
00:20:39,001 --> 00:20:42,240
Democrats, which every time it seems,
every time it seems to point to Trump,

353
00:20:42,510 --> 00:20:44,820
you go a little bit further and then
you're going, oh whoa, wait a minute.

354
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:47,980
That was actually the Democrats
doing my good friend has a,

355
00:20:47,981 --> 00:20:49,430
the best morning show in DC,

356
00:20:49,570 --> 00:20:53,530
a m Chris plot of the radio host is
actually a national syndicated now.

357
00:20:53,890 --> 00:20:56,340
And I have to credit him with this.
He says it's the,

358
00:20:56,341 --> 00:21:00,970
it's the last scene from the hunt for
Red October when the bad captain Tupelo

359
00:21:01,150 --> 00:21:05,830
launches the, the, the torpedoes against,
you know, Sean Connery on the radio,

360
00:21:05,831 --> 00:21:08,980
Toba and he takes the fuses
off and then what happens?

361
00:21:08,981 --> 00:21:13,240
Remember his Xo says you
killed off the thing,

362
00:21:13,241 --> 00:21:18,190
comes back and syncs them. This is the
most hilarious boomerang in history,

363
00:21:18,370 --> 00:21:20,890
right? I'll tell you what the
president told me in the Oval Office,

364
00:21:20,891 --> 00:21:22,870
just the two of us.
It was very frustrating.

365
00:21:22,871 --> 00:21:26,500
One day I think maybe Jared had
just testified or given his speech,

366
00:21:26,770 --> 00:21:28,420
his little press conference,
and he said,

367
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:33,760
they will not find anything
because there is nothing,

368
00:21:34,420 --> 00:21:37,780
and you know what? I take that to the
bank. There is no Russian collusion.

369
00:21:37,930 --> 00:21:42,930
How could there be off for the last 15
months from arming the Ukrainians to the

370
00:21:44,561 --> 00:21:48,610
XL pipeline to Anwar to finally,
after 30 years,

371
00:21:48,611 --> 00:21:53,611
the first present to ever get NATO to
finally stump up the 2% of GDP that they

372
00:21:53,921 --> 00:21:58,000
promised they'd spend on defense to
our own military expenditure increases.

373
00:21:58,180 --> 00:22:01,960
Every significant policy decision as
president has taken with regards to Russia

374
00:22:02,110 --> 00:22:04,990
has been bad for that former KGB colonel.

375
00:22:05,350 --> 00:22:07,360
So the idea that with colluding,

376
00:22:07,540 --> 00:22:12,540
you have to be on drugs or be so
ideologically blind to believe that,

377
00:22:14,620 --> 00:22:18,310
well then what do we do with this? This
layer, you know, whatever that you,

378
00:22:18,311 --> 00:22:22,810
you've referenced deep state before
[inaudible] what do we do with this thing?

379
00:22:22,811 --> 00:22:26,140
You know the look,
we have an ongoing investigation to me,

380
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:27,380
the Mueller and get investigated.

381
00:22:27,390 --> 00:22:30,430
What seems odd to me is that
I don't know what the actual,

382
00:22:30,580 --> 00:22:33,430
I don't know that they ever laid out
with their mission is other than to find

383
00:22:33,431 --> 00:22:35,170
something, what was the crime? Right?

384
00:22:35,171 --> 00:22:40,171
And so the illusion to commit to
collusion to conspire in a crime.

385
00:22:41,890 --> 00:22:44,050
Okay,
but what's the crime?

386
00:22:44,410 --> 00:22:49,410
Because if it's Russia misrepresenting
itself or perverting the truth on

387
00:22:50,741 --> 00:22:51,610
Facebook,

388
00:22:52,750 --> 00:22:57,580
well then Zuckerberg should be
right charged then, then you know,

389
00:22:57,581 --> 00:23:00,220
Anderson Cooper should be in the doc.

390
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:07,320
What are the charges that have been
brought outrageously ridiculous lying to

391
00:23:07,601 --> 00:23:10,570
federal investigators?
You,

392
00:23:10,810 --> 00:23:15,010
you would probably be able to be
caught in a perjury trap today. Okay.

393
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:17,590
Because not everybody remembers
what they did and how they did it.

394
00:23:17,770 --> 00:23:21,820
Perjury traps about what you said to
somebody Irri irrespective of Russia.

395
00:23:22,150 --> 00:23:24,130
That's not Donald Trump's problem.

396
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:29,520
Why a fraud eight years ago when Manafort
worked for the Ukrainian president,

397
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:34,570
what's that got to do with
Russian collusion? Nothing.

398
00:23:34,900 --> 00:23:38,410
My worry is that Mueller
is not a good actor.

399
00:23:38,830 --> 00:23:39,970
If you look at who is hired,

400
00:23:39,971 --> 00:23:44,971
it's clear that there's massive buyers
and this report he's writing for Congress

401
00:23:46,250 --> 00:23:51,250
is simply going to be a political weapon
in the elections and that's not how

402
00:23:51,471 --> 00:23:54,380
justice is served.
That's not rule of law.

403
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:59,150
That's a law enforcement official
getting involved in politics,

404
00:23:59,180 --> 00:24:01,820
so that's what I'm concerned about.
Also whether,

405
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:04,310
whether you think something for the
people that are watching this that thinks

406
00:24:04,311 --> 00:24:05,360
something happened or didn't happen.

407
00:24:05,361 --> 00:24:08,660
What I'm more concerned about is that
we're entering this new phase where

408
00:24:08,661 --> 00:24:11,570
whether it's Trump that's president or
it's a Democrat that's president or it's

409
00:24:11,571 --> 00:24:12,890
a different republican or whatever,

410
00:24:13,100 --> 00:24:16,850
that we're just going to endlessly also
have this layer that all it does is

411
00:24:16,851 --> 00:24:19,460
investigate itself, waste money. You know,

412
00:24:19,461 --> 00:24:23,720
just constantly just be keeping us all
in this state where we never know what's

413
00:24:23,721 --> 00:24:27,680
real. Because if you listen to
half of the pundits on television,

414
00:24:27,681 --> 00:24:32,000
I mean their implication is that
Russia has installed our president,

415
00:24:32,001 --> 00:24:35,540
in which case that's probably the single
biggest active board and the history of

416
00:24:35,541 --> 00:24:37,580
the world.
And what are you actually saying?

417
00:24:37,581 --> 00:24:41,270
Do we take Trump out and then do you take
out pants and now should Paul, right?

418
00:24:41,310 --> 00:24:44,990
Have you taken to its logical conclusion
or do we have Paul Ryan as what are

419
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,990
your resident then and w right?
Where are you really taking this?

420
00:24:48,140 --> 00:24:51,140
And that's what I'm worried about is
that we're just going to end up in this

421
00:24:51,380 --> 00:24:52,550
constant state where yes,

422
00:24:52,551 --> 00:24:54,370
we'll have a democrat and
then a republican or whatever,

423
00:24:54,530 --> 00:24:58,520
but we'll really be caught in just con
all government can do is investigate

424
00:24:58,521 --> 00:25:03,520
itself really more than anything else.
I didn't see myself as an optimist,

425
00:25:03,521 --> 00:25:05,950
but you're giving me a real
challenge with that last one.

426
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:09,430
I see myself as an optimist too,
but I think, um, I'm a realist.

427
00:25:09,431 --> 00:25:11,100
So for months and months,
a month,

428
00:25:11,130 --> 00:25:14,070
it's all refuse to use the phrase deep
state. I really thought that was a,

429
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:15,540
you know, 10 fold, Hattie kind of thing

430
00:25:16,350 --> 00:25:16,971
and one of the record,

431
00:25:16,971 --> 00:25:18,940
I don't even know that I've
even said it once on this show.

432
00:25:19,020 --> 00:25:20,670
It sort of pops up and answer.

433
00:25:21,220 --> 00:25:23,740
I use it now because I've seen it,

434
00:25:24,430 --> 00:25:26,500
I've seen it inside the administration.

435
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:31,330
When you go to enough National Security
Council meetings that are classified,

436
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:34,200
that is the, the, the,

437
00:25:34,210 --> 00:25:38,530
the pinnacle of policy making in
America outside of the Oval Office.

438
00:25:38,531 --> 00:25:41,920
And this is where policy's made.
Everybody's in the room from the NSC.

439
00:25:42,070 --> 00:25:46,240
Then you've got the outstations
on secure VTC from Dia, uh,

440
00:25:46,310 --> 00:25:49,390
chair of the joint chiefs,
CIA state, you name it, right?

441
00:25:49,750 --> 00:25:53,000
And you sit there as a newly appointed
political, and you're next to,

442
00:25:53,001 --> 00:25:56,890
for two hours on a big issue,
isis, Russia, whatever it is.

443
00:25:58,120 --> 00:26:03,120
And not one participant mentions the
name of the president or what he said

444
00:26:05,231 --> 00:26:10,060
yesterday in Warsaw or what his
objective is, given that specific issue.

445
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:12,850
And you see this happen
again and again and again.

446
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,910
And you're the guy at the
end of the conversation with
the funny accent and says,

447
00:26:15,970 --> 00:26:20,530
excuse me, ladies and gentlemen, you do
know what the president said about X.

448
00:26:20,620 --> 00:26:24,010
Yes, today. Can we actually do that?

449
00:26:24,460 --> 00:26:28,660
The deep state is real when you've got
gs fifteens and ses is saying, well,

450
00:26:29,050 --> 00:26:32,650
I've been here for 20 years.
I know this guy's gonna be here for four.

451
00:26:32,710 --> 00:26:35,830
I know better. That's bad for
democracy. So to be clearly,

452
00:26:35,860 --> 00:26:39,250
you don't think it's some sort of
massive underground conspiracy.

453
00:26:39,251 --> 00:26:44,030
You think it's just the apparatus, the,
it's just the old Washington apparatus. I

454
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:47,640
don't think you have these people who
think Obama is sitting in a cave somewhere

455
00:26:47,641 --> 00:26:51,750
with a joystick. He's lazy. He never be
a monster. My, he's not specter, right?

456
00:26:51,751 --> 00:26:53,490
It's not Blofeld but,

457
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:57,680
but know that there's a culture in
government that's antithetical to an

458
00:26:57,681 --> 00:27:01,500
undermining, undermining the
president on a daily basis.

459
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:05,580
But, but there is, there is concerted
effort in the media. Oh my gosh.

460
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:10,200
I mean Ben Rhodes brags about Ai.
That guy's unbelievable. But he says,

461
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:15,390
my buddies, the left wing journalists
are morons. And then my echo chamber,

462
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:19,260
he,
he built this machine that was,

463
00:27:19,261 --> 00:27:23,070
was this incestuous connection
between people in the West Wing,

464
00:27:23,310 --> 00:27:26,670
people in the think tank community
and their bodies in the media. I mean,

465
00:27:26,700 --> 00:27:29,220
look at the attack pieces on anybody,
me or whatever.

466
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:32,310
It's very interesting that somebody
should do a case study agendas in school.

467
00:27:32,490 --> 00:27:36,720
One attack piece will drop at 7:00
AM by two o'clock in the afternoon,

468
00:27:36,750 --> 00:27:41,070
30 have been written, which are simply
cut and paste. But if you don't know that,

469
00:27:41,100 --> 00:27:44,250
it looks as, oh my gosh,
go cause a fascist. No.

470
00:27:44,310 --> 00:27:47,700
It's one guy's article that was written
because Ben Rhodes told them to ride it.

471
00:27:47,910 --> 00:27:52,140
The Co comes and multiplies on the right.
How do we react?

472
00:27:53,100 --> 00:27:56,610
Well, I got my own pet
international review this month,

473
00:27:59,730 --> 00:28:00,563
right.

474
00:28:01,410 --> 00:28:05,490
There's a Gulf in terms
of managing narrative.

475
00:28:05,910 --> 00:28:10,910
The left built built a whole ecosystem
and we're still in the 1980s you know,

476
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:13,110
oh we'll take out a full
page ad in the Washington.

477
00:28:14,550 --> 00:28:17,010
Well that's why when
discussing, right. Yeah.

478
00:28:17,011 --> 00:28:20,490
I think it's so important to not or I
think most people especially just because

479
00:28:20,491 --> 00:28:21,480
of the way social media works,

480
00:28:21,690 --> 00:28:25,500
they immediately go to the
full on conspiracy of Obama
with a joy stick or just

481
00:28:25,501 --> 00:28:26,370
some other ver,

482
00:28:26,510 --> 00:28:30,510
you know the globalist thing and this
whole where to me it's like they're there.

483
00:28:30,750 --> 00:28:34,440
What you just described seems more
realistic to me that there's an apparatus

484
00:28:34,441 --> 00:28:39,441
there that then is still connected
to the idea that seems we can,

485
00:28:39,781 --> 00:28:44,360
we can discuss that in a sensible
way with one addition and, and I,

486
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:49,640
I appreciate this not having been in
the target has in the cross hairs for so

487
00:28:50,071 --> 00:28:50,904
long.

488
00:28:51,990 --> 00:28:56,940
They have an advantage because our
side is predicated on what David,

489
00:28:57,600 --> 00:29:01,440
the individual manifest destiny,
the rugged individualism.

490
00:29:01,590 --> 00:29:06,090
We believe in individual. The left by
definition is a collective entity. I mean,

491
00:29:06,450 --> 00:29:10,140
there are elements of the bog in the left,
and it is a,

492
00:29:10,141 --> 00:29:14,130
it truly is a collective,
collective mob mentality.

493
00:29:14,131 --> 00:29:18,390
A friend of mine on Rafe, you're watching,
I mean, thank you. There is this, when,

494
00:29:18,470 --> 00:29:23,010
when, when, when one guy goes off
to gallcher or Bannon or whoever,

495
00:29:23,011 --> 00:29:27,360
the president, there's this
massive collective pylon sort
of conspiracy. Yeah. But,

496
00:29:27,450 --> 00:29:29,970
but it's a color.
They're all on the same hymn sheet.

497
00:29:30,930 --> 00:29:35,660
They don't need direction whether say,
Oh yeah, let's go off to him, which is,

498
00:29:35,700 --> 00:29:37,680
which puts us on the right
at a disadvantage. Yeah.

499
00:29:37,681 --> 00:29:40,920
So this is just sort of an emergent group
thing. It's be of the cultural thing.

500
00:29:41,230 --> 00:29:42,063
Yeah.
Yeah.

501
00:29:42,220 --> 00:29:45,940
Wow. We could do, we're going to do this
again. Oh, so this is so much fun. Yeah.

502
00:29:46,030 --> 00:29:49,890
This was an absolute pleasure,
uh, for more on Dr Gorka.

503
00:29:49,900 --> 00:29:54,340
Can I feel like I have to say, I know,
well, I'll call you. I would if I'm a pro,

504
00:29:54,341 --> 00:29:58,030
when I'm doing that later, I'll call you
Sebastian, but I feel like doctor Gorka,

505
00:29:58,120 --> 00:30:00,490
I mean, you shouldn't be a star
wars character. It's all in there.

506
00:30:00,670 --> 00:30:05,170
For more on Sebastian, follow him
on Twitter. It's at Seb Gorka.
