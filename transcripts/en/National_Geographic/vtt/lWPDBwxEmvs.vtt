00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:02.433
Ever wondered
how wildlife crews

00:00:02.433 --> 00:00:05.333
managed to capture
the perfect shot right

00:00:05.333 --> 00:00:06.567
in the heart of the action?

00:00:06.567 --> 00:00:08.734
Check out the behind
the scenes to see

00:00:08.734 --> 00:00:11.166
the great lengths
that the crew went

00:00:11.166 --> 00:00:14.967
to to film "Hostile Planet."

00:00:14.967 --> 00:00:16.467
MATT RICHARDS: Rock
copper penguins

00:00:16.467 --> 00:00:20.433
live in cold, quiet
often brutal conditions.

00:00:20.433 --> 00:00:22.100
It's a pretty tough
location to get to.

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:23.400
It's very remote.

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:26.533
It's quite near Antarctica.

00:00:26.533 --> 00:00:31.367
We left about a month,
so it was a long trip.

00:00:31.367 --> 00:00:33.800
And so we really got
to spend a lot of time

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:35.533
with those penguins.

00:00:35.533 --> 00:00:37.533
ANTHONY PYPER: The
best thing for us

00:00:37.533 --> 00:00:41.567
is to be noticed by the
species we're filming

00:00:41.567 --> 00:00:44.633
and get them completely
used to us being there

00:00:44.633 --> 00:00:46.900
so we're just part
of the furniture.

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:50.000
MATT RICHARDS: We were filming
where the penguins were

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.767
coming onto shore, essentially
it was a sort of boulder field.

00:00:54.767 --> 00:00:58.467
It's covered in a thin film of
guano, which is fine when it's

00:00:58.467 --> 00:01:01.033
dry but the second you get
any moisture it essentially

00:01:01.033 --> 00:01:02.900
becomes like walking on ice.

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:06.367
PETE CAYLISS: It's sunset here
on New Islands in the Falklands

00:01:06.367 --> 00:01:08.867
and I've just been
waiting for penguins

00:01:08.867 --> 00:01:10.900
to return from the sea.

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:13.500
The bit I'm actually trying
to film at the moment

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:17.934
is where they explode from
the water onto the dry land.

00:01:17.934 --> 00:01:22.166
And to do this, I'm using
a high speed filming rig.

00:01:22.166 --> 00:01:24.300
I want to time it exactly right.

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:27.133
And you get barely
any warning at all.

00:01:27.133 --> 00:01:29.433
[chirping]

00:01:29.433 --> 00:01:31.533
MATT RICHARDS: What's
on the agenda today?

00:01:31.533 --> 00:01:36.133
Today we are taking
the giant homemade crane

00:01:36.133 --> 00:01:39.033
right down to the penguins.

00:01:39.033 --> 00:01:41.333
It's just what we
call a pole cam,

00:01:41.333 --> 00:01:44.367
but a sort of enormous
version of that.

00:01:44.367 --> 00:01:45.900
Really, the whole
point of the crane

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:49.467
is to have a camera at the
end and us as far as possible.

00:01:49.467 --> 00:01:51.700
So here's the business
end of the crane.

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:54.300
So far it looks good,
so we'll give it a go.

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:57.734
[music playing]

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:02.266
Ultimately, we were
trying to capture

00:02:02.266 --> 00:02:06.100
how difficult it was for a
penguin to feed its chicks.

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:09.633
We wanted to see how they coped
in really hostile conditions.

00:02:09.633 --> 00:02:12.800
And we got lucky because
we got the biggest

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:16.000
storm in the Falklands that
they'd had for 30 years.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:17.300
It was pretty scary, actually.

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:19.900
So the storm has kicked
in and the penguins

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:21.934
are still coming in.

00:02:21.934 --> 00:02:25.133
Those 80 mile an hour winds,
the waves were getting bigger.

00:02:25.133 --> 00:02:27.967
Bit too windy for the drone?

00:02:27.967 --> 00:02:30.600
It's a bit windy.

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:32.533
We didn't know how
far these waves were

00:02:32.533 --> 00:02:33.934
going to come up the shore.

00:02:33.934 --> 00:02:36.834
We were playing this fine
gambling game where you

00:02:36.834 --> 00:02:39.200
definitely wanted to be safe
but you wanted to try and get

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:41.266
that immersive feel of
what it's like to be

00:02:41.266 --> 00:02:43.333
a penguin coming in a storm.

00:02:46.533 --> 00:02:49.266
The thing that really stands
out is how well these animals

00:02:49.266 --> 00:02:51.567
can cope with some of the
most hostile conditions you

00:02:51.567 --> 00:02:52.967
can imagine.

00:02:52.967 --> 00:02:55.166
Every time you come back from a
shift you have fresh admiration

00:02:55.166 --> 00:02:56.834
for these amazing animals.

00:02:56.834 --> 00:02:58.867
