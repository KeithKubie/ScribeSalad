00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:04.019
My name is Aaron Karp and now
I'll be walking you through

00:00:04.019 --> 00:00:08.230
changes that we are making to
campaign targeting in v201109.

00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:10.270
So first, I'm going to talk
about the difference between

00:00:10.270 --> 00:00:13.440
v201109 and v201101.

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:15.830
I'm gonna show you guys some
examples of what it looks like

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:18.620
in the old version and what it
looks like in the new version.

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:20.810
And then I'm gonna discuss a
couple of helper services that

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:24.450
we're also releasing that make
it easier to get different

00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:27.320
campaign target types back from
the API so you don't have

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:30.270
to rely on the tables and
the documentation.

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:33.230
Similarly to how we were talking
about report fields

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:36.430
being available by API service,
now many of the

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:38.620
geo-targets, for example,
are available by

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:39.970
API service, as well.

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:42.990
Here's how things looked
in v201101.

00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:48.680
At the campaign level within the
settings property, you had

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:51.890
Geo-target Type, Real Time
Bidding Settings.

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:54.500
You had these networks settings
about Google Search,

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:58.370
Google Search Network, Contact
Network, Contact Contextual,

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:00.810
Partner Search Network,
that sort of thing.

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:03.560
Within the campaign target
services, you have the Ad

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:05.710
Schedule Target, Language
Target, Platform Target,

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:08.650
Mobile Target, Geo Target,
and Demographic Target.

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:10.650
Here's what's happening
in v201109.

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:12.930
So all that's left on the
campaign target surface is the

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:14.250
Ad Schedule Target.

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.520
Language Target, Platform
Target, Mobile Target, Geo

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:18.390
Target, Demographic Target--

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:19.310
all gone.

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:21.930
Where did they go?

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:24.170
To the Campaign Criterion
Service.

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:28.340
What we're doing is we are
starting to treat all of these

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:31.000
different targeting parameters
the same way that we treat

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:32.340
keywords and placements--

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:36.960
as just another way of
determining who sees your ad.

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:41.600
Just like the keyword search
term helps identify a person

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:46.140
to show your ad to, same thing
with gender, or age range, or

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:47.520
mobile operating system.

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:50.220
Those are all criteria that
determine whether or not

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:53.180
someone is a good candidate
to see your ad and

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:54.915
possibly click through.

00:01:54.915 --> 00:01:59.300
So here's a quick mapping
looking at the way things were

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:03.205
previously, the Ad Schedule
Target, the Country Target,

00:02:03.205 --> 00:02:04.670
Mobile Platform Target.

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:09.100
We've moved them into this
criteria categorization.

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:11.200
For the most part, it's a
one-to-one mapping with the

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:14.880
exception of Geo Target, where
you can see city, country,

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:19.400
metro, province, et cetera, all
get moved into the same

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:21.520
location, criterion side.

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:24.690
In the process of moving our
targeting types into the

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:30.380
campaign criterion service, we
needed to have criterion ideas

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:33.540
for all these new
targeting types.

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:37.550
So looking at platform targets,
for example, we have

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:40.020
these three platform targeting
criteria--

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:42.352
desktop, high-end mobile,
and tablet.

00:02:42.352 --> 00:02:45.010
What you'll notice is
interesting is that they have

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:49.760
unique, static criteria ID
values because there's only

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:53.230
one row in our criteria table
representing each of those

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:54.700
platform target types.

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:57.790
So let's look at a
response from the

00:02:57.790 --> 00:02:59.410
campaign target service.

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:05.310
In v201101, if you did a
campaign target service .get

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:08.320
in the previous version, and
you were looking at the

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:10.580
language targets, you
might see what we

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:11.350
have at the top here.

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:13.540
Target type is language
target.

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:16.154
Language code is English.

00:03:16.154 --> 00:03:20.750
In v201109, we're gonna do
campaign criterion service

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:26.170
.get, and we're gonna get back
an array of criteria objects.

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:29.160
Here we have criterion
xsi type is language.

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:32.220
It has that idea of 1,000, which
you'll remember from the

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:34.320
previous slide identifies
it as English.

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:40.150
We also have the code here, EN,
for the language, and some

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:41.940
other data to help you out.

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:46.780
Note that when you send this
XML to the API in order to

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:49.480
create a new criterion, you
don't actually have to send

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:50.790
the vast majority
of these fields.

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:53.470
All you really have to send is
the xsi type and the ID.

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:55.080
Let's look at one more example,
this time with

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:57.210
geo-targeting.

00:03:57.210 --> 00:04:00.400
In the previous version of the
API, you would receive the

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:03.440
following target for
a province target.

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:05.170
Target type, province target.

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:07.640
Province code, US, Alabama.

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:12.620
In the new campaign criterion
service response, you'll get

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:13.670
the following.

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:15.565
Xsi type is location.

00:04:15.565 --> 00:04:18.339
The ID is 21133.

00:04:18.339 --> 00:04:21.390
And the rest of it is helpful
data that you might want to

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:24.225
have in response but doesn't
necessarily need to be passed

00:04:24.225 --> 00:04:27.880
in by you when you actually
create one of these criteria.

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:30.760
You'll also notice that the
response contains a parent

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:33.340
locations object, our
parent location

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:34.910
elements in the XML here.

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:40.860
And that shows that the parent
of Alabama is 2840, which

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:42.720
corresponds to the
United States.

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:45.700
Let's look at the constant data
service, which, as you

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:49.940
might imagine, returns data
on various constants.

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:52.940
Right now it has two methods,
one of which is get language

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:55.520
criterion, and that's gonna
return an array of all the

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:57.670
different possible language
criteria that you

00:04:57.670 --> 00:04:59.220
might want to target.

00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:01.590
Here's a snippet of
the response.

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:05.515
First we have our English
language target, ID 1,000.

00:05:05.515 --> 00:05:08.890
We have our German language
target, ID 1,001, French,

00:05:08.890 --> 00:05:11.750
1,002, et cetera.

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:15.090
So you can use this instead of
hard coding languages and IDs

00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:16.020
into your application.

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:19.035
If you wanted to refresh this
periodically, or even do it on

00:05:19.035 --> 00:05:22.220
the fly, you have the option
of polling a up-to-the-date

00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:24.620
list that matches exactly
what we have in

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:26.110
AdWords using this service.

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:29.350
We also have another new service
called the location

00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:30.670
criterion service.

00:05:30.670 --> 00:05:35.740
This one is like a search
service for matching different

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:40.000
geographic terms with the
corresponding AdWords objects.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:44.000
In this example here, I'm going
to be searching for a

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:47.255
location using our nice, generic
selector format.

00:05:47.255 --> 00:05:50.760
I'm gonna pass on a predicate
to search for where the

00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:54.670
location name equals this set
of Chinese characters.

00:05:54.670 --> 00:05:57.920
This also serves to show
how this service works

00:05:57.920 --> 00:05:58.970
cross-language.

00:05:58.970 --> 00:06:01.900
So what does the response look
like for this search?

00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:05.245
Those Chinese characters
correspond to the city of

00:06:05.245 --> 00:06:06.680
Beijing in China.

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:11.160
So we get back-- our criterion
type is any location where the

00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:14.570
name is Beijing, display
type city.

00:06:14.570 --> 00:06:16.270
And it also gives us
back the parents.

00:06:16.270 --> 00:06:19.857
So we can tell from this, that
would be city of Beijing is

00:06:19.857 --> 00:06:22.080
within the region of Beijing,
which is within

00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:24.150
the country of China.

00:06:24.150 --> 00:06:27.730
And we can get back the
canonical name as well right

00:06:27.730 --> 00:06:30.870
here, which is Google
canonical localized

00:06:30.870 --> 00:06:34.340
representation of Beijing,
in this case.

00:06:34.340 --> 00:06:34.780
All right.

00:06:34.780 --> 00:06:36.160
Let's look at a little bit
of a code example.

00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:39.590
How would one actually
create one of these

00:06:39.590 --> 00:06:41.430
new campaign criteria?

00:06:41.430 --> 00:06:45.010
In this case, we're going to
create a tablet target, and

00:06:45.010 --> 00:06:48.840
we're going to create a
geo-target for the country of

00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:51.930
Mexico using PHP in this
particular case.

00:06:51.930 --> 00:06:54.690
So we create our new platform
target object.

00:06:54.690 --> 00:06:55.480
We set its ID.

00:06:55.480 --> 00:06:57.666
Now, again, you can pull that
from your database.

00:06:57.666 --> 00:07:00.550
You can pull that from our
ConstantData service.

00:07:00.550 --> 00:07:04.430
Or you can just have it hard
coded in, as well.

00:07:04.430 --> 00:07:07.740
We're gonna create a new
campaign criterion object

00:07:07.740 --> 00:07:08.590
using this ID.

00:07:08.590 --> 00:07:09.770
Pretty simple.

00:07:09.770 --> 00:07:11.380
Then we're gonna do the
same exact thing

00:07:11.380 --> 00:07:12.840
with the country targets.

00:07:12.840 --> 00:07:14.600
A new location object.

00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:18.320
We're going to create a campaign
criterion object that

00:07:18.320 --> 00:07:20.990
encloses that location.

00:07:20.990 --> 00:07:24.800
We're gonna add it to our array
of campaign criteria.

00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:27.820
And then below is what you
guys are already familiar

00:07:27.820 --> 00:07:32.232
with, basically setting the
operator as add and sending it

00:07:32.232 --> 00:07:35.040
to the campaign criterion
service

00:07:35.040 --> 00:07:36.720
with the mutate method.

00:07:36.720 --> 00:07:38.530
So where can you find
these ideas?

00:07:38.530 --> 00:07:41.560
Well, a couple of them
are available in the

00:07:41.560 --> 00:07:43.460
ConstantData service.

00:07:43.460 --> 00:07:47.870
But for everything else, we have
published lists of codes

00:07:47.870 --> 00:07:51.690
down at the very bottom left
of the documentation page

00:07:51.690 --> 00:07:52.540
under system codes.

00:07:52.540 --> 00:07:56.400
You can see here, I have the
age ranges selected.

00:07:56.400 --> 00:08:00.420
So these are the different
criterion IDs for all these

00:08:00.420 --> 00:08:02.880
possible age range targets.

00:08:02.880 --> 00:08:03.365
All right.

00:08:03.365 --> 00:08:04.615
Thank you very much.
