00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:00.550
But before we get started
with today's program

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:04.480
and introduce our speaker, I'd
like to give you a brief overview

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:08.460
for our division and its resources
in the hopes that you'll come back

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:12.530
and use the collections and
this reading for your research.

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:17.250
This is a custodial division which
is comprised of three sections

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:21.860 position:56%
that build and serve the collections
to researchers around the world.

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:27.130
We cover over 75 countries and
more than two dozen languages.

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:30.600
The sub-Sahara Africa section
covers all the countries

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.820

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:35.870
The Hebraic section

and the people of the Caucuses.

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:57.500
So you see it encompasses
a very wide region.

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:00.820
After the program, we would
like to invite you to fill

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:05.230

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:16.500
We would also like to invite
you to ask questions at the end.

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:20.640
But if you do, since
we're being filmed today,

you're giving your permission by
asking those questions to be filmed.

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:28.890
So now I would like to
call upon Hirad Dinavari,

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:32.190
our Iranian World specialist
to introduce our speaker.

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:34.480
Thank you.

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:37.410
&gt;&gt; Hirad Dinavari: Thank you, Joan,
and thank you everyone for coming.

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:41.970 position:56%
I know it's day after holiday and
people are just now getting familiar

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:45.410
with summer and it's in
the middle of the day.

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:49.000
So I realized coming here, is a
can be a little bit about issue

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.300
but I'm very glad to
have everyone here.

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:52.600
I want to take a second

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:56.750
and introduce our wonderful
speaker Ms. Mahnaz Rezaie.

00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:01.300
Mahnaz was born in
Western Afghanistan

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:06.510
and she was raising a family
that valued education immensely

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:09.950
as a child when the Taliban
invasion had started.

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:14.210
She and her family fled not to
return for a number of years.

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:19.120
Eventually, she did go back and
was able to get a scholarship

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:23.630
to continue her education in
the United States in 2005.

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:28.630
Ms. Rezaie is a writer for the
Afghan Women's Writer's Project,

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:31.990

And is now a mentor for the online

She is also a filmmaker who has

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:55.780
and explores how wearing hijab
affected her relationships

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:59.070
when she first came
to the United States.

00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:03.120
And currently, Ms. Rezaie
is in the Master's program

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:05.460

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:07.960

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:30.260 position:56%
At the end of this program, there
is very interesting book essentially

Hearts" in both Persian--

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:37.630
Dari Persian and English.

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:40.940
And Ms. Rezaie would make
this book available for those

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:42.240
of you who are interested.

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:47.920
Without taking any more time, I'm
going to ask Mahnaz to come up here

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:50.010
and give us her wonderful
presentation.

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:51.310
[ Inaudible Remark ]

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:59.820
&gt;&gt; Mahnaz Rezaie: Thank you for the
kind introduction Hirad and Joan.

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:03.090
Hello and welcome everyone,
good afternoon.

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:07.660
It's my pleasure to be here
and thank you all for coming

00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:11.870
to hear the voice of
Afghan women today.

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:15.090
First, I want to explain
a little bit

00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:17.980
about the Afghan Women's
Writing Project.

00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:23.090
Afghan Women's Writing
Project is an online program,

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:24.950
it's an online workshop.

00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:28.000
So I'm going to show
you the website.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:33.730
This is the website for Afghan
Women's Writing Project.

00:05:33.730 --> 00:05:37.840
It started in 2009.

00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:41.420
Then a journalist, her
name is Masha Hamilton,

00:05:41.420 --> 00:05:44.480
the founder of Afghan
Women's Writing Project.

00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:49.920
When she went to Afghanistan after
she saw a woman who got killed

00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:54.750
and shot to death in
[inaudible] in Kabul.

00:05:54.750 --> 00:05:59.210
She was wondering what was
the story behind this woman

00:05:59.210 --> 00:06:04.040
that she had eight children
and she was killed by Taliban.

00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:07.420
And she wanted to know the story
and she went to Afghanistan

00:06:07.420 --> 00:06:10.850
and she researched and
asked about this woman.

00:06:10.850 --> 00:06:13.730
But she didn't find out
the story behind this woman

00:06:13.730 --> 00:06:18.020
and she felt there are many
stories that are being untold

00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:22.020
in Afghanistan especially
women, they don't have a voice.

00:06:22.020 --> 00:06:27.940
So, she started this online project
with five students and she thought

00:06:27.940 --> 00:06:31.860
that she needs to help women
to voice their concerns,

00:06:31.860 --> 00:06:35.960
to write about their day-to-day
life, to write about their stories,

00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:39.520
their sadness, their happiness's.

00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:42.090
So, the workshop started
with five students.

00:06:42.090 --> 00:06:47.880
And right now we have 445 students.

00:06:47.880 --> 00:06:52.250
They started with one
English workshops

00:06:52.250 --> 00:06:55.630
and right now we have
nine English workshops,

00:06:55.630 --> 00:06:58.650
two Dari workshop and
one Pashto workshop.

00:06:58.650 --> 00:07:03.680
In Afghanistan, we have two
official language, one is Pashto

00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:06.440
and the other one is Dari.

00:07:06.440 --> 00:07:10.910
So there are workshops
on the site also.

00:07:10.910 --> 00:07:17.190 position:56%
Afghan Women's Writing Project works
in five provinces in Balkh, Bamyan,

00:07:17.190 --> 00:07:19.450
Ghazni and Herat's and in Kabul.

00:07:19.450 --> 00:07:24.130
And they also have
writers in Kandahar.

00:07:24.130 --> 00:07:30.640
And we have as I said,
445 writers enrolled.

00:07:30.640 --> 00:07:36.970
We had 111 mentors who are
journalist, who are teachers

00:07:36.970 --> 00:07:40.410
around United States and they
are all working voluntarily

00:07:40.410 --> 00:07:42.580 position:56%
with Afghan Women's Writing Project.

00:07:42.580 --> 00:07:44.490
The way the workshop works is

00:07:44.490 --> 00:07:50.750
that students are enrolled
in online workshops.

00:07:50.750 --> 00:07:53.540
They are like Google groups.

00:07:53.540 --> 00:07:58.610
And they send-- The mentors, they
sent weekly prompts like write

00:07:58.610 --> 00:08:05.090
about mother, write about like
what is the value of life for you.

00:08:05.090 --> 00:08:08.190
They give-- They send
weekly prompts to students,

00:08:08.190 --> 00:08:11.200
one or two weekly prompts, and
they ask the student if you don't

00:08:11.200 --> 00:08:14.990
like this prompt, we can
write about other issues.

00:08:14.990 --> 00:08:20.360
And students usually writes
poems, they write short stories

00:08:20.360 --> 00:08:23.790
and they send all articles and
they send to these mentors.

00:08:23.790 --> 00:08:29.840
And the mentors work with them
to help them polish their work

00:08:29.840 --> 00:08:32.620
if there are mistakes,
they help them.

00:08:32.620 --> 00:08:36.650
So it is a learning
process for these women.

00:08:36.650 --> 00:08:41.630 position:56%
They get help, Afghan Women's
Writing Project give them a platform

00:08:41.630 --> 00:08:46.410
to write about their issues
and to learn another language.

00:08:46.410 --> 00:08:50.470 position:56%
And if they want to write in their
own language, they can write in Dari

00:08:50.470 --> 00:08:53.170
or Pashto for people
who do not know English

00:08:53.170 --> 00:08:55.860
or they can't write in English.

00:08:55.860 --> 00:09:00.550
And we also have another wonderful
amazing program that we reach

00:09:00.550 --> 00:09:02.930
out to women who are illiterate.

00:09:02.930 --> 00:09:05.050
So we have oral stories.

00:09:05.050 --> 00:09:08.400
We reach out to women
who want to tell stories

00:09:08.400 --> 00:09:11.260
and they don't have--
They can't write.

00:09:11.260 --> 00:09:16.490
And then we collect those
oral stories and we--

00:09:16.490 --> 00:09:20.530
they record their voices
and then we put them online.

00:09:20.530 --> 00:09:26.360 position:56%
So this is another stage that we are
working to have them on the website.

00:09:26.360 --> 00:09:32.240
So, I'm going to start with one
of my poems that was published

00:09:32.240 --> 00:09:35.760
in the book "Washing the
Dust from Our Heart".

00:09:35.760 --> 00:09:40.840
And this is a collection
of poems from our students

00:09:40.840 --> 00:09:43.450
that was published
in this anthology.

00:09:43.450 --> 00:09:46.710
And Afghan Women's Writing Project
has published two anthology.

00:09:46.710 --> 00:09:49.010
This is the second one.

00:09:55.170 --> 00:10:00.410
The title of the poem is "When
We Were King and Queens".

00:10:01.830 --> 00:10:05.780
When I think of my childhood,
I remember the old days,

00:10:05.780 --> 00:10:11.590
when I was a little girl, with
black braided hair like goat horns.

00:10:11.590 --> 00:10:16.620
In summer, my five siblings and
I would sit on a wooden bed,

00:10:16.620 --> 00:10:21.100
the huge bed my father made
in the middle of the yard.

00:10:21.100 --> 00:10:23.900
First, we threw little
rugs on the bed,

00:10:23.900 --> 00:10:27.070
then we fought to get
the best corner.

00:10:27.070 --> 00:10:29.220
The breeze was our playmate.

00:10:29.220 --> 00:10:31.510
She brushed our faces.

00:10:31.510 --> 00:10:35.540
Cooled our hearts, slapped
the mosquitoes and flies.

00:10:35.540 --> 00:10:40.060
Like a scented friend, it
carried the aroma of flowers

00:10:40.060 --> 00:10:43.790
and wheat from farther fields.

00:10:43.790 --> 00:10:48.780
Our house, in a vast meadow
with a few other houses,

00:10:48.780 --> 00:10:53.450
was a little flower in a bare
garden, but we didn't feel alone.

00:10:53.450 --> 00:10:56.630
God was also our neighbor.

00:10:56.630 --> 00:10:59.950
We laughed on the wooden--
we laughed on the wooden bed,

00:10:59.950 --> 00:11:04.020
drank black tea, and
played with marbles

00:11:04.020 --> 00:11:10.240
as our white dog jumped
happily, circling the bed like as

00:11:10.240 --> 00:11:12.790
if it's were a sacred shrine.

00:11:12.790 --> 00:11:19.030
I loved her small puppies rolling
on the dusty ground with them,

00:11:19.030 --> 00:11:25.220 position:56%
swirling them around by their little
paws and bursting into laughter.

00:11:25.220 --> 00:11:28.960
They were like balls of
cotton and I kissed their paws

00:11:28.960 --> 00:11:31.820
and caressed them with love.

00:11:31.820 --> 00:11:35.700
Some neighbors said,
"Dogs are Najis, filthy."

00:11:35.700 --> 00:11:37.930
But I treasured them.

00:11:37.930 --> 00:11:42.850
They played with us, they protected
our house, barking at strangers

00:11:42.850 --> 00:11:47.830
and enemies, their yelps
very small and screechy,

00:11:47.830 --> 00:11:50.790
but their will was strong.

00:11:50.790 --> 00:11:53.520
How could anyone call
them "unclean"?

00:11:53.520 --> 00:11:55.820
They were little angels.

00:11:55.820 --> 00:11:58.860
God wouldn't create filthy things.

00:11:58.860 --> 00:12:02.840
Sometimes we didn't have bread
in the house, I was hungry,

00:12:02.840 --> 00:12:06.890
so mother gave me a
piece of dried bread,

00:12:06.890 --> 00:12:09.310
and said "Share it with the dog.

00:12:09.310 --> 00:12:11.490
She is also hungry."

00:12:11.490 --> 00:12:15.850
Her kindness reminds me of when
she cooked okra with Kichiri.

00:12:15.850 --> 00:12:19.000
We sat on the wooden bed
and we ate in the moonlight.

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:25.620
We didn't have electricity, but
our hearts were bright and happy.

00:12:25.620 --> 00:12:29.860
As we laughed, our teeth
shone like the stars.

00:12:29.860 --> 00:12:32.300
We named the stars to own them.

00:12:32.300 --> 00:12:34.840
My eyes like a basket.

00:12:34.840 --> 00:12:40.020
I picked them until they escaped
from my eyes and entered my heart.

00:12:40.020 --> 00:12:45.090
In my best childhood memories,
we were all together, me,

00:12:45.090 --> 00:12:49.570
my siblings, my mother, my father.

00:12:49.570 --> 00:12:53.460
We weren't yet broken
by war or separated,

00:12:53.460 --> 00:12:57.130
each thrown to a corner
of the earth.

00:12:57.130 --> 00:13:00.660
With free minds and happy
hearts, we laughed together

00:13:00.660 --> 00:13:03.550
and adored simple things.

00:13:03.550 --> 00:13:08.510
On the wooden bed, we
were kings and queens.

00:13:08.510 --> 00:13:13.320
[ Applause ]

00:13:13.320 --> 00:13:14.770
Thank you very much.

00:13:14.770 --> 00:13:18.650
So, I want to explain a little
bit how did I get involved

00:13:18.650 --> 00:13:20.420
with this project.

00:13:20.420 --> 00:13:27.080
It was in-- I came to United States
and got a scholarship in 2009.

00:13:27.080 --> 00:13:30.670
And then I received the Davis
Peace Project to go back

00:13:30.670 --> 00:13:35.200
to Afghanistan to do
a peace project.

00:13:35.200 --> 00:13:37.290
And in Afghanistan, I saw an email.

00:13:37.290 --> 00:13:38.770
I saw-- I read a poem.

00:13:38.770 --> 00:13:41.750
It was a poem that was from
Afghan Woman's Writing Project.

00:13:41.750 --> 00:13:48.840
One, it was so beautiful and
emotional that it made me cry.

00:13:48.840 --> 00:13:53.530
And I immediately wanted
to be part of this program.

00:13:53.530 --> 00:13:58.030
So I contacted the founder
and I told her that I want

00:13:58.030 --> 00:13:59.380
to be part of this program.

00:13:59.380 --> 00:14:01.850
And she said, "Yes, you're welcome.

00:14:01.850 --> 00:14:03.150
Come and join us."

00:14:03.150 --> 00:14:04.890
And then I got involved.

00:14:04.890 --> 00:14:08.280
So I started in 2010
with them as a writer.

00:14:08.280 --> 00:14:14.270
I started writing for them
and then after a few years,

00:14:14.270 --> 00:14:18.160
they started their Dari program
and they asked me to be the mentor

00:14:18.160 --> 00:14:21.500
for the Dari program for
students who are in Afghanistan

00:14:21.500 --> 00:14:24.290
and they do not speak
or write in English.

00:14:24.290 --> 00:14:28.190
And I started the Dari
Program, Dari workshop,

00:14:28.190 --> 00:14:31.270
and now we have a secondary
workshop and soon,

00:14:31.270 --> 00:14:35.550
we are going to have the third Dari
workshop which is a great honor.

00:14:35.550 --> 00:14:41.880
So today we have some other Afghans
Women's Writing writers with us.

00:14:41.880 --> 00:14:45.430
Some of the students who
live in United States.

00:14:45.430 --> 00:14:49.320
Usually, the students
that we enroll,

00:14:49.320 --> 00:14:52.930
they all need to be
always in Afghanistan.

00:14:52.930 --> 00:14:57.690
They start in Afghanistan with
us or they can be refugees.

00:14:57.690 --> 00:15:04.150 position:56%
But for women-- Afghan women who are
here like we can't work with them.

00:15:04.150 --> 00:15:06.360
For the refugees that
we've work for, you know,

00:15:06.360 --> 00:15:08.820
either in Iran or Pakistan.

00:15:08.820 --> 00:15:13.300
So some of the students who are in
United States, they first started

00:15:13.300 --> 00:15:15.900
with Afghan Women's Writing
Project in Afghanistan.

00:15:15.900 --> 00:15:21.450
And today, we have one
of our great writers,

00:15:21.450 --> 00:15:27.030
Marzia that she will
be reading for us.

00:15:27.030 --> 00:15:29.020
&gt;&gt; Marzia: "War".

00:15:29.020 --> 00:15:31.330
To buy his family's safety,

00:15:31.330 --> 00:15:37.150
your father spends every Afghani
he has saved for the last 30 years.

00:15:37.150 --> 00:15:40.760
Your mother sells her
jewelry so she can feed you

00:15:40.760 --> 00:15:43.510
and your brothers and sisters.

00:15:43.510 --> 00:15:49.260
Your brother gives up his beloved
car, and you give up your education

00:15:49.260 --> 00:15:52.140
because you have no other option.

00:15:52.140 --> 00:15:55.900
Gunfire and rockets,
like the devil screaming,

00:15:55.900 --> 00:15:58.190
wake you up in the
middle of the night.

00:15:58.190 --> 00:16:01.170
The explosions vibrate
through your heart.

00:16:01.170 --> 00:16:06.110
Nothing can calm you, not
even your mother's arms.

00:16:06.110 --> 00:16:08.280
You see torn bodies on the TV.

00:16:08.280 --> 00:16:11.640
Mothers like crying over
their sons' corpses.

00:16:11.640 --> 00:16:13.810
Widows weep for their children.

00:16:13.810 --> 00:16:16.100
Who will feed them today?

00:16:16.100 --> 00:16:20.520
War means living in fear,
with families torn apart.

00:16:20.520 --> 00:16:23.200
Flowers lose their
color, become gray.

00:16:23.200 --> 00:16:27.020
Dark circles under your
eyes, your skin pale.

00:16:27.020 --> 00:16:32.620 position:56%
You see everything in black and
white, cannot feel the sun's warmth,

00:16:32.620 --> 00:16:36.530
the wind's breeze, see how
bright the moon and the stars.

00:16:36.530 --> 00:16:39.240
Your best friend flees
to another place.

00:16:39.240 --> 00:16:42.620
You miss her, become
lonely, isolated.

00:16:42.620 --> 00:16:47.270
She was the one you shared your
secrets with and played with.

00:16:47.270 --> 00:16:52.790
You don't feel safe without her,
not even in your own bedroom.

00:16:52.790 --> 00:16:54.150
War means poverty.

00:16:54.150 --> 00:16:56.110
People kill for food.

00:16:56.110 --> 00:16:57.990
Parents sell their children.

00:16:57.990 --> 00:16:59.990
Children sell opium.

00:16:59.990 --> 00:17:01.780
Girls marry old men.

00:17:01.780 --> 00:17:05.730
Teenagers take responsibilities
that are too big.

00:17:05.730 --> 00:17:10.160
They feel old, begin to be
cruel, see things they shouldn't,

00:17:10.160 --> 00:17:12.330
do things they shouldn't.

00:17:12.330 --> 00:17:14.050
You see women killed.

00:17:14.050 --> 00:17:17.030
Of course, they have
been raped first,

00:17:17.030 --> 00:17:19.650
because they are honored
by their enemies.

00:17:19.650 --> 00:17:23.400
And yes, you see yourself
used as a tool of war,

00:17:23.400 --> 00:17:27.740
and sold because no
one can protect you.

00:17:27.740 --> 00:17:31.960
War makes the warlord
thirstier and thirstier.

00:17:31.960 --> 00:17:36.020
He cares only about himself,
seeks to drink power,

00:17:36.020 --> 00:17:39.140
becomes blind, deaf, a liar.

00:17:39.140 --> 00:17:42.680
With no laws, no rules,
you make no goals anymore

00:17:42.680 --> 00:17:44.700
for your unknown future.

00:17:44.700 --> 00:17:47.240
You become cheap, worthless.

00:17:47.240 --> 00:17:51.080
War means nightmares for
you, your family, your world.

00:17:51.080 --> 00:17:54.350
Every single sound scares you.

00:17:54.350 --> 00:17:57.100
War tastes as terrible as it is.

00:17:57.100 --> 00:18:02.340
You have no appetite, not
even for your favorite meal.

00:18:02.340 --> 00:18:04.140
Thank you.

00:18:04.140 --> 00:18:06.880
[ Applause ]

00:18:06.880 --> 00:18:08.460 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Mahnaz Rezaie: Thank you, Marzia.

00:18:08.460 --> 00:18:10.690
So, we have another AWWP writer.

00:18:10.690 --> 00:18:12.660
She is my sister.

00:18:12.660 --> 00:18:16.310
I'm very happy that she
is here with us today.

00:18:16.310 --> 00:18:21.600
She recently graduated from Saint
Michael's College in Vermont.

00:18:21.600 --> 00:18:25.310
And she moved here like a week ago.

00:18:25.310 --> 00:18:27.510
So please welcome her.

00:18:27.510 --> 00:18:33.810
[ Applause ]

00:18:33.810 --> 00:18:38.020
&gt;&gt; Rahela: Thank you, Mahnaz,
and thank you all for coming.

00:18:38.020 --> 00:18:43.580
So today, I'm going to share two
of my pieces that it got published

00:18:43.580 --> 00:18:46.320
in Afghan Woman Writing Project.

00:18:46.320 --> 00:18:50.820
The first piece is
a poem that I wrote.

00:18:50.820 --> 00:18:52.970
"Break the Rule".

00:18:52.970 --> 00:18:56.750
I want to break the rule
and say I am in love.

00:18:56.750 --> 00:19:01.920
My people taught me not to love
someone because I am a woman,

00:19:01.920 --> 00:19:05.740
because I am a girl,
because of my gender,

00:19:05.740 --> 00:19:10.120
because of my culture,
because of my religion.

00:19:10.120 --> 00:19:14.340
No! God is not against love.

00:19:14.340 --> 00:19:17.380
He loves the one who is in love.

00:19:17.380 --> 00:19:18.700
I am in love.

00:19:18.700 --> 00:19:23.690
Yes! I am a girl and I am in love.

00:19:23.690 --> 00:19:26.980
Let me love the one who I want.

00:19:26.980 --> 00:19:30.430
Let me choose the one who I love.

00:19:30.430 --> 00:19:34.040
Let me experience what love is.

00:19:34.040 --> 00:19:38.240
Let me have something
that I want for myself.

00:19:38.240 --> 00:19:41.540
Men can fall in love
but women cannot.

00:19:41.540 --> 00:19:46.260
Why? We do not have a heart?

00:19:46.260 --> 00:19:48.340
We don't have feelings.

00:19:48.340 --> 00:19:50.350
We do not have choice.

00:19:50.350 --> 00:19:53.960
We are not human.

00:19:53.960 --> 00:19:55.320
Love is pure.

00:19:55.320 --> 00:19:57.620
Love is holy.

00:19:57.620 --> 00:19:59.580
Love is valuable.

00:19:59.580 --> 00:20:02.110
It is not against the law.

00:20:02.110 --> 00:20:04.570
It is not against religion.

00:20:04.570 --> 00:20:06.740
It is not against culture.

00:20:06.740 --> 00:20:08.940
It is not against humanity.

00:20:08.940 --> 00:20:15.060
But if it is against the rule,

00:20:15.060 --> 00:20:20.160
I want to break this rule
and say "I am in love."

00:20:20.160 --> 00:20:23.830
And I love that I am in love.

00:20:23.830 --> 00:20:25.630
Thank you.

00:20:25.630 --> 00:20:28.840
[ Applause ]

00:20:28.840 --> 00:20:31.470
My second piece is "Culture Shock".

00:20:31.470 --> 00:20:34.650
And I wrote this in 2011.

00:20:34.650 --> 00:20:40.970
I didn't know the meaning of
culture shock before I came

00:20:40.970 --> 00:20:44.680
to the United States, but now I do.

00:20:44.680 --> 00:20:46.880
As an international student coming

00:20:46.880 --> 00:20:52.140
from a religious conservative
country like Afghanistan to study

00:20:52.140 --> 00:20:56.590
in a liberal, democratic
country like the US,

00:20:56.590 --> 00:21:02.610
the move definitely shocked my
nerves and appetite for a while.

00:21:02.610 --> 00:21:08.450
When I first arrived, it
was the superficial matters

00:21:08.450 --> 00:21:11.530
that grabbed my attention,
like clothing,

00:21:11.530 --> 00:21:15.020
talking, hairstyle, and fashion.

00:21:15.020 --> 00:21:19.700
I was shocked the first time
I saw women wearing bikinis

00:21:19.700 --> 00:21:23.360
in the public near the beach.

00:21:23.360 --> 00:21:27.250
We have public bathhouse
for women in my country,

00:21:27.250 --> 00:21:31.730
but what embarrassed me was
seeing the women talking

00:21:31.730 --> 00:21:34.330
to men who were with them.

00:21:34.330 --> 00:21:39.830
The men had a live view of
99% of the woman's naked body.

00:21:39.830 --> 00:21:43.580
I may have shocked them as
well, because I was walking

00:21:43.580 --> 00:21:48.360
on the beach fully
dressed with my scarf on.

00:21:48.360 --> 00:21:54.430
Afghans are always trying to avoid
the sun so they will not get tanned

00:21:54.430 --> 00:21:58.830
but some Americans love
to be out in the sun,

00:21:58.830 --> 00:22:03.590
even though they know
about skin cancer.

00:22:03.590 --> 00:22:08.350
Also, tattoos are common here,

00:22:08.350 --> 00:22:12.450
but seeing whole body
tattoo was shocking.

00:22:12.450 --> 00:22:15.220
What if the design
gets boring next year?

00:22:15.220 --> 00:22:20.000
Or what if a man's
wife does not like it?

00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:27.330
Pets, especially dogs, are dear
in this country, sometimes dearer

00:22:27.330 --> 00:22:29.700
and closer than family members.

00:22:29.700 --> 00:22:36.400
I did not know how hard it was
to take care of them, bathe them,

00:22:36.400 --> 00:22:40.380
and feed them or even
play with them!

00:22:40.380 --> 00:22:46.630 position:56%
Yes, in the United States, they even
have vaccinations for their pets.

00:22:46.630 --> 00:22:50.980
We just started the vaccination
process for children in our country

00:22:50.980 --> 00:22:56.490
and almost half of the population
has never ever had a vaccine

00:22:56.490 --> 00:22:58.760
in their lives.

00:22:58.760 --> 00:23:01.500
It is still shocking for me to know

00:23:01.500 --> 00:23:07.750
that in some countries animals
are as valuable as humans.

00:23:07.750 --> 00:23:12.870
Also, I still cannot eat
rice properly with a fork.

00:23:12.870 --> 00:23:15.640
It's frustrating seeing
the grains escape

00:23:15.640 --> 00:23:18.900
from the prongs when I am hungry.

00:23:18.900 --> 00:23:22.360
It is interesting how forks
and knives are important

00:23:22.360 --> 00:23:26.130
in most of the meals in the US.

00:23:26.130 --> 00:23:32.050
In Afghanistan, I only use a knife
for peeling and cutting fruits.

00:23:32.050 --> 00:23:36.780
I think that it is polite
when Americans say "Excuse me"

00:23:36.780 --> 00:23:44.760
after yawning or sneezing, but
what about blowing the nose?

00:23:44.760 --> 00:23:47.070
That was the most funny

00:23:47.070 --> 00:23:50.320
and disgusting culture
shock I experienced.

00:23:50.320 --> 00:23:55.650
In my culture, it is impolite to
blow your nose in front of others.

00:23:55.650 --> 00:24:01.440 position:56%
However, sometimes it made me laugh
and reminded me of the jokes I heard

00:24:01.440 --> 00:24:05.230
from my friends when I was child.

00:24:05.230 --> 00:24:09.020
Americans like books
and enjoy reading books,

00:24:09.020 --> 00:24:11.480
magazines, and newspapers.

00:24:11.480 --> 00:24:15.630
We can find people reading
during the day, at night,

00:24:15.630 --> 00:24:22.110
or like on the bus or in
the hospital waiting room.

00:24:22.110 --> 00:24:27.230
But it was shocking for me to
learn that we can even find books

00:24:27.230 --> 00:24:30.920 position:56%
and magazines in American bathrooms.

00:24:30.920 --> 00:24:36.480 position:56%
Sometimes being in different culture

People teach us about
their own lifestyles

00:24:44.360 --> 00:24:49.960
and we teach them the
way we like to live.

00:24:49.960 --> 00:24:53.460
No one has to follow the
others, but the point is

00:24:53.460 --> 00:24:57.410
to appreciate human beings'
existence and our uniqueness.

00:25:06.280 --> 00:25:11.440
So in two years ago I got
admitted to Corcoran School of Arts

00:25:11.440 --> 00:25:15.450
and Design at the New Media
Photojournalism Program.

00:25:15.450 --> 00:25:20.450
And after a year, I spoke with
my program director and told her

00:25:20.450 --> 00:25:24.260
that I want to find a way.

00:25:24.260 --> 00:25:29.170
I want to make a collaboration
between Corcoran School of Arts

00:25:29.170 --> 00:25:33.160
and Design with the Afghan
Women's Writing Project.

00:25:33.160 --> 00:25:39.800
And since we have photography
department at the Corcoran School

00:25:39.800 --> 00:25:44.380
and even in my program we do a
lot photography and video making.

00:25:44.380 --> 00:25:48.340
I said, "Why don't we
choose an Afghan woman poem

00:25:48.340 --> 00:25:51.040
and respond to it via art?"

00:25:51.040 --> 00:25:54.020
Because it will be a collaboration

00:25:54.020 --> 00:25:57.560
between American students
and Afghan women.

00:25:57.560 --> 00:25:59.920
And my supervisor,
she loved the idea

00:25:59.920 --> 00:26:02.720
and we started the
Blue Wings project.

00:26:02.720 --> 00:26:04.770
The Blue Wings project
is a collaboration

00:26:04.770 --> 00:26:06.970
between the Afghan
Women's Writing Project

00:26:06.970 --> 00:26:09.540
and Corcoran School
of Arts and Design.

00:26:09.540 --> 00:26:16.370 position:56%
And we invite all different artists
to respond to an Afghan women's poem

00:26:16.370 --> 00:26:20.560
to arts whether it is
photography, short video,

00:26:20.560 --> 00:26:25.140
animation, any form of art.

00:26:25.140 --> 00:26:28.980
And last March 8th, we
had a very big event

00:26:28.980 --> 00:26:33.430
that we celebrated all the
artistic pieces that were done

00:26:33.430 --> 00:26:37.400
on Afghan Women's Writing
Project and Afghan woman's poems.

00:26:37.400 --> 00:26:41.480
And today, I'm going to show
you some of those pieces.

00:26:59.070 --> 00:27:07.050
So some of the students choose
to do photography and I'm going

00:27:07.050 --> 00:27:10.010
to read the poem that's one

00:27:10.010 --> 00:27:14.000
of the students get this

The poem is by Roya and the title of
the poem is "Remembering Fifteen".

00:27:21.930 --> 00:27:23.770
And I feel so young.

Pains start growing inside of me.

00:27:27.360 --> 00:27:31.810
I begin to hear, "you have
to", "have to", "have to".

00:27:31.810 --> 00:27:34.110
I have to live that "have to".

00:27:34.110 --> 00:27:38.070
I have to buy a "burqa" and
hide the world under it.

00:27:38.070 --> 00:27:40.450
I have to forget the sun.

00:27:40.450 --> 00:27:43.130
To talk about the moon is a risk.

00:27:43.130 --> 00:27:45.850
I have to wear clothes
people choose.

00:27:45.850 --> 00:27:48.310
The colors they dictate.

00:27:48.310 --> 00:27:51.370
I have to live with
negative imperatives.

Don't look at men!

Shut up! I am hearing-- I am bored
of hearing, "Don't, Don't, Don't".

I am fifteen and the boy I can't
forget waits on the street to see me

way to Lala's bakery.

00:28:13.670 --> 00:28:18.470

Love is blind for him.

00:28:23.410 --> 00:28:26.050
He lives with the smell of a woman.

00:28:26.050 --> 00:28:32.400
And Mama always says, be like
other people, be like other people.

00:28:32.400 --> 00:28:34.500
I wonder if I agree.

00:28:34.500 --> 00:28:38.350

the pain of being human,

the pain of being a woman, the pain

00:28:41.180 --> 00:28:44.580
if Dad discovers the postcards
hidden between the bricks

00:28:44.580 --> 00:28:46.470
of the wall, the pain

if the neighbor's naughty son steals
the postcards, the pain if Dad says,

washes the mud off the wall

where the letters are hidden.

00:29:01.670 --> 00:29:06.870
The rain does wash the mud away
along with his words on the letter,

00:29:06.870 --> 00:29:10.430
"I love you and I love
your blue burqa."

his love from my heart.

with blue wings.

that smelled like sorrow.

Another poem I would like to read
is by Secara [assumed spelling].

00:42:51.200 --> 00:42:52.500
I Apologize.

00:42:52.500 --> 00:42:59.760
I apologize not because I am a
big person or because I am shy

00:42:59.760 --> 00:43:03.890
or powerless or immature or poor.

00:43:03.890 --> 00:43:08.790
I apologize not because it
makes me less than I am.

00:43:08.790 --> 00:43:13.490
I apologize because I am strong,
because I believe in humanity

00:43:13.490 --> 00:43:19.160
and because I have self-confidence
and because I am sick of sin.

00:43:19.160 --> 00:43:23.030
I apologize because my
life is full of dreams

00:43:23.030 --> 00:43:26.330
and because I want to
see everyone happy.

00:43:26.330 --> 00:43:33.340
I apologize because apology
is a way of ending hostility

00:43:33.340 --> 00:43:37.860
and because my heart is full
of love and because I want

00:43:37.860 --> 00:43:41.740
to make the world a peaceful place,

00:43:41.740 --> 00:43:45.500
a place full of love
and forgiveness.

How to Heal the World by
Freiba [assumed spelling].

00:44:25.930 --> 00:44:29.780
This is the beginning of May
for love and forgiveness.

00:44:29.780 --> 00:44:34.040
The end of the way is not clear
to me because in this moment,

00:44:34.040 --> 00:44:39.350
love and forgiveness
are lovable to me.

00:44:39.350 --> 00:44:42.850
I'm on to write about
you here in this plan.

00:44:42.850 --> 00:44:47.070
About your eyes, their spring song.

00:44:47.070 --> 00:44:53.140
About your tender words, their
smile of simplicity and honesty.

00:44:53.140 --> 00:44:57.240
When you're not with me, I
say, Allah Hafiz to everyone.

00:44:57.240 --> 00:45:03.760
Without you my beloved, I'm silent
without laughter or the speech.

00:45:03.760 --> 00:45:06.390
Come to me, open your eyes.

00:45:06.390 --> 00:45:08.890
The windows to my darkness.

00:45:08.890 --> 00:45:10.490
My soul to youth.

00:45:10.490 --> 00:45:12.630
Return home.

00:45:12.630 --> 00:45:14.020
Return again.

00:45:14.020 --> 00:45:17.740
Share the beat of my heart
with all the worse people

00:45:17.740 --> 00:45:19.890
who are failed in love.

00:45:19.890 --> 00:45:21.740
Please come with me.

00:45:21.740 --> 00:45:24.320
Love and forgive each other.

00:45:24.320 --> 00:45:31.180
Our lives too short, men grace for
the love and forgiveness too long

00:45:31.180 --> 00:45:34.060
when full of stress and hatred.

00:45:34.060 --> 00:45:36.040
That's it.

ask any questions please feel free

00:45:50.120 --> 00:45:51.420
to get up and ask.

00:45:51.420 --> 00:45:55.850
I also want to put in a comment and
say that the folks of University

00:45:55.850 --> 00:45:58.950
of Maryland Persian Studies,
they wanted to be here,

00:45:58.950 --> 00:46:02.080
unfortunately school is out
and they're all in vacation.

00:46:02.080 --> 00:46:06.140
So, they asked me to extend their
apologies that they're not here.

00:46:06.140 --> 00:46:12.230 position:56%
However, this is a fantastic program
and translating poems are not easy

00:46:12.230 --> 00:46:16.250
and you really see when you
read the original and hear it

00:46:16.250 --> 00:46:20.030
and then you see the English,
it really is a task to be able

00:46:20.030 --> 00:46:24.660
to convey them but they have done
such a beautiful job translating.

00:46:24.660 --> 00:46:27.060
So, I'm really, really
pleased to hear this

00:46:27.060 --> 00:46:30.290
and if you have any
questions feel free to ask.

00:46:32.400 --> 00:46:34.200
&gt;&gt; Mahnaz Rezaie: Yes?

[ Inaudible Remark ]

00:47:00.470 --> 00:47:04.390
So, he's asking if the writing--

00:47:04.390 --> 00:47:10.410
Afghan Women's Writing
Project exist in Afghanistan.

00:47:10.410 --> 00:47:14.660 position:56%
The writing, Afghan Women's
Writing Project is an online project

00:47:14.660 --> 00:47:20.000 position:56%
but we do have office in Afghanistan
and we have monthly workshops

00:47:20.000 --> 00:47:26.310 position:56%
that women come to the office and
they have Dari or English workshops.

00:47:26.310 --> 00:47:30.890
And also, it's a very secure space
for women who do not want to go

00:47:30.890 --> 00:47:37.230
to like cafe nets that there are
men there or they'll get harassed.

00:47:37.230 --> 00:47:41.250
So it's a very safe and calm place
to come and write their pieces

00:47:41.250 --> 00:47:46.170
if they want and use the internet
and send their pieces online.

00:47:46.170 --> 00:47:47.970
Yes?

[ Inaudible Remark ]

00:47:58.000 --> 00:48:01.050
&gt;&gt; Mahnaz Rezaie: Thank
you for having us.

00:48:01.050 --> 00:48:09.090
&gt;&gt; I wanted to ask you if those
who participate in these programs

00:48:09.090 --> 00:48:12.420
in terms of demographics.

00:48:12.420 --> 00:48:21.220
Do they belong to a
certain age group?

00:48:21.220 --> 00:48:32.670
Are they more in some
region that others?

00:48:32.670 --> 00:48:41.980
Do they have a particular profile
if you want as they're writing

00:48:41.980 --> 00:48:45.480
or is it attract the board,
attract eligibly and you know,

00:48:45.480 --> 00:48:50.090
how you describe the
women who participate

00:48:50.090 --> 00:48:53.810
in your project, the
455 participants?

00:48:53.810 --> 00:48:58.120
&gt;&gt; Mahnaz Rezaie: So
demographically for these women.

00:48:58.120 --> 00:49:06.720
Demographics for these women, so
you ask what are the demographic

00:49:06.720 --> 00:49:12.470
for women and what are the
age groups for these women

00:49:12.470 --> 00:49:18.710
for the participants of
these online workshops?

00:49:18.710 --> 00:49:22.550
The women who participate
are different age groups.

00:49:22.550 --> 00:49:24.400
We have teenagers.

00:49:24.400 --> 00:49:31.320
We have women who are married
and in their older ages.

00:49:31.320 --> 00:49:35.390
The oral stories, there are
grandmothers who they're like voice

00:49:35.390 --> 00:49:38.250
or somebody, they tell somebody.

00:49:38.250 --> 00:49:42.100
They record their voice and
then other reader writes those

00:49:42.100 --> 00:49:45.310
and then we have somebody
to narrate those.

00:49:45.310 --> 00:49:48.160
So, we have different
age groups and we work

00:49:48.160 --> 00:49:50.090
in six provinces in Afghanistan.

00:49:50.090 --> 00:49:51.450
I would believe that
most of our writers are

00:49:51.450 --> 00:49:55.420
from the big cities
like Kabul and Herat.

00:49:55.420 --> 00:49:58.770
But we have writers from Kandahar.

00:49:58.770 --> 00:50:01.440
Kandahar is more conservative
and it's a [inaudible] city so,

00:50:01.440 --> 00:50:04.350
we would see less women participate
because of the security reason

00:50:04.350 --> 00:50:05.650
and the conservative
culture of their city.

00:50:05.650 --> 00:50:06.950
So, the way that women reach out
to each other through this group,

00:50:06.950 --> 00:50:08.250
the way that it works is
that we don't announce like,

00:50:08.250 --> 00:50:09.740
we accept students come here.

00:50:09.740 --> 00:50:13.170
So, it's word of mouth
between the students.

00:50:13.170 --> 00:50:15.820 position:56%
A student knows like she's part of--

00:50:15.820 --> 00:50:17.890
she's participant and
she tells a friend

00:50:17.890 --> 00:50:22.490
and that friend become
part of the workshop.

00:50:22.490 --> 00:50:24.590
So, because of the security reason,

00:50:24.590 --> 00:50:31.000
we always want somebody confirm the
participation of another student

00:50:31.000 --> 00:50:34.220
and there, and we have
students who do not--

00:50:34.220 --> 00:50:37.070
we do not publish their name.

00:50:37.070 --> 00:50:42.400
They just write in their
pen name or anonymously

00:50:42.400 --> 00:50:44.270
because of their security reasons.

00:50:44.270 --> 00:50:47.120
Some of their parents do
not want them to write

00:50:47.120 --> 00:50:49.920
or their brothers or uncles.

00:50:49.920 --> 00:50:54.320
So, we respect their situation.

00:50:55.820 --> 00:50:57.120
Yes?

00:50:57.120 --> 00:50:58.420
&gt;&gt; Going along with that.

00:50:58.420 --> 00:51:17.730 position:56%
I was wondering where your website
is posted and if you've got some fax

00:51:19.310 --> 00:51:25.610
on the website, on the project
or it's another security reason

00:51:25.610 --> 00:51:28.120
for this [inaudible]
you're saying that writing

00:51:28.120 --> 00:51:30.870
under a student from other issues--

00:51:30.870 --> 00:51:33.200
&gt;&gt; Mahnaz Rezaie: The website is--
the IT personnel and everybody.

00:51:33.200 --> 00:51:37.310
The main staff are here in United
States and that's one of the reason

00:51:37.310 --> 00:51:39.230
that we want to have the editor,
some of the main staff to have

00:51:39.230 --> 00:51:42.140
in United States in case
something goes wrong in Afghanistan

00:51:42.140 --> 00:51:44.560
because of the security situation.

00:51:44.560 --> 00:51:49.620
But our main way of like
connecting with the students is

00:51:49.620 --> 00:51:54.780
through internet and usually
most of the students have a phone

00:51:54.780 --> 00:51:58.830
that they can connect to
internet and write or something

00:51:58.830 --> 00:52:05.370
or send something and we do
provide them with small computers

00:52:05.370 --> 00:52:08.570
and like laptops and
also internet stick

00:52:08.570 --> 00:52:13.710
that they can stay
home and use them.

00:52:13.710 --> 00:52:15.960
I hope I answered your question.

00:52:15.960 --> 00:52:23.920
Yeah. But they are very-- they
think a lot about their security

00:52:23.920 --> 00:52:28.980
of these women on how to run
the organization in a way

00:52:28.980 --> 00:52:31.000
that they keep the women safe.

00:52:31.000 --> 00:52:35.220
Yeah. Any other question?

00:52:36.640 --> 00:52:37.940

00:52:37.940 --> 00:52:39.240
