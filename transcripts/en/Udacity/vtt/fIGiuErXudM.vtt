00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
I think that this is the best answer.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
The problem with this answer, even though it may seem appealing initially,

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.000
is that without knowing the true circumference, this number--34,000 km--

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
is sort of meaningless.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.000
What if the earth had a circumference of 10 bajillion km?

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:23.000
Well, then an error of 34,000 km would be nothing in comparison to that.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000
So, I really have to reference point for what this number means.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
This is actually a pretty good description of Plato's error--

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
that the true circumference is about half.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.000
But this one's a little better, because it gives me a little more precision.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.000
I have an actual number. Plato's guess was 85% larger than the true circumference.

00:00:41.000 --> 99:59:59.000
This is the best statement of error.
