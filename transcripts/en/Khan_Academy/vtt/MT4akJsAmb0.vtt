00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:02.290
We've already spent a
lot of time thinking

00:00:02.290 --> 00:00:05.030
about these six different
scenarios, all of which

00:00:05.030 --> 00:00:08.720
sit on the production
possibilities frontier, which

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:11.450
means that in any
of these scenarios,

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:14.420
we have achieved
productive efficiency.

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:16.170
And it's true not just
of these scenarios.

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:18.730
It's true of any of the
points on this curve.

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:21.380
So you have achieved,
any point on that curve,

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:24.220
productive-- let
me give ourselves

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:28.240
some real estate on
the right-- efficiency.

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:37.700
Which means, another
way to think about it,

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:41.600
is that as soon as you're
at any point on that curve,

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:43.560
if you want any more
of one of these things

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:45.300
you have to give up
some of the other.

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.290
So for example, if
you're at point C,

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:50.040
and if you want more rabbits,
if you want 1 more rabbit,

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:53.410
you're going to have to
give up some berries.

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:57.580
Or if you're at point C
and you want more berries,

00:00:57.580 --> 00:01:00.420
you're going to have to
give up some rabbits.

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:03.400
And that's true of any point
on the production possibilities

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:04.220
frontier.

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:07.540
A point over here-- let me
do this in a different color.

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:09.800
So let's say at this
point right over here,

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:12.170
you have not achieved
productive efficiency here

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:16.950
because you can get more
rabbits without having

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:18.490
to give up any berries.

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:24.220
And you could get to Scenario
B. Or you could get more berries

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:25.970
and not have to
give up any rabbits,

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:27.390
and you would get to Scenario D.

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.085
So this right over
here is inefficient.

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:34.950
Now, all of these,
that's all good.

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:36.969
All of these five
or six scenarios,

00:01:36.969 --> 00:01:38.510
we've achieved
productive efficiency.

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:40.390
But which of these do we pick?

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:43.251
How do we decide to
allocate our time?

00:01:43.251 --> 00:01:45.000
So what I want to talk
about in this video

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.450
is allocative efficiency.

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:56.350
And it's somewhat subjective,
based on the preferences of,

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:59.520
if we are the hunter gatherer,
based on our preferences.

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.020
But at least it
gives us a framework

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:04.930
for thinking, which of these
meets our preferences the best.

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:07.720
And to do that, I will review a
little bit from the last video.

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:09.990
In the last video, we talked
about the marginal cost

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:11.275
of each incremental rabbit.

00:02:11.275 --> 00:02:14.230
Or we said the opportunity cost
of each incremental rabbit,

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:17.000
and the opportunity cost of
one incremental unit, that

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.120
really is just
the marginal cost.

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:22.870
So let's just write these
different scenarios.

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:26.710
So let's write the scenarios,
scenario for short,

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:28.040
scene for short.

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:29.990
And then let's think
about the marginal cost

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:32.720
of 1 incremental rabbit.

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:36.190
I'll just draw a rabbit here.

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:37.995
And it's going to
be given in berries.

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:45.320
All right.

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:46.900
Let's start with
Scenario F. And this

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:48.860
is all review from
the last video.

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:54.450
Sitting in Scenario F, if we
want to get 1 extra rabbit,

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:59.090
we are going to have
to give up 20 berries.

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:02.280
In Scenario E, if we're
sitting in Scenario E,

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:05.370
and we want even 1
more rabbit we now

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:09.070
have to give up 40 berries.

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:13.490
So the marginal cost at
that point of 1 more,

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:17.390
I keep wanting to say squirrel,
1 more rabbit is 40 berries.

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:21.665
Now let's go to Scenario D.
And I encourage you to pause

00:03:21.665 --> 00:03:22.540
and do this yourself.

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:24.740
It'll help if you
kind of work it out.

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:30.530
Scenario D, the cost of 1
extra rabbit is now 60 berries.

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:39.680
You go to Scenario C. The
cost is now 80 berries.

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:42.490
So in Scenario C the
cost is now 80 berries.

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:45.710
Finally you got to
Scenario B and the cost

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:49.340
of, sitting in Scenario B, of
getting 1 extra rabbit-- you're

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:51.680
going to have to
give up 100 berries.

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:57.190
And I won't even
go into Scenario A,

00:03:57.190 --> 00:04:00.020
because it will be impossible
for you to have any more

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:02.680
rabbits and you have no
more berries to give up.

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:04.400
So these are all the
possible scenarios

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:06.490
and the marginal costs of them.

00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:08.540
And we can actually
plot them on a line.

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:10.540
So let me do that
right over here.

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:12.680
This will be useful.

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:19.010
So let me draw one axis right
over here, one axis over here.

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:23.290
And this is, let's call this
the different scenarios.

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:26.840
So this-- let me do
in the same order.

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:32.205
Let's call this
Scenario F, Scenario E.

00:04:32.205 --> 00:04:33.830
I'll just do it in
one color right now.

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:41.030
Scenario E, Scenario D, Scenario
C and Scenario B. Actually,

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:42.760
let me-- instead of
doing it that way,

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:44.280
let me just talk
about it in terms

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:47.360
of the number of
squirrels I have.

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:50.330
So the number of
squirrels that I have.

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:54.680
So in Scenario F, if you
remember, in Scenario F-- oh,

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:56.220
not squirrels, rabbits.

00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:59.320
In Scenario F you
have 0 rabbits.

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:01.690
Scenario F you have 0 rabbits.

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:10.350
So let's say 0,
1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:14.130
And so this is the number
of rabbits, not squirrels,

00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:16.790
the number of rabbits
that you right now

00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:19.110
are able to catch,
on average, each day.

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:24.670
And then in the vertical
axis, right now,

00:05:24.670 --> 00:05:29.730
I want to put the
marginal cost in berries.

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:34.700
And let's see, it goes
from 20 up to 100.

00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:44.260
So let's say that this is
20, 40, 60, 80, and 100.

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:48.310
So Scenario F, that's
when we had 0 rabbits.

00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:52.729
And the marginal cost of
trying to get another rabbit,

00:05:52.729 --> 00:05:54.270
you would have to
give up 20 berries.

00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:56.540
So that is Scenario
F right over there.

00:05:56.540 --> 00:06:02.170
Scenario E, that's one where
we had 1, where we already

00:06:02.170 --> 00:06:05.410
had 1 rabbit and we are
thinking about the marginal cost

00:06:05.410 --> 00:06:06.640
of getting another one.

00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:10.180
So that's scenario E,
is right over there.

00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:14.050
This is scenario D.
Marginal cost is 60.

00:06:14.050 --> 00:06:15.640
We already have 2
rabbits and we are

00:06:15.640 --> 00:06:17.190
thinking about getting a third.

00:06:17.190 --> 00:06:18.910
That's Scenario D.

00:06:18.910 --> 00:06:23.680
And then Scenario C, we
already have 3 rabbits,

00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:25.290
thinking about getting a fourth.

00:06:25.290 --> 00:06:28.360
That's Scenario C.
And then finally, we

00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:31.760
have Scenario B where we
already have 4 rabbits

00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:34.300
and we're thinking
about getting a fifth.

00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:36.750
And we would have to
give up 100 berries

00:06:36.750 --> 00:06:39.580
to get that fifth rabbit.

00:06:39.580 --> 00:06:41.500
So that's Scenario
B right over there.

00:06:41.500 --> 00:06:44.410
So what I've just done is
plotted the marginal cost

00:06:44.410 --> 00:06:48.070
along-- these are points on,
essentially, our marginal cost

00:06:48.070 --> 00:06:50.520
curve, our marginal
cost as a function

00:06:50.520 --> 00:06:52.720
of the number of
rabbits we have.

00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:54.497
So let me connect all the dots.

00:06:54.497 --> 00:06:56.580
And then this scenario
just happened to be a line.

00:06:56.580 --> 00:06:59.860
Doesn't always have to be a
line but in many introductory

00:06:59.860 --> 00:07:03.290
economics courses, it's
often a line for simplicity.

00:07:03.290 --> 00:07:07.130
So let me make this a
line right over here.

00:07:07.130 --> 00:07:09.540
This is our marginal
cost as a function

00:07:09.540 --> 00:07:12.620
of the number of
rabbits we have.

00:07:12.620 --> 00:07:15.220
And actually, I should
probably draw this axis,

00:07:15.220 --> 00:07:18.660
I should probably draw--
let me copy and paste this.

00:07:18.660 --> 00:07:20.580
So let me cut this.

00:07:20.580 --> 00:07:25.610
Let me cut that and then let
me paste it, because it really

00:07:25.610 --> 00:07:29.460
should sit on the 0
point right over there.

00:07:29.460 --> 00:07:33.125
And ignore that little
line right over there.

00:07:33.125 --> 00:07:35.500
So there you have marginal
cost as a function of berries.

00:07:35.500 --> 00:07:38.000
But we still don't know
which scenario to pick.

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:40.850
And to think about that, I
want to introduce something

00:07:40.850 --> 00:07:42.400
called the marginal benefit.

00:07:46.610 --> 00:07:51.520
And I'll write it as
MB, the marginal benefit

00:07:51.520 --> 00:07:55.660
of an incremental rabbit.

00:07:55.660 --> 00:07:58.740
And once again, we're going
to write it in berries.

00:07:58.740 --> 00:08:01.200
And the way to think
about the marginal benefit

00:08:01.200 --> 00:08:03.980
is, if we are the
hunter-gatherer we're saying,

00:08:03.980 --> 00:08:06.940
if we're sitting in one of
these scenarios, how much would

00:08:06.940 --> 00:08:10.820
we paid to some hypothetical
convenience store in berries--

00:08:10.820 --> 00:08:14.190
maybe that convenience
store only sells bunnies

00:08:14.190 --> 00:08:16.310
and they only accept
berries-- how much would we

00:08:16.310 --> 00:08:19.720
pay to them in berries
for an extra rabbit?

00:08:19.720 --> 00:08:22.270
And let's not even look at
this thing right over here.

00:08:22.270 --> 00:08:25.600
So if we're sitting in Scenario
F, we're sitting in Scenario F.

00:08:25.600 --> 00:08:27.570
And you remember Scenario
F is right over here.

00:08:27.570 --> 00:08:29.380
We have no rabbits.

00:08:29.380 --> 00:08:31.090
How much would we
be willing to pay?

00:08:31.090 --> 00:08:33.772
We have no rabbits and we
actually have a ton of berries.

00:08:33.772 --> 00:08:35.730
So in Scenario F right
here, we have no rabbits

00:08:35.730 --> 00:08:37.890
and we have 300 berries.

00:08:37.890 --> 00:08:39.960
If we have no rabbits
and a lot of berries,

00:08:39.960 --> 00:08:41.918
let's say, we'll say, we
have a lot of berries.

00:08:41.918 --> 00:08:43.840
We might be in the
mood for a rabbit.

00:08:43.840 --> 00:08:46.660
We would be willing to pay a
lot in berries for a rabbit.

00:08:46.660 --> 00:08:50.580
So let's say we would pay 100.

00:08:50.580 --> 00:08:55.390
We would pay 100 berries to
that hypothetical convenience

00:08:55.390 --> 00:08:57.410
store for a rabbit.

00:08:57.410 --> 00:09:01.680
Now let's say that we're in
Scenario E. We're in Scenario

00:09:01.680 --> 00:09:04.450
E, how much would we pay to that
hypothetical convenience store?

00:09:04.450 --> 00:09:07.910
Well, in Scenario E we
already have 1 rabbit

00:09:07.910 --> 00:09:09.520
and we have fewer berries.

00:09:09.520 --> 00:09:12.737
So we need a rabbit less and
we have fewer berries to give,

00:09:12.737 --> 00:09:14.820
so we're not willing to
give quite as many berries

00:09:14.820 --> 00:09:16.190
for another rabbit.

00:09:16.190 --> 00:09:18.280
So maybe we'll only
give 80 berries.

00:09:18.280 --> 00:09:20.910
Then you go to Scenario D.

00:09:20.910 --> 00:09:24.060
We already have 2 rabbits and
we have even fewer berries

00:09:24.060 --> 00:09:26.090
so we're willing to
give even fewer berries

00:09:26.090 --> 00:09:27.219
for another rabbit.

00:09:27.219 --> 00:09:29.260
This is what we would pay
to a convenience store,

00:09:29.260 --> 00:09:32.310
just based on thinking about
it, our current preferences.

00:09:32.310 --> 00:09:34.220
Then we can go all
the way to Scenario C.

00:09:34.220 --> 00:09:35.095
And it is subjective.

00:09:35.095 --> 00:09:36.470
It's not like a
measurable thing.

00:09:36.470 --> 00:09:38.420
It's just based on this
person's preferences,

00:09:38.420 --> 00:09:40.870
this hunter-gatherer's
preferences.

00:09:40.870 --> 00:09:45.370
Scenario C, well, they already
have more rabbits, even

00:09:45.370 --> 00:09:47.480
fewer berries.

00:09:47.480 --> 00:09:49.250
So they'll pay even less.

00:09:49.250 --> 00:09:51.950
And then finally
Scenario B. They

00:09:51.950 --> 00:09:55.480
have a good number of rabbits
and even fewer berries.

00:09:55.480 --> 00:09:58.880
They would be willing
to pay very little

00:09:58.880 --> 00:10:02.510
for an incremental rabbit.

00:10:02.510 --> 00:10:04.260
So let's plot the
marginal benefit

00:10:04.260 --> 00:10:08.240
as a function of the number of
rabbits that they already have.

00:10:08.240 --> 00:10:11.760
So if we go to Scenario
F, the marginal benefit,

00:10:11.760 --> 00:10:14.560
doing that little thought
experiment is 100.

00:10:14.560 --> 00:10:17.710
In Scenario E, the
marginal benefit,

00:10:17.710 --> 00:10:19.200
how much you would
hypothetically

00:10:19.200 --> 00:10:22.600
be willing to pay in
berries, is now 80 berries.

00:10:22.600 --> 00:10:25.530
In Scenario D it is 60 berries.

00:10:25.530 --> 00:10:29.680
In Scenario C it is 40 berries.

00:10:29.680 --> 00:10:32.170
So Scenario C is
right over here.

00:10:32.170 --> 00:10:34.810
So in Scenario C
it's 40 berries.

00:10:34.810 --> 00:10:40.140
And then in Scenario
B it is 20 berries.

00:10:40.140 --> 00:10:44.680
So in Scenario B it is 20
various, just like that.

00:10:44.680 --> 00:10:46.920
So now we're not just
plotting the marginal cost.

00:10:46.920 --> 00:10:50.200
We're plotting the marginal
cost and the marginal benefit

00:10:50.200 --> 00:10:51.070
in berries.

00:10:51.070 --> 00:10:53.420
And the marginal
benefit curve-- and it's

00:10:53.420 --> 00:10:55.550
really a line here, once
again, for simplicity--

00:10:55.550 --> 00:10:57.400
looks like that.

00:10:57.400 --> 00:11:00.830
Now, given this-- so this is
the marginal benefit curve.

00:11:00.830 --> 00:11:03.550
Marginal benefit is a function
of the number of rabbits

00:11:03.550 --> 00:11:04.710
that we already have.

00:11:04.710 --> 00:11:07.390
And this is the marginal
cost as a function

00:11:07.390 --> 00:11:09.590
of the number of
rabbits we already have.

00:11:09.590 --> 00:11:11.580
And so when I say
E, this is actually

00:11:11.580 --> 00:11:16.410
Situation E. That's Situation
D. This is also Situation C

00:11:16.410 --> 00:11:19.760
and this is also-- this is the
marginal benefit at Situation

00:11:19.760 --> 00:11:23.170
B. So given this, what
would I rationally do?

00:11:23.170 --> 00:11:25.030
If these really
are my preferences,

00:11:25.030 --> 00:11:26.540
what would I rationally do?

00:11:26.540 --> 00:11:30.980
So if I'm sitting here in
Situation F, I have no rabbits.

00:11:30.980 --> 00:11:34.370
I already know that it
would cost me 20 rabbits

00:11:34.370 --> 00:11:37.000
to try to get an
incremental one.

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:39.500
But I've already said that
I'd be willing to pay 100.

00:11:39.500 --> 00:11:41.290
Sorry, it would
cost me 20 berries

00:11:41.290 --> 00:11:42.866
to get an incremental rabbit.

00:11:42.866 --> 00:11:44.740
But I've already said
that I'm willing to pay

00:11:44.740 --> 00:11:47.190
100 berries to get an
incremental rabbit.

00:11:47.190 --> 00:11:51.290
So I would want to
move along the curve.

00:11:51.290 --> 00:11:56.810
So I would definitely
want to get more rabbits.

00:11:56.810 --> 00:11:59.520
I said that I'm willing to
pay 100 berries for a rabbit

00:11:59.520 --> 00:12:01.870
and it would only cost me
20 berries for a rabbit.

00:12:01.870 --> 00:12:06.150
So I'm saying that I
want to get more rabbits.

00:12:06.150 --> 00:12:08.990
And another way to look at
this visually, marginal benefit

00:12:08.990 --> 00:12:11.500
is much higher than
marginal cost here.

00:12:11.500 --> 00:12:14.770
So I'm willing to go forth
and try to get more rabbits.

00:12:14.770 --> 00:12:19.350
That's even true in Scenario
E. The marginal benefit

00:12:19.350 --> 00:12:21.830
of an incremental rabbit
is worth much more to me

00:12:21.830 --> 00:12:23.880
than the marginal cost,
so I'm willing to try

00:12:23.880 --> 00:12:25.580
to get more rabbits.

00:12:25.580 --> 00:12:29.620
So in Scenario E I'm still
trying to get more rabbits.

00:12:29.620 --> 00:12:33.300
I still want to move along
the production possibilities

00:12:33.300 --> 00:12:37.650
frontier in this
general direction.

00:12:37.650 --> 00:12:43.355
Now what happens as
I get closer to D?

00:12:43.355 --> 00:12:45.360
So if I'm in this
scenario right over here,

00:12:45.360 --> 00:12:47.480
and this isn't one of
our labeled scenarios,

00:12:47.480 --> 00:12:49.880
but if I'm right
over there-- still,

00:12:49.880 --> 00:12:53.060
my marginal cost is lower
than my marginal benefit.

00:12:53.060 --> 00:12:55.970
So I'll still want to get
more rabbits, all the way

00:12:55.970 --> 00:12:56.990
until I'm Scenario D.

00:12:56.990 --> 00:12:58.890
In Scenario D I'm a
little bit neutral.

00:12:58.890 --> 00:13:00.820
I'm willing to pay 60
berries for a rabbit,

00:13:00.820 --> 00:13:02.320
but that's exactly
how much I'd have

00:13:02.320 --> 00:13:04.430
to give up to get
that extra rabbit.

00:13:04.430 --> 00:13:06.940
So let's just think about
Scenario D for a little bit.

00:13:06.940 --> 00:13:08.440
I'll just circle
it right over here.

00:13:08.440 --> 00:13:10.760
Because it looks
kind of interesting.

00:13:10.760 --> 00:13:12.290
Now, let's go--
now would we want

00:13:12.290 --> 00:13:14.530
to do anything
beyond Scenario D?

00:13:14.530 --> 00:13:16.800
So if I'm at this
point right over here,

00:13:16.800 --> 00:13:18.440
if I'm working
enough on average,

00:13:18.440 --> 00:13:21.640
to say get 2 and
1/2 rabbits a day,

00:13:21.640 --> 00:13:23.760
would I-- does this
make sense for me

00:13:23.760 --> 00:13:25.880
to try to get any more rabbits?

00:13:25.880 --> 00:13:27.895
Well, at that point
the benefit of getting

00:13:27.895 --> 00:13:30.767
an incremental rabbit
is smaller than the cost

00:13:30.767 --> 00:13:31.600
of getting a rabbit.

00:13:31.600 --> 00:13:34.220
At that point, if I try
to get another rabbit,

00:13:34.220 --> 00:13:38.941
I'm getting less benefit from
it than the cost associated

00:13:38.941 --> 00:13:39.440
with it.

00:13:39.440 --> 00:13:42.230
So I definitely don't
want to move past D.

00:13:42.230 --> 00:13:45.410
So I achieve
allocative efficiency

00:13:45.410 --> 00:13:49.770
where my marginal cost and
my marginal benefit is equal.

00:13:49.770 --> 00:13:51.800
So based on the way
that I've rigged

00:13:51.800 --> 00:13:54.150
the numbers in this
example right over here,

00:13:54.150 --> 00:13:57.800
you want to settle
on Scenario D.

00:13:57.800 --> 00:14:01.070
We have achieved allocated
efficiency over there.

00:14:01.070 --> 00:14:05.030
The marginal cost as a
function of our rabbits

00:14:05.030 --> 00:14:09.510
and the marginal benefit of our
function of rabbits is equal.
