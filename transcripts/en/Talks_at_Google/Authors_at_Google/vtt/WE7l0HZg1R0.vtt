[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.807 --> 00:00:07.890
MIKE LEWIS: I wanted to
play a really quick video,

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:10.640
mostly because it's been
a long time in the making

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:12.920
and I kind of feel like
we should put it to use.

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:15.590
So it's 90 seconds,
obviously hosted on YouTube.

00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:16.910
So we're all good there.

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:19.854
And enjoy it.

00:00:19.854 --> 00:00:20.520
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:23.400
- In May of 2014 I set in a
Boston airport with my life

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:26.330
sitting next to me in a
hulking baby blue roller bag

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:28.310
and a one-way ticket to
New Zealand in my hand.

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:30.820
I had a dream to
chase, a jump to make,

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:33.570
and someday a book I wanted to
write about how and when to go

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:34.380
do it.

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:36.450
Before I boarded this
flight, I asked a stranger

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:38.752
to take this video
as I spun my racket.

00:00:38.752 --> 00:00:40.710
I was off to play the
professional squash tour.

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:42.740
Squash is a niche racket sport.

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:45.420
In squash you spin the
racket to start a match.

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.480
I was beginning to
start my own match.

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:50.580
My plans were for a few
months, maybe three, maybe six.

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:52.520
If I was lucky, I figured
I could couch surf

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:54.600
for the first few weeks,
stay with friends,

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.220
friends of friends,
host families,

00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:58.210
strangers, just so I
can experience life

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:00.150
for a little bit as
they were living it.

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:01.650
And then something
funny happened.

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:03.660
The universe and
hundreds of strangers

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:06.810
helped to make my
dream come true.

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:08.680
A few months turned it
in nearly two years,

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:12.270
200,000 miles, six continents,
and about 50 countries.

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.280
In that time I spent
nearly every night

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:17.400
with people, bartenders
and fellow bus passengers,

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.040
single parents to Millennials.

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:22.410
I slept along farmlands and in
skyscrapers, along mountaintops

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:23.810
and across villages.

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:26.790
I stayed with creators and
makers and chefs and teachers,

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:30.000
skydivers, farmers,
activists, entrepreneurs.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.850
Now, four years later, my
next dream is coming true.

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:36.020
The book of a story made
possible by these strangers.

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:37.920
A book about when to
chase your dreams.

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.240
A book about when to jump.

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:43.570
To the over 400 beautiful humans
who gave me a place to stay,

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:45.930
memory to treasure, thank you.

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:47.760
Truly, thank you.

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:50.205
I've got a couch with your
name on it in San Francisco.

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:00.114
[END PLAYBACK]

00:02:00.114 --> 00:02:01.530
MIKE LEWIS: I did
not ever think--

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:03.540
and I truly believe this--

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:06.450
that I'd be standing here
talking about this book.

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:11.270
And I first want to say thanks
to Google for having me.

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:13.300
I also want to say thanks
to Google Headquarters

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:14.830
in San Francisco.

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:18.520
My roommate, who pushed me
to see this book through,

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:20.740
works at Waze, and
it was because of him

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:23.170
that I was able to eat on
Google's tab three to five days

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:25.450
a week.

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:27.700
Still do, so hopefully
this doesn't make

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:28.960
its way-- it probably will.

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:30.010
Sorry.

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:34.870
I am not an employee, just
a fan of the cafeteria.

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:36.860
But I figured since
we're in a smaller group

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:38.530
and this is the
last events we'll

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:41.230
do on the UK leg
of the tour, I'd

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:45.160
love to tell just my story
and a little bit of the why

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:48.470
and what made me want to
put these stories together.

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:50.800
And then, obviously, I would
love to hear about yours

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:54.950
and answer any questions
that might come up.

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:59.630
So backing up a bit, five years
ago I was sitting in my office,

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:02.650
and I picked up a
phone and called

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:08.070
a woman who I'd been reading
about in a magazine on my desk.

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:10.380
And the article was
about how this woman just

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:13.716
competed in the 2012
Olympics here in London.

00:03:13.716 --> 00:03:15.090
At the very end
of the article it

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:17.100
talked about how she
worked in a corporate job

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:19.269
before becoming a cyclist.

00:03:19.269 --> 00:03:21.310
And the rest of the article
is about the Olympics

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:22.810
and how it felt
and all this stuff,

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:27.880
and all I cared about was that
transition of doing something

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:31.060
that probably wasn't expected or
was a bit of a surprise to her

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:33.267
and maybe even a risk.

00:03:33.267 --> 00:03:35.100
And she ended up picking
up the phone, which

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:37.890
was pretty weird
looking back on it,

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:42.791
and her first question was,
how did you get my number?

00:03:42.791 --> 00:03:44.040
And I said, you know, I just--

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:48.340
I'd love to know what led
you to take this jump.

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:51.700
And what she said over
the next 45 minutes,

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:54.300
it had nothing to do
with being an Olympian

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:57.830
or trying to train to become
an athlete, and everything

00:03:57.830 --> 00:04:01.670
to do with that voice in
her head and conversations

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:05.090
with her parents and what it
felt like to think of failure

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:08.030
and not maybe having a
job again if she couldn't

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:10.192
succeed at the next thing.

00:04:10.192 --> 00:04:12.150
And it was funny because
earlier that night I'd

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:14.370
googled when to
chase your dreams.

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:15.710
Has anyone ever done that?

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:18.950
If you haven't, don't.

00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:20.180
I'll sum it up for you.

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:22.040
You get two things.

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:25.660
One is a lot of the inspiration
and the feel-good stories.

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:29.910
And then on the other side,
you get the Instagram photos,

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:33.299
the beautiful LinkedIn posts,
the Facebook news feed updates,

00:04:33.299 --> 00:04:35.340
which you kind of like
really don't want to read,

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:38.780
but then you end up reading, and
you're like, ah, my life sucks.

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:40.370
How did this person make it?

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:43.090
How did this happen so easily?

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:45.770
And while all that's great and
the inspiration's certainly

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:48.620
there, we're at no lack
of it on the internet,

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:53.340
what really struck me was that
there's a whole middle section

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:55.350
of doing what you love.

00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:57.750
And that conversation
with the cyclist

00:04:57.750 --> 00:05:00.930
covered what I call these
10,000 unsexy steps that

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:03.324
go with chasing a dream,
but no one talks about that.

00:05:03.324 --> 00:05:04.740
You see the beginning
and then you

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:06.420
see kind of the
fairytale ending,

00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:09.030
but you don't talk about
the restarts, the failures,

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:11.670
the insecurities,
the hesitations.

00:05:11.670 --> 00:05:17.010
And to me, sitting in that desk
at work, it wasn't really about

00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:18.272
do I take this jump or not.

00:05:18.272 --> 00:05:20.730
It was about are there other
people who have done something

00:05:20.730 --> 00:05:24.280
risky, whatever that may be.

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:27.450
And so I thought back
to 10 years earlier.

00:05:27.450 --> 00:05:29.530
I grew up in
Southern California.

00:05:29.530 --> 00:05:30.760
And who here plays squash?

00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:32.530
Are there any squash
players, people--

00:05:32.530 --> 00:05:33.030
one?

00:05:33.030 --> 00:05:33.390
OK.

00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:34.380
That's about average.

00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:35.432
OK.

00:05:35.432 --> 00:05:37.050
Do you know what squash is?

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:37.550
OK.

00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:40.415
That's many more
than where I grew up.

00:05:40.415 --> 00:05:41.790
Everyone thought
I was harvesting

00:05:41.790 --> 00:05:44.300
vegetables in the winter.

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:48.810
There was one club within 200
kilometers of where I grew up

00:05:48.810 --> 00:05:53.110
and it had the only courts
in those 200 kilometers.

00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:54.710
And I found when I
was 14 years old.

00:05:54.710 --> 00:05:58.040
And I thought someday I'm going
to play the highest level.

00:05:58.040 --> 00:05:59.705
Does anyone know
the pro squash tour?

00:05:59.705 --> 00:06:00.330
What about you?

00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:01.371
You're the squash player?

00:06:01.371 --> 00:06:02.860
Do you know of it?

00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:06.307
Well, you are in the majority
of people who don't know much

00:06:06.307 --> 00:06:07.390
about the pro squash tour.

00:06:07.390 --> 00:06:09.520
It's like the pro tennis
tour, but the ugly

00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:12.130
stepchild that no
one ever talks about.

00:06:12.130 --> 00:06:12.770
It's similar.

00:06:12.770 --> 00:06:15.310
You play by yourself
against somebody else.

00:06:15.310 --> 00:06:17.520
But you don't make any money.

00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:19.530
And in fact, when you
have a tournament that

00:06:19.530 --> 00:06:22.260
goes through towns like
ours in Santa Barbara,

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:25.050
the families that are
part of the community

00:06:25.050 --> 00:06:26.460
will host a player.

00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:28.260
So I signed up our
family when I was 14

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:30.034
to host a traveling player.

00:06:30.034 --> 00:06:32.200
And we had a conversation
that would come back to me

00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:34.630
10 years later in
my office cubicle

00:06:34.630 --> 00:06:37.730
after speaking to that
woman who was the cyclist.

00:06:37.730 --> 00:06:40.460
Because the guy sitting
across the table from me

00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:43.054
as a 14-year-old said, you
know, you should do this.

00:06:43.054 --> 00:06:45.470
If you get good enough you can
play on mountains in Brazil

00:06:45.470 --> 00:06:50.440
and cities in Asia
and go to Europe.

00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:52.510
I'd never been out of
the country and so,

00:06:52.510 --> 00:06:55.690
to me, that was truly
surreal, to think

00:06:55.690 --> 00:06:59.460
there was a whole world out
there that you could explore.

00:06:59.460 --> 00:07:02.220
And so I sat with this
story from a woman

00:07:02.220 --> 00:07:04.920
10 years later saying that
you can chase your dreams,

00:07:04.920 --> 00:07:07.700
but it's going to
be pretty tough.

00:07:07.700 --> 00:07:09.900
And you're not alone
in trying to do it.

00:07:09.900 --> 00:07:11.460
And so I sketched a cover page--

00:07:11.460 --> 00:07:12.990
and this was five years ago.

00:07:12.990 --> 00:07:15.960
And I was with my buddy
at work named Corey,

00:07:15.960 --> 00:07:17.510
and we the last
two in the office.

00:07:17.510 --> 00:07:19.610
Do you guys remember the
ice bucket challenge?

00:07:19.610 --> 00:07:20.250
Yeah?

00:07:20.250 --> 00:07:22.470
So Corey actually started
that for his friend

00:07:22.470 --> 00:07:25.730
from Boston College named
Pete Frates, who has ALS.

00:07:25.730 --> 00:07:27.770
Corey was this
larger than life guy.

00:07:27.770 --> 00:07:29.326
I said, Corey, this
should be a book,

00:07:29.326 --> 00:07:31.200
but this should be
actually a community where

00:07:31.200 --> 00:07:33.870
you can come together,
share what you want to do,

00:07:33.870 --> 00:07:36.630
have good food, beers,
talk about things that you

00:07:36.630 --> 00:07:38.640
might otherwise feel
weird to mention.

00:07:38.640 --> 00:07:42.077
Maybe it means totally
changing everything.

00:07:42.077 --> 00:07:44.160
And then maybe it's just
doing something different

00:07:44.160 --> 00:07:49.254
on the weekends, learning a
new language, volunteering.

00:07:49.254 --> 00:07:51.170
I had started to collect
more of these stories

00:07:51.170 --> 00:07:53.970
and it just seemed
like, whether it

00:07:53.970 --> 00:07:58.650
was a fellow bus passenger
or Corey next door,

00:07:58.650 --> 00:08:01.679
or the lady down at the
bar, or the receptionist

00:08:01.679 --> 00:08:03.720
at the front desk, everyone
had this little voice

00:08:03.720 --> 00:08:05.230
in their head.

00:08:05.230 --> 00:08:06.960
And so I was sharing
this woman's story,

00:08:06.960 --> 00:08:09.720
first anecdotally, and then kind
of writing it down and passing

00:08:09.720 --> 00:08:11.322
it around.

00:08:11.322 --> 00:08:12.780
And to be honest,
the reason I said

00:08:12.780 --> 00:08:15.238
I didn't think I'd ever be here
is because I never really--

00:08:15.238 --> 00:08:16.980
I mean, I guess I
sketched a cover page.

00:08:16.980 --> 00:08:18.330
But I didn't think it'd
actually be a book.

00:08:18.330 --> 00:08:20.220
I thought this would
give me permission

00:08:20.220 --> 00:08:23.490
to tell my parents I'm not
totally crazy for leaving a job

00:08:23.490 --> 00:08:25.320
that I really cared about.

00:08:25.320 --> 00:08:28.457
I was working at a venture
firm called Bain Capital.

00:08:28.457 --> 00:08:29.790
They're here, they're in Boston.

00:08:29.790 --> 00:08:33.730
I felt like I won the
lottery to be in this role.

00:08:33.730 --> 00:08:36.950
And I felt really
kind of selfish

00:08:36.950 --> 00:08:40.429
to think of doing anything
different than what

00:08:40.429 --> 00:08:44.600
my parents wanted, what my
five siblings wanted for me.

00:08:44.600 --> 00:08:47.400
I felt like it'd be
weird to bring up.

00:08:47.400 --> 00:08:53.060
And yet, here was this story
that was giving me permission.

00:08:53.060 --> 00:08:56.710
And so I ended up joining
the Pro Tour part time.

00:08:56.710 --> 00:09:00.384
I spent two years
and saved up money.

00:09:00.384 --> 00:09:02.425
I talked to my friends at
work and my supervisor.

00:09:02.425 --> 00:09:04.600
I said, I think I'm
going to do this.

00:09:04.600 --> 00:09:06.740
And I was not a very good
squash player growing up.

00:09:06.740 --> 00:09:10.470
That's kind of a detail
that the book leaves out.

00:09:10.470 --> 00:09:12.820
But I wanted to give it a try.

00:09:12.820 --> 00:09:17.500
And over what I call
these 10,000 unsexy steps,

00:09:17.500 --> 00:09:20.040
of listening to the voice
and then making a plan,

00:09:20.040 --> 00:09:22.364
and saving up and
playing tournaments,

00:09:22.364 --> 00:09:24.780
I actually got to play my first
pro tournament while still

00:09:24.780 --> 00:09:25.560
at Bain.

00:09:25.560 --> 00:09:27.030
Took a sick day.

00:09:27.030 --> 00:09:29.010
I went down to Virginia.

00:09:29.010 --> 00:09:31.882
I was playing the
world number 90.

00:09:31.882 --> 00:09:33.840
To give you perspective,
I was the world number

00:09:33.840 --> 00:09:39.490
387, which may or may not--
should not sound impressive,

00:09:39.490 --> 00:09:43.560
especially that if you
have an internet connection

00:09:43.560 --> 00:09:46.750
and pay 100 pounds, you can
be the world number 387.

00:09:46.750 --> 00:09:49.230
It is the last spot
on the Pro Tour.

00:09:49.230 --> 00:09:50.290
So I had paid the money.

00:09:50.290 --> 00:09:50.970
I was a pro player.

00:09:50.970 --> 00:09:51.510
I go down.

00:09:51.510 --> 00:09:54.390
I'd been training, feeling
pretty good about myself.

00:09:54.390 --> 00:09:58.520
And I didn't score a point
in the first match, which

00:09:58.520 --> 00:10:02.272
is actually really hard to
do, to not score a point.

00:10:02.272 --> 00:10:03.230
But I managed to do it.

00:10:03.230 --> 00:10:04.389
My dad had come down.

00:10:04.389 --> 00:10:05.930
We kind of looked
at each other like,

00:10:05.930 --> 00:10:08.750
is this the thing you're about
to quit your job to go do?

00:10:08.750 --> 00:10:13.030
Because it doesn't--
might not add up.

00:10:13.030 --> 00:10:16.030
And then after a few more
matches and a bunch more

00:10:16.030 --> 00:10:18.340
saving, I ended up leaving Bain.

00:10:18.340 --> 00:10:20.920
I took that video in
the Boston airport

00:10:20.920 --> 00:10:22.830
and I moved to New Zealand.

00:10:22.830 --> 00:10:25.680
And I thought three months
would be, at most, the tour.

00:10:25.680 --> 00:10:27.680
And then I'd come back,
maybe go to grad school.

00:10:27.680 --> 00:10:28.940
That seems like what you
do when you don't really

00:10:28.940 --> 00:10:30.450
know what you want to do.

00:10:30.450 --> 00:10:32.910
At least, to me that
was a safe landing.

00:10:32.910 --> 00:10:36.510
Maybe, if they'd let me
back, go back to Bain.

00:10:36.510 --> 00:10:38.730
Three months turned
into six months.

00:10:38.730 --> 00:10:41.010
The first month of
tournaments, there

00:10:41.010 --> 00:10:44.759
were probably 20 guys there
from 32 different countries.

00:10:44.759 --> 00:10:46.800
And one person passed me
off to someone in Brazil

00:10:46.800 --> 00:10:48.450
and then Australia,
and then someone

00:10:48.450 --> 00:10:51.420
who's someone in France
and South Pacific.

00:10:51.420 --> 00:10:55.260
Six months turned into 12
months, turned into two years.

00:10:55.260 --> 00:10:57.370
And every night but one
I was with other people.

00:10:57.370 --> 00:10:59.580
And every time I sat
down at a dinner table,

00:10:59.580 --> 00:11:02.520
someone would ask me about
how I knew when to jump.

00:11:02.520 --> 00:11:05.280
And so I'd pull out this one
story I had, and I'd say,

00:11:05.280 --> 00:11:07.540
yeah I'm going to make
this a book someday.

00:11:07.540 --> 00:11:09.540
Like, you know, obviously
it wasn't really going

00:11:09.540 --> 00:11:10.710
to happen in my mind.

00:11:10.710 --> 00:11:13.350
I wasn't an author.

00:11:13.350 --> 00:11:16.590
And then, sadly, my buddy
Corey passed away really

00:11:16.590 --> 00:11:19.170
early on in my trip.

00:11:19.170 --> 00:11:22.380
And it kind of hit me that
we have this much time

00:11:22.380 --> 00:11:25.500
or we have this much time
to go do what we want to do.

00:11:25.500 --> 00:11:27.820
But we definitely don't
have this much time.

00:11:27.820 --> 00:11:30.750
And part of Corey's
legacy was taking an idea

00:11:30.750 --> 00:11:33.420
and making it something bigger.

00:11:33.420 --> 00:11:34.890
And so while I was
playing squash,

00:11:34.890 --> 00:11:37.680
I started back on the project.

00:11:37.680 --> 00:11:41.460
And I got to all different
types of people--

00:11:41.460 --> 00:11:43.260
The second baseman
for the Chicago Cubs

00:11:43.260 --> 00:11:45.660
who left the Cubs
to go to college,

00:11:45.660 --> 00:11:49.680
the first female bishop in the
Anglican Church who was in PR,

00:11:49.680 --> 00:11:51.180
people at tech
companies like Google

00:11:51.180 --> 00:11:53.079
who had actually
changed offices,

00:11:53.079 --> 00:11:54.870
moved continents, stayed
within the company

00:11:54.870 --> 00:11:56.470
but done something
totally different.

00:11:56.470 --> 00:11:58.220
It really didn't matter
what the jump was,

00:11:58.220 --> 00:11:59.989
but it was showing
that there was people

00:11:59.989 --> 00:12:02.280
that were willing to take
it, and there was a community

00:12:02.280 --> 00:12:04.770
to support that.

00:12:04.770 --> 00:12:07.530
And so I came back two
years after leaving.

00:12:07.530 --> 00:12:11.510
My parents were like, you
really need to get a job now.

00:12:11.510 --> 00:12:14.760
And I was staying on my
buddy's couch in San Francisco.

00:12:14.760 --> 00:12:17.610
What I figured out was in
most cities in the world,

00:12:17.610 --> 00:12:20.580
you're unemployed if you're
on your friend's couch.

00:12:20.580 --> 00:12:24.120
In San Francisco,
you're an entrepreneur.

00:12:24.120 --> 00:12:25.800
So I was sitting on
my buddy's couch,

00:12:25.800 --> 00:12:27.030
and it's the end of the year.

00:12:27.030 --> 00:12:30.030
There's a holiday party
that someone invites me to.

00:12:30.030 --> 00:12:32.030
And I say, sure, you know,
I'll just come along.

00:12:32.030 --> 00:12:33.900
And I'd been working
on my stories, started

00:12:33.900 --> 00:12:36.680
to interview for jobs.

00:12:36.680 --> 00:12:38.360
And I bring my
stories my backpack

00:12:38.360 --> 00:12:42.410
and I pull up a seat
at this holiday party.

00:12:42.410 --> 00:12:44.892
And the woman next to
me was supposed to talk.

00:12:44.892 --> 00:12:46.100
Didn't know that at the time.

00:12:46.100 --> 00:12:48.170
She was the keynote speaker.

00:12:48.170 --> 00:12:52.800
And she's like, you
know, what's your story?

00:12:52.800 --> 00:12:55.380
I said, well-- and I had
kind of two decisions.

00:12:55.380 --> 00:12:57.104
I either tell her
the real life thing,

00:12:57.104 --> 00:12:58.770
like I need a job,
running out of money,

00:12:58.770 --> 00:13:01.597
parents expect me to get a job.

00:13:01.597 --> 00:13:03.680
Or I could dig in my
backpack and sure the stories

00:13:03.680 --> 00:13:06.407
that I'd been working on.

00:13:06.407 --> 00:13:08.740
And so I pull into my backpack
and I grab these stories.

00:13:08.740 --> 00:13:12.070
And I'd used literally
some of the last cash

00:13:12.070 --> 00:13:14.020
that I had saved up
on the squash trip

00:13:14.020 --> 00:13:15.730
to get a graphic
designer to make a logo.

00:13:15.730 --> 00:13:17.060
I had a blog set up.

00:13:17.060 --> 00:13:18.820
I had been rejected
by every editor

00:13:18.820 --> 00:13:21.490
I could ever reach out to.

00:13:21.490 --> 00:13:24.576
And what I told her was, this
someday it will be a book.

00:13:24.576 --> 00:13:26.200
And we're going to
have these festivals

00:13:26.200 --> 00:13:28.060
where people can
have beers and talk

00:13:28.060 --> 00:13:29.270
about what they want to do.

00:13:29.270 --> 00:13:30.520
We're going to have a podcast.

00:13:30.520 --> 00:13:32.800
We're going to have
a learning series.

00:13:32.800 --> 00:13:37.331
It's going to be about doing
what you love in any way.

00:13:37.331 --> 00:13:39.330
And right now we're just
starting with the blog,

00:13:39.330 --> 00:13:41.682
but it's going to get there.

00:13:41.682 --> 00:13:43.140
And she said, well,
you should just

00:13:43.140 --> 00:13:45.000
tell these stories by video.

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:48.320
And I was like, lady,
you know, that's nice.

00:13:48.320 --> 00:13:50.830
But I'm on my buddy's couch.

00:13:50.830 --> 00:13:53.560
I got, like, four weeks left in
the bank and everyone's told me

00:13:53.560 --> 00:13:56.120
I have to start with the blog.

00:13:56.120 --> 00:13:58.399
She said, well, you
know, if it's helpful,

00:13:58.399 --> 00:13:59.940
I think we could
really help you out.

00:13:59.940 --> 00:14:01.400
We'd love-- my company
does video stuff.

00:14:01.400 --> 00:14:02.483
We could partner together.

00:14:02.483 --> 00:14:04.350
Just shoot me an
email if you'd like.

00:14:04.350 --> 00:14:06.172
I said, oh, that'd be great.

00:14:06.172 --> 00:14:07.880
So she hands me her
card and I look down.

00:14:07.880 --> 00:14:10.697
It says Arianna
Huffington on it.

00:14:10.697 --> 00:14:12.530
And I said, yeah, you'll
be hearing from me.

00:14:12.530 --> 00:14:13.460
Yeah.

00:14:13.460 --> 00:14:15.100
I will reach out, my brand.

00:14:15.100 --> 00:14:16.407
Yeah.

00:14:16.407 --> 00:14:18.740
And three weeks later I played
my last squash tournament

00:14:18.740 --> 00:14:19.280
in New York City.

00:14:19.280 --> 00:14:20.321
It was my last pro event.

00:14:20.321 --> 00:14:23.466
And two hours before that
I sat across 15 executives

00:14:23.466 --> 00:14:24.590
from the "Huffington Post."

00:14:24.590 --> 00:14:27.260
And the first
question was, well,

00:14:27.260 --> 00:14:30.962
is this a brand
or just a project?

00:14:30.962 --> 00:14:32.420
I was wearing,
like, the same thing

00:14:32.420 --> 00:14:33.800
I got off the tour wearing.

00:14:33.800 --> 00:14:34.870
I had my backpack.

00:14:34.870 --> 00:14:41.160
And I look over, I said, I'm
going to say it's a brand.

00:14:41.160 --> 00:14:43.440
We are a brand.

00:14:43.440 --> 00:14:45.794
And they said, well, we'd
love to partner with you guys.

00:14:45.794 --> 00:14:47.460
And I said, well,
we'll think about that

00:14:47.460 --> 00:14:49.374
and we'll let you know.

00:14:49.374 --> 00:14:51.290
And then get in the
elevator and what do I do?

00:14:51.290 --> 00:14:53.340
I Google, before I get
out of the elevator

00:14:53.340 --> 00:14:58.100
to leave the building,
how do you start a brand.

00:14:58.100 --> 00:15:01.430
And three weeks later
I met a literary agent.

00:15:01.430 --> 00:15:04.550
She looked at me, she said, I
know people have rejected this.

00:15:04.550 --> 00:15:08.710
But I think it may not be a
book, but it should be a book.

00:15:08.710 --> 00:15:12.377
And I'm willing to
try to take this on.

00:15:12.377 --> 00:15:14.210
And when we started to
collect more stories,

00:15:14.210 --> 00:15:17.090
I think it became apparent
that "When to Jump"

00:15:17.090 --> 00:15:20.870
wasn't about that big
fairytale ending that you see,

00:15:20.870 --> 00:15:24.430
and moving to Bali and
everything just works out.

00:15:24.430 --> 00:15:27.790
It was about taking agency over
these small and big decisions

00:15:27.790 --> 00:15:29.236
in your life.

00:15:29.236 --> 00:15:31.360
And there's a lot of books
out there on inspiration

00:15:31.360 --> 00:15:35.000
and self-help, and do these
five things and it'll work out.

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:38.460
And I just think that's
not how life works.

00:15:38.460 --> 00:15:40.100
It's funny.

00:15:40.100 --> 00:15:42.980
Probably three weeks after
we launched our partnership

00:15:42.980 --> 00:15:45.760
with HuffPost and
our brand began,

00:15:45.760 --> 00:15:49.000
I was invited to
partner with Airbnb.

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:52.450
And at this point I was just
getting off my buddy's couch.

00:15:52.450 --> 00:15:55.960
I told Airbnb we'd be
thrilled to partner with them.

00:15:55.960 --> 00:15:58.750
And they had a member festival
that Ashton Kutcher and Gwyneth

00:15:58.750 --> 00:16:00.362
Paltrow were also speaking at.

00:16:00.362 --> 00:16:02.320
They said, why don't we
start our collaboration

00:16:02.320 --> 00:16:05.230
with you sharing the stage?

00:16:05.230 --> 00:16:08.350
I was like, can I get an
autograph or is that weird?

00:16:08.350 --> 00:16:10.080
Like, I'm a huge Kutcher fan.

00:16:10.080 --> 00:16:12.520
Anyway, I said, yeah.

00:16:12.520 --> 00:16:13.840
Yeah, we have a platform.

00:16:13.840 --> 00:16:15.999
We can come share that
platform with you.

00:16:15.999 --> 00:16:18.040
Also, if you spend enough
time in Silicon Valley,

00:16:18.040 --> 00:16:22.090
you just throw "platform"
in any sentence possible.

00:16:22.090 --> 00:16:23.950
And so I go down to LA
and my parents came,

00:16:23.950 --> 00:16:25.484
and they're sitting
in the first row

00:16:25.484 --> 00:16:26.650
and doors hadn't opened yet.

00:16:26.650 --> 00:16:29.830
And they came because we all
figured it might just be them

00:16:29.830 --> 00:16:31.232
and that's totally cool.

00:16:31.232 --> 00:16:33.565
I could always tell people I
got to partner with Airbnb.

00:16:36.070 --> 00:16:39.820
And the talk was about how you
can use Airbnb to make a jump.

00:16:39.820 --> 00:16:42.040
It turns out that
one in four hosts

00:16:42.040 --> 00:16:46.430
use Airbnb to save up money
to go do something different.

00:16:46.430 --> 00:16:48.890
So the doors open and we
ended up with 2,500 people

00:16:48.890 --> 00:16:50.880
in the audience.

00:16:50.880 --> 00:16:53.510
Now, I'd already made
a slideshow then.

00:16:53.510 --> 00:16:56.660
And I'd expected
it to be parents

00:16:56.660 --> 00:16:58.192
and maybe a few friends.

00:16:58.192 --> 00:16:59.900
And so at the very
end of the slide show,

00:16:59.900 --> 00:17:01.858
I actually had an email
address that went to me

00:17:01.858 --> 00:17:04.970
but was this email
to our platform.

00:17:04.970 --> 00:17:09.849
And I said to folks in the
audience, here's this email.

00:17:09.849 --> 00:17:15.140
Send your jump for next
year to our platform,

00:17:15.140 --> 00:17:18.890
and we will follow along
in what you're doing.

00:17:18.890 --> 00:17:20.410
Because we have a very--

00:17:20.410 --> 00:17:23.540
I threw out AI and smart
learning and big da--

00:17:23.540 --> 00:17:24.300
blah, blah, blah.

00:17:24.300 --> 00:17:27.990
And we'll follow up with you.

00:17:27.990 --> 00:17:30.069
And I remember looking
down my phone afterwards--

00:17:30.069 --> 00:17:31.610
and, of course, all
these went to me.

00:17:31.610 --> 00:17:36.340
So I open my phone and went
from one in the inbox to 700.

00:17:36.340 --> 00:17:38.620
And that weekend I
looked over 700 emails.

00:17:38.620 --> 00:17:42.470
And the crazy thing
was almost all--

00:17:42.470 --> 00:17:44.960
I think all but maybe 15--

00:17:44.960 --> 00:17:49.020
had nothing to do with
changing your career.

00:17:49.020 --> 00:17:51.850
It was the little things.

00:17:51.850 --> 00:17:55.510
It was like, I want
to have a family

00:17:55.510 --> 00:17:58.000
and also pursue a career.

00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:01.540
I want to have more time
for my kids on the weekends.

00:18:01.540 --> 00:18:03.820
I've always wanted
to go to France.

00:18:03.820 --> 00:18:07.110
So people were using the
hosting income to make money,

00:18:07.110 --> 00:18:08.980
and now they were
thinking of this concept

00:18:08.980 --> 00:18:10.990
of jumping as like,
I want to control

00:18:10.990 --> 00:18:13.880
the time I have in my day.

00:18:13.880 --> 00:18:16.460
And I know that sounds
probably contrived or cliche,

00:18:16.460 --> 00:18:21.350
but to me, I truly thought we'd
never get to talk to companies.

00:18:21.350 --> 00:18:23.710
Because you might read the
book title and be like, well,

00:18:23.710 --> 00:18:26.670
won't everybody leave?

00:18:26.670 --> 00:18:29.670
And now I can tell you, when
we reached 3 million people

00:18:29.670 --> 00:18:32.070
in our first video
with HuffPost.

00:18:32.070 --> 00:18:35.550
We've been fortunate that the
festival concept has grown

00:18:35.550 --> 00:18:38.760
and we're going to actually
bring it to London this year.

00:18:38.760 --> 00:18:41.460
We've reached millions of
people through our community

00:18:41.460 --> 00:18:43.230
and platform and,
hopefully, this book.

00:18:43.230 --> 00:18:45.450
And very few of the
jumps are actually

00:18:45.450 --> 00:18:48.030
about changing
everything in your life.

00:18:48.030 --> 00:18:49.570
People say chase your passion.

00:18:49.570 --> 00:18:52.530
I think that's really
awkward and weird to have

00:18:52.530 --> 00:18:56.310
to think about at lunch time.

00:18:56.310 --> 00:18:58.480
I'm all about taking
these little steps

00:18:58.480 --> 00:19:00.730
and finding that one or two
things that kind of starts

00:19:00.730 --> 00:19:03.880
to change your day.

00:19:03.880 --> 00:19:09.240
And so today, like I said,
the platform is a platform.

00:19:09.240 --> 00:19:11.634
Which, by the way, I got a
lot of feedback from Airbnb.

00:19:11.634 --> 00:19:12.800
Fortunately it was positive.

00:19:12.800 --> 00:19:15.570
We were with them yesterday.

00:19:15.570 --> 00:19:18.090
But the most common
point of feedback

00:19:18.090 --> 00:19:22.590
was, wow, people really felt
like even though it was AI,

00:19:22.590 --> 00:19:25.910
they were talking to a human on
the other side of the screen.

00:19:25.910 --> 00:19:29.050
I was like, I'll have to
tell our engineers great job.

00:19:29.050 --> 00:19:31.230
Meanwhile I was like,
da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da

00:19:31.230 --> 00:19:33.890
throwing out emails.

00:19:33.890 --> 00:19:36.720
And so now we have a little
bit more behind the platform.

00:19:36.720 --> 00:19:39.080
Now we're on whentojump.com.

00:19:39.080 --> 00:19:42.560
We started a podcast
where every Tuesday we

00:19:42.560 --> 00:19:45.682
have a 30 minute
conversation with anybody.

00:19:45.682 --> 00:19:47.640
It could be someone who
moved within a company.

00:19:47.640 --> 00:19:51.160
It could be someone who
moved around the world.

00:19:51.160 --> 00:19:54.300
My favorite conversations are
with people like this gentleman

00:19:54.300 --> 00:19:59.290
last night in London who
absolutely loves flowers.

00:19:59.290 --> 00:20:03.400
And his jump is on the weekends
he brings his skills to events,

00:20:03.400 --> 00:20:07.262
and he uses flowers
to bring them to life.

00:20:07.262 --> 00:20:08.470
He's still a project manager.

00:20:08.470 --> 00:20:11.850
He works down the street from
here, but that's his passion.

00:20:11.850 --> 00:20:15.090
And so we get enough of
those kind of data points.

00:20:15.090 --> 00:20:17.340
And we're now rolling
out a directory

00:20:17.340 --> 00:20:19.800
where if you're a
project manager turned

00:20:19.800 --> 00:20:23.430
flower guy in London,
later this year you'll

00:20:23.430 --> 00:20:28.100
be able to go and start typing
who else is a flower person.

00:20:28.100 --> 00:20:30.620
And if you're traveling
in Chicago for work

00:20:30.620 --> 00:20:32.330
and you love baking,
you can look up

00:20:32.330 --> 00:20:35.680
people who have jumped into
baking and find those people.

00:20:35.680 --> 00:20:38.887
We're actually doing a
private buildup for that.

00:20:38.887 --> 00:20:40.970
So if you want to help me
out on that you can come

00:20:40.970 --> 00:20:43.610
find me, because it's
going to start small.

00:20:43.610 --> 00:20:46.430
But we think that
someday there'll

00:20:46.430 --> 00:20:48.620
be a festival somewhere in
the world, like in London

00:20:48.620 --> 00:20:49.940
this fall.

00:20:49.940 --> 00:20:51.980
There'll be more
books like this.

00:20:51.980 --> 00:20:54.850
There'll be companies like
Google that support that idea.

00:20:54.850 --> 00:20:57.770
I think it's-- what is it,
area 120 that you guys have?

00:20:57.770 --> 00:21:00.050
Where people can actually
take the full risk

00:21:00.050 --> 00:21:04.250
of jumping and not actually have
to sacrifice so much on paper.

00:21:04.250 --> 00:21:05.630
I wish I had that.

00:21:05.630 --> 00:21:07.652
I wasn't so lucky
in where I worked.

00:21:07.652 --> 00:21:09.860
I was lucky they supported
it, but it was pretty much

00:21:09.860 --> 00:21:11.464
all or nothing.

00:21:11.464 --> 00:21:13.130
There are organizations
now that support

00:21:13.130 --> 00:21:15.980
the idea of jumping
because, if you do it right,

00:21:15.980 --> 00:21:17.750
you actually have
a meaningful career

00:21:17.750 --> 00:21:19.580
and you don't have to leave.

00:21:19.580 --> 00:21:22.670
We didn't have that
where I worked,

00:21:22.670 --> 00:21:25.740
but I think that's the way
the workforce is going.

00:21:25.740 --> 00:21:29.490
And so we hope we're
creating that community

00:21:29.490 --> 00:21:32.630
through the podcast, through the
book, through this directory,

00:21:32.630 --> 00:21:34.930
through bringing
people together.

00:21:34.930 --> 00:21:37.630
And I think we're
just getting started.

00:21:37.630 --> 00:21:41.060
So with that, I want to
thank you guys for having me.

00:21:41.060 --> 00:21:45.780
I'll stick around for Q&amp;A and be
here afterwards to sign books.

00:21:45.780 --> 00:21:47.822
But I hope this kind of
touches on the real story

00:21:47.822 --> 00:21:48.488
behind the book.

00:21:48.488 --> 00:21:50.790
And I appreciate you guys
letting me come and tell it.

00:21:50.790 --> 00:21:51.860
Thank you.

00:21:51.860 --> 00:21:54.310
[APPLAUSE]

00:21:58.240 --> 00:22:00.730
SPEAKER 1: So we have about
15 minutes for Q&amp;A. So

00:22:00.730 --> 00:22:02.950
if anybody would like
to ask a question,

00:22:02.950 --> 00:22:05.030
we need to pass
around the microphone.

00:22:05.030 --> 00:22:07.910
But I'll start off
by asking, for people

00:22:07.910 --> 00:22:11.590
who aren't 100% sure
what their passion is,

00:22:11.590 --> 00:22:13.741
but they know they want
to explore something,

00:22:13.741 --> 00:22:15.990
whether it be more creative,
more engineering-focused,

00:22:15.990 --> 00:22:17.590
maybe their own start up.

00:22:17.590 --> 00:22:21.040
How do they discover that
passion while also moving along

00:22:21.040 --> 00:22:23.560
this journey?

00:22:23.560 --> 00:22:26.740
MIKE LEWIS: Like I said, I think
social media and pop culture

00:22:26.740 --> 00:22:31.580
really kind of overblows this
find your passion, follow it.

00:22:31.580 --> 00:22:33.880
It's not like finding
sugar at the grocery store.

00:22:33.880 --> 00:22:37.040
It's like, those
things take time.

00:22:37.040 --> 00:22:39.460
You need to first,
I think, consider

00:22:39.460 --> 00:22:40.810
what makes you curious.

00:22:40.810 --> 00:22:45.570
And there's a story in the book
from a fitness entrepreneur.

00:22:45.570 --> 00:22:48.520
And he has a great
piece of advice.

00:22:48.520 --> 00:22:50.900
It's actually about training
and being in the gym.

00:22:50.900 --> 00:22:51.980
He says, you know,
a lot of people,

00:22:51.980 --> 00:22:54.010
especially in the new year,
say I want to get fit.

00:22:54.010 --> 00:22:56.051
And then he says, show me
how you spend your time

00:22:56.051 --> 00:22:57.955
and I'll show you what
your priorities are.

00:22:57.955 --> 00:22:59.830
Because most people say,
I'd love to get fit,

00:22:59.830 --> 00:23:02.800
but then they don't go to
the gym, they don't work out.

00:23:02.800 --> 00:23:05.320
And I think it's the
same about what do

00:23:05.320 --> 00:23:06.839
you like to do outside of work.

00:23:06.839 --> 00:23:08.380
Or if you want to
become an engineer,

00:23:08.380 --> 00:23:11.145
are you or are you spending
time towards that thing?

00:23:11.145 --> 00:23:12.520
And if you don't
know what it is,

00:23:12.520 --> 00:23:14.500
I would just say,
OK, take a morning

00:23:14.500 --> 00:23:16.510
and look at what you
did the day before

00:23:16.510 --> 00:23:18.400
and see what got
your attention, where

00:23:18.400 --> 00:23:21.320
you started spending time,
what you were googling on

00:23:21.320 --> 00:23:22.840
after work.

00:23:22.840 --> 00:23:24.970
And I think from there
you start to pull threads.

00:23:24.970 --> 00:23:27.274
But for me, this was never--

00:23:27.274 --> 00:23:29.440
this was a hope that we
could bring the message out.

00:23:29.440 --> 00:23:31.523
But I think "When to Jump"
came out of being like,

00:23:31.523 --> 00:23:33.520
OK, I just want to
collect stories.

00:23:33.520 --> 00:23:36.020
And then from that other
things started to evolve.

00:23:36.020 --> 00:23:38.620
SPEAKER 1: And second question
before I open up to the floor,

00:23:38.620 --> 00:23:42.840
there's a massive nervousness
around that moment

00:23:42.840 --> 00:23:44.590
while you are
deciding to jump right

00:23:44.590 --> 00:23:46.352
through to actually jumping.

00:23:46.352 --> 00:23:47.810
Can you give any
advice to everyone

00:23:47.810 --> 00:23:50.580
who's thinking about a
transition right now?

00:23:50.580 --> 00:23:53.020
Ways to approach
it, mindset to take.

00:23:53.020 --> 00:23:55.480
Do you just go for it or
do you really consider

00:23:55.480 --> 00:23:57.550
it, take three months?

00:23:57.550 --> 00:23:58.792
What's your advice?

00:23:58.792 --> 00:24:01.000
MIKE LEWIS: I don't know if
this is weird to preface,

00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:03.550
but I don't consider
myself a self-help guru

00:24:03.550 --> 00:24:06.720
or qualified to give everybody
advice on their life.

00:24:06.720 --> 00:24:08.710
I think everyone
lives a life that's

00:24:08.710 --> 00:24:11.220
very complicated and
specific to yours.

00:24:11.220 --> 00:24:14.570
And I can only reflect on the
research we've done in the book

00:24:14.570 --> 00:24:18.940
and being lucky to
spend time with people

00:24:18.940 --> 00:24:21.940
who have taken the steps
to think through their job.

00:24:21.940 --> 00:24:24.700
For me it's how the
book's organized.

00:24:24.700 --> 00:24:28.390
So there's four
phases that it seems

00:24:28.390 --> 00:24:32.230
like anyone goes through when
they make a jump in their life.

00:24:32.230 --> 00:24:34.225
The first is listening
to that little voice.

00:24:34.225 --> 00:24:36.100
The second one is making
a plan, which is, I,

00:24:36.100 --> 00:24:41.290
think the bulk of it,
these 10,000 unsexy steps.

00:24:41.290 --> 00:24:44.110
That includes kind of sewing a
safety net in your current job,

00:24:44.110 --> 00:24:46.450
especially if you're
looking to move internally.

00:24:46.450 --> 00:24:49.302
It seems like doing the job
you're doing really well

00:24:49.302 --> 00:24:51.010
and getting a lot of
support around that,

00:24:51.010 --> 00:24:58.640
building a good reputation is
a good foundation to jump from.

00:24:58.640 --> 00:25:01.114
And then there's letting
yourself be lucky.

00:25:01.114 --> 00:25:02.780
So once you've actually
planned the jump

00:25:02.780 --> 00:25:05.960
and you've solved for
all you can solve--

00:25:05.960 --> 00:25:08.422
I don't think there's
ever a perfect time to go,

00:25:08.422 --> 00:25:10.130
but I think you've
set yourself up to run

00:25:10.130 --> 00:25:12.742
into fortuitous opportunities.

00:25:12.742 --> 00:25:15.200
And I think that's probably my
favorite section of the book

00:25:15.200 --> 00:25:17.730
is hearing about people
who just trusted your gut.

00:25:17.730 --> 00:25:19.800
And that's, by the
way, really hard.

00:25:19.800 --> 00:25:22.400
But I think, to your
question, if you

00:25:22.400 --> 00:25:25.310
do the other things, by
the time you actually jump,

00:25:25.310 --> 00:25:26.750
there isn't as
much of a downside.

00:25:26.750 --> 00:25:27.575
SPEAKER 1: OK.

00:25:27.575 --> 00:25:28.283
MIKE LEWIS: Yeah.

00:25:28.283 --> 00:25:29.230
SPEAKER 1: Thank you.

00:25:29.230 --> 00:25:30.729
Would anyone like
to ask a question?

00:25:35.610 --> 00:25:37.140
AUDIENCE: It's a
very open question.

00:25:37.140 --> 00:25:37.590
MIKE LEWIS: Cool.

00:25:37.590 --> 00:25:38.950
I'll give a really open answer.

00:25:38.950 --> 00:25:41.010
AUDIENCE: It's
like, what's your--

00:25:41.010 --> 00:25:44.130
I have read many books and
they're mostly for Americans.

00:25:44.130 --> 00:25:45.927
And when you try to
apply them in UK,

00:25:45.927 --> 00:25:47.010
it sometimes doesn't work.

00:25:47.010 --> 00:25:48.630
It mostly doesn't work.

00:25:48.630 --> 00:25:51.620
So since you've been around,
you've been in New Zealand,

00:25:51.620 --> 00:25:55.140
et cetera, how do we
localize stuff from your book

00:25:55.140 --> 00:25:56.262
or what we read around?

00:25:56.262 --> 00:25:56.970
MIKE LEWIS: Yeah.

00:25:56.970 --> 00:26:01.200
So The book has 44 stories
that represent, I don't think,

00:26:01.200 --> 00:26:04.394
the viewpoint of
one nationality.

00:26:04.394 --> 00:26:06.060
There's a really
strong immigrant thread

00:26:06.060 --> 00:26:08.820
through the book,
from Chinese-Americans

00:26:08.820 --> 00:26:11.640
to El Salvadorians to Nigerians.

00:26:11.640 --> 00:26:14.280
We have several folks in the
book from the United Kingdom.

00:26:14.280 --> 00:26:16.238
And then we have people
in the book that I just

00:26:16.238 --> 00:26:18.510
met while I was traveling,
people from New Zealand

00:26:18.510 --> 00:26:23.180
through Asia, and here in
the-- or there in the States.

00:26:23.180 --> 00:26:25.680
What I find really interesting--
maybe this isn't the answer

00:26:25.680 --> 00:26:26.346
to the question.

00:26:26.346 --> 00:26:28.980
But I think that
there's something

00:26:28.980 --> 00:26:33.920
fundamental to how you think
about what you do everyday.

00:26:33.920 --> 00:26:36.850
I think we constantly,
as humans--

00:26:36.850 --> 00:26:39.190
it's part of being human,
wondering is this the way

00:26:39.190 --> 00:26:41.380
it's supposed to be
spending my time.

00:26:41.380 --> 00:26:44.130
I think that's the core of
the book is not so much, oh,

00:26:44.130 --> 00:26:48.140
jump because it's a cultural
thing or you're a millennial.

00:26:48.140 --> 00:26:51.140
We have a woman who's 67
years old who's in the book.

00:26:51.140 --> 00:26:52.860
We have a single mom in Boston.

00:26:52.860 --> 00:26:57.370
We have an Indian
woman in Guilford.

00:26:57.370 --> 00:27:01.300
The powerful part to me is that,
given all of the disparities,

00:27:01.300 --> 00:27:05.080
there's just fundamental truths
that come out of this idea

00:27:05.080 --> 00:27:08.180
that we think about.

00:27:08.180 --> 00:27:09.774
And maybe it won't--

00:27:09.774 --> 00:27:12.065
it's actually-- I mean, it's
going great in the States.

00:27:12.065 --> 00:27:14.106
But we've had an amazing
reception here, I think,

00:27:14.106 --> 00:27:16.790
because maybe there isn't
as much of a conversation

00:27:16.790 --> 00:27:19.280
openly about going off the path.

00:27:19.280 --> 00:27:22.760
We did an event with Lululemon
and one of the panelists

00:27:22.760 --> 00:27:26.120
was this Indian woman from
Guilford who is in a career

00:27:26.120 --> 00:27:28.040
and worked in
fashion on the side

00:27:28.040 --> 00:27:30.382
and ended up going
into current fashion.

00:27:30.382 --> 00:27:32.840
And we spent most of the time
talking about British culture

00:27:32.840 --> 00:27:34.809
and traditional cultures,
where that's not

00:27:34.809 --> 00:27:37.100
what your parents did, that's
not what your friends are

00:27:37.100 --> 00:27:39.680
doing, what that means if
you're culturally not supposed

00:27:39.680 --> 00:27:40.740
to do that.

00:27:40.740 --> 00:27:46.310
So I think we do a decent job of
sharing those types of stories.

00:27:46.310 --> 00:27:48.650
We also have these
festivals where we

00:27:48.650 --> 00:27:50.450
try to go into different areas.

00:27:50.450 --> 00:27:53.210
London will be our first
one this September.

00:27:53.210 --> 00:27:54.200
Abby's with me.

00:27:54.200 --> 00:27:55.340
She's our event director.

00:27:55.340 --> 00:27:56.450
She's back there.

00:27:56.450 --> 00:27:58.760
If you're interested
in being a part of it,

00:27:58.760 --> 00:28:01.460
or if you think there's things
we should know as we plan it,

00:28:01.460 --> 00:28:03.290
I'd be thrilled,
because we're spending

00:28:03.290 --> 00:28:04.425
this week getting going.

00:28:04.425 --> 00:28:07.050
And we also want to do something
special for everyone at Google

00:28:07.050 --> 00:28:08.711
if they end up wanting to come.

00:28:08.711 --> 00:28:11.210
But I think it's important to
go there and learn the stories

00:28:11.210 --> 00:28:11.751
and be there.

00:28:11.751 --> 00:28:13.460
And I was lucky
that squash gave me

00:28:13.460 --> 00:28:16.280
that kind of excuse to sit
down and have thousands

00:28:16.280 --> 00:28:17.240
of these conversations.

00:28:17.240 --> 00:28:19.240
But I'm sure there's
stuff we're missing,

00:28:19.240 --> 00:28:20.800
and maybe that's
for the next book.

00:28:20.800 --> 00:28:21.341
I don't know.

00:28:25.450 --> 00:28:26.900
And by the way,
as we pass it on,

00:28:26.900 --> 00:28:30.750
my email-- if you just
email info@whentojump.com,

00:28:30.750 --> 00:28:33.630
that goes to our platform,
which I can promise you

00:28:33.630 --> 00:28:36.862
will come to me
almost immediately.

00:28:36.862 --> 00:28:38.820
And just say you want
info on the London event,

00:28:38.820 --> 00:28:41.100
and we'll make sure
you're on the list.

00:28:41.100 --> 00:28:46.110
And Abby's email's just
A-B-B-Y @ whentojump.com.

00:28:46.110 --> 00:28:47.850
But truly, this is
day two of thinking

00:28:47.850 --> 00:28:49.225
about what we'll
do in September,

00:28:49.225 --> 00:28:52.357
so welcome all
ideas and feedback.

00:28:52.357 --> 00:28:53.940
AUDIENCE: I have two
questions in one.

00:28:53.940 --> 00:28:54.523
Is it working?

00:28:54.523 --> 00:28:55.470
MIKE LEWIS: Yeah.

00:28:55.470 --> 00:28:57.636
AUDIENCE: So the name of
the book is "When to Jump,"

00:28:57.636 --> 00:29:01.060
not "If to Jump," so it kind
of implies a positive outcome.

00:29:01.060 --> 00:29:02.640
So is it really always positive?

00:29:02.640 --> 00:29:04.980
And I'm assuming that the
44 stories in the book,

00:29:04.980 --> 00:29:07.330
since they made it to
the book, are positive.

00:29:07.330 --> 00:29:10.350
So what is the most blissful
failure you've seen?

00:29:10.350 --> 00:29:13.920
And what do you actually define
as a failure in this case?

00:29:13.920 --> 00:29:17.050
MIKE LEWIS: So your
assumption's actually incorrect,

00:29:17.050 --> 00:29:19.530
which is, I think, a good thing.

00:29:19.530 --> 00:29:22.464
The fourth phase of this jump
curve is don't look back,

00:29:22.464 --> 00:29:23.880
and that's kind
of code for being,

00:29:23.880 --> 00:29:28.050
like, the stories that didn't
really go the way they thought.

00:29:28.050 --> 00:29:29.790
And I think that's
important because it'd

00:29:29.790 --> 00:29:31.950
be a little weird to
just show you 44 stories

00:29:31.950 --> 00:29:34.929
where it just all was
exactly as planned.

00:29:34.929 --> 00:29:37.470
We have both internal jumps that
kind of didn't go as planned

00:29:37.470 --> 00:29:40.540
as well as people who took a
big risk and it didn't work out.

00:29:43.190 --> 00:29:46.460
To me-- and again, maybe this
is just super optimistic.

00:29:46.460 --> 00:29:48.710
But from every
conversation I've had

00:29:48.710 --> 00:29:52.490
since five years ago talking
to that cyclist, the people who

00:29:52.490 --> 00:29:56.510
took the time to take that
middle ground of planning

00:29:56.510 --> 00:29:59.960
and thinking and budgeting,
all the stuff that's really not

00:29:59.960 --> 00:30:02.930
that riveting to talk
about or share on Facebook

00:30:02.930 --> 00:30:04.850
and all that stuff,
if you went and did

00:30:04.850 --> 00:30:09.260
that, those people who ended up
you jumped in it didn't really

00:30:09.260 --> 00:30:12.234
work out, it led them to
something else that might still

00:30:12.234 --> 00:30:13.775
be working but is
getting them closer

00:30:13.775 --> 00:30:15.200
to what they want to be doing.

00:30:15.200 --> 00:30:17.060
So no one that I've
talked to who's

00:30:17.060 --> 00:30:20.000
followed this framework,
if you will, these phases,

00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:22.460
has regretted the decision.

00:30:22.460 --> 00:30:24.740
And in fact, when I
was taking the jump,

00:30:24.740 --> 00:30:27.290
I sought out people who
just fell on their face,

00:30:27.290 --> 00:30:29.485
jumped and nothing worked.

00:30:29.485 --> 00:30:31.610
And they were the biggest
advocates and the loudest

00:30:31.610 --> 00:30:32.780
cheerleaders.

00:30:32.780 --> 00:30:36.140
And I would challenge you to
do the same if you're thinking

00:30:36.140 --> 00:30:38.089
about "if" rather than "when."

00:30:38.089 --> 00:30:39.630
Like, talk to the
people who I call--

00:30:39.630 --> 00:30:41.671
there's three types of
people you should talk to.

00:30:41.671 --> 00:30:45.380
One, a Switzerland,
who has no total bias

00:30:45.380 --> 00:30:47.400
in one way or the other,
like not the person who

00:30:47.400 --> 00:30:50.150
is the massive jumper
and not your parents who

00:30:50.150 --> 00:30:53.780
really don't want you to
do it, but Switzerland.

00:30:53.780 --> 00:30:57.140
And then find the
missed, which is

00:30:57.140 --> 00:30:59.805
the person who missed the
opportunity and didn't jump.

00:30:59.805 --> 00:31:02.180
Because that's another theme
is, if you really want to go

00:31:02.180 --> 00:31:04.763
do what you're doing and you're
worried about if you should do

00:31:04.763 --> 00:31:07.550
it, talk to the people who
missed that chance because that

00:31:07.550 --> 00:31:09.730
will probably get you going.

00:31:09.730 --> 00:31:11.340
And then three
would be the oops,

00:31:11.340 --> 00:31:15.390
which is the person who's jump
didn't exactly go as planned.

00:31:15.390 --> 00:31:19.080
And I would say that that
would be a first easy exercise,

00:31:19.080 --> 00:31:22.090
to just find those types
of people, the three folks,

00:31:22.090 --> 00:31:23.340
and see what they have to say.

00:31:23.340 --> 00:31:25.060
Because I think
you'd be surprised.

00:31:25.060 --> 00:31:27.240
I think the human
psyche is one where

00:31:27.240 --> 00:31:30.180
we go to the worst
possible place in our mind

00:31:30.180 --> 00:31:32.062
and that's not always very fair.

00:31:32.062 --> 00:31:32.770
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:31:38.674 --> 00:31:40.150
AUDIENCE: Hey.

00:31:40.150 --> 00:31:43.360
So I think a lot of people
at different organizations

00:31:43.360 --> 00:31:46.880
in society were encouraged
to focus on our strengths.

00:31:46.880 --> 00:31:48.550
And I think it's
easier to make a jump

00:31:48.550 --> 00:31:51.070
if you're going from
strength to another strength.

00:31:51.070 --> 00:31:54.580
But in the case of if you want
to go from eh to something

00:31:54.580 --> 00:31:56.410
that you were weak
at, like I'm thinking

00:31:56.410 --> 00:31:58.150
when you said you were--

00:31:58.150 --> 00:31:59.770
when you jumped to squash.

00:31:59.770 --> 00:32:03.490
Like, it's not something
that you were strong at.

00:32:03.490 --> 00:32:05.637
Just advice between the
two different jumps,

00:32:05.637 --> 00:32:07.720
something that you're
strong at and then something

00:32:07.720 --> 00:32:08.740
that you're weak at.

00:32:08.740 --> 00:32:10.095
MIKE LEWIS: Yeah.

00:32:10.095 --> 00:32:11.470
There's a great--
there's a story

00:32:11.470 --> 00:32:13.720
in the book about a
woman who was at LinkedIn

00:32:13.720 --> 00:32:16.870
and jumped internally from
a research role to sales.

00:32:16.870 --> 00:32:19.110
And she really it was
not a sales person,

00:32:19.110 --> 00:32:22.210
had studied hard core
analytics in school

00:32:22.210 --> 00:32:24.190
but had always wanted
to work with people

00:32:24.190 --> 00:32:25.840
on the external side.

00:32:25.840 --> 00:32:29.410
And I think it comes down
again to being like who's

00:32:29.410 --> 00:32:31.600
doing the thing that
I want to be doing,

00:32:31.600 --> 00:32:34.750
and will they let me have
30 minutes with them.

00:32:34.750 --> 00:32:36.790
Can I buy them a cup of coffee?

00:32:36.790 --> 00:32:39.400
And just going at
that weakness until--

00:32:39.400 --> 00:32:40.400
and this sounds cliche--

00:32:40.400 --> 00:32:42.899
but until that becomes the thing
that you feel like you know

00:32:42.899 --> 00:32:44.480
better than your current job.

00:32:44.480 --> 00:32:46.930
And I think the hard part, at
least it was for me at Bain

00:32:46.930 --> 00:32:48.304
and maybe for you
guys at Google,

00:32:48.304 --> 00:32:50.830
is once you get in that
spot where you feel really

00:32:50.830 --> 00:32:53.740
like you know how everything
works, it almost--

00:32:53.740 --> 00:32:55.930
it's like an all
or nothing thing.

00:32:55.930 --> 00:32:58.180
It's like I can't leave this
because then I won't know

00:32:58.180 --> 00:32:59.740
anything about the other thing.

00:32:59.740 --> 00:33:03.250
And if you can always be
on that edge of your seat,

00:33:03.250 --> 00:33:05.490
even if you're doing for
eight hours a day the thing

00:33:05.490 --> 00:33:07.000
we're supposed to
do, but at lunch

00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:09.310
you go take a
programming course or you

00:33:09.310 --> 00:33:11.590
talk to the person who's
doing what you want.

00:33:11.590 --> 00:33:14.890
That stuff, I think, if you
feel like it gets into a routine

00:33:14.890 --> 00:33:18.490
and it's like there's a
circularity to your day

00:33:18.490 --> 00:33:20.740
in your job, I think
that's like a signal

00:33:20.740 --> 00:33:24.850
that you're coasting maybe
more than you probably want to.

00:33:24.850 --> 00:33:26.390
But maybe that's
what you need, too.

00:33:26.390 --> 00:33:28.450
Like, there's a spectrum of--

00:33:28.450 --> 00:33:30.370
I think the jump curve
is like a spectrum.

00:33:30.370 --> 00:33:33.730
If you've just had a
third child or you've

00:33:33.730 --> 00:33:36.680
got student debts to
pay back or a mortgage,

00:33:36.680 --> 00:33:40.016
I wouldn't say that you
need to jump just then.

00:33:40.016 --> 00:33:42.390
But you can be having those
chats of what you want to do,

00:33:42.390 --> 00:33:43.130
you can be planning.

00:33:43.130 --> 00:33:45.546
And then at some point there
will be opportunity, I think,

00:33:45.546 --> 00:33:46.210
to do it.

00:33:46.210 --> 00:33:48.760
I mean, no one in the
book jumped the next day.

00:33:48.760 --> 00:33:51.140
It was months, if not-- some
people waited two years,

00:33:51.140 --> 00:33:52.665
five years to do it.

00:33:52.665 --> 00:33:54.540
So I know that wasn't
exactly what you asked.

00:33:54.540 --> 00:33:56.340
AUDIENCE: No, I think
it's on the mark.

00:33:56.340 --> 00:33:57.090
MIKE LEWIS: Sweet.

00:33:59.432 --> 00:34:01.098
AUDIENCE: I think I
can do without the--

00:34:01.098 --> 00:34:03.090
MIKE LEWIS: Oh, I think they
need that, though, for the--

00:34:03.090 --> 00:34:04.515
AUDIENCE: Oh, they need it.

00:34:04.515 --> 00:34:06.420
OK.

00:34:06.420 --> 00:34:09.510
Curious to know if-- well,
first of all, thanks.

00:34:09.510 --> 00:34:12.389
Thanks for sharing your story,
very courageous and very

00:34:12.389 --> 00:34:14.190
inspiring.

00:34:14.190 --> 00:34:17.909
I'm curious to know whether,
through the 44 stories that

00:34:17.909 --> 00:34:21.389
are in the book and perhaps the
other stories that didn't make

00:34:21.389 --> 00:34:26.790
it, did you find any common
traits in the personality

00:34:26.790 --> 00:34:29.520
of people, would
you say, if they

00:34:29.520 --> 00:34:30.900
had a couple of things common.

00:34:30.900 --> 00:34:33.030
People talk about
the whole range,

00:34:33.030 --> 00:34:37.560
you know, discipline,
visionary, whatever.

00:34:37.560 --> 00:34:41.676
I wonder if you picked on
any commonality across.

00:34:41.676 --> 00:34:43.050
MIKE LEWIS: To be
honest, I think

00:34:43.050 --> 00:34:46.800
that my whole thesis with
the book and what I feel

00:34:46.800 --> 00:34:50.429
drives me to do this is that
I think we tend to just find

00:34:50.429 --> 00:34:54.000
these buzzwords, and we feel
like we have to only give them

00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:54.625
to some people.

00:34:54.625 --> 00:34:56.416
And then we feel like
the other people just

00:34:56.416 --> 00:34:57.810
weren't born with those traits.

00:34:57.810 --> 00:35:00.120
And the whole point of
this book and the community

00:35:00.120 --> 00:35:03.660
is that we celebrate the
person you walk by in the tube

00:35:03.660 --> 00:35:06.540
or going for coffee,
and their jump.

00:35:06.540 --> 00:35:08.040
And I actually think
there's nothing

00:35:08.040 --> 00:35:11.670
that the people have in
common, except for this feeling

00:35:11.670 --> 00:35:13.140
that as you get
a little bit more

00:35:13.140 --> 00:35:15.540
into thinking of
what you want to do,

00:35:15.540 --> 00:35:18.480
this equation starts to go
unbalanced, where it goes

00:35:18.480 --> 00:35:21.030
from well, it could be
really bad if I did it

00:35:21.030 --> 00:35:24.690
and it's not worth
doing it to saying,

00:35:24.690 --> 00:35:28.130
OK, there's a worst
case scenario of going

00:35:28.130 --> 00:35:29.910
and that's terrifying.

00:35:29.910 --> 00:35:32.160
But each of the people in
the book would show you,

00:35:32.160 --> 00:35:34.800
and in their stories
you'll see, that idea

00:35:34.800 --> 00:35:39.440
of not trying ultimately
is way more terrifying.

00:35:39.440 --> 00:35:43.950
So I don't think there's
like a special super power.

00:35:43.950 --> 00:35:46.350
I think it's this realization
of if you peel back

00:35:46.350 --> 00:35:49.479
the layers, at some point you're
going to see this worst case

00:35:49.479 --> 00:35:51.270
scenario isn't as bad,
especially if you're

00:35:51.270 --> 00:35:52.200
a place like Google.

00:35:52.200 --> 00:35:54.480
And if you end up
jumping outside of Google

00:35:54.480 --> 00:35:55.650
don't blame me.

00:35:55.650 --> 00:35:56.970
You can if you want.

00:35:56.970 --> 00:35:58.590
But I think that it
goes for anything.

00:35:58.590 --> 00:36:00.900
Like if you want to change
jobs within the company,

00:36:00.900 --> 00:36:03.840
there's so much more at stake
for them to keep you and find

00:36:03.840 --> 00:36:05.460
the right role
for you, and maybe

00:36:05.460 --> 00:36:07.230
if it doesn't work,
find a different role,

00:36:07.230 --> 00:36:11.390
than to go outside and take
a chance on a stranger.

00:36:11.390 --> 00:36:14.290
If think of human resources
and human capital,

00:36:14.290 --> 00:36:16.260
you guys made it
into the circle.

00:36:16.260 --> 00:36:19.290
You should feel like you've got
all the launching pad you have

00:36:19.290 --> 00:36:22.710
and all the risk opportunity
to take because you're already

00:36:22.710 --> 00:36:24.994
there.

00:36:24.994 --> 00:36:25.930
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:36:25.930 --> 00:36:27.710
MIKE LEWIS: And
by the way, I wish

00:36:27.710 --> 00:36:29.786
I had a key card
because I would--

00:36:29.786 --> 00:36:31.160
if you're enjoying
the meal, just

00:36:31.160 --> 00:36:35.060
keep going because I really
wish that I had that these days.

00:36:35.060 --> 00:36:37.107
Maybe your 401(k) too.

00:36:37.107 --> 00:36:37.940
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:36:37.940 --> 00:36:39.750
My question was quite
similar to that one,

00:36:39.750 --> 00:36:40.833
but with a bit of a twist.

00:36:40.833 --> 00:36:42.800
So you've spoken
quite a lot about--

00:36:42.800 --> 00:36:44.660
you use the word
risk quite a lot.

00:36:44.660 --> 00:36:48.020
And obviously there's a lot
of conversation about gender

00:36:48.020 --> 00:36:49.790
and men and women
and the differences,

00:36:49.790 --> 00:36:52.640
and I think almost
probably over-discussed.

00:36:52.640 --> 00:36:55.040
But something that everyone's
talking about quite a lot

00:36:55.040 --> 00:36:59.470
is that women are probably just
less inclined to take risks,

00:36:59.470 --> 00:37:00.680
they're more risk-averse.

00:37:00.680 --> 00:37:02.740
And it doesn't sound
like that played out,

00:37:02.740 --> 00:37:05.629
but did you see anything
like that in your research?

00:37:05.629 --> 00:37:08.170
MIKE LEWIS: So the second story
in the book-- the first story

00:37:08.170 --> 00:37:10.880
is about a karate school manager
who wanted to be a screenwriter

00:37:10.880 --> 00:37:13.730
and failed a bunch of times,
and then tried one more time

00:37:13.730 --> 00:37:16.320
and he ended up writing
"Sleepless in Seattle."

00:37:16.320 --> 00:37:20.510
And then the second story is of
a 44-year-old woman and mother,

00:37:20.510 --> 00:37:26.030
single mother, who left her job
as a nurse to become a doctor.

00:37:26.030 --> 00:37:27.740
And I think in her
story, it definitely

00:37:27.740 --> 00:37:31.490
reflects the unique
challenges that women

00:37:31.490 --> 00:37:34.859
face different than
men in taking a jump.

00:37:34.859 --> 00:37:37.400
She was told early on that she
wasn't the type of person that

00:37:37.400 --> 00:37:39.410
could go to college.

00:37:39.410 --> 00:37:41.900
She then had a child and
had to care for the child,

00:37:41.900 --> 00:37:44.390
and couldn't do both
as a single parent.

00:37:44.390 --> 00:37:45.542
So I think there are--

00:37:45.542 --> 00:37:46.500
and I'm not the expert.

00:37:46.500 --> 00:37:49.940
I would say speak to
women who have jumped.

00:37:49.940 --> 00:37:52.820
But from the data,
it's just seems

00:37:52.820 --> 00:37:56.540
like there are obstacles,
not insurmountable ones,

00:37:56.540 --> 00:37:58.820
but obstacles you
have to feel like,

00:37:58.820 --> 00:38:01.800
OK, I know what I'm going
to have to overcome.

00:38:01.800 --> 00:38:05.510
But I don't think it's
as, again, as literal

00:38:05.510 --> 00:38:08.870
and is tactically challenging
as we may make it seem.

00:38:08.870 --> 00:38:10.740
And there's women
in the book who

00:38:10.740 --> 00:38:14.120
jumped with kids, who jumped
going through a divorce, who

00:38:14.120 --> 00:38:16.580
jumped planning
to have a family,

00:38:16.580 --> 00:38:18.800
like things that you think
would be kind of end all,

00:38:18.800 --> 00:38:21.230
be all stopping jumps.

00:38:21.230 --> 00:38:23.040
And they were able to do it.

00:38:23.040 --> 00:38:25.020
So there's a bunch
more in the book

00:38:25.020 --> 00:38:26.840
of how they went
and did that, but I

00:38:26.840 --> 00:38:30.560
would say it's not as
insurmountable as it may seem.

00:38:30.560 --> 00:38:32.960
And our audience, by the way,
and community members are--

00:38:32.960 --> 00:38:36.060
more than half are
women who have jumped.

00:38:38.644 --> 00:38:39.810
AUDIENCE: I have a question.

00:38:39.810 --> 00:38:42.460
How did you get the
Olympian's number?

00:38:42.460 --> 00:38:43.960
MIKE LEWIS: That's
a great question.

00:38:43.960 --> 00:38:44.910
No one's asked that.

00:38:44.910 --> 00:38:45.645
AUDIENCE: Well, I noticed.

00:38:45.645 --> 00:38:46.610
I was like, I'm going to wait--

00:38:46.610 --> 00:38:46.900
MIKE LEWIS: No.

00:38:46.900 --> 00:38:48.250
No one's asked that ever before.

00:38:48.250 --> 00:38:49.125
AUDIENCE: Oh, really?

00:38:49.125 --> 00:38:49.702
OK, but yeah.

00:38:49.702 --> 00:38:50.410
I'd like to know.

00:38:50.410 --> 00:38:51.120
Thanks.

00:38:51.120 --> 00:38:53.328
MIKE LEWIS: I have a really
funny side story to that,

00:38:53.328 --> 00:38:55.860
too, that I feel like
I should just tell.

00:38:55.860 --> 00:38:59.160
So had she went to a
university and then I

00:38:59.160 --> 00:39:02.490
had a friend who knew a friend
of hers, because they were--

00:39:02.490 --> 00:39:04.101
she was five years
ahead of me, which

00:39:04.101 --> 00:39:06.600
is another-- like, the reason
we're making this directory is

00:39:06.600 --> 00:39:08.849
it shouldn't be that difficult.
And I was really lucky

00:39:08.849 --> 00:39:10.300
that I knew somebody.

00:39:10.300 --> 00:39:12.300
But she's someone who
would take anybody's call.

00:39:12.300 --> 00:39:14.160
No one had asked her about that.

00:39:14.160 --> 00:39:16.410
When I got to the second
baseman for the Cubs--

00:39:16.410 --> 00:39:17.180
you can Google it.

00:39:17.180 --> 00:39:18.770
He had just done a piece
in "The New Yorker."

00:39:18.770 --> 00:39:20.900
He had just done a piece
in "The New York Times."

00:39:20.900 --> 00:39:23.550
And I was living in Zimbabwe
at the time, Facebook

00:39:23.550 --> 00:39:24.570
messaging him.

00:39:24.570 --> 00:39:26.430
And you guys know when
you're not a Facebook

00:39:26.430 --> 00:39:28.060
friend where those messages go?

00:39:28.060 --> 00:39:29.940
Yeah, to, like, the weird box.

00:39:29.940 --> 00:39:31.610
Like no one should respond.

00:39:31.610 --> 00:39:34.420
It's just not even, I
don't think, a thing.

00:39:34.420 --> 00:39:37.710
And I think I e-mailed him,
like, six times to that inbox.

00:39:37.710 --> 00:39:39.930
And finally he was
like, I want to be

00:39:39.930 --> 00:39:42.544
able to tell this story of
when you shouldn't jump.

00:39:42.544 --> 00:39:44.460
Because he had jumped
at the wrong time and he

00:39:44.460 --> 00:39:47.440
had to go back to baseball
and all these things.

00:39:47.440 --> 00:39:53.614
To tell you the funny
story, we started

00:39:53.614 --> 00:39:56.030
partnering with Soul Cycle,
which I know is in the States,

00:39:56.030 --> 00:39:56.610
not here.

00:39:56.610 --> 00:39:58.380
But it's like the
spinning, whatever.

00:39:58.380 --> 00:40:00.580
And when I came back
to the US, and we

00:40:00.580 --> 00:40:01.300
starting working
with Soul Cycle,

00:40:01.300 --> 00:40:02.424
I tracked down the cyclist.

00:40:02.424 --> 00:40:06.430
And I was like, can we hang out?

00:40:06.430 --> 00:40:07.614
And she was like, yes.

00:40:07.614 --> 00:40:08.280
And I was like--

00:40:08.280 --> 00:40:09.560
I'd mentioned in
passing that we started

00:40:09.560 --> 00:40:10.710
partnering with Soul Cycle.

00:40:10.710 --> 00:40:12.001
She's like, oh, I'd love to go.

00:40:12.001 --> 00:40:12.799
I've never gone.

00:40:12.799 --> 00:40:15.090
And I was like, this is like
a SportsCenter commercial.

00:40:15.090 --> 00:40:17.220
Like here's a woman who's
a two-time Olympian.

00:40:17.220 --> 00:40:18.960
She just finished in Rio.

00:40:18.960 --> 00:40:23.180
And so we go in, and we had
just done a talk with them

00:40:23.180 --> 00:40:24.270
at Soul Cycle.

00:40:24.270 --> 00:40:27.780
And we go into this class,
and I'm next to the Olympian.

00:40:27.780 --> 00:40:30.090
She's fastening her shoes
that she had in Rio.

00:40:30.090 --> 00:40:32.250
And I'm like, don't
freak out, Mike.

00:40:32.250 --> 00:40:34.534
And the instructor's
like, is Mike Lewis here?

00:40:34.534 --> 00:40:35.700
And she's like, is that you?

00:40:35.700 --> 00:40:36.824
And I was like, no, no, no.

00:40:36.824 --> 00:40:37.730
Don't worry about it.

00:40:37.730 --> 00:40:38.392
Not me.

00:40:38.392 --> 00:40:39.600
And they're like, no, no, no.

00:40:39.600 --> 00:40:41.640
We need to all give
Mike Lewis a hand

00:40:41.640 --> 00:40:43.680
for coming in here
because "When to Jump"

00:40:43.680 --> 00:40:45.720
is going to change
everyone's life.

00:40:45.720 --> 00:40:47.610
And everyone had to
give around of applause.

00:40:47.610 --> 00:40:52.090
And she's like,
are you kidding me?

00:40:52.090 --> 00:40:54.420
But she's become a friend.

00:40:54.420 --> 00:40:56.752
First of all, thank you for
Google, to put this on for

00:40:56.752 --> 00:40:57.960
and give a round of applause.

00:40:57.960 --> 00:41:01.170
I really appreciate
you doing this.

00:41:01.170 --> 00:41:03.690
If I don't get to chat today,
if you want to learn more,

00:41:03.690 --> 00:41:07.980
like I said, info@whentojump.com
will get to me.

00:41:07.980 --> 00:41:10.370
We have the directory
and we have the festival.

00:41:10.370 --> 00:41:13.704
Abby is just
A-B-B-Y @whentojump.

00:41:13.704 --> 00:41:15.120
And I really hope
this is helpful.

00:41:15.120 --> 00:41:16.440
I hope it's interesting.

00:41:16.440 --> 00:41:19.430
Tell your friends, and
thanks so much for coming.
