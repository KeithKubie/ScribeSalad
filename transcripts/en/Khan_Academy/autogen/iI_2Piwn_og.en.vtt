00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.450
 . 

00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:03.730
 Now I want to solve the variants containing 

00:00:03.730 --> 00:00:05.550
 Absolute values 

00:00:05.550 --> 00:00:08.900
 If there is a subject in algebra it confuses 

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:10.260
 People are very much a subject 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:12.890
 But if we keep directly what 

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:15.620
 It means absolute value, I think you will find it 

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:16.650
 Not so bad 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:20.810
 Let's start with a simple warm-up issue 

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:27.370
 Let's start with | x | &lt;12 

00:00:27.370 --> 00:00:28.740
 Remember what I told you about 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:30.420
 The meaning of absolute value 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:33.890
 It means distance from zero 

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:37.390
 If the first method is to say: What are all x values ​​that are 

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:41.120
 Is less than 0 by less than 12? 

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:42.370
 Let me draw a line of numbers 

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:45.490
 Let me draw a line of numbers 

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:49.120
 If it 's zero here, we turned to all setups 

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:52.100
 From zero to less than 12, well, you can turn 

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:56.570
 To positive 12, you can turn to -12 

00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:02.820
 Anything between these two numbers will be 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:06.360
 Absolute value less than 12 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:10.550
 Its distance from zero will be less than 12 

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:15.020
 If you can say, these can be all setup 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:19.310
 So that x is -12 

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:26.220
 No doubt those numbers will be worth less absolute 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:31.050
 Of 12, as long as it is also - and x must 

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:33.520
 Be less than 12 

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:37.170
 If X touches any of these restrictions, it will be 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:39.890
 Its absolute value is less than 12 without a doubt 

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:42.050
 As you know, when you take the absolute value of -6 

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:43.860
 It is less than zero 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.670
 | -11 Is less than zero by 11 

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:49.520
 If anything achieves both of these limitations conditions 

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:50.630
 Will achieve this equation 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:52.440
 In fact, we have solved it, because this is about 

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:53.810
 Equation of one step 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:56.670
 But I think it's a good foundation for the following examples 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:59.030
 I can write it like this 

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:02.280
 In this space everything will be between 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:06.880
 12 - and does not include those numbers 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:10.690
 Or we can write it like this, x &lt;12 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:13.100
 &gt; -12 

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:15.180
 This is the solution set 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:18.420
 Now let's solve more complex examples 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:21.340
 Let us think a little harder 

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:28.480
 So let's assume that we have | 7x | 

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:31.260
 &gt; = 21 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:33.710
 So let's not think about what is inside 

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:36.020
 Now the absolute value code 

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:38.180
 So that the absolute value is anything 

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:41.260
 Greater than or equal to 21, what does this mean? 

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:44.040
 It means that whatever exists within the absolute value code 

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:47.640
 Whatever exists within our absolute value code 

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:52.840
 It must be less than zero by 21 or more 

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:54.910
 Let me draw a line of numbers 

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:57.010
 In fact, you should imagine a line when setting up 

00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:58.970
 Do this, so you will never get upset 

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:01.660
 You should not save any rule 

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:03.860
 So let's put a zero here 

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:08.980
 Let us appoint Mojib 21, and appoint 21 here 

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:12.470
 We want all the numbers, whatever that is 

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:17.400
 Values ​​will be greater than or equal to 21 

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:20.860
 It is far from zero by more than 21 

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:23.920
 Their absolute values ​​are greater than 21 

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:27.000
 Well, all these negative numbers are less than 

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.090
 -21, when we take absolute values, when 

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:33.750
 We get rid of negative sign, or when we find 

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:37.160
 After zero, they will be greater than 21 

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:39.110
 If you take an absolute value of -30, they will 

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:40.900
 Will be greater than 21 

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:47.070
 Here too, anything larger than positive 21 

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:50.440
 Its absolute value will be greater than 21 as well 

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:54.160
 If we can say that 7x must equal one of the 

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:58.530
 These numbers, or that 7x should equal one of these 

00:03:58.530 --> 00:03:59.930
 The numbers are here 

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:06.230
 If we can write that 7X must be one of these numbers 

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:07.580
 Well, what are these numbers? 

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:10.810
 These are all numbers that are less than or equal to 

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:20.070
 21, or 7x - let me use a different color here - or that's 7x 

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:22.160
 It must be one of these numbers 

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:26.290
 This means that 7x must be greater than or equal to 

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:28.070
 Positive 21 

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:29.870
 I really want you to understand 

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:31.460
 What's happening here 

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:34.590
 If the absolute value is greater than or equal to 21 

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:38.480
 This means that what is inside the absolute value code must be 

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:42.370
 Either greater than positive 21 

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:45.070
 Or less than -21 

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:47.170
 Because if it is less than -21, when you take 

00:04:47.170 --> 00:04:51.110
 Its absolute value, beyond zero, will be more than 21 

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:52.090
 I hope this makes sense 

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:54.120
 We will solve more exercise issues, because it is 

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:56.190
 Stabilize in your brain 

00:04:56.190 --> 00:04:58.650
 But once you master them, these become 

00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:01.960
 Differentiated vehicle, we divide the two ends of this equation on 

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:08.130
 7, and we get x &lt;= -3 

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:12.590
 Or divide the two sides on 7, we get x 

00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:14.710
 &gt; = 3 

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:15.520
 I want to be very clear 

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:17.920
 This, whatever I drew here, was not the solution 

00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:21.070
 It even has to be equal to 7x 

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:23.470
 I wanted you to imagine what it meant to be 

00:05:23.470 --> 00:05:27.460
 The absolute value is greater than 21, ie 

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:30.470
 Is far from zero by more than 21 

00:05:30.470 --> 00:05:33.950
 This is a set solution, x must be larger than or 

00:05:33.950 --> 00:05:37.570
 Equal to 3, or less than or equal to -3 

00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:43.370
 If you set the solution to this equation - let me draw 

00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:49.870
 Line numbers - let's assume that zero, and those 3, these are 

00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:54.365
 -3, the x must either be greater than or equal to 3 

00:05:54.365 --> 00:05:58.410
 Greater than or equal to 3 

00:05:58.410 --> 00:05:59.620
 That is the sign of equality 

00:05:59.620 --> 00:06:02.000
 Or less than or equal to -3 

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:08.210
 Or less than or equal to -3 

00:06:08.210 --> 00:06:08.960
 We're done 

00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:10.500
 Let us solve more of these examples 

00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:13.520
 It's annoying to think, but if 

00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:17.490
 Began to realize the core of absolute value, they 

00:06:17.490 --> 00:06:19.930
 Will become intuitive 

00:06:19.930 --> 00:06:23.840
 So let's assume that we have absolute value - let me 

00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:24.570
 I put a good example - 

00:06:24.570 --> 00:06:32.310
 Let's say &lt;5x + 3 &lt;7 

00:06:32.310 --> 00:06:34.780
 If this tells us that whatever it is inside 

00:06:34.780 --> 00:06:40.030
 The absolute value code, after which the zero must be less than 7 

00:06:40.030 --> 00:06:43.360
 If the roads have a distance of less than 7, then call me 

00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:47.770
 Draw a line setting - if the methods can be zero from zero in 

00:06:47.770 --> 00:06:52.870
 7, can be less than 7, bigger than 

00:06:52.870 --> 00:06:54.740
 7 

00:06:54.740 --> 00:06:54.910
 is not it? 

00:06:54.910 --> 00:06:56.970
 We must be in these limits 

00:06:56.970 --> 00:07:00.240
 And even achieve what exists in the absolute value code 

00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:03.590
 It must be - the thing inside the absolute value symbol 

00:07:03.590 --> 00:07:07.170
 It is 5x + 3 - it must be bigger than 

00:07:07.170 --> 00:07:16.310
 7. It must be less than 7, in order 

00:07:16.310 --> 00:07:19.060
 The absolute value shall be less than 7 

00:07:19.060 --> 00:07:23.680
 If 5x + 3 resides somewhere here 

00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:26.810
 Its absolute value, ie beyond zero 

00:07:26.810 --> 00:07:28.420
 Will be less than 7 

00:07:28.420 --> 00:07:30.270
 And then we can solve it 

00:07:30.270 --> 00:07:32.810
 We subtract 3 from both parties 

00:07:32.810 --> 00:07:36.160
 5x&gt; -10 

00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:40.010
 Divide both ends on 5, and become x&gt; -2 

00:07:40.010 --> 00:07:42.200
 Now here, we subtract 3 from both parties 

00:07:42.200 --> 00:07:45.960
 5x &lt;4 

00:07:45.960 --> 00:07:51.300
 Divide both ends on 5, and get x &lt;4/5 

00:07:51.300 --> 00:07:53.560
 And then we can draw vinegar group 

00:07:53.560 --> 00:07:58.270
 It should be bigger than -2, not larger than 

00:07:58.270 --> 00:08:01.120
 Or equal, and less than 4/5 

00:08:01.120 --> 00:08:03.230
 Maybe this sounds like a conduit, but it's also 

00:08:03.230 --> 00:08:05.590
 A space separator, if we say all x values ​​that fall between 

00:08:05.590 --> 00:08:07.770
 2 and 4/5 

00:08:07.770 --> 00:08:10.780
 Or we can write all the x values ​​that are larger than 

00:08:10.780 --> 00:08:15.140
 -2 and less than 4/5 

00:08:15.140 --> 00:08:19.160
 These are the x values ​​that achieve this equation 

00:08:19.160 --> 00:08:20.810
 In fact, I want you to understand this 

00:08:20.810 --> 00:08:22.110
 By visualization 

00:08:22.110 --> 00:08:28.830
 Now, maybe you are seeing a rule here 

00:08:28.830 --> 00:08:31.110
 I do not want you to keep it, but I will give it 

00:08:31.110 --> 00:08:32.590
 If you want it 

00:08:32.590 --> 00:08:36.809
 If you have something like f (x), the absolute value of f (x) 

00:08:36.809 --> 00:08:41.409
 Be less than, let 's assume a number, a 

00:08:41.409 --> 00:08:41.730
 is not it? 

00:08:41.730 --> 00:08:42.600
 This is the case 

00:08:42.600 --> 00:08:44.810
 We have f (x) &lt;a 

00:08:44.810 --> 00:08:48.080
 This means that | f (x |, or f (x) must be 

00:08:48.080 --> 00:08:50.600
 Be less than zero less than a 

00:08:50.600 --> 00:08:56.960
 If this means that (f) x must be less than a positive or 

00:08:56.960 --> 00:08:59.730
 Greater than -a 

00:08:59.730 --> 00:09:05.090
 This translates into that, which translates to (f (x&gt; 

00:09:05.090 --> 00:09:10.460
 -a and f (x) &lt;a 

00:09:10.460 --> 00:09:12.280
 But he came from the same logic 

00:09:12.280 --> 00:09:15.540
 This must be assessed by something that is beyond 

00:09:15.540 --> 00:09:17.380
 Zero is less than a 

00:09:17.380 --> 00:09:20.280
 Now, if we go the other way, that is if we have something 

00:09:20.280 --> 00:09:24.810
 F (x)&gt; a 

00:09:24.810 --> 00:09:28.660
 That means he has to evaluate something 

00:09:28.660 --> 00:09:30.730
 The distance from zero is greater than a 

00:09:30.730 --> 00:09:34.330
 If this means it is either to be f (x 

00:09:34.330 --> 00:09:40.720
 Greater than the positive of a, or that (f) x is less than -a 

00:09:40.720 --> 00:09:40.880
 is not it? 

00:09:40.880 --> 00:09:44.380
 If it is less than -a, it may be -a - 

00:09:44.380 --> 00:09:50.980
 1, or -5 + -a 

00:09:50.980 --> 00:09:52.525
 Then when we take absolute value 

00:09:52.525 --> 00:09:53.730
 Will become a + 5 

00:09:53.730 --> 00:09:56.490
 If its absolute value would be greater than a 

00:09:56.490 --> 00:09:59.300
 I just want to - you can save this if you want, but I do 

00:09:59.300 --> 00:10:01.760
 I really want you to think about this, okay 

00:10:01.760 --> 00:10:05.100
 This must be evaluated to be less than zero below a, this must be 

00:10:05.100 --> 00:10:07.440
 To be beyond zero for more than a 

00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:10.310
 Let's solve another example, because I know it can be 

00:10:10.310 --> 00:10:11.780
 A little confusing 

00:10:11.780 --> 00:10:14.040
 I encourage you to watch this show for many times 

00:10:14.040 --> 00:10:16.490
 If this will help you 

00:10:16.490 --> 00:10:23.020
 Let's assume that we have 2x | - Let me put 

00:10:23.020 --> 00:10:24.040
 Something else here 

00:10:24.040 --> 00:10:25.810
 Let me put a harder example 

00:10:25.810 --> 00:10:31.460
 Let's say it's 2x / 7 + 9 

00:10:31.460 --> 00:10:35.460
 &gt; 5/7 

00:10:35.460 --> 00:10:40.370
 If so, he must evaluate something that is beyond him 

00:10:40.370 --> 00:10:43.090
 Zero is greater than 5/7 

00:10:43.090 --> 00:10:47.610
 If this thing, ie 2x / 7 + 9, can be directly 

00:10:47.610 --> 00:10:49.740
 Bigger than 5/7 

00:10:49.740 --> 00:10:53.220
 Or it can be less than -5/7, because if it is 

00:10:53.220 --> 00:10:56.180
 Less than 5/7, will be its absolute value 

00:10:56.180 --> 00:10:57.840
 Bigger than 5/7 

00:10:57.840 --> 00:11:04.970
 Or that the 2x / 7 + 9 will be less than -5/7 

00:11:04.970 --> 00:11:07.540
 We have encountered this situation here 

00:11:07.540 --> 00:11:10.290
 Then we solve each of these equations 

00:11:10.290 --> 00:11:13.750
 Look if we ask - let us multiply everything by 7 

00:11:13.750 --> 00:11:16.290
 In order to get rid of these denominators 

00:11:16.290 --> 00:11:21.730
 If we hit both sides by 7, we get 2x + 9 

00:11:21.730 --> 00:11:24.800
 × 7 = 63,&gt; 5 

00:11:24.800 --> 00:11:25.750
 Let's do this here too 

00:11:25.750 --> 00:11:32.630
 We will get 2x + 63 &lt;-5 

00:11:32.630 --> 00:11:37.010
 Let's subtract 63 from both ends of this equation, and 

00:11:37.010 --> 00:11:39.200
 We get 2x - let's see 

00:11:39.200 --> 00:11:44.470
 5 - 63 = 58, if 2x&gt; 58 

00:11:44.470 --> 00:11:47.230
 If we put 63 of the two ends of this equation 

00:11:47.230 --> 00:11:59.040
 We will get 2x &lt;-68 

00:11:59.040 --> 00:12:00.345
 I realized I made a mistake here 

00:12:00.345 --> 00:12:04.090
 Subtract 63 from both parties, 5 - 63 = 

00:12:04.090 --> 00:12:05.350
 58 

00:12:05.350 --> 00:12:07.970
 I do not want to make any unintended mistake 

00:12:07.970 --> 00:12:09.420
 And then divide both parties on 2 

00:12:09.420 --> 00:12:12.180
 In this case, we get, x&gt; - you do not have to 

00:12:12.180 --> 00:12:14.910
 To reflect the disparate, because we divide on 

00:12:14.910 --> 00:12:22.440
 Positive number -58 / 2 = -29, or 

00:12:22.440 --> 00:12:29.110
 - Here, if we divided both sides on 2 - or x &lt; 

00:12:29.110 --> 00:12:33.520
 34 

00:12:33.520 --> 00:12:36.180
 68 2 2 = 34 

00:12:36.180 --> 00:12:39.160
 Thus, on the setup line, set this solution 

00:12:39.160 --> 00:12:41.880
 The equation will look like this 

00:12:41.880 --> 00:12:43.470
 That is the setup line 

00:12:43.470 --> 00:12:46.460
 I have -29 

00:12:46.460 --> 00:12:49.890
 I have -34 

00:12:49.890 --> 00:12:53.380
 If the solution is, it can either be greater than 29, and 

00:12:53.380 --> 00:12:58.550
 Greater than or equal to, if greater than 29, that is 

00:12:58.550 --> 00:13:06.470
 Located there, or can be less than -34 

00:13:06.470 --> 00:13:10.410
 If any of these will achieve differentiated absolute value 

00:13:10.410 --> 00:13:11.660
 this is 

00:13:11.660 --> 00:13:12.133
 .
