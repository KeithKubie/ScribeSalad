part of nyu's global network University
 

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:15.470
part of nyu's global network University
the global network university is an

the global network university is an
 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:19.609
the global network university is an
attempt in this technological century to

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:19.619
attempt in this technological century to
 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:24.950
attempt in this technological century to
maintain human community and and the the

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960
maintain human community and and the the
 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:29.000

the time-space barrier by using

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:31.430
the time-space barrier by using
 

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:35.630
the time-space barrier by using
technology to permit connectivity in a

technology to permit connectivity in a
 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:38.209
technology to permit connectivity in a
highly complex organism which is the

highly complex organism which is the
 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:41.979
highly complex organism which is the
global network University so the the

00:00:41.979 --> 00:00:41.989
global network University so the the
 

00:00:41.989 --> 00:00:47.080
global network University so the the
fundamental premise is first that

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:47.090
fundamental premise is first that
 

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:50.119
fundamental premise is first that
technology is highly useful in breaking

technology is highly useful in breaking
that time-space continuum that we can

that time-space continuum that we can
 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.779
that time-space continuum that we can
have a class that's going on

00:00:55.779 --> 00:00:55.789
have a class that's going on
 

00:00:55.789 --> 00:01:00.760

simultaneously in Abu Dhabi and New York
 

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:05.270
simultaneously in Abu Dhabi and New York
so a 9am class in New York is a 5pm

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280
so a 9am class in New York is a 5pm
 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.730
so a 9am class in New York is a 5pm
class in Abu Dhabi turns out to work
