[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:14.190
PAUL SAXMAN: Hello and welcome
to this week's episode of

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:16.120
Google Maps garage.

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:20.630
I'm Paul Saxman and with me this
week is Brendan Kenny.

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:22.850
BRENDAN KENNY: Hi.

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:26.150
PAUL SAXMAN: Mr. Google Maps,
JavaScript extraordinaire.

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:29.940
So this week we're going to talk
about actually using the

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:32.560
Chrome dev tools to actually
accelerate Google Map

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:35.270
development, which is the reason
why we have Brendan on

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:36.840
the show this week.

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:38.840
BRENDAN KENNY: I really
like the dev tools.

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:41.240
PAUL SAXMAN: Yeah and I've
learned a lot of things about

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:43.100
dev tools for Brendan myself.

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:45.690
So still getting warmed up
to the debugger myself.

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:51.710
But a lot of other techniques
that I use specifically for

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:53.320
tweaking visualization.

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:55.450
And so we're going to cover
those a little bit later.

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:58.430
And then Brendan is going to
cover some more of the getting

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:01.540
the map in the appropriate--

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:02.610
BRENDAN KENNY: --state that
you want it to be in.

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:04.209
PAUL SAXMAN: Perfect.

00:01:04.209 --> 00:01:07.110
So with that I'll hand
off to Brendan to

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:08.690
show us the real stuff.

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:09.210
BRENDAN KENNY: Sure.

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:13.020
So I am a big fan of the Chrome
dev tools, but I'll

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:16.060
just note at the start that a
lot of the stuff that I'm

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:19.650
going to show here, you can do
in all the other browser

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:21.270
developer tools to
some extent.

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:24.060
There's always a trade off
between what you can do but a

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:26.960
lot of the major things, they
are all pretty similar.

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:29.360
But we're going to be showing
Chrome dev tools today because

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:31.180
they're really good.

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:34.000
So what we have here
is a Google Map.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.500
And this is just a direct copy
of the map, simple example

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:41.290
that's in the Maps
API v3 example.

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:44.970
It's basically the simplest
map that you can throw

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:49.470
together that just has a div
here, a map campus div, and

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:51.900
throws a map in it
and that's it.

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:55.430
And we're just going to start
with this to take a look at

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:56.390
what we can do.

00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:01.570
So if you've never opened up the
dev tools, you should, and

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:03.000
just get comfortable with it.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.910
I've met a lot of developers
that just feel slightly

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:07.195
uncomfortable getting
to know it.

00:02:07.195 --> 00:02:08.520
It's a new tool.

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:10.750
They might not know it that
well, and so when they open it

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:13.170
up it's like there's too many
options and it's all cluttered

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:14.290
and whatever.

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:15.130
It's intimidating.

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:19.250
And a lot of getting over that
is just using it a lot.

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:24.590
So to start up you come up to
the options and down to tools

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:26.365
and open up the developer
tools.

00:02:26.365 --> 00:02:28.690
PAUL SAXMAN: Or you can remember
that extremely--

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:31.730
BRENDAN KENNY: Yeah, this alien
language, which is just

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:36.040
Command-Shift-I on the Mac and
then Control-Shift-I on--

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:37.820
that's not right.

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:39.520
What is it?

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:40.990
PAUL SAXMAN: I think
it's Left-Shift.

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:41.640
BRENDAN KENNY: It's Option.

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:42.400
That's what it is.

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:44.340
So it's Command-Option-I
and I guess

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:47.380
Control-Alt-I on Windows.

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:47.600
I don't know.

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:48.530
It's muscle memory.

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:50.340
It's in your settings.

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:54.830
So when it opens up, you know
down here it starts in the

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:58.840
elements view and it shows a
live view of the DOM of your

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:01.440
page and CSS on the right.

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:02.680
I don't think we're going
to be doing too

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:04.230
much in here today.

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:06.830
But it's a good place to start,
especially if you're

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:09.730
going back and look at our
earlier Maps API garages, you

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:12.750
can see we gave some tips
for like, my Map is not

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:13.500
showing up at all.

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:16.740
A good place to start
is on this screen.

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:18.545
PAUL SAXMAN: And a quick note
about the DOM is that that's

00:03:18.545 --> 00:03:19.790
the effective DOM, right?

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:20.080
BRENDAN KENNY: Yes.

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:21.170
PAUL SAXMAN: So it's after
any DOM transferring--

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:24.260
BRENDAN KENNY: This is the
actual document tree that's

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:25.220
live in your document.

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:28.460
It might not actually match your
HTML if you've done some

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:34.220
transformation JavaScript, or
if you've just done bad HTML

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:35.950
that's not actually valid.

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:38.040
The browser will try
and fix it up.

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:39.940
And so it might insert elements
where you don't

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:41.380
expect them.

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:44.640
So one thing you can see here
is that all these wider

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:47.930
screens that are really popular
today, there's not a

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:52.550
whole lot of room for your
dev tools to also be

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:53.380
able to see the map.

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:56.400
And there is a handy option
used to be kind of buried

00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:01.390
away, but now is pretty readily
available up front.

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:05.580
If you come down to the bottom
left you can see the undock

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:08.550
button, which lets you undock
it and have it as

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:09.190
a standalone thing.

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:14.060
But you're still managing it,
its place and everything.

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:17.759
But there is a very nice new
button that just lets you dock

00:04:17.759 --> 00:04:18.529
it to the right.

00:04:18.529 --> 00:04:22.420
And that's really handy on these
wider screens, as I say.

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:24.360
The DOM tree gets a
little awkward.

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:27.250
But it's useful for our
other panels here.

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:36.250
So I wanted to start and come
over to the developer console.

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:42.110
So this is a live JavaScript
environment that lets you

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:45.640
actually interact with
the page and anything

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:46.380
that's in the page.

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:49.410
So if you look at the Map simple
example, one of the

00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:51.410
things that it does, which is
one of the most helpful things

00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:56.310
you can do, is it leaves the map
object at the top level in

00:04:56.310 --> 00:04:57.480
the global scope.

00:04:57.480 --> 00:04:59.940
And that lets you actually
interact with it on the

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:01.480
JavaScript console.

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:03.130
When you go in to production
maybe you don't want to have

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:05.820
that exposed or you don't
want to pollute the

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:06.710
name space or whatever.

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:09.380
But during development it's
extremely helpful be able to

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:12.560
go in and actually tweak it.

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:17.090
So the example I like to give to
just start off here is the

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:21.240
classic example of I just want
to drop a Map in a page and

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:24.000
have it positioned to view
that looks good.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.400
And so what you can do
if we go back over

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:28.030
to our source code--

00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:29.900
PAUL SAXMAN: Oh, quick, point
out the Map in the global

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:31.540
scope, what that looks like.

00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:33.140
BRENDAN KENNY: Oh, here?

00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:34.320
PAUL SAXMAN: Yeah, not too
familiar with scope.

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:37.850
BRENDAN KENNY: So, yeah, you put
it here at the top scope

00:05:37.850 --> 00:05:38.490
you declare your map.

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:41.680
And this makes it a
global variable.

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:46.230
Sometimes in examples you'll see
the Map is actually with

00:05:46.230 --> 00:05:49.760
it, declared within the
initialized function.

00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:54.040
And because you're actually
adding it to the DOM, it won't

00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:56.280
be garbage collected even though
you no longer have it

00:05:56.280 --> 00:05:59.170
referenced it to that variable
if you've only declared it

00:05:59.170 --> 00:06:00.760
inside that function.

00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:05.130
So the Map will go on living
like some kind of zombie, but

00:06:05.130 --> 00:06:08.850
you'll have no way to actually
go in there and tweak its need

00:06:08.850 --> 00:06:09.740
for brains.

00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:11.690
I don't think that
metaphor works.

00:06:11.690 --> 00:06:19.000
But so here's a pretty typical
way of declaring a Map.

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.610
You declare your Map
options object.

00:06:21.610 --> 00:06:26.190
You then pass it to the Google
Maps instructor, along with a

00:06:26.190 --> 00:06:28.330
reference to the HTML element
that you want

00:06:28.330 --> 00:06:29.580
to put the Map into.

00:06:31.830 --> 00:06:34.910
And so what you typically are
going to want to have, or what

00:06:34.910 --> 00:06:38.800
you need, is actually a zoom
level to start off and a

00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:41.490
lat-long center of your Map.

00:06:41.490 --> 00:06:44.120
And so what you can do is sit
here and tweak these values,

00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:46.720
like, OK, well I know that
North American is in the

00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:50.450
Western Hemisphere and like,
whatever, California is on the

00:06:50.450 --> 00:06:52.660
left side of the US.

00:06:52.660 --> 00:06:55.430
And tweak these values and save
it and then flip back to

00:06:55.430 --> 00:06:56.540
your Map and refresh.

00:06:56.540 --> 00:06:59.160
But that's a little bit silly
because we can actually

00:06:59.160 --> 00:07:00.800
interact with this Map life.

00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:04.260
So if I go here into the
developer console and type

00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:06.290
map, I actually get
this reference.

00:07:06.290 --> 00:07:08.420
And it's been closure
compiled, so

00:07:08.420 --> 00:07:09.410
everything's been minified.

00:07:09.410 --> 00:07:11.650
You got all these short names
and sometimes it's a little

00:07:11.650 --> 00:07:12.470
bit intimidating.

00:07:12.470 --> 00:07:15.950
But if you go to the Maps API
docs, you can see all the

00:07:15.950 --> 00:07:19.270
public functions or methods that
live on the Map object.

00:07:19.270 --> 00:07:21.790
And you can also see some
of them in here.

00:07:21.790 --> 00:07:26.650
So one thing you can do is say
map.getZoom and actually see

00:07:26.650 --> 00:07:27.390
the current zoom of the Map.

00:07:27.390 --> 00:07:29.830
And it's eight, which is exactly
where we started.

00:07:29.830 --> 00:07:31.650
So let's say we do want
to go back here.

00:07:31.650 --> 00:07:36.480
We zoom out and we do want to
start on California just

00:07:36.480 --> 00:07:38.770
because

00:07:38.770 --> 00:07:39.660
PAUL SAXMAN: That's
where we live.

00:07:39.660 --> 00:07:43.150
BRENDAN KENNY: Yeah, we're so
California-centric, I guess.

00:07:43.150 --> 00:07:46.150
So we'll come down here and then
I really want to look at

00:07:46.150 --> 00:07:47.970
the Moffett Airfield and
I want that to be the

00:07:47.970 --> 00:07:49.160
center of my Map.

00:07:49.160 --> 00:07:52.810
So I now have positioned this
and I think this a good view.

00:07:52.810 --> 00:07:54.210
This is where I want to be.

00:07:54.210 --> 00:07:58.980
So I can do map.getZoom to see
what I've done rather than

00:07:58.980 --> 00:08:01.590
keep track of what zoom level
I'm on, or whatever.

00:08:01.590 --> 00:08:04.340
And I can see that I'm
on Map zoom level 14.

00:08:04.340 --> 00:08:07.270
And now I want to actually--

00:08:07.270 --> 00:08:11.814
well, I'll go over here and edit
it and make this 14 so I

00:08:11.814 --> 00:08:13.390
don't forget.

00:08:13.390 --> 00:08:14.440
OK.

00:08:14.440 --> 00:08:17.310
So now I switch back and now I
actually want the center of my

00:08:17.310 --> 00:08:18.910
new map to be this as well.

00:08:18.910 --> 00:08:23.600
So I can actually say
map.getCenter, but one thing

00:08:23.600 --> 00:08:26.480
you'll see is that you get
this object back because

00:08:26.480 --> 00:08:28.200
getCenter return is
a lat-long object.

00:08:28.200 --> 00:08:32.490
And you can see there's really
nice variable names here,

00:08:32.490 --> 00:08:34.159
which is actually great because
it keeps JavaScript

00:08:34.159 --> 00:08:38.409
sights low, but it hides
it from you.

00:08:38.409 --> 00:08:42.809
But you can do a really nice
thing that it has on it.

00:08:42.809 --> 00:08:48.800
Getcenter.toString is overridden
by the lat long

00:08:48.800 --> 00:08:53.600
object to give you a nicely
formatted lat long string of

00:08:53.600 --> 00:08:53.980
your object.

00:08:53.980 --> 00:09:01.500
And now I can just copy that
directly and let's keep all

00:09:01.500 --> 00:09:02.970
the digits just for fun.

00:09:02.970 --> 00:09:04.470
I left an extra thing
in there.

00:09:04.470 --> 00:09:05.080
PAUL SAXMAN: There's
a lot of digits.

00:09:05.080 --> 00:09:05.500
BRENDAN KENNY: Yeah.

00:09:05.500 --> 00:09:09.240
So now when I save and I come
back over here and I'll zoom

00:09:09.240 --> 00:09:12.340
out and move the map just so
you believe me, now when I

00:09:12.340 --> 00:09:16.570
save and refresh, I start
exactly on Moffett field at

00:09:16.570 --> 00:09:16.930
the center.

00:09:16.930 --> 00:09:17.950
So it's really simple.

00:09:17.950 --> 00:09:19.980
And if I'm boring you right
now, I apologize.

00:09:19.980 --> 00:09:23.780
But this is a really good way
to just make this sort of

00:09:23.780 --> 00:09:25.140
thing really easy.

00:09:25.140 --> 00:09:28.015
And that's kind of the thread
throughout all the tips that

00:09:28.015 --> 00:09:29.160
we're going to show
you today--

00:09:29.160 --> 00:09:31.370
is just that there's lots of
ways you can interact with

00:09:31.370 --> 00:09:34.590
your Map right in the developer
console so that you

00:09:34.590 --> 00:09:37.100
can sit there and live tweak
it, rather than have to sit

00:09:37.100 --> 00:09:40.050
there and edit, refresh,
edit, refresh.

00:09:40.050 --> 00:09:44.030
And you lose the continuity
between the tweaks that you're

00:09:44.030 --> 00:09:48.140
making and the code that you're
actually adjusting.

00:09:48.140 --> 00:09:52.080
So I think I'm going to
show a few more things

00:09:52.080 --> 00:09:52.930
that you can tweak.

00:09:52.930 --> 00:09:53.890
OK.

00:09:53.890 --> 00:09:59.630
So just as a Pro-tip, just
like most terminals or

00:09:59.630 --> 00:10:02.370
consoles, you can hit
the Up-Arrow to

00:10:02.370 --> 00:10:03.610
get your last entry.

00:10:03.610 --> 00:10:06.710
So if I hit the Up-Arrow, I can
see the last entry that I

00:10:06.710 --> 00:10:09.540
actually input as input.

00:10:09.540 --> 00:10:11.980
And so that's going to be really
helpful for us if we

00:10:11.980 --> 00:10:14.800
want to go back to a thing, like
if we messed something

00:10:14.800 --> 00:10:16.850
up, we can go back
and check it.

00:10:20.990 --> 00:10:22.450
PAUL SAXMAN: Some map options.

00:10:22.450 --> 00:10:23.120
BRENDAN KENNY: Sure.

00:10:23.120 --> 00:10:27.450
So the Map object, if we go back
to the constructor here,

00:10:27.450 --> 00:10:30.790
the map object is constructed
with this map options object.

00:10:30.790 --> 00:10:33.290
So we create this object literal
here, this far Map

00:10:33.290 --> 00:10:38.510
options, and we add all these
properties to it, and then we

00:10:38.510 --> 00:10:39.770
pass that to Map.

00:10:39.770 --> 00:10:42.140
And the Map is constructed
with those options.

00:10:42.140 --> 00:10:43.190
So that's fine.

00:10:43.190 --> 00:10:46.130
But the Map object actually
can take Map

00:10:46.130 --> 00:10:47.590
options at any time.

00:10:47.590 --> 00:10:51.150
You can set options and pass
it a whole object full of

00:10:51.150 --> 00:10:51.580
properties.

00:10:51.580 --> 00:10:53.080
So you don't have to set things
individually if you

00:10:53.080 --> 00:10:53.490
don't want to.

00:10:53.490 --> 00:10:55.470
If you want to change your map
completely at the push of a

00:10:55.470 --> 00:10:57.550
button, you can.

00:10:57.550 --> 00:10:59.760
So let's take a look at that.

00:10:59.760 --> 00:11:02.940
If I come back over here
and actually make--

00:11:02.940 --> 00:11:09.630
I copied this Map options
directly from our source code

00:11:09.630 --> 00:11:10.310
and I make this--

00:11:10.310 --> 00:11:11.000
PAUL SAXMAN: Make
it look nice.

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:12.250
BRENDAN KENNY: --all
over again.

00:11:14.690 --> 00:11:16.680
So now I can make this object.

00:11:16.680 --> 00:11:18.200
And let's call it
something else.

00:11:18.200 --> 00:11:21.590
Let's say, new options.

00:11:21.590 --> 00:11:24.450
And now if I actually check, I
actually created a variable

00:11:24.450 --> 00:11:27.130
called new options and I can
inspect it live and see the

00:11:27.130 --> 00:11:29.610
center object and
what have you.

00:11:29.610 --> 00:11:32.190
So if I go back up and hit
the Up-Arrow twice,

00:11:32.190 --> 00:11:33.370
I can adjust this.

00:11:33.370 --> 00:11:37.140
So let's say I really want a
zoom level 12 and I want my

00:11:37.140 --> 00:11:42.725
lat long to become just
a nicer formatted one.

00:11:45.560 --> 00:11:50.520
And now you get some benefits
like you'll start getting

00:11:50.520 --> 00:11:52.680
completion by the dev tools.

00:11:52.680 --> 00:11:56.980
And so I can actually see when
I hit map type ID dot, I can

00:11:56.980 --> 00:11:58.830
see the options that
are available.

00:11:58.830 --> 00:12:01.570
And in this case let's
switch to satellite.

00:12:01.570 --> 00:12:06.050
And if I hit Shift-Enter, that
gives me a line break rather

00:12:06.050 --> 00:12:10.440
than entering the console,
which is handy.

00:12:10.440 --> 00:12:12.230
So now I have a new
options object.

00:12:12.230 --> 00:12:14.560
And if I check the new options
object, it's there.

00:12:14.560 --> 00:12:16.740
So what I want to do is actually
take these options

00:12:16.740 --> 00:12:18.220
and add it to the Map.

00:12:18.220 --> 00:12:22.750
And so I can do map.setOptions
new options.

00:12:22.750 --> 00:12:28.430
When I hit Enter it switches
to a totally new place and

00:12:28.430 --> 00:12:31.320
this looks like Santa Cruz?

00:12:31.320 --> 00:12:32.120
Something like that.

00:12:32.120 --> 00:12:32.560
PAUL SAXMAN: Right.

00:12:32.560 --> 00:12:35.320
BRENDAN KENNY: And it switched
to the satellite maps.

00:12:35.320 --> 00:12:37.390
And so if I want to switch back,
I can just set my new

00:12:37.390 --> 00:12:40.150
options back to the original
thing and then set

00:12:40.150 --> 00:12:43.320
map.setOptions and switch it
back to my Moffett field.

00:12:43.320 --> 00:12:44.130
So that's really handy.

00:12:44.130 --> 00:12:46.200
So what that means is that you
can actually sit there and

00:12:46.200 --> 00:12:49.760
tweak all the options
right there live.

00:12:49.760 --> 00:12:53.320
So this is even handier than
tweaking something and then

00:12:53.320 --> 00:12:57.040
refreshing the page even within
the console because a

00:12:57.040 --> 00:12:58.960
lot of these options can be
tweaked right at run time.

00:12:58.960 --> 00:13:02.290
So I can go down here and
hit Clear to clear out

00:13:02.290 --> 00:13:06.290
this mess or Clear.

00:13:06.290 --> 00:13:07.590
PAUL SAXMAN: Show the zoom.

00:13:07.590 --> 00:13:09.300
Like the min and max zoom.

00:13:09.300 --> 00:13:11.680
BRENDAN KENNY: Yeah,
that's a good idea.

00:13:11.680 --> 00:13:12.330
PAUL SAXMAN: That's
a really neat one.

00:13:12.330 --> 00:13:15.220
So when you're passing in these
options objects, you're

00:13:15.220 --> 00:13:17.340
only overwriting the ones
that you specify.

00:13:17.340 --> 00:13:19.085
So, for example, like--

00:13:19.085 --> 00:13:23.800
well I mean, default UI
is on by default--

00:13:23.800 --> 00:13:26.510
but, for example, if he didn't
specify roadmap and he just

00:13:26.510 --> 00:13:29.040
set a new lat long center then
it would still stay in the

00:13:29.040 --> 00:13:31.230
roadmap mode but just re-specify
the center.

00:13:31.230 --> 00:13:31.960
So you can--

00:13:31.960 --> 00:13:32.360
BRENDAN KENNY: Right.

00:13:32.360 --> 00:13:38.280
So if I do this different zoom
and center but I remove the

00:13:38.280 --> 00:13:43.510
satellite, it will move these
to Santa Cruz but not switch

00:13:43.510 --> 00:13:46.430
to the satellite view.

00:13:46.430 --> 00:13:51.010
Because if you don't set a new
option, it doesn't overwrite

00:13:51.010 --> 00:13:52.590
what you had already set.

00:13:52.590 --> 00:13:54.170
PAUL SAXMAN: So it is just kind
of useful for just trying

00:13:54.170 --> 00:13:56.170
out different values.

00:13:56.170 --> 00:13:59.430
A lot of times what I want to
do with my Math is, for me,

00:13:59.430 --> 00:14:01.430
specifically, when I'm like
building visualization, I want

00:14:01.430 --> 00:14:03.150
to turn off certain
UI controls.

00:14:03.150 --> 00:14:05.095
Like I want to see what it looks
like without the D-pad

00:14:05.095 --> 00:14:11.110
or without the Map satellite
selector, that type of thing.

00:14:11.110 --> 00:14:14.230
And also, zoom levels are really
important, because with

00:14:14.230 --> 00:14:16.720
certain visualizations the
visualization only works at a

00:14:16.720 --> 00:14:17.610
certain zoom level.

00:14:17.610 --> 00:14:21.130
Like if you're zoomed too
far in, then your

00:14:21.130 --> 00:14:22.050
information is too dense.

00:14:22.050 --> 00:14:25.350
If you're zoomed too far out,
then maybe your heat map is

00:14:25.350 --> 00:14:26.650
not showing density properly.

00:14:26.650 --> 00:14:30.670
So you can do things directly in
here, actually, to set your

00:14:30.670 --> 00:14:32.730
min and max zoom.

00:14:32.730 --> 00:14:34.810
So what I find is really cool
about this is actually just

00:14:34.810 --> 00:14:37.460
the UI controls, dynamically.

00:14:37.460 --> 00:14:40.490
So can you do that real quick?

00:14:40.490 --> 00:14:41.180
BRENDAN KENNY: What's that?

00:14:41.180 --> 00:14:43.640
PAUL SAXMAN: Oh, just set
like a max zoom to--

00:14:43.640 --> 00:14:44.360
BRENDAN KENNY: Sure.

00:14:44.360 --> 00:14:47.430
So, let's see, how do I--

00:14:47.430 --> 00:14:51.340
So what I'm going to do is
actually hit Shift- Enter, and

00:14:51.340 --> 00:14:54.470
now I'm going to do it
right like this.

00:14:54.470 --> 00:14:56.520
So I was going to combine the
two, but why not have it on

00:14:56.520 --> 00:14:57.220
separate lines.

00:14:57.220 --> 00:14:59.970
So that the console can actually
execute multiple

00:14:59.970 --> 00:15:01.300
lines of JavaScript.

00:15:01.300 --> 00:15:03.120
It will just execute the
whole chunk of it.

00:15:03.120 --> 00:15:05.810
And so this is actually
two statements--

00:15:05.810 --> 00:15:08.735
we declare an object and then
we set the options right in

00:15:08.735 --> 00:15:11.390
one go so that I could sit here
and tweak it and not have

00:15:11.390 --> 00:15:14.830
to hit Up and find set options
and what have you.

00:15:14.830 --> 00:15:19.956
So, yes, I don't care about the
center and i don't care

00:15:19.956 --> 00:15:20.440
about the satellite.

00:15:20.440 --> 00:15:22.560
This time I want to
do the mid-zoom.

00:15:22.560 --> 00:15:23.460
Is that what you want to try?

00:15:23.460 --> 00:15:25.680
PAUL SAXMAN: Sure.

00:15:25.680 --> 00:15:34.030
BRENDAN KENNY: So the mid-zoom
is, as you said, it sets the

00:15:34.030 --> 00:15:38.360
limits on the zoom
that you can do.

00:15:38.360 --> 00:15:39.510
It can be your visualization.

00:15:39.510 --> 00:15:41.710
It could be like I want to
center on a place and I don't

00:15:41.710 --> 00:15:45.110
want you to zoom out and see
the whole world repeating

00:15:45.110 --> 00:15:47.910
because it's just a total
distraction, what have you.

00:15:47.910 --> 00:15:55.290
So if we set the mid-zoom, let's
see, but we really want

00:15:55.290 --> 00:15:57.210
to set the max-zoom right now.

00:15:57.210 --> 00:15:57.646
PAUL SAXMAN: Yeah, sure.

00:15:57.646 --> 00:15:58.520
Do all.

00:15:58.520 --> 00:16:00.580
BRENDAN KENNY: OK, so
that's a good point.

00:16:00.580 --> 00:16:09.200
So let's say we want the
mid-zoom to be five and we

00:16:09.200 --> 00:16:12.860
want the max-zoom to be 10.

00:16:12.860 --> 00:16:13.410
Let's say that.

00:16:13.410 --> 00:16:15.500
And currently we're
at 12, I think.

00:16:15.500 --> 00:16:21.220
So when we set this option it
will actually zoom us out

00:16:21.220 --> 00:16:24.070
because we were at 12 and
so we've now set a

00:16:24.070 --> 00:16:25.190
maximum zoom at 10.

00:16:25.190 --> 00:16:26.460
So it zoomed us out,
which is nice.

00:16:26.460 --> 00:16:29.550
And you can now see that we
can't zoom any more and we

00:16:29.550 --> 00:16:35.660
can't zoom past five.

00:16:35.660 --> 00:16:36.490
So that's handy.

00:16:36.490 --> 00:16:39.041
So, yeah, that's another
option that you can

00:16:39.041 --> 00:16:40.980
sit here and tweak.

00:16:40.980 --> 00:16:44.580
Now I've decided that
actually 10 is not

00:16:44.580 --> 00:16:46.820
sufficient, let's do 12.

00:16:46.820 --> 00:16:48.990
And so now I can actually
go in two more.

00:16:48.990 --> 00:16:50.580
And, well, that's
not quite right.

00:16:50.580 --> 00:16:53.100
Let's do 11.

00:16:53.100 --> 00:16:53.860
Like that.

00:16:53.860 --> 00:16:58.320
And I've also decided that the
default UI, which is one of

00:16:58.320 --> 00:17:00.450
your favorite ones
to get rid of.

00:17:00.450 --> 00:17:01.820
It's not really necessary
here.

00:17:01.820 --> 00:17:02.780
I don't need a pan tool.

00:17:02.780 --> 00:17:07.130
I'm not interested in Street
View because I need some heat

00:17:07.130 --> 00:17:07.694
map over it.

00:17:07.694 --> 00:17:11.170
And I don't want the satellite
option because

00:17:11.170 --> 00:17:11.579
I want a heat map.

00:17:11.579 --> 00:17:14.250
So I can add one more
option here and it's

00:17:14.250 --> 00:17:18.724
disable default UI.

00:17:18.724 --> 00:17:21.213
Is it capital UI?

00:17:21.213 --> 00:17:22.660
PAUL SAXMAN: Yeah.

00:17:22.660 --> 00:17:24.196
True

00:17:24.196 --> 00:17:25.040
BRENDAN KENNY: Let's try that.

00:17:25.040 --> 00:17:26.260
So there we go.

00:17:26.260 --> 00:17:31.310
So now it's gotten rid of all
the controls and looks great.

00:17:31.310 --> 00:17:35.990
So I want to add this
back to my code now.

00:17:35.990 --> 00:17:40.390
Because if I refresh the
page it's all gone.

00:17:40.390 --> 00:17:43.850
And I can always still hit Up
and I get back the last thing

00:17:43.850 --> 00:17:49.000
I entered, but I want to
actually add this to my code.

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:50.850
And so it's actually
really simple.

00:17:50.850 --> 00:17:54.080
All I'm going to do here
is copy the options.

00:17:54.080 --> 00:17:56.500
I could copy the full object,
but I'm going to actually

00:17:56.500 --> 00:18:01.910
integrate this into my Map
options object and just copy.

00:18:01.910 --> 00:18:05.950
And now I need to do
some formatting.

00:18:05.950 --> 00:18:11.520
And now if I come over here and
refresh the page, you can

00:18:11.520 --> 00:18:15.990
see that I am centered at
Moffett field but I'm limited

00:18:15.990 --> 00:18:23.640
to my zoom level and the
default UI is disabled.

00:18:23.640 --> 00:18:24.460
PAUL SAXMAN: We lost
our zoom controls.

00:18:24.460 --> 00:18:25.720
But you can add those back in.

00:18:25.720 --> 00:18:28.270
I mean there's an option
for zoom controls.

00:18:28.270 --> 00:18:31.040
BRENDAN KENNY: Yeah, and you
can still do scrolling and

00:18:31.040 --> 00:18:32.790
double-clicking.

00:18:32.790 --> 00:18:34.640
So that's one way.

00:18:34.640 --> 00:18:35.580
There's a couple
different ways.

00:18:35.580 --> 00:18:37.840
So I have my new
options object.

00:18:37.840 --> 00:18:40.050
And there's a couple different
ways to get it out.

00:18:40.050 --> 00:18:42.070
Honestly, the easiest one
I find is just to

00:18:42.070 --> 00:18:43.510
Copy and Paste it.

00:18:43.510 --> 00:18:46.420
You can also do something
like, JSON did

00:18:46.420 --> 00:18:48.930
stringify new options.

00:18:48.930 --> 00:18:53.220
And this just uses the built in
JSON functionality to turn

00:18:53.220 --> 00:18:57.620
your object into a string
so that you can copy it.

00:18:57.620 --> 00:18:59.880
The problem is that you get all
these extra quotes and I

00:18:59.880 --> 00:19:00.840
hate those.

00:19:00.840 --> 00:19:02.870
But some people like those
and so if that's

00:19:02.870 --> 00:19:04.310
your bag, that's great.

00:19:04.310 --> 00:19:06.320
Or you can sit there
and delete those.

00:19:06.320 --> 00:19:09.120
I personally prefer to
copy where possible.

00:19:09.120 --> 00:19:13.700
And one final little pro-tip is
one of the other built in

00:19:13.700 --> 00:19:16.960
functions that the dev tools
has is I can actually do

00:19:16.960 --> 00:19:21.850
copyJSON.stringify
new options.

00:19:24.400 --> 00:19:28.400
And that'll actually copy that
to the clipboard and if I came

00:19:28.400 --> 00:19:30.010
over here and I could paste
it but then I'd

00:19:30.010 --> 00:19:33.110
have to fix up whatever.

00:19:33.110 --> 00:19:35.460
You can see that the outer ones
are at least disabled.

00:19:35.460 --> 00:19:41.220
So this is at least actually
valid JavaScript, if you

00:19:41.220 --> 00:19:45.430
consider those extra
quotes valid.

00:19:45.430 --> 00:19:47.250
PAUL SAXMAN: It works.

00:19:47.250 --> 00:19:48.300
BRENDAN KENNY: It
does execute.

00:19:48.300 --> 00:19:48.910
That's true.

00:19:48.910 --> 00:19:50.200
It's just ugly.

00:19:50.200 --> 00:19:52.590
So I think that's all I'm going
to bore people with, and

00:19:52.590 --> 00:19:54.950
if you want to show
even cooler things

00:19:54.950 --> 00:19:56.260
that you can tweak.

00:19:56.260 --> 00:19:56.590
PAUL SAXMAN: Yeah.

00:19:56.590 --> 00:20:01.010
So my shtick is actually just
working on the visualizations

00:20:01.010 --> 00:20:03.590
and trying to get the
visualization to look right in

00:20:03.590 --> 00:20:04.410
the browser as well.

00:20:04.410 --> 00:20:07.680
So this is a visualization
I've been working on.

00:20:07.680 --> 00:20:11.270
So this is actually kind
of in debug mode.

00:20:11.270 --> 00:20:13.575
We'll maybe talk about the
visualization itself at

00:20:13.575 --> 00:20:18.530
another point, but essentially
it's just building heat maps

00:20:18.530 --> 00:20:19.790
from images.

00:20:19.790 --> 00:20:22.380
So what I want to do--
so I have a lot of

00:20:22.380 --> 00:20:23.250
controls in here already.

00:20:23.250 --> 00:20:25.090
These are custom controls
that I put in.

00:20:25.090 --> 00:20:27.100
I actually did custom
styling as well.

00:20:27.100 --> 00:20:32.860
So I'm going to go to someplace
interesting.

00:20:32.860 --> 00:20:35.080
BRENDAN KENNY: Paris, Texas
is more interesting.

00:20:35.080 --> 00:20:37.110
PAUL SAXMAN: Yeah, there's
actually, unfortunately, not

00:20:37.110 --> 00:20:37.820
enough photos.

00:20:37.820 --> 00:20:40.590
I mean there's like 60
photos which are more

00:20:40.590 --> 00:20:42.470
than I would've expected.

00:20:42.470 --> 00:20:45.210
But so I just have some code
here that's actually just

00:20:45.210 --> 00:20:46.560
going to build a heat map.

00:20:46.560 --> 00:20:51.150
It's going to drop some polygons
onto the Map and then

00:20:51.150 --> 00:20:52.700
do some scanning for
some photos.

00:20:52.700 --> 00:20:54.440
BRENDAN KENNY: What is
the heat map doing?

00:20:54.440 --> 00:20:56.020
What does it represent?

00:20:56.020 --> 00:20:58.550
PAUL SAXMAN: This is actually
a density of photographs.

00:20:58.550 --> 00:21:01.240
So I'm going to Picasa and
pulling down all the

00:21:01.240 --> 00:21:03.990
photographs which include
lat-long information and then

00:21:03.990 --> 00:21:05.180
building a heat map
out of that.

00:21:05.180 --> 00:21:07.020
And this kind of sub-sectoring
thing--

00:21:07.020 --> 00:21:09.420
we'll talk about this
at another point.

00:21:09.420 --> 00:21:13.040
I don't want to bore people
about the unfinished business

00:21:13.040 --> 00:21:14.290
of this visualization.

00:21:17.660 --> 00:21:21.800
This sub-sectoring is actually
dealing with a cap on how many

00:21:21.800 --> 00:21:23.770
photos you can pull down
and it's like 1,000.

00:21:23.770 --> 00:21:28.040
So I keep zooming in to
different levels to pull more

00:21:28.040 --> 00:21:29.310
information out.

00:21:29.310 --> 00:21:30.875
Actually this was a bad place
because this just

00:21:30.875 --> 00:21:31.630
has a ton of photos.

00:21:31.630 --> 00:21:32.730
It takes a little
while to run.

00:21:32.730 --> 00:21:34.320
So maybe we will go
to Paris, Texas.

00:21:36.890 --> 00:21:37.720
Let me run this here.

00:21:37.720 --> 00:21:41.360
And so in terms of dev tools,
there's a couple of things

00:21:41.360 --> 00:21:42.140
that I want to do here.

00:21:42.140 --> 00:21:44.370
So one is that I have
I heat map.

00:21:44.370 --> 00:21:46.590
I may want to tweak, actually,
the styling of the heat map to

00:21:46.590 --> 00:21:50.310
make it fit my presentation
a little bit better.

00:21:50.310 --> 00:21:52.746
And the other is I actually have
a polygon on her that I

00:21:52.746 --> 00:21:53.540
had put on earlier.

00:21:53.540 --> 00:21:56.340
And I may actually want to
tweak the styling of the

00:21:56.340 --> 00:22:00.550
polygon to make it fit a little
bit better with the

00:22:00.550 --> 00:22:01.380
styling that I want.

00:22:01.380 --> 00:22:06.110
So, again, I could go back to
my Sublime and actually edit

00:22:06.110 --> 00:22:09.450
the code and then go back
over to reload the

00:22:09.450 --> 00:22:12.660
page until I get that--

00:22:12.660 --> 00:22:14.610
BRENDAN KENNY: --perfect
polygon styling?

00:22:14.610 --> 00:22:15.590
PAUL SAXMAN: Yeah, exactly.

00:22:15.590 --> 00:22:19.580
So I'm really bad, like a lot
of times that I just want to

00:22:19.580 --> 00:22:22.880
tweak the lightness by like one
or five or something like.

00:22:25.860 --> 00:22:28.560
But you can do all this in the
Chrome tab tools like we were

00:22:28.560 --> 00:22:29.180
showing earlier.

00:22:29.180 --> 00:22:32.840
So one thing that's really
interesting, so what I did

00:22:32.840 --> 00:22:35.830
with this visualization is
I have the polygon--

00:22:35.830 --> 00:22:37.140
actually I have an array
of polygons that's

00:22:37.140 --> 00:22:38.330
in the global scope.

00:22:38.330 --> 00:22:40.440
I also have a heat map in
global scope as well.

00:22:40.440 --> 00:22:42.590
So I can just go to the--

00:22:42.590 --> 00:22:47.160
I have my heat map here and I
also have the polygons object

00:22:47.160 --> 00:22:47.980
right here as well.

00:22:47.980 --> 00:22:50.130
So I can just pull
these guys out.

00:22:50.130 --> 00:22:53.110
I can see we only have one
polygon in here, actually

00:22:53.110 --> 00:22:54.360
array nine.

00:22:56.360 --> 00:22:58.840
Oh, it's because I'm
in the zero point.

00:22:58.840 --> 00:23:04.790
And with that polygon I can
start doing things like set

00:23:04.790 --> 00:23:06.290
some style options on here.

00:23:06.290 --> 00:23:08.990
So this works exactly the
same way as the--

00:23:08.990 --> 00:23:10.210
BRENDAN KENNY: You
missed the I.

00:23:10.210 --> 00:23:12.160
PAUL SAXMAN: Oh, thank you.

00:23:12.160 --> 00:23:15.410
It works the same way as
with the map object.

00:23:15.410 --> 00:23:17.700
Whatever options you specify
when you created the object

00:23:17.700 --> 00:23:19.740
are kind of the defaults at this
point and then you can

00:23:19.740 --> 00:23:21.370
incrementally tweak them.

00:23:21.370 --> 00:23:27.590
So what I want to do let's
say fill opacity 0.2.

00:23:30.940 --> 00:23:31.370
Did that work?

00:23:31.370 --> 00:23:33.580
Oh maybe I'm already at
0.2, let's do 0.8.

00:23:33.580 --> 00:23:33.960
There we go.

00:23:33.960 --> 00:23:36.270
So you can see that now, with
this polygon, I've actually

00:23:36.270 --> 00:23:41.460
made it a lot more dense, or
the opacity a lot higher.

00:23:41.460 --> 00:23:45.360
So things like you can do like
fill opacity, basically any

00:23:45.360 --> 00:23:46.670
property on these.

00:23:46.670 --> 00:23:49.400
Or you can do fill color,
for example.

00:23:49.400 --> 00:23:51.805
Colors, since their hex, they
have to be in double quotes.

00:23:55.450 --> 00:23:58.410
So if you have like complex
polygons, let's say even

00:23:58.410 --> 00:24:02.750
polylines, markers, they work
the same way, just tweak these

00:24:02.750 --> 00:24:03.380
in your browser.

00:24:03.380 --> 00:24:06.270
Get them to the point that you
think they look right and then

00:24:06.270 --> 00:24:08.770
just copy your values
back out again.

00:24:08.770 --> 00:24:11.960
You can also do things like if
you want to get rid of it.

00:24:11.960 --> 00:24:14.540
So I put this kind
of handy hide

00:24:14.540 --> 00:24:16.000
polygons method over here.

00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:18.850
It basically goes over my array
and deletes them all.

00:24:18.850 --> 00:24:24.320
I could actually call that from
the console and actually

00:24:24.320 --> 00:24:26.560
get rid of it.

00:24:26.560 --> 00:24:28.030
Let's get it back again.

00:24:28.030 --> 00:24:31.380
Or what I could do here
is I could just say

00:24:31.380 --> 00:24:32.630
polygon0.setmap null.

00:24:37.920 --> 00:24:40.760
And what setmap null, I mean
this works the same with

00:24:40.760 --> 00:24:41.530
polygons, polylines--

00:24:41.530 --> 00:24:43.720
and did I forget something?

00:24:46.440 --> 00:24:47.160
BRENDAN KENNY: I'm like
a spell check.

00:24:47.160 --> 00:24:47.550
PAUL SAXMAN: Yeah.

00:24:47.550 --> 00:24:47.990
There you go.

00:24:47.990 --> 00:24:48.930
BRENDAN KENNY: Right here.

00:24:48.930 --> 00:24:50.180
PAUL SAXMAN: Yeah.

00:24:53.400 --> 00:24:55.800
Now I have actually one more
in my collections.

00:24:55.800 --> 00:24:57.240
BRENDAN KENNY: It'll
give you a clue.

00:24:57.240 --> 00:25:00.420
Because it'll actually complete
as you go along.

00:25:00.420 --> 00:25:02.990
It'll attempt to complete and
if it's not that means you

00:25:02.990 --> 00:25:04.230
probably misspelled something.

00:25:04.230 --> 00:25:04.570
PAUL SAXMAN: Yeah.

00:25:04.570 --> 00:25:06.270
And the trick there
is just Tab.

00:25:06.270 --> 00:25:08.673
As it starts to auto complete
you just Tab over

00:25:08.673 --> 00:25:09.960
and it'll fill in.

00:25:09.960 --> 00:25:12.150
Or you can Up-Arrow, Down-Arrow
to select if

00:25:12.150 --> 00:25:14.080
there's multiple options.

00:25:14.080 --> 00:25:17.730
So like I said before, so the
heat map is the same way.

00:25:17.730 --> 00:25:21.810
So it actually works the
exact same way as well.

00:25:21.810 --> 00:25:25.000
I do this quite a bit, actually,
because things like,

00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:26.520
so radius and max intensity--

00:25:26.520 --> 00:25:27.512
BRENDAN KENNY: Will
you zoom in?

00:25:27.512 --> 00:25:30.004
So you can see it better?

00:25:30.004 --> 00:25:31.912
PAUL SAXMAN: Zoom in.

00:25:31.912 --> 00:25:34.560
Oh, well that's the trick.

00:25:34.560 --> 00:25:35.310
BRENDAN KENNY: Oh, good point.

00:25:35.310 --> 00:25:38.740
PAUL SAXMAN: So now what I can
do is if I decrease the

00:25:38.740 --> 00:25:41.090
radius, that's going to actually
decrease the spread

00:25:41.090 --> 00:25:42.390
of each data point.

00:25:42.390 --> 00:25:44.690
So if I'm zoomed out too far
and I'm not getting a good

00:25:44.690 --> 00:25:50.670
heat map, I can do things like
increase the radius to

00:25:50.670 --> 00:25:53.670
actually make the data spread
out a little more.

00:25:53.670 --> 00:25:56.710
The problem with that
is as I zoom in, the

00:25:56.710 --> 00:25:59.420
radius stays constant.

00:25:59.420 --> 00:26:01.480
So this could be a little bit
deceiving, as were talking

00:26:01.480 --> 00:26:04.850
about earlier, it's like,
what is a heat map?

00:26:04.850 --> 00:26:06.820
When the data, when you have
this actually spread, is it

00:26:06.820 --> 00:26:09.990
actually error, or is it--

00:26:09.990 --> 00:26:10.940
BRENDAN KENNY: It represents
some--

00:26:10.940 --> 00:26:12.370
PAUL SAXMAN: --kind
of variance.

00:26:12.370 --> 00:26:13.150
BRENDAN KENNY: --kind of area.

00:26:13.150 --> 00:26:15.270
But often people don't actually
know what the area

00:26:15.270 --> 00:26:15.740
represents.

00:26:15.740 --> 00:26:18.210
So think about your heat maps
before you just make them

00:26:18.210 --> 00:26:18.650
willy-nilly.

00:26:18.650 --> 00:26:20.910
They look good though.

00:26:20.910 --> 00:26:24.115
It's an easy way to make your
data look good though.

00:26:24.115 --> 00:26:25.970
Just try not to lie.

00:26:25.970 --> 00:26:26.560
PAUL SAXMAN: Totally.

00:26:26.560 --> 00:26:27.810
Totally.

00:26:30.680 --> 00:26:33.360
So, I mean, really good
at showing density.

00:26:33.360 --> 00:26:36.240
So actually that's one point
about this heat map is I have

00:26:36.240 --> 00:26:39.060
these points out here, you can
see kind of in the periphery.

00:26:39.060 --> 00:26:41.480
Actually, that's only one
photograph and it's actually

00:26:41.480 --> 00:26:43.470
showing some density
in my heat map.

00:26:43.470 --> 00:26:44.570
I may not want that.

00:26:44.570 --> 00:26:46.420
And the way that you can
actually tweak that is using

00:26:46.420 --> 00:26:47.360
the max intensity.

00:26:47.360 --> 00:26:57.620
So the next intensity specifies
the maximum density

00:26:57.620 --> 00:26:59.310
that you'll actually show.

00:26:59.310 --> 00:27:01.240
And then everything above
that is cut off.

00:27:01.240 --> 00:27:05.630
So let's say for now, I think,
let's do something higher. as

00:27:05.630 --> 00:27:09.710
I increase the max intensity,
you can see that actually the

00:27:09.710 --> 00:27:12.630
lower density points actually
kind of fade off on the end.

00:27:12.630 --> 00:27:18.110
So it's a nice trick if you
don't want to make the low

00:27:18.110 --> 00:27:19.630
density areas prominent,
just keep

00:27:19.630 --> 00:27:21.370
increasing your max intensity.

00:27:21.370 --> 00:27:23.080
Likewise, the inverse
works as well.

00:27:23.080 --> 00:27:26.790
So if you do actually really
want to show that there's some

00:27:26.790 --> 00:27:29.950
activity in these low dense
areas you can actually

00:27:29.950 --> 00:27:32.770
decrease the max intensity
to something really low.

00:27:32.770 --> 00:27:34.860
But at that point there, when
you have max intensity of one,

00:27:34.860 --> 00:27:37.640
that means every point,
actually, everything has the

00:27:37.640 --> 00:27:38.460
same density.

00:27:38.460 --> 00:27:40.400
See everything is actually
peaks at

00:27:40.400 --> 00:27:43.470
red,which is not very useful.

00:27:43.470 --> 00:27:45.100
BRENDAN KENNY: It might be.

00:27:45.100 --> 00:27:45.520
You never know.

00:27:45.520 --> 00:27:46.370
PAUL SAXMAN: Yeah, maybe.

00:27:46.370 --> 00:27:48.166
I guess it would be--

00:27:48.166 --> 00:27:50.840
BRENDAN KENNY: You never know.

00:27:50.840 --> 00:27:52.790
PAUL SAXMAN: So polygons,
polylines, you can style those

00:27:52.790 --> 00:27:54.290
pretty simply.

00:27:54.290 --> 00:27:55.590
Heat maps, you can actually
tweak those

00:27:55.590 --> 00:27:57.300
dynamically as well.

00:27:57.300 --> 00:28:03.410
If you want a marker on your
map, you can do things like

00:28:03.410 --> 00:28:05.130
create these objects
on the fly.

00:28:05.130 --> 00:28:07.760
I mean, you could even create a
heat map object on the fly.

00:28:07.760 --> 00:28:11.260
If you're using MVC arrays for
your heat maps and your

00:28:11.260 --> 00:28:15.390
polygons and your polylines,
actually you can dynamically

00:28:15.390 --> 00:28:17.120
change your data.

00:28:17.120 --> 00:28:19.870
I didn't really make an example
for that, but let's

00:28:19.870 --> 00:28:24.500
say I wanted to plot another
heat map point on here, I

00:28:24.500 --> 00:28:30.860
could actually go and I could
do it and add that to the

00:28:30.860 --> 00:28:33.830
interface dynamically as well.

00:28:33.830 --> 00:28:39.620
Markers, I mean, this is kind of
simple stuff, but you could

00:28:39.620 --> 00:28:40.820
do things like this--

00:28:40.820 --> 00:28:48.530
new google dot, so sometimes I
do this if I want to basically

00:28:48.530 --> 00:28:50.780
am building an interface and I
want to actually see what it

00:28:50.780 --> 00:28:55.070
looks like with certain
components on the Map, like a

00:28:55.070 --> 00:28:57.480
polygons and markers.

00:28:57.480 --> 00:29:00.960
You just add these things
dynamically.

00:29:00.960 --> 00:29:03.040
Oops, I'm trying to talk and
think at the same time.

00:29:03.040 --> 00:29:05.510
It doesn't always work
out very well.

00:29:05.510 --> 00:29:06.420
But what is it?

00:29:06.420 --> 00:29:10.310
So Map, and so you need
the Map for the--

00:29:16.960 --> 00:29:18.770
So this is just going
to position a

00:29:18.770 --> 00:29:19.880
marker on that for me.

00:29:19.880 --> 00:29:21.940
And then another fun thing that
I like to do with this

00:29:21.940 --> 00:29:25.950
for draggable true.

00:29:25.950 --> 00:29:28.560
So this actually makes, now I
have to two, actually, because

00:29:28.560 --> 00:29:29.460
I overrode that.

00:29:29.460 --> 00:29:31.920
But you can just actually
add a draggable marker.

00:29:31.920 --> 00:29:33.510
This is kind of fun too because,
like as Brendan

00:29:33.510 --> 00:29:35.760
pointed out earlier, I can
actually go back to this

00:29:35.760 --> 00:29:39.230
marker and actually get it's lat
long coordinates out if I

00:29:39.230 --> 00:29:40.750
really wanted to.

00:29:40.750 --> 00:29:42.470
BRENDAN KENNY: If you wanted
to set the exact right

00:29:42.470 --> 00:29:44.775
position that you want
and copy back out.

00:29:44.775 --> 00:29:46.000
PAUL SAXMAN: Yeah, and actually
I used this when we

00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:53.450
were doing the Mars map because,
on the Street View

00:29:53.450 --> 00:29:58.090
imagery, they had named
the certain rocks.

00:29:58.090 --> 00:29:59.170
But they didn't give
us the lat long

00:29:59.170 --> 00:30:00.560
coordinates of the rocks.

00:30:00.560 --> 00:30:03.220
So I actually had to take the
marker, make it draggable,

00:30:03.220 --> 00:30:05.503
drop it on the rock, and then
get the coordinates back out

00:30:05.503 --> 00:30:08.420
so I could actually position
it for the map.

00:30:08.420 --> 00:30:11.410
BRENDAN KENNY: Luckily, since
then they've released the

00:30:11.410 --> 00:30:12.320
exact position.

00:30:12.320 --> 00:30:15.550
So we don't have to fake
it anymore or guess.

00:30:15.550 --> 00:30:16.830
It wasn't a fake.

00:30:16.830 --> 00:30:19.900
I mean is was as real
as we could get.

00:30:19.900 --> 00:30:21.760
PAUL SAXMAN: Maybe we should go
back and see how accurate

00:30:21.760 --> 00:30:23.490
our marker preposition was.

00:30:23.490 --> 00:30:27.400
BRENDAN KENNY: That'd make for
a really interesting session.

00:30:27.400 --> 00:30:28.950
PAUL SAXMAN: So one last thing
that I was going to do real

00:30:28.950 --> 00:30:32.270
quick is Map style.

00:30:32.270 --> 00:30:34.240
So a Map style is another
one that you can

00:30:34.240 --> 00:30:35.490
actually tweak in here.

00:30:38.370 --> 00:30:39.390
So it really helps.

00:30:39.390 --> 00:30:43.910
So what we generally do with Map
styling is you definitely

00:30:43.910 --> 00:30:46.710
want to use the [? styles ?]
maps wizard.

00:30:46.710 --> 00:30:50.950
You use [? styles ?] maps wizard
to get pretty close to

00:30:50.950 --> 00:30:51.480
what you want.

00:30:51.480 --> 00:30:56.190
But then as you start layering
on a user interface--

00:30:56.190 --> 00:30:59.080
or actually like your heat maps,
a lot of times your heat

00:30:59.080 --> 00:31:01.300
map maybe isn't as intense as
you want, so you actually want

00:31:01.300 --> 00:31:04.390
to decrease the saturation of
the Map to make the heat map

00:31:04.390 --> 00:31:05.060
stick out a little more.

00:31:05.060 --> 00:31:07.490
Or maybe your parks look
a little bit dark.

00:31:07.490 --> 00:31:15.480
Again, you can do all your style
tweaking right in the

00:31:15.480 --> 00:31:16.970
Chrome dev tools.

00:31:16.970 --> 00:31:20.702
So with that, it's just styles
and you can pace

00:31:20.702 --> 00:31:21.730
your object in there.

00:31:21.730 --> 00:31:23.810
BRENDAN KENNY: You need
to put and object.

00:31:23.810 --> 00:31:24.290
PAUL SAXMAN: Oh, yeah.

00:31:24.290 --> 00:31:25.540
I need my object.

00:31:28.470 --> 00:31:33.086
See I came from a world
of Eclipse where--

00:31:33.086 --> 00:31:33.760
There you go.

00:31:33.760 --> 00:31:36.790
So now I just actually set
the pre-existing style.

00:31:36.790 --> 00:31:39.520
Let me just look at
parks for example.

00:31:39.520 --> 00:31:41.960
If I go back over here, I could
just Up-Arrow and I can

00:31:41.960 --> 00:31:45.850
say let's go to lightness.

00:31:45.850 --> 00:31:49.330
So I have my parks and I
want it minus 20 now.

00:31:49.330 --> 00:31:50.890
So you see that I've
set a new style.

00:31:50.890 --> 00:31:54.710
The parks have actually
got a lot darker.

00:31:54.710 --> 00:31:57.460
Again, the best way to actually
go back once you've

00:31:57.460 --> 00:31:59.280
actually tweaked your
style to something

00:31:59.280 --> 00:32:03.982
that you like we can--

00:32:03.982 --> 00:32:06.390
oh, there we got that's got
a little color now--

00:32:06.390 --> 00:32:09.330
the best way to get it back out
is just copy and paste.

00:32:09.330 --> 00:32:14.130
Take this code, actually,
probably be even better to use

00:32:14.130 --> 00:32:18.220
your technique, but just copy,
paste back out once you get

00:32:18.220 --> 00:32:20.510
everything tweaked the
way you like it.

00:32:20.510 --> 00:32:23.210
So the idea is that instead
of actually doing your

00:32:23.210 --> 00:32:25.680
development in your text editing
tool, you actually

00:32:25.680 --> 00:32:28.850
push a lot of the development in
to the browser so that you

00:32:28.850 --> 00:32:31.770
can kind of view this
dynamically, make your tweaks

00:32:31.770 --> 00:32:35.560
on the fly and save you a lot
of time from Alt-Tabbing or

00:32:35.560 --> 00:32:38.130
whatever it is to go
between windows.

00:32:38.130 --> 00:32:39.360
BRENDAN KENNY: And if you're
doing a lot of development you

00:32:39.360 --> 00:32:42.310
can always make custom functions
explicitly for

00:32:42.310 --> 00:32:42.880
development.

00:32:42.880 --> 00:32:47.820
Things like set hue could be a
function that you write and

00:32:47.820 --> 00:32:49.800
then it actually sets the hue on
like five different things

00:32:49.800 --> 00:32:53.070
at once-- your markers, your
map style, or whatever.

00:32:53.070 --> 00:32:55.000
It does all these
things at once.

00:32:55.000 --> 00:32:57.960
And that way you can tweak it
until you have it right, maybe

00:32:57.960 --> 00:33:02.130
pass it off to a designer who is
less interested in actually

00:33:02.130 --> 00:33:05.710
poking around parts of your code
or something like that,

00:33:05.710 --> 00:33:08.510
especially if it's kind of
spread out depending on your

00:33:08.510 --> 00:33:10.500
development style.

00:33:10.500 --> 00:33:12.680
And then once they have it
exactly where they want it,

00:33:12.680 --> 00:33:16.230
you can then go in and copy
those values you generated

00:33:16.230 --> 00:33:18.300
back in your source code.

00:33:18.300 --> 00:33:20.010
And there's a couple different
ways you can do that.

00:33:20.010 --> 00:33:22.290
Other than that, we're not
going to cover today.

00:33:22.290 --> 00:33:23.570
But there's lots of information

00:33:23.570 --> 00:33:24.320
available out there.

00:33:24.320 --> 00:33:27.670
Lots of screen casts from
Paul Irish and the

00:33:27.670 --> 00:33:30.430
Chrome dev RL team.

00:33:30.430 --> 00:33:33.500
They do a really good GDL
on the dev tools.

00:33:33.500 --> 00:33:37.290
Things like maybe it's not all
your code that you can really

00:33:37.290 --> 00:33:39.260
just go in it and put things
in the global scope.

00:33:39.260 --> 00:33:41.970
And so you can actually set
break points into styling

00:33:41.970 --> 00:33:44.790
functions so that when it gets
there, you can tweak the

00:33:44.790 --> 00:33:46.760
values live that are
going to get passed

00:33:46.760 --> 00:33:48.690
into the Maps object.

00:33:48.690 --> 00:33:52.200
Or you can actually make changes
to the source code in

00:33:52.200 --> 00:33:56.600
the source panel and then save
it to a file on its own.

00:33:56.600 --> 00:33:59.350
And that's all covered in those
videos and we might

00:33:59.350 --> 00:34:00.880
cover in a future session.

00:34:00.880 --> 00:34:03.190
But for now we'll leave
it at this.

00:34:03.190 --> 00:34:04.540
This is something really
simple that you

00:34:04.540 --> 00:34:05.280
can start with today.

00:34:05.280 --> 00:34:07.410
If you've avoided using the dev
tools, you should open it

00:34:07.410 --> 00:34:09.850
up and just start playing in
the console because it's a

00:34:09.850 --> 00:34:11.010
dead simple thing.

00:34:11.010 --> 00:34:14.909
There's almost no UI that you
need to learn compared to all

00:34:14.909 --> 00:34:19.150
the ways to step through your
code or tweak your CSS.

00:34:19.150 --> 00:34:22.380
And so it's a great way
to get started.

00:34:22.380 --> 00:34:25.750
You'll soon find that it makes
your work flow so much better

00:34:25.750 --> 00:34:30.679
and so much faster, especially
if you're using Alerts still.

00:34:30.679 --> 00:34:32.949
And if you are, something's
wrong with you.

00:34:32.949 --> 00:34:34.290
You shouldn't do that.

00:34:34.290 --> 00:34:35.659
PAUL SAXMAN: I'm just getting
over console.log.

00:34:35.659 --> 00:34:36.219
BRENDAN KENNY: Yeah.

00:34:36.219 --> 00:34:38.820
Well console.log is useful.

00:34:38.820 --> 00:34:39.949
That's a good thing.

00:34:39.949 --> 00:34:41.639
Just don't alert.

00:34:41.639 --> 00:34:44.080
PAUL SAXMAN: But I'll second the
point about checking out

00:34:44.080 --> 00:34:45.550
some of the Chrome teams.

00:34:45.550 --> 00:34:47.750
One we were going to show today
was like tweaking CSS

00:34:47.750 --> 00:34:51.909
styles, they've covered that
ad nauseum, I think.

00:34:51.909 --> 00:34:54.560
But like all these controls,
like when we build these kind

00:34:54.560 --> 00:34:56.820
of map-centric interfaces and
we drop our own custom

00:34:56.820 --> 00:34:59.940
controls, there's no reason you
can't tweak these things,

00:34:59.940 --> 00:35:01.880
tweak the CSS and
export it out.

00:35:01.880 --> 00:35:02.540
BRENDAN KENNY: It's
all in your DOM.

00:35:02.540 --> 00:35:05.355
PAUL SAXMAN: Using some other
techniques that the Chrome

00:35:05.355 --> 00:35:05.760
team covers.

00:35:05.760 --> 00:35:11.760
So with that we will bid adieu
and if you guys have any

00:35:11.760 --> 00:35:13.910
questions, just post them in the
comments and we'll try to

00:35:13.910 --> 00:35:15.260
get back to you guys on those.

00:35:15.260 --> 00:35:17.620
And hope you enjoyed the show.

00:35:17.620 --> 00:35:18.870
See you in a week.

00:35:25.580 --> 00:35:53.533
