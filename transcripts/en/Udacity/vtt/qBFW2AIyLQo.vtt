00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
And very certainly, the answer is again yes. An unloaded coin has a probability of 0.5.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.000
So whatever the ratio the top, the observations of heads

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000
must be exactly half the total number of observations.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000
If the total number of observations is 111, that's just not possible.

00:00:18.000 --> 99:59:59.000
So the coin will look ever so small loaded even if it's a fair coin.
