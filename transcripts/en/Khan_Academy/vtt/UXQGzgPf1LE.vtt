00:00:00.830 --> 00:00:03.300
Let's now use what we know about the chain
rule and

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:08.020
the product rule to take the derivative of
an even weirder expression.

00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:13.206
So, we're gonna take the derivative, we're
gonna take the derivative of

00:00:13.206 --> 00:00:17.090
either the cosine of x times the cosine of
e to the x.

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:18.880
So, let's take the derivative of this.

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:21.360
So, we can view this as the product of two
functions.

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:26.582
So, the product rule tells us that this is
going to be

00:00:26.582 --> 00:00:32.039
the derivative with respect to x of e to
the cosine of x,

00:00:32.039 --> 00:00:37.495
e to the cosine of x times cosine times
cosine of e to the x

00:00:37.495 --> 00:00:43.960
plus, plus the first function, just e to
the cosine of x.

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:48.240
E to the cosine of x, times the derivative
of the second function.

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:53.816
Times the derivative with respect to x of
cosine of e to the x.

00:00:53.816 --> 00:00:55.030
Cosine of e to the x.

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:01.710
And so, we just need to figure out what
these two derivatives are.

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:04.810
And so you can imagine the chain rule
might be applicable here.

00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:05.670
So, let me make it clear.

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:08.780
This, we got from the product rule.

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:12.380
Product, product rule.

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:13.864
But then, to evaluate each of these

00:01:13.864 --> 00:01:15.750
derivatives, we need to use the chain
rule.

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:17.700
So, let's think about this a little bit.

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:22.050
So, the derivative, let me copy and paste
this so I don't have to rewrite it.

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:25.840
So, copy and paste.

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:29.458
So, let's think about what the derivative
of e to

00:01:29.458 --> 00:01:33.080
the cosine of x is, e to the cosine of x.

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:36.957
So, we can view our outer function as e to
the something

00:01:36.957 --> 00:01:40.582
,as e to the something and the derivative
of e to the

00:01:40.582 --> 00:01:44.713
something with respect to something is
just going to be e to

00:01:44.713 --> 00:01:48.710
that something so it's going to be e to
the cosine of x.

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:51.070
So, let me do that in that same blue
color.

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:53.021
So, it's going to be e, actually I'm gonna
do it

00:01:53.021 --> 00:01:55.900
in that, actually I'm gonna do it in a new
color.

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:57.350
Let me do it in magenta.

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:00.222
So, the derivative of e to the something
with

00:02:00.222 --> 00:02:03.550
respect to something is just e to the
something.

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:06.053
It's just e to the cosine of x, and we
have to

00:02:06.053 --> 00:02:10.160
multiply that times the derivative of the
something with respect to x.

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:14.250
So, what's the derivative of cosine of x
with respect to x?

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:16.450
Well, that's just negative sine of x.

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:21.160
So, it's times negative sine of x.

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:23.400
And so, we figured out this first
derivative.

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:24.710
Let me make it clear.

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:31.710
This right over here is the derivative of
e to the cosine of x.

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:37.850
Derivative of e to the cosine of x, with
respect to, with respect to cosine of x.

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:41.524
And this right over here, this right over
here is the

00:02:41.524 --> 00:02:45.710
derivative of cosine of x with respect,
with respect to x.

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:46.940
And we just took the product of the two.

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:49.130
That's what the chain rule tells us.

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:50.040
Fair enough.

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:52.850
Now, let's figure out this derivative out
here.

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:57.360
So, we want to find the derivative with
respect to x of cosine e to the x.

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:00.310
So, once again, let me copy and paste it.

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:03.540
So, we need to figure out this thing right
over here.

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:07.410
So first, just like we did, we're just
going to apply the chain rule again.

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:11.650
We need to figure out the derivative of
cosine of something,

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:14.860
in this case, e to the x, with respect to
that something.

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:18.859
So, this is going to be equal to
derivative of cosine of something

00:03:18.859 --> 00:03:23.930
with respect to that something is equal to
the negative sine of that something.

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:27.640
Negative sine of e to x, of e to the x.

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:32.606
Once again, we can view this as the
derivative of cosine

00:03:32.606 --> 00:03:38.110
of e to the x, with respect to, with
respect to e to the x.

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:39.863
And then we multiply that times the

00:03:39.863 --> 00:03:42.880
derivative of the something with respect
to x.

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:46.140
So, let me do this, and this, and I'm
running out of colors.

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:48.530
Let me do this in the screen color.

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:52.810
So, times the derivative of e to the x
with respect to x is just e to the x.

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:56.736
So that right over there is the derivative
of

00:03:56.736 --> 00:04:00.565
e to the x with respect, with respect to
x.

00:04:00.565 --> 00:04:03.421
And so, we're essentially done, we just
have to substitute what

00:04:03.421 --> 00:04:06.228
we found using the chain rule back into
our original expression.

00:04:06.228 --> 00:04:09.929
The derivative of this business up here is
going to be equal to, let

00:04:09.929 --> 00:04:15.410
me just copy and paste everything just to
make everything nice, nice and clean.

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:18.880
So, copy and paste.

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:23.004
So, that is going to be equal to, is going
to be equal to

00:04:23.004 --> 00:04:27.846
this times cosine e to the x, so this is
going to be, we'll see,

00:04:27.846 --> 00:04:31.701
we could put the e to the x out front, we
could put the

00:04:31.701 --> 00:04:37.640
negative out front, so we could write it
as negative e to the cosine x.

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:44.762
e to the Cosine x, times Sine of x, times
Sine of x,

00:04:44.762 --> 00:04:52.110
times Cosine of e to the x, times Cosine
of e to the x.

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:54.100
So, that's this first term here.

00:04:54.100 --> 00:05:00.740
Plus, plus e of the cosine x times all of
this stuff.

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:03.780
And so, let's see, we can put the negative
out front again.

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:05.350
So let's put that negative out front.

00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:10.970
So we have a negative, negative of e to
the cosine of x times e to the x.

00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:12.520
I can write it this way.

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:16.343
e to the x times e to the cosine of x, and
you could simplify that, or combine

00:05:16.343 --> 00:05:19.199
it, since you're multiplying two things
with the same

00:05:19.199 --> 00:05:22.060
base, but I'll just leave it like this,
like this.

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:26.500
e to the x, times e to the cosine of x,
times the sine.

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:29.920
We already have the negative, so then we
have sine of e to the x.

00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:33.390
Sine of e to the x, right over here.

00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:37.311
Times sin, sin, of e to the x, we had
negative sin e

00:05:37.311 --> 00:05:40.867
to the x times e to the x, negative sin of
e to the

00:05:40.867 --> 00:05:44.606
x times e to the x, and then that
multiplied by e to

00:05:44.606 --> 00:05:49.810
the cosine of x so we have the exact same
thing right over here.

00:05:49.810 --> 00:05:50.270
And we're done.
