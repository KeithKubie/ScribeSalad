00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:02.440
- Keep going, keep growing

00:00:02.440 --> 00:00:05.910
makes me think that if you keep on going,

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:10.140
if you put your effort and
your time into something,

00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:12.030
you will keep on going.

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:13.760
LearnStorm reading made me realize

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:16.670
how much you can grow in
just a short amount of time

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:19.070
and if you put that same amount of effort,

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:21.460
you can grow even more.

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:23.810
- When I hear keep going, keep growing,

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:26.670
I think that you have to push your limits

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:30.950
and if you make a mistake to
keep growing in your learning.

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:32.913
If you're doing LearnStorm this year,

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:35.470
don't let anybody stop you from

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:38.530
making your goals and it's
okay to make mistakes.

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:40.793
You'll learn from them and keep going.
