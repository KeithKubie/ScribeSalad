00:00:00.099 --> 00:00:03.399
Now we’ve all come to terms with the fact
that when we find Alien life, it probably

00:00:03.399 --> 00:00:05.790
won’t look like this, or this, or even this
guy.

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:09.650
What we’re more likely to find, is this
-- bacteria.

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:13.950
Which is exactly what NASA is hoping to find
on future missions to Mars and Saturn’s

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:20.430
icy moon Enceladus.

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:23.590
Trying to find life on other planets, especially
when looking for something as microscopic

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:25.940
as bacteria, is tricky to say the least.

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:30.050
It’s a bit like trying to find a stranger
in a crowd -- unless you know who you’re

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:32.050
looking for, you will probably never find
them.

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:35.749
It’s the same for astrobiologists searching
for microbial life on other planets, without

00:00:35.749 --> 00:00:39.809
knowing what we’re looking for, or where
to look, trying to find extraterrestrial life

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:41.379
can seem impossible.

00:00:41.379 --> 00:00:45.609
Luckily, there are clues to help solve this
conundrum, right here, on Earth.

00:00:45.609 --> 00:00:51.719
To be more specific, indications of what alien
life might look like can be found in naturally-occurring,

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:52.719
extreme environments.

00:00:52.719 --> 00:00:56.219
That’s because these habitats are probably
as close as we’re going to get to mimicking

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:00.989
those on other planets, like boiling hot springs,
permafrost and hydrothermal vents.

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:06.570
And while these environments may seem inhospitable,
organisms do live and even thrive, in these

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:07.570
surroundings.

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:09.690
Scientists call these organisms extremophiles.

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:15.119
And the very first example of one was found
just over 40 years ago, here, in the hot springs

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:17.119
of Yellowstone National Park.

00:01:17.119 --> 00:01:21.219
Researchers discovered that tiny microbes
who were able to thrive within the hot springs,

00:01:21.219 --> 00:01:24.219
enduring temperatures of 160 degrees fahrenheit.3

00:01:24.219 --> 00:01:28.549
Since they were first discovered, extremophiles
have been found in a variety of extreme environments

00:01:28.549 --> 00:01:29.790
across the globe.

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:34.049
Most are microbes, like bacteria, fungi or
algae but there are one or two examples of

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:38.780
more complex organisms, like Pompeii worms
found near hydrothermal vents or Antarctic

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:39.780
Krill.

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:45.100
Regardless, of their complexity, every example
of extremophile has adapted to an environmental

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:49.249
niche that differs from the mesophilic conditions
generally found on Earth.

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:54.049
Some can exist in extreme acidity, some without
oxygen or light while others survive in high

00:01:54.049 --> 00:01:56.109
levels of radiation.

00:01:56.109 --> 00:02:00.710
Armed with this knowledge, Astrobiologists
are starting to speculate whether extremophiles

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:06.740
could endure the high carbon dioxide atmosphere
on the surface of Mars or in it’s deep subsurface

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:07.740
permafrost.

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:11.780
And researchers aren’t just interested in
if extremophiles could survive on another

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:15.120
planet, they're also curious to see if they
could survive in space.

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:20.900
In 2011, a study conducted by the Japan Agency
of Marine-Earth Science, subjected several

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:26.680
extremophile bacterial strains to extreme
gravity, roughly 400 thousand times stronger

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:28.000
than Earth.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.410
In order to do this, they placed each strain
of bacteria in an ultracentrifuge at high

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:36.940
speeds -- according to the researchers, the
idea was to simulate the kind of hyper-acceleration

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:41.580
which is usually found only in cosmic environments,
such as on massive stars or in the shock waves

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:42.580
of supernovas.

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:47.610
What they found was that one strain, called
Paracoccus denitrificans, not only survived

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:51.850
the extreme gravity but experienced rapid
growth.

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:55.620
Now this is huge news, because this means
that life forms could potentially survive

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:57.290
in the extreme gravity of space.

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:01.820
Meaning that life could survive something
like an interplanetary exchange, something

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:03.100
like a meteor strike.

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:06.770
It all falls in line with a theory known as
Panspermia, which proposes that lifeforms

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:12.210
could transfer from one world to the next,
by travelling across space on comets or meteoroids.

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:16.340
This theory hasn’t been proven yet, but
Astrobiologists continue to test extremophiles

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:21.530
on Earth in space-like conditions, each time
hoping to find more clues about life and how

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:23.580
it may have spread throughout the universe.

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:28.590
So yes, it would be great to shake hands with
an intelligent being from another galaxy,

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:33.520
but discovering bacteria on one of Saturn’s
moons is just as important because finding

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:37.340
microbes on meteoroids in outer space, or
on other planets, could tell us more about

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:40.190
the universe than any Vulcan could.

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:43.610
Our fascination with learning more about the
universe is only limited by our ability to

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:44.670
explore it.

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:48.450
The New James Webb Telescope will finally
allow us to observe some of the most distant

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:50.300
objects in the Universe.

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:53.440
If you want an incredible behind-the-scenes
look at the new James Webb Space Telescope,

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:57.160
make sure to check out Discovery’s brand
new documentary Telescope!

00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:00.590
The world premiere is this Saturday, February
20 at 9pm on the Discovery Channel.

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:15.690
I’ll be tuning 

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:32.890
in too.
