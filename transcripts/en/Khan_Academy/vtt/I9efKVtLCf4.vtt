00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:02.590
What is the volume of this box?

00:00:02.590 --> 00:00:04.352
Drag on the box to rotate it.

00:00:04.352 --> 00:00:05.310
So this is pretty neat.

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:09.272
We can actually sit
and rotate this box.

00:00:09.272 --> 00:00:10.730
And here it looks
like everything's

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:12.130
being measured in meters.

00:00:12.130 --> 00:00:16.420
So we want to measure our
volume in terms of cubic meters.

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:18.150
That's going to be
our unit cube here.

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:21.530
So when we want to think about
how many cubic meters could fit

00:00:21.530 --> 00:00:24.000
in this box, we've
already seen examples.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.600
You really just have to multiply
the three different dimensions

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:28.749
of this box.

00:00:28.749 --> 00:00:30.540
So if you wanted the
number of cubic meters

00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:32.000
that could fit in
here, it's going

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:39.960
to be six meters times 8
meters times 7 meters which

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.700
is going to give you
something in cubic meters.

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:44.340
So let's think
about what that is.

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:48.580
6 times 8 is 48.

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:50.980
Let me see if I can
do this in my head.

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:55.750
48 times 7, that's
40 times 7, which

00:00:55.750 --> 00:01:03.010
is going to be 280 plus
8 times 7, which is 56,

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:12.970
280 plus 56 is going to be 336.

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:14.340
Let's check our answer.

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.575
Let's do one more of these.

00:01:16.575 --> 00:01:17.950
So what's the
volume of this box?

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:21.020
We'll once again, we have
its height at six feet.

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:22.790
Now everything is
being measured in feet.

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:27.520
We have it's width
being four feet.

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:31.670
So we could multiple the height
times the width of four feet.

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:34.850
And then we can multiply that
times its depth of two feet.

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:42.420
So 6 times 4 is 24
times 2 is 48 feet.

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:44.990
48, and I should say cubic feet.

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:47.580
We're saying how many
cubic feet can fit in here?

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:51.340
When we multiply the various
dimensions measured in feet,

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:53.100
we're counting almost
how many of those

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:57.230
cubic feet can
fit into this box.
