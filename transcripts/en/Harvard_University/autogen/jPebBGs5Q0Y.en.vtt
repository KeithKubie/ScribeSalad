the school of public health so I know
 

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:34.000
the school of public health so I know
there was a slide earlier about that but

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:34.010
there was a slide earlier about that but
 

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:35.920
there was a slide earlier about that but
it's really putting a challenge out to

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:35.930
it's really putting a challenge out to
 

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:38.290
it's really putting a challenge out to
the University to figure out with all

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:38.300
the University to figure out with all
 

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:40.090
the University to figure out with all
these smart minds here among our

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:40.100
these smart minds here among our
 

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:42.310
these smart minds here among our
students can we come up with innovations

00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:42.320
students can we come up with innovations
 

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:43.319
students can we come up with innovations
that would make the food system

00:00:43.319 --> 00:00:43.329
that would make the food system
 

00:00:43.329 --> 00:00:46.840
that would make the food system
healthier more sustainable and more

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:46.850
healthier more sustainable and more
 

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:49.990
healthier more sustainable and more
equitable and so I'd like to start

00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:50.000
equitable and so I'd like to start
 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.090
equitable and so I'd like to start
actually just I love getting in front of

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:52.100
actually just I love getting in front of
 

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:53.860
actually just I love getting in front of
a group of non-lawyers because it's a

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:53.870
a group of non-lawyers because it's a
 

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:55.299
a group of non-lawyers because it's a
really great chance to educate people

00:00:55.299 --> 00:00:55.309
really great chance to educate people
 

00:00:55.309 --> 00:00:57.459
really great chance to educate people
about about what lawyers are and are not

00:00:57.459 --> 00:00:57.469
about about what lawyers are and are not
 

00:00:57.469 --> 00:01:00.910
about about what lawyers are and are not
and and kind of put a different spin on

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:00.920
and and kind of put a different spin on
 

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:02.740
and and kind of put a different spin on
I think what a lot of people expect and

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:02.750
I think what a lot of people expect and
 

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:05.770
I think what a lot of people expect and
so I think just wanted to explain what a

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:05.780
so I think just wanted to explain what a
 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:08.020
so I think just wanted to explain what a
clinic is in the law school sense and

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:08.030
clinic is in the law school sense and
 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:10.630
clinic is in the law school sense and
then also briefly about what what as

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:10.640
then also briefly about what what as
 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:12.550
then also briefly about what what as
lawyers we have to bring to the table in

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:12.560
lawyers we have to bring to the table in
 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:15.280
lawyers we have to bring to the table in
the food space and so a clinic in a law

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:15.290
the food space and so a clinic in a law
 

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:16.810
the food space and so a clinic in a law
school sent it's sort of like a clinic

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:16.820
school sent it's sort of like a clinic
 

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:18.190
school sent it's sort of like a clinic
in medical school or something like that

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:18.200
in medical school or something like that
 

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:19.929
in medical school or something like that
but the idea is that we're getting

00:01:19.929 --> 00:01:19.939
but the idea is that we're getting
 

00:01:19.939 --> 00:01:22.480
but the idea is that we're getting
students it's an action learning program

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:22.490
students it's an action learning program
 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:23.920
students it's an action learning program
for students so we have both a

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:23.930
for students so we have both a
 

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:25.870
for students so we have both a
service-oriented mission that's outward

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:25.880
service-oriented mission that's outward
 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:28.569
service-oriented mission that's outward
facing we work on projects we work on a

00:01:28.569 --> 00:01:28.579
facing we work on projects we work on a
 

00:01:28.579 --> 00:01:31.870
facing we work on projects we work on a
range of issues in the food system on

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:31.880
range of issues in the food system on
 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:34.120
range of issues in the food system on
increasing access on improving

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:34.130
increasing access on improving
 

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:35.620
increasing access on improving
opportunities for small scale

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:35.630
opportunities for small scale
 

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:37.690
opportunities for small scale
unsustainable growers to participate in

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:37.700
unsustainable growers to participate in
 

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:40.420
unsustainable growers to participate in
the food system but we're also educating

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:40.430
the food system but we're also educating
 

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:42.130
the food system but we're also educating
law students and we're helping them both

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:42.140
law students and we're helping them both
 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:44.139
law students and we're helping them both
get involved get the skills to be

00:01:44.139 --> 00:01:44.149
get involved get the skills to be
 

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:46.060
get involved get the skills to be
involved in the food system but also

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:46.070
involved in the food system but also
 

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:48.100
involved in the food system but also
their learning transferrable skills

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:48.110
their learning transferrable skills
 

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:49.660
their learning transferrable skills
about just being creative problem

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:49.670
about just being creative problem
 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:52.060
about just being creative problem
solvers and I think the other thing to

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:52.070
solvers and I think the other thing to
 

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:53.679
solvers and I think the other thing to
say about being a lawyer in this space

00:01:53.679 --> 00:01:53.689
say about being a lawyer in this space
 

00:01:53.689 --> 00:01:56.530
say about being a lawyer in this space
is that not all lawyers go to court and

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:56.540
is that not all lawyers go to court and
 

00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:58.359
is that not all lawyers go to court and
sue people which is probably like the

00:01:58.359 --> 00:01:58.369
sue people which is probably like the
 

00:01:58.369 --> 00:02:00.969
sue people which is probably like the
most for the image of lawyers that most

00:02:00.969 --> 00:02:00.979
most for the image of lawyers that most
 

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:02.620
most for the image of lawyers that most
people think of the way that we work

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:02.630
people think of the way that we work
 

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:04.929
people think of the way that we work
actually we don't litigate at all we use

00:02:04.929 --> 00:02:04.939
actually we don't litigate at all we use
 

00:02:04.939 --> 00:02:07.029
actually we don't litigate at all we use
our legal skills to help empower

00:02:07.029 --> 00:02:07.039
our legal skills to help empower
 

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:09.370
our legal skills to help empower
communities and individuals and and

00:02:09.370 --> 00:02:09.380
communities and individuals and and
 

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:11.500
communities and individuals and and
partners from other disciplines so that

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:11.510
partners from other disciplines so that
 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:13.540
partners from other disciplines so that
they understand this field and then also

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:13.550
they understand this field and then also
 

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:15.850
they understand this field and then also
to change policy and figure out where is

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:15.860
to change policy and figure out where is
 

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:16.220
to change policy and figure out where is
the

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:16.230
the
 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:18.830
the
all that's making this happen at the

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:18.840
all that's making this happen at the
 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:20.390
all that's making this happen at the
other thing I wanted to say is that this

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:20.400
other thing I wanted to say is that this
 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:22.399
other thing I wanted to say is that this
field is really growing in law schools I

00:02:22.399 --> 00:02:22.409
field is really growing in law schools I
 

00:02:22.409 --> 00:02:24.320
field is really growing in law schools I
think Harvard is at the forefront so

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:24.330
think Harvard is at the forefront so
 

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:25.699
think Harvard is at the forefront so
you'll hear later today from my

00:02:25.699 --> 00:02:25.709
you'll hear later today from my

food law lab at Harvard Law School we're

00:02:29.839 --> 00:02:29.849
food law lab at Harvard Law School we're
 

00:02:29.849 --> 00:02:31.729
food law lab at Harvard Law School we're
doing great it's been incredibly

00:02:31.729 --> 00:02:31.739
doing great it's been incredibly
 

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:34.460
doing great it's been incredibly
exciting but I in separate research I

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:34.470
exciting but I in separate research I
 

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:36.440
exciting but I in separate research I
did over the past few years with a

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:36.450
did over the past few years with a
 

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:38.300
did over the past few years with a
friend of mine we were looking at the

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:38.310
friend of mine we were looking at the
 

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:40.309
friend of mine we were looking at the
growth of this field across law schools

00:02:40.309 --> 00:02:40.319
growth of this field across law schools
 

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:42.410
growth of this field across law schools
and saw that at the top hundred law

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:42.420
and saw that at the top hundred law
 

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:44.900
and saw that at the top hundred law
schools in the u.s. at that time this is

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:44.910
schools in the u.s. at that time this is
 

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:47.809
schools in the u.s. at that time this is
two year old data 20 law schools had now

00:02:47.809 --> 00:02:47.819
two year old data 20 law schools had now
 

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:49.400
two year old data 20 law schools had now
food law and policy courses that are

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:49.410
food law and policy courses that are
 

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:50.780
food law and policy courses that are
pretty new i mean this is in the past

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:50.790
pretty new i mean this is in the past
 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:53.089
pretty new i mean this is in the past
five years or so so it's exciting to be

00:02:53.089 --> 00:02:53.099
five years or so so it's exciting to be
 

00:02:53.099 --> 00:02:54.770
five years or so so it's exciting to be
in this space it's exciting to see it

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:54.780
in this space it's exciting to see it
 

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:56.949
in this space it's exciting to see it
grow it's another interest of mine and

00:02:56.949 --> 00:02:56.959
grow it's another interest of mine and
 

00:02:56.959 --> 00:03:00.380
grow it's another interest of mine and

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:23.509
practices and also trying to figure out
how we can change practices that might

00:03:23.509 --> 00:03:23.519
how we can change practices that might
 

00:03:23.519 --> 00:03:25.819
how we can change practices that might
be more harmful to the environment or

00:03:25.819 --> 00:03:25.829
be more harmful to the environment or
 

00:03:25.829 --> 00:03:28.159
be more harmful to the environment or
labor or animal welfare and but I'm

00:03:28.159 --> 00:03:28.169
labor or animal welfare and but I'm
 

00:03:28.169 --> 00:03:29.960

going to talk briefly as one case study

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:29.970
going to talk briefly as one case study
 

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:31.610
going to talk briefly as one case study
on our work around the issue of food

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:31.620
on our work around the issue of food
 

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:35.420

waste so this is an incredibly important

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:35.430
waste so this is an incredibly important
 

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:37.759

issue I think growing in terms of the
 

00:03:37.769 --> 00:03:39.199
issue I think growing in terms of the
amount of people looking at it and

00:03:39.199 --> 00:03:39.209
amount of people looking at it and
 

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:41.030
amount of people looking at it and

global food system in the u.s. we waste
 

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:53.479
global food system in the u.s. we waste
about forty percent of the food that we

00:03:53.479 --> 00:03:53.489
about forty percent of the food that we
 

00:03:53.489 --> 00:03:55.400
about forty percent of the food that we
produce so if you look at this chart

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:55.410
produce so if you look at this chart
 

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:57.559
produce so if you look at this chart
that forty percent of food that we end

00:03:57.559 --> 00:03:57.569
that forty percent of food that we end
 

00:03:57.569 --> 00:04:00.800
that forty percent of food that we end

use tons of pesticides and fertilizers

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:06.750
use tons of pesticides and fertilizers
 

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:09.110
use tons of pesticides and fertilizers
and other agricultural inputs and then

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:09.120
and other agricultural inputs and then
 

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:11.170
and other agricultural inputs and then
it goes to landfills where it makes up

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:11.180
it goes to landfills where it makes up
 

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:13.729
it goes to landfills where it makes up
more than fifteen percent of methane

00:04:13.729 --> 00:04:13.739
more than fifteen percent of methane
 

00:04:13.739 --> 00:04:15.199

emissions which is a really potent
 

00:04:15.209 --> 00:04:18.009
emissions which is a really potent
greenhouse gas so this is a huge problem

00:04:18.009 --> 00:04:18.019
greenhouse gas so this is a huge problem
 

00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:20.479

food for a healthy active life so this

00:04:31.629 --> 00:04:31.639
food for a healthy active life so this
 

00:04:31.639 --> 00:04:33.370
food for a healthy active life so this
is a really big issue and we've been

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:33.380
is a really big issue and we've been
 

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:35.230
is a really big issue and we've been
working on this particularly in the

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:35.240
working on this particularly in the
 

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:37.659
working on this particularly in the
legal setting and so we published a

00:04:37.659 --> 00:04:37.669
legal setting and so we published a
 

00:04:37.669 --> 00:04:40.300
legal setting and so we published a
report a year ago that was really

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:40.310
report a year ago that was really
 

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:42.550

much waste so we took this challenge on

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:00.770
much waste so we took this challenge on
 

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:03.100

and and and i just want to show you a

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:03.110
and and and i just want to show you a

little bit of what this looks like to do

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:05.000
little bit of what this looks like to do
 

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.150
little bit of what this looks like to do
research in a legal context so we

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:07.160
research in a legal context so we
 

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:08.830
research in a legal context so we
started at the federal level and what we

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:08.840
started at the federal level and what we
 

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:10.870
started at the federal level and what we
found which may not be surprising to

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:10.880
found which may not be surprising to
 

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:12.730
found which may not be surprising to
everyone here but is surprising i think

00:05:12.730 --> 00:05:12.740
everyone here but is surprising i think
 

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:14.770
everyone here but is surprising i think
too many Americans is that there are no

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:14.780
too many Americans is that there are no
 

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:17.140
too many Americans is that there are no
federal regulations on expiration dates

00:05:17.140 --> 00:05:17.150
federal regulations on expiration dates
 

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:19.540
federal regulations on expiration dates
so those dates you see on food best buy

00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:19.550
so those dates you see on food best buy
 

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:22.210
so those dates you see on food best buy
used by salebuy there there are no

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:22.220

00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:24.520
used by salebuy there there are no
federal laws that limit what that

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:24.530
federal laws that limit what that

languages that require to be set in a
 

00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:28.689
languages that require to be set in a
certain way they're just completely

00:05:28.689 --> 00:05:28.699
certain way they're just completely
 

00:05:28.699 --> 00:05:31.060
certain way they're just completely
really up to companies to set those and

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:31.070
really up to companies to set those and
 

00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:32.439
really up to companies to set those and
in fact the food and drug administration

00:05:32.439 --> 00:05:32.449
in fact the food and drug administration
 

00:05:32.449 --> 00:05:35.080
in fact the food and drug administration
has chosen not to regulate because

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:35.090
has chosen not to regulate because
 

00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:37.120
has chosen not to regulate because
they've said this this has nothing to do

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:37.130
they've said this this has nothing to do
 

00:05:37.130 --> 00:05:39.070
they've said this this has nothing to do
with safety and so and we're really in

00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:39.080
with safety and so and we're really in
 

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:40.659
with safety and so and we're really in
the business of regulating around safety

00:05:40.659 --> 00:05:40.669
the business of regulating around safety
 

00:05:40.669 --> 00:05:42.760
the business of regulating around safety
and things that are misleading but this

00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:42.770
and things that are misleading but this
 

00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:44.560
and things that are misleading but this
doesn't really arise to something we're

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:44.570
doesn't really arise to something we're
 

00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:47.439
doesn't really arise to something we're
concerned about so the interesting legal

00:05:47.439 --> 00:05:47.449
concerned about so the interesting legal
 

00:05:47.449 --> 00:05:49.060
concerned about so the interesting legal
research came when we looked at states

00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:49.070
research came when we looked at states
 

00:05:49.070 --> 00:05:51.580
research came when we looked at states
and you can see here and also on this

00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:51.590
and you can see here and also on this
 

00:05:51.590 --> 00:05:54.250
and you can see here and also on this
map and we mapped out what states then

00:05:54.250 --> 00:05:54.260
map and we mapped out what states then
 

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:56.040
map and we mapped out what states then
regulate and what we found was that

00:05:56.040 --> 00:05:56.050
regulate and what we found was that
 

00:05:56.050 --> 00:05:59.649
regulate and what we found was that
forty percent aside 41 states require

00:05:59.649 --> 00:05:59.659
forty percent aside 41 states require
 

00:05:59.659 --> 00:06:01.990
forty percent aside 41 states require
date labels on at least one food product

00:06:01.990 --> 00:06:02.000
date labels on at least one food product
 

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:03.760
date labels on at least one food product
and if you can see I know you can't see

00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:03.770
and if you can see I know you can't see
 

00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:05.379
and if you can see I know you can't see
all the little icons but at the bottom

00:06:05.379 --> 00:06:05.389
all the little icons but at the bottom
 

00:06:05.389 --> 00:06:07.149
all the little icons but at the bottom
you can see how many different food

00:06:07.149 --> 00:06:07.159
you can see how many different food
 

00:06:07.159 --> 00:06:08.770
you can see how many different food
options there were four what states

00:06:08.770 --> 00:06:08.780
options there were four what states
 

00:06:08.780 --> 00:06:10.930
options there were four what states
regulated so here in Massachusetts we

00:06:10.930 --> 00:06:10.940
regulated so here in Massachusetts we
 

00:06:10.940 --> 00:06:13.420
regulated so here in Massachusetts we
regulate the most we require date labels

00:06:13.420 --> 00:06:13.430
regulate the most we require date labels
 

00:06:13.430 --> 00:06:16.749
regulate the most we require date labels
on a wide variety of foods some states

00:06:16.749 --> 00:06:16.759
on a wide variety of foods some states
 

00:06:16.759 --> 00:06:18.999
on a wide variety of foods some states
require them just on SE milkar seafood

00:06:18.999 --> 00:06:19.009
require them just on SE milkar seafood
 

00:06:19.009 --> 00:06:21.520
require them just on SE milkar seafood
and then states like New York and not an

00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:21.530
and then states like New York and not an
 

00:06:21.530 --> 00:06:23.560
and then states like New York and not an
eight other states don't require dates

00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:23.570
eight other states don't require dates
 

00:06:23.570 --> 00:06:25.600
eight other states don't require dates
on anything and then this map then shows

00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:25.610
on anything and then this map then shows
 

00:06:25.610 --> 00:06:28.450
on anything and then this map then shows
which states restrict sale or donation

00:06:28.450 --> 00:06:28.460
which states restrict sale or donation
 

00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:29.800
which states restrict sale or donation
of food after that day and that's about

00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:29.810
of food after that day and that's about
 

00:06:29.810 --> 00:06:32.110
of food after that day and that's about
20 states and so again on these days

00:06:32.110 --> 00:06:32.120
20 states and so again on these days
 

00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:33.670
20 states and so again on these days
that are not related to safety and are

00:06:33.670 --> 00:06:33.680
that are not related to safety and are
 

00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:35.409
that are not related to safety and are
not regulated people won't only allow

00:06:35.409 --> 00:06:35.419
not regulated people won't only allow
 

00:06:35.419 --> 00:06:37.719
not regulated people won't only allow
you to sell or donate them afterwards

00:06:37.719 --> 00:06:37.729
you to sell or donate them afterwards
 

00:06:37.729 --> 00:06:40.089
you to sell or donate them afterwards
and so this I'm not going to go through

00:06:40.089 --> 00:06:40.099
and so this I'm not going to go through
 

00:06:40.099 --> 00:06:41.469
and so this I'm not going to go through
so much detail but this leads to

00:06:41.469 --> 00:06:41.479
so much detail but this leads to
 

00:06:41.479 --> 00:06:42.999
so much detail but this leads to
significant waste we don't know

00:06:42.999 --> 00:06:43.009
significant waste we don't know
 

00:06:43.009 --> 00:06:44.649
significant waste we don't know
great data which is really one of our

00:06:44.649 --> 00:06:44.659
great data which is really one of our
 

00:06:44.659 --> 00:06:47.109
great data which is really one of our
primary recommendations that at the US

00:06:47.109 --> 00:06:47.119
primary recommendations that at the US
 

00:06:47.119 --> 00:06:48.820
primary recommendations that at the US
like other countries that are concerned

00:06:48.820 --> 00:06:48.830
like other countries that are concerned
 

00:06:48.830 --> 00:06:51.299
like other countries that are concerned
about this should be monitoring and

00:06:51.299 --> 00:06:51.309
about this should be monitoring and
 

00:06:51.309 --> 00:06:55.689
about this should be monitoring and
following data on this topic we have

00:06:55.689 --> 00:06:55.699
following data on this topic we have
 

00:06:55.699 --> 00:06:58.869
following data on this topic we have
data from businesses in 2001 nine

00:06:58.869 --> 00:06:58.879
data from businesses in 2001 nine
 

00:06:58.879 --> 00:07:00.369
data from businesses in 2001 nine
hundred million dollars of food was

00:07:00.369 --> 00:07:00.379
hundred million dollars of food was
 

00:07:00.379 --> 00:07:02.200
hundred million dollars of food was
thrown away before it was sold because

00:07:02.200 --> 00:07:02.210
thrown away before it was sold because
 

00:07:02.210 --> 00:07:04.299
thrown away before it was sold because
of dates expiring you know fifteen years

00:07:04.299 --> 00:07:04.309
of dates expiring you know fifteen years
 

00:07:04.309 --> 00:07:05.939
of dates expiring you know fifteen years
later that has to be way more than that

00:07:05.939 --> 00:07:05.949
later that has to be way more than that
 

00:07:05.949 --> 00:07:10.029
later that has to be way more than that
and then the as I said this this date is

00:07:10.029 --> 00:07:10.039
and then the as I said this this date is
 

00:07:10.039 --> 00:07:11.679
and then the as I said this this date is
not linked to safety and in fact there's

00:07:11.679 --> 00:07:11.689
not linked to safety and in fact there's
 

00:07:11.689 --> 00:07:13.510
not linked to safety and in fact there's
not been a single instance of foodborne

00:07:13.510 --> 00:07:13.520

00:07:19.789 --> 00:07:21.249
have said that they've thrown food away
on that date because they're afraid it's

00:07:21.249 --> 00:07:21.259
on that date because they're afraid it's
 

00:07:21.259 --> 00:07:23.829
on that date because they're afraid it's
unsafe and many people also will eat

00:07:23.829 --> 00:07:23.839
unsafe and many people also will eat
 

00:07:23.839 --> 00:07:25.510
unsafe and many people also will eat
food up until the date no matter what

00:07:25.510 --> 00:07:25.520
food up until the date no matter what
 

00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:26.920
food up until the date no matter what
happened to it because they're fearful

00:07:26.920 --> 00:07:26.930
happened to it because they're fearful
 

00:07:26.930 --> 00:07:29.049
happened to it because they're fearful
that they believe that the food is

00:07:29.049 --> 00:07:29.059
that they believe that the food is
 

00:07:29.059 --> 00:07:30.790
that they believe that the food is
protected like that data is a special

00:07:30.790 --> 00:07:30.800
protected like that data is a special
 

00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:33.249
protected like that data is a special
halo that makes it safe until then so

00:07:33.249 --> 00:07:33.259
halo that makes it safe until then so
 

00:07:33.259 --> 00:07:35.980
halo that makes it safe until then so
this isn't contributing to safety and so

00:07:35.980 --> 00:07:35.990
this isn't contributing to safety and so
 

00:07:35.990 --> 00:07:38.559
this isn't contributing to safety and so
