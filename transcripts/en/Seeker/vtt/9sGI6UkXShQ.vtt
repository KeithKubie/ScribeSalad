00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:06.990
About 4.3 light-years from Earth lies our
closest stellar neighborhood.

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:10.800
The Alpha Centauri system consists of three
known stars.

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:15.682
Alpha Centauri A and Alpha Centauri B are
a binary pair, which means

00:00:15.682 --> 00:00:18.740
they orbit a common center of mass.

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:26.860
The third star, Proxima Centauri, is the closest
to Earth at about 4.22 light-years away.

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:32.770
In 2016, astronomers detected an Earth-sized
planet orbiting Proxima Centauri within the

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:38.720
star's habitable zone - the right distance
to potentially support liquid water on its surface.

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:45.580
Which is why eyes are on Alpha Centauri as
our first destination once we master interstellar travel.

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:49.620
So is this deep space journey possible in our lifetime?

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:53.360
And if so, how will we get there?

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:56.280
Outer space is bigger than we can comprehend

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:00.580
and sending a spacecraft into its depths takes a lot of time.

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:04.680
NASA's Voyager 1 is Earth's farthest spacecraft
to date.

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:11.880
It was launched in 1977, and in 2012, it was
the first craft to enter interstellar space.

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:16.740
If Voyager 1 was pointed in the direction
of Alpha Centauri, it would still take tens

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:19.660
of thousands of years to reach the system.

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:24.500
And that's because its propulsion system is
not ideal for deep space travel.

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:29.620
So clearly we need a faster way to get to our stellar neighbors.

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:35.860
Some scientists believe that our best attempt
at interstellar travel are lightsails.

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:39.720
These sails would be made of ultra-thin sheets
that will be propelled

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:42.420
using light instead of wind.

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:48.220
One of the major initiatives researching their
potential is Breakthrough Starshot.

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:54.540
The program, initially backed by late cosmologist
Stephen Hawking, aims to create a nanocraft

00:01:54.540 --> 00:02:00.159
comprised of a lightsail and a gram-scale
wafer that hosts a number of instruments

00:02:00.159 --> 00:02:02.799
called a StarChip.

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:07.540
The nanocraft has a mirror-like sail design
and is measured at 10 square meters with a

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:10.380
mass of less than 1 gram.

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:13.860
By comparison a penny weighs 2.5 grams,

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:16.960
so these spacecraft will be ultralight.

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:21.840
The lightsail will purportedly be accelerated
by laser radiation pressure from Earth at

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:25.200
about 20 percent the speed of light.

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:31.260
The planned laser array, called a Light Beamer,
will fire beams as powerful as 100 gigawatts

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:35.210
of specific wavelengths of near-infrared light.

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:40.100
The nanocraft sail would need to reflect a
huge majority of the laser light to avoid

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:43.440
instantly burning up on contact.

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:47.900
The idea is to launch thousands of nanocraft
at once to increase the chances that at least

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:52.080
a few will conquer the elements and reach
Alpha Centauri.

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:57.510
If they do make it, it's estimated, the
journey will only take around 20 years.

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:02.260
Though some critics are skeptical about the
ability to execute Breakthrough Starshot,

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:06.920
some of the world's greatest minds are actively
working to make it a reality.

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:11.340
The project is pushing the boundaries of science,
challenging humans to create an entirely new

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:15.320
material that meets all the extreme needs
of the lightsails

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:18.900
and to design the largest laser ever constructed.

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:23.820
But, if engineers and scientists are able
perfect these pint-sized spacecraft and we

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:29.050
achieve interstellar travel, humanity will
be rewarded with an entirely new understanding

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:32.120
of the alien worlds beyond our own.

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:36.520
