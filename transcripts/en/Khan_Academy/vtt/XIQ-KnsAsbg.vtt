00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:01.930
Welcome back.

00:00:01.930 --> 00:00:05.460
I'm now going to do some more
examples of a bit of a review

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:07.300
of some of the derivatives
that we've been seeing.

00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:09.450
And then I'll introduce you to
something called the chain rule

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:13.080
which expands the universe of
the types of functions we can

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:14.290
take the derivatives of.

00:00:14.290 --> 00:00:18.540
So in the last presentation, I
showed you how to function if I

00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:30.270
had f of x is equal to 10x to
the seventh plus 6x to the

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:39.330
third plus 15x minus
x to the 16th.

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:42.160
To take the derivative of this
entire function, we take just

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:43.840
the derivatives of each
of the pieces, right?

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:45.640
Because you can add them up.

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:51.560
So f prime of x in this
example, is equal to-- and

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:52.755
I think you get the hang
of it at this point.

00:00:52.755 --> 00:00:54.150
It's actually fairly
straightforward.

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:56.480
We take the 7, multiply
it by the 10.

00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:01.620
So we get 70x, then
1 degree less.

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:10.940
So 70x to the sixth plus
18x squared plus 15.

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:13.010
We can kind of view this
as x to the 1, right?

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:16.920
So it's 1 times 15
times x to the 0.

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:17.550
Which is 1.

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:23.840
So that's just 15 minus
16x to the 15th.

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:25.330
And I don't want you to
lose sight of what we're

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:26.090
actually doing here.

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:27.870
What is f prime of x?

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:32.770
This is the function the tells
us the slope of any point

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:35.450
x, along the curve f of x.

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:37.860
It's a pretty
interesting thing.

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:40.795
Let me just draw to maybe give
you a little bit of intuition.

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:47.490
I don't know what the slope
of f of x really looks like.

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:49.560
And actually, let's pretend
like this isn't f of x.

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:51.360
Let's pretend like this
is just some arbitrary

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.270
function I'm drawing.

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:56.210
If this is f of x, just some
curve that does all sorts of

00:01:56.210 --> 00:02:01.430
crazy things, f prime of x
tells me the slope at any

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:02.810
point along that line.

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:09.950
So if I wanted to know the
slope at this point right here,

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:13.060
I could use the derivative
function to figure out the

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:15.120
slope of the tangent line.

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:18.740
The tangent line is something
like that right there.

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:21.930
Or if I wanted to figure out
the slope at this point,

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:23.890
once again I'd use the
derivative function.

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:26.340
And it would tell me the
slope of the tangent

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:27.100
line at that point.

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:29.150
Which would be
something like that.

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:30.960
So it's a pretty useful thing.

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:34.900
And once I give you all the
tools to analytically solve a

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:36.560
whole host of derivatives, then
we'll actually do a bunch

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:39.140
of word problems and
applications of derivatives.

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:41.270
And I think you'll see that
it's a really, really,

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:42.700
really useful concept.

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:43.600
So let's move on.

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:45.960
I think you get the idea of
how to do these derivatives

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:48.610
of polynomials.

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:49.760
Let me erase this.

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:52.650
I'm actually using a
different tool now.

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:56.110
So I think it might
be a bit easier.

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:57.630
Let's see, someone
was calling me.

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:00.520
But you're more important so
I will not answer the phone.

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:11.640
I'm going to introduce you--
this tool doesn't have, I

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:14.330
don't think it has a
straight up eraser.

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:15.230
Actually, maybe let's see.

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:16.350
If I do it like this.

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:28.400
Oh let me see.

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:32.150
No that doesn't work.

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:36.080
Let me just erase like this,
the old-fashioned way.

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:41.000
You just have to bear with me.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:45.280
And then once I finish erasing,
I will show you the chain rule.

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:45.900
This is good.

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:48.410
It feels like I'm a real
teacher with a real chalkboard

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:49.490
and a real eraser now.

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:56.750
This is a lot cleaner than a
normal chalkboard as well.

00:03:56.750 --> 00:04:00.960
Bear with me, almost there.

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:02.630
I'll figure out a faster
way to do this over the

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:04.590
next couple of videos.

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:05.210
It's pretty sad.

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:07.670
I'm showing you how to do
derivatives in calculus, but

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:10.910
I don't know how to erase
a faster way than this.

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:15.560
There, we're done.

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:15.900
OK.

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:18.290
So now I'm going show you how
to solve the derivatives of a

00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:21.360
slightly more complicated
type of a function.

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:23.080
It's actually not
more complicated.

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:24.450
It's just different.

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:42.890
So let's say f of x is equal to
2x plus 3 to the fifth power.

00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:45.220
And I want to figure out
the derivative of this.

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:46.320
We're going to use something
called the chain rule.

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:49.020
Because one thing we could do,
we could just multiply out 2x

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:50.600
plus 3 to the fifth power.

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:54.420
And if you've ever done
that, you know it's a pain.

00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:55.540
So that's not something
we'd want to do.

00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:57.280
So we're going to use something
called the chain rule.

00:04:57.280 --> 00:04:59.390
And I'm just going to give you
a bunch of examples before I

00:04:59.390 --> 00:05:01.060
even show you the definition
of the chain rule.

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:02.330
Because I think this is
something that you just

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:04.260
have to learn by example.

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:07.110
So the chain rule just tells us
that the derivative of let's

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:10.820
say this function right here.

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:14.100
You take the derivative of the
subfunctions, and then you can

00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:16.000
take a derivative of
the entire function.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:17.290
I'll tell you that formally.

00:05:17.290 --> 00:05:19.010
But I think when you introduce
it formally, it gets

00:05:19.010 --> 00:05:19.890
more confusing.

00:05:19.890 --> 00:05:23.455
So what I do, I just take the
derivative of 2x plus 3 first.

00:05:23.455 --> 00:05:25.000
And actually let me use colors.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:26.730
I think that might simplify it.

00:05:26.730 --> 00:05:29.510
So I take the derivative
of 2x plus 3.

00:05:29.510 --> 00:05:31.350
What's the derivative
of 2x plus 3?

00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:32.130
Well you know that.

00:05:32.130 --> 00:05:36.470
It's just the derivative
of 2x, which is 2.

00:05:36.470 --> 00:05:37.860
And then the
derivative of 3 is 0.

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:41.300
So the derivative of
2x plus 3 is just 2.

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:45.030
And then I'm going to multiply
that times the derivative

00:05:45.030 --> 00:05:46.150
of the whole thing.

00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:48.930
And I just pretend like
2x plus 3 is just like

00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:51.060
a variable by itself.

00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:54.620
So then what's the derivative
of x to the fifth?

00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:56.630
Well the derivative of x to the
fifth-- I'm going to do that in

00:05:56.630 --> 00:06:00.366
a different color-- the
derivative of x to the

00:06:00.366 --> 00:06:05.590
fifth is 5x to the fourth.

00:06:05.590 --> 00:06:13.270
So it'll be 5 times
something to the fourth.

00:06:13.270 --> 00:06:15.760
But here we didn't take the
derivative of x the fifth.

00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:18.010
We took the derivative of
2x plus 3 to the fifth.

00:06:18.010 --> 00:06:20.280
So we just put the 2x
plus 3 there instead.

00:06:24.230 --> 00:06:26.190
So what did we do here?

00:06:26.190 --> 00:06:29.290
We went in the inside of
the function, and we took

00:06:29.290 --> 00:06:29.860
the derivative here.

00:06:29.860 --> 00:06:32.570
And the derivative of
2x plus 3 was just 2.

00:06:32.570 --> 00:06:35.570
And then we multiplied
it by the derivative of

00:06:35.570 --> 00:06:36.460
the greater function.

00:06:36.460 --> 00:06:38.980
And we just pretended like the
2x plus 3 was a variable.

00:06:38.980 --> 00:06:40.120
It was like x.

00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:44.410
So instead of 5x to the
fourth, we got 5 times

00:06:44.410 --> 00:06:46.170
2x plus 3 to the fourth.

00:06:46.170 --> 00:06:51.540
And if we just simplify that,
f prime of x is equal to

00:06:51.540 --> 00:06:58.220
2 times 5 is 10; 10 times
2x plus 3 to the fourth.

00:06:58.220 --> 00:07:01.650
That was a lot simpler than
multiplying out 2x plus 3 to

00:07:01.650 --> 00:07:04.260
the fifth power, and then doing
the derivatives the old way.

00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:06.080
I know this was probably a
little confusing to you,

00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:09.270
so I'm going to try to do
a couple more examples.

00:07:09.270 --> 00:07:25.570
Let's say I had g of x is equal
to x-squared plus 2x plus

00:07:25.570 --> 00:07:30.620
3 to the eighth power.

00:07:30.620 --> 00:07:36.430
So g prime of x is going to
equal-- well what did we say?

00:07:36.430 --> 00:07:38.090
We take the derivative
of the inside.

00:07:38.090 --> 00:07:40.260
This is called the chain rule.

00:07:40.260 --> 00:07:41.410
What's the derivative
of the inside?

00:07:41.410 --> 00:07:48.250
It's 2x plus 2 plus 0, right?

00:07:48.250 --> 00:07:50.190
And then we take the derivative
of the whole thing.

00:07:50.190 --> 00:07:53.100
And we just pretend like this
whole expression, x-squared

00:07:53.100 --> 00:07:57.540
plus 2x plus 3 is just kind
of like the variable x.

00:07:57.540 --> 00:07:59.590
We know that the derivative
of x to the eighth is

00:07:59.590 --> 00:08:01.520
8x to the seventh.

00:08:01.520 --> 00:08:07.410
So it'll be 8 times
something to the seventh.

00:08:07.410 --> 00:08:10.580
And that something is this
entire expression here, 8 times

00:08:10.580 --> 00:08:15.660
x-squared plus 2x plus 3.

00:08:15.660 --> 00:08:17.040
I hope I didn't
confuse you too much.

00:08:17.040 --> 00:08:18.790
And you can simplify
this more in any way.

00:08:18.790 --> 00:08:21.900
Because it's 2x plus 2 times
8 times x-squared plus 2x

00:08:21.900 --> 00:08:23.035
plus 3 to the seventh.

00:08:23.035 --> 00:08:26.300
To multiply this out, or
to multiply this out is

00:08:26.300 --> 00:08:27.800
a huge pain as you know.

00:08:27.800 --> 00:08:30.840
But we could simplify
a little bit.

00:08:30.840 --> 00:08:33.630
Let me draw a divider here.

00:08:33.630 --> 00:08:44.526
We could say that that equals 8
times 2x, 16x plus 16 times--

00:08:44.526 --> 00:08:48.300
I'm making it really messy--
x-squared plus 2x plus 3

00:08:48.300 --> 00:08:50.610
to the seventh power.

00:08:50.610 --> 00:08:51.870
I hope I didn't
confuse you too much.

00:08:51.870 --> 00:08:53.920
In the next presentation, I'm
just going to do a ton of

00:08:53.920 --> 00:08:55.500
examples using the chain rule.

00:08:55.500 --> 00:08:57.850
And I think the more examples
you see, it's going to

00:08:57.850 --> 00:08:58.470
hit the point home.

00:08:58.470 --> 00:09:00.440
And then after I've done a
bunch of examples, then I'm

00:09:00.440 --> 00:09:01.960
going to give you a
formal definition.

00:09:01.960 --> 00:09:04.190
I think that's actually an
easier way to digest the chain

00:09:04.190 --> 00:09:06.970
rule than giving you the formal
definition first, and then

00:09:06.970 --> 00:09:08.440
showing you a bunch
of examples.

00:09:08.440 --> 00:09:10.520
So I'll see you in the
next presentation.
