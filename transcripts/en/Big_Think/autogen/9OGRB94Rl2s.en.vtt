edx is a learning destination where we

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:06.720
edx is a learning destination where we
 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:09.320
edx is a learning destination where we
have learners from ages of 8 years old

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:09.330
have learners from ages of 8 years old
 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:13.310
have learners from ages of 8 years old
to 295 years old on our platform and so

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:13.320
to 295 years old on our platform and so
 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:15.169
to 295 years old on our platform and so
we've always had this interest in having

00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:15.179
we've always had this interest in having
 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:17.779
we've always had this interest in having
a diverse set of courses whether at the

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:17.789
a diverse set of courses whether at the
 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:19.990
a diverse set of courses whether at the
high school level or university level

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:20.000
high school level or university level
 

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.410
high school level or university level
professional education and so on a lot

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:24.420
professional education and so on a lot
 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:25.849
professional education and so on a lot
of a course is right now university

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859
of a course is right now university
 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:28.189
of a course is right now university
level courses and and learners are

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199
level courses and and learners are
 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:31.070
level courses and and learners are
looking for more basic courses you know

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080
looking for more basic courses you know
 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:32.840
looking for more basic courses you know
they lack many of the prerequisites and

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850
they lack many of the prerequisites and
 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:35.180
they lack many of the prerequisites and
some of these prerequisites courses come

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190
some of these prerequisites courses come
 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:36.950
some of these prerequisites courses come
from come from high schools and so

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960
from come from high schools and so
 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:38.959
from come from high schools and so
therefore it's really important that we

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969
therefore it's really important that we
 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:41.240
therefore it's really important that we
get the high school courses on the

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250
get the high school courses on the
 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:43.970
get the high school courses on the
platform certainly high school level

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980
platform certainly high school level
 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.430
platform certainly high school level
courses very basic courses are more

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440
courses very basic courses are more
 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.170
courses very basic courses are more
challenging from universities because

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180
challenging from universities because
 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.450
challenging from universities because
universities tend to focus on courses

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460
universities tend to focus on courses
 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.810
universities tend to focus on courses
that are the university level and so so

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820
that are the university level and so so
 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.360
that are the university level and so so
with organizations like James and up and

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370
with organizations like James and up and
 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:58.549
with organizations like James and up and
high schools and so on we have the

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559
high schools and so on we have the
 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:00.049
high schools and so on we have the
opportunity to get high school level

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059
opportunity to get high school level
 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:02.119
opportunity to get high school level
courses that are that can be more

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129
courses that are that can be more
 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:04.450
courses that are that can be more
on-ramps can serve as on-ramps to

00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:04.460
on-ramps can serve as on-ramps to
 

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:07.609
on-ramps can serve as on-ramps to
university level courses the challenges

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619
university level courses the challenges
 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:09.740
university level courses the challenges
are posed with the high school level of

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750
are posed with the high school level of
 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:13.160
are posed with the high school level of
courses is that high schools very often

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170
courses is that high schools very often
 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.679
courses is that high schools very often
don't have the resources or video

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689
don't have the resources or video
 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:17.929
don't have the resources or video
production capabilities and so on to

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939
production capabilities and so on to
 

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:20.210
production capabilities and so on to
create some of these quality quality

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220
create some of these quality quality
 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:23.450
create some of these quality quality
courses and so there tends to be more of

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460
courses and so there tends to be more of
 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.850
courses and so there tends to be more of
an issue of how do you how do you do the

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860
an issue of how do you how do you do the
 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:27.380
an issue of how do you how do you do the
production how do you provide the

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390
production how do you provide the
 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.330
production how do you provide the
support for courses like this so our

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340
support for courses like this so our
 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.609
support for courses like this so our
thinking there is that EDX has a

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619
thinking there is that EDX has a
 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:34.190
thinking there is that EDX has a
services team we are very interested in

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200
services team we are very interested in
 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:37.580
services team we are very interested in
getting what are called Advanced

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590
getting what are called Advanced
 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:40.399
getting what are called Advanced
Placement level courses in the US so one

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409
Placement level courses in the US so one
 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:42.050
Placement level courses in the US so one
example is that we could use our

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060
example is that we could use our
 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.210
example is that we could use our
production team to provide support for

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220
production team to provide support for
 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:45.710
production team to provide support for
some of these some of these courses

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720
some of these some of these courses
 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:48.520
some of these some of these courses
we're also looking for funding from

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:48.530
we're also looking for funding from
 

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:50.510
we're also looking for funding from
philanthropists and and other

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520
philanthropists and and other
 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.520
philanthropists and and other
foundations that might be able to

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530
foundations that might be able to
 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:55.249
foundations that might be able to
provide the funding for these courses we

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259
provide the funding for these courses we
 

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:57.620
provide the funding for these courses we
can then partner with high schools or

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630
can then partner with high schools or
 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:00.560
can then partner with high schools or
other organizations like gems that can

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570
other organizations like gems that can
 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:03.530
other organizations like gems that can
then create these courses gems for

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:03.540
then create these courses gems for
 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:06.609
then create these courses gems for
example has a large cadre of teachers

00:02:06.609 --> 00:02:06.619
example has a large cadre of teachers
 

00:02:06.619 --> 00:02:09.949
example has a large cadre of teachers
that are already providing offering

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:09.959
that are already providing offering
 

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:12.559
that are already providing offering
courses in a number of areas and so an

00:02:12.559 --> 00:02:12.569
courses in a number of areas and so an
 

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:13.830
courses in a number of areas and so an
organization like gem

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:13.840
organization like gem
 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:15.690
organization like gem
is a natural one to partner to get these

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:15.700
is a natural one to partner to get these
 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:18.300
is a natural one to partner to get these
high school courses but we also are

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:18.310
high school courses but we also are
 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:22.380
high school courses but we also are
thinking about courses that are before

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:22.390
thinking about courses that are before
 

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:24.330
thinking about courses that are before
the Advanced Placement level I think of

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:24.340
the Advanced Placement level I think of
 

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:27.180
the Advanced Placement level I think of
pre-algebra for example and we're also

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:27.190
pre-algebra for example and we're also
 

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:29.339
pre-algebra for example and we're also
developing a lot of tools that will

00:02:29.339 --> 00:02:29.349
developing a lot of tools that will
 

00:02:29.349 --> 00:02:33.360
developing a lot of tools that will
enable students to do simulations and

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:33.370
enable students to do simulations and
 

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:35.610
enable students to do simulations and
various kinds of online laboratories and

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:35.620
various kinds of online laboratories and
 

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:37.320
various kinds of online laboratories and
that tends to be a challenge as well and

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:37.330
that tends to be a challenge as well and
 

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:40.710
that tends to be a challenge as well and
we are looking to develop a small team

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:40.720
we are looking to develop a small team
 

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:43.670
we are looking to develop a small team
within EDX that can create some of these

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:43.680
within EDX that can create some of these
 

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:53.220
within EDX that can create some of these
enriched content types as well so STEM

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:53.230
enriched content types as well so STEM
 

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:55.920
enriched content types as well so STEM
subjects versus humanities subjects tend

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:55.930
subjects versus humanities subjects tend
 

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:58.020
subjects versus humanities subjects tend
to have different kinds of components

00:02:58.020 --> 00:02:58.030
to have different kinds of components
 

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:00.990
to have different kinds of components
that you need in the stem area one of

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:01.000
that you need in the stem area one of
 

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:02.520
that you need in the stem area one of
the areas that that tends to be

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:02.530
the areas that that tends to be
 

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:05.369
the areas that that tends to be
challenging are laboratories how do you

00:03:05.369 --> 00:03:05.379
challenging are laboratories how do you
 

00:03:05.379 --> 00:03:06.809
challenging are laboratories how do you
provide the kind of hands-on laboratory

00:03:06.809 --> 00:03:06.819
provide the kind of hands-on laboratory
 

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:10.710
provide the kind of hands-on laboratory
experience at EDX we've created online

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:10.720
experience at EDX we've created online
 

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:13.949
experience at EDX we've created online
labs that we call you know virtual

00:03:13.949 --> 00:03:13.959
labs that we call you know virtual
 

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:15.479
labs that we call you know virtual
laboratories based on simulation

00:03:15.479 --> 00:03:15.489
laboratories based on simulation
 

00:03:15.489 --> 00:03:19.740
laboratories based on simulation
technology so their students can have a

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:19.750
technology so their students can have a
 

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:22.349
technology so their students can have a
game-like experience as they work with

00:03:22.349 --> 00:03:22.359
game-like experience as they work with
 

00:03:22.359 --> 00:03:24.150
game-like experience as they work with
the circuits lab or as the work with the

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:24.160
the circuits lab or as the work with the
 

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:26.970
the circuits lab or as the work with the
chemistry lab or on in physics you know

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:26.980
chemistry lab or on in physics you know
 

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:29.520
chemistry lab or on in physics you know
they can work with an object like a

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:29.530
they can work with an object like a
 

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:31.500
they can work with an object like a
pendulum so they can set the object at

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:31.510
pendulum so they can set the object at
 

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:33.809
pendulum so they can set the object at
various places and see how it how it

00:03:33.809 --> 00:03:33.819
various places and see how it how it
 

00:03:33.819 --> 00:03:36.330
various places and see how it how it
moves around all through simulations so

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:36.340
moves around all through simulations so
 

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:38.190
moves around all through simulations so
been able to use simulation technology

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:38.200
been able to use simulation technology
 

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:40.470
been able to use simulation technology
to provide a rich game-like experience

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:40.480
to provide a rich game-like experience
 

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:46.379
to provide a rich game-like experience
for the labs in STEM subjects now let's

00:03:46.379 --> 00:03:46.389
for the labs in STEM subjects now let's
 

00:03:46.389 --> 00:03:47.789
for the labs in STEM subjects now let's
understand that you know not everything

00:03:47.789 --> 00:03:47.799
understand that you know not everything
 

00:03:47.799 --> 00:03:49.379
understand that you know not everything
is possible to do so for example in

00:03:49.379 --> 00:03:49.389
is possible to do so for example in
 

00:03:49.389 --> 00:03:52.020
is possible to do so for example in
chemistry it is hard to capture the SMAP

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:52.030
chemistry it is hard to capture the SMAP
 

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:53.970
chemistry it is hard to capture the SMAP
but you can certainly look at color and

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:53.980
but you can certainly look at color and
 

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:56.520
but you can certainly look at color and
some of the other other compositional

00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:56.530
some of the other other compositional
 

00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:59.699
some of the other other compositional
issues as you are titrate different

00:03:59.699 --> 00:03:59.709
issues as you are titrate different
 

00:03:59.709 --> 00:04:01.770
issues as you are titrate different
chemicals and various quantities and so

00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:01.780
chemicals and various quantities and so
 

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:04.199
chemicals and various quantities and so
on now in the humanities side there are

00:04:04.199 --> 00:04:04.209
