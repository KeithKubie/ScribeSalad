00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:02.719
So today, we've talked about explanation-based learning,

00:00:02.719 --> 00:00:06.420
a type of learning where we learn new connections between existing concepts.

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:07.965
We first talked about our concept space.

00:00:07.965 --> 00:00:10.028
A space of information that enables us to draw inferences and

00:00:10.028 --> 00:00:14.924
connections about existing concepts. We then talked about how prior knowledge is

00:00:14.924 --> 00:00:18.712
mapped onto this concept space for new reasoning. Then we talked about how we

00:00:18.712 --> 00:00:22.700
may abstract over prior knowledge to discern transferable nuggets. And how we

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:26.770
might then transfer those nuggets onto the new problem we encounter. Next time,

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:29.670
we'll expand on this idea of transfer to talk about analogical reasoning,

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:33.360
which is inherently transfer-based. Explanation-based learning will also come up

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.510
significantly in learning about correcting mistakes and

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:38.180
in diagnosis. So feel free to jump ahead into those lessons,

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:39.790
if you're interested in continuing with this example.
