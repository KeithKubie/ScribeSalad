00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:04.700
&gt;&gt; From the Library of Congress
in Washington, D.C.

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:20.270 position:61%
&gt;&gt; Hey, how did you distinguish what
was accurate and what was not accurate?

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:21.320
&gt;&gt; You know, it comes with time.

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:22.700
Do you know people who cook?

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:23.900
Who are good cooks?

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:24.270
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:27.400 position:58%
&gt;&gt; And you know how like they can say
a pinch of this and a pinch of that

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:29.380 position:67%
and you just wonder how did you learn that?

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:32.010
In the beginning, they used to
read a recipe and follow it.

00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:33.280
So it's just like that.

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:35.450
You just develop or imagine.

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:39.350 position:61%
In athletics, I think, there's a point
I guess when Michael Jordan didn't have

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:41.260 position:56%
to think about a layup or something.

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:46.120 position:61%
So I think it's just you work muscles
enough and then your hunch gets better.

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:47.670 position:58%
The more you read, the more you know.

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:50.840
Also too, you have to have
expert people to go to.

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:52.280
People to go to whom you trust.

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:55.680
For example, if I'm doing something
on Civil War reconstruction,

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:01.740 position:72%
I'm going to mispronounce his name, but one of
my to go guys is Eric Foner because I found,

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:05.660 position:59%
not that's he's infallible but I found
in time that he's very reasonable.

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:11.360
And to me, he seems like he
wants to tell the true story.

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:14.350
I mean, he doesn't try to make
someone look better than they are.

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:17.960 position:72%
Like his take on Lincoln, he says, "Look, a
lot of people like to read him from the back,"

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:20.850
in saying in other words
because they're uncomfortable

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:22.670 position:69%
with certain positions that he took in life.

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:26.010 position:72%
So I found him to be very honest and balanced.

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:29.730
So I tended to go to him when I was
working my book on "The New Deal.

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:31.040
FDR's Alphabet Soup."

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:35.730 position:56%
I had the book "Freedom from Fear"
by -- I'm going to mess up his name.

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:37.510
His last name is Kennedy.

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:40.620
So I said to a friend of mine who
teaches history at Howard, I said,

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:42.210 position:56%
"Is this a good," He said, "Oh yeah.

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:44.400
I studied with him in college.

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:45.810
He's good."

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:50.400 position:61%
So that's the other thing too, is I
have friends who are trained historians

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:55.040 position:72%
that sometimes I can go to and say, "Is this
a good source," or "Who should I read to get,"

00:01:55.040 --> 00:02:01.480
and also too, see I get like a dog
with a bone when I'm on a project.

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:05.020
So D.C. Archives, you know, I
email people and call people,

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:10.400 position:73%
and that's what I always remind young scholars
to do is that people at libraries, at archives,

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:13.850
at all these institutions,
they live to help people.

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:15.560 position:70%
As long as they know that you're not trifling

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:18.280
and you don't just want to
get somebody to do your work.

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:19.200
So I don't know.

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:22.090
So I'll say, "Well, do you
have a photo of this,"

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:25.130 position:73%
or "Do you know anything about this," you know?

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:26.530
Such and such.

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:31.240
So I just pursue experts and
trying to get them to help me.

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:35.190 position:70%
And most of the time, I'm pretty successful
because I was always say, even when checkout,

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:38.250
"Here's my website," so they
can see that I'm legitimate.

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:42.110
And people sometimes write me and
say, "Do you know such and such

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:43.310 position:56%
with [inaudible] known this person."

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:46.670
I say, "Well I think probably so
because blah, blah, blah, blah."

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:47.320
You know?

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:48.850
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:52.710
&gt;&gt; This has been a presentation
of the Library of Congress.
