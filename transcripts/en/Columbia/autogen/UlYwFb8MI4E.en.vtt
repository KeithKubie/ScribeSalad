you really want to make this work you
 

00:04:41.659 --> 00:04:43.480

these three classes of stakeholders so
 

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:48.879
these three classes of stakeholders so
that's what I want to talk about so we

00:04:48.879 --> 00:04:48.889
that's what I want to talk about so we
 

00:04:48.889 --> 00:04:51.279
that's what I want to talk about so we
had web forms for a while since about

00:04:51.279 --> 00:04:51.289
had web forms for a while since about
 

00:04:51.289 --> 00:04:52.930
had web forms for a while since about
nineteen ninety-six and we changed

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:52.940
nineteen ninety-six and we changed
 

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:54.760
nineteen ninety-six and we changed
something and we rose up a little bit

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:54.770
something and we rose up a little bit
 

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:57.040

of what we mean by that we there's a lot

00:05:01.629 --> 00:05:01.639
of what we mean by that we there's a lot
 

00:05:01.639 --> 00:05:03.219
of what we mean by that we there's a lot
of talk about MOOCs these days we

00:05:03.219 --> 00:05:03.229
of talk about MOOCs these days we
 

00:05:03.229 --> 00:05:04.990
of talk about MOOCs these days we
started to put lectures and courses on

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:05.000
started to put lectures and courses on
 

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.029

00:08:02.770 --> 00:08:02.780
write your own input deck that would be
 

00:08:02.780 --> 00:08:05.230
write your own input deck that would be
a traditional industrial type tool you

00:08:05.230 --> 00:08:05.240
a traditional industrial type tool you
 

00:08:05.240 --> 00:08:07.720
a traditional industrial type tool you
can then do fancy visualizations compare

00:08:07.720 --> 00:08:07.730
can then do fancy visualizations compare
 

00:08:07.730 --> 00:08:10.060
can then do fancy visualizations compare
data we can do that but we can do one

00:08:10.060 --> 00:08:10.070
data we can do that but we can do one
 

00:08:10.070 --> 00:08:11.830
data we can do that but we can do one
better we can actually wrap this same

00:08:11.830 --> 00:08:11.840
better we can actually wrap this same
 

00:08:11.840 --> 00:08:14.260
better we can actually wrap this same
tool and make it a little bit simpler so

00:08:14.260 --> 00:08:14.270
tool and make it a little bit simpler so
 

00:08:14.270 --> 00:08:16.240
tool and make it a little bit simpler so
actually undergrads can design what we

00:08:16.240 --> 00:08:16.250
actually undergrads can design what we
 

00:08:16.250 --> 00:08:18.010
actually undergrads can design what we
call a MOSFET the field effect

00:08:18.010 --> 00:08:18.020

transistor that runs in any of your
 

00:08:19.460 --> 00:08:22.420

computers and we do that for a couple of

00:08:22.420 --> 00:08:22.430
computers and we do that for a couple of
 

00:08:22.430 --> 00:08:24.490
computers and we do that for a couple of
tools and suddenly these tools become

00:08:24.490 --> 00:08:24.500
tools and suddenly these tools become
 

00:08:24.500 --> 00:08:26.320
tools and suddenly these tools become
really usable and we have six thousand

00:08:26.320 --> 00:08:26.330
really usable and we have six thousand
 

00:08:26.330 --> 00:08:29.290
really usable and we have six thousand
users on a tool or on apps that are

00:08:29.300 --> 00:08:32.020
users on a tool or on apps that are
wrapped around a real tool and the real

00:08:33.820 --> 00:08:33.830
gigs really want to run this still here
 

00:08:33.830 --> 00:08:35.440
gigs really want to run this still here
but we have a whole lot more users that

00:08:35.440 --> 00:08:35.450
but we have a whole lot more users that
 

00:08:35.450 --> 00:08:37.690
but we have a whole lot more users that
are out there that run the simple app so

00:08:37.690 --> 00:08:37.700
are out there that run the simple app so
 

00:08:37.700 --> 00:08:40.480
are out there that run the simple app so
user interfaces absolutely critical and

00:08:40.480 --> 00:08:40.490
user interfaces absolutely critical and
 

00:08:40.490 --> 00:08:43.420

when I mentioned we had web forms this

00:08:43.420 --> 00:08:43.430

right that's kind of nice but what's

00:09:04.320 --> 00:09:04.330
right that's kind of nice but what's
 

00:09:04.330 --> 00:09:06.630
right that's kind of nice but what's
even more compelling is this code is

00:09:06.630 --> 00:09:06.640
even more compelling is this code is
 

00:09:06.640 --> 00:09:08.790
even more compelling is this code is
actually an open source code and we

00:09:08.790 --> 00:09:08.800
actually an open source code and we
 

00:09:08.800 --> 00:09:10.710
actually an open source code and we
track the downloads and suddenly the

00:09:10.710 --> 00:09:10.720
track the downloads and suddenly the
 

00:09:10.720 --> 00:09:13.650
track the downloads and suddenly the
downloads of this code also drop so it's

00:09:13.650 --> 00:09:13.660

they're not real tools they're just

gimmicks right

00:11:10.809 --> 00:11:10.819
gimmicks right
 

00:11:10.819 --> 00:11:13.449
gimmicks right
or so they are not real research codes

00:11:13.449 --> 00:11:13.459
or so they are not real research codes
 

00:11:13.459 --> 00:11:15.309
or so they are not real research codes
and can't do real research and maybe I

00:11:15.309 --> 00:11:15.319
and can't do real research and maybe I
 

00:11:15.319 --> 00:11:17.319

can use it for education so we there's

gateways out there alright so what we do
 

00:11:21.949 --> 00:11:23.469
gateways out there alright so what we do
is we actually eliminate this middleman

00:11:23.469 --> 00:11:23.479
is we actually eliminate this middleman
 

00:11:23.479 --> 00:11:25.900
is we actually eliminate this middleman

now the customers out here the question

00:14:12.730 --> 00:14:12.740
now the customers out here the question
 

00:14:12.740 --> 00:14:14.380
now the customers out here the question
is what are they doing because remember

00:14:14.380 --> 00:14:14.390
is what are they doing because remember
 

00:14:14.390 --> 00:14:16.390

you can't use such thing for education

00:14:16.390 --> 00:14:16.400
you can't use such thing for education
 

00:14:16.400 --> 00:14:18.370
you can't use such thing for education
because these are research tools and by

00:14:18.370 --> 00:14:18.380
because these are research tools and by
 

00:14:18.380 --> 00:14:19.510
because these are research tools and by
the way you can use it for research

00:14:19.510 --> 00:14:19.520
the way you can use it for research
 

00:14:19.520 --> 00:14:20.950
the way you can use it for research
because you have to write your own tools

00:14:20.950 --> 00:14:20.960
because you have to write your own tools
 

00:14:20.960 --> 00:14:24.190
because you have to write your own tools
right so how do we measure that we have

00:14:24.190 --> 00:14:24.200
right so how do we measure that we have
 

00:14:24.200 --> 00:14:26.140
right so how do we measure that we have
our own matrix so we have to look into

00:14:26.140 --> 00:14:26.150
our own matrix so we have to look into
 

00:14:26.150 --> 00:14:28.270
our own matrix so we have to look into
the matrix now we actually look at the

00:14:28.270 --> 00:14:28.280
the matrix now we actually look at the
 

00:14:28.280 --> 00:14:30.040
the matrix now we actually look at the
behavior of people because you can't see

00:14:30.040 --> 00:14:30.050
behavior of people because you can't see
 

00:14:30.050 --> 00:14:32.650

we cluster our user by behavior they say

00:14:32.650 --> 00:14:32.660

throughout the whole semester and use

00:14:37.840 --> 00:14:37.850
throughout the whole semester and use
 

00:14:37.850 --> 00:14:39.850
throughout the whole semester and use
one tool throughout a whole semester and

here's a break it's called spring break

00:14:42.070 --> 00:14:42.080
here's a break it's called spring break
 

00:14:42.080 --> 00:14:44.920
here's a break it's called spring break
and then there's one they use one two

00:14:44.920 --> 00:14:44.930
and then there's one they use one two
 

00:14:44.930 --> 00:14:46.570

just set up but a platform where you

00:37:39.819 --> 00:37:39.829
just set up but a platform where you
 

00:37:39.829 --> 00:37:42.900
just set up but a platform where you
could make all of your research outputs

00:37:42.900 --> 00:37:42.910
could make all of your research outputs
 

00:37:42.910 --> 00:37:45.009
could make all of your research outputs
discoverable shareable in sizable and

moment we're saying why would you want
 

00:39:53.329 --> 00:39:54.700
moment we're saying why would you want
to share your research output so unless

00:39:54.700 --> 00:39:54.710
to share your research output so unless
 

00:39:54.710 --> 00:39:56.950
to share your research output so unless
you're someone like me who has a big ego

00:39:56.950 --> 00:39:56.960
you're someone like me who has a big ego
 

00:39:56.960 --> 00:39:59.019
you're someone like me who has a big ego
and wants to make all of the get credit

00:39:59.019 --> 00:39:59.029
and wants to make all of the get credit
 

00:39:59.029 --> 00:40:00.730
and wants to make all of the get credit
for everything so suddenly does that

00:40:00.730 --> 00:40:00.740
for everything so suddenly does that
 

00:40:00.740 --> 00:40:02.500
for everything so suddenly does that
click well maybe every academic has a

00:40:02.500 --> 00:40:02.510
click well maybe every academic has a
 

00:40:02.510 --> 00:40:04.720
click well maybe every academic has a
bit of a nikka so if you can if you can

00:40:04.720 --> 00:40:04.730
bit of a nikka so if you can if you can
 

00:40:04.730 --> 00:40:06.190
bit of a nikka so if you can if you can
give them credit for their research in

00:40:06.190 --> 00:40:06.200
give them credit for their research in
 

00:40:06.200 --> 00:40:08.049
give them credit for their research in
that way so if you can give their

00:40:08.049 --> 00:40:08.059
that way so if you can give their
 

00:40:08.059 --> 00:40:09.579
that way so if you can give their
metrics if you click on this author's

00:40:09.579 --> 00:40:09.589
metrics if you click on this author's
 

00:40:09.589 --> 00:40:11.559
metrics if you click on this author's
name on the right there you will get

00:40:11.559 --> 00:40:11.569
name on the right there you will get
 

00:40:11.569 --> 00:40:13.180
name on the right there you will get
their cumulative metrics for every

00:40:13.180 --> 00:40:13.190
their cumulative metrics for every
 

00:40:13.190 --> 00:40:14.890
their cumulative metrics for every
research output they've shared so if

00:40:14.890 --> 00:40:14.900
research output they've shared so if
 

00:40:14.900 --> 00:40:16.779
research output they've shared so if
they've had 10,000 views for this they

00:40:16.779 --> 00:40:16.789
they've had 10,000 views for this they
 

00:40:16.789 --> 00:40:18.069
they've had 10,000 views for this they
think well if I share another one I'll

00:40:18.069 --> 00:40:18.079
think well if I share another one I'll
 

00:40:18.079 --> 00:40:19.750
think well if I share another one I'll
have 20,000 views and things like this

00:40:19.750 --> 00:40:19.760
have 20,000 views and things like this
 

00:40:19.760 --> 00:40:22.329
have 20,000 views and things like this
and it's just playing into that mindset

00:40:22.329 --> 00:40:22.339
and it's just playing into that mindset
 

00:40:22.339 --> 00:40:27.819
and it's just playing into that mindset
of the academic there so as I said the

00:40:27.819 --> 00:40:27.829
of the academic there so as I said the
 

00:40:27.829 --> 00:40:31.120
of the academic there so as I said the
name is quite confusing fig share we for

00:40:31.120 --> 00:40:31.130
name is quite confusing fig share we for
 

00:40:31.130 --> 00:40:33.250

originally for me so I had a lot of

00:40:33.250 --> 00:40:33.260
originally for me so I had a lot of
 

00:40:33.260 --> 00:40:35.079
originally for me so I had a lot of
negative data that wasn't going to get

00:40:35.079 --> 00:40:35.089
negative data that wasn't going to get
 

00:40:35.089 --> 00:40:36.400
negative data that wasn't going to get
published anywhere so I had all these

00:40:36.400 --> 00:40:36.410
published anywhere so I had all these
 

00:40:36.410 --> 00:40:37.390
published anywhere so I had all these
figures that weren't going to get

00:40:37.390 --> 00:40:37.400
figures that weren't going to get
 

00:40:37.400 --> 00:40:39.190
figures that weren't going to get
published but I did that for a reason it

00:40:39.190 --> 00:40:39.200
published but I did that for a reason it
 

00:40:39.200 --> 00:40:40.960
published but I did that for a reason it
was you know I looked at these cells and

00:40:40.960 --> 00:40:40.970
was you know I looked at these cells and
 

00:40:40.970 --> 00:40:42.730
was you know I looked at these cells and
I added this chemical and was looking at

00:40:42.730 --> 00:40:42.740
I added this chemical and was looking at
 

00:40:42.740 --> 00:40:44.109
I added this chemical and was looking at
receptors to see if the levels went up

00:40:44.109 --> 00:40:44.119
receptors to see if the levels went up
 

00:40:44.119 --> 00:40:46.059
receptors to see if the levels went up
or down and there was no change but I

00:40:46.059 --> 00:40:46.069
or down and there was no change but I
 

00:40:46.069 --> 00:40:48.010
or down and there was no change but I
did that for a reason I thought that my

00:40:48.010 --> 00:40:48.020
did that for a reason I thought that my
 

00:40:48.020 --> 00:40:49.420
did that for a reason I thought that my
hypothesis was there was going to be a

00:40:49.420 --> 00:40:49.430
hypothesis was there was going to be a
 

00:40:49.430 --> 00:40:51.279
hypothesis was there was going to be a
change if I'm doing it particularly in

00:40:51.279 --> 00:40:51.289
change if I'm doing it particularly in
 

00:40:51.289 --> 00:40:52.859
change if I'm doing it particularly in
stem cells which is massively fun

00:40:52.859 --> 00:40:52.869

at the moment then somebody else is

00:40:54.930 --> 00:40:54.940
at the moment then somebody else is
 

00:40:54.940 --> 00:40:56.099
at the moment then somebody else is
going to be doing the same experiment

00:40:56.099 --> 00:40:56.109
going to be doing the same experiment
 

00:40:56.109 --> 00:40:57.239
going to be doing the same experiment
somewhere but you're never going to

write a paper about all your negative

00:40:58.589 --> 00:40:58.599

data who's going to waste three days to
 

00:40:59.980 --> 00:41:01.559
data who's going to waste three days to
hang up a paper so I thought if you can

00:41:01.559 --> 00:41:01.569
hang up a paper so I thought if you can
 

00:41:01.569 --> 00:41:03.390
hang up a paper so I thought if you can
just do something that you know makes it

00:41:03.390 --> 00:41:03.400
just do something that you know makes it
 

00:41:03.400 --> 00:41:06.599

some of the formula formats that we
 

00:41:48.099 --> 00:41:49.950
some of the formula formats that we

ago their supplemental data was just a

00:42:39.390 --> 00:42:39.400
ago their supplemental data was just a
 

00:42:39.400 --> 00:42:41.549
ago their supplemental data was just a
list of the files and you had to if it

00:42:41.549 --> 00:42:41.559
list of the files and you had to if it
 

00:42:41.559 --> 00:42:42.749
list of the files and you had to if it
was a video you clicked it you

00:42:42.749 --> 00:42:42.759
was a video you clicked it you
 

00:42:42.759 --> 00:42:44.370
was a video you clicked it you
downloaded it and then you have to hope

00:42:44.370 --> 00:42:44.380
downloaded it and then you have to hope
 

00:42:44.380 --> 00:42:45.839
downloaded it and then you have to hope
you had the right codecs to play that

00:42:45.839 --> 00:42:45.849
you had the right codecs to play that
 

00:42:45.849 --> 00:42:47.880
you had the right codecs to play that
video which as I say you know the

00:42:47.880 --> 00:42:47.890

internet works for these things we can
do this so we now host all of the

the unknown section for me I have a few

00:46:38.610 --> 00:46:38.620
the unknown section for me I have a few
 

00:46:38.620 --> 00:46:40.410
the unknown section for me I have a few
questions that I was going to mention

00:46:40.410 --> 00:46:40.420
questions that I was going to mention
 

00:46:40.420 --> 00:46:43.470
questions that I was going to mention
just in terms of you know cuz this is a

00:46:43.470 --> 00:46:43.480
just in terms of you know cuz this is a
 

00:46:43.480 --> 00:46:45.120
just in terms of you know cuz this is a
panel might as well have some questions

00:46:45.120 --> 00:46:45.130
panel might as well have some questions
 

00:46:45.130 --> 00:46:47.700
panel might as well have some questions
so you know the Thomson Reuters are

00:46:47.700 --> 00:46:47.710
so you know the Thomson Reuters are
 

00:46:47.710 --> 00:46:49.470
so you know the Thomson Reuters are
doing a data citation index that's going

00:46:49.470 --> 00:46:49.480
doing a data citation index that's going
 

00:46:49.480 --> 00:46:51.150
doing a data citation index that's going
to start tracking these things which is

00:46:51.150 --> 00:46:51.160
to start tracking these things which is
 

00:46:51.160 --> 00:46:53.730
to start tracking these things which is
really interesting because web of

00:46:53.730 --> 00:46:53.740
really interesting because web of
 

00:46:53.740 --> 00:46:55.920
really interesting because web of
science and the you know I've just been

00:46:55.920 --> 00:46:55.930
science and the you know I've just been
 

00:46:55.930 --> 00:46:57.450
science and the you know I've just been
talking about different all metrics do

00:46:57.450 --> 00:46:57.460
talking about different all metrics do
 

00:46:57.460 --> 00:46:59.550
talking about different all metrics do
we really want to go back to that one

00:46:59.550 --> 00:46:59.560
we really want to go back to that one
 

00:46:59.560 --> 00:47:04.980
we really want to go back to that one
measure of impact for data sets well I

00:47:04.980 --> 00:47:04.990
measure of impact for data sets well I
 

00:47:04.990 --> 00:47:06.990
measure of impact for data sets well I
mean they are tracking fig share data

00:47:06.990 --> 00:47:07.000
mean they are tracking fig share data
 

00:47:07.000 --> 00:47:09.420
mean they are tracking fig share data
sets so they're more than welcome to do

00:47:09.420 --> 00:47:09.430
sets so they're more than welcome to do
 

00:47:09.430 --> 00:47:11.610
sets so they're more than welcome to do
that whether that'll be the future of

00:47:11.610 --> 00:47:11.620
that whether that'll be the future of
 

00:47:11.620 --> 00:47:12.930
that whether that'll be the future of
where this goes I don't know I'd love to

00:47:12.930 --> 00:47:12.940
where this goes I don't know I'd love to
 

00:47:12.940 --> 00:47:14.940
where this goes I don't know I'd love to
hear people's opinions same with I've

00:47:14.940 --> 00:47:14.950
hear people's opinions same with I've
 

00:47:14.950 --> 00:47:17.850
hear people's opinions same with I've
just heard about the elsevier new tools

00:47:17.850 --> 00:47:17.860
just heard about the elsevier new tools
 

00:47:17.860 --> 00:47:19.230
just heard about the elsevier new tools
so I'm really interested to hear where

00:47:19.230 --> 00:47:19.240
so I'm really interested to hear where
 

00:47:19.240 --> 00:47:20.490
so I'm really interested to hear where
this goes they said all the data is

00:47:20.490 --> 00:47:20.500
this goes they said all the data is
 

00:47:20.500 --> 00:47:22.230
this goes they said all the data is
going to be open as a priority and

00:47:22.230 --> 00:47:22.240
going to be open as a priority and
 

00:47:22.240 --> 00:47:25.290
going to be open as a priority and
that's really great one thing that I

00:47:25.290 --> 00:47:25.300
that's really great one thing that I
 

00:47:25.300 --> 00:47:26.550
that's really great one thing that I
think has a lot of potential we've had

00:47:26.550 --> 00:47:26.560
think has a lot of potential we've had
 

00:47:26.560 --> 00:47:29.280
think has a lot of potential we've had
mentioned before is orchid so if you're

00:47:29.280 --> 00:47:29.290
mentioned before is orchid so if you're
 

00:47:29.290 --> 00:47:30.750
mentioned before is orchid so if you're
looking at the impact of a researcher

00:47:30.750 --> 00:47:30.760
looking at the impact of a researcher
 

00:47:30.760 --> 00:47:32.890
looking at the impact of a researcher
orchid is basically an ID for a

00:47:32.890 --> 00:47:32.900
orchid is basically an ID for a
 

00:47:32.900 --> 00:47:34.180
orchid is basically an ID for a
researcher a prison number for a

00:47:34.180 --> 00:47:34.190
researcher a prison number for a
 

00:47:34.190 --> 00:47:35.440
researcher a prison number for a
researcher that everything is connected

00:47:35.440 --> 00:47:35.450
researcher that everything is connected
 

00:47:35.450 --> 00:47:38.140
researcher that everything is connected
to them and so you could use that to

00:47:38.140 --> 00:47:38.150
to them and so you could use that to
 

00:47:38.150 --> 00:47:42.100
to them and so you could use that to
start tracking people and seeing what

00:47:42.100 --> 00:47:42.110
start tracking people and seeing what
 

00:47:42.110 --> 00:47:43.510
start tracking people and seeing what
their true impact of all of their

00:47:43.510 --> 00:47:43.520
their true impact of all of their
 

00:47:43.520 --> 00:47:46.510
their true impact of all of their
researches and we're integrated with

00:47:46.510 --> 00:47:46.520
researches and we're integrated with
 

00:47:46.520 --> 00:47:47.440
researches and we're integrated with
that so we're looking forward to see

00:47:47.440 --> 00:47:47.450
that so we're looking forward to see
 

00:47:47.450 --> 00:47:50.230
that so we're looking forward to see
where that goes and then the last thing

00:47:50.230 --> 00:47:50.240
where that goes and then the last thing
 

00:47:50.240 --> 00:47:52.000
where that goes and then the last thing
I wanted to mention was just this you

00:47:52.000 --> 00:47:52.010
I wanted to mention was just this you
 

00:47:52.010 --> 00:47:54.040
I wanted to mention was just this you
know the US government has announced

00:47:54.040 --> 00:47:54.050
know the US government has announced
 

00:47:54.050 --> 00:47:57.580
know the US government has announced
last week the UK is actually ahead of on

00:47:57.580 --> 00:47:57.590
last week the UK is actually ahead of on
 

00:47:57.590 --> 00:47:59.080
last week the UK is actually ahead of on
this front in that we make we're already

00:47:59.080 --> 00:47:59.090
this front in that we make we're already
 

00:47:59.090 --> 00:48:00.580
this front in that we make we're already
making all of our stuff open access

00:48:00.580 --> 00:48:00.590
making all of our stuff open access
 

00:48:00.590 --> 00:48:02.950
making all of our stuff open access
which is great winning it something but

00:48:02.950 --> 00:48:02.960
which is great winning it something but
 

00:48:02.960 --> 00:48:07.540
which is great winning it something but
um the the the US the US will catches it

00:48:07.540 --> 00:48:07.550
um the the the US the US will catches it
 

00:48:07.550 --> 00:48:09.010
um the the the US the US will catches it
no time with this one of the interesting

00:48:09.010 --> 00:48:09.020
no time with this one of the interesting
 

00:48:09.020 --> 00:48:11.550
no time with this one of the interesting
things I wanted to ask everybody here is

00:48:11.550 --> 00:48:11.560
things I wanted to ask everybody here is
 

00:48:11.560 --> 00:48:13.750
things I wanted to ask everybody here is
eventually I talked to a few people

00:48:13.750 --> 00:48:13.760
eventually I talked to a few people
 

00:48:13.760 --> 00:48:16.060
eventually I talked to a few people
about this last night they say that all

00:48:16.060 --> 00:48:16.070
about this last night they say that all
 

00:48:16.070 --> 00:48:17.890
about this last night they say that all
of the papers have to be open access

00:48:17.890 --> 00:48:17.900
of the papers have to be open access
 

00:48:17.900 --> 00:48:20.950
of the papers have to be open access
they don't really say what the embargo

00:48:20.950 --> 00:48:20.960
they don't really say what the embargo
 

00:48:20.960 --> 00:48:22.900
they don't really say what the embargo
period has to be on data so they treat

00:48:22.900 --> 00:48:22.910
period has to be on data so they treat
 

00:48:22.910 --> 00:48:25.150
period has to be on data so they treat
it completely separately still in the in

00:48:25.150 --> 00:48:25.160
it completely separately still in the in
 

00:48:25.160 --> 00:48:27.700
it completely separately still in the in
the release that they gave so I think we

00:48:27.700 --> 00:48:27.710
the release that they gave so I think we
 

00:48:27.710 --> 00:48:29.680
the release that they gave so I think we
should push them to see what are they

00:48:29.680 --> 00:48:29.690
should push them to see what are they
 

00:48:29.690 --> 00:48:31.180
should push them to see what are they
going to do on the data sharing side of

00:48:31.180 --> 00:48:31.190
going to do on the data sharing side of
 

00:48:31.190 --> 00:48:35.470
going to do on the data sharing side of
things the impact side of things how are

00:48:35.470 --> 00:48:35.480
things the impact side of things how are
 

00:48:35.480 --> 00:48:36.850
things the impact side of things how are
we going to manage that and are we going

00:48:36.850 --> 00:48:36.860
we going to manage that and are we going
 

00:48:36.860 --> 00:48:38.470
we going to manage that and are we going
to start tracking these new metrics and

00:48:38.470 --> 00:48:38.480
to start tracking these new metrics and
 

00:48:38.480 --> 00:48:41.170
to start tracking these new metrics and
the last thing I wanted to say was how

00:48:41.170 --> 00:48:41.180
the last thing I wanted to say was how
 

00:48:41.180 --> 00:48:44.290
the last thing I wanted to say was how
are we going to start educating the

00:48:44.290 --> 00:48:44.300
are we going to start educating the
 

00:48:44.300 --> 00:48:46.750
are we going to start educating the
masses about what they can do on my I

00:48:46.750 --> 00:48:46.760

be in a steady state of change for the

we have two phase into them very very

00:56:10.580 --> 00:56:10.590
we have two phase into them very very

graceful so I am so that's I think

00:56:12.980 --> 00:56:12.990
graceful so I am so that's I think
 

00:56:12.990 --> 00:56:14.840
graceful so I am so that's I think
that's that's too nice so for me

00:56:14.840 --> 00:56:14.850
that's that's too nice so for me
 

00:56:14.850 --> 00:56:17.210
that's that's too nice so for me
platforms also they don't allow you to

00:56:17.210 --> 00:56:17.220
platforms also they don't allow you to
 

00:56:17.220 --> 00:56:20.120
platforms also they don't allow you to
escape so for example I did not change

00:56:20.120 --> 00:56:20.130
escape so for example I did not change
 

00:56:20.130 --> 00:56:22.550

all my contacts are with google it is
 

00:56:26.670 --> 00:56:28.670
all my contacts are with google it is
very expensive for me to switch to

yeah there's an inertia and platform so

00:56:32.960 --> 00:56:32.970
yeah there's an inertia and platform so
 

00:56:32.970 --> 00:56:35.420
yeah there's an inertia and platform so
it is difficult for me to see how in

00:56:35.420 --> 00:56:35.430
it is difficult for me to see how in
 

00:56:35.430 --> 00:56:38.060
it is difficult for me to see how in
this environment of fragmentation how

00:56:38.060 --> 00:56:38.070
this environment of fragmentation how
 

00:56:38.070 --> 00:56:40.430
this environment of fragmentation how
you know platforms there by the

00:56:40.430 --> 00:56:40.440
you know platforms there by the
 

00:56:40.440 --> 00:56:43.040
you know platforms there by the
protocols and norms there they work best

00:56:43.040 --> 00:56:43.050
protocols and norms there they work best
 

00:56:43.050 --> 00:56:44.870
protocols and norms there they work best
when there's one platform right when we

00:56:44.870 --> 00:56:44.880
when there's one platform right when we
 

00:56:44.880 --> 00:56:46.850
when there's one platform right when we
are on Facebook that's what that's when

00:56:46.850 --> 00:56:46.860
are on Facebook that's what that's when
 

00:56:46.860 --> 00:56:49.310
are on Facebook that's what that's when
we can do it we go someplace else yeah

00:56:49.310 --> 00:56:49.320
we can do it we go someplace else yeah
 

00:56:49.320 --> 00:56:50.840
we can do it we go someplace else yeah
so that's what I don't get what's this

00:56:50.840 --> 00:56:50.850
so that's what I don't get what's this
 

00:56:50.850 --> 00:56:52.610
so that's what I don't get what's this
different the kind of the final state

00:56:52.610 --> 00:56:52.620
different the kind of the final state
 

00:56:52.620 --> 00:56:54.860
different the kind of the final state
here there must be either huge

00:56:54.860 --> 00:56:54.870

here there must be either huge
integration or just a kind of whittling

integration or just a kind of whittling
 

00:56:58.800 --> 00:57:00.320

clear clear or several winners or
 

00:57:03.150 --> 00:57:04.880
clear clear or several winners or
several alternative and I think that

00:57:04.880 --> 00:57:04.890
several alternative and I think that
 

00:57:04.890 --> 00:57:07.280
several alternative and I think that
will happen the reason I said no when

00:57:07.280 --> 00:57:07.290
will happen the reason I said no when
 

00:57:07.290 --> 00:57:08.750
will happen the reason I said no when
you said do I count all these different

00:57:08.750 --> 00:57:08.760
you said do I count all these different

that there's a feedback mechanism if a

that there's a feedback mechanism if a
 

01:01:06.279 --> 01:01:08.160
that there's a feedback mechanism if a

think part of the challenge with some of

01:01:19.049 --> 01:01:19.059
think part of the challenge with some of
 

01:01:19.059 --> 01:01:22.109
think part of the challenge with some of
your systems right now is there's not

01:01:22.109 --> 01:01:22.119
your systems right now is there's not
 

01:01:22.119 --> 01:01:25.200
your systems right now is there's not
that feedback mechanism and so I think

01:01:25.200 --> 01:01:25.210
that feedback mechanism and so I think
 

01:01:25.210 --> 01:01:28.559
that feedback mechanism and so I think
it would be useful to tell us how your

01:01:28.559 --> 01:01:28.569
it would be useful to tell us how your
 

01:01:28.569 --> 01:01:31.109
it would be useful to tell us how your
projects are funded and what will happen

01:01:31.109 --> 01:01:31.119
projects are funded and what will happen
 

01:01:31.119 --> 01:01:34.499
projects are funded and what will happen
in the longer term when that funding

01:01:34.499 --> 01:01:34.509
in the longer term when that funding
 

01:01:34.509 --> 01:01:40.589
in the longer term when that funding

somebody doesn't misuse it and the

01:15:58.330 --> 01:15:58.340
somebody doesn't misuse it and the
 

01:15:58.340 --> 01:16:02.200
somebody doesn't misuse it and the
answer is largely you can't and so it's

01:16:02.200 --> 01:16:02.210
answer is largely you can't and so it's
 

01:16:02.210 --> 01:16:05.830
answer is largely you can't and so it's
so so some misuse in inappropriate use

01:16:05.830 --> 01:16:05.840
so so some misuse in inappropriate use
 

01:16:05.840 --> 01:16:09.310

night somebody who had some ancient data

01:17:20.320 --> 01:17:20.330
night somebody who had some ancient data
 

01:17:20.330 --> 01:17:23.080
night somebody who had some ancient data
from the 60s from a government site that

01:17:23.080 --> 01:17:23.090
from the 60s from a government site that

in binary code so my question is in

01:17:30.040 --> 01:17:30.050
in binary code so my question is in
 

01:17:30.050 --> 01:17:32.200
in binary code so my question is in
terms of this long-term sustainability

01:17:32.200 --> 01:17:32.210
terms of this long-term sustainability
 

01:17:32.210 --> 01:17:34.120
terms of this long-term sustainability
we have all this wonderful stuff that we

01:17:34.120 --> 01:17:34.130
we have all this wonderful stuff that we
 

01:17:34.130 --> 01:17:36.610
we have all this wonderful stuff that we
put in repositories but things change

01:17:36.610 --> 01:17:36.620
put in repositories but things change
 

01:17:36.620 --> 01:17:38.860

very rapidly something that's current

01:17:38.860 --> 01:17:38.870
very rapidly something that's current
 

01:17:38.870 --> 01:17:40.540
very rapidly something that's current
today I mean is there any guarantee that

01:17:40.540 --> 01:17:40.550
today I mean is there any guarantee that
 

01:17:40.550 --> 01:17:42.669
today I mean is there any guarantee that
an excel file i put in today you'd be

01:17:42.669 --> 01:17:42.679
an excel file i put in today you'd be
 

01:17:42.679 --> 01:17:44.260
an excel file i put in today you'd be
able to read five years later

01:17:44.260 --> 01:17:44.270
able to read five years later
 

01:17:44.270 --> 01:17:47.500
able to read five years later
and who would do all the continual

01:17:47.500 --> 01:17:47.510
and who would do all the continual
 

01:17:47.510 --> 01:17:49.780
and who would do all the continual
upgrading to new versions that's a big

01:17:49.780 --> 01:17:49.790
upgrading to new versions that's a big
 

01:17:49.790 --> 01:17:52.570
upgrading to new versions that's a big
cost so we're looking at this with

01:17:52.570 --> 01:17:52.580
cost so we're looking at this with
 

01:17:52.580 --> 01:17:55.000
cost so we're looking at this with
regards to one way you can do it is if

01:17:55.000 --> 01:17:55.010
regards to one way you can do it is if
 

01:17:55.010 --> 01:17:58.240

you make if you convert everything to an

01:17:58.240 --> 01:17:58.250
you make if you convert everything to an
 

01:17:58.250 --> 01:18:00.790
you make if you convert everything to an
open data standard format then the idea

01:18:00.790 --> 01:18:00.800
open data standard format then the idea
 

01:18:00.800 --> 01:18:03.190
open data standard format then the idea
is that you could say okay so if you if

01:18:03.190 --> 01:18:03.200
is that you could say okay so if you if
 

01:18:03.200 --> 01:18:05.830
is that you could say okay so if you if
it's an excel file you can convert it on

01:18:05.830 --> 01:18:05.840
it's an excel file you can convert it on
 

01:18:05.840 --> 01:18:06.940
it's an excel file you can convert it on
the fly so you should be able to

01:18:06.940 --> 01:18:06.950
the fly so you should be able to
 

01:18:06.950 --> 01:18:08.800
the fly so you should be able to
download it as a CSV or something like

01:18:08.800 --> 01:18:08.810
download it as a CSV or something like
 

01:18:08.810 --> 01:18:10.420
download it as a CSV or something like
that we haven't got this implemented yet

01:18:10.420 --> 01:18:10.430
that we haven't got this implemented yet
 

01:18:10.430 --> 01:18:11.590
that we haven't got this implemented yet
but it's something we're doing but is

01:18:11.590 --> 01:18:11.600
but it's something we're doing but is
 

01:18:11.600 --> 01:18:13.900
but it's something we're doing but is
because there is such a sheer volume of

01:18:13.900 --> 01:18:13.910
because there is such a sheer volume of
 

01:18:13.910 --> 01:18:15.850
because there is such a sheer volume of
files we can't we might not be able to

01:18:15.850 --> 01:18:15.860
files we can't we might not be able to
 

01:18:15.860 --> 01:18:17.920
files we can't we might not be able to
save things going backwards but you know

01:18:17.920 --> 01:18:17.930
save things going backwards but you know
 

01:18:17.930 --> 01:18:20.110
save things going backwards but you know
this is another education thing people

01:18:20.110 --> 01:18:20.120
this is another education thing people
 

01:18:20.120 --> 01:18:22.330
this is another education thing people
should be educated to put the files in a

01:18:22.330 --> 01:18:22.340
should be educated to put the files in a
 

01:18:22.340 --> 01:18:24.760
should be educated to put the files in a
non proprietary format maybe which if

01:18:24.760 --> 01:18:24.770
non proprietary format maybe which if
 

01:18:24.770 --> 01:18:27.610
non proprietary format maybe which if
you use SPSS maybe and I'll going to but

01:18:27.610 --> 01:18:27.620
you use SPSS maybe and I'll going to but
 

01:18:27.620 --> 01:18:30.670
you use SPSS maybe and I'll going to but
yeah okay and I'm afraid our time is up

01:18:30.670 --> 01:18:30.680
yeah okay and I'm afraid our time is up
 

01:18:30.680 --> 01:18:33.910
yeah okay and I'm afraid our time is up
and and I want to give a run of applause

and and I want to give a run of applause
 

01:18:33.920 --> 01:18:37.540
and and I want to give a run of applause
for a great panel and thank you
