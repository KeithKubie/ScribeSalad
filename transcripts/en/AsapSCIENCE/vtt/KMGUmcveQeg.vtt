00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:03.900
We're all told to eat healthy, and be aware of our calorie intake through the day.

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:07.340
But have you ever stopped to see what does calories look like?

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:10.520
For example, this is 200 calories worth of apple

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:15.000
On the other hand, if we take 200 calories worth of cheese, it doesn't look quite the same in terms of volume

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:20.160
throw 200 calories of wine into the mix for a nice wine and cheese

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:22.940
And you have three very different looking versions of 200 calories

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:29.200
Now compare that wine to beer or rum, and you have three very different party nights for your stomach

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:31.180
Or how about the eggs you had for breakfast

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:36.200
Compare that to 200 calories of sweet cereal you had the other day, or even some oatmeal

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:37.860
And they're bound to seem a bit different

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:42.440
But if you had gotten a sausage and egg breakfast sandwich, You'd be looking at even less

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:46.700
Broccoli? You may be surprised by the amount you can eat before you hit 200 calories

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:50.740
Not to mention this stuff is packed with nutrients and a great source of fiber

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:54.000
A slice of pizza? Less than a slice if it has pepperoni on it

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:58.940
And what about the classic Big Mac? Try a 200 calorie 'Small Mac'

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:04.120
And since calories are simply units of energy, with the calories of 217 Big Macs

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:05.980
You can drive your car 35 Kilometres

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.560
So, wait. What is a calorie?

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:13.940
Specifically, a calorie is the amount of energy, or heat it takes to raise the temperature of 1 gram of water

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:15.520
By one degree celsius

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:18.940
We need energy to survive, and we get it from food

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:24.600
Carbohydrates, Protein and fats are the building blocks of our food, and each contribute a different amount of energy to our bodies

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:29.520
The average person needs somewhere between 2000 to 2700 calories a day

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:32.620
Depending on factors like height, weight, gender and age

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:36.580
And some foods like peanut butter are calorie dense, filling this requirement faster

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:41.880
Or that muffin you ate as a snack, chances are its calorie content is higher than you thought

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:45.760
And those irresistible Doritos? Don't lie, you ate the whole bag

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:49.720
Unlike Celery, which has very few calories, giving you lots to munch on

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:50.860
Or carrots

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:52.440
Not so much Hershey's Kisses

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:56.200
And if you're eating salad to limit calories, watch out for creamy dressing

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:58.340
Particularly, french dressing

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:01.120
On its own, black coffee is quite low on calories

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:03.340
You can have a lot before you hit 200 calories

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:07.200
But once you add one cream and one sugar, those calories quickly add up

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:10.600
Turn it into a specialty drink, like an Iced Peppermint White Mocha

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:12.680
And you might be shocked at the amount left

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:14.940
But, just because something has less calories

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:17.780
Doesn't necessarily mean it's healthier or better for you

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:22.720
Take for example this 200 calories of coke vs. 200 calories of whole milk

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:25.760
While it's true that the coke contains fewer calories per litter

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:29.300
You can't forget that milk contains many nutrients and healthy fats

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:31.380
Or like brown bread vs. white bread

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:37.660
Yes, whole wheat bread often contains more calories per slice,  but it also contains more nutrients and fiber

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:40.640
So, counting calories isn't the be all and end all

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:44.060
But thinking about what goes into your body is bound to make a difference

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:47.360
At the end of the day, eat a healthy and balanced diet

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:53.460
