DEREK SLATER: I think
we'll get started.

00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:04.620
Thanks, everybody, for coming.

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:07.170
My name's Derek Slater, and
I'm a Policy Manager on

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:09.420
Google's Public Policy team.

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:13.890
We're having this panel because
we get asked often,

00:00:13.890 --> 00:00:15.680
what should developers be
thinking about in terms of

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:18.080
public policy and the legal
environment around them?

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:21.160
Rather than having us just talk
to you about what Google

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:23.160
thinks about, we wanted to
introduce you to a few other

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:26.360
people who are both working in
the space advocating on behalf

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:30.240
of developers and startups, as
well as helping developers and

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:31.990
startups engage with government
to improve

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:33.380
government and civic services.

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:35.390
So with that, I'm going to turn
it over to the leader of

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:38.810
your panel, Mike McGeary, who is
the Co-founder and Director

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:42.160
of Engine Advocacy, a group that
advocates on behalf of

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:43.690
startups in Washington.

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:44.390
Mike.

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:45.510
MIKE MCGEARY: Thanks, Derek.

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:46.430
Hi, everybody.

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:47.695
Thanks for coming out.

00:00:47.695 --> 00:00:50.930
I will make you one promise as
we start this whole thing.

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:53.720
I know that I am keeping you
from the party, so I will be

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:55.350
prompt and we will make
this worth your time.

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:58.070
So with that, I'm
Mike McGeary.

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:00.010
I'm the Co-founder, Chief
Political Strategist for an

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:01.770
organization called
Engine Advocacy.

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:04.420
We're actually based here in San
Francisco, and what we do,

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:06.990
as Derek said, is connect the
startup community in the

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:08.940
United States to government
at the federal,

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:10.140
state, and local level.

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:13.970
And work to build more efficient
grassroots tools, so

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:16.740
that you, as a developer, an
engineer, or as a founding

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:20.180
entrepreneur of a company that's
growing can have more

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:22.920
of a stake and a voice
in a debate.

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:24.700
I want to make this a little
bit interactive, since it's

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:25.530
the end of the day.

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.890
So if you'll indulge me.

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:31.850
Tell me, how many people out
there have ever taken some

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:34.050
sort of political action
other than voting?

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:36.880
Everything from holding a sign,
to writing a letter to

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:38.570
your congressman, to going to
a city council meeting?

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:40.140
OK, that's a surprising
amount of you.

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:41.880
And that's very good.

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:44.400
For those of you here from
the US, how many of you

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:46.894
did that for SOPA?

00:01:46.894 --> 00:01:47.850
OK.

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:48.260
That's good.

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:49.200
That's a lot of you.

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.590
I'm excited.

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:53.600
One of the reasons I ask that,
and why I think it's really

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:57.100
good to gauge that is for those
that remember what it

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:59.250
was like to go through this SOPA
debate here in the US, it

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:03.830
was really the beginning of,
I think, the next stage in

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:07.900
engaging people like you who
design and build products

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:10.130
every day in the political
process.

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:16.100
Because as your companies have
grown, and have taken root in

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:19.610
places beyond San Francisco,
and beyond New York, and in

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:22.520
cities all across the country,
it's become more important for

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:25.450
members of Congress, for people
at the White House, for

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:28.090
your mayor, for the governor,
for people in the legislature,

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:30.750
in the regulatory environment,
whatever it is, to hear your

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:31.430
perspective.

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:35.540
Because you have a distinct and
important economic impact

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:37.640
on what happens to the
wider economy.

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:38.990
That's a lot of what
we do with Engine.

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:41.200
We're going to talk a little
bit more about economic

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:44.730
impacts, and then about specific
issues and areas that

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:47.670
a lot of this panel that are
all much more learned and

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:48.330
smart than me.

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:50.310
So I'm going to let them
talk in a minute.

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:52.660
What we're all working on and
how you can get involved in

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:54.000
that and help shape
that debate.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.900
But from an overarching
perspective, SOPA really

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:59.580
changed a lot of
things for us.

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:03.320
It was the first time a lot of
people all across the internet

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:04.630
stood up and said,
wait a minute.

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:07.820
This has a material impact
on me and my business.

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:10.430
And that's why this
is important.

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:13.920
The internet, as I like to say
a lot, especially with my

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:17.180
friends from Google, the
internet is the greatest and

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:19.880
most positive force for the
democratization of ideas in

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:21.180
the history of the world.

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:24.770
And we need to protect a free
and open internet, not least

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:26.610
because we need to be able
to exchange those ideas.

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:28.770
But because so many of you
are building products and

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:30.720
applications and businesses and

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:31.680
companies on that internet.

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:33.590
A lot of them right here
in the United States.

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:36.510
And those have an impact on your
community, on am economic

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:38.470
level, on a social level.

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:40.400
Going even deeper than that into
civic innovation, which

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:42.290
you're going to hear
about in a second.

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:45.210
And I think that it's important
to inject your voice

00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:47.530
in a debate when--

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:49.640
if you have a two-person company
and you're working out

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:52.790
of that proverbial garage, I
promise that not one of you

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:53.860
would tell me your
third hire was a

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:55.370
government relations counsel.

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:57.140
It's probably another
developer.

00:03:57.140 --> 00:03:58.700
And that's what you're
supposed to do.

00:03:58.700 --> 00:03:59.940
So we're going to try
to make this easier.

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:01.730
We're going to give you some
tools to get more involved,

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:03.640
more deeply, talk about some
of the issues that are

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:04.740
happening here in the US.

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:08.000
For those of you who are here
from overseas, we'll talk

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:12.270
about global issues as well, and
want to hear from you and

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:13.010
some things like that.

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:14.660
There are some groups that are
forming all around the world

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:17.750
to do this that we're friendly
with, that we're working with.

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:20.040
So we'd love to hear and
talk more about that.

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:21.380
Want to make it an interactive
session.

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:22.530
We'll all going to do a
little introduction.

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:24.120
I'm going to ask some questions
to the panel.

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:25.870
And then we'll do a little
Q&amp;A. There are two

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:29.340
microphones, and they've asked
me to have you stand up and

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:33.670
form an orderly queue so that we
can get those questions on

00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:36.860
audio and video for perpetuity
to be shared forever.

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:38.950
But anyway, so thanks
all for being here.

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:40.040
That's my quick introduction.

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:42.310
I want to kind of go down the
panel and introduce you to who

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:42.920
we've got here.

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:47.145
First, to my left, we're really
privileged to have Jen

00:04:47.145 --> 00:04:50.830
Pahlka with us who leads
Code for America.

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:54.320
My favorite part of what she
does is that it really allows

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:57.370
you guys, developers, building
companies, building

00:04:57.370 --> 00:04:59.140
organizations--

00:04:59.140 --> 00:05:02.380
with the nine seconds of free
time you have every week, you

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:05.090
can jump in and help make
your city smarter.

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:07.340
Or you can take some time and
really dive in and do that.

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:08.560
She's going to talk
more about that.

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:11.590
But talking a little bit about
civic innovation and what that

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:16.530
can mean and how that can be an
important step in building

00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:17.210
stronger communities.

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:19.020
But Jen, tell us about Code for
America and what you're

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:19.660
working on.

00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:21.340
JEN PAHLKA: It's a bad
idea to put me first.

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:21.760
MIKE MCGEARY: I know.

00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:22.980
JEN PAHLKA: You want
to do that?

00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:23.260
OK.

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:24.635
MIKE MCGEARY: Do you not
want me to do that?

00:05:24.635 --> 00:05:27.240
JEN PAHLKA: Well, I always like
to pick it up after the--

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:27.880
MIKE MCGEARY: OK.

00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:28.080
JEN PAHLKA: But I can do that.

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:28.980
Do you want me to do that?

00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:29.460
MIKE MCGEARY: Sure.

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:30.410
JEN PAHLKA: OK.

00:05:30.410 --> 00:05:31.280
It is on.

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:31.930
OK.

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:33.600
Thank you for that very
sweet introduction.

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:35.440
So I think you're going--

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:37.850
the reason I didn't want to go
first isn't that I'm shy.

00:05:37.850 --> 00:05:42.720
Though, I'm less shy every
day these days.

00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:46.210
I think we do sort of pick up
where others leave off, in the

00:05:46.210 --> 00:05:50.400
sense that the first interface
that you are offered as a

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:52.610
citizen is a political
interface.

00:05:52.610 --> 00:05:54.950
And the first thing you're
asked to do is vote.

00:05:54.950 --> 00:05:55.600
You need to vote.

00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:58.100
And then after you sort of vote,
and then things don't

00:05:58.100 --> 00:06:00.820
necessarily turn out exactly
the way you'd like them to,

00:06:00.820 --> 00:06:02.940
then you find other
ways to advocate.

00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:05.110
And I think these guys are all
going to talk about some very

00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:08.420
important ways that you need
to advocate beyond voting.

00:06:08.420 --> 00:06:12.320
Where we come in is actually
beyond that.

00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:15.530
So we're talking here
about policy.

00:06:15.530 --> 00:06:18.530
And there are a lot of ways
in which policies

00:06:18.530 --> 00:06:20.160
get written and passed.

00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:22.370
And they may be even the
ones that you wanted.

00:06:22.370 --> 00:06:25.790
And then somehow, it goes
wrong yet again.

00:06:25.790 --> 00:06:26.790
Anyone hear--

00:06:26.790 --> 00:06:28.490
Terry Gross-- actually, it
wasn't Terry Gross, but it was

00:06:28.490 --> 00:06:33.736
Fresh Air last week, the guest
host talking about Dodd-Frank.

00:06:33.736 --> 00:06:35.380
Frank-Dodd?

00:06:35.380 --> 00:06:39.060
So we passed this piece of
legislation that is supposed

00:06:39.060 --> 00:06:43.950
to address some of the ills from
the financial meltdown.

00:06:43.950 --> 00:06:47.340
And a lot of people worked
really, really hard to get

00:06:47.340 --> 00:06:48.300
this thing passed.

00:06:48.300 --> 00:06:50.710
And I think there were a lot of
things right about it, some

00:06:50.710 --> 00:06:52.400
things wrong about it.

00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:54.770
But basically, it was sort
of doing the right thing.

00:06:54.770 --> 00:06:58.310
And then, in the couple of years
since it's been passed,

00:06:58.310 --> 00:07:00.750
it has now gone from the
political realm into the

00:07:00.750 --> 00:07:05.320
bureaucratic realm, to be
implemented in government.

00:07:05.320 --> 00:07:08.010
Those people that we call
bureaucrats, and we often use

00:07:08.010 --> 00:07:10.120
that word with a bit
of contempt.

00:07:10.120 --> 00:07:12.910
And I don't think that
is serving us well.

00:07:12.910 --> 00:07:15.190
They have the very
difficult job of

00:07:15.190 --> 00:07:16.540
actually making that real.

00:07:16.540 --> 00:07:20.130
And in the years since it
was passed, most of the

00:07:20.130 --> 00:07:23.020
protections that were in that
bill have been essentially

00:07:23.020 --> 00:07:25.850
unwound and, as I
said, defanged.

00:07:25.850 --> 00:07:29.370
So there is this critical gap,
I think, between the

00:07:29.370 --> 00:07:32.630
intentions of policies and
the outcomes of policies.

00:07:32.630 --> 00:07:35.160
The reason I'm starting with
that is I'll give you a firm

00:07:35.160 --> 00:07:38.130
example from Code for
America's work.

00:07:38.130 --> 00:07:43.580
We came into the city of
Philadelphia last year and we

00:07:43.580 --> 00:07:45.870
had a team working
with the planners

00:07:45.870 --> 00:07:48.560
there on the 2035 Plan.

00:07:48.560 --> 00:07:52.000
This is the strategic plan that
will guide development

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:55.230
within Philadelphia for
several years to come.

00:07:55.230 --> 00:07:56.200
And they need input.

00:07:56.200 --> 00:07:58.580
They have a policy that says
they're supposed to get input

00:07:58.580 --> 00:08:00.040
from a lot of different
citizens

00:08:00.040 --> 00:08:01.720
about particular things.

00:08:01.720 --> 00:08:03.850
Things like food deserts,
whether rail

00:08:03.850 --> 00:08:05.810
lines should be extended.

00:08:05.810 --> 00:08:08.770
But the policy allows
people to come in

00:08:08.770 --> 00:08:09.900
and give that feedback.

00:08:09.900 --> 00:08:11.670
Well, they have to
come in person at

00:08:11.670 --> 00:08:13.610
6:30 on Thursday nights.

00:08:13.610 --> 00:08:16.220
So the people that come and give
feedback to that plan are

00:08:16.220 --> 00:08:18.660
not the people that they
need answers from.

00:08:18.660 --> 00:08:20.690
They're not the people who
live in food deserts.

00:08:20.690 --> 00:08:23.440
They're not the people taking
those rail lines.

00:08:23.440 --> 00:08:24.850
And so the Code for
America fellows--

00:08:24.850 --> 00:08:26.100
these are people who
take a year off.

00:08:26.100 --> 00:08:29.030
In fact, one of them was a
Googler who took a year off

00:08:29.030 --> 00:08:30.870
and came to work with
Code for America.

00:08:30.870 --> 00:08:33.419
They built a very simple text
messaging platform.

00:08:33.419 --> 00:08:36.370
They put posters up
around the city in

00:08:36.370 --> 00:08:37.610
very particular places.

00:08:37.610 --> 00:08:40.380
So if they were in a food desert
it said, please tell us

00:08:40.380 --> 00:08:41.480
where you shop for groceries.

00:08:41.480 --> 00:08:44.169
Text your answer to
this phone number.

00:08:44.169 --> 00:08:47.120
A lot of people don't,
unfortunately, have internet

00:08:47.120 --> 00:08:49.230
access in their homes
in Philadelphia.

00:08:49.230 --> 00:08:51.330
And they don't even have
smartphones, but they do have

00:08:51.330 --> 00:08:53.250
phones that can do SMS.

00:08:53.250 --> 00:08:56.180
At the end of these rail lines
they said, would you take this

00:08:56.180 --> 00:08:57.570
rail line if it were extended?

00:08:57.570 --> 00:09:00.120
You'd text the answer in
and it would text you

00:09:00.120 --> 00:09:00.990
back another answer.

00:09:00.990 --> 00:09:02.550
Well, what if you had
to switch to a

00:09:02.550 --> 00:09:03.630
different bus or something?

00:09:03.630 --> 00:09:04.995
So you could get all
this feedback.

00:09:07.830 --> 00:09:10.090
That's making what you're
doing actually meet the

00:09:10.090 --> 00:09:12.310
intentions of the policy.

00:09:12.310 --> 00:09:16.450
And I mean, there's a lot more
to say about Code for America,

00:09:16.450 --> 00:09:19.520
and I think about different
ways that

00:09:19.520 --> 00:09:20.430
we can affect policy.

00:09:20.430 --> 00:09:23.170
But I thought I'd just start
with that as an example of how

00:09:23.170 --> 00:09:26.330
it's really important not just
to think about politics and

00:09:26.330 --> 00:09:29.080
voting as your interface
to government.

00:09:29.080 --> 00:09:31.400
We're really talking about
getting under the hood.

00:09:31.400 --> 00:09:33.520
The bureaucracy is the operating
system of our

00:09:33.520 --> 00:09:33.860
government.

00:09:33.860 --> 00:09:35.370
We need to get down
there, too.

00:09:35.370 --> 00:09:36.600
DEREK SLATER: That's great.

00:09:36.600 --> 00:09:38.120
Bureaucracy is an operating
system.

00:09:38.120 --> 00:09:39.120
There's a concept.

00:09:39.120 --> 00:09:40.330
But no, it's absolutely true.

00:09:40.330 --> 00:09:43.150
And the work that you guys have
done-- that's a great

00:09:43.150 --> 00:09:45.400
slice of life-- has
been great.

00:09:45.400 --> 00:09:46.570
We're going to come back.

00:09:46.570 --> 00:09:49.190
I've got a couple of good
questions there, but I want to

00:09:49.190 --> 00:09:53.670
introduce next Kevin Callahan,
who is one of you, in ways

00:09:53.670 --> 00:09:55.770
that the three of us are not.

00:09:55.770 --> 00:09:59.950
I often say that I should be
barred from ever touching code

00:09:59.950 --> 00:10:02.820
on anything that we do publicly
or privately,

00:10:02.820 --> 00:10:05.920
frankly, in websites that
we build in my office.

00:10:05.920 --> 00:10:09.220
But Kevin is the Technical
Co-founder of a business

00:10:09.220 --> 00:10:10.280
called MapMyFitness.

00:10:10.280 --> 00:10:11.850
And he's down in
Austin, Texas.

00:10:11.850 --> 00:10:13.690
So why is he here on
a policy panel?

00:10:13.690 --> 00:10:17.320
And Kevin, talk a little bit
about your experience and why

00:10:17.320 --> 00:10:21.500
it matters to you as an
entrepreneur owning a growing

00:10:21.500 --> 00:10:23.200
business, continuing
to grow in Austin.

00:10:23.200 --> 00:10:25.030
So not in Silicon Valley,
not in New York.

00:10:25.030 --> 00:10:27.330
Why it's important do you think
for someone like you to

00:10:27.330 --> 00:10:29.010
be involved in policy?

00:10:29.010 --> 00:10:30.080
KEVIN CALLAHAN: Thank
you, Mike.

00:10:30.080 --> 00:10:30.880
So my name's Kevin.

00:10:30.880 --> 00:10:35.770
I started my first website in
2005 because there was a joke

00:10:35.770 --> 00:10:38.010
that I was too cheap
to buy a GPS watch.

00:10:38.010 --> 00:10:41.880
And since then, we've grown to
about 100 people, 50 of which

00:10:41.880 --> 00:10:42.910
are in Austin, Texas.

00:10:42.910 --> 00:10:45.010
About 30 in Denver.

00:10:45.010 --> 00:10:47.110
About 20 across the country.

00:10:47.110 --> 00:10:51.600
And I had always thought that
I was a small businessperson

00:10:51.600 --> 00:10:54.180
without a real voice in terms
of some of the policy that

00:10:54.180 --> 00:10:55.580
affects me.

00:10:55.580 --> 00:10:58.770
And so the reason I'm here is,
is I met Mike about a year

00:10:58.770 --> 00:11:01.820
ago, and I learned about this
great organization called

00:11:01.820 --> 00:11:04.020
Engine Advocacy.

00:11:04.020 --> 00:11:06.590
And there were three reasons
that this organization really

00:11:06.590 --> 00:11:09.810
sort of compelled me, A, to be a
member, but B, to sort of be

00:11:09.810 --> 00:11:12.380
up here on stage talking
to you about my

00:11:12.380 --> 00:11:14.690
experiences with Engine.

00:11:14.690 --> 00:11:16.540
First was need.

00:11:16.540 --> 00:11:19.835
As a technical co-founder, as
someone who was trying to grow

00:11:19.835 --> 00:11:21.890
a business, we would eventually

00:11:21.890 --> 00:11:23.690
run into some hurdles.

00:11:23.690 --> 00:11:26.070
We kind of high-fived each other
when we got our first

00:11:26.070 --> 00:11:28.880
lawsuit and we were named
next to Facebook

00:11:28.880 --> 00:11:30.820
and Google and MapQuest.

00:11:30.820 --> 00:11:33.540
Pretty soon, those high-fives
turned to tears as the

00:11:33.540 --> 00:11:35.230
lawsuits keep coming.

00:11:35.230 --> 00:11:37.080
But it was almost a
rite of passage.

00:11:37.080 --> 00:11:41.390
You sort of get famous
enough to get sued.

00:11:41.390 --> 00:11:44.250
And now it's getting involved
in pushing through

00:11:44.250 --> 00:11:46.600
legislation, like the America
Invents Act, which radically

00:11:46.600 --> 00:11:48.120
changed the system.

00:11:48.120 --> 00:11:50.510
There's still a lot of work to
be done with the SHIELD Act,

00:11:50.510 --> 00:11:55.130
which really puts the onus on
the loser of a lawsuit paying

00:11:55.130 --> 00:11:56.180
your legal fees.

00:11:56.180 --> 00:11:57.770
We've sort of fixed some of
these problems and it's

00:11:57.770 --> 00:12:00.930
through Engine that I really
learned how to interact and

00:12:00.930 --> 00:12:02.770
get my voice heard more.

00:12:02.770 --> 00:12:04.950
The second was confidence.

00:12:04.950 --> 00:12:07.600
I don't think prior to meeting
Mike and hearing his stories

00:12:07.600 --> 00:12:09.890
about how he's worked with other
startup founders, other

00:12:09.890 --> 00:12:13.030
technology companies my size,
that I would be able to sit

00:12:13.030 --> 00:12:17.300
down at a table at dinner with
Senator Cornyn, who's one of

00:12:17.300 --> 00:12:20.280
our senators in Texas, with
his legislative director.

00:12:20.280 --> 00:12:23.610
Because they wanted to hear
about my opinions about

00:12:23.610 --> 00:12:27.580
legislation, which was a really
amazing experience.

00:12:27.580 --> 00:12:30.300
Mike was instrumental, or
Engine Advocacy was

00:12:30.300 --> 00:12:35.200
instrumental in bringing Senator
Moran to the table at

00:12:35.200 --> 00:12:39.230
South by, and sitting next to
him and having him talk about

00:12:39.230 --> 00:12:43.530
his Startup Act 3.0, which
really tries to address some

00:12:43.530 --> 00:12:46.660
of the broken things about our
immigration system and our

00:12:46.660 --> 00:12:47.780
visa system.

00:12:47.780 --> 00:12:49.920
And then the third
is education.

00:12:49.920 --> 00:12:52.710
Like all of you, we get
inundated with news.

00:12:52.710 --> 00:12:55.300
And how many different websites
can you go to kind of

00:12:55.300 --> 00:12:57.980
really figure out the issues and
figure out what matters?

00:12:57.980 --> 00:13:01.760
And Engine Advocacy really boils
down the issues to what

00:13:01.760 --> 00:13:06.670
really matter to us as
developers, us as business

00:13:06.670 --> 00:13:08.570
leaders, us as entrepreneurs.

00:13:08.570 --> 00:13:14.720
And so it's really those three
issues that I'm gladly able to

00:13:14.720 --> 00:13:17.390
come and sit up here in front of
you guys and just tell you

00:13:17.390 --> 00:13:20.320
how much I love what Mike
and Engine is doing.

00:13:20.320 --> 00:13:21.390
MIKE MCGEARY: He's not a
plant, I promise you.

00:13:21.390 --> 00:13:23.202
Though, as I often say when
we're on panels together, I'm

00:13:23.202 --> 00:13:25.690
just going to give you all
the money in my pocket.

00:13:25.690 --> 00:13:27.350
So thanks, Kevin.

00:13:27.350 --> 00:13:29.740
You touched on a couple issues
there that I think lead us

00:13:29.740 --> 00:13:34.240
into you, Jeremy, in that
patent is something with

00:13:34.240 --> 00:13:36.330
America Invents, and now SHIELD
and some other things

00:13:36.330 --> 00:13:39.020
that I think a lot of people in
this room have either run

00:13:39.020 --> 00:13:40.200
afoul of a patent troll.

00:13:40.200 --> 00:13:43.220
Or if you haven't yet, as Kevin
says, maybe you haven't

00:13:43.220 --> 00:13:45.580
graduated to the big boy level
of getting sued yet.

00:13:45.580 --> 00:13:47.680
So hey, good luck.

00:13:47.680 --> 00:13:49.230
But we're trying to
fix that, too.

00:13:49.230 --> 00:13:51.520
And we're going to need a lot
of developer voices on that.

00:13:51.520 --> 00:13:53.310
The other one is immigration.

00:13:53.310 --> 00:13:55.735
And there's a woman named Lesa
Mitchell, who works for the

00:13:55.735 --> 00:13:59.350
Kauffman Foundation,
who is awesome.

00:13:59.350 --> 00:14:02.980
And also says, if you asked an
entrepreneur what their top

00:14:02.980 --> 00:14:06.280
five policy area issues are--
and I'm relatively certain for

00:14:06.280 --> 00:14:08.370
those of you from the US in this
room, you probably would

00:14:08.370 --> 00:14:09.300
agree with this.

00:14:09.300 --> 00:14:11.560
If you asked for the top five
answers on the board, the

00:14:11.560 --> 00:14:13.580
first four would be immigration
and the fifth one

00:14:13.580 --> 00:14:14.430
would probably be patent.

00:14:14.430 --> 00:14:16.750
But it's those first four
is immigration.

00:14:16.750 --> 00:14:18.500
All the way down to my left is
someone who's actually doing

00:14:18.500 --> 00:14:21.075
something about it.

00:14:21.075 --> 00:14:26.220
Is more than talk is action, and
comes from a place where

00:14:26.220 --> 00:14:27.520
action means a lot
more than words.

00:14:27.520 --> 00:14:29.030
And that's New York City.

00:14:29.030 --> 00:14:32.390
Jeremy Robbins is a policy
advisor to Mayor Michael

00:14:32.390 --> 00:14:34.690
Bloomberg of New York and runs
the partnership for A New

00:14:34.690 --> 00:14:36.740
American Economy.

00:14:36.740 --> 00:14:37.810
I'm not going to read
your whole bio.

00:14:37.810 --> 00:14:38.620
I'll let you do that.

00:14:38.620 --> 00:14:42.340
But he's also running something
called the March for

00:14:42.340 --> 00:14:45.150
Innovation, which is a great way
to get involved on what's

00:14:45.150 --> 00:14:47.010
happening with the immigration
debate here in the United

00:14:47.010 --> 00:14:49.820
States and try to get more
entrepreneurial people that

00:14:49.820 --> 00:14:52.080
are already here to be able to
stay and start business and

00:14:52.080 --> 00:14:53.710
work for technology companies.

00:14:53.710 --> 00:14:55.910
So Jeremy, tell us a little bit
about what you're doing in

00:14:55.910 --> 00:14:57.710
March and things like that.

00:14:57.710 --> 00:14:58.080
JEREMY ROBBINS: Thanks.

00:14:58.080 --> 00:14:58.610
Thank you, Mike.

00:14:58.610 --> 00:14:59.560
I'd be delighted to.

00:14:59.560 --> 00:15:02.640
And so let me start where Mike
started, which is by asking a

00:15:02.640 --> 00:15:04.190
couple questions.

00:15:04.190 --> 00:15:05.930
And I think the first one is,
how many of you in this

00:15:05.930 --> 00:15:08.280
audience, by a show of
hands, were born out

00:15:08.280 --> 00:15:10.870
of the United States?

00:15:10.870 --> 00:15:11.760
Keep your hands up.

00:15:11.760 --> 00:15:13.760
How many of you have at least
one parent who was born

00:15:13.760 --> 00:15:16.460
outside of the United States?

00:15:16.460 --> 00:15:19.040
And now, how many of you work
at a company where at least

00:15:19.040 --> 00:15:22.252
one key employee was born
outside the United States?

00:15:22.252 --> 00:15:24.080
It's basically all of you.

00:15:24.080 --> 00:15:27.460
And there are two good
reasons to ask that.

00:15:27.460 --> 00:15:31.390
First is because it makes it
really, really obvious about

00:15:31.390 --> 00:15:33.720
the economic importance
of immigration.

00:15:33.720 --> 00:15:37.500
You are the cutting-edge
developers in the most

00:15:37.500 --> 00:15:40.300
important innovation industry,
or one of the most important

00:15:40.300 --> 00:15:42.690
innovation industries
in our economy.

00:15:42.690 --> 00:15:45.595
And every single one of you
depends on immigrants or are

00:15:45.595 --> 00:15:47.270
an immigrant yourself.

00:15:47.270 --> 00:15:50.720
And if you look at what those
statistics are nationally, you

00:15:50.720 --> 00:15:54.360
get 40% of our Fortune 500
companies were founded by an

00:15:54.360 --> 00:15:56.055
immigrant or a child
of an immigrant.

00:15:56.055 --> 00:15:58.360
If you look at innovation,
what's coming out of our top

00:15:58.360 --> 00:16:00.840
universities, more than 3 out
of every 4 patents from our

00:16:00.840 --> 00:16:04.530
top 10 universities have at
least one immigrant inventor

00:16:04.530 --> 00:16:05.145
on the patent.

00:16:05.145 --> 00:16:07.220
I mean, the numbers are
staggering when you think

00:16:07.220 --> 00:16:08.300
about immigration.

00:16:08.300 --> 00:16:11.290
But the second reason I asked
you to put up your hands is

00:16:11.290 --> 00:16:13.700
because it means that almost all
of you have had first-hand

00:16:13.700 --> 00:16:16.350
experience with our immigration
system, which I

00:16:16.350 --> 00:16:19.160
assume also means you realize
how broken it is.

00:16:19.160 --> 00:16:21.830
That if you want to come to
America, you want to start a

00:16:21.830 --> 00:16:24.200
company and you want to hire
American workers, there's no

00:16:24.200 --> 00:16:25.920
visa for you.

00:16:25.920 --> 00:16:27.610
But if you want to come
here on a temporary

00:16:27.610 --> 00:16:29.340
high-skilled visa--

00:16:29.340 --> 00:16:32.120
well, it turns you're out of
luck because the year's supply

00:16:32.120 --> 00:16:33.630
of high-skilled visas
was exhausted in

00:16:33.630 --> 00:16:35.590
five days this year.

00:16:35.590 --> 00:16:39.440
You're going to have to
wait till next April.

00:16:39.440 --> 00:16:42.050
Immigration reform is something
that has been so

00:16:42.050 --> 00:16:45.750
fundamentally important for our
economy for decades, but

00:16:45.750 --> 00:16:47.530
we haven't gotten.

00:16:47.530 --> 00:16:50.960
And the reality is that politics
moves in moments and

00:16:50.960 --> 00:16:52.320
this is a moment.

00:16:52.320 --> 00:16:54.750
Now, we have an immigration
system that was started, by

00:16:54.750 --> 00:16:57.500
and large, the way it exists
today in 1965 when we were

00:16:57.500 --> 00:16:58.920
watching black and white TVs.

00:16:58.920 --> 00:17:02.530
And it makes absolutely no sense
in a global economy.

00:17:02.530 --> 00:17:04.950
But this is a moment
for change.

00:17:04.950 --> 00:17:07.550
This is a moment where there is
a comprehensive immigration

00:17:07.550 --> 00:17:10.880
bill right now in the Senate,
a bill that has a very

00:17:10.880 --> 00:17:14.760
legitimate chance of passage but
has a very, very difficult

00:17:14.760 --> 00:17:16.869
road to becoming law.

00:17:16.869 --> 00:17:18.869
And I think there's a natural
tendency for people to say,

00:17:18.869 --> 00:17:20.000
well, what can I do?

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:21.490
That I'm just individual.

00:17:21.490 --> 00:17:23.410
I don't know a senator.

00:17:23.410 --> 00:17:24.290
I don't go to DC.

00:17:24.290 --> 00:17:25.710
I don't understand how
politics works.

00:17:25.710 --> 00:17:27.430
I think DC is broken.

00:17:27.430 --> 00:17:30.910
I don't think there's anything
that my voice can do.

00:17:30.910 --> 00:17:32.980
But that couldn't be further
than the truth.

00:17:32.980 --> 00:17:36.770
This bill is not going to pass
unless people stand up.

00:17:36.770 --> 00:17:38.340
And people can stand
up because people

00:17:38.340 --> 00:17:40.130
care what you think.

00:17:40.130 --> 00:17:42.250
You can speak collectively.

00:17:42.250 --> 00:17:44.750
And especially when you talk
about social media and new

00:17:44.750 --> 00:17:47.000
ways of communication,
you have an outsize

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:49.810
voice in this debate.

00:17:49.810 --> 00:17:52.330
So that's why we started the
March for Innovation, which is

00:17:52.330 --> 00:17:55.000
going to be the largest ever
virtual march on DC.

00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:57.660
And we've been very proud to
partner with Engine Advocacy

00:17:57.660 --> 00:18:00.460
since the very beginning.

00:18:00.460 --> 00:18:01.980
This march is going
to kick off next

00:18:01.980 --> 00:18:03.630
Wednesday and Thursday.

00:18:03.630 --> 00:18:07.100
There's going to be a huge
two-day digital storm where

00:18:07.100 --> 00:18:09.620
we're going to get leaders
from politics, from

00:18:09.620 --> 00:18:14.320
technology, from media, from
entertainment, from sports, to

00:18:14.320 --> 00:18:17.010
jump across every social media
platform, from Google

00:18:17.010 --> 00:18:20.580
Hangouts, to Twitter Town
Halls, from Reddit AMAs.

00:18:20.580 --> 00:18:23.380
Creating a storm everywhere
you're going to look, driving

00:18:23.380 --> 00:18:26.240
people to
marchforinnovation.com, where

00:18:26.240 --> 00:18:29.900
they can sign up to with one
click, use Twitter and

00:18:29.900 --> 00:18:33.010
Facebook to call on their
senators for reform.

00:18:33.010 --> 00:18:34.720
And we'll going to have a lot
of star power to lead this,

00:18:34.720 --> 00:18:37.140
but the only way this works
is if we build an army.

00:18:37.140 --> 00:18:39.580
Is if people stand
up individually.

00:18:39.580 --> 00:18:40.730
People tell their friends.

00:18:40.730 --> 00:18:41.680
People tweet about it.

00:18:41.680 --> 00:18:43.520
People get involved.

00:18:43.520 --> 00:18:44.650
And it's going to be
a great success.

00:18:44.650 --> 00:18:46.680
It's going to be a great success
in no small part

00:18:46.680 --> 00:18:50.110
because of Engine Advocacy and
because a lot of other groups

00:18:50.110 --> 00:18:51.850
that have encouraged people
to get involved.

00:18:51.850 --> 00:18:54.690
That have encouraged people to
know that you can actually

00:18:54.690 --> 00:18:56.170
make a difference very easily.

00:18:56.170 --> 00:18:59.720
And now that you all have nice
Chromebooks, you can actually

00:18:59.720 --> 00:19:00.330
do it right now.

00:19:00.330 --> 00:19:02.700
Or you can do it from
your mobile device.

00:19:02.700 --> 00:19:04.540
You can go to
marchforinnovation.com right

00:19:04.540 --> 00:19:06.630
now and sign up.

00:19:06.630 --> 00:19:09.290
And then there are tools to tell
your friends, to queue up

00:19:09.290 --> 00:19:13.110
your call for support, to get
involved, to tell your story,

00:19:13.110 --> 00:19:16.730
and to be active so that next
week when we start this march,

00:19:16.730 --> 00:19:17.680
we can have a huge difference.

00:19:17.680 --> 00:19:19.410
And we will have a huge
difference, but it all starts

00:19:19.410 --> 00:19:20.040
with signing up.

00:19:20.040 --> 00:19:22.800
And so what we need more
of is we need more

00:19:22.800 --> 00:19:23.710
people to get engaged.

00:19:23.710 --> 00:19:26.180
We need more organizations, like
Engine Advocacy, which

00:19:26.180 --> 00:19:32.320
are absolutely on the cutting
edge of both grassroots

00:19:32.320 --> 00:19:34.440
organizing and of
policy thinking.

00:19:34.440 --> 00:19:36.470
And so I thank you, Mike.

00:19:36.470 --> 00:19:38.880
And I thank you, Google, for
having me here today, and for

00:19:38.880 --> 00:19:39.490
this panel.

00:19:39.490 --> 00:19:42.410
Because this is how
change starts.

00:19:42.410 --> 00:19:43.830
So thank you.

00:19:43.830 --> 00:19:45.380
MIKE MCGEARY: This is really
not a program length

00:19:45.380 --> 00:19:46.720
commercial for Engine Advocacy.

00:19:46.720 --> 00:19:47.200
I promise.

00:19:47.200 --> 00:19:47.930
But thank you, Jeremy.

00:19:47.930 --> 00:19:48.370
That's very nice.

00:19:48.370 --> 00:19:50.490
I want to stay with you for a
minute because I want to ask--

00:19:50.490 --> 00:19:54.240
we're sitting here at I/O. These
are the best developers

00:19:54.240 --> 00:19:55.590
and engineers in the world.

00:19:55.590 --> 00:19:57.930
So a virtual march.

00:19:57.930 --> 00:19:58.820
OK.

00:19:58.820 --> 00:20:02.095
What can people who are much
more technically savvy than

00:20:02.095 --> 00:20:06.530
you or I do to be particularly
effective during this and

00:20:06.530 --> 00:20:10.050
moving beyond into the wider
immigration fight through all

00:20:10.050 --> 00:20:11.400
of our platforms on this?

00:20:11.400 --> 00:20:13.690
And how do you think that could
translate into sort of

00:20:13.690 --> 00:20:16.230
sustained movement to get
people involved as well?

00:20:16.230 --> 00:20:17.060
JEREMY ROBBINS: It's
a great question.

00:20:17.060 --> 00:20:19.940
And I think a lot of it, I'm
the wrong person to talk to

00:20:19.940 --> 00:20:21.760
because I think I should be
learning more from you in the

00:20:21.760 --> 00:20:26.120
sense that, if you look at why
SOPA/PIPA was such a big

00:20:26.120 --> 00:20:27.910
success and--

00:20:27.910 --> 00:20:30.620
I know I saw a lot of hands in
this audience that played a

00:20:30.620 --> 00:20:32.300
big role in it.

00:20:32.300 --> 00:20:35.260
It was a success because
people got creative.

00:20:35.260 --> 00:20:36.860
People got active.

00:20:36.860 --> 00:20:38.880
And it wasn't just Wikipedia
shutting down.

00:20:38.880 --> 00:20:41.160
I think too often one of the
problems of SOPA/PIPA is that

00:20:41.160 --> 00:20:42.920
the lesson that seems to be
learned, at least in the

00:20:42.920 --> 00:20:46.670
media, is that Wikipedia shut
down for a day, and therefore,

00:20:46.670 --> 00:20:47.120
the bill stopped.

00:20:47.120 --> 00:20:47.760
That's not what happened.

00:20:47.760 --> 00:20:49.520
What happened is that people,
like Michael McGeary and

00:20:49.520 --> 00:20:52.320
people like you in the
audience went crazy.

00:20:52.320 --> 00:20:53.910
You looked at what your
talents were.

00:20:53.910 --> 00:20:59.160
Whether it was creating a Tumblr
storm, or getting viral

00:20:59.160 --> 00:21:03.290
videos, or whatever you were
doing, it was figure out ways

00:21:03.290 --> 00:21:06.690
to make it easier for people to
engage, to tell their story

00:21:06.690 --> 00:21:08.810
in different ways, and to
get people involved.

00:21:08.810 --> 00:21:11.780
And I think that, when we have
the smartest developers in the

00:21:11.780 --> 00:21:14.420
world, many of them sitting
in this room.

00:21:14.420 --> 00:21:16.480
It's about, what can you do
of your own initiative?

00:21:16.480 --> 00:21:17.850
How can you--

00:21:17.850 --> 00:21:21.090
maybe it's something
as simple as a Vine

00:21:21.090 --> 00:21:22.060
video or animated GIF.

00:21:22.060 --> 00:21:23.380
Maybe it's building
a web tool.

00:21:23.380 --> 00:21:27.130
Maybe it's mocking up a website
or taking the widget

00:21:27.130 --> 00:21:32.120
that you can download at
marchforinnovation.com and

00:21:32.120 --> 00:21:33.716
iterating on that.

00:21:33.716 --> 00:21:36.650
But there are a lot of ways
that we need smart people

00:21:36.650 --> 00:21:38.380
coming up with creative
and smart solutions.

00:21:38.380 --> 00:21:41.630
And I think this is where it
starts, is rooms like this.

00:21:41.630 --> 00:21:43.530
MIKE MCGEARY: I think that's
one of the things that we

00:21:43.530 --> 00:21:46.800
really work to do, is create a
platform where creative people

00:21:46.800 --> 00:21:48.510
can go and do exactly that.

00:21:48.510 --> 00:21:52.010
Because you and I, and the
rest of us, we're not the

00:21:52.010 --> 00:21:53.280
smart ones all the time.

00:21:53.280 --> 00:21:55.700
We're trying to create the
platform and get more people

00:21:55.700 --> 00:21:57.310
involved to do exactly that.

00:21:57.310 --> 00:22:00.710
I want to turn to Kevin
for a minute.

00:22:00.710 --> 00:22:03.010
I want you to talk a little
bit more about your

00:22:03.010 --> 00:22:05.810
experience, having dinner with
John Cornyn's legislative

00:22:05.810 --> 00:22:12.510
director, as a businessperson,
who's a constituent as well.

00:22:12.510 --> 00:22:16.200
And I want to use that as a
frame to talk about some of

00:22:16.200 --> 00:22:18.300
the issues that you see coming
down the horizon that are

00:22:18.300 --> 00:22:22.620
going to be specific to where
you see as a business going

00:22:22.620 --> 00:22:24.810
beyond immigration and
things like that.

00:22:24.810 --> 00:22:28.100
What would they have been
most interested in?

00:22:28.100 --> 00:22:30.960
Take us inside that conversation
a little bit.

00:22:30.960 --> 00:22:35.570
And what was it scary going in
and scary coming out, or was

00:22:35.570 --> 00:22:36.810
it productive?

00:22:36.810 --> 00:22:37.170
KEVIN CALLAHAN: No.

00:22:37.170 --> 00:22:40.460
So it was tremendously
scary going in.

00:22:40.460 --> 00:22:43.490
Here was this gentleman
that flew in from DC.

00:22:43.490 --> 00:22:48.110
We spent the day touring Dell
and AMD and all these large

00:22:48.110 --> 00:22:50.330
Fortune 50 companies,
or Fortune 500

00:22:50.330 --> 00:22:52.490
companies here in Austin.

00:22:52.490 --> 00:22:55.690
But then he just wanted to
unwind with a beer, talking to

00:22:55.690 --> 00:22:58.720
someone who just sort of is
trying to grow a company.

00:22:58.720 --> 00:23:01.840
And to understand what issues
were important to me.

00:23:01.840 --> 00:23:05.500
And questions he was asking
was, A, Startup Act.

00:23:05.500 --> 00:23:08.640
How does that really
sort of impact kind

00:23:08.640 --> 00:23:10.980
of my role, my job?

00:23:10.980 --> 00:23:14.320
And for me what it is,
is I live in Austin.

00:23:14.320 --> 00:23:15.790
I have a growing company.

00:23:15.790 --> 00:23:18.260
We doubled our size over
the past year.

00:23:18.260 --> 00:23:20.780
I can't hire engineers.

00:23:20.780 --> 00:23:22.680
If any of you want to move to
Austin, Texas, we're actually

00:23:22.680 --> 00:23:24.905
hiring Python engineers.

00:23:24.905 --> 00:23:26.400
MIKE MCGEARY: The barbecue
is really good.

00:23:26.400 --> 00:23:27.780
KEVIN CALLAHAN: Yeah, the
barbecue is really good.

00:23:27.780 --> 00:23:28.630
MIKE MCGEARY: Hot
in the summer.

00:23:28.630 --> 00:23:31.460
KEVIN CALLAHAN: But yeah, so
the Immigration Act speaks

00:23:31.460 --> 00:23:33.250
volume-- to me, as a person,
I actually grew up--

00:23:33.250 --> 00:23:35.600
I lived in 12 different
countries growing up.

00:23:35.600 --> 00:23:37.930
My father was State
Department.

00:23:37.930 --> 00:23:40.560
I have friends all over the
world that never had the

00:23:40.560 --> 00:23:43.960
opportunity to come and work
here because of our system.

00:23:43.960 --> 00:23:48.320
So the JOBS Act or Startup Act
was really important to me.

00:23:48.320 --> 00:23:51.007
Another really important
thing with me is--

00:23:51.007 --> 00:23:54.400
or another topic we talked
about was the Electronic

00:23:54.400 --> 00:23:55.810
Communication Privacy Act.

00:23:55.810 --> 00:24:00.380
It's this 25-year-old act that
was put in place to deal with

00:24:00.380 --> 00:24:01.310
electronic information.

00:24:01.310 --> 00:24:04.970
And what that basically means
now is the government can take

00:24:04.970 --> 00:24:07.770
your emails, if they say, well,
we've already assumed

00:24:07.770 --> 00:24:10.940
you've read them, so then we
can use them, and use them

00:24:10.940 --> 00:24:13.630
against you without any sort
of legal recourse.

00:24:13.630 --> 00:24:14.780
So it's an outdated system.

00:24:14.780 --> 00:24:18.350
But what that does to me, as a
small business owner, who a

00:24:18.350 --> 00:24:21.630
lot with location data, who
deals a lot with health data--

00:24:21.630 --> 00:24:25.680
not health data, but about you,
because of the health and

00:24:25.680 --> 00:24:28.940
fitness apps we build, that
really sort of puts a burden

00:24:28.940 --> 00:24:31.770
on us in terms of being able
to comply should that ever

00:24:31.770 --> 00:24:33.250
happen to us.

00:24:33.250 --> 00:24:36.730
And so the idea is, well, let me
start talking about it now.

00:24:36.730 --> 00:24:39.490
Let me have the platform
to talk to a senator's

00:24:39.490 --> 00:24:45.530
legislative aide, so that if he
ever gets in a position to

00:24:45.530 --> 00:24:48.670
make a stance one way or
another, I know my voice has

00:24:48.670 --> 00:24:50.860
sort of been added to
that conversation.

00:24:50.860 --> 00:24:52.800
MIKE MCGEARY: And ECPA,
Electronic Communications

00:24:52.800 --> 00:24:55.770
Privacy Act, in a lot of ways--
we talked after SOPA,

00:24:55.770 --> 00:24:57.320
the next one was CISPA.

00:24:57.320 --> 00:24:59.130
And that was about
cyber security.

00:24:59.130 --> 00:25:03.720
In a lot of ways, ECPA actually
has even more, as

00:25:03.720 --> 00:25:05.760
it's written now before it's
being amended, is more

00:25:05.760 --> 00:25:08.030
detrimental consequences from a
Fourth Amendment standpoint

00:25:08.030 --> 00:25:11.780
in the United States, in terms
of search and seizure of

00:25:11.780 --> 00:25:14.350
online and private materials.

00:25:14.350 --> 00:25:16.900
And so it's good to see that
they're started to get wind of

00:25:16.900 --> 00:25:18.940
that and starting to ask
questions as well.

00:25:18.940 --> 00:25:21.030
And hopefully, it's more
than it's been

00:25:21.030 --> 00:25:22.390
cast in some circles.

00:25:22.390 --> 00:25:24.520
Which is, well, if we change
this, you'll be able to share

00:25:24.520 --> 00:25:26.580
what you watch on Netflix
on Facebook.

00:25:26.580 --> 00:25:29.820
Because that also stops you from
doing that, oddly enough.

00:25:29.820 --> 00:25:31.570
But there are some really
interesting Fourth Amendment

00:25:31.570 --> 00:25:32.160
implications there.

00:25:32.160 --> 00:25:34.640
So it's good to hear they're
working on that.

00:25:34.640 --> 00:25:36.380
OK, Jen.

00:25:36.380 --> 00:25:37.860
I know you didn't want me to
come to you first, so I

00:25:37.860 --> 00:25:41.040
definitely want to come back to
you now and talk more about

00:25:41.040 --> 00:25:43.330
the culture shift you're seeing
in cities around the

00:25:43.330 --> 00:25:45.450
country and some of the things
that you've been able to do

00:25:45.450 --> 00:25:46.530
there, first of all.

00:25:46.530 --> 00:25:48.790
But in a two-part question,
because you guys made a really

00:25:48.790 --> 00:25:51.880
brilliant hire recently in
hiring Catherine Bracy to do

00:25:51.880 --> 00:25:53.130
Code for All.

00:25:53.130 --> 00:25:55.740
If you guys don't follow @cbracy
on Twitter, make sure

00:25:55.740 --> 00:25:56.340
you're doing that.

00:25:56.340 --> 00:25:58.670
I'll get her a bunch of
followers right there.

00:25:58.670 --> 00:26:00.490
She's running Code for
All and helping with

00:26:00.490 --> 00:26:01.300
international strategy.

00:26:01.300 --> 00:26:02.270
I know we've got a lot
of international

00:26:02.270 --> 00:26:02.850
people in the room.

00:26:02.850 --> 00:26:05.590
So if you could touch on that,
but then also just generally

00:26:05.590 --> 00:26:10.955
like, where you've seen your own
advocacy take you, overall

00:26:10.955 --> 00:26:11.710
and broadly?

00:26:11.710 --> 00:26:13.850
And thinking about what Code for
American can do from that

00:26:13.850 --> 00:26:15.005
perspective.

00:26:15.005 --> 00:26:15.390
JEN PAHLKA: OK.

00:26:15.390 --> 00:26:17.620
So Catherine, if you're
watching, we'll count that as

00:26:17.620 --> 00:26:19.880
an announcement of
Code for All.

00:26:19.880 --> 00:26:21.020
MIKE MCGEARY: Sorry.

00:26:21.020 --> 00:26:21.640
JEN PAHLKA: It's cool.

00:26:21.640 --> 00:26:23.163
She was hoping someone would.

00:26:23.163 --> 00:26:24.050
MIKE MCGEARY: OK.

00:26:24.050 --> 00:26:25.300
JEN PAHLKA: Agree,
she's brilliant.

00:26:28.550 --> 00:26:30.380
You asked a couple questions
in there.

00:26:30.380 --> 00:26:31.750
One is about the culture.

00:26:31.750 --> 00:26:35.130
And I think that whatever
question you asked, it gives

00:26:35.130 --> 00:26:37.370
me an opportunity to make a good
point, which is that Code

00:26:37.370 --> 00:26:39.290
for America is about--

00:26:39.290 --> 00:26:40.640
we create apps.

00:26:40.640 --> 00:26:45.390
We work with governments, local
governments, on building

00:26:45.390 --> 00:26:46.290
these apps.

00:26:46.290 --> 00:26:49.130
The real outcome is that we're
using lean startup techniques.

00:26:49.130 --> 00:26:51.690
We're using user-centered
design.

00:26:51.690 --> 00:26:54.000
We're walking them through
a process that's vastly

00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:57.930
different from how technology
is usually bought or built

00:26:57.930 --> 00:26:58.870
within government.

00:26:58.870 --> 00:27:02.970
And the process that they go
through with us is actually

00:27:02.970 --> 00:27:05.600
more important than
the outcomes.

00:27:05.600 --> 00:27:08.270
The outcomes have been
successful and so it's been

00:27:08.270 --> 00:27:09.840
fun to be able to talk
about those.

00:27:09.840 --> 00:27:11.670
But what we talk about less
often, because it's sort of

00:27:11.670 --> 00:27:17.340
the follow-up question is, what
happens when somebody

00:27:17.340 --> 00:27:19.390
who's a technology person in
government goes through this

00:27:19.390 --> 00:27:23.280
process and sees that it is
possible to create an app in

00:27:23.280 --> 00:27:26.080
three months, that if it'd gone
through their procurement

00:27:26.080 --> 00:27:28.570
process would have taken--

00:27:28.570 --> 00:27:30.240
these are not random numbers.

00:27:30.240 --> 00:27:32.720
This is really from one
particular sample and we have

00:27:32.720 --> 00:27:33.700
many like them.

00:27:33.700 --> 00:27:36.070
A three-month app that we did
that they said would have

00:27:36.070 --> 00:27:39.490
taken at least 2 years and
cost at least $2 million.

00:27:39.490 --> 00:27:42.020
So that creates the political
will for change.

00:27:42.020 --> 00:27:45.310
And the real outcome here is
the culture virus effect of

00:27:45.310 --> 00:27:49.450
having someone go, oh my god,
we can do this differently.

00:27:49.450 --> 00:27:52.010
I'm going to go talk to a whole
bunch of people, other

00:27:52.010 --> 00:27:54.130
people who are on city
government and get them

00:27:54.130 --> 00:27:56.770
excited about a different
way of doing things.

00:27:56.770 --> 00:27:59.570
And to bring it back a little
bit though, I think to the

00:27:59.570 --> 00:28:03.510
sort of advocacy piece, I'm
talking about the flip side of

00:28:03.510 --> 00:28:07.420
what you guys are talking about
here, which is that the

00:28:07.420 --> 00:28:10.860
people in, especially federal
government, they think they

00:28:10.860 --> 00:28:11.810
know technology.

00:28:11.810 --> 00:28:15.340
They talk to a lot of companies
that do technology.

00:28:15.340 --> 00:28:18.740
And there's increasingly some
great people, great companies

00:28:18.740 --> 00:28:20.610
that are serving
the government.

00:28:20.610 --> 00:28:24.630
But there is an entrenched group
of companies there and

00:28:24.630 --> 00:28:27.390
they're often not the kinds
of companies that

00:28:27.390 --> 00:28:28.710
you people are starting.

00:28:28.710 --> 00:28:32.400
And so they don't know
these issues.

00:28:32.400 --> 00:28:35.690
And they're not getting the
benefit of the innovative

00:28:35.690 --> 00:28:39.770
approaches that we see in
the startup community.

00:28:39.770 --> 00:28:42.560
If the open question here
is, what is it?

00:28:42.560 --> 00:28:45.690
How can your startup
influence policy?

00:28:45.690 --> 00:28:47.460
This is the biggest
ask we can make.

00:28:47.460 --> 00:28:50.930
And I'm not asking for your year
of your time as a fellow,

00:28:50.930 --> 00:28:52.140
though we would love that too.

00:28:52.140 --> 00:28:54.860
And we are recruiting for
fellows for 2014.

00:28:54.860 --> 00:28:57.820
And it's an amazing,
amazing experience.

00:28:57.820 --> 00:29:00.350
But the biggest ask, really
because that's a one-year time

00:29:00.350 --> 00:29:03.770
limited thing, is start
a company that serves

00:29:03.770 --> 00:29:04.880
government.

00:29:04.880 --> 00:29:08.220
There are an enormous number of
opportunities to do that.

00:29:08.220 --> 00:29:11.080
Think about the way we regulate
right now and

00:29:11.080 --> 00:29:17.270
contrast it with how Matt
Cutts regulates spam and

00:29:17.270 --> 00:29:19.320
search quality results.

00:29:19.320 --> 00:29:22.190
We take three years to
change the law when--

00:29:22.190 --> 00:29:24.660
by the time we change
the regulation,

00:29:24.660 --> 00:29:26.020
it's completely outdated.

00:29:26.020 --> 00:29:28.100
We need algorithmic
regulation.

00:29:28.100 --> 00:29:31.550
There are companies that should
be built around that.

00:29:31.550 --> 00:29:33.380
I don't want to go on because
this could take all day.

00:29:33.380 --> 00:29:35.700
But there's a million great
companies that need to be

00:29:35.700 --> 00:29:37.720
built that can serve
government.

00:29:37.720 --> 00:29:41.960
And I know most of you think
about it, like no way in hell.

00:29:41.960 --> 00:29:43.010
I'm not going to
go through that

00:29:43.010 --> 00:29:46.270
two-year procurement process.

00:29:46.270 --> 00:29:49.400
I want to make great product.

00:29:49.400 --> 00:29:51.240
I don't want to work
on paperwork.

00:29:51.240 --> 00:29:52.110
But the thing you need
to understand

00:29:52.110 --> 00:29:53.680
is that that's changing.

00:29:53.680 --> 00:29:55.420
It may be changing slowly
and me may be in the

00:29:55.420 --> 00:29:56.940
beginning of it.

00:29:56.940 --> 00:30:00.950
But part of this culture change
is the will to do

00:30:00.950 --> 00:30:04.480
procurement differently,
to open the government

00:30:04.480 --> 00:30:07.740
contracting system up to a
whole new set of vendors.

00:30:07.740 --> 00:30:10.310
There's a great project
that was just

00:30:10.310 --> 00:30:11.730
released called Procurio.

00:30:11.730 --> 00:30:15.150
Or I think it was originally
called RFP-EZ, which allows

00:30:15.150 --> 00:30:19.670
your average 30-person web
shop to bid on a federal

00:30:19.670 --> 00:30:23.020
website contract.

00:30:23.020 --> 00:30:25.580
Clay Johnson released this video
recently where he talked

00:30:25.580 --> 00:30:27.990
about the fact that the
president just announced

00:30:27.990 --> 00:30:30.610
initiative to map
the human brain.

00:30:30.610 --> 00:30:33.070
And it's going to cost a hundred
million dollars.

00:30:33.070 --> 00:30:36.190
We routinely spend something
like 150--

00:30:36.190 --> 00:30:40.470
in this case, $188 million on
one government website.

00:30:40.470 --> 00:30:44.090
Do you think you guys could do
a decent government website

00:30:44.090 --> 00:30:46.720
for less than $188 million?

00:30:46.720 --> 00:30:48.440
I think you probably could.

00:30:48.440 --> 00:30:49.240
That's our money.

00:30:49.240 --> 00:30:50.290
That's our taxpayer money.

00:30:50.290 --> 00:30:52.600
And the benefit of it is if you
get in there and you're

00:30:52.600 --> 00:30:55.860
working in government, then
our leaders in government

00:30:55.860 --> 00:30:58.760
actually have an understanding
of the issues that you're

00:30:58.760 --> 00:30:59.590
dealing with, too.

00:30:59.590 --> 00:31:01.070
So it all comes together.

00:31:01.070 --> 00:31:04.030
And this was a very long ad,
which I will wrap up for our

00:31:04.030 --> 00:31:06.520
Code for America Accelerator,
which is accepting

00:31:06.520 --> 00:31:09.090
applications through the
end of this month.

00:31:09.090 --> 00:31:11.110
But there's a lot of different
ways that you can do it.

00:31:11.110 --> 00:31:11.930
That's one important one.

00:31:11.930 --> 00:31:13.280
MIKE MCGEARY: Well, and the most
interesting thing for me

00:31:13.280 --> 00:31:15.830
with what Clay did with
RFP-EZ, which is

00:31:15.830 --> 00:31:17.380
now Procurio, is--

00:31:17.380 --> 00:31:18.710
that was a government program.

00:31:18.710 --> 00:31:20.490
He was a presidential
innovation fellow.

00:31:20.490 --> 00:31:23.450
He worked with Todd Park, the
US Chief Technology Officer.

00:31:23.450 --> 00:31:24.580
It was in the White House.

00:31:24.580 --> 00:31:27.760
It was a very much, very
structured program that's now

00:31:27.760 --> 00:31:32.890
been spun out and has become
it's own private entity.

00:31:32.890 --> 00:31:36.390
That's starting to now bleed
out and help people.

00:31:36.390 --> 00:31:39.010
I've said this before I think,
but government's really good

00:31:39.010 --> 00:31:40.940
at spending $100 million
or a billion

00:31:40.940 --> 00:31:41.640
dollars of taxpayer money.

00:31:41.640 --> 00:31:44.380
They're not really good
at spending $25,000.

00:31:44.380 --> 00:31:46.460
And that's where, especially in
the kind of products that

00:31:46.460 --> 00:31:49.860
you guys are all building,
that's where a lot of the meat

00:31:49.860 --> 00:31:52.310
can really happen, where the
rubber can meet the road.

00:31:52.310 --> 00:31:54.410
JEN PAHLKA: And by the way, two
of the Code for America

00:31:54.410 --> 00:31:56.620
teams this year, in addition
to the other work they're

00:31:56.620 --> 00:31:58.500
doing with their city
partners, are

00:31:58.500 --> 00:32:00.020
implementing Procurio.

00:32:00.020 --> 00:32:02.770
So we tie between what happens
at the local level and what

00:32:02.770 --> 00:32:04.230
happens at the federal level.

00:32:04.230 --> 00:32:05.400
MIKE MCGEARY: That's great.

00:32:05.400 --> 00:32:06.800
That's encouraging to hear.

00:32:06.800 --> 00:32:08.790
We've got a few minutes left.

00:32:08.790 --> 00:32:12.190
So if there are questions, I'm
going to encourage you to run

00:32:12.190 --> 00:32:13.400
up to-- oh, there
are questions.

00:32:13.400 --> 00:32:15.700
This is fantastic.

00:32:15.700 --> 00:32:17.250
So let's do that.

00:32:17.250 --> 00:32:19.460
And then, we'll take a couple
questions and have some

00:32:19.460 --> 00:32:20.120
closing remarks.

00:32:20.120 --> 00:32:22.710
But I'll start at the front
microphone, the gentleman in

00:32:22.710 --> 00:32:23.380
the green shirt.

00:32:23.380 --> 00:32:25.760
AUDIENCE: So I have
to-- is this on?

00:32:25.760 --> 00:32:28.480
So I have to piggyback on
that last conversation.

00:32:28.480 --> 00:32:31.230
So from the opposite side of
the spectrum, so I'm a

00:32:31.230 --> 00:32:34.420
technology professional within
the government, having the

00:32:34.420 --> 00:32:37.120
problem of going through the
acquisition challenges of both

00:32:37.120 --> 00:32:41.460
the FAR and the DFARS and other
types of legislation,

00:32:41.460 --> 00:32:44.020
it's very, very difficult, even
if you work with the open

00:32:44.020 --> 00:32:46.630
source advocates across the
community, to push out

00:32:46.630 --> 00:32:48.500
capabilities so that you can
get people to work on it.

00:32:48.500 --> 00:32:52.260
You can't get the money out to
be able to take multimillion

00:32:52.260 --> 00:32:55.080
dollar programs and actually
make them efficient with

00:32:55.080 --> 00:32:57.840
smaller teams across the
US or otherwise.

00:32:57.840 --> 00:32:59.130
Do you know what's going on?

00:32:59.130 --> 00:33:01.580
So I haven't heard of that
particular initiative.

00:33:01.580 --> 00:33:03.710
Are there other things to be
looking into that there's

00:33:03.710 --> 00:33:06.880
actually top cover of actually
changing the implementation of

00:33:06.880 --> 00:33:10.080
the DFARS and so forth?

00:33:10.080 --> 00:33:11.360
JEN PAHLKA: Federal Acquisition

00:33:11.360 --> 00:33:13.500
Regulation, is that FAR?

00:33:13.500 --> 00:33:14.265
AUDIENCE: So that's the FAR.

00:33:14.265 --> 00:33:17.650
And then there's other nuanced
iterations of that.

00:33:17.650 --> 00:33:20.820
JEN PAHLKA: So this, to me
again, this is the awkward--

00:33:20.820 --> 00:33:22.000
you guys can answer, too.

00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:26.400
This is the operating code that
is sort of bloated, that

00:33:26.400 --> 00:33:27.450
we need to get at.

00:33:27.450 --> 00:33:30.390
And we're not there yet.

00:33:30.390 --> 00:33:34.020
I think where this movement
is, is proving that it can

00:33:34.020 --> 00:33:36.840
work in a couple of
limited cases.

00:33:36.840 --> 00:33:40.450
So Procurio really was built
just for one use case just to

00:33:40.450 --> 00:33:44.250
start, which was a sort
of basic website.

00:33:44.250 --> 00:33:45.310
It's got content.

00:33:45.310 --> 00:33:46.630
It has a little bit
of interactivity.

00:33:46.630 --> 00:33:49.540
It's probably pulling some
data from some database.

00:33:49.540 --> 00:33:53.500
And anybody here could
probably do this.

00:33:53.500 --> 00:33:55.670
What I would suggest--

00:33:55.670 --> 00:33:59.450
so it starts to create that
conversation, which leads to

00:33:59.450 --> 00:34:02.260
OK, these are laws
and regulations

00:34:02.260 --> 00:34:03.490
that need to be changed.

00:34:03.490 --> 00:34:06.673
But I would recommend for you,
in the situation that you're

00:34:06.673 --> 00:34:08.420
at, to look at the Presidential
Innovation

00:34:08.420 --> 00:34:10.110
Fellows program.

00:34:10.110 --> 00:34:15.679
That's the way that Todd Park,
this federal CTO, and Steve

00:34:15.679 --> 00:34:19.739
VanRoekel, the CIO, are trying
to pull these sort of

00:34:19.739 --> 00:34:23.530
over-complicated processes
together and say, we're going

00:34:23.530 --> 00:34:25.530
to create a little space
here for innovation.

00:34:25.530 --> 00:34:27.190
We're going to take this process
and we're going to

00:34:27.190 --> 00:34:30.690
say, we can do something with
this in six months.

00:34:30.690 --> 00:34:33.110
We're going to have something
that works at the end of six

00:34:33.110 --> 00:34:34.860
months, whether it kills us--

00:34:34.860 --> 00:34:36.250
even if it kills us.

00:34:36.250 --> 00:34:38.530
And then, from there you kind
of build back into, OK, how

00:34:38.530 --> 00:34:40.940
does this now become a
sustainable thing that works

00:34:40.940 --> 00:34:44.790
differently from the bloated
process that went before?

00:34:44.790 --> 00:34:45.685
Does that help?

00:34:45.685 --> 00:34:46.880
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:34:46.880 --> 00:34:48.520
Again, it's one of those things
where there's been a

00:34:48.520 --> 00:34:50.679
lot of talk about this for a
number years across the actual

00:34:50.679 --> 00:34:51.489
government circles.

00:34:51.489 --> 00:34:53.090
Whether it be through different

00:34:53.090 --> 00:34:55.290
CIO shops, or otherwise.

00:34:55.290 --> 00:34:57.980
And curious how it's progressing
from the actual

00:34:57.980 --> 00:34:59.960
community side outside
of that.

00:34:59.960 --> 00:35:01.240
JEN PAHLKA: There's no one--

00:35:01.240 --> 00:35:02.220
I'll try to be brief.

00:35:02.220 --> 00:35:05.080
There is no one effort that
can fix everything.

00:35:05.080 --> 00:35:08.170
I think, to your point before
about a platform that has

00:35:08.170 --> 00:35:11.740
emergent outcomes, the best
thing that we know how to do--

00:35:11.740 --> 00:35:13.840
and I wish we knew
how to fix this--

00:35:13.840 --> 00:35:16.680
is to tell the stories that
create the political will for

00:35:16.680 --> 00:35:20.730
change and create the
environment and opportunity

00:35:20.730 --> 00:35:23.900
for other people to stand up and
say, this needs to change.

00:35:23.900 --> 00:35:25.420
We're going to do this, too.

00:35:25.420 --> 00:35:25.640
KEVIN CALLAHAN: Yeah.

00:35:25.640 --> 00:35:29.060
And I'm a little bit of an
outsider in terms of

00:35:29.060 --> 00:35:31.560
government process and
regulations, but I know with

00:35:31.560 --> 00:35:35.290
Obama's executive order last
week mandating that all

00:35:35.290 --> 00:35:39.160
government data is accessible,
machine readable, et cetera.

00:35:39.160 --> 00:35:42.510
Depending on what your need,
Code for America actually has

00:35:42.510 --> 00:35:44.000
brigades in cities.

00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:47.070
And so if it's something that's
really important to you

00:35:47.070 --> 00:35:49.540
and that you think you make a
big difference, contact the

00:35:49.540 --> 00:35:52.560
local brigade and see when
their next hackathon is.

00:35:52.560 --> 00:35:54.460
Because potentially, they could
prototype something out,

00:35:54.460 --> 00:35:57.825
if whatever you're doing has
that type of data available

00:35:57.825 --> 00:35:58.700
out in the wild.

00:35:58.700 --> 00:35:59.490
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:35:59.490 --> 00:36:01.440
MIKE MCGEARY: I want to go
to the back microphone.

00:36:01.440 --> 00:36:03.415
We just do have a few minutes,
so we'll keep going.

00:36:03.415 --> 00:36:04.245
Thanks for your question.

00:36:04.245 --> 00:36:05.160
AUDIENCE: Yeah, thanks.

00:36:05.160 --> 00:36:08.150
My name is Mike, and I work
in political data in DC.

00:36:08.150 --> 00:36:11.080
So I might be one of the
bad people here.

00:36:11.080 --> 00:36:14.260
But one of the common threads
that you all were talking

00:36:14.260 --> 00:36:18.220
about was it seems that there's
a big failure of being

00:36:18.220 --> 00:36:21.430
able to connect citizens to
the people who can make

00:36:21.430 --> 00:36:24.240
something actually happen,
whether or not it was the

00:36:24.240 --> 00:36:27.810
bureaucrats, or the people
crafting legislation, or the

00:36:27.810 --> 00:36:30.440
people who will end up voting
on legislation in the end,

00:36:30.440 --> 00:36:32.150
trying to persuade them.

00:36:32.150 --> 00:36:36.941
My question is, how
do we solve that?

00:36:36.941 --> 00:36:42.010
MIKE MCGEARY: I want to just
briefly say-- and I guess

00:36:42.010 --> 00:36:43.990
somehow, even growing up a Red
Sox fan, I turned into an

00:36:43.990 --> 00:36:44.740
eternal optimist.

00:36:44.740 --> 00:36:46.650
But I would say that more than
this being a moment of

00:36:46.650 --> 00:36:48.600
failure, it's a moment
of opportunity.

00:36:48.600 --> 00:36:52.460
That with the proliferation of
tools on the internet and

00:36:52.460 --> 00:36:54.760
platforms that have been built,
there are numerous

00:36:54.760 --> 00:36:57.630
different ways for you now to
take action to make that

00:36:57.630 --> 00:36:58.540
system better.

00:36:58.540 --> 00:37:00.420
Whether it's being a
presidential innovation fellow

00:37:00.420 --> 00:37:02.890
at that level, or working with
your Code for America brigade,

00:37:02.890 --> 00:37:06.700
or taking action on a political
issue, or working

00:37:06.700 --> 00:37:09.760
with your local police
department to help them

00:37:09.760 --> 00:37:12.460
understand the data that they
have that they don't

00:37:12.460 --> 00:37:13.330
even know they have.

00:37:13.330 --> 00:37:15.370
And how it can be
cross-referenced with public

00:37:15.370 --> 00:37:16.810
health data to help make
your city stronger.

00:37:16.810 --> 00:37:20.360
There are ways to do all of
this on the ones and zeros

00:37:20.360 --> 00:37:22.940
level, and to build applications
off that in ways

00:37:22.940 --> 00:37:24.110
they haven't before.

00:37:24.110 --> 00:37:27.020
Procurio is a great way
to think about it.

00:37:27.020 --> 00:37:29.580
And that now you can build that
and the city can purchase

00:37:29.580 --> 00:37:30.720
it and use it.

00:37:30.720 --> 00:37:31.500
Imagine that.

00:37:31.500 --> 00:37:32.980
They just haven't been able
to do that before.

00:37:32.980 --> 00:37:35.520
So less a moment of failure,
more a moment of opportunity.

00:37:35.520 --> 00:37:37.120
I don't know if anybody else
has thoughts there?

00:37:39.920 --> 00:37:41.280
KEVIN CALLAHAN: Yeah.

00:37:41.280 --> 00:37:43.210
On a local level, you can
actually make more of an

00:37:43.210 --> 00:37:44.430
impact than you think you can.

00:37:44.430 --> 00:37:47.960
Because local level, you don't
necessarily have to solve a

00:37:47.960 --> 00:37:51.110
federal issue if something
is local for you.

00:37:51.110 --> 00:37:54.400
So just go to a city council
meeting and just start seeing

00:37:54.400 --> 00:37:56.330
who's talking about what.

00:37:56.330 --> 00:37:58.740
And just get involved.

00:37:58.740 --> 00:38:01.970
JEN PAHLKA: We use the word
"conversation" a lot.

00:38:01.970 --> 00:38:05.020
And I think it's important--
we're talking in some cases

00:38:05.020 --> 00:38:08.730
about getting our elected
leaders to listen to us and

00:38:08.730 --> 00:38:10.500
our bureaucrats to
listen to us.

00:38:10.500 --> 00:38:14.020
And the other side of it is, are
we listening to the data?

00:38:14.020 --> 00:38:14.820
Are we listening?

00:38:14.820 --> 00:38:16.890
Are we playing that back?

00:38:16.890 --> 00:38:19.700
And I think your example of
police data's a perfect one.

00:38:19.700 --> 00:38:21.710
But there's a bunch of others.

00:38:21.710 --> 00:38:24.030
That data is there.

00:38:24.030 --> 00:38:29.400
When your local IT guy in your
town actually puts that data

00:38:29.400 --> 00:38:33.960
out there, it is your job to
go listen to that data.

00:38:33.960 --> 00:38:35.960
They are opening a conversation
with you.

00:38:35.960 --> 00:38:37.860
Show up.

00:38:37.860 --> 00:38:38.535
Look at it.

00:38:38.535 --> 00:38:39.710
Do something with it.

00:38:39.710 --> 00:38:42.730
We talk about, at Code for
America, that we're creating

00:38:42.730 --> 00:38:45.270
interfaces to government that
are simple, beautiful, and

00:38:45.270 --> 00:38:47.070
easy to use.

00:38:47.070 --> 00:38:50.120
That actually is your role to
create those interfaces

00:38:50.120 --> 00:38:52.900
because the average person goes
and looks at that data

00:38:52.900 --> 00:38:54.720
and goes, what the WTF?

00:38:54.720 --> 00:38:56.840
I don't know this stuff is.

00:38:56.840 --> 00:38:59.240
But that is the start of a
conversation and we have to

00:38:59.240 --> 00:39:02.280
meet those people halfway.

00:39:02.280 --> 00:39:03.730
MIKE MCGEARY: I think we've
got time for one more, and

00:39:03.730 --> 00:39:05.710
then we'll all be here for a
couple of minutes afterwards.

00:39:05.710 --> 00:39:07.750
You can grab us individually.

00:39:07.750 --> 00:39:08.910
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:39:08.910 --> 00:39:09.895
I'm from Latin America.

00:39:09.895 --> 00:39:12.620
I'm from Colombia, actually.

00:39:12.620 --> 00:39:17.380
Well, our governments also have
a couple of stupid, and

00:39:17.380 --> 00:39:20.180
crazy regulations like
SOPA and PIPA.

00:39:20.180 --> 00:39:23.360
It's everywhere in Latin
America, Colombia, Venezuela,

00:39:23.360 --> 00:39:24.610
Mexico, Chile.

00:39:27.820 --> 00:39:33.450
If they copy, and just they want
to copy, even they are

00:39:33.450 --> 00:39:37.660
not conscious about what
they are doing.

00:39:37.660 --> 00:39:42.780
Will you suggest to create
like a union for Latin

00:39:42.780 --> 00:39:48.620
American countries of people
like you increasing the

00:39:48.620 --> 00:39:51.800
consciousness of entrepreneurs,
business

00:39:51.800 --> 00:39:57.390
professionals, and general users
on the internet from

00:39:57.390 --> 00:40:05.460
this kind of movement from our
governments that just want to

00:40:05.460 --> 00:40:07.710
facilitate the [INAUDIBLE]

00:40:07.710 --> 00:40:11.050
and censorship of our internet
in Latin America?

00:40:11.050 --> 00:40:13.300
MIKE MCGEARY: There are groups
like that that are starting

00:40:13.300 --> 00:40:15.090
all over the world every day.

00:40:15.090 --> 00:40:17.670
We work particularly with groups
like Coalition for a

00:40:17.670 --> 00:40:20.370
Digital Economy in the UK.

00:40:20.370 --> 00:40:22.850
We just did something with
France Digitale in Western

00:40:22.850 --> 00:40:24.580
Europe, this week as well.

00:40:24.580 --> 00:40:26.900
And we work with groups in
Europe, Latin America, all

00:40:26.900 --> 00:40:28.920
around the world that are
starting to get together.

00:40:28.920 --> 00:40:30.780
They're in a little
bit nascent stage.

00:40:30.780 --> 00:40:32.200
And of course, with the
individual political

00:40:32.200 --> 00:40:36.040
situations in a lot of these
countries, that changes the

00:40:36.040 --> 00:40:39.690
focus and the ability to engage
in a lot of ways.

00:40:39.690 --> 00:40:42.190
But yeah, I would encourage
you to do exactly that.

00:40:42.190 --> 00:40:45.260
Find the startups founders that
understand that there is

00:40:45.260 --> 00:40:48.590
a direct impact, and that they
have that impact on the

00:40:48.590 --> 00:40:51.250
economic forces at play in
government, on communities

00:40:51.250 --> 00:40:54.150
themselves, and on government
at the highest level with

00:40:54.150 --> 00:40:57.120
being able to do things like
make bureaucracies more

00:40:57.120 --> 00:40:59.530
efficient and work for
the people more.

00:40:59.530 --> 00:41:02.590
And if you get those people
together, and you're able to

00:41:02.590 --> 00:41:06.020
galvanize them in a way that
allows them to think about

00:41:06.020 --> 00:41:08.470
these issues and then take
action, that you really can

00:41:08.470 --> 00:41:10.900
have an impact, no matter
where you are.

00:41:10.900 --> 00:41:14.010
Again, that's a little bit of
the optimist in me, but there

00:41:14.010 --> 00:41:15.900
are groups like that that
are forming every day.

00:41:15.900 --> 00:41:17.940
If there's not one in Colombia
yet, I think you

00:41:17.940 --> 00:41:19.322
ought to start it.

00:41:19.322 --> 00:41:21.990
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:41:21.990 --> 00:41:24.010
MIKE MCGEARY: So two
quick things.

00:41:24.010 --> 00:41:25.080
We got to wrap it up there.

00:41:25.080 --> 00:41:26.070
They're going to kick us out.

00:41:26.070 --> 00:41:28.230
Thank you all for being here.

00:41:28.230 --> 00:41:30.410
We'll stick around and answer
questions individually.

00:41:30.410 --> 00:41:33.860
And I am doing office hours
tomorrow, if you really want

00:41:33.860 --> 00:41:35.510
to talk to me for any reason.

00:41:35.510 --> 00:41:40.680
I'm at Google Developers
something.

00:41:40.680 --> 00:41:43.240
Google Developers Group
at 11 o'clock.

00:41:43.240 --> 00:41:47.430
And I will answer any random
questions you have, including

00:41:47.430 --> 00:41:49.690
about Red Sox history
and optimism.

00:41:49.690 --> 00:41:51.270
But thank you all
for being here.

00:41:51.270 --> 00:41:55.290
I hope this was informative,
and enjoy the rest of I/O.
