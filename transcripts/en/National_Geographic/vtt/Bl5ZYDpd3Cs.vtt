- Geladas aren't
afraid of all predators.

00:00:04.103 --> 00:00:06.606
You're looking at
the Ethiopian wolf.

00:00:06.606 --> 00:00:08.374
This occurs on the Guassa,

00:00:08.374 --> 00:00:11.144
and it's the rarest
canid in the world.

00:00:11.144 --> 00:00:14.113
There's only about 400
remaining in Ethiopia,

00:00:14.113 --> 00:00:16.583
and 40 of them are at Guassa.

00:00:16.583 --> 00:00:18.084
They're social,

00:00:18.084 --> 00:00:19.585
but during the day,

00:00:19.585 --> 00:00:23.490 line:0%
you see them mostly alone
out hunting for rodents.

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:24.757 line:0%
Back in 2008,

00:00:24.757 --> 00:00:28.261 line:0%
Jeff and I would often
see scenes like this.

00:00:30.763 --> 00:00:33.032 align:start size:84% position:16%
Ethiopian wolves
stalking for rodents

00:00:33.032 --> 00:00:35.602
in the middle of
herds of geladas.

00:00:35.602 --> 00:00:39.271 align:start size:94% position:6%
We didn't really think
much about it at the time,

00:00:39.271 --> 00:00:41.508
because we saw it so often.

00:00:42.975 --> 00:00:45.278
- [Jeff] We didn't have very
good cameras back then either.

00:00:45.278 --> 00:00:46.679
(laughter)

00:00:46.679 --> 00:00:47.514
- Clearly.

00:00:49.081 --> 00:00:50.082
Years later,

00:00:50.082 --> 00:00:51.617
after reading some literature,

00:00:51.617 --> 00:00:54.687 align:start size:97% position:3%
we realized that this was a
really weird thing to observe.

00:00:54.687 --> 00:00:57.791
To observe this carnivore in
the middle of a herd of monkeys

00:00:57.791 --> 00:01:01.828 align:start size:94% position:6%
and they're basically
just ignoring each other.

00:01:01.828 --> 00:01:04.230
Why isn't the wolf going
and grabbing a baby gelada

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:05.665
as a snack?

00:01:05.665 --> 00:01:08.100 align:start size:97% position:3%
Why isn't it getting chased
off by these monkeys?

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:12.671 align:start size:97% position:3%
So it seemed like a phenomenon
worthy of more study.

00:01:12.671 --> 00:01:15.074
So I wrote a grant to
National Geographic,

00:01:15.074 --> 00:01:16.642
a Young Explorers Grant,

00:01:16.642 --> 00:01:18.110
and in 2011,

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:20.779
we had a reason and some
money to go back to Guassa.

00:01:20.779 --> 00:01:23.049
So Jeff and I teamed up again.

00:01:23.049 --> 00:01:24.283
On this trip,

00:01:24.283 --> 00:01:26.752 align:start size:81% position:19%
we followed wolves
around all day.

00:01:26.752 --> 00:01:28.855
Walking dozens of
kilometers a day.

00:01:28.855 --> 00:01:30.856 align:start size:88% position:13%
And we watched the
behavior of these wolves

00:01:30.856 --> 00:01:32.625
when they were with geladas,

00:01:32.625 --> 00:01:33.926
and when they were alone,

00:01:33.926 --> 00:01:35.861
so we could make a comparison.

00:01:35.861 --> 00:01:38.230 align:start position:0%
What we found is that these
wolves gain an important benefit

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:40.233
by the presence of the monkeys.

00:01:40.233 --> 00:01:42.468
So they spend more of
their effort foraging

00:01:42.468 --> 00:01:43.969
when they're near monkeys,

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:47.907
and they also catch more
rodents per unit time.

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:51.677 align:start position:0%
But they can't do anything
when they're among the monkeys.

00:01:51.677 --> 00:01:55.281 align:start size:97% position:3%
They have to adhere to
certain rules of engagement.

00:01:55.281 --> 00:01:56.882
So they can't move too fast.

00:01:56.882 --> 00:01:58.384
They're not allowed to run.

00:01:58.384 --> 00:02:00.320
And if they get within two
or three meters of a monkey,

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:01.988
they get chased off.

00:02:03.089 --> 00:02:04.590
As far as we can tell,

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:06.792 align:start size:97% position:3%
the monkeys don't get anything
really positive or negative

00:02:06.792 --> 00:02:08.294
out of this.

00:02:08.294 --> 00:02:11.831
But this is a very rare kind
of mixed species interaction.

00:02:11.831 --> 00:02:16.435 align:start position:0%
To have a predator stalking
among a potential prey species,

00:02:16.435 --> 00:02:19.105
peacefully ignoring each other.

00:02:19.105 --> 00:02:20.974 align:start size:97% position:3%
So we wrote up a scientific
paper about this,

00:02:20.974 --> 00:02:22.241
submitted it.

00:02:22.241 --> 00:02:24.510
It was published in a
journal of mammalogy.

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:26.079
And when the paper came out,

00:02:26.079 --> 00:02:29.315
we also got some press
that really surprised us.

00:02:29.315 --> 00:02:32.818 align:start size:84% position:16%
Are monkeys
domesticating wolves?

00:02:32.818 --> 00:02:34.487
Now this was really surprising

00:02:34.487 --> 00:02:37.256 align:start size:97% position:3%
because we hadn't mentioned
the D word anywhere,

00:02:37.256 --> 00:02:42.127
and I can tell you for a fact
that this is not occurring.

00:02:42.127 --> 00:02:43.963
There we go.

00:02:43.963 --> 00:02:45.497
So as far as we know,

00:02:45.497 --> 00:02:47.499 align:start size:97% position:3%
this kind of interaction is
actually unique to the Guassa,

00:02:47.499 --> 00:02:49.302
it only happens at the Guassa.

00:02:49.302 --> 00:02:51.637
This is because of the
fragmented species ranges

00:02:51.637 --> 00:02:55.007
of Ethiopian wolves and geladas.

00:02:55.007 --> 00:02:57.042
But we can suppose
that in the past,

00:02:57.042 --> 00:02:59.712
maybe this interaction
was more widespread.

00:02:59.712 --> 00:03:03.482
And some supporting evidence
for this comes from a mosaic

00:03:03.482 --> 00:03:07.119
that's 2000 years old that
you actually saw earlier.

00:03:07.119 --> 00:03:09.789
This mosaic depicts the Nile.

00:03:09.789 --> 00:03:11.290
And toward the top,

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:14.994 align:start size:97% position:3%
we have the origin of the Nile
in the Ethiopian highlands.

00:03:14.994 --> 00:03:16.729
I'll direct your attention

00:03:16.729 --> 00:03:19.465 align:start size:84% position:16%
to two sets of
archers on the left,

00:03:19.465 --> 00:03:23.869 align:start position:0%
and then near the rocky
outcropping in the middle there.

00:03:23.869 --> 00:03:25.772
So we see on the left,

00:03:25.772 --> 00:03:27.172
the sphingia.

00:03:27.172 --> 00:03:28.974
The sphinx monkey of earlier.

00:03:28.974 --> 00:03:29.976
And on the right,

00:03:29.976 --> 00:03:31.377
the Ethiopian wolf.

00:03:31.377 --> 00:03:33.679 align:start size:88% position:13%
So I think it's striking
that 2000 years ago,

00:03:33.679 --> 00:03:36.415
artists were portraying these
species in the same frame,

00:03:36.415 --> 00:03:39.886
just like in Jeff's photographs.

00:03:39.886 --> 00:03:42.221
This highlights to me
what's really special

00:03:42.221 --> 00:03:43.422
about the Guassa.

00:03:43.422 --> 00:03:45.991 align:start size:84% position:16%
It preserves not only
species diversity

00:03:45.991 --> 00:03:47.660
and genetic diversity,

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:49.728
but a different
kind of diversity

00:03:49.728 --> 00:03:51.631
which is behavioral diversity.

00:03:51.631 --> 00:03:55.267
This is what allows animals to
adapt to changing conditions,

00:03:55.267 --> 00:03:59.439
and that's really important
going into the 21st century.

00:04:03.942 --> 00:04:05.511 align:start size:84% position:16%
- I was always
frustrated coming back

00:04:05.511 --> 00:04:06.979
from some of these trips,

00:04:06.979 --> 00:04:10.082
trying to talk about concepts
like behavioral diversity,

00:04:10.082 --> 00:04:13.919 align:start size:84% position:16%
or just describing
the scenes that I saw.

00:04:13.919 --> 00:04:18.091 align:start size:97% position:3%
And I dealt with this by
turning towards photography.

00:04:19.425 --> 00:04:21.894 align:start size:88% position:13% line:0%
Since 2008 and our
crappy camera technology,

00:04:21.894 --> 00:04:23.129 line:0%
we got some newer cameras

00:04:23.129 --> 00:04:25.031 line:0%
and we had a lot of
time in the field.

00:04:25.031 --> 00:04:27.267 line:0%
And I found this was a
nice way to intersect

00:04:27.267 --> 00:04:30.703 line:0%
my scientific work with
communicating this work

00:04:30.703 --> 00:04:32.038
to other people.

00:04:33.372 --> 00:04:37.209 align:start size:97% position:3%
And it's been a very fruitful
kind of collaboration

00:04:37.209 --> 00:04:39.045
between these two ideas.

00:04:39.045 --> 00:04:42.214
It's a great way to improve
the messaging of science,

00:04:42.214 --> 00:04:43.582
but many of the photos

00:04:43.582 --> 00:04:45.784 align:start size:84% position:16%
that you've seen today
are end products.

00:04:45.784 --> 00:04:47.986
They don't start out like this.

00:04:47.986 --> 00:04:51.290
A photo for me often
starts off as an idea.

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:52.491
I see something,

00:04:52.491 --> 00:04:54.693 align:start size:88% position:13%
I'm like I wanna capture
the essence of that.

00:04:54.693 --> 00:04:56.229 align:start size:84% position:16%
And we can just
kind of explore this

00:04:56.229 --> 00:04:58.297
in a very simple example.

00:04:58.297 --> 00:05:01.534
I like watching geladas
jump across streams.

00:05:01.534 --> 00:05:02.868
To me it's interesting,

00:05:02.868 --> 00:05:04.703
it's a cool dynamic behavior,

00:05:04.703 --> 00:05:06.472 align:start size:84% position:16%
and I wanted to
take a picture of it

00:05:06.472 --> 00:05:08.907 align:start size:81% position:19%
that just captured
the way I felt.

00:05:08.907 --> 00:05:12.178
And I tried and tried and tried,

00:05:12.178 --> 00:05:14.446 align:start size:97% position:3%
and some of these are
interesting pictures perhaps

00:05:14.446 --> 00:05:16.115
but they didn't quite connect.

00:05:16.115 --> 00:05:18.685 align:start size:88% position:13%
And I ran through trying
an infrared camera,

00:05:18.685 --> 00:05:20.086
long exposures,

00:05:20.086 --> 00:05:22.822
cutting geladas heads off.

00:05:22.822 --> 00:05:26.592
But when it comes to this
to get a nice picture,

00:05:26.592 --> 00:05:28.027
it requires persistence.

00:05:28.027 --> 00:05:30.429 align:start size:94% position:6%
And for all of these
it's just trial and trial

00:05:30.429 --> 00:05:32.464
and trial and mostly failure.

00:05:32.464 --> 00:05:34.467 align:start size:88% position:13%
Eventually I end up with
a picture like this.

00:05:34.467 --> 00:05:36.268
Which is not a perfect
picture by any means,

00:05:36.268 --> 00:05:39.205 align:start position:0%
but it's much closer to the
feeling that I wanted to capture

00:05:39.205 --> 00:05:43.409 align:start size:88% position:13%
with the monkey jumping
across the stream.

00:05:43.409 --> 00:05:45.611
So I've learned an immense
amount about photography

00:05:45.611 --> 00:05:48.347
by partnering with
other photographers.

00:05:48.347 --> 00:05:51.384
I remember I first came back
from the monkey-wolf project

00:05:51.384 --> 00:05:53.719
Vivek and I were doing
solely as researchers,

00:05:53.719 --> 00:05:55.788 align:start size:94% position:6%
and had this huge
collection of photographs,

00:05:55.788 --> 00:05:58.024
and I was showing them
to a couple of people.

00:05:58.024 --> 00:05:59.058
And I met this guy,

00:05:59.058 --> 00:06:00.526
Trevor Frost.

00:06:00.526 --> 00:06:02.060
And he took a look
at the pictures,

00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:04.196
like oh that seems like a
pretty interesting place.

00:06:04.196 --> 00:06:06.865
Have you thought about trying
to do a photo essay of that?

00:06:06.865 --> 00:06:09.768
To kind of describe the
place in more detail.

00:06:09.768 --> 00:06:11.437 align:start size:84% position:16%
I was like I have
thousands of pictures.

00:06:11.437 --> 00:06:13.773
Like it's already a photo
essay just pick a couple.

00:06:13.773 --> 00:06:16.075
He's like I don't think you
understand how this works.

00:06:16.075 --> 00:06:18.543
Why don't we write a grant
and we can go back together

00:06:18.543 --> 00:06:21.814
and try to tell this
story professionally?

00:06:21.814 --> 00:06:25.250
I was like wait they give
you grants for photography?

00:06:25.250 --> 00:06:28.020
I had this very biologist
centric view of the world

00:06:28.020 --> 00:06:30.455 align:start size:84% position:16%
and so this was
illuminating for me.

00:06:30.455 --> 00:06:31.690
So Trevor and I wrote a grant,

00:06:31.690 --> 00:06:33.626
and we were funded by
National Geographic

00:06:33.626 --> 00:06:36.996 align:start size:84% position:16%
to go try to capture
this environment.

00:06:36.996 --> 00:06:39.498 align:start size:88% position:13%
So with Vivek we headed
back to the field

00:06:39.498 --> 00:06:41.833 align:start size:97% position:3%
and Trevor started teaching
me some new techniques,

00:06:41.833 --> 00:06:43.836
like this camera trap set up.

00:06:43.836 --> 00:06:45.971
Where you have a DSLR,

00:06:45.971 --> 00:06:48.540 align:start size:97% position:3%
one of these big fancy
cameras with an infrared beam,

00:06:48.540 --> 00:06:50.709 align:start size:88% position:13%
and you have to
practice walking through

00:06:50.709 --> 00:06:52.745
triggering the infrared
beam to get it just right

00:06:52.745 --> 00:06:55.680
so you can get a
spectacular photo.

00:06:55.680 --> 00:06:57.183
I struggled at first initially,

00:06:57.183 --> 00:06:59.618 align:start size:84% position:16%
even with opening
the camera trap box.

00:06:59.618 --> 00:07:03.289 align:start size:97% position:3%
I think I stabbed my hand with
my Leatherman pretty good.

00:07:03.289 --> 00:07:04.924 align:start size:84% position:16%
I was worried that
was gonna get infected

00:07:04.924 --> 00:07:07.059
but it wasn't so bad.

00:07:07.059 --> 00:07:09.629
And after just setting it up,

00:07:09.629 --> 00:07:11.596 align:start size:84% position:16%
and waiting and
tweaking and tweaking,

00:07:11.596 --> 00:07:15.435
eventually we ended up
with a photo like this.

00:07:16.835 --> 00:07:20.105 align:start size:97% position:3%
Which was our camp staff
bringing their kids to work,

00:07:20.105 --> 00:07:22.774
and they knew that we set up
an automatic camera machine,

00:07:22.774 --> 00:07:24.476
and they're like oh we
can trigger this camera

00:07:24.476 --> 00:07:26.078
any time we want?

00:07:26.078 --> 00:07:27.546
This is great.

00:07:27.546 --> 00:07:29.215
So they had their kids walk
through it all the time.

00:07:29.215 --> 00:07:32.184 align:start size:84% position:16%
And then they
would borrow AK-47s

00:07:32.184 --> 00:07:33.719
from their neighbors (laughter)

00:07:33.719 --> 00:07:34.920
and pull that out,

00:07:34.920 --> 00:07:36.122 align:start size:84% position:16%
so we'll have a
couple of printouts

00:07:36.122 --> 00:07:38.023 align:start size:81% position:19%
for those guys
when we head back.

00:07:38.023 --> 00:07:40.426
But the real intention of
this is to get up close

00:07:40.426 --> 00:07:43.629
and personal with wildlife
that you couldn't otherwise.

00:07:43.629 --> 00:07:45.731 align:start size:84% position:16%
To give you a sense
of their space,

00:07:45.731 --> 00:07:47.400
and their environment.

00:07:47.400 --> 00:07:50.235 align:start position:0%
And this is the type of picture
that we were looking for.

00:07:50.235 --> 00:07:51.470
An Ethiopian wolf,

00:07:51.470 --> 00:07:54.907
the rarest canid on the
planet in the Guassa.

00:07:56.141 --> 00:07:59.445
So one day I had a
happy intersection

00:07:59.445 --> 00:08:01.413
of science and photography.

00:08:01.413 --> 00:08:02.781
I was following a wolf around,

00:08:02.781 --> 00:08:05.618 align:start size:88% position:13%
trying to see if it
would have one of these

00:08:05.618 --> 00:08:08.354
monkey-wolf interactions to
try to get a picture of it.

00:08:08.354 --> 00:08:12.290
When a saw a female walk
off from the gelada herd.

00:08:12.290 --> 00:08:13.993
And this is bizarre behavior.

00:08:13.993 --> 00:08:17.163
It sets off all sorts of alarm
bells in my biologist's brain

00:08:17.163 --> 00:08:18.664 align:start size:84% position:16%
being like
something's happening,

00:08:18.664 --> 00:08:19.665
what's going on,

00:08:19.665 --> 00:08:21.433
all right bailing on wolf.

00:08:21.433 --> 00:08:23.468
I went over and I watched her.

00:08:23.468 --> 00:08:25.036
She started arching her back,

00:08:25.036 --> 00:08:26.539
and lying down and standing up,

00:08:26.539 --> 00:08:28.474
and I realized oh my god,

00:08:28.474 --> 00:08:30.576 align:start size:84% position:16%
this monkey is
about to give birth.

00:08:30.576 --> 00:08:32.711
So I gave her her space,

00:08:32.711 --> 00:08:34.013
took my telephoto lens,

00:08:34.013 --> 00:08:35.514
I stood back and
with shaking hands

00:08:35.514 --> 00:08:37.950
captured this image sequence.

00:08:59.438 --> 00:09:02.775
So it's incredibly
rare to see a primate

00:09:03.776 --> 00:09:06.044
give birth in the wild.

00:09:06.044 --> 00:09:07.846
I was very excited
about these images

00:09:07.846 --> 00:09:09.315
for aesthetic purposes,

00:09:09.315 --> 00:09:11.717 align:start size:94% position:6%
I thought it really spoke
visually to a process

00:09:11.717 --> 00:09:14.420
that most people
don't get to see.

00:09:14.420 --> 00:09:17.056
But I also sensed that there
was great scientific value

00:09:17.056 --> 00:09:18.290
in these images,

00:09:18.290 --> 00:09:19.959
having talked to
other researchers

00:09:19.959 --> 00:09:21.727
that have worked at
this site before.

00:09:21.727 --> 00:09:24.429 align:start size:97% position:3%
So I was kind of equally
excited about what this means

00:09:24.429 --> 00:09:27.232 align:start size:84% position:16%
to kind of our
broader understanding.

00:09:27.232 --> 00:09:29.434
Over the past ten years,

00:09:29.434 --> 00:09:32.805
scientists at Guassa have
witnessed 15 live births.

00:09:32.805 --> 00:09:34.673
Which is the largest,

00:09:34.673 --> 00:09:37.843
or one of the largest
catalogs of live births

00:09:37.843 --> 00:09:40.913
in wild primates from
anywhere on the planet.

00:09:40.913 --> 00:09:44.150
We recently wrote up a paper
kind of describing this process

00:09:44.150 --> 00:09:46.986
and it's now a part of
the scientific literature

00:09:46.986 --> 00:09:51.157 align:start size:97% position:3%
looking at comparative
birth processes in primates.

00:09:55.694 --> 00:09:57.629
Vivek and I are always
trying to think of ways

00:09:57.629 --> 00:10:00.199 align:start size:94% position:6%
to combine our
photography with science.

00:10:00.199 --> 00:10:03.035
Here's another National
Geographic funded project

00:10:03.035 --> 00:10:05.571
that we came up with.

00:10:05.571 --> 00:10:08.874
It's a 3D imaging system
that allows you to capture

00:10:08.874 --> 00:10:12.811 align:start size:84% position:16%
the dimensions of
wild living primates,

00:10:12.811 --> 00:10:16.882
without having to resort
to any invasive procedures.

00:10:16.882 --> 00:10:19.085 align:start size:88% position:13%
Basically you can
reconstruct a 3D version

00:10:19.085 --> 00:10:21.553
of what you're looking at
by taking multiple pictures

00:10:21.553 --> 00:10:25.023 align:start position:0%
of the same thing from different
angles at the same time.

00:10:25.023 --> 00:10:26.625
This is one of our
earlier versions,

00:10:26.625 --> 00:10:28.860 align:start size:84% position:16%
we have a more
complex one built now.

00:10:28.860 --> 00:10:30.830
And this is an active project

00:10:30.830 --> 00:10:33.699 align:start size:88% position:13%
that we're still working
on at the moment.

00:10:33.699 --> 00:10:36.435 align:start size:94% position:6%
But we have some promising
preliminary results

00:10:36.435 --> 00:10:38.503
and we're looking
forward to taking

00:10:38.503 --> 00:10:41.306 align:start size:94% position:6%
these kind of remote
measurements of morphology

00:10:41.306 --> 00:10:44.710
and combining them with the
long term behavioral data set

00:10:44.710 --> 00:10:46.344
that we have at Guassa.

00:10:46.344 --> 00:10:48.280 align:start size:84% position:16%
It's a really
exciting intersection

00:10:48.280 --> 00:10:50.516
of photography and science.

00:10:52.685 --> 00:10:54.954 align:start size:94% position:6%
But this brings us
towards the end of our day

00:10:54.954 --> 00:10:56.788
on the high plateau.

00:10:56.788 --> 00:10:58.990
The sun is starting
to set in the west,

00:10:58.990 --> 00:11:02.327
and it casts a huge shadow
onto the Rift Valley below

00:11:02.327 --> 00:11:04.463 align:start size:81% position:19%
and the farms that
are down there.

00:11:04.463 --> 00:11:07.366
We'll walk with the
geladas back towards

00:11:07.366 --> 00:11:08.800
their sleeping cliffs,

00:11:08.800 --> 00:11:10.535
and we'll leave them there.

00:11:10.535 --> 00:11:12.504 align:start size:84% position:16%
It's a routine that
we do everyday,

00:11:12.504 --> 00:11:14.673
we'll pick them up
again in the morning.

00:11:14.673 --> 00:11:16.274 align:start size:84% position:16%
And they don't
seem to really care

00:11:16.274 --> 00:11:18.077
whether we're with them or not.

00:11:18.077 --> 00:11:20.679 align:start size:88% position:13%
They just go about
their typical business.

00:11:20.679 --> 00:11:22.381
And we can hear this happening

00:11:22.381 --> 00:11:24.716 align:start size:81% position:19%
even long after
we've walked away.

00:11:24.716 --> 00:11:27.586 align:start size:84% position:16%
Hundreds of meters
back towards our camp,

00:11:27.586 --> 00:11:31.056 align:start size:97% position:3%
you can still hear them
going about their transition

00:11:31.056 --> 00:11:32.725
from day into night.

00:11:35.594 --> 00:11:38.664
(monkeys chattering)

00:11:57.883 --> 00:12:00.619 align:start size:97% position:3%
- So tonight we've walked
you through a day in the life

00:12:00.619 --> 00:12:04.456 align:start size:84% position:16%
of a gelada and the
people who study them.

00:12:04.456 --> 00:12:06.358
We've shown you some science,

00:12:06.358 --> 00:12:08.593 align:start size:84% position:16%
and some intimate
portraits of behaviors

00:12:08.593 --> 00:12:12.431 align:start size:84% position:16%
that seem to appear
nowhere else on Earth.

00:12:12.431 --> 00:12:13.866
Over the past few years,

00:12:13.866 --> 00:12:17.336 align:start size:97% position:3%
I've grown very appreciative
of integrating science

00:12:17.336 --> 00:12:21.906
and photography together to
not only discover something,

00:12:21.906 --> 00:12:23.709
but then tell a story about it,

00:12:23.709 --> 00:12:25.511
whether it's through
data and statistics

00:12:25.511 --> 00:12:27.545
or through pictures.

00:12:27.545 --> 00:12:30.148
Jeff and I always love
returning to the Guassa.

00:12:30.148 --> 00:12:31.149
Cause in a lot of ways,

00:12:31.149 --> 00:12:32.884
everything is kind of the same.

00:12:32.884 --> 00:12:35.888
We see some of the
same individuals,

00:12:37.256 --> 00:12:40.492 align:start size:97% position:3%
the routine is more or
less the same year to year.

00:12:40.492 --> 00:12:42.227
But the Guassa is also changing.

00:12:42.227 --> 00:12:44.262
And it's changing rapidly.

00:12:44.262 --> 00:12:46.965 align:start size:84% position:16%
Today there's power
lines and roads

00:12:46.965 --> 00:12:49.301
that go through part of it.

00:12:49.301 --> 00:12:51.403
Connecting the people
living near the Guassa

00:12:51.403 --> 00:12:53.305
with the outside world.

00:12:54.707 --> 00:12:56.541 align:start size:94% position:6%
And it's not only the
landscape that's changing,

00:12:56.541 --> 00:13:00.312
but also the perceptions of
the local community members.

00:13:00.312 --> 00:13:01.980
Take Taso here.

00:13:01.980 --> 00:13:04.683 align:start size:97% position:3%
He's worked for our staff
for seven or eight years now,

00:13:04.683 --> 00:13:05.684
and the truth is,

00:13:05.684 --> 00:13:06.952
when he was a young kid,

00:13:06.952 --> 00:13:08.854
he hated geladas.

00:13:08.854 --> 00:13:11.389
They raided his crops and
he would run after them

00:13:11.389 --> 00:13:14.260
with stones and try to hit them.

00:13:14.260 --> 00:13:15.394
But over the years,

00:13:15.394 --> 00:13:16.995
his perspective has changed.

00:13:16.995 --> 00:13:19.230 align:start size:88% position:13%
He's spent a lot of
hours with the monkeys,

00:13:19.230 --> 00:13:22.668 align:start size:84% position:16%
and he's watched
their individual
personalities develop,

00:13:22.668 --> 00:13:27.406
and these bonds between mothers
and infants develop as well.

00:13:27.406 --> 00:13:30.508
And he even tells us that
now when I see monkeys,

00:13:30.508 --> 00:13:33.512
I see what makes
us human basically.

00:13:36.281 --> 00:13:39.084
We've also talked about the
factors that affect species

00:13:39.084 --> 00:13:43.155 align:start size:97% position:3%
and their ability to
persist in the 21st century.

00:13:44.590 --> 00:13:45.590
Geography,

00:13:45.590 --> 00:13:46.825
climate,

00:13:46.825 --> 00:13:50.663
and the local community
of plants and animals.

00:13:50.663 --> 00:13:53.164
And to that we can
add another element

00:13:53.164 --> 00:13:55.633
which is the human community.

00:13:55.633 --> 00:13:59.971
The Guassa has persisted for
400 years across revolutions,

00:13:59.971 --> 00:14:01.173
and famines,

00:14:01.173 --> 00:14:04.443 align:start size:88% position:13%
all because of local
engagement of the people

00:14:04.443 --> 00:14:06.578
with their land.

00:14:06.578 --> 00:14:07.946
And of course today we're facing

00:14:07.946 --> 00:14:10.015
a major conservation crisis.

00:14:10.015 --> 00:14:14.987 align:start size:97% position:3%
Humans are shaping the natural
world like never before.

00:14:14.987 --> 00:14:18.657 align:start size:97% position:3%
And a lot of these problems
have global solutions,

00:14:18.657 --> 00:14:20.326
like climate change.

00:14:21.794 --> 00:14:23.428
But for others,

00:14:23.428 --> 00:14:25.764
perhaps the Guassa
provides a lesson.

00:14:25.764 --> 00:14:27.065
I think the Guassa shows us

00:14:27.065 --> 00:14:29.334
that going into
the 21st century,

00:14:29.334 --> 00:14:33.205 align:start size:97% position:3%
local small scale conservation
has a major role to play.

00:14:33.205 --> 00:14:34.039
Thank you.
