00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
And this will be a 15 from reads 19, 23.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:10.000
The formula is we have to four quartiles, 4 times n plus three separating elements--

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
the lower quartile, the median and the upper quartile.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Any number that satisfies this formula over here has an exact definition of quartiles

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
and anything else, you just pick something in between.

00:00:20.000 --> 99:59:59.000
It really shouldn't matter much in most cases.
