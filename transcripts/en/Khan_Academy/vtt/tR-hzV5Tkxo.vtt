00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:02.870
Let's say we have some
chloroethene here, and you

00:00:02.870 --> 00:00:05.770
wouldn't have to call this
1-chloro-eth-1-ene, because if

00:00:05.770 --> 00:00:07.370
you just go with chloroethene,
there's only

00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:09.490
one way to draw this.

00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:10.710
And the common name for

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:13.880
chloroethene is vinyl chloride.

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:18.370
So let's say we have a bunch
of chloroethene molecules

00:00:18.370 --> 00:00:22.130
along with or mixed with
some hydrogen chloride.

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:24.710
And I've drawn all of the
valence electrons for the

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:27.910
chlorine atom and I've drawn a
little magenta electron, the

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:30.960
one that the hydrogen atom
brought to the table.

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.120
So we've seen something
like this before.

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:34.960
What is likely to happen?

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:37.910
Well, maybe one of these carbons
is willing to give up

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:38.630
an electron.

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:42.310
That electron goes to the
hydrogen because this electron

00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:45.450
is already being hogged by the
chlorine, so this hydrogen has

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:49.140
a partially positive charge.

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:52.280
Chlorine has a partially
negative charge, so that

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:54.810
electron would be attracted
to the hydrogen.

00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:57.330
Then this electron
can be completely

00:00:57.330 --> 00:00:59.390
hogged by the chlorine.

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:02.710
And if we had to decide which
of these carbons is more

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:05.750
likely to give up the electron,
you just have to say

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:08.910
which one is bonded to things
that it can share electrons a

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:09.580
little bit with.

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:13.890
This carbon is only bonded to
hydrogens, so it's already

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:16.590
hogging their one electron each,
and there are no more

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.150
electrons to share with it.

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:21.260
This guy is bonded to a
chlorine, so the chlorine has

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:22.410
a bunch of valence electrons.

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:26.220
It might be able share a little
bit with this carbon if

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.600
this guy became a carbocation.

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:30.680
So this guy will lose
an electron.

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:33.170
This carbon will form the
bond with that hydrogen.

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:35.420
So let's draw it out.

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:38.980
So let's say this carbon's
electron is that blue thing

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:40.580
right there.

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:41.880
Well, we could draw
it like this.

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:45.790
It goes to the hydrogen, and
then the hydrogen's magenta

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:48.560
electron goes to the chlorine.

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:51.620
This is just a plausible
mechanism.

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:55.730
Now, once that happens, what
will our setup look like?

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:59.070
What will it look like?

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:03.630
It will have this carbon over
here bonded to two hydrogens.

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:06.700
It has its single bond to that
other carbon that just lost

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:12.300
its electron, which is bonded to
a hydrogen and a chlorine.

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:14.980
And now this carbon on
the left, it is now

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:16.190
bonded to the hydrogen.

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:18.750
That electron went to the
hydrogen and it formed a bond

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:21.810
with it, so then it
forms a bond.

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:25.490
So that little blue electron is
at this end of the-- I want

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:26.710
to make it blue.

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:31.080
That little blue electron is at
this end of the bond, and

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:34.050
it is now the hydrogen's
electron.

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:38.500
And that magenta electron went
to the chlorine, so now it is

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:40.380
a negative ion.

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:41.910
It is a chloride ion.

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:44.350
So we have a chloride ion.

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:48.100
It has its standard seven
valence electrons that it

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:51.150
started off with, but now it
took that magenta electron

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:53.610
from the hydrogen,
and so now it has

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:55.110
eight valence electrons.

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:56.170
It gained an electron.

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:58.620
It now has a negative charge.

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:01.420
This guy over here
lost an electron.

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:04.300
He now has a positive charge.

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:07.000
Now, the next thing that you
might expect to happen, if we

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.220
just followed the pattern of
the last several videos, is

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:13.980
you would say, hey, this guy
will now take an electron from

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:17.940
the chlorine, which is-- or the
chloride anion, I should

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:21.860
say, which is completely
plausible, but there's also a

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:23.010
bunch of the chloroethane.

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:25.650
This isn't the only molecule
of chloroethene.

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:28.190
I should say chloroethene,
not chloroethane.

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:29.680
Chloroethene sitting around.

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:34.930
So let's let us throw another
one of those in there.

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:37.110
So we have more molecules
of this.

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:43.390
So he could take an electron
from this chloride ion, or he

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:45.920
could take an electron from
this guy over here.

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:53.360
Remember, this guy, just like
this guy, who was this guy,

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:55.260
this guy is OK.

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:58.900
It doesn't require a super
amount of energy to make this

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:00.980
guy lose his electron.

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:03.130
He's bonded to other things that
are willing to share with

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:04.030
him a little bit.

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:07.770
Maybe he's willing to lose his
electron as opposed to the

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:10.540
chloride ion.

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:13.720
So this guy has-- let me draw
it in-- so this end of this

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:15.150
bond is green.

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:19.140
And then this goes and bonds
with this carbon.

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:21.640
So this will be a long
bond right here.

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:24.830
So this goes and bonds with
that carbon, essentially

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:26.650
giving that electron
to that carbon.

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:29.340
And then what will our
setup look like?

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:32.542
So after that happens,
we'll look like this.

00:04:32.542 --> 00:04:34.940
I probably should have copied
and pasted this

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:35.900
from the get go.

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:38.950
Actually, let me do that before
I-- let me copy and

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:41.260
paste this.

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:44.820
So now let me just draw, copy
and paste this whole thing.

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:49.550
Nope, that's not what
I wanted to do.

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:52.360
Let me select it again.

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:53.560
All right.

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:55.890
Copy and then paste.

00:04:55.890 --> 00:04:56.960
There you go.

00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:59.520
So then we have that thing.

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:02.250
And let me redraw what I
had erased, so that I

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:03.910
could copy and paste.

00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:10.420
And then we have this guy went
over to this carbocation, so

00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:15.730
he's no longer a carbocation, so
let me erase this, because

00:05:15.730 --> 00:05:17.360
now he's gained an electron.

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:20.320
He gained that green electron
right there.

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:22.260
He gained that green electron.

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:23.580
I'll just draw it right there.

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:26.240
And now he's formed a bond
with this carbon.

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:29.760
And I'll make it blue, just so
we know which carbon we're

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:30.590
talking about.

00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:32.270
He's formed a bond.

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:34.800
This bond now moved over to
that carbon because the

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:35.760
electron went with it.

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:40.780
So now that bond is to this
carbon right here.

00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:44.270
That carbon right over there,
which is bonded to two

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:50.065
hydrogens, and now has a single
bond to the electron

00:05:50.065 --> 00:05:53.940
that gave up the carbon, has a
single bond to that character

00:05:53.940 --> 00:05:57.590
right over here, who is bonded
to a hydrogen and a chlorine.

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:04.960
And since he now lost an
electron, he now has a

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:06.290
positive charge.

00:06:06.290 --> 00:06:08.850
So if you look at this setup
right here, it looks very

00:06:08.850 --> 00:06:11.380
similar to this setup, although
we've added one more

00:06:11.380 --> 00:06:12.830
vinyl chloride to the mix.

00:06:12.830 --> 00:06:16.250
And the one that we added lost
its electron, or this carbon

00:06:16.250 --> 00:06:19.260
lost it electron, and now
it's a carbocation.

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:21.320
So what could happen next?

00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:25.030
Well, we have more of this vinyl
chloride sitting around.

00:06:27.820 --> 00:06:29.850
Let me draw another
vinyl chloride.

00:06:29.850 --> 00:06:35.530
So I have a carbon, a hydrogen,
a hydrogen, and then

00:06:35.530 --> 00:06:38.130
it is double bonded
to a carbon, a

00:06:38.130 --> 00:06:40.636
hydrogen, and a chlorine.

00:06:40.636 --> 00:06:42.790
And let me copy and
paste this.

00:06:42.790 --> 00:06:46.200
I think you see where this might
be going, how this could

00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:48.200
keep on going and
going and going.

00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:49.450
So copy.

00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:53.250
Well, I just copy
that for now.

00:06:53.250 --> 00:06:54.880
So what's going to happen now?

00:06:54.880 --> 00:06:58.430
This guy could go and give an
electron to this guy and form

00:06:58.430 --> 00:07:02.200
a bond, or we could have the
same process happen over and

00:07:02.200 --> 00:07:05.130
over and over again.

00:07:05.130 --> 00:07:07.760
Let me get my pen tool going.

00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:12.040
So this electron could be given
to this carbocation

00:07:12.040 --> 00:07:13.290
right there.

00:07:17.010 --> 00:07:18.840
And then what happens?

00:07:18.840 --> 00:07:21.560
Well, if that happens, then
we're going to get-- I'll move

00:07:21.560 --> 00:07:24.030
to the left now.

00:07:24.030 --> 00:07:25.470
We have our original molecule.

00:07:25.470 --> 00:07:26.970
I'm going to run out
of space soon.

00:07:26.970 --> 00:07:29.710
We have this original molecule,
and now this guy has

00:07:29.710 --> 00:07:30.490
bonded to that.

00:07:30.490 --> 00:07:37.970
So this carbon right here is
going to be this carbon, and

00:07:37.970 --> 00:07:40.610
now it is bonded to this guy.

00:07:40.610 --> 00:07:43.180
That orange electron
is now given to

00:07:43.180 --> 00:07:45.240
this guy who was positive.

00:07:45.240 --> 00:07:48.220
So he now has-- let me make
it a little bit neater.

00:07:48.220 --> 00:07:49.790
I can do a better
job than that.

00:07:49.790 --> 00:07:51.700
So the carbon's here.

00:07:51.700 --> 00:07:54.750
The bond goes to this guy.

00:07:54.750 --> 00:07:58.980
He now has the orange
electron.

00:07:58.980 --> 00:08:01.170
He no longer has a
positive charge.

00:08:03.970 --> 00:08:06.570
He's got all of his valence
electrons now.

00:08:06.570 --> 00:08:08.330
And now this guy is bonded
to two hydrogens.

00:08:11.430 --> 00:08:13.450
That guy is bonded
to two hydrogens.

00:08:13.450 --> 00:08:16.260
And he has a single bond, this
single bond right here to the

00:08:16.260 --> 00:08:18.890
carbon that just lost his
electron, who's bonded to a

00:08:18.890 --> 00:08:20.690
hydrogen and a chlorine.

00:08:20.690 --> 00:08:24.760
And because he lost his
electron, he now is the

00:08:24.760 --> 00:08:26.780
carbocation.

00:08:26.780 --> 00:08:29.050
He is now a carbocation.

00:08:29.050 --> 00:08:30.800
So I think you see where
we're going.

00:08:30.800 --> 00:08:34.780
We can just keep adding and
adding and adding to this

00:08:34.780 --> 00:08:36.745
chain of vinyl chloride.

00:08:36.745 --> 00:08:40.200
So if this process just went
on and on and on, we could

00:08:40.200 --> 00:08:41.190
make it like this.

00:08:41.190 --> 00:08:43.010
It would look something
like this.

00:08:43.010 --> 00:08:45.800
Let me see how well
I can draw it.

00:08:45.800 --> 00:08:48.160
So it would look like this.

00:08:48.160 --> 00:08:49.670
So this is a CH3.

00:08:49.670 --> 00:08:57.330
So I'll just draw it as H3C, and
then this is bonded to a

00:08:57.330 --> 00:09:02.090
carbon, that is bonded to a--
well, maybe I'll call it a CH,

00:09:02.090 --> 00:09:03.720
which is bonded to a chlorine.

00:09:03.720 --> 00:09:05.840
So we're that far
in the molecule.

00:09:05.840 --> 00:09:08.980
And then we have-- let's see
the part that repeats.

00:09:08.980 --> 00:09:15.270
This part right here is going
to keep repeating.

00:09:15.270 --> 00:09:18.850
That part right there is going
to keep repeating, and I'm

00:09:18.850 --> 00:09:20.280
going to do it like this.

00:09:20.280 --> 00:09:23.910
So I'm just going to draw one
of them, so you have a CH2.

00:09:23.910 --> 00:09:29.100
That's that right there,
connected to a CH, which is

00:09:29.100 --> 00:09:32.190
that right there, which is
connected to a chlorine.

00:09:32.190 --> 00:09:35.360
And so that part right there
will keep repeating.

00:09:35.360 --> 00:09:38.590
And then maybe the very last
one, so you have this guy

00:09:38.590 --> 00:09:41.640
right here, but maybe the very
last one that joins on-- I

00:09:41.640 --> 00:09:43.430
mean, this can happen
millions of times.

00:09:43.430 --> 00:09:45.340
I just it made it happen
two or three times.

00:09:45.340 --> 00:09:48.170
It could happen millions of
times and form a super long

00:09:48.170 --> 00:09:50.400
chain or a polymer.

00:09:50.400 --> 00:09:53.000
And what we are describing in
this video is actually a

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:55.730
polymer that you have probably
dealt with at some

00:09:55.730 --> 00:09:56.650
point in your life.

00:09:56.650 --> 00:09:58.380
In fact, I guarantee there's
some of it in

00:09:58.380 --> 00:09:59.730
your house right now.

00:09:59.730 --> 00:10:01.530
So then we'd have that
part right there.

00:10:01.530 --> 00:10:07.720
And we could just make
that as CH2, CH, Cl.

00:10:10.290 --> 00:10:12.960
And now, the way we've drawn
it, it's a carbocation, but

00:10:12.960 --> 00:10:17.530
maybe we've run out of all of
the vinyl chloride molecules,

00:10:17.530 --> 00:10:20.060
or we could also call them
chloroethene molecules.

00:10:20.060 --> 00:10:23.510
And now finally, when everything
is said and done,

00:10:23.510 --> 00:10:27.080
this last guy, since he's run
out of vinyl chloride

00:10:27.080 --> 00:10:30.790
molecules to take their
electrons from, he now finally

00:10:30.790 --> 00:10:33.160
takes it from the chlorine.

00:10:33.160 --> 00:10:36.820
So you can imagine this happens
many, many times.

00:10:36.820 --> 00:10:39.310
So this repeats many times.

00:10:39.310 --> 00:10:44.190
After this repeats many times,
then finally, one of these

00:10:44.190 --> 00:10:50.180
electrons from the chlorine go
to that final carbocation,

00:10:50.180 --> 00:10:54.220
because they've run out of other
vinyl chlorides, and

00:10:54.220 --> 00:10:58.720
then he attaches right over
here to the chlorine.

00:10:58.720 --> 00:11:02.250
Now, this is called-- so when we
say that this might happen

00:11:02.250 --> 00:11:04.630
many times, you might write an
N here, just to show that it

00:11:04.630 --> 00:11:06.000
repeats many, many times.

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:08.530
If you know how many times it
repeats, if you know that

00:11:08.530 --> 00:11:11.960
there were a thousand molecules
here, you would

00:11:11.960 --> 00:11:15.140
write a thousand repetitions,
but this is called a polymer.

00:11:17.880 --> 00:11:22.170
And the name for this molecule
right here is-- each of these

00:11:22.170 --> 00:11:23.640
units is vinyl chloride,
right?

00:11:28.530 --> 00:11:29.800
Vinyl chloride.

00:11:29.800 --> 00:11:33.170
I guess the official name is
chloroethene, but the typical

00:11:33.170 --> 00:11:36.070
name, the one people actually
to use, is vinyl chloride.

00:11:36.070 --> 00:11:37.590
That's for each of
these units.

00:11:37.590 --> 00:11:38.450
It's a polymer.

00:11:38.450 --> 00:11:41.940
We have many of them, so we'll
put a poly- in front of it.

00:11:44.450 --> 00:11:49.630
So this molecule right here is
polyvinyl chloride, or, and

00:11:49.630 --> 00:11:54.140
now I think it'll ring a
bell, or PVC for short.

00:11:54.140 --> 00:11:56.600
And you've probably heard
of PVC piping.

00:11:56.600 --> 00:11:58.610
It's what most people have
for their plumbing.

00:11:58.610 --> 00:11:59.780
It's those plastic pipes.

00:11:59.780 --> 00:12:00.820
And that's what it is.

00:12:00.820 --> 00:12:02.230
It's polyvinyl chloride.
