00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.620
 

00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:03.640
Let's think about what type of
reaction might occur if we

00:00:03.640 --> 00:00:05.990
have this molecule
right over here.

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:07.600
I won't go through the
trouble of naming it.

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:09.590
It would take up too much
time in this video.

00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:11.680
But it's dissolved
in methanol.

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:14.350
 

00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:16.110
When we talk about what type of
reactions, we're going to

00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:22.230
pick between Sn2, Sn1,
E2 and E1 reactions.

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:24.590
Now, maybe the first place to
start or the place I like to

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:26.800
start is to just look at
the solvent itself.

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:28.680
And when we're trying to decide
what type of reaction

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:31.630
will occur, the important thing
to think about is, is

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:34.370
the solvent protic or aprotic?

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:35.810
And if you look at this
solvent right

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:37.410
here, this is methanol.

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:40.420
It is protic.

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:44.150
And in case you don't remember
what protic means, it means

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:46.980
that there are protons flying
around in the solvent, that

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:49.910
they can kind of go loose and
jump around from one molecule

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:50.590
to another.

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:54.680
And the reason why I know that
methanol is protic is because

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:57.850
you have hydrogen
bonded to a very

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:01.070
electronegative atom in oxygen.

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:04.090
So every now and then, in one of
the methanol molecules, the

00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:10.840
oxygen can steal hydrogen's
electron.

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:13.150
And then the hydrogen itself,
without the electron, the

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:15.990
hydrogen proton will be flying
around because it

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:17.140
doesn't have a neutron.

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:19.970
So this is a protic solvent.

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:22.460
Now, you might say, well does
anything with a hydrogen,

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:23.280
would that be protic?

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:24.100
And the answer is no.

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:25.810
If you have a bunch of hydrogens
bonded to just

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:27.250
carbons, that is not protic.

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:29.650
Carbon is not so electronegative
that it could

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:32.190
steal a hydrogen's electron
and have the hydrogens

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:32.900
floating around.

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:35.670
So a big giveaway is hydrogen
bonded to a very

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:38.390
electronegative atom
like oxygen.

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:39.780
So this is protic.

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:42.130
And when we think about protic
out of all of the reactions we

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:49.260
studied, that favors-- well,
even a better way to think

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:50.990
about it is it disfavors.

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:59.570
So it tells us that it's
unlikely to have an Sn2 or an

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:00.730
E2 reaction.

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:04.070
And the logic there is an Sn2
reaction needs a strong

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:05.050
nucleophile.

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:08.250
An E2 reaction needs
a strong base.

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:11.720
Now, if you have protons flying
around, the nucleophile

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:15.610
or the base is likely to
react with the proton.

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:17.620
It would not be likely
to react with

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:18.960
the substrate itself.

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:22.170
So a protic solution, you're
unlikely to have an Sn2 or E2.

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:31.060
What you are likely to have is
an Sn1 or an E1 reaction.

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:33.970
Both of these need the leaving
group to leave on its own, and

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:37.150
actually, having protons around
might help to stabilize

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:39.070
the leaving group
to some degree.

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:43.060
So it makes Sn2, E2 unlikely,
Sn1, E1 a little more likely.

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:45.430
So far, these are our
good candidates.

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:47.400
Now, the next thing to think
about is to just look at the

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:50.360
leaving group itself,
or see if there is

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:51.960
even a leaving group.

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:54.805
And over here, everything we see
on this molecule is either

00:02:54.805 --> 00:03:00.070
a carbon or a hydrogen, except
for this iodine right here.

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:02.660
 

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:07.320
And we know that iodide is
a good leaving group.

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:11.580
Well, a good leaving group, it
does not make it any less

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:13.350
likely that you'd
have Sn2 or E2.

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:15.880
Both of those can do well with
a good leaving group.

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:20.080
But it's a necessary requirement
for an Sn1 or an

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:20.910
E1 reaction.

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:23.450
Remember, an Sn1 and E1, in both
of them, the first step

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:26.170
is that the leaving group
leaves on its own.

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:28.180
That is the rate-determining
step.

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:30.895
So that's a requirement
for Sn1 or E1, so

00:03:30.895 --> 00:03:32.460
it still looks likely.

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:34.320
We haven't seen anything that
would make us think that we

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:36.550
wouldn't have an Sn1 or E1.

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:37.900
This is a good leaving group.

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:38.520
Let me write it here.

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:43.740
Good leaving group.

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:47.060
Now, the last thing that we can
think about right here is

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:49.330
the carbon that we might
be leaving from.

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:52.000
So far, everything is pointing
in the Sn1 and E1 direction,

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.200
and kind of the final thing
is when this leaving group

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:57.990
leaves, it's going to form a
carbocation from the carbon

00:03:57.990 --> 00:03:59.250
that it's bonded to right now.

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:01.770
And in order for that
carbocation to be reasonably

00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:05.010
stable, at minimum it should
be a secondary carbocation

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:07.140
bonded to at least two carbons,
but ideally, it would

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:08.430
be bonded to three carbons.

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:10.470
It would be a tertiary carbon.

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:16.490
Now, the carbon that the leaving
group is bonded to is

00:04:16.490 --> 00:04:17.630
a tertiary carbon.

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:21.399
It's bonded to one, two,
three carbons.

00:04:21.399 --> 00:04:25.110
so it is a tertiary carbon.

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:28.240
It can actually be a
stable carbocation.

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:30.820
It's a tertiary carbon,
which it once again

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:32.440
favors Sn1 and E1.

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:34.950
So all of the clues here
tell us that Sn1 and E1

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:35.970
are going to happen.

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:37.520
And actually, they'll
both happen.

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:41.190
So let's think about
the mechanism.

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:44.010
In the very first step, the
leaving group leaves in either

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:45.420
one of these reactions.

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:47.800
So if we look at the iodine,
it already has

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:49.080
seven valence electrons.

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:54.410
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven.

00:04:54.410 --> 00:04:57.250
And in the first step, the
rate-determining step of the

00:04:57.250 --> 00:05:02.440
Sn1 or E1 reaction, the iodine's
going to nab an

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:03.510
electron off the carbon.

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:08.060
I'll do that electron in
green right over there.

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:12.200
That's going to get nabbed onto
iodine to make iodide,

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:14.390
and then that carbon is going to
lose an electron and become

00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:15.570
a carbocation.

00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:17.790
So after that very first
step, we have something

00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:19.460
that looks like this.

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:21.760
So that's our molecule.

00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:24.070
Just so it's clear what we did,
this arrow I'll do all

00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:26.750
the way over here, so
it's clear that

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:29.320
this is our next step.

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:30.740
And what's happened here?

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:34.730
Our tertiary carbon has
lost its electron.

00:05:34.730 --> 00:05:38.520
So now this carbon right here
has a positive charge.

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:41.190
It's a tertiary carbocation.

00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:43.610
And now the iodine has
become iodide.

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:47.430
It has left the molecule.

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:51.420
So it had its original seven
valence electrons: one, two,

00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:54.200
three, four, five, six, seven.

00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:58.250
It nabbed one more electron
from the carbon and now it

00:05:58.250 --> 00:06:00.880
is-- I wanted to do
that in green.

00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:05.080
It nabbed one more electron from
the carbon, now it is the

00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:10.550
iodide anion.

00:06:10.550 --> 00:06:12.510
So this step right
here is common to

00:06:12.510 --> 00:06:14.940
both Sn1 and E1 reaction.

00:06:14.940 --> 00:06:17.250
The leaving group
has to leave.

00:06:17.250 --> 00:06:20.170
Now, after this, they
start to diverge.

00:06:20.170 --> 00:06:23.520
In an Sn1, the leaving group
essentially gets substituted

00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:25.620
with a weak nucleophile.

00:06:25.620 --> 00:06:29.250
In an E1, a weak base strips off
one of the beta hydrogens

00:06:29.250 --> 00:06:30.420
and forms an alkene.

00:06:30.420 --> 00:06:33.850
So let's do them separately.

00:06:33.850 --> 00:06:35.220
So over here, I'm going
to do the Sn1.

00:06:35.220 --> 00:06:38.120
 

00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:43.280
And on the right-hand side,
I will do the E1 reaction.

00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:46.250
So let me start over here.

00:06:46.250 --> 00:06:49.180
So the Sn1 is starting over
here at this step.

00:06:49.180 --> 00:06:51.290
I'll just redo this
step over here.

00:06:51.290 --> 00:06:53.980
So this has a positive charge.

00:06:53.980 --> 00:06:55.390
That has a positive
charge here.

00:06:55.390 --> 00:06:59.290
The iodide has left.

00:06:59.290 --> 00:07:01.960
I don't have to draw all its
valence electrons anymore.

00:07:01.960 --> 00:07:03.520
And what's going
to happen next?

00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:05.380
We're going to get substituted
with the weak base, and the

00:07:05.380 --> 00:07:08.440
weak base here is actually
the methanol.

00:07:08.440 --> 00:07:10.320
The weak base here
is the methanol.

00:07:10.320 --> 00:07:12.190
So let me draw some
methanol here.

00:07:12.190 --> 00:07:17.770
 

00:07:17.770 --> 00:07:22.810
It's got two unbonded pairs of
electrons and one of them,

00:07:22.810 --> 00:07:24.000
it's a weak base.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.400
It was willing to give
an electron.

00:07:26.400 --> 00:07:29.460
It has a partial negative
charge over here because

00:07:29.460 --> 00:07:31.280
oxygen is electronegative, but
it doesn't have a full

00:07:31.280 --> 00:07:33.460
negative charge, so it's not
a strong nucleophile.

00:07:33.460 --> 00:07:36.500
But it can donate an electron
to this carbocation, and

00:07:36.500 --> 00:07:38.480
that's what is going
to happen.

00:07:38.480 --> 00:07:42.210
It will donate an electron
to this carbocation.

00:07:42.210 --> 00:07:48.420
And then after that happens,
it will look like this.

00:07:48.420 --> 00:07:51.690
That's our original molecule.

00:07:51.690 --> 00:07:55.100
Now this magenta electron
has been donated to the

00:07:55.100 --> 00:07:56.370
carbocation.

00:07:56.370 --> 00:08:00.090
The other end of it is this blue
electron right here on

00:08:00.090 --> 00:08:01.080
the oxygen.

00:08:01.080 --> 00:08:02.770
It is now bonded.

00:08:02.770 --> 00:08:03.880
That is our oxygen.

00:08:03.880 --> 00:08:07.570
Here's that other pair of
electrons on that oxygen, and

00:08:07.570 --> 00:08:13.130
it is bonded to a hydrogen
and a methyl group.

00:08:13.130 --> 00:08:15.930
And then the last step of this
is another weak base might be

00:08:15.930 --> 00:08:19.150
able to come and nab off the
hydrogen proton right there.

00:08:19.150 --> 00:08:21.230
Oh, I want to be very
clear here.

00:08:21.230 --> 00:08:22.670
The oxygen was neutral.

00:08:22.670 --> 00:08:24.100
The methanol here is neutral.

00:08:24.100 --> 00:08:28.040
It is giving away an electron
to the carbocation.

00:08:28.040 --> 00:08:30.750
The carbocation had a positive
charge because it had lost it

00:08:30.750 --> 00:08:31.320
originally.

00:08:31.320 --> 00:08:32.450
Now it gets an electron back.

00:08:32.450 --> 00:08:33.990
It becomes neutral.

00:08:33.990 --> 00:08:37.230
The methanol, on the other hand,
was neutral, gives away

00:08:37.230 --> 00:08:42.210
an electron, so now it becomes--
it now is positive.

00:08:42.210 --> 00:08:45.040
So now you might have
another methanol.

00:08:45.040 --> 00:08:47.810
You might have another methanol
molecule sitting out

00:08:47.810 --> 00:08:54.570
here someplace that might also
nab the proton off of this

00:08:54.570 --> 00:08:56.520
positive ion.

00:08:56.520 --> 00:08:59.090
So this one right here,
it would nab it or it

00:08:59.090 --> 00:08:59.860
would bond with it.

00:08:59.860 --> 00:09:03.850
It would give the electron to
the hydrogen proton, really.

00:09:03.850 --> 00:09:08.110
The hydrogen's electron gets
nabbed by the oxygen, and so

00:09:08.110 --> 00:09:10.570
then that becomes neutral.

00:09:10.570 --> 00:09:14.920
So in the final step, it'll
all look like this.

00:09:14.920 --> 00:09:16.370
We have that over here.

00:09:16.370 --> 00:09:19.530
The methanol that had originally
bonded has lost its

00:09:19.530 --> 00:09:21.890
hydrogen, so it looks
like this.

00:09:21.890 --> 00:09:27.140
We just have the oxygen
and the CH3 there.

00:09:27.140 --> 00:09:30.830
It is now neutral because it
gained an electron when that

00:09:30.830 --> 00:09:32.920
hydrogen proton was nabbed.

00:09:32.920 --> 00:09:34.540
So if you wanted to draw it,
it has actually those two

00:09:34.540 --> 00:09:36.980
extra electrons,
just like that.

00:09:36.980 --> 00:09:39.100
And if you want to draw this
last methanol, it's now a

00:09:39.100 --> 00:09:42.080
positive cation, so it
looks like this.

00:09:42.080 --> 00:09:49.530
So it's OH, CH3, H, and then
it has unbonded pair right

00:09:49.530 --> 00:09:51.910
there, and now this has
a positive charge.

00:09:51.910 --> 00:09:54.120
So that was the Sn1 reaction.

00:09:54.120 --> 00:09:56.310
Now, the other reaction that's
going to occur is the E1.

00:09:56.310 --> 00:09:58.850
 

00:09:58.850 --> 00:10:02.365
Once again, our first
step-- nope, I

00:10:02.365 --> 00:10:03.450
didn't want to do that.

00:10:03.450 --> 00:10:06.780
Our first step looks
like that.

00:10:06.780 --> 00:10:08.220
So that is our first step.

00:10:08.220 --> 00:10:09.390
Let me get everything
straight.

00:10:09.390 --> 00:10:11.550
So the leaving group had left.

00:10:11.550 --> 00:10:14.580
So in each situation, the
leaving group had left.

00:10:14.580 --> 00:10:15.990
Our iodide is up here.

00:10:15.990 --> 00:10:19.010
 

00:10:19.010 --> 00:10:22.510
And in an E1 reaction, you
don't get substituted.

00:10:22.510 --> 00:10:26.120
What happens is one of the beta
carbons gets a hydrogen

00:10:26.120 --> 00:10:28.320
swiped off of it
by a weak base.

00:10:28.320 --> 00:10:30.410
Now, let's think about what
a beta carbon is.

00:10:30.410 --> 00:10:33.250
The alpha carbon is the
carbocation carbon.

00:10:33.250 --> 00:10:34.130
That's right over there.

00:10:34.130 --> 00:10:35.480
That's the alpha carbon.

00:10:35.480 --> 00:10:37.150
Beta carbons are one
carbon away.

00:10:37.150 --> 00:10:40.750
So this is a beta carbon, this
is a beta carbon, and then

00:10:40.750 --> 00:10:42.410
that is a beta carbon.

00:10:42.410 --> 00:10:44.930
Now, this carbon over here is
not bonded to any hydrogens.

00:10:44.930 --> 00:10:46.470
It's only bonded to
other carbons.

00:10:46.470 --> 00:10:49.280
So that one cannot lose
any hydrogens.

00:10:49.280 --> 00:10:51.180
And then we have to pick between
this carbon that's

00:10:51.180 --> 00:10:54.030
bonded to three hydrogens and
this carbon that's actually

00:10:54.030 --> 00:10:55.050
bonded to two hydrogens.

00:10:55.050 --> 00:10:57.530
I didn't draw it before, but
it's implicitly there.

00:10:57.530 --> 00:10:58.960
It's bonded to two hydrogens.

00:10:58.960 --> 00:11:03.860
Now Zaitsev's rule tells us that
the dominating product is

00:11:03.860 --> 00:11:07.390
going to be produced when the
carbon that has less hydrogens

00:11:07.390 --> 00:11:08.400
loses a hydrogen.

00:11:08.400 --> 00:11:10.820
So out of this, this carbon
has two hydrogens,

00:11:10.820 --> 00:11:12.030
this one has three.

00:11:12.030 --> 00:11:14.300
So the one that's going to lose
the hydrogen to the base,

00:11:14.300 --> 00:11:16.440
or more likely to lose the
hydrogen to the base, is the

00:11:16.440 --> 00:11:18.870
one that has two hydrogens, not

00:11:18.870 --> 00:11:20.670
three, the fewer hydrogens.

00:11:20.670 --> 00:11:23.520
So our base in this case is once
again the methanol, acted

00:11:23.520 --> 00:11:26.900
as a nucleophile in the
Sn1, acted as a weak

00:11:26.900 --> 00:11:28.350
nucleophile in Sn1.

00:11:28.350 --> 00:11:30.700
Now it'll act as a weak base.

00:11:30.700 --> 00:11:35.090
So we have methanol
right over here.

00:11:35.090 --> 00:11:36.480
That's a hydrogen.

00:11:36.480 --> 00:11:40.280
CH3 has some electrons
right over here.

00:11:40.280 --> 00:11:42.330
It has a partial negative
charge.

00:11:42.330 --> 00:11:47.440
It will give one of the
electrons to the hydrogen,

00:11:47.440 --> 00:11:49.030
just to the hydrogen proton.

00:11:49.030 --> 00:11:51.250
The hydrogen's not going to
take its electron with it.

00:11:51.250 --> 00:11:57.770
That electron is then going to
be given to the carbocation to

00:11:57.770 --> 00:12:00.750
make it neutral, and it will
form a double bond.

00:12:00.750 --> 00:12:03.060
So after that happens, we
are left with something

00:12:03.060 --> 00:12:04.070
that looks like this.

00:12:04.070 --> 00:12:05.820
This was our original
molecule.

00:12:05.820 --> 00:12:13.010
Now, this carbon right
here in yellow, it

00:12:13.010 --> 00:12:14.090
has lost its hydrogen.

00:12:14.090 --> 00:12:15.760
This hydrogen back here
is still there.

00:12:15.760 --> 00:12:16.960
I could draw it if I like.

00:12:16.960 --> 00:12:17.480
I don't need to.

00:12:17.480 --> 00:12:19.070
It just makes the thing messy.

00:12:19.070 --> 00:12:21.930
But it has now formed a double
bond with the primary carbon.

00:12:21.930 --> 00:12:24.040
It has now formed
a double bond.

00:12:24.040 --> 00:12:28.190
That electron that had bonded
with the hydrogen was now

00:12:28.190 --> 00:12:29.820
given to the carbocation.

00:12:29.820 --> 00:12:31.520
It has a double bond
with that.

00:12:31.520 --> 00:12:36.880
And then you have your methanol
has now turned into a

00:12:36.880 --> 00:12:38.710
positive ion.

00:12:38.710 --> 00:12:43.810
It has now turned into
a positive ion: CH3.

00:12:43.810 --> 00:12:46.390
And now it has this bond.

00:12:46.390 --> 00:12:49.020
It has this bond with
the hydrogen.

00:12:49.020 --> 00:12:52.520
I'll even make that electron
that it gave away in magenta.

00:12:52.520 --> 00:12:58.150
And then it has that extra
lone pair of electrons.

00:12:58.150 --> 00:13:00.660
So, in this circumstance, we
looked at all of the clues.

00:13:00.660 --> 00:13:03.330
All of the clues were
against Sn2 and E2.

00:13:03.330 --> 00:13:04.860
They favored Sn1 and E1.

00:13:04.860 --> 00:13:07.080
So if you were to actually
make this, if you were to

00:13:07.080 --> 00:13:09.830
actually try to see what happens
is this reaction, you

00:13:09.830 --> 00:13:13.900
would get products of both Sn1
and E1 reactions, these

00:13:13.900 --> 00:13:17.270
products and these products
over here.
