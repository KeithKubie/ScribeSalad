00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:39.800
question on moderator and that is
 

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:43.280
question on moderator and that is
gentlemen should your app store all data

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290
gentlemen should your app store all data
 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:47.180
gentlemen should your app store all data
that's not sensible in / SD card as /

the Galaxy Nexus ends up in / data / and
 

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:58.250
the Galaxy Nexus ends up in / data / and
personally I prefer / data what's the

personally I prefer / data what's the
 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.500

best way to handle this I'm a little

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510
best way to handle this I'm a little
 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:03.529
best way to handle this I'm a little
confused about what he means by / data

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539
confused about what he means by / data
 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:06.500
confused about what he means by / data
versus / data / because that's the same

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510
versus / data / because that's the same
 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:10.460
versus / data / because that's the same
path I'm wondering if what he means is

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470
path I'm wondering if what he means is
 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:15.590
path I'm wondering if what he means is
that information stored on / SD card on

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600
that information stored on / SD card on
 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:19.190
that information stored on / SD card on
Galaxy Nexus is still stored somewhere

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200
Galaxy Nexus is still stored somewhere
 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:22.010
Galaxy Nexus is still stored somewhere
inside of / data because the device

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020
inside of / data because the device
 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:25.399
inside of / data because the device
doesn't have a external SD card right so

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409
doesn't have a external SD card right so
 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:27.710
doesn't have a external SD card right so
i'm not sure where else you put the data

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720
i'm not sure where else you put the data
 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:30.499
i'm not sure where else you put the data
in that case is i assume what he means

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509
in that case is i assume what he means
 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:33.050
in that case is i assume what he means
in this case is SS watch SD card /

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060
in this case is SS watch SD card /
 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.330
in this case is SS watch SD card /
android / data that's the only and it's

actually words can end up getting record

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579
actually words can end up getting record
 

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:40.999
actually words can end up getting record
and even its they like the only real

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009
and even its they like the only real
 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:43.999
and even its they like the only real
differences on Galaxy Nexus is one of

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009
differences on Galaxy Nexus is one of
 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:47.359
differences on Galaxy Nexus is one of
them has a case depend I'll system one

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369
them has a case depend I'll system one
 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:50.389
them has a case depend I'll system one
doesn't two and one of them is of course

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399
doesn't two and one of them is of course
 

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:51.330
doesn't two and one of them is of course
excess

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:51.340
excess
 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:53.849
excess
other applications so I and you know and

00:01:53.849 --> 00:01:53.859
other applications so I and you know and
 

00:01:53.859 --> 00:01:56.940
other applications so I and you know and
I think that if it's sensitive data as a

00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:56.950
I think that if it's sensitive data as a
 

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:00.690
I think that if it's sensitive data as a
general rule you want to avoid storing

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:00.700
general rule you want to avoid storing
 

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:03.090
general rule you want to avoid storing
it on the SD card if you're starting a

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:03.100
it on the SD card if you're starting a
 

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:05.580
it on the SD card if you're starting a
lot of data you know the SD card is

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:05.590
lot of data you know the SD card is
 

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:07.649
lot of data you know the SD card is
safer and then the real question is how

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:07.659
safer and then the real question is how
 

00:02:07.659 --> 00:02:09.150
safer and then the real question is how
do you detect the device like galaxy

00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:09.160
do you detect the device like galaxy
 

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:11.789
do you detect the device like galaxy
access which is using continuous storage

00:02:11.789 --> 00:02:11.799
access which is using continuous storage
 

00:02:11.799 --> 00:02:15.210
access which is using continuous storage
both and is that it that is kind of an

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:15.220
both and is that it that is kind of an
 

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:16.800
both and is that it that is kind of an
interesting question you know it's a

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:16.810
interesting question you know it's a
 

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:20.630
interesting question you know it's a
general rule you know we don't really

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:20.640
general rule you know we don't really
 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:22.890
general rule you know we don't really
suggest actually using a different

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:22.900
suggest actually using a different
 

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:24.479
suggest actually using a different
approach based upon the different

00:02:24.479 --> 00:02:24.489
approach based upon the different
 

00:02:24.489 --> 00:02:26.400
approach based upon the different
devices but you know the goal you know

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:26.410
devices but you know the goal you know
 

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:27.930
devices but you know the goal you know
going going forward it's really really

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:27.940
going going forward it's really really
 

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:30.839
going going forward it's really really
nice to have devices where it's all one

00:02:30.839 --> 00:02:30.849
nice to have devices where it's all one
 

00:02:30.849 --> 00:02:33.240
nice to have devices where it's all one
file system like Galaxy Nexus you don't

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:33.250
file system like Galaxy Nexus you don't
 

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:35.339
file system like Galaxy Nexus you don't
have to actually worry about this and

00:02:35.339 --> 00:02:35.349
have to actually worry about this and
 

00:02:35.349 --> 00:02:37.319
have to actually worry about this and
it's kind of a nice benefit of the

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:37.329
it's kind of a nice benefit of the
 

00:02:37.329 --> 00:02:41.190
it's kind of a nice benefit of the
design again any any comments on on best

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:41.200
design again any any comments on on best
 

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:42.509
design again any any comments on on best
practice around that trevor is our way

00:02:42.509 --> 00:02:42.519
practice around that trevor is our way
 

00:02:42.519 --> 00:02:44.000
practice around that trevor is our way
to detect whether or not you have a

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:44.010
to detect whether or not you have a
 

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:46.530
to detect whether or not you have a
single file system or multiple yeah well

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:46.540
single file system or multiple yeah well
 

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:49.080
single file system or multiple yeah well
you can check the external storage state

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:49.090
you can check the external storage state
 

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:50.160
you can check the external storage state
which should tell you without there's

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:50.170
which should tell you without there's
 

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:52.319
which should tell you without there's
actually an SD card mounted or available

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:52.329
actually an SD card mounted or available
 

00:02:52.329 --> 00:02:55.710
actually an SD card mounted or available
um that being said I usually you know I

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:55.720
um that being said I usually you know I
 

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:57.449
um that being said I usually you know I
think the rules just look at what type

00:02:57.449 --> 00:02:57.459
think the rules just look at what type
 

00:02:57.459 --> 00:02:58.920
think the rules just look at what type
of data it is like Dan said if it's

00:02:58.920 --> 00:02:58.930
of data it is like Dan said if it's
 

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:01.710
of data it is like Dan said if it's
something that's small and or sensitive

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:01.720
something that's small and or sensitive
 

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:03.539
something that's small and or sensitive
it's usually best to place it inside of

00:03:03.539 --> 00:03:03.549
it's usually best to place it inside of
 

00:03:03.549 --> 00:03:07.949
it's usually best to place it inside of
yo in the apps private near tree within

00:03:07.949 --> 00:03:07.959
yo in the apps private near tree within
 

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:11.910
yo in the apps private near tree within
/ data if its large and or publicly or

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:11.920
/ data if its large and or publicly or
 

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:13.710
/ data if its large and or publicly or
should be publicly accessible then you

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:13.720
should be publicly accessible then you
 

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:15.539
should be publicly accessible then you
should put it on the SD card regardless

00:03:15.539 --> 00:03:15.549
should put it on the SD card regardless
 

00:03:15.549 --> 00:03:16.830
should put it on the SD card regardless
of whether or not that's a real SD card

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:16.840
of whether or not that's a real SD card
 

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:19.680
of whether or not that's a real SD card
or not and then really the only other

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:19.690
or not and then really the only other
 

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:22.199
or not and then really the only other
thing you have to watch out for is the

00:03:22.199 --> 00:03:22.209
thing you have to watch out for is the
 

00:03:22.209 --> 00:03:23.370
thing you have to watch out for is the
case where there's not an SD card

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:23.380
case where there's not an SD card
 

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:25.229
case where there's not an SD card
present so you know a device that uses

00:03:25.229 --> 00:03:25.239
present so you know a device that uses
 

00:03:25.239 --> 00:03:26.759
present so you know a device that uses
external storage but the users remove

00:03:26.759 --> 00:03:26.769
external storage but the users remove
 

00:03:26.769 --> 00:03:28.949
external storage but the users remove
the SD card in which case you really

00:03:28.949 --> 00:03:28.959
the SD card in which case you really
 

00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:31.259
the SD card in which case you really
only have one choice which is internal

00:03:31.259 --> 00:03:31.269
only have one choice which is internal
 

00:03:31.269 --> 00:03:33.990
only have one choice which is internal
storage or I suppose you could refuse to

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:34.000
storage or I suppose you could refuse to
 

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.360
storage or I suppose you could refuse to
run but let's let's avoid that that

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:36.370
run but let's let's avoid that that
 

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:39.210
run but let's let's avoid that that
possibility normally you want your actor

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:39.220
possibility normally you want your actor
 

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:41.909
possibility normally you want your actor
on but yeah I think just looking at the

00:03:41.909 --> 00:03:41.919
on but yeah I think just looking at the
 

00:03:41.919 --> 00:03:43.530
on but yeah I think just looking at the
use case were what type of data you're

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:43.540
use case were what type of data you're
 

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:45.180
use case were what type of data you're
storing will dictate where you store it

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:45.190
storing will dictate where you store it
 

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:47.220
storing will dictate where you store it
and regardless of where the notice

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:47.230
and regardless of where the notice
 

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:48.750
and regardless of where the notice
actually a real SD card or not shouldn't

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:48.760
actually a real SD card or not shouldn't
 

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:50.849
actually a real SD card or not shouldn't
make a difference yeah that's the real

00:03:50.849 --> 00:03:50.859
make a difference yeah that's the real
 

00:03:50.859 --> 00:03:52.650
make a difference yeah that's the real
question is the word is in the in the

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:52.660
question is the word is in the in the
 

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:54.309
question is the word is in the in the
question is sensible

00:03:54.309 --> 00:03:54.319
question is sensible
 

00:03:54.319 --> 00:03:56.619
question is sensible
and I am NOT for a measure we need I

00:03:56.619 --> 00:03:56.629
and I am NOT for a measure we need I
 

00:03:56.629 --> 00:03:59.559
and I am NOT for a measure we need I
think he means sensitive there I don't

00:03:59.559 --> 00:03:59.569
think he means sensitive there I don't
 

00:03:59.569 --> 00:04:00.550
think he means sensitive there I don't
know if that's what I thought I was

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:00.560
know if that's what I thought I was
 

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:02.110
know if that's what I thought I was
always a bit sensible in terms of in

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:02.120
always a bit sensible in terms of in
 

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:04.149
always a bit sensible in terms of in
terms of large data you know it would

00:04:04.149 --> 00:04:04.159
terms of large data you know it would
 

00:04:04.159 --> 00:04:05.860
terms of large data you know it would
make sense so you know large data you

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:05.870
make sense so you know large data you
 

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:07.059
make sense so you know large data you
know generally you want to put on the SD

00:04:07.059 --> 00:04:07.069
know generally you want to put on the SD
 

00:04:07.069 --> 00:04:08.830
know generally you want to put on the SD
card sensitive you know data you want to

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:08.840
card sensitive you know data you want to
 

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:12.250
card sensitive you know data you want to
put on in the data space so i guess

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:12.260
put on in the data space so i guess
 

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:13.449
put on in the data space so i guess
that's that's the best we can do there

00:04:13.449 --> 00:04:13.459
that's that's the best we can do there
 

00:04:13.459 --> 00:04:16.599
that's that's the best we can do there
it's a city so I Galaxy Nexus that will

00:04:16.599 --> 00:04:16.609
it's a city so I Galaxy Nexus that will
 

00:04:16.609 --> 00:04:18.400
it's a city so I Galaxy Nexus that will
it always show up as an SD card mounted

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:18.410
it always show up as an SD card mounted
 

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:19.629
it always show up as an SD card mounted
or will never show up as an SD card

00:04:19.629 --> 00:04:19.639
or will never show up as an SD card
 

00:04:19.639 --> 00:04:21.339
or will never show up as an SD card
mounted well that's a good question i

00:04:21.339 --> 00:04:21.349
mounted well that's a good question i
 

00:04:21.349 --> 00:04:23.230
mounted well that's a good question i
want to say they'll show up as mounted

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:23.240
want to say they'll show up as mounted
 

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:24.790
want to say they'll show up as mounted
because that way that that's how you

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:24.800
because that way that that's how you
 

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:26.320
because that way that that's how you
determine whether or not you can

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:26.330
determine whether or not you can
 

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:27.879
determine whether or not you can
actually even attempt to write so it

00:04:27.879 --> 00:04:27.889
actually even attempt to write so it
 

00:04:27.889 --> 00:04:29.860
actually even attempt to write so it
should show up as always mounted right

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:29.870
should show up as always mounted right
 

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:32.230
should show up as always mounted right
right that's what I thought ok yeah now

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:32.240
right that's what I thought ok yeah now
 

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:33.820
right that's what I thought ok yeah now
that you do not select a watch out that

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:33.830
that you do not select a watch out that
 

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:36.249
that you do not select a watch out that
if the user is using an older device

00:04:36.249 --> 00:04:36.259
if the user is using an older device
 

00:04:36.259 --> 00:04:39.460
if the user is using an older device
that uses a fat file system for external

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:39.470
that uses a fat file system for external
 

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:41.409
that uses a fat file system for external
storage in other words it's using an SD

00:04:41.409 --> 00:04:41.419
storage in other words it's using an SD
 

00:04:41.419 --> 00:04:43.540
storage in other words it's using an SD
card when the user connects the device

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:43.550
card when the user connects the device
 

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:45.249
card when the user connects the device
to the computer and turns on USB storage

00:04:45.249 --> 00:04:45.259
to the computer and turns on USB storage
 

00:04:45.259 --> 00:04:47.200
to the computer and turns on USB storage
even though the SD card is still

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:47.210
even though the SD card is still
 

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:50.290
even though the SD card is still
attached it'll become unmounted as far

00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:50.300
attached it'll become unmounted as far
 

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:52.029
attached it'll become unmounted as far
as your application is concerned so it

00:04:52.029 --> 00:04:52.039
as your application is concerned so it
 

00:04:52.039 --> 00:04:54.010
as your application is concerned so it
is possible for the SD card to disappear

00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:54.020
is possible for the SD card to disappear
 

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:55.719
is possible for the SD card to disappear
even one is inserted in the device and

00:04:55.719 --> 00:04:55.729
even one is inserted in the device and
 

00:04:55.729 --> 00:04:58.300
even one is inserted in the device and
so on all over the vices it is it is a

00:04:58.300 --> 00:04:58.310
so on all over the vices it is it is a
 

00:04:58.310 --> 00:04:59.830
so on all over the vices it is it is a
lot more calm than I think a lot of a

00:04:59.830 --> 00:04:59.840
lot more calm than I think a lot of a
 

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:01.120
lot more calm than I think a lot of a
lot of developers realized yeah and if

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:01.130
lot of developers realized yeah and if
 

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:03.040
lot of developers realized yeah and if
you actually have a filehandle open on

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:03.050
you actually have a filehandle open on
 

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:05.080
you actually have a filehandle open on
that SD card evil android will

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:05.090
that SD card evil android will
 

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:07.060
that SD card evil android will
immediately terminate your application

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:07.070
immediately terminate your application
 

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:10.330
immediately terminate your application
so it went when the SD card of unmounted

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:10.340
so it went when the SD card of unmounted
 

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:12.370
so it went when the SD card of unmounted
together the others the other side of

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:12.380
together the others the other side of
 

00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:14.439
together the others the other side of
using it

00:05:14.439 --> 00:05:14.449
using it
 

00:05:14.449 --> 00:05:19.059
using it
okay thank you gentlemen our next

00:05:19.059 --> 00:05:19.069
okay thank you gentlemen our next
 

00:05:19.069 --> 00:05:21.850
okay thank you gentlemen our next
question is my activity has a spinner in

00:05:21.850 --> 00:05:21.860
question is my activity has a spinner in
 

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:24.610
question is my activity has a spinner in
the action bar each item corresponds to

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:24.620
the action bar each item corresponds to
 

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:27.010
the action bar each item corresponds to
a fragment a use case where if I select

00:05:27.010 --> 00:05:27.020
a fragment a use case where if I select
 

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:28.869
a fragment a use case where if I select
an item from one fragment I have to

00:05:28.869 --> 00:05:28.879
an item from one fragment I have to
 

00:05:28.879 --> 00:05:30.249
an item from one fragment I have to
replace the current fragment with

00:05:30.249 --> 00:05:30.259
replace the current fragment with
 

00:05:30.259 --> 00:05:32.320
replace the current fragment with
another fragment how do I manage the

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:32.330
another fragment how do I manage the
 

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:37.420
another fragment how do I manage the
back stack okay so i'm not sure if it

00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:37.430
back stack okay so i'm not sure if it
 

00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:38.619
back stack okay so i'm not sure if it
really even matters whether or not

00:05:38.619 --> 00:05:38.629
really even matters whether or not
 

00:05:38.629 --> 00:05:39.700
really even matters whether or not
there's our fragment there or not i

00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:39.710
there's our fragment there or not i
 

00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:41.980
there's our fragment there or not i
think the big question is here is what

00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:41.990
think the big question is here is what
 

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:46.299
think the big question is here is what
was the correct user experience and when

00:05:46.299 --> 00:05:46.309
was the correct user experience and when
 

00:05:46.309 --> 00:05:47.769
was the correct user experience and when
it comes to something like a spinner on

00:05:47.769 --> 00:05:47.779
it comes to something like a spinner on
 

00:05:47.779 --> 00:05:49.899
it comes to something like a spinner on
the action bar I like to think of this

00:05:49.899 --> 00:05:49.909
the action bar I like to think of this
 

00:05:49.909 --> 00:05:52.929
the action bar I like to think of this
is similar to tabs the top and if you

00:05:52.929 --> 00:05:52.939
is similar to tabs the top and if you
 

00:05:52.939 --> 00:05:54.219
is similar to tabs the top and if you
look at pretty much every system

00:05:54.219 --> 00:05:54.229
look at pretty much every system
 

00:05:54.229 --> 00:05:56.619
look at pretty much every system
application that uses tabs when you

00:05:56.619 --> 00:05:56.629
application that uses tabs when you
 

00:05:56.629 --> 00:05:58.779
application that uses tabs when you
switch tabs back doesn't take you back

00:05:58.779 --> 00:05:58.789
switch tabs back doesn't take you back
 

00:05:58.789 --> 00:06:01.480
switch tabs back doesn't take you back
to the old tab it'll take you back to

00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:01.490
to the old tab it'll take you back to
 

00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:03.670
to the old tab it'll take you back to
the previous activity which you know in

00:06:03.670 --> 00:06:03.680
the previous activity which you know in
 

00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:05.290
the previous activity which you know in
many cases means just right out of your

00:06:05.290 --> 00:06:05.300
many cases means just right out of your
 

00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:06.519
many cases means just right out of your
application assuming this is your home

00:06:06.519 --> 00:06:06.529
application assuming this is your home
 

00:06:06.529 --> 00:06:09.939
application assuming this is your home
screen and so I think with a spinner the

00:06:09.939 --> 00:06:09.949
screen and so I think with a spinner the
 

00:06:09.949 --> 00:06:11.860
screen and so I think with a spinner the
paper should be the same so when you

00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:11.870
paper should be the same so when you
 

00:06:11.870 --> 00:06:14.409
paper should be the same so when you
switch tabs don't change what's in your

00:06:14.409 --> 00:06:14.419
switch tabs don't change what's in your
 

00:06:14.419 --> 00:06:16.629
switch tabs don't change what's in your
back stack and for those of you who

00:06:16.629 --> 00:06:16.639
back stack and for those of you who
 

00:06:16.639 --> 00:06:17.499
back stack and for those of you who
don't have a lot of experience with

00:06:17.499 --> 00:06:17.509
don't have a lot of experience with
 

00:06:17.509 --> 00:06:19.629
don't have a lot of experience with
fragments whenever you do a fragment

00:06:19.629 --> 00:06:19.639
fragments whenever you do a fragment
 

00:06:19.639 --> 00:06:21.879
fragments whenever you do a fragment
transition is up to the developer to

00:06:21.879 --> 00:06:21.889
transition is up to the developer to
 

00:06:21.889 --> 00:06:23.920
transition is up to the developer to
determine at what the new state of the

00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:23.930
determine at what the new state of the
 

00:06:23.930 --> 00:06:26.499
determine at what the new state of the
back stack should be so in this case it

00:06:26.499 --> 00:06:26.509
back stack should be so in this case it
 

00:06:26.509 --> 00:06:27.879
back stack should be so in this case it
would just be as simple as not doing

00:06:27.879 --> 00:06:27.889
would just be as simple as not doing
 

00:06:27.889 --> 00:06:29.469
would just be as simple as not doing
anything to the back stack leave it as

00:06:29.469 --> 00:06:29.479
anything to the back stack leave it as
 

00:06:29.479 --> 00:06:32.709
anything to the back stack leave it as
is whatever was in there previously will

00:06:32.709 --> 00:06:32.719
is whatever was in there previously will
 

00:06:32.719 --> 00:06:34.119
is whatever was in there previously will
still be your previous entry and when

00:06:34.119 --> 00:06:34.129
still be your previous entry and when
 

00:06:34.129 --> 00:06:36.249
still be your previous entry and when
you hit back over to that and any more

00:06:36.249 --> 00:06:36.259
you hit back over to that and any more
 

00:06:36.259 --> 00:06:38.079
you hit back over to that and any more
interesting question is is is the

00:06:38.079 --> 00:06:38.089
interesting question is is is the
 

00:06:38.089 --> 00:06:40.449
interesting question is is is the
question if you have a you have a

00:06:40.449 --> 00:06:40.459
question if you have a you have a
 

00:06:40.459 --> 00:06:41.889
question if you have a you have a
fragment and you click on something in

00:06:41.889 --> 00:06:41.899
fragment and you click on something in
 

00:06:41.899 --> 00:06:43.779
fragment and you click on something in
one fragment and replaces that fragment

00:06:43.779 --> 00:06:43.789
one fragment and replaces that fragment
 

00:06:43.789 --> 00:06:45.930
one fragment and replaces that fragment
with another fragment

00:06:45.930 --> 00:06:45.940
with another fragment
 

00:06:45.940 --> 00:06:49.080
with another fragment
and my assumption in this one nice my

00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:49.090
and my assumption in this one nice my
 

00:06:49.090 --> 00:06:51.650
and my assumption in this one nice my
assumption in this one is that if we

00:06:51.650 --> 00:06:51.660
assumption in this one is that if we
 

00:06:51.660 --> 00:06:56.160
assumption in this one is that if we
actually are again having two methods of

00:06:56.160 --> 00:06:56.170
actually are again having two methods of
 

00:06:56.170 --> 00:06:57.840
actually are again having two methods of
switching between these fragments one

00:06:57.840 --> 00:06:57.850
switching between these fragments one
 

00:06:57.850 --> 00:06:59.430
switching between these fragments one
that's that's using spinners and one

00:06:59.430 --> 00:06:59.440
that's that's using spinners and one
 

00:06:59.440 --> 00:07:02.310
that's that's using spinners and one
that's using the you know being able to

00:07:02.310 --> 00:07:02.320
that's using the you know being able to
 

00:07:02.320 --> 00:07:04.260
that's using the you know being able to
click on one fragment replace it it

00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:04.270
click on one fragment replace it it
 

00:07:04.270 --> 00:07:05.730
click on one fragment replace it it
probably makes sense and not put it on

00:07:05.730 --> 00:07:05.740
probably makes sense and not put it on
 

00:07:05.740 --> 00:07:08.070
probably makes sense and not put it on
the back stack it is you know feeling

00:07:08.070 --> 00:07:08.080
the back stack it is you know feeling
 

00:07:08.080 --> 00:07:10.680
the back stack it is you know feeling
again like a transition to a completely

00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:10.690
again like a transition to a completely
 

00:07:10.690 --> 00:07:12.030
again like a transition to a completely
different state than it may make sense

00:07:12.030 --> 00:07:12.040
different state than it may make sense
 

00:07:12.040 --> 00:07:13.950
different state than it may make sense
and I think that's that one's the only

00:07:13.950 --> 00:07:13.960
and I think that's that one's the only
 

00:07:13.960 --> 00:07:15.300
and I think that's that one's the only
thing it's tricky at that point is you

00:07:15.300 --> 00:07:15.310
thing it's tricky at that point is you
 

00:07:15.310 --> 00:07:16.800
thing it's tricky at that point is you
know what happens to those spinners in

00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:16.810
know what happens to those spinners in
 

00:07:16.810 --> 00:07:18.360
know what happens to those spinners in
the action bar you actually changing the

00:07:18.360 --> 00:07:18.370
the action bar you actually changing the
 

00:07:18.370 --> 00:07:19.770
the action bar you actually changing the
state of the action bar to disable those

00:07:19.770 --> 00:07:19.780
state of the action bar to disable those
 

00:07:19.780 --> 00:07:21.570
state of the action bar to disable those
spinners at that point and again there's

00:07:21.570 --> 00:07:21.580
spinners at that point and again there's
 

00:07:21.580 --> 00:07:22.650
spinners at that point and again there's
just not enough information this

00:07:22.650 --> 00:07:22.660
just not enough information this
 

00:07:22.660 --> 00:07:24.240
just not enough information this
question to give a really thorough

00:07:24.240 --> 00:07:24.250
question to give a really thorough
 

00:07:24.250 --> 00:07:26.820
question to give a really thorough
answer but I think I think again it

00:07:26.820 --> 00:07:26.830
answer but I think I think again it
 

00:07:26.830 --> 00:07:28.080
answer but I think I think again it
ultimately comes down to the user

00:07:28.080 --> 00:07:28.090
ultimately comes down to the user
 

00:07:28.090 --> 00:07:30.210
ultimately comes down to the user
experience as far as managing the back

00:07:30.210 --> 00:07:30.220
experience as far as managing the back
 

00:07:30.220 --> 00:07:32.580
experience as far as managing the back
stack itself you know you obviously it's

00:07:32.580 --> 00:07:32.590
stack itself you know you obviously it's
 

00:07:32.590 --> 00:07:35.280
stack itself you know you obviously it's
fairly straightforward to assign IDs to

00:07:35.280 --> 00:07:35.290
fairly straightforward to assign IDs to
 

00:07:35.290 --> 00:07:37.980
fairly straightforward to assign IDs to
the various fragments and you can

00:07:37.980 --> 00:07:37.990
the various fragments and you can
 

00:07:37.990 --> 00:07:40.020
the various fragments and you can
actually you know very easily look to

00:07:40.020 --> 00:07:40.030
actually you know very easily look to
 

00:07:40.030 --> 00:07:42.000
actually you know very easily look to
see whether that fragment is currently

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:42.010
see whether that fragment is currently
 

00:07:42.010 --> 00:07:44.070
see whether that fragment is currently
in the back stack you can pull it out of

00:07:44.070 --> 00:07:44.080
in the back stack you can pull it out of
 

00:07:44.080 --> 00:07:45.630
in the back stack you can pull it out of
the backstabbers there's a lot of stuff

00:07:45.630 --> 00:07:45.640
the backstabbers there's a lot of stuff
 

00:07:45.640 --> 00:07:48.870
the backstabbers there's a lot of stuff
in fragments actually magic but you in

00:07:48.870 --> 00:07:48.880
in fragments actually magic but you in
 

00:07:48.880 --> 00:07:50.220
in fragments actually magic but you in
this case we're really talking about the

00:07:50.220 --> 00:07:50.230
this case we're really talking about the
 

00:07:50.230 --> 00:07:51.960
this case we're really talking about the
user experience rather than you know the

00:07:51.960 --> 00:07:51.970
user experience rather than you know the
 

00:07:51.970 --> 00:07:54.930
user experience rather than you know the
kind of mechanics of it right and I

00:07:54.930 --> 00:07:54.940
kind of mechanics of it right and I
 

00:07:54.940 --> 00:07:56.670
kind of mechanics of it right and I
think a good example if you need

00:07:56.670 --> 00:07:56.680
think a good example if you need
 

00:07:56.680 --> 00:07:57.900
think a good example if you need
something to look at it what correct

00:07:57.900 --> 00:07:57.910
something to look at it what correct
 

00:07:57.910 --> 00:08:00.030
something to look at it what correct
behavior would be would be gmail so

00:08:00.030 --> 00:08:00.040
behavior would be would be gmail so
 

00:08:00.040 --> 00:08:01.980
behavior would be would be gmail so
gmail has a spinner in the action bar it

00:08:01.980 --> 00:08:01.990
gmail has a spinner in the action bar it
 

00:08:01.990 --> 00:08:03.360
gmail has a spinner in the action bar it
has a lot of different activities a lot

00:08:03.360 --> 00:08:03.370
has a lot of different activities a lot
 

00:08:03.370 --> 00:08:06.510
has a lot of different activities a lot
of different states and so add to google

00:08:06.510 --> 00:08:06.520
of different states and so add to google
 

00:08:06.520 --> 00:08:08.430
of different states and so add to google
accounts to your phone fire up gmail and

00:08:08.430 --> 00:08:08.440
accounts to your phone fire up gmail and
 

00:08:08.440 --> 00:08:10.080
accounts to your phone fire up gmail and
play around right you'll notice if you

00:08:10.080 --> 00:08:10.090
play around right you'll notice if you
 

00:08:10.090 --> 00:08:12.030
play around right you'll notice if you
do switch accounts and you hit back it

00:08:12.030 --> 00:08:12.040
do switch accounts and you hit back it
 

00:08:12.040 --> 00:08:12.960
do switch accounts and you hit back it
doesn't switch back to that they're

00:08:12.960 --> 00:08:12.970
doesn't switch back to that they're
 

00:08:12.970 --> 00:08:15.090
doesn't switch back to that they're
counted it doesn't count that as a state

00:08:15.090 --> 00:08:15.100
counted it doesn't count that as a state
 

00:08:15.100 --> 00:08:17.730
counted it doesn't count that as a state
change but if you you know if you open

00:08:17.730 --> 00:08:17.740
change but if you you know if you open
 

00:08:17.740 --> 00:08:20.550
change but if you you know if you open
the menu a message and go back that does

00:08:20.550 --> 00:08:20.560
the menu a message and go back that does
 

00:08:20.560 --> 00:08:22.260
the menu a message and go back that does
now when you do open a message the

00:08:22.260 --> 00:08:22.270
now when you do open a message the
 

00:08:22.270 --> 00:08:23.790
now when you do open a message the
spinner disappears and it gets replaced

00:08:23.790 --> 00:08:23.800
spinner disappears and it gets replaced
 

00:08:23.800 --> 00:08:25.530
spinner disappears and it gets replaced
with the action bar it's updated to

00:08:25.530 --> 00:08:25.540
with the action bar it's updated to
 

00:08:25.540 --> 00:08:27.450
with the action bar it's updated to
reflect your new context which is

00:08:27.450 --> 00:08:27.460
reflect your new context which is
 

00:08:27.460 --> 00:08:29.370
reflect your new context which is
viewing a message rather than viewing

00:08:29.370 --> 00:08:29.380
viewing a message rather than viewing
 

00:08:29.380 --> 00:08:31.470
viewing a message rather than viewing
your account list in your message list

00:08:31.470 --> 00:08:31.480
your account list in your message list
 

00:08:31.480 --> 00:08:34.440
your account list in your message list
so a lot of subtle details there you

00:08:34.440 --> 00:08:34.450
so a lot of subtle details there you
 

00:08:34.450 --> 00:08:35.610
so a lot of subtle details there you
need to take into account but I think

00:08:35.610 --> 00:08:35.620
need to take into account but I think
 

00:08:35.620 --> 00:08:38.630
need to take into account but I think
that's a good example

00:08:38.630 --> 00:08:38.640
 
 

00:08:38.640 --> 00:08:42.990
 
okay thank you gentleman question I'd

00:08:42.990 --> 00:08:43.000
okay thank you gentleman question I'd
 

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:45.269
okay thank you gentleman question I'd
like to put a viewpager on half of a to

00:08:45.269 --> 00:08:45.279
like to put a viewpager on half of a to
 

00:08:45.279 --> 00:08:48.090
like to put a viewpager on half of a to
pain layout can I put a viewpager in a

00:08:48.090 --> 00:08:48.100
pain layout can I put a viewpager in a
 

00:08:48.100 --> 00:08:50.070
pain layout can I put a viewpager in a
fragment and more fragments in that view

00:08:50.070 --> 00:08:50.080
fragment and more fragments in that view
 

00:08:50.080 --> 00:08:52.500
fragment and more fragments in that view
pager I'd like my left pane to hold

00:08:52.500 --> 00:08:52.510
pager I'd like my left pane to hold
 

00:08:52.510 --> 00:08:54.449
pager I'd like my left pane to hold
swipeable lists on the right pane to

00:08:54.449 --> 00:08:54.459
swipeable lists on the right pane to
 

00:08:54.459 --> 00:08:56.550
swipeable lists on the right pane to
contain details of list items that are

00:08:56.550 --> 00:08:56.560
contain details of list items that are
 

00:08:56.560 --> 00:09:00.360
contain details of list items that are
clicked so this is one of those cases in

00:09:00.360 --> 00:09:00.370
clicked so this is one of those cases in
 

00:09:00.370 --> 00:09:04.680
clicked so this is one of those cases in
which I would say that it's not strictly

00:09:04.680 --> 00:09:04.690
which I would say that it's not strictly
 

00:09:04.690 --> 00:09:07.949
which I would say that it's not strictly
necessary to use a fragment and in fact

00:09:07.949 --> 00:09:07.959
necessary to use a fragment and in fact
 

00:09:07.959 --> 00:09:11.820
necessary to use a fragment and in fact

putting fragments within fragments you

00:09:17.940 --> 00:09:17.950
putting fragments within fragments you
 

00:09:17.950 --> 00:09:19.230
putting fragments within fragments you
know the goal but that's really what

00:09:19.230 --> 00:09:19.240
know the goal but that's really what
 

00:09:19.240 --> 00:09:21.300
know the goal but that's really what

screen view that's going to have an
 

00:09:36.850 --> 00:09:38.639
screen view that's going to have an
activity about a fragment stack

00:09:38.639 --> 00:09:38.649
activity about a fragment stack
 

00:09:38.649 --> 00:09:40.590
activity about a fragment stack
associated with it or if it's going to

00:09:40.590 --> 00:09:40.600
associated with it or if it's going to
 

00:09:40.600 --> 00:09:43.949

be in you know side by side like tablet

00:09:43.949 --> 00:09:43.959
be in you know side by side like tablet
 

00:09:43.959 --> 00:09:45.690

layout it's it's trying to take those

00:09:45.690 --> 00:09:45.700
layout it's it's trying to take those
 

00:09:45.700 --> 00:09:47.550
layout it's it's trying to take those
pieces and turn them into reusable

00:09:47.550 --> 00:09:47.560
pieces and turn them into reusable
 

00:09:47.560 --> 00:09:49.860
pieces and turn them into reusable
components in this case I think it's

00:09:49.860 --> 00:09:49.870
components in this case I think it's
 

00:09:49.870 --> 00:09:52.140
components in this case I think it's
it's almost always a better idea to

00:09:52.140 --> 00:09:52.150
it's almost always a better idea to
 

00:09:52.150 --> 00:09:54.180
it's almost always a better idea to
actually just use the view hierarchy

00:09:54.180 --> 00:09:54.190
actually just use the view hierarchy
 

00:09:54.190 --> 00:10:01.890
actually just use the view hierarchy
itself the the actual pager actually

00:10:01.890 --> 00:10:01.900
itself the the actual pager actually
 

00:10:01.900 --> 00:10:04.260
itself the the actual pager actually
does not view pager actually can be done

00:10:04.260 --> 00:10:04.270
does not view pager actually can be done
 

00:10:04.270 --> 00:10:06.000
does not view pager actually can be done
without any fragments at all it works

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:06.010
without any fragments at all it works
 

00:10:06.010 --> 00:10:09.269
without any fragments at all it works
quite well just with views and ergo view

00:10:09.269 --> 00:10:09.279
quite well just with views and ergo view

quite well just with views and ergo view
pager and and not that's how I would do

00:10:12.060 --> 00:10:12.070
pager and and not that's how I would do
 

00:10:12.070 --> 00:10:13.380
pager and and not that's how I would do
it I don't think there's a particular

00:10:13.380 --> 00:10:13.390
it I don't think there's a particular
 

00:10:13.390 --> 00:10:15.870
it I don't think there's a particular
advantage in using a fragment here now

00:10:15.870 --> 00:10:15.880
advantage in using a fragment here now
 

00:10:15.880 --> 00:10:18.090
advantage in using a fragment here now
let's say that you still have some

let's say that you still have some
 

00:10:18.100 --> 00:10:20.699
let's say that you still have some
reason that you want to do this there

reason that you want to do this there
are some caveats that you should be

00:10:22.110 --> 00:10:22.120
are some caveats that you should be
 

00:10:22.120 --> 00:10:24.390
are some caveats that you should be
aware from a technical perspective if

00:10:24.390 --> 00:10:24.400
aware from a technical perspective if
 

00:10:24.400 --> 00:10:28.769
aware from a technical perspective if
you try and display a fragment or if you

00:10:28.769 --> 00:10:28.779
you try and display a fragment or if you
 

00:10:28.779 --> 00:10:30.510
you try and display a fragment or if you
paid your inside of a fragment which

00:10:30.510 --> 00:10:30.520
paid your inside of a fragment which
 

00:10:30.520 --> 00:10:33.300
paid your inside of a fragment which
contains another view pager fragment

00:10:33.300 --> 00:10:33.310

manager can get a little bit confused

00:10:34.800 --> 00:10:34.810
manager can get a little bit confused
 

00:10:34.810 --> 00:10:36.870
manager can get a little bit confused
about how to resolve all of that when

00:10:36.870 --> 00:10:36.880
about how to resolve all of that when
 

00:10:36.880 --> 00:10:39.600
about how to resolve all of that when
you do a transition and from what I've

00:10:39.600 --> 00:10:39.610
you do a transition and from what I've
 

00:10:39.610 --> 00:10:40.710
you do a transition and from what I've
heard even though I'm never going to do

00:10:40.710 --> 00:10:40.720
heard even though I'm never going to do
 

00:10:40.720 --> 00:10:43.980
heard even though I'm never going to do
myself you can you know the solution we

00:10:43.980 --> 00:10:43.990
myself you can you know the solution we
 

00:10:43.990 --> 00:10:46.050
myself you can you know the solution we
to make sure that you don't set your

00:10:46.050 --> 00:10:46.060
to make sure that you don't set your
 

00:10:46.060 --> 00:10:48.360
to make sure that you don't set your
view pagers adapter until after the

00:10:48.360 --> 00:10:48.370
view pagers adapter until after the
 

00:10:48.370 --> 00:10:50.490
view pagers adapter until after the
first transition is completed and then

00:10:50.490 --> 00:10:50.500
first transition is completed and then
 

00:10:50.500 --> 00:10:51.780
first transition is completed and then
that's as simple as making sure that's

00:10:51.780 --> 00:10:51.790
that's as simple as making sure that's
 

00:10:51.790 --> 00:10:53.220
that's as simple as making sure that's
done inside of an async task or a

done inside of an async task or a
 

00:10:53.230 --> 00:10:55.949
done inside of an async task or a
handler something like that just making

00:10:55.949 --> 00:10:55.959
handler something like that just making
 

00:10:55.959 --> 00:10:58.050
handler something like that just making
sure that it's delayed a bit and then by

00:10:58.050 --> 00:10:58.060
sure that it's delayed a bit and then by
 

00:10:58.060 --> 00:11:00.000
sure that it's delayed a bit and then by
the time you're rendering that the

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:00.010
the time you're rendering that the
 

00:11:00.010 --> 00:11:01.829

second fragment the first fragments

00:11:01.829 --> 00:11:01.839

00:11:01.839 --> 00:11:04.260
second fragment the first fragments
already there again though you probably

00:11:04.260 --> 00:11:04.270
already there again though you probably
 

00:11:04.270 --> 00:11:06.510
already there again though you probably
don't want to be doing this yeah I mean

00:11:06.510 --> 00:11:06.520
don't want to be doing this yeah I mean
 

00:11:06.520 --> 00:11:09.180
don't want to be doing this yeah I mean
you can definitely put a view pager you

00:11:09.180 --> 00:11:09.190
you can definitely put a view pager you
 

00:11:09.190 --> 00:11:10.680
you can definitely put a view pager you
know inside of a fragment and you can

00:11:10.680 --> 00:11:10.690
know inside of a fragment and you can
 

00:11:10.690 --> 00:11:12.720
know inside of a fragment and you can
certainly put whatever you want inside

00:11:12.720 --> 00:11:12.730
certainly put whatever you want inside
 

00:11:12.730 --> 00:11:15.269
certainly put whatever you want inside
of that view pager you know the real

00:11:15.269 --> 00:11:15.279
of that view pager you know the real
 

00:11:15.279 --> 00:11:16.439
of that view pager you know the real
tricky thing is of course is when you

00:11:16.439 --> 00:11:16.449
tricky thing is of course is when you
 

00:11:16.449 --> 00:11:17.910
tricky thing is of course is when you
get if these multiple you pager States

00:11:17.910 --> 00:11:17.920
get if these multiple you pager States
 

00:11:17.920 --> 00:11:21.630
get if these multiple you pager States
and there is a mechanism that's actually

00:11:21.630 --> 00:11:21.640
and there is a mechanism that's actually
 

00:11:21.640 --> 00:11:27.300
and there is a mechanism that's actually
in jellybean that actually does handle

00:11:27.300 --> 00:11:27.310
in jellybean that actually does handle
 

00:11:27.310 --> 00:11:29.480
in jellybean that actually does handle
some of this unfortunately it's not

00:11:29.480 --> 00:11:29.490
some of this unfortunately it's not
 

00:11:29.490 --> 00:11:31.650
some of this unfortunately it's not
which allows it to actually track the

00:11:31.650 --> 00:11:31.660
which allows it to actually track the
 

00:11:31.660 --> 00:11:33.689
which allows it to actually track the
scroll ability of an internal window

00:11:33.689 --> 00:11:33.699
scroll ability of an internal window
 

00:11:33.699 --> 00:11:35.069
scroll ability of an internal window
which allows a lot of like you have you

00:11:35.069 --> 00:11:35.079
which allows a lot of like you have you
 

00:11:35.079 --> 00:11:36.150
which allows a lot of like you have you
page within a view pager you can

00:11:36.150 --> 00:11:36.160
page within a view pager you can
 

00:11:36.160 --> 00:11:37.439
page within a view pager you can
actually do stuff like scroll to the end

00:11:37.439 --> 00:11:37.449
actually do stuff like scroll to the end
 

00:11:37.449 --> 00:11:39.240
actually do stuff like scroll to the end
of one and then have that once it's

00:11:39.240 --> 00:11:39.250
of one and then have that once it's
 

00:11:39.250 --> 00:11:40.890
of one and then have that once it's
finished scrolling it'll actually scroll

00:11:40.890 --> 00:11:40.900
finished scrolling it'll actually scroll
 

00:11:40.900 --> 00:11:44.250
finished scrolling it'll actually scroll
to the next in the primary pager stuff

00:11:44.250 --> 00:11:44.260
to the next in the primary pager stuff
 

00:11:44.260 --> 00:11:47.310
to the next in the primary pager stuff
like that but none of that is actually

00:11:47.310 --> 00:11:47.320
like that but none of that is actually
 

00:11:47.320 --> 00:11:50.640
like that but none of that is actually
available in the default implementation

00:11:50.640 --> 00:11:50.650

00:22:11.400 --> 00:22:12.890
effect and normally that should be
automatic as soon as you call that

00:22:12.890 --> 00:22:12.900
automatic as soon as you call that
 

00:22:12.900 --> 00:22:15.470
automatic as soon as you call that
method the update near the content

00:22:15.470 --> 00:22:15.480
method the update near the content
 

00:22:15.480 --> 00:22:18.049
method the update near the content
should change so something I find I'm

00:22:18.049 --> 00:22:18.059
should change so something I find I'm
 

00:22:18.059 --> 00:22:21.310
should change so something I find I'm
using an array list to back the adapter

00:22:21.310 --> 00:22:21.320
using an array list to back the adapter
 

00:22:21.320 --> 00:22:24.320
using an array list to back the adapter
and I change the array list then I

00:22:24.320 --> 00:22:24.330
and I change the array list then I
 

00:22:24.330 --> 00:22:27.860
and I change the array list then I
should just tell call notify data set

00:22:27.860 --> 00:22:27.870
should just tell call notify data set
 

00:22:27.870 --> 00:22:29.480
should just tell call notify data set
that changes on the adapter that's

00:22:29.480 --> 00:22:29.490
that changes on the adapter that's
 

00:22:29.490 --> 00:22:32.740
that changes on the adapter that's
correct and then so I need to register

00:22:32.740 --> 00:22:32.750
correct and then so I need to register
 

00:22:32.750 --> 00:22:35.299
correct and then so I need to register
the actual spinner with that right or

00:22:35.299 --> 00:22:35.309
the actual spinner with that right or
 

00:22:35.309 --> 00:22:38.570
the actual spinner with that right or
does that automatically call do that

00:22:38.570 --> 00:22:38.580
does that automatically call do that
 

00:22:38.580 --> 00:22:39.770
does that automatically call do that
automatically cause the spinner an

00:22:39.770 --> 00:22:39.780
automatically cause the spinner an
 

00:22:39.780 --> 00:22:41.960
automatically cause the spinner an
update the spinner should update as soon

00:22:41.960 --> 00:22:41.970
update the spinner should update as soon
 

00:22:41.970 --> 00:22:45.049
update the spinner should update as soon
as your adapter has been updated yeah

00:22:45.049 --> 00:22:45.059
as your adapter has been updated yeah
 

00:22:45.059 --> 00:22:47.000
as your adapter has been updated yeah
well the spinner is it would notice it

00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:47.010
well the spinner is it would notice it
 

00:22:47.010 --> 00:22:50.360
well the spinner is it would notice it
when notified dataset changed I think

00:22:50.360 --> 00:22:50.370
when notified dataset changed I think
 

00:22:50.370 --> 00:22:51.680
when notified dataset changed I think
you have to register them I think

00:22:51.680 --> 00:22:51.690
you have to register them I think
 

00:22:51.690 --> 00:22:53.390
you have to register them I think
notified data fit don't notify did set

00:22:53.390 --> 00:22:53.400
notified data fit don't notify did set
 

00:22:53.400 --> 00:22:55.450
notified data fit don't notify did set
changes is usually when you're tied to a

00:22:55.450 --> 00:22:55.460
changes is usually when you're tied to a
 

00:22:55.460 --> 00:22:58.159
changes is usually when you're tied to a
type of content right that's true that's

00:22:58.159 --> 00:22:58.169
type of content right that's true that's
 

00:22:58.169 --> 00:22:59.720
type of content right that's true that's
true right so so we're talking about it

00:22:59.720 --> 00:22:59.730
true right so so we're talking about it
 

00:22:59.730 --> 00:23:01.460
true right so so we're talking about it
fun so if you're not actually doing

00:23:01.460 --> 00:23:01.470
fun so if you're not actually doing
 

00:23:01.470 --> 00:23:03.340

generating this from a content provider

00:23:03.340 --> 00:23:03.350
generating this from a content provider
 

00:23:03.350 --> 00:23:07.400
generating this from a content provider
then then notified state data set change

00:23:07.400 --> 00:23:07.410
then then notified state data set change
 

00:23:07.410 --> 00:23:08.510
then then notified state data set change
is going to do anything because it's

00:23:08.510 --> 00:23:08.520
is going to do anything because it's
 

00:23:08.520 --> 00:23:09.799

registered content listeners and there

00:23:11.570 --> 00:23:11.580
registered content listeners and there
 

00:23:11.580 --> 00:23:12.830

possible that you're actually making a

00:23:22.280 --> 00:23:22.290
possible that you're actually making a
 

00:23:22.290 --> 00:23:23.720
possible that you're actually making a
copy of the Ray when you try to update

00:23:23.720 --> 00:23:23.730
copy of the Ray when you try to update
 

00:23:23.730 --> 00:23:26.150

it and the adapter still has a handle on

00:23:26.150 --> 00:23:26.160
it and the adapter still has a handle on
 

00:23:26.160 --> 00:23:28.820
it and the adapter still has a handle on
the old one is it is it is it possible

00:23:28.820 --> 00:23:28.830
the old one is it is it is it possible
 

00:23:28.830 --> 00:23:30.980
the old one is it is it is it possible
that actually happening somehow uh well

00:23:30.980 --> 00:23:30.990
that actually happening somehow uh well
 

00:23:30.990 --> 00:23:33.440
that actually happening somehow uh well
i have a class that keeps track of that

00:23:33.440 --> 00:23:33.450
i have a class that keeps track of that
 

00:23:33.450 --> 00:23:36.440
i have a class that keeps track of that
array list and it will reorder things in

00:23:36.440 --> 00:23:36.450
array list and it will reorder things in
 

00:23:36.450 --> 00:23:38.300
array list and it will reorder things in
the list remove things from the list add

00:23:38.300 --> 00:23:38.310
the list remove things from the list add
 

00:23:38.310 --> 00:23:41.030
the list remove things from the list add
things to the list and then after that

00:23:41.030 --> 00:23:41.040
things to the list and then after that
 

00:23:41.040 --> 00:23:44.420
things to the list and then after that
function returns is when i'm trying to a

00:23:44.420 --> 00:23:44.430
function returns is when i'm trying to a
 

00:23:44.430 --> 00:23:47.450
function returns is when i'm trying to a
big spinner okay so it probably should

00:23:47.450 --> 00:23:47.460
big spinner okay so it probably should
 

00:23:47.460 --> 00:23:50.170
big spinner okay so it probably should
still be the same copy then right

00:23:50.170 --> 00:23:50.180
still be the same copy then right
 

00:23:50.180 --> 00:23:52.220
still be the same copy then right
entrusting so right now the only way I

00:23:52.220 --> 00:23:52.230
entrusting so right now the only way I
 

00:23:52.230 --> 00:23:55.220
entrusting so right now the only way I
it works most of the time except for

00:23:55.220 --> 00:23:55.230
it works most of the time except for
 

00:23:55.230 --> 00:23:57.890
it works most of the time except for
after a little bit afterwards you know

00:23:57.890 --> 00:23:57.900
after a little bit afterwards you know
 

00:23:57.900 --> 00:24:00.830
after a little bit afterwards you know
so a certain amount of interaction like

00:24:00.830 --> 00:24:00.840
so a certain amount of interaction like
 

00:24:00.840 --> 00:24:03.080
so a certain amount of interaction like
because we're done for you same contents

00:24:03.080 --> 00:24:03.090
because we're done for you same contents
 

00:24:03.090 --> 00:24:04.940
because we're done for you same contents
that's why you're changing out your your

00:24:04.940 --> 00:24:04.950
that's why you're changing out your your
 

00:24:04.950 --> 00:24:07.490
that's why you're changing out your your
adapter though right right yeah I really

00:24:07.490 --> 00:24:07.500
adapter though right right yeah I really
 

00:24:07.500 --> 00:24:09.230
adapter though right right yeah I really
shouldn't have to go and change the

00:24:09.230 --> 00:24:09.240
shouldn't have to go and change the
 

00:24:09.240 --> 00:24:10.780
shouldn't have to go and change the
whole adapter I think I think that's

00:24:10.780 --> 00:24:10.790
whole adapter I think I think that's
 

00:24:10.790 --> 00:24:12.710
whole adapter I think I think that's
definitely not the right way to go

00:24:12.710 --> 00:24:12.720
definitely not the right way to go
 

00:24:12.720 --> 00:24:14.780
definitely not the right way to go
that's first off you even ignoring the

00:24:14.780 --> 00:24:14.790
that's first off you even ignoring the
 

00:24:14.790 --> 00:24:16.640
that's first off you even ignoring the
fact that this is breaking swapping an

00:24:16.640 --> 00:24:16.650
fact that this is breaking swapping an
 

00:24:16.650 --> 00:24:19.130
fact that this is breaking swapping an
adapter is a a relatively heavy

00:24:19.130 --> 00:24:19.140
adapter is a a relatively heavy
 

00:24:19.140 --> 00:24:21.860
adapter is a a relatively heavy
operation so you think it back the way

00:24:21.860 --> 00:24:21.870
operation so you think it back the way
 

00:24:21.870 --> 00:24:23.890
operation so you think it back the way
it's supposed to work your adapter

00:24:23.890 --> 00:24:23.900
it's supposed to work your adapter
 

00:24:23.900 --> 00:24:25.820
it's supposed to work your adapter
normally is tied to a sequel like

00:24:25.820 --> 00:24:25.830
normally is tied to a sequel like
 

00:24:25.830 --> 00:24:27.230
normally is tied to a sequel like
database you know nothing wrong with

00:24:27.230 --> 00:24:27.240
database you know nothing wrong with
 

00:24:27.240 --> 00:24:28.640
database you know nothing wrong with
hanging it to an array or anything else

00:24:28.640 --> 00:24:28.650
hanging it to an array or anything else
 

00:24:28.650 --> 00:24:30.290
hanging it to an array or anything else
but normally they're tied to a database

00:24:30.290 --> 00:24:30.300
but normally they're tied to a database
 

00:24:30.300 --> 00:24:32.510
but normally they're tied to a database
and every time the database updates

00:24:32.510 --> 00:24:32.520
and every time the database updates
 

00:24:32.520 --> 00:24:33.710
and every time the database updates
you're not going to go and rebuild a

00:24:33.710 --> 00:24:33.720
you're not going to go and rebuild a
 

00:24:33.720 --> 00:24:35.570
you're not going to go and rebuild a
whole new adapter and updated it should

00:24:35.570 --> 00:24:35.580
whole new adapter and updated it should
 

00:24:35.580 --> 00:24:40.280
whole new adapter and updated it should
just update in place so so then how do i

00:24:40.280 --> 00:24:40.290
just update in place so so then how do i
 

00:24:40.290 --> 00:24:42.500
just update in place so so then how do i
get the spinner to update when i change

00:24:42.500 --> 00:24:42.510
get the spinner to update when i change
 

00:24:42.510 --> 00:24:45.200
get the spinner to update when i change
the ArrayList that's a good question now

00:24:45.200 --> 00:24:45.210
the ArrayList that's a good question now
 

00:24:45.210 --> 00:24:48.050
the ArrayList that's a good question now
I'm aaj normally at my understanding was

00:24:48.050 --> 00:24:48.060
I'm aaj normally at my understanding was
 

00:24:48.060 --> 00:24:49.760
I'm aaj normally at my understanding was
just something the ArrayList should be

00:24:49.760 --> 00:24:49.770
just something the ArrayList should be
 

00:24:49.770 --> 00:24:52.820
just something the ArrayList should be
enough the answer was stolen and

00:24:52.820 --> 00:24:52.830
enough the answer was stolen and
 

00:24:52.830 --> 00:24:55.790
enough the answer was stolen and
validate the view maybe or you shouldn't

00:24:55.790 --> 00:24:55.800
validate the view maybe or you shouldn't
 

00:24:55.800 --> 00:24:56.960
validate the view maybe or you shouldn't
have to do that that's something that

00:24:56.960 --> 00:24:56.970
have to do that that's something that
 

00:24:56.970 --> 00:24:59.880
have to do that that's something that
the spinner should do itself

00:24:59.880 --> 00:24:59.890
the spinner should do itself
 

00:24:59.890 --> 00:25:04.140
the spinner should do itself
mm-hmm are you anything right definitely

00:25:04.140 --> 00:25:04.150
mm-hmm are you anything right definitely
 

00:25:04.150 --> 00:25:09.480
mm-hmm are you anything right definitely
didn't work staying yeah I think I also

00:25:09.480 --> 00:25:09.490
didn't work staying yeah I think I also
 

00:25:09.490 --> 00:25:10.500
didn't work staying yeah I think I also
gonna take a look at what what's

00:25:10.500 --> 00:25:10.510
gonna take a look at what what's
 

00:25:10.510 --> 00:25:12.570
gonna take a look at what what's
actually going on the code um you know

00:25:12.570 --> 00:25:12.580
actually going on the code um you know
 

00:25:12.580 --> 00:25:16.530
actually going on the code um you know
my my experience is that it is that it

00:25:16.530 --> 00:25:16.540
my my experience is that it is that it
 

00:25:16.540 --> 00:25:20.120
my my experience is that it is that it
should cease notifies gays have changed

00:25:20.120 --> 00:25:20.130

it's been a while since I because

00:25:23.310 --> 00:25:23.320
it's been a while since I because
 

00:25:23.320 --> 00:25:24.390
it's been a while since I because
because because the problem is it is it

00:25:24.390 --> 00:25:24.400
because because the problem is it is it
 

00:25:24.400 --> 00:25:25.860

observer pattern in the content observer
 

00:25:27.310 --> 00:25:35.550
observer pattern in the content observer
pattern is all right I mean the way this

00:25:35.550 --> 00:25:35.560
pattern is all right I mean the way this
 

00:25:35.560 --> 00:25:38.520

00:25:50.480 --> 00:25:50.490
that's your data observer essentially
 

00:25:50.490 --> 00:25:52.380
that's your data observer essentially

this done stack overflow for you guys to
look at but basically the pattern is i

00:26:34.900 --> 00:26:34.910
look at but basically the pattern is i

it notifies the activity and they right
now the activity resets the adapter

00:26:48.490 --> 00:26:48.500
now the activity resets the adapter

now the activity resets the adapter
which is obviously incorrect but it

00:26:51.790 --> 00:26:51.800
which is obviously incorrect but it

okay it is a little odd to that if

00:27:10.930 --> 00:27:10.940
okay it is a little odd to that if

the spinner will suddenly stopped

00:27:16.990 --> 00:27:17.000
the spinner will suddenly stopped
 

00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:20.260
the spinner will suddenly stopped
working right like we implemented a

00:27:20.260 --> 00:27:20.270
working right like we implemented a
 

00:27:20.270 --> 00:27:25.930
working right like we implemented a
sliding drawer type of view and if I if

00:27:25.930 --> 00:27:25.940
sliding drawer type of view and if I if
 

00:27:25.940 --> 00:27:29.170
sliding drawer type of view and if I if
I use a view element in that drawer then

00:27:29.170 --> 00:27:29.180
I use a view element in that drawer then
 

00:27:29.180 --> 00:27:33.090
I use a view element in that drawer then
the spinner completely stops working and

00:27:33.090 --> 00:27:33.100
the spinner completely stops working and
 

00:27:33.100 --> 00:27:35.800
the spinner completely stops working and
this doesn't modify your way at all

00:27:35.800 --> 00:27:35.810
this doesn't modify your way at all
 

00:27:35.810 --> 00:27:38.320
this doesn't modify your way at all
right in your data forever same no no

00:27:38.320 --> 00:27:38.330
right in your data forever same no no
 

00:27:38.330 --> 00:27:40.270
right in your data forever same no no
changes to the data set I haven't even

00:27:40.270 --> 00:27:40.280
changes to the data set I haven't even
 

00:27:40.280 --> 00:27:44.860
changes to the data set I haven't even
modified the the data adapter okay let

00:27:44.860 --> 00:27:44.870
modified the the data adapter okay let
 

00:27:44.870 --> 00:27:46.210
modified the the data adapter okay let
me say yes you're not changing it there

00:27:46.210 --> 00:27:46.220
me say yes you're not changing it there
 

00:27:46.220 --> 00:27:47.680
me say yes you're not changing it there
so there's got to be a second issue of

so there's got to be a second issue of
 

00:27:47.690 --> 00:27:51.100
so there's got to be a second issue of
play yeah I think we need to take a look

00:27:51.100 --> 00:27:51.110
play yeah I think we need to take a look
 

00:27:51.110 --> 00:27:53.380
play yeah I think we need to take a look
at your code something it's probably

00:27:53.380 --> 00:27:53.390
at your code something it's probably
 

00:27:53.390 --> 00:27:55.810
at your code something it's probably
something very subtle I mean your

00:27:55.810 --> 00:27:55.820
something very subtle I mean your
 

00:27:55.820 --> 00:27:57.340
something very subtle I mean your

it should be causing this many problems
right that's kind of what I was feeling

00:28:01.420 --> 00:28:01.430
right that's kind of what I was feeling

I think that's actually what you're

I think that's actually what you're
going to want to do is make sure that

going to want to do is make sure that
 

00:34:14.659 --> 00:34:16.060
going to want to do is make sure that

automatically flip it there's some notes

00:36:03.720 --> 00:36:03.730
automatically flip it there's some notes
 

00:36:03.730 --> 00:36:05.130
automatically flip it there's some notes
about that in the documentation and I

00:36:05.130 --> 00:36:05.140
about that in the documentation and I
 

00:36:05.140 --> 00:36:06.570
about that in the documentation and I
don't believe there's a way to override

00:36:06.570 --> 00:36:06.580
don't believe there's a way to override
 

00:36:06.580 --> 00:36:08.970
don't believe there's a way to override
that behavior do you know of any damn no

00:36:08.970 --> 00:36:08.980
that behavior do you know of any damn no
 

00:36:08.980 --> 00:36:10.680
that behavior do you know of any damn no
I'm not that I hope I mean the easiest

00:36:10.680 --> 00:36:10.690
I'm not that I hope I mean the easiest
 

00:36:10.690 --> 00:36:12.510
I'm not that I hope I mean the easiest
thing to do of course is to implement a

00:36:12.510 --> 00:36:12.520
thing to do of course is to implement a
 

00:36:12.520 --> 00:36:16.109
thing to do of course is to implement a
matrix and matrix to unload it when you

00:36:16.109 --> 00:36:16.119
matrix and matrix to unload it when you
 

00:36:16.119 --> 00:36:17.670
matrix and matrix to unload it when you
are displaying it that's and that's

00:36:17.670 --> 00:36:17.680
are displaying it that's and that's
 

00:36:17.680 --> 00:36:20.030
are displaying it that's and that's
that's pretty straightforward the this

00:36:20.030 --> 00:36:20.040
that's pretty straightforward the this
 

00:36:20.040 --> 00:36:24.510
that's pretty straightforward the this
the second question is how do I draw

00:36:24.510 --> 00:36:24.520
the second question is how do I draw
 

00:36:24.520 --> 00:36:27.300
the second question is how do I draw
lines on to an image you and the answer

00:36:27.300 --> 00:36:27.310
lines on to an image you and the answer
 

00:36:27.310 --> 00:36:30.810
lines on to an image you and the answer
is you don't but what you can do is you

00:36:30.810 --> 00:36:30.820
is you don't but what you can do is you
 

00:36:30.820 --> 00:36:34.079
is you don't but what you can do is you
can actually take and create and create

00:36:34.079 --> 00:36:34.089
can actually take and create and create
 

00:36:34.089 --> 00:36:37.349
can actually take and create and create
a canvas that is using that image as its

00:36:37.349 --> 00:36:37.359
a canvas that is using that image as its
 

00:36:37.359 --> 00:36:39.750
a canvas that is using that image as its
base and then you can draw lines onto

00:36:39.750 --> 00:36:39.760
base and then you can draw lines onto
 

00:36:39.760 --> 00:36:42.599
base and then you can draw lines onto
that canvas and then you can put and

00:36:42.599 --> 00:36:42.609
that canvas and then you can put and
 

00:36:42.609 --> 00:36:44.640
that canvas and then you can put and
then you can get in that canvas clean

00:36:44.640 --> 00:36:44.650
then you can get in that canvas clean
 

00:36:44.650 --> 00:36:45.990
then you can get in that canvas clean
based on a bitmap and you can put that

00:36:45.990 --> 00:36:46.000
based on a bitmap and you can put that
 

00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:48.359
based on a bitmap and you can put that
bitmap back into an image view so that's

00:36:48.359 --> 00:36:48.369
bitmap back into an image view so that's
 

00:36:48.369 --> 00:36:49.589
bitmap back into an image view so that's
one way of doing it another way of

00:36:49.589 --> 00:36:49.599
one way of doing it another way of
 

00:36:49.599 --> 00:36:51.410
one way of doing it another way of
course is to create a custom control

00:36:51.410 --> 00:36:51.420
course is to create a custom control
 

00:36:51.420 --> 00:36:54.180
course is to create a custom control
that that is that you could derive from

00:36:54.180 --> 00:36:54.190
that that is that you could derive from
 

00:36:54.190 --> 00:36:56.010
that that is that you could derive from
image you and then I would be very

00:36:56.010 --> 00:36:56.020
image you and then I would be very
 

00:36:56.020 --> 00:36:58.410
image you and then I would be very
similar the only difference is you're

00:36:58.410 --> 00:36:58.420
similar the only difference is you're
 

00:36:58.420 --> 00:37:00.810
similar the only difference is you're
going to indy ondraw method you're going

00:37:00.810 --> 00:37:00.820
going to indy ondraw method you're going
 

00:37:00.820 --> 00:37:03.390
going to indy ondraw method you're going
to call the standard image use draw and

00:37:03.390 --> 00:37:03.400
to call the standard image use draw and
 

00:37:03.400 --> 00:37:05.460
to call the standard image use draw and
then you're going to then take that

00:37:05.460 --> 00:37:05.470
then you're going to then take that
 

00:37:05.470 --> 00:37:07.560
then you're going to then take that
canvas and draw whatever else you need

00:37:07.560 --> 00:37:07.570
canvas and draw whatever else you need

canvas and draw whatever else you need
on top of it so I think both of those

00:37:09.720 --> 00:37:09.730
on top of it so I think both of those
 

00:37:09.730 --> 00:37:11.400
on top of it so I think both of those
are our kind of reasonable approaches it

00:37:11.400 --> 00:37:11.410
are our kind of reasonable approaches it
 

00:37:11.410 --> 00:37:13.349
are our kind of reasonable approaches it

thing that's interesting to note about

00:37:14.460 --> 00:37:14.470
thing that's interesting to note about
 

00:37:14.470 --> 00:37:16.140

drawing lots and lots and lots of line

00:37:18.270 --> 00:37:18.280
drawing lots and lots and lots of line
 

00:37:18.280 --> 00:37:19.440

the built-in line drawing constructs you
 

00:37:26.819 --> 00:37:30.469

right you know it's helpful sometimes to
 

00:39:46.520 --> 00:39:48.070
right you know it's helpful sometimes to
have that custom view it again you could

00:39:48.070 --> 00:39:48.080
have that custom view it again you could
 

00:39:48.080 --> 00:39:49.870
have that custom view it again you could
have that image be a background for your

00:39:49.870 --> 00:39:49.880
have that image be a background for your
 

00:39:49.880 --> 00:39:51.730
have that image be a background for your
custom on you it doesn't even have to be

00:39:51.730 --> 00:39:51.740
custom on you it doesn't even have to be
 

00:39:51.740 --> 00:39:52.810
custom on you it doesn't even have to be
an image you it really depends on the

00:39:52.810 --> 00:39:52.820
an image you it really depends on the

an image you it really depends on the
kind of control you want to have over

00:39:54.940 --> 00:39:54.950
kind of control you want to have over
 

00:39:54.950 --> 00:39:56.230

and positioning you know then you might

00:40:02.320 --> 00:40:02.330
and positioning you know then you might
 

00:40:02.330 --> 00:40:04.390
and positioning you know then you might
want to base it on image you you've got

00:40:04.390 --> 00:40:04.400
want to base it on image you you've got
 

00:40:04.400 --> 00:40:07.800
want to base it on image you you've got
a lot of options though there okay um

00:40:07.800 --> 00:40:07.810

yeah yeah so basically the important

00:42:22.360 --> 00:42:22.370
yeah yeah so basically the important
 

00:42:22.370 --> 00:42:23.980
yeah yeah so basically the important
thing to know here is usually when users

00:42:23.980 --> 00:42:23.990
thing to know here is usually when users
 

00:42:23.990 --> 00:42:26.320
thing to know here is usually when users
get that error is one of two things and

00:42:26.320 --> 00:42:26.330
get that error is one of two things and
 

00:42:26.330 --> 00:42:29.200
get that error is one of two things and
the most common one almost always is it

00:42:29.200 --> 00:42:29.210
the most common one almost always is it
 

00:42:29.210 --> 00:42:30.310
the most common one almost always is it
just means that the user has been

00:42:30.310 --> 00:42:30.320
just means that the user has been
 

00:42:30.320 --> 00:42:32.130
just means that the user has been
flagged for additional risk review and

00:42:32.130 --> 00:42:32.140
flagged for additional risk review and
 

00:42:32.140 --> 00:42:35.650
flagged for additional risk review and
we have a roughly 30-second timeout for

we have a roughly 30-second timeout for

we have a roughly 30-second timeout for

00:42:37.600 --> 00:42:37.610
order to complete if it takes longer
 

00:42:37.610 --> 00:42:40.150
order to complete if it takes longer
than that Google Play will cancel the

00:42:40.150 --> 00:42:40.160
than that Google Play will cancel the
 

00:42:40.160 --> 00:42:42.640
than that Google Play will cancel the
order and the user will see that error

00:42:42.640 --> 00:42:42.650
order and the user will see that error
 

00:42:42.650 --> 00:42:44.530
order and the user will see that error

24 hours sometimes it's a lot quicker

00:42:52.720 --> 00:42:52.730
24 hours sometimes it's a lot quicker
 

00:42:52.730 --> 00:42:54.580
24 hours sometimes it's a lot quicker
sometimes it can take longer depends on

sometimes it can take longer depends on

sometimes it can take longer depends on
the individual circumstances the order

the individual circumstances the order

the individual circumstances the order
will go through basically we have to go

00:42:58.480 --> 00:42:58.490
will go through basically we have to go
 

00:42:58.490 --> 00:43:00.290
will go through basically we have to go
and vet that user and make sure that

00:43:00.290 --> 00:43:00.300
and vet that user and make sure that
 

00:43:00.300 --> 00:43:01.970
and vet that user and make sure that
the order isn't fraudulent we have a lot

00:43:01.970 --> 00:43:01.980
the order isn't fraudulent we have a lot
 

00:43:01.980 --> 00:43:04.340
the order isn't fraudulent we have a lot

if we have a machine learning-based to
 

00:43:04.350 --> 00:43:06.110
if we have a machine learning-based to

factors that go into the into our
 

00:43:07.560 --> 00:43:09.500
factors that go into the into our

at detecting when orders are fraudulent

00:43:11.540 --> 00:43:11.550
at detecting when orders are fraudulent
 

00:43:11.550 --> 00:43:13.460
at detecting when orders are fraudulent
a case you there's some false positives

00:43:13.460 --> 00:43:13.470
a case you there's some false positives
 

00:43:13.470 --> 00:43:15.530
a case you there's some false positives
and that's usually what you see here now

00:43:15.530 --> 00:43:15.540
and that's usually what you see here now
 

00:43:15.540 --> 00:43:17.480
and that's usually what you see here now
the other case is a case you there are

00:43:17.480 --> 00:43:17.490
the other case is a case you there are
 

00:43:17.490 --> 00:43:18.950
the other case is a case you there are
some technical issues like you know a

00:43:18.950 --> 00:43:18.960
some technical issues like you know a
 

00:43:18.960 --> 00:43:20.240
some technical issues like you know a

that time out this is rare but just so
you know of every now and then if

00:43:26.570 --> 00:43:26.580
you know of every now and then if
 

00:43:26.580 --> 00:43:28.310
you know of every now and then if
something like that does happen that can

00:43:28.310 --> 00:43:28.320
something like that does happen that can
 

00:43:28.320 --> 00:43:29.810
something like that does happen that can
cause a temporary spike in these error

00:43:29.810 --> 00:43:29.820

little bit later and it looked probably

00:43:35.630 --> 00:43:35.640
little bit later and it looked probably
 

00:43:35.640 --> 00:43:37.460
little bit later and it looked probably
and well it will go through if you try

00:43:37.460 --> 00:43:37.470
and well it will go through if you try
 

00:43:37.470 --> 00:43:41.870
and well it will go through if you try
it later so that's our advice again we

00:43:41.870 --> 00:43:41.880
it later so that's our advice again we
 

00:43:41.880 --> 00:43:44.720
it later so that's our advice again we
do take these errors really seriously we

00:43:44.720 --> 00:43:44.730
do take these errors really seriously we
 

00:43:44.730 --> 00:43:47.240
do take these errors really seriously we
handle it on a case-by-case basis and if

00:43:47.240 --> 00:43:47.250
handle it on a case-by-case basis and if
 

00:43:47.250 --> 00:43:49.220
handle it on a case-by-case basis and if
you do happen to see it feel free to

00:43:49.220 --> 00:43:49.230
you do happen to see it feel free to
 

00:43:49.230 --> 00:43:51.410
you do happen to see it feel free to
open up a ticket with Android developer

00:43:51.410 --> 00:43:51.420
open up a ticket with Android developer
 

00:43:51.420 --> 00:43:52.370
open up a ticket with Android developer

team going double check and see exactly

00:44:02.840 --> 00:44:02.850
team going double check and see exactly
 

00:44:02.850 --> 00:44:06.290
team going double check and see exactly
why that error happened and escalated to

00:44:06.290 --> 00:44:06.300
why that error happened and escalated to
 

00:44:06.300 --> 00:44:07.640
why that error happened and escalated to
our engineering teams if it's something

00:44:07.640 --> 00:44:07.650
our engineering teams if it's something
 

00:44:07.650 --> 00:44:11.900
our engineering teams if it's something
we haven't seen before okay it sounds

00:44:11.900 --> 00:44:11.910
we haven't seen before okay it sounds
 

00:44:11.910 --> 00:44:15.620
we haven't seen before okay it sounds
like the right thing to do next um we're

00:44:15.620 --> 00:44:15.630
like the right thing to do next um we're
 

00:44:15.630 --> 00:44:18.770
like the right thing to do next um we're
still okay on hang out correct alright

00:44:18.770 --> 00:44:18.780
still okay on hang out correct alright
 

00:44:18.780 --> 00:44:20.540
still okay on hang out correct alright
so next question from moderator I

00:44:20.540 --> 00:44:20.550
so next question from moderator I
 

00:44:20.550 --> 00:44:24.190
so next question from moderator I
develop OpenGL having an floating point

00:44:24.190 --> 00:44:24.200
develop OpenGL having an floating point
 

00:44:24.200 --> 00:44:26.810
develop OpenGL having an floating point
since the docs see the link say that

00:44:26.810 --> 00:44:26.820
since the docs see the link say that
 

00:44:26.820 --> 00:44:28.370
since the docs see the link say that
float and double or equivalent but

00:44:28.370 --> 00:44:28.380
float and double or equivalent but
 

00:44:28.380 --> 00:44:30.470
float and double or equivalent but
double is bigger why do you recommend

00:44:30.470 --> 00:44:30.480
double is bigger why do you recommend
 

00:44:30.480 --> 00:44:33.230
double is bigger why do you recommend
double anyway and so really we're really

00:44:33.230 --> 00:44:33.240
double anyway and so really we're really
 

00:44:33.240 --> 00:44:35.690
double anyway and so really we're really
talking about performance here you know

00:44:35.690 --> 00:44:35.700
talking about performance here you know
 

00:44:35.700 --> 00:44:38.030
talking about performance here you know
and so obviously there are cases in

00:44:38.030 --> 00:44:38.040
and so obviously there are cases in
 

00:44:38.040 --> 00:44:41.630
and so obviously there are cases in
which it's going to make a difference in

00:44:41.630 --> 00:44:41.640
which it's going to make a difference in
 

00:44:41.640 --> 00:44:43.310
which it's going to make a difference in
terms of performance to be setting a lot

00:44:43.310 --> 00:44:43.320
terms of performance to be setting a lot
 

00:44:43.320 --> 00:44:45.320
terms of performance to be setting a lot
less data is what happens if you're

00:44:45.320 --> 00:44:45.330
less data is what happens if you're
 

00:44:45.330 --> 00:44:47.840
less data is what happens if you're
sending you know single precision

00:44:47.840 --> 00:44:47.850
sending you know single precision
 

00:44:47.850 --> 00:44:49.790
sending you know single precision
floating point but there are times in

00:44:49.790 --> 00:44:49.800
floating point but there are times in
 

00:44:49.800 --> 00:44:52.270
floating point but there are times in
which having the additional fidelity of

00:44:52.270 --> 00:44:52.280
which having the additional fidelity of
 

00:44:52.280 --> 00:44:54.230
which having the additional fidelity of
actually having double precision is

00:44:54.230 --> 00:44:54.240
actually having double precision is
 

00:44:54.240 --> 00:44:56.780
actually having double precision is
going to make things look better I think

00:44:56.780 --> 00:44:56.790
going to make things look better I think
 

00:44:56.790 --> 00:44:59.360
going to make things look better I think
I think that in general what the doc is

00:44:59.360 --> 00:44:59.370
I think that in general what the doc is
 

00:44:59.370 --> 00:45:00.250
I think that in general what the doc is
trying to point out

00:45:00.250 --> 00:45:00.260
trying to point out
 

00:45:00.260 --> 00:45:02.500
trying to point out
is it because of the architecture of

00:45:02.500 --> 00:45:02.510
is it because of the architecture of
 

00:45:02.510 --> 00:45:07.030
is it because of the architecture of
modern CPUs you're really not going to

00:45:07.030 --> 00:45:07.040
modern CPUs you're really not going to
 

00:45:07.040 --> 00:45:09.700
modern CPUs you're really not going to
lose a substantial amount of performance

00:45:09.700 --> 00:45:09.710
lose a substantial amount of performance
 

00:45:09.710 --> 00:45:12.730
lose a substantial amount of performance
really any by going double most and

00:45:12.730 --> 00:45:12.740
really any by going double most and
 

00:45:12.740 --> 00:45:14.410
really any by going double most and
executed double essentially as quickly

00:45:14.410 --> 00:45:14.420
executed double essentially as quickly
 

00:45:14.420 --> 00:45:15.730
executed double essentially as quickly
if they execute a single precision

00:45:15.730 --> 00:45:15.740
if they execute a single precision
 

00:45:15.740 --> 00:45:19.810
if they execute a single precision
floating point you know a bit of

00:45:19.810 --> 00:45:19.820
floating point you know a bit of
 

00:45:19.820 --> 00:45:21.520
floating point you know a bit of
arithmetic i think that the trickier

00:45:21.520 --> 00:45:21.530
arithmetic i think that the trickier
 

00:45:21.530 --> 00:45:23.110
arithmetic i think that the trickier
part is whether or not you're gonna be

00:45:23.110 --> 00:45:23.120
part is whether or not you're gonna be
 

00:45:23.120 --> 00:45:25.150
part is whether or not you're gonna be
saturating memory bandwidth you know

00:45:25.150 --> 00:45:25.160
saturating memory bandwidth you know
 

00:45:25.160 --> 00:45:26.650
saturating memory bandwidth you know
what how much you how much memory you're

00:45:26.650 --> 00:45:26.660
what how much you how much memory you're
 

00:45:26.660 --> 00:45:28.390
what how much you how much memory you're
actually taking up all of these things

00:45:28.390 --> 00:45:28.400
actually taking up all of these things
 

00:45:28.400 --> 00:45:29.650
actually taking up all of these things
the other thing of course is when you're

00:45:29.650 --> 00:45:29.660
the other thing of course is when you're
 

00:45:29.660 --> 00:45:31.480
the other thing of course is when you're
actually getting into opengl into using

00:45:31.480 --> 00:45:31.490
actually getting into opengl into using
 

00:45:31.490 --> 00:45:34.240
actually getting into opengl into using
shaders on the other hand there is an

00:45:34.240 --> 00:45:34.250
shaders on the other hand there is an
 

00:45:34.250 --> 00:45:36.400
shaders on the other hand there is an
enormous difference between using low

00:45:36.400 --> 00:45:36.410
enormous difference between using low
 

00:45:36.410 --> 00:45:37.780
enormous difference between using low
medium and high precision within your

00:45:37.780 --> 00:45:37.790
medium and high precision within your
 

00:45:37.790 --> 00:45:40.000
medium and high precision within your
shaders so there is sort of there is a

00:45:40.000 --> 00:45:40.010
shaders so there is sort of there is a
 

00:45:40.010 --> 00:45:41.320
shaders so there is sort of there is a
kind of a second everything you're

00:45:41.320 --> 00:45:41.330
kind of a second everything you're
 

00:45:41.330 --> 00:45:43.690
kind of a second everything you're
talking about OpenGL and you're going to

00:45:43.690 --> 00:45:43.700
talking about OpenGL and you're going to
 

00:45:43.700 --> 00:45:45.220
talking about OpenGL and you're going to
be using low precision your shaders it

00:45:45.220 --> 00:45:45.230
be using low precision your shaders it
 

00:45:45.230 --> 00:45:46.870
be using low precision your shaders it
doesn't really make sense to be feeding

00:45:46.870 --> 00:45:46.880
doesn't really make sense to be feeding
 

00:45:46.880 --> 00:45:48.370
doesn't really make sense to be feeding
these things in with you know double

00:45:48.370 --> 00:45:48.380
these things in with you know double
 

00:45:48.380 --> 00:45:52.930
these things in with you know double
precision values necessarily but but in

00:45:52.930 --> 00:45:52.940
precision values necessarily but but in
 

00:45:52.940 --> 00:45:54.700
precision values necessarily but but in
general I think that you know the docket

00:45:54.700 --> 00:45:54.710
general I think that you know the docket
 

00:45:54.710 --> 00:45:56.230
general I think that you know the docket
is it just jumps simply saying that

00:45:56.230 --> 00:45:56.240
is it just jumps simply saying that
 

00:45:56.240 --> 00:45:59.340
is it just jumps simply saying that
floating point is is more expensive than

00:45:59.340 --> 00:45:59.350
floating point is is more expensive than
 

00:45:59.350 --> 00:46:02.170
floating point is is more expensive than
integer math and double precision

00:46:02.170 --> 00:46:02.180
integer math and double precision
 

00:46:02.180 --> 00:46:04.120
integer math and double precision
doesn't really cost you performance it

00:46:04.120 --> 00:46:04.130
doesn't really cost you performance it
 

00:46:04.130 --> 00:46:07.030
doesn't really cost you performance it
just costs to space and that's that's I

00:46:07.030 --> 00:46:07.040
just costs to space and that's that's I
 

00:46:07.040 --> 00:46:08.980
just costs to space and that's that's I
think that's really I think I think

00:46:08.980 --> 00:46:08.990
think that's really I think I think
 

00:46:08.990 --> 00:46:14.350
think that's really I think I think
that's pretty clear so okay all right

00:46:14.350 --> 00:46:14.360
that's pretty clear so okay all right
 

00:46:14.360 --> 00:46:20.630
that's pretty clear so okay all right
mm-hmm well i buy that answer yeah um

00:46:20.630 --> 00:46:20.640
mm-hmm well i buy that answer yeah um
 

00:46:20.640 --> 00:46:23.960
mm-hmm well i buy that answer yeah um

cases where to make sense to have it on
 

00:50:58.720 --> 00:51:00.930
cases where to make sense to have it on
to the other side from a technical

00:51:00.930 --> 00:51:00.940
to the other side from a technical
 

00:51:00.940 --> 00:51:03.210
to the other side from a technical
perspective we don't have anything as

00:51:03.210 --> 00:51:03.220
perspective we don't have anything as
 

00:51:03.220 --> 00:51:06.090
perspective we don't have anything as
part of the framework that would do this

00:51:06.090 --> 00:51:06.100
part of the framework that would do this
 

00:51:06.100 --> 00:51:08.550
part of the framework that would do this
for you so it's technically possible to

00:51:08.550 --> 00:51:08.560
for you so it's technically possible to
 

00:51:08.560 --> 00:51:10.620
for you so it's technically possible to
places on either side since you have to

00:51:10.620 --> 00:51:10.630
places on either side since you have to
 

00:51:10.630 --> 00:51:12.750
places on either side since you have to
write it from scratch yeah my feeling is

00:51:12.750 --> 00:51:12.760
write it from scratch yeah my feeling is
 

00:51:12.760 --> 00:51:14.940
write it from scratch yeah my feeling is
that since the overflow menu tends to

00:51:14.940 --> 00:51:14.950
that since the overflow menu tends to
 

00:51:14.950 --> 00:51:17.160
that since the overflow menu tends to
sit on the other side that it makes

00:51:17.160 --> 00:51:17.170
sit on the other side that it makes
 

00:51:17.170 --> 00:51:19.560
sit on the other side that it makes
sense to have this sort of functionality

00:51:19.560 --> 00:51:19.570
sense to have this sort of functionality
 

00:51:19.570 --> 00:51:21.390
sense to have this sort of functionality
opposite that but if there's a really

00:51:21.390 --> 00:51:21.400
opposite that but if there's a really
 

00:51:21.400 --> 00:51:23.400
opposite that but if there's a really
compelling reason in your UI and you

00:51:23.400 --> 00:51:23.410
compelling reason in your UI and you
 

00:51:23.410 --> 00:51:24.720
compelling reason in your UI and you
know you think you think you're breaking

00:51:24.720 --> 00:51:24.730
know you think you think you're breaking
 

00:51:24.730 --> 00:51:26.250
know you think you think you're breaking
new grounds I said there is no official

00:51:26.250 --> 00:51:26.260
new grounds I said there is no official
 

00:51:26.260 --> 00:51:29.400
new grounds I said there is no official
pattern on this so you know I think ltb

00:51:29.400 --> 00:51:29.410
pattern on this so you know I think ltb
 

00:51:29.410 --> 00:51:30.930
pattern on this so you know I think ltb
comes down to you know does it serve the

00:51:30.930 --> 00:51:30.940
comes down to you know does it serve the
 

00:51:30.940 --> 00:51:33.270
comes down to you know does it serve the
user well now the user is actually you

00:51:33.270 --> 00:51:33.280
user well now the user is actually you
 

00:51:33.280 --> 00:51:34.530
user well now the user is actually you
know has a whole bunch of established

00:51:34.530 --> 00:51:34.540
know has a whole bunch of established
 

00:51:34.540 --> 00:51:35.910
know has a whole bunch of established
applications that are doing it the other

00:51:35.910 --> 00:51:35.920
applications that are doing it the other
 

00:51:35.920 --> 00:51:37.290
applications that are doing it the other
way so I think you know it's certainly

00:51:37.290 --> 00:51:37.300
way so I think you know it's certainly
 

00:51:37.300 --> 00:51:39.180
way so I think you know it's certainly
worth considering you know whether or

00:51:39.180 --> 00:51:39.190
worth considering you know whether or
 

00:51:39.190 --> 00:51:41.280
worth considering you know whether or
not it's worth changing their

00:51:41.280 --> 00:51:41.290
not it's worth changing their
 

00:51:41.290 --> 00:51:44.370
not it's worth changing their
expectations in this way and that's what

00:51:44.370 --> 00:51:44.380
expectations in this way and that's what
 

00:51:44.380 --> 00:51:46.530
expectations in this way and that's what
ever we deviate from the pattern you

00:51:46.530 --> 00:51:46.540
ever we deviate from the pattern you
 

00:51:46.540 --> 00:51:47.130
ever we deviate from the pattern you
know I think

00:51:47.130 --> 00:51:47.140
know I think
 

00:51:47.140 --> 00:51:49.530
know I think
and for any one of our patterns whether

00:51:49.530 --> 00:51:49.540
and for any one of our patterns whether
 

00:51:49.540 --> 00:51:50.580
and for any one of our patterns whether
it's one of the ones we've actually

00:51:50.580 --> 00:51:50.590
it's one of the ones we've actually
 

00:51:50.590 --> 00:51:52.710
it's one of the ones we've actually
established or one of the are or one of

00:51:52.710 --> 00:51:52.720
established or one of the are or one of
 

00:51:52.720 --> 00:51:54.780
established or one of the are or one of
the ones that is sort of implied by the

00:51:54.780 --> 00:51:54.790
the ones that is sort of implied by the
 

00:51:54.790 --> 00:51:57.150
the ones that is sort of implied by the
ecosystem I think that it's always good

00:51:57.150 --> 00:51:57.160
ecosystem I think that it's always good
 

00:51:57.160 --> 00:51:58.380
ecosystem I think that it's always good
to look at the user and say was the

00:51:58.380 --> 00:51:58.390
to look at the user and say was the
 

00:51:58.390 --> 00:51:59.550
to look at the user and say was the
users what are the users expectations

00:51:59.550 --> 00:51:59.560
users what are the users expectations
 

00:51:59.560 --> 00:52:03.150
users what are the users expectations
and and why would does it mean a white

00:52:03.150 --> 00:52:03.160
and and why would does it mean a white
 

00:52:03.160 --> 00:52:05.010
and and why would does it mean a white
is changing this makes sense in terms of

00:52:05.010 --> 00:52:05.020
is changing this makes sense in terms of
 

00:52:05.020 --> 00:52:08.010
is changing this makes sense in terms of
their expectations right and is it you

00:52:08.010 --> 00:52:08.020
their expectations right and is it you
 

00:52:08.020 --> 00:52:09.630
their expectations right and is it you
know like Dan said most the time when

00:52:09.630 --> 00:52:09.640
know like Dan said most the time when
 

00:52:09.640 --> 00:52:11.670
know like Dan said most the time when
you see a draw on the left it's always

00:52:11.670 --> 00:52:11.680
you see a draw on the left it's always
 

00:52:11.680 --> 00:52:14.130
you see a draw on the left it's always
on the left on top of that also your up

00:52:14.130 --> 00:52:14.140
on the left on top of that also your up
 

00:52:14.140 --> 00:52:16.710
on the left on top of that also your up
button is always on the left and users

00:52:16.710 --> 00:52:16.720
button is always on the left and users
 

00:52:16.720 --> 00:52:18.390
button is always on the left and users
read left to right so I think those are

00:52:18.390 --> 00:52:18.400
read left to right so I think those are
 

00:52:18.400 --> 00:52:20.550
read left to right so I think those are
all really strong arguments for most the

00:52:20.550 --> 00:52:20.560
all really strong arguments for most the
 

00:52:20.560 --> 00:52:22.530
all really strong arguments for most the
time placing that drawer that slide

00:52:22.530 --> 00:52:22.540
time placing that drawer that slide
 

00:52:22.540 --> 00:52:27.000
time placing that drawer that slide
after all on the left ok in yeah the

00:52:27.000 --> 00:52:27.010
after all on the left ok in yeah the
 

00:52:27.010 --> 00:52:28.410
after all on the left ok in yeah the
only reason I was wondering that was

00:52:28.410 --> 00:52:28.420
only reason I was wondering that was
 

00:52:28.420 --> 00:52:32.010
only reason I was wondering that was
because I because some users like prefer

00:52:32.010 --> 00:52:32.020
because I because some users like prefer
 

00:52:32.020 --> 00:52:33.960
because I because some users like prefer
having actions on the right versus left

00:52:33.960 --> 00:52:33.970
having actions on the right versus left
 

00:52:33.970 --> 00:52:36.450
having actions on the right versus left
and that was the only that that's the

00:52:36.450 --> 00:52:36.460
and that was the only that that's the
 

00:52:36.460 --> 00:52:38.280
and that was the only that that's the
only reason that I thought that would

00:52:38.280 --> 00:52:38.290
only reason that I thought that would
 

00:52:38.290 --> 00:52:40.320
only reason that I thought that would
make sense ok also want to give the

00:52:40.320 --> 00:52:40.330
make sense ok also want to give the
 

00:52:40.330 --> 00:52:44.310
make sense ok also want to give the
onset yeah basically the comment was you

00:52:44.310 --> 00:52:44.320
onset yeah basically the comment was you
 

00:52:44.320 --> 00:52:46.140
onset yeah basically the comment was you
know some users might perform prefer

00:52:46.140 --> 00:52:46.150
know some users might perform prefer
 

00:52:46.150 --> 00:52:47.850
know some users might perform prefer
having action on the right versus the

00:52:47.850 --> 00:52:47.860
having action on the right versus the
 

00:52:47.860 --> 00:52:49.920
having action on the right versus the
left and that would be D the reason why

00:52:49.920 --> 00:52:49.930
left and that would be D the reason why
 

00:52:49.930 --> 00:52:51.960
left and that would be D the reason why
he was considering doing that yeah I I

00:52:51.960 --> 00:52:51.970
he was considering doing that yeah I I
 

00:52:51.970 --> 00:52:54.150
he was considering doing that yeah I I
think that that's something it's

00:52:54.150 --> 00:52:54.160
think that that's something it's
 

00:52:54.160 --> 00:52:56.790
think that that's something it's
definitely a valid point to consider but

00:52:56.790 --> 00:52:56.800
definitely a valid point to consider but
 

00:52:56.800 --> 00:52:58.110
definitely a valid point to consider but
again you have to wait with what the

00:52:58.110 --> 00:52:58.120
again you have to wait with what the
 

00:52:58.120 --> 00:52:59.730
again you have to wait with what the
rest of the ecosystem is doing and

00:52:59.730 --> 00:52:59.740
rest of the ecosystem is doing and
 

00:52:59.740 --> 00:53:02.310
rest of the ecosystem is doing and
what's familiar by users so it's a very

00:53:02.310 --> 00:53:02.320
what's familiar by users so it's a very
 

00:53:02.320 --> 00:53:04.770
what's familiar by users so it's a very
fine line there there's not a one

00:53:04.770 --> 00:53:04.780
fine line there there's not a one
 

00:53:04.780 --> 00:53:06.750
fine line there there's not a one
hundred percent correct answer but i'd

00:53:06.750 --> 00:53:06.760
hundred percent correct answer but i'd
 

00:53:06.760 --> 00:53:09.030
hundred percent correct answer but i'd
say like the ninety percent correct

00:53:09.030 --> 00:53:09.040
say like the ninety percent correct
 

00:53:09.040 --> 00:53:10.530
say like the ninety percent correct
answer is it should usually be on the

00:53:10.530 --> 00:53:10.540
answer is it should usually be on the
 

00:53:10.540 --> 00:53:12.540
answer is it should usually be on the
left I was yeah I was going to add that

00:53:12.540 --> 00:53:12.550
left I was yeah I was going to add that
 

00:53:12.550 --> 00:53:17.670
left I was yeah I was going to add that
um google TV for instance has a pattern

00:53:17.670 --> 00:53:17.680
um google TV for instance has a pattern
 

00:53:17.680 --> 00:53:20.370
um google TV for instance has a pattern
in which they replace the top action bar

00:53:20.370 --> 00:53:20.380
in which they replace the top action bar
 

00:53:20.380 --> 00:53:22.440
in which they replace the top action bar
with the side action bar and the side

00:53:22.440 --> 00:53:22.450
with the side action bar and the side
 

00:53:22.450 --> 00:53:25.200
with the side action bar and the side
action bars on the left just because TV

00:53:25.200 --> 00:53:25.210
action bars on the left just because TV
 

00:53:25.210 --> 00:53:29.300
action bars on the left just because TV
displays have a substantially different

00:53:29.300 --> 00:53:29.310
displays have a substantially different
 

00:53:29.310 --> 00:53:33.870
displays have a substantially different
aspect ratio and form than mobile device

00:53:33.870 --> 00:53:33.880
aspect ratio and form than mobile device
 

00:53:33.880 --> 00:53:36.910
aspect ratio and form than mobile device
displays and as I said they're the

00:53:36.910 --> 00:53:36.920
displays and as I said they're the
 

00:53:36.920 --> 00:53:40.500
displays and as I said they're the
this bar is on the left on and there's

00:53:40.500 --> 00:53:40.510
this bar is on the left on and there's
 

00:53:40.510 --> 00:53:44.350
this bar is on the left on and there's
no option is usually provided on going

00:53:44.350 --> 00:53:44.360
no option is usually provided on going
 

00:53:44.360 --> 00:53:46.720
no option is usually provided on going
to give us feedback then yeah no options

00:53:46.720 --> 00:53:46.730
to give us feedback then yeah no options
 

00:53:46.730 --> 00:53:48.430
to give us feedback then yeah no options
usually provided to move it to the right

00:53:48.430 --> 00:53:48.440
usually provided to move it to the right
 

00:53:48.440 --> 00:53:51.400
usually provided to move it to the right
i would say that your specific questions

00:53:51.400 --> 00:53:51.410
i would say that your specific questions
 

00:53:51.410 --> 00:53:53.290
i would say that your specific questions
about should it use the same pattern yes

00:53:53.290 --> 00:53:53.300
about should it use the same pattern yes
 

00:53:53.300 --> 00:53:55.300
about should it use the same pattern yes
should it stay on should there be an

00:53:55.300 --> 00:53:55.310
should it stay on should there be an
 

00:53:55.310 --> 00:53:57.730
should it stay on should there be an
option to move it to the right i would

00:53:57.730 --> 00:53:57.740
option to move it to the right i would
 

00:53:57.740 --> 00:53:59.620
option to move it to the right i would
say that it's not really necessary I

00:53:59.620 --> 00:53:59.630
say that it's not really necessary I
 

00:53:59.630 --> 00:54:02.410
say that it's not really necessary I
mean it's you know in general most users

00:54:02.410 --> 00:54:02.420
mean it's you know in general most users
 

00:54:02.420 --> 00:54:04.570
mean it's you know in general most users
don't need to have that sort of option

00:54:04.570 --> 00:54:04.580
don't need to have that sort of option
 

00:54:04.580 --> 00:54:08.050
don't need to have that sort of option
it's it's preferable to have and at a

00:54:08.050 --> 00:54:08.060
it's it's preferable to have and at a
 

00:54:08.060 --> 00:54:10.630
it's it's preferable to have and at a
consistent you I rather than one that's

00:54:10.630 --> 00:54:10.640
consistent you I rather than one that's
 

00:54:10.640 --> 00:54:14.460
consistent you I rather than one that's
infinitely malleable yeah you know I

00:54:14.460 --> 00:54:14.470
infinitely malleable yeah you know I
 

00:54:14.470 --> 00:54:17.620
infinitely malleable yeah you know I
obviously put I mean see see what see

00:54:17.620 --> 00:54:17.630
obviously put I mean see see what see
 

00:54:17.630 --> 00:54:18.850
obviously put I mean see see what see
what response right if you're getting a

00:54:18.850 --> 00:54:18.860
what response right if you're getting a
 

00:54:18.860 --> 00:54:20.380
what response right if you're getting a
lot of feedbacks hang one on the other

00:54:20.380 --> 00:54:20.390
lot of feedbacks hang one on the other
 

00:54:20.390 --> 00:54:22.240
lot of feedbacks hang one on the other
side then I would say go for it you know

00:54:22.240 --> 00:54:22.250
side then I would say go for it you know
 

00:54:22.250 --> 00:54:24.280
side then I would say go for it you know
because you know always ultimately you

00:54:24.280 --> 00:54:24.290
because you know always ultimately you
 

00:54:24.290 --> 00:54:26.830
because you know always ultimately you
want to listen to your users and not
