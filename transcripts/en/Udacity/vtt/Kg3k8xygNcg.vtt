00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Now, for this first option, I said it could support both of these theories.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
I could imagine a disk casting a circular shadow on the moon,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
and I could also imagine a sphere.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Now, if you chose sphere,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
you have a good reason to argue with me,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
because if the earth were disk-shaped,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
it would be a pretty huge coincidence

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
of the alignment of that disk

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
for it to actually cast a circular shadow.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
Think about this one a little more if that wasn't clear,

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
and we can talk about it in the forums.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.000
For the second point, when traveling at sea you can see farther from the top of the mast,

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:37.000
I said this definitely, definitely points to the earth being a sphere.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
Let's think about why.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
Here's my zoomed drawing of a portion of the earth,

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
and here's a boat--and exaggerated boat.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.000
It's much larger than any actual boat on the earth would be, but that's okay.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
In fact, this is a tool we're going to use a lot in physics.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.000
I exaggerate this drawing because I want to make a point clear.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
In my head when I'm thinking how a larger ship

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
may allow a person to see farther,

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
I'm going to exaggerate my test case in my head.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
Let's think of how far this guy could see--

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
the guy standing on the deck.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000
He could clearly see something down here, no problem.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000
He could see something over here. That's fine.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.000
But then this seems to be about as far as he can see.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000
He can never see something over here,

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000
because, well, the earth is in the way.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:28.000
Now, this sailor--she's standing up on the top of the boat.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000
This gives her a better angle and actually an unobstructed view towards

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000
this farther place on the earth.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000
This clearly points towards a spherical earth,

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.000
because on a flat disk-shaped earth, this wouldn't happen.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000
Actually, both sailors would be able to see anything.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000
The third option is about  the sun and the moon,

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000
but we're not talking about the sun and the moon.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
We're talking about the earth, so I don't think this is really relevant.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
Again, you can make some arguments about this

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.000
pointing towards sphere or disk and you should do that.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000
Go to the forums and talk about this point,

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000
but I thought the best answer was neither.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.000
This fourth point--that the sun appears lower in the sky as you travel north--

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.000
I say best supports that idea that the earth is a sphere.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.000
And let's talk about why.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.000
We'll, here's our spherical earth. Well, it's supposed to be spherical.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000
My drawing may not be the best you've ever seen.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000
And here's the sun.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.000
In reality, the sun is much, much, much larger than the earth,

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000
and it's much farther away.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000
For our purposes, this drawing will be fine.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000
First, let's imagine this guy.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000
He's standing pretty close to the equator.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.000
He's not very far north at all.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000
For him, if he wants to see the sun,

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.000
he can't be looking in this direction.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.000
he's got to look all the way up here.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000
He's going to have to really crane his neck

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000
if he wants to look at the sun.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000
We call this "high in the sky."

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:50.000
Now, let's imagine his friend--his green-haired northern-dwelling friend.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.000
Well, for her to look at the sun it's not very difficult at all.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000
She doesn't have to crane her neck.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:01.000
In fact, just from the geometry of where she's standing and the sun's position,

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:05.000
the sun appears very low in the sky to her.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.000
This would be really close to the horizon,

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000
and she doesn't have to crane her neck at all.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.000
This also points toward a spherical earth.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.000
You wouldn't see any effect like this on a flat earth.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.000
From the data we had or from the data the Greeks had,

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:24.000
some of it doesn't support either claim--the spherical or the disk hypothesis.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.000
But two of these points really seem to point towards a spherical earth.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000
None point towards a disk-shaped earth,

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.000
which means we can say with some certainty

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.000
that even with the knowledge that the Greeks had,

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.000
we can know that the earth is a sphere.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:41.000
Now, it's this last point--that the sun appears lower in the sky as we travel north

00:03:41.000 --> 99:59:59.000
that Eratosthenes will exploit to determine the circumference of the earth.
