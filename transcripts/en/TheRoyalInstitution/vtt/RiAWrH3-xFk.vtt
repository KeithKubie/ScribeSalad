00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.870
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:13.830
From the Royal Institution
in London, DemoJam.

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:17.910
Featuring designer of particle
accelerators, Suzie Sheehy.

00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:24.560
Vision researcher
and engineering

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:28.390
lecturer, Ben Craven.

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:31.820
Protein crystallographer,
Stephen Curry.

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:36.090
The UK's coolest science
teacher, Jonny Berliner.

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:39.180
And your host, formerly the
UK's coolest teacher, now

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:41.843
stand-up mathematician,
Matt Parker.

00:00:41.843 --> 00:00:42.316
Are we done?

00:00:42.316 --> 00:00:43.540
We're done.

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:44.020
All right.

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:47.820
Now, ever since we had DemoJam,
well, this means the

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:50.670
Royal Institution is no longer
just for Christmas.

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:51.090
Lectures?

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:51.390
Oh, no.

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:52.500
No, no.

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.950
We've invited our favourite
scientists from right across

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:57.890
the country to come in, flop
their favourite demos out on

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:00.200
the table, amaze
us, educate us.

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:02.570
Whatever they're going to do,
it's going to be thoroughly

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:03.970
good, geeky fun.

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:06.640
And to start us off, can we
please put our hands together

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:09.428
for our very first DemoJammer,
Dr. Suzie Sheehy.

00:01:12.182 --> 00:01:15.250
You would have seen one of these
Van de Graaff generators

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:16.600
when you were at school.

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:19.360
But if your school was anything
like mine, then once

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:22.510
a year, the thing got hauled
out, switched on, and

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:26.010
absolutely nothing happened.

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:29.750
Now, what's supposed to happen
is that the belt peels

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:34.360
electrons off the rollers, and
it builds up a positive static

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:36.970
charge on the top of the dome.

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:39.000
I've got a bunch of electrodes
which are hooked up

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.350
to the Van de Graff.

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:44.360
And when I switch it on, every
other electrode will become

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:46.110
positively charged.

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:50.140
And the rest of them will stay
at ground, or zero volts.

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:53.990
And my particle today is a
ping pong ball which I've

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:57.780
covered with a metallic paint
so it can hold a charge.

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:00.960
And when that sits on one of
the positive electrodes, it

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:03.640
becomes positively
charged itself.

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:05.930
And you should have learned,
around about the Van de Graaff

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:09.419
lesson in school, that
like charges repel.

00:02:09.419 --> 00:02:13.470
So it actually pushes away from
the positive electrode.

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:17.020
And then, when it sits on the
ground electrode, it loses all

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:19.620
of that charge and becomes
neutral again.

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:23.410
But it keeps rolling across to
the next positive electrode,

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:25.640
and the cycle repeats again.

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:27.830
And each time this happens,
it gains a

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:29.400
little bit of momentum.

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:32.526
So it gets faster and faster
and faster, if the Van de

00:02:32.526 --> 00:02:33.200
Graaff works.

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:36.450
So, if you'll all do me a favour
and just kind of will

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:39.815
it on with all of your will
power, I'll just switch it on.

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:49.440
It's all right.

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:51.600
You can breathe again now.

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:02.600
Now, it turns out, you can't
roll protons around in a salad

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:04.290
bowl, unfortunately.

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:07.270
You need to actually put them
in an ultra-high vacuum and

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:09.350
then use magnetic fields
to actually bend

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:11.280
them around in a circle.

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:17.535
Now, it also turns out that
a real proton is about 200

00:03:17.535 --> 00:03:21.115
trillion times smaller than
a ping pong ball.

00:03:21.115 --> 00:03:23.490
And it can't change
its charge.

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:26.190
So we've made a bit of a cheat
here, because we've kept the

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:28.190
electric field constant.

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:31.020
In a real accelerator, you have
to change the electric

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:34.670
field to keep accelerating
the particle around.

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:37.480
And you have to do it
pretty quickly.

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:40.830
Because the protons in the Large
Hadron Collider, well,

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:44.320
they're traveling at just
a tiny fraction below

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:45.630
the speed of light.

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:53.780
And the speed of light is
299,792,458 meters a second.

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:56.960
So, keeping that in time with
increasing speed of the

00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:59.900
particles is pretty tricky.

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:02.750
And we're not just talking
about one particle.

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:05.640
We actually accelerate billions
or even trillions of

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:07.850
them all at the same time.

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:10.430
And they all have the same
electric charge, so they all

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:12.460
try and repel against
each other.

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:16.690
And trust me, that causes all
sorts of other problems.

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:20.869
So, as models go, this one is
a little bit simplified.

00:04:20.869 --> 00:04:23.950
But there's two things about
real accelerators that this

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:26.440
can actually show us.

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:30.250
The first one is looking at
the shape of the bowl, the

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:33.430
curved shape, that's actually
quite similar to the way we

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:35.640
shape the magnetic field
in the type of

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:37.420
accelerator that I work on.

00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:40.120
And if you guys want to google
it later, it's called a

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:42.590
Nonlinear Non-scaling
Fixed-Field Alternating

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:45.510
Gradient Accelerator.

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:47.780
Now the other thing which
relates to real particle

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:50.790
accelerators is the
power source.

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:54.000
Accelerators based on this Van
de Graaff principle were

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.320
actually the cornerstone
of nuclear physics

00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:58.340
research for decades.

00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:01.510
And my first publication, which
was in nuclear physics,

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:03.950
used a Van de Graaff
accelerator.

00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:08.150
So to me, the Van de Graaff
isn't just an unreliable,

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:10.130
useless classroom
demonstration.

00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:13.150
It's a reminder of how the
development of particle

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:16.830
accelerator technology has
fundamentally changed the way

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:19.422
that we understand the
world around us.

00:05:19.422 --> 00:05:21.170
Ladies and gentlemen,
Dr. Suzie Sheehy!

00:05:21.170 --> 00:05:27.888
[APPLAUSE]

00:05:27.888 --> 00:05:29.800
That's fantastic.

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:33.370
We give you the Small
Hadron colander.

00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:35.890
Now, if you're at home watching
this from the comfort

00:05:35.890 --> 00:05:38.960
of your own computer, you might
think that DemoJam,

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:42.810
well, you think it's a short,
concise, fun evening.

00:05:42.810 --> 00:05:43.380
Oh, no.

00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:44.140
It's not.

00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:47.730
We just edit it to make it look
like it's short and fun.

00:05:47.730 --> 00:05:51.360
In reality, the show takes lots
of long, tedious breaks

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:54.150
while we set up for
the next shot.

00:05:54.150 --> 00:05:57.650
So to avoid the audience
becoming too, well, irate, we

00:05:57.650 --> 00:06:00.310
give them some busy work.

00:06:00.310 --> 00:06:04.030
We're going to issue everyone
with two Styrofoam cups and

00:06:04.030 --> 00:06:07.640
some elastic bands, and we'll
come back later in the show to

00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:09.310
see what they're going
to make of them.

00:06:09.310 --> 00:06:12.130
Now, however, can we get ready
for our next DemoJammer.

00:06:12.130 --> 00:06:14.290
Put your hands together
for Dr. Ben Craven.

00:06:14.290 --> 00:06:18.990
[MUSIC PLAYS]

00:06:18.990 --> 00:06:21.490
In a moment, down here,
I'm going to show

00:06:21.490 --> 00:06:23.090
you a little square.

00:06:23.090 --> 00:06:26.440
And what I want you to do is to
tell me, in one word, your

00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:28.930
first impression, what colour
that square is.

00:06:28.930 --> 00:06:29.750
So here goes.

00:06:29.750 --> 00:06:31.500
Call it out.

00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:32.810
White.

00:06:32.810 --> 00:06:33.000
OK.

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:34.330
So you think that one's white.

00:06:34.330 --> 00:06:36.868
Well how about this one?

00:06:36.868 --> 00:06:37.800
White.

00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:38.230
White.

00:06:38.230 --> 00:06:39.340
Even whiter.

00:06:39.340 --> 00:06:41.760
So maybe the first one
is not as white as

00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:42.810
you thought it was.

00:06:42.810 --> 00:06:46.330
Well, if that second one is
white, look at that one.

00:06:46.330 --> 00:06:46.970
Okay.

00:06:46.970 --> 00:06:48.090
That's really white.

00:06:48.090 --> 00:06:51.440
And so white that we're having
to adjust the camera to take

00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:52.410
account of it.

00:06:52.410 --> 00:06:54.730
So, do you think that third
one is definitely white?

00:06:54.730 --> 00:06:55.200
Yes.

00:06:55.200 --> 00:06:56.830
Are you absolutely certain
it's white?

00:06:56.830 --> 00:06:57.850
Well, look.

00:06:57.850 --> 00:06:59.830
There's the white one.

00:06:59.830 --> 00:07:01.780
Now, see this first one
you were looking at.

00:07:01.780 --> 00:07:03.560
What color do you think
that is now?

00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:04.440
Grey.

00:07:04.440 --> 00:07:04.925
It's grey, right?

00:07:04.925 --> 00:07:10.460
Let's take the lights up and
see what it really is.

00:07:10.460 --> 00:07:11.980
What colour is it?

00:07:11.980 --> 00:07:12.520
Black.

00:07:12.520 --> 00:07:14.700
Now, a couple of minutes ago,
you were telling me

00:07:14.700 --> 00:07:16.170
that that was white.

00:07:16.170 --> 00:07:18.600
Now you're telling me
that it's black.

00:07:18.600 --> 00:07:19.620
So let's see what's going on.

00:07:19.620 --> 00:07:23.610
Let's have the lights
back, please.

00:07:23.610 --> 00:07:26.140
I was actually giving your brain
a very, very difficult

00:07:26.140 --> 00:07:27.010
task to do here.

00:07:27.010 --> 00:07:29.100
This square is emitting
a certain amount of

00:07:29.100 --> 00:07:30.240
light into your eye.

00:07:30.240 --> 00:07:32.960
Now you're in a dark room, and
this is probably the brightest

00:07:32.960 --> 00:07:34.510
thing you can see.

00:07:34.510 --> 00:07:37.290
And so, your brain made the
perfectly reasonable guess

00:07:37.290 --> 00:07:40.370
that this was a light thing
in a dark place.

00:07:40.370 --> 00:07:42.760
But what the visual part of your
brain didn't know about

00:07:42.760 --> 00:07:46.025
was the very bright light
inside the box.

00:07:46.025 --> 00:07:49.510
And what it was actually looking
at was a piece of wood

00:07:49.510 --> 00:07:52.140
painted black in a very
bright place.

00:07:52.140 --> 00:07:53.240
I'm going to do a little
survey now.

00:07:53.240 --> 00:07:57.890
Has anybody seen this effect
before, this demonstration?

00:07:57.890 --> 00:08:00.110
A handful of people have.
Most of you haven't.

00:08:00.110 --> 00:08:02.090
Well I'm sorry to say that most
of you are completely

00:08:02.090 --> 00:08:06.100
wrong, because you've seen it
hundreds of times before.

00:08:06.100 --> 00:08:08.230
When you look up at the moon
in the sky, it feels like

00:08:08.230 --> 00:08:09.780
you're looking at a
light object, a

00:08:09.780 --> 00:08:10.680
light-coloured object.

00:08:10.680 --> 00:08:13.400
We make jokes about the moon
being made of cheese.

00:08:13.400 --> 00:08:15.435
In fact, if I had a
piece of moon rock

00:08:15.435 --> 00:08:16.470
here, it would be dark.

00:08:16.470 --> 00:08:18.460
It would be something like the
surface of a road or a piece

00:08:18.460 --> 00:08:19.560
of dark slate.

00:08:19.560 --> 00:08:21.680
When you look at the moon,
you're not looking at a light

00:08:21.680 --> 00:08:23.090
object in a dark place.

00:08:23.090 --> 00:08:25.880
You're looking at a dark object
in a very bright place.

00:08:25.880 --> 00:08:28.120
Because the sun is shining very
brightly on the moon.

00:08:28.120 --> 00:08:31.870
So next time you look up at the
moon in the sky, I want

00:08:31.870 --> 00:08:33.919
you to try and convince yourself
that you really are

00:08:33.919 --> 00:08:36.330
looking at a dark object
in a bright place.

00:08:36.330 --> 00:08:38.510
I've been trying for years,
and I've never succeeded.

00:08:38.510 --> 00:08:40.460
So I hope you'll have better
luck than I do.

00:08:40.460 --> 00:08:40.929
Thank you.

00:08:46.370 --> 00:08:47.500
Wow, that really is
mind boggling.

00:08:47.500 --> 00:08:49.260
And, actually, do you mind
if we have a look?

00:08:49.260 --> 00:08:51.280
if you come in here,
right, you can see.

00:08:51.280 --> 00:08:53.990
It really is that there's a
bathroom light and then just

00:08:53.990 --> 00:08:56.620
some poorly painted
bits of wood.

00:08:56.620 --> 00:08:58.050
That is absolutely brilliant.

00:08:58.050 --> 00:09:00.690
And thankfully, because of this
bit of equipment, we now

00:09:00.690 --> 00:09:04.380
finally have scientific proof
of the Jackson conjecture,

00:09:04.380 --> 00:09:08.920
which states, it don't matter
if you're black or white or

00:09:08.920 --> 00:09:11.140
some kind of intermediate
stage.

00:09:11.140 --> 00:09:11.660
Anyway.

00:09:11.660 --> 00:09:14.340
Now DemoJam would like to
welcome along Professor

00:09:14.340 --> 00:09:16.930
Stephen Curry for a little
fireside chat.

00:09:16.930 --> 00:09:17.427
[APPLAUSE]

00:09:17.427 --> 00:09:18.918
[MUSIC PLAYS]

00:09:18.918 --> 00:09:22.641
For which I need to
be over there.

00:09:22.641 --> 00:09:24.510
And now I'm over here.

00:09:24.510 --> 00:09:26.980
I'm joined by Professor Stephen
Curry, who is a

00:09:26.980 --> 00:09:30.770
structural biologist. And you
work on the somewhat dangerous

00:09:30.770 --> 00:09:32.130
foot and mouth virus.

00:09:32.130 --> 00:09:32.420
Yes.

00:09:32.420 --> 00:09:32.855
That's right.

00:09:32.855 --> 00:09:35.160
And that does sound
very dangerous.

00:09:35.160 --> 00:09:37.540
Do you actually get
to use the virus?

00:09:37.540 --> 00:09:39.320
No, I work in a laboratory
in London.

00:09:39.320 --> 00:09:42.330
We are not allowed, by law, to
use the virus because it's so

00:09:42.330 --> 00:09:43.450
contagious.

00:09:43.450 --> 00:09:46.250
And we only work on small
fragments from the virus.

00:09:46.250 --> 00:09:47.280
So you get, like,
a little bit?

00:09:47.280 --> 00:09:48.030
We do, yes.

00:09:48.030 --> 00:09:49.160
Like, just the foot?

00:09:49.160 --> 00:09:52.260
Not quite the foot, but we
work on proteins that the

00:09:52.260 --> 00:09:54.420
virus makes inside
the cell during

00:09:54.420 --> 00:09:55.310
the course of infection.

00:09:55.310 --> 00:09:55.705
OK, OK.

00:09:55.705 --> 00:09:57.440
So you get a safe
bit to look at.

00:09:57.440 --> 00:09:58.480
It's entirely safe.

00:09:58.480 --> 00:09:59.390
You've brought in a virus.

00:09:59.390 --> 00:10:02.040
And we couldn't bring in foot
and mouth, I'm afraid.

00:10:02.040 --> 00:10:05.300
But here we have, now,
who is this guy?

00:10:05.300 --> 00:10:07.515
Well, this is actually a kissing
cousin of foot and

00:10:07.515 --> 00:10:08.280
mouth disease virus.

00:10:08.280 --> 00:10:11.500
This is actually the human rhino
virus, which causes the

00:10:11.500 --> 00:10:12.270
common cold.

00:10:12.270 --> 00:10:13.040
That's the common cold.

00:10:13.040 --> 00:10:13.370
Right.

00:10:13.370 --> 00:10:16.360
Now, how accurate
is this model?

00:10:16.360 --> 00:10:17.720
Well, this is a child's toy.

00:10:17.720 --> 00:10:19.190
So it's not entirely accurate.

00:10:19.190 --> 00:10:24.690
The real virus has no eyes, is
not covered in soft blue fur.

00:10:24.690 --> 00:10:26.640
It's nowhere near as adorable.

00:10:26.640 --> 00:10:29.320
I'm afraid not.

00:10:29.320 --> 00:10:31.790
But it is still an educational
aid to some extent, right?

00:10:31.790 --> 00:10:32.140
It is.

00:10:32.140 --> 00:10:35.040
There is one feature which is
quite anatomically correct.

00:10:35.040 --> 00:10:37.390
And that you can see on this
end of the virus, which is

00:10:37.390 --> 00:10:40.225
that it has a five-fold symmetry
axis, which means

00:10:40.225 --> 00:10:43.350
that if we rotate it 1/5
of a turn, then the

00:10:43.350 --> 00:10:44.840
virus looks the same.

00:10:44.840 --> 00:10:46.390
How do we actually
know any of that?

00:10:46.390 --> 00:10:49.390
I mean, how do we know it's
shaped like an icosahedron?

00:10:49.390 --> 00:10:50.340
Well, that's a good question.

00:10:50.340 --> 00:10:52.900
Because this toy is actually
quite a bit bigger than the

00:10:52.900 --> 00:10:53.510
real thing.

00:10:53.510 --> 00:10:56.350
In fact, it's about 3 million
times larger than

00:10:56.350 --> 00:10:57.110
a real rhino virus.

00:10:57.110 --> 00:10:57.490
That's not bad.

00:10:57.490 --> 00:10:58.630
That's better than the
proton we had.

00:10:58.630 --> 00:10:59.380
Indeed.

00:10:59.380 --> 00:11:02.990
But even so, it's too small to
see by eye, and it's too small

00:11:02.990 --> 00:11:05.980
even to see with our very
best light microscopes.

00:11:05.980 --> 00:11:09.510
You can get a fuzzy image with
an electron microscope, but if

00:11:09.510 --> 00:11:12.010
you really want to see the
atomic details, which is what

00:11:12.010 --> 00:11:14.890
I'm interested in, then you have
to use a technique called

00:11:14.890 --> 00:11:16.420
X-ray crystallography.

00:11:16.420 --> 00:11:20.290
And for X-ray crystallography,
you need X-rays

00:11:20.290 --> 00:11:22.320
and you need a crystal.

00:11:22.320 --> 00:11:23.380
I happen to have a crystal -

00:11:23.380 --> 00:11:23.470
It's all there in the title...

00:11:23.470 --> 00:11:23.560
- here.

00:11:23.560 --> 00:11:25.640
Oh, yes.

00:11:25.640 --> 00:11:28.120
So, this is a crystal
of quartz.

00:11:28.120 --> 00:11:29.840
So it's not a crystal
of rhino virus.

00:11:29.840 --> 00:11:31.870
You are all perfectly safe.

00:11:31.870 --> 00:11:35.300
And what's interesting about a
crystal is that inside the

00:11:35.300 --> 00:11:39.080
crystal, all the atoms are
lined up in orderly rows.

00:11:39.080 --> 00:11:43.748
But the virus is not a cuddly
toy, but it's not a crystal

00:11:43.748 --> 00:11:44.260
either, is it?

00:11:44.260 --> 00:11:44.790
No, it's not.

00:11:44.790 --> 00:11:47.760
But if we grow up a few
milligrams of rhino virus,

00:11:47.760 --> 00:11:50.390
there are techniques which will
allow us to induce them

00:11:50.390 --> 00:11:52.690
to stick together in an orderly
form that makes a

00:11:52.690 --> 00:11:53.960
crystal of rhino viruses.

00:11:53.960 --> 00:11:56.740
Right, so you get crystallized
virus.

00:11:56.740 --> 00:11:57.270
Yep.

00:11:57.270 --> 00:11:58.450
And then the fun begins.

00:11:58.450 --> 00:11:58.890
Yes.

00:11:58.890 --> 00:12:00.700
So, a crystallized rhino virus
would actually be an awful lot

00:12:00.700 --> 00:12:01.930
smaller than this.

00:12:01.930 --> 00:12:04.550
But the interesting thing about
the crystalline form of

00:12:04.550 --> 00:12:08.210
matter is that if you shine
X-rays through it, then it

00:12:08.210 --> 00:12:10.800
diffracts that X-ray off in
hundreds of different

00:12:10.800 --> 00:12:11.460
directions.

00:12:11.460 --> 00:12:14.570
So you put X-rays through
the lattice.

00:12:14.570 --> 00:12:14.950
They get diffracted.

00:12:14.950 --> 00:12:17.380
And you get your diffraction
pattern, over

00:12:17.380 --> 00:12:18.740
on a screen or something.

00:12:18.740 --> 00:12:19.320
That's right.

00:12:19.320 --> 00:12:22.510
And then, that's not a picture
of the structure, but you can

00:12:22.510 --> 00:12:25.230
work back, I believe,
mathematically, from the

00:12:25.230 --> 00:12:27.740
structure that you see here to
the atoms that must have

00:12:27.740 --> 00:12:28.830
caused that.

00:12:28.830 --> 00:12:29.540
Yes, that's right.

00:12:29.540 --> 00:12:31.260
So, we get spots
on a detector.

00:12:31.260 --> 00:12:34.220
But in those spots is all the
information we need, thanks to

00:12:34.220 --> 00:12:35.475
Fourier's transform,
to reconstruct -

00:12:35.475 --> 00:12:36.500
I'm a big fan.

00:12:36.500 --> 00:12:38.280
- To reconstruct the structure
of the virus.

00:12:38.280 --> 00:12:40.880
And what's interesting about
that is that Fourier was a

00:12:40.880 --> 00:12:43.270
French mathematician from
the nineteenth century.

00:12:43.270 --> 00:12:45.750
He died, unfortunately, before
the X-ray was even discovered,

00:12:45.750 --> 00:12:47.360
before the virus was
even discovered.

00:12:47.360 --> 00:12:48.120
Why was he doing it?

00:12:48.120 --> 00:12:50.510
Because he was interested in
the transport of heat.

00:12:50.510 --> 00:12:53.260
He was interested in how fast
does it take heat to get from

00:12:53.260 --> 00:12:55.906
one end of a hot poker
to the other?

00:12:55.906 --> 00:12:57.000
Hot poker research.

00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:58.100
Right, now.

00:12:58.100 --> 00:12:58.680
You do all this.

00:12:58.680 --> 00:13:00.040
You do the X-ray diffraction.

00:13:00.040 --> 00:13:00.610
You work back.

00:13:00.610 --> 00:13:02.060
You get the structure.

00:13:02.060 --> 00:13:04.680
Now, I assume we're using
that to somehow

00:13:04.680 --> 00:13:06.200
combat these viruses.

00:13:06.200 --> 00:13:06.550
Yes.

00:13:06.550 --> 00:13:10.320
So, if we can see the detail
structure, so the results we

00:13:10.320 --> 00:13:11.910
get are much more detailed
than this.

00:13:11.910 --> 00:13:15.850
We can see where every atom is
in the virus, and that gives

00:13:15.850 --> 00:13:19.620
us a really detailed
understanding of how the virus

00:13:19.620 --> 00:13:22.690
interacts with the cell, how
it uncoats, and the things

00:13:22.690 --> 00:13:24.560
that it does inside a cell
to cause infection.

00:13:24.560 --> 00:13:29.530
So if you understand how the
virus works, then it gives you

00:13:29.530 --> 00:13:31.240
a way to develop drugs
in order to stop it.

00:13:31.240 --> 00:13:34.150
So why have we not got a cure
to the common cold?

00:13:34.150 --> 00:13:36.900
Well, the common cold,
fortunately for us, isn't a

00:13:36.900 --> 00:13:37.920
terribly serious disease -

00:13:37.920 --> 00:13:38.830
It is for me.

00:13:38.830 --> 00:13:41.900
- By the time you develop
symptoms, you're more or less

00:13:41.900 --> 00:13:44.100
halfway on the way to a cure.

00:13:44.100 --> 00:13:45.470
So you're going to get
better anyway.

00:13:45.470 --> 00:13:45.910
That's right, yes.

00:13:45.910 --> 00:13:48.820
So all we get from knowing the
structure of the common cold

00:13:48.820 --> 00:13:52.640
viruses is we can make slightly
accurate toys.

00:13:52.640 --> 00:13:53.110
So if I -

00:13:53.110 --> 00:13:54.130
You could say that, yes.

00:13:54.130 --> 00:13:56.670
If you get ill, you can curl up
in bed and cuddle the virus

00:13:56.670 --> 00:13:58.730
that is currently
infecting you.

00:13:58.730 --> 00:14:00.470
That's just great.

00:14:00.470 --> 00:14:02.890
Anyway, all the best with
foot and mouth,

00:14:02.890 --> 00:14:04.270
which is a great sentence.

00:14:04.270 --> 00:14:06.640
Can we have a final round of
applause for Stephen Curry?

00:14:06.640 --> 00:14:09.590
[APPLAUSE]

00:14:09.590 --> 00:14:09.860
Right.

00:14:09.860 --> 00:14:13.400
Now that we're pretty much at
the end of DemoJam, we should

00:14:13.400 --> 00:14:15.960
check back in with our audience
to see what they did

00:14:15.960 --> 00:14:16.780
with those cups.

00:14:16.780 --> 00:14:20.110
So they all have made Bernoulli
cups out of them.

00:14:20.110 --> 00:14:22.280
So let's see how this goes.

00:14:27.510 --> 00:14:29.630
Spectacular, it turns out.

00:14:29.630 --> 00:14:32.340
If you're wondering how to make
your own Bernoulli cup at

00:14:32.340 --> 00:14:34.510
home, then beneath me somewhere
is an information

00:14:34.510 --> 00:14:36.700
box which you've already
clicked.

00:14:36.700 --> 00:14:39.900
You can find out how to build
your own, successfully.

00:14:39.900 --> 00:14:43.150
However, given that this is
the scientific process, we

00:14:43.150 --> 00:14:46.060
need to end properly
with a conclusion.

00:14:46.060 --> 00:14:48.660
And because we are the Royal
Institution here, we should do

00:14:48.660 --> 00:14:49.990
it in an orthodox,

00:14:49.990 --> 00:14:52.090
scientifically accurate method.

00:14:52.090 --> 00:14:54.490
Which is, of course,
through song.

00:14:54.490 --> 00:14:57.434
Ladies and gentleman,
Jonny Berliner.

00:14:57.434 --> 00:15:08.400
[MUSIC BEGINS]

00:15:08.400 --> 00:15:11.930
When I look at the world, it's
all black and white.

00:15:11.930 --> 00:15:14.390
Like the black of the
sky and the white

00:15:14.390 --> 00:15:16.130
of the moon at night.

00:15:16.130 --> 00:15:18.520
But it's more than the
wavelength of the ray that

00:15:18.520 --> 00:15:20.010
gives me sight.

00:15:20.010 --> 00:15:23.610
It's the way that my brain
interprets the light.

00:15:23.610 --> 00:15:26.200
But the colour of the moon's
not black or white.

00:15:26.200 --> 00:15:27.480
It's in between.

00:15:27.480 --> 00:15:29.910
And it's a matter of
psychology why

00:15:29.910 --> 00:15:31.890
it couldn't be seen.

00:15:31.890 --> 00:15:33.880
It couldn't be seen.

00:15:33.880 --> 00:15:35.140
It couldn't be seen.

00:15:35.140 --> 00:15:39.260
No, the colour of the moon,
it couldn't be seen.

00:15:39.260 --> 00:15:41.380
I got a cold.

00:15:41.380 --> 00:15:43.330
It hurt a lot.

00:15:43.330 --> 00:15:45.640
I wanted to see the
rhino virus that

00:15:45.640 --> 00:15:47.622
was causing the snot.

00:15:47.622 --> 00:15:49.400
Looked under a microscope.

00:15:49.400 --> 00:15:51.580
Nothing to see.

00:15:51.580 --> 00:15:55.720
So I tried my hand at
crystallography.

00:15:55.720 --> 00:15:57.540
Got a pattern of dots.

00:15:57.540 --> 00:16:01.010
Didn't know what they mean
without Fourier analysis, the

00:16:01.010 --> 00:16:03.800
icosahedron couldn't be seen.

00:16:03.800 --> 00:16:05.760
It couldn't be seen.

00:16:05.760 --> 00:16:07.950
It couldn't be seen.

00:16:07.950 --> 00:16:11.210
No, the icosahedral structure
of the rhino virus, it

00:16:11.210 --> 00:16:12.120
couldn't be seen.

00:16:12.120 --> 00:16:36.510
[MUSIC PLAYS]

00:16:36.510 --> 00:16:41.440
Now Mr. Van de Graaff would be
overjoyed to see his machine

00:16:41.440 --> 00:16:43.260
spin a ping pong ball around
a custom blown

00:16:43.260 --> 00:16:44.810
acrylic oblate spheroid.

00:16:44.810 --> 00:16:49.720
He'd be even happier that his
technology can generate the

00:16:49.720 --> 00:16:52.850
protons for the LHC.

00:16:52.850 --> 00:16:56.430
That we accelerate and collide
with energy and find

00:16:56.430 --> 00:17:00.510
fundamental particles that
couldn't be seen.

00:17:00.510 --> 00:17:02.220
They couldn't be seen.

00:17:02.220 --> 00:17:03.715
They couldn't be seen.

00:17:03.715 --> 00:17:07.640
No, the fundamental particles,
they couldn't be seen.

00:17:07.640 --> 00:17:08.664
They couldn't be seen.

00:17:08.664 --> 00:17:10.592
They couldn't be seen.

00:17:10.592 --> 00:17:12.556
They couldn't be seen.

00:17:24.340 --> 00:17:24.666
Jonny Berliner!

00:17:24.666 --> 00:17:26.429
And that, ladies and gentlemen,
is DemoJam.
