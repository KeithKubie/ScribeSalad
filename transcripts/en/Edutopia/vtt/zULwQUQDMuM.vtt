00:00:07.056 --> 00:00:08.606
&gt;&gt;Cheryl: Research shows that if
the student's in the right mindset

00:00:08.606 --> 00:00:11.246
and they get their sensory needs met,

00:00:11.576 --> 00:00:13.316
they're going to be much
better learners.

00:00:13.566 --> 00:00:17.426
So after the sensory room,
they're able to focus more,

00:00:17.846 --> 00:00:22.106
they're able to learn easier, and
they retain more information, I find.

00:00:22.876 --> 00:00:26.226
&gt;&gt;Heather: Hands to your heart space.

00:00:26.226 --> 00:00:27.726
Take a deep breath in.

00:00:28.226 --> 00:00:28.776
[ inhales, exhales ]

00:00:37.206 --> 00:00:40.216
&gt;&gt;Patricia: The children should
be and deserve to be educated

00:00:40.496 --> 00:00:43.416
within their district and
within their school community.

00:00:43.416 --> 00:00:48.466
In Meriden, we have approximately
twelve hundred students

00:00:48.466 --> 00:00:51.286
who have individualized
educational plans.

00:00:51.556 --> 00:00:56.026
Students with vision difficulties,
language difficulties, autism.

00:00:56.376 --> 00:01:00.636
&gt;&gt;Jennifer: So here at Hanover School,
we have our STARS autism program,

00:01:00.636 --> 00:01:05.226
and STARS stands for Students and
Teachers Achieving Remarkable Success.

00:01:05.806 --> 00:01:10.126
&gt;&gt;Cheryl: So River, what did we do
yesterday, what book did we read?

00:01:10.376 --> 00:01:14.756
&gt;&gt;Heather: So autism presents
throughout a very broad spectrum.

00:01:15.096 --> 00:01:17.246
A lot of times, it's a social issue.

00:01:17.326 --> 00:01:20.316
Some of them demonstrate
behaviors because they are not able

00:01:20.316 --> 00:01:21.456
to communicate their needs.

00:01:21.456 --> 00:01:25.466
They may have difficulty sitting
still for a long period of time.

00:01:25.786 --> 00:01:28.276
&gt;&gt;Cheryl: They need different
sensory breaks throughout the day

00:01:28.496 --> 00:01:32.186
so they can self regulate
their feelings and emotions.

00:01:32.186 --> 00:01:34.646
&gt;&gt;Heather: Take some deep breaths here.

00:01:35.056 --> 00:01:38.826
&gt;&gt;Cheryl: The sensory room is probably
my most important piece of the day.

00:01:38.826 --> 00:01:42.536
Students go to the sensory room
in order to calm their bodies

00:01:42.536 --> 00:01:45.836
and get all the emotions out and
stabilize themselves, so they're ready

00:01:45.836 --> 00:01:47.046
to learn and they're happy.

00:01:47.316 --> 00:01:49.916
&gt;&gt;Heather: When we designed
the sensory room,

00:01:49.916 --> 00:01:51.736
we actually took the entire room apart.

00:01:51.946 --> 00:01:56.106
We carpeted the floor so that we
could absorb some of the sound.

00:01:56.286 --> 00:02:01.236
We put the shades on the ceiling to
change the light, so when they walk

00:02:01.236 --> 00:02:04.056
in that room, they feel the change.

00:02:04.346 --> 00:02:07.546
All the students in this school go
by that room and want to go in there.

00:02:07.626 --> 00:02:10.106
&gt;&gt;Cheryl: It's actually not
just for the STARS program.

00:02:10.406 --> 00:02:14.706
It's for any student in the whole
school that might be having a tough day.

00:02:14.706 --> 00:02:18.676
My class specifically, we
utilize the room once a day

00:02:18.676 --> 00:02:22.026
for a thirty minute break and then once
a week, we have physical therapists

00:02:22.026 --> 00:02:24.956
that work with our students.

00:02:25.046 --> 00:02:27.226
&gt;&gt;Heather: First thing that
they do is go on the ball

00:02:27.226 --> 00:02:31.736
and they bounce to a metronome.

00:02:31.736 --> 00:02:32.596
&gt;&gt;Clap. Hold.

00:02:32.786 --> 00:02:37.276
&gt;&gt;We work with the breathing
to calm them.

00:02:38.316 --> 00:02:39.116
&gt;&gt;Breath in.

00:02:39.216 --> 00:02:43.076
&gt;&gt;And then we move into some yoga.

00:02:43.076 --> 00:02:43.836
&gt;&gt;Lion.

00:02:43.836 --> 00:02:45.326
[ Students roar ]

00:02:45.326 --> 00:02:46.686
&gt;&gt;Heather: It's really
a way to ground them

00:02:46.686 --> 00:02:49.946
into the space before we have
them go out into the room.

00:02:50.026 --> 00:02:50.806
&gt;&gt;Cheryl: All right, my friends.

00:02:50.926 --> 00:02:53.376
We're going to do our
rotation now, okay?

00:02:53.496 --> 00:02:55.926
&gt;&gt;So there's different
stations in the sensory room,

00:02:56.046 --> 00:02:58.666
and some of my students
love specific stations.

00:02:59.996 --> 00:03:03.236
One in particular loves the
punching bags and the ropes.

00:03:03.776 --> 00:03:08.236
He's able to get all that anger and
frustration out, so that calms him down.

00:03:08.236 --> 00:03:11.316
Whereas another student, I know
he needs calming movements,

00:03:11.436 --> 00:03:13.576
so he's on the swing
going back and forth.

00:03:13.576 --> 00:03:17.856
&gt;&gt;Heather: Another area in
the room is the crash pad.

00:03:18.496 --> 00:03:23.036
You will see students that have sensory
issues bump into walls, bang their head.

00:03:23.416 --> 00:03:27.186
So what we've created is a
safe space to crash into.

00:03:27.326 --> 00:03:29.266
And then there's the light wall.

00:03:29.766 --> 00:03:31.876
You could use your hands,
you could use your feet.

00:03:32.036 --> 00:03:34.356
There's different games that
are programmed on there,

00:03:34.356 --> 00:03:37.416
and really what you're doing is
hitting something, and getting all

00:03:37.416 --> 00:03:39.156
that input back into your joints.

00:03:40.276 --> 00:03:41.976
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Yes, good girl.

00:03:42.046 --> 00:03:44.656
&gt;&gt;Heather: We also work on
balance and coordination.

00:03:44.746 --> 00:03:47.376
The walking path works on all of those,

00:03:47.546 --> 00:03:50.476
and that affects your vestibular
system, which is your inner ear.

00:03:50.476 --> 00:03:54.186
And they have to right themselves,
correct their body in space.

00:03:55.226 --> 00:03:56.806
We have ten pound slam balls.

00:03:58.206 --> 00:04:02.336
Some students just need to come in,
pick something heavy up and throw it.

00:04:02.706 --> 00:04:04.796
That's the essence of a sensory room.

00:04:04.796 --> 00:04:07.876
You're putting materials in
there that are appropriate,

00:04:07.916 --> 00:04:09.426
so a student's not throwing a chair.

00:04:10.016 --> 00:04:14.556
And at the end when they finish with
their stations, they lay on the floor

00:04:14.556 --> 00:04:17.706
and they're squished,
to give them more input,

00:04:17.786 --> 00:04:19.936
so that they're prepared
to leave the room.

00:04:20.066 --> 00:04:23.966
So everything that we do in there is
predictable, there's a set sequence.

00:04:24.316 --> 00:04:25.976
&gt;&gt;Cheryl: We're all done
with sensory room.

00:04:25.976 --> 00:04:27.836
We're going to walk back to our class.

00:04:28.026 --> 00:04:29.926
&gt;&gt;Patricia: So we have
found that the impact

00:04:29.926 --> 00:04:33.876
of the sensory room has
increased time on task,

00:04:33.876 --> 00:04:36.556
and it has decreased negative behaviors.

00:04:37.066 --> 00:04:40.396
So the kids are able to sit
in their seat and stay focused

00:04:40.396 --> 00:04:41.746
for longer periods of time.

00:04:41.746 --> 00:04:43.866
&gt;&gt;Teacher: What do you put
at the end of your sentence?

00:04:43.866 --> 00:04:44.436
&gt;&gt;Student: Period.

00:04:44.586 --> 00:04:45.776
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Good job, high five.

00:04:46.006 --> 00:04:48.956
&gt;&gt;Cheryl: They're quieter and
their hands are to themselves,

00:04:48.956 --> 00:04:50.826
and they're able to listen
to my directions.

00:04:50.946 --> 00:04:54.236
We're here, we came from the
sensory room, we're ready to learn.

00:04:54.576 --> 00:04:56.586
&gt;&gt;How does the sensory
room make you feel?

00:04:56.586 --> 00:04:57.216
&gt;&gt;Student: Happy.

00:04:57.586 --> 00:04:58.816
&gt;&gt;Cheryl: Nice job, Alan.
