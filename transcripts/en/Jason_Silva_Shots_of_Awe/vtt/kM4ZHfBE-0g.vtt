00:00:08.636 --> 00:00:10.010
JASON SILVA: So
one of the things

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:14.120
that happens when we grow
older, with our nodding

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:17.390
resignation into
nothingness, is that we

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:20.180
enter a kind of
consciousness known

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:23.150
as "the been there's and done
that's" of the adult mind.

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:27.860
It's that notion when nothing
excites or overwhelms anymore,

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:31.110
because you've
seen it all before.

00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:33.790
What a tragedy this is, right?

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:34.890
I mean, come on!

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:37.740
I mean we all
remember nostalgically

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:41.220
the intensity of experiencing
something for the first time,

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:44.380
seeing the world through
the eyes of child-- wonder

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:47.950
struck, entranced by awe.

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:53.030
Succumbing to astonishment,
giving in to astonishment,

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:57.150
mouth gaped wide, I mean
damn to see something

00:00:57.150 --> 00:00:58.020
for the first time.

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:01.480
But then what happens then,
you assimilate, you model it

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:03.705
in your brain, you
store it in your library

00:01:03.705 --> 00:01:08.680
of been there's and done that's
and you no longer engage,

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:11.510
right-- sensorily with stimuli.

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:13.910
It's called hedonic adaptation.

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:16.460
Familiarity breeds boredom.

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:19.726
It's so depressing, right?

00:01:19.726 --> 00:01:21.570
And so what do we do?

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:25.244
I think this is where mindful
self-inquiry comes in.

00:01:25.244 --> 00:01:28.985
This is where meditation-- this
is where breathing exercises,

00:01:28.985 --> 00:01:31.430
and yoga comes in.

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:35.030
This is where boarding a craft
that flies you across the world

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:37.390
can be therapeutic
like to injecting you

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:40.740
with a little bit of
life by stimulating

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:42.750
you, and jet-lagging
you, and placing you

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:45.230
with an entirely different
wallpaper of the mind.

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:48.340
That's why travel revitalizes.

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:50.710
It's why people self-medicate.

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:53.430
Sometimes tweaking our
perception, sometimes

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:57.130
that marijuana joint, can be
the magnifying lens or the pane

00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:59.760
of glass that doesn't
distort reality,

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:03.569
but confers our phenomenon--
a certain feeling of distance

00:02:03.569 --> 00:02:05.048
as David Lancet says.

00:02:05.048 --> 00:02:07.755
Perhaps that's why a museum
takes an ordinary item

00:02:07.755 --> 00:02:11.580
and puts it on the wall,
decontextualizes it, and brings

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:13.650
our attention back to it.

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:16.910
We get to enter the
archetypical space

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:20.470
where the specific stands
in for all of it's kind--

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:22.960
stands in for the
reversal, right?

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:26.197
We like to enter a modality
of consciousness known

00:02:26.197 --> 00:02:29.050
as Plato's Realm of Ideas.

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:31.632
I mean, that's where
you live in the present.

00:02:31.632 --> 00:02:35.600
That's when anxiety about
the future and melancholy

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:40.300
for the past get drowned out
by the ever present rapture

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:41.110
of the now.

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:42.460
And we are free!

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:45.420
And in that moment
we are Adam and Eve

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:47.305
in the Garden of
Eden before eating

00:02:47.305 --> 00:02:50.160
from the Tree of Knowledge--
knowing no death,

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:54.150
knowing only now and
the bliss of now.

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:57.601
If only we could get back there.

00:02:57.601 --> 00:02:59.840
I support whatever
works-- as long

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:01.640
as you don't hurt anybody else.

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:04.990
