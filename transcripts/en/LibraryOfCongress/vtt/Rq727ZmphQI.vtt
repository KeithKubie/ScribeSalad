00:00:01.260 --> 00:00:04.593
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, D.C.

00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:07.020


00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:07.690
&gt;&gt; It is my pleasure to be here
to introduce Michael Buckley.

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:14.723
Michael Buckley started his career
actually of college dabbling

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:15.273
in journalism believe it or not and
then he got wise and decided to move

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:22.793
on and see if he could find
a more promising field.

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:24.840
So he became a pasta maker.

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:27.040


00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:28.316
That didn't work out for him
so he decided to flip burgers,

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:31.743
still better than journalism.

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:36.090
So then he tried stand up and
he even sang in a punk band.

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:38.530
Maybe he'll do us a rendition.

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:39.793
Anyway eventually he ended up
on television and he worked

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:44.626
on a number of kid shows.

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:45.500
Luckily for us he never forgot
how much he really liked to write

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:49.306
or at least how good he was at it,
whether he liked to write or not.

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:52.700
And he is now as you
know the author of one

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:55.836
of the great book series there
is for kids, The Sisters Grimm,

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:03.150
in which the characters -- yes
you all know, much applause --

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:04.590


00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:08.860
in which the fairytales that
you all know come to life.

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:09.830
It's won many awards and he has gone
on to write The N.E.R.D.S. books,

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:15.726
which I'm sure you have -- there
are fans in the audience too.

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:17.073
[Sound effects] So because you are
excited I can tell, you don't need

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:25.006
to hear me anymore, I am very
happy to introduce Michael Buckley.

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:26.140
[Applause]

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:29.540
&gt;&gt; Michael Buckley:
Hey, how are you.

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:33.690
Are you guys ready to rock?

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:37.930


00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.666
I'm not really quite ready
to rock yet, but maybe later.

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:45.753
Thank you so much for
the great introduction.

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:48.243
I'm very happy to be here.

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:51.110
This is a big thrill
and a treat for me.

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:55.350
I write a couple of different
children's book series

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:56.450
like she said.

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:58.996
One is called The Sisters Grimm and
another one is called N.E.R.D.S.

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:01.853
And I thought I would tell
you a little bit about them

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.683
but I thought first I would tell
you about how I became an author.

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:09.823
It is a very exciting story
and it involves ninjas.

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:12.750


00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:13.230
[Laughter] It doesn't
involve ninjas.

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:17.263
I'm sorry, that was a lie.

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:21.470
I was born in a little
town in Ohio called Akron.

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:26.830
Many of you yes [Sound effects]
the most boring place in the world.

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:31.803
The only exciting thing that ever
happened there is we invented

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:33.810
the zipper.

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:37.160
[Laughter] That was a big day.

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:37.363
We also have a race there
called The Soapbox Derby.

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:40.743
This is a race where we
put as small child in a box

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:44.970
and shove them down a hill.

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:48.173
[Laughter] So Akron
is fun on that day.

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:53.220
[Laughter] Now when I was a
kid I was really influenced

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:55.920
by standup comedians.

00:02:56.520 --> 00:03:00.986
My older brother Jeff was a complete
degenerate and he would wake me

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:04.936
up in the middle of the night
to watch Saturday Night Live.

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:06.220
I was six.

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:10.613
[Laughter] I did not
understand it at all.

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:11.956
And he would force me to
listen to his comedy albums.

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:18.123
I grew up listening to like
Woody Allen and Steve Martin,

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:18.700
who is still one of my favorites.

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:24.100
And when I got to the age of
16 I decided that I wanted

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:26.133
to be a standup comedian too.

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:26.720
So I went to all of the comedy
clubs in Akron, which was one.

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:30.350
[Laughter] And I said, "I
want to be a comedian."

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:36.530
And they said, "You have
to be 18 to be a comedian."

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:41.573
And I said, "I am a18."

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:44.840
And they believed it,
because it was Akron.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.266
[Laughter] Now I got to
tour all over the country.

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:52.900
I preformed with some
pretty famous comics.

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:57.883
There's a guy named John Stuart on
a show called The Daily Show, yes.

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:00.150
[Sound effects] I performed with a
guy named Dane Cook and another guy

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:05.330
from Ohio named Dave Chappele.

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:08.553
None of the children
should know who that is.

00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:12.033
[Laughter] While I was
doing that I went to school.

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:17.873
I went to a college in southern
Ohio called Ohio University.

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:21.520
If you know football you
know Ohio State University.

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:26.436
If you know competitive checkers,
you know Ohio University.

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:31.186
[Laughter] I didn't
realize what she was doing.

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:33.790
Okay. That's very cool too.

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:38.820
What if I just talk to you and
see what comes out of your hands.

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:41.816
[Laughter] That's very good.

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:43.950


00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:49.620
Now when I graduated
from college I went

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:54.360
to a placed called New York
City and I was an intern

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:55.510
on a show called The Late
Show with David Letterman.

00:04:58.030 --> 00:04:58.080
I got to meet all kinds of famous
people, very glamorous people,

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:05.046
though my job on the
show was not glamorous.

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:05.283
I had to take care of David
Letterman's clinically insane

00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:09.823
golden retriever.

00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:13.756
He had a big, fat yellow
hairy meatball of rage

00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:18.456
that would attack me all the time.

00:05:19.410 --> 00:05:20.003
But if that dog wasn't murdering
me they would let me do something

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:24.150
really cool.

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:25.216
They would let me write a joke.

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:30.883
Now I had written my own jokes
for much smaller audiences

00:05:31.450 --> 00:05:32.323
but the late show has about 10
million people watching it every

00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:34.760
night so this was a
really big deal for me.

00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:41.926
And I would write that joke on a
piece of paper and I'd hand it Dave

00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:46.406
and I'd go hide behind the
curtain and look at the audience

00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:50.350
like some kind of weirdo,
and every once in a while one

00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:53.373
of my jokes would get a huge laugh.

00:05:54.350 --> 00:05:54.786
I often tell kids the best way I can
describe how that felt was it felt

00:05:58.580 --> 00:06:00.246
like I had a super power.

00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:01.003
Because I had written a
few words on piece of paper

00:06:03.490 --> 00:06:05.490
and it caused such a reaction.

00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:06.210
I wondered if I could get people
to feel other things with words

00:06:09.010 --> 00:06:12.276
like maybe I could make
them happy or sad or angry

00:06:13.350 --> 00:06:15.283
or want to move out of Akron.

00:06:17.610 --> 00:06:21.476
[Laughter] so that's kind of
how I got started as a writer.

00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:26.293
I was lucky enough to get some
very decent jobs right off the bat.

00:06:27.630 --> 00:06:30.763
I worked for a channel
called Discovery Channel.

00:06:30.810 --> 00:06:35.610
This is the channel where people are
constantly being attacked by sharks.

00:06:36.900 --> 00:06:37.840
[Laughter] I did a couple
of documentaries for them.

00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:40.500
One was about the mole people who
are a group of people who live

00:06:42.420 --> 00:06:42.523
in the New York City Subway system.

00:06:44.650 --> 00:06:48.316
And I did another documentary
about sideshow performers.

00:06:48.690 --> 00:06:52.090
And these are people who
swallow swords and eat fire

00:06:52.200 --> 00:06:54.466
and put scorpions in their mouths.

00:06:56.220 --> 00:06:59.620
Awesome. [Laughter] So I
got to hang out with people

00:07:04.300 --> 00:07:08.033
who were completely covered
in tattoos and I met a person

00:07:09.580 --> 00:07:12.780
who eats fire and I hung
out with a bearded lady.

00:07:14.770 --> 00:07:17.503
She had a beard down
to here and we dated.

00:07:19.190 --> 00:07:20.723
[Laughter] I'm kidding.

00:07:24.130 --> 00:07:25.130


00:07:25.200 --> 00:07:27.066
She wouldn't go out with me.

00:07:28.200 --> 00:07:29.200


00:07:31.660 --> 00:07:33.526
[Laughter] But I'm okay now.

00:07:34.660 --> 00:07:35.660


00:07:35.880 --> 00:07:37.183
After a while I went to work
for a channel called MTV.

00:07:38.110 --> 00:07:38.346
That's probably what the kids
know as the educational channel.

00:07:41.940 --> 00:07:42.160
[Laughter] I went to work for a
channel called VH1 for a little bit

00:07:46.120 --> 00:07:46.546
and I did some work for a
channel called Nickelodeon.

00:07:49.160 --> 00:07:50.893
[Laughter] Yes, my people.

00:07:52.180 --> 00:07:54.046
And then I came up this idea

00:07:56.470 --> 00:07:59.270
for a little book called
The Sisters Grimm.

00:07:59.480 --> 00:08:00.413
And I want to tell you
a little bit about it.

00:08:01.480 --> 00:08:02.133
It's about these two
girls who move to a town

00:08:03.760 --> 00:08:06.360
where everyone is a
fairytale character.

00:08:07.700 --> 00:08:09.633
Prince Charming is the mayor.

00:08:10.060 --> 00:08:13.126
The three little pigs
run the police department

00:08:13.400 --> 00:08:16.133
and the big bad wolf
is a yoga instructor.

00:08:17.930 --> 00:08:18.590
[Laughter] And the girls
take on the family business

00:08:20.670 --> 00:08:22.470
which is being a detective.

00:08:22.800 --> 00:08:23.780
They discover that their
great, great, great, great,

00:08:25.220 --> 00:08:27.153
great grandfather Jacob Grimm

00:08:28.860 --> 00:08:32.193
and his brother Wilhelm
weren't writing fairytales.

00:08:32.740 --> 00:08:36.273
They were writing case files
for their detective work.

00:08:36.350 --> 00:08:36.486
So the girls kind of take on this
family business and what I love

00:08:40.480 --> 00:08:41.240
about writing this series is
you never know who's going

00:08:43.320 --> 00:08:45.320
to be a good guy or a bad guy.

00:08:45.700 --> 00:08:50.300
Life for instance in book three, the
girls take on the most diabolical

00:08:50.310 --> 00:08:52.976
and evil fairytale
character of all time.

00:08:53.650 --> 00:08:56.983
Of course, I'm taking about
Little Red Riding Hood.

00:08:57.910 --> 00:09:00.310
She's terribly evil and super scary.

00:09:02.900 --> 00:09:03.770
[Laughter] I'm also writing
another series and that's kind

00:09:05.830 --> 00:09:07.563
of why I was invited here.

00:09:08.270 --> 00:09:08.280
It's a series called N.E.R.D.S.
[Sound effects] Thank you.

00:09:12.060 --> 00:09:13.726
N.E.R.D.S. is an acronym.

00:09:14.670 --> 00:09:18.803
It stands for the National
Espionage Rescue and Defense Society

00:09:19.020 --> 00:09:19.376
and it takes place here
in Arlington, Virginia.

00:09:21.730 --> 00:09:25.330
It's about a bunch of very
nerdy 5th graders who happen

00:09:27.060 --> 00:09:31.260
to be secret agents and their
nerdy qualities have been enhanced

00:09:31.810 --> 00:09:32.000
by science and they're basically
turned into super powers.

00:09:35.420 --> 00:09:39.553
One of the kids has the worst
set of braces you have ever seen.

00:09:39.990 --> 00:09:42.923
They wrap around his
head like an erector set

00:09:44.430 --> 00:09:47.430
but he can manipulate
them like a transformer.

00:09:47.890 --> 00:09:51.156
So if he needs a car, a
car comes out of his mouth

00:09:52.380 --> 00:09:54.846
but it is still attached
to his teeth.

00:09:55.560 --> 00:09:56.960
I think that's funny.

00:09:59.080 --> 00:09:59.546
[Laughter] There's
a kid who has eaten

00:10:01.080 --> 00:10:01.220
so much paste he can stick to walls.

00:10:03.340 --> 00:10:06.340
And there's a little
girl there who's inspired

00:10:06.760 --> 00:10:08.493
by my wife who has asthma.

00:10:09.710 --> 00:10:11.376
Anybody here have asthma?

00:10:11.710 --> 00:10:12.976
A few of you, yeah.

00:10:13.710 --> 00:10:14.330
Well my wife has this
thing called an inhaler.

00:10:16.090 --> 00:10:19.090
And she uses this to
make herself feel better.

00:10:19.270 --> 00:10:19.800
She takes it her mouth and pulls the
plunger and this medicine goes go

00:10:23.340 --> 00:10:24.020
into her lungs and every time I
heard her use it, it always sounded

00:10:27.060 --> 00:10:28.860
like a little rocket to me.

00:10:29.200 --> 00:10:29.496
So I created this character,
they call her Wheezer

00:10:32.170 --> 00:10:35.503
and Wheezer has two inhalers
that allow her to fly.

00:10:35.950 --> 00:10:39.816
She is sort of like a gasping
Iron Man, that kind of thing.

00:10:42.540 --> 00:10:43.783
[Laughter] And there's a bunch
of other kids in the team.

00:10:45.030 --> 00:10:47.030
The second book just came out.

00:10:47.130 --> 00:10:49.330
It is called M is for Mama's Boy.

00:10:50.210 --> 00:10:54.476
The villain is a 37 year old man
who lives in his mom's basement,

00:10:56.320 --> 00:10:58.453
which is scarier than it sounds.

00:10:59.780 --> 00:11:00.780


00:11:01.360 --> 00:11:02.006
And one of things that I love to
do when I travel around the country

00:11:05.180 --> 00:11:05.990
and I get to go to schools
and I come to conventions

00:11:07.770 --> 00:11:11.570
like this I just love to tell
kids how much I love my job.

00:11:12.370 --> 00:11:12.490
Like being a writer is
like the best job ever.

00:11:15.250 --> 00:11:17.850
And I know because I
worked at Taco Bell

00:11:17.930 --> 00:11:20.196
and that is not the best job ever.

00:11:21.180 --> 00:11:25.646
And I was always trying to convince
kids to think of it as a career.

00:11:26.140 --> 00:11:27.310
I think that once a kid gets a
book sometimes it's hard for them

00:11:29.170 --> 00:11:32.836
to fathom that somebody
actually sat down and wrote this

00:11:33.010 --> 00:11:33.350
and there's a real person behind it.

00:11:35.070 --> 00:11:35.480
And I always try to
encourage them to think of it

00:11:37.860 --> 00:11:38.010
as something they might want
to do when they get older.

00:11:41.310 --> 00:11:44.710
Like I said being a writer
is like a blessing to me.

00:11:45.930 --> 00:11:47.263
There's so many people in the
world that want to do that as job

00:11:48.730 --> 00:11:48.883
and I'm one of the luck idiots
that gets to do it for a living.

00:11:52.710 --> 00:11:52.880
And I want to thank all of you
guys, because every time you buy one

00:11:56.940 --> 00:12:01.073
of my books you make it completely
possible for me to just hang

00:12:01.730 --> 00:12:03.463
out in Starbuck's all day.

00:12:04.790 --> 00:12:05.790


00:12:06.610 --> 00:12:11.410
[Laughter] It if wasn't for you, I'd
have to put pants on in the morning.

00:12:11.730 --> 00:12:12.930
Thank you so much.

00:12:14.620 --> 00:12:16.153
You are my inspiration.

00:12:16.620 --> 00:12:18.820
You're the wind beneath my wings.

00:12:19.620 --> 00:12:20.620


00:12:22.510 --> 00:12:24.243
[Sound effects] Thank you.

00:12:24.510 --> 00:12:24.593
That's what I wanted
to be when I grew up.

00:12:27.160 --> 00:12:31.226
A guy who did not wear pants and
it's working out pretty good.

00:12:35.290 --> 00:12:38.490
[Laughter] So I know that
MT took some questions,

00:12:38.810 --> 00:12:40.543
maybe I could do the same.

00:12:41.970 --> 00:12:44.503
But I'm going to tell
you first of all,

00:12:45.910 --> 00:12:50.443
unless you're a really attractive
kid, I don't want to hear from you.

00:12:52.030 --> 00:12:52.346
[Sound effects] Okay you're really
cute so you can step right up.

00:12:55.980 --> 00:12:56.696
&gt;&gt; What inspired you to
make The Sisters Grimm?

00:12:58.330 --> 00:12:59.706
&gt;&gt; Michael Buckley: Well, you
now that's a very good question.

00:13:01.020 --> 00:13:01.153
People ask me that all the time.

00:13:03.020 --> 00:13:03.286
Why did I write The Sisters Grimm?

00:13:05.020 --> 00:13:06.820
Well I'm going to tell you.

00:13:07.020 --> 00:13:09.566
I went to a book store and I looked
at all the books that are out there

00:13:09.140 --> 00:13:09.990
for kids and I realized there's only
like two kinds of books for kids.

00:13:12.890 --> 00:13:16.890
There's books for boys where
the boy goes to wizarding school

00:13:17.070 --> 00:13:20.070
and he rides a dragon
and he fights a monster.

00:13:20.940 --> 00:13:25.140
And then there's books for girls
where they take care of a pony,

00:13:25.650 --> 00:13:26.650


00:13:31.140 --> 00:13:33.006
or they're dating a vampire.

00:13:34.140 --> 00:13:35.140


00:13:35.200 --> 00:13:37.333
[Laughter] That is all there is.

00:13:37.580 --> 00:13:39.646
And I just looked at my nieces.

00:13:41.120 --> 00:13:41.840
My brother has some kids, these
little girls and they are so spunky

00:13:44.800 --> 00:13:44.846
and full of fun and
they're just so passionate.

00:13:47.820 --> 00:13:50.486
And I just thought I
don't know any girls

00:13:50.510 --> 00:13:53.243
that would take a pony
over a dragon ride.

00:13:55.200 --> 00:13:59.600
And I thought it was about time
that girls got a book that they got

00:14:00.150 --> 00:14:04.350
to save the world and do all the
cool stuff that boys get to do.

00:14:04.910 --> 00:14:06.310
[Applause] Thank you.

00:14:08.530 --> 00:14:10.530
But don't applaud me just yet.

00:14:11.650 --> 00:14:15.650
But I wanted boys to read this
so I filled it full of boogers

00:14:15.800 --> 00:14:19.666
and all kinds of gross stuff,
so this isn't John Steinbeck.

00:14:22.800 --> 00:14:23.866
Yeah over there.

00:14:24.800 --> 00:14:25.466
Oh another really good
looking kid, okay.

00:14:26.800 --> 00:14:29.600
&gt;&gt; Oh, what's your
favorite children's book

00:14:30.710 --> 00:14:32.176
that you didn't write?

00:14:34.310 --> 00:14:35.400
&gt;&gt; Michael Buckley: Most
of them are so terrible.

00:14:36.420 --> 00:14:38.153
They're all just nonsense.

00:14:42.720 --> 00:14:42.960
[Laughter] No I think the single
biggest reason why I stand here

00:14:46.680 --> 00:14:48.746
today is a kids book when I was

00:14:49.220 --> 00:14:53.153
in the fourth grade I was what
they call a reluctant reader.

00:14:53.610 --> 00:14:56.610
Back then they were
called a pain in the butt.

00:14:57.080 --> 00:15:00.213
And the librarian dragged
me aside and she said,

00:15:00.570 --> 00:15:02.473
"Mr. Buckley you're going to read
a book today and you're going

00:15:02.800 --> 00:15:04.290
to tell me everything you know
about it at the end of the week."

00:15:05.510 --> 00:15:07.193
And she shoved a book in my
hand and it was called The Mouse

00:15:07.760 --> 00:15:10.760
and the Motorcycle and
it's by Beverly Cleary.

00:15:11.110 --> 00:15:12.110


00:15:13.120 --> 00:15:16.853
[Applause] Yes, and I had no
idea that books could be fun

00:15:17.840 --> 00:15:18.556
because they would give us this
book every year called The Yearling.

00:15:21.590 --> 00:15:26.323
Lovely book about a boy and his pet
deer and I kept waiting for the deer

00:15:28.570 --> 00:15:30.970
to grow rockets or
something explode.

00:15:33.170 --> 00:15:34.370
It never happened.

00:15:35.730 --> 00:15:39.930
So that was a very refreshing
thing for me because I had no idea

00:15:40.780 --> 00:15:41.576
that books could kind of just be --
well this is the highest compliment

00:15:44.650 --> 00:15:44.716
that I can give Beverly Cleary.

00:15:46.650 --> 00:15:47.176
That book is pointless and
that is exactly what I wanted

00:15:49.790 --> 00:15:52.056
when I was a 9 year old boy, yeah.

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:53.306
Yes, oh yes this is a
very good looking kid.

00:15:55.560 --> 00:15:56.560
Okay.

00:15:57.560 --> 00:15:58.693
&gt;&gt; Who is your favorite
Sisters Grimm character?

00:15:59.560 --> 00:16:00.743
&gt;&gt; Michael Buckley: Who is my
favorite Sisters Grimm character?

00:16:02.510 --> 00:16:04.176
You know it's a character

00:16:04.510 --> 00:16:05.643
that I didn't even want
to write about at first.

00:16:06.510 --> 00:16:08.376
His name is Prince Charming.

00:16:08.510 --> 00:16:10.176
And the reason that I like
writing about Prince Charming

00:16:10.510 --> 00:16:10.653
and this character has
been done to death.

00:16:13.100 --> 00:16:13.616
Most people have just killed
him and made him boring.

00:16:16.050 --> 00:16:16.920
But I started to just
notice something about him.

00:16:18.380 --> 00:16:21.246
Like Prince Charming
was born to save women.

00:16:22.910 --> 00:16:26.510
He's supposed to get on a
white horse and rescue girls.

00:16:29.200 --> 00:16:33.333
And what I like about him so much
is he's in love with somebody

00:16:33.910 --> 00:16:36.310
who does not want to
be saved at all.

00:16:37.380 --> 00:16:38.846
She can do it herself.

00:16:39.380 --> 00:16:43.780
In fact Snow White in the story,
she's like a self-defense teacher.

00:16:44.610 --> 00:16:48.410
She like -- she teaches old
ladies how to fend off robbers

00:16:49.800 --> 00:16:50.426
and she doesn't need to be rescued
and I just think it's so interesting

00:16:53.840 --> 00:16:57.706
to write this character who
was really born to be something

00:16:57.890 --> 00:17:00.823
that the woman he loves
doesn't want anymore.

00:17:00.860 --> 00:17:02.726
So he's sort of kind walking

00:17:02.860 --> 00:17:07.460
around with absolutely no idea what
he's supposed to do with his life.

00:17:07.570 --> 00:17:08.146
So that's my favorite
character to write.

00:17:09.660 --> 00:17:10.993
Yeah. How about you?

00:17:11.960 --> 00:17:13.626
A very handsome kid, yes.

00:17:14.740 --> 00:17:16.340
&gt;&gt; I have two questions.

00:17:16.810 --> 00:17:19.676
Number one what inspired
you for N.E.R.D.S.?

00:17:20.270 --> 00:17:20.500
&gt;&gt; Michael Buckley: Well N.E.R.D.S.,

00:17:22.440 --> 00:17:25.240
I went back to my 20th
high school reunion.

00:17:26.110 --> 00:17:27.110


00:17:27.200 --> 00:17:27.826
[Laughter] And this is an
important thing for all the kids.

00:17:30.440 --> 00:17:34.973
Now I went back and I hadn't seen
some of my old friends in 20 years.

00:17:35.630 --> 00:17:39.896
And what I discovered was all the
popular kids, the ones I wanted

00:17:40.980 --> 00:17:41.736
to hang out with and I wanted
to go to their parties,

00:17:43.690 --> 00:17:46.890
well they were losers,
but all of the N.E.R.D.S.,

00:17:50.060 --> 00:17:54.393
the complete odd balls that I
wouldn't have been caught dead with,

00:17:55.190 --> 00:17:57.190
they were doing amazing stuff.

00:17:57.190 --> 00:17:57.523
I mean they were running companies.

00:17:59.190 --> 00:17:59.723
They were traveling
all over the world.

00:18:01.190 --> 00:18:01.600
A couple of them were
married to super models.

00:18:03.780 --> 00:18:04.780
It was amazing.

00:18:05.780 --> 00:18:06.256
So I wanted to write a book
that kind of lets the kids know

00:18:09.170 --> 00:18:11.303
that the world does a flip flop.

00:18:11.880 --> 00:18:15.680
Eventually you will be the
coolest person in the room even

00:18:16.310 --> 00:18:16.566
if you are the biggest
nerd in the room right now.

00:18:19.320 --> 00:18:21.120
It all gets spinned around.

00:18:22.320 --> 00:18:23.320


00:18:25.530 --> 00:18:26.996
[Applause] Look at me.

00:18:27.530 --> 00:18:29.130
I was once very popular.

00:18:31.780 --> 00:18:32.780


00:18:36.710 --> 00:18:38.096
[Laughter] So maybe it
doesn't work in my case.

00:18:38.390 --> 00:18:40.790
&gt;&gt; Who's your favorite
Sisters Grimm?

00:18:43.810 --> 00:18:45.056
&gt;&gt; Michael Buckley: My favorite
Sisters Grimm book to write --

00:18:46.630 --> 00:18:50.830
that I wrote was number five,
It's Magic and Other Misdemeanors.

00:18:51.260 --> 00:18:51.646
And what I love about so
much is my favorite movie

00:18:54.140 --> 00:18:56.406
of all time is Back to the Future.

00:18:56.780 --> 00:18:57.020
And if they play that
on TBS, I'm watching it.

00:18:59.540 --> 00:19:01.540
I watch it every time's it on.

00:19:01.720 --> 00:19:04.386
And I wanted to write
a time travel story

00:19:06.830 --> 00:19:07.820
and I had all these fairytale
characters and I thought,

00:19:09.440 --> 00:19:10.200
"I wonder if anybody has ever
done that kind of thing."

00:19:12.280 --> 00:19:14.480
So I really enjoyed writing that.

00:19:15.010 --> 00:19:17.810
I love it also because
Cinderella is in it.

00:19:20.420 --> 00:19:22.886
And Cinderella is sort
of a Dr. Laura.

00:19:23.670 --> 00:19:27.670
She gives advice to people on
how to deal with their families

00:19:28.770 --> 00:19:33.103
on the radio and I just enjoyed
writing about her and her husband.

00:19:34.400 --> 00:19:36.933
So yeah number five
is my favorite one.

00:19:38.530 --> 00:19:39.530
Alright.

00:19:40.530 --> 00:19:44.996
&gt;&gt; Of the N.E.R.D.S. book that you
wrote which one is your favorite?

00:19:46.520 --> 00:19:50.320
&gt;&gt; Michael Buckley: Which one's
the most expensive to buy?

00:19:50.850 --> 00:19:51.850


00:19:52.110 --> 00:19:52.510
[Laughter] That would
be the new one.

00:19:54.110 --> 00:19:55.110
Number two.

00:19:56.110 --> 00:19:56.923
You know what I'm not sure that
I've had enough distance from them

00:19:59.630 --> 00:20:00.456
yet to actually pick the
one that I love the best.

00:20:02.070 --> 00:20:04.470
I am writing the third
one right now.

00:20:05.470 --> 00:20:09.936
It's about Wheezer and I said it's
kind of a mixture of Bring it On,

00:20:11.280 --> 00:20:15.280
the cheerleading movie, Fringe
that show on Fox where they go

00:20:16.040 --> 00:20:19.173
to alternate realities
and Silence of the Lambs.

00:20:20.420 --> 00:20:24.286
[Laughter] And it's for the
middle grade 8 to 12 year olds.

00:20:26.470 --> 00:20:27.470


00:20:29.900 --> 00:20:31.300
[Laughter] I'm sorry.

00:20:33.380 --> 00:20:35.780
Somebody should punch
me in the face.

00:20:37.140 --> 00:20:39.140
Did you have another question?

00:20:39.480 --> 00:20:40.480
Okay, alright.

00:20:41.480 --> 00:20:42.480
Thank you.

00:20:43.480 --> 00:20:43.546
You're a very good looking kid.

00:20:45.480 --> 00:20:46.480
Yes.

00:20:47.480 --> 00:20:49.160
&gt;&gt; Where did the idea of the
scenes in the book come from?

00:20:49.600 --> 00:20:51.000
&gt;&gt; Michael Buckley: I'm
sorry what was the question?

00:20:51.600 --> 00:20:52.753
&gt;&gt; Where do the ideas from the
scenes in the book come from?

00:20:54.380 --> 00:20:55.113
&gt;&gt; Michael Buckley:
Where do my ideas come

00:20:56.380 --> 00:20:56.446
from in the scenes of the book?

00:20:58.380 --> 00:21:02.513
Well you know I sort of see the
book, almost like it's a movie.

00:21:04.270 --> 00:21:07.803
And I sort of just transcribe
what I'm seeing my head.

00:21:08.050 --> 00:21:08.626
The way I visualize it is very
much like what you might see

00:21:11.340 --> 00:21:13.140
if you went to see a movie.

00:21:13.570 --> 00:21:16.436
I even -- actually I
do this terrible thing.

00:21:16.630 --> 00:21:20.096
My wife gets this horrible
magazine called Us Weekly.

00:21:20.160 --> 00:21:23.093
And what I do is, stars
they're just like us.

00:21:24.610 --> 00:21:26.343
And -- except they're not.

00:21:27.390 --> 00:21:31.523
So what I do is I cast the book
sometimes, so like if I'm going

00:21:36.190 --> 00:21:36.953
to write about Prince Charming
I'll try to find a picture

00:21:39.160 --> 00:21:39.956
of like Hugh Grant, who I often
think of like Prince Charming.

00:21:42.430 --> 00:21:42.746
And I cut it out and I put it
up on the wall and then like,

00:21:45.980 --> 00:21:46.386
I always think of like Kate
Beckinsale as Snow White.

00:21:49.040 --> 00:21:50.040
She's so hot.

00:21:51.210 --> 00:21:53.543
[Laughter] Did I say that out loud?

00:21:55.050 --> 00:21:57.850
So, I put pictures of
her up there and then

00:21:58.900 --> 00:21:59.260
when the police come
I go straight to jail.

00:22:01.340 --> 00:22:06.006
[Laughter] But that sort of helps me
cast the book and it helps me sort

00:22:06.280 --> 00:22:09.346
of visualize it and
that's kind of how I do it.

00:22:09.820 --> 00:22:10.820
Thank you.

00:22:11.820 --> 00:22:12.820
Yes?

00:22:13.820 --> 00:22:16.083
&gt;&gt; How much research do you have to
do before writing The Sisters Grimm?

00:22:16.290 --> 00:22:17.623
&gt;&gt; Michael Buckley: Well you know
what I had to do a lot of research.

00:22:19.490 --> 00:22:23.223
I was under the impression
that I actually knew something

00:22:23.560 --> 00:22:23.613
about fairytales because
I had seen all the movies.

00:22:26.840 --> 00:22:27.840
I was wrong.

00:22:28.840 --> 00:22:33.440
When I was growing up we got most
of our fairytale stories from Disney

00:22:35.550 --> 00:22:39.750
and a very good example is the
movie they made called Pinocchio.

00:22:41.790 --> 00:22:43.923
Most of us have seen that movie.

00:22:44.320 --> 00:22:45.453
It's really cute.

00:22:46.320 --> 00:22:47.010
He's got that little dancing cricket
and the cricket gives him advice.

00:22:50.230 --> 00:22:53.896
But in the book, which is
very different from the movie,

00:22:53.900 --> 00:22:54.190
Pinocchio kills the cricket
on page 5 with a hammer.

00:22:57.010 --> 00:23:00.543
And a friend of mine made
me read this and I was like,

00:23:01.080 --> 00:23:02.746
"Kent that can't be true.

00:23:03.080 --> 00:23:04.413
That can't be true."

00:23:05.080 --> 00:23:09.280
And I started to realize there
was a lot going on in fairytales,

00:23:09.370 --> 00:23:10.393
especially the stories that
I didn't know anything about.

00:23:12.080 --> 00:23:16.346
And so I had to do a lot of reading
and writing at the same time.

00:23:16.600 --> 00:23:20.066
And in the process I became
a huge fan of fairytales.

00:23:22.200 --> 00:23:23.200
Yeah. Alrighty.

00:23:24.550 --> 00:23:24.780
&gt;&gt; Hi. Can you tell us about
Snow White's story before it had

00:23:28.320 --> 00:23:29.320
been changed?

00:23:30.320 --> 00:23:31.186
You know about the
character or the margins.

00:23:32.320 --> 00:23:34.386
&gt;&gt; Michael Buckley: You are
totally ruining this for everyone.

00:23:34.320 --> 00:23:34.453
&gt;&gt; Well I mean in a future book.

00:23:36.320 --> 00:23:38.320
&gt;&gt; Michael Buckley: Well in --

00:23:38.320 --> 00:23:40.920
alright I'll just tell
you I don't care.

00:23:41.630 --> 00:23:44.363
[Laughter] I already
got my advance spent.

00:23:46.160 --> 00:23:47.160


00:23:49.990 --> 00:23:52.856
[Laughter] In The Sisters
Grimm there's a --

00:23:53.850 --> 00:23:58.516
Snow White is caught up in a story
that she doesn't even know she's in.

00:24:01.150 --> 00:24:04.683
In fact, one of the ideas
is that Snow White's mother,

00:24:06.380 --> 00:24:10.646
the wicked queen rewrote the story
of her life taking out a very,

00:24:12.020 --> 00:24:12.586
very bad person out of her life
that she had been forced to marry

00:24:15.720 --> 00:24:15.746
and literally creating Prince
Charming out of nothing

00:24:19.160 --> 00:24:21.893
to be the husband that
she wanted for him.

00:24:23.030 --> 00:24:24.536
So what you're going to find out in
the very last Sisters Grimm book is

00:24:26.190 --> 00:24:27.856
that -- oh it's terrible.

00:24:28.190 --> 00:24:28.546
But I'm writing this
thing called N.E.R.D.S.

00:24:30.700 --> 00:24:32.500
and it's just really great.

00:24:33.440 --> 00:24:37.373
But you're going to find out
about Prince Charming's brother

00:24:39.870 --> 00:24:41.470
who is the very bad guy.

00:24:42.520 --> 00:24:45.920
His name is Prince Atticus,
isn't that a scary name.

00:24:46.730 --> 00:24:50.396
And you're going to find out
how this all works together

00:24:51.640 --> 00:24:51.816
and we're going allow Snow White
to sort of get a hold of herself

00:24:55.730 --> 00:24:57.930
for the first time in the series.

00:24:58.070 --> 00:24:58.403
So I really love writing about her.

00:25:00.070 --> 00:25:00.233
She's a really strong
female character.

00:25:02.440 --> 00:25:02.663
She reminds me a lot of my grandma.

00:25:04.550 --> 00:25:06.550
And -- except for the kung fu.

00:25:07.100 --> 00:25:09.300
And -- but I do really enjoy her.

00:25:11.490 --> 00:25:13.756
Does that answer the -- okay cool.

00:25:13.920 --> 00:25:14.920
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:25:15.920 --> 00:25:16.253
&gt;&gt; Michael Buckley: You're welcome.

00:25:17.920 --> 00:25:19.053
Alright, Mr. Man.

00:25:19.920 --> 00:25:21.520
&gt;&gt; Okay I was wondering.

00:25:21.920 --> 00:25:23.720
You said there would be a last
Sisters Grimm, that's awful

00:25:23.920 --> 00:25:27.053
but how many books are
going to be in the series

00:25:27.190 --> 00:25:27.380
like how many are there going to be?

00:25:29.400 --> 00:25:29.683
&gt;&gt; Michael Buckley: Well there's
only going to be nine in the series.

00:25:33.650 --> 00:25:37.316
But if you guys keep building
it I think I could milk it

00:25:37.960 --> 00:25:40.360
for at least two or
three more books.

00:25:42.280 --> 00:25:43.280


00:25:45.870 --> 00:25:46.870
[Laughter] Yes.

00:25:48.090 --> 00:25:52.356
And then -- and it'll be like --
what's that book about the cats?

00:25:52.510 --> 00:25:54.176
There's like 70,000 cats.

00:25:54.510 --> 00:25:56.576
Yeah I'll just do it like that.

00:25:58.060 --> 00:26:01.926
&gt;&gt; If you could have any nerdy
superpower what would it be?

00:26:01.980 --> 00:26:02.980
&gt;&gt; Michael Buckley: Oh
that's a good question.

00:26:03.980 --> 00:26:07.046
I'm trying to think of
myself when I was a kid.

00:26:08.490 --> 00:26:09.446
And I don't know if
there's a super power here,

00:26:10.600 --> 00:26:13.066
but when I was kid
there was an actor.

00:26:13.720 --> 00:26:15.520
His name was Joey Laurence.

00:26:16.020 --> 00:26:20.220
And Joey Laurence had a haircut
that required a Tupperware bowl.

00:26:21.670 --> 00:26:26.270
You would put the bowl on his head
and you would cut around it so that

00:26:26.370 --> 00:26:26.773
if you hung upside down you could
put a bowel of cereal in your head.

00:26:30.500 --> 00:26:34.633
And I think that -- and I had
that haircut for a very long time

00:26:34.860 --> 00:26:37.993
or maybe when I was 18
and I had a mullet, yeah.

00:26:41.710 --> 00:26:42.710
That was great.

00:26:43.710 --> 00:26:44.710
Girls loved it.

00:26:46.380 --> 00:26:51.113
Maybe something like the mullet, and
it's like octopus arms and it comes

00:26:52.500 --> 00:26:55.633
out and makes you party
in the back and business

00:26:58.180 --> 00:26:59.980
in the front kind of thing.

00:27:00.980 --> 00:27:01.980
I'm not sure.

00:27:02.980 --> 00:27:04.513
How am I doing on time?

00:27:05.080 --> 00:27:05.146
Oh she's just shaking her head.

00:27:07.080 --> 00:27:08.813
Oh the two minute warning.

00:27:11.520 --> 00:27:13.186
Oh we have three minutes.

00:27:13.520 --> 00:27:14.520
Cool okay.

00:27:15.520 --> 00:27:15.986
Oh well maybe I'll
just go on forever.

00:27:17.520 --> 00:27:18.720
How about you sir.

00:27:19.520 --> 00:27:19.920
By the way you're very good looking.

00:27:21.520 --> 00:27:21.786
All of you are great looking kids.

00:27:23.520 --> 00:27:27.720
&gt;&gt; How did you come up with what
N.E.R.D.S. actually stands for?

00:27:29.720 --> 00:27:29.766
&gt;&gt; Michael Buckley: Well you
know what I actually had help.

00:27:33.540 --> 00:27:36.273
My wife is a much smarter
person then I am

00:27:37.130 --> 00:27:40.730
and in fact my wife actually
helped me coin the phrase,

00:27:41.380 --> 00:27:43.780
"ever after" from The Sisters Grimm.

00:27:44.800 --> 00:27:49.133
She is like really smart except
for the part where she married me.

00:27:51.740 --> 00:27:53.673
That was big misstep I think.

00:27:56.810 --> 00:27:59.610
But -- so she kind of
worked it out with me

00:28:01.220 --> 00:28:03.820
and we finally figured
out how to do it.

00:28:03.830 --> 00:28:04.203
I was trying to do it so it was
G.E.E.K.S. and I could only get

00:28:07.590 --> 00:28:07.813
as far as like Government Espionage

00:28:09.700 --> 00:28:09.880
and then I didn't know
what the next E was.

00:28:12.320 --> 00:28:14.986
Then I tried D.O.R.K.S.,
Department of --

00:28:15.140 --> 00:28:18.140
and then I couldn't get
any further than that.

00:28:18.990 --> 00:28:21.456
That was the one that
worked the best.

00:28:21.660 --> 00:28:22.660
So -- okay yes.

00:28:23.660 --> 00:28:28.126
&gt;&gt; What made you make Sabrina be
in like all the Sister Grimm books?

00:28:28.390 --> 00:28:32.990
&gt;&gt; Michael Buckley: This is a story
that I don't want my wife to hear.

00:28:33.090 --> 00:28:35.090
Sabrina and Daphne actually --

00:28:35.090 --> 00:28:37.890
Daphne is based on an
old girlfriend I had.

00:28:38.210 --> 00:28:41.610
Her name was Renee Hoff,
and Renee was a very happy,

00:28:42.290 --> 00:28:45.156
very full of energy and
just so super sweet.

00:28:45.980 --> 00:28:50.246
But she had this older sister who
was super grouchy all the time.

00:28:51.380 --> 00:28:55.646
And they fought like cats and dogs
except if somebody else picked

00:28:55.750 --> 00:29:00.016
on them, and then they would fight
because they were from Jersey.

00:29:00.280 --> 00:29:03.613
[Laughter] So those two
characters are really based

00:29:04.750 --> 00:29:06.350
on people I really knew.

00:29:06.940 --> 00:29:10.273
And I think we have time
for one or two more, yeah.

00:29:11.480 --> 00:29:15.613
&gt;&gt; When Huck is first introduced
your books it's this nasty kid

00:29:16.550 --> 00:29:19.816
who burps and farts and
does all this gross stuff.

00:29:20.750 --> 00:29:23.216
&gt;&gt; Michael Buckley:
Yeah he's awesome.

00:29:24.120 --> 00:29:28.520
&gt;&gt; But slowly in the Magic and
other Misdemeanors they get married.

00:29:30.540 --> 00:29:33.740
And you start seeing Huck
like going into puberty

00:29:35.080 --> 00:29:36.746
because he likes Sabrina.

00:29:37.260 --> 00:29:41.393
How did you transition from this
kid who just lives in the wild

00:29:43.260 --> 00:29:46.793
with the sloughs for fun to
some kid who's growing up?

00:29:47.880 --> 00:29:49.280
&gt;&gt; Michael Buckley: This
is a really great question.

00:29:49.880 --> 00:29:50.880
Thank you.

00:29:51.880 --> 00:29:54.546
[Laughter] I don't
know how to answer it.

00:29:55.340 --> 00:29:59.873
[Laughter] Well you know Huck is
like he great anti-hero of my story.

00:30:00.890 --> 00:30:05.423
He's sort of like the Hans Solo of
the Sisters Grimm and he did start

00:30:07.280 --> 00:30:11.480
out much more despicable but you
know this is the truth in life.

00:30:12.950 --> 00:30:15.083
And this is really for the boys.

00:30:16.700 --> 00:30:20.500
It doesn't matter how terrible
you are, how gross you are,

00:30:23.530 --> 00:30:25.396
how much of a loser you are,

00:30:25.900 --> 00:30:28.700
you will meet a woman
and she will fix you.

00:30:30.220 --> 00:30:31.220


00:30:39.350 --> 00:30:40.950
[Laughter] Alright guys.

00:30:41.350 --> 00:30:43.216
I'm sorry we're out of time.

00:30:43.350 --> 00:30:44.483
Did you have fun?

00:30:45.350 --> 00:30:47.150
Alright. Thank you so much.

00:30:48.280 --> 00:30:49.280
[Laughter]

00:30:50.280 --> 00:30:52.146
