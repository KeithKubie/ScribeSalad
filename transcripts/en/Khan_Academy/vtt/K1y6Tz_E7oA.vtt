00:00:00.188 --> 00:00:01.325
- [Voiceover] Let's think about what happens

00:00:01.325 --> 00:00:04.181
to the median and mean of a set of numbers

00:00:04.181 --> 00:00:06.225
when I change one of the numbers.

00:00:06.225 --> 00:00:08.035
And so let's look at this example.

00:00:08.035 --> 00:00:11.101
A group of four friends likes to bowl together,

00:00:11.101 --> 00:00:15.186
and each friend keeps track of his all-time highest score

00:00:15.186 --> 00:00:16.906
in a single game.

00:00:16.906 --> 00:00:21.201
Their high scores are all between 180 and 220,

00:00:21.201 --> 00:00:25.357
except for Adam, whose high score is 250.

00:00:25.357 --> 00:00:27.725
Adam then bowls a great game

00:00:27.725 --> 00:00:31.092
and has a new high score of 290.

00:00:31.092 --> 00:00:35.110
How will increasing Adam's high score affect the mean

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:37.199
and median?

00:00:37.199 --> 00:00:39.149
Now, like always, pause this video

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:41.257
and see if you can figure this out yourself.

00:00:42.307 --> 00:00:43.956
All right, so let's just think about what they're saying.

00:00:43.956 --> 00:00:45.698
We have four friends,

00:00:45.698 --> 00:00:50.063
and they each keep track of their all-time high score,

00:00:50.063 --> 00:00:51.548
so we're gonna have four data points,

00:00:51.548 --> 00:00:55.100
an all-time high score for each of the friends.

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:57.549
So let's see, this is the lowest score of the friends,

00:00:57.549 --> 00:00:59.917
this is the second lowest, second to highest,

00:00:59.917 --> 00:01:02.447
and this is the highest scoring of the friends.

00:01:02.447 --> 00:01:03.423
So let's see.

00:01:03.423 --> 00:01:06.070
Their high scores are all between 100 and 220,

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:08.973
except for Adam, whose high score is 250.

00:01:08.973 --> 00:01:12.525
So before Adam bowls this super-awesome game,

00:01:12.525 --> 00:01:14.220
the scores look something like this.

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.976
The lowest score is 180.

00:01:16.976 --> 00:01:21.202
Adam scores 250.

00:01:21.202 --> 00:01:22.711
And if you take Adam out of the picture,

00:01:22.711 --> 00:01:25.056
the highest score is a 220.

00:01:25.056 --> 00:01:26.821
And we actually don't know what this score right

00:01:26.821 --> 00:01:28.422
over there is.

00:01:28.422 --> 00:01:30.628
Now, after Adam bowls a great new game

00:01:30.628 --> 00:01:32.903
and has a new high score of 290,

00:01:32.903 --> 00:01:34.691
what does the data set look like?

00:01:34.691 --> 00:01:38.401
Well, this guy's high score hasn't changed.

00:01:38.401 --> 00:01:41.030
This guy's high score hasn't changed.

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:43.159
This guy's high score hasn't changed.

00:01:43.159 --> 00:01:44.908
But now Adam has a new high score.

00:01:44.908 --> 00:01:49.854
Instead of 250, it is now 290.

00:01:49.854 --> 00:01:51.669
So my question is,

00:01:51.669 --> 00:01:54.549
well, the first question is, does this change the median?

00:01:55.519 --> 00:01:57.609
Well, remember the median is the middle number.

00:01:57.609 --> 00:02:00.163
And if we're looking at four numbers here,

00:02:00.163 --> 00:02:01.859
the median is going to be the average

00:02:01.859 --> 00:02:03.623
of the middle two numbers.

00:02:03.623 --> 00:02:04.668
So we're gonna take the average

00:02:04.668 --> 00:02:08.662
of whatever this question mark is and 220.

00:02:08.662 --> 00:02:12.238
That's going to be the median.

00:02:12.238 --> 00:02:15.396
Now, over here, after Adam has scored a new high score,

00:02:15.396 --> 00:02:17.137
how do we calculate the median?

00:02:17.137 --> 00:02:18.600
Well, we still have four numbers,

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:21.450
and the middle two are still the same two middle numbers.

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:25.368
Whatever this friend's highest score was, it hasn't changed,

00:02:25.368 --> 00:02:26.750
and so we're gonna have the same median.

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:29.572
It's gonna be 220 plus question mark, divided by two.

00:02:29.572 --> 00:02:32.381
It's gonna be halfway between question mark and 220.

00:02:32.381 --> 00:02:34.935
So our median won't change.

00:02:34.935 --> 00:02:39.184
So median, no change.

00:02:39.184 --> 00:02:41.146
Median, no change.

00:02:42.086 --> 00:02:44.549
So let's think about the mean now.

00:02:44.549 --> 00:02:48.356
Well, the mean, you take the sum of all these numbers

00:02:48.356 --> 00:02:49.889
and then you divide by four,

00:02:49.889 --> 00:02:50.775
and then you take the sum

00:02:50.775 --> 00:02:52.930
of all these numbers and divide by four.

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:54.670
So which sum is going to be higher?

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:57.806
Well, the first three numbers are the same,

00:02:57.806 --> 00:03:00.322
but in the second list you have a higher number.

00:03:00.322 --> 00:03:05.307
290 is higher than 250.

00:03:05.307 --> 00:03:08.279
So if you take these four and divide by four,

00:03:08.279 --> 00:03:10.042
you're going to have a larger value

00:03:10.042 --> 00:03:12.202
than if you take these four and divide by four,

00:03:12.202 --> 00:03:14.408
because their sum is gonna be larger.

00:03:14.408 --> 00:03:16.753
And so the mean is going to go up.

00:03:16.753 --> 00:03:19.194
The mean will increase.

00:03:19.194 --> 00:03:21.563
The mean will increase.

00:03:21.563 --> 00:03:24.559
So median, no change, and mean, increase.

00:03:24.559 --> 00:03:28.017
All right, so this says both increase. No, that's not right.

00:03:28.017 --> 00:03:31.130
The median will increase. No, median doesn't change.

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:33.039
The mean will increase. Yep.

00:03:33.039 --> 00:03:35.170
And the median will stay the same.

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:39.395
Yep, that's exactly what we're talking about.

00:03:39.395 --> 00:03:41.695
And if you wanna make it a little bit more tangible,

00:03:41.695 --> 00:03:43.690
you can replace question mark with some number.

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:46.275
You could replace it, maybe this question mark is 200.

00:03:46.275 --> 00:03:48.080
And if you try it out with 200,

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:50.634
just to make things tangible, you're going to see that

00:03:50.634 --> 00:03:52.329
that is indeed going to be the case.

00:03:52.329 --> 00:03:54.697
The median would be halfway between these two numbers.

00:03:54.697 --> 00:03:56.276
And I just arbitrarily picked 200.

00:03:56.276 --> 00:03:59.253
It could be any number some place

00:03:59.253 --> 00:04:01.635
between 180 and 220,

00:04:01.635 --> 00:04:03.058
but you see, for this example,

00:04:03.058 --> 00:04:05.774
it's very tangibly that the median does not change.

00:04:05.774 --> 00:04:08.308
But the mean increases, 'cause we increase the sum.

00:04:08.308 --> 00:04:09.698
We increase the sum by 40,

00:04:09.698 --> 00:04:11.347
because we've increased this last number,

00:04:11.347 --> 00:04:13.413
and only the last number, by 40.
