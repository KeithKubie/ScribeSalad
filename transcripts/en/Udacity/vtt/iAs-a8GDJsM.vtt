00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Let's summarize facts about implicit solvers. The simplest of which is the backward Euler method.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.000
The big benefit is the stability. We can use large step sizes.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000
And stiff differential equations don't force us to use

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000
overly tiny step sizes, which results in speed.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
Some types of simulation are almost impossible without implicit solvers.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.000
Think of cloth simulation and the simulation of water vase.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:32.000
These types of simulation may be forbiddingly slow without the speed offered by implicit solvers.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.000
The big disadvantage of implicit solvers is that they are well implicit.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
You get equations that we have to solve, which is hard to do

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
or can even be impossible to do with standard functions.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
Mathematicians have come up with quite a range of methods to address this issue.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.000
For instance, in a predictor-corrector approach, you use an explicit solver

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.000
such as the forward Euler method to predict the value for the next step

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.000
and then use an implicit method to correct it, actually Heun method,

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
that we learned about in a previous unit is of that type.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:11.000
All you can use is a rate of methods to numerically solve this implicit equation, not with pen and paper.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000
And the second disadvantage of implicit solvers,

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.000
most of them tend to lose energy in physical simulations.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:23.000
We saw that the forward Euler method, an explicit solver, increased the energy.

00:01:23.000 --> 99:59:59.000
Implicit solvers tend to work the other way round and to lose energy.
