00:00:01.710 --> 00:00:03.420
Bladesmiths, this
is the kill test

00:00:03.420 --> 00:00:06.005
to see what kind of lethal
damage your weapon will do.

00:00:06.005 --> 00:00:07.716
We'll take your sword
and deliver killing

00:00:07.716 --> 00:00:09.551
blows on this boar carcass.

00:00:09.551 --> 00:00:11.094
Jonathan, you're up first.
You ready?

00:00:11.094 --> 00:00:12.470
Go for it.

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:14.222
So a boar has got a
really tough hide on it.

00:00:14.222 --> 00:00:15.473
I'm a little nervous.

00:00:15.473 --> 00:00:16.891
I mean, it's a big weapon.

00:00:16.891 --> 00:00:18.518
It's got a lot of
swinging power behind it.

00:00:18.518 --> 00:00:20.812
But there's a lot
that could go wrong.

00:00:20.812 --> 00:00:22.647
[music playing]

00:00:40.373 --> 00:00:41.708
All right, Jonathan.

00:00:41.708 --> 00:00:43.543
Let's talk about your
sword right here.

00:00:43.543 --> 00:00:46.212
First up, it's sharp.

00:00:46.212 --> 00:00:49.090
When wielding this weapon,
there is a nice balance to it.

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:52.427
Overall, your weapon,
sir, will kill.

00:00:52.427 --> 00:00:53.219
Thank you.

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:55.722
Ed, are you ready?

00:00:55.722 --> 00:00:57.140
I am.

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:00.602
I see him queuing up to
have a go at the pig.

00:01:00.602 --> 00:01:02.604
I'm just like, please
don't break, please don't

00:01:02.604 --> 00:01:05.356
break, please don't break.

00:01:05.356 --> 00:01:08.151
[music playing]

00:01:18.578 --> 00:01:19.913
All right, Ed.

00:01:19.913 --> 00:01:21.372
Let's talk about your
weapon right here.

00:01:21.372 --> 00:01:23.958
First up, I like the
leather wrapping that you

00:01:23.958 --> 00:01:24.959
did right here on the handle.

00:01:24.959 --> 00:01:26.878
It gives it a good grip.

00:01:26.878 --> 00:01:29.339
Your blade is a little
bit on the heavier side.

00:01:29.339 --> 00:01:35.512
But upon the swing, it lacerates
deeply into the carcass.

00:01:35.512 --> 00:01:36.095
It will kill.

00:01:39.098 --> 00:01:42.060
Gentlemen, this is
the dreaded bone chop.

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:43.394
Remember, this test
is all about what

00:01:43.394 --> 00:01:44.771
the bones do to your
blades and not what

00:01:44.771 --> 00:01:46.689
your blades do to the bones.

00:01:46.689 --> 00:01:48.191
Ed, you're up first.
Are you ready?

00:01:48.191 --> 00:01:49.317
Mm-hm.

00:01:49.317 --> 00:01:51.611
[music playing]

00:01:59.577 --> 00:02:02.914
Well, Ed, it's
all in one piece

00:02:02.914 --> 00:02:05.416
but there is some chipping
on the blade here.

00:02:05.416 --> 00:02:06.835
Oh, shoot.

00:02:06.835 --> 00:02:09.546
The sword itself is heavy.

00:02:09.546 --> 00:02:11.756
The handle is a bit
big for my hand.

00:02:11.756 --> 00:02:14.759
All that being said, it
held up relatively well.

00:02:14.759 --> 00:02:16.177
Well done.
- Thank you.

00:02:16.177 --> 00:02:17.679
Jonathan, you're up.
You ready?

00:02:17.679 --> 00:02:18.638
Hope so.

00:02:18.638 --> 00:02:21.474
[music playing]

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:34.904
Well, Jonathan,
it's a similar result.

00:02:34.904 --> 00:02:38.116
There is some edge
chipping here as well.

00:02:38.116 --> 00:02:42.954
The handle being round on one
of the hits did roll in my hand.

00:02:42.954 --> 00:02:46.416
Aside from edge chipping,
it held up very well.

00:02:46.416 --> 00:02:47.125
Well done.

00:02:47.125 --> 00:02:50.128
Thank you.

00:02:50.128 --> 00:02:51.379
All right, gentlemen.

00:02:51.379 --> 00:02:52.630
To test the sharpness
of your blade,

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:54.299
I'll be cutting
through these pumpkins.

00:02:54.299 --> 00:02:56.509
We'll take a look at those
cuts, see how clean they are.

00:02:56.509 --> 00:02:57.969
Jonathan, you're up.
Are you ready?

00:02:57.969 --> 00:02:59.095
Ready.

00:02:59.095 --> 00:03:01.389
[music playing]

00:03:13.192 --> 00:03:14.360
Nice.

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:16.905
Jonathan, you
can see your blade

00:03:16.905 --> 00:03:18.907
has such a flexibility to it.

00:03:18.907 --> 00:03:21.826
And when it hit, the
blade actually warped

00:03:21.826 --> 00:03:24.245
out, cut over and through.

00:03:24.245 --> 00:03:25.872
It's a heck of a cutter.
Nicely done.

00:03:25.872 --> 00:03:27.999
Thank you.

00:03:27.999 --> 00:03:29.292
All right.

00:03:29.292 --> 00:03:30.001
Ed, you're up.

00:03:30.001 --> 00:03:31.628
Are you ready?

00:03:31.628 --> 00:03:34.130
I'm pretty confident going
through the pumpkin slice

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:38.426
because a pumpkin is a lot
softer than cow fingers.

00:03:38.426 --> 00:03:41.262
[music playing]

00:03:47.852 --> 00:03:49.604
All right, Ed.

00:03:49.604 --> 00:03:52.273
That's a good clean
cut on that pumpkin.

00:03:52.273 --> 00:03:53.816
You kind of see what happened.

00:03:53.816 --> 00:03:55.985
I started compensating
for the weight

00:03:55.985 --> 00:03:57.612
and pulled up and through.

00:03:57.612 --> 00:04:00.531
The weight factor
in me using it is

00:04:00.531 --> 00:04:04.118
an issue, but definitely sharp,
definitely a good cutter.

00:04:04.118 --> 00:04:05.495
Well done.

00:04:05.495 --> 00:04:07.580
Jonathan and Ed, the
judges have finished

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:09.916
their deliberation and there
can only be one "Forged in Fire"

00:04:09.916 --> 00:04:17.006
champion.
And that champion is Jonathan.

00:04:17.006 --> 00:04:18.341
Congratulations.

00:04:18.341 --> 00:04:20.510
You are our new "Forged
in Fire" champion.

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:23.054
Ed, your sword
didn't make the cut.

00:04:23.054 --> 00:04:24.555
David Baker is going
to tell you why.

00:04:24.555 --> 00:04:27.016
Ed, you brought us a
well crafted and beautiful

00:04:27.016 --> 00:04:28.393
looking weapon.

00:04:28.393 --> 00:04:30.353
But the oversized handle
and the extra weight

00:04:30.353 --> 00:04:32.271
made that weapon
difficult to wield.

00:04:32.271 --> 00:04:34.190
And at the end of the
day, this competition is

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:36.693
about making the best weapon.

00:04:36.693 --> 00:04:39.946
Ed, please
surrender your blade.

00:04:39.946 --> 00:04:42.031
ED: I agree with the
judge's decision.

00:04:42.031 --> 00:04:43.908
His blade was more usable.

00:04:43.908 --> 00:04:46.953
There is a big part of me
that wanted Jonathan to win.

00:04:46.953 --> 00:04:49.414
There's a bigger part of me that
wanted me to win, of course,

00:04:49.414 --> 00:04:52.417
but I'm really happy for him
because he's a great guy.

00:04:52.417 --> 00:04:55.086
I made a good blade, he made
a little bit better blade.

00:04:55.086 --> 00:04:56.087
No matter what, I'm
still a happy cat.
