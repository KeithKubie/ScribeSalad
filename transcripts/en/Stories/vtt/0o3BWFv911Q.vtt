00:00:01.170 --> 00:00:03.980
SPEAKER 1: More effective
than drones or thermal optics,

00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:06.690
a group known as the black
mambas were recently awarded

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:09.080
as the champions of the Earth.

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:11.820
They protect wildlife from
dangerous poachers within one

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:15.870
of Africa's largest game
reserves, Kruger National Park.

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:19.650
The group doesn't use any
weapons and they're all women.

00:00:23.907 --> 00:00:26.950
They say it's hard for a
woman to do that kind of job.

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:30.440
That's a man's job, so
because I was happy about it,

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:32.117
I proved them wrong.

00:00:32.117 --> 00:00:33.700
CRAIG SPENCER: Our
attitude is to make

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:36.520
this the most undesirable
and unprofitable and most

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:38.995
uncomfortable place to poach.

00:00:38.995 --> 00:00:42.319
To the members will take them
quickly and chase and put

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:43.860
what we call a
disruptive [INAUDIBLE]

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:45.940
so that the poachers
run away and just don't

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:47.424
get close to the rhinos.

00:00:47.424 --> 00:00:49.090
SPEAKER 1: The Black
Mambas were created

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:52.270
after the reserve lost 19
rhinos in a period of only

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:53.043
a few months.

00:00:56.485 --> 00:00:58.360
AMY CLARK: The Black
Mamba anti-poaching unit

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:02.050
was first founded in 2013.

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:07.310
Snaring dropped 97% in the
first year, in this region.

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:10.000
their first 13
months of operation,

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.160
we didn't lose a single
rhino throughout the reserve.

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:19.019
Still even till today in
2016, it has dropped by 56%.

00:01:19.019 --> 00:01:20.560
SPEAKER 1: Craig
Spencer was in favor

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:23.585
of a model that did not entirely
rely on weapons or violence.

00:01:23.585 --> 00:01:25.960
CRAIG SPENCER: It's a bit like
the British policing model

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:27.329
with the bobbies on the beat.

00:01:27.329 --> 00:01:29.620
We need the people that walk
the beat every single day,

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:31.750
so they develop this sort
of institutional memory,

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:32.359
I call it.

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:33.400
Everybody must know them.

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:35.858
People must feel comfortable
to approach them and give them

00:01:35.858 --> 00:01:37.960
information, ask them
questions about things.

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:40.890
Women are, in my opinion,
much better at that.

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:41.930
Because they observe.

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:46.470
AMY CLARK: So we've
got the rangers that

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:48.569
are the boots on the ground.

00:01:48.569 --> 00:01:50.110
LEITAH MKHABELA:
We're also listening

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:51.520
when we're doing first patrol.

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:53.924
If we can hear anything
suspicious or related

00:01:53.924 --> 00:01:56.960
to the poachers and the
vehicles outside the reserve

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:58.900
that are walking
on the main roads.

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:01.825
When we do sweeping, we are
looking for snares and tracks

00:02:01.825 --> 00:02:02.790
and poacher's cams.

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:05.280
We are following
fresh tracks that

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:09.580
leads us to fresh snares
that can kill any animal.

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:11.440
AMY CLARK: So if
they find a problem,

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:14.240
they'll report it on the
radio to the operations room.

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:16.790
And they'll take the
next step further.

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:21.250
Either to call in an armed unit
or just notify the supervisors.

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:23.000
SPEAKER 1: New members
of the Black Mambas

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.020
begin with four weeks
of intensive training

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:28.900
on arrest procedures,
sporting tracks,

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:30.514
searching vehicles, and more.

00:02:30.514 --> 00:02:31.930
AMY CLARK: During
that four weeks,

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:33.640
they'll also spend
a week learning

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:37.870
how to act if they walk into a
lion or a walk into an elephant

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:40.160
and what to do to
keep themselves safe.

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:42.170
And then at the end
of that four weeks,

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:44.636
they do a two-week
paramilitary course.

00:02:44.636 --> 00:02:46.510
LEITAH MKHABELA: The
training very much hard.

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:47.460
Do you trust yourself?

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:48.610
Are you patient?

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:49.930
Are you strong?

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:52.682
Do you want to empower women?

00:02:52.682 --> 00:02:53.765
SPEAKER 2: Faster, faster.

00:02:53.765 --> 00:02:55.266
SPEAKER 3: Let's go, let's go!

00:02:55.266 --> 00:02:57.640
SPEAKER 1: And that was one
of the motivations for Leitah

00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:59.380
to become a Black Mamba.

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:02.170
As a patrolling officer
for the past two years,

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:04.960
she believes that their
success is reshaping roles

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:07.870
for women in communities
where job opportunities can

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:08.570
be limited.

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:11.920
AMY CLARK: All the Mamba's are
between the ages of 20 and 30

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:14.950
and then they're all from the
local communities and villages

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:17.260
surrounding the
Balule Nature Reserve.

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:19.620
The majority of them when,
when they first arrived,

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:23.260
were very shy and didn't
really speak out much.

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:25.750
After the time that
they've spent with us

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:28.150
and doing the job,
their confidence levels

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:30.340
have absolutely skyrocketed.

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:31.840
LEITAH MKHABELA:
This job teaches me

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:35.090
how to take care of money,
how to behave when you are

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:36.680
a woman working for yourself.

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:38.470
It makes me grow up.

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:42.184
In a lot of ways,
this job changed me.

00:03:42.184 --> 00:03:44.350
SPEAKER 1: One of the
fundamental goals of the Black

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:47.350
Mambas program is more
than just protecting.

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:50.170
It's also about educating
and changing the community's

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:52.210
attitude about wildlife.

00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:55.340
Lewyn Maefala is the Black
Mamba's education officer

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:57.349
who works with the
nearby communities.

00:03:57.349 --> 00:03:59.140
LEWYN MAEFALA: We bring
in the Black Mambas

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:01.900
into the classroom, whereby they
teach the learners about what

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:03.700
they do in the field.

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:07.870
They don't know of that role
of animals in the environment.

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:10.050
They don't know animals
boost our economy.

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:13.300
What they know is those
animals, all of them

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:14.620
are there to kill them.

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:20.200
And for me, it allows me to
say no, it's not like that.

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:21.970
They have a very important job.

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:25.962
And we need you guys to help
us to save these animals.

00:04:25.962 --> 00:04:27.920
CRAIG SPENCER: The Greater
Kruger National Park

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:29.740
is three million
hectares in total.

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:31.250
This is our unique treasure.

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:32.110
This is our Louvre.

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:34.900
People from around the world
been visiting it for 160 years.

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:36.100
We don't want to lose that.

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:37.933
We want the people on
the boundaries of here

00:04:37.933 --> 00:04:39.040
to feel that as well.

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:40.498
LEWYN MAEFALA:
There was one child,

00:04:40.498 --> 00:04:42.815
the one who was just
here, [? Nahnahl, ?] she

00:04:42.815 --> 00:04:46.180
was the one who said in front of
everyone that, when I grew up,

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:49.660
I want to be like you,
because you teach us

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:51.040
to look after our environment.

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:53.530
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:05:00.229 --> 00:05:02.020
SPEAKER 1: To learn
how a herd of elephants

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:05.147
are protecting rhinos in
Nepal, watch this next episode.

00:05:05.147 --> 00:05:06.730
SPEAKER 4: When a
rhino is discovered,

00:05:06.730 --> 00:05:07.646
they will communicate.

00:05:07.646 --> 00:05:10.720
Then the elephants will move
in, in a circular formation

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:14.204
around the rhino, to keep
it from running away.

00:05:14.204 --> 00:05:16.120
SPEAKER 1: Thanks for
watching Seeker Stories.

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:19.950
