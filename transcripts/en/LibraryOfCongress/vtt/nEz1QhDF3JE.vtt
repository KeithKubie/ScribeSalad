thank you it's it's kind of interesting
to talk for the first time about a new

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:36.270
book and to try to answer some of the
questions that kids always have I'm

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:43.710
going to start by telling you about a
day in my life when I was eight years

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:50.220
old this is an answer to the question of
how I knew I wanted to be a writer and

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:57.409
when and it was certainly a very long
time ago so picture me eight years old

00:01:57.409 --> 00:02:05.490
and I had a little brother who was - I
also had a bedroom that had a desk in it

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:09.810
and desks have always been my favorite
piece of furniture this is still true

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:15.900
today the stuff I like best is the
things that are in a desk drawer I think

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:21.810
of that as desk stuff and when in the
days when I was eight that would have

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:32.239
consisted of pencils paper crayons
scissors paste paper clips desk stuff

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:38.600
on a particular day when I was 8 I
wandered into my bedroom and discovered

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:43.700
that my little brother aged 2 had gone
into my room when nobody was looking and

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:49.460
had opened the drawers of my desk and
messed up my stuff it was all over the

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:55.000
floor of my bedroom all of that stuff
that was so dear to me and I was furious

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:01.340
there was my little brother and his
overalls playing with my desk stuff and

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:08.390
in my anger I picked up a tube of glue
the kind of tube of glue I don't know if

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:14.810
this still exists that has a metal screw
on the end that you undo and the glue is

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:21.830
it's the kind of stuff we must never
sniff okay and I grabbed that from my

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:28.090
brother and opened it up and I smeared
the back of my brother's hand with glue

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:36.350
and it dried almost immediately into a
shiny crust on the back of his hand and

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:42.260
I stopped being angry at him because it
was so interesting to look at that he

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:47.030
and I both looked at that little chubby
hand with now all the shiny stuff on it

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:53.600
and then I tried to take it off and it
wouldn't come off there was my brother

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:59.989
with his hand forever encased in shiny
glue okay now jump ahead a couple of

00:03:59.989 --> 00:04:05.530
hours and my mother says to me would you
take Johnny for a walk in the stroller

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:10.280
okay that was something I did often we
lived in a small town in Pennsylvania it

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:17.419
was very safe in those days probably
still is and so my mother buckled my

00:04:17.419 --> 00:04:20.060
brother into his stroller and off we
went

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:27.330
Johnny and I down the street
I was the kind of kid and all writers

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:32.970
are this kind of person who as I was
doing something would also be telling

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:41.400
the story of it to myself so that flying
down here yesterday I was probably in

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:47.460
the Boston Airport saying the author was
going to fly to Washington for the Book

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:51.990
Festival she was waiting at the gate for
her plane that's just the kind of thing

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:57.930
I do i narrate my life and I have always
done this so when I was eight years old

00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:02.729
pushing the stroller down Moreland
Avenue in Carlisle Pennsylvania I was

00:05:02.729 --> 00:05:08.280
saying to myself the little girl was
taking her baby brother for a walk she

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:15.360
was a good child helpful to her mother I
was usually the heroine in my own

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:22.889
narrated stories sometimes my mother was
in a villain her mother her lazy mother

00:05:22.889 --> 00:05:28.289
made her take the baby for a walk but
not always sometimes she was helpful to

00:05:28.289 --> 00:05:33.210
her mother who was tired that afternoon
anyway this story was going on in my

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:40.650
mind as we walked down Moreland Avenue
coming toward me I saw to what I thought

00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:47.159
of as old ladies they may have been 40
but I was only eight maybe they were 85

00:05:47.159 --> 00:05:50.880
I don't know they seemed like old ladies
and they were walking together toward me

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:54.930
and I'd never seen them before I didn't
know who they were but I could see their

00:05:54.930 --> 00:05:59.909
faces light up as they saw me coming
because it was kind of cute to see a

00:05:59.909 --> 00:06:04.500
little girl taking her baby brother for
a walk and as they approached they

00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:09.719
stopped and I stopped and they admired
my little brother sitting there in his

00:06:09.719 --> 00:06:14.940
blue corduroy jacket and then suddenly
one of these ladies reached down and

00:06:14.940 --> 00:06:20.029
picked up my brother's little hand and
looked at it and said to her a friend

00:06:20.029 --> 00:06:24.889
this child has been badly burned

00:06:24.970 --> 00:06:34.790
and I knew exactly what I should say I
should say no I put glue on his hand but

00:06:34.790 --> 00:06:40.820
what happened was in telling the story
to myself the little girl was taking the

00:06:40.820 --> 00:06:45.260
baby for a walk
I realized instantly that it was a

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:54.320
better story if it was the little girl
was taking the badly burned baby for a

00:06:54.320 --> 00:07:04.130
walk and so I I changed my smile that I
had prepared into a sad look and I

00:07:04.130 --> 00:07:13.310
nodded and agreed yes badly burned now
there's no ending to this story if I

00:07:13.310 --> 00:07:17.210
were writing it it would have to that
would be the middle part and it would

00:07:17.210 --> 00:07:21.620
have to have some interesting twist at
the ending but it doesn't because it's

00:07:21.620 --> 00:07:27.050
just a real-life incident it's an
anecdote and when I got home the glue

00:07:27.050 --> 00:07:32.750
eventually wore off my brother's hand
the old ladies didn't call a child abuse

00:07:32.750 --> 00:07:39.620
hotline and report me I there was
there's no ending except that it made me

00:07:39.620 --> 00:07:44.630
aware as I've always been aware since
and maybe had been aware before then how

00:07:44.630 --> 00:07:51.110
a story becomes interesting how the
little bits and pieces you add to it the

00:07:51.110 --> 00:07:57.770
badly burned baby becomes an interesting
story and how how essential the words

00:07:57.770 --> 00:08:04.610
are that you put in to make it do that
okay now I'm gonna jump ahead many many

00:08:04.610 --> 00:08:11.840
years from the time I was 8 I wanted to
be a writer 10 12 14 16 I went to

00:08:11.840 --> 00:08:15.800
college with a special scholarship to
study writing because I had won some

00:08:15.800 --> 00:08:22.040
awards in high school but I dropped out
of college very young 19 and got married

00:08:22.040 --> 00:08:28.880
and my creative life took a different
form as I had a baby when I was 21 a

00:08:28.880 --> 00:08:35.270
baby when I was 22 a baby when I was 24
and a baby when I was 25 and so

00:08:35.270 --> 00:08:40.669
goal of being a writer was sort of put
on hold for a number of years but then I

00:08:40.669 --> 00:08:45.550
went back to college when my kids start
at school and I started writing again I

00:08:45.550 --> 00:08:52.220
was writing however for adults I saw
myself as somebody who would write

00:08:52.220 --> 00:08:59.510
novels for grown-ups I was a grown-up
after all but it wasn't happening I was

00:08:59.510 --> 00:09:03.350
writing things and sending them off to
publishers and I was getting rejection

00:09:03.350 --> 00:09:10.700
letters and I was also at the same time
raising my children okay now it's 1975

00:09:10.700 --> 00:09:16.670
and you have to do some math I can't do
it quickly I was born in 1937 so it's

00:09:16.670 --> 00:09:27.860
now 1975 that makes me how old late 30s
saying and one morning my husband had

00:09:27.860 --> 00:09:32.149
gone off to work the kids had gone off
to catch the school bus and I was alone

00:09:32.149 --> 00:09:37.640
in the house and the dog was out in the
backyard it was November and I went

00:09:37.640 --> 00:09:45.260
outside to scrape some leftover
scrambled eggs into the dog's dish and I

00:09:45.260 --> 00:09:52.790
stopped when I got outside because there
was something about the smell of the air

00:09:52.790 --> 00:10:01.279
that triggered a memory that's that
happens to us a smell a sound it will

00:10:01.279 --> 00:10:05.390
sometimes bring back something that you
had forgotten that had happened many

00:10:05.390 --> 00:10:11.870
years before so there I stood on the
back porch of a house in Maine in early

00:10:11.870 --> 00:10:16.279
November what could I have been smelling
I was smelling the children's Halloween

00:10:16.279 --> 00:10:22.510
pumpkins rotting still on the porch
I was smelling dead leaves on the ground

00:10:22.510 --> 00:10:29.149
wood smoke I think coming from neighbors
chimneys apples still hanging in the

00:10:29.149 --> 00:10:35.420
apple trees though now they were turning
brown a kind of sweet smell of rotting

00:10:35.420 --> 00:10:45.470
apples all of it combined and I remember
today in nineteen probably 46 maybe 45 I

00:10:45.470 --> 00:10:50.090
would have been eight or
years old and I went back into the house

00:10:50.090 --> 00:10:58.850
and I went to my typewriter this is long
before computers 1975 and I sat down and

00:10:58.850 --> 00:11:04.310
I began to write about that day and the
sentence I wrote was it was morning

00:11:04.310 --> 00:11:14.270
early barely light cold for November I
was nine and the war was over in the car

00:11:14.270 --> 00:11:19.910
i sat next to the stranger who was my
father now I'm going to stop for a

00:11:19.910 --> 00:11:25.190
minute there to describe something in
almost every book or story that I've

00:11:25.190 --> 00:11:30.230
ever written I have begun by introducing
a character who will be the main

00:11:30.230 --> 00:11:35.990
character the one you want the reader to
care about a little about where that

00:11:35.990 --> 00:11:42.410
character is the setting and then there
will be a sentence a word or a phrase

00:11:42.410 --> 00:11:48.110
that will let the reader know that
something is not quite right something

00:11:48.110 --> 00:11:54.500
is askew and I'm just gonna veer off to
describe a couple of my own books that

00:11:54.500 --> 00:11:58.730
you may be familiar with number the
Stars is one begins the main character

00:11:58.730 --> 00:12:06.980
is running down a street blond hair
flying and then few paragraphs on

00:12:06.980 --> 00:12:12.350
there's a soldier with a gun and he says
halt of course you know something's

00:12:12.350 --> 00:12:18.440
wrong what's wrong okay another book the
first sentence is it was almost December

00:12:18.440 --> 00:12:23.420
and Jonas was beginning to be frightened
okay you know this book is going to be

00:12:23.420 --> 00:12:27.680
about a boy he has a boys name his name
is Jonas very soon you'll know his age

00:12:27.680 --> 00:12:32.150
and where he is but in the first
sentence you know something's wrong he

00:12:32.150 --> 00:12:38.720
was beginning to be frightened in this
story that I was then just typing out in

00:12:38.720 --> 00:12:45.170
my own typewriter the the little thing
that's asked you is in that second

00:12:45.170 --> 00:12:50.350
sentence that I quoted in the car I sat
next to the stranger who was my father

00:12:50.350 --> 00:12:56.570
it's it's something's wrong if the
father is a stranger okay this goes back

00:12:56.570 --> 00:13:00.800
to my childhood in
in the 1940s my father a career army

00:13:00.800 --> 00:13:08.209
officer had spent the war in the Pacific
and now he had come home as it turned

00:13:08.209 --> 00:13:12.320
out he was home only briefly because he
had to go back to Tokyo and eventually

00:13:12.320 --> 00:13:17.240
we would join him there but now he's
home for the first time in a very long

00:13:17.240 --> 00:13:25.519
time and I was a kid and I had missed my
father and I loved my father but when he

00:13:25.519 --> 00:13:29.209
came home I didn't know my father he was
a stranger to me

00:13:29.209 --> 00:13:36.500
and I was frightened would be too strong
a word but I was self-conscious and

00:13:36.500 --> 00:13:43.100
nervous around him he was a stranger to
me looking back now I can realize as a

00:13:43.100 --> 00:13:48.079
parent myself that he would have felt
the same way I was a stranger to him and

00:13:48.079 --> 00:13:53.480
so we were we were two people who were
in the position of having to get to know

00:13:53.480 --> 00:13:59.600
one another again so I wrote the story
of that day it's a story that takes

00:13:59.600 --> 00:14:03.560
place over the course of simply a few
hours and like all stories it has a

00:14:03.560 --> 00:14:11.449
beginning a middle and an end it has
people who go out on a journey not all

00:14:11.449 --> 00:14:16.850
journeys are Geographic ones but in this
story the child and her father start out

00:14:16.850 --> 00:14:19.579
in a car they're going out and they will
return

00:14:19.579 --> 00:14:26.720
I finished the writing of that and I
sent it off to a magazine a grown-up

00:14:26.720 --> 00:14:31.610
magazine I wasn't writing for kids then
I was writing for grownups and the

00:14:31.610 --> 00:14:39.740
magazine bought it and published it in
their December 1975 edition when that

00:14:39.740 --> 00:14:46.130
was published a children's book editor
read this story wrote to me and said you

00:14:46.130 --> 00:14:50.300
sound like somebody who could be writing
for kids would you consider writing a

00:14:50.300 --> 00:14:55.190
novel for young people and with that
invitation I did write my first book for

00:14:55.190 --> 00:15:02.480
kids but that had never been what what I
had intended it surprises me now I had

00:15:02.480 --> 00:15:07.040
four kids I read to my kids we had kids
books in the house but I'd never thought

00:15:07.040 --> 00:15:10.040
of myself
children's book writer but it was that

00:15:10.040 --> 00:15:17.480
adult story that propelled me into my
first book and from then to I think now

00:15:17.480 --> 00:15:26.290
35 books okay a couple of years ago or
maybe a year ago I forgotten how long a

00:15:26.290 --> 00:15:32.600
children's book editor heard me talk
about that story and contacted me and

00:15:32.600 --> 00:15:38.600
said could I read it so I provided her
with the entire story incidentally when

00:15:38.600 --> 00:15:44.060
I went to get a copy of that story at
the Boston Public Library I mean years

00:15:44.060 --> 00:15:46.459
had passed I didn't have a copy of it
anymore

00:15:46.459 --> 00:15:52.160
I went to the Boston library to find an
old copy event magazine which they did

00:15:52.160 --> 00:15:57.050
have and there was the story and I went
to Xerox it they said sorry you can't do

00:15:57.050 --> 00:16:06.620
that that's copyrighted but I wrote it
that's my name and eventually they let

00:16:06.620 --> 00:16:14.480
me but I think it was illegal anyway so
I gave Andre Pinkney the copy of the

00:16:14.480 --> 00:16:21.199
story and she asked permission to turn
it into a picture book for kids although

00:16:21.199 --> 00:16:27.790
it's not really a story just for kids
it's a story for all ages then her job

00:16:27.790 --> 00:16:33.860
was to turn it into the picture book
that is here today and incidentally it's

00:16:33.860 --> 00:16:37.220
not even officially published yet I
believe you can buy it at the

00:16:37.220 --> 00:16:43.809
booksellers tent but you'll be the first
because it's not really out as they say

00:16:43.809 --> 00:16:49.759
one of the things she needed to do after
she and I talked about a a few minor

00:16:49.759 --> 00:16:55.670
very small changes she wanted the child
in the book to have a name and it's told

00:16:55.670 --> 00:16:59.870
in the first person and so when I'd
first written it I didn't give that

00:16:59.870 --> 00:17:07.309
child a name she was me after all but in
in the book I've named myself Lizzie and

00:17:07.309 --> 00:17:11.390
I think there were a few other very
minor changes but not very many but then

00:17:11.390 --> 00:17:15.500
the really important thing this being a
picture book is she had to find the

00:17:15.500 --> 00:17:19.810
right illustrator
and magically she did that now the

00:17:19.810 --> 00:17:24.190
author and the illustrator very rarely
meet each other and I have never met the

00:17:24.190 --> 00:17:30.930
man who illustrated this book but he and
I corresponded a little bit by email and

00:17:30.930 --> 00:17:36.250
one of the things he wanted from me was
a description of the shirt that I was

00:17:36.250 --> 00:17:42.190
wearing in the book and I'll read you a
passage which will will tell you what he

00:17:42.190 --> 00:17:49.480
was looking for he also had a photograph
of me at that age and so the child in

00:17:49.480 --> 00:17:54.760
the book in the pictures is me she looks
like me at that age I wish I had thought

00:17:54.760 --> 00:17:58.360
to give him a photograph of my father
because the father in the book doesn't

00:17:58.360 --> 00:18:02.490
look like a my dad but that's okay all
right

00:18:02.490 --> 00:18:09.810
it's morning early barely light cold for
November that's the first sentence the

00:18:09.810 --> 00:18:17.380
first sentence of the original story was
I just sent it to you a minute ago and

00:18:17.380 --> 00:18:23.350
now my mind has gone blank it was
morning early barely light cold for

00:18:23.350 --> 00:18:28.300
November I was 9 and the war was over
the sentence is shorter and it doesn't

00:18:28.300 --> 00:18:32.830
say that I was 9 it never says in the
book how old the child is but you can

00:18:32.830 --> 00:18:37.960
tell from looking her at her that she's
about that that age at home in the bed

00:18:37.960 --> 00:18:43.960
next to mine Jessica my older sister
still sleeps but my bed is empty it's

00:18:43.960 --> 00:18:49.150
been changed to be present tense instead
of the past tense okay

00:18:49.150 --> 00:18:55.240
getting to the shirt in a minute I said
shyly in the front seat of the car next

00:18:55.240 --> 00:19:01.240
to the stranger who is my father my legs
pulled up under the two large wool shirt

00:19:01.240 --> 00:19:08.910
I am wearing mmm I practiced his name to
myself whispering it under my breath

00:19:08.910 --> 00:19:19.840
daddy daddy saying it feels new the war
has lasted so long he has been gone so

00:19:19.840 --> 00:19:26.320
long I realized and in talking to people
after this was going to be published

00:19:26.320 --> 00:19:33.250
that although this was World War two
the war of my childhood it could have

00:19:33.250 --> 00:19:38.440
been any war it could have been the
Korean war the war of my adolescence

00:19:38.440 --> 00:19:44.020
when my father again was gone it could
have been the Vietnam War and it could

00:19:44.020 --> 00:19:51.940
have been today today's children will
have this many of them have the same

00:19:51.940 --> 00:19:58.440
experience of having a parent father or
mother gone for so long

00:19:58.440 --> 00:20:07.180
daddy I say and now you can see close-up
the child wearing of the shirt he had

00:20:07.180 --> 00:20:12.250
written to me the illustrator to ask me
about the colors in the shirt it's very

00:20:12.250 --> 00:20:20.680
hard to describe a plaid I told him
there were red and blue and when they

00:20:20.680 --> 00:20:26.260
crossed that became a muted purple and
then there were black lines like window

00:20:26.260 --> 00:20:30.700
panes across that and he's done it
exactly bring us seeing that the

00:20:30.700 --> 00:20:35.860
paintings reminds me exactly I don't
know what became of the shirt I wore it

00:20:35.860 --> 00:20:42.450
for years it was so large Danny I say I
never I've never gone hunting before

00:20:42.450 --> 00:20:48.430
what if I don't know what to do
my father had taken me out for a day

00:20:48.430 --> 00:20:53.290
just an outing but with the two of us
and perhaps he did the same thing with

00:20:53.290 --> 00:20:56.920
my sister I don't know when my sister
died young so I never have had a chance

00:20:56.920 --> 00:21:03.700
to ask her he made probably a poor
choice my father was a hunter

00:21:03.700 --> 00:21:09.370
this was Pennsylvania it was fall
hunting season and so he took me hunting

00:21:09.370 --> 00:21:14.590
and that in addition to my being scared
of him I was now scared of what we were

00:21:14.590 --> 00:21:20.020
about to do well Lizzie says I've been
thinking about that and I've decided to

00:21:20.020 --> 00:21:25.390
put you in charge of the crow call have
you ever operated a crow call I shake my

00:21:25.390 --> 00:21:30.610
head no it's an art he says no doubt
about that but I'm pretty sure you can

00:21:30.610 --> 00:21:35.600
handle it some people will blow and blow
on a crow call and not a sing

00:21:35.600 --> 00:21:41.030
crow will even wake up or bother to
listen much less answer but I'm I really

00:21:41.030 --> 00:21:46.910
think you can do it of course he said
chuckling having that shirt will help

00:21:46.910 --> 00:21:52.580
and then there's a wonderful picture of
my father and me at a men's clothing

00:21:52.580 --> 00:21:57.830
store I think when my father came home
at that time to Pennsylvania he was

00:21:57.830 --> 00:22:04.940
wearing civilian a uniform excuse me and
so he went in town and took me with him

00:22:04.940 --> 00:22:12.350
to a men's clothing store to buy himself
some civilian clothes in town it says to

00:22:12.350 --> 00:22:15.919
buy groceries I think we were really
there to buy him some clothes he had

00:22:15.919 --> 00:22:20.390
noticed my hesitating in front of
kronenberg's window the plan hunting

00:22:20.390 --> 00:22:22.909
shirts had been in the store window for
a month

00:22:22.909 --> 00:22:26.870
the popular red and black and green and
black ones toward the front

00:22:26.870 --> 00:22:32.630
clothing mannequins holding duck decoys
but my shirt the rainbow plaid hung

00:22:32.630 --> 00:22:37.100
separately on a wooden hanger toward the
back of the display I had lingered in

00:22:37.100 --> 00:22:41.929
front of the window every chance I had
since the hunting shirts had appeared my

00:22:41.929 --> 00:22:46.880
sister rolled her eyes in disdain daddy
she pointed out to him as we entered the

00:22:46.880 --> 00:22:52.820
store that's a man's shirt the salesman
had smiled and said dubiously I don't

00:22:52.820 --> 00:22:58.429
quite think you know Lizzy my father had
said to me as the salesman wrapped the

00:22:58.429 --> 00:23:03.320
shirt buying this shirt is probably a
very practical thing to do you will

00:23:03.320 --> 00:23:09.620
never ever outgrow this shirt and indeed
you can see on the cover the child is

00:23:09.620 --> 00:23:14.900
wearing this enormous shirt as I did
that day with my father but then there

00:23:14.900 --> 00:23:19.850
we are out in that countryside early
morning by ourselves in the fall me

00:23:19.850 --> 00:23:24.590
wearing the big shirt me holding the
crow call which he's taught me to blow

00:23:24.590 --> 00:23:30.289
into to make the sound of a crow to
attract crows and he carrying the gun

00:23:30.289 --> 00:23:37.010
with which he is going to shoot them
it's a terrifying period of time for me

00:23:37.010 --> 00:23:40.860
though as the story moves along you'll
see that it ends

00:23:40.860 --> 00:23:45.420
happily and we're moving along in time
here too and I promised I would leave

00:23:45.420 --> 00:23:51.120
time for you to ask questions and so
maybe now is the time that some of you

00:23:51.120 --> 00:23:55.440
could be making your way up toward these
microphones on either side so that we

00:23:55.440 --> 00:24:00.230
can hear the questions anybody got one

00:24:01.040 --> 00:24:19.200
Jonas is alive by the way you don't need
to ask that question okay you know what

00:24:19.200 --> 00:24:21.809
even with your microphone I couldn't
hear it hold the microphone a little

00:24:21.809 --> 00:24:25.860
closer up how many books have you
written how many books have I written

00:24:25.860 --> 00:24:30.120
you know if you go to my website you'll
find a list of them and you can count

00:24:30.120 --> 00:24:35.460
and I'll try to count to next time I
look at it I think that I've written 35

00:24:35.460 --> 00:24:39.929
okay
my fifth grade teacher mrs. Anson we're

00:24:39.929 --> 00:24:45.299
reading gossamer Oh his teacher says in
his class they're reading gossamer I'm

00:24:45.299 --> 00:24:48.690
going to tell you a brief story about
that quite quite recently I have a

00:24:48.690 --> 00:24:56.610
grandson who's in sixth grade this year
but he told me this summer that in fifth

00:24:56.610 --> 00:25:01.410
grade last year his teacher read my book
gossamer to the classroom when my

00:25:01.410 --> 00:25:07.020
grandson told me that he was standing in
my kitchen and there is a section in

00:25:07.020 --> 00:25:12.210
that book where a little boy who has
been abused and taken away from his

00:25:12.210 --> 00:25:18.570
parents is finally describing what has
happened to him and it has happened in a

00:25:18.570 --> 00:25:21.780
kitchen
my grandson said to me you know when

00:25:21.780 --> 00:25:27.419
mrs. whatever her name was was reading
that he said this is the kitchen I saw

00:25:27.419 --> 00:25:31.710
in my mind he said I know nothing like
that ever happened in this kitchen but

00:25:31.710 --> 00:25:36.690
that's the kitchen I saw and it made me
aware that my grandson and every reader

00:25:36.690 --> 00:25:40.230
who is a passionate reader does this I
do it myself

00:25:40.230 --> 00:25:45.840
as you read or as you are read to you
create the pictures in your mind and

00:25:45.840 --> 00:25:49.480
that was the picture he created of his
grandmother's

00:25:49.480 --> 00:25:53.860
it made me know that he's a very
passionate reader I was thrilled to hear

00:25:53.860 --> 00:25:59.440
him say that okay who's next for the
question yep what is your favorite book

00:25:59.440 --> 00:26:04.710
do you mean my favorite book of the ones
that I've written

00:26:05.250 --> 00:26:11.380
hold the microphone your favorite book
of all every book in the whole world oh

00:26:11.380 --> 00:26:18.460
as a friend she was going to say that
actually one of my favorite books is one

00:26:18.460 --> 00:26:25.299
that I remember my mother reading to me
as a child and although I loved it and

00:26:25.299 --> 00:26:29.020
and really I loved it still and I've
gone back and reread it it was a book

00:26:29.020 --> 00:26:32.559
written for adults but my mother knew
how much I would love it because she

00:26:32.559 --> 00:26:37.660
knew me and that book was called the
yearling by Marjorie Kenton Rawlings and

00:26:37.660 --> 00:26:41.860
I suppose there's some of you out here
who know that book at the end of that

00:26:41.860 --> 00:26:46.809
book the very last paragraph and it's a
long book written and published for

00:26:46.809 --> 00:26:52.419
grownups very last paragraph the boy in
the book the one with whom I identified

00:26:52.419 --> 00:26:58.720
as my mother read it to me is now older
many things have happened to him and he

00:26:58.720 --> 00:27:03.309
has changed as characters in books do
and he's asleep in the end of the book

00:27:03.309 --> 00:27:07.450
and he wakes in the night because he
hears something thinks he hears

00:27:07.450 --> 00:27:12.520
something and it wakes him and there's
nothing there and then it says that he

00:27:12.520 --> 00:27:19.000
realized it was his own childhood voice
that he had heard and I love that

00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:24.190
passage which I've misquoted I'm sure
because I think it's what I listen to

00:27:24.190 --> 00:27:29.700
when I'm writing books my own childhood
voice is speaking to me all the time

00:27:29.700 --> 00:27:34.390
okay we have someone else with a
question where did you get the idea for

00:27:34.390 --> 00:27:36.790
The Giver
and do you ever wish you lived in the

00:27:36.790 --> 00:27:40.660
giver instead of this world tell me the
second half of that question again like

00:27:40.660 --> 00:27:44.380
just where did I get the idea for the
giver and you ever wish you lived in the

00:27:44.380 --> 00:27:48.429
world of the giver instead okay do I
ever wish I lived in the world of the

00:27:48.429 --> 00:27:54.880
giver you know the the idea for the
giver is the origin of the giver is very

00:27:54.880 --> 00:27:58.550
complicated and I'm
we don't have time to describe the many

00:27:58.550 --> 00:28:05.240
places it came from I'll just describe
very briefly that before I wrote the

00:28:05.240 --> 00:28:10.820
giver was a time when my father was very
old and in a nursing home in losing his

00:28:10.820 --> 00:28:16.160
memory and when I went to visit him I
became aware suddenly that he had

00:28:16.160 --> 00:28:20.090
forgotten my sister
he always recognized me until he died at

00:28:20.090 --> 00:28:25.580
92 but he had forgotten my sister my
sister had died young his first child

00:28:25.580 --> 00:28:30.830
and when I showed him a picture of her
he said what happened to her and I said

00:28:30.830 --> 00:28:36.530
she died dad and he was so saddened
because he had forgotten that and it was

00:28:36.530 --> 00:28:40.280
as if it was new to him
and so I changed the subject but within

00:28:40.280 --> 00:28:45.350
a few minutes he had said again whatever
happened to your sister and again I had

00:28:45.350 --> 00:28:50.110
to had to say she died dad and so when I
went home that day I remember

00:28:50.110 --> 00:28:55.730
specifically I began thinking what if
there was some kind of drug we could

00:28:55.730 --> 00:29:00.410
give people and they would forget every
bad thing that had ever happened and

00:29:00.410 --> 00:29:06.020
then when a writer begins to think what
if a story begins to take shape and I

00:29:06.020 --> 00:29:10.280
began to think about writing about a
group of people it became a community of

00:29:10.280 --> 00:29:16.160
people who had found a way to manipulate
human memory but my answer to would that

00:29:16.160 --> 00:29:20.870
be a good thing was of course no and
that's my answer to the second part of

00:29:20.870 --> 00:29:24.800
his question what I like to live in a
world that had become so comfortable

00:29:24.800 --> 00:29:33.500
that we had no no memories of the past
or of things that had happened to us and

00:29:33.500 --> 00:29:39.080
and of course Jonases world which I
tried very hard to make seem appealing

00:29:39.080 --> 00:29:44.000
at the fruit at the beginning of the
book has a has a dark underbelly to it

00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:47.840
and now nobody would want to live in a
world like that and certainly I would

00:29:47.840 --> 00:29:53.210
not okay somebody over here why is you
in the giver like that why did I end the

00:29:53.210 --> 00:29:55.720
giver like

00:29:58.279 --> 00:30:03.690
I always thought it was an optimistic
ending and it was after that I began to

00:30:03.690 --> 00:30:07.799
realize that some people thought the boy
was dead that I later went on to write

00:30:07.799 --> 00:30:13.919
two more books and the boy Jonas appears
seven years later as a man in the book

00:30:13.919 --> 00:30:19.080
messenger so it is a happy ending and
you'll see him later on and the baby

00:30:19.080 --> 00:30:28.679
Gabriel is also alive and well okay okay
sorry but I have a police woman down

00:30:28.679 --> 00:30:32.729
here is holding up the sign that says
I've gone over my time and so I'm not

00:30:32.729 --> 00:30:35.849
going to be able to answer any more
questions but thank you all for your

00:30:35.849 --> 00:30:46.320
patience this has been a presentation of
