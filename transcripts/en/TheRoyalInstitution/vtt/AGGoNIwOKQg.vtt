00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:19.600
If you children love cakes as much as my
daughter does this is a great activity

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:21.949
to teach in the basics of cake making

00:00:21.949 --> 00:00:27.250
and to get them thinking about the
chemistry of cooking.

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:33.600
You've probably heard dad in the kitchen

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:37.390
late at night with the microwave but I
found that what he's been doing.

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:41.100
He's been making these microwave mug cakes. Shall we give them a go?

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:44.180
Okay, these are the ingredients we
need

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:48.920
Four tablespoons plain flour.

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:52.720
Two tablespoons of castor sugar.

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:56.760
One quarter teaspoon baking powder.

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:58.740
One small egg.

00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:02.080
Two tablespoons vegetable oil.

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:04.340
Two tablespoons of water.

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:08.940
Stir vigorously with a fork.

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:13.130
Have we got our cake yet?No? What do you think we need to do to it

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:16.500
to make it into cake? Put it in the microwave?

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:20.039
Good plan. Before we do that, what do you
think would happen

00:01:20.039 --> 00:01:22.339
if we left out some of the ingredients?

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:26.860
I don't know but I  think it would be kind of similar to a cake.

00:01:26.869 --> 00:01:31.189
Do you think so? Shall we find out?

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:39.230
How about we could make some
different batches of cake mixture and

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:42.840
leave some different things out? What could we leave out?

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.910
Eggs, the oil,

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:50.080
baking powder.

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:53.090
Shall we take these to the microwave?

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:57.480
Mixing ingredients together gets them
ready to react with each other.

00:01:57.480 --> 00:02:01.570
The microwave provides the energy needed for the chemical reactions to take place

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:05.720
and turn the mixture into cake.

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:24.340
These are the cakes. We've taken them out of the mugs,

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:27.770
shall we take a look? This is our first one, with all the ingredients.

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:31.260
What do you think of that one? Feels like a nice cake.

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:34.569
Yeah, and a bit bouncy.

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:40.689
This is the one without the egg. How does this one look?

00:02:40.689 --> 00:02:45.069
Removing the egg made a crumbly cake. That's because the egg helps to hold

00:02:45.069 --> 00:02:46.459
the ingredients together.

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:49.980
Eggs contain long chain-like molecules which unravel

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:53.040
and form new hard and strong structures
when heated,

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:56.950
as you'll know if you have a fried or
boiled an egg. The cooked egg forms thin layers

00:02:56.950 --> 00:02:58.810
around the bubbles of gas,

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:03.620
trapping them as the cake cooks. This is the one without the baking powder.

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:06.680
How does this one look?

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:11.319
That bit has lost a bit, and that bit has collapsed.

00:03:11.319 --> 00:03:15.370
And the top looks like a Yorkshire pudding. Removing the baking powder 

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:20.060
gave us a cake that collapsed and isn't
very spongy. This is because baking powder

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:23.980
contains chemicals which produce
carbon dioxide gas.

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:27.420
this gas gets trapped in little pockets in
the cake as it cooks.

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:31.250
This is the one without the vegetable oil. How does that look?

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:35.370
Finally, removing the oil from the mixture gave us a very dry cake.

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:38.540
This is because without the oil to coat the other ingredients,

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:41.760
the mixture dries out when heating.

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:43.579
Daddy!

00:03:43.579 --> 00:03:46.719
Do you want to try the cake?

00:03:46.719 --> 00:03:50.319
They look a bit different!

00:03:50.319 --> 00:03:53.989
Because we haven't added one because

00:03:53.989 --> 00:03:57.359
we wanted to see how they would end up.

00:03:57.359 --> 00:04:00.599
