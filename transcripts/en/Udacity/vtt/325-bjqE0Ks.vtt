00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Let's have another look at the SIR Model to learn about

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
an important phenomenon and that's Herd Immunity.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000
On the right-hand side of the I equation, the factor I appears in every term.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
If we factor it out, this is what happens.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:19.000
This helps us to investigate what happens when a huge percentage of all persons is vaccinated.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
We model vaccination by taking persons from susceptible to recovered,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
which means that the number of susceptible person decreases

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
if the size of the population says constant.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:35.000
When the number of susceptible persons shrinks, the first term in the left parenthesis decreases

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:41.000
and eventually if you vaccinate enough people, the complete expression is going to become negative.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:46.000
The rate of change is negative, this means that the number of the infectious persons

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:51.000
is decreasing over the cause of time, more susceptible people get infected.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:58.000
The number of susceptible person decreases which means that this first term here gets even smaller

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.000
which means that the expression in the right parenthesis gets even more negative.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:07.000
The number of susceptible persons can only decrease

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000
when enough people have been vaccinated, we can never have an epidemic.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
This is called Herd Immunity.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:19.000
Not everybody is vaccinated, but if the number of people who are vaccinated is large enough,

00:01:19.000 --> 09:59:59.000
we can not have an epidemic nonetheless.
