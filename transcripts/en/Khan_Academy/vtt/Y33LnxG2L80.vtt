00:00:00.519 --> 00:00:01.973
- [Instructor] We finished the last video

00:00:01.973 --> 00:00:06.359
in the year 40 B.C.E.,
where the year began

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:10.744
with the Parthian invasion of
Syria in the eastern provinces

00:00:10.744 --> 00:00:13.688
of the Roman Republic, and
it really is an empire,

00:00:13.688 --> 00:00:16.152
the Roman Republic or the Roman Empire.

00:00:16.152 --> 00:00:19.079
But Marc Antony, who was
in control of the east

00:00:19.079 --> 00:00:22.239
of the empire, he wasn't able
to deal with it immediately

00:00:22.239 --> 00:00:25.238
because he goes to
Brundisium in order to take

00:00:25.238 --> 00:00:29.405
his wife's side on a civil
war between her and Octavian.

00:00:30.509 --> 00:00:32.985
Now, his wife dies and he
makes good with Octavian,

00:00:32.985 --> 00:00:34.267
in fact, so good with Octavian,

00:00:34.267 --> 00:00:37.787
he marries OCtavian's sister, Octavia,

00:00:37.787 --> 00:00:40.798
and they decide, alright, let's
continue to be friends here

00:00:40.798 --> 00:00:44.837
and they divide the Roman
Empire, the Roman Republic,

00:00:44.837 --> 00:00:46.873
whatever you wanna call it, between them,

00:00:46.873 --> 00:00:51.002
where Marc Antony keeps
control of the east,

00:00:51.002 --> 00:00:55.002
you now have Octavian
with control over the west

00:00:56.381 --> 00:00:58.457
and they gave Lepidus, who's always a bit

00:00:58.457 --> 00:01:00.944
of the third wheel here, they gave him

00:01:00.944 --> 00:01:05.375
some of the southern
provinces right over there.

00:01:05.375 --> 00:01:07.295
Now it seems like all is good,

00:01:07.295 --> 00:01:08.782
but as we've already talked about,

00:01:08.782 --> 00:01:12.220
the tension between Antony
and Octavian is there,

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:14.564
it was there from the
beginning and in this video,

00:01:14.564 --> 00:01:17.995
we're going to see that it
gets a lot, a lot worse.

00:01:17.995 --> 00:01:21.078
So Marc Antony goes back to the east,

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:26.185
where he starts planning
his invasion of Parthia,

00:01:26.185 --> 00:01:27.860
not only does he wanna
take back the territory

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:30.622
that they took in 40 B.C.E.,
but he actually wants

00:01:30.622 --> 00:01:35.243
to avenge them for
Crassus' death in 53 B.C.E.

00:01:35.243 --> 00:01:39.410
Julius Caesar had been
planning an invasion of Persia,

00:01:40.517 --> 00:01:43.441
and you have to remember,
after Alexander the Great,

00:01:43.441 --> 00:01:47.010
all of these western rulers,
especially the Romans,

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:49.350
they all had their sights
on Persia, they said,

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:51.975
"Hey, maybe I can be just
like Alexander the Great

00:01:51.975 --> 00:01:53.987
"and take over the Persians."

00:01:53.987 --> 00:01:58.468
So Marc Antony is planning
his invasion of Persia

00:01:58.468 --> 00:02:01.548
but he doesn't get the troops
that he wants from Octavian

00:02:01.548 --> 00:02:05.603
and so that starts to build
the tensions even further

00:02:05.603 --> 00:02:09.770
but he goes to his lover,
Cleopatra, who is the richest

00:02:11.218 --> 00:02:14.217
woman in the world, the
pharaoh of Egypt, and says,

00:02:14.217 --> 00:02:16.577
"Hey can you give me
some Egyptian troops?"

00:02:16.577 --> 00:02:20.410
And so he plans an
invasion of Parthian Persia

00:02:22.594 --> 00:02:26.094
with a combined Roman and Egyptian troops.

00:02:28.135 --> 00:02:31.716
Now unfortunately, that
is a failed invasion.

00:02:31.716 --> 00:02:35.383
As they try to make their
way in, they get pretty far,

00:02:35.383 --> 00:02:39.780
but they weren't able to
protect their supply lines

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:43.947
carefully and so the Parthians
are able to attack them,

00:02:44.872 --> 00:02:48.049
attack their supply
lines and while they do,

00:02:48.049 --> 00:02:51.959
the king of Armenia just kinda
doesn't really do anything

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:55.869
about it and so Marc
Antony is forced to retreat

00:02:55.869 --> 00:02:58.663
and so you can imagine, he's
not too happy about this.

00:02:58.663 --> 00:03:01.908
The Parthians in 40
B.C.E. were able to take

00:03:01.908 --> 00:03:05.435
all of this territory, in 36 B.C.E.,

00:03:05.435 --> 00:03:09.102
so now we are right
over here, in 36 B.C.E.,

00:03:13.516 --> 00:03:17.683
we have a failed revenge
invasion of the Parthians,

00:03:18.988 --> 00:03:21.625
he's betrayed by the Armenian king.

00:03:21.625 --> 00:03:23.149
Now the other thing that's happening

00:03:23.149 --> 00:03:26.265
is that Lepidus is now
out of the triumvirate.

00:03:26.265 --> 00:03:28.972
He tries to do a little bit of a land grab

00:03:28.972 --> 00:03:33.139
after him and Octavian go after
another governor in Sicily,

00:03:35.703 --> 00:03:37.254
but when they're successful,
when Lepidus tries

00:03:37.254 --> 00:03:39.804
to take control of Sicily,
Octavian says, "No no no no,

00:03:39.804 --> 00:03:41.899
"not only can you not do that,

00:03:41.899 --> 00:03:45.232
"but you're now out of the triumvirate."

00:03:46.207 --> 00:03:49.707
So 36 B.C.E. is a situation where Octavian

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:54.290
continues to try to consolidate
his power in the west,

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:58.457
Lepidus is now out, and
Marc Antony faces another,

00:04:00.119 --> 00:04:03.567
I guess you could say embarrassment
against the Parthians.

00:04:03.567 --> 00:04:05.817
So then we get to 33 B.C.E.

00:04:08.388 --> 00:04:12.555
So let's see, this is 33 B.C.E.
right over here on this map

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:18.656
and finally, he's able to
muster up enough of a force

00:04:18.656 --> 00:04:21.739
to take not revenge on the Parthians,

00:04:22.698 --> 00:04:25.305
but to take some of the
territory, but in particular,

00:04:25.305 --> 00:04:28.767
to take revenge on the Armenian king.

00:04:28.767 --> 00:04:32.480
And so Marc Antony, it's
his first win after awhile,

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:36.076
tries to make a lot of
this, and so when he goes,

00:04:36.076 --> 00:04:38.719
he goes back to Alexandria,
where of course his lover

00:04:38.719 --> 00:04:42.886
Cleopatra reigns, and there,
he has this big celebration

00:04:43.852 --> 00:04:45.648
to say, "Hey look, I went and was able

00:04:45.648 --> 00:04:49.004
"to take out the king of Armenia."

00:04:49.004 --> 00:04:53.171
Now this celebration, it rubs
the Romans in a wrong way

00:04:54.997 --> 00:04:56.681
on a whole bunch of dimensions.

00:04:56.681 --> 00:04:58.706
One, they never really like Cleopatra,

00:04:58.706 --> 00:05:02.329
they view her as a foreign
queen, they didn't like her

00:05:02.329 --> 00:05:05.136
when she was Julius Caesar's
lover, they definitely

00:05:05.136 --> 00:05:08.615
don't like her when she's
Marc Antony's lover,

00:05:08.615 --> 00:05:10.823
and they're kind of peeved that
he decides to go Alexandria

00:05:10.823 --> 00:05:13.883
and do this ceremonial victory party

00:05:13.883 --> 00:05:16.431
that typically only happened in Rome,

00:05:16.431 --> 00:05:17.807
it looks like this guy doesn't really

00:05:17.807 --> 00:05:19.879
even view himself as Roman anymore.

00:05:19.879 --> 00:05:21.682
He likes to go back to Alexandria.

00:05:21.682 --> 00:05:24.407
And the real salt that he rubbed,

00:05:24.407 --> 00:05:26.270
especially in Octavian's wounds,

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:29.117
was a speech he gave
which will later be known

00:05:29.117 --> 00:05:31.578
as the Donations of Alexandria.

00:05:31.578 --> 00:05:33.589
So what he starts doing
is putting his children,

00:05:33.589 --> 00:05:36.409
especially the children
that he has with Cleopatra,

00:05:36.409 --> 00:05:40.692
as the rulers of a lot
of the eastern provinces.

00:05:40.692 --> 00:05:44.645
But the worst thing that
he does, is in that speech,

00:05:44.645 --> 00:05:48.812
in the Donations of Alexandria,
this is in 33 B.C.E.,

00:05:50.495 --> 00:05:54.330
right over here, he declares
that Cleopatra's son

00:05:54.330 --> 00:05:56.982
that was apparently the
son of Julius Caesar,

00:05:56.982 --> 00:06:01.415
Caesarion, that he is the
rightful heir to Julius Caesar.

00:06:01.415 --> 00:06:03.775
Now, Octavian does not like this, he says,

00:06:03.775 --> 00:06:05.721
"Hey, I'm the adopted son,
I'm the rightful heir,

00:06:05.721 --> 00:06:08.363
"I don't like this Caesarion guy."

00:06:08.363 --> 00:06:12.962
And so for the next few
years, in 33 and 32 B.C.E.,

00:06:12.962 --> 00:06:14.645
so we're in this period on that timeline,

00:06:14.645 --> 00:06:17.418
we're in this period on this timeline,

00:06:17.418 --> 00:06:20.676
tensions start to get
a lot, lot, lot worse

00:06:20.676 --> 00:06:22.926
between Octavian and Marc Antony,

00:06:22.926 --> 00:06:26.509
they are publicly accusing
each other of not even being

00:06:26.509 --> 00:06:30.086
legitimate people with
legitimate authority,

00:06:30.086 --> 00:06:32.386
they are really starting
to question each other,

00:06:32.386 --> 00:06:34.403
they're really starting
to go at each other.

00:06:34.403 --> 00:06:37.320
And it all culminates in 31 B.C.E.,

00:06:40.412 --> 00:06:44.743
it all culminates in 31
B.C.E., so this is where we are

00:06:44.743 --> 00:06:48.976
right over here, with the
naval battle at Actium.

00:06:48.976 --> 00:06:52.370
And for the most part, and
Marc Antony and Cleopatra

00:06:52.370 --> 00:06:54.379
are both there, and
they're on their heels,

00:06:54.379 --> 00:06:57.046
they're surrounded by
the forces of Octavian,

00:06:57.046 --> 00:07:00.127
and the best that they can
hope for is just an escape

00:07:00.127 --> 00:07:03.710
and Antony and Cleopatra
are able to escape

00:07:04.986 --> 00:07:06.906
and it's very clear from that battle

00:07:06.906 --> 00:07:09.427
that they really only cared
about saving their own hides

00:07:09.427 --> 00:07:13.063
and their own wealth, and they
left the most of their navy,

00:07:13.063 --> 00:07:16.527
they returned with only
60 boats to Alexandria

00:07:16.527 --> 00:07:18.689
but they leave most of
their navy to kind of

00:07:18.689 --> 00:07:20.878
have to deal with the forces of Octavian.

00:07:20.878 --> 00:07:23.059
So they were already on their heels,

00:07:23.059 --> 00:07:25.772
they have this escape in 31 B.C.E.,

00:07:25.772 --> 00:07:29.377
many historians will call
the Battle of Actium,

00:07:29.377 --> 00:07:33.534
and this is a depiction of
the naval battle at Actium

00:07:33.534 --> 00:07:36.725
right over here, as the end, after this,

00:07:36.725 --> 00:07:40.718
there was no chance, really,
for Cleopatra and Marc Antony

00:07:40.718 --> 00:07:44.917
in any way, to rival Octavian,
that Octavian was now

00:07:44.917 --> 00:07:48.515
the real sole power in what is evolving

00:07:48.515 --> 00:07:51.848
from a Roman Republic to a Roman Empire.

00:07:52.731 --> 00:07:55.475
But Antony and Cleopatra,
maybe they didn't realize it

00:07:55.475 --> 00:07:59.825
as much, they go back to
Alexandria and continue to plot,

00:07:59.825 --> 00:08:02.673
seeing how they can get back at Octavian.

00:08:02.673 --> 00:08:04.529
So Octavian doesn't want much of this,

00:08:04.529 --> 00:08:08.696
so he decides to go attack
them in Alexandria in 30 B.C.E.

00:08:10.846 --> 00:08:14.230
And Antony tries to make a
last stand against Octavian

00:08:14.230 --> 00:08:17.982
but his soldiers really
aren't in the mood to fight

00:08:17.982 --> 00:08:21.252
so he goes back to the palace,
he looks for Cleopatra,

00:08:21.252 --> 00:08:24.370
Cleopatra gets one of her
servants to tell Marc Antony,

00:08:24.370 --> 00:08:26.192
'cause she has no mood to
see him, because who knows,

00:08:26.192 --> 00:08:29.865
he's raving mad, he might
wanna kill her or kill him,

00:08:29.865 --> 00:08:31.035
who knows what he might wanna do,

00:08:31.035 --> 00:08:34.252
Cleopatra had her servant tell Marc Antony

00:08:34.252 --> 00:08:38.305
that Cleopatra was dead
and so Marc Antony,

00:08:38.305 --> 00:08:41.101
he's already down, his
soldiers have deserted him,

00:08:41.101 --> 00:08:43.419
there's no way for him to take
on Octavian, he's essentially

00:08:43.419 --> 00:08:47.162
lost, and now Cleopatra, his
lover, is apparently dead.

00:08:47.162 --> 00:08:51.062
He stabs himself
repeatedly in the stomach.

00:08:51.062 --> 00:08:54.905
Now, Cleopatra finds out about
this and then she has Marc

00:08:54.905 --> 00:08:57.163
Antony brought to him, he
doesn't die immediately,

00:08:57.163 --> 00:08:58.713
stabbing yourself in the stomach is a way

00:08:58.713 --> 00:09:02.660
of having a very slow and painful death.

00:09:02.660 --> 00:09:05.660
And he dies essentially in her arms.

00:09:07.157 --> 00:09:10.536
And then Cleopatra is
taken, then, by the forces

00:09:10.536 --> 00:09:12.973
of Octavian, but then she too decides

00:09:12.973 --> 00:09:15.385
that she wants to commit
suicide or at least

00:09:15.385 --> 00:09:19.325
that's what most accounts say
and the most common account

00:09:19.325 --> 00:09:23.241
is that she gets a snake
smuggled into her rooms,

00:09:23.241 --> 00:09:27.028
a poisonous snake that she
taunts and gets to bite her,

00:09:27.028 --> 00:09:31.440
which allows her to die, so
both Cleopatra and Marc Antony

00:09:31.440 --> 00:09:34.023
die in 30 B.C.E., and Octavian now,

00:09:34.023 --> 00:09:37.222
really the main power, he kills Caesarion,

00:09:37.222 --> 00:09:40.396
who was Cleopatra's
son with Julius Caesar,

00:09:40.396 --> 00:09:44.850
as the only possible rival, and
so here we are on 30 B.C.E.,

00:09:44.850 --> 00:09:49.275
Octavian is victorious and
then he goes back to Rome

00:09:49.275 --> 00:09:52.227
and continues to consolidate his power.

00:09:52.227 --> 00:09:56.294
Until we get to 27 B.C.E.,
which is often marked

00:09:56.294 --> 00:09:59.203
as the beginning of the Roman Empire,

00:09:59.203 --> 00:10:03.112
when Octavian was given the name Augustus,

00:10:03.112 --> 00:10:05.860
which means illustrious
one, and from then on,

00:10:05.860 --> 00:10:09.136
he will continue to reign
with more and more and more

00:10:09.136 --> 00:10:11.537
power that he continues to consolidate

00:10:11.537 --> 00:10:14.870
for many, many, many, many more decades.
