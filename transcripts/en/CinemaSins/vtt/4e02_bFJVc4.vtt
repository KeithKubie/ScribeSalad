00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:09.300
What's up?

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:10.300
What's up?

00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:12.760
Saw Les Mis, I take it?

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:13.760
I did.

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:14.760
And?

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:18.040
What didn't you like?

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:23.070
Well, considering that it started yesterday
and I'm just getting home, I'm gonna go with

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:24.700
'It's too f*cking long,' for starters.

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:27.360
I'm starting to think you have an attention
span problem.

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:31.800
I'm sorry if my attention span can only tolerate
17 Hugh Jackman songs before it gives up.

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.941
Dude, it could have been a lot longer, they
didn't even shoot the whole play.

00:00:34.941 --> 00:00:39.480
'It could have been longer' is not a defense
against the criticism of 'It was too long.'

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.350
Okay, so what else didn't you like about it.

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:43.840
What about the speak-singing?

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:44.840
Speak-singing?

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:49.190
You know, how they don't say any lines of
dialogue.

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:56.039
Everything is sung, when they're speaking
Even if they're only saying hi.

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:00.370
It's a musical--
It's really f*cking stupid and it made me

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:02.649
really angry and it made me want to punch
them in the eye.

00:01:02.649 --> 00:01:04.820
You are a good songwriter, that's for sure.

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:07.130
They turn every line of dialoge into a song.

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:08.130
It's freaking dumb.

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:09.130
That's what musicals do.

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:13.980
That's what--
I need some milk my cereal is dry, could you

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:15.160
pass the milk-
You don't have any cereal

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:16.550
-to me.

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:18.780
What else didn't you like?

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:22.280
Alright, well, what's Russell Crowe doing
in this movie, and why does he sing like he

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:23.280
has to poop?

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:24.780
Come on, he's not that bad.

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:25.780
No, he's terrible.

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:26.970
Another problem, not enough sex.

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:28.180
This movie has a sex scene!

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:29.180
Yeah, with Anne Hatheway.

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:30.180
Right.

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:35.500
Listen, I only go to see Anne Hatheway movies
for two reasons: to see her naked.

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:38.660
That's not--
Boobies, I need those boobies.

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:39.690
Very mature.

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:42.140
When I go to the movies.

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:45.260
I don't even know why I bother talking with
you about movies because you--

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:46.260
Boobies.

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:47.260
Are you done?

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:48.260
Boobies.

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:49.260
Okay, I'm done now.

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:53.830
Why don't we talk about some of the--
What about the riot in the streets?

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:55.290
What about the riot in the streets?

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:56.990
Why does it have to feel so small?

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:58.060
What do you mean 'small?'

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:03.000
The movie makes you feel like it's some sort
of historical trigger event, but it's just

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.640
a bunch of teenagers that had too much beer
hiding out behind some chairs in an alley.

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:10.450
Why don't we talk about some of the positive
qualities of the movie--

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:11.450
There are none!

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:12.450
There are none.

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:13.450
This conversation is over.

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:14.640
You can't just end a conversation because
you--

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:18.300
Les Mis, Les Mis, the movie all in song.

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:25.840
Les Mis, Les Mis, it's f*cking 5 hours long.
