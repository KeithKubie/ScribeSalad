00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.740
Murder has inspired documenteries, podcasts, and even games.

00:00:04.780 --> 00:00:07.040
But our obsession with these stories got us wondering

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:12.240
Are there certain traits or factors that make somebody more likely to kill someone?

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:14.860
And are you capable of murder?

00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:17.680
To start have you ever thought about it before?

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:22.300
Well this isn't actually that meaningful because it's so common.

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:25.320
A survey of almost 1,000 students found that

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:29.400
76% of women and 91% of men reported having one

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:32.020
vivid and memorable homicidal thought.

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:36.280
In fact other reports show men may have roughly ten murder fantasies

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:38.400
and women three in the past year.

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:40.940
Is your heat beating fast right now?

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:42.480
Then you're probably safe.

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:46.160
A study of 710,000 menhad their resting heart

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:48.260
rate measured when they were 18 years old

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:50.280
as part of a military service test.

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:54.300
In the decades that followed the men with the lowest resting heart rates

00:00:54.300 --> 00:01:00.300
were 39% more likely than the high resting heart rate group to commit a violent crime.

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:03.740
Additionally a separate study found that  a low heart rate

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:05.840
was linked to stalking behavior.
