00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.340
This is Radiolab. I'm Jad and I'm Robert.

2
00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:06.480
Today's program is about sleep as in the kind of sleep where you pretend to

3
00:00:06.481 --> 00:00:10.470
dream. Exactly. Do you know that story about the um, the benzine molecule?

4
00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:13.900
No. Speaking of dreams. Hmm? Well yeah,

5
00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:19.340
here [inaudible] 1865 German chemist is trying to figure out the shape of this

6
00:00:19.921 --> 00:00:20.790
molecule. Benzine,

7
00:00:20.791 --> 00:00:23.220
he knows that has a certain amount of one kind of Adam and a certain amount of

8
00:00:23.221 --> 00:00:26.670
another, but he can't figure out how they all link up. Right.

9
00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:29.370
And he's tortured by this problem. Ghosts sleep. Yeah.

10
00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:33.840
Has a dream of a snake biting it's tail wakes up,

11
00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:37.960
bolts right up and says it's a rain. It's a real,

12
00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:42.240
do you believe that? I want to, well yeah, I mean don't get me wrong.

13
00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:45.550
I hate it when people tell me that dreams hate it. I want to stab up

14
00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:48.960
<v 1>my eye with a fork. And frankly, when people tell me that, I don't know why,</v>

15
00:00:48.961 --> 00:00:51.570
I never had to tell you about my dreams again, I'm good.

16
00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:56.070
But you know you're not alone because for a long time scientists have have

17
00:00:56.071 --> 00:01:00.600
avoided studying dreams cause they think they're so random and meaningless and

18
00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:04.890
unsuitable. Right. But we did meet a guy, I'm Bob Stick Gold,

19
00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:06.840
S. T. I. C. K. G. O. L. D.

20
00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:10.500
I'm an associate professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School.

21
00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:14.280
Who found an interesting way to ask the question, why do we dream?

22
00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:18.760
Simple question. Very hard answer. Robert.

23
00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:22.980
Stick gold was one of the first modern scientists to take dreams seriously.

24
00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:26.010
And for him it'd be actually began kind of by accident.

25
00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:27.150
I had been up in Vermont,

26
00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:30.470
<v 2>that's my family. We had gone and climbed camel's Hump,</v>

27
00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:33.860
one of the higher easy to climb mountains in Vermont.

28
00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:36.110
We'd gone at eight in the morning.

29
00:01:36.111 --> 00:01:39.680
We were back at two in the afternoon and for that whole day he'd been up

30
00:01:39.681 --> 00:01:43.160
climbing on the rocks, gripping them with his hands, really climbing.

31
00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:46.190
Later that night I lie down, I close my eyes

32
00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:48.993
<v 3>[inaudible]</v>

33
00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:52.720
<v 2>I can feel the rocks under my hands</v>

34
00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:58.900
and I started startle all up and I said, well that's really bizarre.

35
00:01:58.901 --> 00:02:03.130
It wasn't like I was thinking about it. I was there. I could feel the rock

36
00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:09.910
had been off the mountain for eight hours, nothing like that had happened.

37
00:02:09.911 --> 00:02:13.600
I lie down in bed for three minutes, starting to go to sleep and boom,

38
00:02:13.601 --> 00:02:17.740
it's there and I tried again and I fell asleep. Two hours later I wake up,

39
00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:20.230
I have to go to the bathroom and go to the bathroom. I come back and I say,

40
00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:22.480
that was way cool. I have to try that again.

41
00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:24.200
<v 3>[inaudible]</v>

42
00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:25.033
<v 1>wow,</v>

43
00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:26.590
<v 2>I cannot get it back.</v>

44
00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:31.450
What happened in those two hours to those memories that they won't intrude

45
00:02:31.451 --> 00:02:35.920
anymore? And then I started talking to friends and they say, oh,

46
00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:40.510
try try to Lewin or someone else says, try, try Whitewater rafting.

47
00:02:40.511 --> 00:02:42.940
If you want to get that and someone else's, oh, hello.

48
00:02:42.941 --> 00:02:47.941
Take organic chemistry and you go to bed at night and all you see are these

49
00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:51.100
bloody molecules rotating in front of your eyes.

50
00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:55.990
Those daytime activities are affecting your dreams and that guiding thinking,

51
00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:00.220
what exactly is the connection between what do during the day

52
00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:04.420
<v 0>and what you dream at night? What are the rules of that? He figured, all right,</v>

53
00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:07.240
well this replay is kind of interesting. Maybe I'll test it,

54
00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:10.870
but how if I get some subjects together,

55
00:03:10.871 --> 00:03:15.871
what could I have them do during the day that would reliably end up in their

56
00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:16.270
dreams?

57
00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:19.360
But you can't have them all go for a hike and I'm probably not going to get

58
00:03:19.361 --> 00:03:22.740
permission to take them Whitewater rafting. Too expensive. So what could he do?

59
00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:25.030
Sort of set fallow for a year.

60
00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:29.710
And I was moaning from some of my students about how I can't think of how to do

61
00:03:29.711 --> 00:03:31.870
this. And someone says tetris

62
00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:36.100
and somebody else says, absolutely

63
00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:42.950
<v 4>[inaudible].</v>

64
00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:47.350
<v 1>I'm saying, what? What? He say, well don't you play Tetris? And I say, yes.</v>

65
00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:48.730
Well when you start playing Tetris

66
00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:51.210
<v 4>[inaudible]</v>

67
00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:52.740
<v 0>is that when you start playing touches</v>

68
00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:55.090
<v 4>[inaudible]</v>

69
00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:55.980
<v 1>you go to bed at night,</v>

70
00:03:56.550 --> 00:04:00.390
you lie down in bed and you see tetris pieces falling down in front of your

71
00:04:00.391 --> 00:04:05.070
eyes. Sure, absolutely. Your eyeballs, you guys both know that?

72
00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:06.263
Oh yeah.

73
00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:12.470
I got a cover of Science magazine for the first published paper and dreaming in

74
00:04:12.781 --> 00:04:17.400
40 years because I discovered that and everybody already knew it.

75
00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:21.220
<v 4>[inaudible]</v>

76
00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:24.130
<v 1>it was that simple. He got a bunch of people, put them in a room,</v>

77
00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:25.120
had him play tetris.

78
00:04:25.121 --> 00:04:30.121
Later that night they woke up and 60% of them were dreaming of Tetris.

79
00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:32.640
60% how do you know that?

80
00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:36.400
I mean just from their report as they're falling asleep or monitoring them

81
00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:41.470
electro physiologically and as they start to drift off to sleep. Please report.

82
00:04:41.471 --> 00:04:43.840
Now I'm

83
00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:45.243
<v 0>filming</v>

84
00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:49.890
this tetris observation was a pretty good start in terms of getting at that

85
00:04:49.891 --> 00:04:52.920
question, why do we dream? Why we dream? How does it work?

86
00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:57.630
What if as a next step, instead of having the people report their own dreams,

87
00:04:57.631 --> 00:04:59.040
waking them up and doing that whole thing,

88
00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:02.940
what if instead you could cut the person out of the equation entirely and go

89
00:05:02.941 --> 00:05:07.710
right to the source, to the dream directly? Matt Wilson,

90
00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:11.940
I'm a researcher here at MIT and I'm a neuroscientist studying,

91
00:05:11.941 --> 00:05:14.490
learning and memory. That's what Matt Wilson does.

92
00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:18.900
It takes us to the dream. Last night when we first come in,

93
00:05:18.901 --> 00:05:23.280
what we see is this bank of monitors, 13 monitors all in a row,

94
00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:27.210
each monitor displaying ongoing activity in the brain, little panels,

95
00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:31.110
each panel, uh, showing these, it's like the Kennedy Space Center.

96
00:05:31.111 --> 00:05:34.440
Really all the monitors have data just flashing all over them.

97
00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:37.230
Graphs and squiggly lines and numbers.

98
00:05:37.290 --> 00:05:39.750
It's not immediately clear where all this information is coming from,

99
00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:41.520
but if you peek around the back,

100
00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:44.280
you'll see that all the computer wires go to one box,

101
00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:46.020
which then connects to a cable,

102
00:05:46.021 --> 00:05:51.021
which then goes up to the ceiling over to a wall and down into the head to the

103
00:05:51.031 --> 00:05:54.920
head generated of one sitting tiny red areas. Yes.

104
00:05:55.410 --> 00:05:58.520
It's just kind of hanging out in his little basket so you can just resting.

105
00:05:58.990 --> 00:06:00.720
Is that the Little Guy Himself? Yeah,

106
00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:05.600
he looks pretty normal except for this take cable coming out of his skull and

107
00:06:05.601 --> 00:06:08.330
the cable is basically a microphone or a bunch of them,

108
00:06:08.331 --> 00:06:12.800
which Matt uses to ease drop on the brain cells inside the rat's head as they

109
00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:15.230
chit chat and this is what that sounds like.

110
00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:16.673
<v 1>Okay.</v>

111
00:06:19.890 --> 00:06:22.200
<v 0>You can hear this kind of snap, crackle, pop sound.</v>

112
00:06:22.590 --> 00:06:24.960
These are individual cells that are firing.

113
00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:27.013
<v 1>Sure.</v>

114
00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:31.240
<v 0>There one of those kind of whooshing sound.</v>

115
00:06:31.990 --> 00:06:35.080
I can tell this animals sitting resting quietly.

116
00:06:36.530 --> 00:06:39.590
Amazingly. He says as well, he has his back to the animal.

117
00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:43.550
He is so fluent with the Morris Code language of the rat's brain sales.

118
00:06:43.551 --> 00:06:46.790
He doesn't even have to actually look at the animal to know what it's doing.

119
00:06:47.150 --> 00:06:49.700
You can just instantly decode all of that snapping,

120
00:06:50.620 --> 00:06:53.930
kind of like that guy in the matrix. That ball guy, I don't even see the code.

121
00:06:54.590 --> 00:06:58.220
All I see is bon Brunette redhead. Just by listening.

122
00:06:58.250 --> 00:07:01.430
Matt knows when the animal is sitting, he knows when it is sleeping.

123
00:07:01.431 --> 00:07:05.330
He knows when it's running around and amaze even can tell which direction it's

124
00:07:05.331 --> 00:07:09.800
running. That as we were studying these patterns while the animal ran around.

125
00:07:10.070 --> 00:07:12.650
After the experiments, the animals would, they would get tired.

126
00:07:12.651 --> 00:07:15.950
They would go to sleep. I would be there in the room,

127
00:07:16.280 --> 00:07:18.120
but I would continue to listen to the activity.

128
00:07:18.180 --> 00:07:19.630
You notice how it's gotten silent? Yeah.

129
00:07:20.030 --> 00:07:22.520
I begin to notice that when the animals were asleep,

130
00:07:22.700 --> 00:07:26.930
the brain cells weren't just firing randomly. In fact,

131
00:07:26.990 --> 00:07:28.550
when animals would go into rem sleep,

132
00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:29.400
<v 1>okay,</v>

133
00:07:29.400 --> 00:07:34.080
<v 0>now he isn't going into rem right now. The pattern of activity here,</v>

134
00:07:34.081 --> 00:07:38.370
notice if it's not these whooshes anymore sounded very much like the pattern

135
00:07:38.371 --> 00:07:40.140
that the animal had just been running through.

136
00:07:41.430 --> 00:07:43.470
If you weren't watching the animal, you would think, oh,

137
00:07:43.740 --> 00:07:45.840
animal has gotten up and is running around again.

138
00:07:45.841 --> 00:07:48.570
But then you turn and you look at, you see the animal is asleep.

139
00:07:48.790 --> 00:07:52.480
He checked the data and it wasn't simply that the rat was running around in its

140
00:07:52.481 --> 00:07:56.140
mind while his body was asleep. It seemed to be running a specific route,

141
00:07:56.530 --> 00:08:00.190
the same route in fact that it had run earlier in the day. Same sequence,

142
00:08:00.191 --> 00:08:04.600
same order, same everything. Yes, it was rerunning its maze,

143
00:08:05.350 --> 00:08:08.980
step for step. So then he asked the next question,

144
00:08:09.290 --> 00:08:11.980
are they seeing the things that they saw while they were awake?

145
00:08:12.310 --> 00:08:17.020
We can actually look into these questions as a rat. So the answers, the answers,

146
00:08:17.140 --> 00:08:20.590
we see evidence of replay and basically all of the parts of the brain that we

147
00:08:20.591 --> 00:08:24.490
have looked in, they see the maze that they ran through the very same maze. Yes.

148
00:08:24.600 --> 00:08:28.000
So that is dreaming in a sense. They are, how do we define dreaming?

149
00:08:28.210 --> 00:08:30.590
So sounds like dreaming to me. I don't know. I mean,

150
00:08:30.880 --> 00:08:35.230
but the question remains why would the rat or any creature do this?

151
00:08:35.350 --> 00:08:38.680
And so Matt came up with a simple next experiment.

152
00:08:38.681 --> 00:08:41.110
He decided to give the rat to mazes.

153
00:08:41.140 --> 00:08:43.900
What would that do to its dreams of the night or whatever you want to call them

154
00:08:44.100 --> 00:08:48.390
if they run on maze number one. And then on May as number two,

155
00:08:48.391 --> 00:08:52.650
we see them running maze one in maize two together in a way that they did not

156
00:08:52.651 --> 00:08:54.390
experience when they were awake.

157
00:08:55.020 --> 00:08:59.780
<v 2>Oh. So it's like a remix and new patterns alludes part of Phase One and part of</v>

158
00:08:59.920 --> 00:09:02.970
phase two. It turns out that when the Rad had more than one maze in its memory,

159
00:09:03.480 --> 00:09:06.450
it began to invent completely new mazes.

160
00:09:06.540 --> 00:09:08.790
Gives us the thought that

161
00:09:08.900 --> 00:09:13.280
<v 1>sleep is this unique opportunity to basically run through events,</v>

162
00:09:13.281 --> 00:09:18.281
to put them together in ways that may not have occurred while the animals were

163
00:09:19.311 --> 00:09:23.180
awake. And that's what learning really is.

164
00:09:23.181 --> 00:09:24.650
Learning is about synthesis,

165
00:09:24.651 --> 00:09:28.730
about taking things that were apparently unrelated and figuring out the

166
00:09:28.731 --> 00:09:32.060
connection that is figuring out the rules, the hidden rules,

167
00:09:32.061 --> 00:09:36.560
the undiscovered rules that will allow us to create something new.

168
00:09:36.620 --> 00:09:41.620
I think dreaming is a time when we try out possibilities that in waking we might

169
00:09:43.911 --> 00:09:47.480
not feel were worth trying and when it really works,

170
00:09:47.730 --> 00:09:51.920
it can be profoundly important if Robert's to gold is right.

171
00:09:52.400 --> 00:09:56.570
And how does this solving the problem thing, how does it work?

172
00:09:56.630 --> 00:10:01.190
How does the brain decide what to put into a dream and what to leave out of the

173
00:10:01.191 --> 00:10:01.720
dream?

174
00:10:01.720 --> 00:10:04.720
<v 2>One of the interesting things about dreams is that people don't have dreams</v>

175
00:10:04.721 --> 00:10:08.650
where their word processing, where they're surfing the net,

176
00:10:08.800 --> 00:10:13.090
these things that they spent huge amounts of their day doing don't get into

177
00:10:13.091 --> 00:10:16.870
their dreams, but somehow tetris gets in there every time we die.

178
00:10:17.110 --> 00:10:19.360
And why would that be? Well, he has a hunch,

179
00:10:19.390 --> 00:10:22.070
which he's actually exploring with a completely different video game.

180
00:10:22.090 --> 00:10:26.620
We've moved to a game called Alpine racer, which we bought out of a arcade.

181
00:10:26.710 --> 00:10:30.880
She showed us, took us down the hall to uh, to the game room.

182
00:10:31.030 --> 00:10:35.500
Here we are and they're in the corner. Each stood mockingly.

183
00:10:35.860 --> 00:10:40.050
Oh Wow. It's a full body game. Please step up. I stepped up to the game, right?

184
00:10:40.210 --> 00:10:43.150
It's trying to lock itself. It's still warming up.

185
00:10:43.270 --> 00:10:47.170
And then I set off down a virtual mountain.

186
00:10:49.830 --> 00:10:51.890
<v 5>Alright, I'm going down the hill. I'm also a girl.</v>

187
00:10:51.891 --> 00:10:55.010
I'm also avoiding the skis for what I'm doing. Take a nice little turn there.

188
00:10:55.011 --> 00:10:59.960
Be careful of the little wall straight down the head and down we go. Oh No, no.

189
00:11:00.090 --> 00:11:04.940
The tree [inaudible] we're not going to go through the tunnel.

190
00:11:04.941 --> 00:11:09.050
This is a wow. Oh, that hurt. As you can hear,

191
00:11:09.051 --> 00:11:12.770
this game was really stressful, I would say, which is by design.

192
00:11:12.860 --> 00:11:16.610
Robert stickle has the theory that as you go through your day,

193
00:11:16.640 --> 00:11:20.180
your brain is constantly keeping track of emotions. That's the thing.

194
00:11:20.230 --> 00:11:24.190
<v 1>Emotional content, like when you run into a virtual tree, for example,</v>

195
00:11:24.400 --> 00:11:28.270
your brain is going to flag that stuff. It's going to flag that is important.

196
00:11:28.300 --> 00:11:31.720
It says, Ooh, I need to remember this so I can work on it later.

197
00:11:31.780 --> 00:11:33.340
I'm going to put a sticky on this one,

198
00:11:33.341 --> 00:11:36.340
so if it puts a sticky on everything that's hard during the day,

199
00:11:36.640 --> 00:11:40.480
then all the brain has to do when it's creating a dream is go and grab sticks.

200
00:11:41.730 --> 00:11:44.750
<v 5>Oh, I didn't. I died, but I died. Nice. Okay.</v>

201
00:11:45.190 --> 00:11:48.820
<v 2>Okay. Just for the record, you've got further than jet on your first try.</v>

202
00:11:49.110 --> 00:11:53.900
Oh Wow. Wow. It's like the Tober.

203
00:11:55.060 --> 00:11:55.990
<v 0>Could you say that again?</v>

204
00:11:56.290 --> 00:12:00.460
So you have people play Alpine racer for 45 minute bursts throughout the day.

205
00:12:00.610 --> 00:12:03.340
What happens next? You wake them up, monitor their brain

206
00:12:03.880 --> 00:12:04.150
<v 2>activities,</v>

207
00:12:04.150 --> 00:12:07.820
and just as they're falling asleep within the first two minutes after they fall

208
00:12:07.821 --> 00:12:09.610
asleep, well, wake them up.

209
00:12:12.080 --> 00:12:16.690
There's a microphone right next to them in their bed and they just report what

210
00:12:16.691 --> 00:12:21.560
was going through their minds. I was just thinking about skiing,

211
00:12:21.770 --> 00:12:22.603
skiing.

212
00:12:22.990 --> 00:12:27.990
Can we get on the first night up to 40% of all the reports being about skiing

213
00:12:28.330 --> 00:12:32.430
and the game that I've been playing. Okay. Ski Racer, again,

214
00:12:32.980 --> 00:12:36.790
40% almost half of them. And that's right up there.

215
00:12:36.791 --> 00:12:40.660
What I would expect to see after trauma where something has been labeled so

216
00:12:40.740 --> 00:12:42.900
intensely that the brain says, okay,

217
00:12:42.901 --> 00:12:45.720
it's obvious what's on the agenda for tonight.

218
00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:50.210
<v 0>Steve Gold thinks he's seeing the outline of the dream making process here.</v>

219
00:12:50.211 --> 00:12:53.000
It starts really simply at the very beginning of sleep,

220
00:12:53.210 --> 00:12:55.790
like right after you fall asleep with the replay.

221
00:12:56.210 --> 00:13:00.350
This he suspects is just the brain emptying out at sticky things that really

222
00:13:00.351 --> 00:13:03.470
intrigued me during the day that they felt during the day. Yeah,

223
00:13:03.560 --> 00:13:04.550
but what happened?

224
00:13:04.590 --> 00:13:08.610
<v 2>And if we let the people go to sleep, sleep two hours,</v>

225
00:13:08.611 --> 00:13:11.760
like I didn't that very first time after climbing the mountain,

226
00:13:12.610 --> 00:13:14.490
wake them up after two hours of sleep.

227
00:13:14.710 --> 00:13:18.680
<v 0>Cause you remember he couldn't get Mack the memory of the rocks after he'd spent</v>

228
00:13:18.681 --> 00:13:19.910
two hours of sleep. That's right.

229
00:13:19.911 --> 00:13:23.330
And what he's found is that if you fast forward two hours into the dream,

230
00:13:23.331 --> 00:13:25.610
get almost no reports of skiing at all,

231
00:13:25.670 --> 00:13:29.660
the replay seems to dissolve into a remix.

232
00:13:29.661 --> 00:13:31.070
We start getting reports like

233
00:13:32.240 --> 00:13:36.690
<v 2>alright, jumped. I was sliding down a hill going down hill,</v>

234
00:13:36.750 --> 00:13:40.710
just rolling down a hill on mark about,

235
00:13:41.160 --> 00:13:43.800
it was about this head down hell banana.

236
00:13:44.730 --> 00:13:46.830
I was thinking about skateboarding.

237
00:13:47.130 --> 00:13:51.420
I was thinking about about a bunch of bananas doing, you're the honest caseload.

238
00:13:51.540 --> 00:13:56.350
Someone else had a dream that they were rushing through a forest with their

239
00:13:56.410 --> 00:14:01.060
body, incredibly stiff and their leg is not moving at all as if they were on a

240
00:14:01.061 --> 00:14:01.894
conveyor belt.

241
00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:05.690
<v 0>It's like as the dream goes on, the brain is starting to free associate.</v>

242
00:14:06.290 --> 00:14:09.530
What do I have in my past that has anything to do with mountains,

243
00:14:09.800 --> 00:14:13.640
anything to do with crashing or skiing, anything at all that can help me.

244
00:14:13.670 --> 00:14:16.010
What do I have in all my memories,

245
00:14:16.460 --> 00:14:21.460
my case from the last 60 years that fits associatively thematically and the

246
00:14:22.521 --> 00:14:26.930
result, well might seem random. It is, but every so often he says,

247
00:14:27.080 --> 00:14:28.370
you come up with the right answer.

248
00:14:28.400 --> 00:14:32.840
So now we get to your dreams of people discovering the structure of benzene.

249
00:14:33.920 --> 00:14:38.410
Cuckold was his name. [inaudible] actually August calculus.

250
00:14:38.450 --> 00:14:40.550
He was a German guy who talked about earlier,

251
00:14:40.551 --> 00:14:44.600
who had a dream of a snake eating its tail and realized from that dream that the

252
00:14:44.900 --> 00:14:49.280
shape of the Benzie molecule is a ring. I don't know if that dream is true,

253
00:14:49.640 --> 00:14:52.490
but maybe that is in fact the point of dreaming.

254
00:14:53.090 --> 00:14:56.150
It's this time when you shut off the outside, turn inside,

255
00:14:56.450 --> 00:14:59.750
take the problems that you've got and start to really work on them,

256
00:14:59.751 --> 00:15:00.590
pull them apart,

257
00:15:00.920 --> 00:15:05.350
make connections that you wouldn't normally make during the day all.

258
00:15:05.390 --> 00:15:06.223
However,

259
00:15:06.770 --> 00:15:10.790
have you ever wondered why it would be necessary when solving problems like this

260
00:15:10.791 --> 00:15:12.020
to dream so vividly?

261
00:15:12.530 --> 00:15:16.880
Are you at all puzzled by the super duper technicolor,

262
00:15:17.210 --> 00:15:20.390
extraordinarily cinematic quality of some of these things?

263
00:15:20.391 --> 00:15:25.160
Because if it were just an everyday brain function to sort of make sense of the

264
00:15:25.161 --> 00:15:26.810
world and allow you to make new connections,

265
00:15:26.811 --> 00:15:31.480
you really wouldn't need quite the the movie quality.

266
00:15:31.490 --> 00:15:33.110
So when we talk about

267
00:15:33.490 --> 00:15:38.200
<v 2>dreams, what seems to come into dreams are memories,</v>

268
00:15:38.230 --> 00:15:40.030
concepts, relationships,

269
00:15:40.150 --> 00:15:45.150
associations that have a strong emotional flavor and I'm guessing from the data

270
00:15:47.110 --> 00:15:52.110
need a full blown orchestration to be properly processed and it is its technical

271
00:15:53.380 --> 00:15:55.420
or the colors are overwhelming.

272
00:15:55.790 --> 00:15:56.630
<v 0>So if I hear you right,</v>

273
00:15:56.631 --> 00:15:59.810
what you're saying in Robert's question about why are the dreams so, uh,

274
00:16:00.110 --> 00:16:02.540
vivid is that, I don't know,

275
00:16:02.541 --> 00:16:06.740
but maybe the vividness helps. Okay. Hold long answers.

276
00:16:06.741 --> 00:16:09.500
What a Harvard professor says instead of saying, I don't know.

277
00:16:14.270 --> 00:16:17.210
I guess we should wrap up if you want any more information on anything that you

278
00:16:17.211 --> 00:16:18.710
heard at this hour, visit our website,

279
00:16:19.940 --> 00:16:22.500
radiolab.org you see there'll be more information about sleep on there.

280
00:16:22.600 --> 00:16:23.061
It will there. Yes,

281
00:16:23.061 --> 00:16:26.630
there will be more information on sleep and you can sign up for our podcast

282
00:16:26.990 --> 00:16:28.490
radio lab.org also,

283
00:16:28.491 --> 00:16:33.491
while you had to send us an email radio lab@wnyc.org is the address.

284
00:16:33.920 --> 00:16:36.230
Remember also that sleep spelled backwards is pills,

285
00:16:36.650 --> 00:16:39.950
which is what you do to an orange grapefruit and full pair of jet.

286
00:16:40.090 --> 00:16:42.440
I've been Rod, I remember college. We'll see you later.
