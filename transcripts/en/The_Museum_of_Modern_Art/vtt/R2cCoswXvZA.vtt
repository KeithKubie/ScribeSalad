00:00:08.405 --> 00:00:09.980
When you buy a tube of paint,

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:13.483
what's in that tube primarily
is pigment and binder.

00:00:13.483 --> 00:00:14.840
Pigment is the color matter.

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:16.954
It's the stuff that
provides paint with color.

00:00:16.954 --> 00:00:19.222
Now, these can be finely
ground up minerals.

00:00:19.222 --> 00:00:21.424
They can be natural products as well.

00:00:21.424 --> 00:00:24.996
The binder is essentially the glue,

00:00:24.996 --> 00:00:26.230
the adhesive of the paint,

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:29.499
the stuff that sticks all those
little flecks of color together.

00:00:29.499 --> 00:00:32.423
The binder of oil paint is linseed oil,

00:00:32.423 --> 00:00:34.205
literally the oil from flax seeds.

00:00:34.205 --> 00:00:36.373
So essentially we have the pigment,

00:00:36.373 --> 00:00:38.445
the color matter going into the binder

00:00:38.445 --> 00:00:39.977
which holds it all together

00:00:39.977 --> 00:00:43.853
and then this is mostly what paint is.

00:00:43.853 --> 00:00:46.483
Using a glass muller, I'm
ensuring that the pigment evenly

00:00:46.483 --> 00:00:48.919
is dispersed into that oil,
as I'm really making sure

00:00:48.919 --> 00:00:50.889
this paint has a uniform consistency.

00:00:50.889 --> 00:00:52.506
If you buy a tube of paint today,

00:00:52.506 --> 00:00:55.339
this stuff is done by
huge industrial processes

00:00:55.339 --> 00:00:57.561
rather than the old-fashioned handmade

00:00:57.561 --> 00:00:59.878
way that I'm demonstrating here.

00:00:59.878 --> 00:01:01.800
Now the more oil that
is added to the paint,

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:04.256
the more translucent that paint becomes.

00:01:04.256 --> 00:01:05.802
Because this oil is barely colored,

00:01:05.802 --> 00:01:08.293
it has a slight yellow cast to it,

00:01:08.293 --> 00:01:09.924
the more of that we add, the further

00:01:09.924 --> 00:01:11.839
we push apart those
little flecks of color,

00:01:11.839 --> 00:01:13.312
those little bits of pigment.

00:01:13.312 --> 00:01:16.174
If they're spread apart
into what's called the glaze

00:01:16.174 --> 00:01:17.814
with a lot of linseed oil, then we can see

00:01:17.814 --> 00:01:19.116
through that paint.

00:01:19.116 --> 00:01:24.655
I'm making it translucent.
