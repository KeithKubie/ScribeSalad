Fernando I think you are doing something
 

00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:14.420
Fernando I think you are doing something
that has been a real passionate part of

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:14.430
that has been a real passionate part of
 

00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:15.890
that has been a real passionate part of
my life and that is that you're

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:15.900
my life and that is that you're
 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:18.650
my life and that is that you're
combining science and art and I think it

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:18.660
combining science and art and I think it
 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:20.300
combining science and art and I think it
was a mistake in our culture to ever

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310

Mythology around that people often talk

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570
Mythology around that people often talk
 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:26.510
Mythology around that people often talk
about for example right brain versus

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:26.520
about for example right brain versus
 

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:28.790
about for example right brain versus
left brain and a lot of people don't

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800
left brain and a lot of people don't
 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.170
left brain and a lot of people don't
realize that there's really no

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:30.180
realize that there's really no
 

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:32.450
realize that there's really no
scientific evidence of that at all it's

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460
scientific evidence of that at all it's
 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:34.700
scientific evidence of that at all it's
more of an analogy than anything else

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710
more of an analogy than anything else
 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:36.529

there isn't one part of your brain

00:00:36.529 --> 00:00:36.539
there isn't one part of your brain
 

00:00:36.539 --> 00:00:38.209
there isn't one part of your brain
that's logical and scientific and

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219
that's logical and scientific and
 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:40.220

that can be done through art as is done
 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:50.360
that can be done through art as is done
through science I think there are

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370
through science I think there are
 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:52.819
through science I think there are
different ways of humans exploring and

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829
different ways of humans exploring and
 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:54.590

time it's very simple you walk into the
 

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:11.479
time it's very simple you walk into the
Jet Propulsion Laboratory and there's a

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:11.489
Jet Propulsion Laboratory and there's a
 

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:13.369

we are uploading instructions to our
 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:25.380
we are uploading instructions to our
spacecraft in space and when we are

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:25.390
spacecraft in space and when we are
 

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:27.600
spacecraft in space and when we are
downloading the data and you actually

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:27.610
downloading the data and you actually
 

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:30.000
downloading the data and you actually
see that as lights little lights and the

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:30.010
see that as lights little lights and the
 

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:32.010
see that as lights little lights and the
LEDs and the columns moving up towards

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:32.020
LEDs and the columns moving up towards
 

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:34.020
LEDs and the columns moving up towards
space in a beautiful pattern and then

space in a beautiful pattern and then
 

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:35.700
space in a beautiful pattern and then
when we're downloading data say from a

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:35.710
when we're downloading data say from a
 

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:37.440
when we're downloading data say from a

spacecraft around Jupiter when we're
 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:39.120
spacecraft around Jupiter when we're
receiving it you see the lights coming

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:39.130
receiving it you see the lights coming
 

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:41.010
receiving it you see the lights coming
down as new information comes down from

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:41.020
down as new information comes down from
 

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:43.680
down as new information comes down from
space and as you walk around during your

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:43.690
space and as you walk around during your
 

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:47.190
space and as you walk around during your
day at JPL you see the pulse of

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:47.200
day at JPL you see the pulse of
 

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:49.170
day at JPL you see the pulse of
discovery right in front of you and it's

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:49.180
discovery right in front of you and it's
 

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:51.090
discovery right in front of you and it's
real it's actually linked to the

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:51.100
real it's actually linked to the
 

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:52.770
real it's actually linked to the
commands coming to and from the

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:52.780
commands coming to and from the
 

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:55.350
commands coming to and from the
spacecraft so it makes you pause and

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:55.360
spacecraft so it makes you pause and
 

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:56.880
spacecraft so it makes you pause and
think about what you're doing and and

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:56.890
think about what you're doing and and
 

00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:00.390
think about what you're doing and and
this is to me the real core of art to

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:00.400
this is to me the real core of art to
 

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:02.550
this is to me the real core of art to
make you stop question the reality

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:02.560
make you stop question the reality
 

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:04.830
make you stop question the reality
around you think about what's really

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:04.840
around you think about what's really
 

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:06.210
around you think about what's really
going on how you could view it

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:06.220
going on how you could view it
 

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:09.570
going on how you could view it
differently so many organizations take

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:09.580
differently so many organizations take
 

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:11.550
differently so many organizations take
this very seriously there are workshops

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:11.560
this very seriously there are workshops
 

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:13.050
this very seriously there are workshops
there are conferences on the

there are conferences on the
 

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:14.940
there are conferences on the
intersection of art and science there's

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:14.950
intersection of art and science there's
 

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:16.530

whole people learn science differently

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:37.090
whole people learn science differently
 

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:39.780
whole people learn science differently
people's minds work differently art can

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:39.790
people's minds work differently art can
 

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:42.480
people's minds work differently art can
help people learn science so there is

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:42.490
help people learn science so there is
 

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:44.340
help people learn science so there is
really this wonderful synergy that can

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:44.350
really this wonderful synergy that can
 

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:46.920
really this wonderful synergy that can
exist between art and science so there

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:46.930
exist between art and science so there
 

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:48.810
exist between art and science so there
isn't a single institution I can point

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:48.820
isn't a single institution I can point
 

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:50.460
isn't a single institution I can point
you to in terms of you know these people

specialize in that but know that there

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:53.020
specialize in that but know that there

really is a very serious inclusion of

00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:56.140
really is a very serious inclusion of
 

00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:58.080
really is a very serious inclusion of
art in the science that's going on right

00:03:58.080 --> 00:03:58.090
art in the science that's going on right
 

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:00.510
art in the science that's going on right
now and that needs to continue I think

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:00.520
now and that needs to continue I think
 

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:02.460
now and that needs to continue I think
even for the survival of science we have

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:02.470
even for the survival of science we have
 

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:03.990
even for the survival of science we have
to make something relevant to our

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:04.000
to make something relevant to our
 

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.570
to make something relevant to our
culture and relevant to people and an

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:06.580
culture and relevant to people and an
 

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:09.760
culture and relevant to people and an
art is going to help us do that

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:09.770
art is going to help us do that
 

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:13.009
art is going to help us do that
