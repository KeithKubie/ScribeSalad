00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:02.250
Here's how I figured out the answer.

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:05.590
I started with this node here,
and I noticed that there

00:00:05.590 --> 00:00:10.980
were 3 plus 1 units coming in, so
there must be 4 units going out.

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:14.960
Looking at this node down here, I
observe that 10 units are coming in, so

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:16.230
10 units need to come out.

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:22.220
There are two unknown flows going out,
but the capacities are 6 and

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:25.930
4, respectively, for
a total of 10 capacity.

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:28.030
This means that there's no ambiguity.

00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:30.900
Both edges must be used
to their full capacity.

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:33.400
That is to say, that they are saturated.

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:35.690
Finally that leaves me with this edge.

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:40.228
We have 4 plus 6 coming in,
and 2 units going out already,

00:00:40.228 --> 00:00:45.240
meaning that 8 more units must
go out flowing along this edge.

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:49.128
And I can check my work at the end by
confirming that the amount coming out of

00:00:49.128 --> 00:00:49.818
the source,

00:00:49.818 --> 00:00:54.470
12 units in this case, is the same
amount that's going into the sink.

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.970
Perfect.
