00:00:00.405 --> 00:00:01.370
- [Voiceover] Hello, grammarians.

00:00:01.370 --> 00:00:02.203
Hello Rosie.

00:00:02.203 --> 00:00:03.036
- [Voiceover] Hello, David.

00:00:03.036 --> 00:00:05.705
- [Voiceover] So, okay, you
know the Schoolhouse Rock song

00:00:05.705 --> 00:00:07.071
Conjunction Junction?

00:00:07.071 --> 00:00:07.904
- [Voiceover] Right.

00:00:07.904 --> 00:00:08.737
- [Voiceover] Classic.

00:00:08.737 --> 00:00:09.570
- [Voiceover] Classic.

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:11.592
- [Voiceover] So in that song, you know,

00:00:11.592 --> 00:00:14.015
the chorus asks, like,

00:00:14.015 --> 00:00:15.947
♫ Conjunction junction,
what's your function ♫

00:00:15.947 --> 00:00:17.959
And then the engineer
played by Jack Sheldon goes,

00:00:17.959 --> 00:00:20.809
♫ Hooking up words and
phrases and clauses ♫

00:00:20.809 --> 00:00:23.300
And so that's what we're
gonna be talking about today

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:25.844
is the difference between
a phrase and a clause,

00:00:25.844 --> 00:00:28.093
because both of them are
groups of words, right?

00:00:28.093 --> 00:00:29.841
Phrases and clauses are
both groups of words

00:00:29.841 --> 00:00:32.667
but they each do different things.

00:00:32.667 --> 00:00:34.476
So let's break that down.

00:00:34.476 --> 00:00:39.038
So, Rosie, if you'd
please, what is a phrase?

00:00:39.038 --> 00:00:41.580
- [Voiceover] So phrase
is a group of words

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:44.062
and it acts like a single part of speech,

00:00:44.062 --> 00:00:47.979
but it's not, it will
never be a full sentence,

00:00:49.148 --> 00:00:53.315
because phrases don't have
both a subject and a verb.

00:00:54.678 --> 00:00:57.693
- [Voiceover] Right, so a
phrase can never be a sentence.

00:00:57.693 --> 00:00:58.526
- [Voiceover] Right.

00:00:58.526 --> 00:01:01.932
- [Voiceover] What are
some examples of phrases?

00:01:01.932 --> 00:01:03.756
- [Voiceover] My best friend.

00:01:03.756 --> 00:01:05.168
- [Voiceover] So this is a group of words

00:01:05.168 --> 00:01:07.127
that ultimately behaves like a noun?

00:01:07.127 --> 00:01:07.960
- [Voiceover] Right.

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:09.469
- [Voiceover] Okay.

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:11.260
- [Voiceover] Then there's
an adjective phrase,

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:13.020
with the blue shirt.

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:15.115
- [Voiceover] So this is
a prepositional phrase

00:01:15.115 --> 00:01:17.688
that, as you said, is
behaving like an adjective.

00:01:17.688 --> 00:01:18.521
- [Voiceover] Right.

00:01:18.521 --> 00:01:19.354
- [Voiceover] Okay.

00:01:19.354 --> 00:01:21.849
- [Voiceover] And then for 20 days,

00:01:21.849 --> 00:01:23.451
which behaves like an adverb.

00:01:23.451 --> 00:01:24.801
- [Voiceover] So this is a noun phrase,

00:01:24.801 --> 00:01:27.974
an adjective phrase and
an adverbial phrase.

00:01:27.974 --> 00:01:30.188
So none of these things can be sentences,

00:01:30.188 --> 00:01:33.705
but they all, like you said,
act like parts of speech.

00:01:33.705 --> 00:01:36.945
Okay, meanwhile a clause
is a group of words

00:01:36.945 --> 00:01:38.455
that can be a sentence?

00:01:38.455 --> 00:01:40.021
- [Voiceover] It's not always a sentence,

00:01:40.021 --> 00:01:44.188
but the big difference
between phrases and clauses is

00:01:45.211 --> 00:01:49.478
that clauses do have both
a subject and a verb.

00:01:49.478 --> 00:01:51.197
- [Voiceover] So it's
not, it can't be a phrase

00:01:51.197 --> 00:01:53.444
because a phrase is
just one part of speech,

00:01:53.444 --> 00:01:56.518
but a clause always has a
noun or pronoun component

00:01:56.518 --> 00:01:58.118
and a verb component.

00:01:58.118 --> 00:01:58.951
- [Voiceover] That's right.

00:01:58.951 --> 00:02:00.484
- [Voiceover] Okay.

00:02:00.484 --> 00:02:04.586
- [Voiceover] So, a clause
could be a dependent clause

00:02:04.586 --> 00:02:06.986
which can't stand on its own.

00:02:06.986 --> 00:02:11.038
For example, the wizard who cast spell.

00:02:11.038 --> 00:02:14.198
Right, that can't be its own sentence,

00:02:14.198 --> 00:02:16.531
but it's got a lot going on.

00:02:17.403 --> 00:02:18.950
- [Voiceover] So that's not a sentence,

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:21.259
but it can also be independent.

00:02:21.259 --> 00:02:23.647
- [Voiceover] Right, so, if we said,

00:02:23.647 --> 00:02:27.647
"The wizard cast a spell,"
that's also a clause,

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:32.416
and it's also its own sentence.

00:02:32.416 --> 00:02:34.552
- [Voiceover] So let's
test a couple of things

00:02:34.552 --> 00:02:37.802
and see if they are phrases or clauses.

00:02:38.745 --> 00:02:39.578
- [Voiceover] Okay.

00:02:39.578 --> 00:02:41.981
- [Voiceover] The falcon
soared majestically.

00:02:41.981 --> 00:02:44.739
So this is a group of words.

00:02:44.739 --> 00:02:48.906
And we've got the falcon
here, that's a noun phrase,

00:02:50.571 --> 00:02:54.472
that's behaving like a part of speech.

00:02:54.472 --> 00:02:58.070
So I know that this
definitely has a phrase in it,

00:02:58.070 --> 00:03:00.321
but is it just a phrase on its own?

00:03:00.321 --> 00:03:03.052
I guess I would have to say
no, because it's got this verb,

00:03:03.052 --> 00:03:06.309
soared, and this adverb, majectically.

00:03:06.309 --> 00:03:08.215
So, the falcon soared majestically,

00:03:08.215 --> 00:03:10.194
I would have to say this is a clause.

00:03:10.194 --> 00:03:11.158
Would I be right?

00:03:11.158 --> 00:03:12.037
- [Voiceover] You would be right.

00:03:12.037 --> 00:03:13.787
- [Voiceover] Hooray!

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:16.230
- [Voiceover] That's not only a clause,

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:18.646
but it's an independent clause.

00:03:18.646 --> 00:03:21.651
- [Voiceover] So it can
be its own sentence.

00:03:21.651 --> 00:03:23.929
With a period right.

00:03:23.929 --> 00:03:25.821
So let's get a little bit of
a George Harrison in here.

00:03:25.821 --> 00:03:28.125
While my guitar gently weeps.

00:03:28.125 --> 00:03:31.081
So we've got a subject in here, my guitar,

00:03:31.081 --> 00:03:32.858
and a verb, weeps.

00:03:32.858 --> 00:03:34.427
So we know it's a clause,

00:03:34.427 --> 00:03:37.301
but it begins with this word while,

00:03:37.301 --> 00:03:39.570
which is, I think, a
subordinating conjunction.

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:40.403
- [Voiceover] Right.

00:03:40.403 --> 00:03:42.030
- [Voiceover] So this would be
actually a dependent clause,

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:44.048
but it is a clause, so
this thing could not be

00:03:44.048 --> 00:03:46.558
a sentence on it's own.

00:03:46.558 --> 00:03:48.850
- [Voiceover] That's right.

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:50.087
- [Voiceover] Now Rosie, what about

00:03:50.087 --> 00:03:52.303
the best ham sandwich in Oklahoma?

00:03:52.303 --> 00:03:54.720
Is that a phrase or a clause?

00:03:55.738 --> 00:03:56.976
- [Voiceover] That is a phrase.

00:03:56.976 --> 00:03:59.113
- [Voiceover] Okay, why is that?

00:03:59.113 --> 00:04:01.275
- [Voiceover] We don't have a verb.

00:04:01.275 --> 00:04:03.108
This is all a subject,

00:04:05.293 --> 00:04:08.647
and we've got the best,
so we've kind of got

00:04:08.647 --> 00:04:11.761
this superlative thrown in there.

00:04:11.761 --> 00:04:14.593
- [Voiceover] But it's all
modifying ham sandwich.

00:04:14.593 --> 00:04:15.426
- [Voiceover] Right.

00:04:15.426 --> 00:04:16.758
- [Voiceover] It's actually
all modifying sandwich,

00:04:16.758 --> 00:04:19.130
'cause it's the best ham sandwich.

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:20.844
And then we've got this
other prepositional phrase

00:04:20.844 --> 00:04:22.964
that also modifies sandwich.

00:04:22.964 --> 00:04:23.797
- [Voiceover] Right.

00:04:23.797 --> 00:04:26.217
- [Voiceover] So that's a phrase.

00:04:26.217 --> 00:04:29.139
How about under the ocean blue?

00:04:29.139 --> 00:04:30.328
- [Voiceover] That is a phrase.

00:04:30.328 --> 00:04:32.583
- [Voiceover] Okay.

00:04:32.583 --> 00:04:34.472
What makes you say that?

00:04:34.472 --> 00:04:38.472
- [Voiceover] Well, again,
we don't have a verb,

00:04:39.984 --> 00:04:42.817
so we've got a subject, the ocean,

00:04:43.802 --> 00:04:45.992
and we have under, that's a preposition,

00:04:45.992 --> 00:04:49.991
so we have kind of a
direction and a subject,

00:04:49.991 --> 00:04:51.441
we have a direction and a place,

00:04:51.441 --> 00:04:53.944
but we don't have an action.

00:04:53.944 --> 00:04:54.995
- [Voiceover] And that would make it

00:04:54.995 --> 00:04:57.190
a phrase and not a clause.

00:04:57.190 --> 00:04:59.329
So, phrases are groups of words

00:04:59.329 --> 00:05:00.895
that act like parts of speech,

00:05:00.895 --> 00:05:03.310
so this one, for example,

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:07.221
is an adjectival or adverbial phrase.

00:05:07.221 --> 00:05:10.916
We don't know because, we
don't know what it's modifying.

00:05:10.916 --> 00:05:12.963
And this one is a noun phrase,

00:05:12.963 --> 00:05:14.971
the best ham sandwich in Oklahoma.

00:05:14.971 --> 00:05:16.874
It's behaving like a noun.

00:05:16.874 --> 00:05:19.624
And clauses are groups of phrases

00:05:20.596 --> 00:05:22.530
that have a subject and a verb.

00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:25.910
So, while my guitar gently weeps.

00:05:25.910 --> 00:05:27.339
There's a guitar, what is it doing?

00:05:27.339 --> 00:05:30.467
It's weeping, so we know it's a clause.

00:05:30.467 --> 00:05:31.566
We'll go into what the difference

00:05:31.566 --> 00:05:34.391
between a dependent and an
independent clause is next time,

00:05:34.391 --> 00:05:36.893
but just know for now,
this is a clause over here

00:05:36.893 --> 00:05:40.843
and this clause over here, the
falcon soared majestically,

00:05:40.843 --> 00:05:42.924
is also a clause by dint of the fact

00:05:42.924 --> 00:05:45.302
that it has both a subject, the falcon,

00:05:45.302 --> 00:05:48.657
and a verb, soared majestically.

00:05:48.657 --> 00:05:49.490
- [Voiceover] All right.

00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:50.408
- [Voiceover] Cool.

00:05:50.408 --> 00:05:53.162
That is phrases and clauses.

00:05:53.162 --> 00:05:55.258
You can learn anything, David out.

00:05:55.258 --> 00:05:56.190
- [Voiceover] Rosie out.
