00:00:00.670 --> 00:00:04.610
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, D.C.

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:24.500
&gt;&gt; David Plylar: Good
evening, everybody.

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:26.320
My name is David Plylar.

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:29.010
I'm in the music division
at the Library of Congress.

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:30.810
And I'm really pleased
- I don't know if any

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:32.110
of you were here last night

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:35.050
to hear the Dover Quartet
play [applause] - yeah.

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:36.350
Some fans already here.

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:38.580
It was a fantastic
performance last night.

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:40.350
And we get the rare
treat of getting

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:45.360
to hear the same music
performed again this evening.

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:49.110
Thanks. Yeah.

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:52.870
And so I'm very pleased to
have with me two members

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:57.100
of the Dover Quartet, Milena
Pajaro-Van de Stadt --

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:01.610
I knew I'd butcher it and so
I apologize - and Camden Shaw,

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:06.870
both on the lower
spectrum of the quartet

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:08.490
in terms of violoncello.

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:09.990
&gt;&gt; Milena Pajaro-Van de Stadt:
We're the grounded ones.

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:11.290
&gt;&gt; David Plylar: The
grounded ones, yeah [laugher].

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:17.640
And so we actually have a
lot that we can talk about.

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.970
The program that they're
doing is just fantastic,

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:22.310
and it's a very interesting one.

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:25.720
And maybe we could just
hit some of that material.

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:27.300
We'll go in order and
then talk about some

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:29.420
of your other projects
and things like that.

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:32.540
So maybe - I don't
know how many people

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:33.840
in the audience are familiar

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.400
with the music of
Viktor Ullmann.

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:38.070
Is it - a few, just a few.

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:41.770
But it's not a - not a kind of
a common - commonly-heard name.

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:45.300
So maybe you could say a bit
about how you came to learn

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:48.290
of this composer and to
pick this particular piece,

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:49.980
that kind of a thing.

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:51.280
&gt;&gt; Milena Pajaro-Van de
Stadt: Well, we hadn't -

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:56.280
we hadn't really heard about
him much, if at all, until -

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:58.740
was it three or four
years ago maybe,

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:02.480
a presenter out in
Santa Fe, Marc Neikrug,

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:06.200
who has us over at
his summer festival,

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:08.880
said to us that there
was this list of quartets

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:11.760
that were very dear to him
that people never performed.

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:13.060
And he sent them to us and said,

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:14.360
would you consider
playing one of them?

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:15.750
We started listening to them,

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:17.860
and we came across
Viktor Ullmann Quartet No.

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:21.490
3 and listened to it and
just loved it immediately.

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:23.900
So we -- we told him that's
the one we want to play.

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:26.320
So we started touring with it.

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:29.550
We learned about who he was.

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:31.510
He was a victim of Auschwitz.

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:35.190
And the piece he actually
wrote while he was interned

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:39.220
at Theresienstadt,
the propaganda camp.

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:42.580
And his - I think a dear
friend of his convinced him

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:47.210
to leave behind all his work
when he was being deported;

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:49.630
the day he was being
deported to Auschwitz.

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:53.680
And what remained of the
music were photographs

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:55.560
of what he had written on scraps

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:57.620
of whatever they
had in the camp.

00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:59.630
And eventually people
took those photographs

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:02.410
and printed out the
actual parts.

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:06.130
And it's really a
fantastically powerful piece

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:10.420
and surprisingly
uplifting and triumphant.

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:13.300
&gt;&gt; David Plylar:
The - you mentioned

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:17.480
that Theresienstadt was kind
of a propaganda type of place.

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:21.220
I know that he was - he was able
to write quite a bit of music.

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:23.480
Actually, it was a surprising
amount, to me, of music.

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:25.050
But he was also active
as a critic

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:26.980
and other types of
things in this.

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:31.030
Do you feel that this - when
you approach - I should say,

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:34.380
when you approach the music,
does that come into play at all?

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:36.380
Or do you look at it
a bit more abstractly?

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:39.240
Or how do you deal with
that kind of baggage that -

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:41.710
that a work like that has?

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:43.010
&gt;&gt; Camden Shaw: That's a
- that's a great question.

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:47.030
I think with music this great,
as it really is, you could -

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:48.550
it works well in either context.

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:51.830
You can certainly see it in
that context of being in the war

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:53.800
and that he was at the
camp when he wrote it.

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:57.640
And that does give it a
certain extra power for sure.

00:03:57.640 --> 00:03:59.750
But it's so great that
even not knowing that,

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:01.050
one would love the work.

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:02.350
And it is - as Milena said,

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:04.680
it's a really triumphant
and strong piece.

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:07.120
There was this curious thing
happening at Theresienstadt

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:10.010
where there was almost
the illusion of security

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:12.730
because it was the
only concentration camp

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:15.110
where the inmates didn't
have to shave their heads.

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:16.490
They could keep their hair.

00:04:16.490 --> 00:04:18.760
There were a lot of artists
which were encouraged

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:20.510
at the time to produce some art.

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:22.770
And now there - there
are entire exhibitions

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:25.060
of only art from Theresienstadt.

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:29.680
So in a way it probably felt a
little bit safer than a place

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:31.410
like Auschwitz, but
it really wasn't.

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:32.710
And - and there was the day

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:34.890
where they shipped
everyone pretty much

00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:36.890
from Theresienstadt
over to Auschwitz.

00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:38.190
&gt;&gt; Milena Pajaro-Van de
Stadt: There's actually -

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:42.560
there's something about the
piece that - that makes me feel

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:46.140
in a certain way he was able
to escape his surroundings.

00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:50.440
And for me, in a strange way
it's the moment where he -

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:53.630
he starts this fugue at the
end of the first part --

00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:56.330
it's really in two big chunks -

00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:58.560
when he starts this
fugue in the viola.

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:00.450
And it's - it's incredibly
beautiful.

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:04.820
We didn't realize for awhile,
but it's a twelve-tone subject

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:07.230
which is an interesting
connection to the Schoenberg

00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:09.640
which is also in the program,
which is not twelve-tone.

00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:11.350
But - but, you know -

00:05:11.350 --> 00:05:12.760
&gt;&gt; David Plylar: She says,
don't run away [laughter].

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:14.890
&gt;&gt; Milena Pajaro-Van
de Stadt: But the -

00:05:14.890 --> 00:05:20.490
the fact that he was able to -
to put his mind into something

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:22.950
like that, writing this
twelve-tone subject,

00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:26.440
put harmonizing in
absolutely tonally

00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:29.560
in the most beautiful way
that kind of masks the fact

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:31.360
that it was twelve-tone,

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:35.030
he was not only incredibly
emotional throughout the work

00:05:35.030 --> 00:05:36.670
but also incredibly
intellectual.

00:05:36.670 --> 00:05:39.930
And I feel like that was a
really - that was one way

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:44.160
for him to kind of turn off
what was going on around him.

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:45.460
&gt;&gt; Camden Shaw: Definitely.

00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:48.130
And speaking more to - to
his lineage with composition,

00:05:48.130 --> 00:05:50.640
he actually studied with
both Zemlinsky a little bit

00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:51.940
and Schoenberg.

00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:53.640
So there's a direct
connection with Ullmann

00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:55.360
and those two - two men.

00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:58.320
And it is really
amazing how [inaudible]

00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:01.470
to combine different ideas
that were going on at the time.

00:06:01.470 --> 00:06:04.720
So he was able to write kind
of with twelve-tone inspiration

00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:07.660
but then, as she said,
harmonize it completely tonally

00:06:07.660 --> 00:06:09.400
which was something that
was not done very often,

00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:11.850
to sort of synthesize
these different ideas.

00:06:11.850 --> 00:06:14.030
And the beginning of
the piece almost sounds

00:06:14.030 --> 00:06:15.530
like Debussy or Ravel.

00:06:15.530 --> 00:06:17.540
It's really focused
on atmosphere

00:06:17.540 --> 00:06:19.240
and texture and color.

00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:21.650
And there really - we
can't think of anyone else

00:06:21.650 --> 00:06:23.950
that wrote really how he did.

00:06:23.950 --> 00:06:26.230
It's also interesting
in the opening subject

00:06:26.230 --> 00:06:29.800
of the last movement it uses
eleven out of the twelve tones.

00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:32.310
So he's not attempting to -
it's not as if he was trying

00:06:32.310 --> 00:06:33.820
to be twelve-tone
and came one short.

00:06:33.820 --> 00:06:36.380
But his language was
just so close to that.

00:06:36.380 --> 00:06:39.460
But he clearly was not
concerned with the rules

00:06:39.460 --> 00:06:41.210
of twelve-tone writing which -

00:06:41.210 --> 00:06:43.170
which could in a
way become a crutch

00:06:43.170 --> 00:06:45.930
for some composers,
one could argue.

00:06:45.930 --> 00:06:49.500
So it's interesting that he
was very open to these concepts

00:06:49.500 --> 00:06:52.600
but was certainly not - not
imprisoned by them as ideas.

00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:53.900
&gt;&gt; David Plylar: Yeah.

00:06:53.900 --> 00:06:55.200
I would say, though, that
there's definitely a sense

00:06:55.200 --> 00:06:57.220
of kind of - it seems
highly structured to me,

00:06:57.220 --> 00:06:59.170
the way that he puts
things together.

00:06:59.170 --> 00:07:02.970
And - and maybe there's more of
a kind of a harmonic affiliation

00:07:02.970 --> 00:07:05.640
with Berg or someone like
that in bringing out some

00:07:05.640 --> 00:07:08.070
of that romantic lineage
of that type of process.

00:07:08.070 --> 00:07:09.790
I think the time
that he was studying

00:07:09.790 --> 00:07:13.560
with Schoenberg was 1918 or
'19 or something like that.

00:07:13.560 --> 00:07:17.880
So kind of an interesting time
for him to be in that orbit.

00:07:17.880 --> 00:07:19.210
But yeah, you're right.

00:07:19.210 --> 00:07:21.410
That makes it kind
of a very - I mean,

00:07:21.410 --> 00:07:24.080
a poignant connection
to these people.

00:07:24.080 --> 00:07:26.480
And with Zemlinsky,
his relationship here,

00:07:26.480 --> 00:07:30.600
I think he was actually
his employee for a time

00:07:30.600 --> 00:07:36.590
as a chorusmaster and repetiteur
and so -- at least I think for -

00:07:36.590 --> 00:07:38.930
actually, for quite a
period of five years

00:07:38.930 --> 00:07:40.260
or something like that.

00:07:40.260 --> 00:07:43.510
But yeah. So speaking
of Schoenberg,

00:07:43.510 --> 00:07:46.440
I should just mention for
those of you who don't know,

00:07:46.440 --> 00:07:49.090
the Library of Congress
has the manuscripts,

00:07:49.090 --> 00:07:51.660
the holograph manuscripts
of, I believe,

00:07:51.660 --> 00:07:55.590
every work of Schoenberg
for string quartet.

00:07:55.590 --> 00:07:56.890
And so this includes the -

00:07:56.890 --> 00:07:58.910
at least the ones
that are existent.

00:07:58.910 --> 00:08:00.210
We don't have some

00:08:00.210 --> 00:08:01.510
of the movement fragments,
the earlier ones.

00:08:01.510 --> 00:08:04.400
So I've just disqualified
everything I just said.

00:08:04.400 --> 00:08:08.250
But we do have the 1897 one
which is - they're playing

00:08:08.250 --> 00:08:10.590
and which is on display
tonight in the cases.

00:08:10.590 --> 00:08:12.700
So be sure to check that out.

00:08:12.700 --> 00:08:14.580
But, you know, it is kind
of - it's not one of -

00:08:14.580 --> 00:08:17.190
it's one of his pieces
without an opus number.

00:08:17.190 --> 00:08:21.070
What drew you to it and how did
you kind of come into the orbit

00:08:21.070 --> 00:08:23.720
of this particular piece?

00:08:23.720 --> 00:08:26.390
&gt;&gt; Milena Pajaro-Van de Stadt:
Well, for one thing we were -

00:08:26.390 --> 00:08:29.280
we were already planning on
playing the Zemlinsky quartet,

00:08:29.280 --> 00:08:32.810
and we really wanted to be
able to pair it with something

00:08:32.810 --> 00:08:35.730
from Schoenberg because
of their close

00:08:35.730 --> 00:08:39.320
and complicated relationship
with one another.

00:08:39.320 --> 00:08:42.270
And then thinking about
a piece of Schoenberg's

00:08:42.270 --> 00:08:46.160
that not only would provide a
lot of contrast to the Zemlinsky

00:08:46.160 --> 00:08:49.450
but also just kind of a glimpse
into a part of Schoenberg

00:08:49.450 --> 00:08:56.760
that people don't usually hear
was just very fascinating to us.

00:08:56.760 --> 00:08:58.060
&gt;&gt; David Plylar: To me,
the - there's almost -

00:08:58.060 --> 00:08:59.700
it almost leaps off the page.

00:08:59.700 --> 00:09:02.460
This is - the piece
was written in 1897.

00:09:02.460 --> 00:09:05.690
I think the American
Quartet was written in '94

00:09:05.690 --> 00:09:06.990
or something like that so...

00:09:06.990 --> 00:09:08.290
&gt;&gt; Milena Pajaro-Van de Stadt:

00:09:08.290 --> 00:09:09.590
People usually think it's
Dvoracek when we play it.

00:09:09.590 --> 00:09:10.890
&gt;&gt; David Plylar: Yeah.

00:09:10.890 --> 00:09:13.310
It sounds - like, the first and
final movements, it just rings -

00:09:13.310 --> 00:09:16.540
at the beginning, at
least, it rings of Dvoracek.

00:09:16.540 --> 00:09:20.210
But yet there's - have
you played, as a quartet,

00:09:20.210 --> 00:09:21.720
the other quartets
of Schoenberg?

00:09:21.720 --> 00:09:23.020
&gt;&gt; Milena Pajaro-Van
de Stadt: Not yet.

00:09:23.020 --> 00:09:24.320
I can't wait.

00:09:24.320 --> 00:09:25.620
&gt;&gt; David Plylar: You know,
it's interesting though

00:09:25.620 --> 00:09:27.060
because there's some things,
especially in the second

00:09:27.060 --> 00:09:29.650
and third movements I think,
that start to come out;

00:09:29.650 --> 00:09:36.940
that you see him picking up on
in the other quartets but...

00:09:36.940 --> 00:09:38.370
&gt;&gt; Milena Pajaro-Van
de Stadt: Yeah.

00:09:38.370 --> 00:09:39.670
&gt;&gt; David Plylar: Yeah.

00:09:39.670 --> 00:09:42.030
The - is it - so surely
you've played a lot

00:09:42.030 --> 00:09:44.340
of the Dvoracek quartets
and things like that.

00:09:44.340 --> 00:09:48.040
Are there any distinctions
from this piece?

00:09:48.040 --> 00:09:49.860
Or is it more like just
- should we think of it

00:09:49.860 --> 00:09:53.010
as this is a piece that he
wrote when he was 23 years old,

00:09:53.010 --> 00:09:54.610
kind of still in training?

00:09:54.610 --> 00:09:56.460
Or is this a piece where -

00:09:56.460 --> 00:09:57.760
&gt;&gt; Milena Pajaro-Van de Stadt:
Well, you hear - I mean,

00:09:57.760 --> 00:09:59.060
you hear - you even
hear - for me it sounds

00:09:59.060 --> 00:10:00.390
like there's a lot
of Brahms in that -

00:10:00.390 --> 00:10:05.570
in this Schoenberg
quartet as well, just --

00:10:05.570 --> 00:10:09.810
not even harmonically but also
there are certain figurations.

00:10:09.810 --> 00:10:11.510
It almost -- it feels
like, that part in the end

00:10:11.510 --> 00:10:15.670
of the last movement feels like
he's quoting Brahms almost.

00:10:15.670 --> 00:10:21.140
And it - I think it's him
finding his own voice amidst all

00:10:21.140 --> 00:10:22.950
the inspirations he had.

00:10:22.950 --> 00:10:27.890
He didn't really have any actual
formal training as a composer

00:10:27.890 --> 00:10:31.400
with the exception of his
mentorship from Zemlinsky

00:10:31.400 --> 00:10:33.350
who was three years
older than him.

00:10:33.350 --> 00:10:34.650
&gt;&gt; David Plylar: And which

00:10:34.650 --> 00:10:37.950
in this case was particularly
important for this piece.

00:10:37.950 --> 00:10:39.250
&gt;&gt; Milena Pajaro-Van
de Stadt: Yes.

00:10:39.250 --> 00:10:42.430
Yeah, Zemlinsky gave him a lot
of pointers throughout the -

00:10:42.430 --> 00:10:44.070
the scope of his
writing that piece

00:10:44.070 --> 00:10:47.750
and I think also suggested
taking things out and kind

00:10:47.750 --> 00:10:50.950
of basically helped him finalize
the piece, although he never -

00:10:50.950 --> 00:10:53.210
it wasn't published
until after he died.

00:10:53.210 --> 00:10:54.900
&gt;&gt; David Plylar: And the -
one of the interesting things

00:10:54.900 --> 00:10:57.750
about this, we don't have the -
I don't believe - I'm not aware

00:10:57.750 --> 00:11:00.340
of the original manuscript
being there for the version

00:11:00.340 --> 00:11:03.060
that he had before he
went to see Zemlinsky,

00:11:03.060 --> 00:11:04.890
which would be very
curious to see.

00:11:04.890 --> 00:11:07.250
But this is the version that
- the version that we have

00:11:07.250 --> 00:11:08.990
out here is the one he arrived

00:11:08.990 --> 00:11:11.990
at after having worked
with Zemlinsky.

00:11:11.990 --> 00:11:13.290
&gt;&gt; Camden Shaw: One
of the things

00:11:13.290 --> 00:11:14.590
that we were noticing
just looking

00:11:14.590 --> 00:11:17.250
at this manuscript a few
minutes ago was how meticulous

00:11:17.250 --> 00:11:20.400
and beautifully written
it is just in terms

00:11:20.400 --> 00:11:22.040
of the handwriting itself.

00:11:22.040 --> 00:11:24.770
And there is this - "studious"
may not be the right word,

00:11:24.770 --> 00:11:26.150
but there is a sense
that he's very,

00:11:26.150 --> 00:11:28.550
very diligent about detail.

00:11:28.550 --> 00:11:31.050
And that certainly wasn't
anything that left him later on.

00:11:31.050 --> 00:11:34.140
But his focus was on
different details.

00:11:34.140 --> 00:11:36.470
And certainly -- I
mean, Verklarte Nacht;

00:11:36.470 --> 00:11:38.890
if I had to pick a piece
today that's my favorite piece

00:11:38.890 --> 00:11:40.740
in the world, I would pick
Verklarte Nacht actually.

00:11:40.740 --> 00:11:45.780
And - and it's hard to explain
a human brain being able

00:11:45.780 --> 00:11:47.700
to produce something
like that so early.

00:11:47.700 --> 00:11:50.380
And he - so he clearly was
exhibiting an immense amount

00:11:50.380 --> 00:11:52.580
of talent and understanding
of beauty.

00:11:52.580 --> 00:11:54.410
And this piece is really
interesting in that sense

00:11:54.410 --> 00:11:56.870
that he really shows
a great understanding

00:11:56.870 --> 00:11:58.340
of - of what's beautiful.

00:11:58.340 --> 00:11:59.820
And there's some moments
in the last movement

00:11:59.820 --> 00:12:03.370
that really take you by
surprise with their clarity

00:12:03.370 --> 00:12:04.970
and - and transportiveness.

00:12:04.970 --> 00:12:06.270
It's just - it's
an amazing work.

00:12:06.270 --> 00:12:07.570
It really is.

00:12:07.570 --> 00:12:08.870
&gt;&gt; David Plylar: It seems

00:12:08.870 --> 00:12:10.170
like it's hinting
towards Verklarte Nacht

00:12:10.170 --> 00:12:13.220
in some different
passages and -- definitely.

00:12:13.220 --> 00:12:15.890
Yeah. And also the
orchestrational mastery

00:12:15.890 --> 00:12:17.190
of Verklarte Nacht.

00:12:17.190 --> 00:12:20.420
I mean, but to get there by
that time is pretty astounding,

00:12:20.420 --> 00:12:26.730
when he was -- he would
have been 25 or so.

00:12:26.730 --> 00:12:30.230
The - the second half of the
program features a composer

00:12:30.230 --> 00:12:32.870
that we should hear more
of - we just don't -

00:12:32.870 --> 00:12:36.210
Alexander von Zemlinsky
or just Zemlinsky.

00:12:36.210 --> 00:12:42.460
And as Milena mentioned, he had
a mentorship role to Schoenberg

00:12:42.460 --> 00:12:44.180
but also as a good friend.

00:12:44.180 --> 00:12:46.850
And, of course, they had a
complicated relationship --

00:12:46.850 --> 00:12:50.730
we can get into that but we
don't have to - in terms of how

00:12:50.730 --> 00:12:52.940
that played out over the years.

00:12:52.940 --> 00:12:56.640
But maybe looking
at the relationships

00:12:56.640 --> 00:12:58.940
between this particular
quartet, the second quartet

00:12:58.940 --> 00:13:03.100
which was written some 17
years after his first quartet

00:13:03.100 --> 00:13:04.820
and the - not so much
the Schoenberg piece

00:13:04.820 --> 00:13:06.120
but Schoenberg himself -

00:13:06.120 --> 00:13:07.420
&gt;&gt; Milena Pajaro-Van
de Stadt: In general.

00:13:07.420 --> 00:13:08.720
&gt;&gt; David Plylar:
-- what do you -

00:13:08.720 --> 00:13:10.210
maybe you could speak
to that a little bit.

00:13:10.210 --> 00:13:11.510
&gt;&gt; Milena Pajaro-Van
de Stadt: Well,

00:13:11.510 --> 00:13:16.460
to me the Zemlinsky quartet
shows an extreme fondness

00:13:16.460 --> 00:13:20.000
and admiration for Schoenberg,
the way that he writes it,

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:22.430
the way that - I
mean, first of all,

00:13:22.430 --> 00:13:26.820
just even centering the
structure and the key all based

00:13:26.820 --> 00:13:29.000
on Schoenberg's first quartet --

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:31.590
this isn't the one we're
playing; it's the one right

00:13:31.590 --> 00:13:35.880
after that -- and the
very obvious references

00:13:35.880 --> 00:13:41.140
to Verklarte Nacht which I think
he apparently told Schoenberg

00:13:41.140 --> 00:13:44.740
at one point that he thought it
was beautiful even though it was

00:13:44.740 --> 00:13:49.090
a little bit cheesy [laughter]
which is just shocking to me

00:13:49.090 --> 00:13:53.330
because it's one of the most
transcendent works ever heard.

00:13:53.330 --> 00:13:56.280
But then, you know, he obviously
loved it because he's - I mean,

00:13:56.280 --> 00:14:04.750
this whole incredibly emotional
and just weighty, epic piece,

00:14:04.750 --> 00:14:07.410
the Zemlinsky second
quartet, is just -

00:14:07.410 --> 00:14:09.210
it feels like it's just
swirling - you hear --

00:14:09.210 --> 00:14:12.640
you have Schoenberg swirling
around the entire time.

00:14:12.640 --> 00:14:13.940
&gt;&gt; Camden Shaw: Yeah.

00:14:13.940 --> 00:14:15.240
There's - there's
something really palpable

00:14:15.240 --> 00:14:17.680
in the structure too
that the whole last page

00:14:17.680 --> 00:14:21.180
of the Zemlinsky feels so
similar to the last page

00:14:21.180 --> 00:14:24.310
of Verklarte Nacht and some
of the moments in the coda.

00:14:24.310 --> 00:14:26.620
It's almost like when you've
known someone really well

00:14:26.620 --> 00:14:28.450
and you just find out that
they have an identical twin;

00:14:28.450 --> 00:14:29.750
and then you're looking
at the twin and it's

00:14:29.750 --> 00:14:31.050
like everything's a
little bit different

00:14:31.050 --> 00:14:33.130
but you're still
reminded of them.

00:14:33.130 --> 00:14:34.810
it's - it's kind of
surreal, actually,

00:14:34.810 --> 00:14:36.110
playing it in that sense.

00:14:36.110 --> 00:14:38.810
The pacing is really
informed by - by that.

00:14:38.810 --> 00:14:41.180
It's such a beautiful -
it's an amazing moment.

00:14:41.180 --> 00:14:42.480
&gt;&gt; David Plylar:
And I might say --

00:14:42.480 --> 00:14:45.310
this might be a little
bit irreverent to say,

00:14:45.310 --> 00:14:48.630
but in some ways you could
say that this second quartet

00:14:48.630 --> 00:14:53.180
of Zemlinsky is more radical
that Schoenberg's second quartet

00:14:53.180 --> 00:14:55.420
which has the soprano solo.

00:14:55.420 --> 00:14:58.040
And this is something that
he was very much - I mean,

00:14:58.040 --> 00:15:01.440
it dates seven or eight
years before it, I think,

00:15:01.440 --> 00:15:02.770
when he had the second quartet.

00:15:02.770 --> 00:15:05.530
But the fact that this is -

00:15:05.530 --> 00:15:10.680
while it is a multimovement-ish
kind of piece, it has this sort

00:15:10.680 --> 00:15:16.640
of single, large span that he's
kind of going across in a way

00:15:16.640 --> 00:15:21.670
that to me is pretty
darned convincing.

00:15:21.670 --> 00:15:24.790
That's a - to me, it seems
like a major accomplishment.

00:15:24.790 --> 00:15:27.840
But I would say just from
listening last night -

00:15:27.840 --> 00:15:31.280
and I don't know if I mentioned
this to you - but the -

00:15:31.280 --> 00:15:35.240
in many recordings I feel
that the complexities

00:15:35.240 --> 00:15:40.080
of the work are focused on in
a way that takes away from some

00:15:40.080 --> 00:15:43.180
of the - doesn't allow kind
of the inherent beauties

00:15:43.180 --> 00:15:44.480
of it to come through.

00:15:44.480 --> 00:15:47.120
And I think that you play it
very - with great clarity.

00:15:47.120 --> 00:15:50.350
And so it's really a
pleasure to hear this live.

00:15:50.350 --> 00:15:52.770
And I think that
you'll really enjoy it.

00:15:52.770 --> 00:15:54.690
&gt;&gt; Camden Shaw: Thanks.

00:15:54.690 --> 00:15:55.990
&gt;&gt; David Plylar: Do
we have anything else

00:15:55.990 --> 00:15:57.290
to say about Zemlinsky?

00:15:57.290 --> 00:16:02.120
Or should we - have you played
any of his other quartets?

00:16:02.120 --> 00:16:03.420
&gt;&gt; Milena Pajaro-Van
de Stadt: No.

00:16:03.420 --> 00:16:05.260
I listened to the - my fiance's
also in a string quartet,

00:16:05.260 --> 00:16:08.360
and they are big champions
of Zemlinsky's, actually.

00:16:08.360 --> 00:16:10.700
And they -- they do - they
perform the entire cycle

00:16:10.700 --> 00:16:12.680
which is for string quartets.

00:16:12.680 --> 00:16:14.740
But I - I've gotten to hear
them do that a few times.

00:16:14.740 --> 00:16:16.040
&gt;&gt; David Plylar: Oh, cool.

00:16:16.040 --> 00:16:17.340
&gt;&gt; Milena Pajaro-Van de
Stadt: And I like listening

00:16:17.340 --> 00:16:19.510
to their recording of it.

00:16:19.510 --> 00:16:22.040
&gt;&gt; David Plylar: Well, maybe you
could tell us a bit more about -

00:16:22.040 --> 00:16:24.380
I know you have a lot of things
going on right now with lots

00:16:24.380 --> 00:16:27.190
of touring and stuff,
but maybe some repertoire

00:16:27.190 --> 00:16:30.690
that you have coming up or
we could also talk a bit

00:16:30.690 --> 00:16:32.640
about your documentary
that you're working

00:16:32.640 --> 00:16:34.540
on and things like that.

00:16:34.540 --> 00:16:35.840
&gt;&gt; Camden Shaw: Yeah.

00:16:35.840 --> 00:16:37.140
&gt;&gt; David Plylar: Anything
you'd like to talk

00:16:37.140 --> 00:16:38.440
about I'd be curious to hear.

00:16:38.440 --> 00:16:39.740
&gt;&gt; Camden Shaw: Yeah,
that's true.

00:16:39.740 --> 00:16:41.040
No, I mean the documentary is -

00:16:41.040 --> 00:16:42.340
is a really exciting
project we've been working

00:16:42.340 --> 00:16:43.640
on now for more than a year.

00:16:43.640 --> 00:16:46.270
And we've had - I could say
"crew" but no, they're, like,

00:16:46.270 --> 00:16:48.040
really good friends that
have followed us around.

00:16:48.040 --> 00:16:49.340
&gt;&gt; Milena Pajaro-Van de
Stadt: Well, the director,

00:16:49.340 --> 00:16:52.850
he's actually based here
in D.C., and he is one

00:16:52.850 --> 00:16:55.450
of my personal oldest
family friends.

00:16:55.450 --> 00:16:58.050
But he - he's a fantastic
director.

00:16:58.050 --> 00:17:02.040
He made a movie years ago that
I would encourage everyone

00:17:02.040 --> 00:17:04.290
to go see called "Chops."

00:17:04.290 --> 00:17:09.150
It's - it focuses on a young
- on a young group of kids

00:17:09.150 --> 00:17:12.640
who are studying jazz
and kind of follows them

00:17:12.640 --> 00:17:14.490
from middle school
through high school.

00:17:14.490 --> 00:17:17.560
And they end up getting
accepted to the Jazz

00:17:17.560 --> 00:17:19.270
at Lincoln Center competition.

00:17:19.270 --> 00:17:22.050
And I don't want to say anything
more and give anything away.

00:17:22.050 --> 00:17:25.410
But it's a really
great, inspiring film.

00:17:25.410 --> 00:17:30.470
So when we were thinking about
how to get people who aren't

00:17:30.470 --> 00:17:34.020
in our world or aren't really
a part of the chamber music

00:17:34.020 --> 00:17:38.320
and classical music world
to see what we see in it

00:17:38.320 --> 00:17:41.350
and to be excited by
it, we thought of -

00:17:41.350 --> 00:17:43.980
his name's Bruce Broder
- we thought of Bruce

00:17:43.980 --> 00:17:46.680
because he also isn't
really a part

00:17:46.680 --> 00:17:50.530
of the classical music scene
and is fascinated by what we do.

00:17:50.530 --> 00:17:52.670
So we felt like he
would have a good -

00:17:52.670 --> 00:17:55.490
a good take on the whole thing.

00:17:55.490 --> 00:17:56.790
Yeah.

00:17:56.790 --> 00:17:59.040
&gt;&gt; David Plylar: When is it
set to be completed or...

00:17:59.040 --> 00:18:01.230
&gt;&gt; Camden Shaw: It's not -
so far we don't know exactly

00:18:01.230 --> 00:18:03.470
when it's going to be complete
in terms of a release date.

00:18:03.470 --> 00:18:04.770
Most of the -

00:18:04.770 --> 00:18:06.070
&gt;&gt; Milena Pajaro-Van de Stadt:

00:18:06.070 --> 00:18:07.370
But the editing has
been - has started.

00:18:07.370 --> 00:18:08.670
Yeah.

00:18:08.670 --> 00:18:09.970
&gt;&gt; Camden Shaw: The
editing has begun, yeah.

00:18:09.970 --> 00:18:11.270
So almost all of the footage,
at least, has been taken.

00:18:11.270 --> 00:18:12.570
If they need something else that
they feel like - for instance,

00:18:12.570 --> 00:18:13.870
one of the things
Bruce mentioned is -

00:18:13.870 --> 00:18:15.170
that can happen often

00:18:15.170 --> 00:18:16.470
in a documentary is you
catch everyone talking

00:18:16.470 --> 00:18:18.990
about something, and then you
realize you never have any

00:18:18.990 --> 00:18:20.290
footage of it.

00:18:20.290 --> 00:18:23.130
So they may find that they
have to come film us, you know,

00:18:23.130 --> 00:18:24.540
getting into a plane
or something

00:18:24.540 --> 00:18:25.840
that obviously we
do all the time

00:18:25.840 --> 00:18:28.260
but they may not
have footage of.

00:18:28.260 --> 00:18:31.170
But it's at least, you
know, 98 percent complete,

00:18:31.170 --> 00:18:32.490
the filming, which is great.

00:18:32.490 --> 00:18:34.060
&gt;&gt; David Plylar: With the
structure of the film,

00:18:34.060 --> 00:18:36.240
is it focusing on repertoire,

00:18:36.240 --> 00:18:37.980
or is it following a
tour, or what kind of -

00:18:37.980 --> 00:18:39.280
&gt;&gt; Milena Pajaro-Van de
Stadt: It's basically -

00:18:39.280 --> 00:18:42.340
the idea of it is to get behind
the scenes of what it means

00:18:42.340 --> 00:18:48.540
to be in a string quartet
specifically, full-time;

00:18:48.540 --> 00:18:52.440
being a professional
musician, classical musician.

00:18:52.440 --> 00:18:55.400
And they - they filmed
us doing everything

00:18:55.400 --> 00:18:58.650
from making ourselves
breakfast in the morning

00:18:58.650 --> 00:19:03.440
to performing a concert
in Salzburg, Austria.

00:19:03.440 --> 00:19:06.180
And they just followed us
around everywhere we went,

00:19:06.180 --> 00:19:08.850
took interviews of us,
people who knew us.

00:19:08.850 --> 00:19:12.410
They even interviewed us
about very personal things;

00:19:12.410 --> 00:19:15.720
relationship stories
and things like that.

00:19:15.720 --> 00:19:18.410
So it's - it's really getting
- it gets pretty personal,

00:19:18.410 --> 00:19:21.760
but I think the idea
is to really humanize

00:19:21.760 --> 00:19:25.290
and make what we do David
Plylar: Not a mistake.

00:19:25.290 --> 00:19:26.590
Yeah - no, it wasn't -

00:19:26.590 --> 00:19:27.890
&gt;&gt; [ Inaudible question ]

00:19:27.890 --> 00:19:29.190
&gt;&gt; David Plylar:
Well -- well, yeah.

00:19:29.190 --> 00:19:30.490
But they -

00:19:30.490 --> 00:19:31.790
&gt;&gt; I wanted to know who made
the decision [inaudible] -

00:19:31.790 --> 00:19:33.330
&gt;&gt; David Plylar: It's a
mutual - yeah, a mutual one.

00:19:33.330 --> 00:19:34.630
&gt;&gt; Milena Pajaro-Van
de Stadt: It's also -

00:19:34.630 --> 00:19:37.000
one of the great things about
having done that or being

00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:39.820
about to complete that is
the fact that we're playing

00:19:39.820 --> 00:19:42.890
on these instruments
for the first time

00:19:42.890 --> 00:19:44.300
and we're developing
miniature little -

00:19:44.300 --> 00:19:45.600
little relationships with them.

00:19:45.600 --> 00:19:46.900
So having played
an accessible and -

00:19:46.900 --> 00:19:48.200
and show how connected it
is to the rest of the world.

00:19:48.200 --> 00:19:49.500
&gt;&gt; Camden Shaw: And one
of the - the first reasons

00:19:49.500 --> 00:19:50.800
that we decided this was
almost necessary to do this was

00:19:50.800 --> 00:19:52.100
as we would travel
around the country and -

00:19:52.100 --> 00:19:53.400
and Europe especially,
people were shocked

00:19:53.400 --> 00:19:54.700
that we were classical
musicians.

00:19:54.700 --> 00:19:56.000
Always. And we - we just
kept asking ourselves,

00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:57.300
why are they shocked?

00:19:57.300 --> 00:19:58.600
What is it about us that seems
surprising or incongruous

00:19:58.600 --> 00:19:59.900
with their concept of what a
classical musician would look

00:19:59.900 --> 00:20:01.200
like or act like or dress like.

00:20:01.200 --> 00:20:02.500
Something wasn't what
most people imagined.

00:20:02.500 --> 00:20:05.180
And so we started thinking,
how can we share the reality

00:20:05.180 --> 00:20:07.510
of what it's like
so that maybe some

00:20:07.510 --> 00:20:08.930
of these misconceptions
will be -

00:20:08.930 --> 00:20:11.810
will be shattered
forever [laughter].

00:20:11.810 --> 00:20:13.320
But we'll see.

00:20:13.320 --> 00:20:15.930
It's been an exciting - exciting
and -- and as Milena said,

00:20:15.930 --> 00:20:17.420
very personal process actually.

00:20:17.420 --> 00:20:19.880
So it will be a little scary
for us to watch, I think.

00:20:19.880 --> 00:20:22.030
&gt;&gt; David Plylar: Sure.

00:20:22.030 --> 00:20:24.220
What other kinds of projects
do you have coming up?

00:20:24.220 --> 00:20:27.270
Do you have any particular,
like,

00:20:27.270 --> 00:20:30.460
programs that you're
centered on or composers

00:20:30.460 --> 00:20:31.980
that you're thinking
about focusing on?

00:20:31.980 --> 00:20:34.310
Or is it -

00:20:34.310 --> 00:20:35.610
&gt;&gt; Camden Shaw: Well -

00:20:35.610 --> 00:20:36.910
&gt;&gt; David Plylar: --
mercurial or changing?

00:20:36.910 --> 00:20:38.210
&gt;&gt; Camden Shaw: -- it's
certainly changing and I think -

00:20:38.210 --> 00:20:41.160
we just recorded our third
album this last summer

00:20:41.160 --> 00:20:43.410
of the three Schumann quartets.

00:20:43.410 --> 00:20:46.970
And that was a really wonderful
addition to our - our small

00:20:46.970 --> 00:20:49.940
but growing discography.

00:20:49.940 --> 00:20:53.150
They're wonderful pieces; very,
very romantic, very personal,

00:20:53.150 --> 00:20:56.050
and really quirky and original.

00:20:56.050 --> 00:20:58.520
And not played that often

00:20:58.520 --> 00:20:59.990
because they're fiendishly
difficult

00:20:59.990 --> 00:21:01.290
for how hard they sound.

00:21:01.290 --> 00:21:03.180
They don't sound
nearly as treacherous

00:21:03.180 --> 00:21:04.480
as they are [laughter].

00:21:04.480 --> 00:21:07.320
And so they're - they're shied
away from too much, actually.

00:21:07.320 --> 00:21:08.680
But they're - they're
wonderful pieces.

00:21:08.680 --> 00:21:10.150
So we recorded those.

00:21:10.150 --> 00:21:14.010
And then we have an exciting
- actually January coming up.

00:21:14.010 --> 00:21:16.070
Maybe you can talk a
little bit about that.

00:21:16.070 --> 00:21:17.370
&gt;&gt; Milena Pajaro-Van
de Stadt: Oh.

00:21:17.370 --> 00:21:18.670
Oh, yeah. We have some fun
things coming up in January.

00:21:18.670 --> 00:21:24.030
One of them is we have a very
short but packed tour in Europe.

00:21:24.030 --> 00:21:28.370
It's just four concerts in four
days in two different cities

00:21:28.370 --> 00:21:31.740
in Switzerland, Geneva,
Neoux, and then -

00:21:31.740 --> 00:21:34.130
or is Neoux in France?

00:21:34.130 --> 00:21:36.460
Oh, yeah. France,
Switzerland, then Germany.

00:21:36.460 --> 00:21:37.760
And then we go to Amsterdam

00:21:37.760 --> 00:21:40.900
and have our Concertgebouw
debut over there.

00:21:40.900 --> 00:21:44.790
And then the very next day
we fly back from Amsterdam

00:21:44.790 --> 00:21:48.950
to New York and have
our performance debut

00:21:48.950 --> 00:21:51.270
in the big hall at
Carnegie as a part

00:21:51.270 --> 00:21:54.330
of Janine Jansen's recital --

00:21:54.330 --> 00:21:56.710
she's doing a six-recital
series there

00:21:56.710 --> 00:21:58.940
with Jean-Yves Thibaudet,
the pianist.

00:21:58.940 --> 00:22:01.060
And we're doing the Chausson
concerto with the two

00:22:01.060 --> 00:22:03.140
of them in Stern Auditorium.

00:22:03.140 --> 00:22:04.600
So that's very exciting.

00:22:04.600 --> 00:22:05.900
&gt;&gt; David Plylar: Oh, very cool.

00:22:05.900 --> 00:22:08.780
Well, I thought - we don't
want to keep you too long

00:22:08.780 --> 00:22:10.650
so you can have a chance to
go get - back and get ready.

00:22:10.650 --> 00:22:13.600
But would you be willing to
take a couple of questions for -

00:22:13.600 --> 00:22:14.900
&gt;&gt; Milena Pajaro-Van de
Stadt: Yeah, of course.

00:22:14.900 --> 00:22:16.240
&gt;&gt; David Plylar: Anybody -
audience, what I'll ask you -

00:22:16.240 --> 00:22:19.000
we have -- Jay will come
by with a microphone.

00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:20.870
This would be just so
everybody can hear your question

00:22:20.870 --> 00:22:24.740
and we can record it so...

00:22:24.740 --> 00:22:29.160
&gt;&gt; Hi. I always like to know
the personal things here.

00:22:29.160 --> 00:22:35.240
And I - hello.

00:22:35.240 --> 00:22:39.700
Okay. I noticed on
the announcement

00:22:39.700 --> 00:22:43.790
that the music was not - was
not preannounced yesterday

00:22:43.790 --> 00:22:45.300
or tonight.

00:22:45.300 --> 00:22:48.980
And I wondered why you chose

00:22:48.980 --> 00:22:52.110
to play the same
program again tonight.

00:22:52.110 --> 00:22:55.890
I think it's an interesting
decision.

00:22:55.890 --> 00:22:57.190
So that's one question.

00:22:57.190 --> 00:22:58.830
And the other is I'm
always interested

00:22:58.830 --> 00:23:01.060
to know how musicians
come together

00:23:01.060 --> 00:23:05.900
to form whatever
group they play in.

00:23:05.900 --> 00:23:07.200
Thank you.

00:23:07.200 --> 00:23:08.500
&gt;&gt; Milena Pajaro-Van de Stadt:

00:23:08.500 --> 00:23:10.130
I thought that it was
always the same program.

00:23:10.130 --> 00:23:11.430
&gt;&gt; David Plylar: No - yeah.

00:23:11.430 --> 00:23:13.170
It was - it's - it's unusual.

00:23:13.170 --> 00:23:16.040
We used to do -- back when
the Julliard Quartet was

00:23:16.040 --> 00:23:18.960
in residence they used to
do multiple performances

00:23:18.960 --> 00:23:21.470
of the same works
over several days.

00:23:21.470 --> 00:23:23.730
It just happened to
work out this time.

00:23:23.730 --> 00:23:25.030
We don't usually do that.

00:23:25.030 --> 00:23:26.670
It happened to work
out to do it,

00:23:26.670 --> 00:23:30.190
and I think it's a fantastic
opportunity when it's possible

00:23:30.190 --> 00:23:32.470
because then you not only -

00:23:32.470 --> 00:23:37.670
&gt;&gt; So it was an [inaudible]
decision and not a decision -

00:23:37.670 --> 00:23:48.030
&gt;&gt; actual performance on them
was a huge learning experience.

00:23:48.030 --> 00:23:54.700
And then to get to do
it again once you've had

00:23:54.700 --> 00:24:08.510
that experience will
be very rewarding

00:24:08.510 --> 00:24:14.390
[ Inaudible question ]

00:24:14.390 --> 00:24:17.700
&gt;&gt; Milena Pajaro-Van de Stadt:
We'll do our best [laughter].

00:24:17.700 --> 00:24:19.980
Oh, and then how we got
together as a quartet?

00:24:19.980 --> 00:24:21.650
Was that your other question?

00:24:21.650 --> 00:24:22.950
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:24:22.950 --> 00:24:24.250
&gt;&gt; Milena Pajaro-Van
de Stadt: Well,

00:24:24.250 --> 00:24:25.550
we were all in undergrad
together

00:24:25.550 --> 00:24:26.850
at the Curtis Institute
in Philadelphia.

00:24:26.850 --> 00:24:29.450
And Camden and I,
actually our freshman year,

00:24:29.450 --> 00:24:30.750
started playing together
in a group

00:24:30.750 --> 00:24:32.820
and instantly bonded musically

00:24:32.820 --> 00:24:34.890
and really loved
playing with one another.

00:24:34.890 --> 00:24:37.400
And in the meantime, the two
violinists, Joel and Bryan,

00:24:37.400 --> 00:24:40.010
who had been at the
school a year earlier

00:24:40.010 --> 00:24:42.790
than us were already
in a quartet together,

00:24:42.790 --> 00:24:46.020
a quartet that we
both really admired.

00:24:46.020 --> 00:24:50.170
And so we really loved their
playing, especially as a pair.

00:24:50.170 --> 00:24:54.230
And eventually - I think it was
our third year at Curtis - yeah,

00:24:54.230 --> 00:24:57.720
three years in, their quartet
was kind of a little bit less -

00:24:57.720 --> 00:25:01.350
they were a little less
serious in some ways

00:25:01.350 --> 00:25:02.940
than they had been before.

00:25:02.940 --> 00:25:06.010
Their older - their other two
members were a little older.

00:25:06.010 --> 00:25:07.310
They were about to graduate.

00:25:07.310 --> 00:25:09.150
Actually, one of them
is my now-fiance.

00:25:09.150 --> 00:25:12.260
He used to be in a
quartet with them.

00:25:12.260 --> 00:25:16.230
But they - so it looked like
their quartet wasn't going to,

00:25:16.230 --> 00:25:18.390
you know, continue
as a permanent group.

00:25:18.390 --> 00:25:21.150
And so we eventually
approached the pair of them.

00:25:21.150 --> 00:25:23.020
And our topless quartet

00:25:23.020 --> 00:25:26.210
and their bottomless
quartet formed a brand-new

00:25:26.210 --> 00:25:27.510
quartet [laughter].

00:25:27.510 --> 00:25:29.510
&gt;&gt; Camden Shaw: Formed a
completely naked quartet.

00:25:29.510 --> 00:25:33.010
[ Laughter ]

00:25:33.010 --> 00:25:34.310
&gt;&gt; Camden Shaw: That's why
we're doing the same program.

00:25:34.310 --> 00:25:35.730
Tonight will be the naked one.

00:25:35.730 --> 00:25:37.840
[ Laughter ]

00:25:37.840 --> 00:25:40.470
&gt;&gt; David Plylar: I
should mention I --

00:25:40.470 --> 00:25:41.880
I completely neglected

00:25:41.880 --> 00:25:44.290
to say this is our
Stradavari anniversary concert.

00:25:44.290 --> 00:25:46.620
We usually do it on
December 18th, and that's -

00:25:46.620 --> 00:25:47.990
so we had that yesterday.

00:25:47.990 --> 00:25:50.260
But it features the instruments
that were given to us

00:25:50.260 --> 00:25:51.630
by Gertrude Clarke Whittall.

00:25:51.630 --> 00:25:52.930
And you can read
more about that.

00:25:52.930 --> 00:25:55.140
There will be an insert in your
program just to read a bit more

00:25:55.140 --> 00:25:57.170
about each of the
instruments there.

00:25:57.170 --> 00:25:59.240
Jay will pass - go ahead.

00:25:59.240 --> 00:26:00.800
&gt;&gt; Yeah. I had a
question actually relating

00:26:00.800 --> 00:26:02.100
to those instruments.

00:26:02.100 --> 00:26:06.270
How does it feel to play those
instruments, especially compared

00:26:06.270 --> 00:26:08.080
to the instruments that - you
know, I don't know what kind

00:26:08.080 --> 00:26:10.580
of instruments you usually
have the privilege of playing.

00:26:10.580 --> 00:26:14.770
But what is it - what
is it like to be...

00:26:14.770 --> 00:26:16.960
&gt;&gt; Camden Shaw: It's -
it's a lot of things.

00:26:16.960 --> 00:26:20.330
That's a great question.

00:26:20.330 --> 00:26:21.630
They're - I mean, the Strads

00:26:21.630 --> 00:26:24.340
that we're playing tonight
are incredible instruments.

00:26:24.340 --> 00:26:26.650
They're - they're
very different.

00:26:26.650 --> 00:26:30.240
And as you can imagine, so
much time has been spent trying

00:26:30.240 --> 00:26:33.320
to be accurate in terms of
dividing these enormous strings

00:26:33.320 --> 00:26:36.400
into really a, you know,
hundredth of a millimeter.

00:26:36.400 --> 00:26:39.960
So what's really hard is trying
to do that well on an instrument

00:26:39.960 --> 00:26:41.260
where all the dimensions
are different.

00:26:41.260 --> 00:26:43.030
And that's something that
we're all - you know,

00:26:43.030 --> 00:26:46.210
adjusting to a new instrument
is very difficult in that sense

00:26:46.210 --> 00:26:48.790
because your instincts of
where things are, are wrong.

00:26:48.790 --> 00:26:51.620
So you have to sort
of open up your mind

00:26:51.620 --> 00:26:56.120
to where B natural might be and
- and I actually think, though,

00:26:56.120 --> 00:26:59.390
it - I was noticing that it
changes the way, I think, your -

00:26:59.390 --> 00:27:01.800
your brain conceives of the
fingerboard when you're thrown

00:27:01.800 --> 00:27:03.920
into a new instrument
kind of situation.

00:27:03.920 --> 00:27:06.420
Because instead of
thinking in absolutes

00:27:06.420 --> 00:27:07.750
of where you know things are,

00:27:07.750 --> 00:27:11.500
you're a little bit
more exploratory and --

00:27:11.500 --> 00:27:13.910
and if - you know, you actually
end up having to be looser

00:27:13.910 --> 00:27:16.760
because if you commit to a
position that you're sure of,

00:27:16.760 --> 00:27:18.060
you're probably going
to be wrong.

00:27:18.060 --> 00:27:19.700
So there's just a sense
of a lot more fluidity

00:27:19.700 --> 00:27:21.940
which is really a great feeling.

00:27:21.940 --> 00:27:24.560
The cello is - just from
my perspective playing

00:27:24.560 --> 00:27:26.300
that is enormous.

00:27:26.300 --> 00:27:30.260
It's very large, and
so it's - it has a lot

00:27:30.260 --> 00:27:32.580
of different challenges that
I'm not used to with mine.

00:27:32.580 --> 00:27:33.880
Some of my fingerings
I had to change

00:27:33.880 --> 00:27:35.420
because I actually
couldn't reach them anymore

00:27:35.420 --> 00:27:37.560
and things like that.

00:27:37.560 --> 00:27:40.880
But it also has the best
C string I've ever heard

00:27:40.880 --> 00:27:44.360
on a cello so - so it's really
fun, and I don't really care

00:27:44.360 --> 00:27:45.660
about the challenges [laughter].

00:27:45.660 --> 00:27:46.960
It's great.

00:27:46.960 --> 00:27:48.260
&gt;&gt; Milena Pajaro-Van
de Stadt: With the -

00:27:48.260 --> 00:27:51.450
with the other instruments,
the violins and the viola,

00:27:51.450 --> 00:27:55.290
one big difference
for me - and this --

00:27:55.290 --> 00:27:57.250
this is for when you play any
instrument you've never played

00:27:57.250 --> 00:28:00.150
before - is how close the
instrument is to your ear

00:28:00.150 --> 00:28:04.060
and the sound that is coming
out is so distinctly different

00:28:04.060 --> 00:28:05.360
from what you're used to.

00:28:05.360 --> 00:28:07.510
I've played on my viola
for almost a decade now

00:28:07.510 --> 00:28:09.960
and basically never
on another one.

00:28:09.960 --> 00:28:13.050
So playing on a different viola,
it just sounds so foreign to me.

00:28:13.050 --> 00:28:16.630
And it's hard to gauge
how it's interacting

00:28:16.630 --> 00:28:19.480
with the other instruments in
the group, not mention all four

00:28:19.480 --> 00:28:21.450
of us are playing
different instruments.

00:28:21.450 --> 00:28:22.860
So then it - like, it's

00:28:22.860 --> 00:28:25.540
like a completely new
chemical reaction.

00:28:25.540 --> 00:28:27.060
It's not just changing
one ingredient.

00:28:27.060 --> 00:28:29.110
It's all the four new
ingredients and figuring

00:28:29.110 --> 00:28:32.030
out how they're responding to
one another, how the balance is,

00:28:32.030 --> 00:28:35.410
what's actually going
out to the audience.

00:28:35.410 --> 00:28:37.650
It's very challenging
and - I mean, it's -

00:28:37.650 --> 00:28:40.560
it's a great learning
experience, like I said before.

00:28:40.560 --> 00:28:41.860
&gt;&gt; Camden Shaw: It is.

00:28:41.860 --> 00:28:44.200
I mean, I think we - we don't
even realize just how much

00:28:44.200 --> 00:28:47.610
of our group sound is defined
by the instruments that we play.

00:28:47.610 --> 00:28:50.800
And so to have that completely
changed where all four of us are

00:28:50.800 --> 00:28:53.750
on different instruments throws
new assumptions into the mix

00:28:53.750 --> 00:28:56.100
of what's going to - you know,
what it's going to sound like.

00:28:56.100 --> 00:28:59.140
And actually, our - our manager
who was there last night --

00:28:59.140 --> 00:29:01.200
it was really cool, and he
didn't mean this in a bad way

00:29:01.200 --> 00:29:04.830
at all - but he's heard us
play, you know, so many times

00:29:04.830 --> 00:29:06.270
and all different
venues all the time.

00:29:06.270 --> 00:29:08.320
And so he really knows
what we sound like.

00:29:08.320 --> 00:29:10.030
And so we asked him, like,
what -- you know, what did -

00:29:10.030 --> 00:29:11.330
what did we sound like?

00:29:11.330 --> 00:29:13.010
He was, like, it
was - it was cool

00:29:13.010 --> 00:29:14.310
but it was weird [laughter].

00:29:14.310 --> 00:29:16.410
Because he's so used to
it being like - you know,

00:29:16.410 --> 00:29:17.790
he knows the way that we talk,

00:29:17.790 --> 00:29:19.790
but suddenly our voices
are completely different.

00:29:19.790 --> 00:29:21.090
&gt;&gt; Milena Pajaro-Van de Stadt:
All our voices are different.

00:29:21.090 --> 00:29:22.390
&gt;&gt; Camden Shaw: So it was -
it was really interesting.

00:29:22.390 --> 00:29:23.690
&gt;&gt; Milena Pajaro-Van
de Stadt: Yeah.

00:29:23.690 --> 00:29:24.990
&gt;&gt; Camden Shaw: It as fun.

00:29:24.990 --> 00:29:26.780
&gt;&gt; I had a question
about the Ullmann.

00:29:26.780 --> 00:29:30.510
And first I have to say that
yesterday was phenomenal,

00:29:30.510 --> 00:29:34.410
and the opportunity to
hear the program again is

00:29:34.410 --> 00:29:35.710
just incredible.

00:29:35.710 --> 00:29:37.740
So thanks to you and to
the Library and whoever -

00:29:37.740 --> 00:29:39.760
all the people who
made it possible.

00:29:39.760 --> 00:29:41.060
This is a real treat.

00:29:41.060 --> 00:29:42.360
&gt;&gt; Milena Pajaro-Van
de Stadt: Thank you.

00:29:42.360 --> 00:29:43.660
Yeah.

00:29:43.660 --> 00:29:45.560
&gt;&gt; But I have to ask about your
description of Ullmann as --

00:29:45.560 --> 00:29:47.730
the Ullmann piece as triumphal.

00:29:47.730 --> 00:29:50.540
And I know that when you learn

00:29:50.540 --> 00:29:52.780
to play a piece you have
a different relationship

00:29:52.780 --> 00:29:55.830
that certainly on
a first hearing.

00:29:55.830 --> 00:29:58.200
And to me, it just
left me tingling

00:29:58.200 --> 00:30:01.420
and especially with the contrast
of the Schoenberg which was,

00:30:01.420 --> 00:30:04.730
like, such a different,
light color.

00:30:04.730 --> 00:30:07.650
The Ullmann seemed to
me kind of apocalyptic

00:30:07.650 --> 00:30:11.390
and sort of a primal scream.

00:30:11.390 --> 00:30:16.050
And I don't know if that - you
know, how - and particularly

00:30:16.050 --> 00:30:22.270
with the CD pieces that you
have which are all kind of -

00:30:22.270 --> 00:30:25.160
of a certain emotional feel,

00:30:25.160 --> 00:30:28.150
I'd like to understand
the triumphal part.

00:30:28.150 --> 00:30:31.810
I want to help -- listen to
this [inaudible] tonight.

00:30:31.810 --> 00:30:33.210
&gt;&gt; Camden Shaw: That's a great
- well, that's a great comment.

00:30:33.210 --> 00:30:34.510
And the - the first
thing that came

00:30:34.510 --> 00:30:38.040
to my mind is all different
interpretations emotionally

00:30:38.040 --> 00:30:40.350
and -- and intellectually
looking at the manuscript

00:30:40.350 --> 00:30:41.650
of anything are -- are valid.

00:30:41.650 --> 00:30:44.710
So, you know, just because
we would feel one way if -

00:30:44.710 --> 00:30:46.040
and it has a different reaction

00:30:46.040 --> 00:30:47.640
from someone else
is completely valid.

00:30:47.640 --> 00:30:49.350
I think - I really like your
description of it, though,

00:30:49.350 --> 00:30:51.030
and I completely agree actually.

00:30:51.030 --> 00:30:53.710
I think when we're thinking
of it as triumphant,

00:30:53.710 --> 00:30:55.890
one of the things I
know we talked about was

00:30:55.890 --> 00:30:58.730
that you can tell
he was not afraid.

00:30:58.730 --> 00:31:01.500
So there's a - there's a
real strength there that's -

00:31:01.500 --> 00:31:04.370
that's quite surprising
and very strong.

00:31:04.370 --> 00:31:08.960
And so yeah, it's not a
happy triumph necessarily,

00:31:08.960 --> 00:31:10.670
but it's really potent.

00:31:10.670 --> 00:31:14.580
And it's almost like this
raging fire that's just not -

00:31:14.580 --> 00:31:15.880
&gt;&gt; Milena Pajaro-Van de
Stadt: You don't feel defeated

00:31:15.880 --> 00:31:18.410
at the end of the piece even
though it is heartbreaking.

00:31:18.410 --> 00:31:20.960
You don't - you feel empowered.

00:31:20.960 --> 00:31:22.260
&gt;&gt; Camden Shaw: Yeah.

00:31:22.260 --> 00:31:23.560
&gt;&gt; Milena Pajaro-Van
de Stadt: Yeah.

00:31:23.560 --> 00:31:24.860
&gt;&gt; Camden Shaw: Yeah.

00:31:24.860 --> 00:31:26.160
But that's - I like
- I completely agree

00:31:26.160 --> 00:31:27.460
with your - your response to it.

00:31:27.460 --> 00:31:29.760
Absolutely, yeah.

00:31:32.860 --> 00:31:34.160
&gt;&gt; Milena Pajaro-Van de Stadt:
Oh, I should mention the CD.

00:31:34.160 --> 00:31:35.460
Should I say something about it?

00:31:35.460 --> 00:31:36.760
&gt;&gt; David Plylar: Yeah, sure.

00:31:36.760 --> 00:31:38.060
Sure.

00:31:38.060 --> 00:31:39.360
&gt;&gt; Milena Pajaro-Van
de Stadt: Yeah.

00:31:39.360 --> 00:31:40.660
She - she mentioned the CD.

00:31:40.660 --> 00:31:41.960
The Ullmann that we're playing
tonight is the first piece

00:31:41.960 --> 00:31:43.260
on our newest album
that we released

00:31:43.260 --> 00:31:44.800
which is called Voices
of Defiance.

00:31:44.800 --> 00:31:51.740
And it features music written in
1943, the Viktor Ullmann; 1944,

00:31:51.740 --> 00:31:56.710
Shostakovich's Second Quartet;
and 1945, the Third Quartet

00:31:56.710 --> 00:32:02.080
by Simon Laks who survived
over two years in Auschwitz

00:32:02.080 --> 00:32:05.780
by being - basically by
being made the director

00:32:05.780 --> 00:32:08.560
of the Auschwitz orchestra.

00:32:08.560 --> 00:32:11.780
So that - and that - this
piece that's on the album

00:32:11.780 --> 00:32:13.490
of his was the first
thing he published

00:32:13.490 --> 00:32:15.090
after they liberated the camps.

00:32:15.090 --> 00:32:17.160

00:32:19.430 --> 00:32:21.820
&gt;&gt; David Plylar: I
think we have time

00:32:21.820 --> 00:32:23.560
for maybe two more
quick questions.

00:32:23.560 --> 00:32:25.990
&gt;&gt; I have another
question and - oh.

00:32:25.990 --> 00:32:29.020
I have another question
[laughter]

00:32:29.020 --> 00:32:30.340
and I think it might be quick.

00:32:30.340 --> 00:32:31.640
I don't know.

00:32:31.640 --> 00:32:32.960
But I came in and I noticed

00:32:32.960 --> 00:32:35.620
where the instruments
used to be.

00:32:35.620 --> 00:32:39.960
But you're not using any
of the Library's bows.

00:32:39.960 --> 00:32:42.280
Is this a "bring your own bow"

00:32:42.280 --> 00:32:43.580
&gt;&gt; Milena Pajaro-Van
de Stadt: BYOB.

00:32:43.580 --> 00:32:44.880
&gt;&gt; Camden Shaw: BYOB.

00:32:44.880 --> 00:32:46.310
[ Laughter ]

00:32:46.310 --> 00:32:47.670
&gt;&gt; Milena Pajaro-Van
de Stadt: It sure is.

00:32:47.670 --> 00:32:53.760
&gt;&gt; And Happy Hanukkah.

00:32:53.760 --> 00:32:56.280
&gt;&gt; David Plylar: We - some of
the ones that we have are not

00:32:56.280 --> 00:32:58.900
in - they're just not in
a condition to be played.

00:32:58.900 --> 00:33:03.750
We do have some Tourte bows
that are very unique and viable

00:33:03.750 --> 00:33:06.690
and what not but they're just
not - it wouldn't be safe

00:33:06.690 --> 00:33:09.290
for them or for the
instruments for us to use them.

00:33:09.290 --> 00:33:12.430
So they're more just a
visual thing at this point.

00:33:12.430 --> 00:33:15.770
So we always have our
artists bring in bows.

00:33:19.110 --> 00:33:22.690
I think we have one - one
more up here and then - yeah.

00:33:22.690 --> 00:33:24.870
One second.

00:33:24.870 --> 00:33:27.120
He'll give you a...

00:33:27.120 --> 00:33:28.860
&gt;&gt; While she was talking
[inaudible] the third

00:33:28.860 --> 00:33:30.190
question first.

00:33:30.190 --> 00:33:32.840
You wondered how
you would sound.

00:33:32.840 --> 00:33:36.870
Did you hear before
you did the concert?

00:33:36.870 --> 00:33:40.960
Did you hear a recording so that
you knew what you sounded like?

00:33:40.960 --> 00:33:42.740
&gt;&gt; Milena Pajaro-Van de Stadt:
We didn't listen to a recording,

00:33:42.740 --> 00:33:45.820
but we did take turns
going out into the hall

00:33:45.820 --> 00:33:48.510
and then commenting and
reacting back to one another

00:33:48.510 --> 00:33:52.010
to what we were hearing
from farther away.

00:33:52.010 --> 00:33:56.890
&gt;&gt; And -- well, the first
question was do you -

00:33:56.890 --> 00:34:01.490
assuming you know in a way that
the range from young to very old

00:34:01.490 --> 00:34:05.930
to - he never got very old -
to older and more developed,

00:34:05.930 --> 00:34:07.500
do you consider the Ullmann

00:34:07.500 --> 00:34:14.770
and Schoenberg essentially
young music but with residues -

00:34:14.770 --> 00:34:19.280
with traces of early stuff?

00:34:19.280 --> 00:34:24.550
Do you think of it as
young music in relation

00:34:24.550 --> 00:34:28.880
to what they evolved
into being as musicians?

00:34:30.510 --> 00:34:31.810
&gt;&gt; Camden Shaw: That's
a great question.

00:34:31.810 --> 00:34:36.000
I think with Ullmann we don't
know how he would have developed

00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:37.300
later -

00:34:37.300 --> 00:34:38.600
&gt;&gt; Precisely.

00:34:38.600 --> 00:34:39.900
&gt;&gt; Camden Shaw: -- and
so it's hard not to feel

00:34:39.900 --> 00:34:41.200
that it's somewhat
final in that sense.

00:34:41.200 --> 00:34:44.570
&gt;&gt; [Inaudible] triumphal
and sad and primal.

00:34:44.570 --> 00:34:47.670
So look at the situation
he was in.

00:34:47.670 --> 00:34:48.970
&gt;&gt; Camden Shaw: Yeah.

00:34:48.970 --> 00:34:50.270
&gt;&gt; David Plylar: He
was about 45, I think,

00:34:50.270 --> 00:34:51.570
when he wrote that piece.

00:34:51.570 --> 00:34:52.870
&gt;&gt; Camden Shaw: Yeah.

00:34:52.870 --> 00:34:54.170
Yeah.

00:34:54.170 --> 00:34:55.470
&gt;&gt; David Plylar: So he
had a - he had a career

00:34:55.470 --> 00:34:56.770
that had predated --

00:34:56.770 --> 00:34:58.070
that - where he had produced
quite a bit of music,

00:34:58.070 --> 00:35:00.680
unfortunately, a lot
of it lost but...

00:35:00.680 --> 00:35:02.040
&gt;&gt; Camden Shaw: It does -
that pieces, the Ullmann,

00:35:02.040 --> 00:35:06.100
does also strike me as
a little bit more sure

00:35:06.100 --> 00:35:08.770
of what he wanted to sound like.

00:35:08.770 --> 00:35:11.790
The - but that could be
just because, you know,

00:35:11.790 --> 00:35:13.650
we know how much
Schoenberg would change.

00:35:13.650 --> 00:35:14.950
It's hard to know.

00:35:14.950 --> 00:35:16.880
You know, if he hadn't changed,
we might see it as more mature.

00:35:16.880 --> 00:35:19.510
But - but this Schoenberg
does strike me a little bit

00:35:19.510 --> 00:35:22.810
as the amazing paintings
of Picasso before he -

00:35:22.810 --> 00:35:25.300
he turned to different styles.

00:35:25.300 --> 00:35:28.680
And so obviously it's so
much talent, but maybe not -

00:35:28.680 --> 00:35:32.160
he hadn't come into
his own vantage yet.

00:35:32.160 --> 00:35:34.650
&gt;&gt; But Ullmann developed on
something he had done earlier?

00:35:34.650 --> 00:35:36.440
You could hear that?

00:35:36.440 --> 00:35:38.520
&gt;&gt; Camden Shaw: Well, I'm sure
Ullmann's work developed a lot

00:35:38.520 --> 00:35:39.820
but - but -

00:35:39.820 --> 00:35:41.880
&gt;&gt; David Plylar: So there's
- there's about twenty

00:35:41.880 --> 00:35:44.680
or so pieces that
are still out there.

00:35:44.680 --> 00:35:48.300
There's a - the greatest
continuity is in the leader.

00:35:48.300 --> 00:35:51.560
There's about sixty
songs that still exist.

00:35:51.560 --> 00:35:54.790
And you can definitely trace
his - his style in there.

00:35:54.790 --> 00:35:57.930
But he also - he was - by the
time that we have things that -

00:35:57.930 --> 00:35:59.860
that -- the things that
did survive, there's a -

00:35:59.860 --> 00:36:02.210
I think that there's a -
you get the sense of him

00:36:02.210 --> 00:36:03.510
as a composer all throughout it.

00:36:03.510 --> 00:36:06.480
Unfortunately, with the string
quartets I think the only other

00:36:06.480 --> 00:36:08.470
one that - there's
an arrangement

00:36:08.470 --> 00:36:10.760
of his Schoenberg variations.

00:36:10.760 --> 00:36:12.480
So there's not -
there's not much

00:36:12.480 --> 00:36:14.720
to compare it to unfortunately.

00:36:14.720 --> 00:36:17.370
So it's hard to know whether
- you know, whether it was -

00:36:17.370 --> 00:36:18.750
would have been a departure.

00:36:18.750 --> 00:36:20.640
But it certainly is in
line with lots of his -

00:36:20.640 --> 00:36:22.830
with other instrumental
music, I think.

00:36:22.830 --> 00:36:25.370
&gt;&gt; And the last -
you're too young

00:36:25.370 --> 00:36:26.880
to have seen maybe [inaudible].

00:36:26.880 --> 00:36:29.320
Did you see the fabulous
documentary

00:36:29.320 --> 00:36:31.700
of the Guarneri Quartet?

00:36:31.700 --> 00:36:33.000
&gt;&gt; Milena Pajaro-Van
de Stadt: Oh, yes.

00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:34.300
Absolutely.

00:36:34.300 --> 00:36:38.070
&gt;&gt; The Voltaric - I
mean, the friction?

00:36:38.070 --> 00:36:44.280
[Inaudible.] I mean, it
was - it was a [inaudible].

00:36:44.280 --> 00:36:45.580
&gt;&gt; Camden Shaw: Well, you
think that was intense,

00:36:45.580 --> 00:36:47.250
just wait till our documentary.

00:36:47.250 --> 00:36:49.490
[ Laughter ]

00:36:49.490 --> 00:36:52.280
&gt;&gt; So you're open about your -

00:36:52.280 --> 00:36:53.630
&gt;&gt; Camden Shaw: Well,
I think - yeah.

00:36:53.630 --> 00:36:54.930
&gt;&gt; Milena Pajaro-Van de
Stadt: Oh, excuse me.

00:36:54.930 --> 00:36:56.230
I think there are a
lot of candid moments.

00:36:56.230 --> 00:36:58.730
We're not - and we talk
about all the difficulties

00:36:58.730 --> 00:37:02.180
and the group dynamics and how
alliances are always seeming

00:37:02.180 --> 00:37:06.070
to shift and ebb and
flow and it's - yeah.

00:37:06.070 --> 00:37:10.360
It's a tough and exciting
and rewarding life.

00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:13.740
&gt;&gt; David Plylar: On that
note, I think we do need to -

00:37:13.740 --> 00:37:15.240
to go ahead and stop here.

00:37:15.240 --> 00:37:18.580
But I'd like to thank Milena and
Camden so much for joining us.

00:37:18.580 --> 00:37:21.340
They have to go get ready to
give us a show tonight so -

00:37:21.340 --> 00:37:22.640
&gt;&gt; Milena Pajaro-Van
de Stadt: Thank you.

00:37:22.640 --> 00:37:23.940
&gt;&gt; Camden Shaw: Thanks
so much for coming.

00:37:23.940 --> 00:37:25.240
&gt;&gt; David Plylar:
-- thanks so much.
