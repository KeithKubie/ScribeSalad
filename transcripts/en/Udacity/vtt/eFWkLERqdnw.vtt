00:00:00.085 --> 00:00:01.620
&gt;&gt; We've created our action, but it's not

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:03.430
going to actually show up on the page yet.

00:00:03.430 --> 00:00:03.980
&gt;&gt; Got you.

00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:05.440
&gt;&gt; So, if we scroll down to the Page

00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:08.560
Layout section from the Objects That are Detailed page, this

00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:10.330
is exactly the same thing. You know how we

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:12.580
click on the Edit the Page Layout from the record.

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:13.031
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:00:13.031 --> 00:00:14.870
&gt;&gt; This is the other way to get to it, but from the set.

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:15.350
&gt;&gt; Edit.

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:17.910
&gt;&gt; So, we click Edit here. So, over here

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:19.933
we have Actions. There, you're way ahead of me, man.

00:00:19.933 --> 00:00:20.140
[LAUGH]

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:22.580
&gt;&gt; I'm staying there, I think, figure this out.

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:23.290
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:25.470
&gt;&gt; Okay, so, oh, Add a Set Time.

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:28.770
&gt;&gt; So, this Publisher Actions area is where you

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:32.159
want to drag it, so let's put it in there. Oh.

00:00:32.159 --> 00:00:32.920
&gt;&gt; It doesn't like it.

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:35.470
&gt;&gt; So we have to override the Global Publisher layout

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:38.680
first. There's, right now, you know we saw those actions already.

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:39.011
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:00:39.011 --> 00:00:41.600
&gt;&gt; Those are the, that's the global layout. That's just what everything

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:45.150
automatically has. But if we override that layout, we can add in our

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:45.880
own custom actions.

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:50.430
&gt;&gt; All right. Layout overridden. Adding Set Time.

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:52.570
&gt;&gt; And, put it closer to the left, so we see it.

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:53.030
&gt;&gt; Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:54.640
&gt;&gt; Maybe after Post.

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:01.890
Awesome. So, now that we have that in the layout, let's check it out.

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:07.645
&gt;&gt; So, I'm visiting the Udacity Stage, and it says, Add a Set Time.

00:01:07.645 --> 00:01:08.381
&gt;&gt; All right, yep.

00:01:08.381 --> 00:01:12.240
&gt;&gt; That's it. Oh, that's cool. Okay, so,

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:15.440
I forget when our festival was, November 29th?

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:16.030
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:19.000
&gt;&gt; So, we'll have it set on the 30th. It's New, and

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.630
the time will be, let's make it 7:00, and the band, right?

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:23.990
&gt;&gt; Let's pick someone new.

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:27.010
&gt;&gt; Yeah. I've had it with these, these three boring bands.

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:31.265
&gt;&gt; What's the word? Try the Main Ten Ants.

00:01:31.265 --> 00:01:38.510
&gt;&gt; oh yeah, I love them. Okay, and Create, and it worked. Very cool.

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:42.170
&gt;&gt; Awesome, so now, the Set Time record's created, and

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:44.290
people will know, hey, Andy created this at 6:16 p.m.

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:45.070
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm, cool.
