American Tantrum: The Donald J.
Trump Presidential Archives.

00:00:03.503 --> 00:00:05.537
I love colon titles.

00:00:05.537 --> 00:00:07.006
Oh, my gosh. So funny.

00:00:07.006 --> 00:00:10.242
I love colon titles.
I love everything to be in 900-

00:00:10.242 --> 00:00:12.378
Book. Colon.

00:00:12.378 --> 00:00:14.814
I've had a book colon before.
That's rough.

00:00:18.718 --> 00:00:21.187
Welcome back to the show, it's
You Up with Nikki Glaser.

00:00:21.187 --> 00:00:24.390
Oh, we've added someone
so special to the room today.

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:26.559
We have Anthony Atamanuik
already here

00:00:26.559 --> 00:00:28.461
from the documentary

00:00:28.461 --> 00:00:30.897
"A President Show Documentary:
The Fall of Donald Trump",

00:00:30.897 --> 00:00:33.399
which premiers tonight at 11:00
on Comedy Central.

00:00:33.933 --> 00:00:37.837
Also with us Ashley Graham.

00:00:38.337 --> 00:00:40.906
Hi. I was about to put
in a cough drop.

00:00:42.108 --> 00:00:44.410
I was like, what's she doing?
Should I say it.

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:46.179
Ashley Graham,
welcome to the show.

00:00:46.179 --> 00:00:47.447
Thank you for being here.

00:00:47.447 --> 00:00:48.681
So happy to be here.

00:00:48.681 --> 00:00:50.784
You beautiful bitch.

00:00:50.784 --> 00:00:53.386
am so excited to meet you
and see you and see you.

00:00:53.386 --> 00:00:57.924
You're just as radiant
and lovely in person

00:00:57.924 --> 00:00:59.158
as I knew you would be.

00:00:59.158 --> 00:01:00.359
Thank you.

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:01.828
And you have a new podcast out.

00:01:01.828 --> 00:01:04.697
You're not only a model,
an author, an advocate,

00:01:04.697 --> 00:01:06.866
you're now a podcaster.
Welcome to the club.

00:01:06.866 --> 00:01:08.200
Thank you.

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:09.869
I mean, it's kind of
like an intense club.

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:11.337
There's a lot of us.

00:01:11.337 --> 00:01:14.406
There's so many podcasts
and everyone goes, "Oh,

00:01:14.406 --> 00:01:16.409
I'm not gonna start a podcast.
There's already too many."

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:18.711
I'm glad you started one.
I listen to it.

00:01:18.711 --> 00:01:22.014
I listened to your first episode
and I think you are a natural.

00:01:22.681 --> 00:01:24.517
It was such a fun show
to listen to.

00:01:24.517 --> 00:01:25.718
Thank you.

00:01:25.718 --> 00:01:27.653
The podcast is called
"Pretty Big Deal".

00:01:27.653 --> 00:01:29.488
It is available on iTunes.

00:01:29.488 --> 00:01:33.960
And it came out of the gate
a fully formed great show.

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:35.428
Like you feel like
the first time

00:01:35.428 --> 00:01:37.497
you listen to a show
they're finding their bearings

00:01:37.497 --> 00:01:41.433
and they're figuring it out.
You're a natural host.

00:01:41.433 --> 00:01:44.003
Well, thank you. I have to give
so much credit to my team

00:01:44.003 --> 00:01:45.672
because everybody
was like, "Okay.

00:01:45.672 --> 00:01:48.674
This is the structure of a show
and then this is what we do

00:01:48.674 --> 00:01:50.342
and this is
how you ask questions."

00:01:50.342 --> 00:01:52.511 align:start position:0%
And I was like, "I don't know
what you're saying structure is,

00:01:52.511 --> 00:01:53.913
so I'm just gonna go ask
a bunch of questions."

00:01:53.913 --> 00:01:55.281
And they were like, "Okay."

00:01:55.281 --> 00:01:57.617
And then we just kinda went
in there and was like,

00:01:57.617 --> 00:02:00.853 align:start position:0%
"Well. That's how you not do it.
So this is how you do do it."

00:02:00.853 --> 00:02:02.455
And then we put
a little bit of structure in.

00:02:02.455 --> 00:02:04.223
Now I know
what structure is.

00:02:04.223 --> 00:02:07.693
Gotcha. So you had to mess up.

00:02:07.693 --> 00:02:09.161
You did test runs
and stuff like that?

00:02:09.161 --> 00:02:10.630
I did one test run
with my best friend,

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:12.465
which was the worst idea
ever because

00:02:12.465 --> 00:02:14.367
I know too much about her.

00:02:14.367 --> 00:02:16.502
Which I didn't know that
it was gonna be a bad idea.

00:02:16.502 --> 00:02:18.070
Who's your best friend?
Rachel.

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:19.739
Rachel [Ashwill inaudible],
she's a real estate agent.

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:21.107
I've known her
since I was 17.

00:02:21.107 --> 00:02:23.842
I was her first client
and she was my first client.

00:02:23.842 --> 00:02:25.744
Whatever.
And we ended up living together

00:02:25.744 --> 00:02:27.280
and now she's just been
my ride or die.

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:28.514
Gotcha.

00:02:28.514 --> 00:02:30.015
However, I was like,

00:02:30.015 --> 00:02:34.153
"So tell me about that time
in 2010 when you duh duh duh."

00:02:34.153 --> 00:02:36.122
And she was like,
"Bitch, if you ask me

00:02:36.122 --> 00:02:38.791
that ever again on camera,
I'm gonna kill you."

00:02:39.358 --> 00:02:41.427
And I'm like, "Oh.
Can't talk about that one."

00:02:41.427 --> 00:02:42.828
So, yeah.

00:02:42.828 --> 00:02:46.332
It's better, yes,
will we ever see that episode?

00:02:46.332 --> 00:02:48.334
No. We burnt it.
Are you kidding me?

00:02:49.568 --> 00:02:52.371
Your first episode is
with Kim Kardashian West.

00:02:52.371 --> 00:02:53.606
Yes.

00:02:53.606 --> 00:02:55.208
I went into it being like,

00:02:55.208 --> 00:02:56.509
"What am I gonna think
about this?

00:02:56.509 --> 00:02:57.877
Do I even care?

00:02:57.877 --> 00:02:59.646
I feel like I know
everything I need to know."

00:02:59.646 --> 00:03:00.913
Everybody thought that.

00:03:00.913 --> 00:03:03.049
And you did a fantastic job.

00:03:03.049 --> 00:03:05.318
First of all, I got to know
you a lot through it,

00:03:05.318 --> 00:03:06.686
which I think is important
as a host,

00:03:06.686 --> 00:03:09.656
but you didn't overtake
the conversation.

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:13.125
I felt like I knew both of you
by the end of it

00:03:13.125 --> 00:03:17.663
and I really, really love her
in a way that I didn't before.

00:03:17.663 --> 00:03:19.865
She was so open and just real

00:03:19.865 --> 00:03:21.700
and I definitely got
a few stories

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:23.035
that none of us have heard.

00:03:23.035 --> 00:03:24.236
Yes.

00:03:24.236 --> 00:03:25.471
I thought that was fantastic.

00:03:25.471 --> 00:03:27.139
I was such a fan girl
in the beginning.

00:03:27.139 --> 00:03:29.375
I was like, "And then you were
wearing this

00:03:29.375 --> 00:03:32.211
with this dress and this hair

00:03:32.211 --> 00:03:34.313
and I knew the hair dresser
that did the duh duh duh."

00:03:34.313 --> 00:03:36.282
Afterwards I was like,
"Oh, my God.

00:03:36.282 --> 00:03:38.318
I'm that idiot
that totally went in."

00:03:38.318 --> 00:03:40.520
But, the interview
was so much fun.

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:42.321
We put our feet up,
we had a great time.

00:03:42.321 --> 00:03:44.691
Yeah. You really brought out
a side of her

00:03:44.691 --> 00:03:47.260
which was that
I had never seen before.

00:03:49.228 --> 00:03:52.798
She was super intelligent
and just open

00:03:52.798 --> 00:03:55.868
and didn't seem
to be trying to-

00:03:55.868 --> 00:03:57.203
Impress anybody
or be anybody else.

00:03:57.203 --> 00:03:58.437
Yeah. Or say the right things.

00:03:58.437 --> 00:03:59.939
But that's the thing about Kim.

00:03:59.939 --> 00:04:03.242
She is a mogul.
She is super intelligent

00:04:03.242 --> 00:04:05.878
and she has done so much
to get to where she is.

00:04:05.878 --> 00:04:07.880
And if you think about it
from where she started

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:11.584
to who she is today,
that's totally unheard of

00:04:11.584 --> 00:04:14.453
for someone like that to have
a career and be where she is.

00:04:14.453 --> 00:04:19.758
So I praise her everyday,
not like how I praise God, but-

00:04:19.758 --> 00:04:22.495
Praise Jesus every morning
with a Kim verse.

00:04:23.162 --> 00:04:24.764
Praise Kim. And then she said...

00:04:24.764 --> 00:04:28.000
You and your husband do Kim
Kardashian study.

00:04:28.534 --> 00:04:32.004
But I have to say she is
definitely a role model

00:04:32.004 --> 00:04:33.473
when it comes to business.

00:04:33.473 --> 00:04:34.940
Yeah.

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:38.744
I remember reading about her
that she, really young,

00:04:38.744 --> 00:04:41.547
found a way
to resell boots on eBay?

00:04:42.681 --> 00:04:44.683
And she made
thousands of dollars

00:04:44.683 --> 00:04:46.385
as a high school student.

00:04:47.052 --> 00:04:50.823
She's a savvy business woman
and the Kanye West story

00:04:50.823 --> 00:04:53.125
that he gave her
a million dollars-

00:04:53.125 --> 00:04:54.494
On Mother's Day.

00:04:54.494 --> 00:04:56.195
On Mother's Day. So get this-

00:04:56.195 --> 00:04:57.629
I don't know this.
What is this story.

00:04:57.629 --> 00:04:58.998
You guys didn't listen
to my podcast?

00:04:58.998 --> 00:05:00.266
I'm really sorry.

00:05:00.266 --> 00:05:01.901
You didn't research.

00:05:01.901 --> 00:05:03.336
You will learn a new side of Kim
Kardashian that you didn't know.

00:05:03.336 --> 00:05:04.704
I wanna hear this, yeah.

00:05:04.704 --> 00:05:08.574
Okay, so she, how did it begin?
Because she wanted to-

00:05:09.842 --> 00:05:11.110
Okay, I'll tell the story.

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:12.611
Yes, please, sorry.

00:05:12.611 --> 00:05:15.514 align:start position:0%
So there was a brand that wanted
to pay Kim a million dollars,

00:05:15.514 --> 00:05:16.848
but it all looks kind of like

00:05:16.848 --> 00:05:19.151
Yeezy.
So Kim asked Kanye,

00:05:19.151 --> 00:05:20.786
"Do you think it's okay.
It's a lot of money."

00:05:20.786 --> 00:05:22.188
And he was like,
"I'd rather you not."

00:05:22.188 --> 00:05:23.589
And she was like,
"You know what.

00:05:23.589 --> 00:05:25.691
Because I love you
and because you're my husband,

00:05:25.691 --> 00:05:27.593
I'm gonna honor that."

00:05:27.593 --> 00:05:30.529
Cut to Mother's Day,
a man walks into the kitchen.

00:05:31.230 --> 00:05:35.701
I imagine him wearing a bow tie.
Hands her an envelope and,

00:05:35.701 --> 00:05:38.304
I'm like, first of all,
who let this man into your home?

00:05:38.304 --> 00:05:40.205
Right?
Isn't that a little creepy?

00:05:40.839 --> 00:05:42.742
Anyway, so hands her an envelope

00:05:42.742 --> 00:05:44.944
and it's a million dollar
check from Kanye

00:05:44.944 --> 00:05:48.214
and then it's also a contract
with Equity within Yeezy.

00:05:48.214 --> 00:05:49.749
And so he was like,

00:05:49.749 --> 00:05:53.219
"Thank you for always riding
with me and not taking that job.

00:05:53.219 --> 00:05:54.454
Here's a million dollars."

00:05:54.454 --> 00:05:56.255
Oh, my God. I love that.

00:05:56.255 --> 00:05:58.391
So many things about that story
I love is that a million dollars

00:05:58.391 --> 00:05:59.858
doesn't seem like a lot
to Kim Kardashian.

00:05:59.858 --> 00:06:01.093
But it was.

00:06:01.093 --> 00:06:02.694
She was like,
"That's a lot of money."

00:06:02.694 --> 00:06:04.363
She was still like, I want
a million dollars. I want this.

00:06:04.363 --> 00:06:06.065
And the contract is a...
That's crazy.

00:06:06.065 --> 00:06:07.600
The contract, yeah.

00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:09.769
Having that discussion with
your husband and being like,

00:06:09.769 --> 00:06:12.038
"This is a lot of money.
We have kids.

00:06:12.038 --> 00:06:14.507
We have a life.
Can you let me do this?"

00:06:14.507 --> 00:06:16.241
And he's just like,
"I'd rather you not."

00:06:16.241 --> 00:06:19.712
And she goes, "Okay. Yeah.
Fine." That was like such a-

00:06:19.712 --> 00:06:20.946
Loyalty.

00:06:20.946 --> 00:06:22.748
Really cute story.

00:06:22.748 --> 00:06:24.583
You've been with your husband
for eight years.

00:06:24.583 --> 00:06:25.951
Eight years we've been married.

00:06:25.951 --> 00:06:27.286
That is insane.
Congratulations.

00:06:27.286 --> 00:06:28.754
Thank you.
How long have you been together?

00:06:28.754 --> 00:06:29.988
Nine. We only dated a year.

00:06:29.988 --> 00:06:31.224
Oh wow.
What?

00:06:31.224 --> 00:06:32.425
Yeah.

00:06:32.425 --> 00:06:34.159
Wait, why did that
happen so fast?

00:06:34.159 --> 00:06:35.427
And how did you know?

00:06:35.427 --> 00:06:36.696
There's a few things.

00:06:36.696 --> 00:06:38.697
So, we met at church
and then I was like,

00:06:38.697 --> 00:06:40.199
"I don't wanna boyfriend."

00:06:40.199 --> 00:06:41.801
And he was like, "Well,
I'm gonna be your boyfriend."

00:06:41.801 --> 00:06:43.102
And then I fell in love with him
.

00:06:43.102 --> 00:06:44.470
Yeah.

00:06:44.470 --> 00:06:46.205
And we waited til
we were married to have sex.

00:06:46.205 --> 00:06:49.308
So that was something, also,
that sped the process up.

00:06:49.308 --> 00:06:52.078
Sure. I like that you admit it.

00:06:52.078 --> 00:06:53.679
Of course I'm gonna admit it.

00:06:53.679 --> 00:06:55.515
Cuz I wasn't a virgin.
I knew what I was missing.

00:06:55.515 --> 00:06:56.715
Right.

00:06:56.715 --> 00:06:58.317
Oh, so you weren't a virgin.

00:06:58.317 --> 00:06:59.886
No. We weren't virgins. No.

00:06:59.886 --> 00:07:02.321
Why did you guys decide that?
You both weren't virgins?

00:07:02.321 --> 00:07:06.425
My ex boyfriend was so terrible
and I realized that I was giving

00:07:06.425 --> 00:07:11.797
so much of myself up to men
who were not deserving of me.

00:07:11.797 --> 00:07:15.867
And as a girl who was just
dating all over New York City

00:07:15.867 --> 00:07:17.603
and I would have boyfriend
for three months here,

00:07:17.603 --> 00:07:19.471
a boyfriend
for six months there,

00:07:19.471 --> 00:07:21.873
and then I got into a really
nasty relationship with a guy.

00:07:21.873 --> 00:07:24.176
I was like,
"I'm giving it up too soon.

00:07:24.176 --> 00:07:26.112
And I'm not making
these guys work for it.

00:07:26.112 --> 00:07:28.314
I'm not valuing who I am."

00:07:28.314 --> 00:07:31.984
So the next guy I date,
he's not getting any of this

00:07:31.984 --> 00:07:33.485
until at least I see
a ring on my finger.

00:07:33.485 --> 00:07:35.421
Then I decided
it's not just a ring.

00:07:35.421 --> 00:07:37.123
It's gotta be the wedding day.

00:07:37.623 --> 00:07:40.226
So then I met my husband and
sure enough we met in church.

00:07:40.226 --> 00:07:42.728
Made it a lot easier because
we had the same believe system.

00:07:42.728 --> 00:07:44.163
Yeah.
Right, right.

00:07:44.163 --> 00:07:45.664
So I didn't have to convince
someone like, "No.

00:07:45.664 --> 00:07:47.599
Trust me.
It's gonna work out."

00:07:48.633 --> 00:07:51.269
But it's worked out. We've been
married for eight years.

00:07:51.269 --> 00:07:53.973
I love this story because it
is validating

00:07:53.973 --> 00:07:56.175
everything that I am doing
with my life right now.

00:07:56.175 --> 00:07:57.877
Really? Are you celibate?

00:07:58.477 --> 00:08:02.148
Yeah. I pretty much am.
You don't get anything until...

00:08:02.715 --> 00:08:04.383
And it's not even
marriage for me,

00:08:04.383 --> 00:08:06.285
but it's until
you prove yourself.

00:08:07.019 --> 00:08:11.623
You set your own parameters,
but I'm done being this girl.

00:08:11.623 --> 00:08:15.094
I think we grow up
as women thinking...

00:08:15.628 --> 00:08:17.663
we've been sold this lie
about blue balls

00:08:17.663 --> 00:08:20.599
and how if a guy doesn't finish
he's gonna hate us

00:08:20.599 --> 00:08:23.602
and he's gonna be mad at us
and we're gonna be bad women.

00:08:23.602 --> 00:08:26.371
And it's not men that are
necessarily perpetuating this,

00:08:26.371 --> 00:08:28.407
it's just something that has
gotten into our consciousness

00:08:28.407 --> 00:08:30.176
as women that they need,

00:08:30.176 --> 00:08:32.411
if you engage
in a hook up with a guy,

00:08:32.411 --> 00:08:35.114
if he doesn't finish then
there's something wrong-

00:08:35.114 --> 00:08:36.549
Then you did
something mean to him.

00:08:36.549 --> 00:08:38.684
You did something wrong
and he might not call you,

00:08:38.684 --> 00:08:41.454
he might not get you
an Uber home, or whatever it is.

00:08:41.454 --> 00:08:44.156
You know what, usually if you
don't finish him off

00:08:44.156 --> 00:08:45.657
then he does call you.

00:08:45.657 --> 00:08:50.529 align:start position:0%
Exactly. Cuz you finish them off
over and over and you realize

00:08:50.529 --> 00:08:52.231
even when you do finish them

00:08:52.231 --> 00:08:54.199
they still do
all those things anyway.

00:08:54.199 --> 00:08:56.001
They talk bad about you behind
your back and all the things.

00:08:56.001 --> 00:08:57.403
Men are hunters.
They want something to hunt.

00:08:57.403 --> 00:09:00.872
And they also want something
to be able to say,

00:09:01.439 --> 00:09:03.709
"I got her and I did it
the right way."

00:09:03.709 --> 00:09:05.844
That was something
that I learned in dating

00:09:06.478 --> 00:09:09.148
at least half of the assholes
in New York City.

00:09:09.148 --> 00:09:11.850
Yeah. It's my new thing
and I like to hear

00:09:11.850 --> 00:09:13.852
that you actually waited
til marriage

00:09:13.852 --> 00:09:16.255
and that this wasn't...
you'd already had sex before.

00:09:16.255 --> 00:09:17.523
Yeah.

00:09:17.523 --> 00:09:18.757
You knew what you were
missing out on.

00:09:18.757 --> 00:09:21.026
A lot of it.
But you knew that having sex-

00:09:21.026 --> 00:09:23.395
It's also the person.

00:09:23.395 --> 00:09:24.896
You need to keep something.

00:09:24.896 --> 00:09:26.098
It's the person too.
It's who the person is.

00:09:26.098 --> 00:09:27.599
Yes.

00:09:27.599 --> 00:09:31.938
Just sex alone with someone is
not necessarily an intimate act.

00:09:33.471 --> 00:09:35.874
It has to be with
the person you care about.

00:09:35.874 --> 00:09:38.143
I can't believe
I'm participating in this...

00:09:38.143 --> 00:09:39.545
But it's true.

00:09:39.545 --> 00:09:42.614
I think that intimacy,
90% of intimacy

00:09:42.614 --> 00:09:45.350
is about your eyes,
your touch,

00:09:45.350 --> 00:09:46.986
and all the things
that matter around that.

00:09:46.986 --> 00:09:48.487
Yep.

00:09:48.487 --> 00:09:52.557 align:start position:0%
Just tickling the pickle is this
sort of neural discharge part

00:09:52.557 --> 00:09:55.728
of it that's totally different.
And I mean, a lot of discharge.

00:09:58.864 --> 00:10:03.402
Wait. I think I vomited
in my mouth a little bit.

00:10:04.637 --> 00:10:07.005
How did that go over?
Was he like, I'm down?

00:10:07.005 --> 00:10:08.306
And then you guys got married.

00:10:08.306 --> 00:10:09.874
Had he had sex before?

00:10:09.874 --> 00:10:11.109
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:10:11.109 --> 00:10:12.444
Oh, okay.
So you both were just like,

00:10:12.444 --> 00:10:13.845
"This is what we're
gonna do together."

00:10:13.845 --> 00:10:17.015
Yeah. He was down and,
I don't know, it just worked.

00:10:17.015 --> 00:10:18.750
And then so we made a deal

00:10:18.750 --> 00:10:20.819
where we wouldn't sleep over
at each other's homes

00:10:20.819 --> 00:10:24.656
because we knew if we did then,
hello, morning wood.

00:10:24.656 --> 00:10:28.094
Morning [inaudible 00:10:26].
We know how it goes down.

00:10:28.827 --> 00:10:30.396
Yes.

00:10:30.396 --> 00:10:33.665
So we did these 24 hour dates
where he would pick me up

00:10:33.665 --> 00:10:35.167
and it would be in the evening.

00:10:35.167 --> 00:10:37.803
We would spend the whole night
out just walking around the city

00:10:37.803 --> 00:10:40.606
or going to shows,
25 hour diners.

00:10:41.340 --> 00:10:43.175
And then we would spend
the whole day together.

00:10:43.175 --> 00:10:44.643
We really got to know each other

00:10:44.643 --> 00:10:47.746
and we built this friendship
that you cannot destroy

00:10:47.746 --> 00:10:51.417
because our trust,
our communication is so on point

00:10:51.417 --> 00:10:54.453
that today we can literally be
so blunt with each other

00:10:54.453 --> 00:10:56.622
and then just go right
into lovey dovey mode.

00:10:56.622 --> 00:10:59.825
Right. By these 24 hour
dates you mean

00:10:59.825 --> 00:11:04.463
that you weren't alone
in a bedroom together.

00:11:05.064 --> 00:11:07.399
We would sometimes go over
to each other's homes

00:11:07.399 --> 00:11:09.468
and watch movies
or just hang out.

00:11:09.468 --> 00:11:11.803
We weren't sleeping
in the same bed.

00:11:11.803 --> 00:11:13.172
You weren't setting yourself up.

00:11:13.172 --> 00:11:14.506
Yeah, exactly.
You're right.

00:11:14.506 --> 00:11:16.708
It will happen if you
put yourself in that position

00:11:16.708 --> 00:11:18.778
because you get horned up enough

00:11:18.778 --> 00:11:20.245
you start making deals
with yourself.

00:11:20.245 --> 00:11:21.513
We were making out.

00:11:21.513 --> 00:11:23.448
He's not gonna be weird
after this.

00:11:23.448 --> 00:11:24.717
I'm just gonna do it.

00:11:24.717 --> 00:11:26.952
And I just can't,
if you do have sex

00:11:26.952 --> 00:11:29.755
with someone too soon, girls
who are listening, it's okay.

00:11:29.755 --> 00:11:31.823
You can always get
that power back.

00:11:31.823 --> 00:11:34.293
But just try to hold out
as long as you can.

00:11:34.293 --> 00:11:37.863
It's never a bad idea.
It really is never a bad idea.

00:11:37.863 --> 00:11:41.100
I've never seen it backfire
on a girl to hold back.

00:11:41.100 --> 00:11:42.367
Never.

00:11:42.367 --> 00:11:46.172
To not text first,
to not withhold sex.

00:11:47.639 --> 00:11:50.309
It is withholding, but you're
doing it for yourself.

00:11:50.309 --> 00:11:51.877
You're not doing it
to punish him.

00:11:51.877 --> 00:11:53.478
I don't think it's withholding
when you haven't

00:11:53.478 --> 00:11:55.014
already given it.

00:11:55.014 --> 00:11:56.081
That's a good point.
You know what I'm saying?

00:11:56.081 --> 00:11:57.282
That's a really good point.

00:11:57.282 --> 00:11:58.717
It's not yours.

00:11:58.717 --> 00:11:59.985
It also shouldn't be
transactional, personally.

00:11:59.985 --> 00:12:01.520
Yeah. Yeah.

00:12:01.520 --> 00:12:03.956
I think that the whole idea
should be you wanna weed out

00:12:03.956 --> 00:12:06.058
the pressuring,
toxic masculinity

00:12:06.058 --> 00:12:07.492
and sort of garbage-

00:12:07.492 --> 00:12:08.794
Yeah.
-that floats around.

00:12:08.794 --> 00:12:10.195
And that's exactly
what happened with me.

00:12:10.195 --> 00:12:11.463
I started dating guys
and they were like,

00:12:11.463 --> 00:12:13.131
"What. You're waiting? Why?"

00:12:13.131 --> 00:12:14.800
And then they would try
to hook up with me,

00:12:14.800 --> 00:12:16.869
I'm like,
"No, you don't understand."

00:12:16.869 --> 00:12:18.637
And then they wouldn't
call me back.

00:12:18.637 --> 00:12:19.872
And you weed through the guys

00:12:19.872 --> 00:12:21.373
who just wanna
have sex with you.

00:12:21.373 --> 00:12:24.443
Yes. You saying "I'm not
gonna have sex with you"

00:12:24.443 --> 00:12:25.944
doesn't always work.
It's not like that guy

00:12:25.944 --> 00:12:27.246
is just gonna chase you
to the end of the world.

00:12:27.246 --> 00:12:28.914
No.

00:12:28.914 --> 00:12:30.015
They'll give up if they're not
really meant to be with you.

00:12:30.015 --> 00:12:31.216
Yeah. But that's part of it.

00:12:31.216 --> 00:12:32.717
They're not all that thirsty.

00:12:32.717 --> 00:12:34.653
I think if there are people
who like to have a lot of sex

00:12:34.653 --> 00:12:36.922
and they all like it and all
those people meet each other

00:12:36.922 --> 00:12:38.490
and they're fine
without commitment.

00:12:38.490 --> 00:12:40.592
I'm saying those folks
should go for it too.

00:12:40.592 --> 00:12:42.261
I don't think
there's one right way,

00:12:42.261 --> 00:12:44.562
but I think that
the problem is that,

00:12:44.562 --> 00:12:46.164
or at least hearing
what you're saying,

00:12:46.164 --> 00:12:48.433
is the worst one
is the sort of pressuring,

00:12:48.433 --> 00:12:51.570
and the blue balls,
and come on and I can do it.

00:12:51.570 --> 00:12:55.174 align:start position:0%
And the thing that any young man
who's past through their 20s,

00:12:55.174 --> 00:12:57.909
especially if you grew up
in the '70s and '80s,

00:12:57.909 --> 00:13:00.312
that was the language
you were taught as a man.

00:13:00.312 --> 00:13:01.813
Yes.

00:13:01.813 --> 00:13:04.482
It's a hard one to undo.
And you have to undo it.

00:13:04.482 --> 00:13:06.452
All the men out there, undo it.

00:13:06.452 --> 00:13:09.054
I feel like anyone who went
through the D.A.R.E program

00:13:09.054 --> 00:13:14.627
was also given this aside
propaganda session of blue balls

00:13:14.627 --> 00:13:17.963
and how if you wanna guy
to like you he's gotta finish.

00:13:19.631 --> 00:13:22.067
I'm talking to myself here,
by the way.

00:13:22.067 --> 00:13:23.535
You are an angel
to me right now.

00:13:23.535 --> 00:13:25.103
Aw.

00:13:25.103 --> 00:13:28.741
I already look up to you and
to hear you say that that's...

00:13:28.741 --> 00:13:30.842
And your relationship has been
eight years strong now,

00:13:30.842 --> 00:13:33.679
which is, to be a young girl
married for eight years

00:13:33.679 --> 00:13:35.781
is something to celebrate.

00:13:35.781 --> 00:13:37.349
Yeah. We got married
when I was 22.

00:13:37.349 --> 00:13:40.552
That's crazy. And you can tell,
the way you speak of him,

00:13:41.353 --> 00:13:43.956
you can tell how good
your marriage is.

00:13:43.956 --> 00:13:45.457
I'm just projecting, but.

00:13:45.457 --> 00:13:47.726
That's the other thing.
Marriage is not an easy road.

00:13:47.726 --> 00:13:49.695
You've got your peaks
and your valleys

00:13:49.695 --> 00:13:51.897
and you just have to remember
are you both committed.

00:13:51.897 --> 00:13:53.732
Are you both
gonna stay in this?

00:13:53.732 --> 00:13:56.167
I think that the other thing
that people don't talk about

00:13:56.167 --> 00:13:57.970
is the highs
and lows in marriage

00:13:57.970 --> 00:14:00.739
and especially
when you're younger.

00:14:00.739 --> 00:14:02.407
And our fifth year
was our hardest year.

00:14:02.407 --> 00:14:04.576
It's because we didn't get
to see each other very much.

00:14:04.576 --> 00:14:06.345
We fought and we were like,
what are we doing?

00:14:06.345 --> 00:14:08.480
Why are we married?
What's the whole situation?

00:14:08.480 --> 00:14:09.681
Wow.

00:14:09.681 --> 00:14:11.550
And I think that if you remember

00:14:11.550 --> 00:14:13.218
you made a commitment
to each other

00:14:13.218 --> 00:14:16.888
and if you both work your asses
off to stay committed,

00:14:16.888 --> 00:14:20.258
to stay connected,
to stay communicating,

00:14:20.258 --> 00:14:21.893
there's nothing
that can tear you up.

00:14:21.893 --> 00:14:23.395
Unless if one of you, you know.

00:14:23.395 --> 00:14:26.265
What is the work? Give me
one specific thing that is work?

00:14:27.832 --> 00:14:29.835
Cuz you hear that.

00:14:29.835 --> 00:14:31.703
When my husband and I
have an argument.

00:14:31.703 --> 00:14:33.471
You know that tension
that's still left in the air

00:14:33.471 --> 00:14:35.107
where you're like,

00:14:35.107 --> 00:14:36.775
"Okay. We're over it but we're
still pissed at each other."

00:14:36.775 --> 00:14:38.043
You're like, slamming drawers.

00:14:38.043 --> 00:14:39.578
The spirit of the fight.
Yeah.

00:14:39.578 --> 00:14:42.114
The fight is disembodied
from you and it just exists.

00:14:42.114 --> 00:14:43.449
There's nothing else to discuss.

00:14:43.449 --> 00:14:44.682
Right.

00:14:44.682 --> 00:14:46.284
But you've both said
you're sorry.

00:14:46.284 --> 00:14:48.988
So we have this game
where we play the nice game.

00:14:48.988 --> 00:14:51.823
And whoever says,
"Let's play the nice game."

00:14:51.823 --> 00:14:53.759
The other person has to say

00:14:53.759 --> 00:14:56.262
something nice
about the other one.

00:14:56.262 --> 00:14:58.764
So if I say to Justin,
"Let's play the nice game."

00:14:58.764 --> 00:15:00.265
He has to say
something nice about me

00:15:00.265 --> 00:15:02.067
and then I have to say
something nice about him.

00:15:02.067 --> 00:15:03.635
It cannot be physical
because, duh,

00:15:03.635 --> 00:15:05.270
we're both attracted
to each other

00:15:05.270 --> 00:15:07.872
and it can't be something
that's surface level like,

00:15:07.872 --> 00:15:09.841
"I really like how you cleaned
the dishes today."

00:15:09.841 --> 00:15:11.477
Right.
Okay.

00:15:11.477 --> 00:15:15.147
Right? And if you're the person
who doesn't say the nice thing

00:15:15.147 --> 00:15:18.250
then you're the first person
on the face of the Earth

00:15:18.250 --> 00:15:20.552
that ever cheated
on the nice game.

00:15:21.219 --> 00:15:22.854
So then we shun each other.

00:15:22.854 --> 00:15:25.591
It's like, "Oh, okay.
You're the first person ever."

00:15:25.591 --> 00:15:27.993
So you're the first one
to lost this game.

00:15:27.993 --> 00:15:30.162
Yes. So you have
to say something nice.

00:15:30.162 --> 00:15:33.332
And what that does is it creates
this loving connection again

00:15:33.332 --> 00:15:34.699
because you have...

00:15:34.699 --> 00:15:36.368
it's kind of like
saying affirmations

00:15:36.368 --> 00:15:41.473
or saying gratitude to your day
in telling this person,

00:15:42.174 --> 00:15:44.676
"Thank you for supporting me
through this decision."

00:15:44.676 --> 00:15:48.380
Or "Thank you so much for
taking the time to care for me."

00:15:48.380 --> 00:15:50.582
Whatever it is.
And it's like, okay.

00:15:51.116 --> 00:15:52.984
We're back to square one
and everything's fine.

00:15:52.984 --> 00:15:54.419
Yeah. The nice game.
I love that.

00:15:54.419 --> 00:15:55.887
I like it a lot.

00:15:55.887 --> 00:15:58.323
You have to be so selfless
when you're married.

00:15:58.323 --> 00:16:01.092
Because everything is about
that person and vice versa.

00:16:01.793 --> 00:16:03.628
Every guard has to go down.

00:16:03.628 --> 00:16:05.797
And that is something that is
very, very hard for people.

00:16:05.797 --> 00:16:07.031
Yes.

00:16:07.031 --> 00:16:08.400
And hard to maintain and do

00:16:08.400 --> 00:16:10.101
and a lot of times
you fail at it, but you try.

00:16:10.101 --> 00:16:11.470
Of course.

00:16:11.470 --> 00:16:13.004
And I think the other one
is there are things

00:16:13.004 --> 00:16:15.707
about your partner
that you just never will like.

00:16:15.707 --> 00:16:18.410
Yeah. The 80/20 rule.
When you're dating.

00:16:18.410 --> 00:16:19.644
Yeah, exactly.

00:16:19.644 --> 00:16:20.946
Have you ever heard
of the 80/20 rule?

00:16:20.946 --> 00:16:23.281
I haven't, but I can guess.
But, tell me.

00:16:23.281 --> 00:16:27.485
If you're dating someone it has
to be 80%

00:16:27.485 --> 00:16:29.554
of what this person gives that
you're obsessed with,

00:16:29.554 --> 00:16:31.222
the other 20% is kind of like,
okay, whatever,

00:16:31.222 --> 00:16:32.524
I'll just deal with it.

00:16:32.524 --> 00:16:33.892
Right.

00:16:33.892 --> 00:16:36.261
But if it's like 70% is great
and 30% is like,

00:16:36.261 --> 00:16:38.496
oh, hell no,
then you have to walk away

00:16:38.496 --> 00:16:40.232
because that 30%
will get under your skin.

00:16:40.232 --> 00:16:41.532
Oh, man.
But you can take 20.

00:16:41.532 --> 00:16:43.435
It'll destroy it eventually.

00:16:43.435 --> 00:16:44.669
No one's perfect.

00:16:44.669 --> 00:16:46.338
It's hard to math
that out though.

00:16:46.905 --> 00:16:48.139
Are you making a chart?

00:16:48.139 --> 00:16:49.341
You figure it out.

00:16:49.341 --> 00:16:51.309
It's experiencing when you go,
"Oh."

00:16:51.309 --> 00:16:54.012
The relief of going,
"I don't have to fix this.

00:16:54.012 --> 00:16:57.515
I'm not here to change it.
This is just a part of them

00:16:57.515 --> 00:17:01.153
and I just gotta accept it
and stop being crazy about it."

00:17:01.153 --> 00:17:03.755
And our thing we do,
"Can I make a confession?"

00:17:03.755 --> 00:17:06.792
And a confession is when you say
something you're feeling

00:17:06.792 --> 00:17:11.096
and your partner does not
comment, respond, or anything.

00:17:11.096 --> 00:17:13.298
You just say it
and then you go, "I'm done."

00:17:13.999 --> 00:17:16.067
And the thing
is being listened to

00:17:16.968 --> 00:17:19.204
is the number one thing
that gets lost in the shuffle.

00:17:19.204 --> 00:17:20.405
Yeah.

00:17:20.405 --> 00:17:22.073
Is truly being listened to.

00:17:22.073 --> 00:17:25.010
And you wanna fix, cuz you love,
and you wanna try to do...

00:17:25.010 --> 00:17:26.678
And so it's a really
good way of going,

00:17:26.678 --> 00:17:28.079
"I gotta make a confession.

00:17:28.079 --> 00:17:29.847
I'm really anxious
about going to this party

00:17:29.847 --> 00:17:31.383
and doing this thing."

00:17:31.383 --> 00:17:33.519
And then you just let it go cuz
sometimes you just wanna say it.

00:17:33.519 --> 00:17:35.487
It's not about it being fixed.
You just wanna say it.

00:17:35.487 --> 00:17:36.722
And not be judged, yeah.

00:17:36.722 --> 00:17:38.156
You wanna be heard.

00:17:38.156 --> 00:17:41.326
I think when I look back
on my relationships

00:17:41.326 --> 00:17:43.262
and I'm kind of
getting back together

00:17:43.262 --> 00:17:45.897
with someone I've been off
and on for six years-

00:17:45.897 --> 00:17:47.198
Why?

00:17:47.198 --> 00:17:49.034
Because I'm realizing
the 80/20 thing.

00:17:49.034 --> 00:17:51.870
And I'm realizing I always
broke up because of the 20

00:17:51.870 --> 00:17:54.372
and that the 80 really,
I've dated other people,

00:17:54.372 --> 00:17:55.874
and I joke about it,

00:17:55.874 --> 00:17:58.610
but when I date other people
I look at my ex and I go,

00:17:58.610 --> 00:18:00.878
"Oh, my God.
He's the best I can do."

00:18:01.713 --> 00:18:05.417
Because I feel like I did
really well five years ago

00:18:05.417 --> 00:18:06.685
and I've dated since then

00:18:06.685 --> 00:18:09.120
and you just compare
and you go, "No.

00:18:09.120 --> 00:18:11.422
That was pretty great.
What am I doing?"

00:18:11.422 --> 00:18:14.226
And he's grown over time
and I've grown over time.

00:18:14.226 --> 00:18:16.195
But something
that I really didn't realize,

00:18:16.195 --> 00:18:17.896
and I think would help
in a marriage

00:18:17.896 --> 00:18:19.264
or a long term relationship,

00:18:19.264 --> 00:18:22.300
is, honestly,
just empathy and being like,

00:18:22.300 --> 00:18:24.269
"They're a different person
than I am.

00:18:24.269 --> 00:18:25.604
And they're interpreting

00:18:25.604 --> 00:18:28.407
everything
from a different perspective."

00:18:28.407 --> 00:18:31.843
I don't know why I never even
grasped that until this year.

00:18:31.843 --> 00:18:33.278
But, literally, I just,
every time

00:18:33.278 --> 00:18:35.913
we would get in a fight
I only saw things

00:18:35.913 --> 00:18:39.685
from I would never
treat him that way,

00:18:39.685 --> 00:18:40.953
so he must not love me.

00:18:40.953 --> 00:18:42.621
That has to do
with your love language.

00:18:42.621 --> 00:18:43.889
Yeah.

00:18:43.889 --> 00:18:45.724
I feel like I'm doing
this love counseling.

00:18:45.724 --> 00:18:47.793
See, I told you. You're good.

00:18:47.793 --> 00:18:49.194
Yeah.

00:18:49.194 --> 00:18:51.863
Have you guys ever read
The Five Love Languages?

00:18:51.863 --> 00:18:53.398
I know of it.
No.

00:18:53.398 --> 00:18:55.968
Okay. We read it on our
honeymoon because we're dorks.

00:18:55.968 --> 00:18:57.201
Whoa.

00:18:57.201 --> 00:18:59.704
And my love language is acts
of service

00:18:59.704 --> 00:19:01.806
and his is physical touch
and time spent.

00:19:01.806 --> 00:19:03.242
I could never touch you, like,

00:19:03.242 --> 00:19:04.776
maybe we'll have sex
and it'll be great

00:19:04.776 --> 00:19:08.647
but I don't wanna be touched
when I walk in the door

00:19:08.647 --> 00:19:10.382
and I don't need
to speak to you.

00:19:10.382 --> 00:19:11.583
He needs both of those things.

00:19:11.583 --> 00:19:13.351
Oh, yeah.
Men usually do.

00:19:13.351 --> 00:19:15.253
I'm like, "Touch me.
Touch me for God's sake."

00:19:15.253 --> 00:19:16.688
And they wanna spend time.

00:19:16.688 --> 00:19:18.923
And I'm like, okay, if you got
everything on the To

00:19:18.923 --> 00:19:21.226
Do list done,
if you booked that vacation,

00:19:21.226 --> 00:19:23.595
if you did duh duh duh for me,
then oh, my God.

00:19:23.595 --> 00:19:25.096
I'll do anything
you want me to.

00:19:25.096 --> 00:19:26.631
Whoa.
Interesting.

00:19:26.631 --> 00:19:29.134
So, this love language
is you love the way

00:19:29.134 --> 00:19:30.569
that you wanna be loved.

00:19:30.569 --> 00:19:32.637
And he's loving you the way
he wants to be loved.

00:19:32.637 --> 00:19:35.006
So you have to understand
each other's love language

00:19:35.006 --> 00:19:36.708
in order to love that person.

00:19:38.643 --> 00:19:40.512
Why would you want me
to touch you all the time?

00:19:40.512 --> 00:19:41.713
That's ridiculous.

00:19:41.713 --> 00:19:42.948
Cuz you don't wanna be touched.

00:19:42.948 --> 00:19:44.816
How annoying. Right?

00:19:44.816 --> 00:19:47.852
And he's like, "No, no.
Please rub my head. I love it."

00:19:47.852 --> 00:19:50.088
And I'm like,
"Oh, here we go again."

00:19:50.889 --> 00:19:52.257
But now when I rub his head

00:19:52.257 --> 00:19:54.425
then he does all the things
I want him to do.

00:19:55.593 --> 00:20:02.233
The love language book is legit.
People have such a... even me.

00:20:02.233 --> 00:20:05.270
I'm working on having empathy
and I realize it's something

00:20:05.270 --> 00:20:07.138
that you put yourself
in someone else's shoes,

00:20:07.138 --> 00:20:09.407
but I only have my shoes.

00:20:09.407 --> 00:20:11.643
And it's so hard
to imagine other shoes.

00:20:11.643 --> 00:20:13.411
But, that is one way to do it

00:20:13.411 --> 00:20:15.813
is to just read
that book your honeymoon.

00:20:16.614 --> 00:20:18.149
It's gotta have helped.

00:20:18.149 --> 00:20:19.417
It did. It really did.

00:20:19.417 --> 00:20:21.986
And the human psyche
is a congress.

00:20:21.986 --> 00:20:25.356
In a way you can understand
or empathize in the sense

00:20:25.356 --> 00:20:26.758
that there's a part of you

00:20:26.758 --> 00:20:30.162
that is more representative
of that other person.

00:20:30.162 --> 00:20:32.864
It's just the captain
that drives the ship,

00:20:32.864 --> 00:20:35.033
the part of you that's you
is the primary part,

00:20:35.033 --> 00:20:36.868
but there's all these
other shades and parts

00:20:36.868 --> 00:20:38.737
so when you're interacting
with your partner

00:20:38.737 --> 00:20:40.472
you're also playing out
all of your family systems.

00:20:40.472 --> 00:20:41.706
Yes.

00:20:41.706 --> 00:20:43.274
All of the different
relationships

00:20:43.274 --> 00:20:44.976
you've had throughout your life.

00:20:45.777 --> 00:20:48.679
It's a complex mess
that sometimes works out

00:20:48.679 --> 00:20:51.116
and if it's really good you
get dinner.
