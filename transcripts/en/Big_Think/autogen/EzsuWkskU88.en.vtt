so discrimination and bias and

00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:02.970
so discrimination and bias and
 

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:06.019
so discrimination and bias and
inequities is one of the most important

00:00:06.019 --> 00:00:06.029
inequities is one of the most important
 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:08.960
inequities is one of the most important
topics of the day today one of the

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:08.970
topics of the day today one of the
 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:11.060
topics of the day today one of the
reasons why is that many many companies

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:11.070
reasons why is that many many companies
 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:14.079
reasons why is that many many companies
are becoming increasingly diverse

00:00:14.079 --> 00:00:14.089
are becoming increasingly diverse
 

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:16.790
are becoming increasingly diverse
companies value diversity they think

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:16.800
companies value diversity they think
 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:19.220
companies value diversity they think
it's really important and yet the way

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:19.230
it's really important and yet the way
 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:22.040
it's really important and yet the way
our brain works we still engage in many

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.050
our brain works we still engage in many
 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:24.050
our brain works we still engage in many
different kinds of biases and they

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060
different kinds of biases and they
 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:26.630
different kinds of biases and they
happen outside of our awareness and so

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640
happen outside of our awareness and so
 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:29.240
happen outside of our awareness and so
the more and more that we hear about

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250
the more and more that we hear about
 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:31.490
the more and more that we hear about
this the more and more we talk about it

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500
this the more and more we talk about it
 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.770
this the more and more we talk about it
and have conversations about it the more

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780
and have conversations about it the more
 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:36.049
and have conversations about it the more
it helps us to become just much more

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059
it helps us to become just much more
 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:39.139
it helps us to become just much more
powerful and informed leaders both in

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149
powerful and informed leaders both in
 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:41.209
powerful and informed leaders both in
the national context and also in the

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219
the national context and also in the
 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:43.880
the national context and also in the
international context as well there are

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890
international context as well there are
 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:45.799
international context as well there are
lots of things that we now know about

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809
lots of things that we now know about
 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:47.360
lots of things that we now know about
discrimination that we didn't know

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370
discrimination that we didn't know
 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:51.049
discrimination that we didn't know
before and oftentimes the science is a

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059
before and oftentimes the science is a
 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:53.959
before and oftentimes the science is a
lot more far ahead than what people

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969
lot more far ahead than what people
 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:56.510
lot more far ahead than what people
think and so for example many people

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520
think and so for example many people
 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.910
think and so for example many people
many many people continue to think that

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920
many many people continue to think that
 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.880
many many people continue to think that
discrimination is overt it's intentional

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890
discrimination is overt it's intentional
 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:04.310
discrimination is overt it's intentional
it's the bad apples or bad people

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320
it's the bad apples or bad people
 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.800
it's the bad apples or bad people
engaging in bad behaviors and what we

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810
engaging in bad behaviors and what we
 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:09.800
engaging in bad behaviors and what we
now know is that most discrimination is

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810
now know is that most discrimination is
 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:12.560
now know is that most discrimination is
actually quite unintentional it's

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570
actually quite unintentional it's
 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:14.990
actually quite unintentional it's
unconscious and it happens outside of

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000
unconscious and it happens outside of
 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.719
unconscious and it happens outside of
our awareness and so a great example of

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729
our awareness and so a great example of
 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:20.539
our awareness and so a great example of
this is letters of recommendation so

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549
this is letters of recommendation so
 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:22.700
this is letters of recommendation so
this is a great example because you're

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710
this is a great example because you're
 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:24.440
this is a great example because you're
really trying to write a lot of a

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450
really trying to write a lot of a
 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:26.929
really trying to write a lot of a
recommendation for someone but we know

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939
recommendation for someone but we know
 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:28.999
recommendation for someone but we know
that their one their winds up being very

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009
that their one their winds up being very
 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:31.789
that their one their winds up being very
very strong gender bias ease when you

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799
very strong gender bias ease when you
 

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:33.620
very strong gender bias ease when you
write a letter for a woman versus a

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630
write a letter for a woman versus a
 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:36.230
write a letter for a woman versus a
letter for a man so letters for men are

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240
letter for a man so letters for men are
 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:39.679
letter for a man so letters for men are
longer they use the word brilliant they

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689
longer they use the word brilliant they
 

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:42.230
longer they use the word brilliant they
use the word genius and they focus on

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240
use the word genius and they focus on
 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:45.050
use the word genius and they focus on
the person's qualities letters of

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060
the person's qualities letters of
 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:46.580
the person's qualities letters of
recommendation for women tend to be

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590
recommendation for women tend to be
 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:49.370
recommendation for women tend to be
shorter they use the word team player

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380
shorter they use the word team player
 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:51.710
shorter they use the word team player
and they oftentimes incorporate things

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720
and they oftentimes incorporate things
 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:54.230
and they oftentimes incorporate things
about women's personal lives and so even

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240
about women's personal lives and so even
 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.300
about women's personal lives and so even
when you're really trying hard to

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310
when you're really trying hard to
 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:58.520
when you're really trying hard to
advocate for someone these unconscious

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530
advocate for someone these unconscious
 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:01.399
advocate for someone these unconscious
biases can affect how you're actually

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409
biases can affect how you're actually
 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:03.200
biases can affect how you're actually
advocating for someone when you're

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210
advocating for someone when you're
 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:05.030
advocating for someone when you're
actually on their team and advocating on

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040
actually on their team and advocating on
 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:05.569
actually on their team and advocating on
their behalf

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:05.579
their behalf
 

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:07.999
their behalf
so that's an example of unintentional

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009
so that's an example of unintentional
 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:12.680
so that's an example of unintentional
bias it's very much the case that bias

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690
bias it's very much the case that bias
 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:13.790
bias it's very much the case that bias
also varies by

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800
also varies by
 

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.590
also varies by
group and what I mean by that for

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:15.600
group and what I mean by that for
 

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:18.110
group and what I mean by that for
instance is that discrimination and bias

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:18.120
instance is that discrimination and bias
 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:21.560
instance is that discrimination and bias
against lesbians gay individuals

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:21.570
against lesbians gay individuals
 

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:24.470
against lesbians gay individuals
transgender individuals bisexuals is on

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:24.480
transgender individuals bisexuals is on
 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:26.660
transgender individuals bisexuals is on
the decline it's not completely gone but

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:26.670
the decline it's not completely gone but
 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:28.270
the decline it's not completely gone but
it's certainly on the decline

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:28.280
it's certainly on the decline
 

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:32.000
it's certainly on the decline
however bias against older employees and

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:32.010
however bias against older employees and
 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:33.500
however bias against older employees and
this just means people that are over

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:33.510
this just means people that are over
 

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:34.610
this just means people that are over
fifty years old

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:34.620
fifty years old
 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:36.910
fifty years old
bias against people who are overweight

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:36.920
bias against people who are overweight
 

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:39.620
bias against people who are overweight
and bias against people who have

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:39.630
and bias against people who have
 

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:43.160
and bias against people who have
physical limitations has very much not

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:43.170
physical limitations has very much not
 

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:46.160
physical limitations has very much not
changed over the past say 15 years and

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:46.170
changed over the past say 15 years and
 

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:48.800
changed over the past say 15 years and
in some respects with the inclusion of

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:48.810
in some respects with the inclusion of
 

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:50.390
in some respects with the inclusion of
technology companies it's actually on

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:50.400
technology companies it's actually on
 

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:53.000
technology companies it's actually on
the rise and so we need to be careful to

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:53.010
the rise and so we need to be careful to
 

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:55.160
the rise and so we need to be careful to
think that just because discrimination

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:55.170
think that just because discrimination
 

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:57.350
think that just because discrimination
or bias is declining for some groups

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:57.360
or bias is declining for some groups
 

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:59.120
or bias is declining for some groups
that doesn't decline for all groups at

00:02:59.120 --> 00:02:59.130
that doesn't decline for all groups at
 

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:01.760
that doesn't decline for all groups at
the same time
