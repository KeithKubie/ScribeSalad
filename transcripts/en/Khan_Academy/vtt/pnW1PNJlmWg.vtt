00:00:00.516 --> 00:00:02.092
- [Voiceover] A one litre reaction vessel

00:00:02.092 --> 00:00:05.563
contains 1.2 moles of carbon monoxide,

00:00:05.563 --> 00:00:07.732
1.5 moles of hydrogen gas,

00:00:07.732 --> 00:00:10.688
and 2.0 moles of methanol gas.

00:00:10.688 --> 00:00:13.138
How will the total pressure change

00:00:13.138 --> 00:00:14.866
as the system approaches equilibrium

00:00:14.866 --> 00:00:17.038
at constant temperature?

00:00:17.038 --> 00:00:20.177
So, our carbon monoxide is
reacting with our hydrogen

00:00:20.177 --> 00:00:21.597
in a one to two ratio

00:00:21.597 --> 00:00:23.965
to give us methanol.

00:00:23.965 --> 00:00:26.367
And this reaction is reversible.

00:00:26.367 --> 00:00:29.669
We also know the equilibrium
constant for this reaction

00:00:29.669 --> 00:00:32.336
is 14.5 at some temperature.

00:00:33.452 --> 00:00:37.471
And we know that the
temperature is staying constant.

00:00:37.471 --> 00:00:42.419
So, we are going to break this
problem up into two parts.

00:00:42.419 --> 00:00:44.628
In part one, we're
gonna try to figure out,

00:00:44.628 --> 00:00:46.231
using the reaction quotient,

00:00:46.231 --> 00:00:50.532
whether our system is
at equilibrium or not.

00:00:50.532 --> 00:00:52.829
So, for this reaction,

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:55.408
our reaction quotient 'Q'

00:00:55.408 --> 00:00:57.410
is the product concentration.

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:01.327
"C-H-3-O-H" for methanol.

00:01:02.217 --> 00:01:05.693
Divided by the concentration
of our hydrogen gas;

00:01:05.693 --> 00:01:06.956
to the second power,

00:01:06.956 --> 00:01:10.372
because of that
stoichiometrical efficient.

00:01:10.372 --> 00:01:11.984
And then also in the denominator,

00:01:11.984 --> 00:01:15.484
we have our carbon monoxide concentration.

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:18.144
We can calculate 'Q'

00:01:18.144 --> 00:01:21.000
by plugging in the
concentrations of these,

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.800
at this particular moment in time.

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:25.884
And we can calculate the concentrations

00:01:25.884 --> 00:01:29.490
using the volume of the vessel,

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:30.896
which is one liter

00:01:30.896 --> 00:01:33.285
and the mole quantities.

00:01:33.285 --> 00:01:35.986
We know that concentration

00:01:35.986 --> 00:01:38.678
is just moles divided by volume.

00:01:38.678 --> 00:01:41.249
And since we're dividing
everything by one,

00:01:41.249 --> 00:01:42.782
the initial concentrations

00:01:42.782 --> 00:01:46.139
will be the same as the number of moles.

00:01:46.139 --> 00:01:47.368
So, if we write that out,

00:01:47.368 --> 00:01:49.731
for carbon monoxide,

00:01:49.731 --> 00:01:53.322
the initial concentration is 1.2 molar.

00:01:53.322 --> 00:01:56.872
For hydrogen, it's 1.5 molar.

00:01:56.872 --> 00:01:58.723
And for methanol,

00:01:58.723 --> 00:02:01.640
it is 2.0 molar.

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:05.237
So now we can plug these
concentrations into

00:02:05.237 --> 00:02:08.530
our expression for 'Q'.

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:09.875
And then we get,

00:02:09.875 --> 00:02:12.270
in our numerator, 2.0.

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:16.631
And our denominator, is 1.5

00:02:16.631 --> 00:02:19.156
squared times 1.2.

00:02:19.156 --> 00:02:21.299
So if we plug this all
into our calculators,

00:02:21.299 --> 00:02:23.563
what I got is at our 'Q',

00:02:23.563 --> 00:02:25.438
for this particular moment in time,

00:02:25.438 --> 00:02:29.334
with these concentrations is 0.74.

00:02:29.334 --> 00:02:30.518
So this tells us,

00:02:30.518 --> 00:02:32.825
first of all, we know that 'Q'

00:02:32.825 --> 00:02:35.492
is not equal to 'KC'.

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:40.179
So that means we are not at equilibrium.

00:02:40.179 --> 00:02:43.346
"Not at equilibrium".

00:02:46.414 --> 00:02:48.139
Which means that our pressures

00:02:48.139 --> 00:02:50.029
are indeed going to change

00:02:50.029 --> 00:02:52.928
because the system is going
to try to reach equilibrium.

00:02:52.928 --> 00:02:54.279
The second thing we can do,

00:02:54.279 --> 00:02:55.908
using the reaction quotient to,

00:02:55.908 --> 00:03:00.036
is figure out how the
concentrations will change.

00:03:00.036 --> 00:03:03.161
Now that we know our
reaction quotient 'Q',

00:03:03.161 --> 00:03:04.651
we know that

00:03:04.651 --> 00:03:06.295
our reaction quotient 'QC'

00:03:06.295 --> 00:03:08.295
is less than 'K'.

00:03:09.434 --> 00:03:13.007
We can visualize this on a number line.

00:03:13.007 --> 00:03:16.283
So if we look at all
possible values of 'Q',

00:03:16.283 --> 00:03:18.000
we know that when 'Q' is zero,

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.583
we have all reactants.

00:03:22.805 --> 00:03:26.638
When 'Q' is infinitely large, we have

00:03:27.489 --> 00:03:31.489
all reactants, we have all products.

00:03:34.618 --> 00:03:38.785
And then we have all of the
possible values in between.

00:03:42.275 --> 00:03:43.966
What we're really worried about here,

00:03:43.966 --> 00:03:47.109
is just looking at the
relative value of 'Q' and 'K'.

00:03:47.109 --> 00:03:51.158
And seeing how reaction
concentrations are going to shift.

00:03:51.158 --> 00:03:53.642
So 'Q', we can put on our number line,

00:03:53.642 --> 00:03:55.725
is somewhere around here.

00:03:56.599 --> 00:04:00.399
And 'K' is 14.5, so
we'll say it's somewhere

00:04:00.399 --> 00:04:03.626
around here.

00:04:03.626 --> 00:04:06.876
So this is our 'Q' and this is our 'K'.

00:04:08.271 --> 00:04:12.916
We can see that 'Q' is less
than 'K' on our number line.

00:04:12.916 --> 00:04:14.654
So what's gonna happen is,

00:04:14.654 --> 00:04:16.835
in order to reach equilibrium,

00:04:16.835 --> 00:04:19.888
our concentrations are
going to shift to the right

00:04:19.888 --> 00:04:21.648
to get 'Q' closer to 'K'.

00:04:21.648 --> 00:04:24.906
Which means, what's going to happen is,

00:04:24.906 --> 00:04:25.906
the reaction

00:04:27.448 --> 00:04:29.615
is going to shift to favor

00:04:30.692 --> 00:04:32.442
making more products.

00:04:36.891 --> 00:04:40.223
So if we look back at
the balance reaction,

00:04:40.223 --> 00:04:42.139
what's going to happen here is,

00:04:42.139 --> 00:04:45.639
it's going to shift to favor the products.

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:49.461
So I'm making that top arrow
a little bit more bold.

00:04:49.461 --> 00:04:50.825
And to tie this into

00:04:50.825 --> 00:04:52.464
what the problem wants to know,

00:04:52.464 --> 00:04:54.761
we can figure out how the shift

00:04:54.761 --> 00:04:58.444
to make more products will
affect the total pressure.

00:04:58.444 --> 00:04:59.569
So the total pressure

00:04:59.569 --> 00:05:02.647
for a system that has a
bunch of gas molecules in it,

00:05:02.647 --> 00:05:03.647
we know that

00:05:04.742 --> 00:05:07.075
total pressure is related to

00:05:08.911 --> 00:05:12.276
the moles of gas in the system.

00:05:12.276 --> 00:05:15.872
So since we're shifting
to favor the reactants.

00:05:15.872 --> 00:05:18.339
And on the reactants side, we have,

00:05:18.339 --> 00:05:20.252
we're making one mole of gas.

00:05:20.252 --> 00:05:23.928
And we're starting with
three moles of reactant gas.

00:05:23.928 --> 00:05:27.457
We're favoring the side that
has fewer gas molecules.

00:05:27.457 --> 00:05:31.519
So that means as we shift
to favor the products,

00:05:31.519 --> 00:05:34.356
we're going to reduce number
of gas molecules in the system,

00:05:34.356 --> 00:05:36.936
and that's gonna reduce our 'P' total.

00:05:36.936 --> 00:05:38.213
So the answer is,

00:05:38.213 --> 00:05:41.880
that P total is going to decrease

00:05:43.691 --> 00:05:47.365
as our reaction approaches equilibrium

00:05:47.365 --> 00:05:48.962
and that is because

00:05:48.962 --> 00:05:52.545
our reaction quotient
'Q' is less than 'K'.
