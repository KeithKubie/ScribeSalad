00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:02.346
 Hello everyone, my name is Wojtek Kalicinski. 

00:00:02.346 --> 00:00:04.200
 This is the Android Tool Time for everyone. 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:08.870
 New features in Android Studio 2.3 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:12.150
 Following the full-featured Android Studio 2.2 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:15.390
 We released Android Studio 2.3 to start a new year 

00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:18.750
 The new version has many improvements and fixes existing components 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:21.430
 And bring some exciting new features 

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:22.980
 The first thing I want to mention 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:25.890
 Is the revision of the Instant Run user interface. 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:27.690
 We follow the developerâ€™s advice 

00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:29.280
 Now give you two buttons 

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:31.320
 Run - you will be used to provision and launch the application 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:34.650
 Apply Changes - for any subsequent code 

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:36.510
 Or resource modification 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:39.900
 This uses Instant Run to quickly update a running application 

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:44.040
 Hot plugging, warm plugging and cold plugging now require a device 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.450
 Or run the simulator above Lollipop 

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:49.080
 If you happen to encounter any unexpected problems 

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:50.760
 You can use the Run button again at any time. 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.040
 Force a restart of the application 

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:55.280
 Speaking of speeding up the build time of Android Gradle plug-in 2.3 

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:57.900
 Now we are by default 

00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:00.570
 Enable build cache 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:03.450
 Build the cache is a shared directory on your machine 

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:05.670
 Where is the library extracted and compiled 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:07.930
 And used for all projects 

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:10.980
 Make incremental or full builds faster 

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:13.530
 In this version of Android Studio 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.830
 We are in product synchronization and Gradle integration 

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:17.700
 Also made some general performance improvements 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.250
 And go to Gradle version 3.3 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:24.750
 The ID itself also brings new features to IntelliJ 2016.2 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:26.790
 Such as the new Inspections Tool window 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:29.930
 Maintenance notice, Java editor 

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:32.460
 Bread crumbs, etc. 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:35.310
 The layout editor also has some updates 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:36.990
 In the panel window, now we show 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:40.772
 Widget preview and support sorting and filtering by name 

00:01:40.772 --> 00:01:43.170
 Property Detector on the right 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:45.090
 Now you can add the most commonly used properties 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:49.300
 Go to Favorites to give you quick access to the overview page 

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:51.420
 Finally, the visual editor has a brand new control 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:55.110
 Refined visual effects with constrained layout editing 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:56.970
 Includes brand new icons 

00:01:56.970 --> 00:01:59.840
 An easier way to add a benchmark 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:01.620
 Two major functions that support constraint layout 

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:03.810
 Link and scale 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:05.700
 Use the Android Studio template 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:08.190
 When creating a new project 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:10.199
 The default state now is constraint layout 

00:02:10.199 --> 00:02:13.080
 Go ahead, VectorDrawable import dialog 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:15.720
 There is also a small but demanding upgrade 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:17.850
 Now you can search the Material icon directory by name. 

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:19.980
 This is easy 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:22.020
 Find what you need 

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:25.760
 For raster images we added WebP support in the ID 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:28.950
 WebP is an image compression format which was developed by Google. 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:32.370
 Can be used to replace JPEG or PNG images 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:35.100
 Same quality but smaller file size 

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:38.160
 Now you can convert images directly from the IDE to WebP 

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:40.480
 Just right click on the file or folder 

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:43.380
 Select "Convert to WebP" 

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:46.200
 WebP support varies greatly on different Android versions 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:47.610
 We also added a Lint check 

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:49.410
 View the content of the image 

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:51.950
 If they are not compatible with the min SDK version in the project 

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:54.730
 Will issue a warning 

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:57.366
 Next, we have App Links Assistant 

00:02:57.366 --> 00:02:58.740
 It will guide you 

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:01.470
 Add application link support to your app 

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:03.840
 This includes creating an intent filter for the URL. 

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:06.960
 Modify the activity code to handle these intents 

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:11.460
 And generate a Digital Asset Links document for your website. 

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:15.000
 For the fans of Lint, we also have some new or updated Lint 

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:16.770
 Now we support additional comments 

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:19.620
 Such as restricted and visible tests 

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:21.840
 Lint report, HTML document 

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:25.740
 There are also material design and syntax highlighting 

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:29.010
 Maximum addition is Lint baseline support 

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:32.220
 Enables you to save the currently known Lint error 

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:34.920
 And ignore it for future builds 

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:36.990
 Enable you to process step by step 

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:39.150
 Technical liabilities in the project 

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:41.250
 At the same time, it also has the advantage of 

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:43.140
 Tell you what you might introduce 

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:45.270
 Any new warnings and errors 

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:48.840
 As for SDK Tools, we recently added an SDK manager. 

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:52.350
 A command line interface named SDK Manager 

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:54.630
 You can use it to install or update automatically. 

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:58.920
 SDK components, such as scripts or CI servers 

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:01.320
 The last version of Android Studio 

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:03.420
 Espresso test recorder 

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:06.360
 There are also some improvements, which are now more stable. 

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:08.200
 You can use it to add Espresso UI 

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:10.320
 Test to the application 

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:12.660
 If you have any questions about the new version 

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:15.070
 Or want to get the latest information and tips about Android Studio 

00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:17.579
