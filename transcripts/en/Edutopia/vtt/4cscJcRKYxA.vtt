00:00:08.046 --> 00:00:14.056
&gt;&gt;Pam: The transformation of space has
completely elevated student engagement.

00:00:18.026 --> 00:00:22.796
&gt;&gt;How do we provide the
environments that kids need?

00:00:23.056 --> 00:00:25.106
Sometimes to be in their
caves and be private.

00:00:25.236 --> 00:00:26.966
Sometimes to be at the watering hole,

00:00:26.966 --> 00:00:29.136
and working in small
collaborative groups.

00:00:29.136 --> 00:00:31.826
And sometimes in a cross-pollination
where they're able

00:00:31.826 --> 00:00:34.366
to really share their work
and work with each other.

00:00:37.006 --> 00:00:42.186
&gt;&gt;Katie: My kids love to be under
things, behind things, around things.

00:00:42.396 --> 00:00:45.256
We have five-gallon buckets
in my room that we sit on.

00:00:45.256 --> 00:00:49.986
We sit on crate seating that I
made in my backyard out of a crate

00:00:49.986 --> 00:00:52.156
and some plywood and some foam.

00:00:53.096 --> 00:00:59.836
And I also just threw a lot
of pillows on the floor.

00:00:59.836 --> 00:01:02.416
&gt;&gt;Offspring is like a
baby, like a baby squirrel.

00:01:02.566 --> 00:01:04.536
Is that something that might
be important to your research?

00:01:04.536 --> 00:01:06.156
It might be important.

00:01:06.156 --> 00:01:08.926
&gt;&gt;From Day 1, I've said, "You
may sit anywhere you like as long

00:01:08.926 --> 00:01:10.426
as you're safe in our classroom."

00:01:14.046 --> 00:01:15.336
&gt;&gt;Teacher: That's working
out really well.

00:01:15.536 --> 00:01:16.026
Keep on going.

00:01:17.526 --> 00:01:22.056
&gt;&gt;Becky: We're really looking at how do
we support kids working collaboratively?

00:01:22.056 --> 00:01:26.756
And we can't do it if we're isolated
in rows, and every kid's an island.

00:01:26.946 --> 00:01:32.546
&gt;&gt;Lisa: The first thing that
has to happen is the teacher has

00:01:32.626 --> 00:01:35.846
to have a vision for their
room, and a willingness to say,

00:01:35.846 --> 00:01:37.986
"I'm going to throw out
some of this stuff.

00:01:37.986 --> 00:01:41.686
I don't need this traditional
schooling equipment."

00:01:42.616 --> 00:01:47.406
&gt;&gt;Becky: When you walk into a room
that we have done, you'll see tables.

00:01:47.406 --> 00:01:49.586
You don't see individual
student workspaces.

00:01:50.256 --> 00:01:55.496
In some classrooms, you'll see
at least three kinds of seating.

00:01:57.326 --> 00:02:01.426
You'll see flexible bookshelves
that are mobile that can be moved,

00:02:02.136 --> 00:02:05.236
so that the room can be totally
opened up, or little nooks

00:02:05.236 --> 00:02:06.886
and crannies can be created.

00:02:07.046 --> 00:02:07.706
&gt;&gt;Teacher: What do you
know about soil, Lilly?

00:02:07.706 --> 00:02:09.156
&gt;&gt;Becky: So that everybody
can see everybody,

00:02:09.156 --> 00:02:11.076
and we can participate as a community.

00:02:11.076 --> 00:02:14.806
&gt;&gt;Student: It helps plants grow.

00:02:15.136 --> 00:02:15.226
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Good!

00:02:19.546 --> 00:02:21.076
&gt;&gt;Becky: How can you do it on a dime?

00:02:21.746 --> 00:02:26.616
What we found is teachers are
really hitting the streets the week

00:02:26.716 --> 00:02:30.616
that college kids leave town, and seeing
what they can buy for their classroom.

00:02:31.546 --> 00:02:33.436
&gt;&gt;Cheryl: This is what I'd
like you to accomplish today.

00:02:33.916 --> 00:02:38.636
&gt;&gt;The beginning of the year is a good
time to ask, "If any of you have a couch

00:02:38.946 --> 00:02:43.246
or a chair that you have just sitting
around, the kids would like to read

00:02:43.246 --> 00:02:45.136
on it, and it could be
a Reading Corner."

00:02:45.136 --> 00:02:46.186
And that's how I started.

00:02:46.186 --> 00:02:49.176
And then it grew and grew,
because it was so successful.

00:02:49.366 --> 00:02:50.706
&gt;&gt;Student: Different nooks.

00:02:50.706 --> 00:02:54.636
&gt;&gt;Teacher: And you're good at finding
facts and she's good at typing.

00:02:54.966 --> 00:02:55.106
&gt;&gt;Student: Yeah.

00:02:55.376 --> 00:02:57.486
&gt;&gt;Cheryl: When the students
walk in the room, I'll say,

00:02:57.596 --> 00:02:59.656
"Sit where you work the best.

00:02:59.796 --> 00:03:02.316
&gt;&gt;Justin: When I like get down
into a couch and more comfortable,

00:03:02.316 --> 00:03:04.356
it's almost like it's a bit distracting,

00:03:04.356 --> 00:03:08.396
like it's not exactly the
environment I want to be working in.

00:03:08.396 --> 00:03:13.956
But for the other people, clearly they
have their optimum working environments.

00:03:14.116 --> 00:03:16.416
&gt;&gt;Krishan: Well, Miss
Harris lets us like choose.

00:03:16.626 --> 00:03:21.316
And also since she lets us choose, we
ultimately choose what's best for us.

00:03:21.426 --> 00:03:23.976
We work better together
and individually.

00:03:32.056 --> 00:03:35.056
&gt;&gt;Katie: I've seen the kids
not only be a lot more engaged,

00:03:35.386 --> 00:03:40.156
but they seem happier, they seem more
likely to engage in conversation.

00:03:41.606 --> 00:03:45.506
&gt;&gt;Cheryl: Because the space in this
room has evolved throughout the year,

00:03:45.506 --> 00:03:48.196
the students work has
improved immensely.

00:03:48.756 --> 00:03:50.226
Their grades have improved.

00:03:50.316 --> 00:03:52.176
Just the conversations that they have

00:03:52.176 --> 00:03:55.976
with each other are so
invigorating to hear.
