00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:03.250
Cyberchondria is a real
thing, but do yourself a favor

00:00:03.250 --> 00:00:04.760
and maybe don't Google it.

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:12.870
Hey, guys, this is
Annie from D News.

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:14.900
All of us have done it-- you're
feeling under the weather

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:16.500
and turn to good
old doctor internet

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:17.704
to figure out what ails you.

00:00:17.704 --> 00:00:19.870
Say you have an itch in
your throat, slight fatigue.

00:00:19.870 --> 00:00:22.286
And now that I think about it,
my foot kind of hurts, too.

00:00:22.286 --> 00:00:24.277
And before you know
it, oh, god, I knew it.

00:00:24.277 --> 00:00:25.110
I have fibromyalgia.

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:27.090
No, it's probably cancer.

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:27.730
It's all over.

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:30.540
Searching for symptoms online
is extremely common, so

00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:32.290
common that Google
actually said this year

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:35.440
they can generate accurate
stats on flu outbreaks in the US

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:37.650
based on just search queries.

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:39.310
But that sense of
anxiety you get

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:42.270
from trying to diagnose your
mystery illness on Google, Web

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.560
M.D. or god forbid,
Yahoo Answers,

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:47.120
there's a name for that--
cyberchondria, a term that's

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:48.670
actually been
around for a while.

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:51.980
Back in 2001, the BBC also
called the internet printout

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:52.749
syndrome.

00:00:52.749 --> 00:00:54.790
And the term has been used
in scientific journals

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:56.400
as far back as 2003.

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:59.260
But according to a new study in
the journal Cyber Psychology,

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:02.160
cyberchondria can have
tangible negative effects.

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.099
According to the authors
at Baylor University,

00:01:04.099 --> 00:01:06.295
cyberchondria is a
vicious cycle that

00:01:06.295 --> 00:01:09.080
gets worse the longer you
spend seeking out answers.

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:10.770
It could snowball
into additional fears

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:13.470
about doctor visits,
medical costs, job loss,

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:16.710
that rabbit-hole of stress that
can arise from health concerns.

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:18.290
And people who are
prone to anxiety

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:20.740
can be highly susceptible
to this vicious cycle.

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:22.740
Using anxiety measures,
the researchers

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:24.840
found that, kind of
unsurprisingly, people

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:27.006
who don't tolerate
uncertainty well or worry

00:01:27.006 --> 00:01:28.880
a lot about the future
are the most likely to

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:31.017
spiral into cyberchondria,
all of which

00:01:31.017 --> 00:01:32.600
is compounded by the
fact that there's

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:34.340
a ton of misinformation online.

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:36.790
In another study published
in the Journal of Pediatrics,

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:39.670
researchers looked at search
terms surrounding sudden infant

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:42.950
death syndrome, finding that
of 1,300 websites analyzed,

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:46.857
only 43.5% contained
information in line

00:01:46.857 --> 00:01:48.940
with the recommendations
from the American Academy

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:50.040
of Pediatrics.

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:52.030
So when in doubt, seek
out a real doctor,

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:54.220
and be wary of the
cyberchondira cycle.

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:56.550
Just don't worry
about it too much.

00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:58.290
Hey, I see you've Googling.

00:01:58.290 --> 00:01:58.790
Stop that.

00:01:58.790 --> 00:01:59.990
It's not helping.

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:01.560
Step away from
the search engine.

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:04.070
So do you find yourself freaking
out over medical symptoms

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:04.610
online?
