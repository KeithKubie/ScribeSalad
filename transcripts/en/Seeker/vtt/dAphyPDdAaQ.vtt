00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:02.810
Handedness is a universal human trait.

00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:06.779
Some people prefer the left hand, some the
right, and some are ambidextrous, and can

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:07.779
use both.

00:00:07.779 --> 00:00:15.609
But what about your dog… can it be… left
pawed?

00:00:15.609 --> 00:00:18.480
Hey left-handed mice users, I'm Jules here
for DNews.

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:23.130
Humans handedness is influenced by hundreds
of genes and environmental factors.

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:27.600
That being said, a consistent 10 percent of
the human population is left-hand dominant…

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:29.990
so there's definitely a big genetic component.

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:35.800
A study in PLOS Genetics identified a gene,
PCSK6, which helps determine how the body

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:39.560
organizes itself in early development, and
correlated it with hand-dominance.

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:43.760
But, if handedness is genetic, shouldn't we
see it throughout the rest of the natural

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:44.760
world too?

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:47.760
Well, it is seen in some animals!

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:50.600
Great apes have handedness, for example; it
has been detailed in studies published in

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:53.680
Behavioural Brain Research and Animal Cognition.

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:57.500
Scientists have theorized one of the influencing
factors of hand dominance is rooted in the

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:01.219
language processing part of the brain, but
it could also have been passed down by our

00:01:01.219 --> 00:01:03.969
ancestors, thanks to our use of tools.

00:01:03.969 --> 00:01:08.219
The studies on great apes found they used
different hands for different activities!

00:01:08.219 --> 00:01:12.469
They preferred their right-hand for inanimate
targets like sticks or toys, but for grooming

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:14.840
they didn't report any dominance at all!

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:19.219
Researchers believe this may be due to which
hemisphere of the brain is being used.

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:22.340
Grooming is emotional and social, while grabbing
sticks is purely functional.

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:23.810
This functional preference for hands has been
observed in other primates too!

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:29.029
Seventy percent of chimps are right-handed
for functional tasks like manipulating a tool,

00:01:29.029 --> 00:01:33.249
or hilariously, which hand they choose when
they throw feces at the researchers…

00:01:33.249 --> 00:01:37.359
MRI scans again showed it was probably due
to brain hemispheres!

00:01:37.359 --> 00:01:41.180
Evolutionarily, scientists believe this preference
for one hand may have appeared even before

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:46.079
chimps and humans split from their common
ancestor, as the scans showed similar structures

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:47.289
to our own brains.

00:01:47.289 --> 00:01:51.189
Some enterprising researchers found similar
brain structures toward handedness exist in

00:01:51.189 --> 00:01:54.029
cats, but with a twist: they're sex specific!

00:01:54.029 --> 00:01:58.060
When cats went to play with toys or remove
food from jars, they found females preferred

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:01.119
to use their right-paw, while males went left!

00:02:01.119 --> 00:02:03.209
Cat brains have this weird specialization
too!

00:02:03.209 --> 00:02:06.539
Dogs on the other paw, don't seem to have
this brain specialization.

00:02:06.539 --> 00:02:11.660
A 2006 study in Behavioural Processes found
no population-level preference for a dominant

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:15.310
"hand," but that it might just be split 50-50.

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:17.520
Scientists haven't just studied our fur-babies
though.

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:22.410
Kangaroos were discovered to be hand-specific
(weirdly, most of them are lefties), and frogs

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:25.500
were found prefer their right foot for some
tasks.

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:28.500
Fish prefer one eye to the other when spotting
predators!

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:33.070
And even some birds, like chickens and pigeons,
have brain-level hemisphere specializations

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:34.750
for some visual tasks.

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:39.090
But overall, quadruped animals aren't often
studied for handedness -- one because they

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:43.190
don't have hands, but two, because they're
usually walking on all of their limbs.

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:47.920
That’s obviously a weird thing to think
about, but handedness is kind of weird anyway.

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:52.300
Even though we've identified some genes involved,
geneticists don’t agree on the exact process

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:53.510
of how it happens.

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:56.440
So we don’t really know where it comes from!

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:57.440
It just… is!

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:59.410
And overall, as usual... more research is
needed.

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:00.410
I love that.

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:02.220

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:21.402
To blow your mind even further, animals aren't
the only things scientists have found to have

00:03:21.402 --> 00:03:25.340
left or right "handedness..." molecules and
chemicals can be handed too.

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:27.290
Find out why, here!

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:28.500
And what about your pet?

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:31.250
Do they have a preferred paw or claw or flipper?

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:34.030
