00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Well, four cycles is 2π radians and it has to equal well our angular velocity which is 1 times our time.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
So the answer is 2π, 6.28 seconds.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.000
We call this number the time it takes to complete one full cycle--the period.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:20.000
So if this mass had a period of 6.28 seconds, that would mean if I lifted it up all the way to Xmax

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
and release it, it would take 6.28 seconds for it go all the way down

00:00:24.000 --> 99:59:59.000
and then all the way back up--one full cycle.
