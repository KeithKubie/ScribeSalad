00:00:07.390 --> 00:00:11.040
Disney is such a phenomenally huge media conglomerate
that it essentially has the pick of actors

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:14.750
when it comes to casting them in its movies.
Whether it be a live action movie, an animated

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:17.640
movie, or a hybrid movie featuring a little
bit of both, you'll have seen or heard some

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:21.760
of the biggest stars of all time portraying
or voicing Disney characters.Most of the time,

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:24.810
a big deal is made of it and you can't help
but know which actor was playing a particular

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:28.869
Disney character - everyone knows that Tom
Hanks is Woody in the Toy Story movies and

00:00:28.869 --> 00:00:31.339
spin-off specials, and that Robin Williams
voiced the Genie in two Aladdin movies, for

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:35.040
example - but that's not always the case.Some
big actors' roles in Disney movies actually

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:38.780
go under the radar - and that's what this
video is all about. Here are ten famous actors

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:42.090
you didn't know were in Disney movies.
Miley Cyrus in Bolt

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:44.627
It's easy forget, given how things have turned
out, but long before she was the psycho pop

00:00:44.627 --> 00:00:48.240
bitch from hell, Miley Cyrus was an innocent
and promising young child actress. Having

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:51.969
starred as Hannah Montana in the popular Disney
Channel show of the same name, the acting

00:00:51.969 --> 00:00:56.109
world was her oyster - but did you know she'd
also appeared in a non-Hannah Montana Disney

00:00:56.109 --> 00:01:00.190
movie?Billie Ray's little girl voiced Penny
- the youngster who adopted the titular canine

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:04.860
in 2008's Bolt - a movie in which she worked
alongside Hollywood legends like John Travolta

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:06.670
(who voiced the titular character) and Malcolm
McDowell.

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:10.160
Corey Feldman in The Fox and the Hound
Corey Feldman made his name in the 80s as

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:14.280
a child star, with roles in a plethora of
genuinely iconic movies, including Gremlins,

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:18.549
The Goonies, Stand by Me, The Lost Boys and
The 'Burbs, but his first movie role in that

00:01:18.549 --> 00:01:22.590
decade - and only his second in his career
- was in Disney's 1981 offering The Fox and

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:26.610
the Hound.The movie was about an unlikely
pair of friends in the form of the titular

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:30.210
fox and hound - voiced by Mickey Rooney and
Kurt Russell respectively - but Feldman voiced

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:33.079
the young version of the hound (whose name
is Copper) in early scenes depicting when

00:01:33.079 --> 00:01:37.189
the pair first met.
Demi Moore in The Hunchback of Notre Dame

00:01:37.189 --> 00:01:39.549
The ex-wife of Bruce Willis and Ashton Kutcher,
Demi Moore is best-known for her racy roles

00:01:39.549 --> 00:01:43.750
in movies like Indecent Proposal, Disclosure,
and Striptease, but she's actually also played

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:48.090
a much more innocent and child-friendly voice
role in a classic Disney movie and its sequel.Those

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:52.840
movies were 1996's The Hunchback of Notre
Dame and its aptly-named direct-to-video follow-up;

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:57.310
2002's The Hunchback of Notre Dame II. Moore
played Esmerelda - the beautiful, streetwise

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:00.409
Gypsy dancing girl who befriended the titular
Quasimodo and showed him that his soul was

00:02:00.409 --> 00:02:03.780
truly beautiful, even if his exterior was
not

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:07.210
Melissa McCarthy in The Kid
Now let's move onto the most minor role in

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:11.620
this list, from a movie that most people probably
haven't heard of. It's 2000's The Kid, which

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:15.680
starred Bruce Willis of all people, but a
certain Bridesmaids actress also made an appearance

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:19.620
in one of her earliest and most obscure movie
roles.We're talking about Melissa McCarthy

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:24.140
- the hilarious Academy Award-nominated actress
whose credits now include the likes of Spy

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:28.290
and Ghostbusters - and she played the tiny
role of "Skyway Diner Waitress" long before

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:31.660
she regularly had audiences rolling around
on the floor with laughter.

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:35.879
Oprah Winfrey in The Princess and the Frog
Oprah Winfrey is so strongly-associated with

00:02:35.879 --> 00:02:39.209
her talk-shows and business ventures that
it's easy to forget that she's actually an

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:44.090
extremely talented actress. In fact, as far
back as 1985, Winfrey was nominated for the

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:48.379
Best Supporting Actress Academy Award for
her incredible performance as Sofia Johnson

00:02:48.379 --> 00:02:52.349
in Steven Spielberg's The Color Purple.She
has also voiced a character in a Disney movie

00:02:52.349 --> 00:02:55.710
- 2009's The Princess and the Frog. Winfrey
voiced Eudora - the mother of the main character,

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:59.739
Tiana - in a fairly small role alongside a
star-studded cast that included the likes

00:02:59.739 --> 00:03:02.290
of John Goodman, Terrence Howard and Frank
Welker.

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:06.061
Elijah Wood in The Adventures of Huck Finn
Long before he portrayed the iconic role of

00:03:06.061 --> 00:03:09.150
Frodo Baggins in The Lord of the Rings trilogy
and The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey, Elijah

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:14.379
Wood was a child star who made his movie debut
as "Video-Game Boy #2" in 1989's Back to the

00:03:14.379 --> 00:03:18.349
Future Part II. Four years later, when he
was still in his pre-teen years, he appeared

00:03:18.349 --> 00:03:22.799
as the lead in a little-known Disney movie.It
was 1993's The Adventures of Huck Finn, in

00:03:22.799 --> 00:03:26.490
which Wood played the titular Finn - the star
of Mark Twain's legendary novel. Incidentally,

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:30.400
the movie also featured prominent roles for
the likes of Robbie Coltrane and Ron Perlman,

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:34.730
whom you also may not know were in Disney
movies!

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:38.480
Matthew Broderick in The Lion King
When you think of Simba from 1994's The Lion

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:41.970
King, you generally tend to think about the
young incarnation of the character - who was

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:45.739
voiced by Jonathan Taylor Thomas - and it's
easy to forget that Ferris Bueller himself,

00:03:45.739 --> 00:03:49.370
Matthew Broderick, voiced him as an adult.Another
reason that it's very easy to forget that

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:53.099
fact is because the two sequels in which Simba
was an adult for a larger portion of the movies

00:03:53.099 --> 00:03:57.430
- The Lion King II: Simba's Pride and The
Lion King 1Â½ - were both far less popular

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:03.250
offerings that went straight-to-video upon
their respective releases in 1998 and 2004.

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:06.930
Tony Goldwyn in Tarzan
Although Tony Goldwyn isn't exactly a mega-famous

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:10.480
actor on the level of most individuals on
this list, those of you who are familar with

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:14.120
him certainly won't associate him with the
Disney character he voiced. You may remember

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:18.340
him from his role as the villainous Carl Bruner
in Ghost, or as Colonel Bagley in The Last

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:22.150
Samurai, but what about when he voiced Disney's
Tarzan?No? We didn't think so, but he was

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:26.131
indeed the titular King of the Jungle in 1999's
Tarzan, in which he performed alongside the

00:04:26.131 --> 00:04:30.130
likes of Minnie Driver and Glenn Close. He
didn't voice the character in the two direct-to-video

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:33.850
follow-ups, however.
Joseph Gordon-Levitt in Treasure Planet

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:37.240
Most people know that Joseph Gordon-Levitt
was a child actor and will likely remember

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:41.160
some of his earlier roles in movies like A
River Runs Through It, Angels in the Outfield

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:44.490
and 10 Things I Hate About You, but he's more
well-known for his more recent career and

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:49.220
his roles in movies like Inception, The Dark
Knight Rises and Lincoln - but he had a lead

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:54.330
role in a Disney flop back in 2002 as well.It
was Treasure Planet - a mediocre sci-fi adaptation

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:58.010
of Robert Louis Stevenson's adventure novel
Treasure Island - and he voiced Jim Hawkins;

00:04:58.010 --> 00:05:00.690
the protagonistic teenager who pined for adventure.
You learn something new every day!

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:04.010
Christian Bale in Pocahontas
Christian Bale is now mainly known for his

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:08.110
dark and serious roles, such as Batman in
the Dark Knight Trilogy, Patrick Bateman in

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:12.380
American Psycho, John Connor in Terminator
Salvation, and Trevor Reznik in The Machinist,

00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:16.250
but back before he was a household name, he
had a supporting voice role in a modern Disney

00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:21.630
classic.The movie in question was 1995's Pocahontas,
and a young Bale performed alongside seasoned

00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:25.780
performers like Mel Gibson and Billy Connolly.
He played the part of Thomas - a soldier and

00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:28.190
the loyal friend of the aforementioned Gibson's
John Smith.
