00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:06.270
Each of these stages happens to map very nicely to the Dat C data science track.

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:08.210
What the first stage is concerned with,

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:12.910
you will encounter in the data wrangling class with MongoDB.

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:14.200
The second stage,

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:19.410
is often the domain of what people consider exploratory data analysis.

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:24.880
Which you'll encounter in the data analysis with our class, but other classes

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:29.460
such as modeling, statistics, and machine learning also apply to this stage.

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:33.220
And the last two stages are what we will encounter in this data

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:34.800
visualization class.

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:39.990
Lessons one and two will focus on data visualization theory where you'll

00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:43.460
learn how best to visually represent your data.

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:49.650
And how to sketch or prototype a visualization to arrive at a final design.

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:51.760
And finally, in lessons three and

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:56.240
lesson four we will learn how to construct narratives around your data and

00:00:56.240 --> 00:01:01.540
leverage interaction to create engaging experiences for our audience and reader.

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:06.930
And while this diagram might be biased towards the visualization process,

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:11.490
since Ben Fry got his PhD from the Aesthetics &amp; Computation Group at

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:16.570
MIT's Media Lab, I don't mind since that's what this class will focus on.
