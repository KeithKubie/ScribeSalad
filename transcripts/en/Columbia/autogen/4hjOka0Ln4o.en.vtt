them and so she is working in the

checkpoint she interacted with them
 

01:27:12.350 --> 01:27:14.170 align:start position:0%
checkpoint she interacted with them
sometimes<01:27:12.860><c> so</c><01:27:13.070><c> this</c><01:27:13.250><c> is</c><01:27:13.430><c> what</c><01:27:13.610><c> gave</c><01:27:13.850><c> me</c><01:27:13.880><c> the</c>

sometimes so this is what gave me the
 

01:27:14.180 --> 01:27:14.680 align:start position:0%
sometimes so this is what gave me the
idea

01:27:14.680 --> 01:27:14.690 align:start position:0%
idea
 

01:27:14.690 --> 01:27:17.640 align:start position:0%
idea
so<01:27:15.290><c> my</c><01:27:15.470><c> soldier</c><01:27:16.010><c> his</c><01:27:16.160><c> name</c><01:27:16.370><c> is</c><01:27:16.550><c> Kate</c><01:27:16.820><c> and</c><01:27:17.090><c> I'm</c>

01:27:17.640 --> 01:27:17.650 align:start position:0%
so my soldier his name is Kate and I'm
