00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:05.110
The fastest way to support touch
is to change the UI in respond

00:00:05.110 --> 00:00:07.750
to a DOM elements change in state.

00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:11.295
DOM elements can be in one of
the following states default,

00:00:11.295 --> 00:00:15.690
hover, focus or active.

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:19.080
To change our UI for
each of these states,

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:24.745
we need to apply styles to the following
pseudo classes active, focus and

00:00:24.745 --> 00:00:30.090
hover, as shown here and
here are the results.

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:32.140
On most mobile browsers hover and

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:37.310
focus states will apply to
an element after it's being tapped.

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:40.310
So, consider carefully
what size you set, and

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:44.780
how they will look to the user
after they finish their touch.

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:47.210
Bear in mind that anchor tags and

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:51.200
buttons may have different
behaviors in different browsers.

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:56.740
So assume in some cases the hover will
remain, and in others focus will remain.

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:02.050
Here you could see it in action, when
we're clicking on each of the buttons,

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:04.540
and it's left with a different style.

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:08.560
You could open dev tools and see what
are the pseudo states that we gave for

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:09.880
each of the buttons.

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:14.860
In iOS, in particular, we don't
have an active state by default.

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:17.529
So check the instructor notes for
a shim.
