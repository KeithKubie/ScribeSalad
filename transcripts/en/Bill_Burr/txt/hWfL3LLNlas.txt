Speaker 1:          00:00          No, it's just to remind you, you guys have a haze. Anybody at work, I used to work in this warehouse and we were, we were a bunch of fucking maniacs and all day long, all we did was break balls. Uh, I've told you this shit before because we were basically mentally smart enough to work in a warehouse by the time you went third grade. You know what I mean? It's supposed to be 10 boxes according to the packing list. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10. There you go. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10, 11, 12. Sorry, sesame street, flashback. Um, so we used to fuck around all the time and our manager had no control over us. You know, we didn't respect him. We knew he wasn't gonna win fire. We wasn't going to fire us. He didn't have the goddamn heart. And at the end of the day we got a fucking job done. So he decides that we're, the problem is, is that we're all too fucking young. There's a level of immaturity out there. Cause we were all in our early twenties that we, uh, that he should hire. He hired this 38 year old guy.

Speaker 2:          00:59          Um,

Speaker 1:          01:00          I actually remember his name, but I'm not gonna, I don't name names on this shit. And uh, Jesus Christ, that fucking guy's almost 60. He was like 38 and that was 22 fucking years ago. He's 60.

Speaker 1:          01:13          What the fuck? So anyways, this guy drove a fucking sky blue Chevy cavalier stationwagon four door bare bones factory fucking rims. The car was like three years old. He had 8,000 miles on it. Alright. And this guy was a Weirdo and he had these fucking glasses, these black framed glasses that nobody wore in the 80s. So we immediately started calling him warty we'd be, hey woody, how many boxes we get over there? And this guy was just bizarre. And he'd come over, why call me woody? Are you trying to bring me down? So he kept saying, you're trying to bring me down. Did I already tell this fucking story? This sounds oddly familiar to me. So we would just fuck with them. We would just be like, okay, at four 31 today, everybody just start going, what do you, what do you, what are you, what are you in? That's what we would do. He would be picking orders down in the, in the warehouse area and we would all be picking orders with them. And then out of nowhere we would just start,

Speaker 3:          02:17          God, what do you, what do you, what do you, what do you, what do you, what do you, what do you, what do you, what are you

Speaker 1:          02:20          top of our fucking lungs? I know it's fucking am as sophomores, but it would and what, we wouldn't say it to him.

Speaker 2:          02:28          Okay.

Speaker 1:          02:29          We would just fucking be sitting. It was really passive aggressive cause he already talked to management about us calling them woody. So it's like, dude, we're not calling you woody. We're just going woody, woody, woody, woody, woody, look in your vicinity. So we do the same thing. You're trying to bring me down. You're trying to beat me down. So eventually we haze this guy so much that he fucking quit, right? He and his little Chevy Cavalier fucking four door sky blue bear bone station wagon drove right out. And the back of my head I was like, you know what, I've got a bad feeling. That mother coming back, it was right right around the time when people first started going postal. So it wasn't enough that that we actually drove this guy out of work. What are they fucking maniacs I worked with somehow got the guy's home phone number and the following week he still didn't have a job and he picked up the phone. He's like, hello. And there was 10 of us standing around the phone, right?

Speaker 4:          03:21          We all go, where do you, what do you, what do you, what do you want?

Speaker 5:          03:25          Okay.

Speaker 1:          03:25          And I always pictured, I'm slamming the phone down and then looking up like that dude in a clockwork work orange when he realizes the dude who came and fucking kicked the shit out of him and raped his wife came back. Um, that's kind of an ugly story, isn't it?

Speaker 5:          03:41          Okay.

Speaker 1:          03:41          You know, for, you know, for as much as people sit there and they talk about this cyber bullying and all this type of shit and how fucking horrible it is, which it is obviously, uh, you know, I don't like how everybody tries to act like they were a victim. Well, I mean, weren't you a little bit of both? Cause I know I used to get bullied. Jesus Christ walking up the street looking like fucking that kid on the, uh, the f family Griffith. What the fuck is that?

Speaker 1:          04:11          The honey Andy Griffith. How did I come up with the family Griffith? Ah, my fucking brain is mush. MMM. Yeah. People, you immediately came walking up the street. My fucking mind. My hair was orange when I was growing up. The guy didn't get the shit kicked out of me, you know, but then, you know, I got a little bit bigger. I got a couple more freckles. I got got some more confidence and I just started picking on kids who were a younger than I was. So now whenever I see those goddamn stories, um, I just, I dunno, I, I see both sides of it. I just see like, yeah, you shouldn't have fucking done that, but I don't judge the bully cause I did shit like that. No, you guys didn't do shit like that. Go Fuck Yourself. All right. Why don't you guys, do you know what? That's the theme of this whole podcast. Every can go fuck themselves.
