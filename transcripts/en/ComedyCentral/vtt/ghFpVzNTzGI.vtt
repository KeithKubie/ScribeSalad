Yes, the rumors are true

I know we all want him back,

00:00:12.779 --> 00:00:14.747
but we still have
a handful of leads,

00:00:14.747 --> 00:00:18.084 align:start size:88% position:13%

we are treating
blogs as news now

00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:33.132
so they are allowed in
the pressroom, go ahead.

00:00:33.132 --> 00:00:34.634
- Yeah, would you
say that this case

00:00:34.634 --> 00:00:36.569
is something only kids from
the 90's would understand?

00:00:39.038 --> 00:00:40.206
