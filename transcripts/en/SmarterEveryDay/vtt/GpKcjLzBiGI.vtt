Hey it's me Destin. Welcome back to Smarter Every Day. The cat is disturbing

00:00:12.050 --> 00:00:16.090
homework time so we're gonna take a break and make an intro. So every time I've observed

00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:20.130
a butterfly flying across a field he looks like he's a very poor flyer. He looks like he's bouncing

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:24.150
along and, because of the really large surface area on the wing and low mass it looks

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:28.200
like the wind's just making him flutter back and forth, like he doesn't really have control over what he's doing.

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:32.230
But it wasn't until I recorded this next video with a Miro at 2000 frames per second

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:36.270
in the Amazon that I realized that I've probably been wrong this entire time.

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:40.310
Alright, let's see if we can high speed.. What is this called? This butterfly?

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:42.350

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:52.420
(Destin) Yep. I got it

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.450
Is it going?

00:00:54.470 --> 00:01:00.490

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:36.760
It stayed in focus.
- Oh my god.

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:40.810
- Gee that was amazing.

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:44.820
Alright let's take this opportunity to change battery since this one's low.

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:52.920
Tristan you want some water?
- [unintelligible]
- Course you are. You don't need water do you.
