00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:03.541
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; The answer is, this intersection. I solved this by guessing that there was a

00:00:03.541 --> 00:00:07.223
pattern to these street names. Which would mean that this is 3rd Avenue. And

00:00:07.223 --> 00:00:11.027
this is 5th Street. I know this is 3rd Avenue, because, well, because it's

00:00:11.027 --> 00:00:15.074
between 2nd and 4th Avenue. And this must be 5th Street, because it comes after

00:00:15.074 --> 00:00:18.523
4th Street. So, if I follow Third Avenue to Fifth Street. I get the

00:00:18.523 --> 00:00:22.736
intersection. Now, this is pretty powerful. Using only two numbers, and in this

00:00:22.736 --> 00:00:26.579
case, the street and the avenue, it's possible to figure out exactly what

00:00:26.579 --> 00:00:29.121
intersection I was talking about. Pretty cool.
