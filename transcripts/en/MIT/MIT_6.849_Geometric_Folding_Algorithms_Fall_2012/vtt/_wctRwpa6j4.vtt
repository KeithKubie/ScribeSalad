00:00:02.835 --> 00:00:03.710
PROFESSOR: All right.

00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:07.070
So today we resume
efficient origami design.

00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:09.860
And we had our guest
lecture from Jason Ku

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:12.050
which was definitely a
different style of lecture.

00:00:12.050 --> 00:00:14.600
More survey, lots of
different artwork.

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:18.110
And it had some practical
hands-on experience

00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:20.010
with TreeMaker, which
you're welcome to do

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:22.980
more of on your problem set.

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:24.990
And so there weren't
a lot of questions

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:28.810
because this is not a
very technical lecture,

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:30.620
so I thought I'd
show you some more

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:35.730
examples of artistic origami,
things not covered by Jason,

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:38.700
and some other different
types of origami.

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:42.787
So we start with a
bunch of models by Jason

00:00:42.787 --> 00:00:44.370
because he didn't
show his own models,

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:45.411
so I thought it'd be fun.

00:00:45.411 --> 00:00:47.130
We've seen a bunch
already in this class,

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:52.250
but this is a really nice
F16 that he designed.

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:56.200
And these are all done with
Tree method of origami design.

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:57.050
Another lobster.

00:00:57.050 --> 00:00:58.670
We saw a Robert
Lang's lobster before.

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:02.060
This one's different.

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:05.069
This is a version of
the crab that he showed.

00:01:05.069 --> 00:01:08.740
So the one you saw was like the
very preliminary, very rough

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:10.140
folding.

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.859
But with some
refinement, especially

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:14.650
in the shaping stage,
it looks pretty nice.

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:19.600
Even on the back side you
get some nice features.

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:22.010
We have a little rabbit.

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:24.860
This is kind of in
the traditional style

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:30.120
that he showed where you've
got sharp crease lines that

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:32.400
really define the form.

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:35.550
I assume that's what
he was going for here.

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:37.700
This is a non-tree
method design.

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:41.590
This is using what's
called box pleating.

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:42.890
We've heard about box pleating.

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:45.150
And it means you have
horizontal, vertical,

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:47.720
and 45 degree diagonal folds.

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:52.320
But you can use it just
to shape box-like shapes.

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:56.950
It originally was used by
Moser to make a train out

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:58.270
of one rectangle of paper.

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:02.960
But here we've got a pretty
nice sports car convertible,

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:04.290
even with a color reversal.

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:05.340
So it's pretty cool.

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:11.870
This is one of my favorite
designs of Jason's.

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:15.370
Bicycle, one square
paper, color reversal.

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:18.970
Really thin features.

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:22.650
Probably lots of layers up
there, but pretty awesome.

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:25.420
This is using tree method.

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:28.046
Obviously, the paper is
not connected with a hole

00:02:28.046 --> 00:02:29.670
there, so there's
some part here that's

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:32.760
attached just by
folding to another part.

00:02:35.774 --> 00:02:36.440
Yeah, questions?

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:38.434
AUDIENCE: How big is that?

00:02:38.434 --> 00:02:39.850
PROFESSOR: I'm
trying to remember.

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:42.150
I think the bicycle's
about that big.

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:44.210
Anyone remember?

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:46.730
It's been a while.

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:48.630
So presuming he started
from a piece of paper

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:50.110
maybe twice the size or so.

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:56.500
Looks big here.

00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:00.850
And this is a really complicated
butterfly, very exact features,

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:02.819
very cool.

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:05.360
These are all from his website
if you want to check out that.

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:06.900
I'm just giving a selection.

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:08.380
Some of them have
crease patterns

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:10.630
and you can very clearly
see the different parts

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:13.560
of the model, and the
rivers, and so on.

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:16.350
Others do not.

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:18.940
This is one of-- we're
going back in time, so this

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:21.800
is when Jason was just starting
at MIT as an undergrad,

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:23.220
I believe.

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:27.750
This is the dog of someone who
works at the admissions office.

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:30.010
It's very cool.

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:32.910
And this is one of his
earliest models, 2004.

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:36.120
I think it's pretty
elegant on the ice

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:39.390
skate with color reversal.

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:43.020
So that was Jason, for fun.

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:46.530
One question we had
is what about origami

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:48.440
from other materials,
not just paper?

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:50.580
And we've seen a few
examples of that,

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:52.510
but I thought it'd
be a fun theme.

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:56.760
And we'll come back to
this a couple times today.

00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:59.220
This is-- I don't if you
call dollar bills paper--

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:01.700
but there is this whole
style of dollar bill origami,

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:04.690
as my t-shirt last
class indicated.

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:09.380
And this is one of the more
famous dollar bill folders.

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:12.270
And he has hundreds and
hundreds of designs.

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:17.690
One of his latest is the alien
face hugger for Prometheus

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:18.190
and so on.

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:21.690
So there's a ton of stuff done.

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:23.290
There's the
particular proportion

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:26.210
of the rectangle
of a dollar bill.

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:28.760
And it's also just
plentily available.

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:30.770
The US is one of the
cheapest currencies

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:34.000
to do bill folding because it
has one of the lowest value

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:34.500
bills.

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:39.010
So there's that.

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:42.330
These are all folded
from toilet paper rolls,

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:44.900
so moving up to cardboard.

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:47.170
This definitely is pretty
different in the way

00:04:47.170 --> 00:04:49.560
it acts relative
to standard paper.

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:53.080
And there's this guy who
makes these incredible masks.

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:53.910
Very impressive.

00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:59.790
And I'm guessing crayon or
some kind of rubbed color.

00:04:59.790 --> 00:05:03.400
So that's pretty awesome.

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:05.220
Here's something
called Hydro-Fold.

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:11.260
This just came out this year
by this guy Christophe Guberan,

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:12.720
where he's got an
inkjet printer.

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:15.100
He's filled it with a
particular kind of ink

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:16.520
that he custom makes.

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:19.820
And as it comes out of the
printer, it folds itself.

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:21.400
It's been printed on both sides.

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:24.140
So one side you get mountains,
the other side you get also

00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:27.020
mountains, but relative
to that, it's valleys.

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:32.192
So there's some
fun thing happening

00:05:32.192 --> 00:05:35.990
as the liquid dries out that
causes the paper to curve.

00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:37.760
You can't get 180
degree folds, but you

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:41.060
can get some pretty
nice creases.

00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:44.890
I don't know exactly how
much accelerated that is,

00:05:44.890 --> 00:05:49.290
but he's hopefully
visiting MIT later on

00:05:49.290 --> 00:05:51.700
and we'll find out more.

00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:55.535
So it's using regular paper,
but a different folding style,

00:05:55.535 --> 00:05:57.790
a different material
for folding.

00:05:57.790 --> 00:06:00.874
You can also take casts
of existing paper models.

00:06:00.874 --> 00:06:02.540
So Robert Lang has
done a bunch of these

00:06:02.540 --> 00:06:07.620
with a guy named Kevin Box
where they take a paper model

00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:09.460
and cast or partially cast it.

00:06:09.460 --> 00:06:11.080
In this case, in bronze.

00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:14.420
In these cases, stainless steel.

00:06:14.420 --> 00:06:15.270
So these are two.

00:06:15.270 --> 00:06:18.010
This is like traditional
origami crane and Robert Lang

00:06:18.010 --> 00:06:20.560
complex crane.

00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:24.850
And for fun, the crease pattern
for those two looks like this.

00:06:24.850 --> 00:06:31.730
And this is I think mostly
on a 22.5 degree grid system.

00:06:31.730 --> 00:06:35.890
May actually be--
you can see here

00:06:35.890 --> 00:06:37.850
there's a river
that's not orthogonal.

00:06:37.850 --> 00:06:40.420
So it's not intended
to be box pleated.

00:06:40.420 --> 00:06:43.620
So that gives you
these 22.5 degrees.

00:06:43.620 --> 00:06:46.100
There's some other features
out here, but the most of it

00:06:46.100 --> 00:06:51.080
is this 22.5 degree system.

00:06:51.080 --> 00:06:53.020
So as you might guess
from now, there's

00:06:53.020 --> 00:06:54.610
some questions about this.

00:06:54.610 --> 00:06:58.080
You don't necessarily
entirely use the tree method.

00:06:58.080 --> 00:06:59.590
You use a mix of
different things.

00:06:59.590 --> 00:07:01.006
In particular,
there's a technique

00:07:01.006 --> 00:07:03.190
called grafting where you
can combine two models.

00:07:03.190 --> 00:07:04.814
If you're interested
in that, check out

00:07:04.814 --> 00:07:05.981
Origami Design Secrets.

00:07:05.981 --> 00:07:07.480
And for things like
the dragon where

00:07:07.480 --> 00:07:10.510
you have this textured
pattern-- which we'll get to,

00:07:10.510 --> 00:07:12.210
it's called a
tessellation-- and you

00:07:12.210 --> 00:07:14.810
want to combine that with
doing tree method stuff,

00:07:14.810 --> 00:07:15.850
you can do that.

00:07:15.850 --> 00:07:18.490
But it's not necessarily
mathematical formal

00:07:18.490 --> 00:07:19.340
how to do that.

00:07:19.340 --> 00:07:22.391
It's just people figure
it out by trial and error.

00:07:22.391 --> 00:07:24.140
There's probably
interesting open problems

00:07:24.140 --> 00:07:26.757
there, haven't been formalized.

00:07:26.757 --> 00:07:28.090
Here's another cardboard design.

00:07:28.090 --> 00:07:30.180
This is by our friend
Tomohiro Tachi.

00:07:30.180 --> 00:07:31.830
That's him.

00:07:31.830 --> 00:07:34.060
So this was initially a bed.

00:07:34.060 --> 00:07:35.620
And you fold it up.

00:07:35.620 --> 00:07:37.550
And you need a
pillow, of course.

00:07:37.550 --> 00:07:39.620
It turns into a chair.

00:07:39.620 --> 00:07:40.720
So that's pretty awesome.

00:07:40.720 --> 00:07:42.440
So that's one of
the great things

00:07:42.440 --> 00:07:46.991
about using non-paper is you get
a lot more structural integrity

00:07:46.991 --> 00:07:47.490
and support.

00:07:50.120 --> 00:07:52.300
And that leads us
into steel, which

00:07:52.300 --> 00:07:54.270
also makes for stronger models.

00:07:54.270 --> 00:07:56.730
And this is another
design by Tomohiro.

00:07:56.730 --> 00:08:01.300
We made it here at MIT using
a waterjet cutter in CSAIL.

00:08:01.300 --> 00:08:04.120
And it makes a
pretty nice table.

00:08:04.120 --> 00:08:08.110
This is based on a curve crease
design which initially drafted

00:08:08.110 --> 00:08:11.170
on paper, and then in plastic.

00:08:11.170 --> 00:08:14.850
And then when it seemed
to be working pretty well,

00:08:14.850 --> 00:08:20.840
we waterjet cut this steel
and these perforation lines.

00:08:20.840 --> 00:08:25.840
And then many hours of painful
bending or difficult bending

00:08:25.840 --> 00:08:29.050
later, some hamming
and so on, we

00:08:29.050 --> 00:08:33.669
got it to fold into
a pretty nice shape.

00:08:33.669 --> 00:08:36.080
So that's one example.

00:08:36.080 --> 00:08:37.940
I have another example.

00:08:37.940 --> 00:08:39.840
This is out of
much thinner steel.

00:08:39.840 --> 00:08:44.210
And this happens to be laser
cut using a newer laser

00:08:44.210 --> 00:08:48.040
cutter in the Center for Bits
and Atoms in the Media Lab

00:08:48.040 --> 00:08:50.840
building.

00:08:50.840 --> 00:08:52.010
So a little bit of a cheat.

00:08:52.010 --> 00:08:54.220
This is not from a square paper.

00:08:54.220 --> 00:08:57.515
It's been cut a
little bit smaller.

00:08:57.515 --> 00:08:59.550
I need chalk.

00:08:59.550 --> 00:09:00.050
Jason.

00:09:04.700 --> 00:09:08.050
So take a square of paper.

00:09:08.050 --> 00:09:11.750
You can cut out-- these
are 22.5 degree angles.

00:09:11.750 --> 00:09:16.570
You can cut out material
like this from your square

00:09:16.570 --> 00:09:19.550
and still make a good crane.

00:09:19.550 --> 00:09:21.390
But it substantially
reduces the number

00:09:21.390 --> 00:09:23.430
of layers you get,
especially at the corners.

00:09:23.430 --> 00:09:29.166
And so we exploited that because
this is pretty thick material.

00:09:29.166 --> 00:09:32.420
And this is just the Center
for Bits and Atoms logo.

00:09:32.420 --> 00:09:33.980
But pretty cool.

00:09:33.980 --> 00:09:35.770
You can make a crane.

00:09:35.770 --> 00:09:39.000
And we added these
crease lines to get

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:41.340
the nice bow of the crane.

00:09:41.340 --> 00:09:42.000
So pretty nice.

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:51.070
This is made by Kenny Cheung
who just graduated, PhD.

00:09:51.070 --> 00:09:53.600
So that was some metal.

00:09:53.600 --> 00:09:55.460
Next topic is tessellations.

00:09:55.460 --> 00:09:57.820
So this is a particular
style of origami.

00:09:57.820 --> 00:10:00.130
It goes back-- probably
the earliest tessellation

00:10:00.130 --> 00:10:02.260
folder is Ron Resch.

00:10:02.260 --> 00:10:05.470
The early history's a little
hard to know for sure.

00:10:05.470 --> 00:10:08.250
Ron Resch was an artist
starting in the '60s.

00:10:08.250 --> 00:10:12.350
He died just a few years ago.

00:10:12.350 --> 00:10:14.390
We've met him.

00:10:14.390 --> 00:10:15.920
Pretty crazy guy.

00:10:15.920 --> 00:10:18.800
Did a lot of cool origami
foldings early in the day.

00:10:18.800 --> 00:10:22.160
There's a patent that describes
this particular folding.

00:10:22.160 --> 00:10:25.400
And what makes a
tessellation is essentially

00:10:25.400 --> 00:10:27.200
a repeated pattern of some sort.

00:10:27.200 --> 00:10:28.310
It could be periodic.

00:10:28.310 --> 00:10:30.547
It could be aperiodic.

00:10:30.547 --> 00:10:32.130
You've probably heard
of tessellations

00:10:32.130 --> 00:10:37.680
like the square grid or some
kind of mesh of two dimensions.

00:10:37.680 --> 00:10:40.050
Origami tessellations
are in some sense

00:10:40.050 --> 00:10:42.070
trying to represent
such a tessellation.

00:10:42.070 --> 00:10:44.365
Here you've got the
triangular grid,

00:10:44.365 --> 00:10:48.477
if you look closely,
after folding.

00:10:48.477 --> 00:10:50.560
But also if you look at
the crease pattern itself,

00:10:50.560 --> 00:10:51.820
it is a tessellation.

00:10:51.820 --> 00:10:54.040
It's going to be a repeated
pattern of polygons.

00:10:54.040 --> 00:10:57.670
So you've got sort of two
levels of tessellation going on.

00:10:57.670 --> 00:11:01.170
It's like a double
rainbow or something.

00:11:01.170 --> 00:11:02.920
And so there are lots
of examples of this.

00:11:02.920 --> 00:11:08.090
Here's some kind of traditional
flat origami tessellations.

00:11:08.090 --> 00:11:10.240
Some of these are more
traditional than others.

00:11:10.240 --> 00:11:14.330
You've some very simple--
well not simple, but beautiful

00:11:14.330 --> 00:11:16.970
repeating patterns.

00:11:16.970 --> 00:11:18.510
Octagons and squares here.

00:11:21.739 --> 00:11:22.530
You can count them.

00:11:25.250 --> 00:11:27.000
And this is still periodic.

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:30.650
Then we get to some
less periodic stuff.

00:11:30.650 --> 00:11:34.290
And so there are
techniques for designing

00:11:34.290 --> 00:11:35.570
these kinds of tessellation.

00:11:35.570 --> 00:11:37.680
If you start with a
regular 2D tessellation,

00:11:37.680 --> 00:11:40.000
there's a transformation
from that tessellation

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:42.620
into a crease pattern, which
then makes things like this.

00:11:42.620 --> 00:11:46.120
You can see here there's
sort of clear edges here.

00:11:46.120 --> 00:11:49.400
And that represents the
tessellation it's based on.

00:11:49.400 --> 00:11:51.310
It's just been kind of
shrunk a little bit.

00:11:51.310 --> 00:11:52.580
Each of these is a pleat.

00:11:52.580 --> 00:11:54.990
There's a mountain
and a valley crease.

00:11:54.990 --> 00:11:58.500
And so on all of these,
I believe, that style.

00:11:58.500 --> 00:12:02.800
You've got essentially a twist
fold at each of the vertices.

00:12:02.800 --> 00:12:07.122
And you've got a pleat
along each of the edges.

00:12:07.122 --> 00:12:08.580
And if you want to
play with these,

00:12:08.580 --> 00:12:12.700
there's software called Tess
freely available online.

00:12:12.700 --> 00:12:14.210
And I'll show it to you.

00:12:14.210 --> 00:12:19.760
And it lets you design
things like this,

00:12:19.760 --> 00:12:22.430
following a
particular algorithm.

00:12:22.430 --> 00:12:24.280
So you start with some geometry.

00:12:24.280 --> 00:12:27.190
And I don't really
know these by heart.

00:12:27.190 --> 00:12:29.605
So it has a fixed
set of geometries

00:12:29.605 --> 00:12:31.580
that you can play with.

00:12:31.580 --> 00:12:34.020
We'll try this one.

00:12:34.020 --> 00:12:40.300
And you get a regular 2D
tessellation of polygons.

00:12:40.300 --> 00:12:46.585
And then you increase the--
then I hit, Show Creases.

00:12:49.850 --> 00:12:51.670
And it's applying a
particular algorithm

00:12:51.670 --> 00:12:54.430
which is essentially-- it's
maybe more dramatic if I

00:12:54.430 --> 00:12:58.230
increase this value or
change it dynamically.

00:12:58.230 --> 00:13:02.410
It's rotating each of the
polygons, so a twisting.

00:13:02.410 --> 00:13:04.710
Sorry, that's negative.

00:13:04.710 --> 00:13:09.100
As it rotates them, you
get-- let me know you.

00:13:09.100 --> 00:13:11.280
It'd be nice if this is
color-coded, but it's not.

00:13:11.280 --> 00:13:13.650
So these two squares
are two original squares

00:13:13.650 --> 00:13:14.900
of the tessellation.

00:13:14.900 --> 00:13:16.120
They've been twisted.

00:13:16.120 --> 00:13:18.350
And then these edges
which used to be--

00:13:18.350 --> 00:13:20.690
so they're shrunk and twisted.

00:13:20.690 --> 00:13:22.820
And then these edges
used to be attached.

00:13:22.820 --> 00:13:26.870
We're now going to put in a
little parallelogram there.

00:13:26.870 --> 00:13:28.492
And you just do that everywhere.

00:13:28.492 --> 00:13:29.700
And this is a crease pattern.

00:13:29.700 --> 00:13:31.140
It will fold flat.

00:13:31.140 --> 00:13:32.640
Doesn't work for
all tessellation.

00:13:32.640 --> 00:13:34.070
And there's a paper
characterizing

00:13:34.070 --> 00:13:35.445
which tessellations
it works for.

00:13:35.445 --> 00:13:37.210
They're called spider webs.

00:13:37.210 --> 00:13:38.940
But it's a very simple
algorithm and it's

00:13:38.940 --> 00:13:41.360
led to tons of tessellations
over the years.

00:13:41.360 --> 00:13:46.050
And you can export this to
PDF, print it out, and fold it.

00:13:46.050 --> 00:13:47.620
It obviously takes
a little while.

00:13:47.620 --> 00:13:50.660
One of the fun surprises
of this algorithm, which

00:13:50.660 --> 00:13:52.320
this is made by Alex
Bateman and this

00:13:52.320 --> 00:13:54.440
was just sort of a
surprise by accident.

00:13:54.440 --> 00:13:57.920
I think there's a slider at the
top, the pleat angle slider.

00:13:57.920 --> 00:14:02.350
And by accident, he didn't
require it to be positive.

00:14:02.350 --> 00:14:05.350
And he realized that if you
made it negative-- whoa, that's

00:14:05.350 --> 00:14:11.120
a little too negative-- you
actually get the folded state.

00:14:11.120 --> 00:14:13.730
This is what that
crease pattern will

00:14:13.730 --> 00:14:16.380
look like after you fold it
flat, because it's essentially

00:14:16.380 --> 00:14:19.100
reflecting across each crease.

00:14:19.100 --> 00:14:21.950
So this is with all
the layers stacked up.

00:14:21.950 --> 00:14:23.900
So you get sort
of an x-ray view.

00:14:23.900 --> 00:14:25.660
But it gives you
a sense of-- it's

00:14:25.660 --> 00:14:28.020
hard to see the thickness
here so we actually wrote

00:14:28.020 --> 00:14:33.040
a little thing here which
is a little bit slow--

00:14:33.040 --> 00:14:36.211
we'll see if it works--
called Light Pattern.

00:14:36.211 --> 00:14:38.460
And it's just measuring how
many layers are stacked up

00:14:38.460 --> 00:14:41.250
at each point and
it will hopefully

00:14:41.250 --> 00:14:44.180
give you a shaded pattern
so that if you held it up

00:14:44.180 --> 00:14:46.891
to light where the dark
spot's going to be,

00:14:46.891 --> 00:14:48.390
where the bright
spot's going to be.

00:14:48.390 --> 00:14:50.400
So the idea is this
will help you figure out

00:14:50.400 --> 00:14:52.984
whether something's going to be
interesting or not interesting

00:14:52.984 --> 00:14:53.775
ahead of have time.

00:14:53.775 --> 00:14:56.290
Then you can go fold once you've
set the parameters exactly

00:14:56.290 --> 00:14:57.290
like you like.

00:14:57.290 --> 00:14:59.230
I've just shown one of
the parameters there.

00:14:59.230 --> 00:15:02.770
There's another
one, pleat ratio.

00:15:02.770 --> 00:15:03.620
So this is cool.

00:15:03.620 --> 00:15:06.120
I think an interesting project
would be to extend this tool.

00:15:06.120 --> 00:15:08.090
It's open source.

00:15:08.090 --> 00:15:09.960
Lots of interesting
things to do with it.

00:15:09.960 --> 00:15:11.190
Add more tessellations.

00:15:11.190 --> 00:15:13.750
Improve the interface.

00:15:13.750 --> 00:15:17.130
Maybe try to show 3D
visualization as it folds.

00:15:17.130 --> 00:15:19.460
There are existing
3D origami tools

00:15:19.460 --> 00:15:21.770
which we'll see in the very
next lecture, Rigid Origami

00:15:21.770 --> 00:15:25.130
Simulator, that might make
that not too hard actually.

00:15:25.130 --> 00:15:28.202
It'd be cool to try.

00:15:28.202 --> 00:15:30.160
Put it on the web I think
would be interesting.

00:15:30.160 --> 00:15:32.111
Point it to JavaScript
or something.

00:15:32.111 --> 00:15:34.360
Because I think there's
really cool tessellation here.

00:15:34.360 --> 00:15:37.610
Not many people have
actually used the software

00:15:37.610 --> 00:15:41.910
because it's a little
awkward and as you can see,

00:15:41.910 --> 00:15:43.380
Light pattern
doesn't always work.

00:15:43.380 --> 00:15:45.504
But I think that's just
because this tessellation's

00:15:45.504 --> 00:15:47.491
a little too big.

00:15:47.491 --> 00:15:47.990
All right.

00:15:47.990 --> 00:15:50.330
So that was Tess.

00:15:50.330 --> 00:15:52.150
And that style of tessellation.

00:15:52.150 --> 00:15:54.233
You can see that you could
some really cool thing.

00:15:54.233 --> 00:15:56.640
This is what a light
pattern looks like.

00:15:56.640 --> 00:16:00.430
So you get the different
shades of gray.

00:16:00.430 --> 00:16:01.310
50 shades of gray?

00:16:04.640 --> 00:16:06.890
Then there are more three
dimensional tessellations.

00:16:06.890 --> 00:16:10.430
So this is in a different style.

00:16:10.430 --> 00:16:15.380
And this is folding
a very simple origami

00:16:15.380 --> 00:16:17.730
base called water bomb.

00:16:17.730 --> 00:16:21.300
And the resulting
thing is not flat,

00:16:21.300 --> 00:16:23.080
but it's very simple
crease pattern

00:16:23.080 --> 00:16:24.890
and pretty cool three
dimensional result.

00:16:24.890 --> 00:16:26.190
This is not captured by Tess.

00:16:26.190 --> 00:16:27.981
And that would be a
different style project

00:16:27.981 --> 00:16:30.585
to generalize to
3D tessellations.

00:16:30.585 --> 00:16:32.400
That'd be very cool.

00:16:32.400 --> 00:16:38.350
Here's that same tessellation,
I think, or a very similar one,

00:16:38.350 --> 00:16:41.090
but made out of stainless steel.

00:16:41.090 --> 00:16:44.180
So you can see
there's big cuts here.

00:16:44.180 --> 00:16:47.030
So this is probably made
on a waterjet cutter.

00:16:47.030 --> 00:16:49.630
And then you leave little tabs.

00:16:49.630 --> 00:16:52.910
So you wear gloves so you
can fold this by hand.

00:16:52.910 --> 00:16:57.320
Probably not easy, but possible.

00:16:57.320 --> 00:17:01.149
Here's some more back to paper,
some more 3D tessellations.

00:17:01.149 --> 00:17:03.440
And if you're interested in
playing with tessellations,

00:17:03.440 --> 00:17:04.619
you could try Tess.

00:17:04.619 --> 00:17:08.160
Or there's this really
good book came out recently

00:17:08.160 --> 00:17:11.040
by Eric Gjerde,
Origami Tessellations.

00:17:11.040 --> 00:17:13.160
And this is actually
one of the models

00:17:13.160 --> 00:17:16.140
that's described in here.

00:17:16.140 --> 00:17:19.250
Unlike traditional origami,
there's no sequence of steps.

00:17:19.250 --> 00:17:21.930
All of these are based on
here's a crease pattern,

00:17:21.930 --> 00:17:23.560
fold along all the
lines, and then

00:17:23.560 --> 00:17:26.480
collapse all the
lines simultaneously.

00:17:26.480 --> 00:17:28.339
Like a lot of mathematical
origami design,

00:17:28.339 --> 00:17:30.684
but there's great stuff in here.

00:17:30.684 --> 00:17:32.100
Really cool
tessellations and some

00:17:32.100 --> 00:17:34.950
of the best photographs
of tessellations.

00:17:34.950 --> 00:17:36.580
So definitely
check out that book

00:17:36.580 --> 00:17:39.780
if you want to do tessellations.

00:17:39.780 --> 00:17:41.180
This is the crease pattern.

00:17:41.180 --> 00:17:43.750
Give you an idea for this guy.

00:17:46.440 --> 00:17:48.600
It's also periodic.

00:17:48.600 --> 00:17:50.425
This is triangular twists.

00:17:50.425 --> 00:17:56.860
You can kind of recognize
that, but it's very cool.

00:17:56.860 --> 00:17:58.220
More alternate materials.

00:17:58.220 --> 00:17:59.920
This is polypropylene.

00:17:59.920 --> 00:18:02.060
And there's this
great Flickr site,

00:18:02.060 --> 00:18:04.200
polyscene by Polly Verity.

00:18:04.200 --> 00:18:08.130
And tons of examples of
foldings by polypropylene.

00:18:08.130 --> 00:18:10.050
So it's a kind of plastic.

00:18:10.050 --> 00:18:16.870
It gets scored by a machine
and then folded by hand.

00:18:16.870 --> 00:18:18.265
And so really striking results.

00:18:18.265 --> 00:18:19.765
You get this nice
semi-transparency.

00:18:19.765 --> 00:18:21.431
It works really well
with tessellations.

00:18:24.500 --> 00:18:28.090
Here's some recent ones we
just found making things out

00:18:28.090 --> 00:18:35.100
of mirror and plywood and copper
as like the surface material,

00:18:35.100 --> 00:18:39.810
and then polyester and fabric,
or polyester and Tyvek.

00:18:39.810 --> 00:18:42.260
Tyvek is like those
envelopes, plasticy envelopes

00:18:42.260 --> 00:18:45.340
that you can't really
stretch or tear.

00:18:45.340 --> 00:18:46.410
Really great stuff.

00:18:46.410 --> 00:18:48.906
And you can buy it in sheets.

00:18:48.906 --> 00:18:50.530
So that's sort of
the base layer that's

00:18:50.530 --> 00:18:51.830
holding everything together.

00:18:51.830 --> 00:18:56.850
At the creases here, you can see
through to the fabric material.

00:18:56.850 --> 00:18:59.720
And then this is
plywood on the surface.

00:18:59.720 --> 00:19:01.684
So these are all
different tessellations,

00:19:01.684 --> 00:19:02.600
kind of tessellations.

00:19:02.600 --> 00:19:06.530
These have been wrapped
around to make vessels

00:19:06.530 --> 00:19:10.000
or to make-- they call
it a shoulder cape.

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:12.000
Looks like a set of armor.

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:16.650
But really cool stuff when
you work with other materials.

00:19:16.650 --> 00:19:18.630
It'd be a great project
in this class, I think,

00:19:18.630 --> 00:19:20.990
to try some of these techniques.

00:19:20.990 --> 00:19:24.764
Combining some basic
foldable sheet material

00:19:24.764 --> 00:19:26.180
with some richer
material, you can

00:19:26.180 --> 00:19:28.549
make some really cool stuff.

00:19:28.549 --> 00:19:30.090
Once you have a
computer model of it,

00:19:30.090 --> 00:19:33.749
you can-- and we'll
see in the next lecture

00:19:33.749 --> 00:19:36.040
different computer tools for
doing that-- then actually

00:19:36.040 --> 00:19:38.010
building them I think
is really striking.

00:19:41.560 --> 00:19:44.160
Back to paper, although this
barely looks like paper.

00:19:44.160 --> 00:19:47.130
These are some really cool
kind of traditional style

00:19:47.130 --> 00:19:49.740
tessellations, but folded in a
very unusual and beautiful way

00:19:49.740 --> 00:19:54.826
by Joel Cooper who's one
of the leading tessellation

00:19:54.826 --> 00:19:55.950
folders in a certain sense.

00:19:55.950 --> 00:19:58.200
He's best known for
tessellations like this,

00:19:58.200 --> 00:19:59.230
however.

00:19:59.230 --> 00:20:01.770
So these are all based
on a regular triangular

00:20:01.770 --> 00:20:05.540
grid, but not quite identical.

00:20:05.540 --> 00:20:07.850
It's definitely
not periodic here.

00:20:07.850 --> 00:20:10.230
Going for human forms.

00:20:10.230 --> 00:20:12.460
He has whole busts and heads.

00:20:12.460 --> 00:20:15.097
And these are really striking.

00:20:15.097 --> 00:20:17.180
They're not designed
particularly algorithmically.

00:20:17.180 --> 00:20:20.310
My understanding is he
comes up with little gadgets

00:20:20.310 --> 00:20:23.480
for certain features
like cheeks and so on,

00:20:23.480 --> 00:20:26.880
and he starts composing them
in ways that seem to work.

00:20:26.880 --> 00:20:29.230
And he has a collection
of different pieces

00:20:29.230 --> 00:20:30.610
that work together well.

00:20:30.610 --> 00:20:33.140
And he can get really
intricate, really beautiful

00:20:33.140 --> 00:20:36.760
3D surfaces out of that.

00:20:36.760 --> 00:20:39.430
So this is kind of begging
to be studied mathematically

00:20:39.430 --> 00:20:41.180
in some way, but
pretty challenging.

00:20:46.500 --> 00:20:49.850
This is an interesting
tessellation style

00:20:49.850 --> 00:20:51.370
by Goran Konjevod.

00:20:51.370 --> 00:20:54.540
He was a co-author on the
"Folding a Better Checkerboard"

00:20:54.540 --> 00:20:57.150
paper that I talked about.

00:20:57.150 --> 00:20:59.470
And the crease pattern
here is extremely boring.

00:20:59.470 --> 00:21:02.034
It's a square grid.

00:21:02.034 --> 00:21:03.450
But the mountain
valley assignment

00:21:03.450 --> 00:21:04.560
is not quite trivial.

00:21:04.560 --> 00:21:07.600
And because of the
thickness of the material,

00:21:07.600 --> 00:21:10.320
it actually gets this
curving behavior.

00:21:10.320 --> 00:21:15.060
So this thing is technically,
mathematically it's flat.

00:21:15.060 --> 00:21:18.390
It's like this really
boring pleated square.

00:21:18.390 --> 00:21:21.717
But the way it goes is
you sort of take a square

00:21:21.717 --> 00:21:23.800
and you pleat the edge and
then you pleat the edge

00:21:23.800 --> 00:21:24.758
and you pleat the edge.

00:21:24.758 --> 00:21:26.740
So you do mountain
valley, mountain valley.

00:21:26.740 --> 00:21:29.714
And here you're alternating
between this side and this side

00:21:29.714 --> 00:21:30.880
and this side and this side.

00:21:30.880 --> 00:21:33.150
And that gives you
this kind of corner.

00:21:33.150 --> 00:21:35.470
But because the material
is nonzero thickness,

00:21:35.470 --> 00:21:37.000
you get these
really cool curves.

00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:39.830
And when you change which
order you fold the pleats in,

00:21:39.830 --> 00:21:41.810
you can really control
a lot of this surface.

00:21:41.810 --> 00:21:42.800
It's kind of magical.

00:21:42.800 --> 00:21:44.300
He has a bunch of
designs like this.

00:21:44.300 --> 00:21:50.520
You can check out his images on
the web if you want to see more

00:21:50.520 --> 00:21:53.400
and diagrams.

00:21:53.400 --> 00:21:55.570
And I think this is our
last tessellation example.

00:21:55.570 --> 00:21:58.570
So here, goal is
to make US flag.

00:21:58.570 --> 00:22:00.250
And there's a video
of this being made,

00:22:00.250 --> 00:22:02.495
but it's just fold along
the lines and then collapse.

00:22:05.062 --> 00:22:06.520
You're using a
tessellation element

00:22:06.520 --> 00:22:09.082
to get the stars in the flag.

00:22:09.082 --> 00:22:11.040
And this is what the
crease pattern looks like.

00:22:11.040 --> 00:22:12.415
So you've got a
nice tessellation

00:22:12.415 --> 00:22:15.350
here and then sort of a
simpler tessellation out here,

00:22:15.350 --> 00:22:16.980
which is just some pleats.

00:22:16.980 --> 00:22:20.390
And getting those pleats
to resolve to the outside.

00:22:20.390 --> 00:22:22.180
This is by Robert Lang.

00:22:22.180 --> 00:22:22.680
Very cool.

00:22:25.910 --> 00:22:31.310
So next, I want to transition
to kind of modular origami

00:22:31.310 --> 00:22:32.930
where you use multiple parts.

00:22:32.930 --> 00:22:37.750
But before we get there, this
is I guess the oldest recorded

00:22:37.750 --> 00:22:41.590
example of a picture of origami.

00:22:41.590 --> 00:22:44.440
So this is from 1734.

00:22:44.440 --> 00:22:46.050
This is a reference.

00:22:46.050 --> 00:22:50.440
This is the actual object-- I
believe, a newspaper article.

00:22:50.440 --> 00:22:52.300
And it's a little
rough to see here,

00:22:52.300 --> 00:22:54.920
but there's an origami
crane and a bunch

00:22:54.920 --> 00:22:59.000
of other classic origami
things like water bomb.

00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:02.260
So the assumption is by
1734, origami was well-known.

00:23:02.260 --> 00:23:04.322
All the classic
models were out there.

00:23:04.322 --> 00:23:05.780
We don't know how
far back it goes.

00:23:05.780 --> 00:23:07.196
It could be as
early as when paper

00:23:07.196 --> 00:23:09.770
was invented which
was like 50 AD.

00:23:09.770 --> 00:23:14.280
Somewhere between 50 and 1734,
origami really hit it big.

00:23:14.280 --> 00:23:16.110
That's the big range.

00:23:16.110 --> 00:23:18.230
But I wanted to show this
because of the cranes.

00:23:18.230 --> 00:23:22.350
And one way to combine
multiple parts together

00:23:22.350 --> 00:23:25.140
is to combine multiple
cranes together.

00:23:25.140 --> 00:23:31.280
And there's this whole
world, hiden senbazuru,

00:23:31.280 --> 00:23:33.350
which is connected cranes.

00:23:33.350 --> 00:23:37.770
And orikata means you're
cutting in addition to folding.

00:23:37.770 --> 00:23:39.880
So this is a rectangle of paper.

00:23:39.880 --> 00:23:42.530
It's been split along
two lines and then folded

00:23:42.530 --> 00:23:44.850
into three cranes.

00:23:44.850 --> 00:23:47.680
So that's pretty cool.

00:23:47.680 --> 00:23:50.740
And there's much
more intricate ones

00:23:50.740 --> 00:23:53.590
where you take a square of
paper or a rectangle paper,

00:23:53.590 --> 00:23:57.090
do lots of cuts, subdivide your
thing into a bunch of squares.

00:23:57.090 --> 00:23:59.100
Each square gets
folded into a crane.

00:23:59.100 --> 00:24:02.939
The tips of the cranes stay
connected at these tabs.

00:24:02.939 --> 00:24:04.730
And the challenge when
you're folding these

00:24:04.730 --> 00:24:06.510
is to not tear at the tabs.

00:24:06.510 --> 00:24:08.720
But then you'll get
these really cool folds.

00:24:08.720 --> 00:24:11.310
This is an old book from
1797, not much later

00:24:11.310 --> 00:24:12.779
than that last reference.

00:24:12.779 --> 00:24:14.320
We have a copy of
this book if you're

00:24:14.320 --> 00:24:15.730
interested in checking it out.

00:24:15.730 --> 00:24:18.070
Lots of different designs.

00:24:18.070 --> 00:24:22.280
There have been some recent
works in making really nice.

00:24:22.280 --> 00:24:25.690
These are spheres out
of connected cranes

00:24:25.690 --> 00:24:26.810
by Linda Tomoko.

00:24:29.600 --> 00:24:32.950
And here's one out
of silver foil.

00:24:32.950 --> 00:24:38.897
So really cool connected cranes.

00:24:38.897 --> 00:24:40.480
So that's a traditional
origami style.

00:24:40.480 --> 00:24:42.720
I want to transition
to modular origami

00:24:42.720 --> 00:24:45.270
where you combine lots
of identical parts,

00:24:45.270 --> 00:24:47.600
but now they're
actually disconnected.

00:24:47.600 --> 00:24:52.250
And this is a very simple unit.

00:24:52.250 --> 00:24:53.830
I think it's just
water bomb based.

00:24:53.830 --> 00:24:55.510
And then they nest
into each other.

00:24:55.510 --> 00:25:00.730
You've probably seen these
kind of swans, modular swans.

00:25:00.730 --> 00:25:02.670
I think they're a
very old tradition.

00:25:02.670 --> 00:25:03.570
Possibly China?

00:25:03.570 --> 00:25:06.570
I'm not sure exactly.

00:25:06.570 --> 00:25:08.160
So a kind of traditional model.

00:25:08.160 --> 00:25:11.530
But you get a lot of
geometric models like this.

00:25:11.530 --> 00:25:13.750
So these are examples
of different units.

00:25:13.750 --> 00:25:15.830
You take typically
a square of paper.

00:25:15.830 --> 00:25:20.320
You do maybe 10 or 20
folds and you get a unit.

00:25:20.320 --> 00:25:22.710
And then you combine a bunch
of these units together.

00:25:22.710 --> 00:25:25.660
So one of the classic units
is called a Sonobe unit.

00:25:25.660 --> 00:25:27.410
Sonobe units use
sort of backwards,

00:25:27.410 --> 00:25:31.540
but you can get these
kinds of cool polyhedra.

00:25:31.540 --> 00:25:37.100
Robert Neale, he's a magician
and an origami designer.

00:25:37.100 --> 00:25:37.866
Has some units.

00:25:37.866 --> 00:25:39.490
This one's called
the penultimate unit.

00:25:39.490 --> 00:25:43.750
And so you can see each of
these green strips is one unit--

00:25:43.750 --> 00:25:45.160
blue strip, pink strip.

00:25:45.160 --> 00:25:46.760
There's a lot of units in here.

00:25:46.760 --> 00:25:48.220
90 in total.

00:25:48.220 --> 00:25:50.860
Typically, one per edge of
the polyhedron, sometimes

00:25:50.860 --> 00:25:52.720
two per edge.

00:25:52.720 --> 00:25:55.270
And they lock together
in certain ways

00:25:55.270 --> 00:25:59.030
to really hold these
nice shapes here.

00:25:59.030 --> 00:26:01.850
Tom Hull folds a lot
of modular origami.

00:26:01.850 --> 00:26:06.050
And one of his units
is called a PHiZZ unit.

00:26:06.050 --> 00:26:08.110
I think it can make
anything as long as you

00:26:08.110 --> 00:26:11.300
have three units coming
together at each vertex.

00:26:11.300 --> 00:26:13.440
So as long as every
vertex has degree three,

00:26:13.440 --> 00:26:15.160
you can kind of make
your polyhedron.

00:26:15.160 --> 00:26:17.326
I guess the lengths also
have to be the same or else

00:26:17.326 --> 00:26:19.351
you have to adjust the
units to be different.

00:26:19.351 --> 00:26:20.975
So each of the units
here is identical,

00:26:20.975 --> 00:26:22.470
except different color patterns.

00:26:25.870 --> 00:26:28.450
Here's a big example of a
PHiZZ unit construction.

00:26:28.450 --> 00:26:30.810
So this is 270 units.

00:26:30.810 --> 00:26:34.770
Take a long time to fold
probably and even more time

00:26:34.770 --> 00:26:37.164
to weave them together.

00:26:37.164 --> 00:26:39.205
Usually putting the last
piece in is the hardest.

00:26:42.190 --> 00:26:44.080
Here's some more
examples by Tom Hull.

00:26:44.080 --> 00:26:47.200
He has another unit
called the hybrid unit.

00:26:47.200 --> 00:26:50.860
And this is what three of
them look like woven together.

00:26:50.860 --> 00:26:54.800
So this paper is probably red
on one side, black on the other.

00:26:54.800 --> 00:26:57.900
And there's one unit that
comes here, wraps around

00:26:57.900 --> 00:27:00.599
the tetrahedron, and two more.

00:27:00.599 --> 00:27:02.140
And you combine them
and you can make

00:27:02.140 --> 00:27:05.000
all these different
regular solids.

00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:08.800
And you get these
spiky tetrahedra

00:27:08.800 --> 00:27:10.890
on each of the faces
which is pretty cool.

00:27:10.890 --> 00:27:13.200
So this like icosahedra,
a regular 20-sided

00:27:13.200 --> 00:27:15.610
die, on the inside here,
but then each of them

00:27:15.610 --> 00:27:18.750
has a spike from there.

00:27:18.750 --> 00:27:20.710
And here's a big one he made.

00:27:20.710 --> 00:27:22.690
This is actually one of
my favorite polyhedra,

00:27:22.690 --> 00:27:24.956
the rhombicosidodecahedron.

00:27:24.956 --> 00:27:30.425
It's got all the polygons--
squares, triangles, hexagons,

00:27:30.425 --> 00:27:33.390
if I recall correctly.

00:27:33.390 --> 00:27:35.221
It's obvious, right?

00:27:35.221 --> 00:27:37.720
And one of the challenges here
is getting the color patterns

00:27:37.720 --> 00:27:40.730
to be nice and
symmetric and even.

00:27:40.730 --> 00:27:43.710
And Tom Hull is one of
the experts in that.

00:27:43.710 --> 00:27:46.989
He's a mathematician,
but also an origamist.

00:27:46.989 --> 00:27:48.530
And then he started
combining the two

00:27:48.530 --> 00:27:49.830
because of problems like this.

00:27:53.650 --> 00:27:55.650
Next we get to polypolyhedra.

00:27:55.650 --> 00:27:58.320
This is the idea of
taking multiple polyhedra

00:27:58.320 --> 00:28:00.360
and weaving them
together and then making

00:28:00.360 --> 00:28:01.800
that out of origami.

00:28:01.800 --> 00:28:03.950
And this is one of the
most famous designs

00:28:03.950 --> 00:28:07.280
in this family called FIT, or
Five Intersecting Tetrahedra,

00:28:07.280 --> 00:28:08.470
designed by Tom Hull.

00:28:08.470 --> 00:28:12.030
This is a photograph of one
that I am the proud owner.

00:28:12.030 --> 00:28:15.410
It was folded by
Vanessa Gould, who

00:28:15.410 --> 00:28:18.250
directed Between the Folds,
which is the documentary you

00:28:18.250 --> 00:28:21.440
all heard about when
Jason mentioned it.

00:28:21.440 --> 00:28:23.850
And it's available free
streaming on Netflix,

00:28:23.850 --> 00:28:26.280
so you should all watch it.

00:28:26.280 --> 00:28:27.820
Or we could have a showing here.

00:28:27.820 --> 00:28:29.690
Actually, how many
people are interested?

00:28:29.690 --> 00:28:32.910
Haven't seen the movie or
would like to see it again

00:28:32.910 --> 00:28:35.361
related to this
class some evening?

00:28:35.361 --> 00:28:35.860
OK.

00:28:35.860 --> 00:28:39.030
That's maybe enough
to do a showing.

00:28:39.030 --> 00:28:40.530
Anyway, she folded this.

00:28:44.360 --> 00:28:45.240
Cool.

00:28:45.240 --> 00:28:50.440
And then Robert Lang enumerated
all possible polypolyhedra

00:28:50.440 --> 00:28:52.447
that are symmetric
in a certain sense.

00:28:52.447 --> 00:28:54.780
And these are two examples
that he thought were so cool.

00:28:54.780 --> 00:28:56.110
He made them out of paper.

00:28:56.110 --> 00:28:58.600
Most of them just exist
as virtual designs.

00:28:58.600 --> 00:29:01.130
People have been folding
them, but there's

00:29:01.130 --> 00:29:03.154
hundreds if not
thousands in his list.

00:29:03.154 --> 00:29:04.570
So if you're
interested, check out

00:29:04.570 --> 00:29:06.110
his website on polypolyhedra.

00:29:09.010 --> 00:29:11.070
These are, again, modular.

00:29:11.070 --> 00:29:14.010
And finally, we come
to modules of cubes.

00:29:14.010 --> 00:29:16.180
And this is why you
have business cards.

00:29:16.180 --> 00:29:18.980
And I thought we
could play with this.

00:29:18.980 --> 00:29:23.540
This is a life-size chair made
from a particular unit, which

00:29:23.540 --> 00:29:26.680
is out of business cards,
folding these individual cubes

00:29:26.680 --> 00:29:29.260
and then sticking them
together in a particular way.

00:29:29.260 --> 00:29:31.500
Unfortunately, the
material's not strong enough

00:29:31.500 --> 00:29:33.200
to actually support much weight.

00:29:33.200 --> 00:29:35.920
So you can't sit on this
chair, but it looks just

00:29:35.920 --> 00:29:36.830
like a real chair.

00:29:36.830 --> 00:29:38.710
It's very cool.

00:29:38.710 --> 00:29:41.870
You can make any set of cues
you like and interlock them

00:29:41.870 --> 00:29:43.310
together.

00:29:43.310 --> 00:29:47.500
One of the craziest
experimenters with this cube

00:29:47.500 --> 00:29:49.980
module is Jeannine
Mosely, who's a MIT

00:29:49.980 --> 00:29:52.310
alum and lives in the area.

00:29:52.310 --> 00:29:56.430
And she became really famous for
making this Menger Sponge out

00:29:56.430 --> 00:29:58.190
of 66,000 business cards.

00:29:58.190 --> 00:30:01.580
It took something like
five years to make this.

00:30:01.580 --> 00:30:04.270
She made a lot of
the units herself.

00:30:04.270 --> 00:30:07.830
And so this is trying to
represent a particular fractal,

00:30:07.830 --> 00:30:08.820
which is pretty cool.

00:30:08.820 --> 00:30:11.750
You start by taking a cube
and then drilling holes

00:30:11.750 --> 00:30:15.270
through each of the sides
in the center third.

00:30:15.270 --> 00:30:16.410
So this is one iteration.

00:30:16.410 --> 00:30:18.455
You just drill
through that hole,

00:30:18.455 --> 00:30:20.940
that hole, same on each side.

00:30:20.940 --> 00:30:22.730
Remove that material.

00:30:22.730 --> 00:30:25.960
That leaves you
with-- how many cubes?

00:30:25.960 --> 00:30:27.150
Eight cubes on top.

00:30:27.150 --> 00:30:28.233
Eight cubes on the bottom.

00:30:28.233 --> 00:30:32.790
Four cubes in the
middle, which is 20.

00:30:32.790 --> 00:30:34.784
For each of the 20
cubes, you recurse.

00:30:34.784 --> 00:30:36.200
So for each of
those 20 cubes, you

00:30:36.200 --> 00:30:39.520
drill holes, drill holes
from all the sides.

00:30:39.520 --> 00:30:42.790
And after two iterations,
you have this structure.

00:30:42.790 --> 00:30:45.410
After three iterations,
you have this structure.

00:30:45.410 --> 00:30:47.699
After infinitely
many iterations--

00:30:47.699 --> 00:30:48.990
well, no, this is not infinite.

00:30:48.990 --> 00:30:53.520
But this is actually the same
number of iterations as that.

00:30:53.520 --> 00:30:54.870
So in principle, you keep going.

00:30:54.870 --> 00:30:58.680
But at any fixed point, you can
treat the smallest little unit

00:30:58.680 --> 00:31:01.110
that hasn't been recursed
as one of these cubes,

00:31:01.110 --> 00:31:03.310
build that, and then
assemble them together.

00:31:03.310 --> 00:31:04.590
It's challenging.

00:31:04.590 --> 00:31:06.751
You could not take this--
with the business cards,

00:31:06.751 --> 00:31:08.250
you could not go
to the next level--

00:31:08.250 --> 00:31:09.666
not because it
would take forever,

00:31:09.666 --> 00:31:12.130
but also because it would
collapse under its own weight.

00:31:12.130 --> 00:31:14.270
So trade-off there.

00:31:14.270 --> 00:31:16.440
That was 66,000 business
cards, five years.

00:31:16.440 --> 00:31:19.100
I thought, man, that
was a big project.

00:31:19.100 --> 00:31:22.380
But then Jeannine says,
what else can we make?

00:31:22.380 --> 00:31:25.410
And she got more volunteers
for these future projects

00:31:25.410 --> 00:31:27.210
so they were made a lot faster.

00:31:27.210 --> 00:31:28.540
This is a cool fractal.

00:31:28.540 --> 00:31:34.290
Not quite as many,
50,000 business cards.

00:31:34.290 --> 00:31:36.399
And this is a fractal
that she designed.

00:31:36.399 --> 00:31:37.315
Kind of complimentary.

00:31:37.315 --> 00:31:41.830
You take a cube and subdivide
it into three by three by three,

00:31:41.830 --> 00:31:45.210
and then remove all the corner
cubes, and then recurse.

00:31:45.210 --> 00:31:46.970
And she calls it the
Moseley Snowflake

00:31:46.970 --> 00:31:49.700
because if you look
at it from the corner,

00:31:49.700 --> 00:31:54.000
you get this nice Koch
snowflake outline.

00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:57.056
And this is the real
one from the same view.

00:31:57.056 --> 00:32:00.660
It's a little big, so it's
hard to see it all in one shot.

00:32:00.660 --> 00:32:03.510
And so that's pretty awesome.

00:32:03.510 --> 00:32:06.800
And then her most recent project
was 100,000 business cards.

00:32:06.800 --> 00:32:09.130
This is I guess the
world record for origami

00:32:09.130 --> 00:32:11.220
made from business cards.

00:32:11.220 --> 00:32:13.140
And this is a model
of Union Station

00:32:13.140 --> 00:32:17.372
in Worcester, Massachusetts.

00:32:17.372 --> 00:32:19.080
Hundreds of volunteers
here to make this.

00:32:19.080 --> 00:32:23.640
This was done for first night
celebration a year or so ago.

00:32:23.640 --> 00:32:25.130
Pretty amazing.

00:32:25.130 --> 00:32:28.160
And you can see, you can really
sculpt with these cube units,

00:32:28.160 --> 00:32:29.090
do lots of cool stuff.

00:32:29.090 --> 00:32:34.930
And there's a few extra
details on the surface there.

00:32:34.930 --> 00:32:37.772
So I thought we
would make something.

00:32:37.772 --> 00:32:39.790
So these are diagrams
you can start working

00:32:39.790 --> 00:32:43.190
or I can tell you
about how they work.

00:32:43.190 --> 00:32:47.240
Each cube is made from six
identical business cards.

00:32:47.240 --> 00:32:49.340
I have here my
own business cards

00:32:49.340 --> 00:32:53.280
from when I first
arrived, old classic.

00:32:53.280 --> 00:32:55.900
So you start by taking two
of your business cards.

00:32:55.900 --> 00:32:58.610
You have to decide whether
you want the white face up

00:32:58.610 --> 00:33:00.540
on your cube and make
it nice and clean

00:33:00.540 --> 00:33:04.120
or you want the pattern side up.

00:33:04.120 --> 00:33:05.740
Whichever one you
want to expose,

00:33:05.740 --> 00:33:08.570
you keep that on the outside
and you bring the two cards

00:33:08.570 --> 00:33:09.410
together.

00:33:09.410 --> 00:33:13.420
So in this case, I'm going
to make the pattern side out.

00:33:13.420 --> 00:33:16.230
And you want to align
these approximately evenly.

00:33:16.230 --> 00:33:20.420
You want them as perpendicular
as possible and then

00:33:20.420 --> 00:33:22.780
roughly evenly spaced.

00:33:22.780 --> 00:33:27.190
And then you just
mountain fold both sides.

00:33:27.190 --> 00:33:31.855
So you want mountain folds on
the side that you care about.

00:33:31.855 --> 00:33:33.230
And that gives
you a nice square.

00:33:33.230 --> 00:33:36.870
Now I've got two nice
squares folded like this.

00:33:36.870 --> 00:33:39.605
Repeat three times,
you get six units.

00:33:56.080 --> 00:34:12.520
Four and six.

00:34:12.520 --> 00:34:14.760
OK, once you've
got the six units,

00:34:14.760 --> 00:34:16.510
you want to combine
them together.

00:34:16.510 --> 00:34:18.409
This is where it gets fun.

00:34:18.409 --> 00:34:21.409
And it's helpful to look
at this diagram down here.

00:34:21.409 --> 00:34:23.254
These are some diagrams
by Ned Batchelder.

00:34:26.650 --> 00:34:29.710
And so this idea of making
cubes has been around.

00:34:29.710 --> 00:34:33.020
I think it was Jeannine's
idea to combine them together.

00:34:33.020 --> 00:34:35.730
So this is what one
cube looks like.

00:34:35.730 --> 00:34:38.130
Why don't I fold,
make one of them.

00:34:38.130 --> 00:34:40.969
Basically, you want the
tabs going on the outside.

00:34:40.969 --> 00:34:44.270
And you need to alternate
so they lock together.

00:34:44.270 --> 00:34:46.350
And you need to alternate
between oriented

00:34:46.350 --> 00:34:49.219
horizontal and
oriented vertical.

00:34:49.219 --> 00:34:54.350
So they recommend starting by
making a corner, three of them

00:34:54.350 --> 00:34:58.935
like that, and then
fill around the outside.

00:35:08.090 --> 00:35:11.710
And then as usual, putting in
the last piece is the hardest.

00:35:11.710 --> 00:35:14.350
So I've got to get--
I want all the tabs

00:35:14.350 --> 00:35:16.710
on the outside like that.

00:35:21.120 --> 00:35:23.060
And I probably
should've mentioned--

00:35:23.060 --> 00:35:26.000
fold the creases really hard.

00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:28.860
You can do that to a certain
extent afterwards, make it nice

00:35:28.860 --> 00:35:31.260
and cubey.

00:35:31.260 --> 00:35:35.090
But in this case, I got
my six-sided cube out

00:35:35.090 --> 00:35:35.920
of those six units.

00:35:35.920 --> 00:35:38.840
It's got my name
right in the center.

00:35:38.840 --> 00:35:42.360
So you can design business card
specifically for this purpose.

00:35:42.360 --> 00:35:43.670
I accidentally did.

00:35:43.670 --> 00:35:45.960
And that's how
you make one cube.

00:35:45.960 --> 00:35:49.600
Once you've got two cubes,
you can lock them together

00:35:49.600 --> 00:35:53.180
by just twisting them 90
degrees relative to each other

00:35:53.180 --> 00:35:56.810
and just sliding the tabs
in, just sliding the tabs in.

00:35:56.810 --> 00:35:59.620
This is also like
doing that last move.

00:35:59.620 --> 00:36:02.275
So this tab's got to go in
here between these two tabs.

00:36:06.012 --> 00:36:07.470
It wouldn't hold
together very well

00:36:07.470 --> 00:36:10.140
if it wasn't hard
to put together.

00:36:10.140 --> 00:36:13.260
So once you've got them
together, you've got two cubes.

00:36:13.260 --> 00:36:15.240
Now if you want, for
a finishing touch,

00:36:15.240 --> 00:36:23.070
you can also make another
unit and cover the surfaces.

00:36:23.070 --> 00:36:24.960
So all of Jeannine
Moseley's examples

00:36:24.960 --> 00:36:31.150
are done this way where at
the end-- I haven't tried this

00:36:31.150 --> 00:36:34.995
lately-- you stick on a business
card just on the surface

00:36:34.995 --> 00:36:38.600
so it interlocks here and
then interlocks over here.

00:36:38.600 --> 00:36:42.070
Ho boy, this is challenging.

00:36:42.070 --> 00:36:46.196
And then you get a full square
business card on the outside.

00:36:46.196 --> 00:36:48.820
And you can use this to, if you
have different colored business

00:36:48.820 --> 00:36:52.100
cards or you want a nice,
clean white surface, no seams.

00:36:52.100 --> 00:36:53.540
So you have these
tabs right now,

00:36:53.540 --> 00:36:55.081
but once you add
something like this,

00:36:55.081 --> 00:36:57.730
you have a nice seamless
square on the outside.

00:36:57.730 --> 00:37:00.530
So you use up more
business cards,

00:37:00.530 --> 00:37:04.090
but it can make for
a nicer surface.

00:37:04.090 --> 00:37:06.930
So any questions
about making these?

00:37:06.930 --> 00:37:09.590
I thought we would make some
and then build something.

00:37:09.590 --> 00:37:12.870
But for that, I need
suggestions on what to build.

00:37:12.870 --> 00:37:14.156
Oh, an MIT.

00:37:14.156 --> 00:37:15.008
I like that.

00:37:15.008 --> 00:37:16.140
Let's make an MIT.

00:37:16.140 --> 00:37:17.160
So let's design.

00:37:17.160 --> 00:37:22.070
So by MIT, do you mean
MIT logo or like an M?

00:37:22.070 --> 00:37:25.460
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6,
7, 8, 9, 10 cubes.

00:37:25.460 --> 00:37:25.960
Easy.

00:37:29.660 --> 00:37:33.240
Exploding cubes.

00:37:33.240 --> 00:37:37.891
I wonder if you can use
these to make pinatas?

00:37:37.891 --> 00:37:38.390
MIT.

00:37:42.790 --> 00:37:44.960
We could also just make
a row at the bottom.

00:37:44.960 --> 00:37:48.440
One cube higher.

00:37:48.440 --> 00:37:50.919
Four more minutes.

00:37:50.919 --> 00:37:52.851
AUDIENCE: We could
do Minecraft origami.

00:37:52.851 --> 00:37:54.300
AUDIENCE: Ohh.

00:37:54.300 --> 00:37:55.132
AUDIENCE: Oh, yes!

00:37:55.132 --> 00:37:56.340
AUDIENCE: That's a good idea.

00:37:56.340 --> 00:37:59.080
PROFESSOR: Minecraft
is a good source.
