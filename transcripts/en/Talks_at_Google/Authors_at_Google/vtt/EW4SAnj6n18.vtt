[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:07.012 --> 00:00:08.720
SPEAKER: All right,
thank you for coming.

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:13.290
Today we're delighted to have
Mr. Ulrich Boser at Google.

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:16.940
He is the senior fellow at the
Center for American Progress,

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:19.610
where he writes about
education, and founded

00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:22.220
the Center of Science
of Learning Initiative.

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:25.190
He's here today to discuss
his third book, titled, "Learn

00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:28.390
Better, Mastering the Skills
for Success in Life, Business,

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:31.860
and School, or How To Become an
Expert in Just About Anything."

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:34.454
Please join me in
welcoming Mr. Boser.

00:00:34.454 --> 00:00:38.735
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:38.735 --> 00:00:40.860
ULRICH BOSER: So I'm up
here because I wrote a book

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:42.560
on the science of learning.

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:44.060
And it's gotten
some nice attention,

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:47.130
has been featured at NPR,
and "The Atlantic," "Wired,"

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:49.020
"Scientific American."

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:52.860
And it makes a pretty
simple argument.

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:56.760
For a long time, we've assumed
that the ability to learn

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:00.330
was a matter of intelligence,
sort of raw smarts,

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:02.970
intellectual power, sort
of cognitive horsepower.

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:06.330
And this is what IQ tests are
really supposed to measure--

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:09.030
your ability to reason
through new problems

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:10.770
to acquire expertise.

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:13.260
But what we know
now is that we can

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.850
get much better at learning.

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:19.410
There's specific
tools and strategies

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:21.510
that allow us to
acquire expertise

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:23.440
at much greater rates.

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:26.130
And in this way, we can
think about the skill

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:29.490
of learning to learn, really,
as a way to artificially improve

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:32.490
our intelligence.

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:35.880
So I first got interested in
this topic as a little kid.

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:37.020
That's me.

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:40.740
And I really had a hard
time learning in school.

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:43.110
I was in special education.

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:46.690
I repeated kindergarten.

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:50.940
I had one experience that I
talk about in the book, where

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:53.790
it was a 45-minute
class in math,

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:57.750
and I managed to be unable
to read my own handwriting.

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:00.270
I cheated off my neighbor.

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:04.560
Eventually, I acquired some
of the skills of learning.

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:08.639
Some just sort came to me
as they come to many of us

00:02:08.639 --> 00:02:09.810
over time--

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:11.430
started thinking about thinking.

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:13.380
But this is really what
sparked my interest

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:15.810
in learning overall.

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:19.260
And for the past 20
years or so on and off,

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:23.130
I've been writing and
researching about education.

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:25.800
So we're going to start a
little bit with some quizzes.

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:27.630
We're going to have
a lot of quizzes.

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:31.040
What's the capital of Australia?

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:34.031
So I had this
question posed to me.

00:02:34.031 --> 00:02:35.030
And it was embarrassing.

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:37.940
It was like a researcher was
posing the question to me.

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:41.120
And I was, like, I should
know the answer to this.

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:43.840
And I thought Sydney first.

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:44.570
I was wrong.

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:46.460
Melbourne, I was wrong.

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:52.680
The answer is C, as we have some
folks here who mentioned it.

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:54.560
So I'm going to up
the ante a little bit

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:56.990
here, since you guys knew
quickly, or at least some

00:02:56.990 --> 00:03:00.810
of you knew the answer to
the capital of Australia,

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:03.470
to the Immaculate Conception.

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:06.980
So the question here is, what
does the Immaculate Conception

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:08.560
revolve around?

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:12.884
Here, my first answer was Jesus.

00:03:12.884 --> 00:03:14.800
I mean, that's sort of
the popular conception.

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:16.410
And I'll acknowledge
here at the front

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:20.300
that this idea is
specific to Christianity

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:22.100
and within a cultural context.

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:24.950
But it turns out that
the answer is a--

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:27.680
that Immaculate Conception
is all about Mary.

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:29.880
It's not about Jesus.

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:32.240
So researchers call this
the hypercorrection effect.

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:34.490
And what's interesting about
it is, the more confident

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:38.600
you are in your answer, and
then you're shown to be wrong,

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:40.760
the more likely you
are to have learned

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:44.150
and to retain that
information into the future.

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:45.950
And so what I find
interesting about this

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:48.672
is that I think a lot of
people think about learning,

00:03:48.672 --> 00:03:50.630
and think about the brain
like it's a computer.

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:51.740
There's data out there.

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:53.240
And the data comes to you.

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:56.254
And maybe you process it, and
you put into little boxes.

00:03:56.254 --> 00:03:58.670
But if that were true-- if the
brain functioned that way--

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:00.680
you wouldn't have a
hypercorrection effect.

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:03.480
I mean, errors would mean that
you're actually not learning.

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:05.313
But what we've seen
from something like this

00:04:05.313 --> 00:04:10.310
is actually the more wrong
that you are, the actually more

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:12.510
that you learn.

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:14.325
And so when we
think about this--

00:04:14.325 --> 00:04:16.700
and this kind of brings us to
this sort of first lesson--

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:18.690
is that learning
is sense making,

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:20.899
that our brain is
not like a computer

00:04:20.899 --> 00:04:23.250
and we have to make
sense of material.

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:26.180
And a lot of research
makes this true.

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:29.330
And it also helps us think a
little bit about certain study

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:29.870
strategies.

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:33.950
So over the past 10 years, we've
seen a wealth of evidence show

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:35.780
that some really common
study strategies,

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:38.670
common tools for people to
learn, aren't that effective.

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:41.090
So rereading, not
that effective.

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:44.750
Highlighters, which we see in
office buildings and schools--

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:46.760
I work often in a law library.

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:50.040
Not only do these students
have lots of highlighters,

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:51.790
they have different
colored highlighters.

00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:54.040
I really want to go to them,
and say, there's actually

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:55.490
no research behind those.

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:57.560
Underlining is the same thing.

00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:00.450
So on the other side, what
is sort of sense making?

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:04.069
And examples of that is
something like self-explaining,

00:05:04.069 --> 00:05:06.110
which is sort of really
a form of quizzing, which

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:07.901
is why we're going to
have a lot of quizzes

00:05:07.901 --> 00:05:11.390
as I'm talking up here.

00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:13.110
And this is an example.

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:14.750
This is a guy named Brian Ross.

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:17.660
He was a professor
for a long time

00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:19.590
at the University of Illinois.

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:23.510
He got an opportunity to take an
Artificial Intelligence class.

00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:26.000
And you can imagine he took
it with other undergraduates.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:29.150
And he knew very immediately,
he stood out right.

00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:31.264
He's sort of older, balding.

00:05:31.264 --> 00:05:33.180
But he really wanted to
do well in this class.

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:34.596
And so what he did
was just engage

00:05:34.596 --> 00:05:36.620
in a lot of self-explaining.

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:37.700
Basic idea is this--

00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:39.350
at the end of a page, at
the end of a paragraph,

00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:41.433
at the end of a sentence
is to explain to yourself

00:05:41.433 --> 00:05:43.610
what exactly you're learning.

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:47.810
The approach shows a lot of
effectiveness in the research.

00:05:47.810 --> 00:05:51.635
And for Brian Ross himself, he
wasn't able to code as well as

00:05:51.635 --> 00:05:52.760
some of the other students.

00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:54.980
They had a lot more
prior knowledge.

00:05:54.980 --> 00:05:56.690
But he was able to
learn a lot more.

00:05:56.690 --> 00:05:59.630
In many instances, he actually
just simply understood

00:05:59.630 --> 00:06:01.849
a lot more than
the other students.

00:06:01.849 --> 00:06:03.890
And when we think about
learning as sense making,

00:06:03.890 --> 00:06:07.520
as a way of sort of
actively engaging material,

00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:10.460
another thing makes sense
is explaining something

00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:11.540
to other people.

00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:13.850
So researchers
really love to name

00:06:13.850 --> 00:06:15.590
things specific in psychology.

00:06:15.590 --> 00:06:17.440
This is now known as
the protege effect,

00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:20.480
and explains why explaining
something to someone else

00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:23.220
is actually like a really
effective way to learn.

00:06:23.220 --> 00:06:25.190
So an example of this
is Richard Feynman,

00:06:25.190 --> 00:06:26.630
might be familiar
to many of you--

00:06:26.630 --> 00:06:30.562
one of the most well-known,
successful physicists

00:06:30.562 --> 00:06:33.340
in sort of the modern times.

00:06:33.340 --> 00:06:38.330
And he once had his boss,
the Provost at Caltech,

00:06:38.330 --> 00:06:40.400
come to him, and
was, like, look,

00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:45.920
I'm not entirely sure sort
of how half-particles obey

00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:48.470
this form of Dirac statistics.

00:06:48.470 --> 00:06:51.180
And finally, he was like, OK,
I'm going to figure this out.

00:06:51.180 --> 00:06:53.972
I'm going explain it
to a bunch of freshmen.

00:06:53.972 --> 00:06:55.430
Comes back a few
weeks later, he's,

00:06:55.430 --> 00:06:57.263
like, I can't actually
explain this to them.

00:06:57.263 --> 00:07:00.360
And that means we don't
really understand it.

00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:04.250
So I really just want to make
clear that testing yourself

00:07:04.250 --> 00:07:06.880
is a really fantastic
way to learn.

00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:09.680
There's a study done
by Jeff Karpicke.

00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:12.736
And what you can see here
is you see the study once.

00:07:12.736 --> 00:07:14.360
This is what many of
us did in college.

00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:16.310
You get some text.

00:07:16.310 --> 00:07:17.300
You read it once.

00:07:17.300 --> 00:07:20.120
And then you take a test.

00:07:20.120 --> 00:07:23.330
Repeated study, sort of the
more diligent college students--

00:07:23.330 --> 00:07:25.400
they read the text once
and then they're, like, I

00:07:25.400 --> 00:07:26.270
should probably read it again.

00:07:26.270 --> 00:07:27.570
So they read it a second time.

00:07:27.570 --> 00:07:28.850
You can see how they do.

00:07:28.850 --> 00:07:31.370
Concept mapping might be
familiar to many of you.

00:07:31.370 --> 00:07:37.550
But this idea that you're trying
to create relationships, so

00:07:37.550 --> 00:07:39.930
spokes and hubs.

00:07:39.930 --> 00:07:43.940
So we see that doesn't do quite
as well as repeated study.

00:07:43.940 --> 00:07:45.560
And then you see
retrieval practice.

00:07:45.560 --> 00:07:47.660
Retrieval practice is the
word that psychologists

00:07:47.660 --> 00:07:50.210
use for this idea
that you're just

00:07:50.210 --> 00:07:51.810
pulling things out of memory.

00:07:51.810 --> 00:07:53.600
So what these students
did was simply

00:07:53.600 --> 00:07:55.610
to have an open piece
of paper, and they

00:07:55.610 --> 00:07:58.400
were told to recall the
information that they had just

00:07:58.400 --> 00:07:58.940
read.

00:07:58.940 --> 00:08:01.010
And as you can see,
they did much better

00:08:01.010 --> 00:08:04.650
than the other students.

00:08:04.650 --> 00:08:08.140
So we're going to go
here to another quiz.

00:08:08.140 --> 00:08:10.300
This idea is related
to the first.

00:08:10.300 --> 00:08:13.780
And the question is, do
you block your practice

00:08:13.780 --> 00:08:15.220
or do you mix your practice?

00:08:15.220 --> 00:08:18.280
So to put this in
another way, would you

00:08:18.280 --> 00:08:22.390
if you are playing the piano,
do all Mozart in one day,

00:08:22.390 --> 00:08:25.510
all Bach on the next day,
and then a little Chopin

00:08:25.510 --> 00:08:29.020
on the third day, or
in each study session,

00:08:29.020 --> 00:08:30.810
do you mix it up?

00:08:30.810 --> 00:08:32.919
So in each study session,
each practice session,

00:08:32.919 --> 00:08:35.956
do you do a little
Mozart, a little Chopin?

00:08:35.956 --> 00:08:38.289
So I'm just going to do a
little sort of random calling.

00:08:38.289 --> 00:08:39.580
You, what do you think--

00:08:39.580 --> 00:08:41.049
mixed approach,
blocked approach?

00:08:41.049 --> 00:08:41.799
AUDIENCE: Mixed approach.

00:08:41.799 --> 00:08:43.390
ULRICH BOSER: Mixed
approach-- so mixed approach

00:08:43.390 --> 00:08:44.320
is the correct answer.

00:08:44.320 --> 00:08:47.080
Most students choose the
sort of blocked approach.

00:08:47.080 --> 00:08:48.910
The reason that this
works is actually

00:08:48.910 --> 00:08:52.780
kind of similar to
learning as sense making.

00:08:52.780 --> 00:08:54.970
It actually prevents
you from being

00:08:54.970 --> 00:08:58.390
too robotic in the
way that you practice.

00:08:58.390 --> 00:09:00.370
So this brings us to
our second lesson--

00:09:00.370 --> 00:09:02.200
got to mix it up.

00:09:02.200 --> 00:09:05.590
For me, I found this
really fascinating.

00:09:05.590 --> 00:09:08.050
And it gets at sort
of this bigger issue.

00:09:08.050 --> 00:09:10.210
It's sort of doing something.

00:09:10.210 --> 00:09:11.590
It's not learning.

00:09:11.590 --> 00:09:14.300
You don't actually get better
simply by doing something.

00:09:14.300 --> 00:09:16.090
For myself, a great
example is driving.

00:09:16.090 --> 00:09:18.190
I've been driving since I'm 18.

00:09:18.190 --> 00:09:20.962
I have not gotten any better.

00:09:20.962 --> 00:09:22.420
Handwriting's pretty
similar to me.

00:09:22.420 --> 00:09:26.380
I've been writing
things, write every day.

00:09:26.380 --> 00:09:30.430
And I have not gotten better
since sort of middle school.

00:09:30.430 --> 00:09:31.900
So I also play a
lot of basketball.

00:09:31.900 --> 00:09:33.412
And my wife and kids were away.

00:09:33.412 --> 00:09:34.870
And it was just
very apparent to me

00:09:34.870 --> 00:09:38.487
that I was one of the worst guys
out on the basketball court.

00:09:38.487 --> 00:09:39.820
So I took lessons with this guy.

00:09:39.820 --> 00:09:43.060
He played for the Harlem
Globetrotters, name was Dwayne.

00:09:43.060 --> 00:09:47.140
What was impressive to me
is one, I got a lot better--

00:09:47.140 --> 00:09:50.075
not great, but a lot better,
just with like two sessions.

00:09:50.075 --> 00:09:51.700
And it's kind of
crazy to me, because I

00:09:51.700 --> 00:09:54.160
was, like, I've been writing
about education for, like, 20

00:09:54.160 --> 00:09:56.830
years, and still I was sort
of skeptical about the power

00:09:56.830 --> 00:09:59.200
of these very basic
things like feedback.

00:09:59.200 --> 00:10:02.320
And then I started to get a lot
more into the sort of science

00:10:02.320 --> 00:10:05.920
of learning, and was, like,
oh, I should really then use

00:10:05.920 --> 00:10:07.660
interleaving in my own life.

00:10:07.660 --> 00:10:09.250
It showed impressive effects.

00:10:09.250 --> 00:10:11.800
What's remarkable about this is
that this has been documented

00:10:11.800 --> 00:10:13.660
since, like, the 1970s.

00:10:13.660 --> 00:10:16.315
It's been documented across
different subject areas.

00:10:16.315 --> 00:10:18.940
It's even been documented
in basketball in a study

00:10:18.940 --> 00:10:23.320
from 1972, with a group of
female basketball players.

00:10:23.320 --> 00:10:25.120
But I have little kids at home.

00:10:25.120 --> 00:10:28.420
And one of them is eight.

00:10:28.420 --> 00:10:30.490
She's studying her
division timetables.

00:10:30.490 --> 00:10:32.290
And you know how they come home.

00:10:32.290 --> 00:10:34.630
And she studies an 8
timetable on one day.

00:10:34.630 --> 00:10:37.864
She studies her nine
timestable the next week.

00:10:37.864 --> 00:10:39.280
And it's just a
very clear example

00:10:39.280 --> 00:10:43.270
that we really just don't do
enough to interleave, to mix up

00:10:43.270 --> 00:10:45.830
the way that we learn.

00:10:45.830 --> 00:10:48.770
The other thing that's
interesting about interleaving

00:10:48.770 --> 00:10:51.110
is it one, it needs to be
in the same subject area.

00:10:51.110 --> 00:10:54.190
If you're trying to
get better at knitting,

00:10:54.190 --> 00:10:57.080
you're not going to interleave
with coding or diving

00:10:57.080 --> 00:10:59.280
or whatever else
you want to learn.

00:10:59.280 --> 00:11:02.842
But the other reason that
interleaving is so powerful

00:11:02.842 --> 00:11:04.550
is that it allows us
to understand what's

00:11:04.550 --> 00:11:06.110
called the "deep feature."

00:11:06.110 --> 00:11:07.830
The deep feature is
really what you want

00:11:07.830 --> 00:11:09.080
to learn when you're learning.

00:11:09.080 --> 00:11:11.720
And when you vary
the surface features,

00:11:11.720 --> 00:11:14.720
you're going to understand
what that basic idea is.

00:11:14.720 --> 00:11:17.510
And that allows you to engage
in sort of pattern recognition.

00:11:17.510 --> 00:11:19.250
A very simple example
of this is that you

00:11:19.250 --> 00:11:20.540
want to learn 4 plus 4.

00:11:20.540 --> 00:11:23.240
One way would be to do it
in mathematical notation.

00:11:23.240 --> 00:11:25.880
You can change the surface
features pretty easily

00:11:25.880 --> 00:11:27.950
by doing it in a word problem.

00:11:27.950 --> 00:11:29.160
Johnny comes into a school.

00:11:29.160 --> 00:11:29.810
He has four.

00:11:29.810 --> 00:11:32.240
And you can see where
interleaving in that way

00:11:32.240 --> 00:11:37.230
will produce these
much greater effects.

00:11:37.230 --> 00:11:41.300
This is another quiz question,
a moment for you guys

00:11:41.300 --> 00:11:44.230
to read it over.

00:11:57.440 --> 00:12:00.245
So guesses?

00:12:00.245 --> 00:12:02.370
So I think the key thing
is to commit to an answer.

00:12:02.370 --> 00:12:03.750
We knew from the
hypercorrection effect

00:12:03.750 --> 00:12:05.580
that the more that you
commit to an answer, the more

00:12:05.580 --> 00:12:06.540
that you're actually
going to learn.

00:12:06.540 --> 00:12:08.790
So me just sort of
randomly calling on people

00:12:08.790 --> 00:12:11.540
isn't me being a
effort as much as we

00:12:11.540 --> 00:12:14.634
all gain a little
bit more from this.

00:12:14.634 --> 00:12:15.590
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:12:15.590 --> 00:12:15.930
ULRICH BOSER: Yeah.

00:12:15.930 --> 00:12:16.990
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] D.

00:12:16.990 --> 00:12:17.950
ULRICH BOSER: D,
all of the above.

00:12:17.950 --> 00:12:18.690
Right.

00:12:18.690 --> 00:12:21.010
This is a very key
idea here, and that

00:12:21.010 --> 00:12:23.110
is that context really matters.

00:12:23.110 --> 00:12:26.050
This could really be
from all of the above.

00:12:26.050 --> 00:12:27.895
And the context in
which you read that

00:12:27.895 --> 00:12:30.020
is really going to change
the way that you're going

00:12:30.020 --> 00:12:32.080
to understand that material.

00:12:32.080 --> 00:12:34.240
So this gets us to
Lesson 3, you need

00:12:34.240 --> 00:12:36.370
to think about your thinking.

00:12:36.370 --> 00:12:38.230
And researchers
call this something

00:12:38.230 --> 00:12:39.456
called meta-cognition.

00:12:39.456 --> 00:12:41.330
And it kind of appears
in two different ways.

00:12:41.330 --> 00:12:42.630
One is sort of planning.

00:12:42.630 --> 00:12:44.380
When you're thinking about
your thinking, you're thinking,

00:12:44.380 --> 00:12:45.656
will I understand this?

00:12:45.656 --> 00:12:47.530
What are the goals that
I need to accomplish?

00:12:47.530 --> 00:12:50.860
How am I actually going
to measure what I know?

00:12:50.860 --> 00:12:52.860
And then the other is
sort of monitoring.

00:12:52.860 --> 00:12:56.554
And it is this idea that we
are sort of-- do I really

00:12:56.554 --> 00:12:57.220
understand this?

00:12:57.220 --> 00:12:59.170
Does this come from
a dishwasher manual?

00:12:59.170 --> 00:13:03.670
Or is this really
sort of from a patent?

00:13:03.670 --> 00:13:06.070
The key thing to
understand here is

00:13:06.070 --> 00:13:08.110
that we're all overconfident.

00:13:08.110 --> 00:13:11.650
If you do surveys of
people, most people

00:13:11.650 --> 00:13:14.950
say that they are above average
when it comes to driving.

00:13:14.950 --> 00:13:17.080
Most people say that
they're above average

00:13:17.080 --> 00:13:18.574
when it comes to looks.

00:13:18.574 --> 00:13:19.990
Most people are
above average when

00:13:19.990 --> 00:13:22.630
you ask them do they work
harder than their coworkers.

00:13:22.630 --> 00:13:25.752
But we know that everyone
can't be above average.

00:13:25.752 --> 00:13:27.460
Now, lots has been
written about the sort

00:13:27.460 --> 00:13:28.890
of idea of overconfidence.

00:13:28.890 --> 00:13:32.092
It's sort of like a key notion
of behavioral economics.

00:13:32.092 --> 00:13:33.550
But when it comes
to learning, it's

00:13:33.550 --> 00:13:37.970
really important, because
our goal is, actually,

00:13:37.970 --> 00:13:38.960
to really understand.

00:13:38.960 --> 00:13:41.660
And there are so many
things that we actually

00:13:41.660 --> 00:13:43.840
think that we know, but
we don't really know.

00:13:43.840 --> 00:13:45.173
This happens to me all the time.

00:13:45.173 --> 00:13:47.030
It's happened to me
like once a month.

00:13:47.030 --> 00:13:48.931
Most recently, my kids
went to Gettysburg.

00:13:48.931 --> 00:13:50.930
And I was, like, oh, yeah,
I learned about that.

00:13:50.930 --> 00:13:52.820
And I could maybe
get through sort

00:13:52.820 --> 00:13:55.980
of what would be the first
paragraph on the Gettysburg

00:13:55.980 --> 00:13:56.480
website.

00:13:56.480 --> 00:13:59.060
But then when they asked
any reasonable question--

00:13:59.060 --> 00:14:02.490
who was the general
for the North--

00:14:02.490 --> 00:14:04.370
I simply had no idea.

00:14:04.370 --> 00:14:06.830
And fluency plays
a big role in this.

00:14:06.830 --> 00:14:08.860
The more that you're
familiar with something,

00:14:08.860 --> 00:14:13.610
and you might think that
you know a lot about it,

00:14:13.610 --> 00:14:16.770
but you end up not, which is
explains why a lot of people

00:14:16.770 --> 00:14:19.410
think that they really know
how a toilet bowl works.

00:14:19.410 --> 00:14:21.200
You spend a lot of
time on toilet bowls.

00:14:21.200 --> 00:14:22.440
But if I were to ask--

00:14:22.440 --> 00:14:24.050
and certainly most
people maybe here--

00:14:24.050 --> 00:14:26.210
really explain what
the engineering that

00:14:26.210 --> 00:14:30.560
goes behind the toilet bowl,
it's hard for most of us.

00:14:30.560 --> 00:14:34.810
The second aspect of
metacognition is monitoring.

00:14:34.810 --> 00:14:38.040
And it's sort of an ancillary
to the idea of feedback,

00:14:38.040 --> 00:14:43.140
which is why Dwayne
Samuels, my baseball coach,

00:14:43.140 --> 00:14:44.780
was so effective.

00:14:44.780 --> 00:14:48.140
And really it's this idea
that you're actually paying

00:14:48.140 --> 00:14:50.619
attention to what you're doing.

00:14:50.619 --> 00:14:52.910
I don't pay enough attention
to driving, which explains

00:14:52.910 --> 00:14:54.501
why I am not a better driver.

00:14:54.501 --> 00:14:56.000
I clearly don't pay
enough attention

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:57.625
to my handwriting,
which explains why I

00:14:57.625 --> 00:14:58.940
haven't gotten better at that.

00:14:58.940 --> 00:15:00.650
But even just a little
bit of monitoring

00:15:00.650 --> 00:15:04.040
can go an incredibly far way.

00:15:04.040 --> 00:15:08.770
My favorite example here is a
guy, a neurosurgeon in Canada.

00:15:08.770 --> 00:15:10.520
And what he did was
something very simple.

00:15:10.520 --> 00:15:12.353
For every surgery that
he had, he would just

00:15:12.353 --> 00:15:15.685
write down what went wrong.

00:15:15.685 --> 00:15:17.810
So if he dropped a scalpel,
he'd make a note of it.

00:15:17.810 --> 00:15:21.650
If he miscommunicated to a
nurse, he'd note that, too.

00:15:21.650 --> 00:15:25.550
And he found
tremendous improvements

00:15:25.550 --> 00:15:28.010
in his performance, not
only over the first year

00:15:28.010 --> 00:15:31.190
that he did it, but over
a period of 10 years.

00:15:31.190 --> 00:15:34.750
The other thing about this
type of monitoring is--

00:15:34.750 --> 00:15:37.550
and really feedback in general--
is that it's embarrassing.

00:15:37.550 --> 00:15:41.180
So whether I go to
see a basketball coach

00:15:41.180 --> 00:15:44.030
and I'm in my 40s, and basically
all of his other clients

00:15:44.030 --> 00:15:45.327
are little kids--

00:15:45.327 --> 00:15:46.160
that's embarrassing.

00:15:46.160 --> 00:15:48.160
I didn't actually really
tell most of the people

00:15:48.160 --> 00:15:50.510
that I took the
basketball lessons with.

00:15:50.510 --> 00:15:51.800
The neurosurgeon had an even--

00:15:51.800 --> 00:15:54.890
I frankly think-- a much
more embarrassing experience.

00:15:54.890 --> 00:15:56.690
He ended up dropping
someone's skull

00:15:56.690 --> 00:15:59.180
during a surgery, a size of
some skull about the size

00:15:59.180 --> 00:16:01.160
of a quarter, and then
had to go to that family

00:16:01.160 --> 00:16:03.050
and be, like, oh,
I'm really sorry.

00:16:03.050 --> 00:16:07.470
I dropped a piece of
your husband's skull.

00:16:07.470 --> 00:16:09.074
And he describes
that as mortifying.

00:16:09.074 --> 00:16:10.490
I think it helps
us understand why

00:16:10.490 --> 00:16:13.610
we don't engage in enough
monitoring, why we don't engage

00:16:13.610 --> 00:16:16.790
in enough feedback.

00:16:16.790 --> 00:16:19.860
So we have another
quiz question here.

00:16:19.860 --> 00:16:23.770
Give you guys a
moment to look at it.

00:16:30.350 --> 00:16:32.140
Want to give it a shot?

00:16:32.140 --> 00:16:34.040
AUDIENCE: C.

00:16:34.040 --> 00:16:36.230
ULRICH BOSER: C-- so
more than five items.

00:16:36.230 --> 00:16:39.380
For a long time, people believed
that C was the right answer.

00:16:39.380 --> 00:16:41.480
A lot of early
research on this idea

00:16:41.480 --> 00:16:46.370
was seven items, plus
or minus one or two.

00:16:46.370 --> 00:16:49.170
It turns out that this research
that was done in the 1950s.

00:16:49.170 --> 00:16:51.860
What researchers
know now is that it's

00:16:51.860 --> 00:16:54.920
much closer to
three to five items.

00:16:54.920 --> 00:16:58.280
So we're going to talk about in
this quick lesson remembering

00:16:58.280 --> 00:16:59.090
memory.

00:16:59.090 --> 00:17:00.820
And what we're going
to talk about first

00:17:00.820 --> 00:17:02.906
is short-term memory.

00:17:02.906 --> 00:17:04.405
If we're going to
go the next slide.

00:17:08.166 --> 00:17:10.290
Looks like we're not going
to go to the next slide.

00:17:10.290 --> 00:17:12.780
But what is important
about this idea,

00:17:12.780 --> 00:17:15.109
short-term memory is
really, really small.

00:17:15.109 --> 00:17:19.109
It's smaller than most people
believe that it's going to be.

00:17:19.109 --> 00:17:21.270
So this helps us
understand why it's so

00:17:21.270 --> 00:17:22.980
hard to remember phone numbers.

00:17:22.980 --> 00:17:25.530
For a long time, the
telephone companies,

00:17:25.530 --> 00:17:27.750
when they first rolled
out telephone numbers,

00:17:27.750 --> 00:17:30.480
they did it with a mix of
address and a mix of numbers.

00:17:30.480 --> 00:17:33.900
So you have something
like Elmwood 935.

00:17:33.900 --> 00:17:35.760
Then the research came
out by Herbert Simon

00:17:35.760 --> 00:17:37.720
and others, 1950s.

00:17:37.720 --> 00:17:40.560
And they knew it's seven digits.

00:17:40.560 --> 00:17:45.210
So this would be a
number like 472-6078.

00:17:45.210 --> 00:17:47.970
And now it's clear that the
telephone companies realize

00:17:47.970 --> 00:17:50.370
that short-term memory is
even shorter than that, which

00:17:50.370 --> 00:17:52.328
is why numbers that you
really need to remember

00:17:52.328 --> 00:17:54.660
are like 9-1-1 and 3-1-1.

00:17:54.660 --> 00:17:57.390
So why is this so important
besides telephone numbers

00:17:57.390 --> 00:17:59.750
is that everything you learn--

00:17:59.750 --> 00:18:03.810
knitting, diving,
driving-- it all

00:18:03.810 --> 00:18:06.060
goes through short-term memory.

00:18:06.060 --> 00:18:09.150
And the thing is that
short-term memory is so short

00:18:09.150 --> 00:18:10.874
that we can't hold a
lot in it, and this

00:18:10.874 --> 00:18:13.540
helps us really understand a lot
of other things about learning.

00:18:13.540 --> 00:18:16.780
It explains why educators
are so important.

00:18:16.780 --> 00:18:19.020
You want something to
be explained in a way

00:18:19.020 --> 00:18:21.190
that it doesn't overwhelm
short-term learning.

00:18:21.190 --> 00:18:24.212
It explains why
checking your phone,

00:18:24.212 --> 00:18:26.170
or visiting the internet
while you're learning,

00:18:26.170 --> 00:18:29.640
or even engaged in a heavy
thought process doesn't work.

00:18:29.640 --> 00:18:32.640
It also explains why
slides like these--

00:18:32.640 --> 00:18:35.640
we should aim to
have them very clean,

00:18:35.640 --> 00:18:38.377
because they don't
overwhelm short-term memory.

00:18:38.377 --> 00:18:40.710
The other side of short-term
memory is long-term memory.

00:18:40.710 --> 00:18:41.835
So you process information.

00:18:41.835 --> 00:18:44.350
It goes into long-term memory.

00:18:44.350 --> 00:18:47.460
And long-term memory works,
basically, on knowledge.

00:18:47.460 --> 00:18:51.510
It works on context, on what
researchers call schemas.

00:18:51.510 --> 00:18:53.149
And this is important
for learning,

00:18:53.149 --> 00:18:55.440
because there is this debate
in learning whether or not

00:18:55.440 --> 00:18:58.560
you should be able-- you
should learn any facts if we

00:18:58.560 --> 00:19:00.640
can Google all the facts.

00:19:00.640 --> 00:19:03.720
So if Wikipedia allows all
the information to be free,

00:19:03.720 --> 00:19:06.360
should we learn any facts?

00:19:06.360 --> 00:19:08.190
And long-term memory
makes it very clear

00:19:08.190 --> 00:19:10.410
that facts are
incredibly important.

00:19:10.410 --> 00:19:16.470
My example on this is I
can say, [SPEAKING GERMAN]..

00:19:16.470 --> 00:19:19.260
Now, you can immediately look
all those German words up

00:19:19.260 --> 00:19:20.250
on your phone.

00:19:20.250 --> 00:19:22.520
But it is very hard to
actually make sense of them,

00:19:22.520 --> 00:19:25.470
to really fluently speak
in another language,

00:19:25.470 --> 00:19:28.205
unless you have that
basic knowledge of facts.

00:19:28.205 --> 00:19:29.580
So really, it's
important that we

00:19:29.580 --> 00:19:32.490
start thinking about facts
as the sort of basic building

00:19:32.490 --> 00:19:35.160
blocks of memory--

00:19:35.160 --> 00:19:39.180
that they are ways
for us to engage.

00:19:39.180 --> 00:19:40.830
And really one of
the best predictors

00:19:40.830 --> 00:19:44.211
of can you be better at physics
is your knowledge of physics.

00:19:44.211 --> 00:19:45.960
The best way to become
better at chemistry

00:19:45.960 --> 00:19:49.770
is simply raw knowledge
about chemistry.

00:19:49.770 --> 00:19:52.140
When we think about
memory, there's

00:19:52.140 --> 00:19:54.190
another concept that
becomes really important.

00:19:54.190 --> 00:19:56.280
And that's this idea of spacing.

00:19:56.280 --> 00:20:00.930
This is an idea that dates
back to the 19th century.

00:20:00.930 --> 00:20:02.340
And basically, we forget.

00:20:02.340 --> 00:20:04.870
We all forget at a
very regular rate.

00:20:04.870 --> 00:20:09.230
And we often forget
about how much we forget.

00:20:09.230 --> 00:20:11.700
And so there's something
called "the spacing curve."

00:20:11.700 --> 00:20:15.870
My quiz on this is sort of
how much of this specific talk

00:20:15.870 --> 00:20:18.300
do you think you're going
to remember tomorrow,

00:20:18.300 --> 00:20:21.569
25%, 50%, 75%?

00:20:21.569 --> 00:20:22.860
So sir, I'm going to I ask you.

00:20:22.860 --> 00:20:23.609
What do you think?

00:20:23.609 --> 00:20:25.950
Tomorrow, 24 hours
after this talk,

00:20:25.950 --> 00:20:28.870
I ask you retrieval practice.

00:20:28.870 --> 00:20:30.432
Was it mentioned in the talk?

00:20:30.432 --> 00:20:31.890
What do you think
is the likelihood

00:20:31.890 --> 00:20:32.900
that you'll recall it?

00:20:38.120 --> 00:20:38.742
What's that?

00:20:38.742 --> 00:20:40.390
AUDIENCE: A
reasonable likelihood.

00:20:40.390 --> 00:20:42.015
ULRICH BOSER: A
reasonable likelihood--

00:20:42.015 --> 00:20:45.080
so reasonable likelihood
to me sounds like 50%.

00:20:45.080 --> 00:20:47.500
So that is the correct answer.

00:20:47.500 --> 00:20:50.090
What's frankly hard
is that I'm up here,

00:20:50.090 --> 00:20:52.610
and I know that by tomorrow,
you're going to forget 50%.

00:20:52.610 --> 00:20:57.200
If you don't revisit anything
of it, within a week it's gone.

00:20:57.200 --> 00:21:02.130
So my favorite example of this
is a guy named Roger Craig.

00:21:02.130 --> 00:21:04.430
He comes across to spacing
research, this idea

00:21:04.430 --> 00:21:08.540
that we forget at a
very regular rate.

00:21:08.540 --> 00:21:10.640
This was about 10 years ago.

00:21:10.640 --> 00:21:12.750
And he started creating
his own software,

00:21:12.750 --> 00:21:15.320
then eventually uses
some online software,

00:21:15.320 --> 00:21:19.130
to revisit ideas at the rate
of forgetting-- sort of right

00:21:19.130 --> 00:21:20.360
at the edge of this curve.

00:21:20.360 --> 00:21:22.890
We know when we're going
to forget something.

00:21:22.890 --> 00:21:24.500
And if we revisit
that item, we're

00:21:24.500 --> 00:21:27.950
going to remember it for longer.

00:21:27.950 --> 00:21:30.790
So Roger Craig first
develops the software

00:21:30.790 --> 00:21:33.770
itself, then eventually uses
an online software called Anki,

00:21:33.770 --> 00:21:35.870
which is fantastic, if
you haven't ever used it

00:21:35.870 --> 00:21:38.210
for this type of knowledge.

00:21:38.210 --> 00:21:40.690
And what happens is he goes--

00:21:40.690 --> 00:21:43.340
and the thing about Roger
Craig that is key to this story

00:21:43.340 --> 00:21:44.661
is that he loves games.

00:21:44.661 --> 00:21:46.910
He loves baseball, football,
and he watched "Jeopardy"

00:21:46.910 --> 00:21:47.880
growing up with his parents.

00:21:47.880 --> 00:21:50.004
He's like, I'm going to
use the science of learning

00:21:50.004 --> 00:21:52.610
to get better at "Jeopardy."

00:21:52.610 --> 00:21:56.200
Roger Craig goes on "Jeopardy"
for his very first time.

00:21:56.200 --> 00:21:59.300
He goes to Los Angeles, and
he's there with Alex Trebek.

00:21:59.300 --> 00:22:01.310
He does so well on
his very first time

00:22:01.310 --> 00:22:05.480
that he wins the record
for the first day

00:22:05.480 --> 00:22:08.510
amount of winnings on that.

00:22:08.510 --> 00:22:11.177
He did so well that when he went
home, and was in his hotel room

00:22:11.177 --> 00:22:12.801
that night, he was,
like, they're never

00:22:12.801 --> 00:22:13.820
going to call me back.

00:22:13.820 --> 00:22:16.237
I did so well on these
types of recalling

00:22:16.237 --> 00:22:18.320
of facts that he was, like,
they're just not going

00:22:18.320 --> 00:22:19.280
to have me on.

00:22:19.280 --> 00:22:21.500
Now, Roger Craig
has gone back on.

00:22:21.500 --> 00:22:23.210
He's competed
against Ken Jennings,

00:22:23.210 --> 00:22:26.430
and he's sort of one of
the top "Jeopardy" champs.

00:22:26.430 --> 00:22:29.090
And it is really just
using the spacing effect

00:22:29.090 --> 00:22:31.440
to revisit knowledge
at this point of time.

00:22:31.440 --> 00:22:33.410
And it's really
incredibly powerful.

00:22:33.410 --> 00:22:35.370
And it doesn't really
take huge intervention.

00:22:35.370 --> 00:22:39.950
So in my family now, we don't
do homework on Wednesday night.

00:22:39.950 --> 00:22:42.170
One thing you can do to
space out learning more

00:22:42.170 --> 00:22:44.510
is to, instead of doing the
homework-- my kids usually

00:22:44.510 --> 00:22:46.850
have homework on Monday,
Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday--

00:22:46.850 --> 00:22:49.980
take that Wednesday,
slide it into Sunday.

00:22:49.980 --> 00:22:52.220
So it's this idea of just
spacing out that learning,

00:22:52.220 --> 00:22:55.544
allowing for that
inevitable forgetting.

00:22:55.544 --> 00:22:57.460
Now, I'm going to admit
that this has not made

00:22:57.460 --> 00:22:59.090
me more popular as a parent.

00:22:59.090 --> 00:23:01.970
It sort of causes
dips in my dad stock.

00:23:01.970 --> 00:23:04.590
But I tell my kids, you're
actually going to learn more.

00:23:04.590 --> 00:23:06.590
It's the same amount of
time you spend studying,

00:23:06.590 --> 00:23:08.570
but you're going to
retain it for a lot more

00:23:08.570 --> 00:23:11.510
from this basic effect.

00:23:11.510 --> 00:23:14.510
So Roger Craig
himself will admit

00:23:14.510 --> 00:23:18.110
to anyone who speaks to him
that knowing the answer of who

00:23:18.110 --> 00:23:21.141
wrote "The Bridge on the River
Kwai," isn't real learning.

00:23:21.141 --> 00:23:23.390
It's just sort of a fact
that allowed him to do really

00:23:23.390 --> 00:23:25.760
well on "Jeopardy."

00:23:25.760 --> 00:23:28.970
Then the question is,
what really is expertise?

00:23:28.970 --> 00:23:34.517
What is mastery, and how do
we really want to learn it?

00:23:34.517 --> 00:23:36.350
I got a really interesting
idea, and there's

00:23:36.350 --> 00:23:38.600
a bunch of really
fascinating research

00:23:38.600 --> 00:23:41.840
on this, in that mastery,
really knowing something,

00:23:41.840 --> 00:23:42.910
is analogies.

00:23:42.910 --> 00:23:46.550
It's your ability to
think through in systems.

00:23:46.550 --> 00:23:48.260
So I don't know
if any of you ever

00:23:48.260 --> 00:23:51.320
listened to the "Car Talk"
show, but it's basically

00:23:51.320 --> 00:23:55.430
two goofy guys, and people call
in, and say, I have a Buick,

00:23:55.430 --> 00:23:57.195
and there's white
smoke coming out.

00:23:57.195 --> 00:23:58.570
I have a little
audio clip of it,

00:23:58.570 --> 00:24:04.040
but basically, it's a call-in
show for car problems.

00:24:04.040 --> 00:24:07.250
And if you listen to the
show carefully, what they do

00:24:07.250 --> 00:24:08.660
is crazy.

00:24:08.660 --> 00:24:10.030
They've never seen this.

00:24:10.030 --> 00:24:10.809
Someone calls in.

00:24:10.809 --> 00:24:12.350
They've never met
that person before.

00:24:12.350 --> 00:24:14.224
They don't know if
they're a reckless driver.

00:24:14.224 --> 00:24:16.940
They don't even know if they're
a student or a senior citizen.

00:24:16.940 --> 00:24:18.680
They've never seen
the car before.

00:24:18.680 --> 00:24:21.920
So they don't know
does it look dingy?

00:24:21.920 --> 00:24:24.080
They've never seen
what the problem is.

00:24:24.080 --> 00:24:27.760
And yet they are able to
diagnose these problems time

00:24:27.760 --> 00:24:28.940
and again.

00:24:28.940 --> 00:24:32.060
So the question then
is, how do they do it?

00:24:32.060 --> 00:24:33.710
They do it through analogies.

00:24:33.710 --> 00:24:35.497
If someone calls
in with a Buick,

00:24:35.497 --> 00:24:37.080
and they're saying
it has white smoke,

00:24:37.080 --> 00:24:40.770
they're going through their
own mental model, saying,

00:24:40.770 --> 00:24:42.270
have I ever worked
on Buicks before?

00:24:42.270 --> 00:24:43.860
What's the sign of white smoke?

00:24:43.860 --> 00:24:50.130
How does this match up with
other experiences that we have?

00:24:50.130 --> 00:24:52.580
And so when we think
about learning,

00:24:52.580 --> 00:24:54.140
and we think about
what we ultimately

00:24:54.140 --> 00:24:57.200
want to do with what we learn
is to apply it in new ways,

00:24:57.200 --> 00:24:59.540
making sure that you learn
in a systems approach,

00:24:59.540 --> 00:25:02.180
that you learn through
analogies, that you're thinking

00:25:02.180 --> 00:25:06.230
about compare and contrast,
is really, really crucial.

00:25:06.230 --> 00:25:10.990
So researchers have found
this in topics like math.

00:25:10.990 --> 00:25:13.790
This also explains
the idea of the deep

00:25:13.790 --> 00:25:18.172
versus surface features, been
able to show it in history.

00:25:18.172 --> 00:25:19.880
And I got kind of
excited about the idea,

00:25:19.880 --> 00:25:21.470
and was, like, I'm not
going to take a wine class.

00:25:21.470 --> 00:25:23.360
I don't know that
much about wine.

00:25:23.360 --> 00:25:25.640
If you think about
wine as analogies,

00:25:25.640 --> 00:25:28.160
I should take a
wine pairing class.

00:25:28.160 --> 00:25:29.680
And what was
remarkable to me was

00:25:29.680 --> 00:25:33.800
that the pairings did give me
a much richer sense of wine.

00:25:33.800 --> 00:25:37.460
So going in, understood
and was presented me

00:25:37.460 --> 00:25:41.510
how did the tannins relate to--

00:25:41.510 --> 00:25:43.940
or why exactly does
sort of a fatty cheese

00:25:43.940 --> 00:25:45.620
reduce the sort of
tannins that you'd

00:25:45.620 --> 00:25:47.390
find in a lot of red wines?

00:25:47.390 --> 00:25:52.010
Why do sweet wines
like a Gewurztraminer

00:25:52.010 --> 00:25:56.057
go well with spicy food.

00:25:56.057 --> 00:25:57.890
But this is different
than a lot of the ways

00:25:57.890 --> 00:26:00.835
that we would usually
engage with wine.

00:26:00.835 --> 00:26:02.210
I think a lot of
people would be,

00:26:02.210 --> 00:26:05.120
like, I need to figure
out what is a pinot noir?

00:26:05.120 --> 00:26:07.320
Where is a Gewurztraminer grown?

00:26:07.320 --> 00:26:09.320
When if you really want
to use that information,

00:26:09.320 --> 00:26:13.760
and use it in new ways,
you have to engage in what

00:26:13.760 --> 00:26:15.510
are the patterns.

00:26:15.510 --> 00:26:20.870
Another example of this is the
history example that I prefer.

00:26:20.870 --> 00:26:23.030
Let's say you want
to learn about war.

00:26:23.030 --> 00:26:26.310
You want to learn
about World War II.

00:26:26.310 --> 00:26:29.330
You can think about why did the
Germans win in World War II?

00:26:29.330 --> 00:26:30.830
One of the reasons,
the blitzkrieg--

00:26:30.830 --> 00:26:33.050
by definition the
lightning attack--

00:26:33.050 --> 00:26:34.604
was all about speed.

00:26:34.604 --> 00:26:36.770
And then you can start
thinking about why does speed

00:26:36.770 --> 00:26:38.030
help in wars?

00:26:38.030 --> 00:26:40.100
One of the reasons
that the Americans lost

00:26:40.100 --> 00:26:43.760
the war in Vietnam was
because of a lack of speed.

00:26:43.760 --> 00:26:48.760
On the other side, the Americans
won the Revolutionary War

00:26:48.760 --> 00:26:50.600
largely through speed.

00:26:50.600 --> 00:26:53.210
And when you start thinking
of topics in this way,

00:26:53.210 --> 00:26:55.310
making sure that you
learn in this way,

00:26:55.310 --> 00:26:58.905
it makes for a richer
sense of learning.

00:26:58.905 --> 00:27:07.070
I ended up spending some time
with an ER doctor at USF.

00:27:07.070 --> 00:27:09.800
And he's sort of a real
expert on problem solving.

00:27:09.800 --> 00:27:11.690
This is his thing.

00:27:11.690 --> 00:27:13.414
And I watched him.

00:27:13.414 --> 00:27:15.080
This was at a medical
school conference,

00:27:15.080 --> 00:27:17.710
but someone brought in a case.

00:27:17.710 --> 00:27:19.320
And it was a rare case.

00:27:19.320 --> 00:27:21.310
It was a man spitting up blood.

00:27:21.310 --> 00:27:25.040
And he gave some advice around
what is good problem solving.

00:27:25.040 --> 00:27:28.370
So one thing that
he said was, you

00:27:28.370 --> 00:27:31.790
need a one-sentence
description of the issue.

00:27:31.790 --> 00:27:34.554
You want something that
you're able to Google.

00:27:34.554 --> 00:27:36.470
Another bit of advice
that I thought was great

00:27:36.470 --> 00:27:39.190
was that you need to update
your background knowledge.

00:27:39.190 --> 00:27:41.370
So go visit the Wikipedia site.

00:27:41.370 --> 00:27:44.480
Make sure your
deep knowledge is--

00:27:44.480 --> 00:27:47.830
your long-term memory
is rich enough.

00:27:47.830 --> 00:27:50.600
No but the other
thing that ultimately

00:27:50.600 --> 00:27:52.850
is problem solving, at least
in this medical context--

00:27:52.850 --> 00:27:55.183
and really, when you think
about it, any form of problem

00:27:55.183 --> 00:27:57.080
solving-- it's a form
of pattern recognition.

00:27:57.080 --> 00:27:59.720
So he has in his mind
different kinds of scripts,

00:27:59.720 --> 00:28:01.610
mental models of diseases.

00:28:01.610 --> 00:28:04.850
And he is trying to match that
information, basically a form

00:28:04.850 --> 00:28:08.060
of analogical thinking,
to match that information

00:28:08.060 --> 00:28:14.870
with the information of the
patient that's in front of him.

00:28:14.870 --> 00:28:19.340
So we're going to go to the sort
of final lesson, as it were.

00:28:19.340 --> 00:28:21.890
And what then becomes
really important

00:28:21.890 --> 00:28:27.050
is the process of reviewing,
of reflecting, of revisiting.

00:28:27.050 --> 00:28:30.820
So here's another
quiz question for us.

00:28:30.820 --> 00:28:34.280
And the question is,
should a speaker,

00:28:34.280 --> 00:28:36.500
whether it's me or an educator--

00:28:36.500 --> 00:28:38.950
how long of a pause
should they give

00:28:38.950 --> 00:28:43.290
in a speech to allow people
to dwell on a big idea?

00:28:43.290 --> 00:28:46.520
So should they leave
one second, two seconds,

00:28:46.520 --> 00:28:47.960
or more than three seconds?

00:28:47.960 --> 00:28:51.880
So how long should
the pauses be when

00:28:51.880 --> 00:28:54.580
a speaker is asking an important
question, one second, two

00:28:54.580 --> 00:28:56.140
seconds, or more
than three seconds?

00:28:56.140 --> 00:28:57.040
I'm going to ask you.

00:28:57.040 --> 00:28:59.750
What do you think?

00:28:59.750 --> 00:29:00.850
No, here in the front.

00:29:04.510 --> 00:29:07.244
OK, we're going to go to
someone else, with the glasses.

00:29:07.244 --> 00:29:08.660
AUDIENCE: More
than three seconds.

00:29:08.660 --> 00:29:10.243
ULRICH BOSER: More
than three seconds.

00:29:12.830 --> 00:29:15.850
Let's just say that the research
study dates back to the 1980s,

00:29:15.850 --> 00:29:19.062
is actually between
three to five seconds.

00:29:19.062 --> 00:29:21.520
What's remarkable is that three
to five seconds is actually

00:29:21.520 --> 00:29:22.810
a pretty long time.

00:29:22.810 --> 00:29:24.310
Now, I give this
presentation a lot.

00:29:24.310 --> 00:29:28.420
And I talk about this quiz
item, but I actually don't even

00:29:28.420 --> 00:29:30.390
obey by the research itself.

00:29:30.390 --> 00:29:35.250
I have not waited three to five
seconds, though I should have,

00:29:35.250 --> 00:29:38.010
because for the presenter, it's
actually kind of uncomfortable.

00:29:38.010 --> 00:29:39.760
It's a good chunk of time.

00:29:39.760 --> 00:29:42.240
But when you look at really
good speakers, speakers

00:29:42.240 --> 00:29:44.910
who are much better than
me, like Barack Obama,

00:29:44.910 --> 00:29:48.940
if you watch him,
he speaks so slowly.

00:29:48.940 --> 00:29:51.210
And the idea there is
just people need time

00:29:51.210 --> 00:29:53.400
to digest this information.

00:29:53.400 --> 00:29:56.490
Now at first glance, it seems
like it's about working memory.

00:29:56.490 --> 00:29:57.510
And to a degree, it is.

00:29:57.510 --> 00:29:59.220
But there's another
thing happening here,

00:29:59.220 --> 00:30:03.240
and that is we often think that
our thoughts and our emotions

00:30:03.240 --> 00:30:06.690
are separate, or that our
body and reason are separate.

00:30:06.690 --> 00:30:08.610
But they're very connected.

00:30:08.610 --> 00:30:11.910
And so we need time to reflect.

00:30:11.910 --> 00:30:13.800
So another way to
think about this

00:30:13.800 --> 00:30:17.580
is, if I had two cell phones,
and they're the same cell

00:30:17.580 --> 00:30:18.220
phone--

00:30:18.220 --> 00:30:21.550
this is a nice study
that was done once--

00:30:21.550 --> 00:30:24.570
and I have one of
them the finger,

00:30:24.570 --> 00:30:28.570
and then I wave at the
same other cell phone,

00:30:28.570 --> 00:30:30.467
I will think that the
first cell phone--

00:30:30.467 --> 00:30:32.050
even though it's the
same cell phone--

00:30:32.050 --> 00:30:34.930
is a much worse cell phone.

00:30:34.930 --> 00:30:37.970
And so what happens is, my hand
giving my phone the finger--

00:30:37.970 --> 00:30:40.330
it did the thinking.

00:30:40.330 --> 00:30:41.480
My hand did the thinking.

00:30:41.480 --> 00:30:46.990
And then I used that
thinking, and engaged in it.

00:30:46.990 --> 00:30:51.910
So this is an incredible
thing when you think about it.

00:30:51.910 --> 00:30:53.860
Our hands aren't
supposed to think.

00:30:53.860 --> 00:30:56.420
Our bodies aren't
supposed to change the way

00:30:56.420 --> 00:30:59.860
that we reason in this way.

00:30:59.860 --> 00:31:01.780
And yet they do.

00:31:01.780 --> 00:31:05.140
And this explains-- and I
think in other contexts,

00:31:05.140 --> 00:31:06.640
we kind of know this idea.

00:31:06.640 --> 00:31:08.002
So in the creativity space--

00:31:08.002 --> 00:31:09.460
and people love to
talk about that,

00:31:09.460 --> 00:31:10.918
like you were in
the shower and you

00:31:10.918 --> 00:31:13.000
had that moment of recognition.

00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:15.970
But we need, then, the same
thing in the learning space.

00:31:15.970 --> 00:31:19.750
We need these times to reflect.

00:31:19.750 --> 00:31:23.310
We need these times to
process this information,

00:31:23.310 --> 00:31:25.510
and allow, in many
ways, our emotions

00:31:25.510 --> 00:31:28.870
to become attached to them.

00:31:28.870 --> 00:31:30.670
The other aspect of reflection--

00:31:30.670 --> 00:31:33.510
and we can do this ourselves,
this form of reflection.

00:31:33.510 --> 00:31:36.100
So some of it explains you
know why we want safety

00:31:36.100 --> 00:31:36.970
when we're learning.

00:31:36.970 --> 00:31:39.190
We see this is really
important in schools.

00:31:39.190 --> 00:31:42.040
This also explains why
moments of solitude

00:31:42.040 --> 00:31:44.590
can be really
important for learning.

00:31:44.590 --> 00:31:52.600
It also explains why just
even writing about something

00:31:52.600 --> 00:31:55.120
is a very powerful way to learn.

00:31:55.120 --> 00:31:58.210
And we see experts who
really hone on getting better

00:31:58.210 --> 00:31:59.020
at their craft.

00:31:59.020 --> 00:32:02.170
So Pat Metheny is a
famous jazz guitarist.

00:32:02.170 --> 00:32:04.300
Some of you might be
familiar with him--

00:32:04.300 --> 00:32:05.940
really one of the world's best.

00:32:05.940 --> 00:32:08.050
And after every
concert, he'll just

00:32:08.050 --> 00:32:10.930
spend a good chunk
of time just writing

00:32:10.930 --> 00:32:13.030
about what worked,
what didn't work,

00:32:13.030 --> 00:32:15.879
engaging in this
type of reflection.

00:32:15.879 --> 00:32:17.920
And the other thing about
this type of reflection

00:32:17.920 --> 00:32:20.930
is that it also allows
us to check our work.

00:32:20.930 --> 00:32:24.700
This allows us to engage in
kind of the meta-cognition

00:32:24.700 --> 00:32:30.360
and make sure that
we're not too confident.

00:32:30.360 --> 00:32:33.090
What's weird about
giving this type of talk

00:32:33.090 --> 00:32:36.900
is that the messages that
they often really boil down to

00:32:36.900 --> 00:32:39.690
are not ones that I think
many people want to hear.

00:32:39.690 --> 00:32:42.660
So one of them is that
learning isn't really fun.

00:32:42.660 --> 00:32:44.730
And when you see a
lot of games that

00:32:44.730 --> 00:32:49.170
promise you can learn
secretly, that learning

00:32:49.170 --> 00:32:52.230
is going to be fun, and
the research actually

00:32:52.230 --> 00:32:54.300
suggests that it's
the other way around.

00:32:54.300 --> 00:32:57.570
So one of the reasons that
interleaving is a powerful way

00:32:57.570 --> 00:32:59.520
to learn is that
it actually makes

00:32:59.520 --> 00:33:02.020
learning a little bit harder.

00:33:02.020 --> 00:33:04.950
And I think an alternative
way to think about this is

00:33:04.950 --> 00:33:06.730
a math professor at Princeton.

00:33:06.730 --> 00:33:08.350
And I was talking with him.

00:33:08.350 --> 00:33:09.960
And he was, like,
yeah, students today

00:33:09.960 --> 00:33:11.850
are always saying
learning is fun.

00:33:11.850 --> 00:33:15.690
The much better way to thinking
about it is that math is fun,

00:33:15.690 --> 00:33:17.640
and that's what makes it hard--

00:33:17.640 --> 00:33:21.330
excuse me, math is hard, and
that's what makes it fun.

00:33:21.330 --> 00:33:24.990
So that you're engaging in
these types of difficulties

00:33:24.990 --> 00:33:29.230
is actually what
makes it enjoyable.

00:33:29.230 --> 00:33:31.140
And to give other
examples of the way

00:33:31.140 --> 00:33:34.260
that this type of active
sort of harder processing--

00:33:34.260 --> 00:33:37.650
it's also just so easy to slip
in these more comfortable ways,

00:33:37.650 --> 00:33:39.930
whether we're using
highlighters or rereading.

00:33:39.930 --> 00:33:42.270
I had this experience myself
a few weeks ago, where

00:33:42.270 --> 00:33:44.310
I was preparing for a talk.

00:33:44.310 --> 00:33:47.250
And I like had my
notes in front of me.

00:33:47.250 --> 00:33:50.310
And I was just like, I
really wanted these notes.

00:33:50.310 --> 00:33:52.517
And I kept basically
rereading them.

00:33:52.517 --> 00:33:53.850
And they were comfortable to me.

00:33:53.850 --> 00:33:56.160
It was a topic I hadn't
spoken about a lot.

00:33:56.160 --> 00:33:59.370
And it was really the
opposite of better learning.

00:33:59.370 --> 00:34:04.020
I'm much better off putting
the material away, and engaging

00:34:04.020 --> 00:34:05.244
in that way.

00:34:05.244 --> 00:34:06.660
Another way to
think about this is

00:34:06.660 --> 00:34:08.940
sort of repeat-backs,
sort of a management tool.

00:34:08.940 --> 00:34:11.340
But it's essentially a
form of active learning.

00:34:11.340 --> 00:34:15.239
I've done it now
often with my wife.

00:34:15.239 --> 00:34:17.080
If you give someone
some instructions,

00:34:17.080 --> 00:34:20.159
and if they're more
complicated instructions,

00:34:20.159 --> 00:34:24.850
you want then to repeat that
information back to you.

00:34:24.850 --> 00:34:26.790
That's another way
of sort of engaging

00:34:26.790 --> 00:34:31.434
this form of active learning.

00:34:31.434 --> 00:34:33.600
I think the other thing
that's sort of the key theme

00:34:33.600 --> 00:34:36.389
here is, forgetting can
really be your friend.

00:34:36.389 --> 00:34:40.020
We often think that
forgetting works against us.

00:34:40.020 --> 00:34:44.090
But forgetting actually allows
us new forms of perspective.

00:34:44.090 --> 00:34:46.650
It allows us to engage
in more systems thinking.

00:34:46.650 --> 00:34:48.900
The key thing to also
understand about forgetting--

00:34:48.900 --> 00:34:50.691
and this is a weird
concept to understand--

00:34:50.691 --> 00:34:52.770
is that you actually
don't really forget.

00:34:52.770 --> 00:34:55.350
There are some fun studies
on this, that if I go to you

00:34:55.350 --> 00:34:58.022
and say, can you remember your
high school locker number,

00:34:58.022 --> 00:34:59.730
I think most people
would be, like, no, I

00:34:59.730 --> 00:35:00.840
can't remember that.

00:35:00.840 --> 00:35:06.414
But if I show you four options,
and of those, one of them

00:35:06.414 --> 00:35:07.830
is your high school
locker number,

00:35:07.830 --> 00:35:10.980
far more than one might
guess, and certainly

00:35:10.980 --> 00:35:12.660
a lot more than
average, you're actually

00:35:12.660 --> 00:35:15.510
able to identify that number.

00:35:15.510 --> 00:35:18.270
So the question is, if you are
able to remember everything,

00:35:18.270 --> 00:35:21.170
how do you actually
remember something?

00:35:21.170 --> 00:35:23.010
And to do that,
it's the retrieval.

00:35:23.010 --> 00:35:25.260
It's pulling things
out of memory

00:35:25.260 --> 00:35:27.360
that makes them more available.

00:35:27.360 --> 00:35:29.520
And this explains why
these more active types

00:35:29.520 --> 00:35:31.080
of learning, whether it's
explaining to yourself

00:35:31.080 --> 00:35:33.270
or explaining to someone
else, can be so effective.

00:35:33.270 --> 00:35:36.460
They allow you to see
these types of connections.

00:35:36.460 --> 00:35:38.730
But then again, they
allow you to have

00:35:38.730 --> 00:35:40.790
things sort of top of mind.

00:35:40.790 --> 00:35:42.720
They allow you to
exist with them.

00:35:42.720 --> 00:35:45.270
And I guess my parting
thought in this regard

00:35:45.270 --> 00:35:49.470
is always, always
look for patterns.

00:35:49.470 --> 00:35:54.450
It's so easy to look for this
very specific bit of detail.

00:35:54.450 --> 00:35:56.790
So if you're learning
about oceans as an example,

00:35:56.790 --> 00:36:00.660
you'd want to know what's
the temperature of the ocean.

00:36:00.660 --> 00:36:03.300
But if you're engaging in
these types of analogies,

00:36:03.300 --> 00:36:04.490
you're starting to think--

00:36:04.490 --> 00:36:06.990
or these types of
systems thinking-- you're

00:36:06.990 --> 00:36:09.390
going to say to yourself,
what happens when

00:36:09.390 --> 00:36:11.066
the water temperature goes up?

00:36:11.066 --> 00:36:13.440
One of the things that happens
is more vapor is produced.

00:36:13.440 --> 00:36:15.720
This helps us understand
why climate change can

00:36:15.720 --> 00:36:20.190
be so dangerous, because some
of the storms are more terrible.

00:36:20.190 --> 00:36:21.690
This also helps us,
then, understand

00:36:21.690 --> 00:36:25.200
why sea levels are rising,
because the relationship

00:36:25.200 --> 00:36:27.300
between heat and water
is such that water

00:36:27.300 --> 00:36:30.360
expands as it grows bigger.

00:36:30.360 --> 00:36:32.280
Analogies, though,
are difficult.

00:36:32.280 --> 00:36:35.370
And when you're using analogies,
using this type of systems

00:36:35.370 --> 00:36:38.120
thinking, you want to have
analogies that you know well,

00:36:38.120 --> 00:36:41.670
so the analogy of it cuts like
a knife works, because we're all

00:36:41.670 --> 00:36:43.800
pretty familiar with knives.

00:36:43.800 --> 00:36:45.420
And analogies in
this same regard

00:36:45.420 --> 00:36:48.180
is that if you're explaining
an idea to someone else--

00:36:48.180 --> 00:36:50.730
sort of like you might Uber
for kindergarten or Uber

00:36:50.730 --> 00:36:51.750
for cooking--

00:36:51.750 --> 00:36:55.920
you're using an analogy that
all of us are familiar with.

00:36:55.920 --> 00:36:58.470
And then the reverse side
is that these analogies that

00:36:58.470 --> 00:37:00.540
don't work are either
sort of quiz problems,

00:37:00.540 --> 00:37:01.800
or they're just plainly funny.

00:37:01.800 --> 00:37:03.591
And I'll leave you with
that thought, which

00:37:03.591 --> 00:37:07.770
is what do Barack Obama and Mt.

00:37:07.770 --> 00:37:10.000
Kilimanjaro have in common?

00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:11.940
It turns out to be Africa.

00:37:11.940 --> 00:37:14.520
So with that, I'm going
to thank you again

00:37:14.520 --> 00:37:18.570
for taking the time to come out
here today and listen to this.

00:37:18.570 --> 00:37:20.400
And thank you again.

00:37:20.400 --> 00:37:23.450
[APPLAUSE]
