Welcome to the lesson.

00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:05.020
When building your startup,
you need a way to finance everything.

00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:08.470
In this lesson, you'll learn some of the
options available to fund your business.

00:00:08.470 --> 00:00:12.570
We'll look into bootstrapping, loans,
angel investors, venture capitalists,

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:13.850
accelerators and incubators.

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:17.240
Each of these options have their
own benefits and downsides.

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:19.310
We'll spend some time
going over each of them.

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:20.940
You'll also hear from entrepreneurs and

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:24.110
investors about their experiences
financing their businesses.

00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:26.650
By the end of the lesson,
you'll be ready to decide which of these

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:29.130
options provide you the best
opportunity for your startup.
