00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:03.330
One super cool thing to me about
spectral partitioning is that you can

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:07.440
derive it using the graph laplacian
as it appears in a particular

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:09.020
physical system.

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:11.220
Imagine that you have a bunch
of sticks of infinite length.

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:15.680
Let's suppose the sticks
are fixed meaning they don't move.

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:17.790
This dashed line is just a reference.

00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:21.050
We're going to measure distances
relative to the reference.

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:24.090
And suppose each stick has
a weight attached to it.

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:26.720
And let's suppose each weight
has a mass of little m.

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:30.600
We're talking about a physical system so
the mass would be measured in, say,

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:31.840
kilograms.

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:35.490
And for simplicity, let's assume
all the weights have the same mass.

00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:39.250
Now imagine that you connect
these weights by springs so

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:42.120
then if you take all the weights and
you displace them by some amount

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.620
relative to one another,
the strings will stretch.

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:47.790
And the weights will move up and down.

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:51.250
So what I want us to do is study
the motion of these weights.

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:53.480
Let's zoom in on one of the weights.

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:54.970
Now, relative to the reference line,

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:59.330
weight i will be displaced by
some amount at any point in time.

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:02.170
Let's call this
displacement x of i of t.

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:05.250
Now, in Physics 101, you would have
analyzed the motion of these weights,

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:08.030
using Newton's laws and
Hooke's laws for springs.

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:10.120
Yaaar, did someone say springs?!

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:12.820
Here's a quick reminder.

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:15.560
Newton's Law says that the net
force acting on a object

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:19.090
causes it to accelerate in
linear proportion to its mass.

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:23.780
Hooke's Law says that the force
from a spring is proportional to

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:25.600
how much it stretched.

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:27.960
Hooke's Law holds if this
degree of stretching or

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.370
displacement is relatively small.

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:34.100
Now, if that all sounds like a bunch of
nonsensical mumbo jumbo, don't worry,

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:36.030
I'm not testing you on physics.

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:39.450
Just hang in there with me, and
I promise something neat will happen.

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.700
So let's go back to this ith weight.

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:45.590
Its motion is determined by
the net force acting on it.

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:46.600
By Hooke's Law,

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:50.700
that force will depend on how much
the strings are being stretched.

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:53.570
And in fact, each string will
be stretched by the difference

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:55.458
between the displacements of the masses.

00:01:55.458 --> 00:01:59.540
So, the right-hand side is
just the sum of these forces.

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:02.310
Now, rewriting the right-hand
side you'll get the following.

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:04.620
Notice the values of the coefficients.

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:08.199
So, the net force acting on
a given mass is proportional to

00:02:08.199 --> 00:02:10.500
the displacements of its neighbors.

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:13.100
In fact,
I can rewrite this entire system for

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:17.100
all the masses as a system
of differential equations.

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:19.090
Let's define a vector x arrow,

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:22.240
whose components are all
the springs displacements.

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:24.840
Then the entire system of differential
equations can be written in

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:26.400
the following form.

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:29.500
I've used matrix notation here to
express the entire system very

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:30.920
compactly.

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:33.860
So, does this matrix look familiar?

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:36.570
Why it's nothing more
than a graph laplacian.

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:40.030
In particular, it's the graph
laplacian for a line graph.

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:41.240
I know what you're thinking,

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:45.280
okay Vudoc, what on God's green earth
does this have to do with partitioning?

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:47.680
Therein lies the neat surprise.

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:50.970
Start by asking yourself what would
the motion of this system of weights and

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:52.610
springs look like?

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:55.420
The top plot is the displacement
of all the weights.

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:59.820
Every weight is a dot and the springs
are the solid lines connecting the dots.

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:03.770
The bottom plot will show you
the velocity of all of the weights.

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:07.890
At the beginning suppose we give
a little kick to the middle weight so

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:11.220
that its velocity is one unit
of distance per unit of time and

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:13.960
the other weights are at
rest with velocity zero.

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:17.010
That's how you read the initial
picture shown in the bottom plot.

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:18.940
So from this starting point,
let's see what happens.

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:24.450
Notice how the springs are bobbing up
and down with a kind of wavy motion.

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:26.940
In fact,
this motion can always be described

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:29.550
as a sum of fundamental displacements.

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:31.080
Which are basically sines and

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:34.300
cosine curves at various
fundamental frequencies or modes.

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:37.250
If you have a background in music,
you know about harmonics,

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:40.720
and harmonics are modes for
say, vibrating strings.

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:44.490
Now for this particular spring system,
it turns out that the fundamental modes

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:47.850
are given by the eigenvectors
of the graph laplacian.

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:50.990
In fact, when we finally arrive
at our ultimate algorithm for

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:54.760
spectral partitioning, you'll be taking
a closer look at the eigenvectors.

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:55.670
But more on that later.
