00:11:05.151 --> 00:11:07.151
On behalf of all my  colleagues,

Tonight is the third in what has
become the annual celebration of

00:11:25.222 --> 00:11:27.474
the prize for and its winners.

00:11:30.941 --> 00:11:33.173
We all find pleasure in today's 
hectic world to pause and take 

00:11:33.174 --> 00:11:37.863
an evening to recognize the 
power of literature to change 

00:11:37.864 --> 00:11:39.864
our perceptions.

00:11:42.175 --> 00:11:44.841
Along with our poet lar yet, the
prize for American fiction 

00:11:44.842 --> 00:11:46.842
stands as the 

00:11:47.920 --> 00:11:49.920
Library's highest honor to an 
American writer.

00:11:51.589 --> 00:11:54.254
It seeks to come mend strong, 
unique, enduring voices who have

00:11:54.255 --> 00:11:58.961
told us something new about the 
American experience.

00:12:02.026 --> 00:12:04.026
Denis Johnson certainly deserves
the 

00:12:05.292 --> 00:12:08.132
honor, as last year's prize 
winner Marilyn Robinson has said

00:12:08.133 --> 00:12:10.133
about him:  I 

00:12:11.187 --> 00:12:14.022
have known a writer who was so 
identical with his work, whose 

00:12:14.023 --> 00:12:16.023
thoughts and  

00:12:17.704 --> 00:12:19.753
passions and nrks were so 
entirely of one substance with 

00:12:19.754 --> 00:12:23.840
the world he remade as fiction. 
The great energy of his 

00:12:23.841 --> 00:12:28.953
imagination was a fusion of 
honesty and seriousness, pain 

00:12:28.954 --> 00:12:31.214
and laughter.  His life was a 
thing of the moment and 

00:12:35.500 --> 00:12:40.400
urgency, pure and undistracted. 
Denis left us too soon.  But we 

00:12:40.401 --> 00:12:43.070
have an amazing group of his 
writing peers, literary and 

00:12:43.071 --> 00:12:47.151
journalistic here with us 
tonight to help celebrate his 

00:12:47.152 --> 00:12:49.373
life and work.  It should be a 
fascinating discussion 

00:12:52.843 --> 00:12:54.843
that reflects in strikingly 
different 

00:12:55.930 --> 00:12:58.380
ways the gritty themes that 
course through his  stories.

00:13:01.439 --> 00:13:03.439
Before we get started I would 
like to 

00:13:04.902 --> 00:13:07.350
recognize Cindy Johnson, his 
widow and his  daughter, Lara 

00:13:07.351 --> 00:13:10.200
Burke.  We are glad you so join 
us this evening.

00:13:14.494 --> 00:13:16.494
I would also like to recognize 
Avida, 

00:13:17.534 --> 00:13:19.985
the deputy publisher of Random 
House, the proud publisher of 

00:13:19.986 --> 00:13:22.251
Denis' work.
   Now, please let me welcome my

00:13:25.696 --> 00:13:28.568
colleague, John  Haskell to the 
stage to tell you a bit about 

00:13:28.569 --> 00:13:30.569
one of our hosts 

00:13:33.259 --> 00:13:34.274
this evening, the J1 Kluge 
center here at the Library.  

00:13:34.275 --> 00:13:36.275
Thank you.

00:13:39.762 --> 00:13:43.067
)
   »:  Thank you, Jane and thank

00:13:43.068 --> 00:13:45.068
you all for  coming.

00:13:46.928 --> 00:13:50.212
The Kluge center is proud to be 
cosponsor of this event.  It is 

00:13:50.213 --> 00:13:53.055
a continuation of a 
collaboration we have had with 

00:13:53.056 --> 00:13:57.769
the Poetry &amp; Literature Center 
to celebrate the winners and the

00:13:57.770 --> 00:14:00.830
prize for American fiction.  The
tribute to this particular 

00:14:03.884 --> 00:14:06.328
literary giant fits perfectly 
into the Kluge center emission 

00:14:06.329 --> 00:14:08.329
which is to be a bridge between 
scholars and writers on 

00:14:11.665 --> 00:14:12.483
the one hand and policymakers 
and the interested public on the

00:14:12.484 --> 00:14:15.538
other.
   That is to foster a 

00:14:15.539 --> 00:14:20.199
continuing conversation of the 
challenges facing democracies in

00:14:20.200 --> 00:14:22.236
the 21st century.
   Before we get to the program 

00:14:22.237 --> 00:14:26.775
I want to give a quick shout-out
to the national endowment for 

00:14:26.776 --> 00:14:28.776
the humanities 

00:14:30.442 --> 00:14:32.884
who has gotten the word out to a
lot of you about this event and 

00:14:32.885 --> 00:14:35.717
also to thank them for the work 
they do in collaboration with 

00:14:35.718 --> 00:14:37.718
the Library.

00:14:39.214 --> 00:14:41.214
Right now we have a brief video 

00:14:44.652 --> 00:14:46.652
featuring Denis Johnson.

00:14:48.740 --> 00:14:54.536
»:  DenisEnglish words are like 
prisms, empty, nothing inside.  

00:14:54.537 --> 00:14:57.203
Until they make rainbows.  So 
says a character in already dead

00:14:57.204 --> 00:15:00.065
a novel by the late great 
American writer, Denis Johnson.

00:15:03.963 --> 00:15:05.963
Johnson's stories as ledges of 
his fans know are also prisms.

00:15:10.962 --> 00:15:13.594
They are hard, mercy less, 
Flinty and yet they too make 

00:15:13.595 --> 00:15:15.595
rainbows.

00:15:18.279 --> 00:15:20.318
He has been called a writer's, 
writer's writer.  They hold a 

00:15:20.319 --> 00:15:25.527
simple truth.  Those who bring 
language to life recognize 

00:15:25.528 --> 00:15:27.528
Johnson's  gifts instantly.

00:15:29.213 --> 00:15:31.213
His work has been called 
profound and transsent dent.

00:15:33.270 --> 00:15:35.270
Jonathan Franz finds his words 
miracles of tone.

00:15:38.781 --> 00:15:40.781
Philip Roth calls him  
terrifying, 

00:15:42.042 --> 00:15:44.042
emissary for tortured broken 
souls.

00:15:45.517 --> 00:15:47.517
Marilyn Robinson marvels at his 

00:15:48.576 --> 00:15:52.030
energies, so inextricably we 
haded to his words.  All agree 

00:15:52.031 --> 00:15:54.031
Denis Johnson has managed to 

00:15:56.947 --> 00:15:58.947
give us minimalist yet 
distinctly 

00:16:01.015 --> 00:16:03.015
ecstatic and hallucinatory 
rainbow  prose.

00:16:06.174 --> 00:16:08.206
He is an American original, born
in Germany and raised in manila 

00:16:08.207 --> 00:16:10.207
La.

00:16:12.032 --> 00:16:15.804
As a teenager moving back to 
Washington, D.C. he came to know

00:16:15.805 --> 00:16:18.655
the country and the characters 
he would capture so vividly in 

00:16:18.656 --> 00:16:20.699
fiction.  He graduated from the 
University of 

00:16:23.950 --> 00:16:26.235
Iowa and eferred MFA from the 
Iowa writer's workshop where he 

00:16:26.236 --> 00:16:28.264
returned as a teacher.  He 
taught at Texas State University

00:16:31.166 --> 00:16:33.166
and University of Texas, Austin.

00:16:34.214 --> 00:16:36.214
In the course of his fevered 
career 

00:16:37.465 --> 00:16:39.465
he published novels, short 
stories, journalism and poetry.

00:16:43.810 --> 00:16:45.810
Among the best known work are 
those 

00:16:48.294 --> 00:16:50.294
about flotsam and jetsom, tree 
of smoke, 

00:16:52.970 --> 00:16:54.970
nobody move, already dead, 
Jesus' son, 

00:16:57.237 --> 00:17:00.713
resuscitation of a hanged man.  
Angels.  He received numerous 

00:17:00.714 --> 00:17:02.714
awards for these including a 
National Book Award, a 

00:17:07.049 --> 00:17:09.726
Lannan fellowship in fiction, 
writing award and 2008 he was 

00:17:09.727 --> 00:17:14.019
named a finalist for the 
Pulitzer prize.  Throughout his 

00:17:14.020 --> 00:17:16.020
chronicles in America 

00:17:17.689 --> 00:17:19.689
that has gone unobserved, 
unrecorded, 

00:17:22.362 --> 00:17:24.806
here are our drug addicts, war 
veterans, disaffected, used up 

00:17:24.807 --> 00:17:26.858
and left behind.
   The most affecting and 

00:17:26.859 --> 00:17:28.859
rewarding 

00:17:30.737 --> 00:17:33.372
aspect of Denis Johnson' fiction
is that in work after work he 

00:17:33.373 --> 00:17:35.373
proved that beauty 

00:17:36.436 --> 00:17:38.459
often lurks in unexpected  
places, that strength can be 

00:17:38.460 --> 00:17:41.334
found in failure, that the human
spirit is a fragile but 

00:17:42.764 --> 00:17:45.810
resilient vessel.  His is a very
American story.

00:17:48.706 --> 00:17:50.952
He once described his works as 
pressure cookers of language, 

00:17:50.953 --> 00:17:52.953
his 

00:17:54.853 --> 00:17:56.853
characters as those who inhabit 
life's perilous edge.

00:17:59.537 --> 00:18:01.600
He found he himself was too vol 
ner ability rable to human 

00:18:01.601 --> 00:18:03.601
frailties.

00:18:05.086 --> 00:18:07.534
When Carla Hayden offered Denis 
Johnson the price for American 

00:18:07.535 --> 00:18:09.535
fiction 

00:18:10.597 --> 00:18:13.436
in March of 2017 he wrote in an 
email message:  My head is 

00:18:13.437 --> 00:18:16.501
spinning from such great news.  
Two months later, tragically, he

00:18:16.502 --> 00:18:18.502
was dead.

00:18:21.198 --> 00:18:23.855
The Library is very proud to 
honor posthumously this 

00:18:23.856 --> 00:18:26.308
extraordinary human beeping and 
writer whose contributions 

00:18:30.181 --> 00:18:32.181
to the American canon are 
invaluable.

00:18:33.849 --> 00:18:36.080
As it was noted when the prize 
was announced in 2017, Denis 

00:18:36.081 --> 00:18:38.529
Johnson was a writer for our 
time, in proceeds that 

00:18:42.639 --> 00:18:44.639
feels graced with grit he spun 
tale 

00:18:45.889 --> 00:18:47.889
after tale about demons, the 
salvation we seek.

00:18:49.156 --> 00:18:50.973
We emerge from his imaged world 
with profound empathy, a 

00:18:50.974 --> 00:18:52.974
different perspective, a little 
changed.

00:18:54.639 --> 00:18:57.103
We are very proud to count Denis
Johnson among the distinguished 

00:18:57.104 --> 00:19:00.571
winners of the Library of 
Congress Prize for American 

00:19:00.572 --> 00:19:03.837

00:20:25.475 --> 00:20:27.722
The purpose of that award is 
spelled out on the back of your 

00:20:27.723 --> 00:20:29.723
programs.

00:20:31.376 --> 00:20:33.376
It is to commend strong, unique,

00:20:34.451 --> 00:20:36.068
enduring voices that throughout 
long consistently accomplished 

00:20:36.069 --> 00:20:38.069
careers have 

00:20:39.136 --> 00:20:41.136
told us something new about the 
American experience.

00:20:45.841 --> 00:20:47.841
Past awardees have been her man 
Wouk, 

00:20:52.565 --> 00:20:54.565
is bell Allende, Don Delillo, 
John 

00:20:56.440 --> 00:20:58.440
Grisham, Marilyn Robinson, and 
Toni Morrison.

00:21:01.311 --> 00:21:03.340
The choice of our 1010th prize 
winner, Denis Johnson, made by  

00:21:03.341 --> 00:21:08.845
Dr. Hayden in March of last year
and then confirmed in a prize 

00:21:08.846 --> 00:21:10.846
ceremony in 

00:21:11.898 --> 00:21:13.898
September, was especially 
thrilling for 

00:21:14.938 --> 00:21:16.938
me as I have been a dedicated 
fan of 

00:21:18.196 --> 00:21:20.009
Denis' work since I stumbled on 
to resuscitation of a hanged man

00:21:20.010 --> 00:21:23.888
back in the early '90s when I 
was a little younger than I am 

00:21:23.889 --> 00:21:25.889
now.

00:21:27.764 --> 00:21:29.764
I found myself  bowled over by 
his 

00:21:30.811 --> 00:21:32.811
language, its emotional force, 
its precision.

00:21:37.544 --> 00:21:39.544
As one reviewer wrote, "his 
novels, 

00:21:40.788 --> 00:21:42.829
like poems, seem to be written 
line to line."

00:21:48.128 --> 00:21:50.573
But the full power of his 
stories transcends even his 

00:21:50.574 --> 00:21:52.574
proceeds mastery.

00:21:54.637 --> 00:21:57.540
Denis' stories land like a 
switch punch, somewhere between 

00:21:57.541 --> 00:22:01.392
gut and heart.  The last time I 
spoke to Denis it was on the 

00:22:01.393 --> 00:22:03.393
phone.

00:22:04.452 --> 00:22:07.090
Trying to persuade him to be 
here tonight.  He had been so 

00:22:07.091 --> 00:22:11.559
delighted by Dr. Hayden's call 
and the news that he was the 

00:22:11.560 --> 00:22:15.634
chosen honoree.  I exchanged 
emails with him just after that 

00:22:15.635 --> 00:22:17.635
call.

00:22:19.315 --> 00:22:22.378
But he was also an immensely 
private man.  He didn't like 

00:22:22.379 --> 00:22:26.229
public expressions of 
admiration.  Indeed he had been 

00:22:26.230 --> 00:22:28.230
conveniently away 

00:22:30.109 --> 00:22:32.962
in some war zone reporting a 
story when the National Book 

00:22:32.963 --> 00:22:35.826
Award was conferred on him ten 
years before for his 

00:22:38.465 --> 00:22:40.465
devastatingly powerful work 
"Tree of Smoke".

00:22:42.975 --> 00:22:44.594
I tried Valiantly to argue my 
case that he should join us 

00:22:44.595 --> 00:22:48.507
here.  That he didn't need to do
much.  Just come, sit out there 

00:22:48.508 --> 00:22:53.627
in the audience with all of you 
and be lauded and celebrated and

00:22:53.628 --> 00:22:56.267
given his due for being one of 
the great American literary 

00:22:57.277 --> 00:23:01.349
figures of our time.
   He was polite.  He was 

00:23:01.350 --> 00:23:03.350
friendly.

00:23:04.616 --> 00:23:06.616
He let me talk and talk.
   (Chuckles.

00:23:07.843 --> 00:23:10.098
)
   »:  That phone call which 

00:23:10.099 --> 00:23:14.979
lasts a good long while and I 
felt every passing minute that 

00:23:14.980 --> 00:23:16.980
my  powers of persuasion were 
failing me.

00:23:19.038 --> 00:23:21.571
It ended with:  Hmm, I don't 
think so.

00:23:19.038 --> 00:23:21.694
(Laughter.)
   » MARIE ARANA:  He just 

00:23:21.695 --> 00:23:23.695
couldn't bring himself to do it.

00:23:27.238 --> 00:23:29.238
That was on May 18th, 2017.

00:23:30.693 --> 00:23:32.693
Six days later, he was gone.

00:23:34.364 --> 00:23:36.364
Now we are here, gathering to 
honor 

00:23:37.839 --> 00:23:39.839
him in his absence.

00:23:43.751 --> 00:23:45.751
Thinking about how to best 
celebrate 

00:23:47.850 --> 00:23:49.850
denyness, we decided what might 
prees 

00:23:51.298 --> 00:23:52.932
him most given his gym let eyed 
view of public expressions of 

00:23:52.933 --> 00:23:54.972
admiration might be to turn our 
lights in the other direction.

00:23:59.244 --> 00:24:01.890
We decided to pay tribute to him
by honoring others in his name, 

00:24:01.891 --> 00:24:06.994
choosing three exemplary 
American writers whose works 

00:24:06.995 --> 00:24:08.995
reflect in one way or another 
the 

00:24:10.246 --> 00:24:13.500
themes that are so present in 
Denis' work.  They would be 

00:24:13.501 --> 00:24:15.972
excellent writers at the top of 
their form, very different 

00:24:18.621 --> 00:24:20.621
practitioners of the craft, 
three greats 

00:24:22.085 --> 00:24:24.085
who like Denis tell stories, 
fiction or 

00:24:25.089 --> 00:24:27.230
nonfiction.  Excuse me.

00:24:30.315 --> 00:24:32.751
Stories of the fallen world.  
The human cost of addiction, for

00:24:33.612 --> 00:24:35.612
instance.

00:24:36.659 --> 00:24:38.659
The terrible fog of war.

00:24:40.356 --> 00:24:42.356
The essential alienation and 

00:24:43.404 --> 00:24:46.276
disconnectedness that defines 
modern day America.  If we do 

00:24:46.277 --> 00:24:48.730
this right, tonight you will see
a little bit of Denis and his 

00:24:52.403 --> 00:24:54.440
obsessions in all three of these
brilliant words Smiths.

00:24:56.680 --> 00:24:58.680
I would like to tell you 
something 

00:24:59.739 --> 00:25:02.589
about each right up front, right
here before we sit down in 

00:25:02.590 --> 00:25:06.271
reverse order of their 
appearance.  When I actually 

00:25:06.272 --> 00:25:08.272
bring them on, the last shall be
the first.

00:25:10.743 --> 00:25:12.978
Let me start in that spirit with
someone who will actually follow

00:25:12.979 --> 00:25:14.979
the writers.

00:25:18.054 --> 00:25:20.054
She is Elizabeth Cuthrell, an 

00:25:21.737 --> 00:25:23.737
accomplished film producer who 
produced 

00:25:26.221 --> 00:25:28.221
Jesus' son, that stark, serge, 
offer 

00:25:29.469 --> 00:25:31.698
51ly, quirkily funny collection 
of stories for which Denis is 

00:25:31.699 --> 00:25:33.699
probably best 

00:25:38.003 --> 00:25:40.003
known, Elizabeth is founder of 
Evenstar 

00:25:41.054 --> 00:25:42.870
films, she turned out many 
movies as well as acclaimed 

00:25:42.871 --> 00:25:45.712
theater productions on both  
coasts.  She produced a stunning

00:25:45.713 --> 00:25:49.586
series of public service 
announcements called stop the 

00:25:49.587 --> 00:25:53.860
hate.  Urging racial tolerance 
for which she won the courage 

00:25:53.861 --> 00:25:55.861
award.

00:25:58.748 --> 00:25:59.793
We are especially thankful and 
very grateful to Elizabeth for 

00:25:59.794 --> 00:26:01.794
coming to 

00:26:03.251 --> 00:26:05.489
share with us Herlong time 
friendship with Denis Johnson.

00:26:10.607 --> 00:26:12.607
Sam Quinones is the author of 
dream 

00:26:13.882 --> 00:26:15.882
land, a true master piece of 

00:26:17.535 --> 00:26:19.535
investigative journalism about 
the IDEA 

00:26:20.995 --> 00:26:22.995
crisis that has ravaged small 
town America and the heart land.

00:26:24.844 --> 00:26:26.844
His book is powerful, absorbing,

00:26:28.115 --> 00:26:30.575
urgent, a monumental achievement
that drills down on the harsh 

00:26:30.576 --> 00:26:33.274
realities that Denis described 
so memorablely in fiction.

00:26:36.931 --> 00:26:38.758
The winner of the national book 
critic award, finalist for the 

00:26:38.759 --> 00:26:41.194
L.A. times book prize and named 
one of the 

00:26:45.268 --> 00:26:47.268
best books of 2015, it is a book
every American should read.

00:26:51.207 --> 00:26:54.057
A book that tracks a spiraling 
drug trade, voracious, 

00:26:54.058 --> 00:26:56.058
unfettered pharmaceutical 
industry, and hundreds of 

00:26:58.330 --> 00:27:00.330
thousands of lives strewn along 
the  way.

00:27:02.009 --> 00:27:04.009
We are very lucky to have Sam 
with us tonight.

00:27:05.860 --> 00:27:07.860

har owing, brutal utterly 
absorbing

novel about an Afghan orphan 
trapped in 

00:27:36.888 --> 00:27:38.888
the savage fog of wall.  His 
second novel "Dark at the 

00:27:41.787 --> 00:27:43.787
Crossing" published last year is
about a 

00:27:45.503 --> 00:27:47.503
young Arab American caught in 
the Syrian con Florida gracious.

00:27:48.795 --> 00:27:50.846
A finalist for the National Book
Award and named one of the best 

00:27:50.847 --> 00:27:52.847
books of 2017.

about Eden, a veteran home from 
the world,.

00:28:07.131 --> 00:28:09.591
Great to have you here.
   Our first guest tonight, 

00:28:09.592 --> 00:28:14.678
Jonathan Franzen is renowned for
plumbing the depths of the 

00:28:14.679 --> 00:28:16.679
modern American psyche, 

00:28:19.577 --> 00:28:22.215
past master of the essential 
loneliness that permeates 

00:28:22.216 --> 00:28:25.062
contemporary life and the wild 
careening twists of fate that 

00:28:25.063 --> 00:28:28.737
can throw it all out of whack 
and send it spinning.

00:28:31.782 --> 00:28:33.782
Jon's talent for forming 
striking 

00:28:35.642 --> 00:28:37.642
narratives out of ordinary life 
is a bun 

00:28:39.098 --> 00:28:41.098
daptly evident in his work, in 
his 

00:28:42.154 --> 00:28:44.154
richly imaged novel, "Purity", 
called 

00:28:45.419 --> 00:28:47.419
his most fleet footed intimate 
novel yet.

00:28:48.676 --> 00:28:51.536
If some authors are masters of 
suspense, others post modern 

00:28:51.537 --> 00:28:53.537
verb 

00:28:54.802 --> 00:28:56.802
balance Acrobats, publishers  
weekly 

00:28:59.136 --> 00:29:01.136
wrote and still other character 
point 

00:29:03.414 --> 00:29:06.245
Lisas, few Excel in all three 
arenas.  Jon is the author of 

00:29:06.246 --> 00:29:10.942
four other novels, among them 
freedom and "Corrections" for 

00:29:10.943 --> 00:29:13.186
which he won a nationality book 
award and other prize 

00:29:19.315 --> 00:29:21.315
Z, nine other works of fiction 
and nonfiction.

00:29:23.802 --> 00:29:25.219
Ladies and gentlemen, please 
welcome Jonathan Franzen.

00:29:25.220 --> 00:29:27.220
(Applause.

00:29:28.233 --> 00:29:30.233
)

00:29:33.449 --> 00:29:36.094
   »:  I would like.
   » MARIE ARANA:  I would like 

00:29:36.095 --> 00:29:40.589
to start with a quote, Jon.  Can
I be heard?  Yes?

00:29:44.063 --> 00:29:46.063
This is from Sam townhouse of 
the New York  Times.

00:29:49.955 --> 00:29:52.804
He said Franz cracks open the 
shell of post modernism, tweaks 

00:29:52.805 --> 00:29:57.701
out the circuitry and inserts in
its place the warm beating heart

00:29:57.702 --> 00:29:59.702
of an authentic humanism.

00:30:01.354 --> 00:30:01.564
» JONATHAN FRANZEN:  That was 
nice of Sam.

00:30:01.565 --> 00:30:06.052
(Laughter.)
   » MARIE ARANA:  He writes 

00:30:06.053 --> 00:30:11.321
with equal fluency on equity 
finance, railroad engineering, 

00:30:11.322 --> 00:30:13.322
currency manipulation in 

00:30:14.994 --> 00:30:17.029
Eastern Europe, neuro chemistry 
of deprigs, but the data flows 

00:30:17.030 --> 00:30:19.030
through the 

00:30:20.292 --> 00:30:22.292
arteries of narrative, attending
to the 

00:30:23.793 --> 00:30:25.238
quite drama of life and fraught 
transactions with the public 

00:30:25.239 --> 00:30:27.881
world.
   That is a pretty big, tall 

00:30:27.882 --> 00:30:32.362
order.
   Jon, you write about 

00:30:32.363 --> 00:30:34.363
dysfunctional 

00:30:35.831 --> 00:30:38.468
families, small American worlds 
that are exploded, really by 

00:30:38.469 --> 00:30:41.313
large events.  I think I can 
summarize your work that way.

00:30:48.659 --> 00:30:50.659
And the hum drum of quiet lives 

00:30:52.307 --> 00:30:54.307
suddenly ripped to sleds by 
economic 

00:30:56.393 --> 00:30:59.622
events or miscommunication or 
happenstance.  What brings you 

00:30:59.623 --> 00:31:01.623
to those subjects?

00:31:03.712 --> 00:31:06.574
   (Laughter.)
   » JONATHAN FRANZEN:  Sheer 

00:31:06.967 --> 00:31:11.861
desperation.  That's kind of 
what you face every morning in 

00:31:11.862 --> 00:31:13.862
the office.

00:31:16.335 --> 00:31:18.335
First of all, thank you all for 
coming.

00:31:19.809 --> 00:31:22.060
I never do these things.  
There's only one writer I would 

00:31:22.061 --> 00:31:24.097
have done this for and that is 
Denis Johnson 

00:31:29.814 --> 00:31:31.856
because he has a unique place, 
actually, in the world of 

00:31:31.857 --> 00:31:33.857
American literature.

00:31:34.910 --> 00:31:36.910
He is the one writer to every 
writer I 

00:31:38.996 --> 00:31:41.660
know can quote multiple lines 
from verbatim.  They are often 

00:31:41.661 --> 00:31:44.304
very funny lines which is 
something I hope we don't lose 

00:31:44.305 --> 00:31:47.970
sight of.  Denis was one of the 
funniest writers we had.

00:31:51.027 --> 00:31:53.065
Laugh out loud funny precisely 
because he was so close to the 

00:31:53.066 --> 00:31:55.066
will edge.

00:31:56.939 --> 00:31:58.968
So it is an honor to be here and
I'm so glad Cindy can be here 

00:31:58.969 --> 00:32:00.969
too.

00:32:03.656 --> 00:32:11.667
So, oh, yeah, my work.  Hmm.  
Whew.  It is auto biographical.

00:32:14.311 --> 00:32:17.775
It is just to get at the stuff 
that I'm interested in.  I am 

00:32:17.776 --> 00:32:19.830
very bad at writing about 
myself.  I think there are two 

00:32:19.831 --> 00:32:24.306
kinds of writers, one who can 
pretty much only write about 

00:32:24.307 --> 00:32:26.773
himself and her seven and the 
other kind.  And I'm the other 

00:32:26.774 --> 00:32:28.774
kind.

00:32:32.063 --> 00:32:34.063
Than and I like a good story.

00:32:38.999 --> 00:32:41.233
And typically good stories are 
about characters who want stuff 

00:32:41.234 --> 00:32:44.286
and also if they are anxious, 
then the story might be funny.

00:32:47.589 --> 00:32:49.818
And if I'm not laughing, then I 
am just setting those pages 

00:32:49.819 --> 00:32:51.819
aside and trying something  
else.

00:32:55.327 --> 00:32:57.327
And I guess, yes, and I always 
paid attention to the news.

00:33:01.021 --> 00:33:03.021
I had a dad who was very attuned
to -- 

00:33:04.479 --> 00:33:06.479
he had no education really 
except as a 

00:33:07.526 --> 00:33:09.526
civil engineer, but he thought 
about stuff.

00:33:10.995 --> 00:33:13.636
And dinner table conversation 
when I was growing up would be 

00:33:13.637 --> 00:33:16.126
about what was happening in the 
world.  So that just seemed 

00:33:16.127 --> 00:33:19.841
natural.  Also it is nice if you
have a character who wants 

00:33:19.842 --> 00:33:21.842
something, to put 

00:33:23.312 --> 00:33:25.312
that character in a recognizable
world.

00:33:26.603 --> 00:33:31.274
It just seems like, you know, 
it's what I do.  That was a sort

00:33:31.275 --> 00:33:35.761
of inarticulate response, but 
the articulate response would 

00:33:35.762 --> 00:33:37.762
eat up the rest of our time
   (Laughter.)

00:33:38.831 --> 00:33:40.831
» MARIE ARANA:  Well, you are 
pretty 

00:33:42.331 --> 00:33:44.567
articulate on the page, Jon.
   » JONATHAN FRANZEN:  Where it

00:33:44.568 --> 00:33:46.568
counts!
   (Laughter.)

00:33:46.820 --> 00:33:48.820
» MARIE ARANA:  Where it counts.

00:33:52.505 --> 00:33:54.533
But you really do, I think, more
than many American writers who 

00:33:54.534 --> 00:33:56.534
are dealing 

00:34:01.686 --> 00:34:03.686
perhaps with, you know, plot 
driven or 

00:34:07.406 --> 00:34:09.406
shall we say small domestic 
troubles, 

00:34:12.534 --> 00:34:14.159
that there is a sense when you 
read Jonathan Franzen that you 

00:34:14.160 --> 00:34:16.160
are reading 

00:34:17.415 --> 00:34:19.415
something about this anxious 
age, 

00:34:22.318 --> 00:34:24.318
something about a kind of loss 
of 

00:34:26.826 --> 00:34:29.485
connectivity that we seem to 
have come to.  At least that's 

00:34:29.486 --> 00:34:31.921
what the critics say.
   What do you say from your 

00:34:31.922 --> 00:34:33.948
perch?  About what you are 
trying to do?

00:34:38.020 --> 00:34:41.673
   » JONATHAN FRANZEN:  
Honestly, I am trying to be 

00:34:41.674 --> 00:34:44.116
funny and I find people who are 
anxious very funny because I 

00:34:44.117 --> 00:34:48.810
feel that's the only way to 
survive my own anxiety is to 

00:34:48.811 --> 00:34:50.852
step back and throw it into 
somebody else and then laugh at 

00:34:51.261 --> 00:34:53.261
that person.

00:34:56.381 --> 00:34:58.381
So, for instance, like in the 

00:35:00.265 --> 00:35:02.733
"Corrections", I spent -- I was 
looking for a topic sentence, 

00:35:02.734 --> 00:35:05.995
just a little craft thing.  I 
don't really have a character 

00:35:05.996 --> 00:35:10.866
until I can write a good topic 
sentence about the character.  

00:35:10.867 --> 00:35:13.100
It all goes back to what we were
taught in seventh grade about 

00:35:13.101 --> 00:35:17.777
topic sentences.  It turns out 
to be really true.  It can take 

00:35:17.778 --> 00:35:19.778
up to five years to come up with
a topic sentence for a character

00:35:20.418 --> 00:35:22.418
for me.
   (Chuckles.)

00:35:23.483 --> 00:35:25.910
» JONATHAN FRANZEN:  But there 
was a character in the 

00:35:25.911 --> 00:35:30.795
"Corrections", Gary, and it was 
an elaborate topic sentence but 

00:35:30.796 --> 00:35:32.796
it had to do with, there was all

00:35:33.858 --> 00:35:35.858
this attention in the '90s on 
clinical depression.

00:35:39.561 --> 00:35:41.561
Which Prozac was the miracle 
cure for.

00:35:45.261 --> 00:35:47.115
And he was basically trying to 
demonstrate that he was not -- 

00:35:47.116 --> 00:35:50.975
he was trying to do something in
order to demonstrate to his wife

00:35:50.976 --> 00:35:55.056
that he was not clinically 
depressed.  That was very much 

00:35:55.057 --> 00:36:00.340
of the time.  People were having
conversations -- instead of 

00:36:00.341 --> 00:36:02.778
saying I wish you would take the
trash out or clean up after 

00:36:02.779 --> 00:36:07.078
dinner more they would say you 
have a problem.  You are 

00:36:07.079 --> 00:36:09.342
clinically depressed and the 
other person would say no, I'm 

00:36:09.343 --> 00:36:13.439
not clinically depressed.  
You're clinically depressed.

00:36:13.440 --> 00:36:15.677
(Laughter.)
   » JONATHAN FRANZEN:  So it 

00:36:15.678 --> 00:36:19.530
was hill air just, but those 
were real fights.  I had been in

00:36:19.531 --> 00:36:21.775
one myself.
   (Laughter.)

00:36:23.616 --> 00:36:25.616
» JONATHAN FRANZEN:  It was like
... and yeah.

00:36:28.898 --> 00:36:30.750
So it is like okay, well I've 
kind of got a handle on this 

00:36:30.751 --> 00:36:32.979
guy.  And yes, it does draw in 
what is 

00:36:36.650 --> 00:36:39.508
happening in the world because 
why not?  It's fun.

00:36:40.736 --> 00:36:42.736
» MARIE ARANA:  Right, right.
   » JONATHAN FRANZEN:  I'm an 

00:36:45.213 --> 00:36:46.436
entertainer, looking for what's 
fun.

00:36:46.437 --> 00:36:48.437
» MARIE ARANA:  Let me ask you 
now, talking about real life.

00:36:52.366 --> 00:36:54.418
Because one of the things that I
think would be really 

00:36:54.419 --> 00:36:57.084
interesting to explore, 
particularly with your work, is 

00:36:57.085 --> 00:36:59.085
the way 

00:37:02.164 --> 00:37:04.164
that fiction in some ways gets 
across a 

00:37:05.626 --> 00:37:07.660
reality better than sometimes 
nonfiction can.

00:37:11.157 --> 00:37:13.595
What does fiction in your mind, 
how does it do that for a 

00:37:13.596 --> 00:37:18.476
society?  How does it feed us?  
How does it nurture us in that 

00:37:18.477 --> 00:37:19.895
sense?
   » JONATHAN FRANZEN:  I 

00:37:19.896 --> 00:37:21.896
actually think 

00:37:22.991 --> 00:37:25.044
the people who read Denis 
Johnson level fiction are the 

00:37:25.045 --> 00:37:27.892
lucky ones.  And I don't mean 
economically the lucky  ones.

00:37:31.350 --> 00:37:33.794
I mean just lucky that something
is going right if you can 

00:37:33.795 --> 00:37:36.461
sustain attention in a novel.  
If you are really miserable you 

00:37:36.462 --> 00:37:38.462
can't do that.

00:37:41.389 --> 00:37:44.027
In the prison population there 
are the readers and those are 

00:37:44.028 --> 00:37:46.028
the lucky ones.

00:37:47.104 --> 00:37:49.104
In any population, it is 
actually -- 

00:37:51.566 --> 00:37:53.652
so if you can enjoy a book, you 
should pause for a moment of 

00:37:53.653 --> 00:37:56.086
gratitude that you are able to 
do that.  A lot of people can't.

00:38:00.173 --> 00:38:02.638
If you can enjoy a complicated 
dark book that laughs at things 

00:38:02.639 --> 00:38:06.503
that other people might find 
terrible, you are  really, 

00:38:06.504 --> 00:38:09.351
really lucky.  That is almost a 
definition of what we 

00:38:13.612 --> 00:38:16.660
call literature, is that kind of
cosmic distance on stuff.  If 

00:38:16.661 --> 00:38:18.725
you are down in the trenches you
can't do that.

00:38:23.404 --> 00:38:25.404
Yeah, so I think I talk a lot 
about 

00:38:29.741 --> 00:38:32.596
the metamorphose sis, France 
Kafka's novel about waking up to

00:38:32.597 --> 00:38:34.597
find you're an insect.

00:38:37.307 --> 00:38:39.604
I could have done a midstream 
memoir talking about how crappy 

00:38:39.605 --> 00:38:41.840
it was to live at home with his 
parents and not even 

00:38:45.082 --> 00:38:47.927
have a good bedroom even though 
he's the son.  And this is a 

00:38:47.928 --> 00:38:50.771
grown man, working a job for 
years.  There he is at home with

00:38:50.772 --> 00:38:52.772
the parents.

00:38:55.655 --> 00:38:58.115
And he could have probably 
gotten across some of why he 

00:38:58.116 --> 00:39:00.116
found that a drag.
   » MARIE ARANA:  Right.

00:39:01.357 --> 00:39:03.397
» JONATHAN FRANZEN:  But to get 
at really the degree to which he

00:39:07.889 --> 00:39:11.933
experienced that as unbelievably
terrible, he made you a story.  

00:39:11.934 --> 00:39:13.934
He invented something.

00:39:15.601 --> 00:39:17.827
And also in the process good 
thing for fiction, he protected 

00:39:17.828 --> 00:39:20.677
his family.
   (Laughter.)

00:39:21.085 --> 00:39:23.085
» JONATHAN FRANZEN:  Everyone 
knew 

00:39:24.752 --> 00:39:29.513
that the Kafkas did not have a 
large bug for a son.  And the 

00:39:29.514 --> 00:39:32.165
parents were oh, it's not us!
   (Laughter.)

00:39:32.976 --> 00:39:34.002
» JONATHAN FRANZEN:  How could 
that be us?

00:39:34.003 --> 00:39:38.690
(Laughter.)
   » JONATHAN FRANZEN:  Franz is

00:39:38.691 --> 00:39:41.154
a little weird but he is not an 
insect.

00:39:43.390 --> 00:39:45.422
I think that broadly speaking 
that's a metaphor for what 

00:39:45.423 --> 00:39:47.423
fiction does.

00:39:51.128 --> 00:39:53.128
It enables you to go exaggerate 
in 

00:39:57.284 --> 00:39:59.284
these wild ways that mirror 

00:40:00.327 --> 00:40:02.327
representation of reality can't,
states 

00:40:04.839 --> 00:40:06.839
of mind, emotional states and 
lots of 

00:40:09.758 --> 00:40:12.185
other kinds of states that mere 
factual representation simply 

00:40:12.186 --> 00:40:13.214
cannot.
   » MARIE ARANA:  Of course, 

00:40:13.215 --> 00:40:15.215
that 

00:40:19.122 --> 00:40:21.558
brings me, you are talking about
the way that fiction works, that

00:40:21.559 --> 00:40:23.559
humor in 

00:40:26.460 --> 00:40:28.460
fiction and which Denis used so 
superbly 

00:40:29.901 --> 00:40:31.901
in the middle of the darkest 
sort of funkiest moments.

00:40:35.209 --> 00:40:36.214
You would find it screamingly 
funny.

00:40:36.215 --> 00:40:38.702
» JONATHAN FRANZEN:  His word 
choice in a fatal accident, the 

00:40:38.703 --> 00:40:40.703
first story?

00:40:43.597 --> 00:40:46.261
Jesus' son, I think when the car
crash happens the woman says:  

00:40:46.262 --> 00:40:48.706
No.  The woman said viciously.

00:40:52.589 --> 00:40:54.589
That word viciously, which is 
like 

00:40:55.631 --> 00:40:57.631
ahead-on crash is about to 
occur.

00:41:02.798 --> 00:41:06.086
Yeah, that tells me he resolved 
something.  And could see it 

00:41:06.087 --> 00:41:08.087
from the kind of 

00:41:09.994 --> 00:41:12.834
perspective in which things on 
the one hand he's sort of 

00:41:12.835 --> 00:41:14.835
touching close to God.

00:41:15.943 --> 00:41:18.197
On the other hand he's touching 
-- it's all hilarious.

00:41:21.675 --> 00:41:24.326
If you get the nuke story 
collection if for no other 

00:41:24.327 --> 00:41:26.565
reason there's a two and a half 
page scene of the numerator 

00:41:30.442 --> 00:41:32.677
having a knee examination in 
surgical theater while tripping 

00:41:32.678 --> 00:41:34.678
on  LSD.

00:41:35.724 --> 00:41:37.148
If there's any doubt he was a 
comic writer ...

00:41:37.149 --> 00:41:39.149
» MARIE ARANA:  Right.

00:41:40.804 --> 00:41:42.839
In fact, you made a wonderful 
citation at his prize ceremony.

00:41:46.293 --> 00:41:48.293
And I want to read at least part
of 

00:41:49.591 --> 00:41:51.413
it:  You said his sentences at 
best are miracles of 

00:41:51.414 --> 00:41:54.085
transparency and tone which 
you've already heard, perfect in

00:41:54.086 --> 00:41:56.119
the way they inhabit the page 
but devoid of 

00:41:59.582 --> 00:42:02.438
vanity, always vivid in their 
reference to the actual but 

00:42:02.439 --> 00:42:04.439
always conveying something 
larger.

00:42:06.540 --> 00:42:09.193
The creator's own self knowledge
and compassion and sense of 

00:42:09.194 --> 00:42:11.835
cosmic  comedy.  The God I want 
to believe in has a 

00:42:15.096 --> 00:42:15.302
voice like Johnson's.
   » JONATHAN FRANZEN:  Right.

00:42:15.303 --> 00:42:17.745
   (Laughter.)

00:42:20.999 --> 00:42:23.647
» JONATHAN FRANZEN:  Oh, I don't
know.  Stress on want to, as in 

00:42:23.648 --> 00:42:26.508
wish I could.  But yeah, if 
there were a God who 

00:42:30.385 --> 00:42:32.385
spoke with that kind of ...

00:42:33.853 --> 00:42:34.054
I'm not going to try to 
explicate that.

00:42:34.055 --> 00:42:36.733
» MARIE ARANA:  Okay.  I think 
what it meant --

00:42:38.378 --> 00:42:40.378
» JONATHAN FRANZEN:  Thank you!
   (Laughter.

00:42:41.578 --> 00:42:43.578
)

00:42:45.112 --> 00:42:47.351
» MARIE ARANA:  IfIf I may?
   » JONATHAN FRANZEN:  You 

00:42:47.352 --> 00:42:49.794
absolutely may.
   » MARIE ARANA:  That he 

00:42:49.795 --> 00:42:51.795
really had a 

00:42:53.671 --> 00:42:55.671
voice, I mean a very strong 
voice.

00:42:59.052 --> 00:43:01.052
If we could pinpoint that 
talent, it 

00:43:02.751 --> 00:43:05.621
would be that voice that he had 
that was absolutely unique and 

00:43:05.622 --> 00:43:08.660
original, as yours is, I would 
say.

00:43:10.285 --> 00:43:12.285
   » JONATHAN FRANZEN:  Thank 
you.

00:43:17.210 --> 00:43:19.210
» MARIE ARANA:  That sense that 
you 

00:43:21.348 --> 00:43:23.348
are in the hands of a really 
superb 

00:43:25.430 --> 00:43:28.892
numerator and narrator and you 
can't quite let go.  It's 

00:43:28.893 --> 00:43:30.306
mesmerizing, that voice.
   » JONATHAN FRANZEN:  Thank 

00:43:30.307 --> 00:43:30.719
you.
   » MARIE ARANA:  Is that what 

00:43:30.720 --> 00:43:32.551
you meant?
   » JONATHAN FRANZEN:  No, I 

00:43:32.552 --> 00:43:35.206
was not talking about myself; I 
was talking about Denis.

00:43:39.064 --> 00:43:41.714
But ... yeah.

00:43:45.201 --> 00:43:47.201
I thought actually Marilyn put 
it nicely.

00:43:48.512 --> 00:43:50.512
There is a sense of a kind of 
unitary, 

00:43:51.571 --> 00:43:53.825
what he -- the writing and the 
person were almost 

00:43:53.826 --> 00:43:55.826
indistinguishable.

00:43:58.507 --> 00:44:00.507
It strikes me, and I think our 
other 

00:44:01.769 --> 00:44:05.853
two guests who will soon join me
can speak to this.  He is 

00:44:05.854 --> 00:44:07.854
somebody who might very well not
have survived.

00:44:10.965 --> 00:44:12.965
He was a kind of messed up kid.

00:44:14.664 --> 00:44:17.525
And had intimate knowledge with 
these, you know, pretty violent 

00:44:17.526 --> 00:44:19.977
and definitely addictive 
situations.

00:44:26.117 --> 00:44:28.117
And there is a sense of at the 
core, I 

00:44:30.176 --> 00:44:32.011
think, of all of his -- I was 
rereading the nuke stories on 

00:44:32.012 --> 00:44:34.012
the way down here.

00:44:36.111 --> 00:44:37.535
The whole book kind of feels 
like a meditation -- not a 

00:44:37.536 --> 00:44:40.192
meditation.  It is a 
representation of the 

00:44:42.467 --> 00:44:44.467
amazingness of still being 
alive.

00:44:46.351 --> 00:44:48.351
So that there is something about

00:44:51.047 --> 00:44:53.047
everything he wrote that is 
aware of the proximity of death.

00:44:56.343 --> 00:44:58.343
That goes to, in that respect I 
think 

00:45:00.207 --> 00:45:02.207
there's a subterranean 
connection with 

00:45:05.074 --> 00:45:07.074
flan ry O'Connor, in her 
greatest of all 

00:45:09.388 --> 00:45:11.388
her great stories, a good man is
hard to 

00:45:13.253 --> 00:45:14.900
find, it would have been a good 
man if somebody had been there 

00:45:14.901 --> 00:45:18.004
to shoot her every day of her 
life, about the grandmother in 

00:45:18.005 --> 00:45:21.076
that story.  If you don't know 
the story, go read it.

00:45:23.929 --> 00:45:25.929
Which is basically -- this was a

00:45:27.805 --> 00:45:29.647
trivial woman who with a gun 
pointed at her suddenly found 

00:45:29.648 --> 00:45:31.648
something.

00:45:33.112 --> 00:45:34.949
And somehow throughout his 
career he managed to write the 

00:45:34.950 --> 00:45:38.406
stuff that felt right on that 
bubble of there's a gun pointed 

00:45:38.407 --> 00:45:43.922
at me.  Death is all around me. 
I've seen people die.  I'm aware

00:45:43.923 --> 00:45:45.923
that I'm going to die.

00:45:47.586 --> 00:45:49.586
And there is a line in the new 
book, 

00:45:50.653 --> 00:45:53.089
you know, I like my wife.  She 
is, you know, clever and rather 

00:45:53.505 --> 00:45:55.505
attractive.

00:45:56.559 --> 00:46:00.428
She could die any minute.  And 
then he just says that.  New 

00:46:00.429 --> 00:46:03.739
paragraph, we're on to the rest 
of the story.  But that seemed 

00:46:03.740 --> 00:46:07.005
to me kind of the essence of the
work.  That's why what makes it 

00:46:07.006 --> 00:46:09.006
so exciting 

00:46:10.466 --> 00:46:12.466
is that  there's always death 
right there.

00:46:12.891 --> 00:46:15.357
» MARIE ARANA:  Right there, 
yes.  Well, with death right 

00:46:15.358 --> 00:46:17.775
there, let's bring on Elliot 
Ackerman.

00:46:17.776 --> 00:46:19.776
(Applause.

00:46:20.810 --> 00:46:22.810
)

00:46:29.849 --> 00:46:32.698
   » MARIE ARANA:  Here is a 
quote.  He.

00:46:33.513 --> 00:46:34.740
» ELLIOT ACKERMAN:  That might 
be my favorite introduction.

00:46:34.741 --> 00:46:36.978
(Laughter.)
   » MARIE ARANA:  Here is a 

00:46:36.979 --> 00:46:38.979
quote to 

00:46:40.068 --> 00:46:42.068
accompany  you, to have you 
accompany us as I did for John.

00:46:45.423 --> 00:46:47.423
This is from Ben fountain, who 
wrote a 

00:46:49.522 --> 00:46:51.151
wonderful book called Billy 
Lynn's long half time walk, if 

00:46:51.152 --> 00:46:56.439
you know it.  He wrote about 
Elliot:  "Dark at the Crossing" 

00:46:56.440 --> 00:46:59.085
is every bit as taught and har 
owing as the place it depicts, a

00:46:59.086 --> 00:47:01.086
region 

00:47:03.003 --> 00:47:05.003
where 15 years of relentless war
play 

00:47:06.682 --> 00:47:08.682
out in refugee camps and  
shopping mall.

00:47:09.930 --> 00:47:12.621
He has written a mercyless novel
of broken lives, broken places 

00:47:12.622 --> 00:47:15.254
and good intentions gone awry.

00:47:18.347 --> 00:47:20.347
Someone once said of you if I 

00:47:23.250 --> 00:47:25.735
remember correctly that they 
don't award medals of valor for 

00:47:25.736 --> 00:47:27.736
writing, but maybe 

00:47:28.998 --> 00:47:30.998
they should to you.

00:47:34.293 --> 00:47:36.765
There is a sense, Elliot, in 
your books, both of them, that 

00:47:36.766 --> 00:47:38.766
you've merged 

00:47:40.897 --> 00:47:42.897
from the Calderon of hell to 
tell this  story.

00:47:45.771 --> 00:47:48.019
This is going to make Jon's 
blood pressure rise because I 

00:47:48.020 --> 00:47:51.287
read somewhere that he hates 
this question, but I'm going to 

00:47:51.288 --> 00:47:56.391
ask this question.  How auto 
biographical are these stories? 

00:47:56.392 --> 00:47:59.035
In the sense that you have lived
through any -- of course you 

00:47:59.036 --> 00:48:01.036
lived 

00:48:03.944 --> 00:48:05.944
through the hell of war, but to 
what extent are these from life?

00:48:05.995 --> 00:48:07.995
   » ELLIOT ACKERMAN:  Well, you
know, 

00:48:10.326 --> 00:48:11.766
my first book is the story of an
Afghan who is murdered by an 

00:48:11.767 --> 00:48:13.767
American.

00:48:14.818 --> 00:48:16.234
All pulled from the perspective 
of the Afghan.  So that's not 

00:48:16.235 --> 00:48:18.235
me.

00:48:20.096 --> 00:48:22.096
And my second novel takes place 
in 

00:48:23.658 --> 00:48:25.280
southern Turkey around the sir 
Indian Civil War and those 

00:48:25.281 --> 00:48:27.930
characters are not me.  However,
they are deeply informed by my 

00:48:27.931 --> 00:48:31.400
experience.  I don't think I 
could extricate my experiences 

00:48:31.401 --> 00:48:33.401
from the book.
   » MARIE ARANA:  Right.

00:48:36.557 --> 00:48:38.557
But there is a sense, especially
in 

00:48:44.316 --> 00:48:46.316
"Green on Blue", that you are 
not sure what side is which.

00:48:49.630 --> 00:48:52.531
It remind he me of revolutions 
in which the sides keep changing

00:48:52.532 --> 00:48:54.532
all the 

00:48:56.004 --> 00:48:58.246
time because people see the 
battles going this way, the 

00:48:58.247 --> 00:49:01.113
battles going that way and they 
are going to run to whatever 

00:49:01.114 --> 00:49:03.114
side is winning.

00:49:06.823 --> 00:49:09.117
There is that sense of divided 
or confused  loyalties and the 

00:49:09.118 --> 00:49:12.394
fog of it all, in a sense.  That
is clearly something that you've

00:49:13.205 --> 00:49:15.665
seen.
   » ELLIOT ACKERMAN:  Well, 

00:49:15.666 --> 00:49:19.332
it's something that I have seen 
and something I admire in other 

00:49:19.333 --> 00:49:22.009
people's writing and something I
admired in Denis Johnson' 

00:49:24.862 --> 00:49:27.509
writing, the ability to take 
extremely complex political 

00:49:27.510 --> 00:49:30.381
events and make them feel 
extremely personal.  It is 

00:49:30.382 --> 00:49:32.382
something that fiction does.

00:49:34.721 --> 00:49:37.610
But then you get, talking about 
like different sides of an issue

00:49:37.611 --> 00:49:42.315
in a war.  For instance, there's
the -- what is the trope someone

00:49:42.316 --> 00:49:44.717
just said the other day?  Maybe 
it was on television, you don't 

00:49:46.805 --> 00:49:48.232
really know a person until you 
have been divorced from them.

00:49:48.233 --> 00:49:50.306
   (Chuckles.)
   » ELLIOT ACKERMAN:  That is 

00:49:50.307 --> 00:49:54.591
probably true.  I would appear 
pend to that, you don't really 

00:49:54.592 --> 00:49:57.037
know a person until you've 
fought on the opposite side of a

00:49:57.038 --> 00:49:59.038
war from them.

00:50:00.083 --> 00:50:02.541
And so I think there is sort  of
-- sometimes we'll see, why are 

00:50:02.542 --> 00:50:06.391
you so fascinated by the people 
on the other sides f these 

00:50:06.392 --> 00:50:08.392
conflicts?

00:50:10.460 --> 00:50:12.460
In some ways they are the people
you 

00:50:14.534 --> 00:50:16.534
know the best until, trot out 
another 

00:50:21.506 --> 00:50:23.339
» MARIE ARANA:  Particularly in 
Iraq and Afghanistan you are 

00:50:23.340 --> 00:50:26.234
fighting alongside people who 
are of that land 

00:50:32.774 --> 00:50:34.774
and with whom you have to make 
bonds.

00:50:37.462 --> 00:50:39.462
I mean, one thing I think that 
you 

00:50:40.929 --> 00:50:42.149
said so eloquently is that a 
marine is trained to kill, 

00:50:42.150 --> 00:50:44.150
right?

00:50:45.211 --> 00:50:47.211
But he also has to be trained to
love.  And why?

00:50:49.688 --> 00:50:51.688
Because he has to throw himself 
in the 

00:50:54.615 --> 00:50:56.615
line of fire for his buddy, for 
his 

00:50:57.660 --> 00:50:59.900
compatriot, for the person he is
fighting with.

00:51:06.856 --> 00:51:08.856
That really interests me, that 
notion 

00:51:11.560 --> 00:51:13.560
of you are essentially falling 
in love 

00:51:15.798 --> 00:51:17.798
with or loving a person

00:51:20.205 --> 00:51:22.205
whose life is at risk and who 
may day or will die.

00:51:22.648 --> 00:51:24.681
» ELLIOT ACKERMAN:  I think it 
gets to sort of the topic of our

00:51:24.682 --> 00:51:30.013
panel here and what is very 
unique in Johnson's work is that

00:51:30.014 --> 00:51:32.014
he is so often at the edge.

00:51:33.706 --> 00:51:35.955
I would say it's also almost 
like an  extremely thin membrane

00:51:35.956 --> 00:51:37.956
that is translucent when you are
standing right 

00:51:40.847 --> 00:51:45.171
up against issues, particularly 
issues of conflict and war.  We 

00:51:45.172 --> 00:51:47.172
are fascinated by that subject. 
The difference between love and 

00:51:50.468 --> 00:51:52.468
violence is so permeable.

00:51:53.734 --> 00:51:55.761
So I mean, I found in my own 
experience, I have found in my 

00:51:55.762 --> 00:51:57.762
own 

00:52:00.313 --> 00:52:02.742
experience in war, some of the 
great ironies, people are doing 

00:52:02.743 --> 00:52:07.630
courageous things because they 
love each other but the 

00:52:07.631 --> 00:52:11.729
courageous things they are doing
are incredibly violent.  You are

00:52:11.730 --> 00:52:13.730
constantly flipping or 
permeating that membrane.

00:52:15.199 --> 00:52:17.199
» MARIE ARANA:  Speaking of 

00:52:20.891 --> 00:52:22.891
membranes, the "Dark at the 
Crossing", 

00:52:25.181 --> 00:52:27.181
deals with an Iraqi who is born 
in Iraq but an American citizen.

00:52:29.319 --> 00:52:31.319
And we can't help but wonder as 
we 

00:52:32.385 --> 00:52:34.385
read it and he wonders it 
himself where his loyalties lie.

00:52:37.491 --> 00:52:39.499
And what it means to be true to 
one's self when you have two 

00:52:39.500 --> 00:52:41.500
identities at 

00:52:44.013 --> 00:52:46.013
work, two nationalities at work,
two loyalties.

00:52:48.515 --> 00:52:50.515
And how did you get to that 
subject?

00:52:51.799 --> 00:52:52.610
How did that come to you?
   » ELLIOT ACKERMAN:  This 

00:52:52.611 --> 00:52:55.485
character who is an Arab 
American, basically 

00:53:00.008 --> 00:53:02.465
decides he wants to go cross 
into Syria to fight for the free

00:53:02.466 --> 00:53:05.723
Syrian Army.  A lot of the book 
is about unpacking his  

00:53:05.724 --> 00:53:07.724
motivations.

00:53:09.192 --> 00:53:12.055
It gets to what Jon was just 
saying with the flan ry O'Connor

00:53:12.056 --> 00:53:14.056
story about 

00:53:18.038 --> 00:53:20.038
the gun and in Stanley cube 
Rick's book.

00:53:21.111 --> 00:53:23.111
They say animal mother is a 
great guy.

00:53:24.975 --> 00:53:27.439
You just need someone to throw 
hand grenades at him the rest of

00:53:27.440 --> 00:53:29.440
his life.

00:53:30.764 --> 00:53:32.764
He is in the same position, but 
to be 

00:53:34.255 --> 00:53:36.081
honest with you, the thing that 
was for most in my mind wasn't 

00:53:36.082 --> 00:53:38.082
anything that happened in the 
war.

00:53:42.596 --> 00:53:44.596
It was a scene in Anna Karenina 
and the way it ends.

00:53:48.120 --> 00:53:50.120
Spoiler alert, she throws 
herself in 

00:53:51.591 --> 00:53:54.057
front of a train and commits 
suicide.

00:53:51.591 --> 00:53:55.442
(Laughter.)
   » ELLIOT ACKERMAN:  Her lover

00:53:55.443 --> 00:53:57.443
gets a bad wrap.

00:54:01.152 --> 00:54:03.152
The world hear tough on 
Veronsky.

00:54:04.415 --> 00:54:06.862
He's disgraced, and the last we 
see of him, you don't see him 

00:54:06.863 --> 00:54:08.863
but you are told 

00:54:10.311 --> 00:54:12.311
by another character that he was
last 

00:54:14.614 --> 00:54:16.614
seen on a train headed to the 
caucuses 

00:54:20.085 --> 00:54:26.686
to rejoin his regiment.
   He could be rejoining his 

00:54:26.687 --> 00:54:31.999
regiment because he thinks it's 
a battlefield, the way he can 

00:54:32.000 --> 00:54:34.037
redeem himself and integrate 
again into society.  Okay.

00:54:37.320 --> 00:54:39.320
Or he could be going there, he 
could 

00:54:40.805 --> 00:54:42.805
be on that train for the same 
reasons as 

00:54:44.081 --> 00:54:46.081
how Anna ended herself, going to
war to kill herself.

00:54:49.571 --> 00:54:51.571
You never get the whole story 
from Tolstoy.

00:54:53.063 --> 00:54:55.923
I was  fascinated, people can 
engage in one act, go to war for

00:54:55.924 --> 00:54:57.924
reasons they don't even know 
themselves.

00:55:00.591 --> 00:55:02.866
It could be a redemptive or 
destructiontive act.   That's 

00:55:02.867 --> 00:55:04.867
something I was hoping to 
examine.

00:55:07.316 --> 00:55:09.316
» MARIE ARANA:  Well, you as 
Denis 

00:55:11.615 --> 00:55:13.615
did in "Tree of Smoke", that 
sense of 

00:55:17.955 --> 00:55:19.955
the complete sort of suspension 
in a 

00:55:21.009 --> 00:55:23.450
kind of wild card situation.
   » ELLIOT ACKERMAN:  Like in

angels, one of my favorite books
of his, you

have this sort of -- it is not 
banal, but every day.  Opens on 

00:55:31.820 --> 00:55:36.505
a bus.  There's a guy meeting a 
woman on the bus, she has a kid.

00:55:40.442 --> 00:55:43.105
You end up in the middle of a 
bank robbery.  The way he could 

00:55:43.106 --> 00:55:46.984
slip you from the banal into the
very, very violent and put you 

00:55:46.985 --> 00:55:48.985
in situations where you can't 
imagine that you're in.

00:55:52.289 --> 00:55:54.289
I think that was the wonderful 
thing 

00:55:57.613 --> 00:55:59.613
he did in his work and I aspire 
to do in my work.

00:56:03.380 --> 00:56:05.380
Violence is so banal.
   » MARIE ARANA:  Dealing with 

00:56:07.274 --> 00:56:09.274
violence, it seems to me it is 
so 

00:56:10.355 --> 00:56:12.355
physical, it's so concrete and 
it is all around you.

00:56:14.032 --> 00:56:16.032
And yet you deal with these war 
situations.

00:56:16.671 --> 00:56:18.671
But you also said at one point, 

00:56:21.009 --> 00:56:23.903
Elliot, you quote actually 
Faulkner in which you say the --

00:56:23.904 --> 00:56:28.413
he said the only thing worth 
writing about is the human heart

00:56:28.414 --> 00:56:31.076
in conflict with itself.  That 
being the conflict, not being 

00:56:31.077 --> 00:56:33.077
the 

00:56:34.146 --> 00:56:36.376
conflict that is around you 
concretely and possibly 

00:56:36.377 --> 00:56:41.131
threatening your life.  It seems
what interests you more is the 

00:56:41.132 --> 00:56:42.954
internal conflict that is going 
on even as that conflict is 

00:56:42.955 --> 00:56:46.462
happening.   » ELLIOT ACKERMAN: 
I think it's a thing that 

00:56:46.463 --> 00:56:50.773
interests most people.  I mean, 
characters are interesting.  You

00:56:50.774 --> 00:56:52.774
know, once you start getting  
into 

00:56:54.038 --> 00:56:57.699
-- you were talking before about
what does fiction do?  It takes 

00:56:57.700 --> 00:57:00.542
you into the internal lives of 
these people.  That's where the 

00:57:00.543 --> 00:57:04.026
compelling sphoars arise and 
where the emotion exists.  Why 

00:57:04.027 --> 00:57:08.321
write fiction?  I think if you 
are able to make someone feel 

00:57:08.322 --> 00:57:10.763
something, they will remember 
what they felt in a way they 

00:57:12.381 --> 00:57:13.621
might not remember what they 
read in the paper that morning.

00:57:13.622 --> 00:57:15.622
   » MARIE ARANA:  Uh-huh.

00:57:18.308 --> 00:57:21.395
One last question for you and 
that is:  You're a warrior.

00:57:22.831 --> 00:57:23.025
» ELLIOT ACKERMAN:  On my good 
days.

00:57:23.026 --> 00:57:27.739
(Laughter.)
   » MARIE ARANA:  And you know,

00:57:30.164 --> 00:57:32.164
warriors come home and things 
happen.

00:57:36.070 --> 00:57:38.070
And do we -- I'm trying to take 
this 

00:57:41.121 --> 00:57:43.121
out to

00:57:46.921 --> 00:57:48.980
a more social or political 
question, if you will.

00:57:53.729 --> 00:57:55.729
Why do we revere warriors?

00:57:56.793 --> 00:57:59.470
We revere warriors from afar.  
When they come home riddled with

00:58:01.900 --> 00:58:03.900
problems, when they may be 
addicted to 

00:58:06.999 --> 00:58:09.240
drugs or beating their wives or 
as a female beating her husband 

00:58:09.241 --> 00:58:14.972
or not being good to the 
children, why is it that we are 

00:58:14.973 --> 00:58:18.845
not so good at confronting those
issues that they bring home?

00:58:20.478 --> 00:58:22.920
» ELLIOT ACKERMAN:  Well, I 
think in some respects it's easy

00:58:22.921 --> 00:58:27.020
at that point to look at them as
the other.  You know, I've often

00:58:27.021 --> 00:58:30.877
I think probably most people who
have my background have had the 

00:58:30.878 --> 00:58:33.130
experience of someone saying to 
them:  I could never imagine 

00:58:33.131 --> 00:58:36.388
what you went through.  I'm like
yeah, you can.  I'm sure you 

00:58:36.389 --> 00:58:38.389
can.

00:58:39.490 --> 00:58:41.490
You can maybe pass by a car 
accident 

00:58:42.592 --> 00:58:44.009
or you lost someone in your own 
family.

00:58:44.010 --> 00:58:46.458
At the same time saying I can 
never imagine what you went 

00:58:46.459 --> 00:58:48.459
through, it always 

00:58:49.942 --> 00:58:52.614
is unsettling to me not only 
because it shows -- because it 

00:58:52.615 --> 00:58:56.704
puts up some like lack of 
empathy.  It's like if you can 

00:58:56.705 --> 00:58:58.760
never imagine what I went 
through or someone went  

00:59:00.380 --> 00:59:02.380
through, what you are basically 
saying 

00:59:04.263 --> 00:59:06.923
is I have been so inalterablely 
changed by an experience or one 

00:59:06.924 --> 00:59:10.844
has been, that you can no longer
identify with them.  So if you 

00:59:10.845 --> 00:59:12.845
can't understand what I went 

00:59:14.720 --> 00:59:16.146
through, that means I am so 
unalterablely changed, I can 

00:59:16.147 --> 00:59:18.390
never go back to being the 
person I was before I left.

00:59:22.081 --> 00:59:23.299
If I can't, in effect I can 
never come home.

00:59:23.300 --> 00:59:25.978
» MARIE ARANA:  Right.
   » ELLIOT ACKERMAN:  That is 

00:59:25.979 --> 00:59:28.007
somewhere we just can't be.

00:59:32.102 --> 00:59:34.102
So I think that maybe to answer 
your 

00:59:35.574 --> 00:59:37.406
question, just a general lack of
empathy, lack of being able to 

00:59:37.407 --> 00:59:40.659
see ourselves collectively in 
these wars.

00:59:41.486 --> 00:59:43.486
» MARIE ARANA:  Right, right.

00:59:45.163 --> 00:59:47.163
With that I want to bring on Sam

00:59:51.763 --> 00:59:52.159
Quinones, who deals with issues 
of ...

00:59:52.160 --> 00:59:54.160
(Applause.

00:59:55.166 --> 00:59:58.503
)
   » MARIE ARANA:  -- and here 

00:59:58.504 --> 01:00:00.504
is what I want to read about 
Sam.

01:00:02.976 --> 01:00:04.976
This is written by Laura Miller 
at slate.

01:00:07.493 --> 01:00:09.733
Many nonfiction are padded 
features, but dream land, the 

01:00:09.734 --> 01:00:11.734
three pronged story 

01:00:13.627 --> 01:00:15.627
of how heroin addiction became 
epidemic 

01:00:17.107 --> 01:00:19.393
in small town mart, Sam had to 
quit his job at the L.A. times 

01:00:19.394 --> 01:00:21.394
to write.

01:00:22.865 --> 01:00:24.865
You, from the hollowing out of 
the 

01:00:26.971 --> 01:00:28.807
middle class to the greedy 
marketing of pharmaceutical of 

01:00:28.808 --> 01:00:30.808
opiates to the 

01:00:32.102 --> 01:00:34.102
residents of the obscure Mexican
state 

01:00:40.526 --> 01:00:42.526
of  Nairete these create a oitd 
add 

01:00:45.044 --> 01:00:47.044
ficted, residents priced out of 
pill 

01:00:49.334 --> 01:00:51.334
mills turn to a newly cheap 
choice.

01:00:54.018 --> 01:00:56.301
This illuminates a catastrophe 
unfolding around us right now.

01:00:56.302 --> 01:00:58.992
   Sam, you covered the border, 
the U.S.

01:01:02.246 --> 01:01:04.246
Mexico relations, you have been 
a Latin 

01:01:05.910 --> 01:01:07.910
American correspond dent for 
many years.

01:01:11.578 --> 01:01:14.109
At what point did the opioid 
epidemic grab your attention?

01:01:15.127 --> 01:01:17.770
   » SAM QUINONES:  I grabbed 
the story when I was at the L.A.

01:01:20.021 --> 01:01:22.286
times about a small town in 
Mexico where everybody comes to 

01:01:22.287 --> 01:01:24.287
the United 

01:01:25.369 --> 01:01:27.848
States to sell heroin like 
pizza.  So there's a delivery 

01:01:27.849 --> 01:01:29.849
system where you 

01:01:30.896 --> 01:01:33.162
call a number and then the 
operator takes your order and 

01:01:33.163 --> 01:01:35.163
then dispatches someone to meet 
you.

01:01:38.686 --> 01:01:40.686
It's basically domino's pizza of
heroin.

01:01:44.421 --> 01:01:46.421
And I came upon it when I was 
talking 

01:01:47.667 --> 01:01:49.716
to a guy with the DEA in 
Columbus.  He said we have this 

01:01:49.717 --> 01:01:52.576
system here, these guys doing 
this.  We have never seen this 

01:01:52.577 --> 01:01:54.820
before.  No guns.  They don't 
use guns.

01:01:58.688 --> 01:02:00.274
They are -- we can arrest them, 
arrest them, they send more 

01:02:00.275 --> 01:02:02.275
people.

01:02:03.335 --> 01:02:05.335
They reconstitute some kind of 
mute ant very quickly.

01:02:08.448 --> 01:02:10.448
And he said they are all from 
the same town.

01:02:13.345 --> 01:02:15.802
And that, I lived in Mexico for 
ten years and I had written a 

01:02:15.803 --> 01:02:17.803
lot about -- 

01:02:18.860 --> 01:02:20.860
you see this a lot across Mexico
where 

01:02:22.958 --> 01:02:24.958
towns, towns where people do one
job.

01:02:26.023 --> 01:02:28.680
And there is one town in my 
first book where everybody in 

01:02:28.681 --> 01:02:30.681
the town makes popsicles.

01:02:32.749 --> 01:02:34.789
One of the great businesses for 
arriving at the middle class in 

01:02:34.790 --> 01:02:37.027
Mexico is the popsicle business.

01:02:40.096 --> 01:02:45.190
There's a business in Mexico,.
   (Phrase.) and that's one town

01:02:45.191 --> 01:02:47.191
that started that.

01:02:48.680 --> 01:02:50.680
You go to the town and in the 
front of 

01:02:51.726 --> 01:02:53.726
the town there's a two-story 
concrete 

01:02:55.220 --> 01:02:57.259
popsicle statue saying thank you
to the popsicle for bringing 

01:02:57.260 --> 01:02:59.685
them to the middle class.
   When he told me that, I knew 

01:02:59.686 --> 01:03:01.686
he was right.  He didn't know 
which town.

01:03:05.003 --> 01:03:07.003
He said it was Tepique.  I knew 
that was not.

01:03:10.491 --> 01:03:13.958
It's a capitol city, 300,000 
people.  It couldn't be true.  

01:03:13.959 --> 01:03:16.409
It had to be a small town.  I 
wrote to guys he arrested in 

01:03:16.410 --> 01:03:18.410
federal prison.

01:03:19.664 --> 01:03:21.927
One after another, I wrote 20, 
30 letters to these letters, 

01:03:21.928 --> 01:03:26.206
hey, you want to talk about your
pizza heroin system basically, 

01:03:26.207 --> 01:03:28.207
is what it is.
   (Chuckles.)

01:03:28.668 --> 01:03:31.767
» SAM QUINONES:  One guy got 
back to me.  Yeah, we're not 

01:03:31.768 --> 01:03:33.768
from Tapique.

01:03:35.427 --> 01:03:40.740
We're all from Jalisco.  We are 
all heroin traffickers.  I 

01:03:40.741 --> 01:03:42.767
thought at the time it was 
Columbus because that's where I 

01:03:42.768 --> 01:03:44.768
first encountered this.

01:03:46.648 --> 01:03:47.869
And then he began to say oh, no,
no, no we're all over the 

01:03:47.870 --> 01:03:51.126
country.  I could not explain a 
few things about that.

01:03:53.972 --> 01:03:56.212
First of all, they sold black 
tar heroin.  My understanding, 

01:03:56.213 --> 01:03:58.861
knowledge of black tar heroin 
was fairly extensive at that 

01:03:58.862 --> 01:04:03.153
point.  It is really for many 
years only on the western side 

01:04:03.154 --> 01:04:05.154
of the United States.

01:04:07.221 --> 01:04:09.050
They were selling in Columbus 
and West Virginia, Tennessee, 

01:04:09.051 --> 01:04:12.346
places like that.  He began to 
tell all the cities where they 

01:04:12.347 --> 01:04:14.366
are located now.  They moved to 
Charlotte and they moved 

01:04:18.048 --> 01:04:19.271
to Lexington and Cincinnati 
Andean appear list, et cetera, 

01:04:19.272 --> 01:04:22.982
et cetera.  All these different 
towns on the Eastern side of the

01:04:22.983 --> 01:04:28.079
United States.  And could not 
explain why it would be that 

01:04:28.080 --> 01:04:30.327
heroin traffickers would have 
such big business, such a new 

01:04:30.328 --> 01:04:34.390
market.  I thought heroin was 
this old thing that no one 

01:04:34.391 --> 01:04:38.471
messed with anymore.  Everyone 
knew it was a disaster.  Why 

01:04:38.472 --> 01:04:40.472
would you actually mess around 
with heroin?

01:04:42.765 --> 01:04:44.409
Why would there be huge new 
numbers of people buying this 

01:04:44.410 --> 01:04:47.061
drug and using this drug?
   That's really what got me on 

01:04:47.062 --> 01:04:51.976
to the larger  story, which is 
the pain I will pes and the 

01:04:51.977 --> 01:04:53.977
opioids as we know them today.

01:04:55.453 --> 01:04:57.900
It was really an attempt to 
understand why Mexican heroin 

01:04:57.901 --> 01:04:59.957
traffickers, particularly from 
this one town where I went.

01:05:03.048 --> 01:05:05.908
I interviewed eventually a dozen
or so, ten or 12 guys who were 

01:05:05.909 --> 01:05:08.359
traffickers, all in federal 
prison from this town.

01:05:11.005 --> 01:05:13.005
And it was a way -- but I 
understood 

01:05:14.874 --> 01:05:16.874
them to be the Vanguard of this.

01:05:20.176 --> 01:05:22.395
They were the spear really 
finding the market that was then

01:05:22.396 --> 01:05:24.396
going to explode, which has now 
happened.

01:05:25.041 --> 01:05:27.285
But they found this market.  
They knew what was going to 

01:05:27.286 --> 01:05:29.286
happen 

01:05:30.395 --> 01:05:32.223
back in 1998, 1999, 2000, what 
is happening today all across 

01:05:32.224 --> 01:05:34.465
the country basically.
   » MARIE ARANA:  Could you 

01:05:34.466 --> 01:05:37.528
tell us a little bit about the 
scale?  You testified in 

01:05:37.529 --> 01:05:40.985
Congress not long ago p and I 
watched the whole hearing.  It 

01:05:40.986 --> 01:05:43.220
was absolutely fascinating.  I 
recommend it.

01:05:47.088 --> 01:05:49.088
Opioids kill people every day.

01:05:50.359 --> 01:05:52.359
In a scale, I think you said in 
the 

01:05:53.822 --> 01:05:55.665
hearing that more people are 
killed by opiates than by car 

01:05:55.666 --> 01:05:57.666
accidents in this country.  Tell
us about the scale that we are 

01:05:58.717 --> 01:06:01.982
talking about, the scale.
   » SAM QUINONES:  The scale is

01:06:01.983 --> 01:06:04.840
quite stunning, I think.  Yes, I
mean it must have been -- one 

01:06:07.951 --> 01:06:09.951
of the great moments or the 
fascinating 

01:06:11.036 --> 01:06:13.700
moments I describe in my book is
when two public health folks 

01:06:13.701 --> 01:06:15.701
from the state 

01:06:18.385 --> 01:06:20.385
of Ohio realize that there is 
about to 

01:06:21.864 --> 01:06:24.700
be a historic shift.  Since in 
modern America the automobile 

01:06:26.530 --> 01:06:29.589
already has been the leading 
cause of accidental death.  

01:06:29.590 --> 01:06:32.499
There has never been a time -- 
of course, that's gotten better,

01:06:32.500 --> 01:06:36.781
we've gotten  safer, better 
cars, et cetera.  So that number

01:06:36.782 --> 01:06:38.782
was coming down.

01:06:40.865 --> 01:06:42.865
In 2007 public health people at 
the 

01:06:45.746 --> 01:06:47.985
state ofio ofio -- owe state of 
Ohio, they figured out that was 

01:06:47.986 --> 01:06:49.986
going to end.

01:06:51.854 --> 01:06:53.854
In the state of Ohio, overdoses 
mostly 

01:06:55.136 --> 01:06:56.986
to narcotic pain pills and to 
some degree heroin at that point

01:06:56.987 --> 01:07:01.698
was over taking and going to be 
the number one cause of death.  

01:07:01.699 --> 01:07:03.699
That wasn't true in Ohio in 
2007.

01:07:05.199 --> 01:07:07.199
Then it was true nationally the 
next year.

01:07:07.428 --> 01:07:09.428
And it is a stunning thing.

01:07:10.902 --> 01:07:12.902
I think it is also very much an 
under 

01:07:16.421 --> 01:07:18.421
count because this story begins 
and is 

01:07:20.091 --> 01:07:22.091
most intensely felt in states 
with too many counties.

01:07:27.006 --> 01:07:29.006
Too many counties like Kentucky 
has 

01:07:31.518 --> 01:07:34.575
400 people, Ohio has -- West 
Virginia has ... reason the 

01:07:34.576 --> 01:07:37.008
reason that is important.  I was
a crime  reporter, started my 

01:07:38.295 --> 01:07:41.531
career in the crack days.  And 
crack was very public.  

01:07:41.532 --> 01:07:45.635
Everything about it was public. 
You couldn't avoid it.  It was 

01:07:45.636 --> 01:07:47.636
on the streets, drive-by 

01:07:50.581 --> 01:07:54.052
shootings, the gainings were 
wealthy, violent, armed.  The 

01:07:54.053 --> 01:07:56.053
homicide rate went  up.

01:07:58.117 --> 01:08:00.117
It stroyed neighborhoods.  That 
wasn't happening with this.

01:08:03.660 --> 01:08:06.979
Crime rates were dropping as the
deaths were rising.  You have 

01:08:06.980 --> 01:08:09.621
this transformation of what you 
normally think of as very quiet,

01:08:09.823 --> 01:08:12.883
right?
   The doctors were the source 

01:08:12.884 --> 01:08:14.884
of supply.

01:08:15.937 --> 01:08:17.937
I mean, this really starts with 

01:08:19.592 --> 01:08:21.856
narcotic pain killers, not 
heroin.  The traffickers come 

01:08:21.857 --> 01:08:23.857
later.

01:08:25.944 --> 01:08:27.768
American patients demand to be 
fixed, American doctors, and at 

01:08:27.769 --> 01:08:32.261
the same time you have parents 
and families wanting to hide the

01:08:32.262 --> 01:08:35.541
fact that their kids are 
addicted.  Nobody wants to 

01:08:35.542 --> 01:08:39.244
recognize that the obituaries 
are almost all fabrications.  

01:08:39.245 --> 01:08:41.244
The only place you are going to 
find this, the place where we 

01:08:41.245 --> 01:08:44.313
are going to recognize this is 
the coroner's office, the 

01:08:44.314 --> 01:08:48.624
bodies.  The problem is in these
small countries, in the states 

01:08:48.625 --> 01:08:50.625
with too many 

01:08:52.094 --> 01:08:54.094
countries, the countries -- 
counties, we 

01:08:55.779 --> 01:08:57.420
fund coroner's  offices, 
erroneously based on county tax 

01:08:57.421 --> 01:08:59.421
base.

01:09:00.689 --> 01:09:03.556
The coroner's offices are small,
under funded  frequently.  They 

01:09:03.557 --> 01:09:05.557
don't have enough doctors in 
these areas.

01:09:08.843 --> 01:09:10.843
And they are susceptible to 
family influence.

01:09:15.177 --> 01:09:17.407
So don't put that in the death 
report because it is going to 

01:09:17.408 --> 01:09:20.258
look bad for my dad or my 
brother or my child or what have

01:09:20.259 --> 01:09:22.259
you.

01:09:23.761 --> 01:09:25.761
And so what is happening today 
is 

01:09:29.699 --> 01:09:32.356
really, I believe, an enormous 
plague across the country, 

01:09:32.357 --> 01:09:34.807
certainly in large parts of the 
country it's intensely felt.

01:09:38.468 --> 01:09:40.487
That it is consuming families, 
consuming neighborhoods, 

01:09:40.488 --> 01:09:42.488
consuming football teams.

01:09:44.583 --> 01:09:47.035
Football is basically now a 
gateway to heroin addiction in 

01:09:47.036 --> 01:09:49.036
America, in my opinion.

01:09:50.524 --> 01:09:52.524
It is -- and it is also 
destroying those areas.

01:09:54.621 --> 01:09:57.498
In order for those areas to be 
great again, they have to defeat

01:09:57.499 --> 01:09:59.760
this problem.  Nobody is 
actually going to go put a 

01:10:01.795 --> 01:10:04.235
factory in some area where half 
the population can't pass a drug

01:10:04.236 --> 01:10:06.236
test.

01:10:08.324 --> 01:10:10.324
So the effect is massive and it 
is -- 

01:10:11.601 --> 01:10:13.601
but also for a long time it 
really was unseen.

01:10:15.055 --> 01:10:17.308
When my book came out, the 
health policy advisor for 

01:10:17.309 --> 01:10:21.182
Hillary Clinton called me and 
said Hillary is stunned.  This 

01:10:21.183 --> 01:10:23.183
is 2015.

01:10:25.330 --> 01:10:27.977
She is in Iowa and in New 
Hampshire and  stunned with the 

01:10:27.978 --> 01:10:31.645
ferocity with which parents are 
m coulding to her and said we 

01:10:31.646 --> 01:10:33.713
need a solution.  They almost 
didn't care about anything else.

01:10:36.568 --> 01:10:39.205
I said yes because first of all 
this is a topic that polls 

01:10:39.206 --> 01:10:43.239
poorly.  No one will admit on 
the phone this is their most 

01:10:43.240 --> 01:10:45.240
important subject, right?  They 
want to hide it.

01:10:49.208 --> 01:10:51.086
But go out there, hug people, be
a mother to people.  They need 

01:10:51.087 --> 01:10:53.087
that.

01:10:54.331 --> 01:10:56.331
You know, there are probably a 
the 

01:10:58.421 --> 01:11:00.653
look of reasons she lost, but to
that she wrote a policy position

01:11:00.654 --> 01:11:02.654
paper and that was ...

01:11:06.184 --> 01:11:08.430
so my feeling is, this is a very
hidden, even today even though 

01:11:08.431 --> 01:11:11.105
the awareness is much greater 
than it ever has been.

01:11:14.802 --> 01:11:17.255
Even today it is, we are seeing 
these icebergs and really down 

01:11:17.256 --> 01:11:19.256
below there is a massive, 
massive issue that is 

01:11:22.365 --> 01:11:24.365
everywhere in the country.

01:11:25.432 --> 01:11:27.432
» MARIE ARANA:  Veterans in pain
or people, recreational as well.

01:11:30.104 --> 01:11:32.104
It seems to do the gamut, the 
spectrum.

01:11:32.570 --> 01:11:34.570
» SAM QUINONES:  Sure, but it is
all 

01:11:35.624 --> 01:11:37.624
connected to this idea that took
hold in 

01:11:40.938 --> 01:11:42.149
the mid 1990s that promoted by 
pain specialists and by 

01:11:42.150 --> 01:11:45.042
pharmaceutical companies and 
really eagerly accepted by 

01:11:48.713 --> 01:11:51.357
us, the American health 
consumers, that narcotic pain  

01:11:51.358 --> 01:11:54.295
killers were known to be 
virtually nonaddictive when used

01:11:54.296 --> 01:11:56.296
to treat pain.

01:11:58.346 --> 01:12:00.580
Therefore, the dangerous 
corollary to that is it doesn't 

01:12:00.581 --> 01:12:04.659
matter how many of these pills 
you get prescribed and many of 

01:12:04.660 --> 01:12:06.660
you I'm sure have gone for a 
surgery, 

01:12:07.720 --> 01:12:09.720
the pain for which is going to 
last two or three days.

01:12:11.826 --> 01:12:14.285
You get 30 days worth of pills, 
right?  Multiply that by 

01:12:14.286 --> 01:12:16.286
millions of Americans every year
for 20 years.

01:12:18.352 --> 01:12:20.397
What you get is a massive supply
that has created therefore a 

01:12:20.398 --> 01:12:22.398
massive black market.

01:12:23.862 --> 01:12:26.100
So you get kids going to parties
and saying, the quarterback in 

01:12:26.101 --> 01:12:29.396
the high school football team is
taking them, damn, I'll take 

01:12:29.397 --> 01:12:33.261
them.  Most of the addiction is 
related in my opinion to supply.

01:12:36.715 --> 01:12:38.160
I used to believe that our 
addiction problems were due to 

01:12:38.161 --> 01:12:42.034
demand.  When you are in Mexico,
it's nice to believe that.  

01:12:42.035 --> 01:12:44.035
Mexicans want to believe that.

01:12:47.343 --> 01:12:49.373
It helps them wash their hands 
of our Bill nationality drug 

01:12:49.374 --> 01:12:51.374
problem.

01:12:54.278 --> 01:12:57.946
Those grinning owes up there are
hooked on dope.  I was down 

01:12:57.947 --> 01:13:00.184
there and now I'm convinced it's
a supply issue and most drug 

01:13:00.582 --> 01:13:02.582
problems are.

01:13:03.667 --> 01:13:05.355
People come to me, should we 
legalize drugs now that you've 

01:13:05.356 --> 01:13:10.224
written this book?  I'm like, 
what about this story makes you 

01:13:10.225 --> 01:13:12.675
believe we ought to legalize 
drugs?  All of this is due to 

01:13:12.676 --> 01:13:14.676
legal drugs.

01:13:16.565 --> 01:13:19.020
You unleash a vast, vast hyper, 
very potent supply of legal 

01:13:19.021 --> 01:13:21.021
drugs on the 

01:13:24.662 --> 01:13:28.708
population and you will get 
massive problems.  You know?  It

01:13:28.709 --> 01:13:31.164
was a time of fantasy.  I often 
point out these were years too 

01:13:34.619 --> 01:13:36.648
when we believed that many -- we
believed we were special and 

01:13:36.649 --> 01:13:38.940
therefore the old rules don't 
apply to us.

01:13:42.249 --> 01:13:44.249
So these were years when we 
believed 

01:13:45.321 --> 01:13:47.776
it was very common for numerous 
baseball players to hit more 

01:13:47.777 --> 01:13:50.017
than 60 home runs.  It happened 
twice and has not happened 

01:13:50.218 --> 01:13:52.660
since.  They cracked down on 
steroids, right?

01:13:55.935 --> 01:13:57.935
We believe if you package all 
these 

01:14:00.251 --> 01:14:02.251
nonperforming nasty home loans 
into one 

01:14:03.532 --> 01:14:05.532
security and Standard &amp; Poor's 
stamps 

01:14:07.661 --> 01:14:09.093
that thing AAA, that's a 
magnificent place to put your 

01:14:09.094 --> 01:14:11.094
money and we believe 

01:14:13.191 --> 01:14:15.630
that you massively prescribe 
drugs derived from the Pope yum 

01:14:15.631 --> 01:14:17.631
poppy, that 

01:14:20.728 --> 01:14:22.728
that would not concrete -- opium
poppy, 

01:14:24.604 --> 01:14:26.604
that that would not create 
massive drug addiction.

01:14:28.082 --> 01:14:30.106
Unlike the subjects of Denis 
Johnson, these are mainstream 

01:14:30.107 --> 01:14:32.107
people.

01:14:33.983 --> 01:14:35.983
I had a drug addict tell me, 
dude, it 

01:14:38.730 --> 01:14:40.730
was enough to watch make me stop
using.

01:14:43.230 --> 01:14:45.230
When the cheerleaders and 
quarterbacks started this.

01:14:48.345 --> 01:14:50.583
It was an outside, rebel thing 
but now it's very much 

01:14:50.584 --> 01:14:52.015
mainstream.
   » MARIE ARANA:  I was going 

01:14:52.016 --> 01:14:54.680
to point out, in "The Largesse 
of the Sea Maiden" 

01:14:58.966 --> 01:15:00.966
which was just published 
posthumously by 

01:15:03.476 --> 01:15:05.476
Random House, wonderful book, 
absolutely 

01:15:06.552 --> 01:15:08.552
marvelous book of short stories,
in many 

01:15:09.597 --> 01:15:11.847
ways a culmination of Denis' 
talent.  He writes about a jail 

01:15:11.848 --> 01:15:13.848
bird's ability 

01:15:15.130 --> 01:15:17.130
to get high on the most 
unexpected of substances.

01:15:19.210 --> 01:15:21.057
At one point somebody brings in 
a newspaper soaked in LSD and 

01:15:21.058 --> 01:15:23.494
everybody thinks that's a 
newspaper, except that it is 

01:15:23.495 --> 01:15:25.326
satisfying.
   This is a very different 

01:15:25.327 --> 01:15:27.327
thing that you are describing.

01:15:31.481 --> 01:15:33.112
This is not -- it is --
   » SAM QUINONES:  This is 

01:15:33.113 --> 01:15:35.985
almost entirely white people.  
It starts in appear latch I 

01:15:35.986 --> 01:15:37.986
can't in 

01:15:39.429 --> 01:15:41.429
the Russ belt of course is -- in
the 

01:15:43.765 --> 01:15:46.430
rust belt where we are very 
eager to ig norp and did ignore,

01:15:46.431 --> 01:15:48.431
but by the time I 

01:15:49.686 --> 01:15:53.459
got on to the story it had 
spread far, far beyond that.  

01:15:53.460 --> 01:15:55.460
Spread across America and spread

01:15:56.704 --> 01:15:59.152
stunningly in my opinion, to 
some of the very  nicest 

01:15:59.153 --> 01:16:01.153
suburbs.

01:16:02.236 --> 01:16:05.706
Orange County is our heroin 
Beltway in L.A. now.  Some of 

01:16:05.707 --> 01:16:07.707
the nicest suburbs where people 
had done best in the economic 

01:16:11.407 --> 01:16:14.276
expansions of the say previous 
20 or 30 years.  I always 

01:16:14.277 --> 01:16:17.152
thought it was stunning in those
areas people were getting 

01:16:17.153 --> 01:16:19.153
addicted 

01:16:20.220 --> 01:16:22.220
and dying from drugs used to 
numb pain.

01:16:23.473 --> 01:16:25.555
You look at lives and you go 
what pain exactly do you feel?  

01:16:25.556 --> 01:16:27.556
It's a perfect  life.

01:16:29.639 --> 01:16:31.669
In the history of the world, .
0001 percent have lived, of the 

01:16:31.670 --> 01:16:33.912
people ever to exist have lived 
as well as you.

01:16:36.972 --> 01:16:38.972
And you've got, you know, to use
these 

01:16:40.219 --> 01:16:42.219
drugs to -- but I mean, I think 
that's 

01:16:44.709 --> 01:16:46.709
kind of the story that I 
initially 

01:16:48.008 --> 01:16:50.008
believed that I was writing the 
great 

01:16:51.064 --> 01:16:52.900
American American drug  
trarvegging story.  I was a 

01:16:52.901 --> 01:16:54.901
crime writer.  That's all I want
to do.

01:16:58.202 --> 01:16:59.622
I wanted to write about Mexico 
and these gainings and 

01:16:59.623 --> 01:17:01.623
everything.

01:17:02.665 --> 01:17:04.713
Yes, this is certainly that 
story but there is a whole lot 

01:17:04.714 --> 01:17:08.192
more to it.  There's really -- 
what it comes down to is not 

01:17:08.193 --> 01:17:10.193
economics.

01:17:11.550 --> 01:17:13.594
How do you say a rust belt town 
in Charlotte North Carolina have

01:17:13.595 --> 01:17:16.437
the same problem and make it 
economic -- it is not an 

01:17:16.438 --> 01:17:18.671
economic story.
   What it really has to do 

01:17:18.672 --> 01:17:24.165
with, I believe, my common 
denominator, the best I can come

01:17:24.166 --> 01:17:27.011
up with, is our own deep and pro
found isolation and destruction 

01:17:27.012 --> 01:17:29.012
of 

01:17:32.715 --> 01:17:35.381
community, which is why I chose 
the pool, swimming pool in a 

01:17:35.382 --> 01:17:37.382
small town 

01:17:39.051 --> 01:17:41.051
called Portsmouth Ohio on the 
Ohio river 

01:17:42.704 --> 01:17:46.333
for the metaphor really, the 
central image of the book.  The 

01:17:46.334 --> 01:17:48.595
name of the pool was dream land 
and the pool was a place where 

01:17:48.596 --> 01:17:50.596
everyone came together and grew 
up.

01:17:53.711 --> 01:17:55.711
It was a steel mill and shoe 
factory 

01:17:57.177 --> 01:17:59.037
and bustling Main Street and 
50,000 people.  The pool is 

01:17:59.038 --> 01:18:02.299
where they came together and 
formed community.  Then the 

01:18:02.300 --> 01:18:07.409
steel mill leaves.  The shoe 
factories leave.  The Main 

01:18:07.410 --> 01:18:09.246
Street just empties out, classic
fashion.  Half the town leaves.

01:18:09.247 --> 01:18:11.708
   Then everyone retreats 
indoors.

01:18:15.190 --> 01:18:17.679
Finally they can't sustain it 
and dig up and destroy 

01:18:17.680 --> 01:18:19.680
"Dreamland" and replace 

01:18:22.833 --> 01:18:24.833
it with a strip mall and an 
O'Reilly's 

01:18:26.085 --> 01:18:28.085
auto parts store as the anchor 
tenant.

01:18:28.942 --> 01:18:30.942
They become exposed not unlike, 
I 

01:18:32.824 --> 01:18:34.824
believe, the Indians when the 
Europeans brought smallpox.

01:18:37.322 --> 01:18:39.322
They had no bulwark, community 
bulwark to keep this at bay.

01:18:41.826 --> 01:18:43.677
I think that is what we are 
dealing with now in a deeper 

01:18:43.678 --> 01:18:45.678
sense.

01:18:49.200 --> 01:18:50.416
Kind of with this opioid 
epidemic that is coast to coast.

01:18:50.417 --> 01:18:52.417
   » MARIE ARANA:  This is what 
struck 

01:18:54.932 --> 01:18:56.932
me about your hearing and I want
to bring Jon into this.

01:18:59.638 --> 01:19:01.638
You said in the hearing that it 
was at 

01:19:03.748 --> 01:19:05.748
that point where families from 
all kinds 

01:19:08.202 --> 01:19:10.202
of classes classes would get 
together and mix.

01:19:12.507 --> 01:19:14.507
This was their community coming 
together.

01:19:17.015 --> 01:19:19.042
And a kind of real connectedness
there.

01:19:26.989 --> 01:19:28.414
So much of what Jon writes about
is  disconnectedness, where you 

01:19:28.415 --> 01:19:31.288
are out of connection really 
because your marriage 

01:19:37.565 --> 01:19:39.565
is falling apart, your economy

01:19:40.795 --> 01:19:43.945
has gone bust and you don't have
a job in the mining town.

01:19:50.820 --> 01:19:52.820
So my question is

01:19:56.007 --> 01:19:58.007
and this is a Pollyanna 
question, I 

01:19:59.657 --> 01:20:01.713
admit:  Fix the malaise, fix the
problem, fix the 

01:20:01.714 --> 01:20:03.714
disconnectedness.  Jon, what do 
you think?

01:20:06.809 --> 01:20:09.057
And you start to -- you actually
said in the hearing, Sam, you 

01:20:09.058 --> 01:20:12.539
said we've got to get back to 
that.  We have to get back to 

01:20:12.540 --> 01:20:14.540
that connection and that 
community.

01:20:15.014 --> 01:20:18.499
What do you think, Jon?
   » JONATHAN FRANZEN:  I would 

01:20:21.563 --> 01:20:22.994
respectfully disagree that I 
write about dysfunctional 

01:20:22.995 --> 01:20:24.995
families.

01:20:26.679 --> 01:20:29.115
I think the dysfunctional 
families are likely to be found 

01:20:29.116 --> 01:20:31.780
where there is substance.
   » SAM QUINONES:  Uh-huh.

01:20:33.209 --> 01:20:35.038
» JONATHAN FRANZEN:  In fact, I 
write about  highly functional 

01:20:35.039 --> 01:20:37.039
families.

01:20:39.332 --> 01:20:43.244
The children are taken care of, 
not dropped on their head.  No 

01:20:43.245 --> 01:20:47.920
drug addictions.
   I'm an old leftist.  We have 

01:20:47.921 --> 01:20:49.921
been ground between the twin 

01:20:51.800 --> 01:20:53.800
grinding plates of consumerism 
and kind  

01:20:55.311 --> 01:20:57.362
of -- which is an atomizing 
force.  It makes the individual 

01:20:57.363 --> 01:21:01.626
consumer the most important 
thing.  And in fact, I would 

01:21:01.627 --> 01:21:05.717
actually flip it around and say 
the reason I'm writing about 

01:21:05.718 --> 01:21:08.610
families, I think of the family 
as the one thing you can't -- no

01:21:08.611 --> 01:21:12.485
matter how hard the two plates 
grind, you can't actually 

01:21:12.486 --> 01:21:15.121
dissolve the family bond.  If 
you are interested in 

01:21:15.122 --> 01:21:17.122
psychological 

01:21:18.189 --> 01:21:20.841
intensity in a novel which is 
kind of cat nip for me, you are 

01:21:20.842 --> 01:21:23.720
naturally drawn to the family.  
That's one of the few places you

01:21:23.721 --> 01:21:28.206
can find it.  You won't find it 
at the community level or 

01:21:28.207 --> 01:21:31.291
friendship level because of 
this.  So yeah, I do think that 

01:21:31.292 --> 01:21:33.292
this -- then, 

01:21:34.964 --> 01:21:36.964
of course, corporate 
pharmaceutical 

01:21:38.006 --> 01:21:39.263
forces and all of those things 
you were mentioning and the 

01:21:39.264 --> 01:21:42.132
financial industry, the worst of
capitalism is piling on to 

01:21:45.184 --> 01:21:47.184
make these things worse.
   » SAM QUINONES:  Heroin is 

01:21:48.860 --> 01:21:50.860
interesting to me because it 
dawned on 

01:21:51.904 --> 01:21:53.735
me, piggybacking on what you 
say, if you are a culture that 

01:21:53.736 --> 01:21:55.773
believes that stuff will buy you
happiness, the final stuff 

01:21:58.814 --> 01:22:00.814
that could potentially buy you 
happiness 

01:22:02.518 --> 01:22:04.518
is this cruddy stuff that you 
inject in your vein.

01:22:05.788 --> 01:22:07.788
It is a final expression, that 
philosophy of living.

01:22:10.270 --> 01:22:12.699
» JONATHAN FRANZEN:  You are on 
the Hedonic treadmill.  You are 

01:22:12.700 --> 01:22:14.533
--
   » SAM QUINONES:  It's never 

01:22:14.534 --> 01:22:14.739
happiness.
   » JONATHAN FRANZEN:  Of 

01:22:14.740 --> 01:22:20.255
course.  It makes you feel like 
you've attained it a moment.  

01:22:20.256 --> 01:22:21.260
Until then you haven't attained 
it anymore.  You have to get 

01:22:21.261 --> 01:22:26.351
back.  What I found interesting,
frankly, was that the same guys,

01:22:26.352 --> 01:22:28.380
the Mexican guys I was writing  
about, they never used their 

01:22:28.381 --> 01:22:32.250
dope.  They would use cocaine.  
They would drink, but they never

01:22:32.251 --> 01:22:35.331
used their dope.  But they were 
also addicted.

01:22:38.968 --> 01:22:40.968
They were addicted to, as poor 
young 

01:22:42.626 --> 01:22:44.255
men, leaving home, being poor in
Mexico is not just about having 

01:22:44.256 --> 01:22:46.256
not very much money.

01:22:47.913 --> 01:22:50.371
It's also being humiliated for 
not having very much money.  

01:22:50.372 --> 01:22:54.228
They would come home with money.
That was their narcotic.  They 

01:22:54.229 --> 01:22:56.834
would accumulate one of the 
things that they loved to 

01:22:56.835 --> 01:22:59.745
accumulate was Levis 501 jeans 
because those were the 

01:23:03.844 --> 01:23:05.844
classic, rural gold standard for
rural 

01:23:07.925 --> 01:23:09.925
men's wear when I was there in 
Mexico, Levis 501 jeans.

01:23:14.458 --> 01:23:16.900
And all of the narcotics dealers
would trade them for the dope, 

01:23:16.901 --> 01:23:19.557
take the jeans home and give 
them away like Santa Claus.

01:23:21.839 --> 01:23:23.839
All these guys who they had 
grown up 

01:23:25.356 --> 01:23:26.981
with, all the girls want to talk
to them.  All these men would 

01:23:26.982 --> 01:23:30.248
come and talk to them about 
loans.  That's a good thing, you

01:23:30.249 --> 01:23:33.727
don't get asked for loans unless
you have money to actually give 

01:23:33.728 --> 01:23:35.549
them.
   There's this feeling 

01:23:35.550 --> 01:23:37.550
throughout the research that I 
had that everybody was 

01:23:42.276 --> 01:23:44.131
kind of addicted to something, 
but it was not -- they were 

01:23:44.132 --> 01:23:46.132
looking for happiness.

01:23:47.840 --> 01:23:50.278
The truth is, happiness, this is
pleasure.  Happiness doesn't 

01:23:50.279 --> 01:23:54.814
come from that.  It's all that 
consumer culture that you are 

01:23:54.815 --> 01:23:57.461
referring to that I think is a 
very, very big part of our life 

01:23:57.462 --> 01:23:58.682
here.
   » MARIE ARANA:  It's almost 

01:23:58.683 --> 01:24:01.956
like it actually is reminding me
of something that Denis wrote.

01:24:07.044 --> 01:24:09.044
That sort of vulture feeling 
certainly.

01:24:12.966 --> 01:24:15.007
His journalism in Liberia and he
-- I can't remember if this was 

01:24:15.008 --> 01:24:17.008
for Esquire 

01:24:18.273 --> 01:24:20.273
magazine or what it was for but 
he was 

01:24:21.316 --> 01:24:23.316
describing the tremendously 
nightmareish 

01:24:28.088 --> 01:24:31.372
war in which the dogs are 
looking very prosperous.  And 

01:24:31.373 --> 01:24:33.830
the people are starving.  And 
the reason why the dogs are 

01:24:36.293 --> 01:24:38.936
looking so prosperous is, of 
course, they are feeding on the 

01:24:38.937 --> 01:24:42.609
Corpses.  I don't know why, and 
it's a very, very dark image.

01:24:42.610 --> 01:24:46.064
   (Laughter.)
   » SAM QUINONES:  You can say 

01:24:46.065 --> 01:24:48.065
that again.

01:24:49.755 --> 01:24:52.243
» MARIE ARANA:  But it suggests 
to me, and Elliot maybe could 

01:24:52.244 --> 01:24:54.244
comment on 

01:24:59.963 --> 01:25:01.963
this, that it is almost a 
metaphor that

01:25:03.683 --> 01:25:06.337
in the consumer business.  It 
also, you know, in the business 

01:25:06.338 --> 01:25:08.338
of 

01:25:11.976 --> 01:25:15.398
war, that there are Corpses all 
about.  People are dying.

01:25:19.474 --> 01:25:21.474
It's a crisis, just in the 
newspaper 

01:25:23.762 --> 01:25:26.440
today the headline, nearly 1 
million people, mains are not 

01:25:26.441 --> 01:25:29.331
working because they are too 
sick from opioids.

01:25:31.389 --> 01:25:34.077
Last year it was 70,000 people 
dead.  The year before that it 

01:25:34.078 --> 01:25:36.729
was 64,000 people dead, more 
than the Vietnam War.

01:25:42.879 --> 01:25:44.879
There is this sense of the 
industry 

01:25:47.151 --> 01:25:49.599
devouring almost in a sort of 
war-like way the victims.

01:25:55.530 --> 01:25:58.182
And there seems to be a failure 
afoot of responsibility in the 

01:25:58.183 --> 01:26:02.676
sense that what could we have 
done?  Where could we stop it?  

01:26:02.677 --> 01:26:04.677
What can we do now?

01:26:05.747 --> 01:26:08.602
A little bit of a war theme, I 
would think.  Elliot?

01:26:11.286 --> 01:26:13.286
» ELLIOT ACKERMAN:  Yeah, sorry.

01:26:15.182 --> 01:26:17.182
I think definitely what you -- I
mean, 

01:26:21.523 --> 01:26:24.018
you know, wars build their own 
economies.  I'm sure you've seen

01:26:24.019 --> 01:26:27.897
this in your reporting.  We have
an American conception of war as

01:26:27.898 --> 01:26:29.898
war begins.  It is fought for a 
cause.

01:26:32.217 --> 01:26:35.499
It ends and somebody wins and 
somebody losses.  The reason 

01:26:35.500 --> 01:26:37.977
we're in the 17th year, for 
instance, of fighting in 

01:26:37.978 --> 01:26:40.012
Afghanistan is not because we 
haven't found that 

01:26:43.258 --> 01:26:45.496
perfect bit of alchemy my to 
defeat the Taliban or whoever we

01:26:45.497 --> 01:26:47.937
decided the enemy is.  You get 
into the cycle where the war 

01:26:49.549 --> 01:26:53.238
just feeds upon itself.  Why is 
that?  One part can be the 

01:26:53.239 --> 01:26:55.239
internal dynamics 

01:26:56.499 --> 01:26:58.359
in Afghanistan or in Iraq and 
all those reasons we feel are 

01:26:58.360 --> 01:27:00.360
very, very far away.

01:27:01.637 --> 01:27:03.637
If we turned the light on 
ourselves, 

01:27:04.926 --> 01:27:06.545
it's because every war you go 
to, you go to war with a 

01:27:06.546 --> 01:27:10.217
construct.  Whether it's the 
national mobilization that 

01:27:10.218 --> 01:27:12.445
existed in the second world war,
where the entire country got 

01:27:12.446 --> 01:27:17.131
behind the effort, to the draft 
in the Vietnam War, to today 

01:27:17.132 --> 01:27:20.003
where we are fighting wars that 
are resourced with an all 

01:27:20.004 --> 01:27:25.507
volunteer military and funded 
through deficit spending.  Kind 

01:27:25.508 --> 01:27:27.946
of like your pain killers, you 
don't feel a thing and it goes 

01:27:27.947 --> 01:27:30.626
on and on and on and on.

01:27:33.688 --> 01:27:36.761
   » JONATHAN FRANZEN:  Sam, is 
it your impression, you say it's

01:27:36.762 --> 01:27:41.469
about supply.  That seems to 
imply that these are people who 

01:27:41.470 --> 01:27:43.470
if they hadn't happened to 

01:27:44.514 --> 01:27:46.748
have access to the opioids, they
would have had good success full

01:27:46.749 --> 01:27:48.591
satisfying lives?
   » SAM QUINONES:  Yeah.  It's 

01:27:48.592 --> 01:27:50.592
hard to say.  You're right.
   (Overlapping speakers.)

01:27:51.837 --> 01:27:54.488
» JONATHAN FRANZEN:  I mean, the
mention of Afghanistan puts me 

01:27:54.489 --> 01:27:57.148
in mind -- as I said, we were 
talking back stage.

01:28:00.413 --> 01:28:02.669
There is an overlap between 
areas of -- certainly where the 

01:28:02.670 --> 01:28:05.734
opioid crisis first made itself 
particularly visible and Trump 

01:28:05.735 --> 01:28:10.825
America.  That there is a kind 
of despair and kind of let's 

01:28:10.826 --> 01:28:13.481
burn it all down quality.  That 
is absolutely what happens if 

01:28:13.482 --> 01:28:15.543
you tear up a country with 17 
years of war.

01:28:19.387 --> 01:28:20.612
There is like why not keep 
fighting?

01:28:20.613 --> 01:28:22.674
» ELLIOT ACKERMAN:  But there is
also a sense in what you were 

01:28:22.675 --> 01:28:24.675
talking about 

01:28:26.737 --> 01:28:29.607
too, which is this fan tastia we
are living in.  We can have 

01:28:29.608 --> 01:28:31.608
opioid drugs and everything will
be fine.

01:28:34.113 --> 01:28:36.113
Also the sense of oh, yeah, we 
can 

01:28:37.392 --> 01:28:40.669
hollow out our institutions and 
we'll be psychologically okay.  

01:28:40.670 --> 01:28:42.938
We'll resource our wars out to 
other people and pay taxes and 

01:28:42.939 --> 01:28:44.939
it will be fine.  It was 
probably a good thing that we 

01:28:47.843 --> 01:28:50.100
had a draft in the '60s and 
everybody got to a point where 

01:28:50.101 --> 01:28:52.732
they said this makes no sense, 
we are not doing dit anymore.

01:28:53.367 --> 01:28:57.456
   » JONATHAN FRANZEN:  Exactly.
100 percent.  I said this in 

01:28:57.457 --> 01:28:59.675
fact in talks that I have been 
giving around the country about 

01:28:59.676 --> 01:29:01.676
this.

01:29:03.141 --> 01:29:05.141
That it is like -- yeah, we just
have 

01:29:07.833 --> 01:29:10.088
this -- the whole theme really 
is to me, I thought again it was

01:29:10.089 --> 01:29:12.089
drug traffics.  It is not that.

01:29:13.942 --> 01:29:16.795
It's isolation versus community.
You know, we used to treat pain 

01:29:16.796 --> 01:29:19.849
in a variety of ways.  One 
person would get a variety of 

01:29:19.850 --> 01:29:22.712
approaches.  So it would be, you
have pain, chronic paper.

01:29:25.886 --> 01:29:27.886
Well, cognitive behavioral 
therapy, diet, swimming.   Pain?

01:29:28.322 --> 01:29:31.406
Marital counseling!  You need 
that.  Marriage is pain!

01:29:31.407 --> 01:29:34.270
(Laughter.)
   » SAM QUINONES:  Seriously, 

01:29:34.271 --> 01:29:36.726
that's why part of what went 
into ...

01:29:39.789 --> 01:29:42.031
but then the pills took up all 
the, we began to believe in easy

01:29:42.032 --> 01:29:45.487
answers to complicated problems.
We began to -- I told an 

01:29:45.488 --> 01:29:49.157
audience the other day, I can't 
remember where it was now, that 

01:29:49.158 --> 01:29:51.409
one of the worst things we ever 
did was go to war and then give 

01:29:52.841 --> 01:29:54.841
ourselves a tax cut.

01:29:56.901 --> 01:29:58.334
It's like we didn't really, this
one infinitesimal part of our 

01:29:58.335 --> 01:30:03.231
population was going over there 
to risk their lives to fight the

01:30:03.232 --> 01:30:05.232
war and we were not supposed to 
feel anything.

01:30:08.946 --> 01:30:10.997
We want to be  narcotized and 
immune.  What is very important 

01:30:10.998 --> 01:30:14.251
in all of this, we were not 
asked to be accountable and with

01:30:14.252 --> 01:30:19.771
pain either.  We were not asked 
to say you know, when you have 

01:30:19.772 --> 01:30:21.772
chronic pains, very often 

01:30:23.244 --> 01:30:25.494
it has to do with your own 
personal consumer  decisions.  

01:30:25.495 --> 01:30:28.346
You don't get enough exercise.  
You eat poorly, smoke, drink, ar

01:30:29.161 --> 01:30:31.403
variety of things.
   Doctors found the patients 

01:30:31.404 --> 01:30:33.404
don't want to hear that.

01:30:35.272 --> 01:30:38.322
So they just said doc, I want 
you to fix me.  You're the car 

01:30:38.323 --> 01:30:40.323
mechanic, my body is a car.  Fix
me.

01:30:41.624 --> 01:30:43.624
We got into this attitude that I

01:30:47.476 --> 01:30:49.476
believe was also very kind of 
just a

01:30:50.627 --> 01:30:52.924
Narcotized attitude that we 
don't want to have to deal with 

01:30:52.925 --> 01:30:55.789
our own  decisions or change our
way of living and part of 

01:30:59.445 --> 01:31:01.445
it was when we went to war and 
took -- 

01:31:02.908 --> 01:31:04.943
and we're happy to get a tax 
cut.  One of the lowest points 

01:31:04.944 --> 01:31:09.023
in our culture frankly was right
there, really was a very sad 

01:31:09.024 --> 01:31:13.085
day, I thought.

01:31:14.115 --> 01:31:16.139
» MARIE ARANA:  Before we move 
on to the last segment of this 

01:31:16.140 --> 01:31:18.140
program I want 

01:31:19.822 --> 01:31:21.822
to thank these extraordinary 
writers who 

01:31:24.761 --> 01:31:26.761
in one way or another speak to I
think 

01:31:28.669 --> 01:31:30.669
Denis John's work, his sort of 
miles an 

01:31:31.887 --> 01:31:37.257
hour rack miles an hour ac 
allows ability to take -- miles 

01:31:37.258 --> 01:31:40.141
an hour ac allows themes that we
have talked about here and merge

01:31:40.142 --> 01:31:45.021
them into the spectacular  
literature.  Thank you to 

01:31:45.022 --> 01:31:47.022
Jonathan Franzen, thank 

01:31:48.692 --> 01:31:51.359
you to Elliot Ackerman, thank 
you to Sam Quinones.  Before we 

01:31:51.360 --> 01:31:53.615
move on to the next part of the 
program, the very tail end.

01:31:56.688 --> 01:31:58.688
Thank you so much for coming.
   (Applause.

01:31:59.692 --> 01:32:01.692
)

01:32:16.971 --> 01:32:19.202
» MARIE ARANA:  Now to tell us 
about the personal, more 

01:32:19.203 --> 01:32:21.203
personal side of 

01:32:22.470 --> 01:32:24.925
Denis Johnson I want to welcome 
Elizabeth Cuthrell to come and 

01:32:24.926 --> 01:32:30.441
talk about her personal 
recollections and her work in 

01:32:30.442 --> 01:32:32.442
film with Denis.  Elizabeth, 
please.

01:32:36.119 --> 01:32:38.119
)

01:32:41.694 --> 01:32:43.920
   » ELIZABETH CUTHRELL:  Good 
evening, everybody.  Thank you 

01:32:43.921 --> 01:32:46.790
for being here.  I think I'm 
going to usher in a different 

01:32:46.791 --> 01:32:49.049
tone.  I hope that's okay.

01:32:53.542 --> 01:32:55.585
I first met Denis in 1997 when 
my partners and I were writing 

01:32:55.586 --> 01:32:59.661
the screen play for geez sus' 
son.  We were just starting out 

01:32:59.662 --> 01:33:01.662
in the film business.  It was 
our first project.

01:33:04.766 --> 01:33:07.194
I was a huge fan of Denis' work.
I had somehow convinced him in a

01:33:07.195 --> 01:33:09.658
phone call to let us take a 
whack at the script.

01:33:12.315 --> 01:33:15.363
I promised him if he hated it we
wouldn't make the movie.  And he

01:33:15.364 --> 01:33:20.685
knew I men it.  We sent him the 
first draft.  He loved it.  He 

01:33:20.686 --> 01:33:24.365
asked to come to New York City 
to meet us.  He ambled into the 

01:33:24.366 --> 01:33:26.366
meeting wearing a 

01:33:28.462 --> 01:33:30.902
vintage a low ha shirt, red 
cowboy boots and Elvis Presley 

01:33:30.903 --> 01:33:33.144
glasses held together in the 
middle by tape.

01:33:36.849 --> 01:33:39.493
I was terrified and thrilled to 
meet this genius whose book we 

01:33:39.494 --> 01:33:41.741
were adapting.  He seemed shy 
and amused at the same 

01:33:45.609 --> 01:33:47.609
time, but what I remember most 
was his generosity.

01:33:49.537 --> 01:33:51.792
He marveled at our a daptation 
and talked to us like we were 

01:33:51.793 --> 01:33:53.821
the geniuses and he was the kid 
just starting out.

01:33:55.863 --> 01:33:57.083
I asked him if he would be 
willing to play a part in the 

01:33:57.084 --> 01:34:02.822
film.  He said only if I can 
play Terrence Weber, the guy 

01:34:02.823 --> 01:34:04.823
with the knife in his eye
   (Laughter.)

01:34:05.071 --> 01:34:07.320
» ELIZABETH CUTHRELL:  He added 
that way, if I hate the movie I 

01:34:07.321 --> 01:34:08.941
can use my performance as a 
metaphor.

01:34:08.942 --> 01:34:12.196
(Laughter.)
   » ELIZABETH CUTHRELL:  A year

01:34:12.197 --> 01:34:17.533
later we were on the film set 
together.  Denis was abusive.  

01:34:17.534 --> 01:34:20.608
He kept saying this is exactly 
what it looked like.  This is 

01:34:20.609 --> 01:34:22.609
exactly what it felt like.

01:34:24.486 --> 01:34:26.486
(Effusive.

01:34:28.798 --> 01:34:31.458
) Jack black and Billy crud up 
are in the hospital, hammered on

01:34:31.459 --> 01:34:36.781
just a cocktail of uppers and 
downers when a guy named 

01:34:36.782 --> 01:34:39.848
Terrence Weber, played by Denis 
Johnson, arrives.  Here is the 

01:34:39.849 --> 01:34:41.849
clip.

01:34:44.079 --> 01:34:46.079
(Movie played

01:34:47.426 --> 01:34:49.045
.)
   »:  I have been working in 

01:34:49.046 --> 01:34:51.046
the emergency ward for about 
three weeks, I guess.

01:34:53.950 --> 01:34:56.201
I had taken the job because 
Michelle was pregnant and I was 

01:34:56.202 --> 01:34:58.238
trying to be responsible.
   I had nothing to do on the 

01:34:58.239 --> 01:35:00.239
overnight shift.

01:35:02.356 --> 01:35:05.029
I went bloking for George gi, 
the orderly.  He often killed 

01:35:05.030 --> 01:35:06.854
spills.
   »:  What am I going to do 

01:35:06.855 --> 01:35:10.954
about these fucking shoes, man? 
(Music.

01:35:13.956 --> 01:35:18.299
)
   »:  Whatever you stole, I 

01:35:18.300 --> 01:35:20.300
guess you ate it already, right?

01:35:26.861 --> 01:35:29.739
   »:  
   (Movie captioned.   

01:38:04.890 --> 01:38:06.890
   (Applause.

01:38:08.148 --> 01:38:10.148
)

01:38:12.127 --> 01:38:14.127
   » ELIZABETH CUTHRELL:  Thank 
you.

01:38:16.409 --> 01:38:18.452
Collaborating with Denis on his 
stuff was like stepping into 

01:38:18.453 --> 01:38:22.336
another world.  Something in me 
would always get rearranged, 

01:38:22.337 --> 01:38:27.019
opened, challenged.  We worked 
on a bunch of projects together 

01:38:27.020 --> 01:38:29.887
over the years and were cooking 
up new ideas right up until the 

01:38:29.888 --> 01:38:32.754
end.
   Denis was fierce about 

01:38:32.755 --> 01:38:35.413
protecting his work.  If 
somebody tried to change, cut or

01:38:36.849 --> 01:38:39.293
wrongly interpret his writing he
would be crushed but also do 

01:38:39.294 --> 01:38:42.356
what he had to do to protect it.
   At a production of one of his

01:38:42.357 --> 01:38:46.421
plays in Chicago he arrived for 
the final dress rehearsal and 

01:38:46.422 --> 01:38:48.659
was stunned to realize the 
director decided to use this 

01:38:52.361 --> 01:38:54.181
kind of sound machine to weave a
creepy weird background sound 

01:38:54.182 --> 01:38:56.182
into the production.  Denis 
hated it.

01:38:58.251 --> 01:38:59.677
He spoke to the director and 
producer, but they wouldn't 

01:38:59.678 --> 01:39:01.678
budge.

01:39:02.947 --> 01:39:05.381
So as a last desperate measure, 
that night after everyone had 

01:39:05.382 --> 01:39:06.830
left, he snuck back into the 
theater

01:39:06.831 --> 01:39:08.896
(Laughter.)
   » ELIZABETH CUTHRELL:  -- 

01:39:08.897 --> 01:39:13.019
stuck the sound machine under 
his jacket, went out and pitched

01:39:13.020 --> 01:39:15.502
it into the river.
   (Laughter.)

01:39:16.114 --> 01:39:17.962
» ELIZABETH CUTHRELL:  Needless 
to say he was locked out of the 

01:39:17.963 --> 01:39:19.963
theater from then on.

01:39:22.688 --> 01:39:25.350
In his writing, Denis could be 
mercyless but as a friend he was

01:39:25.750 --> 01:39:27.750
profoundly kind.

01:39:29.265 --> 01:39:31.546
He saw into you but didn't judge
you.  When you made a bad choice

01:39:31.547 --> 01:39:33.547
he would 

01:39:34.629 --> 01:39:37.070
help you find something heroic 
about it.  He was awake and 

01:39:37.071 --> 01:39:42.163
aware and in my opinion hooked 
up to some sacred line.  There 

01:39:42.164 --> 01:39:44.164
were no layers on him.

01:39:45.278 --> 01:39:46.913
He felt everything, every 
infirmity in detail and at the 

01:39:46.914 --> 01:39:48.914
speed of light and that can't be
easy.

01:39:50.596 --> 01:39:52.843
Whenever I asked him how he was,
he would always say I'm getting 

01:39:52.844 --> 01:39:54.844
better and better every day.

01:39:56.910 --> 01:39:59.370
And in one of our very last 
email exchanges he wrote:  I 

01:39:59.371 --> 01:40:01.371
thought late life was supposed 
to be  boring.

01:40:03.880 --> 01:40:05.880
I'm finding it more like a trip 
over Niagara Falls.

01:40:07.335 --> 01:40:09.335
He sometimes sent me emails that
read like prayers.

01:40:11.403 --> 01:40:13.477
Here is one:  Elizabeth, my 
darling sister, the other night 

01:40:13.478 --> 01:40:17.344
I was up for a couple of hours 
around 2:00 a.m.  I call it the 

01:40:17.345 --> 01:40:22.456
night watch.  Sometimes it's the
best part of the day.  I had an 

01:40:22.457 --> 01:40:26.768
insight that I wish I could have
held on to.  That everything is 

01:40:26.769 --> 01:40:28.769
renewed, replenished, 
perpetually.

01:40:31.271 --> 01:40:34.164
That's what we are, that 
replenishing.  I'm not the one 

01:40:34.165 --> 01:40:38.537
being renewed.  I'm the renewing
itself.  I'm not the one being 

01:40:38.538 --> 01:40:44.514
healed.  I'm the process of 
healing.  That's the true me.  I

01:40:44.515 --> 01:40:46.766
felt it, this truth, vividly.  I
was living it for a little  

01:40:46.767 --> 01:40:48.767
while.

01:40:50.040 --> 01:40:52.496
Now it's just a concept again, 
but a sweet one.  And here I 

01:40:52.497 --> 01:40:54.556
pass it on to you.

01:40:58.222 --> 01:41:00.063
Denis' openness and sensitivity 
sometimes made it hard for him 

01:41:00.064 --> 01:41:02.064
to deal 

01:41:03.150 --> 01:41:06.641
with the rest of us, especially 
the crazy business side of art. 

01:41:06.642 --> 01:41:08.642
He told me when he was in L.A.

01:41:11.776 --> 01:41:13.776
trying to get work made after 
"Tree of 

01:41:16.505 --> 01:41:18.352
Smoke" came out, they would 
proudly introduce them to each 

01:41:18.353 --> 01:41:21.419
other as Dave and say this is 
Dave.  He won the National Book 

01:41:21.420 --> 01:41:23.420
Award.
   (Laughter.

01:41:24.702 --> 01:41:26.702
) these kinds of experiences 
encouraged 

01:41:28.369 --> 01:41:30.850
him to retreat back to Idaho or 
Arizona and earn his reputation 

01:41:30.851 --> 01:41:35.011
as being reclusive.  But there 
was something about the process 

01:41:35.012 --> 01:41:37.261
of making plays, screen plays 
and tele-plays that brought out 

01:41:37.262 --> 01:41:39.262
a part 

01:41:41.564 --> 01:41:44.010
of Denis that was jazz and 
collaborative and social and he 

01:41:44.011 --> 01:41:48.291
couldn't stay away from.  He 
loved actors.  He would 

01:41:48.292 --> 01:41:51.145
sometimes go into ecstatic 
states listening to them make 

01:41:51.146 --> 01:41:53.146
sense of his work.

01:41:54.824 --> 01:41:56.881
Here is part of an email:  
Elizabeth what a privilege to 

01:41:56.882 --> 01:42:00.364
sit in the room and watch these 
geniuses at work.  Afterwards 

01:42:00.365 --> 01:42:02.365
they talk about their 

01:42:03.645 --> 01:42:05.645
dinner plans head for an hour's 
subway ride.

01:42:07.519 --> 01:42:08.534
Go on as if it's possible to go 
on after an experience like 

01:42:08.535 --> 01:42:12.425
that.  I go back to the 
apartment.  Ten minute walk, and

01:42:12.426 --> 01:42:16.515
try not to dissolve into the 
galaxies.

01:42:21.066 --> 01:42:23.066
Lastly, I want to talk just for 
a 

01:42:24.123 --> 01:42:26.177
moment about Denis' wife Cindy 
Lee Johnson.  There is no 

01:42:26.178 --> 01:42:29.250
talking about Denis without 
talking about Cindy.  She was 

01:42:29.251 --> 01:42:31.251
his beloved.

01:42:33.156 --> 01:42:35.156
When he spoke about her and 
their 

01:42:37.053 --> 01:42:38.903
kids, beautiful daughter Lana 
who is here tonight it was like 

01:42:38.904 --> 01:42:42.162
he was channeling sunlight.  
Cindy took care of everything 

01:42:42.163 --> 01:42:44.448
the world demanded of Denis so 
he could make art.

01:42:49.142 --> 01:42:51.142
She was his Buoy.

01:42:52.228 --> 01:42:54.878
Once Cindy took over the 
checkbook, the repo man stopped 

01:42:54.879 --> 01:42:57.729
coming for his car.  He would 
say I don't know how she does 

01:43:01.399 --> 01:43:03.399
it, does she clip coupons, buy 
everything at a fire sale?

01:43:06.503 --> 01:43:11.620
She dazzled him.  Her love 
transformed his life.  He would 

01:43:11.621 --> 01:43:14.259
say when Cindy goes somewhere 
even for a short while, it is 

01:43:14.260 --> 01:43:20.762
like God has died.
   This is my last story.  I 

01:43:20.763 --> 01:43:22.763
remember one afternoon when 
Denis 

01:43:24.069 --> 01:43:27.328
was giving a talk at the new 
school in New York City.  It was

01:43:27.329 --> 01:43:31.019
a rare appearance, totally sold 
out, standing room only.  It was

01:43:31.020 --> 01:43:33.020
raining, he got there light.  
Someone appeared and rushed him 

01:43:35.930 --> 01:43:37.772
through aside door and up on the
stage and he got separated from 

01:43:37.773 --> 01:43:40.618
Cindy.  Another writer was going
on a bit long 

01:43:44.094 --> 01:43:46.094
with accolades and I noticed 
Denis  looking agitated.

01:43:47.970 --> 01:43:49.999
When he finally got to the Mike,
he put his hand to the forehead 

01:43:50.000 --> 01:43:52.000
and the 

01:43:53.669 --> 01:43:55.669
first thing he said was, Cindy 
Lee, hone, where are you?

01:43:57.745 --> 01:43:59.745
And she raised her arm and 
called back:  I'm here.

01:44:03.650 --> 01:44:05.829
He smiled his incredible boyish 
smile at the sound of your sign 

01:44:05.830 --> 01:44:10.533
and he said I can't see you.  Is
your seat okay?  Where are you? 

01:44:10.534 --> 01:44:15.259
Can you stand up?  She stood up 
and said yes, I'm okay.  I'm 

01:44:15.260 --> 01:44:20.348
here.  And they smiled at each 
other and flirted and he said:  

01:44:20.349 --> 01:44:23.641
All right, then.  And began to 
read his story.

01:44:24.883 --> 01:44:26.883
All right, then.

01:44:29.642 --> 01:44:31.642
It is my great honor to 
introduce my 

01:44:34.901 --> 01:44:36.901
precious fremed, Cindy Lee 
Johnson

01:44:40.298 --> 01:44:43.571
friend, Cindy Lee Johnson.

01:44:44.390 --> 01:44:46.390
(Loud applause.

01:44:47.393 --> 01:44:49.393
)

01:44:53.230 --> 01:44:57.310
   »:  Good evening.  Thank you,
Elizabeth.  Thank you to all the

01:44:57.311 --> 01:45:01.813
panel members.  What a 
wonderfully unusual tribute.  I 

01:45:01.814 --> 01:45:03.814
love it.

01:45:05.468 --> 01:45:07.931
I also want to thank all the 
ladies and gentlemen of the 

01:45:07.932 --> 01:45:09.932
Library of Congress 

01:45:12.002 --> 01:45:14.450
for bee as  ting the esteemed 
prize for American fiction upon 

01:45:14.451 --> 01:45:16.482
my beloved husband.  He so 
richly deserves it.

01:45:19.546 --> 01:45:21.578
When I met Denis he was 39 years
old.  I immediately recognized 

01:45:21.579 --> 01:45:23.874
him as the best looking man in 
the world

01:45:23.875 --> 01:45:26.728
(Laughter.)
   »:  I fell in love 

01:45:26.729 --> 01:45:29.193
straightaway.  Only later did I 
realize he was the 

01:45:32.257 --> 01:45:34.257
best writer in the world, in my 
humble opinion.

01:45:36.335 --> 01:45:39.189
But he was also this brave 
Pilgrim soul who traveled the 

01:45:39.190 --> 01:45:41.190
planet from 

01:45:42.848 --> 01:45:44.848
searching for pirates in the 
Sulu sea to 

01:45:46.951 --> 01:45:49.591
being the last American in 
Somalia when the U.N. withdrew. 

01:45:49.592 --> 01:45:51.592
Consider this from a letter he 
wrote in 1991.

01:45:54.924 --> 01:45:56.555
Dear astronaut selection 
officer, I am a civilian who 

01:45:56.556 --> 01:45:58.556
would like to be 

01:46:00.440 --> 01:46:01.658
considered for the one-year 
astronaut training program.

01:46:01.659 --> 01:46:03.659
That's right!  He tried to go 
into space

01:46:03.714 --> 01:46:07.183
(Laughter.)
   »:  He was like a modern day 

01:46:07.184 --> 01:46:09.184
Tom Sawyer.

01:46:11.862 --> 01:46:14.532
Often he would embark with just 
a fishing vest filled with 

01:46:14.533 --> 01:46:16.959
everything he imagined he might 
need and a face that 

01:46:20.867 --> 01:46:22.110
he would encounter helpers, 
teachers and guides along his 

01:46:22.111 --> 01:46:28.452
path.  And he always did.  His 
life was a grand adventure.  He 

01:46:28.453 --> 01:46:33.165
loved this world.  He loved his 
family.  And he loved his work.

01:46:37.241 --> 01:46:39.478
I am so grateful to have his 
work, his light shines through 

01:46:39.479 --> 01:46:41.479
in his writing.

01:46:43.350 --> 01:46:45.350
And it is a gift to the world.

01:46:47.429 --> 01:46:49.429
But oh, how I miss that man.

01:46:50.503 --> 01:46:52.503
I will always love him.

01:46:54.975 --> 01:46:56.975
And so to close, a slide show.

01:46:58.048 --> 01:46:59.691
I believe it will bare out my 
best looking man in the world 

01:46:59.692 --> 01:47:01.692
comment.

01:47:04.235 --> 01:47:05.858
Also please keep an eye out for 
that fishing vest.  Thank you.

01:47:05.859 --> 01:47:07.859
   (Applause.

01:47:08.880 --> 01:47:10.880
)

01:47:22.141 --> 01:47:24.141
(Playing van Morrison

01:47:26.733 --> 01:47:28.733
"into the mystic

01:47:29.860 --> 01:47:31.860
mystic".)

01:50:29.661 --> 01:50:31.661
   (Applause.

01:50:32.685 --> 01:50:34.685
)

01:50:38.064 --> 01:50:42.567
   »:  Thanks so much, Cindy, 
for helping us end this 

01:50:42.568 --> 01:50:44.619
celebration on such a personal 
and powerful note.

01:50:48.098 --> 01:50:49.522
I'm rob Casper head of the 
Poetry &amp; Literature Center and I

01:50:49.523 --> 01:50:51.969

01:50:56.071 --> 01:50:58.341

Please join me in thanking them
