00:00:00.617 --> 00:00:02.696
Voiceover: I want to use this
video to try to get a better

00:00:02.696 --> 00:00:05.530
intuition for futures curves
and in particular to understand

00:00:05.530 --> 00:00:08.869
that the futures curves
shows a snapshot in time

00:00:08.869 --> 00:00:12.613
of the different market
prices for the, essentially

00:00:12.613 --> 00:00:16.280
the delivery price at different
future dates and when I

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:18.364
say that, I know it was a
kind of confusing statement.

00:00:18.364 --> 00:00:20.614
In this futures curve right over here,

00:00:20.614 --> 00:00:23.363
when you have a delivery date
that's 0 months from now,

00:00:23.363 --> 00:00:26.614
that's essentially today,
that's the market price.

00:00:26.614 --> 00:00:29.735
That is the actual market
price of that commodity.

00:00:29.735 --> 00:00:32.362
In this example, the commodity is silver.

00:00:32.362 --> 00:00:34.614
So if you were to go out
and buy silver today,

00:00:34.614 --> 00:00:38.279
it would cost you roughly
$32, let me say that this is

00:00:38.279 --> 00:00:41.391
per ounce. It would
cost you $32 per ounce.

00:00:41.391 --> 00:00:43.990
When I say one out here, this is one month

00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:47.722
in the future. I'm not
talking about the price.

00:00:47.722 --> 00:00:50.454
I'm not talking about the spot
price of silver in a month.

00:00:50.454 --> 00:00:54.287
I'm talking about the
price today in the market,

00:00:54.287 --> 00:00:58.590
if you were to agree to buy
or sell silver in a month.

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:02.268
The futures price for a
delivery one month out,

00:01:02.268 --> 00:01:03.784
that's what that is right now.

00:01:03.784 --> 00:01:06.117
So I want to make it very
clear. This is not showing you

00:01:06.117 --> 00:01:11.323
how the spot price of silver will
move over the next eight months.

00:01:11.323 --> 00:01:14.691
It's telling you today. If you
wanted to transact in silver

00:01:14.691 --> 00:01:17.515
right now, you would
transact at $32 an ounce.

00:01:17.515 --> 00:01:22.316
If today you agree to transact
in silver a month from now,

00:01:22.316 --> 00:01:23.974
you would transact, you would buy or sell,

00:01:23.974 --> 00:01:26.581
it looks at around $33 an ounce.

00:01:26.581 --> 00:01:30.983
If today you were to agree
to buy or sell silver

00:01:30.983 --> 00:01:35.315
four months from now, you
would do it at $35 an ounce.

00:01:35.315 --> 00:01:37.607
If today, I don't want to
be redundant, but if today

00:01:37.607 --> 00:01:40.917
you were to agree buy or sell
silver eight months from now

00:01:40.917 --> 00:01:43.142
and you were to lock in the
price, you would lock in a

00:01:43.142 --> 00:01:46.557
price, it looks it about I
don't know, $36 an ounce.

00:01:46.557 --> 00:01:49.848
So this is really a snapshot
in time and if for example,

00:01:49.848 --> 00:01:52.325
let's say tomorrow, the price
of silver, there's this huge

00:01:52.325 --> 00:01:55.184
silver shortage or people
realize a new application for

00:01:55.184 --> 00:01:57.871
silver that can change the
world then what you would have

00:01:57.871 --> 00:02:00.582
tomorrow is that this whole
curve would probably shift up.

00:02:00.582 --> 00:02:03.537
The whole curve would shift
up something like that,

00:02:03.537 --> 00:02:05.984
so no matter when you decide
to actually transact in

00:02:05.984 --> 00:02:08.717
the silver, it'll actually get
more expensive but I want to

00:02:08.717 --> 00:02:11.819
make it very clear that this
is just a snapshot in time

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:14.915
and to better understand that,
I've also drawn over here

00:02:14.915 --> 00:02:17.870
how the prices can move it
over time and I've drawn

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:21.650
different durations. So
in purple right over here,

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:24.716
I've drawn the spot price. So
this is the spot price today

00:02:24.716 --> 00:02:27.453
and over here, this is the spot
price today but then I've shown

00:02:27.453 --> 00:02:30.850
how it changes in time. So
this is kind of closer to a

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:34.890
traditional stock chart. This
just tells us that look, the stock

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:38.699
price started at $32 and went
up a little bit, went down

00:02:38.699 --> 00:02:41.057
a little bit. It kind of just
goes up and down, oscillates

00:02:41.057 --> 00:02:44.004
a bit over the next eight
months. So this is actual

00:02:44.004 --> 00:02:47.871
movement over time. This is
a snapshot of delivery dates

00:02:47.871 --> 00:02:51.473
at some point in the future.
So the spot price just moves

00:02:51.473 --> 00:02:54.927
around and let's just take this
green contract right over here.

00:02:54.927 --> 00:02:58.394
So when we start on the first
day, the green contract,

00:02:58.394 --> 00:03:01.662
if you agree to transact in
silver four months from now,

00:03:01.662 --> 00:03:05.527
you're agreeing to transact at about $34.

00:03:05.527 --> 00:03:07.699
So that's where you
would transact right now,

00:03:07.699 --> 00:03:11.547
that four month out contract,
but as you move few -

00:03:11.547 --> 00:03:13.514
as you move more and more forward in time,

00:03:13.514 --> 00:03:16.139
you're getting closer and
closer to that delivery date.

00:03:16.139 --> 00:03:18.057
If you move one month into the future,

00:03:18.057 --> 00:03:20.390
now that contract is only
going to be three months out.

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:21.514
You move two months in the future,

00:03:21.514 --> 00:03:23.514
now that contract is only two months out.

00:03:23.514 --> 00:03:26.056
All the way until, if
you move four months out,

00:03:26.056 --> 00:03:30.390
this contract will now be
essentially the spot price

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:33.460
because you're now
agreeing to transact now.

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:35.249
That'll happen four months
from now, but you'll now

00:03:35.249 --> 00:03:37.933
be agreeing to transact at that
moment and so at that moment,

00:03:37.933 --> 00:03:40.415
that price should be the
same as the spot price,

00:03:40.415 --> 00:03:43.200
so you'll have this
convergent with the spot price

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:44.985
and the same thing for the
eight month out contract,

00:03:44.985 --> 00:03:49.789
it should converge over
the next eight months.
