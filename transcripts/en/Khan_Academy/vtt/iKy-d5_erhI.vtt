00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.333
- So let's keep thinking
about different ways

00:00:02.333 --> 00:00:05.800
to sit multiple people in
the certain number of chairs.

00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:07.033
So let's say we have six people.

00:00:07.033 --> 00:00:11.367
We have person A, we have
person B, we have person C,

00:00:11.367 --> 00:00:15.600
person D, person E, and we have person F.

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:17.133
So we have six people.

00:00:17.133 --> 00:00:19.666
And for the sake of this
video, we're going to say

00:00:19.666 --> 00:00:21.300
oh we want to figure
out all the scenarios,

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:23.333
all the possibilities,
all the permutations,

00:00:23.333 --> 00:00:25.966
all the ways that we could
put them into three chairs.

00:00:25.966 --> 00:00:28.667
So there's chair number
one, chair number two

00:00:28.667 --> 00:00:29.933
and chair number three.

00:00:29.933 --> 00:00:30.666
This is all review.

00:00:30.666 --> 00:00:32.933
This is covered in the permutations video.

00:00:32.933 --> 00:00:34.466
But it'll be very instructive as we move

00:00:34.466 --> 00:00:36.666
into a new concept.

00:00:36.666 --> 00:00:38.466
So what are all the
permutations of putting

00:00:38.466 --> 00:00:41.300
six different people into three chairs?

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:42.766
Well, like we've seen before,

00:00:42.766 --> 00:00:44.367
we can start with the first chair.

00:00:44.367 --> 00:00:45.700
And we can say look if no one's sat--

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:49.133
If we haven't seated anyone yet,

00:00:49.133 --> 00:00:52.033
how many different people could
we put in chair number one?

00:00:52.033 --> 00:00:53.767
Well there's six different
people who could be

00:00:53.767 --> 00:00:55.966
in chair number one.

00:00:55.966 --> 00:00:57.933
Let me get a different color.

00:00:57.933 --> 00:01:00.500
There are six people who
could be in chair number one.

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:04.133
Six different scenarios for
who sits in chair number one.

00:01:04.133 --> 00:01:06.800
Now for each of those six scenarios,

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:08.566
how many people, how many different people

00:01:08.566 --> 00:01:10.500
could sit in chair number two?

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.266
Well each of those six
scenarios we've taken

00:01:12.266 --> 00:01:14.900
one of the six people to
sit in chair number one.

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:17.166
So that means you have
five out of the six people

00:01:17.166 --> 00:01:19.700
left to sit in chair number two.

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:21.200
Or another way to think about it is

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:23.899
there's six scenarios of
someone in chair number one

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:25.933
and for each of those six,
you have five scenarios

00:01:25.933 --> 00:01:27.600
for who's in chair number two.

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.833
So you have a total of 30 scenarios

00:01:29.833 --> 00:01:34.433
where you have seated six
people in the first two chairs.

00:01:34.433 --> 00:01:35.933
And now if you want to say

00:01:35.933 --> 00:01:37.700
well what about for the three chairs?

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:39.600
Well for each of these 30 scenarios,

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.400
how many different people could you put

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.766
in chair number three?

00:01:43.766 --> 00:01:45.233
Well you're still going
to have four people

00:01:45.233 --> 00:01:46.766
standing up not in chairs.

00:01:46.766 --> 00:01:49.133
So for each of these 30 scenarios,

00:01:49.133 --> 00:01:51.333
you have four people who you could put

00:01:51.333 --> 00:01:52.800
in chair number three.

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:54.600
So your total number of scenarios,

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.666
or your total number of permutations

00:01:56.666 --> 00:01:58.800
where we care who's sitting in which chair

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:01.733
is six times five times four,

00:02:01.733 --> 00:02:06.733
which is equal to 120 permutations.

00:02:06.733 --> 00:02:09.300
Permutations.

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:11.166
Now lemme, permutations.

00:02:11.166 --> 00:02:12.300
Now it's worth thinking about

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:14.167
what permutations are counting.

00:02:14.167 --> 00:02:15.633
Now remember we care,
when we're talking about

00:02:15.633 --> 00:02:18.033
permutations, we care about who's sitting

00:02:18.033 --> 00:02:18.966
in which chair.

00:02:18.966 --> 00:02:23.466
So for example, for example
this is one permutation.

00:02:23.466 --> 00:02:26.833
And this would be counted
as another permutation.

00:02:26.833 --> 00:02:30.967
And this would be counted
as another permutation.

00:02:30.967 --> 00:02:33.100
This would be counted
as another permutation.

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:35.033
So notice these are all
the same three people,

00:02:35.033 --> 00:02:36.566
but we're putting them
in different chairs.

00:02:36.566 --> 00:02:37.500
And this counted that.

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:38.633
That's counted in this 120.

00:02:38.633 --> 00:02:39.966
I could keep going.

00:02:39.966 --> 00:02:43.133
We could have that, or we could have that.

00:02:43.133 --> 00:02:44.800
So our thinking in the permutation world.

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:46.533
We would count all of these.

00:02:46.533 --> 00:02:49.733
Or we would count this as
six different permutations.

00:02:49.733 --> 00:02:52.000
These are going towards this 120.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:53.400
And of course we have other permutations

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:54.766
where we would involve other people.

00:02:54.766 --> 00:02:59.766
Where we have, it could
be F, B, C, F, C, B,

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:05.300
F, A, C, F, F.

00:03:05.367 --> 00:03:06.566
Actually let me do it this way.

00:03:06.566 --> 00:03:08.166
I'm going to be a little
bit more systematic.

00:03:08.166 --> 00:03:10.433
F, uh lemme do it.

00:03:10.433 --> 00:03:15.433
B, B, F, C, B, C, F.

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:17.000
And obviously I could keep doing.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:18.200
I can do 120 of these.

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:19.466
I'll do two more.

00:03:19.466 --> 00:03:22.966
You could have C, F, B.

00:03:22.966 --> 00:03:25.833
And then you could have C, B, F.

00:03:25.833 --> 00:03:28.234
So in the permutation world, these are,

00:03:28.234 --> 00:03:31.633
these are literally 12
of the 120 permutations.

00:03:31.633 --> 00:03:33.933
But what if we, what if all we cared about

00:03:33.933 --> 00:03:36.033
is the three people we're choosing

00:03:36.033 --> 00:03:38.066
to sit down, but we don't care

00:03:38.066 --> 00:03:40.034
in what order that they're sitting,

00:03:40.034 --> 00:03:41.567
or in which chair they're sitting.

00:03:41.567 --> 00:03:45.133
So in that world, these would all be one.

00:03:45.133 --> 00:03:47.966
This is all the same set of three people

00:03:47.966 --> 00:03:50.933
if we don't care which
chair they're sitting in.

00:03:50.933 --> 00:03:54.400
This would also be the
same set of three people.

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:56.000
And so this question.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.000
If I have six people
sitting in three chairs,

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.266
how many ways can I choose
three people out of the six

00:04:02.266 --> 00:04:04.300
where I don't care
which chair they sit on?

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:05.933
And I encourage you to pause the video,

00:04:05.933 --> 00:04:09.966
and try to think of what that
number would actually be.

00:04:09.966 --> 00:04:12.700
Well a big clue was when we essentially

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:15.000
wrote all of the permutations
where we've picked

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:16.200
a group of three people.

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:19.566
We see that there's six ways
of arranging the three people.

00:04:19.566 --> 00:04:21.500
When you pick a certain
group of three people,

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:23.766
that turned into six permutations.

00:04:23.766 --> 00:04:25.933
And so if all you want to do is care about

00:04:25.933 --> 00:04:27.866
well how many different
ways are there to choose

00:04:27.866 --> 00:04:30.100
three from the six?

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:32.200
You would take your whole permutations.

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:34.800
You would take your
number of permutations.

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:37.133
You would take your
number of permutations.

00:04:37.133 --> 00:04:39.533
And then you would divide
it by the number of ways

00:04:39.533 --> 00:04:41.933
to arrange three people.

00:04:41.933 --> 00:04:46.933
Number of ways to arrange,
arrange three people.

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:54.100
And we see that you can
arrange three people,

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:55.466
or even three letters.

00:04:55.466 --> 00:04:57.633
You can arrange it in six different ways.

00:04:57.633 --> 00:05:02.300
So this would be equal
to 120 divided by six,

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:05.166
or this would be equal to 20.

00:05:05.166 --> 00:05:07.567
So there are 120 permutations here.

00:05:07.567 --> 00:05:09.767
If you said how many different
arrangements are there

00:05:09.767 --> 00:05:12.567
of taking six people and
putting them into three chairs?

00:05:12.567 --> 00:05:13.966
That's 120.

00:05:13.966 --> 00:05:15.466
But now we're asking another thing.

00:05:15.466 --> 00:05:19.100
We're saying if we start with 120 people,

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:21.533
and we want to choose.

00:05:21.533 --> 00:05:25.734
Sorry if we're starting with six people

00:05:25.734 --> 00:05:27.533
and we want to figure out how many ways,

00:05:27.533 --> 00:05:29.967
how many combinations,
how many ways are there

00:05:29.967 --> 00:05:32.800
for us to choose three of them?

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:36.866
Then we end up with 20 combinations.

00:05:36.866 --> 00:05:39.733
Combinations of people.

00:05:39.733 --> 00:05:41.800
This right over here, once again,

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:43.600
this right over here is
just one combination.

00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:46.167
It's the combination, A, B, C.

00:05:46.167 --> 00:05:47.833
I don't care what order they sit in.

00:05:47.833 --> 00:05:49.033
I have chosen them.

00:05:49.033 --> 00:05:50.933
I have chosen these three of the six.

00:05:50.933 --> 00:05:52.566
This is a combination of people.

00:05:52.566 --> 00:05:54.166
I don't care about the order.

00:05:54.166 --> 00:05:55.600
This right over here
is another combination.

00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:57.966
It is F, C, and B.

00:05:57.966 --> 00:05:59.667
Once again I don't care about the order.

00:05:59.667 --> 00:06:02.067
I just care that I've
chosen these three people.

00:06:02.067 --> 00:06:03.933
So how many ways are there to choose

00:06:03.933 --> 00:06:05.733
three people out of six?

00:06:05.733 --> 00:06:07.300
It is 20.

00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:08.933
It's the total number of permutations.

00:06:08.933 --> 00:06:11.900
It's 120 divided by the number of ways

00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:15.133
you can arrange three people.
