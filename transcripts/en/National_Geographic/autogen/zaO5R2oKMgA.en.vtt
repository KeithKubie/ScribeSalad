taking the ship out of the water which

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070
taking the ship out of the water which
 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:24.500
taking the ship out of the water which
is a real challenge and normally put

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:24.510
is a real challenge and normally put
 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:25.939
is a real challenge and normally put
that ship and drydock to do this work

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949
that ship and drydock to do this work
 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:27.859
that ship and drydock to do this work
but the ship's full of iron ore on its

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869
but the ship's full of iron ore on its
 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:28.970
but the ship's full of iron ore on its
way to China it's worth a lot of money

putting in the chain falls and trying to

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280
putting in the chain falls and trying to
 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:47.450
putting in the chain falls and trying to
slowly lower it out but I ran into a lot

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460
slowly lower it out but I ran into a lot
 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:49.430

we got down there we're trying to use
 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:58.819
we got down there we're trying to use

ultimately we had to bring in a diamond

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770
ultimately we had to bring in a diamond
 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:09.630
ultimately we had to bring in a diamond
wire saw and cut the whole thing off

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:09.640
wire saw and cut the whole thing off
 

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:12.030
wire saw and cut the whole thing off
I want to give away too much of the

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:12.040
I want to give away too much of the
 

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:14.190
I want to give away too much of the
story but we do eventually persevere but

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:14.200
story but we do eventually persevere but
 

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:16.860
story but we do eventually persevere but
just suffice it to say there's there's a

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:16.870
just suffice it to say there's there's a
 

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:19.620
just suffice it to say there's there's a
lot of water
