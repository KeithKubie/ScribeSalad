00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
Have you ever noticed that it's harder 
to start pedaling your bicycle

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
than it is to ride at a constant speed?

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
Or wondered what causes your bicycle to move?

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.246
Or thought about why it goes forward 
instead of backwards or sideways?

00:00:27.246 --> 00:00:30.259
Perhaps not, and you wouldn't be alone.

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:31.815
It wasn't until the 17th century

00:00:31.815 --> 00:00:34.692
that Isaac Newton described 
the fundamental laws of motion

00:00:34.692 --> 00:00:37.000
and we understood the answer 
to these three questions.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.800
What Newton recognized was that 
things tend to keep on doing

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.692
what they are already doing. 
So when your bicycle is stopped,

00:00:43.692 --> 00:00:46.692
it stays stopped, and when it is going,

00:00:46.692 --> 00:00:48.000
it stays going.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
Objects in motion tend to stay in motion

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.815
and objects at rest tend to stay at rest.

00:00:53.815 --> 00:00:55.891
That's Newton's First Law.

00:00:55.891 --> 00:00:59.523
Physicists call it the Law of Inertia, 
which is a fancy way of saying

00:00:59.523 --> 00:01:03.984
that moving objects don't spontaneously 
speed up, slow down, or change direction.

00:01:03.984 --> 00:01:09.000
It is this inertia that you must overcome 
to get your bicycle moving.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
Now you know that you have to overcome 
inertia to get your bicycle moving,

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
but what is it that allows you to overcome it?

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.076
Well, the answer is explained by Newton's Second Law.

00:01:18.076 --> 00:01:20.538
In mathematical terms, Newton's Second Law says

00:01:20.538 --> 00:01:24.000
that force is the product of mass times acceleration.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
To cause an object to accelerate, or speed up,

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
a force must be applied.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
The more force you apply,

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000
the quicker you accelerate. 
And the more mass your bicycle has,

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
and the more mass you have too,

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.830
the more force you have to use 
to accelerate at the same rate.

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:43.646
This is why it would be really difficult 
to pedal a 10,000 pound bicycle.

00:01:43.646 --> 00:01:49.060
And it is this force, which is applied 
by your legs pushing down on the pedals,

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:52.092
that allows you to overcome Newton's Law of Inertia.

00:01:52.092 --> 00:01:54.969
The harder you push down on the pedals, 
the bigger the force

00:01:54.969 --> 00:01:56.569
and the quicker you accelerate.

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:58.784
Now on to the final question:

00:01:58.784 --> 00:02:00.661
When you do get your bike moving,

00:02:00.661 --> 00:02:03.000
why does it go forward?

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000
According to Newton's Third Law, 
for every action,

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.861
there is an equal and opposite reaction.

00:02:07.861 --> 00:02:12.292
To understand this, think about what 
happens when you drop a bouncy ball.

00:02:12.292 --> 00:02:13.953
As the bouncy ball hits the floor,

00:02:13.953 --> 00:02:15.815
it causes a downward force on the floor.

00:02:15.815 --> 00:02:17.876
This is the action.

00:02:17.876 --> 00:02:21.000
The floor reacts by pushing 
on the ball with the same force,

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000
but in the opposite direction, upward,

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000
causing it to bounce back up to you.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000
Together, the floor and the ball form what's called

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.000
the action/reaction pair. 
When it comes to your bicycle,

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.569
it is a little more complicated. 
As your bicycle wheels spin

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:39.000
clockwise, the parts of each tire 
touching the ground

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000
push backwards against the Earth:

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.000
the actions. The ground pushes 
forward with the same force

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.261
against each of your tires: the reactions.

00:02:49.261 --> 00:02:53.000
Since you have two bicycle tires, 
each one forms an action/reaction pair

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.553
with the ground. And since 
the Earth is really, really, really big

00:02:56.553 --> 00:02:59.000
compared to your bicycle, it barely moves

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.000
from the force caused by your bicycle 
tires pushing backwards,

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:11.795
but you are propelled forward.
