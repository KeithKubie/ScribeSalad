00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.535
3- 4 times the quantity
of x + 5 gives -4x -17.

00:00:07.535 --> 00:00:15.020
Let's first rewrite this
as 3 + (-4)(x + 5).

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:19.938
Now we have to distribute this -4 to
both terms inside the parentheses.

00:00:19.938 --> 00:00:27.320
And we get 3 + ((-4)x + (-4)5).

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:32.374
This becomes 3 + (-4x + (-20)),

00:00:32.374 --> 00:00:37.964
which is the same thing
as 3 + (-4x- 20).

00:00:37.964 --> 00:00:41.370
We can't combine terms, and
there's nothing to distribute.

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:48.946
So we can take away
the parentheses to get 3- 4x- 20.

00:00:48.946 --> 00:00:52.560
We can combine our like terms of 20 and
3.

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:57.972
Which gives us -17 and
then -4x stays how it is,

00:00:57.972 --> 00:01:02.164
and that's our answer, -4x- 17.
