00:00:00.269 --> 00:00:04.380
Look, I don’t have to be drunk to eat an
entire five-dollar pizza by myself.

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:10.129
But it does help!

00:00:10.129 --> 00:00:13.360
Hey there inebriated epicureans, Jules here
for DNews!

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:16.590
If you’re an alcohol-drinking adult, then
there’s a good chance you’ve found yourself

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:21.340
shoving greasy, unpalatable food in your mouth
at 2:30 in the AM for reasons that don’t

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:22.670
seem too clear the next morning.

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:26.910
It’s more than an anecdotal tale; people
tend to eat a lot more food when they’re

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:27.910
drunk.

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:31.480
A review article of multiple studies on the
effects of alcohol on appetite, published

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:36.030
in the journal Current Opinion in Clinical
Nutrition and Metabolic Care, found that quote,

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:39.890
“moderate alcohol consumption… leads to
a short-term increase in food intake”.

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:43.790
Now, what’s puzzling is that alcohol is
really calorically dense.

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:47.920
A gram of pure alcohol contains more calories
than a gram of carbohydrates, or protein,

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:49.850
and almost as many as in a gram of fat.

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:54.059
Of course, you wouldn’t want to drink pure
alcohol, but even a typical beer has two-thirds

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:57.340
as many calories as a small order of McDonald’s
french fries.!

00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:01.790
It doesn’t make sense for your body to down
multiple beers, multiple orders of “liquid

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:04.199
fries,” and then literally, want more fries!

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:08.729
Well, as it turns out, it may have less to
do with caloric content, and more to do…

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:09.729
with your brain.

00:01:09.729 --> 00:01:15.060
In a study published in 2017 in Nature Communications,
scientists found that mice ate considerably

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:18.720
more after they were injected with alcohol
for three straight days — what they called

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:20.079
an “alcohol weekend”.

00:01:20.079 --> 00:01:24.259
Then, they exposed slices of mouse brains
to alcohol and found that certain neurons

00:01:24.259 --> 00:01:25.689
fired more often.

00:01:25.689 --> 00:01:29.509
These particular neurons released a peptide
— a small chain of amino acids — called

00:01:29.509 --> 00:01:30.619
AgRP.

00:01:30.619 --> 00:01:33.679
AgRP tells your brain that you are hungry.

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:37.420
So, alcohol makes you want to eat regardless
of whether you’re packed full of calories

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:38.420
already.

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:42.329
Basically, your brain is telling you, “Hey,
I’m STARVING”, even if you totally aren’t.

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:43.810
What’s even crazier?

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:46.700
You might not even feel full after you satisfy
those cravings.

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:51.630
A 2001 study of 7 men and 7 women in the journal
Clinical Endocrinology, found that alcohol

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:54.850
consumption lowered production of a hormone
called leptin.

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:57.909
Leptin is the reason you feel full and satisfied
after a meal.

00:01:57.909 --> 00:02:01.509
Without it, you never quite hit that sweet
full feeling that you’re going for.

00:02:01.509 --> 00:02:05.319
The study posited that alcohol could directly
suppress this hormone.

00:02:05.319 --> 00:02:08.160
But that is just one part of a complicated
equation.

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:11.720
It turns out that when you’re drunk, you
also tend to eat food that you might not normally

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:12.720
find appetizing.

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:13.720
That’s why you might down eleven street
tacos full of questionable meats.

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:16.250
The reason for this is believed to involve
your opiate system.

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:20.780
See, one of the reasons alcohol reduces pain,
makes you feel good, and is addictive, is

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:24.920
that it has a strong effect on your opiate
system, which is directly involved in pain,

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:26.200
reward, and addiction.

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:29.970
In particular, alcohol increases the presence
of endogenous opioids.

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:34.720
Now, these opioids are believed to be related
to how your brain processes food, and in particular

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:37.550
its texture, taste, and overall palatability.

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:41.660
A study in the European Journal of Neuroscience
found that in rats, these opioids increase

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:43.790
the desire eat more sugary foods.

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:48.830
So, if you normally avoid street tacos, you
may not be so averse when you’re drunk.

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:52.630
So in the end, being drunk means that you
feel hungrier, don’t end up feeling full,

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:53.680
and eat grosser food.

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:57.210
And that’s just one small part of the whole
“drunk” experience.

00:02:57.210 --> 00:03:00.440
Alcohol has a complex relationship with the
body, and many people certainly feel those

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:02.790
effects the next day in the form of a hangover.

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:07.590
Ironically, eating BEFORE you get drunk is
a good way to avoid a hangover, so… just

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:09.280
try not to eat or drink too much.

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:10.600
Your body will thank you.

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:13.080
So now that you’re hungover, what do you
do!?

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:16.740
You can find out some cures science has cooked
up in this episode right here.

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:18.190
And do have any more questions about drinking?

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:20.300
Well, I’ve got plenty of experience.

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:21.310
Answering questions.
