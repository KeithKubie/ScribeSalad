00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:03.540
Let's say you're some type of
traffic engineer and what

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:06.810
you're trying to figure out is,
how many cars pass by a certain

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:08.320
point on the street at
any given point in time?

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:10.210
And you want to figure out
the probabilities that a

00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:14.010
hundred cars pass or 5
cars pass in a given hour.

00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:15.810
So a good place to start is
just to define a random

00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:20.530
variable that essentially
represents what you care about.

00:00:20.530 --> 00:00:27.350
So let's say the number of cars
that pass in some amount of

00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:28.730
time, let's say, in an hour.

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:34.510
And your goal is to figure out
the probability distribution of

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:37.050
this random variable and then
once you know the probability

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:39.450
distribution then you can
figure out what's the

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:41.790
probability that 100 cars pass
in an hour or the probability

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:45.890
that no cars pass in an hour
and you'd be unstoppable.

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:48.290
And just a little aside, just
to move forward with this

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:50.540
video, there's two assumptions
we need to make because

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:52.235
we're going to study the
Poisson distribution.

00:00:52.235 --> 00:00:54.110
And in order to study it's
there's two assumptions

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.630
we have to make.

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:58.770
That Poisson hour at this point
on the street is no different

00:00:58.770 --> 00:00:59.650
than any other hour.

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:01.340
And we know that that's
probably false.

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:03.750
During rush hour in a real
situation you probably

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:06.640
would have more cars than
at another rush hour.

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:08.640
And you know, if you wanted to
be more realistic maybe we do

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:12.370
it in the day because in a day
any period of time--

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:12.750
actually, no.

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:14.120
I shouldn't do a day.

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:17.750
We have to assume that every
hour is completely just like

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:19.650
any other hour and actually,
even within the hour there's

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:22.990
really no differentiation from
one second to the other in

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:25.820
terms of the probabilities
that a car arrives.

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:27.950
That's a little bit of a
simplifying assumption that

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:29.950
might not truly apply to
traffic, but I think we

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:32.270
can make that assumption.

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:34.160
And then the other assumption
we need to make is that if a

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:36.690
bunch of cars pass in one hour
that doesn't mean that fewer

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:37.820
cars will pass in the next.

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:40.630
That in no way does the number
of cars that pass in one period

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:44.860
affect or correlate or somehow
influence the number of cars

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:45.380
that pass in the next.

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:47.370
That they're really
independent.

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:50.670
Given that, we can then at
least try using the skills

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:53.480
we have to model out some
type of a distribution.

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:55.770
The first thing you do and I'd
recommend doing this for any

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:59.090
distribution is maybe we
can estimate the mean.

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:03.040
Let's sit out on that curb and
measure what this variable is

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:05.170
over a bunch of hours and then
average it up, and that's going

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:08.890
to be a pretty good estimator
for the actual mean

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:09.880
of our population.

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:12.270
Or, since it's a random
variable, the expected value

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:13.010
of this random variable.

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:16.660
Let's say you do that and you
get your best estimate of the

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:22.270
expected value of this random
variable is-- I'll use

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:24.850
the letter lambda.

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:27.380
You know, this could
be 9 cars per hour.

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:30.190
You sat out there-- it could
be 9.3 cars per hour.

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:32.670
You sat out there over hundreds
of hours and you just counted

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:34.590
the number of cars each hour
and you averaged them all up.

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:37.250
You said, on average, there are
9.3 cars per hour and you feel

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:38.680
that's a pretty good estimate.

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:40.080
So that's what you have there.

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:42.000
And let's see what we could do.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.560
We know the binomial
distribution.

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:50.650
The binomial distribution tells
us that the expected value of a

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:55.220
random variable is equal to the
number of trials that that

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:57.460
random variable's kind
of composed of, right?

00:02:57.460 --> 00:02:59.490
Before, in the previous videos
we were counting the number

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:00.500
of heads in a coin toss.

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:03.070
So this would be the number
of coin tosses, times the

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:07.290
probability of success
over each toss.

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:09.000
This is what we did with
the binomial distribution.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.670
So maybe we can model
our traffic situation

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:12.780
something similar.

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:15.400
This is the number of cars
that pass in an hour.

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:22.800
So maybe we could say lambda
cars per hour is equal

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:24.330
to-- I don't know.

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:29.880
Let's make each experiment or
each toss of the coin equal to

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:31.780
whether a car passes
in a given minute.

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:37.980
So there are 60 minutes
per hour, so there

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:40.870
would be 60 trials.

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:43.190
And then, the probability that
we have success in each of

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:46.990
those trials, if we modeled
this as a binomial distribution

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:54.450
would be lambda over
60 cars per minute.

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:55.660
And this would be
a probability.

00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:58.640
This would be n, and this would
be the probability, if we said

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:00.270
that this is a binomial
distribution.

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:04.030
And this probably wouldn't be
that bad of an approximation.

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:06.130
If you actually then said,
oh, this is a binomial

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:10.380
distribution, so the
probability that our random

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:12.940
variable equals some
given value, k.

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:16.170
You know, the probability that
3 cars, exactly 3 cars pass in

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:19.750
an given hour, we would
then be equal to n.

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:21.890
So n would be 60.

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:26.010
Choose k, and you know,
I have 3 cars times the

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:27.190
probability of success.

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:29.570
So the probability that a
car passes in any minute.

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:34.770
So it'd be lambda over
60 to the number of

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:35.980
successes we need.

00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:41.660
So to the kth power, times the
probability of no success or

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:46.560
that no cars pass,
to the n minus k.

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:50.230
If we have k successes we have
to have 60 minus k failures.

00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:52.950
There are 60 minus k minutes
where no car passed.

00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:55.270
This actually wouldn't be that
bad of an approximation where

00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:57.250
you have 60 intervals and you
say this is a binomial

00:04:57.250 --> 00:04:58.560
distribution.

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:00.310
And you'd probably get
reasonable results.

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:02.600
But there's a core issue here.

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:06.580
In this model where we model it
as a binomial distribution,

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:09.980
what happens if more than
one car passes in an hour?

00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:11.630
Or more than one car
passes in a minute?

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:14.270
The way we have it right now
we call it a success if one

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:15.320
car passes in a minute.

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:18.790
And if you're kind of counting
it counts as one success, even

00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:21.190
if 5 cars pass in that minute.

00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:23.390
So you say, oh, OK Sal, I
know the solution there.

00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:26.040
I just have to get
more granular.

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:28.870
Instead of dividing it
into minutes why don't I

00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:31.050
divide it into seconds?

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:36.210
So the probability that I have
k successes-- instead of 60

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:39.820
intervals I'll do
3,600 intervals.

00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:43.170
So the probability of k
successful seconds, so a second

00:05:43.170 --> 00:05:48.610
where a car is passing at that
moment out of 3,600 seconds.

00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:52.190
So that's 3,600 choose k, times
the probability that a car

00:05:52.190 --> 00:05:55.210
passes in any given second.

00:05:55.210 --> 00:05:57.930
That's the expected number of
cars in an hour divided by

00:05:57.930 --> 00:06:00.430
number seconds in an hour.

00:06:00.430 --> 00:06:01.403
We're going to
have k successes.

00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:06.270
And these are the failures,
the probability of a failure

00:06:06.270 --> 00:06:12.050
and you're going to have
3,600 minus k failures.

00:06:12.050 --> 00:06:13.910
And this would be even a
better approximation.

00:06:13.910 --> 00:06:16.770
This actually would not be so
bad, but still, you have this

00:06:16.770 --> 00:06:19.100
situation where 2 cars
can come within a half a

00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:19.980
second of each other.

00:06:19.980 --> 00:06:21.910
And you say, oh, OK Sal,
I see the pattern here.

00:06:21.910 --> 00:06:23.650
We just have to get more
and more granular.

00:06:23.650 --> 00:06:26.170
We have to just make
this number larger and

00:06:26.170 --> 00:06:27.400
larger and larger.

00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:28.950
And your intuition is correct.

00:06:28.950 --> 00:06:31.340
And if you do that you'll
end up getting the

00:06:31.340 --> 00:06:33.860
Poisson distribution.

00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:35.620
And this is really interesting
because a lot of times people

00:06:35.620 --> 00:06:38.600
give you the formula for the
Poisson distribution and you

00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:40.420
can kind of just plug in
the numbers and use it.

00:06:40.420 --> 00:06:43.250
But it's neat to know that it
really is just the binomial

00:06:43.250 --> 00:06:45.790
distribution and the binomial
distribution really did come

00:06:45.790 --> 00:06:48.590
from kind of the common
sense of flipping coins.

00:06:48.590 --> 00:06:50.500
That's where everything
is coming from.

00:06:50.500 --> 00:06:53.710
But before we kind of prove
that if we take the limit

00:06:53.710 --> 00:06:55.670
as-- let me change colors.

00:06:55.670 --> 00:06:58.470
Before we proved that as we
take the limit as this number

00:06:58.470 --> 00:07:01.270
right here, the number of
intervals approaches infinity

00:07:01.270 --> 00:07:04.070
that this becomes the
Poisson distribution.

00:07:04.070 --> 00:07:07.290
I'm going to make sure we have
a couple of mathematical

00:07:07.290 --> 00:07:09.150
tools in our belt.

00:07:09.150 --> 00:07:12.760
So the first is something that
you're probably reasonably

00:07:12.760 --> 00:07:15.860
familiar with by now, but I
just want to make sure that the

00:07:15.860 --> 00:07:25.680
limit as x approaches infinity
of 1 plus a/x to the x power is

00:07:25.680 --> 00:07:31.020
equal to e to the
ax-- no sorry.

00:07:31.020 --> 00:07:38.020
Is equal to e to the a and now
just to prove this to you,

00:07:38.020 --> 00:07:39.260
let's make a little
substitution here.

00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:43.640
Let's say that n is equal
to-- let me say 1 over

00:07:43.640 --> 00:07:47.880
n is equal to a over x.

00:07:47.880 --> 00:07:52.890
And then what would be
x would equal to na.

00:07:52.890 --> 00:07:55.290
x times 1 is equal
to n times a.

00:07:55.290 --> 00:08:00.050
And so the limit as x
approaches infinity,

00:08:00.050 --> 00:08:02.045
what does a approach?

00:08:02.045 --> 00:08:02.885
a is-- sorry.

00:08:02.885 --> 00:08:04.920
As x approaches infinity
what does n approach?

00:08:04.920 --> 00:08:07.350
Well n is x divided by a.

00:08:07.350 --> 00:08:08.710
So n would also
approach infinity.

00:08:08.710 --> 00:08:10.810
So this thing would be the same
thing as just making our

00:08:10.810 --> 00:08:16.460
substitution the limit as n
approaches infinity of 1

00:08:16.460 --> 00:08:21.390
plus-- a/x, I made the
substitution as 1/n.

00:08:21.390 --> 00:08:26.720
And x is, by this
substitution, n times a.

00:08:26.720 --> 00:08:30.500
And this is going to be the
same thing as the limit as n

00:08:30.500 --> 00:08:36.090
approaches infinity of 1 plus
1/n to the n, all

00:08:36.090 --> 00:08:39.390
of that to the a.

00:08:39.390 --> 00:08:41.760
And since there's no n out here
we could just take the limit

00:08:41.760 --> 00:08:43.450
of this and then take
that to the a power.

00:08:43.450 --> 00:08:47.690
So that's going to be equal to
the limit as n approaches

00:08:47.690 --> 00:08:52.600
infinity of 1 plus 1/n to the
nth power, all of

00:08:52.600 --> 00:08:53.780
that to the a.

00:08:53.780 --> 00:08:58.040
And this is our definition, or
one of the ways to get to e if

00:08:58.040 --> 00:09:00.820
you'd watch the videos on
compound interest and all that.

00:09:00.820 --> 00:09:01.880
This is how we got to e.

00:09:01.880 --> 00:09:03.460
And if you tried it out on your
calculator, just try larger

00:09:03.460 --> 00:09:07.260
and larger n's here
and you'll get e.

00:09:07.260 --> 00:09:12.010
This inner part is equal to e,
and we raised it to the a

00:09:12.010 --> 00:09:14.060
power, so it's equal
to e to the a.

00:09:14.060 --> 00:09:16.240
So hopefully you pretty
satisfied that this limit

00:09:16.240 --> 00:09:17.860
is equal to e to the a.

00:09:17.860 --> 00:09:19.860
And then one other tool kit I
want in our belt, and I'll

00:09:19.860 --> 00:09:22.340
probably actually do the
proof in the next video.

00:09:22.340 --> 00:09:32.950
The other tool kit is to
recognize that x factorial over

00:09:32.950 --> 00:09:42.860
x minus k factorial is equal to
x times x minus 1 times x

00:09:42.860 --> 00:09:50.030
minus 2, all the way down
to times x minus k plus 1.

00:09:50.030 --> 00:09:51.880
And we've done this a lot of
times, but this is the most

00:09:51.880 --> 00:09:53.060
abstract we've ever written it.

00:09:53.060 --> 00:09:55.580
I can give you a couple of--
and just so you know, they'll

00:09:55.580 --> 00:09:57.330
be exactly k terms here.

00:09:57.330 --> 00:10:01.700
1, 2, 3-- So first term, second
term, third term, all the

00:10:01.700 --> 00:10:04.310
way, and this the kth term.

00:10:04.310 --> 00:10:07.210
And this is important to
our derivation of the

00:10:07.210 --> 00:10:09.160
Poisson distribution.

00:10:09.160 --> 00:10:13.870
But just to make this in real
numbers, if I had 7 factorial

00:10:13.870 --> 00:10:20.110
over 7 minus 2 factorial,
that's equal to 7 times 6

00:10:20.110 --> 00:10:24.070
times 5 times 4 times
3 times 3 times 1.

00:10:24.070 --> 00:10:27.360
Over 2 times-- no sorry.

00:10:27.360 --> 00:10:28.940
7 minus 2, this is 5.

00:10:28.940 --> 00:10:33.500
So it's over 5 times 4
times 3 times 2 times 1.

00:10:33.500 --> 00:10:37.190
These cancel out and you
just have 7 times 6.

00:10:37.190 --> 00:10:40.990
And so it's 7 and then
the last term is 7 minus

00:10:40.990 --> 00:10:43.045
2 plus 1, which is 6.

00:10:47.560 --> 00:10:51.290
In this example, k was 2 and
you had exactly 2 terms.

00:10:51.290 --> 00:10:53.230
So once we know those two
things we're now ready

00:10:53.230 --> 00:10:55.710
to derive the Poisson
distribution and I'll do

00:10:55.710 --> 00:10:58.415
that in the next video.

00:10:58.415 --> 00:10:59.980
See you soon.
