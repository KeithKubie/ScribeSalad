00:00:02.230 --> 00:00:05.990
I'm Wayne Pacelle, and I've
been privileged to serve

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:09.900
as president and CEO of the
Humane Society of the United

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:12.030
States, headquartered
in Washington, DC,

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:14.050
for the last 11 years.

00:00:14.050 --> 00:00:15.920
And I've been with
the organization

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:17.390
for the last 21 years.

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:20.510
I used to be the chief political
and communications person.

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:23.640
And my colleague,
Josh Balk is here.

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:28.270
He helps run our Farm Animal
Protection Department.

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:32.374
And he also has created
a company in this area,

00:00:32.374 --> 00:00:34.360
a food company
called Hampton Creek,

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:39.930
which is the fastest growing
food company ever in terms

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:46.380
of its sales and certainly its
impact on sector of industry.

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:49.570
That company is producing
a plant-based alternative

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:50.950
to eggs.

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:54.580
And the product is already in
tens of thousands of stores.

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:57.090
It's being picked up by
the biggest food companies.

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:01.750
And Josh just did that on
his side time with HSUS.

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:04.930
So what I wanted to
do today is give you

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:09.470
a little bit of a picture of
what the animal protection

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:13.480
cause is about, but
also to talk to you

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:17.360
about some of the themes
of the upcoming book

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:18.480
that I'm working on.

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:21.210
It'll be out in March,
called "The Humane Economy",

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:24.090
where essentially I'm
arguing that we're

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:28.160
in a revolutionary moment in
terms of our human relationship

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:29.450
with animals.

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:33.750
And that part of
the driving activity

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:37.180
is entrepreneurialism
and innovation

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:42.010
making many forms of traditional
animal exploitation obsolete.

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:45.350
And that we're going to have new
options and opportunities that

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:47.850
are going to require
no sacrifice for us,

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:51.180
but that are going to up-end
many conventional uses

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:52.460
of animals.

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:56.760
So the opening slide
here, of course,

00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:59.430
is kind of the
archetypal example

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:02.280
of what I think of as
the humane economy, which

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:03.650
is whale watching.

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:06.310
The United States used to
be the greatest whaling

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:09.080
nation in the world--
greatest not in terms of best,

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:11.340
but greatest in
terms of largest.

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:17.770
And ships would leave the ports
on mainly the East Coast--

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:21.060
Nantucket and New Bedford,
and ply the world's oceans,

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:25.380
and kill fin whales and right
whales and humpback whales,

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:30.160
and exploit them for their
oil and their blubber.

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:32.930
But of course, then there
was a huge innovation

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:37.780
in terms of petroleum, which
made whale oil obsolete.

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:39.810
Our values began to progress.

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:43.290
We used to think of whales
as just these things.

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:46.350
We began to recognize they're
the largest creatures who've

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:48.470
ever lived on the
planet, and maybe we

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:50.590
should start to protect them.

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:55.500
So we, as a nation, went
from this incredible industry

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:59.200
where mansions and big buildings
were built around the whaling

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:00.380
economy.

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:02.455
And now the whaling ships
are just in museums.

00:03:02.455 --> 00:03:05.790
If you go to Nantucket, you
can go to the Whaling Museum.

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:08.570
But you won't see any
US whalers in operation.

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:11.420
And I think that is
an indicator of what's

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:15.590
going to happen in so many
other sectors of the animal use

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:16.916
economy.

00:03:16.916 --> 00:03:18.790
So just a quick word
about the Humane Society

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:19.665
of the United States.

00:03:19.665 --> 00:03:24.580
We're one of 25,000 animal
protection organizations

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:25.480
in the United States.

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:27.470
We're the largest of them.

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:31.370
But there are local humane
societies that are SPCA's.

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:34.730
There are 13,000 or 14,000
animal rescue groups,

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:36.340
whether they're
doing feral cats,

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:38.610
or they're doing
dog rescue by breed.

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:41.650
There may be a St Bernard
rescue or Chihuahua rescue.

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:44.480
There are hundreds of wildlife
rehabilitation facilities

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:46.360
all around the United States.

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:48.347
Then there are groups of
focus on farm animals.

00:03:48.347 --> 00:03:49.930
There are groups
just devoted to that,

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:51.830
or animals that
are entertainment.

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:55.520
Or there are groups to protect
black bears, or mountain lions.

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:57.580
There's this
incredible pluralism

00:03:57.580 --> 00:04:00.160
that exists when it
comes to our relationship

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:04.560
with animals that's reflected in
so many different organizations

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:08.060
which, collectively, are really
in the marrow of our culture

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:08.980
now.

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:12.100
There is just no question that
animal protection sensibilities

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:17.160
are part of our American
ethos, and increasingly,

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:19.764
the global ethos, in terms
of the human relationship

00:04:19.764 --> 00:04:22.440
to animals and Nature.

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:25.140
So we do protect
all animals, which

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:29.057
was the reason for this slide--
that we're not just about dogs.

00:04:29.057 --> 00:04:30.140
We're not just about cats.

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:31.306
We're not just about horses.

00:04:31.306 --> 00:04:33.070
We're about all creatures.

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:34.550
They all matter in this world.

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:36.710
And we want to be
their advocates.

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:40.120
We've been around for a
little more than 60 years.

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:43.710
And this is the
chair of the board

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:45.550
starting the organization.

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:49.680
And the humane movement
really got its start

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:53.410
in the period right
after the Civil War.

00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:57.010
So after the United States dealt
with his great moral problem

00:04:57.010 --> 00:04:59.307
of slavery, people
began to think

00:04:59.307 --> 00:05:00.890
about our responsibilities
to animals.

00:05:00.890 --> 00:05:04.070
And most social movements
are born out of crisis.

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:05.730
There's a terrible
circumstance that

00:05:05.730 --> 00:05:09.770
warrants people of conscience
to rise up and do something.

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:13.000
And the environmental movement
really began in the 1860s,

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:17.240
with this
hyperexploitation of Nature

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:21.190
as we were conducting
our westward expansion

00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:22.660
in the United States.

00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:25.033
And we were liquidating
the buffalo, and the elk,

00:05:25.033 --> 00:05:27.374
and the wolves, and all
of the other creatures.

00:05:27.374 --> 00:05:29.290
And there were some
people who said, no, we've

00:05:29.290 --> 00:05:30.700
got to place limits on this.

00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:33.660
And George Perkins Marsh
wrote a book called

00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:36.480
"Man and Nature" in 1862.

00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:40.430
And he saw the beginning
of a conservation ethic

00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:43.070
which, a couple of
decades later, was really

00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:47.720
typified by Theodore Roosevelt.
But around the same time,

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:50.410
we also saw the humane
movement organizing.

00:05:50.410 --> 00:05:53.620
And the biggest
form of abuse was

00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:56.580
the abuse of horses in cities.

00:05:56.580 --> 00:05:59.020
We were this agrarian economy.

00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:02.740
But we began to see new
immigrant communities.

00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:06.290
And we began to
aggregate ourselves

00:06:06.290 --> 00:06:09.510
in these bustling
cities of Philadelphia,

00:06:09.510 --> 00:06:11.160
New York, and other cities.

00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:14.760
And people were using
horses for transportation.

00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:16.580
And people were
overworking horses.

00:06:16.580 --> 00:06:18.360
They were beating horses.

00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:20.450
They were overloading horses.

00:06:20.450 --> 00:06:22.320
And Henry Bergh, for
one, in New York--

00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:24.760
a New York socialite-- said
we have got to stop it.

00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:28.090
And he formed the ASPCA,
the American Society

00:06:28.090 --> 00:06:29.800
for the Prevention of
Cruelty to Animals.

00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:33.130
And then in the
late 1860s, 1870s,

00:06:33.130 --> 00:06:34.630
there were similar
groups created

00:06:34.630 --> 00:06:36.880
in different communities all
around the United States.

00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:39.480
So the Humane Society
of the United States

00:06:39.480 --> 00:06:40.520
came many years later.

00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:43.370
It actually spun off from
another organization.

00:06:43.370 --> 00:06:48.850
And the chairman of the board
said, driving us to organize

00:06:48.850 --> 00:06:52.000
was the feeling that the
American Humane Movement

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.540
needed a national society
that would stand absolutely

00:06:54.540 --> 00:06:57.160
on humane moral principles--
an organization that

00:06:57.160 --> 00:07:00.380
would unequivocally,
vigorously, adamantly oppose

00:07:00.380 --> 00:07:04.660
any and every kind of cruelty,
no matter by whom committed,

00:07:04.660 --> 00:07:08.860
and without concern for who
might be offended or alienated.

00:07:08.860 --> 00:07:13.180
The notion was that there
were lots of local groups.

00:07:13.180 --> 00:07:15.060
They were doing
critically important work

00:07:15.060 --> 00:07:18.630
in their communities,
most of it rescue.

00:07:18.630 --> 00:07:22.760
But who was going to address
the root causes of cruelty?

00:07:22.760 --> 00:07:26.200
Rescuing, while vital because
animals are in crisis,

00:07:26.200 --> 00:07:29.890
inevitably addresses the
symptoms of a problem.

00:07:29.890 --> 00:07:32.920
What is the cause or the
impetus for the exploitation

00:07:32.920 --> 00:07:34.360
in the first place?

00:07:34.360 --> 00:07:37.730
If you're just rescuing the
victims after they're injured,

00:07:37.730 --> 00:07:40.280
in some ways you're late.

00:07:40.280 --> 00:07:42.550
And you're also
not getting at why

00:07:42.550 --> 00:07:44.710
the circumstance
exists that's producing

00:07:44.710 --> 00:07:47.980
this terrible
condition for animals.

00:07:47.980 --> 00:07:52.250
So one of the big precepts
that we operate with is,

00:07:52.250 --> 00:07:55.690
you cannot rescue your way
out of the crisis for animals.

00:07:55.690 --> 00:08:00.270
Think about our world, and
how many animals there are.

00:08:00.270 --> 00:08:03.940
We've got 171 million dogs
and cats in our homes.

00:08:03.940 --> 00:08:08.460
There are anywhere from 10
to 100 million feral cats

00:08:08.460 --> 00:08:12.070
roaming outside in
the United States.

00:08:12.070 --> 00:08:15.940
In the US, we raise 9
billion animals a year

00:08:15.940 --> 00:08:19.820
for food, 70 billion worldwide.

00:08:19.820 --> 00:08:23.220
The 7 billion people on the
planet-- for every one of them,

00:08:23.220 --> 00:08:25.630
there are 10 farm animals.

00:08:25.630 --> 00:08:27.310
There are billions
of wild animals,

00:08:27.310 --> 00:08:30.610
countless, countless
billions of wild animals,

00:08:30.610 --> 00:08:32.010
of hundreds of species.

00:08:32.010 --> 00:08:34.539
I think there are
8,000 species of birds.

00:08:34.539 --> 00:08:36.610
There are thousands
of mammal species.

00:08:36.610 --> 00:08:40.940
And then when you go to other
categories or classifications

00:08:40.940 --> 00:08:44.764
of animals, there are
thousands more of them.

00:08:44.764 --> 00:08:46.180
Animals are used
in entertainment.

00:08:46.180 --> 00:08:47.150
They're used in science.

00:08:47.150 --> 00:08:48.160
They're used in
wildlife management.

00:08:48.160 --> 00:08:50.120
They're used in food
and agriculture.

00:08:50.120 --> 00:08:53.280
They're used in so
many different domains.

00:08:53.280 --> 00:08:56.730
If we were really good,
and spent our resources

00:08:56.730 --> 00:08:59.710
very effectively, maybe we could
rescue 500,000, or 600,000,

00:08:59.710 --> 00:09:02.610
or 700,000 animals in a year.

00:09:02.610 --> 00:09:06.780
But by working to change the
way institutions operate,

00:09:06.780 --> 00:09:09.110
and getting animals
out of circumstances

00:09:09.110 --> 00:09:12.760
where alternatives now exist,
or making things more humane,

00:09:12.760 --> 00:09:15.824
we can affect the lives
of billions of animals.

00:09:15.824 --> 00:09:17.740
So at the Humane Society
of the United States,

00:09:17.740 --> 00:09:19.160
more than any
other organization,

00:09:19.160 --> 00:09:23.060
take a highly strategic
approach to how

00:09:23.060 --> 00:09:27.970
we confront this human
relationship with animals.

00:09:27.970 --> 00:09:32.150
And at base level,
it's not so much

00:09:32.150 --> 00:09:34.840
that we talk about
animal rights.

00:09:34.840 --> 00:09:38.250
It's a common term that
people use-- animal rights.

00:09:38.250 --> 00:09:40.730
A lot of people debate, do
animals have natural rights?

00:09:40.730 --> 00:09:43.050
Do we confer them upon animals?

00:09:43.050 --> 00:09:45.290
We kind of sidestep
that entire question,

00:09:45.290 --> 00:09:48.062
because really, it's about us.

00:09:48.062 --> 00:09:49.520
It's not so much
about the animals.

00:09:49.520 --> 00:09:51.450
I mean, yes, we
have to understand

00:09:51.450 --> 00:09:53.880
that animals are conscious.

00:09:53.880 --> 00:09:55.240
They're thinking.

00:09:55.240 --> 00:09:57.050
They have feelings.

00:09:57.050 --> 00:09:58.980
They have families.

00:09:58.980 --> 00:10:04.030
They value their lives as
much as we value our lives.

00:10:04.030 --> 00:10:06.430
But it's we who are doing
these things to these animals.

00:10:06.430 --> 00:10:08.904
It's more about us
than it is about them.

00:10:08.904 --> 00:10:10.570
So rather than talk
about animal rights,

00:10:10.570 --> 00:10:13.130
we talk about human
responsibility.

00:10:13.130 --> 00:10:16.540
How do we handle
the immense power

00:10:16.540 --> 00:10:19.540
that we have over
other creatures?

00:10:19.540 --> 00:10:23.330
We hear this term
"asymmetry" in defense

00:10:23.330 --> 00:10:26.230
and international relations--
that the United States

00:10:26.230 --> 00:10:28.520
has an asymmetrical
relationship to other countries

00:10:28.520 --> 00:10:30.700
because we have all this power.

00:10:30.700 --> 00:10:33.640
Well, we have an asymmetrical
relationship with animals.

00:10:33.640 --> 00:10:36.380
We hold all the cards.

00:10:36.380 --> 00:10:38.030
They are at our mercy.

00:10:38.030 --> 00:10:41.560
We can do anything we want to
them, because we are so much

00:10:41.560 --> 00:10:43.140
more powerful than they are.

00:10:43.140 --> 00:10:44.790
Think back to that
period when we

00:10:44.790 --> 00:10:49.030
were liquidating these
wildlife species in the 18060s.

00:10:49.030 --> 00:10:51.800
150 years ago, we
had that power.

00:10:51.800 --> 00:10:53.720
There were 40 to
60 million buffalo

00:10:53.720 --> 00:10:55.680
that were roaming the
mid-section of the North

00:10:55.680 --> 00:10:56.780
American continent.

00:10:56.780 --> 00:10:59.750
We dropped their numbers
to 500 in the span

00:10:59.750 --> 00:11:01.780
of about three decades.

00:11:01.780 --> 00:11:04.770
We wiped out billions
of Passenger Pigeons

00:11:04.770 --> 00:11:06.330
in the span of 40 years.

00:11:06.330 --> 00:11:08.980
The last one died in
captivity in 1914.

00:11:08.980 --> 00:11:12.050
So even then, a century
ago, we had the power

00:11:12.050 --> 00:11:14.840
to liquidate entire species,
wipe them from the planet.

00:11:14.840 --> 00:11:17.920
Imagine now what we can
do with our technology.

00:11:17.920 --> 00:11:20.620
So it's really about who we are.

00:11:20.620 --> 00:11:23.970
So these are the four
areas in which we work.

00:11:23.970 --> 00:11:26.780
We do rescue and direct
care, because, as I said,

00:11:26.780 --> 00:11:28.350
animals are in crisis.

00:11:28.350 --> 00:11:30.050
We've got a whole
range of programs

00:11:30.050 --> 00:11:32.150
where we come to
the aid of animals.

00:11:32.150 --> 00:11:34.500
Second is we do public
awareness and education,

00:11:34.500 --> 00:11:38.990
because so many people
care about animals.

00:11:38.990 --> 00:11:42.520
But they don't know what
problems afflict them.

00:11:42.520 --> 00:11:44.970
We need to educate people
about what's going on,

00:11:44.970 --> 00:11:50.020
and also to provide solutions
so people of conscience can act.

00:11:50.020 --> 00:11:52.960
We also try to shape
the laws, because laws

00:11:52.960 --> 00:11:57.130
are designed in a civil
society to maintain order,

00:11:57.130 --> 00:12:00.100
but they're also designed
to reflect our values.

00:12:00.100 --> 00:12:03.420
They're the rules of the
road for civil society.

00:12:03.420 --> 00:12:06.200
And when it comes to
animals, we need standards.

00:12:06.200 --> 00:12:10.230
A tiny percentage of people in
a society of 320 million people

00:12:10.230 --> 00:12:12.250
can create a lot of havoc.

00:12:12.250 --> 00:12:14.980
Look at Michael Vick
in dog fighting,

00:12:14.980 --> 00:12:17.820
or other people involved
in dog fighting.

00:12:17.820 --> 00:12:20.290
You could have
just 10,000 people

00:12:20.290 --> 00:12:23.020
involved in an enterprise
like dog fighting,

00:12:23.020 --> 00:12:26.510
and victimize hundreds
of thousands of dogs.

00:12:26.510 --> 00:12:30.300
So we must have rules to
set a baseline standard

00:12:30.300 --> 00:12:32.820
that folks can't violate.

00:12:32.820 --> 00:12:35.240
And it's not just a matter
of our personal preference.

00:12:35.240 --> 00:12:36.890
There are lives at stake.

00:12:36.890 --> 00:12:39.570
You're shielding
vulnerable creatures

00:12:39.570 --> 00:12:43.476
from cruelty and abuse, which
is a core value in our society.

00:12:43.476 --> 00:12:45.100
And finally, and I
think this is really

00:12:45.100 --> 00:12:47.590
the theme of what I wanted
to talk about today,

00:12:47.590 --> 00:12:49.830
is our corporate reform work.

00:12:49.830 --> 00:12:53.490
Obviously, Google and
the many companies

00:12:53.490 --> 00:12:55.350
that are associated
with Google have

00:12:55.350 --> 00:12:59.740
been part of this incredible
information and technology

00:12:59.740 --> 00:13:04.660
revolution in the last 20
years, the last quarter century.

00:13:04.660 --> 00:13:08.410
I mean, it's reshaped
our entire economy.

00:13:08.410 --> 00:13:10.290
That's what we need for animals.

00:13:10.290 --> 00:13:12.170
That's what we're
trying to drive.

00:13:12.170 --> 00:13:15.070
And you're going to see today
how so many companies are

00:13:15.070 --> 00:13:18.360
really at the leading
edge of a revolution

00:13:18.360 --> 00:13:21.410
in our human relationship
to animals and Nature.

00:13:21.410 --> 00:13:24.270
But those are the
four legs of the table

00:13:24.270 --> 00:13:27.050
on which all of the
activities of the Humane

00:13:27.050 --> 00:13:30.800
Society of the United States
and its affiliates stand.

00:13:30.800 --> 00:13:32.921
And again, one of
the great things

00:13:32.921 --> 00:13:34.420
about our work at
the Humane Society

00:13:34.420 --> 00:13:37.680
is, we don't have to invent
a social concern for animals.

00:13:37.680 --> 00:13:42.470
The book that you may have
passed by walking in here,

00:13:42.470 --> 00:13:44.550
I wrote a book called
"The Bond," where

00:13:44.550 --> 00:13:47.630
I argue that we humans have
an instinctive relationship

00:13:47.630 --> 00:13:49.300
to other creatures.

00:13:49.300 --> 00:13:50.350
Kids-- you see it.

00:13:50.350 --> 00:13:56.060
I mean you were all kids at
one point, I imagine, right?

00:13:56.060 --> 00:13:58.540
Kids have this connection
to other creatures.

00:13:58.540 --> 00:14:00.480
I mean, it's manifest
by kids being

00:14:00.480 --> 00:14:02.150
fascinated by animals on TV.

00:14:02.150 --> 00:14:03.830
They have animals as toys.

00:14:03.830 --> 00:14:07.385
90% of the images in
kids' books are animals.

00:14:07.385 --> 00:14:09.010
There are so many
different expressions

00:14:09.010 --> 00:14:10.801
of this, which I'll
talk about in a moment.

00:14:10.801 --> 00:14:13.310
But people love animals.

00:14:13.310 --> 00:14:17.270
If we start with that,
we have a head start

00:14:17.270 --> 00:14:19.490
in the fight to help animals.

00:14:19.490 --> 00:14:24.250
And we're now spending more
than $60 billion a year

00:14:24.250 --> 00:14:26.675
on our dogs and cats,
171 million dogs

00:14:26.675 --> 00:14:27.550
and cats in our home.

00:14:27.550 --> 00:14:29.450
So you can get all
sorts of things.

00:14:29.450 --> 00:14:31.700
There are spa treatments
for animals now.

00:14:31.700 --> 00:14:33.450
There's organic food.

00:14:33.450 --> 00:14:36.110
And there's so many
different expressions

00:14:36.110 --> 00:14:38.060
of this love and appreciation.

00:14:38.060 --> 00:14:40.990
And most people consider
them part of the family.

00:14:40.990 --> 00:14:43.940
We also love to see wildlife.

00:14:43.940 --> 00:14:47.440
We have a whole network of
National Parks, National

00:14:47.440 --> 00:14:50.720
Forests, Bureau of
Land Management lands.

00:14:50.720 --> 00:14:52.680
We've got state parks.

00:14:52.680 --> 00:14:54.330
We've got city parks.

00:14:54.330 --> 00:14:58.880
Even in the kind of
greatest expression

00:14:58.880 --> 00:15:02.700
of human civilization and
physical and architectural

00:15:02.700 --> 00:15:05.655
development like New York City--
right in the middle of the city

00:15:05.655 --> 00:15:07.070
is a park.

00:15:07.070 --> 00:15:08.480
The planners
designed it that way

00:15:08.480 --> 00:15:10.950
because we're
connected to Nature.

00:15:10.950 --> 00:15:13.370
Even when we have
tall skyscrapers,

00:15:13.370 --> 00:15:15.861
we still want to
be around nature.

00:15:15.861 --> 00:15:17.360
We're the first
country in the world

00:15:17.360 --> 00:15:20.701
to create a National
Park-- 1872, Yellowstone--

00:15:20.701 --> 00:15:22.700
and now it's been emulated
throughout the world.

00:15:22.700 --> 00:15:25.430
There's a network of national
parks all throughout the world,

00:15:25.430 --> 00:15:28.640
because it's a
tonic to our soul.

00:15:28.640 --> 00:15:30.260
We need to be in Nature.

00:15:30.260 --> 00:15:31.440
It's part of who we are.

00:15:31.440 --> 00:15:33.540
Because for 99%
of human history,

00:15:33.540 --> 00:15:35.590
we were living in
pre-agricultural settings.

00:15:35.590 --> 00:15:37.320
We were tribal societies.

00:15:37.320 --> 00:15:39.650
The tribal societies had
an intimate knowledge

00:15:39.650 --> 00:15:41.580
of the animals in the forest.

00:15:41.580 --> 00:15:43.730
They knew when they bred.

00:15:43.730 --> 00:15:45.310
They knew what they were like.

00:15:45.310 --> 00:15:47.500
They knew the floral
kingdom as well.

00:15:47.500 --> 00:15:49.890
Nature is built into
every one of us.

00:15:49.890 --> 00:15:53.260
And I argue in my
book that it really

00:15:53.260 --> 00:15:56.290
is a sort of biophilia--
a love of nature

00:15:56.290 --> 00:15:58.870
that's built into
each one of us.

00:15:58.870 --> 00:16:00.930
And it's manifest
with all the wildlife

00:16:00.930 --> 00:16:03.360
watching that goes on as well.

00:16:03.360 --> 00:16:07.631
But it's broader than that.

00:16:07.631 --> 00:16:10.090
We have 2/3 of
American households,

00:16:10.090 --> 00:16:11.520
as I mentioned, have a pet.

00:16:11.520 --> 00:16:14.530
91% of people
consider their pets

00:16:14.530 --> 00:16:16.310
to be members of the family.

00:16:16.310 --> 00:16:18.860
95% of us agree
it's important to me

00:16:18.860 --> 00:16:20.800
that farm animals
are well cared for,

00:16:20.800 --> 00:16:23.410
because the way that we
interact with animals more

00:16:23.410 --> 00:16:26.120
than any other is on our plates.

00:16:26.120 --> 00:16:29.300
The average American
eats 31 animals a year.

00:16:29.300 --> 00:16:34.360
So think of 320 million
people times 30 or 31.

00:16:34.360 --> 00:16:35.880
That's 9 billion animals.

00:16:35.880 --> 00:16:37.560
That's how you get that total.

00:16:37.560 --> 00:16:40.090
Most of them are chickens,
because they're small.

00:16:40.090 --> 00:16:42.610
If we ate just beef, it
would be a far smaller number

00:16:42.610 --> 00:16:45.200
of animals, because
they're larger.

00:16:45.200 --> 00:16:46.100
They go farther.

00:16:46.100 --> 00:16:47.560
But you eat a
piece of a chicken,

00:16:47.560 --> 00:16:49.600
it's like a third
of the chicken.

00:16:49.600 --> 00:16:54.080
And that accounts for
this enormous number

00:16:54.080 --> 00:16:57.220
of animals used for food
production in our society.

00:16:57.220 --> 00:17:01.440
But even with that, people
want to see those animals more

00:17:01.440 --> 00:17:03.610
humanely treated than they are.

00:17:03.610 --> 00:17:07.250
As I mentioned, lots of
people watch wildlife.

00:17:07.250 --> 00:17:10.230
This is an interesting chart.

00:17:10.230 --> 00:17:14.290
In 1985, just a few years before
I got to the Humane Society,

00:17:14.290 --> 00:17:16.670
this was what the
legal situation

00:17:16.670 --> 00:17:20.450
looked like with three
types of animal cruelty.

00:17:20.450 --> 00:17:24.700
States that had felony level
penalties for dog fighting,

00:17:24.700 --> 00:17:28.310
and anti-dog fighting
laws in general, states

00:17:28.310 --> 00:17:32.420
had anti-cock fighting laws
with felony level penalties.

00:17:32.420 --> 00:17:34.020
Then states that
had a general animal

00:17:34.020 --> 00:17:36.740
cruelty statute, where
malicious cruelty

00:17:36.740 --> 00:17:38.160
was treated as a felony.

00:17:38.160 --> 00:17:42.030
You can see that just a
small number of states

00:17:42.030 --> 00:17:44.970
had these statutes in 1985.

00:17:44.970 --> 00:17:47.090
It was really a
patchwork with about 10,

00:17:47.090 --> 00:17:50.470
12 states with felony level
penalties for dog fighting,

00:17:50.470 --> 00:17:52.220
smaller number
with cock fighting,

00:17:52.220 --> 00:17:54.480
and a very small number
with felony cruelty.

00:17:54.480 --> 00:17:56.762
We said at the Humane
Society, this can't stand.

00:17:56.762 --> 00:17:58.720
I mean, if we're going
to advocate for animals,

00:17:58.720 --> 00:18:01.250
there must be a baseline
standard with cruelty.

00:18:01.250 --> 00:18:04.390
So we have methodically
gone state by state,

00:18:04.390 --> 00:18:06.280
and now this is what
the map looks like.

00:18:06.280 --> 00:18:08.280
We have filled out the map.

00:18:08.280 --> 00:18:14.660
This notion that animal cruelty
is wrong is now universal.

00:18:14.660 --> 00:18:18.570
It's now treated as a
serious crime to be malicious

00:18:18.570 --> 00:18:20.360
and to be cruel
toward an animal.

00:18:20.360 --> 00:18:21.550
You can go to jail.

00:18:21.550 --> 00:18:23.044
You can be fined.

00:18:23.044 --> 00:18:24.710
And really, one of
the things that we're

00:18:24.710 --> 00:18:27.630
doing at the Humane
Society of the US

00:18:27.630 --> 00:18:32.530
is saying, OK, if
animal cruelty is wrong,

00:18:32.530 --> 00:18:36.720
if this is a moral problem,
how do we logically

00:18:36.720 --> 00:18:41.640
apply anti-cruelty principles
in a world where animals are

00:18:41.640 --> 00:18:45.140
embedded in so many
different aspects of our life

00:18:45.140 --> 00:18:46.760
and in the economy?

00:18:46.760 --> 00:18:47.710
They're used for food.

00:18:47.710 --> 00:18:49.330
They're used in science.

00:18:49.330 --> 00:18:50.610
Wildlife are all around us.

00:18:50.610 --> 00:18:52.090
They're used in the pet trade.

00:18:52.090 --> 00:18:54.160
They're used in entertainment.

00:18:54.160 --> 00:18:59.420
If this notion is
meaningful, and it's sticky,

00:18:59.420 --> 00:19:03.400
we've got to more logically
apply the principle.

00:19:03.400 --> 00:19:05.430
So that's really what
we're engaging in

00:19:05.430 --> 00:19:07.360
at the organization.

00:19:07.360 --> 00:19:11.180
And this really leads to
this notion of a disconnect.

00:19:11.180 --> 00:19:13.075
We say that we love animals.

00:19:13.075 --> 00:19:15.200
We have all that pet keeping
and wildlife watching.

00:19:15.200 --> 00:19:17.070
We have anti-cruelty laws.

00:19:17.070 --> 00:19:20.430
Most people-- just about
every decent person's

00:19:20.430 --> 00:19:23.900
not going to say it's OK
to be cruel to an animal.

00:19:23.900 --> 00:19:27.730
Yet we live in a world where
there's so much exploitation.

00:19:27.730 --> 00:19:30.750
I mean, we have this
tangled, contradictory, even

00:19:30.750 --> 00:19:33.300
schizophrenic
relationship with animals.

00:19:33.300 --> 00:19:37.380
And that's the cultural
and economic climate

00:19:37.380 --> 00:19:39.610
in which we're operating
right now, as we do

00:19:39.610 --> 00:19:42.230
our work at the Humane Society.

00:19:42.230 --> 00:19:43.170
Think of pets.

00:19:43.170 --> 00:19:45.030
We love our pets.

00:19:45.030 --> 00:19:49.080
Yet we have 10,000 puppy
mills in the United States,

00:19:49.080 --> 00:19:50.910
churning out dogs
for the pet trade,

00:19:50.910 --> 00:19:54.280
keeping the mother dogs
in cages, in confinement,

00:19:54.280 --> 00:19:57.370
exposing them to extremes
of heat and cold,

00:19:57.370 --> 00:20:01.880
denying them vet care, not
providing proper socialization.

00:20:01.880 --> 00:20:04.540
At a time when we're struggling
with the local humane studies,

00:20:04.540 --> 00:20:08.580
SPCA's and county and municipal
animal care control facilities

00:20:08.580 --> 00:20:10.630
to adopt out animals
and stop euthanasia,

00:20:10.630 --> 00:20:13.480
we're still euthanizing
3 million healthy dogs

00:20:13.480 --> 00:20:16.470
and cats every year in the US.

00:20:16.470 --> 00:20:17.960
This is an image
of a puppy mill.

00:20:17.960 --> 00:20:19.920
Many of these puppy
mill operators

00:20:19.920 --> 00:20:21.390
used to be involved
in agriculture.

00:20:21.390 --> 00:20:23.431
They were pig farmers who
got out of the business

00:20:23.431 --> 00:20:24.880
and started raising dogs.

00:20:24.880 --> 00:20:28.970
And they adopt many of the same
strategies in raising them.

00:20:28.970 --> 00:20:32.690
They're kind of a
production unit.

00:20:32.690 --> 00:20:34.660
But there's a change happening.

00:20:34.660 --> 00:20:39.740
And PetSmart and Petco,
as two big pet supply

00:20:39.740 --> 00:20:43.350
chains in the mid 1990s
said, we're going to stop.

00:20:43.350 --> 00:20:48.320
We're not going to continue
selling dogs from puppy mills

00:20:48.320 --> 00:20:49.880
at our pet stores.

00:20:49.880 --> 00:20:53.270
We're now going to partner with
rescue groups and shelters,

00:20:53.270 --> 00:20:56.220
and make dogs and cats
available at our facilities.

00:20:56.220 --> 00:20:59.470
And since that time, more
than 10 million dogs and cats

00:20:59.470 --> 00:21:04.190
have been adopted out through
PetSmart and Petco outlets.

00:21:04.190 --> 00:21:06.050
This is part of this
new humane economy.

00:21:06.050 --> 00:21:09.880
In fact, in 2014 the
largest private equity deal

00:21:09.880 --> 00:21:14.660
in the world was
PetSmart being purchased

00:21:14.660 --> 00:21:17.640
for more than $7 billion by
a London-based private equity

00:21:17.640 --> 00:21:18.140
firm.

00:21:18.140 --> 00:21:22.150
So the biggest global
private equity deal

00:21:22.150 --> 00:21:26.790
was a pet store company-- quite
an amazing change in the world.

00:21:29.490 --> 00:21:32.800
There are other problems
for dogs in the world.

00:21:32.800 --> 00:21:37.790
And 20 million slaughtered in
Asia for human consumption.

00:21:37.790 --> 00:21:39.240
We've been working to stop this.

00:21:39.240 --> 00:21:41.740
We're working with
Chinese advocates

00:21:41.740 --> 00:21:44.830
to stop this on the
ground in that country.

00:21:44.830 --> 00:21:47.330
The images are horrifying.

00:21:47.330 --> 00:21:50.910
If you go to our website, we've
got a whole video channel.

00:21:50.910 --> 00:21:53.560
Our teams have helped to
shut down several farms.

00:21:53.560 --> 00:21:55.820
We've actually brought a
number of these dogs back.

00:21:55.820 --> 00:21:59.070
In fact, we brought some of
them to San Francisco recently.

00:21:59.070 --> 00:22:00.570
Several of the farms
were shut down,

00:22:00.570 --> 00:22:03.290
and we adopted a bunch them
out through the San Francisco

00:22:03.290 --> 00:22:06.015
SPCA and a number of
other local societies.

00:22:08.530 --> 00:22:10.846
The use of animals in
entertainment-- many of you,

00:22:10.846 --> 00:22:12.220
I'm sure, have
heard, some of you

00:22:12.220 --> 00:22:14.990
have watched the
documentary, "Blackfish--"

00:22:14.990 --> 00:22:19.530
one documentary exposing Sea
World's mistreatment of orcas,

00:22:19.530 --> 00:22:23.230
the history of capturing them
from their pods in the wild,

00:22:23.230 --> 00:22:28.070
bringing them into captivity,
high mortality rates,

00:22:28.070 --> 00:22:31.760
very shortened lifespans,
and constant frustrations

00:22:31.760 --> 00:22:35.520
for animals that roam 10s
and 10s of miles every day

00:22:35.520 --> 00:22:36.640
in the ocean.

00:22:36.640 --> 00:22:39.760
They live in family groups where
they stay with their family

00:22:39.760 --> 00:22:41.590
members for a lifetime.

00:22:41.590 --> 00:22:45.160
There's one orca
off of Puget Sound

00:22:45.160 --> 00:22:49.160
who is estimated to have
turned 106 recently.

00:22:49.160 --> 00:22:51.609
I mean, these animals
are incredible.

00:22:51.609 --> 00:22:53.400
They're the biggest
predators in the world.

00:22:53.400 --> 00:22:56.540
And they're in a little
tank at Sea World,

00:22:56.540 --> 00:22:58.000
like a big swimming pool.

00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:00.500
It'd be like you and me living
in a closet for the rest

00:23:00.500 --> 00:23:04.250
of our lives-- away from
their family members,

00:23:04.250 --> 00:23:07.720
eternally frustrated, biting
at the side of the pool,

00:23:07.720 --> 00:23:10.867
scraping their face,
breaking their teeth.

00:23:10.867 --> 00:23:12.450
And occasionally,
some of the trainers

00:23:12.450 --> 00:23:15.090
get killed, because
they're so frustrated.

00:23:15.090 --> 00:23:15.890
They lash out.

00:23:15.890 --> 00:23:17.750
They get angry and
upset, just like we

00:23:17.750 --> 00:23:21.550
would if we were in a
situation of deprivation,

00:23:21.550 --> 00:23:24.630
if we were in
solitary confinement.

00:23:24.630 --> 00:23:26.670
What's amazing is so many
kids and other people

00:23:26.670 --> 00:23:29.600
have responded, Sea World
stock, after one documentary

00:23:29.600 --> 00:23:31.360
was aired, has gone down.

00:23:31.360 --> 00:23:32.670
It was up well above 40.

00:23:32.670 --> 00:23:34.900
Now it's less than 20.

00:23:34.900 --> 00:23:37.255
And CNN kept replaying
this documentary.

00:23:37.255 --> 00:23:41.320
And of course, now people have
access to things like YouTube.

00:23:41.320 --> 00:23:43.860
And they can see this stuff.

00:23:43.860 --> 00:23:46.940
We're really closing the
gap between what people want

00:23:46.940 --> 00:23:50.140
and what happens, because we're
giving people information.

00:23:50.140 --> 00:23:51.990
And Google, and
YouTube, and others

00:23:51.990 --> 00:23:54.190
are part of that
information revolution

00:23:54.190 --> 00:23:57.970
that's changing the way people
are behaving, because they have

00:23:57.970 --> 00:24:00.980
information they can act upon.

00:24:00.980 --> 00:24:03.070
These channels of
information delivery

00:24:03.070 --> 00:24:06.080
are crucial to building
a humane economy,

00:24:06.080 --> 00:24:09.510
because the basis of it is
an informed consumer who's

00:24:09.510 --> 00:24:11.470
making choices in
the marketplace

00:24:11.470 --> 00:24:14.479
to reflect these sensibilities.

00:24:14.479 --> 00:24:17.020
And earlier this year, something
happened that I didn't think

00:24:17.020 --> 00:24:18.978
was going to happen for
another 10 or 20 years.

00:24:18.978 --> 00:24:21.620
Ringling Brothers decided
to give up its elephants

00:24:21.620 --> 00:24:22.686
in its circus acts.

00:24:22.686 --> 00:24:25.060
I mean, this is a company that
infiltrated animal welfare

00:24:25.060 --> 00:24:27.480
groups, that spent
$10s of millions

00:24:27.480 --> 00:24:29.090
to defend its use of elephants.

00:24:29.090 --> 00:24:31.510
And they realized
that customers didn't

00:24:31.510 --> 00:24:36.960
want these elephants to be on
chains 22 or 23 hours a day,

00:24:36.960 --> 00:24:41.555
shuttled in the box cars to
120 or 130 cities a year.

00:24:41.555 --> 00:24:43.055
The only time they
get off the chain

00:24:43.055 --> 00:24:47.164
is when they walk from their
miserable holding place

00:24:47.164 --> 00:24:49.830
to the arena where they're going
to do a performance, where they

00:24:49.830 --> 00:24:53.330
stand on their head-- where
a 180 pound person is giving

00:24:53.330 --> 00:24:55.212
a command to a
five-ton elephant.

00:24:55.212 --> 00:24:57.170
The only reason they do
that is because they're

00:24:57.170 --> 00:25:02.380
in fear, because they've been
brutalized with a bull hook

00:25:02.380 --> 00:25:06.090
or other apparatuses or
devices that cause them fear.

00:25:06.090 --> 00:25:08.910
In fact, the California
legislature just yesterday

00:25:08.910 --> 00:25:11.260
passed a bill to ban
the use of bull hooks

00:25:11.260 --> 00:25:12.757
statewide in a key committee.

00:25:12.757 --> 00:25:14.090
It's already passed one chamber.

00:25:14.090 --> 00:25:16.030
We hope it's soon to
go to the governor

00:25:16.030 --> 00:25:18.220
to stop the use of
these bull hooks, which

00:25:18.220 --> 00:25:22.490
are like a baseball bat with
a sharp metal hook on the end.

00:25:22.490 --> 00:25:24.450
And that's how they
dominate the elephants,

00:25:24.450 --> 00:25:26.790
and get them to
do what they want.

00:25:26.790 --> 00:25:28.904
Other circuses, like
International Circus,

00:25:28.904 --> 00:25:30.820
after Ringling made its
announcement in March,

00:25:30.820 --> 00:25:33.780
also said it's giving
up its elephants.

00:25:33.780 --> 00:25:37.450
So here's a cartoon where
the elephant is just telling

00:25:37.450 --> 00:25:39.550
the Sea World orca, "Hold on.

00:25:39.550 --> 00:25:44.670
Relief is coming."

00:25:44.670 --> 00:25:46.410
There's no species
that's had a bigger

00:25:46.410 --> 00:25:50.870
impact on the American
culture than the horse.

00:25:50.870 --> 00:25:54.257
I mean, horses changed our
notions of time and space.

00:25:54.257 --> 00:25:55.715
They allowed for
westward expansion

00:25:55.715 --> 00:25:58.950
in the US, allowed for transport
before the internal combustion

00:25:58.950 --> 00:26:00.490
engine.

00:26:00.490 --> 00:26:02.770
We owe horses a great
debt of gratitude.

00:26:02.770 --> 00:26:07.720
Yet we're shipping 150,000
horses a year from the US

00:26:07.720 --> 00:26:10.370
to slaughter plants
in Mexico and Canada,

00:26:10.370 --> 00:26:13.690
which slaughter the horses, then
ship them to Europe and Asia

00:26:13.690 --> 00:26:17.780
for human consumption-- I
mean, just a very poor way

00:26:17.780 --> 00:26:19.850
to pay back horses
for all that they've

00:26:19.850 --> 00:26:21.500
done for us in our culture.

00:26:21.500 --> 00:26:23.150
We're working to stop that.

00:26:23.150 --> 00:26:26.650
And we've gotten the Europeans
to suspend horse meat imports

00:26:26.650 --> 00:26:27.720
from Mexico.

00:26:27.720 --> 00:26:29.970
And we think that they may
be doing it soon in Canada.

00:26:29.970 --> 00:26:32.100
Because these horses are
coming up the racetrack.

00:26:32.100 --> 00:26:34.390
They're coming out of
working facilities.

00:26:34.390 --> 00:26:38.390
They're dosed with all sorts
of medicines that are forbidden

00:26:38.390 --> 00:26:39.830
for human consumption.

00:26:39.830 --> 00:26:42.940
It's amazing-- the Europeans
forbid US-produced chicken,

00:26:42.940 --> 00:26:46.140
pork, and beef from being
imported into the EU,

00:26:46.140 --> 00:26:51.860
because our American industrial
farmers dose these animals

00:26:51.860 --> 00:26:55.640
with drugs that the Europeans
consider to be unsafe.

00:26:55.640 --> 00:26:58.900
Yet we've got 129 different
drugs that are routinely

00:26:58.900 --> 00:27:01.585
used on horses that are not
fit for human consumption

00:27:01.585 --> 00:27:02.730
here in the US.

00:27:02.730 --> 00:27:04.570
The Europeans were
finally-- we finally

00:27:04.570 --> 00:27:08.880
convinced them to better align
their food safety policies

00:27:08.880 --> 00:27:11.280
for horses along with the
other species that are

00:27:11.280 --> 00:27:14.420
consumed for human consumption.

00:27:14.420 --> 00:27:16.950
And there's also a
tremendous love affair

00:27:16.950 --> 00:27:20.450
that we have with wildlife,
especially elephants.

00:27:20.450 --> 00:27:23.540
And we love elephants,
yet right now, there's

00:27:23.540 --> 00:27:28.360
a terrible crisis going on, with
35,000 elephants being killed

00:27:28.360 --> 00:27:31.040
a year, principally
for their ivory,

00:27:31.040 --> 00:27:34.460
principally by militias
and terrorist groups that

00:27:34.460 --> 00:27:37.120
are financing their terrorism
by slaughtering elephants

00:27:37.120 --> 00:27:38.540
and selling the ivory.

00:27:38.540 --> 00:27:41.230
If you don't have a bank to rob,
if you're out in a rural area,

00:27:41.230 --> 00:27:46.140
you can go slaughter elephants,
and translate ivory into cash,

00:27:46.140 --> 00:27:48.470
and finance efforts
to shoot up people

00:27:48.470 --> 00:27:52.920
at malls like the Westgate Mall
in Nairobi, or go to a school,

00:27:52.920 --> 00:27:57.980
as they did in Kenya, and
slaughter 70 or 80 students.

00:27:57.980 --> 00:28:02.050
The people doing the
poaching are terrorists.

00:28:02.050 --> 00:28:05.760
It's not just a poor African
who is trying to get by

00:28:05.760 --> 00:28:07.440
and killing an elephant.

00:28:07.440 --> 00:28:10.060
There is an incredible link
that's well documented.

00:28:10.060 --> 00:28:12.060
And we're fighting
this on the ground.

00:28:12.060 --> 00:28:14.570
But we're also fighting
it in the US and China,

00:28:14.570 --> 00:28:17.080
which are the two largest
markets for ivory.

00:28:17.080 --> 00:28:19.180
The reason that people
are killing elephants

00:28:19.180 --> 00:28:22.400
is because consumers are
placing value on the ivory.

00:28:22.400 --> 00:28:24.290
We've got to stop the
trade in the ivory

00:28:24.290 --> 00:28:28.260
if we're going to stop
the poaching in Africa.

00:28:28.260 --> 00:28:32.040
And in terms of
the humane economy,

00:28:32.040 --> 00:28:35.075
African elephants
are ecologically

00:28:35.075 --> 00:28:38.959
the keystone species
throughout so much of Africa.

00:28:38.959 --> 00:28:41.500
You protect the elephants, you
protect all the other animals.

00:28:41.500 --> 00:28:44.020
And the elephants have
this incredible impact

00:28:44.020 --> 00:28:45.280
on the vegetative community.

00:28:45.280 --> 00:28:47.010
They can knock down trees.

00:28:47.010 --> 00:28:49.580
They can create savanna.

00:28:49.580 --> 00:28:52.700
But they're also economically
the keystone species

00:28:52.700 --> 00:28:53.650
for Africa.

00:28:53.650 --> 00:28:55.700
Millions of people
throughout the world

00:28:55.700 --> 00:28:59.610
go to African countries to see
elephants, and also rhinos,

00:28:59.610 --> 00:29:02.220
and other great,
remarkable species--

00:29:02.220 --> 00:29:04.810
prehistoric looking creatures.

00:29:04.810 --> 00:29:06.870
It's billions of dollars.

00:29:06.870 --> 00:29:09.290
So there's been all sorts
of economic analysis--

00:29:09.290 --> 00:29:13.200
that a living elephant
is 76 times more

00:29:13.200 --> 00:29:15.690
valuable than a dead elephant.

00:29:15.690 --> 00:29:19.640
The humane economy
is about realizing

00:29:19.640 --> 00:29:22.910
what the true economic
potential of animals is.

00:29:22.910 --> 00:29:25.120
And they're much more
valuable alive than dead,

00:29:25.120 --> 00:29:27.270
as we discovered with whales.

00:29:27.270 --> 00:29:29.320
We now have a
multi-billion dollar whale

00:29:29.320 --> 00:29:32.110
watching industry that,
in comparative terms,

00:29:32.110 --> 00:29:35.180
would have dwarfed
what whaling was when

00:29:35.180 --> 00:29:37.780
it involved killing of whales.

00:29:37.780 --> 00:29:40.860
So that's the humane
economy in progress.

00:29:40.860 --> 00:29:43.050
Now even China has
announced that it's

00:29:43.050 --> 00:29:44.450
going to end the ivory trade.

00:29:44.450 --> 00:29:46.200
This is a very,
very hopeful sign.

00:29:46.200 --> 00:29:50.660
This announcement came
just a few weeks ago.

00:29:50.660 --> 00:29:54.230
And there are other forms
of exploitation of wildlife.

00:29:54.230 --> 00:29:56.710
The largest marine mammal
slaughter in the world

00:29:56.710 --> 00:29:58.470
is the killing of
harp and hooded

00:29:58.470 --> 00:30:02.480
seals on the Atlantic seaboard
of Canada-- Prince Edward

00:30:02.480 --> 00:30:05.120
Island, Newfoundland, Labrador.

00:30:05.120 --> 00:30:08.860
And 400,000 seals were
killed for their pelts--

00:30:08.860 --> 00:30:10.610
for fur-- not for local use.

00:30:10.610 --> 00:30:13.000
These are not
tribal communities.

00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:17.930
These are folks who are
going out, killing the seals

00:30:17.930 --> 00:30:19.750
on the ice floes,
and then shipping

00:30:19.750 --> 00:30:21.680
the pelts all over the world.

00:30:21.680 --> 00:30:23.910
So we took this on in 2005.

00:30:23.910 --> 00:30:26.820
And the white is
the quota that was

00:30:26.820 --> 00:30:33.030
set by the national wildlife
and marine authorities.

00:30:33.030 --> 00:30:39.850
They could kill 335,000, or they
could kill 330,000, 400,000.

00:30:39.850 --> 00:30:43.540
The blue is the actual kill,
because what we did is,

00:30:43.540 --> 00:30:46.150
we started closing markets
throughout the world.

00:30:46.150 --> 00:30:49.390
We got the European Union to
ban imports of seal skins.

00:30:49.390 --> 00:30:52.540
We got Mexico to ban
imports of seal skins.

00:30:52.540 --> 00:30:54.950
We've gotten China
to restrict it.

00:30:54.950 --> 00:30:59.290
So now, they have no reason
to go kill the animals,

00:30:59.290 --> 00:31:01.360
because the pelts are valueless.

00:31:01.360 --> 00:31:05.260
And this year was the smallest
seal kill in a generation,

00:31:05.260 --> 00:31:08.190
precisely because of our
work in the global economy--

00:31:08.190 --> 00:31:10.700
that millions of people
are now aware of this,

00:31:10.700 --> 00:31:12.658
and they're saying they're
not going to buy it.

00:31:12.658 --> 00:31:14.870
And politicians are
saying, we don't want it.

00:31:14.870 --> 00:31:19.740
We don't want this cruelty to
be associated with our commerce.

00:31:19.740 --> 00:31:22.300
And the use of animals
in laboratories

00:31:22.300 --> 00:31:23.920
is a very significant issue.

00:31:23.920 --> 00:31:28.160
The United States has been
the last nation in the world

00:31:28.160 --> 00:31:32.230
to allow chimpanzees to be
used in invasive experiments.

00:31:32.230 --> 00:31:33.980
We did an undercover
investigation

00:31:33.980 --> 00:31:35.880
that the largest
chimp facility, which

00:31:35.880 --> 00:31:37.640
is in Louisiana,
several years ago.

00:31:37.640 --> 00:31:39.840
And since that time,
we've been campaigning

00:31:39.840 --> 00:31:42.580
to end the use of
chimps in experiments.

00:31:42.580 --> 00:31:45.010
And we're basically
to that point

00:31:45.010 --> 00:31:48.460
now, where the head of NIH--
which two years ago made

00:31:48.460 --> 00:31:51.010
an announcement with us
that NIH is getting out

00:31:51.010 --> 00:31:54.100
of the business of using
chimps in experiments--

00:31:54.100 --> 00:31:57.650
that they're going
to ship out 400

00:31:57.650 --> 00:32:00.780
of their government-owned
chimps to sanctuaries over time,

00:32:00.780 --> 00:32:05.060
and end the invasive
experimentation on animals.

00:32:05.060 --> 00:32:08.580
So Doctor Heilig said,
"Pretty much everybody

00:32:08.580 --> 00:32:12.130
has gotten out, or is getting
out, of research with chimps."

00:32:12.130 --> 00:32:15.470
Because now we have
sophisticated ways

00:32:15.470 --> 00:32:17.880
to test medicines.

00:32:17.880 --> 00:32:22.390
We've got sophisticated
ways to test for toxicity

00:32:22.390 --> 00:32:24.430
without using a whole animal.

00:32:24.430 --> 00:32:27.890
We have organ on a chip, and
we have computational tests,

00:32:27.890 --> 00:32:30.130
and we have all sorts
of innovative ways

00:32:30.130 --> 00:32:34.740
that are cheaper, don't
involve intense animal care,

00:32:34.740 --> 00:32:37.470
and we can find out
more reliable things

00:32:37.470 --> 00:32:40.377
by doing experiments
in these ways,

00:32:40.377 --> 00:32:41.460
or research in these ways.

00:32:41.460 --> 00:32:45.340
And then the Fish and Wildlife
Service, Jane Goodall and I

00:32:45.340 --> 00:32:48.330
announced just at
the end of June

00:32:48.330 --> 00:32:52.780
that all chimpanzees, whether
they're captive or wild,

00:32:52.780 --> 00:32:54.630
they're going to be
classed as endangered.

00:32:54.630 --> 00:32:58.590
Which means that their use
in film and commercials,

00:32:58.590 --> 00:33:01.590
in the pet trade, as well
as in biomedical research,

00:33:01.590 --> 00:33:04.420
is all going to be subject to
very high levels of scrutiny

00:33:04.420 --> 00:33:09.240
now-- so a big revolution in
our relationship with chimps.

00:33:09.240 --> 00:33:15.260
And this issue of
testing on animals--

00:33:15.260 --> 00:33:17.210
for many, many
decades, we've been

00:33:17.210 --> 00:33:24.280
testing mascaras, and
lipsticks, and detergents,

00:33:24.280 --> 00:33:27.810
and other household products and
cosmetics on animals in labs.

00:33:27.810 --> 00:33:31.210
We force-feed them,
where there's a test

00:33:31.210 --> 00:33:33.810
called the lethal dose 50,
where you provide so much

00:33:33.810 --> 00:33:35.680
of a substance that
half of the control

00:33:35.680 --> 00:33:38.650
group-- if it's 50
rabbits, 25 of them

00:33:38.650 --> 00:33:43.110
die from poisoning-- half of
them, 50% is the lethal dose.

00:33:43.110 --> 00:33:45.010
Or we do the Draize
eye irri irritancy

00:33:45.010 --> 00:33:47.287
test where we dip
chemicals in their eyes.

00:33:47.287 --> 00:33:49.745
And cause-- I mean, imagine we
get a little soap in our eye

00:33:49.745 --> 00:33:51.920
and we try to rinse
it out and scrub it.

00:33:51.920 --> 00:33:55.500
These animals have no way that
they can get to their eye.

00:33:55.500 --> 00:33:58.180
They're in some
sort of stockade.

00:33:58.180 --> 00:34:00.810
And we dump this concentrated
product in their eye

00:34:00.810 --> 00:34:06.170
specifically to cause injury
to them, as a way of testing.

00:34:06.170 --> 00:34:08.699
Well, now we're down to just
about 100,000 in animals

00:34:08.699 --> 00:34:09.810
used in our country.

00:34:09.810 --> 00:34:11.350
We've got legislation
in Congress

00:34:11.350 --> 00:34:15.870
called the Humane Cosmetics Act,
to end this once and for all.

00:34:15.870 --> 00:34:19.989
And we just got Europe to
ban it in all 28 countries.

00:34:19.989 --> 00:34:22.290
And we, last year,
got India to ban it.

00:34:22.290 --> 00:34:27.370
So 1.7 billion people in the
global market now cannot even

00:34:27.370 --> 00:34:29.440
buy cosmetics tested on animals.

00:34:29.440 --> 00:34:31.850
This is going to change the
way things are happening.

00:34:31.850 --> 00:34:34.940
India banned it, as
I said, last year.

00:34:34.940 --> 00:34:39.139
And now all of these companies
as part of the growing humane

00:34:39.139 --> 00:34:41.892
economy are saying
no to animal testing.

00:34:41.892 --> 00:34:43.850
And they're marketing
their products by saying,

00:34:43.850 --> 00:34:45.840
we're not testing on animals.

00:34:45.840 --> 00:34:49.219
And this one here, Coty, you
may have heard in the news--

00:34:49.219 --> 00:34:51.239
they just bought a
whole bunch of divisions

00:34:51.239 --> 00:34:53.300
of Procter &amp; Gamble
the other day

00:34:53.300 --> 00:34:55.110
for several billion dollars.

00:34:55.110 --> 00:34:57.070
They're already a
non-animal testing company

00:34:57.070 --> 00:35:01.030
and they bought P&amp;G.
So this is the progress

00:35:01.030 --> 00:35:03.830
of the humane economy.

00:35:03.830 --> 00:35:05.631
And fur-- I mean,
there's just no excuse

00:35:05.631 --> 00:35:06.880
to kill animals for their fur.

00:35:06.880 --> 00:35:09.840
We can make synthetic coats
and natural fiber coats

00:35:09.840 --> 00:35:13.560
are just as warm and just as
stylish without causing animals

00:35:13.560 --> 00:35:17.940
to suffer in leg-hold
traps or in fur factories.

00:35:17.940 --> 00:35:19.500
There's just no point.

00:35:19.500 --> 00:35:23.050
And last week, we announced
with Hugo Boss, one

00:35:23.050 --> 00:35:27.450
of the major fashion
companies, a luxury brand,

00:35:27.450 --> 00:35:29.910
that it is completely
eliminating fur

00:35:29.910 --> 00:35:32.180
from its collections.

00:35:32.180 --> 00:35:34.700
We're negotiating with
several other luxury brands

00:35:34.700 --> 00:35:37.610
now to get past
this era of killing

00:35:37.610 --> 00:35:39.930
animals for their pelts.

00:35:39.930 --> 00:35:42.810
There's just no need.

00:35:42.810 --> 00:35:47.089
Many of these faux fur garments
are so authentic-looking that

00:35:47.089 --> 00:35:48.380
you cannot tell the difference.

00:35:48.380 --> 00:35:49.755
If you can't tell
the difference,

00:35:49.755 --> 00:35:52.440
then why would you kill
20, or 30, or 40 animals

00:35:52.440 --> 00:35:56.230
to stitch together their fur?

00:35:56.230 --> 00:35:58.637
Now all of these companies
have made commitments

00:35:58.637 --> 00:35:59.345
on the fur issue.

00:35:59.345 --> 00:36:02.020
So you can see, in all different
sectors of the economy,

00:36:02.020 --> 00:36:05.230
corporations are
now taking action.

00:36:05.230 --> 00:36:07.450
And the biggest
area, as I mentioned,

00:36:07.450 --> 00:36:10.350
is the rearing of
animals for food.

00:36:10.350 --> 00:36:14.630
We say that we love animals, yet
we're eating 9 billion of them

00:36:14.630 --> 00:36:15.900
a year.

00:36:15.900 --> 00:36:19.240
And the conditions in which
the vast majority of them

00:36:19.240 --> 00:36:23.820
are raised are so bad
that it would, and should,

00:36:23.820 --> 00:36:26.180
turn the stomach of
anyone with a conscience

00:36:26.180 --> 00:36:27.430
for other creatures.

00:36:27.430 --> 00:36:31.090
I mean, this is an image of
an industrial pig facility

00:36:31.090 --> 00:36:33.100
with sows in gestation crates.

00:36:33.100 --> 00:36:39.270
This is the standard industry
practice for the last 45 years,

00:36:39.270 --> 00:36:41.770
to keep sows in place.

00:36:41.770 --> 00:36:45.120
They have them in a two
foot by seven foot cage,

00:36:45.120 --> 00:36:48.520
where they can take one step
forward, and one step back.

00:36:48.520 --> 00:36:49.794
That's it.

00:36:49.794 --> 00:36:51.460
And they're there for
four months, which

00:36:51.460 --> 00:36:52.600
is their gestation period.

00:36:52.600 --> 00:36:55.022
They're moved to another
crate for just a short time.

00:36:55.022 --> 00:36:56.730
They're almost
immediately re-impregnated

00:36:56.730 --> 00:36:59.110
and put back in this crate.

00:36:59.110 --> 00:37:02.900
So for seven, eight, nine,
10 successive pregnancies,

00:37:02.900 --> 00:37:04.970
they're immobilized.

00:37:04.970 --> 00:37:08.780
These are sociable
herd animals that

00:37:08.780 --> 00:37:12.160
have a great nose that they use
to root around in the ground.

00:37:12.160 --> 00:37:13.440
And they want to move around.

00:37:13.440 --> 00:37:16.260
And they want to play
like other animals.

00:37:16.260 --> 00:37:19.710
And they're living on a
concrete slatted floor.

00:37:19.710 --> 00:37:22.640
And there's space in between
so the manure and the urine

00:37:22.640 --> 00:37:25.640
can fall into a
lagoon beneath them.

00:37:25.640 --> 00:37:30.100
And all that ammonia then
comes up as water evaporates.

00:37:30.100 --> 00:37:33.370
And they can't move.

00:37:33.370 --> 00:37:36.990
So I don't care if you're
a vegan, or vegetarian,

00:37:36.990 --> 00:37:38.590
or an inveterate carnivore.

00:37:38.590 --> 00:37:41.200
There's a problem with this.

00:37:41.200 --> 00:37:44.710
Wherever you are terms of
your own dietary preferences,

00:37:44.710 --> 00:37:48.470
this must stop.

00:37:48.470 --> 00:37:50.960
And we're working to stop it.

00:37:50.960 --> 00:37:55.230
This is, unfortunately, the
attitude of the major trade

00:37:55.230 --> 00:37:57.360
association with the industry.

00:37:57.360 --> 00:37:59.865
Guy said, in response
to our campaign

00:37:59.865 --> 00:38:01.450
to end the use of
the crates, he said,

00:38:01.450 --> 00:38:02.732
"So our animals can't
even turn around

00:38:02.732 --> 00:38:03.773
for two and a half years.

00:38:03.773 --> 00:38:06.550
I don't know who asked the sow
if she wanted to turn around."

00:38:06.550 --> 00:38:08.520
I mean, you can look
at these comments,

00:38:08.520 --> 00:38:10.850
and you can look
back at our history,

00:38:10.850 --> 00:38:13.940
and see how men denied women
the right to vote-- said,

00:38:13.940 --> 00:38:16.960
oh, well, they shouldn't
be able to vote.

00:38:16.960 --> 00:38:19.210
They shouldn't be
making policy decisions.

00:38:19.210 --> 00:38:21.260
The same country that
had chattel slavery,

00:38:21.260 --> 00:38:25.160
and said a whole race
or group of people

00:38:25.160 --> 00:38:30.790
should be conscripted
into forced labor--

00:38:30.790 --> 00:38:32.960
we've done some really
unpleasant things

00:38:32.960 --> 00:38:33.980
in our society.

00:38:33.980 --> 00:38:38.870
But we've always, as a society,
overcome these problems

00:38:38.870 --> 00:38:41.990
through reason, and
science, and logic,

00:38:41.990 --> 00:38:45.620
and reliance on our founding
principles in the Declaration

00:38:45.620 --> 00:38:47.240
of Independence and
the Constitution,

00:38:47.240 --> 00:38:48.680
of justice and equality.

00:38:48.680 --> 00:38:52.760
You cannot have terrible
injustice to people,

00:38:52.760 --> 00:38:54.737
and look back upon our
founding documents,

00:38:54.737 --> 00:38:55.820
and say that's consistent.

00:38:55.820 --> 00:38:59.190
Well, I don't think
we can say that we're

00:38:59.190 --> 00:39:03.560
an anti-cruelty society and
tolerate this sort of behavior.

00:39:03.560 --> 00:39:07.540
We've got to conform our
behavior with our values

00:39:07.540 --> 00:39:09.070
and our principles.

00:39:09.070 --> 00:39:11.560
There must be a realignment.

00:39:11.560 --> 00:39:14.700
And it should be happening
in agriculture as well.

00:39:14.700 --> 00:39:15.350
And it is.

00:39:15.350 --> 00:39:18.510
These are all companies
that my colleague Josh

00:39:18.510 --> 00:39:22.710
Balk has negotiated
with, and his colleagues

00:39:22.710 --> 00:39:25.390
in our Farm Animal Department--
negotiated agreements

00:39:25.390 --> 00:39:29.450
with all these companies to
phase out the purchase of pork

00:39:29.450 --> 00:39:31.430
from operations like
the one you saw,

00:39:31.430 --> 00:39:33.070
that confined the
sows in those crates.

00:39:33.070 --> 00:39:36.120
This has just happened in
the last three or four years,

00:39:36.120 --> 00:39:39.010
when McDonald's-- we announced
in a joint release with

00:39:39.010 --> 00:39:42.860
McDonald's in February
or January 2012,

00:39:42.860 --> 00:39:45.920
that they were going to phase
out the purchase of pork from

00:39:45.920 --> 00:39:47.550
operations in all
these companies--

00:39:47.550 --> 00:39:49.670
with the exception of a
couple who preceded it,

00:39:49.670 --> 00:39:51.150
like Whole Foods.

00:39:51.150 --> 00:39:53.490
This is a major revolution.

00:39:53.490 --> 00:39:56.620
And we've got to
continue to propel it.

00:39:56.620 --> 00:39:58.850
And the other area
is the treatment

00:39:58.850 --> 00:40:02.440
of the hens used for eggs.

00:40:02.440 --> 00:40:06.100
These hens are kept
in battery cages.

00:40:06.100 --> 00:40:09.280
They're small, wire cages
where six or eight birds

00:40:09.280 --> 00:40:14.610
are kept in a cage for their
entire life-- 12 or 18 months.

00:40:14.610 --> 00:40:17.890
And the amount of
space that the bird has

00:40:17.890 --> 00:40:23.710
is 67 square inches of
space-- under the industry

00:40:23.710 --> 00:40:24.610
voluntary standard.

00:40:24.610 --> 00:40:28.030
Now, there are a bunch of
egg production companies

00:40:28.030 --> 00:40:31.650
that keep birds in 48
or 54-inch allotments.

00:40:31.650 --> 00:40:35.070
But again, their standard,
their high standard

00:40:35.070 --> 00:40:36.080
is 67 square inches.

00:40:36.080 --> 00:40:38.940
Well, this is an eight and
a half by 11 sheet of paper.

00:40:38.940 --> 00:40:42.080
Eight and a half
times 11 is what?

00:40:42.080 --> 00:40:44.680
93.

00:40:44.680 --> 00:40:49.730
So 67 square inches is 2/3 the
size of this sheet of paper.

00:40:49.730 --> 00:40:54.630
This is the living space that
the hen has for the 18 months

00:40:54.630 --> 00:40:56.440
that she's alive.

00:40:56.440 --> 00:41:00.430
And she's in there with
six or seven other birds.

00:41:00.430 --> 00:41:06.490
So imagine if seven or eight
of us were in a small elevator,

00:41:06.490 --> 00:41:08.550
and we never got out.

00:41:08.550 --> 00:41:10.830
I mean, if we were in
there for 10 or 15 minutes,

00:41:10.830 --> 00:41:14.560
if that elevator gets stuck
and we're jammed in there,

00:41:14.560 --> 00:41:17.100
you better believe most of
us are going to go crazy.

00:41:17.100 --> 00:41:20.970
Imagine if you're there
for a day, or for a month,

00:41:20.970 --> 00:41:22.374
or for a year.

00:41:22.374 --> 00:41:24.540
This is what we're doing
to animals raised for food.

00:41:24.540 --> 00:41:28.142
I mean, if you came
from another planet

00:41:28.142 --> 00:41:30.350
and saw what we're doing to
these animals, you'd say,

00:41:30.350 --> 00:41:32.540
my god, this is incredible.

00:41:32.540 --> 00:41:33.480
We keep them as pets.

00:41:33.480 --> 00:41:34.979
And we treat them
as family members.

00:41:34.979 --> 00:41:37.180
Yet we're doing this to
them for food production?

00:41:39.850 --> 00:41:42.070
So California was the state
that really started this.

00:41:42.070 --> 00:41:44.320
Some of you who've been
in this state for awhile

00:41:44.320 --> 00:41:45.830
may remember this.

00:41:45.830 --> 00:41:49.920
We did a ballot measure in
2008 called Proposition 2.

00:41:49.920 --> 00:41:52.040
And this is the vote
result for Prop.

00:41:52.040 --> 00:41:53.550
2.

00:41:53.550 --> 00:41:55.170
There are 58 counties
in California.

00:41:55.170 --> 00:41:59.510
The green-shaded
counties favored Prop 2,

00:41:59.510 --> 00:42:01.540
and the red-shaded
counties opposed it.

00:42:01.540 --> 00:42:04.560
But overall, it got
63.5% of the vote

00:42:04.560 --> 00:42:06.680
to stop extreme
confinement of laying hens,

00:42:06.680 --> 00:42:08.610
breeding sows and veal calves.

00:42:08.610 --> 00:42:13.390
It got more votes than
any other initiative

00:42:13.390 --> 00:42:17.080
in American history--
for farm animals.

00:42:17.080 --> 00:42:18.960
So the public is waking up.

00:42:18.960 --> 00:42:22.140
And I'm sure if you
voted in that election--

00:42:22.140 --> 00:42:24.180
this was Obama's
first election--

00:42:24.180 --> 00:42:27.170
the presidential election was on
the same ballot-- you probably

00:42:27.170 --> 00:42:30.130
voted yes on this ballot
measure, because it made sense.

00:42:30.130 --> 00:42:31.410
Animals built to move.

00:42:31.410 --> 00:42:33.580
Should be allowed to move.

00:42:33.580 --> 00:42:37.010
Even animals raised for food
deserve humane treatment.

00:42:37.010 --> 00:42:38.210
And Prop.

00:42:38.210 --> 00:42:39.929
2 took effect January 1st.

00:42:39.929 --> 00:42:42.220
It had a six-year phase-in,
because it was so moderate,

00:42:42.220 --> 00:42:44.790
it allowed the farmer
six years to transition

00:42:44.790 --> 00:42:46.040
to more humane systems.

00:42:46.040 --> 00:42:48.550
It finally took
effect this year.

00:42:48.550 --> 00:42:52.070
And now, we've worked with all
of these companies-- really,

00:42:52.070 --> 00:42:54.460
Josh has in the
last six months--

00:42:54.460 --> 00:42:56.150
most of them have
made announcements

00:42:56.150 --> 00:42:58.530
to buy only cage-free eggs.

00:42:58.530 --> 00:43:02.770
Starbucks has made a
pledge, Burger King.

00:43:02.770 --> 00:43:06.500
We just announced Kellogg's and
General Mills, Hilton Hotels,

00:43:06.500 --> 00:43:09.255
huge food service companies
like Compass Group, and Aramark,

00:43:09.255 --> 00:43:10.860
and Sodexo.

00:43:10.860 --> 00:43:16.020
A big corporate revolution
is happening on this front.

00:43:16.020 --> 00:43:18.310
And if you shop at
Whole Foods, you'll

00:43:18.310 --> 00:43:20.690
see that Whole Foods is
providing more information

00:43:20.690 --> 00:43:22.390
to consumers about
animal products

00:43:22.390 --> 00:43:23.920
than any other company.

00:43:23.920 --> 00:43:27.050
It's using a program called
the Global Animal Partnership.

00:43:27.050 --> 00:43:28.840
You can see it here.

00:43:28.840 --> 00:43:34.350
And they certify
products on 1 to 5+.

00:43:34.350 --> 00:43:38.700
So if you look for chicken or
turkey, you can get Level 1,

00:43:38.700 --> 00:43:43.090
Step 1, Step 3, Step 5
product if they've got it in.

00:43:43.090 --> 00:43:46.964
And each of these levels
conforms to a strict set

00:43:46.964 --> 00:43:48.130
of animal welfare standards.

00:43:48.130 --> 00:43:55.240
So 1 is a more humane standard,
but it goes higher levels

00:43:55.240 --> 00:43:56.520
as the numbers go higher.

00:43:56.520 --> 00:43:58.830
So 5 is the most humane.

00:43:58.830 --> 00:44:01.140
And this is giving
consumers more information.

00:44:01.140 --> 00:44:02.960
We're hoping that
the other big food

00:44:02.960 --> 00:44:04.670
retailers adopt this system.

00:44:04.670 --> 00:44:06.510
It's not owned by Whole Foods.

00:44:06.510 --> 00:44:09.850
Whole Foods had a
role in developing it.

00:44:09.850 --> 00:44:12.960
But this is a potential
revolution in the market.

00:44:12.960 --> 00:44:16.360
And of course, the other
revolution-- by the way,

00:44:16.360 --> 00:44:20.160
Whole Foods, which is now
a $16 billion company,

00:44:20.160 --> 00:44:28.580
now is the principal GAP selling
company-- products from GAP.

00:44:28.580 --> 00:44:30.630
And already it's had an effect.

00:44:30.630 --> 00:44:32.710
I mean, each year
290 million animals,

00:44:32.710 --> 00:44:35.870
2,600 farms-- so you see
the power of corporations.

00:44:35.870 --> 00:44:38.340
When they make a
decision, it really

00:44:38.340 --> 00:44:41.740
ripples out and
has a big effect.

00:44:41.740 --> 00:44:44.470
And in the broader
sense, though, there's

00:44:44.470 --> 00:44:47.160
no way we can continue
to eat as much meat

00:44:47.160 --> 00:44:49.270
as we're doing in our society.

00:44:49.270 --> 00:44:51.000
We're eating too much.

00:44:51.000 --> 00:44:53.100
We have basically the
highest per capita meat

00:44:53.100 --> 00:44:56.620
consumption in the world,
and it's not sustainable.

00:44:56.620 --> 00:45:01.350
And Bill Gates, on
his Facebook page,

00:45:01.350 --> 00:45:02.820
was talking about this issue.

00:45:02.820 --> 00:45:05.470
And he said by 2030, the world
will need millions of tons

00:45:05.470 --> 00:45:07.037
more meat than it does today.

00:45:07.037 --> 00:45:08.870
But meeting that demand
with animal products

00:45:08.870 --> 00:45:10.200
isn't sustainable.

00:45:10.200 --> 00:45:12.490
The meat market is
ripe for reinvention.

00:45:12.490 --> 00:45:14.800
Because when you think
about, Frances Moore Lappe

00:45:14.800 --> 00:45:18.590
wrote about this 40 years ago
in "Diet for a Small Planet."

00:45:18.590 --> 00:45:21.690
Animals are protein
factories in reverse.

00:45:21.690 --> 00:45:25.222
We take a lot of
plant matter, put it

00:45:25.222 --> 00:45:27.180
into the bodies of animals,
and they convert it

00:45:27.180 --> 00:45:29.370
into a small amount
of animal protein.

00:45:29.370 --> 00:45:32.280
And the ratios are 10 or
12 or 13 pounds of grain

00:45:32.280 --> 00:45:34.920
to produce one pound of
beef, seven pounds of grain

00:45:34.920 --> 00:45:37.680
to produce one pound of
pork, three or four pounds

00:45:37.680 --> 00:45:39.270
to produce one pound of chicken.

00:45:39.270 --> 00:45:41.000
There's tremendous
waste and loss.

00:45:41.000 --> 00:45:43.040
I mean, the animals
are emitting heat.

00:45:43.040 --> 00:45:44.690
They're keeping
their organs going.

00:45:44.690 --> 00:45:46.282
They're defecating.

00:45:46.282 --> 00:45:47.490
There's all this energy loss.

00:45:47.490 --> 00:45:51.090
If we ate more plants directly,
we would much more efficiently

00:45:51.090 --> 00:45:55.397
use the food stuffs
in the world.

00:45:55.397 --> 00:45:57.230
And of course, then
there's the water issue.

00:45:57.230 --> 00:45:58.860
I mean, you could
float a battleship

00:45:58.860 --> 00:46:03.320
on what a cow needs in terms
of his or her water needs.

00:46:03.320 --> 00:46:05.930
Because again,
they're emitting heat.

00:46:05.930 --> 00:46:08.570
The body has needs for water.

00:46:08.570 --> 00:46:11.360
And they're urinating a
lot of it out as well.

00:46:11.360 --> 00:46:16.210
So west of the 20-inch rain
line in the United States,

00:46:16.210 --> 00:46:17.660
irrigation is a big thing.

00:46:17.660 --> 00:46:20.260
And I don't need to tell you
in California what you're going

00:46:20.260 --> 00:46:23.680
through on the water issue.

00:46:23.680 --> 00:46:27.590
There are companies that are now
developing plant-based proteins

00:46:27.590 --> 00:46:31.280
that replicate the taste
and texture of meat,

00:46:31.280 --> 00:46:35.350
and provide equal or,
typically, superior nutritional

00:46:35.350 --> 00:46:37.680
content-- as much
or more protein,

00:46:37.680 --> 00:46:40.690
more in the way of nutrients,
without the fat, cholesterol,

00:46:40.690 --> 00:46:44.300
hormones, other
chemicals that are now

00:46:44.300 --> 00:46:46.730
into the systems
of these animals.

00:46:46.730 --> 00:46:49.720
This is one company
called Beyond Meat.

00:46:49.720 --> 00:46:52.360
You can see its logo on
the upper right-hand side.

00:46:52.360 --> 00:46:55.020
The future of meat is
meatless-- just as tasty.

00:46:55.020 --> 00:46:59.260
So why shouldn't-- I
mean, just like fur--

00:46:59.260 --> 00:47:06.640
if you can replicate the
look of fur, the style of it,

00:47:06.640 --> 00:47:09.690
the quality, why do you
need to kill the animals?

00:47:09.690 --> 00:47:13.860
If you can develop plant-based
proteins that duplicate it,

00:47:13.860 --> 00:47:17.510
with much less in the way of
resource use, and no animal

00:47:17.510 --> 00:47:22.800
cruelty, it seems to be a
very logical argument for us.

00:47:22.800 --> 00:47:27.490
And the company that Josh
started, in its latest round,

00:47:27.490 --> 00:47:28.440
raised $90 million.

00:47:28.440 --> 00:47:34.200
I think they had $150 million
in offers for their Series C

00:47:34.200 --> 00:47:36.760
investment round--
fastest-growing food company

00:47:36.760 --> 00:47:38.710
in the world, ever.

00:47:38.710 --> 00:47:42.390
The biggest companies--
Walmart, Sodexo, Compass Group--

00:47:42.390 --> 00:47:44.390
all want this product,
because not only is it

00:47:44.390 --> 00:47:49.170
better in terms of nutrition
and equivalent in taste,

00:47:49.170 --> 00:47:50.635
it's cheaper.

00:47:50.635 --> 00:47:51.260
It makes sense.

00:47:51.260 --> 00:47:53.370
I mean, if you're putting
all that energy into animals

00:47:53.370 --> 00:47:55.320
who inefficiently convert
it to the product,

00:47:55.320 --> 00:47:57.130
when you could just
use the plants,

00:47:57.130 --> 00:48:00.410
the energetics are
obviously in favor

00:48:00.410 --> 00:48:01.730
of the more efficient use.

00:48:01.730 --> 00:48:04.160
And that should be
reflected in cost.

00:48:04.160 --> 00:48:05.220
That's what's going on.

00:48:05.220 --> 00:48:08.680
So that's why there's a
real revolution that's

00:48:08.680 --> 00:48:09.970
going on right now.

00:48:09.970 --> 00:48:12.020
And these are some of
our different campaigns--

00:48:12.020 --> 00:48:15.340
stopping extreme confinement,
ending puppy mills,

00:48:15.340 --> 00:48:18.490
dealing with horse slaughter,
protecting marine mammals,

00:48:18.490 --> 00:48:21.200
having anti-cruelty laws
throughout the world,

00:48:21.200 --> 00:48:24.140
ending the year of cosmetic
and toxicity testing

00:48:24.140 --> 00:48:26.180
on animals, and much more.

00:48:26.180 --> 00:48:29.040
So we'd love for you
guys to get involved.

00:48:29.040 --> 00:48:31.340
We're at HumaneSociety.org.

00:48:31.340 --> 00:48:33.100
We'd love for you
to become a member.

00:48:33.100 --> 00:48:36.850
We'd love for you to sign
up as a monthly donor.

00:48:36.850 --> 00:48:39.220
But most important, we
want you to get involved,

00:48:39.220 --> 00:48:41.750
because it's consumer
activism that's

00:48:41.750 --> 00:48:43.820
driving the humane economy.

00:48:43.820 --> 00:48:46.260
So thanks for listening
to my discourse.

00:48:46.260 --> 00:48:48.390
And appreciate your
being here today.

00:48:48.390 --> 00:48:49.580
Happy to take any questions.

00:48:49.580 --> 00:48:55.700
[APPLAUSE]

00:48:55.700 --> 00:49:00.730
AUDIENCE: So that the slide
that you showed with ivory

00:49:00.730 --> 00:49:03.830
had some figurines,
and that sort of thing.

00:49:03.830 --> 00:49:07.340
I'm wondering what uses of
ivory there are in the US

00:49:07.340 --> 00:49:09.890
that it's a big import for us.

00:49:09.890 --> 00:49:12.129
WAYNE PACELLE:
Yeah, the ivory is

00:49:12.129 --> 00:49:13.420
used for a variety of purposes.

00:49:13.420 --> 00:49:15.840
It used to be widely
used with pianos

00:49:15.840 --> 00:49:17.500
and other musical instruments.

00:49:17.500 --> 00:49:21.160
But Steinway, and now
Yamaha, don't use ivory.

00:49:21.160 --> 00:49:24.230
And it's mainly in
trinkets-- little carved,

00:49:24.230 --> 00:49:25.310
decorative items.

00:49:25.310 --> 00:49:28.660
And China is the
number one consumer.

00:49:28.660 --> 00:49:34.359
And the US is the
second largest consumer.

00:49:34.359 --> 00:49:36.650
We're supporting a ballot
initiative, which is actually

00:49:36.650 --> 00:49:39.990
being financed principally
by Paul Allen, the co-founder

00:49:39.990 --> 00:49:43.030
of Microsoft this November
in Washington State,

00:49:43.030 --> 00:49:46.000
to ban any sale of
ivory as well as

00:49:46.000 --> 00:49:49.010
the parts of nine other
endangered animals.

00:49:49.010 --> 00:49:52.375
We have a bill in California
to ban the ivory trade here.

00:49:52.375 --> 00:49:53.750
It's already
through one chamber.

00:49:53.750 --> 00:49:55.125
It's looking very positive.

00:49:55.125 --> 00:49:57.250
And we're working with US
Fish and Wildlife Service

00:49:57.250 --> 00:49:59.590
on a national rule on the issue.

00:49:59.590 --> 00:50:02.420
But there is kickback
from folks who

00:50:02.420 --> 00:50:05.670
are in the antiques
business, music industry,

00:50:05.670 --> 00:50:09.144
as well as the NRA, because
they want to shoot elephants,

00:50:09.144 --> 00:50:11.060
or they want their members
to be able to shoot

00:50:11.060 --> 00:50:15.130
elephants and import
the ivory into the US.

00:50:15.130 --> 00:50:18.930
So if you go to our website, and
then you go to our state page,

00:50:18.930 --> 00:50:21.590
you can find information on
the bill here in California.

00:50:21.590 --> 00:50:25.410
You can write to your
lawmakers, and get this done.

00:50:25.410 --> 00:50:28.200
And then we want Governor
Brown to sign this bill later

00:50:28.200 --> 00:50:29.630
in the year-- very important.

00:50:29.630 --> 00:50:33.090
California is the biggest
market with New York.

00:50:33.090 --> 00:50:35.240
And we did pass a bill
last year in New York

00:50:35.240 --> 00:50:37.934
to stop the trade
in ivory there.

00:50:37.934 --> 00:50:39.350
AUDIENCE: So it's
mainly trinkets?

00:50:39.350 --> 00:50:41.650
WAYNE PACELLE: Trinkets, yup.

00:50:41.650 --> 00:50:44.710
So think of these
beautiful, huge elephants

00:50:44.710 --> 00:50:47.480
being killed as trinkets.

00:50:47.480 --> 00:50:49.257
There's something
ironic about that.

00:50:49.257 --> 00:50:51.840
AUDIENCE: Why is the reason, or
maybe the reason I'm not aware

00:50:51.840 --> 00:50:58.030
of it, lobbying for controlling
the breeding of dogs,

00:50:58.030 --> 00:51:02.170
like breeders registry,
breeder control, breeding only

00:51:02.170 --> 00:51:03.150
on demand?

00:51:03.150 --> 00:51:04.620
There's many aspects of it.

00:51:04.620 --> 00:51:09.107
And also health issues
from inner breeding

00:51:09.107 --> 00:51:10.940
and unhealthy dogs, and
so on, and so forth,

00:51:10.940 --> 00:51:15.200
that creates a lot of these
rescue animals eventually, too.

00:51:15.200 --> 00:51:17.540
WAYNE PACELLE: Yeah, you
think economically there

00:51:17.540 --> 00:51:20.780
should be a cost born by
people who are breeding,

00:51:20.780 --> 00:51:24.220
because they are contributing
to a population problem

00:51:24.220 --> 00:51:26.520
that the rest of
society is dealing with.

00:51:26.520 --> 00:51:29.750
It's the reason you have
Santa Clara County Animal Care

00:51:29.750 --> 00:51:32.640
and Control spending
millions of dollars,

00:51:32.640 --> 00:51:34.994
why you have private
humane organizations caring

00:51:34.994 --> 00:51:35.910
for all these animals.

00:51:35.910 --> 00:51:39.310
If you add up the cost, it's
a couple of billion dollars

00:51:39.310 --> 00:51:41.140
a year in our society.

00:51:41.140 --> 00:51:44.400
But right now, we treat
everyone with, essentially,

00:51:44.400 --> 00:51:47.660
no tax on this behavior.

00:51:47.660 --> 00:51:53.460
There have been attempts
to have a fee for breeding.

00:51:53.460 --> 00:51:54.420
But it's been resisted.

00:51:54.420 --> 00:51:57.740
There's still, in our
country, this great tension

00:51:57.740 --> 00:52:00.630
we have between
liberty and justice.

00:52:00.630 --> 00:52:06.329
And I think that there are
folks who say, I'm responsible.

00:52:06.329 --> 00:52:07.120
I'm doing it right.

00:52:07.120 --> 00:52:08.650
I shouldn't be penalized.

00:52:08.650 --> 00:52:11.750
And that has been
a difficult thing

00:52:11.750 --> 00:52:14.770
to overcome in
state legislatures.

00:52:14.770 --> 00:52:17.280
I think what we're
trying to do is normalize

00:52:17.280 --> 00:52:20.730
the discussion about spaying and
neutering, and about adoption.

00:52:20.730 --> 00:52:23.360
And we're trying to attack,
with our Shelter Pet Project

00:52:23.360 --> 00:52:26.090
advertising campaign, which
is a national advertising

00:52:26.090 --> 00:52:30.700
campaign, the stigma associated
with animal shelter animals--

00:52:30.700 --> 00:52:32.220
that they're not
problem animals.

00:52:32.220 --> 00:52:33.930
It's usually a
human problem that

00:52:33.930 --> 00:52:36.260
resulted in the animal
being relinquished.

00:52:36.260 --> 00:52:37.520
Someone got divorced.

00:52:37.520 --> 00:52:38.140
They moved.

00:52:38.140 --> 00:52:40.390
They went to an apartment
that wouldn't allow animals.

00:52:40.390 --> 00:52:44.140
It's not the animal's fault.
The animal's not defective.

00:52:44.140 --> 00:52:47.550
So there's this notion somehow
that, while the breeder's

00:52:47.550 --> 00:52:50.527
animals are better, get one
of these puppy mill dogs,

00:52:50.527 --> 00:52:52.360
as we do all the time,
because we raid them.

00:52:52.360 --> 00:52:53.190
They're sick.

00:52:53.190 --> 00:52:54.140
They're inbred.

00:52:54.140 --> 00:52:55.510
There are all sorts of problems.

00:52:55.510 --> 00:52:58.760
The mixed breed animals are
actually much healthier,

00:52:58.760 --> 00:53:02.220
because they have a much
richer genetic diversity.

00:53:02.220 --> 00:53:05.730
And it means they've got
fewer of these chronic

00:53:05.730 --> 00:53:09.120
and hereditary
problems that plague

00:53:09.120 --> 00:53:10.520
certain breeds like bulldogs.

00:53:10.520 --> 00:53:11.770
They have this pushed-in face.

00:53:11.770 --> 00:53:13.390
They can't breathe very well.

00:53:13.390 --> 00:53:15.310
Dachshunds have
this elongated back.

00:53:15.310 --> 00:53:16.520
And they have back trouble.

00:53:16.520 --> 00:53:18.990
German shepherds
have hip problems.

00:53:18.990 --> 00:53:21.820
Almost all the breeds have
a laundry list of problems.

00:53:21.820 --> 00:53:24.310
So when you get more diversity,
and you mix the breeds,

00:53:24.310 --> 00:53:26.340
they have many fewer
health problems.

00:53:26.340 --> 00:53:29.390
Some of the large breed dogs
that can't live past seven

00:53:29.390 --> 00:53:34.890
or eight years-- I mean,
these are our creations

00:53:34.890 --> 00:53:36.180
of selective breeding.

00:53:36.180 --> 00:53:38.530
And there are lots
of physical problems

00:53:38.530 --> 00:53:41.100
that are borne by the
consumer in terms of higher

00:53:41.100 --> 00:53:43.640
veterinary cost, as well
as the emotional pain

00:53:43.640 --> 00:53:46.999
of having to see your animal
suffering or dying prematurely.

00:53:46.999 --> 00:53:48.790
AUDIENCE: It more has
to do with marketing.

00:53:48.790 --> 00:53:52.850
I found out that you're
right, but a lot of people

00:53:52.850 --> 00:53:54.600
still want a purebred.

00:53:54.600 --> 00:53:57.870
So what I found out is
that people are not aware

00:53:57.870 --> 00:54:00.190
that you can get a
purebred in rescue.

00:54:00.190 --> 00:54:02.320
And there's many,
many purebred rescues.

00:54:02.320 --> 00:54:05.385
And they have this notion
that all dogs in rescue

00:54:05.385 --> 00:54:09.040
are mixed dogs, it's mainly
pit bulls, and so on.

00:54:09.040 --> 00:54:11.775
And they never go to
even-- they don't know.

00:54:11.775 --> 00:54:12.650
They just don't know.

00:54:12.650 --> 00:54:14.960
They go and pay $2,000
for a purebred dog,

00:54:14.960 --> 00:54:18.040
and they don't know they could
have got one from a rescue.

00:54:18.040 --> 00:54:20.540
WAYNE PACELLE: That's one of
the many reasons why I want you

00:54:20.540 --> 00:54:21.920
to read my new book coming out.

00:54:21.920 --> 00:54:25.240
Because petfinder.com is part
of this humane revolution.

00:54:25.240 --> 00:54:28.830
Petfinder.com loads
pictures and information

00:54:28.830 --> 00:54:32.200
about available dogs and
cats, homeless dogs and cats.

00:54:32.200 --> 00:54:33.700
You can get any
kind of dog that you

00:54:33.700 --> 00:54:35.150
want by searching the website.

00:54:35.150 --> 00:54:37.250
If you go to a physical
brick and mortar shelter,

00:54:37.250 --> 00:54:38.791
you may not find
the animal you want,

00:54:38.791 --> 00:54:42.840
even though one third of them
are purebreds in shelters.

00:54:42.840 --> 00:54:43.900
But now you can find one.

00:54:43.900 --> 00:54:46.394
President Obama wanted
a Portuguese water dog.

00:54:46.394 --> 00:54:48.810
He could've gone on petfinder
and found a Portuguese water

00:54:48.810 --> 00:54:48.930
dog.

00:54:48.930 --> 00:54:50.346
You don't need to
go to a breeder.

00:54:50.346 --> 00:54:54.540
You can get any kind of dog that
you want through this channel.

00:54:54.540 --> 00:54:56.500
So you're right.

00:54:56.500 --> 00:54:58.000
AUDIENCE: Speaking
of pit bulls, I'm

00:54:58.000 --> 00:55:00.860
wondering if you could
speak to any work that's

00:55:00.860 --> 00:55:05.120
being done about changing their
very unfortunate and undeserved

00:55:05.120 --> 00:55:06.955
reputation in shelters?

00:55:06.955 --> 00:55:09.010
WAYNE PACELLE:
Yeah, well, pitbulls

00:55:09.010 --> 00:55:11.060
are really not even a breed.

00:55:11.060 --> 00:55:12.784
We call them pit bull-type dogs.

00:55:12.784 --> 00:55:15.200
There are different kinds of
dogs-- American Staffordshire

00:55:15.200 --> 00:55:16.320
terrier and others.

00:55:16.320 --> 00:55:23.460
And they definitely have
been the victims of stigma.

00:55:23.460 --> 00:55:26.930
If you look back
historically in our culture,

00:55:26.930 --> 00:55:28.790
there were different
dogs who were

00:55:28.790 --> 00:55:32.650
viewed as the most menacing
and aggressive over time.

00:55:32.650 --> 00:55:35.510
In the post-slavery
era, bloodhounds

00:55:35.510 --> 00:55:38.100
were viewed as the
most vicious dogs.

00:55:38.100 --> 00:55:41.620
You can see pictures of
them, and their depictions

00:55:41.620 --> 00:55:44.360
in popular culture and in art.

00:55:44.360 --> 00:55:45.990
They were the vicious ones.

00:55:45.990 --> 00:55:49.900
They were chasing slaves,
and trying to get them back.

00:55:49.900 --> 00:55:54.050
When I was a kid, it
was Doberman Pinschers.

00:55:54.050 --> 00:55:57.400
There was also, before that,
it was German shepherds.

00:55:57.400 --> 00:56:00.540
There was a real craze with
Rottweilers for awhile.

00:56:00.540 --> 00:56:02.440
So pit bulls have
been kind of dominant

00:56:02.440 --> 00:56:06.410
as the badass dog for
the last 20 or 25 years.

00:56:06.410 --> 00:56:09.660
And some of it-- I went
to a fascinating lecture

00:56:09.660 --> 00:56:13.750
from a guy who works with
the Canine Research Center.

00:56:13.750 --> 00:56:17.920
And you can see these
popular media caricatures

00:56:17.920 --> 00:56:20.520
of the dogs that
have really driven

00:56:20.520 --> 00:56:23.140
this phony impression of them.

00:56:23.140 --> 00:56:27.370
And I don't know if any of you
remember the "Little Rascals,"

00:56:27.370 --> 00:56:30.270
but Petey, the dog, was
a pit bull-type dog.

00:56:30.270 --> 00:56:34.070
They were the great
American dog at one point.

00:56:34.070 --> 00:56:38.020
There is a circumstance
where some people, who

00:56:38.020 --> 00:56:41.680
are not well-behaved
themselves, get these dogs.

00:56:41.680 --> 00:56:44.380
And then they color the
behavior of the dogs.

00:56:44.380 --> 00:56:47.750
And it's because of
that sort of morphing

00:56:47.750 --> 00:56:51.060
of the dog based
on human behavior

00:56:51.060 --> 00:56:52.960
that this reputation develops.

00:56:52.960 --> 00:56:57.560
They are the most commonly
used dogs in fighting rings.

00:56:57.560 --> 00:57:00.230
But they were specifically
bred and trained

00:57:00.230 --> 00:57:02.340
not to attack the
people, because they're

00:57:02.340 --> 00:57:04.800
in with their handlers
when they're fighting.

00:57:04.800 --> 00:57:10.740
And they were bred and
trained to attack other dogs,

00:57:10.740 --> 00:57:12.150
but not to attack people.

00:57:12.150 --> 00:57:14.840
So there are lots of
convoluted parts of this.

00:57:14.840 --> 00:57:18.100
The chairman of our board
is a big pit bull enthusiast

00:57:18.100 --> 00:57:21.230
and he sleeps with three
in his bed every night.

00:57:21.230 --> 00:57:23.850
And we have a dogs in the office
policy at the Humane Society.

00:57:23.850 --> 00:57:26.720
I know you do at Google, as
well, which is fantastic.

00:57:26.720 --> 00:57:29.210
We wrote a book about
there's dogs in the office,

00:57:29.210 --> 00:57:31.950
and invoked Google's own policy.

00:57:31.950 --> 00:57:33.760
And the dogs are
so well behaved.

00:57:33.760 --> 00:57:38.070
And it's just a question
of properly raising them.

00:57:38.070 --> 00:57:40.310
AUDIENCE: I wanted to
ask you specifically

00:57:40.310 --> 00:57:44.380
about an issue happening right
now around the New York Blood

00:57:44.380 --> 00:57:45.610
Center.

00:57:45.610 --> 00:57:47.970
I know you wrote a letter
to the New York Blood Center

00:57:47.970 --> 00:57:49.560
a few months ago.

00:57:49.560 --> 00:57:52.850
And for those of
you who don't know,

00:57:52.850 --> 00:57:56.190
maybe you can speak to it
more eloquently than I.

00:57:56.190 --> 00:58:00.200
But there was a chimpanzee
colony in Liberia

00:58:00.200 --> 00:58:02.040
that's been used for
biomedical research

00:58:02.040 --> 00:58:04.840
by the New York Blood
Center for decades.

00:58:04.840 --> 00:58:08.680
And New York Blood Center has
recently essentially abandoned

00:58:08.680 --> 00:58:13.090
them, and ceased all
funding for their care.

00:58:13.090 --> 00:58:16.200
So the specific
question I have is,

00:58:16.200 --> 00:58:21.410
what can people like
myself do to encourage

00:58:21.410 --> 00:58:24.540
non-profit organizations
or corporations that

00:58:24.540 --> 00:58:33.730
have $100s of millions in
funding to do the moral thing,

00:58:33.730 --> 00:58:35.864
and meet their commitments?

00:58:35.864 --> 00:58:38.030
WAYNE PACELLE: Well, you
articulated that very well.

00:58:38.030 --> 00:58:39.366
Thank you for doing that.

00:58:39.366 --> 00:58:40.490
Thank you for following it.

00:58:40.490 --> 00:58:43.350
I mean, this is a case of
someone creating a problem,

00:58:43.350 --> 00:58:46.210
and passing the cost
on to someone else.

00:58:46.210 --> 00:58:47.900
So after the New
York Blood Center,

00:58:47.900 --> 00:58:51.740
which is a large charity-- a
public health-oriented charity

00:58:51.740 --> 00:58:55.280
that obviously does
blood-oriented work,

00:58:55.280 --> 00:58:58.670
important work-- they had
used chimps in research,

00:58:58.670 --> 00:59:02.230
stopped using them, had this
colony of them in Liberia,

00:59:02.230 --> 00:59:06.330
was supporting them to
maintain their health

00:59:06.330 --> 00:59:09.300
and well being, as they had
pledged to do a number of years

00:59:09.300 --> 00:59:10.280
ago.

00:59:10.280 --> 00:59:12.685
Again, if you use
a chimpanzee-- this

00:59:12.685 --> 00:59:15.190
is what happens in film
as well, or commercials.

00:59:15.190 --> 00:59:19.535
Here you see these cute infant
or juvenile chimpanzees.

00:59:19.535 --> 00:59:21.410
When they get to be
seven or eight years old,

00:59:21.410 --> 00:59:23.010
they become too
powerful to maintain.

00:59:23.010 --> 00:59:24.910
They can't be used on set.

00:59:24.910 --> 00:59:26.650
They live for 60 years,
so they dump them

00:59:26.650 --> 00:59:29.860
onto us and other animal welfare
groups and chimp protection

00:59:29.860 --> 00:59:30.360
groups.

00:59:30.360 --> 00:59:32.170
We have to care for
them another 50 years.

00:59:32.170 --> 00:59:35.760
We're talking about it
costs, on average, $17,000

00:59:35.760 --> 00:59:37.820
to care for a chimp every year.

00:59:37.820 --> 00:59:40.090
Look at that times 50 years.

00:59:40.090 --> 00:59:42.510
It's approaching
$1 million dollars.

00:59:42.510 --> 00:59:46.050
So where does
responsibility come in?

00:59:46.050 --> 00:59:48.240
That kind of goes
to your question.

00:59:48.240 --> 00:59:51.400
People create the problem, then
they dump it on the rest of us?

00:59:51.400 --> 00:59:55.220
We need a fuller accounting of
what's going on in our society.

00:59:55.220 --> 00:59:57.990
We need a fuller accounting
of factory farming.

00:59:57.990 --> 01:00:00.159
I mean, we think
of this cheap meat,

01:00:00.159 --> 01:00:01.700
where we have all
these public health

01:00:01.700 --> 01:00:04.260
costs that are transferred
to society in terms

01:00:04.260 --> 01:00:06.770
of heart disease and obesity.

01:00:06.770 --> 01:00:09.450
We have public health risks in
terms of antibiotic resistant

01:00:09.450 --> 01:00:12.434
bacteria, because we're dosing
these animals with antibiotics.

01:00:12.434 --> 01:00:14.850
They're dumping their manure
in our streams and our lakes,

01:00:14.850 --> 01:00:17.550
and they're poisoning
fish, and diminishing

01:00:17.550 --> 01:00:24.840
the recreational qualities of
these water areas-- on and on.

01:00:24.840 --> 01:00:26.920
So the New York Blood
Center as a charity

01:00:26.920 --> 01:00:29.220
just completely
dropped the ball.

01:00:29.220 --> 01:00:30.619
And we're picking up the slack.

01:00:30.619 --> 01:00:31.660
But we shouldn't have to.

01:00:31.660 --> 01:00:34.300
I'd say keep tabs
on our website.

01:00:34.300 --> 01:00:36.890
We're urging people to
write to the Blood Center,

01:00:36.890 --> 01:00:38.122
hold them accountable.

01:00:38.122 --> 01:00:39.830
And I can assure you
that we're not going

01:00:39.830 --> 01:00:41.760
to let them get away with it.

01:00:41.760 --> 01:00:44.260
We're going to
stick with the plan.

01:00:44.260 --> 01:00:45.450
Thank you.

01:00:45.450 --> 01:00:47.825
AUDIENCE: I had a question
about how you guys are working

01:00:47.825 --> 01:00:51.730
with veterinarians, specifically
for live animal veterinarians,

01:00:51.730 --> 01:00:54.430
and also food animal vets.

01:00:54.430 --> 01:00:56.620
WAYNE PACELLE: Well,
we have a division

01:00:56.620 --> 01:00:59.300
called the Humane Society
Veterinary Medical Association.

01:00:59.300 --> 01:01:03.120
So we have about 7,000 vets,
or about 70,000 to 80,000 vets

01:01:03.120 --> 01:01:04.252
in the US.

01:01:04.252 --> 01:01:05.710
Most of them are
small animal vets,

01:01:05.710 --> 01:01:07.450
but there are
categories of them.

01:01:07.450 --> 01:01:11.050
There are farm animal vets,
lab animal vets, equine vets.

01:01:11.050 --> 01:01:14.140
And we're trying to get
vets in a bigger leadership

01:01:14.140 --> 01:01:15.840
position in animal protection.

01:01:15.840 --> 01:01:18.900
Most vets historically worked
for the industries that

01:01:18.900 --> 01:01:20.250
were causing harm to animals.

01:01:20.250 --> 01:01:23.330
And they then internalized,
and then externalized

01:01:23.330 --> 01:01:24.870
their value system.

01:01:24.870 --> 01:01:26.600
And they were part
of the problem.

01:01:26.600 --> 01:01:33.960
Now, with women now dominating
veterinary school slots--

01:01:33.960 --> 01:01:37.030
it used to be 90/10 male
to female in vet schools.

01:01:37.030 --> 01:01:39.610
Now it's 90/10 females.

01:01:39.610 --> 01:01:42.459
And with small animal
vets caring for pets,

01:01:42.459 --> 01:01:44.000
not associated with
these industries,

01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:46.461
there's a big revolution
happening in the vet field.

01:01:46.461 --> 01:01:47.460
We want to encourage it.

01:01:47.460 --> 01:01:49.709
And that's why we've got the
Humane Society Veterinary

01:01:49.709 --> 01:01:52.550
Medical Association working.

01:01:52.550 --> 01:01:54.080
So thank you all very much.

01:01:54.080 --> 01:01:55.130
Thanks for having me.

01:01:55.130 --> 01:01:58.490
Thanks, everyone, for taking
time from your work day.

01:01:58.490 --> 01:01:59.090
Thank you.

01:01:59.090 --> 01:02:00.640
[APPLAUSE]
