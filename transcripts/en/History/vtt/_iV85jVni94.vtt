00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:01.250
[blade drawn]

00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:07.750
This is the weapons tests.

00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:09.290
There will be a strength
test, a sharpness test.

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:11.670
And up first, the kill test.

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:12.710
Doug?

00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:13.500
Jason, you're up first.

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:14.250
You ready?

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:15.080
Yes, sir.

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:16.080
[dramatic music]

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:17.460
[thwack]

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:18.710
[thwack]

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:19.960
[slicing sound]

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:23.960
[slicing sound]

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:26.710
[slicing sound]

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:28.080
[exhales heavily]

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:29.960
[dramatic music]

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:35.580
That was the coolest
thing I've ever seen.

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:36.670
All right, Jason.

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:38.170
This weapon is fast.

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:39.670
It's maneuverable.

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:41.960
Your tip here is sharp enough
to penetrate and lacerate

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:43.540
on the way out.

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:46.880
The only one issue here is
that it did pick up a bend.

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:49.960
But, overall, your
weapon, sir, will kill.

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:51.580
Thank you.

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:53.080
All right, Spicy
Mike, you ready?

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:53.830
[laughs] Let's do it.

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:54.580
Let's do this.

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:57.000
[dramatic music]

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.080
[thwack]

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:01.420
[heavy metal music]

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:05.040
[slicing sound]

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:07.120
[thwack]

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:08.750
[heavy metal music]

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:09.710
[slicing sound]

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:11.080
[laughs]

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:12.290
[slicing sound]

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:17.880
[dramatic music]

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:20.120
[thud]
- [laughs]

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.880
That's awesome!

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:22.040
[dramatic music]

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:25.750
Did I do that?

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:28.500
Spicy Mike, your
[inaudible],, it's

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:31.210
wide enough to break bone as
I was thrusting into the chest

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:32.120
cavity.

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:34.620
It's a light, fast weapon.

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:37.080
And, most importantly,
it will kill.

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:38.880
Thank you.

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:40.170
All right, gentlemen.

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:41.790
Now it's my turn,
the strength test.

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:44.920
Now, remember, this test is
not about what your blades can

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:48.500
do to the target, but what these
targets can do to your blades.

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:49.670
All right, Jason, you're up.
You read?

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.880
Yes, sir.

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:50.880
OK.

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:51.880
[dramatic music]

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:54.580
[heavy metal music]

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:56.790
[clattering]

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:02.170
[thwack]

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:04.500
[thwack]

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:05.500
[thwack]

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:07.330
[heavy metal music]

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:10.040
[dramatic music]

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:11.420
All right, Jason.

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:14.120
Well, this has got some
serious heft to it.

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:16.120
That bend didn't change any.

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:17.500
What I do like to
see is the fact

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:19.920
that your edges are just fine.

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:21.420
It's a strong weapon.

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:23.120
Definitely did what
it's supposed to do.

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:24.000
So good job.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:25.210
Thank you.

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:26.710
All right, Michael.
You ready?

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:27.460
Yeah.

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:28.420
[dramatic music]

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:31.710
[clattering]

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:33.290
[heavy metal music]

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:36.040
[clattering]

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:37.540
[thwack]

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:39.330
[thwack]

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:41.290
[thwack]

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:46.960
Awesome.

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:48.290
All right.

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:50.830
Well, your weapon is
still in one piece.

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:52.460
It's still sharp.

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:53.750
You didn't lose any
of that blade at all.

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:55.080
It's well done.
A good weapon.

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:56.500
Thank you.

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:58.830
Bladesmiths, this
is the sharpest test,

00:02:58.830 --> 00:02:59.960
the banner raise.

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:01.420
Jason, you're up first.
You ready?

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:02.170
Yes, sir.

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:04.750
Let's do this.

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:06.330
[heavy metal music]

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:10.380
[fabric cutting]

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:27.170
That was neat.

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:29.040
Your crescent
blade is very sharp.

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:30.380
It cut cleanly through the rope.

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:31.580
One and done.

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:33.540
The edges of your
flamberge are sharp.

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:37.170
The tip easily pierced it
and sliced all the way down.

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:41.290
Overall, sir, your
weapon will cut.

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:42.790
All right, Michael, your turn.
You ready?

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:43.830
Let's do it.

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:46.710
Let's do this.

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:48.290
[heavy metal music]

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:52.460
[fabric cutting]

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:06.120
All right, Mike, on
your crescent blade,

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:07.710
the edge is sharp.

00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:10.000
Your flamberge over
here, the point is sharp,

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:10.960
the edges are sharp.

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:13.710
It was very easy to slide down.

00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:18.380
Overall, sir, your
weapon will cut.

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:20.460
Jason, Michael,
you guys brought us

00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:22.290
exactly what we asked for.

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:24.790
But, unfortunately, there can
only be one "Forged in Fire"

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:26.080
champion.

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:28.250
Spicy Mike, congratulations.

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:29.920
You are our new "Forged
in Fire" champion,

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:33.290
and that is a title that comes
with a check for $10,000.

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:34.880
Good job, man.

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:37.880
Oh, this is like the
proudest moment my entire life.

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:39.170
Well, congratulations, man.

00:04:39.170 --> 00:04:40.580
You did some fantastic work.

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:44.170
Please present your
blade to our judges.

00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:45.670
I won!

00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:47.420
I'm this crazy guy
with a weird nickname

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:48.330
from the middle of nowhere.

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:51.330
But I did it!
