00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.660
LUKE: Some of these have to
do with data quality.

00:00:01.660 --> 00:00:03.640
Is that OK just to go ahead
and ask those now?

00:00:03.640 --> 00:00:04.120
DANIEL: Yeah.

00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:04.560
LUKE: OK.

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:06.900
Well, you said too short
description, you don't want to

00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:09.910
tell us how short a too
short description is?

00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:13.190
Is that right?

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:15.280
DANIEL: Maybe these guys can
address it better than I can,

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:18.710
but there's a suggested length
for the description.

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:22.140
I think it's 250 or maybe
500 characters.

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:24.620
And I think descriptions less
than that length will be

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:33.240
accepted sometimes, but
too short, it's not a

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:34.810
well defined notion.

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:42.330
It's something that our parser
and validation methods will

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:45.180
actually determine on their
own whether it's too short

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:47.420
not, whether you're doing a good
enough job describing it.

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:49.720
But again, I probably can't
speak to that as

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:50.430
well as these guys.

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:53.240
Do you guys have anything
to add?

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:55.786
CHRIS: I mean, I agree
with what you said.

00:00:55.786 --> 00:00:57.992
I think too short description
is definitely a

00:00:57.992 --> 00:00:59.072
recommendation.

00:00:59.072 --> 00:01:01.950
You obviously don't want people
to-- the reason that

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:04.621
it's not a hard and fast rule is
that [UNINTELLIGIBLE] want

00:01:04.621 --> 00:01:07.400
to encourage people to put stuff
in there that is not

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:09.340
actually relevant
to the product.

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:13.670
So it's really just a way to
say, hey, we believe that your

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:16.670
best descriptions, long
descriptions, are a benefit to

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:18.300
users when they're looking
at a product or

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:19.428
searching for a product.

00:01:19.428 --> 00:01:20.384
[UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:01:20.384 --> 00:01:23.780
the product is.

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:27.141
There is no specific hard and
fast line, where we'd say this

00:01:27.141 --> 00:01:31.355
is too short and it's
[UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:01:31.355 --> 00:01:34.970
It's more, again, just trying
to make the merchant

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:37.405
understand that the better
descriptions they give, the

00:01:37.405 --> 00:01:39.505
better they can understand that
data and make it more

00:01:39.505 --> 00:01:40.880
relevant to users.

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:43.090
LUKE: I'm just asking because
I want to validate, right.

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:45.400
So it's easy for me just to have
some sort of minimum and

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:48.720
I can just say, it's less than
250, that they need to supply

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:49.970
more information.

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:56.050
CHRIS: Yeah, so for that, I'd
say that's right what you just

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:58.580
said there.

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:59.150
Try to make it.

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:05.210
But again, we really don't
want just a bunch of

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:07.210
[UNINTELLIGIBLE] data thrown
in just for the sake of

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:09.940
throwing in unnecessary data.

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:12.220
DANIEL: So if they can make
the 250, that's great.

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:15.394
If not, got to take it on
a case by case basis.

00:02:15.394 --> 00:02:15.841
LUKE: OK.

00:02:15.841 --> 00:02:17.470
Should I go to number two?

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:18.570
DANIEL: Sure, and
then we can--

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:19.510
LUKE: So, [? with is draft, ?]

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:23.930
I thought in the old days, if
you uploaded is draft true, it

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:27.050
would load a deactivated
product.

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:28.100
DANIEL: So this API--

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:29.940
maybe you're talking
about base API--

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:33.450
this API has only been around
since December of 2010.

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:36.070
So it's barely over
a year old.

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:39.140
I've only been on the team
since August of 2011.

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:41.730
I've never ever come across--

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:47.280
so is draft in the .net library
corresponds to the app

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:51.860
draft element from the
app XML namespace.

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:54.150
And that, as far as I know,
has never been a

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:55.850
part of this API.

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:58.780
So you can send it, we'll parse
it and return it, but we

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:00.390
don't do anything with it.

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:02.890
You want to use availability
for that.

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:06.950
And availability is actually one
of the required elements.

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:09.310
LUKE: Just so you know, it is
in the .net Client library.

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:11.600
So I can--

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:16.280
DANIEL: It is because when you
write software for so many

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:20.720
different things that share
namespaces and share different

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:26.380
utilities, we want to write as
little duplicate code as

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:27.130
possible, right.

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:31.220
So that's in one of the parent
classes, but it isn't

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:32.370
necessary for you to use.

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:35.440
There are some other things in
those parent classes that use

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:39.020
part of the app namespace or the
batch namespace, or parts

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:41.090
we just don't use
for this API.

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:43.570
LUKE: So if I load something
as available out of stock,

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:46.700
will it load deactivated, and
then it will not go to review

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:48.770
immediately?

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:50.150
DANIEL: I'm not 100%
sure on that.

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:52.870
Do you guys know,
Chris or Raf?

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:57.440
Does out of stock make
it deactivated?

00:03:57.440 --> 00:03:59.010
CHRIS: I'm not 100%
sure either.

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:01.380
DANIEL: So I don't think out
of stock deactivates it.

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:04.300
If you set an expiration date
that's already occurred,

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:05.190
that'll deactivate it.

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:06.910
LUKE: Ah, thank you.

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:10.990
DANIEL: Obviously if you send a
delete, that will delete it.

00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:14.680
But if you want to keep certain
things around like

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:18.149
ranking and stuff like that, I
don't know exactly how that

00:04:18.149 --> 00:04:19.649
works but I do know
they're different.

00:04:19.649 --> 00:04:24.450
I can get a more detailed
answer for you on that.

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:28.040
I'm not entirely sure what
out of stock does.

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:31.840
Let's hear the full details
of Andrew's question now.

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:35.180
So Andrew, the guys on my far
left, I don't know if they're

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:38.520
on your left, are Chris and Raf,
they're here with ops.

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:42.060
Chris deals mostly with data
quality and things of that

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:45.530
sort in the US, and
Raf is in EMEA.

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:49.930
So hopefully these guys will be
able to be on point and get

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:50.980
exactly what you need.

00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:52.380
So let's hear it.

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:53.550
ANDREW: Hi.

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:55.130
Can you hear me?

00:04:55.130 --> 00:04:55.790
Oh good.

00:04:55.790 --> 00:05:00.210
Sorry, this is my first try
with this hangout thing.

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:06.800
The questions I have are about
best practices for

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:11.650
international sites, languages,
things like that.

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:13.080
We have--

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:18.370
Zazzle, which is the company I
work for, has sites around the

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:21.990
world and lots of different
levels of quality of content

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:25.060
for those sites.

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:27.760
So for example, we have
a lot of really good

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:29.740
English content in Canada.

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:34.490
We have some really good French
content in Canada.

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:37.280
I know that the shopping
API doesn't place any

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:40.960
limitations on what--

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:43.180
there's not an explicit
limitation on what languages

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:45.710
you can send to what countries,
but I'm wondering

00:05:45.710 --> 00:05:50.050
if there's something in the back
end that stops that, or

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:53.460
if there's a best practices,
or should we not ever send

00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:56.180
English to Japan.

00:05:56.180 --> 00:05:59.210
What do you guys think
about all that?

00:05:59.210 --> 00:06:03.390
CHRIS: So we do have rules
for each country on which

00:06:03.390 --> 00:06:05.350
languages are supported.

00:06:05.350 --> 00:06:08.324
So for Japan, it would
be Japanese.

00:06:08.324 --> 00:06:13.520
We wouldn't have the English
language item in Japan.

00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:15.500
ANDREW: That will just be
stopped by the API, or that

00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:19.136
will get rejected,
or what's the--

00:06:19.136 --> 00:06:23.088
CHRIS: I don't know if it will
stop it or reject it.

00:06:23.088 --> 00:06:24.410
Daniel, I don't know--

00:06:24.410 --> 00:06:25.650
DANIEL: I don't know off the top
of my head, but I can find

00:06:25.650 --> 00:06:27.100
out for you.

00:06:27.100 --> 00:06:30.183
CHRIS: But it may be something
that gets flagged during

00:06:30.183 --> 00:06:33.260
[UNINTELLIGIBLE] some of
the content into the

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:35.600
[UNINTELLIGIBLE] index it.

00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:36.455
We're actually--

00:06:36.455 --> 00:06:40.660
we're all focused on
this right now.

00:06:40.660 --> 00:06:45.645
So in EMEA we are seeing people,
committees serving

00:06:45.645 --> 00:06:47.290
through UK.

00:06:47.290 --> 00:06:51.955
And we know that this is not
a great user experience if

00:06:51.955 --> 00:06:54.942
you're out here searching
athletic shopping UK, you

00:06:54.942 --> 00:06:58.090
probably don't want to
[UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:06:58.090 --> 00:07:00.710
ANDREW: Well, I mean presumably
Google knows what

00:07:00.710 --> 00:07:04.140
language you're interested in
when you're doing the search.

00:07:04.140 --> 00:07:07.740
So as long as you set the right
language, it seems like

00:07:07.740 --> 00:07:09.460
that would be OK.

00:07:09.460 --> 00:07:12.045
Google would just filter it out
for the people who they

00:07:12.045 --> 00:07:13.673
don't think speak German.

00:07:13.673 --> 00:07:16.890
CHRIS: Yeah, so unfortunately,
it's not that sophisticated.

00:07:16.890 --> 00:07:20.975
So if you target a specific
country like [UNINTELLIGIBLE],

00:07:20.975 --> 00:07:22.720
it will show in that picture.

00:07:22.720 --> 00:07:23.620
ANDREW: OK.

00:07:23.620 --> 00:07:26.060
CHRIS: So what we're doing
now, is the focus is on

00:07:26.060 --> 00:07:27.310
inventing [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:07:29.310 --> 00:07:29.982
UK.

00:07:29.982 --> 00:07:30.595
[UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:07:30.595 --> 00:07:34.425
look over something that's in
a language that is not in

00:07:34.425 --> 00:07:36.900
English [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:07:36.900 --> 00:07:37.500
in the UK.

00:07:37.500 --> 00:07:40.250
So when you're submitting the
content, you have the API, are

00:07:40.250 --> 00:07:42.810
you actually supplying the
language that it is?

00:07:42.810 --> 00:07:43.600
ANDREW: Yeah.

00:07:43.600 --> 00:07:45.590
I mean, right now we're not.

00:07:45.590 --> 00:07:46.960
That's why--

00:07:46.960 --> 00:07:49.810
we specify the language, but
we're only sending one

00:07:49.810 --> 00:07:52.070
language to each country, which
means that we miss out

00:07:52.070 --> 00:07:56.800
on Canadian French and most
of our purchases in the

00:07:56.800 --> 00:08:00.510
Netherlands, weirdly not
in Dutch, in English.

00:08:00.510 --> 00:08:07.310
So it's unclear to me whether
I could provide a better

00:08:07.310 --> 00:08:12.590
experience to people in NL by
submitting both some Dutch

00:08:12.590 --> 00:08:15.750
products and some English
products, as long as I flag

00:08:15.750 --> 00:08:18.680
them with the right language,
which is part of the content

00:08:18.680 --> 00:08:20.260
for shopping API.

00:08:20.260 --> 00:08:22.240
You have to specify
the language.

00:08:22.240 --> 00:08:24.640
CHRIS: So I think there's
two things here.

00:08:24.640 --> 00:08:28.990
It's my understanding, and
maybe [UNINTELLIGIBLE] or

00:08:28.990 --> 00:08:31.771
Daniel or I can look into
this, but I have a

00:08:31.771 --> 00:08:32.270
clue to make it.

00:08:32.270 --> 00:08:35.175
You set the language
to English.

00:08:35.175 --> 00:08:36.425
[INAUDIBLE]

00:08:38.210 --> 00:08:42.200
You'll see that's not something
that should be

00:08:42.200 --> 00:08:43.789
indexed or that's not something
that should be

00:08:43.789 --> 00:08:45.470
returned for search queries
on that property.

00:08:45.470 --> 00:08:47.770
And so it just wouldn't
appear.

00:08:47.770 --> 00:08:54.650
And then if you're to set the
language to the [INAUDIBLE]

00:08:54.650 --> 00:08:56.700
that language [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:08:56.700 --> 00:08:58.430
ANDREW: Right, right,
obviously.

00:08:58.430 --> 00:09:06.070
CHRIS: So I'm not up to speed on
exactly what our plans are

00:09:06.070 --> 00:09:07.640
for supporting multiple
languages

00:09:07.640 --> 00:09:08.340
in different markets.

00:09:08.340 --> 00:09:10.988
But as far as I know, we're not
currently [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:09:10.988 --> 00:09:11.884
market right now.

00:09:11.884 --> 00:09:14.280
For example, we're not even
launched in Canada.

00:09:14.280 --> 00:09:17.407
So I'm imagining you're
submitting for product listing

00:09:17.407 --> 00:09:18.920
ads in Canada.

00:09:18.920 --> 00:09:23.940
ANDREW: Yeah and Google
Affiliate Network.

00:09:23.940 --> 00:09:26.610
Actually there's another one
too, but they're all through

00:09:26.610 --> 00:09:28.570
the same API.

00:09:28.570 --> 00:09:31.340
CHRIS: So actually there it
starts to get a little bit

00:09:31.340 --> 00:09:33.410
more complex when you take
apart the listing

00:09:33.410 --> 00:09:35.800
ads into the questions.

00:09:35.800 --> 00:09:39.750
So then it's also how they want
to display this and how

00:09:39.750 --> 00:09:40.930
that is useful to them.

00:09:40.930 --> 00:09:45.070
So it's possible if you were
to submit to country Canada

00:09:45.070 --> 00:09:48.150
language French, that even
a product search

00:09:48.150 --> 00:09:48.720
wouldn't show it.

00:09:48.720 --> 00:09:50.700
[UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:09:50.700 --> 00:09:52.542
would not launch there.

00:09:52.542 --> 00:09:55.950
But it's possible
[UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:09:55.950 --> 00:09:58.997
And whether the affiliate
network might be a little bit

00:09:58.997 --> 00:09:59.440
useful for that.

00:09:59.440 --> 00:10:03.270
So that's also [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:10:03.270 --> 00:10:04.325
follow up on.

00:10:04.325 --> 00:10:10.290
If they have any use
for content that's

00:10:10.290 --> 00:10:12.170
submitted that way.

00:10:12.170 --> 00:10:12.580
ANDREW: OK.

00:10:12.580 --> 00:10:13.631
Well that's--

00:10:13.631 --> 00:10:15.740
CHRIS: Does that make sense?

00:10:15.740 --> 00:10:16.010
ANDREW: Yeah.

00:10:16.010 --> 00:10:20.330
I didn't realize you guys hadn't
started to surface

00:10:20.330 --> 00:10:22.910
things by language from
Google product.

00:10:22.910 --> 00:10:26.270
I kind of went on Google and I
worked with one of our Dutch

00:10:26.270 --> 00:10:28.980
speakers and we did some
searches in English and the

00:10:28.980 --> 00:10:31.110
stuff came back in English, and
we did some searches in

00:10:31.110 --> 00:10:32.080
Dutch and it came
back in Dutch.

00:10:32.080 --> 00:10:33.600
And I was like, sweet,
that's Google.

00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:38.230
But I guess it's a little bit
different for products.

00:10:38.230 --> 00:10:39.320
CHRIS: It's a little
different.

00:10:39.320 --> 00:10:46.280
And so our first focus is just
getting the [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:10:46.280 --> 00:10:47.522
language experience correct.

00:10:47.522 --> 00:10:51.203
Then we're going to see it
make sense too, to have

00:10:51.203 --> 00:10:53.849
additional languages supported
for each [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:10:59.430 --> 00:11:02.280
ANDREW: I think that probably
answers my question.

00:11:02.280 --> 00:11:05.160
I actually had a question to
follow up the question that

00:11:05.160 --> 00:11:07.100
was previously asked by--

00:11:07.100 --> 00:11:09.030
I'm sorry I didn't catch
the name-- the previous

00:11:09.030 --> 00:11:11.240
questioner.

00:11:11.240 --> 00:11:16.750
Daniel mentioned that if you
delete the product it clears

00:11:16.750 --> 00:11:19.080
it out of the system, including
ratings and things.

00:11:19.080 --> 00:11:20.410
Is that--

00:11:20.410 --> 00:11:22.850
DANIEL: So I'm not 100%
how that works.

00:11:22.850 --> 00:11:28.410
But I think in many cases, if
you like to deactivate a

00:11:28.410 --> 00:11:30.800
product but you know it's coming
back, it can be more

00:11:30.800 --> 00:11:36.160
beneficial for you to set the
expiration date to a date

00:11:36.160 --> 00:11:39.450
that's already passed or
deactivate it in that fashion.

00:11:39.450 --> 00:11:42.900
Rather than to explicitly
delete the product.

00:11:42.900 --> 00:11:43.220
But--

00:11:43.220 --> 00:11:45.650
ANDREW: Yeah, it's unclear if
I can tell if it's going to

00:11:45.650 --> 00:11:46.250
come back or not.

00:11:46.250 --> 00:11:48.680
It's like some stuff becomes
unpopular and then becomes

00:11:48.680 --> 00:11:49.530
popular again.

00:11:49.530 --> 00:11:51.300
And some stuff becomes--

00:11:51.300 --> 00:11:54.270
We usually just do deletes which
helps us keep under the

00:11:54.270 --> 00:11:56.750
quotas and things like that.

00:11:56.750 --> 00:11:59.730
But I was worried that maybe
the Christmas stuff, which

00:11:59.730 --> 00:12:01.950
probably gets deleted in the
middle of the year because

00:12:01.950 --> 00:12:05.040
nobody is looking at it,
nobody's buying it, does that

00:12:05.040 --> 00:12:05.860
stuff then--

00:12:05.860 --> 00:12:10.020
DANIEL: So once an item is
deactivated, it gets purged

00:12:10.020 --> 00:12:14.130
eventually, but there's no
guarantees on how quickly or

00:12:14.130 --> 00:12:16.020
how slowly that purging
will take.

00:12:16.020 --> 00:12:19.900
So I imagine if you deactivated
it in May, by

00:12:19.900 --> 00:12:22.100
November it's gone.

00:12:22.100 --> 00:12:22.480
But I'm not 100%--

00:12:22.480 --> 00:12:23.960
ANDREW: I was more--

00:12:23.960 --> 00:12:26.830
So I guess that kind of
answers my question.

00:12:26.830 --> 00:12:30.370
I was just hoping that maybe
Google was keeping around

00:12:30.370 --> 00:12:32.550
like, this is a good product,
or people click on this

00:12:32.550 --> 00:12:33.500
product, or something.

00:12:33.500 --> 00:12:35.960
And then when it comes back
with the same ID later,

00:12:35.960 --> 00:12:38.830
they're like, sweet, let's
put it back up.

00:12:38.830 --> 00:12:41.190
DANIEL: First, I don't know if
that's true, and second, I

00:12:41.190 --> 00:12:43.840
don't think I could comment
on it if I did know.

00:12:43.840 --> 00:12:44.620
ANDREW: OK.

00:12:44.620 --> 00:12:47.300
Well I mean, we could
do an experiment.

00:12:47.300 --> 00:12:50.340
I understand that
you're launching

00:12:50.340 --> 00:12:52.550
statistics on products.

00:12:52.550 --> 00:12:54.630
Have you been able to
get those back?

00:12:54.630 --> 00:12:57.090
I guess I could delete a
product and look at the

00:12:57.090 --> 00:12:59.580
statistics get deleted after
a few days when I put the

00:12:59.580 --> 00:13:02.560
product back in.

00:13:02.560 --> 00:13:05.320
DANIEL: I'm not sure if you're
talking about the performance,

00:13:05.320 --> 00:13:09.190
or if you're talking
about data quality.

00:13:09.190 --> 00:13:10.440
That's been launched--

00:13:10.440 --> 00:13:14.960
I don't know several months,
eight, nine months.

00:13:14.960 --> 00:13:16.690
ANDREW: For some reason I always
get zeros whenever I

00:13:16.690 --> 00:13:21.470
ask for it, even when they show
numbers on the UI, which

00:13:21.470 --> 00:13:22.250
is sort strange.

00:13:22.250 --> 00:13:24.570
DANIEL: That sounds
like a bug.

00:13:24.570 --> 00:13:26.180
ANDREW: OK, I'll try it again.

00:13:26.180 --> 00:13:29.580
DANIEL: No, like a
bug on our part.

00:13:29.580 --> 00:13:31.810
If you encounter it again,
let me know.

00:13:31.810 --> 00:13:38.320
Post to the forum or do on the
co.google.com/p/shoppingapis

00:13:38.320 --> 00:13:45.250
list. And report it because
they should be the same.

00:13:45.250 --> 00:13:49.300
But I guess that would
be an experiment

00:13:49.300 --> 00:13:52.220
that may reveal something.

00:13:52.220 --> 00:13:54.085
ANDREW: OK cool.

00:13:54.085 --> 00:13:56.400
I'll mute myself so
I don't echo now.

00:13:56.400 --> 00:13:57.520
DANIEL: Cool.

00:13:57.520 --> 00:14:01.260
I would reiterate that if the
does come back, to continue to

00:14:01.260 --> 00:14:06.270
use the same offer
ID for the item.

00:14:06.270 --> 00:14:07.690
DANIEL: Yeah, for sure.

00:14:11.030 --> 00:14:13.300
So Luke, you said you had
some more questions.

00:14:13.300 --> 00:14:14.940
LUKE: Yeah, I'll follow up
on what he just said.

00:14:14.940 --> 00:14:18.220
With regard to the performance
data, I didn't get impressions

00:14:18.220 --> 00:14:20.500
information in those
data points.

00:14:20.500 --> 00:14:21.950
OK, that's coming?

00:14:21.950 --> 00:14:23.500
DANIEL: I don't know
that it's coming.

00:14:23.500 --> 00:14:26.030
I haven't brought it up
with the team yet.

00:14:26.030 --> 00:14:28.980
It doesn't seem like it'd
be too difficult to do.

00:14:28.980 --> 00:14:31.570
But I wasn't around when the
original feature was launched,

00:14:31.570 --> 00:14:33.570
I don't know why it's not
included, because clicks and

00:14:33.570 --> 00:14:37.510
impressions sort of
go side by side.

00:14:37.510 --> 00:14:40.970
That's on my to-do list of
something to follow up with.

00:14:40.970 --> 00:14:43.820
I agree with you that that's
good data to have but I don't

00:14:43.820 --> 00:14:48.180
know how available it is or how
easy it is to implement.

00:14:48.180 --> 00:14:50.350
LUKE: Sale price and sale price
effective date, they're

00:14:50.350 --> 00:14:51.910
not in the .net client
library, at

00:14:51.910 --> 00:14:53.710
least not version 1.9.

00:14:53.710 --> 00:14:54.695
DANIEL: Sounds like a bug.

00:14:54.695 --> 00:14:56.700
LUKE: Oh really?

00:14:56.700 --> 00:14:58.220
DANIEL: I will get
those in there.

00:15:00.970 --> 00:15:02.720
Yeah, that one--

00:15:02.720 --> 00:15:09.690
the guy who was on the content
API before me didn't do C

00:15:09.690 --> 00:15:12.440
sharp.net and didn't really
ever touch it.

00:15:12.440 --> 00:15:14.480
He just kind of asked for help
from other people who didn't

00:15:14.480 --> 00:15:16.270
know the content API.

00:15:16.270 --> 00:15:22.880
And I was the same-- didn't know
C sharp, didn't know .net

00:15:22.880 --> 00:15:25.890
but I've started to actually
look at the library and try to

00:15:25.890 --> 00:15:27.310
understand some stuff.

00:15:27.310 --> 00:15:29.690
It's a little different
situation but every once in

00:15:29.690 --> 00:15:32.600
awhile, I'll come across an
attribute that isn't in there

00:15:32.600 --> 00:15:33.530
that should be.

00:15:33.530 --> 00:15:37.530
And that's just some sort of
oversight from somebody less

00:15:37.530 --> 00:15:39.780
familiar with the API itself.

00:15:39.780 --> 00:15:42.980
But I will get those in
there if they're not.

00:15:42.980 --> 00:15:47.460
And I assume, if I get them in
the library and there's no

00:15:47.460 --> 00:15:49.490
release, you can build
everything locally, right?

00:15:49.490 --> 00:15:50.990
You're good doing that?

00:15:50.990 --> 00:15:53.200
With something this complex and
this big, we're not just

00:15:53.200 --> 00:15:57.960
going to do a release for
15 lines of code.

00:15:57.960 --> 00:16:00.000
All right, that's good.

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:02.610
Sounds like that was the last
two questions you had.

00:16:02.610 --> 00:16:07.040
John, do you have
any questions?

00:16:07.040 --> 00:16:07.820
JOHN: No.

00:16:07.820 --> 00:16:09.070
No direct questions.

00:16:11.920 --> 00:16:14.020
I can include one.

00:16:14.020 --> 00:16:16.380
It's really about the
exception process.

00:16:16.380 --> 00:16:24.490
We host many shops, and some of
our shops don't have brands

00:16:24.490 --> 00:16:27.430
and the mandatory fields,
the unique IDs.

00:16:27.430 --> 00:16:31.180
And then, I know that the
customer services have to do a

00:16:31.180 --> 00:16:33.780
manual exception process.

00:16:33.780 --> 00:16:35.832
It would be good if we had an
API to do that so we can

00:16:35.832 --> 00:16:36.820
automate it.

00:16:36.820 --> 00:16:39.790
So I guess I just need to put in
a change request, I guess,

00:16:39.790 --> 00:16:42.480
or a feature request.

00:16:42.480 --> 00:16:43.490
DANIEL: Whose customer
service?

00:16:43.490 --> 00:16:45.840
Our customer service has--

00:16:45.840 --> 00:16:48.320
JOHN: No, our company's
customer service.

00:16:48.320 --> 00:16:49.060
DANIEL: OK.

00:16:49.060 --> 00:16:53.850
JOHN: So what happens is
that we host shops.

00:16:53.850 --> 00:16:55.975
A shop will register.

00:16:55.975 --> 00:16:57.980
They won't put the unique
IDs in, so we

00:16:57.980 --> 00:16:59.270
don't upload any products.

00:16:59.270 --> 00:17:00.160
Instead, we give them alerts.

00:17:00.160 --> 00:17:02.560
That say we can't upload
these, [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:17:02.560 --> 00:17:03.220
ID.

00:17:03.220 --> 00:17:07.319
They come back to say, we make
artificial flowers, or we make

00:17:07.319 --> 00:17:09.150
this, we make that.

00:17:09.150 --> 00:17:11.690
We then apply for an
exemption manually.

00:17:14.250 --> 00:17:17.599
And we manually then
upload-- sorry--

00:17:17.599 --> 00:17:20.000
we then set a flag and the
product's uploaded.

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:23.579
Well, customer services would
like all that automated.

00:17:23.579 --> 00:17:27.270
I guess I need put that in
as a feature request.

00:17:27.270 --> 00:17:30.880
DANIEL: Yeah if you want to
email me or ping the forum, or

00:17:30.880 --> 00:17:39.140
I guess just put it right on
shopping API's issues list,

00:17:39.140 --> 00:17:41.690
especially the form where you're
actually filing for the

00:17:41.690 --> 00:17:42.820
exemptions would be helpful.

00:17:42.820 --> 00:17:44.410
Because I'm not 100%
familiar with that

00:17:44.410 --> 00:17:45.540
process since it is--

00:17:45.540 --> 00:17:47.940
JOHN: Sure.

00:17:47.940 --> 00:17:51.270
I'm not familiar with the
process, the customer will

00:17:51.270 --> 00:17:51.850
deal with that.

00:17:51.850 --> 00:17:54.610
But I know that at the regular
meetings they bring it out

00:17:54.610 --> 00:17:57.550
that they spend a lot
of time doing this.

00:17:57.550 --> 00:18:01.140
What I want to try to is make
sure that no data is uploaded

00:18:01.140 --> 00:18:04.530
by the API unless it's valid and
contains all the necessary

00:18:04.530 --> 00:18:05.950
managing fields.

00:18:05.950 --> 00:18:09.160
So we actually stop
it at that point.

00:18:09.160 --> 00:18:09.730
Alright, Daniel.

00:18:09.730 --> 00:18:10.660
Anyway, thanks very much.

00:18:10.660 --> 00:18:13.070
DANIEL: Sure.

00:18:13.070 --> 00:18:18.390
CHRIS: In terms of the process
that is-- that's a relatively

00:18:18.390 --> 00:18:21.900
good understanding of the
process so if the content is

00:18:21.900 --> 00:18:26.990
in the unique identifiers,
we would flag that.

00:18:26.990 --> 00:18:28.680
And then there is an exemption
process in which

00:18:28.680 --> 00:18:30.770
[UNINTELLIGIBLE] could say,
oh yeah, we sell hand-made

00:18:30.770 --> 00:18:34.530
flowers or artificial flowers,
and then our team reviews the

00:18:34.530 --> 00:18:37.220
content and it exempts the
account from [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:18:37.220 --> 00:18:41.580
unique identifiers, if
that's the case.

00:18:41.580 --> 00:18:45.590
DANIEL: So you mean a unique
identifier like a G10.

00:18:45.590 --> 00:18:46.520
CHRIS: Yeah.

00:18:46.520 --> 00:18:48.200
DANIEL: OK.

00:18:48.200 --> 00:18:51.770
I'm going to ping you off this,
with a question that I

00:18:51.770 --> 00:18:52.440
don't know if is appropriate.

00:18:52.440 --> 00:18:55.000
But--

00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:55.270
JOHN: Yeah.

00:18:55.270 --> 00:18:57.950
Their exactly the filter you
look for, they've got to have

00:18:57.950 --> 00:18:59.380
a G10, they've got
to have a brand.

00:18:59.380 --> 00:19:00.210
I think that's [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:19:00.210 --> 00:19:03.830
fields, OK, that they've got to
have. And we make sure that

00:19:03.830 --> 00:19:06.470
our shops have completed
those.

00:19:06.470 --> 00:19:09.070
And if they haven't, then we
stop the product from being

00:19:09.070 --> 00:19:13.300
uploaded, and make sure those
fields have been filled in.

00:19:13.300 --> 00:19:22.460
DANIEL: And Chris, do you know
is there a way to include like

00:19:22.460 --> 00:19:28.860
handmade or something like that,
in the G10, or is that

00:19:28.860 --> 00:19:32.630
something that really, it just
has to go through this formal

00:19:32.630 --> 00:19:34.140
process currently.

00:19:34.140 --> 00:19:37.140
CHRIS: So there is another
way to do that.

00:19:37.140 --> 00:19:38.470
We're looking at--

00:19:38.470 --> 00:19:41.120
so our team is sort of looking
at this and seeing how we can

00:19:41.120 --> 00:19:42.370
make it more efficient.

00:19:46.030 --> 00:19:48.200
We don't have the ability to
say, oh these are custom

00:19:48.200 --> 00:19:51.280
products so you don't need to
flag these at this point.

00:19:51.280 --> 00:19:52.110
DANIEL: Right.

00:19:52.110 --> 00:19:56.490
And I'm sure, John, there's some
level of human validation

00:19:56.490 --> 00:20:00.140
that's going on that it may be
hard to take away from the

00:20:00.140 --> 00:20:04.970
process because of things like
spam and such that may want to

00:20:04.970 --> 00:20:09.490
circumvent the review process
programmatically.

00:20:09.490 --> 00:20:11.100
But I don't know off
the top of my head.

00:20:11.100 --> 00:20:14.040
It's certainly a
complex issue.

00:20:14.040 --> 00:20:14.490
JOHN: Certainly.

00:20:14.490 --> 00:20:16.070
I'm not expecting an
instant response.

00:20:16.070 --> 00:20:16.850
[UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:20:16.850 --> 00:20:19.430
imagine would work, is we'd
say, we apply for an

00:20:19.430 --> 00:20:21.410
extension, and a couple of
days later after you've

00:20:21.410 --> 00:20:25.430
validated the sites, and done
all your checks, you would

00:20:25.430 --> 00:20:28.335
then come back and maybe we'd
get some sort of automated

00:20:28.335 --> 00:20:28.990
request back.

00:20:28.990 --> 00:20:31.610
So, I'm not suggesting an
instantaneous exemption

00:20:31.610 --> 00:20:36.270
process, I'm more saying taking
the manual process out,

00:20:36.270 --> 00:20:38.590
because that becomes kind of
almost zero touch, kind of.

00:20:41.110 --> 00:20:42.410
[UNINTELLIGIBLE], can I ask
you a quick question about

00:20:42.410 --> 00:20:44.330
G10, and about validation?

00:20:44.330 --> 00:20:47.480
In the moment we kind of just
passed that through.

00:20:47.480 --> 00:20:49.600
Have you got any recommendations
on any vetting

00:20:49.600 --> 00:20:50.680
that we should apply?

00:20:50.680 --> 00:20:53.370
I know G10 is so open-ended.

00:20:53.370 --> 00:20:55.440
Because obviously what I'm keen
to do is try and validate

00:20:55.440 --> 00:20:57.190
data before we upload it.

00:20:57.190 --> 00:20:58.240
DANIEL: Sure.

00:20:58.240 --> 00:21:00.300
I have no clue.

00:21:00.300 --> 00:21:02.000
So I will defer to
Chris and Raf.

00:21:04.950 --> 00:21:07.430
CHRIS: I don't have anything
specific right now.

00:21:07.430 --> 00:21:10.025
I actually would need to
review all the G10

00:21:10.025 --> 00:21:10.470
requirements.

00:21:10.470 --> 00:21:13.140
It's not something I've
looked at recently.

00:21:13.140 --> 00:21:17.090
DANIEL: Do you know if there
are external services, or

00:21:17.090 --> 00:21:19.620
places even within Google,
where we have

00:21:19.620 --> 00:21:21.580
some official listing--

00:21:21.580 --> 00:21:24.930
some sort of thing that you
could check against to do

00:21:24.930 --> 00:21:27.990
vetting, like John says.

00:21:27.990 --> 00:21:31.990
CHRIS: Is there specific
attributes or specific values

00:21:31.990 --> 00:21:33.830
that you are interested
in knowing?

00:21:33.830 --> 00:21:37.170
I think brand, we don't
have anything.

00:21:37.170 --> 00:21:41.450
UPC I think, there's a
simple digit check.

00:21:41.450 --> 00:21:42.640
Is there a right amount
of digits?

00:21:42.640 --> 00:21:45.480
And then we do the
check digit--

00:21:45.480 --> 00:21:49.700
like I forget exactly how it
works-- but when you add these

00:21:49.700 --> 00:21:51.240
numbers does the last
digit, do they all

00:21:51.240 --> 00:21:53.222
add up to the last--

00:21:53.222 --> 00:21:53.800
It's called Check Digit.

00:21:53.800 --> 00:21:54.860
I would need to look into it.

00:21:54.860 --> 00:21:57.165
But we do that sort
of checking.

00:21:57.165 --> 00:21:58.680
But not all UPCs actually--

00:22:01.630 --> 00:22:02.380
DANIEL: Fall into that.

00:22:02.380 --> 00:22:05.370
Yeah.

00:22:05.370 --> 00:22:10.340
CHRIS: So beyond that, I don't
know if there's anything more

00:22:10.340 --> 00:22:12.660
that you could do.

00:22:12.660 --> 00:22:14.650
I mean, I think UPC is the
easiest one to sort of

00:22:14.650 --> 00:22:17.050
validate that it's at least
in the correct format.

00:22:23.476 --> 00:22:27.390
The method we do, really
internally, it's not something

00:22:27.390 --> 00:22:29.690
we can do during processing,
the initial [? fee ?]

00:22:29.690 --> 00:22:30.230
processing.

00:22:30.230 --> 00:22:31.600
We do it much more internally.

00:22:31.600 --> 00:22:33.700
Once we get the data, we start
to sort of sift over it and

00:22:33.700 --> 00:22:35.014
understand what these
products are.

00:22:35.014 --> 00:22:38.151
And that's when we start to do
some additional validation on

00:22:38.151 --> 00:22:40.675
unique identifiers.

00:22:40.675 --> 00:22:43.090
And that's really hard
for you to do.

00:22:43.090 --> 00:22:44.340
DANIEL: Through the API, yeah.

00:22:47.040 --> 00:22:48.060
JOHN: Thanks very much.

00:22:48.060 --> 00:22:49.310
DANIEL: Sure.

00:22:51.800 --> 00:22:54.540
So does anybody else
have questions?

00:22:54.540 --> 00:22:56.830
Well, Danny, I wanted to ask
about the multi-client

00:22:56.830 --> 00:22:59.640
account, and some business
information and customer

00:22:59.640 --> 00:23:01.110
service information
through the app.

00:23:01.110 --> 00:23:04.310
Is that something that is coming
up, like in the future?

00:23:04.310 --> 00:23:06.366
DANIEL: That's another one of
those that I need to talk to

00:23:06.366 --> 00:23:08.600
the team about.

00:23:08.600 --> 00:23:11.370
There are definitely
gaps there that I

00:23:11.370 --> 00:23:13.130
think should be fixed.

00:23:13.130 --> 00:23:15.640
But I don't know what the
resources are to get them

00:23:15.640 --> 00:23:18.960
fixed or how difficult it
would be to fix them.

00:23:18.960 --> 00:23:21.760
But I will certainly
drive that forward.

00:23:21.760 --> 00:23:26.755
Because I went through the
process on the merchants in

00:23:26.755 --> 00:23:30.940
our UI, and it does seem sort
of counterintuitive that you

00:23:30.940 --> 00:23:33.300
wouldn't be able to do that
through the API as well.

00:23:33.300 --> 00:23:33.640
LUKE: Yeah.

00:23:33.640 --> 00:23:36.540
I like the idea of my own
customers being able to-- it's

00:23:36.540 --> 00:23:38.240
completely automated on
my side when their

00:23:38.240 --> 00:23:39.070
account is set up.

00:23:39.070 --> 00:23:42.766
Well I could also set up there
sub-account automatically, if

00:23:42.766 --> 00:23:44.290
I could just kind of fill
that information in.

00:23:44.290 --> 00:23:46.230
And then of course, the shipping
and tax, I'm going to

00:23:46.230 --> 00:23:47.650
have to contact them on.

00:23:47.650 --> 00:23:49.120
Cause we're going to have to
look at their Google checkout

00:23:49.120 --> 00:23:51.590
account and then make sure
those two sets match.

00:23:51.590 --> 00:23:54.500
But at least that block
would be cool to add.

00:23:54.500 --> 00:23:55.850
DANIEL: Yeah, for sure.

00:23:55.850 --> 00:23:59.130
And that's another big request,
has been setting

00:23:59.130 --> 00:24:01.750
account level, tax, and shipping
through the API which

00:24:01.750 --> 00:24:04.390
currently isn't available
either.

00:24:04.390 --> 00:24:06.610
And it's something we may
get done this quarter.

00:24:06.610 --> 00:24:10.570
This last quarter we had, I
think, three or four launches.

00:24:10.570 --> 00:24:15.340
So, like maintenance
requests like these

00:24:15.340 --> 00:24:17.750
were sort of secondary.

00:24:17.750 --> 00:24:19.490
And this quarter I don't know
that we're going to have as

00:24:19.490 --> 00:24:20.810
many launches.

00:24:20.810 --> 00:24:22.790
I don't know if you guys have
gotten to use any of those

00:24:22.790 --> 00:24:25.040
features from last quarter,
but there's a pretty cool

00:24:25.040 --> 00:24:27.870
feature, the API dashboard,
within the merchant center,

00:24:27.870 --> 00:24:32.000
that'll actually show you every
type of error you have,

00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:37.560
the number of occurrences of
that error, and then also

00:24:37.560 --> 00:24:38.890
it'll give you examples.

00:24:38.890 --> 00:24:41.170
Example request and the
example response

00:24:41.170 --> 00:24:41.940
error return to it.

00:24:41.940 --> 00:24:42.930
It's really neat if you--

00:24:42.930 --> 00:24:44.860
ANDREW: I love that feature.

00:24:44.860 --> 00:24:45.490
DANIEL: Awesome.

00:24:45.490 --> 00:24:48.600
It's great to hear we have
some happy users.

00:24:48.600 --> 00:24:50.950
It's actually getting better.

00:24:50.950 --> 00:24:53.440
I don't know when it's
launching, but we're writing

00:24:53.440 --> 00:24:54.330
up a blog post--

00:24:54.330 --> 00:24:57.470
or we're writing up some more
documentation about it, but

00:24:57.470 --> 00:25:00.010
you'll actually be able to
replay requests from the

00:25:00.010 --> 00:25:00.440
merchant center.

00:25:00.440 --> 00:25:03.440
So you can change a little bit
of text, run it in dry run

00:25:03.440 --> 00:25:04.450
mode, and see if it works.

00:25:04.450 --> 00:25:05.760
So you can actually--

00:25:05.760 --> 00:25:08.110
maybe not as relevant to you
Andrew, since you're super

00:25:08.110 --> 00:25:11.610
technical-- but for some other
people are still fudging

00:25:11.610 --> 00:25:14.750
around trying to make requests
work, they can actually change

00:25:14.750 --> 00:25:18.260
requests in the merchant center
UI, and fiddle around

00:25:18.260 --> 00:25:19.690
until they can actually
make them work.

00:25:19.690 --> 00:25:20.980
It's going to be super neat.

00:25:20.980 --> 00:25:24.090
ANDREW: We had a character
encoding issue that was caused

00:25:24.090 --> 00:25:26.530
by some data that got changed
in the database.

00:25:26.530 --> 00:25:30.350
And I was like, I don't know,
I didn't do anything.

00:25:30.350 --> 00:25:32.080
What happened?

00:25:32.080 --> 00:25:36.250
But the API dashboard was just
like, this is what's wrong.

00:25:36.250 --> 00:25:36.860
DANIEL: That's awesome.

00:25:36.860 --> 00:25:38.330
ANDREW: And I was so excited.

00:25:38.330 --> 00:25:39.350
DANIEL: Yeah, for sure.

00:25:39.350 --> 00:25:40.600
That's awesome.

00:25:43.040 --> 00:25:46.480
But anyway Luke, not to derail
from your question too much,

00:25:46.480 --> 00:25:49.260
I'm certainly going to be
pushing these through.

00:25:49.260 --> 00:25:52.590
And it'll probably be in the
next week or two once I get

00:25:52.590 --> 00:25:54.350
these developer guys launched.

00:25:54.350 --> 00:25:58.070
I know that's something you
want as well, the feature

00:25:58.070 --> 00:26:00.930
parody with the other languages
and being able to do

00:26:00.930 --> 00:26:03.100
everything you want to
with the .net library

00:26:03.100 --> 00:26:04.020
and things like that.

00:26:04.020 --> 00:26:06.790
And it's something I'm
concentrating on with most of

00:26:06.790 --> 00:26:07.900
my time right now.

00:26:07.900 --> 00:26:08.660
But I will--

00:26:08.660 --> 00:26:12.220
LUKE: I'm glad to hear that
Google is pro-Microsoft.

00:26:12.220 --> 00:26:14.370
DANIEL: Well, no it's
pro-developer.

00:26:14.370 --> 00:26:18.385
And there's a strong .net
community, so that's my job,

00:26:18.385 --> 00:26:19.635
right, make you happy.

00:26:22.182 --> 00:26:24.900
C# isn't so bad, I guess.

00:26:24.900 --> 00:26:31.300
I'm a Python guy, and I miss
private variables and I miss

00:26:31.300 --> 00:26:33.260
functions with more
than one signature

00:26:33.260 --> 00:26:34.934
and things like that.

00:26:34.934 --> 00:26:36.130
LUKE: It's so easy
in our languages,

00:26:36.130 --> 00:26:38.670
you know what I mean?

00:26:38.670 --> 00:26:43.610
DANIEL: I prefer duck typing
still, but that's me.

00:26:43.610 --> 00:26:46.170
But it's refreshing every
once in awhile.

00:26:46.170 --> 00:26:47.330
Compiled languages--

00:26:47.330 --> 00:26:49.210
computers are pretty powerful
these days.

00:26:49.210 --> 00:26:52.230
I don't know how long compiled
languages will be around.

00:26:52.230 --> 00:26:55.210
Probably for awhile,
given the--

00:26:55.210 --> 00:26:57.270
JOHN: You have to order
a raspberry pi.

00:26:57.270 --> 00:26:58.260
DANIEL: What's that?

00:26:58.260 --> 00:27:01.020
JOHN: You have to order
a raspberry pi.

00:27:01.020 --> 00:27:02.740
DANIEL: Why's that?

00:27:02.740 --> 00:27:04.240
JOHN: Have you heard of
the raspberry pi?

00:27:04.240 --> 00:27:06.610
DANIEL: No, is it
a python joke?

00:27:06.610 --> 00:27:10.880
JOHN: No, it's a $20 computer.

00:27:10.880 --> 00:27:16.230
JOHN: And the [? python ?],
it runs Linux.

00:27:16.230 --> 00:27:19.545
They're aiming it for
educational tool, and they're

00:27:19.545 --> 00:27:20.155
pushing Python.

00:27:20.155 --> 00:27:23.164
So you need to order
your raspberry pi.

00:27:23.164 --> 00:27:25.020
DANIEL: For $20 why not?

00:27:25.020 --> 00:27:25.660
JOHN: Just Google it.

00:27:25.660 --> 00:27:27.270
Google raspberry pi.

00:27:27.270 --> 00:27:27.730
DANIEL: OK.

00:27:27.730 --> 00:27:28.900
I'll Google it.

00:27:28.900 --> 00:27:31.790
JOHN: That's p-i, by the way,
as opposed to p-i-e.

00:27:31.790 --> 00:27:31.990
[UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:27:31.990 --> 00:27:35.070
Daniel, can I just
say actually, a

00:27:35.070 --> 00:27:36.340
really bit of good feedback.

00:27:36.340 --> 00:27:39.710
Actually the [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:27:39.710 --> 00:27:41.380
several months, OK.

00:27:41.380 --> 00:27:43.480
And it's working beautifully.

00:27:43.480 --> 00:27:46.310
Every day, it sends up its
updates and things, and it

00:27:46.310 --> 00:27:48.260
just works.

00:27:48.260 --> 00:27:51.470
So I know, through the forums,
there is lots of people

00:27:51.470 --> 00:27:54.210
questioning things and
challenging you with difficult

00:27:54.210 --> 00:27:56.470
questions and everything,
but we found the

00:27:56.470 --> 00:27:58.880
interface works great.

00:27:58.880 --> 00:27:59.890
DANIEL: That's awesome.

00:27:59.890 --> 00:28:03.090
Thanks for the feedback.

00:28:03.090 --> 00:28:07.940
Yeah, we try to make sure
there's uptime all the time

00:28:07.940 --> 00:28:09.300
across all Google services.

00:28:09.300 --> 00:28:14.390
And I think it is pretty
refreshing, especially given

00:28:14.390 --> 00:28:17.060
some of the more fledgling
services, some of the issues

00:28:17.060 --> 00:28:21.890
you can have.

00:28:21.890 --> 00:28:27.100
So Luke, if you do have specific
questions on use of

00:28:27.100 --> 00:28:29.430
the client library,
let me know.

00:28:29.430 --> 00:28:30.810
I'll make an announcement
tomorrow or

00:28:30.810 --> 00:28:32.300
maybe even later today.

00:28:32.300 --> 00:28:34.560
We'll do another one exactly
two weeks from today.

00:28:34.560 --> 00:28:42.980
So April 32, aka May 2.

00:28:42.980 --> 00:28:44.280
And I guess I'll see
you guys then.

00:28:44.280 --> 00:28:48.070
It will be at 10 Eastern, which
what's the UK is plus

00:28:48.070 --> 00:28:48.870
eight, I believe.

00:28:48.870 --> 00:28:51.920
So that is--

00:28:51.920 --> 00:28:52.700
10 Pacific.

00:28:52.700 --> 00:28:53.680
Oh I'm so sorry.

00:28:53.680 --> 00:28:59.690
Yes it will be at 10 Pacific,
which I believe is 6:00 PM in

00:28:59.690 --> 00:29:01.062
the UK, yeah John?

00:29:01.062 --> 00:29:02.190
JOHN: Yeah, that's correct.

00:29:02.190 --> 00:29:05.380
It's 6:36 in the UK
at the moment.

00:29:05.380 --> 00:29:05.910
DANIEL: Great.

00:29:05.910 --> 00:29:06.640
Cool.

00:29:06.640 --> 00:29:08.240
So thanks everyone.

00:29:08.240 --> 00:29:12.630
Thanks especially to Chris
and Raf for showing up.

00:29:12.630 --> 00:29:16.730
And we'll try to get back and
post to the forum with the

00:29:16.730 --> 00:29:19.490
questions that we couldn't
answer to your satisfaction.

00:29:19.490 --> 00:29:21.660
All right?

00:29:21.660 --> 00:29:22.390
See you guys.

00:29:22.390 --> 00:29:24.180
Thanks.

00:29:24.180 --> 00:29:25.430
Bye.
