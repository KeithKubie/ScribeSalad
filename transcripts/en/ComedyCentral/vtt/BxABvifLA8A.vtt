00:00:01.134 --> 00:00:03.103
Yesterday, Anderson Cooper
interviewed future divorcÃ©e

00:00:03.136 --> 00:00:07.174
Melania Trump and asked her
what she'd try to accomplish

00:00:07.207 --> 00:00:08.876
if she becomes first lady.

00:00:08.909 --> 00:00:12.279
21st century--
the social media--

00:00:12.312 --> 00:00:14.748
it's very damaging
for the children.

00:00:14.781 --> 00:00:18.318
We need to guide them and
teach them about social media,

00:00:18.352 --> 00:00:21.522
because I see a lot
of negativity on it,

00:00:21.555 --> 00:00:24.725
and, uh, we need to help them.

00:00:24.758 --> 00:00:26.226
-(laughter)
-JOYCE: Hey, do you think

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:29.396
we can put Melania next
to the Dracula candelabra?

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:31.265
-Is that...?
-(laughter)

00:00:31.298 --> 00:00:33.967
-(applause)
-100 points for Jesse Joyce.

00:00:34.001 --> 00:00:35.802
Holy cow.

00:00:37.304 --> 00:00:39.873
(imitating Dracula): One way
I'm going to combat negativity

00:00:39.907 --> 00:00:41.942
on social media--
to suck your blood! Uh...

00:00:41.975 --> 00:00:43.944
-(laughter)
-(hissing)

00:00:43.977 --> 00:00:45.812
-(Joyce imitates wings flapping)
-I wonder what...

00:00:45.846 --> 00:00:48.949
-(laughter) -I mean, geez, guys,
I wonder why she thinks

00:00:48.982 --> 00:00:50.617
there's a lot of negativity
on social media.

00:00:50.651 --> 00:00:51.985
What's that all about?
I don't know.

00:00:52.019 --> 00:00:53.620
Maybe 'cause one
of the only people

00:00:53.654 --> 00:00:55.489
she follows does stuff like
call other people,

00:00:55.522 --> 00:00:57.391
"unattractive
both inside and out,"

00:00:57.424 --> 00:00:59.560
or "a low class slob,"

00:00:59.593 --> 00:01:01.328
or a "dopey clown,"

00:01:01.361 --> 00:01:03.697
or a "total asshole,"

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:05.499
or a "pussy."

00:01:05.532 --> 00:01:07.401
Or they look "like (bleep)."

00:01:07.434 --> 00:01:11.338
Or "disgusting" with, quote,
"nipples protruding."

00:01:11.371 --> 00:01:14.341
-(laughter)
-Why would...?

00:01:14.374 --> 00:01:17.311
I mean, why would Melania wait

00:01:17.344 --> 00:01:20.447
until she's First Lady to reduce
negativity on social media

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:23.183
when she could just as easily
replace her husband's phone

00:01:23.217 --> 00:01:25.786
with an exploding
Samsung Galaxy Note 7?

00:01:25.819 --> 00:01:29.456
(applause and cheering)

00:01:29.489 --> 00:01:33.727
So much negativity.

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:35.696
Comedians, given
that Melania wants to go after

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:37.664
Trump-like cyber bullying,
what do you think

00:01:37.698 --> 00:01:40.100
some of her other goals
might be? Matthew.

00:01:40.133 --> 00:01:42.636
Designing grab-proof
women's underwear.

00:01:42.669 --> 00:01:44.471
-HARDWICK: All right, points.
-(laughter)

00:01:44.505 --> 00:01:46.907
-(applause)
-Points. Jesse Joyce.

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:48.976
Uh, I don't know.
Something about gypsies.

00:01:49.009 --> 00:01:50.410
It's impossible
to understand her.

00:01:50.444 --> 00:01:52.679
I don't have any Count-Chocula-
to-English dictionary.

00:01:52.713 --> 00:01:55.716
-HARDWICK: All right.
-(laughter)

00:01:58.118 --> 00:01:59.720
Carmen Lynch.

00:01:59.753 --> 00:02:02.122
Whatever goals
Michelle Obama has.

00:02:02.155 --> 00:02:03.790
-(laughter) -HARDWICK: Yeah,
all right. Points.

00:02:03.824 --> 00:02:03.891
-Points. -Nice.
-(applause and cheering)
