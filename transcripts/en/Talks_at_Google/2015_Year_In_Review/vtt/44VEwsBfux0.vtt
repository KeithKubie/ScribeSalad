FEMALE SPEAKER:
Welcome, everybody.

00:00:02.590 --> 00:00:06.240
Please join us in welcoming
Haben Girma today to Google.

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:10.740
She is a Harvard Law graduate,
the first deaf-blind graduate

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:12.220
from Harvard Law School.

00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:15.060
And she is a pioneer
in everything

00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:19.100
that has to do with
technology for accessibility.

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:23.490
So she has been helping
a very, very in depth

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:27.600
with developing technology
that is useful for people

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:28.920
with disabilities.

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:32.450
She is also a Disability
Rights Advocates member,

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:34.980
and encourages the development
of any sorts of accessible

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:35.490
technology.

00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:38.050
She's here today to
talk to us about how

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:41.300
technology has enabled her
to be where she is today.

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:43.970
And she also encourages
all of us, being at Google,

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:47.560
to help with further development
of these types of technologies.

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:49.500
And with me, I have
[? Umrit ?] who

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:52.060
has gotten to know Haben
at Harvard Law School.

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:53.650
So he'll tell you
a little bit more

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:56.261
of a personal story about her.

00:00:56.261 --> 00:00:56.760
UMRIT: Yeah.

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:57.260
Thank you.

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:59.460
Thank you all for coming.

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.520
I'm sure as the
project introduction

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:05.349
kind of foretold, and as you've
probably seen in Haben's bio,

00:01:05.349 --> 00:01:07.660
and everything else
that's written about her

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:08.840
in many different places.

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:13.880
She's an incredible,
inspiring, influential person.

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:16.680
But a project
and-- Not but, and.

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.980
[INAUDIBLE] asked me
just to share just

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:21.610
a quick, personal, anecdote.

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:24.350
And with the one thing
I wanted to say--

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:27.520
and the truth is you'll
see this very soon,

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:30.600
is that the Haben is one
of the most optimistic,

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:35.390
encouraging, and curious
people that I've ever met.

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:38.290
And I think that's one of
things that really shines out

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:39.300
about her.

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:44.270
Some of you will I think
you hear this in her voice.

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:49.200
But you'll really sense it in
the words that she's saying.

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.830
So as [INAUDIBLE]
had mentioned, Haben

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:53.980
ans I went to law
school together,

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:58.600
actually quite a number of years
ago now, which seems strange.

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:03.070
And we met in our
first year law school.

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:05.980
And in that community, in the
law school community, actually

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:08.229
also beyond it, Haben
and in some ways

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:11.130
actually extended my boundaries
beyond the law school bubble

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:12.710
pretty quickly.

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:15.670
She, again, was known
for being someone

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:19.320
who's just absolutely
optimistic, absolutely positive

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:21.790
and engaging in that way.

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:26.060
And I feel very lucky
that she lives here.

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:29.680
Although, sometimes the East Bay
feels really, really far away.

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:32.340
But I think one
thing I've noticed

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:35.160
even here is that Haben's
friends are all really

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:38.260
fascinating, amazing people.

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:39.890
And it's no surprise, in a way.

00:02:41.159 --> 00:02:42.950
Just the one last thing
I wanted to mention

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:45.730
was that I had taken--
the one that I recalled

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:48.460
when [INAUDIBLE] had asked
if I could just to share

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:53.120
a few words, is that I had
taken Haben to the opera,

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:54.850
I guess last year, now.

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:59.260
And by the way, slight plug, all
of you should go to the opera.

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:01.800
Because Google gives--
the San Jose Opera,

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:05.000
Google gives, like, $30
tickets for front row seats,

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:06.840
which is an amazing perk.

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:09.730
So I used that Perk
and took Haben with me.

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:12.960
And one thing that was very
clear was at the perspective

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:15.780
that she's able to, and
willing to, and curious enough

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:18.550
to share throughout
the experience,

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:23.670
was just in kind of
fulfills, and even takes

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:26.910
further my own experience.

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:28.630
She did, during
the intermission,

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:31.334
though, get really excited.

00:03:31.334 --> 00:03:33.500
Because we're talking about
something that the opera

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:34.730
house could have done better.

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:38.270
And she said, hey, [? Umrit ?],
we should sue the opera house.

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:42.840
And I remember thinking in
that moment, a note to self,

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:45.520
that I should never
bring Haben to Google.

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:47.770
[LAUGHTER]

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:52.800
And can then go in a
project that did just that.

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:58.070
But all joking aside, I'm
actually very encouraged,

00:03:58.070 --> 00:04:00.964
and happy that Haben is
fighting the good fight,

00:04:00.964 --> 00:04:01.880
fighting these fights.

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:05.230
And sometimes that might mean,
probably already has meant,

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:07.650
but it almost
certainly will mean,

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:09.080
suing Google in some capacity.

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:11.910
Or at least challenging
Google to do things better.

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:15.240
And I am glad that
someone who has, again,

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:17.769
that optimism, that curiosity,
and that encouragement

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:21.329
is the one that's
the challenging.

00:04:21.329 --> 00:04:22.504
So, that's it.

00:04:22.504 --> 00:04:23.920
And I should
introduce [? Gopi ?].

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:25.660
Are you going to take over now?

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:26.230
No.

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:27.150
[? Gopi ?] is going to
take over at some point.

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:27.858
You all know him.

00:04:27.858 --> 00:04:29.090
He's amazing.

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:29.590
All right.

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:31.430
Without anything else, Haben.

00:04:33.398 --> 00:04:35.858
[APPLAUSE]

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:43.939
HABEN GIRMA: Good afternoon.

00:04:43.939 --> 00:04:44.980
AUDIENCE: Good afternoon.

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:49.690
HABEN GIRMA: My
name is Haben Girma.

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:51.470
I am so grateful to be here.

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:54.240
Thank you, [? Umrit ?], for
the wonderful introduction,

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:57.252
and reminding me
of the opera trip.

00:04:57.252 --> 00:04:59.710
[LAUGHTER]

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:03.420
HABEN GIRMA: So, I work at
Disability Rights Advocates.

00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:07.450
It's a nonprofit legal
center based in Berkeley.

00:05:07.450 --> 00:05:10.460
And we help increase access
for people with disabilities.

00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:16.200
One of the reasons I'm
really excited to be here

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:19.275
is that Google has an
extraordinary mission

00:05:19.275 --> 00:05:22.050
to organize the
information of the world,

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:26.230
and make it
accessible, and useful.

00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:29.950
In honor of the 25th
anniversary of the Americans

00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:32.950
with Disabilities
Act, I want to talk

00:05:32.950 --> 00:05:36.560
about what we can do
to make information

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:38.705
more accessible for
people with disabilities.

00:05:41.390 --> 00:05:43.563
So first, I want to talk
about communication.

00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:47.500
I'm deaf-blind.

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:50.620
So if you have a question,
and raise your hand,

00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:53.245
it's going to be up
there for a long time.

00:05:53.245 --> 00:05:55.420
[LAUGHTER]

00:05:55.420 --> 00:05:58.800
And if you shout it out, I'm
not going to be able to hear it.

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:02.130
So for communication, I use a
keyboard in Braille display.

00:06:04.312 --> 00:06:07.260
I'll hold up the
Braille display.

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:10.650
On the bottom are
mechanical pins

00:06:10.650 --> 00:06:14.050
that pop up to form
Braille letters.

00:06:14.050 --> 00:06:16.810
And when someone
types on the keyboard,

00:06:16.810 --> 00:06:20.770
it shows up in digital Braille.

00:06:20.770 --> 00:06:23.700
Technology helps
a lot of people.

00:06:23.700 --> 00:06:27.230
And as programmers and
technology developers,

00:06:27.230 --> 00:06:30.040
you really change the lives
of people with disabilities.

00:06:32.570 --> 00:06:37.590
The technology I use
was developed by people.

00:06:37.590 --> 00:06:40.170
And they've changed my
life, and they continue

00:06:40.170 --> 00:06:42.890
to change the lives of others.

00:06:42.890 --> 00:06:45.400
And all of you
here have the power

00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:49.220
to help people, and really
change the lives of people.

00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:56.520
One in four Americans
have a disability

00:06:56.520 --> 00:06:59.140
at some point in their life.

00:06:59.140 --> 00:07:01.780
That's a huge segment
of the population.

00:07:01.780 --> 00:07:03.820
It includes the elderly.

00:07:03.820 --> 00:07:08.400
It includes people who
are born with disabilities

00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:14.450
and people who have experiences,
or temporary disabilities.

00:07:14.450 --> 00:07:17.490
So thinking about
designing technologies

00:07:17.490 --> 00:07:19.570
that will reach
these communities,

00:07:19.570 --> 00:07:23.490
and empower them to gain
access to information,

00:07:23.490 --> 00:07:24.800
it's really, really meaningful.

00:07:27.890 --> 00:07:32.120
There are a variety of assistive
technologies people use.

00:07:32.120 --> 00:07:36.460
Screen readers, are one example.

00:07:36.460 --> 00:07:39.470
Screen readers are
applications that

00:07:39.470 --> 00:07:44.760
convert graphical information
into synthesize speech,

00:07:44.760 --> 00:07:47.640
or digital Braille, like the
Braille display I was holding.

00:07:50.630 --> 00:07:54.730
These serve as bridges that
allow blind individuals

00:07:54.730 --> 00:07:59.140
to access information
on screens.

00:07:59.140 --> 00:08:04.260
So when developers put in
hooks for their products,

00:08:04.260 --> 00:08:07.800
and services to connect
with screen readers,

00:08:07.800 --> 00:08:10.660
blind individuals are
able to gain access

00:08:10.660 --> 00:08:15.890
to online services,
and other products.

00:08:15.890 --> 00:08:20.410
Another feature is
closed captioning.

00:08:20.410 --> 00:08:24.260
Closed captioning are
subtitles on the bottom

00:08:24.260 --> 00:08:29.610
of videos that allow deaf
individuals to access

00:08:29.610 --> 00:08:31.290
the audio content on videos.

00:08:34.659 --> 00:08:37.400
Closed captioning is a feature
that helps the deaf and hard

00:08:37.400 --> 00:08:38.630
of hearing community.

00:08:38.630 --> 00:08:41.429
But it also helps to
other communities.

00:08:41.429 --> 00:08:47.760
Often places will have videos
with the audio turned off,

00:08:47.760 --> 00:08:51.280
and closed captions turned on.

00:08:51.280 --> 00:08:55.300
So little things like that
end up helping everyone.

00:08:55.300 --> 00:08:58.340
Keyboard shortcuts
are helpful for people

00:08:58.340 --> 00:09:02.680
with mobility disabilities
that affect the use of hands.

00:09:02.680 --> 00:09:05.650
But they're also helpful for
people who just plain don't

00:09:05.650 --> 00:09:07.600
like using mice.

00:09:07.600 --> 00:09:10.080
Sometimes it's faster to
use keyboard shortcuts.

00:09:12.470 --> 00:09:16.600
So these are all features
that people have developed,

00:09:16.600 --> 00:09:20.650
that engineers, programmers,
technology developers

00:09:20.650 --> 00:09:24.650
have imagined creating, and
then went through and created,

00:09:24.650 --> 00:09:28.110
and have changed how people
engage with information,

00:09:28.110 --> 00:09:29.250
and engage with each other.

00:09:32.470 --> 00:09:38.870
Technology has revolutionized
all aspects of our lives

00:09:38.870 --> 00:09:44.890
from entertainment, to
reading, to shopping.

00:09:44.890 --> 00:09:50.800
Online shopping has really
impacted the lives of people

00:09:50.800 --> 00:09:55.100
with disabilities in the
area of physical access.

00:09:55.100 --> 00:09:57.740
A lot of stores,
physical stores,

00:09:57.740 --> 00:10:00.120
have physical
barriers, like stairs,

00:10:00.120 --> 00:10:04.220
that make it hard for someone in
a wheelchair to get in and out,

00:10:04.220 --> 00:10:07.850
if there are no
accessible entrances.

00:10:07.850 --> 00:10:12.290
And online shopping gives
people the opportunity

00:10:12.290 --> 00:10:14.450
to bypass those
physical obstacles.

00:10:17.240 --> 00:10:25.380
Chat programs, blogging programs
have allowed many communities

00:10:25.380 --> 00:10:29.430
to start engaging, and having
conversations, that might not

00:10:29.430 --> 00:10:32.690
have otherwise occurred.

00:10:32.690 --> 00:10:36.290
Individuals on the
autism spectrum,

00:10:36.290 --> 00:10:39.930
individuals who are
deaf or hard of hearing,

00:10:39.930 --> 00:10:45.710
are now having conversations,
and connecting, and engaging.

00:10:45.710 --> 00:10:48.250
And programmers, and
technology developers

00:10:48.250 --> 00:10:54.230
who have built these programs,
like Google Hangouts,

00:10:54.230 --> 00:10:57.300
have allowed individuals
in those communities

00:10:57.300 --> 00:11:00.040
to connect, and
share their voices.

00:11:02.920 --> 00:11:08.290
So as developers of technology,
you have a very powerful tool.

00:11:08.290 --> 00:11:13.250
And in some ways, it's
opened many doors.

00:11:13.250 --> 00:11:20.130
The vast majority of websites,
and apps, are not accessible.

00:11:20.130 --> 00:11:22.160
But you can change that.

00:11:22.160 --> 00:11:26.195
It's an incredible gift and
tool that you have to change.

00:11:29.770 --> 00:11:33.560
The process is about
designing products

00:11:33.560 --> 00:11:37.540
from the start with hooks
for assistive technology,

00:11:37.540 --> 00:11:43.430
like screen readers, allowing
for captioning, allowing

00:11:43.430 --> 00:11:45.810
for keyboard shortcuts.

00:11:45.810 --> 00:11:48.900
And when you design it from
the start with those features

00:11:48.900 --> 00:11:52.690
in mind, you're able
to ensure that it's

00:11:52.690 --> 00:11:54.990
going to be accessible.

00:11:54.990 --> 00:11:59.480
Helping people with disabilities
participate in the process

00:11:59.480 --> 00:12:06.080
by allowing for testing at
every stage of development,

00:12:06.080 --> 00:12:08.820
those are ways to
ensure that products

00:12:08.820 --> 00:12:10.950
can help all Americans.

00:12:14.010 --> 00:12:18.720
The challenge is continually
coming up with ways

00:12:18.720 --> 00:12:22.430
to ensure that
people can connect.

00:12:22.430 --> 00:12:24.450
Sometimes it's
really challenging,

00:12:24.450 --> 00:12:26.810
and you get stuck
in a comfort zone

00:12:26.810 --> 00:12:30.090
where you're doing
something just one way.

00:12:30.090 --> 00:12:35.451
And it becomes difficult to
imagine new, exciting ways

00:12:35.451 --> 00:12:36.450
for sharing information.

00:12:39.280 --> 00:12:41.380
But this is Google.

00:12:41.380 --> 00:12:44.630
This is Google, with an
extraordinary mission

00:12:44.630 --> 00:12:47.200
to organize the
information of the world,

00:12:47.200 --> 00:12:49.380
and make it
accessible, and useful.

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:55.660
I'm not a technology developer.

00:12:55.660 --> 00:12:57.760
I'm not a programmer.

00:12:57.760 --> 00:13:01.050
So I don't know all
the technical details

00:13:01.050 --> 00:13:04.160
of the challenges involved.

00:13:04.160 --> 00:13:08.390
But I do know how hard it
is to continue imagining

00:13:08.390 --> 00:13:09.500
new ways of doing things.

00:13:12.640 --> 00:13:15.815
One way I connect with
people is through dance.

00:13:18.330 --> 00:13:21.450
I've been dancing
for about 10 years.

00:13:21.450 --> 00:13:24.340
And because I can't
hear the music,

00:13:24.340 --> 00:13:27.570
and I can't see what my
dance friends are doing,

00:13:27.570 --> 00:13:30.450
I had to come up
with alternative ways

00:13:30.450 --> 00:13:34.290
of experiencing rhythm,
and knowing the dance

00:13:34.290 --> 00:13:38.780
moves by using my hands.

00:13:38.780 --> 00:13:41.560
In over 10 years,
I've come up with lots

00:13:41.560 --> 00:13:44.350
of different techniques
for accessing

00:13:44.350 --> 00:13:48.150
the rhythm, and the movements.

00:13:48.150 --> 00:13:52.050
But I realized that there was
still one very important thing

00:13:52.050 --> 00:13:55.550
that I just wasn't picking up.

00:13:55.550 --> 00:14:01.400
About two weeks ago I was
dancing, and during the dance,

00:14:01.400 --> 00:14:05.100
the guy I was dancing with
raised his hand to his face

00:14:05.100 --> 00:14:09.140
and signed, smiling.

00:14:09.140 --> 00:14:11.750
I felt so surprised.

00:14:11.750 --> 00:14:14.550
He's telling me he's smile?

00:14:14.550 --> 00:14:18.170
What a beautiful thing to
communicate smiling while

00:14:18.170 --> 00:14:19.540
dancing.

00:14:19.540 --> 00:14:22.980
It never occurred to me.

00:14:22.980 --> 00:14:31.070
Smiles are visually available
information to most people.

00:14:31.070 --> 00:14:34.970
And now I know that
when I'm dancing,

00:14:34.970 --> 00:14:39.300
I can tell people-- By the
way, if you're smiling,

00:14:39.300 --> 00:14:45.600
and you want to tell me,
you could sign smiling.

00:14:45.600 --> 00:14:51.570
So sometimes it's challenging to
think of new ways to do things.

00:14:51.570 --> 00:14:54.330
But it's a fun challenge,
and very rewarding.

00:15:00.460 --> 00:15:05.510
And when you come up with new
ways of presenting information,

00:15:05.510 --> 00:15:08.720
you reach more
people, and it moves

00:15:08.720 --> 00:15:12.140
Google closer to its
goal, its mission,

00:15:12.140 --> 00:15:14.490
of gathering the
information, and making

00:15:14.490 --> 00:15:18.460
it accessible, and useful.

00:15:18.460 --> 00:15:21.740
Features that help the
disability community

00:15:21.740 --> 00:15:26.060
often end up helping
the greater community.

00:15:26.060 --> 00:15:28.419
Closed captioning
helps people who

00:15:28.419 --> 00:15:29.585
are deaf or hard of hearing.

00:15:32.310 --> 00:15:37.570
The text associated
with those videos

00:15:37.570 --> 00:15:41.500
serves as a way to
allow for greater,

00:15:41.500 --> 00:15:46.750
more powerful keyword
searches, allowing people

00:15:46.750 --> 00:15:51.250
to access exactly the video,
and information, they want.

00:15:51.250 --> 00:15:54.750
So a feature like closed
captioning, and other assistive

00:15:54.750 --> 00:15:57.950
technologies, end up helping
the greater community.

00:16:03.050 --> 00:16:07.110
I'm really, really
excited to see how we all

00:16:07.110 --> 00:16:09.870
move towards the mission
of making information

00:16:09.870 --> 00:16:13.060
more accessible for everyone.

00:16:13.060 --> 00:16:17.040
About 25 years ago, Congress
passed the Americans

00:16:17.040 --> 00:16:19.800
with Disabilities Act.

00:16:19.800 --> 00:16:24.420
And it represents our country's
belief that everyone's equal,

00:16:24.420 --> 00:16:27.120
and everyone deserves
opportunities in America.

00:16:29.730 --> 00:16:33.060
There are challenges
associated with technology,

00:16:33.060 --> 00:16:38.730
but also, almost
unlimited potential.

00:16:38.730 --> 00:16:43.040
The World Wide Web Consortium
has created resources

00:16:43.040 --> 00:16:45.990
to help with technical
specifics on how

00:16:45.990 --> 00:16:49.230
to make services accessible.

00:16:49.230 --> 00:16:53.300
The Web Content
Accessibility Guidelines 2.0

00:16:53.300 --> 00:16:55.130
is an excellent resource.

00:16:55.130 --> 00:17:00.250
For mobile applications,
the BBC mobile

00:17:00.250 --> 00:17:03.780
accessibility guidelines.

00:17:03.780 --> 00:17:08.060
But also here at Google,
there are many resources,

00:17:08.060 --> 00:17:12.619
and many people, who have this
information of what it takes

00:17:12.619 --> 00:17:15.655
to make services, and
products accessible to people

00:17:15.655 --> 00:17:16.404
with disabilities.

00:17:20.540 --> 00:17:26.700
The disability community wants
to access all the information

00:17:26.700 --> 00:17:33.090
online, wants too access all
the websites and services.

00:17:33.090 --> 00:17:37.170
We want to be part
of the digital world.

00:17:37.170 --> 00:17:42.170
We want to be able to use the
apps in the Google Play Store.

00:17:42.170 --> 00:17:46.230
And later we want
to drive your cars.

00:17:46.230 --> 00:17:47.715
[LAUGHTER]

00:17:49.200 --> 00:17:51.790
I'm excited to see
where Google goes,

00:17:51.790 --> 00:17:54.650
and where we all
go, towards the goal

00:17:54.650 --> 00:17:57.450
of making information
accessible for everyone.

00:18:00.600 --> 00:18:04.090
And now I'll take questions.

00:18:04.090 --> 00:18:05.326
Thank you.

00:18:05.326 --> 00:18:07.826
FEMALE SPEAKER: Just raise your
hand if you have a question.

00:18:07.826 --> 00:18:09.299
[APPLAUSE]

00:18:13.426 --> 00:18:14.800
AUDIENCE: So my
question to Haben

00:18:14.800 --> 00:18:18.100
is, you just came back
from the White House.

00:18:18.100 --> 00:18:22.370
I saw Obama in the photograph,
as well as Joe Biden.

00:18:22.370 --> 00:18:23.680
What was the experience like?

00:18:23.680 --> 00:18:25.645
What did you discuss?

00:18:25.645 --> 00:18:27.020
HABEN GIRMA: It
was unbelievable.

00:18:30.480 --> 00:18:33.030
I went to the White
House in celebration

00:18:33.030 --> 00:18:36.060
of the 25th anniversary
of the Americans

00:18:36.060 --> 00:18:37.940
with Disabilities Act.

00:18:37.940 --> 00:18:40.300
And there were disability
rights advocates

00:18:40.300 --> 00:18:46.170
from all over the country
gathered to celebrate.

00:18:46.170 --> 00:18:52.080
And I gave introductory
remarks before Obama's speech.

00:18:52.080 --> 00:18:54.980
And I met President
Barack Obama,

00:18:54.980 --> 00:18:57.540
and spoke at them briefly.

00:18:57.540 --> 00:19:01.600
And he used the
technology we have here.

00:19:01.600 --> 00:19:04.110
He typed on the
keyboard, and I read

00:19:04.110 --> 00:19:06.520
what he was typing on
the Braille display.

00:19:06.520 --> 00:19:09.660
And I voiced my responses.

00:19:09.660 --> 00:19:13.940
And we talked about
typing, and communication.

00:19:13.940 --> 00:19:16.440
And then I thanked
him for his work

00:19:16.440 --> 00:19:21.410
in helping to increase access
for people with disabilities.

00:19:21.410 --> 00:19:24.020
What are some of
the big commitments

00:19:24.020 --> 00:19:29.260
the US administration has made
for people with disabilities?

00:19:29.260 --> 00:19:34.080
One major thing, the White
House was celebrating on Monday,

00:19:34.080 --> 00:19:38.144
is increased hiring
people with disabilities.

00:19:38.144 --> 00:19:40.060
They're more and more
people with disabilities

00:19:40.060 --> 00:19:44.980
in all areas of government from
working at the White House,

00:19:44.980 --> 00:19:49.070
to working in different
federal agencies.

00:19:49.070 --> 00:19:57.310
In 2010 President Obama and
the Department of Justice

00:19:57.310 --> 00:20:01.460
announced rule
making that they plan

00:20:01.460 --> 00:20:08.400
to release that would set
regulations for website access.

00:20:08.400 --> 00:20:13.410
And those are just
two of the things.

00:20:13.410 --> 00:20:16.550
But there's a lot
that the US has

00:20:16.550 --> 00:20:20.120
been doing to increase access
for people with disabilities,

00:20:20.120 --> 00:20:26.660
both in the physical world, and
in the online, digital world.

00:20:26.660 --> 00:20:28.200
AUDIENCE: Eunice
is asking, do you

00:20:28.200 --> 00:20:30.790
know how the situation
is in other countries?

00:20:30.790 --> 00:20:36.090
How do, for example, non-Latin
people use Braille display?

00:20:36.090 --> 00:20:38.230
HABEN GIRMA: So do I
know about the situation

00:20:38.230 --> 00:20:42.410
in other countries, and
how they use, for example,

00:20:42.410 --> 00:20:44.890
Braille displays?

00:20:44.890 --> 00:20:47.880
There are many different
types of Braille displays,

00:20:47.880 --> 00:20:49.670
and they have the
ability to present

00:20:49.670 --> 00:20:51.235
Braille in other languages.

00:20:54.610 --> 00:20:58.860
So Braille is supported in many
different languages, including

00:20:58.860 --> 00:21:03.170
Spanish, German, and French.

00:21:03.170 --> 00:21:05.320
And when I've
traveled in Europe,

00:21:05.320 --> 00:21:08.620
I've encountered Braille
in other languages.

00:21:08.620 --> 00:21:12.420
Like in Spain, a lot
of things at stores,

00:21:12.420 --> 00:21:17.732
like shampoo bottles, will
have Braille labels in Spanish.

00:21:17.732 --> 00:21:19.660
[LAUGHTER]

00:21:21.470 --> 00:21:26.090
So there are different
things in other countries.

00:21:26.090 --> 00:21:30.770
And every country approaches
access slightly differently.

00:21:30.770 --> 00:21:35.310
In China, for example,
on the sidewalks

00:21:35.310 --> 00:21:39.030
they have raised to
paths, tactile paths

00:21:39.030 --> 00:21:42.200
in the middle of the sidewalk,
so that a blind person

00:21:42.200 --> 00:21:45.070
can feel with
their feet the path

00:21:45.070 --> 00:21:48.020
in the middle of the sidewalk.

00:21:48.020 --> 00:21:55.850
And I believe both China,
and Japan, and Hong Kong,

00:21:55.850 --> 00:22:01.040
have made an effort to have
audio signals at intersections.

00:22:01.040 --> 00:22:04.920
I've also heard Hong Kong
has Braille labels at street

00:22:04.920 --> 00:22:05.900
corners.

00:22:05.900 --> 00:22:07.570
So when you get to
a street corner,

00:22:07.570 --> 00:22:11.590
you can read what
intersection that is.

00:22:11.590 --> 00:22:13.330
Here in the United
States, we have

00:22:13.330 --> 00:22:18.800
a little bit of that in a
few places, but not as much.

00:22:18.800 --> 00:22:21.490
I've also been to Ethiopia.

00:22:21.490 --> 00:22:26.140
And I know that the
University of Addis Ababa

00:22:26.140 --> 00:22:31.580
has a program that supports
students with disabilities.

00:22:31.580 --> 00:22:34.740
And they're working on
getting more technology.

00:22:34.740 --> 00:22:38.400
But there's a huge need
for funding for technology

00:22:38.400 --> 00:22:44.510
like Braille displays, Braille
printers, Braille books.

00:22:44.510 --> 00:22:48.620
So every country has their
own challenges, but also

00:22:48.620 --> 00:22:51.865
their own unique solutions.

00:22:51.865 --> 00:22:53.240
AUDIENCE: The
question is, thanks

00:22:53.240 --> 00:22:54.770
so much for telling
us your story.

00:22:54.770 --> 00:22:56.450
I was wondering if
there are any Google

00:22:56.450 --> 00:22:58.390
products that you like using.

00:22:58.390 --> 00:23:02.290
Also, I was wondering if you
use an iPhone, or Android?

00:23:02.290 --> 00:23:03.778
[LAUGHTER]

00:23:08.750 --> 00:23:11.720
HABEN GIRMA: Great question, RJ.

00:23:11.720 --> 00:23:15.670
So, Google has so many
products and services.

00:23:15.670 --> 00:23:18.540
It's unbelievable.

00:23:18.540 --> 00:23:26.330
And I mentioned chat computer
conversation applications.

00:23:26.330 --> 00:23:31.210
And I've been using
Google Chat, which

00:23:31.210 --> 00:23:33.920
I believe is now
called Google Hangouts,

00:23:33.920 --> 00:23:37.530
for many, many, many years.

00:23:37.530 --> 00:23:41.450
And that has been an amazing way
to connect with people, since I

00:23:41.450 --> 00:23:42.810
can't really hear on the phone.

00:23:46.600 --> 00:23:48.870
A lot of people like
using it, even people

00:23:48.870 --> 00:23:51.836
without disabilities.

00:23:51.836 --> 00:23:54.690
But for me, it's
been an amazing way,

00:23:54.690 --> 00:23:57.760
and I know for other people
with disabilities, people

00:23:57.760 --> 00:24:01.316
with hearing loss, people
on the autism spectrum,

00:24:01.316 --> 00:24:04.430
it's facilitated so
many connections.

00:24:04.430 --> 00:24:07.310
And it has allowed
a lot of communities

00:24:07.310 --> 00:24:09.810
to grow, and connect.

00:24:09.810 --> 00:24:13.445
And then for your last question,
I happen to use an iPhone.

00:24:17.059 --> 00:24:18.850
AUDIENCE: [? Umrit ?]
is typing, hey Haben,

00:24:18.850 --> 00:24:20.380
I have a quick follow up.

00:24:20.380 --> 00:24:25.210
Which Google products
do you not like?

00:24:25.210 --> 00:24:31.540
Which ones could, or
should, be improved?

00:24:31.540 --> 00:24:33.610
HABEN GIRMA: That's an
interesting question,

00:24:33.610 --> 00:24:37.420
and a really good one.

00:24:37.420 --> 00:24:41.544
Thanks for encouraging me
to be honest about that.

00:24:41.544 --> 00:24:42.915
[LAUGHTER]

00:24:44.750 --> 00:24:49.740
So one product that is
actually really, really cool,

00:24:49.740 --> 00:24:52.290
and I would love
to see improved,

00:24:52.290 --> 00:24:55.960
is audio captioning
for YouTube videos.

00:24:55.960 --> 00:25:01.020
The idea is fantastic of
having computers automatically

00:25:01.020 --> 00:25:02.810
caption videos.

00:25:02.810 --> 00:25:05.880
That creates so
many opportunities,

00:25:05.880 --> 00:25:09.360
so many potentials,
for the deaf community,

00:25:09.360 --> 00:25:11.980
but also for the
hearing community,

00:25:11.980 --> 00:25:15.700
to allow for greater
interactivity, greater searches

00:25:15.700 --> 00:25:19.080
for video, and information.

00:25:19.080 --> 00:25:24.140
So improving audio captioning
for YouTube videos.

00:25:24.140 --> 00:25:27.891
It would be great if people
could prioritize that.

00:25:27.891 --> 00:25:29.640
AUDIENCE: The question
is, I was wondering

00:25:29.640 --> 00:25:32.000
if you could tell us a little
more about your experience

00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:34.340
transitioning from
Harvard after being

00:25:34.340 --> 00:25:36.780
in school for many, many years.

00:25:36.780 --> 00:25:41.050
HABEN GIRMA: I graduated from
Harvard Law School in 2013,

00:25:41.050 --> 00:25:45.060
and then immediately started as
a Skadden fellowship attorney

00:25:45.060 --> 00:25:48.850
at Disability Rights Advocates.

00:25:48.850 --> 00:25:55.180
And the transition
was actually not hard,

00:25:55.180 --> 00:25:59.960
because during law school, I
participated in internships.

00:25:59.960 --> 00:26:02.450
And those internships
gave me an idea

00:26:02.450 --> 00:26:07.300
of what to expect
in the work world.

00:26:07.300 --> 00:26:10.340
And because Disability
Rights Advocates

00:26:10.340 --> 00:26:14.400
is all about supporting
people with disabilities,

00:26:14.400 --> 00:26:18.180
it was-- it is a very
supportive environment

00:26:18.180 --> 00:26:21.380
in getting the accommodations
I need for work.

00:26:21.380 --> 00:26:24.630
So we worked out having a
communication assistant who

00:26:24.630 --> 00:26:29.410
would transcribe phone
calls, transcribes meetings,

00:26:29.410 --> 00:26:34.160
and if there were presentations,
or if I go to court,

00:26:34.160 --> 00:26:37.290
and there's hearings,
to get someone

00:26:37.290 --> 00:26:41.165
to type that information, so I
can have captions in Braille.

00:26:43.970 --> 00:26:48.950
So the transition was
helped by the fact

00:26:48.950 --> 00:26:51.570
that I had internship
opportunities

00:26:51.570 --> 00:26:53.950
while I was in law school.

00:26:53.950 --> 00:26:56.710
I'm also from San
Francisco Bay area.

00:26:56.710 --> 00:26:58.740
I grew up in Oakland.

00:26:58.740 --> 00:27:01.760
And my family's still here,
and I had friends here.

00:27:01.760 --> 00:27:06.250
So moving back
here after school,

00:27:06.250 --> 00:27:08.980
I already had a support network.

00:27:08.980 --> 00:27:13.400
So that helped a whole lot.

00:27:13.400 --> 00:27:16.080
AUDIENCE: The first question
out of two questions she has is,

00:27:16.080 --> 00:27:17.840
what do you have
to say to people

00:27:17.840 --> 00:27:20.940
who do not have disabilities,
and who make excuses

00:27:20.940 --> 00:27:23.350
for not following their dreams?

00:27:23.350 --> 00:27:29.700
And her next question
is, do you also Amharic?

00:27:29.700 --> 00:27:34.440
I watched your videos, and
I learned that your parents

00:27:34.440 --> 00:27:39.065
are from Ethiopia, and Eritrea.

00:27:42.240 --> 00:27:45.310
HABEN GIRMA: My family is
from Eritrea, and Ethiopia.

00:27:45.310 --> 00:27:49.560
My mom grew up in Eritrea, and
my dad grew up in Ethiopia.

00:27:49.560 --> 00:27:55.490
And they both speak Amharic,
Tigrinya, and English.

00:27:55.490 --> 00:27:59.130
So growing up, they
taught me English

00:27:59.130 --> 00:28:02.290
so I could succeed in
education, and work.

00:28:02.290 --> 00:28:05.590
They taught me Tigrinya so
that we could talk in public,

00:28:05.590 --> 00:28:07.272
and no one would understand us.

00:28:07.272 --> 00:28:10.050
[LAUGHTER]

00:28:10.050 --> 00:28:12.462
But they saved Amharic
for themselves,

00:28:12.462 --> 00:28:14.670
so they could have secrets,
and I wouldn't understand

00:28:14.670 --> 00:28:15.586
what they were saying.

00:28:18.090 --> 00:28:23.560
So I don't know Amharic, just
a word or two here and there.

00:28:23.560 --> 00:28:33.740
And I think being Eritrean
has helped a lot in my need

00:28:33.740 --> 00:28:36.170
to pursue dreams.

00:28:36.170 --> 00:28:39.890
Eritreans worked hard
fighting for 30 years

00:28:39.890 --> 00:28:42.960
to gain independence
from Ethiopia.

00:28:42.960 --> 00:28:47.920
And I grew up hearing
those stories.

00:28:47.920 --> 00:28:51.590
It doesn't directly have
to do with disabilities,

00:28:51.590 --> 00:28:54.780
but it taught me that
perseverance is important.

00:28:54.780 --> 00:28:59.800
And it's important to keep
trying, even for 30 years.

00:28:59.800 --> 00:29:03.410
So growing up, I didn't
exactly know all the answers

00:29:03.410 --> 00:29:07.040
to how to do things, as
someone who's deaf-blind.

00:29:07.040 --> 00:29:10.840
Often, I was the first
one trying something.

00:29:10.840 --> 00:29:18.480
Harvard University had Helen
Keller almost 100 years ago.

00:29:18.480 --> 00:29:22.245
And back then the technology
we have doesn't exist.

00:29:24.920 --> 00:29:29.720
She's an incredible role model
for pursuing your dreams,

00:29:29.720 --> 00:29:34.910
and doing things even if you
don't have the technology.

00:29:34.910 --> 00:29:39.740
So I knew that one way or
another, I could do it.

00:29:39.740 --> 00:29:43.320
She did it without computers,
without digital Braille.

00:29:43.320 --> 00:29:45.850
So I could absolutely do it.

00:29:45.850 --> 00:29:47.500
I didn't know exactly how.

00:29:47.500 --> 00:29:49.530
She hadn't gone to law school.

00:29:49.530 --> 00:29:51.790
And she hadn't utilized
the technologies

00:29:51.790 --> 00:29:53.720
that are available.

00:29:53.720 --> 00:29:56.845
But I knew I had to try
and make it work somehow.

00:29:59.670 --> 00:30:03.030
And your first
question, Susanna,

00:30:03.030 --> 00:30:07.420
what do I tell people who don't
have disabilities, and yet,

00:30:07.420 --> 00:30:09.770
have excuses for
not doing something?

00:30:12.780 --> 00:30:15.250
You live only once.

00:30:15.250 --> 00:30:18.280
Your dreams are your dreams.

00:30:18.280 --> 00:30:22.460
And if they mean something
to you, keep trying.

00:30:22.460 --> 00:30:24.780
Keep trying to make them happen.

00:30:24.780 --> 00:30:26.860
If it takes 30
years, it's better

00:30:26.860 --> 00:30:31.790
you tried and win after 30
years, then not trying at all.

00:30:31.790 --> 00:30:34.650
If you don't know how you're
going to do something,

00:30:34.650 --> 00:30:36.840
because you're unique,
and your experiences are

00:30:36.840 --> 00:30:41.130
different from others,
take a deep breath,

00:30:41.130 --> 00:30:44.030
and start brainstorming.

00:30:44.030 --> 00:30:46.610
Use the skills that you do have.

00:30:46.610 --> 00:30:51.830
Network with other people, and
get advice from other people.

00:30:51.830 --> 00:30:53.880
Everyone has dreams.

00:30:53.880 --> 00:30:56.605
And it's up to us
to make them happen.

00:30:58.371 --> 00:30:59.997
[LAUGHTER]

00:30:59.997 --> 00:31:01.830
FEMALE SPEAKER: [? Umrit ?]
is letting Haben

00:31:01.830 --> 00:31:04.170
know that her jokes were a hit.

00:31:04.170 --> 00:31:06.660
The whole room was laughing.

00:31:06.660 --> 00:31:08.455
And [? Gopi ?] was
signing with smiles.

00:31:11.850 --> 00:31:14.245
HABEN GIRMA: Thank you.

00:31:14.245 --> 00:31:15.620
FEMALE SPEAKER:
Daniel is typing,

00:31:15.620 --> 00:31:18.310
I'm deaf, functionally
hearing impaired.

00:31:18.310 --> 00:31:21.040
I'm very impressed
with your enunciation.

00:31:21.040 --> 00:31:23.970
My question is, how does
the situation in the US

00:31:23.970 --> 00:31:27.780
compare to other G10
countries in terms

00:31:27.780 --> 00:31:33.070
of disability legislation,
and also good faith

00:31:33.070 --> 00:31:36.970
adherence to the law?

00:31:41.417 --> 00:31:43.500
HABEN GIRMA: That's something
that a lot of people

00:31:43.500 --> 00:31:45.340
have been researching.

00:31:45.340 --> 00:31:51.150
Every community has different
attitudes towards disabilities.

00:31:51.150 --> 00:31:55.290
Some communities celebrate
difference a lot more.

00:31:55.290 --> 00:31:59.820
In China, where the emphasis
is on being the same,

00:31:59.820 --> 00:32:02.570
it's a lot harder
to be different.

00:32:02.570 --> 00:32:06.940
And it's a lot harder
to get accommodations,

00:32:06.940 --> 00:32:12.350
such as interpreters,
captioning, digital Braille.

00:32:12.350 --> 00:32:15.964
But in other cultures, the
individual's uniqueness

00:32:15.964 --> 00:32:16.755
is more celebrated.

00:32:19.480 --> 00:32:24.010
So you asked specifically
about laws and legislation.

00:32:26.600 --> 00:32:31.770
I haven't studied the disability
laws of other countries.

00:32:31.770 --> 00:32:35.230
So I can't offer an
answer to that right now,

00:32:35.230 --> 00:32:37.785
but I'd be happy
to look that up.

00:32:37.785 --> 00:32:39.160
FEMALE SPEAKER:
Kenneth's saying,

00:32:39.160 --> 00:32:41.240
I'm also impressed
with your speech.

00:32:41.240 --> 00:32:43.550
It's usually very
hard for a deaf person

00:32:43.550 --> 00:32:46.410
to learn to speak so well
without audio feedback.

00:32:46.410 --> 00:32:48.605
Can you describe your
own educational process?

00:32:51.180 --> 00:32:53.770
HABEN GIRMA: I will
talk about my education.

00:32:53.770 --> 00:32:55.800
But I also want to
talk about my speech,

00:32:55.800 --> 00:32:57.640
since people seem
to be interested.

00:32:57.640 --> 00:32:58.690
[LAUGHTER]

00:32:59.650 --> 00:33:04.080
So, I identify as deaf-blind.

00:33:04.080 --> 00:33:07.730
And the deaf-blind community
is very, very diverse.

00:33:07.730 --> 00:33:12.850
And that includes everyone
with no vision, and no hearing,

00:33:12.850 --> 00:33:15.420
to a little vision,
and a little hearing.

00:33:15.420 --> 00:33:17.480
And I have a little
bit of hearing

00:33:17.480 --> 00:33:19.790
and a little bit of vision.

00:33:19.790 --> 00:33:23.200
And my low frequency
is terrible.

00:33:23.200 --> 00:33:26.460
I have a really hard time
hearing low frequency sounds.

00:33:26.460 --> 00:33:29.100
Or I just don't
hear them at all.

00:33:29.100 --> 00:33:32.970
High frequency I
can kind of hear.

00:33:32.970 --> 00:33:37.080
And my voice is high frequency.

00:33:37.080 --> 00:33:40.950
And I think I may have
somewhat trained myself

00:33:40.950 --> 00:33:44.140
to speak at a higher
voice to make it easier

00:33:44.140 --> 00:33:46.250
for me to hear myself.

00:33:46.250 --> 00:33:52.270
So that's part of the reason
that I speak the way I speak.

00:33:52.270 --> 00:33:55.010
My education, I grew
up in the Bay Area,

00:33:55.010 --> 00:33:57.720
and I attended
mainstream schools.

00:33:57.720 --> 00:34:01.300
And the school
had a program that

00:34:01.300 --> 00:34:05.180
made sure students who were
blind or students who were deaf

00:34:05.180 --> 00:34:09.120
were taught the skills
they needed to know.

00:34:09.120 --> 00:34:13.190
So I would take my mainstream
courses with other students,

00:34:13.190 --> 00:34:16.210
and then take an hour
each day to learn Braille,

00:34:16.210 --> 00:34:19.480
learn to use
assistive technology,

00:34:19.480 --> 00:34:24.030
learn to use a cane,
learn to do life skills,

00:34:24.030 --> 00:34:26.880
like cooking non-visually.

00:34:26.880 --> 00:34:29.790
It's all about finding
alternative techniques

00:34:29.790 --> 00:34:36.156
that allow you to succeed,
and pursue your dreams.

00:34:36.156 --> 00:34:38.489
FEMALE SPEAKER: Bethany's
saying, your story about dance

00:34:38.489 --> 00:34:39.510
was wonderful.

00:34:39.510 --> 00:34:42.650
What other types of visual,
or oral information,

00:34:42.650 --> 00:34:47.719
would you like to know about
from the physical world?

00:34:47.719 --> 00:34:52.230
HABEN GIRMA: So usually people
will type visual information

00:34:52.230 --> 00:34:53.850
from the physical world.

00:34:53.850 --> 00:34:58.030
So when someone's typing, they
might use an exclamation mark,

00:34:58.030 --> 00:35:02.370
or type colon,
right parentheses,

00:35:02.370 --> 00:35:07.780
or just type S-M-I-L-E.

00:35:07.780 --> 00:35:11.570
Friends will also describe
what someone is wearing,

00:35:11.570 --> 00:35:15.090
or interesting
artwork on the wall.

00:35:15.090 --> 00:35:17.650
Lots of descriptions.

00:35:17.650 --> 00:35:21.360
There's also something
called Pro-Tactile,

00:35:21.360 --> 00:35:25.290
which transfers some of
that information physically.

00:35:25.290 --> 00:35:31.170
So someone could draw smile
on my arm, or signal laughter.

00:35:31.170 --> 00:35:32.920
There's sign language.

00:35:32.920 --> 00:35:35.030
And I could put my
hand on someone's hand

00:35:35.030 --> 00:35:37.660
and feel what they're signing.

00:35:37.660 --> 00:35:42.480
So there's that whole
world of communicating

00:35:42.480 --> 00:35:47.550
visual information in
an alternative format.

00:35:47.550 --> 00:35:49.860
And I knew that.

00:35:49.860 --> 00:35:54.160
But until two weeks ago,
it never occurred to me

00:35:54.160 --> 00:35:56.630
to do that while dancing.

00:35:56.630 --> 00:36:00.110
So for 10 years, people have
been smiling at me on the dance

00:36:00.110 --> 00:36:01.250
floor, and I didn't know.

00:36:01.250 --> 00:36:03.420
[LAUGHTER]

00:36:03.420 --> 00:36:04.980
But I learned.

00:36:04.980 --> 00:36:08.570
And I'm really grateful to have
that additional information.

00:36:08.570 --> 00:36:11.400
And I'm excited to use it
the next time I go dancing.

00:36:11.400 --> 00:36:13.084
[LAUGHTER]

00:36:13.335 --> 00:36:14.710
FEMALE SPEAKER:
Boston says, it's

00:36:14.710 --> 00:36:17.640
really awesome to see Haben
speak for the first time,

00:36:17.640 --> 00:36:18.500
in person.

00:36:18.500 --> 00:36:19.550
He has two questions.

00:36:19.550 --> 00:36:23.500
The first one is, are there any
suites of apps on your iPhone

00:36:23.500 --> 00:36:27.000
that are tailored for
a blind-deaf person?

00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:29.790
And the second is, do you
follow any medical innovations

00:36:29.790 --> 00:36:31.330
that help blind-deaf persons?

00:36:34.320 --> 00:36:38.680
HABEN GIRMA: I feel like I'm
so busy living, and working,

00:36:38.680 --> 00:36:41.530
and dancing, and
talking with friends,

00:36:41.530 --> 00:36:45.950
that I don't have time left
over to follow medical research.

00:36:45.950 --> 00:36:48.870
But I ask friends
and family to let

00:36:48.870 --> 00:36:51.600
me know if they've heard
of something exciting,

00:36:51.600 --> 00:36:53.220
or something new.

00:36:53.220 --> 00:36:55.120
Because I'm open to
new possibilities.

00:36:55.120 --> 00:36:58.470
And I love new research,
and new developments,

00:36:58.470 --> 00:37:01.690
and learning new things.

00:37:01.690 --> 00:37:06.060
I have an app on my
phone called BlindSquare.

00:37:06.060 --> 00:37:09.490
And BlindSquare
is a travel tool.

00:37:09.490 --> 00:37:12.160
And it'll tell you how
to get from point A

00:37:12.160 --> 00:37:16.470
to point B. What's the
nearby intersection?

00:37:16.470 --> 00:37:19.780
What's your approximate address?

00:37:19.780 --> 00:37:24.500
It's designed to be 100%
compatible with a screen reader

00:37:24.500 --> 00:37:26.560
called VoiceOver on the iPhone.

00:37:29.650 --> 00:37:35.910
I would love to have Google Maps
be 100% accessible because that

00:37:35.910 --> 00:37:39.410
has so many features,
and so many potentials.

00:37:39.410 --> 00:37:41.990
But it's not at that level yet.

00:37:41.990 --> 00:37:46.150
So Boston, if you know people
working on Google Maps,

00:37:46.150 --> 00:37:50.330
could you share
this message for me?

00:37:50.330 --> 00:37:54.580
It's actually not that
difficult to make these services

00:37:54.580 --> 00:37:57.000
accessible with screen readers.

00:37:57.000 --> 00:37:59.440
there a guides here at Google.

00:37:59.440 --> 00:38:02.400
So, Google has
accessibility guidelines.

00:38:02.400 --> 00:38:04.210
And there's information
on how to make

00:38:04.210 --> 00:38:06.200
most services accessible.

00:38:06.200 --> 00:38:10.490
I think people maybe
just don't know, and need

00:38:10.490 --> 00:38:15.320
to be reminded, that people
are out there excited to use

00:38:15.320 --> 00:38:20.160
these services, and are
waiting to make them happen.

00:38:20.160 --> 00:38:22.390
Thanks to [? Gopi ?]
for making this happen,

00:38:22.390 --> 00:38:27.042
and, [INAUDIBLE] and
[? Umrit, ?] and Grace.

00:38:27.042 --> 00:38:29.250
FEMALE SPEAKER: Christy was
thanking Haben for coming

00:38:29.250 --> 00:38:31.380
and talking to us today.

00:38:31.380 --> 00:38:34.510
Christy's asking, I have a
family friend who's disabled,

00:38:34.510 --> 00:38:37.670
and studying to be involved
in disability advocacy.

00:38:37.670 --> 00:38:42.914
Do you have any advice
I can pass along to her?

00:38:42.914 --> 00:38:44.580
HABEN GIRMA: It's
really, really helpful

00:38:44.580 --> 00:38:47.010
to connect with the
disability community.

00:38:47.010 --> 00:38:50.070
So when I was thinking
about going into law school,

00:38:50.070 --> 00:38:53.970
I reached out to the blind,
and the deaf community.

00:38:53.970 --> 00:38:56.110
And I talked to a
bunch of deaf lawyers.

00:38:56.110 --> 00:38:58.130
How did you make it
through law school?

00:38:58.130 --> 00:39:00.020
What advice do you have for me?

00:39:00.020 --> 00:39:02.120
And I reached out to
the National Federation

00:39:02.120 --> 00:39:05.560
of the Blind and asked,
all their blind lawyers,

00:39:05.560 --> 00:39:08.940
what advice do you have for
me for going to law school?

00:39:08.940 --> 00:39:10.620
What are the
alternative techniques

00:39:10.620 --> 00:39:13.520
you use for getting your books?

00:39:13.520 --> 00:39:17.380
For doing online research?

00:39:17.380 --> 00:39:20.870
So every disability
experience is very unique.

00:39:20.870 --> 00:39:24.190
So my advice would be connect
with that specific disability

00:39:24.190 --> 00:39:29.130
community, and get advice from
people who have tried that,

00:39:29.130 --> 00:39:34.420
or have done something--
who have done

00:39:34.420 --> 00:39:37.670
something in a related area.

00:39:37.670 --> 00:39:40.020
FEMALE SPEAKER: Sarah's
saying, you've inspired us all.

00:39:40.020 --> 00:39:43.720
You mentioned that Helen Keller
went to Harvard 100 years ago.

00:39:43.720 --> 00:39:45.960
Following your
tremendous success,

00:39:45.960 --> 00:39:49.260
are you seeing more people
that are deaf-blind modeling

00:39:49.260 --> 00:39:50.020
your success?

00:39:50.020 --> 00:39:51.760
Going to Harvard,
and law school?

00:39:54.600 --> 00:39:57.120
HABEN GIRMA: I need to correct
something I said earlier.

00:39:57.120 --> 00:40:02.650
So at the time of Helen
Keller, Harvard, strangely,

00:40:02.650 --> 00:40:05.140
with only men.

00:40:05.140 --> 00:40:10.360
And the equivalent for
women was Radcliffe College.

00:40:10.360 --> 00:40:14.750
Later Harvard opened
its doors to women,

00:40:14.750 --> 00:40:18.760
and Radcliffe College became
part of Harvard University.

00:40:18.760 --> 00:40:22.430
So technically, at the time, it
was called Radcliffe College.

00:40:22.430 --> 00:40:26.140
But it's now part of
Harvard University.

00:40:26.140 --> 00:40:30.070
And more, and more
people with disabilities

00:40:30.070 --> 00:40:36.150
are going to law school,
and are getting educations.

00:40:36.150 --> 00:40:41.650
I don't know of any other
deaf-blind students at Harvard.

00:40:41.650 --> 00:40:44.500
But I do know,
currently, there are

00:40:44.500 --> 00:40:48.870
other blind students, and other
deaf students at Harvard Law

00:40:48.870 --> 00:40:50.270
School.

00:40:50.270 --> 00:40:52.600
And I know of
deaf-blind students

00:40:52.600 --> 00:40:56.750
who are going to other law
schools throughout the country.

00:40:56.750 --> 00:41:00.070
A lot of this is
because the technology,

00:41:00.070 --> 00:41:03.920
and because people like
you are taking the time

00:41:03.920 --> 00:41:07.160
to make sure that services
are accessible to people

00:41:07.160 --> 00:41:09.100
with disabilities.

00:41:09.100 --> 00:41:12.600
I can't imagine trying to have
gone to law school at a time

00:41:12.600 --> 00:41:19.210
without all the services
we now have available.

00:41:19.210 --> 00:41:19.980
So thank you.

00:41:21.780 --> 00:41:24.530
[APPLAUSE]
