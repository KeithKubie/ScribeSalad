literally it was about carbon evaluation
 

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:18.519
literally it was about carbon evaluation
and accounting of biomass and i thought

00:00:18.519 --> 00:00:18.529
and accounting of biomass and i thought
 

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:20.050
and accounting of biomass and i thought
i would actually step back and talk

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:20.060
i would actually step back and talk
 

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:21.159

biofuels and competition and we saw also

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:34.520
biofuels and competition and we saw also
 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:36.340

the agricultural systems and we wanted

00:01:46.929 --> 00:01:46.939
the agricultural systems and we wanted
 

00:01:46.939 --> 00:01:50.469
the agricultural systems and we wanted
to look at it in detail and so these are

00:01:50.469 --> 00:01:50.479
to look at it in detail and so these are
 

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:53.230
to look at it in detail and so these are
just some of the challenges we

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:53.240
just some of the challenges we
 

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:55.959
just some of the challenges we
identified I think many of you are

00:01:55.959 --> 00:01:55.969
identified I think many of you are
 

00:01:55.969 --> 00:02:00.219
identified I think many of you are
probably familiar with these huge

00:02:00.219 --> 00:02:00.229
probably familiar with these huge
 

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:01.809

you probably are less familiar with
 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:08.859
you probably are less familiar with
these issues but it there are there are

00:02:08.859 --> 00:02:08.869
these issues but it there are there are
 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:12.850
these issues but it there are there are
new strains of for example we trust that

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:12.860
new strains of for example we trust that
 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:15.610
new strains of for example we trust that
that if they migrate here to the US

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:15.620
that if they migrate here to the US
 

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:16.160
that if they migrate here to the US
could

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:16.170
could
 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:18.100
could
literally destroy our wheat harvest

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:18.110
literally destroy our wheat harvest
 

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:20.750

there are many other concerns around the

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:20.760
there are many other concerns around the
 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:22.070
there are many other concerns around the
world of emerging pests and pathogens

and it's a constant race just like with

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:24.930
and it's a constant race just like with
 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:27.890

with the environmental footprint of
 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:37.670
with the environmental footprint of
agriculture and of course how do we

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:37.680
agriculture and of course how do we
 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:39.620

climate well I think we'll hear about

00:02:40.729 --> 00:02:40.739
climate well I think we'll hear about
 

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:44.690
climate well I think we'll hear about
some of that work here today and of

US but all around the world and in many
 

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:55.820

ways the world epidemic is worse than

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:55.830
ways the world epidemic is worse than
 

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:58.309
ways the world epidemic is worse than
the one in the US and and then of course

00:02:58.309 --> 00:02:58.319
the one in the US and and then of course
 

00:02:58.319 --> 00:03:00.940

we were talking about preparing for the
 

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:09.740
we were talking about preparing for the

agricultural system for climate change
 

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:13.009
agricultural system for climate change
this was very much in people's minds and

00:04:13.009 --> 00:04:13.019
this was very much in people's minds and
 

00:04:13.019 --> 00:04:14.960
this was very much in people's minds and
the question we asked was very simple is

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:14.970
the question we asked was very simple is
 

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:18.170
the question we asked was very simple is
the agricultural system prepared for

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:18.180
the agricultural system prepared for
 

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:20.300

that much more than any other agency the

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:13.470
that much more than any other agency the
 

00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:15.439
that much more than any other agency the
money at USDA goes to support the

money at USDA goes to support the
 

00:05:15.449 --> 00:05:17.120
money at USDA goes to support the
Agricultural Research Service which is

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:17.130
Agricultural Research Service which is
 

00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:18.770

money here this is very problematic even
worse and there are several other big

worse and there are several other big
 

00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:30.800
worse and there are several other big
internal issues but the money that we

internal issues but the money that we
 

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:34.129
internal issues but the money that we
have been spending within the USDA only

00:05:34.129 --> 00:05:34.139
have been spending within the USDA only
 

00:05:34.139 --> 00:05:36.320

about fifteen percent of it is actually

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:36.330
about fifteen percent of it is actually
 

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:40.250
about fifteen percent of it is actually
competitively awarded now to anybody

00:05:40.250 --> 00:05:40.260

funding this is astounding it's almost

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:47.310
funding this is astounding it's almost
 

00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:48.950
funding this is astounding it's almost
unbelievable and by the way this is

00:05:48.950 --> 00:05:48.960
unbelievable and by the way this is
 

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:51.439
unbelievable and by the way this is
dramatically increased because ten years

00:05:51.439 --> 00:05:51.449
dramatically increased because ten years
 

00:05:51.449 --> 00:05:56.899
dramatically increased because ten years
ago it was only ten percent it's really

00:05:56.899 --> 00:05:56.909
ago it was only ten percent it's really
 

00:05:56.909 --> 00:06:01.129
ago it was only ten percent it's really
extraordinary and this includes the

00:06:01.129 --> 00:06:01.139
extraordinary and this includes the
 

00:06:01.139 --> 00:06:02.600
extraordinary and this includes the
formula funds that are given out to

00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:02.610
formula funds that are given out to
 

00:06:02.610 --> 00:06:04.790
formula funds that are given out to
universities it includes a variety of

00:06:04.790 --> 00:06:04.800
universities it includes a variety of
 

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:06.469
universities it includes a variety of
other things but a very small fraction

00:06:06.469 --> 00:06:06.479
other things but a very small fraction
 

00:06:06.479 --> 00:06:08.180
other things but a very small fraction
of the total research Enterprise is

00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:08.190
of the total research Enterprise is
 

00:06:08.190 --> 00:06:10.580
of the total research Enterprise is
awarded competitively and then the other

00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:10.590
awarded competitively and then the other
 

00:06:10.590 --> 00:06:12.439
awarded competitively and then the other
point is that the public sector is

00:06:12.439 --> 00:06:12.449
point is that the public sector is
 

00:06:12.449 --> 00:06:14.810
point is that the public sector is
spending about a third of the public

00:06:14.810 --> 00:06:14.820
spending about a third of the public
 

00:06:14.820 --> 00:06:18.529
spending about a third of the public
plant research on just five crops and

00:06:18.529 --> 00:06:18.539
plant research on just five crops and
 

00:06:18.539 --> 00:06:20.180
plant research on just five crops and
they're felt we felt that there was a

00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:20.190
they're felt we felt that there was a
 

00:06:20.190 --> 00:06:21.950
they're felt we felt that there was a
huge overlap with what industry was

00:06:21.950 --> 00:06:21.960
huge overlap with what industry was
 

00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:23.719
huge overlap with what industry was
doing and that there was sort of a

00:06:23.719 --> 00:06:23.729
doing and that there was sort of a
 

00:06:23.729 --> 00:06:25.219
doing and that there was sort of a
question of what is the federal role

00:06:25.219 --> 00:06:25.229
question of what is the federal role
 

00:06:25.229 --> 00:06:27.589
question of what is the federal role
versus the private sector role the chief

00:06:27.589 --> 00:06:27.599
versus the private sector role the chief
 

00:06:27.599 --> 00:06:31.820
versus the private sector role the chief

00:06:31.830 --> 00:06:34.580
scientist from one of the large grain
companies basically said to us we really

00:06:34.580 --> 00:06:34.590
companies basically said to us we really
 

00:06:34.590 --> 00:06:37.100
companies basically said to us we really
don't need them to fund corn genetics we

00:06:37.100 --> 00:06:37.110
don't need them to fund corn genetics we
 

00:06:37.110 --> 00:06:39.890
don't need them to fund corn genetics we
have two thousand corn geneticists so

00:06:39.890 --> 00:06:39.900
have two thousand corn geneticists so
 

00:06:39.900 --> 00:06:41.940
have two thousand corn geneticists so
let me just conclude because

00:06:41.940 --> 00:06:41.950
let me just conclude because
 

00:06:41.950 --> 00:06:46.320
let me just conclude because
six minutes and 40 seconds we we

00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:46.330
six minutes and 40 seconds we we
 

00:06:46.330 --> 00:06:50.340
six minutes and 40 seconds we we
basically ended a report on a challenge

00:06:50.340 --> 00:06:50.350
basically ended a report on a challenge
 

00:06:50.350 --> 00:06:52.320
basically ended a report on a challenge
and I think an optimistic note because

00:06:52.320 --> 00:06:52.330
and I think an optimistic note because
 

00:06:52.330 --> 00:06:53.970
and I think an optimistic note because
politically we really had to get the

00:06:53.970 --> 00:06:53.980
politically we really had to get the
 

00:06:53.980 --> 00:06:56.220
politically we really had to get the
support of the USDA for these changes

00:06:56.220 --> 00:06:56.230
support of the USDA for these changes
 

00:06:56.230 --> 00:06:58.200
support of the USDA for these changes
but from the perspective of Harvard let

00:06:58.200 --> 00:06:58.210
but from the perspective of Harvard let
 

00:06:58.210 --> 00:07:00.990
but from the perspective of Harvard let
me just say this the morel act for the

00:07:00.990 --> 00:07:01.000
me just say this the morel act for the
 

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:02.880
me just say this the morel act for the
last hundred and fifty years did

00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:02.890
last hundred and fifty years did
 

00:07:02.890 --> 00:07:04.170
last hundred and fifty years did
something very important for this

00:07:04.170 --> 00:07:04.180
something very important for this
 

00:07:04.180 --> 00:07:07.770
something very important for this
country and led to huge innovations and

00:07:07.770 --> 00:07:07.780
country and led to huge innovations and
 

00:07:07.780 --> 00:07:09.990
country and led to huge innovations and
made the US the agricultural leader in

00:07:09.990 --> 00:07:10.000
made the US the agricultural leader in
 

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:12.210
made the US the agricultural leader in
research for the world but the next

00:07:12.210 --> 00:07:12.220
research for the world but the next
 

00:07:12.220 --> 00:07:13.290
research for the world but the next
hundred and fifty years are going to

00:07:13.290 --> 00:07:13.300
hundred and fifty years are going to
 

00:07:13.300 --> 00:07:15.210
hundred and fifty years are going to
look different and we need to bring

00:07:15.210 --> 00:07:15.220
look different and we need to bring
 

00:07:15.220 --> 00:07:17.700
look different and we need to bring
agriculture back out of the land grants

00:07:17.700 --> 00:07:17.710
agriculture back out of the land grants
 

00:07:17.710 --> 00:07:19.920
agriculture back out of the land grants
into all of the universities to the

00:07:19.920 --> 00:07:19.930
into all of the universities to the
 

00:07:19.930 --> 00:07:21.810
into all of the universities to the
places where the most exciting biology

00:07:21.810 --> 00:07:21.820
places where the most exciting biology
 

00:07:21.820 --> 00:07:23.850
places where the most exciting biology
the most exciting physics is going on

00:07:23.850 --> 00:07:23.860
the most exciting physics is going on
 

00:07:23.860 --> 00:07:25.860
the most exciting physics is going on
and there's been a balkanization in this

00:07:25.860 --> 00:07:25.870
and there's been a balkanization in this
 

00:07:25.870 --> 00:07:27.900
and there's been a balkanization in this
country where we've seen agricultural

00:07:27.900 --> 00:07:27.910
country where we've seen agricultural
 

00:07:27.910 --> 00:07:29.700
country where we've seen agricultural
research at the land grants even in the

00:07:29.700 --> 00:07:29.710
research at the land grants even in the
 

00:07:29.710 --> 00:07:31.230
research at the land grants even in the
few institutions that have excellent

00:07:31.230 --> 00:07:31.240
few institutions that have excellent
 

00:07:31.240 --> 00:07:33.600
few institutions that have excellent
science departments and agricultural

00:07:33.600 --> 00:07:33.610
science departments and agricultural
 

00:07:33.610 --> 00:07:36.240
science departments and agricultural
sciences they tend to be isolated in

00:07:36.240 --> 00:07:36.250
sciences they tend to be isolated in
 

00:07:36.250 --> 00:07:37.500
sciences they tend to be isolated in
different parts of campus like in

00:07:37.500 --> 00:07:37.510
different parts of campus like in
 

00:07:37.510 --> 00:07:41.580
different parts of campus like in
Wisconsin so what I really love to see

00:07:41.580 --> 00:07:41.590
Wisconsin so what I really love to see
 

00:07:41.590 --> 00:07:43.410
Wisconsin so what I really love to see
today is all of this activity going on

00:07:43.410 --> 00:07:43.420
today is all of this activity going on
 

00:07:43.420 --> 00:07:45.270
today is all of this activity going on
at Harvard we are not a land-grant

00:07:45.270 --> 00:07:45.280
at Harvard we are not a land-grant
 

00:07:45.280 --> 00:07:47.070
at Harvard we are not a land-grant
institution and yet every institution

that has excellent science excellent
social science needs to be thinking

00:07:52.230 --> 00:07:52.240
social science needs to be thinking
 

00:07:52.240 --> 00:07:54.240
social science needs to be thinking
