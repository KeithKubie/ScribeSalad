00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:01.140
All right, Michael.

00:00:01.140 --> 00:00:06.130
So I'm going to deal with your request
by trying to go through an exercise

00:00:06.130 --> 00:00:09.170
with you, where we try to figure out
what these options are, and there's

00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:13.800
going to be a secret point here that
has to do as always with abstraction.

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:14.450
So here's what to do.

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:17.885
So we've got the same little grid
world that we had before up here but

00:00:17.885 --> 00:00:19.930
I've introduced another grid world.

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:22.490
Do you recognize this grid world?

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:25.340
&gt;&gt; It looks like a very tiny,
little game of Pac Man.

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:28.260
&gt;&gt; It is exactly a tiny,
little game of Pac Man.

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:32.860
So what I want to do with this tiny,
little game of Pac Man,

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:36.350
which again is just a grid world, is I
want to explore this notion of options

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:38.750
and see what we can
figure out about them.

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:40.620
So everybody remembers Pac Man.

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:43.430
So Michael, for the benefit of the
audience that has never played Pac Man,

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:46.960
all zero of them, why don't you
explain to us how Pac Man works.

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:52.428
&gt;&gt; Sure, so in the game where
a little Jewish guy named Pac Man and

00:00:52.428 --> 00:00:56.200
we're running around in the grid, we're
the yellow guy and we chomp, chomp,

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:57.290
chomp, chomp, chomp.

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:58.840
We can't go through the blue walls.

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:04.587
We're being pursued by [LAUGH]
it looks like a sort of-

00:01:04.587 --> 00:01:05.423
&gt;&gt; Careful.

00:01:05.423 --> 00:01:05.976
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:01:05.976 --> 00:01:11.410
[LAUGH] I'm going to go with
the french fry goblins from McDonald's.

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:15.569
So as we move around in the grid,
we consume those little dots,

00:01:15.569 --> 00:01:18.478
little pellet's, and
that gives us points.

00:01:18.478 --> 00:01:22.849
If we can actually clear all the little
dots and the big dots from the screen,

00:01:22.849 --> 00:01:25.787
then we have successfully
completed the screen and

00:01:25.787 --> 00:01:28.980
we get an even more
exciting challenge next.

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:29.640
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:34.210
&gt;&gt; But I want to say that there's one
other important thing is that if we

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:36.590
eat one of those power pellet's,
the big fat dots,

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:42.450
then the tables are turned
on our ghost friends.

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:45.600
And we can actually,
if we touch them, consume them.

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:46.360
We get points.

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:51.132
And then they have to, I believe their
eyeballs run away and regenerate.

00:01:51.132 --> 00:01:53.210
&gt;&gt; Yes, that's exactly what happens,
just like in real life.

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.840
So, yeah.

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:55.790
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; So the ghosts touch us, we die,

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:59.540
unless we've had the power pellet's, and
then they allow us to eat the ghost but

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:02.498
only for limited amount of time,
that doesn't last forever.

00:02:02.498 --> 00:02:06.240
Once I get a big fat pellet, I don't
get to do it for the rest of the game

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:09.419
it last for some amount of time which-
&gt;&gt; For limited time only.

00:02:09.419 --> 00:02:10.470
&gt;&gt; Limited time only.

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:14.220
And I don't remember if that time
is fixed or that time is random,

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:16.870
I think it's fixed but maybe not.

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:20.270
And there are different versions of Pac
Man that have slightly different rules,

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:21.630
but those are the basic rules.

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:23.578
So, here's the exercise
I want to go through.

00:02:23.578 --> 00:02:27.070
Now obviously, and when I say obvious,
I'm saying that to beat down anyone

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:30.900
who doesn't think it's obvious,
there are four atomic actions, left,

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:32.780
right, up and down,
north, south, east and

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:37.080
west just like in any other grid world,
and that's pretty much what we're given.

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:39.520
So here's the exercise I
want you to go through.

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:43.990
It's got sort of two parts to it and
this is actually an exercise that we

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:47.240
have done with other people as
a part of studies we've done.

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:52.000
I want you to think about options
that you might create here.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.170
If you were going to
describe to a human being,

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:58.930
here are the things you
need to accomplish,

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:03.280
here are the things you need to do
in this game in order to play it and

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:07.200
play it well presumably, what kind
of action would you come up with?

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:09.580
So, I'm asking you do the same thing
that I asked you to do before.

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:14.093
Where you said, well go to the doorway,
and you know that kind of thing.

00:03:14.093 --> 00:03:16.120
So, I'm asking you do the same
thing here but in Pac Man land.

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:18.320
&gt;&gt; Sure, I can give that a try.

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:22.140
I mean, I feel like in some ways this is
is harder than the other example because

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:25.546
it was nice to be able to just
navigate to that plus one and

00:03:25.546 --> 00:03:28.060
know that our task was complete.

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:30.690
Here, there's a lot of things going on.

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:35.190
&gt;&gt; Yeah, but you have to simplify it for
me and so abstract away.

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:35.870
Simplify it for me.
