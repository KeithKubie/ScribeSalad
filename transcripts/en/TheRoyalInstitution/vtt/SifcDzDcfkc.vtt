[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:16.966 --> 00:00:35.928
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:35.928 --> 00:00:39.330
The human volcano,
fire breathing--

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:41.870
it's the most dangerous stunt
in the fire eater's

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:43.120
repertoire.

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:47.010
But how does it work?

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:51.140
Well, it all hinges on the
oxygen in the air.

00:00:51.140 --> 00:01:01.590
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:04.790
When I'm breathing fire, all
that's happening is I'm

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:07.830
burning a fuel by blowing
it over a flame.

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.820
So here's my fuel, and
here is my flame--

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:18.440
not very spectacular.

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:20.140
So what's going on?

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:23.220
Well, in order to burn, a fuel
needs to be mixed with the

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:25.100
oxygen in the air.

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:28.130
And at the moment, this fuel
doesn't have enough oxygen

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:30.330
mixed with it in order
for that to happen.

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:32.880
This fuel's not very volatile.

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:36.490
This fuel, however, is very
volatile, which means it

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:37.940
evaporates constantly.

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:40.590
It's evaporating more quickly,
and it's mixing with the air

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.070
all the time.

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:43.320
So let's see what happens.

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:52.650
So you might think that
this fuel would be

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:54.100
ideal for fire breathing.

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:56.130
It burns really, really well.

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:58.470
In fact, it burns
a bit too well.

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:01.120
If I use this for fire
breathing, the flame could

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:04.910
jump back to my mouth, and I'd
be in serious trouble.

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:07.410
So it's actually this
fuel that I use.

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:10.030
But in order for it to burn,
I have to mix it

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:11.490
with the air myself.

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:14.820
And to do that, I spray the
fuel in a fine, fine

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:16.070
mist over the flame.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.400
So what's so special
about oxygen?

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:24.620
Well, in fact, oxygen is really,
really reactive.

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:26.260
It wants to react with
other things

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:28.180
to produce new products.

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:30.850
And, in fact, burning is just
the name we give to the

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:34.340
chemical reaction between
oxygen and a fuel.

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:37.540
Now, the fuel we've got here is
a hydrocarbon, which means

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:40.280
it just contains hydrogen
and carbon.

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:44.340
And when we react this with
oxygen, it produces carbon

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:46.830
dioxide and water.

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:48.390
So we've got the fuel.

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:49.670
We've got the oxygen.

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:51.660
There's one thing missing.

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:54.270
In order to get the reaction
going, we need to provide it

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:55.870
with some energy.

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:58.540
And with fire breathing, that
energy comes from the

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:01.290
flame on the torch.

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:04.150
Now once that reaction's
started, it provides its own

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:07.090
energy and forms a kind
of chain reaction.

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:10.581
Now, the end product of this
is a giant fire ball.

00:03:10.581 --> 00:03:14.185
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:03:14.185 --> 00:03:17.190
And just because I know how that
happens doesn't make it

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:19.380
any less terrifying
when it does.

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:46.880
