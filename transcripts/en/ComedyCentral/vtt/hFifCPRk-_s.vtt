Our lovely and honorable
#PointsMe winner Richard

00:00:12.978 --> 00:00:15.014
is new here to Hollywood,
but, uh... as you might be able

00:00:15.047 --> 00:00:16.749
to tell from the fact
that he's not currently made

00:00:16.782 --> 00:00:19.085
of green juice.
But he will soon learn

00:00:19.118 --> 00:00:20.620
that Hollywood
is an awkward place,

00:00:20.653 --> 00:00:22.021
which is why our speed game
tonight is

00:00:22.054 --> 00:00:23.689
Cringeworthy: Hollywood Edition,

00:00:23.722 --> 00:00:26.559

in 60 seconds. And begin.
