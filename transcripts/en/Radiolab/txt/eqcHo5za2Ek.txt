Speaker 1:          00:00          Alright. Hey guys, sorry. Hey, we're here now. Hey, Peter. Simon, Simon, how are you man? I'm doing well. And Yourself? Good.

Speaker 2:          00:07          Okay. Uh, who's who? Um, Peter is a DJ. Peter Rosenberg from hot 97. Simon Adler is the journalist. Our Pal Andrew Moran from the New Yorker is also in the room and Robert and ironman.

Speaker 1:          00:18          Good. Well, uh, we have all gathered here today to talk about, uh, the wonderful world of professional wrestling,

Speaker 3:          00:25          my favorite world.

Speaker 2:          00:30          So yes, we're going to talk about professional wrestling for the first half of the show. And we realize there's probably a lot of you out there listening right now who are like,

Speaker 4:          00:36          seriously guys, there are people like, oh wait, you're 35 years old. Do you love wrestling? It's, you know, I get this a lot if I'm tweeting about it a lot, I get tweets that go, you know, it's fake, right? It's like, we'll do I write you that when you tweet about your favorite movie, it's entertainment. The awesome thing about wrestling is, is that there are these random things that are a little bit real.

Speaker 1:          00:57          And sometimes those moments of realness can just be like

Speaker 3:          01:00          Paul [inaudible].

Speaker 2:          01:05          They can change everything.

Speaker 3:          01:07          Oh,

Speaker 2:          01:09          now if you're like me and you grew up in the 80s, a, you might remember wrestling is like, you know how Kogan versus Andre the giant, these epic matchups, they were kind of great but also sort of ridiculous and cartoonish. Well, according to Peter Rosenberg, there was a moment where wrestling started to sort of tinker with reality and a much more nuanced and a fascinating way. In fact, you could argue that pro wrestling became a reinstate the creation of the Baroque movement of the 16th century. But the postmodern twist you get, I know people who would.

Speaker 1:          01:40          Okay, you're going to meet him. I'm Chad. I'm Robert. This is Radiolab. And uh, according to Peter, this whole thing's where we're going to start. This whole thing goes back to this moment called the Montreal screw job. The Montreux screw job was above anything else that had ever happened or that will ever probably ever happen again because it was odor, reality transpiring right there in the ring. I mean, it was when real life just came and tore a hole

Speaker 3:          02:09          in the fiction.

Speaker 1:          02:13          That guy you just heard is David Shoemaker. I write about professional wrestling for Grantland and the guy you're about to hear is journalists, Simon Adler. He will take the story from here. Okay, so the moment in question really centers around this one guy named Brett

Speaker 5:          02:30          [inaudible] red. They hit man heart. Brett Hart is seen by many to be the greatest entering performer of all time. He was one of the good guys.

Speaker 3:          02:41          That's the room, the [inaudible] business.

Speaker 5:          02:46          They call him a baby face. Is that what you call the good guys? The good guy in wrestling. He's a baby face. He was my favorite wrestler as a kid. I didn't understand why at the time, but now I do. It's because he did so

Speaker 4:          03:00          well and in that era, the mid to late eighties when I fell in love with him. So many guys were just big and hawking and a little bit clumsy. But Brett did the kind of work that you could show to someone who's, who's never watched wrestling. I think they could see the art in it and I think they could see how it's, it's like ballet or a million other arts

Speaker 6:          03:22          forms. What he means. And you can kind of see this when you watch old Brett Hart matches on youtube. He's a gliding through the air, bouncing off the mat, off the ropes here,

Speaker 4:          03:36          tell stories brilliantly within the way he, uh, executes a map.

Speaker 6:          03:41          The wrestling is scripted, but there's a lot of improv going on there. The set beads, he knew how to take those moments and in that Improv make you think, oh shoot, he's about to lose. And then

Speaker 3:          03:57          [inaudible]

Speaker 6:          03:57          he was a natural born wrestler,

Speaker 7:          04:00          you know, his father was a, was a legendary wrestler, his brother, Owen legendary wrestler. He comes from, um, this Canadian wrestling royalty

Speaker 8:          04:10          kid. Growing up, I had the ability to watch the, uh, or had the fortune of watch these varied wrestling styles and techniques and stuff.

Speaker 6:          04:20          That's Brett Hart in an interview in 2000 on fresh air. And he says that some of his earliest memories as a kid were these massive dudes showing up to his house and hanging out in his basement with his dad.

Speaker 8:          04:32          You know, even then my dad was, you know, I'll say 60,

Speaker 6:          04:35          who's teaching them how to be wrestlers,

Speaker 8:          04:37          pull on these old wooly tights. And then he would wrestle with these guys. And he would literally, um, put them in wrestling, holds these submission wrestling holds, which is his obsession. And uh, he would torture these big huge football players for hours and they would scream literally these high pitched screams. It was terrifying. I'd be upstairs in the room above it and as I got older, I would go down and actually venture into the room and sit on the bench and watch. And uh, he would sometimes these wrestlers would run out when my dad finally let them go. They'd actually run out, tear out of the, out the doorway and out the outside, sometimes in the snow and run out the, in their bare feet. And you, and even seeing them again,

Speaker 4:          05:14          I mean there's a legendary, so many legendary stories about the Hart family, but you, you know, my favorite among many is, uh, the bear that lived in their backyard during the summers because at the time, wrestling a bear was a thing that would actually happen from time to time. No, really. And, uh, Brett tells a story in his, his book, um, about, you know, just sitting there and letting the bear lick his toes. I mean, like this is, this is a life that they, that he lived and he was, he was so in, it was so ingrained in him.

Speaker 9:          05:47          Um,

Speaker 7:          05:47          so in the early eighties, Brett was working for his dad's company up in Canada. And while that's going on in Canada, there's this guy, Vince McMahon, back in the u s who is building kind this wrestling empire. It basically, he's buying up all of these small promoters from across the country and eventually goes up into Canada and buys out breads, dad's company.

Speaker 8:          06:07          I bought it in 1984. They paid him a certain amount of money to stop running. Like, just to kind of go out of business. And then they took on, uh, some of his better wrestlers at the time, which was myself and I had a couple of brother-in-laws.

Speaker 6:          06:21          And shortly thereafter,

Speaker 3:          06:23          Jared,

Speaker 6:          06:25          the WWF comes under fire,

Speaker 10:         06:28          how Kogan and other world wrestling federation stars have taken the offensive against accusation that many have been steroid abuser, like man red to widespread steroid abused in the world wrestling federation. So

Speaker 7:          06:40          there's this big steroid crisis. Vince has to deal with all of this litigation and he kind of needs to rebrand his organization. He needs a new good guy, a new champion, a new baby face. And he looks to Brett for that

Speaker 6:          06:56          for a couple of reasons. According to David Shoemaker. One is that he's a traditionalist, sort of a throwback to an earlier time too. He's not that big. So when you see him, you don't think steroids guys, definitely, yeah. Roid rage. And so he saw all that in Brett Hart. So during the 90s, Vince makes Brett a really big star.

Speaker 3:          07:15          Hey Scott,

Speaker 11:         07:20          face of the company, I mean he was on the Simpsons. He was a really, really big star. You know, there are people who criticize Brett for saying he wasn't that fun or he took himself too seriously, but he was a serious worker. He took wrestling very seriously for myself, really fighting hard to actually survive and come out of it. Actually to come out of the wrestling profession someday as a, as a success rather than a wrestling tragedy, which is what so many of them turn out.

Speaker 6:          07:50          Okay. So fast forward to 1995, 1996 at the time, a major rivalry was starting between the WWF that is Vince McMahon's company and the WCW, um, which was ted Turner's company, Ted Turner and Gillian Air. And one of his big tactics is I'm just going to start buying all of the wrestlers from the WWF, from Vince McMahon's organization. So he's offering them more money. He's offering them longer contracts, and he was just like flooding it with money to steal all the stars from WWF. And then in late 1996, Brett got an offer. Turner really went in for the kill from WCW. That was huge. Two point $8 million.

Speaker 3:          08:30          I mean you have to show us the common sense, you know, first of all, you've got to do what's right for your family, but I mean, how much money do you need? Sometimes I find myself torn between trying to do the right thing for my family and at the same time show my loyalties.

Speaker 6:          08:42          That's a clip of Brett talking in a documentary that was being filmed at the time called wrestling with shadows, which is fantastic. The filmmaker Paul Jay was nice enough to let us play some clips. In any case, Brett gets this offer and he's got kind of terrible decision

Speaker 1:          08:56          to make because Vince gave him a lot. You know, he really gave him his life and initially Brett decides there's no way I'm going to leave. You know? I think my relationship was with Vince McMahon was always sort of like a father and I sort of saw myself. If I left, it would have been a little bit like leaving my dad, especially when the shifts are down. He really did see Vince as a father figure.

Speaker 6:          09:20          So Brett goes to Vince and basically says, convince me to stay.

Speaker 1:          09:23          They went back and forth. There was conversation about him signing a longterm deal, a 20 year deal with WWF. Not for as much money, but for guaranteed security.

Speaker 6:          09:32          Vince said, I can't afford to pay you that.

Speaker 8:          09:36          Just talk to Vince

Speaker 1:          09:39          in the documentary. Brett and his wife, they're sitting at a kitchen table.

Speaker 8:          09:43          Let me see. He goes, nobody wants bread. Heart more than Minspeck, man, you can't afford to compete with Turner. He was Turner's hell bent on trying to put him out of business. I got to think about everything. I got to think about everything. Just see what makes sense. Call Eric, maybe. How can we cut this off now for a little while? Okay.

Speaker 1:          10:11          Ultimately it became clear that Brett would have to go take the money. I can't help but feel really heartbroken and disappointed that um,

Speaker 8:          10:24          that I left this company.

Speaker 3:          10:26          Yeah.

Speaker 10:         10:30          So this really gets to the heart of it. Once Brett decides he's going to leave, they have to figure out how, how are they going to make his exit? This is really the pivotal question behind all of this.

Speaker 1:          10:44          Yeah. You know that it's a very, very delicate situation. That's Vince. So, and this was sort of his problem to solve because he worked for Vince McMahon, you know, you could say I was his right hand man because I was writing the show. He was part of the team that scripted, who would win, who would lose, how it would happen, you know? I mean, I was literally putting this show on paper, you know, once a week. Wait, why is this a hard question? I mean, can he just pick up and leave? Well, because he's the champion. He has the belt, the physical belt, the giant golden like belt buckle thing, and that belt is the symbol of the company and everybody in it, everybody working behind the scenes, everybody who was trying to support their family, that belt was a representation of all that. That the worst thing that could happen is your champion walking away with the belt, drilling up to the new company, holding up the championship from the old company

Speaker 6:          11:35          where they could just defile it if they wanted to. That was not an option for Vince McMahon. This isn't a perfect comparison, but the closest thing I've come up to in my mind is it would be like Lebron James quitting his contract with Nike and then showing up in an Adidas and taking a piss into a pair of Nike's. So you know Vince, at the end of the day, he just had to get that belt off of bread. So their initial thought, their first plan was probably the simplest option. There was a match coming up, this big event of pay per view event in Montreal. Brett being the champion of the company, he should just lose to the number two guy in the company, Shawn Michaels. Vince loved Sean. I mean really thought Sean was a mega star, which was right about clearly Sean was next in line. So they pitched this idea to Brett and Brett was like, I can't do that. For one he thinks Shawn's an idiot.

Speaker 5:          12:31          It's got this premadonna personality. I mean he thinks he's better than everyone else and is something very arrogant and I'm noxious about him because he was, he was a showman. He would hump the ring just like do ridiculous things. And like

Speaker 6:          12:43          Brett. Shaun was the triumph of style over substance. Also, you're asking Brett to wrap up his career in the WWE with a loss in Montreal in Canada where he is a national hero.

Speaker 5:          12:55          I described the events. I just assume blow my brains out. It would be the same once you're asking me to do from a character standpoint, that's what I would be doing. Breadth to hit hitman hardwood. Blow his brains out.

Speaker 3:          13:07          Yeah.

Speaker 5:          13:07          Oh, the whole thing's been hard. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          13:10          Okay.

Speaker 5:          13:19          Day of the match. Still nothing has been decided as to how the match is going to end. Brett is backstage and eventually he goes to Vince to have a conversation. Right. I gotta just talk the documentary crews filming all of this and at this point Vince says, no, I don't want any cameras in here. Get those out of here. And so Brett actually ends up wearing a wire to document the conversation that's about to happen.

Speaker 12:         13:42          I never ever wanted to leave here with any kind of bad feeling, but this week has been a bad week for me. I feel kind of betrayed a little bit. Well, I go to a little bit and again, all we're talking about really is Turner, Gosh, what's coming between you and me and that's all. I can't tell you how appreciative I will always be for everything you've done. I didn't want to leave with any problems. I actually didn't want to leave it all and then it's the point where there was no other choice but to go the way this whole thing has been depicted. It's really hard for me as a hero here to come up short this weekend. What would you want to do today then? I'm open to new. I think what I'd like to do is get through today. I think tomorrow is you just go in and do my,

Speaker 6:          14:18          so Brett suggest that this ends in a disqualification. Usually what that means is something called a Shmata Moz or whatever you want. Typically in a Schmaltz, the ring is just flooded with a bunch of wrestlers and chaos into is the referee usually is thrown out of the ring and it ends in some sort of draw. Bret would then appear on Monday night raw the next day and turn over the belt. That is what he planned on doing too. That way he could turn over the belt but not lose. Exactly. And eventually Vince says, okay, fine.

Speaker 12:         14:49          Nah, I ain't got, I'm opening to, like I

Speaker 3:          14:52          said before on the term wind up and now Milton Bradley, they're like chronic karate fighters by 1997 survivors. Sherry.

Speaker 5:          15:05          Okay, here we go. So survivor's series, 1997

Speaker 3:          15:11          [inaudible]

Speaker 5:          15:15          oh, the drama. So around 9:20 PM 20,000 people in the stands, countless television screens across the country. Shawn Michaels comes

Speaker 3:          15:27          and he,

Speaker 5:          15:29          he comes out singing his own theme themes. I think I'm cute. I know I'm sexy. It's singing karaoke style. It's prerecorded of him singing. That's an approach. Yeah, he's got his hair in a ponytail. He's wearing his trademark black spandex pants, but hearts all over them like he is the manifestation of everything that Brett despises. And then outcomes. Bret Harte waving a Canadian flag

Speaker 3:          15:59          20

Speaker 5:          16:00          and he walks into the ring to gets in, takes off the championship belt, hands it to the ref and before the match even officially begin.

Speaker 3:          16:07          Okay.

Speaker 5:          16:12          Shawn flies at Brett and just starts [inaudible].

Speaker 3:          16:18          Yep.

Speaker 5:          16:20          Sean and Brett. They're going at each other

Speaker 3:          16:23          with assertive

Speaker 5:          16:24          like real ferocity pretty quick. They're outside the ring.

Speaker 3:          16:32          Right.

Speaker 5:          16:33          Kicks up. Shawn chucks him over the security railing into the crowd.

Speaker 3:          16:38          It didn't, no.

Speaker 5:          16:41          Then there's this moment where Brett picks Sean up so that Sean's legs are straight up in the air and then

Speaker 3:          16:47          right. Just slams him on his back in all of this.

Speaker 5:          16:57          Yeah. Everything I know about it is like they're following the, the narrative arc, but like they know, okay, we're going to fight her out outside the ring for a while and, and then x, y, z will happen and so eventually

Speaker 3:          17:10          Brett throws Shawn back into the room and then

Speaker 5:          17:15          you get to a point in the match, which feels very early in the match where Brett climbs onto the turnbuckle, which is the corner post of the room. He gets up on top of that, catapults himself off the turnbuckle through the air towards Sean. Mike, Super dramatic. He's kind of floating in the air there for a moment

Speaker 3:          17:34          and then in front of a hip man.

Speaker 5:          17:39          What Sean does right before bread is about to come and hit him, he pulls the referee in between Brett and Sean, a human shield of sorts. Brett hits the referee, the referee

Speaker 6:          17:49          hit Sean and all three men are lying

Speaker 5:          17:52          on the map. Is that a disqualification? It might be if they could get on Paula, oh, here we are. Right? This could, this can be the moment, but no, before the referee can get up. Sean gets up, walks over to Brett and then Shawn Puts Brett in the sharp shooter, which is Brett's signature finishing move. Basically Sean pretzels up bread's legs and sits up and within seconds the bell rings,

Speaker 4:          18:34          Sean Slides out of the rain, grabs the belt, runs to the back, takes off things, work a certain way in wrestling matches, right? Like no one gets the first pin, the second match starts and no one puts someone in submission hold and they instantly submit, especially not bred heart and ages did not appear like the time the match was supposed to end. The crowd is kind of shocked.

Speaker 6:          18:55          It's strangely quiet and there's this one moment where the camera zooms in on Brett's face while he's lying, chest down on the mat looking up and there is just this bizarre, amazing look on his face. Confusion is an emotion that almost never exists in pro wrestling.

Speaker 3:          19:16          Yeah,

Speaker 6:          19:16          there's the cartoon confusion of like everything's crazy and your arms are going like wild. Your eyeballs pop out of your head, but real confusion is one of the most compelling emotions of all. That's what you see on his face in its most pure form.

Speaker 3:          19:33          [inaudible]

Speaker 6:          19:33          genuine confusion.

Speaker 3:          19:39          [inaudible]

Speaker 4:          19:39          and then anger. Brett gets up, puts his arms on the rope, looks down

Speaker 1:          19:44          seasoned and sick man and spits right in Vince's face. He then proceeds

Speaker 4:          19:50          to get out of the ring and basically destroyed everything in sight. He goes over to the announcer's table, starts ripping it apart, he destroys the monitors, throws the headphones out into the crowd. He goes pretty nuts

Speaker 1:          20:04          and in maybe the moment that truly made you go, what is happening? Brett gets back into the ring. He takes his hand in the air and draws with his finger in the air as big as he can. W C W which is where he was going to be leaving to go work w c w and keeps doing that walking across the range of signaling w c w to the crowd.

Speaker 3:          20:34          [inaudible]

Speaker 6:          20:34          after the match, Brett heads back into the locker room looking for Vince.

Speaker 5:          20:40          It is good. It tells the cameras to shut off

Speaker 6:          20:47          and then to make a long story short, he clocks Vince in the face, knocks him out. Now the WWF has a real problem on their hands. Vince has a black guy and the fourth wall has just been torn down and they need to figure out how or if they're going to build it back up. And um, the next day, this again was the head writer at the time, Vince Russo, we had a television taping right after the, you know, you, you have roar on Monday, you know, you, you do your paper view on Sunday, you have roar on Monday. So they all huddled in a room to discuss their options. And Vince says that everybody in that room dif first knee jerk reaction is, well, we're going to sweep this under the rug and not even talk about it. I mean that, that was almost just assumed because you have to understand there's this old principle in wrestling called [inaudible]

Speaker 13:         21:36          Kayfabe. And basically what this is, is this law of the wrestling God passed down since time eternal that says, you don't talk about the fact that it's fake. Everyone knows that it's scripted and that it's fake. But you damn well better not mention that ever. Why? Because everybody has a better time when everyone is under the spell. Of it. Uh, and I was like, wait a minute,

Speaker 6:          22:02          Vince is walking around with a black eye. The boys has a black guy and one of the boys punched them in the face. Russo is saying, I understand Kayfabe but we have to address this. We can't not acknowledge this and that doesn't have to be a problem. That can be an opportunity for us. I mean it like, I hate to say this, but like it doesn't get any better than this. Rousseau says this discussion got very heated. It was passion filled and in the end nobody really knew what Vince McMahon was going to do. Why the time red hearts step center stays for his match up with Shawn and eventually Vince McMahon decides I'm going to break with Kayfabe. Now keep in mind he's always been the owner of the organization, but very few people actually knew that too. Most fans of professional wrestling, he was just an announcer that night on his own TV show. He comes out not as Vince McMahon, the ringside announcer, but as Vince McMahon, the owner of the company.

Speaker 14:         23:03          Yeah, right in the chase seven days ago. With the survivor series, did you or did you not screw Brett Hart? Some would say I screwed Bret Harte. Bret Hart would definitely tell you I screwed them. I'll look at it from a different standpoint. I look at it from the standpoint of the referee did not screw Brett Hart. Sean Michael Certainly did not screw Brett Hart, nor that Vince McMahon screw bad heart. I truly believe that Brad Hart Screwed Bret Hart and you can look in the mirror and know that I'm sure in some parts of the country right now there's a collective groan that you orchestrated in the situation and the fact that uh, there are people are not going to understand what you mean by Brett heart screwed Bret Hart. So what do you mean by that? There's a time honored tradition in the wrestling business when someone is leaving, they show the right amount of respect to the WWF superstars in this case who helped make you that superstar you show the proper respect to the organization that helped you become who you are today. It's a time honored tradition and Brett Hart didn't want to honor that tradition and the less that was Brett's decision, Brett,

Speaker 5:          24:22          rude breath. And everything changed from that point on. And according to Peter, after the Montreal screw job and after this speech, the writers of the WWF started blurring the lines on a different level. Vince McMahon, the chairman of the WWE, ladies and gentlemen, he became

Speaker 3:          24:46          Mr [inaudible],

Speaker 5:          24:49          Mr McMann, the character, the number one villain in the company.

Speaker 3:          24:54          Yeah,

Speaker 4:          24:57          there were no more ridiculous, you know, stupid, unbelievable, childish, ignorant, immature, Terrick, dors. Every character we had was basically an extension of themselves.

Speaker 3:          25:11          So,

Speaker 4:          25:14          you know, stone cold, Steve Austin was Steve Austin 1000 times magnified.

Speaker 5:          25:22          Okay?

Speaker 4:          25:23          The Rock was rocky. My via 100 times magnified. And as a result, that was the beginning of the biggest boom in the history of the wrestling business

Speaker 6:          25:36          as far as business goes. This was huge for the WWF and Vince McMahon. They came roaring back in the ratings war. They destroyed Ted Turner in the WCW. They won. And if you ask Vince Russo, why this approach, this new aesthetic was so successful, he said simply the truth. That was great TV, plain and simple. The fans just want something true. Just tell the fans what happened. But Peter says two things. One, it's way more complicated than that. It's not just about the truth. You still have these writers who are scripting the show and wrestlers who are getting that script and following it so it's not like it's now a true world. I think it's something more like there are these tiny injections of truth into this world in really unexpected moments. What that does is it puts everyone on high alert all the time for those moments and when everyone is on high alert for those moments all the time, every moment has the potential to be true, has the potential to have a little bit of that injection into it. And when you are watching for those injections,

Speaker 1:          26:44          it completely changes how you are engaging with the art form, with the entertainment. And that creates an entirely new type of fan, what they call a smart fan, a smart Marcus smart as they're known people who will love the wrestling business but really love the behind the scenes of the business. No. What now? What was the smart mark? Smart Mark. Here's where you can get a little lingo. Crazy. [inaudible] the lingo part of wrestling is a huge, huge part of it. And uh, mark is someone who doesn't know that wrestling is fake or using another piece of jargon here that it is a work. Yes. A work is anything that's not real. Okay. As opposed to a shoot, which is something that's real, like the Montreal screw job. Yes. Our shoots by definition, something that's not supposed to happen in the ring. A shoot should never happen. But yeah. Then there's something called, of course, a work shoot

Speaker 3:          27:42          [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          27:44          and that's something that does happen. What does that, where you script it to seem like it's totally unscripted and it may even be real life that they're injecting into it, but it was planned, was still all discussed that this is what would happen. And so watching wrestling becomes this game of hunting for the truth according to David Shoemaker and not just any truth, but the authentic truth, the true truths, the truth, truth. Even if you know that it's fake, there's some point where the guys are really going at it in the ring that you're just like, wow, maybe it's real. Just that right there. And that's what makes wrestling so powerful. It's the never ending search for the reality, uh, within the unreal. The fact that we get so blend these things together. I mean, another example that's just fantastic is, um, in the early two thousands, there was edge, Matt hardy and a girl named Lita Lita and Matt Hardy were legitimately in love dating for years. Edge and Matt Hardy were legitimately best friends

Speaker 3:          28:44          and then you make your life miserable edge ended up with Lita took his best friend's girl. You bet your life miserable too. Something that unfortunately happens in life. Sometimes guy kills and it was turned into a storyline. Man had fought over women since the beginning of time and we got to see an epic battle over one right now. I find it incredible that you could go out into the room and pretend to beat the hell out of someone. You want to beat the hell out. [inaudible] to know that you have to go out there,

Speaker 1:          29:24          work really hard against someone you legitimately hate and also absolutely have to protect. How can we not find that? Fascinating. That's awesome. That's incredible. It's like watching Fleetwood Mac go on tour. Exactly. That's what I was going to say next. That's Andrew Moranz the way from the New Yorker and play all their songs cause all their songs. They all had these love quadrangles. They all were married and left each other and wrote songs about, I'm so pissed off at you because you left me for the guy who's standing right there. And then they'd go out on tour and Lindsey Buckingham is standing right next to CV annex playing the song that he wrote about you betrayed me. I hate you so much. It's crazy. It right after night. Super Fascinating. Yeah. I just think there's a part of the human brain that wants to be confused between those boundaries that wants to be slipping in between.

Speaker 1:          30:12          What's real, what's fake to feel that confusion. I feel like that's why Jimmy Fallon was so successful on Saturday night live, not because he was the greatest sketch comedian, but because he broke a lot and you, you can't do that in wrestling because those moments are the best. You have to save them. You have to save them. And when people acknowledge a moment and you can tell they look around at the crowd and they're acknowledging like this is, or someone says one line that everyone kind of knows. It's like, Whoa, that's kind of real. Those moments are special and you, you have to save them. Hold on one sec guys. Sorry. Hey, what's up? He's on the way. All right. I'm I'll, I'll be leaving shortly. Peace. Sorry guys. I'll show way it's, come on guys. One real quick question. What have you, of course, what happened to Peter, Brent, Brent Hart after this? It's a, did he go off to WCW and have a big career? Well, that's Sorta the interesting thing is that after the Montreal screw job, a few weeks later, Brett showed up on WCW television and it never really worked out for Brett.

Speaker 7:          31:10          In 1999, just two years into his contract with WCW during a match, he got kicked in the head and suffered a severe concussion

Speaker 1:          31:19          and it, it, it was the beginning of the end

Speaker 10:         31:23          that same year.

Speaker 14:         31:24          Well, Ladies and gentlemen, uh, something has gone terribly wrong.

Speaker 10:         31:28          Brett's brother Owen Hartman who was wrestling for the WWF, um, during one of his entrances to the match. He was entering from the ceiling and something with the stunt went terribly wrong and he fell 50 feet into the ring and, and he died. Anyway,

Speaker 14:         31:46          this is not a part of the show. This is real life. Oh one mark is being attended to right now by,

Speaker 10:         31:53          oh, I went through right away. I said I could never, I don't think I can ever go back. Brett Hart spoke with Terry Gross about a year after this incident. You think of all these sort of contrived storylines that they have in wrestling, you know, this guy's going to come in and he's going to do that. And he's gonna, he's gonna say this about you. Are they gonna I just thought I heard anything that you could possibly imagine is so pathetically meaningless when you relate to the, the real life horror. What happened with my brother, he would

Speaker 7:          32:19          retire shortly after saying that.

Speaker 15:         32:34          [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible]

Speaker 3:          33:06          [inaudible]

Speaker 15:         33:10          [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          33:10          so thank you to um, to Simon. Uh, what did we decide his wrestling name was? Simon Simon, the growling gruyere. Adler. Adler. Cause he's from Wisconsin. So you have to be like a fierce cheese cheese. And thank you. Also a very special thanks to fresh air for letting US air their Brett Hart interview and thank you also to Paul J for allowing us to play some clips from his documentary and wrestling with shadows.
