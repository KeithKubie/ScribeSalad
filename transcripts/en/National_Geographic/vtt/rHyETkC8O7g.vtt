00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:09.467
We don't go to them and say,
hey, we've got electricity.

00:00:09.467 --> 00:00:10.767
We're going to bring it to you.

00:00:10.767 --> 00:00:12.100
We're going to bring
you modern entertainment

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:14.300
that electricity provide, no.

00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:17.834
They're coming to us and saying,
we're so far off the grid,

00:00:17.834 --> 00:00:20.533
we don't have any electricity,
we're using kerosene,

00:00:20.533 --> 00:00:23.066
we have to carry the
kerosene hundreds of miles

00:00:23.066 --> 00:00:25.667
to our village on
a regular schedule.

00:00:25.667 --> 00:00:27.400
What little electricity
you have is coming

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:29.333
from some diesel generators.

00:00:29.333 --> 00:00:30.667
It's not very efficient.

00:00:30.667 --> 00:00:32.233
It's not very healthy.

00:00:32.233 --> 00:00:33.867
Matter of fact, the
fumes are damaging

00:00:33.867 --> 00:00:36.033
the insides of the monasteries
and things like that.

00:00:36.033 --> 00:00:40.533
So our bringing electricity them
is for them a dream come true.

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.133
There are some landslides
which happened last month,

00:01:09.133 --> 00:01:10.367
so the roads are not so good.

00:01:10.367 --> 00:01:12.633
Now in good condition.

00:01:12.633 --> 00:01:15.400
And secondly, if it rains,
it can be really risky

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:17.667
for us to even move ahead.

00:01:17.667 --> 00:01:19.767
Because if we go ahead and
we get stuck in some area,

00:01:19.767 --> 00:01:22.200
we can't either go
back or go forward.

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:23.867
Oh my god, it's tough.

00:01:23.867 --> 00:01:47.433
[music playing]

00:01:47.433 --> 00:01:49.200
What is the natural response
for you when you enter

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.233
a room that is not lit up?

00:01:51.233 --> 00:01:52.233
To reach for a light switch.

00:01:52.233 --> 00:01:53.567
To reach for a light switch.

00:01:53.567 --> 00:01:55.200
And that is something
that these villagers

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:56.667
have never experienced.

00:02:01.333 --> 00:02:03.734
Actually had tears of joy.

00:02:03.734 --> 00:02:07.100
Just like looking back at
the caravan of vehicles

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:12.433
that were all coming together to
do this amazing thing together.
