remember polio of course we don't have
 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:47.000
remember polio of course we don't have
it anymore but if we did if we did here

it anymore but if we did if we did here
 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:49.190
it anymore but if we did if we did here
that would be time for polio right

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200
that would be time for polio right
 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.410
that would be time for polio right
anything else I don't think I told you

mosquitoes are coming that's right
 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:59.510
mosquitoes are coming that's right
Eddie mosquito-borne viral disease will

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520
Eddie mosquito-borne viral disease will
 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.400
Eddie mosquito-borne viral disease will
become more prevalent in this summer we

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410
become more prevalent in this summer we
 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:03.709
become more prevalent in this summer we
don't have a lot in the US but there are

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719
don't have a lot in the US but there are
 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:06.410
don't have a lot in the US but there are
a number of Flavie viruses and other

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420
a number of Flavie viruses and other
 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:10.850
a number of Flavie viruses and other
vector borne viruses anybody seen the

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860
vector borne viruses anybody seen the
 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:13.550
vector borne viruses anybody seen the
press lately he's been reporting about a

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560
press lately he's been reporting about a
 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:16.130
press lately he's been reporting about a
mosquito-borne virus that was supposedly

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140
mosquito-borne virus that was supposedly
 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:18.800
mosquito-borne virus that was supposedly
sexually transmitted anybody seen this

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810
sexually transmitted anybody seen this
 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:22.810
sexually transmitted anybody seen this
no guys don't don't you look at the news

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:22.820
no guys don't don't you look at the news
 

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:26.109
no guys don't don't you look at the news
every major news online has got this

00:01:26.109 --> 00:01:26.119
every major news online has got this
 

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:29.359
every major news online has got this
virus transmitted by sexual activity

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369
virus transmitted by sexual activity
 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:32.030
virus transmitted by sexual activity
supposed to be a mosquito-borne virus no

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040
supposed to be a mosquito-borne virus no
 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:36.050
supposed to be a mosquito-borne virus no
okay well this was a kind of exotic

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060
okay well this was a kind of exotic
 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:37.760
okay well this was a kind of exotic
virus from Africa which is

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770
virus from Africa which is
 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:42.190
virus from Africa which is
mosquito-borne and this could this I

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:42.200
mosquito-borne and this could this I
 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:45.410
mosquito-borne and this could this I
think the guy was working there and he

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420
think the guy was working there and he
 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:49.010
think the guy was working there and he
came home and I think his wife was home

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020
came home and I think his wife was home
 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:51.889
came home and I think his wife was home
and then he developed symptoms and then

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899
and then he developed symptoms and then
 

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:53.480
and then he developed symptoms and then
she did and they both got infected and

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490
she did and they both got infected and
 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:54.980
she did and they both got infected and
the idea is that it was transmitted

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990
the idea is that it was transmitted
 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:58.490
the idea is that it was transmitted
sexually so there's a study a clinical

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500
sexually so there's a study a clinical
 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.950
sexually so there's a study a clinical
study of two all right and so every

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960
study of two all right and so every
 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:03.050
study of two all right and so every
newspaper I've looked at has sexually

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060
newspaper I've looked at has sexually
 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:05.330
newspaper I've looked at has sexually
transmitted virus in the headlines so

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340
transmitted virus in the headlines so
 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:07.340
transmitted virus in the headlines so
it's really amazing this is what I'm

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350
it's really amazing this is what I'm
 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:08.749
it's really amazing this is what I'm
trying to correct by teaching this

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759
trying to correct by teaching this
 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:10.369
trying to correct by teaching this
course so if any of you become

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:10.379
course so if any of you become
 

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:12.710
course so if any of you become
journalists you have to read the paper

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720
journalists you have to read the paper
 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:13.790
journalists you have to read the paper
because in this case

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800
because in this case
 

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:16.400
because in this case
you read the paper it says we cannot

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:16.410
you read the paper it says we cannot
 

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:18.620
you read the paper it says we cannot
prove that transmission was sexual but

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:18.630
prove that transmission was sexual but
 

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:20.750
prove that transmission was sexual but
the conditions suggest that it might be

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:20.760
the conditions suggest that it might be
 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:22.880
the conditions suggest that it might be
but every journalist just takes the

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:22.890
but every journalist just takes the
 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:25.010
but every journalist just takes the
headline and says sexually transmitted

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:25.020
headline and says sexually transmitted
 

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:26.960
headline and says sexually transmitted
infection so this really bothers me

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:26.970
infection so this really bothers me
 

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:29.000
infection so this really bothers me
because they don't read the papers they

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:29.010
because they don't read the papers they
 

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:31.370
because they don't read the papers they
don't have time I understand but now the

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:31.380
don't have time I understand but now the
 

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:33.380
don't have time I understand but now the
whole country is thinking that this

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:33.390
whole country is thinking that this
 

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:35.420
whole country is thinking that this
virus is sexually transmitted all right

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:35.430
virus is sexually transmitted all right
 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:39.170
virus is sexually transmitted all right
so let's screw it up all right now that

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:39.180
so let's screw it up all right now that
 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:41.000
so let's screw it up all right now that
I'm finished ranting about that let's

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:41.010
I'm finished ranting about that let's
 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:42.770
I'm finished ranting about that let's
talk about vaccines anybody here been

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:42.780
talk about vaccines anybody here been
 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:46.240
talk about vaccines anybody here been
immunized against the virus infection

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:46.250
immunized against the virus infection
 

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:48.710
immunized against the virus infection
you haven't been yes you have is anyone

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:48.720
you haven't been yes you have is anyone
 

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:51.890
you haven't been yes you have is anyone
not been immunized yeah that's more

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:51.900
not been immunized yeah that's more
 

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:54.170
not been immunized yeah that's more
likely so you're in the age group that

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:54.180
likely so you're in the age group that
 

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:57.740
likely so you're in the age group that
you are all immunized and vaccines are

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:57.750
you are all immunized and vaccines are
 

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:58.970
you are all immunized and vaccines are
what we're going to talk about today

00:02:58.970 --> 00:02:58.980
what we're going to talk about today
 

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:01.430
what we're going to talk about today
because that's vaccination is a form of

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:01.440
because that's vaccination is a form of
 

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:04.940
because that's vaccination is a form of
immunization and as you know as we've

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:04.950
immunization and as you know as we've
 

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:06.770
immunization and as you know as we've
talked about throughout this course

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:06.780
talked about throughout this course
 

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:08.780
talked about throughout this course
there are lots of viruses impinging on

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:08.790
there are lots of viruses impinging on
 

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:11.600
there are lots of viruses impinging on
this all the time and they're always one

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:11.610
this all the time and they're always one
 

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:13.670
this all the time and they're always one
step ahead of us so is it possible that

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:13.680
step ahead of us so is it possible that
 

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:16.490
step ahead of us so is it possible that
we can get ahead of them can we get the

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:16.500
we can get ahead of them can we get the
 

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:17.840
we can get ahead of them can we get the
upper hand

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:17.850
upper hand
 

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:19.520
upper hand
can we do something to supplant

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:19.530
can we do something to supplant
 

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:22.640
can we do something to supplant
supplement our natural defenses indeed

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:22.650
supplement our natural defenses indeed
 

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:25.729
supplement our natural defenses indeed
could we even eradicate a virus from the

00:03:25.729 --> 00:03:25.739
could we even eradicate a virus from the
 

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:29.000
could we even eradicate a virus from the
planet has any virus been eradicated do

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:29.010
planet has any virus been eradicated do
 

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:32.900
planet has any virus been eradicated do
you know yes it's the only one that's

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:32.910
you know yes it's the only one that's
 

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:35.090
you know yes it's the only one that's
been eradicated and we're working on

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:35.100
been eradicated and we're working on
 

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:38.060
been eradicated and we're working on
polio so today we'll talk about vaccines

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:38.070
polio so today we'll talk about vaccines
 

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:39.170
polio so today we'll talk about vaccines
and then next time we'll talk about

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:39.180
and then next time we'll talk about
 

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:41.810
and then next time we'll talk about
antivirals these are our two ways that

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:41.820
antivirals these are our two ways that
 

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:44.990
antivirals these are our two ways that
we try and intervene in the virus host

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:45.000
we try and intervene in the virus host
 

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.770
we try and intervene in the virus host
interaction and a population scale

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:47.780
interaction and a population scale
 

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:49.970
interaction and a population scale
vaccines and drugs can be really

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:49.980
vaccines and drugs can be really
 

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:52.940
vaccines and drugs can be really
effective but as you are beginning to

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:52.950
effective but as you are beginning to
 

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:55.130
effective but as you are beginning to
understand from this course the virus

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:55.140
understand from this course the virus
 

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:56.600
understand from this course the virus
host interaction is pretty complicated

00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:56.610
host interaction is pretty complicated
 

00:03:56.610 --> 00:03:59.870
host interaction is pretty complicated
and sometimes you can't intervene

00:03:59.870 --> 00:03:59.880
and sometimes you can't intervene
 

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:03.310
and sometimes you can't intervene
without affecting things in unknown ways

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:03.320
without affecting things in unknown ways
 

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:05.840
without affecting things in unknown ways
and in fact even though we have an

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:05.850
and in fact even though we have an
 

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:07.820
and in fact even though we have an
entire course on viral adji what we

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:07.830
entire course on viral adji what we
 

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:10.550
entire course on viral adji what we
don't know is humbling when we test

the vaccines have not been useful when
you have results such as these

00:06:45.910 --> 00:06:45.920

vaccinations of course engages the

00:06:48.890 --> 00:06:48.900
vaccinations of course engages the
 

00:06:48.900 --> 00:06:51.470
vaccinations of course engages the

00:06:51.470 --> 00:06:51.480
immune response that you already have to
 

00:06:51.480 --> 00:06:53.240
immune response that you already have to
prevent virus infections and it also

00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:53.250
prevent virus infections and it also
 

00:06:53.250 --> 00:06:57.410
prevent virus infections and it also
engages memory system as we will see the

00:06:57.410 --> 00:06:57.420
engages memory system as we will see the
 

00:06:57.420 --> 00:07:00.380
engages memory system as we will see the
key concept in using vaccines is that we

00:07:00.380 --> 00:07:00.390
key concept in using vaccines is that we
 

00:07:00.390 --> 00:07:02.380
key concept in using vaccines is that we
break the transmission cycle of

00:07:02.380 --> 00:07:02.390
break the transmission cycle of
 

00:07:02.390 --> 00:07:05.060
break the transmission cycle of
host-to-host spread so a virus has to go

00:07:05.060 --> 00:07:05.070
host-to-host spread so a virus has to go
 

00:07:05.070 --> 00:07:07.430
host-to-host spread so a virus has to go
from host the host to maintain itself in

00:07:07.430 --> 00:07:07.440
from host the host to maintain itself in
 

00:07:07.440 --> 00:07:10.070
from host the host to maintain itself in
a population and by immunizing with

00:07:10.070 --> 00:07:10.080
a population and by immunizing with
 

00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:12.530
a population and by immunizing with
vaccines we break this chain of

00:07:12.530 --> 00:07:12.540
vaccines we break this chain of
 

00:07:12.540 --> 00:07:16.040
vaccines we break this chain of
transmission and they do so by

00:07:16.040 --> 00:07:16.050
transmission and they do so by
 

00:07:16.050 --> 00:07:18.260
transmission and they do so by
stimulating a protective immune response

00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:18.270
stimulating a protective immune response
 

00:07:18.270 --> 00:07:21.350

then we have our first infection and
 

00:07:37.590 --> 00:07:39.830
then we have our first infection and
starting at about seven days we have the

starting at about seven days we have the
 

00:07:39.840 --> 00:07:42.440
starting at about seven days we have the
initial response can be antibodies or

00:07:42.440 --> 00:07:42.450
initial response can be antibodies or
 

00:07:42.450 --> 00:07:44.690

00:07:44.700 --> 00:07:47.090
cells which matures in about two weeks
and then declines with time so you don't

00:07:47.090 --> 00:07:47.100
and then declines with time so you don't
 

00:07:47.100 --> 00:07:49.220
and then declines with time so you don't
have the effector cells present at high

00:07:49.220 --> 00:07:49.230
have the effector cells present at high
 

00:07:49.230 --> 00:07:51.290
have the effector cells present at high

persist for a long time and during that
 

00:07:55.860 --> 00:07:57.680
persist for a long time and during that
time you have protective immunity when

00:07:57.680 --> 00:07:57.690
time you have protective immunity when
 

00:07:57.690 --> 00:07:59.150

00:08:02.540 --> 00:08:02.550
pathogen you have stimulation of
 

00:08:02.550 --> 00:08:05.990
pathogen you have stimulation of
immunological memory so the memory

00:08:05.990 --> 00:08:06.000
immunological memory so the memory
 

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:08.330
immunological memory so the memory
remains from the initial infection you

00:08:08.330 --> 00:08:08.340
remains from the initial infection you
 

00:08:08.340 --> 00:08:10.700
remains from the initial infection you
have a very rapid much more rapid than

00:08:10.700 --> 00:08:10.710
have a very rapid much more rapid than
 

00:08:10.710 --> 00:08:12.620
have a very rapid much more rapid than
the initial response as you can see and

00:08:12.620 --> 00:08:12.630
the initial response as you can see and
 

00:08:12.630 --> 00:08:14.900
the initial response as you can see and
more robust response so this is what

00:08:14.900 --> 00:08:14.910
more robust response so this is what
 

00:08:14.910 --> 00:08:16.190
more robust response so this is what
protects you this is immunological

so you have to design a vaccine so it

00:10:30.590 --> 00:10:30.600
so you have to design a vaccine so it
 

00:10:30.600 --> 00:10:32.540
so you have to design a vaccine so it
doesn't make you sick yet it protects

of course is given to Edward Jenner who
developed a vaccine against smallpox in

00:11:54.850 --> 00:11:54.860
developed a vaccine against smallpox in
 

00:11:54.860 --> 00:11:59.930
developed a vaccine against smallpox in
1917 96 and Jenner noticed that milk

get smallpox so he thought maybe cow pox

00:12:06.590 --> 00:12:06.600
get smallpox so he thought maybe cow pox
 

00:12:06.600 --> 00:12:09.020
get smallpox so he thought maybe cow pox
and smallpox are related and so he

00:12:09.020 --> 00:12:09.030
and smallpox are related and so he
 

00:12:09.030 --> 00:12:11.300
and smallpox are related and so he
actually took a cow pox lesion and

00:12:11.300 --> 00:12:11.310
actually took a cow pox lesion and
 

00:12:11.310 --> 00:12:13.220
actually took a cow pox lesion and
rubbed it into his skin of a young boy

00:12:13.220 --> 00:12:13.230
rubbed it into his skin of a young boy
 

00:12:13.230 --> 00:12:15.260
rubbed it into his skin of a young boy
and that boy was then protected against

00:12:15.260 --> 00:12:15.270
and that boy was then protected against
 

00:12:15.270 --> 00:12:19.250
and that boy was then protected against
smallpox the smallpox vaccine was then

00:12:19.250 --> 00:12:19.260
smallpox the smallpox vaccine was then
 

00:12:19.260 --> 00:12:21.080
smallpox the smallpox vaccine was then
developed and it was used for many many

number of ssp cases in the u.s. reported
 

00:15:11.850 --> 00:15:15.620
number of ssp cases in the u.s. reported
so in the peak 50 to 60 cases invariably

as well I shouldn't say all of them

00:15:20.270 --> 00:15:20.280
as well I shouldn't say all of them
 

00:15:20.280 --> 00:15:21.800
as well I shouldn't say all of them
because we still have some measles in

00:15:21.800 --> 00:15:21.810
because we still have some measles in
 

00:15:21.810 --> 00:15:23.810
because we still have some measles in
the u.s. because there are individuals

00:15:23.810 --> 00:15:23.820
the u.s. because there are individuals
 

00:15:23.820 --> 00:15:26.180
the u.s. because there are individuals
who do not immunize their children

00:15:26.180 --> 00:15:26.190
who do not immunize their children
 

00:15:26.190 --> 00:15:27.710
who do not immunize their children
because they believe vaccines are

00:15:27.710 --> 00:15:27.720
because they believe vaccines are
 

00:15:27.720 --> 00:15:30.499
because they believe vaccines are
harmful or something else and so we have

00:15:30.499 --> 00:15:30.509
harmful or something else and so we have
 

00:15:30.509 --> 00:15:32.540
harmful or something else and so we have
pockets of susceptible individuals this

00:15:32.540 --> 00:15:32.550
pockets of susceptible individuals this
 

00:15:32.550 --> 00:15:34.579
pockets of susceptible individuals this
this often happens in groups in

00:15:34.579 --> 00:15:34.589
this often happens in groups in
 

00:15:34.589 --> 00:15:36.019
this often happens in groups in
communities so you have a lot of

00:15:36.019 --> 00:15:36.029
communities so you have a lot of
 

00:15:36.029 --> 00:15:37.790
communities so you have a lot of
susceptible children and there are

00:15:37.790 --> 00:15:37.800
susceptible children and there are
 

00:15:37.800 --> 00:15:39.110
susceptible children and there are
outbreaks because there's a lot of

00:15:39.110 --> 00:15:39.120
outbreaks because there's a lot of
 

00:15:39.120 --> 00:15:41.119
outbreaks because there's a lot of
measles virus easily and it can be

00:15:41.119 --> 00:15:41.129

readily introduced into these

00:15:42.410 --> 00:15:42.420
readily introduced into these
 

00:15:42.420 --> 00:15:47.660
readily introduced into these
communities so here are two important

00:15:47.660 --> 00:15:47.670
communities so here are two important
 

00:15:47.670 --> 00:15:49.790

00:15:49.790 --> 00:15:49.800
ideas about how vaccines do and don't
 

00:15:49.800 --> 00:15:51.530
ideas about how vaccines do and don't
work first of all there's the concept of

00:15:51.530 --> 00:15:51.540
work first of all there's the concept of
 

00:15:51.540 --> 00:15:53.660
work first of all there's the concept of
herd immunity which is often

00:15:53.660 --> 00:15:53.670
herd immunity which is often
 

00:15:53.670 --> 00:15:56.780
herd immunity which is often
misinterpreted it means that you

00:15:56.780 --> 00:15:56.790
misinterpreted it means that you
 

00:15:56.790 --> 00:15:59.059
misinterpreted it means that you
immunize enough people to block virus

00:15:59.059 --> 00:15:59.069
immunize enough people to block virus
 

00:15:59.069 --> 00:16:02.119
immunize enough people to block virus
spread you don't immunize everyone you

00:16:02.119 --> 00:16:02.129
spread you don't immunize everyone you
 

00:16:02.129 --> 00:16:04.100
spread you don't immunize everyone you
immunize a fraction for whatever reason

00:16:04.100 --> 00:16:04.110

they get infected by the virus spreading
 

00:16:11.850 --> 00:16:13.639
they get infected by the virus spreading
through the population but just because

00:16:13.639 --> 00:16:13.649
through the population but just because
 

00:16:13.649 --> 00:16:16.400

you immunize enough people to stop the

00:16:16.400 --> 00:16:16.410
you immunize enough people to stop the
 

00:16:16.410 --> 00:16:17.990
you immunize enough people to stop the
spread of virus so there has to be a

00:16:17.990 --> 00:16:18.000
spread of virus so there has to be a
 

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:19.819
spread of virus so there has to be a
critical number of susceptibles and if

00:16:19.819 --> 00:16:19.829
critical number of susceptibles and if
 

00:16:19.829 --> 00:16:22.040

you get that you can stop virus spread

00:16:22.040 --> 00:16:22.050
you get that you can stop virus spread
 

00:16:22.050 --> 00:16:24.710
you get that you can stop virus spread
not everyone has to be immune to protect

get immunized and if the immunity falls
 

00:16:38.970 --> 00:16:40.670

when virus spread will stop when the
 

00:17:15.179 --> 00:17:17.779

in order to prevent spread so you don't
 

00:17:34.630 --> 00:17:37.620
in order to prevent spread so you don't
have to immunize everyone for measles

00:17:37.620 --> 00:17:37.630
have to immunize everyone for measles
 

00:17:37.630 --> 00:17:40.200
have to immunize everyone for measles
it's higher you have to have 93 to 95

00:17:40.200 --> 00:17:40.210
it's higher you have to have 93 to 95

stop virus spread now the problem is

00:17:48.750 --> 00:17:48.760
stop virus spread now the problem is
 

00:17:48.760 --> 00:17:50.580
stop virus spread now the problem is
that no vaccine is a hundred percent

00:17:50.580 --> 00:17:50.590
that no vaccine is a hundred percent
 

00:17:50.590 --> 00:17:53.400
that no vaccine is a hundred percent
effective so even if you could immunize

00:17:53.400 --> 00:17:53.410
effective so even if you could immunize
 

00:17:53.410 --> 00:17:55.380

a hundred percent of the population you

00:17:55.380 --> 00:17:55.390
a hundred percent of the population you
 

00:17:55.390 --> 00:17:57.720
a hundred percent of the population you
wouldn't get a hundred percent immunity

00:17:57.720 --> 00:17:57.730
wouldn't get a hundred percent immunity
 

00:17:57.730 --> 00:18:00.480

and the number varies but it's rarely

00:18:00.480 --> 00:18:00.490
and the number varies but it's rarely
 

00:18:00.490 --> 00:18:02.640

over 90 percent for example the flu

00:18:02.640 --> 00:18:02.650
over 90 percent for example the flu
 

00:18:02.650 --> 00:18:05.640
over 90 percent for example the flu
vaccine is well below 90 percent in its

vaccine is well below 90 percent in its
 

00:18:05.650 --> 00:18:07.980
vaccine is well below 90 percent in its
efficacy even if you if you immunize a

00:18:07.980 --> 00:18:07.990

actually be protected depending on the

00:18:12.779 --> 00:18:12.789
actually be protected depending on the
 

00:18:12.789 --> 00:18:17.640
actually be protected depending on the
year and the vaccine so for example with

00:18:17.640 --> 00:18:17.650
year and the vaccine so for example with
 

00:18:17.650 --> 00:18:19.289
year and the vaccine so for example with
the measles vaccine when you immunize

00:18:19.289 --> 00:18:19.299
the measles vaccine when you immunize
 

00:18:19.299 --> 00:18:23.520
the measles vaccine when you immunize
80% of the population only 70 / 76

00:18:23.520 --> 00:18:23.530
80% of the population only 70 / 76
 

00:18:23.530 --> 00:18:26.010
80% of the population only 70 / 76
percent are actually immune which is not

00:18:26.010 --> 00:18:26.020

bad it's a pretty good vaccine it's

00:18:27.810 --> 00:18:27.820
bad it's a pretty good vaccine it's
 

00:18:27.820 --> 00:18:30.060
bad it's a pretty good vaccine it's
better than the influenza vaccine all

your immunity kicked in right so you
 

00:19:41.020 --> 00:19:42.720

could get the flu right after getting
 

00:19:42.730 --> 00:19:43.950
could get the flu right after getting

programs and right now we have a problem

00:19:55.379 --> 00:19:55.389
programs and right now we have a problem
 

00:19:55.389 --> 00:19:57.930
programs and right now we have a problem
because the anti vaccine sentiment in

00:19:57.930 --> 00:19:57.940
because the anti vaccine sentiment in
 

00:19:57.940 --> 00:20:00.379
because the anti vaccine sentiment in
this country is quite strong and growing

00:20:00.379 --> 00:20:00.389
this country is quite strong and growing
 

00:20:00.389 --> 00:20:03.229
this country is quite strong and growing
and it's all based on misinformation and

00:20:03.229 --> 00:20:03.239
and it's all based on misinformation and
 

00:20:03.239 --> 00:20:07.259
and it's all based on misinformation and
it's really unfortunate because people

00:20:07.259 --> 00:20:07.269
it's really unfortunate because people
 

00:20:07.269 --> 00:20:08.249
it's really unfortunate because people
are not getting information from

vaccine and this is great we need more

00:21:50.339 --> 00:21:50.349
vaccine and this is great we need more
 

00:21:50.349 --> 00:21:52.529
vaccine and this is great we need more
people that were willing to do this and

00:21:52.529 --> 00:21:52.539
people that were willing to do this and
 

00:21:52.539 --> 00:21:54.599

and invested into making health care my

00:21:56.789 --> 00:21:56.799
and invested into making health care my

and invested into making health care my
philosophy is that if we

00:21:58.210 --> 00:21:58.220
philosophy is that if we
 

00:21:58.220 --> 00:22:00.279
philosophy is that if we
develop something that prolongs people's

00:22:00.279 --> 00:22:00.289
develop something that prolongs people's
 

00:22:00.289 --> 00:22:03.250

lives like a vaccine everyone should be

00:22:03.250 --> 00:22:03.260
lives like a vaccine everyone should be
 

00:22:03.260 --> 00:22:05.289
lives like a vaccine everyone should be
able to benefit from it it shouldn't be

00:22:05.289 --> 00:22:05.299
able to benefit from it it shouldn't be
 

00:22:05.299 --> 00:22:12.310
able to benefit from it it shouldn't be
restricted by the cost for example okay

00:22:12.310 --> 00:22:12.320
restricted by the cost for example okay
 

00:22:12.320 --> 00:22:14.669
restricted by the cost for example okay
let's talk about how to make a vaccine

00:22:14.669 --> 00:22:14.679
let's talk about how to make a vaccine
 

00:22:14.679 --> 00:22:18.399
let's talk about how to make a vaccine
did I just skip yes okay how to make a

00:22:18.399 --> 00:22:18.409
did I just skip yes okay how to make a
 

00:22:18.409 --> 00:22:20.919
did I just skip yes okay how to make a
vaccine so you have to make a good

00:22:20.919 --> 00:22:20.929
vaccine so you have to make a good
 

00:22:20.929 --> 00:22:24.120
vaccine so you have to make a good
immune response as we have said and

00:22:24.120 --> 00:22:24.130
immune response as we have said and
 

00:22:24.130 --> 00:22:26.860
immune response as we have said and
sometimes you have to make calculations

00:22:26.860 --> 00:22:26.870
sometimes you have to make calculations
 

00:22:26.870 --> 00:22:30.250
sometimes you have to make calculations
so for example the th1 and th2 response

00:22:30.250 --> 00:22:30.260
so for example the th1 and th2 response
 

00:22:30.260 --> 00:22:32.169
so for example the th1 and th2 response
and many infections has to be properly

00:22:32.169 --> 00:22:32.179
and many infections has to be properly
 

00:22:32.179 --> 00:22:33.610
and many infections has to be properly
balanced and we talked a little bit

00:22:33.610 --> 00:22:33.620
balanced and we talked a little bit
 

00:22:33.620 --> 00:22:35.470
balanced and we talked a little bit
about that vaccines have to mimic that

00:22:35.470 --> 00:22:35.480
about that vaccines have to mimic that
 

00:22:35.480 --> 00:22:39.520
about that vaccines have to mimic that
the gold standard is that a vaccinated

00:22:39.520 --> 00:22:39.530
the gold standard is that a vaccinated
 

00:22:39.530 --> 00:22:41.440
the gold standard is that a vaccinated
individual has to be protected against

00:22:41.440 --> 00:22:41.450
individual has to be protected against
 

00:22:41.450 --> 00:22:44.649
individual has to be protected against
the pathogen that causes disease making

00:22:44.649 --> 00:22:44.659
the pathogen that causes disease making
 

00:22:44.659 --> 00:22:47.140
the pathogen that causes disease making
antibodies is not enough you can't just

00:22:47.140 --> 00:22:47.150
antibodies is not enough you can't just
 

00:22:47.150 --> 00:22:49.480
antibodies is not enough you can't just
inject a vaccine into people and say it

00:22:49.480 --> 00:22:49.490
inject a vaccine into people and say it
 

00:22:49.490 --> 00:22:51.070
inject a vaccine into people and say it
makes antibodies that's fine you have to

00:22:51.070 --> 00:22:51.080
makes antibodies that's fine you have to
 

00:22:51.080 --> 00:22:54.220
makes antibodies that's fine you have to
show that the vaccine induces protection

00:22:54.220 --> 00:22:54.230
show that the vaccine induces protection
 

00:22:54.230 --> 00:22:57.039
show that the vaccine induces protection
so that requires a complicated clinical

00:22:57.039 --> 00:22:57.049
so that requires a complicated clinical
 

00:22:57.049 --> 00:23:02.230
so that requires a complicated clinical
trial vaccines can be active or passive

00:23:02.230 --> 00:23:02.240
trial vaccines can be active or passive
 

00:23:02.240 --> 00:23:07.140
trial vaccines can be active or passive
and active vaccine is that you put the

00:23:07.140 --> 00:23:07.150
and active vaccine is that you put the
 

00:23:07.150 --> 00:23:10.060
and active vaccine is that you put the
pathogen or material derived from it

00:23:10.060 --> 00:23:10.070
pathogen or material derived from it
 

00:23:10.070 --> 00:23:13.360
pathogen or material derived from it
into the recipient and this gives you

00:23:13.360 --> 00:23:13.370
into the recipient and this gives you
 

00:23:13.370 --> 00:23:15.520
into the recipient and this gives you
long term protection so these are most

00:23:15.520 --> 00:23:15.530
long term protection so these are most
 

00:23:15.530 --> 00:23:16.750
long term protection so these are most
of the vaccines we're going to talk

00:23:16.750 --> 00:23:16.760
of the vaccines we're going to talk
 

00:23:16.760 --> 00:23:18.610
of the vaccines we're going to talk
about today a passive vaccine you put

00:23:18.610 --> 00:23:18.620
about today a passive vaccine you put
 

00:23:18.620 --> 00:23:20.350
about today a passive vaccine you put
the products of the immune response into

00:23:20.350 --> 00:23:20.360
the products of the immune response into
 

00:23:20.360 --> 00:23:23.590
the products of the immune response into
the person you put antibodies or immune

00:23:23.590 --> 00:23:23.600
the person you put antibodies or immune
 

00:23:23.600 --> 00:23:24.970
the person you put antibodies or immune
cells that you get from another

00:23:24.970 --> 00:23:24.980
cells that you get from another
 

00:23:24.980 --> 00:23:27.220
cells that you get from another
individual this gives you short-term

00:23:27.220 --> 00:23:27.230
individual this gives you short-term
 

00:23:27.230 --> 00:23:28.779
individual this gives you short-term
protection but sometimes you don't have

00:23:28.779 --> 00:23:28.789
protection but sometimes you don't have
 

00:23:28.789 --> 00:23:30.730
protection but sometimes you don't have
any choice in the a good example is

00:23:30.730 --> 00:23:30.740
any choice in the a good example is
 

00:23:30.740 --> 00:23:32.890
any choice in the a good example is
rabies there's a product called rabies

00:23:32.890 --> 00:23:32.900
rabies there's a product called rabies
 

00:23:32.900 --> 00:23:36.460
rabies there's a product called rabies
immune globulin which is basically

00:23:36.460 --> 00:23:36.470
immune globulin which is basically
 

00:23:36.470 --> 00:23:39.760
immune globulin which is basically
antibodies against a rabies virus it

00:23:39.760 --> 00:23:39.770
antibodies against a rabies virus it
 

00:23:39.770 --> 00:23:43.779
antibodies against a rabies virus it
used to be pooled human serum from

00:23:43.779 --> 00:23:43.789
used to be pooled human serum from
 

00:23:43.789 --> 00:23:46.060
used to be pooled human serum from
people who had had rabies and it was

00:23:46.060 --> 00:23:46.070
people who had had rabies and it was
 

00:23:46.070 --> 00:23:48.310
people who had had rabies and it was
purified so as not to be pathogenic and

00:23:48.310 --> 00:23:48.320
purified so as not to be pathogenic and
 

00:23:48.320 --> 00:23:50.700
purified so as not to be pathogenic and
if someone is bitten by a rabid animal

00:23:50.700 --> 00:23:50.710
if someone is bitten by a rabid animal
 

00:23:50.710 --> 00:23:53.200
if someone is bitten by a rabid animal
you give them this initially to help

00:23:53.200 --> 00:23:53.210
you give them this initially to help
 

00:23:53.210 --> 00:23:54.970
you give them this initially to help
delay the spread of the virus and here's

00:23:54.970 --> 00:23:54.980
delay the spread of the virus and here's
 

00:23:54.980 --> 00:23:57.210
delay the spread of the virus and here's
here's a product sheet from one of these

00:23:57.210 --> 00:23:57.220
here's a product sheet from one of these
 

00:23:57.220 --> 00:24:00.899
here's a product sheet from one of these

more recent one rabies immune globulin
 

00:24:00.909 --> 00:24:03.430
more recent one rabies immune globulin
so this is these are some of the u.s.

00:24:03.430 --> 00:24:03.440
so this is these are some of the u.s.
 

00:24:03.440 --> 00:24:05.950
so this is these are some of the u.s.
brand names here it's given along with

00:24:05.950 --> 00:24:05.960
brand names here it's given along with
 

00:24:05.960 --> 00:24:08.020
brand names here it's given along with
the vaccine to prevent infection caused

00:24:08.020 --> 00:24:08.030
the vaccine to prevent infection caused
 

00:24:08.030 --> 00:24:10.480
the vaccine to prevent infection caused
by rabies virus

00:24:10.480 --> 00:24:10.490
by rabies virus
 

00:24:10.490 --> 00:24:12.460
by rabies virus
and this gives you protection until you

00:24:12.460 --> 00:24:12.470
and this gives you protection until you
 

00:24:12.470 --> 00:24:14.260
and this gives you protection until you
your antibodies can kick in so if you

00:24:14.260 --> 00:24:14.270
your antibodies can kick in so if you
 

00:24:14.270 --> 00:24:16.840
your antibodies can kick in so if you
get bitten by a dog for example and

00:24:16.840 --> 00:24:16.850
get bitten by a dog for example and
 

00:24:16.850 --> 00:24:19.450
get bitten by a dog for example and
there's suspected rabies the immune

00:24:19.450 --> 00:24:19.460
there's suspected rabies the immune
 

00:24:19.460 --> 00:24:21.400
there's suspected rabies the immune
globulin is injected at the bite site to

00:24:21.400 --> 00:24:21.410
globulin is injected at the bite site to
 

00:24:21.410 --> 00:24:22.810
globulin is injected at the bite site to
help neutralize the virus and then you

00:24:22.810 --> 00:24:22.820
help neutralize the virus and then you
 

00:24:22.820 --> 00:24:24.790
help neutralize the virus and then you
get immunized as well on top of it so

00:24:24.790 --> 00:24:24.800
get immunized as well on top of it so
 

00:24:24.800 --> 00:24:27.160
get immunized as well on top of it so
now there are monoclonal antibodies that

00:24:27.160 --> 00:24:27.170
now there are monoclonal antibodies that
 

00:24:27.170 --> 00:24:28.930
now there are monoclonal antibodies that
are produced humanized monoclonal

00:24:28.930 --> 00:24:28.940
are produced humanized monoclonal
 

00:24:28.940 --> 00:24:31.180
are produced humanized monoclonal
antibodies that are produced so we don't

00:24:31.180 --> 00:24:31.190
antibodies that are produced so we don't
 

00:24:31.190 --> 00:24:36.340
antibodies that are produced so we don't
have to use human sierra a passive

00:24:36.340 --> 00:24:36.350
have to use human sierra a passive

vaccine occurs when you are born you get

00:24:38.830 --> 00:24:38.840
vaccine occurs when you are born you get
 

00:24:38.840 --> 00:24:41.890
vaccine occurs when you are born you get
antibodies from your mother so here is a

00:24:41.890 --> 00:24:41.900
antibodies from your mother so here is a
 

00:24:41.900 --> 00:24:44.080

00:24:44.090 --> 00:24:46.960
course of development from conception
through birth and adult years this is

00:24:46.960 --> 00:24:46.970
through birth and adult years this is
 

00:24:46.970 --> 00:24:50.560
through birth and adult years this is
the fraction of adult antibody levels of

00:24:50.560 --> 00:24:50.570
the fraction of adult antibody levels of
 

00:24:50.570 --> 00:24:54.720
the fraction of adult antibody levels of
different kinds IgM IgG and IgA and

00:24:54.720 --> 00:24:54.730
different kinds IgM IgG and IgA and
 

00:24:54.730 --> 00:24:57.850
different kinds IgM IgG and IgA and
initially you receive antibodies from

00:24:57.850 --> 00:24:57.860
initially you receive antibodies from
 

00:24:57.860 --> 00:25:00.160
initially you receive antibodies from
from your mother as you can see here

00:25:00.160 --> 00:25:00.170
from your mother as you can see here
 

00:25:00.170 --> 00:25:02.650
from your mother as you can see here
this is passively transferred maternal

00:25:02.650 --> 00:25:02.660
this is passively transferred maternal
 

00:25:02.660 --> 00:25:05.350
this is passively transferred maternal
IgG and they they of course peak at

00:25:05.350 --> 00:25:05.360
IgG and they they of course peak at
 

00:25:05.360 --> 00:25:06.910
IgG and they they of course peak at
birth you can't get any more from your

00:25:06.910 --> 00:25:06.920
birth you can't get any more from your
 

00:25:06.920 --> 00:25:10.000
birth you can't get any more from your
mom after you're born but then you they

00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:10.010
mom after you're born but then you they
 

00:25:10.010 --> 00:25:13.420
mom after you're born but then you they
slowly decline in the child's blood by

00:25:13.420 --> 00:25:13.430
slowly decline in the child's blood by
 

00:25:13.430 --> 00:25:15.550
slowly decline in the child's blood by
nine months they're gone and then they

00:25:15.550 --> 00:25:15.560
nine months they're gone and then they
 

00:25:15.560 --> 00:25:18.580
nine months they're gone and then they
are replaced by your own IgM IgG and IgA

00:25:18.580 --> 00:25:18.590
are replaced by your own IgM IgG and IgA
 

00:25:18.590 --> 00:25:21.180
are replaced by your own IgM IgG and IgA
so as you become an assaulted with

00:25:21.180 --> 00:25:21.190
so as you become an assaulted with
 

00:25:21.190 --> 00:25:24.340
so as you become an assaulted with
various pathogens you develop your own

00:25:24.340 --> 00:25:24.350
various pathogens you develop your own
 

00:25:24.350 --> 00:25:26.320
various pathogens you develop your own
immune response so you can't make one in

00:25:26.320 --> 00:25:26.330
immune response so you can't make one in
 

00:25:26.330 --> 00:25:28.330
immune response so you can't make one in
utero so your mother provides you with

00:25:28.330 --> 00:25:28.340
utero so your mother provides you with
 

00:25:28.340 --> 00:25:30.310
utero so your mother provides you with
some protection and you depend on your

00:25:30.310 --> 00:25:30.320
some protection and you depend on your
 

00:25:30.320 --> 00:25:32.710
some protection and you depend on your
mother's experience for this the more

00:25:32.710 --> 00:25:32.720
mother's experience for this the more
 

00:25:32.720 --> 00:25:34.780
mother's experience for this the more
infections she has had the more

00:25:34.780 --> 00:25:34.790
infections she has had the more
 

00:25:34.790 --> 00:25:38.020
infections she has had the more
antibodies you will get so that's a

00:25:38.020 --> 00:25:38.030
antibodies you will get so that's a
 

00:25:38.030 --> 00:25:41.530
antibodies you will get so that's a
natural passive antibody one of the

00:25:41.530 --> 00:25:41.540
natural passive antibody one of the
 

00:25:41.540 --> 00:25:43.840
natural passive antibody one of the
requirements for a good vaccine has to

00:25:43.840 --> 00:25:43.850
requirements for a good vaccine has to
 

00:25:43.850 --> 00:25:45.730
requirements for a good vaccine has to
be safe of course you can't cause

00:25:45.730 --> 00:25:45.740
be safe of course you can't cause
 

00:25:45.740 --> 00:25:48.190
be safe of course you can't cause
disease or can't have side effects that

00:25:48.190 --> 00:25:48.200
disease or can't have side effects that
 

00:25:48.200 --> 00:25:49.810
disease or can't have side effects that
have don't have anything to do with the

00:25:49.810 --> 00:25:49.820
have don't have anything to do with the
 

00:25:49.820 --> 00:25:52.270
have don't have anything to do with the
disease they have to induce protective

00:25:52.270 --> 00:25:52.280
disease they have to induce protective
 

00:25:52.280 --> 00:25:54.460
disease they have to induce protective
immunity in the population and as I said

00:25:54.460 --> 00:25:54.470
immunity in the population and as I said
 

00:25:54.470 --> 00:25:56.770
immunity in the population and as I said
not everybody needs to be immunized

00:25:56.770 --> 00:25:56.780
not everybody needs to be immunized
 

00:25:56.780 --> 00:26:05.870
not everybody needs to be immunized
again yes

00:26:05.870 --> 00:26:05.880
 
 

00:26:05.880 --> 00:26:08.880
 
no no they don't receive memory cells

00:26:08.880 --> 00:26:08.890
no no they don't receive memory cells
 

00:26:08.890 --> 00:26:11.760
no no they don't receive memory cells
just antibodies from the mom and then

00:26:11.760 --> 00:26:11.770
just antibodies from the mom and then
 

00:26:11.770 --> 00:26:13.470
just antibodies from the mom and then
those declined eventually and you make

00:26:13.470 --> 00:26:13.480
those declined eventually and you make
 

00:26:13.480 --> 00:26:15.350
those declined eventually and you make
your own memory cells as you have

00:26:15.350 --> 00:26:15.360
your own memory cells as you have
 

00:26:15.360 --> 00:26:22.740
your own memory cells as you have
infection experiences as I said herd

00:26:22.740 --> 00:26:22.750
infection experiences as I said herd
 

00:26:22.750 --> 00:26:24.510
infection experiences as I said herd
immunity is important so your vaccine

00:26:24.510 --> 00:26:24.520
immunity is important so your vaccine
 

00:26:24.520 --> 00:26:26.520
immunity is important so your vaccine
has to induce herd immunity the

00:26:26.520 --> 00:26:26.530
has to induce herd immunity the
 

00:26:26.530 --> 00:26:28.320
has to induce herd immunity the
protection has to be long-lasting and

00:26:28.320 --> 00:26:28.330
protection has to be long-lasting and
 

00:26:28.330 --> 00:26:30.510
protection has to be long-lasting and
this is not assumed you can't assume

00:26:30.510 --> 00:26:30.520
this is not assumed you can't assume
 

00:26:30.520 --> 00:26:32.040
this is not assumed you can't assume
that any vaccine you made is gonna be

00:26:32.040 --> 00:26:32.050
that any vaccine you made is gonna be
 

00:26:32.050 --> 00:26:34.710
that any vaccine you made is gonna be
long-lasting some lasts forever in some

00:26:34.710 --> 00:26:34.720
long-lasting some lasts forever in some
 

00:26:34.720 --> 00:26:37.650
long-lasting some lasts forever in some
lasts a few years and the key is to

00:26:37.650 --> 00:26:37.660
lasts a few years and the key is to
 

00:26:37.660 --> 00:26:40.110
lasts a few years and the key is to
optimize the vaccine to make it as

00:26:40.110 --> 00:26:40.120
optimize the vaccine to make it as
 

00:26:40.120 --> 00:26:42.570
optimize the vaccine to make it as
long-lasting as possible it also should

00:26:42.570 --> 00:26:42.580
long-lasting as possible it also should
 

00:26:42.580 --> 00:26:45.060
long-lasting as possible it also should
be cheap w-h-o says the ideal vaccine

00:26:45.060 --> 00:26:45.070

agents that are being used and how it's

00:27:19.200 --> 00:27:19.210
agents that are being used and how it's
 

00:27:19.210 --> 00:27:20.970
agents that are being used and how it's
delivered is really important and

00:27:20.970 --> 00:27:20.980
delivered is really important and
 

00:27:20.980 --> 00:27:22.470

traditionally all our vaccines have been

00:27:22.470 --> 00:27:22.480
traditionally all our vaccines have been
 

00:27:22.480 --> 00:27:25.140
traditionally all our vaccines have been
injected we now have more that can be

00:27:25.140 --> 00:27:25.150
injected we now have more that can be
 

00:27:25.150 --> 00:27:26.910
injected we now have more that can be
taken orally but that's not appropriate

00:27:26.910 --> 00:27:26.920
taken orally but that's not appropriate
 

00:27:26.920 --> 00:27:29.640

changing too I've read recently about a

00:27:31.710 --> 00:27:31.720
changing too I've read recently about a
 

00:27:31.720 --> 00:27:34.140
changing too I've read recently about a
kind of patch that you would put on your

00:27:34.140 --> 00:27:34.150
kind of patch that you would put on your
 

00:27:34.150 --> 00:27:37.250
kind of patch that you would put on your
skin it's impregnated with vaccine and

00:27:37.250 --> 00:27:37.260
skin it's impregnated with vaccine and
 

00:27:37.260 --> 00:27:41.880
skin it's impregnated with vaccine and
the patch has tiny tiny knot needles but

00:27:41.880 --> 00:27:41.890
the patch has tiny tiny knot needles but
 

00:27:41.890 --> 00:27:44.400
the patch has tiny tiny knot needles but
tiny protuberances in it that pushed the

00:27:44.400 --> 00:27:44.410
tiny protuberances in it that pushed the
 

00:27:44.410 --> 00:27:45.930
tiny protuberances in it that pushed the
vaccine into your skin you just wear it

00:27:45.930 --> 00:27:45.940
vaccine into your skin you just wear it
 

00:27:45.940 --> 00:27:47.610
vaccine into your skin you just wear it
for a few days and you get immunized you

00:27:47.610 --> 00:27:47.620
for a few days and you get immunized you
 

00:27:47.620 --> 00:27:49.560
for a few days and you get immunized you
don't need a physician to do that you

00:27:49.560 --> 00:27:49.570
don't need a physician to do that you
 

00:27:49.570 --> 00:27:51.210
don't need a physician to do that you
can just put it on your skin yourself so

00:27:51.210 --> 00:27:51.220
can just put it on your skin yourself so
 

00:27:51.220 --> 00:27:53.880
can just put it on your skin yourself so
these are the vaccines in the future so

00:27:53.880 --> 00:27:53.890
these are the vaccines in the future so
 

00:27:53.890 --> 00:27:55.650
these are the vaccines in the future so
let's talk about some of the ways we

00:27:55.650 --> 00:27:55.660
let's talk about some of the ways we
 

00:27:55.660 --> 00:27:58.530
let's talk about some of the ways we
make vaccines today they're all shown

00:27:58.530 --> 00:27:58.540
make vaccines today they're all shown
 

00:27:58.540 --> 00:28:00.620
make vaccines today they're all shown
here starting with a parental virus

00:28:00.620 --> 00:28:00.630
here starting with a parental virus
 

00:28:00.630 --> 00:28:03.810
here starting with a parental virus
we'll talk about a couple of these the

00:28:03.810 --> 00:28:03.820
we'll talk about a couple of these the
 

00:28:03.820 --> 00:28:06.600
we'll talk about a couple of these the
the we can attenuate its virulence to

00:28:06.600 --> 00:28:06.610
the we can attenuate its virulence to
 

00:28:06.610 --> 00:28:08.580
the we can attenuate its virulence to
make eight what we call a live natural

00:28:08.580 --> 00:28:08.590
make eight what we call a live natural
 

00:28:08.590 --> 00:28:11.970
make eight what we call a live natural
virus vaccine now we we use the term

00:28:11.970 --> 00:28:11.980
virus vaccine now we we use the term
 

00:28:11.980 --> 00:28:14.360
virus vaccine now we we use the term
live vaccines even though

00:28:14.360 --> 00:28:14.370
live vaccines even though
 

00:28:14.370 --> 00:28:16.159
live vaccines even though
we know that viruses are not living

00:28:16.159 --> 00:28:16.169
we know that viruses are not living
 

00:28:16.169 --> 00:28:18.260
we know that viruses are not living
because it's been ensconced in the

00:28:18.260 --> 00:28:18.270
because it's been ensconced in the
 

00:28:18.270 --> 00:28:19.820
because it's been ensconced in the
literature and rather than changing

00:28:19.820 --> 00:28:19.830
literature and rather than changing
 

00:28:19.830 --> 00:28:20.750

I got live on here but what I mean is

00:28:22.880 --> 00:28:22.890
I got live on here but what I mean is
 

00:28:22.890 --> 00:28:25.310
I got live on here but what I mean is
infectious not live so we have

00:28:25.310 --> 00:28:25.320
infectious not live so we have
 

00:28:25.320 --> 00:28:27.350

00:28:32.299 --> 00:28:32.309
subunit vaccines where we take the
 

00:28:32.309 --> 00:28:33.799
subunit vaccines where we take the
original virus and break it up and then

00:28:33.799 --> 00:28:33.809
original virus and break it up and then
 

00:28:33.809 --> 00:28:36.380
original virus and break it up and then
we have a whole generation based on

00:28:36.380 --> 00:28:36.390
we have a whole generation based on
 

00:28:36.390 --> 00:28:39.350
we have a whole generation based on

vaccines where we inject DNA into
 

00:28:54.149 --> 00:28:56.330
vaccines where we inject DNA into
individuals and this is also being

00:28:56.330 --> 00:28:56.340
individuals and this is also being
 

00:28:56.340 --> 00:28:59.620
individuals and this is also being
tested in many ways and then we can have

00:28:59.620 --> 00:28:59.630
tested in many ways and then we can have
 

00:28:59.630 --> 00:29:02.389
tested in many ways and then we can have
vaccines where you express individual

00:29:02.389 --> 00:29:02.399
vaccines where you express individual
 

00:29:02.399 --> 00:29:04.549
vaccines where you express individual
viral proteins and sometimes they

00:29:04.549 --> 00:29:04.559
viral proteins and sometimes they
 

00:29:04.559 --> 00:29:06.950
viral proteins and sometimes they
assembled to form virus particles and

00:29:06.950 --> 00:29:06.960
assembled to form virus particles and
 

00:29:06.960 --> 00:29:08.600

00:29:08.610 --> 00:29:10.340
these are cold virus like particle
vaccines we've talked about some of

00:29:10.340 --> 00:29:10.350
vaccines we've talked about some of
 

00:29:10.350 --> 00:29:12.620
vaccines we've talked about some of
these before or you can just simply take

00:29:12.620 --> 00:29:12.630
these before or you can just simply take
 

00:29:12.630 --> 00:29:14.419
these before or you can just simply take
individual proteins and make subunit

00:29:14.419 --> 00:29:14.429
individual proteins and make subunit
 

00:29:14.429 --> 00:29:16.970
individual proteins and make subunit
vaccines so these are the current types

00:29:16.970 --> 00:29:16.980
vaccines so these are the current types
 

00:29:16.980 --> 00:29:18.710
vaccines so these are the current types
of approaches that are being used but

00:29:18.710 --> 00:29:18.720
of approaches that are being used but
 

00:29:18.720 --> 00:29:20.450
of approaches that are being used but
many more are being developed and will

00:29:20.450 --> 00:29:20.460
many more are being developed and will
 

00:29:20.460 --> 00:29:23.810
many more are being developed and will
be present in the future so this is a

00:29:23.810 --> 00:29:23.820
be present in the future so this is a
 

00:29:23.820 --> 00:29:25.970

have adenovirus vaccines which are just
 

00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:41.360
have adenovirus vaccines which are just
used for the military because they're

so there you go that's the the panoply

00:30:35.779 --> 00:30:35.789
so there you go that's the the panoply
 

00:30:35.789 --> 00:30:37.310
so there you go that's the the panoply
and these are just the kinds of vaccines

00:30:37.310 --> 00:30:37.320
and these are just the kinds of vaccines
 

00:30:37.320 --> 00:30:40.460
and these are just the kinds of vaccines
and when they are given the vaccination

00:30:40.460 --> 00:30:40.470
and when they are given the vaccination
 

00:30:40.470 --> 00:30:43.039
and when they are given the vaccination
schedule so you know some of the anti

00:30:43.039 --> 00:30:43.049
schedule so you know some of the anti
 

00:30:43.049 --> 00:30:46.190

vaccine people say Oh kids get dozens

00:30:46.190 --> 00:30:46.200
vaccine people say Oh kids get dozens
 

00:30:46.200 --> 00:30:48.680
vaccine people say Oh kids get dozens
and dozens of vaccines there's too many

00:30:48.680 --> 00:30:48.690
and dozens of vaccines there's too many
 

00:30:48.690 --> 00:30:51.320
and dozens of vaccines there's too many
antigens it's not healthy well there's

not dozens of dozens of vaccines you

00:30:53.119 --> 00:30:53.129
not dozens of dozens of vaccines you
 

00:30:53.129 --> 00:30:54.409
not dozens of dozens of vaccines you
know these are not all childhood

00:30:54.409 --> 00:30:54.419
know these are not all childhood
 

00:30:54.419 --> 00:30:56.509
know these are not all childhood
vaccines so it's again more

00:30:56.509 --> 00:30:56.519
vaccines so it's again more
 

00:30:56.519 --> 00:30:58.220
vaccines so it's again more

dozens yeah that sounds about right I'm

00:31:02.539 --> 00:31:02.549
dozens yeah that sounds about right I'm

dozens yeah that sounds about right I'm
not gonna have my kid immunized so let's

00:31:06.350 --> 00:31:06.360
not gonna have my kid immunized so let's
 

00:31:06.360 --> 00:31:08.480
not gonna have my kid immunized so let's
talk about inactivated vaccines first

00:31:08.480 --> 00:31:08.490
talk about inactivated vaccines first
 

00:31:08.490 --> 00:31:10.430
talk about inactivated vaccines first
these are simply viruses that you

00:31:10.430 --> 00:31:10.440
these are simply viruses that you
 

00:31:10.440 --> 00:31:11.869
these are simply viruses that you
propagate normally and then you

00:31:11.869 --> 00:31:11.879
propagate normally and then you
 

00:31:11.879 --> 00:31:13.580
propagate normally and then you
inactivate their infectivity in a

00:31:13.580 --> 00:31:13.590
inactivate their infectivity in a
 

00:31:13.590 --> 00:31:15.970
inactivate their infectivity in a
chemical way you can use formalin

00:31:15.970 --> 00:31:15.980
chemical way you can use formalin
 

00:31:15.980 --> 00:31:18.440

but the antigenicity is still there they

00:31:22.159 --> 00:31:22.169
but the antigenicity is still there they
 

00:31:22.169 --> 00:31:25.009
but the antigenicity is still there they
will if injected make antibodies that

00:31:25.009 --> 00:31:25.019
will if injected make antibodies that
 

00:31:25.019 --> 00:31:26.749
will if injected make antibodies that
protect you and that give you a memory

00:31:26.749 --> 00:31:26.759
protect you and that give you a memory
 

00:31:26.759 --> 00:31:29.960
protect you and that give you a memory

00:31:29.960 --> 00:31:29.970
response and the first one we'll talk
 

00:31:29.970 --> 00:31:32.509
response and the first one we'll talk
about is a polio inactivated vaccine

00:31:32.509 --> 00:31:32.519
about is a polio inactivated vaccine
 

00:31:32.519 --> 00:31:34.480
about is a polio inactivated vaccine
polio of course is the virus that causes

00:31:34.480 --> 00:31:34.490
polio of course is the virus that causes
 

00:31:34.490 --> 00:31:37.940
polio of course is the virus that causes
polio myelitis the word polio myelitis

00:31:37.940 --> 00:31:37.950
polio myelitis the word polio myelitis
 

00:31:37.950 --> 00:31:41.779
polio myelitis the word polio myelitis
comes from the greek for polio and itis

1959 textbook of medicine it was called
 

00:31:48.240 --> 00:31:50.619
1959 textbook of medicine it was called
a common acute viral disease

00:31:50.619 --> 00:31:50.629
a common acute viral disease
 

00:31:50.629 --> 00:31:53.119
a common acute viral disease
characterized by brief febrile illness

00:31:53.119 --> 00:31:53.129
characterized by brief febrile illness
 

00:31:53.129 --> 00:31:54.560
characterized by brief febrile illness
sore throat headache and vomiting

00:31:54.560 --> 00:31:54.570
sore throat headache and vomiting
 

00:31:54.570 --> 00:31:56.539
sore throat headache and vomiting
stiffness of neck and back and many of

00:31:56.539 --> 00:31:56.549
stiffness of neck and back and many of
 

00:31:56.549 --> 00:31:58.639
stiffness of neck and back and many of
those you can recognize as nonspecific

00:31:58.639 --> 00:31:58.649
those you can recognize as nonspecific
 

00:31:58.649 --> 00:32:01.659
those you can recognize as nonspecific
symptoms caused by cytokine production

00:32:01.659 --> 00:32:01.669
symptoms caused by cytokine production
 

00:32:01.669 --> 00:32:04.639
symptoms caused by cytokine production
in many cases a lower neuron paralysis

00:32:04.639 --> 00:32:04.649
in many cases a lower neuron paralysis
 

00:32:04.649 --> 00:32:07.129
in many cases a lower neuron paralysis
develops in the early days of illness so

00:32:07.129 --> 00:32:07.139
develops in the early days of illness so
 

00:32:07.139 --> 00:32:08.480
develops in the early days of illness so
of course today it's no longer common

00:32:08.480 --> 00:32:08.490
of course today it's no longer common
 

00:32:08.490 --> 00:32:10.190
of course today it's no longer common
it's not in the medical textbooks

00:32:10.190 --> 00:32:10.200
it's not in the medical textbooks
 

00:32:10.200 --> 00:32:14.539
it's not in the medical textbooks
anymore this is what polio used to do in

00:32:14.539 --> 00:32:14.549
anymore this is what polio used to do in
 

00:32:14.549 --> 00:32:16.340
anymore this is what polio used to do in
the US he used to put many individuals

00:32:16.340 --> 00:32:16.350
the US he used to put many individuals
 

00:32:16.350 --> 00:32:19.850
the US he used to put many individuals
in iron lungs because often the virus

00:32:19.850 --> 00:32:19.860
in iron lungs because often the virus
 

00:32:19.860 --> 00:32:22.639
in iron lungs because often the virus
would paralyze the breathing muscles and

00:32:22.639 --> 00:32:22.649
would paralyze the breathing muscles and
 

00:32:22.649 --> 00:32:25.519
would paralyze the breathing muscles and
so the only way was to put an individual

00:32:25.519 --> 00:32:25.529
so the only way was to put an individual
 

00:32:25.529 --> 00:32:27.019
so the only way was to put an individual
in a machine that would breathe for them

00:32:27.019 --> 00:32:27.029
in a machine that would breathe for them
 

00:32:27.029 --> 00:32:29.840
in a machine that would breathe for them
many of these individuals eventually got

00:32:29.840 --> 00:32:29.850
many of these individuals eventually got
 

00:32:29.850 --> 00:32:31.460
many of these individuals eventually got
out after therapy and they were able to

00:32:31.460 --> 00:32:31.470
out after therapy and they were able to
 

00:32:31.470 --> 00:32:34.730
out after therapy and they were able to
breathe again but US hospitals were

00:32:34.730 --> 00:32:34.740
breathe again but US hospitals were
 

00:32:34.740 --> 00:32:36.409
breathe again but US hospitals were
often full of these and now there aren't

00:32:36.409 --> 00:32:36.419
often full of these and now there aren't
 

00:32:36.419 --> 00:32:38.509
often full of these and now there aren't
any left of course and one of our

00:32:38.509 --> 00:32:38.519
any left of course and one of our
 

00:32:38.519 --> 00:32:40.639
any left of course and one of our
presidents FDR of course had polio as

00:32:40.639 --> 00:32:40.649
presidents FDR of course had polio as
 

00:32:40.649 --> 00:32:41.820
presidents FDR of course had polio as
well

00:32:41.820 --> 00:32:41.830
well
 

00:32:41.830 --> 00:32:44.640
well
because of that he initiated fundraising

00:32:44.640 --> 00:32:44.650
because of that he initiated fundraising
 

00:32:44.650 --> 00:32:46.440
because of that he initiated fundraising
that eventually led to the development

00:32:46.440 --> 00:32:46.450
that eventually led to the development
 

00:32:46.450 --> 00:32:48.240
that eventually led to the development
of both polio vaccines the March of

00:32:48.240 --> 00:32:48.250
of both polio vaccines the March of
 

00:32:48.250 --> 00:32:48.980
of both polio vaccines the March of
Dimes

00:32:48.980 --> 00:32:48.990
Dimes
 

00:32:48.990 --> 00:32:51.780
Dimes
so the inactivated vaccine is polio

00:32:51.780 --> 00:32:51.790
so the inactivated vaccine is polio
 

00:32:51.790 --> 00:32:53.880
so the inactivated vaccine is polio
virus that is treated with formalin and

00:32:53.880 --> 00:32:53.890
virus that is treated with formalin and
 

00:32:53.890 --> 00:32:56.400
virus that is treated with formalin and
that destroys the infectivity of the

00:32:56.400 --> 00:32:56.410
that destroys the infectivity of the
 

00:32:56.410 --> 00:33:00.350
that destroys the infectivity of the
virus this vaccine was first tested in

00:33:00.350 --> 00:33:00.360
virus this vaccine was first tested in
 

00:33:00.360 --> 00:33:03.720
virus this vaccine was first tested in
1954 it was developed by Jonas Salk and

00:33:03.720 --> 00:33:03.730
1954 it was developed by Jonas Salk and
 

00:33:03.730 --> 00:33:06.690
1954 it was developed by Jonas Salk and
this I find an amazing clinical trial

00:33:06.690 --> 00:33:06.700
this I find an amazing clinical trial
 

00:33:06.700 --> 00:33:08.730
this I find an amazing clinical trial
was tested in 1 million eight hundred

00:33:08.730 --> 00:33:08.740
was tested in 1 million eight hundred
 

00:33:08.740 --> 00:33:11.970
was tested in 1 million eight hundred
thousand children half got the vaccine

00:33:11.970 --> 00:33:11.980
thousand children half got the vaccine
 

00:33:11.980 --> 00:33:15.900
thousand children half got the vaccine
and half got the placebo and it gave 50%

00:33:15.900 --> 00:33:15.910
and half got the placebo and it gave 50%
 

00:33:15.910 --> 00:33:18.000
and half got the placebo and it gave 50%
protection which at the time was great

00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:18.010
protection which at the time was great
 

00:33:18.010 --> 00:33:19.950
protection which at the time was great
because everyone was scared to death of

00:33:19.950 --> 00:33:19.960
because everyone was scared to death of
 

00:33:19.960 --> 00:33:22.919
because everyone was scared to death of
polio and then it was licensed right

00:33:22.919 --> 00:33:22.929
polio and then it was licensed right
 

00:33:22.929 --> 00:33:24.299
polio and then it was licensed right
away and and began to be used

00:33:24.299 --> 00:33:24.309
away and and began to be used
 

00:33:24.309 --> 00:33:26.880
away and and began to be used
unfortunately what happened next was an

unfortunately what happened next was an
 

00:33:26.890 --> 00:33:29.190

interesting commentary on on

00:33:29.190 --> 00:33:29.200
interesting commentary on on
 

00:33:29.200 --> 00:33:32.160
interesting commentary on on
immunization well first of all let's

gives you an idea of how serious polio

00:33:52.470 --> 00:33:52.480
gives you an idea of how serious polio
 

00:33:52.480 --> 00:33:55.549

was in the u.s. at this time

00:33:55.549 --> 00:33:55.559
was in the u.s. at this time
 

00:33:55.559 --> 00:33:59.220
was in the u.s. at this time
unfortunately after releasing the the

00:33:59.220 --> 00:33:59.230
unfortunately after releasing the the
 

00:33:59.230 --> 00:34:01.200
unfortunately after releasing the the
vaccine within ten days a lot of the

00:34:01.200 --> 00:34:01.210
vaccine within ten days a lot of the

recipients developed polio eventually

00:34:03.840 --> 00:34:03.850
recipients developed polio eventually
 

00:34:03.850 --> 00:34:07.020
recipients developed polio eventually
there were 216 vaccine associated cases

00:34:07.020 --> 00:34:07.030
there were 216 vaccine associated cases
 

00:34:07.030 --> 00:34:10.859
there were 216 vaccine associated cases
in 94 children and a hundred and

00:34:10.859 --> 00:34:10.869
in 94 children and a hundred and
 

00:34:10.869 --> 00:34:12.899
in 94 children and a hundred and
sixty-six contacts and there were a

00:34:12.899 --> 00:34:12.909
sixty-six contacts and there were a
 

00:34:12.909 --> 00:34:14.460
sixty-six contacts and there were a
number of deaths as well so you can

00:34:14.460 --> 00:34:14.470
number of deaths as well so you can
 

00:34:14.470 --> 00:34:16.409
number of deaths as well so you can
imagine your parents bring you to be

00:34:16.409 --> 00:34:16.419
imagine your parents bring you to be
 

00:34:16.419 --> 00:34:18.060
imagine your parents bring you to be
immunized because they're so scared of

00:34:18.060 --> 00:34:18.070
immunized because they're so scared of
 

00:34:18.070 --> 00:34:20.450
immunized because they're so scared of
polio and then you get polio and you die

00:34:20.450 --> 00:34:20.460
polio and then you get polio and you die
 

00:34:20.460 --> 00:34:23.190
polio and then you get polio and you die
the reason was one of the laboratories

00:34:23.190 --> 00:34:23.200
the reason was one of the laboratories
 

00:34:23.200 --> 00:34:26.700
the reason was one of the laboratories
that made the vaccine Qatar labs didn't

00:34:26.700 --> 00:34:26.710
that made the vaccine Qatar labs didn't
 

00:34:26.710 --> 00:34:28.470
that made the vaccine Qatar labs didn't
do it the inactivation properly and

00:34:28.470 --> 00:34:28.480
do it the inactivation properly and
 

00:34:28.480 --> 00:34:30.300
do it the inactivation properly and
there was live virus or infectious virus

00:34:30.300 --> 00:34:30.310
there was live virus or infectious virus
 

00:34:30.310 --> 00:34:32.790
there was live virus or infectious virus
in the preparations and so Qatar

00:34:32.790 --> 00:34:32.800
in the preparations and so Qatar
 

00:34:32.800 --> 00:34:34.940
in the preparations and so Qatar
labyrinth this was actually the first

labyrinth this was actually the first
vaccine related lawsuits that preceded

vaccine related lawsuits that preceded
 

00:34:38.350 --> 00:34:42.330
vaccine related lawsuits that preceded
they were very publicized and Paul Offit

vaccine sentiment in the US the public
 

00:34:50.139 --> 00:34:53.970
vaccine sentiment in the US the public
had this huge trust in polio vaccine and

00:34:53.970 --> 00:34:53.980
had this huge trust in polio vaccine and
 

00:34:53.980 --> 00:34:55.540
had this huge trust in polio vaccine and
the first polio of

00:34:55.540 --> 00:34:55.550
the first polio of
 

00:34:55.550 --> 00:34:59.500
the first polio of
released cost polio so there were lots

00:34:59.500 --> 00:34:59.510
released cost polio so there were lots
 

00:34:59.510 --> 00:35:01.480
released cost polio so there were lots
of lawsuits over this and we're still

00:35:01.480 --> 00:35:01.490
of lawsuits over this and we're still
 

00:35:01.490 --> 00:35:04.450
of lawsuits over this and we're still
probably paying for it till this day and

00:35:36.460 --> 00:35:36.470
tough problem right it was a little bit
 

00:35:36.470 --> 00:35:39.040
tough problem right it was a little bit
of slyness on the part of the public

00:35:39.040 --> 00:35:39.050
of slyness on the part of the public
 

00:35:39.050 --> 00:35:40.810
of slyness on the part of the public
health authorities it was never admitted

00:35:40.810 --> 00:35:40.820
health authorities it was never admitted
 

00:35:40.820 --> 00:35:44.230
health authorities it was never admitted
that there was a problem publicly so

00:35:44.230 --> 00:35:44.240
that there was a problem publicly so
 

00:35:44.240 --> 00:35:46.330
that there was a problem publicly so
they did a lot of covering up and hiding

00:35:46.330 --> 00:35:46.340
they did a lot of covering up and hiding
 

00:35:46.340 --> 00:35:48.670
they did a lot of covering up and hiding
it's all in this book and there was a

00:35:48.670 --> 00:35:48.680
it's all in this book and there was a
 

00:35:48.680 --> 00:35:50.920
it's all in this book and there was a
period of a few months where the

00:35:50.920 --> 00:35:50.930
period of a few months where the
 

00:35:50.930 --> 00:35:52.990
period of a few months where the
immunization rates were very low but

00:35:52.990 --> 00:35:53.000
immunization rates were very low but
 

00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:58.660
immunization rates were very low but
then they resumed again yeah yes yes it

00:35:58.660 --> 00:35:58.670
then they resumed again yeah yes yes it
 

00:35:58.670 --> 00:36:00.310
then they resumed again yeah yes yes it
talks about what they did wrong it talks

00:36:00.310 --> 00:36:00.320
talks about what they did wrong it talks
 

00:36:00.320 --> 00:36:01.600
talks about what they did wrong it talks
about the lawsuits and all the

00:36:01.600 --> 00:36:01.610
about the lawsuits and all the
 

00:36:01.610 --> 00:36:03.280
about the lawsuits and all the
precedents that were set by this is

00:36:03.280 --> 00:36:03.290
precedents that were set by this is
 

00:36:03.290 --> 00:36:06.150
precedents that were set by this is
really good and Paul Offit is a

00:36:06.150 --> 00:36:06.160
really good and Paul Offit is a
 

00:36:06.160 --> 00:36:08.440
really good and Paul Offit is a
pediatrician but he also has developed

00:36:08.440 --> 00:36:08.450
pediatrician but he also has developed
 

00:36:08.450 --> 00:36:09.490
pediatrician but he also has developed
he developed one of the rotavirus

00:36:09.490 --> 00:36:09.500
he developed one of the rotavirus
 

00:36:09.500 --> 00:36:11.440
he developed one of the rotavirus
vaccines that we've talked about also

00:36:11.440 --> 00:36:11.450
vaccines that we've talked about also
 

00:36:11.450 --> 00:36:13.530
vaccines that we've talked about also
he's a very strong vaccine proponent

00:36:13.530 --> 00:36:13.540
he's a very strong vaccine proponent
 

00:36:13.540 --> 00:36:22.200
he's a very strong vaccine proponent
he's very good at explaining this yes

00:36:22.200 --> 00:36:22.210
 
 

00:36:22.210 --> 00:36:24.370
 
well that's a very good question so

00:36:24.370 --> 00:36:24.380
well that's a very good question so
 

00:36:24.380 --> 00:36:27.280
well that's a very good question so
initially you do epidemiology and you

00:36:27.280 --> 00:36:27.290
initially you do epidemiology and you
 

00:36:27.290 --> 00:36:29.740
initially you do epidemiology and you
say the kids that got paralyzed were

00:36:29.740 --> 00:36:29.750
say the kids that got paralyzed were
 

00:36:29.750 --> 00:36:32.320
say the kids that got paralyzed were
they immunized and right away you could

00:36:32.320 --> 00:36:32.330
they immunized and right away you could
 

00:36:32.330 --> 00:36:33.970
they immunized and right away you could
look at the immunization records and

00:36:33.970 --> 00:36:33.980
look at the immunization records and
 

00:36:33.980 --> 00:36:36.099
look at the immunization records and
tell that then you say what batch of

00:36:36.099 --> 00:36:36.109
tell that then you say what batch of
 

00:36:36.109 --> 00:36:38.380
tell that then you say what batch of
vaccine did they get so the vaccine was

00:36:38.380 --> 00:36:38.390
vaccine did they get so the vaccine was
 

00:36:38.390 --> 00:36:39.820
vaccine did they get so the vaccine was
made by six or seven different

00:36:39.820 --> 00:36:39.830
made by six or seven different
 

00:36:39.830 --> 00:36:42.040
made by six or seven different
manufacturers so they could trace it

00:36:42.040 --> 00:36:42.050
manufacturers so they could trace it
 

00:36:42.050 --> 00:36:44.290
manufacturers so they could trace it
back to one or two manufacturers and

00:36:44.290 --> 00:36:44.300
back to one or two manufacturers and
 

00:36:44.300 --> 00:36:45.670
back to one or two manufacturers and
then they looked in those Lots and they

00:36:45.670 --> 00:36:45.680
then they looked in those Lots and they
 

00:36:45.680 --> 00:36:49.480
then they looked in those Lots and they
found infectious virus so that that's

00:36:49.480 --> 00:36:49.490
found infectious virus so that that's
 

00:36:49.490 --> 00:36:51.040
found infectious virus so that that's
basically the chain of events that

00:36:51.040 --> 00:36:51.050
basically the chain of events that
 

00:36:51.050 --> 00:36:55.839
basically the chain of events that
occurred so these this vaccine the

00:36:55.839 --> 00:36:55.849
occurred so these this vaccine the
 

00:36:55.849 --> 00:36:58.089
occurred so these this vaccine the
inactivated vaccine works it's injected

00:36:58.089 --> 00:36:58.099
inactivated vaccine works it's injected
 

00:36:58.099 --> 00:37:00.970
inactivated vaccine works it's injected
this is an intramuscular injection and

00:37:00.970 --> 00:37:00.980
this is an intramuscular injection and
 

00:37:00.980 --> 00:37:02.920
this is an intramuscular injection and
you get antibodies developing in your

00:37:02.920 --> 00:37:02.930
you get antibodies developing in your
 

00:37:02.930 --> 00:37:04.780
you get antibodies developing in your
blood and so then if you are challenged

00:37:04.780 --> 00:37:04.790
blood and so then if you are challenged
 

00:37:04.790 --> 00:37:07.359
blood and so then if you are challenged
with polio which it comes in your mouth

00:37:07.359 --> 00:37:07.369
with polio which it comes in your mouth
 

00:37:07.369 --> 00:37:10.089
with polio which it comes in your mouth
and goes to your intestinal tract the

00:37:10.089 --> 00:37:10.099
and goes to your intestinal tract the
 

00:37:10.099 --> 00:37:12.400
and goes to your intestinal tract the
virus replicates in the mucosal surfaces

00:37:12.400 --> 00:37:12.410
virus replicates in the mucosal surfaces
 

00:37:12.410 --> 00:37:14.470
virus replicates in the mucosal surfaces
it gets into the blood and then at that

00:37:14.470 --> 00:37:14.480
it gets into the blood and then at that
 

00:37:14.480 --> 00:37:16.390
it gets into the blood and then at that
point it will encounter the antibodies

00:37:16.390 --> 00:37:16.400
point it will encounter the antibodies
 

00:37:16.400 --> 00:37:18.880
point it will encounter the antibodies
that have been induced by immunization

00:37:18.880 --> 00:37:18.890
that have been induced by immunization
 

00:37:18.890 --> 00:37:21.310
that have been induced by immunization
and it will be neutralized so this

00:37:21.310 --> 00:37:21.320
and it will be neutralized so this
 

00:37:21.320 --> 00:37:22.720
and it will be neutralized so this
vaccine prevents the virus from

00:37:22.720 --> 00:37:22.730
vaccine prevents the virus from
 

00:37:22.730 --> 00:37:24.010
vaccine prevents the virus from
spreading any further although it

00:37:24.010 --> 00:37:24.020
spreading any further although it
 

00:37:24.020 --> 00:37:25.630
spreading any further although it
doesn't prevent it from replicating in

00:37:25.630 --> 00:37:25.640
doesn't prevent it from replicating in
 

00:37:25.640 --> 00:37:27.790
doesn't prevent it from replicating in
your intestine so if you're immunized

00:37:27.790 --> 00:37:27.800
your intestine so if you're immunized
 

00:37:27.800 --> 00:37:30.040
your intestine so if you're immunized
with IPV you could still replicate polio

00:37:30.040 --> 00:37:30.050
with IPV you could still replicate polio
 

00:37:30.050 --> 00:37:33.490
with IPV you could still replicate polio
and shed it and spread it okay so that

00:37:33.490 --> 00:37:33.500
and shed it and spread it okay so that
 

00:37:33.500 --> 00:37:36.070
and shed it and spread it okay so that
that is the sorry the inactivated

00:37:36.070 --> 00:37:36.080
that is the sorry the inactivated
 

00:37:36.080 --> 00:37:39.960
that is the sorry the inactivated
vaccine and again introduced 1955 and

00:37:39.960 --> 00:37:39.970
vaccine and again introduced 1955 and
 

00:37:39.970 --> 00:37:42.520
vaccine and again introduced 1955 and
brought polio down significantly in the

00:37:42.520 --> 00:37:42.530
brought polio down significantly in the
 

00:37:42.530 --> 00:37:45.280
brought polio down significantly in the
US the other inactivated vaccine I want

00:37:45.280 --> 00:37:45.290
US the other inactivated vaccine I want
 

00:37:45.290 --> 00:37:46.920
US the other inactivated vaccine I want
to talk about is the influenza vaccine

00:37:46.920 --> 00:37:46.930
to talk about is the influenza vaccine
 

00:37:46.930 --> 00:37:49.000
to talk about is the influenza vaccine
influenza viruses are very different of

00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:49.010
influenza viruses are very different of
 

00:37:49.010 --> 00:37:51.400
influenza viruses are very different of
course there are below viruses with

00:37:51.400 --> 00:37:51.410
course there are below viruses with
 

00:37:51.410 --> 00:37:53.770
course there are below viruses with
glycoproteins in the envelope there are

00:37:53.770 --> 00:37:53.780
glycoproteins in the envelope there are
 

00:37:53.780 --> 00:37:56.440
glycoproteins in the envelope there are
three types of influenza A B and C and

00:37:56.440 --> 00:37:56.450
three types of influenza A B and C and
 

00:37:56.450 --> 00:38:00.099
three types of influenza A B and C and
there antigenically distinct so you have

00:38:00.099 --> 00:38:00.109
there antigenically distinct so you have
 

00:38:00.109 --> 00:38:01.960
there antigenically distinct so you have
to immunize against each one if you want

00:38:01.960 --> 00:38:01.970
to immunize against each one if you want
 

00:38:01.970 --> 00:38:04.660
to immunize against each one if you want
to protect against each one a and B are

00:38:04.660 --> 00:38:04.670
to protect against each one a and B are
 

00:38:04.670 --> 00:38:06.250
to protect against each one a and B are
the two that we immunize against they

00:38:06.250 --> 00:38:06.260
the two that we immunize against they
 

00:38:06.260 --> 00:38:08.290
the two that we immunize against they
cause the most serious disease C doesn't

00:38:08.290 --> 00:38:08.300
cause the most serious disease C doesn't
 

00:38:08.300 --> 00:38:10.270
cause the most serious disease C doesn't
cause significant enough disease to

00:38:10.270 --> 00:38:10.280
cause significant enough disease to
 

00:38:10.280 --> 00:38:14.079
cause significant enough disease to
require a vaccine the inactivated

00:38:14.079 --> 00:38:14.089
require a vaccine the inactivated
 

00:38:14.089 --> 00:38:16.810
require a vaccine the inactivated
influenza vaccine why do we have it well

00:38:16.810 --> 00:38:16.820
influenza vaccine why do we have it well
 

00:38:16.820 --> 00:38:18.940
influenza vaccine why do we have it well
because you get about 50,000 deaths per

00:38:18.940 --> 00:38:18.950
because you get about 50,000 deaths per
 

00:38:18.950 --> 00:38:21.460
because you get about 50,000 deaths per
year in the u.s. due to influenza it's a

00:38:21.460 --> 00:38:21.470
year in the u.s. due to influenza it's a
 

00:38:21.470 --> 00:38:24.450
year in the u.s. due to influenza it's a
lot of people dying and it really is is

00:38:24.450 --> 00:38:24.460
lot of people dying and it really is is
 

00:38:24.460 --> 00:38:27.430
lot of people dying and it really is is
surprising when people say you know flu

00:38:27.430 --> 00:38:27.440
surprising when people say you know flu
 

00:38:27.440 --> 00:38:29.500
surprising when people say you know flu
is not a serious disease I don't need to

00:38:29.500 --> 00:38:29.510
is not a serious disease I don't need to
 

00:38:29.510 --> 00:38:31.540
is not a serious disease I don't need to
be immunized well it's pretty serious

00:38:31.540 --> 00:38:31.550
be immunized well it's pretty serious
 

00:38:31.550 --> 00:38:32.810
be immunized well it's pretty serious
for those 50,000

00:38:32.810 --> 00:38:32.820
for those 50,000
 

00:38:32.820 --> 00:38:34.130
for those 50,000
people who died and how do you know

00:38:34.130 --> 00:38:34.140
people who died and how do you know
 

00:38:34.140 --> 00:38:35.840
people who died and how do you know
you're not going to be one of them so I

00:38:35.840 --> 00:38:35.850
you're not going to be one of them so I
 

00:38:35.850 --> 00:38:37.850
you're not going to be one of them so I
think that's it that's one reason to be

00:38:37.850 --> 00:38:37.860
think that's it that's one reason to be
 

00:38:37.860 --> 00:38:41.740
think that's it that's one reason to be
immunized so the vaccine is produced in

00:38:41.740 --> 00:38:41.750
immunized so the vaccine is produced in
 

00:38:41.750 --> 00:38:43.420
immunized so the vaccine is produced in
chicken eggs

00:38:43.420 --> 00:38:43.430
chicken eggs
 

00:38:43.430 --> 00:38:46.040
chicken eggs
the virus is inoculated into the vaccine

00:38:46.040 --> 00:38:46.050
the virus is inoculated into the vaccine
 

00:38:46.050 --> 00:38:47.810
the virus is inoculated into the vaccine
it grows in the egg and then they take

00:38:47.810 --> 00:38:47.820
it grows in the egg and then they take
 

00:38:47.820 --> 00:38:49.640
it grows in the egg and then they take
out the virus and inactivate it with

00:38:49.640 --> 00:38:49.650
out the virus and inactivate it with
 

00:38:49.650 --> 00:38:52.280
out the virus and inactivate it with
formalin and detergent disrupt it and

00:38:52.280 --> 00:38:52.290
formalin and detergent disrupt it and
 

00:38:52.290 --> 00:38:54.860
formalin and detergent disrupt it and
then this is immunized this is injected

00:38:54.860 --> 00:38:54.870
then this is immunized this is injected
 

00:38:54.870 --> 00:38:57.400
then this is immunized this is injected
into you there's currently a vaccine

00:38:57.400 --> 00:38:57.410
into you there's currently a vaccine
 

00:38:57.410 --> 00:39:00.740
into you there's currently a vaccine
produced in cell culture which is being

00:39:00.740 --> 00:39:00.750
produced in cell culture which is being
 

00:39:00.750 --> 00:39:02.870
produced in cell culture which is being
used in the European Union so if you

00:39:02.870 --> 00:39:02.880
used in the European Union so if you
 

00:39:02.880 --> 00:39:04.310
used in the European Union so if you
have an egg allergy you shouldn't get

00:39:04.310 --> 00:39:04.320
have an egg allergy you shouldn't get
 

00:39:04.320 --> 00:39:05.840
have an egg allergy you shouldn't get
flu vaccine grown in eggs

00:39:05.840 --> 00:39:05.850
flu vaccine grown in eggs
 

00:39:05.850 --> 00:39:08.360
flu vaccine grown in eggs
but eventually this vaccine will come to

00:39:08.360 --> 00:39:08.370
but eventually this vaccine will come to
 

00:39:08.370 --> 00:39:11.680
but eventually this vaccine will come to
the US and then you can get that as well

00:39:11.680 --> 00:39:11.690
the US and then you can get that as well
 

00:39:11.690 --> 00:39:14.300
the US and then you can get that as well
we make almost a hundred million doses a

00:39:14.300 --> 00:39:14.310
we make almost a hundred million doses a
 

00:39:14.310 --> 00:39:16.280
we make almost a hundred million doses a
year last year I think we made over 150

00:39:16.280 --> 00:39:16.290
year last year I think we made over 150
 

00:39:16.290 --> 00:39:18.830
year last year I think we made over 150
million doses in 2009 that is when the

00:39:18.830 --> 00:39:18.840
million doses in 2009 that is when the
 

00:39:18.840 --> 00:39:21.650
million doses in 2009 that is when the
recent pandemic emerged so we make a lot

00:39:21.650 --> 00:39:21.660
recent pandemic emerged so we make a lot
 

00:39:21.660 --> 00:39:24.800
recent pandemic emerged so we make a lot
of flu doses it's 60 to 90 percent

00:39:24.800 --> 00:39:24.810
of flu doses it's 60 to 90 percent
 

00:39:24.810 --> 00:39:28.850
of flu doses it's 60 to 90 percent
effective in children and adults below

00:39:28.850 --> 00:39:28.860
effective in children and adults below
 

00:39:28.860 --> 00:39:32.660
effective in children and adults below
65 years of age so 60% is not terribly

00:39:32.660 --> 00:39:32.670
65 years of age so 60% is not terribly
 

00:39:32.670 --> 00:39:34.940
65 years of age so 60% is not terribly
effective 60 people out of a hundred

00:39:34.940 --> 00:39:34.950
effective 60 people out of a hundred
 

00:39:34.950 --> 00:39:37.610
effective 60 people out of a hundred
would be protected so it's not the best

00:39:37.610 --> 00:39:37.620
would be protected so it's not the best
 

00:39:37.620 --> 00:39:39.440
would be protected so it's not the best
vaccine this is pretty old technology

00:39:39.440 --> 00:39:39.450
vaccine this is pretty old technology
 

00:39:39.450 --> 00:39:42.830
vaccine this is pretty old technology
and we need to improve it over 65 it's

00:39:42.830 --> 00:39:42.840
and we need to improve it over 65 it's
 

00:39:42.840 --> 00:39:45.260
and we need to improve it over 65 it's
really really poor protection which

00:39:45.260 --> 00:39:45.270
really really poor protection which
 

00:39:45.270 --> 00:39:47.540
really really poor protection which
doesn't even last an entire flu season

00:39:47.540 --> 00:39:47.550
doesn't even last an entire flu season
 

00:39:47.550 --> 00:39:49.880
doesn't even last an entire flu season
if if you you're over 65 you get

00:39:49.880 --> 00:39:49.890
if if you you're over 65 you get
 

00:39:49.890 --> 00:39:51.290
if if you you're over 65 you get
immunized in September which is

00:39:51.290 --> 00:39:51.300
immunized in September which is
 

00:39:51.300 --> 00:39:54.290
immunized in September which is
typically when you start immunizing by

00:39:54.290 --> 00:39:54.300
typically when you start immunizing by
 

00:39:54.300 --> 00:39:56.540
typically when you start immunizing by
the next January or February that

00:39:56.540 --> 00:39:56.550
the next January or February that
 

00:39:56.550 --> 00:39:58.580
the next January or February that
immunity is probably waned sufficiently

00:39:58.580 --> 00:39:58.590
immunity is probably waned sufficiently
 

00:39:58.590 --> 00:40:01.280
immunity is probably waned sufficiently
that they could get influenza by then so

00:40:01.280 --> 00:40:01.290
that they could get influenza by then so
 

00:40:01.290 --> 00:40:04.970
that they could get influenza by then so
we need to do some improving here what

00:40:04.970 --> 00:40:04.980
we need to do some improving here what
 

00:40:04.980 --> 00:40:06.950
we need to do some improving here what
the vaccine does is makes antibodies

00:40:06.950 --> 00:40:06.960
the vaccine does is makes antibodies
 

00:40:06.960 --> 00:40:09.350
the vaccine does is makes antibodies
against the - glycoproteins that are in

00:40:09.350 --> 00:40:09.360
against the - glycoproteins that are in
 

00:40:09.360 --> 00:40:12.350
against the - glycoproteins that are in
the virus particle DHA or the na and

00:40:12.350 --> 00:40:12.360
the virus particle DHA or the na and
 

00:40:12.360 --> 00:40:14.890
the virus particle DHA or the na and
that is what protects you from infection

00:40:14.890 --> 00:40:14.900
that is what protects you from infection
 

00:40:14.900 --> 00:40:17.480
that is what protects you from infection
the problem with this vaccine is you

00:40:17.480 --> 00:40:17.490
the problem with this vaccine is you
 

00:40:17.490 --> 00:40:18.940
the problem with this vaccine is you
have to change it every year or two

00:40:18.940 --> 00:40:18.950
have to change it every year or two
 

00:40:18.950 --> 00:40:22.280
have to change it every year or two
because the viral envelope genes change

00:40:22.280 --> 00:40:22.290
because the viral envelope genes change
 

00:40:22.290 --> 00:40:25.850
because the viral envelope genes change
and therefore we have to select new

00:40:25.850 --> 00:40:25.860
and therefore we have to select new
 

00:40:25.860 --> 00:40:27.590
and therefore we have to select new
strains that we think are going to

00:40:27.590 --> 00:40:27.600
strains that we think are going to
 

00:40:27.600 --> 00:40:30.410
strains that we think are going to
circulate every year and that's done at

00:40:30.410 --> 00:40:30.420
circulate every year and that's done at
 

00:40:30.420 --> 00:40:32.750
circulate every year and that's done at
the beginning of the year and decisions

00:40:32.750 --> 00:40:32.760
the beginning of the year and decisions
 

00:40:32.760 --> 00:40:34.160
the beginning of the year and decisions
are made because they have to go into

00:40:34.160 --> 00:40:34.170
are made because they have to go into
 

00:40:34.170 --> 00:40:36.710
are made because they have to go into
production and even starting in January

00:40:36.710 --> 00:40:36.720
production and even starting in January
 

00:40:36.720 --> 00:40:39.260
production and even starting in January
or February getting a vaccine out by

00:40:39.260 --> 00:40:39.270
or February getting a vaccine out by
 

00:40:39.270 --> 00:40:41.960
or February getting a vaccine out by
August is not easy but that's what

00:40:41.960 --> 00:40:41.970
August is not easy but that's what
 

00:40:41.970 --> 00:40:43.010
August is not easy but that's what
happens and then you can start

00:40:43.010 --> 00:40:43.020
happens and then you can start
 

00:40:43.020 --> 00:40:45.800
happens and then you can start
immunizing people in September the way

00:40:45.800 --> 00:40:45.810
immunizing people in September the way
 

00:40:45.810 --> 00:40:46.550
immunizing people in September the way
this is

00:40:46.550 --> 00:40:46.560
this is
 

00:40:46.560 --> 00:40:48.740
this is
because most isolates that you get from

00:40:48.740 --> 00:40:48.750
because most isolates that you get from
 

00:40:48.750 --> 00:40:50.570
because most isolates that you get from
people most virus isolates don't grow

00:40:50.570 --> 00:40:50.580
people most virus isolates don't grow
 

00:40:50.580 --> 00:40:52.880
people most virus isolates don't grow
very well what you do is you pick your

00:40:52.880 --> 00:40:52.890
very well what you do is you pick your
 

00:40:52.890 --> 00:40:54.740
very well what you do is you pick your
strain and then you make a reassortant

00:40:54.740 --> 00:40:54.750
strain and then you make a reassortant
 

00:40:54.750 --> 00:40:57.320
strain and then you make a reassortant
with a strain that you know grows really

00:40:57.320 --> 00:40:57.330
with a strain that you know grows really
 

00:40:57.330 --> 00:41:00.080
with a strain that you know grows really
well in eggs and then you make sure that

00:41:00.080 --> 00:41:00.090
well in eggs and then you make sure that
 

00:41:00.090 --> 00:41:02.720
well in eggs and then you make sure that
the genes for the H a and the na come

00:41:02.720 --> 00:41:02.730
the genes for the H a and the na come
 

00:41:02.730 --> 00:41:05.000
the genes for the H a and the na come
from the clinical isolate that you want

00:41:05.000 --> 00:41:05.010
from the clinical isolate that you want
 

00:41:05.010 --> 00:41:06.260
from the clinical isolate that you want
to protect against and then the all the

00:41:06.260 --> 00:41:06.270
to protect against and then the all the
 

00:41:06.270 --> 00:41:07.760
to protect against and then the all the
other ones come from the high yielding

00:41:07.760 --> 00:41:07.770
other ones come from the high yielding
 

00:41:07.770 --> 00:41:09.350
other ones come from the high yielding
strain so this is done every year you

00:41:09.350 --> 00:41:09.360
strain so this is done every year you
 

00:41:09.360 --> 00:41:11.810
strain so this is done every year you
make a reassortant and then you get that

00:41:11.810 --> 00:41:11.820
make a reassortant and then you get that
 

00:41:11.820 --> 00:41:15.380
make a reassortant and then you get that
to grow really well in eggs so the

00:41:15.380 --> 00:41:15.390
to grow really well in eggs so the
 

00:41:15.390 --> 00:41:17.440
to grow really well in eggs so the
current vaccine is a trivalent

00:41:17.440 --> 00:41:17.450
current vaccine is a trivalent
 

00:41:17.450 --> 00:41:20.090
current vaccine is a trivalent
preparation it has three components it

00:41:20.090 --> 00:41:20.100
preparation it has three components it
 

00:41:20.100 --> 00:41:23.510
preparation it has three components it
has a 2009 h1n1 strain this is the

00:41:23.510 --> 00:41:23.520
has a 2009 h1n1 strain this is the
 

00:41:23.520 --> 00:41:24.830
has a 2009 h1n1 strain this is the
strain that emerged that year the

00:41:24.830 --> 00:41:24.840
strain that emerged that year the
 

00:41:24.840 --> 00:41:27.590
strain that emerged that year the
pandemic swine origin influenza strain

00:41:27.590 --> 00:41:27.600
pandemic swine origin influenza strain
 

00:41:27.600 --> 00:41:30.800
pandemic swine origin influenza strain
there is also another type a strain an

00:41:30.800 --> 00:41:30.810
there is also another type a strain an
 

00:41:30.810 --> 00:41:33.650
there is also another type a strain an
h3n2 these viruses continue to circulate

00:41:33.650 --> 00:41:33.660
h3n2 these viruses continue to circulate
 

00:41:33.660 --> 00:41:36.140
h3n2 these viruses continue to circulate
and then there's an influenza B string

00:41:36.140 --> 00:41:36.150
and then there's an influenza B string
 

00:41:36.150 --> 00:41:44.210
and then there's an influenza B string
all right yes no it's not terribly cheap

00:41:44.210 --> 00:41:44.220
all right yes no it's not terribly cheap
 

00:41:44.220 --> 00:41:47.450
all right yes no it's not terribly cheap
it's not less than $1 per dose you need

00:41:47.450 --> 00:41:47.460
it's not less than $1 per dose you need
 

00:41:47.460 --> 00:41:50.720
it's not less than $1 per dose you need
one egg per per dose so that's a 150

00:41:50.720 --> 00:41:50.730
one egg per per dose so that's a 150
 

00:41:50.730 --> 00:41:52.850
one egg per per dose so that's a 150
million eggs you need and the production

00:41:52.850 --> 00:41:52.860
million eggs you need and the production
 

00:41:52.860 --> 00:41:55.550
million eggs you need and the production
is it's complicated the inoculation of

00:41:55.550 --> 00:41:55.560
is it's complicated the inoculation of
 

00:41:55.560 --> 00:41:57.260
is it's complicated the inoculation of
the eggs and the harvesting and the

00:41:57.260 --> 00:41:57.270
the eggs and the harvesting and the
 

00:41:57.270 --> 00:42:00.140
the eggs and the harvesting and the
inactivation so I I think the cell

00:42:00.140 --> 00:42:00.150
inactivation so I I think the cell
 

00:42:00.150 --> 00:42:01.760
inactivation so I I think the cell
culture of vaccine would be cheaper but

00:42:01.760 --> 00:42:01.770
culture of vaccine would be cheaper but
 

00:42:01.770 --> 00:42:03.680
culture of vaccine would be cheaper but
there's an even cheaper alternative

00:42:03.680 --> 00:42:03.690
there's an even cheaper alternative
 

00:42:03.690 --> 00:42:08.720
there's an even cheaper alternative
coming up which will talk about subunit

00:42:08.720 --> 00:42:08.730
coming up which will talk about subunit
 

00:42:08.730 --> 00:42:10.220
coming up which will talk about subunit
vaccines you break the virus into

00:42:10.220 --> 00:42:10.230
vaccines you break the virus into
 

00:42:10.230 --> 00:42:11.990
vaccines you break the virus into
components and then you immunize with

00:42:11.990 --> 00:42:12.000
components and then you immunize with
 

00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:15.170
components and then you immunize with
purified components one one version you

00:42:15.170 --> 00:42:15.180
purified components one one version you
 

00:42:15.180 --> 00:42:17.870
purified components one one version you
can clone the gene for let's say H a of

00:42:17.870 --> 00:42:17.880
can clone the gene for let's say H a of
 

00:42:17.880 --> 00:42:20.270
can clone the gene for let's say H a of
flu each clone it you express it

00:42:20.270 --> 00:42:20.280
flu each clone it you express it
 

00:42:20.280 --> 00:42:22.190
flu each clone it you express it

cell culture you have to decide what is

00:42:24.200 --> 00:42:24.210
cell culture you have to decide what is
 

00:42:24.210 --> 00:42:26.600
cell culture you have to decide what is
best that you purify the protein and use

00:42:26.600 --> 00:42:26.610
best that you purify the protein and use
 

00:42:26.610 --> 00:42:28.670
best that you purify the protein and use
that as an immunogen and typically the

00:42:28.670 --> 00:42:28.680
that as an immunogen and typically the
 

00:42:28.680 --> 00:42:30.500
that as an immunogen and typically the
antigen is a capsid protein or a

00:42:30.500 --> 00:42:30.510
antigen is a capsid protein or a
 

00:42:30.510 --> 00:42:33.380
antigen is a capsid protein or a
membrane protein which you know will

membrane protein which you know will
 

00:42:33.390 --> 00:42:36.020
membrane protein which you know will
provide protection antibodies against it

00:42:36.020 --> 00:42:36.030
provide protection antibodies against it
 

00:42:36.030 --> 00:42:39.620
provide protection antibodies against it
will provide protection subunit vaccines

00:42:39.620 --> 00:42:39.630
will provide protection subunit vaccines
 

00:42:39.630 --> 00:42:43.310
will provide protection subunit vaccines
have some advantages there are no viral

of contamination with infectious virus
 

00:42:50.160 --> 00:42:51.950
of contamination with infectious virus

contaminating it depending on how you
 

00:43:01.030 --> 00:43:02.700
contaminating it depending on how you
purify it but it's less likely to be

purify it but it's less likely to be
 

00:43:02.710 --> 00:43:04.650

well protein antigens don't do that very

00:43:56.730 --> 00:43:56.740
well protein antigens don't do that very
 

00:43:56.740 --> 00:43:58.950
well protein antigens don't do that very
well because they don't replicate and a

in a moment when you use a pure protein

00:44:14.820 --> 00:44:14.830
in a moment when you use a pure protein
 

00:44:14.830 --> 00:44:16.560
in a moment when you use a pure protein
as an image and you often require an

as an image and you often require an
 

00:44:16.570 --> 00:44:18.810
as an image and you often require an
adjuvant and what this does is to

00:44:18.810 --> 00:44:18.820
adjuvant and what this does is to
 

00:44:18.820 --> 00:44:20.640
adjuvant and what this does is to
stimulate inflammation remember

00:44:20.640 --> 00:44:20.650
stimulate inflammation remember
 

00:44:20.650 --> 00:44:22.560

doing this so we put adjuvant CIN to

00:44:31.860 --> 00:44:31.870
doing this so we put adjuvant CIN to
 

00:44:31.870 --> 00:44:34.680
doing this so we put adjuvant CIN to
make better inflammation and before we

00:44:34.680 --> 00:44:34.690
make better inflammation and before we
 

00:44:34.690 --> 00:44:36.270
make better inflammation and before we
talk about adjuvant so let me tell you a

00:44:36.270 --> 00:44:36.280
talk about adjuvant so let me tell you a
 

00:44:36.280 --> 00:44:38.280
talk about adjuvant so let me tell you a
little bit about this respiratory

virus disease so in a natural infection

00:44:53.550 --> 00:44:53.560
virus disease so in a natural infection
 

00:44:53.560 --> 00:44:55.530
virus disease so in a natural infection
with respiratory syncytial virus the

00:44:55.530 --> 00:44:55.540
with respiratory syncytial virus the
 

00:44:55.540 --> 00:44:58.320
with respiratory syncytial virus the
virus binds to toll-like receptors on

00:44:58.320 --> 00:44:58.330
virus binds to toll-like receptors on
 

00:44:58.330 --> 00:44:59.970
virus binds to toll-like receptors on
the cell surface and these are the

00:44:59.970 --> 00:44:59.980
the cell surface and these are the
 

00:44:59.980 --> 00:45:02.100
the cell surface and these are the
sensors of the innate immune system the

00:45:02.100 --> 00:45:02.110
sensors of the innate immune system the
 

00:45:02.110 --> 00:45:04.320
sensors of the innate immune system the
toll-like receptors say ah there's a

00:45:04.320 --> 00:45:04.330
toll-like receptors say ah there's a
 

00:45:04.330 --> 00:45:07.140
toll-like receptors say ah there's a
foreign virus here they signal the

00:45:07.140 --> 00:45:07.150
foreign virus here they signal the
 

00:45:07.150 --> 00:45:09.210
foreign virus here they signal the
innate immune system in addition when

00:45:09.210 --> 00:45:09.220
innate immune system in addition when
 

00:45:09.220 --> 00:45:10.710
innate immune system in addition when
the virus gets into cells it makes

00:45:10.710 --> 00:45:10.720
the virus gets into cells it makes
 

00:45:10.720 --> 00:45:13.280
the virus gets into cells it makes
double-stranded RNA which is also sensed

00:45:13.280 --> 00:45:13.290
double-stranded RNA which is also sensed
 

00:45:13.290 --> 00:45:16.280
double-stranded RNA which is also sensed
and all of these things make it really

00:45:16.280 --> 00:45:16.290
and all of these things make it really
 

00:45:16.290 --> 00:45:18.020
and all of these things make it really
strong and eight response and

00:45:18.020 --> 00:45:18.030
strong and eight response and
 

00:45:18.030 --> 00:45:21.350
strong and eight response and
consequently a great adaptive response

00:45:21.350 --> 00:45:21.360
consequently a great adaptive response
 

00:45:21.360 --> 00:45:23.630
consequently a great adaptive response
which means really good antibody

00:45:23.630 --> 00:45:23.640
which means really good antibody
 

00:45:23.640 --> 00:45:25.520
which means really good antibody

antibodies so the innate responses is

00:45:27.950 --> 00:45:27.960
antibodies so the innate responses is
 

00:45:27.960 --> 00:45:29.570
antibodies so the innate responses is
crucial for getting really good

00:45:29.570 --> 00:45:29.580
crucial for getting really good
 

00:45:29.580 --> 00:45:32.120
crucial for getting really good
antibodies when they made the vaccine

00:45:32.120 --> 00:45:32.130
antibodies when they made the vaccine
 

00:45:32.130 --> 00:45:34.430
antibodies when they made the vaccine
they inactivated with formalin and they

00:45:34.430 --> 00:45:34.440
they inactivated with formalin and they
 

00:45:34.440 --> 00:45:36.200
they inactivated with formalin and they
didn't know this at the time but it

00:45:36.200 --> 00:45:36.210
didn't know this at the time but it
 

00:45:36.210 --> 00:45:38.690
didn't know this at the time but it
turned out to be a really poor ligand

00:45:38.690 --> 00:45:38.700
turned out to be a really poor ligand
 

00:45:38.700 --> 00:45:41.750
turned out to be a really poor ligand
for the toll-like receptors it no longer

00:45:41.750 --> 00:45:41.760
for the toll-like receptors it no longer
 

00:45:41.760 --> 00:45:44.300
for the toll-like receptors it no longer
stimulated toll-like receptors so you've

00:45:44.300 --> 00:45:44.310
stimulated toll-like receptors so you've
 

00:45:44.310 --> 00:45:46.520
stimulated toll-like receptors so you've
got very poor innate responses to this

00:45:46.520 --> 00:45:46.530
got very poor innate responses to this
 

00:45:46.530 --> 00:45:49.130
got very poor innate responses to this
vaccine and you got very low affinity

00:45:49.130 --> 00:45:49.140
vaccine and you got very low affinity
 

00:45:49.140 --> 00:45:52.310
vaccine and you got very low affinity
antibodies produced so just because the

00:45:52.310 --> 00:45:52.320
antibodies produced so just because the
 

00:45:52.320 --> 00:45:54.710
antibodies produced so just because the
innate response wasn't stimulated you've

00:45:54.710 --> 00:45:54.720
innate response wasn't stimulated you've
 

00:45:54.720 --> 00:45:56.960
innate response wasn't stimulated you've
got really bad antibodies these bound

00:45:56.960 --> 00:45:56.970
got really bad antibodies these bound
 

00:45:56.970 --> 00:45:58.790
got really bad antibodies these bound
the virus but they didn't neutralize it

00:45:58.790 --> 00:45:58.800
the virus but they didn't neutralize it
 

00:45:58.800 --> 00:46:00.860
the virus but they didn't neutralize it
and in fact they led to uptake of the

00:46:00.860 --> 00:46:00.870
and in fact they led to uptake of the
 

00:46:00.870 --> 00:46:03.770
and in fact they led to uptake of the
virus into FC receptor bearing cells

00:46:03.770 --> 00:46:03.780
virus into FC receptor bearing cells
 

00:46:03.780 --> 00:46:05.990

very much like dengue and more severe
 

00:46:06.000 --> 00:46:09.260
very much like dengue and more severe
disease okay so now we know that the

00:46:09.260 --> 00:46:09.270
disease okay so now we know that the
 

00:46:09.270 --> 00:46:11.150
disease okay so now we know that the
problem is toll-like receptor

00:46:11.150 --> 00:46:11.160
problem is toll-like receptor
 

00:46:11.160 --> 00:46:12.770
problem is toll-like receptor
stimulating and we can make a vaccine

00:46:12.770 --> 00:46:12.780

they make better inflammation right all

00:46:27.020 --> 00:46:27.030
they make better inflammation right all
 

00:46:27.030 --> 00:46:28.880
they make better inflammation right all
those signals of inflammation the

00:46:28.880 --> 00:46:28.890
those signals of inflammation the
 

00:46:28.890 --> 00:46:30.650
those signals of inflammation the
cytokines released they help make better

00:50:37.180 --> 00:50:39.360
you take a virus and you'd grow it in
certain conditions and hope that at some

00:50:39.360 --> 00:50:39.370
certain conditions and hope that at some
 

00:50:39.370 --> 00:50:42.330
certain conditions and hope that at some
point you lose virulence of the virus so

00:50:42.330 --> 00:50:42.340
point you lose virulence of the virus so
 

00:50:42.340 --> 00:50:44.490
point you lose virulence of the virus so
here's an example you take a pathogenic

00:50:44.490 --> 00:50:44.500
here's an example you take a pathogenic
 

00:50:44.500 --> 00:50:47.070
here's an example you take a pathogenic
virus from a patient you grow it in

00:50:47.070 --> 00:50:47.080
virus from a patient you grow it in
 

00:50:47.080 --> 00:50:49.320
virus from a patient you grow it in
cultured cells and you may grow it in

00:50:49.320 --> 00:50:49.330
cultured cells and you may grow it in
 

00:50:49.330 --> 00:50:51.570
cultured cells and you may grow it in
another kind of cell and as you grow it

00:50:51.570 --> 00:50:51.580
another kind of cell and as you grow it
 

00:50:51.580 --> 00:50:53.280
another kind of cell and as you grow it
in cell to cell the virus acquires

00:50:53.280 --> 00:50:53.290
in cell to cell the virus acquires
 

00:50:53.290 --> 00:50:55.110
in cell to cell the virus acquires
mutations say that make it grow better

doesn't grow well and it may be a
 

00:51:02.170 --> 00:51:03.720
doesn't grow well and it may be a
candidate for a vaccine so this is a

00:51:03.720 --> 00:51:03.730
candidate for a vaccine so this is a
 

00:51:03.730 --> 00:51:05.910

to show that you could grow polio and

00:51:44.340 --> 00:51:44.350
to show that you could grow polio and
 

00:51:44.350 --> 00:51:46.320
to show that you could grow polio and
cell culture showed that you could pass

00:51:46.320 --> 00:51:46.330
cell culture showed that you could pass
 

00:51:46.330 --> 00:51:49.050
cell culture showed that you could pass
the virus in cell culture and it would

plaque purifications and at each step he

00:52:31.079 --> 00:52:31.089
plaque purifications and at each step he
 

00:52:31.089 --> 00:52:32.910
plaque purifications and at each step he
would take this virus and inject it into

00:52:32.910 --> 00:52:32.920
would take this virus and inject it into
 

00:52:32.920 --> 00:52:35.400
would take this virus and inject it into
monkeys and ask is it pathogenic and

00:52:35.400 --> 00:52:35.410
monkeys and ask is it pathogenic and
 

00:52:35.410 --> 00:52:38.009
monkeys and ask is it pathogenic and
eventually he got a virus that wasn't

00:52:38.009 --> 00:52:38.019
eventually he got a virus that wasn't
 

00:52:38.019 --> 00:52:39.989
eventually he got a virus that wasn't
and that became the vaccine strain oh

00:52:39.989 --> 00:52:39.999
and that became the vaccine strain oh
 

00:52:39.999 --> 00:52:41.460
and that became the vaccine strain oh
this of course is done in the 1950s

thing he knew was when you injected into

00:52:47.579 --> 00:52:47.589
thing he knew was when you injected into
 

00:52:47.589 --> 00:52:50.160

a monkey it did not cause paralysis and

00:52:50.160 --> 00:52:50.170
a monkey it did not cause paralysis and
 

00:52:50.170 --> 00:52:52.349
a monkey it did not cause paralysis and
eventually these were put into people in

00:52:52.349 --> 00:52:52.359
eventually these were put into people in
 

00:52:52.359 --> 00:52:55.109
eventually these were put into people in
clinical trials and these were the polio

00:52:55.109 --> 00:52:55.119
clinical trials and these were the polio
 

00:52:55.119 --> 00:52:57.239
clinical trials and these were the polio
virus vaccines now in the 1980s when we

00:52:57.239 --> 00:52:57.249
virus vaccines now in the 1980s when we
 

00:52:57.249 --> 00:52:59.999
virus vaccines now in the 1980s when we
got the ability to sequence DNA and

00:52:59.999 --> 00:53:00.009
got the ability to sequence DNA and
 

00:53:00.009 --> 00:53:02.789
got the ability to sequence DNA and
other genomes we then could sequence

00:53:02.789 --> 00:53:02.799
other genomes we then could sequence
 

00:53:02.799 --> 00:53:05.190
other genomes we then could sequence
Sabin strains and ask how did they

00:53:05.190 --> 00:53:05.200
Sabin strains and ask how did they
 

00:53:05.200 --> 00:53:07.380
Sabin strains and ask how did they
differ from the viruses that he started

00:53:07.380 --> 00:53:07.390
differ from the viruses that he started
 

00:53:07.390 --> 00:53:10.229
differ from the viruses that he started
with and that's shown here in fact there

00:53:10.229 --> 00:53:10.239
with and that's shown here in fact there
 

00:53:10.239 --> 00:53:12.420
with and that's shown here in fact there
are very few changes in these vaccine

00:53:12.420 --> 00:53:12.430
are very few changes in these vaccine
 

00:53:12.430 --> 00:53:15.089
are very few changes in these vaccine
strains compared to the viruses that he

strains compared to the viruses that he
 

00:53:15.099 --> 00:53:17.759
strains compared to the viruses that he
made them from in fact there are two of

00:53:17.759 --> 00:53:17.769
made them from in fact there are two of
 

00:53:17.769 --> 00:53:19.349
made them from in fact there are two of
the three serotypes there are only two

00:53:19.349 --> 00:53:19.359
the three serotypes there are only two
 

00:53:19.359 --> 00:53:22.950
the three serotypes there are only two
changes and if we were licensing this

00:53:22.950 --> 00:53:22.960
changes and if we were licensing this
 

00:53:22.960 --> 00:53:25.019
changes and if we were licensing this
vaccine today the FDA would look at this

00:53:25.019 --> 00:53:25.029
vaccine today the FDA would look at this
 

00:53:25.029 --> 00:53:27.239
vaccine today the FDA would look at this
and say not enough changes you can't

00:53:27.239 --> 00:53:27.249
and say not enough changes you can't
 

00:53:27.249 --> 00:53:30.239
and say not enough changes you can't
have this as a vaccine but back then we

00:53:30.239 --> 00:53:30.249
have this as a vaccine but back then we
 

00:53:30.249 --> 00:53:31.739
have this as a vaccine but back then we
didn't have sequencing so they were

00:53:31.739 --> 00:53:31.749
didn't have sequencing so they were
 

00:53:31.749 --> 00:53:35.069
didn't have sequencing so they were
licensed well all three of these

00:53:35.069 --> 00:53:35.079
licensed well all three of these
 

00:53:35.079 --> 00:53:37.470
licensed well all three of these

attenuate the virulence of poliovirus so
 

00:54:18.460 --> 00:54:20.819
attenuate the virulence of poliovirus so
this virus is ingested this vaccine you

00:54:20.819 --> 00:54:20.829
this virus is ingested this vaccine you
 

00:54:20.829 --> 00:54:22.680
this virus is ingested this vaccine you
drink you'd get a little bit of liquid

00:54:22.680 --> 00:54:22.690
drink you'd get a little bit of liquid
 

00:54:22.690 --> 00:54:25.470
drink you'd get a little bit of liquid
in a capsule you drink it it goes to

00:54:25.470 --> 00:54:25.480
in a capsule you drink it it goes to
 

00:54:25.480 --> 00:54:27.630
in a capsule you drink it it goes to
your intestine it multiplies there you

00:54:27.630 --> 00:54:27.640
your intestine it multiplies there you
 

00:54:27.640 --> 00:54:29.999
your intestine it multiplies there you
get nice intestinal immunity that mimics

00:54:29.999 --> 00:54:30.009
get nice intestinal immunity that mimics
 

00:54:30.009 --> 00:54:32.849
get nice intestinal immunity that mimics
a real infection the virus also gets

00:54:32.849 --> 00:54:32.859
a real infection the virus also gets
 

00:54:32.859 --> 00:54:34.349
a real infection the virus also gets
into your blood where it makes

00:54:34.349 --> 00:54:34.359
into your blood where it makes
 

00:54:34.359 --> 00:54:36.900
into your blood where it makes
antibodies in memory there as well and

00:54:36.900 --> 00:54:36.910
antibodies in memory there as well and
 

00:54:36.910 --> 00:54:39.120
antibodies in memory there as well and
then you are protected from infection

00:54:39.120 --> 00:54:39.130
then you are protected from infection
 

00:54:39.130 --> 00:54:42.599
then you are protected from infection
and as OPV remember only protected your

00:54:42.599 --> 00:54:42.609
and as OPV remember only protected your
 

00:54:42.609 --> 00:54:45.539
and as OPV remember only protected your
blood from circulation of virus OPV does

00:54:45.539 --> 00:54:45.549
blood from circulation of virus OPV does
 

00:54:45.549 --> 00:54:47.700
blood from circulation of virus OPV does
both it blocks infection at the mucosal

00:54:47.700 --> 00:54:47.710
both it blocks infection at the mucosal
 

00:54:47.710 --> 00:54:52.370
both it blocks infection at the mucosal
surface and within the blood now the

inactivated vaccine was supplanted by

00:54:55.309 --> 00:54:55.319
inactivated vaccine was supplanted by
 

00:54:55.319 --> 00:55:00.480
inactivated vaccine was supplanted by
the oral vaccine in 1961 that led to the

00:55:00.480 --> 00:55:00.490
the oral vaccine in 1961 that led to the
 

00:55:00.490 --> 00:55:04.759
the oral vaccine in 1961 that led to the
elimination of polio in the US

00:55:04.759 --> 00:55:04.769
elimination of polio in the US
 

00:55:04.769 --> 00:55:07.529
elimination of polio in the US
unfortunately the vaccine though in 10

you ated vaccine can also cause polio

00:55:10.049 --> 00:55:10.059
you ated vaccine can also cause polio
 

00:55:10.059 --> 00:55:12.710
you ated vaccine can also cause polio
this is called vaccine associated polio

00:55:12.710 --> 00:55:12.720
this is called vaccine associated polio
 

00:55:12.720 --> 00:55:15.630
this is called vaccine associated polio
and it was recognized actually from its

excrete in their stools is more neuro
 

00:55:23.440 --> 00:55:25.920
excrete in their stools is more neuro
virulent than what you give them so you

00:55:25.920 --> 00:55:25.930
virulent than what you give them so you
 

00:55:25.930 --> 00:55:28.109
virulent than what you give them so you
can feed people polio vaccine you take

00:55:28.109 --> 00:55:28.119
can feed people polio vaccine you take
 

00:55:28.119 --> 00:55:30.150
can feed people polio vaccine you take
what they shed you put that into monkeys

00:55:30.150 --> 00:55:30.160
what they shed you put that into monkeys
 

00:55:30.160 --> 00:55:32.400
what they shed you put that into monkeys
and that's more neuro virulent than what

00:55:32.400 --> 00:55:32.410
and that's more neuro virulent than what

individuals with them and as we
eliminated polio from the US the last

00:55:47.069 --> 00:55:47.079
eliminated polio from the US the last
 

00:55:47.079 --> 00:55:51.380
eliminated polio from the US the last
case of wild polio in the US was 1979

00:55:51.380 --> 00:55:51.390
case of wild polio in the US was 1979
 

00:55:51.390 --> 00:55:55.950
case of wild polio in the US was 1979
after that the only polio in the US was

00:55:55.950 --> 00:55:55.960
after that the only polio in the US was
 

00:55:55.960 --> 00:55:58.650
after that the only polio in the US was

one point four million doses of vaccine
 

00:56:04.920 --> 00:56:06.839
one point four million doses of vaccine
distributed they were about seven to

00:56:06.839 --> 00:56:06.849
distributed they were about seven to
 

00:56:06.849 --> 00:56:09.599
distributed they were about seven to
eight such cases per year in the US and

00:56:09.599 --> 00:56:09.609
eight such cases per year in the US and
 

00:56:09.609 --> 00:56:12.660
eight such cases per year in the US and
that's why by 2000 we decided to switch

00:56:12.660 --> 00:56:12.670
that's why by 2000 we decided to switch
 

00:56:12.670 --> 00:56:14.849
that's why by 2000 we decided to switch
back to the inactivated vaccine because

00:56:14.849 --> 00:56:14.859
back to the inactivated vaccine because
 

00:56:14.859 --> 00:56:17.430
back to the inactivated vaccine because
the only polio was caused by the vaccine

00:56:17.430 --> 00:56:17.440
the only polio was caused by the vaccine
 

00:56:17.440 --> 00:56:18.749
the only polio was caused by the vaccine
itself which obviously was not

00:56:18.749 --> 00:56:18.759
itself which obviously was not
 

00:56:18.759 --> 00:56:20.800
itself which obviously was not
acceptable

00:56:20.800 --> 00:56:20.810
acceptable
 

00:56:20.810 --> 00:56:23.210
acceptable
and so this is a nice graph which shows

00:56:23.210 --> 00:56:23.220
and so this is a nice graph which shows
 

00:56:23.220 --> 00:56:26.630
and so this is a nice graph which shows
you the progress of polio eradication in

00:56:26.630 --> 00:56:26.640
you the progress of polio eradication in
 

00:56:26.640 --> 00:56:29.030
you the progress of polio eradication in
the u.s. these are this is the number of

00:56:29.030 --> 00:56:29.040
the u.s. these are this is the number of
 

00:56:29.040 --> 00:56:31.280
the u.s. these are this is the number of
paralytic cases here on the y-axis and

00:56:31.280 --> 00:56:31.290
paralytic cases here on the y-axis and
 

00:56:31.290 --> 00:56:33.800
paralytic cases here on the y-axis and
this is the year so we're starting in

00:56:33.800 --> 00:56:33.810
this is the year so we're starting in
 

00:56:33.810 --> 00:56:37.130
this is the year so we're starting in
1961 these bars are the vaccine

00:56:37.130 --> 00:56:37.140
1961 these bars are the vaccine
 

00:56:37.140 --> 00:56:39.620
1961 these bars are the vaccine
associated polio cases so the black bars

00:56:39.620 --> 00:56:39.630
associated polio cases so the black bars
 

00:56:39.630 --> 00:56:41.660
associated polio cases so the black bars
are that polio case is caused by the

00:56:41.660 --> 00:56:41.670
are that polio case is caused by the
 

00:56:41.670 --> 00:56:45.020
are that polio case is caused by the
vaccine the line is the total number of

00:56:45.020 --> 00:56:45.030
vaccine the line is the total number of
 

00:56:45.030 --> 00:56:47.060
vaccine the line is the total number of
polio in the US so you can see in the

00:56:47.060 --> 00:56:47.070
polio in the US so you can see in the
 

00:56:47.070 --> 00:56:49.910
polio in the US so you can see in the
early 60s there was a lot more wild

00:56:49.910 --> 00:56:49.920
early 60s there was a lot more wild
 

00:56:49.920 --> 00:56:52.370
early 60s there was a lot more wild
polio but then as we eliminated

00:56:52.370 --> 00:56:52.380
polio but then as we eliminated
 

00:56:52.380 --> 00:56:54.440
polio but then as we eliminated
indigenous polio here's the last case in

00:56:54.440 --> 00:56:54.450
indigenous polio here's the last case in
 

00:56:54.450 --> 00:56:58.310
indigenous polio here's the last case in
1979 20 cases in an Amish community in

00:56:58.310 --> 00:56:58.320
1979 20 cases in an Amish community in
 

00:56:58.320 --> 00:56:59.390
1979 20 cases in an Amish community in
Pennsylvania

00:56:59.390 --> 00:56:59.400
Pennsylvania
 

00:56:59.400 --> 00:57:02.600
Pennsylvania
then 1980 on on no more wild polio the

00:57:02.600 --> 00:57:02.610
then 1980 on on no more wild polio the
 

00:57:02.610 --> 00:57:05.210
then 1980 on on no more wild polio the
only polio was caused by the vaccine so

00:57:05.210 --> 00:57:05.220
only polio was caused by the vaccine so
 

00:57:05.220 --> 00:57:08.180
only polio was caused by the vaccine so
2000 we switched to the killed vaccine

00:57:08.180 --> 00:57:08.190
2000 we switched to the killed vaccine
 

00:57:08.190 --> 00:57:12.860
2000 we switched to the killed vaccine
now no more polio in the u.s. why does

00:57:12.860 --> 00:57:12.870
now no more polio in the u.s. why does
 

00:57:12.870 --> 00:57:16.280
now no more polio in the u.s. why does
the vaccine cause polio because when you

00:57:16.280 --> 00:57:16.290
the vaccine cause polio because when you
 

00:57:16.290 --> 00:57:18.710
the vaccine cause polio because when you
ingest it it replicates in your

00:57:18.710 --> 00:57:18.720
ingest it it replicates in your
 

00:57:18.720 --> 00:57:21.530
ingest it it replicates in your
intestine and it rapidly reverts so

00:57:21.530 --> 00:57:21.540
intestine and it rapidly reverts so
 

00:57:21.540 --> 00:57:24.770
intestine and it rapidly reverts so
those few mutations remember that Albert

the lab and he scraped off the feces and
 

00:57:56.130 --> 00:57:58.490
the lab and he scraped off the feces and
isolated polio from it and sequenced it

00:57:58.490 --> 00:57:58.500
isolated polio from it and sequenced it
 

00:57:58.500 --> 00:58:01.760

you don't like needles this is also made

00:59:38.060 --> 00:59:38.070
you don't like needles this is also made
 

00:59:38.070 --> 00:59:39.350
you don't like needles this is also made
in eggs though so if you have egg

00:59:39.350 --> 00:59:39.360
in eggs though so if you have egg
 

00:59:39.360 --> 00:59:42.290
in eggs though so if you have egg
allergies you can't get it but it has an

strains that are in it it is also

00:59:47.000 --> 00:59:47.010
strains that are in it it is also
 

00:59:47.010 --> 00:59:50.270
strains that are in it it is also
reassortant of a master donor strain so

00:59:50.270 --> 00:59:50.280
reassortant of a master donor strain so
 

00:59:50.280 --> 00:59:53.630
reassortant of a master donor strain so
this master donor was developed by

00:59:53.630 --> 00:59:53.640
this master donor was developed by
 

00:59:53.640 --> 00:59:57.680
this master donor was developed by
passing virus at low temperature until

00:59:57.680 --> 00:59:57.690
passing virus at low temperature until
 

00:59:57.690 --> 00:59:59.720
passing virus at low temperature until
it replicated really well at low

00:59:59.720 --> 00:59:59.730
it replicated really well at low
 

00:59:59.730 --> 01:00:01.730
it replicated really well at low
temperature but not at higher

01:00:01.730 --> 01:00:01.740
temperature but not at higher
 

01:00:01.740 --> 01:00:04.160
temperature but not at higher
temperatures and then what you do is you

01:00:04.160 --> 01:00:04.170
temperatures and then what you do is you
 

01:00:04.170 --> 01:00:07.970
temperatures and then what you do is you
reassert the strain so that you have the

01:00:07.970 --> 01:00:07.980
reassert the strain so that you have the
 

01:00:07.980 --> 01:00:09.950
reassert the strain so that you have the
genes for the H a and na from whatever

01:00:09.950 --> 01:00:09.960
genes for the H a and na from whatever
 

01:00:09.960 --> 01:00:11.480
genes for the H a and na from whatever
your current strain is you make a

01:00:11.480 --> 01:00:11.490
your current strain is you make a
 

01:00:11.490 --> 01:00:14.090
your current strain is you make a
reassortant and these viruses are cold

01:00:14.090 --> 01:00:14.100
reassortant and these viruses are cold
 

01:00:14.100 --> 01:00:16.100
reassortant and these viruses are cold
adapted in temperature sensitive so they

01:00:16.100 --> 01:00:16.110
adapted in temperature sensitive so they
 

01:00:16.110 --> 01:00:18.710
adapted in temperature sensitive so they
prefer multiplying at a low temperature

01:00:18.710 --> 01:00:18.720
prefer multiplying at a low temperature
 

01:00:18.720 --> 01:00:21.020
prefer multiplying at a low temperature
which is your upper tract they don't go

01:00:21.020 --> 01:00:21.030
which is your upper tract they don't go
 

01:00:21.030 --> 01:00:22.430
which is your upper tract they don't go
into your lung because once they go

01:00:22.430 --> 01:00:22.440
into your lung because once they go
 

01:00:22.440 --> 01:00:23.780
into your lung because once they go
there the temperature is too high and

01:00:23.780 --> 01:00:23.790
there the temperature is too high and
 

01:00:23.790 --> 01:00:25.640
there the temperature is too high and
they don't replicate so that's why they

01:00:25.640 --> 01:00:25.650
they don't replicate so that's why they
 

01:00:25.650 --> 01:00:27.230
they don't replicate so that's why they
don't cause disease they stay up in the

01:00:27.230 --> 01:00:27.240
don't cause disease they stay up in the
 

01:00:27.240 --> 01:00:31.640
don't cause disease they stay up in the
upper tract and give you immunity so

01:00:31.640 --> 01:00:31.650
upper tract and give you immunity so
 

01:00:31.650 --> 01:00:33.110
upper tract and give you immunity so
they're cold adapted temperature

01:00:33.110 --> 01:00:33.120
they're cold adapted temperature
 

01:00:33.120 --> 01:00:35.890
they're cold adapted temperature
sensitive they replicate only your

nasopharyngitis oh these are limited in
 

01:00:39.930 --> 01:00:41.390
nasopharyngitis oh these are limited in
their distribution because a lot of

01:00:41.390 --> 01:00:41.400
their distribution because a lot of
 

01:00:41.400 --> 01:00:43.460

doses are not made yet but eventually I

01:00:43.460 --> 01:00:43.470
doses are not made yet but eventually I
 

01:00:43.470 --> 01:00:45.410
doses are not made yet but eventually I
think more and more of this will be made

01:00:45.410 --> 01:00:45.420
think more and more of this will be made
 

01:00:45.420 --> 01:00:47.180
think more and more of this will be made
especially as we move

01:00:47.180 --> 01:00:47.190
especially as we move
 

01:00:47.190 --> 01:00:50.359
especially as we move
to the cell culture production this is

01:00:50.359 --> 01:00:50.369
to the cell culture production this is
 

01:00:50.369 --> 01:00:52.069
to the cell culture production this is
just to show you how these strains are

01:00:52.069 --> 01:00:52.079
just to show you how these strains are
 

01:00:52.079 --> 01:00:54.740
just to show you how these strains are
isolated it's it's complicated so you

01:00:54.740 --> 01:00:54.750
isolated it's it's complicated so you
 

01:00:54.750 --> 01:00:57.290
isolated it's it's complicated so you
start with a parental virus that is

01:00:57.290 --> 01:00:57.300
start with a parental virus that is
 

01:00:57.300 --> 01:00:59.990
start with a parental virus that is
whatever virus you want to immunize

01:00:59.990 --> 01:01:00.000
whatever virus you want to immunize
 

01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:02.000
whatever virus you want to immunize
against then you have this master donor

01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:02.010
against then you have this master donor
 

01:01:02.010 --> 01:01:03.980
against then you have this master donor
virus which is cold adapted and

01:01:03.980 --> 01:01:03.990
virus which is cold adapted and
 

01:01:03.990 --> 01:01:05.990

these are reassortant and then you

01:01:15.079 --> 01:01:15.089
these are reassortant and then you
 

01:01:15.089 --> 01:01:18.079
these are reassortant and then you
select for viruses with the H a NN a of

01:01:18.079 --> 01:01:18.089
select for viruses with the H a NN a of
 

01:01:18.089 --> 01:01:19.609
select for viruses with the H a NN a of
your virus and and everything else from

01:01:19.609 --> 01:01:19.619
your virus and and everything else from
 

01:01:19.619 --> 01:01:21.050
your virus and and everything else from
this donor strain you go through a

01:01:21.050 --> 01:01:21.060
this donor strain you go through a
 

01:01:21.060 --> 01:01:23.809
this donor strain you go through a
number of egg passages and harvests and

01:01:23.809 --> 01:01:23.819
number of egg passages and harvests and
 

01:01:23.819 --> 01:01:26.000
number of egg passages and harvests and
eventually you you make a big bulk

01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:26.010
eventually you you make a big bulk
 

01:01:26.010 --> 01:01:29.210
eventually you you make a big bulk
process and you get your vaccine so it's

01:01:29.210 --> 01:01:29.220
process and you get your vaccine so it's
 

01:01:29.220 --> 01:01:31.220
process and you get your vaccine so it's
a complicated process which is why it's

01:01:31.220 --> 01:01:31.230
a complicated process which is why it's
 

01:01:31.230 --> 01:01:33.740
a complicated process which is why it's
not cheap now what about future vaccines

01:01:33.740 --> 01:01:33.750
not cheap now what about future vaccines
 

01:01:33.750 --> 01:01:35.599
not cheap now what about future vaccines
are for flu this is one that I really

01:01:35.599 --> 01:01:35.609
are for flu this is one that I really
 

01:01:35.609 --> 01:01:37.790
are for flu this is one that I really
like and this is one you can make in

01:01:37.790 --> 01:01:37.800
like and this is one you can make in
 

01:01:37.800 --> 01:01:41.690
like and this is one you can make in
plants so if you just express the H a of

01:01:41.690 --> 01:01:41.700
plants so if you just express the H a of
 

01:01:41.700 --> 01:01:44.150
plants so if you just express the H a of
influenza virus in cells the H a that

01:01:44.150 --> 01:01:44.160
influenza virus in cells the H a that
 

01:01:44.160 --> 01:01:46.849
influenza virus in cells the H a that
glycoprotein on the surface what you get

01:01:46.849 --> 01:01:46.859
glycoprotein on the surface what you get
 

01:01:46.859 --> 01:01:50.210
glycoprotein on the surface what you get
are particles made like this the H a is

01:01:50.210 --> 01:01:50.220
are particles made like this the H a is
 

01:01:50.220 --> 01:01:52.849
are particles made like this the H a is
enough to stimulate budding of a

01:01:52.849 --> 01:01:52.859
enough to stimulate budding of a
 

01:01:52.859 --> 01:01:54.530
enough to stimulate budding of a
membrane particle that has the H a

01:01:54.530 --> 01:01:54.540
membrane particle that has the H a
 

01:01:54.540 --> 01:01:56.540
membrane particle that has the H a
glycoprotein embedded in it so these are

01:01:56.540 --> 01:01:56.550
glycoprotein embedded in it so these are
 

01:01:56.550 --> 01:01:58.670
glycoprotein embedded in it so these are
virus-like particles and these are quite

01:01:58.670 --> 01:01:58.680
virus-like particles and these are quite
 

01:01:58.680 --> 01:02:01.250
virus-like particles and these are quite
immuno genic and they can protect you

01:02:01.250 --> 01:02:01.260
immuno genic and they can protect you
 

01:02:01.260 --> 01:02:04.370
immuno genic and they can protect you
against influenza this can also be done

01:02:04.370 --> 01:02:04.380
against influenza this can also be done
 

01:02:04.380 --> 01:02:07.520
against influenza this can also be done
in plants you can express the H a of flu

01:02:07.520 --> 01:02:07.530
in plants you can express the H a of flu
 

01:02:07.530 --> 01:02:09.950
in plants you can express the H a of flu
in a plant and this is very cheap when

01:02:09.950 --> 01:02:09.960
in a plant and this is very cheap when
 

01:02:09.960 --> 01:02:12.290
in a plant and this is very cheap when
you do this one square meter of plants

01:02:12.290 --> 01:02:12.300
you do this one square meter of plants
 

01:02:12.300 --> 01:02:14.809
you do this one square meter of plants
makes twenty thousand doses of vaccine

01:02:14.809 --> 01:02:14.819
makes twenty thousand doses of vaccine
 

01:02:14.819 --> 01:02:16.490
makes twenty thousand doses of vaccine
so this is like a square meter this

01:02:16.490 --> 01:02:16.500
so this is like a square meter this
 

01:02:16.500 --> 01:02:18.260
so this is like a square meter this
thing right here and they do this in

01:02:18.260 --> 01:02:18.270
thing right here and they do this in
 

01:02:18.270 --> 01:02:20.480
thing right here and they do this in
tobacco plants because tobacco plants

01:02:20.480 --> 01:02:20.490
tobacco plants because tobacco plants
 

01:02:20.490 --> 01:02:23.510
tobacco plants because tobacco plants
you can easily put genes into and there

01:02:23.510 --> 01:02:23.520
you can easily put genes into and there
 

01:02:23.520 --> 01:02:26.120
you can easily put genes into and there
so they're genetically manipulative

01:02:26.120 --> 01:02:26.130
so they're genetically manipulative
 

01:02:26.130 --> 01:02:28.700
so they're genetically manipulative
tobacco plants makes twenty thousand

01:02:28.700 --> 01:02:28.710
tobacco plants makes twenty thousand
 

01:02:28.710 --> 01:02:31.280
tobacco plants makes twenty thousand
doses of X at under twenty cents a dose

01:02:31.280 --> 01:02:31.290
doses of X at under twenty cents a dose
 

01:02:31.290 --> 01:02:34.339
doses of X at under twenty cents a dose
so this is significantly cheaper and my

01:02:34.339 --> 01:02:34.349
so this is significantly cheaper and my
 

01:02:34.349 --> 01:02:36.140
so this is significantly cheaper and my
colleague Dixon de palma is a big

01:02:36.140 --> 01:02:36.150
colleague Dixon de palma is a big
 

01:02:36.150 --> 01:02:38.780
colleague Dixon de palma is a big
proponent of making vertical farms and

01:02:38.780 --> 01:02:38.790
proponent of making vertical farms and
 

01:02:38.790 --> 01:02:40.880
proponent of making vertical farms and
cities growing your crops hydroponically

01:02:40.880 --> 01:02:40.890
cities growing your crops hydroponically
 

01:02:40.890 --> 01:02:42.980
cities growing your crops hydroponically
so we thought that this would be this is

01:02:42.980 --> 01:02:42.990
so we thought that this would be this is
 

01:02:42.990 --> 01:02:45.260
so we thought that this would be this is
Dixon here you'll meet him later in the

01:02:45.260 --> 01:02:45.270
Dixon here you'll meet him later in the
 

01:02:45.270 --> 01:02:47.839
Dixon here you'll meet him later in the
course and we think we should that he

01:02:47.839 --> 01:02:47.849
course and we think we should that he
 

01:02:47.849 --> 01:02:50.720
course and we think we should that he
should make these flu vaccines in his

01:02:50.720 --> 01:02:50.730
should make these flu vaccines in his
 

01:02:50.730 --> 01:02:53.329
should make these flu vaccines in his
vertical farms and it would be even

01:02:53.329 --> 01:02:53.339
vertical farms and it would be even
 

01:02:53.339 --> 01:02:55.550
vertical farms and it would be even
cheaper so here's an example of why it

01:02:55.550 --> 01:02:55.560
cheaper so here's an example of why it
 

01:02:55.560 --> 01:02:58.309
cheaper so here's an example of why it
would be really good to make this

01:02:58.309 --> 01:02:58.319
would be really good to make this
 

01:02:58.319 --> 01:02:59.599
would be really good to make this
vaccine in plan

01:02:59.599 --> 01:02:59.609
vaccine in plan
 

01:02:59.609 --> 01:03:03.109
vaccine in plan
so let's say you have a new pandemic

01:03:03.109 --> 01:03:03.119
so let's say you have a new pandemic
 

01:03:03.119 --> 01:03:05.449
so let's say you have a new pandemic
strain of influenza virus right here so

01:03:05.449 --> 01:03:05.459
strain of influenza virus right here so
 

01:03:05.459 --> 01:03:07.880
strain of influenza virus right here so
night in 2009 we had a new strain emerge

01:03:07.880 --> 01:03:07.890
night in 2009 we had a new strain emerge
 

01:03:07.890 --> 01:03:09.259
night in 2009 we had a new strain emerge
all right

01:03:09.259 --> 01:03:09.269
all right
 

01:03:09.269 --> 01:03:13.400
all right
so then you start making your egg-based

01:03:13.400 --> 01:03:13.410
so then you start making your egg-based
 

01:03:13.410 --> 01:03:15.799
so then you start making your egg-based
vaccine and it takes you about six

01:03:15.799 --> 01:03:15.809
vaccine and it takes you about six
 

01:03:15.809 --> 01:03:18.259
vaccine and it takes you about six
months to start putting egg-based

01:03:18.259 --> 01:03:18.269
months to start putting egg-based
 

01:03:18.269 --> 01:03:21.019
months to start putting egg-based
vaccine into the market you have to make

01:03:21.019 --> 01:03:21.029
vaccine into the market you have to make
 

01:03:21.029 --> 01:03:23.719
vaccine into the market you have to make
a reassortant with a high yielding egg

01:03:23.719 --> 01:03:23.729
a reassortant with a high yielding egg
 

01:03:23.729 --> 01:03:25.519
a reassortant with a high yielding egg
vaccine you have to produce it in eggs

01:03:25.519 --> 01:03:25.529
vaccine you have to produce it in eggs
 

01:03:25.529 --> 01:03:27.769
vaccine you have to produce it in eggs
and inactivate it you have to test it a

01:03:27.769 --> 01:03:27.779
and inactivate it you have to test it a
 

01:03:27.779 --> 01:03:32.089
and inactivate it you have to test it a
bit so you're six months in by then the

01:03:32.089 --> 01:03:32.099
bit so you're six months in by then the
 

01:03:32.099 --> 01:03:34.099
bit so you're six months in by then the
pandemic first wave is already beginning

01:03:34.099 --> 01:03:34.109
pandemic first wave is already beginning
 

01:03:34.109 --> 01:03:37.519
pandemic first wave is already beginning
here's the peak of disease and you've

01:03:37.519 --> 01:03:37.529
here's the peak of disease and you've
 

01:03:37.529 --> 01:03:39.769
here's the peak of disease and you've
missed it by the time you get your eggs

01:03:39.769 --> 01:03:39.779
missed it by the time you get your eggs
 

01:03:39.779 --> 01:03:42.769
missed it by the time you get your eggs
vaccine into the population and in fact

01:03:42.769 --> 01:03:42.779
vaccine into the population and in fact
 

01:03:42.779 --> 01:03:45.859
vaccine into the population and in fact
it turns out that for 2009 all the

01:03:45.859 --> 01:03:45.869
it turns out that for 2009 all the
 

01:03:45.869 --> 01:03:47.959
it turns out that for 2009 all the
vaccines that we released were really

01:03:47.959 --> 01:03:47.969
vaccines that we released were really
 

01:03:47.969 --> 01:03:51.170
vaccines that we released were really
too late to make an impact on h1n1

01:03:51.170 --> 01:03:51.180
too late to make an impact on h1n1
 

01:03:51.180 --> 01:03:53.239
too late to make an impact on h1n1
disease on the other hand if you make it

01:03:53.239 --> 01:03:53.249
disease on the other hand if you make it
 

01:03:53.249 --> 01:03:55.819
disease on the other hand if you make it
in plants you can immediately get the

01:03:55.819 --> 01:03:55.829
in plants you can immediately get the
 

01:03:55.829 --> 01:03:57.529
in plants you can immediately get the
sequence of the H a from your first

01:03:57.529 --> 01:03:57.539
sequence of the H a from your first
 

01:03:57.539 --> 01:04:00.079
sequence of the H a from your first
isolate and you can within three months

01:04:00.079 --> 01:04:00.089
isolate and you can within three months
 

01:04:00.089 --> 01:04:02.509
isolate and you can within three months
have a plant-based vaccine supply

01:04:02.509 --> 01:04:02.519
have a plant-based vaccine supply
 

01:04:02.519 --> 01:04:04.400
have a plant-based vaccine supply
because all you have to do is express it

01:04:04.400 --> 01:04:04.410
because all you have to do is express it
 

01:04:04.410 --> 01:04:06.859
because all you have to do is express it
in plants it's very easy to purify from

01:04:06.859 --> 01:04:06.869
in plants it's very easy to purify from
 

01:04:06.869 --> 01:04:09.259
in plants it's very easy to purify from
the particles from the plant fluids and

01:04:09.259 --> 01:04:09.269
the particles from the plant fluids and
 

01:04:09.269 --> 01:04:10.609
the particles from the plant fluids and
you could have an egg-based vaccines so

01:04:10.609 --> 01:04:10.619
you could have an egg-based vaccines so
 

01:04:10.619 --> 01:04:12.109
you could have an egg-based vaccines so
these are now in clinical trials and

01:04:12.109 --> 01:04:12.119
these are now in clinical trials and
 

01:04:12.119 --> 01:04:13.999
these are now in clinical trials and
people there a number of publications

01:04:13.999 --> 01:04:14.009
people there a number of publications
 

01:04:14.009 --> 01:04:16.130
people there a number of publications
already describing their immunogenicity

01:04:16.130 --> 01:04:16.140
already describing their immunogenicity
 

01:04:16.140 --> 01:04:23.630
already describing their immunogenicity
yeah I'm sure there will be that's why

01:04:23.630 --> 01:04:23.640
yeah I'm sure there will be that's why
 

01:04:23.640 --> 01:04:25.370
yeah I'm sure there will be that's why
they have to put it in many many people

01:04:25.370 --> 01:04:25.380
they have to put it in many many people
 

01:04:25.380 --> 01:04:27.109
they have to put it in many many people
before it will be licensed but in the

01:04:27.109 --> 01:04:27.119
before it will be licensed but in the
 

01:04:27.119 --> 01:04:29.779
before it will be licensed but in the
early phase one safety tests they're

01:04:29.779 --> 01:04:29.789
early phase one safety tests they're
 

01:04:29.789 --> 01:04:32.449
early phase one safety tests they're
they're nothing so far but we'll see

01:04:32.449 --> 01:04:32.459
they're nothing so far but we'll see
 

01:04:32.459 --> 01:04:35.420
they're nothing so far but we'll see
because it is an extract of tobacco

01:04:35.420 --> 01:04:35.430
because it is an extract of tobacco
 

01:04:35.430 --> 01:04:37.279
because it is an extract of tobacco
plant so you can imagine that there

01:04:37.279 --> 01:04:37.289
plant so you can imagine that there
 

01:04:37.289 --> 01:04:42.140
plant so you can imagine that there
might be something in it so all of the

01:04:42.140 --> 01:04:42.150
might be something in it so all of the
 

01:04:42.150 --> 01:04:43.849
might be something in it so all of the
vaccinations we've talked about leads to

01:04:43.849 --> 01:04:43.859
vaccinations we've talked about leads to
 

01:04:43.859 --> 01:04:45.620
vaccinations we've talked about leads to
one question can you have a decayed

01:04:45.620 --> 01:04:45.630
one question can you have a decayed
 

01:04:45.630 --> 01:04:48.699
one question can you have a decayed
viral diseases and as we said earlier

01:04:48.699 --> 01:04:48.709
viral diseases and as we said earlier
 

01:04:48.709 --> 01:04:52.999
viral diseases and as we said earlier
smallpox was eradicated in 1978 there's

01:04:52.999 --> 01:04:53.009
smallpox was eradicated in 1978 there's
 

01:04:53.009 --> 01:04:54.650
smallpox was eradicated in 1978 there's
no more smallpox it's the only major

01:04:54.650 --> 01:04:54.660
no more smallpox it's the only major
 

01:04:54.660 --> 01:04:57.469
no more smallpox it's the only major
human disease to be eradicated and what

01:04:57.469 --> 01:04:57.479
human disease to be eradicated and what
 

01:04:57.479 --> 01:04:59.509
human disease to be eradicated and what
do you need to eradicate a virus

01:04:59.509 --> 01:04:59.519
do you need to eradicate a virus
 

01:04:59.519 --> 01:05:02.239
do you need to eradicate a virus
infection well two main features one you

01:05:02.239 --> 01:05:02.249
infection well two main features one you
 

01:05:02.249 --> 01:05:04.609
infection well two main features one you
should have just one host that the virus

01:05:04.609 --> 01:05:04.619
should have just one host that the virus
 

01:05:04.619 --> 01:05:06.529
should have just one host that the virus
replicates in so small pox only

01:05:06.529 --> 01:05:06.539
replicates in so small pox only
 

01:05:06.539 --> 01:05:09.109
replicates in so small pox only
replicates in people polio only

01:05:09.109 --> 01:05:09.119
replicates in people polio only
 

01:05:09.119 --> 01:05:11.150
replicates in people polio only
replicates in people if it replicates in

01:05:11.150 --> 01:05:11.160
replicates in people if it replicates in
 

01:05:11.160 --> 01:05:12.529
replicates in people if it replicates in
animals then it's a very

01:05:12.529 --> 01:05:12.539
animals then it's a very
 

01:05:12.539 --> 01:05:14.630
animals then it's a very
difficult to eradicate it because even

01:05:14.630 --> 01:05:14.640
difficult to eradicate it because even
 

01:05:14.640 --> 01:05:16.370
difficult to eradicate it because even
if you get rid of the virus and people

01:05:16.370 --> 01:05:16.380
if you get rid of the virus and people
 

01:05:16.380 --> 01:05:18.769
if you get rid of the virus and people
that's still in the animals and you have

01:05:18.769 --> 01:05:18.779
that's still in the animals and you have
 

01:05:18.779 --> 01:05:20.779
that's still in the animals and you have
to induce lifelong immunity to

01:05:20.779 --> 01:05:20.789
to induce lifelong immunity to
 

01:05:20.789 --> 01:05:22.339
to induce lifelong immunity to
vaccinations so if you have these two

01:05:22.339 --> 01:05:22.349
vaccinations so if you have these two
 

01:05:22.349 --> 01:05:25.159
vaccinations so if you have these two
you can possibly eradicate so measles is

01:05:25.159 --> 01:05:25.169
you can possibly eradicate so measles is
 

01:05:25.169 --> 01:05:27.559
you can possibly eradicate so measles is
another candidate for eradication it

01:05:27.559 --> 01:05:27.569
another candidate for eradication it
 

01:05:27.569 --> 01:05:29.349
another candidate for eradication it
just replicates in people and

01:05:29.349 --> 01:05:29.359
just replicates in people and
 

01:05:29.359 --> 01:05:32.569
just replicates in people and
vaccination induces lifelong immunity

01:05:32.569 --> 01:05:32.579
vaccination induces lifelong immunity
 

01:05:32.579 --> 01:05:35.539
vaccination induces lifelong immunity
now this is a very interesting situation

01:05:35.539 --> 01:05:35.549
now this is a very interesting situation
 

01:05:35.549 --> 01:05:38.239
now this is a very interesting situation
we're in with smallpox since it's been

01:05:38.239 --> 01:05:38.249
we're in with smallpox since it's been
 

01:05:38.249 --> 01:05:40.699
we're in with smallpox since it's been
eradicated and there's almost no pox

01:05:40.699 --> 01:05:40.709
eradicated and there's almost no pox
 

01:05:40.709 --> 01:05:42.739
eradicated and there's almost no pox
there are just two more stocks of Vire

01:05:42.739 --> 01:05:42.749
there are just two more stocks of Vire
 

01:05:42.749 --> 01:05:44.599
there are just two more stocks of Vire
there are two stocks of virus left in

01:05:44.599 --> 01:05:44.609
there are two stocks of virus left in
 

01:05:44.609 --> 01:05:47.390
there are two stocks of virus left in
the world one in CDC in Atlanta and one

01:05:47.390 --> 01:05:47.400
the world one in CDC in Atlanta and one
 

01:05:47.400 --> 01:05:51.859
the world one in CDC in Atlanta and one
in Russia and so w-h-o has said for

01:05:51.859 --> 01:05:51.869
in Russia and so w-h-o has said for
 

01:05:51.869 --> 01:05:54.109
in Russia and so w-h-o has said for
years we should destroy all these virus

01:05:54.109 --> 01:05:54.119
years we should destroy all these virus
 

01:05:54.119 --> 01:05:56.209
years we should destroy all these virus
stocks because maybe the terrorists

01:05:56.209 --> 01:05:56.219
stocks because maybe the terrorists
 

01:05:56.219 --> 01:05:58.219
stocks because maybe the terrorists
would get a hold of them and use them

01:05:58.219 --> 01:05:58.229
would get a hold of them and use them
 

01:05:58.229 --> 01:05:59.870
would get a hold of them and use them
for nefarious purposes we don't get

01:05:59.870 --> 01:05:59.880
for nefarious purposes we don't get
 

01:05:59.880 --> 01:06:01.909
for nefarious purposes we don't get
immunized against smallpox anymore

01:06:01.909 --> 01:06:01.919
immunized against smallpox anymore
 

01:06:01.919 --> 01:06:03.589
immunized against smallpox anymore
because there's no disease but we're all

01:06:03.589 --> 01:06:03.599
because there's no disease but we're all
 

01:06:03.599 --> 01:06:06.109
because there's no disease but we're all
susceptible so it would be a good the

01:06:06.109 --> 01:06:06.119
susceptible so it would be a good the
 

01:06:06.119 --> 01:06:08.479
susceptible so it would be a good the
argument is that it would be a bioterror

01:06:08.479 --> 01:06:08.489
argument is that it would be a bioterror
 

01:06:08.489 --> 01:06:10.400
argument is that it would be a bioterror
weapon and they should be destroyed

01:06:10.400 --> 01:06:10.410
weapon and they should be destroyed
 

01:06:10.410 --> 01:06:12.650
weapon and they should be destroyed
whether or not is going to happen or not

01:06:12.650 --> 01:06:12.660
whether or not is going to happen or not
 

01:06:12.660 --> 01:06:15.019
whether or not is going to happen or not
I don't know it's been debated for 10

01:06:15.029 --> 01:06:18.469
I don't know it's been debated for 10
years and it's not clear what will

01:06:18.469 --> 01:06:18.479
years and it's not clear what will
 

01:06:18.479 --> 01:06:21.409

Western Hemisphere polio was eradicated
a number of years ago so immunization

01:08:58.920 --> 01:08:58.930
a number of years ago so immunization

have to immunize so then you have

01:09:05.519 --> 01:09:05.529
have to immunize so then you have
 

01:09:05.529 --> 01:09:07.800
have to immunize so then you have
pockets of susceptible individuals in

pockets of susceptible individuals in
 

01:09:07.810 --> 01:09:09.660
pockets of susceptible individuals in
various places and then a vaccine

01:09:09.660 --> 01:09:09.670
various places and then a vaccine
 

01:09:09.670 --> 01:09:11.370

causes
 

01:09:12.460 --> 01:09:15.180
causes
disease and so these are strains of

and they can't clear it they shed it for
10-15 years or longer and they're fine

01:09:31.829 --> 01:09:31.839
10-15 years or longer and they're fine
 

01:09:31.839 --> 01:09:33.450
10-15 years or longer and they're fine
they're not sick at all so you don't

01:09:33.450 --> 01:09:33.460
they're not sick at all so you don't
 

01:09:33.460 --> 01:09:35.070
they're not sick at all so you don't
even know where they are and the number

01:09:35.070 --> 01:09:35.080
even know where they are and the number
 

01:09:35.080 --> 01:09:36.180
even know where they are and the number
of these individuals have been

01:09:36.180 --> 01:09:36.190
of these individuals have been
 

01:09:36.190 --> 01:09:38.249
of these individuals have been
responsible for sparking these outbreaks

01:09:38.249 --> 01:09:38.259
responsible for sparking these outbreaks
 

01:09:38.259 --> 01:09:41.720
responsible for sparking these outbreaks
of polio in these countries so basically

01:09:41.720 --> 01:09:41.730
of polio in these countries so basically
 

01:09:41.730 --> 01:09:44.849
of polio in these countries so basically
if you stopped immunizing one day you

01:09:44.849 --> 01:09:44.859
if you stopped immunizing one day you
 

01:09:44.859 --> 01:09:46.740
if you stopped immunizing one day you
would have a similar situation you would

01:09:46.740 --> 01:09:46.750
would have a similar situation you would
 

01:09:46.750 --> 01:09:49.620
would have a similar situation you would
have an increasing number of non immune

01:09:49.620 --> 01:09:49.630
have an increasing number of non immune
 

01:09:49.630 --> 01:09:52.110
have an increasing number of non immune
individuals and then the vaccine derived

01:09:52.110 --> 01:09:52.120
individuals and then the vaccine derived
 

01:09:52.120 --> 01:09:54.600
individuals and then the vaccine derived
viruses would eventually cause an

01:09:54.600 --> 01:09:54.610
viruses would eventually cause an
 

01:09:54.610 --> 01:09:58.229
viruses would eventually cause an
outbreak so you can't stop immunizing in

01:09:58.229 --> 01:09:58.239
outbreak so you can't stop immunizing in
 

01:09:58.239 --> 01:09:59.820
outbreak so you can't stop immunizing in
my view what do you have to do is you

01:09:59.820 --> 01:09:59.830
my view what do you have to do is you
 

01:09:59.830 --> 01:10:02.370
my view what do you have to do is you
have to basically vaccinate against the

01:10:02.370 --> 01:10:02.380
have to basically vaccinate against the
 

01:10:02.380 --> 01:10:04.110
have to basically vaccinate against the
vaccine so this is a paradoxical

01:10:04.110 --> 01:10:04.120
vaccine so this is a paradoxical
 

01:10:04.120 --> 01:10:06.330
vaccine so this is a paradoxical
situation now we've used an infectious

01:10:06.330 --> 01:10:06.340
situation now we've used an infectious
 

01:10:06.340 --> 01:10:09.330
situation now we've used an infectious
vaccine but it can cause disease that it

01:10:09.330 --> 01:10:09.340
vaccine but it can cause disease that it
 

01:10:09.340 --> 01:10:12.420
vaccine but it can cause disease that it
was meant to eradicate so when we're

01:10:12.420 --> 01:10:12.430
was meant to eradicate so when we're
 

01:10:12.430 --> 01:10:14.700
was meant to eradicate so when we're
done eradicating the disease we have to

01:10:14.700 --> 01:10:14.710
done eradicating the disease we have to
 

01:10:14.710 --> 01:10:16.290
done eradicating the disease we have to
then immunize with something else to get

01:10:16.290 --> 01:10:16.300
then immunize with something else to get
 

01:10:16.300 --> 01:10:18.720
then immunize with something else to get
rid of the vaccine so my view is to

01:10:18.720 --> 01:10:18.730
rid of the vaccine so my view is to
 

01:10:18.730 --> 01:10:20.490
rid of the vaccine so my view is to
start immunizing with the inactivated

01:10:20.490 --> 01:10:20.500
start immunizing with the inactivated
 

01:10:20.500 --> 01:10:23.490
start immunizing with the inactivated
vaccine and that's a problem because it

01:10:23.490 --> 01:10:23.500
vaccine and that's a problem because it
 

01:10:23.500 --> 01:10:25.020
vaccine and that's a problem because it
costs more and we don't know if it works

01:10:25.020 --> 01:10:25.030
costs more and we don't know if it works
 

01:10:25.030 --> 01:10:26.880
costs more and we don't know if it works
everywhere but then monitor the

01:10:26.880 --> 01:10:26.890
everywhere but then monitor the
 

01:10:26.890 --> 01:10:28.830
everywhere but then monitor the
environment and make sure the vaccine

01:10:28.830 --> 01:10:28.840
environment and make sure the vaccine
 

01:10:28.840 --> 01:10:31.590
environment and make sure the vaccine
derived polio viruses are gone before

01:10:31.590 --> 01:10:31.600
derived polio viruses are gone before
 

01:10:31.600 --> 01:10:34.650
derived polio viruses are gone before
you stop immunizing one day it's a

01:10:34.650 --> 01:10:34.660
you stop immunizing one day it's a
 

01:10:34.660 --> 01:10:36.690
you stop immunizing one day it's a
really interesting question because IPV

01:10:36.690 --> 01:10:36.700
really interesting question because IPV
 

01:10:36.700 --> 01:10:38.790
really interesting question because IPV
being expensive will probably just be

01:10:38.790 --> 01:10:38.800
being expensive will probably just be
 

01:10:38.800 --> 01:10:42.120
being expensive will probably just be
used in developed countries whereas the

01:10:42.120 --> 01:10:42.130
used in developed countries whereas the
 

01:10:42.130 --> 01:10:43.680
used in developed countries whereas the
underdeveloped nations which are

01:10:43.680 --> 01:10:43.690
underdeveloped nations which are
 

01:10:43.690 --> 01:10:46.380
underdeveloped nations which are
depending on w-h-o to buy them vaccine

01:10:46.380 --> 01:10:46.390
depending on w-h-o to buy them vaccine
 

01:10:46.390 --> 01:10:48.660
depending on w-h-o to buy them vaccine
as soon as no more OPV is available they

01:10:48.660 --> 01:10:48.670
as soon as no more OPV is available they
 

01:10:48.670 --> 01:10:50.970
as soon as no more OPV is available they
probably won't to immunize at all so I

01:10:50.970 --> 01:10:50.980
probably won't to immunize at all so I
 

01:10:50.980 --> 01:10:52.380
probably won't to immunize at all so I
suspect then under those conditions

01:10:52.380 --> 01:10:52.390
suspect then under those conditions
 

01:10:52.390 --> 01:10:55.040
suspect then under those conditions
there will be outbreaks again one day

01:10:55.040 --> 01:10:55.050
there will be outbreaks again one day
 

01:10:55.050 --> 01:10:57.209
there will be outbreaks again one day
for that reason we have to stockpile

01:10:57.209 --> 01:10:57.219
for that reason we have to stockpile
 

01:10:57.219 --> 01:10:59.820
for that reason we have to stockpile
polio there's still lots of polio and

01:10:59.820 --> 01:10:59.830
polio there's still lots of polio and
 

01:10:59.830 --> 01:11:02.070
polio there's still lots of polio and
research labs like my own there are

01:11:02.070 --> 01:11:02.080
research labs like my own there are
 

01:11:02.080 --> 01:11:04.050
research labs like my own there are
stored samples that have polio in them

01:11:04.050 --> 01:11:04.060
stored samples that have polio in them
 

01:11:04.060 --> 01:11:06.690
stored samples that have polio in them
but we don't know it and you can easily

01:11:06.690 --> 01:11:06.700
but we don't know it and you can easily
 

01:11:06.700 --> 01:11:08.880
but we don't know it and you can easily
make polio from the sequence it's only

01:11:08.880 --> 01:11:08.890
make polio from the sequence it's only
 

01:11:08.890 --> 01:11:10.740
make polio from the sequence it's only
seven thousand four hundred and forty

01:11:10.740 --> 01:11:10.750
seven thousand four hundred and forty
 

01:11:10.750 --> 01:11:12.330
seven thousand four hundred and forty
two bases in length and that's pretty

01:11:12.330 --> 01:11:12.340
two bases in length and that's pretty
 

01:11:12.340 --> 01:11:14.940
two bases in length and that's pretty
easy to have synthesize and make virus

01:11:14.940 --> 01:11:14.950
easy to have synthesize and make virus
 

01:11:14.950 --> 01:11:17.640
easy to have synthesize and make virus
from so you assume that you'll never be

01:11:17.640 --> 01:11:17.650
from so you assume that you'll never be
 

01:11:17.650 --> 01:11:19.260
from so you assume that you'll never be
able to get rid of all the sources of

01:11:19.260 --> 01:11:19.270
able to get rid of all the sources of
 

01:11:19.270 --> 01:11:22.740
able to get rid of all the sources of
polio so you have to stockpile some

01:11:22.740 --> 01:11:22.750
polio so you have to stockpile some
 

01:11:22.750 --> 01:11:26.400
polio so you have to stockpile some
vaccine and even if you are a

01:11:26.400 --> 01:11:26.410
vaccine and even if you are a
 

01:11:26.410 --> 01:11:29.910
vaccine and even if you are a
to eradicate polio one day as long as

01:11:29.910 --> 01:11:29.920
to eradicate polio one day as long as
 

01:11:29.920 --> 01:11:31.320
to eradicate polio one day as long as
you have the sequence you can make it

01:11:31.320 --> 01:11:31.330
you have the sequence you can make it
 

01:11:31.330 --> 01:11:33.390
you have the sequence you can make it
and you could do this for any virus of

01:11:33.390 --> 01:11:33.400
and you could do this for any virus of
 

01:11:33.400 --> 01:11:35.640
and you could do this for any virus of
course polio is easy because it's short

01:11:35.640 --> 01:11:35.650
course polio is easy because it's short
 

01:11:35.650 --> 01:11:38.940
course polio is easy because it's short
but even smallpox with a several hundred

01:11:38.940 --> 01:11:38.950
but even smallpox with a several hundred
 

01:11:38.950 --> 01:11:40.560
but even smallpox with a several hundred
thousand base pairs genome you could do

01:11:40.560 --> 01:11:40.570
thousand base pairs genome you could do
 

01:11:40.570 --> 01:11:43.830
thousand base pairs genome you could do
it as well so eradication is a concept

01:11:43.830 --> 01:11:43.840
it as well so eradication is a concept
 

01:11:43.840 --> 01:11:45.450
it as well so eradication is a concept
but in practice it really doesn't ever

01:11:45.450 --> 01:11:45.460
but in practice it really doesn't ever
 

01:11:45.460 --> 01:11:53.980
but in practice it really doesn't ever
happen

01:11:53.980 --> 01:11:53.990
