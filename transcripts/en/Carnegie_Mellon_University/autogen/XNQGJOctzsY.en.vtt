well what about wind wind it turns out

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:30.200
well what about wind wind it turns out
 

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:32.530
well what about wind wind it turns out
on small time skills is even more

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:32.540
on small time skills is even more

anywhere in the United States of America
 

00:02:44.989 --> 00:02:47.020
anywhere in the United States of America
and as you can see it was up and down

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:47.030
and as you can see it was up and down
 

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:50.650
and as you can see it was up and down
and up and down on all timescales so we

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:50.660
and up and down on all timescales so we
 

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:53.140
and up and down on all timescales so we
started examining the mathematical

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:53.150
started examining the mathematical
 

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:56.050
started examining the mathematical
character of that it's not white noise

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:56.060
character of that it's not white noise
 

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:58.960
character of that it's not white noise
it's not the same amount of power at all

00:02:58.960 --> 00:02:58.970
it's not the same amount of power at all
 

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:01.930
it's not the same amount of power at all
frequencies it turns out that's really

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:01.940
frequencies it turns out that's really
 

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:04.570
frequencies it turns out that's really
good because if it was white noise we

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:04.580
good because if it was white noise we
 

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:07.030
good because if it was white noise we
needed as many fast ramping sources

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:07.040
needed as many fast ramping sources
 

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:10.150
needed as many fast ramping sources
really expensive ones as we do slow

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:10.160
really expensive ones as we do slow
 

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:13.300
really expensive ones as we do slow
ramping sources to buffer the wind power

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:13.310
ramping sources to buffer the wind power
 

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:16.210
ramping sources to buffer the wind power
because of what we found we now know

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:16.220
because of what we found we now know
 

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:18.430
because of what we found we now know
that we can integrate wind power into

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:18.440
that we can integrate wind power into
 

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:22.030
that we can integrate wind power into
the system by using slow ramping fossil

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:22.040

fuel plants as well as really

00:03:24.099 --> 00:03:24.109
fuel plants as well as really
 

00:03:24.109 --> 00:03:26.349
fuel plants as well as really
ultra-modern things like superconducting

00:03:26.349 --> 00:03:26.359
ultra-modern things like superconducting
 

00:03:26.359 --> 00:03:28.150
ultra-modern things like superconducting
magnetic energy storage we just don't

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:28.160
magnetic energy storage we just don't
 

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:29.830
magnetic energy storage we just don't
need so much of that that's a really

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:29.840
need so much of that that's a really
 

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:32.590
need so much of that that's a really
good thing so we asked some different

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:32.600
good thing so we asked some different
 

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:35.710
good thing so we asked some different
questions about when we asked over the

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:35.720
questions about when we asked over the
 

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:39.550
questions about when we asked over the
time of a few years do we have droughts

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:39.560
time of a few years do we have droughts
 

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:41.890
time of a few years do we have droughts
in the wind like we have droughts in the

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:41.900
in the wind like we have droughts in the
 

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:44.349
in the wind like we have droughts in the
water power and the answer when we

00:03:44.349 --> 00:03:44.359
water power and the answer when we
 

00:03:44.359 --> 00:03:46.390
water power and the answer when we
looked at it is yes there's gonna be

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:46.400
looked at it is yes there's gonna be
 

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:48.940
looked at it is yes there's gonna be
windy years and not so windy years so we

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:48.950
windy years and not so windy years so we
 

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:50.500
windy years and not so windy years so we
have to take that into account just like

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:50.510
have to take that into account just like
 

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:52.930
have to take that into account just like
we do for a hydroelectric power and then

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:52.940
we do for a hydroelectric power and then
 

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:54.340
we do for a hydroelectric power and then
we said well you know you put a lot of

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:54.350
we said well you know you put a lot of
 

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:56.229
we said well you know you put a lot of
wind in and you put a lot of reliance on

00:03:56.229 --> 00:03:56.239
wind in and you put a lot of reliance on
 

00:03:56.239 --> 00:04:00.250
wind in and you put a lot of reliance on
