I showed you this example

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:06.000
to illustrate how ambiguous statistics really is.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
In choosing how to graph your data,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000
you can majorly impact what people believe to be the case.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
In fact, a famous saying goes,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
"I never believe in statistics I didn't doctor myself."

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
I'll let you guess here who this is being attributed to--

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000
Mark Twain, Oscar Wilde, or Winston Churchill.

00:00:27.000 --> 99:59:59.000
Check the Web, and see who invented this famous quote.
