00:00:08.598 --> 00:00:11.429
One foggy morning in 1884,

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:16.697
the British steamer "Rumney" crashed
into the French ship "Frigorifique."

00:00:16.697 --> 00:00:18.479
Seeing their ship filling with water,

00:00:18.479 --> 00:00:21.789
the French crew climbed 
aboard the "Rumney."

00:00:21.789 --> 00:00:23.999
But as they sailed towards 
the nearest port,

00:00:23.999 --> 00:00:27.887
a silent form suddenly emerged
from the fog:

00:00:27.887 --> 00:00:30.628
the abandoned "Frigorifique."

00:00:30.628 --> 00:00:32.089
It was too late to turn,

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:35.328
and the impact was enough 
to sink the "Rumney."

00:00:35.328 --> 00:00:37.629
As the sailors scrambled 
into the lifeboats,

00:00:37.629 --> 00:00:40.869
the empty "Frigorifique"
sailed back into the fog,

00:00:40.869 --> 00:00:43.658
having seemingly taken its revenge.

00:00:43.658 --> 00:00:47.369
In reality, the French sailors had left
the engines running,

00:00:47.369 --> 00:00:50.930
and the "Frigorifique" sailed in a circle
before striking the "Rumney"

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:53.740
and finally sinking.

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:56.919
But its story became one of the many tales
of ghost ships,

00:00:56.919 --> 00:01:01.430
unmanned vessels that apparently
sail themselves.

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:03.851
And although they've influenced
works like "Dracula"

00:01:03.851 --> 00:01:05.579
and "Pirates of the Caribbean,"

00:01:05.579 --> 00:01:09.440
crewless ships aren't the product
of ghostly spirits,

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:11.551
just physics at work.

00:01:11.551 --> 00:01:15.120
One of the most famous ghost ships
was the "Mary Celeste"

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:20.191
found sailing the Atlantic in 1872
with no one aboard,

00:01:20.191 --> 00:01:21.631
water in its hold,

00:01:21.631 --> 00:01:24.451
and lifeboats missing.

00:01:24.451 --> 00:01:29.550
The discovery of its intact cargo
and a captain's log that ended abruptly

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:32.532
led to wild rumors and speculation.

00:01:32.532 --> 00:01:36.231
But the real culprits 
were two scientific phenomena:

00:01:36.231 --> 00:01:37.131
buoyancy

00:01:37.131 --> 00:01:39.062
and fluid dynamics.

00:01:39.062 --> 00:01:41.481
Here's how buoyancy works.

00:01:41.481 --> 00:01:46.390
An object placed in a liquid displaces
a certain volume of fluid.

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:50.251
The liquid in turn exerts
an upward buoyant force

00:01:50.251 --> 00:01:53.781
equal to the weight of the fluid
that's been displaced.

00:01:53.781 --> 00:01:56.404
This phenomenon is called
Archimedes's Principle.

00:01:56.404 --> 00:01:58.488
Objects that are less dense than water,

00:01:58.488 --> 00:01:59.709
such as balsa wood,

00:01:59.709 --> 00:02:00.755
icebergs,

00:02:00.755 --> 00:02:02.361
and inflatable rafts

00:02:02.361 --> 00:02:03.715
always float.

00:02:03.715 --> 00:02:05.642
That's because the upward buoyant force

00:02:05.642 --> 00:02:09.994
is always stronger than 
the downward force of gravity.

00:02:09.994 --> 00:02:13.899
But for objects or ships to float when 
they're made of materials, like steel,

00:02:13.899 --> 00:02:15.482
that are denser than water,

00:02:15.482 --> 00:02:19.722
they must displace a volume of water
larger than their weight.

00:02:19.722 --> 00:02:23.873
Normally, the water filling a ship's hull
would increase its weight

00:02:23.873 --> 00:02:25.382
and cause it to sink -

00:02:25.382 --> 00:02:29.502
just what the "Mary Celeste's" crew feared
when they abandoned ship.

00:02:29.502 --> 00:02:32.795
But the sailors didn't account 
for fluid dynamics.

00:02:32.795 --> 00:02:36.095
The water stopped flowing at the point
of equilibrium,

00:02:36.095 --> 00:02:38.992
when it reached 
the same level as the hull.

00:02:38.992 --> 00:02:43.462
As it turned out, the weight of the water
wasn't enough to sink the ship

00:02:43.462 --> 00:02:46.204
and the "Mary Celeste"
was found a few days later

00:02:46.204 --> 00:02:50.843
while the unfortunate crew 
never made it to shore.

00:02:50.843 --> 00:02:54.363
Far stranger is the tale 
of "A. Ernest Mills,"

00:02:54.363 --> 00:02:56.443
a schooner transporting salt,

00:02:56.443 --> 00:03:00.643
whose crew watched it sink to 
the sea floor following a collision.

00:03:00.643 --> 00:03:05.133
Yet four days later,
it was spotted floating on the surface.

00:03:05.133 --> 00:03:10.013
The key to the mystery lay in the ship's
heavy cargo of salt.

00:03:10.013 --> 00:03:13.733
The added weight of the water in the hull
made the vessel sink,

00:03:13.733 --> 00:03:16.033
but as the salt dissolved in the water,

00:03:16.033 --> 00:03:18.123
the weight decreased enough

00:03:18.123 --> 00:03:22.023
that the force of gravity 
became less than the buoyant force

00:03:22.023 --> 00:03:25.524
and the ship floated back to the surface.

00:03:25.524 --> 00:03:30.025
But how do we explain the most
enduring aspect of ghost ship legends:

00:03:30.025 --> 00:03:36.885
multiple sightings of the same ships 
hundreds of miles and several years apart?

00:03:36.885 --> 00:03:39.451
The answer lies in ocean currents,

00:03:39.451 --> 00:03:43.052
which are like invisible rivers flowing
through the ocean.

00:03:43.052 --> 00:03:44.291
Factors, like temperature,

00:03:44.291 --> 00:03:45.301
salinity,

00:03:45.301 --> 00:03:46.151
wind,

00:03:46.151 --> 00:03:46.962
gravity,

00:03:46.962 --> 00:03:49.901
and the Coriolis effect from
the Earth's rotation

00:03:49.901 --> 00:03:54.111
create a complex system of water movement.

00:03:54.111 --> 00:03:58.700
That applies both at the ocean's surface
and deep below.

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:01.244
Sailors have always known about currents,

00:04:01.244 --> 00:04:05.794
but their patterns weren't well known
until recently.

00:04:05.794 --> 00:04:10.277
In fact, tracking abandoned ships was how
scientists determined the shape

00:04:10.277 --> 00:04:12.918
and speed of the Atlantic Gyre,

00:04:12.918 --> 00:04:14.147
the Gulf Stream,

00:04:14.147 --> 00:04:17.088
and related currents in the first place.

00:04:17.088 --> 00:04:20.738
Beginning in 1883, 
the U.S. Hydrographic Office

00:04:20.738 --> 00:04:24.436
began collecting monthly data
that included navigation hazards,

00:04:24.436 --> 00:04:29.668
like derelict ships, whose locations
were reported by passing vessels.

00:04:29.668 --> 00:04:34.996
So abandoned ships may not be moved
by ghost crews or supernatural curses,

00:04:34.996 --> 00:04:38.207
but they are a real 
and fascinating phenomenon

00:04:38.207 --> 00:04:39.768
born through the ocean

00:04:39.768 --> 00:04:44.718
and kept afloat by powerful, invisible,
scientifically studied forces.
