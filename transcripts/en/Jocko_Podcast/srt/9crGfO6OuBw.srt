1
00:00:00,980 --> 00:00:01,620
Okay.

2
00:00:01,620 --> 00:00:02,580
This is what

3
00:00:04,260 --> 00:00:09,260
I think would be closer to what Henry
the fifth a combat leader would have

4
00:00:12,091 --> 00:00:14,700
sounded like as he,

5
00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:20,190
as he answered some one of his subordinate
leaders out there in the crowd,

6
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:22,770
seen that we need more
people. We need more men.

7
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:26,370
I think this is what he
would have sounded like.

8
00:00:29,110 --> 00:00:33,790
What's he that wishes? So
my cousin Westmoreland.

9
00:00:35,650 --> 00:00:40,210
No, my fair cousin. If
we are marked to die,

10
00:00:40,450 --> 00:00:45,450
we are enough to do our country
loss and if to live the fewer men,

11
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:50,410
the greater share of honor. God's will.

12
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:53,320
I pray thee wish. Not One more man

13
00:00:55,890 --> 00:00:56,723
by jove.

14
00:00:56,730 --> 00:01:01,730
I am not covetous for gold nor
care I who doth feed upon my cost.

15
00:01:01,950 --> 00:01:03,750
It earns me not if men,

16
00:01:03,751 --> 00:01:08,070
my garments wear such
outward things dwell,

17
00:01:08,071 --> 00:01:11,090
not my desires, but

18
00:01:12,690 --> 00:01:14,850
if it be a sin to covet honor,

19
00:01:17,750 --> 00:01:20,360
I am the most offending soul alive.

20
00:01:21,410 --> 00:01:25,370
No faith, my Coz wish,
not a man from England.

21
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:26,840
God's peace.

22
00:01:28,130 --> 00:01:31,760
I would not lose so great
an honor as one man more me,

23
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:35,960
things would share from me
for the best hope I have.

24
00:01:37,580 --> 00:01:39,200
Oh, do not wish one more.

25
00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:46,060
Rather proclaim it Westmoreland through
my host that he which hath no stomach to

26
00:01:48,411 --> 00:01:49,070
this fight.

27
00:01:49,070 --> 00:01:54,070
Let him depart his passport shall be
made and crowns for convoy shall be put

28
00:01:55,041 --> 00:01:56,180
into his purse.

29
00:01:58,220 --> 00:02:03,220
We would not die in that man's company
that fears his fellowship to die with us.

30
00:02:07,970 --> 00:02:11,330
This Day is called the feast of Crispian.

31
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:18,240
He that outlives this day and comes home
safe will stand a tiptoe when the day

32
00:02:18,730 --> 00:02:21,820
is named and rouse him
at the name of Crispian.

33
00:02:24,070 --> 00:02:29,070
He that shall see this day and live all
the age will yearly on the vigil feast

34
00:02:29,651 --> 00:02:32,710
his neighbors and say,
tomorrow is Saint Crispian.

35
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:39,900
Then will he strip his sleeve and show
his scars and say these wounds I had on

36
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:43,330
Crispin's Day

37
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:51,330
old men forget yet all shall be forgot,

38
00:02:51,810 --> 00:02:56,810
but he'll remember with advantages
what feats he did that day.

39
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:05,430
Then shall our names familiar
in his mouth as household words.

40
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:10,060
Harry, the King Bedford and
Exeter, Warwick and Talbot,

41
00:03:10,090 --> 00:03:14,170
Salisbury and Gloucester
be in their flowing cups,

42
00:03:14,171 --> 00:03:15,550
freshly remembered

43
00:03:19,610 --> 00:03:22,940
this story shall the good man teaches son

44
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:30,300
at Crispin Crispian shall ne'er go by
from this day to the ending of the world.

45
00:03:31,380 --> 00:03:36,160
But we in it shall be
remembered. We, phew.

46
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:37,280
Yeah,

47
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:40,310
we happy few. We band of brothers

48
00:03:42,770 --> 00:03:47,770
for cook for he today that sheds his
blood with me shall be my brother.

49
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:54,690
The ne'er so vile this day
shall gentle his condition

50
00:03:56,780 --> 00:04:01,700
and gentlemen in England now a bed
shall think themselves or curse it.

51
00:04:01,701 --> 00:04:05,240
They were not here and
hold their manhoods cheap.

52
00:04:05,420 --> 00:04:08,330
Whiles any speaks that fought with us

53
00:04:09,830 --> 00:04:11,750
upon Saint Crispin's Day.
