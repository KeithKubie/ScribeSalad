00:00:04.750 --> 00:00:05.250
Hi.

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:06.270
Welcome, everyone.

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:11.910
We were so thrilled to have
such a wonderful turnout

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:13.440
for this session.

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:16.740
And I just want to
welcome you all to it

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:19.429
and thank you for
the active engagement

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:20.970
that we're going to
be asking of you.

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:22.380
So don't get too
comfy in the seat

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:23.963
that you're sitting
in because there's

00:00:23.963 --> 00:00:27.360
going to be some true
breaking out happening here.

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:28.230
I'm Rebecca Nesson.

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:30.630
I work at the Extension
School and summer school,

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:33.450
and, together with Erin
Bauman from the Kennedy School

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:35.820
and my colleagues
Adrian and Karena,

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:38.280
we have planned
this session to help

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:41.970
take us from the big picture
of thinking about teaching

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:44.040
evaluation that we
had in the plenary

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.650
down to the smaller
picture of focusing

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:48.850
on a single course, perhaps
a course that you teach

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:50.910
or a course that
you've worked on,

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:52.560
and thinking about
how the teaching

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:54.330
and learning in that
particular course

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:57.300
might be improved
without overhauling

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.640
the entire syllabus,
without changing

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:03.510
the fundamental style of who
the teacher is as a teacher.

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:06.570
So we're looking at smaller
types of interventions

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.790
that can make a big
difference in the experience

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:11.650
of the teacher and the
students in the course.

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:14.490
And we started with a
couple of hypotheses

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:17.820
of the types of these
changes in courses

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:19.530
that we've seen
make big differences

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:23.340
in our experiences working in
teaching and learning centers.

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:27.600
So first, changes that help us
to create engagement to make

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.270
sure that the students minds
are focused on what's happening

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:32.220
in the classroom while
they're in the class

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:34.170
and actively engaging
with the material,

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:38.680
and, also, when they're working
on activities outside of class.

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:41.670
Secondly, building
trust within the class,

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:43.950
forming a sense of
community and relationships

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:47.570
between the instructors and
between the peers in the class

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:50.340
so that the students really
are comfortable and open enough

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:53.410
to be ready for the learning
and the learning experience

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:56.550
that we're hoping to
create in the class.

00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:59.850
And then, thirdly,
to provide students

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:02.730
with the tools they need
to actually assimilate what

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:04.740
they're learning in the
class or to help them

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:07.680
focus on the right pieces of--

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:10.139
the right concepts that
you want them to take away,

00:02:10.139 --> 00:02:13.600
and to think hard
about those things.

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:16.050
So to help us do
this we have invited

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:19.050
two distinguished faculty
members to give us

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:22.530
two brief talks about their
experiences with activities

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:25.374
that they have designed
that are along these lines

00:02:25.374 --> 00:02:26.790
and that have made
transformations

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:27.581
in their own class.

00:02:27.581 --> 00:02:30.651
So we have Emily Click, from
the Harvard Divinity School

00:02:30.651 --> 00:02:32.650
and Jonathan Haussmann,
from the Harvard Medical

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:36.210
School, who are going to share
with us their experiences.

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:40.755
After that, we are going to do
a larger activity where we all

00:02:40.755 --> 00:02:42.630
move around the room,
and you'll get a chance

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:45.480
to play with these mysterious
decks of cards that

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:47.340
are sitting in front of you.

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:50.670
But we're going to start off
with creating our own community

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:53.370
for this session with a
little icebreaker of our own.

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:55.800
So for that, I'm going
to pass it on to Aaron.

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:01.335
So for this it's kind of
going to try and channel

00:03:01.335 --> 00:03:02.710
some of the
exercises that we may

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:04.390
have done in primary school.

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:06.940
So I'd like, at your
tables, for everyone

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:09.730
to count off 1, 2, and 3.

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:12.370
So here-- skipping
Jonathan and Emily--

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:14.740
we will go 1, 2, 3.

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:15.669
And then 1.

00:03:15.669 --> 00:03:16.960
So just do that at your tables.

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:18.640
Everybody count 1, 2, 3.

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:19.880
And then we'll break out.

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:20.702
Don't worry.

00:03:20.702 --> 00:03:22.660
Now that it sounds like
everybody has a number,

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:25.060
I'd like everyone who
is a 1 to come and sit

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:29.200
at one of these three
tables, everyone who is a 2

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:34.090
to come in at one of these
three tables, and everyone's a 3

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:37.790
to come and sit at
these three tables.

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:39.290
All right, another one of my--

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:41.949
another one of my regulatory
primary school tricks.

00:03:41.949 --> 00:03:43.990
Now that everybody has
gotten to their new tables

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:45.280
and put themselves
up in new groups,

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:47.090
we're going to give you a
chance to go back and do

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:49.215
what it sounds like you
are already starting to do,

00:03:49.215 --> 00:03:51.790
and that's get to know one
another at these new groups.

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:55.330
So at your new tables, if
you want to group yourself

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:57.330
into groups of kind
of three or four--

00:03:57.330 --> 00:03:59.830
so it doesn't have to go on the
whole group, but just groups

00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:01.270
of three to four.

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:04.780
I would like you to take kind
of the next five to 10 minutes

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:07.720
and share your name,
share your role--

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:09.460
where you're from, what you do--

00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:13.630
and then share a problem or
an opportunity for improvement

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:16.420
that you have encountered
in a course you're teaching,

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:20.060
a course you're taking, or
a course you're working on.

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:23.765
So name, role, and a
problem or opportunity

00:04:23.765 --> 00:04:26.140
for improvement in a course
that you're teaching, taking,

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:27.280
or working on.

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:29.680
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:04:33.831 --> 00:04:34.330
All right.

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:36.080
So now that you've all
had a chance to get

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:37.870
to know one another
a little bit better,

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:40.390
and to kind of think about
some of the teaching challenges

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:42.170
that you're bringing
in with you,

00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:45.100
I would like to invite Emily
Click from the Harvard Divinity

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:48.340
School, up to share some of
her teaching practices with us

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:50.672
and, specifically, to talk
about her practice using

00:04:50.672 --> 00:04:51.630
the classroom contract.

00:04:55.690 --> 00:04:57.370
So it's great to be with you.

00:04:57.370 --> 00:04:59.810
I'm looking forward to
learning from all of you.

00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:01.810
And let me just
begin by asking you

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:04.840
to think for a minute
about a particular class

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:09.010
or a classroom-type
environment where you function.

00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:14.320
And if you could think of a
one-word adjective for what

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:20.310
you hope will characterize
that learning environment.

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:23.810
What would it be like,
in one adjective?

00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:24.780
So anybody got it?

00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:27.250
We've got to have extreme
extroverts answered this,

00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:29.610
but some people are like me.

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:30.540
Anybody got one?

00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:31.370
Yes.

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:32.310
Stimulating.

00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:33.270
Stimulating.

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:35.510
Aha, anything else?

00:05:35.510 --> 00:05:36.490
Nimble.

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:38.130
Nimble.

00:05:38.130 --> 00:05:38.630
Aha?

00:05:38.630 --> 00:05:40.050
Exciting.

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:42.370
Exciting.

00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:42.870
Yes.

00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:43.790
Engaged.

00:05:43.790 --> 00:05:45.020
Engaged.

00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:47.510
That's actually my word as well.

00:05:47.510 --> 00:05:48.740
So you get 1,000 points.

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:50.540
Can somebody put
that on the board?

00:05:50.540 --> 00:05:54.690
So none of us said
passive, right?

00:05:54.690 --> 00:05:56.570
It's not what we
dream of, but that

00:05:56.570 --> 00:05:58.920
often is what winds up
happening in our classroom.

00:05:58.920 --> 00:06:01.460
So I wanted to just give
you a a bit of a story,

00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:04.250
and then just some of the
nuts and bolts of what

00:06:04.250 --> 00:06:08.240
I'm doing with what she was
calling a classroom contract

00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:11.300
or the language of
public agreement.

00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:13.760
So this story that
I have to tell

00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:16.040
is not a very attractive
story about myself,

00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:21.050
which is that, about seven
years ago, as I was teaching,

00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:23.210
I began to realize
that students had

00:06:23.210 --> 00:06:26.030
their expensive laptops open.

00:06:26.030 --> 00:06:28.490
And we usually,
in the Div school,

00:06:28.490 --> 00:06:31.130
have a kind of
square of students.

00:06:31.130 --> 00:06:34.490
And the students whose
screens I could not see,

00:06:34.490 --> 00:06:37.460
someone reported to me
were posting on Facebook

00:06:37.460 --> 00:06:40.880
and were checking their
email and so forth.

00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:44.240
And boy, did I get my nose
out of joint about that.

00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:45.800
You know, it was a--

00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:48.080
well, you know, how
could they be doing that?

00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:50.240
They're not focusing,
they're not learning.

00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:52.760
Very insulted and so forth.

00:06:52.760 --> 00:06:55.970
You know, after a
while, I realized oh,

00:06:55.970 --> 00:06:57.720
that's about my ego, isn't it?

00:06:57.720 --> 00:07:00.140
I began to get a little bit
of a sense of humor about it.

00:07:00.140 --> 00:07:01.681
Where I really got
the sense of humor

00:07:01.681 --> 00:07:05.000
about it was when I was sitting
in an administrative meeting

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:06.860
where somebody was
making a presentation

00:07:06.860 --> 00:07:10.377
and I had my very expensive
Harvard-paid-for laptop open,

00:07:10.377 --> 00:07:11.960
and I looked at my
screen and realized

00:07:11.960 --> 00:07:13.970
I was checking my email.

00:07:13.970 --> 00:07:16.970
And I thought, well,
isn't that interesting?

00:07:16.970 --> 00:07:19.250
I'm getting insulted when
the students are doing that,

00:07:19.250 --> 00:07:21.420
and I'm doing exactly
the same thing.

00:07:21.420 --> 00:07:23.130
Maybe it's a
legitimate thing to do.

00:07:23.130 --> 00:07:23.900
I don't know.

00:07:23.900 --> 00:07:27.680
But if it is a problem, to
whom does the problem belong?

00:07:27.680 --> 00:07:29.210
And I realize it
doesn't actually

00:07:29.210 --> 00:07:32.180
belong to me, except for
my ego getting bruised.

00:07:32.180 --> 00:07:35.120
But apart from that, it really
belongs to the students.

00:07:35.120 --> 00:07:37.760
And following Ron
Heifetz advice,

00:07:37.760 --> 00:07:39.350
you give the problem
to the people

00:07:39.350 --> 00:07:41.720
to whom the problem belongs.

00:07:41.720 --> 00:07:44.330
So this led me into the Kegan--

00:07:44.330 --> 00:07:46.670
Robert Keegan and
Lisa Laskow Lahey

00:07:46.670 --> 00:07:50.430
stuff on creating a language
of public agreement.

00:07:50.430 --> 00:07:53.220
And so I started doing this.

00:07:53.220 --> 00:07:54.740
And let me just
tell you, if you get

00:07:54.740 --> 00:07:58.730
tempted to do it after I told
my story, when I first did it,

00:07:58.730 --> 00:08:02.030
it felt just like when
you're standing on a cliff

00:08:02.030 --> 00:08:05.310
and you're a little too
high above the water.

00:08:05.310 --> 00:08:07.280
And as you know,
the water's cold,

00:08:07.280 --> 00:08:08.870
and you're going
to jump off anyway.

00:08:08.870 --> 00:08:10.970
That's kind of how
it felt. Because it

00:08:10.970 --> 00:08:17.060
was very vulnerable to start
asking the students what kind

00:08:17.060 --> 00:08:19.740
of learning environment
they wanted to have,

00:08:19.740 --> 00:08:21.509
including the use of computers.

00:08:21.509 --> 00:08:23.300
Because, of course, I
knew the right answer

00:08:23.300 --> 00:08:25.670
was that they shouldn't
be doing things

00:08:25.670 --> 00:08:28.250
like posting on
Facebook and so forth.

00:08:28.250 --> 00:08:31.370
But instead of me
giving the answer,

00:08:31.370 --> 00:08:34.490
to have that engaged
classroom, they

00:08:34.490 --> 00:08:36.470
get to create the
learning environment that

00:08:36.470 --> 00:08:38.429
will work for them.

00:08:38.429 --> 00:08:41.240
So I started having this
thing-- and I actually

00:08:41.240 --> 00:08:43.309
did this yesterday
with my class.

00:08:43.309 --> 00:08:46.014
So it was the third
week of school.

00:08:46.014 --> 00:08:47.680
Obviously, you can't
do a shopping week,

00:08:47.680 --> 00:08:49.850
and the second week is
still all this logistics.

00:08:49.850 --> 00:08:53.820
But very early on I spent an
hour with the students saying,

00:08:53.820 --> 00:08:56.330
what do you want to
do about computer use?

00:08:56.330 --> 00:08:58.710
It does a couple of things.

00:08:58.710 --> 00:09:04.130
One is it pops a hole in the
balloon of you're pretending

00:09:04.130 --> 00:09:06.950
you're not doing that and I'm
pretending that I don't notice

00:09:06.950 --> 00:09:09.680
that you're doing that.

00:09:09.680 --> 00:09:11.840
So that we can be real
with each other, which

00:09:11.840 --> 00:09:15.170
is a part of being truly
engaged in the classroom,

00:09:15.170 --> 00:09:19.060
bringing your full real self.

00:09:19.060 --> 00:09:23.920
It also has happened that
students have helped each other

00:09:23.920 --> 00:09:26.890
to understand that
they get distracted

00:09:26.890 --> 00:09:29.020
when they're sitting
next to somebody

00:09:29.020 --> 00:09:31.150
who is doing Instagram.

00:09:31.150 --> 00:09:33.550
And it's far more
powerful if they

00:09:33.550 --> 00:09:36.520
hear from their peers
what the effect of actions

00:09:36.520 --> 00:09:37.990
is than if they--

00:09:37.990 --> 00:09:39.550
than if I impose
some kind of rule.

00:09:39.550 --> 00:09:42.900
So that's one of the
areas that we discuss.

00:09:42.900 --> 00:09:45.430
Another area that I
lead them in discussing

00:09:45.430 --> 00:09:49.480
is what do you do if you
have not prepared for class.

00:09:52.360 --> 00:09:55.791
And I let them decide
what do you do.

00:09:55.791 --> 00:09:56.290
OK.

00:09:56.290 --> 00:09:58.990
So this just turns out
to be far more effective

00:09:58.990 --> 00:10:01.450
than the professor saying I
want you to read everything

00:10:01.450 --> 00:10:04.960
before class, because we
all know that people--

00:10:04.960 --> 00:10:09.790
the record on how much people
read as is abysmal, right?

00:10:09.790 --> 00:10:12.010
So I feel like
it's my job to make

00:10:12.010 --> 00:10:15.580
what happens in class such
an exciting exercise that

00:10:15.580 --> 00:10:17.140
pulls on the
readings and they're

00:10:17.140 --> 00:10:20.020
working with their peers
that, if they haven't read,

00:10:20.020 --> 00:10:23.110
they're at a disadvantage
to enjoy and have fun

00:10:23.110 --> 00:10:25.570
with their peers-- or not
just fun, but, you know,

00:10:25.570 --> 00:10:28.330
deep learning experience
with regard to the material.

00:10:28.330 --> 00:10:30.310
That's my job.

00:10:30.310 --> 00:10:32.560
But they need to
decide, do you still

00:10:32.560 --> 00:10:33.850
come when you're not prepared?

00:10:33.850 --> 00:10:37.780
Again, is poking a giant hole
in the balloon of students

00:10:37.780 --> 00:10:41.020
pretending that they're
fully prepared and professors

00:10:41.020 --> 00:10:42.640
pretending that they don't know.

00:10:42.640 --> 00:10:44.140
Because, of course,
if you've taught

00:10:44.140 --> 00:10:47.020
the material for a while, you
know in a second if somebody

00:10:47.020 --> 00:10:48.460
has not read it.

00:10:48.460 --> 00:10:51.020
But you're supposed to pretend
like you don't realize that.

00:10:51.020 --> 00:10:54.100
So what I now have, often, is--

00:10:54.100 --> 00:10:58.030
they decide how are they
supposed to identify

00:10:58.030 --> 00:10:59.800
if they have not prepared.

00:10:59.800 --> 00:11:02.470
And sometimes, an
under-prepared student

00:11:02.470 --> 00:11:06.410
can be an advantage if
you leverage it correctly.

00:11:06.410 --> 00:11:09.580
So if you put the under-prepared
student in a small group

00:11:09.580 --> 00:11:11.470
with other students
who are prepared,

00:11:11.470 --> 00:11:15.310
the prepared students then
take on the role of teacher,

00:11:15.310 --> 00:11:17.270
and they get to learn
the material more deeply.

00:11:17.270 --> 00:11:18.760
Does that make some sense?

00:11:18.760 --> 00:11:22.000
So it doesn't have to
be a lose for everybody

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:24.520
when the inevitable happens.

00:11:24.520 --> 00:11:27.130
So a couple of other
areas we discuss.

00:11:27.130 --> 00:11:28.570
One is confidentiality.

00:11:28.570 --> 00:11:30.730
As you can imagine,
at the Div school,

00:11:30.730 --> 00:11:33.560
sometimes the material
gets very personal.

00:11:33.560 --> 00:11:35.950
And I think that's also true
in many of your classrooms

00:11:35.950 --> 00:11:37.040
as well.

00:11:37.040 --> 00:11:42.400
And so, what are you supposed
to do if something is shared

00:11:42.400 --> 00:11:43.390
that's very personal?

00:11:43.390 --> 00:11:46.000
Are you allowed to talk
about it when you go home,

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:49.000
or with other people
at the Div school?

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:50.840
And so forth.

00:11:50.840 --> 00:11:54.280
And then the fourth area
is a very significant one.

00:11:54.280 --> 00:11:57.010
And the way I
usually phrase it is,

00:11:57.010 --> 00:12:02.330
what do you do if the teacher
says something that's racist?

00:12:02.330 --> 00:12:03.560
Like, as in me, you know.

00:12:03.560 --> 00:12:10.040
I just, again, poke a giant
hole in my wish and desire

00:12:10.040 --> 00:12:12.200
to never make mistakes.

00:12:12.200 --> 00:12:15.440
And I still have that desire,
and I still feel awful

00:12:15.440 --> 00:12:17.210
when I do make mistakes.

00:12:17.210 --> 00:12:19.790
I decided a long
time ago I did not

00:12:19.790 --> 00:12:23.000
want to read on teaching
evaluations in July

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:26.030
that I stepped on
somebody in February.

00:12:26.030 --> 00:12:26.810
You know?

00:12:26.810 --> 00:12:28.940
This is just no fun for anybody.

00:12:28.940 --> 00:12:33.500
And it also damages the learning
environment so crucially

00:12:33.500 --> 00:12:38.360
when actions or words do
harm, either by the professor

00:12:38.360 --> 00:12:39.950
or other students.

00:12:39.950 --> 00:12:44.036
So instead of pretending, again,
like this will never happen,

00:12:44.036 --> 00:12:45.410
which then, of
course, shuts down

00:12:45.410 --> 00:12:49.850
the people who do get harmed by
such harmful speech or actions,

00:12:49.850 --> 00:12:53.480
I set it up that this
may happen, especially

00:12:53.480 --> 00:12:56.390
when we're talking about things
that matter a great deal, what

00:12:56.390 --> 00:12:57.980
do we do about it.

00:12:57.980 --> 00:13:02.340
Now, in all of these
areas that we discuss--

00:13:02.340 --> 00:13:05.630
and there's more than
I'm listing right now--

00:13:05.630 --> 00:13:07.850
part of the point is to
have a clear agreement

00:13:07.850 --> 00:13:12.080
about what the norms
are for the classroom.

00:13:12.080 --> 00:13:14.510
More to the point
is to have a norm

00:13:14.510 --> 00:13:19.280
for what you do when the
norms are violated and broken.

00:13:19.280 --> 00:13:22.130
If you don't have
this discussion,

00:13:22.130 --> 00:13:23.930
then any-- everybody
has in their minds

00:13:23.930 --> 00:13:25.580
what the norms should be.

00:13:25.580 --> 00:13:27.160
But it's different.

00:13:27.160 --> 00:13:29.120
So when you've had
that discussion,

00:13:29.120 --> 00:13:32.210
you have a way to
capture the learning that

00:13:32.210 --> 00:13:37.250
can come about in these
moments of difficulty.

00:13:37.250 --> 00:13:42.880
And most importantly, this
surfaces-- and I think today,

00:13:42.880 --> 00:13:44.990
overall, is supposed to
be about evaluation--

00:13:44.990 --> 00:13:48.580
my own deep conviction that,
while teachers and professors

00:13:48.580 --> 00:13:51.550
have a huge amount of
responsibility for what happens

00:13:51.550 --> 00:13:52.810
in the classroom, I don't--

00:13:52.810 --> 00:13:55.540
I don't abdicate my
responsibility one bit.

00:13:55.540 --> 00:13:59.380
So I tell the students,
I'm still bossy, you know.

00:13:59.380 --> 00:14:03.130
But I'm not the only person
responsible for the learning

00:14:03.130 --> 00:14:05.670
that's going on
in the classroom.

00:14:05.670 --> 00:14:08.730
And it is so awesome.

00:14:08.730 --> 00:14:10.960
I said it was like being
on the edge of a cliff.

00:14:10.960 --> 00:14:14.100
Let me tell you, when
you jump into that pool,

00:14:14.100 --> 00:14:17.550
you find out how trustworthy
those students are,

00:14:17.550 --> 00:14:21.750
how impressive they are,
what leaders they can be,

00:14:21.750 --> 00:14:25.840
and how beautiful it is to see
them build learning community.

00:14:25.840 --> 00:14:27.630
But all of your
students are as well.

00:14:27.630 --> 00:14:30.840
That's what the
work is that follows

00:14:30.840 --> 00:14:32.730
the educational experience.

00:14:32.730 --> 00:14:35.880
So I like to give them a real
time experience of how hard it

00:14:35.880 --> 00:14:37.677
is to build community.

00:14:37.677 --> 00:14:38.760
Do I have one more minute?

00:14:38.760 --> 00:14:39.635
Or are we at the end?

00:14:43.710 --> 00:14:46.350
So one-- I'll just tell
you really brief story.

00:14:46.350 --> 00:14:49.650
One time, I had a
relatively small class,

00:14:49.650 --> 00:14:53.100
and a couple of students
were taping the class,

00:14:53.100 --> 00:14:55.800
and a couple of
other students felt

00:14:55.800 --> 00:14:58.200
they didn't feel comfortable
to fully participate

00:14:58.200 --> 00:15:00.180
because the class
was being taped.

00:15:00.180 --> 00:15:02.700
Those who were taping were
English as a second language

00:15:02.700 --> 00:15:03.760
learners.

00:15:03.760 --> 00:15:08.040
So there were really legitimate
concerns on both sides.

00:15:08.040 --> 00:15:10.740
So I engaged them in a
full discussion of it,

00:15:10.740 --> 00:15:12.720
didn't get resolved.

00:15:12.720 --> 00:15:16.050
Had another full discussion
of it, didn't get resolved.

00:15:16.050 --> 00:15:17.640
I didn't resolve it.

00:15:17.640 --> 00:15:19.800
Students got really,
really angry with me.

00:15:19.800 --> 00:15:21.570
I got e-mails,
and, you know, this

00:15:21.570 --> 00:15:23.210
is your job to resolve this.

00:15:23.210 --> 00:15:26.010
In a little while later, I
was teaching the Ron Heifetz

00:15:26.010 --> 00:15:28.380
material about the
flight to authority

00:15:28.380 --> 00:15:30.360
when problems get
really difficult.

00:15:30.360 --> 00:15:32.190
And as I was teaching
that, they went,

00:15:32.190 --> 00:15:33.990
oh, that's what we were doing.

00:15:33.990 --> 00:15:37.620
We were flying to you to
resolve things that you

00:15:37.620 --> 00:15:39.080
were saying belong to us.

00:15:39.080 --> 00:15:41.510
So that's it.

00:15:41.510 --> 00:15:44.430
[APPLAUSE]

00:15:44.430 --> 00:15:47.340
So I want to thank Emily for
sharing not only her story,

00:15:47.340 --> 00:15:49.664
but also such a really
powerful teaching practice that

00:15:49.664 --> 00:15:51.705
can help both in the area
of creating connections

00:15:51.705 --> 00:15:53.220
and increasing engagement.

00:15:53.220 --> 00:15:54.810
So thank you for that.

00:15:54.810 --> 00:15:56.940
And now, I'd like to
invite Jonathan Hausmann,

00:15:56.940 --> 00:15:59.550
from the Medical School, up
to share some of his teaching

00:15:59.550 --> 00:16:00.490
practices with us.

00:16:03.820 --> 00:16:05.170
Thank you for inviting me.

00:16:05.170 --> 00:16:07.760
So I'm a rheumatologist.

00:16:07.760 --> 00:16:10.960
And every year we go to
our national rheumatology

00:16:10.960 --> 00:16:11.710
conference.

00:16:11.710 --> 00:16:13.930
It's usually held
in fancy places,

00:16:13.930 --> 00:16:16.720
like Chicago and San Diego.

00:16:16.720 --> 00:16:22.080
And it's five days of
really intense break--

00:16:22.080 --> 00:16:25.120
you know, breathtaking
lectures about all sorts

00:16:25.120 --> 00:16:27.280
of different topics
in rheumatology.

00:16:27.280 --> 00:16:31.060
And I remember one
time, several years ago,

00:16:31.060 --> 00:16:34.420
after I came back, my
wife asked me how it went.

00:16:34.420 --> 00:16:35.690
I said, great.

00:16:35.690 --> 00:16:37.880
Then she asked me,
what did you learn?

00:16:37.880 --> 00:16:40.620
And really, I sat
there for a while.

00:16:40.620 --> 00:16:43.750
And I really didn't know what
to say because I didn't remember

00:16:43.750 --> 00:16:47.680
much of the material
that was presented

00:16:47.680 --> 00:16:49.310
during the conference.

00:16:49.310 --> 00:16:53.470
And then I sort of--
that's when my interest

00:16:53.470 --> 00:16:55.720
peaked about how we learn.

00:16:55.720 --> 00:16:58.240
And I sort of started
doing some research

00:16:58.240 --> 00:17:00.940
about cognitive
learning theories.

00:17:00.940 --> 00:17:03.520
And I realized that lecturers--

00:17:03.520 --> 00:17:05.349
sort of like what
I'm doing now--

00:17:05.349 --> 00:17:08.650
are a lousy way for
people to learn, right?

00:17:08.650 --> 00:17:12.490
So just by sitting there,
you're being very passive,

00:17:12.490 --> 00:17:15.319
you're not doing any learning.

00:17:15.319 --> 00:17:17.859
So it's not very effective.

00:17:17.859 --> 00:17:21.069
Thankfully, I thought, OK,
good thing it's not just me,

00:17:21.069 --> 00:17:22.569
it's the lectures.

00:17:22.569 --> 00:17:25.690
So you know, I read a
lot about active learning

00:17:25.690 --> 00:17:28.900
and how, really, we should
get rid of lectures.

00:17:28.900 --> 00:17:31.390
And tons of
publications have shown

00:17:31.390 --> 00:17:35.970
the benefit of active
learning for the learner.

00:17:35.970 --> 00:17:40.500
But here I was in
my medical training.

00:17:40.500 --> 00:17:41.990
Things weren't changing.

00:17:41.990 --> 00:17:42.600
Right?

00:17:42.600 --> 00:17:44.880
We still had grand rounds,
which was a lecture.

00:17:44.880 --> 00:17:46.890
We had journal clubs,
which is a lecture.

00:17:46.890 --> 00:17:50.700
We had case conference,
which is, usually, a lecture.

00:17:50.700 --> 00:17:54.990
And all of my didactic
acts were still lectures.

00:17:54.990 --> 00:17:57.760
So I said, OK, I can't
get rid of lectures.

00:17:57.760 --> 00:18:01.030
So how can we make a
lecture more effective?

00:18:01.030 --> 00:18:03.180
Well, there's a lot of
ways that professors can

00:18:03.180 --> 00:18:05.310
make lectures more effective.

00:18:05.310 --> 00:18:11.070
And sort of the tool that I
learned was through questions.

00:18:11.070 --> 00:18:14.100
So we talked a little bit
about questions this morning

00:18:14.100 --> 00:18:15.600
in the panel.

00:18:15.600 --> 00:18:19.050
And really, the great thing
that I like about questions

00:18:19.050 --> 00:18:23.680
is that they are a form
of retrieval practice.

00:18:23.680 --> 00:18:24.180
OK?

00:18:24.180 --> 00:18:27.640
So questions not only
assess whether you're

00:18:27.640 --> 00:18:30.450
a learner actually
knows the material,

00:18:30.450 --> 00:18:33.450
but it actually enhances
those neural connections

00:18:33.450 --> 00:18:36.330
for that information
so that, next time

00:18:36.330 --> 00:18:40.050
that they are asked that
question, they know it better.

00:18:40.050 --> 00:18:44.760
So questions actually help
people learn and help people

00:18:44.760 --> 00:18:48.900
retain that material
throughout their learning.

00:18:48.900 --> 00:18:51.090
Like we said this
morning, it's not just

00:18:51.090 --> 00:18:53.010
about how you do on
the test, but it's

00:18:53.010 --> 00:18:56.380
how you remember that stuff
10 years down the road,

00:18:56.380 --> 00:18:58.680
and how it affects your career.

00:18:58.680 --> 00:18:59.580
So great.

00:18:59.580 --> 00:19:04.620
So I found out that, if
the instructor provides

00:19:04.620 --> 00:19:07.890
the audience with
questions at the beginning

00:19:07.890 --> 00:19:11.430
of the presentation, that
can actually help to increase

00:19:11.430 --> 00:19:14.130
curiosity throughout
the lecture, and makes

00:19:14.130 --> 00:19:16.470
people learn things better.

00:19:16.470 --> 00:19:20.310
I learned that if the lecture
provides an opportunity

00:19:20.310 --> 00:19:25.650
for to ask questions in the
middle of the presentation,

00:19:25.650 --> 00:19:28.740
and have students try
to apply the material

00:19:28.740 --> 00:19:30.800
that they learned
in a new setting,

00:19:30.800 --> 00:19:34.690
that that's also
effective for learning.

00:19:34.690 --> 00:19:38.010
And then I learned that,
if the instructor provides

00:19:38.010 --> 00:19:41.820
a short quiz after
the lecture, that also

00:19:41.820 --> 00:19:44.190
helps to enhance learning,
and those students

00:19:44.190 --> 00:19:48.780
do better on the tests
weeks or months later on.

00:19:48.780 --> 00:19:49.280
OK.

00:19:49.280 --> 00:19:49.821
That's great.

00:19:49.821 --> 00:19:53.180
But still, my professors
weren't doing that.

00:19:53.180 --> 00:19:56.150
All those good things that
the literature supported still

00:19:56.150 --> 00:19:57.650
wasn't happening.

00:19:57.650 --> 00:19:59.540
So I said, OK, that's great.

00:19:59.540 --> 00:20:02.090
So what can I do
as a learner to try

00:20:02.090 --> 00:20:06.340
to make those experiences
more effective?

00:20:06.340 --> 00:20:08.770
And sort of what I stumbled
into the literature

00:20:08.770 --> 00:20:13.680
was this idea of
learner-generated questions.

00:20:13.680 --> 00:20:15.210
So learner-generated questions.

00:20:15.210 --> 00:20:20.040
So these are questions that
the learner asks and answers

00:20:20.040 --> 00:20:22.800
after any educational
experience.

00:20:22.800 --> 00:20:26.310
So if it's a
lecture about lupus,

00:20:26.310 --> 00:20:29.640
at the end of the lecture
I would think about, OK,

00:20:29.640 --> 00:20:31.710
what was important
about this lecture?

00:20:31.710 --> 00:20:33.390
How can they make
that into a question?

00:20:33.390 --> 00:20:36.360
How can they answer
that question?

00:20:36.360 --> 00:20:40.150
And the literature shows that
learner-generated questions

00:20:40.150 --> 00:20:46.210
are as effective for learning as
instructor-generated questions.

00:20:46.210 --> 00:20:49.370
So that's kind of cool.

00:20:49.370 --> 00:20:51.820
What the literature also
says is that learn--

00:20:51.820 --> 00:20:56.450
if you teach your learner to
generate their own questions,

00:20:56.450 --> 00:21:00.580
for example, after a lecture,
it actually changes the way

00:21:00.580 --> 00:21:02.620
that they see the lecture.

00:21:02.620 --> 00:21:06.760
It actually-- it's sort of like
a metacognitive strategy that

00:21:06.760 --> 00:21:12.010
can be employed, whereby
they are able to, as they

00:21:12.010 --> 00:21:15.220
are listening to the lecture, to
start thinking about questions

00:21:15.220 --> 00:21:16.830
and start answering
in their mind.

00:21:16.830 --> 00:21:19.130
OK, this question came up.

00:21:19.130 --> 00:21:21.140
Here's how I would answer it.

00:21:21.140 --> 00:21:24.040
And the studies show that if
you teach them these skills,

00:21:24.040 --> 00:21:28.000
they actually learn the
lecture material a lot better.

00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:31.460
And same thing has been
shown after reading material.

00:21:31.460 --> 00:21:33.520
So if you ask them
to read an article,

00:21:33.520 --> 00:21:36.850
and ask them to generate
questions and answer

00:21:36.850 --> 00:21:38.860
the questions after
the article, they

00:21:38.860 --> 00:21:42.710
retain that material
much better.

00:21:42.710 --> 00:21:43.210
OK.

00:21:43.210 --> 00:21:44.650
So that was pretty cool.

00:21:44.650 --> 00:21:49.270
So what I started doing during
my fellowship was just that.

00:21:49.270 --> 00:21:53.080
So at the end of
every case conference,

00:21:53.080 --> 00:21:57.790
journal club, grand rounds,
I would generate a question.

00:21:57.790 --> 00:22:01.390
I would do a multiple choice
question with the answers.

00:22:01.390 --> 00:22:04.810
And then I would start
sending it to my co Fellows.

00:22:04.810 --> 00:22:07.210
And they kind of like it,
and they got really engaged.

00:22:07.210 --> 00:22:10.330
And I noticed that they became
more engaged in the lectures

00:22:10.330 --> 00:22:12.850
because they knew that I
would test them in the end.

00:22:12.850 --> 00:22:16.150
And these were tests that,
you know, meant nothing.

00:22:16.150 --> 00:22:20.380
We don't get graded in
our fellowships very much.

00:22:20.380 --> 00:22:21.850
And then the attending started.

00:22:21.850 --> 00:22:24.700
My bosses started to
really get into it.

00:22:24.700 --> 00:22:26.500
And they wanted to
participate, too.

00:22:26.500 --> 00:22:29.050
And our nurses started
participating as well.

00:22:29.050 --> 00:22:30.730
So I was generating
the questions,

00:22:30.730 --> 00:22:33.619
and then I would send
it out to the team.

00:22:33.619 --> 00:22:35.660
But then, they wanted the
opportunity-- you know,

00:22:35.660 --> 00:22:41.480
I realized that the question
generation was probably the--

00:22:41.480 --> 00:22:45.500
that's where sort of the most
bang for your buck came from.

00:22:45.500 --> 00:22:47.129
So it's not
necessarily answering

00:22:47.129 --> 00:22:48.170
other people's questions.

00:22:48.170 --> 00:22:52.040
But I thought that, by me
creating a question, that's

00:22:52.040 --> 00:22:54.560
really allowed me to sort
of distill the material

00:22:54.560 --> 00:22:56.720
and make it my own.

00:22:56.720 --> 00:22:59.900
So then I decided,
OK, for every lecture,

00:22:59.900 --> 00:23:02.090
I will assign somebody
to generate questions

00:23:02.090 --> 00:23:06.690
and then we'll distribute
it amongst ourselves.

00:23:06.690 --> 00:23:08.760
So I took that a step further.

00:23:08.760 --> 00:23:13.200
A few years ago, I got a HILT
Spark grant to actually create

00:23:13.200 --> 00:23:15.420
an app to do this.

00:23:15.420 --> 00:23:20.640
So the way that the app works is
that the learners can generate

00:23:20.640 --> 00:23:26.940
questions and answers, and this
gets distributed through people

00:23:26.940 --> 00:23:28.890
within the same course.

00:23:28.890 --> 00:23:33.120
And so, not only do the students
get a benefit from generating

00:23:33.120 --> 00:23:36.030
their own questions and
answers, which I think

00:23:36.030 --> 00:23:38.610
is the best thing
about it, but then you

00:23:38.610 --> 00:23:40.260
have this beautiful
question that you

00:23:40.260 --> 00:23:42.630
can share with your colleagues.

00:23:42.630 --> 00:23:44.910
And they can try to
answer your questions,

00:23:44.910 --> 00:23:50.280
and also provide feedback on
that question saying, you know,

00:23:50.280 --> 00:23:53.800
its a good question, though
I didn't understand this.

00:23:53.800 --> 00:23:59.040
So it was a great tool,
and we sort of piloted

00:23:59.040 --> 00:24:00.990
in the medical school
and learned a lot

00:24:00.990 --> 00:24:03.930
about how students learn,
what they liked about the app,

00:24:03.930 --> 00:24:06.150
what they didn't
like about the app.

00:24:06.150 --> 00:24:09.660
And there were certainly some
things that we needed to fix.

00:24:09.660 --> 00:24:15.000
And we actually got a second
HILT development grant

00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:19.420
to sort of buff up the app
and make it even better.

00:24:19.420 --> 00:24:22.890
But these skills of question
generation for your learners

00:24:22.890 --> 00:24:25.320
doesn't require an app.

00:24:25.320 --> 00:24:28.350
You can just get them
a note card, right?

00:24:28.350 --> 00:24:29.290
At the end of class.

00:24:29.290 --> 00:24:33.720
Is like, OK, write on the front
of the note card one question

00:24:33.720 --> 00:24:37.620
that this presentation
brought up,

00:24:37.620 --> 00:24:39.750
and then write down the answer.

00:24:39.750 --> 00:24:41.940
And they get a
benefit from that,

00:24:41.940 --> 00:24:45.220
and then they can share
that with their classmates.

00:24:45.220 --> 00:24:48.689
And so that everybody--
sort of everybody wins.

00:24:48.689 --> 00:24:49.980
So that's what I've been doing.

00:24:49.980 --> 00:24:51.700
So stay tuned for the app.

00:24:51.700 --> 00:24:55.900
The app is called Ask Up.

00:24:55.900 --> 00:24:58.230
So it's out there
now, but it's--

00:24:58.230 --> 00:24:59.610
we need to do some updates.

00:24:59.610 --> 00:25:02.100
But hopefully, by
next year we'll

00:25:02.100 --> 00:25:04.480
have a working up
that it's free to use.

00:25:04.480 --> 00:25:07.740
And I would welcome use of the
app and in your classrooms.

00:25:07.740 --> 00:25:08.240
Thanks.

00:25:08.240 --> 00:25:12.170
[APPLAUSE]

00:25:12.170 --> 00:25:15.200
Thank you so much
to Emily and to John

00:25:15.200 --> 00:25:17.480
for sharing some of
your experiences,

00:25:17.480 --> 00:25:20.900
and how they really have had
an impact on your classroom

00:25:20.900 --> 00:25:23.720
and on your students' learning.

00:25:23.720 --> 00:25:28.040
Our hope for today is
that you can all come away

00:25:28.040 --> 00:25:32.840
with some ideas for how you can
make small, targeted changes

00:25:32.840 --> 00:25:38.450
to your teaching that are not
so big that you need to overhaul

00:25:38.450 --> 00:25:40.940
your syllabus or have
that enormous feeling

00:25:40.940 --> 00:25:43.640
of vulnerability that
we've often feel when we're

00:25:43.640 --> 00:25:45.540
trying to make changes.

00:25:45.540 --> 00:25:47.390
These are all things
that can be done

00:25:47.390 --> 00:25:49.610
in a variety of
different class sizes,

00:25:49.610 --> 00:25:52.290
and in a variety
of different times.

00:25:52.290 --> 00:25:55.170
So oftentimes, less
than five minutes.

00:25:55.170 --> 00:25:59.410
So this is when we get to the
mysterious cards on your table.

00:25:59.410 --> 00:26:02.235
If you want to take a minute
and just turn over those cards.

00:26:05.460 --> 00:26:07.140
We have another activity.

00:26:12.550 --> 00:26:13.050
All right.

00:26:13.050 --> 00:26:14.674
So there's a number
of different decks.

00:26:14.674 --> 00:26:17.000
You can kind of
separate them out here.

00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:20.090
And here's where
we are going to do.

00:26:20.090 --> 00:26:21.860
Back in the icebreaker,
we asked you

00:26:21.860 --> 00:26:25.700
to think about a challenge
or an opportunity for growth

00:26:25.700 --> 00:26:29.330
and for change that you have
identified in your own course.

00:26:29.330 --> 00:26:32.000
And Emily also
brought up this idea

00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:35.270
of having an
adjective that of what

00:26:35.270 --> 00:26:38.310
you want your course to be like.

00:26:38.310 --> 00:26:42.800
And so what these cards
are are a way for you

00:26:42.800 --> 00:26:47.810
to find ideas of solutions
to those challenges.

00:26:47.810 --> 00:26:50.840
And what we want to do is-- in
a second we're going to ask you

00:26:50.840 --> 00:26:53.450
all to stand up and walk
around the room again--

00:26:53.450 --> 00:26:58.640
is find one or two solutions
in these cards that you think

00:26:58.640 --> 00:27:02.006
might solve the challenges
that you've identified.

00:27:02.006 --> 00:27:03.380
Or if you see one
that might work

00:27:03.380 --> 00:27:05.921
for one of those people you were
talking to in the beginning,

00:27:05.921 --> 00:27:08.090
you can grab a card for them to.

00:27:08.090 --> 00:27:09.770
So you'll notice the
cards are divided

00:27:09.770 --> 00:27:11.420
into different categories.

00:27:11.420 --> 00:27:14.600
In our front three
tables here, we

00:27:14.600 --> 00:27:17.570
have cards related
to active learning

00:27:17.570 --> 00:27:19.940
and to what we call
mini experiences, which

00:27:19.940 --> 00:27:23.660
are ways of taking an
experiential learning activity,

00:27:23.660 --> 00:27:27.890
like a role play, and doing
it in a smaller form that

00:27:27.890 --> 00:27:30.680
isn't so big to take on.

00:27:30.680 --> 00:27:34.040
In our second row here,
the middle three tables,

00:27:34.040 --> 00:27:37.610
we have cards that relate
to community building,

00:27:37.610 --> 00:27:40.820
to icebreakers, which are really
a form of community building,

00:27:40.820 --> 00:27:43.650
and also to small
group activities.

00:27:43.650 --> 00:27:46.490
So if when you were listening
to Emily you were thinking, wow,

00:27:46.490 --> 00:27:49.130
I really want to have some
ideas for how I can better

00:27:49.130 --> 00:27:51.770
build community in my course
and get my students engaged

00:27:51.770 --> 00:27:55.550
that way, those middle three
tables have ideas for you.

00:27:55.550 --> 00:27:58.160
And then the back
three tables have

00:27:58.160 --> 00:28:02.060
ideas for what we've called
a structured study, which

00:28:02.060 --> 00:28:04.250
is, if the challenges
you're thinking about

00:28:04.250 --> 00:28:06.650
are my students aren't getting
as much out of the reading

00:28:06.650 --> 00:28:09.470
as I wish they were, I wish
they had more study skills

00:28:09.470 --> 00:28:11.660
and more directed study
for outside of class,

00:28:11.660 --> 00:28:13.040
there's ideas there.

00:28:13.040 --> 00:28:15.500
Or what we call setting
the stage, which

00:28:15.500 --> 00:28:19.640
is things you can do in the
first five minutes of lecture

00:28:19.640 --> 00:28:22.370
to try to get your students
more involved and engaged,

00:28:22.370 --> 00:28:24.140
and to activate
some of that recall.

00:28:24.140 --> 00:28:27.110
So if what John was talking
about was appealing to you,

00:28:27.110 --> 00:28:30.420
you want to head to
those back three tables.

00:28:30.420 --> 00:28:33.320
So we will be--

00:28:33.320 --> 00:28:36.140
your goal, find two cards.

00:28:36.140 --> 00:28:39.950
You're going to have about
15 minutes to do this.

00:28:39.950 --> 00:28:41.480
We're going to do the poll?

00:28:41.480 --> 00:28:42.140
Yes.

00:28:42.140 --> 00:28:45.770
And we are launching a
Poll Everywhere poll.

00:28:45.770 --> 00:28:47.960
How many of you have ever
used Poll Everywhere?

00:28:47.960 --> 00:28:49.687
All right, a number of you.

00:28:49.687 --> 00:28:50.770
So what's going to happen?

00:28:50.770 --> 00:28:52.580
Erin's going to pull
it up on the screen.

00:28:52.580 --> 00:28:55.530
You use your cell
phone for this.

00:28:55.530 --> 00:28:58.220
It will give you
a number to text,

00:28:58.220 --> 00:29:00.990
and the message that
you're supposed to text.

00:29:00.990 --> 00:29:04.160
So in this case, the phone
number that you text to

00:29:04.160 --> 00:29:05.640
is 22333.

00:29:05.640 --> 00:29:09.140
And you text that
phrase, HILT 2017.

00:29:09.140 --> 00:29:10.590
And it will come back to you.

00:29:10.590 --> 00:29:12.500
It will activate the poll.

00:29:12.500 --> 00:29:15.650
And what we're
asking you to do here

00:29:15.650 --> 00:29:20.660
is, if, as you're coming across
these cards, you see any ideas

00:29:20.660 --> 00:29:23.270
that you might want to implement
or that you might have ideas

00:29:23.270 --> 00:29:28.232
to adapt, you can text
your ideas to this poll,

00:29:28.232 --> 00:29:29.690
and they'll all go
up on the screen

00:29:29.690 --> 00:29:32.170
so we can all share them.

00:29:32.170 --> 00:29:34.820
Everybody clear on
what we're doing?

00:29:34.820 --> 00:29:37.240
So can I ask everyone
to make your way back

00:29:37.240 --> 00:29:39.552
to your icebreaker group?

00:29:39.552 --> 00:29:42.010
Because we're going to end with
an opportunity for everyone

00:29:42.010 --> 00:29:43.996
to share with each
other ideas you

00:29:43.996 --> 00:29:45.370
have had from
finding a card that

00:29:45.370 --> 00:29:48.520
might apply to someone else's
opportunity for improvement,

00:29:48.520 --> 00:29:52.890
or just whatever thought
that you might have had

00:29:52.890 --> 00:29:54.140
as you look through the cards.

00:29:54.140 --> 00:29:56.890
And as you're getting
there, I would just

00:29:56.890 --> 00:30:01.280
like to mention a couple
of things about the cards.

00:30:01.280 --> 00:30:05.950
So first of all, our
apologies for not already

00:30:05.950 --> 00:30:10.600
having these available for
you to have as a digital copy.

00:30:10.600 --> 00:30:13.570
That's something that we can
easily do and intend to do.

00:30:13.570 --> 00:30:16.140
We just didn't get around to
it before the actual session.

00:30:16.140 --> 00:30:20.020
So in some form in the
HILT conference follow up,

00:30:20.020 --> 00:30:23.140
you will receive a link to
where you can get the PDF

00:30:23.140 --> 00:30:24.940
and download all of these cards.

00:30:24.940 --> 00:30:27.310
We'd like to also make
the template available so

00:30:27.310 --> 00:30:28.647
that people can add.

00:30:28.647 --> 00:30:30.480
There are many other
great ideas, obviously,

00:30:30.480 --> 00:30:32.980
I think many of you are having
as you go around about things

00:30:32.980 --> 00:30:34.550
that fit in these categories.

00:30:34.550 --> 00:30:35.801
So we'll be doing that.

00:30:35.801 --> 00:30:37.300
The second thing I
wanted to mention

00:30:37.300 --> 00:30:39.910
is that the idea
with the cards was

00:30:39.910 --> 00:30:42.640
that the little ones are easy
for you to pick up and take

00:30:42.640 --> 00:30:43.552
along with you.

00:30:43.552 --> 00:30:45.010
And you should
certainly feel free.

00:30:45.010 --> 00:30:47.920
So take as many cards
as are sparking an idea

00:30:47.920 --> 00:30:49.790
that you'd like to pursue.

00:30:49.790 --> 00:30:53.440
So what we'd like to do
to finish off this session

00:30:53.440 --> 00:30:55.810
is to have you continue
in the small groups

00:30:55.810 --> 00:30:57.760
and speak with each
other about ideas

00:30:57.760 --> 00:31:01.090
that you found interesting
and, perhaps, to have

00:31:01.090 --> 00:31:02.680
a little opportunity
to recognize

00:31:02.680 --> 00:31:05.080
the ways in which even
implementing these small ideas

00:31:05.080 --> 00:31:07.250
is a little bit like
jumping off a cliff.

00:31:07.250 --> 00:31:08.740
So thinking about
how they actually

00:31:08.740 --> 00:31:11.107
function in the context
of your classroom.

00:31:11.107 --> 00:31:12.940
Because, sometimes,
it's not quite as simple

00:31:12.940 --> 00:31:15.670
as a little card makes it look.

00:31:15.670 --> 00:31:17.770
So please, enjoy those
final conversations,

00:31:17.770 --> 00:31:19.840
and this will be
the moment where

00:31:19.840 --> 00:31:22.990
we thank you for your
participation in this session.

00:31:22.990 --> 00:31:27.727
And let's just altogether give
ourselves round of applause,

00:31:27.727 --> 00:31:29.060
and, particularly, our speakers.

00:31:29.060 --> 00:31:29.660
Thank you.

00:31:29.660 --> 00:31:33.310
[APPLAUSE]
