00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.808
Today, we are going to talk about revenue

00:00:01.808 --> 00:00:03.830
models. Very simply is, how does your

00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:06.870
company make money. So in our last lectures

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:08.791
we talked about value proposition, customer

00:00:08.791 --> 00:00:12.361
segments, distribution channels, customer

00:00:12.361 --> 00:00:14.709
relationships; get, keeping and growing

00:00:14.709 --> 00:00:16.874
customers. But today we’re going to be talking

00:00:16.874 --> 00:00:19.927
about revenue streams. How is it that you make

00:00:19.927 --> 00:00:21.111
money?

00:00:21.111 --> 00:00:24.006
Now revenue models seems incredibly simple,

00:00:24.006 --> 00:00:26.258
it answers the question, how does the company

00:00:26.258 --> 00:00:29.581
make money from each customer segment.

00:00:29.581 --> 00:00:32.095
But one of the things that we always tend to

00:00:32.095 --> 00:00:34.985
confuse is the difference between a revenue

00:00:34.985 --> 00:00:38.783
model and pricing. That is the amount of dollars

00:00:38.783 --> 00:00:41.301
that we might actually charge for the product.

00:00:41.301 --> 00:00:43.317
And this is a common mistake. What we’re

00:00:43.317 --> 00:00:46.784
really trying to understand first is what value is

00:00:46.784 --> 00:00:49.368
the customer paying for. And the first thing we

00:00:49.368 --> 00:00:51.712
need to figure out is, what is our revenue model.

00:00:51.712 --> 00:00:54.718
What’s the revenue stream. That’s our strategy.

00:00:54.718 --> 00:00:57.718
But what follows is then pricing. What is our

00:00:57.718 --> 00:01:00.539
tactics? So again, what we’re going to try to

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:04.081
figure out is what’s our strategy? Revenue

00:01:04.081 --> 00:01:07.557
streams. And what’s our tactics? Pricing.

00:01:07.557 --> 00:01:10.925
And together that means, how does a company

00:01:10.925 --> 00:01:13.807
make money from each customer segment.
