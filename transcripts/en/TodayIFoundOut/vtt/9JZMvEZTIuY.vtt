00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:09.900
Why do People Tell Actors to Break a Leg?

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:13.849
The term, of course, means “do well” or
“have a great show” and is typically used

00:00:13.849 --> 00:00:14.969
before a stage performance, a show, or an
audition.

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:16.430
(I have never heard it used before filming
a movie on any of the movies I’ve been involved

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:17.430
with, but I guess it can be used in that sense
too).

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:18.430
But I’m sure you’re more interested in
the origin of “break a leg”.

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:21.680
Like many popular sayings and terms, the origin
of “break a leg” is nebulous and disputed.

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:26.890
The term “break a leg” was used originally,
many say, to discourage evil spirits from

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:29.820
deliberately causing one’s performance to
suffer.

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:34.010
According to this theory, wishing someone
“good luck” would be invoking the “evil

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:35.010
eye”.

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:38.180
So “good luck” would actually cause bad
luck for the actor.

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:42.750
Thus, “break a leg”, by this logic, would
be a wish for good luck.

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:46.800
This is in line with the first documented
instance of someone saying “break a leg”

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.440
in terms of wishing them luck.

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:54.670
In an October 1, 1921 edition of the New Statesman,
Robert Wilson Lynd is talking about it being

00:00:54.670 --> 00:01:00.340
unlucky in horse racing to wish someone luck
so “you should say something insulting such

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:02.370
as, ‘May you break your leg!”

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:07.100
He also mentions that theater people are the
second most superstitious group next to those

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:09.020
involved in horse racing.

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:13.780
Another of the early documented references
of “break a leg”, this time directly referring

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:21.240
to theater, was in the 1939 A Peculiar Treasure
by Edna Ferber, where she implies a different

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:25.889
motive, “…and all the understudies sitting
in the back row politely wishing the various

00:01:25.889 --> 00:01:27.909
principals would break a leg”.

00:01:27.909 --> 00:01:32.389
Thus, they say it hoping the principal actors
will break their leg so the understudies can

00:01:32.389 --> 00:01:34.090
possibly take the lead.

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:38.630
Another possible construction is the German
phrase “Hans un beinbruch”.

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:41.890
The sentiment here is “Happy landings”
in English.

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:46.860
Both English and German pilots use the term,
but the literal translation is “breaking

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:48.509
all one’s bones”.

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:53.159
It is possible actors adopted this phrase,
as it was just after WWI that the “break

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:56.889
a leg” sentiment seems to have gained widespread
popularity.

00:01:56.889 --> 00:02:00.719
The term “break a leg” may be traced back
to the Elizabethan language.

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:05.950
To “break a leg”, in Shakespeare’s time,
meant, literally, to bow- by bending at the

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:06.950
knee.

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:10.860
Since a successful actor would “break a
leg” onstage and receive applause, the phrase

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:13.160
would, in effect, be a wish for good luck.

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:18.200
However, in the 16th century “break a leg”
also meant to give birth to an illegitimate

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:22.150
child, which is hard to connect to the theatrical
world.

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:26.780
Others trace “break a leg” to the tradition
of audiences in Ancient Greece.

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:30.569
Instead of applauding actors, audiences would
stomp their feet.

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:34.910
Stomping to the point of actually breaking
a leg is unlikely- but still, the phrase may

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:37.640
be figurative and not literal.

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:43.019
An interesting historical theory attributes
“break a leg” to the assassination of

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:44.569
Abraham Lincoln.

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:50.040
This theory traces the term to the great 19th
century actor, John Wilkes Booth, who, of

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:54.650
course, shot President Lincoln at Ford’s
Theater in 1865.

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:59.340
After Booth shot the President, he jumped
from Lincoln’s upper box seat onto the stage,

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:01.700
where he literally “broke his leg”.

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:06.579
(Some also present this as a possibly origin
of the popular phrase comedians and comics

00:03:06.579 --> 00:03:09.540
use for a successful show: “I killed them.”

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:10.849
/ “I killed the audience.”)

00:03:10.849 --> 00:03:15.000
Landing a role in show business is called
“getting a break” and being newly successful

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.269
is called “breaking into the business”.

00:03:17.269 --> 00:03:20.299
These also may be where the “break a leg”
term evolves from.

00:03:20.299 --> 00:03:23.890
So as you can see here, the exact origin of
“break a leg” for wishing someone luck

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:25.530
is murky at best.

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:30.290
But whatever first spawned the exact phrase,
it seems plausible enough that it either grew

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:34.900
in popularity from the idea of wishing bad
luck on someone so that they’ll in turn

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:40.989
be given good luck, as the early documented
references of the phrase imply, or in sarcastically

00:03:40.989 --> 00:03:45.090
wishing them bad luck so that the understudy
could perhaps take over the role of one of

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:59.440
the principals if the principal actually broke
their leg.
