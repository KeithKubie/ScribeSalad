GARY LO: I want people to
enjoy finding their next home.

00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:10.994
I want people to
be happy when they

00:00:10.994 --> 00:00:12.410
imagine what it's
going to be like

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:14.330
for them to live in this home.

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:16.920
To be part of that process
is a real privilege.

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:19.780
Yeah, that's what it's
really about for me.

00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:20.530
My name's Gary Lo.

00:00:20.530 --> 00:00:24.780
I'm the lead Android
developer at Domain.

00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:26.490
We provide search
tools, information

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:30.030
for buyers, investors, sellers,
renters, and agents Australia

00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:30.650
wide.

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:32.870
We're a big company
with over 500 people

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:34.540
and a number of
different products.

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:36.415
We have three developers
on the Android team,

00:00:36.415 --> 00:00:39.669
and we work very closely
with our Design and UX teams.

00:00:39.669 --> 00:00:40.960
HENRIQUE MARASSI: I'm Henrique.

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:43.200
I'm product manager
here at Domain.

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.520
It's been a very
interesting time for us.

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:50.330
Our Android app has come a long
way over the past few years.

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:53.870
When Gary and I started, that
was really counterintuitive.

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:55.820
There were problems
with navigation,

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:58.340
and user feedback
was really poor.

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:59.840
GARY LO: We had to
educate our team,

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:01.800
and we designed our
app specifically

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.197
for the Android platform.

00:01:03.197 --> 00:01:04.780
HENRIQUE MARASSI:
We were really lucky

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:07.940
that the business supported
us and really invested

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:10.572
in developing a best
practice Android app.

00:01:10.572 --> 00:01:12.530
GARY LO: Once we did a
very standard framework,

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:14.696
we really started to take
advantage of all the tools

00:01:14.696 --> 00:01:16.140
that Google and Android gave us.

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:18.610
We wanted to provide the
user with understanding

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:20.710
of the surroundings
of a property.

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:21.890
We've got Google Maps.

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:24.010
We wanted timely
notifications to the user,

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:25.520
and we've got GCM Push.

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:28.140
We wanted to help users
discover companies

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.570
as they walk along the street,
and you've got geo-fencing.

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:32.390
Play's services just
makes it so easy

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:36.320
for us to create
those experiences.

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:38.630
HENRIQUE MARASSI: 2014 was
a really big year for us.

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:42.320
We released a number of great
features-- finger search,

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:46.280
integration with Google Now,
and adoption of material design.

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:48.880
GARY LO: Material design gives
you a very strong guideline

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:50.470
as to how to design an app.

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:54.090
It just makes the experience
so much more immersive.

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:56.070
And the response was amazing.

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:59.220
We've had a 44% increase
in monthly downloads,

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:01.600
placing Domain app in
the top five lifestyle

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:03.590
apps in Australia.

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:06.770
Being able to hear real people
tell us how great the app is

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:10.340
and how it's helped them
find a home is fantastic.

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:12.880
We've gone from a 2.8 star
rating in the Play store

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:14.365
to a 4.1.

00:02:14.365 --> 00:02:15.990
HENRIQUE MARASSI:
The future of the app

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:17.910
is constantly
evolving and changing

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:20.660
to really make the
life of our users

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:23.110
easier in that home
buying process.

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:24.890
And has been really
big year for us,

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:28.410
and we can't wait to see what
the Android platform will

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:30.170
give us next.
