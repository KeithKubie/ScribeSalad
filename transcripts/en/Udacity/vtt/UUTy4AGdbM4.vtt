00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Well, the key to this problem is breaking it into parts.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
This question really has two parts the way I see it.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
First we have an energy part.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:13.000
When I squeeze the spring, I'm adding elastic potential energy into our system.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
When I let this go and release it,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
that elastic potential energy is being converted to kinetic energy.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:25.000
From that I should be able to find the velocity at which the mass leaves the table.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
How do I do that? 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
I see that all of the potential energy--and this is the potential energy in a spring--

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
all gets converted to kinetic energy.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
Solving out the algebra, which I've done in a few steps here,

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
tells me that the velocity with which it leaves the spring and therefore leaves the table

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
is equal to x * √(k / m).

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:52.000
Plugging in our values: x is 0.25 cm, remember--not meters--times √350/1.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
But over 1 doesn't change anything, so a √350.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.000
This gives me a velocity of 5.68 m/s.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
Okay. Phase one of the problem is done.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.000
Now we can just think of this problem as a block being thrown horizontally

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
with a velocity of 4.68 m/s.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:14.000
Now we use our standard 2-dimensional motion skills to solve this.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
First I want to calculate the time spend in the air.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:21.000
Since there's no vertical velocity initially, my equation of motion simplifies to this.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
There's no v₀t term this time.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
I know Δy is equal to h, so manipulating this around--

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:32.000
moving the 2 up, dividing by g--I find t² is equal to 2h/g,

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.000
which means the time the object spends in the air is just the square root of that--

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:45.000
2h--h is 2 meters, so 2 * 2 is 4 over g, which is 10, gives me a time of 0.63 sec.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000
Now, well, I'm almost done.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.000
We know that vertical and horizontal motion are independent in free fall.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:59.000
We're moving at this constant velocity of 4.68 m/s horizontally for 0.63 sec.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:04.000
So, d is just equal to this v₀ₓ now, the initial velocity in the x direction,

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000
times this time, and when I plug in this numbers,

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:12.000
I get a distance of 2.96 or we'll just round it to 3 m.
