00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
[Evans] The answer is the third choice.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.000
These data structures are getting complicated enough that they're fairly hard to read.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:12.000
We need to think about what components we need to represent the hash table.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
The main component we need is a way of representing a bucket.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
So here's our picture of our hash table.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
What we want is a list.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
This is going to be the list where each element in the list is a bucket.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:29.000
And what a bucket is is a list itself where each element in that list is a key and a value.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000
In our case, the key is the word, the value is the list of URLs.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.000
So the structure that corresponds to that most closely is this one

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
where we have a list, each inner list here.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
So this corresponds to a bucket,

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:48.000
and then within the bucket a word and a list of URLs is 1 entry.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000
This corresponds to what the entries were in our previous index,

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
but now because we want to make it a hash table, we're going to collect them in buckets.

00:00:55.000 --> 99:59:59.000
So a list of those entries and each element in the outer list corresponds to 1 bucket.
