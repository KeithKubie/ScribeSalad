oh

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:14.549
How complaining affects the Brain and General health?

00:00:15.309 --> 00:00:20.159
While we may think it feels good to vent complaining has some bad effects associated with it

00:00:21.279 --> 00:00:28.889
First of all what aspects of life make people want to complain in the aftermath of the recent presidential election

00:00:29.199 --> 00:00:32.369
Many people are grumbling regardless of their political persuasion

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:40.529
Cold temperatures due to winters ice and snow also rank highly on the list of things that displease people, yet these are only the beginning

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:48.330
Many of us have Fallen into the habit of making complaints about everything from bad hair days to troubling relationships

00:00:48.699 --> 00:00:54.599
Even when life is going well we often overlook the positive and fuss about one thorn among the roses

00:00:56.140 --> 00:01:01.739
Why isn't complaining beneficial? Research shows that it rewires our brain for negativity?

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:04.500
The Brain is designed to work efficiently

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:12.629
meaning that when we repeat a thought, negative or positive, the nerve cells form a bridge between each other to expedite the passage of

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:14.020
information

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:18.390
Consequently the next time we have a similar thought it is more easily transmitted

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:23.980
This Mechanism explains why certain thought patterns quickly become ingrained habits

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:27.720
Yet the detrimental effects don't stop there.

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:36.180
A study from Stanford University shows that complaining causes the hippocampus, which plays a vital role in problem-solving and other cognitive

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:38.480
functions, to shrink

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:44.480
In addition to causing brain damage complaining also releases a stress hormone:

00:01:45.159 --> 00:01:52.049
Cortisol, the fight-or-flight chemical the body produces when we encounter some danger, a response that it's essential for survival

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:54.220
however

00:01:54.220 --> 00:02:02.010
constantly having a high level of cortisol results in high blood pressure, high blood sugar, and impaired immunity effects that may eventually cause

00:02:02.229 --> 00:02:04.229
Obesity, diabetes and

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:06.570
cardiovascular disease

00:02:07.629 --> 00:02:13.889
The ill effects of our complaining aren't just limited to ourselves though. They also involve those around us.

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:20.850
People tend to mirror the moods of those around them so we should be cautious about constantly complaining when we're around our friends.

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:26.350
The best way to deal with constant negativity is to develop a sense of gratitude.

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:30.849
Just like complaining acts as a poison, gratitude acts as a medicine

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:38.770
Research shows that having gratitude lowers Cortisol levels by 23% as well as reduces blood pressure and cholesterol

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:41.560
It also decreases fatigue and depression

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:49.090
Gratitude is the perfect antidote for complaining, a behavior that steals our brain power happiness and physical well-being

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:56.018
So what have you observed about the effects of complaining in your own life or in the lives of others?
