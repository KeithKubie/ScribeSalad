1
00:00:01.360 --> 00:00:02.580
You could, you could be like this, you know,

2
00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:05.460
like we just had a show about blessing. You know, I spend the holiday times.

3
00:00:05.461 --> 00:00:06.720
I've been thinking about that. Nope,

4
00:00:07.090 --> 00:00:08.800
<v 1>it's true. Actually, you know, it's been snowing.</v>

5
00:00:08.890 --> 00:00:12.010
It W I was in St Louis just a couple of days ago and it was snowing,

6
00:00:12.011 --> 00:00:12.844
these big fat,

7
00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:16.120
fluffy flakes and I couldn't help but think some of those flakes must be

8
00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:21.510
perfectly shaped crystalline structures right out of cave except there wouldn't

9
00:00:23.051 --> 00:00:24.250
snow in his case. I don't know.

10
00:00:24.251 --> 00:00:29.251
I don't understand this yearning for the perfect when you've got real pretty

11
00:00:29.681 --> 00:00:32.830
great snowflakes falling right on your nose. Like why don't you hold on,

12
00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:37.510
let's just start it up. I'm Jad Abumrad I'm Robert Krulwich, Radiolab,

13
00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:40.990
the podcast and today we're going to continue the conversation we were just

14
00:00:40.991 --> 00:00:45.790
having, we've been having all week about, uh, well perfection, you know,

15
00:00:45.791 --> 00:00:49.780
like striving for things which seem perfect versus living in the real world.

16
00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:54.480
And uh, recently I got into a bit of a kerfuffle with a guy who,

17
00:00:54.481 --> 00:00:57.310
who yearns like you do for an id. This,

18
00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:02.860
his name is Jim Hall, and he wrote this really good book called,

19
00:01:02.861 --> 00:01:04.740
why does the World Exist?

20
00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:10.690
<v 0>And just to get us started in that book, he quotes a poem. Yeah.</v>

21
00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:14.640
Remember the line? Ah, yeah. Kick kick at the rock. Sam Johnson.

22
00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:18.900
Break your bones. But cloudy. Cloudy is the stuff of stones cloudy.

23
00:01:18.901 --> 00:01:23.850
Cloudy is the stuff of stone. Meaning what? It's something. Well, uh, uh,

24
00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:27.820
uh, Samuel Johnson, who lived in the 18th century, uh,

25
00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:31.230
it was a contemporary of Bishop Barclay and Bishop Barclay was an idealist.

26
00:01:31.231 --> 00:01:34.710
He believed that the world was essentially pure appearance.

27
00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:36.990
It was like a thought, not like a solid reality.

28
00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:38.310
It was a thought in the mind of God.

29
00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:43.740
Like the rock really had no substance. And Samuel Johnson, when he heard this,

30
00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:48.210
he thought it was ridiculous and he went and kicked a stone and said,

31
00:01:48.211 --> 00:01:52.260
I refute Barclay. Thus, um, anyway, that's the story.

32
00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:55.710
<v 1>Wait, willing. I thought it was a thought. The other guy thought the rock was a,</v>

33
00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:59.160
what are they arguing about exactly where all they're arguing about reality?

34
00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:03.860
<v 0>Just what is the, this world, what is its, you know, essential. Uh, uh, nature.</v>

35
00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:08.090
<v 1>When you hold a rock in your hand, like what's it made of? What's it made of?</v>

36
00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:11.960
Yeah. Uh, minerals. No,

37
00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:16.250
is that the asking is what is the most essential nature of the rock?

38
00:02:16.251 --> 00:02:18.500
So if you look deep, deep, deep down into the Rock,

39
00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:20.120
do you find something concrete?

40
00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:24.140
Do you find a little bit of thing or where do you find something more if

41
00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:28.250
furious? Something you can't touch, something you can't pin down something like,

42
00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:33.020
oh, a thought. This is Jim's notes.

43
00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:36.690
<v 0>Now this sounds like a, it sounds like I'd been eating Lotus sleeves too,</v>

44
00:02:36.691 --> 00:02:38.010
but I mean it's, it's a pipe dream,

45
00:02:38.011 --> 00:02:41.160
but this is what science has increasingly led us to

46
00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:45.200
<v 1>that rocks or thoughts? Well, to follow Jim's logic,</v>

47
00:02:45.201 --> 00:02:49.070
he goes all the way back to the Greeks to the first real attempt to get to

48
00:02:49.071 --> 00:02:50.810
what's really at the bottom of Iraq.

49
00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:52.100
<v 0>You know, even in ancient times,</v>

50
00:02:52.101 --> 00:02:56.840
the atomised Democritus and loose IPUs thought that if you keep cutting up the

51
00:02:56.841 --> 00:03:00.940
stuff of reality that we see around us, tables, chairs and rocks and so forth,

52
00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:02.260
eventually you,

53
00:03:02.261 --> 00:03:06.070
you cut them up into such itty bitty pieces that you can't cut any further.

54
00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:09.250
And then you've got Adam's. So there you've got,

55
00:03:09.251 --> 00:03:13.030
you've clearly got a fundamental stuff, the Adams study, are you pleased?

56
00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:15.790
But I'm even going back to Newton.

57
00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:20.560
There were reasons to suspect that there was something a little funny about

58
00:03:20.561 --> 00:03:24.010
reality. It wasn't quite as substantial as we believed.

59
00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:25.820
<v 2>Okay?</v>

60
00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:28.670
<v 0>No. Newton of course, came up with a theory of gravity.</v>

61
00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:32.240
And the theory of gravity says, if you've got the sun and a planet,

62
00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:35.970
the sun exerts a gravitational force on the planet. Okay.

63
00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:39.350
And Newton's contemporaries wanted to know, well, how does it do that?

64
00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:43.550
What is the mechanism that by which gravity is mediated, how does the sun,

65
00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:46.430
as it were recharged to the earth and,

66
00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:48.590
and force it to move around to this orbit?

67
00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:54.030
So if I were an Atha mist, if I were looking for stuff,

68
00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:58.840
then I'd need some kind of thing that carried gravity. Yeah. Yeah.

69
00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:01.600
But the problem is it looks like there's nothing between the earth and the sun

70
00:04:01.601 --> 00:04:02.620
except a void.

71
00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:08.850
All the Newton had to fill that void was a mathematical equation that told them

72
00:04:09.131 --> 00:04:12.460
how the sun and the earth interact. And the thing is, it worked.

73
00:04:12.461 --> 00:04:15.490
You could plug in the numbers and you could know how one was influencing the

74
00:04:15.491 --> 00:04:19.930
other, but Newton had no idea at all why the equation work.

75
00:04:19.931 --> 00:04:24.360
He couldn't point to any like a little particle thing, like a graviton as it.

76
00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:25.263
There's your reason.

77
00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:30.270
It almost seemed like gravity was created from the equation itself and this

78
00:04:31.331 --> 00:04:35.790
disturbed a lot of people because at that time everybody thought that nature has

79
00:04:35.791 --> 00:04:40.530
to meet, be made out of hard, durable stuff, you know, years,

80
00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:43.440
sprockets, pushing and pulling. That's the essence of reality.

81
00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:49.170
Then in the 20th century, of course it got much, much worse. You know, the,

82
00:04:49.171 --> 00:04:51.450
the Adam, which was thought to be very,

83
00:04:51.451 --> 00:04:54.540
very tiny and you couldn't cut it any further. It was the limit to this,

84
00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:55.760
you know, splitting process. Right.

85
00:04:55.950 --> 00:05:00.380
And as we know all too well from the 20th century, you can split it at and yeah,

86
00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:02.070
it has pretty interesting consequences.

87
00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:07.350
But we also discovered the Adam is almost entirely empty space, Huh?

88
00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:08.640
It's,

89
00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:13.640
it's if you took a baseball and put it in the middle of Madison Square Garden,

90
00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:16.540
that would be like the nucleus and the the, you know,

91
00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:20.280
the first level of electrons or as far away as the exterior of the garden.

92
00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:25.620
So you can think of this baseball, this nucleus as a tiny God all alone.

93
00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:30.090
So it's basically the Adam is a big empty space. Well it doesn't feel that way.

94
00:05:30.091 --> 00:05:31.500
Like watch this, I'm going to do this.

95
00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:39.600
If my hands are all Adams and as you say, atoms are mostly empty space,

96
00:05:39.601 --> 00:05:43.140
then why don't my hands just go right to each other like two clouds.

97
00:05:43.141 --> 00:05:46.840
But you'll notice. Yeah, why don't I fall through the floor here?

98
00:05:46.841 --> 00:05:50.620
Because the floor is mostly empty space and I'm mostly empty space. That too.

99
00:05:50.621 --> 00:05:52.990
If you look at it in the micro level, this appearance,

100
00:05:52.991 --> 00:05:57.040
solidity is the product of a purely mathematical,

101
00:05:58.650 --> 00:06:03.470
isn't it more like my electrons don't like similar electron.

102
00:06:03.471 --> 00:06:06.380
So the electrons in my hands just hate the electrons. On the other hand,

103
00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:10.390
it basically comes down to a pair of mathematical relations that the,

104
00:06:10.391 --> 00:06:13.790
the Paoli exclusion principle and the Heisenberg uncertainty principle.

105
00:06:14.090 --> 00:06:16.050
I mean all of this, this gets very abstract, right?

106
00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:17.760
I understand it perfectly of questions.

107
00:06:17.780 --> 00:06:20.560
I don't want to bore you with the details of his,

108
00:06:20.570 --> 00:06:23.500
like you have no idea what he's saying. Well,

109
00:06:23.990 --> 00:06:25.970
I'll say this according to Jim,

110
00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:30.290
it's not that the electrons in my left hand are repelling the electrons in my

111
00:06:30.291 --> 00:06:34.610
right hand. It has to do with a law of nature. The says two particles,

112
00:06:34.820 --> 00:06:38.300
identical particles can not be in the same place at the same time.

113
00:06:38.420 --> 00:06:39.890
So when you hear that sound,

114
00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:44.660
you can hear it as the sound of a law saying no, not allowed.

115
00:06:44.810 --> 00:06:49.670
Not In nature. Exactly. And here's, here's a, a, um,

116
00:06:50.230 --> 00:06:52.130
so slightly different way of putting that, but wait,

117
00:06:52.131 --> 00:06:56.450
isn't this law that we are announcing? Isn't this law about, uh,

118
00:06:56.720 --> 00:07:00.480
particles like we're talking about atoms and electrons. Those are things.

119
00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:04.850
So we're still, we're still talking about things. Well, uh, if you,

120
00:07:04.851 --> 00:07:07.220
if you study quantum field theory,

121
00:07:07.340 --> 00:07:11.540
which is what all physics graduate students at begin with in graduate school,

122
00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:13.820
you discover the, even particles are unreal.

123
00:07:16.840 --> 00:07:20.900
They're just temporary properties of what are called fields and fields are just

124
00:07:21.140 --> 00:07:24.590
distributions of mathematical quantities through space time.

125
00:07:25.310 --> 00:07:28.790
So they're not, they don't seem to be grounded in anything.

126
00:07:29.630 --> 00:07:33.590
<v 1>According to Jim, a field is kinda like a stream of numbers,</v>

127
00:07:33.800 --> 00:07:36.980
pure information numbers that tell you where a particle,

128
00:07:36.981 --> 00:07:38.510
like an electron might be.

129
00:07:38.511 --> 00:07:41.690
So maybe the blood trends over here or maybe it's over there or maybe it's with

130
00:07:42.060 --> 00:07:42.870
dispute. Maybe it's with Vac.

131
00:07:42.870 --> 00:07:47.660
The problem is you can't ever see the thing itself. You can only see it

132
00:07:47.680 --> 00:07:49.930
<v 0>the effect it has on other things.</v>

133
00:07:50.380 --> 00:07:53.110
So you can't observe it.

134
00:07:53.230 --> 00:07:57.790
And if something is in principle unobservable you may as well say it doesn't

135
00:07:57.791 --> 00:07:58.624
exist.

136
00:07:58.970 --> 00:08:03.410
<v 1>Wait a second. No, I know what I mean. I'm on his side.</v>

137
00:08:03.411 --> 00:08:06.050
But you could say that it's just not observable down there.

138
00:08:06.051 --> 00:08:10.400
At the microscale up here. It's pretty observable. I mean, this table exists,

139
00:08:10.820 --> 00:08:14.340
this mixer, I mean, something is happening to give the world substance will,

140
00:08:14.360 --> 00:08:16.840
according to Jim, we think happens in this,

141
00:08:16.841 --> 00:08:19.810
I admittedly is eight in a gross over simplification.

142
00:08:19.840 --> 00:08:24.340
But in these fields you're going to get these little fluctuations,

143
00:08:25.090 --> 00:08:30.010
these little events, certain hiccups of energy, cool bursts,

144
00:08:30.250 --> 00:08:33.910
and that's where stuffiness flickers into existence.

145
00:08:34.490 --> 00:08:39.170
<v 0>But it's a very flickering existence. Stuff isn't permanent.</v>

146
00:08:39.200 --> 00:08:43.730
So what is a rock? I mean a rock looks like a good solid persisting object,

147
00:08:43.731 --> 00:08:48.350
but it's really our perception of it is energy transitions,

148
00:08:48.351 --> 00:08:50.810
changes in the distribution of energy from one state to another.

149
00:08:50.811 --> 00:08:55.680
When that happens, the energy is irradiated. It goes through my retina,

150
00:08:56.450 --> 00:09:00.120
[inaudible] pupil rather and strikes my retina and I perceive the rock.

151
00:09:01.140 --> 00:09:02.970
So going back to that poem we started with,

152
00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:07.470
I dunno if Jim would call a rock like Bishop Barclay did a thought in the mind

153
00:09:07.530 --> 00:09:07.981
of God.

154
00:09:07.981 --> 00:09:12.981
But you might say that deep down what a rock is is an expression of rules or

155
00:09:13.980 --> 00:09:18.030
math. It's just here like a shadow of an idea. Yeah.

156
00:09:18.780 --> 00:09:19.613
Yeah.

157
00:09:20.040 --> 00:09:20.380
<v 3>Okay.</v>

158
00:09:20.380 --> 00:09:24.160
<v 0>I've heard one physicists say that the cosmos is ultimately a concept.</v>

159
00:09:25.190 --> 00:09:25.590
<v 3>No.</v>

160
00:09:25.590 --> 00:09:28.920
<v 0>Are you increasingly convinced that the reason you can clap,</v>

161
00:09:28.921 --> 00:09:30.870
the reason you don't fall through the floor?

162
00:09:31.380 --> 00:09:36.380
The reason that gravity works is all because of certain ideas that govern ideas.

163
00:09:38.251 --> 00:09:40.740
Rule the world. Yeah. Yeah. Maybe, you know,

164
00:09:40.850 --> 00:09:44.550
at a hundred years from now when a string theory is finally worked out,

165
00:09:44.551 --> 00:09:46.860
we might have a very different conception of it, but it would,

166
00:09:46.861 --> 00:09:51.150
it looks as though it's going to be mathematics and structure all the way down.

167
00:09:51.480 --> 00:09:55.710
You're okay with this? Well, I'm a sort of mathematical romantic.

168
00:09:55.711 --> 00:09:59.910
I love the idea that the essence of reality is not stuff.

169
00:09:59.970 --> 00:10:03.000
You know who the stuff is kind of ugly and you want to get rid of stuff.

170
00:10:03.001 --> 00:10:05.800
There's too much stuff in your apartment flutter. It's

171
00:10:08.420 --> 00:10:09.840
[inaudible]. I don't have style that, you know,

172
00:10:09.841 --> 00:10:11.580
this is the temperamental difference between us.

173
00:10:11.640 --> 00:10:14.580
I like the idea that reality consists, it's a,

174
00:10:14.581 --> 00:10:18.330
it's a flux of pure information with no further substance.

175
00:10:18.360 --> 00:10:21.630
I don't know why this makes you so happy. I mean here I,

176
00:10:21.900 --> 00:10:25.830
I would love if I clapping or if I'm hitting someone in the face.

177
00:10:26.100 --> 00:10:30.210
I would love to think the billiard ball of me is hitting the billiard ball of

178
00:10:30.211 --> 00:10:31.950
them. And that explains what's going on.

179
00:10:32.220 --> 00:10:35.130
Now you've offered living in an almost in a spiritual realm.

180
00:10:35.131 --> 00:10:38.580
You want to live in this, in this gross material realm.

181
00:10:38.850 --> 00:10:43.140
And where there's a lot of turns out we're, we're chewable realm.

182
00:10:43.170 --> 00:10:45.050
It's literally empty. It's like,

183
00:10:45.340 --> 00:10:49.660
it's it so intuitively wrong that if you go back to the old, you know,

184
00:10:49.720 --> 00:10:54.540
19th century view that we're made up of these little hard particle Adams that

185
00:10:54.541 --> 00:10:55.470
are all bumping around.

186
00:10:55.950 --> 00:11:00.950
Is it any more plausible that you and I are just a bunch of dumb hard particles

187
00:11:03.031 --> 00:11:07.300
in a certain configuration? And if that's true, you know how,

188
00:11:07.430 --> 00:11:11.520
how are certain configurations of these particles Tan them out to the horrible

189
00:11:11.521 --> 00:11:12.420
feeling of pain?

190
00:11:13.740 --> 00:11:17.640
You could say pain all that's just a lot of elementary particles in a certain

191
00:11:17.641 --> 00:11:20.730
configuration, but we all know that explanation isn't enough.

192
00:11:20.820 --> 00:11:23.100
So when you look down to the bottom of everything,

193
00:11:23.430 --> 00:11:27.360
whether it's a mathematical object or whether it's little billiard balls

194
00:11:27.361 --> 00:11:30.210
knocking around there, it's still

195
00:11:32.350 --> 00:11:36.750
vernaculars and [inaudible] it probable that it should produce subjective

196
00:11:36.751 --> 00:11:38.940
experience that it should produce, you know,

197
00:11:39.070 --> 00:11:42.090
pleasure and pain and that mystery,

198
00:11:42.091 --> 00:11:47.091
how you go from the most basic things are actually the most basic nothings to

199
00:11:47.760 --> 00:11:52.230
everything we see around us. I find that to be exhilarating,

200
00:11:52.500 --> 00:11:53.500
to worry about that, you know,

201
00:11:53.501 --> 00:11:56.170
the metaphysics of physics and the nature of reality,

202
00:11:56.560 --> 00:12:00.370
even though it doesn't lead you to any sort of comfortable intellectual closure,

203
00:12:01.270 --> 00:12:01.871
um, it makes for,

204
00:12:01.871 --> 00:12:05.410
it's a good way of idling away and otherwise boring afternoon is we've just

205
00:12:05.411 --> 00:12:10.270
proved. It also explains why when I hid better to him with my,

206
00:12:10.300 --> 00:12:14.500
with my very strong for him, he seemed to think of it as a fascinating thought.

207
00:12:18.350 --> 00:12:20.250
<v 3>Now let's stop it.</v>

208
00:12:27.090 --> 00:12:28.980
<v 0>Special thanks to Jim Holt,</v>

209
00:12:28.981 --> 00:12:32.970
who actually we were both too shy to ever head but each other in two weeks to

210
00:12:33.100 --> 00:12:36.000
try it anyway. He's, he has a wonder. The book is called,

211
00:12:36.001 --> 00:12:39.630
why does the World Exist? An existential detective story.

212
00:12:43.170 --> 00:12:46.230
Okay. Well, I guess that's it for this podcast. A happy new year. Everybody.

213
00:12:46.231 --> 00:12:49.020
I'm Chad Apple. I'm Rod. I'm Robert Krulwich. Thanks for listening.
