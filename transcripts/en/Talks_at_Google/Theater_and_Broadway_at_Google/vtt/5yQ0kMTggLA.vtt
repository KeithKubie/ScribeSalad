00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:07.340
This is hopefully one of many
performances of Broadway at

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:09.200

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:09.530
Thank you.

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:11.780
We are fortunate enough to

ALAN SEALES: Yay!

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:24.100
So we are ready to get started
with two numbers, and then

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:27.200
we're going to go into Q&amp;A. And
there'll be microphones

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:28.430

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:29.910
So this is being recorded.

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:30.940
Make sure you use the

00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:32.090
microphones for your questions.

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:34.630
We'll give you swag to reward
you, and it'll be fun.

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:36.220
And that'll be that.

He is the president and

Rodgers &amp; Hammerstein,
an Imagem Company.

00:11:38.810 --> 00:11:40.560

You guys don't know that,
but I called it out.

SANTINO FONTANA: It's fine.

ALAN SEALES: Good.

00:12:14.590 --> 00:12:18.600
So I guess let's start at the
very beginning, a very good

00:12:18.600 --> 00:12:19.160
place to start.

00:12:19.160 --> 00:12:19.403
LAURA OSNES: [SINGING]

00:12:19.403 --> 00:12:20.738
A very good place to start.

00:12:20.738 --> 00:12:21.988
ALAN SEALES: Thank you.

00:12:23.990 --> 00:12:27.190
So, "Cinderella," of course, was
commissioned by CBS to be

00:12:27.190 --> 00:12:31.070
produced for TV back in
1957, broadcast live

00:12:31.070 --> 00:12:34.480
on March 31, 1957.

00:12:34.480 --> 00:12:37.810
Surrounding all of that, there's
a lot of reasoning, I

00:12:37.810 --> 00:12:41.170
guess, why it was brought back
or what brought it to Broadway

00:12:41.170 --> 00:12:43.370
in the first place.

00:12:43.370 --> 00:12:47.360
So Ted, you were kind of the
inspiration behind getting it

00:12:47.360 --> 00:12:49.732
from there to here.

00:12:49.732 --> 00:12:51.470
TED CHAPIN: Well, do we just--

00:12:51.470 --> 00:12:54.130
ALAN SEALES: No, we're
recording, so we need a mic.

00:12:54.130 --> 00:12:56.240
Yeah, let's get a
mic down here.

00:12:56.240 --> 00:12:58.190
TED CHAPIN: I mean, part
of the fun of my job--

00:12:58.190 --> 00:13:02.470
aside from hearing spontaneous
performances of songs from

00:13:02.470 --> 00:13:04.560
other Rodgers &amp; Hammerstein
shows, like "start at the very

00:13:04.560 --> 00:13:05.810
beginning"--

00:13:07.530 --> 00:13:09.960
the Rodgers &amp; Hammerstein
catalog is an extraordinary

00:13:09.960 --> 00:13:13.080
collection of musicals, as
you, I hope, all know.

00:13:13.080 --> 00:13:17.250
But there's always a creative
side that you never can tell

00:13:17.250 --> 00:13:19.740
where it's going to
happen and how.

00:13:19.740 --> 00:13:23.460
One of the lead producers of
"Cinderella" is Robyn Goodman,

00:13:23.460 --> 00:13:25.650
and she and I happened to be
on a trip that a Broadway

00:13:25.650 --> 00:13:29.080
producer named Manny Azenberg
does to Israel every year.

00:13:29.080 --> 00:13:32.160
And it's basically a trip for
people, wisenheimers who work

00:13:32.160 --> 00:13:35.340
in the theater to see this part
of the world, just to see

00:13:35.340 --> 00:13:36.080
this part of the world.

00:13:36.080 --> 00:13:38.480
And since my mother's family
came over on the "Mayflower,"

00:13:38.480 --> 00:13:40.480
I kept saying to Manny,
why are you asking

00:13:40.480 --> 00:13:41.290
me about this trip?

00:13:41.290 --> 00:13:42.690
It doesn't make any sense.

00:13:42.690 --> 00:13:44.450
So the only way to shut
him up was to go.

00:13:44.450 --> 00:13:46.960
So I went on a trip about five
years ago, and Robyn Goodman

00:13:46.960 --> 00:13:48.900
was on the trip, and
we just hit it off.

00:13:48.900 --> 00:13:50.890
And she said to me at one point,
gee, we're having such

00:13:50.890 --> 00:13:51.440
a good time together.

00:13:51.440 --> 00:13:53.260
Is there something
we could work on?

00:13:53.260 --> 00:13:56.390
And I said, you know, no one's
ever actually thought about or

00:13:56.390 --> 00:13:59.670
figured out how to take the
television version of

00:13:59.670 --> 00:14:02.490
"Cinderella" that Rodgers &amp;
Hammerstein wrote and adapt it

00:14:02.490 --> 00:14:05.030
to a Broadway show.

00:14:05.030 --> 00:14:06.390
So what about that?

00:14:06.390 --> 00:14:08.430
And she started to think, oh,
wouldn't it be great to make a

00:14:08.430 --> 00:14:12.480
modern Cinderella who stands up
for herself a little more?

00:14:12.480 --> 00:14:14.200
So basically, that's
where it started.

00:14:14.200 --> 00:14:17.730
And just over the years,
just one good idea

00:14:17.730 --> 00:14:19.080
after another happened.

00:14:19.080 --> 00:14:23.720
And so here we are with all of
these people doing incredible

00:14:23.720 --> 00:14:25.630
honor to this show.

00:14:25.630 --> 00:14:26.070
ALAN SEALES: Nice.

00:14:26.070 --> 00:14:32.330
So talk about, I guess, from
the audition side of things

00:14:32.330 --> 00:14:34.820
from the very beginning,
I guess--

00:14:34.820 --> 00:14:38.510
and I'm not making
the pun again.

00:14:38.510 --> 00:14:41.000
You start with a script, and
you go through revisions.

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:46.680
And you need to find a
bookwriter, and you go through

00:14:46.680 --> 00:14:49.360
table readings and find
people to do so.

00:14:49.360 --> 00:14:51.760
And how did you find
these people?

00:14:51.760 --> 00:14:54.030
TED CHAPIN: Well, in the good
old days of Broadway, you

00:14:54.030 --> 00:14:56.800
would write a script and take
it out of town and do it in

00:14:56.800 --> 00:14:58.720
Boston or Philadelphia or
Washington or a couple of

00:14:58.720 --> 00:15:02.020
those places and listen to those
audiences and make the

00:15:02.020 --> 00:15:03.910
adjustments and then
come into town.

00:15:03.910 --> 00:15:07.500
That's pretty prohibitively
expensive these days.

00:15:07.500 --> 00:15:10.980
So the thing that Robyn and
her compadre Jill Furman,

00:15:10.980 --> 00:15:13.760
who's here, were very smart
about is starting with a very

00:15:13.760 --> 00:15:15.000
simple reading.

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:16.670
There are all these
things available--

00:15:16.670 --> 00:15:18.310
readings, workshops--

00:15:18.310 --> 00:15:22.590
and they kind of used every
version of it to get the

00:15:22.590 --> 00:15:24.840
project to the next step.

00:15:24.840 --> 00:15:27.340
The very first reading, which
is very informal, and

00:15:27.340 --> 00:15:29.340
Laura was in it.

00:15:29.340 --> 00:15:31.795
And I remember my comment
about it.

00:15:31.795 --> 00:15:34.210
It was very funny and very
good, but they didn't, I

00:15:34.210 --> 00:15:36.510
think, pay enough attention
to the music.

00:15:36.510 --> 00:15:41.890
So I just said to Robyn, you
can't really do this without

00:15:41.890 --> 00:15:45.020
paying attention to both the
music that exists and whatever

00:15:45.020 --> 00:15:46.260
new music's going to
be put in there.

00:15:46.260 --> 00:15:49.640
Because if it's somebody like
Douglas Carter Beane, who has

00:15:49.640 --> 00:15:55.700
a very modern, edgy sense of
humor and sensibility, if

00:15:55.700 --> 00:15:58.530
that's going to match with the
kind of romance of what

00:15:58.530 --> 00:16:00.170
Rodgers &amp; Hammerstein
wrote, that's

00:16:00.170 --> 00:16:01.340
going to be very tricky.

00:16:01.340 --> 00:16:03.160
And I think that was the
biggest challenge.

00:16:03.160 --> 00:16:07.950
And I have to say that this team
really honed that right

00:16:07.950 --> 00:16:12.460
up to opening night, how to make
certain that the humor is

00:16:12.460 --> 00:16:16.090
right for the songs and the
songs come out of the story.

00:16:16.090 --> 00:16:19.120
And I have to say of all the
shows I've worked on in my

00:16:19.120 --> 00:16:21.580
days at R&amp;H, this was
among the more,

00:16:21.580 --> 00:16:24.690
first of all, joyous.

00:16:24.690 --> 00:16:25.830
Sure, there were the
ups and downs.

00:16:25.830 --> 00:16:26.660
There always are.

00:16:26.660 --> 00:16:29.560
But it was a really, really
joyous, positive experience.

00:16:29.560 --> 00:16:32.720
And just going backstage,
they're seeming to

00:16:32.720 --> 00:16:33.540
have a very good time.

00:16:33.540 --> 00:16:35.750
Either you're really, really
good actors, or you really are

00:16:35.750 --> 00:16:37.751
having a good time.

00:16:37.751 --> 00:16:40.760
ALAN SEALES: So Laura, you were
involved from the book

00:16:40.760 --> 00:16:42.430
reading at the beginning,
right?

00:16:42.430 --> 00:16:42.830
LAURA OSNES: Yes.

00:16:42.830 --> 00:16:45.280
That one he was talking about
was literally an afternoon

00:16:45.280 --> 00:16:48.810
where we got together and
literally read it out loud one

00:16:48.810 --> 00:16:49.575
time through.

00:16:49.575 --> 00:16:51.070
It was a very quick thing.

00:16:51.070 --> 00:16:53.750
And then it was about six
months of we didn't hear

00:16:53.750 --> 00:16:55.110
anything, or eight months
or whatever it was.

00:16:55.110 --> 00:16:58.170
And then our first reading with
all of these folks was

00:16:58.170 --> 00:17:01.540
January of 2012, so a
year and a half ago.

00:17:01.540 --> 00:17:04.730
And we did a workshop last
summer, a four-week-long

00:17:04.730 --> 00:17:07.650
workshop where we pretty much
staged the whole thing in a

00:17:07.650 --> 00:17:11.000
rehearsal studio with framework
sets and even

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:14.579
choreographed numbers and were
memorized and all of that.

00:17:14.579 --> 00:17:17.740
And then did another reading
last October of 2012, and then

00:17:17.740 --> 00:17:19.069
we started rehearsal
in December.

00:17:19.069 --> 00:17:23.450
So it's been really exciting to
see the changes in the show

00:17:23.450 --> 00:17:24.460
and how it's developed
over time.

00:17:24.460 --> 00:17:26.410
But I have to say, I think the
brunt of the changes came

00:17:26.410 --> 00:17:28.640
during previews on Broadway.

00:17:28.640 --> 00:17:31.160
Even though we had a year to
kind of prepare and shift

00:17:31.160 --> 00:17:34.470
things and make it better and
better, I feel like most of

00:17:34.470 --> 00:17:37.240
the changes happened once we
had a real audience and we

00:17:37.240 --> 00:17:39.560
were getting real feedback
from real people who were

00:17:39.560 --> 00:17:41.100
going to come see the show.

00:17:41.100 --> 00:17:43.540
ALAN SEALES: So for those who
don't know, what are previews?

00:17:43.540 --> 00:17:47.160
LAURA OSNES: Previews is the
month-long period before a

00:17:47.160 --> 00:17:49.400
show officially opens on
Broadway, and every Broadway

00:17:49.400 --> 00:17:52.240
show has as a season
of previews.

00:17:52.240 --> 00:17:54.900
So we had about 41
performances-- it's usually

00:17:54.900 --> 00:17:56.900
about a month long--

00:17:56.900 --> 00:18:00.560
where we're still rehearsing
during the day and performing

00:18:00.560 --> 00:18:01.140
every night.

00:18:01.140 --> 00:18:02.390
SANTINO FONTANA:
It's like beta.

00:18:05.260 --> 00:18:06.730
I know my audience.

00:18:06.730 --> 00:18:07.980
LAURA OSNES: There we go.

00:18:10.810 --> 00:18:14.410
So yeah, we're still making
changes every day.

00:18:14.410 --> 00:18:15.040
We're rehearsing.

00:18:15.040 --> 00:18:16.970
We're getting new script changes
based on how the

00:18:16.970 --> 00:18:18.830
previous night's audience
responded.

00:18:18.830 --> 00:18:22.140
So if jokes aren't getting
laughs three nights in a row,

00:18:22.140 --> 00:18:24.360
maybe that joke gets cut, or
maybe it gets changed.

00:18:24.360 --> 00:18:28.590
Or if a song isn't working,
maybe the song either gets cut

00:18:28.590 --> 00:18:31.230
or shifted or things
like that.

00:18:31.230 --> 00:18:33.840
So during previews, the show
is constantly changing.

00:18:33.840 --> 00:18:36.290
And then just a few days before
previews, we freeze the

00:18:36.290 --> 00:18:38.250
show for opening night.

00:18:38.250 --> 00:18:41.340
And from opening night on,
it's just the same show.

00:18:41.340 --> 00:18:45.940
ALAN SEALES: So, Marla, maybe
you can speak to this.

00:18:45.940 --> 00:18:50.850
Is there anything major that
ever does get cut from shows?

00:18:50.850 --> 00:18:51.980
MARLA MINDELLE: Womp womp.

00:18:51.980 --> 00:18:53.160
ALAN SEALES: Leading question.

00:18:53.160 --> 00:18:55.340
MARLA MINDELLE: Yes.

00:18:55.340 --> 00:18:59.320
My character and another
character, I think, took a lot

00:18:59.320 --> 00:19:02.100
of the brunt of the changes,
because our characters are

00:19:02.100 --> 00:19:04.850
different than the
originally-conceived story as

00:19:04.850 --> 00:19:05.340
we all know.

00:19:05.340 --> 00:19:07.820
There are two evil stepsisters
usually.

00:19:07.820 --> 00:19:09.730
And in this version, I'm
actually very nice and very

00:19:09.730 --> 00:19:11.630
shy, and I have a crush
on somebody else

00:19:11.630 --> 00:19:13.160
who is not the prince.

00:19:13.160 --> 00:19:15.650
He is a revolutionary is
named Jean Michel.

00:19:15.650 --> 00:19:21.020
And so him and I have this plot
B love story going on.

00:19:21.020 --> 00:19:24.920
And we had this lovely little
duet that just wasn't working,

00:19:24.920 --> 00:19:29.230
and so that got cut maybe
two weeks into previews.

00:19:29.230 --> 00:19:32.800
And so, I'm not going to lie,
it was a little bit sad,

00:19:32.800 --> 00:19:36.540
because you work on something
for so long, and it becomes

00:19:36.540 --> 00:19:37.420
second nature.

00:19:37.420 --> 00:19:40.740
And it was a nice little moment,
but in the grand

00:19:40.740 --> 00:19:42.640
scheme of the show, it
just wasn't working.

00:19:42.640 --> 00:19:45.160
So it had to go.

00:19:45.160 --> 00:19:48.860
But for those two weeks, we
had a great time on stage

00:19:48.860 --> 00:19:50.990
together singing and dancing
our little number.

00:19:50.990 --> 00:19:51.080
And

00:19:51.080 --> 00:19:54.620
Also, Harriet, Ann, and I had a
number in the first act that

00:19:54.620 --> 00:19:57.150
was also cut about
two weeks in.

00:19:57.150 --> 00:20:00.120
So yeah, it was tricky.

00:20:00.120 --> 00:20:06.050
But life goes on, and we
still have a good time.

00:20:06.050 --> 00:20:09.070
ALAN SEALES: Incidentally,
let's see what we have

00:20:09.070 --> 00:20:11.020
in the goody bag.

00:20:11.020 --> 00:20:11.710
What's this, programs?

00:20:11.710 --> 00:20:13.630
We've got some programs here.

00:20:13.630 --> 00:20:16.990
These are your incentives for
getting up at the microphones

00:20:16.990 --> 00:20:18.870
and asking questions.

00:20:18.870 --> 00:20:21.460
So we've got some of that.

00:20:21.460 --> 00:20:24.000
And then what else is in here?

00:20:27.740 --> 00:20:31.600
CDs of the score, which is all
these guys singing, which is

00:20:31.600 --> 00:20:32.790
available--

00:20:32.790 --> 00:20:34.830
I wrote it down so I don't
get it wrong--

00:20:34.830 --> 00:20:35.440
on iTunes--

00:20:35.440 --> 00:20:38.750
I can remember that-- and
Ghostlight Records.

00:20:38.750 --> 00:20:39.740
So there you go.

00:20:39.740 --> 00:20:40.390
Ask some questions.

00:20:40.390 --> 00:20:41.640
Get some stuff.

00:20:46.860 --> 00:20:48.950
Harriet, what is it like working
with Ann and Marla?

00:20:51.950 --> 00:20:53.670
I've seen the show, right.

00:20:53.670 --> 00:20:57.640
And typically, like Marla said,
the stepsisters are

00:20:57.640 --> 00:21:02.640
altogether evil and with the
stepmama, and they're always

00:21:02.640 --> 00:21:04.320
trying to do bad things
to everyone.

00:21:04.320 --> 00:21:07.240
But now, it's like Marla's
off on her own thing,

00:21:07.240 --> 00:21:08.060
doing her own thing.

00:21:08.060 --> 00:21:12.210
How do you balance
that on stage?

00:21:12.210 --> 00:21:13.900
HARRIET HARRIS: I think the
mother has goals for these

00:21:13.900 --> 00:21:17.030
girls, so she's unaware to some
extent, like a lot of

00:21:17.030 --> 00:21:18.990
mothers are, that the children
are growing up and

00:21:18.990 --> 00:21:20.120
going their own way.

00:21:20.120 --> 00:21:23.640
And she has a vision for what
would make a better life for

00:21:23.640 --> 00:21:24.610
these girls.

00:21:24.610 --> 00:21:28.500
And in her world, the only
way to have a good life--

00:21:28.500 --> 00:21:30.050
she's not a very
modern woman--

00:21:30.050 --> 00:21:31.980
the only way to have
a good life is to

00:21:31.980 --> 00:21:33.390
marry a man with money.

00:21:33.390 --> 00:21:37.550
And in that world in which she
grew up, that's how you do it.

00:21:37.550 --> 00:21:41.250
And she doesn't see how her
girls can live without that.

00:21:41.250 --> 00:21:45.850
I think she feels either Marla
is the eldest and should marry

00:21:45.850 --> 00:21:48.230
first, because that's the
way it used to be.

00:21:48.230 --> 00:21:53.240
Or maybe perhaps she knows
what the prince likes, so

00:21:53.240 --> 00:21:55.340
she's going to push Marla.

00:21:55.340 --> 00:21:58.230
If Ann were the one that the
prince would like, I'd push

00:21:58.230 --> 00:22:02.530
Ann in hopes that then Marla
would get a good husband.

00:22:02.530 --> 00:22:04.270
But it's all about
that for her.

00:22:04.270 --> 00:22:08.450
So she doesn't see that there's
a romance developing

00:22:08.450 --> 00:22:12.020
with a very young, poor
revolutionary, because who

00:22:12.020 --> 00:22:15.200
would choose that, frankly?

00:22:15.200 --> 00:22:18.030
So in her world, who
would do that?

00:22:18.030 --> 00:22:19.730
So I think that's a lot of it.

00:22:19.730 --> 00:22:22.510
There's a blind spot that she
has about her kids in

00:22:22.510 --> 00:22:25.120
assuming, like a lot of parents
do, you will to join

00:22:25.120 --> 00:22:25.880
the family business.

00:22:25.880 --> 00:22:27.510
You will want to live
the life I've lived.

00:22:27.510 --> 00:22:30.630
You will learn by
my experience.

00:22:30.630 --> 00:22:36.080
The song that we had that was
cut was about "learn from my

00:22:36.080 --> 00:22:38.670
experience." I married
for love.

00:22:38.670 --> 00:22:40.290
It doesn't work out.

00:22:40.290 --> 00:22:41.640
You need stability.

00:22:41.640 --> 00:22:44.300
You need this, and the way
to get it in this world

00:22:44.300 --> 00:22:45.740
is you get a man.

00:22:45.740 --> 00:22:52.480
So that's what her goals are
for the daughters, and it's

00:22:52.480 --> 00:22:54.860
fun to work with the two.

00:22:54.860 --> 00:22:57.210
As actresses, they're really
fun to work with.

00:22:57.210 --> 00:22:58.310
MARLA MINDELLE: We're
just divas.

00:22:58.310 --> 00:22:59.080
Just three divas.

00:22:59.080 --> 00:23:00.050
HARRIET HARRIS: They're
really adorable.

00:23:00.050 --> 00:23:01.670
LAURA OSNES: We've been around
either so much that we

00:23:01.670 --> 00:23:02.740
coordinating our outfits.

00:23:02.740 --> 00:23:04.310
Without even calling
each other, we

00:23:04.310 --> 00:23:07.690
all showed up matching.

00:23:07.690 --> 00:23:09.700
HARRIET HARRIS: And Laura too.

00:23:09.700 --> 00:23:13.110
Because we're almost always
all together, it's a very

00:23:13.110 --> 00:23:14.860
peculiar little family
dynamic.

00:23:14.860 --> 00:23:19.860
And we're always adversarial,
even if people are maybe

00:23:19.860 --> 00:23:23.330
passively supportive of Laura
in the household.

00:23:23.330 --> 00:23:29.290
She's the brunt of so many
things and of so much bad

00:23:29.290 --> 00:23:31.510
behavior on my part, anyway.

00:23:34.262 --> 00:23:37.950
But it's wonderfully strung
together, and it is different

00:23:37.950 --> 00:23:40.640
than just the normal
"Cinderella."

00:23:40.640 --> 00:23:42.520
ALAN SEALES: So, Santino,
do feel left out?

00:23:42.520 --> 00:23:44.223
Are you lonely?

00:23:44.223 --> 00:23:44.656
SANTINO FONTANA:
No, not at all.

00:23:44.656 --> 00:23:45.920
I feel great.

00:23:45.920 --> 00:23:47.680
ALAN SEALES: You have your
band of merry men.

00:23:47.680 --> 00:23:48.930
SANTINO FONTANA: I do.

00:23:54.512 --> 00:23:56.810
I originally didn't have any
interest in being in

00:23:56.810 --> 00:23:58.950
"Cinderella" or playing the
prince, because we don't

00:23:58.950 --> 00:24:01.610
typically know anything
about the prince.

00:24:01.610 --> 00:24:03.720
We know nothing about his
personality or anything.

00:24:03.720 --> 00:24:05.270
And then when I got the script,
which Douglas Carter

00:24:05.270 --> 00:24:09.480
Beane had written after Ted and
Robyn got together, his

00:24:09.480 --> 00:24:11.020
very first line--

00:24:11.020 --> 00:24:12.040
I can say that, right?

00:24:12.040 --> 00:24:12.930
Should I not say that?

00:24:12.930 --> 00:24:13.770
I can say that.

00:24:13.770 --> 00:24:16.910
So the very first line in the
very original script-- it's

00:24:16.910 --> 00:24:18.010
slightly changed--

00:24:18.010 --> 00:24:22.340
he slays a giant,
first of all.

00:24:22.340 --> 00:24:25.900
And then on top of the giant,
he says, "I just wish I was

00:24:25.900 --> 00:24:31.690
doing something more important
with my life." And I laughed,

00:24:31.690 --> 00:24:33.580
and I was like, OK,
this is great.

00:24:33.580 --> 00:24:38.680
So he also has no parents.

00:24:38.680 --> 00:24:41.500
His parents passed away, and
he's kind of rudderless and

00:24:41.500 --> 00:24:44.900
trying to figure out who should
I be and how should I

00:24:44.900 --> 00:24:46.770
be and how can I
be a good king.

00:24:46.770 --> 00:24:51.720
And he also is very empathic,
and he worries about the

00:24:51.720 --> 00:24:53.870
people of his kingdom.

00:24:53.870 --> 00:24:57.450
And he is, actually, fairly
alone through the play.

00:24:57.450 --> 00:24:59.930
There's a great actor, Peter
Bartlett, who plays kind of

00:24:59.930 --> 00:25:02.380
his advisor.

00:25:02.380 --> 00:25:05.700
And he's corrupt and trying to
get power for himself, and I

00:25:05.700 --> 00:25:07.620
discover that through
the show.

00:25:07.620 --> 00:25:09.490
But that's already so much
more complex than

00:25:09.490 --> 00:25:11.240
what we're used to.

00:25:11.240 --> 00:25:13.890
But I also think with a modern
audience, you don't want to

00:25:13.890 --> 00:25:17.040
root for the girl to fall
in love with a guy

00:25:17.040 --> 00:25:19.040
we don't know now.

00:25:19.040 --> 00:25:20.690
We're like, oh, yes,
he's tall.

00:25:20.690 --> 00:25:22.140
Go.

00:25:22.140 --> 00:25:23.890
That's not enough anymore.

00:25:23.890 --> 00:25:25.690
You're like, he may abuse you.

00:25:25.690 --> 00:25:28.250
We don't know anything
about him.

00:25:28.250 --> 00:25:31.310
Or he could be too
stupid for you.

00:25:31.310 --> 00:25:34.830
So I think what's great is kind
of embracing that, and

00:25:34.830 --> 00:25:36.800
that what makes somebody
charming is less to do with

00:25:36.800 --> 00:25:40.180
what they look like and more
to do with what they do.

00:25:40.180 --> 00:25:40.670
ALAN SEALES: You have a name.

00:25:40.670 --> 00:25:41.710
You're not Prince Charming.

00:25:41.710 --> 00:25:42.120
SANTINO FONTANA: Exactly.

00:25:42.120 --> 00:25:43.690
His name is Topher.

00:25:43.690 --> 00:25:44.710
He chose that.

00:25:44.710 --> 00:25:45.590
It's Christopher, actually.

00:25:45.590 --> 00:25:46.085
LAURA OSNES: Short
for Christopher.

00:25:46.085 --> 00:25:46.950
SANTINO FONTANA: Short
for Christopher.

00:25:46.950 --> 00:25:48.926
ALAN SEALES: "Chris-topher."

00:25:48.926 --> 00:25:50.820
SANTINO FONTANA: Yeah,
so there you go.

00:25:50.820 --> 00:25:52.070
Yeah, but it's a great time.

00:25:56.520 --> 00:25:58.872
I'm off stage like half the
show, and people always, I

00:25:58.872 --> 00:26:00.460
think, think I'm on stage
more, because I'm always

00:26:00.460 --> 00:26:01.490
talked about.

00:26:01.490 --> 00:26:06.610
Because as Harriet explained,
in this world, the prince is

00:26:06.610 --> 00:26:11.080
looking for a wife, and so
that's the quickest way to get

00:26:11.080 --> 00:26:13.810
something to happen.

00:26:13.810 --> 00:26:14.220
ALAN SEALES: Cool.

00:26:14.220 --> 00:26:18.430
So I want to go back to the
audition process, because the

00:26:18.430 --> 00:26:23.550
whole behind the scenes aspect
of all of this always has

00:26:23.550 --> 00:26:27.160
intrigued me and always
has interested me.

00:26:27.160 --> 00:26:28.270
Each of you--

00:26:28.270 --> 00:26:29.170
take turns, I guess--

00:26:29.170 --> 00:26:30.690
when did you get involved?

00:26:30.690 --> 00:26:33.580
And at what point where
you like, yup,

00:26:33.580 --> 00:26:34.910
this is my next role.

00:26:34.910 --> 00:26:35.790
I want to do this.

00:26:35.790 --> 00:26:37.320
This is great.

00:26:37.320 --> 00:26:39.930
Show me the money.

00:26:39.930 --> 00:26:43.370
ANN HARADA: This is a very
boring answer for this

00:26:43.370 --> 00:26:48.190
particular show, because we
were all called and said,

00:26:48.190 --> 00:26:51.800
would you like to do a reading
of "Cinderella?" And I said,

00:26:51.800 --> 00:26:52.650
yes, I would.

00:26:52.650 --> 00:26:56.870
So we showed up in January of
2012, and we worked for a week

00:26:56.870 --> 00:26:57.990
together, and we
did a reading.

00:26:57.990 --> 00:26:58.550
LAURA OSNES: All of us.

00:26:58.550 --> 00:26:59.760
ANN HARADA: All of us.

00:26:59.760 --> 00:27:00.640
And that was it.

00:27:00.640 --> 00:27:02.230
We never auditioned.

00:27:02.230 --> 00:27:04.804
That was it.

00:27:04.804 --> 00:27:07.240
It was like, we like you.

00:27:07.240 --> 00:27:09.380
OK, thanks, that was awesome.

00:27:09.380 --> 00:27:13.440
And I went home, and I thought,
if this actually

00:27:13.440 --> 00:27:16.160
comes to Broadway, this will
be my next Broadway show.

00:27:16.160 --> 00:27:18.390
But I don't know if it's going
to come to Broadway.

00:27:18.390 --> 00:27:21.630
Because we are always involved
in readings and things where

00:27:21.630 --> 00:27:25.700
they say, we are on a fast
track to Broadway, and it

00:27:25.700 --> 00:27:26.400
never happens.

00:27:26.400 --> 00:27:29.860
I mean, I'm sure we all have
many, many shows we could say

00:27:29.860 --> 00:27:30.270
that about.

00:27:30.270 --> 00:27:36.260
So it was thrilling to be a
part of that idea, and the

00:27:36.260 --> 00:27:39.560
idea that somebody had actually
handpicked us and

00:27:39.560 --> 00:27:42.830
said, we think you'd be right
for these roles is fantastic.

00:27:42.830 --> 00:27:45.260
But we didn't audition.

00:27:45.260 --> 00:27:46.830
ALAN SEALES: How much of the
score did you know beforehand,

00:27:46.830 --> 00:27:47.770
all of you?

00:27:47.770 --> 00:27:49.650
ANN HARADA: All.

00:27:49.650 --> 00:27:50.540
SANTINO FONTANA: I didn't.

00:27:50.540 --> 00:27:51.790
I didn't.

00:27:55.200 --> 00:27:57.850
The play I was doing before
this, Robyn Goodman, the

00:27:57.850 --> 00:27:59.420
producer, also produced
that play.

00:27:59.420 --> 00:28:02.720
And when she gave me the script,
I was humming "Ten

00:28:02.720 --> 00:28:04.550
Minutes Ago." That's the
only song I've really

00:28:04.550 --> 00:28:05.880
knew knew from it.

00:28:05.880 --> 00:28:07.240
So I was pretty new to it.

00:28:07.240 --> 00:28:08.522
But you knew all of it.

00:28:08.522 --> 00:28:08.890
LAURA OSNES: No.

00:28:08.890 --> 00:28:10.790
I knew "In My Own Little
Corner." I had sung that song,

00:28:10.790 --> 00:28:13.430
which is Cinderella's kind
of "I want" song.

00:28:13.430 --> 00:28:14.540
her first song in the show.

00:28:14.540 --> 00:28:16.990
And I had learned it in voice
lessons when I was

00:28:16.990 --> 00:28:18.010
like 10 years old.

00:28:18.010 --> 00:28:20.650
And I remember being familiar
with "Ten Minutes Ago" and

00:28:20.650 --> 00:28:22.800
familiar with some of the other
songs, but only because

00:28:22.800 --> 00:28:26.090
I had heard them somewhere in my
psyche of growing up, which

00:28:26.090 --> 00:28:28.400
is true of many Rodgers
&amp; Hammerstein songs.

00:28:28.400 --> 00:28:30.250
I did not grow up watching
the movie.

00:28:30.250 --> 00:28:31.740
I still have not seen it.

00:28:31.740 --> 00:28:35.740
I saw the Brandy version
once in like 1994 or

00:28:35.740 --> 00:28:37.920
whenever it came out.

00:28:37.920 --> 00:28:39.240
But that's kind of it.

00:28:39.240 --> 00:28:39.850
So I was familiar.

00:28:39.850 --> 00:28:40.970
SANTINO FONTANA: Why do you say
the Brandy version and not

00:28:40.970 --> 00:28:42.120
the Whitney Houston version?

00:28:42.120 --> 00:28:43.400
LAURA OSNES: Because Brandy
played Cinderella.

00:28:43.400 --> 00:28:44.050
ANN HARADA: Brandy played
Cinderella.

00:28:44.050 --> 00:28:45.390
SANTINO FONTANA: I know, but
it's Whitney Houston.

00:28:45.390 --> 00:28:46.140
LAURA OSNES: Whitney
produced it.

00:28:46.140 --> 00:28:47.140
ANN HARADA: But have
you seen it?

00:28:47.140 --> 00:28:47.380
SANTINO FONTANA: Bobby!

00:28:47.380 --> 00:28:48.796
Bobby!

00:28:48.796 --> 00:28:51.420
Love it.

00:28:51.420 --> 00:28:52.675
Yes, I've seen it.

00:28:52.675 --> 00:28:54.260
ANN HARADA: Well, it's
not really her movie.

00:28:54.260 --> 00:28:55.480
SANTINO FONTANA: But it's
Whitney Houston.

00:28:55.480 --> 00:28:57.020
ANN HARADA: But it's
Brandy's movie.

00:28:57.020 --> 00:28:59.132
SANTINO FONTANA: Whatever.

00:28:59.132 --> 00:29:00.140
LAURA OSNES: It's called
"Cinderella."

00:29:00.140 --> 00:29:03.660
SANTINO FONTANA: I feel bad
for her, that's all.

00:29:03.660 --> 00:29:04.900
ALAN SEALES: Generalizng,
backing up.

00:29:04.900 --> 00:29:07.230
Are there any auditions in your
past in your career that

00:29:07.230 --> 00:29:09.060
you have gone into,
and you're like.

00:29:09.060 --> 00:29:10.300
God, I screwed this up?

00:29:10.300 --> 00:29:11.320
SANTINO FONTANA: We've
never auditioned.

00:29:11.320 --> 00:29:12.780
None of us.

00:29:12.780 --> 00:29:14.160
We've never auditioned.

00:29:14.160 --> 00:29:16.305
We're offer only.

00:29:16.305 --> 00:29:18.090
That's all of us.

00:29:18.090 --> 00:29:19.340
HARRIET HARRIS: And it
always works out.

00:29:22.440 --> 00:29:25.030
SANTINO FONTANA: Like yesterday,
I had a callback

00:29:25.030 --> 00:29:28.120
for something in the morning
in Brooklyn by the

00:29:28.120 --> 00:29:29.700
water at 11:00 AM.

00:29:29.700 --> 00:29:32.870
And I was like, what the
hell am I doing here?

00:29:32.870 --> 00:29:34.230
ALAN SEALES: 11:00
AM is early?

00:29:34.230 --> 00:29:35.450
SANTINO FONTANA: Yes.

00:29:35.450 --> 00:29:36.730
MARLA MINDELLE: That's
like 6:00 AM.

00:29:36.730 --> 00:29:39.150
SANTINO FONTANA: I get
done at 11:00 PM.

00:29:39.150 --> 00:29:41.000
We get out of the
show at 10:30.

00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:41.980
You go home at 11:00.

00:29:41.980 --> 00:29:42.560
Then you eat.

00:29:42.560 --> 00:29:47.125
You go to sleep at 2:00 or
whatever, if you go to sleep.

00:29:47.125 --> 00:29:49.030
She goes a lot of bars.

00:29:49.030 --> 00:29:50.430
I'm kidding.

00:29:50.430 --> 00:29:53.750
She doesn't drink.

00:29:53.750 --> 00:29:54.230
ALAN SEALES: Water.

00:29:54.230 --> 00:29:54.510
SANTINO FONTANA: No.

00:29:54.510 --> 00:29:57.010
What I'm saying is that
happens all the time.

00:29:57.010 --> 00:29:58.500
Yes, constantly.

00:29:58.500 --> 00:29:59.050
Constantly.

00:29:59.050 --> 00:30:01.270
It's like a job interview
constantly.

00:30:01.270 --> 00:30:04.310
You're constantly on
a job interview.

00:30:04.310 --> 00:30:06.270
We were just talking about
what's so lovely here--

00:30:06.270 --> 00:30:07.290
we had a tour of the building.

00:30:07.290 --> 00:30:10.360
And it seems like
such a safe--

00:30:10.360 --> 00:30:13.700
I'm sure you all have opinions
about that as well-- but it

00:30:13.700 --> 00:30:17.000
seems, from our point of view,
there's so many things here to

00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:18.550
support you.

00:30:18.550 --> 00:30:21.400
So you're trying something
new, and if it fails and

00:30:21.400 --> 00:30:23.860
you're moving toward something
but you keep having small

00:30:23.860 --> 00:30:26.165
failures along the way, you have
the security of knowing I

00:30:26.165 --> 00:30:29.040
can come back tomorrow and play
pool over there and then

00:30:29.040 --> 00:30:30.210
go over there.

00:30:30.210 --> 00:30:33.250
We are in our apartments alone
with a piece of paper, and

00:30:33.250 --> 00:30:34.680
we're trying to make
that piece of paper

00:30:34.680 --> 00:30:36.530
come to life alone.

00:30:36.530 --> 00:30:40.960
And then it's on us to go into
a room and create a reality

00:30:40.960 --> 00:30:44.170
that doesn't exist for somebody
on another side of a

00:30:44.170 --> 00:30:45.860
table who has to judge that.

00:30:45.860 --> 00:30:47.490
And that's constant.

00:30:47.490 --> 00:30:50.340
So that kind of job interview
process is something that's

00:30:50.340 --> 00:30:53.600
very normal to us and something
we're very used to.

00:30:53.600 --> 00:30:55.030
ALAN SEALES: So life
of an actor.

00:30:55.030 --> 00:31:00.160
You just described the awesome
sauce that makes auditions.

00:31:00.160 --> 00:31:04.060
Talking about, I guess,
wider picture still.

00:31:04.060 --> 00:31:08.230
Backing up, as a young,
strapping lad, you said, I'm

00:31:08.230 --> 00:31:11.640
going to grow up, and I'm
going to be on stage.

00:31:11.640 --> 00:31:15.530
What made you want to do that?

00:31:15.530 --> 00:31:19.850
All of you, when did you
decide, this is for me?

00:31:19.850 --> 00:31:21.790
I want to struggle
and possibly wait

00:31:21.790 --> 00:31:24.450
tables my whole life.

00:31:24.450 --> 00:31:26.200
SANTINO FONTANA: You know,
everyone says that.

00:31:26.200 --> 00:31:27.700
I never felt like--

00:31:27.700 --> 00:31:29.930
MARLA MINDELLE: Waited tables?

00:31:29.930 --> 00:31:31.670
SANTINO FONTANA: I never felt
like, I want to struggle.

00:31:34.910 --> 00:31:37.700
I mean, now in hindsight, I
can say, yeah, whoa, I was

00:31:37.700 --> 00:31:39.040
struggling in that point.

00:31:39.040 --> 00:31:44.620
But while I was in it, I'd
never felt like it was.

00:31:44.620 --> 00:31:47.780
Someone asked us the other day,
when did you decide to

00:31:47.780 --> 00:31:50.390
sacrifice so many
things for this?

00:31:50.390 --> 00:31:52.320
And it never felt like
a sacrifice,

00:31:52.320 --> 00:31:53.950
because it's what I love.

00:31:56.531 --> 00:31:59.280
I wanted to be a baseball player
in high school, and it

00:31:59.280 --> 00:32:00.730
was between baseball and this.

00:32:00.730 --> 00:32:02.520
And the funny thing is there's a
girl from my high school who

00:32:02.520 --> 00:32:05.040
works at Google, Kelly Wilde.

00:32:05.040 --> 00:32:05.810
She's on vacation.

00:32:05.810 --> 00:32:07.320
Bitch.

00:32:07.320 --> 00:32:08.090
Kidding.

00:32:08.090 --> 00:32:08.950
I'm kidding.

00:32:08.950 --> 00:32:10.740
I love her.

00:32:10.740 --> 00:32:13.600
But I remember thinking when
I finally was like, no, I'm

00:32:13.600 --> 00:32:17.850
better at this, and it brings
more joy than anything else,

00:32:17.850 --> 00:32:21.190
then there is no sacrifice,
and there is no struggle.

00:32:21.190 --> 00:32:22.640
It's just what you do.

00:32:25.230 --> 00:32:28.800
ALAN SEALES: And the rest of
you have similar stories?

00:32:28.800 --> 00:32:30.270
MARLA MINDELLE: From
the womb I wanted

00:32:30.270 --> 00:32:31.550
to perform and struggle.

00:32:31.550 --> 00:32:36.400
My father wrote music and so my
mother, when I was inside

00:32:36.400 --> 00:32:38.440
her belly, would be
playing "Evita"

00:32:38.440 --> 00:32:39.360
and all these musicals.

00:32:39.360 --> 00:32:42.820
And I really think that I was
genetically programmed to pop

00:32:42.820 --> 00:32:45.920
out and want to do this for
a living, because I was

00:32:45.920 --> 00:32:47.610
surrounded by it 24/7.

00:32:47.610 --> 00:32:50.070
And I got into basketball.

00:32:50.070 --> 00:32:51.090
I was a sports person.

00:32:51.090 --> 00:32:53.010
But then in high school,
I was just like, I just

00:32:53.010 --> 00:32:54.160
gotta pursue this.

00:32:54.160 --> 00:32:59.500
And so I went to college for
it, and then got lucky, and

00:32:59.500 --> 00:33:01.980
here I am with these
fine people.

00:33:01.980 --> 00:33:05.200
ALAN SEALES: So Harriet and
Ann, you guys have some TV

00:33:05.200 --> 00:33:06.450
experience as well.

00:33:09.375 --> 00:33:12.160
Waking up in the morning,
do you choose theater?

00:33:12.160 --> 00:33:13.740
Do you choose TV?

00:33:13.740 --> 00:33:16.770
Which one-- you're giving me
a funny look over there.

00:33:16.770 --> 00:33:19.950
HARRIET HARRIS: Well, right
now, I'm choosing theater.

00:33:19.950 --> 00:33:20.740
ALAN SEALES: Right.

00:33:20.740 --> 00:33:22.510
If you could pick one to do--

00:33:22.510 --> 00:33:23.990
HARRIET HARRIS: I wouldn't
want to do that.

00:33:23.990 --> 00:33:24.430
ALAN SEALES: TV?

00:33:24.430 --> 00:33:25.610
HARRIET HARRIS: No,
at this point, I

00:33:25.610 --> 00:33:26.190
wouldn't want to do it.

00:33:26.190 --> 00:33:27.265
I like change.

00:33:27.265 --> 00:33:29.670
It's like working on
different projects.

00:33:29.670 --> 00:33:31.630
It is a very different
thing to do.

00:33:31.630 --> 00:33:33.370
And for the first--

00:33:33.370 --> 00:33:36.740
Oh, God, I've been an
actress so long--

00:33:36.740 --> 00:33:38.270
and that was part of it.

00:33:38.270 --> 00:33:41.820
And you get better and better
and better usually as you do

00:33:41.820 --> 00:33:43.370
it, and you start to think,
I know how to do that.

00:33:43.370 --> 00:33:44.360
I know how to do that.

00:33:44.360 --> 00:33:47.810
The thing that used to be such
a challenge isn't a challenge

00:33:47.810 --> 00:33:50.640
anymore, and I have to figure
out how to do something else,

00:33:50.640 --> 00:33:51.990
because I know how to do this.

00:33:51.990 --> 00:33:53.000
I can break down a scene.

00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:54.120
I know what the story is.

00:33:54.120 --> 00:33:55.390
I know how to tell the story.

00:33:55.390 --> 00:33:57.070
I know how to do the jokes.

00:33:57.070 --> 00:33:59.930
And there were so many things
that I just thought, you could

00:33:59.930 --> 00:34:03.020
get carpal tunnel syndrome from
being an actor if you

00:34:03.020 --> 00:34:05.170
don't do a lot of different
kinds of things.

00:34:05.170 --> 00:34:08.520
So I went with a play out to
California, and suddenly there

00:34:08.520 --> 00:34:10.650
was an opportunity to start
doing television, and I didn't

00:34:10.650 --> 00:34:11.670
know how to do it.

00:34:11.670 --> 00:34:12.790
And I thought, this is great.

00:34:12.790 --> 00:34:15.580
I used some of the same tools.

00:34:15.580 --> 00:34:18.750
I'm pursuing the same
sorts of things.

00:34:18.750 --> 00:34:20.870
But I had to learn how to use
them differently, and I have

00:34:20.870 --> 00:34:23.292
to grab different tools from
the box that I didn't even

00:34:23.292 --> 00:34:24.850
know those tools were
in that box.

00:34:24.850 --> 00:34:26.989
So I liked that.

00:34:26.989 --> 00:34:30.050
And then I got sort of
proficient at that, and I

00:34:30.050 --> 00:34:32.690
thought, oh, I really don't know
anything about musicals.

00:34:32.690 --> 00:34:35.179
And somebody asked me to do a
musical, and I went, oh, that

00:34:35.179 --> 00:34:36.750
will be really exciting to do.

00:34:36.750 --> 00:34:40.469
So that, I think, is important
to keep doing different things

00:34:40.469 --> 00:34:41.719
and challenging oneself.

00:34:45.199 --> 00:34:47.590
And to say, I'm only doing this
from now, I don't think

00:34:47.590 --> 00:34:49.880
I'd like to do that.

00:34:49.880 --> 00:34:50.250
ALAN SEALES: OK.

00:34:50.250 --> 00:34:54.429
So there's certain things of
each that you like more at

00:34:54.429 --> 00:34:55.489
different times.

00:34:55.489 --> 00:34:55.989
HARRIET HARRIS: Oh, yeah.

00:34:55.989 --> 00:34:56.520
ALAN SEALES: Yeah.

00:34:56.520 --> 00:34:57.930
I mean, what's the big
difference though?

00:35:02.240 --> 00:35:06.100
HARRIET HARRIS: It's the
difference between, say,

00:35:06.100 --> 00:35:08.250
talking to your best friend
and yelling at them and

00:35:08.250 --> 00:35:09.340
whispering to them.

00:35:09.340 --> 00:35:14.630
It's the same relationship, the
same overall relationship,

00:35:14.630 --> 00:35:16.910
and a different way of
expressing oneself.

00:35:16.910 --> 00:35:22.000
And I think that you want
both of those things.

00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:25.830
In a real relationship, maybe
you don't spend most of your

00:35:25.830 --> 00:35:28.640
time talking to your best friend
whispering or shouting.

00:35:28.640 --> 00:35:32.490
But that exists, and so it's
nice to have that spectrum.

00:35:32.490 --> 00:35:35.020
ALAN SEALES: Is there a
question over here?

00:35:35.020 --> 00:35:35.755
I'm sorry.

00:35:35.755 --> 00:35:36.240
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:35:36.240 --> 00:35:37.520
First, I just want to
say you guys are

00:35:37.520 --> 00:35:38.990
all absolutely amazing.

00:35:38.990 --> 00:35:41.620
I haven't gotten a chance to see
the performance yet, but

00:35:41.620 --> 00:35:42.710
I'm very excited.

00:35:42.710 --> 00:35:44.764
I'm going to go out and buy
my tickets after this.

00:35:44.764 --> 00:35:45.530
ANN HARADA: Yay!

00:35:45.530 --> 00:35:48.340
AUDIENCE: I actually grew
up watching the original

00:35:48.340 --> 00:35:51.100
original, not the
Brandy version.

00:35:51.100 --> 00:35:55.860
And my question is, I'm actually
a bit of a purist.

00:35:55.860 --> 00:36:00.270
I find that I love the
originals, and I find myself

00:36:00.270 --> 00:36:02.010
going back to them
over and over.

00:36:02.010 --> 00:36:05.100
I liked the Brandy one, but the
original was my favorite.

00:36:05.100 --> 00:36:07.990
Have you felt that there's
been any backlash or

00:36:07.990 --> 00:36:11.610
unhappiness from people that
you've changed the story?

00:36:11.610 --> 00:36:13.250
The characters are slightly
different, that you didn't

00:36:13.250 --> 00:36:14.810
kind of stick to the original?

00:36:14.810 --> 00:36:18.060
Not that I don't love this
version, but just curious.

00:36:18.060 --> 00:36:20.140
SANTINO FONTANA: When you say
the original, was that the

00:36:20.140 --> 00:36:22.450
Julie Andrews one or the
Lesley Ann Warren one?

00:36:22.450 --> 00:36:23.190
AUDIENCE: The Lesley
Ann Warren one.

00:36:23.190 --> 00:36:26.470
SANTINO FONTANA: So that was
actually the second one.

00:36:26.470 --> 00:36:27.691
AUDIENCE: Oh, now this
is embarrassing

00:36:27.691 --> 00:36:29.640
SANTINO FONTANA: No,
this is perfect.

00:36:29.640 --> 00:36:32.140
And it's also hilarious to me
that you work at Google, which

00:36:32.140 --> 00:36:34.130
is the most progressive
company in the world.

00:36:34.130 --> 00:36:39.370
But there is actually
no original.

00:36:39.370 --> 00:36:42.450
Perrault wrote a French fairy
tale which actually had three

00:36:42.450 --> 00:36:46.150
balls, where they'd dance and
then she would run away.

00:36:46.150 --> 00:36:47.780
And he'd be like, God, I wish
she could come back.

00:36:47.780 --> 00:36:49.160
And then there would be second
ball, and then he'd be like,

00:36:49.160 --> 00:36:50.570
God, I wish she could
come back.

00:36:50.570 --> 00:36:52.800
And then the third ball,
she left her shoe.

00:36:52.800 --> 00:36:56.590
So then we have somehow, with
the help of Disney and Rodgers

00:36:56.590 --> 00:36:58.720
&amp; Hammerstein, we've changed
that story as

00:36:58.720 --> 00:37:01.270
time has moved on.

00:37:01.270 --> 00:37:04.400
And so the original Julie
Andrews version, which was

00:37:04.400 --> 00:37:09.060
shorter, actually, even than the
Lesley Ann Warren version,

00:37:09.060 --> 00:37:10.470
they're both different scripts,
which is also

00:37:10.470 --> 00:37:12.850
different from the Brandy
version, which has a Rodgers &amp;

00:37:12.850 --> 00:37:14.120
Hart song in it.

00:37:14.120 --> 00:37:16.250
So it's truly a living thing.

00:37:16.250 --> 00:37:20.130
It really doesn't have
an original.

00:37:20.130 --> 00:37:23.770
That said, yes, there are people
who come expecting the

00:37:23.770 --> 00:37:26.090
Disney cartoon and
are wondering why

00:37:26.090 --> 00:37:27.513
the mice don't sing.

00:37:27.513 --> 00:37:28.240
LAURA OSNES: And why
I'm not blonde.

00:37:28.240 --> 00:37:30.030
SANTINO FONTANA: And why
she's not blonde.

00:37:30.030 --> 00:37:32.820
And that's to say, hey, people
have strong emotional

00:37:32.820 --> 00:37:35.460
reactions to all different forms
of art in all different

00:37:35.460 --> 00:37:39.750
times, and we respect and
totally uphold that.

00:37:39.750 --> 00:37:44.500
At the same time, our version
is just this version.

00:37:44.500 --> 00:37:47.590
But every version, there isn't
actually an original.

00:37:47.590 --> 00:37:48.875
That's kind of the biggest--

00:37:48.875 --> 00:37:50.070
LAURA OSNES: Every time it's
done, it's been adjusted.

00:37:50.070 --> 00:37:51.660
SANTINO FONTANA: It's been
adjusted every time.

00:37:51.660 --> 00:37:55.210
I mean, so is "Hamlet." There's
quarto versions.

00:37:55.210 --> 00:37:55.940
There's a second quarto.

00:37:55.940 --> 00:37:57.640
I love when there's purists for
Shakespeare, and they're

00:37:57.640 --> 00:38:01.650
like, why did you cut this
line from Act 2, scene 3?

00:38:01.650 --> 00:38:03.740
And I'm like, well,
that's the quarto.

00:38:03.740 --> 00:38:04.910
We're doing the folio.

00:38:04.910 --> 00:38:08.820
So there's always a living,
breathing thing.

00:38:08.820 --> 00:38:10.680
And I just love that,
because I love that

00:38:10.680 --> 00:38:11.910
that's what we do--

00:38:11.910 --> 00:38:15.040
something that's so alive
it can't stay still.

00:38:15.040 --> 00:38:18.250
And if you try to trap
it, it won't work.

00:38:18.250 --> 00:38:19.760
HARRIET HARRIS: But there
are people at the end.

00:38:19.760 --> 00:38:22.840
They're usually people
lined up--

00:38:22.840 --> 00:38:24.010
and it's very sweet.

00:38:24.010 --> 00:38:24.820
Some of them are children.

00:38:24.820 --> 00:38:28.135
Some of them are grown women
with crowns on--

00:38:28.135 --> 00:38:30.490
that want to have their
playbills signed.

00:38:30.490 --> 00:38:37.400
And sometimes people do say,
I love the show, but I'm

00:38:37.400 --> 00:38:40.590
struggling with a couple
of things.

00:38:40.590 --> 00:38:44.390
And you think, you're struggling
about "Cinderella"?

00:38:44.390 --> 00:38:46.090
What must your life be like?

00:38:48.910 --> 00:38:51.290
But there are a couple of things
in the show that are

00:38:51.290 --> 00:38:55.760
significantly different, and
most people adore that.

00:38:55.760 --> 00:38:58.120
And most people go, you know,
I really thought I knew it,

00:38:58.120 --> 00:39:00.140
and I'm so thrilled that there's
a reason to come back

00:39:00.140 --> 00:39:02.780
for the second act.

00:39:02.780 --> 00:39:07.430
So the choices that were made, I
think, make it a little more

00:39:07.430 --> 00:39:09.080
titillating for people
to come back again.

00:39:09.080 --> 00:39:13.270
ANN HARADA: I personally,
personally guarantee that this

00:39:13.270 --> 00:39:18.230
is as true in spirit to that
version that is in your head,

00:39:18.230 --> 00:39:21.550
because there's no way I would
have done this show if I

00:39:21.550 --> 00:39:24.730
thought it was in any way
disrespectful or untrue to

00:39:24.730 --> 00:39:27.350
what the themes are in that.

00:39:27.350 --> 00:39:30.270
I revere the R&amp;H canon.

00:39:30.270 --> 00:39:33.400
I've seen every movie, every
blah blah, every iteration of

00:39:33.400 --> 00:39:36.060
the story so far.

00:39:36.060 --> 00:39:40.870
And it's a new version, and yes,
some things might throw

00:39:40.870 --> 00:39:41.500
you a little bit.

00:39:41.500 --> 00:39:44.030
But I promise you, you will
feel the same feelings.

00:39:44.030 --> 00:39:44.480
LAURA OSNES: That's it.

00:39:44.480 --> 00:39:45.320
ANN HARADA: You'll feel
all the feelings.

00:39:45.320 --> 00:39:46.101
SANTINO FONTANA: Yup.

00:39:46.101 --> 00:39:48.930
TED CHAPIN: Can I have
a quick shot at that?

00:39:48.930 --> 00:39:51.510
ALAN SEALES: We're running
short on time.

00:39:51.510 --> 00:39:53.380
TED CHAPIN: I'm usually the one
who gets it in the neck

00:39:53.380 --> 00:39:57.880
for having been impure about
things Rodgers &amp; Hammerstein.

00:39:57.880 --> 00:40:00.520
And so I like hearing this,
because the fact is it has

00:40:00.520 --> 00:40:02.110
been changed every
time slightly.

00:40:02.110 --> 00:40:04.740
But the thing I wanted to say is
one of the challenges when

00:40:04.740 --> 00:40:06.500
you do something like this,
and you take what was

00:40:06.500 --> 00:40:10.220
basically 70 minutes of material
in 1957 and make it

00:40:10.220 --> 00:40:13.840
into a Broadway show, you have
to add to the score.

00:40:13.840 --> 00:40:16.710
And I think the reason that the
two songs that you heard

00:40:16.710 --> 00:40:21.070
about earlier that ended up not
being in is because you

00:40:21.070 --> 00:40:23.140
don't a composer and lyricist
in the room to whom you can

00:40:23.140 --> 00:40:26.380
say, could you change that
song a little bit?

00:40:26.380 --> 00:40:30.730
You kind of have the song that
we have in the files to offer,

00:40:30.730 --> 00:40:33.900
and both of those songs, they
did incredibly well.

00:40:33.900 --> 00:40:34.890
The problem was not them.

00:40:34.890 --> 00:40:37.350
The problem was the material,
and it just didn't really

00:40:37.350 --> 00:40:40.750
support what the entire
rest of the show was.

00:40:40.750 --> 00:40:44.200
And that's a challenge when
you do something like this

00:40:44.200 --> 00:40:46.830
where you're taking the basics
of something from before and

00:40:46.830 --> 00:40:47.500
adding to it.

00:40:47.500 --> 00:40:50.260
I just wanted to say that.

00:40:50.260 --> 00:40:52.280
ALAN SEALES: Over here.

00:40:52.280 --> 00:40:53.170
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:40:53.170 --> 00:40:55.570
I saw the show a couple weeks
ago, and I really loved it.

00:40:55.570 --> 00:40:57.790
One of the things that really
impressed me about the show

00:40:57.790 --> 00:41:00.690
was the costumes of the show,
and especially Cinderella and

00:41:00.690 --> 00:41:03.310
Fairy Godmother had these huge
transformations where one

00:41:03.310 --> 00:41:04.740
minute they were in
plainclothes, and the next

00:41:04.740 --> 00:41:09.170
minute they were suddenly in
these giant ballgowns.

00:41:09.170 --> 00:41:10.440
And I want to know
what was it like

00:41:10.440 --> 00:41:11.680
working with those costumes?

00:41:11.680 --> 00:41:13.430
Maybe more directed
toward Laura.

00:41:13.430 --> 00:41:16.400
How easy was it to set up that
costume and then unleash it?

00:41:16.400 --> 00:41:19.880
And just in general, how did
you guys manage such quick

00:41:19.880 --> 00:41:20.710
costume changes?

00:41:20.710 --> 00:41:23.120
Sometimes you'll bounce out, and
all of a sudden you're in

00:41:23.120 --> 00:41:25.700
a completely new dress and
completely new hair.

00:41:25.700 --> 00:41:26.860
And it just baffled me.

00:41:26.860 --> 00:41:27.350
It was amazing.

00:41:27.350 --> 00:41:28.280
LAURA OSNES: I'm so glad.

00:41:28.280 --> 00:41:31.310
Has anyone else seen the show
here by raising hands?

00:41:31.310 --> 00:41:32.010
A few people?

00:41:32.010 --> 00:41:33.990
That's great.

00:41:33.990 --> 00:41:36.340
The costume changes are really
amazingly, and William Ivey

00:41:36.340 --> 00:41:38.640
Long, our customer designer,
won the Tony Award for his

00:41:38.640 --> 00:41:40.250
costume design for our show.

00:41:40.250 --> 00:41:42.680
And it's so rightly deserved,
because the design behind

00:41:42.680 --> 00:41:45.060
these transformation costumes
is flawless.

00:41:45.060 --> 00:41:47.570
It's absolutely amazing, and I
think revolutionary in the

00:41:47.570 --> 00:41:51.110
world of theater
quick changes.

00:41:51.110 --> 00:41:53.180
I have three transformations
in the show,

00:41:53.180 --> 00:41:55.530
and they all happen--

00:41:55.530 --> 00:41:57.530
unfortunately, I can't really
reveal any of the secrets to

00:41:57.530 --> 00:41:59.310
you-- but they all happen
in front of your eyes.

00:41:59.310 --> 00:42:00.680
We don't use any body doubles.

00:42:00.680 --> 00:42:02.180
We don't do blackouts.

00:42:02.180 --> 00:42:03.930
It's literally like
pull a thing--

00:42:03.930 --> 00:42:05.290
ALAN SEALES: There's
no fog either.

00:42:05.290 --> 00:42:05.920
LAURA OSNES: There's no fog.

00:42:05.920 --> 00:42:07.800
It all happens, and everyone's
like, how did you do it?

00:42:07.800 --> 00:42:10.230
And I'm like, if you watch,
you could know.

00:42:10.230 --> 00:42:14.630
But it all happens so fast, and
the design behind it is

00:42:14.630 --> 00:42:15.680
kind of foolproof.

00:42:15.680 --> 00:42:17.660
I always tell people the very
first time I did the

00:42:17.660 --> 00:42:22.580
transformations in the costume
shop with burlap fabric in the

00:42:22.580 --> 00:42:25.110
pre-test versions,
they worked.

00:42:25.110 --> 00:42:29.190
So it was a matter of finessing
it to make it look

00:42:29.190 --> 00:42:31.680
natural and make it look like
it was happening to me as

00:42:31.680 --> 00:42:33.370
opposed to me doing
it to myself.

00:42:33.370 --> 00:42:36.230
I'm pretty much in charge of
my quick changes, which is

00:42:36.230 --> 00:42:38.250
awesome and terrifying
at the same time.

00:42:38.250 --> 00:42:43.540
But we haven't had any disasters
yet, and I always

00:42:43.540 --> 00:42:44.960
love hearing the audience
reactions.

00:42:44.960 --> 00:42:46.370
But it just took a
little finessing

00:42:46.370 --> 00:42:47.130
and a little practice.

00:42:47.130 --> 00:42:49.910
But the design behind it,
it's like snaps and

00:42:49.910 --> 00:42:51.180
Velcro, which work.

00:42:51.180 --> 00:42:52.830
We're not relying on technology

00:42:52.830 --> 00:42:54.630
and things like that.

00:42:54.630 --> 00:42:56.500
So it's pretty exciting.

00:42:56.500 --> 00:43:00.040
ALAN SEALES: So we are right
at 2:45, if you've got to--

00:43:00.040 --> 00:43:02.330
Ted's got a call with
Japan, I think.

00:43:02.330 --> 00:43:05.210
You've got to go.

00:43:05.210 --> 00:43:06.210
SANTINO FONTANA: If you
want, we could stay.

00:43:06.210 --> 00:43:06.570
ALAN SEALES: Yeah.

00:43:06.570 --> 00:43:07.900
Laura, you've got to
go too, right?

00:43:07.900 --> 00:43:08.820
LAURA OSNES: I do,
unfortunately.

00:43:08.820 --> 00:43:09.570
ALAN SEALES: Yeah.

00:43:09.570 --> 00:43:10.820
ANN HARADA: But we'll stay.

00:43:13.320 --> 00:43:14.160
SANTINO FONTANA: Suddenly,
there's lots

00:43:14.160 --> 00:43:15.460
of interest in questions.

00:43:15.460 --> 00:43:16.870
ALAN SEALES: Yes, yes.

00:43:16.870 --> 00:43:18.320
LAURA OSNES: Thanks,
everybody.

00:43:18.320 --> 00:43:19.802
ALAN SEALES: Yes, thank
you so much.

00:43:27.500 --> 00:43:29.890
So if you are asking questions,
come see me

00:43:29.890 --> 00:43:35.080
afterwards, and I'll give you
some swag, You've been waiting

00:43:35.080 --> 00:43:36.990
for a while.

00:43:36.990 --> 00:43:40.490
AUDIENCE: Actually, I was
thinking about having seen all

00:43:40.490 --> 00:43:44.350
three incarnations, from the
Julie Andrews version to the

00:43:44.350 --> 00:43:48.060
Lesley Ann Warren version
to this version.

00:43:48.060 --> 00:43:50.590
The character has stayed the
same, but society has changed.

00:43:50.590 --> 00:43:54.060
And it interests me what, I
guess, the bookwriter was told

00:43:54.060 --> 00:43:58.170
in how to make it something
that's accessible to girls in

00:43:58.170 --> 00:44:02.890
the 21st century as opposed to
girls just post-World War II.

00:44:02.890 --> 00:44:05.265
But I guess there's nobody there
who can answer this.

00:44:05.265 --> 00:44:08.410
SANTINO FONTANA: No,
that's Douglas.

00:44:08.410 --> 00:44:11.340
At the core of Cinderella's
story is that somebody comes

00:44:11.340 --> 00:44:14.910
from seemingly nothing
and has something.

00:44:14.910 --> 00:44:17.880
And there's also romance tied
in there, that somebody is

00:44:17.880 --> 00:44:20.810
needed on a personal level
with somebody else.

00:44:20.810 --> 00:44:23.030
That's kind of the core story.

00:44:23.030 --> 00:44:28.690
And I think Doug, he had
political stuff that he wanted

00:44:28.690 --> 00:44:31.830
to play, because he wanted to
expand those characters.

00:44:31.830 --> 00:44:35.080
And suddenly Jean Michel popped
into his head and

00:44:35.080 --> 00:44:36.240
everybody's feelings
about that.

00:44:36.240 --> 00:44:37.450
And also, I think he
dealt with the

00:44:37.450 --> 00:44:38.430
prince as a human being.

00:44:38.430 --> 00:44:40.550
If the prince is a prince,
a huge part of

00:44:40.550 --> 00:44:42.400
his life is the kingdom.

00:44:42.400 --> 00:44:44.800
So to not deal with it in those
other versions in any

00:44:44.800 --> 00:44:48.090
political or social way is kind
of cutting the prince off

00:44:48.090 --> 00:44:49.070
at the knees.

00:44:49.070 --> 00:44:51.970
And so in engaging with that,
he suddenly had a bunch of

00:44:51.970 --> 00:44:54.580
stuff to play with, I think.

00:44:54.580 --> 00:44:59.670
ANN HARADA: And in terms of
Cinderella's change, I think

00:44:59.670 --> 00:45:04.410
what Robyn felt and what Doug
felt was that Cinderella needs

00:45:04.410 --> 00:45:09.260
to be able to help the prince
just as much as he helps her.

00:45:09.260 --> 00:45:13.930
That they will be a marriage
of equals, not he

00:45:13.930 --> 00:45:15.450
is elevating her.

00:45:15.450 --> 00:45:17.680
Yes, of course, he is elevating
her socially and

00:45:17.680 --> 00:45:22.490
economically, but that as
people, it's not just like,

00:45:22.490 --> 00:45:26.430
you're super pretty in a white
dress, let's get married,

00:45:26.430 --> 00:45:30.330
which is sort of the
undercurrent of all previous

00:45:30.330 --> 00:45:32.030
versions of "Cinderella."

00:45:32.030 --> 00:45:36.660
This is, oh, we have something
in common.

00:45:36.660 --> 00:45:39.660
We share something.

00:45:39.660 --> 00:45:40.380
I can talk to you.

00:45:40.380 --> 00:45:41.790
I can't talk to anybody else.

00:45:41.790 --> 00:45:42.450
Do you know what I mean?

00:45:42.450 --> 00:45:44.830
There's that connection in this
version that we're trying

00:45:44.830 --> 00:45:47.580
so hard for girls to see.

00:45:47.580 --> 00:45:48.090
No, look.

00:45:48.090 --> 00:45:48.360
See?

00:45:48.360 --> 00:45:51.490
It's not just enough he's
cute and he's rich.

00:45:51.490 --> 00:45:54.640
You have to care about that
he's a good person, and he

00:45:54.640 --> 00:45:56.490
cares that you're
a good person.

00:45:56.490 --> 00:45:58.170
That's part of it.

00:45:58.170 --> 00:45:59.960
SANTINO FONTANA: And thank God
that he did that, because I

00:45:59.960 --> 00:46:02.180
think there are a lot of people
who do come up and say,

00:46:02.180 --> 00:46:06.370
thank you so much for not making
my daughter want to

00:46:06.370 --> 00:46:09.340
wear a tiara with the wish that
she'll meet some guy who

00:46:09.340 --> 00:46:10.320
will just sweep her
off her feet and

00:46:10.320 --> 00:46:11.798
everything will be fine.

00:46:11.798 --> 00:46:14.088
But it goes farther.

00:46:14.088 --> 00:46:15.920
ALAN SEALES: Over here?

00:46:15.920 --> 00:46:16.300
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:46:16.300 --> 00:46:18.060
I just wanted to say I think
you guys are amazing.

00:46:18.060 --> 00:46:20.380
I saw the show also,
and it was great.

00:46:20.380 --> 00:46:21.800
I'm going to deviate
from all the

00:46:21.800 --> 00:46:23.660
Cinderella version questions.

00:46:23.660 --> 00:46:26.210
And I know you guys were talking
about how 11:00 AM's

00:46:26.210 --> 00:46:27.360
kind of early.

00:46:27.360 --> 00:46:30.170
And for us here, 11:00
AM's kind of late.

00:46:30.170 --> 00:46:31.760
I mean, it's not late.

00:46:31.760 --> 00:46:32.800
People come in at 11:00 AM.

00:46:32.800 --> 00:46:33.370
It's possible.

00:46:33.370 --> 00:46:34.740
But I was just wondering,
I guess, what your

00:46:34.740 --> 00:46:37.120
typical day is like.

00:46:37.120 --> 00:46:38.990
I know sometimes you guys
have two-show days

00:46:38.990 --> 00:46:39.920
versus one-show days.

00:46:39.920 --> 00:46:42.550
What is it like to be living
the Broadway--

00:46:42.550 --> 00:46:43.410
MARLA MINDELLE: The
Broadway dream?

00:46:43.410 --> 00:46:44.820
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:46:44.820 --> 00:46:47.790
MARLA MINDELLE: Well, we have
eight shows a week, so Sunday

00:46:47.790 --> 00:46:51.540
nights and Mondays
are our weekends.

00:46:51.540 --> 00:46:54.540
And I always say, when you
guys are coming home from

00:46:54.540 --> 00:46:55.690
work, we're always
going to work.

00:46:55.690 --> 00:46:59.085
So we're on a completely
opposite schedule.

00:46:59.085 --> 00:47:01.740
We end usually around
like 10:00 or 11:00.

00:47:01.740 --> 00:47:03.760
And then you've got to wind
down, so then it's like 2:00

00:47:03.760 --> 00:47:05.280
AM, and you're going to bed.

00:47:05.280 --> 00:47:08.110
You're waking up at around
like 10:30 or 11:00.

00:47:08.110 --> 00:47:09.420
That's early for us.

00:47:09.420 --> 00:47:11.840
And then you either have another
show, or you have an

00:47:11.840 --> 00:47:14.340
audition that you have
to prepare for, or

00:47:14.340 --> 00:47:15.680
you go to the gym.

00:47:15.680 --> 00:47:17.700
Your daytime is your
free time, but you

00:47:17.700 --> 00:47:18.930
always have the show.

00:47:18.930 --> 00:47:20.440
I mean, at least I do anyway.

00:47:20.440 --> 00:47:22.310
It's always about getting to the
show and making sure that

00:47:22.310 --> 00:47:24.380
I'm eating the right things
for the show.

00:47:24.380 --> 00:47:25.890
That I have enough rest
for the show.

00:47:25.890 --> 00:47:30.340
That I feel well enough
to do the show.

00:47:30.340 --> 00:47:31.010
Yeah.

00:47:31.010 --> 00:47:31.620
Anyone else?

00:47:31.620 --> 00:47:35.380
ANN HARADA: I have a kid,
so I get up early.

00:47:35.380 --> 00:47:38.590
MARLA MINDELLE: How early?

00:47:38.590 --> 00:47:41.010
ANN HARADA: Well, now that he's
older, it's really good,

00:47:41.010 --> 00:47:43.760
because I can leave out a bowl
of cereal the night before and

00:47:43.760 --> 00:47:45.410
tell him, your milk
is in the fridge.

00:47:45.410 --> 00:47:49.880
Just get it out of the door, and
that buys me an extra 20

00:47:49.880 --> 00:47:52.320
minutes in the morning
if he can do that.

00:47:52.320 --> 00:47:54.830
Do you know what I mean?

00:47:54.830 --> 00:47:57.870
But I still have to throw his
clothes at him and make sure

00:47:57.870 --> 00:47:59.320
he brushes his teeth
and stuff.

00:47:59.320 --> 00:48:02.130
And then I take him to camp or
school or whatever the heck it

00:48:02.130 --> 00:48:05.820
is first thing in the morning
that children do.

00:48:05.820 --> 00:48:08.890
And then I come home, and
I try to take a nap,

00:48:08.890 --> 00:48:10.210
because I've died.

00:48:10.210 --> 00:48:12.740
Because I'm on Marla's
schedule.

00:48:12.740 --> 00:48:14.440
I can't just go right to
bed after the show.

00:48:14.440 --> 00:48:17.060
I have to eat and unwind
and whatever.

00:48:17.060 --> 00:48:18.260
And so it's 2 o'clock.

00:48:18.260 --> 00:48:18.940
MARLA MINDELLE: Watch
reality TV.

00:48:18.940 --> 00:48:19.900
SANTINO FONTANA: Talk
about yesterday.

00:48:19.900 --> 00:48:20.455
Tell them about yesterday.

00:48:20.455 --> 00:48:20.730
ANN HARADA: Oh.

00:48:20.730 --> 00:48:24.210
So yesterday, we had an
appearance on the "Live with

00:48:24.210 --> 00:48:29.180
Kelly and Michael Show," which
meant that me and some of the

00:48:29.180 --> 00:48:31.110
other women in the ensemble
had to be at

00:48:31.110 --> 00:48:33.120
the studio at 7:15.

00:48:33.120 --> 00:48:33.760
AUDIENCE: In the morning.

00:48:33.760 --> 00:48:35.440
ANN HARADA: AM.

00:48:35.440 --> 00:48:36.840
MARLA MINDELLE: Which is
unacceptable for us.

00:48:36.840 --> 00:48:38.720
ANN HARADA: It is
not a good time.

00:48:38.720 --> 00:48:40.500
AUDIENCE: That's early
for us too.

00:48:40.500 --> 00:48:42.160
ANN HARADA: Right, that would
be early for anybody.

00:48:42.160 --> 00:48:44.700
And when they do "The Today
Show," it's like a 5:30 call.

00:48:44.700 --> 00:48:45.740
SANTINO FONTANA: And
we had two shows.

00:48:45.740 --> 00:48:46.710
ANN HARADA: Yes, then
we had two shows.

00:48:46.710 --> 00:48:50.650
So then we did that first thing
in the morning, and then

00:48:50.650 --> 00:48:52.380
I went to the theater, tried
to take a little nap.

00:48:52.380 --> 00:48:54.630
Then we had show one
at 2 o'clock.

00:48:54.630 --> 00:48:56.110
Then we had show two at 7:30.

00:48:56.110 --> 00:49:00.160
By the end of the day,
literally, I was dead, fried.

00:49:00.160 --> 00:49:02.090
I had no concept of time.

00:49:02.090 --> 00:49:03.960
I did not know where I was.

00:49:03.960 --> 00:49:06.400
But that's sort of what it is.

00:49:06.400 --> 00:49:12.290
You try to sleep when you can
sleep, and you have your life.

00:49:12.290 --> 00:49:12.870
Everybody's the same.

00:49:12.870 --> 00:49:16.170
We all have our things outside
of work that take up our time

00:49:16.170 --> 00:49:20.920
that we need to get done and
then also do our jobs.

00:49:20.920 --> 00:49:24.370
We, as actors, tend to push more
toward later in the day,

00:49:24.370 --> 00:49:26.890
because that's when we work.

00:49:26.890 --> 00:49:28.270
HARRIET HARRIS: But when
you get older, you

00:49:28.270 --> 00:49:29.380
can't sleep that late.

00:49:29.380 --> 00:49:32.480
So I wake up at 6:20,
and I stay quiet for

00:49:32.480 --> 00:49:33.490
as much as I can.

00:49:33.490 --> 00:49:35.440
I can't sleep past it.

00:49:35.440 --> 00:49:36.760
And I read for a while.

00:49:36.760 --> 00:49:40.290
I have birds, so I try to be
very quiet so the birds don't

00:49:40.290 --> 00:49:44.580
wake up and I don't wake
up my sweetheart.

00:49:44.580 --> 00:49:48.750
And then around 8:30, if they
aren't all awake, then they

00:49:48.750 --> 00:49:50.000
have get up.

00:49:52.540 --> 00:49:55.940
Because my day has to
begin at some point.

00:49:55.940 --> 00:49:58.830
But it's a very difficult
schedule.

00:49:58.830 --> 00:50:01.840
TV's a much easier schedule,
because I wake up early.

00:50:01.840 --> 00:50:04.400
And in California, I wake up,
and I have a cup of coffee.

00:50:04.400 --> 00:50:06.980
And I'm going out, and I'm
smashing aphids on my roses

00:50:06.980 --> 00:50:09.720
and doing interesting things
that occupy my time.

00:50:09.720 --> 00:50:15.030
In New York, I'm sitting in my
room, trying to turn the page

00:50:15.030 --> 00:50:16.280
ever so quietly.

00:50:19.710 --> 00:50:20.100
ALAN SEALES: Cool.

00:50:20.100 --> 00:50:21.100
Yeah, over here?

00:50:21.100 --> 00:50:21.760
AUDIENCE: OK, so side note--

00:50:21.760 --> 00:50:23.930
I'm still mourning "Smash," and
I'm so excited so see this

00:50:23.930 --> 00:50:26.350
other side of your
acting today.

00:50:26.350 --> 00:50:27.760
ANN HARADA: You're so sweet.

00:50:27.760 --> 00:50:30.620
AUDIENCE: Second of all, you're
all so casually talking

00:50:30.620 --> 00:50:31.305
about auditioning.

00:50:31.305 --> 00:50:33.760
And in the corporate world, it's
like, oh, I'm tiptoeing

00:50:33.760 --> 00:50:35.990
out at lunch hour to
go on an interview.

00:50:35.990 --> 00:50:38.950
So is it very normal for you
to just be auditioning for

00:50:38.950 --> 00:50:41.256
other projects while you're
working on this?

00:50:41.256 --> 00:50:42.460
SANTINO FONTANA: Well, they're
all different.

00:50:42.460 --> 00:50:44.420
I mean, the audition I was
talking about the other day,

00:50:44.420 --> 00:50:45.950
they're voiceovers.

00:50:45.950 --> 00:50:47.840
I'm the voice of Excedrin.

00:50:47.840 --> 00:50:50.360
"Headaches are where
Excedrin excels."

00:50:50.360 --> 00:50:51.610
ALAN SEALES: That's you?

00:50:54.170 --> 00:50:55.150
SANTINO FONTANA: Google
it, please.

00:50:55.150 --> 00:50:56.140
Go buy some Excedrin.

00:50:56.140 --> 00:50:58.660
It'll help me.

00:50:58.660 --> 00:51:01.190
So that doesn't conflict, and
there are also things that

00:51:01.190 --> 00:51:03.690
work around your schedule
that don't conflict.

00:51:03.690 --> 00:51:07.820
And some things you audition
for, and they won't happen

00:51:07.820 --> 00:51:09.260
until next year.

00:51:09.260 --> 00:51:11.860
Or a writer wants to meet with
you because they have an idea

00:51:11.860 --> 00:51:15.150
for a part that they're
looking to do in 2015.

00:51:15.150 --> 00:51:17.170
So you can go out and do that.

00:51:17.170 --> 00:51:20.210
I mean, we all know the nature
of theater is it

00:51:20.210 --> 00:51:21.120
comes and it goes.

00:51:21.120 --> 00:51:23.560
So you're always looking
forward.

00:51:23.560 --> 00:51:24.890
MARLA MINDELLE: You're always
looking for the next job, even

00:51:24.890 --> 00:51:25.720
when you have a job.

00:51:25.720 --> 00:51:27.240
SANTINO FONTANA: Which doesn't
mean you're going to take the

00:51:27.240 --> 00:51:27.860
other one either.

00:51:27.860 --> 00:51:28.410
MARLA MINDELLE: Right.

00:51:28.410 --> 00:51:31.070
SANTINO FONTANA: But you know.

00:51:31.070 --> 00:51:32.080
HARRIET HARRIS: And we
have a contract.

00:51:32.080 --> 00:51:33.770
We know how long the
contract is.

00:51:33.770 --> 00:51:38.010
And we don't know if the show
extends beyond the contract if

00:51:38.010 --> 00:51:40.210
that will impact on
our lives or not.

00:51:40.210 --> 00:51:44.480
So you do have to keep an eye
towards the future, because

00:51:44.480 --> 00:51:47.210
you can't depend on
anything, really.

00:51:47.210 --> 00:51:50.400
Google's probably going
to be here tomorrow.

00:51:50.400 --> 00:51:51.070
ANN HARADA: Show business,
not so much.

00:51:51.070 --> 00:51:52.260
MARLA MINDELLE: "Cinderella"
will be too.

00:51:52.260 --> 00:51:54.650
HARRIET HARRIS: Sure, but--

00:51:54.650 --> 00:51:56.580
ALAN SEALES: I guess worst case,
knock on chair, that a

00:51:56.580 --> 00:51:59.270
show unexpectedly gets canceled,
that ends your

00:51:59.270 --> 00:52:01.720
contract early, and you
have no control.

00:52:01.720 --> 00:52:02.410
ANN HARADA: Correct.

00:52:02.410 --> 00:52:04.820
ALAN SEALES: So you've got to
be doing the next thing.

00:52:04.820 --> 00:52:06.710
MARLA MINDELLE: We've
been very fortunate.

00:52:06.710 --> 00:52:07.730
Who doesn't love Cinderella?

00:52:07.730 --> 00:52:08.770
Who doesn't want to
come see the show?

00:52:08.770 --> 00:52:12.100
And every child wants their
family to take it, so our

00:52:12.100 --> 00:52:13.590
ticket sales have been doing--

00:52:13.590 --> 00:52:13.990
SANTINO FONTANA: Very well.

00:52:13.990 --> 00:52:14.640
MARLA MINDELLE: Yeah.

00:52:14.640 --> 00:52:16.040
Very, very well,
which is great.

00:52:16.040 --> 00:52:19.690
Which means that we have
a job for at least--

00:52:19.690 --> 00:52:20.830
well, we have what?

00:52:20.830 --> 00:52:21.380
A year contract?

00:52:21.380 --> 00:52:21.980
ANN HARADA: Mm hmm.

00:52:21.980 --> 00:52:23.680
MARLA MINDELLE: So we started
in January, which means that

00:52:23.680 --> 00:52:25.270
this January, our contract
will be up.

00:52:25.270 --> 00:52:29.330
And we can choose to re-sign
or we can choose to end the

00:52:29.330 --> 00:52:30.270
contract and look for
the next thing.

00:52:30.270 --> 00:52:30.905
ANN HARADA: Or they
could get fire us.

00:52:30.905 --> 00:52:31.720
SANTINO FONTANA: Yeah.

00:52:31.720 --> 00:52:33.520
MARLA MINDELLE: Or
we can get fired.

00:52:33.520 --> 00:52:34.343
I don't think that's
going happen.

00:52:34.343 --> 00:52:35.190
I hope not.

00:52:35.190 --> 00:52:37.230
ALAN SEALES: Over here?

00:52:37.230 --> 00:52:38.432
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:52:38.432 --> 00:52:40.880
OK, my question is
kind of cliche.

00:52:40.880 --> 00:52:44.370
But if you could give one piece
of advice to people who

00:52:44.370 --> 00:52:48.170
want to do this for a living,
what would it be?

00:52:48.170 --> 00:52:48.800
ALAN SEALES: She's a visitor.

00:52:48.800 --> 00:52:49.120
She's not a Googler.

00:52:49.120 --> 00:52:50.370
I looked.

00:52:52.310 --> 00:52:54.020
SANTINO FONTANA: I
was gonna say.

00:52:54.020 --> 00:52:54.960
MARLA MINDELLE: Going
on secret job

00:52:54.960 --> 00:52:56.210
interviews/auditions?

00:52:59.450 --> 00:53:00.963
Oh, gosh, we all have
such different,

00:53:00.963 --> 00:53:04.350
different pieces of advice.

00:53:04.350 --> 00:53:09.360
I always talk about going
to a good college.

00:53:09.360 --> 00:53:11.778
But if you haven't gone to
a good college, oof.

00:53:14.300 --> 00:53:15.700
Well, you know what I mean.

00:53:15.700 --> 00:53:16.695
Like if you went for
accounting--

00:53:16.695 --> 00:53:17.600
SANTINO FONTANA: And
just it's over.

00:53:17.600 --> 00:53:20.350
Just kill the dream.

00:53:20.350 --> 00:53:21.930
ALAN SEALES: Let me see if
I can lead you guys here.

00:53:21.930 --> 00:53:23.980
In my experience--

00:53:23.980 --> 00:53:26.100
I used to perform to as
well, and that's why I

00:53:26.100 --> 00:53:27.530
breathe them in--

00:53:27.530 --> 00:53:29.900
the people I see succeed over
those who don't are those who

00:53:29.900 --> 00:53:32.170
know how to market themselves.

00:53:32.170 --> 00:53:33.360
MARLA MINDELLE: Interesting.

00:53:33.360 --> 00:53:35.260
ANN HARADA: I don't see
it that way at all.

00:53:35.260 --> 00:53:36.570
SANTINO FONTANA: I have
to say, I am a

00:53:36.570 --> 00:53:37.860
terrible marketer of myself.

00:53:37.860 --> 00:53:38.750
ANN HARADA: He sucks.

00:53:38.750 --> 00:53:39.560
SANTINO FONTANA: I'm terrible.

00:53:39.560 --> 00:53:41.350
I'd rather be like,
I'm two steps away

00:53:41.350 --> 00:53:42.565
from a homeless person.

00:53:42.565 --> 00:53:44.390
Just put me in a corner
with some food.

00:53:44.390 --> 00:53:45.510
Just leave me alone.

00:53:45.510 --> 00:53:48.740
I'm a terrible marketer
of myself.

00:53:48.740 --> 00:53:50.620
I understand your commenting
that you

00:53:50.620 --> 00:53:51.660
feel like it's cliche.

00:53:51.660 --> 00:53:54.360
The answer is somewhat
cliche, sadly.

00:53:54.360 --> 00:53:57.660
First of all, you've just got
to do it, and the operative

00:53:57.660 --> 00:54:00.160
word there is "do." So if you
want to be an actor, you've

00:54:00.160 --> 00:54:01.180
got to be acting.

00:54:01.180 --> 00:54:03.120
And that doesn't mean
necessarily on Broadway.

00:54:03.120 --> 00:54:05.570
That means in a class.

00:54:05.570 --> 00:54:09.460
Because identifying what you
want to do is, first of all,

00:54:09.460 --> 00:54:11.460
honing in on what that really
specifically means.

00:54:11.460 --> 00:54:14.140
I was talking to a student who
asked, I want to do what

00:54:14.140 --> 00:54:14.780
you're doing.

00:54:14.780 --> 00:54:15.640
How do I do that?

00:54:15.640 --> 00:54:17.720
And I was like, well, what
do you want to do?

00:54:17.720 --> 00:54:20.240
I want to be an actor.

00:54:20.240 --> 00:54:22.350
So you want to tell stories
as characters?

00:54:22.350 --> 00:54:23.020
Yes.

00:54:23.020 --> 00:54:25.330
What kind of stories?

00:54:25.330 --> 00:54:26.090
Well, musicals.

00:54:26.090 --> 00:54:28.430
OK, well, that's very different
than if you want to

00:54:28.430 --> 00:54:30.600
go be in movies or television
or if you want to be in

00:54:30.600 --> 00:54:31.090
straight plays.

00:54:31.090 --> 00:54:32.910
If you want to do classical
theater, you need another

00:54:32.910 --> 00:54:33.530
understanding.

00:54:33.530 --> 00:54:36.540
You need to be able
to do verse.

00:54:36.540 --> 00:54:39.970
There's so many skills that
are potentially required.

00:54:39.970 --> 00:54:42.520
First, what is most important is
to identify what skills do

00:54:42.520 --> 00:54:44.110
you need to go after.

00:54:44.110 --> 00:54:45.950
Because what do you
really want to do?

00:54:45.950 --> 00:54:47.520
What speaks to you?

00:54:47.520 --> 00:54:51.160
And that's easy, because you
can go out and find that.

00:54:51.160 --> 00:54:52.290
And it's a process.

00:54:52.290 --> 00:54:55.290
My biggest advice really would
be to take any sense of

00:54:55.290 --> 00:54:57.670
pressure off of your
shoulders.

00:54:57.670 --> 00:55:01.280
Morgan Freeman was 40 when
he made his first movie.

00:55:01.280 --> 00:55:04.570
James Gandolfini, who just
passed, he didn't come to

00:55:04.570 --> 00:55:06.640
acting until after college.

00:55:06.640 --> 00:55:08.170
There's no rush.

00:55:08.170 --> 00:55:08.950
There's no rush.

00:55:08.950 --> 00:55:11.680
There's 8 million ways to
skin that cat, but you

00:55:11.680 --> 00:55:14.280
have to go after it.

00:55:14.280 --> 00:55:17.060
And you can do that while you're
doing other things.

00:55:17.060 --> 00:55:20.920
ALAN SEALES: If you guys could
do any role from any time

00:55:20.920 --> 00:55:23.340
ever, what would you do?

00:55:23.340 --> 00:55:24.150
MARLA MINDELLE: You
mean Broadway?

00:55:24.150 --> 00:55:26.000
ALAN SEALES: Anything, Well,
yeah, let's stick to Broadway.

00:55:26.000 --> 00:55:27.960
Let's focus this.

00:55:27.960 --> 00:55:28.870
We'll say Broadway.

00:55:28.870 --> 00:55:30.822
MARLA MINDELLE: These are such
hard-hitting questions.

00:55:33.750 --> 00:55:37.040
ALAN SEALES: Let's get to the
meat of the situation, Marla.

00:55:37.040 --> 00:55:38.140
MARLA MINDELLE: Oh, gosh.

00:55:38.140 --> 00:55:38.670
Evita.

00:55:38.670 --> 00:55:41.270
I've always wanted
to be Elphaba--

00:55:41.270 --> 00:55:43.250
just for one week though,
because it seems too hard to

00:55:43.250 --> 00:55:45.330
do for longer than a week.

00:55:45.330 --> 00:55:46.280
ALAN SEALES: Elphaba
from "Wicked."

00:55:46.280 --> 00:55:47.440
MARLA MINDELLE: From "Wicked,"
yes, yes, yes.

00:55:47.440 --> 00:55:51.990
From the Broadway musical
"Wicked." I've wanted to play

00:55:51.990 --> 00:55:55.930
Ann Harada in "Smash"
at one point.

00:55:55.930 --> 00:55:57.240
ALAN SEALES: That want one of
my questions, if you could

00:55:57.240 --> 00:55:58.920
trade with somebody to do
one of their roles.

00:55:58.920 --> 00:55:59.890
MARLA MINDELLE: Oh, definitely
Ann Harada.

00:55:59.890 --> 00:56:01.140
Definitely.

00:56:03.940 --> 00:56:06.740
She's so disgusted.

00:56:06.740 --> 00:56:09.180
ANN HARADA: I don't know.

00:56:09.180 --> 00:56:10.880
I feel like there's some great
roles out there that I don't

00:56:10.880 --> 00:56:15.000
think I personally have the
chops to play, so I wouldn't

00:56:15.000 --> 00:56:17.730
pick those.

00:56:17.730 --> 00:56:20.090
I'd like to play Dolly in
"Hello, Dolly!" I'd like to

00:56:20.090 --> 00:56:21.500
play Mrs. Lovett.

00:56:21.500 --> 00:56:22.750
Harriet has played
Mrs. Lovett.

00:56:22.750 --> 00:56:24.780
I'm very jealous of her.

00:56:24.780 --> 00:56:27.740
I think every musical theater
actress thinks about playing

00:56:27.740 --> 00:56:32.600
Rose in "Gypsy," at least
people of the character

00:56:32.600 --> 00:56:34.860
persuasion do.

00:56:34.860 --> 00:56:35.350
Things like that.

00:56:35.350 --> 00:56:37.540
Those are, to me, mountains
that would be

00:56:37.540 --> 00:56:38.790
great to climb someday.

00:56:41.320 --> 00:56:45.230
But I want to go back to the
previous question about

00:56:45.230 --> 00:56:47.460
marketing yourself.

00:56:47.460 --> 00:56:48.440
It doesn't matter.

00:56:48.440 --> 00:56:50.830
You don't need that.

00:56:50.830 --> 00:56:55.550
You need to get out there, do
stuff with people, do stuff

00:56:55.550 --> 00:56:57.460
with your friends.

00:56:57.460 --> 00:56:58.800
I sort of feel like
that's the way.

00:56:58.800 --> 00:57:00.830
Because only once you start
working with people, they'll

00:57:00.830 --> 00:57:02.040
think of you for
the next thing.

00:57:02.040 --> 00:57:03.290
And it all sort of snowballs.

00:57:06.005 --> 00:57:07.570
You don't all have to play
in the same field.

00:57:07.570 --> 00:57:09.070
I don't need to be
a movie star.

00:57:09.070 --> 00:57:10.980
I don't need to be a TV star.

00:57:10.980 --> 00:57:13.250
I like acting for
acting's sake.

00:57:13.250 --> 00:57:16.450
I'm happy to be in a little box
in the East Village, and

00:57:16.450 --> 00:57:18.310
I'm happy on Broadway.

00:57:18.310 --> 00:57:19.560
Do you know what I mean?

00:57:19.560 --> 00:57:21.410
So to me, it's all the same.

00:57:21.410 --> 00:57:22.760
You're performing, and
you're trying to

00:57:22.760 --> 00:57:25.820
bring truth to something.

00:57:25.820 --> 00:57:29.480
HARRIET HARRIS: And I think
one of the things that

00:57:29.480 --> 00:57:32.780
distinguishes actors is why
they want to be an actor.

00:57:32.780 --> 00:57:35.420
Some people just think, because
I want to perform.

00:57:35.420 --> 00:57:36.660
I want to entertain.

00:57:36.660 --> 00:57:40.390
Or some people say, because I
love that sensation of all

00:57:40.390 --> 00:57:41.010
that attention.

00:57:41.010 --> 00:57:43.080
I like all eyes on the
high board and

00:57:43.080 --> 00:57:44.530
being on the high board.

00:57:44.530 --> 00:57:47.050
I don't mean that.

00:57:47.050 --> 00:57:48.300
I like to tell a story.

00:57:48.300 --> 00:57:49.510
I like to relate to people.

00:57:49.510 --> 00:57:51.880
I'm a little usually of scared
people, unless it's a

00:57:51.880 --> 00:57:53.410
situation like this,
where you're really

00:57:53.410 --> 00:57:55.950
far away from me.

00:57:55.950 --> 00:58:01.290
But it's a great way for me to
communicate ideas that are

00:58:01.290 --> 00:58:03.950
usually formulated
in a much more

00:58:03.950 --> 00:58:06.190
succinct way than I think.

00:58:06.190 --> 00:58:13.800
So it's a chance to engage
and educate and say

00:58:13.800 --> 00:58:15.880
this exists in life.

00:58:15.880 --> 00:58:18.900
And it's a safe way for you to
look at it, and it's a safe

00:58:18.900 --> 00:58:21.080
way for us to talk about it.

00:58:21.080 --> 00:58:22.600
And it's challenging
at the same time.

00:58:22.600 --> 00:58:26.250
So people are actors for all
sorts of different reasons.

00:58:26.250 --> 00:58:32.480
But you really have to, I think,
devote yourself to what

00:58:32.480 --> 00:58:34.130
you expect to get out of it.

00:58:34.130 --> 00:58:37.890
And I think that what Ann was
talking about it being just as

00:58:37.890 --> 00:58:39.260
credible anyplace.

00:58:39.260 --> 00:58:40.210
It's true.

00:58:40.210 --> 00:58:42.580
It doesn't matter.

00:58:42.580 --> 00:58:45.740
Actors generally feel successful
if they're acting.

00:58:45.740 --> 00:58:48.290
And you don't have to make a lot
of money unless your goal

00:58:48.290 --> 00:58:50.910
is to make money, and then you
really shouldn't be an actor.

00:58:50.910 --> 00:58:54.360
You should really be something
else if that's what you need.

00:58:54.360 --> 00:58:56.800
And really, if you really need a
lot of attention, you should

00:58:56.800 --> 00:58:58.740
be something else.

00:58:58.740 --> 00:59:03.380
And I'm not saying you, but
I mean, one should.

00:59:03.380 --> 00:59:07.140
The more you can define what you
expect for it to bring you

00:59:07.140 --> 00:59:11.660
or want to contribute to it
more, like Santino was talking

00:59:11.660 --> 00:59:14.380
about, the more you can define
that, the happier you probably

00:59:14.380 --> 00:59:17.090
will be and the happier
you are as an actor.

00:59:17.090 --> 00:59:21.072
You'll have more longevity,
I think.

00:59:21.072 --> 00:59:21.510
ALAN SEALES: Nice.

00:59:21.510 --> 00:59:24.710
Yes, next question.

00:59:24.710 --> 00:59:25.190
AUDIENCE: Hi, guys.

00:59:25.190 --> 00:59:27.810
I saw the play and I loved it,
so it's really fun to see you

00:59:27.810 --> 00:59:29.170
all in person.

00:59:29.170 --> 00:59:33.180
My question is if you have any
embarrassing onstage moments

00:59:33.180 --> 00:59:36.205
from either "Cinderella" or a
previous role that you'd want

00:59:36.205 --> 00:59:38.192
to share with us.

00:59:38.192 --> 00:59:41.490
MARLA MINDELLE: It's an
ongoing embarrassment.

00:59:41.490 --> 00:59:42.240
SANTINO FONTANA:
Tell the story.

00:59:42.240 --> 00:59:43.250
Tell the story.

00:59:43.250 --> 00:59:43.640
Yesterday.

00:59:43.640 --> 00:59:44.410
HARRIET HARRIS: Yesterday?

00:59:44.410 --> 00:59:45.690
SANTINO FONTANA: Yeah.

00:59:45.690 --> 00:59:46.350
HARRIET HARRIS: All right.

00:59:46.350 --> 00:59:50.880
We're approaching
our 200th show.

00:59:50.880 --> 00:59:54.390
I really love the show, and I
really love everybody in it.

00:59:54.390 --> 00:59:57.270
And possibly I'm sleep deprived,
I don't know.

00:59:57.270 --> 01:00:01.750
But I got to a certain point
in the afternoon and, of

01:00:01.750 --> 01:00:04.450
course, I just couldn't think
of the next word.

01:00:04.450 --> 01:00:05.650
And this does happen.

01:00:05.650 --> 01:00:08.935
It starts happening in your
40s, and it continues.

01:00:11.540 --> 01:00:14.090
So I say, "Oh, isn't it
wonderful how the needy just

01:00:14.090 --> 01:00:19.120
keep on going?" So I had said,
"Isn't it wonderful how the

01:00:19.120 --> 01:00:26.000
needy just keep on moving?"

01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:28.270
So I thought, OK,
that was bad.

01:00:28.270 --> 01:00:29.520
And then I look over,
and Marla's like--

01:00:32.870 --> 01:00:34.340
Because Marla's so young,
she doesn't

01:00:34.340 --> 01:00:35.420
make mistakes on stage.

01:00:35.420 --> 01:00:36.600
MARLA MINDELLE: Not
true, not true.

01:00:36.600 --> 01:00:38.520
HARRIET HARRIS: And Ann is
like, oh, how bad is this

01:00:38.520 --> 01:00:39.960
going to get?

01:00:39.960 --> 01:00:40.690
This could get really bad.

01:00:40.690 --> 01:00:42.210
Harriet's got more
lines to go.

01:00:42.210 --> 01:00:45.670
So anyway, in the evening I
thought, I am tired, but I'm

01:00:45.670 --> 01:00:47.070
not going to make that
mistake again.

01:00:47.070 --> 01:00:49.810
So I got to, "Isn't it wonderful
how the needy just

01:00:49.810 --> 01:00:55.340
keep on--" I couldn't remember
"going." I couldn't remember

01:00:55.340 --> 01:01:00.290
"moving." I just, what is
something like that?

01:01:03.490 --> 01:01:06.320
So it started guess to sound
like a Katharine Hepburn

01:01:06.320 --> 01:01:06.960
impersonation.

01:01:06.960 --> 01:01:12.385
"Isn't it wonderful how the
needy just keep on--"

01:01:12.385 --> 01:01:14.810
And I thought, I'm going to say
"keep on trucking." I know

01:01:14.810 --> 01:01:17.210
it's going to come out, and
it's going be like some R.

01:01:17.210 --> 01:01:19.990
Crumb cartoon where this
guy is going across.

01:01:19.990 --> 01:01:20.920
But I didn't.

01:01:20.920 --> 01:01:25.290
And finally, I came up with
"moving" again, and both Ann

01:01:25.290 --> 01:01:26.830
and Marla sort of looked--

01:01:26.830 --> 01:01:27.350
MARLA MINDELLE: I always
look at her.

01:01:27.350 --> 01:01:29.700
I always smile at her
afterwards, because I want to

01:01:29.700 --> 01:01:32.790
see her break or see if she'll
giggle or something.

01:01:32.790 --> 01:01:35.660
So the next line she said
completely up to the ceiling,

01:01:35.660 --> 01:01:39.540
because she didn't want to
make eye contact with us,

01:01:39.540 --> 01:01:42.170
which then made me
laugh even more.

01:01:42.170 --> 01:01:44.450
HARRIET HARRIS: And it just got
worse and worse, and I was

01:01:44.450 --> 01:01:46.840
so overwhelmed about having
made that mistake.

01:01:46.840 --> 01:01:48.040
And then I came back in.

01:01:48.040 --> 01:01:50.160
In the next scene, I thought,
oh, completely recovered.

01:01:50.160 --> 01:01:50.880
It's fine, fine.

01:01:50.880 --> 01:01:54.520
A few scenes later, well, I run
in with this invitation.

01:01:54.520 --> 01:01:56.170
And now the prince's is
not giving a ball,

01:01:56.170 --> 01:01:57.430
he's giving a banquet.

01:01:57.430 --> 01:01:59.950
And I run in, and I have
to shut the door.

01:01:59.950 --> 01:02:02.635
And I ran, and I went, you
didn't shut the door.

01:02:02.635 --> 01:02:04.495
You gotta go back and
shut the door.

01:02:04.495 --> 01:02:06.820
So I go back and
shut the door.

01:02:06.820 --> 01:02:10.770
And this is a line that I do all
on one breath, because it

01:02:10.770 --> 01:02:13.560
just has to be that way for
there to be a response.

01:02:13.560 --> 01:02:18.130
And so I go back,
and I'm running.

01:02:18.130 --> 01:02:20.350
And the costume's like
40 pounds, so I'm

01:02:20.350 --> 01:02:21.840
running, going back.

01:02:21.840 --> 01:02:22.940
I'm running, shutting
the door.

01:02:22.940 --> 01:02:25.950
And then I lose the invitation,
and the invitation

01:02:25.950 --> 01:02:26.980
flutters out of my hand.

01:02:26.980 --> 01:02:29.515
And I go over, and I'm so
awkward, because I've got this

01:02:29.515 --> 01:02:30.560
huge hoop skirt on.

01:02:30.560 --> 01:02:34.510
So I'm trying to get down, and
I can't get the invitation.

01:02:34.510 --> 01:02:38.070
And then I thought I had it, and
I came up, and it's empty.

01:02:38.070 --> 01:02:41.060
So I had to reach down again,
get the invitation.

01:02:41.060 --> 01:02:43.380
MARLA MINDELLE: And I'm on stage
with her once again,

01:02:43.380 --> 01:02:45.288
watching this entire thing.

01:02:45.288 --> 01:02:48.410
HARRIET HARRIS: It was like my
life is flashing before me.

01:02:48.410 --> 01:02:50.050
MARLA MINDELLE: But you
would never notice it.

01:02:50.050 --> 01:02:52.650
And that's what I love about
it, is that it's so subtle.

01:02:52.650 --> 01:02:54.370
And the only people that can
tell what's happening--

01:02:54.370 --> 01:02:54.900
well, maybe not.

01:02:54.900 --> 01:02:57.584
Maybe not just trying to get the
invitation off the floor.

01:02:57.584 --> 01:02:59.510
HARRIET HARRIS: It was
a little awkward.

01:02:59.510 --> 01:03:00.390
MARLA MINDELLE: But
the prior scene.

01:03:00.390 --> 01:03:05.200
Like the "keep on moving."
No one would

01:03:05.200 --> 01:03:06.260
tell, but we can tell.

01:03:06.260 --> 01:03:10.920
And it's just a flicker of the
eye where you identify, oh,

01:03:10.920 --> 01:03:13.485
that was a little
screw up there.

01:03:13.485 --> 01:03:14.700
I caught you.

01:03:14.700 --> 01:03:16.680
HARRIET HARRIS: Vicky has
gotten stuck in midair a

01:03:16.680 --> 01:03:17.350
couple of times.

01:03:17.350 --> 01:03:19.740
MARLA MINDELLE: Our
set has stopped.

01:03:19.740 --> 01:03:20.290
HARRIET HARRIS: These
things are

01:03:20.290 --> 01:03:21.510
accidents, or they're mistakes.

01:03:21.510 --> 01:03:21.910
ALAN SEALES: The godmother,
Fairy Godmother.

01:03:21.910 --> 01:03:22.090
MARLA MINDELLE: Yeah.

01:03:22.090 --> 01:03:24.380
HARRIET HARRIS: But nothing
horrible really happens other

01:03:24.380 --> 01:03:27.100
than humiliation.

01:03:27.100 --> 01:03:27.735
SANTINO FONTANA: I fell.

01:03:27.735 --> 01:03:29.840
I came in all my armor.

01:03:29.840 --> 01:03:31.720
The very first scene, I come
in in all that armor.

01:03:31.720 --> 01:03:35.210
And I step up on a tree log, and
I pose, and there's a big

01:03:35.210 --> 01:03:37.210
light that hits me,
and trumpets play.

01:03:37.210 --> 01:03:37.790
It was like, yay!

01:03:37.790 --> 01:03:41.020
And I fell.

01:03:41.020 --> 01:03:43.650
That happened yesterday, where
I was like, I'm now--

01:03:43.650 --> 01:03:44.550
nope.

01:03:44.550 --> 01:03:47.646
I just went down and
went back up again.

01:03:47.646 --> 01:03:51.430
Oh, it's terrible, terrible.

01:03:51.430 --> 01:03:52.040
ALAN SEALES: Next question.

01:03:52.040 --> 01:03:54.960
Yeah, I think we're running
pretty close on time here.

01:03:54.960 --> 01:03:56.870
AUDIENCE: Hi, two-part
question.

01:03:56.870 --> 01:03:59.830
One is, what is each of your
favorite Broadway shows?

01:03:59.830 --> 01:04:01.480
It doesn't have to be
one you've been in.

01:04:01.480 --> 01:04:03.290
It could be one that
you've seen.

01:04:03.290 --> 01:04:06.240
And then also, when you are
going and you're in the

01:04:06.240 --> 01:04:10.000
audience seeing a show, you
probably experience it

01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:13.270
differently than we would.

01:04:13.270 --> 01:04:15.830
Are you thinking about what
they're doing backstage?

01:04:15.830 --> 01:04:16.780
What sort of goes through
your mind?

01:04:16.780 --> 01:04:17.120
MARLA MINDELLE: I do.

01:04:17.120 --> 01:04:17.900
I think about that.

01:04:17.900 --> 01:04:20.040
And also, it's a lot like high
school, because it's such a

01:04:20.040 --> 01:04:21.070
small world.

01:04:21.070 --> 01:04:23.890
I feel a lot of joy, because
we see all of

01:04:23.890 --> 01:04:25.160
our friends on stage.

01:04:25.160 --> 01:04:29.470
It's like we know somebody
in almost every show.

01:04:29.470 --> 01:04:32.040
So yeah, it's a fun experience
for me, because I get to see

01:04:32.040 --> 01:04:36.770
the people that I love
doing their thing.

01:04:36.770 --> 01:04:38.030
That's me.

01:04:38.030 --> 01:04:39.340
ALAN SEALES: What's your
favorite show?

01:04:39.340 --> 01:04:40.810
MARLA MINDELLE: Oh, "Ghost
the Musical," which

01:04:40.810 --> 01:04:41.640
only ran for like--

01:04:41.640 --> 01:04:42.090
[APPLAUSE]

01:04:42.090 --> 01:04:42.670
MARLA MINDELLE: Really?

01:04:42.670 --> 01:04:42.930
AUDIENCE: Yes!

01:04:42.930 --> 01:04:43.910
MARLA MINDELLE: Oh my god.

01:04:43.910 --> 01:04:44.870
Everyone hated it.

01:04:44.870 --> 01:04:45.570
I loved it.

01:04:45.570 --> 01:04:46.280
I saw it four times.

01:04:46.280 --> 01:04:48.760
I took him to see it.

01:04:48.760 --> 01:04:49.980
ALAN SEALES: It was
an experience.

01:04:49.980 --> 01:04:52.100
MARLA MINDELLE: It was an
experience, to say the least.

01:04:52.100 --> 01:04:52.740
I loved it.

01:04:52.740 --> 01:04:56.060
But also I love, of course,
"Gypsy": and "Sunday in the

01:04:56.060 --> 01:05:02.020
Park with George." I'm a purist
at heart as well, even

01:05:02.020 --> 01:05:04.890
though I loved "Ghost." But
I like a lot of the

01:05:04.890 --> 01:05:06.340
old-fashioned ones as well.

01:05:06.340 --> 01:05:08.220
That's what I was raised on.

01:05:08.220 --> 01:05:09.770
So all of them?

01:05:09.770 --> 01:05:12.420
I don't know.

01:05:12.420 --> 01:05:15.050
HARRIET HARRIS: I guess my
favorite show I ever saw--

01:05:15.050 --> 01:05:18.590
and I don't think that's really
true anymore, but it

01:05:18.590 --> 01:05:23.430
may as well be true, because
it's the one that hit me most

01:05:23.430 --> 01:05:24.520
viscerally--

01:05:24.520 --> 01:05:27.490
was the "Sweeney Todd" that
Angela Lansbury and I saw Len

01:05:27.490 --> 01:05:29.000
Cariou too do it.

01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:32.340
And it was wonderful.

01:05:32.340 --> 01:05:34.940
I loved that show.

01:05:34.940 --> 01:05:39.820
But sometimes I go see things
now, and the things that I'm

01:05:39.820 --> 01:05:44.020
most thrilled by is not what
the audience adores.

01:05:44.020 --> 01:05:47.130
Because sometimes I just think
the audience expects so much

01:05:47.130 --> 01:05:53.190
now, and they don't always
recognize that this incredible

01:05:53.190 --> 01:05:54.760
little thing just happened.

01:05:54.760 --> 01:05:56.880
And people don't know how
hard that incredible

01:05:56.880 --> 01:05:58.120
little thing is.

01:05:58.120 --> 01:06:00.970
And sometimes it's just two
actors talking to each other

01:06:00.970 --> 01:06:06.400
for a few moments, and the
whole stage just seems to

01:06:06.400 --> 01:06:10.250
vibrate and shimmer, because
they're so incredibly good.

01:06:10.250 --> 01:06:13.570
And you just think, I hope that
everybody's getting that.

01:06:13.570 --> 01:06:15.710
But it's not the thing
that people leap

01:06:15.710 --> 01:06:17.650
up and go wow about.

01:06:17.650 --> 01:06:21.810
And I kind of think, well, why
aren't we leaping up and going

01:06:21.810 --> 01:06:23.520
wow about that stuff?

01:06:23.520 --> 01:06:28.930
That to me is real artistry
and so beautiful.

01:06:28.930 --> 01:06:31.790
So that's what I get excited
about most of the time, those

01:06:31.790 --> 01:06:32.810
sort of times.

01:06:32.810 --> 01:06:35.290
ANN HARADA: My favorite show
was also that production of

01:06:35.290 --> 01:06:39.820
"Sweeney Todd" that I saw
the day it won the Tony.

01:06:39.820 --> 01:06:47.520
And "Nicholas Nickleby," the
Royal Shakespeare Company's

01:06:47.520 --> 01:06:49.950
four-hour version of "Nicholas
Nickleby."

01:06:49.950 --> 01:06:50.800
Four and a half hours.

01:06:50.800 --> 01:06:52.050
It was awesome.

01:06:56.070 --> 01:06:56.720
I feel the same way.

01:06:56.720 --> 01:07:01.260
I feel like we go to see shows,
and we are judging them

01:07:01.260 --> 01:07:03.900
from a totally different
perspective almost.

01:07:03.900 --> 01:07:06.770
And so for me, when I see
a particularly amazing

01:07:06.770 --> 01:07:12.800
performance or a scene that
makes my heart go, oh, that

01:07:12.800 --> 01:07:16.970
was perfect, that's what sort
of sticks in my head, as

01:07:16.970 --> 01:07:20.280
opposed to that was
a really cool set.

01:07:20.280 --> 01:07:22.680
I never think that.

01:07:22.680 --> 01:07:24.700
SANTINO FONTANA: Funnily enough,
"Sweeney Todd" is also

01:07:24.700 --> 01:07:26.000
my favorite show.

01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:29.080
And I saw the videotape of the
tour of Angela Lansbury with

01:07:29.080 --> 01:07:30.700
George Hearn back when
I was a kid.

01:07:30.700 --> 01:07:32.480
Someone from my high school
showed it to me, and I thought

01:07:32.480 --> 01:07:34.910
it was incredible.

01:07:34.910 --> 01:07:35.470
So that.

01:07:35.470 --> 01:07:37.730
And I think, yeah, we're
more critical.

01:07:37.730 --> 01:07:40.770
But I think probably the biggest
difference is it's

01:07:40.770 --> 01:07:42.610
just much more casual.

01:07:42.610 --> 01:07:44.170
My parents come, and they're
like, oh, we've

01:07:44.170 --> 01:07:44.950
got to go get dressed.

01:07:44.950 --> 01:07:46.230
I'm like, no you don't.

01:07:46.230 --> 01:07:48.310
I'll go wearing whatever.

01:07:48.310 --> 01:07:50.690
It's just much more like, and
now we're going to see a play.

01:07:50.690 --> 01:07:51.920
We're going to go.

01:07:51.920 --> 01:07:54.350
I think that's probably the
biggest difference.

01:07:54.350 --> 01:07:57.230
And to be honest, especially
when you're in a long-running

01:07:57.230 --> 01:07:59.820
show like this, the last place
I want to be on my

01:07:59.820 --> 01:08:01.260
day off is a theater.

01:08:01.260 --> 01:08:02.550
So they're like, we've
got tickets.

01:08:02.550 --> 01:08:05.590
I'm like, I don't want
to go to that.

01:08:05.590 --> 01:08:07.520
I'm sure it's great.

01:08:07.520 --> 01:08:08.220
MALE SPEAKER: One more.

01:08:08.220 --> 01:08:09.290
One more, guys.

01:08:09.290 --> 01:08:11.310
ALAN SEALES: Yeah, we've
got one more question.

01:08:11.310 --> 01:08:12.180
Go ahead.

01:08:12.180 --> 01:08:15.180
AUDIENCE: So my first comment
is for Santino.

01:08:15.180 --> 01:08:17.140
I just wanted to say I'm looking
forward to the next

01:08:17.140 --> 01:08:19.040
season of "Submissions Only."

01:08:19.040 --> 01:08:20.390
SANTINO FONTANA: Oh, thanks.

01:08:20.390 --> 01:08:23.850
AUDIENCE: And my question has
to do with the promo video,

01:08:23.850 --> 01:08:26.680
and whose idea was it to
pair Sir Mix-a-Lot with

01:08:26.680 --> 01:08:28.920
"Cindrella"?

01:08:28.920 --> 01:08:29.720
SANTINO FONTANA: Oh,
that's right.

01:08:29.720 --> 01:08:31.010
That was mine.

01:08:31.010 --> 01:08:32.500
That was my idea.

01:08:32.500 --> 01:08:36.740
"Submissions Only" is a web
series that basically got

01:08:36.740 --> 01:08:38.970
started-- for the girl who
was asking about if

01:08:38.970 --> 01:08:40.200
you want to do this--

01:08:40.200 --> 01:08:42.840
a bunch of actors who weren't
working at the time.

01:08:42.840 --> 01:08:44.430
She got a camera.

01:08:44.430 --> 01:08:46.319
She wrote a script, and we just
started doing this show,

01:08:46.319 --> 01:08:51.470
which kind of has had a great
following online.

01:08:51.470 --> 01:08:53.479
And there's three seasons
now that we've shot.

01:08:53.479 --> 01:08:56.120
The third season is
about to come out.

01:08:56.120 --> 01:09:00.120
I had a lot of time in tech,
which is very slow and you're

01:09:00.120 --> 01:09:01.399
working on one scene
at a time.

01:09:01.399 --> 01:09:03.000
And they were doing lights, and
they're doing the set, and

01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:03.819
they're doing costumes.

01:09:03.819 --> 01:09:06.020
So you have a lot of time off.

01:09:06.020 --> 01:09:09.300
And one of the taglines at the
beginning of the marketing of

01:09:09.300 --> 01:09:12.350
"Cinderella" was "Glass slippers
or so back," which

01:09:12.350 --> 01:09:15.319
they were hoping would both
combine the modern sensibility

01:09:15.319 --> 01:09:18.500
that we have but also
the glass slippers.

01:09:18.500 --> 01:09:21.649
And I was thinking of "Baby Got
Back." I was like, I don't

01:09:21.649 --> 01:09:22.750
know why but glass slippers
are back.

01:09:22.750 --> 01:09:26.180
It just got in my head, and I
was like, that'll be fun.

01:09:26.180 --> 01:09:27.080
Let me play around with that.

01:09:27.080 --> 01:09:31.390
So I wrote the lyrics to it,
and it's basically the same

01:09:31.390 --> 01:09:36.300
idea, the same premise that
these people are obsessed with

01:09:36.300 --> 01:09:38.000
this one body feature.

01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:40.340
And in this play, everyone's
obsessed with these shoes,

01:09:40.340 --> 01:09:41.670
these glass shoes.

01:09:41.670 --> 01:09:45.170
So just keeping everybody's
kind of personalities and

01:09:45.170 --> 01:09:48.170
skills in mind, I just
kind of wrote this.

01:09:48.170 --> 01:09:49.990
And then I started seeing
the picture.

01:09:49.990 --> 01:09:51.430
And then Robyn Goodman,
the producer, was

01:09:51.430 --> 01:09:51.763
like, that's great.

01:09:51.763 --> 01:09:53.100
You should make a music
video out of that.

01:09:53.100 --> 01:09:54.680
And then I kind was
like, yeah.

01:09:54.680 --> 01:09:57.180
And I put together kind of a
shot list of, yeah, it could

01:09:57.180 --> 01:09:59.080
be this and this and
this and this.

01:09:59.080 --> 01:10:01.230
And there was a green screen
upstairs, and I was like, we

01:10:01.230 --> 01:10:02.880
could use a green screen.

01:10:02.880 --> 01:10:05.190
And then one thing after
another, and I brought

01:10:05.190 --> 01:10:07.570
everybody up into my dressing
room with my little mic, which

01:10:07.570 --> 01:10:10.140
I do those Excedrin
things on, and had

01:10:10.140 --> 01:10:11.320
everyone record into them.

01:10:11.320 --> 01:10:13.330
And then that was it.

01:10:13.330 --> 01:10:15.470
I had done something similar a
couple years ago with "The

01:10:15.470 --> 01:10:17.980
Importance of Being Earnest." I
did a parody of the "Jersey

01:10:17.980 --> 01:10:21.960
Shore Gone Wilde" videos which
went viral, which was great.

01:10:21.960 --> 01:10:22.650
And I love that.

01:10:22.650 --> 01:10:24.810
I mean, it's just an idea that
pops in my head and like, eh,

01:10:24.810 --> 01:10:26.230
here you go.

01:10:26.230 --> 01:10:28.350
And they were all great for
doing it, and they're all

01:10:28.350 --> 01:10:29.770
brilliant in it.

01:10:29.770 --> 01:10:33.700
It's very hard to get people on
board with something like

01:10:33.700 --> 01:10:36.980
that, because you have an idea,
but it's going to take

01:10:36.980 --> 01:10:39.250
you too long to try
and explain it.

01:10:39.250 --> 01:10:40.610
So you just have to trust.

01:10:40.610 --> 01:10:42.940
I said to Harriet in that first
shot when she's in the

01:10:42.940 --> 01:10:46.440
hallway and she's running, I was
like, all you need to know

01:10:46.440 --> 01:10:48.790
is you're regal and
you're walking.

01:10:48.790 --> 01:10:50.620
That's it, and then
she does the rest.

01:10:50.620 --> 01:10:51.900
And we did like one take,
and we're like, OK.

01:10:51.900 --> 01:10:52.900
That's it.

01:10:52.900 --> 01:10:53.790
Yup, OK.

01:10:53.790 --> 01:10:55.890
And I was editing it during
the show when I was

01:10:55.890 --> 01:10:59.355
backstage on iMovie.

01:10:59.355 --> 01:11:00.300
So yeah.

01:11:00.300 --> 01:11:01.730
ALAN SEALES: Well, I think
we're getting kicked out.

01:11:01.730 --> 01:11:04.070
We're going to lose the room,
so we have to wrap up.

01:11:04.070 --> 01:11:07.510
Gosh, guys, thank you
so much for coming.

01:11:07.510 --> 01:11:08.760
MARLA MINDELLE: Thank you.
