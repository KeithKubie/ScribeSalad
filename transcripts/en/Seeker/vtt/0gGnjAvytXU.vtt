00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:00.860
Fun fact.

00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:04.050
Our brain is so afraid of being
blamed for things that it will

00:00:04.050 --> 00:00:06.970
bend time to stop
it from happening.

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:13.650
I'm Anthony.

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:14.410
This is D News.

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:16.630
And how we perceive
time is connected

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:18.094
to all kinds of things.

00:00:18.094 --> 00:00:20.010
How quickly parts of our
brain can communicate

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:22.360
with each other, our
emotional state, our age.

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:26.650
And now, it turns out, our fear
of getting blamed for stuff.

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:28.770
Sense of agency is
basically your sense

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:31.620
that something you do causes
a change in the outside world.

00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:33.590
So flip a light
switch, light goes on.

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:35.040
You go, hey, I did that!

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:35.890
Agency!

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:39.412
Please actually scream that when
you flip a switch from now on.

00:00:39.412 --> 00:00:40.870
And a new study
shows that the type

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:43.360
of result that you
get from your action

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:46.490
can actually change your
perception of time and mess

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:47.786
with your sense of agency.

00:00:47.786 --> 00:00:49.160
Researchers had
a group of people

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:50.450
press a series of buttons.

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:52.320
Some would give
positive feedback,

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:53.830
some would emit terrible noises.

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:56.040
And when the outcome
was good, the subjects

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:58.540
thought that it happened the
moment they pressed the button.

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:00.980
And when the button press
caused a bad outcome,

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:03.040
the subjects thought
there was a slight delay

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:05.330
between their button
press and the result.

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:06.250
The catch?

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:09.430
Every outcome happened
at the exact same speed.

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:12.090
Your brain speeds up
your perception of time

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:14.100
when you get a good
result, because you

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.560
want to feel directly
connected to it.

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.720
When your actions
have negative results,

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:21.460
your brain spaces the
cause and effect out.

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:24.720
You're trying to distance
yourself from responsibility.

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:27.730
If you push a button and then
slightly later a horrible siren

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:30.880
bothers everyone, I mean,
you just pushed a button.

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:32.280
The button made the noise.

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:36.210
Your mind is shielding you
from the stress and the guilt

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:37.952
associated with doing
something wrong.

00:01:37.952 --> 00:01:40.410
Now the downside of this is
that your brain could literally

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:41.940
trick you into
thinking you weren't

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:44.390
responsible for
something when you were.

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:46.660
It also partially
explains why people

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:49.720
are so quick to take credit
for something positive,

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:51.740
and deny involvement
in something negative.

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:53.900
It's kind of like how
we go from, "No no!

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:56.510
I walked away before the
glass got knocked over.

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:59.220
I couldn't have broken
it." to, "No, that's mine.

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:00.010
I called it first.

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:01.230
I called it way before you."

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:04.020
And of course, some people
are just cowardly jerks.

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:06.570
Science still can't
explain cowardly jerks.

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:09.449
I feel like I've been
letting my brain fool me

00:02:09.449 --> 00:02:11.580
into not taking the
blame for a lot of stuff.

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:12.360
How about you?

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:14.100
Has your brain been
letting other people

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:15.900
take the fall for your actions?

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:19.560
