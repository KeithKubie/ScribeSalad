00:00:00.149 --> 00:00:04.890
Getting naked is usually great .. But not
this time

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:10.660
What’s up guys I’m Sapna here for DNews.

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:15.799
In the movie Everest that came out in 2015..
kind of a spoiler alert but not really and

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:18.770
the movie is based on a true story... but
anyway… so towards the end of the movie

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:23.699
.. one of the guys who was stuck at the top
of Mount Everest overnight in the bitter cold

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:26.050
starts to rip off his coat and outer layers.

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:31.210
That might seem super weird but it’s actually
a documented phenomenon unofficially called

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:33.290
paradoxical undressing.

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:37.820
The reason it’s called “paradoxical undressing”
is because stripping down while you’re freezing

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:42.370
to death is the exact opposite of what we
should instinctively do to protect ourselves

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:43.430
from the cold!

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:47.920
But it happens to some people during extreme
stages of hypothermia.

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:53.010
Hypothermia is when the body temperature dips
to dangerously low levels-- below 95 degrees

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:54.010
Fahrenheit

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:59.400
A study by German researchers in the International
Journal of Legal Medicine looked at 69 cases

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:01.550
of death caused by hypothermia.

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:06.580
They found that 25% of those victims were
partially or completely naked.

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:12.110
And an article in New Scientist suggests that
20 to 50% of people who die from hypothermia

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:14.600
may exhibit signs of this bizarre behavior.

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:20.570
A study in Sweden looked at 33 cases of people
who fit the description based on police reports..

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:24.670
And they found it was pretty much even across
the board in terms of men and women and age

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:25.670
range.

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:28.850
During the later stages of hypothermia…
people are really out of it.

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:29.850
They’re disoriented.

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:33.820
If they were drinking or doing drugs, that
of course may factor into the confused behavior

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:35.400
and bad judgement.

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:40.100
But beyond that … there is another reason
why extremely hypothermic people may take

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:41.390
off all their clothes.

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:44.130
They do it because they actually feel hot.

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:47.210
There are a couple of physiological theories
behind this.

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:52.010
According to a study published back in 1979
in the Journal of Forensic Science... one

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:57.900
possible explanation for paradoxical undressing
is peripheral vasoconstriction.

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:02.350
Peripheral vasoconstriction refers to tight
constricted blood vessels in the outer parts

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:04.290
of the body...like the arms and the legs.

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:08.599
That’s a good thing in extreme cold because
it keeps blood flowing inward to the core

00:02:08.599 --> 00:02:09.599
organs.

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:14.279
But the theory is that when the body becomes
so exhausted from fighting the cold.. the

00:02:14.279 --> 00:02:18.250
tiny muscles that keep peripheral blood vessels
constricted tire out.

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:20.459
So the blood vessels open up..

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:25.189
The blood rushes back to the skin.. and creates
a really hot flushed feeling.

00:02:25.189 --> 00:02:30.060
Another theory is that extreme cold messes
with the brain-- the hypothalamus region in

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:33.819
particular, which is the central command for
body temperature regulation.

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:39.230
If the cold causes the hypothalamus to malfunction…
it may alter signals to the body.. making

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:41.790
you think you’re really hot when you’re
not.

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:45.849
So taking off clothing may seem like a great
idea... even though it’s not.

00:02:45.849 --> 00:02:49.030
There’s one more part to this wacky phenomenon
that I want to tell you.

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:54.239
Just before freezing to death.. humans also
tend to burrow or wedge themselves into a

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:55.620
tight space.

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:58.139
Some call it terminal burrowing behavior.

00:02:58.139 --> 00:03:01.809
That German study we talked about earlier
discovered that the hypothermic people who

00:03:01.809 --> 00:03:06.359
were found partially or completely naked were
also found in a tight space..

00:03:06.359 --> 00:03:09.640
Like underneath a bed, behind a wardrobe or
on a shelf.

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:14.249
A tight space can help minimize heat loss
so unlike getting undressed, this burrowing

00:03:14.249 --> 00:03:15.999
behavior actually makes sense.

00:03:15.999 --> 00:03:19.980
It’s not fully understood but those German
researchers say it’s thought to be triggered

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:22.569
by the brain stem..as a protective measure..

00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:26.870
Kind of like how warm-blooded hibernating
animals burrow into a small, enclosed den

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:27.870
for the winter.

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:30.900

Long before you get to extreme hypothermia,
frostbite is concern.
