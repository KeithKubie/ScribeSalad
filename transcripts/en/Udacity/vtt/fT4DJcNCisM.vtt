00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:03.860
In this lesson we will
discuss memory consistency,

00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:06.510
which determines how
strictly should we enforce

00:00:06.510 --> 00:00:10.370
ordering among accesses to
different memory locations.

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:13.790
This is needed to get what we
expect from our synchronization and

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:16.350
data accesses in
a shared-memory program.
