00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:03.470
Let's do some compound
inequality problems, and these

00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:07.450
are just inequality problems
that have more than one set of

00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:08.060
constraints.

00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:10.020
You're going to see what I'm
talking about in a second.

00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:15.110
So the first problem I have is
negative 5 is less than or

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:22.300
equal to x minus 4, which is
also less than or equal to 13.

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:25.640
So we have two sets of
constraints on the set of x's

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:27.426
that satisfy these equations.

00:00:27.426 --> 00:00:31.270
x minus 4 has to be greater than
or equal to negative 5

00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:36.240
and x minus 4 has to be less
than or equal to 13.

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:40.180
So we could rewrite this
compound inequality as

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:49.040
negative 5 has to be less than
or equal to x minus 4, and x

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:57.800
minus 4 needs to be less
than or equal to 13.

00:00:57.800 --> 00:00:59.990
And then we could solve each of
these separately, and then

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:02.220
we have to remember this "and"
there to think about the

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:05.069
solution set because it has to
be things that satisfy this

00:01:05.069 --> 00:01:07.200
equation and this equation.

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.660
So let's solve each of
them individually.

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:12.430
So this one over here,
we can add 4 to both

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:13.680
sides of the equation.

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:21.840
The left-hand side, negative
5 plus 4, is negative 1.

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:26.120
Negative 1 is less than
or equal to x, right?

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:28.850
These 4's just cancel out here
and you're just left with an x

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:30.620
on this right-hand side.

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:37.120
So the left, this part right
here, simplifies to x needs to

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:40.780
be greater than or equal to
negative 1 or negative 1 is

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:42.280
less than or equal to x.

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:43.580
So we can also write
it like this.

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:46.110
X needs to be greater than
or equal to negative 1.

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:46.950
These are equivalent.

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:48.800
I just swapped the sides.

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:51.506
Now let's do this other
condition here in green.

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:57.910
Let's add 4 to both sides
of this equation.

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:04.330
The left-hand side,
we just get an x.

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:07.380
And then the right-hand
side, we get 13 plus

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:09.840
14, which is 17.

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:13.800
So we get x is less than
or equal to 17.

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:17.970
So our two conditions, x has to
be greater than or equal to

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:22.310
negative 1 and less than
or equal to 17.

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:24.460
So we could write this
again as a compound

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:25.700
inequality if we want.

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:29.470
We can say that the solution
set, that x has to be less

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:34.950
than or equal to 17 and greater
than or equal to

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:35.550
negative 1.

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:38.750
It has to satisfy both
of these conditions.

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:43.676
So what would that look
like on a number line?

00:02:43.676 --> 00:02:46.250
So let's put our number
line right there.

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:48.590
Let's say that this is 17.

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:50.090
Maybe that's 18.

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:51.040
You keep going down.

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:52.180
Maybe this is 0.

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:55.620
I'm obviously skipping a bunch
of stuff in between.

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:58.650
Then we would have a negative
1 right there, maybe a

00:02:58.650 --> 00:02:59.920
negative 2.

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:03.630
So x is greater than or equal
to negative 1, so we would

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:04.610
start at negative 1.

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:07.000
We're going to circle it in
because we have a greater than

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:08.680
or equal to.

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:13.440
And then x is greater than that,
but it has to be less

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:17.580
than or equal to 17.

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:21.170
So it could be equal to
17 or less than 17.

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:23.650
So this right here is a solution
set, everything that

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:25.710
I've shaded in orange.

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:28.850
And if we wanted to write it in
interval notation, it would

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:35.030
be x is between negative 1 and
17, and it can also equal

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:37.120
negative 1, so we put
a bracket, and it

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:39.510
can also equal 17.

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:43.350
So this is the interval notation
for this compound

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:45.330
inequality right there.

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:46.580
Let's do another one.

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:51.980
Let me get a good
problem here.

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:56.620
Let's say that we have
negative 12.

00:03:56.620 --> 00:03:58.640
I'm going to change the problem
a little bit from the

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:00.270
one that I've found here.

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:08.230
Negative 12 is less than 2 minus
5x, which is less than

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:10.230
or equal to 7.

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:12.950
I want to do a problem that has
just the less than and a

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:14.630
less than or equal to.

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:16.709
The problem in the book that
I'm looking at has an equal

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:18.600
sign here, but I want to remove
that intentionally

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:20.500
because I want to show you
when you have a hybrid

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:22.390
situation, when you have
a little bit of both.

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:28.310
So first we can separate this
into two normal inequalities.

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:31.940
You have this inequality
right there.

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:37.530
We know that negative 12 needs
to be less than 2 minus 5x.

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:43.230
That has to be satisfied, and--
let me do it in another

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:46.810
color-- this inequality also
needs to be satisfied.

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:50.740
2 minus 5x has to be less than
7 and greater than 12, less

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:56.530
than or equal to 7 and greater
than negative 12, so and 2

00:04:56.530 --> 00:05:02.140
minus 5x has to be less
than or equal to 7.

00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:05.290
So let's just solve this the
way we solve everything.

00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:08.050
Let's get this 2 onto the
left-hand side here.

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:11.730
So let's subtract 2 from both
sides of this equation.

00:05:11.730 --> 00:05:15.500
So if you subtract 2 from both
sides of this equation, the

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:19.560
left-hand side becomes negative
14, is less than--

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:23.830
these cancel out-- less
than negative 5x.

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:27.140
Now let's divide both
sides by negative 5.

00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:29.360
And remember, when you multiply
or divide by a

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:32.140
negative number, the inequality
swaps around.

00:05:32.140 --> 00:05:35.880
So if you divide both sides by
negative 5, you get a negative

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:39.980
14 over negative 5, and you have
an x on the right-hand

00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:43.140
side, if you divide that by
negative 5, and this swaps

00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:47.920
from a less than sign to
a greater than sign.

00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:53.560
The negatives cancel out, so you
get 14/5 is greater than

00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:58.580
x, or x is less than 14/5,
which is-- what is this?

00:05:58.580 --> 00:06:01.380
This is 2 and 4/5.

00:06:01.380 --> 00:06:04.320
x is less than 2 and 4/5.

00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:08.090
I just wrote this improper
fraction as a mixed number.

00:06:08.090 --> 00:06:10.620
Now let's do the other
constraint

00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:12.630
over here in magenta.

00:06:12.630 --> 00:06:15.210
So let's subtract 2 from both
sides of this equation, just

00:06:15.210 --> 00:06:16.800
like we did before.

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:19.910
And actually, you can do these
simultaneously, but it becomes

00:06:19.910 --> 00:06:20.770
kind of confusing.

00:06:20.770 --> 00:06:23.360
So to avoid careless mistakes, I
encourage you to separate it

00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:24.650
out like this.

00:06:24.650 --> 00:06:27.300
So if you subtract 2 from both
sides of the equation, the

00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:30.680
left-hand side becomes
negative 5x.

00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:33.100
The right-hand side, you have
less than or equal to.

00:06:33.100 --> 00:06:37.620
The right-hand side becomes
7 minus 2, becomes 5.

00:06:37.620 --> 00:06:40.780
Now, you divide both sides
by negative 5.

00:06:40.780 --> 00:06:42.370
On the left-hand side,
you get an x.

00:06:42.370 --> 00:06:46.450
On the right-hand side, 5
divided by negative 5 is

00:06:46.450 --> 00:06:47.600
negative 1.

00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:50.440
And since we divided by a
negative number, we swap the

00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:51.380
inequality.

00:06:51.380 --> 00:06:53.310
It goes from less than or
equal to, to greater

00:06:53.310 --> 00:06:54.610
than or equal to.

00:06:54.610 --> 00:06:56.820
So we have our two
constraints.

00:06:56.820 --> 00:07:01.510
x has to be less than 2 and 4/5,
and it has to be greater

00:07:01.510 --> 00:07:03.720
than or equal to negative 1.

00:07:03.720 --> 00:07:05.600
So we could write
it like this.

00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:10.300
x has to be greater than or
equal to negative 1, so that

00:07:10.300 --> 00:07:13.390
would be the lower bound on our
interval, and it has to be

00:07:13.390 --> 00:07:14.940
less than 2 and 4/5.

00:07:20.720 --> 00:07:22.590
And notice, not less
than or equal to.

00:07:22.590 --> 00:07:24.510
That's why I wanted to show you,
you have the parentheses

00:07:24.510 --> 00:07:26.810
there because it can't be
equal to 2 and 4/5.

00:07:26.810 --> 00:07:29.580
x has to be less
than 2 and 4/5.

00:07:29.580 --> 00:07:31.502
Or we could write this way.

00:07:31.502 --> 00:07:37.010
x has to be less than 2 and
4/5, that's just this

00:07:37.010 --> 00:07:40.540
inequality, swapping the
sides, and it has to be

00:07:40.540 --> 00:07:44.670
greater than or equal
to negative 1.

00:07:44.670 --> 00:07:47.210
So these two statements
are equivalent.

00:07:47.210 --> 00:07:52.040
And if I were to draw it
on a number line, it

00:07:52.040 --> 00:07:53.490
would look like this.

00:07:53.490 --> 00:08:00.410
So you have a negative 1, you
have 2 and 4/5 over here.

00:08:00.410 --> 00:08:01.850
Obviously, you'll have
stuff in between.

00:08:01.850 --> 00:08:03.580
Maybe, you know, 0
sitting there.

00:08:03.580 --> 00:08:06.640
We have to be greater than or
equal to negative 1, so we can

00:08:06.640 --> 00:08:08.100
be equal to negative 1.

00:08:08.100 --> 00:08:10.220
And we're going to be greater
than negative 1, but we also

00:08:10.220 --> 00:08:12.700
have to be less than
2 and 4/5.

00:08:12.700 --> 00:08:14.780
So we can't include
2 and 4/5 there.

00:08:14.780 --> 00:08:18.100
We can't be equal to 2 and 4/5,
so we can only be less

00:08:18.100 --> 00:08:22.590
than, so we put a empty circle
around 2 and 4/5 and then we

00:08:22.590 --> 00:08:24.960
fill in everything below that,
all the way down to negative

00:08:24.960 --> 00:08:27.580
1, and we include negative 1
because we have this less than

00:08:27.580 --> 00:08:29.120
or equal sign.

00:08:29.120 --> 00:08:31.820
So the last two problems I did
are kind of "and" problems.

00:08:31.820 --> 00:08:34.419
You have to meet both of
these constraints.

00:08:34.419 --> 00:08:36.025
Now, let's do an "or" problem.

00:08:38.799 --> 00:08:42.620
So let's say I have these
inequalities.

00:08:42.620 --> 00:08:49.910
Let's say I'm given-- let's say
that 4x minus 1 needs to

00:08:49.910 --> 00:08:58.770
be greater than or equal to
7, or 9x over 2 needs to

00:08:58.770 --> 00:09:00.290
be less than 3.

00:09:00.290 --> 00:09:03.460
So now when we're saying "or,"
an x that would satisfy these

00:09:03.460 --> 00:09:06.400
are x's that satisfy either
of these equations.

00:09:06.400 --> 00:09:09.250
In the last few videos or in the
last few problems, we had

00:09:09.250 --> 00:09:11.770
to find x's that satisfied
both of these equations.

00:09:11.770 --> 00:09:14.260
Here, this is much
more lenient.

00:09:14.260 --> 00:09:16.780
We just have to satisfy
one of these two.

00:09:16.780 --> 00:09:19.140
So let's figure out the solution
sets for both of

00:09:19.140 --> 00:09:21.680
these and then we figure out
essentially their union, their

00:09:21.680 --> 00:09:22.980
combination, all of
the things that'll

00:09:22.980 --> 00:09:25.100
satisfy either of these.

00:09:25.100 --> 00:09:27.010
So on this one, on the one
on the left, we can

00:09:27.010 --> 00:09:29.490
add 1 to both sides.

00:09:29.490 --> 00:09:31.440
You add 1 to both sides.

00:09:31.440 --> 00:09:35.480
The left-hand side just becomes
4x is greater than or

00:09:35.480 --> 00:09:39.840
equal to 7 plus 1 is 8.

00:09:39.840 --> 00:09:42.120
Divide both sides by 4.

00:09:42.120 --> 00:09:46.120
You get x is greater
than or equal to 2.

00:09:46.120 --> 00:09:48.790
Or let's do this one.

00:09:48.790 --> 00:09:51.770
Let's see, if we multiply both
sides of this equation by 2/9,

00:09:51.770 --> 00:09:53.070
what do we get?

00:09:53.070 --> 00:09:56.070
If you multiply both sides by
2/9, it's a positive number,

00:09:56.070 --> 00:09:58.570
so we don't have to do anything
to the inequality.

00:09:58.570 --> 00:10:06.760
These cancel out, and you get
x is less than 3 times 2/9.

00:10:06.760 --> 00:10:10.610
3/9 is the same thing as
1/3, so x needs to

00:10:10.610 --> 00:10:12.460
be less than 2/3.

00:10:12.460 --> 00:10:17.280
So or x is less than 2/3.

00:10:17.280 --> 00:10:18.840
So that's our solution set.

00:10:18.840 --> 00:10:23.240
x needs to be greater than or
equal to 2, or less than 2/3.

00:10:23.240 --> 00:10:24.340
So this is interesting.

00:10:24.340 --> 00:10:27.920
Let me plot the solution
set on the number line.

00:10:31.240 --> 00:10:33.380
So that is our number line.

00:10:33.380 --> 00:10:41.630
Maybe this is 0, this is 1, this
is 2, 3, maybe that is

00:10:41.630 --> 00:10:42.940
negative 1.

00:10:42.940 --> 00:10:46.910
So x can be greater than
or equal to 2.

00:10:46.910 --> 00:10:49.960
So we could start-- let me
do it in another color.

00:10:49.960 --> 00:10:53.320
We can start at 2 here and it
would be greater than or equal

00:10:53.320 --> 00:10:58.690
to 2, so include everything
greater than or equal to 2.

00:10:58.690 --> 00:11:01.530
That's that condition
right there.

00:11:01.530 --> 00:11:03.440
Or x could be less than 2/3.

00:11:06.550 --> 00:11:11.120
So 2/3 is going to be right
around here, right?

00:11:11.120 --> 00:11:13.680
That is 2/3.

00:11:13.680 --> 00:11:16.850
x could be less than 2/3.

00:11:16.850 --> 00:11:19.150
And this is interesting.

00:11:19.150 --> 00:11:21.490
Because if we pick one of these
numbers, it's going to

00:11:21.490 --> 00:11:23.020
satisfy this inequality.

00:11:23.020 --> 00:11:24.840
If we pick one of these numbers,
it's going to satisfy

00:11:24.840 --> 00:11:25.850
that inequality.

00:11:25.850 --> 00:11:28.500
If we had an "and" here, there
would have been no numbers

00:11:28.500 --> 00:11:32.420
that satisfy it because you
can't be both greater than 2

00:11:32.420 --> 00:11:34.630
and less than 2/3.

00:11:34.630 --> 00:11:37.020
So the only way that there's
any solution set here is

00:11:37.020 --> 00:11:40.740
because it's "or." You can
satisfy one of the two

00:11:40.740 --> 00:11:41.920
inequalities.

00:11:41.920 --> 00:11:44.480
Anyway, hopefully you,
found that fun.
