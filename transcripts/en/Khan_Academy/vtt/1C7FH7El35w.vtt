00:00:01.009 --> 00:00:01.973
Ed: Hello, everyone.

00:00:01.973 --> 00:00:03.845
Good evening.

00:00:03.845 --> 00:00:08.511
I'd like to welcome
you to the - (laughter)

00:00:08.511 --> 00:00:10.645
The MIT Club of California.

00:00:10.645 --> 00:00:14.452
Tonight, we have an excellent,
distinguished speaker,

00:00:14.452 --> 00:00:17.922
but before we introduce
him, I hope you have enjoyed

00:00:17.922 --> 00:00:20.479
the sandwiches and cookies.

00:00:20.479 --> 00:00:21.728
We learned to make those ourselves

00:00:21.728 --> 00:00:27.480
by watching one of
Sal's videos. (laughter)

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:31.068
Just kidding, they're
from Subway. (laughter)

00:00:34.224 --> 00:00:38.218
Let me read a bio for Sal.

00:00:39.198 --> 00:00:42.318
Sal is a social entrepreneur who
has become an internet sensation

00:00:42.318 --> 00:00:44.817
and inspiration for his fun

00:00:44.817 --> 00:00:47.984
and highly effective
educational videos on YouTube.

00:00:47.984 --> 00:00:49.942
Every month, more than 100,000 students,

00:00:49.942 --> 00:00:52.543
both young and old, across the globe,

00:00:52.543 --> 00:00:57.649
use his over 1,300 free videos
to learn about arithmetics,

00:00:57.649 --> 00:01:01.885
finance, chemistry,
(unintelligible) calculus.

00:01:01.885 --> 00:01:04.122
He founded the Khan Academy,
which was recently covered

00:01:04.122 --> 00:01:11.400
on CNN, PBS News, NPR, San Francisco
Chronicle, and NBC Nightline.

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.322
His mission is nothing
short of creating a free

00:01:13.322 --> 00:01:16.319
and world class virtual school
for anyone in the world.

00:01:16.319 --> 00:01:18.985
He will speak about his
experience starting the academy

00:01:18.985 --> 00:01:24.567
and massively transformational
changes in learning and teaching.

00:01:24.567 --> 00:01:28.811
(unintelligible) in the
next five to ten years.

00:01:28.811 --> 00:01:31.223
Sal graduated from MIT in 1998

00:01:31.223 --> 00:01:33.263
with computer science and math degrees

00:01:33.263 --> 00:01:36.789
and received his MBA from
Harvard Business School.

00:01:36.789 --> 00:01:39.892
He left his day job as a
hedge fund analyst in 2009

00:01:39.892 --> 00:01:43.962
to dedicated full time to
his non-profit academy.

00:01:43.962 --> 00:01:48.597
We're delighted and honored to have
this distinguished speaker tonight,

00:01:48.597 --> 00:01:51.537
an emerging giant in the
online education space,

00:01:51.537 --> 00:01:55.514
a world-class educator,
a dynamic communicator,

00:01:55.514 --> 00:02:03.849
and a selfless good-doer,
Salman Khan. (applause)

00:02:03.849 --> 00:02:04.765
Sal: Can you all hear me?

00:02:04.765 --> 00:02:07.931
I'd prefer to just be
closer to you all, than ...

00:02:07.931 --> 00:02:09.680
Can you hear me in the back?

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:11.656
Okay, cool.

00:02:11.656 --> 00:02:14.959
Just like Ed said, I'm Sal,
the founder and faculty

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:17.302
of the Khan Academy. (laughter)

00:02:17.302 --> 00:02:19.764
This is -

00:02:19.764 --> 00:02:23.536
I really want to make this -

00:02:23.536 --> 00:02:25.430
I think this will be a fun conversation.

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:28.915
I don't want this to be me at the
PowerPoint for the whole hour.

00:02:28.915 --> 00:02:32.346
I really want you all to
interrupt me or raise your hand,

00:02:32.346 --> 00:02:34.511
ask me questions, and we can
take this wherever we want to go,

00:02:34.511 --> 00:02:36.680
because there's really a couple of
different conversations we can have

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:39.263
and maybe we can have them all.

00:02:39.263 --> 00:02:43.483
How many of you all have
watched a Khan Academy video?

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:44.990
Okay, that's a pretty good cover.

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:47.462
Just so you know what it is, and actually,

00:02:47.462 --> 00:02:49.159
maybe to get a sense, of the growth.

00:02:49.159 --> 00:02:52.329
Ed said 100,000 and when he
first asked me it was 100,000,

00:02:52.329 --> 00:02:57.301
now it's 200,000 unique students a
month and it's only been two months.

00:02:57.301 --> 00:03:01.335
It is the fastest growing
open course effort.

00:03:01.335 --> 00:03:03.807
Now, it's actually passed up -

00:03:03.807 --> 00:03:05.533
I'm not - Well, I'm a little competitive.

00:03:05.533 --> 00:03:09.918
It passed up MIT recently,
in terms of (laughter)

00:03:09.918 --> 00:03:10.919
being the most used.

00:03:10.919 --> 00:03:13.669
It's getting about 60 or
70,000 video views a day.

00:03:13.669 --> 00:03:18.122
It has closed to 16
million views on YouTube.

00:03:19.768 --> 00:03:22.904
One of the things we can
talk about is maybe why.

00:03:22.904 --> 00:03:26.168
It might be something about the
content, how it's delivered and whatnot.

00:03:26.168 --> 00:03:27.904
We can talk about all of that.

00:03:27.904 --> 00:03:32.822
This is the site, just for those
of you all who have never seen it.

00:03:32.822 --> 00:03:35.544
We can also debate my
user interface skills

00:03:35.544 --> 00:03:43.285
for just putting all 1,400
links (laughter) on one page.

00:03:43.285 --> 00:03:47.221
Those are the videos and if
you click on a random video,

00:03:47.221 --> 00:03:54.510
if you want a review of
(unintelligible) you can click there.

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:57.124
We can let it load up or whatever.

00:03:57.124 --> 00:03:59.261
That's the Khan Academy.

00:03:59.261 --> 00:04:03.227
What I want to do - (unintelligible)

00:04:14.343 --> 00:04:16.208
Is there sound?

00:04:16.208 --> 00:04:19.045
The sound isn't any different than
what you're hearing right now.

00:04:19.045 --> 00:04:24.845
(laughter) You see this and you
hear my voice and you don't see me.

00:04:24.845 --> 00:04:27.287
This'll give you a flavor
for the form factor.

00:04:27.287 --> 00:04:28.787
That could be a conversation we could have

00:04:28.787 --> 00:04:31.322
about why this is an interesting
form factor and why I did it

00:04:31.322 --> 00:04:33.793
and all of that type of thing.

00:04:33.793 --> 00:04:35.656
What I'm going to focus on,
because I think most people

00:04:35.656 --> 00:04:37.737
are familiar with the video library.

00:04:37.737 --> 00:04:40.156
It has this reach, it's gotten popular,

00:04:40.156 --> 00:04:44.406
it's growing 10 or 15%
a month at this point.

00:04:44.406 --> 00:04:46.546
I want to talk about the bigger vision.

00:04:46.546 --> 00:04:50.739
Ed has talked about this idea of
starting a virtual school for the world

00:04:50.739 --> 00:04:53.489
and obviously, videos are a start.

00:04:53.489 --> 00:04:55.521
They're the lecture part of a school,

00:04:55.521 --> 00:04:58.989
but a real school's got to
be more than just video.

00:04:58.989 --> 00:05:01.096
You have to have some
interaction with other people,

00:05:01.096 --> 00:05:03.322
you have to have practice,
you have to have assessment,

00:05:03.322 --> 00:05:05.632
you have to have data
and all of these things.

00:05:05.632 --> 00:05:09.103
That's what I want to talk about
and I'm generally open to ideas,

00:05:09.103 --> 00:05:10.604
because this is a work in progress.

00:05:10.604 --> 00:05:12.278
Some of it is starting to be built.

00:05:12.278 --> 00:05:15.822
Hopefully over the next few months
it'll be built in a much bigger way.

00:05:15.822 --> 00:05:18.073
Some volunteers have come out
of the woodwork very recently

00:05:18.073 --> 00:05:20.656
to supercharge some of these efforts.

00:05:20.656 --> 00:05:23.706
It's exciting times.

00:05:24.573 --> 00:05:28.206
Let me get the presentation up.

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:34.621
A good number of you all saw the videos.

00:05:34.621 --> 00:05:37.787
How many of you all saw the
web application on the site?

00:05:37.787 --> 00:05:41.159
Okay, that's a much
lower penetration rate.

00:05:41.159 --> 00:05:42.895
Just so you all know a
little bit of the history,

00:05:42.895 --> 00:05:45.037
and I'm happy to go into
this as much as you want,

00:05:45.037 --> 00:05:47.703
but I started doing
this remotely tutoring,

00:05:47.703 --> 00:05:50.455
because I was in Boston, my
cousins were in New Orleans,

00:05:50.455 --> 00:05:53.171
and she was having trouble
with units and I said,

00:05:53.171 --> 00:05:57.455
"Hey, after your school and my
work let's get together virtually.

00:05:57.455 --> 00:06:00.944
"We'll use Yahoo Doodle,
it'll be a shared notepad

00:06:00.944 --> 00:06:03.147
"that we can each see what
each other is writing."

00:06:03.147 --> 00:06:06.619
I got her a little Wacom pen
tablet, I had one for myself.

00:06:06.619 --> 00:06:09.430
We'd just do conference calls
and that's how I started.

00:06:09.430 --> 00:06:11.132
Then she started doing really well,

00:06:11.132 --> 00:06:14.846
then I started tutoring her
brothers, other cousins.

00:06:14.846 --> 00:06:17.596
Then a couple of things happened

00:06:17.596 --> 00:06:18.972
and I usually go straight to the videos,

00:06:18.972 --> 00:06:23.375
because that's what it's known for,
but being a computer science geek,

00:06:23.375 --> 00:06:25.477
I didn't even think of
doing the videos at first.

00:06:25.477 --> 00:06:27.512
I said, "Hey, you know what,
I'm going to write soft -

00:06:27.512 --> 00:06:29.680
I would give them these little lectures

00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:32.783
and I would just point them
to random websites, like,

00:06:32.783 --> 00:06:34.954
"Hey, there's a cool applet
on that website over there.

00:06:34.954 --> 00:06:37.433
"Why don't you try it out and tell
me tomorrow whether you understood,

00:06:37.433 --> 00:06:40.673
"whether you're able to
do those exercises, or use
that website over there,"

00:06:40.673 --> 00:06:44.263
I just got really frustrated, this
piecemeal website here, website there,

00:06:44.263 --> 00:06:45.634
so I said, "I'm going to
write a couple of javascript,

00:06:45.634 --> 00:06:47.846
"little things that'll
generate problems for them."

00:06:47.846 --> 00:06:51.536
It's not just ten problems and it
may come up with some random numbers

00:06:51.536 --> 00:06:53.180
and give them as many
problems as they need.

00:06:53.180 --> 00:06:54.955
I made a bunch of these modules.

00:06:54.955 --> 00:06:57.478
I'll show you what the modules look like.

00:06:58.096 --> 00:07:02.215
This is like a multiplying decimals module

00:07:02.215 --> 00:07:05.652
and we can go into as much
depth on these as you want.

00:07:05.652 --> 00:07:08.346
I started making these little
javascript modules for them

00:07:08.346 --> 00:07:11.157
and it was starting really where
she was, at units and basic algebra

00:07:11.157 --> 00:07:12.929
and adding and subtracting
negative numbers,

00:07:12.929 --> 00:07:16.629
and basic linear
equations and then I said,

00:07:16.629 --> 00:07:18.063
"Gee, you know, I don't trust -

00:07:18.063 --> 00:07:19.798
I'd say, "Hey, Nadia,
did you do the problems?

00:07:19.798 --> 00:07:20.732
"How many did you do?"

00:07:20.732 --> 00:07:23.969
and she's like, "Oh yeah, I did
them (unintelligible) (laughter)

00:07:23.969 --> 00:07:27.445
I was like, "I'm going to put
a database behind this thing."

00:07:27.445 --> 00:07:29.778
I put a database behind
it so I could keep track

00:07:29.778 --> 00:07:32.180
of when she did the problem,
how long was it taking her,

00:07:32.180 --> 00:07:33.948
how many times was she doing,

00:07:33.948 --> 00:07:36.420
how frequently was she getting
one right or one wrong.

00:07:36.420 --> 00:07:38.022
Then I started making them up.

00:07:38.022 --> 00:07:41.975
On that first slide right there,
each of these circles is a module,

00:07:41.975 --> 00:07:43.639
and literally, the first module -

00:07:43.639 --> 00:07:45.322
This was a very organic process.

00:07:45.322 --> 00:07:47.596
It was really just me working
with my cousins and iterating,

00:07:47.596 --> 00:07:49.604
saying it would be nice to have the data.

00:07:49.604 --> 00:07:52.937
Then, I started making
modules here one off

00:07:52.937 --> 00:07:55.139
and I would at first
just point them to it.

00:07:55.139 --> 00:07:58.242
Then after a while, I was like,
there's some kind of dependency here,

00:07:58.242 --> 00:08:01.044
because Nadia got that, but
she needs help with that,

00:08:01.044 --> 00:08:04.690
so to fill in that gap,
let me make another module.

00:08:04.690 --> 00:08:08.003
Then, after a while, I got tired
of having to assign the modules,

00:08:08.003 --> 00:08:10.953
so I said, "Well, it should
automatically assign the modules,

00:08:10.953 --> 00:08:13.752
"because once she gets
ten in a row in this,

00:08:13.752 --> 00:08:16.013
"she's ready for this, this, and this."

00:08:16.013 --> 00:08:19.585
So, I created this internal
dependency in the little app

00:08:19.585 --> 00:08:22.799
to do this and I said, "Well,
this is kind of a neat graph."

00:08:22.799 --> 00:08:24.469
This is what I was using just
to keep track of the modules,

00:08:24.469 --> 00:08:26.404
I should just expose this to the students,

00:08:26.404 --> 00:08:28.837
so they know what's going on.

00:08:28.837 --> 00:08:31.920
This is the app and this started
well before I made the first video,

00:08:31.920 --> 00:08:34.143
but it's kind of like the
secret of the Khan Academy,

00:08:34.143 --> 00:08:36.944
so you're getting a little tidbit.

00:08:36.944 --> 00:08:39.717
But I think it's also the
future on a lot of levels.

00:08:39.717 --> 00:08:41.873
So this right here, this is
literally level one addition,

00:08:41.873 --> 00:08:43.761
so it's literally 1+1.

00:08:43.761 --> 00:08:46.264
If you go to the website,
there is literally a video

00:08:46.264 --> 00:08:53.436
on 1+1 and at first, it's almost
a joke that I made the video

00:08:53.436 --> 00:08:57.038
on adding 1+1, but the
whole idea behind it,

00:08:57.038 --> 00:09:01.445
besides being cute, is
to give people the notion

00:09:01.445 --> 00:09:05.081
that no matter how basic your
skills, you can go to this site

00:09:05.081 --> 00:09:09.371
and you will find something
that fits your need

00:09:09.371 --> 00:09:12.791
and the idea that you can, when
you see 1+1 on the same page

00:09:12.791 --> 00:09:15.560
as vector calculus, you're like,

00:09:15.560 --> 00:09:21.332
"Gee, I just have to step through that
thing and I can get to vector calculus.

00:09:21.332 --> 00:09:24.113
"There's not some mysterious - (laughter)

00:09:24.113 --> 00:09:27.337
"And it's the same dude who's going
to take me through the - (laughter)

00:09:27.337 --> 00:09:29.408
"My Kindergarten teacher is
teaching me vector calculus."

00:09:29.408 --> 00:09:34.444
(laughter) You get ten in a row and -

00:09:34.444 --> 00:09:37.541
Once this was made, then
it started to make -

00:09:37.541 --> 00:09:39.704
This became what a lot of
people in education talk about,

00:09:39.704 --> 00:09:42.923
differentiated learning,
with data and all of that,

00:09:42.923 --> 00:09:46.840
but it made me pause and say,
"This is working for my cousins,"

00:09:46.840 --> 00:09:48.547
but there was actually
one piece that was missing

00:09:48.547 --> 00:09:49.923
and that was the -

00:09:49.923 --> 00:09:51.381
I still had to do -

00:09:51.381 --> 00:09:55.220
When I first started it, I thought -

00:09:55.220 --> 00:09:57.340
It randomly generated these problems

00:09:57.340 --> 00:10:00.325
and picked random numbers here
and then when you clicked hint,

00:10:00.325 --> 00:10:02.924
it would show you the exact
steps for that problem.

00:10:02.924 --> 00:10:05.028
I was like, "Oh, that's all you
need to learn how to do a problem.

00:10:05.028 --> 00:10:06.966
"You just need the exact
steps for that exact problem.

00:10:06.966 --> 00:10:08.432
"This'll work for my cousins."

00:10:08.432 --> 00:10:09.366
But it didn't.

00:10:09.366 --> 00:10:12.371
It would help them if they kind of
knew how to multiply decimals already,

00:10:12.371 --> 00:10:14.256
but it didn't get them over that hurdle.

00:10:14.256 --> 00:10:17.309
I still had to do that one-on-one
session with them remotely.

00:10:17.309 --> 00:10:19.547
That became hard to scale.

00:10:19.547 --> 00:10:21.645
Literally, another buddy
from MIT, we were at dinner

00:10:21.645 --> 00:10:24.589
and he's like, "Why don't
you make YouTube videos?

00:10:24.589 --> 00:10:25.816
"The thing that you do with your cousins,

00:10:25.816 --> 00:10:27.721
"why don't you just
record that on YouTube?"

00:10:27.721 --> 00:10:29.673
I was completely dismissive of the idea.

00:10:29.673 --> 00:10:33.089
I was like, "Oh, that's so
silly, I have this software.

00:10:33.089 --> 00:10:36.493
"It generates problems
dynamically, (laughter)

00:10:36.493 --> 00:10:38.427
"it's got hints, what's a
YouTube video going to do?"

00:10:38.427 --> 00:10:40.673
He's like, "Yeah, you're right,
it's probably a stupid idea."

00:10:40.673 --> 00:10:42.066
(laughter) I went home and I was like,

00:10:42.066 --> 00:10:43.367
"Well, maybe there's something to it."

00:10:43.367 --> 00:10:46.258
Literally, when I kept recording
videos with my cousins,

00:10:46.258 --> 00:10:49.007
I would do the tenth lecture on
negative numbers with a new cousin,

00:10:49.007 --> 00:10:52.210
I was like, "Yeah, maybe a
YouTube video will make sense."

00:10:52.210 --> 00:10:56.006
I made the first YouTube video
on greatest common divisor

00:10:56.006 --> 00:10:58.007
and this and that and then -

00:10:58.007 --> 00:11:01.584
I've said this in talks
before, the immediate feedback

00:11:01.584 --> 00:11:03.572
I got from my cousins was that,

00:11:03.572 --> 00:11:08.743
"You are better on YouTube
than you are live." (laughter)

00:11:08.743 --> 00:11:13.017
The point, I think, that he
was trying to communicate is

00:11:13.017 --> 00:11:16.713
it had none of the pressure of
a traditional tutoring session.

00:11:16.713 --> 00:11:20.076
"Did you get this?" and
you're staring at the person.

00:11:20.076 --> 00:11:23.685
They're like, "Yeah,
maybe I did," (laughter)

00:11:23.685 --> 00:11:27.189
and they're giving you bad information,
because they didn't get it.

00:11:27.189 --> 00:11:30.491
They feel bad pausing or repeating me,

00:11:30.491 --> 00:11:33.194
but they can do it all they
want with a YouTube video,

00:11:33.194 --> 00:11:36.992
or they can go to Wikipedia, or they
might be afraid of even admitting

00:11:36.992 --> 00:11:39.993
that they don't know how to
borrow or regroup or whatever,

00:11:39.993 --> 00:11:44.274
but now they can actually review
it in these one off videos.

00:11:44.274 --> 00:11:46.877
Then other people started
watching it, as well, and said,

00:11:46.877 --> 00:11:49.243
"Hey, there's something
there," and on top of that,

00:11:49.243 --> 00:11:51.881
I incorporated with this,
because that was the whole point

00:11:51.881 --> 00:11:55.215
in the first place, to have if you've
never seen this concept before,

00:11:55.215 --> 00:11:57.619
you at least have this
outlet, these YouTube videos

00:11:57.619 --> 00:12:01.122
that you could somehow access, but
before I go into the depths of this,

00:12:01.122 --> 00:12:02.890
I want to -

00:12:02.890 --> 00:12:07.409
Once this was built, then I had
this, "This seems to be working,

00:12:07.409 --> 00:12:12.244
"but let's compare it to what goes
on right now in the school system."

00:12:12.244 --> 00:12:17.262
If you think, the whole conversation
about education right now,

00:12:17.262 --> 00:12:20.596
it's all about the student-teacher ratios,

00:12:20.596 --> 00:12:23.596
how can we make the
inner city, poor schools

00:12:23.596 --> 00:12:27.764
look a lot like the fancy, rich
schools, give people computers,

00:12:27.764 --> 00:12:31.318
but no one is fundamentally
questioning the model.

00:12:31.318 --> 00:12:33.321
If you really think
about the model itself,

00:12:33.321 --> 00:12:36.826
I don't want to taint
your opinion before -

00:12:36.826 --> 00:12:38.994
It's bizarre.

00:12:38.994 --> 00:12:42.897
You have this situation,
you go to the classroom

00:12:42.897 --> 00:12:45.275
and you're all in a room together -

00:12:45.275 --> 00:12:47.525
We'll talk about what you could do
if you're all in a room together,

00:12:47.525 --> 00:12:49.071
but there's no interaction.

00:12:49.071 --> 00:12:51.940
It's just this broadcast
lecture, especially once you get

00:12:51.940 --> 00:12:54.823
to the university level, but even
in the classroom in middle school.

00:12:54.823 --> 00:12:57.146
There might be a little
one question here or there,

00:12:57.146 --> 00:13:00.274
but fundamentally, it's a
broadcast lecture to the room.

00:13:00.274 --> 00:13:04.026
The teacher is pretty much
guaranteed to lose half the students,

00:13:04.026 --> 00:13:06.489
or bore half the students,
and at some point,

00:13:06.489 --> 00:13:07.898
they're going to switch the whole time.

00:13:07.898 --> 00:13:13.186
You do that, then the student has
to go home, do their homework.

00:13:13.186 --> 00:13:14.451
They do it in a complete vacuum.

00:13:14.451 --> 00:13:16.856
They have a textbook, every other problem

00:13:16.856 --> 00:13:18.658
there's a solution in
the back, you don't know

00:13:18.658 --> 00:13:21.600
why you got it right or wrong, anything.

00:13:21.600 --> 00:13:23.269
You don't have anyone to help you.

00:13:23.269 --> 00:13:24.305
If you're lucky you might get a tutor

00:13:24.305 --> 00:13:26.042
or a parent might be able to help you.

00:13:26.042 --> 00:13:27.901
Then you go to the class the next day

00:13:27.901 --> 00:13:30.844
and there might be some
type of review of homework

00:13:30.844 --> 00:13:32.780
or something, but really no real feedback

00:13:32.780 --> 00:13:34.069
and the cycle repeats itself.

00:13:34.069 --> 00:13:35.734
You get another lecture,
then you go back home,

00:13:35.734 --> 00:13:37.051
you do homework in a
vacuum, and this whole time

00:13:37.051 --> 00:13:38.551
you don't know what you're doing at all.

00:13:38.551 --> 00:13:40.402
The teacher has no data, nothing.

00:13:40.402 --> 00:13:42.273
That occurs for a couple of days

00:13:42.273 --> 00:13:44.952
and then, bam, you have an assessment.

00:13:44.952 --> 00:13:53.368
The assessment, some students
get 50%, 80%, 70%, 90%.

00:13:53.368 --> 00:13:56.506
The good students get 95%, next concept.

00:13:56.506 --> 00:14:00.202
Even if you fail an
exam, the class moves on.

00:14:00.202 --> 00:14:02.848
You don't know half of the
subject, half of the material

00:14:02.848 --> 00:14:05.982
in that previous concept and
the class is going to move on.

00:14:05.982 --> 00:14:07.585
You might say that failing student's bad

00:14:07.585 --> 00:14:08.786
and the A students are all right,

00:14:08.786 --> 00:14:11.119
but they still didn't
know 5% of the concept.

00:14:11.119 --> 00:14:14.035
Maybe it was a careless mistake,
but maybe they didn't know

00:14:14.035 --> 00:14:16.227
what happens when you take
something to the zeroth power.

00:14:16.227 --> 00:14:19.565
Maybe they didn't know exactly
what a fractional exponent was,

00:14:19.565 --> 00:14:21.398
that one problem on the exam
with the fractional exponent.

00:14:21.398 --> 00:14:26.702
That A student, the one who's
getting the positive label,

00:14:26.702 --> 00:14:29.030
when they go to calculus
and they see that,

00:14:29.030 --> 00:14:30.568
what are they going to do?

00:14:30.568 --> 00:14:32.543
They're not going to get 95%,
they're going to get 90%,

00:14:32.543 --> 00:14:34.504
because they're going to miss
that and another concept.

00:14:34.504 --> 00:14:38.174
That's not even to mention about the 50%.

00:14:38.174 --> 00:14:39.126
You have this bizarre -

00:14:39.126 --> 00:14:41.376
The first time you get
assessment is when it's time

00:14:41.376 --> 00:14:42.910
to move to the next concept.

00:14:42.910 --> 00:14:44.404
In no way is it actionable.

00:14:44.404 --> 00:14:45.846
If you really think about the process,

00:14:45.846 --> 00:14:48.814
it's just this huge filtering mechanism.

00:14:48.814 --> 00:14:52.020
It's just this process
where every step of the way

00:14:52.020 --> 00:14:53.710
we're just knocking
more and more people off

00:14:53.710 --> 00:14:56.543
and the lucky people in this
room, we were the people

00:14:56.543 --> 00:14:59.958
who happened to be lucky
enough that we were assessed

00:14:59.958 --> 00:15:01.876
and filtered at the right
place at the right time

00:15:01.876 --> 00:15:05.101
and that led to us feeling really
smart and going on. (laughter)

00:15:05.101 --> 00:15:08.005
That's the way it works.

00:15:08.005 --> 00:15:09.102
It makes you really question -

00:15:09.102 --> 00:15:12.067
We're all lucky. (laughter)

00:15:12.067 --> 00:15:14.510
That's the big takeaway.

00:15:14.510 --> 00:15:17.876
What's happening here, what
I think is happening here,

00:15:17.876 --> 00:15:22.017
is that whole cycle, it's
all happening instantaneously

00:15:22.017 --> 00:15:23.876
with every interaction.

00:15:23.876 --> 00:15:26.458
The instruction, if you've never seen

00:15:26.458 --> 00:15:29.494
multiplying decimals before in
your life, you click "watch video",

00:15:29.494 --> 00:15:31.875
it pumps in from YouTube,
and you can imagine

00:15:31.875 --> 00:15:35.128
there's one or two videos right now,
but you eventually have ten videos,

00:15:35.128 --> 00:15:37.043
you're tracking whether the
person watched the video,

00:15:37.043 --> 00:15:39.232
you can eventually track
whether they paused or repeated,

00:15:39.232 --> 00:15:41.068
where they watched, and I'll
talk more about that later on,

00:15:41.068 --> 00:15:42.789
how you can perfect the content.

00:15:42.789 --> 00:15:46.107
They get the instruction there,
then they can do the practice,

00:15:46.107 --> 00:15:48.542
so you're giving them practice
and you get immediate feedback.

00:15:48.542 --> 00:15:49.977
Did I get it right or wrong?

00:15:49.977 --> 00:15:52.620
If you don't know how to do it, you
get the exact steps for that problem

00:15:52.620 --> 00:15:54.585
and then you're also getting assessment,

00:15:54.585 --> 00:15:56.421
because every time you do a problem,

00:15:56.421 --> 00:15:57.918
it's tracking everything about that.

00:15:57.918 --> 00:15:59.538
When you did it, how long it took you,

00:15:59.538 --> 00:16:03.037
how many times did you click "hint",

00:16:03.037 --> 00:16:05.495
and then the paradigm here, and I
literally did this just on a whim,

00:16:05.495 --> 00:16:08.453
I was just like, "How do I know if
someone really knows something?"

00:16:08.453 --> 00:16:12.873
It's not 90%, or it's not 95%, just keep
doing it until you get ten in a row.

00:16:12.873 --> 00:16:14.833
Ten in a row should be the paradigm,

00:16:14.833 --> 00:16:17.538
because then that will enforce
a certain level of discipline.

00:16:17.538 --> 00:16:18.789
People say, "Oh isn't that -

00:16:18.789 --> 00:16:21.610
No, when you take the SAT, you can't make

00:16:21.610 --> 00:16:23.188
those little careless mistakes.

00:16:23.188 --> 00:16:25.779
You should enforce a
certain level of precision.

00:16:25.779 --> 00:16:27.438
I just threw out ten in a row.

00:16:27.438 --> 00:16:29.205
It doesn't have to be ten in a
row, it could be five in a row,

00:16:29.205 --> 00:16:31.454
or whatever, depending on the concept,

00:16:31.454 --> 00:16:34.854
but if you think about what's
happening when you enforce it

00:16:34.854 --> 00:16:37.789
is you don't allow that
95% student to move on

00:16:37.789 --> 00:16:42.453
while not knowing that 5% and then
only get lost in the next topic.

00:16:42.453 --> 00:16:44.899
That's the general idea.

00:16:44.899 --> 00:16:46.403
This right here is the -

00:16:46.403 --> 00:16:48.370
This is just another example of a module.

00:16:48.370 --> 00:16:49.745
This is slope of a line.

00:16:49.745 --> 00:16:52.703
If you don't know how to do, just do
"hint" and it draws things for you.

00:16:52.703 --> 00:16:54.144
It's just another indication of -

00:16:54.144 --> 00:16:55.611
All of this is live.

00:16:55.611 --> 00:16:57.813
You can go right now to
KhanExercises.appspot.com

00:16:57.813 --> 00:17:00.120
and you can try out all of
this stuff and I encourage you

00:17:00.120 --> 00:17:01.517
if you have friends or family members.

00:17:01.517 --> 00:17:03.202
There was even a guy at the
hedge fund I worked with

00:17:03.202 --> 00:17:05.254
who was going to take the GMAT
and he was summa cum laude

00:17:05.254 --> 00:17:09.260
from Yale and he's like,
"What should I use for math?"

00:17:09.260 --> 00:17:10.591
"You should use this."

00:17:10.591 --> 00:17:12.205
He was like, "Hey, but this
is starting me at 1+1."

00:17:12.205 --> 00:17:13.999
I said, "Just do it."

00:17:13.999 --> 00:17:15.794
Two weeks later, he was like,
"That was good." (laughter)

00:17:15.794 --> 00:17:21.538
It's amazing how long many people
haven't multiplied decimals. (laughter)

00:17:21.538 --> 00:17:26.674
That's the self-paced
student view of the world.

00:17:26.674 --> 00:17:29.945
I still haven't given you
the whole virtual school.

00:17:29.945 --> 00:17:32.249
Right now we're talking about videos

00:17:32.249 --> 00:17:34.684
and then we've kind of automated
the self-directed learning

00:17:34.684 --> 00:17:37.873
and learning at your own
pace and getting assessed,

00:17:37.873 --> 00:17:39.988
but then you have to think about
how can you incorporate that

00:17:39.988 --> 00:17:41.704
with the human experience.

00:17:41.704 --> 00:17:45.526
You're coming into a room
together to essentially learn

00:17:45.526 --> 00:17:48.609
how can you use this technology
to hyper charge that?

00:17:48.609 --> 00:17:51.400
Actually, before I even talk about this,

00:17:51.400 --> 00:17:54.637
there's actually a very simple
flipping of the classroom

00:17:54.637 --> 00:17:55.941
that I think should occur tomorrow.

00:17:55.941 --> 00:17:58.691
You don't need any of this software,
because the videos already exist

00:17:58.691 --> 00:18:00.192
and some teachers - It wasn't my idea -

00:18:00.192 --> 00:18:02.859
A teacher in London said that he is now -

00:18:02.859 --> 00:18:04.311
If you think, it's actually a no-brainer.

00:18:04.311 --> 00:18:06.650
I don't understand why this
doesn't happen worldwide tomorrow.

00:18:06.650 --> 00:18:10.776
He is now assigning the
lectures for homework

00:18:10.776 --> 00:18:12.920
and he's having the students
do homework in the classroom.

00:18:12.920 --> 00:18:14.559
There's no other technology necessary.

00:18:14.559 --> 00:18:16.108
Think about what happens there.

00:18:16.108 --> 00:18:21.731
Right now, we all gather at
seven in the morning in 10250

00:18:21.731 --> 00:18:26.167
and we're all with our
peers and (unintelligible)

00:18:26.167 --> 00:18:30.109
We have to sit passively and
just get this broadcast lecture

00:18:30.109 --> 00:18:31.753
and then we go off on our own

00:18:31.753 --> 00:18:34.011
and we do these problem sets in a vacuum.

00:18:34.011 --> 00:18:36.096
If you flip the model and
the lecture, as we said,

00:18:36.096 --> 00:18:38.413
is one size fits all, I
might be lost or bored,

00:18:38.413 --> 00:18:40.443
I might have gaps from the last
lecture that I didn't understand,

00:18:40.443 --> 00:18:42.526
but I still have to
get this exact lecture.

00:18:42.526 --> 00:18:47.338
You flip the model, you get
on-demand video at home,

00:18:47.338 --> 00:18:50.831
when you're ready for
it, when you're awake.

00:18:50.831 --> 00:18:56.055
I got a letter from a student
about they did actually have

00:18:56.055 --> 00:18:58.554
a good calculus teacher, but
he had two rows in front of him

00:18:58.554 --> 00:19:02.471
this really cute girl and every
day he's just trying to figure out

00:19:02.471 --> 00:19:06.916
how he can ask her out and he missed
two months of calculus. (laughter)

00:19:06.916 --> 00:19:08.637
This was his only -

00:19:09.436 --> 00:19:11.020
(laughter)

00:19:16.189 --> 00:19:20.972
I say that's a story of another
person, but - (laughter)

00:19:21.879 --> 00:19:25.079
We all had similar stories. (laughter)

00:19:26.841 --> 00:19:29.530
We go home and we do these
problem sets in a complete vacuum.

00:19:29.530 --> 00:19:31.532
We have no one to help
us, but if you flip it,

00:19:31.532 --> 00:19:33.565
you can watch things at your
own pace, fill in your gaps,

00:19:33.565 --> 00:19:35.990
do whatever you need and then
when you're in the classroom,

00:19:35.990 --> 00:19:40.038
you have 30 or 40 or 400
of your peers to help you

00:19:40.038 --> 00:19:41.657
and you have the professor
who can walk around

00:19:41.657 --> 00:19:43.656
and in real time, see
how people are doing,

00:19:43.656 --> 00:19:46.310
two weeks before the
assessment, two weeks before

00:19:46.310 --> 00:19:48.380
everyone gets that label
placed on their head

00:19:48.380 --> 00:19:51.284
that they're a B student.

00:19:51.284 --> 00:19:54.073
If you really think about it,
honestly, and I'm not this touchy -

00:19:54.073 --> 00:19:57.203
These people who are
anti-grades and that's like,

00:19:57.203 --> 00:19:58.823
oh, that's touchy feely.

00:19:58.823 --> 00:20:01.240
I'm anti-grades because
I think it's ridiculous.

00:20:01.240 --> 00:20:02.823
It's not about -

00:20:02.823 --> 00:20:06.866
It's because if you're a
B student, you shouldn't -

00:20:06.866 --> 00:20:08.933
Everyone should be forced
to be an A student.

00:20:08.933 --> 00:20:10.239
It's on that concept.

00:20:10.239 --> 00:20:12.303
It's silly, you'll meet many, many people,

00:20:12.303 --> 00:20:13.938
and I think this room is an exception,

00:20:13.938 --> 00:20:15.156
but you'll meet many, many people who went

00:20:15.156 --> 00:20:18.811
through algebra, algebra
two, geometry, pre-calculus,

00:20:18.811 --> 00:20:21.906
trigonometry, calculus, and
when they see an algebra problem

00:20:21.906 --> 00:20:25.453
in front of their face, they don't see it.

00:20:25.453 --> 00:20:28.489
They have never had mastery
of anything in between

00:20:28.489 --> 00:20:32.073
and this whole exercise of
going from one hoop to the next

00:20:32.073 --> 00:20:34.240
and being an A- student the whole way,

00:20:34.240 --> 00:20:36.628
it's just an exercise in
filtering, it's not an exercise

00:20:36.628 --> 00:20:39.199
in actually making people
have tangible skills

00:20:39.199 --> 00:20:41.301
that they can do
something productive with.

00:20:41.301 --> 00:20:44.103
What I just described, flipping the model,

00:20:44.103 --> 00:20:45.804
that's if you have no technology,

00:20:45.804 --> 00:20:48.275
but if you have the technology,
what you can do is teach -

00:20:48.275 --> 00:20:51.240
There's a bunch of student
names here that you can't see,

00:20:51.240 --> 00:20:55.047
I've blanked them out, but this is
a report that a teacher could have

00:20:55.047 --> 00:20:57.983
and this is actually a real report,
this isn't a Photoshop version.

00:20:57.983 --> 00:21:00.120
This was at a summer camp where they used

00:21:00.120 --> 00:21:01.657
what I showed you in
the last couple slides

00:21:01.657 --> 00:21:04.724
as their math curriculum,
where every student was able

00:21:04.724 --> 00:21:08.863
to work at their own pace and
the teacher walks in every day.

00:21:08.863 --> 00:21:11.490
Each column here is one of those modules

00:21:11.490 --> 00:21:14.534
that we saw on that first
slide, one of those concepts.

00:21:14.534 --> 00:21:16.534
Each row here is a student.

00:21:16.534 --> 00:21:19.157
Green means the student already
got ten in a row on that concept.

00:21:19.157 --> 00:21:21.372
They did it, they're cool.

00:21:21.372 --> 00:21:24.075
Purple means that they're
working on it right now,

00:21:24.075 --> 00:21:27.573
that that's their frontier
of learning at the moment.

00:21:27.573 --> 00:21:30.074
Everything seems to be going okay.

00:21:30.074 --> 00:21:33.927
Red means that students done 50 problems.

00:21:33.927 --> 00:21:35.548
Sometimes you can think of the heuristic.

00:21:35.548 --> 00:21:37.413
That student's done 50 problems,

00:21:37.413 --> 00:21:39.300
95% of students who have done 50 problems

00:21:39.300 --> 00:21:40.636
in that module usually move on.

00:21:40.636 --> 00:21:41.997
This student has not.

00:21:41.997 --> 00:21:43.872
Some type of intervention should occur,

00:21:43.872 --> 00:21:45.164
some type of human intervention.

00:21:45.164 --> 00:21:47.700
A teacher could look at this and
either they could eyeball it.

00:21:47.700 --> 00:21:49.309
They could say, "Hey,
look, everyone's doing fine

00:21:49.309 --> 00:21:51.780
"but these two kids need
help in level two division.

00:21:51.780 --> 00:21:53.688
"Let everyone else work at their own pace,

00:21:53.688 --> 00:21:55.615
" let me just take
these two students aside

00:21:55.615 --> 00:21:58.086
"and do a very intimate,
focused intervention

00:21:58.086 --> 00:21:59.142
"on just those two students."

00:21:59.142 --> 00:22:01.642
Even better, you can pair
these two students up

00:22:01.642 --> 00:22:03.579
with these two students initially

00:22:03.579 --> 00:22:04.928
and see if that gets them over the hurdle.

00:22:04.928 --> 00:22:08.141
You can actually capture the
data before and after that.

00:22:08.141 --> 00:22:09.964
I'm not there yet, but if the software

00:22:09.964 --> 00:22:11.893
is actually scheduling the interactions,

00:22:11.893 --> 00:22:13.474
you can actually see
what happens before those

00:22:13.474 --> 00:22:16.474
and start to rank teachers and
students and all of that type of thing.

00:22:16.474 --> 00:22:19.474
Slowly work up to the
level of the teacher.

00:22:19.474 --> 00:22:24.445
What I think should happen and
hope that this catalyzes it

00:22:24.445 --> 00:22:27.224
is we go back to a one-room schoolhouse.

00:22:27.224 --> 00:22:30.517
We go back to room full of
people, from Kindergartners

00:22:30.517 --> 00:22:32.559
all the way to anybody.

00:22:32.559 --> 00:22:35.309
Senior citizens who want
to come back and learn

00:22:35.309 --> 00:22:37.974
and they're all working at their own pace

00:22:37.974 --> 00:22:42.308
and if you have trouble with a
concept, even if you don't know,

00:22:42.308 --> 00:22:44.498
this will know if you having
trouble with a concept.

00:22:44.498 --> 00:22:47.667
It will pair you with somebody else
and it'll know about that interaction,

00:22:47.667 --> 00:22:49.891
it'll know how good of an
instructor that person was

00:22:49.891 --> 00:22:52.807
before and after, you'll
rate them, whatever else.

00:22:52.807 --> 00:22:54.724
Then, you can keep escalating
up and up the ladder

00:22:54.724 --> 00:22:56.474
until eventually you can
get by the paid teacher.

00:22:56.474 --> 00:22:58.179
You can actually have a reality where -

00:22:58.179 --> 00:23:00.047
Obviously there's a huge aspect

00:23:00.047 --> 00:23:02.058
of actually teaching people for retention.

00:23:02.058 --> 00:23:04.417
This isn't just a way to
get economics and scale.

00:23:04.417 --> 00:23:06.229
This whole mechanism, I'm a ninth grader

00:23:06.229 --> 00:23:08.623
and I'm teaching a sixth
grader negative numbers.

00:23:08.623 --> 00:23:11.224
That, by itself, is a
hugely powerful tool.

00:23:11.224 --> 00:23:12.974
I'm learning things better
than I ever learned before

00:23:12.974 --> 00:23:14.122
just doing these videos.

00:23:14.122 --> 00:23:15.309
You can imagine if you're -

00:23:15.309 --> 00:23:16.497
And this whole level of maturity.

00:23:16.497 --> 00:23:17.887
I think, actually, if
you hang out with people

00:23:17.887 --> 00:23:19.567
older and younger than yourself,
you actually act more mature

00:23:19.567 --> 00:23:21.876
for a whole set of reasons.

00:23:21.876 --> 00:23:23.938
Then, all of a sudden, you have a
model, where everyone is learning,

00:23:23.938 --> 00:23:26.407
the classroom is actually
an interactive experience,

00:23:26.407 --> 00:23:29.533
it's no longer a passive
experience, everyone is operating

00:23:29.533 --> 00:23:31.246
exactly at the level that they need to,

00:23:31.246 --> 00:23:33.712
and it actually scales.

00:23:33.712 --> 00:23:35.200
You can actually make it economic.

00:23:35.200 --> 00:23:36.317
You could actually have -

00:23:36.317 --> 00:23:38.753
Everyone's obsessed with
student-teacher ratios,

00:23:38.753 --> 00:23:40.783
but student-teacher ratios assume a model

00:23:40.783 --> 00:23:43.658
that if there's one of me and ten of you,

00:23:43.658 --> 00:23:44.950
then we can have a conversation.

00:23:44.950 --> 00:23:46.060
If there's one of me and 20 of you,

00:23:46.060 --> 00:23:47.395
we're going to have
less of a conversation.

00:23:47.395 --> 00:23:48.562
If there's one of me and 100 of you,

00:23:48.562 --> 00:23:49.616
we're not going to have a conversation.

00:23:49.616 --> 00:23:51.365
That's true, to some degree, but here,

00:23:51.365 --> 00:23:52.949
everyone works at their own pace.

00:23:52.949 --> 00:23:55.069
Even if there's 100
students and one paid tutor,

00:23:55.069 --> 00:23:58.339
because you have this
interaction, I'm willing to bet

00:23:58.339 --> 00:23:59.741
that you're going to
have a better interaction

00:23:59.741 --> 00:24:02.443
with that one paid teacher who
can now be paid 100 grand a year,

00:24:02.443 --> 00:24:04.533
instead of what teachers get paid.

00:24:04.533 --> 00:24:06.533
You're going to have a better
interaction in this world

00:24:06.533 --> 00:24:08.535
with a 100:1 student-teacher
ratio, than you'd probably get

00:24:08.535 --> 00:24:14.320
in even the fanciest private
schools that there are right now.

00:24:15.165 --> 00:24:19.836
This right here, this is
literally the summer program

00:24:19.836 --> 00:24:21.311
had asked about this and
I was curious myself.

00:24:21.311 --> 00:24:23.245
This was literally me just
doing sequel queries in the data

00:24:23.245 --> 00:24:27.082
every night from the summer camp.

00:24:27.082 --> 00:24:30.653
It's not like a rigorous study,
but to me, it speaks to the power

00:24:30.653 --> 00:24:32.531
of every student working at their own pace

00:24:32.531 --> 00:24:36.364
and throws into question, the
traditional notions of assessment,

00:24:36.364 --> 00:24:40.164
which we, I think, sense are
(unintelligible) to begin with.

00:24:40.164 --> 00:24:43.531
What this chart is doing,
this axis right here

00:24:43.531 --> 00:24:45.281
is the days in the summer camp.

00:24:45.281 --> 00:24:47.571
It was a six-week program
and this is just a count

00:24:47.571 --> 00:24:49.515
of the modules completed.

00:24:49.515 --> 00:24:52.614
This black line right here, that's
the class mean, the class average.

00:24:52.614 --> 00:24:57.364
On day seven in this class
of 30 or so students,

00:24:57.364 --> 00:25:00.365
the average student has
completed 23 modules.

00:25:00.365 --> 00:25:01.852
That's what that tells us.

00:25:01.852 --> 00:25:04.365
You can actually even see
that they all started at 1+1.

00:25:04.365 --> 00:25:05.826
It was actually an interesting idea,

00:25:05.826 --> 00:25:07.322
because we started
another group not at 1+1

00:25:07.322 --> 00:25:10.260
and some subset of the
students always got stuck.

00:25:10.260 --> 00:25:12.330
They just never moved on, even
though we started them at fifth grade

00:25:12.330 --> 00:25:14.948
and they were seventh graders,
some subset always got stuck.

00:25:14.948 --> 00:25:18.115
We saw when we started everyone
at 1+1, no one got stuck,

00:25:18.115 --> 00:25:20.865
which tells you that there
are some smart people

00:25:20.865 --> 00:25:25.281
who have some gaps and it
never gets addressed otherwise.

00:25:25.281 --> 00:25:27.364
You can have the best
algebra teacher on the planet

00:25:27.364 --> 00:25:29.614
and you can have an innately
very intelligent kid,

00:25:29.614 --> 00:25:33.198
but if he or she just is a little
foggy on multiplying decimals,

00:25:33.198 --> 00:25:36.220
there's no hope, they're just
going to talk past each other

00:25:36.220 --> 00:25:38.031
and it's just going to be a
very frustrating experience.

00:25:38.031 --> 00:25:40.531
When we started everyone at
1+1, and you see it here.

00:25:40.531 --> 00:25:42.995
It's a very steep curve,
this is the review.

00:25:42.995 --> 00:25:45.095
This was the kids just getting ten
in row, ten in row, ten in a row.

00:25:45.095 --> 00:25:46.660
Then it starts to level out a bit.

00:25:46.660 --> 00:25:49.099
This is, you can see
the learning happening.

00:25:49.099 --> 00:25:51.031
The interesting thing, at least to me,

00:25:51.031 --> 00:25:53.236
the interesting thing about
this is the green lines

00:25:53.236 --> 00:25:55.030
are standard deviation
above and below that mean.

00:25:55.030 --> 00:25:58.985
You can plot all the students here,
but this student in particular,

00:25:58.985 --> 00:26:02.879
on day five, if you did a
pre-assessment for the class,

00:26:02.879 --> 00:26:07.722
if you did an assessment right
here, he only completed 12 modules.

00:26:07.722 --> 00:26:09.604
More than one standard
deviation below the mean.

00:26:09.604 --> 00:26:11.852
If you were in the traditional,
if you were tracking students,

00:26:11.852 --> 00:26:13.625
you'd say, "Oh, she's a remedial student,

00:26:13.625 --> 00:26:14.769
"she's going to hold the class back,

00:26:14.769 --> 00:26:16.438
"or we have to hold the rest
of the class back for her.

00:26:16.438 --> 00:26:18.128
"She doesn't belong in here," all that

00:26:18.128 --> 00:26:20.101
and you would put a big
label on her forehead.

00:26:20.101 --> 00:26:24.152
"You're never going to be an
engineer," and all of these things

00:26:24.152 --> 00:26:26.219
and actually it does happen
around sixth or seventh grade.

00:26:26.219 --> 00:26:30.942
That is when these labels, these
careers get ruled out for students.

00:26:30.942 --> 00:26:32.559
Because she was able to spend a little -

00:26:32.559 --> 00:26:34.993
I was curious, I was like,
"What happened to her?"

00:26:34.993 --> 00:26:37.822
and I could go into the data and I
could see exactly what she was doing.

00:26:37.822 --> 00:26:39.329
She was spending more
time than everyone else

00:26:39.329 --> 00:26:41.133
on adding and subtracting
negative numbers.

00:26:41.133 --> 00:26:43.942
Just to understand this
chart right here, each bar,

00:26:43.942 --> 00:26:45.172
this is the first problem she did.

00:26:45.172 --> 00:26:49.441
Red is wrong, blue is right, and
the height is how long it took her.

00:26:49.441 --> 00:26:51.810
This is just from the
data of the interaction.

00:26:51.810 --> 00:26:54.079
You can see she got a
couple of questions wrong,

00:26:54.079 --> 00:26:55.813
then she maybe guessed one right,

00:26:55.813 --> 00:26:57.983
then you have this big long time
she actually watched the video here.

00:26:57.983 --> 00:26:59.191
I looked at the video log.

00:26:59.191 --> 00:27:01.656
She watched the video here, then
she got a couple more right,

00:27:01.656 --> 00:27:03.422
but then she still got a few wrong.

00:27:03.422 --> 00:27:05.441
Once again, in a traditional classroom,

00:27:05.441 --> 00:27:10.329
she would have been said, "Oh, at
this point you are an A student.

00:27:10.329 --> 00:27:13.231
"You got nine of ten right,
or you got 19/20 right

00:27:13.231 --> 00:27:15.899
"and you're an A student,"
and force her to keep going.

00:27:15.899 --> 00:27:18.979
A couple more right, one wrong,
then finally she got ten in a row.

00:27:18.979 --> 00:27:21.205
You can actually see that
she also got faster on it.

00:27:21.205 --> 00:27:22.773
There's a whole other element of speed,

00:27:22.773 --> 00:27:24.976
which does matter on
some standardized tests.

00:27:24.976 --> 00:27:27.246
Once she got through
that, once she was able

00:27:27.246 --> 00:27:28.522
to just remediate herself

00:27:28.522 --> 00:27:31.942
and really build a strong
foundation, she just raced ahead.

00:27:31.942 --> 00:27:33.023
This was just in six weeks.

00:27:33.023 --> 00:27:35.086
She went from being the second
to worst student in the class,

00:27:35.086 --> 00:27:38.056
if you want to measure that way,
to the second to third best.

00:27:38.056 --> 00:27:39.608
All the students are on the chart here.

00:27:39.608 --> 00:27:40.733
In just six weeks.

00:27:40.733 --> 00:27:42.774
It makes you question, if
you did an assessment here,

00:27:42.774 --> 00:27:45.191
and I show that because
she literally raced

00:27:45.191 --> 00:27:50.234
through level three linear
equations, which is like 2x+7=-3x-4

00:27:50.234 --> 00:27:53.173
and she just thought it was intuitive
after doing maybe level two.

00:27:53.173 --> 00:27:54.192
She just raced.

00:27:54.192 --> 00:27:55.809
If you saw that student,
you'd say, "Oh, she's gifted."

00:27:55.809 --> 00:28:00.692
(laughter) It makes you really question.

00:28:00.692 --> 00:28:04.275
We were just the lucky kids that
got assessed at the right time

00:28:04.275 --> 00:28:07.749
and got all positive feedback and
we were assessed at that point,

00:28:07.749 --> 00:28:10.555
but there's probably a lot of
people who might've been able

00:28:10.555 --> 00:28:13.559
to eat our lunch eventually,
who got kicked off.

00:28:17.158 --> 00:28:19.998
This, I show this, this
is data from YouTube.

00:28:19.998 --> 00:28:23.608
I think everything I talked about before

00:28:23.608 --> 00:28:26.003
is how do you make sure
a student learns properly

00:28:26.003 --> 00:28:28.192
and how do you make sure that
their foundation is built

00:28:28.192 --> 00:28:29.976
and how do you use that data to optimize

00:28:29.976 --> 00:28:32.847
the actual physical
interactions, but I show this

00:28:32.847 --> 00:28:36.263
to show that there's another dimension
of perfecting the actual content.

00:28:36.263 --> 00:28:37.598
This is data that YouTube gives me.

00:28:37.598 --> 00:28:39.889
They call this audience attention.

00:28:39.889 --> 00:28:42.014
What they do is they
measure the drop off rate

00:28:42.014 --> 00:28:44.097
off of a YouTube video relative

00:28:44.097 --> 00:28:45.933
to the average YouTube
video of that length.

00:28:45.933 --> 00:28:47.792
Let's say the average
YouTube video at minute three

00:28:47.792 --> 00:28:49.848
has lost 40% of its audience.

00:28:49.848 --> 00:28:52.262
That's just a natural drop off rate.

00:28:52.262 --> 00:28:55.734
At minute three, if I've
lost 40% of my audience,

00:28:55.734 --> 00:28:57.513
I'll be hugging the line right there.

00:28:57.513 --> 00:29:00.430
If I've only lost 20% of my
audience, I'll be above average.

00:29:00.430 --> 00:29:02.431
That's what they're measuring
there, but you can imagine -

00:29:02.431 --> 00:29:07.346
Actually, I've seen a few of my
videos where this curve does this.

00:29:07.346 --> 00:29:08.930
It just drops off.

00:29:08.930 --> 00:29:11.383
I can go at that exact
minute in the video and see,

00:29:11.383 --> 00:29:14.720
Oh, I said orthogonality and
I never defined orthogonality.

00:29:14.720 --> 00:29:18.122
I can either re-record the video,
I could put a little bubble there,

00:29:18.122 --> 00:29:20.098
where you can get more information.

00:29:20.098 --> 00:29:25.030
You're getting real data that
allows you to actually iterate

00:29:25.030 --> 00:29:26.713
and perfect on what you're producing

00:29:26.713 --> 00:29:28.414
and you can imagine two
dimensions, this is attention.

00:29:28.414 --> 00:29:32.329
You could also have efficacy, if you
couple it with the actual exercise

00:29:32.329 --> 00:29:36.143
and you keep iterating on it
until you have a gem of a video

00:29:36.143 --> 00:29:37.579
and you can even have
multiple people's videos

00:29:37.579 --> 00:29:39.114
and see what's better
for different people.

00:29:39.114 --> 00:29:40.829
This all exists in Netflix.

00:29:40.829 --> 00:29:44.843
There's no reason why it
shouldn't exist in education.

00:29:47.986 --> 00:29:49.526
This right here is the big picture.

00:29:49.526 --> 00:29:52.255
I'm talking about a virtual
school for the world.

00:29:52.255 --> 00:29:57.293
This is what I think it's going
to be and I'm open to any ideas

00:29:57.293 --> 00:30:01.128
or any nuance parts of it, but
you have your video library.

00:30:01.128 --> 00:30:03.673
That's the low-hanging fruit, it's
the first line of instruction,

00:30:03.673 --> 00:30:05.211
you can pause it and repeat it.

00:30:05.211 --> 00:30:08.677
One thing, I spoke to a journal
of higher education recently

00:30:08.677 --> 00:30:12.176
and sometimes I'm very diplomatic,
I don't rock too many boats,

00:30:12.176 --> 00:30:16.211
but I was in a quirky mood and I hadn't
eaten for a long time. (laughter)

00:30:16.211 --> 00:30:17.948
People who know my eating
habits, I often don't eat

00:30:17.948 --> 00:30:20.543
for long periods of time,
but I just went off.

00:30:20.543 --> 00:30:22.753
I was like, "I challenge you,"
because this is a journal

00:30:22.753 --> 00:30:24.588
read by professors and educators.

00:30:24.588 --> 00:30:28.878
I was like, "Why does a 300 person
lecture even exist anymore?"

00:30:28.878 --> 00:30:32.212
In what way, just tell me
one way that that is better

00:30:32.212 --> 00:30:33.878
than on-demand video.

00:30:33.878 --> 00:30:36.267
I'm happy for any of you all to -

00:30:36.267 --> 00:30:40.105
It's this broadcast
lecture to a room of people

00:30:40.105 --> 00:30:42.006
in a certain amount of time
that's 90 minutes long,

00:30:42.006 --> 00:30:44.961
people have gaps, and the
professor sees blank faces.

00:30:44.961 --> 00:30:46.461
It's just this all around -

00:30:46.461 --> 00:30:47.847
I think the only reason it exists

00:30:47.847 --> 00:30:50.017
is because people associate it
with the college experience.

00:30:50.017 --> 00:30:53.684
People expect when I pay 30
or $40,000, I should get this.

00:30:53.684 --> 00:30:55.988
That's the only, in my
mind, why it exists.

00:30:55.988 --> 00:30:58.211
With on-demand video you
can pause, repeat it.

00:30:58.211 --> 00:31:03.095
The producer can get data on
what's working, what's not.

00:31:03.095 --> 00:31:05.543
You can get your best professors
to produce the best content

00:31:05.543 --> 00:31:07.378
and keep iterating it,
making it better and better.

00:31:07.378 --> 00:31:08.570
People can fill in their gaps.

00:31:08.570 --> 00:31:10.401
That's what the video library's all about.

00:31:10.401 --> 00:31:12.404
Then you have the web applications.

00:31:12.404 --> 00:31:14.368
You saw one of them, but
there's actually another one.

00:31:14.368 --> 00:31:15.951
There's some gentlemen
in the back of the room

00:31:15.951 --> 00:31:19.035
who started working on it.

00:31:19.035 --> 00:31:20.618
There's a whole suite of web
applications you can build

00:31:20.618 --> 00:31:22.285
for allowing people to
learn at their own pace.

00:31:22.285 --> 00:31:24.368
What you saw was for math.

00:31:24.368 --> 00:31:25.607
We're working on something.

00:31:25.607 --> 00:31:28.522
I'd be happy to talk about
it if you're all curious

00:31:28.522 --> 00:31:32.357
for more fact-based knowledge.

00:31:32.357 --> 00:31:35.107
Learning american history or
geography, things like that.

00:31:35.107 --> 00:31:37.329
You can even have web
applications for peer assessment,

00:31:37.329 --> 00:31:39.097
for creative writing, all sorts of things.

00:31:39.097 --> 00:31:40.606
When you actually compose things
for other people to review,

00:31:40.606 --> 00:31:42.801
it becomes a whole other
level, whole other game

00:31:42.801 --> 00:31:44.570
than when you're writing
something for a teacher to mark up

00:31:44.570 --> 00:31:47.805
and say you're a B+
and then throw it away.

00:31:47.805 --> 00:31:50.189
There's a whole suite of web
applications you can build

00:31:50.189 --> 00:31:51.976
and then on top of that
you use all of that data

00:31:51.976 --> 00:31:54.147
to actually facilitate
peer-to-peer interactions.

00:31:54.147 --> 00:31:56.149
I hinted that in the classroom,
but there's no reason why

00:31:56.149 --> 00:31:58.187
it just has to be
limited to the classroom.

00:31:58.187 --> 00:31:59.819
If I'm having trouble
with quantum mechanics

00:31:59.819 --> 00:32:01.988
and the best instructor for
quantum mechanics is in Mexico City

00:32:01.988 --> 00:32:05.322
and we're both free at
4:00 PM eastern time,

00:32:05.322 --> 00:32:07.522
no reason that we can't
set up an interaction

00:32:07.522 --> 00:32:09.939
with a pen tablet, the way I used
to do it with my cousin Nadia

00:32:09.939 --> 00:32:12.964
and have an interaction, even
better record that interaction,

00:32:12.964 --> 00:32:14.691
so that other people in
the future can use it.

00:32:14.691 --> 00:32:16.439
I rate them based on how they were,

00:32:16.439 --> 00:32:18.010
they can even rate me on
how I was as a student

00:32:18.010 --> 00:32:20.241
and the system knows what I did
before and after that interaction.

00:32:20.241 --> 00:32:23.410
It actually knows whether it
was a statistically significant

00:32:23.410 --> 00:32:25.492
intervention in some way.

00:32:25.492 --> 00:32:27.879
This is the big picture and you
can just keep getting the data

00:32:27.879 --> 00:32:30.772
and iterating and iterating and iterating
it to make it a better solution.

00:32:30.772 --> 00:32:35.653
That's the master plan. (laughter)

00:32:35.653 --> 00:32:37.357
Any questions?

00:32:37.357 --> 00:32:38.439
Yeah.

00:32:38.439 --> 00:32:40.424
Audience Member: I know
you've got this initial focus

00:32:40.424 --> 00:32:43.107
of K through 12 and math and whatnot.

00:32:43.107 --> 00:32:44.829
Audience Member: Sorry, we
can't hear the question.

00:32:44.829 --> 00:32:46.522
Audience Member: Okay,
one of the things you said

00:32:46.522 --> 00:32:49.105
really struck me as an
educator, which is your comment

00:32:49.105 --> 00:32:52.105
about everyone should be
forced to be an A student.

00:32:52.105 --> 00:32:55.522
If you think about this is
a (unintelligible) exercise

00:32:55.522 --> 00:32:59.343
with a lot of unwilling institutions
trying to get them to change.

00:32:59.343 --> 00:33:03.106
It seems to me that this
idea, just this one idea

00:33:03.106 --> 00:33:06.718
would be very powerful to take
into professional certification,

00:33:06.718 --> 00:33:10.689
say nursing degrees, where
you're not going to be a nurse

00:33:10.689 --> 00:33:14.060
until you achieve this level
of competency on the exam.

00:33:14.060 --> 00:33:17.464
Take a profession, where this idea

00:33:17.464 --> 00:33:19.164
that everybody does
have to be an A student

00:33:19.164 --> 00:33:24.303
in order to have a career and
get them to buy into this model

00:33:24.303 --> 00:33:26.803
and maybe get the resources
from that sort of problem

00:33:26.803 --> 00:33:31.022
or that sort of field
to test these ideas out

00:33:31.022 --> 00:33:34.814
and to show how they work or they
find implementation or whatever.

00:33:34.814 --> 00:33:38.105
Sal: I think it exists in
professional development,

00:33:38.105 --> 00:33:39.483
because people say,
"Look, if you're a nurse

00:33:39.483 --> 00:33:41.154
"and you don't know this,
people are going to die,"

00:33:41.154 --> 00:33:45.707
so they do enforce that
with doctors, nurses, and -

00:33:45.707 --> 00:33:47.684
That exists, but it isn't -

00:33:47.684 --> 00:33:53.314
We could do studies, but I
think it's almost intuitive

00:33:53.314 --> 00:33:54.858
that if you go back to -

00:33:54.858 --> 00:33:58.145
Someone that has real mastery of algebra

00:33:58.145 --> 00:34:00.931
is going to be way more
powerful than someone

00:34:00.931 --> 00:34:03.478
who has B- student level of understanding

00:34:03.478 --> 00:34:05.570
of algebra through differential equations.

00:34:05.570 --> 00:34:07.184
They're never going to be
able to apply any of it,

00:34:07.184 --> 00:34:08.124
as opposed to -

00:34:08.124 --> 00:34:10.641
I've worked at - When I was
working at a hedge fund,

00:34:10.641 --> 00:34:14.040
there was once a CFO who said -

00:34:14.040 --> 00:34:16.125
I was like, "What's your
incremental gross margin?"

00:34:16.125 --> 00:34:16.781
He's like, "Oh, we don't divulge that."

00:34:16.781 --> 00:34:19.063
I was like, "You just gave it to me.

00:34:19.063 --> 00:34:21.562
"You told me your gross
profit in two periods

00:34:21.562 --> 00:34:23.893
"and how many units you sold
in two periods (laughter)

00:34:23.893 --> 00:34:24.977
"That's your -

00:34:24.977 --> 00:34:27.589
Everyone in the room was like, "Oh my God,

00:34:27.589 --> 00:34:29.893
"this is some kind of
rocket science," (laughter)

00:34:29.893 --> 00:34:34.562
That is algebra one, that is
algebra one, and no one in the room.

00:34:34.562 --> 00:34:38.144
There are MBAs, there were PhDs
in the room, very smart people,

00:34:38.144 --> 00:34:40.893
but no one could recognize
and that is a failure

00:34:40.893 --> 00:34:43.205
and these are the successful
people in our education system.

00:34:43.205 --> 00:34:45.040
People need to -

00:34:45.040 --> 00:34:49.412
If we had real mastery of algebra,
the world would be a different place.

00:34:49.412 --> 00:34:50.992
All the calculus and
all of that other stuff

00:34:50.992 --> 00:34:54.453
would just be for fun, but it's not -

00:34:54.453 --> 00:34:57.501
I don't even think it has to be tested.

00:34:57.501 --> 00:34:59.861
If people really understood algebra,

00:34:59.861 --> 00:35:01.170
that's going to be way better

00:35:01.170 --> 00:35:03.027
than people halfway understanding algebra

00:35:03.027 --> 00:35:06.029
and then moving on to other things.

00:35:06.029 --> 00:35:07.310
Yeah?

00:35:07.310 --> 00:35:08.943
Audience Member: A question about
the peer-to-peer interaction.

00:35:08.943 --> 00:35:11.579
Do you see that happening now, actually?

00:35:11.579 --> 00:35:14.718
If you have 16 million views on
YouTube, I imagine there's comments.

00:35:14.718 --> 00:35:18.420
Is there comment moderation happening?

00:35:18.420 --> 00:35:20.019
Sal: You all can go home and look.

00:35:20.019 --> 00:35:23.858
Some of the debates or
even some of the commentary

00:35:23.858 --> 00:35:25.251
on the YouTube videos
are like what teachers

00:35:25.251 --> 00:35:27.195
would dream of having in their classroom.

00:35:27.195 --> 00:35:28.894
Someone says, "Hey,
this was a great video,

00:35:28.894 --> 00:35:32.146
"but I don't quite get what
Sal did at minute 2:34,"

00:35:32.146 --> 00:35:33.561
and there's a little link in
YouTube you can go right back

00:35:33.561 --> 00:35:35.396
to that little point in the video.

00:35:35.396 --> 00:35:37.561
Then other people will
comment on it and say,

00:35:37.561 --> 00:35:39.228
"Oh, you just have to
watch that other video

00:35:39.228 --> 00:35:42.175
"and he explains that in depth," or,
"Here's another page you can watch,"

00:35:42.175 --> 00:35:44.479
or they'll actually just
explain it right there.

00:35:44.479 --> 00:35:46.063
This is just on a simple message board.

00:35:46.063 --> 00:35:50.121
It definitely already exists
and it's literally just -

00:35:50.121 --> 00:35:54.170
I get at least five emails a day
asking for a better community

00:35:54.170 --> 00:35:57.296
to tap into this and I've just
been waiting to do it right.

00:35:57.296 --> 00:36:01.081
It's there and people
love to help each other

00:36:01.081 --> 00:36:04.292
and they just don't have a
good way of doing it right now.

00:36:04.914 --> 00:36:07.267
Audience Member: I have children in
the first grade and fourth grade.

00:36:07.267 --> 00:36:10.468
What would you suggest I
do with them with this?

00:36:10.468 --> 00:36:11.566
Sal: First through fourth?

00:36:11.566 --> 00:36:14.409
Audience Member: First and fourth.

00:36:14.409 --> 00:36:15.575
Sal: This is not scientific.

00:36:15.575 --> 00:36:18.438
I've tried out the app
with different aged kids.

00:36:18.438 --> 00:36:23.556
The 1+1, it is 1+1 but it doesn't
have dancing bears. (laughter)

00:36:23.556 --> 00:36:25.253
I hope to eventually have dancing -

00:36:25.253 --> 00:36:29.603
Everyone likes dancing
(laughter) A Kindergartner.

00:36:29.603 --> 00:36:31.224
I found Kindergarten -

00:36:31.224 --> 00:36:34.430
I've seen some precocious second
or third graders get into it.

00:36:34.430 --> 00:36:36.061
They don't need the
dancing bears and the music

00:36:36.061 --> 00:36:37.856
and all of that type of thing.

00:36:37.856 --> 00:36:42.381
Your fourth grader, I think,
could be ready for this.

00:36:42.381 --> 00:36:45.572
The videos I've seen very
young kids like them.

00:36:45.572 --> 00:36:46.840
They like the -

00:36:46.840 --> 00:36:47.604
I don't know what they like about it.

00:36:47.604 --> 00:36:50.939
They like the black
background and the colors.

00:36:50.939 --> 00:36:52.815
They respond to the videos.

00:36:52.815 --> 00:36:55.354
I've seen three or four year
olds, it holds their attention.

00:36:55.354 --> 00:36:57.869
I don't know if they're
retaining anything. (laughter)

00:36:57.869 --> 00:37:01.767
You might want to start with the
videos for your younger student,

00:37:01.767 --> 00:37:04.644
but the fourth grader, I
think, is ready for the app.

00:37:04.644 --> 00:37:06.766
Audience Member: The younger kid
goes straight to the YouTube.

00:37:06.766 --> 00:37:10.562
Sal: Yeah, I think so, and you
might want to watch it with them.

00:37:10.562 --> 00:37:12.184
Some people have told me that
they watch a couple of videos

00:37:12.184 --> 00:37:17.268
at night with their kid and it's in
place of a bedtime story. (laughter)

00:37:17.268 --> 00:37:19.171
Why not?

00:37:19.770 --> 00:37:22.037
Audience Member: Are your
videos in your system

00:37:22.073 --> 00:37:24.988
a little too big for one laptop per child?

00:37:24.988 --> 00:37:26.045
Audience Member: What's the question?

00:37:26.045 --> 00:37:27.322
Sal: The question is your
video and your system

00:37:27.322 --> 00:37:30.566
a little too big for one laptop per child?

00:37:30.566 --> 00:37:31.682
I guess there's a couple of -

00:37:31.682 --> 00:37:34.182
In terms of ...

00:37:34.182 --> 00:37:35.905
Audience Member: Getting
any of that content to them,

00:37:35.905 --> 00:37:38.622
because right now I think they're
just doing textbook format, right?

00:37:38.622 --> 00:37:40.691
Sal: Yeah, so the
question is, is it too big

00:37:40.691 --> 00:37:44.740
for getting the content
into one laptop per child?

00:37:44.740 --> 00:37:46.071
The easy answer is no.

00:37:46.071 --> 00:37:48.863
When I first saw one laptop per child,

00:37:48.863 --> 00:37:50.905
this is before Khan Academy
was really well thought out,

00:37:50.905 --> 00:37:53.100
I was like, "What are they going to
do on that one laptop per child?"

00:37:53.100 --> 00:37:55.941
There's examples of people
using it for lights and things

00:37:55.941 --> 00:38:01.153
as opposed to for a computer.

00:38:01.153 --> 00:38:05.615
I think it could be used
tomorrow on one laptop per child.

00:38:05.615 --> 00:38:07.490
Audience Member: But do
they have enough drive space

00:38:07.490 --> 00:38:08.613
and things like that?

00:38:08.613 --> 00:38:13.362
A lot of them don't have
network connectivity.

00:38:13.362 --> 00:38:16.432
Sal: The raw videos, they're
going to be on iTunes U soon,

00:38:16.432 --> 00:38:18.267
so I just talked to the Apple
people and I handed them the disk

00:38:18.267 --> 00:38:22.716
that had all the raw
videos and it was 40 gigs.

00:38:22.716 --> 00:38:26.967
I think if you took the
Flash versions, it's 14 gigs.

00:38:26.967 --> 00:38:28.633
I don't know how big the
hard drives are, though,

00:38:28.633 --> 00:38:31.780
but soon they're going to be
able to store all of the -

00:38:31.780 --> 00:38:33.749
Audience Member: It's actually
something you should look into,

00:38:33.749 --> 00:38:35.084
because that's a big deal, right?

00:38:35.084 --> 00:38:35.967
Sal: I would love to.

00:38:35.967 --> 00:38:41.004
If they called me up, I'd
say, "Yeah." (laughter)

00:38:41.004 --> 00:38:42.506
I'd love to, I'd love to.

00:38:42.506 --> 00:38:47.067
We can have another talk about -

00:38:47.067 --> 00:38:51.338
I'm talking to a couple of foundations.

00:38:51.338 --> 00:38:53.999
One laptop per child would be
awesome if there's the resources,

00:38:53.999 --> 00:38:56.326
but you don't necessarily
need one laptop per child.

00:38:56.326 --> 00:39:00.084
Get some $200 refurbished
PC, put it in the village.

00:39:00.084 --> 00:39:01.835
Now, all of a sudden, you can
have asynchronous learning,

00:39:01.835 --> 00:39:03.302
which is what these village kids need,

00:39:03.302 --> 00:39:05.138
because they have to
take off for the harvest,

00:39:05.138 --> 00:39:06.409
they have a whole spectrum.

00:39:06.409 --> 00:39:07.475
Some of them can't read, some of them have

00:39:07.475 --> 00:39:10.667
pretty reasonable proficiency.

00:39:10.667 --> 00:39:16.283
That $200 refurbished PC,
instead of being one per student,

00:39:16.283 --> 00:39:19.149
you have 20 students
per day working on it,

00:39:19.149 --> 00:39:21.584
each half an hour a day,
doing this type of thing,

00:39:21.584 --> 00:39:23.792
and then as a foundation, for
the first time in the history

00:39:23.792 --> 00:39:25.237
of philanthropic giving,
you actually have real data

00:39:25.237 --> 00:39:28.327
on what's happening in real
time on the actual utilization

00:39:28.327 --> 00:39:31.084
on your assets, where students
are, how they're performing

00:39:31.084 --> 00:39:34.500
and in terms of the actual
cost, it's a $200 PC

00:39:34.500 --> 00:39:36.834
that'll last four years,
so it's $50 a year

00:39:36.834 --> 00:39:38.036
and you're educating 20 students.

00:39:38.036 --> 00:39:40.750
That's $2.50 per student
per year for an education,

00:39:40.750 --> 00:39:42.667
which is competitive with
anywhere in the third world.

00:39:42.667 --> 00:39:43.916
It's cheaper than pencil and paper.

00:39:43.916 --> 00:39:47.079
I think that's what should be the model,

00:39:47.079 --> 00:39:50.218
but if they get a laptop
that's even better.

00:39:50.218 --> 00:39:51.501
Oh, in the back, yeah.

00:39:51.501 --> 00:39:52.452
Audience Member: I think you said you do

00:39:52.452 --> 00:39:55.003
all the video and lectures yourself.

00:39:55.003 --> 00:39:59.014
How long does it take you
to put together a module?

00:39:59.014 --> 00:40:07.641
There's some topic areas surely you
don't know all of it. (laughter)

00:40:07.641 --> 00:40:11.099
Sal: A video, if it's a work -

00:40:11.099 --> 00:40:13.598
There's probably people emailing
me right now some algebra.

00:40:13.598 --> 00:40:16.431
I think I may really be doing
some kid's homework for them.

00:40:16.431 --> 00:40:19.150
Those type of things where
it's just an algebra problem,

00:40:19.150 --> 00:40:22.655
someone emails it to me, I haven't
done that exact problem before,

00:40:22.655 --> 00:40:26.493
let me just do it, that's
the ten minutes on the video,

00:40:26.493 --> 00:40:29.062
plus five minutes to upload,
it's a very small amount of time.

00:40:29.062 --> 00:40:31.932
If you saw that first screen, I've
started doing world history videos.

00:40:31.932 --> 00:40:34.833
Those take a lot of -

00:40:34.833 --> 00:40:37.898
Audience Member: What
do you mean by a lot?

00:40:37.898 --> 00:40:40.155
Sal: When I started on
the French Revolution,

00:40:40.155 --> 00:40:44.003
I spent a week doing nothing but
reading on the French Revolution.

00:40:44.003 --> 00:40:47.435
I literally just took time off and I
steeped myself in the French Revolution.

00:40:47.435 --> 00:40:49.203
I think we've all found this
when we were going to school

00:40:49.203 --> 00:40:50.984
is that when you're in
the midst of a class,

00:40:50.984 --> 00:40:54.150
you really are an expert for
that short period of time

00:40:54.150 --> 00:41:01.617
until the exam you are an expert,
but then it all goes away. (laughter)

00:41:01.617 --> 00:41:02.650
For that short period
of time, you can talk

00:41:02.650 --> 00:41:03.733
to any academic anywhere in the world

00:41:03.733 --> 00:41:06.688
and you know all of the details
and the nuances and everything.

00:41:06.688 --> 00:41:09.928
About a week of studying
and it's fun studying.

00:41:09.928 --> 00:41:13.150
It's not for an exam, it's for me
and I get to make YouTube videos.

00:41:13.150 --> 00:41:16.432
I'll do that and then I'll
start making the videos

00:41:16.432 --> 00:41:19.434
and then I can probably produce
two or three videos a day.

00:41:19.434 --> 00:41:22.136
Once I have the big picture and
I understand the major pieces

00:41:22.136 --> 00:41:23.869
and I have a sense of -

00:41:23.869 --> 00:41:27.008
If you watch those videos, I
cut and paste a bunch of images

00:41:27.008 --> 00:41:30.510
and maps from Wikipedia
and I just explain them.

00:41:30.510 --> 00:41:33.547
I'm a big map person, so I do that.

00:41:33.547 --> 00:41:34.900
In the back?

00:41:34.900 --> 00:41:36.785
Audience Member: Is the software
that you use to do things

00:41:36.785 --> 00:41:39.317
like draw perfectly straight
lines or doing a ratio

00:41:39.317 --> 00:41:41.982
something you can buy off
the shelf (unintelligible)

00:41:41.982 --> 00:41:43.149
or did you design that all yourself?

00:41:43.149 --> 00:41:45.571
Sal: No, some people have
offered to pay for it,

00:41:45.571 --> 00:41:47.794
but I didn't build any software.

00:41:47.794 --> 00:41:54.102
Actually, all I use is I started
off using Microsoft Paint.

00:41:54.102 --> 00:41:57.315
I made the background
black and I used this thing

00:41:57.315 --> 00:42:00.148
called Screen Video Recorder,
too, which is this shareware,

00:42:00.148 --> 00:42:03.776
freeware, or $20 screen capture software.

00:42:03.776 --> 00:42:07.312
That's what I started the first
500 videos were done like that.

00:42:07.312 --> 00:42:09.394
Then someone just sent
me a Camtasia license.

00:42:09.394 --> 00:42:12.576
They're like, "This is great,
we need to (unintelligible).

00:42:12.576 --> 00:42:15.126
"You need a better screen capture."

00:42:15.126 --> 00:42:17.727
So I started using Camtasia and
then I used Smooth Draw, too,

00:42:17.727 --> 00:42:21.632
which is pressure sensitive,
so it actually looks like
I'm writing with a pen,

00:42:21.632 --> 00:42:25.103
as opposed to Microsoft Paint,
but you could get set up

00:42:25.103 --> 00:42:27.991
for $200 at home with exactly what I have.

00:42:27.991 --> 00:42:30.074
It's all found stuff.

00:42:30.074 --> 00:42:31.242
There's probably better stuff out there.

00:42:31.242 --> 00:42:33.326
What I'm using right now, I
can't draw a straight line.

00:42:33.326 --> 00:42:37.556
With Microsoft Paint I could,
because it had the line tool.

00:42:37.556 --> 00:42:40.190
Audience Member: In line with your
idea of this as entertainment,

00:42:40.190 --> 00:42:45.089
so replacing bedtime stories, I
think there's a niche for retirees.

00:42:45.089 --> 00:42:47.941
I know any number of people
who, first thing in the morning,

00:42:47.941 --> 00:42:50.191
do three crosswords and a sudoku.

00:42:50.191 --> 00:42:50.947
Sal: Exactly.

00:42:50.947 --> 00:42:54.966
Audience Member: (unintelligible)

00:42:54.966 --> 00:43:00.740
Sal: (unintelligible)

00:43:00.740 --> 00:43:06.715
My mother in law
(unintelligible) (laughter)

00:43:06.715 --> 00:43:11.047
I have gotten letters from retirees saying

00:43:11.047 --> 00:43:14.012
that they started doing
it instead of sudoku

00:43:14.012 --> 00:43:18.432
and other than keeping them sharp,

00:43:18.432 --> 00:43:19.990
they're not connecting
with their grandkids.

00:43:19.990 --> 00:43:21.467
They're becoming the grandkids' tutor

00:43:21.467 --> 00:43:22.656
and this is a whole level of connection

00:43:22.656 --> 00:43:24.870
that they couldn't have
before, so there is something.

00:43:24.870 --> 00:43:29.969
Not the retirees, there's a
lot of homeschooling parents -

00:43:29.969 --> 00:43:31.719
I think there's a lot of
homeschoolers who are doing great

00:43:31.719 --> 00:43:34.678
until about algebra and then
they're like, "What do I do next?"

00:43:34.678 --> 00:43:37.110
This is helping them out.

00:43:37.110 --> 00:43:39.552
There's a lot of people who surprise me.

00:43:39.552 --> 00:43:41.410
There's a lot of military
people who are actually my age

00:43:41.410 --> 00:43:43.645
who are going back to college.

00:43:43.645 --> 00:43:45.647
If you think about it,
if you're in your mid-30s

00:43:45.647 --> 00:43:48.230
and you want to go back to college,

00:43:48.230 --> 00:43:49.842
and the first thing you're going
to see when you go to college

00:43:49.842 --> 00:43:51.770
is college algebra and (unintelligible)

00:43:51.770 --> 00:43:55.269
There is nothing out there for you.

00:43:55.269 --> 00:43:57.353
You're helpless and this is
the only thing that's out there

00:43:57.353 --> 00:44:00.103
and they're eternally thankful
that they could re-learn

00:44:00.103 --> 00:44:02.201
arithmetic and algebra
and all these things

00:44:02.201 --> 00:44:03.434
that they haven't seen for 20 years.

00:44:03.434 --> 00:44:05.317
It's surprising.

00:44:05.317 --> 00:44:07.102
Audience Member: I have an eighth grader

00:44:07.102 --> 00:44:13.067
and my question is, would you
say that the videos sometimes

00:44:13.067 --> 00:44:19.307
could replace going back to the
textbook when they get stuck, or -

00:44:19.307 --> 00:44:21.524
Sal: Yeah, so the question and this -

00:44:21.524 --> 00:44:23.092
Audience Member: Because the textbooks -

00:44:23.092 --> 00:44:26.139
Sal: Oh, don't get me started
about textbooks. (laughter)

00:44:26.139 --> 00:44:27.640
No, I will get started about textbooks.

00:44:27.640 --> 00:44:30.334
The question was, "I
have an eighth grader.

00:44:30.334 --> 00:44:33.870
"Do you think the videos
can replace the textbook?"

00:44:33.870 --> 00:44:36.057
Let's think about what a textbook is.

00:44:36.057 --> 00:44:37.224
There's two things in a textbook.

00:44:37.224 --> 00:44:41.890
There's something that claims
to be some form of explanation,

00:44:41.890 --> 00:44:45.884
two pages of text on something,
and then it's exercises.

00:44:45.884 --> 00:44:50.017
There's 50 problems (unintelligible).

00:44:50.017 --> 00:44:52.300
I guarantee you on-demand
video, whether it's Khan Academy

00:44:52.300 --> 00:44:55.524
or anybody, is going to
be better than that prose

00:44:55.524 --> 00:44:59.217
or whatever you want to call it,
that's trying to explain the concept

00:44:59.217 --> 00:45:01.799
and it's usually explained
more for peer-review,

00:45:01.799 --> 00:45:03.497
more for the other
textbook authors saying,

00:45:03.497 --> 00:45:05.933
"Oh yes, he did it
rigorously, that's excellent,"

00:45:05.933 --> 00:45:09.201
as opposed for the
eighth grader who wants -

00:45:09.201 --> 00:45:10.336
Audience Member: (unintelligible)

00:45:10.336 --> 00:45:14.340
Sal: Exactly, I think there's
a small subset of people

00:45:14.340 --> 00:45:16.843
who could actually read a textbook
and that's what a lot of us

00:45:16.843 --> 00:45:18.967
would probably get where
we got, because we could

00:45:18.967 --> 00:45:21.014
actually consume that
information, but most people -

00:45:21.014 --> 00:45:23.349
On-demand video is better than that

00:45:23.349 --> 00:45:25.586
and from an exercise point of view,

00:45:25.586 --> 00:45:28.550
the textbook company doesn't know
who's doing what exercise when,

00:45:28.550 --> 00:45:30.489
who's watching what, what's
actually being effective.

00:45:30.489 --> 00:45:31.485
They're not getting real-time data.

00:45:31.485 --> 00:45:32.325
That stuff I showed -

00:45:32.325 --> 00:45:34.717
You can argue what the
modules should look like,

00:45:34.717 --> 00:45:37.052
but something like that is
going to be infinitely better,

00:45:37.052 --> 00:45:39.166
especially if you can tweak it
and get data on what's working,

00:45:39.166 --> 00:45:40.217
what are people using.

00:45:40.217 --> 00:45:41.549
For all we know, textbook publishers,

00:45:41.549 --> 00:45:44.669
half of those problems are
never touched by anybody.

00:45:44.669 --> 00:45:46.037
They're in there and
kids are getting hernias

00:45:46.037 --> 00:45:48.800
carrying those problems
around and it's a -

00:45:48.800 --> 00:45:54.119
The answer's yes, I think that textbooks
need to go, on a lot of levels.

00:45:54.119 --> 00:45:56.056
Audience Member: So for world history,

00:45:56.056 --> 00:45:58.593
what kind of problems do you put out there

00:45:58.593 --> 00:46:00.528
so you can make your assessment?

00:46:00.528 --> 00:46:01.764
Sal: The question is for world history

00:46:01.764 --> 00:46:04.704
what kind of problems
can you put out there?

00:46:04.704 --> 00:46:07.204
What I showed you, those modules,
that's good for something

00:46:07.204 --> 00:46:09.704
that can be templatized, that you can map.

00:46:09.704 --> 00:46:13.620
You can even do some physics problems
like that, the core problems.

00:46:13.620 --> 00:46:15.876
You could do some types of
chemistry, maybe genetics,

00:46:15.876 --> 00:46:18.873
but what about the
causes of the Civil War.

00:46:18.873 --> 00:46:22.764
Audience Member: Not just that,
but analysis of complex issues.

00:46:22.764 --> 00:46:25.621
Sal: Yeah, there's two levels
of things like history.

00:46:25.621 --> 00:46:28.571
One is the, "What did
Millard Fillmore do?"

00:46:28.571 --> 00:46:31.456
There's that level and
then there's the level of,

00:46:31.456 --> 00:46:35.706
"Let's talk about the impacts
of slavery today," or something.

00:46:35.706 --> 00:46:37.858
The core stuff, and
that's what I'm working on

00:46:37.858 --> 00:46:40.039
with those two gentlemen
in the back there.

00:46:40.039 --> 00:46:43.873
Literally I met them,
(unintelligible) we met last week,

00:46:43.873 --> 00:46:46.456
but what we're working on is a -

00:46:46.456 --> 00:46:49.158
We're working on -

00:46:49.158 --> 00:46:51.425
If we were studying for
a factual based thing,

00:46:51.425 --> 00:46:53.028
we would get together in a big study group

00:46:53.028 --> 00:46:55.764
and write flash cards for each
other and then quiz each other

00:46:55.764 --> 00:46:57.932
on each other's questions.

00:46:57.932 --> 00:47:02.836
What we're working on is a world -

00:47:02.836 --> 00:47:05.240
For American History, put
the whole curriculum there

00:47:05.240 --> 00:47:07.204
and then if you say, "I'm
going to write a question

00:47:07.204 --> 00:47:08.454
"on the Antebellum Period."

00:47:08.454 --> 00:47:10.124
Click Antebellum, you write a question,

00:47:10.124 --> 00:47:12.481
you can embed a video,
image, whatever you want.

00:47:12.481 --> 00:47:14.121
Once you feel good about it,
you put the correct choice,

00:47:14.121 --> 00:47:15.816
incorrect choices, explanation.

00:47:15.816 --> 00:47:17.954
Once you feel good about
it, you publish it.

00:47:17.954 --> 00:47:20.256
If I'm the first person
to see your question,

00:47:20.256 --> 00:47:22.122
I'll say, "Hey, warning, this
is an untouched question,"

00:47:22.122 --> 00:47:24.206
and all of that stuff,
but you should try it out.

00:47:24.206 --> 00:47:28.539
I do the question, I rate it on
quality, difficulty, and importance

00:47:28.539 --> 00:47:30.999
and then you start building
this library of questions

00:47:30.999 --> 00:47:33.039
with metadata around
it and you can imagine

00:47:33.039 --> 00:47:35.045
that you're collecting data,
people who knew this question

00:47:35.045 --> 00:47:37.289
didn't know that question,
so you can quantitatively say

00:47:37.289 --> 00:47:38.872
what's easy or what's harder.

00:47:38.872 --> 00:47:40.787
There's all sorts of ways
you can consume the question.

00:47:40.787 --> 00:47:43.412
You could imagine a teacher, because
you're getting all of this data.

00:47:43.412 --> 00:47:45.247
You know exactly how long it takes
for a certain type of student

00:47:45.247 --> 00:47:47.539
to complete a question, whether
they get it right or wrong.

00:47:47.539 --> 00:47:50.184
You can imagine a history teacher,
once you get this huge data,

00:47:50.184 --> 00:47:53.039
this huge library questions,
like you know what,

00:47:53.039 --> 00:47:56.190
I want to administer an exam to
my history students tomorrow,

00:47:56.190 --> 00:47:57.661
I'm going to bring them
to the computer lab.

00:47:57.661 --> 00:48:02.954
I want 50 questions and I don't
want more than a 95% chance

00:48:02.954 --> 00:48:05.767
that more than two people
aren't going to finish that exam

00:48:05.767 --> 00:48:07.287
and we'll have all of the
data, because it'll know

00:48:07.287 --> 00:48:09.771
for that level of student
how long it'll take them,

00:48:09.771 --> 00:48:16.661
it'll do the statistical model
and then, bam, (unintelligible).

00:48:16.661 --> 00:48:19.742
That's for the core and you
can do that for anything.

00:48:19.742 --> 00:48:23.450
(unintelligible)

00:48:23.450 --> 00:48:25.639
The more nuanced stuff,
that's an open question.

00:48:25.639 --> 00:48:27.139
I'm open to ideas.

00:48:27.139 --> 00:48:32.364
I think there's things,
a peer review of essays,

00:48:32.364 --> 00:48:37.889
or you could argue through
essays and have people vote

00:48:37.889 --> 00:48:39.034
on who's argument is better.

00:48:39.034 --> 00:48:40.101
There's all sorts of things you can do.

00:48:40.101 --> 00:48:42.722
That hasn't been -

00:48:42.722 --> 00:48:45.646
Foreign language, I was
thinking, I have a 15 month old.

00:48:45.646 --> 00:48:48.413
Skype exists, the best foreign language,

00:48:48.413 --> 00:48:51.116
I'm going to have him chat
for a half an hour a week

00:48:51.116 --> 00:48:58.508
with somebody in Mexico
City, Dubai, Hong Kong.

00:48:58.508 --> 00:49:00.158
Half an hour a week and he'll just chat.

00:49:00.158 --> 00:49:02.091
That's foreign language.

00:49:02.091 --> 00:49:03.758
I think there's some very simple things

00:49:03.758 --> 00:49:08.494
with found technology right now that
that could solve some of these problems.

00:49:08.494 --> 00:49:12.548
The immersion, as opposed
to (unintelligible).

00:49:12.548 --> 00:49:13.416
Oh, yeah?

00:49:13.416 --> 00:49:15.575
Audience Member: Very
curious to hear your thoughts

00:49:15.575 --> 00:49:17.954
about the Texas Board of Education and -

00:49:17.954 --> 00:49:19.354
Sal: What about education?

00:49:19.354 --> 00:49:21.124
Audience Member: Have you heard
about the Texas Board of Education?

00:49:21.124 --> 00:49:22.412
Sal: Oh, the Texas Board
of Education (crosstalk)

00:49:22.412 --> 00:49:23.660
Audience Members: They're
trying to rewrite the textbooks,

00:49:23.660 --> 00:49:24.560
especially around American history.

00:49:24.560 --> 00:49:27.325
I'm wondering if that made
you rethink about your mission

00:49:27.325 --> 00:49:28.530
with Khan Academy or -

00:49:28.530 --> 00:49:29.910
Sal: Oh yeah, that's interesting.

00:49:29.910 --> 00:49:32.467
He's asking about the
Texas Board of Education,

00:49:32.467 --> 00:49:34.370
the rewriting of American
History and all that.

00:49:34.370 --> 00:49:37.307
From a personal level, that's
the power of this thing.

00:49:37.307 --> 00:49:38.325
I could all of a sudden -

00:49:38.325 --> 00:49:40.740
I do every now and then
go on Google blog search

00:49:40.740 --> 00:49:42.825
and I see who's using
these Khan Academy videos.

00:49:42.825 --> 00:49:44.644
Obviously, it's a lot of
homeschoolers and all that,

00:49:44.644 --> 00:49:52.017
but actually, a White Supremacy group
loves the Khan Academy. (laughter)

00:49:52.017 --> 00:49:53.482
Because they're like, "This
is quality instruction,

00:49:53.482 --> 00:49:54.714
"our kids aren't getting
it, this is the only way

00:49:54.714 --> 00:49:55.981
"that they're going to be able
to compete with the Asians

00:49:55.981 --> 00:50:03.089
"and the Jews and the - (laughter)

00:50:03.089 --> 00:50:04.733
They could've gotten me to teach them,

00:50:04.733 --> 00:50:08.257
or they would've let me get into
their house and teach their kid,

00:50:08.257 --> 00:50:09.924
but because they recognize
that this is better

00:50:09.924 --> 00:50:11.536
than what they're getting in the school,

00:50:11.536 --> 00:50:13.491
I'm able to get into those
kids' heads, (laughter)

00:50:13.491 --> 00:50:19.158
which would never
(unintelligible) (laughter)

00:50:19.158 --> 00:50:21.896
I think that whole Texas thing,
I think it's a non-issue.

00:50:21.896 --> 00:50:24.562
I think with the internet
and all that, they can debate

00:50:24.562 --> 00:50:26.145
night and day over what
should be in the textbook,

00:50:26.145 --> 00:50:28.026
no one's going to care
at the end of the day,

00:50:28.026 --> 00:50:30.395
because they're going to get
information from other sources.

00:50:30.395 --> 00:50:32.612
The reality is most of
the kids aren't learning

00:50:32.612 --> 00:50:37.104
what they're trying to put in the
textbooks, so who cares? (laughter)

00:50:37.104 --> 00:50:39.573
Audience Member: Are you able to -

00:50:39.573 --> 00:50:41.571
Different people learn in different ways.

00:50:41.571 --> 00:50:43.777
For example, some people
might learn with examples

00:50:43.777 --> 00:50:48.737
and other people want to
learn more deductively.

00:50:48.737 --> 00:50:52.519
Can you identify the
ways that people learn

00:50:52.519 --> 00:50:58.524
and then adjust the instruction
to match the special need?

00:50:58.524 --> 00:51:00.322
Sal: Yeah, the question was can
you adjust to deductive learners

00:51:00.322 --> 00:51:02.882
versus people who need examples?

00:51:02.882 --> 00:51:03.483
We could.

00:51:03.483 --> 00:51:05.918
I don't do it yet, I don't claim
that it's already done and all that,

00:51:05.918 --> 00:51:09.967
but it definitely could be done
and that's another value of this.

00:51:09.967 --> 00:51:12.233
Some people say, "Oh, are you
teaching it this new way or regrouping

00:51:12.233 --> 00:51:13.667
"or are you teaching the
old way with borrowing

00:51:13.667 --> 00:51:15.070
"or are you teaching the
abstract manipulative way

00:51:15.070 --> 00:51:16.672
"or are you teaching ...

00:51:16.672 --> 00:51:19.239
Let's do both, let's do both,
and people can pick and choose

00:51:19.239 --> 00:51:20.543
what they want or do both.

00:51:20.543 --> 00:51:23.795
In a traditional classroom, you
have to make these decisions

00:51:23.795 --> 00:51:25.183
because you have a scarce amount of time,

00:51:25.183 --> 00:51:28.377
scarce amount of resources, you have
to teach it this way or that way,

00:51:28.377 --> 00:51:30.293
but here you can teach them both ways.

00:51:30.293 --> 00:51:32.686
Teach it the deductive way
and then do a lot of examples,

00:51:32.686 --> 00:51:33.738
because that's the way
most people enjoy it.

00:51:33.738 --> 00:51:37.183
There's nothing to stop you from doing it.

00:51:37.183 --> 00:51:39.359
Audience Member: I saw the graph earlier,

00:51:39.359 --> 00:51:41.458
where you show how you
get from (unintelligible)

00:51:41.458 --> 00:51:44.930
all the way through and that's
how the (unintelligible) works

00:51:44.930 --> 00:51:49.230
to build a foundation and you
can extend that even further

00:51:49.230 --> 00:51:52.981
by anything that's factual,
history or geography,

00:51:52.981 --> 00:51:57.343
by taking the graph (unintelligible).

00:51:57.343 --> 00:52:00.947
You can imagine, after you just
learned about the French Revolution,

00:52:00.947 --> 00:52:04.229
and a lesson about French geography,

00:52:04.229 --> 00:52:06.919
you could then be
offered to take a look at

00:52:06.919 --> 00:52:10.022
(unintelligible) for example
and since you've learned

00:52:10.022 --> 00:52:15.486
about (unintelligible) you can
learn about (unintelligible)

00:52:15.486 --> 00:52:20.540
can get you to (unintelligible)
you can always relate it

00:52:20.540 --> 00:52:27.940
to something you already know.

00:52:27.940 --> 00:52:29.706
Sal: Especially once you
have a question library

00:52:29.706 --> 00:52:31.843
and you think about the
best way to navigate it.

00:52:31.843 --> 00:52:32.843
Right now it's just a curriculum.

00:52:32.843 --> 00:52:34.779
You can say, "I want to learn
about the French Revolution,"

00:52:34.779 --> 00:52:38.323
but (unintelligible) organically,
what you're suggesting.

00:52:38.323 --> 00:52:40.695
I haven't built it, but
it can be built today,

00:52:40.695 --> 00:52:42.279
and it's kind of silly
that it's not being built,

00:52:42.279 --> 00:52:46.862
especially considering how
leverage-able something like that is.

00:52:46.862 --> 00:52:49.901
Audience Member: Have you
thought about teaching parents,

00:52:49.901 --> 00:52:53.939
educators, teachers on how to teach,

00:52:53.939 --> 00:52:56.445
how to communicate
effectively to your audience,

00:52:56.445 --> 00:53:01.529
how to troubleshoot where
the hangups, the gaps are.

00:53:01.529 --> 00:53:03.582
Sal: The questions is have I
ever thought about teaching

00:53:03.582 --> 00:53:04.985
to educators or parents how to -

00:53:04.985 --> 00:53:06.695
There's an interesting story there, too.

00:53:06.695 --> 00:53:08.019
This was when Khan Academy was like,

00:53:08.019 --> 00:53:11.890
I was happy if anyone
called me (unintelligible)

00:53:11.890 --> 00:53:14.695
Three years ago, Miami
Dade contacted me and said,

00:53:14.695 --> 00:53:17.614
"Can we use your videos
for teacher training?"

00:53:17.614 --> 00:53:20.166
I was like, "Yeah, sure, that's awesome."

00:53:20.166 --> 00:53:22.434
You all are real educators and
you all want to use my videos.

00:53:22.434 --> 00:53:34.133
I was like, "but why don't you let the
students use them, too." (laughter)

00:53:34.133 --> 00:53:40.070
There is a reality now where ...

00:53:40.070 --> 00:53:43.874
I think there would be
value in telling teachers,

00:53:43.874 --> 00:53:45.945
"Look, you don't have to
be perfect, just be human,

00:53:45.945 --> 00:53:47.713
"and just be conversational,
and don't talk down,

00:53:47.713 --> 00:53:51.833
"and don't try to use this
as a power exertion type

00:53:51.833 --> 00:53:55.333
"of classroom management
type of thing, use it -

00:53:55.333 --> 00:53:57.387
I don't blame teachers,
because the system forces them

00:53:57.387 --> 00:53:59.793
to manage a classroom, demand respect,

00:53:59.793 --> 00:54:05.211
if they have a gap in their
knowledge, you can't be honest.

00:54:05.211 --> 00:54:07.714
If you do that in a classroom then
they're going to undermine you.

00:54:07.714 --> 00:54:09.615
There's all these other
dynamics that occur

00:54:09.615 --> 00:54:13.578
why a teacher can't be human.

00:54:15.503 --> 00:54:18.814
We're in a world where we'll
probably get a subset of teachers

00:54:18.814 --> 00:54:22.519
who are scaling up and then the
rest of the teachers leverage this

00:54:22.519 --> 00:54:25.312
to become the human one-on-one mentor

00:54:25.312 --> 00:54:27.923
and I think that'll be the value.

00:54:27.923 --> 00:54:29.726
It'll just be kind of example if they say,

00:54:29.726 --> 00:54:32.562
"Hey, let's watch this together,"
and then, "Did you get it?

00:54:32.562 --> 00:54:35.229
"If you don't then I'll be your
mentor to walk you through it."

00:54:35.229 --> 00:54:38.034
I'd be happy to if anyone
was interested in me doing

00:54:38.034 --> 00:54:43.206
(unintelligible) anything
like that, but yeah.

00:54:43.206 --> 00:54:46.146
Audience Member: I'm curious about
the peer-to-peer interactions

00:54:46.146 --> 00:54:49.682
and community and how you've got
and where you could be going.

00:54:49.682 --> 00:54:53.644
You've touched on a couple of things
I think are just world-changing.

00:54:53.644 --> 00:54:57.621
Intergenerational,
knowledge transfer, wisdom,

00:54:57.621 --> 00:55:00.063
you talked about one room schoolrooms,

00:55:00.063 --> 00:55:03.693
but what about just
the usual parent-child.

00:55:03.693 --> 00:55:07.532
There's so much that could
happen using this model.

00:55:07.532 --> 00:55:08.644
Where are you?

00:55:08.644 --> 00:55:09.729
Sal: Yeah, so the peer-to-peer,

00:55:09.729 --> 00:55:12.269
that's at the most on the
drawing board right now.

00:55:12.269 --> 00:55:16.607
I haven't ... I've tried it out
with my cousins as a one off basis.

00:55:16.607 --> 00:55:20.565
I feel like it'll definitely work
and the data is being set off,

00:55:20.565 --> 00:55:26.813
but knock on whatever this
is made out of. (laughter)

00:55:26.813 --> 00:55:28.417
Hopefully in the next few weeks

00:55:28.417 --> 00:55:32.397
we'll get some resources to start doing -

00:55:32.397 --> 00:55:35.894
That's the most technically intensive
and we want to get to the point

00:55:35.894 --> 00:55:37.146
where not only are we doing peer-to-peer

00:55:37.146 --> 00:55:38.813
and it's seamless and it's capturing data,

00:55:38.813 --> 00:55:41.064
but it's also recording
those interactions.

00:55:41.064 --> 00:55:42.979
You need some -

00:55:42.979 --> 00:55:45.635
Once you record, then
it's (unintelligible).

00:55:45.635 --> 00:55:47.557
I agree with the whole teacher, with the -

00:55:47.557 --> 00:55:49.056
I want a world where you can -

00:55:49.056 --> 00:55:51.173
If your parents want
to take you to Europe,

00:55:51.173 --> 00:55:52.724
it's not going to
compete with your school.

00:55:52.724 --> 00:55:53.724
You go on that trip to Europe

00:55:53.724 --> 00:55:55.879
and maybe there's another
one room schoolhouse

00:55:55.879 --> 00:55:57.583
part of the same network
that you can go to

00:55:57.583 --> 00:55:59.749
and meet the kids in
Paris while you're there.

00:55:59.749 --> 00:56:00.722
On the plane you can do -

00:56:00.722 --> 00:56:05.054
(unintelligible) I agree
with you completely.

00:56:05.054 --> 00:56:07.056
The peer-to-peer is the hardest to do

00:56:07.056 --> 00:56:09.475
and it's going to be the
one that maybe happens,

00:56:09.475 --> 00:56:11.429
but I think it'll happen
in the next five years.

00:56:11.429 --> 00:56:15.899
I think the potential is large.

00:56:16.199 --> 00:56:17.474
Audience Member: What's
the optimal length or range

00:56:17.474 --> 00:56:20.004
for the different modules
and how many times

00:56:20.004 --> 00:56:24.115
do you have to retape it to satisfy
yourself that it's good enough?

00:56:24.115 --> 00:56:25.777
Sal: The question is,
what's the optimal length

00:56:25.777 --> 00:56:27.777
for I'm assuming the videos especially

00:56:27.777 --> 00:56:29.946
and how many times do I have to retape it?

00:56:29.946 --> 00:56:33.950
When I started off, YouTube
limits you to 10 minutes.

00:56:33.950 --> 00:56:36.722
Now they let me do longer videos,
I'm a partner and all of that,

00:56:36.722 --> 00:56:37.766
but when you start off it's 10 minutes,

00:56:37.766 --> 00:56:43.220
so my first video was 11 minutes and
they didn't let me upload it. (laughter)

00:56:43.220 --> 00:56:45.887
I paid attention to the
clock and I made my videos

00:56:45.887 --> 00:56:49.470
around nine or ten minutes.

00:56:49.470 --> 00:56:51.269
That's the single
biggest point of feedback

00:56:51.269 --> 00:56:54.974
that that is the ideal amount of
time to get one concept across

00:56:54.974 --> 00:56:56.055
while being able to pay attention.

00:56:56.055 --> 00:56:57.610
I've gotten letters from people.

00:56:57.610 --> 00:56:59.137
I've talked to some people
at Google who have done

00:56:59.137 --> 00:57:01.054
some user interface
stuff and how long people

00:57:01.054 --> 00:57:04.103
can pay attention and they said,
"Yeah, it's about ten minutes."

00:57:04.103 --> 00:57:06.586
I think that might even
be what motivated YouTube

00:57:06.586 --> 00:57:11.470
to figure out the limit, but
that forced me to do that.

00:57:11.470 --> 00:57:14.804
One, that's a granular chunk that
allows people to pay attention.

00:57:14.804 --> 00:57:18.135
It turns it into one of these
DaVinci Code Dan Brown type novels

00:57:18.135 --> 00:57:20.767
where each chapter's three
pages and you're like,

00:57:20.767 --> 00:57:24.168
"Okay, I'm done," and you
get a sense of completion,

00:57:24.168 --> 00:57:25.385
as opposed to a 90 minute lecture

00:57:25.385 --> 00:57:27.372
that you can only watch
40 minutes and you feel -

00:57:27.372 --> 00:57:28.940
This also makes it very granular.

00:57:28.940 --> 00:57:31.345
You can really just jump in
and get exactly what you need

00:57:31.345 --> 00:57:33.110
as opposed to sitting
through a 90 minute lecture

00:57:33.110 --> 00:57:35.052
and trying to find -

00:57:35.052 --> 00:57:38.626
I've found that ten minutes
is now I'm getting to -

00:57:38.626 --> 00:57:41.562
Actually, I've done a few videos
now that are pushing 20 minutes,

00:57:41.562 --> 00:57:43.150
but that's just my fault.

00:57:43.150 --> 00:57:45.650
I really think everything
can be done in ten minutes.

00:57:45.650 --> 00:57:47.934
Your other thing is how
many times do I do it?

00:57:47.934 --> 00:57:51.566
Audience Member: Do you have to
tape and retape several times

00:57:51.566 --> 00:57:56.566
to get it to where you want it (crosstalk)

00:57:56.566 --> 00:57:57.777
Sal: Oh quality?

00:57:57.777 --> 00:57:58.662
Audience Member: Yeah.

00:57:58.662 --> 00:57:59.983
Sal: How many times do I have to -

00:57:59.983 --> 00:58:01.734
When I started, since
it was for my cousins,

00:58:01.734 --> 00:58:05.816
I literally would record
it and put up. (laughter)

00:58:05.816 --> 00:58:08.621
There's actually one or two videos
where I'm answering telemarketer calls.

00:58:08.621 --> 00:58:10.290
(laughter) I didn't care.

00:58:10.290 --> 00:58:11.234
Why re-record it?

00:58:11.234 --> 00:58:12.193
It's for Nadia.

00:58:12.193 --> 00:58:14.961
This is free (unintelligible).

00:58:14.961 --> 00:58:16.294
That's another takeaway.

00:58:16.294 --> 00:58:20.225
People like that
informality, they like that -

00:58:20.225 --> 00:58:21.766
I make mistakes.

00:58:21.766 --> 00:58:24.560
I would say one out of every
12 videos I make on arithmetic,

00:58:24.560 --> 00:58:27.395
I forget a negative number
or I forget a negative sign

00:58:27.395 --> 00:58:30.016
or I say 16-8 is 5.

00:58:30.016 --> 00:58:34.016
I do something bizarre and people
really like that. (laughter)

00:58:34.016 --> 00:58:36.598
Or I start a problem and go
around the wrong path first

00:58:36.598 --> 00:58:39.046
and I say, "Oh wait, that's not right."

00:58:39.046 --> 00:58:42.213
I've gotten positive feedback on
those things because you never see it.

00:58:42.213 --> 00:58:45.153
When you go to a class, the
teacher they have the script,

00:58:45.153 --> 00:58:47.546
they've done that problem 20
times and they just do it perfect.

00:58:47.546 --> 00:58:51.595
You're an idiot if you didn't
see this, obvious steps,

00:58:51.595 --> 00:58:53.695
but when you see someone who
kind of knows what they're doing,

00:58:53.695 --> 00:58:55.831
they follow their intuition in
one direction, it was wrong,

00:58:55.831 --> 00:58:59.068
that's okay, that's the art of
mathematics, of solving a problem.

00:58:59.068 --> 00:59:02.242
Then you go down a complete other path.

00:59:02.242 --> 00:59:05.409
I try now that it's
getting more notoriety,

00:59:05.409 --> 00:59:07.177
I feel like, "Oh my God, so many
people are going to watch this video,

00:59:07.177 --> 00:59:10.807
"let me re-do it," but I find
the more I think that way

00:59:10.807 --> 00:59:14.061
it hurts the quality of the video.

00:59:14.061 --> 00:59:15.556
Audience Member: Does Kaplan or any

00:59:15.556 --> 00:59:18.390
of the other paid for online
services, Phoenix University,

00:59:18.390 --> 00:59:22.561
do any of them view you as a
competitive threat, being free?

00:59:22.561 --> 00:59:28.305
Sal: They should. (laughter)

00:59:28.305 --> 00:59:30.721
I've actually spoke to the
research group at Apollo Group,

00:59:30.721 --> 00:59:33.943
which is the parent company
for the University of Phoenix.

00:59:33.943 --> 00:59:36.442
I think they're aware of it now.

00:59:36.442 --> 00:59:38.610
I've talked to Princeton
Review about potentially -

00:59:38.610 --> 00:59:39.580
Because I would like to do something

00:59:39.580 --> 00:59:42.137
with their materials and all of that.

00:59:42.137 --> 00:59:44.971
In any of these groups,
even textbook publishers,

00:59:44.971 --> 00:59:49.590
I've talked to a few, there's a group
that's very insecure about everything,

00:59:49.590 --> 00:59:53.388
but there's another view that's
like, "Look, this is out there

00:59:53.388 --> 00:59:55.532
"and this could even
empower your instruction."

00:59:55.532 --> 00:59:57.994
If I do all the SAT
problems out of your book,

00:59:57.994 --> 01:00:00.305
hopefully you'll donate
to me and I can do them,

01:00:00.305 --> 01:00:01.722
that's not going to
prevent people from taking

01:00:01.722 --> 01:00:03.137
your Princeton Review course.

01:00:03.137 --> 01:00:04.888
It's going to make your time
in your Princeton Review course

01:00:04.888 --> 01:00:07.875
way more productive, because the
kids will have done the problems,

01:00:07.875 --> 01:00:10.411
get all their questions
answered by this Sal guy

01:00:10.411 --> 01:00:11.913
and then they can have
this one-on-one interaction

01:00:11.913 --> 01:00:17.102
with the guy you're paying to teach.

01:00:17.102 --> 01:00:19.628
I've talked to Princeton
Review and the Apollo Group

01:00:19.628 --> 01:00:22.509
who definitely believe that, but
then they have to fight the inertia

01:00:22.509 --> 01:00:27.710
of we have this billion dollar
franchise, we can't mess it up.

01:00:27.710 --> 01:00:29.042
Once they really view me as a competitor,

01:00:29.042 --> 01:00:32.562
then I'll start getting
security. (laughter)

01:00:32.562 --> 01:00:34.863
Audience Member: Hi, I'm
wondering if you can speak

01:00:34.863 --> 01:00:38.569
on anything more to how you devised
the content for your videos.

01:00:38.569 --> 01:00:41.670
Are you looking at textbooks
and here's the order of content,

01:00:41.670 --> 01:00:43.779
because you're not a fan of textbooks.

01:00:43.779 --> 01:00:47.694
I'm wondering if there's a
potential to reconceptualize

01:00:47.694 --> 01:00:50.029
the way knowledge is
organized to begin with,

01:00:50.029 --> 01:00:53.114
because I was lucky, I could
follow textbooks very well,

01:00:53.114 --> 01:00:58.278
but our natural curiosities
don't follow (unintelligible).

01:00:58.278 --> 01:01:01.559
Early childhood educators are
very often going to have that.

01:01:01.559 --> 01:01:04.028
You go to class
(unintelligible) and it's killed

01:01:04.028 --> 01:01:06.729
many children's natural curiosities.

01:01:06.729 --> 01:01:09.613
How can you link the
basics that you're teaching

01:01:09.613 --> 01:01:12.186
to the real world questions that we have?

01:01:12.186 --> 01:01:16.528
(unintelligible)

01:01:16.528 --> 01:01:18.321
Sal: The question is how
do I build the curriculum?

01:01:18.321 --> 01:01:21.530
How do I decide what to cover,
given that I'm not a fan -

01:01:21.530 --> 01:01:23.813
I'm not a fan of a textbook
as a primary learning source

01:01:23.813 --> 01:01:25.091
for someone who's -

01:01:25.091 --> 01:01:27.496
I do look at textbooks.

01:01:27.496 --> 01:01:32.723
I don't go straight, section 12-1, next
lecture, section 12-2, next lecture.

01:01:32.723 --> 01:01:33.943
Actually, there's a textbook publisher

01:01:33.943 --> 01:01:35.993
who wanted me to do videos for their book

01:01:35.993 --> 01:01:40.332
and they said, "I want you to do
exactly this concept on this video."

01:01:40.332 --> 01:01:43.779
I looked at that concept, I was like,
"There's no way I can get myself

01:01:43.779 --> 01:01:45.403
- It would be so boring.

01:01:45.403 --> 01:01:47.695
It would be just so mundane it
would just kill all my credibility

01:01:47.695 --> 01:01:49.973
if I were to do a video on that.

01:01:49.973 --> 01:01:52.364
My thing is I try to get the big picture

01:01:52.364 --> 01:01:53.505
(unintelligible) with
the French Revolution.

01:01:53.505 --> 01:01:56.038
Spend some time, mull over it, and
then once you have the big picture,

01:01:56.038 --> 01:02:00.288
then try to take the nuggets that
will build you the big picture.

01:02:00.288 --> 01:02:02.979
Then maybe use the
textbook or something else

01:02:02.979 --> 01:02:04.372
just to make sure you're comprehenseive.

01:02:04.372 --> 01:02:06.747
The kid's going to see
everything that they might face

01:02:06.747 --> 01:02:08.316
when they take an assessment.

01:02:08.316 --> 01:02:12.871
I use a ton of Wikipedia, I use textbooks,

01:02:12.871 --> 01:02:17.827
I use other open
courseware sometimes, to -

01:02:17.827 --> 01:02:19.893
A lot of stuff is hard to consume.

01:02:19.893 --> 01:02:21.619
You really have to be motivated to consume

01:02:21.619 --> 01:02:25.204
or already even have a foundation
to consume a lot of these things.

01:02:25.204 --> 01:02:27.399
I feel my value-added
is taking all of that

01:02:27.399 --> 01:02:31.840
and distilling it down
to something useful.

01:02:31.840 --> 01:02:46.821
Audience Member: In your model up there
you have a figure (unintelligible)

01:02:46.821 --> 01:02:54.288
How have you thought of looking
at environmental (unintelligible)

01:02:54.288 --> 01:02:57.536
Stress can be measured in
learning by somebody blinking or -

01:02:57.536 --> 01:03:03.237
(unintelligible)

01:03:03.237 --> 01:03:04.672
Sal: The question is right
now I'm just tracking

01:03:04.672 --> 01:03:06.620
when they're doing the problem,
how long it's taking them,

01:03:06.620 --> 01:03:08.454
what time of day they're doing it,
did they get it right or wrong,

01:03:08.454 --> 01:03:10.296
did they click the hint,
all that type of stuff,

01:03:10.296 --> 01:03:12.647
but there's this whole what
was their blood pressure

01:03:12.647 --> 01:03:14.113
while they were doing
the problem, (laughter)

01:03:14.113 --> 01:03:16.817
where did their eyes move,

01:03:16.817 --> 01:03:20.705
what is their cycles in
their brain doing on an EEG?

01:03:20.705 --> 01:03:22.491
I think that'd be awesome.

01:03:22.491 --> 01:03:25.786
You could do some biofeedback stuff.

01:03:25.786 --> 01:03:28.163
That's a whole frontier that I think is -

01:03:28.163 --> 01:03:29.802
Audience Member: The only
bad thing is you don't want

01:03:29.802 --> 01:03:33.620
to hook somebody up to
an EEG (unintelligible)

01:03:33.620 --> 01:03:40.037
Sal: (unintelligible) If it can be
done, try it out and see if it -

01:03:40.037 --> 01:03:41.900
I think that'd be awesome.

01:03:41.900 --> 01:03:44.015
Camerawoman: There's research
already in effective computing

01:03:44.015 --> 01:03:46.313
in Media Lab and Rosalind Picard.

01:03:46.313 --> 01:03:51.876
That's what (crosstalk)
She was my adviser.

01:03:51.876 --> 01:04:00.209
Then they do sweat measurement
and eye dilation (crosstalk)

01:04:00.209 --> 01:04:02.378
Sal: I think the fun thing about
this, what I view as the Khan Academy,

01:04:02.378 --> 01:04:04.097
right now it's very content focused.

01:04:04.097 --> 01:04:05.666
Everything I talked about was the videos

01:04:05.666 --> 01:04:07.961
and these modules and all of
that, but where I see it going

01:04:07.961 --> 01:04:10.570
is the content is really just seeding.

01:04:10.570 --> 01:04:12.840
In order to do all this data
stuff, you need the content,

01:04:12.840 --> 01:04:16.010
but once you have a critical mass of
content, then the data takes over.

01:04:16.010 --> 01:04:17.845
You can start doing some
really fascinating things

01:04:17.845 --> 01:04:21.378
with experiments that you
couldn't have done before

01:04:21.378 --> 01:04:25.287
and real-time learning and biofeedback
and all this other (unintelligible)

01:04:25.287 --> 01:04:28.323
I think that'd be awesome.

01:04:28.323 --> 01:04:29.655
Audience Member: In the
beginning of your talk

01:04:29.655 --> 01:04:35.831
you said your visitors to your
website surpass MIT (unintelligible)

01:04:35.831 --> 01:04:36.765
Is that true?

01:04:36.765 --> 01:04:39.099
Sal: I'll give you all my data.

01:04:39.099 --> 01:04:42.876
Audience Member: (unintelligible)

01:04:42.876 --> 01:04:47.575
Sal: How do I know that
it's past (unintelligible)

01:04:47.575 --> 01:04:49.508
Audience Member: (unintelligible)

01:04:49.508 --> 01:04:50.459
Sal: There's a couple things.

01:04:50.459 --> 01:04:51.959
There's an interesting thing about -

01:04:51.959 --> 01:04:55.293
Just on YouTube, which I think
is the primary consumption area

01:04:55.293 --> 01:04:59.209
for most open courseware,
it has passed up MIT.

01:04:59.209 --> 01:05:04.126
You can actually look at the cumulative
upload views on a daily basis

01:05:04.126 --> 01:05:07.094
and just measure the delta and you can see

01:05:07.094 --> 01:05:09.998
that Khan Academy's
getting about 60 or 70,000,

01:05:09.998 --> 01:05:12.265
MIT's getting about 30 to 40,000.

01:05:12.265 --> 01:05:17.103
I think next up is Berkeley's getting
15,000 or something like that.

01:05:17.103 --> 01:05:19.128
That's just on that.

01:05:19.128 --> 01:05:23.409
I don't have access to
MIT's actual weblogs.

01:05:23.409 --> 01:05:29.746
(unintelligible) Definitely on
the internet, I'm not 100% sure.

01:05:29.746 --> 01:05:32.190
Audience Member: It's
definitely a different audience.

01:05:32.190 --> 01:05:33.653
Sal: That's the other interesting thing.

01:05:33.653 --> 01:05:35.103
There's all this open courseware,

01:05:35.103 --> 01:05:37.925
people spend millions of
dollars putting cameras in,

01:05:37.925 --> 01:05:40.436
but Khan Academy's really only
the game in town for K through 12,

01:05:40.436 --> 01:05:42.762
which is where all the need is.

01:05:42.762 --> 01:05:44.631
It's not like I'm like, "Oh, MIT ...

01:05:44.631 --> 01:05:47.267
They're catering to us.

01:05:47.267 --> 01:05:51.186
If we took 1806 already and we
just want to review something,

01:05:51.186 --> 01:05:53.806
we can consume that, but
that's not for a ninth grader

01:05:53.806 --> 01:05:56.309
who wants to learn how to learn a matrix.

01:05:56.309 --> 01:05:58.809
For K through 12, I
think that's one reason

01:05:58.809 --> 01:06:01.914
why Khan Academy has picked up,

01:06:01.914 --> 01:06:04.184
because it is directly
addressing its audience.

01:06:04.184 --> 01:06:07.820
I think, on top of that, the
open courseware movement,

01:06:07.820 --> 01:06:10.936
which I think is awesome,
but their first time

01:06:10.936 --> 01:06:12.686
it let's put videos in classrooms.

01:06:12.686 --> 01:06:14.160
They didn't rethink the form factor.

01:06:14.160 --> 01:06:16.463
They didn't say, "Well, is this
really the best way to learn online?"

01:06:16.463 --> 01:06:17.928
We're just saying, "We're
going to show you what goes on

01:06:17.928 --> 01:06:20.232
in an MIT classroom,"
which I think is awesome.

01:06:20.232 --> 01:06:23.732
Audience Member: When it first
came out, it was revolutionary.

01:06:23.732 --> 01:06:24.676
Sal: No, it was.

01:06:24.676 --> 01:06:26.209
That was my proudest day as an alum.

01:06:26.209 --> 01:06:28.583
Audience Member: What I
found is that it seemed to be

01:06:28.583 --> 01:06:30.113
dumping all this information.

01:06:30.113 --> 01:06:33.450
Sal: Yeah, there's two things
that it's going when you go there.

01:06:33.450 --> 01:06:35.519
One is it's hard to navigate.

01:06:35.519 --> 01:06:37.421
You don't know what to watch next,

01:06:37.421 --> 01:06:39.648
so it's not for someone
who's never seen it before.

01:06:39.648 --> 01:06:41.390
There's no direct path
and the other thing is

01:06:41.390 --> 01:06:44.293
even when I was making videos I was
doing the (unintelligible) video.

01:06:44.293 --> 01:06:47.433
This whole time I was like
(unintelligible) MIT stuff.

01:06:47.433 --> 01:06:48.815
I went to the thermodynamics lectures

01:06:48.815 --> 01:06:51.814
and I had to sift through
so much non-entropy talk

01:06:51.814 --> 01:06:53.773
to finally get to entropy
and then finally there was

01:06:53.773 --> 01:06:56.065
an exactly what I want, so
it's very hard to consume.

01:06:56.065 --> 01:06:58.482
Even when you watch the video, I'm not -

01:06:58.482 --> 01:07:00.010
I think it was an awesome thing,

01:07:00.010 --> 01:07:01.565
especially because in 2000 or 2001,

01:07:01.565 --> 01:07:03.732
every other university was doing some type

01:07:03.732 --> 01:07:06.982
of for profit, University
of Phoenix-ish type of thing

01:07:06.982 --> 01:07:09.121
and MIT, it's going to be free.

01:07:09.121 --> 01:07:12.357
I think it's awesome, but
if you watch the videos,

01:07:12.357 --> 01:07:14.897
I probably watched, I think
more than any of you all,

01:07:14.897 --> 01:07:16.730
I watched more open courseware videos.

01:07:16.730 --> 01:07:19.796
Every now and then, the
professor puts up a slide

01:07:19.796 --> 01:07:22.427
that's like, "This is a copyright
issue, you cannot see what this -

01:07:22.427 --> 01:07:26.481
I'm like, "Oh my God, how am I
going to understand?" (laughter)

01:07:26.481 --> 01:07:29.039
It happens one out of every five videos.

01:07:29.039 --> 01:07:31.732
Or the camera is just
not where it should be.

01:07:31.732 --> 01:07:35.278
You can't see -

01:07:35.278 --> 01:07:37.315
I think it's awesome for
other universities to see

01:07:37.315 --> 01:07:39.926
what MIT is doing and it
takes a lot of security

01:07:39.926 --> 01:07:41.686
on the part of MIT to do that -

01:07:41.686 --> 01:07:46.056
Audience Member: It takes some
confidence to release (crosstalk)

01:07:46.056 --> 01:07:48.065
Everything you have, basically.

01:07:48.065 --> 01:07:50.648
Sal: Because it says there's
a value of being here

01:07:50.648 --> 01:07:53.315
and also it's, "Look,
this leaves us open,"

01:07:53.315 --> 01:07:54.897
because before this, everyone would think

01:07:54.897 --> 01:07:57.602
all these secret things are
happening at MIT that are special,

01:07:57.602 --> 01:07:59.815
but now you know exactly what's happening

01:07:59.815 --> 01:08:04.565
and it loses the (unintelligible)
mystique of (unintelligible)

01:08:04.565 --> 01:08:08.345
I agree, but I talked to open courseware

01:08:08.345 --> 01:08:10.514
and I'm open to talking to
them as much as possible.

01:08:10.514 --> 01:08:13.482
I asked them, "Hey, how
about Khan Academy becomes

01:08:13.482 --> 01:08:15.565
"your K through 12 offering?

01:08:15.565 --> 01:08:17.449
"Because this will help recruit
kids, get them interested,

01:08:17.449 --> 01:08:19.947
"I'm an alum and we could get other -

01:08:19.947 --> 01:08:24.047
They were putting video cameras
in the classrooms right now,

01:08:24.047 --> 01:08:27.104
but hopefully that changes.

01:08:27.104 --> 01:08:29.107
I think I would love to
recruit other professors

01:08:29.107 --> 01:08:31.067
to do this form factor,
get other students,

01:08:31.067 --> 01:08:33.977
get you all to do whatever
you all want to do.

01:08:33.977 --> 01:08:41.629
Audience Member:
(unintelligible) (laughter)

01:08:41.629 --> 01:08:42.987
Sal: The questions is how much
of the success of the site

01:08:42.987 --> 01:08:46.212
related to the incompetency of teachers?

01:08:46.212 --> 01:08:50.094
This is a sensitive subject. (laughter)

01:08:50.094 --> 01:08:53.301
Audience Member: (unintelligible)

01:08:53.301 --> 01:08:55.095
Sal: How many teachers
are in the - (laughter)

01:08:55.095 --> 01:08:58.760
The reality is there
are incompetent anybody,

01:08:58.760 --> 01:09:01.260
there are incompetent x, and
unfortunately, some kids,

01:09:01.260 --> 01:09:03.810
that's all they get and I
think there's a lot of that.

01:09:03.810 --> 01:09:05.379
Just look at the -

01:09:05.379 --> 01:09:06.880
The only comments I delete from the site

01:09:06.880 --> 01:09:09.096
are when there's profane
language and even those,

01:09:09.096 --> 01:09:10.483
some I don't get to.

01:09:10.483 --> 01:09:12.451
These are unedited
comments and you'll see,

01:09:12.451 --> 01:09:15.678
on pretty much every video,
at least half the comments

01:09:15.678 --> 01:09:18.558
are some kid who's angry that
they're paying x thousand dollars

01:09:18.558 --> 01:09:22.130
in tuition to whatever and
they spent a whole semester

01:09:22.130 --> 01:09:25.011
trying to learn it and they
thought it was impossible to learn,

01:09:25.011 --> 01:09:27.760
they spent ten minutes on some
video and that's all it was

01:09:27.760 --> 01:09:31.676
and they're angry, they genuinely
want to kill somebody. (laughter)

01:09:31.676 --> 01:09:33.928
I think that's out there.

01:09:33.928 --> 01:09:35.877
A professor in Montreal
wrote a blog post about this.

01:09:35.877 --> 01:09:39.866
It's just like even if you say
this above average instruction.

01:09:39.866 --> 01:09:42.794
We can debate is it better than
90%, is it better than 50%,

01:09:42.794 --> 01:09:44.393
but even if it's above
average instruction,

01:09:44.393 --> 01:09:46.701
even if this instruction
better than 50% of instructors,

01:09:46.701 --> 01:09:49.393
what's the point of having
those 50% of instructors.

01:09:49.393 --> 01:09:52.383
It's a thought experiment
that should happen.

01:09:52.383 --> 01:09:56.342
Even if I'm not the 95th
% instructor, someone is.

01:09:56.342 --> 01:09:57.675
Then you get that person,

01:09:57.675 --> 01:09:59.675
or someone's the 99th
percentile instructor

01:09:59.675 --> 01:10:01.363
and if you have that person,
then why are you having

01:10:01.363 --> 01:10:08.704
the other 99 out of 100 delivering
lectures, but there is -

01:10:08.704 --> 01:10:11.270
It goes into a lot of teachers
are a product of the same system.

01:10:11.270 --> 01:10:13.477
They're products of where
they don't have the intuitions

01:10:13.477 --> 01:10:15.879
and the connections and because
of that, they're passing on

01:10:15.879 --> 01:10:21.003
this rote, superficial understanding
of things for generations.

01:10:21.003 --> 01:11:09.848
Audience Member: (unintelligible)

01:11:09.848 --> 01:11:13.307
Sal: The question, I think,
is is it just going to be me

01:11:13.307 --> 01:11:17.133
or are there other potential people?

01:11:17.133 --> 01:11:20.910
Even the top notch thing, it's
not clear that MIT instruction

01:11:20.910 --> 01:11:25.245
is better than what you're
going to get at the local high -

01:11:25.245 --> 01:11:27.344
Those guys are going to be kick butt,

01:11:27.344 --> 01:11:29.455
in terms of the research
they're doing and all of that,

01:11:29.455 --> 01:11:32.372
but instruction that might
be ideal for an MIT student,

01:11:32.372 --> 01:11:34.150
some of the MIT lectures,
I think they're confident

01:11:34.150 --> 01:11:40.156
because they say, "Look how
hard this class is." (laughter)

01:11:40.156 --> 01:11:42.455
The question about other instructors,

01:11:42.455 --> 01:11:45.329
when I started this, I assumed
that was going to be the case.

01:11:45.329 --> 01:11:47.899
I assumed that I had done
30 videos and I was like,

01:11:47.899 --> 01:11:49.565
"Oh, this is fun and
people are watching it.

01:11:49.565 --> 01:11:52.122
"Let me get my other buddies from
MIT and they'll make some videos

01:11:52.122 --> 01:11:54.071
"and I'll see if they're interested."

01:11:54.071 --> 01:11:55.705
Some were interested,
but it was harder for me

01:11:55.705 --> 01:11:59.205
to get people to do videos than
for me to just do them myself.

01:11:59.205 --> 01:12:02.931
After some point, I had
maybe 100 or 200 videos

01:12:02.931 --> 01:12:05.405
and I said, "This is algebra,
it's pretty much done."

01:12:05.405 --> 01:12:09.776
I said, "I'm just going to keep
going," but I'm open to it.

01:12:09.776 --> 01:12:12.155
If someone wants to -

01:12:12.155 --> 01:12:13.488
A couple people have volunteered, I said,

01:12:13.488 --> 01:12:14.655
"Make 50 videos.

01:12:14.655 --> 01:12:17.100
"If I think those 50 videos
are of the same stock -

01:12:17.100 --> 01:12:19.136
Even if they don't get
associated with Khan Academy,

01:12:19.136 --> 01:12:21.069
they're going to have value by themselves.

01:12:21.069 --> 01:12:22.820
They're going to be on YouTube,
the world can access them.

01:12:22.820 --> 01:12:24.902
If I think they're of the same
style and they're coherent

01:12:24.902 --> 01:12:26.808
with this brand, I'll
push traffic that way,

01:12:26.808 --> 01:12:29.143
especially there's a guy who
just contacted me about music.

01:12:29.143 --> 01:12:30.286
He wants to do a music video.

01:12:30.286 --> 01:12:33.321
I don't know anything about
music (unintelligible)

01:12:33.321 --> 01:12:34.736
until you teach me about music.

01:12:34.736 --> 01:12:39.488
I'm open to it, but I don't
think it's something I could put

01:12:39.488 --> 01:12:43.738
a job posting for (unintelligible)

01:12:43.738 --> 01:12:45.905
The other thing is a lot
of very good instructors

01:12:45.905 --> 01:12:48.071
freeze up a little bit
in this form factor,

01:12:48.071 --> 01:12:50.738
because you are putting
yourself out there.

01:12:50.738 --> 01:12:54.321
If you're a Nobel Prize
PhD, it's a lot harder

01:12:54.321 --> 01:12:56.039
when someone criticizes you than me.

01:12:56.039 --> 01:12:59.106
I'm just a guy, but when
you're the authority,

01:12:59.106 --> 01:13:00.879
to put yourself out there in that way,

01:13:00.879 --> 01:13:04.346
sometimes a little daunting to -

01:13:04.346 --> 01:13:05.571
Audience Member: I don't
know if this is for you

01:13:05.571 --> 01:13:07.071
or your crack programming team,

01:13:07.071 --> 01:13:10.152
but how far away are you from
having forget the videos,

01:13:10.152 --> 01:13:13.926
at least the drilling module
for high school algebra one

01:13:13.926 --> 01:13:16.739
on a DS or an iPod Touch?

01:13:16.739 --> 01:13:19.527
Sal: How far is the module from a -

01:13:19.527 --> 01:13:21.155
Audience Member: Having
a complete drill set,

01:13:21.155 --> 01:13:23.199
all the questions, all the metrics,

01:13:23.199 --> 01:13:25.034
everything being able to load.

01:13:25.034 --> 01:13:30.138
Put junior in the back of the
minivan and do two problems

01:13:30.138 --> 01:13:33.208
every 15 minutes or every five minutes

01:13:33.208 --> 01:13:37.155
and teach junior algebra one
in the back of the minivan,

01:13:37.155 --> 01:13:39.049
all year, not having to go to class.

01:13:39.049 --> 01:13:44.980
Sal: Oh yeah, iPad
(unintelligible) iPad expert.

01:13:44.980 --> 01:13:47.039
I think it's literally -

01:13:47.039 --> 01:13:52.444
We don't have but one developer
for six months devoted on that

01:13:52.444 --> 01:13:54.610
would probably be able to migrate -

01:13:54.610 --> 01:13:55.559
Audience Member: Would
the data fit, though?

01:13:55.559 --> 01:13:56.826
How much data would you need for that?

01:13:56.826 --> 01:13:59.760
Sal: I think it's just a matter of
syncing it and that type of thing,

01:13:59.760 --> 01:14:01.778
it'd just be implementation,
but I think it could easily

01:14:01.778 --> 01:14:04.778
be consumed and done, especially
on an iPad or something like that.

01:14:04.778 --> 01:14:08.028
There's no reason why
that shouldn't be done.

01:14:08.028 --> 01:14:09.406
Audience Member: You're non-profit, right?

01:14:09.406 --> 01:14:10.055
Sal: Yes.

01:14:10.055 --> 01:14:11.507
Audience Member: Do
you see yourself moving

01:14:11.507 --> 01:14:14.809
to a revenue model and
have another approach?

01:14:14.809 --> 01:14:18.028
Sal: Yeah, I'm surprised it
took this long (laughter)

01:14:18.028 --> 01:14:23.195
(unintelligible)

01:14:23.195 --> 01:14:27.323
It's a not for profit, 51C3,
and it was interesting,

01:14:27.323 --> 01:14:29.193
because about a year ago,
before I quit my job,

01:14:29.193 --> 01:14:31.126
I wanted to quit my job.

01:14:31.126 --> 01:14:32.507
It was a good job, but
I wanted to do this,

01:14:32.507 --> 01:14:35.090
and some PCs had contacted me saying,

01:14:35.090 --> 01:14:36.340
"Hey, we love what you're doing

01:14:36.340 --> 01:14:37.674
"and we think you're
doing education right.

01:14:37.674 --> 01:14:39.505
"How about we do a hybrid model?

01:14:39.505 --> 01:14:41.839
"You're going to get a
salary and you can do this.

01:14:41.839 --> 01:14:45.924
" We'll have some premium
content or this or that,"

01:14:45.924 --> 01:14:50.380
and I was very close to doing that,

01:14:50.380 --> 01:14:52.619
but then the more and
more I thought about it,

01:14:52.619 --> 01:14:54.950
especially when I spoke to
them, I knew that at some point

01:14:54.950 --> 01:15:01.173
our desires were going to
conflict and my worst nightmare

01:15:01.173 --> 01:15:04.726
is that all these videos I
did, all of this gets acquired

01:15:04.726 --> 01:15:07.231
by McGraw-Hill (laughter)
and it gets thrown

01:15:07.231 --> 01:15:11.153
in some library someplace and
just disappears from the planet.

01:15:11.153 --> 01:15:13.840
For me, the real joy of this,
even if I'm forced to drive

01:15:13.840 --> 01:15:17.673
a used Honda my entire life, is
that my great-great-grandkids

01:15:17.673 --> 01:15:20.340
might be able to learn
calculus from these videos.

01:15:20.340 --> 01:15:23.675
That, to me, is the most
tremendously exciting powerful thing.

01:15:23.675 --> 01:15:28.285
It is not for profit, it was being funded
by my bank account until very recently.

01:15:28.285 --> 01:15:32.220
Actually, last week, Ann and John Doerr

01:15:32.220 --> 01:15:35.396
wrote a $100,000 check
to give me a salary,

01:15:35.396 --> 01:15:39.561
so you don't have to do too much.

01:15:39.561 --> 01:15:43.871
I'll take some sandwiches, but I'm okay.

01:15:43.871 --> 01:15:45.869
I'm talking to some fairly
large corporations now

01:15:45.869 --> 01:15:47.257
that they're like, "Yeah, this -

01:15:47.257 --> 01:15:53.041
I tell them, "Show me a higher
social return on an investment."

01:15:53.041 --> 01:15:57.339
Get half a million dollar budget,
we'll have three, four developers,

01:15:57.339 --> 01:16:00.117
we can educate millions
of kids for all time.

01:16:00.117 --> 01:16:01.590
It's not like this is a charter school

01:16:01.590 --> 01:16:04.220
and as soon as the money
disappears the school disappears.

01:16:04.220 --> 01:16:05.730
As long as someone's paying $50 a month

01:16:05.730 --> 01:16:09.089
for the web hosting (laughter)
it's going to exist forever.

01:16:09.089 --> 01:16:12.255
Now it's being replicated on this, it's
getting on all sorts of hard drives

01:16:12.255 --> 01:16:13.895
and we're going to put it on
BitTorrent and all of that,

01:16:13.895 --> 01:16:15.965
so we don't even have to
pay for the web hosting.

01:16:15.965 --> 01:16:18.867
You're building a library that can
continue to deliver social returns.

01:16:18.867 --> 01:16:23.240
You do any type of (unintelligible)
it's like $500,000 per year investment,

01:16:23.240 --> 01:16:26.509
the social return is going to be,
especially if you translate it

01:16:26.509 --> 01:16:30.884
into five languages, it's
like $5 billion a year,

01:16:30.884 --> 01:16:32.674
if you associate a video view with $1.

01:16:32.674 --> 01:16:36.175
It's ridiculous and I hope
people are seeing that.

01:16:36.175 --> 01:16:38.010
Hopefully we'll get some.

01:16:38.010 --> 01:16:39.593
Audience Member: (unintelligible)

01:16:39.593 --> 01:16:42.175
Sal: I am not going to
sell out. (laughter)

01:16:42.175 --> 01:16:47.469
There might be a movie one day. (laughter)

01:16:47.469 --> 01:16:48.736
Hopefully I won't sell out.

01:16:48.736 --> 01:16:51.972
Audience Member: To follow
on that a little bit,

01:16:51.972 --> 01:16:54.093
you told us a number
of ways that education

01:16:54.093 --> 01:16:58.414
is entrenched in productive ways.

01:16:58.414 --> 01:17:02.051
Is this interesting in a
way Wikipedia's interesting

01:17:02.051 --> 01:17:04.633
or is it interesting
in ways that can end up

01:17:04.633 --> 01:17:09.490
transforming education as it exists today?

01:17:09.490 --> 01:17:16.699
This would be good supplemental
material (unintelligible) (crosstalk)

01:17:16.699 --> 01:17:18.084
Sal: I'll repeat it.

01:17:18.084 --> 01:17:22.334
The question is do I envision
this as being what Wikipedia is,

01:17:22.334 --> 01:17:25.039
which is a tremendous
impact, but a supplemental,

01:17:25.039 --> 01:17:27.308
nice to have for the
world, or is this something

01:17:27.308 --> 01:17:31.097
that could transform education?

01:17:31.097 --> 01:17:33.093
I think in the short term it's the former,

01:17:33.093 --> 01:17:36.240
but in the long term, and for
me long term is ten years,

01:17:36.240 --> 01:17:37.407
I think it really is -

01:17:37.407 --> 01:17:40.210
A big part of this, I view
this as the operating system

01:17:40.210 --> 01:17:41.844
with the DNA for a physical school

01:17:41.844 --> 01:17:46.928
and I actually do a little summer
camp, really for me to experiment

01:17:46.928 --> 01:17:49.594
with what you do with the
rest of the school day,

01:17:49.594 --> 01:17:51.655
because I can do this for
two hours and then it frees

01:17:51.655 --> 01:17:54.625
the rest of the time for creative things,
to actually write computer programs,

01:17:54.625 --> 01:17:58.657
compose music, paint, to
actually build things.

01:17:58.657 --> 01:18:01.761
My goal is that summer
camp's going to get longer

01:18:01.761 --> 01:18:04.067
and longer and longer. (laughter)

01:18:04.067 --> 01:18:07.703
Actually, the San Jose Tech Museum
is going to give us some space.

01:18:07.703 --> 01:18:11.119
We're going to start
having a presence there.

01:18:11.119 --> 01:18:14.457
That physical experiment's going
to get more and more substantial

01:18:14.457 --> 01:18:15.883
and at some point, we're going to be like,

01:18:15.883 --> 01:18:18.496
"We're a real school now
and this is the prototype,"

01:18:18.496 --> 01:18:24.048
and I don't want to do it if it's
only 5% better outcomes than what -

01:18:24.048 --> 01:18:28.904
I want kids, "Hey, I just
painted that picture,

01:18:28.904 --> 01:18:31.006
"I just built that robot,
and by the way I'm 12

01:18:31.006 --> 01:18:32.466
"and I'm learning calculus."

01:18:32.466 --> 01:18:35.632
I want to see that and I think
once you have one example of that,

01:18:35.632 --> 01:18:40.716
but I think (unintelligible)
Then I think you set the example

01:18:40.716 --> 01:18:41.966
and I think the rest of the
world's going to be like,

01:18:41.966 --> 01:18:45.354
"Wait, even our $40,000 a year fancy
private school is not doing that

01:18:45.354 --> 01:18:49.326
"and they're charging $5,000
a student," as opposed to -

01:18:49.326 --> 01:18:51.134
Audience Member: Then the
next question that comes,

01:18:51.134 --> 01:18:54.668
if you do that, this seems to
apply to self-selecting students

01:18:54.668 --> 01:18:57.934
who seek out the materials and
even in the case of the camp,

01:18:57.934 --> 01:19:02.298
obviously there's some selection there.

01:19:02.298 --> 01:19:06.765
How applicable are the ideas then of
going through school (unintelligible)

01:19:06.765 --> 01:19:09.227
Sal: Right, the idea is
this is right now applicable

01:19:09.227 --> 01:19:10.634
to a self-selecting pool of students

01:19:10.634 --> 01:19:13.838
and even the summer camp
I'm doing and that's true

01:19:13.838 --> 01:19:16.142
and how do you apply it to a broader -

01:19:16.142 --> 01:19:17.808
I think there's two -

01:19:17.808 --> 01:19:20.709
The summer camp that I
showed the data with,

01:19:20.709 --> 01:19:23.374
the selection criteria was
not kids with a certain IQ

01:19:23.374 --> 01:19:24.710
or kids who've done -

01:19:24.710 --> 01:19:28.101
That was just non-problem kids.

01:19:28.101 --> 01:19:30.628
This was mainly minority
kids from east Palo Alto,

01:19:30.628 --> 01:19:34.709
Redwood City, Menlo Park, who they
didn't have discipline problems,

01:19:34.709 --> 01:19:40.415
but I think that could describe 80%
of students, probably 90% of students.

01:19:40.415 --> 01:19:42.814
I'd say problem the subset
that have discipline problems,

01:19:42.814 --> 01:19:45.252
a lot of it is because they're
not being addressed in this way

01:19:45.252 --> 01:19:46.919
that they have these gaps
and no one can address it

01:19:46.919 --> 01:19:49.189
and there's all sorts of social stigmas.

01:19:49.189 --> 01:19:52.424
It's ridiculous that concepts
and age are associated

01:19:52.424 --> 01:19:54.927
in this tightly linked way that
if you're 13 and you need help

01:19:54.927 --> 01:19:59.332
with decimals you're stupid and
I'm going to make fun of you.

01:19:59.332 --> 01:20:01.464
I think that leads to a lot of
social acting out and all that.

01:20:01.464 --> 01:20:05.048
Actually, I want to get this into prisons,

01:20:05.048 --> 01:20:15.109
because they have a
lot of time. (laughter)

01:20:15.109 --> 01:20:18.246
I don't know the exact answer,
there would be some experimentation,

01:20:18.246 --> 01:20:20.016
but I suspect that this is going to appeal

01:20:20.016 --> 01:20:23.585
to a larger swath
because it's interactive.

01:20:23.585 --> 01:20:25.969
Everything about it, you're
never having to sit passively.

01:20:25.969 --> 01:20:28.139
You're learning the way people
naturally want to learn.

01:20:28.139 --> 01:20:30.859
I think a lot of these
hyperactive kids or whatever,

01:20:30.859 --> 01:20:34.628
they're natural learners, they
just don't like being lectured to.

01:20:34.628 --> 01:20:38.305
They like to be interactive and
talk to their peers and whatnot.

01:20:38.305 --> 01:20:42.964
We'll see where that goes,
but it's an interesting seed.

01:20:42.964 --> 01:20:44.294
It's an interesting question.

01:20:44.294 --> 01:20:46.576
If there is something that can really
accelerate 90% of the students,

01:20:46.576 --> 01:20:48.792
but it leaves behind 10%, is
that a good or a bad thing

01:20:48.792 --> 01:20:53.130
and that's a whole social
debate that one could have.

01:20:53.130 --> 01:20:54.963
Audience Member: In case there
is a movie made about you,

01:20:54.963 --> 01:20:57.988
can the other Salman Khan
play this Salman Khan.

01:20:57.988 --> 01:21:01.158
Sal: Oh yeah, he says,
"Can the other Salman -

01:21:01.158 --> 01:21:03.093
For those who've never done
a web search for Salman Khan,

01:21:03.093 --> 01:21:04.547
I encourage you to do so when you go home,

01:21:04.547 --> 01:21:06.880
because there's an Indian
actor with my name.

01:21:06.880 --> 01:21:12.390
I think that's helped me beat MIT
open courseware, as well. (laughter)

01:21:12.390 --> 01:21:15.424
Audience Member: One issue
you might have thought about,

01:21:15.424 --> 01:21:17.868
I've watched a second
grader in the neighborhood

01:21:17.868 --> 01:21:21.118
who is homeschooled and I'm
afraid he's really missing out

01:21:21.118 --> 01:21:25.901
on the socialization factor.

01:21:25.901 --> 01:21:28.687
If we transition more to
this method of teaching,

01:21:28.687 --> 01:21:31.792
how would we not lose that?

01:21:31.792 --> 01:21:33.734
Sal: Right, so the question's
on socialization factor.

01:21:33.734 --> 01:21:36.150
I want to be very clear,
this is on the internet,

01:21:36.150 --> 01:21:38.432
essentially and someone could
be sitting in an isolated room

01:21:38.432 --> 01:21:40.299
and doing this and not
having any socialization,

01:21:40.299 --> 01:21:44.316
but the goal when I described
the one room schoolhouse

01:21:44.316 --> 01:21:46.214
is that it actually is social.

01:21:46.214 --> 01:21:50.008
For the first time, you actually
do get socialization in a school.

01:21:50.008 --> 01:21:52.735
Most of us, there's a thousand
kids in the schoolhouse,

01:21:52.735 --> 01:21:57.025
but you don't get any interaction,
especially in a meaty way,

01:21:57.025 --> 01:21:59.671
except in recess and lunch, but
now this is actually encouraging

01:21:59.671 --> 01:22:02.194
socialization in the classroom,
where you're tutoring each other.

01:22:02.194 --> 01:22:05.877
That's actually very good socialization.

01:22:05.877 --> 01:22:10.487
If you think about when do you want
to give someone a big thumbs up?

01:22:10.487 --> 01:22:12.821
Right now, the system
says, "Oh, you're a genius,

01:22:12.821 --> 01:22:14.089
"you got an 800 on your SAT."

01:22:14.089 --> 01:22:15.533
That's where you get the thumbs up,

01:22:15.533 --> 01:22:17.356
but the real thumbs up
is you're a good teacher,

01:22:17.356 --> 01:22:19.571
you have empathy, you have maturity.

01:22:19.571 --> 01:22:22.904
When other kids respect you
for your ability to communicate

01:22:22.904 --> 01:22:24.654
and not talk down to them.

01:22:24.654 --> 01:22:28.934
If you think about what
people will get points for,

01:22:28.934 --> 01:22:31.633
I want it to be that, that
the data and assessments show

01:22:31.633 --> 01:22:33.987
that you're a great teacher to your peers.

01:22:33.987 --> 01:22:38.011
If you're an employer or a
university, those are the kids

01:22:38.011 --> 01:22:41.571
you want to admit, not the
kid who's just racing ahead

01:22:41.571 --> 01:22:44.070
and just arrogant and all of that.

01:22:44.070 --> 01:22:49.195
I think it will actually help
socialization, especially
the one room model.

01:22:52.984 --> 01:22:53.890
Oh, yeah.

01:22:53.890 --> 01:22:55.890
Audience Member: When
are you speaking at TED?

01:22:55.890 --> 01:22:59.728
Sal: Oh, the question is when
am I speaking at TED? (laughter)

01:22:59.728 --> 01:23:00.769
I don't know.

01:23:00.769 --> 01:23:03.129
Actually, I just had a - I don't know.

01:23:03.129 --> 01:23:08.268
If they call me I'll go. (laughter)

01:23:08.268 --> 01:23:09.635
I'll be speaking at Pop -

01:23:09.635 --> 01:23:12.338
Have you all heard of PopTech.

01:23:12.338 --> 01:23:13.519
It's this thing in New Hampshire.

01:23:13.519 --> 01:23:15.742
It's like a mini-TED. (laughter)

01:23:15.742 --> 01:23:17.353
Audience Member: Would you
speak at TEDx, if they call you?

01:23:17.353 --> 01:23:19.011
Sal: I'll be good anywhere.

01:23:19.011 --> 01:23:24.750
I speak at the old
(unintelligible) (laughter)

01:23:24.750 --> 01:23:28.000
Excellent, thank you. (applause)
