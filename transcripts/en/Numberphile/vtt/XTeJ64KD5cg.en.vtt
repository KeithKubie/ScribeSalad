00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:03.670
TONY PADILLA: If you actually
tried to picture Graham's

00:00:03.670 --> 00:00:07.740
number in your head, then your
head would collapse to form a

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:08.960
black hole.

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:10.970
That's not just some
sort of crazy sort

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:11.740
of pictorial image--

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:12.270
it would.

00:00:12.270 --> 00:00:13.190
It would--

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:17.010
you couldn't store that much
information in your head.

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:19.620
MATT PARKER: People think
mathematicians just basically

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:21.910
look at bigger and bigger
calculations, and bigger and

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:22.740
bigger numbers--

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:24.250
which is not entirely true.

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:27.430
But Graham's number I love,
because it's the biggest

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:29.370
number that's been used
constructively.

00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:31.300
TONY PADILLA: Well, because
there's a sort of maximum

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:33.250
amount of what we call
entropy that can be

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:34.485
stored in your head.

00:00:34.485 --> 00:00:36.640
And the maximum amount of
entropy you can store in your

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:39.960
head is related to a black hole
the size of your head.

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.830
And the entropy of a black hole
the size of your head

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:46.510
carries less information than
it would take to write out

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:47.290
Graham's number.

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:50.060
So the inevitability is if you
started to try to write out

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:51.980
Graham's number in your head,
then your head would

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:53.810
eventually have so much
information that it would

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:55.127
collapse from a black hole.

00:00:59.897 --> 00:01:04.340
MATT PARKER: If you start with
a small number-- and 3 is a

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:05.800
small number--

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:09.360
what you can do is you can
start adding 3 to itself.

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:14.180
So you could do 3
plus 3 plus 3.

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:14.890
And you can keep going.

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:16.500
In fact, what I've
done here is I've

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.310
multiplied 3 by 3, right?

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:20.820
So you could just
do 3 times 3.

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:21.830
That works just as well.

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:23.330
And if you want, you could
do lots of these.

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:26.550
You could do 3 times
3 times 3.

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:28.230
And you could multiply
it lots of times.

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:32.660
And that's 3 cubed.

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:35.500
TONY PADILLA: OK, and that's 27,
so we're happy with that.

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:36.980
I could write this
another way.

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:40.670
The way I would write this down
in arrow notation would

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:43.765
be I'd write 3 arrow 3.

00:01:43.765 --> 00:01:45.640
And that just means
the same thing--

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:49.030
3 multiplied by itself
3 times.

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:51.250
Hopefully you're still with
me at this stage.

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:53.900
Now, I say, what's
3 double arrow 3?

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:55.775
MATT PARKER: If you do 3 to the
power of 3 to the power of

00:01:55.775 --> 00:01:59.750
3, we would write that as
3 to the power of, to

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:01.500
the power of 3.

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:06.230
TONY PADILLA: This means
3 arrow 3 arrow 3.

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:07.980
Well, 3 arrow 3--

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:14.620
well, we've already seen that
that's 27, so 3 arrow 27.

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:17.090
OK, and 3 arrow 27--

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:19.340
well that's 3 to the
power of 27.

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:20.790
MATT PARKER: And if you actually
work that out, it

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:24.430
comes out to be around
about 7.6 trillion.

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:26.170
Now at this point,
you can go wild.

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:27.710
Right?

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:28.950
How many arrows do you want?

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:32.130
So the next one, let's say
we did 3 to the power of,

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:33.050
to the power of--

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:35.010
or arrow, arrow, arrow,
or whatever you

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:36.950
want to call this--

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:38.060
3.

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:43.830
Well, that is equivalent to 3 to
the double, to the double,

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:46.790
to the 3, to the double,
to the double.

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:49.410
That's 3 to the power of
3, to the power 3, to

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:51.510
the power of 3.

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:52.980
And that stack--

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:57.940
that stack is 7.6 trillion
3s high.

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:00.520
And you start from the top
and work your way down.

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:02.500
And you get an almighty
number.

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:06.430
You get a number that is
absolutely off the chart.

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:08.150
You couldn't write these
numbers down.

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:10.160
You'd run out of pens
in the universe.

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:11.780
Don't forget just
three 3s stacked

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:13.530
together was 7.6 trillion.

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:16.390
Now we've got a stack of 3s
7.6 trillion of them high.

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:19.000
And the question is, why would
you want to know, right?

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.590
And so actually the reason we
have arrow notation is to look

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:22.790
at very huge numbers.

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:25.250
The famous, the quintessential
never-ending--

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:27.020
well, it does end, it's
a finite number--

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:28.320
is Graham's number.

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:30.030
And it's the solution
to a mass problem.

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:33.970
So in math we do things called
combinatorics, where you look

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:34.930
at big combinations.

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:39.100
And we look at networks, which
mathematicians call graphs,

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:42.890
and you look at different ways
of coloring in graphs.

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:46.790
And so mathematicians looked
at ways to color in,

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:48.640
effectively, graphs
that are linked to

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:52.190
higher dimensional cubes.

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:53.510
Bear with me for all this.

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:56.320
You can get cubes in higher
dimensions and look at

00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:57.700
different ways to
color them in.

00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:01.880
And they tried to count the
number of dimensions--

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:02.590
I've got an analogy.

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:04.850
There's a very famous analogy
for how this works.

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:08.800
Imagine you've got a
group of people.

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:11.830
So you could have, for example,
three people trying

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:14.390
to have a relaxing time
drinking champagne.

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:19.450
You can then try and select
committees, or subsets, from

00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:20.230
that group of peoples.

00:04:20.230 --> 00:04:21.769
TONY PADILLA: You could put some
people in one committee,

00:04:21.769 --> 00:04:24.760
some of the people in another
committee, and some people

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:26.720
could be in a few committees,
and there's a whole bunch of

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:29.530
committees that you could
put together.

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:31.530
And then what you do is, you
say, OK, I've got all these

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:32.340
committees.

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:36.930
And I'm going to sort of pick
pairs of committees.

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:41.120
So committees can form pairs,
and each committee can be in

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:43.660
more than one pair, and so on.

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:46.770
And then you say, OK, I've got
all these pairs of committees.

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:48.610
And I'm going to give
them a color--

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:51.210
each pair's going to have
a color, blue or red.

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:52.710
OK.

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:54.480
Now, I ask the question--

00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:58.310
how many people do I need there
to be, in the first

00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:03.930
place, to guarantee that there
are at least four committees

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:05.342
for which--

00:05:05.342 --> 00:05:06.780
let's get this right--

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:08.680
MATT PARKER: There are four--

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:09.920
There are four committees--

00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:12.480
TONY PADILLA: --each pair,
made out of those four

00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:15.430
committees, has the
same color--

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:20.260
MATT PARKER: --and all
people appear in--

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:21.130
I forget.

00:05:21.130 --> 00:05:23.670
TONY PADILLA: --and for which
each member of that committee

00:05:23.670 --> 00:05:25.940
is in an even number
of committees?

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:28.840
MATT PARKER: The ultimate
question is, if I put these

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:33.050
weird conditions on those links
of matching up different

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:35.530
committees, what's the smallest
number of people

00:05:35.530 --> 00:05:37.450
required for that to be true?

00:05:37.450 --> 00:05:41.260
TONY PADILLA: So that's the
question that Graham was

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:44.320
trying to answer in a very
roundabout sort of way.

00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:45.830
So, he said, OK, fine--

00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:47.220
BRADY HARAN: But he wasn't
applying it to committees.

00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:47.770
It was for something--

00:05:47.770 --> 00:05:50.990
TONY PADILLA: No, it was to do
with hyper cubes in higher

00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:53.640
dimensions, but it's the same
question, essentially.

00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:56.130
MATT PARKER: And they worked out
that there is an answer--

00:05:56.130 --> 00:05:57.150
it's not infinite.

00:05:57.150 --> 00:06:00.510
And the answer is not bigger
than Graham's number.

00:06:00.510 --> 00:06:04.790
And Graham's number was
developed in 1971 as being the

00:06:04.790 --> 00:06:07.000
maximum possible number
of people you need

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:08.050
for this to be true.

00:06:08.050 --> 00:06:09.930
And at the same time they
worked out the smallest

00:06:09.930 --> 00:06:12.060
number, which was six.

00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:14.430
So somewhere between
six and Graham's

00:06:14.430 --> 00:06:15.645
number is your answer.

00:06:15.645 --> 00:06:17.940
However, to actually see
Graham's number-- we have some

00:06:17.940 --> 00:06:19.780
more paper--

00:06:19.780 --> 00:06:22.200
we use arrow notation to
get to Graham's number.

00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:24.050
We start--

00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:27.450
and I used 3s for a reason,
because you start with a 3--

00:06:27.450 --> 00:06:29.960
arrow, arrow, arrow, arrow.

00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:33.090
And you call that your first
number, and the notation is to

00:06:33.090 --> 00:06:35.040
call that g1.

00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:37.170
And already don't forget
how mind boggling this

00:06:37.170 --> 00:06:38.750
number was last time.

00:06:38.750 --> 00:06:40.310
This is already off
the chart, right?

00:06:40.310 --> 00:06:42.930
TONY PADILLA: Let's call
this stupidly big.

00:06:42.930 --> 00:06:45.500
OK.

00:06:45.500 --> 00:06:46.240
All right.

00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:47.740
Now we say, well, it's g2.

00:06:47.740 --> 00:06:55.650
Well, g2 is a 3 where we've
got a lot of arrows.

00:06:55.650 --> 00:06:57.260
How many arrows have we got?

00:06:57.260 --> 00:07:00.480
We've got g1 of them.

00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:02.100
So this was stupidly big.

00:07:02.100 --> 00:07:04.380
This is stupidly,
stupidly big.

00:07:04.380 --> 00:07:05.260
Right?

00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:06.200
And then we carry on.

00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:07.870
We do g3.

00:07:07.870 --> 00:07:10.050
And we get a whole
bunch of arrows.

00:07:10.050 --> 00:07:10.810
How many?

00:07:10.810 --> 00:07:13.530
Well, you guessed it--

00:07:13.530 --> 00:07:14.670
g2 of them.

00:07:14.670 --> 00:07:16.860
MATT PARKER: And then, the
thing is, you're getting

00:07:16.860 --> 00:07:20.720
numbers which are beyond
arrow notation, right?

00:07:20.720 --> 00:07:22.230
This is just-- ah.

00:07:22.230 --> 00:07:23.530
And then you keep
going, right?

00:07:23.530 --> 00:07:26.640
And Graham's number is if you
keep doing this, you keep

00:07:26.640 --> 00:07:27.470
doing g's, right?

00:07:27.470 --> 00:07:34.520
You go all the way down to g64
equals Graham's number.

00:07:37.530 --> 00:07:41.205
TONY PADILLA: So it's just
unimaginably big--

00:07:41.205 --> 00:07:42.210
I mean literally.

00:07:42.210 --> 00:07:43.340
That's Graham's number.

00:07:43.340 --> 00:07:45.090
What do we know about
Graham's number?

00:07:45.090 --> 00:07:48.390
Well, we don't know what
its first digit is.

00:07:48.390 --> 00:07:50.850
We do know its last digit.

00:07:50.850 --> 00:07:53.180
Its last digit is 7.

00:07:53.180 --> 00:07:54.860
The part we know about
is the last 500.

00:07:54.860 --> 00:07:56.180
The last one is 7.

00:07:56.180 --> 00:07:57.940
MATT PARKER: People say,
how big is it, right?

00:07:57.940 --> 00:08:01.690
And you can't even describe how
many digits this number--

00:08:01.690 --> 00:08:02.940
you can't.

00:08:04.520 --> 00:08:07.690
The number you would need to say
how many digits there are,

00:08:07.690 --> 00:08:09.560
yourself, you couldn't describe
how many digits.

00:08:09.560 --> 00:08:10.450
And then--

00:08:10.450 --> 00:08:11.280
Ah!

00:08:11.280 --> 00:08:16.000
And so the answer to this
problem is somewhere between 6

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:17.380
and Graham's number.

00:08:17.380 --> 00:08:20.320
Recently, though, mathematicians
have narrowed

00:08:20.320 --> 00:08:21.420
it in even further.

00:08:21.420 --> 00:08:25.070
I think it was early 2000,
someone pulled in to be

00:08:25.070 --> 00:08:27.650
between 11 and Graham's
number.

00:08:27.650 --> 00:08:29.090
So we're narrowing in, right.

00:08:29.090 --> 00:08:30.060
We're gonna get there.

00:08:30.060 --> 00:08:33.630
As far as mathematicians are
concerned, 11 to the biggest

00:08:33.630 --> 00:08:34.669
number ever used

00:08:34.669 --> 00:08:37.419
constructively is quite precise.

00:08:37.419 --> 00:08:39.980
Because no matter how big a
number you think of, right--

00:08:39.980 --> 00:08:41.580
and this is just stupid big--

00:08:41.580 --> 00:08:43.169
it's smaller than infinity.

00:08:43.169 --> 00:08:45.080
There's still an infinite number
of numbers that are

00:08:45.080 --> 00:08:46.450
bigger the Graham's number.

00:08:46.450 --> 00:08:48.180
So, frankly, we've pretty
much nailed it,

00:08:48.180 --> 00:08:49.280
as far as I'm concerned.

00:08:49.280 --> 00:08:51.630
TONY PADILLA: Yeah, I mean it's
not the largest number

00:08:51.630 --> 00:08:53.440
being used in a mathematical
proof.

00:08:53.440 --> 00:08:56.120
There's the sort of tree
theorems that use larger

00:08:56.120 --> 00:08:57.500
numbers, now.

00:08:57.500 --> 00:08:59.350
But you know, back in
the '70s it was.

00:08:59.350 --> 00:09:02.480
Just an interesting anecdote
about Graham himself.

00:09:02.480 --> 00:09:05.280
He was actually a circus
performer as well as a

00:09:05.280 --> 00:09:07.390
mathematician.

00:09:07.390 --> 00:09:09.960
He certainly did a few
circus tricks when he

00:09:09.960 --> 00:09:11.210
came up with this.
