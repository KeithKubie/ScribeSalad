00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:24.090
During the never ceasing rivalry between Coke
and Pepsi, each company has made some spectacularly

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:29.320
bad marketing decisions to try and one up
each other- from Coke’s baffling decision

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:34.760
to spend $100 million to fill cans of their
soda with water that smelled like farts to

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:39.540
Pepsi somehow accidentally promising customers
who bought enough of their soda a harrier

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:40.810
jet.

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:44.930
And don’t even get us started on that time
Coca-Cola decided to stop making their best

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:50.559
selling product, Coca-Cola, because taste
tests, even the ones they conducted, very

00:00:50.559 --> 00:00:54.719
concerningly showed people preferred Pepsi
to Coke and they thought for sure it was only

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:57.899
a matter of time before Pepsi overtook Coca-Cola
in popularity.

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:02.679
So they came up with a new product to give
the brand name to and stopped making what

00:01:02.679 --> 00:01:07.700
had been for decades, and still was at the
time, by far the world’s best selling soft

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:08.700
drink…

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.950
The classic slaughter your troops and burn
your own castle down before your enemy gets

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:13.570
the chance strategy…

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:16.130
We can’t make this stuff up.

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:20.990
This all brings us to the subject of today-
that time Pepsi ran a promotion that resulted

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:25.910
in 800,000 customers being promised $40,000
each.

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:31.009
And for those who don’t want to do the math,
that’s a potential spend of about $32 billion,

00:01:31.009 --> 00:01:35.830
or adjusted for inflation, about $50 billion
in today’s dollars.

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:40.360
The origins of this particular corporate horror
story can be traced back to the early 1990s

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:43.819
when Pepsico were struggling to gain a foothold
in the Philippines.

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:48.110
Noted as being the the 12th biggest market
for soft drink consumption at the time, Coca-Cola

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:52.970
controlled about 75% of that market while
Pepsi only had 17%.

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:57.670
In an effort to push Coke from the throne,
Pepsi enlisted the help of a Mexican marketing

00:01:57.670 --> 00:01:59.390
firm D.G.

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:00.390
Consultores.

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:04.940
Together they workshopped what would eventually
become known as the Number Fever Campaign.

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:09.229
Mechanically the promotion was similar to
other giveaways the soda giant has taken part

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:13.900
in, revolving around the collection of bottle
caps for various Pepsi products, including

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:16.560
Pepsi itself, Mountain Dew and 7-Up.

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:19.670
On these caps was printed a seemingly random
3 digit number.

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:23.620
Each day Pepsi would announce one of these
numbers on Filipino television and a prize,

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:30.000
ranging from 100 pesos (about $4 then or $7
today) to 1,000,000 pesos (about $40,000 then

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.590
or $71,000 today) would be awarded to holders
of the numbers.

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:38.190
To ensure that they didn’t hand out too
many prizes, an algorithm was used to ensure

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:41.819
only a specific amount of winning bottle caps
were printed.

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:46.060
This algorithm was tweaked such that the entire
spend for the prizes on the campaign would

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:48.780
not exceed around $2 million.

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:52.260
To add an air of pomp and circumstance to
the whole ordeal, the winning numbers were

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:57.620
stored in a fancy bank vault and delivered
to a designated TV studio (specifically Channel

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:02.260
2 News in Manilla) each day, though as the
promotion grew other stations picked it up

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:03.430
as well.

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:07.720
Officially launched in the opening months
of 1992, the promotion was a hit and saw sales

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:12.480
of Pepsi products spike by 40% in the region
almost overnight.

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:16.540
In terms of raw market share, at its peak
the additional sales helped Pepsi capture

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:19.580
a further 9% of the Filipino soda market.

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:24.510
In the end, an estimated 31 million Filipinos
bought a promotional Pepsi product during

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:28.850
the time the promotion ran- a number, for
the curious, that amounted to roughly half

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:31.459
the country’s population at the time.

00:03:31.459 --> 00:03:35.360
Speaking of grand prize winners, to ensure
that they had complete control over how many

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:40.209
people won it, Pepsi handed down a list of
“forbidden numbers” to D.G.

00:03:40.209 --> 00:03:45.959
Consultores (who were handling the distribution
side of the promotion) reserved exclusively

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:51.400
for the grand prize that bottlers absolutely
would not print on the inside of caps.

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:55.080
Initially the campaign ran without a hitch
and by May of that year there had been 17

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:58.910
grand prize winners, while thousands more
had won smaller prizes.

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:03.620
This all changed though when on May 25th Channel
2 announced that the final grand prize would

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:09.550
be awarded to anyone holding a bottle cap
with the number 349 printed on it… a number

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:13.770
that was on the list of forbidden numbers
to be picked as a winner, importantly because

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:17.690
it was printed on about 800,000 bottle caps….

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:22.430
Who exactly screwed up here isn’t really
known, though presumably internally someone

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:25.940
missed out on the employee of the month award
on this one.

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:29.900
But whatever the case, as you can imagine,
people holding bottle caps with the number

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:35.849
349 on them were very keen to claim their
rather large prize, with tens of thousands

00:04:35.849 --> 00:04:39.189
of people turning up to Pepsi plants across
the country demanding their money.

00:04:39.189 --> 00:04:40.719
All in all some 486,170 of the 800,000 bottle
caps printed ended up being found, meaning

00:04:40.719 --> 00:04:41.719
Pepsi owed out just shy of $20 billion…

00:04:41.719 --> 00:04:42.719
And just for the curious, as we ourselves
were wondering how that number compared just

00:04:42.719 --> 00:04:48.740
for fun, the entire gross domestic product
of the Philippines that year was about $52

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:49.740
billion.

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:53.139
Unwilling to pay out the billions of dollars
it would cost to honor each winning bottle

00:04:53.139 --> 00:04:57.939
cap, Pepsi instructed officials at the locations
to simply turn people away and claim that

00:04:57.939 --> 00:05:01.139
the number 349 had been announced in error.

00:05:01.139 --> 00:05:05.290
Naturally, when it was announced that no prizes
would be awarded for this number, this caused

00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:09.659
mass outrage and riots broke out at Pepsi
locations across the Philippines.

00:05:09.659 --> 00:05:14.330
To appease the masses, Pepsi announced that
they would offer anyone holding a 349 bottle

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:23.400
cap 500 pesos (about $18 at the time or $32
today) as “a gesture of goodwill”.

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:27.509
How they settled on this number isn’t clear,
but it is noteworthy that this did tack on

00:05:27.509 --> 00:05:33.509
an additional spend of nearly $9 million for
Pepsi, and closer to $17 million if all 800,000

00:05:33.509 --> 00:05:35.879
or so caps were found.

00:05:35.879 --> 00:05:41.129
For some reason people who’d initially been
expecting a literal million peso payday didn’t

00:05:41.129 --> 00:05:45.360
respond well to this offer and thousands of
them filed suit against the company.

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:50.550
One woman, Paciencia Salem, even vowed that
when she died, to quote her, “My ghost will

00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:52.069
come to fight Pepsi.”

00:05:52.069 --> 00:05:56.559
It’s also noteworthy that her husband died
of a heart attack during a Pepsi boycott march

00:05:56.559 --> 00:05:59.120
shortly before she said this in an interview.

00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:03.289
On that note, many chose to take out their
frustrations on the company more directly,

00:06:03.289 --> 00:06:07.809
storming Pepsi offices and bottling plants,
the latter of which were forced to employ

00:06:07.809 --> 00:06:11.939
armed guards and put up barbed wire fences
to keep out angry customers.

00:06:11.939 --> 00:06:16.900
Naturally, Pepsi wasted no time removing non-essential
employees from the country until things calmed

00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:17.930
down.

00:06:17.930 --> 00:06:21.889
Violence against tangible representations
of the company followed with Pepsi delivery

00:06:21.889 --> 00:06:26.289
trucks being a particularly easy target for
the collective wrath of the Filipino people

00:06:26.289 --> 00:06:28.819
with a few dozen of them being destroyed.

00:06:28.819 --> 00:06:33.300
Tragically, one truck was even attacked by
a man with a grenade, which ended up bouncing

00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:37.439
off its target and killing a school teacher
and two children, while severely wounding

00:06:37.439 --> 00:06:38.699
six more people.

00:06:38.699 --> 00:06:43.020
Rather than blame the man who threw the grenade,
many in the masses blamed Pepsi for causing

00:06:43.020 --> 00:06:44.830
the fiasco in the first place.

00:06:44.830 --> 00:06:48.939
Calls for a boycott followed and sales of
Pepsi products nosedived across the country

00:06:48.939 --> 00:06:53.979
as the sustained negative coverage of their
brand and the violence the promotion had caused

00:06:53.979 --> 00:06:55.759
dominated Filipino airwaves.

00:06:55.759 --> 00:07:00.580
However, once again proving that no matter
how big of a screw up you make, when it comes

00:07:00.580 --> 00:07:05.740
to soft drinks particularly, it doesn’t
matter, Pepsi weathered the controversy completely

00:07:05.740 --> 00:07:10.490
and sales recovered to their former levels
once the mobs disbanded and the news moved

00:07:10.490 --> 00:07:11.949
on to other stories.

00:07:11.949 --> 00:07:15.949
And from the legal side of things, Pepsi got
off mostly scot free here as well.

00:07:15.949 --> 00:07:20.689
While they did have to fight thousands of
lawsuits over the issue up until 2006, that

00:07:20.689 --> 00:07:26.110
year a Philippines Supreme Court ruling definitively
cleared them and they didn’t end up having

00:07:26.110 --> 00:08:06.429
to pay anything to any of those who brought
suit against

00:08:06.429 --> 00:08:49.940
the company.
