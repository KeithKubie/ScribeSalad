00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:02.869
(jazzy music)

00:00:06.106 --> 00:00:09.275 align:start position:0%
- Healthy walking, speed
walking, is what you need to do

00:00:09.275 --> 00:00:11.144
in the DC mall.

00:00:11.144 --> 00:00:12.912
Look at these guys right here.

00:00:12.912 --> 00:00:14.614
I need everyone's papers.

00:00:14.614 --> 00:00:16.383 align:start size:84% position:16%
- How did you get here
into this country?

00:00:16.383 --> 00:00:18.218
- No more dreamers.

00:00:18.218 --> 00:00:19.652
No more dreamers.

00:00:19.652 --> 00:00:21.755 align:start size:84% position:16%
Mike I'm so tired
this is so exhausting.

00:00:21.755 --> 00:00:23.523 align:start size:81% position:19%
- We've walked
probably 80 steps.

00:00:23.523 --> 00:00:25.592
- When are we gonna
get a Cinnabon Mike?

00:00:25.592 --> 00:00:27.694
- At the end you have
to do a full workout

00:00:27.694 --> 00:00:29.229
to get your treat.

00:00:29.229 --> 00:00:30.063
- Whoa!

00:00:30.063 --> 00:00:31.197
(ominous music)

00:00:31.197 --> 00:00:33.233
Who's that big red fat guy?

00:00:33.233 --> 00:00:34.434
- Well that's Santa Claus sir.

00:00:34.434 --> 00:00:35.702 align:start size:88% position:13%
- How come he's getting
all the attention.

00:00:35.702 --> 00:00:36.669
- Because kids love Santa Claus.

00:00:36.669 --> 00:00:38.271
- I'm the only big fat red guy

00:00:38.271 --> 00:00:39.973
that gets attention around here.

00:00:39.973 --> 00:00:41.608
Paul, take him out.

00:00:41.608 --> 00:00:43.009
Take the shot Paul.

00:00:43.009 --> 00:00:43.977
Take the shot Paul.

00:00:43.977 --> 00:00:44.911
- Don't do it.

00:00:44.911 --> 00:00:46.146
- Come on Mike let's go.

00:00:46.146 --> 00:00:47.414 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Alright sir, we're
just gonna take

00:00:47.414 --> 00:00:48.948
a quick little break everyone.

00:00:48.948 --> 00:00:50.650
- You you're out of here.

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:53.186
Santa get him out, get him out.

00:00:53.186 --> 00:00:56.956 align:start size:84% position:16%
- [Mike] Santa's
gonna be right back.

00:00:56.956 --> 00:00:59.292
- You listen to me
fat man, I'm the one

00:00:59.292 --> 00:01:00.493
everyone's supposed to like

00:01:00.493 --> 00:01:03.563
and you're not gonna
take that away from me.

00:01:03.563 --> 00:01:04.431
- Should we go or?

00:01:04.431 --> 00:01:05.799
- Shut up Mike.

00:01:05.799 --> 00:01:07.267
You're gonna get naked.

00:01:07.267 --> 00:01:08.735 align:start size:94% position:6%
- I think it probably
would be best if we just,

00:01:08.735 --> 00:01:10.970
- Send him to Guantanamo?

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:12.105
Yeah take him.

00:01:12.105 --> 00:01:13.206
- Just give him what he wants.

00:01:13.206 --> 00:01:14.607
- Take him.

00:01:14.607 --> 00:01:16.076 align:start size:94% position:6%
- Alright alright
alright, I'll take it off.

00:01:16.076 --> 00:01:18.411 align:start size:97% position:3%
- Take it off, nice and slow
so I can see everything.

00:01:18.411 --> 00:01:19.879
- No you don't, that doesn't,
that's not part of it thought.

00:01:19.879 --> 00:01:20.713
The slow part,

00:01:20.713 --> 00:01:21.881
- It is for me Mike,

00:01:21.881 --> 00:01:22.982
it is for me.

00:01:24.584 --> 00:01:27.020
(playful music)

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:31.191
You guys the real Santa's
here, the real Santa right?

00:01:32.459 --> 00:01:35.228
Okay little one come on up.

00:01:35.228 --> 00:01:37.530
Whoa whoa whoa,
where's the seat.

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:38.765
- [Mike] Sir, sorry sir.

00:01:38.765 --> 00:01:40.900
Just for sanitary
purposes, go ahead.

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:41.734
- [Trump] There we go.

00:01:41.734 --> 00:01:43.303
- [Mike] There you go.

00:01:43.303 --> 00:01:46.506
- Now what's your mother want
to get, hi honey how are you?

00:01:46.506 --> 00:01:47.540
Do you have a father?

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:48.741
- Yes.

00:01:48.741 --> 00:01:50.410 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Is he still
married to your mom?

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:51.311
- Yeah.

00:01:51.311 --> 00:01:53.613
- Great, forget it.

00:01:53.613 --> 00:01:55.849 align:start size:94% position:6%
What do you think of Mitch
McConnell, jerk right?

00:01:55.849 --> 00:01:57.350
- Who is that?

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:59.786
- Exactly, nobody knows,
'cause he's a total nobody.

00:01:59.786 --> 00:02:02.188 align:start size:97% position:3%
You know what Mitch McConnell
wants for Christmas?

00:02:02.188 --> 00:02:03.690
A chin, right?

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:04.924
Am I right?

00:02:04.924 --> 00:02:07.961
What do you think
of Donald Trump?

00:02:07.961 --> 00:02:09.629
- I think he's mean.

00:02:10.797 --> 00:02:11.865
- Mike shut up.

00:02:11.865 --> 00:02:13.399
- I'm not saying a word.

00:02:13.399 --> 00:02:15.335
That's exactly right.

00:02:15.335 --> 00:02:17.437
- Do you like Donald Trump?

00:02:17.437 --> 00:02:22.041 align:start size:94% position:6%
- He always lies and he
always says, you're fired.

00:02:22.041 --> 00:02:23.943 align:start size:84% position:16%
- That's right, he
does say you're fired.

00:02:23.943 --> 00:02:24.878
- He tells the truth.

00:02:24.878 --> 00:02:26.012
- He always tells the truth.

00:02:26.012 --> 00:02:27.280
- All the time.

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:29.516 line:0%
- No, he always tells lies.

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:32.886
- Whoa, what am I on trial?

00:02:32.886 --> 00:02:34.087 align:start size:72% position:28%
- Yes.
- Not yet sir.

00:02:34.087 --> 00:02:35.555
- Ow.

00:02:35.555 --> 00:02:36.422
(laughs)

00:02:36.422 --> 00:02:38.758
ow, get her out of here.

00:02:38.758 --> 00:02:39.726
- Him too.

00:02:39.726 --> 00:02:40.760
- Ow, ow.

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:41.594
Ow.

00:02:42.529 --> 00:02:43.663
This whole thing is dumb.

00:02:43.663 --> 00:02:45.265 align:start size:88% position:13%
And the presents
aren't even real, okay?

00:02:45.265 --> 00:02:47.967
And these kids believe it's
some mythological character

00:02:47.967 --> 00:02:49.536
that doesn't even exist.

00:02:49.536 --> 00:02:50.737
- I think they can hear you.

00:02:50.737 --> 00:02:52.705 align:start size:88% position:13%
- Who cares Mike, let's
face it, I'm done.

00:02:52.705 --> 00:02:54.974
Paul, Paul, come on.

00:02:54.974 --> 00:02:56.476
There we go, whoa.

00:02:59.546 --> 00:03:03.783
- I guess I can always
step in and take over.

00:03:03.783 --> 00:03:04.617
Okay,

00:03:05.652 --> 00:03:07.520
(Christmas music)

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:08.521
- Damn kids.

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:13.092 align:start size:88% position:13%
I mean what do those
kids know about respect,

00:03:13.092 --> 00:03:16.062 align:start size:97% position:3%
I'm the President of the
United States and Santa Claus.

00:03:16.062 --> 00:03:17.964
They don't respect anything.

00:03:17.964 --> 00:03:18.965
There we go.

00:03:19.832 --> 00:03:22.769
(slurps and chews)

00:03:25.772 --> 00:03:29.676
- Do you remember the
reason for the season?

00:03:29.676 --> 00:03:32.979 align:start size:88% position:13%
The birth of our Lord
and savior Jesus Christ.

00:03:32.979 --> 00:03:36.382
Let me quote you from
the book of Isaiah.

00:03:43.957 --> 00:03:45.625
- I don't need them.

00:03:47.827 --> 00:03:48.995
Wait a minute,

00:03:50.396 --> 00:03:52.932
by George I think I've got it.

00:03:52.932 --> 00:03:56.402
Enough, we're not doing this
stupid Santa thing anymore,

00:03:56.402 --> 00:03:59.372 align:start size:97% position:3%
we're doing an old fashioned
rally, you understand me?

00:03:59.372 --> 00:04:00.273
Get this out of the way.

00:04:00.273 --> 00:04:01.507
- Oh really perfect.

00:04:01.507 --> 00:04:03.443
Children, children,
gather round here,

00:04:03.443 --> 00:04:06.546 align:start size:97% position:3%
come down to the front
here, wonderful, very good.

00:04:06.546 --> 00:04:11.084 align:start size:97% position:3%
Ladies and gentlemen the Santa
Claus of the United States

00:04:11.084 --> 00:04:12.018
of America.

00:04:13.319 --> 00:04:15.221
Yay, wonderful.

00:04:15.221 --> 00:04:16.656
(scattered applause)

00:04:16.656 --> 00:04:18.958 align:start size:97% position:3%
- There are millions of
children who couldn't even get

00:04:18.958 --> 00:04:22.028 align:start size:84% position:16%
into this rally,
it's so unbelievable

00:04:23.162 --> 00:04:24.864 align:start size:84% position:16%
and let me tell
you something kids.

00:04:24.864 --> 00:04:26.699 align:start size:84% position:16%
We don't need homework
anymore anybody,

00:04:26.699 --> 00:04:29.235
we're gonna get rid
of the teachers.

00:04:29.235 --> 00:04:30.169
(kids cheer)

00:04:30.169 --> 00:04:33.106
It's time to drain the swamp.

00:04:33.106 --> 00:04:35.008 align:start size:88% position:13%
- [Kids] Drain the
swamp, drain the swamp.

00:04:35.008 --> 00:04:36.809
- [Trump] I love it.

00:04:36.809 --> 00:04:38.378
- [Kids] Drain the swamp.

00:04:38.378 --> 00:04:39.479
- [Trump] There you go.

00:04:39.479 --> 00:04:41.381
- [kids] Drain the swamp.

00:04:41.381 --> 00:04:42.715
Drain the swamp.

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:47.720 align:start size:88% position:13%
- And I can promise
that all of your mothers

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:51.190 align:start size:84% position:16%
will get you literally
everything on your
Christmas list

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:53.693
or they're going to jail.

00:04:53.693 --> 00:04:55.528 align:start size:84% position:16%
Lock her up.
- [Kids] Lock her up.

00:04:55.528 --> 00:04:57.163
Lock her up.

00:04:57.163 --> 00:04:58.164
Lock her up.

00:04:59.766 --> 00:05:01.367
- [Trump] Beautiful.

00:05:06.139 --> 00:05:08.875
Get him out, get
him out of here.

00:05:09.942 --> 00:05:11.110
Get him out yeah.

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:13.012
Get him out of here.

00:05:13.012 --> 00:05:16.349
It turns out mall Santa's
and I are a lot alike.

00:05:16.349 --> 00:05:20.586 align:start size:97% position:3%
We both promise gifts we never
actually plan to deliver.

00:05:20.586 --> 00:05:25.191 align:start size:94% position:6%
But for some reason people
keep believing in us.

00:05:25.191 --> 00:05:28.361
(cheers and applause)
