00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:15.309
A quick online search of Aspartame will provide
you with numerous opinions about this artificial

00:00:15.309 --> 00:00:16.309
sweetener.

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:21.720
Some claim it causes things like cancer, seizures,
multiple sclerosis, lupus, memory problems

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:23.580
and brain tumors.

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:28.770
Just about every governmental organization
in the world, regulating food products, have

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:30.850
deemed it safe for human consumption.

00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:36.480
(But, you know, just about every governing
body in the world still gets the “sodium

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:41.239
raises blood pressure” myth wrong, despite
overwhelming scientific evidence to the contrary,

00:00:41.239 --> 00:00:44.660
so let’s not take their word on the whole
Aspartame thing!)

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:49.590
In an attempt to provide some sanity to the
controversy, let’s take an in-depth look

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:56.010
at this sweet, supposed compound-of-death
and see if we can’t make sense of the madness.

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:59.870
Aspartame was first developed by G.D. Searle
and Co in 1965.

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:03.000
In 1974, it gained approval from the FDA as
a food additive.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.350
The benefit of using Aspartame over sugar
is the result of how sweet it is.

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:12.210
Sugar and Aspartame both produce about 4 calories
per gram.

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:16.630
Aspartame, however, is about 180 times sweeter
than sugar.

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:20.310
Thus, you need much less to get the same perception
of sweetness.

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:23.610
This is the reason it works so well as a low-calorie
sweetener.

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:28.850
Aspartame is made of the two amino acids,
phenylalanine and aspartic acid, and the alcohol,

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:29.850
methanol.

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:33.549
All of the health concerns regarding this
sweet supplement are a result of what those

00:01:33.549 --> 00:01:35.900
three things can do to the body.

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:40.810
The question then becomes, do the three parts
of Aspartame cause health problems?

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:47.330
The quick answer is yes, at high enough levels
they do, but please don’t stop reading here-

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:51.490
the quick answer isn’t the whole answer.

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:55.409
So if high doses of Aspartame are harmful,
why are they allowed in our food?

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:59.580
It turns out, low doses aren’t harmful and
we even need those amino acids to perform

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:02.310
certain functions within the body.

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:06.200
In fact, phenylalanine and aspartic acid are
either produced by our bodies from many other

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:09.789
foods, or are already found naturally in our
diets.

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:14.980
Methanol, more commonly known as wood-alcohol,
is definitely not needed by our bodies.

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:19.320
If you’re wondering why it’s allowed in
Aspartame, it’s because it’s already found

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:22.319
in many drinks like wine, whiskey and beer.

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:26.030
As you might guess from the fact that humans
have been ingesting these for ages, at low

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:29.890
levels, it seems methanol has no long term
consequences.

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:34.660
That said, anything we take into our bodies
in high enough doses can be harmful.

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:38.640
Arguably, the most basic of human needs is
water.

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:42.170
Even water in high doses can kill you, in
what is being called water-intoxication.

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:43.434
An effect that leads to inadequate amounts
of salt in your blood, called hyponatremia.

00:02:43.434 --> 00:02:44.434
While you may think this would never happen,
over the course of my career as a paramedic,

00:02:44.434 --> 00:02:45.434
I’ve actually been on calls and seen people
die as a result of drinking too much water.

00:02:45.434 --> 00:02:46.434
Exactly how this can take place and more specifically
what is going on in the body is a topic for

00:02:46.434 --> 00:02:47.434
another article, though, as this one’s already
really long!

00:02:47.434 --> 00:02:49.250
In the end, almost everything we take in needs
to fall within a certain range to be beneficial,

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:51.540
or at the least not overly harmful.

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:54.440
Some things even in miniscule doses can be
deadly.

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:58.630
For many others, it takes large doses to have
lasting negative effects.

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:01.360
The phrase, everything in moderation, comes
to mind here.

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:05.430
Since we already have Aspartame’s three
ingredients in many of the foods we eat, the

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:11.690
question of Aspartame’s safety is more appropriately:
are the levels found in Aspartame, and the

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:15.860
dose you may be ingesting, high enough to
cause unwanted health effects?

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:20.720
To answer that, I’ll need to go into a little
more depth on the aforementioned three things

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:21.940
that make up Aspartame.

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:27.890
Aspartic acid is one of the many amino acids
that help make the numerous proteins our bodies

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:28.890
use.

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:33.239
It helps the liver by aiding in the removal
of ammonia, and is involved in the production

00:03:33.239 --> 00:03:36.340
of anti-bodies created by the immune system.

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:42.330
It can be found in many different types of
foods like asparagus, avocado’s, sugar beets,

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:44.310
sausages, and molasses.

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:49.630
Too much aspartic acid can be seen in several
different disease processes like: Lou Gehrig’s

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:52.239
disease, Epilepsy, and certain strokes.

00:03:52.239 --> 00:03:58.409
Unfortunately for those fighting against Aspartame,
the levels seen in these conditions are several

00:03:58.409 --> 00:04:03.720
fold higher than can be achieved by eating
Aspartame at recommended amounts.

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:10.080
There has also never been a direct cause and
effect shown between these diseases and increased

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:11.200
aspartic acid intake.

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:15.750
Methanol, in general, does result in some
unwanted reactions within the body.

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:20.629
Specifically, it’s taken up by the cells
of the body and the production of formaldehyde

00:04:20.629 --> 00:04:23.479
and formic acid are the result.

00:04:23.479 --> 00:04:26.919
Formaldehyde at high levels will cause proteins
to form abnormally.

00:04:26.919 --> 00:04:30.089
The result is proteins that no longer function.

00:04:30.089 --> 00:04:34.969
Formic acid, at high levels, will cause abnormal
metabolic processes within cells, causing

00:04:34.969 --> 00:04:36.439
them to cease functioning.

00:04:36.439 --> 00:04:40.009
The result is death to that cell due to a
lack of energy.

00:04:40.009 --> 00:04:45.130
This is because it disrupts the organelle
responsible for a cells metabolism, known

00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:47.229
as your mitochondria.

00:04:47.229 --> 00:04:52.499
Some cells within the body are extremely sensitive
to formic acid, specifically the ones in the

00:04:52.499 --> 00:04:54.009
optic nerve.

00:04:54.009 --> 00:04:57.590
This is why blindness is associated with methanol
poisoning.

00:04:57.590 --> 00:05:01.599
So does Aspartame produce enough methanol
to harm people?

00:05:01.599 --> 00:05:02.599
Probably not.

00:05:02.599 --> 00:05:07.080
There are numerous other foods we eat every
day that have the same, or higher, amounts

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:08.599
of methanol than Aspartame.

00:05:08.599 --> 00:05:13.229
Beer and wine aside, foods like tomatoes (and
tomato juice), and citrus fruits and their

00:05:13.229 --> 00:05:16.110
associated juices are good examples here.

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:20.129
This brings us to the last ingredient of Aspartame,
phenylalanine.

00:05:20.129 --> 00:05:26.229
There is a rare disorder called Phenylketonuria
affecting about 1 in 10,000 people.

00:05:26.229 --> 00:05:30.279
This ailment leaves your body an inability
to break down phenylalanine.

00:05:30.279 --> 00:05:34.249
Left untreated, toxic levels of phenylalanine
build up.

00:05:34.249 --> 00:05:39.180
The results can be things like developmental
disorders, cardiac rhythm problems, seizures

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:40.949
and severe learning disabilities.

00:05:40.949 --> 00:05:45.800
Fortunately, most babies born in the developed
world are tested for this disorder and treatment

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:48.159
usually involves diet control.

00:05:48.159 --> 00:05:51.969
Diet control because there are many foods
that contain higher levels of phenylalanine

00:05:51.969 --> 00:05:53.089
than Aspartame.

00:05:53.089 --> 00:05:56.309
Specifically, the many different types of
proteins we take in.

00:05:56.309 --> 00:06:01.749
Knowing this disorder exists, the FDA requires
that Aspartame products be labeled specifically

00:06:01.749 --> 00:06:04.460
for phenylketonuria patients.

00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:09.300
Like any food additive evaluated by the FDA,
there is an extensive process that takes place

00:06:09.300 --> 00:06:12.379
before manufacturers are allowed to put it
in our foods.

00:06:12.379 --> 00:06:17.069
When the FDA first approved Aspartame as an
additive, there were numerous controversies

00:06:17.069 --> 00:06:18.550
surrounding its approval.

00:06:18.550 --> 00:06:23.569
Those controversies revolved around the studies
the FDA looked at, advocating Aspartame’s

00:06:23.569 --> 00:06:24.569
safety.

00:06:24.569 --> 00:06:27.909
That said, since its initial distribution
to the masses, there have been countless new

00:06:27.909 --> 00:06:31.080
studies performed looking at Aspartame’s
safety.

00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:35.330
Numerous other reviews of the research have
been conducted by several agencies, including

00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:38.650
the FDA and the European Food Safety Authority
(EFSA).

00:06:38.650 --> 00:06:44.149
The most recent was conducted by the EFSA
and issued on December 10, 2013.

00:06:44.149 --> 00:06:50.189
That review looked at almost all studies performed
on Aspartame, in animal and human alike.

00:06:50.189 --> 00:06:55.150
Knowing there is such a large controversy
surrounding the supplement, the EFSA’s independent

00:06:55.150 --> 00:07:01.990
panel of experts issued an open public call
for any data, comments, or concerns on Aspartame.

00:07:01.990 --> 00:07:07.139
According to Alicia Mortensen, chair of the
EFSA’s panel, “This opinion represents

00:07:07.139 --> 00:07:11.909
one of the most comprehensive risk assessments
of Aspartame ever undertaken.”

00:07:11.909 --> 00:07:17.499
The panel concluded that Aspartame does not
cause cancer at the levels consumed by humans,

00:07:17.499 --> 00:07:19.759
and it doesn’t cause problems during pregnancy.

00:07:19.759 --> 00:07:25.180
Overall, “There were no safety concerns
at the current ADI (acceptable daily intake)

00:07:25.180 --> 00:07:28.009
of 40 milligrams per kilogram of body weight.”

00:07:28.009 --> 00:07:32.970
For your reference, according to the American
Cancer Society (ACS), there are on average

00:07:32.970 --> 00:07:37.949
about 180 mg of aspartame in a typical 12
ounce can of diet soda.

00:07:37.949 --> 00:07:43.819
So an adult weighing 165 pounds would need
to drink about 16 cans of diet soda per day

00:07:43.819 --> 00:07:49.680
to exceed the recommended limit, which itself
is set drastically below dangerous thresholds.

00:07:49.680 --> 00:07:55.590
Specifically, according to the ACS, the acceptable
daily intake is set at “about 100 times

00:07:55.590 --> 00:08:00.889
less than the smallest amount that might cause
health concerns, based on studies done in

00:08:00.889 --> 00:08:02.389
lab animals.”

00:08:02.389 --> 00:08:07.719
Not that you’d be able to in reality, but
if you actually managed to drink 1,600 cans

00:08:07.719 --> 00:08:15.100
of diet soda in a day (one every 54 seconds),
you’ll have much bigger problems than aspartame

00:08:15.100 --> 00:08:16.100
intake.

00:08:16.100 --> 00:08:21.310
Even though the EFSA’s extremely comprehensive
review should have put this issue to rest,

00:08:21.310 --> 00:08:25.729
there are researchers who still think they
didn’t go far enough.

00:08:25.729 --> 00:08:31.180
Erik Millstone, a science and food policy
expert at the University of Sussex, UK, wrote

00:08:31.180 --> 00:08:35.000
an open letter to colleagues in response to
the EFSA’s review.

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:40.779
In it, he states the panel knowingly ignored
studies showing negative effects of Aspartame

00:08:40.779 --> 00:08:42.840
and deemed them unreliable.

00:08:42.840 --> 00:08:46.490
All while the studies showing no ill effects
were deemed reliable.

00:08:46.490 --> 00:08:49.180
The initial question then still remains.

00:08:49.180 --> 00:08:51.949
Does Aspartame have negative health effects?

00:08:51.949 --> 00:08:54.509
Some studies say it can and some say it can’t.

00:08:54.509 --> 00:08:59.280
However, every study I could find showing
negative effects did so at levels not normally

00:08:59.280 --> 00:09:00.839
consumed by any human.

00:09:00.839 --> 00:09:03.420
(They were also all animal studies.)

00:09:03.420 --> 00:09:06.720
Again, even water will kill you if you drink
too much of it.

00:09:06.720 --> 00:09:11.190
In response to the numerous animal studies
that did show an increase in health problems

00:09:11.190 --> 00:09:16.660
at high levels, Dr. David Hattan, acting director
of the Division of Health Effects Evaluation

00:09:16.660 --> 00:09:18.190
in the FDA, states:

00:09:18.190 --> 00:09:23.360
The legitimate attempts that have been made
to confirm and replicate allegations of adverse

00:09:23.360 --> 00:09:30.129
reactions from Aspartame ingestion have not
been successful and the USFDA continues to

00:09:30.129 --> 00:09:34.920
consider this to be among the most thoroughly
tested of food additives and this information

00:09:34.920 --> 00:09:38.329
continues to confirm the safety of Aspartame.

00:09:38.329 --> 00:09:43.209
In the end, at levels recommended by health
safety experts, Aspartame has never been shown

00:09:43.209 --> 00:09:46.120
to result in negative health effects.

00:09:46.120 --> 00:09:49.820
Should you want to get those unwanted health
problems, according to animal studies, just

00:09:49.820 --> 00:09:55.120
consume an unrealistic amount of diet soft
drinks on a daily basis for several years.

00:09:55.120 --> 00:09:59.139
Just remember, you would get the same problems
should you continually take in excessive amounts

00:09:59.139 --> 00:10:04.370
of things like beer, wines, red meats, tomatoes,
and sugar beets over those same few years.

00:10:04.370 --> 00:10:09.069
If you did, however, manage to drink this
much soda, whether you drank it with Aspartame

00:10:09.069 --> 00:10:13.980
or sugar, you’re in for an awful lot of
other health problems which will most likely

00:10:13.980 --> 00:10:48.740
kill you well before anything like cancer
from Aspartame.
