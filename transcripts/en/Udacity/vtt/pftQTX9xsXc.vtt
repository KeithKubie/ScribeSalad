00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:04.320
Alright! So I'll call it my festival dashboard. And then Save. Or Save and Run?

00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:08.850
&gt;&gt; Save and Run. Yeah! You can totally see how once we had a bunch of

00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:10.630
these it would be really awesome to see

00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:13.570
all the information about our festival at a glance.

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:16.802
&gt;&gt; Yeah, sure. So we want to go back to Reports and Modify.

00:00:16.802 --> 00:00:17.969
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:00:17.969 --> 00:00:20.085
&gt;&gt; 'Kay. This one? Total revenue?

00:00:20.085 --> 00:00:20.634
&gt;&gt; Yep.

00:00:20.634 --> 00:00:22.650
&gt;&gt; Since that's the data source for the dashboard.

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:25.440
&gt;&gt; Exactly. And so we want to click Customize

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:28.600
again to modify this report. And so at the

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:30.730
top where it says to Add Filters click Add.

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:34.420
&gt;&gt; okay. So festival, oh, new to, and

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:36.390
even new I want to filter on a festival.

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:40.330
&gt;&gt; So, you want to add, if you click the little arrow next to that. Yep.

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:40.960
&gt;&gt; Festival name?

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:44.471
&gt;&gt; Festival name. And then Cloudstock. Mm-hm.

00:00:44.471 --> 00:00:47.180
&gt;&gt; And that's not going to change this becasue all

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:48.860
of are attendees are already there, like that but.

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:50.515
&gt;&gt; Right! But if you would have associated

00:00:50.515 --> 00:00:51.603
anyone to Ruffle Blueser.

00:00:51.603 --> 00:00:51.965
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:00:51.965 --> 00:00:53.130
&gt;&gt; This would eliminate that.
