00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:03.870
Hey guys I am Grant Thompson The King of Random. Welcome back to King's court number two and today

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:06.660
I do have a joke for [you] this one's from my six-year-old son!

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:10.080
He says what do clouds wear under their clothes the answer of course?

00:00:10.719 --> 00:00:11.590
[Thunder] [wear]

00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:14.909
First of all I just want to thank all of you who are in the comments a couple of weeks ago

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:17.760
It was very very encouraging [for] me to hear your feedback

00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:22.919
99.9% of what I saw on there was really encouraging a really faith promoting and it really

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:27.269
Launched me into a new level with my channel and what I want to do and where things are going

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:29.969
I'm really excited to tell you about some of those things today now

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:33.660
I have been in the kitchen for the last three days making candy for you

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:38.369
I'm going to be at CVX live on Friday and Saturday the 25th and the 26th

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:42.689
And I've got chocolate Lego that. I've just put together for anyone who comes to see me

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:44.579
[they're] [100%] edible they stack together

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:45.969
And they're all different colors

00:00:45.969 --> 00:00:51.059
Not only that but I've got bowl fulls here of gummy candies that I'm in the process of making as well

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:56.549
So we're going to have gummy legos chocolate legos, and I've got no real agenda except just to hang out and talk to you

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:00.899
So come and see me this Friday and Saturday at CVX live now. Here's a quick [update] on

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:05.039
What's been happening the last couple weeks since we talked [last] because I haven't been sitting around doing nothing

00:01:05.229 --> 00:01:12.688
I've actually been working on scripts videos production so as of [today]. I actually have 17 videos that are produced and uploaded and

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:17.339
Scheduled to go out eight of those [are] project videos nine of those are quick clips

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:22.950
And I have another 11 videos that are in various stages of [production] right now. They're coming up, so that's 28 videos

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:29.369
That's enough content to last me till october right now and with that buffer my plan is to get a production team [to] come in

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:35.039
help me with my video editing so that I can produce even more and maybe jump to two times a week or three times a

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:40.349
Week if [possible] I don't want to over promise and under deliver, but that's what my hope and my ambition is right now

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:45.329
I just launched my own patreon page this morning. I put the link in the description so you can go check it out

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:49.499
This is how we're going to launch it to the next level and you're one of my team players for those of you who may?

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:55.139
Not be familiar with patreon. It's a site where you can donate to me as a creator so I can outsource some of the

00:01:55.719 --> 00:02:00.179
Labor-intensive things that I'm doing and focus more on the creative projects and videos to bring to you

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:03.869
It's basically a way for you to help me create more content for you

00:02:04.119 --> 00:02:08.339
So it's a win-win if I can find a small production company to take over my video production

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:13.229
That's going to free up about 70% of my time work on new projects to bring to you

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:16.960
And here's my promise to you with every dollar that gets donated to me through patreon

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:24.740
I will invest 100% of that back into you and that [queue] of 17 videos I have right [now] that are

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:25.230
Unlisted some of you are going to get to see all [of] those weeks

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:26.820
And even months before they go live

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:30.359
I've never asked for donations before because I haven't really felt right about it

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:33.240
But this is a way that I truly feel like we can make it a win-win situation

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:35.969
[you're] going to help me take the channel to a whole nother level

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:41.010
[and] I'm going to be able to give you content and rewards that I wouldn't be able to do otherwise and if you want to

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:43.829
Give, but you don't have any money to give that's okay. Don't feel bad

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:49.499
I still appreciate you, and I'm just glad that you're here supporting me [on] YouTube because everything helps bigger small all right

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:53.970
So I've got ten new frequently asked questions that I'm going to address in this video, but if you have more questions

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:55.500
Make sure you put them in the comments

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:59.760
I will see those I'll pick them out [and] I'll put them in future episodes [so] one of the questions

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:01.600
I get a lot is are you ever going to go on TV?

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:06.629
And the answer is probably not over the last three [years] I've actually had over 200

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:11.190
television production companies contact me about doing shows for discovery history

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:17.910
Spike and every other TV network out there, which sounds really attractive, but the thing is in television

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:21.749
Nobody really wants to pay you they expect you to work for free they want you work for exposure?

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:26.220
and I'm not in a position where I can just take two or three years off to do a couple seasons and

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:30.239
Just work for free to see what happens. I'm here with you. I'm making videos for you

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:33.479
I don't have time for TV. And if they're not going to pay [for] my time

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:37.889
It doesn't [really] seem practical the other unfortunate thing about TV is people aren't watching it as much

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:39.780
More people are shifting to the internet

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:44.369
So [I] feel like being here with you on the internet is probably one of the best places that I can be right now

00:03:44.739 --> 00:03:46.739
television almost seems a little bit counterproductive

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:49.739
Another question says why don't you do life hack [videos] anymore?

00:03:49.739 --> 00:03:55.109
And I know it can see that way and honestly I do have a lot of life hack videos already made and coming up that

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:56.940
You haven't seen yet, but this last year

00:03:56.940 --> 00:04:03.209
It's been [a] little thin because I've had some passion projects like the whole rocket building series and the styro-slicer' that I really needed to

00:04:03.209 --> 00:04:05.459
Get done, so I put on the blinders

00:04:05.459 --> 00:04:06.760
And I focused through that

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:11.699
But they're all finished now, and so we're moving into next phase, and you will see a lot more life hack videos coming up

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:16.919
Thank you what camera gear [and] what editing software. Do you use now surprisingly? I'm still using the same [camera]

00:04:16.919 --> 00:04:19.709
I started using from day one. It's a canon t4I

00:04:20.289 --> 00:04:27.689
DsLR camera and get off ebay for about $500 the editing soft where I use is called Adobe Premiere pro. It used to be about

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:33.869
$2,700 for the whole master suite, but now they've got a monthly option for [$50.00] where you can access everything on a

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:35.500
monthly

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:37.410
Basis, what was your favorite project?

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:41.070
That's a great question I get asked that all the time my favorite project is all of them

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:43.890
And I know that might sound a little bit cliche, but every project

00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:49.169
I learned something new every [project] that I've ever done has taught me something new and I feel like I've grown as a result of

00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:54.539
That and so every project to me is very meaningful. It's very purposeful. I guess contrary to some people's beliefs

00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:57.390
I don't know how to do all these [things] from the beginning. I have to figure them out

00:04:57.390 --> 00:05:01.020
so every project is a challenge for me and the video is kind of like a

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:07.469
completion of that challenge once I figured it out made a video that's kind of like the culmination of all my experience has gone into

00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:10.230
It so I love all my projects for different reasons, but of course

00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:16.799
I'm really proud of ones that go popular like the magic mud Lego gummies Ninja balls things that people can do at home

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:18.240
I love all those for me personally

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:25.830
I like the projects that push me like I like making Arc welders out of microwaves because that was different [out-Of-the-box] thinking

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:26.970
But there's a little bit of a line

00:05:26.970 --> 00:05:30.809
I have to draw there because not necessarily everything that interests me is appropriate for the internet

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:34.830
so I have to be really careful about how I present things because we're all in different levels of learning and

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:38.549
some people are above me and some people are below me and I'm just trying to present my

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:44.160
Experiences through my videos and my goal is to make every video a masterpiece [a] lot of people have wondered

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:47.369
why do you post a quick clip when you're going to use the same footage again in the

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:52.950
Tutorial and I probably am going to address this in a whole different video. I have 10 really good reasons

00:05:52.950 --> 00:05:59.039
Why I feel I should have quick clips, but the really short answer is basically because it allows me to post videos more regularly

00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:05.070
while still working on high quality videos if I only put out videos as I [finish] them every 10 days then YouTube's

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:10.109
algorithms are going to kind of kick my channel out and it's not going to benefit anybody by posting quick clips it gives you a

00:06:10.110 --> 00:06:12.090
Preview of what's coming up and at the same time?

00:06:12.090 --> 00:06:17.010
It helps fill the gap between my project videos, so it keeps my channel a little more regular another viewer asks

00:06:17.010 --> 00:06:20.339
Have you ever gotten or [heard] from one of the things you've made and the answer is yes?

00:06:20.340 --> 00:06:21.730
And it's this finger right here

00:06:21.730 --> 00:06:25.469
If you saw my video on making the ARc furnace you know at the very end of the video

00:06:25.470 --> 00:06:27.540
I had a copper khan solo in carbonite

00:06:27.730 --> 00:06:33.869
And when I was actually cutting the wax for that mold I had a kitchen knife and somehow. I'm not really sure how it happened

00:06:34.420 --> 00:06:37.509
that knife went straight into my finger and cut through the nerves and

00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:43.150
Almost took my finger right off actually it's been over a year now and I can bend it to there

00:06:43.150 --> 00:06:44.950
I still don't have full use of it

00:06:44.950 --> 00:06:48.610
And I've tried to hide it pretty well in my videos went about halfway through it severed the nerves

00:06:48.610 --> 00:06:53.199
[I] still don't have feeling in my fingertip, but I actually am pretty lucky with what I've cut here

00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:56.259
And it doesn't really hold me back that much I can still type

00:06:56.260 --> 00:07:01.569
I could still edit and I almost have full use of my finger. I just can't feel anything in the fingertip right now

00:07:01.570 --> 00:07:04.330
This is a question that popped up a couple times in my last video

00:07:04.330 --> 00:07:09.249
And it's really appropriate is why don't you get a patreon page and hire an editor so perfect [I] took your advice

00:07:09.490 --> 00:07:10.570
I got a patreon page

00:07:10.570 --> 00:07:14.170
and I'm in the process of interviewing quite a few different editors and

00:07:14.330 --> 00:07:18.490
hopefully one [of] them is going to stick and be able to take over producing top quality content and

00:07:18.740 --> 00:07:23.889
Allow me more free time. [are] you an engineer? [I] am not an engineer. I have no engineering qualifications whatsoever

00:07:24.410 --> 00:07:29.140
Everything that I do is I guess based on trial and error and then when I present things

00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:31.960
It's what's worked a lot of the things that [I] fail on you

00:07:31.960 --> 00:07:34.960
Don't see and I fail on a lot of things before I even film them

00:07:34.960 --> 00:07:40.239
I do my own projects five to ten times before I even turn on the camera so a lot of the bloopers and the fails

00:07:40.240 --> 00:07:42.639
You don't even see because I never even have the camera running

00:07:42.640 --> 00:07:44.540
It's not until I've got the project nearly

00:07:44.540 --> 00:07:50.080
Perfected that I turn on a camera and actually start filming it this is a good question how much do you spend on [your] projects?

00:07:50.080 --> 00:07:54.969
And the answer is a lot more than you think even when I'm doing a simple little project like what I've been prototyping this week

00:07:54.970 --> 00:07:57.460
Was just basically how to make a chocolate milkshake

00:07:57.460 --> 00:08:04.030
[I] spent over a [hundred] dollars in materials on ice cream and cocoa powder and sweetened condensed milk [a] lot of different things because I'm

00:08:04.310 --> 00:08:09.490
Experimenting, and I've done like 15 different experiments with different variations, and I haven't even turned the camera on yet

00:08:09.490 --> 00:08:14.650
And I'll probably blow through more money before I'm actually finished but my goal. Is that when I present the video to you

00:08:14.650 --> 00:08:18.939
It's tried tested and true and [that] means I can't just take anything that I hear at face value

00:08:18.940 --> 00:08:21.550
I need to experiment with it. You know I've got recipes

00:08:21.550 --> 00:08:24.460
I found online, but I've done 15 of my own experiments

00:08:24.460 --> 00:08:30.099
and I don't like any of the recipes that I found I'm trying to make my own [so] sometimes it's 100 200 sometimes it's

00:08:30.500 --> 00:08:32.830
$1,000 per project my mini Metal foundry

00:08:32.830 --> 00:08:35.350
I went through 10 prototypes, and you know if you add that up

00:08:35.350 --> 00:08:39.729
It's probably well over [$1,000] just to come up with a version most people can do at [home] for 20 bucks

00:08:39.729 --> 00:08:42.759
So I do actually spend a lot [of] money on my project hundreds of dollars

00:08:42.760 --> 00:08:46.660
But that all goes into the prototyping and finding ways to cut cost so that when I bring

00:08:46.920 --> 00:08:50.250
The video it can be done as cheaply and as quickly with as little materials as possible

00:08:50.380 --> 00:08:54.809
[and] the last question here where do you buy liquid nitrogen good question now for [me]?

00:08:54.810 --> 00:08:57.359
I actually have a liquid nitrogen generator in my basement

00:08:57.399 --> 00:09:02.129
[have] a good friend that helped me set that up, but before I had my own liquid nitrogen generator

00:09:02.130 --> 00:09:06.449
[I] went to air gas suppliers welding suppliers any industrial gas supplier

00:09:06.449 --> 00:09:10.229
That sells gas to like argon or helium is probably going to have nitrogen as well

00:09:10.389 --> 00:09:15.389
So just call them up ask them if they sell liquid nitrogen chances are you're going to have to be over 18 [or] 21

00:09:15.459 --> 00:09:20.009
they are going to charge you quite a bit of money for it and we're from five to ten dollars [a] litre and

00:09:20.139 --> 00:09:22.619
You're going to have to have your own stainless steel dewar

00:09:22.630 --> 00:09:28.079
Which can be up to four hundred dollars so if you got all those things by all means go get yourself some liquid nitrogen

00:09:28.079 --> 00:09:32.638
So that's pretty much it for questions this time as far as expectations go two weeks from now

00:09:32.639 --> 00:09:36.389
I'm going to get back to posting my videos on a regular schedule at least every week

00:09:36.389 --> 00:09:39.359
And they're not going to stop again after that this next two weeks

00:09:39.360 --> 00:09:44.159
I'm going to be looking for production crews and trying to put all the systems into place to making this super sustainable going forward

00:09:44.410 --> 00:09:49.709
[so] if you have any other ideas on how we can take this channel to the next level I'm talking about you and me let

00:09:49.709 --> 00:09:54.749
Me know in the comments below let me know if you've got some insight on how we can make this thing bigger than myself

00:09:55.260 --> 00:09:58.949
I know, I've just got to get myself out [of] the way, and I'm working on doing that right now

00:09:58.949 --> 00:10:02.309
And I appreciate your support come see me at CVX live Friday and Saturday

00:10:02.310 --> 00:10:04.320
I'd still like to meet you, and I've got some treats

00:10:04.390 --> 00:10:09.449
You know tons and tons of treats that I want to give away so at least come for those if not for me and come

00:10:09.449 --> 00:10:14.369
see me on Patreon any level of support that you [can] give me is going to allow me to give back to you and

00:10:14.470 --> 00:10:18.660
Again, I promise that all the money that comes to me on Patreon will not be going in my pocket

00:10:18.660 --> 00:10:23.250
But would turn around and go [right] [back] into the channel the content and giveaways [for] you

00:10:23.250 --> 00:10:24.660
This is really about you

00:10:24.660 --> 00:10:29.940
And I'm looking for ways [to] expand what I can give and so thank you in advance for your support [well]

00:10:29.940 --> 00:10:33.359
I'm all out of time so I need to wrap things up, but I will see you in the next project video
