In this exercise you'll finish adding a hand to the original robot. You'll see

00:00:03.737 --> 00:00:07.076
in the initial code I've created one grabber for the hand by using the create

00:00:07.076 --> 00:00:10.852
robot grabber function. It starts like this, with just this one piece of the

00:00:10.852 --> 00:00:14.012
hand. Your goal is to create a hand that has two grabbers that slide along the

00:00:14.012 --> 00:00:17.977
cylinder and rotate together. I've provided sliders for both of these controls.

00:00:17.978 --> 00:00:21.458
When you're done, the hand should look like this. The hand z control rotates it

00:00:21.458 --> 00:00:25.510
as a whole. The hand spread slider opens and closes the hand. Note that for this

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:28.864
exercise you'll have to modify both the fill scene method and the render method.
