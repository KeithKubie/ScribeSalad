00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:04.230
Simplify the expression
18x to the fourth minus 3x

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:09.005
squared plus 6x minus
4, all of that over 6x.

00:00:09.005 --> 00:00:10.880
So there's a couple ways
to think about them.

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:12.190
They're all really equivalent.

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:14.150
You can really just
view this up here

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:21.470
as being the exact same thing
as 18x to the fourth over 6x

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:24.090
plus negative 3x
squared over 6x,

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:28.970
or you could say minus
3x squared over 6x,

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:34.221
plus 6x over 6x,
minus 4 over 6x.

00:00:34.221 --> 00:00:36.220
Now, there's a couple of
ways to think about it.

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:39.020
One is I just kind of decomposed
this numerator up here.

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:41.180
If I just had a bunch
of stuff, a plus b

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:49.360
plus c over d, that's clearly
equal to a/d plus b/d plus c/d.

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:51.541
Or maybe not so clearly,
but hopefully that helps

00:00:51.541 --> 00:00:52.040
clarify it.

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:53.581
Another way to think
about it is kind

00:00:53.581 --> 00:00:57.210
of like you're
distributing the division.

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:59.840
If I divide a whole
expression by something,

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:02.460
that's equivalent to
dividing each of the terms

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:03.510
by that something.

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:06.660
The other way to
think about it is

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:09.270
that we're multiplying
this entire expression.

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:12.940
So this is the same
thing as 1 over 6x times

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:16.560
this entire thing, times
18x to the fourth minus

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:20.345
3x squared plus 6x minus 4.

00:01:20.345 --> 00:01:22.720
And so here, this would just
be the straight distributive

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:24.200
property to get to this.

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:26.000
Whatever seems to
make sense for you--

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:27.350
they're are all equivalent.

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:30.995
They're all logical, good things
to do to simplify this thing.

00:01:30.995 --> 00:01:32.620
Now, once you have
it here, now we just

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:36.310
have a bunch of monomials that
we're just dividing by 6x.

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:38.701
And here, we could just
use exponent properties.

00:01:38.701 --> 00:01:40.950
This first one over here,
we can take the coefficients

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:41.930
and divide them.

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:46.060
18 divided by 6 is 3.

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:49.530
And then you have x
to the fourth divided

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:52.007
by x to the-- well,
they don't tell us.

00:01:52.007 --> 00:01:53.840
But if it's just an x,
that's the same thing

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:55.310
as x to the first power.

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:58.630
So it's x to the fourth
divided by x to the first.

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:02.600
That's going to be x to
the 4 minus 1 power, or x

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:04.930
to the third power.

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:07.025
Then we have this
coefficient over here,

00:02:07.025 --> 00:02:08.030
or these coefficients.

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:10.630
We have negative 3 divided by 6.

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:12.500
So I'm going to
do this part next.

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:15.520
Negative 3 divided
by 6 is negative 1/2.

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:22.200
And then you have x
squared divided by x.

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:25.170
We already know that x is the
same thing as x to the first.

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:30.490
So that's going to be x to the 2
minus 1 power, which is just 1.

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:33.270
Or I could just leave
it as an x right there.

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:38.400
Then we have these
coefficients, 6 divided by 6.

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:40.087
Well, that's just 1.

00:02:40.087 --> 00:02:41.670
So I could just--
well, I'll write it.

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:42.920
I could write a 1 here.

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:45.540
And let me just write the 1
here, because we said 2 minus 1

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:46.040
is 1.

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:50.200
And then x divided by x is x to
the first over x to the first.

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:53.060
You could view it two ways--
anything divided by anything

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:54.210
is just 1.

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:58.610
Or you could view it as x to
the 1 divided by x to the 1

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:01.050
is going to be x
to the 1 minus 1,

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:04.050
which is x to the 0,
which is also equal to 1.

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:06.210
Either way, you knew how
to do this before you even

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:07.501
learned that exponent property.

00:03:07.501 --> 00:03:11.120
Because x divided by x
is 1, and then assuming

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:14.290
x does not equal to 0.

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:16.300
And we kind of have to
assume x doesn't equal 0

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:17.133
in this whole thing.

00:03:17.133 --> 00:03:19.250
Otherwise, we would
be dividing by 0.

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:22.080
And then finally,
we have 4 over 6x.

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:24.640
And there's a couple of
ways to think about it.

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:31.010
So the simplest way
is negative 4 over 6

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:33.970
is the same thing
as negative 2/3.

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:35.569
Just simplified that fraction.

00:03:35.569 --> 00:03:37.110
And we're multiplying
that times 1/x.

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:44.300
So we can view this 4 times 1/x.

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:45.970
Another way to think
about it is you

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:49.230
could have viewed this 4 as
being multiplied by x to the 0

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:52.610
power, and this being
x to the first power.

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:55.710
And then when you tried to
simplify it using your exponent

00:03:55.710 --> 00:03:59.240
properties, you would have--
well, that would be x to the 0

00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:02.772
minus 1 power, which is x
to the negative 1 power.

00:04:02.772 --> 00:04:04.730
So we could have written
an x to the negative 1

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:08.370
here, but x to the negative 1
is the exact same thing as 1

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:09.490
over x.

00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:11.950
And so let's just write our
answer completely simplified.

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:18.220
So it's going to be 3x to the
third minus 1/2 x plus 1--

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:22.960
because this thing
right here is just 1--

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:26.540
and then minus 2 times
1 in the numerator

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:30.220
over 3 times x in
the denominator.

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:31.192
And we are done.

00:04:31.192 --> 00:04:32.150
Or we could write this.

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:34.260
Depending on what you
consider more simplified,

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:35.760
this last term right
here could also

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:39.360
be written in minus 2/3
x to the negative 1.

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:41.160
But if you don't want
a negative exponent,

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:43.595
you could write it like that.
