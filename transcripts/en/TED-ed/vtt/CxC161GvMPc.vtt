00:00:07.694 --> 00:00:11.534
Imagine as a thought experiment
that you live in a small village

00:00:11.534 --> 00:00:15.102
and depend on 
the local fish pond for food.

00:00:15.102 --> 00:00:18.071
You share the pond 
with three other villagers.

00:00:18.071 --> 00:00:23.412
The pond starts off with a dozen fish,
and the fish reproduce.

00:00:23.412 --> 00:00:27.856
For every two fish, there will be 
one baby added each night.

00:00:27.856 --> 00:00:30.424
So, in order to maximize 
your supply of food,

00:00:30.424 --> 00:00:34.266
how many fish should you catch each day?

00:00:34.266 --> 00:00:36.596
Take a moment to think about it.

00:00:36.596 --> 00:00:39.847
Assume baby fish grow 
to full size immediately

00:00:39.847 --> 00:00:42.866
and that the pond begins at full capacity,

00:00:42.866 --> 00:00:46.726
and ignore factors 
like the sex of the fish you catch.

00:00:46.726 --> 00:00:50.756
The answer? One, and it's not just you.

00:00:50.756 --> 00:00:53.707
The best way to maximize 
every villager's food supply

00:00:53.707 --> 00:00:58.437
is for each fisherman to take 
just one fish each day.

00:00:58.437 --> 00:01:00.108
Here's how the math works.

00:01:00.108 --> 00:01:04.734
If each villager takes one fish,
there will be eight fish left over night.

00:01:04.734 --> 00:01:07.117
Each pair of fish produces one baby,

00:01:07.117 --> 00:01:12.187
and the next day, the pond 
will be fully restocked with twelve fish.

00:01:12.187 --> 00:01:17.499
If anyone takes more than one,
the number of reproductive pairs drops,

00:01:17.499 --> 00:01:22.408
and the population 
won't be able to bounce back.

00:01:22.408 --> 00:01:25.149
Eventually, the fish in the lake 
will be gone,

00:01:25.149 --> 00:01:28.699
leaving all four villagers to starve.

00:01:28.699 --> 00:01:31.859
This fish pond is just one example
of a classic problem

00:01:31.859 --> 00:01:34.937
called the tragedy of the commons.

00:01:34.937 --> 00:01:37.508
The phenomenon was first described 
in a pamphlet

00:01:37.508 --> 00:01:42.177
by economist 
William Forster Lloyd in 1833

00:01:42.177 --> 00:01:44.749
in a discussion of 
the overgrazing of cattle

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:47.788
on village common areas.

00:01:47.788 --> 00:01:52.628
More than 100 years later, ecologist
Garrett Hardin revived the concept

00:01:52.628 --> 00:01:55.358
to describe what happens 
when many individuals

00:01:55.358 --> 00:01:58.200
all share a limited resource,

00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:59.689
like grazing land,

00:01:59.689 --> 00:02:00.792
fishing areas,

00:02:00.792 --> 00:02:01.889
living space,

00:02:01.889 --> 00:02:03.940
even clean air.

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:08.039
Hardin argued that these situations
pit short-term self-interest

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:10.249
against the common good,

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:12.741
and they end badly for everyone,

00:02:12.741 --> 00:02:14.140
resulting in overgrazing,

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:15.179
overfishing,

00:02:15.179 --> 00:02:16.489
overpopulation,

00:02:16.489 --> 00:02:17.560
pollution,

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:20.760
and other social 
and environmental problems.

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:23.270
The key feature of 
a tragedy of the commons

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:28.600
is that it provides an opportunity for
an individual to benefit him or herself

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:33.872
while spreading out any negative effects 
across the larger population.

00:02:33.872 --> 00:02:37.107
To see what that means,
let's revisit our fish pond.

00:02:37.107 --> 00:02:39.691
Each individual fisherman is motivated

00:02:39.691 --> 00:02:42.952
to take as many fish 
as he can for himself.

00:02:42.952 --> 00:02:45.571
Meanwhile, any decline 
in fish reproduction

00:02:45.571 --> 00:02:48.762
is shared by the entire village.

00:02:48.762 --> 00:02:51.453
Anxious to avoid 
losing out to his neighbors,

00:02:51.453 --> 00:02:56.403
a fisherman will conclude that it's in his
best interest to take an extra fish,

00:02:56.403 --> 00:02:57.242
or two,

00:02:57.242 --> 00:02:58.643
or three.

00:02:58.643 --> 00:03:02.591
Unfortunately, this is the same conclusion
reached by the other fisherman,

00:03:02.591 --> 00:03:04.043
and that's the tragedy.

00:03:04.043 --> 00:03:10.419
Optimizing for the self in the short term
isn't optimal for anyone in the long term.

00:03:10.419 --> 00:03:13.303
That's a simplified example,
but the tragedy of the commons

00:03:13.303 --> 00:03:17.864
plays out in the more complex systems
of real life, too.

00:03:17.864 --> 00:03:22.783
The overuse of antibiotics has led to
short-term gains in livestock production

00:03:22.783 --> 00:03:25.023
and in treating common illnesses,

00:03:25.023 --> 00:03:30.003
but it's also resulted in the evolution
of antibiotic-resistant bacteria,

00:03:30.003 --> 00:03:32.843
which threaten the entire population.

00:03:32.843 --> 00:03:36.466
A coal-fired power plant produces
cheap electricity for its customers

00:03:36.466 --> 00:03:38.563
and profits for its owners.

00:03:38.563 --> 00:03:41.225
These local benefits are helpful
in the short term,

00:03:41.225 --> 00:03:46.985
but pollution from mining and burning coal
is spread across the entire atmosphere

00:03:46.985 --> 00:03:49.968
and sticks around for thousands of years.

00:03:49.968 --> 00:03:52.108
There are other examples, too.

00:03:52.108 --> 00:03:53.024
Littering,

00:03:53.024 --> 00:03:54.188
water shortages,

00:03:54.188 --> 00:03:55.495
deforestation,

00:03:55.495 --> 00:03:56.728
traffic jams,

00:03:56.728 --> 00:03:59.541
even the purchase of bottled water.

00:03:59.541 --> 00:04:05.295
But human civilization has proven it's
capable of doing something remarkable.

00:04:05.295 --> 00:04:06.785
We form social contracts,

00:04:06.785 --> 00:04:08.595
we make communal agreements,

00:04:08.595 --> 00:04:10.146
we elect governments,

00:04:10.146 --> 00:04:11.995
and we pass laws.

00:04:11.995 --> 00:04:17.616
All this to save our collective selves
from our own individual impulses.

00:04:17.616 --> 00:04:22.186
It isn't easy, and we certainly 
don't get it right nearly all of the time.

00:04:22.186 --> 00:04:26.995
But humans at our best have shown
that we can solve these problems

00:04:26.995 --> 00:04:31.337
and we can continue to do so
if we remember Hardin's lesson.

00:04:31.337 --> 00:04:33.866
When the tragedy of the commons applies,

00:04:33.866 --> 00:04:37.266
what's good for all of us 
is good for each of us.
