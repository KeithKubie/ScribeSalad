00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:04.029
Space is a very old and dusty place.

00:00:04.029 --> 00:00:10.910
And that’s because our solar system began
as a big dust cloud billions of years ago.

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:16.740
Gravity eventually pulled all these dust particles
together to create comets and planets.

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:18.950
But gravity didn’t clean everything up.

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:24.710
There’s still a lot of cosmic dust floating
out there, residing in the space between stars.

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:29.820
And, some of it is probably right next to
you.

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:35.410
Cosmic dust are specs of material, about 0.01
millimeters in size.

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:38.390
But good things come in small packages.

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:44.900
These microscopic bits are made up of carbon,
iron, oxygen, silicon, and magnesium.

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:46.720
Those elements sound familiar right?

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:53.620
They’re the raw materials that the planets
in our solar system are made of, and us humans.

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:59.190
There's so much of it swirling around, that
nearly 60 tons of the stuff fall on Earth

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:01.830
every single day.

00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:08.610
But to enter the Earth’s atmosphere, the
little dusties use bubbles as parachutes,

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:11.060
preventing them from burning up upon entry.

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:17.650
We can find bits of cosmic dust everywhere,
on city rooftops, in Antarctica, and on the

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:19.070
cliffs of dover.

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:25.830
And these extraterrestrial particles can tell
us a lot about the history of our solar system.

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:43.000
So here on earth, you’re probably no more
than a few feet away from a piece of space.
