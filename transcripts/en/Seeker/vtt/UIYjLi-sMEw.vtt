00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:04.270
The old proverb goes "Incest is best, so put
your brother to the test".

00:00:04.270 --> 00:00:07.740
Today we'll examine the validity of this statement.....for
science......Do we have a barf bag off set

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:10.200
just in case?

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:16.490
Hey everyone, Laci Green here.

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:18.160
It's everyone's favorite subject: incest!

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:19.160
No really.

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:22.570
It seriously feels like incest is now everyone's
favorite topic.

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:26.910
It's a big Japanese porn thing, it's a big
Game of Thrones thing....a big yahoo answers

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:27.910
thing.

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:29.180
Oh, humans.

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:31.980
Incest is a moral dilemma as well as a scientific
one.

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:36.100
Few things provoke such disgust---for MOST
people---as the idea of having sex with a

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:37.100
blood relative.

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:40.760
Of course non-consensual sexual contact with
a family member is a form of abuse and absolutely

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:44.440
not OK, but what about when it's consensual
and they're not having kids?

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:48.690
It's hard for a rational person to reason
out of, and yet that disgust is still goin

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:49.690
strong.

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:54.039
But, this is science time, because YAY DNEWS,
so let's talk about incest or inbreeding from

00:00:54.039 --> 00:00:55.160
a scientific standpoint.

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:59.280
A recent report in the open access journal
PeerJ found that inbreeding in woolly mammoths

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.390
from the North Sea may be why they went extinct.

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:05.030
The researcher's main clue was cervical ribs
on the neck of the fossils.

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:08.950
These ribs are known to develop when genetic
or environmental disturbances take place while

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:10.119
the embryo is developing.

00:01:10.119 --> 00:01:13.459
There are also other birth defects that are
associated with this mutation and the scientists

00:01:13.459 --> 00:01:17.829
believe those abnormalities could have played
a role in the mammoth's ability to survive.

00:01:17.829 --> 00:01:22.749
Now, mammoths aren't the only species speculated
to have inbred - in fact most species will

00:01:22.749 --> 00:01:24.929
inbreed if it's the only option.

00:01:24.929 --> 00:01:28.039
Other animals known to inbreed often are...house
cats.

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:32.829
Bonobos practice incest as part of social
bonding, and in some species of wasp, over

00:01:32.829 --> 00:01:35.639
90% of them mate with their brother or sister.

00:01:35.639 --> 00:01:39.329
It's a strange paradox given the hell that
inbreeding can wreck on the offspring.

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:42.189
Inbreeding basically means that there's no
diversity of the genetic pool.

00:01:42.189 --> 00:01:44.079
So, bad genes are magnified.

00:01:44.079 --> 00:01:45.079
With...ummm...outbreeding?

00:01:45.079 --> 00:01:47.529
Is that a word?

00:01:47.529 --> 00:01:51.289
Basically how it goes down is that when humans
breed with non-relatives, the offspring gets

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:56.139
2 copies of a particular gene, so if one copy
isn't good, they have a normal one as backup.

00:01:56.139 --> 00:02:00.529
Inbreeding, particularly over many generations,
completely eliminates these backups across

00:02:00.529 --> 00:02:06.169
hundreds or thousands of genes, which can
cause some weird mutations and exaggerations

00:02:06.169 --> 00:02:07.169
of genetic defects.

00:02:07.169 --> 00:02:09.810
It will also cause fertility issues eventually.

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:13.409
Even though there are several species, including
humans, that practice incest and inbreeding,

00:02:13.409 --> 00:02:17.900
the majority of the animal kingdom rejects
incestuous advances in normal circumstances.

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:22.000
It's thought that different species have evolved
different mechanisms to make sure they don't

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:23.099
put their genes at risk.

00:02:23.099 --> 00:02:26.860
For humans, that mechanism may be a combination
of psychological systems -- including the

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:29.050
scent of their pheromones and facial detection.

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:34.069
I know incest is kinda gross, but when you
think about that disgust as a possible evolutionary

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:36.120
response...it's actually kinda interesting.

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:39.980
Let me know what you think down below and
I'll catch you next time with more DNews updates.
