00:00:02.320 --> 00:00:19.260
I can't think with all the background noise.

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:20.740
Ah, White noise.

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:21.940
Hey everyone!

00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:25.519
Amy with you on DNews today.

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:28.859
* To understand how white noise helps you
sleep, we need to take a quick step back and

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:31.749
look at how sound and hearing work first.

00:00:31.749 --> 00:00:35.390
Sound is a wave that moves through the air,
vibrating molecules as it goes along.

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:38.989
The vibrations hit the eardrums then pass
through to the inner ear where cells called

00:00:38.989 --> 00:00:42.149
hair cells change the vibrations into electrical
signals.

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:45.070
These signals go to the brain and tell you
what sound you’re hearing.

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:48.920
The frequency of that wave — technically
speaking, how often the particles’ vibrations

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:51.859
repeat in one second — is measured in hertz.

00:00:51.859 --> 00:00:56.120
Humans can hear sounds from 20 hertz to 20,000
hertz, and the higher the frequency the higher

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:59.719
the note you hear, and also the less easy
it is to ignore.

00:00:59.719 --> 00:01:03.539
And these hearing faculties still work when
you’re sleeping; even if you’re not awake,

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:06.000
your brain can register significant sounds.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.890
So when you hear noise at night and it wakes
you up, it’s the sudden change in frequency

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:12.860
of background noise that disturbs your sleeping
brain.

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:16.619
So how can you stop those sudden frequency
sounds from ripping you out of dreamland?

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:18.330
We’re back to white noise.

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:22.390
White noise, properly speaking, is a constant
noise that covers all hearable frequencies

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:25.120
at once at a constant power rate per hertz.

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:30.010
It’s frequency spectrum is completely flat,
so no new sounds can be heard over it… if

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:32.020
it’s playing loud enough, of course.

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:34.710
White noise essentially masks all other sounds.

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:36.390
And that’s where it gets its name.

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:40.280
White noise is analogous to white light: white
light is all wavelengths of light and white

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:42.290
noise is all frequencies of sound.

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:46.540
So because it’s characterized as constant
noise with equal power across all frequencies,

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:49.530
that means some sounds that people call white
noise aren’t.

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:52.950
The hum of an engine, for example, or the
pitter patter of rainfall.

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:57.350
They’re soothing sounds that block out some
noise, but they aren’t true white noise.

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:59.850
But white isn’t the only colour of sound.

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:03.630
There are others, and like how coloured light
is a specific wavelength, colours of noise

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:05.780
focus on specific frequencies.

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:09.250
And some research suggests that pink noise
is actually a better sleep sound than white

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:10.250
noise.

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:14.190
Like white noise, pink noise contains all
frequencies audible to humans ears, but the

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:17.170
power per hertz decreases as the frequency
increases.

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:19.300
It’s a subtle difference.

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:22.910
So here’s what white noise sounds like:

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:26.180
And here’s what pink noise sounds like:

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:31.160
And when you play them back to back, you can
hear the difference:

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:35.770
In a small study of 11 subjects, a team of
German researchers played pink noise in synchronicity

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:37.940
with sleeping subjects’ brain rhythms.

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:41.860
When compared to a control that had no sound
stimulation, the pink noise seemed to prolong

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:44.750
deep sleep and enhance memory retention in
the morning.

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:48.490
There are other colours of noise, too, corresponding
to different frequencies like how coloured

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:50.290
light focuses on different wavelengths.

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:55.190
There’s red or brown noise, blue noise,
violet, black, green, and orange noise, though

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:58.580
I didn’t find any research about how well
they help you sleep.

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:00.270
So why do we find white noise soothing?

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:02.660
Well, it’s a personal preference thing.

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:06.310
Some people love white noise and some hate
it, but most people find it helpful for sleep

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:09.310
because of it’s ability to mask other sounds.

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:12.270
And really, don’t we all want a nice, quiet
night’s sleep?

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:16.360
Sound is pretty neat, and because it’s a
physical wave it can do some weird things.

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:28.410
Trace talks about some of the amazing things
sounds waves can do in this video right here.

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:38.540
Do you guys love or hate sleeping with white
noise?
