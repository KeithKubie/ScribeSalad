00:00:01.367 --> 00:00:02.200
MORGAN FREEMAN
(VOICEOVER): Ian Ball had

00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:04.567
never been a religious person.

00:00:04.567 --> 00:00:07.200
He never really
thought about God.

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:09.467
But scarring from
brain surgery brought

00:00:09.467 --> 00:00:13.400
on a series of visions that
made him question everything.

00:00:16.633 --> 00:00:18.800
This carried on for
about three or four weeks.

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:19.934
About how often?

00:00:19.934 --> 00:00:21.266
- Every day.
- Every day?

00:00:21.266 --> 00:00:22.367
Every morning.

00:00:22.367 --> 00:00:24.367
I felt like I was being
sort of transported

00:00:24.367 --> 00:00:27.166
and being revealed
fundamental truths

00:00:27.166 --> 00:00:28.000
about the nature of reality.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.867
One of which is that all
inanimate objects are

00:00:33.867 --> 00:00:36.934
conscious, all beings
are conscious, including

00:00:36.934 --> 00:00:45.600
walls, tables, and
chairs, which seemed

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:46.967
very counterintuitive to me.

00:00:46.967 --> 00:00:52.533
I mean, how can you have
consciousness without a brain?

00:00:52.533 --> 00:00:54.100
The other thing that
seem to be happening

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:57.400
was that everything is
bound together in one thing

00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:00.367
by an endless
unconditional love.

00:01:04.633 --> 00:01:06.800
And there was this
huge wave of emotion

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:08.200
that came with this
experience, which was

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:10.433
really powerful and uplifting.

00:01:12.834 --> 00:01:14.367
MORGAN FREEMAN (VOICEOVER):
Are you religious?

00:01:14.367 --> 00:01:15.400
I was an agnostic.

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:17.100
I didn't know how
to understand it.

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:18.467
I don't know if it was God.

00:01:18.467 --> 00:01:19.667
You don't know that it wasn't.

00:01:19.667 --> 00:01:20.667
I don't know that it wasn't.

00:01:20.667 --> 00:01:21.633
I don't know what it was.

00:01:21.633 --> 00:01:22.333
Mhm.

00:01:27.834 --> 00:01:29.967
Ian wanted to find out
whether his visions

00:01:29.967 --> 00:01:31.767
had a medical cause.

00:01:31.767 --> 00:01:34.333
So he joined the
Cambridge University study

00:01:34.333 --> 00:01:37.467
conducted by Dr. Joseph Tenant.

00:01:37.467 --> 00:01:40.867
It was searching for a
connection between epilepsy

00:01:40.867 --> 00:01:43.500
and mystical experiences.

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:46.033
That's a scan of the
tumor that was the cause

00:01:46.033 --> 00:01:47.667
of the seizures I was having.

00:01:47.667 --> 00:01:49.200
So I mean, as you
can see on this scan,

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.633
the growth from the skull,
the left temporal lobe.

00:01:51.633 --> 00:01:53.600
And so this is pushing up
against Ian's the brain.

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:55.600
And so they had to cut
off that section away.

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:57.600
But obviously, when you do that,
you leave a bit of scarring

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:58.934
on the left temporal lobe.

00:01:58.934 --> 00:02:01.333
So it seems something
about the temporal lobe

00:02:01.333 --> 00:02:04.233
is potentially
capable of producing

00:02:04.233 --> 00:02:06.734
spiritual experiences.

00:02:06.734 --> 00:02:09.734
You have not come to any
sort of conclusions yet on it?

00:02:09.734 --> 00:02:12.967
We can't induce a seizure on
someone of a mystical nature

00:02:12.967 --> 00:02:16.033
and hope that we can get a
good scan of it under an MRI.

00:02:16.033 --> 00:02:17.967
We don't know when the
seizures are happening.

00:02:17.967 --> 00:02:22.667
Can't you come to some sort
of conclusion behind that?

00:02:22.667 --> 00:02:23.767
Not quite yet.

00:02:23.767 --> 00:02:24.567
I would.

00:02:24.567 --> 00:02:26.467
I would jump right to it.

00:02:26.467 --> 00:02:29.233
God exists.

00:02:29.233 --> 00:02:32.633
That's Joan of Arc,
Saint Bernadette.

00:02:32.633 --> 00:02:37.266
Do you think that
there is a possibility

00:02:37.266 --> 00:02:41.967
that they experienced
this sort of epilepsy?

00:02:41.967 --> 00:02:43.066
It is possible.

00:02:43.066 --> 00:02:44.934
So there was a
neurological paper

00:02:44.934 --> 00:02:47.867
that speculated that Paul's
vision on the road to Damascus

00:02:47.867 --> 00:02:49.100
was epilepsy.

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:50.500
But I mean, so what?

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:52.734
Because the thing that
occurred afterwards

00:02:52.734 --> 00:02:56.967
was Paul was moved to go
preach and become Saint Paul.

00:02:56.967 --> 00:02:58.100
Right.

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:00.700
As a scientist I can't
tell you whether these

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:02.333
are metaphysical or not.

00:03:02.333 --> 00:03:05.934
The thing we can look at is to
say that something in the brain

00:03:05.934 --> 00:03:08.633
is capable of producing
religious experience

00:03:08.633 --> 00:03:13.100
and can do so even when
it's not intending to.

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:14.367
All right.

00:03:14.367 --> 00:03:17.100
Here's the $64 question.

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:19.033
How has it changed you?

00:03:19.033 --> 00:03:21.767
Well, I think it
did remove any sense

00:03:21.767 --> 00:03:25.700
of that I had that the universe
is a meaningless, cold place.

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:28.900
I think it gave a kind of
foundation of meaning for me.

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:32.200
And I think the idea
of was it a revelation

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:35.166
or was it just an
aberration in the brain?

00:03:35.166 --> 00:03:36.900
I've come to the conclusion
it doesn't really matter,

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:40.066
because the thing that really
sticks with me is that feeling

00:03:40.066 --> 00:03:43.266
of endless unconditional love.

00:03:43.266 --> 00:03:44.667
And I don't think
that really matters

00:03:44.667 --> 00:03:49.100
whether it came from a divine
force or from my damaged brain.
