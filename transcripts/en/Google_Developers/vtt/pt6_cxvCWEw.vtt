Jordan:
Hi, I'm Timothy.

00:00:04.167 --> 00:00:09.367
This is
Scalable Structured Markup.

00:00:09.367 --> 00:00:12.033
Who here knows
what that means?

00:00:12.033 --> 00:00:13.901
A couple of you.

00:00:13.901 --> 00:00:15.534
All right, well,
I added another title,

00:00:15.534 --> 00:00:17.601
because I thought maybe I'd make
it a little bit more clear

00:00:17.601 --> 00:00:19.767
what this talk
is really about,

00:00:19.767 --> 00:00:23.868
and it's about putting
more knowledge into your site.

00:00:23.868 --> 00:00:25.167
I think that's
a really interesting idea,

00:00:25.167 --> 00:00:28.100
and over this,
the length of this talk,

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:30.400
we're going to look
at different ways to do that.

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:32.934
We'll see that putting
more knowledge into your site

00:00:32.934 --> 00:00:36.467
can be as simple
as just identifying the data

00:00:36.467 --> 00:00:40.067
that is already there
and not adding anything new,

00:00:40.067 --> 00:00:45.634
just be like,
"This is what it is."

00:00:45.634 --> 00:00:48.133
The richer the markup,
the more control you have

00:00:48.133 --> 00:00:49.901
over how your site appears

00:00:49.901 --> 00:00:53.234
and the more cool things
that can be done with that data.

00:00:53.234 --> 00:00:54.367
By the end of the session,

00:00:54.367 --> 00:00:55.901
you'll be able
to mark up your pages

00:00:55.901 --> 00:00:58.434
so that they can appear
in search engine results pages

00:00:58.434 --> 00:01:00.300
with Rich Snippets.

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.234
You'll be able
to test that markup,

00:01:02.234 --> 00:01:03.801
and you'll be able
to tell Google

00:01:03.801 --> 00:01:05.834
how often it should crawl
certain pages

00:01:05.834 --> 00:01:08.033
and when things change.

00:01:08.033 --> 00:01:10.667
This is all about getting
more control over your site,

00:01:10.667 --> 00:01:13.200
how your site appears
in search results,

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.667
and when it gets updated.

00:01:15.667 --> 00:01:17.067
And, of course,
at the end of the talk,

00:01:17.067 --> 00:01:18.400
I'll give
a better understanding

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:20.701
of maybe where
this is all going.

00:01:20.701 --> 00:01:23.767
Does that sound like fun?

00:01:23.767 --> 00:01:25.267
You all just had lunch,
didn't you?

00:01:25.267 --> 00:01:27.601
[laughter]

00:01:27.601 --> 00:01:31.067
All right, so here's some
interesting bits of information.

00:01:31.067 --> 00:01:32.234
Up there are the hashtags.

00:01:32.234 --> 00:01:33.567
If you would like to tweet
this session,

00:01:33.567 --> 00:01:34.868
I encourage you to do so.

00:01:34.868 --> 00:01:37.601
These are some hashtags
to identify your tweet.

00:01:37.601 --> 00:01:39.734
Also, there's a link
for feedback.

00:01:39.734 --> 00:01:42.934
I'd love to hear how you feel
about the session,

00:01:42.934 --> 00:01:45.567
and there's a link to where
the session is going to live

00:01:45.567 --> 00:01:48.767
after today.

00:01:48.767 --> 00:01:50.501
That's me.
Hello.

00:01:50.501 --> 00:01:52.701
I'm a Developer Advocate
at Google,

00:01:52.701 --> 00:01:55.634
and you can find me online,
and you can @mention me

00:01:55.634 --> 00:01:57.133
@timothyjordan.

00:01:57.133 --> 00:01:59.868
All right, so today this is what
we're going to talk about.

00:01:59.868 --> 00:02:01.434
We're going to look
at the past.

00:02:01.434 --> 00:02:02.901
Where does it all come from?

00:02:02.901 --> 00:02:04.367
We're going to look
at the present

00:02:04.367 --> 00:02:07.767
using Rich Snippets
and using Sitemaps,

00:02:07.767 --> 00:02:09.133
and we're going to look
at the future.

00:02:09.133 --> 00:02:12.501
What's next
for all of this markup?

00:02:14.234 --> 00:02:16.501
So, the past.

00:02:16.501 --> 00:02:17.968
This is how the Web looks,

00:02:17.968 --> 00:02:22.067
oh, I don't know,
circa 2000 or so.

00:02:22.067 --> 00:02:23.934
You edited some pages.

00:02:23.934 --> 00:02:26.234
You uploaded them
to your server,

00:02:26.234 --> 00:02:28.200
made a Website.

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:31.467
Google crawled those pages,
when it felt like it,

00:02:31.467 --> 00:02:34.501
and returned links
to your pages, as appropriate,

00:02:34.501 --> 00:02:39.067
on the search engine
results page.

00:02:39.067 --> 00:02:42.000
The problem was that
the Snippets on the results page

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:43.534
were relatively boring.

00:02:43.534 --> 00:02:45.567
I mean, they were
a good summary of the page,

00:02:45.567 --> 00:02:47.400
but they didn't share
the richness

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:50.100
of what those pages
actually had on them.

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:51.734
Every page
looked the same,

00:02:51.734 --> 00:02:55.033
and you had no control
over how it looked.

00:02:55.033 --> 00:02:57.767
So, the question was,
how could you get more control

00:02:57.767 --> 00:02:59.868
over the search engine
results page?

00:02:59.868 --> 00:03:02.100
How could you get it to know
more about your site,

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:05.767
and how could it provide
that knowledge to the user?

00:03:05.767 --> 00:03:11.167
That brings us to today,
the present.

00:03:11.167 --> 00:03:14.167
Your site probably looks
more like this, right?

00:03:14.167 --> 00:03:16.300
You've got a database
on the back end

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:19.167
that drives your pages.

00:03:19.167 --> 00:03:20.701
You can mark up those pages,

00:03:20.701 --> 00:03:24.968
identifying the data
that's already there.

00:03:24.968 --> 00:03:28.167
Google, when it crawls
those pages,

00:03:28.167 --> 00:03:32.100
can then see
what's on those pages,

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:34.067
what actually
those items are,

00:03:34.067 --> 00:03:37.934
and it can display those to
the user in an interesting way.

00:03:37.934 --> 00:03:39.834
Maybe that page
is a recipe page.

00:03:39.834 --> 00:03:41.567
It can show
a recipe Snippet.

00:03:41.567 --> 00:03:43.968
It can add ratings
where they exist.

00:03:43.968 --> 00:03:48.501
It's the richness of that data
that you get a say in now,

00:03:48.501 --> 00:03:51.100
and we can do some other
cool things with that data

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:54.801
that we'll look at
a little bit later.

00:03:54.801 --> 00:03:56.868
All right, so let's talk
about Rich Snippets.

00:03:56.868 --> 00:03:59.334
We'll dive into this topic.

00:03:59.334 --> 00:04:02.267
Rich Snippets have been around
for about two years.

00:04:02.267 --> 00:04:06.734
In fact, two years two days
from now.

00:04:06.734 --> 00:04:10.300
And over that time--you can see
I have a timeline,

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:13.267
because this is a presentation,
and you need a timeline.

00:04:13.267 --> 00:04:15.334
On my timeline, you can see
that over the last two years,

00:04:15.334 --> 00:04:17.000
we've been steadily introducing

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.734
different types
of Rich Snippets,

00:04:19.734 --> 00:04:21.767
and we've been introducing
different ways for you

00:04:21.767 --> 00:04:26.234
to mark up those Snippets that
we recognize and will crawl,

00:04:26.234 --> 00:04:31.167
from recipes to events
to prayer times last week.

00:04:33.701 --> 00:04:37.667
So, here's a couple examples.
This is a search for stuffing.

00:04:37.667 --> 00:04:40.234
And you can see
I'm looking for stuffing,

00:04:40.234 --> 00:04:41.901
and I get this response.

00:04:41.901 --> 00:04:44.501
This is on the whole page.
This is one of the responses.

00:04:44.501 --> 00:04:48.501
And you can see the richness
of the data in this Snippet.

00:04:48.501 --> 00:04:50.400
You've got a rating,

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:53.234
and we know how many reviews
that rating comes from.

00:04:53.234 --> 00:04:57.133
We've also got a clear
description there as well.

00:04:57.133 --> 00:05:00.367
So, when the user looks
and sees summary, summary,

00:05:00.367 --> 00:05:04.467
and then a Rich Snippet,
that really stands out to them.

00:05:04.467 --> 00:05:05.767
Here's another example.

00:05:05.767 --> 00:05:08.634
There's a search
for Drooling Dog Bar-B-Q.

00:05:08.634 --> 00:05:10.367
And, of course,
I got 26 reviews,

00:05:10.367 --> 00:05:12.601
and I also have
a price range,

00:05:12.601 --> 00:05:14.801
what you can expect to pay
at this restaurant,

00:05:14.801 --> 00:05:16.567
and I've got bread crumbs,

00:05:16.567 --> 00:05:20.601
which locate this page
in that site.

00:05:20.601 --> 00:05:24.000
We know that this is
a barbeque restaurant,

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.234
and we could
probably also navigate

00:05:26.234 --> 00:05:30.234
to other barbeque
restaurants.

00:05:30.234 --> 00:05:31.767
And in some cases,

00:05:31.767 --> 00:05:35.367
we can combine Rich Snippet data
with other data we find

00:05:35.367 --> 00:05:37.934
to further increase
the richness of the experience.

00:05:37.934 --> 00:05:40.000
And you see a really nice
description at the top,

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.000
and you'll also see
some other data that we found,

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:46.067
like an image and other places
where this is listed.

00:05:46.067 --> 00:05:47.400
So, those are Rich Snippets,

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:50.067
and you can see the value
of this to your user,

00:05:50.067 --> 00:05:51.667
and you can see
how that would translate

00:05:51.667 --> 00:05:58.200
into more traffic
and a better experience.

00:05:58.200 --> 00:05:59.734
All right,
so let's drill deep.

00:05:59.734 --> 00:06:02.434
Let's look
at some markup types.

00:06:02.434 --> 00:06:05.601
Now, with standards,
in general,

00:06:05.601 --> 00:06:08.334
there's always very strong
opinions about which is best.

00:06:08.334 --> 00:06:10.434
And I'm not going to tell you
which is best,

00:06:10.434 --> 00:06:11.968
but I'm going to give you
some pros and cons

00:06:11.968 --> 00:06:16.467
for three types that we read
and we'll scan for

00:06:16.467 --> 00:06:20.167
when we're looking for
structured markup on Web pages,

00:06:20.167 --> 00:06:22.467
the first of which comes
from RDA,

00:06:22.467 --> 00:06:24.834
and RDA has
a really great design.

00:06:24.834 --> 00:06:28.033
It comes from XML tradition,
and it's very general.

00:06:28.033 --> 00:06:30.467
You can express a lot of
different things with RDA--

00:06:30.467 --> 00:06:32.501
sorry, RDF.

00:06:32.501 --> 00:06:38.400
There's RDFa that does
an attribute-level mapping

00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:41.067
of RDF to XHTML.

00:06:41.067 --> 00:06:42.467
And that's cool.

00:06:42.467 --> 00:06:45.334
So you get all the power
and design of RDF.

00:06:45.334 --> 00:06:47.534
The problem, though,
is that sometimes this can be

00:06:47.534 --> 00:06:48.934
a little confusing to write,

00:06:48.934 --> 00:06:51.634
and, in fact, in user studies
with Webmasters,

00:06:51.634 --> 00:06:55.200
they found
the nesting structure of RDFa

00:06:55.200 --> 00:06:57.133
to be particularly confusing.

00:06:57.133 --> 00:06:59.901
That's when, say, you have
an entity such as an event,

00:06:59.901 --> 00:07:02.634
which includes an entity
such as a location

00:07:02.634 --> 00:07:05.367
that's nested
inside the event.

00:07:05.367 --> 00:07:09.434
That particular markup
can be a little confusing.

00:07:09.434 --> 00:07:11.567
Another option
is microformats,

00:07:11.567 --> 00:07:13.834
and this is just
a different place to start.

00:07:13.834 --> 00:07:15.667
Publishers generally
say this is easier

00:07:15.667 --> 00:07:18.801
to identify their data
in existing HTML docs

00:07:18.801 --> 00:07:23.901
using microformats, but
it's not as general as RDFa,

00:07:23.901 --> 00:07:26.601
so you can't express
as many things.

00:07:30.901 --> 00:07:34.934
And there's one more--
microdata.

00:07:34.934 --> 00:07:37.834
And microdata
has the general expression

00:07:37.834 --> 00:07:41.834
of entities like RDFa,

00:07:41.834 --> 00:07:44.234
but it also maps
more easily to HTML,

00:07:44.234 --> 00:07:45.901
and this is
my preferred method.

00:07:45.901 --> 00:07:50.267
I like it, mostly because when
I'm reading an HTML document,

00:07:50.267 --> 00:07:51.767
I can parse this easier,

00:07:51.767 --> 00:07:55.100
and so maybe that's just
a personal preference.

00:07:55.100 --> 00:07:58.634
This is the one that I'll be
using in examples today.

00:07:58.634 --> 00:08:03.067
Speaking of which,
let's take a look at an example.

00:08:03.067 --> 00:08:04.934
I want to give you
a URL first,

00:08:04.934 --> 00:08:07.734
and this is the Rich Snippet
testing tool.

00:08:07.734 --> 00:08:12.467
It's at
/webmasters/tools/richsnippets.

00:08:12.467 --> 00:08:13.534
It's a really cool tool.

00:08:13.534 --> 00:08:17.501
You can go there
and put in any URL,

00:08:17.501 --> 00:08:20.767
and it'll tell you
what data that it finds

00:08:20.767 --> 00:08:23.000
and gives you
an example Rich Snippet,

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:26.701
if it can find enough data
to construct one.

00:08:26.701 --> 00:08:30.601
Also, on the left of that page
is a link to our documentation,

00:08:30.601 --> 00:08:31.767
which will clearly list out

00:08:31.767 --> 00:08:35.734
all the different types
of structured markup

00:08:35.734 --> 00:08:38.400
that we'll look to and map
to a Rich Snippet,

00:08:38.400 --> 00:08:40.100
and what are
the different parameters

00:08:40.100 --> 00:08:42.534
that are required
and optional,

00:08:42.534 --> 00:08:46.434
and it also gives examples
for each.

00:08:46.434 --> 00:08:48.534
And, again, this is what
a Rich Snippet looks like.

00:08:48.534 --> 00:08:51.634
We're going to do an event.

00:08:51.634 --> 00:08:53.367
These are the properties
for the event.

00:08:53.367 --> 00:08:55.601
I'll come back to this table
several times,

00:08:55.601 --> 00:08:58.000
so don't worry about
copying it down real quick,

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:00.634
but you can see there's a number
of different properties,

00:09:00.634 --> 00:09:03.033
and they're all
pretty straightforward,

00:09:03.033 --> 00:09:08.467
from summary,
to URL, to location.

00:09:08.467 --> 00:09:12.834
This is a page
without markup,

00:09:12.834 --> 00:09:16.567
and it's as we would expect
a very simple HTML page to be.

00:09:16.567 --> 00:09:17.834
We've got some data,

00:09:17.834 --> 00:09:19.734
and we've got some very,
very basic formatting

00:09:19.734 --> 00:09:21.267
with line breaks.

00:09:21.267 --> 00:09:23.667
I'm going to take a look at
this page in the Snippet tool,

00:09:23.667 --> 00:09:29.300
just to get a default
baseline expectation.

00:09:29.300 --> 00:09:32.801
So, I've got
structured-markup.appspot.com.

00:09:32.801 --> 00:09:35.200
This is just a static
app engine site,

00:09:35.200 --> 00:09:37.200
so I've thrown some static files
onto app engine,

00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:43.701
so that you could play
with them, if you'd like.

00:09:43.701 --> 00:09:46.634
You want this URL.

00:09:46.634 --> 00:09:48.634
Oh, you want it bigger.

00:09:48.634 --> 00:09:50.834
How's that?

00:09:50.834 --> 00:09:52.834
Okay, thank you.

00:09:52.834 --> 00:09:56.834
The no-markup page
looks like this,

00:09:56.834 --> 00:09:58.367
and you can see
it's very basic.

00:09:58.367 --> 00:09:59.634
I just have some line breaks
in there.

00:09:59.634 --> 00:10:00.801
It's not pretty at all.

00:10:00.801 --> 00:10:02.434
I wanted to make sure
it was super basic

00:10:02.434 --> 00:10:06.868
so that we could see the markup
as it gets in there.

00:10:06.868 --> 00:10:09.567
I'm going to go ahead
and copy this URL and paste it

00:10:09.567 --> 00:10:13.868
into the Rich Snippets
testing tool,

00:10:13.868 --> 00:10:16.801
and you can see
there's insufficient data

00:10:16.801 --> 00:10:18.901
to generate the preview.

00:10:18.901 --> 00:10:20.734
That's what we'd expect, right?

00:10:20.734 --> 00:10:22.300
We don't expect it
to find anything,

00:10:22.300 --> 00:10:24.367
'cause, well, there's nothing
to find there.

00:10:24.367 --> 00:10:26.567
So, let's take a look at it
with some data.

00:10:26.567 --> 00:10:28.200
I'm going to add in
three bits of data--

00:10:28.200 --> 00:10:30.868
the two required types and
one of the recommended types.

00:10:30.868 --> 00:10:33.067
And I really strongly recommend
you add a location

00:10:33.067 --> 00:10:34.734
to your event as well.

00:10:34.734 --> 00:10:36.901
We've got a summary
up at the top.

00:10:36.901 --> 00:10:38.367
That's required.

00:10:38.367 --> 00:10:40.801
And we've got the start date
down there in the center,

00:10:40.801 --> 00:10:42.567
also required.

00:10:42.567 --> 00:10:44.000
And the location, of course,

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:46.000
is where this event
is taking place,

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:49.033
and that's going to be
a nested entity.

00:10:49.033 --> 00:10:50.767
Adding the markup,
it looks like this.

00:10:50.767 --> 00:10:53.667
And let me take you
through it line by line.

00:10:53.667 --> 00:10:56.501
At the top, we've got
an itemscope.

00:10:56.501 --> 00:10:59.734
That itemscope
is super important

00:10:59.734 --> 00:11:01.367
and really basic.

00:11:01.367 --> 00:11:03.367
If you have a div tag
or any tag

00:11:03.367 --> 00:11:07.067
that surrounds all the data
for that entity,

00:11:07.067 --> 00:11:09.501
that's where you put
the itemscope attribute,

00:11:09.501 --> 00:11:13.267
and it's going to tell readers
that everything inside,

00:11:13.267 --> 00:11:19.334
everything a child of that tag,
is the scope of this item.

00:11:19.334 --> 00:11:21.601
Does that make sense?

00:11:21.601 --> 00:11:26.267
Oh, good, there's nodding.
I like that.

00:11:26.267 --> 00:11:29.133
The next thing is
we've got an item type.

00:11:29.133 --> 00:11:30.634
We just got
to clearly indicate

00:11:30.634 --> 00:11:32.400
what kind of entity this is.

00:11:32.400 --> 00:11:36.167
In this case, it's an event.

00:11:36.167 --> 00:11:38.701
Now we've got item props.

00:11:38.701 --> 00:11:40.767
This is the item property.

00:11:40.767 --> 00:11:43.667
We've got three,
as I mentioned--

00:11:43.667 --> 00:11:47.434
summary, start date,
and location.

00:11:47.434 --> 00:11:49.868
And the data
contained in those tags

00:11:49.868 --> 00:11:53.934
corresponds to that parameter,
that property.

00:11:53.934 --> 00:11:56.234
Let's take a look at the nested
one down here at the bottom.

00:11:56.234 --> 00:12:00.000
You'll notice that I have,
next to the item prop location,

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:04.267
another itemscope
and item type.

00:12:04.267 --> 00:12:06.934
Since it's nested, we're going
to add another entity

00:12:06.934 --> 00:12:10.234
inside that parent entity,
so it'll need an itemscope

00:12:10.234 --> 00:12:12.467
and an item type
to indicate it.

00:12:12.467 --> 00:12:15.667
In this case, we're going
to list an organization

00:12:15.667 --> 00:12:19.834
as the location
of this event.

00:12:19.834 --> 00:12:21.667
And, of course,
it has an item prop.

00:12:21.667 --> 00:12:23.567
I've just added one--
the name.

00:12:23.567 --> 00:12:25.901
That's required.

00:12:25.901 --> 00:12:28.434
So, let's take a look
at this live.

00:12:28.434 --> 00:12:30.501
I like saying that.

00:12:30.501 --> 00:12:33.200
Over here, I'm going to
the required markup link,

00:12:33.200 --> 00:12:34.267
and it looks like this.

00:12:34.267 --> 00:12:38.234
Notice,
it's the same Web page.

00:12:38.234 --> 00:12:39.634
I'm going to copy this

00:12:39.634 --> 00:12:43.734
and paste it into
the Rich Snippets testing tool,

00:12:43.734 --> 00:12:48.734
and you'll see
we have new output.

00:12:48.734 --> 00:12:53.634
We've got, here in the center,
the Google Search preview.

00:12:53.634 --> 00:12:56.234
So, if we were to return
a Rich Snippet

00:12:56.234 --> 00:12:58.033
in the search engine
results page,

00:12:58.033 --> 00:13:00.133
it might look
something like this.

00:13:00.133 --> 00:13:01.901
And down at the bottom
is my favorite part.

00:13:01.901 --> 00:13:05.601
It tells us all the data
that it found.

00:13:05.601 --> 00:13:07.567
So, if we thought we were
marking something up

00:13:07.567 --> 00:13:09.067
and it's not listed here,

00:13:09.067 --> 00:13:10.868
there's a problem
somewhere along the way.

00:13:10.868 --> 00:13:13.501
Likely, we put in
the wrong item prop,

00:13:13.501 --> 00:13:15.734
or we put that attribute
in the wrong place,

00:13:15.734 --> 00:13:17.467
or it was looking
for the value somewhere else.

00:13:17.467 --> 00:13:19.501
And so, at this point,
we'd look back at our code

00:13:19.501 --> 00:13:22.601
and see if we could
find the error.

00:13:22.601 --> 00:13:24.734
Really straightforward, right?

00:13:24.734 --> 00:13:28.834
Okay.

00:13:28.834 --> 00:13:30.868
All right, let's add in
a few more properties.

00:13:30.868 --> 00:13:32.734
You'll notice
some of these properties

00:13:32.734 --> 00:13:34.701
are going to change
how the Rich Snippet looks,

00:13:34.701 --> 00:13:36.634
and some of them aren't.

00:13:36.634 --> 00:13:40.901
But since we have the data,
we might as well mark it all up.

00:13:40.901 --> 00:13:44.868
So, in this case,
I'm going to add a URL,

00:13:44.868 --> 00:13:49.400
the description, the end date,
and the event type.

00:13:49.400 --> 00:13:51.801
All of that data
was already on the page,

00:13:51.801 --> 00:13:53.701
so I'm just going to
mark it up,

00:13:53.701 --> 00:13:57.267
and it'll look
something like this.

00:13:57.267 --> 00:13:59.801
And you can see I've added
the description right there,

00:13:59.801 --> 00:14:02.334
added the item prop
and a span.

00:14:02.334 --> 00:14:03.767
I've added the end date.

00:14:03.767 --> 00:14:06.234
Both those dates
have the ISO time

00:14:06.234 --> 00:14:09.934
and then a readable time.

00:14:09.934 --> 00:14:14.501
And down here at the location,
I have the locality.

00:14:16.767 --> 00:14:19.100
Oh, and an event type down there
at the bottom.

00:14:19.100 --> 00:14:22.334
And we'll take a look
at what this looks like.

00:14:33.067 --> 00:14:35.467
So, you can see
a couple things have changed.

00:14:35.467 --> 00:14:40.534
One, I have a lot more data
down at the bottom.

00:14:40.534 --> 00:14:43.133
Another,
up at the search preview,

00:14:43.133 --> 00:14:47.000
you can see it's added
the locality to the location.

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:49.067
So, a number of things
didn't make it to the Snippet,

00:14:49.067 --> 00:14:50.901
but it's still good that
we've indicated to the world

00:14:50.901 --> 00:14:52.334
that those are on the page,

00:14:52.334 --> 00:14:55.200
and maybe we can take use
of those in the future.

00:14:55.200 --> 00:14:57.834
But then some things do
update the Snippet.

00:14:57.834 --> 00:14:59.634
See how that works?

00:14:59.634 --> 00:15:02.434
And all I've done
is added a few attributes

00:15:02.434 --> 00:15:05.701
and a couple span tags
to surround data.

00:15:05.701 --> 00:15:08.434
I've not added anything
to the page,

00:15:08.434 --> 00:15:11.000
other than markup.

00:15:13.934 --> 00:15:16.601
So, let's talk about scaling.

00:15:16.601 --> 00:15:18.834
This is the easy part,
actually.

00:15:18.834 --> 00:15:21.901
If you've got a site like this,

00:15:21.901 --> 00:15:25.634
where a database
backs your pages,

00:15:25.634 --> 00:15:29.267
and, hopefully, that database
is a field-level database.

00:15:29.267 --> 00:15:33.667
If it looks something like this,
then it's easy.

00:15:33.667 --> 00:15:35.801
Likely, you're not writing
your pages.

00:15:35.801 --> 00:15:39.601
You're editing templates.

00:15:39.601 --> 00:15:42.501
So, where we have the summary,
location, and start date

00:15:42.501 --> 00:15:46.400
in an event field
in some database,

00:15:46.400 --> 00:15:48.300
we can just add those
to the template

00:15:48.300 --> 00:15:50.767
and make sure
that the markup's there.

00:15:50.767 --> 00:15:53.667
When we change the template
for, say, product pages--

00:15:53.667 --> 00:15:56.033
maybe there's 5,000 of them
on our site,

00:15:56.033 --> 00:15:58.868
but one template--
we mark up that one template,

00:15:58.868 --> 00:16:02.901
and all of those product pages
get the markup.

00:16:02.901 --> 00:16:04.200
This is kind of obvious,

00:16:04.200 --> 00:16:05.868
but I think
it's important to note

00:16:05.868 --> 00:16:07.334
that when you edit
your templates

00:16:07.334 --> 00:16:08.734
to include this markup,

00:16:08.734 --> 00:16:11.667
you've added it
to your whole site.

00:16:16.234 --> 00:16:18.767
Another thing, Sitemaps.

00:16:18.767 --> 00:16:20.634
This is also kind of
a scaling issue.

00:16:20.634 --> 00:16:24.901
We'll get to that.
This is where we are.

00:16:24.901 --> 00:16:26.868
We've got a database
driving a site,

00:16:26.868 --> 00:16:29.300
driving the Google index,
driving search results,

00:16:29.300 --> 00:16:32.067
and the Google index
will find pages on our site

00:16:32.067 --> 00:16:34.868
as it can
and when it can.

00:16:34.868 --> 00:16:37.868
But wouldn't it be cool
if we could tell Google

00:16:37.868 --> 00:16:40.234
what pages are on our site?

00:16:40.234 --> 00:16:43.100
These are all the pages
I want you to know about.

00:16:43.100 --> 00:16:45.234
Wouldn't it be also cool
if we could tell it

00:16:45.234 --> 00:16:49.767
these pages change daily
or these pages change weekly?

00:16:49.767 --> 00:16:51.133
And that's what
Sitemaps are about,

00:16:51.133 --> 00:16:53.434
and they've been around
for a while.

00:16:53.434 --> 00:16:57.067
Essentially, you've got your
database driving your Sitemap,

00:16:57.067 --> 00:17:00.434
and your Sitemap
goes to the Google index,

00:17:00.434 --> 00:17:04.133
and then Google knows
when to look for new data

00:17:04.133 --> 00:17:08.067
and where to look
for new data on your site.

00:17:08.067 --> 00:17:11.968
Let's take a quick look
at an example here.

00:17:11.968 --> 00:17:15.634
First off, links--
super important to have links.

00:17:15.634 --> 00:17:18.534
Sitemaps.org is where you
can go to for the spec

00:17:18.534 --> 00:17:22.133
that Google and other
search engines use,

00:17:22.133 --> 00:17:26.501
and you can use
/webmasters/tools

00:17:26.501 --> 00:17:28.067
to get a little bit
more control

00:17:28.067 --> 00:17:32.167
over the Sitemaps
that Google sees.

00:17:32.167 --> 00:17:35.734
A typical Sitemap
has these properties.

00:17:35.734 --> 00:17:38.534
You've got a URL set
that encapsulates everything,

00:17:38.534 --> 00:17:40.534
and then you've got
URL entries.

00:17:40.534 --> 00:17:43.934
In those URL entries,
you may indicate the location,

00:17:43.934 --> 00:17:47.133
the last modified date,
the change frequency,

00:17:47.133 --> 00:17:49.133
and the priority
of the page.

00:17:49.133 --> 00:17:51.067
All these are
really straightforward.

00:17:51.067 --> 00:17:54.067
The one that I do want
to mention particularly

00:17:54.067 --> 00:17:55.434
is the priority.

00:17:55.434 --> 00:18:01.200
This is a scale from 0 to 1,
and by default, it's .5,

00:18:01.200 --> 00:18:03.067
and they're relative
to each other.

00:18:03.067 --> 00:18:05.601
So, if you list
all your pages at 1,

00:18:05.601 --> 00:18:07.234
you haven't really done
anything.

00:18:07.234 --> 00:18:10.400
But if you tell Google
this page I want you to have

00:18:10.400 --> 00:18:14.634
a bit more priority for,
say, my home page, right,

00:18:14.634 --> 00:18:16.100
then maybe
some of these product pages

00:18:16.100 --> 00:18:20.133
that are only updating
monthly.

00:18:20.133 --> 00:18:22.467
And this is what the example
might look like.

00:18:22.467 --> 00:18:25.834
So, I've just added in
the home URL of the examples

00:18:25.834 --> 00:18:29.834
I've been using so far
on app engine.

00:18:29.834 --> 00:18:33.567
I've added in a date,
that it changes daily,

00:18:33.567 --> 00:18:36.400
and I've added
the default priority.

00:18:36.400 --> 00:18:39.033
And, of course,
this is really easy to expand

00:18:39.033 --> 00:18:42.300
to include the other pages
on my site as well.

00:18:42.300 --> 00:18:46.067
And maybe once I add those,
I realize my homepage is a .8,

00:18:46.067 --> 00:18:51.000
and these other pages are a .7,
just slightly less in priority.

00:18:55.267 --> 00:18:58.467
And that slide came
a little bit early.

00:18:58.467 --> 00:19:00.501
I want to introduce something
really, really cool,

00:19:00.501 --> 00:19:05.200
but first,
let's look at the tool...

00:19:05.200 --> 00:19:07.534
which is here.

00:19:07.534 --> 00:19:12.501
So, I've got a couple Websites
in Webmaster Tools.

00:19:14.767 --> 00:19:16.901
And I go to site configurations
and Sitemaps.

00:19:16.901 --> 00:19:18.467
Now, in Webmaster Tools,

00:19:18.467 --> 00:19:20.400
before you can start
doing anything,

00:19:20.400 --> 00:19:22.901
you need to have
your site claimed.

00:19:22.901 --> 00:19:26.000
That site needs to be yours,
and that's so not anybody else

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:27.767
in the world
can start telling Google

00:19:27.767 --> 00:19:30.901
about your site for you,
when you don't want them to,

00:19:30.901 --> 00:19:33.434
and that can be as simple
as adding a little file

00:19:33.434 --> 00:19:35.067
in the root directory
of your Website.

00:19:35.067 --> 00:19:36.334
Google scans that

00:19:36.334 --> 00:19:39.100
and knows that you have
right access to your server.

00:19:39.100 --> 00:19:41.868
Once we've done that,
we can submit Sitemaps,

00:19:41.868 --> 00:19:43.734
and that's what
I've done here.

00:19:43.734 --> 00:19:47.534
I've gone to submit a Sitemap,
and I've entered in my URL,

00:19:47.534 --> 00:19:49.367
and that Sitemap appears.

00:19:49.367 --> 00:19:51.534
And every time
that Sitemap changes,

00:19:51.534 --> 00:19:53.067
I can come back

00:19:53.067 --> 00:19:56.367
to Webmaster Tools
and hit "resubmit,"

00:19:56.367 --> 00:19:58.968
put a check mark next to
that Sitemap and hit "resubmit."

00:19:58.968 --> 00:20:00.234
That's cool.

00:20:00.234 --> 00:20:02.234
Google will know the data
that I want available,

00:20:02.234 --> 00:20:06.067
and it'll know when I feel

00:20:06.067 --> 00:20:09.734
it should take a look
at that data.

00:20:09.734 --> 00:20:14.133
You can do Sitemaps with feeds
as well, which is pretty cool.

00:20:14.133 --> 00:20:16.667
And once you start using feeds,
you might start to think,

00:20:16.667 --> 00:20:18.901
"Wouldn't it be cool
if Google can know

00:20:18.901 --> 00:20:22.334
about my data on my Website
as it changes?"

00:20:22.334 --> 00:20:25.000
I've got a database
backing a feed.

00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:28.734
That feed updates
as my database changes.

00:20:28.734 --> 00:20:31.968
It would be cool if Google would
know every time that happens,

00:20:31.968 --> 00:20:34.000
and that's the slide
I showed you.

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:40.567
We have another thing available
to us called PubSubHubbub.

00:20:40.567 --> 00:20:43.601
Who here knows
what PubSubHubbub is?

00:20:43.601 --> 00:20:46.100
A lot of you!
That's great.

00:20:46.100 --> 00:20:48.400
So, I've got a bunch of slides
that are going to be review

00:20:48.400 --> 00:20:51.067
for all of you
that raised your hands.

00:20:51.067 --> 00:20:55.100
We're introducing today
that our Sitemaps

00:20:55.100 --> 00:20:57.901
and Webmaster Tools
will support PubSubHubbub.

00:20:57.901 --> 00:21:02.367
So, when you put
a hub in your feed

00:21:02.367 --> 00:21:04.334
for the Sitemap of your site,
Google will read that

00:21:04.334 --> 00:21:08.167
and subscribe to that feed
and get those real-time updates.

00:21:08.167 --> 00:21:10.200
It will then know
that your site

00:21:10.200 --> 00:21:14.400
and that Sitemap
are ready to crawl.

00:21:14.400 --> 00:21:16.133
It pretty much
looks like this.

00:21:16.133 --> 00:21:19.234
You have the Sitemap.
You add in PubSubHubbub

00:21:19.234 --> 00:21:20.968
so that a fat ping
just hits Google

00:21:20.968 --> 00:21:23.133
every time something happens,

00:21:23.133 --> 00:21:25.400
and then Google knows
that your site is updated

00:21:25.400 --> 00:21:28.767
and can check it
when it can.

00:21:28.767 --> 00:21:31.701
All right, I'm going to go
through PubSubHubbub quickly,

00:21:31.701 --> 00:21:33.634
because there were
a lot of hands.

00:21:33.634 --> 00:21:36.133
Slow me down
if you don't get anything.

00:21:36.133 --> 00:21:38.567
PubSubHubbub is a really
straightforward protocol

00:21:38.567 --> 00:21:42.033
that solves
a very specific problem.

00:21:42.033 --> 00:21:44.133
If you have a feed--

00:21:44.133 --> 00:21:47.767
And I want quick, timely updates
about that feed,

00:21:47.767 --> 00:21:49.234
before PubSubHubbub,

00:21:49.234 --> 00:21:52.434
what I would do
is pull that feed.

00:21:52.434 --> 00:21:54.667
Every 30 seconds,
or 10 seconds,

00:21:54.667 --> 00:21:56.567
I would download
that feed again,

00:21:56.567 --> 00:21:58.434
and I would say,
"Has anything changed?"

00:21:58.434 --> 00:22:00.901
If nothing's changed,
then I don't do anything.

00:22:00.901 --> 00:22:02.334
If something has changed,

00:22:02.334 --> 00:22:06.501
maybe I bubble that up
to a user-facing action.

00:22:08.067 --> 00:22:09.834
But the problem here
is that you have

00:22:09.834 --> 00:22:12.667
lots of publishers
and subscribers.

00:22:12.667 --> 00:22:15.767
Let's say 1,000 subscribers
to one publisher,

00:22:15.767 --> 00:22:18.000
and all of them are asking
every 30 seconds,

00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:20.100
"Are we there yet?"
Right?

00:22:20.100 --> 00:22:21.601
This would be annoying
for a road trip,

00:22:21.601 --> 00:22:24.434
and it's annoying
on the Internet, as well.

00:22:24.434 --> 00:22:26.434
Wouldn't it be cool
if the publisher

00:22:26.434 --> 00:22:30.467
can just tell the subscriber,
"Yes, we're there"?

00:22:30.467 --> 00:22:34.167
And that's what
PubSubHubbub does.

00:22:34.167 --> 00:22:38.067
It works with three things--
a publisher, a subscriber,

00:22:38.067 --> 00:22:39.567
and a hub.

00:22:39.567 --> 00:22:41.734
Get it?
PubSubHub.

00:22:41.734 --> 00:22:44.667
And, of course,
the "bub" is just for fun.

00:22:46.734 --> 00:22:47.968
What will happen is

00:22:47.968 --> 00:22:49.868
the subscriber
will ask the publisher,

00:22:49.868 --> 00:22:51.467
"Can I have your feed?"

00:22:51.467 --> 00:22:56.501
The publisher will respond
and include a link to their hub.

00:22:56.501 --> 00:22:59.234
If the subscriber
is PubSubHubbub aware,

00:22:59.234 --> 00:23:02.934
it will then subscribe
to that hub,

00:23:02.934 --> 00:23:05.801
and this hub will do
a little bit of a dance

00:23:05.801 --> 00:23:08.734
to verify that the subscriber
actually was subscribing,

00:23:08.734 --> 00:23:13.434
and it wasn't an attack
to overload them with data.

00:23:13.434 --> 00:23:15.200
So, it'll say,
"Are you sure you wanted this?"

00:23:15.200 --> 00:23:16.667
The subscriber
will say yes.

00:23:16.667 --> 00:23:18.734
From then on, the publisher

00:23:18.734 --> 00:23:22.734
is going to send data
to the hub,

00:23:22.734 --> 00:23:24.734
and it's going to do it
one of two ways.

00:23:24.734 --> 00:23:27.501
Either the publisher will notify
the hub directly,

00:23:27.501 --> 00:23:30.200
or the hub will continually
pull the publisher

00:23:30.200 --> 00:23:32.601
in that pulling method,
which isn't a big deal now,

00:23:32.601 --> 00:23:34.634
'cause now there's just
one person pulling,

00:23:34.634 --> 00:23:38.200
and that person can do it
at a much higher frequency,

00:23:38.200 --> 00:23:41.000
and that publisher
will give it the data.

00:23:43.868 --> 00:23:46.801
Once the hub has the data,
it sends it to the subscriber.

00:23:46.801 --> 00:23:48.067
That's it.

00:23:48.067 --> 00:23:50.801
It just pushes out a fat ping
and a post.

00:23:50.801 --> 00:23:54.400
This is your data.
This is the update to this feed.

00:23:54.400 --> 00:23:57.601
So what'll happen is,
when your site has an Atom feed

00:23:57.601 --> 00:24:00.767
and it has a link to a hub,
when Google subscribes to that,

00:24:00.767 --> 00:24:03.901
every time you make a change
to your database

00:24:03.901 --> 00:24:06.601
and that gets updated
in your feed,

00:24:06.601 --> 00:24:09.000
that feed will push out
to the hub.

00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:11.667
It will then push out
to Google...

00:24:11.667 --> 00:24:12.834
right through.

00:24:12.834 --> 00:24:14.234
Pretty cool, huh?

00:24:14.234 --> 00:24:18.901
And Google will then know
that it can recrawl your site.

00:24:18.901 --> 00:24:20.334
And, of course,
this works.

00:24:20.334 --> 00:24:25.033
PubSubHubbub is a great protocol
that works at scale, too.

00:24:25.033 --> 00:24:28.901
So it can work with
a huge number of subscribers.

00:24:28.901 --> 00:24:30.133
Let's take a look
at a quick feed.

00:24:30.133 --> 00:24:34.033
This is an Atom feed
with a link,

00:24:34.033 --> 00:24:36.067
which is just right up there.

00:24:36.067 --> 00:24:39.434
It's a link,
a real link to the hub.

00:24:39.434 --> 00:24:42.400
And this is
actually a live feed.

00:24:42.400 --> 00:24:45.167
If I go to...

00:24:51.467 --> 00:24:53.901
I made a blog.

00:24:53.901 --> 00:24:55.934
It doesn't really have
anything interesting on it,

00:24:55.934 --> 00:24:59.267
except, for our purposes,
this link down here.

00:24:59.267 --> 00:25:04.067
Blogger, as it turns out,
has an Atom feed by default

00:25:04.067 --> 00:25:06.868
that includes PubSubHubbub.

00:25:06.868 --> 00:25:09.901
So, I can actually
take this link

00:25:09.901 --> 00:25:14.434
and go to Webmaster Tools,

00:25:14.434 --> 00:25:18.033
and you see I've added in
that link to that feed,

00:25:18.033 --> 00:25:21.901
and it is subscribed
through PubSubHubbub.

00:25:21.901 --> 00:25:23.667
I was actually playing
with this last night.

00:25:23.667 --> 00:25:26.167
I would post a new message
on my blog,

00:25:26.167 --> 00:25:27.968
and then sometime later,

00:25:27.968 --> 00:25:31.267
I would just see it
automatically show up here.

00:25:31.267 --> 00:25:33.334
Pretty cool, huh?

00:25:38.934 --> 00:25:40.734
So, that's pretty much
all you need.

00:25:40.734 --> 00:25:42.400
You create a Sitemap feed,

00:25:42.400 --> 00:25:46.968
and that can be an RSS,
mRSS, or Atom.

00:25:46.968 --> 00:25:53.400
Use a hub, a PubSubHubbub hub
and indicate that in the feed,

00:25:53.400 --> 00:25:56.901
and then add the link
in Webmaster Tools.

00:25:56.901 --> 00:25:58.667
Data in Webmaster Tools,
by the way,

00:25:58.667 --> 00:26:02.033
is updated after Google
crawls the site.

00:26:02.033 --> 00:26:05.300
So, there may be some delay
in actually updating your blog

00:26:05.300 --> 00:26:07.167
and seeing that
in Webmaster Tools.

00:26:07.167 --> 00:26:09.667
Don't expect it
just to pop up.

00:26:13.968 --> 00:26:16.167
All right, so let's talk
a little bit about the future.

00:26:16.167 --> 00:26:18.000
What's next?

00:26:20.968 --> 00:26:22.868
So, this is us
with Rich Snippets,

00:26:22.868 --> 00:26:26.834
and PubSubHubbub Sitemaps.

00:26:26.834 --> 00:26:29.300
We've got
a database-backed Website

00:26:29.300 --> 00:26:33.033
that pushes to the content
of our pages,

00:26:33.033 --> 00:26:37.200
and that markup
is also structured

00:26:37.200 --> 00:26:40.701
so that those entities
are identified on those pages.

00:26:40.701 --> 00:26:43.167
The database also updates
a Sitemap,

00:26:43.167 --> 00:26:47.667
so Google knows what our
content is and when it changes.

00:26:49.901 --> 00:26:51.901
And then we've got
this cool stuff

00:26:51.901 --> 00:26:54.501
over in the search engine
results page.

00:26:54.501 --> 00:26:57.167
And what we can expect
in the future, for sure,

00:26:57.167 --> 00:26:59.367
is more Rich Snippet types,
perhaps.

00:26:59.367 --> 00:27:00.834
We just added prayer times,

00:27:00.834 --> 00:27:02.534
and there's a lot of
different discreet entities

00:27:02.534 --> 00:27:04.567
that would be cool
and interesting to show

00:27:04.567 --> 00:27:06.467
in the search engine
results page.

00:27:06.467 --> 00:27:09.133
We're also going to do more
with that data.

00:27:09.133 --> 00:27:11.968
For example, we can include
that data in vertical searches,

00:27:11.968 --> 00:27:14.634
and we've just recently
released this feature.

00:27:14.634 --> 00:27:16.367
I don't know
if you've seen it yet,

00:27:16.367 --> 00:27:21.667
but I had a screenshot earlier
of a stuffing search.

00:27:21.667 --> 00:27:24.901
You'll notice, when I look
down here at the left,

00:27:24.901 --> 00:27:27.667
I can narrow my search
by ingredients,

00:27:27.667 --> 00:27:31.234
and that's because
these Webmasters have identified

00:27:31.234 --> 00:27:35.367
the ingredients in their recipes
with Structured Markup.

00:27:35.367 --> 00:27:37.467
So, as I select,
say, I don't know,

00:27:37.467 --> 00:27:41.267
turkey,
maybe I don't have turkey.

00:27:41.267 --> 00:27:47.200
Maybe I have sherry,
and maybe I have steak.

00:27:47.200 --> 00:27:50.400
Here is a grilled flank steak
with mushroom stuffing.

00:27:50.400 --> 00:27:52.934
That sounds fantastic.

00:27:52.934 --> 00:27:57.501
And I can indicate I don't have
more than 60 minutes.

00:27:57.501 --> 00:28:01.667
Apparently, that takes
a while to cook,

00:28:01.667 --> 00:28:07.400
or the other fear is that
it doesn't exist for my diet.

00:28:07.400 --> 00:28:09.467
[laughter]

00:28:09.467 --> 00:28:11.000
You can see
how this is really cool,

00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:12.968
that we can do
not just Rich Snippets.

00:28:12.968 --> 00:28:15.100
Not only do you get more control
over how you look

00:28:15.100 --> 00:28:16.968
in search engine results,

00:28:16.968 --> 00:28:18.968
but we can do cool new things
with that data,

00:28:18.968 --> 00:28:22.968
like this vertical search
with recipes--

00:28:22.968 --> 00:28:24.634
and it all starts here.

00:28:24.634 --> 00:28:27.334
By mirroring the data
in your database

00:28:27.334 --> 00:28:30.601
on both your Web pages
and your Sitemap,

00:28:30.601 --> 00:28:33.434
and on those Web pages
using Structured Markup,

00:28:33.434 --> 00:28:38.167
your Website becomes
more like your database.

00:28:41.100 --> 00:28:42.868
By telling Google this
right away,

00:28:42.868 --> 00:28:44.400
that data is more known

00:28:44.400 --> 00:28:48.467
and more useful and available
for your users.

00:28:48.467 --> 00:28:50.601
The more this happens,
the more the whole Web

00:28:50.601 --> 00:28:52.901
starts to become
more of a database,

00:28:52.901 --> 00:28:54.968
the more we can start to do
really cool things

00:28:54.968 --> 00:28:58.234
with that data.

00:28:58.234 --> 00:28:59.767
Pretty cool, huh?

00:28:59.767 --> 00:29:02.400
All right,
so, to summarize,

00:29:02.400 --> 00:29:06.267
the practical elements of this
talk is markup is super easy.

00:29:06.267 --> 00:29:08.167
You don't have to add
anything new to your site.

00:29:08.167 --> 00:29:12.200
You just have to tell us
what it is.

00:29:12.200 --> 00:29:14.734
Scaling
is pretty straightforward.

00:29:14.734 --> 00:29:17.300
All you really need to do
is edit your templates

00:29:17.300 --> 00:29:20.167
instead of the end pages.

00:29:20.167 --> 00:29:22.834
Markup is good.
Yeah?

00:29:22.834 --> 00:29:24.834
Rich Snippets
are really cool,

00:29:24.834 --> 00:29:26.567
and vertical searches
are really cool,

00:29:26.567 --> 00:29:28.000
and users appreciate them.

00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:30.000
Not only that,
but you have more control.

00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:34.701
You now get to tell Google
what data is there,

00:29:34.701 --> 00:29:37.434
using Sitemaps
and using structured data,

00:29:37.434 --> 00:29:39.234
what data is actually
on the page

00:29:39.234 --> 00:29:41.534
and what pages have data.

00:29:41.534 --> 00:29:43.868
And, of course,
the Sitemap tells Google

00:29:43.868 --> 00:29:46.601
what pages should be crawled
and when they've changed,

00:29:46.601 --> 00:29:49.000
so they can update them.

00:29:53.400 --> 00:29:54.868
And this all leads, again--

00:29:54.868 --> 00:29:56.667
this practical application
that happens today

00:29:56.667 --> 00:29:58.868
is more control over
how you appear,

00:29:58.868 --> 00:30:01.400
and Rich Snippets
and Sitemaps give you that.

00:30:01.400 --> 00:30:03.534
It allows you to control traffic
and engagement,

00:30:03.534 --> 00:30:07.200
and it gives you more control
so that using that control,

00:30:07.200 --> 00:30:10.234
people know what's so great
about your pages.

00:30:10.234 --> 00:30:13.868
You let your users see
the richness of every page

00:30:13.868 --> 00:30:15.901
when they're looking for them.

00:30:15.901 --> 00:30:18.167
I think that's pretty neat.

00:30:18.167 --> 00:30:21.100
All right, that's pretty much
all I have to say on that,

00:30:21.100 --> 00:30:24.634
except for the answers
to any questions you may have.

00:30:24.634 --> 00:30:26.634
I hope that was interesting
and straightforward,

00:30:26.634 --> 00:30:29.100
but I would love to talk
about it further.

00:30:29.100 --> 00:30:30.968
So, we have a microphone
in the center

00:30:30.968 --> 00:30:33.067
and a microphone
way over there.

00:30:33.067 --> 00:30:35.868
And if you want to go up
and ask some questions,

00:30:35.868 --> 00:30:38.534
I'm here to answer them,
and we have some other Googlers

00:30:38.534 --> 00:30:40.634
who are experts
in this area here

00:30:40.634 --> 00:30:42.601
available to answer as well.

00:30:42.601 --> 00:30:46.400
Daniel up here might be
popping up and saying hello.

00:30:46.400 --> 00:30:48.834
Yes.

00:30:48.834 --> 00:30:51.234
man: So, if we've got
a new kind of entity

00:30:51.234 --> 00:30:54.100
that we wish Google would make
into a Rich Snippet--

00:30:54.100 --> 00:30:55.267
Jordan:
Yes?

00:30:55.267 --> 00:30:56.901
man: We happen to be
a real-estate site.

00:30:56.901 --> 00:30:59.300
We would like
"three beds, four baths"

00:30:59.300 --> 00:31:02.567
to appear
in a Rich Snippet.

00:31:02.567 --> 00:31:05.634
My understanding, will we need
to build an industry consortium

00:31:05.634 --> 00:31:08.234
to make a standard
around the microformat?

00:31:08.234 --> 00:31:11.434
Is that step one?

00:31:11.434 --> 00:31:13.067
Jordan:
Well, there's two things.

00:31:13.067 --> 00:31:14.701
One is being able
to identify the data,

00:31:14.701 --> 00:31:16.400
and, yes, you've indicated
that, right?

00:31:16.400 --> 00:31:20.200
Like having
microformats or microdata

00:31:20.200 --> 00:31:22.901
able to specify that is great,
and microformats in RDFa

00:31:22.901 --> 00:31:23.968
are really good for this,

00:31:23.968 --> 00:31:25.501
because they're already
pretty general.

00:31:25.501 --> 00:31:28.234
The other thing is convincing
Google that that would be, like,

00:31:28.234 --> 00:31:29.601
good for the users.

00:31:29.601 --> 00:31:32.567
And so the best step there
is to go to the Webmaster Forum

00:31:32.567 --> 00:31:34.834
and make it known,
"This is a Rich Snippet

00:31:34.834 --> 00:31:36.567
that we think would be really
valuable to the users,

00:31:36.567 --> 00:31:37.901
and we're ready
to mark this up,"

00:31:37.901 --> 00:31:41.167
or, "We've already marked
our pages up with this."

00:31:41.167 --> 00:31:43.801
Would you add
anything to that?

00:31:43.801 --> 00:31:47.000
We can share a mic.

00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:48.868
Daniel: I've never talked
to your chest before.

00:31:48.868 --> 00:31:50.834
[laughter]

00:31:50.834 --> 00:31:52.901
Jordan: I'm sure they can bring
up a mic in a sec,

00:31:52.901 --> 00:31:55.067
but I'll hand this
over to you.

00:31:55.067 --> 00:31:56.434
Daniel:
Great. Thanks.

00:31:56.434 --> 00:31:59.968
Yeah, I think
that's a great direction

00:31:59.968 --> 00:32:02.868
that we want to pursue
in the future.

00:32:02.868 --> 00:32:07.367
One of the great things
about both RDFa and microdata

00:32:07.367 --> 00:32:09.934
is that you don't have to form
an industry consortium.

00:32:09.934 --> 00:32:12.801
You can mark up the data
that you already have

00:32:12.801 --> 00:32:17.467
on your page in a forum
that makes sense to you.

00:32:17.467 --> 00:32:19.767
That starts
the conversation, right?

00:32:19.767 --> 00:32:21.734
That starts the conversation
when you post a link

00:32:21.734 --> 00:32:23.300
in a Webmaster Forum.

00:32:23.300 --> 00:32:26.934
That starts a conversation
with other Webmasters

00:32:26.934 --> 00:32:30.634
about what data is interesting
to other sites.

00:32:30.634 --> 00:32:32.067
It starts a conversation
with Google

00:32:32.067 --> 00:32:37.667
about what you're
able to mark up.

00:32:37.667 --> 00:32:42.634
So, I would say that
that's the beginning--

00:32:42.634 --> 00:32:45.501
thanks a lot--
and over time,

00:32:45.501 --> 00:32:47.467
we'll have some better answers
to this question.

00:32:47.467 --> 00:32:51.334
It's a critical part...

00:32:56.234 --> 00:32:58.100
Jordan:
Hello, hello.

00:32:58.100 --> 00:33:00.501
man: Well, I'm certainly open
to the idea.

00:33:00.501 --> 00:33:01.734
What you just described is,

00:33:01.734 --> 00:33:03.000
"Oh, you should just
mark up your site,

00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:05.000
"and then post
in the forums.

00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:07.067
Maybe someone will notice."

00:33:07.067 --> 00:33:10.167
I'm not sure
if anyone's going to notice--

00:33:10.167 --> 00:33:12.000
A random post
on the Webmasters Forums?

00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:14.167
Really?

00:33:14.167 --> 00:33:16.033
Jordan:
I read the forums.

00:33:16.033 --> 00:33:18.133
[laughter]
man: All of them?

00:33:18.133 --> 00:33:20.033
They get
a little noisy sometimes.

00:33:20.033 --> 00:33:21.901
Daniel: Seriously, there are
a lot of people at Google

00:33:21.901 --> 00:33:23.234
who do read the forums.

00:33:23.234 --> 00:33:26.534
But, yes, I think you've really
highlighted an issue

00:33:26.534 --> 00:33:31.267
that this is a person-to-person
negotiation right now, right?

00:33:31.267 --> 00:33:33.133
That part is not scalable.

00:33:33.133 --> 00:33:35.934
That's why Timothy's talk
on Scalable Structured Markup

00:33:35.934 --> 00:33:38.400
didn't include that topic.

00:33:38.400 --> 00:33:42.667
And so, yes,
it's socialization.

00:33:42.667 --> 00:33:48.067
It is developing
a groundswell of support,

00:33:48.067 --> 00:33:50.234
but we recognize
that that's not ideal.

00:33:50.234 --> 00:33:53.234
So, we look forward
to coming up

00:33:53.234 --> 00:33:55.334
with better answers to that
over time.

00:33:55.334 --> 00:33:58.067
It's a serious problem
that we recognize.

00:33:58.067 --> 00:34:00.667
[man speaking indistinctly]

00:34:00.667 --> 00:34:02.400
man: That is
an industry consortium.

00:34:02.400 --> 00:34:04.400
I need to build an industry
consortium of people who--

00:34:04.400 --> 00:34:06.234
man: It's not
an industry consortium.

00:34:06.234 --> 00:34:08.801
It's a Wiki page that you go to
and a process that says...

00:34:08.801 --> 00:34:10.534
man: Okay, I'll post
on the forum,

00:34:10.534 --> 00:34:12.767
and I'll post onto Wiki.
Maybe someone will notice.

00:34:12.767 --> 00:34:14.067
Daniel:
Gentlemen--

00:34:14.067 --> 00:34:16.067
Jordan: Clearly, we all feel
passionately about this.

00:34:16.067 --> 00:34:18.868
We don't all have microphones.

00:34:18.868 --> 00:34:20.234
Daniel:
So, please, yes,

00:34:20.234 --> 00:34:22.067
please come up afterwards
and chat.

00:34:22.067 --> 00:34:23.501
Jordan:
Yeah.

00:34:23.501 --> 00:34:25.234
Daniel: I would love to have
a longer conversation with you

00:34:25.234 --> 00:34:26.467
about how to
make that work better.

00:34:26.467 --> 00:34:27.467
man:
All right, thank you.

00:34:27.467 --> 00:34:29.400
Jordan:
Yeah, please do.

00:34:29.400 --> 00:34:34.067
[man speaking indistinctly]

00:34:34.067 --> 00:34:35.567
Jordan: All right,
let's go over here

00:34:35.567 --> 00:34:37.901
for the next question.

00:34:37.901 --> 00:34:39.868
man: A common response
that I see on my test page--

00:34:39.868 --> 00:34:42.033
on my test page or
the testing tool that you have

00:34:42.033 --> 00:34:45.667
is, "We couldn't find
the subject of your page."

00:34:45.667 --> 00:34:48.467
So, I've included maybe
too much structured markup,

00:34:48.467 --> 00:34:53.067
and I wasn't able to tell you
the exact subject of the page.

00:34:53.067 --> 00:34:55.100
Say, it's a profile page
for a person,

00:34:55.100 --> 00:34:57.701
and I really want this
to be the highlighted noun,

00:34:57.701 --> 00:35:00.567
and I included too many of
Spinal Tap's upcoming concerts

00:35:00.567 --> 00:35:02.834
in the sidebar and videos
or whatever else.

00:35:02.834 --> 00:35:06.400
So, what do you recommend
for highlighting--

00:35:06.400 --> 00:35:07.901
It could be an area roll
or something--

00:35:07.901 --> 00:35:11.834
the subjects of the noun
that you really care about

00:35:11.834 --> 00:35:14.868
for that page?

00:35:14.868 --> 00:35:16.100
Jordan:
That's a very good question.

00:35:16.100 --> 00:35:18.334
I don't have
an immediate answer, do you?

00:35:18.334 --> 00:35:22.501
Daniel:
Yeah, that markup, ideally,

00:35:22.501 --> 00:35:25.334
in a large
scalable site, right,

00:35:25.334 --> 00:35:27.901
you have records in your
database, as Timothy described.

00:35:27.901 --> 00:35:30.367
You have records
in your database that describe

00:35:30.367 --> 00:35:33.067
each part of the page.

00:35:33.067 --> 00:35:38.100
Focus on, you know,
what that page is about.

00:35:38.100 --> 00:35:41.167
Focus on the record
that backs it.

00:35:41.167 --> 00:35:45.000
This markup is really
specialized right now

00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:49.434
to pages that are
single-item pages.

00:35:49.434 --> 00:35:52.367
It's possible to do more,
but, honestly,

00:35:52.367 --> 00:35:56.467
Google isn't so good
at that right today.

00:35:56.467 --> 00:35:57.901
Jordan:
That's a really good point.

00:35:57.901 --> 00:35:59.567
When you markup your pages,

00:35:59.567 --> 00:36:02.868
do you open up the
Webmaster Help Center article

00:36:02.868 --> 00:36:05.167
for that Rich Snippet type
and try and hit that,

00:36:05.167 --> 00:36:06.834
or do you just
add the data?

00:36:06.834 --> 00:36:08.601
man: Yeah, and I go to
your data-vocabulary.org

00:36:08.601 --> 00:36:12.367
and read the exact specs to what
I should be putting on there.

00:36:12.367 --> 00:36:14.734
Jordan:
So data-vocabulary.org is great,

00:36:14.734 --> 00:36:16.601
but if your goal
is Rich Snippets,

00:36:16.601 --> 00:36:18.767
at least
in my personal experience,

00:36:18.767 --> 00:36:20.234
editing and adding
the structured markup,

00:36:20.234 --> 00:36:23.934
the Webmaster Help Center pages
will give you an example,

00:36:23.934 --> 00:36:27.067
like, "This is a Snippet that,

00:36:27.067 --> 00:36:31.067
like, could give a Rich Snippet
on search engine results pages."

00:36:31.067 --> 00:36:32.934
Does that make sense?

00:36:32.934 --> 00:36:34.934
Whereas Data Vocabulary
is the spec,

00:36:34.934 --> 00:36:36.801
and it's like
everything you can do,

00:36:36.801 --> 00:36:38.267
the Webmaster page will say,

00:36:38.267 --> 00:36:41.067
"This is something that--this is
a good example of the page

00:36:41.067 --> 00:36:44.367
that would get
a Rich Snippet."

00:36:44.367 --> 00:36:46.834
Daniel: It sounds like you have
a particular problem

00:36:46.834 --> 00:36:48.267
that we're not serving
very well, so--

00:36:48.267 --> 00:36:50.100
man: I think I'm too expressive,
and you're asking me

00:36:50.100 --> 00:36:52.234
to just dumb it down for you,
and so I'm wondering how--

00:36:52.234 --> 00:36:53.667
Jordan:
That's hard.

00:36:53.667 --> 00:36:57.601
man: And so I'm wondering
how do you change for time?

00:36:57.601 --> 00:36:59.234
I've heard, like,
"Oh, they notice

00:36:59.234 --> 00:37:01.167
"when something comes up
in the testing tool

00:37:01.167 --> 00:37:02.701
that didn't quite work out."

00:37:02.701 --> 00:37:04.267
Kind of like
the forums question--

00:37:04.267 --> 00:37:07.601
Do you tend to see
that that happened?

00:37:07.601 --> 00:37:10.601
So, if I list Spinal Tap,
and I say bands like Spinal Tap,

00:37:10.601 --> 00:37:13.400
and each of those has a little
person markup within them,

00:37:13.400 --> 00:37:15.200
but the main object
is Spinal Tap,

00:37:15.200 --> 00:37:16.901
and there's so many different
things you can do,

00:37:16.901 --> 00:37:18.400
where it's all valid markup.

00:37:18.400 --> 00:37:21.033
It's all very descriptive,
but it might take away

00:37:21.033 --> 00:37:23.300
from you finding
the exact subject of the page.

00:37:23.300 --> 00:37:24.734
Jordan:
So, to Daniel's point, yeah,

00:37:24.734 --> 00:37:27.167
it sounds like that there is
a conversation to be had here,

00:37:27.167 --> 00:37:28.868
and there's some changes
that we could make

00:37:28.868 --> 00:37:30.734
to better address
your use case.

00:37:30.734 --> 00:37:33.133
So, if you wouldn't mind,
come up afterwards,

00:37:33.133 --> 00:37:36.234
and we'll talk about it
in more depth.

00:37:36.234 --> 00:37:37.334
Yes?
man: I want to thank you

00:37:37.334 --> 00:37:39.300
for the prayer times
in the Snippet.

00:37:39.300 --> 00:37:40.767
Jordan:
Oh, you're welcome.

00:37:40.767 --> 00:37:42.000
man:
I saw the talk this morning,

00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:45.200
what places API from Geo.

00:37:45.200 --> 00:37:47.667
So, the question,
of course, is,

00:37:47.667 --> 00:37:52.400
how do we add
the places information

00:37:52.400 --> 00:37:56.167
and inform through
the Webmaster site tools?

00:37:59.334 --> 00:38:02.734
Daniel: So, I'm not sure
that I grasp your question.

00:38:02.734 --> 00:38:04.067
Jordan:
I think the question is,

00:38:04.067 --> 00:38:06.267
how can you add in
places information?

00:38:06.267 --> 00:38:08.701
man: Places API that they
announced this morning

00:38:08.701 --> 00:38:10.801
on Google Maps.

00:38:10.801 --> 00:38:12.234
Jordan:
So, what's the end goal?

00:38:12.234 --> 00:38:15.167
By adding in this information,
what do you want to see happen?

00:38:15.167 --> 00:38:19.801
man: So, if I have a Website
that has got different events

00:38:19.801 --> 00:38:24.200
at different locations or places
that I manage and control,

00:38:24.200 --> 00:38:27.834
so I can upload
that information.

00:38:27.834 --> 00:38:29.634
Jordan: So, there are
a number of different ways

00:38:29.634 --> 00:38:31.367
that you can address
that problem,

00:38:31.367 --> 00:38:33.901
and one of the ways
is to add Structured Markup.

00:38:33.901 --> 00:38:35.434
And I believe
there is another way

00:38:35.434 --> 00:38:39.467
that we can get local
information to Google as well.

00:38:39.467 --> 00:38:41.868
Daniel:
Yes, the local story--

00:38:41.868 --> 00:38:43.567
there are a couple
of different ways

00:38:43.567 --> 00:38:45.234
to provide local information,

00:38:45.234 --> 00:38:47.033
and one is through
Google Places itself.

00:38:47.033 --> 00:38:48.601
Jordan:
Mm-hmm.

00:38:48.601 --> 00:38:53.100
Daniel: There's a feed format
for local places.

00:38:53.100 --> 00:38:55.367
So, if you want to use
the Places API today,

00:38:55.367 --> 00:38:57.133
that's probably
the best place to do that.

00:38:57.133 --> 00:38:58.567
man:
Okay.

00:38:58.567 --> 00:39:02.100
Daniel: If your audience is more
a broader Web audience today,

00:39:02.100 --> 00:39:04.767
the best place to do that
would be Markup on a Web page.

00:39:04.767 --> 00:39:06.267
man:
Thank you.

00:39:06.267 --> 00:39:08.734
Jordan:
Thank you.

00:39:08.734 --> 00:39:10.400
And over here.

00:39:10.400 --> 00:39:11.801
man: Hi.
I'm curious.

00:39:11.801 --> 00:39:14.133
How many of the new HTML5 tags

00:39:14.133 --> 00:39:15.968
will Google's search engine
recognize,

00:39:15.968 --> 00:39:19.267
like, article,
section, nav,

00:39:19.267 --> 00:39:21.033
footer, header,
things like that?

00:39:21.033 --> 00:39:22.734
Jordan: In general,
we'd like to use

00:39:22.734 --> 00:39:24.234
as much data as available,

00:39:24.234 --> 00:39:26.601
and that includes all different
kinds of markup types.

00:39:26.601 --> 00:39:28.667
And when we find
a good use case for that,

00:39:28.667 --> 00:39:30.434
then we'll start
reading data.

00:39:30.434 --> 00:39:34.267
I don't have any specific
information beyond that today.

00:39:34.267 --> 00:39:37.300
Daniel: Yeah, the only thing
I'd add to that is

00:39:37.300 --> 00:39:38.567
there's a difference

00:39:38.567 --> 00:39:41.234
between the level of structure
that's expressed

00:39:41.234 --> 00:39:43.434
and the level of richness
that's expressed

00:39:43.434 --> 00:39:45.567
in those HTML5 standard tags

00:39:45.567 --> 00:39:49.133
and those that are really
necessary to hoist

00:39:49.133 --> 00:39:51.534
more information
onto the search results page

00:39:51.534 --> 00:39:55.000
to make your page stand out,
to make your site stand out.

00:39:55.000 --> 00:39:59.667
There really isn't much
that we have been able to do

00:39:59.667 --> 00:40:01.000
with the article tags,

00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:04.367
as they're used
on the Web today,

00:40:04.367 --> 00:40:07.567
you know, because many people
use them incorrectly

00:40:07.567 --> 00:40:12.467
or use them even on things
that aren't articles and so on.

00:40:12.467 --> 00:40:15.734
So, that's something that
we're continuously looking at

00:40:15.734 --> 00:40:19.501
in Search to see
how we can use them.

00:40:21.267 --> 00:40:24.067
man: Hi. I was wondering
if you know to what degree

00:40:24.067 --> 00:40:26.934
some of these technologies,

00:40:26.934 --> 00:40:28.968
like Rich Snippet support
and PubSubHubbub

00:40:28.968 --> 00:40:32.133
are supported in products
like the Google Search appliance

00:40:32.133 --> 00:40:33.400
for Internet search,

00:40:33.400 --> 00:40:38.067
so we can do this kind of thing
with our local content?

00:40:38.067 --> 00:40:40.634
Jordan: So, maybe you could
speak to the search appliance,

00:40:40.634 --> 00:40:42.934
but for custom search engine,

00:40:42.934 --> 00:40:44.701
you definitely can use
Rich Snippets

00:40:44.701 --> 00:40:48.067
to affect how those look on
your own custom search engine.

00:40:48.067 --> 00:40:50.300
And, in fact, we take it
even a level further

00:40:50.300 --> 00:40:53.734
with custom search engine
and give you even more control

00:40:53.734 --> 00:40:57.467
over how everything looks,
using page--

00:40:57.467 --> 00:40:59.234
Daniel: Page maps.
Jordan: Page maps.

00:40:59.234 --> 00:41:00.801
That's the one.

00:41:00.801 --> 00:41:03.901
Daniel: Yeah, sorry, I don't
know about how this relates

00:41:03.901 --> 00:41:05.501
to the Google Search
appliance,

00:41:05.501 --> 00:41:08.033
but I could take
your card afterwards

00:41:08.033 --> 00:41:10.167
and put you in touch
with someone who might.

00:41:10.167 --> 00:41:13.434
man:
Okay, thank you.

00:41:13.434 --> 00:41:18.100
man: If we were to add
a PubSubHubbub Sitemap feed,

00:41:18.100 --> 00:41:23.200
should we then remove
the old style standard Sitemap,

00:41:23.200 --> 00:41:25.567
or should we keep them both?

00:41:25.567 --> 00:41:28.434
Jordan: Well, so,
not everybody out there

00:41:28.434 --> 00:41:32.100
is going to support
the feed and PubSubHubbub,

00:41:32.100 --> 00:41:35.133
so it makes more sense
to include both

00:41:35.133 --> 00:41:36.534
and just have your database
drive them,

00:41:36.534 --> 00:41:38.033
so you don't need to
worry about them,

00:41:38.033 --> 00:41:39.567
and then tell Google
about the one

00:41:39.567 --> 00:41:41.100
that you want Google to use.

00:41:41.100 --> 00:41:43.767
man: Got it. So, Google's
crawler can use both,

00:41:43.767 --> 00:41:45.968
and you can say,
"Opt for this one."

00:41:45.968 --> 00:41:47.267
Jordan: Yes.
man: Okay, and--

00:41:47.267 --> 00:41:49.067
Jordan: Just indicate
that in Webmaster Tools,

00:41:49.067 --> 00:41:50.901
which one you want Google
to use.

00:41:50.901 --> 00:41:52.067
man:
Right.

00:41:52.067 --> 00:41:53.868
I think that I've noticed
in the past,

00:41:53.868 --> 00:41:56.901
you know, that we put a lot
of links on our Sitemap,

00:41:56.901 --> 00:41:58.734
and Google
will crawl some of them,

00:41:58.734 --> 00:42:00.734
but not necessarily
all of them.

00:42:00.734 --> 00:42:02.501
If we use PubSubHubbub,

00:42:02.501 --> 00:42:06.400
is that a good way to make sure
that at least the freshest stuff

00:42:06.400 --> 00:42:08.367
gets crawled
more consistently,

00:42:08.367 --> 00:42:12.000
or does it not necessarily
impact that?

00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:15.133
Daniel: Right now,
it doesn't impact that at all,

00:42:15.133 --> 00:42:17.834
but one of the advantages
of PubSubHubbub

00:42:17.834 --> 00:42:21.868
is that Google
has tighter correlation

00:42:21.868 --> 00:42:24.634
between when pages
change on your site

00:42:24.634 --> 00:42:26.300
and when we know
pages change on your site.

00:42:26.300 --> 00:42:29.501
So, that puts us in a situation
where we can, over time,

00:42:29.501 --> 00:42:35.033
learn better page-change rates
than we can right now.

00:42:35.033 --> 00:42:37.834
So, from a practical
perspective, it won't help you

00:42:37.834 --> 00:42:41.167
get those pages indexed faster
right today,

00:42:41.167 --> 00:42:44.701
but it puts us on a path where
we can do that in the future.

00:42:44.701 --> 00:42:47.868
man:
Thank you.

00:42:47.868 --> 00:42:48.868
Jordan:
Hi, Monica.

00:42:48.868 --> 00:42:50.400
Monica:
Hello.

00:42:50.400 --> 00:42:54.434
So, I love the support
for Microdata.

00:42:54.434 --> 00:42:58.067
I was wondering if Google
would consider ever supporting

00:42:58.067 --> 00:43:02.200
the Open Graph Vocabulary
with Microdata

00:43:02.200 --> 00:43:05.701
and, in general, if you're
going to be supporting

00:43:05.701 --> 00:43:08.167
the Open Graph Protocol
via Meta Tags at all

00:43:08.167 --> 00:43:11.000
for this Rich Snippets.

00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:12.501
Jordan:
Go for it.

00:43:12.501 --> 00:43:14.067
Daniel:
Yeah, so Open Graph Protocol

00:43:14.067 --> 00:43:16.534
is a type of RDFa.

00:43:16.534 --> 00:43:18.133
It is a subset of RDFa,

00:43:18.133 --> 00:43:21.534
so from a markup
language perspective,

00:43:21.534 --> 00:43:23.734
there's really no barrier.

00:43:23.734 --> 00:43:30.601
One of the--the deal,
as Timothy described it,

00:43:30.601 --> 00:43:35.000
for Rich Snippets is a site
describes what their site

00:43:35.000 --> 00:43:37.200
is about in more detail,

00:43:37.200 --> 00:43:41.567
and in exchange, the site
gets richer results in Search.

00:43:41.567 --> 00:43:43.300
So, right now
Open Graph Protocol

00:43:43.300 --> 00:43:48.100
is not ideal for expressing
what a site is actually about.

00:43:48.100 --> 00:43:52.501
It's very UI driven,
with the exception of locations

00:43:52.501 --> 00:43:55.734
and the new effort
in products.

00:43:55.734 --> 00:43:58.434
It's really focused on,
here's an image,

00:43:58.434 --> 00:44:01.300
here's a title, here's
a description, here's a URL.

00:44:01.300 --> 00:44:08.067
And we've found, over time,
that that doesn't--

00:44:08.067 --> 00:44:12.067
communicating with users
in a search engine at that level

00:44:12.067 --> 00:44:16.300
doesn't help people make
decisions of what to click on

00:44:16.300 --> 00:44:17.767
on the search results page.

00:44:17.767 --> 00:44:20.901
I think that makes a lot of
sense for the stream,

00:44:20.901 --> 00:44:23.167
but makes less sense
on a search results page.

00:44:23.167 --> 00:44:26.467
On a search results page,
having richer information

00:44:26.467 --> 00:44:30.434
about, for instance,
ratings, for instance,

00:44:30.434 --> 00:44:36.467
what--the specifics that
are encoded in a prayer time

00:44:36.467 --> 00:44:38.200
is much more useful.

00:44:38.200 --> 00:44:42.667
And, so, we haven't seen
that benefit right now,

00:44:42.667 --> 00:44:44.167
but we're constantly
looking, right?

00:44:44.167 --> 00:44:46.200
And there are
a significant number of pages

00:44:46.200 --> 00:44:48.767
with Open Graph Markup,
so there's a lot to look at.

00:44:48.767 --> 00:44:51.968
Monica: Okay, great,
thank you.

00:44:51.968 --> 00:44:53.234
man:
So, Google tends to put

00:44:53.234 --> 00:44:55.667
less emphasis
on invisible markup,

00:44:55.667 --> 00:44:57.601
things that are like
in Meta Tags and the Head.

00:44:57.601 --> 00:45:01.701
Yet Rich Snippets supports
things like Meta Elements

00:45:01.701 --> 00:45:04.167
inside of your item.

00:45:04.167 --> 00:45:07.934
So, I'm wondering, how do you
view a span versus a meta,

00:45:07.934 --> 00:45:11.033
for example, if you're
to describe your data,

00:45:11.033 --> 00:45:13.334
and things that might not be
very useful to the visitor

00:45:13.334 --> 00:45:15.000
of your page,
like the Geo coordinates

00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:16.767
or the war field,
in your example,

00:45:16.767 --> 00:45:19.767
but could be interesting
in your Rich Snippet data?

00:45:19.767 --> 00:45:22.000
So, how do you weigh
those decisions

00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:25.634
and whether it just isn't ranked
that highly when you view it

00:45:25.634 --> 00:45:27.901
and try to get information

00:45:27.901 --> 00:45:31.501
versus what's not really useful
to a visitor?

00:45:31.501 --> 00:45:32.934
Jordan: So, I'll take
a hack into that,

00:45:32.934 --> 00:45:34.334
and then I'm sure
Daniel will add--

00:45:34.334 --> 00:45:36.767
is that when you
look at a page,

00:45:36.767 --> 00:45:40.000
the stuff that the user sees
is generally a better indication

00:45:40.000 --> 00:45:42.534
of what that page is about
to that user,

00:45:42.534 --> 00:45:45.367
and so, in general,
we encourage Rich Snippets

00:45:45.367 --> 00:45:49.534
to mark up data that is,
in fact, visible to the user.

00:45:49.534 --> 00:45:52.634
Daniel: Yeah,
I would only add that,

00:45:52.634 --> 00:45:55.100
as you mentioned, in the case
of, say, Geo coordinates,

00:45:55.100 --> 00:45:58.968
there are some cases where
that doesn't apply so well.

00:45:58.968 --> 00:46:01.501
Yeah, so we look
at the information

00:46:01.501 --> 00:46:02.767
that's on a Meta Tag,

00:46:02.767 --> 00:46:07.300
but we really encourage it
to mark up the content

00:46:07.300 --> 00:46:11.567
that the viewer sees.

00:46:11.567 --> 00:46:13.133
Jordan:
Cool.

00:46:13.133 --> 00:46:14.934
Well, I guess we got no more
questions for the microphones.

00:46:14.934 --> 00:46:16.033
We'll go ahead and end here.

00:46:16.033 --> 00:46:17.901
And I know I,
and I think Daniel,

00:46:17.901 --> 00:46:19.067
will be around
for a little bit longer,

00:46:19.067 --> 00:46:20.734
if you have any questions
for us directly.

00:46:20.734 --> 00:46:22.667
Thank you so much.
