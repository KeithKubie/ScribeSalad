00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:03.521
- [Narrator] An isotope
contains 16 protons,

00:00:03.521 --> 00:00:07.660
18 electrons, and 16 neutrons.

00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:11.398
What is the identity of the isotope?

00:00:11.398 --> 00:00:13.427
And I encourage you to
pause the video and see

00:00:13.427 --> 00:00:15.958
if you can figure it out
and I'll give you a hint,

00:00:15.958 --> 00:00:19.676
you might want to use
this periodic table here.

00:00:19.676 --> 00:00:22.216
All right, so I'm assuming
you've had a go at it.

00:00:22.216 --> 00:00:26.453
So, an element is defined by the number

00:00:26.453 --> 00:00:28.044
of protons it has.

00:00:28.044 --> 00:00:30.093
So if someone tells you
the number of protons, you

00:00:30.093 --> 00:00:31.933
should be able to look at
a periodic table and figure

00:00:31.933 --> 00:00:34.321
out what element they are talking about.

00:00:34.321 --> 00:00:38.484
So, because it is 16
protons, well we can go

00:00:38.484 --> 00:00:42.455
right over here to the atomic
number, what has 16 protons,

00:00:42.455 --> 00:00:46.156
well anything that has 16
protons by definition is going

00:00:46.156 --> 00:00:48.774
to be sulfur right over here.

00:00:48.774 --> 00:00:51.656
So I could write a big S.

00:00:51.656 --> 00:00:54.355
Now, the next thing we
might want to think about

00:00:54.355 --> 00:00:58.073
is the mass number of
this particular isotope.

00:00:58.073 --> 00:01:01.675
Remember, an isotope, all
sulfur atoms are going

00:01:01.675 --> 00:01:04.074
to have 16 protons, but
they might have different

00:01:04.074 --> 00:01:05.495
numbers of neutrons.

00:01:05.495 --> 00:01:07.953
So, the sulfurs that have
different number of neutrons,

00:01:07.953 --> 00:01:10.464
those would be different isotopes.

00:01:10.464 --> 00:01:13.944
So, this case we have
16 protons and we have

00:01:13.944 --> 00:01:18.266
16 neutrons, so if you add
the protons plus the neutrons

00:01:18.266 --> 00:01:21.557
together, you're going
to get your mass number.

00:01:21.557 --> 00:01:25.719
So 16 plus 16 is 32.

00:01:25.719 --> 00:01:29.271
Now let's figure out if there's
going to be any charge here.

00:01:29.271 --> 00:01:31.947
Well, the protons have a positive charge.

00:01:31.947 --> 00:01:33.979
The electrons have a negative charge.

00:01:33.979 --> 00:01:36.789
If you have an equal amount
of protons and electrons,

00:01:36.789 --> 00:01:38.689
then you would have no charge.

00:01:38.689 --> 00:01:40.979
But in this case, we have
a surplus of electrons.

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:44.630
We have two more electrons
than protons and since

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:48.900
we have a surplus of the
negative charged particles

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:52.131
we, and we have two
more, we're going to have

00:01:52.131 --> 00:01:56.310
a negative two charge and
we write that as two minus.

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:59.939
So this is actually an
ion, it has a charge.

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:03.410
So this is the isotope
of sulfur that has a mass

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:06.838
number of 32, the protons
plus the neutrons are 32,

00:02:06.838 --> 00:02:09.609
and it has two more electrons
than protons which gives

00:02:09.609 --> 00:02:11.737
it this negative charge.

00:02:11.737 --> 00:02:16.265
Let's do another example
where we go the other way.

00:02:16.265 --> 00:02:20.682
Where we are told, we are
given some information

00:02:20.682 --> 00:02:23.303
about what isotope and
really what ion we're

00:02:23.303 --> 00:02:25.784
dealing with because this
has a negative charge

00:02:25.784 --> 00:02:28.553
and we need to figure out
the protons, electrons,

00:02:28.553 --> 00:02:29.694
and neutrons.

00:02:29.694 --> 00:02:31.693
Well, the first thing that
I would say is, well look,

00:02:31.693 --> 00:02:33.882
they tell us that this is fluorine.

00:02:33.882 --> 00:02:36.621
As soon as you know what
element we're dealing with,

00:02:36.621 --> 00:02:38.721
you know what it's atomic
number is when you look

00:02:38.721 --> 00:02:40.843
at the periodic table and
you can figure out the number

00:02:40.843 --> 00:02:41.676
of protons.

00:02:41.676 --> 00:02:43.780
Remember, your atomic number
is the number of protons

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:45.783
and that's what defines the element.

00:02:45.783 --> 00:02:48.191
That's what makes this one fluorine.

00:02:48.191 --> 00:02:51.785
So let's go up to the, our periodic table

00:02:51.785 --> 00:02:55.851
and we see fluorine right
over here has an atomic

00:02:55.851 --> 00:02:57.691
number of nine.

00:02:57.691 --> 00:03:02.071
That means any fluorine has nine protons.

00:03:02.071 --> 00:03:04.321
So, let's scroll back down.

00:03:05.159 --> 00:03:07.687
So, must because it is
fluorine, we know we have

00:03:07.687 --> 00:03:09.417
nine protons.

00:03:09.417 --> 00:03:11.407
Now what else can we figure out?

00:03:11.407 --> 00:03:14.119
Well, we know we have a
negative charge right here

00:03:14.119 --> 00:03:17.469
and this is, you can use
as a negative one charge

00:03:17.469 --> 00:03:21.468
and so we have one more
electron than we have protons.

00:03:21.468 --> 00:03:24.458
And so since we have nine
protons, we're going to have

00:03:24.458 --> 00:03:25.680
10 electrons.

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:27.747
And then finally how many neutrons?

00:03:27.747 --> 00:03:30.657
Well, remember, the
neutrons plus the protons

00:03:30.657 --> 00:03:33.270
add up to give us this mass number.

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:35.627
So, if you have nine protons,
well how many neutrons

00:03:35.627 --> 00:03:38.028
do you have to add to
that to get to 18, well

00:03:38.028 --> 00:03:39.960
you're going to have
to have nine neutrons.

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:42.710
Nine plus nine is 18.
