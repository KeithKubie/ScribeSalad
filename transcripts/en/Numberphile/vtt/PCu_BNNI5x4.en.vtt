00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:05.050
So today I want to try
and bend your brains

00:00:05.050 --> 00:00:06.510
a little bit today.

00:00:06.510 --> 00:00:10.570
And I'm hoping it will cause a
little bit of debate on the

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:13.265
comments, because I know
YouTube's the home of rational

00:00:13.265 --> 00:00:14.890
and informed debate.

00:00:14.890 --> 00:00:16.309
So I look forward to that.

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:19.330
The question is what
is this equal to?

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:20.960
It's quite a simple sum.

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:22.325
It starts with 1.

00:00:22.325 --> 00:00:23.960
Then I'm going to subtract 1.

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:28.700
Then I'm going to add 1 again,
then subtract 1, then add 1,

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:31.950
then subtract 1, then add
1, then subtract 1.

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:33.650
And I'm going to do
this forever.

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:36.120
You get the idea of
that, I hope.

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:38.500
So what does that equal to?

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:41.320
So one of the answers that it
might be is if I put the

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:44.900
brackets like this--

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:50.310
here and here and
here and here--

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:55.360
you can see each bracket is
1 minus 1 plus 1 minus 1

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:56.320
plus 1 minus 1.

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:58.260
Each bracket is 0.

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:02.680
So you're getting 0 plus 0
plus 0 plus 0 forever.

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:04.849
So that's going to be equal
to 0, isn't it?

00:01:04.849 --> 00:01:06.120
That's one of the answers
it could be.

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:07.730
The problem is there
is another answer.

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:14.650
If I do it again, we could put
the brackets here, like this.

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:17.750
Now let's say this is--

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:21.400
plus again there plus
this bracket.

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:26.570
So I started with 1 plus minus
1 plus 1-- that's a 0--

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:28.030
plus minus 1 plus 1.

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:29.050
That's a 0.

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:30.050
Et cetera, et cetera.

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:31.360
All the brackets are 0.

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:33.100
So all the brackets
add up to 0.

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:35.320
But I've got a 1 at the start.

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:37.140
So now this is equal to 1.

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:38.970
I've got two answers.

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:41.170
I've got 0 if I put
the brackets here.

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:46.080
I've got 1 if I put brackets
in a different place.

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:48.550
There is a third answer
as well, and this is

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:49.760
the very weird one.

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:53.550
Let's say it has a number, so
let's call it S. We're going

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:55.090
to try and find out what
S is equal to.

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:56.070
That's what we want to know.

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:01.160
Let's do 1 minus S. So it's
1 minus this infinite sum.

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:02.430
Let's do that.

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:04.320
So let's write it out.

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:08.270
Plus 1 minus 1 plus
1 minus 1--

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.940
right.

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:12.380
If we take the bracket away,
this minus number will mean

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:17.280
that all the signs will get
flipped, so you'll get 1 minus

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:24.740
1 plus 1 minus 1
plus 1 minus 1.

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:26.930
That's what happens when I
take away the bracket.

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:30.600
But what I end up with is the
thing I started with.

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:34.990
That's just the alternating
plus and minus 1.

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:36.190
So I've got S again.

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:39.750
So I've got 1 minus S is
equal to S. That's OK.

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:40.350
That's fine.

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:41.530
You can solve that.

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:45.050
In other words, if I take the S
to the other side, I've got

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:48.550
2S equals 1, which then
you can see that

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:51.136
S is equal to 1/2.

00:02:51.136 --> 00:02:53.220
That's a weird answer.

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:54.610
I've got a 1/2.

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:56.840
The sum of adding
plus and minus 1

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:59.800
forever give you a 1/2.

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:00.810
Well, it might be 1.

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:01.620
It might be 0.

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:02.960
But it might be a 1/2.

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:06.190
So the guy who came up with
this idea was an Italian

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:07.370
mathematician called Grandi.

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:09.620
He did this in 1703.

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:10.350
He was a monk.

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:10.990
He was a mathematician.

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:13.450
He was one of those types.

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:15.060
And he published this.

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:17.140
And he said this is weird.

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:17.870
It's 0.

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:18.450
It's 1.

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:19.090
It's 1/2.

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:20.480
What's that all about?

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:22.870
And the mathematical community
had a look at it.

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:25.280
And they said well, it
can't be 1/2, can it?

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:27.100
I mean, you've got 1s and 0s.

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:28.020
That's madness.

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:28.990
It's can't be.

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:29.370
Oh.

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:30.020
Hang on.

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:32.040
Oh, that's actually
quite convincing.

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:33.050
It might be 1/2.

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:35.670
So there was a debate about
this for a long time--

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:36.880
I think 150 years--

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:42.820
quite a debate until the 19th
century, when all this stuff

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:45.560
with infinite sums really
got sorted out.

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:50.320
A lot of people think that
the best answer is 1/2.

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:52.620
I want to try and show you
why they think the

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:53.700
best answer is 1/2.

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:56.460
And then the one after that, I'm
going to show you one more

00:03:56.460 --> 00:03:59.440
thing to completely
bend your brain.

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:02.840
If we pick a nice infinite sum--
because there are nice

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:05.630
infinite sums, and there are bad
infinite sums-- one of the

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:07.820
nice ones is this.

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:14.240
1 plus 1/2 plus 1/4 plus
1/8 plus 1/16.

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:16.779
And the way you can work out
the answer for that--

00:04:16.779 --> 00:04:19.940
actually I'm going to show you
the proper way to do it.

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:23.480
The proper way to do is look
at the partial sums.

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:26.460
We're going to add this
sum term by term.

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:28.280
So let's just make a
sequence of them.

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:29.595
I start with 1.

00:04:29.595 --> 00:04:31.580
I'll write that down.

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:33.660
What do I get if I add
the first two terms?

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:35.400
It's 1 plus 1/2.

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:37.740
It's actually 3/2.

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:40.660
If you prefer, that's 1.5.

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:44.070
Let's add the first three
numbers together.

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:46.640
So 1/2 plus 1/4.

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:47.410
Let's do that.

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:48.820
7/4--

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:51.720
it's 1.75.

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:53.680
If I add the first
four together--

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:57.070
15 over 8, which is 1.875.

00:04:57.070 --> 00:05:01.350
And if you did the next lot,
you get 63 over 31--

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:05.280
1.96875.

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:06.960
You might be able to see,
they're getting closer and

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:09.520
closer to the value 2.

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:14.690
In general, if I picked one
in general, it would be 2

00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:17.320
minus 1 over n.

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:20.530
And if you can see, as the n
gets bigger, this gets tiny

00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:23.700
and disappears, and you're
just left with 2.

00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:26.380
And mathematicians are justified
in saying that the

00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:28.590
whole infinite sum
is equal to 2.

00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:31.260
If we try with Grandi's series,
it doesn't work.

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:33.330
Look at the partial sums.

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:34.840
The first one is 1.

00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:36.080
And you add the first
two together, you're

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:37.060
going to get 0.

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:39.810
You add the first three
together, you get 1 again.

00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:43.150
You add the first four together,
you get back to 0.

00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:45.490
And it keeps alternating
between 1s and 0s.

00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:47.670
And it's not getting
closer to a value.

00:05:47.670 --> 00:05:50.410
So this doesn't work with
Grandi's series.

00:05:50.410 --> 00:05:51.610
So I'm going to show
you a second

00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:53.680
method to work out sums.

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:56.420
I'm going to take the partial
sums, and I'm going to look at

00:05:56.420 --> 00:05:57.140
the averages.

00:05:57.140 --> 00:06:00.150
I'm just going to average
as I go along.

00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:00.790
Almost the same way.

00:06:00.790 --> 00:06:04.210
I'll do it with this one first
to show you the idea.

00:06:04.210 --> 00:06:06.690
Let's take the first one.

00:06:06.690 --> 00:06:07.520
That's 1.

00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:10.820
I'm going to add the first two
partial sums together.

00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:14.340
So 1 plus 1.5, but
I'll average it.

00:06:14.340 --> 00:06:16.000
I'm going to divide by 2.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:23.025
So it's going to be 1 plus 3/2
and then average it like that.

00:06:23.025 --> 00:06:28.110
Average is actually
equal to 5/4.

00:06:28.110 --> 00:06:31.910
If I took the first three and
averaged them, I would have 1

00:06:31.910 --> 00:06:37.790
plus 3/2 plus 7/4 divide by 3.

00:06:37.790 --> 00:06:41.570
And that gives me 17
over 12, and--

00:06:41.570 --> 00:06:43.780
well, hopefully, you get
the idea of that.

00:06:43.780 --> 00:06:46.800
Again, the numbers are tending
closer and closer to 2.

00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:49.260
It's just another method
to get the same answer.

00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:51.140
It gives me 2 again.

00:06:51.140 --> 00:06:55.000
In fact, in general, what you
get is 2 minus some junk.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:56.690
Oh, the joke isn't important.

00:06:56.690 --> 00:06:57.280
Look.

00:06:57.280 --> 00:06:58.210
It's junk.

00:06:58.210 --> 00:07:00.107
But this junk is
getting smaller

00:07:00.107 --> 00:07:01.220
and smaller and smaller.

00:07:01.220 --> 00:07:02.330
So you're getting 2 again.

00:07:02.330 --> 00:07:04.465
It's just another way to
find the same answer.

00:07:04.465 --> 00:07:08.600
But this method can be used
with Grandi's series.

00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:09.675
Let's try it.

00:07:09.675 --> 00:07:11.780
We're averaging the
partial sums.

00:07:11.780 --> 00:07:13.510
So those are the partial sums.

00:07:13.510 --> 00:07:14.650
We start with 1.

00:07:14.650 --> 00:07:18.490
Then if you average the first
two, you get 1 plus 0 divided

00:07:18.490 --> 00:07:21.630
by 2, which is 1/2.

00:07:21.630 --> 00:07:28.290
Take the first three, and then
divide by 3 gives me 2/3.

00:07:28.290 --> 00:07:30.330
I take the first four--

00:07:30.330 --> 00:07:33.840
1 plus 0 plus 1 plus 0--

00:07:33.840 --> 00:07:34.710
divide by 4.

00:07:34.710 --> 00:07:38.750
That's another 1/2 again,
if I get that right.

00:07:38.750 --> 00:07:41.720
Take the first five--

00:07:41.720 --> 00:07:44.280
so you might be able to see
what's going on, yeah--

00:07:44.280 --> 00:07:45.330
divide by 5.

00:07:45.330 --> 00:07:47.980
So that's 3/5.

00:07:47.980 --> 00:07:50.200
What happens is, in general,
you keep going.

00:07:50.200 --> 00:07:57.120
In general, you'll get 1/2
followed by something like 1/2

00:07:57.120 --> 00:07:58.170
plus 1 over 2n.

00:07:58.170 --> 00:07:59.080
There we go.

00:07:59.080 --> 00:08:01.340
Again, and so you get some junk
here that's going smaller

00:08:01.340 --> 00:08:03.560
and smaller and smaller.

00:08:03.560 --> 00:08:05.740
This is all tending
towards 1/2.

00:08:05.740 --> 00:08:10.690
So together you're zoning
in onto the number 1/2.

00:08:10.690 --> 00:08:13.400
So this is more technical than
the other version I did but

00:08:13.400 --> 00:08:15.790
it's a second way to get sums.

00:08:15.790 --> 00:08:17.810
You average the partial sums.

00:08:17.810 --> 00:08:19.160
But it works for Grandi's
series.

00:08:19.160 --> 00:08:19.870
It gives me 1/2.

00:08:19.870 --> 00:08:21.010
So what's going on?

00:08:21.010 --> 00:08:22.120
What's the difference?

00:08:22.120 --> 00:08:24.650
This second method-- it
gives you sums when

00:08:24.650 --> 00:08:27.550
there are sums to find.

00:08:27.550 --> 00:08:29.860
A limit is when you're
getting closer and

00:08:29.860 --> 00:08:31.820
closer to the value.

00:08:31.820 --> 00:08:34.419
Now Grandi's series does not
have a limit, because you're

00:08:34.419 --> 00:08:36.860
not getting closer and
closer to the value.

00:08:36.860 --> 00:08:39.850
But you have this second
way of finding a sum.

00:08:39.850 --> 00:08:42.830
It's almost like a limit, but
it's not really a limit.

00:08:42.830 --> 00:08:44.030
It's a fake limit.

00:08:44.030 --> 00:08:45.410
It's a pseudo limit.

00:08:45.410 --> 00:08:47.560
It has all the properties
of limits.

00:08:47.560 --> 00:08:49.730
It does all the same things.

00:08:49.730 --> 00:08:54.130
It's so close to being a limit,
that it turns up in

00:08:54.130 --> 00:08:58.050
calculations where you expect
limits to turn up.

00:08:58.050 --> 00:09:01.180
But the difference is you're not
getting closer and closer

00:09:01.180 --> 00:09:02.230
and closer.

00:09:02.230 --> 00:09:05.910
To really bend your brain,
try and imagine this.

00:09:05.910 --> 00:09:09.390
We're going to try to imagine
doing this in the real world.

00:09:09.390 --> 00:09:10.490
Imagine a light.

00:09:10.490 --> 00:09:12.380
We're going to turn the
light on and off.

00:09:12.380 --> 00:09:13.530
So you turn the light on.

00:09:13.530 --> 00:09:14.820
You turn the light off.

00:09:14.820 --> 00:09:17.600
Now every time, if I go along
Grandi's series, every time I

00:09:17.600 --> 00:09:20.270
see a 1, I turn the light on.

00:09:20.270 --> 00:09:23.145
Every time I see a minus 1,
I turn the light off.

00:09:23.145 --> 00:09:24.590
So you turn it on,
you turn it off.

00:09:24.590 --> 00:09:26.220
You turn it on, you
turn it off.

00:09:26.220 --> 00:09:30.430
The partial sums actually tell
you if the light is on or off.

00:09:30.430 --> 00:09:33.400
If you have a 1, that means
you just turned in on.

00:09:33.400 --> 00:09:36.700
If you have a 0, that means
you've just turned it off.

00:09:36.700 --> 00:09:38.780
You're going to start
an experiment.

00:09:38.780 --> 00:09:42.540
After one minute, you
turn the light on.

00:09:42.540 --> 00:09:46.510
After half a minute, you then
turn the light off again.

00:09:46.510 --> 00:09:49.560
After a quarter of a minute,
you turn the light on.

00:09:49.560 --> 00:09:51.735
After an 1/8 of a minute,
you turn the light off.

00:09:51.735 --> 00:09:53.500
And you're turning it on and
off, but you're doing it

00:09:53.500 --> 00:09:55.570
quicker and quicker
and quicker.

00:09:55.570 --> 00:09:57.720
So you're doing that infinitely
many times.

00:09:57.720 --> 00:10:01.640
But if we add up the time
together, 1 minute plus 1/2

00:10:01.640 --> 00:10:04.420
minute plus 1/4 of a minute
plus 1/8 of a minute--

00:10:04.420 --> 00:10:05.580
forever--

00:10:05.580 --> 00:10:08.190
adds up to 2 minutes.

00:10:08.190 --> 00:10:10.060
In fact, that's that
series I did there.

00:10:10.060 --> 00:10:12.860
If you remember the video we
did about Zero's Paradox,

00:10:12.860 --> 00:10:15.390
that's not just getting closer
to two minutes, you can

00:10:15.390 --> 00:10:17.420
actually compete it and
finish the whole

00:10:17.420 --> 00:10:20.320
process in two minutes.

00:10:20.320 --> 00:10:23.950
So in two minutes time, you'll
have turned on-- on and off--

00:10:23.950 --> 00:10:27.760
the light infinitely many
times and completed it.

00:10:27.760 --> 00:10:30.500
After two minutes, is
the light on or off?

00:10:33.220 --> 00:10:36.595
If Grandi's series is 0, that
means the light is off.

00:10:36.595 --> 00:10:40.780
If Grandi's series is 1, that
means the light is on.

00:10:40.780 --> 00:10:45.690
If Grandi's series is 1/2,
what does that mean?

00:10:45.690 --> 00:10:47.035
Is it 1/2 on, 1/2 off?

00:10:47.035 --> 00:10:49.426
Is it on and off at
the same time?

00:10:49.426 --> 00:10:52.510
What do you think?

00:10:52.510 --> 00:10:53.940
So he's given a head start.

00:10:53.940 --> 00:10:56.800
He's got 100 meter head start.

00:10:56.800 --> 00:10:58.490
And then they start the face.

00:10:58.490 --> 00:11:02.750
Now Achilles sprints 100 meters,
and he catches up to

00:11:02.750 --> 00:11:04.676
where the tortoise was.

00:11:04.676 --> 00:11:07.430
But in that time, the tortoise
has moved on.
