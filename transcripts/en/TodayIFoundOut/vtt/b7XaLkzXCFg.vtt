00:00:02.969 --> 00:00:14.670
The crown jewels are a collection of historic
and obscenely valuable relics closely associated

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:15.869
with the British monarchy.

00:00:15.869 --> 00:00:20.650
For centuries these golden, jewel-encrusted
trinkets have been kept under the watchful

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:23.580
eye of burly guards in the Tower of London.

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:29.529
And to doubly deter thieves, historically
the punishment for attempting to steal them

00:00:29.529 --> 00:00:34.280
was death… something Thomas Blood thumbed
his nose at when he waltzed right into the

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:37.550
Tower of London and tried to steal them in
1671.

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:42.300
A charismatic and likeable man who reportedly
had oodles of Irish charm and a razor sharp

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:47.400
wit, Blood was able to get close to the most
cherished symbols of the British monarch by

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:52.550
the oldest conman trick in the book- simply
befriending an individual who had full access

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:56.780
to them, the 77 year old Keeper of the Jewels,
Talbot Edwards.

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:00.930
Blood visited the Tower of London disguised
as a humble clergyman and buttered Edwards

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:05.220
up with compliments before instructing an
attractive female companion who was an actress

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:08.370
posing as his wife to feign a crippling stomach
ache.

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:13.030
Edwards being the gentlemanly sort, and having
his apartment just above the place where the

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:17.200
crown jewels were kept, immediately called
for his wife to tend to Blood’s companion,

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:22.040
which allowed the self-styled dashing rogue
to begin working his magic on the rest of

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:27.510
the Edwards’ clan, showering them with small
gifts in a faux display of gratitude for tending

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:28.530
to his wife.

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:32.520
Upon successfully integrating himself into
the Edwards family’s good graces, Blood

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:37.060
casually mentioned that he had a wealthy nephew
who was looking to marry, knowing full well

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:40.920
that Edwards had been looking for a sufficiently
well-off suitor for his daughter.

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:45.049
Edwards understandably jumped at the chance
to meet this mysterious nephew and arranged

00:01:45.049 --> 00:01:49.520
for a meeting- a meeting that Blood just so
happened to come to with not only his nephew

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:55.200
(who was actually his son), but also three
other companions, Robert Perrot, Richard Halliwell,

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:56.560
and William Smith.

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:01.400
As for these, when the group arrived at the
Tower of London on morning of May 9, 1671,

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:06.270
Smith was selected to wait outside the gates
with the horses while the others proceeded

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:07.870
to the Edwards’ abode.

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:11.849
While the group waited for Edwards’ wife
to prepare food, Blood casually asked if Edwards

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:14.910
would take them to go see the famed Crown
Jewels.

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:19.150
It should be noted here that part of Edwards’
job was in fact to show people who paid a

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:22.940
fee the jewels, so this was nothing terribly
out of the ordinary.

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:28.220
Thus, happy to oblige his new clergyman friend,
the elderly Keeper of the Jewels, said yes

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:32.870
and led the men downstairs to the room where
the Crown Jewels were stored.

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:37.610
As soon as the door to the room was unlocked,
Blood dropped his facade and the group roughly

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:41.160
beat Edwards and then stabbed him in the stomach
for good measure.

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:45.310
Once Edwards was subdued and gagged, Halliwell
went to serve as a lookout while Blood, the

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:49.390
son of a prominent and relatively wealthy
blacksmith, grabbed the crown and, using a

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:54.319
previously concealed mallet, quickly hammered
it flat in order to make it easy to conceal.

00:02:54.319 --> 00:02:58.950
While he was doing that, Perrot unceremoniously
shoved the Sovereign Orb, symbolising the

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:01.980
might of the British empire, into his pants….

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:06.050
While all this was happening, Blood’s son
attempted to cut the Royal Sceptre in two

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:11.610
as it was too big to similarly conceal otherwise,
even for the most boastful of men.

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:15.420
Unfortunately for them, Halliwell alerted
the three that Edwards’ son had arrived

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:17.569
home and was looking for his father.

00:03:17.569 --> 00:03:21.370
From here, it would appear the three decided
to flee without the sceptre a mere moment

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:22.959
before Edward’s son arrived.

00:03:22.959 --> 00:03:27.370
A newsletter clipping written later that day
by one Mr. Kirke, then stated,

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:31.629
Mr Edward’s son coming in and finding that
his father had been hurt ran after [them].

00:03:31.629 --> 00:03:35.900
One of the villains shot at him but missed,
as were the guards but they kept up with them

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:40.730
and captured two near the Iron Gate, old Blood
who was disguised as a priest called Ailoffe

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:42.800
and one called Perrott.

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:46.489
Afterwards Blood’s son [was captured] when
he fell from his horse near Gravel Lane, he

00:03:46.489 --> 00:03:49.890
was named Hunt and was the person who had
kidnapped the Duke of Ormonde.

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:53.660
They were brought to Whitehall and taken into
custody, the other two escaped.

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:57.409
(And just a side note here to wrap up the
Keeper of the Jewels’ tale, he survived

00:03:57.409 --> 00:03:59.209
this ordeal, despite his old age, the beating,
and being stabbed in the stomach.

00:03:59.209 --> 00:04:04.090
King Charles II would also give him a small
stipend in reparation for his injuries suffered

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:05.650
in service to the crown.)

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:10.000
Upon being arrested, Blood, a somewhat prominent
fellow already owing to his exploits during

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.989
the English Civil War (including afterwards
twice trying to kill the Duke of Ormonde,

00:04:13.989 --> 00:04:18.060
James Butler, and supposedly even making an
attempt on the King’s life), among other

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:23.130
escapades, refused to speak to anyone but
King Charles II himself about the events surrounding

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:24.169
his attempted robbery.

00:04:24.169 --> 00:04:28.350
Amazingly, the King agreed to meet with Blood,
who we should probably mention already had

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:32.870
a bounty of one thousand pounds on his head
owing to his previous exploits unconnected

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:34.520
to this particular robbery.

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:39.639
During the meeting, Blood used every ounce
of his charm to amuse and ingratiate the King

00:04:39.639 --> 00:04:44.910
and the others present, including The Duke
of York and various members of the royal family….

00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:46.639
It worked.

00:04:46.639 --> 00:04:50.250
After reportedly thoroughly entertaining the
King with the daring tale of the robbery,

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:54.720
the stories of the many adventures Blood had
had over his life, and throwing in a bit of

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:58.150
flattery, including telling the King he once
almost murdered him while the King was bathing

00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:02.110
in the Thames, but stopped short when he witnessed
the King’s majesty, the King gave him a

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:03.110
full pardon.

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:06.720
And not just for this crime, but also for
any crimes Blood had committed between May

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:12.860
29, 1660 and the then present day of the pardon
proclamation, August 1, 1671.

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:17.030
Blood’s son and other captured companion
were likewise let go.

00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:18.810
The good outcome didn’t stop there for Blood.

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:22.639
You see, during the English Civil War, Blood
had for a time supported Charles I, but when

00:05:22.639 --> 00:05:25.710
the King appeared as if he would lose, Blood
switched sides.

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:30.880
Thus, when Charles I was ousted, Blood was
given an estate and made, ironically, a Justice

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:31.880
of the Peace.

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:35.750
However, when Charles II took over, this estate
was taken from Blood.

00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:38.449
What does this have to do with his present
circumstances?

00:05:38.449 --> 00:05:43.610
Well, not satisfied with just pardoning Blood,
King Charles II decided that in reparation

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:47.320
for Blood’s previously taken lands, the
King would give him an estate that provided

00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:49.550
an annual income of around £500.

00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:53.010
While it’s difficult to accurately translate
this amount to modern pounds, very loosely

00:05:53.010 --> 00:05:57.290
speaking today this would be about a million
pounds worth of labor, or around £70,000

00:05:57.290 --> 00:06:01.770
pounds (about $95,000) by value of the goods
one could buy.

00:06:01.770 --> 00:06:05.810
There are various hypothesis as to why the
King rewarded the rogue in this matter.

00:06:05.810 --> 00:06:09.889
One such speculation is that the whole affair
had been arranged by the Duke of Buckingham

00:06:09.889 --> 00:06:13.680
and that he may have pulled some strings to
get Blood and his companions off the hook

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:14.680
when they failed.

00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:17.660
(Buckingham would ultimately be something
of a patron of Blood.)

00:06:17.660 --> 00:06:21.600
Another is that the King himself was behind
the attempted theft as a way to raise funds

00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:22.600
for himself.

00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:26.910
Yet another, this one perhaps slightly more
plausible, is suggested by famed diarist John

00:06:26.910 --> 00:06:28.350
Evelyn,

00:06:28.350 --> 00:06:33.090
Some believed he became a spie of severall
parties, being well with the Sectaries and

00:06:33.090 --> 00:06:38.949
Enthusiasts, and did his Majesties services
that way, which none alive could do so well

00:06:38.949 --> 00:06:39.949
as he…

00:06:39.949 --> 00:06:44.090
In other words, perhaps in Blood the King
saw an intelligent, educated, charming, and

00:06:44.090 --> 00:06:48.390
well connected person (among both the nobility
and criminal sects) who didn’t mind getting

00:06:48.390 --> 00:06:52.889
his hands a little dirty to achieve an end,
so decided to pardon him and put him on a

00:06:52.889 --> 00:06:57.880
pension via the estate, with at that point
Blood functioning as something of a spy and

00:06:57.880 --> 00:06:59.620
political operative for the King.

00:06:59.620 --> 00:07:04.639
However, there is no hard evidence to support
any of these suppositions and it may well

00:07:04.639 --> 00:07:07.580
really be that he and his little escapade,
including the dashing way Blood described

00:07:07.580 --> 00:07:12.139
it, simply amused the King as was reported
in contemporary accounts of the affair.

00:07:12.139 --> 00:07:15.700
In that case, apparently the old adage of
“Crime Doesn’t Pay” doesn’t apply

00:07:15.700 --> 00:07:21.730
if the absolute ruler of wherever you live
happens to find the crime especially hilarious.

00:07:21.730 --> 00:07:25.780
Whatever the motivation, when Blood would
later die in 1680, not only would his body

00:07:25.780 --> 00:07:30.650
later be exhumed just to double check he hadn’t
faked his death, but his epitaph read:

00:07:30.650 --> 00:07:36.280
Here lies the man who boldly hath run through
More villainies than England ever knew;

00:07:36.280 --> 00:07:39.650
And ne’er to any friend he had was true.

00:07:39.650 --> 00:08:04.449
Here let him then by all unpitied lie,
And let’s rejoice his time was come 

00:08:04.449 --> 00:08:09.860
to die.
