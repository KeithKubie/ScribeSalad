00:00:00.670 --> 00:00:04.350
Which side is
perpendicular to side BC?

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:07.720
So BC is this line
segment right over here.

00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:10.350
And for another segment
to be perpendicular to it,

00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:12.640
perpendicular just means
that the two segments

00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:16.540
need to intersect at a right
angle, or at a 90-degree angle.

00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:21.640
And we see that BC intersects
AB at a 90-degree angle.

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:24.100
This symbol right over here
represents a 90-degree,

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:25.740
or a right angle.

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:28.670
So we just have to
find side AB or BA.

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:29.860
And that's right over here.

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:34.650
Side AB is perpendicular
to side BC.

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:37.530
Let's do a few more of these.

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:41.690
Put the triangles into
the correct categories,

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:42.940
so this right over here.

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:43.200
So let's see.

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:44.575
Let's think about
our categories.

00:00:44.575 --> 00:00:47.410
Right triangles-- so that means
it has a 90-degree angle in it.

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:50.590
Obtuse triangles-- that
means it has an angle larger

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:52.920
than 90 degrees in it.

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.810
Acute triangles-- that
means all three angles

00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:58.580
are less than 90 degrees.

00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:00.029
So this one has a
90-degree angle.

00:01:00.029 --> 00:01:01.570
It has a right angle
right over here.

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:04.349
So this is a right triangle.

00:01:04.349 --> 00:01:07.040
This one right over
here, all of these angles

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:10.960
are less than 90 degrees,
just eyeballing it.

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:13.030
So this is going to
be an acute-- that's

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:14.280
going to be an acute triangle.

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:17.080
I'll put it under acute
triangles right over there.

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:19.470
Then this one over here,
this angle up here,

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:22.630
this is-- and we can
assume that these actually

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:26.564
are drawn to scale, this is more
open than a 90-degree angle.

00:01:26.564 --> 00:01:28.230
This is an obtuse
angle right over here.

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:30.290
It's going to be
more than 90 degrees.

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:34.090
So this is an obtuse triangle.

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:38.030
Now, this one over here,
all of them seem acute.

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:40.280
None of them even seem
to be a right angle.

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:46.274
So I would put this again
into acute-- acute triangles.

00:01:46.274 --> 00:01:47.940
This one here clearly
has a right angle.

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:49.680
It's labeled as such.

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:51.600
So we'll throw it
right over here.

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.580
And then this one, this
angle right over here

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:54.740
is clearly even larger.

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:56.660
It has a larger measure
than a right angle.

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:59.170
So this angle right over
here is more than 90 degrees.

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:02.060
It's going to be
an obtuse angle.

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:07.770
So we will throw it into
obtuse-- obtuse triangles.

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:10.810
So we got two in each of these.

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:12.700
And let's check our answer.

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:14.580
We got it right.
