00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:03.337
So let's see if we can put
this to work in a quiz.

00:00:03.337 --> 00:00:06.193
Consider a cache with
a 32 byte block size and

00:00:06.193 --> 00:00:09.204
a processor that creates
16-bit addresses.

00:00:09.204 --> 00:00:14.280
If the address in binary is this,
there are 16-bits here, so if that

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:20.390
is the address, what is the block number
that corresponds to this address?

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:24.190
And what is the block offset that
corresponds to this address?

00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:27.487
You can put binary numbers here
because it's a lot easier that way.
