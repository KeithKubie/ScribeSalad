two it sort of its own thing you know in
 

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:04.879
two it sort of its own thing you know in
some ways a repeat season why this one

00:06:04.879 --> 00:06:04.889
some ways a repeat season why this one
 

00:06:04.889 --> 00:06:06.230

they do connect
 

00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:14.140
they do connect
more and it could because they're

00:06:14.140 --> 00:06:14.150
more and it could because they're
 

00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:16.060
more and it could because they're
playing them like right after each other

00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:16.070
