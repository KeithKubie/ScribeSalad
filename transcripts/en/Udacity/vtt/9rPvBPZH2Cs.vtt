So, you may recall that females have two X chromosomes and males have an

00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:08.780
X an and a Y. And that Y is inherited from father to son

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:13.970
and so a man inherited his wife and his dad, who inherited it from

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:18.480
his dad. So, we can use SNV's on the Y chromosome to trace paternal ancestry.
