00:00:00.657 --> 00:00:03.240
LAWRENCE CHANG: Hi, I'm Lawrence
Chang, Senior Product Manager

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:04.980
for App Indexing at Google.

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:08.050
In this session, I'm going to
give you an overview of the App

00:00:08.050 --> 00:00:10.710
Indexing API and how to use it.

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:13.130
Now app indexing is a
capability of Google Search that

00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:15.900
helps users find and access
content in native apps

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:17.710
just like websites.

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:19.400
For an app developer,
app indexing

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:22.450
provides you with an opportunity
to drive engagement of your app

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:23.580
through Google.

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:28.050
The App Indexing API extends
this opportunity even further.

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:29.900
First, while app
indexing provides you

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:32.960
ways to specify link mappings
through website markup and site

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:36.170
maps, the App Indexing API
provides a third option

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:38.090
that you can use to
specify app links.

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:41.430
In this case, through
apps themselves.

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:43.950
Second, while app indexing
adds app deep links

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:46.760
to search results,
the App Indexing API

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:49.700
adds app deep links to
query autocompletions.

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:52.040
The autocompletions are
personalized and shown

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:53.830
to users based on app
content that they've

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:55.930
engaged with before,
so it can help

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:59.050
users reengage with your app.

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:00.950
To get started with
the App Indexing API,

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:03.730
first your app needs to
support deep linking.

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:06.340
You can follow our guidelines
for how to do this.

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:09.120
Then we recommend you also
follow our general app indexing

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:10.810
guidelines as needed.

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:13.610
This includes connecting
your website to your app.

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:16.570
You can read more about
that in our developer guide.

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:18.140
After you've
completed these steps,

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:20.700
then start thinking about
the App Indexing API.

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.650
So let's get into
some more details.

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:25.390
First, you need to add Google
Play services to your app

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:26.870
if you haven't already.

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:28.940
To do this, add a
line to your manifest

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:31.490
file to get the right version
of Google Play services.

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:33.470
Then, if you're
using Android Studio,

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:36.140
you'll also need to add a
dependency in your build file.

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:38.860
Finally, get the latest
version of Google Play services

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:41.520
through the SDK Manager.

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:44.290
Then in your main activity
you import the app index

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:46.800
and app indexing link classes.

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:49.720
Next, you define a
global Google API client

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:52.490
and in onCreate
you instantiate it.

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:54.780
In onStart you
connect your client

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:57.350
and define both the app address
and the corresponding web

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:59.290
address of the page.

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:00.790
Now in this example
I'm showing you

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:02.440
the actual links of strings.

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:05.400
But in reality you would
likely programmatically create

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:08.310
these links with
variables and parameters.

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:10.870
Then, you define the
outbound links on the page,

00:02:10.870 --> 00:02:13.687
including both app
and web addresses.

00:02:13.687 --> 00:02:15.520
Now once you've defined
your outbound links,

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:17.430
you create app
indexing link objects

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:20.980
by providing the app address,
web address, and the view ID.

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:24.070
Then, you create a list
out of these links.

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:27.030
Next, define a title
for your current page.

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:31.020
This title is what users will
see in the autocompletion UI.

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:34.770
Now you're ready to call the
App Indexing API view method.

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:37.100
You provide as arguments
the Google API client,

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:40.580
the activity, the app link
title, web link, and list

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:43.280
of outbound links
you just created.

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:46.510
Finally, in onStop add a
call to the viewEnd method

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:48.800
and disconnect your client.

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:51.450
So to summarize, if you'd
like to get the most out

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:54.410
of app indexing, you should
start with adding the deep link

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:57.830
support in your app, then
follow our general app indexing

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:03.560
guidelines, and finally,
implement the App Indexing API.

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:05.700
For more information, see
our developer guidelines

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:07.650
right here.

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:08.760
I'm Lawrence Chang.

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:10.680
Thanks for watching.
