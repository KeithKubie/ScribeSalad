simple answer is the network is not to
be trusted and this has always been true

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420
be trusted and this has always been true
 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.780

00:06:29.930 --> 00:06:29.940
little harder so you can use if you just
 

00:06:29.940 --> 00:06:31.940
little harder so you can use if you just
use Java sockets you can basically just

00:06:31.940 --> 00:06:31.950
use Java sockets you can basically just
 

00:06:31.950 --> 00:06:34.190
use Java sockets you can basically just
wrap it with just use an ssl socket

00:06:34.190 --> 00:06:34.200
wrap it with just use an ssl socket
 

00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:36.590
wrap it with just use an ssl socket
instead there is one very very big

00:06:36.590 --> 00:06:36.600
instead there is one very very big
 

00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:37.140
instead there is one very very big
pitfall

00:06:37.140 --> 00:06:37.150
pitfall
 

00:06:37.150 --> 00:06:40.170
pitfall
you need to keep in mind is that unlike

00:06:40.170 --> 00:06:40.180
you need to keep in mind is that unlike
 

00:06:40.180 --> 00:06:42.570
you need to keep in mind is that unlike
what the HTTP clients do SSL socket does

00:06:42.570 --> 00:06:42.580
what the HTTP clients do SSL socket does
 

00:06:42.580 --> 00:06:44.280
what the HTTP clients do SSL socket does
not check that the host that you're

00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:44.290
not check that the host that you're
 

00:06:44.290 --> 00:06:45.990
not check that the host that you're
connecting to is the host you expected

00:06:45.990 --> 00:06:46.000
connecting to is the host you expected
 

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:48.420
connecting to is the host you expected
to connect to and this is something

00:06:48.420 --> 00:06:48.430
to connect to and this is something
 

00:06:48.430 --> 00:06:50.220
to connect to and this is something
really important if you don't do it your

00:06:50.220 --> 00:06:50.230
really important if you don't do it your
 

00:06:50.230 --> 00:06:52.440
really important if you don't do it your
connections are completely insecure and

00:06:52.440 --> 00:06:52.450
connections are completely insecure and
 

00:06:52.450 --> 00:06:54.630
connections are completely insecure and
I'll talk about more when I get to the

00:06:54.630 --> 00:06:54.640
I'll talk about more when I get to the
 

00:06:54.640 --> 00:06:57.000
I'll talk about more when I get to the
mistakes so here's some sample code the

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:57.010
mistakes so here's some sample code the
 

00:06:57.010 --> 00:07:00.660
mistakes so here's some sample code the
important bit is this hostname verifier

00:07:00.660 --> 00:07:00.670
important bit is this hostname verifier
 

00:07:00.670 --> 00:07:02.640
important bit is this hostname verifier

is probably the hard part for a lot of

00:07:10.110 --> 00:07:10.120
is probably the hard part for a lot of
 

00:07:10.120 --> 00:07:11.160
is probably the hard part for a lot of
you and unfortunately I'm gonna

00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:11.170
you and unfortunately I'm gonna
 

00:07:11.170 --> 00:07:13.770

basically skip over it because I have 45

00:07:13.770 --> 00:07:13.780
basically skip over it because I have 45
 

00:07:13.780 --> 00:07:16.770
basically skip over it because I have 45
minutes and this is a really big subject

00:07:16.770 --> 00:07:16.780
minutes and this is a really big subject
 

00:07:16.780 --> 00:07:18.930
minutes and this is a really big subject
so if you're setting it up on your own

00:07:18.930 --> 00:07:18.940
so if you're setting it up on your own
 

00:07:18.940 --> 00:07:21.390
so if you're setting it up on your own
server SSL Labs has a really good best

00:07:21.390 --> 00:07:21.400
server SSL Labs has a really good best
 

00:07:21.400 --> 00:07:23.100
server SSL Labs has a really good best
practice for deployment document however

00:07:23.100 --> 00:07:23.110
practice for deployment document however
 

00:07:23.110 --> 00:07:25.110
practice for deployment document however
can you read it and generally if you're

00:07:25.110 --> 00:07:25.120
can you read it and generally if you're
 

00:07:25.120 --> 00:07:27.030
can you read it and generally if you're
just using some cloud service for your

00:07:27.030 --> 00:07:27.040
just using some cloud service for your

00:07:28.890 --> 00:07:28.900
back-end everybody has pretty good TLS
 

00:07:28.900 --> 00:07:33.990
back-end everybody has pretty good TLS
support nowadays so use it so okay so

00:07:33.990 --> 00:07:34.000
support nowadays so use it so okay so
 

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:35.820
support nowadays so use it so okay so
let's say you decide okay I really want

00:07:35.820 --> 00:07:35.830
let's say you decide okay I really want
 

00:07:35.830 --> 00:07:37.470
let's say you decide okay I really want
to use it I've gone through and I think

00:07:37.470 --> 00:07:37.480
to use it I've gone through and I think
 

00:07:37.480 --> 00:07:41.490
to use it I've gone through and I think
I've replaced all of those HTTP URLs of

00:07:41.490 --> 00:07:41.500
I've replaced all of those HTTP URLs of
 

00:07:41.500 --> 00:07:44.100
I've replaced all of those HTTP URLs of
HTTPS but how do I know that everything

00:07:44.100 --> 00:07:44.110
HTTPS but how do I know that everything
 

00:07:44.110 --> 00:07:46.770
HTTPS but how do I know that everything
that I'm sending is over a TLS

00:07:46.770 --> 00:07:46.780
that I'm sending is over a TLS
 

00:07:46.780 --> 00:07:48.390
that I'm sending is over a TLS
connection like how how can you be sure

00:07:48.390 --> 00:07:48.400
connection like how how can you be sure
 

00:07:48.400 --> 00:07:50.220
connection like how how can you be sure
it's always important to test especially

00:07:50.220 --> 00:07:50.230
it's always important to test especially
 

00:07:50.230 --> 00:07:52.620
it's always important to test especially
with security code you want to make sure

00:07:52.620 --> 00:07:52.630
with security code you want to make sure
 

00:07:52.630 --> 00:07:54.630
with security code you want to make sure
you're actually doing it right and so

00:07:54.630 --> 00:07:54.640
you're actually doing it right and so
 

00:07:54.640 --> 00:07:56.250
you're actually doing it right and so
why do you have to do this so let's

00:07:56.250 --> 00:07:56.260
why do you have to do this so let's
 

00:07:56.260 --> 00:07:58.050
why do you have to do this so let's
consider the most obvious case of source

00:07:58.050 --> 00:07:58.060
consider the most obvious case of source
 

00:07:58.060 --> 00:08:00.360
consider the most obvious case of source
code right I open just a static you know

00:08:00.360 --> 00:08:00.370
code right I open just a static you know
 

00:08:00.370 --> 00:08:03.240
code right I open just a static you know
htps example.com and I go there is this

00:08:03.240 --> 00:08:03.250
htps example.com and I go there is this
 

00:08:03.250 --> 00:08:05.730
htps example.com and I go there is this
over HTTPS yes

00:08:05.730 --> 00:08:05.740
over HTTPS yes
 

00:08:05.740 --> 00:08:06.960
over HTTPS yes
but it's actually more complicated than

00:08:06.960 --> 00:08:06.970
but it's actually more complicated than
 

00:08:06.970 --> 00:08:08.940
but it's actually more complicated than
you'd think because what if that page

00:08:08.940 --> 00:08:08.950
you'd think because what if that page
 

00:08:08.950 --> 00:08:10.890
you'd think because what if that page
immediately says actually the content is

00:08:10.890 --> 00:08:10.900
immediately says actually the content is
 

00:08:10.900 --> 00:08:14.610
immediately says actually the content is
over here on HTTP example.com so for the

00:08:14.610 --> 00:08:14.620
over here on HTTP example.com so for the
 

00:08:14.620 --> 00:08:16.500
over here on HTTP example.com so for the
HTTP URL connection in Android it

00:08:16.500 --> 00:08:16.510
HTTP URL connection in Android it
 

00:08:16.510 --> 00:08:18.000
HTTP URL connection in Android it
actually explicitly does not follow the

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:18.010
actually explicitly does not follow the
 

00:08:18.010 --> 00:08:19.650
actually explicitly does not follow the
redirects but if you're using a custom

00:08:19.650 --> 00:08:19.660
redirects but if you're using a custom
 

00:08:19.660 --> 00:08:21.230
redirects but if you're using a custom
client that might not be the case and

00:08:21.230 --> 00:08:21.240
client that might not be the case and
 

00:08:21.240 --> 00:08:24.180
client that might not be the case and
it's actually a little tricky but that's

00:08:24.180 --> 00:08:24.190
it's actually a little tricky but that's
 

00:08:24.190 --> 00:08:26.040
it's actually a little tricky but that's
not how you usually use URLs what you'll

00:08:26.040 --> 00:08:26.050
not how you usually use URLs what you'll
 

00:08:26.050 --> 00:08:27.540
not how you usually use URLs what you'll
often have is that you'll get them from

00:08:27.540 --> 00:08:27.550
often have is that you'll get them from
 

00:08:27.550 --> 00:08:29.490
often have is that you'll get them from
your server back-end so consider you

00:08:29.490 --> 00:08:29.500
your server back-end so consider you
 

00:08:29.500 --> 00:08:31.650
your server back-end so consider you
have you know a bunch of contacts that

00:08:31.650 --> 00:08:31.660
have you know a bunch of contacts that
 

00:08:31.660 --> 00:08:33.030
have you know a bunch of contacts that
your server pushes down and one of those

00:08:33.030 --> 00:08:33.040
your server pushes down and one of those
 

00:08:33.040 --> 00:08:35.250
your server pushes down and one of those
things is a profile picture your data is

00:08:35.250 --> 00:08:35.260
things is a profile picture your data is
 

00:08:35.260 --> 00:08:36.510
things is a profile picture your data is
basically gonna be like you know name

00:08:36.510 --> 00:08:36.520
basically gonna be like you know name
 

00:08:36.520 --> 00:08:38.910
basically gonna be like you know name
chad profile picture you know here's a

00:08:38.910 --> 00:08:38.920
chad profile picture you know here's a
 

00:08:38.920 --> 00:08:40.800
chad profile picture you know here's a
PNG on the internet somewhere and you're

00:08:40.800 --> 00:08:40.810
PNG on the internet somewhere and you're
 

00:08:40.810 --> 00:08:42.480
PNG on the internet somewhere and you're
just going to blindly open that URL and

00:08:42.480 --> 00:08:42.490
just going to blindly open that URL and
 

00:08:42.490 --> 00:08:44.460
just going to blindly open that URL and
this works great on android like whether

00:08:44.460 --> 00:08:44.470
this works great on android like whether
 

00:08:44.470 --> 00:08:46.470
this works great on android like whether
it's HTTP or HTTP your code just works

00:08:46.470 --> 00:08:46.480
it's HTTP or HTTP your code just works
 

00:08:46.480 --> 00:08:48.960
it's HTTP or HTTP your code just works
but what happens if you know today when

00:08:48.960 --> 00:08:48.970
but what happens if you know today when
 

00:08:48.970 --> 00:08:50.070
but what happens if you know today when
you ship your app it's a she

00:08:50.070 --> 00:08:50.080
you ship your app it's a she
 

00:08:50.080 --> 00:08:51.840
you ship your app it's a she
yes but then six months down the line

00:08:51.840 --> 00:08:51.850
yes but then six months down the line
 

00:08:51.850 --> 00:08:53.519
yes but then six months down the line
you're doing some tweaks on the back end

00:08:53.519 --> 00:08:53.529
you're doing some tweaks on the back end
 

00:08:53.529 --> 00:08:55.769
you're doing some tweaks on the back end
and you accidentally set those to http

00:08:55.769 --> 00:08:55.779
and you accidentally set those to http
 

00:08:55.779 --> 00:08:58.199
and you accidentally set those to http
and you don't realize like suddenly all

00:08:58.199 --> 00:08:58.209
and you don't realize like suddenly all
 

00:08:58.209 --> 00:08:59.400
and you don't realize like suddenly all
those security guarantees you were

00:08:59.400 --> 00:08:59.410
those security guarantees you were
 

00:08:59.410 --> 00:09:01.130
those security guarantees you were
trying to get are kind of out the window

00:09:01.130 --> 00:09:01.140
trying to get are kind of out the window
 

00:09:01.140 --> 00:09:04.139
trying to get are kind of out the window
and finally what about the third party

00:09:04.139 --> 00:09:04.149
and finally what about the third party
 

00:09:04.149 --> 00:09:05.639
and finally what about the third party
code in your application right you don't

00:09:05.639 --> 00:09:05.649
code in your application right you don't
 

00:09:05.649 --> 00:09:08.310
code in your application right you don't
want any of your traffic to go out over

00:09:08.310 --> 00:09:08.320
want any of your traffic to go out over
 

00:09:08.320 --> 00:09:09.810
want any of your traffic to go out over
non secure connections but what about

00:09:09.810 --> 00:09:09.820
non secure connections but what about
 

00:09:09.820 --> 00:09:11.490
non secure connections but what about
that ad or analytics library are you

00:09:11.490 --> 00:09:11.500
that ad or analytics library are you
 

00:09:11.500 --> 00:09:14.400
that ad or analytics library are you
downloaded do they do they respect that

00:09:14.400 --> 00:09:14.410
downloaded do they do they respect that
 

00:09:14.410 --> 00:09:18.840

how do you know I don't know so what do

00:09:18.840 --> 00:09:18.850
how do you know I don't know so what do
 

00:09:18.850 --> 00:09:19.170
how do you know I don't know so what do
you do

00:09:19.170 --> 00:09:19.180
you do
 

00:09:19.180 --> 00:09:21.509
you do
so in marshmallow we added a couple of

00:09:21.509 --> 00:09:21.519
so in marshmallow we added a couple of
 

00:09:21.519 --> 00:09:23.340
so in marshmallow we added a couple of
features to help you both in development

00:09:23.340 --> 00:09:23.350
features to help you both in development
 

00:09:23.350 --> 00:09:26.130
features to help you both in development
time and actually released on devices so

00:09:26.130 --> 00:09:26.140
time and actually released on devices so
 

00:09:26.140 --> 00:09:28.139
time and actually released on devices so
the first thing we have is some new

00:09:28.139 --> 00:09:28.149
the first thing we have is some new
 

00:09:28.149 --> 00:09:30.060
the first thing we have is some new
strict mode detection for clear text

00:09:30.060 --> 00:09:30.070
strict mode detection for clear text
 

00:09:30.070 --> 00:09:31.620
strict mode detection for clear text
traffic so while you're developing you

00:09:31.620 --> 00:09:31.630
traffic so while you're developing you
 

00:09:31.630 --> 00:09:34.170
traffic so while you're developing you
can detect stuff and also a manifest

00:09:34.170 --> 00:09:34.180
can detect stuff and also a manifest
 

00:09:34.180 --> 00:09:35.970
can detect stuff and also a manifest
flag that lets you specify whether or

while you're developing and use your

00:09:47.550 --> 00:09:47.560
while you're developing and use your
 

00:09:47.560 --> 00:09:49.079
while you're developing and use your
standard strict mode stuff to detect

00:09:49.079 --> 00:09:49.089
standard strict mode stuff to detect
 

00:09:49.089 --> 00:09:51.180

clear text traffic notify you crash the

00:09:51.180 --> 00:09:51.190
clear text traffic notify you crash the
 

00:09:51.190 --> 00:09:53.009
clear text traffic notify you crash the
app whatever that way as you're

00:09:53.009 --> 00:09:53.019
app whatever that way as you're
 

00:09:53.019 --> 00:09:54.449
app whatever that way as you're
developing you can find these issues and

00:09:54.449 --> 00:09:54.459
developing you can find these issues and
 

00:09:54.459 --> 00:09:56.460
developing you can find these issues and
the way the strict mode detection works

00:09:56.460 --> 00:09:56.470
the way the strict mode detection works
 

00:09:56.470 --> 00:09:58.579
the way the strict mode detection works
is it actually does packet inspection of

00:09:58.579 --> 00:09:58.589
is it actually does packet inspection of
 

00:09:58.589 --> 00:10:01.290
is it actually does packet inspection of
every single connection that leaves your

00:10:01.290 --> 00:10:01.300
every single connection that leaves your
 

00:10:01.300 --> 00:10:04.410
every single connection that leaves your
UID for your application and it checks

00:10:04.410 --> 00:10:04.420
UID for your application and it checks
 

00:10:04.420 --> 00:10:05.730
UID for your application and it checks
to make sure that the very first thing

00:10:05.730 --> 00:10:05.740
to make sure that the very first thing
 

00:10:05.740 --> 00:10:08.310
to make sure that the very first thing
it sends is a TLS client below basically

00:10:08.310 --> 00:10:08.320
it sends is a TLS client below basically
 

00:10:08.320 --> 00:10:10.110
it sends is a TLS client below basically
the start of that secure handshake and

00:10:10.110 --> 00:10:10.120
the start of that secure handshake and
 

00:10:10.120 --> 00:10:12.060
the start of that secure handshake and
that's good because it means that no

00:10:12.060 --> 00:10:12.070
that's good because it means that no
 

00:10:12.070 --> 00:10:13.500

custom written stuff it will detect
absolutely all of it the downside though

00:10:20.250 --> 00:10:20.260
absolutely all of it the downside though
 

00:10:20.260 --> 00:10:21.750
absolutely all of it the downside though
is that there are some false positive

00:10:21.750 --> 00:10:21.760
is that there are some false positive
 

00:10:21.760 --> 00:10:23.340
is that there are some false positive

secure but the very first thing you'll
 

00:10:33.550 --> 00:10:35.069
secure but the very first thing you'll
send is actually sort of a connect

actually I do a little bit of

00:10:42.540 --> 00:10:42.550
actually I do a little bit of
 

00:10:42.550 --> 00:10:44.639
actually I do a little bit of

that's great so the next side of things
 

00:10:59.079 --> 00:11:00.990
that's great so the next side of things

could do bad things with it so the

00:12:00.510 --> 00:12:00.520
could do bad things with it so the
 

00:12:00.520 --> 00:12:03.090
could do bad things with it so the
question I get quite a lot is why do you

00:12:03.090 --> 00:12:03.100
question I get quite a lot is why do you
 

00:12:03.100 --> 00:12:04.770
question I get quite a lot is why do you
block traffic instead of doing sort of

00:12:04.770 --> 00:12:04.780
block traffic instead of doing sort of
 

00:12:04.780 --> 00:12:08.460

transparent upgrading and there's a

00:12:08.460 --> 00:12:08.470
transparent upgrading and there's a
 

00:12:08.470 --> 00:12:09.330
transparent upgrading and there's a
couple reasons for this

00:12:09.330 --> 00:12:09.340
couple reasons for this
 

00:12:09.340 --> 00:12:11.100
couple reasons for this
so first of all if you do transparent

00:12:11.100 --> 00:12:11.110
so first of all if you do transparent
 

00:12:11.110 --> 00:12:12.870
so first of all if you do transparent
upgrading all of your older devices are

00:12:12.870 --> 00:12:12.880
upgrading all of your older devices are
 

00:12:12.880 --> 00:12:15.090
upgrading all of your older devices are
basically just kind of left out like

00:12:15.090 --> 00:12:15.100
basically just kind of left out like
 

00:12:15.100 --> 00:12:16.830
basically just kind of left out like
they're completely out of luck if you

00:12:16.830 --> 00:12:16.840
they're completely out of luck if you
 

00:12:16.840 --> 00:12:18.630
they're completely out of luck if you
only develop on a newer device you might

00:12:18.630 --> 00:12:18.640
only develop on a newer device you might
 

00:12:18.640 --> 00:12:20.580
only develop on a newer device you might
not even know that you're actually doing

00:12:20.580 --> 00:12:20.590
not even know that you're actually doing
 

00:12:20.590 --> 00:12:22.290
not even know that you're actually doing
these connections over HTTP like you

00:12:22.290 --> 00:12:22.300
these connections over HTTP like you
 

00:12:22.300 --> 00:12:23.490
these connections over HTTP like you
just see them ending up going out

00:12:23.490 --> 00:12:23.500
just see them ending up going out
 

00:12:23.500 --> 00:12:25.740
just see them ending up going out
securely and finally upgrade logic is

00:12:25.740 --> 00:12:25.750
securely and finally upgrade logic is
 

00:12:25.750 --> 00:12:30.270
securely and finally upgrade logic is
actually not it's it's a big pain so

00:12:30.270 --> 00:12:30.280
actually not it's it's a big pain so
 

00:12:30.280 --> 00:12:32.880
actually not it's it's a big pain so
first of all for non HTTP it might not

00:12:32.880 --> 00:12:32.890
first of all for non HTTP it might not
 

00:12:32.890 --> 00:12:34.680
first of all for non HTTP it might not
be obvious what the sort of upgrade path

00:12:34.680 --> 00:12:34.690
be obvious what the sort of upgrade path
 

00:12:34.690 --> 00:12:36.870
be obvious what the sort of upgrade path
is it might actually require like this

00:12:36.870 --> 00:12:36.880
is it might actually require like this
 

00:12:36.880 --> 00:12:39.140
is it might actually require like this
protocol is just completely not allowed

00:12:39.140 --> 00:12:39.150

00:12:39.150 --> 00:12:42.300
protocol is just completely not allowed
and also like just doing the standard

00:12:42.300 --> 00:12:42.310
and also like just doing the standard
 

00:12:42.310 --> 00:12:44.670
and also like just doing the standard
rewriting of HTTP HTTP might break your

00:12:44.670 --> 00:12:44.680
rewriting of HTTP HTTP might break your
 

00:12:44.680 --> 00:12:46.110
rewriting of HTTP HTTP might break your
connections like there's still a lot of

00:12:46.110 --> 00:12:46.120
connections like there's still a lot of
 

00:12:46.120 --> 00:12:48.330
connections like there's still a lot of
websites out there right now where if

00:12:48.330 --> 00:12:48.340

00:12:48.340 --> 00:12:49.950
websites out there right now where if
you connect them over HTTP the

00:12:49.950 --> 00:12:49.960
you connect them over HTTP the
 

00:12:49.960 --> 00:12:51.870
you connect them over HTTP the
connection works but like this

00:12:51.870 --> 00:12:51.880

noise so instead by blocking you'll know

00:12:59.130 --> 00:12:59.140
noise so instead by blocking you'll know
 

00:12:59.140 --> 00:13:01.200
noise so instead by blocking you'll know
immediately and you'll actually be able

00:13:01.200 --> 00:13:01.210
immediately and you'll actually be able
 

00:13:01.210 --> 00:13:03.900
immediately and you'll actually be able
to say oh okay I'm like you you know

00:13:03.900 --> 00:13:03.910
to say oh okay I'm like you you know
 

00:13:03.910 --> 00:13:05.430
to say oh okay I'm like you you know
you'll get the crash notification you'll

00:13:05.430 --> 00:13:05.440
you'll get the crash notification you'll
 

00:13:05.440 --> 00:13:07.140
you'll get the crash notification you'll
see oh crap this you know is now over

00:13:07.140 --> 00:13:07.150
see oh crap this you know is now over
 

00:13:07.150 --> 00:13:09.330
see oh crap this you know is now over
HTTP you can fix it and you can fix all

00:13:09.330 --> 00:13:09.340
HTTP you can fix it and you can fix all
 

00:13:09.340 --> 00:13:11.220
HTTP you can fix it and you can fix all
the devices not just the devices running

00:13:11.220 --> 00:13:11.230
the devices not just the devices running
 

00:13:11.230 --> 00:13:13.350
the devices not just the devices running
em and newer but absolutely every device

00:13:13.350 --> 00:13:13.360
em and newer but absolutely every device
 

00:13:13.360 --> 00:13:15.650
em and newer but absolutely every device
and that's a lot better

00:13:15.650 --> 00:13:15.660
and that's a lot better
 

00:13:15.660 --> 00:13:20.579
and that's a lot better
so it's water real quick so now my

00:13:20.579 --> 00:13:20.589
so it's water real quick so now my
 

00:13:20.589 --> 00:13:22.620
so it's water real quick so now my
favorite part because I'm a security

00:13:22.620 --> 00:13:22.630
favorite part because I'm a security
 

00:13:22.630 --> 00:13:24.360
favorite part because I'm a security
person are the various mistakes and

00:13:24.360 --> 00:13:24.370
person are the various mistakes and
 

00:13:24.370 --> 00:13:28.920
person are the various mistakes and
misconfigurations that people make so

00:13:28.920 --> 00:13:28.930
misconfigurations that people make so
 

00:13:28.930 --> 00:13:32.699
misconfigurations that people make so
how do you know that using TLS correctly

00:13:32.699 --> 00:13:32.709
how do you know that using TLS correctly
 

00:13:32.709 --> 00:13:34.470
how do you know that using TLS correctly
well the good news is is secure by

00:13:34.470 --> 00:13:34.480
well the good news is is secure by
 

00:13:34.480 --> 00:13:35.940
well the good news is is secure by
default on basically all modern

00:13:35.940 --> 00:13:35.950
default on basically all modern
 

00:13:35.950 --> 00:13:38.340
default on basically all modern
platforms so if you don't try and do

00:13:38.340 --> 00:13:38.350
platforms so if you don't try and do
 

00:13:38.350 --> 00:13:40.500
platforms so if you don't try and do
anything custom you are good to go

00:13:40.500 --> 00:13:40.510
anything custom you are good to go
 

00:13:40.510 --> 00:13:42.780
anything custom you are good to go
life is great you don't need to do

00:13:42.780 --> 00:13:42.790
life is great you don't need to do
 

00:13:42.790 --> 00:13:45.569
life is great you don't need to do
anything unfortunately it's possible to

00:13:45.569 --> 00:13:45.579
anything unfortunately it's possible to
 

00:13:45.579 --> 00:13:47.009
anything unfortunately it's possible to
override a lot of these defaults and

00:13:47.009 --> 00:13:47.019
override a lot of these defaults and
 

00:13:47.019 --> 00:13:49.560
override a lot of these defaults and
you'd like to hope that no one overrides

00:13:49.560 --> 00:13:49.570
you'd like to hope that no one overrides
 

00:13:49.570 --> 00:13:51.960
you'd like to hope that no one overrides
these with you know insecure code that

these with you know insecure code that
 

00:13:51.970 --> 00:13:53.400
these with you know insecure code that
it's always secure code that's well

00:13:53.400 --> 00:13:53.410
it's always secure code that's well
 

00:13:53.410 --> 00:13:55.949
it's always secure code that's well
thought out but that's really not often

00:13:55.949 --> 00:13:55.959
thought out but that's really not often
 

00:13:55.959 --> 00:13:58.860

the case and so throughout this whole

00:13:58.860 --> 00:13:58.870
the case and so throughout this whole
 

00:13:58.870 --> 00:14:00.360

thing I'm gonna be referencing a lot of
 

00:14:00.370 --> 00:14:02.009
thing I'm gonna be referencing a lot of
information that's also available on the

information that's also available on the
 

00:14:02.019 --> 00:14:04.829
information that's also available on the
security SSL training article it has

00:14:04.829 --> 00:14:04.839
security SSL training article it has
 

00:14:04.839 --> 00:14:06.569
security SSL training article it has
code samples for all this it has a lot

00:14:06.569 --> 00:14:06.579
code samples for all this it has a lot
 

00:14:06.579 --> 00:14:09.000

more words that I'm gonna go into and I

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:09.010
more words that I'm gonna go into and I
 

00:14:09.010 --> 00:14:10.470
more words that I'm gonna go into and I
highly recommend you read that if you're

00:14:10.470 --> 00:14:10.480
highly recommend you read that if you're
 

00:14:10.480 --> 00:14:12.329
highly recommend you read that if you're
ever doing TLS stuff please look at that

00:14:12.329 --> 00:14:12.339
ever doing TLS stuff please look at that
 

00:14:12.339 --> 00:14:14.790
ever doing TLS stuff please look at that
first because it's a better source than

00:14:14.790 --> 00:14:14.800
first because it's a better source than
 

00:14:14.800 --> 00:14:17.400
first because it's a better source than
most of the Internet so why do people

00:14:17.400 --> 00:14:17.410
most of the Internet so why do people
 

00:14:17.410 --> 00:14:19.800
most of the Internet so why do people
put in secure TLS code into their app

00:14:19.800 --> 00:14:19.810
put in secure TLS code into their app
 

00:14:19.810 --> 00:14:22.350
put in secure TLS code into their app
well the simple answer is that what

00:14:22.350 --> 00:14:22.360
well the simple answer is that what
 

00:14:22.360 --> 00:14:24.449
well the simple answer is that what
happens is someone has an issue they go

00:14:24.449 --> 00:14:24.459
happens is someone has an issue they go
 

00:14:24.459 --> 00:14:26.460
happens is someone has an issue they go
on a forum they post hey I have this

00:14:26.460 --> 00:14:26.470
on a forum they post hey I have this
 

00:14:26.470 --> 00:14:28.470
on a forum they post hey I have this
issue someone hands them a code sample

00:14:28.470 --> 00:14:28.480
issue someone hands them a code sample
 

00:14:28.480 --> 00:14:30.510
issue someone hands them a code sample
that says like yeah I just take this

00:14:30.510 --> 00:14:30.520
that says like yeah I just take this
 

00:14:30.520 --> 00:14:32.160
that says like yeah I just take this
this will fix your problem you know copy

00:14:32.160 --> 00:14:32.170
this will fix your problem you know copy
 

00:14:32.170 --> 00:14:33.780
this will fix your problem you know copy
and paste it into the app or run it you

00:14:33.780 --> 00:14:33.790
and paste it into the app or run it you
 

00:14:33.790 --> 00:14:36.269
and paste it into the app or run it you
know good ship it the problem is is that

00:14:36.269 --> 00:14:36.279
know good ship it the problem is is that
 

00:14:36.279 --> 00:14:39.690
know good ship it the problem is is that
most the code samples provided are bad

00:14:39.690 --> 00:14:39.700
most the code samples provided are bad
 

00:14:39.700 --> 00:14:41.280
most the code samples provided are bad
they fix the problem by basically

00:14:41.280 --> 00:14:41.290
they fix the problem by basically
 

00:14:41.290 --> 00:14:43.350
they fix the problem by basically
removing all the security so you'll

00:14:43.350 --> 00:14:43.360
removing all the security so you'll
 

00:14:43.360 --> 00:14:44.790
removing all the security so you'll
never see that security exception again

00:14:44.790 --> 00:14:44.800
never see that security exception again
 

00:14:44.800 --> 00:14:46.440
never see that security exception again
because you'll never see a security

00:14:46.440 --> 00:14:46.450
because you'll never see a security
 

00:14:46.450 --> 00:14:49.380
because you'll never see a security
exception and that's not what you want

00:14:49.380 --> 00:14:49.390
exception and that's not what you want
 

00:14:49.390 --> 00:14:51.750
exception and that's not what you want
so before I kind of go into these I'm

00:14:51.750 --> 00:14:51.760
so before I kind of go into these I'm
 

00:14:51.760 --> 00:14:53.250
so before I kind of go into these I'm
gonna go into slightly more detail about

00:14:53.250 --> 00:14:53.260
gonna go into slightly more detail about
 

00:14:53.260 --> 00:14:55.170
gonna go into slightly more detail about
what checking trust and TLS actually is

00:14:55.170 --> 00:14:55.180
what checking trust and TLS actually is
 

00:14:55.180 --> 00:14:57.600
what checking trust and TLS actually is
I'm gonna skip over most of it because

00:14:57.600 --> 00:14:57.610
I'm gonna skip over most of it because
 

00:14:57.610 --> 00:14:59.310
I'm gonna skip over most of it because
it's really in-depth and I don't think

00:14:59.310 --> 00:14:59.320
it's really in-depth and I don't think
 

00:14:59.320 --> 00:15:00.630
it's really in-depth and I don't think
you need to know most of it for the

00:15:00.630 --> 00:15:00.640
you need to know most of it for the
 

00:15:00.640 --> 00:15:02.550
you need to know most of it for the
context of this if you want to you can

00:15:02.550 --> 00:15:02.560
context of this if you want to you can
 

00:15:02.560 --> 00:15:05.730
context of this if you want to you can
go read an RFC have fun with that so

00:15:05.730 --> 00:15:05.740
go read an RFC have fun with that so
 

00:15:05.740 --> 00:15:08.610
go read an RFC have fun with that so
there's there's two big parts about TLS

00:15:08.610 --> 00:15:08.620
there's there's two big parts about TLS
 

00:15:08.620 --> 00:15:09.689
there's there's two big parts about TLS
trust checking at a very high level

00:15:09.689 --> 00:15:09.699
trust checking at a very high level
 

00:15:09.699 --> 00:15:11.100
trust checking at a very high level
first of all that the person you're

00:15:11.100 --> 00:15:11.110
first of all that the person you're
 

00:15:11.110 --> 00:15:12.689
first of all that the person you're
talking to is the person you intended to

00:15:12.689 --> 00:15:12.699
talking to is the person you intended to
 

00:15:12.699 --> 00:15:15.660
talking to is the person you intended to
talk to and that they they have a

00:15:15.660 --> 00:15:15.670
talk to and that they they have a
 

00:15:15.670 --> 00:15:17.370
talk to and that they they have a
trusted certificate saying they're that

00:15:17.370 --> 00:15:17.380
trusted certificate saying they're that
 

00:15:17.380 --> 00:15:18.960
trusted certificate saying they're that
person and these are slightly different

00:15:18.960 --> 00:15:18.970
person and these are slightly different
 

00:15:18.970 --> 00:15:21.180
person and these are slightly different
so for example like I can go and I

00:15:21.180 --> 00:15:21.190
so for example like I can go and I
 

00:15:21.190 --> 00:15:23.220
so for example like I can go and I
register evil calm I can go by a

00:15:23.220 --> 00:15:23.230
register evil calm I can go by a
 

00:15:23.230 --> 00:15:25.019
register evil calm I can go by a
certificate for that because I own it

00:15:25.019 --> 00:15:25.029
certificate for that because I own it
 

00:15:25.029 --> 00:15:27.420
certificate for that because I own it
and that's all fine but that doesn't

00:15:27.420 --> 00:15:27.430
and that's all fine but that doesn't
 

00:15:27.430 --> 00:15:28.980
and that's all fine but that doesn't
mean that my certificate for evil calm

00:15:28.980 --> 00:15:28.990
mean that my certificate for evil calm
 

00:15:28.990 --> 00:15:29.369
mean that my certificate for evil calm
makes

00:15:29.369 --> 00:15:29.379
makes
 

00:15:29.379 --> 00:15:31.259
makes
be trusted for Android comm right I'm

00:15:31.259 --> 00:15:31.269
be trusted for Android comm right I'm
 

00:15:31.269 --> 00:15:34.679
be trusted for Android comm right I'm
only trusted for that and likewise like

00:15:34.679 --> 00:15:34.689
only trusted for that and likewise like
 

00:15:34.689 --> 00:15:35.999
only trusted for that and likewise like
anyone can make a certificate for

00:15:35.999 --> 00:15:36.009
anyone can make a certificate for
 

00:15:36.009 --> 00:15:37.829
anyone can make a certificate for
Android comm and say yes hello I am

00:15:37.829 --> 00:15:37.839
Android comm and say yes hello I am
 

00:15:37.839 --> 00:15:40.650
Android comm and say yes hello I am
Android comm please trust me but you

00:15:40.650 --> 00:15:40.660
Android comm please trust me but you
 

00:15:40.660 --> 00:15:42.179
Android comm please trust me but you
should you actually do make sure that it

00:15:42.179 --> 00:15:42.189
should you actually do make sure that it
 

00:15:42.189 --> 00:15:44.309
should you actually do make sure that it
is trusted and both of these two high

00:15:44.309 --> 00:15:44.319
is trusted and both of these two high
 

00:15:44.319 --> 00:15:45.989
is trusted and both of these two high
level things there's a lot of bad code

00:15:45.989 --> 00:15:45.999
level things there's a lot of bad code
 

00:15:45.999 --> 00:15:47.639
level things there's a lot of bad code
out there on the internet it breaks

00:15:47.639 --> 00:15:47.649
out there on the internet it breaks
 

00:15:47.649 --> 00:15:50.009
out there on the internet it breaks
these so the first one I'm going to talk

00:15:50.009 --> 00:15:50.019
these so the first one I'm going to talk
 

00:15:50.019 --> 00:15:51.839
these so the first one I'm going to talk
about is making sure you're talking to

00:15:51.839 --> 00:15:51.849
about is making sure you're talking to
 

00:15:51.849 --> 00:15:54.179
about is making sure you're talking to
the person you expect to talk to so

00:15:54.179 --> 00:15:54.189
the person you expect to talk to so
 

00:15:54.189 --> 00:15:56.429
the person you expect to talk to so
because obviously if you make a secure

00:15:56.429 --> 00:15:56.439
because obviously if you make a secure
 

00:15:56.439 --> 00:15:58.499
because obviously if you make a secure
connection to evil comm that's probably

00:15:58.499 --> 00:15:58.509
connection to evil comm that's probably
 

00:15:58.509 --> 00:15:59.759
connection to evil comm that's probably
not what you wanted when you wanted to

00:15:59.759 --> 00:15:59.769
not what you wanted when you wanted to
 

00:15:59.769 --> 00:16:01.469
not what you wanted when you wanted to
make a secure connection to Android comm

00:16:01.469 --> 00:16:01.479
make a secure connection to Android comm
 

00:16:01.479 --> 00:16:03.329
make a secure connection to Android comm
to send you know whatever user secrets

00:16:03.339 --> 00:16:05.549
to send you know whatever user secrets
are magic you wanted to send and now

yourself if you're not you have a very
 

00:16:13.689 --> 00:16:16.889
yourself if you're not you have a very
big problem so the problem that gets a

00:16:16.889 --> 00:16:16.899
big problem so the problem that gets a
 

00:16:16.899 --> 00:16:18.569
big problem so the problem that gets a
lot of people to take code off the

Internet is dealing with legacy clients

00:16:20.639 --> 00:16:20.649
Internet is dealing with legacy clients
 

00:16:20.649 --> 00:16:22.710
Internet is dealing with legacy clients
or legacy servers can be kind of tricky

00:16:22.710 --> 00:16:22.720
or legacy servers can be kind of tricky
 

00:16:22.720 --> 00:16:25.049
or legacy servers can be kind of tricky
so say you have a server and on that

00:16:25.049 --> 00:16:25.059
so say you have a server and on that
 

00:16:25.059 --> 00:16:26.579
so say you have a server and on that
server you host a bunch of different

00:16:26.579 --> 00:16:26.589
server you host a bunch of different
 

00:16:26.589 --> 00:16:28.859
server you host a bunch of different
domains like most servers do you have

00:16:28.859 --> 00:16:28.869
domains like most servers do you have
 

00:16:28.869 --> 00:16:31.169

you provide right you've got three

00:16:42.629 --> 00:16:42.639
you provide right you've got three

possibilities you need to provide one
 

00:16:44.549 --> 00:16:47.519
possibilities you need to provide one
which do you do so the good news is that

00:16:47.519 --> 00:16:47.529
which do you do so the good news is that
 

00:16:47.529 --> 00:16:49.259
which do you do so the good news is that
this problem was solved a while ago and

00:16:49.259 --> 00:16:49.269
this problem was solved a while ago and
 

00:16:49.269 --> 00:16:51.299
this problem was solved a while ago and
TLS was with what's called the server

00:16:51.299 --> 00:16:51.309

but you might not always have that so

00:17:01.229 --> 00:17:01.239
but you might not always have that so
 

00:17:01.239 --> 00:17:02.639
but you might not always have that so
for example if you're dealing for really

00:17:02.639 --> 00:17:02.649
for example if you're dealing for really
 

00:17:02.649 --> 00:17:04.619
for example if you're dealing for really
old clients you might not get that or

00:17:04.619 --> 00:17:04.629
old clients you might not get that or
 

00:17:04.629 --> 00:17:07.529
old clients you might not get that or
also if you're using an older protocol

00:17:07.529 --> 00:17:07.539
also if you're using an older protocol
 

00:17:07.539 --> 00:17:09.659
also if you're using an older protocol
like SSL v3 which doesn't support such

00:17:09.659 --> 00:17:09.669
like SSL v3 which doesn't support such
 

00:17:09.669 --> 00:17:11.519
like SSL v3 which doesn't support such
things so how do you make sure that

00:17:11.519 --> 00:17:11.529
things so how do you make sure that
 

00:17:11.529 --> 00:17:14.730
things so how do you make sure that
those connections still work so the

00:17:14.730 --> 00:17:14.740
those connections still work so the
 

00:17:14.740 --> 00:17:16.019
those connections still work so the
right way to do this is a little

00:17:16.019 --> 00:17:16.029
right way to do this is a little
 

00:17:16.029 --> 00:17:18.539
right way to do this is a little
complicated but you basically need to

00:17:18.539 --> 00:17:18.549
complicated but you basically need to
 

00:17:18.549 --> 00:17:20.819
complicated but you basically need to
check that okay I know that the default

00:17:20.819 --> 00:17:20.829
check that okay I know that the default
 

00:17:20.829 --> 00:17:22.139
check that okay I know that the default

for this server is actually gonna give
me example com so when I connect to

00:17:24.689 --> 00:17:24.699
me example com so when I connect to
 

00:17:24.699 --> 00:17:26.189
me example com so when I connect to
example org I'll actually explicitly

00:17:26.189 --> 00:17:26.199
example org I'll actually explicitly
 

00:17:26.199 --> 00:17:27.600
example org I'll actually explicitly
check that I got a certificate for

00:17:27.600 --> 00:17:27.610
check that I got a certificate for
 

00:17:27.610 --> 00:17:30.330
check that I got a certificate for
example com now it's important to say

00:17:30.330 --> 00:17:30.340
example com now it's important to say
 

00:17:30.340 --> 00:17:32.070
example com now it's important to say
that you probably don't need to do this

00:17:32.070 --> 00:17:32.080
that you probably don't need to do this
 

00:17:32.080 --> 00:17:34.409
that you probably don't need to do this
s and I has been supported on Android

00:17:34.409 --> 00:17:34.419
s and I has been supported on Android
 

00:17:34.419 --> 00:17:38.279
s and I has been supported on Android
since 2.3 so if you don't support back

00:17:38.279 --> 00:17:38.289
since 2.3 so if you don't support back
 

00:17:38.289 --> 00:17:40.440
since 2.3 so if you don't support back
that far don't worry about it there is

00:17:40.440 --> 00:17:40.450
that far don't worry about it there is
 

00:17:40.450 --> 00:17:42.640
that far don't worry about it there is
an asterisk around that which is that

00:17:42.640 --> 00:17:42.650
an asterisk around that which is that
 

00:17:42.650 --> 00:17:45.250
an asterisk around that which is that
the way that a lot of HTTP clients work

00:17:45.250 --> 00:17:45.260
the way that a lot of HTTP clients work
 

00:17:45.260 --> 00:17:47.710
the way that a lot of HTTP clients work
is they'll try to connect with sort of

00:17:47.710 --> 00:17:47.720
is they'll try to connect with sort of
 

00:17:47.720 --> 00:17:49.419
is they'll try to connect with sort of
like the most modern TLS settings and

00:17:49.419 --> 00:17:49.429
like the most modern TLS settings and
 

00:17:49.429 --> 00:17:51.310
like the most modern TLS settings and
that may fail because unfortunately on

00:17:51.310 --> 00:17:51.320
that may fail because unfortunately on
 

00:17:51.320 --> 00:17:52.659
that may fail because unfortunately on
the internet there's just a lot of old

00:17:52.659 --> 00:17:52.669
the internet there's just a lot of old
 

00:17:52.669 --> 00:17:54.310
the internet there's just a lot of old
kind of bad networking hardware that

00:17:54.310 --> 00:17:54.320
kind of bad networking hardware that
 

00:17:54.320 --> 00:17:57.130
kind of bad networking hardware that
chokes on TLS and so they'll do sort of

00:17:57.130 --> 00:17:57.140
chokes on TLS and so they'll do sort of
 

00:17:57.140 --> 00:17:59.740
chokes on TLS and so they'll do sort of
a protocol downgrade and that can lead

00:17:59.740 --> 00:17:59.750
a protocol downgrade and that can lead
 

00:17:59.750 --> 00:18:01.990
a protocol downgrade and that can lead
to you decorating to SSL v3 on some

00:18:01.990 --> 00:18:02.000
to you decorating to SSL v3 on some
 

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:03.909
to you decorating to SSL v3 on some
libraries and then at that point you no

00:18:03.909 --> 00:18:03.919
libraries and then at that point you no
 

00:18:03.919 --> 00:18:05.769
libraries and then at that point you no
longer have the subject name field so

00:18:05.769 --> 00:18:05.779
longer have the subject name field so
 

00:18:05.779 --> 00:18:07.779
longer have the subject name field so
you might get the wrong certificate but

00:18:07.779 --> 00:18:07.789
you might get the wrong certificate but
 

00:18:07.789 --> 00:18:10.210
you might get the wrong certificate but
usually if that happens SSL v3 will fail

00:18:10.210 --> 00:18:10.220
usually if that happens SSL v3 will fail
 

00:18:10.220 --> 00:18:11.380
usually if that happens SSL v3 will fail
as well because you're just on a bad

00:18:11.380 --> 00:18:11.390
as well because you're just on a bad
 

00:18:11.390 --> 00:18:15.580
as well because you're just on a bad
network so the wrong way to do this is

00:18:15.580 --> 00:18:15.590
network so the wrong way to do this is
 

00:18:15.590 --> 00:18:17.230
network so the wrong way to do this is
very common advice out there is you

00:18:17.230 --> 00:18:17.240
very common advice out there is you
 

00:18:17.240 --> 00:18:19.029
very common advice out there is you
replace the default hostname verifier

00:18:19.029 --> 00:18:19.039
replace the default hostname verifier
 

00:18:19.039 --> 00:18:20.950
replace the default hostname verifier
with this hostname verifier that always

00:18:20.950 --> 00:18:20.960
with this hostname verifier that always
 

00:18:20.960 --> 00:18:23.950
with this hostname verifier that always
returns true so is evil comm trusted for

00:18:23.950 --> 00:18:23.960
returns true so is evil comm trusted for
 

00:18:23.960 --> 00:18:26.440
returns true so is evil comm trusted for

kind of like obviously bad code please

00:18:28.269 --> 00:18:28.279
kind of like obviously bad code please
 

00:18:28.279 --> 00:18:31.240
kind of like obviously bad code please
don't ever use this like it's very easy

00:18:31.240 --> 00:18:31.250
don't ever use this like it's very easy
 

00:18:31.250 --> 00:18:33.250
don't ever use this like it's very easy
to man the middle I go by a certificate

00:18:33.250 --> 00:18:33.260
to man the middle I go by a certificate
 

00:18:33.260 --> 00:18:35.560

connect so this means that you will

00:18:44.889 --> 00:18:44.899
connect so this means that you will
 

00:18:44.899 --> 00:18:46.779
connect so this means that you will
connect to basically any valid

00:18:46.779 --> 00:18:46.789
connect to basically any valid
 

00:18:46.789 --> 00:18:48.399
connect to basically any valid

certificate and anyone out there can go
buy a valid certificate for their own

00:18:49.810 --> 00:18:49.820
buy a valid certificate for their own
 

00:18:49.820 --> 00:18:52.630
buy a valid certificate for their own
domain it's 20 bucks nowadays you can

00:18:52.630 --> 00:18:52.640
domain it's 20 bucks nowadays you can
 

00:18:52.640 --> 00:18:55.659
domain it's 20 bucks nowadays you can
probably also just get them for free so

00:18:55.659 --> 00:18:55.669
probably also just get them for free so
 

00:18:55.669 --> 00:18:57.840
probably also just get them for free so
even if you have a valid certificate

00:18:57.840 --> 00:18:57.850
even if you have a valid certificate
 

00:18:57.850 --> 00:19:00.159
even if you have a valid certificate
it's not just valid everywhere it's

00:19:00.159 --> 00:19:00.169
it's not just valid everywhere it's
 

00:19:00.169 --> 00:19:01.539
it's not just valid everywhere it's
valid for one specific thing and you

00:19:01.539 --> 00:19:01.549
valid for one specific thing and you
 

00:19:01.549 --> 00:19:02.919
valid for one specific thing and you
really need to make sure that's the case

00:19:02.919 --> 00:19:02.929
really need to make sure that's the case
 

00:19:02.929 --> 00:19:09.279
really need to make sure that's the case
so the the next thing is actually how do

00:19:09.279 --> 00:19:09.289
so the the next thing is actually how do
 

00:19:09.289 --> 00:19:10.450
so the the next thing is actually how do
you make sure that there's the

00:19:10.450 --> 00:19:10.460
you make sure that there's the
 

00:19:10.460 --> 00:19:12.700
you make sure that there's the
certificate that you got is trusted like

00:19:12.700 --> 00:19:12.710
certificate that you got is trusted like
 

00:19:12.710 --> 00:19:15.220
certificate that you got is trusted like
what does that mean so again this is

00:19:15.220 --> 00:19:15.230
what does that mean so again this is
 

00:19:15.230 --> 00:19:16.480
what does that mean so again this is
gonna be very high level I'm not gonna

00:19:16.480 --> 00:19:16.490
gonna be very high level I'm not gonna
 

00:19:16.490 --> 00:19:18.039
gonna be very high level I'm not gonna
go into it a whole lot of detail because

00:19:18.039 --> 00:19:18.049
go into it a whole lot of detail because
 

00:19:18.049 --> 00:19:19.870
go into it a whole lot of detail because
it's very complicated there's rfcs the

00:19:19.870 --> 00:19:19.880
it's very complicated there's rfcs the
 

00:19:19.880 --> 00:19:22.060
it's very complicated there's rfcs the
size of my arm you can read if you wanna

00:19:22.060 --> 00:19:22.070
size of my arm you can read if you wanna
 

00:19:22.070 --> 00:19:23.230
size of my arm you can read if you wanna
know the full detail but this is gonna

00:19:23.230 --> 00:19:23.240
know the full detail but this is gonna
 

00:19:23.240 --> 00:19:25.990
know the full detail but this is gonna
be just a very high level overview so

00:19:25.990 --> 00:19:26.000
be just a very high level overview so
 

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:28.000
be just a very high level overview so
when I say like how do you verify the

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:28.010
when I say like how do you verify the
 

00:19:28.010 --> 00:19:30.220
when I say like how do you verify the
peer so what is the peer in TLS it's

00:19:30.220 --> 00:19:30.230
peer so what is the peer in TLS it's
 

00:19:30.230 --> 00:19:31.899
peer so what is the peer in TLS it's
usually represented by sort of their

00:19:31.899 --> 00:19:31.909
usually represented by sort of their
 

00:19:31.909 --> 00:19:34.510
usually represented by sort of their
certificate that they provide so you

00:19:34.510 --> 00:19:34.520
certificate that they provide so you
 

00:19:34.520 --> 00:19:36.070
certificate that they provide so you
have some options for like how do you

00:19:36.070 --> 00:19:36.080
have some options for like how do you
 

00:19:36.080 --> 00:19:37.690
have some options for like how do you
trust this you could always hard code it

00:19:37.690 --> 00:19:37.700
trust this you could always hard code it
 

00:19:37.700 --> 00:19:39.700
trust this you could always hard code it
but that doesn't really work because

00:19:39.700 --> 00:19:39.710
but that doesn't really work because
 

00:19:39.710 --> 00:19:41.680
but that doesn't really work because
certificates change and they change very

00:19:41.680 --> 00:19:41.690
certificates change and they change very
 

00:19:41.690 --> 00:19:43.450
certificates change and they change very
often for example google.com certificate

00:19:43.450 --> 00:19:43.460
often for example google.com certificate
 

00:19:43.460 --> 00:19:46.149
often for example google.com certificate
it rotates every three months so you

00:19:46.149 --> 00:19:46.159
it rotates every three months so you
 

00:19:46.159 --> 00:19:47.769
it rotates every three months so you
can't just say like in your application

00:19:47.769 --> 00:19:47.779
can't just say like in your application
 

00:19:47.779 --> 00:19:49.419
can't just say like in your application
you know I expect this to get to be this

00:19:49.419 --> 00:19:49.429
you know I expect this to get to be this
 

00:19:49.429 --> 00:19:50.980
you know I expect this to get to be this
because in three months it's gonna be

00:19:50.980 --> 00:19:50.990
because in three months it's gonna be
 

00:19:50.990 --> 00:19:53.409
because in three months it's gonna be
completely different and generally that

00:19:53.409 --> 00:19:53.419
completely different and generally that
 

00:19:53.419 --> 00:19:54.730
completely different and generally that
doesn't scale like what if you're an

00:19:54.730 --> 00:19:54.740
doesn't scale like what if you're an
 

00:19:54.740 --> 00:19:55.830
doesn't scale like what if you're an
application that

00:19:55.830 --> 00:19:55.840
application that
 

00:19:55.840 --> 00:19:57.419
application that
you're like an RSS feed reader and you

00:19:57.419 --> 00:19:57.429
you're like an RSS feed reader and you
 

00:19:57.429 --> 00:19:58.859
you're like an RSS feed reader and you
just kind of got to the Internet you

00:19:58.859 --> 00:19:58.869
just kind of got to the Internet you
 

00:19:58.869 --> 00:20:00.119
just kind of got to the Internet you
obviously can't hard-code the

00:20:00.119 --> 00:20:00.129
obviously can't hard-code the
 

00:20:00.129 --> 00:20:01.680
obviously can't hard-code the
certificate of every webpage on the

00:20:01.680 --> 00:20:01.690
certificate of every webpage on the
 

00:20:01.690 --> 00:20:02.969
certificate of every webpage on the
Internet in your application

00:20:02.969 --> 00:20:02.979
Internet in your application
 

00:20:02.979 --> 00:20:07.259
Internet in your application
I hope don't try so what is the

00:20:07.259 --> 00:20:07.269
I hope don't try so what is the
 

00:20:07.269 --> 00:20:09.869
I hope don't try so what is the
certificate it includes the name so who

00:20:09.869 --> 00:20:09.879
certificate it includes the name so who
 

00:20:09.879 --> 00:20:10.589
certificate it includes the name so who
is this for

00:20:10.589 --> 00:20:10.599
is this for
 

00:20:10.599 --> 00:20:12.209
is this for
includes the public key for the

00:20:12.209 --> 00:20:12.219
includes the public key for the
 

00:20:12.219 --> 00:20:13.799
includes the public key for the
asymmetric crypto should I have to worry

00:20:13.799 --> 00:20:13.809
asymmetric crypto should I have to worry
 

00:20:13.809 --> 00:20:15.599
asymmetric crypto should I have to worry
about for this talk but crypto keys are

00:20:15.599 --> 00:20:15.609
about for this talk but crypto keys are
 

00:20:15.609 --> 00:20:17.519
about for this talk but crypto keys are
in there and it contains an issuer and

00:20:17.519 --> 00:20:17.529
in there and it contains an issuer and
 

00:20:17.529 --> 00:20:19.049
in there and it contains an issuer and
this is someone that's basically said I

00:20:19.049 --> 00:20:19.059
this is someone that's basically said I
 

00:20:19.059 --> 00:20:21.629
this is someone that's basically said I
am stating that you know that

00:20:21.629 --> 00:20:21.639
am stating that you know that
 

00:20:21.639 --> 00:20:23.789
am stating that you know that
cryptographic key up there is tied to

00:20:23.789 --> 00:20:23.799
cryptographic key up there is tied to
 

00:20:23.799 --> 00:20:25.080
cryptographic key up there is tied to
google.com so this would be like

00:20:25.080 --> 00:20:25.090
google.com so this would be like
 

00:20:25.090 --> 00:20:27.029
google.com so this would be like
Verisign or GeoTrust or you know

00:20:27.029 --> 00:20:27.039
Verisign or GeoTrust or you know
 

00:20:27.039 --> 00:20:28.289
Verisign or GeoTrust or you know
certificate authorities you've heard

00:20:28.289 --> 00:20:28.299
certificate authorities you've heard
 

00:20:28.299 --> 00:20:30.060
certificate authorities you've heard
about and it contains a bunch of other

00:20:30.060 --> 00:20:30.070
about and it contains a bunch of other
 

00:20:30.070 --> 00:20:32.729
about and it contains a bunch of other
things yeah expiration day it's key

00:20:32.729 --> 00:20:32.739
things yeah expiration day it's key
 

00:20:32.739 --> 00:20:35.729
things yeah expiration day it's key
usage etc but we'll skip over those so

00:20:35.729 --> 00:20:35.739
usage etc but we'll skip over those so
 

00:20:35.739 --> 00:20:37.680
usage etc but we'll skip over those so
the issuer itself is also a certificate

00:20:37.680 --> 00:20:37.690
the issuer itself is also a certificate
 

00:20:37.690 --> 00:20:39.989
the issuer itself is also a certificate
so school.com certificate is issued by

00:20:39.989 --> 00:20:39.999
so school.com certificate is issued by
 

00:20:39.999 --> 00:20:41.969
so school.com certificate is issued by
Verisign that very science certificates

00:20:41.969 --> 00:20:41.979
Verisign that very science certificates
 

00:20:41.979 --> 00:20:44.190
Verisign that very science certificates
probably by another Verisign and you get

00:20:44.190 --> 00:20:44.200
probably by another Verisign and you get
 

00:20:44.200 --> 00:20:46.529
probably by another Verisign and you get
this chain so you have this nice chain

00:20:46.529 --> 00:20:46.539
this chain so you have this nice chain
 

00:20:46.539 --> 00:20:48.329
this chain so you have this nice chain
but like how do I know if I trust this

00:20:48.329 --> 00:20:48.339
but like how do I know if I trust this
 

00:20:48.339 --> 00:20:50.009
but like how do I know if I trust this
chain sort of like you keep building

00:20:50.009 --> 00:20:50.019
chain sort of like you keep building
 

00:20:50.019 --> 00:20:52.829
chain sort of like you keep building
this but it's kind of Turtles all the

00:20:52.829 --> 00:20:52.839
this but it's kind of Turtles all the
 

00:20:52.839 --> 00:20:54.799
this but it's kind of Turtles all the
way down if you've heard the expression

00:20:54.799 --> 00:20:54.809
way down if you've heard the expression
 

00:20:54.809 --> 00:20:57.389
way down if you've heard the expression
hopefully you have in the end you still

00:20:57.389 --> 00:20:57.399
hopefully you have in the end you still
 

00:20:57.399 --> 00:20:59.700
hopefully you have in the end you still
need to say like do I trust this long

00:20:59.700 --> 00:20:59.710
need to say like do I trust this long
 

00:20:59.710 --> 00:21:00.930
need to say like do I trust this long
chain of certificates and the way you

00:21:00.930 --> 00:21:00.940
chain of certificates and the way you
 

00:21:00.940 --> 00:21:02.849
chain of certificates and the way you
handle it is you know your operating

00:21:02.849 --> 00:21:02.859
handle it is you know your operating
 

00:21:02.859 --> 00:21:05.039
handle it is you know your operating
system or your application ships with a

00:21:05.039 --> 00:21:05.049
system or your application ships with a
 

00:21:05.049 --> 00:21:07.739
system or your application ships with a
set of trusted certificates and so these

00:21:07.739 --> 00:21:07.749
set of trusted certificates and so these
 

00:21:07.749 --> 00:21:09.509
set of trusted certificates and so these
are sort of your very top level routes

00:21:09.509 --> 00:21:09.519
are sort of your very top level routes
 

00:21:09.519 --> 00:21:11.969
are sort of your very top level routes
and then you get a chain from your

00:21:11.969 --> 00:21:11.979
and then you get a chain from your
 

00:21:11.979 --> 00:21:13.320
and then you get a chain from your
server and your server says I'm Google

00:21:13.320 --> 00:21:13.330
server and your server says I'm Google
 

00:21:13.330 --> 00:21:14.909
server and your server says I'm Google
comm and I'm like I don't know that

00:21:14.909 --> 00:21:14.919
comm and I'm like I don't know that
 

00:21:14.919 --> 00:21:16.950
comm and I'm like I don't know that
certificate but I was issued by Verisign

00:21:16.950 --> 00:21:16.960
certificate but I was issued by Verisign
 

00:21:16.960 --> 00:21:18.690
certificate but I was issued by Verisign
and so you know you do the lookup and

00:21:18.690 --> 00:21:18.700
and so you know you do the lookup and
 

00:21:18.700 --> 00:21:20.430
and so you know you do the lookup and
you say oh okay I actually do trust that

00:21:20.430 --> 00:21:20.440
you say oh okay I actually do trust that
 

00:21:20.440 --> 00:21:22.379
you say oh okay I actually do trust that
Verisign certificate it shipped with my

00:21:22.379 --> 00:21:22.389
Verisign certificate it shipped with my
 

00:21:22.389 --> 00:21:25.579
Verisign certificate it shipped with my
application it shipped with the phone so

00:21:25.579 --> 00:21:25.589
application it shipped with the phone so
 

00:21:25.589 --> 00:21:27.479
application it shipped with the phone so
another question that comes up pretty

00:21:27.479 --> 00:21:27.489
another question that comes up pretty
 

00:21:27.489 --> 00:21:29.459
another question that comes up pretty
often so I'm going to kind of detour

00:21:29.459 --> 00:21:29.469
often so I'm going to kind of detour
 

00:21:29.469 --> 00:21:31.289
often so I'm going to kind of detour
into that for a second is how can you

00:21:31.289 --> 00:21:31.299
into that for a second is how can you
 

00:21:31.299 --> 00:21:32.700
into that for a second is how can you
trust the sea-ice on the device you know

00:21:32.700 --> 00:21:32.710
trust the sea-ice on the device you know
 

00:21:32.710 --> 00:21:34.560
trust the sea-ice on the device you know
like you look and there's a hundred or

00:21:34.560 --> 00:21:34.570
like you look and there's a hundred or
 

00:21:34.570 --> 00:21:36.629
like you look and there's a hundred or
so and yeah you don't know who most of

00:21:36.629 --> 00:21:36.639
so and yeah you don't know who most of
 

00:21:36.639 --> 00:21:37.739
so and yeah you don't know who most of
them are like how do you how do you

00:21:37.739 --> 00:21:37.749
them are like how do you how do you
 

00:21:37.749 --> 00:21:39.859
them are like how do you how do you
trust them it's sort of a hot topic so

00:21:39.859 --> 00:21:39.869
trust them it's sort of a hot topic so
 

00:21:39.869 --> 00:21:41.789
trust them it's sort of a hot topic so
there's sort of two things to keep in

00:21:41.789 --> 00:21:41.799
there's sort of two things to keep in
 

00:21:41.799 --> 00:21:42.959
there's sort of two things to keep in
mind when you're asking yourself you

00:21:42.959 --> 00:21:42.969
mind when you're asking yourself you
 

00:21:42.969 --> 00:21:44.879
mind when you're asking yourself you
know how do I trust these guys why can I

00:21:44.879 --> 00:21:44.889
know how do I trust these guys why can I
 

00:21:44.889 --> 00:21:47.070
know how do I trust these guys why can I
trust these guys first of all they do

00:21:47.070 --> 00:21:47.080
trust these guys first of all they do
 

00:21:47.080 --> 00:21:48.839
trust these guys first of all they do
have a lot of strict requirements

00:21:48.839 --> 00:21:48.849
have a lot of strict requirements
 

00:21:48.849 --> 00:21:50.700
have a lot of strict requirements
there's audits etc just to get in sort

00:21:50.700 --> 00:21:50.710
there's audits etc just to get in sort
 

00:21:50.710 --> 00:21:52.320
there's audits etc just to get in sort
of general certificate authority lists

00:21:52.320 --> 00:21:52.330
of general certificate authority lists
 

00:21:52.330 --> 00:21:54.629
of general certificate authority lists
not just for Android but sort of this is

00:21:54.629 --> 00:21:54.639
not just for Android but sort of this is
 

00:21:54.639 --> 00:21:56.639
not just for Android but sort of this is
the standard in the world and finally

00:21:56.639 --> 00:21:56.649
the standard in the world and finally
 

00:21:56.649 --> 00:21:58.320
the standard in the world and finally
like not only is it hard to get in but

00:21:58.320 --> 00:21:58.330
like not only is it hard to get in but
 

00:21:58.330 --> 00:22:00.389
like not only is it hard to get in but
there's actually a lot of work to verify

00:22:00.389 --> 00:22:00.399
there's actually a lot of work to verify
 

00:22:00.399 --> 00:22:02.489
there's actually a lot of work to verify
that you know is doing anything bad so

00:22:02.489 --> 00:22:02.499
that you know is doing anything bad so
 

00:22:02.499 --> 00:22:03.599
that you know is doing anything bad so
you have things like certificate

00:22:03.599 --> 00:22:03.609
you have things like certificate
 

00:22:03.609 --> 00:22:05.129
you have things like certificate
transparency where you actually note

00:22:05.129 --> 00:22:05.139
transparency where you actually note
 

00:22:05.139 --> 00:22:07.259
transparency where you actually note
down like what certificates have you

00:22:07.259 --> 00:22:07.269
down like what certificates have you
 

00:22:07.269 --> 00:22:09.180
down like what certificates have you
issued or things like

00:22:09.180 --> 00:22:09.190
issued or things like
 

00:22:09.190 --> 00:22:10.980
issued or things like
so that you can actually detect if

00:22:10.980 --> 00:22:10.990
so that you can actually detect if
 

00:22:10.990 --> 00:22:13.350
so that you can actually detect if
anywhere in the world someone misses a

00:22:13.350 --> 00:22:13.360
anywhere in the world someone misses a
 

00:22:13.360 --> 00:22:15.780
anywhere in the world someone misses a
certificate even if it's you know only

00:22:15.780 --> 00:22:15.790
certificate even if it's you know only
 

00:22:15.790 --> 00:22:18.750
certificate even if it's you know only
used once and that lets you know detect

00:22:18.750 --> 00:22:18.760
used once and that lets you know detect
 

00:22:18.760 --> 00:22:20.490
used once and that lets you know detect
misuse and then from there you know

00:22:20.490 --> 00:22:20.500
misuse and then from there you know
 

00:22:20.500 --> 00:22:22.050
misuse and then from there you know
there's risks to business you know all

00:22:22.050 --> 00:22:22.060
there's risks to business you know all
 

00:22:22.060 --> 00:22:23.910
there's risks to business you know all
that fun stuff so

00:22:23.910 --> 00:22:23.920
that fun stuff so
 

00:22:23.920 --> 00:22:25.680
that fun stuff so
okay back to trust checking so the

00:22:25.680 --> 00:22:25.690
okay back to trust checking so the
 

00:22:25.690 --> 00:22:27.210
okay back to trust checking so the
problem is is what if you want to trust

00:22:27.210 --> 00:22:27.220
problem is is what if you want to trust
 

00:22:27.220 --> 00:22:28.560
problem is is what if you want to trust
your own certificate that the system

00:22:28.560 --> 00:22:28.570
your own certificate that the system
 

00:22:28.570 --> 00:22:31.260
your own certificate that the system
doesn't normally trust then this can be

00:22:31.260 --> 00:22:31.270
doesn't normally trust then this can be
 

00:22:31.270 --> 00:22:33.180
doesn't normally trust then this can be
for a couple of reasons maybe you want

00:22:33.180 --> 00:22:33.190
for a couple of reasons maybe you want
 

00:22:33.190 --> 00:22:34.770
for a couple of reasons maybe you want
to use your own certificate just for

00:22:34.770 --> 00:22:34.780
to use your own certificate just for
 

00:22:34.780 --> 00:22:36.840
to use your own certificate just for
local debugging right you don't want to

00:22:36.840 --> 00:22:36.850
local debugging right you don't want to
 

00:22:36.850 --> 00:22:38.730
local debugging right you don't want to
take the certificate for your actual

00:22:38.730 --> 00:22:38.740
take the certificate for your actual
 

00:22:38.740 --> 00:22:40.290
take the certificate for your actual
back-end and put it on your random

00:22:40.290 --> 00:22:40.300
back-end and put it on your random
 

00:22:40.300 --> 00:22:41.760

not a good idea that just doesn't feel

00:22:43.050 --> 00:22:43.060
not a good idea that just doesn't feel
 

00:22:43.060 --> 00:22:45.810
not a good idea that just doesn't feel
right and secondly you might actually

00:22:45.810 --> 00:22:45.820
right and secondly you might actually
 

00:22:45.820 --> 00:22:47.880
right and secondly you might actually
just not trust certificate authorities

00:22:47.880 --> 00:22:47.890
just not trust certificate authorities
 

00:22:47.890 --> 00:22:50.490
just not trust certificate authorities
like sure I made a very quick argument

00:22:50.490 --> 00:22:50.500
like sure I made a very quick argument
 

00:22:50.500 --> 00:22:52.680
like sure I made a very quick argument
about why they're a pretty reasonable

00:22:52.680 --> 00:22:52.690
about why they're a pretty reasonable
 

00:22:52.690 --> 00:22:55.170
about why they're a pretty reasonable
source of trust but maybe you don't want

00:22:55.170 --> 00:22:55.180
source of trust but maybe you don't want
 

00:22:55.180 --> 00:22:57.540
source of trust but maybe you don't want
to and that's fine so maybe you want to

00:22:57.540 --> 00:22:57.550
to and that's fine so maybe you want to
 

00:22:57.550 --> 00:22:59.130
to and that's fine so maybe you want to
run your own certificate authority and

00:22:59.130 --> 00:22:59.140
run your own certificate authority and
 

00:22:59.140 --> 00:23:00.600
run your own certificate authority and
ship that with your app and only trust

00:23:00.600 --> 00:23:00.610
ship that with your app and only trust
 

00:23:00.610 --> 00:23:03.390
ship that with your app and only trust
that or maybe you have you know some

00:23:03.390 --> 00:23:03.400
that or maybe you have you know some
 

00:23:03.400 --> 00:23:04.860
that or maybe you have you know some
internal network and you issue

00:23:04.860 --> 00:23:04.870
internal network and you issue
 

00:23:04.870 --> 00:23:06.720
internal network and you issue
certificates for internal webpages using

00:23:06.720 --> 00:23:06.730
certificates for internal webpages using
 

00:23:06.730 --> 00:23:08.910

that and that's obviously not trusted by

00:23:08.910 --> 00:23:08.920
that and that's obviously not trusted by
 

00:23:08.920 --> 00:23:10.830
that and that's obviously not trusted by
the device by default so you need to

00:23:10.830 --> 00:23:10.840

sort of ship it with your app and make

sort of ship it with your app and make

but the real gist of it is you basically

00:23:34.560 --> 00:23:34.570
but the real gist of it is you basically
 

00:23:34.570 --> 00:23:36.240
but the real gist of it is you basically
take the certificates you want to use

00:23:36.240 --> 00:23:36.250
take the certificates you want to use
 

00:23:36.250 --> 00:23:38.280
take the certificates you want to use
and you tell the system okay these are

00:23:38.280 --> 00:23:38.290
and you tell the system okay these are

this code isn't the clearest so it's

00:23:50.880 --> 00:23:50.890
this code isn't the clearest so it's
 

00:23:50.890 --> 00:23:51.900
this code isn't the clearest so it's
gonna require a little bit of

00:23:51.900 --> 00:23:51.910
gonna require a little bit of
 

00:23:51.910 --> 00:23:53.160
gonna require a little bit of
explanation because it's it's very

00:23:53.160 --> 00:23:53.170
explanation because it's it's very
 

00:23:53.170 --> 00:23:55.890
explanation because it's it's very
verbose so we make an SSL context not

00:23:55.890 --> 00:23:55.900
verbose so we make an SSL context not
 

00:23:55.900 --> 00:23:57.870
verbose so we make an SSL context not
important we make a new exponent trust

00:23:57.870 --> 00:23:57.880
important we make a new exponent trust
 

00:23:57.880 --> 00:23:59.790
important we make a new exponent trust
manager and it has these three methods

then we set this as the default socket

00:24:05.130 --> 00:24:05.140
then we set this as the default socket

so what does this actually do so we have

00:24:09.990 --> 00:24:10.000
so what does this actually do so we have
 

00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:11.970
so what does this actually do so we have
this blank check server trusted method

00:24:11.970 --> 00:24:11.980
this blank check server trusted method
 

00:24:11.980 --> 00:24:12.840
this blank check server trusted method
what does that mean

00:24:12.840 --> 00:24:12.850
what does that mean
 

00:24:12.850 --> 00:24:14.580
what does that mean
well if you go and you actually look at

well if you go and you actually look at
 

00:24:14.590 --> 00:24:16.940
well if you go and you actually look at
the real documentation and you read

00:24:16.940 --> 00:24:16.950
the real documentation and you read
 

00:24:16.950 --> 00:24:19.530
the real documentation and you read

okay so that lime is completely empty
so it will never throw that certificate

00:24:27.660 --> 00:24:27.670

straight up just oh use this code and

straight up just oh use this code and
 

00:26:40.130 --> 00:26:42.130
straight up just oh use this code and
you won't get this to be an exception

00:26:42.130 --> 00:26:42.140
you won't get this to be an exception
 

00:26:42.140 --> 00:26:43.450
you won't get this to be an exception
anymore which is technically correct

00:26:43.450 --> 00:26:43.460
anymore which is technically correct
 

00:26:43.460 --> 00:26:44.950
anymore which is technically correct
because you can never get the

00:26:44.950 --> 00:26:44.960
because you can never get the
 

00:26:44.960 --> 00:26:46.270
because you can never get the

00:26:46.280 --> 00:26:48.669
certificate exception if you use that
code but that's probably not what you

telling the fix it not just for these
 

00:27:38.690 --> 00:27:41.340
telling the fix it not just for these
bugs but for actually a whole slew of

bugs but for actually a whole slew of
 

00:27:41.350 --> 00:27:45.039
bugs but for actually a whole slew of
security issues next up this is what I

00:27:45.039 --> 00:27:45.049
security issues next up this is what I
 

00:27:45.049 --> 00:27:46.120
security issues next up this is what I
spend a lot of time doing is actually

00:27:46.120 --> 00:27:46.130
spend a lot of time doing is actually
 

00:27:46.130 --> 00:27:48.580
spend a lot of time doing is actually
tools to find these issues and

00:27:48.580 --> 00:27:48.590
tools to find these issues and
 

00:27:48.590 --> 00:27:50.350

there's unfortunately a complete lack of
 

00:27:52.490 --> 00:27:54.520
there's unfortunately a complete lack of
tools to do this when I started so I

00:27:54.520 --> 00:27:54.530
tools to do this when I started so I
 

00:27:54.530 --> 00:27:56.890
tools to do this when I started so I
built one and you know finally

00:27:56.890 --> 00:27:56.900
built one and you know finally
 

00:27:56.900 --> 00:27:58.870
built one and you know finally
investigating api's that make it harder

investigating api's that make it harder
 

00:27:58.880 --> 00:28:00.789
investigating api's that make it harder
to do things wrong a general rule for

00:28:00.789 --> 00:28:00.799
to do things wrong a general rule for
 

00:28:00.799 --> 00:28:03.580
to do things wrong a general rule for
security api's and if you ever design

00:28:03.580 --> 00:28:03.590
security api's and if you ever design
 

00:28:03.590 --> 00:28:04.840
security api's and if you ever design
anything security to keep this in mind

anything security to keep this in mind
 

00:28:04.850 --> 00:28:06.520
anything security to keep this in mind
it should always be easy to do the

00:28:06.520 --> 00:28:06.530
it should always be easy to do the
 

00:28:06.530 --> 00:28:08.020
it should always be easy to do the
secure thing and really hard or

00:28:08.020 --> 00:28:08.030
secure thing and really hard or
 

00:28:08.030 --> 00:28:09.580
secure thing and really hard or
impossible to do the insecure thing

00:28:09.580 --> 00:28:09.590
impossible to do the insecure thing
 

00:28:09.590 --> 00:28:11.590

right like over customization is

00:28:11.590 --> 00:28:11.600
right like over customization is
 

00:28:11.600 --> 00:28:14.080
right like over customization is
actually your enemy here so looking at

00:28:14.080 --> 00:28:14.090
actually your enemy here so looking at
 

00:28:14.090 --> 00:28:16.600
actually your enemy here so looking at
things on that it's a move away from

00:28:16.600 --> 00:28:16.610
things on that it's a move away from
 

00:28:16.610 --> 00:28:18.310
things on that it's a move away from
these api's that are really easy to get

00:28:18.310 --> 00:28:18.320
these api's that are really easy to get
 

00:28:18.320 --> 00:28:20.200
these api's that are really easy to get
wrong like the trust managing code is

00:28:20.200 --> 00:28:20.210
wrong like the trust managing code is
 

00:28:20.210 --> 00:28:23.680
wrong like the trust managing code is
way too easy to break so some notes on

00:28:23.680 --> 00:28:23.690
way too easy to break so some notes on
 

00:28:23.690 --> 00:28:26.049
way too easy to break so some notes on
that vulnerability alert and blocking so

00:28:26.049 --> 00:28:26.059
that vulnerability alert and blocking so
 

00:28:26.059 --> 00:28:28.210
that vulnerability alert and blocking so
if we detect a vulnerability in your

00:28:28.210 --> 00:28:28.220
if we detect a vulnerability in your
 

00:28:28.220 --> 00:28:31.060
if we detect a vulnerability in your
application for SSL old libraries those

00:28:31.060 --> 00:28:31.070
application for SSL old libraries those
 

00:28:31.070 --> 00:28:32.320
application for SSL old libraries those
kinds of things you'll get a

00:28:32.320 --> 00:28:32.330
kinds of things you'll get a
 

00:28:32.330 --> 00:28:34.000
kinds of things you'll get a
vulnerability alert via the email on

00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:34.010
vulnerability alert via the email on
 

00:28:34.010 --> 00:28:35.110
vulnerability alert via the email on
your console and you'll get a

00:28:35.110 --> 00:28:35.120
your console and you'll get a
 

00:28:35.120 --> 00:28:38.020
your console and you'll get a
notification on that page make sure you

00:28:38.020 --> 00:28:38.030
notification on that page make sure you
 

00:28:38.030 --> 00:28:39.370
notification on that page make sure you
actually go and check these and fix them

00:28:39.370 --> 00:28:39.380
actually go and check these and fix them
 

00:28:39.380 --> 00:28:40.899
actually go and check these and fix them

it depends the certificate right I mean

00:31:37.910 --> 00:31:37.920
it depends the certificate right I mean
 

00:31:37.920 --> 00:31:39.800
it depends the certificate right I mean
I suppose if they added a certificate

00:31:39.800 --> 00:31:39.810

there a way for my app to decline all

00:32:01.010 --> 00:32:01.020
there a way for my app to decline all
 

00:32:01.020 --> 00:32:03.560
there a way for my app to decline all
like custom and only use the trusted

00:32:03.560 --> 00:32:03.570
like custom and only use the trusted
 

00:32:03.570 --> 00:32:04.810
like custom and only use the trusted
store that that comes with the device

00:32:04.810 --> 00:32:04.820
store that that comes with the device
 

00:32:04.820 --> 00:32:08.330
store that that comes with the device
yeah so already like you can specify the

00:32:08.330 --> 00:32:08.340
yeah so already like you can specify the
 

00:32:08.340 --> 00:32:11.060
yeah so already like you can specify the
like custom set of trusted certificates

00:32:11.060 --> 00:32:11.070
like custom set of trusted certificates
 

00:32:11.070 --> 00:32:12.860
like custom set of trusted certificates
like I mentioned earlier you can easily

00:32:12.860 --> 00:32:12.870
like I mentioned earlier you can easily
 

00:32:12.870 --> 00:32:14.840
like I mentioned earlier you can easily
just only trust the ones from the system

00:32:14.840 --> 00:32:14.850
just only trust the ones from the system
 

00:32:14.850 --> 00:32:17.360
just only trust the ones from the system
if that's what you'd like to do you

00:32:17.360 --> 00:32:17.370
if that's what you'd like to do you
 

00:32:17.370 --> 00:32:18.680
if that's what you'd like to do you
should be very careful doing that though

00:32:18.680 --> 00:32:18.690
should be very careful doing that though
 

00:32:18.690 --> 00:32:20.660
should be very careful doing that though
because if you do that there's a good

00:32:20.660 --> 00:32:20.670
because if you do that there's a good
 

00:32:20.670 --> 00:32:22.100
because if you do that there's a good
chance that your device might not

00:32:22.100 --> 00:32:22.110
chance that your device might not
 

00:32:22.110 --> 00:32:24.590
chance that your device might not
connect again say for example they added

00:32:24.590 --> 00:32:24.600
connect again say for example they added
 

00:32:24.600 --> 00:32:27.080
connect again say for example they added
that you know testing cert that they're

00:32:27.080 --> 00:32:27.090
that you know testing cert that they're
 

00:32:27.090 --> 00:32:28.130
that you know testing cert that they're
made among all the connections with

00:32:28.130 --> 00:32:28.140
made among all the connections with
 

00:32:28.140 --> 00:32:29.780
made among all the connections with
chance to do debugging and similar if

00:32:29.780 --> 00:32:29.790
chance to do debugging and similar if
 

00:32:29.790 --> 00:32:31.850
chance to do debugging and similar if
you don't trust that CA that basically

00:32:31.850 --> 00:32:31.860
you don't trust that CA that basically
 

00:32:31.860 --> 00:32:33.320
you don't trust that CA that basically
means that device you're never your apps

00:32:33.320 --> 00:32:33.330
means that device you're never your apps
 

00:32:33.330 --> 00:32:34.580
means that device you're never your apps
never gonna succeed in the connection

00:32:34.580 --> 00:32:34.590
never gonna succeed in the connection
 

00:32:34.590 --> 00:32:36.740
never gonna succeed in the connection
again so it's a trade off you have to

00:32:36.740 --> 00:32:36.750
again so it's a trade off you have to
 

00:32:36.750 --> 00:32:38.420
again so it's a trade off you have to
keep in mind some people have made that

00:32:38.420 --> 00:32:38.430
keep in mind some people have made that
 

00:32:38.430 --> 00:32:41.420
keep in mind some people have made that
trade-off for security reasons but just

00:32:41.420 --> 00:32:41.430
trade-off for security reasons but just
 

00:32:41.430 --> 00:32:45.620
trade-off for security reasons but just
keep that in mind yes

00:32:45.620 --> 00:32:45.630
keep that in mind yes
 

00:32:45.630 --> 00:32:50.450
keep that in mind yes
alright so through the years the webview

00:32:50.450 --> 00:32:50.460
alright so through the years the webview
 

00:32:50.460 --> 00:32:52.490
alright so through the years the webview
has been made as a component that can

00:32:52.490 --> 00:32:52.500
has been made as a component that can
 

00:32:52.500 --> 00:32:54.680
has been made as a component that can
update independently of the framework

00:32:54.680 --> 00:32:54.690
update independently of the framework
 

00:32:54.690 --> 00:32:56.660
update independently of the framework
and I'm wondering if there's any plans

00:32:56.660 --> 00:32:56.670
and I'm wondering if there's any plans
 

00:32:56.670 --> 00:32:58.190
and I'm wondering if there's any plans
of doing the same thing possibly with

00:32:58.190 --> 00:32:58.200
of doing the same thing possibly with
 

00:32:58.200 --> 00:33:00.530
of doing the same thing possibly with
the boring SSL or essentially whatever

00:33:00.530 --> 00:33:00.540
the boring SSL or essentially whatever
 

00:33:00.540 --> 00:33:02.900
the boring SSL or essentially whatever
SSL libraries being used so actually

00:33:02.900 --> 00:33:02.910
SSL libraries being used so actually
 

00:33:02.910 --> 00:33:05.120
SSL libraries being used so actually
that already exists through Play

00:33:05.120 --> 00:33:05.130
that already exists through Play
 

00:33:05.130 --> 00:33:06.380
that already exists through Play
services there's what's called a

00:33:06.380 --> 00:33:06.390
services there's what's called a
 

00:33:06.390 --> 00:33:08.030
services there's what's called a
provider installer which actually does

00:33:08.030 --> 00:33:08.040
provider installer which actually does
 

00:33:08.040 --> 00:33:10.070
provider installer which actually does
install the most up-to-date version of

00:33:10.070 --> 00:33:10.080
install the most up-to-date version of
 

00:33:10.080 --> 00:33:11.870
install the most up-to-date version of
con script which is the library that

00:33:11.870 --> 00:33:11.880
con script which is the library that
 

00:33:11.880 --> 00:33:12.460
con script which is the library that
does all the

00:33:12.460 --> 00:33:12.470
does all the
 

00:33:12.470 --> 00:33:14.289
does all the
a cell on Android so it's actually

00:33:14.289 --> 00:33:14.299
a cell on Android so it's actually
 

00:33:14.299 --> 00:33:16.240
a cell on Android so it's actually
already there it's called provider

00:33:16.240 --> 00:33:16.250
already there it's called provider
 

00:33:16.250 --> 00:33:18.250
already there it's called provider
installer I believe it's linked on the

00:33:18.250 --> 00:33:18.260
installer I believe it's linked on the
 

00:33:18.260 --> 00:33:22.270
installer I believe it's linked on the
SSL training document as well and it's

00:33:22.270 --> 00:33:22.280
SSL training document as well and it's
 

00:33:22.280 --> 00:33:27.240
SSL training document as well and it's
exactly what you asked for

00:33:27.240 --> 00:33:27.250
 

00:33:27.250 --> 00:33:30.100
well my question was a little related to

00:33:30.100 --> 00:33:30.110
well my question was a little related to
 

00:33:30.110 --> 00:33:31.330
well my question was a little related to
the question he has two bit ago about

00:33:31.330 --> 00:33:31.340
the question he has two bit ago about
 

00:33:31.340 --> 00:33:33.700
the question he has two bit ago about
the user installed certificates and I

00:33:33.700 --> 00:33:33.710
the user installed certificates and I
 

00:33:33.710 --> 00:33:34.840
the user installed certificates and I
was wondering if Android is doing

00:33:34.840 --> 00:33:34.850
was wondering if Android is doing
 

00:33:34.850 --> 00:33:39.610
was wondering if Android is doing
anything to really warn users more about

00:33:39.610 --> 00:33:39.620
anything to really warn users more about
 

00:33:39.620 --> 00:33:41.799
anything to really warn users more about
that like so um you know one place i

00:33:41.799 --> 00:33:41.809
that like so um you know one place i
 

00:33:41.809 --> 00:33:43.320
that like so um you know one place i
think i've is lenovo they shipped with

00:33:43.320 --> 00:33:43.330
think i've is lenovo they shipped with
 

00:33:43.330 --> 00:33:46.120
think i've is lenovo they shipped with
you know these bad root certificates and

00:33:46.120 --> 00:33:46.130
you know these bad root certificates and
 

00:33:46.130 --> 00:33:47.919
you know these bad root certificates and
then i also think about like you go to a

00:33:47.919 --> 00:33:47.929
then i also think about like you go to a
 

00:33:47.929 --> 00:33:49.450
then i also think about like you go to a
coffee shop where somebody's created an

00:33:49.450 --> 00:33:49.460
coffee shop where somebody's created an
 

00:33:49.460 --> 00:33:50.680
coffee shop where somebody's created an
open network and they've got like

00:33:50.680 --> 00:33:50.690
open network and they've got like
 

00:33:50.690 --> 00:33:53.169
open network and they've got like
charles running on their laptop and they

00:33:53.169 --> 00:33:53.179
charles running on their laptop and they
 

00:33:53.179 --> 00:33:54.760
charles running on their laptop and they
force you to install their ticket to

00:33:54.760 --> 00:33:54.770
force you to install their ticket to
 

00:33:54.770 --> 00:33:59.430
force you to install their ticket to
connect so okay so a couple things so

00:33:59.430 --> 00:33:59.440
connect so okay so a couple things so
 

00:33:59.440 --> 00:34:01.779
connect so okay so a couple things so
there is already notification if you

00:34:01.779 --> 00:34:01.789
there is already notification if you
 

00:34:01.789 --> 00:34:03.100
there is already notification if you
install certificate in fact there's a

00:34:03.100 --> 00:34:03.110
install certificate in fact there's a
 

00:34:03.110 --> 00:34:05.260
install certificate in fact there's a
very scary warning that says like we

00:34:05.260 --> 00:34:05.270
very scary warning that says like we
 

00:34:05.270 --> 00:34:06.549
very scary warning that says like we
like your network traffic may be

00:34:06.549 --> 00:34:06.559
like your network traffic may be
 

00:34:06.559 --> 00:34:07.810
like your network traffic may be
monitored we basically have no

00:34:07.810 --> 00:34:07.820
monitored we basically have no
 

00:34:07.820 --> 00:34:09.639
monitored we basically have no
guarantees for you at this point because

00:34:09.639 --> 00:34:09.649
guarantees for you at this point because
 

00:34:09.649 --> 00:34:13.599
guarantees for you at this point because
that's true for the lenovo case that's a

00:34:13.599 --> 00:34:13.609
that's true for the lenovo case that's a
 

00:34:13.609 --> 00:34:14.950
that's true for the lenovo case that's a
little different because it wasn't user

00:34:14.950 --> 00:34:14.960
little different because it wasn't user
 

00:34:14.960 --> 00:34:16.359
little different because it wasn't user
at it it shipped with sort of the

00:34:16.359 --> 00:34:16.369
at it it shipped with sort of the
 

00:34:16.369 --> 00:34:20.200
at it it shipped with sort of the
trusted set for that we have CTS or we

00:34:20.200 --> 00:34:20.210
trusted set for that we have CTS or we
 

00:34:20.210 --> 00:34:21.730
trusted set for that we have CTS or we
have CTS tests to sort of make sure we

00:34:21.730 --> 00:34:21.740
have CTS tests to sort of make sure we
 

00:34:21.740 --> 00:34:23.139
have CTS tests to sort of make sure we
don't have somewhere issues like that on

00:34:23.139 --> 00:34:23.149
don't have somewhere issues like that on
 

00:34:23.149 --> 00:34:25.300
don't have somewhere issues like that on
Android for the final thing of you

00:34:25.300 --> 00:34:25.310
Android for the final thing of you
 

00:34:25.310 --> 00:34:27.730
Android for the final thing of you
connect to a network yes if you trick

00:34:27.730 --> 00:34:27.740
connect to a network yes if you trick
 

00:34:27.740 --> 00:34:29.290
connect to a network yes if you trick
the user or you kind of conned them into

00:34:29.290 --> 00:34:29.300
the user or you kind of conned them into
 

00:34:29.300 --> 00:34:30.700
the user or you kind of conned them into
installing a cert that would be bad

00:34:30.700 --> 00:34:30.710
installing a cert that would be bad
 

00:34:30.710 --> 00:34:33.339
installing a cert that would be bad
there is a lot of scary wording already

00:34:33.339 --> 00:34:33.349
there is a lot of scary wording already
 

00:34:33.349 --> 00:34:35.109
there is a lot of scary wording already
around that so I don't know how

00:34:35.109 --> 00:34:35.119
around that so I don't know how
 

00:34:35.119 --> 00:34:36.970
around that so I don't know how
realistic that is of actually convincing

00:34:36.970 --> 00:34:36.980
realistic that is of actually convincing
 

00:34:36.980 --> 00:34:38.619
realistic that is of actually convincing
someone like please install my charles

00:34:38.619 --> 00:34:38.629
someone like please install my charles
 

00:34:38.629 --> 00:34:45.970
someone like please install my charles
CA but that would be bad

00:34:45.970 --> 00:34:45.980
 

00:34:45.980 --> 00:34:52.450
we have one here and then back as well

00:34:52.450 --> 00:34:52.460
 

00:34:52.460 --> 00:34:55.160
hi I just had a question about a

00:34:55.160 --> 00:34:55.170
hi I just had a question about a
 

00:34:55.170 --> 00:34:57.470
hi I just had a question about a
certificate pinning what is your opinion

00:34:57.470 --> 00:34:57.480
certificate pinning what is your opinion
 

00:34:57.480 --> 00:34:58.040
certificate pinning what is your opinion
about it

00:34:58.040 --> 00:34:58.050
about it
 

00:34:58.050 --> 00:35:00.920
about it
as with the other examples that you show

00:35:00.920 --> 00:35:00.930
as with the other examples that you show
 

00:35:00.930 --> 00:35:02.540
as with the other examples that you show
there's a lot of bad examples about

00:35:02.540 --> 00:35:02.550
there's a lot of bad examples about
 

00:35:02.550 --> 00:35:03.950
there's a lot of bad examples about
certificate pinning and there's also a

00:35:03.950 --> 00:35:03.960
certificate pinning and there's also a
 

00:35:03.960 --> 00:35:05.150
certificate pinning and there's also a
couple of libraries that are actually

00:35:05.150 --> 00:35:05.160
couple of libraries that are actually
 

00:35:05.160 --> 00:35:08.450
couple of libraries that are actually
doing it and in the official Docs of

00:35:08.450 --> 00:35:08.460
doing it and in the official Docs of
 

00:35:08.460 --> 00:35:10.940
doing it and in the official Docs of
these there's nothing specific about it

00:35:10.940 --> 00:35:10.950
these there's nothing specific about it
 

00:35:10.950 --> 00:35:16.160
these there's nothing specific about it
so so yes so there is there's no current

00:35:16.160 --> 00:35:16.170
so so yes so there is there's no current
 

00:35:16.170 --> 00:35:17.690
so so yes so there is there's no current
any public API to do it as far as

00:35:17.690 --> 00:35:17.700
any public API to do it as far as
 

00:35:17.700 --> 00:35:20.240
any public API to do it as far as
certificate pinning it's useful in

00:35:20.240 --> 00:35:20.250
certificate pinning it's useful in
 

00:35:20.250 --> 00:35:21.770
certificate pinning it's useful in
general what certificate pinning is for

00:35:21.770 --> 00:35:21.780
general what certificate pinning is for
 

00:35:21.780 --> 00:35:22.820
general what certificate pinning is for
those of you who don't know is you

00:35:22.820 --> 00:35:22.830
those of you who don't know is you
 

00:35:22.830 --> 00:35:24.740
those of you who don't know is you
basically say I expected this

00:35:24.740 --> 00:35:24.750
basically say I expected this
 

00:35:24.750 --> 00:35:26.510
basically say I expected this
certificate to show up somewhere in the

00:35:26.510 --> 00:35:26.520
certificate to show up somewhere in the
 

00:35:26.520 --> 00:35:28.520
certificate to show up somewhere in the

that you need to be careful of is if

00:35:39.560 --> 00:35:39.570
that you need to be careful of is if
 

00:35:39.570 --> 00:35:41.870
that you need to be careful of is if
your app has pinning code and you you

00:35:41.870 --> 00:35:41.880
your app has pinning code and you you
 

00:35:41.880 --> 00:35:43.460
your app has pinning code and you you
know suddenly need to change your

00:35:43.460 --> 00:35:43.470
know suddenly need to change your
 

00:35:43.470 --> 00:35:47.180
know suddenly need to change your
certificate you may break pinning and if

00:35:47.180 --> 00:35:47.190
certificate you may break pinning and if
 

00:35:47.190 --> 00:35:48.590
certificate you may break pinning and if
that happens you're kind of out of luck

00:35:48.590 --> 00:35:48.600
that happens you're kind of out of luck
 

00:35:48.600 --> 00:35:50.420
that happens you're kind of out of luck
but something to keep in mind pinning in

00:35:50.420 --> 00:35:50.430
but something to keep in mind pinning in
 

00:35:50.430 --> 00:35:52.850
but something to keep in mind pinning in
general is a good thing I know

I support there are less bad examples of

I support there are less bad examples of
 

00:36:03.120 --> 00:36:05.150
I support there are less bad examples of
code for it just because there's

00:36:05.150 --> 00:36:05.160
code for it just because there's
 

00:36:05.160 --> 00:36:07.160
code for it just because there's
honestly just a lot less examples of

honestly just a lot less examples of
 

00:36:07.170 --> 00:36:09.350
honestly just a lot less examples of

overriding the trust manager code just

00:36:12.530 --> 00:36:12.540
overriding the trust manager code just
 

00:36:12.540 --> 00:36:13.910
overriding the trust manager code just
there's not a lot of code out there for

there's not a lot of code out there for

right so people get mean so yeah so

00:37:00.440 --> 00:37:00.450
right so people get mean so yeah so
 

00:37:00.450 --> 00:37:02.420
right so people get mean so yeah so
dealing with old servers so what you'd

00:37:02.420 --> 00:37:02.430
dealing with old servers so what you'd
 

00:37:02.430 --> 00:37:04.070

the unfortunate thing there is it ends

00:37:16.070 --> 00:37:16.080
the unfortunate thing there is it ends

up just being like upgrade the ciphers

00:37:18.230 --> 00:37:18.240
up just being like upgrade the ciphers
 

00:37:18.240 --> 00:37:20.330
up just being like upgrade the ciphers
on your server and that's really

00:37:20.330 --> 00:37:20.340
on your server and that's really
 

00:37:20.340 --> 00:37:21.860
on your server and that's really
dependent on your like what

probably couldn't give you like specific
advice unless you're doing the exact

shenanigans that I like to do don't do

00:37:31.280 --> 00:37:31.290
shenanigans that I like to do don't do
 

00:37:31.290 --> 00:37:34.580
shenanigans that I like to do don't do
that so I don't know the best thing to

00:37:34.580 --> 00:37:34.590
that so I don't know the best thing to
 

00:37:34.590 --> 00:37:36.170
that so I don't know the best thing to
do for good advice on that unfortunately

00:37:36.170 --> 00:37:36.180
do for good advice on that unfortunately
 

00:37:36.180 --> 00:37:38.540
do for good advice on that unfortunately
I know people are working on it people

00:37:38.540 --> 00:37:38.550
I know people are working on it people
 

00:37:38.550 --> 00:37:39.890
I know people are working on it people
much better at that kind of thing than I

00:37:39.890 --> 00:37:39.900
much better at that kind of thing than I
 

00:37:39.900 --> 00:37:41.960
much better at that kind of thing than I
am but I don't have any super great

00:37:41.960 --> 00:37:41.970
am but I don't have any super great
 

00:37:41.970 --> 00:37:48.960
am but I don't have any super great
advice for you unfortunately

00:37:48.960 --> 00:37:48.970
 

00:37:48.970 --> 00:37:50.640
anybody else have questions otherwise

00:37:50.640 --> 00:37:50.650
anybody else have questions otherwise
 

00:37:50.650 --> 00:37:53.630
anybody else have questions otherwise
you can get yeah so you talked about

00:37:53.630 --> 00:37:53.640
you can get yeah so you talked about
 

00:37:53.640 --> 00:37:56.640
you can get yeah so you talked about
basically how to trust a server mm-hm

00:37:56.640 --> 00:37:56.650
basically how to trust a server mm-hm
 

00:37:56.650 --> 00:37:59.220
basically how to trust a server mm-hm
is there any way to accomplish the

00:37:59.220 --> 00:37:59.230
is there any way to accomplish the
 

00:37:59.230 --> 00:38:02.130
is there any way to accomplish the
opposite direction how would a server

00:38:02.130 --> 00:38:02.140
opposite direction how would a server
 

00:38:02.140 --> 00:38:03.270
opposite direction how would a server
you want the server to trust the client

00:38:03.270 --> 00:38:03.280
you want the server to trust the client
 

00:38:03.280 --> 00:38:07.710
you want the server to trust the client
client you're in a very dangerous game

00:38:07.710 --> 00:38:07.720
client you're in a very dangerous game
 

00:38:07.720 --> 00:38:08.910
client you're in a very dangerous game
if you're trying to do that so I guess

00:38:08.910 --> 00:38:08.920
if you're trying to do that so I guess
 

00:38:08.920 --> 00:38:10.550
if you're trying to do that so I guess
the first question is why do you want

00:38:10.550 --> 00:38:10.560
the first question is why do you want
 

00:38:10.560 --> 00:38:13.140
the first question is why do you want
for instance if your web services aren't

00:38:13.140 --> 00:38:13.150
for instance if your web services aren't
 

00:38:13.150 --> 00:38:15.450
for instance if your web services aren't
intended to be public so for that client

00:38:15.450 --> 00:38:15.460
intended to be public so for that client
 

00:38:15.460 --> 00:38:18.359
intended to be public so for that client
certificates so you actually do have

00:38:18.359 --> 00:38:18.369
certificates so you actually do have
 

00:38:18.369 --> 00:38:19.800
certificates so you actually do have
this two-way thing so the server gives

00:38:19.800 --> 00:38:19.810
this two-way thing so the server gives
 

00:38:19.810 --> 00:38:21.240
this two-way thing so the server gives
you certificate and the client can as

00:38:21.240 --> 00:38:21.250
you certificate and the client can as
 

00:38:21.250 --> 00:38:23.700
you certificate and the client can as
well present itself a certificate so for

00:38:23.700 --> 00:38:23.710
well present itself a certificate so for
 

00:38:23.710 --> 00:38:26.190
well present itself a certificate so for
that sort of case a common example serve

00:38:26.190 --> 00:38:26.200
that sort of case a common example serve
 

00:38:26.200 --> 00:38:28.550
that sort of case a common example serve
the corporate case right so you your

00:38:28.550 --> 00:38:28.560
the corporate case right so you your
 

00:38:28.560 --> 00:38:31.349
the corporate case right so you your
your IT department issues clients if

00:38:31.349 --> 00:38:31.359
your IT department issues clients if
 

00:38:31.359 --> 00:38:32.910
your IT department issues clients if
they get to all your devices and then

00:38:32.910 --> 00:38:32.920
they get to all your devices and then
 

00:38:32.920 --> 00:38:34.320
they get to all your devices and then
when those devices connect to your

00:38:34.320 --> 00:38:34.330
when those devices connect to your
 

00:38:34.330 --> 00:38:36.420
when those devices connect to your
internal servers they present that so

00:38:36.420 --> 00:38:36.430
internal servers they present that so
 

00:38:36.430 --> 00:38:37.500
internal servers they present that so
that you know you can do that mutual

00:38:37.500 --> 00:38:37.510
that you know you can do that mutual
 

00:38:37.510 --> 00:38:40.440
that you know you can do that mutual
authentication yeah so that that is

00:38:40.440 --> 00:38:40.450
authentication yeah so that that is
 

00:38:40.450 --> 00:38:42.270
authentication yeah so that that is
supported by TLS and it's just a case of

00:38:42.270 --> 00:38:42.280
supported by TLS and it's just a case of
 

00:38:42.280 --> 00:38:43.890
supported by TLS and it's just a case of
getting those on the devices and that

00:38:43.890 --> 00:38:43.900
getting those on the devices and that
 

00:38:43.900 --> 00:38:48.030
getting those on the devices and that
kind of thing question over here in the

00:38:48.030 --> 00:38:48.040
kind of thing question over here in the
 

00:38:48.040 --> 00:38:51.420
kind of thing question over here in the
corner there's no one on this side I

00:38:51.420 --> 00:38:51.430
corner there's no one on this side I
 

00:38:51.430 --> 00:38:52.620
corner there's no one on this side I
can't actually see over here cuz the

00:38:52.620 --> 00:38:52.630
can't actually see over here cuz the
 

00:38:52.630 --> 00:38:54.359
can't actually see over here cuz the
lights are all right in my eyes none of

00:38:54.359 --> 00:38:54.369
lights are all right in my eyes none of
 

00:38:54.369 --> 00:38:58.440
lights are all right in my eyes none of
your questions sweet hi so you mentioned

00:38:58.440 --> 00:38:58.450
your questions sweet hi so you mentioned
 

00:38:58.450 --> 00:39:00.589
your questions sweet hi so you mentioned
about strictmode

00:39:00.589 --> 00:39:00.599
about strictmode
 

00:39:00.599 --> 00:39:02.910
about strictmode
so I just wanted to get a little bit

00:39:02.910 --> 00:39:02.920
so I just wanted to get a little bit
 

00:39:02.920 --> 00:39:05.750
so I just wanted to get a little bit
more context on strictmode versus a TLS

00:39:05.750 --> 00:39:05.760
more context on strictmode versus a TLS
 

00:39:05.760 --> 00:39:07.650
more context on strictmode versus a TLS
dependability that you're talking about

00:39:07.650 --> 00:39:07.660
dependability that you're talking about
 

00:39:07.660 --> 00:39:10.290
dependability that you're talking about
because it deals a lot with 2vm policies

00:39:10.290 --> 00:39:10.300
because it deals a lot with 2vm policies
 

00:39:10.300 --> 00:39:14.700
because it deals a lot with 2vm policies
and the thread policies right so it's

00:39:14.700 --> 00:39:14.710
and the thread policies right so it's
 

00:39:14.710 --> 00:39:15.870
and the thread policies right so it's
sort of the main difference between the

00:39:15.870 --> 00:39:15.880
sort of the main difference between the
 

00:39:15.880 --> 00:39:20.099
sort of the main difference between the
two is kind of accuracy and when you

00:39:20.099 --> 00:39:20.109
two is kind of accuracy and when you
 

00:39:20.109 --> 00:39:21.540
two is kind of accuracy and when you
should probably use them so the strict

00:39:21.540 --> 00:39:21.550
should probably use them so the strict
 

00:39:21.550 --> 00:39:22.770
should probably use them so the strict
mode detection is actually much more

00:39:22.770 --> 00:39:22.780
mode detection is actually much more
 

00:39:22.780 --> 00:39:26.310
mode detection is actually much more
heavy-handed it does IP level stuff but

00:39:26.310 --> 00:39:26.320
heavy-handed it does IP level stuff but
 

00:39:26.320 --> 00:39:28.109
heavy-handed it does IP level stuff but
it also has this issue of being false

00:39:28.109 --> 00:39:28.119
it also has this issue of being false
 

00:39:28.119 --> 00:39:29.910
it also has this issue of being false
positives and generally with strict mode

00:39:29.910 --> 00:39:29.920
positives and generally with strict mode
 

00:39:29.920 --> 00:39:31.890
positives and generally with strict mode
stuff you probably don't want to ship

00:39:31.890 --> 00:39:31.900
stuff you probably don't want to ship
 

00:39:31.900 --> 00:39:34.230
stuff you probably don't want to ship
with it on on like shipping out to users

00:39:34.230 --> 00:39:34.240
with it on on like shipping out to users
 

00:39:34.240 --> 00:39:36.000
with it on on like shipping out to users
because it does it breaks on things like

00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:36.010
because it does it breaks on things like
 

00:39:36.010 --> 00:39:38.310
because it does it breaks on things like
HTTP proxies the purpose of that

00:39:38.310 --> 00:39:38.320
HTTP proxies the purpose of that
 

00:39:38.320 --> 00:39:39.630
HTTP proxies the purpose of that
manifest flag on the other hand is

00:39:39.630 --> 00:39:39.640
manifest flag on the other hand is
 

00:39:39.640 --> 00:39:41.040
manifest flag on the other hand is
something that you can sort of safely

00:39:41.040 --> 00:39:41.050
something that you can sort of safely
 

00:39:41.050 --> 00:39:44.880
something that you can sort of safely
ship in your actual production builds to

00:39:44.880 --> 00:39:44.890
ship in your actual production builds to
 

00:39:44.890 --> 00:39:47.370
ship in your actual production builds to
users so it sort of just differs on that

00:39:47.370 --> 00:39:47.380
users so it sort of just differs on that
 

00:39:47.380 --> 00:39:50.010
users so it sort of just differs on that
front as far as the policy between like

00:39:50.010 --> 00:39:50.020
front as far as the policy between like
 

00:39:50.020 --> 00:39:53.700
front as far as the policy between like
thread and VM policy you would have to

00:39:53.700 --> 00:39:53.710
thread and VM policy you would have to
 

00:39:53.710 --> 00:39:55.320
thread and VM policy you would have to
ask Jeff Sharkey on the exact

00:39:55.320 --> 00:39:55.330
ask Jeff Sharkey on the exact
 

00:39:55.330 --> 00:39:56.970
ask Jeff Sharkey on the exact
implementation and he's talking later so

00:39:56.970 --> 00:39:56.980
implementation and he's talking later so
 

00:39:56.980 --> 00:40:00.230
implementation and he's talking later so
you should go ask him but I believe it

00:40:00.230 --> 00:40:00.240
you should go ask him but I believe it
 

00:40:00.240 --> 00:40:02.000
you should go ask him but I believe it
actually I don't know and on the

00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:02.010
actually I don't know and on the
 

00:40:02.010 --> 00:40:04.850
actually I don't know and on the
interplay between those two between the

00:40:04.850 --> 00:40:04.860
interplay between those two between the
 

00:40:04.860 --> 00:40:08.960
interplay between those two between the
VM and thread policy yeah ask him any

00:40:08.960 --> 00:40:08.970
VM and thread policy yeah ask him any
 

00:40:08.970 --> 00:40:13.720
VM and thread policy yeah ask him any
other questions

00:40:13.720 --> 00:40:13.730
 

00:40:13.730 --> 00:40:15.700
all right I think there's food and I'll

00:40:15.700 --> 00:40:15.710
all right I think there's food and I'll
 

00:40:15.710 --> 00:40:17.230
all right I think there's food and I'll
be hanging out around like the office

00:40:17.230 --> 00:40:17.240
be hanging out around like the office
 

00:40:17.240 --> 00:40:18.190
be hanging out around like the office
hours and stuff if you have more

00:40:18.190 --> 00:40:18.200
hours and stuff if you have more
 

00:40:18.200 --> 00:40:21.190
hours and stuff if you have more
questions so thank you all for coming
