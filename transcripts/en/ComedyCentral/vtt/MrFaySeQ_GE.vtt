- The Sandals Resort
in Russia looks

00:00:02.869 --> 00:00:05.638 align:start size:84% position:16%
way worse than it
did in the brochure.

00:00:05.638 --> 00:00:08.308
Nothin' better than bein'
barefoot on a gravel beach

00:00:08.308 --> 00:00:11.544
with your bros eating
live poisonous fish.

00:00:11.544 --> 00:00:14.514
(audience gasps)

00:00:14.514 --> 00:00:16.683 align:start size:88% position:13%
- It's like a Jell-O
shot from Mother Nature.

00:00:16.683 --> 00:00:17.884
(audience laughs)

00:00:17.884 --> 00:00:19.019 align:start size:84% position:16%
It's time to get
into swimsuit shape,

00:00:19.019 --> 00:00:20.520 align:start size:84% position:16%
and there's no
better way to do that

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:24.557 align:start size:97% position:3%
than by eating one pound of
rich, creamy, unsalted butter.

00:00:24.557 --> 00:00:25.792
- [Man] Here you go folks,

00:00:25.792 --> 00:00:29.029 align:start size:81% position:19%
one pound of grade
double-A butter

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.863
- Mmmm!

00:00:29.863 --> 00:00:30.730
(man laughs)

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:31.664
- Here we go.

00:00:31.664 --> 00:00:33.666
- [Man] Ready, three, two, one!

00:00:34.834 --> 00:00:38.271
(man shouts and laughs)

00:00:38.271 --> 00:00:40.373
- [Man] Come on, eat it.

00:00:40.373 --> 00:00:41.674
- Oh, yuck!

00:00:41.674 --> 00:00:44.310
(intense music)

00:00:50.517 --> 00:00:54.754
- The first half pound
is always the hardest.

00:00:54.754 --> 00:00:55.722
(woman laughs)

00:00:55.722 --> 00:00:56.956
(man groans)

00:00:56.956 --> 00:00:58.358 align:start size:88% position:13%
- One of the best things
about having a staff

00:00:58.358 --> 00:00:59.893 align:start size:94% position:6%
is makin' 'em do
whatever the hell I want.

00:00:59.893 --> 00:01:01.494 align:start size:84% position:16%
My favorite employee
to mess with

00:01:01.494 --> 00:01:02.996
is my tour manager, Andrew.

00:01:02.996 --> 00:01:04.297
I've been forcing him to eat

00:01:04.297 --> 00:01:07.767 align:start size:88% position:13%
unpleasant stuff on
camera all season long.

00:01:07.767 --> 00:01:10.036 line:0%

00:01:22.415 --> 00:01:23.550 line:0%
Don't stop until it's gone.

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:25.051 line:0%
Home stretch!

00:01:25.051 --> 00:01:29.322
- There's so much sugar and
then fake hazelnut flavor.

00:01:29.322 --> 00:01:31.057 line:0%
- This is duck jerky!

00:01:31.057 --> 00:01:32.792 line:0%
No, don't let Castro get it.

00:01:32.792 --> 00:01:35.295 line:0%
(employees laugh)

00:01:35.295 --> 00:01:38.231
- [Tosh] Oh god. This is what
I was tryin' to get him to do.

00:01:38.231 --> 00:01:39.933
- I don't wanna swallow this.

00:01:39.933 --> 00:01:40.800
- [Tosh] Come on.

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:42.302 line:0%
- [Andrew] What is it?

00:01:42.302 --> 00:01:44.070 align:start size:97% position:3% line:0%
- [Tosh] It's a fig nut press.
- Can I just try it first?

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:44.904 line:0%
- No, no, no.

00:01:44.904 --> 00:01:45.872 line:0%
Big huge bite of it in.

00:01:45.872 --> 00:01:46.673 line:0%
Okay.

00:01:47.707 --> 00:01:48.975 line:0%
(groans)

00:01:48.975 --> 00:01:50.543 line:0%

(audience laughs)

00:01:59.319 --> 00:02:00.820 align:start size:97% position:3% line:0%

(audience gasps and groans)

00:02:08.428 --> 00:02:10.597
- Oh!

00:02:10.597 --> 00:02:13.299
Alright, slow down!

00:02:13.299 --> 00:02:16.035
(audience laughs)

00:02:16.035 --> 00:02:17.937
- I'm gonna swallow it!

00:02:19.973 --> 00:02:23.476 align:start size:84% position:16%
That's the grossest

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:09.589
(laughter)

00:03:11.324 --> 00:03:12.258
- In the middle of that piece.

00:03:12.258 --> 00:03:13.860
Yeah, right in the middle there.

00:03:14.861 --> 00:03:17.130
(laughter)

00:03:18.531 --> 00:03:19.933
(coughs)

00:03:19.933 --> 00:03:21.367

(crowd gasps)

00:03:24.737 --> 00:03:26.005

(laughter)

00:03:27.173 --> 00:03:28.708 align:start size:84% position:16%
- And cutting
fruit is dangerous.

00:03:28.708 --> 00:03:29.943
That's why in my office,

00:03:29.943 --> 00:03:32.779
we have a strict new
no peeling policy.

00:03:32.779 --> 00:03:34.514 align:start size:84% position:16% line:0%
- [Tosh] She has
enormous teeth though.

00:03:34.514 --> 00:03:37.317
I think she's gonna have no
problem getting through this.

00:03:37.317 --> 00:03:40.153
(laughter)

00:03:40.153 --> 00:03:42.789
- Come on, dig it out.

00:03:42.789 --> 00:03:44.591 line:0%
- I don't think his teeth
are going to come out.

00:03:44.591 --> 00:03:45.658 line:0%

00:03:47.093 --> 00:03:48.428 line:0%

(laughter)

00:03:59.072 --> 00:04:00.573 align:start size:97% position:3%
- We also added coconut,
even though I firmly believe

00:04:00.573 --> 00:04:02.175
it's a nut, not a fruit.

00:04:02.175 --> 00:04:05.445
(screwdriver drilling)

00:04:09.349 --> 00:04:11.417
- What I like to do after
I finish full rotation,

00:04:11.417 --> 00:04:12.752
put it in reverse,

00:04:12.752 --> 00:04:14.153
catch the stragglers.

00:04:14.153 --> 00:04:15.488
(laughter)

00:04:15.488 --> 00:04:17.390
- Anne Hathaway can do
that in half the time.

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:18.691
(laughter)

00:04:18.691 --> 00:04:20.727
- Has like four rows
of teeth, I think.

00:04:20.727 --> 00:04:21.961
(laughter)

00:04:21.961 --> 00:04:22.895
- The faster you
eat your veggies,

00:04:22.895 --> 00:04:24.163
the sooner you can have dessert.

00:04:25.265 --> 00:04:26.866
(gadget moving)

00:04:26.866 --> 00:04:29.269
