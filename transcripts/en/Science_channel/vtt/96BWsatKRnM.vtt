Narrator: BACK AT THE SHOP,
IT'S ALMOST BATH TIME.

00:00:07.501 --> 00:00:08.801
Rachel: SO WE HAVE A PLAN.

00:00:08.801 --> 00:00:10.801
WE HAVE THE POOL,
WE HAVE THE SCALE,

00:00:10.801 --> 00:00:12.300
AND WE HAVE OUR LITTLE KLAUS.

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:13.868
SO THE FIRST THING
WE'RE GONNA DO

00:00:13.868 --> 00:00:15.501
IS WE'RE GONNA
WEIGH HIM NORMALLY.

00:00:15.501 --> 00:00:17.067
THEN WE'RE GONNA
GIVE HIM A BATH.

00:00:17.067 --> 00:00:21.934
Narrator: GETTING HIS DRY WEIGHT
OF 19.4 POUNDS IS THE EASY PART.

00:00:21.934 --> 00:00:24.000
NOW IT'S TIME TO GET WET.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.133
OH, NO, NO, NO, NO!
NOT TOO HIGH. NOT TOO HIGH.

00:00:26.133 --> 00:00:28.567
-OKAY.
-JUST RIGHT, RIGHT ON HIM.

00:00:28.567 --> 00:00:30.067
RIGHT THERE.
-THERE WE GO.

00:00:30.067 --> 00:00:33.868
Narrator:
WITH EIGHT DOGS AT HOME,
RACHEL'S GOT BATH TIME DOWN PAT.

00:00:33.868 --> 00:00:36.300
-OHH!
-ELIJAH, NOT SO MUCH.

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:39.000
YEAH, I HAVE NO DOGS,
I'M A CAT PERSON.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.601
WELL, I LIKE CATS. I'M NOT,
LIKE, I'M NOT A FURRY.

00:00:43.601 --> 00:00:47.100
Narrator:
EVERY FIBER OF THIS FURRY FRAME
WANTS TO SHIMMY

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:48.334
FROM NOSE TO TAIL.

00:00:48.334 --> 00:00:50.734
THE HARDEST PART WAS NOT GETTING
THE DOGS TO SHAKE.

00:00:50.734 --> 00:00:52.834
BECAUSE THAT'S ALL THEY WANT TO
DO IS SHAKE.

00:00:52.834 --> 00:00:57.667
ELIJAH GRABS A READING
OF 20.4 POUNDS.

00:00:57.667 --> 00:00:59.267
NOT A SECOND TOO SOON.

00:00:59.267 --> 00:01:02.868
THAT WAS ALL UP IN MY FACE.

00:01:02.868 --> 00:01:05.734
Narrator:
THEN IT'S BACK ON THE SCALE
FOR THOSE VITAL

00:01:05.734 --> 00:01:06.934
POST-SHAKE PARTICULARS.

00:01:06.934 --> 00:01:09.601
TWENTY POINT ONE POUNDS.

00:01:09.601 --> 00:01:11.334
YAY!

00:01:11.334 --> 00:01:13.400
GOOD BOY, KLAUS.

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:15.901
Narrator: POINT THREE OF A POUND
DOESN'T SOUND LIKE MUCH,

00:01:15.901 --> 00:01:18.801
BUT MATH GENIUS AND COLLEGE
SOPHOMORE CANNAN

00:01:18.801 --> 00:01:22.868
SOON CONFIRMS THAT THE MYTH IS
OFF TO A PROMISING START.

00:01:22.868 --> 00:01:26.400
THE RESULTS ARE THAT KLAUS LOST
ABOUT 60% OF HIS WATER WEIGHT

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.000
IN ONE SHAKE CYCLE.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.334
Rachel: IT'S NOT 70%,
BUT IT'S STILL VERY IMPRESSIVE.

00:01:31.334 --> 00:01:33.434
Narrator: IMPRESSIVE ENOUGH
FOR ELIJAH TO PROPOSE

00:01:33.434 --> 00:01:37.000
HIS "PET" THEORY
OF COMPARATIVE SPECIES SHAKING.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.234
WE'RE GONNA TEST TO SEE IF
HUMANS CAN SHAKE WATER

00:01:39.234 --> 00:01:40.901
OUT OF THEIR HAIR,
JUST LIKE DOGS CAN

00:01:40.901 --> 00:01:43.501
SHAKE WATER OUT OF THEIR FUR.

00:01:43.501 --> 00:01:45.767
Narrator: NO PRIZES
FOR GUESSING WHICH HUMAN.

00:01:45.767 --> 00:01:49.367
JUST LIKE KLAUS,
ELIJAH FIRST GETS WEIGHED DRY,

00:01:49.367 --> 00:01:50.968
THEN IT'S DUNK TIME.

00:01:50.968 --> 00:01:54.934
IN THREE, TWO, ONE.
GO. DOWN.

GO!
-OH.

00:02:03.334 --> 00:02:06.400
Narrator: ELIJAH'S NOW WEIGHED
WITH HIS MANE RINGING WET.

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:07.868
AND THEN...

00:02:07.868 --> 00:02:09.634

ELIJAH.
E-ELIJAH.

[ LAUGHS ]

00:02:16.467 --> 00:02:20.434
Narrator: SO, LET'S GET THE DATA
ON DUDE VERSUS DOG.

00:02:20.434 --> 00:02:23.701
Elijah: I GAINED 0.7 POUNDS
AFTER MY HAIR WAS SOAKED

00:02:23.701 --> 00:02:27.067
AND I LOST 0.2 POUNDS WHEN I,
LIKE, SHOOK OUT MY HAIR.

00:02:27.067 --> 00:02:31.200
OKAY. MATH MAN,
WHAT IS THAT IN PERCENTAGE?

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:35.501
THAT IS 28.5% OF THE WATER LOST.

00:02:35.501 --> 00:02:37.367
Narrator: NOT TOO SHABBY.

00:02:37.367 --> 00:02:39.133
STILL NO MATCH FOR KLAUS.

00:02:39.133 --> 00:02:41.200
BUT TO GIVE THIS MYTH
A FAIR SHAKE,

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:43.467
THEY'LL NEED A MUCH BIGGER
SAMPLE SIZE.
