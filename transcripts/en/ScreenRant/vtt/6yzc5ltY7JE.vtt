00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.480
Fans go crazy for a good superhero movie.

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:10.240
For years, characters and stories from the
pages of Marvel, DC, Dark Horse, Image and

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:13.510
many more comic book companies have been gracing
the big screen.The genre is so unique and

00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:14.510
varied that it can include moments of amazing
action, side-splitting hilarity, raw sexiness,

00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:15.510
endless references to other superheroes and
much, much more - and that results in viewers

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:19.310
keeping a very close eye on the movies within
it.In turn, that can result in a lot of pausing.

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:23.480
Whether it's to marvel at something spectacular,
bask in the beauty of a particular character,

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:27.850
or spot a fun Easter egg, fans are constantly
revelling in certain moments in superhero

00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:30.260
movies - and that's what this video is all
about.

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:38.850
Here are the ten most paused scenes in popular
superhero movies.

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:42.940
The Train Scene in Spider-Man 2
We begin our list with a funny entry.

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:47.469
2004's Spider-Man 2 remains one of the most
faithful and outright best comic book movies

00:00:47.469 --> 00:00:48.469
to date.

00:00:48.469 --> 00:00:52.440
Tobey Maguire shone in his best performance
as the titular hero, while Alfred Molina gave

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:56.149
one of the best villain performances of all
time in a superhero movie - and it's a scene

00:00:56.149 --> 00:00:59.860
involving them both that we're referring to
here.Molina's Doctor Octopus had sabotaged

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:03.949
the controls of a train, leaving it unable
to break and Spider-Man to save the passengers.

00:01:03.949 --> 00:01:07.890
Using his webbing and all of his strength,
Spidey saved the day - but the strained faces

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:12.610
Tobey Maguire was making were hilarious and
people loved pausing on them to have a good

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:16.000
laugh.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.040
Naked Mystique in X-Men: The Last Stand
Prior to Jennifer Lawrence taking over the

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:24.400
role in the new X-Men movie timeline, the
equally sexy Rebecca Romijn played Mystique

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:25.400
in the franchise.

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:28.920
She looked incredible in the the blue make-up
that created the character's look - but it's

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:33.150
a scene without said make-up that is one of
the most paused in superhero movie history.In

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:38.549
2006's X-Men: The Last Stand, Romijn's Mystique
is injected with the mutant "cure", resulting

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:40.200
in her blue skin disappearing.

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:44.119
This left the character looking completely
human - and completely naked.

00:01:44.119 --> 00:01:48.170
Viewers around the world looked on in awe
as Romijn laid on the ground in her birthday

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:55.110
suit - and they paused en masse to get a better
look.

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:58.791
Captain America's Shield in Iron Man
These days, seeing Captain America's shield

00:01:58.791 --> 00:02:02.360
in the Marvel Cinematic Universe is no big
deal - Captain America had his first solo

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:06.360
movie five years ago and Chris Evans has become
a prominent part of the franchise as the super

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:11.060
soldier since then - but back in 2008 he hadn't
even been mentioned.That changed in Iron Man,

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:14.840
when a partially completed replica of the
shield was seen in Tony Stark's laboratory,

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:17.310
resulting in lots of pausing on the part of
the viewer.

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:21.310
It should also be noted that Captain America
could be seen under the ice in a deleted scene

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:25.470
in The Incredible Hulk later that year - something
a lot of people have pressed pause on since

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:28.959
it was made public.

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:33.650
"Thor" in The Incredible Hulk
Prior to Captain America's first appearance

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:37.510
in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, the next
Avenger to follow Iron Man and the Hulk into

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:40.730
the franchise was Thor in his 2011 solo movie.

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:45.280
This resulting in some retrospective pausing
of a scene in 2008's The Incredible Hulk,

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:48.880
when viewers thought they saw Thor making
a brief cameo.It came in the scene when the

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:52.250
Hulk and Betty Ross are in a cave and there's
a thunderstorm going on.

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:56.170
Viewers thought the storm was caused by the
God of Thunder's arrival on Earth and swore

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:59.010
blind that they saw him fall to the ground
in the background.

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:03.310
Of course, they turned out to be wrong, but
a lot of pausing went on when people believed

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:08.069
they had seen him.

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:12.330
Nite Owl and Silk Spectre in Watchmen
As with the audiences of any movie genre,

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:15.510
comic book movie viewers love a good sex scene
- and they were treated to one of the more

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:18.250
revealing examples in comic book movie history
in 2009's Watchmen.

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:19.250
The scene in question was a sex scene between
Patrick Wilson's Daniel Dreiberg AKA Nite

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:20.680
Owl II and Malin Åkerman's Laurie Juspeczyk
AKA Silk Spectre II.It happens on board Dreiberg's

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:24.239
Owlship and Åkerman's breasts were completely
exposed for the scene.

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:27.270
Of course, this resulted in a hell of a lot
of pause buttons being pressed around the

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:33.159
world, as viewers honed in for a better look.

00:03:33.159 --> 00:03:36.910
Scarlett Johansson's Face in The Avengers
It's always comforting to find out that even

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:40.330
the most beautiful people can be caught off
guard looking less than attractive, so when

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:44.340
that happened to the gorgeous Scarlett Johansson
in 2012's The Avengers, a lot of people were

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:47.799
eager to see - especially her fellow females!Johansson's
Black Widow was caught looking a lot... well...

00:03:47.799 --> 00:03:51.830
uglier than usual in the scene in which she
commandeered a Chitauri aircraft.

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:55.270
As she went to cut a cord holding a Chitauri
henchman in place, she made a face that only

00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:56.409
her mother could love!

00:03:56.409 --> 00:03:59.879
It's a scene that has been paused many times
- and been used in countless memes - ever

00:03:59.879 --> 00:04:03.000
since it was first seen.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:07.159
The Collector's Collection in Guardians of
the Galaxy

00:04:07.159 --> 00:04:12.120
Superhero movie fans love a good Easter egg
and, these days, spend just as much time looking

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:15.689
for them as they do enjoying the plot of the
movie - and the most Easter egg-rich scene

00:04:15.689 --> 00:04:19.900
in comic book movie history came in 2014's
Guardians of the Galaxy.The scene we're referring

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:22.830
to is, of course, the one in The Collector's
museum on Knowhere.

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:26.910
Benicio del Toro's character owned a lot of
interesting species and items - and eagle-eyed

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:30.090
viewers loved spotting them, which resulted
in a lot of pausing.

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:34.500
The likes of Howard the Duck, Adam Warlock's
cocoon, a Dark Elf and the slug creatures

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:40.970
from Slither are just some of the things that
could be seen in there.

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:43.910
The Avengers Jump Into Action in Avengers:
Age of Ultron

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:48.780
At the start of 2015's Avengers: Age of Ultron,
there was an epic scene in which the six original

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:53.100
members of the titular team storm Baron Strucker's
HYDRA base to retrieve the scepter that was

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:57.400
previously wielded by Loki in the first Avengers
movie.As the team cut through Strucker's forces

00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:01.840
like a hot knife through butter, there's one
epic moment in which they all jump into shot

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:05.750
together - and it's a shot that prompted the
use of millions of pause buttons around the

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:06.750
world.

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:11.240
Iron Man is flying, Captain America is on
a motorcyle and Thor, Hawkeye, Black Widow

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:15.690
and Hulk are all leaping - it looks awesome.

00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:23.520
"The Wasp" in Ant-Man
In 2015's Ant-Man, viewers learned that Janet

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:28.210
van Dyne - the original Wasp - disappeared
into the subatomic quantum realm while disabling

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:32.199
a Soviet nuclear missile many years before
the events of the movie.At the end of the

00:05:32.199 --> 00:05:36.770
movie, Paul Rudd's Scott Lang also had to
go subatomic to defeat Corey Stoll's Yellowjacket

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:40.630
- and viewers noticed something very interesting
while he was in the quantum realm.

00:05:40.630 --> 00:05:44.580
It was an outline that looked very much like
the original Wasp - prompting lots of viewers

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:52.830
to hit pause to make their own assumptions
about whether or not it was really her.

00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:57.780
Harley Quinn Getting Dressed in Suicide Squad
2016's Suicide Squad received very mixed reviews

00:05:57.780 --> 00:06:01.400
from critics and fans alike - but one thing
everyone can agree on is that Margot Robbie

00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:03.090
looked absolutely incredible.

00:06:03.090 --> 00:06:06.520
With that in mind, this particular entry in
our most-paused moments list should come as

00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:10.220
no surprise.It's the scene in which Harley
gets changed into her costume and a large

00:06:10.220 --> 00:06:12.060
group of men watch on in awe.

00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:15.940
The camera pans all the way up her body and
just about catches a glimpse of her bra as

00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:18.180
she pulls her top down over her torso.

00:06:18.180 --> 00:06:22.750
Men around the world - and indeed some women
- paused that scene over and over and over

00:06:22.750 --> 00:06:25.970
and over again.

00:06:25.970 --> 00:06:29.660
