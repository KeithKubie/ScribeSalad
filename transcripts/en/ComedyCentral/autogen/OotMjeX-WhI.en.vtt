whose pasture I climbed into because I
 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.490
whose pasture I climbed into because I
thought it would bring us closer

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500
thought it would bring us closer
 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:25.639

thing I knew about horses when I met her
 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.100
thing I knew about horses when I met her
is that I thought that they liked

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110
is that I thought that they liked
 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:44.630
is that I thought that they liked
carrots and apples and so I met her

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640
carrots and apples and so I met her
 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.760
carrots and apples and so I met her
because I had moved back to Austin in

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770
because I had moved back to Austin in
 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:49.760
because I had moved back to Austin in
2012 and I lived in a part of the city

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770
2012 and I lived in a part of the city
 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:51.620
2012 and I lived in a part of the city
that was almost out in the country and

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630
that was almost out in the country and
 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:53.359
that was almost out in the country and
there were a few places that had horses

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369
there were a few places that had horses
 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:55.669
there were a few places that had horses
and one day when I was walking my dog

00:01:55.669 --> 00:01:55.679
and one day when I was walking my dog
 

00:01:55.679 --> 00:01:58.910
and one day when I was walking my dog
this horse came to her fence and she

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920
this horse came to her fence and she
 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:00.800
this horse came to her fence and she
walked the whole length of her fence

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810
walked the whole length of her fence
 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:03.620
walked the whole length of her fence
along with us and then when we were on

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630
along with us and then when we were on
 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:05.240
along with us and then when we were on
our way back she did the same thing in

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250
our way back she did the same thing in
 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:07.399
our way back she did the same thing in
the other direction and she started

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409
the other direction and she started
 

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:09.319
the other direction and she started
doing that every day and I never saw any

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:09.329
doing that every day and I never saw any
 

00:02:09.329 --> 00:02:12.500
doing that every day and I never saw any
people in her pasture so I thought that

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510
people in her pasture so I thought that
 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:15.289
people in her pasture so I thought that
she probably wanted me to go pet her

00:02:15.289 --> 00:02:15.299
she probably wanted me to go pet her
 

00:02:15.299 --> 00:02:21.080
she probably wanted me to go pet her
because I thought I thought I had heard

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:21.090
because I thought I thought I had heard
 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:24.759
because I thought I thought I had heard
that horses are like really big dogs but

00:02:24.759 --> 00:02:24.769
that horses are like really big dogs but
 

00:02:24.769 --> 00:02:29.420
that horses are like really big dogs but
I honestly believe that when people say

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:29.430
I honestly believe that when people say
 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:31.460
I honestly believe that when people say
that if someone says that it's because

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:31.470
that if someone says that it's because
 

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:34.460
that if someone says that it's because
they were dealing with a big dog that

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:34.470
they were dealing with a big dog that
 

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:37.610
they were dealing with a big dog that
they thought was a horse because they're

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:37.620
they thought was a horse because they're
 

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:42.860
they thought was a horse because they're
not anything like dogs and I finally I

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:42.870
not anything like dogs and I finally I
 

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:44.870
not anything like dogs and I finally I
went to pet her and at first she would

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:44.880
went to pet her and at first she would
 

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:46.729
went to pet her and at first she would
kind of back away and then she finally

00:02:46.729 --> 00:02:46.739
kind of back away and then she finally
 

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:48.949
kind of back away and then she finally
let me pet her and there were some early

00:02:48.949 --> 00:02:48.959
let me pet her and there were some early
 

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:51.440
let me pet her and there were some early
signs that there might be trouble down

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:51.450
signs that there might be trouble down
 

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:53.890

the road

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:53.900

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:57.430
the road
did a couple times look like she was

00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:57.440

gonna try to bite my hand and then one

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:01.190
gonna try to bite my hand and then one
 

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:03.250
gonna try to bite my hand and then one
time on my two I turned my back on her

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:03.260
time on my two I turned my back on her
 

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:05.619
time on my two I turned my back on her
and she grabbed my ponytail and pulled

00:03:05.619 --> 00:03:05.629
and she grabbed my ponytail and pulled
 

00:03:05.629 --> 00:03:10.899
and she grabbed my ponytail and pulled
it really hard but I thought that that

00:03:10.899 --> 00:03:10.909
it really hard but I thought that that
 

00:03:10.909 --> 00:03:15.509
it really hard but I thought that that
was like maybe how horses play and I

00:03:15.509 --> 00:03:15.519
was like maybe how horses play and I
 

00:03:15.519 --> 00:03:19.119

ran behind another tree closer to the
 

00:09:26.020 --> 00:09:31.230
ran behind another tree closer to the
fence and then the last the that was the

00:09:31.230 --> 00:09:31.240
fence and then the last the that was the
 

00:09:31.240 --> 00:09:33.570
fence and then the last the that was the
last tree that you know was the closest

00:09:33.570 --> 00:09:33.580
last tree that you know was the closest
 

00:09:33.580 --> 00:09:35.280
