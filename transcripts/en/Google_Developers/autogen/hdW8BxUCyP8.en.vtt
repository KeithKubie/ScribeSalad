the Google Maps JavaScript API in the

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:21.220
the Google Maps JavaScript API in the
 

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:23.580
the Google Maps JavaScript API in the
last video I covered adding an API key

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:23.590
last video I covered adding an API key
 

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:26.159
last video I covered adding an API key
to your Google Maps API loader and the

00:00:26.159 --> 00:00:26.169
to your Google Maps API loader and the
 

00:00:26.169 --> 00:00:27.720
to your Google Maps API loader and the
various parameters that the loader takes

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:27.730
various parameters that the loader takes
 

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:30.570
various parameters that the loader takes
in this video I'll cover the basics of

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:30.580
in this video I'll cover the basics of
 

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:33.420
in this video I'll cover the basics of
map options and getting your Maps to

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:33.430
map options and getting your Maps to
 

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:35.220
map options and getting your Maps to
render on a page if you've been

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:39.180
following along with this video series
you have a text document with this code

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:39.190
you have a text document with this code
 

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:43.290
you have a text document with this code
in it as we walk through this basic HTML

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:43.300
in it as we walk through this basic HTML
 

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:45.120
in it as we walk through this basic HTML
page you'll see the basic declaration of

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:45.130
page you'll see the basic declaration of
 

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:47.430
page you'll see the basic declaration of
elements the first thing I want to point

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:47.440
elements the first thing I want to point
 

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:49.410
elements the first thing I want to point
out is the style element one of the most

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:49.420
out is the style element one of the most
 

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:51.420
out is the style element one of the most
common mistakes that developers make is

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:51.430
common mistakes that developers make is
 

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:54.660
common mistakes that developers make is
to not specify the size of the div that

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:54.670
to not specify the size of the div that
 

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:57.450
to not specify the size of the div that
contains the map if you don't declare a

00:00:57.450 --> 00:00:57.460
contains the map if you don't declare a
 

00:00:57.460 --> 00:00:59.910
contains the map if you don't declare a
size for the div them when the map is

00:00:59.910 --> 00:00:59.920
size for the div them when the map is
 

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:02.190
size for the div them when the map is
created it will be created but it will

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:02.200
created it will be created but it will
 

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:06.030
created it will be created but it will
be invisible because the div is 0 this

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:06.040
be invisible because the div is 0 this
 

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:07.859
be invisible because the div is 0 this

in this sample we put the style inline

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:14.770
in this sample we put the style inline
 

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:17.730
in this sample we put the style inline
with the page in most cases however you

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:17.740
with the page in most cases however you
 

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:19.260
with the page in most cases however you
would like to link to a separate file

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:19.270
would like to link to a separate file
 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:21.270
would like to link to a separate file
containing your style sheets for ease of

thing you see is the script tag that

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:25.840
thing you see is the script tag that
 

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:28.139
thing you see is the script tag that
loads the Maps API I covered that in the

00:01:28.139 --> 00:01:28.149
loads the Maps API I covered that in the
 

00:01:28.149 --> 00:01:30.450
loads the Maps API I covered that in the
last video next we see the JavaScript

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:30.460
last video next we see the JavaScript
 

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:32.760
last video next we see the JavaScript
that adds the map to the page you'll see

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:32.770
that adds the map to the page you'll see
 

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:34.980
that adds the map to the page you'll see
we declared the map variable as a global

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:34.990
we declared the map variable as a global
 

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:37.020
we declared the map variable as a global
variable that's in case you need it for

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:37.030
variable that's in case you need it for
 

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:39.330
variable that's in case you need it for
other functions next there's an

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:39.340
other functions next there's an
 

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:41.429
other functions next there's an
initialize function this is where we

00:01:41.429 --> 00:01:41.439
initialize function this is where we
 

00:01:41.439 --> 00:01:42.899
initialize function this is where we
actually create the map and assign it to

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:42.909
actually create the map and assign it to
 

00:01:42.909 --> 00:01:44.969
actually create the map and assign it to
a particular div in the initialize

00:01:44.969 --> 00:01:44.979
a particular div in the initialize
 

00:01:44.979 --> 00:01:46.859
a particular div in the initialize
function the first thing we do is create

00:01:46.859 --> 00:01:46.869
function the first thing we do is create
 

00:01:46.869 --> 00:01:50.010
function the first thing we do is create
a map options object there are two

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:50.020
a map options object there are two
 

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:51.959
a map options object there are two
required properties that for a map

00:01:51.959 --> 00:01:51.969
required properties that for a map
 

00:01:51.969 --> 00:01:55.219
required properties that for a map
options object they are zoom and center

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229
options object they are zoom and center
 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:57.569
options object they are zoom and center
so let me cover it in the first video in

00:01:57.569 --> 00:01:57.579
so let me cover it in the first video in
 

00:01:57.579 --> 00:02:00.029
so let me cover it in the first video in
the series as a reminder zoom 0 is

00:02:00.029 --> 00:02:00.039
the series as a reminder zoom 0 is
 

00:02:00.039 --> 00:02:02.730
the series as a reminder zoom 0 is
zoomed way out showing the map of the

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:02.740
zoomed way out showing the map of the
 

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:04.800
zoomed way out showing the map of the
whole earth hi zoom levels get you close

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:04.810
whole earth hi zoom levels get you close
 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:07.830
whole earth hi zoom levels get you close
to the map and show more detail we also

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:07.840
to the map and show more detail we also
 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:09.570
to the map and show more detail we also
talked briefly about Center in the first

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:09.580
talked briefly about Center in the first
 

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:12.510
talked briefly about Center in the first
video but as a reminder it sets the

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:12.520
video but as a reminder it sets the
 

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:16.830
video but as a reminder it sets the
center of the map as a lot long object a

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:16.840
center of the map as a lot long object a
 

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:18.990
center of the map as a lot long object a
Google Maps long object has two

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:19.000
Google Maps long object has two
 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:20.440
Google Maps long object has two
properties latitude

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:20.450
properties latitude
 

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:23.630

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:23.640
naturally you'll see loading objects
 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:26.720
naturally you'll see loading objects
