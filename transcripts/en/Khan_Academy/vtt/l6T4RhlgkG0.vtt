00:00:00.452 --> 00:00:02.170
- [Voiceover] The result
that I hope to show you,

00:00:02.170 --> 00:00:04.104
or you give you an
intuition for, in this video

00:00:04.104 --> 00:00:06.001
is something that we will use

00:00:06.001 --> 00:00:08.102
in the proof of the chain rule,

00:00:08.102 --> 00:00:09.569
or in a proof of the chain rule actually.

00:00:09.569 --> 00:00:13.307
We may do more than
proof of the chain rule.

00:00:13.307 --> 00:00:14.886
But the result we're gonna look at

00:00:14.886 --> 00:00:16.929
is if we have some function u

00:00:16.929 --> 00:00:18.474
which is a function of x,

00:00:18.474 --> 00:00:22.188
and we know that it is continuous

00:00:23.871 --> 00:00:26.729
at x equals c,

00:00:26.729 --> 00:00:30.084
so if we know this, then
that's going to imply

00:00:30.084 --> 00:00:34.159
that the change in u goes

00:00:34.159 --> 00:00:39.114
to zero as our change in x in this region

00:00:39.114 --> 00:00:41.424
around c goes to zero.

00:00:41.424 --> 00:00:43.351
This is what I want to
get an intuition for.

00:00:43.351 --> 00:00:45.686
That if u is continuous at c,

00:00:45.686 --> 00:00:48.667
then as our change in x around c

00:00:48.667 --> 00:00:51.745
gets smaller, and smaller, and smaller

00:00:51.745 --> 00:00:54.566
as it approaches zero,
then our change in u

00:00:54.566 --> 00:00:57.110
approaches zero as well.

00:00:58.296 --> 00:01:00.282
To think about this, or
to even kind of prove it

00:01:00.282 --> 00:01:03.450
to ourselves a little bit more rigorously,

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:04.785
let's think about what it means

00:01:04.785 --> 00:01:07.409
to be continuous at x equals c.

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:10.984
Well the definition of continuity is,

00:01:10.984 --> 00:01:14.003
so this literally is
the same thing as saying

00:01:14.003 --> 00:01:18.297
that the limit as x approaches c

00:01:18.297 --> 00:01:23.104
of u of x is equal to u of c.

00:01:23.104 --> 00:01:26.215
The limit that our function approaches

00:01:26.215 --> 00:01:27.556
as x approaches c is equal

00:01:27.556 --> 00:01:29.408
to the value of the function at c.

00:01:29.408 --> 00:01:31.811
We don't have a point discontinuity

00:01:31.811 --> 00:01:33.471
or a jump discontinuity.

00:01:33.471 --> 00:01:34.574
If we had a jump discontinuity,

00:01:34.574 --> 00:01:35.932
then the limit wouldn't exist,

00:01:35.932 --> 00:01:38.231
and we've seen that in previous videos.

00:01:38.231 --> 00:01:40.750
Now I'm just gonna
manipulate this algebraically

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:43.108
so it essentially gives us this conclusion

00:01:43.108 --> 00:01:44.732
right over here.

00:01:44.732 --> 00:01:46.752
So this we can rewrite.

00:01:46.752 --> 00:01:48.389
It's important to realize that u of c,

00:01:48.389 --> 00:01:50.003
this is just going to be some value.

00:01:50.003 --> 00:01:53.207
It looks like maybe this is a function

00:01:53.207 --> 00:01:54.251
of x or something, but no,

00:01:54.251 --> 00:01:55.970
this is just going to be some value.

00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:57.769
I've inputted c here and I've evaluated

00:01:57.769 --> 00:01:59.267
the function of that, and so this is going

00:01:59.267 --> 00:01:59.864
to be some number.

00:01:59.864 --> 00:02:01.719
It could be five, or seven, or pi,

00:02:01.719 --> 00:02:03.947
or negative one, but it's just going

00:02:03.947 --> 00:02:06.878
to be some value, some constant.

00:02:06.878 --> 00:02:08.796
So I can treat it like a constant.

00:02:08.796 --> 00:02:10.408
So this is going to be the same thing

00:02:10.408 --> 00:02:14.386
as saying the limit as x

00:02:14.386 --> 00:02:19.188
approaches c of u of x

00:02:19.188 --> 00:02:21.547
minus u of c

00:02:21.547 --> 00:02:24.101
is equal to zero.

00:02:24.101 --> 00:02:26.028
And actually, in the video where we prove

00:02:26.028 --> 00:02:28.501
that differentiability implies continuity,

00:02:28.501 --> 00:02:31.764
we started with this and we proved

00:02:31.764 --> 00:02:32.622
that right over there.

00:02:32.622 --> 00:02:35.048
We show that these two
are equivalent things.

00:02:35.048 --> 00:02:36.036
But hopefully you could even think

00:02:36.036 --> 00:02:36.656
about the intuition.

00:02:36.656 --> 00:02:41.462
This is just if the limit of u of x

00:02:41.462 --> 00:02:43.564
is x approaches c is equal to this,

00:02:43.564 --> 00:02:45.468
then when you evaluate this limit,

00:02:45.468 --> 00:02:46.966
the limit is x approaches c,

00:02:46.966 --> 00:02:50.611
well this thing is going
to approach u of c,

00:02:50.611 --> 00:02:51.892
because we saw it right up here,

00:02:51.892 --> 00:02:53.831
u of c minus u of c is indeed

00:02:53.831 --> 00:02:55.758
going to be equal to zero.

00:02:55.758 --> 00:02:57.871
So hopefully you don't
feel like it's too much

00:02:57.871 --> 00:02:59.810
of a stretch, and you can just subtract

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:02.016
u of c from both sides
and apply properties

00:03:02.016 --> 00:03:05.429
of limits, and you can
get this result as well.

00:03:05.429 --> 00:03:07.750
But this is interesting
because this essentially

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:09.955
can take us to this,

00:03:09.955 --> 00:03:11.483
the idea that as our change in x

00:03:11.483 --> 00:03:13.285
gets smaller, and smaller, and smaller

00:03:13.285 --> 00:03:15.723
as it approaches zero, then our change

00:03:15.723 --> 00:03:18.627
in our function is also
going to approach zero.

00:03:18.627 --> 00:03:22.085
Now let's just graph
this or visualize this

00:03:22.085 --> 00:03:24.152
to get a sense of that.

00:03:24.152 --> 00:03:29.152
So this is our x axis.

00:03:29.512 --> 00:03:30.676
Woops.

00:03:30.676 --> 00:03:32.475
That's our x axis.

00:03:32.475 --> 00:03:35.578
Let's call that our u axis maybe.

00:03:35.578 --> 00:03:36.925
And I did u intentionally because

00:03:36.925 --> 00:03:38.121
that's the variable we'll use

00:03:38.121 --> 00:03:41.766
in our proof of the chain rule video.

00:03:41.766 --> 00:03:43.067
Let's say this right over here

00:03:43.067 --> 00:03:44.892
is our function.

00:03:45.318 --> 00:03:47.626
Let's say this right over here,

00:03:47.626 --> 00:03:50.089
that is c.

00:03:50.089 --> 00:03:52.889
This right over here is u of c.

00:03:54.011 --> 00:03:56.521
U of c.

00:03:56.521 --> 00:04:00.734
Then let's just take some
arbitrary x over here.

00:04:01.115 --> 00:04:03.429
So some arbitrary x,

00:04:03.429 --> 00:04:07.949
and then this right over here is u of x.

00:04:11.787 --> 00:04:15.577
So if we define our change,

00:04:16.499 --> 00:04:17.225
let me do this.

00:04:17.225 --> 00:04:21.295
If we define our change in u is equal

00:04:21.295 --> 00:04:23.396
to u of x minus u of c,

00:04:23.396 --> 00:04:24.569
which makes sense because this

00:04:24.569 --> 00:04:27.790
is our change in u.

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:31.206
So let's say this is going to be u of x

00:04:31.206 --> 00:04:34.246
minus u of c.

00:04:34.246 --> 00:04:38.392
If we define our change in x

00:04:38.392 --> 00:04:40.043
is equal to x minus c,

00:04:40.043 --> 00:04:41.098
which it is in this case,

00:04:41.098 --> 00:04:43.492
it is x minus c,

00:04:46.504 --> 00:04:48.580
then we can rewrite this limit

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:49.527
right over here.

00:04:49.527 --> 00:04:52.568
Instead of saying the
limit as x approaches c,

00:04:52.568 --> 00:04:55.192
we could write the limit as delta x

00:04:55.192 --> 00:04:58.372
approaches zero, because
if x approaches c,

00:04:58.372 --> 00:05:01.090
then delta x is going to approach zero.

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:02.668
So we could write this the limit

00:05:02.668 --> 00:05:07.640
as delta x approaches zero of delta u

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:12.202
is going to be equal to zero.

00:05:12.202 --> 00:05:13.549
We define this as our change in u,

00:05:13.549 --> 00:05:15.104
and it is our change in u.

00:05:15.104 --> 00:05:18.005
So this is equal to zero.

00:05:18.005 --> 00:05:19.979
So another way of thinking about this

00:05:19.979 --> 00:05:23.648
is as delta x approaches zero,

00:05:23.648 --> 00:05:25.679
our change in u, our
change in the function,

00:05:25.679 --> 00:05:27.340
is going to approach zero.

00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:32.340
So as delta x approaches zero,

00:05:35.423 --> 00:05:38.702
delta u approaches zero.

00:05:38.702 --> 00:05:39.742
That's what we wrote over here.

00:05:39.742 --> 00:05:41.425
Delta u approaches zero

00:05:41.425 --> 00:05:43.200
as delta x approaches zero.

00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:47.124
In a lot of ways, this is
hopefully common sense.

00:05:47.124 --> 00:05:49.040
We're dealing with a continuous function.

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:50.598
As you get smaller and smaller,

00:05:50.598 --> 00:05:51.639
and you can just think of it this way,

00:05:51.639 --> 00:05:54.357
as you get smaller and
smaller changes in x's,

00:05:54.357 --> 00:05:56.759
as our change in x gets smaller,

00:05:56.759 --> 00:05:58.937
and smaller, and smaller, and smaller,

00:05:58.937 --> 00:06:00.375
well it's because it's continuous.

00:06:00.375 --> 00:06:00.982
You wouldn't be able to say this

00:06:00.982 --> 00:06:02.677
for a discontinuous function,

00:06:02.677 --> 00:06:04.177
but because it's continuous,

00:06:04.177 --> 00:06:05.094
or you wouldn't be able to say this

00:06:05.094 --> 00:06:07.962
for some discontinuous functions,

00:06:07.962 --> 00:06:09.621
as our change in x gets smaller,

00:06:09.621 --> 00:06:11.014
and smaller, and smaller,

00:06:11.014 --> 00:06:13.104
then our change in u is
going to get smaller,

00:06:13.104 --> 00:06:14.057
and smaller, and smaller.

00:06:14.057 --> 00:06:15.317
So it makes intuitive sense,

00:06:15.317 --> 00:06:16.338
but hopefully this makes you feel

00:06:16.338 --> 00:06:18.013
even better about it
because we're going to use

00:06:18.013 --> 00:06:21.112
this idea to prove the chain rule

00:06:21.112 --> 00:06:23.027
in the next video.
