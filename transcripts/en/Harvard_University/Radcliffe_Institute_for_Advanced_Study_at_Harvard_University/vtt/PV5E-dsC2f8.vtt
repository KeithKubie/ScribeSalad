00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:03.430
[INTRO MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:09.580
- Good afternoon, everyone,
delighted you're here.

00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:10.460
I'm Liz Cohen.

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:13.320
I'm Dean of the Radcliffe
Institute for Advanced Study.

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:16.260
And I want to express
a special welcome

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:20.140
to the alumnae who are here
for the first Harvard Women's

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:21.330
Weekend.

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:23.840
And thank you to the
Harvard Alumni Association

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:27.560
and other alumni organizers for
bringing everyone together here

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:30.020
today and for the
rest of the weekend.

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:33.870
It's a pleasure to welcome you
all to this panel discussion

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:37.490
on Sports Marketing,
Gender, and Society.

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:41.960
And I should say that when
we planned this event,

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:48.130
we knew that we were addressing
an important and timely topic.

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:54.190
But revelations this week
about Harvard men's soccer team

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:56.850
and the Harvard women's
soccer team response

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:59.260
that was published in
the Harvard Crimson

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:05.250
has made it very clear that
this topic was timely, indeed.

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.820
At the Radcliffe institute
for Advanced Study,

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:11.520
we convene scholars,
policymakers, scientists,

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:14.330
and artists around many topics.

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:17.400
They come from all
over Harvard University

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:21.020
and around the globe to
work across disciplines

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:23.650
and at the forefront
of their fields.

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:26.660
We are also committed
to sharing new knowledge

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:29.380
and thought provoking
conversation and discussion,

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:32.780
like the one we will have
today, with a very broad public.

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:36.410
And we retain breadth
of colleges' commitment

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:39.640
to the study of women and
gender through one of our core

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:41.770
programs, the
Schlesinger Library

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:43.750
on the History of
American Women,

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:46.480
and through much of
our other programming.

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:49.780
For example, every year
we hold a conference

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:54.180
that examines a pressing issue
through the lens of gender.

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:57.850
Last year's conference was
entitled Ways With Words,

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:00.160
Exploring Language and Gender.

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:04.190
And the year before that it was
called Confronting Violence.

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:06.600
I hope that many
of you will return

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.570
for this year's
conference, which

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:13.180
is entitled Game Changers,
Sports, Gender, and Society.

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:16.530
It will begin on the evening
of Thursday, April 6th

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:19.460
and then continue all
through the next day, Friday,

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:20.290
April 7th.

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:24.590
And you could say that today's
event panel is in many ways

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:29.270
a preface to that larger
conference in April.

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:32.620
The entire April conference,
like many of our programs,

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:35.450
will be live streamed
and available afterwards

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:36.550
on our website.

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:38.340
So if you can't get
back to Cambridge,

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:40.950
you can still enjoy it.

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:43.560
Today we are delighted
to host this panel

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:47.660
in the Knafel Center, a place
with a distinctly athletic

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:48.850
history.

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:53.360
Until 1977, this
building was a gymnasium

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:55.880
for the women of
Radcliffe College.

00:02:55.880 --> 00:03:00.020
Students ran laps around the
track that's above our heads.

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:02.610
They climbed ropes,
and you can see

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:06.620
some of the scars of much
of the gym equipment.

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:09.010
And they formed their
own basketball team

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:12.230
starting in 1895,
long before they

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:14.990
had access to the
leagues, the uniforms,

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:19.360
and the other resources that
Harvard men took for granted.

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:22.200
Certainly, much has changed.

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:25.410
But damaging social
attitudes persist,

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:28.820
and not just among the members
of the Harvard men's soccer

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:29.700
team.

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:34.250
Female competitors continue to
exercise their athletic talents

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:37.980
to less acclaim and for
smaller financial rewards

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:40.760
than their male counterparts do.

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:44.090
Advertising provides
a revealing window

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:46.740
into these stubborn prejudices.

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:50.580
Take for instance, one of
the most enduring and iconic

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:53.730
examples of sports marketing.

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:58.400
Wheaties has been featuring
athletes on their cereal boxes

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:01.120
since 1934.

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:06.040
In the very first year of this
now classic marketing strategy,

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:08.660
a woman did appear on the box.

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:13.210
She was Eleanor Smith, a pilot,
who remains the only person

00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:17.450
to have flown a plane under all
four bridges of New York's East

00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:19.190
River.

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:23.260
Unfortunately, Smith
turned out to be an outlier

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:25.420
in more ways than one.

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:28.540
It would be 50 years
before Wheaties

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:30.560
featured another woman.

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:33.780
In 1984, and many of
you will remember this,

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:36.080
when Olympic gymnast,
Mary Lou Retton,

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:39.170
appeared on the
familiar orange box,

00:04:39.170 --> 00:04:42.090
children could finally
see a celebration

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:46.790
of female athleticism as they
ate their breakfast cereal.

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:49.960
Three decades later, I'm
glad to say that women

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:52.790
do appear on Wheaties boxes.

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:57.390
And two women have even made
it onto Forbes magazine's list

00:04:57.390 --> 00:04:59.870
of the highest paid athletes.

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:04.010
But female athletes
continue to face disparities

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:08.690
in pay, in endorsement
deals, and in media coverage.

00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:14.140
In 2014, only 2% of
Sports Center air time

00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:16.380
covered women's sports.

00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:20.030
And a recent lawsuit by
the US women's soccer team

00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:22.320
revealed that some
professional male soccer

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:27.970
players are paid four times more
than their female counterparts.

00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:31.300
The multi-faceted issue
of women in sports

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:34.230
is best addressed from
multiple perspectives, which

00:05:34.230 --> 00:05:36.600
is why we have brought
together this very

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:39.070
fine group of panelists today.

00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:40.660
Their discussion
will be moderated

00:05:40.660 --> 00:05:42.640
by Janet Ridge Edwards.

00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:46.430
Janet is the faculty director of
Radcliffe's Biological Science

00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:50.940
programming, and one of the two
organizers of the Game Changers

00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:53.690
conference about gender
and sports that I mentioned

00:05:53.690 --> 00:05:55.580
will be coming up in April.

00:05:55.580 --> 00:05:59.150
Janet is a Radcliffe alum
and an epidemiologist

00:05:59.150 --> 00:06:02.230
with dual appointments at
the Harvard Medical School

00:06:02.230 --> 00:06:05.740
and the Harvard T.H. Chan
School of Public Health.

00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:10.310
She currently serves as Director
of Developmental Epidemiology

00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:12.850
at the Connor's Center for
Women's Health and Gender

00:06:12.850 --> 00:06:16.420
Biology at Brigham
and Women's Hospital.

00:06:16.420 --> 00:06:19.220
So please join me now
in welcoming Janet.

00:06:19.220 --> 00:06:22.713
[APPLAUSE]

00:06:26.210 --> 00:06:28.000
Thank you, Liz, and
welcome everybody.

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:29.690
This is a great turnout.

00:06:29.690 --> 00:06:31.890
I want to just start by
putting a little bit more

00:06:31.890 --> 00:06:33.560
of a plug for that
April conference.

00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:36.060
Because we hope to
lure you all back here.

00:06:36.060 --> 00:06:38.480
We're going to
have three panels.

00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:40.600
The first one on
who gets to play.

00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:45.186
Talking about issues of
gender, race, class, ability,

00:06:45.186 --> 00:06:46.060
and who gets to play.

00:06:46.060 --> 00:06:48.800
We're going to have Donna
Lopiano come, the former CEO

00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:50.720
of the Women's
Sports Foundation,

00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:54.020
as well as past President of the
Association for Intercollegiate

00:06:54.020 --> 00:06:55.390
Athletics for Women.

00:06:55.390 --> 00:06:57.900
And we're going to have
Stephanie Wheeler, who

00:06:57.900 --> 00:07:00.220
won gold in the women's
wheelchair basketball

00:07:00.220 --> 00:07:02.950
in both Athens and Beijing,
and is now the head

00:07:02.950 --> 00:07:05.690
coach for the women's team.

00:07:05.690 --> 00:07:08.850
We will also have a panel
on gender sports, health,

00:07:08.850 --> 00:07:10.020
and wellness.

00:07:10.020 --> 00:07:13.520
And that will feature,
among others, Travis Tygart,

00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:16.710
who's CEO of the US
Anti-doping Agency, which

00:07:16.710 --> 00:07:18.770
should prove interesting.

00:07:18.770 --> 00:07:21.700
And then we'll have a
panel on gender, media,

00:07:21.700 --> 00:07:23.050
and popular culture.

00:07:23.050 --> 00:07:25.512
We'll have speakers on
masculinity in sports.

00:07:25.512 --> 00:07:26.970
We'll have some
sports journalists,

00:07:26.970 --> 00:07:29.180
and we'll talk about
transnational issues.

00:07:29.180 --> 00:07:30.690
And for our keynote
address, we're

00:07:30.690 --> 00:07:33.770
going to have Laila Ali
come talk, both about

00:07:33.770 --> 00:07:36.910
her experience as an athlete,
but also how that translates.

00:07:36.910 --> 00:07:40.480
Issues of femininity, what
you're allowed to say.

00:07:40.480 --> 00:07:43.790
And I think it'll be a really
stimulating discussion on that.

00:07:46.440 --> 00:07:49.610
I want to take a second to talk
about the elephant in the room

00:07:49.610 --> 00:07:51.930
on this campus this week.

00:07:51.930 --> 00:07:58.310
I imagine most of you have
heard about the-- I don't even

00:07:58.310 --> 00:08:00.130
know what to call it.

00:08:00.130 --> 00:08:03.360
Well, first of all the
general counsel's review

00:08:03.360 --> 00:08:08.360
of the sexually explicit
and vulgar scouting report

00:08:08.360 --> 00:08:12.425
put together by the
2012 men's soccer team

00:08:12.425 --> 00:08:16.327
and I gather from the press
coverage that has continued.

00:08:19.130 --> 00:08:24.240
The women who were
targeted in this report

00:08:24.240 --> 00:08:29.390
have written a brilliant and
powerful op-ed in response

00:08:29.390 --> 00:08:31.502
to this scouting report.

00:08:31.502 --> 00:08:33.460
And if you haven't read
it, I encourage you to.

00:08:33.460 --> 00:08:34.626
It's really quite inspiring.

00:08:34.626 --> 00:08:38.039
And if you just Google
women's soccer Harvard op-ed,

00:08:38.039 --> 00:08:41.280
you'll find it.

00:08:41.280 --> 00:08:44.790
This morning, I think it was,
Bill Littlefield commented

00:08:44.790 --> 00:08:47.740
on their powerful
letter in response

00:08:47.740 --> 00:08:53.920
to the witless cruelty of
the original attack on them.

00:08:53.920 --> 00:08:56.510
I want to quote a little
bit from this op-ed

00:08:56.510 --> 00:08:59.570
because I really
found it impressive.

00:08:59.570 --> 00:09:02.280
The women say, and this is the
six women writing together,

00:09:02.280 --> 00:09:05.560
"This document attempts to
pit us against one another,

00:09:05.560 --> 00:09:08.680
as if the judgment of a few
men is sufficient to determine

00:09:08.680 --> 00:09:09.660
our worth.

00:09:09.660 --> 00:09:12.380
But men, we know
better than that.

00:09:12.380 --> 00:09:15.150
18 years of soccer
taught us that.

00:09:15.150 --> 00:09:19.420
18 years as successful,
powerful, and undeniably

00:09:19.420 --> 00:09:23.400
brilliant female
athletes taught us that."

00:09:23.400 --> 00:09:26.740
And they go on to say, "We're
hopeful that the release

00:09:26.740 --> 00:09:30.130
of this report will lead
to productive conversation

00:09:30.130 --> 00:09:33.500
and action on Harvard's campus
within collegiate athletic

00:09:33.500 --> 00:09:36.780
teams across the country,
and into the locker room that

00:09:36.780 --> 00:09:38.330
is our world."

00:09:38.330 --> 00:09:41.940
And I'm pleased to say that's
what we're here to do today.

00:09:41.940 --> 00:09:45.250
Let me introduce to you
our three panelists.

00:09:45.250 --> 00:09:47.260
First, we have
Jessica Gellman, who

00:09:47.260 --> 00:09:50.990
is the CEO-- yeah, come on up,
thank you-- Of Kraft Analytics

00:09:50.990 --> 00:09:54.410
Group, which is
focused on the data

00:09:54.410 --> 00:09:57.270
management, advanced analytics,
and strategic marketing

00:09:57.270 --> 00:09:58.810
for the Kraft family business.

00:09:58.810 --> 00:10:00.330
She's been there 15 years.

00:10:00.330 --> 00:10:02.150
The Krafts, of
course, as the owners

00:10:02.150 --> 00:10:05.030
of the New England Patriots,
Gillette Stadium, and the New

00:10:05.030 --> 00:10:06.770
England Revolution.

00:10:06.770 --> 00:10:10.240
Her responsibilities there
include business operations,

00:10:10.240 --> 00:10:12.970
customer marketing,
and strategy.

00:10:12.970 --> 00:10:19.250
So look at her to talk about
the gendered aspects of that.

00:10:19.250 --> 00:10:22.570
She, I'm also pleased to say,
was Harvard Female Athlete

00:10:22.570 --> 00:10:24.820
of the Year after leading
Harvard's women's basketball

00:10:24.820 --> 00:10:28.230
teams two consecutive Ivy
League and NCAA tournament

00:10:28.230 --> 00:10:29.260
appearances.

00:10:29.260 --> 00:10:32.160
And has been cited by both
the Sports Business Journal

00:10:32.160 --> 00:10:37.800
and Sports Business
Journal-- So it was twice

00:10:37.800 --> 00:10:41.240
by the Sport's Business
Journal as a game changer.

00:10:41.240 --> 00:10:43.170
Then we'll have Dan
Peterson-- come on up,

00:10:43.170 --> 00:10:48.290
Dan-- who is currently
the Director of Content

00:10:48.290 --> 00:10:50.650
at AdmitHub, an ed tech startup.

00:10:50.650 --> 00:10:54.690
He's also written and edited
for ESPN Boston for eight years,

00:10:54.690 --> 00:10:58.230
covered World Cup, and
managed sports news coverage

00:10:58.230 --> 00:11:01.730
for the local ESPN sites
in Boston, Chicago, Dallas,

00:11:01.730 --> 00:11:02.967
LA, and New York.

00:11:02.967 --> 00:11:04.800
And he's very interested
in changing the way

00:11:04.800 --> 00:11:06.729
we talk about women's sports.

00:11:06.729 --> 00:11:08.270
The amount of coverage
and what we do

00:11:08.270 --> 00:11:11.560
cover when we cover
female athletes.

00:11:11.560 --> 00:11:14.870
And then finally,
Shira Springer,

00:11:14.870 --> 00:11:17.290
who writes a column on women's
sports for the Boston Globe

00:11:17.290 --> 00:11:21.120
and covers sports and society
for both NPR and WBUR.

00:11:21.120 --> 00:11:23.950
Her coverage of the
Celtics, the NBA,

00:11:23.950 --> 00:11:26.640
has earned her awards from the
Associated Press Sports Editors

00:11:26.640 --> 00:11:31.230
for Investigative and
Explanatory Journalism.

00:11:31.230 --> 00:11:34.100
And also from the
Women's Sports Foundation

00:11:34.100 --> 00:11:35.360
for her future writing.

00:11:35.360 --> 00:11:37.760
She's covered all of Boston's
major professional sports

00:11:37.760 --> 00:11:41.070
teams, as well as the Boston
Marathon, Olympics, local

00:11:41.070 --> 00:11:43.260
and national college athletics.

00:11:43.260 --> 00:11:48.170
She's appeared on numerous ESPN
programs, MSNBC, CNN, and NPR.

00:11:48.170 --> 00:11:51.760
And I can say she is about
to run the New York marathon,

00:11:51.760 --> 00:11:54.130
I think, not for the
first time, this Sunday.

00:11:54.130 --> 00:11:56.036
So please welcome our panelists.

00:11:56.036 --> 00:11:58.152
[APPLAUSE]

00:12:01.900 --> 00:12:04.480
What we'll do is we'll give
everybody about ten minutes

00:12:04.480 --> 00:12:05.935
to give their perspective.

00:12:05.935 --> 00:12:08.060
We'll have a little bit of
a discussion between us.

00:12:08.060 --> 00:12:10.530
And then we'll open up the
floor for your comments

00:12:10.530 --> 00:12:11.720
and questions.

00:12:11.720 --> 00:12:13.410
Will we have a mic?

00:12:13.410 --> 00:12:14.040
At that point.

00:12:14.040 --> 00:12:14.773
OK, great.

00:12:18.030 --> 00:12:18.530
- Hi.

00:12:18.530 --> 00:12:20.190
Good afternoon, everyone.

00:12:20.190 --> 00:12:21.770
So this is great.

00:12:21.770 --> 00:12:23.230
This is really fun to be here.

00:12:23.230 --> 00:12:25.006
Do we have any
Patriots fans here?

00:12:25.006 --> 00:12:25.820
[CHEERING]

00:12:25.820 --> 00:12:26.550
OK, good.

00:12:26.550 --> 00:12:27.420
I like to see that.

00:12:27.420 --> 00:12:30.710
So I'm going to provide a
little perspective about how

00:12:30.710 --> 00:12:34.100
we think about marketing
and specifically, the steps

00:12:34.100 --> 00:12:37.160
that we have taken, I guess
over the last ten years,

00:12:37.160 --> 00:12:41.270
to market to women and start
to reach that fan base.

00:12:41.270 --> 00:12:44.080
The Krafts have always
been incredibly forward

00:12:44.080 --> 00:12:46.385
thinking about
understanding our customers

00:12:46.385 --> 00:12:47.760
and thinking about
our customers.

00:12:47.760 --> 00:12:51.870
And so we started to make
very significant investments

00:12:51.870 --> 00:12:56.580
in the early 2000s when we were
really winning our first Super

00:12:56.580 --> 00:12:57.390
Bowls.

00:12:57.390 --> 00:13:01.460
And I think just to try
and get that single view

00:13:01.460 --> 00:13:04.260
of our customer across
our organization,

00:13:04.260 --> 00:13:06.649
I think those investments
that we were making then

00:13:06.649 --> 00:13:08.440
we weren't really
necessarily thinking, how

00:13:08.440 --> 00:13:10.590
is this going to
impact women and how we

00:13:10.590 --> 00:13:12.250
think about marketing to women?

00:13:12.250 --> 00:13:15.690
But as we started getting all of
this data about our customers,

00:13:15.690 --> 00:13:18.480
their opens, their
clicks in emails,

00:13:18.480 --> 00:13:21.870
where they're purchasing, what
they were purchasing, tickets,

00:13:21.870 --> 00:13:25.710
concerts, what products they
were purchasing at the Patriots

00:13:25.710 --> 00:13:28.740
Pro Shops or online, or whatever
the different things and how

00:13:28.740 --> 00:13:30.884
fans were engaging with us.

00:13:30.884 --> 00:13:32.550
We started to get a
better understanding

00:13:32.550 --> 00:13:35.390
of who we were serving and
who we weren't serving.

00:13:35.390 --> 00:13:38.200
So our approach, I'll give
you just a quick overview

00:13:38.200 --> 00:13:41.860
of how we think about
marketing during my time

00:13:41.860 --> 00:13:43.630
with specifically
the sports group.

00:13:43.630 --> 00:13:45.180
And then the
efforts that we have

00:13:45.180 --> 00:13:47.990
done it's impacted
us very positively,

00:13:47.990 --> 00:13:51.390
ultimately, such that we spun
out the Kraft Analytics Group.

00:13:51.390 --> 00:13:54.831
The Kraft Sports Group is still
an area that we, as a client,

00:13:54.831 --> 00:13:55.830
I guess I would call it.

00:13:55.830 --> 00:13:58.660
But we sit down in the stadium
and I do have a Super Bowl ring

00:13:58.660 --> 00:14:00.230
here from a couple years ago.

00:14:00.230 --> 00:14:05.340
So you guys can come get
pictures after if you'd like.

00:14:05.340 --> 00:14:07.830
But our approach to marketing
is something called behavior

00:14:07.830 --> 00:14:11.820
based marketing, which we have
been doing for seven years.

00:14:11.820 --> 00:14:15.050
But it's very common now,
it wasn't seven years ago.

00:14:15.050 --> 00:14:16.580
But it's all the
stuff that you hear

00:14:16.580 --> 00:14:18.980
about on Facebook
and Google, which

00:14:18.980 --> 00:14:21.230
is we're looking at
the actual behaviors

00:14:21.230 --> 00:14:25.160
that our customers take and
altering our communication

00:14:25.160 --> 00:14:26.260
and messaging.

00:14:26.260 --> 00:14:30.270
And/or we're trying to predict
what actions they might take

00:14:30.270 --> 00:14:32.670
or that might be negative
to us and that we

00:14:32.670 --> 00:14:34.860
might want to change
through our messaging.

00:14:34.860 --> 00:14:36.670
So we're trying to
make them, obviously,

00:14:36.670 --> 00:14:38.630
more loyal, more engaged.

00:14:38.630 --> 00:14:40.910
Or, if they're new
to our organization,

00:14:40.910 --> 00:14:43.710
how do we define
that they're going

00:14:43.710 --> 00:14:46.460
to be a great customer or
someone who might quickly

00:14:46.460 --> 00:14:48.120
fall out as a customer.

00:14:48.120 --> 00:14:50.540
So we think about
this through what

00:14:50.540 --> 00:14:54.980
we call the three Cs, which
is channel, consumption,

00:14:54.980 --> 00:14:56.160
and content.

00:14:56.160 --> 00:15:01.120
So the channel is direct
mail, email, phone,

00:15:01.120 --> 00:15:05.576
and how can we leverage
the different mechanisms

00:15:05.576 --> 00:15:07.200
and technology that
are out there today

00:15:07.200 --> 00:15:09.470
to better communicate.

00:15:09.470 --> 00:15:11.920
What has happened really
specifically for us

00:15:11.920 --> 00:15:13.410
in the past seven
or eight years,

00:15:13.410 --> 00:15:16.080
but then more at a micro
level in the past three

00:15:16.080 --> 00:15:18.520
to four years, is that
one to one marketing.

00:15:18.520 --> 00:15:21.410
So everyone kind of
understands channel.

00:15:21.410 --> 00:15:25.090
Consumption is the way
that you're actually

00:15:25.090 --> 00:15:26.430
getting the content.

00:15:26.430 --> 00:15:29.250
So obviously, there
was a big shift.

00:15:29.250 --> 00:15:33.510
Many of you guys will read
emails on your phone today.

00:15:33.510 --> 00:15:35.110
Three or four years
ago we were just

00:15:35.110 --> 00:15:37.440
starting to see that
shift from people reading

00:15:37.440 --> 00:15:39.980
on their computers to
reading on their phones

00:15:39.980 --> 00:15:43.600
or on apps or on social media.

00:15:43.600 --> 00:15:45.750
And I think for
all of you to think

00:15:45.750 --> 00:15:50.510
about how we have altered the
design of our communications

00:15:50.510 --> 00:15:53.320
for people to be able to
more easily read emails

00:15:53.320 --> 00:15:56.240
if it's on their phone
versus at their desk.

00:15:56.240 --> 00:15:59.920
And then the last component is
the actual content or product.

00:15:59.920 --> 00:16:03.990
So the content in
our case is it could

00:16:03.990 --> 00:16:07.440
be about the Patriots
team specifically, the X's

00:16:07.440 --> 00:16:09.280
and O's of what's
happening on the field.

00:16:09.280 --> 00:16:11.790
Which I would say was
a huge focus for us

00:16:11.790 --> 00:16:16.600
for a very long time
in investing in people.

00:16:16.600 --> 00:16:19.180
Like what Shira was
doing with the Celtics

00:16:19.180 --> 00:16:22.240
many, many years
ago to understand

00:16:22.240 --> 00:16:23.350
what happened in the game.

00:16:23.350 --> 00:16:27.540
But again, it wasn't
really the softer side.

00:16:27.540 --> 00:16:29.410
So as we were sending
out communications

00:16:29.410 --> 00:16:32.060
and we were getting more
details on what people

00:16:32.060 --> 00:16:33.880
were reading and
weren't reading,

00:16:33.880 --> 00:16:36.850
and who was clicking
on what, we definitely

00:16:36.850 --> 00:16:38.590
identified an
under-served market,

00:16:38.590 --> 00:16:40.580
which was obviously
women, which is what

00:16:40.580 --> 00:16:42.560
I'm going to talk about now.

00:16:42.560 --> 00:16:47.580
So we began about five
years ago a process

00:16:47.580 --> 00:16:51.070
to understand how we
could better engage women.

00:16:51.070 --> 00:16:52.940
And we did a bunch
of research, we

00:16:52.940 --> 00:16:55.890
looked at what other
organizations in sports

00:16:55.890 --> 00:16:57.170
were doing.

00:16:57.170 --> 00:17:00.510
And we saw, for
example, that the Ravens

00:17:00.510 --> 00:17:04.670
had created a specific
club that had events.

00:17:04.670 --> 00:17:06.280
We ultimately
decided that wasn't

00:17:06.280 --> 00:17:07.980
the avenue we wanted to go.

00:17:07.980 --> 00:17:12.369
And we got a bunch of people
in a room, men, women,

00:17:12.369 --> 00:17:14.240
different ages,
and we just started

00:17:14.240 --> 00:17:17.940
talking about what is
content that we don't think

00:17:17.940 --> 00:17:18.990
is out there.

00:17:18.990 --> 00:17:21.379
And ultimately, we came
up with this concept

00:17:21.379 --> 00:17:22.920
called the Patriots'
Lifestyle, which

00:17:22.920 --> 00:17:24.470
we launched three years ago.

00:17:24.470 --> 00:17:26.750
And it's on our
website and it is

00:17:26.750 --> 00:17:29.110
geared towards all of
the things that you

00:17:29.110 --> 00:17:31.100
hear people talk about
at the Olympics, which

00:17:31.100 --> 00:17:35.500
is the softer side, the
humanizing of the players.

00:17:35.500 --> 00:17:38.700
But when we go and
play, we're playing

00:17:38.700 --> 00:17:40.601
in San Francisco in
a few weeks, talking

00:17:40.601 --> 00:17:43.100
about what are the things, as
a Patriots fan, that you might

00:17:43.100 --> 00:17:45.550
want to go see there, right?

00:17:45.550 --> 00:17:50.860
Or what are the clothes
that the team is wearing,

00:17:50.860 --> 00:17:52.240
the players are wearing?

00:17:52.240 --> 00:17:54.930
I mean, we were having
some fun with what we saw

00:17:54.930 --> 00:17:56.880
in like In Touch in Us Weekly.

00:17:56.880 --> 00:18:00.800
So what was interesting there
is that originally, we thought

00:18:00.800 --> 00:18:02.630
it was geared towards women.

00:18:02.630 --> 00:18:04.900
But what we ultimately found
is that it wasn't geared

00:18:04.900 --> 00:18:09.720
towards women, it was geared
toward the general fan,

00:18:09.720 --> 00:18:13.670
the person who didn't really
care whether we were playing

00:18:13.670 --> 00:18:15.580
a nickel defense,
a zone defense,

00:18:15.580 --> 00:18:17.220
or the deep, deep stuff.

00:18:17.220 --> 00:18:20.280
But just wanted to
understand the team

00:18:20.280 --> 00:18:22.200
and the personalities behind it.

00:18:22.200 --> 00:18:24.930
So when we first launched
it, we didn't really

00:18:24.930 --> 00:18:27.930
know how Patriots
Lifestyle was going to do.

00:18:27.930 --> 00:18:31.330
And after the first year,
which was a couple years ago,

00:18:31.330 --> 00:18:37.000
five of our top ten most viewed
articles were the Lifestyle.

00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:40.790
So it was a hugely
under served content

00:18:40.790 --> 00:18:42.840
piece, originally
geared towards women,

00:18:42.840 --> 00:18:45.560
but I think the end
game is that it isn't

00:18:45.560 --> 00:18:46.870
just women that are reading it.

00:18:46.870 --> 00:18:49.850
And it's really fun content, and
we have a great time with it.

00:18:49.850 --> 00:18:52.840
So that's example number one.

00:18:52.840 --> 00:18:55.920
The second example that
I think is important

00:18:55.920 --> 00:19:03.690
is about the actual clothing
gear that we have and offer.

00:19:03.690 --> 00:19:06.230
Nike came in about
six years ago,

00:19:06.230 --> 00:19:09.540
and there's a number
of other 47 brands.

00:19:09.540 --> 00:19:12.590
In Touch, the Alyssa
Milano clothing line

00:19:12.590 --> 00:19:14.810
is very like soft.

00:19:14.810 --> 00:19:18.540
It was not Patriot
specific or team specific.

00:19:18.540 --> 00:19:22.590
And we were looking at what
was selling in our store

00:19:22.590 --> 00:19:23.950
and who was buying it.

00:19:23.950 --> 00:19:26.550
And what is interesting
as we did surveys

00:19:26.550 --> 00:19:30.450
to try and understand
what people were buying

00:19:30.450 --> 00:19:32.730
and what we needed
more of, we did notice

00:19:32.730 --> 00:19:35.460
that men only bought
for men, but women

00:19:35.460 --> 00:19:38.850
bought for women and men.

00:19:38.850 --> 00:19:41.760
But a lot of the feedback
when we were surveying

00:19:41.760 --> 00:19:45.520
to try and understand what
we could do to improve,

00:19:45.520 --> 00:19:48.809
and so there was a lot of
women that we were surveying,

00:19:48.809 --> 00:19:49.850
they were buying for men.

00:19:49.850 --> 00:19:51.860
We didn't have great
product for women.

00:19:51.860 --> 00:19:55.190
So we really focused on,
and it's a long process,

00:19:55.190 --> 00:19:59.530
it takes a year to buy the right
product and then to get it in.

00:19:59.530 --> 00:20:00.970
It's a lengthy process.

00:20:00.970 --> 00:20:03.770
So we started and
the results were

00:20:03.770 --> 00:20:05.740
very significant and
profound right away.

00:20:05.740 --> 00:20:10.430
We jumped by about 10% in
terms of the women's product

00:20:10.430 --> 00:20:11.940
that was selling.

00:20:11.940 --> 00:20:14.210
Such to the effect
that we ultimately

00:20:14.210 --> 00:20:17.500
decided to create
a women and kids

00:20:17.500 --> 00:20:19.810
focused store at
Patriot Place that's

00:20:19.810 --> 00:20:22.000
separate from the
Patriots Pro Shop.

00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:23.930
It's called the Pro
Shop Collection,

00:20:23.930 --> 00:20:28.320
and geared it more towards
what you might see at a mall

00:20:28.320 --> 00:20:30.590
or in a big shopping
area where there

00:20:30.590 --> 00:20:34.260
is a loungy component to it.

00:20:34.260 --> 00:20:39.240
There's still obviously a huge
team-based component to it.

00:20:39.240 --> 00:20:43.390
But in addition to having
images of the players within

00:20:43.390 --> 00:20:47.910
the store, there's also images
of kids wearing Patriots gear

00:20:47.910 --> 00:20:48.700
and women's.

00:20:48.700 --> 00:20:54.570
And we had another store before
we converted into this store.

00:20:54.570 --> 00:20:59.540
And this particular
Pro Shop Collection,

00:20:59.540 --> 00:21:02.910
it more than tripled what
that other store was doing.

00:21:02.910 --> 00:21:06.650
So we were looking
at information data

00:21:06.650 --> 00:21:11.390
and making business decisions
to reach a fan demographic that

00:21:11.390 --> 00:21:13.160
was obviously under served.

00:21:13.160 --> 00:21:16.340
And I think it's a
great credit to the Kraf

00:21:16.340 --> 00:21:20.240
to have the foresight
to think about data

00:21:20.240 --> 00:21:23.540
and what it might uncover,
but then actually go ahead

00:21:23.540 --> 00:21:24.660
and make that investment.

00:21:24.660 --> 00:21:28.310
And organizationally,
I think the number

00:21:28.310 --> 00:21:31.570
of women who are joining our
wait list or coming to games

00:21:31.570 --> 00:21:34.040
has also increased as we've
been making those changes.

00:21:34.040 --> 00:21:37.230
So we're being more
welcoming to our fans

00:21:37.230 --> 00:21:40.280
and it's had a very
positive effect.

00:21:40.280 --> 00:21:42.580
So I don't know if I
talked for ten minutes,

00:21:42.580 --> 00:21:44.680
but that's what you've got.

00:21:44.680 --> 00:21:46.716
- Great, thank you.

00:21:46.716 --> 00:21:48.930
Dan, go ahead.

00:21:48.930 --> 00:21:53.700
- So my story begins
about ten years ago.

00:21:53.700 --> 00:21:56.230
I was a high school
English teacher, a football

00:21:56.230 --> 00:21:58.220
and basketball coach in LA.

00:21:58.220 --> 00:22:01.460
And that summer of
2007 I quit my job,

00:22:01.460 --> 00:22:05.250
I moved back east
to New Haven to live

00:22:05.250 --> 00:22:09.190
with my, now, wife who is in
the audience with us today.

00:22:09.190 --> 00:22:12.300
She was working on her PhD in
History at Yale at the time,

00:22:12.300 --> 00:22:14.290
and now we're back
here in Cambridge.

00:22:14.290 --> 00:22:16.240
She's a resident
Dean at Lowell House.

00:22:16.240 --> 00:22:18.940
We've got strong
Lowell connections

00:22:18.940 --> 00:22:22.870
across the panel in the
room today, very proud.

00:22:22.870 --> 00:22:26.450
So anyway, six months
after I moved back,

00:22:26.450 --> 00:22:29.630
ESPN made the obvious
move to hire me

00:22:29.630 --> 00:22:34.330
in my stunning
lack of experience.

00:22:34.330 --> 00:22:37.450
Needless to say, I was
psyched to take a part time

00:22:37.450 --> 00:22:44.960
job working nights at a
fraction of my teacher's salary.

00:22:44.960 --> 00:22:47.470
But in all seriousness,
I was excited.

00:22:47.470 --> 00:22:50.800
I was excited to work
with professional writers,

00:22:50.800 --> 00:22:54.800
and editors, and producers,
passionate people, that

00:22:54.800 --> 00:22:56.740
loved what I was doing.

00:22:56.740 --> 00:22:59.290
I would be procrastinating
during the work day,

00:22:59.290 --> 00:23:00.790
looking at ESPN.com.

00:23:00.790 --> 00:23:03.130
Now it w like, great, I
get to provide that escape

00:23:03.130 --> 00:23:08.029
and that infotainment for
other workaday hacks, too.

00:23:08.029 --> 00:23:09.570
And I really loved
the idea of trying

00:23:09.570 --> 00:23:12.500
to fulfill ESPN's
mission, which I

00:23:12.500 --> 00:23:16.880
got on a little card along
with my ID that first day.

00:23:16.880 --> 00:23:21.780
The mission statement says,
"To serve sports fans wherever

00:23:21.780 --> 00:23:25.900
sports are watched, listened to,
discussed, debated, read about,

00:23:25.900 --> 00:23:27.190
or played."

00:23:27.190 --> 00:23:29.990
And over the ensuing
seven or eight years,

00:23:29.990 --> 00:23:32.810
I worked with a lot of
talented and dedicated folks

00:23:32.810 --> 00:23:37.470
who were and are trying to
fulfill that mission every day.

00:23:37.470 --> 00:23:38.830
It's an ambitious mission.

00:23:38.830 --> 00:23:41.900
It's basically, let's be
everything to everyone,

00:23:41.900 --> 00:23:45.420
with anything that
has to do with sports.

00:23:45.420 --> 00:23:46.420
Is it realistic?

00:23:46.420 --> 00:23:49.060
I don't know, but you
know I think it governed

00:23:49.060 --> 00:23:52.030
a lot of what we talked about.

00:23:52.030 --> 00:23:56.290
It's ambitious, it's
diffuse, it's overly broad.

00:23:56.290 --> 00:23:59.950
But I think it's
noble, in some sense.

00:23:59.950 --> 00:24:01.860
How well did we do
fulfilling that mission?

00:24:01.860 --> 00:24:04.780
I think really, really
well for some things.

00:24:04.780 --> 00:24:09.400
For the sports that dominate the
airwaves on ESPN, Major League

00:24:09.400 --> 00:24:14.240
Baseball, NFL, NBA, college
football, men's basketball,

00:24:14.240 --> 00:24:15.690
we do a great job.

00:24:15.690 --> 00:24:20.310
What I think we realize all
the time is that we struggle

00:24:20.310 --> 00:24:22.930
to do justice to serve
that mission for fans

00:24:22.930 --> 00:24:25.960
of other sports,
especially women's sports,

00:24:25.960 --> 00:24:29.050
especially women's team sports.

00:24:29.050 --> 00:24:32.240
And looking back at those
eight years at ESPN,

00:24:32.240 --> 00:24:34.270
there's a few things that
really just stood out

00:24:34.270 --> 00:24:37.560
to me in terms of
what media's role is

00:24:37.560 --> 00:24:40.870
in this discussion
of sports and gender.

00:24:40.870 --> 00:24:42.590
First, I kind of
alluded to, we take

00:24:42.590 --> 00:24:45.280
for granted that men's
sports and particularly

00:24:45.280 --> 00:24:48.770
the big three in the US,
football, baseball, basketball.

00:24:48.770 --> 00:24:52.420
We should parse and examine
them from every single possible

00:24:52.420 --> 00:24:54.700
angle, constantly all the time.

00:24:54.700 --> 00:24:56.430
We take that for granted.

00:24:56.430 --> 00:24:59.600
Conversely, the scope of
women's sports coverage

00:24:59.600 --> 00:25:05.960
is largely limited to
individual superstars,

00:25:05.960 --> 00:25:09.810
to exceptional feats, and
incredible performances.

00:25:09.810 --> 00:25:13.920
Top of the top that you can't
ignore from the women's sports

00:25:13.920 --> 00:25:14.740
teams.

00:25:14.740 --> 00:25:19.060
And thirdly, we get some
periodic news cycles

00:25:19.060 --> 00:25:20.810
that are predictable
and get sprinkled in.

00:25:20.810 --> 00:25:23.630
We get two weeks of the
Olympics every four years.

00:25:23.630 --> 00:25:28.740
We get championship week in the
spring for some of the quote,

00:25:28.740 --> 00:25:30.620
unquote "non-revenue"
college sports.

00:25:30.620 --> 00:25:35.590
So here and gone in
a flash of an eye.

00:25:35.590 --> 00:25:39.020
Third, most devastatingly
most noticeable,

00:25:39.020 --> 00:25:42.080
is that disparity
in the way that we

00:25:42.080 --> 00:25:46.870
look at athletes' physical
prowess and ability.

00:25:46.870 --> 00:25:52.490
Too many of us in the
media, in fans, at the bar,

00:25:52.490 --> 00:25:54.520
in the locker room,
wherever it is,

00:25:54.520 --> 00:25:56.840
we fall into this
sexist double standard

00:25:56.840 --> 00:25:59.310
that we've been talking
about for a long time

00:25:59.310 --> 00:26:02.950
but topical today
more than ever.

00:26:02.950 --> 00:26:06.930
Where we marvel and we
celebrate male athletes'

00:26:06.930 --> 00:26:11.340
bodies for their incredible
function and utility.

00:26:11.340 --> 00:26:13.370
Wow, so fast, so strong.

00:26:13.370 --> 00:26:16.150
He's so big, he's
so tall, incredible.

00:26:16.150 --> 00:26:18.190
And on the other
hand, female bodies

00:26:18.190 --> 00:26:21.740
are still primarily
judged on attractiveness,

00:26:21.740 --> 00:26:23.650
objectified by sex appeal.

00:26:23.650 --> 00:26:27.010
And women's bodies are the
same as men in terms of sports.

00:26:27.010 --> 00:26:30.120
They're built to do certain
things very, very, very well.

00:26:30.120 --> 00:26:34.020
But when that falls out
of a certain notion,

00:26:34.020 --> 00:26:37.410
the conversation turns
negative in a hurry in a way

00:26:37.410 --> 00:26:40.060
that it just doesn't for men.

00:26:40.060 --> 00:26:43.930
First things first then,
talking about exceptional women,

00:26:43.930 --> 00:26:47.530
exceptional individual women.

00:26:47.530 --> 00:26:52.030
Especially those that combine
that talent with attractiveness

00:26:52.030 --> 00:26:54.180
are the women that got
covered by and large more

00:26:54.180 --> 00:26:56.000
than anything else.

00:26:56.000 --> 00:26:58.490
If you look at the page
one headlines on any given

00:26:58.490 --> 00:27:02.710
day on ESPN, to be fair
we're covering every sport,

00:27:02.710 --> 00:27:06.080
we're doing scores, we're trying
to do everything for everyone.

00:27:06.080 --> 00:27:09.910
But that front page that you
go, to those headline news items

00:27:09.910 --> 00:27:13.950
are dominated by the successes
and the failures, the injuries,

00:27:13.950 --> 00:27:17.530
the misdeeds, the misfortunes,
legal troubles of big names

00:27:17.530 --> 00:27:18.980
and top teams.

00:27:18.980 --> 00:27:22.440
It's hard for women to
crack that threshold

00:27:22.440 --> 00:27:26.440
of what's deemed page one
worthy for the widest, broadest

00:27:26.440 --> 00:27:27.746
audience.

00:27:27.746 --> 00:27:29.120
But there are some
women that can

00:27:29.120 --> 00:27:34.020
hang with the likes of Lebron,
Tiger, Kobe, A-Rod, Peyton.

00:27:34.020 --> 00:27:37.510
Serena Williams comes to
mind as someone that has

00:27:37.510 --> 00:27:40.420
battled to get on that level.

00:27:40.420 --> 00:27:43.830
So has Maria
Sharapova has battled

00:27:43.830 --> 00:27:46.960
to get on that level, which
incidentally are the two women

00:27:46.960 --> 00:27:49.830
that are on that highest list.

00:27:49.830 --> 00:27:53.110
They're the only two women among
the 100 highest paid athletes

00:27:53.110 --> 00:27:56.410
in the world last year.

00:27:56.410 --> 00:27:59.980
But they have faced criticism
and dismissive attitudes

00:27:59.980 --> 00:28:03.220
that men in similar positions
have never had to deal with.

00:28:03.220 --> 00:28:05.630
Serena, because
of her skin color,

00:28:05.630 --> 00:28:08.880
because of her body type.

00:28:08.880 --> 00:28:14.070
Sharapova because she was
in that Anna-Kournikova mold

00:28:14.070 --> 00:28:16.580
of style, all
style, no substance.

00:28:16.580 --> 00:28:17.760
She reached number one.

00:28:17.760 --> 00:28:19.540
She's won multiple grand slams.

00:28:19.540 --> 00:28:22.950
She's forced herself to be
a part of the conversation

00:28:22.950 --> 00:28:26.310
based on her ability,
endorsements and looks and sex

00:28:26.310 --> 00:28:28.510
appeal aside.

00:28:28.510 --> 00:28:31.840
So those women have made it
and those women have made it

00:28:31.840 --> 00:28:32.880
onto that coverage.

00:28:32.880 --> 00:28:35.640
And some other women have
been able to, as well.

00:28:35.640 --> 00:28:38.640
Talking about the ten highest
paid female athletes, eight

00:28:38.640 --> 00:28:42.510
tennis players plus
Ronda Rousey, the MMA

00:28:42.510 --> 00:28:47.360
fighter, and Danica
Patrick, NASCAR driver.

00:28:47.360 --> 00:28:50.230
Obviously, again, physical
appearance, attractiveness,

00:28:50.230 --> 00:28:52.680
is playing a role in most
of those women's ability

00:28:52.680 --> 00:28:55.470
to get endorsement contracts.

00:28:55.470 --> 00:28:59.050
And some other women do make
it onto that national stage.

00:28:59.050 --> 00:29:01.890
But again, it's
periodic, cyclical.

00:29:01.890 --> 00:29:05.230
Ronda Rousey, when
she's promoting a fight.

00:29:05.230 --> 00:29:09.020
Simone Biles and Ali Raisman
here during the Olympics.

00:29:09.020 --> 00:29:10.720
Lindsey Vonn during
the Olympics,

00:29:10.720 --> 00:29:14.540
maybe during the World
Cup winter season.

00:29:14.540 --> 00:29:18.780
But again, those are kind of
predictable and they fade.

00:29:18.780 --> 00:29:21.000
Are we going to be talking
about Simone next year?

00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:23.150
I don't know.

00:29:23.150 --> 00:29:26.050
Shira knows the answer.

00:29:26.050 --> 00:29:29.420
So the second aspect, though,
in terms of winning coverage

00:29:29.420 --> 00:29:32.440
at ESPN and on a
national level is

00:29:32.440 --> 00:29:35.360
that some teams are
too good to be ignored,

00:29:35.360 --> 00:29:38.970
regardless of what any public
attitude or what people

00:29:38.970 --> 00:29:41.320
deem as fans are interested in.

00:29:41.320 --> 00:29:46.610
And I think my very first
weeks at ESPN I saw this.

00:29:46.610 --> 00:29:49.220
I started in March of 2008.

00:29:49.220 --> 00:29:51.620
So it's Spring
Training, March Madness

00:29:51.620 --> 00:29:54.570
is the big topic for
those weeks, right?

00:29:54.570 --> 00:29:59.610
Anybody remember who was the
men's NCAA champion in 2008?

00:29:59.610 --> 00:30:01.660
Pop quiz.

00:30:01.660 --> 00:30:02.480
Kansas.

00:30:02.480 --> 00:30:05.550
Kansas beat Memphis overtime
game, pretty good game.

00:30:05.550 --> 00:30:09.090
Bill Self's first
national title at Kansas.

00:30:09.090 --> 00:30:13.100
Great coverage, tons of
stories about all the top 25

00:30:13.100 --> 00:30:15.500
teams that whole season.

00:30:15.500 --> 00:30:20.670
Anybody remember who was the
women's champion in 2008?

00:30:20.670 --> 00:30:21.940
Good guess.

00:30:21.940 --> 00:30:23.030
Good guess.

00:30:23.030 --> 00:30:24.430
Always a good guess, but no.

00:30:24.430 --> 00:30:26.472
It was not UCONN.

00:30:26.472 --> 00:30:28.660
Tennessee, you got it, right?

00:30:28.660 --> 00:30:32.710
Pat Summitt, Tennessee goes
back to back those years.

00:30:32.710 --> 00:30:36.160
Pat Summitt's eighth national
title, exceptional woman,

00:30:36.160 --> 00:30:38.940
exceptional team.

00:30:38.940 --> 00:30:40.560
She's, at that
point, was already

00:30:40.560 --> 00:30:44.810
the all time winningest coach,
men's or women's basketball

00:30:44.810 --> 00:30:45.870
history.

00:30:45.870 --> 00:30:47.450
And we did some great stories.

00:30:47.450 --> 00:30:50.790
We did really good stories
about her and about that team.

00:30:50.790 --> 00:30:53.330
And to a lesser extent,
the UCONN women,

00:30:53.330 --> 00:30:55.090
the Stanford women.

00:30:55.090 --> 00:30:56.730
And then it just dropped off.

00:30:56.730 --> 00:30:59.000
And really, even
Tennessee if you

00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:02.210
compare the volume of coverage
to Kansas or any of the top 25

00:31:02.210 --> 00:31:05.850
men's teams, not close.

00:31:05.850 --> 00:31:09.180
And again, the Olympics teams
fit into that idea, as well,

00:31:09.180 --> 00:31:12.680
is that they'll crop up
when the timing is right,

00:31:12.680 --> 00:31:16.640
when it's on TV, when
advertisers are interested.

00:31:16.640 --> 00:31:20.370
The last thing that I want to
spend more time talking about

00:31:20.370 --> 00:31:22.830
is the way that
coverage of women

00:31:22.830 --> 00:31:26.956
tends to center around bodies
and their outward womenness

00:31:26.956 --> 00:31:30.040
more than anything we
talk about with men.

00:31:30.040 --> 00:31:35.640
I had an aha moment about
this, also pretty early, a year

00:31:35.640 --> 00:31:37.830
or two into my time with ESPN.

00:31:37.830 --> 00:31:41.440
Brittany Griner bursting
onto the national stage.

00:31:41.440 --> 00:31:43.050
A college basketball
player, I believe

00:31:43.050 --> 00:31:47.110
she was a freshman,
starting 2009 at Baylor.

00:31:47.110 --> 00:31:48.920
If anybody is a fan
of basketball here

00:31:48.920 --> 00:31:51.630
or has seen Brittany Griner
play, she is awesome.

00:31:51.630 --> 00:31:53.350
She's incredible.

00:31:53.350 --> 00:31:55.620
Game changing, once
in a lifetime talent.

00:31:55.620 --> 00:31:58.520
She's dunking, blocking
shots, rebounding, really

00:31:58.520 --> 00:32:00.280
a revolutionary.

00:32:00.280 --> 00:32:04.850
And she gets called a
freak, then and now.

00:32:04.850 --> 00:32:09.200
And Randy Moss in the NFL,
great, great former Patriot.

00:32:09.200 --> 00:32:11.510
His nickname was
The Freak, nothing

00:32:11.510 --> 00:32:13.390
but positive connotations there.

00:32:13.390 --> 00:32:15.310
He's so tall, he's so fast.

00:32:15.310 --> 00:32:17.460
He's got incredible
hands, right?

00:32:17.460 --> 00:32:20.530
Freak, beast, animal,
all these terms

00:32:20.530 --> 00:32:23.130
that we don't even think
twice about ascribing

00:32:23.130 --> 00:32:24.670
to male athletes.

00:32:24.670 --> 00:32:27.620
These terms then get used
to describe Brittany Griner

00:32:27.620 --> 00:32:30.080
and it's as negative
a connotation

00:32:30.080 --> 00:32:32.870
as you could possibly imagine.

00:32:32.870 --> 00:32:37.640
And that really was a
wake up moment for me

00:32:37.640 --> 00:32:40.650
that we have got to
change this conversation.

00:32:40.650 --> 00:32:44.260
How can we celebrate all kinds
of different body types for men

00:32:44.260 --> 00:32:46.290
and not do the same for
women when they're all

00:32:46.290 --> 00:32:47.790
designed to do the
same thing, which

00:32:47.790 --> 00:32:52.220
is excel in the most competitive
landscape that there is?

00:32:52.220 --> 00:32:54.920
So anyway, I had a
great opportunity

00:32:54.920 --> 00:32:56.610
working on the copy
desk, the news desk,

00:32:56.610 --> 00:33:01.010
to see how this whole apparatus
fit together, to be everything

00:33:01.010 --> 00:33:02.980
to all sports fans everywhere.

00:33:02.980 --> 00:33:05.510
We worked with writers across
all the beats, the big three

00:33:05.510 --> 00:33:09.010
for men, all the college
sports, tennis, golf, boxing,

00:33:09.010 --> 00:33:10.940
motor sports, all of that.

00:33:10.940 --> 00:33:12.830
So on that surface,
it seemed like we're

00:33:12.830 --> 00:33:14.570
well equipped to do a good job.

00:33:14.570 --> 00:33:18.730
We have an editorial beat, we
have coverage theoretically

00:33:18.730 --> 00:33:23.260
for every segment, every
team, every athlete.

00:33:23.260 --> 00:33:27.930
The reality, of course, is that
the resources that are devoted

00:33:27.930 --> 00:33:31.270
to that coverage are not equal.

00:33:31.270 --> 00:33:33.247
Surprise.

00:33:33.247 --> 00:33:34.330
There's no newsflash here.

00:33:34.330 --> 00:33:37.750
You all are aware of that.

00:33:37.750 --> 00:33:39.160
A lot of times,
we're scrambling,

00:33:39.160 --> 00:33:41.180
how can we get good
stories about women?

00:33:41.180 --> 00:33:43.130
We don't have writers
devoted to that.

00:33:43.130 --> 00:33:47.210
We have 32 writers covering
the NFL, 32 plus, more than one

00:33:47.210 --> 00:33:48.130
per team.

00:33:48.130 --> 00:33:50.640
When I first started at
ESPN, it's better now,

00:33:50.640 --> 00:33:54.120
but when I first started,
we had one writer devoted

00:33:54.120 --> 00:33:57.360
to women's sports other than
women's basketball, covering

00:33:57.360 --> 00:34:00.900
lacrosse, soccer, hockey.

00:34:00.900 --> 00:34:04.050
And he was also a member
of the college editorial

00:34:04.050 --> 00:34:06.970
team doing football and
basketball during the season.

00:34:06.970 --> 00:34:11.440
So you can see we had struggles.

00:34:11.440 --> 00:34:14.980
And I was not alone in the
newsroom feeling this disparity

00:34:14.980 --> 00:34:19.190
that we're leaving a
segment really underserved.

00:34:19.190 --> 00:34:26.340
And so I think that environment
fostered ESPNW, which

00:34:26.340 --> 00:34:29.239
is a site dedicated to women.

00:34:29.239 --> 00:34:32.370
So that started in 2009,
got going a little bit more

00:34:32.370 --> 00:34:33.770
in 2010.

00:34:33.770 --> 00:34:36.860
It's been plagued by controversy
and criticism, debate

00:34:36.860 --> 00:34:38.929
since those early days.

00:34:38.929 --> 00:34:43.710
To understand the climate,
25% of ESPN viewers are women.

00:34:43.710 --> 00:34:47.420
Also alluded to, about
8% of programming

00:34:47.420 --> 00:34:49.150
is dedicated to women's sports.

00:34:49.150 --> 00:34:51.310
But when you're talking
about Sports Center,

00:34:51.310 --> 00:34:54.659
the flagship show,
it's 1.8%, 2.2%.

00:34:54.659 --> 00:34:57.070
It's never been
more than 2% or 3%

00:34:57.070 --> 00:34:59.690
at most in the last 20 years.

00:34:59.690 --> 00:35:03.280
that gets devoted to women's
sports from a study at USC.

00:35:03.280 --> 00:35:06.030
It's actually decreased
over the last ten years,

00:35:06.030 --> 00:35:07.890
believe it or not.

00:35:07.890 --> 00:35:11.990
And into that void comes ESPNW.

00:35:11.990 --> 00:35:14.260
One of the authors
of that report at USC

00:35:14.260 --> 00:35:18.480
said he had mixed feelings about
it, quoting Michael Messner,

00:35:18.480 --> 00:35:21.310
quote "It's going to give
women's sports' fans a place

00:35:21.310 --> 00:35:24.720
to go, but it might ultimately
ghettoize women's sports

00:35:24.720 --> 00:35:27.770
and kind of take ESPN
off the hook in terms

00:35:27.770 --> 00:35:31.240
of actually covering them
on its main broadcast."

00:35:31.240 --> 00:35:33.290
A fair criticism to be sure.

00:35:33.290 --> 00:35:35.990
I think on the flip side
there's a lot of people,

00:35:35.990 --> 00:35:39.620
I would put myself in that
camp, that hope and still

00:35:39.620 --> 00:35:42.190
hope that ESPNW is
more than a defense

00:35:42.190 --> 00:35:45.990
against these allegations of
sexism and lack of programming.

00:35:45.990 --> 00:35:48.730
I think that there is a
two-fold approach in place

00:35:48.730 --> 00:35:51.780
to devote more time and
resources to covering

00:35:51.780 --> 00:35:54.510
women's sports, and especially
women's team sports.

00:35:54.510 --> 00:35:57.590
And also to give
voice to more women

00:35:57.590 --> 00:36:01.000
perspectives, not
just writers, but also

00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:05.460
to give a forum to pro athletes,
to fans, recreational athletes.

00:36:05.460 --> 00:36:08.090
And I think it was a chance to
try and find the great stories

00:36:08.090 --> 00:36:10.770
that we know are going to
resonate with an audience, kind

00:36:10.770 --> 00:36:12.940
of the similar, great
stories resonate

00:36:12.940 --> 00:36:16.490
with men and with women,
regardless of or about

00:36:16.490 --> 00:36:17.390
men or women.

00:36:17.390 --> 00:36:20.310
So I'm proud that there is at
least an attempt to do that.

00:36:20.310 --> 00:36:21.590
How is it working out?

00:36:21.590 --> 00:36:23.900
The debate continues,
we can talk about that.

00:36:23.900 --> 00:36:26.620
I know there's a lot of talented
writers there today that

00:36:26.620 --> 00:36:29.650
are reporting and
doing great stories.

00:36:29.650 --> 00:36:32.840
A lot of the criticism
to me about ESPNW

00:36:32.840 --> 00:36:34.899
mirrors the criticism
of women's sports.

00:36:34.899 --> 00:36:36.940
Shira has made this point
much better than I ever

00:36:36.940 --> 00:36:40.520
could, that women's sports
are really defined often,

00:36:40.520 --> 00:36:42.290
all too often, about
what they're not

00:36:42.290 --> 00:36:43.880
rather than what they are.

00:36:43.880 --> 00:36:46.320
They're not as good as men,
it's not as competitive,

00:36:46.320 --> 00:36:48.930
the fans are as passionate,
on and on and on.

00:36:48.930 --> 00:36:52.090
All of this throwaway
dismissive criticism.

00:36:52.090 --> 00:36:55.090
And here we are today.

00:36:55.090 --> 00:36:57.860
And what more stark
reminder do we

00:36:57.860 --> 00:37:00.130
have than what's
happened on this campus

00:37:00.130 --> 00:37:02.190
in the last few weeks?

00:37:02.190 --> 00:37:04.350
But really, at least
in the last five years?

00:37:04.350 --> 00:37:07.267
And we know that it's been
perpetuating longer than that.

00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:14.520
How sad is it that the press
coverage that the women's

00:37:14.520 --> 00:37:17.000
Harvard soccer team is
getting in The New York Times

00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:18.570
is them having to
defend themselves

00:37:18.570 --> 00:37:25.510
against yet another juvenile,
sexist, chauvinistic attack?

00:37:25.510 --> 00:37:28.570
We owe these women more
than that, both in the media

00:37:28.570 --> 00:37:30.740
and as fans and as people.

00:37:30.740 --> 00:37:33.270
I have a
three-month-old daughter

00:37:33.270 --> 00:37:35.771
and I hope when she gets
on the internet we'll

00:37:35.771 --> 00:37:36.895
have a better conversation.

00:37:40.040 --> 00:37:42.750
- I for one want to know when
the next Harvard women's soccer

00:37:42.750 --> 00:37:46.010
game is going to
be playing at home.

00:37:46.010 --> 00:37:49.110
Tomorrow one o'clock.

00:37:49.110 --> 00:37:52.880
All right, all right, great.

00:37:52.880 --> 00:37:54.760
Mark that on your
calendars, everyone.

00:37:54.760 --> 00:37:56.690
It seems like it's
already been marked.

00:37:56.690 --> 00:38:00.840
- Thanks Jessica and Dan,
you've teed this up nicely.

00:38:00.840 --> 00:38:03.000
I'm a writer, so I
often think in terms

00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:06.930
of vignettes, scene
setters, stories

00:38:06.930 --> 00:38:10.070
that are illustrative
of the bigger picture.

00:38:10.070 --> 00:38:15.400
So I'm going to take you
all back to the fall of 2013

00:38:15.400 --> 00:38:16.900
and give you a
little idea of how

00:38:16.900 --> 00:38:19.750
it works from the inside
when you're trying

00:38:19.750 --> 00:38:23.040
to cover female athletes.

00:38:23.040 --> 00:38:25.590
So in the fall of
2013, I learned

00:38:25.590 --> 00:38:28.180
that the US Women's
National Hockey

00:38:28.180 --> 00:38:31.570
Team, which would be whittled
down to the US Women's Olympic

00:38:31.570 --> 00:38:36.990
Hockey Team was going to
put its live-in training

00:38:36.990 --> 00:38:39.620
camp in Concord, Lexington.

00:38:39.620 --> 00:38:42.520
It was going to be
based in Massachusetts.

00:38:42.520 --> 00:38:44.020
And the interesting
thing about this

00:38:44.020 --> 00:38:47.150
was that because the
female players were

00:38:47.150 --> 00:38:50.290
on such strict stipends, they
were going, most of them,

00:38:50.290 --> 00:38:52.500
I believe it was 80%
of the team members,

00:38:52.500 --> 00:38:56.970
were going to be living with
local families in Lexington,

00:38:56.970 --> 00:38:59.780
in Bedford, in Concord,
in Cambridge, wherever

00:38:59.780 --> 00:39:03.900
they could find a room
billeting with them.

00:39:03.900 --> 00:39:07.090
And I thought, gosh, that
is a really great story.

00:39:07.090 --> 00:39:11.070
Because six months from now,
the attention of the world

00:39:11.070 --> 00:39:13.010
is going to be on these women.

00:39:13.010 --> 00:39:16.880
And you knew it was going to
come down to the US and Canada

00:39:16.880 --> 00:39:20.070
for the gold medal in Sochi.

00:39:20.070 --> 00:39:22.850
And here we had, with
the Boston Globe,

00:39:22.850 --> 00:39:28.020
an opportunity to go out and
see what was developing here

00:39:28.020 --> 00:39:31.360
with the team chemistry, and
also this really unique living

00:39:31.360 --> 00:39:32.310
situation.

00:39:32.310 --> 00:39:36.370
I mean, how many of you have
Olympians living next door?

00:39:36.370 --> 00:39:37.780
Great story.

00:39:37.780 --> 00:39:38.280
Oh, you do?

00:39:38.280 --> 00:39:42.110
OK, I see a hand going up.

00:39:42.110 --> 00:39:43.310
Perfect.

00:39:43.310 --> 00:39:45.870
So you have these
Olympians living next door,

00:39:45.870 --> 00:39:47.040
it's a great story.

00:39:47.040 --> 00:39:49.260
And I go to the sports
editors and I say, hey,

00:39:49.260 --> 00:39:53.760
why don't we do a really
great feature on these women?

00:39:53.760 --> 00:39:57.610
I have permission from their
host to go into the homes

00:39:57.610 --> 00:40:02.530
and really do something very
colorful, very in-depth.

00:40:02.530 --> 00:40:06.170
And the bonus is we get
to know these women,

00:40:06.170 --> 00:40:10.210
humanize them, get close
to them, build contacts.

00:40:10.210 --> 00:40:12.590
So when they are in
that gold medal game

00:40:12.590 --> 00:40:16.440
or leading up to that gold medal
game in Sochi, I'll have an in.

00:40:16.440 --> 00:40:20.090
I'll be able to pull them
aside in the mix zone

00:40:20.090 --> 00:40:21.910
where all the
international media is,

00:40:21.910 --> 00:40:24.670
and they'll recognize me, and
it will improve our coverage

00:40:24.670 --> 00:40:26.300
down the line.

00:40:26.300 --> 00:40:31.580
And this is nothing against
my three male sports editors,

00:40:31.580 --> 00:40:34.270
but they passed on the story.

00:40:34.270 --> 00:40:38.580
And I said, well, this is a
story that has to get done.

00:40:38.580 --> 00:40:40.620
So I went to the magazine.

00:40:40.620 --> 00:40:43.990
And the reason, by the way,
that the sports editors passed

00:40:43.990 --> 00:40:46.410
was because they saw it as
more of a lifestyle story.

00:40:46.410 --> 00:40:49.550
They thought that this
was not about athletics.

00:40:49.550 --> 00:40:50.760
And I tried to make the case.

00:40:50.760 --> 00:40:53.920
I said, yes, but these are
the women who are going

00:40:53.920 --> 00:40:55.730
to contend for the gold medal.

00:40:55.730 --> 00:41:00.010
If it was a men's team and
there was an opportunity,

00:41:00.010 --> 00:41:01.790
let's say to-- and
believe me, I've

00:41:01.790 --> 00:41:03.460
done this for the
sports section.

00:41:03.460 --> 00:41:07.350
Go and visit a Bruins
player in his apartment

00:41:07.350 --> 00:41:09.885
and get a sense of
him off the ice.

00:41:09.885 --> 00:41:11.260
Would be no
question, it would be

00:41:11.260 --> 00:41:13.170
go ahead, let's
assign a photographer,

00:41:13.170 --> 00:41:14.920
let's assign a videographer.

00:41:14.920 --> 00:41:16.550
Go, go, go, go, go.

00:41:16.550 --> 00:41:18.060
But that wasn't the case.

00:41:18.060 --> 00:41:21.590
So I went to the magazine
and they loved it.

00:41:21.590 --> 00:41:24.880
And so we ended up doing
this story for the magazine.

00:41:24.880 --> 00:41:28.210
It was actually called
Olympians Next Door.

00:41:28.210 --> 00:41:30.620
And the beneficiary ended
up being The Globe's sports

00:41:30.620 --> 00:41:33.560
section, because as predicted
when I got to Sochi,

00:41:33.560 --> 00:41:37.120
these women knew who I was and
were coming to me in the mix

00:41:37.120 --> 00:41:37.620
zone.

00:41:37.620 --> 00:41:40.530
So I got great coverage
of the women's hockey team

00:41:40.530 --> 00:41:43.410
for our local audiences.

00:41:43.410 --> 00:41:48.880
So fast forward
about eight months.

00:41:48.880 --> 00:41:50.850
And the magazine
comes to me again.

00:41:50.850 --> 00:41:53.060
And they said, we got
really good feedback

00:41:53.060 --> 00:41:56.250
on that women's sports story.

00:41:56.250 --> 00:41:57.580
Do you have another idea?

00:41:57.580 --> 00:41:59.770
And the policy was
always I had to pass it

00:41:59.770 --> 00:42:01.130
through the sports editors.

00:42:01.130 --> 00:42:04.180
They had right of first refusal.

00:42:04.180 --> 00:42:06.110
I said, well, one
thing that's always

00:42:06.110 --> 00:42:08.720
been interesting
to me is, why is it

00:42:08.720 --> 00:42:12.990
that we have a lot of female
pro sports teams in Boston.

00:42:12.990 --> 00:42:16.262
We had at that time I believe
it was two women's hockey teams.

00:42:16.262 --> 00:42:17.470
There was another one coming.

00:42:17.470 --> 00:42:19.847
There was a women's hockey
team, there was a soccer team,

00:42:19.847 --> 00:42:20.930
there was a lacrosse team.

00:42:20.930 --> 00:42:23.610
We had tons and they were
getting zero attention.

00:42:23.610 --> 00:42:25.500
They were being ignored by fans.

00:42:25.500 --> 00:42:28.420
And I said, why don't
we write an article

00:42:28.420 --> 00:42:33.980
about why do sports fans
ignore women's pro sports?

00:42:33.980 --> 00:42:35.550
I thought this
was a great story.

00:42:35.550 --> 00:42:38.110
So I went to the sports
editors and I said,

00:42:38.110 --> 00:42:39.440
any interest in this?

00:42:39.440 --> 00:42:41.840
No, no, no, no, no.

00:42:41.840 --> 00:42:45.590
Magazine, of course, loved it,
turned it into a cover story.

00:42:45.590 --> 00:42:49.120
Now the interesting thing
is, and in the process

00:42:49.120 --> 00:42:51.550
of doing that story,
I got to explore

00:42:51.550 --> 00:42:55.660
a lot of the issues we're going
to be talking about today.

00:42:55.660 --> 00:42:57.140
And one of the
interesting people

00:42:57.140 --> 00:42:59.020
that I had an
opportunity to talk to

00:42:59.020 --> 00:43:02.650
was MIT Dean, David Schmittlein.

00:43:02.650 --> 00:43:04.640
He's a marketing expert.

00:43:04.640 --> 00:43:06.150
And I asked him.

00:43:06.150 --> 00:43:12.200
I said, what do women's
sports need to do?

00:43:12.200 --> 00:43:17.150
What can they do to muster more
to generate more attention?

00:43:17.150 --> 00:43:19.040
And he says, well,
I think they need

00:43:19.040 --> 00:43:22.750
to stop selling themselves
as in competition

00:43:22.750 --> 00:43:25.510
with the men's sports.

00:43:25.510 --> 00:43:28.510
You're never going
to be perceived as as

00:43:28.510 --> 00:43:30.620
good as the men's product.

00:43:30.620 --> 00:43:31.740
At least not now.

00:43:31.740 --> 00:43:34.750
So when you pit yourself
against the men's product,

00:43:34.750 --> 00:43:36.160
you're doomed to failure.

00:43:38.080 --> 00:43:41.030
He says you have to market the
women's product as something

00:43:41.030 --> 00:43:44.880
different and better
because of that difference.

00:43:44.880 --> 00:43:47.110
I said, well, are
there any products

00:43:47.110 --> 00:43:51.310
in the history of advertising
that have been successful

00:43:51.310 --> 00:43:54.450
with that model where you market
them as different and better

00:43:54.450 --> 00:43:55.410
for that difference?

00:43:55.410 --> 00:43:58.470
And he just said to me,
tastes great, less filling.

00:43:58.470 --> 00:44:04.340
So light beer, he said, should
be a model for the way women

00:44:04.340 --> 00:44:06.680
market themselves.

00:44:06.680 --> 00:44:09.660
Tastes great, less filling,
different, but better

00:44:09.660 --> 00:44:11.430
in a different way.

00:44:11.430 --> 00:44:14.490
So going back and the
article that I did

00:44:14.490 --> 00:44:16.430
was actually a real
education for me

00:44:16.430 --> 00:44:20.030
in terms of what women face when
they're trying to get coverage.

00:44:20.030 --> 00:44:21.970
How difficult it can
be, how difficult

00:44:21.970 --> 00:44:24.690
it can be to market
female athletes

00:44:24.690 --> 00:44:26.320
and the obstacles there.

00:44:26.320 --> 00:44:29.790
And I want to go back to
one of the key things,

00:44:29.790 --> 00:44:31.720
and Dan, don't take
this the wrong way,

00:44:31.720 --> 00:44:33.428
but I think one of
the interesting things

00:44:33.428 --> 00:44:35.950
about the magazine is that
there are three, or at the time

00:44:35.950 --> 00:44:38.550
there were three
female editors there.

00:44:38.550 --> 00:44:41.770
And I think that people who are
in decision making positions

00:44:41.770 --> 00:44:46.510
when it comes to content
make a huge, huge difference.

00:44:46.510 --> 00:44:49.450
Because they look at
it differently already.

00:44:49.450 --> 00:44:51.200
You don't have to
market to them that it's

00:44:51.200 --> 00:44:52.520
different, but better.

00:44:52.520 --> 00:44:57.360
They see different, but better,
and want to write about it,

00:44:57.360 --> 00:44:59.470
want to market it that way.

00:44:59.470 --> 00:45:02.240
So looking for places
where there are women

00:45:02.240 --> 00:45:05.820
in the decision making system.

00:45:05.820 --> 00:45:08.100
Jess is a good
example of that, too.

00:45:08.100 --> 00:45:11.200
I think you really can pick up
on that because you're female.

00:45:11.200 --> 00:45:14.040
You can say OK, here's
an underserved market.

00:45:14.040 --> 00:45:16.250
And not only is it an
underserved market,

00:45:16.250 --> 00:45:18.280
but this is an
underserved market

00:45:18.280 --> 00:45:21.090
where we can make a big impact.

00:45:21.090 --> 00:45:24.210
And there's value there,
there are customers there,

00:45:24.210 --> 00:45:26.730
there are readers there.

00:45:26.730 --> 00:45:29.730
And I think that sometimes
comes from a female perspective

00:45:29.730 --> 00:45:31.860
and a female perspective
not only as a writer,

00:45:31.860 --> 00:45:35.910
but a female
perspective at the top.

00:45:35.910 --> 00:45:39.120
And so from there though,
the interesting thing

00:45:39.120 --> 00:45:42.460
was as soon as this
article, this cover story,

00:45:42.460 --> 00:45:44.700
came out in the
magazine, it actually

00:45:44.700 --> 00:45:46.770
generated a heck of
a lot of comments

00:45:46.770 --> 00:45:48.650
and a heck of a lot of clicks.

00:45:48.650 --> 00:45:50.800
And the sports editors saw that.

00:45:50.800 --> 00:45:53.200
And from there, they asked me.

00:45:53.200 --> 00:45:56.630
They said, how would you feel
about writing a regular column

00:45:56.630 --> 00:45:58.740
on women's sports?

00:45:58.740 --> 00:46:00.550
And so that's what it took.

00:46:00.550 --> 00:46:06.650
You had to come around from
the outside to prove to them.

00:46:06.650 --> 00:46:08.560
I think there's that
aspect, and it's

00:46:08.560 --> 00:46:11.190
a constant when you're
dealing with women in sports

00:46:11.190 --> 00:46:13.310
and marketing and coverage.

00:46:13.310 --> 00:46:16.200
You constantly have
to prove that women

00:46:16.200 --> 00:46:19.600
are worth the coverage, that
there's an audience out there.

00:46:19.600 --> 00:46:23.370
And it's not just one time, it's
multiple times, over and over

00:46:23.370 --> 00:46:24.530
and over again.

00:46:24.530 --> 00:46:26.280
And there's a constant
education that

00:46:26.280 --> 00:46:31.380
goes on of male editors, of
male readers, of female editors,

00:46:31.380 --> 00:46:33.940
of female readers about
what's interesting,

00:46:33.940 --> 00:46:37.340
what an audience will
want, and what's out there.

00:46:37.340 --> 00:46:39.380
Because we talk
about great stories.

00:46:39.380 --> 00:46:40.880
Dan was talking
about great stories.

00:46:40.880 --> 00:46:45.330
There are phenomenal stories
out there about female athletes

00:46:45.330 --> 00:46:48.750
that don't get covered,
and it's an endless point

00:46:48.750 --> 00:46:50.252
of frustration with me.

00:46:50.252 --> 00:46:51.960
And so I think I'll
stop there, because I

00:46:51.960 --> 00:46:54.251
know we want to get onto the
panel discussion about it.

00:46:54.251 --> 00:46:56.650
But just a little
food for thought

00:46:56.650 --> 00:46:59.680
in terms of how it works
from the inside and the

00:46:59.680 --> 00:47:03.010
struggles that you
face when you're

00:47:03.010 --> 00:47:05.300
pushing to get that
coverage and get

00:47:05.300 --> 00:47:08.580
people interested in women's
sports and female athletes.

00:47:08.580 --> 00:47:10.580
- Can I just say two things.

00:47:10.580 --> 00:47:17.680
First, Dan, your point about the
resources are not equal for men

00:47:17.680 --> 00:47:20.480
and women's sports coverage
was really interesting.

00:47:20.480 --> 00:47:24.660
And I think as I described what
we were doing from a marketing

00:47:24.660 --> 00:47:27.860
perspective at the Patriots, it
wasn't all of a sudden let's go

00:47:27.860 --> 00:47:28.700
market to women.

00:47:28.700 --> 00:47:32.910
It was a very measured approach
improving value over time.

00:47:32.910 --> 00:47:38.440
And so it's a continuing
investment, even to the case

00:47:38.440 --> 00:47:40.960
that this past
year in the stadium

00:47:40.960 --> 00:47:48.390
we now offer a location
for women to breastfeed.

00:47:48.390 --> 00:47:54.980
So let's serve that and continue
to help that particular fan.

00:47:54.980 --> 00:47:56.481
And then on the
second thing, Shira,

00:47:56.481 --> 00:47:58.188
you've been involved
since the beginning.

00:47:58.188 --> 00:48:00.920
I'm also one of the co-founders
and chairs of the MIT Sloan

00:48:00.920 --> 00:48:02.570
Sports Analytics Conference.

00:48:02.570 --> 00:48:08.650
And there have been a lot of
requests from the students

00:48:08.650 --> 00:48:11.740
for there to be panels
on women's sports.

00:48:11.740 --> 00:48:12.960
- And from one moderator.

00:48:12.960 --> 00:48:15.070
- Yes, and one moderator, Shira.

00:48:15.070 --> 00:48:19.790
But the concern is
the actual attendees

00:48:19.790 --> 00:48:23.070
at the conference
tends to be very male

00:48:23.070 --> 00:48:27.090
heavy who are potentially not
interested in women's sports.

00:48:27.090 --> 00:48:29.910
And so one of the ways that
we addressed that a couple

00:48:29.910 --> 00:48:34.790
years ago is we had Sue
Bird who is probably

00:48:34.790 --> 00:48:37.350
the best point guard in
women's basketball history.

00:48:37.350 --> 00:48:39.740
We put her on the
basketball panel.

00:48:39.740 --> 00:48:42.404
And actually we had an
issue with the moderator

00:48:42.404 --> 00:48:43.570
not asking enough questions.

00:48:43.570 --> 00:48:44.940
We should have made you
the moderator, Shira.

00:48:44.940 --> 00:48:46.565
But we had the issue
with the moderator

00:48:46.565 --> 00:48:50.016
not asking her enough
direct questions.

00:48:50.016 --> 00:48:52.560
But Shane Battier was
also on the panel.

00:48:52.560 --> 00:48:55.050
He was a great
college player, played

00:48:55.050 --> 00:48:57.490
in the NBA for a very long time.

00:48:57.490 --> 00:49:01.880
And he was the one who
was basically engaging

00:49:01.880 --> 00:49:06.080
and offering assists
if you will to Sue.

00:49:06.080 --> 00:49:09.360
What was really smart is
what Sue did last year

00:49:09.360 --> 00:49:10.359
when she came back.

00:49:10.359 --> 00:49:12.650
Because I remember talking
to her on the phone the year

00:49:12.650 --> 00:49:12.960
before.

00:49:12.960 --> 00:49:14.710
She's like, what am I
going to talk about?

00:49:14.710 --> 00:49:16.810
And I said, you're an athlete.

00:49:16.810 --> 00:49:20.250
You play sports, talk
about how you use data.

00:49:20.250 --> 00:49:23.260
And she did, but I don't think
in her mind she really realized

00:49:23.260 --> 00:49:25.130
that that's what she was doing.

00:49:25.130 --> 00:49:27.180
And then last year
with the conference,

00:49:27.180 --> 00:49:28.910
she had actually
written the piece

00:49:28.910 --> 00:49:31.050
with the Players'
Tribune that was

00:49:31.050 --> 00:49:33.910
all about how women's
sports doesn't have

00:49:33.910 --> 00:49:35.630
enough analytics around it.

00:49:35.630 --> 00:49:37.750
And there's
obviously you kind of

00:49:37.750 --> 00:49:39.420
alluded to all of
the data that's

00:49:39.420 --> 00:49:43.060
out there on men's sports,
and that there just

00:49:43.060 --> 00:49:44.780
isn't that information
on women's sports.

00:49:44.780 --> 00:49:48.930
And I thought wow, what
an impact in a year

00:49:48.930 --> 00:49:51.610
basically now, Sue has
started this conversation

00:49:51.610 --> 00:49:53.090
from the perch that
she is at, it's

00:49:53.090 --> 00:49:55.010
a conversation that
had been going on.

00:49:55.010 --> 00:49:58.872
But it got a tremendous amount
of notoriety and exposure

00:49:58.872 --> 00:50:00.580
because it was the
right audience, people

00:50:00.580 --> 00:50:03.280
who are in the data and
analytics covering sports.

00:50:03.280 --> 00:50:06.990
And then you have this person
on a panel talking about it.

00:50:06.990 --> 00:50:08.804
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:50:10.390 --> 00:50:11.560
- Jess and I talk a lot.

00:50:11.560 --> 00:50:16.390
So to piggyback off of
the resources thing,

00:50:16.390 --> 00:50:20.300
I'm the only one who's
really actively writing

00:50:20.300 --> 00:50:23.180
about women's sports
issues for The Globe.

00:50:23.180 --> 00:50:26.770
And just to give you an idea of
sometimes how that works out,

00:50:26.770 --> 00:50:28.650
which is marathon coverage.

00:50:28.650 --> 00:50:33.890
And I said, we really need to
have stories about women here.

00:50:33.890 --> 00:50:38.070
And we weren't having them
in the pitch meetings.

00:50:38.070 --> 00:50:42.140
And as a result, I was
completely overloaded

00:50:42.140 --> 00:50:44.120
because I'd taken
on two stories.

00:50:44.120 --> 00:50:47.740
I had a slate of well, you need
to get these stories done X, Y,

00:50:47.740 --> 00:50:50.280
and Z. And then I
had pitched a story

00:50:50.280 --> 00:50:53.790
about a nurse who had
been tragically killed

00:50:53.790 --> 00:50:56.540
while training for
the Boston Marathon.

00:50:56.540 --> 00:51:00.150
And the breastfeeding
thing reminded me

00:51:00.150 --> 00:51:02.470
of it, pregnancy exemptions.

00:51:02.470 --> 00:51:04.550
Women don't get
pregnancy exemptions

00:51:04.550 --> 00:51:06.020
if you become pregnant.

00:51:06.020 --> 00:51:09.250
After you register for
the Boston Marathon,

00:51:09.250 --> 00:51:11.430
you lose your place
in the marathon

00:51:11.430 --> 00:51:13.866
or you can't reclaim
it if you can't

00:51:13.866 --> 00:51:15.240
run because you're
six, or seven,

00:51:15.240 --> 00:51:16.281
or eight months pregnant.

00:51:16.281 --> 00:51:19.780
But anyway, the point being
is with one person doing it,

00:51:19.780 --> 00:51:21.580
sometimes you just
can't get to it all.

00:51:21.580 --> 00:51:24.000
And you look around
and you say, I

00:51:24.000 --> 00:51:25.770
want to be writing
about this, but I

00:51:25.770 --> 00:51:28.850
have to write about the Kenyan
champion, or this champion.

00:51:28.850 --> 00:51:32.910
And it's unfortunate because
women in the business

00:51:32.910 --> 00:51:35.630
do want to write and
cover female athletes,

00:51:35.630 --> 00:51:37.960
but they don't have the time.

00:51:37.960 --> 00:51:41.130
And they're not given,
sometimes, the support

00:51:41.130 --> 00:51:42.380
from the people who are there.

00:51:42.380 --> 00:51:44.980
- I guess I would say that
you kind of alluded to,

00:51:44.980 --> 00:51:49.630
but even when I took over the
Patriots' retail business,

00:51:49.630 --> 00:51:53.760
we had ten people in the
business, there were no women.

00:51:53.760 --> 00:51:56.280
So there was no
one who even would

00:51:56.280 --> 00:51:58.655
say what is the women's product
that we should be buying.

00:51:58.655 --> 00:52:00.363
And I'm not going to
sit here and say I'm

00:52:00.363 --> 00:52:01.730
the most fashionable person.

00:52:01.730 --> 00:52:03.370
And I don't necessarily know.

00:52:03.370 --> 00:52:05.240
But the stuff that
I like might not

00:52:05.240 --> 00:52:08.650
be what-- there's many
different types of women.

00:52:08.650 --> 00:52:12.310
There's women who want to
wear big baggy stuff and then

00:52:12.310 --> 00:52:14.320
women who want to wear
more fashionable stuff.

00:52:14.320 --> 00:52:18.220
And so understanding enough
people were saying to me

00:52:18.220 --> 00:52:19.720
you need better
women stuff, I don't

00:52:19.720 --> 00:52:22.280
know if they would have
said that to the men,

00:52:22.280 --> 00:52:23.860
but they said it to me.

00:52:23.860 --> 00:52:26.460
I was in a position to
actually action off of it.

00:52:26.460 --> 00:52:29.860
And we now actually,
when a product comes in,

00:52:29.860 --> 00:52:36.142
we pull I feel like I can speak
for one set or view of what

00:52:36.142 --> 00:52:36.850
women might like.

00:52:36.850 --> 00:52:38.975
But then we have the more
fashionable women come in

00:52:38.975 --> 00:52:40.190
and say, would you wear this?

00:52:40.190 --> 00:52:40.856
Would this work?

00:52:40.856 --> 00:52:43.010
And we have them actually
go through the catalog

00:52:43.010 --> 00:52:45.180
and help us pick
out those products.

00:52:45.180 --> 00:52:46.930
- And I remember
talking, also, I actually

00:52:46.930 --> 00:52:51.210
had lunch with Sue Bird
after the conference right

00:52:51.210 --> 00:52:52.300
after she spoke.

00:52:52.300 --> 00:52:54.050
The other thing that
happens is that there

00:52:54.050 --> 00:52:57.330
are such subtle ways of
discriminating against women

00:52:57.330 --> 00:53:00.350
in sports that sometimes
you don't even recognize it

00:53:00.350 --> 00:53:02.140
until it's too late.

00:53:02.140 --> 00:53:06.690
It's just there is for lack of
a better way of describing it,

00:53:06.690 --> 00:53:09.440
it is still in many ways
a male dominated culture.

00:53:09.440 --> 00:53:17.110
And some people, some men
don't see it the same way.

00:53:17.110 --> 00:53:22.160
And it's a lot of education
and it takes time.

00:53:22.160 --> 00:53:22.680
- It does.

00:53:22.680 --> 00:53:24.200
And that extends to--

00:53:24.200 --> 00:53:24.920
- Says the man.

00:53:24.920 --> 00:53:28.440
- Well, the athletes,
it's true in sports

00:53:28.440 --> 00:53:30.730
on both sides of the camera.

00:53:30.730 --> 00:53:32.340
You know how it
is in the newsroom

00:53:32.340 --> 00:53:38.490
and trying to pitch stories to
often all-male sports editors.

00:53:38.490 --> 00:53:41.930
Made me think of something
that happened just this summer.

00:53:41.930 --> 00:53:44.350
I don't know if it was
under the radar or not,

00:53:44.350 --> 00:53:48.470
but ESPN has a sports reporters
show, which I always loved.

00:53:48.470 --> 00:53:51.510
It's the people that know
sports the best having

00:53:51.510 --> 00:53:55.680
a conversation not unlike this.

00:53:55.680 --> 00:53:59.520
The first time that all three
panelists or four panelists

00:53:59.520 --> 00:54:05.270
were women happened two
months ago in late August 2016

00:54:05.270 --> 00:54:08.250
was the first time
that it was all women.

00:54:08.250 --> 00:54:09.830
How many times was it all men?

00:54:09.830 --> 00:54:10.900
Too many to count.

00:54:10.900 --> 00:54:12.610
How many times was
Jackie Macmullan

00:54:12.610 --> 00:54:13.920
the only woman on the show?

00:54:13.920 --> 00:54:14.760
Too many to count.

00:54:14.760 --> 00:54:16.050
- Jamelle Hill, yeah.

00:54:16.050 --> 00:54:18.870
- Now I think it was Jamelle
Hill, Kate Fagan, who

00:54:18.870 --> 00:54:22.770
does great stories
for ESPNW and more.

00:54:22.770 --> 00:54:23.882
Who are the other two?

00:54:23.882 --> 00:54:25.840
- But also, look at that
timing of that though.

00:54:25.840 --> 00:54:28.570
Late August, the Olympics
had just finished.

00:54:28.570 --> 00:54:30.000
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:54:31.680 --> 00:54:34.390
- It's what we would consider
the dead time in sports.

00:54:34.390 --> 00:54:37.710
But that being said,
women just have

00:54:37.710 --> 00:54:39.040
to seize those opportunities.

00:54:39.040 --> 00:54:44.190
You have to, even if ESPN is
calling you for the 5 AM call

00:54:44.190 --> 00:54:47.660
in, you take it because you
hope that that can lead.

00:54:47.660 --> 00:54:51.070
You have to build up your
repertoire in a way, I think,

00:54:51.070 --> 00:54:53.230
that men don't have
to to gain entry,

00:54:53.230 --> 00:54:57.270
to gain credibility within
the reporting world,

00:54:57.270 --> 00:54:58.880
and within the athlete world.

00:54:58.880 --> 00:55:03.590
Even if you're a Sue Bird,
you need to prove yourself.

00:55:03.590 --> 00:55:04.230
Just sad.

00:55:06.930 --> 00:55:10.270
- So we've been talking a lot
about the demand for coverage

00:55:10.270 --> 00:55:11.080
of women's sports.

00:55:11.080 --> 00:55:13.720
And I'm wondering a little
bit about the push side

00:55:13.720 --> 00:55:15.080
from the athletes.

00:55:15.080 --> 00:55:19.860
What struggles do female
athletes and their coaches

00:55:19.860 --> 00:55:22.070
have in getting coverage?

00:55:22.070 --> 00:55:24.440
Do they have
different strategies

00:55:24.440 --> 00:55:25.770
than male athletes do?

00:55:25.770 --> 00:55:28.330
What do you see from
that side of things?

00:55:28.330 --> 00:55:28.830
- Wow.

00:55:31.640 --> 00:55:34.810
I think female
athletes feel they

00:55:34.810 --> 00:55:37.500
have to be incredibly
accessible, incredibly

00:55:37.500 --> 00:55:40.380
available, all of the time.

00:55:40.380 --> 00:55:45.950
I think male athletes can
say OK, this is my day

00:55:45.950 --> 00:55:47.266
to talk after practice.

00:55:47.266 --> 00:55:48.890
I mean, I can't tell
you how many times

00:55:48.890 --> 00:55:52.040
I would go to Celtics practice
and Paul Pierce or Kevin

00:55:52.040 --> 00:55:55.090
Garnett or Ray Allen would
say, not talking today.

00:55:55.090 --> 00:56:00.510
You would never, ever, no
matter how big the star is,

00:56:00.510 --> 00:56:02.130
see that happen with
a female athlete.

00:56:02.130 --> 00:56:03.900
I went out to
Storrs, Connecticut,

00:56:03.900 --> 00:56:10.220
before the Olympics when the
US women's basketball team was

00:56:10.220 --> 00:56:11.440
having a training camp there.

00:56:11.440 --> 00:56:16.190
And these are the biggest names
in basketball in the country.

00:56:16.190 --> 00:56:18.640
And it was packed
with reporters.

00:56:18.640 --> 00:56:24.890
And I kid you not, I think media
access lasted two hours, maybe.

00:56:24.890 --> 00:56:26.240
Two, two and a half hours.

00:56:26.240 --> 00:56:28.820
There were people still
doing stand ups when I left

00:56:28.820 --> 00:56:30.650
at around the two hour mark.

00:56:30.650 --> 00:56:34.300
Every player was available,
whatever you needed.

00:56:34.300 --> 00:56:37.180
If you needed a 20 minute
interview, with X, Y or Z

00:56:37.180 --> 00:56:38.780
player, you got it.

00:56:38.780 --> 00:56:40.180
If you needed three 20 minute.

00:56:40.180 --> 00:56:42.270
I mean, there was no limits.

00:56:42.270 --> 00:56:44.090
And by the way,
this was the first

00:56:44.090 --> 00:56:46.500
of three days of
this training camp

00:56:46.500 --> 00:56:48.630
where they would do
exactly the same thing.

00:56:48.630 --> 00:56:50.510
So I think from an
athlete standpoint,

00:56:50.510 --> 00:56:52.500
one of the things
that happens is

00:56:52.500 --> 00:56:56.466
there's a feeling that you have
to be constantly available.

00:56:56.466 --> 00:56:57.840
I think there's
also the feeling,

00:56:57.840 --> 00:57:01.450
and I know female reporters
feel it, you can't say no.

00:57:01.450 --> 00:57:05.960
Even if it's not the best,
most ideal situation for you,

00:57:05.960 --> 00:57:09.970
you can't say no because you
never know where it will lead.

00:57:09.970 --> 00:57:13.390
And I think about this when I
think of some of the athletes

00:57:13.390 --> 00:57:15.500
I know who I would
not have thought

00:57:15.500 --> 00:57:18.410
were candidates for
ESPN's The Body Issue,

00:57:18.410 --> 00:57:21.690
but posed for The
Body Issue anyway.

00:57:21.690 --> 00:57:25.420
Because I think they felt
that this was, perhaps,

00:57:25.420 --> 00:57:28.420
going to put them in contact
with some ESPN magazine

00:57:28.420 --> 00:57:32.240
editors, help them and
their agent make connections

00:57:32.240 --> 00:57:34.720
with people in the media
that could be valuable

00:57:34.720 --> 00:57:35.479
down the line.

00:57:35.479 --> 00:57:37.020
I don't think they
necessarily wanted

00:57:37.020 --> 00:57:41.210
to pose for The Body Issue,
but they did it as a way

00:57:41.210 --> 00:57:43.320
in the door, which
is unfortunate.

00:57:43.320 --> 00:57:44.780
- Did that work for them?

00:57:44.780 --> 00:57:47.530
- It did work for one of them.

00:57:47.530 --> 00:57:50.020
She got more Twitter followers.

00:57:50.020 --> 00:57:52.550
She got more attention.

00:57:52.550 --> 00:57:56.130
But she also is
somebody who had been--

00:57:56.130 --> 00:58:00.340
the other thing is social media
is a big part of this, too.

00:58:00.340 --> 00:58:04.260
Female sports and
athletes, teams, athletes

00:58:04.260 --> 00:58:06.910
rely incredibly on social
media, because they

00:58:06.910 --> 00:58:08.620
don't have the TV deals.

00:58:08.620 --> 00:58:10.540
And if they do
have the TV deals,

00:58:10.540 --> 00:58:12.550
it's not a whole slate of games.

00:58:12.550 --> 00:58:13.830
It's here and there.

00:58:13.830 --> 00:58:15.700
So you have the sports media.

00:58:15.700 --> 00:58:20.220
Again, it goes back to the
all accessible aspect of this.

00:58:20.220 --> 00:58:22.370
So yes, it worked
for this one athlete,

00:58:22.370 --> 00:58:27.090
but this was at the end of
two or three years of her just

00:58:27.090 --> 00:58:30.330
being constantly on social
media, doing different videos,

00:58:30.330 --> 00:58:33.110
trying to put herself out there.

00:58:33.110 --> 00:58:34.950
Because she needed money.

00:58:34.950 --> 00:58:36.750
Because she needed
endorsement deals.

00:58:36.750 --> 00:58:39.380
She was trying to,
as a hockey player,

00:58:39.380 --> 00:58:45.660
she was trying to make
a living without having

00:58:45.660 --> 00:58:49.140
to take a second job that would
have cut into her training

00:58:49.140 --> 00:58:50.040
time.

00:58:50.040 --> 00:58:52.250
Because she was caught
in this catch 22

00:58:52.250 --> 00:58:54.170
that so many female
athletes are caught

00:58:54.170 --> 00:58:59.240
in, which is you either take
a second job as a coach,

00:58:59.240 --> 00:59:02.450
a private coach, assistant
college coach to help

00:59:02.450 --> 00:59:04.140
make ends meet.

00:59:04.140 --> 00:59:06.270
But that cuts into
your training time

00:59:06.270 --> 00:59:09.120
incredibly so you can't be
the player you want to be.

00:59:09.120 --> 00:59:11.130
Or you try to
figure out some way

00:59:11.130 --> 00:59:14.160
to promote yourself, get some
endorsement deals so you can

00:59:14.160 --> 00:59:16.510
devote yourself full
time to your sport,

00:59:16.510 --> 00:59:19.310
so you can be the
player you want to be.

00:59:19.310 --> 00:59:22.279
It's this constant catch 22
that female athletes face.

00:59:22.279 --> 00:59:24.320
- One thing that I thought
was really interesting

00:59:24.320 --> 00:59:28.256
that Dan said was about how
eight of the top ten highest

00:59:28.256 --> 00:59:30.630
paid women are tennis players.

00:59:30.630 --> 00:59:33.060
And I think that's a huge
credit to Billie Jean

00:59:33.060 --> 00:59:37.120
King and the stance that she
took many years ago to have

00:59:37.120 --> 00:59:40.370
equal pay to the men's program.

00:59:40.370 --> 00:59:42.720
And then I think the
US Women's Soccer Team

00:59:42.720 --> 00:59:46.600
in the 90s with Mia Hamm,
they took a similar stand

00:59:46.600 --> 00:59:48.490
that everyone should
be paid the same.

00:59:48.490 --> 00:59:50.849
And I think what
happened this past year,

00:59:50.849 --> 00:59:52.390
and you guys could
speak to it better

00:59:52.390 --> 00:59:56.930
than I can, after the
women won the World Cup

00:59:56.930 --> 00:59:59.440
and trying to take
advantage of that

00:59:59.440 --> 01:00:02.860
to make sure that they were
getting paid equally to men.

01:00:02.860 --> 01:00:04.420
And the response
to it was actually

01:00:04.420 --> 01:00:07.610
pretty surprising to
me in a negative way.

01:00:07.610 --> 01:00:11.390
But I think that--

01:00:11.390 --> 01:00:13.390
Shira and I were talking
a little bit about this

01:00:13.390 --> 01:00:19.020
before the panel how now we
were the same year and friends

01:00:19.020 --> 01:00:19.590
in college.

01:00:19.590 --> 01:00:24.680
But how now looking back,
we see we thought when we

01:00:24.680 --> 01:00:26.170
were in college it was equal.

01:00:26.170 --> 01:00:29.410
We had all the same
equality as athletes.

01:00:29.410 --> 01:00:30.620
And we didn't, right?

01:00:30.620 --> 01:00:33.030
And even as we've been
going through our careers,

01:00:33.030 --> 01:00:34.760
we thought it was
the same equality.

01:00:34.760 --> 01:00:35.910
But it's not.

01:00:35.910 --> 01:00:40.280
And I think that the young
women today in their 20s

01:00:40.280 --> 01:00:43.690
think that it's
equal, but it's not.

01:00:43.690 --> 01:00:47.920
And I think for
the female athletes

01:00:47.920 --> 01:00:52.530
today to take those stands like
Billie Jean King or the women's

01:00:52.530 --> 01:00:55.910
soccer team in the 90s
or again this past year,

01:00:55.910 --> 01:01:01.300
it feels like there needs to
be a broader awareness by all

01:01:01.300 --> 01:01:03.480
the female athletes
of the power of them

01:01:03.480 --> 01:01:07.070
as a group versus a one, whether
they're in an individual sport

01:01:07.070 --> 01:01:08.250
or in a team sport.

01:01:08.250 --> 01:01:11.280
I don't know if that ultimately
leads to more TV coverage,

01:01:11.280 --> 01:01:13.760
but I think it certainly
addresses what you just

01:01:13.760 --> 01:01:16.580
brought up about the
training and the things that

01:01:16.580 --> 01:01:21.380
were needed in order to continue
to compete at that elite level.

01:01:21.380 --> 01:01:22.750
- Great points.

01:01:22.750 --> 01:01:27.350
Yeah, the Billie Jean King
in the 70s and Title IX

01:01:27.350 --> 01:01:28.590
really resonates, too.

01:01:28.590 --> 01:01:31.950
And how that fight,
there wasn't a lot

01:01:31.950 --> 01:01:36.890
of progress from 1920
to 1970 probably.

01:01:36.890 --> 01:01:39.500
I think 1970, you would
know better than me--

01:01:39.500 --> 01:01:42.876
- 1975, which was the year I
was born was when Title IX--

01:01:42.876 --> 01:01:47.380
- And not too much before
that, women's basketball

01:01:47.380 --> 01:01:51.740
was not a full court
game, which is just

01:01:51.740 --> 01:01:53.660
crazy to think about now.

01:01:53.660 --> 01:01:54.840
- Just think about this.

01:01:54.840 --> 01:01:59.440
1980 until 1984 you didn't have
women running distance races

01:01:59.440 --> 01:02:00.170
in the Olympics.

01:02:00.170 --> 01:02:02.794
It was a fight for that because
they thought their ovaries were

01:02:02.794 --> 01:02:04.490
going to fall out.

01:02:04.490 --> 01:02:08.880
Not even that, in 2014 in
Sochi was the first time

01:02:08.880 --> 01:02:11.720
they had women's ski jumping.

01:02:11.720 --> 01:02:15.340
And it was just amazing to
hear about these women who

01:02:15.340 --> 01:02:17.670
had been ski jumping
for 10, sometimes

01:02:17.670 --> 01:02:21.750
12 years, saying it's
about gosh darn time

01:02:21.750 --> 01:02:23.700
that we're invited to the party.

01:02:23.700 --> 01:02:28.880
And there were still some
male European coaches

01:02:28.880 --> 01:02:32.250
who were saying this isn't
physically safe for a woman

01:02:32.250 --> 01:02:33.220
to do.

01:02:33.220 --> 01:02:35.396
And citing some
of the old 1940s,

01:02:35.396 --> 01:02:38.630
50s literature about
women's ovaries

01:02:38.630 --> 01:02:41.120
falling out when they
were ski jumping.

01:02:41.120 --> 01:02:43.720
You would read these
comments come across

01:02:43.720 --> 01:02:46.170
on the quote sheets in
Sochi and you'd be like,

01:02:46.170 --> 01:02:48.650
what decade are we living in?

01:02:48.650 --> 01:02:52.880
- But I think it's an
interesting point, because I

01:02:52.880 --> 01:02:56.150
can speak for myself,
just having grown up

01:02:56.150 --> 01:02:59.340
playing team sports, played on
great teams here at Harvard,

01:02:59.340 --> 01:03:02.730
and seeing what all of my
classmates and teammates

01:03:02.730 --> 01:03:03.950
and the alumni before me.

01:03:03.950 --> 01:03:05.620
Some of them are
here in the room.

01:03:05.620 --> 01:03:08.380
Some folks after me who
are also here in the room.

01:03:08.380 --> 01:03:11.930
Like what people now
believe that they can do

01:03:11.930 --> 01:03:13.040
and are afforded to do.

01:03:13.040 --> 01:03:15.010
And they've been
in this environment

01:03:15.010 --> 01:03:17.540
where they understand team,
which is actually really,

01:03:17.540 --> 01:03:19.752
really important in
a business setting.

01:03:19.752 --> 01:03:21.210
Sure, even the
approach that you've

01:03:21.210 --> 01:03:24.310
taken to looping in
the sports editors

01:03:24.310 --> 01:03:27.570
to make sure that you have
buy in from them before you

01:03:27.570 --> 01:03:28.810
go to the magazine.

01:03:28.810 --> 01:03:32.970
That's really fascinating and
politically astute, obviously.

01:03:32.970 --> 01:03:37.792
But it's something that as an
athlete you learn those things

01:03:37.792 --> 01:03:39.000
and you pick up those things.

01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:40.100
I'm not saying you
wouldn't learn it

01:03:40.100 --> 01:03:42.400
if you were devoting
yourself to anything else

01:03:42.400 --> 01:03:45.650
very seriously and passionately,
but I think just as an athlete,

01:03:45.650 --> 01:03:48.720
you start to learn
to think like that.

01:03:48.720 --> 01:03:52.740
And I think collectively,
we're starting

01:03:52.740 --> 01:03:57.570
to see people who were
impacted by Title IX getting

01:03:57.570 --> 01:04:03.150
to more senior levels in sports
business or sports journalism

01:04:03.150 --> 01:04:05.550
or sports media or
whatever it might be.

01:04:05.550 --> 01:04:09.260
And the hope is that some
of these things that we're

01:04:09.260 --> 01:04:13.030
talking about, even like Katie
Ledecky, the longest race

01:04:13.030 --> 01:04:15.010
that she was able to
swim wasn't as long

01:04:15.010 --> 01:04:18.604
as the longest men's
race, when are there

01:04:18.604 --> 01:04:20.270
going to be women in
those positions who

01:04:20.270 --> 01:04:22.120
can enact that
change and understand

01:04:22.120 --> 01:04:26.800
that there is no real reason
why that race isn't happening?

01:04:26.800 --> 01:04:29.910
- That brings up a question
I had for you guys, which

01:04:29.910 --> 01:04:31.870
is really about the
role of the Olympics

01:04:31.870 --> 01:04:36.540
in changing public perception
about women's athletics.

01:04:36.540 --> 01:04:39.810
We've talked a little bit
about the spike in interest

01:04:39.810 --> 01:04:41.120
and then the fade off.

01:04:41.120 --> 01:04:46.089
How do you see it in a
longer term perspective?

01:04:46.089 --> 01:04:47.380
- How do you see a longer term?

01:04:47.380 --> 01:04:50.800
I'll take this first,
only because I'm somewhat

01:04:50.800 --> 01:04:52.770
recently returned from Rio.

01:04:55.380 --> 01:05:00.620
It's tough, because I
think even at the Olympics

01:05:00.620 --> 01:05:04.030
you have a disparity there
in terms of the coverage

01:05:04.030 --> 01:05:06.190
that men and women get.

01:05:06.190 --> 01:05:08.320
And what's always
interesting to me

01:05:08.320 --> 01:05:15.070
is it's like the men will have
been followed much longer.

01:05:15.070 --> 01:05:17.350
You'll have more
of a story to them,

01:05:17.350 --> 01:05:20.450
you'll know more about them
going into the competition.

01:05:20.450 --> 01:05:23.450
And then the women
are not portrayed

01:05:23.450 --> 01:05:25.610
as overnight successes,
but they come across

01:05:25.610 --> 01:05:29.060
as overnight successes
because there's not

01:05:29.060 --> 01:05:31.440
that background,
that same lead-up

01:05:31.440 --> 01:05:33.360
with the female athletes.

01:05:33.360 --> 01:05:37.390
Even though I will be in my
editor's office eight months

01:05:37.390 --> 01:05:40.200
earlier talking about we
should have this athlete,

01:05:40.200 --> 01:05:41.970
we should have that athlete.

01:05:41.970 --> 01:05:49.085
They looked at me cross-eyed
when I said to them.

01:05:49.085 --> 01:05:52.130
Listen, this is not
just at The Globe

01:05:52.130 --> 01:05:53.730
or with male sports editors.

01:05:53.730 --> 01:05:56.000
Sometimes it's
just our awareness

01:05:56.000 --> 01:05:57.250
of female athletes in general.

01:05:57.250 --> 01:05:58.920
But they looked at
me cross-eyed when

01:05:58.920 --> 01:06:01.490
I said you know
what, we have got

01:06:01.490 --> 01:06:06.890
to do a feature on this
rower named Gevvie Stone.

01:06:06.890 --> 01:06:09.560
I said, trust me, we need to go.

01:06:09.560 --> 01:06:12.970
She's training in
Cambridge, it will be great.

01:06:12.970 --> 01:06:14.520
We should bring a video.

01:06:14.520 --> 01:06:16.400
And again, with the
access part of it,

01:06:16.400 --> 01:06:19.580
I said I know will
have unfettered access.

01:06:19.580 --> 01:06:21.860
So we got to get down
there and do this story.

01:06:21.860 --> 01:06:25.810
And they're like OK,
OK, but I don't know

01:06:25.810 --> 01:06:27.330
if they were so enthusiastic.

01:06:27.330 --> 01:06:30.270
And they ran it in one of
the dead weeks leading up

01:06:30.270 --> 01:06:34.750
to the Olympics so I don't know
if people even saw the story.

01:06:34.750 --> 01:06:39.026
And it turns out she
wins a silver medal,

01:06:39.026 --> 01:06:40.900
and it's the first silver
medal in that event

01:06:40.900 --> 01:06:42.410
I think in something
like 12 years.

01:06:42.410 --> 01:06:43.840
And not only that.

01:06:43.840 --> 01:06:48.420
The kicker was I talked
to her after the race.

01:06:48.420 --> 01:06:51.330
And she was an outside
medal contender, but not

01:06:51.330 --> 01:06:52.200
a true favorite.

01:06:52.200 --> 01:06:56.420
I said, to what do
you credit your win?

01:06:56.420 --> 01:06:59.330
And she says, the Charles River.

01:06:59.330 --> 01:07:02.120
And I thought oh, this
is a dream come true.

01:07:02.120 --> 01:07:07.080
This is the perfect Boston story
coming out of the Rio Olympics.

01:07:07.080 --> 01:07:09.700
But you had to press to get
that coverage in advance.

01:07:09.700 --> 01:07:12.180
I mean, they're great.

01:07:12.180 --> 01:07:15.050
It just kills me,
because I feel like there

01:07:15.050 --> 01:07:17.740
are so many better women's
stories because there are

01:07:17.740 --> 01:07:20.020
so many more
undiscovered stories

01:07:20.020 --> 01:07:23.850
out there because women
don't get that lead up

01:07:23.850 --> 01:07:25.640
that the men do oftentimes.

01:07:25.640 --> 01:07:29.080
Or they're not known
quantities before the Olympics.

01:07:29.080 --> 01:07:34.100
So I feel like there were too
many stories for me to even do.

01:07:34.100 --> 01:07:35.930
- Well, and I guess
I'll just say I

01:07:35.930 --> 01:07:38.710
think that's where we can
tie things back to data.

01:07:38.710 --> 01:07:41.920
And that's the great equalizer.

01:07:41.920 --> 01:07:44.050
I just thought I would.

01:07:45.480 --> 01:07:48.330
- You can start to see
what people are reading,

01:07:48.330 --> 01:07:50.330
and you see the impact.

01:07:50.330 --> 01:07:55.130
And even as I'm trying to help
justify business decisions,

01:07:55.130 --> 01:07:56.090
I'm using data.

01:07:56.090 --> 01:07:59.160
And this was stuff that
really wasn't there 10

01:07:59.160 --> 01:07:59.990
or 15 years ago.

01:07:59.990 --> 01:08:04.304
But even print, you couldn't
see the impact of an article.

01:08:04.304 --> 01:08:05.970
Now you can see what
people are reading.

01:08:05.970 --> 01:08:08.120
You can see the comments that
people are making on them.

01:08:08.120 --> 01:08:10.370
- Yeah, so I would say
though the one caveat to that

01:08:10.370 --> 01:08:14.250
and something that frustrates
me is data can also be a bit

01:08:14.250 --> 01:08:17.439
of a self-fulfilling prophecy
when you're in journalism.

01:08:17.439 --> 01:08:21.189
For example, we know when
people will get on a website

01:08:21.189 --> 01:08:22.140
and click on a story.

01:08:22.140 --> 01:08:24.279
We know the high traffic times.

01:08:24.279 --> 01:08:28.630
Well, if you're loading up
a story on a female athlete

01:08:28.630 --> 01:08:30.930
outside of those
high traffic times,

01:08:30.930 --> 01:08:32.680
those numbers are
going to be lower.

01:08:32.680 --> 01:08:35.000
So then it becomes this
self-fulfilling prophecy where

01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:36.810
you're not getting the clicks.

01:08:36.810 --> 01:08:38.960
So what can I do about that?

01:08:38.960 --> 01:08:45.090
- I'll go to ESPN real quick,
because there's a WNBA Game 5

01:08:45.090 --> 01:08:47.300
and I wish I watched
more women's basketball.

01:08:47.300 --> 01:08:49.300
But I was like oh,
this is a great game.

01:08:49.300 --> 01:08:51.729
And I go to ESPN thinking
it's going to be on ESPN.

01:08:51.729 --> 01:08:54.240
It was on ESPN2 and I was
like, are you kidding me?

01:08:54.240 --> 01:08:55.540
And it was an amazing game.

01:08:55.540 --> 01:08:56.831
I mean, it was an amazing game.

01:08:56.831 --> 01:09:01.167

for-- they didn't put it on the

01:09:03.240 --> 01:09:06.580
It's frustrating when you see a
story loaded up on any website

01:09:06.580 --> 01:09:09.160
and again, this is nationally.

01:09:09.160 --> 01:09:13.374
When you see and I scan papers
across the country and see what

01:09:13.374 --> 01:09:14.290
they're writing about.

01:09:14.290 --> 01:09:18.170
When you see, at 9 o'clock
on a Saturday night,

01:09:18.170 --> 01:09:22.010
you see a great feature
about some female boxer

01:09:22.010 --> 01:09:26.430
or some female wrestler loaded
up onto the Los Angeles Times

01:09:26.430 --> 01:09:26.939
website.

01:09:26.939 --> 01:09:27.870
And you're like, huh?

01:09:27.870 --> 01:09:28.870
- I think I've figured it out.

01:09:28.870 --> 01:09:31.140
You need to become the sports
editor of The Boston Globe.

01:09:31.140 --> 01:09:31.740
- Thank you.

I'm sure you guys have
lots of questions.

Come on up to the mic and

and give us your question,
that would be awesome.

- Again, I just want to say
something about The Globe.

01:09:57.190 --> 01:09:59.780
The important thing, though,
is places like The Globe

01:09:59.780 --> 01:10:05.210
and places like
ESPNW are trying.

01:10:05.210 --> 01:10:07.990
At least they are putting
a women's sports column

01:10:07.990 --> 01:10:08.860
out there.

01:10:08.860 --> 01:10:10.670
They are putting
ESPNW out there.

01:10:10.670 --> 01:10:12.820
Whether it's
ghettoizing it or not,

01:10:12.820 --> 01:10:16.790
they're getting people
to write that content

01:10:16.790 --> 01:10:18.610
and playing with it.

01:10:18.610 --> 01:10:20.019
It's a start, it's a start.

01:10:20.019 --> 01:10:21.060
- It's a two part battle.

01:10:21.060 --> 01:10:23.610
We have to do the
stories and then

01:10:23.610 --> 01:10:29.540
we can fight for front page
placement for the popular 9:00

01:10:29.540 --> 01:10:32.270
AM to noon Monday
traffic window.

01:10:32.270 --> 01:10:34.790
- So The Globe and
ESPNW are a little bit,

01:10:34.790 --> 01:10:37.270
they're not ahead of the
curve, but at least they're

01:10:37.270 --> 01:10:39.780
putting stuff out
there, trying to start

01:10:39.780 --> 01:10:42.690
something of a conversation.

01:10:42.690 --> 01:10:45.410
There are a lot of kinks
to be ironed out, though.

01:10:45.410 --> 01:10:47.990
- And it's not a 24
hour news cycle anymore.

01:10:47.990 --> 01:10:50.531
I mean, there's four
news cycles a day, right?

01:10:50.531 --> 01:10:51.030
- 4?

01:10:51.030 --> 01:10:52.350
About 12.

01:10:52.350 --> 01:10:53.290
- Yeah, 12, right?

01:10:53.290 --> 01:10:54.130
Even more.

01:10:54.130 --> 01:10:59.380
The big traffic stories are
here and gone in a heartbeat.

01:10:59.380 --> 01:11:02.630
These aren't journalistic
works of lasting worth.

01:11:02.630 --> 01:11:06.400
These are splashy headlines
with big names and scandal.

01:11:06.400 --> 01:11:08.636
- And sometimes that works
against coverage, as well.

01:11:08.636 --> 01:11:10.510
- It's an echo chamber,
too, and you're like,

01:11:10.510 --> 01:11:12.020
oh my god, we've
got so many clicks.

01:11:12.020 --> 01:11:13.350
We've got to keep doing this.

01:11:13.350 --> 01:11:14.700
Well, yeah, OK.

01:11:14.700 --> 01:11:17.750
You got a click, but did you
really make a lasting impact?

01:11:17.750 --> 01:11:19.650
Is this resonating
with an audience?

01:11:19.650 --> 01:11:21.950
No, it has broad appeal.

01:11:21.950 --> 01:11:24.680
It's like driving
past a train wreck.

01:11:24.680 --> 01:11:26.850
And so not to denigrate
all the stories

01:11:26.850 --> 01:11:30.160
that we do, but the best
stories are the ones that

01:11:30.160 --> 01:11:31.760
are going to be read today.

01:11:31.760 --> 01:11:34.480
They're going to be read
Saturday night at 9 o'clock.

01:11:34.480 --> 01:11:36.520
You can discover
it two months later

01:11:36.520 --> 01:11:38.800
because somebody
shared it on Facebook.

01:11:38.800 --> 01:11:42.140
Those are the kinds of
stories that Shira's doing,

01:11:42.140 --> 01:11:43.930
that were the most
important ones

01:11:43.930 --> 01:11:46.700
that we did at ESPN Boston.

01:11:46.700 --> 01:11:49.650
We need more clicks always
to be able to devote

01:11:49.650 --> 01:11:51.800
more resources to finding them.

01:11:51.800 --> 01:11:57.450
And really I am convinced,
maybe naive and too optimistic,

01:11:57.450 --> 01:11:59.820
I'm convinced that
quality storytelling

01:11:59.820 --> 01:12:00.900
is going to win out.

01:12:00.900 --> 01:12:03.040
Because we do have social media.

01:12:03.040 --> 01:12:05.210
Because people
can go more direct

01:12:05.210 --> 01:12:10.320
and because there are other
ways to get audience and get

01:12:10.320 --> 01:12:15.590
buy in from consumers that is
outside any editorial decision

01:12:15.590 --> 01:12:18.490
making placement process.

01:12:18.490 --> 01:12:19.530
That's my hope.

01:12:19.530 --> 01:12:21.180
I hope it works out that way.

01:12:23.878 --> 01:12:26.044
We've got to fight the
battle every day pretty much.

01:12:30.880 --> 01:12:34.930
- So I am Paula Lawson
Barksdale in class of '87.

01:12:34.930 --> 01:12:38.600
And I want to say that
first of all, this

01:12:38.600 --> 01:12:40.050
has been fantastic already.

01:12:40.050 --> 01:12:43.650
I am not an athlete, but
I'm a big sports fan.

01:12:43.650 --> 01:12:47.260
I'm the one who lives near Kerri
Walsh and loves the Patriots

01:12:47.260 --> 01:12:48.840
and was hooting back there.

01:12:48.840 --> 01:12:50.770
So I just want to say
how grateful I am,

01:12:50.770 --> 01:12:55.600
but also just for perspective,
even though clearly we

01:12:55.600 --> 01:13:00.630
have so far to go, as
somebody who is pre-Title IX,

01:13:00.630 --> 01:13:02.780
there's so much good stuff.

01:13:02.780 --> 01:13:05.090
I love that my dad
watching the Olympics

01:13:05.090 --> 01:13:07.412
is following the women's
stories as much as the men's

01:13:07.412 --> 01:13:08.370
and that sort of thing.

01:13:08.370 --> 01:13:09.280
And there's a lot
of great stuff.

01:13:09.280 --> 01:13:11.050
I work with high school
students preparing

01:13:11.050 --> 01:13:12.110
them to go to college.

01:13:12.110 --> 01:13:13.943
And I work with a lot
of recruited athletes.

01:13:13.943 --> 01:13:16.960
And my girls have at least as
many opportunities as the boys,

01:13:16.960 --> 01:13:19.970
and that is phenomenal
to me, it's great.

01:13:19.970 --> 01:13:23.390
So I remain optimistic, even
though I know we're only

01:13:23.390 --> 01:13:25.360
this far along on the path.

01:13:25.360 --> 01:13:26.940
But my question,
actually, and I hope

01:13:26.940 --> 01:13:29.560
it's not too I don't know what.

01:13:29.560 --> 01:13:33.790
But I was thinking about
this notion of sex appeal

01:13:33.790 --> 01:13:36.260
and how that in
many ways it does

01:13:36.260 --> 01:13:39.320
actually work for men, as
well, not to the same degree.

01:13:39.320 --> 01:13:43.700
I remember people commenting on
Larry Bird being unattractive

01:13:43.700 --> 01:13:46.960
and me thinking, that's not
really his frickin' job.

01:13:46.960 --> 01:13:49.080
Are you watching him play?

01:13:49.080 --> 01:13:51.450
And I was actually
wondering, Jessica,

01:13:51.450 --> 01:13:53.190
what you all are seeing.

01:13:53.190 --> 01:13:54.960
And not just
anecdotally, but are

01:13:54.960 --> 01:13:57.190
you looking at any
analytics saying, what

01:13:57.190 --> 01:14:00.290
does it do for our team
that Tom Brady is gorgeous,

01:14:00.290 --> 01:14:02.350
is married to a
supermodel, and he

01:14:02.350 --> 01:14:05.420
has that every guy
wants to be him,

01:14:05.420 --> 01:14:07.000
everyone wants to be with him.

01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:10.010
And what does that
do to the number

01:14:10.010 --> 01:14:12.760
of women who are wearing
number 12 jerseys in terms

01:14:12.760 --> 01:14:15.470
of merchandising and
viewership and ticket sales?

01:14:15.470 --> 01:14:18.120
Is that something
that you track at all?

01:14:18.120 --> 01:14:21.080
- We're not specifically
tracking his sex appeal,

01:14:21.080 --> 01:14:25.420
which I think is the question.

01:14:25.420 --> 01:14:29.170
No, he's arguably the best
quarterback in NFL history.

01:14:29.170 --> 01:14:32.490
And his jersey sales
are really impressive,

01:14:32.490 --> 01:14:35.980
both by the men and
women and youth.

01:14:35.980 --> 01:14:37.730
No, we're not
looking at-- I mean,

01:14:37.730 --> 01:14:39.870
it's an interesting question.

01:14:39.870 --> 01:14:44.410
But I think that he
is a very good person.

01:14:44.410 --> 01:14:47.810
I think people in
the media may not

01:14:47.810 --> 01:14:49.060
think he's such a good person.

01:14:49.060 --> 01:14:51.380
- I have a free Tom Brady
shirt, so I'm all in.

- We're on the same page.

01:14:54.150 --> 01:14:57.050
But I think, actually, the
Giselle thing has as much

01:14:57.050 --> 01:15:00.920
of a factor as anything
because she is so much

01:15:00.920 --> 01:15:03.860
bigger of a presence globally.

01:15:03.860 --> 01:15:10.290
We were going to make an entry
into China in 2007, 2008.

01:15:10.290 --> 01:15:12.640
I was over there three
times in six months.

01:15:12.640 --> 01:15:15.190
No one had any idea who
Tom Brady was, right?

01:15:15.190 --> 01:15:17.110
Because they don't
really play football.

01:15:17.110 --> 01:15:19.370
The NFL has been making
a big push there,

01:15:19.370 --> 01:15:23.320
but we said Giselle's-- I'm not
sure if they were married then,

01:15:23.320 --> 01:15:25.690
but husband or boyfriend.

01:15:25.690 --> 01:15:27.040
Oh, yeah, we know Giselle.

01:15:27.040 --> 01:15:31.390
So I think here where
football is obviously

01:15:31.390 --> 01:15:34.930
so huge in the United
States, it's very critical.

01:15:34.930 --> 01:15:37.760
But no, we're not
measuring his sex appeal.

01:15:37.760 --> 01:15:42.585
We are very much taking
advantage of his actual skills.

01:15:42.585 --> 01:15:44.960
One other thing I did want to
say real quick that I think

01:15:44.960 --> 01:15:48.050
is interesting as we're
going through generational.

01:15:48.050 --> 01:15:52.090
So I have two boys, they're
three and five months.

01:15:52.090 --> 01:15:55.190
But I bring them to a lot of
Harvard women's basketball

01:15:55.190 --> 01:15:55.690
games.

01:15:55.690 --> 01:15:58.390
Last March, during
March Madness,

01:15:58.390 --> 01:16:01.220
we turned on the
Men's Final Four.

01:16:01.220 --> 01:16:03.345
And he looks up and he says
oh, Harvard basketball,

01:16:03.345 --> 01:16:04.470
Harvard women's basketball.

01:16:04.470 --> 01:16:05.450
And I go, not exactly.

01:16:05.450 --> 01:16:08.360
But in his mind,
watching women's sports,

01:16:08.360 --> 01:16:12.240
and again, the influence
of me is normal.

01:16:12.240 --> 01:16:14.570
And he likes watching,
I guess he does.

01:16:14.570 --> 01:16:16.490
But he likes
watching or he thinks

01:16:16.490 --> 01:16:18.870
basketball is women playing.

01:16:18.870 --> 01:16:21.430
So I think that
there will continue--

01:16:21.430 --> 01:16:22.656
You said we're on the road.

01:16:22.656 --> 01:16:25.030
I think it's going to just
continue with each generation.

01:16:25.030 --> 01:16:26.160
- Oh, totally.

01:16:26.160 --> 01:16:28.630
Again, just being
pre-Title IX what

01:16:28.630 --> 01:16:30.700
I've experienced
versus of course,

01:16:30.700 --> 01:16:33.530
my kids have grown
up only thinking

01:16:33.530 --> 01:16:37.552
of women as being as athletic as
men and equal in so many ways.

01:16:37.552 --> 01:16:39.260
They're not ever going
to reach the level

01:16:39.260 --> 01:16:41.830
where they're going to realize
that it's not post-collegiate.

01:16:41.830 --> 01:16:44.231
But yeah, I'm
totally optimistic.

01:16:44.231 --> 01:16:44.730
Thank you.

01:16:44.730 --> 01:16:46.750
And I hope I didn't sound too
silly with the sex appeal,

01:16:46.750 --> 01:16:47.870
but I really was thinking.

and as a displaced Patriots

01:16:54.400 --> 01:16:57.256

are watching that game

01:16:57.256 --> 01:16:58.130
all over the country.

01:16:58.130 --> 01:17:01.024

when I was growing up

But I really do
wonder how much people

are watching Tom Terrific.

Just a thought, thanks.

- Well, he hasn't
confirmed that.

01:17:13.550 --> 01:17:15.889
I actually had to hide
my free Tom Brady shirt.

01:17:15.889 --> 01:17:17.430
I almost burned it
when he said that.

01:17:17.430 --> 01:17:21.870
But I'm just
separating that out.

01:17:21.870 --> 01:17:23.100
- Just a quick comment.

I'm Lynn Osborn.

I graduated from
Princeton in 1979.

You are not pre-Title IX.

01:17:29.020 --> 01:17:31.840
Title IX was passed
in 1972, I believe.

01:17:31.840 --> 01:17:36.425
And it was 1977 when
the ladies at Yale

01:17:36.425 --> 01:17:38.800
made us realize at Princeton
that we didn't have a locker

01:17:38.800 --> 01:17:39.320
room.

01:17:39.320 --> 01:17:42.560
But it didn't occur to
us until they did that.

01:17:42.560 --> 01:17:44.500
I have a question, though.

01:17:44.500 --> 01:17:50.020
It seems that the Symphony
Orchestra business

01:17:50.020 --> 01:17:53.090
realized after decades
that women just

01:17:53.090 --> 01:17:55.280
weren't able to play.

01:17:55.280 --> 01:17:58.210
That, of course, women
can't play like men.

01:17:58.210 --> 01:18:03.790
When they created a curtain
that the players played behind

01:18:03.790 --> 01:18:05.570
when they did their
auditions and now

01:18:05.570 --> 01:18:07.640
the symphonies are 50/50.

01:18:07.640 --> 01:18:10.760
I'm just wondering that your
data may be the way for us

01:18:10.760 --> 01:18:12.700
to move in that direction.

01:18:12.700 --> 01:18:14.270
- Yeah, I mean
obviously I've been

01:18:14.270 --> 01:18:16.480
a big believer in analytics.

01:18:19.280 --> 01:18:22.570
Understanding athletes,
understanding fans,

01:18:22.570 --> 01:18:24.220
customers, marketers.

01:18:24.220 --> 01:18:25.900
I do think it's
going to continue

01:18:25.900 --> 01:18:29.770
to help us understand where
our unconscious biases are.

01:18:29.770 --> 01:18:32.520
And I think being aware of
those unconscious biases

01:18:32.520 --> 01:18:37.652
in that example from this is
awesome and a great situation.

01:18:37.652 --> 01:18:40.110
I do think there actually are
physical differences, though,

01:18:40.110 --> 01:18:42.600
between male and
female athletes.

01:18:42.600 --> 01:18:46.700
But there are cases where they
can be as technology continues

01:18:46.700 --> 01:18:49.710
to advance and improve,
I'll be interested to see

01:18:49.710 --> 01:18:52.830
how it impacts and changes.

01:18:52.830 --> 01:18:55.300
- I would love to see
an experiment where

01:18:55.300 --> 01:18:58.660
you put together like
a series of pitches,

01:18:58.660 --> 01:19:00.350
and they're gender
neutral pitches.

01:19:00.350 --> 01:19:04.160
You don't identify whether it's
a male or a female athlete,

01:19:04.160 --> 01:19:05.870
and you just pitch
it to the editor

01:19:05.870 --> 01:19:08.130
and you see which ones
they come away with.

01:19:08.130 --> 01:19:09.120
- That is really cool.

01:19:09.120 --> 01:19:14.030
- And I think it would
probably be 50/50.

01:19:14.030 --> 01:19:16.550
That's what I'm guessing.

01:19:16.550 --> 01:19:18.570
Irrespective of
gender, I think you

01:19:18.570 --> 01:19:22.746
go for the better story
and maybe even 60/40.

01:19:22.746 --> 01:19:24.912
I think women's stories
tend to be more interesting.

01:19:27.960 --> 01:19:29.300
- Hi, I'm Jen Ballin.

01:19:29.300 --> 01:19:31.710
I'm a second year
MBA at MIT Sloan,

01:19:31.710 --> 01:19:34.120
also working on the Sports
Analytics Conference,

01:19:34.120 --> 01:19:37.580
and very interested in this
topic as a female athlete.

01:19:37.580 --> 01:19:39.260
Also interested in
the data discussion.

01:19:39.260 --> 01:19:41.176
So my question if
for you, Shira.

01:19:41.176 --> 01:19:43.270
You talked about
different, but better.

01:19:43.270 --> 01:19:45.510
So have you been able to
analyze through metrics

01:19:45.510 --> 01:19:47.590
on the sports column
what are these different,

01:19:47.590 --> 01:19:48.480
but better topics?

01:19:48.480 --> 01:19:50.580
And to that extent,
who's cooking?

01:19:50.580 --> 01:19:51.570
- Oh gosh, no.

01:19:51.570 --> 01:19:52.740
We have not done it.

01:19:52.740 --> 01:19:55.060
We should probably do
some serious analytics

01:19:55.060 --> 01:19:58.235
on the various-- maybe that's
a good-- are you interested?

01:20:01.030 --> 01:20:01.760
We have not.

01:20:01.760 --> 01:20:07.390
And part of the issue is
it's only two years old

01:20:07.390 --> 01:20:12.910
and would like to do more
of them more regularly.

01:20:12.910 --> 01:20:15.760
There's probably a
grouping now of about 30,

01:20:15.760 --> 01:20:20.430
35 to look at, if that.

01:20:20.430 --> 01:20:23.840
But I think it would
be interesting to see.

01:20:23.840 --> 01:20:32.100
I do know that the three
most popular columns have

01:20:32.100 --> 01:20:36.749
been one where I
talked about, I don't

01:20:36.749 --> 01:20:38.790
know if you're familiar
with the woman Sara Atar.

01:20:38.790 --> 01:20:42.570
She's a runner who competed.

01:20:42.570 --> 01:20:45.900
She's essentially a US citizen,
but she shares citizenship

01:20:45.900 --> 01:20:47.110
with Saudi Arabia.

01:20:47.110 --> 01:20:52.820
So she competed for Saudi Arabia
in the 2012 and 2016 Olympics.

01:20:52.820 --> 01:20:55.530
And that got a huge response.

01:20:55.530 --> 01:20:58.210
The other one was a
case of discrimination

01:20:58.210 --> 01:21:02.860
against a female
hockey coach who

01:21:02.860 --> 01:21:05.470
didn't have her contract
renewed after being

01:21:05.470 --> 01:21:11.320
the most successful college
hockey coach in Division I

01:21:11.320 --> 01:21:12.750
Women's Hockey.

01:21:12.750 --> 01:21:16.150
She also happened to be the
most highest paid women's coach

01:21:16.150 --> 01:21:18.240
in college hockey.

01:21:18.240 --> 01:21:21.100
And then the third one
that was the most popular

01:21:21.100 --> 01:21:23.660
was, I don't know
if you recall, but I

01:21:23.660 --> 01:21:25.600
don't think his daughter's
still here, Sara.

01:21:25.600 --> 01:21:32.470
But Dan Shaughnessy wrote
about how it was not worth

01:21:32.470 --> 01:21:36.056
watching the UCONN women's
basketball team play

01:21:36.056 --> 01:21:37.680
because you knew they
were going to win

01:21:37.680 --> 01:21:39.700
and it was going to be
like a 50 point blowout.

01:21:39.700 --> 01:21:41.700
And why, basically, he
didn't quite say this,

01:21:41.700 --> 01:21:43.000
but it wasn't competition.

01:21:43.000 --> 01:21:47.600
And they defeated the purpose
of having an NCAA tournament

01:21:47.600 --> 01:21:49.060
if you knew they
were going to win.

01:21:49.060 --> 01:21:53.670
And so very popular
column in response to him.

01:21:53.670 --> 01:21:56.790
And I actually called him during
the national championship game

01:21:56.790 --> 01:21:58.860
and said, are you
watching, and just

01:21:58.860 --> 01:22:00.379
wrote about talking
with him during

01:22:00.379 --> 01:22:01.670
the national championship game.

01:22:01.670 --> 01:22:06.070
And basically, with the point
I don't want to say attack Dan,

01:22:06.070 --> 01:22:08.070
but said, that's
an invalid point.

01:22:08.070 --> 01:22:12.386
And we have to
get past the point

01:22:12.386 --> 01:22:14.260
where women aren't
grateful for whatever they

01:22:14.260 --> 01:22:15.990
receive in terms of coverage.

01:22:15.990 --> 01:22:18.580
And a lot of women
responded to that notion

01:22:18.580 --> 01:22:22.810
of not being grateful,
but believing you deserve

01:22:22.810 --> 01:22:24.040
whatever attention you get.

01:22:24.040 --> 01:22:26.177
So I got a ton of letters.

01:22:26.177 --> 01:22:27.260
- That was a great column.

01:22:27.260 --> 01:22:29.595
Didn't you talk about
the women's national team

01:22:29.595 --> 01:22:30.220
in that column?

01:22:30.220 --> 01:22:32.705
- Yes, I did talk about
the Women's National Team

01:22:32.705 --> 01:22:33.330
in that column.

01:22:33.330 --> 01:22:33.830
See?

01:22:33.830 --> 01:22:36.231
Somebody read it.

01:22:36.231 --> 01:22:36.730
- Thank you.

01:22:36.730 --> 01:22:38.313
And thank you everyone
for being here.

01:22:40.530 --> 01:22:45.587
- Hello, Linda Robinson Class of
'72 and lifelong Red Sox season

01:22:45.587 --> 01:22:46.170
ticket holder.

01:22:49.660 --> 01:22:51.020
I have a question.

01:22:51.020 --> 01:22:54.240
And I'm obviously
100% with you guys.

01:22:54.240 --> 01:22:56.931
But this is a
provocative question.

01:22:56.931 --> 01:22:57.430
- Love it.

01:22:59.940 --> 01:23:02.820
- There's a whole question
between sports as competitions,

01:23:02.820 --> 01:23:07.570
sports is personal fulfillment,
which is really a team building

01:23:07.570 --> 01:23:12.710
growth thing we talk about
sports for schoolchildren

01:23:12.710 --> 01:23:17.970
and to some extent in college,
and sports as entertainment.

01:23:17.970 --> 01:23:21.480
I personally, perhaps I'm wrong,
believe that it's not just

01:23:21.480 --> 01:23:25.110
Billie Jean King's efforts
and the continuing efforts

01:23:25.110 --> 01:23:26.950
of other tennis players.

01:23:26.950 --> 01:23:28.920
But the fact that
there is no question

01:23:28.920 --> 01:23:31.920
that the women's tennis
game brings in the dollars

01:23:31.920 --> 01:23:33.760
and brings in the attendance.

01:23:33.760 --> 01:23:38.960
And it's often in years when
the men's game has been lopsided

01:23:38.960 --> 01:23:41.400
that people came to
see the women more

01:23:41.400 --> 01:23:42.650
than they came to see the men.

01:23:42.650 --> 01:23:45.280
So it was very easy,
in that context,

01:23:45.280 --> 01:23:47.390
to say women deserve
the same money,

01:23:47.390 --> 01:23:48.610
because they're bringing in--

01:23:48.610 --> 01:23:49.260
- Or more.

01:23:49.260 --> 01:23:51.360
- Or more, perhaps even.

01:23:51.360 --> 01:23:53.140
But

01:23:53.140 --> 01:23:56.000
- Same with women's soccer, too.

01:23:56.000 --> 01:23:59.390
I think it's the more
entertaining game in the US.

01:23:59.390 --> 01:24:01.140
The women's team is
far more entertaining

01:24:01.140 --> 01:24:01.760
than the men's team.

01:24:01.760 --> 01:24:02.676
- Certainly in the US.

01:24:02.676 --> 01:24:03.720
I agree with you there.

01:24:03.720 --> 01:24:08.250
But what do you say, and maybe
Dan could speak to this some

01:24:08.250 --> 01:24:11.480
because I'm sure he hears
this from his work at ESPN,

01:24:11.480 --> 01:24:13.330
we're in the
entertainment business

01:24:13.330 --> 01:24:18.238
and people aren't
paying to see these--

01:24:18.238 --> 01:24:21.740
How do you see your role to
increase the entertainment

01:24:21.740 --> 01:24:23.490
value, if I will say?

01:24:26.060 --> 01:24:28.980
- That's a great question.

01:24:28.980 --> 01:24:30.560
It's a struggle.

01:24:30.560 --> 01:24:34.770
ESPN, we are trying to maintain
that journalistic integrity

01:24:34.770 --> 01:24:39.320
of editorial operates in a silo.

01:24:39.320 --> 01:24:44.150
And business publishing
is in another silo.

01:24:44.150 --> 01:24:47.560
The reality is
that's impossible.

01:24:47.560 --> 01:24:50.570
It's a false dichotomy
because the leagues

01:24:50.570 --> 01:24:54.080
that we cover we're
paying billions of dollars

01:24:54.080 --> 01:24:57.210
a year to have the
rights to their product,

01:24:57.210 --> 01:25:01.640
to put them on their airwaves,
to sell advertisements to make

01:25:01.640 --> 01:25:05.800
up for those huge rights fees.

01:25:05.800 --> 01:25:07.680
Maybe I'm not speaking
towards entertainment.

01:25:07.680 --> 01:25:10.010
At the end of the day,
it is entertainment.

01:25:10.010 --> 01:25:14.130
It's infotainment, a
lot of what ESPN does.

01:25:14.130 --> 01:25:18.270
I do think that there are a lot
of great journalists that come

01:25:18.270 --> 01:25:23.120
from an old school print
tradition that are both

01:25:23.120 --> 01:25:27.090
in the .com and the
print and digital house,

01:25:27.090 --> 01:25:28.700
as well as on the TV side.

01:25:28.700 --> 01:25:33.090
So I do think journalistic
integrity has risen.

01:25:33.090 --> 01:25:36.690
But it's unavoidable.

01:25:36.690 --> 01:25:39.410
There's no solution,
it's impossible.

01:25:39.410 --> 01:25:43.220
When you're in bed
together, I mean

01:25:43.220 --> 01:25:46.560
there's any number of
stories that we can point

01:25:46.560 --> 01:25:50.700
to over the last ten years
where news coverage has been

01:25:50.700 --> 01:25:55.000
slow to develop because of a
certain player's indiscretion

01:25:55.000 --> 01:25:57.000
and what they mean to the brand.

01:25:57.000 --> 01:25:59.610
I can think about
one in particular

01:25:59.610 --> 01:26:02.290
with Ben Rothlisberger.

01:26:02.290 --> 01:26:05.110
- Rapes in Georgia, right?

01:26:05.110 --> 01:26:07.940
- And also in Tahoe in
the golf tournament,

01:26:07.940 --> 01:26:11.940
there was some slow reporting
there for an outfit.

01:26:11.940 --> 01:26:14.690
We're all in a
competitive business,

01:26:14.690 --> 01:26:17.620
everybody wants to be
first to break news.

01:26:17.620 --> 01:26:20.400
The reality is most of us
are all at the same access

01:26:20.400 --> 01:26:24.084
and we're writing the same
stories for men's teams.

01:26:24.084 --> 01:26:25.750
And so when it comes
to these situations

01:26:25.750 --> 01:26:30.420
where some of the biggest,
most valuable properties

01:26:30.420 --> 01:26:34.970
and entities are in
possibly compromising, less

01:26:34.970 --> 01:26:39.040
than favorable outright
illegal circumstances,

01:26:39.040 --> 01:26:42.400
there have been times when
the coverage has been slow.

01:26:42.400 --> 01:26:46.600
Now I can take some
solace in the fact

01:26:46.600 --> 01:26:49.810
that you can't avoid it forever.

01:26:49.810 --> 01:26:51.470
And there are people
in the room that

01:26:51.470 --> 01:26:52.849
are saying, why are we waiting?

01:26:52.849 --> 01:26:53.640
Why are we waiting?

01:26:53.640 --> 01:26:54.540
Why are we waiting?

01:26:54.540 --> 01:26:57.290
This is newsworthy
right now today.

01:26:57.290 --> 01:27:00.140
And every second
that we wait, we're

01:27:00.140 --> 01:27:02.850
losing credibility
with our fans.

01:27:02.850 --> 01:27:05.630
And we're losing that
mission to maintain

01:27:05.630 --> 01:27:07.330
journalistic integrity.

01:27:07.330 --> 01:27:09.950
So there's always that tension.

01:27:09.950 --> 01:27:17.495
Ideally, you're aware of it,
but editorially, those decisions

01:27:17.495 --> 01:27:19.370
aren't getting delayed
on the editorial side.

01:27:19.370 --> 01:27:21.920
It's not happening on that side.

01:27:21.920 --> 01:27:25.930
It's different than, I
don't know a quote unquote,

01:27:25.930 --> 01:27:27.080
"independent newspaper".

01:27:31.810 --> 01:27:33.880
ESPN is a funny
situation that it's

01:27:33.880 --> 01:27:36.710
one of the biggest rights
holders to all these entities.

01:27:36.710 --> 01:27:38.860
But it is still a
journalistic outfit.

01:27:38.860 --> 01:27:42.130
It's different than the NFL
network covering the NFL.

01:27:42.130 --> 01:27:44.260
It's different than
the MLB network.

01:27:44.260 --> 01:27:49.880
So I would say that those
entities that are really

01:27:49.880 --> 01:27:51.920
keeping their own
product and controlling

01:27:51.920 --> 01:27:55.280
coverage and access
in-house, they're

01:27:55.280 --> 01:27:56.860
all about entertainment.

01:27:56.860 --> 01:27:59.930
And you're not going to see
a lot of the negative stuff

01:27:59.930 --> 01:28:01.590
at all there.

01:28:01.590 --> 01:28:03.870
And that, to me,
that's their role.

01:28:03.870 --> 01:28:05.790
I can't argue with
their business model.

01:28:05.790 --> 01:28:09.160
That's why it's important
that the journalists that

01:28:09.160 --> 01:28:11.520
have a stake in this
continue to do their jobs

01:28:11.520 --> 01:28:14.872
and aren't handcuffed.

01:28:14.872 --> 01:28:17.080
I'm not sure I touched on
entertainment at all there.

01:28:17.080 --> 01:28:19.450
I'm sorry.

01:28:19.450 --> 01:28:24.250
- Yeah, I started
out by saying that we

01:28:24.250 --> 01:28:27.420
created different content
for women, that people

01:28:27.420 --> 01:28:28.789
consume different.

01:28:28.789 --> 01:28:30.580
And we created different
content for women,

01:28:30.580 --> 01:28:32.050
but found that it
wasn't just women

01:28:32.050 --> 01:28:33.760
who wanted that content, right?

01:28:33.760 --> 01:28:35.720
It was the general fan.

01:28:35.720 --> 01:28:40.860
I will say I would
go to ESPN pre-ESPNW

01:28:40.860 --> 01:28:42.700
to read the women's
basketball coverage.

01:28:42.700 --> 01:28:43.490
And it was great.

01:28:43.490 --> 01:28:47.500
It was how I like to read
about women's basketball.

01:28:47.500 --> 01:28:51.540
ESPNW then it got
flipped and they

01:28:51.540 --> 01:28:54.440
stopped covering women's
basketball that way.

01:28:54.440 --> 01:28:56.420
And it was no longer
on the main site

01:28:56.420 --> 01:28:58.003
and they were covering
it differently.

01:28:58.003 --> 01:29:00.640
I think in the last year or two
it's changed, which is good,

01:29:00.640 --> 01:29:04.420
because as a consumer
of sports, I didn't

01:29:04.420 --> 01:29:06.170
like how it was being covered.

01:29:06.170 --> 01:29:09.420
And it had been, as you
kind of said, something that

01:29:09.420 --> 01:29:10.910
wasn't being covered by ESPN.

01:29:10.910 --> 01:29:15.380
So I think that
we're in a generation

01:29:15.380 --> 01:29:18.180
of highly targeted
different ways

01:29:18.180 --> 01:29:20.490
of personalizing information.

01:29:20.490 --> 01:29:22.710
And I think the way
that things seem

01:29:22.710 --> 01:29:25.910
to be consumed from an
entertainment perspective

01:29:25.910 --> 01:29:28.130
is it isn't one size fits all.

01:29:28.130 --> 01:29:31.070
And I think that's what
we're talking about,

01:29:31.070 --> 01:29:33.250
that there might need
to be multiple ways.

01:29:33.250 --> 01:29:36.330
There are multiple ways that
men's sports are consumed.

01:29:36.330 --> 01:29:39.220
And we're maybe not there
yet with women's sports

01:29:39.220 --> 01:29:41.320
for a whole host of
different reasons.

01:29:41.320 --> 01:29:44.210
And I would say I might
be an oddity in terms

01:29:44.210 --> 01:29:46.370
of how I wanted to consume
women's sports the way

01:29:46.370 --> 01:29:48.280
that traditionally
ESPN had covered it.

01:29:48.280 --> 01:29:52.920
And I wasn't really interested
in how they were covering it

01:29:52.920 --> 01:29:54.570
for four or five years.

01:29:54.570 --> 01:29:58.910
But I think that's
something that you guys will

01:29:58.910 --> 01:30:00.970
have to speak to and evolve
and change over time.

01:30:00.970 --> 01:30:04.870
We have seen great success
at the Kraft Sports Group

01:30:04.870 --> 01:30:07.254
with what we have been
doing to try and cater,

01:30:07.254 --> 01:30:08.670
we thought was a
women's audience,

01:30:08.670 --> 01:30:11.840
but it actually turns out it
was much bigger than that.

01:30:11.840 --> 01:30:14.582
- Jessica, I think you
nailed-- sorry, go ahead.

01:30:14.582 --> 01:30:16.040
- Because there
are plenty of women

01:30:16.040 --> 01:30:18.730
who know the difference between
the theme and a skinny post.

01:30:18.730 --> 01:30:19.830
- Exactly.

01:30:19.830 --> 01:30:21.772
I'm not one of them.

01:30:21.772 --> 01:30:23.230
- I've got my eye
on the shot clock

01:30:23.230 --> 01:30:24.640
and I think it
looks like we have

01:30:24.640 --> 01:30:26.260
time for one more question.

01:30:29.800 --> 01:30:31.900
- Hi, I'm Danielle.

01:30:31.900 --> 01:30:35.930
I'm actually a junior at
LaSalle College over in Newton.

01:30:35.930 --> 01:30:39.030
I'm studying Journalism
and Public Relations.

01:30:39.030 --> 01:30:42.050
And as a student,
I obviously have

01:30:42.050 --> 01:30:43.810
watched the Olympics
over the summer

01:30:43.810 --> 01:30:45.960
while I had plenty of time.

01:30:45.960 --> 01:30:49.250
And I watched everything
to do with gymnastics

01:30:49.250 --> 01:30:51.880
because it's so good.

01:30:51.880 --> 01:30:57.620
And I notice how media
coverage with them

01:30:57.620 --> 01:31:02.240
was always about how
they were as athletes.

01:31:02.240 --> 01:31:07.100
Like Simone Biles, they talked
about her being an athlete,

01:31:07.100 --> 01:31:10.170
not sex appeal or anything
like that, which I thought

01:31:10.170 --> 01:31:12.560
was really good.

01:31:12.560 --> 01:31:17.300
But I had no idea who any of the
athletes on the male gymnastics

01:31:17.300 --> 01:31:18.090
team were.

01:31:18.090 --> 01:31:21.390
So I wanted to know
what your thoughts are

01:31:21.390 --> 01:31:25.720
on the flopped, the
flip flopped, way

01:31:25.720 --> 01:31:27.900
of media coverage
for some sports

01:31:27.900 --> 01:31:30.550
as opposed to other sports.

01:31:30.550 --> 01:31:33.597
With also women's volleyball.

01:31:33.597 --> 01:31:35.680
I never really see anything
about men's volleyball

01:31:35.680 --> 01:31:38.580
on the Olympics.

01:31:38.580 --> 01:31:40.280
- Well, it's
interesting that you

01:31:40.280 --> 01:31:43.040
talk about how they were always
talked about as athletes.

01:31:43.040 --> 01:31:48.170
But I think underneath, even
if it wasn't stated, part of it

01:31:48.170 --> 01:31:52.480
was the appeal of seeing these
incredibly athletic women

01:31:52.480 --> 01:31:53.840
in leotards.

01:31:53.840 --> 01:31:56.440
And I know there was
actually a male gymnast who

01:31:56.440 --> 01:32:02.060
said during the Olympics when
asked, what can the men's

01:32:02.060 --> 01:32:05.380
gymnasts do, here, to get more
attention, to take attention?

01:32:05.380 --> 01:32:09.160
He goes, we can compete
with our shirts off.

01:32:09.160 --> 01:32:12.600
And he actually did
take his shirt off

01:32:12.600 --> 01:32:14.040
for the exhibition portion.

01:32:14.040 --> 01:32:15.060
They held an exhibition.

01:32:15.060 --> 01:32:18.180
So I think as much as it
seems like on the surface

01:32:18.180 --> 01:32:20.440
there was coverage
that was devoted

01:32:20.440 --> 01:32:23.110
to these young
women as athletes,

01:32:23.110 --> 01:32:26.170
underneath that
was a layer of look

01:32:26.170 --> 01:32:28.440
at these women in leotards.

01:32:28.440 --> 01:32:32.050
I think the same thing exists
with volleyball, particularly

01:32:32.050 --> 01:32:33.540
with beach volleyball.

01:32:33.540 --> 01:32:36.530
Because I was over at
Copacabana and watching

01:32:36.530 --> 01:32:40.560
some of the men's contests and
some of the women's contests.

01:32:40.560 --> 01:32:44.580
And now listen, Rio's a
beach volleyball loving city.

01:32:44.580 --> 01:32:47.430
But the crowds were
just more into it.

01:32:47.430 --> 01:32:49.600
It was a more electric
atmosphere, at least

01:32:49.600 --> 01:32:52.760
for the matches that I went to,
when the women were playing.

01:32:52.760 --> 01:32:56.930
And I'm guessing part of that
is because of the bikini.

01:32:56.930 --> 01:32:58.700
So they may talk about
them as athletes,

01:32:58.700 --> 01:33:03.250
but I think underlying some of
the popularity of those sports

01:33:03.250 --> 01:33:07.680
is the sex appeal, whether
they state it on NBC or not.

01:33:07.680 --> 01:33:12.060
It's definitely,
definitely there.

01:33:12.060 --> 01:33:13.530
- Well, thank you.

01:33:13.530 --> 01:33:15.450
This is a great conversation.

01:33:15.450 --> 01:33:16.990
And I want to
thank the panelists

01:33:16.990 --> 01:33:18.466
and you, as an audience.
