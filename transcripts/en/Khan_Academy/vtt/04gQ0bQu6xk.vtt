00:00:00.388 --> 00:00:04.083
- Let's now jump into understanding
meiosis in some depth.

00:00:04.083 --> 00:00:06.647
So let's start with the germ cell.

00:00:07.523 --> 00:00:10.541
As we mentioned already,
a germ cell is a cell that

00:00:10.541 --> 00:00:14.454
it can either go to mitosis
to produce other germ cells

00:00:14.454 --> 00:00:18.761
or it can undergo meiosis
in order to produce gametes.

00:00:18.761 --> 00:00:21.582
So this is a germ cell right over here.

00:00:21.582 --> 00:00:24.101
Let me draw the nuclear membrane.

00:00:25.371 --> 00:00:28.327
Let me draw the nucleus
larger because that's where

00:00:28.327 --> 00:00:31.306
we care a lot about the chromosomes in it.

00:00:31.306 --> 00:00:33.175
And let me draw a centrosome

00:00:33.175 --> 00:00:35.589
which will play a role later on.

00:00:35.589 --> 00:00:37.505
I wanna do that in ...

00:00:37.505 --> 00:00:39.328
Let's see, I'll do that
in this blue color.

00:00:39.328 --> 00:00:41.947
Each centromosome has
two centrioles in it.

00:00:43.647 --> 00:00:45.859
I just wanna clarify
some of the terminology.

00:00:45.859 --> 00:00:48.459
And in the mitosis videos, I focused on

00:00:49.609 --> 00:00:52.282
cells of an organism, I
just kind of made it up,

00:00:52.282 --> 00:00:56.183
that had two chromosomes, that
had a diploid number of two

00:00:56.183 --> 00:00:59.747
that had one homologous
pair, that had one chromosome

00:00:59.747 --> 00:01:01.360
from each of its parents.

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:04.328
For this video, I'm
gonna focus on a species,

00:01:04.328 --> 00:01:06.070
not human beings, that would have

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:08.531
23 pairs or 46 chromosomes.

00:01:08.531 --> 00:01:10.953
I'm gonna focus on a species that has,

00:01:10.953 --> 00:01:13.414
that's diploid number is four.

00:01:13.414 --> 00:01:17.733
And so, let's say it has two
chromosomes from the father.

00:01:17.733 --> 00:01:18.917
And let me do that.

00:01:18.917 --> 00:01:20.329
I'll do that in this orange color.

00:01:20.329 --> 00:01:21.273
Now, I'll do that in the chromatin,

00:01:21.273 --> 00:01:23.177
I'll kind of depict the chromatin state,

00:01:23.177 --> 00:01:24.071
it's kind of unwound.

00:01:24.071 --> 00:01:25.925
So maybe it has a long one from the father

00:01:25.925 --> 00:01:28.513
and it has a short one from the father.

00:01:28.513 --> 00:01:31.230
And then it has homologous
chromosomes from the mother.

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:33.807
So it would have the
long one from the mother

00:01:33.807 --> 00:01:37.780
and it would have the short one

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:39.928
from the mother just like that.

00:01:39.928 --> 00:01:42.881
And obviously this is
a huge simplification

00:01:42.881 --> 00:01:44.726
but hopefully this
discuss the point across.

00:01:44.726 --> 00:01:47.722
So here, it has a diploid
number of chromosomes.

00:01:47.722 --> 00:01:50.434
So this is, let me write this down.

00:01:50.434 --> 00:01:55.088
This is diploid

00:01:55.088 --> 00:01:57.890
number is equal to,

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:00.026
we have four chromosomes.

00:02:00.026 --> 00:02:02.104
And then this thing, this germ cell.

00:02:02.104 --> 00:02:02.963
Let me write this down.

00:02:02.963 --> 00:02:05.470
This is a germ cell right over here.

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:08.164
It will go through interphase.

00:02:08.164 --> 00:02:09.882
So let me draw that.

00:02:09.882 --> 00:02:13.202
So it will go through interphase, in which

00:02:13.202 --> 00:02:18.202
it grows and it can replicate
its DNA and its centrosome.

00:02:18.229 --> 00:02:19.923
And so, let me draw that.

00:02:19.923 --> 00:02:22.210
So after it goes through interface,

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:24.962
I wanna use my space
carefully because I have a lot

00:02:24.962 --> 00:02:26.645
of steps to go through.

00:02:26.645 --> 00:02:31.428
After it goes through
interface, I am going to have

00:02:31.428 --> 00:02:35.760
in my nucleus here,

00:02:36.718 --> 00:02:38.831
my DNA will have replicated.

00:02:38.831 --> 00:02:42.848
So this long chromosome from my father,

00:02:42.848 --> 00:02:46.361
now all the DNA will have replicated so

00:02:46.361 --> 00:02:49.925
it may look something like that.

00:02:49.925 --> 00:02:54.567
And it's attached

00:02:54.567 --> 00:02:56.157
at a centromere,

00:02:56.157 --> 00:02:58.026
All these centro words,

00:02:58.026 --> 00:02:59.861
at a centromere right here.

00:02:59.861 --> 00:03:01.296
But I'm still trying to draw it in kind of

00:03:01.296 --> 00:03:02.620
the chromatin state.

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:03.672
It's actually all spread out.

00:03:03.672 --> 00:03:06.133
It's not bunched up so that
you can see it very clearly

00:03:06.133 --> 00:03:10.173
as these X's in a simple microscope.

00:03:10.173 --> 00:03:11.399
So it's just replicated.

00:03:11.399 --> 00:03:14.499
And after replicating, it
is still one chromosome.

00:03:14.499 --> 00:03:16.589
It has twice the genetic material

00:03:16.589 --> 00:03:19.166
but it is still one chromosome.

00:03:19.166 --> 00:03:21.580
That one chromosome is now made up of

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:24.320
two sister chromatids.

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:27.610
we talked a lot about
that in the mitosis video,

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:28.991
but it doesn't hurt to reinforce

00:03:28.991 --> 00:03:30.872
because it can get a little bit confusing.

00:03:30.872 --> 00:03:34.888
And then you have that shorter
chromosome from the father

00:03:34.888 --> 00:03:39.888
and then that also replicates
into two sister chromatids

00:03:40.008 --> 00:03:43.050
attached at a centromere.

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:45.847
So these are still two
chromosomes from the father.

00:03:45.847 --> 00:03:48.819
It has twice the amount
of DNA but it's containing

00:03:48.819 --> 00:03:49.887
the same information,

00:03:49.887 --> 00:03:52.139
just duplicate versions
of that same information.

00:03:52.139 --> 00:03:54.728
And the same thing's gonna
happen from the mother.

00:03:54.728 --> 00:03:57.259
You had that long
chromosome from the mother,

00:03:57.259 --> 00:03:59.244
homologous to this right over here.

00:03:59.244 --> 00:04:01.427
It's going to replicate.

00:04:01.427 --> 00:04:06.384
So it's now going to be
two sister chromatids.

00:04:06.384 --> 00:04:08.647
And then you have a short
strand from the mother

00:04:08.647 --> 00:04:11.027
that was homologous to
this one from your father.

00:04:11.027 --> 00:04:13.140
And that's also gonna replicate.

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:14.638
And so, it's like that.

00:04:14.638 --> 00:04:15.926
And at the end of interface,

00:04:15.926 --> 00:04:18.387
it would actually all be spread out.

00:04:18.387 --> 00:04:20.384
Once again, it won't be
bunched up into these

00:04:20.384 --> 00:04:22.183
clearly discernible X's.

00:04:22.183 --> 00:04:23.797
I drew them a little
bit that way, otherwise,

00:04:23.797 --> 00:04:26.281
because you would have trouble
seeing how that replicated.

00:04:26.281 --> 00:04:30.871
And we also have replicated our centrosome

00:04:30.871 --> 00:04:33.112
as we've gone through interface.

00:04:33.112 --> 00:04:34.679
Now, we are ready.

00:04:34.679 --> 00:04:38.591
In fact, now we are ready for
either mitosis or meiosis.

00:04:38.591 --> 00:04:40.391
But as I said, the focus of this video

00:04:40.391 --> 00:04:44.943
is going to be meiosis
so let's do some meiosis.

00:04:45.657 --> 00:04:46.709
So the first phase,

00:04:46.709 --> 00:04:49.888
so the first several
phases we call meiosis I.

00:04:49.888 --> 00:04:52.700
And the beginning of
meiosis I is prophase I.

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:55.207
So let's see what happens in prophase I.

00:04:55.207 --> 00:04:56.771
So prophase I.

00:04:57.717 --> 00:05:00.967
And so, let me draw the
cell right over here.

00:05:02.074 --> 00:05:04.907
So prophase I.

00:05:04.907 --> 00:05:06.625
A couple of things happen.

00:05:06.625 --> 00:05:09.005
The nuclear membrane begins to dissolve.

00:05:09.005 --> 00:05:12.831
This is very similar to prophase

00:05:12.831 --> 00:05:15.701
when we're looking at mitosis.

00:05:15.701 --> 00:05:19.462
So the nuclear envelope
begins to dissolve.

00:05:19.462 --> 00:05:22.783
These things start to
maybe migrate a little bit.

00:05:22.783 --> 00:05:27.705
So these characters are trying
to go at different ends.

00:05:27.705 --> 00:05:31.187
And the DNA starts to
bunch up into kind of

00:05:31.187 --> 00:05:32.883
its condensed form.

00:05:32.883 --> 00:05:34.565
So now I can draw it.

00:05:34.565 --> 00:05:37.340
So now I can start to draw it as proper.

00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:40.805
So this is the one from the father

00:05:42.076 --> 00:05:43.596
right over here.

00:05:43.596 --> 00:05:46.452
And this is the one from the mother.

00:05:46.452 --> 00:05:48.716
And I'm drawing, I'm
overlapping on purpose

00:05:48.716 --> 00:05:50.434
because something very interesting happens

00:05:50.434 --> 00:05:52.490
especially in meiosis.

00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:55.750
So it's the mother right over here.

00:05:57.360 --> 00:05:58.014
Let me see.

00:05:58.014 --> 00:05:59.675
Let's now do the centromere in blue now.

00:05:59.675 --> 00:06:02.973
That's the centromere.

00:06:02.973 --> 00:06:06.734
Now this is the shorter
ones from the father.

00:06:07.832 --> 00:06:10.907
These are the shorter
ones from the mother.

00:06:10.907 --> 00:06:12.800
And actually, let me just do
draw them on opposite sides

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:14.100
just to show that they don't have to,

00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:15.091
the ones from the father aren't always

00:06:15.091 --> 00:06:16.716
on the left hand side.

00:06:16.716 --> 00:06:20.072
So this is the shorter
one from the father.

00:06:20.072 --> 00:06:21.479
They couldn't be all on the left hand side

00:06:21.479 --> 00:06:23.096
but doesn't this all they have to be.

00:06:23.096 --> 00:06:24.734
And this is the shorter
one from the mother.

00:06:24.734 --> 00:06:27.391
And I will draw this overlapping
although they could have.

00:06:27.391 --> 00:06:29.446
Shorter one from the mother.

00:06:29.446 --> 00:06:31.814
And once again, each of these,
this is a homologous pair,

00:06:31.814 --> 00:06:33.975
that's a homologous pair over there.

00:06:33.975 --> 00:06:37.028
Now, the DNA has been replicated so

00:06:37.028 --> 00:06:40.255
in each of the chromosomes
in a homologous pair,

00:06:40.255 --> 00:06:42.415
you have two sister chromatids.

00:06:42.415 --> 00:06:44.886
And so, in this entire homologous pair,

00:06:44.886 --> 00:06:47.569
you have four chromatids.

00:06:47.569 --> 00:06:49.948
And so, this is sometimes called a tetrad.

00:06:49.948 --> 00:06:53.165
So let me just give
ourselves some terminology.

00:06:53.165 --> 00:06:56.426
So this right over here is called a tetrad

00:06:56.426 --> 00:06:59.351
or often called a tetrad.

00:06:59.351 --> 00:07:01.348
Now, the reason why I
drew this overlapping

00:07:01.348 --> 00:07:04.435
is when we are in prophase I in meiosis I.

00:07:04.435 --> 00:07:05.573
Let me label this.

00:07:05.573 --> 00:07:09.172
This is prophase I.

00:07:09.172 --> 00:07:11.772
You can get some genetic recombination,

00:07:11.772 --> 00:07:13.455
some homologous recombination.

00:07:13.455 --> 00:07:16.163
Once again, this is homologous pair.

00:07:16.163 --> 00:07:18.265
One chromosome from the father

00:07:18.265 --> 00:07:19.611
that I've gotten from the father.

00:07:19.611 --> 00:07:22.389
The species or the cell got
it from its father's cell

00:07:22.389 --> 00:07:24.780
and one from the mother.

00:07:24.780 --> 00:07:26.219
And they're homologous.

00:07:26.219 --> 00:07:28.123
They might contain different base pairs,

00:07:28.123 --> 00:07:33.123
different actual DNA, but
they code for the same genes.

00:07:34.355 --> 00:07:38.022
Over simplification, but in a
similar place on each of these

00:07:38.022 --> 00:07:41.609
it might code for eye
color or I don't know,

00:07:41.609 --> 00:07:42.839
personality.

00:07:42.839 --> 00:07:45.300
Nothing is that simple in how tall you get

00:07:45.300 --> 00:07:48.690
and it's not that simple
in DNA but just to give you

00:07:48.690 --> 00:07:49.909
an idea of how it is.

00:07:49.909 --> 00:07:51.755
And the reason why I
overlapped them like this

00:07:51.755 --> 00:07:54.831
is to show how the
recombination can occur.

00:07:54.831 --> 00:07:56.108
So actually, let me zoom in.

00:07:56.108 --> 00:07:59.011
So this is the one from the father.

00:07:59.011 --> 00:08:00.856
Once again, it's on the condensed form.

00:08:00.856 --> 00:08:05.012
This is one chromosome made
up of two sister chromatids

00:08:05.012 --> 00:08:06.289
right over here.

00:08:06.289 --> 00:08:08.054
And I drew the centromere,

00:08:08.054 --> 00:08:10.051
not to be confused with centrosomes.

00:08:10.051 --> 00:08:13.348
That's where they are, those
sister chromatids are attached.

00:08:13.348 --> 00:08:17.690
And then, I will draw the homologous

00:08:17.690 --> 00:08:19.895
chromosome from the mother.

00:08:19.895 --> 00:08:23.030
So the homologous
chromosome from the mother

00:08:23.030 --> 00:08:27.232
just like that.

00:08:28.052 --> 00:08:30.718
Homologous chromosome from the mother.

00:08:30.718 --> 00:08:33.876
And the recombination can occur at a point

00:08:33.876 --> 00:08:35.606
right over here.

00:08:35.606 --> 00:08:38.996
So after you're done
with the recombination,

00:08:38.996 --> 00:08:41.677
this side might look
something more like this.

00:08:41.677 --> 00:08:46.308
So let me draw it like this.

00:08:46.308 --> 00:08:48.456
So, they essentially break up

00:08:48.456 --> 00:08:50.639
and they swap those little sections.

00:08:50.639 --> 00:08:52.113
There's one way to think about it.

00:08:52.113 --> 00:08:56.340
So this one, we'll now have a
little piece from the mother.

00:08:56.340 --> 00:08:58.150
It might code for similar genes.

00:08:58.150 --> 00:09:00.576
But now it contains the
mother's genetic information.

00:09:00.576 --> 00:09:03.697
And then this one over here

00:09:06.384 --> 00:09:10.962
will now have the piece.

00:09:10.962 --> 00:09:14.548
And you could say even
homologous piece from the father.

00:09:16.190 --> 00:09:18.860
Let me do these two centromeres.

00:09:18.860 --> 00:09:20.032
And this is really interesting.

00:09:21.242 --> 00:09:23.437
All the time, there
couldn't be recombination

00:09:23.437 --> 00:09:26.897
and often times it can lead to
kind of non-optimal things,

00:09:26.897 --> 00:09:28.731
nonsense code and DNA.

00:09:28.731 --> 00:09:31.796
It might lead to a nonfunctional organism.

00:09:31.796 --> 00:09:36.149
But this happens fairly
common in the meiosis

00:09:36.149 --> 00:09:38.751
and it's a way, once again,
to get more variation.

00:09:38.751 --> 00:09:40.549
We've talked about sexual
reproduction before.

00:09:40.549 --> 00:09:43.370
And sexual reproduction
introduces variation

00:09:43.370 --> 00:09:44.868
into a population.

00:09:44.868 --> 00:09:46.934
And this, obviously, when different sperms

00:09:46.934 --> 00:09:48.954
find different eggs that
introduces variation.

00:09:48.954 --> 00:09:50.649
But then, even amongst homologous pairs

00:09:50.649 --> 00:09:54.666
you can actually have exchange
between this chromosome.

00:09:54.666 --> 00:09:57.255
And that's interesting
because as we mentioned,

00:09:57.255 --> 00:09:58.253
each of these chromosomes,

00:09:58.253 --> 00:10:00.830
they code for a bunch of different genes.

00:10:00.830 --> 00:10:03.024
And a gene is kinda
looking code for a specific

00:10:03.024 --> 00:10:05.891
or a set of proteins.

00:10:05.891 --> 00:10:08.306
So this right over here,

00:10:09.246 --> 00:10:11.053
and this is what I'm about
to say is gonna be huge

00:10:11.053 --> 00:10:12.364
over simplification.

00:10:12.364 --> 00:10:15.627
Maybe right over here
you coded for eye color

00:10:15.627 --> 00:10:18.308
or it was related to, or it
helps code for eye color.

00:10:18.308 --> 00:10:19.946
And then you got that from your dad.

00:10:19.946 --> 00:10:21.710
And here, it helped code for eye color.

00:10:21.710 --> 00:10:22.789
And you got that from your mom.

00:10:22.789 --> 00:10:26.191
Your mom might have trended
you towards a lighter eye color

00:10:26.191 --> 00:10:27.549
and your dad might have trended you

00:10:27.549 --> 00:10:28.907
towards a darker eye color.

00:10:28.907 --> 00:10:32.030
But now, the one from your
mom is on this chromosome,

00:10:32.030 --> 00:10:34.279
this gene, and then the one

00:10:34.279 --> 00:10:35.557
or they've both the same gene.

00:10:35.557 --> 00:10:36.717
They're just different allele.

00:10:36.717 --> 00:10:38.831
They're coding for different
variance of that gene.

00:10:38.831 --> 00:10:41.291
And then the allele from
your dad is over here.

00:10:41.291 --> 00:10:44.298
And once again, some people
get confused with genes

00:10:44.298 --> 00:10:45.612
and chromosomes and all of these.

00:10:45.612 --> 00:10:48.519
Each of these chromosomes
contain a bunch of genes.

00:10:48.519 --> 00:10:50.979
These are very long DNA molecules.

00:10:50.979 --> 00:10:53.626
This code for a bunch of different genes.

00:10:53.626 --> 00:10:57.434
So gene will be a little section
of here that could code for

00:10:57.434 --> 00:10:59.408
a particular protein.

00:10:59.408 --> 00:11:01.590
So that's what happens in prophase I.

00:11:01.590 --> 00:11:05.034
In prophase I, you have this condensation

00:11:05.034 --> 00:11:09.732
of your chromosomes, of
your homologous pairs.

00:11:09.732 --> 00:11:12.646
You can have this recombination.

00:11:12.646 --> 00:11:14.365
And it's really interesting,
this recombination

00:11:14.365 --> 00:11:16.120
doesn't tend to happen
at just random points

00:11:16.120 --> 00:11:20.149
that would kind of break
the genetic information.

00:11:20.149 --> 00:11:22.667
It tends to happen at fairly clean points.

00:11:22.667 --> 00:11:25.344
And the places where this
breakup is happening,

00:11:25.344 --> 00:11:27.515
these are called the plural,

00:11:27.515 --> 00:11:30.057
if you just talk about
one point, it's a chiasma,

00:11:30.057 --> 00:11:32.797
or if you're talking about
the plural, it's chiasmata.

00:11:32.797 --> 00:11:34.597
Sounds like it could be a horror movie.

00:11:34.597 --> 00:11:36.698
So, chiasma.

00:11:36.698 --> 00:11:37.835
Chiasma.

00:11:37.835 --> 00:11:38.996
And the fact that they happen,

00:11:38.996 --> 00:11:41.295
they tend to happen fairly
clearly, this is once again,

00:11:41.295 --> 00:11:43.713
kind of the beauty of
the universe or at least

00:11:43.713 --> 00:11:46.197
of biology is that through

00:11:46.197 --> 00:11:50.760
billions of years of evolution,
these things have kind of

00:11:50.760 --> 00:11:54.370
optimized for more variation and to happen

00:11:54.370 --> 00:11:56.239
in fairly clean ways.

00:11:56.239 --> 00:11:58.146
So I'm gonna leave this video right there.

00:11:58.146 --> 00:11:59.307
I know I just got to prophase I.

00:11:59.307 --> 00:12:01.907
But this was a really,
really important idea of

00:12:01.907 --> 00:12:06.272
this homologous recombination
or this chromosomal crossover

00:12:06.272 --> 00:12:07.828
that we see right over here.

00:12:07.828 --> 00:12:09.364
And then from there, we can continue

00:12:09.364 --> 00:12:13.410
through the rest of meiosis
I and then meiosis II.
