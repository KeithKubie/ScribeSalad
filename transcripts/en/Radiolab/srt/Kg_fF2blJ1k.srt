1
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:03,750
Oh, Hey, I'm Jad Abumrad,
I'm Robert Krulwich,

2
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:07,740
Radiolab today things. And our
next story involves one thing,

3
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:10,320
three people. Craig, I'm Craig childs.

4
00:00:10,370 --> 00:00:14,130
So you just heard I'm a writer and
traveler from western Colorado.

5
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:16,170
Ragan I'm Reagan Choi.

6
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:20,220
I'm an artist and a mother and
an educator know each other.

7
00:00:20,970 --> 00:00:25,640
Oh yeah, we're married.
Okay. And finally [inaudible]

8
00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:29,780
Derek Vaughn. I was a street
cop in a, mostly Denver.

9
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:31,690
Craig's a unlikely best buddy.

10
00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:33,250
I mean, if we'd had
been at school together,

11
00:00:33,251 --> 00:00:35,920
I would have just beat the shit out
of him in the playground, you know,

12
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:39,190
you know, we drive each other
mad, but in the end we can,

13
00:00:39,250 --> 00:00:41,080
we can still scramble around just fine.

14
00:00:41,150 --> 00:00:45,320
Part of what joined us is, were we
were in love with, with wilderness

15
00:00:46,330 --> 00:00:46,871
for years.

16
00:00:46,871 --> 00:00:50,440
They would take these trips together
out into the Wilderness of Colorado or

17
00:00:50,441 --> 00:00:51,040
Utah.

18
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:55,780
No maps, no GPS, no trails, no campfires.

19
00:00:55,781 --> 00:00:59,920
Even Derek and I would go off for
weeks in the desert together. Uh,

20
00:01:00,010 --> 00:01:03,880
I think the longest trip we took was
a month out just, just wandering,

21
00:01:03,881 --> 00:01:04,870
looking for routes.

22
00:01:05,210 --> 00:01:08,180
And it was on one of these trips that
they made a discovery that I think it's

23
00:01:08,181 --> 00:01:08,601
fair to say,

24
00:01:08,601 --> 00:01:12,650
still haunts them today and recently
almost killed one of our producers.

25
00:01:15,410 --> 00:01:18,500
So we'd been out for a couple of
days on this particular occasion.

26
00:01:18,501 --> 00:01:21,070
The three of them are together and
there are a couple of days into a hike.

27
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:24,890
Where are we again? Where in Utah is
that right? Yeah, Utah, I think desert,

28
00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:28,880
but rocky, slick rock,
sandstone cliffs, Canyon land.

29
00:01:29,030 --> 00:01:30,560
So they're hiking
through all these canyons

30
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:32,450
and, and we actually, we split up,

31
00:01:32,510 --> 00:01:36,440
Reagan said she wanted to set her own
camp and so she stayed in one canyon and

32
00:01:36,441 --> 00:01:40,310
Dirk and I popped over into the
next canyon over. Really? You just

33
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:43,940
does that? Is that a normal thing or were
you guys fighting? No, that's normal.

34
00:01:44,030 --> 00:01:45,110
We weren't fighting at all.

35
00:01:45,111 --> 00:01:47,850
It's one of the great things about
being out together is that, ah,

36
00:01:47,990 --> 00:01:50,770
there's an ease with that. [inaudible]
separating as part of that.

37
00:01:51,290 --> 00:01:55,970
Yeah. And I think Reagan was
looking at Dirk and me and saying,

38
00:01:55,971 --> 00:02:00,020
you guys are, are going to go
scrambling and get weird. Um,

39
00:02:00,910 --> 00:02:04,070
I, I'm gonna stay over here. I
don't know if that was the case.

40
00:02:04,310 --> 00:02:06,200
Well, part of it was just that I,

41
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:10,690
I was at least five months pregnant and
I was just starting to have a really

42
00:02:10,691 --> 00:02:15,130
hard time tightening my backpack so that
the weight wasn't all on my shoulders.

43
00:02:15,310 --> 00:02:16,900
And she says, well, she was hiking,

44
00:02:16,901 --> 00:02:19,940
the pregnancy hormones were giving
her bouts of Vertigo. It wouldn't,

45
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:22,240
it was just starting to hit her like, wow,

46
00:02:22,241 --> 00:02:24,340
in a couple of months things are
going to be really different.

47
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:28,240
So she needed some alone time. She
set her own camp, Dirk and Craig,

48
00:02:28,241 --> 00:02:31,750
meanwhile scale up this cliff face
to get to the next canyon over.

49
00:02:31,910 --> 00:02:36,170
And when we get to the very close to
the top and there's a little flat area,

50
00:02:36,550 --> 00:02:41,270
this balcony of rock
overlooking the Canyon below
this little ledge. So we said,

51
00:02:41,271 --> 00:02:44,690
well, okay, let's just sit here and
have some lunch, break out the pipe,

52
00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:46,460
smoking some pot. Exactly.

53
00:02:46,660 --> 00:02:48,310
So we sit down and, and

54
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:54,330
Ah,

55
00:02:54,330 --> 00:02:59,330
and we literally both have
like the first lung full when

56
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:01,900
Craig decides to take his backpack off

57
00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:05,620
and he leans over and I noticed
as I'm bending over a, uh,

58
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:09,480
a round object underneath
the edge of a [inaudible]

59
00:03:10,230 --> 00:03:13,100
bolder back under the
shadow and [inaudible]

60
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:17,190
he says, Hey, there's a pot under there.

61
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:23,340
[inaudible] straight vertically below
you. I'm eye to eye with it. And then I,

62
00:03:23,850 --> 00:03:28,850
I dropped to my knees and looked into
this shadow and there was this beautiful

63
00:03:29,490 --> 00:03:30,323
red

64
00:03:31,190 --> 00:03:35,410
jar, low and flat covered
and maybe 700, 800,

65
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:37,500
it'd be a thousand years of dust that

66
00:03:37,690 --> 00:03:41,740
it's a kindness called a seed jar with
just this narrow mouth on the top.

67
00:03:41,741 --> 00:03:45,760
And it had black paint design
around the, around the mouth.

68
00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:47,990
We're talking about a [inaudible]

69
00:03:48,690 --> 00:03:51,420
early Pueblo people, cliff dwellers,

70
00:03:51,450 --> 00:03:54,150
people who lived out in that
desert a thousand years ago.

71
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:56,750
And as he looked closer, he
could see that this particular,

72
00:03:57,170 --> 00:04:01,820
it had a crack down the front of it
and it had two holes drilled around the

73
00:04:01,821 --> 00:04:02,241
crack.

74
00:04:02,241 --> 00:04:06,470
And then a piece of Yucca twine had been
used to tie the holes together so it

75
00:04:06,471 --> 00:04:09,320
was precious to somebody. Yeah.
So they might have left it there.

76
00:04:09,350 --> 00:04:13,130
Maybe it was during a migration
thinking they would return at some time.

77
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:16,610
Maybe they were on the run, but maybe
someone was hiding it from other people.

78
00:04:16,730 --> 00:04:18,440
Yes. You don't know who it was,

79
00:04:18,441 --> 00:04:22,850
if it was male or female or what
clan or any of those stories,

80
00:04:22,851 --> 00:04:26,630
but you know it was a human being in
the same position that you're in right

81
00:04:26,631 --> 00:04:27,100
there.

82
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:29,920
Mm.

83
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:33,020
Doing the same thing, the same gesture.

84
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:41,470
You can see the hand reaching
out and placing the object.

85
00:04:43,370 --> 00:04:47,330
You can imagine the hands and the feet
and the people in the sounds that they

86
00:04:47,331 --> 00:04:48,164
would make.

87
00:04:52,770 --> 00:04:54,050
They stared at it for about an hour,

88
00:04:54,070 --> 00:04:57,570
not really saying much and then
suddenly it just hits Dirk.

89
00:04:57,930 --> 00:05:01,320
Oh wait a second, we've
got to move this thing.

90
00:05:02,310 --> 00:05:03,660
Somebody else was going to find this.

91
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:07,380
It just felt like if we can
just kind of luck into it.

92
00:05:07,410 --> 00:05:11,670
What's to stop some four wheel driving
by beetle villager from doing the same

93
00:05:11,970 --> 00:05:13,590
cause it's an access route. I don't know.

94
00:05:13,591 --> 00:05:15,870
I felt sort of protective
of it cause you know,

95
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:20,430
pot hunters were all over the southwest
looting dig sites and that jar would be

96
00:05:20,431 --> 00:05:22,920
worth a lot of money. Tens
of thousands of dollars.

97
00:05:22,921 --> 00:05:25,470
At least you don't have to make sure that
they somehow didn't get their hands on

98
00:05:25,471 --> 00:05:29,610
this. And so I thought, well let's
hide it. Crepe is like [inaudible].

99
00:05:29,740 --> 00:05:33,370
No, I said have absolutely not.
The moment we touched that jar,

100
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:38,080
it no longer is part of that story. It's
now part of our story. He's a purist.

101
00:05:38,140 --> 00:05:42,160
We, we do not move this thing, not
move it. Protect it. Let's cover it.

102
00:05:42,270 --> 00:05:46,780
Like I wanted to build a corral of
stone around it to like camouflage it.

103
00:05:46,810 --> 00:05:50,620
That's exactly what I'd be looking
for. In fact, I wouldn't notice the,

104
00:05:50,770 --> 00:05:54,000
the seed jar, I'd noticed the rock
and I would go, Ooh, somebody,

105
00:05:54,460 --> 00:05:58,340
somebody's hiding something. Yeah,
it right. Dirks looking at me going,

106
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:02,420
you and your Yoda crap.
God Dang. And he says,

107
00:06:02,421 --> 00:06:05,300
we could give this
another 700 years of life.

108
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:07,580
Hell it had been there
probably a thousand years.

109
00:06:07,810 --> 00:06:10,520
[inaudible] how do you resolve that?
Said, you know, we'll come back tomorrow.

110
00:06:10,521 --> 00:06:12,110
We'll just leave it for now.

111
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:16,780
Oh, so you left, you left in a draw.
We left in a draw and we actually, uh,

112
00:06:16,930 --> 00:06:19,090
hopped back over the
canyon to find Reagan.

113
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:23,470
Reagan's kind of like this bad ass
Samurai chick. I thought, wow. Oh yeah,

114
00:06:23,471 --> 00:06:26,980
I can, I'll be able to draft
Reagan over to my side.

115
00:06:26,981 --> 00:06:28,480
So they hiked back up to that ledge,

116
00:06:28,510 --> 00:06:31,990
yelled out for her and the next day
she hiked on over to where they were.

117
00:06:32,020 --> 00:06:35,020
I remember her hitching up her pants,

118
00:06:35,290 --> 00:06:38,800
pregnancy style and kind of
squatting down to get in there.

119
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:41,500
What was your first thought
when you saw it? Um,

120
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:44,733
focus

121
00:06:48,940 --> 00:06:49,250
[inaudible]

122
00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:52,130
and just being right there.
Completely consumed in that moment.

123
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:55,910
And I think it went on for a long
time cause eventually they're like, so

124
00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:03,200
what do you think when you hear the
truth? Like what we should do? Oh,

125
00:07:03,201 --> 00:07:06,020
you guys argued back and forth for at
least an hour and a half and I just

126
00:07:06,021 --> 00:07:08,630
ignored you for most of it cause I
was just looking at the seed jar.

127
00:07:08,690 --> 00:07:11,330
I wasn't really thinking to
be in the position of arbiter,

128
00:07:11,570 --> 00:07:14,660
but I just got fed up and I was like,
that's enough. You guys leave it alone.

129
00:07:15,530 --> 00:07:18,740
It's part of an ongoing story. Like
just give it up, leave it alone.

130
00:07:20,380 --> 00:07:20,520
[inaudible]

131
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:21,660
and so,

132
00:07:21,690 --> 00:07:26,340
so she takes some pictures
and we and we walk away

133
00:07:30,590 --> 00:07:30,980
[inaudible]

134
00:07:30,980 --> 00:07:35,570
and within a year of that moment,
everything just like went whirlwind.

135
00:07:35,990 --> 00:07:39,860
Reagan and Greg had a baby. Craig decides
to become a writer. He writes a book,

136
00:07:39,861 --> 00:07:40,940
it becomes a bestseller.

137
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:45,290
I quit the business and got
divorced and everything changed.

138
00:07:48,910 --> 00:07:53,740
But even on that day they knew with this
will be the center of things we talk

139
00:07:53,741 --> 00:07:56,350
about for the rest of our
lives. The seed jar. Yeah.

140
00:07:56,351 --> 00:08:01,340
The day we found the seed jar.
Do you think it's still there?

141
00:08:02,420 --> 00:08:03,650
I think it's still there.

142
00:08:03,950 --> 00:08:08,950
I think it is the route's pretty
complicated with that particular location?

143
00:08:09,450 --> 00:08:11,900
No, I'd say 50 50

144
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:13,970
taught. Huh?

145
00:08:18,810 --> 00:08:23,100
Again, if only that were
the end of the story.

146
00:08:23,910 --> 00:08:27,580
I don't know. He said he went, yeah,

147
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:29,880
we could have done the thing
where you're just like, oh,

148
00:08:29,881 --> 00:08:33,290
the narrative power of objects
met a blah blah. No, we were like,

149
00:08:34,010 --> 00:08:37,110
it's the damn thing there.
Or did someone take it?

150
00:08:37,170 --> 00:08:41,280
We got so curious about
this that we convinced Craig
Reagan and Dirk to go back.

151
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:46,290
Now they're here and check and we sent
our producer Molly Webster along for the

152
00:08:46,291 --> 00:08:50,810
ride. It's half the camp
is just around. Yeah,

153
00:08:51,180 --> 00:08:52,013
we've been,

154
00:08:52,590 --> 00:08:55,770
I didn't realize when they were like
giving each other a hug the night at camp

155
00:08:55,771 --> 00:08:56,130
and I was

156
00:08:56,130 --> 00:09:00,310
there with my recorders in
their faces that like was,

157
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:03,120
it was actually like a big moment.
I guess this is a reunion trip.

158
00:09:03,121 --> 00:09:04,380
We haven't seen Dirk in ages.

159
00:09:04,530 --> 00:09:08,730
Reagan had said that one of the last
times now that people have kids and

160
00:09:08,731 --> 00:09:11,800
families, one of the last times
you were together was the CJR.

161
00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:19,650
Yay. We're so happy. And so
they were really, really,

162
00:09:19,651 --> 00:09:23,310
really excited to like be together. Wait,
how long ago was this when they found,

163
00:09:23,311 --> 00:09:27,420
the thing is 11 years ago. This was
11 years ago. Yeah. So the kids were,

164
00:09:28,020 --> 00:09:30,060
Reagan was five months
pregnant and the kids,

165
00:09:30,061 --> 00:09:32,970
she was pregnant with his Jasper
turn off the light and come on out,

166
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:37,690
come say hi. Who's now let, he just
had his 11th birthday. Me Line back,

167
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:43,410
close the door and come say hi. Hi.
Hey Man, I'm Molly. We were on dirt.

168
00:09:45,180 --> 00:09:47,190
Derek had never met their
kids. Well he happened that,

169
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:51,660
but the last time you said Jasper, Jasper
was a baby. And the other thing is,

170
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:55,620
I'm just going to say
Craig and Dirk are like

171
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:58,980
brothers from another mother. Oh yeah.

172
00:10:00,810 --> 00:10:05,550
Like they are like the bestest
bro Man. Like every scene.

173
00:10:06,630 --> 00:10:09,450
They love each other so
much. So anyway, so we,

174
00:10:09,451 --> 00:10:13,790
so we get there and we'd like drop
our bags, we go to sleep and uh,

175
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:17,880
the sleep bag woke up,
four wheel drove or drive.

176
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:22,710
I don't actually know how it goes
out into the Mesas Park, the cars.

177
00:10:22,711 --> 00:10:26,520
And then we hiked a mile and a
half to the edge of the Mesa. Wow.

178
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:31,590
Basically the entire landscape felt like
they had just put me on a bonanza set,

179
00:10:32,750 --> 00:10:36,960
like gnarled wharfie trees, red, red,

180
00:10:36,961 --> 00:10:39,380
sandy sandstone there,

181
00:10:39,390 --> 00:10:43,050
you're on this Mesa and then it falls off
into this canyon and then there's like

182
00:10:43,051 --> 00:10:45,750
another Mesa and then that
falls off into a canyon.

183
00:10:45,751 --> 00:10:50,040
There's another mason than that and
it's just this like unending landscape.

184
00:10:50,290 --> 00:10:51,770
Bad luck. We're floating up here now.

185
00:10:52,230 --> 00:10:53,063
Yeah,

186
00:10:57,910 --> 00:10:59,050
and there shit, is it
just like [inaudible]?

187
00:11:01,310 --> 00:11:04,930
There's no sound cars license,
no sounds, no nothing.

188
00:11:05,620 --> 00:11:07,670
And is it intranet?

189
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:13,871
We don't know.

190
00:11:13,871 --> 00:11:17,920
We came out the top and across when we
went back to get Rick and basically our

191
00:11:17,921 --> 00:11:22,921
objective was to go somewhere into this
like canyon land down to where Reagan

192
00:11:23,411 --> 00:11:24,380
was camped before. Yeah.

193
00:11:24,450 --> 00:11:28,600
And come along there and somehow
find like a tiny little seed jar.

194
00:11:28,810 --> 00:11:32,560
It's weird to go back because I like to
think of it like this is going to change

195
00:11:32,561 --> 00:11:37,020
things if it's, if it's not
there, I'm going to be so mad.

196
00:11:37,270 --> 00:11:40,510
I like to be out in the world and just
think about it. Just go, okay, there's,

197
00:11:40,570 --> 00:11:44,260
there's a se jar sitting there under a
boulder right now and it will be there

198
00:11:44,261 --> 00:11:46,780
for the longest time.
And, and it's just quiet.

199
00:11:48,950 --> 00:11:49,783
[inaudible]

200
00:11:50,180 --> 00:11:52,990
then I can imagine that the
wind going around it and,

201
00:11:53,050 --> 00:11:55,380
and more sand building up and,

202
00:11:55,410 --> 00:11:59,620
and it's just this really nice
thought of isolation and perpetuity.

203
00:12:05,170 --> 00:12:05,460
[inaudible]

204
00:12:05,460 --> 00:12:08,840
hello. I kind of want to hear it echo.

205
00:12:09,140 --> 00:12:14,140
So we set up camp on the edge of a
Mesa and then we all went to sleep.

206
00:12:14,980 --> 00:12:19,610
W what's the Futon? Flute. That's Craig
apparently has a flute in his bag.

207
00:12:20,870 --> 00:12:25,790
Derek calls him flute. Boy. It was
weirdly appropriate. So anyway, so we,

208
00:12:25,791 --> 00:12:30,590
so we, we wake up like first
lights today. The day guys,

209
00:12:30,970 --> 00:12:34,900
today's the day we go find out if, uh,
if the egg is still there in the nest,

210
00:12:34,990 --> 00:12:37,490
today's the day we start hiking,

211
00:12:37,491 --> 00:12:41,180
we go down this 800 foot descent,

212
00:12:44,070 --> 00:12:48,650
whatever those rocks. No femurs
are broken and we strap this. Yeah,

213
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:54,100
the Anasazi were some tough people
like wind around this canyon on these

214
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:59,450
cliffsides through a saddle
in the back of another canyon.

215
00:13:02,310 --> 00:13:02,830
[inaudible]

216
00:13:02,830 --> 00:13:07,050
and how long did this hike take to
get out there? It probably took six,

217
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:10,290
maybe seven hours. Wow.
We're going pretty slow.

218
00:13:10,470 --> 00:13:13,530
The kids were amazing. Um,

219
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:18,560
but also slow cause it was starting
to like starting to bug Dirk.

220
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:22,650
I think it's the way to
say it. It's really hard.

221
00:13:24,790 --> 00:13:29,340
Seven straight overhead I think. Go into
up having to park the kids somewhere.

222
00:13:29,890 --> 00:13:30,340
[inaudible]

223
00:13:30,340 --> 00:13:31,990
sure enough at the end
of the six hour hike,

224
00:13:32,470 --> 00:13:36,170
I believe your pack so that they've
got extra water and snacks. Yeah. Uh,

225
00:13:36,210 --> 00:13:39,900
the kids need a break and so we sort of
believe them in an alcove on the side of

226
00:13:39,901 --> 00:13:40,734
the canyon.

227
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:45,540
What we'll spray out where it is and then
we'll get you so you guys go. Anyway,

228
00:13:45,570 --> 00:13:50,250
I brought my book. Okay.
Bye guys. And Reagan's like,

229
00:13:50,251 --> 00:13:53,640
all right boys, you have your emergency
whistles. Remember three times,

230
00:13:53,810 --> 00:13:58,400
but no joking. Okay.
Final ascent. You know,

231
00:13:58,440 --> 00:13:59,273
we went up. That

232
00:13:59,310 --> 00:14:02,200
ain't go, we went up that diagonal
there. I remember it. Really. Okay.

233
00:14:02,270 --> 00:14:03,890
Really clearly. I'm all behind you.

234
00:14:03,970 --> 00:14:06,670
So there's this, we were slammed
up against this canyon wall.

235
00:14:06,671 --> 00:14:10,150
We needed to get over it just to get
up and the only way to do that was that

236
00:14:10,151 --> 00:14:14,320
there was a boulder sort of out in front
of the Canyon Wall and it created this

237
00:14:14,350 --> 00:14:19,350
skinny little shoot and we had to wedge
ourselves into the shoot and like go up.

238
00:14:19,770 --> 00:14:21,880
And I think getting up on it, 60 feet

239
00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:24,810
don't think about their model.

240
00:14:28,700 --> 00:14:30,170
I'd like to get off this plans.

241
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:35,800
I had to like put my back against
one wall and there you go.

242
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:39,860
My feet against the other
push between the two walls.

243
00:14:40,010 --> 00:14:41,780
And I had this moment where before I left,

244
00:14:41,781 --> 00:14:43,820
Dylan told me not to die for radio lab.

245
00:14:43,940 --> 00:14:47,720
So I paused and I was like, okay,

246
00:14:47,721 --> 00:14:51,650
don't do this for radio lab yourself,

247
00:14:54,130 --> 00:14:57,920
just laying there.

248
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:04,920
It's every everyday now again,

249
00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:10,583
hi

250
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:13,980
time we get done with the gnarliest scent.

251
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:18,710
Everyone's like see is going to be
there cause no one else would do this.

252
00:15:19,310 --> 00:15:20,450
That was really hard

253
00:15:22,810 --> 00:15:26,450
to spot this whole down. I've been so

254
00:15:28,370 --> 00:15:31,730
Durkin Craig are like, okay, this is
it. We did that route. I am absolutely.

255
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:35,210
The seed jar should be
around here somewhere

256
00:15:35,940 --> 00:15:38,460
where like walking

257
00:15:39,110 --> 00:15:41,340
giant tumbled boulders looking under.

258
00:15:41,450 --> 00:15:45,920
You've got like a quarter of a mile
of canyon phase to figure it out.

259
00:15:46,130 --> 00:15:49,910
Just giant tumbled boulders.
Craig thinks it's to the left.

260
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:55,180
Dirk thinks it's to the
right. Anything Derek? No,

261
00:15:57,650 --> 00:16:02,350
it's weird because, does it look
familiar? Ah, this I, this is, this is it.

262
00:16:02,351 --> 00:16:03,184
This is this.

263
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:06,110
It's been 11 years.

264
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:08,760
Yeah, but I just, I know this is,

265
00:16:09,030 --> 00:16:09,863
that's fine. I know.

266
00:16:12,750 --> 00:16:14,090
Don't see the same

267
00:16:14,430 --> 00:16:16,570
bought. It's just getting
trickier and trickier.

268
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:22,720
You're like just going like really
confused work that far down. We did.

269
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:29,410
I've been lucky. I don't know for an hour

270
00:16:32,610 --> 00:16:36,150
and it all like looks the same but
just everything looks the same to an

271
00:16:36,151 --> 00:16:37,290
untrained eye. Right?

272
00:16:37,470 --> 00:16:42,090
It's like where's Waldo land and
we're trying to find Malto cover,

273
00:16:42,390 --> 00:16:44,850
find Craig, get his thoughts.

274
00:16:45,390 --> 00:16:49,830
I finally see Craig kind of far off
down the canyon standing by himself,

275
00:16:50,550 --> 00:16:54,780
just staring at the ground and
I was like, hey, like, okay,

276
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:57,730
and you lock. I went down
and looked at what would be,

277
00:16:58,110 --> 00:16:59,700
has been our likely route up. Yeah,

278
00:17:00,810 --> 00:17:04,590
which is right up through here and he
points to the ground like right where

279
00:17:04,591 --> 00:17:08,730
we're standing and he says,
I think it's like right here.

280
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,730
I think like this was the place.

281
00:17:14,910 --> 00:17:18,360
I don't want to think about
this particular possibility.
See all that stuff.

282
00:17:18,361 --> 00:17:22,560
I just walked across. It
went, yeah, that's all fresh.

283
00:17:23,580 --> 00:17:24,840
Oh, seriously? Yeah.

284
00:17:26,030 --> 00:17:27,710
Wait, what does that mean fresh? Well,

285
00:17:27,740 --> 00:17:31,670
we were standing on this
pile of really sharp rock.

286
00:17:31,970 --> 00:17:35,900
It was just all of these
sharp little jaggedy knives.

287
00:17:35,990 --> 00:17:39,130
I mean it sort of didn't look like any
of the other areas we had been in. Yeah.

288
00:17:40,630 --> 00:17:41,463
Yeah.

289
00:17:41,620 --> 00:17:46,620
It's possible that the cliff has
fallen here and covered everything.

290
00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:50,010
The top of

291
00:17:50,010 --> 00:17:51,870
that cliff,

292
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:55,630
if you looked above us to the top of the
cliff was like someone had just taken a

293
00:17:55,631 --> 00:17:58,510
meat cleaver to it. It
was just like sliced off.

294
00:17:58,630 --> 00:18:03,630
This whole thing broke off the entire
cliff face had fallen off and annihilated

295
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:11,250
everything. Hundreds of
feet in either direction.

296
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:16,120
It's been totally destroyed. Yeah,
I mean it wouldn't have survived.

297
00:18:16,930 --> 00:18:21,310
Even the giant boulder protecting it
like it's just, it's been wiped clean.

298
00:18:23,260 --> 00:18:26,170
It reminded me of like
an iceberg on caffeine.

299
00:18:26,380 --> 00:18:29,650
You see all those videos of like the
front of the iceberg just all of a sudden

300
00:18:29,651 --> 00:18:32,360
cleaves off. That's exactly
what happened on this one.

301
00:18:32,630 --> 00:18:36,890
So you're talking like 10,000
tons of rock falling here.

302
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:38,833
Just

303
00:18:46,010 --> 00:18:47,060
yeah,

304
00:18:49,810 --> 00:18:52,050
I mean I know

305
00:18:54,730 --> 00:18:57,580
that's not what I was thinking.
What's the possibility?

306
00:19:04,660 --> 00:19:06,260
And I'm not swallowing it just yet.

307
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:11,430
So he calls in Reagan, Reagan come Torta
and then Dirk comes wandering over.

308
00:19:12,450 --> 00:19:14,700
It does kind of make sense I guess. No,

309
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:19,950
if the pot's been here for 700
years, it does make sense at all.

310
00:19:20,050 --> 00:19:22,600
They would have, but no less 11 year.

311
00:19:24,420 --> 00:19:28,050
Why it's not looking right here.

312
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:31,950
It was right in here.
I know it was here. No,

313
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:35,820
no, no, no. Oh my God.

314
00:19:39,810 --> 00:19:42,030
Craig's like leaning against the wall.

315
00:19:42,660 --> 00:19:43,493
Hmm.

316
00:19:43,910 --> 00:19:48,210
Derek was like, wow man, I
guess I guess this must be it.

317
00:19:50,410 --> 00:19:52,650
And there was this real like it,

318
00:19:52,780 --> 00:19:56,200
we're grappling with something and I
was like trying to figure out like what

319
00:19:56,201 --> 00:20:01,201
they were grappling with and Craig just
kept talking to me like not actually

320
00:20:01,271 --> 00:20:04,120
about the seed jar, but about
the place. This is where, yeah,

321
00:20:04,260 --> 00:20:07,290
I remember Reagan hoisting up her pants,

322
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:13,040
pregnant squatting and Derek and me on
our knees looking in on this thing for

323
00:20:15,241 --> 00:20:19,020
the longest time. You know,
it was very clear in my mind

324
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:26,890
to have the place itself
gone. It's, I'm fine.

325
00:20:26,891 --> 00:20:29,260
It's beautiful, it's wonderful. But Jesus,

326
00:20:29,890 --> 00:20:33,460
this is a different kind of sadness
and it wasn't quite no. Are you sad?

327
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:39,130
Yeah. This kinda sucks.

328
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:42,690
[inaudible]

329
00:20:42,690 --> 00:20:46,470
if it was missing, if somebody had
taken it, that'd be a sad of like, oh,

330
00:20:46,471 --> 00:20:50,440
screw people. Why do you do this? This is

331
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:52,880
[inaudible].

332
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:53,810
This is gravity.

333
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:07,540
[inaudible]

334
00:21:07,540 --> 00:21:12,450
Derek's gone. We should
start moving. Yeah. Alright.

335
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:17,140
That's why I think it's perfect.

336
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:20,620
It doesn't seem like an
irony at all. Just let it go.

337
00:21:20,890 --> 00:21:24,490
You're going to break
into song. Let it go.

338
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:27,930
Pick a little TACO. G, G, g

339
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:33,190
c wants to hear what it
is. Like a mountain goat.

340
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:40,820

Hi, this is Frankie. I have
two things to destroy today.

361
00:23:16,630 --> 00:23:21,630
The first one is a beer Stein that I
painted at one of those paint your own

362
00:23:21,821 --> 00:23:23,950
pottery places with my
stupid ex-boyfriend.

363
00:23:23,980 --> 00:23:27,820
It's a stupid mug and it was a
stupid relationship. So here it goes.

364
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:30,353
Yeah,

365
00:23:33,150 --> 00:23:36,990
this is Jerry Miller calling from
Chicago. Noir tells me punching a wall.

366
00:23:40,030 --> 00:23:41,910
This is Carolina blue heart from Brooklyn,

367
00:23:41,911 --> 00:23:46,040
New York and made this flow with
the world. Did it when I was in high

368
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:48,560
school. Cause I always spend
a long time in my room and

369
00:23:51,950 --> 00:23:53,390
I don't know, things
are getting better now.

370
00:23:53,910 --> 00:23:57,320
Maybe it's time to like let go with
that part. So let's destroy it.

371
00:24:00,630 --> 00:24:01,463
[inaudible]

372
00:24:03,950 --> 00:24:08,570
my name is Mary and I'm going to destroy
a picture of me and my ex boyfriend.

373
00:24:11,150 --> 00:24:16,150
I am cleaning up all the paper work from
my classes and this is sound like me

374
00:24:18,650 --> 00:24:19,350
and beating them up.

375
00:24:19,350 --> 00:24:22,440
This is my father's one
of my father's computers

376
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:27,380
and this week it's three years since
the stroke that killed your father.

377
00:24:28,190 --> 00:24:32,090
So we're going to be out
of it with a hammer. Yes.

378
00:24:42,470 --> 00:24:46,250
That was satisfying. My
name is Justin. Last year,

379
00:24:46,310 --> 00:24:50,960
my life was like a country song. First
I lost my girl, then I lost my job,

380
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:54,170
then I lost my house.
Then my dog got killed,

381
00:24:54,890 --> 00:24:57,200
and this is the sound of
me destroying my old life.

382
00:25:14,550 --> 00:25:14,940
Thank you.
