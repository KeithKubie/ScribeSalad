here we go I mean this is the perfect
example every single time we're here we

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:18.150
example every single time we're here we
 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:21.050
example every single time we're here we
have what a 2030 minute maybe one hour

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.060

I shine lasers exactly one foot apart

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969
I shine lasers exactly one foot apart
 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:45.889
I shine lasers exactly one foot apart
onto the croc I then take a picture of

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899
onto the croc I then take a picture of
 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:50.090
onto the croc I then take a picture of
the crocodile dots and all then I load

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100
the crocodile dots and all then I load
 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:53.630
the crocodile dots and all then I load
the picture into my computer based on

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640
the picture into my computer based on
 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.670

the giant I'm after but it's a chance to

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140
the giant I'm after but it's a chance to
 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:10.640
the giant I'm after but it's a chance to
test the laser Cam's accuracy that is if

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650
test the laser Cam's accuracy that is if
 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:12.890

and that's what happened we won't have

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:52.970
and that's what happened we won't have
 

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:55.089
and that's what happened we won't have
many opportunities before the croc gets

up to lose to hold the crotch until we
 

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:32.370
up to lose to hold the crotch until we
get down to hell but it's pulling her

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:32.380
get down to hell but it's pulling her
 

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:34.710
get down to hell but it's pulling her
into the river she calls my cameraman

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:34.720
into the river she calls my cameraman
 

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:40.300
into the river she calls my cameraman
Brian over help me but I um help me

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:40.310
 
 

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:49.290

I add a second road but the croc just
 

00:03:53.680 --> 00:04:01.710
I add a second road but the croc just
fights even harder there's no way we'll

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:01.720
fights even harder there's no way we'll
 

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:04.700

behind us we got a big croc moving in
 

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:34.590
behind us we got a big croc moving in
right behind us I hope we come out of

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:34.600
right behind us I hope we come out of
 

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:39.680
right behind us I hope we come out of
this one in one piece

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:39.690
