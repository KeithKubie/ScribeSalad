00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Talking about error is something that we do all the time in physics.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
It's a very important skill to have,

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.000
but it's not as obvious or straightforward as it may seem.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
Here, Plato's guess was 74,000 km.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
The true circumference is 40,000.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000
Well, how are we going to state this error?

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
There are a few options.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000
We could say Plato overestimated the circumference by 34,000 km.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.000
We could say the true circumference is about half of what Plato calculated.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.000
Or we could say that Plato's guess was 85% larger than the true circumference.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:42.000
Now, all of these statements are true, and they all talk about Plato's error

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
in making his guess about the circumference of the earth.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.000
Now, my question is which of these do you think is most informative?

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
If we're trying to gauge the accuracy of Plato's guess,

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
which of these three statements is the best quantification of Plato's error?

00:00:56.000 --> 99:59:59.000
I realize this is somewhat subjective.
