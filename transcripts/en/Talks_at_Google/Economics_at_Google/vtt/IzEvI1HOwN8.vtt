[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:15.420
SPEAKER 1: Hello, everyone.

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:18.740
Welcome to another great
episode of Talks at Google.

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:21.710
We have a really special guest
here today, Mr. Tom Russo.

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:23.330
He needs no introduction.

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:26.330
Mr. Tom Russo of Gardner,
Russo and Gardner

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:28.232
is an exceptional
value investor.

00:00:28.232 --> 00:00:29.690
He graduated from
Dartmouth College

00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:32.450
with a degree in
history and Stanford

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:34.470
with degrees in
law and business.

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:37.890
He has previously spoken
at Google about investing.

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:40.880
From the last time he
was here last summer,

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:43.700
he was awarded the Graham and
Dodd, Murray, Greenwald Prize

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:44.880
for Value Investing.

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:47.030
He also serves as
a charter member

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:49.640
of the Advisory Board
of the Heilbrunn Center

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:51.680
at the Columbia
School of Business.

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:53.990
Today he will touch upon
two very important aspects

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:55.110
of his investing.

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:58.130
First, the reduction
of agency costs.

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:59.720
The only thing
that comes to mind

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:02.660
when people say agency costs
is Mr. Warren Buffett's quote,

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:04.239
"Lethargy bordering on sloth--

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:05.030
TOM RUSSO: [LAUGHS]

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:06.950
SPEAKER 1: --remains
the cornerstone

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:08.630
of our investment style."

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:12.160
Mr. Russo is an exemplar of
the buy and hold strategy

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:14.990
and has held many of his
positions for decades.

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:18.050
Secondly, he will talk about
the capacity to reinvest.

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:21.260
In doing so, he'll
touch upon factors

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:23.030
which form a sort of
a checklist for him

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:25.230
as he makes his decisions.

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:27.957
It gives me great pleasure
to introduce Tom Russo.

00:01:27.957 --> 00:01:29.540
TOM RUSSO: Thank you
very much indeed.

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:33.227
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:33.227 --> 00:01:36.010
Speaking here-- it
reminds me of what

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:39.460
it must have been like at the
catacombs of ancient Rome,

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:42.440
where there were
people sort of who

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:45.610
were underground because of
the Roman army marching above.

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:48.340
And they were pursuing their
own novel view of the world,

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:52.420
and the concept that within
the one company in the world

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:55.084
has more information
than anywhere else,

00:01:55.084 --> 00:01:56.500
there's a group
of people here who

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:01.090
believe that information can
help you invest wisely as a way

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:05.890
to add value, compared to the
migration towards passive,

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:08.710
the passive investors
who are the, in fact,

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:10.419
Roman army above us.

00:02:10.419 --> 00:02:12.400
Here we said, we'll
talk about why

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:14.740
it is that you can
hope to make money

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:19.120
by investing with a
substantial point of view.

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:20.560
So it's fun to be here.

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:23.800
I'm delighted to have
been asked to join, again.

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:27.430
I'm going to really just
jump right in and spend

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:29.680
a little time on
what I typically

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:32.380
spend most of my time
talking about, which

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:35.080
is a three part
process of what it is

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:37.150
that I look for in investing.

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:40.030
Because I've given a bit
of the same talk earlier,

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:42.962
and Sarab thought it might
be interesting to touch

00:02:42.962 --> 00:02:43.920
on some other thoughts.

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:48.130
So in addition to what we'll
go through at the start,

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:52.565
I've supplemented the comments
with things I most worry about.

00:02:52.565 --> 00:02:54.190
And they're in the
form of a checklist,

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:56.570
and then mistakes
that I've made.

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:58.810
Hopefully, we'll
run out of time,

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:01.040
and I won't get to the
mistakes that I've made.

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:04.100
But to start off, I
had the great fortune

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:08.380
of having grown up in
the investment business.

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:10.930
After Dartmouth College,
I worked on Wall Street

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:13.600
during a period of time when
inflation was notorious.

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:17.600
It was 1977 to 1979, 1980.

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:20.660
And interest rates
went from 6% to 18%.

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:23.170
And you know, you're
seared as an investor

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:26.530
by what you experience when
you're first starting out.

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:28.220
That was an
extraordinary experience.

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:30.760
I suspect those
in your generation

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:34.000
who fall prey to
bitcoin may end up

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:38.126
seeing similar painful moments
in the investment business.

00:03:38.126 --> 00:03:40.000
And you'll learn very
good lessons from that.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.510
But watching the
fixed income markets

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:47.130
really writhe during my
training was terrific.

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:49.570
I went back to Stanford
business and law school

00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:53.160
and had the great good
fortune at both schools

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:55.750
to have spent time
with two legends.

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:59.012
At Stanford Law
School, Charlie Munger

00:03:59.012 --> 00:04:00.220
was on the board of visitors.

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:02.020
And I had a chance
to meet with him when

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:03.880
I was launching my
investing career,

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:06.100
and he was very influential.

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:10.060
Then Warren Buffett came to
our value investing seminar.

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:12.160
And I think that's
really the thing that

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:15.670
confirmed for me the
approach to investing

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:19.060
would be characterized
by sloth and lethargy,

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:21.820
and all of the other
sins of inactivity.

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:25.660
Because what they described
was an investment process which

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:27.880
was very long term minded.

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:32.590
And you know, if you look at
the first slide, when I arrived,

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:37.090
Warren was really just moving
from the world of $0.50 dollar

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:41.290
bill investing to
franchise investments.

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:42.790
Franchise investing,
where there is

00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:46.930
economic goodwill
that yields a return

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:49.690
above what a commodity would.

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:53.920
And so the $0.50 dollar bill
approach that typified early

00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:56.050
value investors doesn't scale.

00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:57.660
And it's taxable.

00:04:57.660 --> 00:05:01.210
And the first point Warren made
to our class was the government

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:03.700
only gives you one
break as an investor.

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:09.820
That's the tax deferral
on unrealized gains.

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:12.850
And so if you can find a
business that has the ability

00:05:12.850 --> 00:05:16.840
to reinvest its current cash
flow into creating greater

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:19.277
wealth, and you don't
have to sell those shares,

00:05:19.277 --> 00:05:20.360
you don't have to pay tax.

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:21.250
That's very profound.

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:23.860
Most people with very
high turnover portfolios

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:26.200
just don't get it.

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:27.050
So that's one thing.

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:28.633
The second point is,
though, if you're

00:05:28.633 --> 00:05:31.180
going to depend on
that reinvestment,

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:33.970
then the person who runs
the business for you,

00:05:33.970 --> 00:05:37.580
the actual management,
has to be trustworthy.

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:40.180
They're your
agents, managements,

00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:42.790
and if they don't
represent your interests,

00:05:42.790 --> 00:05:45.380
then the process won't work.

00:05:45.380 --> 00:05:48.540
They must be owner minded.

00:05:48.540 --> 00:05:51.090
And then the next
thing you'll need

00:05:51.090 --> 00:05:53.801
if you're going to
buy and hold, is

00:05:53.801 --> 00:05:55.300
you have to have a
business that has

00:05:55.300 --> 00:06:00.520
a competitive mode, a business
that will absorb reinvestment,

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:03.310
and return you for it.

00:06:03.310 --> 00:06:05.560
And so, for example,
with Berkshire,

00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:09.760
he started out with
a textile mill.

00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:11.290
And it absorbed
a lot of capital.

00:06:11.290 --> 00:06:13.850
And it destroyed
value along the way.

00:06:13.850 --> 00:06:15.340
And so what you're
looking for is

00:06:15.340 --> 00:06:18.580
a business that has the
capacity for reinvestment.

00:06:18.580 --> 00:06:19.870
And you really start--

00:06:19.870 --> 00:06:23.080
it has to have a durable,
competitive edge.

00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:27.310
And for me, for some people,
that edge is technology.

00:06:27.310 --> 00:06:30.580
I guess the assembled masses
here would have a technology

00:06:30.580 --> 00:06:31.540
orientation.

00:06:31.540 --> 00:06:34.540
For me, it's consumer brands.

00:06:34.540 --> 00:06:37.810
Consumer brands have
the great benefit

00:06:37.810 --> 00:06:39.430
of having the
consumer believe there

00:06:39.430 --> 00:06:42.130
to be no adequate substitute.

00:06:42.130 --> 00:06:45.190
Once I was at a conference
in the spirits industry,

00:06:45.190 --> 00:06:48.220
and I described why it was that
I liked the spirits industry so

00:06:48.220 --> 00:06:48.720
well.

00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:53.925
And I said it was because if
somebody offered you a drink

00:06:53.925 --> 00:06:56.050
and they asked what you
wanted-- if you said a Jack

00:06:56.050 --> 00:06:57.591
Daniel's and they
came back and said,

00:06:57.591 --> 00:06:59.260
no we only have Jim Beam--

00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:01.470
the proper answer in
the world that I inhabit

00:07:01.470 --> 00:07:03.610
is, no, thank you.

00:07:03.610 --> 00:07:08.410
I would rather have water
than what is not my brand.

00:07:08.410 --> 00:07:11.985
That brand loyalty is
terrifically important.

00:07:11.985 --> 00:07:14.360
And so, if you're going to
have the capacity to reinvest,

00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:18.490
if you have a brand, and you
can invest behind expanding

00:07:18.490 --> 00:07:21.430
that brand into different
adjacent categories

00:07:21.430 --> 00:07:24.850
or geographies, it's
extremely valuable.

00:07:24.850 --> 00:07:29.860
And for me, my goal is
to find global brands.

00:07:29.860 --> 00:07:31.720
Because there you
have the ability

00:07:31.720 --> 00:07:34.420
to expand into the
parts of the world

00:07:34.420 --> 00:07:37.000
that themselves should grow.

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:40.300
If you think about the
developing and emerging

00:07:40.300 --> 00:07:43.180
markets, via
population growth, you

00:07:43.180 --> 00:07:45.070
have consumer disposable
income growth.

00:07:45.070 --> 00:07:46.079
You have GDP growth.

00:07:46.079 --> 00:07:47.620
You have the growth
of infrastructure

00:07:47.620 --> 00:07:48.860
for distribution.

00:07:48.860 --> 00:07:51.250
You have all of
that ahead of us.

00:07:51.250 --> 00:07:54.630
And that's really the
area that, for me,

00:07:54.630 --> 00:07:57.910
welcomes our investments.

00:07:57.910 --> 00:07:59.710
You also have a very
interesting factor

00:07:59.710 --> 00:08:03.510
that the brands that
I typically favor

00:08:03.510 --> 00:08:07.810
are brands that are kind
of leftover from the West

00:08:07.810 --> 00:08:11.830
during a period of time
when it was colonial.

00:08:11.830 --> 00:08:12.880
We own Nestle.

00:08:12.880 --> 00:08:13.720
We own Unilever.

00:08:13.720 --> 00:08:14.890
We own Heineken.

00:08:14.890 --> 00:08:17.230
We own Cadbury.

00:08:17.230 --> 00:08:20.590
These were products that
went around the world,

00:08:20.590 --> 00:08:22.810
but in a very thin way.

00:08:22.810 --> 00:08:25.180
They're the products
of people who

00:08:25.180 --> 00:08:28.680
lived in countries
that they controlled,

00:08:28.680 --> 00:08:30.910
but they alone could afford.

00:08:30.910 --> 00:08:39.220
Say, oh, gosh, [INAUDIBLE]
or Nescafe or Maggie Soup--

00:08:39.220 --> 00:08:42.460
those were products
that the countries

00:08:42.460 --> 00:08:47.540
in which we do a lot of
business today were present.

00:08:47.540 --> 00:08:50.900
They were advertised, but
they were very expensive.

00:08:50.900 --> 00:08:53.740
They were very inaccessible.

00:08:53.740 --> 00:08:56.260
And they were, because
of both, they've

00:08:56.260 --> 00:08:59.350
become very aspirational.

00:08:59.350 --> 00:09:04.310
And so as markets around the
world now begin to prosper--

00:09:04.310 --> 00:09:08.290
that second spouse
begins to work,

00:09:08.290 --> 00:09:11.260
they have a more
modern lifestyle--

00:09:11.260 --> 00:09:13.450
where they reach
is to the products

00:09:13.450 --> 00:09:16.360
that they once aspired
to have a chance.

00:09:16.360 --> 00:09:21.040
And we tend to, then, own
businesses that have massive

00:09:21.040 --> 00:09:24.910
amounts of free cash flow from
the mature Western markets,

00:09:24.910 --> 00:09:28.810
where it cannot be
deployed profitably.

00:09:28.810 --> 00:09:30.550
But they have the
great good fortune

00:09:30.550 --> 00:09:36.650
of unmet demand in the
developing markets.

00:09:36.650 --> 00:09:40.420
And so the organic
reinvestment is so much safer

00:09:40.420 --> 00:09:42.040
than trying to
redeploy your capital

00:09:42.040 --> 00:09:46.060
into some wholly new product
in some wholly new geography.

00:09:46.060 --> 00:09:49.690
Our job is simply to
reactivate more deeply.

00:09:49.690 --> 00:09:54.400
Now that requires--
to do it right,

00:09:54.400 --> 00:10:01.307
you need multinational and
multi-lingual management.

00:10:01.307 --> 00:10:03.390
And then multicultural, I
should say multi-lingual

00:10:03.390 --> 00:10:04.340
and multicultural.

00:10:04.340 --> 00:10:07.550
Now for example, if I
asked this audience here

00:10:07.550 --> 00:10:12.150
how many people speak
more than one language?

00:10:12.150 --> 00:10:13.870
This is Google.

00:10:13.870 --> 00:10:15.590
How many speak more than two?

00:10:15.590 --> 00:10:17.410
The hands keep going up?

00:10:17.410 --> 00:10:18.820
Over three?

00:10:18.820 --> 00:10:24.520
OK, so it's an
extraordinary capacity.

00:10:24.520 --> 00:10:30.430
At Kraft Foods, for example,
they speak 0.9 languages.

00:10:30.430 --> 00:10:35.020
In Nestle's headquarters,
the senior management

00:10:35.020 --> 00:10:36.490
speak four or five languages.

00:10:36.490 --> 00:10:39.250
And the ability for that to
help them move around the world

00:10:39.250 --> 00:10:42.100
is extremely valuable, as
you will have experienced

00:10:42.100 --> 00:10:43.680
here given your skills.

00:10:43.680 --> 00:10:45.760
Multicultural is a
little more nuanced.

00:10:45.760 --> 00:10:48.640
For example, in an audience
like this in the US,

00:10:48.640 --> 00:10:51.820
I can usually safely say,
without any answers coming back

00:10:51.820 --> 00:10:55.950
to me, who's your
favorite cricket player?

00:10:55.950 --> 00:11:00.287
I think in this audience I
must have a high percentage who

00:11:00.287 --> 00:11:01.370
could answer the question.

00:11:01.370 --> 00:11:03.430
Well, that's a big deal.

00:11:03.430 --> 00:11:05.880
You know, 1.7 billion people
will go to bed tonight

00:11:05.880 --> 00:11:09.170
thinking fond thoughts of just
one thing, which is cricket.

00:11:09.170 --> 00:11:11.560
And as an American trying
to travel the world,

00:11:11.560 --> 00:11:15.090
your effectiveness just
doesn't have the same impact

00:11:15.090 --> 00:11:19.480
if you don't have those
references and those talents.

00:11:19.480 --> 00:11:22.860
But few companies
in the world take

00:11:22.860 --> 00:11:26.910
the re-investment possibilities
and invest the right amount.

00:11:26.910 --> 00:11:29.565
And that's really
because of agency costs.

00:11:33.510 --> 00:11:37.380
The inability to
invest the right amount

00:11:37.380 --> 00:11:40.770
arises in part from the fact
that American companies,

00:11:40.770 --> 00:11:43.980
typically American companies--
that's why 70% of my assets

00:11:43.980 --> 00:11:46.470
are invested in non-US based
companies, because I think

00:11:46.470 --> 00:11:50.580
we are much more apt to
find the talent base,

00:11:50.580 --> 00:11:56.310
the historic brands in parts
of the world through companies

00:11:56.310 --> 00:11:58.950
that are headquartered in
Europe than in the US-- the US

00:11:58.950 --> 00:12:03.540
doesn't have the same
dynastic history.

00:12:03.540 --> 00:12:07.410
And they certainly
suffer from one thing,

00:12:07.410 --> 00:12:13.860
which is the vast reliance on
stock options as compensation.

00:12:13.860 --> 00:12:16.560
And stock options,
unfortunately,

00:12:16.560 --> 00:12:19.860
deliver one variable to
the investment process

00:12:19.860 --> 00:12:23.430
that shouldn't really
necessarily be a factor.

00:12:23.430 --> 00:12:25.290
And that's time.

00:12:25.290 --> 00:12:27.360
For a stock option
to reward you,

00:12:27.360 --> 00:12:30.000
it has to be worth
something on a given day.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:33.390
And so the managements
whose fortunes

00:12:33.390 --> 00:12:39.330
depend heavily on stock options
become very attuned to days.

00:12:39.330 --> 00:12:41.400
This day they'll either
be worth something,

00:12:41.400 --> 00:12:42.870
or they'll be worthless.

00:12:42.870 --> 00:12:46.200
And in the process
of making sure

00:12:46.200 --> 00:12:50.040
that the shares can be worth
as much as humanly possible

00:12:50.040 --> 00:12:54.450
at any given time, managements
of US-based companies

00:12:54.450 --> 00:12:59.075
all too often fall prey to
Wall Street, who promises them

00:12:59.075 --> 00:13:01.770
a high valuation
if they only agree

00:13:01.770 --> 00:13:04.680
to make the quarterly
earnings every quarter.

00:13:04.680 --> 00:13:07.550
I was talking to somebody
recently about this subject,

00:13:07.550 --> 00:13:09.300
about the need to show
quarterly earnings.

00:13:09.300 --> 00:13:11.580
And he raised his
hands, and said,

00:13:11.580 --> 00:13:15.060
I used to work for a Silicon
Valley-based company.

00:13:15.060 --> 00:13:18.460
I will not name it, because
I will be blackballed,

00:13:18.460 --> 00:13:20.850
but anyways, a Silicon
Valley company.

00:13:20.850 --> 00:13:24.840
And they said every
quarter, about a month

00:13:24.840 --> 00:13:28.770
left in the quarter, we'd
get the directive, which is--

00:13:28.770 --> 00:13:30.750
stop spending money.

00:13:30.750 --> 00:13:33.120
Because blank, the
head of the company,

00:13:33.120 --> 00:13:36.830
wants to make his
quarterly bonus hurdle,

00:13:36.830 --> 00:13:39.720
and we need to show profits.

00:13:39.720 --> 00:13:41.800
Now when you're in a company--

00:13:41.800 --> 00:13:44.700
I hope, I certainly expect
that not to be the case here--

00:13:44.700 --> 00:13:47.430
I don't suspect they
take away ping pong balls

00:13:47.430 --> 00:13:51.340
or bananas or cappuccinos
as you near quarter.

00:13:51.340 --> 00:13:52.900
And I hope not,
because that would

00:13:52.900 --> 00:13:56.280
show that the firm's still
vigorously on the right path.

00:13:56.280 --> 00:13:59.910
But when you find
that companies gauge

00:13:59.910 --> 00:14:04.050
their spending off
of reported income,

00:14:04.050 --> 00:14:07.170
which Wall Street suggests that
if you only make the number--

00:14:07.170 --> 00:14:08.610
and the number's
a reported income

00:14:08.610 --> 00:14:12.060
number, which is completely
fictitious, anyways--

00:14:12.060 --> 00:14:14.610
if you make that number they
will recommend your shares.

00:14:14.610 --> 00:14:16.850
The shares will be worth
more, because the multiple

00:14:16.850 --> 00:14:20.550
will apply to this
fictional number called

00:14:20.550 --> 00:14:21.810
earnings per share.

00:14:21.810 --> 00:14:24.030
And you'll have a
higher valuation.

00:14:24.030 --> 00:14:28.800
That game is extraordinarily
corrosive for businesses trying

00:14:28.800 --> 00:14:30.330
to build long term wealth.

00:14:30.330 --> 00:14:34.440
Because what you really want
to do is just the opposite.

00:14:34.440 --> 00:14:39.810
So to make the investments
that are proper,

00:14:39.810 --> 00:14:42.660
the trouble is, is that
when they start out

00:14:42.660 --> 00:14:46.380
they're extremely burdensome
on reported profits.

00:14:46.380 --> 00:14:50.310
And so what you'd need
to have are managements

00:14:50.310 --> 00:14:52.710
that have the capacity to
make the right investments

00:14:52.710 --> 00:14:56.070
for the very longest
term without fear

00:14:56.070 --> 00:15:00.030
of losing their jobs, or
without fear of takeovers.

00:15:00.030 --> 00:15:02.850
And because of that,
most public companies

00:15:02.850 --> 00:15:06.030
don't have control over
the share registry.

00:15:06.030 --> 00:15:11.070
And if they do invest
the right amount

00:15:11.070 --> 00:15:13.650
for the very longest
term, they end up

00:15:13.650 --> 00:15:15.350
at risk in the short term--

00:15:15.350 --> 00:15:18.170
the loss of their job, the
loss of corporate control.

00:15:18.170 --> 00:15:22.590
And so in our portfolios,
I was once characterized

00:15:22.590 --> 00:15:25.440
as an investor by four numbers.

00:15:25.440 --> 00:15:27.810
One of them is 70%
of our holdings

00:15:27.810 --> 00:15:32.490
are non-US, companies that are
headquartered away from the US.

00:15:32.490 --> 00:15:38.330
70% of the companies are
in the top 10 holdings.

00:15:38.330 --> 00:15:40.650
We're very
concentrated investors.

00:15:40.650 --> 00:15:44.160
The top three holdings,
on behalf of my clients,

00:15:44.160 --> 00:15:45.790
are 30% of the assets.

00:15:45.790 --> 00:15:49.110
So we're very concentrated.

00:15:49.110 --> 00:15:52.530
And 65% of our
companies are still

00:15:52.530 --> 00:15:55.730
controlled by the
founding families.

00:15:55.730 --> 00:15:58.880
And what that
means is that, when

00:15:58.880 --> 00:16:00.860
it's right to
spend, to activate,

00:16:00.860 --> 00:16:04.010
let's say Life Boy
in India, or it's

00:16:04.010 --> 00:16:06.790
right to spend to
activate more [INAUDIBLE]

00:16:06.790 --> 00:16:13.040
or more Maggie Noodle Soup,
they will spend that money.

00:16:13.040 --> 00:16:15.410
Assured that if you
build a new factory--

00:16:15.410 --> 00:16:17.090
these factories tend
to be very lumpy.

00:16:17.090 --> 00:16:20.960
In Nestle's case, for example,
it costs about $350 million

00:16:20.960 --> 00:16:25.400
to build a Maggie factory
or a powdered milk

00:16:25.400 --> 00:16:27.840
factory or a decaffeinated
coffee factory.

00:16:27.840 --> 00:16:32.030
Well, each of those are core
pillars to their business.

00:16:32.030 --> 00:16:35.120
And when they build
something like that,

00:16:35.120 --> 00:16:37.700
typically they
end up building it

00:16:37.700 --> 00:16:40.820
when the initially
installed capacity is

00:16:40.820 --> 00:16:43.042
running at over capacity.

00:16:43.042 --> 00:16:44.000
And you all understand.

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:45.458
If you're running
at over capacity,

00:16:45.458 --> 00:16:47.630
you are overstating
profitability.

00:16:47.630 --> 00:16:51.500
Because you've more than fully
absorbed the fixed costs,

00:16:51.500 --> 00:16:54.200
and you're operating
at efficiency ratios

00:16:54.200 --> 00:16:57.360
that are not sustainable
for the long term.

00:16:57.360 --> 00:17:00.200
And so ideally, if you're one
of our portfolio companies,

00:17:00.200 --> 00:17:02.780
we want you to pour
money into these markets

00:17:02.780 --> 00:17:08.130
to chase after the
initiated demand.

00:17:08.130 --> 00:17:10.839
And you have to build
a second factory.

00:17:10.839 --> 00:17:13.160
Well, the moment you
start down that path,

00:17:13.160 --> 00:17:16.800
you start to accrue
enormous amount of expenses

00:17:16.800 --> 00:17:18.540
in and around the
process of building.

00:17:18.540 --> 00:17:22.359
But the real trick is that,
very soon after it switches on,

00:17:22.359 --> 00:17:24.900
you're going to take the factory
that might have been running

00:17:24.900 --> 00:17:28.492
at 120% of capacity at
unsustainable margins,

00:17:28.492 --> 00:17:30.450
and you're going to bring
over half the volume.

00:17:30.450 --> 00:17:33.690
And both your factories are
now running at half capacity.

00:17:33.690 --> 00:17:37.240
Well, you've just blown a
hole through your margins.

00:17:37.240 --> 00:17:39.930
And it's not until
each of those factories

00:17:39.930 --> 00:17:44.180
then themselves become
fully absorbed that you're

00:17:44.180 --> 00:17:46.090
going to be back in business.

00:17:46.090 --> 00:17:48.660
However, the fact that the
reported profits dropped

00:17:48.660 --> 00:17:53.430
as they did, though
bothersome to some, for us,

00:17:53.430 --> 00:17:56.760
trained under Buffett with
the idea of the capacity

00:17:56.760 --> 00:18:03.510
to suffer through such
burdens on reported profits

00:18:03.510 --> 00:18:06.840
when developing
wealth, the wealth

00:18:06.840 --> 00:18:09.390
picks up as those businesses
come back into full absorption.

00:18:09.390 --> 00:18:10.890
And suddenly you
realize that you've

00:18:10.890 --> 00:18:13.410
met the demand you
created and you're

00:18:13.410 --> 00:18:17.490
ready to build a third factory,
let's say, or a fourth.

00:18:17.490 --> 00:18:19.500
In order to survive
to that outcome,

00:18:19.500 --> 00:18:21.540
management has to be protected.

00:18:21.540 --> 00:18:24.900
And the best way that I've
found to help protect management

00:18:24.900 --> 00:18:28.740
against those adverse outcomes
is through family control.

00:18:28.740 --> 00:18:31.140
So whether it's Brown-Forman,
which is controlled

00:18:31.140 --> 00:18:35.130
by the Brown family, whose
discipline over the years--

00:18:35.130 --> 00:18:38.160
I've owned the shares--
to roll out Jack Daniel's,

00:18:38.160 --> 00:18:42.600
their core product globally,
has richly rewarded us.

00:18:42.600 --> 00:18:45.660
Think of 1986 when
we bought the shares.

00:18:45.660 --> 00:18:49.230
They had collapsed because of
a mistake in the acquisition.

00:18:49.230 --> 00:18:52.500
And they were only left
with Jack Daniel's,

00:18:52.500 --> 00:18:55.680
which was about a four
million case brand per year,

00:18:55.680 --> 00:18:59.550
making them $300 and
some million a year.

00:18:59.550 --> 00:19:04.980
And they had a 400,000 case
Jack Daniel's business globally.

00:19:04.980 --> 00:19:08.190
The family, who had lost
a considerable amount

00:19:08.190 --> 00:19:11.400
of their fortune as a
result of mismanagement,

00:19:11.400 --> 00:19:14.610
dedicated themselves to rolling
Jack Daniel's out globally,

00:19:14.610 --> 00:19:17.580
with all the expense
that it suggested.

00:19:17.580 --> 00:19:20.700
Their earnings would
go down substantially

00:19:20.700 --> 00:19:23.670
as they took their US-based
Jack Daniel's profits

00:19:23.670 --> 00:19:27.060
and directed that
money and the expenses

00:19:27.060 --> 00:19:30.570
attached to it to developing
a taste for Jack Daniel's

00:19:30.570 --> 00:19:31.950
around the world.

00:19:31.950 --> 00:19:34.070
That was back in 1986.

00:19:34.070 --> 00:19:38.730
Today, they still do four
million cases in the US.

00:19:38.730 --> 00:19:41.610
It's gone up in profitability
because the cases today are

00:19:41.610 --> 00:19:44.580
more valuable in the
US, because consumers

00:19:44.580 --> 00:19:46.200
have returned to bourbon.

00:19:46.200 --> 00:19:48.632
And they like to have honey
or they like to have fire.

00:19:48.632 --> 00:19:50.340
They like to have all
sorts of flavoring.

00:19:50.340 --> 00:19:53.010
And they're making more
money off their US business.

00:19:53.010 --> 00:19:55.710
But the US business
did not grow.

00:19:55.710 --> 00:19:59.790
The value of the
investment in Brown-Forman

00:19:59.790 --> 00:20:03.960
arose from the fact
that the global consumer

00:20:03.960 --> 00:20:08.700
could be romanced with the
brand and the product and all

00:20:08.700 --> 00:20:11.640
the rest through heavy
investments upfront.

00:20:11.640 --> 00:20:15.910
But once the consumer
accepts the product,

00:20:15.910 --> 00:20:17.950
they develop a lifetime value.

00:20:17.950 --> 00:20:19.990
Because they'll drink
x bottles a year

00:20:19.990 --> 00:20:23.710
with x margin per person, and
you can calculate the return

00:20:23.710 --> 00:20:25.330
on that investment.

00:20:25.330 --> 00:20:29.050
You can assure yourself that
you'll have nothing but losses

00:20:29.050 --> 00:20:30.490
up front.

00:20:30.490 --> 00:20:32.714
But over time, you
absorb those losses,

00:20:32.714 --> 00:20:33.880
and you're back in business.

00:20:33.880 --> 00:20:37.930
And in the case of Jack
Daniel's the 400,000 cases

00:20:37.930 --> 00:20:43.980
in the rest of the world
today are 13 million cases.

00:20:43.980 --> 00:20:46.090
And they make about $100 a case.

00:20:46.090 --> 00:20:51.820
So they've picked up value,
earnings of about $1.3 billion.

00:20:51.820 --> 00:20:55.780
And it's really only
been permitted them

00:20:55.780 --> 00:20:59.500
because during the period of
investment, they were allowed--

00:20:59.500 --> 00:21:01.360
they had management
who ran the business,

00:21:01.360 --> 00:21:05.100
had the capacity to
suffer through censure

00:21:05.100 --> 00:21:07.990
by sell-side analysts who were
disappointed that they were

00:21:07.990 --> 00:21:09.970
no longer making the numbers.

00:21:09.970 --> 00:21:14.590
And they actually had threats
from outside activists

00:21:14.590 --> 00:21:19.030
to come in and try to dislodge
corporate control with family

00:21:19.030 --> 00:21:20.980
control, which is
existing in something

00:21:20.980 --> 00:21:23.980
like 65% of my portfolio.

00:21:23.980 --> 00:21:28.500
The families can say to those
who wish to disrupt, go away.

00:21:28.500 --> 00:21:33.030
We wish to have a
profitable dynastic future.

00:21:33.030 --> 00:21:36.310
And we don't really care about
quarterly or annual earnings.

00:21:36.310 --> 00:21:41.080
That's an extremely valuable
pond in which we fish.

00:21:41.080 --> 00:21:45.040
So the capacity
to suffer concept

00:21:45.040 --> 00:21:47.980
was sort of first delivered
to me through Berkshire.

00:21:47.980 --> 00:21:51.820
And if you take a
look, well, I think

00:21:51.820 --> 00:21:53.196
we've pretty much
gone over that.

00:21:53.196 --> 00:21:54.403
But take a look at Berkshire.

00:21:54.403 --> 00:21:57.310
There are a couple of examples
there which are so instructive.

00:21:57.310 --> 00:21:59.530
In Geico's case, they
bought Geico and only

00:21:59.530 --> 00:22:02.995
had a million policyholders.

00:22:02.995 --> 00:22:07.510
A policyholder at
Geico is worth $2,000.

00:22:07.510 --> 00:22:11.080
That's the net present value
of all of their future streams

00:22:11.080 --> 00:22:12.220
of earnings.

00:22:12.220 --> 00:22:14.860
And it's a very high
number because there's

00:22:14.860 --> 00:22:16.630
high persistency at Geico.

00:22:16.630 --> 00:22:19.240
Very few people cancel.

00:22:19.240 --> 00:22:23.614
And so if you have a client
insured, they're worth $2,000.

00:22:23.614 --> 00:22:25.030
And when they
bought the business,

00:22:25.030 --> 00:22:26.446
there were only a
million of them.

00:22:26.446 --> 00:22:29.440
So the business was worth
$2 billion, plus or minus.

00:22:29.440 --> 00:22:31.720
The trouble is when
you bring on stream

00:22:31.720 --> 00:22:34.330
a new insured, the
first year they have

00:22:34.330 --> 00:22:39.220
a loss of $250 per insured.

00:22:39.220 --> 00:22:43.240
They make $150 annually
off of an insured.

00:22:43.240 --> 00:22:47.410
But bringing one
onboard loses them $250.

00:22:47.410 --> 00:22:49.300
So if you think about
the math, when Warren

00:22:49.300 --> 00:22:52.060
bought the business, they
had a million policyholders

00:22:52.060 --> 00:22:53.230
earning $150.

00:22:53.230 --> 00:22:56.020
That's $150 million of profit.

00:22:56.020 --> 00:22:58.510
So if the next year they
wanted to grow the business

00:22:58.510 --> 00:23:01.780
by a million
policyholders, look what

00:23:01.780 --> 00:23:05.410
happens to reported profits.

00:23:05.410 --> 00:23:09.170
It goes to minus $100 million.

00:23:09.170 --> 00:23:11.890
The $150 that they
were earning suddenly

00:23:11.890 --> 00:23:14.740
gets overwhelmed
by the $250 million

00:23:14.740 --> 00:23:18.550
that attaches to the
million new insured.

00:23:18.550 --> 00:23:19.947
Now Warren bought the business.

00:23:19.947 --> 00:23:21.280
They only had a million insured.

00:23:21.280 --> 00:23:26.680
Now 14 years later, he said in
his annual report, that Geico,

00:23:26.680 --> 00:23:29.530
for all of those
who are his partners

00:23:29.530 --> 00:23:33.220
and want to understand
what it is that they own,

00:23:33.220 --> 00:23:35.890
because Warren has
said that he would

00:23:35.890 --> 00:23:40.360
like to always buy shares of
Berkshire at the right price.

00:23:40.360 --> 00:23:42.610
Berkshire would love to
repurchase its shares.

00:23:42.610 --> 00:23:47.080
The trouble is
that Warren doesn't

00:23:47.080 --> 00:23:50.290
want to buy from someone who's
uninformed about its worth.

00:23:50.290 --> 00:23:53.860
So periodically, he gives us
through the annual report gems

00:23:53.860 --> 00:23:58.090
like he did three years ago
when he said, and by the way,

00:23:58.090 --> 00:24:02.300
Geico is worth $20 billion
more than what we paid for it.

00:24:02.300 --> 00:24:06.560
And the reason was is
that, since he acquired it,

00:24:06.560 --> 00:24:10.120
at the cost of income,
he started to push hard.

00:24:10.120 --> 00:24:13.930
He took his advertising from $30
million to $900 million a year.

00:24:13.930 --> 00:24:17.290
You know that, because every
commercial on television

00:24:17.290 --> 00:24:21.700
is a caveman or a gecko
or something else.

00:24:21.700 --> 00:24:24.820
He grew the insured
base down to over $11

00:24:24.820 --> 00:24:25.930
and 1/2-- no, I'm sorry.

00:24:25.930 --> 00:24:26.440
Excuse me.

00:24:26.440 --> 00:24:29.750
It's at $13 million today.

00:24:29.750 --> 00:24:36.340
And so he's added 11 million,
12 million policyholders

00:24:36.340 --> 00:24:38.430
times $2,000 dollars per person.

00:24:38.430 --> 00:24:41.200
That's $24 billion
dollars today.

00:24:41.200 --> 00:24:43.420
What's very interesting is
this year, because there

00:24:43.420 --> 00:24:46.570
are lots of catastrophes all
over the country, weather

00:24:46.570 --> 00:24:50.660
related, Berkshire's
competitors--

00:24:50.660 --> 00:24:55.390
their dire, sort of
life battle competitors,

00:24:55.390 --> 00:24:58.510
decided not to renew
business this year

00:24:58.510 --> 00:25:00.544
and not to go
after new business.

00:25:00.544 --> 00:25:02.710
Because they were showing
losses in other businesses

00:25:02.710 --> 00:25:04.840
and they wanted
to report numbers

00:25:04.840 --> 00:25:08.050
that satisfied the sell
side who had expectations

00:25:08.050 --> 00:25:11.290
about what they should do.

00:25:11.290 --> 00:25:15.130
In the environment where the
losses elsewhere were so grave,

00:25:15.130 --> 00:25:15.910
they backed away.

00:25:15.910 --> 00:25:19.390
Warren picked up a million and
a half policyholders this year,

00:25:19.390 --> 00:25:24.220
because he has no care
whatsoever about his reported

00:25:24.220 --> 00:25:25.510
profits.

00:25:25.510 --> 00:25:28.300
Now he's fortunate, because he
controls 40% of the company.

00:25:28.300 --> 00:25:30.850
And other people friendly
to him control the rest.

00:25:30.850 --> 00:25:32.800
Nobody's going to
take over Berkshire

00:25:32.800 --> 00:25:34.900
if they under report
profits in Geico

00:25:34.900 --> 00:25:37.060
because they've
taken on the business

00:25:37.060 --> 00:25:40.540
that their competitors
forwent because they

00:25:40.540 --> 00:25:43.170
had to show numbers
differently than Berkshire.

00:25:43.170 --> 00:25:44.980
Berkshire has created
the world that it

00:25:44.980 --> 00:25:52.030
occupies by focusing only on
value and not reported profits.

00:25:52.030 --> 00:25:56.440
Anyone else could do it, but it
takes the kind of discipline.

00:25:56.440 --> 00:25:58.870
And Berkshire thrives on that.

00:25:58.870 --> 00:26:01.970
Another example-- equity
index put options--

00:26:01.970 --> 00:26:03.370
this is an interesting one.

00:26:03.370 --> 00:26:09.280
When 2000-- let's
take a look here.

00:26:09.280 --> 00:26:10.780
This is it.

00:26:10.780 --> 00:26:12.630
If you look here, it's
very hard to read.

00:26:12.630 --> 00:26:17.710
Anyways, Berkshire--
some 10, 15 years back--

00:26:17.710 --> 00:26:22.210
had the opportunity to receive
from an insurance conglomerate

00:26:22.210 --> 00:26:29.380
$5 billion of premium, with the
obligation that he would make

00:26:29.380 --> 00:26:34.720
good any decline in the value of
that portfolio from $37 billion

00:26:34.720 --> 00:26:37.150
dollars to any number below.

00:26:37.150 --> 00:26:40.720
For $5 billion in cash,
which they gave Berkshire,

00:26:40.720 --> 00:26:43.360
Berkshire pledged
to make them whole,

00:26:43.360 --> 00:26:45.830
whatever the decline took.

00:26:45.830 --> 00:26:50.860
Now nobody else
could make a pledge

00:26:50.860 --> 00:26:53.500
that the insured, the person
actually seeking insurance

00:26:53.500 --> 00:26:54.910
would actually trust.

00:26:54.910 --> 00:26:57.640
Because few would keep
enough liquidity around that,

00:26:57.640 --> 00:27:00.062
if the markets really
did melt down to zero,

00:27:00.062 --> 00:27:02.020
that they could actually
be good for the money.

00:27:02.020 --> 00:27:05.680
Well, Berkshire has $110 billion
of cash on the balance sheet

00:27:05.680 --> 00:27:09.100
and has kept a huge cash
hoard the entire time.

00:27:09.100 --> 00:27:11.810
So the insured paid
him $5 billion,

00:27:11.810 --> 00:27:14.230
which is way too much money--

00:27:14.230 --> 00:27:16.090
in part because he alone
will have the money

00:27:16.090 --> 00:27:18.850
to make good on the commitment
if it happened that the equity

00:27:18.850 --> 00:27:21.970
markets went to zero globally.

00:27:21.970 --> 00:27:25.090
He also was paid
far too much money

00:27:25.090 --> 00:27:28.960
because no other insurance
company would bid the business.

00:27:28.960 --> 00:27:34.540
Because once they've established
that they have an obligation

00:27:34.540 --> 00:27:37.620
to make whole anything
below $37 billion,

00:27:37.620 --> 00:27:39.677
they face mark to market.

00:27:39.677 --> 00:27:41.260
And what that means--
mark to market--

00:27:41.260 --> 00:27:46.780
means that if equity markets
around the world declined,

00:27:46.780 --> 00:27:50.080
he'd have to pass the amount
of his obligations increase

00:27:50.080 --> 00:27:51.710
through the income statement.

00:27:51.710 --> 00:27:54.910
And so-- I bet this has
a little red button here.

00:27:54.910 --> 00:27:56.890
I can probably
point to it anyway.

00:27:56.890 --> 00:28:00.490
If you look at
something like 2008,

00:28:00.490 --> 00:28:03.700
you'll see in one of the years
he passed through his income

00:28:03.700 --> 00:28:08.080
statement a $6 billion
quote, unquote "loss."

00:28:08.080 --> 00:28:09.520
It really isn't a loss.

00:28:09.520 --> 00:28:14.530
He had 10 or 15 years yet
before the contract matured.

00:28:14.530 --> 00:28:17.410
It was just a valuation mark.

00:28:17.410 --> 00:28:20.020
No other insurance
company, publicly held,

00:28:20.020 --> 00:28:24.010
could withstand that
type of a markdown based

00:28:24.010 --> 00:28:25.560
on mark to market.

00:28:25.560 --> 00:28:28.840
And so I think Berkshire
succeeded in that investment

00:28:28.840 --> 00:28:32.770
largely because
they did not have

00:28:32.770 --> 00:28:36.560
competitors willing to
take on the same risk.

00:28:36.560 --> 00:28:38.180
Let's go back a second here.

00:28:41.400 --> 00:28:44.430
All right.

00:28:44.430 --> 00:28:49.520
Berkshire-- OK,
let's take a look.

00:28:49.520 --> 00:28:50.210
OK.

00:28:50.210 --> 00:28:53.470
Well, we're going to move on
to the second topic, which

00:28:53.470 --> 00:28:56.150
is one of the things
I really do focus on.

00:28:56.150 --> 00:29:00.350
Obviously, the numbers-- in some
ways, the factors I most fear

00:29:00.350 --> 00:29:03.350
are businesses which
fail in the areas

00:29:03.350 --> 00:29:04.770
that I most esteem in Berkshire.

00:29:04.770 --> 00:29:07.400
And so at the start
would be agency costs.

00:29:07.400 --> 00:29:12.590
And I can assure you that
probably 90% of the investments

00:29:12.590 --> 00:29:14.810
I look at, I just pass on.

00:29:14.810 --> 00:29:18.350
Because I just don't trust that
the people who run the business

00:29:18.350 --> 00:29:20.600
will have our interests at
heart and make investments

00:29:20.600 --> 00:29:22.380
for the longest term.

00:29:22.380 --> 00:29:25.450
And one of the
examples I'd say is

00:29:25.450 --> 00:29:29.370
if a business is focused
on the near term,

00:29:29.370 --> 00:29:32.145
they'll either do
one of two things.

00:29:32.145 --> 00:29:38.720
They'll either fear
saying no to Wall Street

00:29:38.720 --> 00:29:45.510
when the right answer is yes, or
saying yes to Wall Street when

00:29:45.510 --> 00:29:47.010
the right answer is no.

00:29:47.010 --> 00:29:48.594
I'll give you an
example of this,

00:29:48.594 --> 00:29:50.760
and it is sort of an
interesting one on many levels,

00:29:50.760 --> 00:29:53.910
but it has to do with Heineken.

00:29:53.910 --> 00:29:56.460
I first bought Heineken in 1986.

00:29:56.460 --> 00:29:59.820
It was a mature Western market.

00:29:59.820 --> 00:30:01.950
25% of the profitability
of Heineken

00:30:01.950 --> 00:30:05.240
was from the United States.

00:30:05.240 --> 00:30:09.240
And they had no exposure in
developing emerging markets.

00:30:09.240 --> 00:30:12.580
Today, they have 75% of their
business in developing emerging

00:30:12.580 --> 00:30:13.080
markets.

00:30:13.080 --> 00:30:15.180
5% of the profits
comes from the US.

00:30:15.180 --> 00:30:18.500
And the two most profitable
markets are Mexico first

00:30:18.500 --> 00:30:20.500
and Vietnam second.

00:30:20.500 --> 00:30:22.890
So the business has
completely transformed itself

00:30:22.890 --> 00:30:24.810
by virtue of their
willingness to suffer

00:30:24.810 --> 00:30:28.620
through the burden on investment
along the way for the past 25

00:30:28.620 --> 00:30:30.540
years since I've held the stock.

00:30:30.540 --> 00:30:32.220
Well, a couple of
years ago, they

00:30:32.220 --> 00:30:36.581
had a chance to buy a
Brazilian brewer, which

00:30:36.581 --> 00:30:37.830
would have doubled their size.

00:30:37.830 --> 00:30:39.360
They have a 12% market share.

00:30:39.360 --> 00:30:40.950
This business had 16%.

00:30:40.950 --> 00:30:46.980
And AB InBev, Budweiser's
parent company, had the rest.

00:30:46.980 --> 00:30:50.730
Wall Street clamored for
them to buy that business.

00:30:50.730 --> 00:30:56.010
Because it would give them
extra scale in that market.

00:30:56.010 --> 00:30:57.900
Problem was the price.

00:30:57.900 --> 00:31:00.540
It was a $5 billion acquisition.

00:31:00.540 --> 00:31:03.840
Wall Street clamored on
them to say yes, do it.

00:31:03.840 --> 00:31:06.850
Heineken ran the
numbers and said, no.

00:31:06.850 --> 00:31:08.170
Walked away.

00:31:08.170 --> 00:31:13.240
Four years later, the buyer,
Kiran, came back to the market

00:31:13.240 --> 00:31:16.900
and said, not a good
business, not suitable for us.

00:31:16.900 --> 00:31:18.570
We'd like to sell it.

00:31:18.570 --> 00:31:21.060
Wall Street, having
watched it underperform

00:31:21.060 --> 00:31:24.270
for that period of time,
said absolutely don't even

00:31:24.270 --> 00:31:25.500
go close to it.

00:31:25.500 --> 00:31:28.260
No, don't even think about
buying that business.

00:31:28.260 --> 00:31:29.690
Heineken took a look at.

00:31:29.690 --> 00:31:31.590
Thought-- looked
pretty interesting.

00:31:31.590 --> 00:31:34.920
They bought it for
$720 million dollars.

00:31:34.920 --> 00:31:37.980
Now you can make a lot
of money buying something

00:31:37.980 --> 00:31:41.280
for $720 instead of $5 billion.

00:31:41.280 --> 00:31:47.710
And Wall Street-- and
Heineken is 51% controlled

00:31:47.710 --> 00:31:50.430
in shareholdings by the family.

00:31:50.430 --> 00:31:54.540
So when first pressured
to buy it for $5 billion,

00:31:54.540 --> 00:31:55.840
the family said no.

00:31:55.840 --> 00:31:56.460
It's stupid.

00:31:56.460 --> 00:31:57.930
Doesn't make any sense.

00:31:57.930 --> 00:32:01.720
At $720, when they were
threatened if they bought it,

00:32:01.720 --> 00:32:04.290
they'd be downgraded
by every analyst--

00:32:04.290 --> 00:32:05.360
who cares?

00:32:05.360 --> 00:32:10.470
It's $720 million for 18--
it was 16% of the market.

00:32:10.470 --> 00:32:15.420
The real trick was that,
having bought it at $720,

00:32:15.420 --> 00:32:18.120
they now recognize they
have a billion dollars that

00:32:18.120 --> 00:32:20.490
will be passed through the
income statement putting it

00:32:20.490 --> 00:32:21.540
together.

00:32:21.540 --> 00:32:23.640
They have to move factories
and breweries around.

00:32:23.640 --> 00:32:25.641
They have to redo their
distribution agreements.

00:32:25.641 --> 00:32:28.056
They're going to be spending
a tremendous amount of money,

00:32:28.056 --> 00:32:30.150
and that's going to burden
the income statement

00:32:30.150 --> 00:32:32.370
for the foreseeable future.

00:32:32.370 --> 00:32:35.340
And that burden is what
Wall Street really hates.

00:32:35.340 --> 00:32:39.790
And that's why they recommended
around the news of this event

00:32:39.790 --> 00:32:42.620
that they've gone mad.

00:32:42.620 --> 00:32:44.580
They're entering
in the market that

00:32:44.580 --> 00:32:47.640
cost somebody else $3
billion, $4 billion.

00:32:47.640 --> 00:32:50.010
And the share price weakened.

00:32:50.010 --> 00:32:52.010
Along came another
company called

00:32:52.010 --> 00:32:55.910
SAB Miller, South African
Breweries Miller Beer.

00:32:55.910 --> 00:32:59.000
And they were being
pursued by Budweiser.

00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:00.750
And of course, what
do they do, well, they

00:33:00.750 --> 00:33:04.380
lob a takeover offer
to buy Heineken.

00:33:04.380 --> 00:33:05.490
The shares had gone down.

00:33:05.490 --> 00:33:10.069
And the market was disappointed
they bought the Brazilians.

00:33:10.069 --> 00:33:11.610
They sent a letter
to Heineken saying

00:33:11.610 --> 00:33:13.870
we'd like to take you over
for a very high price.

00:33:13.870 --> 00:33:16.520
Heineken said no,
thanks, goodbye.

00:33:16.520 --> 00:33:19.380
They have 50.1
percent of the vote,

00:33:19.380 --> 00:33:22.420
and they don't have to worry
about Wall Street's pressure.

00:33:22.420 --> 00:33:24.540
Now in this context,
they've already

00:33:24.540 --> 00:33:26.340
become as profitable
and as large

00:33:26.340 --> 00:33:27.960
as they have because
of their capacity

00:33:27.960 --> 00:33:30.630
to suffer through the upfront
cost of their investments.

00:33:30.630 --> 00:33:34.530
But this episode, they said no
when Wall Street clamored yes.

00:33:34.530 --> 00:33:36.540
They said yes when
Wall Street said no.

00:33:36.540 --> 00:33:38.940
And then as a result of
that, the bad reception

00:33:38.940 --> 00:33:40.200
when the shares went down.

00:33:40.200 --> 00:33:42.510
They were offered a take
over to which they said no.

00:33:42.510 --> 00:33:44.460
And we will continue
to hold the shares.

00:33:44.460 --> 00:33:46.830
I've held them since 1986.

00:33:46.830 --> 00:33:51.370
And I think that's a pretty
good example of how that works.

00:33:51.370 --> 00:33:56.160
So let's jump on
to the section that

00:33:56.160 --> 00:33:58.710
is what I most worry about.

00:33:58.710 --> 00:34:02.070
Here we go--
factors I most fear.

00:34:02.070 --> 00:34:08.725
The first one is the first and
only, really, is agency costs.

00:34:08.725 --> 00:34:10.625
Huh.

00:34:10.625 --> 00:34:12.230
Have we lost it?

00:34:12.230 --> 00:34:13.280
Yeah, there it is.

00:34:13.280 --> 00:34:15.900
And you know the
list is enormous,

00:34:15.900 --> 00:34:17.969
the businesses that I've
owned that have suffered

00:34:17.969 --> 00:34:21.510
and we've actually sold them
because of agency costs.

00:34:21.510 --> 00:34:24.920
Citibank, at one
point, had a business

00:34:24.920 --> 00:34:30.409
whereby they would underwrite
bonds even if the market had

00:34:30.409 --> 00:34:31.969
no interest in them.

00:34:31.969 --> 00:34:38.179
And they'd put them in something
called the side pocket, SIV.

00:34:38.179 --> 00:34:42.739
And in a sense, the
bankers were issuing debt

00:34:42.739 --> 00:34:47.270
on behalf of businesses
which had no buyers.

00:34:47.270 --> 00:34:51.889
And so they created a vehicle
alongside the balance sheet

00:34:51.889 --> 00:34:57.950
of Citibank in which they
would park these unsold bonds.

00:34:57.950 --> 00:34:59.570
At the end of the
year, the management

00:34:59.570 --> 00:35:02.960
would get their bonuses for
having produced the bonds.

00:35:02.960 --> 00:35:04.820
And at some point,
off balance sheet,

00:35:04.820 --> 00:35:08.590
they sat festering
and the burden,

00:35:08.590 --> 00:35:10.540
ultimately, on Citibank.

00:35:10.540 --> 00:35:14.110
And when I was described
that condition,

00:35:14.110 --> 00:35:17.050
I sold the shares immediately.

00:35:17.050 --> 00:35:21.180
Citibank turned out to be a
complete disaster thereafter.

00:35:21.180 --> 00:35:26.210
It dropped by 98% since
we sold those shares.

00:35:26.210 --> 00:35:29.260
And it was a complete disaster,
but for one thing for us

00:35:29.260 --> 00:35:31.120
personally-- is
that through it we

00:35:31.120 --> 00:35:38.230
met a man named Ajay Banga,
who's the CEO of MasterCard.

00:35:38.230 --> 00:35:43.610
And we bought MasterCard soon
thereafter for $20 a share.

00:35:43.610 --> 00:35:45.610
It's now $170.

00:35:45.610 --> 00:35:48.670
It's been the best investment
that we've probably made.

00:35:48.670 --> 00:35:50.560
And the investment
really was based

00:35:50.560 --> 00:35:54.360
on the character and caliber
of this business leader, who

00:35:54.360 --> 00:35:57.190
was exceptional and unrivaled.

00:35:57.190 --> 00:36:01.300
We did not buy MasterCard
at the first iteration.

00:36:01.300 --> 00:36:04.390
But it was a tremendous
dividend that

00:36:04.390 --> 00:36:08.110
came as a result of
our activities there.

00:36:08.110 --> 00:36:10.930
International Speedway is
a business that we owned.

00:36:10.930 --> 00:36:14.470
And a family, called
the France family,

00:36:14.470 --> 00:36:16.660
owned the NASCAR franchise.

00:36:16.660 --> 00:36:19.300
And international Speedway
was a public vehicle

00:36:19.300 --> 00:36:20.960
which owned tracks.

00:36:20.960 --> 00:36:26.320
And just like Coca-Cola has
a conflict with its bottlers,

00:36:26.320 --> 00:36:30.040
to have the bottlers spend
more money so Coke the brand

00:36:30.040 --> 00:36:32.680
could become more
valuable, in this case,

00:36:32.680 --> 00:36:35.830
International Speedway
embarked upon a shareholder

00:36:35.830 --> 00:36:40.480
driven mandate to build more
tracks around the country.

00:36:40.480 --> 00:36:42.160
NASCAR is a great business.

00:36:42.160 --> 00:36:45.730
You know, it's basically
a branding opportunity

00:36:45.730 --> 00:36:49.480
for companies that want
to reach middle America,

00:36:49.480 --> 00:36:55.070
and it was regionally
defined historically.

00:36:55.070 --> 00:36:58.090
And they went on a
hunt for new locations.

00:36:58.090 --> 00:37:00.220
And they built
seven more places.

00:37:00.220 --> 00:37:02.320
Ultimately, they
threatened the franchise

00:37:02.320 --> 00:37:04.150
because of oversaturation.

00:37:04.150 --> 00:37:06.100
And at the end of
it all, they were

00:37:06.100 --> 00:37:12.400
trying to build for $500
million a racetrack in Staten

00:37:12.400 --> 00:37:15.130
Island over a waste dump.

00:37:15.130 --> 00:37:18.520
And of course, a completely
ridiculous extension

00:37:18.520 --> 00:37:21.370
at that point, benefiting
the family because they

00:37:21.370 --> 00:37:24.220
get more revenue
because of more sites.

00:37:24.220 --> 00:37:28.660
But destroying value all along
at the company International

00:37:28.660 --> 00:37:29.920
Speedway.

00:37:29.920 --> 00:37:31.660
That was a misalignment
of interests,

00:37:31.660 --> 00:37:33.280
and you can see those.

00:37:33.280 --> 00:37:36.430
Second thing I fear the most is
lack of natural reinvestment.

00:37:36.430 --> 00:37:38.650
As I said, the
businesses that we own

00:37:38.650 --> 00:37:40.212
have a very natural
reinvestment,

00:37:40.212 --> 00:37:41.920
which is they just go
back to the markets

00:37:41.920 --> 00:37:44.560
where they've
longstandedly existed,

00:37:44.560 --> 00:37:47.320
and invest to build
distribution, marketing brand

00:37:47.320 --> 00:37:50.110
awareness, and all the rest.

00:37:50.110 --> 00:37:51.760
So we own Wells Fargo.

00:37:51.760 --> 00:37:53.890
It's a domestic business.

00:37:53.890 --> 00:37:57.310
At some point, we will sell it,
because it doesn't really have

00:37:57.310 --> 00:37:59.410
the reinvestment opportunities.

00:37:59.410 --> 00:38:02.140
We call that
opportunity white space.

00:38:02.140 --> 00:38:04.730
And to give you an
order of magnitude,

00:38:04.730 --> 00:38:08.215
we own several
brewers in Africa.

00:38:10.780 --> 00:38:14.000
There's 400 million barrels
of beer consumed a year.

00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:16.900
And the businesses that
we collectively own only

00:38:16.900 --> 00:38:20.260
manufacture 100 million
of those barrels.

00:38:20.260 --> 00:38:22.660
There's 300 million
barrels that are

00:38:22.660 --> 00:38:26.615
available as a natural
opportunity to reinvest.

00:38:29.710 --> 00:38:31.780
What I fear most is
the understanding

00:38:31.780 --> 00:38:35.500
that some companies don't
know what is enough.

00:38:35.500 --> 00:38:37.850
Berkshire's excellent at that.

00:38:37.850 --> 00:38:41.080
And it made us a
tremendous amount

00:38:41.080 --> 00:38:45.460
of money knowing that a certain
investment is very, very

00:38:45.460 --> 00:38:47.860
valuable, and not to
reach for something

00:38:47.860 --> 00:38:53.240
that's beyond the
realization potential.

00:38:53.240 --> 00:38:55.780
So for example, in the one I'm
thinking of with Berkshire,

00:38:55.780 --> 00:38:57.280
understanding what is enough--

00:38:57.280 --> 00:39:00.670
in the midst of the
financial crisis of 2010,

00:39:00.670 --> 00:39:05.290
they issued a $6
billion preferred to--

00:39:05.290 --> 00:39:08.630
or they bought $6.2 billion
preferred from Bank of America.

00:39:08.630 --> 00:39:10.310
This is 6%.

00:39:10.310 --> 00:39:13.230
They were only making half
a percent on their cash, so

00:39:13.230 --> 00:39:14.860
a big improvement off the cash.

00:39:14.860 --> 00:39:17.740
But really, what they
got from it was--

00:39:17.740 --> 00:39:19.870
in return for their
goodwill that's

00:39:19.870 --> 00:39:23.680
conferred upon them by
virtue of their credit

00:39:23.680 --> 00:39:26.150
review of Bank of America--
was valuable enough

00:39:26.150 --> 00:39:30.610
that Bank of America gave
Berkshire 700 million

00:39:30.610 --> 00:39:34.390
call options at $7 a share,
which was the then market

00:39:34.390 --> 00:39:37.240
price that lasted for 10 years.

00:39:37.240 --> 00:39:42.640
That has made
Berkshire $22 billion.

00:39:42.640 --> 00:39:47.800
So a modest looking preferred
6%, beneficial for them

00:39:47.800 --> 00:39:52.360
because there's a tax shield
by dividends, but still modest.

00:39:52.360 --> 00:39:56.530
With that warrant attached,
turns $6 billion dollars

00:39:56.530 --> 00:39:58.030
into $28.

00:39:58.030 --> 00:39:59.000
It's extraordinary.

00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:03.290
Now you know, other people at
the same time reach for yield.

00:40:03.290 --> 00:40:06.070
But if you reach for
yield, and it's too high,

00:40:06.070 --> 00:40:09.930
chances are you'll get what
the yield suggests, which

00:40:09.930 --> 00:40:12.720
is more risk than you care for.

00:40:12.720 --> 00:40:17.490
Anyway, so by far and away,
the next factor I fear

00:40:17.490 --> 00:40:18.960
is corruption.

00:40:18.960 --> 00:40:20.820
And I'll give you a
couple of fun examples.

00:40:20.820 --> 00:40:22.360
In response.

00:40:22.360 --> 00:40:25.380
Most of Richemont's competitors,
luxury goods company,

00:40:25.380 --> 00:40:27.720
most of their
competitors in Russia

00:40:27.720 --> 00:40:30.150
did business with a facilitator.

00:40:30.150 --> 00:40:34.230
And the facilitator was
really the Chechnyan mob.

00:40:34.230 --> 00:40:36.180
And the way that
works is, you know,

00:40:36.180 --> 00:40:38.010
they'll get you into
anything upfront.

00:40:38.010 --> 00:40:39.510
But then they're
your silent partner

00:40:39.510 --> 00:40:40.593
for the rest of your time.

00:40:40.593 --> 00:40:42.420
And Richemont has
enough money that they

00:40:42.420 --> 00:40:43.996
don't need a silent partner.

00:40:43.996 --> 00:40:45.120
They were shown a building.

00:40:45.120 --> 00:40:48.240
There's a twin building
on the main boulevard

00:40:48.240 --> 00:40:50.320
for shopping for luxury.

00:40:50.320 --> 00:40:51.720
And they were
shown one that they

00:40:51.720 --> 00:40:57.230
could move into immediately
for $500,000 a year rent.

00:40:57.230 --> 00:40:59.630
The next door was
the same building,

00:40:59.630 --> 00:41:01.850
kind of in poor repair.

00:41:01.850 --> 00:41:05.510
The one that they could go
into was fully repaired.

00:41:05.510 --> 00:41:12.530
The next door one they bought
for $25 million dollars.

00:41:12.530 --> 00:41:14.780
Instead of taking a
half a million a year

00:41:14.780 --> 00:41:17.414
lease for the whole building,
they paid $25 million

00:41:17.414 --> 00:41:18.830
for the building
that they bought.

00:41:18.830 --> 00:41:20.270
They wanted independence.

00:41:20.270 --> 00:41:22.400
And it had an upfront cost.

00:41:22.400 --> 00:41:25.190
They did nothing but lose money.

00:41:25.190 --> 00:41:27.860
But over time, they
owned their future.

00:41:27.860 --> 00:41:29.810
The people who take
the early bait,

00:41:29.810 --> 00:41:33.410
come in to get active
quickly in that market,

00:41:33.410 --> 00:41:35.199
rue the fact that they
ever met the group.

00:41:35.199 --> 00:41:36.740
Because for the rest
of time, they'll

00:41:36.740 --> 00:41:38.530
take more and more
and more money.

00:41:38.530 --> 00:41:40.760
It's the mob.

00:41:40.760 --> 00:41:44.504
And Richemont not caring
about near term income,

00:41:44.504 --> 00:41:46.420
because it's controlled
by the Rupert family--

00:41:46.420 --> 00:41:49.340
they want wealth, not
reported profits--

00:41:49.340 --> 00:41:51.230
paid way over the top.

00:41:51.230 --> 00:41:52.850
But they bought certainty.

00:41:52.850 --> 00:41:56.750
I visited Heineken
in St. Petersburg.

00:41:56.750 --> 00:41:59.330
And they had a factory that--

00:41:59.330 --> 00:42:06.860
this corruption-- that they
had to hire a local mob

00:42:06.860 --> 00:42:09.570
"for security", quote, unquote.

00:42:09.570 --> 00:42:13.340
Because it's very hard
under IFRS to stash bribes

00:42:13.340 --> 00:42:14.810
in an income statement.

00:42:14.810 --> 00:42:16.850
So you figure out
something like security.

00:42:16.850 --> 00:42:21.009
So they had hired this group
to deliver 50 people walking

00:42:21.009 --> 00:42:23.300
around with machine guns in
this warehouse full of beer

00:42:23.300 --> 00:42:25.250
that they just brewed.

00:42:25.250 --> 00:42:27.140
And then they all
wore brown shirts.

00:42:27.140 --> 00:42:29.090
And inside, there were a group
of people with machine guns

00:42:29.090 --> 00:42:29.965
who had white shirts.

00:42:29.965 --> 00:42:33.390
I said, why are the white shirt
people with machine guns--

00:42:33.390 --> 00:42:35.300
well, those are
the people we hire

00:42:35.300 --> 00:42:39.620
to protect against the
mob who we have to pay.

00:42:39.620 --> 00:42:41.720
This is a difficult
way to do business.

00:42:41.720 --> 00:42:43.670
And unfortunately,
it's all too common.

00:42:43.670 --> 00:42:45.420
We still hold
Heineken, despite that.

00:42:45.420 --> 00:42:49.430
But it gives you a sense of
what we're attuned to at least.

00:42:49.430 --> 00:42:51.680
Agency costs, you
know the story there.

00:42:51.680 --> 00:42:54.710
Excise tax-- that's
very interesting.

00:42:54.710 --> 00:42:59.787
Our businesses have a
price in elastic demand.

00:42:59.787 --> 00:43:01.370
That means that
governments understand

00:43:01.370 --> 00:43:03.245
that they can raise the
price on our products

00:43:03.245 --> 00:43:05.270
and the consumers
will keep consuming.

00:43:05.270 --> 00:43:10.610
Whether it's cigarettes, beer,
or spirits, that's the case.

00:43:10.610 --> 00:43:12.050
However, around
the world there's

00:43:12.050 --> 00:43:14.510
a new product, which is
this thing here which

00:43:14.510 --> 00:43:15.710
Philip Morris has invented.

00:43:15.710 --> 00:43:20.795
Which is a heat not burned
cigarette replacement.

00:43:20.795 --> 00:43:22.670
They developed this over
the past four years.

00:43:22.670 --> 00:43:25.880
They spent $2.5 billion
dollars developing this,

00:43:25.880 --> 00:43:28.460
destroying their reported
profits for 2 and 1/2 years.

00:43:28.460 --> 00:43:30.140
But they realized
that if they didn't

00:43:30.140 --> 00:43:32.120
transition from
traditional cigarettes

00:43:32.120 --> 00:43:34.370
to the next generation,
someone else would.

00:43:34.370 --> 00:43:37.400
And so they invested to destroy
their own business ultimately,

00:43:37.400 --> 00:43:40.010
and came up with this thing.

00:43:40.010 --> 00:43:42.740
Since they've launched
it, five million Japanese

00:43:42.740 --> 00:43:45.360
have converted fully
to this product

00:43:45.360 --> 00:43:47.810
and they've given up
combusted cigarettes.

00:43:47.810 --> 00:43:51.420
So it's a very big deal.

00:43:51.420 --> 00:43:54.440
And when they launch
throughout the world,

00:43:54.440 --> 00:43:57.940
they're given a big
discount in excise taxes.

00:43:57.940 --> 00:44:00.590
And that excise tax
discount is what

00:44:00.590 --> 00:44:03.140
helps underwrite the cost
of developing this product

00:44:03.140 --> 00:44:05.540
and sending it worldwide.

00:44:05.540 --> 00:44:12.170
So taxes are usually
confiscatory and drive away

00:44:12.170 --> 00:44:14.810
pricing pop elasticity.

00:44:14.810 --> 00:44:17.360
But in some instances,
they'll adopt something

00:44:17.360 --> 00:44:22.470
like this product with an idea
towards helping the society.

00:44:22.470 --> 00:44:25.580
So we just go on, regulation--

00:44:25.580 --> 00:44:27.660
you know, you see it
all over the world.

00:44:27.660 --> 00:44:33.470
In India, you cannot
import spirits.

00:44:33.470 --> 00:44:40.910
If there's one thing that in
India is a bankable outcome,

00:44:40.910 --> 00:44:47.180
it is their passion for scotch
whisky as a broad statement.

00:44:47.180 --> 00:44:49.520
And let me ask
here, of any Indians

00:44:49.520 --> 00:44:53.510
here, what is it
that would be most

00:44:53.510 --> 00:44:58.070
likely to travel home through
duty free with an Indian?

00:44:58.070 --> 00:44:59.130
It's one thing.

00:44:59.130 --> 00:45:01.280
You all have the same idea?

00:45:01.280 --> 00:45:04.400
It's Johnny Walker
Black Label two bottles.

00:45:04.400 --> 00:45:05.340
It's Black Label.

00:45:05.340 --> 00:45:07.270
That's just it.

00:45:07.270 --> 00:45:15.430
The Indians drink 125 million
cases of scotch-like products.

00:45:15.430 --> 00:45:18.880
But the tariff barriers are so
horrific that you can't really

00:45:18.880 --> 00:45:19.960
bring in scotch.

00:45:19.960 --> 00:45:23.350
That's why it's a
duty free thing.

00:45:23.350 --> 00:45:26.950
Scotland produces 75
million barrels a year.

00:45:26.950 --> 00:45:28.910
And we own three--

00:45:28.910 --> 00:45:30.790
we own four Scotch producers.

00:45:30.790 --> 00:45:35.230
And we believe that over time
that regulation, because of WTO

00:45:35.230 --> 00:45:38.350
and all of the other
forces that open up

00:45:38.350 --> 00:45:42.940
markets that want to themselves
be open to trade elsewhere,

00:45:42.940 --> 00:45:47.440
that we will see a world where
Indians will get really what

00:45:47.440 --> 00:45:51.940
they prefer, which is a high
quality imported heritage

00:45:51.940 --> 00:45:52.690
beverage.

00:45:52.690 --> 00:45:56.410
And the target market--
there's 125 million cases.

00:45:56.410 --> 00:46:00.220
And so regulation
prevents it now.

00:46:00.220 --> 00:46:03.830
In India, we own shares
of United Brewery.

00:46:03.830 --> 00:46:07.000
We own 50% of United
Brewery through Heineken.

00:46:07.000 --> 00:46:10.150
It's very hard to get
economics right for breweries,

00:46:10.150 --> 00:46:13.090
because you have to have a
brewery in each province.

00:46:13.090 --> 00:46:15.460
And obviously, breweries scale
at a much different level

00:46:15.460 --> 00:46:17.320
than the provincial demand.

00:46:17.320 --> 00:46:21.520
And there are only 13,000 legal
outlets for beer in India.

00:46:21.520 --> 00:46:25.100
It's 1.4 billion people.

00:46:25.100 --> 00:46:30.940
And so all of those forces
that relate to regulation

00:46:30.940 --> 00:46:33.400
will, over time,
open up, and I think

00:46:33.400 --> 00:46:36.760
lead to our business's success.

00:46:36.760 --> 00:46:39.660
We talked about taxation.

00:46:39.660 --> 00:46:42.960
We have-- oh, it's very
funny, with different culture

00:46:42.960 --> 00:46:44.350
references.

00:46:44.350 --> 00:46:48.780
A Chinese company came
about, maybe eight years ago,

00:46:48.780 --> 00:46:54.030
created by two people who had
studied and trained in the US.

00:46:54.030 --> 00:46:54.750
I met with them.

00:46:54.750 --> 00:46:59.970
They sold leaf and paper
for the cigarette industry.

00:46:59.970 --> 00:47:01.080
They went public.

00:47:01.080 --> 00:47:01.980
I met with them.

00:47:01.980 --> 00:47:03.534
They spoke perfect English.

00:47:03.534 --> 00:47:05.700
They knew everything about
accounting, all the rest.

00:47:05.700 --> 00:47:07.200
And I thought, gosh,
that's amazing.

00:47:07.200 --> 00:47:10.350
Because for 25 years, I've
met with the management,

00:47:10.350 --> 00:47:13.920
senior management
of Japan Tobacco,

00:47:13.920 --> 00:47:18.130
third largest tobacco
company in the world.

00:47:18.130 --> 00:47:21.760
We still talk to them
through interpreters.

00:47:21.760 --> 00:47:23.790
25 years later, they still--

00:47:23.790 --> 00:47:26.230
there's a fiction
of interpreters.

00:47:26.230 --> 00:47:30.010
You know, and it really makes
a big difference in terms

00:47:30.010 --> 00:47:31.540
of your ability to understand.

00:47:31.540 --> 00:47:36.100
I visited Korea and met with a
man from Latte Confectionery,

00:47:36.100 --> 00:47:38.350
to give you an example of
how cultural differences can

00:47:38.350 --> 00:47:39.460
play against you.

00:47:39.460 --> 00:47:43.060
I asked the interpreter to
ask the CFO who we're with,

00:47:43.060 --> 00:47:46.630
what the future cash flow looked
like for the next and coming

00:47:46.630 --> 00:47:47.410
years.

00:47:47.410 --> 00:47:52.600
And they spoke Korean
together for about 40 minutes.

00:47:52.600 --> 00:47:56.110
And the answer came back better.

00:47:56.110 --> 00:47:58.160
The answer came back,
you know, better.

00:47:58.160 --> 00:47:59.050
OK.

00:47:59.050 --> 00:48:01.000
I can't invest on that.

00:48:01.000 --> 00:48:03.770
And the last example, and
again, it's just a story.

00:48:03.770 --> 00:48:06.400
But it's true and fun.

00:48:06.400 --> 00:48:08.710
I went to see Asahi Beer.

00:48:08.710 --> 00:48:11.930
And I spoke through an
interpreter for four hours just

00:48:11.930 --> 00:48:12.430
like that.

00:48:12.430 --> 00:48:16.270
And complete-- same kind
of conclusionary answers

00:48:16.270 --> 00:48:16.780
came back.

00:48:16.780 --> 00:48:19.060
And we finished a
miserable experience.

00:48:19.060 --> 00:48:21.520
And afterwards, we
swapped business cards.

00:48:21.520 --> 00:48:23.950
And the man who
received the card said,

00:48:23.950 --> 00:48:26.890
oh, you're from Lancaster.

00:48:26.890 --> 00:48:28.960
I grew up in Reading.

00:48:28.960 --> 00:48:29.950
Now he's in Japan.

00:48:29.950 --> 00:48:32.260
And he's the Director
of Investor Relations

00:48:32.260 --> 00:48:35.150
for Asahi Beer, Japanese beer.

00:48:35.150 --> 00:48:37.630
But he spent eight
years of his life

00:48:37.630 --> 00:48:41.020
as a teenager living 20 minutes
from where our offices are

00:48:41.020 --> 00:48:42.780
in Pennsylvania.

00:48:42.780 --> 00:48:46.220
And he spent four hours
of my life torturing me

00:48:46.220 --> 00:48:50.970
with a translator, only
to finish up by saying,

00:48:50.970 --> 00:48:52.640
oh, I grew up in Lancaster.

00:48:52.640 --> 00:48:53.770
You're in Reading.

00:48:53.770 --> 00:48:58.450
And so that's something that I
fear the most is the inability

00:48:58.450 --> 00:49:00.520
to get information.

00:49:00.520 --> 00:49:02.990
And then a quick look
at some mistakes.

00:49:02.990 --> 00:49:07.130
Newspapers-- I lost a lot
of money on newspapers.

00:49:07.130 --> 00:49:13.060
They just completely
missed you guys.

00:49:13.060 --> 00:49:17.210
Newspapers co-opted radio
when it first came about.

00:49:17.210 --> 00:49:19.300
They co-opted
television stations.

00:49:19.300 --> 00:49:21.790
They understood that they
needed to buy up cable business.

00:49:21.790 --> 00:49:24.940
They did everything related
to media and entertainment

00:49:24.940 --> 00:49:28.990
and advertising to keep
the power and the franchise

00:49:28.990 --> 00:49:30.760
within their own industry.

00:49:30.760 --> 00:49:35.579
And along came eBay
and Amazon, early days.

00:49:35.579 --> 00:49:37.120
And they went straight
to newspapers,

00:49:37.120 --> 00:49:37.950
and said, let's partner.

00:49:37.950 --> 00:49:38.866
You've got the market.

00:49:38.866 --> 00:49:42.610
We've got the next gen. Let's
do it together, perfect.

00:49:42.610 --> 00:49:45.220
And the newspapers have
become so monopolistic

00:49:45.220 --> 00:49:48.880
fat and lethargic and slothful
that they said, no, we

00:49:48.880 --> 00:49:50.470
want to keep it ourselves.

00:49:50.470 --> 00:49:53.110
But they just
blinked in this case.

00:49:53.110 --> 00:49:55.150
And we sold all
of our newspapers.

00:49:55.150 --> 00:49:59.007
And it was a disappointment.

00:49:59.007 --> 00:50:00.340
These are mistakes of comission.

00:50:00.340 --> 00:50:02.350
I actually own those.

00:50:02.350 --> 00:50:05.230
And mistakes of omission
are interesting.

00:50:05.230 --> 00:50:08.380
Mastercard, at the
IPO we did not buy it.

00:50:08.380 --> 00:50:10.110
They lacked a dynamic leader.

00:50:10.110 --> 00:50:12.090
Ajay Banga came along later on.

00:50:12.090 --> 00:50:14.410
It went up fivefold
after the IPO.

00:50:14.410 --> 00:50:15.380
We did not own it.

00:50:15.380 --> 00:50:18.884
Then it dropped 80% back to
something close to the start.

00:50:18.884 --> 00:50:20.550
And we bought it the
second time around.

00:50:20.550 --> 00:50:23.005
But only because of
the quality of the CEO

00:50:23.005 --> 00:50:28.060
who came in, who's one of
the most masterful leaders

00:50:28.060 --> 00:50:28.750
in business now.

00:50:28.750 --> 00:50:29.380
He's Indian.

00:50:29.380 --> 00:50:33.340
He started-- excelled
at the finest school

00:50:33.340 --> 00:50:35.890
and is extraordinarily talented.

00:50:35.890 --> 00:50:39.040
I omitted to buy Moutai.

00:50:39.040 --> 00:50:42.580
I saw someone--
are you from China?

00:50:42.580 --> 00:50:44.500
China-- so Moutai.

00:50:44.500 --> 00:50:47.080
The shares collapsed
five years ago

00:50:47.080 --> 00:50:51.430
and when Xi went after
banqueting and luxury

00:50:51.430 --> 00:50:54.550
in his attempt to get
rid of corruption.

00:50:54.550 --> 00:50:58.150
The shares collapsed and
have advanced eight-fold

00:50:58.150 --> 00:51:00.130
over the past four years.

00:51:00.130 --> 00:51:03.880
And the market value of
Moutai might be $400 billion.

00:51:03.880 --> 00:51:08.320
They make 70-- and what's the
number they make $7 billion

00:51:08.320 --> 00:51:10.150
or some number that
is just unfathomable.

00:51:10.150 --> 00:51:12.100
But it's a brand
that I didn't buy,

00:51:12.100 --> 00:51:15.550
because I assumed at some
point that as China became

00:51:15.550 --> 00:51:18.694
a more open nation with
more people traveling

00:51:18.694 --> 00:51:20.110
around the world
they would surely

00:51:20.110 --> 00:51:24.430
leave that product, which no
one can drink outside of China,

00:51:24.430 --> 00:51:27.160
and aspire to the things that
the rest of the world like.

00:51:27.160 --> 00:51:28.618
And it hasn't
happened, and they've

00:51:28.618 --> 00:51:31.000
made an extraordinary fortune.

00:51:31.000 --> 00:51:33.910
And the other thing is it was
controlled by the Communist

00:51:33.910 --> 00:51:35.140
Party and the army.

00:51:35.140 --> 00:51:37.870
And I just felt like that
would be a fairly high level

00:51:37.870 --> 00:51:39.250
of agency cost.

00:51:39.250 --> 00:51:41.930
I passed Alibaba at
the IPO agency cost.

00:51:41.930 --> 00:51:43.900
I mean, what could
be more strong

00:51:43.900 --> 00:51:47.990
than to know that Alibaba's
Jack Ma already took $6 billion

00:51:47.990 --> 00:51:52.870
illicitly from Yahoo
through AliPay?

00:51:52.870 --> 00:51:56.200
So that seemed like it was
probably a strike against them.

00:51:56.200 --> 00:51:57.430
But it's done extremely well.

00:51:57.430 --> 00:52:02.150
And Google-- I haven't purchased
their shares, even though I

00:52:02.150 --> 00:52:04.570
am extraordinarily
impressed with their ability

00:52:04.570 --> 00:52:09.260
to recruit the best and the
brightest, you included.

00:52:09.260 --> 00:52:15.370
And the notion of
allowing those here

00:52:15.370 --> 00:52:19.480
to share and participate
in developing products

00:52:19.480 --> 00:52:22.180
without a lot of ownership
amongst age groups

00:52:22.180 --> 00:52:25.070
or divisions-- so it's
an extraordinary company.

00:52:25.070 --> 00:52:26.350
I take my hat off to you.

00:52:26.350 --> 00:52:28.540
I should have bought the
shares a long time ago.

00:52:28.540 --> 00:52:30.160
But I'll say open
minded on them.

00:52:32.820 --> 00:52:36.940
You know, I think I'm going
to call that-- oh, no, I

00:52:36.940 --> 00:52:39.640
have something at the end here.

00:52:39.640 --> 00:52:41.299
Let's go back quickly.

00:52:41.299 --> 00:52:43.840
I'll share with you a couple of
the things that I think about

00:52:43.840 --> 00:52:46.540
as I reflect over investments,
courtesy of these two

00:52:46.540 --> 00:52:48.280
gentlemen.

00:52:48.280 --> 00:52:51.300
So you can look at
Charlie Munger's musings--

00:52:51.300 --> 00:52:53.020
"invert, invert, invert."

00:52:53.020 --> 00:52:55.440
I suspect most of you
know all of these points

00:52:55.440 --> 00:52:58.560
because you're
students of investing.

00:52:58.560 --> 00:53:00.870
But that invert is very
similar to what Warren

00:53:00.870 --> 00:53:03.900
said when he said if something's
not worth doing at all,

00:53:03.900 --> 00:53:05.950
don't do it.

00:53:05.950 --> 00:53:08.450
Invert means go to where
you want to end up,

00:53:08.450 --> 00:53:10.450
and then reason backwards
the most efficient way

00:53:10.450 --> 00:53:10.780
to get there.

00:53:10.780 --> 00:53:12.340
And just don't go
to the other places

00:53:12.340 --> 00:53:16.370
along the way that tie
up most people's bother.

00:53:16.370 --> 00:53:18.130
Figure it out,
and then work back

00:53:18.130 --> 00:53:20.520
from the outcome you desire.

00:53:20.520 --> 00:53:23.860
Warren-- Charlie
talked once about--

00:53:23.860 --> 00:53:25.820
this is very profound.

00:53:25.820 --> 00:53:28.330
They owned 7% of
Freddie Mac, which

00:53:28.330 --> 00:53:31.150
was the largest mortgage
insurance company,

00:53:31.150 --> 00:53:32.930
government-sponsored entity.

00:53:32.930 --> 00:53:36.829
And I was at the annual
meeting for Charlie's company.

00:53:36.829 --> 00:53:38.370
And someone said
why did you sell it?

00:53:38.370 --> 00:53:40.880
Because a guy who
actually quite a whiner--

00:53:40.880 --> 00:53:43.240
he was whining at
Charlie Munger,

00:53:43.240 --> 00:53:45.580
saying the stock was
at 47 when you sold it.

00:53:45.580 --> 00:53:47.200
It's now 70.

00:53:47.200 --> 00:53:48.820
Why did you sell that?

00:53:48.820 --> 00:53:50.770
And should we think
about replacing you

00:53:50.770 --> 00:53:52.480
as the investment officer?

00:53:52.480 --> 00:53:54.580
And Charlie was a bit peeved.

00:53:54.580 --> 00:53:57.010
And he looked out at this
guy, waited for a long time.

00:53:57.010 --> 00:53:59.580
And he said in response to the
question, why did you sell it,

00:53:59.580 --> 00:54:04.220
he said because we felt
like it, simple as that.

00:54:04.220 --> 00:54:06.079
It's such a powerful answer.

00:54:06.079 --> 00:54:07.620
It turns out that
there were reasons.

00:54:07.620 --> 00:54:11.070
They had put junk bonds
in their portfolio.

00:54:11.070 --> 00:54:13.370
They had retained
mortgages instead

00:54:13.370 --> 00:54:16.920
of just securitizing them.

00:54:16.920 --> 00:54:20.670
And they were
going into subprime

00:54:20.670 --> 00:54:24.180
to sort of generate unnatural
reinvestment when they should

00:54:24.180 --> 00:54:26.320
have been patient, anyways.

00:54:26.320 --> 00:54:27.320
All those were going on.

00:54:27.320 --> 00:54:30.390
But he basically
said, you know, we

00:54:30.390 --> 00:54:36.430
spent all of our lifetime
trying to figure out businesses.

00:54:36.430 --> 00:54:40.840
And when you have a response
based on your judgment

00:54:40.840 --> 00:54:44.280
that you can't actually
put your finger on,

00:54:44.280 --> 00:54:46.050
you're still supposed
to act on it.

00:54:46.050 --> 00:54:49.500
Most people overly
value knowledge,

00:54:49.500 --> 00:54:54.510
thinking that it is
the trump card when

00:54:54.510 --> 00:54:58.980
beliefs well-informed are
really what you have to act on.

00:54:58.980 --> 00:55:00.600
But basically what
Charlie said is

00:55:00.600 --> 00:55:04.620
they felt uncomfortable
some reason, but just

00:55:04.620 --> 00:55:06.150
the general development.

00:55:06.150 --> 00:55:08.740
And so they sold $7
billion worth of a stock.

00:55:08.740 --> 00:55:12.870
Now, most people would be fired
if they operated with what

00:55:12.870 --> 00:55:15.060
seems so thin as a reason.

00:55:15.060 --> 00:55:18.137
But you spend your life
developing judgment.

00:55:18.137 --> 00:55:20.220
And then failure to act
on it because you're still

00:55:20.220 --> 00:55:24.000
waiting for more
information is dangerous.

00:55:24.000 --> 00:55:27.390
The world is full of an 80/20
rule, and in many instances

00:55:27.390 --> 00:55:28.290
80% is enough.

00:55:31.170 --> 00:55:34.000
So that's one.

00:55:34.000 --> 00:55:36.774
Warren and Charlie
were asked this year

00:55:36.774 --> 00:55:39.190
at the meeting why they didn't
do something that was quite

00:55:39.190 --> 00:55:40.360
dangerous to their capital.

00:55:40.360 --> 00:55:42.460
And they said basically
it's because they want

00:55:42.460 --> 00:55:45.131
to be rational, not brilliant.

00:55:45.131 --> 00:55:46.630
Another firm, an
insurance business,

00:55:46.630 --> 00:55:48.296
did something that
cost them $3 billion.

00:55:48.296 --> 00:55:49.540
Warren didn't.

00:55:49.540 --> 00:55:52.330
And the reason was that
the other firm was looking

00:55:52.330 --> 00:55:55.000
for something that
would be brilliant

00:55:55.000 --> 00:55:57.880
and Warren and Charlie
passed because they just

00:55:57.880 --> 00:56:03.640
needed the very simple
test of being irrational.

00:56:03.640 --> 00:56:07.380
I think I'm going to stop.

00:56:07.380 --> 00:56:11.050
[INAUDIBLE] asked me to
give one last thing, which

00:56:11.050 --> 00:56:14.600
is my own lessons learned.

00:56:14.600 --> 00:56:17.710
And I say that the first
one is compound interest.

00:56:17.710 --> 00:56:19.360
And that's a career story.

00:56:19.360 --> 00:56:21.760
You'll start your
career out now.

00:56:21.760 --> 00:56:25.420
And 20 years from now, it'll
depend on those little steps

00:56:25.420 --> 00:56:30.220
that you take well that over
time add up to big results.

00:56:30.220 --> 00:56:32.200
And you'll see
people in business

00:56:32.200 --> 00:56:35.530
early on who take
big steps early on.

00:56:35.530 --> 00:56:37.450
And you should know
that along the way,

00:56:37.450 --> 00:56:40.360
they'll probably
fall along the side.

00:56:40.360 --> 00:56:43.210
And staying the
course and building

00:56:43.210 --> 00:56:50.947
a platform that's very
cumulative is a good character.

00:56:50.947 --> 00:56:52.030
You know, Buffett says it.

00:56:52.030 --> 00:56:53.080
I think it's true.

00:56:53.080 --> 00:56:55.510
Reputation takes a
lifetime to build,

00:56:55.510 --> 00:56:57.020
and you can destroy
it in a minute.

00:56:57.020 --> 00:56:59.140
So I mean, that's clear.

00:56:59.140 --> 00:57:01.060
And he also says
how many people he

00:57:01.060 --> 00:57:06.410
finds in his life who spend a
lifetime sort of gaining wealth

00:57:06.410 --> 00:57:09.580
and do so at the risk of
their reputation, which

00:57:09.580 --> 00:57:11.799
at the end, when they're
rich, the only thing they

00:57:11.799 --> 00:57:13.090
care about is their reputation.

00:57:13.090 --> 00:57:15.594
So just make sure
that you recognize

00:57:15.594 --> 00:57:17.260
that if you give it
up, you're not going

00:57:17.260 --> 00:57:19.420
to get it back very easily.

00:57:19.420 --> 00:57:24.340
Capacity to do nothing
is vastly, vastly

00:57:24.340 --> 00:57:25.690
underappreciated.

00:57:25.690 --> 00:57:28.550
But sloth and lethargy, as they
say at Berkshire-- but for me,

00:57:28.550 --> 00:57:32.670
just not acting as
often I suppose.

00:57:32.670 --> 00:57:34.750
I turned over-- I have a
slide I didn't show you.

00:57:34.750 --> 00:57:40.500
Last year, our portfolio
return was 1.8%, 1.8%.

00:57:40.500 --> 00:57:42.700
And then, my business
school professor

00:57:42.700 --> 00:57:47.850
who sent me down this journey
of value investing globally,

00:57:47.850 --> 00:57:51.150
said everybody should make
sure that you have a folly.

00:57:51.150 --> 00:57:55.890
Something that makes no sense
that just adds enjoyment, pure,

00:57:55.890 --> 00:57:59.515
and that can't be justified.

00:57:59.515 --> 00:58:01.140
Those are some things
I leave you with.

00:58:01.140 --> 00:58:06.040
Those are from-- courtesy of
what you learn as you go along.

00:58:06.040 --> 00:58:07.800
There's a little time
left for questions.

00:58:07.800 --> 00:58:11.000
I hope you have some, and
I'm sorry if I ran late.

00:58:11.000 --> 00:58:12.760
Yep?

00:58:12.760 --> 00:58:13.260
Yeah.

00:58:13.260 --> 00:58:13.900
[APPLAUSE]

00:58:13.900 --> 00:58:14.400
Thank you.

00:58:17.580 --> 00:58:20.790
AUDIENCE: So I'd love to hear,
Tom, more about the five C's.

00:58:20.790 --> 00:58:24.270
And maybe if we could just
start with the last one.

00:58:24.270 --> 00:58:27.000
What is a folly of yours?

00:58:27.000 --> 00:58:28.590
TOM RUSSO: I say art, probably.

00:58:28.590 --> 00:58:30.720
My wife and I both like art.

00:58:30.720 --> 00:58:34.650
We like art by
artists who we know.

00:58:34.650 --> 00:58:38.840
We don't participate, you know.

00:58:38.840 --> 00:58:43.010
I think in art there's
a component that's

00:58:43.010 --> 00:58:44.790
it's just inspirational.

00:58:44.790 --> 00:58:47.730
And we stay within
that, rather than enter

00:58:47.730 --> 00:58:50.370
the world of commercial
art, which is

00:58:50.370 --> 00:58:53.250
what draws many people to it.

00:58:53.250 --> 00:58:56.910
That would be one thing that's
quite of interest to us.

00:58:59.660 --> 00:59:03.290
I'd say certainly a
folly is my tennis game.

00:59:03.290 --> 00:59:06.640
Because the prospects of it
adding much value over time

00:59:06.640 --> 00:59:07.520
is quite low.

00:59:07.520 --> 00:59:09.090
But I'm still quite interested.

00:59:09.090 --> 00:59:12.080
So those are the two.

00:59:12.080 --> 00:59:14.420
AUDIENCE: And Tom,
I remember when

00:59:14.420 --> 00:59:17.930
speaking on the
phone you also said

00:59:17.930 --> 00:59:19.660
about the importance
of character.

00:59:19.660 --> 00:59:20.360
TOM RUSSO: Yeah.

00:59:20.360 --> 00:59:26.000
AUDIENCE: And how even more than
let's say talent and intellect,

00:59:26.000 --> 00:59:29.680
you consider character
and culture to be key.

00:59:29.680 --> 00:59:33.050
I was wondering in terms
of life experiences

00:59:33.050 --> 00:59:35.660
that you draw from,
inspirations that you draw from,

00:59:35.660 --> 00:59:38.090
if you could talk to
us a little bit more.

00:59:38.090 --> 00:59:40.880
Especially because, not only
here, but a lot of people

00:59:40.880 --> 00:59:44.870
on the video are going to be
youngsters who are looking

00:59:44.870 --> 00:59:46.512
at your talk for inspiration.

00:59:46.512 --> 00:59:47.720
So that would appeal to them.

00:59:47.720 --> 00:59:49.640
TOM RUSSO: Well,
all's I can say is,

00:59:49.640 --> 00:59:53.450
when you get
cultures right, they

00:59:53.450 --> 00:59:56.030
have an extraordinary benefit.

00:59:56.030 --> 00:59:59.840
And Nestle would be the
place where I learned this.

00:59:59.840 --> 01:00:06.300
And it was a business that
just had a shared vision

01:00:06.300 --> 01:00:13.640
and had the ability to
align decisions along what

01:00:13.640 --> 01:00:17.240
was asked of them as
a culture, as well as

01:00:17.240 --> 01:00:19.520
the economic promise of it.

01:00:19.520 --> 01:00:23.300
I suspect that that culture
here is extraordinary.

01:00:23.300 --> 01:00:26.960
And as I said, I was here five
years ago when I first spoke.

01:00:26.960 --> 01:00:30.230
And I was with the group
after the presentation.

01:00:30.230 --> 01:00:33.290
And a very young person
who found his way,

01:00:33.290 --> 01:00:37.160
as so many do here,
with enormous talent

01:00:37.160 --> 01:00:39.890
provided an answer to a
question of a person in his mid

01:00:39.890 --> 01:00:44.360
to late 40s who just had
suggested he was stumped.

01:00:44.360 --> 01:00:46.620
And this very young
person said, have you

01:00:46.620 --> 01:00:48.470
considered the following?

01:00:48.470 --> 01:00:50.372
And you know, the
room was silent.

01:00:50.372 --> 01:00:52.080
There were sort of 12
people in the room.

01:00:52.080 --> 01:00:56.270
I thought, oh, this kid's going
to get his legs chopped off.

01:00:56.270 --> 01:01:02.330
And the older guy said,
no, but it's a great idea.

01:01:02.330 --> 01:01:04.980
And so he said that
in front of all of us,

01:01:04.980 --> 01:01:08.330
recognizing that he
didn't have that insight.

01:01:08.330 --> 01:01:09.530
This guy did.

01:01:09.530 --> 01:01:11.310
He was half his age.

01:01:11.310 --> 01:01:13.730
And he felt perfectly
comfortable applauding that

01:01:13.730 --> 01:01:15.840
as a possible source
of a solution.

01:01:15.840 --> 01:01:18.140
It's a very valuable
cultural thing.

01:01:18.140 --> 01:01:20.390
It does not exist
in most companies.

01:01:20.390 --> 01:01:25.640
Most companies are terribly
territorial over ideas,

01:01:25.640 --> 01:01:28.880
very loath to shed
praise broadly,

01:01:28.880 --> 01:01:32.450
and really loathe to extend
a hand to someone else.

01:01:32.450 --> 01:01:35.780
This is an
extraordinary character,

01:01:35.780 --> 01:01:39.810
and one that I would
hope is preservable.

01:01:39.810 --> 01:01:42.080
So that's a plug for yourselves.

01:01:42.080 --> 01:01:43.970
But it's an important one.

01:01:43.970 --> 01:01:45.620
AUDIENCE: And on
compound interest,

01:01:45.620 --> 01:01:48.350
I remember you had said to
me something along the lines

01:01:48.350 --> 01:01:52.730
of the returns being so back
ended that for the first, maybe

01:01:52.730 --> 01:01:56.090
decade or two of your
career, you didn't

01:01:56.090 --> 01:01:57.980
get a lot of recognition.

01:01:57.980 --> 01:01:59.540
I mean, stuff that
just comes to you.

01:01:59.540 --> 01:02:02.312
Maybe if you could talk to
us a little bit about that,

01:02:02.312 --> 01:02:04.020
people might find that
inspiring as well.

01:02:04.020 --> 01:02:06.740
TOM RUSSO: No, I must say, I
was at the hotel this morning.

01:02:06.740 --> 01:02:08.316
I came upon this.

01:02:08.316 --> 01:02:09.690
Well, that's sort
of interesting.

01:02:09.690 --> 01:02:12.590
He was a classmate of
mine in business school.

01:02:12.590 --> 01:02:16.870
And he didn't start out
owning the Warriors.

01:02:16.870 --> 01:02:18.860
But he ended up
owning the Warriors.

01:02:18.860 --> 01:02:20.640
And he's interviewed in here.

01:02:20.640 --> 01:02:22.850
And he said, when he
was eight or nine,

01:02:22.850 --> 01:02:26.275
he came upon the first indoor
basketball court he ever had.

01:02:26.275 --> 01:02:27.650
And he said someday
I may own it.

01:02:27.650 --> 01:02:29.480
But he started out in business.

01:02:29.480 --> 01:02:31.970
And it was just like this.

01:02:31.970 --> 01:02:37.770
But with the right direction
and a couple of good breaks

01:02:37.770 --> 01:02:43.130
and character that protected
him from overreaching too soon,

01:02:43.130 --> 01:02:45.200
he ends up with his dream.

01:02:45.200 --> 01:02:48.800
And I thought that
was quite telling.

01:02:48.800 --> 01:02:52.550
And I was impressed to see it.

01:02:52.550 --> 01:02:58.850
But I think the
remarkable notion

01:02:58.850 --> 01:03:02.770
is that a series of small
things add up over time

01:03:02.770 --> 01:03:05.090
and can richly reward.

01:03:05.090 --> 01:03:07.200
AUDIENCE: Was that
your experience, too?

01:03:07.200 --> 01:03:09.080
TOM RUSSO: Absolutely.

01:03:09.080 --> 01:03:13.550
I mean, I was with some
investors recently who had,

01:03:13.550 --> 01:03:19.760
over the past decade,
extraordinarily sort of visible

01:03:19.760 --> 01:03:23.330
and dynamic and
active businesses,

01:03:23.330 --> 01:03:25.550
and they've all, at some
level or other, sort

01:03:25.550 --> 01:03:28.070
of shut them down or restricted
them, moved them back.

01:03:28.070 --> 01:03:29.940
And he said, well,
what's the difference?

01:03:29.940 --> 01:03:33.050
How can you still be doing this,
and you don't even do anything?

01:03:33.050 --> 01:03:34.910
You know, you don't buy stocks.

01:03:34.910 --> 01:03:36.750
You hold companies
for a long time.

01:03:36.750 --> 01:03:38.460
And I sort of gave
the same answer.

01:03:38.460 --> 01:03:42.140
It was just by just
staying to the same thing

01:03:42.140 --> 01:03:46.010
we've been able to,
I think, find some

01:03:46.010 --> 01:03:48.830
interesting businesses that,
because of their own culture

01:03:48.830 --> 01:03:51.770
and character have been able
to redeploy capital internally

01:03:51.770 --> 01:03:54.470
without worrying about
quarterly numbers that's

01:03:54.470 --> 01:03:58.020
allowed it to stretch out
and deliver value over time.

01:03:58.020 --> 01:04:01.040
But you'll see a handful
of businesses like that.

01:04:01.040 --> 01:04:02.530
Yes?

01:04:02.530 --> 01:04:05.630
AUDIENCE: Is age of a business
a factor into when you

01:04:05.630 --> 01:04:07.430
decide to invest in something?

01:04:07.430 --> 01:04:10.910
Because there's all this talk
of getting into things early

01:04:10.910 --> 01:04:14.270
and then it's a very scary
aspect to start off with,

01:04:14.270 --> 01:04:18.710
because a lot of things just end
up being Wall Street gimmicks.

01:04:18.710 --> 01:04:19.930
TOM RUSSO: Yes.

01:04:19.930 --> 01:04:22.520
AUDIENCE: And so is
age a factor when you

01:04:22.520 --> 01:04:24.270
look at investable business?

01:04:24.270 --> 01:04:28.890
TOM RUSSO: So for me, I
oversee about $14 billion.

01:04:28.890 --> 01:04:32.720
And so I don't really have
the luxury of deploying that

01:04:32.720 --> 01:04:37.700
into businesses that are
really young, other than you

01:04:37.700 --> 01:04:39.080
and Amazon.

01:04:39.080 --> 01:04:41.510
I mean, there's this
extraordinary phenomenon

01:04:41.510 --> 01:04:46.280
right now where dynamic new
businesses are also enjoying

01:04:46.280 --> 01:04:48.140
extraordinary high valuations.

01:04:48.140 --> 01:04:50.210
So I have the
liquidity and the right

01:04:50.210 --> 01:04:55.640
to invest in these new
businesses and haven't yet.

01:04:55.640 --> 01:04:57.890
I'm impressed.

01:04:57.890 --> 01:05:00.560
And I see within
them something more

01:05:00.560 --> 01:05:03.110
than what I have been
led to believe up

01:05:03.110 --> 01:05:06.240
until recently, which is that,
oh, these are mere technology

01:05:06.240 --> 01:05:06.740
businesses.

01:05:06.740 --> 01:05:12.450
It's just much more disruptive,
more deeply disruptive.

01:05:12.450 --> 01:05:16.070
But size usually would keep
me out of new companies.

01:05:16.070 --> 01:05:20.640
But that's no justification here
because your caps are so large.

01:05:20.640 --> 01:05:24.150
And I think the four
leading members of things

01:05:24.150 --> 01:05:26.170
have a market capitalization.

01:05:26.170 --> 01:05:28.034
What you have is $2
trillion or something?

01:05:28.034 --> 01:05:28.950
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

01:05:28.950 --> 01:05:30.340
TOM RUSSO: More
than $2 trillion.

01:05:30.340 --> 01:05:33.390
So there's plenty
for me to find.

01:05:33.390 --> 01:05:45.900
So also new is the kind of
the threatened destroyer

01:05:45.900 --> 01:05:47.610
of our businesses
in many instances.

01:05:47.610 --> 01:05:50.520
Think about Jack Daniels.

01:05:50.520 --> 01:05:54.780
And suddenly you have Bulleit
and you have Hudson Whiskey.

01:05:54.780 --> 01:05:59.130
And the more difficult
the search of discovery

01:05:59.130 --> 01:06:01.710
is for something
that's new and new,

01:06:01.710 --> 01:06:03.970
the more it's rewarded today.

01:06:03.970 --> 01:06:06.420
And so across all
of our investments,

01:06:06.420 --> 01:06:13.260
we actually are engaged in
mortal warfare against the new,

01:06:13.260 --> 01:06:16.920
while at the same time trying
to reinterpret that which made

01:06:16.920 --> 01:06:20.980
those businesses which
we rely upon once great

01:06:20.980 --> 01:06:22.770
will allow them to
continue to stay great.

01:06:22.770 --> 01:06:24.690
So they have to become
new in themselves.

01:06:24.690 --> 01:06:26.730
And that's what this
thing was all about.

01:06:26.730 --> 01:06:30.330
Here's a tobacco company which
is the most profitable company

01:06:30.330 --> 01:06:33.510
in the world coming up
with a product that's

01:06:33.510 --> 01:06:37.530
destined to eliminate the
business which they've

01:06:37.530 --> 01:06:39.270
relied upon for so long.

01:06:39.270 --> 01:06:41.460
One of the musings that
Charlie Munger has,

01:06:41.460 --> 01:06:45.030
which I think is so profound,
about Berkshire Hathaway is

01:06:45.030 --> 01:06:50.670
he said, at some
point, that which made

01:06:50.670 --> 01:06:53.280
us great at Berkshire
is most likely

01:06:53.280 --> 01:06:55.530
not to be that which
will keep us great

01:06:55.530 --> 01:06:56.950
or allow us to
become more great.

01:06:56.950 --> 01:06:58.740
I actually don't
have it up there.

01:06:58.740 --> 01:07:00.289
But no, I see it.

01:07:00.289 --> 01:07:01.830
It's that which made
Berkshire great.

01:07:01.830 --> 01:07:03.130
It's right in the middle.

01:07:03.130 --> 01:07:07.920
And you know, he's
94, and understands

01:07:07.920 --> 01:07:14.280
that if you don't modify what's
gotten you well-served today,

01:07:14.280 --> 01:07:21.550
you run the risk of
missing the next turn.

01:07:21.550 --> 01:07:22.240
We've run over.

01:07:22.240 --> 01:07:23.406
Yes, do you have a question?

01:07:25.944 --> 01:07:28.360
AUDIENCE: You said you did not
have a very good experience

01:07:28.360 --> 01:07:29.734
in the newspaper
industry, right?

01:07:29.734 --> 01:07:30.550
TOM RUSSO: Yes.

01:07:30.550 --> 01:07:35.140
AUDIENCE: So what are your
learnings from that experience.

01:07:35.140 --> 01:07:42.520
And how do you suggest us
to evaluate media companies?

01:07:42.520 --> 01:07:46.480
TOM RUSSO: Well, it really
is just an excessive amount

01:07:46.480 --> 01:07:49.090
of contentedness that
the industry fell

01:07:49.090 --> 01:07:53.800
into when they finally
had all basically merged

01:07:53.800 --> 01:07:56.920
into single newspaper towns.

01:07:56.920 --> 01:08:00.850
And I have a funny view on this.

01:08:03.630 --> 01:08:11.530
I sort of take it back to
almost the time of Watergate,

01:08:11.530 --> 01:08:14.696
when newspapers played
such an important role.

01:08:14.696 --> 01:08:16.779
"The Washington Post"
played such a important role

01:08:16.779 --> 01:08:20.359
in breaking open a
political scandal

01:08:20.359 --> 01:08:24.640
that the role of newspapers at
that moment sort of changed.

01:08:24.640 --> 01:08:31.479
And they really took
a turn towards sort

01:08:31.479 --> 01:08:34.075
of trying to find the next
story, the next story,

01:08:34.075 --> 01:08:36.350
along those big
headline grabbing ways.

01:08:36.350 --> 01:08:39.310
And the best
newspapers, the ones

01:08:39.310 --> 01:08:41.649
that really make money
and that are really

01:08:41.649 --> 01:08:44.380
part of the community
are those which

01:08:44.380 --> 01:08:48.850
are focused intently on local.

01:08:48.850 --> 01:08:54.220
And so they have seven pictures
of the high school football

01:08:54.220 --> 01:08:55.430
team engaged.

01:08:55.430 --> 01:09:00.850
And they have stories about who
was arrested, who was married,

01:09:00.850 --> 01:09:02.319
who died.

01:09:02.319 --> 01:09:06.189
It's the stuff of the
communities that really create.

01:09:06.189 --> 01:09:12.370
But the lure of Pulitzer
Prize-winning kind

01:09:12.370 --> 01:09:20.380
of expose journalism became
hyper-charged after Watergate.

01:09:20.380 --> 01:09:23.229
And I think that that
shriveled, just sort

01:09:23.229 --> 01:09:24.939
of shredded the
intimate relationship

01:09:24.939 --> 01:09:27.130
that a paper had with its town.

01:09:27.130 --> 01:09:30.479
And the papers that
still exist are those--

01:09:30.479 --> 01:09:31.840
and they still make some money.

01:09:31.840 --> 01:09:36.279
But they're a lot thinner,
and they focus on the area.

01:09:36.279 --> 01:09:41.020
Now advertising, as you better
than anyone else would know,

01:09:41.020 --> 01:09:45.189
is becoming a really
fascinating story

01:09:45.189 --> 01:09:48.399
of sort of personal testimonials
and a personal search

01:09:48.399 --> 01:09:52.210
for something that you can
friend and then tell others

01:09:52.210 --> 01:09:53.740
about.

01:09:53.740 --> 01:09:56.740
And that is very interesting.

01:09:56.740 --> 01:10:00.130
Because newspapers as
they were historically

01:10:00.130 --> 01:10:03.880
set up as advertising
vehicles, the advertising

01:10:03.880 --> 01:10:06.700
paid for the content.

01:10:06.700 --> 01:10:09.170
And the content is
what drew the eyeballs

01:10:09.170 --> 01:10:11.300
that advertisers cared about.

01:10:11.300 --> 01:10:16.330
Today the advertising is very
specific, very purposeful.

01:10:16.330 --> 01:10:18.910
And so the ancillary
advertising that

01:10:18.910 --> 01:10:22.159
arose from just the
presence of having content

01:10:22.159 --> 01:10:23.950
that you wanted to see
and you accidentally

01:10:23.950 --> 01:10:28.060
saw an advertisement next
to it is very old-fashioned.

01:10:28.060 --> 01:10:31.400
Advertising these days
is placed with a purpose,

01:10:31.400 --> 01:10:32.860
and it's often itself.

01:10:32.860 --> 01:10:35.230
You know, it's not collateral.

01:10:35.230 --> 01:10:41.020
And accordingly, it's
becoming far more effective.

01:10:41.020 --> 01:10:47.950
Because the idea is
that information informs

01:10:47.950 --> 01:10:53.140
that you were about to buy a
red sweater, because of all

01:10:53.140 --> 01:10:54.690
of the prior steps you've taken.

01:10:54.690 --> 01:10:57.820
And you know, the guy who
sells red sweaters wants

01:10:57.820 --> 01:10:59.850
to know about that on time.

01:10:59.850 --> 01:11:01.820
And so that's a very
different world.

01:11:01.820 --> 01:11:02.740
It's very powerful.

01:11:06.154 --> 01:11:08.320
SPEAKER 1: And with that,
I think we're out of time.

01:11:08.320 --> 01:11:10.170
Thank you so much, Mr. Russo.

01:11:10.170 --> 01:11:10.750
Thank you.

01:11:10.750 --> 01:11:11.250
[APPLAUSE]

01:11:11.250 --> 01:11:12.800
TOM RUSSO: Pleasure.
