change comes in all forms right now it
comes in little pieces big pieces

tend to be still episodic one hits you

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:24.220
tend to be still episodic one hits you
 

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:26.580
tend to be still episodic one hits you
then another hit you although the

direction we're going right now is not

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:29.050
direction we're going right now is not
 

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:32.940
direction we're going right now is not
only lots of small but more frequent big

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:32.950
only lots of small but more frequent big
 

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:35.940
only lots of small but more frequent big
changes and that's the direction of

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:35.950
changes and that's the direction of
 

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:41.450
changes and that's the direction of
future is going to be

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460
 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:45.360
the rate of change very clearly is going

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:45.370
the rate of change very clearly is going
 

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:48.330
the rate of change very clearly is going
up has been for some time all kinds of

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:48.340
up has been for some time all kinds of
 

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:51.630
up has been for some time all kinds of
statistics will show that I think the

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:51.640
statistics will show that I think the
 

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:54.350
statistics will show that I think the
two big biggest drivers are

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360
two big biggest drivers are
 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:57.660
two big biggest drivers are
technological change and globalization

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:57.670
technological change and globalization
 

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:00.840
technological change and globalization
they produce lots of sub drivers like

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:00.850
they produce lots of sub drivers like
 

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:03.020
they produce lots of sub drivers like
competition in industries and the like

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030
competition in industries and the like
 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:07.310
competition in industries and the like
and those two are not going to go away

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320
and those two are not going to go away
 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.540
and those two are not going to go away
globalization is going to bring us

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:09.550
globalization is going to bring us
 

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:11.190
globalization is going to bring us
closer and closer together across

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:11.200
closer and closer together across
 

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:14.730
closer and closer together across
nations and technology you can't stop so

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:14.740
nations and technology you can't stop so
 

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:18.060
nations and technology you can't stop so
the amount of change is going to I think

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:18.070
the amount of change is going to I think
 

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:21.090
the amount of change is going to I think
in the rate just go up and up and up for

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:21.100
in the rate just go up and up and up for
 

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:26.590
in the rate just go up and up and up for
I don't know how long

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:26.600
 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:30.200
innovation is kind of a sub piece of

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210
innovation is kind of a sub piece of
 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:36.500
innovation is kind of a sub piece of
change it's very difficult to innovate

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:36.510
change it's very difficult to innovate
 

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:40.370
change it's very difficult to innovate
without requiring people to do something

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380
without requiring people to do something
 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:42.290
without requiring people to do something
different and whenever you require

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:42.300
different and whenever you require
 

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:44.630
different and whenever you require
people to do something different you're

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640
people to do something different you're
 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:48.320
people to do something different you're
talking about change so there are lots

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:48.330
talking about change so there are lots
 

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:52.130
talking about change so there are lots
of other kinds of change but innovation

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140
of other kinds of change but innovation
 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:54.380
of other kinds of change but innovation
is a particularly interesting one right

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390
is a particularly interesting one right
 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:02:00.620
is a particularly interesting one right
now especially when you need new ideas

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630
now especially when you need new ideas
 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:03.350
now especially when you need new ideas
and new ways of doing things to be able

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360
and new ways of doing things to be able
 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:09.230
and new ways of doing things to be able
to compete prosper etc
