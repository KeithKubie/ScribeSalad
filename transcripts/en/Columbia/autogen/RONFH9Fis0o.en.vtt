may be true that the colonization begins

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:05.110
may be true that the colonization begins
 

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:07.920
may be true that the colonization begins
with under colonialism but it certainly

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:26.050
achieved which of course we even
 

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:28.380
achieved which of course we even
questioned extent to which independence

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:28.390

incomplete project that demands care and
 

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:46.140
incomplete project that demands care and
attention and I think that in a way I

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:46.150
attention and I think that in a way I
 

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:49.190
attention and I think that in a way I
would have to have a difference with the

the same type of socialism not that
socialism is not important but if I were

00:02:59.769 --> 00:03:01.380
to have select one fundamental that they
were in phenomena like the first one

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:01.390
