TIMOTHY JORDAN: Hello,
I'm Timothy Jordan.

00:00:03.690 --> 00:00:05.117
And this week I'm in Tokyo.

00:00:05.117 --> 00:00:06.340
Isn't that cool?

00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:09.630
OK, here's the TL;DR, your
update of the latest developer

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:11.870
news from Google.

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:14.020
Want to know how to build
a native chat application

00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:15.650
with Firebase and App Engine?

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:17.420
Here's a step-by-step
guide and sample

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:20.190
code for both an Android
app and an App Engine-based

00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:21.300
back-end service.

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:25.470
It's all available on the
link in the description below.

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:27.690
In the latest episode of
the Mobile Ads Garage,

00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:29.680
David East joins
host Andrew Broadbent

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:31.850
to cover Firebase
for AdMob Publishers,

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:34.780
including how to import
both SDKs into a project

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:37.706
and how to link an AdMob
app to a Firebase project

00:00:37.706 --> 00:00:39.330
so you can take
advantage of Firebase's

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:42.110
free and unlimited analytics.

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:44.460
Game developer Rayark just
hit two million downloads

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:46.960
with their game "VOEZ," which
is running in production

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:48.710
on Google Container Engine.

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:52.520
Take a look at the post for
principles to their success.

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:56.200
Kubernetes 1.3 is ready to roll
out on Google Container Engine

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:59.370
and will be available to all
customers over the coming week.

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:01.550
The latest release
addresses many top requests,

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:03.460
including services
that span availability

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:06.090
zones, built-in support
for stateful applications,

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:09.684
and doubling the number of
nodes in a cluster to 2,000.

00:01:09.684 --> 00:01:12.100
For more details including the
latest updates to Container

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:14.100
Engine, check out the post.

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.050
Now, this is a
really cool article

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:18.740
over on our Web Updates page
about what to consider when

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:20.450
building an infinite scroller.

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:23.170
Spoiler alert-- reuse
your dom elements,

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:25.640
and remove the ones that are
far away from the viewport.

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:28.820
Also, use placeholders to
account for delayed data.

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:32.880
Jump to the post for details,
a demo, and the code.

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:35.560
To build products that
work for billions of users,

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:37.780
you need to address a
few key challenges--

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:40.310
limited or intermittent
connectivity, device

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:43.500
compatibility, varying screen
sizes, high data costs,

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.960
and short-lived batteries.

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:49.170
Take a look at the post for
best practices on both web

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:51.120
and Android to help
you reach billions

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:53.480
by delivering exceptional
performance in spite

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:55.380
of these issues.

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:59.010
Game developer Balloon Island
increased revenue by about 150%

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:00.610
with AdMob Mediation.

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:03.780
To learn how, check
out the case study.

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:05.570
