know from our camera and our mic and
 

00:07:36.079 --> 00:07:38.769
know from our camera and our mic and
then we need to be able to make a

00:07:38.769 --> 00:07:38.779
then we need to be able to make a
 

00:07:38.779 --> 00:07:40.569
then we need to be able to make a
connection between the two peers you

00:07:40.569 --> 00:07:40.579
connection between the two peers you
 

00:07:40.579 --> 00:07:42.209
connection between the two peers you
know the caller and the colleague and

00:07:42.209 --> 00:07:42.219

that needs to be able to cope with the

that needs to be able to cope with the
real world of naxx and firewalls and so

00:07:47.319 --> 00:07:47.329
real world of naxx and firewalls and so
 

00:07:47.329 --> 00:07:50.319
real world of naxx and firewalls and so
on once we've made that connection we

on once we've made that connection we
 

00:07:50.329 --> 00:07:52.869
on once we've made that connection we
need to be able then have really high

00:08:12.829 --> 00:08:15.249
also always been this idea that we could
communicate arbitrary data as well so

00:08:15.249 --> 00:08:15.259
communicate arbitrary data as well so
 

00:08:15.259 --> 00:08:18.219
communicate arbitrary data as well so
not just audio and video but all types

00:08:18.219 --> 00:08:18.229
not just audio and video but all types
 

00:08:18.229 --> 00:08:20.589
not just audio and video but all types
of data binary data text and so on and

00:08:20.589 --> 00:08:20.599
of data binary data text and so on and
 

00:08:20.599 --> 00:08:22.479
of data binary data text and so on and
we're seeing some you know really

00:08:22.479 --> 00:08:22.489
we're seeing some you know really
 

00:08:22.489 --> 00:08:24.369
we're seeing some you know really
interesting use cases for that coming

00:08:24.369 --> 00:08:24.379
interesting use cases for that coming
 

00:08:24.379 --> 00:08:28.889
interesting use cases for that coming
through so for this we have three api's

00:08:28.889 --> 00:08:28.899
through so for this we have three api's
 

00:08:28.899 --> 00:08:32.259

00:08:40.639 --> 00:08:43.299
that's like the most i've seen if that's
fantastic and then of course we have our

00:08:43.299 --> 00:08:43.309
fantastic and then of course we have our
 

00:08:43.309 --> 00:08:46.840
fantastic and then of course we have our

so you get some some media and then you

00:08:55.410 --> 00:08:55.420
so you get some some media and then you
 

00:08:55.420 --> 00:08:58.829
so you get some some media and then you
plumb that into our tcp connection to

00:08:58.829 --> 00:08:58.839
plumb that into our tcp connection to
 

00:08:58.839 --> 00:09:00.810
plumb that into our tcp connection to
get it to the other side once you get at

your media streaming then you can do
 

00:09:04.149 --> 00:09:06.960
your media streaming then you can do
something like plug that into a video

00:09:06.960 --> 00:09:06.970
something like plug that into a video
 

00:09:06.970 --> 00:09:11.360
something like plug that into a video
elements of course it's not that simple

if you want to have a look at web RTC

00:10:02.430 --> 00:10:02.440
if you want to have a look at web RTC
 

00:10:02.440 --> 00:10:04.650
if you want to have a look at web RTC
check this out this is kind of the

00:10:04.650 --> 00:10:04.660
check this out this is kind of the
 

00:10:04.660 --> 00:10:06.630
check this out this is kind of the
absolute basics we also have a kind of

00:10:06.630 --> 00:10:06.640
absolute basics we also have a kind of
 

00:10:06.640 --> 00:10:09.030
absolute basics we also have a kind of
full-fat video chat app which is

00:10:09.030 --> 00:10:09.040
full-fat video chat app which is
 

00:10:09.040 --> 00:10:10.680
full-fat video chat app which is
maintained by google which kind of does

00:10:10.680 --> 00:10:10.690
maintained by google which kind of does
 

00:10:10.690 --> 00:10:13.620

everything and has really verbose

00:10:13.620 --> 00:10:13.630
everything and has really verbose
 

00:10:13.630 --> 00:10:15.300
everything and has really verbose
logging so it's a you know a good place

00:10:15.300 --> 00:10:15.310
logging so it's a you know a good place
 

00:10:15.310 --> 00:10:18.540
logging so it's a you know a good place
to work out what's going on think about

00:10:18.540 --> 00:10:18.550
to work out what's going on think about
 

00:10:18.550 --> 00:10:20.400
to work out what's going on think about
RTC data channel like I say this is the

00:10:20.400 --> 00:10:20.410
RTC data channel like I say this is the
 

00:10:20.410 --> 00:10:23.189
RTC data channel like I say this is the
API for other kinds of data arbitrary

00:10:23.189 --> 00:10:23.199
API for other kinds of data arbitrary
 

00:10:23.199 --> 00:10:24.930
API for other kinds of data arbitrary
data yeah imagine you're playing a game

00:10:24.930 --> 00:10:24.940
data yeah imagine you're playing a game
 

00:10:24.940 --> 00:10:26.670
data yeah imagine you're playing a game
and highly simplified but you know you

00:10:26.670 --> 00:10:26.680
and highly simplified but you know you
 

00:10:26.680 --> 00:10:30.329
and highly simplified but you know you
want to exchange player positions for

00:10:30.329 --> 00:10:30.339
want to exchange player positions for
 

00:10:30.339 --> 00:10:32.280
want to exchange player positions for
example and do that with with low

00:10:32.280 --> 00:10:32.290
example and do that with with low
 

00:10:32.290 --> 00:10:34.019
example and do that with with low
latency and kind of effectively you know

00:10:34.019 --> 00:10:34.029
latency and kind of effectively you know
 

00:10:34.029 --> 00:10:37.889
latency and kind of effectively you know
trying for real time where we have you

00:10:37.889 --> 00:10:37.899
trying for real time where we have you
 

00:10:37.899 --> 00:10:40.410
trying for real time where we have you
know RTC data channel for that and this

00:10:40.410 --> 00:10:40.420
know RTC data channel for that and this
 

00:10:40.420 --> 00:10:44.150
know RTC data channel for that and this
has exactly I know who is ringing

00:10:44.150 --> 00:10:44.160
has exactly I know who is ringing
 

00:10:44.160 --> 00:10:47.670
has exactly I know who is ringing
someone so this has exactly the same

00:10:47.670 --> 00:10:47.680
someone so this has exactly the same
 

00:10:47.680 --> 00:10:51.960
someone so this has exactly the same
api's WebSocket but you know what we're

00:10:51.960 --> 00:10:51.970
api's WebSocket but you know what we're
 

00:10:51.970 --> 00:10:54.059
api's WebSocket but you know what we're
aiming for his is really low latency

00:10:54.059 --> 00:10:54.069
aiming for his is really low latency
 

00:10:54.069 --> 00:10:56.160
aiming for his is really low latency
firstly because the idea is that you

00:10:56.160 --> 00:10:56.170
firstly because the idea is that you
 

00:10:56.170 --> 00:10:59.360
firstly because the idea is that you
communicating directly between peers and

00:10:59.360 --> 00:10:59.370
communicating directly between peers and
 

00:10:59.370 --> 00:11:02.819
communicating directly between peers and
you know using the like sctp protocol

00:11:02.819 --> 00:11:02.829
you know using the like sctp protocol
 

00:11:02.829 --> 00:11:04.620
you know using the like sctp protocol
means we have a lot of the advantages of

00:11:04.620 --> 00:11:04.630
means we have a lot of the advantages of
 

00:11:04.630 --> 00:11:06.150
means we have a lot of the advantages of
UDP so what

00:11:06.150 --> 00:11:06.160
UDP so what
 

00:11:06.160 --> 00:11:10.379
UDP so what
we can do is optionally specify that we

00:11:10.379 --> 00:11:10.389
we can do is optionally specify that we
 

00:11:10.389 --> 00:11:13.470
we can do is optionally specify that we
don't need the connection to be reliable

00:11:13.470 --> 00:11:13.480
don't need the connection to be reliable
 

00:11:13.480 --> 00:11:14.850
don't need the connection to be reliable
in other words you think if you're

00:11:14.850 --> 00:11:14.860
in other words you think if you're
 

00:11:14.860 --> 00:11:16.439
in other words you think if you're
exchanging player positions it doesn't

00:11:16.439 --> 00:11:16.449
exchanging player positions it doesn't
 

00:11:16.449 --> 00:11:18.420
exchanging player positions it doesn't
matter if you lose some packets along

00:11:18.420 --> 00:11:18.430
matter if you lose some packets along
 

00:11:18.430 --> 00:11:20.249
matter if you lose some packets along
the way what you really want is high

00:11:20.249 --> 00:11:20.259
the way what you really want is high
 

00:11:20.259 --> 00:11:23.129
the way what you really want is high
performance whereas safer file-sharing

00:11:23.129 --> 00:11:23.139
performance whereas safer file-sharing
 

00:11:23.139 --> 00:11:24.900
performance whereas safer file-sharing
you know you can't lose any bits that's

00:11:24.900 --> 00:11:24.910
you know you can't lose any bits that's
 

00:11:24.910 --> 00:11:26.939
you know you can't lose any bits that's
not going to work so you might take a

00:11:26.939 --> 00:11:26.949
not going to work so you might take a
 

00:11:26.949 --> 00:11:28.920
not going to work so you might take a
slight hit on performance to make sure

00:11:28.920 --> 00:11:28.930
slight hit on performance to make sure
 

00:11:28.930 --> 00:11:33.059
slight hit on performance to make sure
that that the transport is reliable so

00:11:33.059 --> 00:11:33.069
that that the transport is reliable so
 

00:11:33.069 --> 00:11:34.470
that that the transport is reliable so
again if you want to check this out it's

00:11:34.470 --> 00:11:34.480
again if you want to check this out it's
 

00:11:34.480 --> 00:11:37.379
again if you want to check this out it's
a good place to start just wanted to

00:11:37.379 --> 00:11:37.389
a good place to start just wanted to
 

00:11:37.389 --> 00:11:40.309
a good place to start just wanted to
show you a really nice app I've seen

00:11:40.309 --> 00:11:40.319
show you a really nice app I've seen
 

00:11:40.319 --> 00:11:43.079
show you a really nice app I've seen
using this I don't have people have seen

00:11:43.079 --> 00:11:43.089
using this I don't have people have seen
 

00:11:43.089 --> 00:11:46.019
using this I don't have people have seen
share fest but what this gives us the

00:11:46.019 --> 00:11:46.029
share fest but what this gives us the
 

00:11:46.029 --> 00:11:49.860
share fest but what this gives us the
ability to share files using RTC data

00:11:49.860 --> 00:11:49.870
ability to share files using RTC data
 

00:11:49.870 --> 00:11:53.309
ability to share files using RTC data
channel without having to go through an

00:11:53.309 --> 00:11:53.319
channel without having to go through an
 

00:11:53.319 --> 00:11:55.050
channel without having to go through an
intermediary service so what I've done

00:11:55.050 --> 00:11:55.060
intermediary service so what I've done
 

00:11:55.060 --> 00:11:57.480
intermediary service so what I've done
is I've selected a file there chef s

00:11:57.480 --> 00:11:57.490
is I've selected a file there chef s
 

00:11:57.490 --> 00:11:59.129
is I've selected a file there chef s
gives me a URL and then I can do

00:11:59.129 --> 00:11:59.139
gives me a URL and then I can do
 

00:11:59.139 --> 00:12:02.699
gives me a URL and then I can do
something like post that URL to someone

00:12:02.699 --> 00:12:02.709
something like post that URL to someone
 

00:12:02.709 --> 00:12:06.600
something like post that URL to someone
and then they can open that that file at

00:12:06.600 --> 00:12:06.610
and then they can open that that file at
 

00:12:06.610 --> 00:12:08.429
and then they can open that that file at
the other end so when they come to open

00:12:08.429 --> 00:12:08.439
the other end so when they come to open
 

00:12:08.439 --> 00:12:10.470
the other end so when they come to open
that file a peer connection will be

00:12:10.470 --> 00:12:10.480
that file a peer connection will be
 

00:12:10.480 --> 00:12:12.720
that file a peer connection will be
established between the two browsers so

00:12:12.720 --> 00:12:12.730
established between the two browsers so
 

00:12:12.730 --> 00:12:15.960
established between the two browsers so
to speak and then data transfer the file

00:12:15.960 --> 00:12:15.970
to speak and then data transfer the file
 

00:12:15.970 --> 00:12:18.420
to speak and then data transfer the file
will happen directly between the two

00:12:18.420 --> 00:12:18.430
will happen directly between the two
 

00:12:18.430 --> 00:12:19.829
will happen directly between the two
without like a site going by an

00:12:19.829 --> 00:12:19.839
without like a site going by an
 

00:12:19.839 --> 00:12:22.069
without like a site going by an
intermediary server so kind of

00:12:22.069 --> 00:12:22.079
intermediary server so kind of
 

00:12:22.079 --> 00:12:26.280
intermediary server so kind of
interesting stuff going on there perhaps

00:12:26.280 --> 00:12:26.290
interesting stuff going on there perhaps
 

00:12:26.290 --> 00:12:28.230
interesting stuff going on there perhaps
a more radical project have people seen

00:12:28.230 --> 00:12:28.240
a more radical project have people seen
 

00:12:28.240 --> 00:12:30.540
a more radical project have people seen
like peer CDN this this blows me away

00:12:30.540 --> 00:12:30.550
like peer CDN this this blows me away
 

00:12:30.550 --> 00:12:33.710
like peer CDN this this blows me away
this is this idea of a peer-to-peer

00:12:33.710 --> 00:12:33.720
this is this idea of a peer-to-peer
 

00:12:33.720 --> 00:12:36.990
this is this idea of a peer-to-peer
content distribution using RTC data

00:12:36.990 --> 00:12:37.000
content distribution using RTC data
 

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:38.970
content distribution using RTC data
channels so the way it works is that you

00:12:38.970 --> 00:12:38.980
channels so the way it works is that you
 

00:12:38.980 --> 00:12:41.879
channels so the way it works is that you
put a link to peer cdns JavaScript at

00:12:41.879 --> 00:12:41.889
put a link to peer cdns JavaScript at
 

00:12:41.889 --> 00:12:45.629
put a link to peer cdns JavaScript at
the top of your web page and then the

00:12:45.629 --> 00:12:45.639
the top of your web page and then the
 

00:12:45.639 --> 00:12:47.879
the top of your web page and then the
way it works is that it will try then to

00:12:47.879 --> 00:12:47.889
way it works is that it will try then to
 

00:12:47.889 --> 00:12:51.809
way it works is that it will try then to
get assets on the page from local peers

00:12:51.809 --> 00:12:51.819
get assets on the page from local peers
 

00:12:51.819 --> 00:12:54.960
get assets on the page from local peers
rather than defaulting to downloading

00:12:54.960 --> 00:12:54.970
rather than defaulting to downloading
 

00:12:54.970 --> 00:12:58.170
rather than defaulting to downloading
them from the server so yeah it's a kind

00:12:58.170 --> 00:12:58.180
them from the server so yeah it's a kind
 

00:12:58.180 --> 00:12:59.939
them from the server so yeah it's a kind
of prototype but you know it's this kind

00:12:59.939 --> 00:12:59.949
of prototype but you know it's this kind
 

00:12:59.949 --> 00:13:02.850
of prototype but you know it's this kind
of vision for a really different way of

00:13:02.850 --> 00:13:02.860
of vision for a really different way of
 

00:13:02.860 --> 00:13:06.720
of vision for a really different way of
doing things on the web so I kind of

00:13:06.720 --> 00:13:06.730
doing things on the web so I kind of
 

00:13:06.730 --> 00:13:09.540
doing things on the web so I kind of
skipped over getusermedia I just wanted

00:13:09.540 --> 00:13:09.550
skipped over getusermedia I just wanted
 

00:13:09.550 --> 00:13:11.670
skipped over getusermedia I just wanted
to sort of go into that little bit more

00:13:11.670 --> 00:13:11.680
to sort of go into that little bit more
 

00:13:11.680 --> 00:13:14.579
to sort of go into that little bit more
detail getusermedia is pretty

00:13:14.579 --> 00:13:14.589
detail getusermedia is pretty
 

00:13:14.589 --> 00:13:17.309
detail getusermedia is pretty
straightforward you can see here I mean

00:13:17.309 --> 00:13:17.319
straightforward you can see here I mean
 

00:13:17.319 --> 00:13:19.439
straightforward you can see here I mean
you call get user who gives a meter on

00:13:19.439 --> 00:13:19.449
you call get user who gives a meter on
 

00:13:19.449 --> 00:13:19.800
you call get user who gives a meter on
the

00:13:19.800 --> 00:13:19.810
the
 

00:13:19.810 --> 00:13:22.650
the
navigator object and you pass it a

00:13:22.650 --> 00:13:22.660
navigator object and you pass it a
 

00:13:22.660 --> 00:13:25.410
navigator object and you pass it a
constraints object this is actually

00:13:25.410 --> 00:13:25.420
constraints object this is actually
 

00:13:25.420 --> 00:13:27.480
constraints object this is actually
really powerful this is defining what

00:13:27.480 --> 00:13:27.490
really powerful this is defining what
 

00:13:27.490 --> 00:13:29.130
really powerful this is defining what
kind of media we want in this example

00:13:29.130 --> 00:13:29.140
kind of media we want in this example
 

00:13:29.140 --> 00:13:30.930
kind of media we want in this example
all I'm saying is give me video you know

00:13:30.930 --> 00:13:30.940
all I'm saying is give me video you know
 

00:13:30.940 --> 00:13:32.850
all I'm saying is give me video you know
just give me the default video and then

00:13:32.850 --> 00:13:32.860
just give me the default video and then
 

00:13:32.860 --> 00:13:36.000
just give me the default video and then
the success callback is is passed a

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:36.010
the success callback is is passed a
 

00:13:36.010 --> 00:13:38.550
the success callback is is passed a
stream which then you can do what you

00:13:38.550 --> 00:13:38.560
stream which then you can do what you
 

00:13:38.560 --> 00:13:41.010
stream which then you can do what you
want with let's see that in action in

00:13:41.010 --> 00:13:41.020
want with let's see that in action in
 

00:13:41.020 --> 00:13:45.120
want with let's see that in action in
fact so yeah I'm going to page this

00:13:45.120 --> 00:13:45.130
fact so yeah I'm going to page this
 

00:13:45.130 --> 00:13:47.220
fact so yeah I'm going to page this
calling getusermedia notice that I have

00:13:47.220 --> 00:13:47.230
calling getusermedia notice that I have
 

00:13:47.230 --> 00:13:51.150
calling getusermedia notice that I have
to explicitly allow access to my camera

00:13:51.150 --> 00:13:51.160
to explicitly allow access to my camera
 

00:13:51.160 --> 00:13:54.300
to explicitly allow access to my camera
there and then bang we're getting video

00:13:54.300 --> 00:13:54.310
there and then bang we're getting video
 

00:13:54.310 --> 00:13:57.300
there and then bang we're getting video
from the I've got a USB camera plugged

00:13:57.300 --> 00:13:57.310
from the I've got a USB camera plugged
 

00:13:57.310 --> 00:14:02.810
from the I've got a USB camera plugged
in there you can see so hello everyone

00:14:02.810 --> 00:14:02.820
 
 

00:14:02.820 --> 00:14:05.340
 
what's nice about this though is when

00:14:05.340 --> 00:14:05.350
what's nice about this though is when
 

00:14:05.350 --> 00:14:06.660
what's nice about this though is when
you see these I don't know you know

00:14:06.660 --> 00:14:06.670
you see these I don't know you know
 

00:14:06.670 --> 00:14:08.010
you see these I don't know you know
these api is coming up against each

00:14:08.010 --> 00:14:08.020
these api is coming up against each
 

00:14:08.020 --> 00:14:11.190
these api is coming up against each
other so in this example we're getting

00:14:11.190 --> 00:14:11.200
other so in this example we're getting
 

00:14:11.200 --> 00:14:14.340
other so in this example we're getting
video from the camera and we turn around

00:14:14.340 --> 00:14:14.350
video from the camera and we turn around
 

00:14:14.350 --> 00:14:15.329
video from the camera and we turn around
this way and you can actually see

00:14:15.329 --> 00:14:15.339
this way and you can actually see
 

00:14:15.339 --> 00:14:17.250
this way and you can actually see
something what's happening is we're

00:14:17.250 --> 00:14:17.260
something what's happening is we're
 

00:14:17.260 --> 00:14:18.990
something what's happening is we're
getting frame grabs from the camera

00:14:18.990 --> 00:14:19.000
getting frame grabs from the camera
 

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:21.930
getting frame grabs from the camera
plumbing those into a canvas element and

00:14:21.930 --> 00:14:21.940
plumbing those into a canvas element and
 

00:14:21.940 --> 00:14:25.200
plumbing those into a canvas element and
then analyzing that canvas element pixel

00:14:25.200 --> 00:14:25.210
then analyzing that canvas element pixel
 

00:14:25.210 --> 00:14:29.070
then analyzing that canvas element pixel
by pixel to give us ascii art which is

00:14:29.070 --> 00:14:29.080
by pixel to give us ascii art which is
 

00:14:29.080 --> 00:14:31.020
by pixel to give us ascii art which is
it's just nice when these you know these

00:14:31.020 --> 00:14:31.030
it's just nice when these you know these
 

00:14:31.030 --> 00:14:33.980
it's just nice when these you know these
these a POS can interact like this

00:14:33.980 --> 00:14:33.990
these a POS can interact like this
 

00:14:33.990 --> 00:14:37.290
these a POS can interact like this
thinking about working with constraints

00:14:37.290 --> 00:14:37.300
thinking about working with constraints
 

00:14:37.300 --> 00:14:39.750
thinking about working with constraints
we can also use constraints to select

00:14:39.750 --> 00:14:39.760
we can also use constraints to select
 

00:14:39.760 --> 00:14:44.040
we can also use constraints to select
the resolution of our camera so wow

00:14:44.040 --> 00:14:44.050
the resolution of our camera so wow
 

00:14:44.050 --> 00:14:48.810
the resolution of our camera so wow
that's slow if we if we go to this web

00:14:48.810 --> 00:14:48.820
that's slow if we if we go to this web
 

00:14:48.820 --> 00:14:53.190
that's slow if we if we go to this web
page there we go in fact let's look at

00:14:53.190 --> 00:14:53.200
page there we go in fact let's look at
 

00:14:53.200 --> 00:14:55.410
page there we go in fact let's look at
the source for this on github if that'll

00:14:55.410 --> 00:14:55.420
the source for this on github if that'll
 

00:14:55.420 --> 00:14:58.440
the source for this on github if that'll
open you'll see if you can see how this

00:14:58.440 --> 00:14:58.450
open you'll see if you can see how this
 

00:14:58.450 --> 00:15:00.440
open you'll see if you can see how this
bump up the size a little bit we've got

00:15:00.440 --> 00:15:00.450
bump up the size a little bit we've got
 

00:15:00.450 --> 00:15:03.000
bump up the size a little bit we've got
three different constraints objects

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:03.010
three different constraints objects
 

00:15:03.010 --> 00:15:05.100
three different constraints objects
these like each represents a kind of low

00:15:05.100 --> 00:15:05.110
these like each represents a kind of low
 

00:15:05.110 --> 00:15:07.860
these like each represents a kind of low
medium and high res so to speak so when

00:15:07.860 --> 00:15:07.870
medium and high res so to speak so when
 

00:15:07.870 --> 00:15:10.620
medium and high res so to speak so when
we click the button here we're getting

00:15:10.620 --> 00:15:10.630
we click the button here we're getting
 

00:15:10.630 --> 00:15:14.550
we click the button here we're getting
640 x 360 right up to HD here which is

00:15:14.550 --> 00:15:14.560
640 x 360 right up to HD here which is
 

00:15:14.560 --> 00:15:16.440
640 x 360 right up to HD here which is
our sorry I've still got the other one

00:15:16.440 --> 00:15:16.450
our sorry I've still got the other one
 

00:15:16.450 --> 00:15:19.620
our sorry I've still got the other one
open here so let me just close that and

00:15:19.620 --> 00:15:19.630
open here so let me just close that and
 

00:15:19.630 --> 00:15:21.890
open here so let me just close that and
then

00:15:21.890 --> 00:15:21.900
then
 

00:15:21.900 --> 00:15:24.740
then
to pull that through again so basically

00:15:24.740 --> 00:15:24.750
to pull that through again so basically
 

00:15:24.750 --> 00:15:27.080
to pull that through again so basically
we've got the ability to to choose

00:15:27.080 --> 00:15:27.090
we've got the ability to to choose
 

00:15:27.090 --> 00:15:29.150
we've got the ability to to choose
resolutions there we get you can see I'm

00:15:29.150 --> 00:15:29.160
resolutions there we get you can see I'm
 

00:15:29.160 --> 00:15:34.310
resolutions there we get you can see I'm
getting the full HD from hello wave to

00:15:34.310 --> 00:15:34.320
getting the full HD from hello wave to
 

00:15:34.320 --> 00:15:36.770
getting the full HD from hello wave to
the camera yeah this is kind of crucial

00:15:36.770 --> 00:15:36.780
the camera yeah this is kind of crucial
 

00:15:36.780 --> 00:15:38.740
the camera yeah this is kind of crucial
of course also when we're thinking about

00:15:38.740 --> 00:15:38.750
of course also when we're thinking about
 

00:15:38.750 --> 00:15:41.390
of course also when we're thinking about
getting you know getting media from a

00:15:41.390 --> 00:15:41.400
getting you know getting media from a
 

00:15:41.400 --> 00:15:44.810
getting you know getting media from a
mobile device and and making sure that

00:15:44.810 --> 00:15:44.820
mobile device and and making sure that
 

00:15:44.820 --> 00:15:47.540
mobile device and and making sure that
you know we're not overdoing it in terms

00:15:47.540 --> 00:15:47.550
you know we're not overdoing it in terms
 

00:15:47.550 --> 00:15:50.030
you know we're not overdoing it in terms
of bandwidth um we can also use

00:15:50.030 --> 00:15:50.040
of bandwidth um we can also use
 

00:15:50.040 --> 00:15:53.140
of bandwidth um we can also use
constraints to select camera sources so

00:15:53.140 --> 00:15:53.150
constraints to select camera sources so
 

00:15:53.150 --> 00:15:57.860
constraints to select camera sources so
let's do that now I'm going to go for

00:15:57.860 --> 00:15:57.870
let's do that now I'm going to go for
 

00:15:57.870 --> 00:16:02.840
let's do that now I'm going to go for
this on on the device here let's in fact

00:16:02.840 --> 00:16:02.850
this on on the device here let's in fact
 

00:16:02.850 --> 00:16:05.930
this on on the device here let's in fact
let's show it on mobile device i think i

00:16:05.930 --> 00:16:05.940
let's show it on mobile device i think i
 

00:16:05.940 --> 00:16:09.950
let's show it on mobile device i think i
can actually if we look at over here i

00:16:09.950 --> 00:16:09.960
can actually if we look at over here i
 

00:16:09.960 --> 00:16:11.600
can actually if we look at over here i
would share to you okay sure so

00:16:11.600 --> 00:16:11.610
would share to you okay sure so
 

00:16:11.610 --> 00:16:14.900
would share to you okay sure so
basically we can get the ID for the

00:16:14.900 --> 00:16:14.910
basically we can get the ID for the
 

00:16:14.910 --> 00:16:17.180
basically we can get the ID for the
different devices attached to the

00:16:17.180 --> 00:16:17.190
different devices attached to the
 

00:16:17.190 --> 00:16:19.720
different devices attached to the
machine and then we can select different

00:16:19.720 --> 00:16:19.730
machine and then we can select different
 

00:16:19.730 --> 00:16:22.880
machine and then we can select different
cameras depending which we want and as

00:16:22.880 --> 00:16:22.890
cameras depending which we want and as
 

00:16:22.890 --> 00:16:26.530
cameras depending which we want and as
you can imagine this is kind of bizarre

00:16:26.530 --> 00:16:26.540
you can imagine this is kind of bizarre
 

00:16:26.540 --> 00:16:30.590
you can imagine this is kind of bizarre
weird yeah we this is crucial again for

00:16:30.590 --> 00:16:30.600
weird yeah we this is crucial again for
 

00:16:30.600 --> 00:16:32.810
weird yeah we this is crucial again for
you know devices that like phones and

00:16:32.810 --> 00:16:32.820
you know devices that like phones and
 

00:16:32.820 --> 00:16:34.940
you know devices that like phones and
slates where we obviously want to be

00:16:34.940 --> 00:16:34.950
slates where we obviously want to be
 

00:16:34.950 --> 00:16:36.920
slates where we obviously want to be
able to do selfie mode or kind of crowd

00:16:36.920 --> 00:16:36.930
able to do selfie mode or kind of crowd
 

00:16:36.930 --> 00:16:41.060
able to do selfie mode or kind of crowd
made so there we go yeah okay that's

00:16:41.060 --> 00:16:41.070
made so there we go yeah okay that's
 

00:16:41.070 --> 00:16:44.240
made so there we go yeah okay that's
right just remember for a selfie selfie

00:16:44.240 --> 00:16:44.250
right just remember for a selfie selfie
 

00:16:44.250 --> 00:16:48.710
right just remember for a selfie selfie
is good and again this is all done with

00:16:48.710 --> 00:16:48.720
is good and again this is all done with
 

00:16:48.720 --> 00:16:51.680
is good and again this is all done with
constraints same with with screen

00:16:51.680 --> 00:16:51.690
constraints same with with screen
 

00:16:51.690 --> 00:16:53.810
constraints same with with screen
capture we can do the do the same thing

00:16:53.810 --> 00:16:53.820
capture we can do the do the same thing
 

00:16:53.820 --> 00:16:58.490
capture we can do the do the same thing
so i'll just go out of full screen mode

00:16:58.490 --> 00:16:58.500
so i'll just go out of full screen mode
 

00:16:58.500 --> 00:17:00.680
so i'll just go out of full screen mode
so we've specified in the constraints

00:17:00.680 --> 00:17:00.690
so we've specified in the constraints
 

00:17:00.690 --> 00:17:02.770
so we've specified in the constraints
that we actually want to get video from

00:17:02.770 --> 00:17:02.780
that we actually want to get video from
 

00:17:02.780 --> 00:17:05.000
that we actually want to get video from
screen capture which you know it's

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:05.010
screen capture which you know it's
 

00:17:05.010 --> 00:17:06.500
screen capture which you know it's
slightly ridiculous because we're

00:17:06.500 --> 00:17:06.510
slightly ridiculous because we're
 

00:17:06.510 --> 00:17:08.240
slightly ridiculous because we're
getting a screencast of a screencast but

00:17:08.240 --> 00:17:08.250
getting a screencast of a screencast but
 

00:17:08.250 --> 00:17:09.949
getting a screencast of a screencast but
anyway you can you can imagine there are

00:17:09.949 --> 00:17:09.959
anyway you can you can imagine there are
 

00:17:09.959 --> 00:17:13.850
anyway you can you can imagine there are
lots of lots of kind of good use cases

00:17:13.850 --> 00:17:13.860
lots of lots of kind of good use cases
 

00:17:13.860 --> 00:17:18.440
lots of lots of kind of good use cases
for that people ask about recording we

00:17:18.440 --> 00:17:18.450
for that people ask about recording we
 

00:17:18.450 --> 00:17:21.050
for that people ask about recording we
have an API for this coming through

00:17:21.050 --> 00:17:21.060
have an API for this coming through
 

00:17:21.060 --> 00:17:23.570
have an API for this coming through
being specified and implemented media

00:17:23.570 --> 00:17:23.580
being specified and implemented media
 

00:17:23.580 --> 00:17:25.310
being specified and implemented media
stream recording for recording audio and

00:17:25.310 --> 00:17:25.320
stream recording for recording audio and
 

00:17:25.320 --> 00:17:29.090
stream recording for recording audio and
video there's also the the media stream

00:17:29.090 --> 00:17:29.100
video there's also the the media stream
 

00:17:29.100 --> 00:17:31.420
video there's also the the media stream
cab image capture API which is kind of a

00:17:31.420 --> 00:17:31.430
cab image capture API which is kind of a
 

00:17:31.430 --> 00:17:35.030
cab image capture API which is kind of a
taking photos API you know you can do

00:17:35.030 --> 00:17:35.040
taking photos API you know you can do
 

00:17:35.040 --> 00:17:35.570
taking photos API you know you can do
that with

00:17:35.570 --> 00:17:35.580
that with
 

00:17:35.580 --> 00:17:37.850
that with
use a media in canvas but this gives us

00:17:37.850 --> 00:17:37.860
use a media in canvas but this gives us
 

00:17:37.860 --> 00:17:40.100
use a media in canvas but this gives us
access well is proposed to give access

00:17:40.100 --> 00:17:40.110
access well is proposed to give access
 

00:17:40.110 --> 00:17:43.040
access well is proposed to give access
to stuff like camera auto focus and zoom

00:17:43.040 --> 00:17:43.050
to stuff like camera auto focus and zoom
 

00:17:43.050 --> 00:17:45.200
to stuff like camera auto focus and zoom
and so on so I think that'll be great

00:17:45.200 --> 00:17:45.210
and so on so I think that'll be great
 

00:17:45.210 --> 00:17:47.600
and so on so I think that'll be great
again you know really good for mobile

00:17:47.600 --> 00:17:47.610
again you know really good for mobile
 

00:17:47.610 --> 00:17:51.890
again you know really good for mobile
devices so there's a lot about video

00:17:51.890 --> 00:17:51.900
devices so there's a lot about video
 

00:17:51.900 --> 00:17:54.170
devices so there's a lot about video
yeah this one again could tell us a

00:17:54.170 --> 00:17:54.180
yeah this one again could tell us a
 

00:17:54.180 --> 00:17:56.240
yeah this one again could tell us a
little bit about the world of audio yeah

00:17:56.240 --> 00:17:56.250
little bit about the world of audio yeah
 

00:17:56.250 --> 00:17:57.680
little bit about the world of audio yeah
what's video with that audio that's

00:17:57.680 --> 00:17:57.690
what's video with that audio that's
 

00:17:57.690 --> 00:17:59.810
what's video with that audio that's
pretty much nothing isn't it so let's

00:17:59.810 --> 00:17:59.820
pretty much nothing isn't it so let's
 

00:17:59.820 --> 00:18:03.980
pretty much nothing isn't it so let's
focus on audio a little bit so we have a

00:18:03.980 --> 00:18:03.990
focus on audio a little bit so we have a
 

00:18:03.990 --> 00:18:05.600
focus on audio a little bit so we have a
great thing that's been around for quite

00:18:05.600 --> 00:18:05.610
great thing that's been around for quite
 

00:18:05.610 --> 00:18:08.930
great thing that's been around for quite
a while the audio tag well supported

00:18:08.930 --> 00:18:08.940
a while the audio tag well supported
 

00:18:08.940 --> 00:18:10.430
a while the audio tag well supported
very easy to use and it takes care of

00:18:10.430 --> 00:18:10.440
very easy to use and it takes care of
 

00:18:10.440 --> 00:18:13.730
very easy to use and it takes care of
everything loads decodes buffers and

00:18:13.730 --> 00:18:13.740
everything loads decodes buffers and
 

00:18:13.740 --> 00:18:16.400
everything loads decodes buffers and
plays out your your audio and even

00:18:16.400 --> 00:18:16.410
plays out your your audio and even
 

00:18:16.410 --> 00:18:18.380
plays out your your audio and even
include say a player's you don't have to

00:18:18.380 --> 00:18:18.390
include say a player's you don't have to
 

00:18:18.390 --> 00:18:19.730
include say a player's you don't have to
do anything more than that line and you

00:18:19.730 --> 00:18:19.740
do anything more than that line and you
 

00:18:19.740 --> 00:18:22.600
do anything more than that line and you
can play an audio file that's great but

00:18:22.600 --> 00:18:22.610
can play an audio file that's great but
 

00:18:22.610 --> 00:18:25.010
can play an audio file that's great but
there are applications where that is

00:18:25.010 --> 00:18:25.020
there are applications where that is
 

00:18:25.020 --> 00:18:28.400
there are applications where that is
just not enough for example precise

00:18:28.400 --> 00:18:28.410
just not enough for example precise
 

00:18:28.410 --> 00:18:31.280
just not enough for example precise
timing is super important in gaming and

00:18:31.280 --> 00:18:31.290
timing is super important in gaming and
 

00:18:31.290 --> 00:18:32.900
timing is super important in gaming and
being able to have many different sounds

00:18:32.900 --> 00:18:32.910
being able to have many different sounds
 

00:18:32.910 --> 00:18:35.630
being able to have many different sounds
at the same time in the music creation

00:18:35.630 --> 00:18:35.640
at the same time in the music creation
 

00:18:35.640 --> 00:18:38.090
at the same time in the music creation
etc so we came up with a Web Audio API

00:18:38.090 --> 00:18:38.100
etc so we came up with a Web Audio API
 

00:18:38.100 --> 00:18:41.780
etc so we came up with a Web Audio API
and the Web Audio API is really just a

00:18:41.780 --> 00:18:41.790
and the Web Audio API is really just a
 

00:18:41.790 --> 00:18:45.830
and the Web Audio API is really just a
it's a pro audio environment in the

00:18:45.830 --> 00:18:45.840
it's a pro audio environment in the
 

00:18:45.840 --> 00:18:49.430
it's a pro audio environment in the
browser and it involves a lot of stuff

00:18:49.430 --> 00:18:49.440
browser and it involves a lot of stuff
 

00:18:49.440 --> 00:18:52.210
browser and it involves a lot of stuff
so let's let's start with the just the

00:18:52.210 --> 00:18:52.220
so let's let's start with the just the
 

00:18:52.220 --> 00:18:55.280
so let's let's start with the just the
look at what you can do for as I said

00:18:55.280 --> 00:18:55.290
look at what you can do for as I said
 

00:18:55.290 --> 00:18:57.380
look at what you can do for as I said
you can timing but you can also do cool

00:18:57.380 --> 00:18:57.390
you can timing but you can also do cool
 

00:18:57.390 --> 00:19:00.860
you can timing but you can also do cool
things like create audio so here is just

00:19:00.860 --> 00:19:00.870
things like create audio so here is just
 

00:19:00.870 --> 00:19:02.890
things like create audio so here is just
a semester

00:19:02.890 --> 00:19:02.900
a semester
 

00:19:02.900 --> 00:19:06.100
a semester
and all this through audio is created by

00:19:06.100 --> 00:19:06.110
and all this through audio is created by
 

00:19:06.110 --> 00:19:09.790
and all this through audio is created by
Web Audio and with all the controls you

00:19:09.790 --> 00:19:09.800
Web Audio and with all the controls you
 

00:19:09.800 --> 00:19:12.220
Web Audio and with all the controls you
can switch things on with perfect timing

00:19:12.220 --> 00:19:12.230
can switch things on with perfect timing
 

00:19:12.230 --> 00:19:15.910
can switch things on with perfect timing
at any time you want and some of the

00:19:15.910 --> 00:19:15.920
at any time you want and some of the
 

00:19:15.920 --> 00:19:19.990
at any time you want and some of the
things you go

00:19:19.990 --> 00:19:20.000
things you go
 

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:22.479
things you go
run away

00:19:22.479 --> 00:19:22.489
run away
 

00:19:22.489 --> 00:19:27.619
run away
I'm not going to stay up all right so

00:19:27.619 --> 00:19:27.629
I'm not going to stay up all right so
 

00:19:27.629 --> 00:19:29.330
I'm not going to stay up all right so
Web Audio can do that so we just saw an

00:19:29.330 --> 00:19:29.340
Web Audio can do that so we just saw an
 

00:19:29.340 --> 00:19:32.989
Web Audio can do that so we just saw an
example of creating audio we can do

00:19:32.989 --> 00:19:32.999
example of creating audio we can do
 

00:19:32.999 --> 00:19:35.119
example of creating audio we can do
timing we can also analyze all your data

00:19:35.119 --> 00:19:35.129
timing we can also analyze all your data
 

00:19:35.129 --> 00:19:40.090
timing we can also analyze all your data
super nice applications are for example

00:19:40.090 --> 00:19:40.100
super nice applications are for example
 

00:19:40.100 --> 00:19:43.399
super nice applications are for example
visualizers and things and even if you

00:19:43.399 --> 00:19:43.409
visualizers and things and even if you
 

00:19:43.409 --> 00:19:46.009
visualizers and things and even if you
still want that all that long file you

00:19:46.009 --> 00:19:46.019
still want that all that long file you
 

00:19:46.019 --> 00:19:47.359
still want that all that long file you
want to download with the audio tag then

00:19:47.359 --> 00:19:47.369
want to download with the audio tag then
 

00:19:47.369 --> 00:19:48.830
want to download with the audio tag then
you can just plumb that into Web Audio

00:19:48.830 --> 00:19:48.840
you can just plumb that into Web Audio
 

00:19:48.840 --> 00:19:51.310
you can just plumb that into Web Audio
and you get the ability to add

00:19:51.310 --> 00:19:51.320
and you get the ability to add
 

00:19:51.320 --> 00:19:53.570
and you get the ability to add
visualizes effects it's that on top of

00:19:53.570 --> 00:19:53.580
visualizes effects it's that on top of
 

00:19:53.580 --> 00:19:57.200
visualizes effects it's that on top of
that so audio tagging and the can come

00:19:57.200 --> 00:19:57.210
that so audio tagging and the can come
 

00:19:57.210 --> 00:20:00.310
that so audio tagging and the can come
as a way of loading audio into Web Audio

00:20:00.310 --> 00:20:00.320
as a way of loading audio into Web Audio
 

00:20:00.320 --> 00:20:02.539
as a way of loading audio into Web Audio
so I'm not going to go into all the

00:20:02.539 --> 00:20:02.549
so I'm not going to go into all the
 

00:20:02.549 --> 00:20:04.460
so I'm not going to go into all the
details about Web Audio it's just such a

00:20:04.460 --> 00:20:04.470
details about Web Audio it's just such a
 

00:20:04.470 --> 00:20:06.289
details about Web Audio it's just such a
powerful tool and what's really nice all

00:20:06.289 --> 00:20:06.299
powerful tool and what's really nice all
 

00:20:06.299 --> 00:20:08.589
powerful tool and what's really nice all
these things are implemented in in

00:20:08.589 --> 00:20:08.599
these things are implemented in in
 

00:20:08.599 --> 00:20:11.539
these things are implemented in in
native code in the browser so you don't

00:20:11.539 --> 00:20:11.549
native code in the browser so you don't
 

00:20:11.549 --> 00:20:13.460
native code in the browser so you don't
have to do this in in javascript in

00:20:13.460 --> 00:20:13.470
have to do this in in javascript in
 

00:20:13.470 --> 00:20:15.759
have to do this in in javascript in
JavaScript you have a nice node based

00:20:15.759 --> 00:20:15.769
JavaScript you have a nice node based
 

00:20:15.769 --> 00:20:17.989
JavaScript you have a nice node based
pipeline where you just plug in things

00:20:17.989 --> 00:20:17.999
pipeline where you just plug in things
 

00:20:17.999 --> 00:20:22.009
pipeline where you just plug in things
and easily put it together but it's

00:20:22.009 --> 00:20:22.019
and easily put it together but it's
 

00:20:22.019 --> 00:20:24.409
and easily put it together but it's
really Pro Audio so for example a good

00:20:24.409 --> 00:20:24.419
really Pro Audio so for example a good
 

00:20:24.419 --> 00:20:27.409
really Pro Audio so for example a good
example is that we can have input to

00:20:27.409 --> 00:20:27.419

getusermedia that Sam talked about and
showed video examples but you can

00:21:26.479 --> 00:21:26.489
showed video examples but you can
 

00:21:26.489 --> 00:21:27.859
showed video examples but you can
obviously use that to hook up your

00:21:27.859 --> 00:21:27.869
obviously use that to hook up your
 

00:21:27.869 --> 00:21:30.889
obviously use that to hook up your
microphone and get an audio stream and

you can do is you can plug it in as a
 

00:21:35.370 --> 00:21:37.670
you can do is you can plug it in as a
source in web audio so you get a

00:21:37.670 --> 00:21:37.680
source in web audio so you get a
 

00:21:37.680 --> 00:21:40.580
source in web audio so you get a
microphone input that's the source in

00:21:40.580 --> 00:21:40.590
microphone input that's the source in
 

00:21:40.590 --> 00:21:42.230
microphone input that's the source in

that comes into Web Audio you can apply
filters and effects and then you play it

00:21:54.020 --> 00:21:54.030
filters and effects and then you play it
 

00:21:54.030 --> 00:21:56.090
filters and effects and then you play it
out 5 milliseconds later so basically

00:21:56.090 --> 00:21:56.100
out 5 milliseconds later so basically
 

00:21:56.100 --> 00:21:59.650

free video codecs so we had developed BP

00:25:36.020 --> 00:25:36.030
free video codecs so we had developed BP
 

00:25:36.030 --> 00:25:38.299
free video codecs so we had developed BP
8 and that's been out for for several

00:25:38.299 --> 00:25:38.309
8 and that's been out for for several
 

00:25:38.309 --> 00:25:40.280
8 and that's been out for for several
years that really address what you need

00:25:40.280 --> 00:25:40.290
years that really address what you need
 

00:25:40.290 --> 00:25:42.530
years that really address what you need
today but we didn't stop there now we

00:25:42.530 --> 00:25:42.540
today but we didn't stop there now we
 

00:25:42.540 --> 00:25:44.510
today but we didn't stop there now we
also have vp9 which is the next

00:25:44.510 --> 00:25:44.520
also have vp9 which is the next
 

00:25:44.520 --> 00:25:47.320
also have vp9 which is the next
generation that saves more bits at a bit

00:25:47.320 --> 00:25:47.330
generation that saves more bits at a bit
 

00:25:47.330 --> 00:25:49.700
generation that saves more bits at a bit
at a really good qualities you can look

00:25:49.700 --> 00:25:49.710
at a really good qualities you can look
 

00:25:49.710 --> 00:25:51.290
at a really good qualities you can look
here at the bars in the middle so we

00:25:51.290 --> 00:25:51.300
here at the bars in the middle so we
 

00:25:51.300 --> 00:25:54.650
here at the bars in the middle so we
compared h.264 and vp9 you can see the

00:25:54.650 --> 00:25:54.660
compared h.264 and vp9 you can see the
 

00:25:54.660 --> 00:25:56.630
compared h.264 and vp9 you can see the
bar is the bit rate how much we save all

00:25:56.630 --> 00:25:56.640
bar is the bit rate how much we save all
 

00:25:56.640 --> 00:25:58.669
bar is the bit rate how much we save all
the time for the same quality this was

00:25:58.669 --> 00:25:58.679
the time for the same quality this was
 

00:25:58.679 --> 00:26:02.210
the time for the same quality this was
from google i/o so really a great job

00:26:02.210 --> 00:26:02.220
from google i/o so really a great job
 

00:26:02.220 --> 00:26:03.650
from google i/o so really a great job

00:26:47.630 --> 00:26:47.640
if any we got a little bit extra so yeah
 

00:26:47.640 --> 00:26:48.860
if any we got a little bit extra so yeah
we've got a great support for audio and

00:26:48.860 --> 00:26:48.870
we've got a great support for audio and
 

00:26:48.870 --> 00:26:51.860
we've got a great support for audio and
video range of platforms also thinking

00:26:51.860 --> 00:26:51.870
video range of platforms also thinking
 

00:26:51.870 --> 00:26:54.259
video range of platforms also thinking
about like captions and subtitles and

00:26:54.259 --> 00:26:54.269
about like captions and subtitles and
 

00:26:54.269 --> 00:26:56.959
about like captions and subtitles and
accessibility and we got great support

00:26:56.959 --> 00:26:56.969
accessibility and we got great support
 

00:26:56.969 --> 00:26:59.690
accessibility and we got great support
for this as well just looking I don't if

00:26:59.690 --> 00:26:59.700
for this as well just looking I don't if
 

00:26:59.700 --> 00:27:01.940
for this as well just looking I don't if
people have seen the track element this

00:27:01.940 --> 00:27:01.950
people have seen the track element this
 

00:27:01.950 --> 00:27:05.149
people have seen the track element this
is kind of a simple simple way of adding

00:27:05.149 --> 00:27:05.159
is kind of a simple simple way of adding
 

00:27:05.159 --> 00:27:08.810
is kind of a simple simple way of adding
subtitles or captions to to your

00:27:08.810 --> 00:27:08.820
subtitles or captions to to your
 

00:27:08.820 --> 00:27:13.310
subtitles or captions to to your
applications chug chug chug okay their

web is always changing yeah and you can

00:27:15.949 --> 00:27:15.959
web is always changing yeah and you can
 

00:27:15.959 --> 00:27:18.310
web is always changing yeah and you can
see there that you know we've got track

00:27:18.310 --> 00:27:18.320
see there that you know we've got track
 

00:27:18.320 --> 00:27:20.449
see there that you know we've got track
subtitles rendered over the video and

00:27:20.449 --> 00:27:20.459
subtitles rendered over the video and
 

00:27:20.459 --> 00:27:21.469
subtitles rendered over the video and
then I'm listening out for the cue

00:27:21.469 --> 00:27:21.479
then I'm listening out for the cue
 

00:27:21.479 --> 00:27:24.619
then I'm listening out for the cue
change events and then you know plugging

00:27:24.619 --> 00:27:24.629
change events and then you know plugging
 

00:27:24.629 --> 00:27:27.319
change events and then you know plugging
that stuff in a div there so just a

00:27:27.319 --> 00:27:27.329
that stuff in a div there so just a
 

00:27:27.329 --> 00:27:29.509
that stuff in a div there so just a
really simple way to to make your video

00:27:29.509 --> 00:27:29.519
really simple way to to make your video
 

00:27:29.519 --> 00:27:32.119
really simple way to to make your video
more accessible and to add that stuff

00:27:32.119 --> 00:27:32.129
more accessible and to add that stuff
 

00:27:32.129 --> 00:27:34.279
more accessible and to add that stuff
the way you do it is that you add a

00:27:34.279 --> 00:27:34.289
the way you do it is that you add a
 

00:27:34.289 --> 00:27:36.560
the way you do it is that you add a
track element to as a child of the video

00:27:36.560 --> 00:27:36.570
track element to as a child of the video
 

00:27:36.570 --> 00:27:39.529
track element to as a child of the video
element and then you point that to a

00:27:39.529 --> 00:27:39.539
element and then you point that to a
 

00:27:39.539 --> 00:27:42.499
element and then you point that to a
file it looks like like this which is

00:27:42.499 --> 00:27:42.509
file it looks like like this which is
 

00:27:42.509 --> 00:27:44.239
file it looks like like this which is
just essentially some information about

00:27:44.239 --> 00:27:44.249
just essentially some information about
 

00:27:44.249 --> 00:27:47.569
just essentially some information about
timing and then the the text of in this

00:27:47.569 --> 00:27:47.579
timing and then the the text of in this
 

00:27:47.579 --> 00:27:50.409
timing and then the the text of in this
case the subtitles there's also some

00:27:50.409 --> 00:27:50.419
case the subtitles there's also some
 

00:27:50.419 --> 00:27:52.999
case the subtitles there's also some
some information about the way the

00:27:52.999 --> 00:27:53.009
some information about the way the
 

00:27:53.009 --> 00:27:54.469
some information about the way the
subtitle it's kind of hints about how

00:27:54.469 --> 00:27:54.479
subtitle it's kind of hints about how
 

00:27:54.479 --> 00:27:56.869
subtitle it's kind of hints about how
they might be rendered there this little

00:27:56.869 --> 00:27:56.879
they might be rendered there this little
 

00:27:56.879 --> 00:27:58.279
they might be rendered there this little
link down the bottom here actually I

00:27:58.279 --> 00:27:58.289
link down the bottom here actually I
 

00:27:58.289 --> 00:28:01.099
link down the bottom here actually I
think this is amazing now implemented in

00:28:01.099 --> 00:28:01.109
think this is amazing now implemented in
 

00:28:01.109 --> 00:28:03.019
think this is amazing now implemented in
chrome is the ability to do what's

00:28:03.019 --> 00:28:03.029
chrome is the ability to do what's
 

00:28:03.029 --> 00:28:05.209
chrome is the ability to do what's
called in band webvtt this gives us the

00:28:05.209 --> 00:28:05.219
called in band webvtt this gives us the
 

00:28:05.219 --> 00:28:07.819
called in band webvtt this gives us the
ability to bundle a track file with

00:28:07.819 --> 00:28:07.829
ability to bundle a track file with
 

00:28:07.829 --> 00:28:10.759
ability to bundle a track file with
video file in order to you know be able

00:28:10.759 --> 00:28:10.769
video file in order to you know be able
 

00:28:10.769 --> 00:28:13.459
video file in order to you know be able
to distribute 11 file that contains the

00:28:13.459 --> 00:28:13.469
to distribute 11 file that contains the
 

00:28:13.469 --> 00:28:18.529
to distribute 11 file that contains the
video and the okay the you know the

00:28:18.529 --> 00:28:18.539
video and the okay the you know the
 

00:28:18.539 --> 00:28:20.709
video and the okay the you know the
whole thing in one package in one file

00:28:20.709 --> 00:28:20.719
whole thing in one package in one file
 

00:28:20.719 --> 00:28:24.409
whole thing in one package in one file
so we run out of time here but I just

00:28:24.409 --> 00:28:24.419
so we run out of time here but I just
 

00:28:24.419 --> 00:28:27.829
so we run out of time here but I just
like to to go like just a one more demo

00:28:27.829 --> 00:28:27.839
like to to go like just a one more demo
 

00:28:27.839 --> 00:28:30.049
like to to go like just a one more demo
that I think that you know really for me

00:28:30.049 --> 00:28:30.059
that I think that you know really for me
 

00:28:30.059 --> 00:28:33.319
that I think that you know really for me
sums up how far we've come with audio

00:28:33.319 --> 00:28:33.329
sums up how far we've come with audio
 

00:28:33.329 --> 00:28:34.819
sums up how far we've come with audio
and video on the web and here you'll get

00:28:34.819 --> 00:28:34.829
and video on the web and here you'll get
 

00:28:34.829 --> 00:28:38.389
and video on the web and here you'll get
the real doubts yeah this slightly weird

00:28:38.389 --> 00:28:38.399
the real doubts yeah this slightly weird
 

00:28:38.399 --> 00:28:42.949
the real doubts yeah this slightly weird
video shows like what we got here is two

00:28:42.949 --> 00:28:42.959
video shows like what we got here is two
 

00:28:42.959 --> 00:28:45.169
video shows like what we got here is two
videos encoded with alpha transparency

00:28:45.169 --> 00:28:45.179
videos encoded with alpha transparency
 

00:28:45.179 --> 00:28:48.649
videos encoded with alpha transparency
information and you know these are just

00:28:48.649 --> 00:28:48.659
information and you know these are just
 

00:28:48.659 --> 00:28:52.549
information and you know these are just
video elements so that is weird so we

00:28:52.549 --> 00:28:52.559
video elements so that is weird so we
 

00:28:52.559 --> 00:28:54.199
video elements so that is weird so we
have the ability to do you know like CSS

00:28:54.199 --> 00:28:54.209
have the ability to do you know like CSS
 

00:28:54.209 --> 00:28:56.299
have the ability to do you know like CSS
filters these are just elements we can

00:28:56.299 --> 00:28:56.309
filters these are just elements we can
 

00:28:56.309 --> 00:28:57.589
filters these are just elements we can
double click on these and I've got a

00:28:57.589 --> 00:28:57.599
double click on these and I've got a
 

00:28:57.599 --> 00:29:01.430
double click on these and I've got a
little CSS animation double-click the

00:29:01.430 --> 00:29:01.440
little CSS animation double-click the
 

00:29:01.440 --> 00:29:02.959
little CSS animation double-click the
background you know we have a video

00:29:02.959 --> 00:29:02.969
background you know we have a video
 

00:29:02.969 --> 00:29:04.669
background you know we have a video
playing in the background so you know

00:29:04.669 --> 00:29:04.679
playing in the background so you know
 

00:29:04.679 --> 00:29:06.950
playing in the background so you know
actually these are like basic sort of

00:29:06.950 --> 00:29:06.960
actually these are like basic sort of
 

00:29:06.960 --> 00:29:08.000
actually these are like basic sort of
green screen video

00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:08.010
green screen video
 

00:29:08.010 --> 00:29:09.470
green screen video
but you know actually the rendering is

00:29:09.470 --> 00:29:09.480
but you know actually the rendering is
 

00:29:09.480 --> 00:29:13.580
but you know actually the rendering is
is really stunning so yeah I'm just that

00:29:13.580 --> 00:29:13.590
is really stunning so yeah I'm just that
 

00:29:13.590 --> 00:29:14.930
is really stunning so yeah I'm just that
I don't know really pleased to see that

00:29:14.930 --> 00:29:14.940
I don't know really pleased to see that
 

00:29:14.940 --> 00:29:18.320
I don't know really pleased to see that
stuff so yeah please we you know we

00:29:18.320 --> 00:29:18.330
stuff so yeah please we you know we

what whatever I makes of these api's

00:29:22.850 --> 00:29:22.860
what whatever I makes of these api's
 

00:29:22.860 --> 00:29:24.940
what whatever I makes of these api's
because i think they are a great feat of

00:29:24.940 --> 00:29:24.950
because i think they are a great feat of
 

00:29:24.950 --> 00:29:27.320
because i think they are a great feat of
engineering and incredibly powerful

00:29:27.320 --> 00:29:27.330
engineering and incredibly powerful
 

00:29:27.330 --> 00:29:28.730
engineering and incredibly powerful
