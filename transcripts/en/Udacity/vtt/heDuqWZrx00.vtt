00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:02.900
Now I want to highlight one more document that

00:00:02.900 --> 00:00:06.100
will help you design your final project. It's called

00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:08.830
the Project Rubric, and is also available in the

00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:11.980
instructor notes. If you had enrolled in the full course

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:15.730
experience, you should know that your Udacity coach will

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:19.360
use this document to evaluate your project. If you're taking

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:22.560
the free courseware, you should still read through this

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:26.560
document to figure out what makes a great final project.

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:29.910
So I invite you to read through the Project Rubric now, please

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:32.890
make sure to check this box after you've read through the Project Rubric.
