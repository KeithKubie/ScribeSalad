SPEAKER 1: Hello.

00:00:00.810 --> 00:00:01.800
I'm Timothy Jordan.

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:03.510
Today, I'm coming to
you from the YouTube

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:05.190

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:07.740

Worklet--

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:18.120

programmatically generate

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:22.200
an image whenever a CSS
property expects an image.

The inspector works in
IntelliJ and Android Studio,

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:43.560

understand why your application

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:45.630

single distribution

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:16.830
