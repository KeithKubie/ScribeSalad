Alright, so we've just seen,

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
especially in that last quiz, how to

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
evaluate an expression or a statement

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
in in an environment,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
but we've been assuming that the environment,

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
which I said is kind of like the world,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
comes pre-prepared, but what if we

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
want to build a new world?

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
What if we want to set the values of variables?

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
What if I want to determine what the current temperature is?

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
Here I've written 2 code snippets,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
1 in Python and 1 in JavaScript

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
that do the same thing, and both of them

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
extend or create an environment.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
They make a bigger, richer world that has

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
new bindings of values to variables.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
Here in Python, we assign the value zero

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
to the variable x, and then we're going to

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
print out x + 1, that'll be 1,

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
and over here in JavaScript, we use a

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:48.000
var statement to introduce the variable x and assign it the value zero,

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
and then we write out onto the web page x + 1,

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
which in an incredible surprise move will also be 1.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
We're going to want to handle

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
statements like these in our JavaScript

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
interpreter in order to build our web browser.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
So let's test our knowledge of assignment.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
statements with a brief quiz.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
So here I've written a fragment of Python code

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.000
that's going to print out results to the screen

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000
based on these 2 print statements in myfun.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
What I would like you to do is to determine

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
which of the following outputs

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
could actually be produced by this program

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
and try to work through it in your head,

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000
and this quiz is multiple, multiple choice.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000
Check each box that corresponds to a

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
string that could be printed out

00:01:30.000 --> 09:59:59.000
if you were to run this program in the Python interpreter.
