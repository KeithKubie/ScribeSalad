00:00:00.499 --> 00:00:02.725
Thrill Soda hired
a marketing company

00:00:02.725 --> 00:00:05.455
to help them promote their
brand against Yummy Cola.

00:00:05.455 --> 00:00:07.530
The company gathered
the following data

00:00:07.530 --> 00:00:10.650
about consumers'
preference of soda.

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:13.840
So they have, year by year,
percentage of respondents

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:17.810
who preferred Yummy Cola,
percentage of respondents who

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:19.730
preferred Thrill
Cola, and then these

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:21.350
are people who
had no preference.

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:26.310
So in 2006, 80% liked Yummy,
only 12% liked Thrill,

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:30.200
and 8% didn't like either one
or didn't have any preference.

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:31.790
And so actually
just from here you

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:34.010
see that many, many more
people liked Yummy Cola

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:36.360
than Thrill Cola, actually
every year over year.

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.310
So, Thrill Cola
definitely has something.

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:39.630
They have an uphill battle.

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:41.713
But then they said the
advertising company created

00:00:41.713 --> 00:00:44.640
the following two graphs
to promote Thrill Soda.

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.350
And so let's see what's
happening over here.

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:50.790
And let's think about whether
this is misleading or not.

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:55.060
So if we look at this graph
over here, in 2006, sure enough,

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:57.096
80% liked Yummy Cola.

00:00:57.096 --> 00:00:59.080
Then in 2007, 76%.

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:05.032
Then it keeps going to then
77%, then 73%, then 73% to 68%.

00:01:05.032 --> 00:01:07.016
So this is accurate data.

00:01:07.016 --> 00:01:10.984
It actually represents the data
that's given right over here.

00:01:10.984 --> 00:01:11.976
I'll do it in the same.

00:01:11.976 --> 00:01:14.456
It actually represents
this data very faithfully.

00:01:14.456 --> 00:01:16.936
Then right over here, if we
look at this chart, Percentage

00:01:16.936 --> 00:01:21.400
of People who Prefer Thrill
Soda, so over here in 2006, 12%

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:24.376
preferred Thrill Soda.

00:01:24.376 --> 00:01:26.856
2007, 19%.

00:01:26.856 --> 00:01:29.336
2008, 19%.

00:01:29.336 --> 00:01:32.312
Then we go up to
20%, 21%, and 25%.

00:01:32.312 --> 00:01:34.296
So the graphs are
actually accurate.

00:01:34.296 --> 00:01:35.288
They're not lying.

00:01:35.288 --> 00:01:37.070
These are actually
the data points

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:39.302
of the percentage who
prefer Thrill Soda.

00:01:39.302 --> 00:01:41.286
Now what's misleading
is if someone

00:01:41.286 --> 00:01:43.270
were to just look
at these two graphs

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:45.750
without actually looking
at the scales over here,

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:47.677
they'll see two things.

00:01:47.677 --> 00:01:49.718
They'll say, oh, look,
you see a declining trend.

00:01:49.718 --> 00:01:52.694
And that's what line graphs are
good for, for seeing trends.

00:01:52.694 --> 00:01:54.678
They say, look, I
see a declining trend

00:01:54.678 --> 00:01:58.150
in the percentage of people
who prefer Yummy Cola.

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:01.622
And I see this increasing
trend in the percentage

00:02:01.622 --> 00:02:03.436
of people who
prefer Thrill Cola.

00:02:03.436 --> 00:02:04.102
And that's true.

00:02:04.102 --> 00:02:05.435
You have a declining trend here.

00:02:05.435 --> 00:02:07.078
And you have an
increasing trend here.

00:02:07.078 --> 00:02:09.062
But what's misleading
here is the way

00:02:09.062 --> 00:02:10.550
that they've plotted the scales.

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:13.030
These scales are not the same.

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:15.070
So when you look at
this, you say not only

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:18.046
is there an increasing trend of
people who prefer Thrill Soda,

00:02:18.046 --> 00:02:20.030
but the way they
set up the scale,

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:22.510
it looks like the
trend is above.

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:25.486
The human brain is
tempted to compare these

00:02:25.486 --> 00:02:27.966
and to say, look, not only
is this an upward trend,

00:02:27.966 --> 00:02:30.446
but it's above this
trend right over here.

00:02:30.446 --> 00:02:32.182
Even in 2006, this
data point looks

00:02:32.182 --> 00:02:35.406
higher than these data
points right over here.

00:02:35.406 --> 00:02:37.142
But the reality
is that it's only

00:02:37.142 --> 00:02:38.878
because the scale is distorted.

00:02:38.878 --> 00:02:40.862
Now this is the oldest
trick in the book

00:02:40.862 --> 00:02:42.350
when plotting line graphs.

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:43.838
It all depends on the scale.

00:02:43.838 --> 00:02:46.814
So this just looks good because
they used this scale that

00:02:46.814 --> 00:02:49.294
went from 0 to 30 as
opposed to 0 to 100.

00:02:49.294 --> 00:02:54.159
The better thing to do, or
the more genuine thing to do,

00:02:54.159 --> 00:02:56.284
or the more honest thing
to do, would have actually

00:02:56.284 --> 00:02:57.276
been to plot them
on the same graph.

00:02:57.276 --> 00:02:58.268
Although if they did
that, that wouldn't

00:02:58.268 --> 00:03:00.748
have painted a very good
picture for Thrill Soda.

00:03:00.748 --> 00:03:03.228
So if we plotted on the
same graph Thrill Soda,

00:03:03.228 --> 00:03:04.716
let's try that out.

00:03:04.716 --> 00:03:06.438
And actually, this
is even worse.

00:03:06.438 --> 00:03:08.188
You actually wouldn't
even be able to plot

00:03:08.188 --> 00:03:10.668
Thrill Soda on this graph
because they started this graph

00:03:10.668 --> 00:03:12.156
right over here at 50%.

00:03:12.156 --> 00:03:13.644
They didn't even start it at 0%.

00:03:13.644 --> 00:03:15.132
So you actually
would not even be

00:03:15.132 --> 00:03:17.116
able to plot Thrill
Soda on this graph.

00:03:17.116 --> 00:03:19.880
If you did, you would
have to extend this graph

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:20.588
all the way down.

00:03:20.588 --> 00:03:23.812
So you would have to extend
this graph all the way down

00:03:23.812 --> 00:03:26.540
to-- so this would
have to be 40%.

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:28.028
This would be 30%.

00:03:28.028 --> 00:03:30.012
This would be 20%.

00:03:30.012 --> 00:03:33.530
This would be 10%.

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:36.403
And then down all the way
over here would be 0%.

00:03:36.403 --> 00:03:38.986
And then the Thrill Soda graph
would be all the way down here.

00:03:38.986 --> 00:03:40.474
So it was like 12%.

00:03:40.474 --> 00:03:43.946
And it goes all the
way up to like 25%.

00:03:43.946 --> 00:03:46.422
So the Thrill Soda, it
would have looked something

00:03:46.422 --> 00:03:46.922
like this.

00:03:46.922 --> 00:03:48.575
The graph would have
looked something

00:03:48.575 --> 00:03:50.394
like this, which
is nowhere near.

00:03:50.394 --> 00:03:54.362
If you plotted these on the
same scale, on the same graph,

00:03:54.362 --> 00:03:56.842
then it would have still
been pretty obvious

00:03:56.842 --> 00:03:59.322
that-- even though the trend
is downward-- a lot more

00:03:59.322 --> 00:04:03.786
people prefer Yummy
Cola to Thrill Cola.

00:04:03.786 --> 00:04:07.258
So there's two very disingenuous
things going on over here.

00:04:07.258 --> 00:04:08.746
One is the actual scale.

00:04:08.746 --> 00:04:12.237
For this amount of distance on
this scale, they represent 10%.

00:04:12.237 --> 00:04:14.570
So whatever the gain is, it
looks like it's a huge gain.

00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:16.554
And over here, on
that same amount,

00:04:16.554 --> 00:04:18.470
they're actually
representing a larger amount.

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:20.870
They're representing
closer to 15% or 16%.

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:24.470
And then the main thing is they
started the scale here at 50%.

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:26.870
So they're not showing how
many people really prefer,

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:30.170
how large 80% or
even 70% really is.

00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:32.046
And over here, they
start at 0% and they just

00:04:32.046 --> 00:04:32.878
have a larger scale.

00:04:32.878 --> 00:04:35.270
So it makes it look like out
the gate, a lot of people

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:37.970
prefer, or a comparable amount
of people prefer, Thrill

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:39.470
and that the trend is up.

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:43.070
But the reality is still way
more people prefer Yummy Cola.

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:44.870
So this was a little
bit-- or actually

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:49.070
a very, very, not-so-honest
way of representing the data.

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:51.820
Or I guess you could say they're
misrepresenting the data.
