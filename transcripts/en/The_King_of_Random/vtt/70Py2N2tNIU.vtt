00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:01.820
[Captions by Judy V. at Y Translator]
The Silver Play Button is an award

00:00:01.820 --> 00:00:05.360
given out by YouTube to channels
who reach 100,000 subscribers.

00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:06.460
Well, for whatever reason,

00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:10.180
we happen to have an additional
or extra Silver Play Button,

00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:13.080
and so, we are going to see
what happens if we melt this down.

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:22.820
[Music]

00:00:22.829 --> 00:00:24.500
The channel JerryRigEverything
did some tests,

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:28.420
and found that these old-style play buttons
are made of about 95 percent nickel.

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:30.900
So, we're going to throw it into
our furnace and see what happens.

00:00:30.909 --> 00:00:33.020
Our furnace only gets up to
about 2,000 degrees,

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:37.040
whereas the melting point of nickel
is more like 25 or 26 hundred degrees.

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:38.720
Those are both in Fahrenheit.

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:41.580
But we do want to see what
happens if we just heat it up to 2000.

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:42.420
Maybe it gets soft.

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:43.620
Maybe it starts glowing.

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:46.040
I'm curious if the finish
is going to get destroyed,

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:47.660
and then if this furnace doesn't work,

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:49.460
we have our backup arc furnace,

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:51.700
which definitely gets
hot enough to melt it down.

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:54.080
So if it doesn't melt here,
and we'll try melting it there.

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:55.200
Pretty straightforward.

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:56.540
Let's put our play button down in there,

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:58.640
fire up the furnace and
see what happens to it.

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:10.700
[Music]

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:12.000
That was kind of cool right when it lit,

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:12.960
it like fogged up.

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:14.540
And I thought like,
"Oh! It's already ruined."

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:15.920
But then it just cleared right up.

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:17.700
So I guess that was
just some sort of vapor.

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:21.840
[Music]

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:22.640
Oh!

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:24.880
That. Look at that.

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:26.700
The top corner is-- Oh! On the edges.

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.260
Yeah starting to like bubble now.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.100
So I'm pretty sure the surface
is actually also made of nickel,

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:36.520
but it's like a cleaner nickel plating
that's applied in a different method.

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:38.560
It's not cast with the rest of it.

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:42.100
So they probably, in a mold,
they cast the main button,

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:44.760
and then they plate
over the whole button.

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:48.120
Now, we're getting
some iridescent effects.

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:50.420
Yeah, that surface is
getting kind of wrecked.

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:52.040
[Music]

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:52.780
Neat.

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:57.220
[Music]

00:01:57.220 --> 00:01:58.100
That looks awesome.

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:00.300
[Music]

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:01.200
Ooh! Wow!

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.360
[Music]

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:04.780
I think this is melting.

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:06.920
[Music]

00:02:06.929 --> 00:02:10.000
Yeah, the inside of the
cup is now full of liquid.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.840
[Music]

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:19.280
Oh well so much for this
just being a solid piece of nickel

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:21.220
that melts at 2,600 degrees.

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:25.280
That took about three minutes
to completely liquefy.

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:35.500
[Music]

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:38.420
So that makes me think
maybe this one is zinc,

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:41.660
which melts at about
700 degrees Fahrenheit

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:44.380
instead of 2600 degrees Fahrenheit.

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:51.280
[Music]

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:55.340
This right here was the
surface of the play button.

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:58.060
About half of it.

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:09.820
[Music]

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:13.720
Well, it started out as silver shiny metal,
and it's silver shiny metal again.

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:15.000
Fascinating!

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:17.620
Overall, this has been pretty surprising.

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:20.420
I really didn't think that was
going to melt in this furnace at all.

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:21.020
But it did.

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:24.200
In fact it melted in like
two, maybe three minutes.

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:26.200
It just turned into a
puddle down in the cup.

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:29.044
All of the shell that was
around It didn't melt.

00:03:29.044 --> 00:03:31.900
It sort of fell in and ended up
as slag down in the cup

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:33.260
surrounded by molten metal,

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:35.460
but I'm going to see if I can
take this molten metal,

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:38.760
and I'm going to pour it
into a bowl full of Orbeez,

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:40.500
and I just want to see what comes out,

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:42.320
and then if we can
get a cool cast out of it.

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:48.740
[Music]

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:50.340
Three, two, one.

00:03:50.340 --> 00:04:01.720
[Music]

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:02.880
Oh!

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:05.420
[Music]

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:07.440
Oh! Limited--

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:11.000
Limited use on those  glass
containers full of molten metal.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.620
Now, I got Orbeez
spilled all over the place.

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:15.720
Let's grab some cool
water and cool that off.

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:25.680
[Music]

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:28.060
This is just a little chunk
of glass from our bowl,

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:30.060
just stuck into the metal here.

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:31.180
I want to pry it out,

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:32.760
but I don't want to push
too hard with my fingers

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:34.780
'cause I'll probably end up
just cutting myself on it.

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:38.080
[Music]

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:40.360
Well, here is our Silver Play Button.

00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:42.680
It's-- it's a little bit changed shape,

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:45.240
doesn't look quite the
same way it did before,

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:48.380
and because of how
low temperature this melted.

00:04:48.389 --> 00:04:50.790
I'm now quite curious
about what metal this is.

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:51.900
I'm thinking it might be zinc,

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:54.900
or maybe even just tin,
which has a very low melting point.

00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:58.520
But that melted so quickly and so easily

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:01.160
that I'm positive it wasn't nickel.

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:04.120
Because our furnace doesn't even
get hot enough to melt nickel.

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:07.920
So yeah, might have to do some tests
to try and figure out just what this was.

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:09.840
It still is. It's still metal.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:11.680
It's just not a play button anymore,

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:12.880
but I don't know,
maybe that would look good,

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:14.440
just on a plaque on the wall too.

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:15.740
I want to display this.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:17.500
Let's build a little display for this thing.

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:18.460
This is going to be fun.

00:05:18.460 --> 00:06:26.200
[Music]

00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:28.940
Our Silver Play Button has been
melted down and cast into a new shape,

00:06:28.940 --> 00:06:30.460
and I gave that a nice little stand.

00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:32.500
So we've got ourselves like a new award.

00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:33.060
What do you think?

00:06:33.060 --> 00:06:34.840
Should YouTube keep
giving out this style?

00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:36.620
Or maybe should they move on to this one?

00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:38.060
I don't know.
Maybe it's an upgrade.

00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:39.380
Maybe not.

00:06:39.380 --> 00:06:41.060
But I like how it turned out.

00:06:41.060 --> 00:06:41.700
I am curious.

00:06:41.700 --> 00:06:44.400
I'm gonna have to do some tests to
find out what kind of metal this is

00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:46.700
because it's definitely not nickel.

00:06:46.700 --> 00:06:49.480
So maybe this was a different
edition of the play button

00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:51.340
than the one that
JerryRigEverything tested.

00:06:51.340 --> 00:06:53.680
In fact, I bet pretty strongly that it is.

00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:56.880
So, we'll have to do some tests of our own
and find out what this one is made of.

00:06:57.720 --> 00:06:59.680
Guys. That's not all,
we've got more for you to see.

00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:02.720
That little box up at the top
transports you directly to our last video.

00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:03.860
You should go check that out.

00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:06.900
The box is the bottom shows you what
YouTube thinks you need to be watching next,

00:07:06.900 --> 00:07:09.480
and this bomb here in the middle
will subscribe you to the channel.

00:07:09.480 --> 00:07:11.200
So you never miss out on a video.

00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:13.060
Don't forget to ring the bell
and we'll see you in the next one.

00:07:13.060 --> 00:07:14.080
Talk to you then.
