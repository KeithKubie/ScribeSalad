00:02:45.585 --> 00:02:47.585
 what else? 

00:02:50.879 --> 00:02:54.991
Shelves shelves and books, 
what's on the walls? 

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:07.068
You 
said more books but sometimes 

00:03:07.069 --> 00:03:09.346
there's pictures and posters and
 all 

00:03:09.347 --> 00:03:15.223
kinds of fun things on the walls
. You had something to say.

00:03:21.427 --> 00:03:27.861
There is pictures of people.
    That's right.  Excellent 

00:03:27.863 --> 00:03:30.693
Sometimes there's pictures of 
people and 

00:03:30.694 --> 00:03:33.670
sometimes those people are 
authors and sometimes they're 

00:03:33.671 --> 00:03:36.351
famous people 
and sometimes those people are 

00:03:36.352 --> 00:03:39.787
you guys, and I bet some of the 
walls 

00:03:39.788 --> 00:03:44.754
are on the -- there's posters on
 the wall and opportunities to 

00:03:44.755 --> 00:03:49.212
do all 
kinds of activities with young 

00:03:49.213 --> 00:03:51.783
people like today when we have a
 very 

00:03:51.784 --> 00:03:55.719
special author with us. I know 
you all mow what authors are, 

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:58.566
right? 
What do authors do.

00:03:58.567 --> 00:04:02.810
    They write the books.
    Right, they write the books.

00:04:02.811 --> 00:04:05.783
 Do they also illustrate the 
books? 

00:04:05.784 --> 00:04:13.787
Sometimes. Well in this case, I 
have a feeling all of you are 

00:04:13.788 --> 00:04:17.312
authors 
too. Have you alien stuff? I 

00:04:17.313 --> 00:04:22.170
think you guys are.
    Well, when you guys read 

00:04:22.171 --> 00:04:25.310
books, or when somebody reads 
you a book 

00:04:25.311 --> 00:04:29.719
how often do you think about the
 person who wrote the book?

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:34.458
    That's my wish for you today
. I hope after this opportunity 

00:04:34.459 --> 00:04:37.093
to 
meet an author today I hope that

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:38.971
 every single book that you read
 from 

00:04:38.972 --> 00:04:42.349
now on you think a little bit 
about the author and the 

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:44.222
illustrate for 
of the book because when you 

00:04:44.223 --> 00:04:47.425
read a book and make a 
connection of that 

00:04:47.426 --> 00:04:51.460
book you're making connection to
 that author too and that's 

00:04:51.461 --> 00:04:53.690
really 
special and also a connection to

00:04:53.694 --> 00:04:56.867
 anyone who will read the book, 
and 

00:04:56.868 --> 00:05:03.561
that's special too. So I'm de
lighted to invite Shana Corey, 

00:05:03.562 --> 00:05:05.264
she's 
going to talk about us today 

00:05:05.265 --> 00:05:09.264
about a book she wrote recently 
about 

00:05:09.265 --> 00:05:13.352
John F. Kennedy and a very 
important speech that he deliver

00:05:13.819 --> 00:05:19.938
ed in 1963. 
Now if he were still alive he 

00:05:19.939 --> 00:05:23.315
would be celebrating his 100 
birthday 

00:05:23.316 --> 00:05:29.129
this month. Do you think that's 
a long time? You're itching to 

00:05:29.130 --> 00:05:32.127
say 
something, I'm going to call on 

00:05:32.128 --> 00:05:35.553
you and ask you to put your hand
s down 

00:05:35.554 --> 00:05:39.954
and so we can get started.
    Sometimes people

00:05:43.809 --> 00:05:46.627
 paint the walls.
    That's right. That's so true

00:05:46.784 --> 00:05:49.568
. You guys are going to have a 
chance 

00:05:49.569 --> 00:05:54.304
to say things later so please 
put your hands down, let's give 

00:05:54.305 --> 00:05:57.749
a very 
welcome to Shana and thank you, 

00:05:57.750 --> 00:06:00.582
we're so exciteed to hear from 
you and 

00:06:00.583 --> 00:06:04.332
about the artwork that is also 
here that your colleague 

00:06:04.333 --> 00:06:06.398
contributeed to 
the book so thank you.

00:06:06.399 --> 00:06:10.394
    Thank you, I'm so excited to
 be here you guys. This is a the

00:06:13.408 --> 00:06:14.810
like mission control for 
libraries, 

00:06:14.811 --> 00:06:16.925
that's pretty cool right?
    Yeah.

00:06:16.926 --> 00:06:22.333
    Yeah. So I'm here today 
because I'm an author but I want

00:06:22.753 --> 00:06:25.017
 always an 
author -- do you want to see a 

00:06:25.018 --> 00:06:28.165
picture of me before I was 
author?

00:06:28.166 --> 00:06:30.889
    Yeah.
    This was me when I was about

00:06:31.300 --> 00:06:33.567
 your age maybe first grade. 
Does that 

00:06:33.568 --> 00:06:35.988
look like me?
    Yes.

00:06:35.989 --> 00:06:42.607
    So it would look like me if 
I had a big red

00:06:47.925 --> 00:06:53.202
 bow -- who is that? 
Madeline -- I love Madeline. 

00:06:53.341 --> 00:06:55.455
Madeline is a great book. 
There's copies 

00:06:55.456 --> 00:07:00.023
in the back here so if you get 
one tip from today if you want 

00:07:00.024 --> 00:07:03.701
to learn 
to draw a big hair bow, two 

00:07:03.702 --> 00:07:07.337
triangles and you have your hair
 bow.

00:07:07.338 --> 00:07:13.290
    Do you want to see what I 
really looked like when I was 

00:07:13.291 --> 00:07:15.810
your age 
this. was me when I was in 

00:07:15.811 --> 00:07:20.432
elementary school. Which one am 
I? Raise 

00:07:20.433 --> 00:07:26.563
your hand if you think I'm the 
one with braids no? Raise your 

00:07:26.564 --> 00:07:30.299
hand if 
you think I'm the bossy big 

00:07:30.300 --> 00:07:33.677
sister? You guys? Hands down. 
I'm the 

00:07:33.678 --> 00:07:37.489
bossy big sister. That's me and 
my sister Marse.

00:07:37.490 --> 00:07:41.841
    Now I once an author yet in 
that picture. Can you guys hear 

00:07:41.842 --> 00:07:44.826
me -- 
I wasn't an author yet in that 

00:07:44.827 --> 00:07:46.957
picture but I was doing 
something that 

00:07:46.958 --> 00:07:51.346
was getting me ready to be an 
author. What do you think I was 

00:07:51.347 --> 00:07:54.492
doing 
when I was in first or second 

00:07:54.493 --> 00:07:57.633
grade to get ready to be an 
author?

00:07:57.634 --> 00:08:03.837
    Reading books.
    You guys don't -- raise your

00:08:03.840 --> 00:08:06.738
 hand if you love to read. Oh 
good. 

00:08:06.739 --> 00:08:10.590
Then you guys, you're all on 
your way to being authors 

00:08:10.591 --> 00:08:13.111
because read 
something the most important 

00:08:13.112 --> 00:08:15.406
thing you can do if you want to 
be an 

00:08:15.407 --> 00:08:17.957
author.
    So when I was growing up 

00:08:17.958 --> 00:08:22.523
these were some of my favorite 
books, 

00:08:22.524 --> 00:08:28.175
little house on the Perry, Betsy
 Casey, I like reading so much 

00:08:28.176 --> 00:08:30.925
when I 
grew up I decided I wanted to 

00:08:30.926 --> 00:08:33.909
have a job where I could be 
around books 

00:08:33.910 --> 00:08:38.848
all day long. Can you guys -- 
what I don't knows where you can

00:08:39.311 --> 00:08:41.281
 be 
around books all day long.

00:08:41.282 --> 00:08:46.402
    At the library.
    You can be a librarian, and 

00:08:46.403 --> 00:08:49.123
this would be your office and 
you 

00:08:49.124 --> 00:08:53.516
could take any books home you 
wanted. That would be pretty 

00:08:53.517 --> 00:08:58.768
cool.
    What kind of books can you 

00:08:58.769 --> 00:09:03.875
think of -- book jobs.
    An author or an I will 

00:09:03.876 --> 00:09:05.876
administrator -- 
    So you can write or draw the

00:09:05.895 --> 00:09:09.512
 pictures. What kind of book 
jobs can 

00:09:09.513 --> 00:09:16.984
you think of?
    I think you could be around 

00:09:16.985 --> 00:09:18.985
books

00:09:20.117 --> 00:09:24.270
 paint pictures.
    You can paint pictures. This

00:09:24.271 --> 00:09:26.853
 book our Gregory

00:09:29.926 --> 00:09:33.261
 Christy, he painted 
these pictures, he's around 

00:09:33.262 --> 00:09:35.750
books all day and then draws 
pictures. 

00:09:35.751 --> 00:09:38.239
What kind of book job can you 
think of?

00:09:38.240 --> 00:09:43.436
    One last book job that I can
 think of is organizing books.

00:09:43.437 --> 00:09:48.556
    That's a really good one. 
Organizing books. Do you think 

00:09:48.557 --> 00:09:52.253
librarian
librarians organize books? Yeah.

00:09:58.970 --> 00:10:04.895
I'm wearing book earrings that's
 true. I decideed to get a job 

00:10:04.896 --> 00:10:07.865
-- 
hold onto I don't thoughts -- 

00:10:07.866 --> 00:10:10.609
being something called arch 
editor, does 

00:10:10.610 --> 00:10:12.902
anyone know what's an editor? 

00:10:18.002 --> 00:10:23.806
    Interesting. So that's part 
of what an editor does, they 

00:10:23.807 --> 00:10:26.089
make sure 
a lot of people are going to get

00:10:26.240 --> 00:10:30.799
 copies of the books.  I should 
repeat 

00:10:30.800 --> 00:10:38.726
your answer so friends can hear 
that are far away -- he said 

00:10:38.727 --> 00:10:41.861
editors 
giveaway books. What else does a

00:10:42.160 --> 00:10:46.425
 an editor do.
    I think an editor -- I don't

00:10:46.426 --> 00:10:50.408
 know.
    I think an editor is like a 

00:10:50.409 --> 00:10:54.815
teacher. Do your teachers make 
your 

00:10:54.816 --> 00:11:01.235
work better? So editors are help
 authors to make their stories 

00:11:01.236 --> 00:11:02.910
better. 
Here's my office in New York 

00:11:02.911 --> 00:11:06.499
City, I work at random house 
children's 

00:11:06.500 --> 00:11:12.879
books, and it's just like I 
always wanted. I'm surrounded by

00:11:13.175 --> 00:11:17.726
 books all 
day long. I work on books for 

00:11:17.727 --> 00:11:21.827
big kids, early readers, and 
they're 

00:11:21.828 --> 00:11:29.118
about history because I love 
history, I do -- do you know the

00:11:29.174 --> 00:11:31.933
 George 
Washington the general's dog? I 

00:11:31.934 --> 00:11:34.051
love that book. That's an 
excellent 

00:11:34.052 --> 00:11:36.783
book.
    So those -- it's really good

00:11:37.031 --> 00:11:40.630
. I really recommend it. Those 
books 

00:11:40.631 --> 00:11:45.032
are true story.
    What's a book that has a 

00:11:45.033 --> 00:11:47.461
true story -- what's a book 
called when 

00:11:47.462 --> 00:11:49.462
it's a true story?

00:11:53.983 --> 00:12:00.117
When they read the book -- 
    People read books to 

00:12:00.118 --> 00:12:03.800
children that don't have books.
    What were you going to say? 

00:12:04.101 --> 00:12:07.826
What was the question again?
    What's the book called when 

00:12:07.827 --> 00:12:11.187
the story is a true story? 
Fiction.

00:12:11.188 --> 00:12:17.051
    Really close. Non-fiction.
    Fiction is something that's 

00:12:17.052 --> 00:12:22.548
made up. Exactly.
    So I also work on books -- I

00:12:22.552 --> 00:12:26.449
 have worked on series like baby
 math 

00:12:26.450 --> 00:12:30.082
and another series that you guys
 wouldn't know, I don't think, 

00:12:30.083 --> 00:12:38.644
no one 
has ever heard of Jones? I love 

00:12:38.645 --> 00:12:44.388
it -- I have it in my backpack 
too. I 

00:12:44.389 --> 00:12:49.040
love Judey B. Jones. After I had
 been editing for a while I 

00:12:49.041 --> 00:12:51.583
decideed I 
wanted to write my own story. 

00:12:51.735 --> 00:12:54.410
When you guys write stories 
where do you 

00:12:54.411 --> 00:12:56.411
get your ideas? 

00:12:59.267 --> 00:13:03.106
From your brain.
    Where do you get your ideas?

00:13:03.107 --> 00:13:08.384
 Where do you get your ideas?
    I get my ideas from books

00:13:10.805 --> 00:13:13.212
From other books. That's a great
 place.

00:13:13.213 --> 00:13:19.915
    Where do you get your ideas 
from? So sometimes I get ideas 

00:13:19.916 --> 00:13:21.916
from 
maybe

00:13:24.881 --> 00:13:27.286
 poetry.
    That's fabulous, where do 

00:13:27.287 --> 00:13:30.970
you get your ideas?
    I get my ideas from other 

00:13:30.971 --> 00:13:33.109
books because when I read a book
 it 

00:13:33.110 --> 00:13:38.367
makes me think what I can do.
    That's -- you guys are -- 

00:13:38.368 --> 00:13:43.471
have such great ideas. Journals 
to 

00:13:43.472 --> 00:13:48.627
poetry, because when she reads 
books she gets idea ofs of what 

00:13:48.628 --> 00:13:51.859
else to 
do. Where do you get your ideas?

00:13:51.860 --> 00:13:57.130
    From pictures. That's a 
great idea. Anyone have one more

00:13:57.984 --> 00:14:01.317
?
    Pictures and facts. You guys

00:14:02.539 --> 00:14:06.238
 you sure you're first gradeers?
 That's 

00:14:06.239 --> 00:14:10.068
really good answers. I get a lot
 of ideas from facts because I 

00:14:10.069 --> 00:14:12.553
write a 
lot of non-fiction.

00:14:12.554 --> 00:14:16.493
    You write non-fiction too --
 I love non-fiction.

00:14:16.494 --> 00:14:19.875
    So put your hands down for a
 second and I'll tell you some 

00:14:19.876 --> 00:14:22.895
of the 
stories that I've written and 

00:14:22.896 --> 00:14:25.736
then we'll read the one about J 
FK.

00:14:25.737 --> 00:14:31.260
    A lot of my stories -- can 
you hear me? A lot of my stories

00:14:31.859 --> 00:14:33.984
 are 
about real people, people that 

00:14:33.985 --> 00:14:36.660
inspire me. And I get inspireed 
by 

00:14:36.661 --> 00:14:42.941
people who do things to create 
change, like things they say I 

00:14:42.942 --> 00:14:44.049
want to 
change the words.

00:14:44.050 --> 00:14:48.770
    Some of my first books are 
about real lady that's liveed a 

00:14:48.771 --> 00:14:50.901
long 
time ago and they didn't like 

00:14:50.902 --> 00:14:54.876
the clothes women liveed a lock 
time ago 

00:14:54.877 --> 00:14:59.883
-- does anyone know about old 
day cloths? 

00:14:59.884 --> 00:15:07.699
    They would wear dresses.
    They were wearing dresses, 

00:15:07.700 --> 00:15:10.096
long dresses. What else do you 
know 

00:15:10.097 --> 00:15:15.227
about olden day clothes?
    Sometimes they would only 

00:15:15.228 --> 00:15:18.193
wear halts because they're only 
allowed 

00:15:18.194 --> 00:15:21.387
hats.
    They had to wear hats and 

00:15:21.388 --> 00:15:24.457
bonets a lot of times. Are any 
of you 

00:15:24.458 --> 00:15:31.199
guys going to go swimming this 
summer? Yeah. Any of you going 

00:15:31.200 --> 00:15:33.711
to wear 
a batheing suit that looks like 

00:15:33.712 --> 00:15:38.834
this? No? A long time ago women 
used to 

00:15:38.835 --> 00:15:41.804
wear batheing suit that's looked
 like this, but girls you're 

00:15:41.805 --> 00:15:45.952
going to 
wear tights, you can't go 

00:15:45.953 --> 00:15:50.548
swimming without tights right? 
Well this was 

00:15:50.549 --> 00:15:55.987
a lady has lived a long time ago
 and she was a champion swimmer 

00:15:55.988 --> 00:15:59.301
and 
she thought you can't win races 

00:15:59.302 --> 00:16:02.477
and set records in those kind of
 bathe

00:16:02.478 --> 00:16:07.707
bathing sites so she invented 
her own batheing suit. That's 

00:16:07.708 --> 00:16:09.413
how batheing 
suits were invented.

00:16:09.414 --> 00:16:16.087
    I write some book that's are
 historic calfiction. Do you 

00:16:16.088 --> 00:16:19.519
know what 
historical fiction is?

00:16:19.520 --> 00:16:26.049
    That's exactly right, 
historical but fake, some parts 

00:16:26.050 --> 00:16:28.735
are true and 
some are made up. So I'm going 

00:16:28.736 --> 00:16:32.425
to tell you which parts of this 
are 

00:16:32.426 --> 00:16:40.457
true and which are made up. This
 is about the all American girl 

00:16:40.458 --> 00:16:43.801
professional baseball league, 
and it started during World War 

00:16:43.802 --> 00:16:47.107
II, all 
of this is true because all of 

00:16:47.108 --> 00:16:52.056
the boys that played base you 
ball went 

00:16:52.057 --> 00:16:58.948
off to the war. President 
Roosevelt said you have to keep 

00:16:58.949 --> 00:17:01.473
baseball 
going, so I did all the research

00:17:01.482 --> 00:17:04.601
 for this book, here's real 
pictures 

00:17:04.602 --> 00:17:09.141
of the team, here's another real
 picture, but I had a problem, I

00:17:11.273 --> 00:17:13.950
because I had all the facts 
about the 

00:17:13.951 --> 00:17:17.535
league, but I didn't have a main
 character because there were so

00:17:17.536 --> 00:17:20.531
 many 
people that played baseball in 

00:17:20.532 --> 00:17:23.911
this league. Hold onto your 
thoughts.

00:17:23.912 --> 00:17:28.476
    Then it went to the library 
because you can always find 

00:17:28.477 --> 00:17:30.739
facts and 
answers at the library, right. 

00:17:30.740 --> 00:17:34.583
So I found this old book in this
 secret 

00:17:34.584 --> 00:17:38.835
room on the third room of the 
library -- I don't know if I was

00:17:38.984 --> 00:17:41.573
 suppose
supposed to be up there, there 

00:17:41.574 --> 00:17:44.558
were dusty old books and I when 
I read 

00:17:44.559 --> 00:17:50.211
the book I got goose bumps 
because this old book -- do you 

00:17:50.212 --> 00:17:53.893
know the 
song take me out to the ball 

00:17:53.894 --> 00:17:57.504
game. Can you guys all together 
say just 

00:17:57.505 --> 00:18:02.261
the first line of the song -- 
take me out to the ball game.

00:18:02.262 --> 00:18:07.879
    Okay, hold obtain your hats,
 guess what? That's not really 

00:18:07.880 --> 00:18:09.995
the 
first line of that song. When 

00:18:09.996 --> 00:18:12.118
they opened that book I couldn't
 believe 

00:18:12.119 --> 00:18:16.264
it, there's a whole verse that 
comes before that and that's the

00:18:16.522 --> 00:18:18.390
 kind 
of stuff you can find when 

00:18:18.391 --> 00:18:22.642
you're researching in libraryies
, the first 

00:18:22.643 --> 00:18:30.199
line is Katie case ball mad, had
 the fever and had it bad. When 

00:18:30.200 --> 00:18:32.967
I read 
it I got goose bumps. When

00:18:36.782 --> 00:18:40.895
 everyone sing that's song about
 baseball, 

00:18:40.896 --> 00:18:45.654
that song is really about girls 
so I decided to make Katie Casey

00:18:45.698 --> 00:18:47.832
 my 
main character. So that's why 

00:18:47.833 --> 00:18:50.662
it's historical fiction, my main

00:18:50.663 --> 00:18:53.390
character is made up.
    I've also written a book 

00:18:53.391 --> 00:18:56.632
about the first subway in New 
York City. 

00:18:56.633 --> 00:19:02.353
And before I tell you about that
 book I have a question, had 

00:19:02.354 --> 00:19:05.330
anyone 
seen liter on the street? Has 

00:19:05.331 --> 00:19:07.756
anyone been struck in traffic? 
Believe 

00:19:07.757 --> 00:19:13.770
it or not the liter in the 
streets especially in New York 

00:19:13.771 --> 00:19:16.850
si was worse 
150 years ago than today -- it's

00:19:18.186 --> 00:19:20.083
 so bad I don't know if I should
 show 

00:19:20.084 --> 00:19:24.237
you a picture -- it's so gross. 
You sure you want to see it -- 

00:19:24.238 --> 00:19:29.648
this is 
what the liter looked like 150 

00:19:29.649 --> 00:19:32.500
years ago. This was before state

00:19:32.501 --> 00:19:37.374
cleaning, before recycleing, and
 the streets are a mess.

00:19:37.375 --> 00:19:43.007
    So, they were gross -- and 
can anyone tell me how did 

00:19:43.008 --> 00:19:46.835
people get 
around 150 years ago? How did 

00:19:46.836 --> 00:19:51.716
they get around? 
    Horses pulled people in cart

00:19:51.720 --> 00:19:54.239
s some if there were a lot of 
horses 

00:19:54.240 --> 00:19:57.358
on the streets what else was on 
the streets that horses produce

00:19:57.664 --> 00:20:03.486
ed?
    YesYes, horse poop. So the 

00:20:03.487 --> 00:20:06.061
streets were really, really 
gross, there's 

00:20:06.062 --> 00:20:12.578
another picture. Although they 
hadn't invented things stoplight

00:20:12.876 --> 00:20:17.838
s, they 
hasn't invented stop signs or 

00:20:17.839 --> 00:20:19.986
stoplights or even lines there's
 no lane

00:20:19.987 --> 00:20:24.521
lanes in that picture because 
traffic was new so this man 

00:20:24.522 --> 00:20:28.414
named Alfred 
had an idea, he was going to 

00:20:28.415 --> 00:20:34.329
invent a subway. You rode the 
Metra here? 

00:20:34.330 --> 00:20:40.815
You just -- he wanted to invent 
a different kind of subway, a 

00:20:40.816 --> 00:20:43.499
subway 
that ran on knew mattic power. 

00:20:44.178 --> 00:20:47.650
Do you annoy what that is do you
 know 

00:20:47.651 --> 00:20:54.657
what Newman tic power?
    It's the subway stays -- 

00:20:54.658 --> 00:20:58.958
stays old forever?
    Stays on forever. That's a 

00:20:58.959 --> 00:21:03.061
good thought. Will you be my 
volunteer. 

00:21:03.062 --> 00:21:07.768
I need someone to doll tear.
    Are you really good at 

00:21:07.769 --> 00:21:09.033
science?
    Yes.

00:21:09.034 --> 00:21:14.488
    We have a scientist here who
 is going to demonstrate knew 

00:21:14.489 --> 00:21:16.892
mattic 
power for us. Can you take this 

00:21:16.893 --> 00:21:20.267
and blow it.
    I have a question for you --

00:21:20.567 --> 00:21:22.145
 I didn't see you take your hand
 and 

00:21:22.146 --> 00:21:26.839
move that, what force can you 
use to move that. Wind, air. And

00:21:27.105 --> 00:21:30.380
 that's 
what knew mattic power is, it's 

00:21:30.381 --> 00:21:34.083
air power.
    So he he used area power -- 

00:21:34.084 --> 00:21:36.345
you want to hold onto that. You 
can 

00:21:36.346 --> 00:21:40.647
have it at the end.
    Request we give her a round 

00:21:40.648 --> 00:21:41.956
of.
    (APPLAUSE) applause.

00:21:41.957 --> 00:21:48.355
    So they used air to move the
 subway back and forth.

00:21:48.356 --> 00:21:51.721
    The book I'm going to read 
today is about this person. Who 

00:21:51.722 --> 00:21:55.109
is that
that? John F. Kennedy, who would

00:21:55.112 --> 00:21:57.536
 be 100 at the end of this month
.

00:21:57.537 --> 00:22:02.397
    And he inspireed me because 
he's a real person and he had a 

00:22:02.398 --> 00:22:06.348
decision to make if he was going
 to be brave and stand up for 

00:22:06.349 --> 00:22:10.487
something he believed in. So 
should we read the story and see

00:22:10.636 --> 00:22:11.209
 what he 
did.

00:22:11.210 --> 00:22:16.159
    I'm going to see if I can 
put this here so I can turn the 

00:22:16.160 --> 00:22:19.594
pages in 
my book and be a little up 

00:22:19.595 --> 00:22:24.413
closer.
    A time to act. What's a book

00:22:24.861 --> 00:22:26.701
 called when it's about a person
? Do 

00:22:26.702 --> 00:22:28.736
you know the name? Yes? 

00:22:35.141 --> 00:22:42.050
Biology. Biography, so this is a
 biography of 

00:22:42.051 --> 00:22:44.898
John F. Kennedy and it's non-
fiction.

00:22:44.899 --> 00:22:47.020
    I'm going to read it here 
and turn the pages.

00:22:47.021 --> 00:22:51.162
    John F. Kennedy loves to 
read about history, but history 

00:22:51.163 --> 00:22:53.950
isn't 
just in books it's happening all

00:22:53.959 --> 00:22:57.192
 around us and the people that 
make 

00:22:57.193 --> 00:23:00.464
history aren't just famous 
leaders, they're real people 

00:23:00.465 --> 00:23:03.406
just like you, 
sometimes they are you.

00:23:03.407 --> 00:23:09.136
    John or Jack as he was 
called was a second of nine 

00:23:09.137 --> 00:23:11.862
children in a 
big rich family. If you saw the 

00:23:11.863 --> 00:23:13.470
Kennedy's you might think they 
had 

00:23:13.471 --> 00:23:17.461
everything. But take a closer 
look, Jack wasn't the favorite, 

00:23:17.462 --> 00:23:21.764
that was 
his big brother Joe. The father 

00:23:21.765 --> 00:23:26.567
wanted Joe to grow up to be the 
President. Jack didn't always do

00:23:26.878 --> 00:23:30.268
 well in school. He is call all 
and 

00:23:30.269 --> 00:23:35.821
disorderly and could sell his 
possessions and he was often 

00:23:35.822 --> 00:23:38.249
sick. But 
he was funny and people liked 

00:23:38.250 --> 00:23:41.084
him. When Jack was too sick to 
play 

00:23:41.085 --> 00:23:45.641
outdoors he read.
    Jack's mother taught her 

00:23:45.642 --> 00:23:47.462
children the importance of 
giving back to 

00:23:47.463 --> 00:23:54.288
one's country. Jack too that 
belief seriously. John joined 

00:23:54.289 --> 00:23:58.293
the fight 
on August 2, 1943 the end me 

00:23:58.294 --> 00:24:01.584
ship ripped into the boat he 
commanded he 

00:24:01.585 --> 00:24:07.676
led the survivors to safety, 
towing one of the injured three 

00:24:07.677 --> 00:24:09.959
miles 
while he swam.

00:24:09.960 --> 00:24:15.223
    I'm reading -- I'm not 
reading the whole thing because 

00:24:15.224 --> 00:24:18.201
I want to 
have time for questions and for 

00:24:18.202 --> 00:24:21.052
me to show you how it became a 
book.

00:24:21.053 --> 00:24:27.002
    Jack's brother Joe also 
serveed the country. Jack was 

00:24:27.003 --> 00:24:30.706
killed flying 
over the English channel. The 

00:24:30.707 --> 00:24:33.414
family was heart broken. Now it 
was up 

00:24:33.415 --> 00:24:39.839
to Jack to carry out his father
's dreams for Joe. In 1946 Jack 

00:24:39.840 --> 00:24:41.521
ran for 
Congress. The whole family 

00:24:41.522 --> 00:24:45.943
helped. After six years as 
congressmen, he 

00:24:45.944 --> 00:24:49.074
was electricity to the the 
Senate. They loveed his

00:24:53.321 --> 00:24:56.283
 -- Jack had back 
surgery, while he recovered he 

00:24:56.284 --> 00:24:59.450
wrote another book with the help
 of his 

00:24:59.451 --> 00:25:03.495
staff. It told about people who 
had the courage to take a stand 

00:25:03.496 --> 00:25:06.702
for 
things they believed in. Even 

00:25:06.703 --> 00:25:10.655
when they weren't popular. Have 
you guys 

00:25:10.656 --> 00:25:13.236
ever done something really brave
?

00:25:13.237 --> 00:25:18.809
    What have you done that's 
really brave? Jack was --

00:25:24.206 --> 00:25:28.854
    Going into a pool is really 
brave, especially if you're not 

00:25:28.855 --> 00:25:30.338
sure 
about it.

00:25:30.339 --> 00:25:34.336
    What else have you done 
that's really brave? 

00:25:45.386 --> 00:25:48.515
Oh, wow, jumping into 
a pool is a really brave thing. 

00:25:48.773 --> 00:25:51.349
You guys are a bunch of brave 
kids.

00:25:51.350 --> 00:25:57.834
    On January 2, 1960, Jack 
announceed he was running for 

00:25:57.835 --> 00:25:59.835
President --

00:26:06.138 --> 00:26:08.547
 into a powerful speaker but not

00:26:08.548 --> 00:26:12.229
everyone thought he would win. 
Do you think it would be run to 

00:26:12.230 --> 00:26:15.378
office 
if you think people would say 

00:26:15.379 --> 00:26:19.362
you couldn't win.
    He was 42 years old, younger

00:26:20.973 --> 00:26:24.082
 thanmy President-Elected before
. 

00:26:24.083 --> 00:26:29.187
President Eisenhower called him 
-- 

00:26:29.188 --> 00:26:35.490
    My deer boy, I only say 
these things for your own good, 

00:26:35.491 --> 00:26:37.124
and Jack 
was Catholic. Many people 

00:26:37.125 --> 00:26:40.587
believed that the country 
wouldn't 

00:26:40.588 --> 00:26:45.969
electricity a Catholic. I 
believe the religious in

00:26:45.970 --> 00:26:50.066
tolerance will some 
day end said Jack. That is -- 

00:26:50.067 --> 00:26:57.517
that picture is behind it.
    A long hard struggle over 

00:26:57.518 --> 00:26:59.880
civil rights. Civil rights for 
the right 

00:26:59.881 --> 00:27:03.015
of all people to be treated 
fairly without being 

00:27:03.016 --> 00:27:07.569
discriminated against
against. In many places back 

00:27:07.570 --> 00:27:09.936
medium were not treated fairly, 
in the 

00:27:09.937 --> 00:27:15.321
south especially, a thing called
 segregation kept black people 

00:27:15.322 --> 00:27:18.251
from 
white people -- especially the 

00:27:18.252 --> 00:27:20.922
Supreme Court -- it's just down 
the 

00:27:20.923 --> 00:27:25.081
from -- had declareed it illegal
, black people were not allowed 

00:27:25.082 --> 00:27:28.536
to go 
to the same people as white 

00:27:28.537 --> 00:27:31.054
people, they were not allowed to
 eat in 

00:27:31.055 --> 00:27:35.187
the same restaurants or stay in 
the same hotels. They couldn't 

00:27:35.188 --> 00:27:37.020
get the 
same jobs as white people and 

00:27:37.021 --> 00:27:39.144
sometimes they were kept from 
voting.

00:27:39.145 --> 00:27:46.987
    Many Americans like Martin 
Luther chingjunior and other 

00:27:46.988 --> 00:27:50.360
people 
that were not famous, even kids 

00:27:50.361 --> 00:27:53.096
like you guys were frying to 
change 

00:27:53.097 --> 00:27:58.050
that through a peaceful protest.
 Have you ever been to a peace

00:27:58.059 --> 00:28:00.491
ful 
protest? You're already part of 

00:28:00.492 --> 00:28:03.155
history. You're a part of 
history just 

00:28:03.156 --> 00:28:08.431
like the people in this book. 
You're working to change history

00:28:08.583 --> 00:28:11.146
 and 
make history. That's how you 

00:28:11.147 --> 00:28:13.990
make history by being part of it
 and you 

00:28:13.991 --> 00:28:15.991
guys are already doing that.

00:28:19.958 --> 00:28:22.421
The women's March?

00:28:30.628 --> 00:28:33.907
    So we can show Donald Trump

00:28:38.034 --> 00:28:40.034
 we're stronger.

00:28:42.848 --> 00:28:46.540
Love is stronger.
    That's fabulous. So you're 

00:28:46.541 --> 00:28:48.967
part of history. You guys are 
changing 

00:28:48.968 --> 00:28:52.518
history, you're making your 
voices heard and telling people 

00:28:52.519 --> 00:28:55.101
how you 
want our country to be. Good job

00:28:55.255 --> 00:28:58.785
 all of you.
    So here are more kids part 

00:28:58.786 --> 00:29:04.364
of protest. Just a month later 
four 

00:29:04.365 --> 00:29:08.446
College students began a sit in,
 do you know what a sit in is? 

00:29:08.452 --> 00:29:10.879
It's a 
protest when you're sitting to 

00:29:10.880 --> 00:29:13.458
make a statement. So I'll read 
about it

00:29:13.459 --> 00:29:16.696
it.
    They sat quietly and peace

00:29:16.702 --> 00:29:20.678
fully and waited to be serveed, 
they were 

00:29:20.679 --> 00:29:23.970
refused. Every day more and more
 students joined them.

00:29:23.971 --> 00:29:29.108
    By the end of the week the 
it spread across the country --

00:29:37.913 --> 00:29:39.655
 that 
October Martin Luther King was 

00:29:39.656 --> 00:29:45.602
arrested and sent to prison for 
participating in a sit in. His 

00:29:45.603 --> 00:29:48.399
wife Coretta Scott King feared 
he would 

00:29:48.400 --> 00:29:53.099
be killed.
    Some of Jack's advisors 

00:29:53.100 --> 00:29:56.807
worryied it would cost him the 
votes of 

00:29:56.808 --> 00:30:00.940
white people that doesn't 
support civil rights. Do you 

00:30:00.941 --> 00:30:03.787
think that 
stopped him or he wanted to help

00:30:05.752 --> 00:30:09.598
 Martin Luther King.
    If there's anything I can do

00:30:10.462 --> 00:30:13.190
 to help please feel free to 
call on 

00:30:13.191 --> 00:30:15.191
me. He was elected the

00:30:17.989 --> 00:30:19.852
 35th President for the 
eyewitness. Hold onto 

00:30:19.853 --> 00:30:23.163
your thoughts and we'll do 
questions at the end.

00:30:23.164 --> 00:30:33.083
    Some things the President 
acted -- thank you -- some 

00:30:33.084 --> 00:30:36.899
things the 
new President acted quickly and 

00:30:36.900 --> 00:30:40.779
used bold words. He established 
the 

00:30:40.780 --> 00:30:44.437
Peace Corp and challenged young 
Americans to go out in the world

00:30:45.340 --> 00:30:46.467
 and 
work shoulder to shoulder with 

00:30:46.468 --> 00:30:48.835
other countries. The United 
States and 

00:30:48.836 --> 00:30:50.836
the Soviet Union

00:30:52.835 --> 00:31:00.565
 were rivals. The Soviet union 
had sent someone to 

00:31:00.566 --> 00:31:02.798
space. Jack said the United 
States would be the first to 

00:31:02.799 --> 00:31:05.629
have a man 
land on the moon. Among other 

00:31:05.630 --> 00:31:09.912
things, important civil rights 
issues, 

00:31:09.913 --> 00:31:13.887
Jack was slow to act. He once 
declareed that the President 

00:31:13.888 --> 00:31:16.165
must be 
willing to get in the thick of 

00:31:16.166 --> 00:31:19.764
the fight but now he seemed 
unwilling 

00:31:19.765 --> 00:31:24.601
to fight some battles. I would 
like to be patient but patience 

00:31:24.602 --> 00:31:28.039
has 
cost us years in our struggle 

00:31:28.040 --> 00:31:30.040
for human

00:31:31.532 --> 00:31:34.064
 dignity. Others were taking 
action.

00:31:34.065 --> 00:31:40.308
    And that made despite the 
danger hundreds of black 

00:31:40.309 --> 00:31:43.163
children and 
teenagers stood up again and 

00:31:43.164 --> 00:31:47.457
enact the. They left their 
classrooms in 

00:31:47.458 --> 00:31:52.871
Birmingham Alabama and marched 
peacefully, they were hauled off

00:31:53.298 --> 00:31:56.319
 to 
jail. The next day mother people

00:31:56.583 --> 00:31:59.190
 arriveed to take their places. 
In the 

00:31:59.191 --> 00:32:03.431
civil rights movement a lot of 
young people were at the 

00:32:03.432 --> 00:32:05.064
forefront 
saying we have to do something 

00:32:05.065 --> 00:32:07.805
different, we have to make our 
voices 

00:32:07.806 --> 00:32:13.929
heard. Americans including Jack 
saw the downpeople's courage by 

00:32:13.930 --> 00:32:17.308
on the 
news and sickened by the 

00:32:17.309 --> 00:32:23.287
violence.
    On June 11th,two students 

00:32:23.288 --> 00:32:28.539
tried to join the University of 
Alabama, do you think Jack is 

00:32:28.540 --> 00:32:32.525
going to act now? He had to act.
 And 

00:32:32.526 --> 00:32:36.784
finally, following in the 
footsteps of those who have set 

00:32:36.785 --> 00:32:39.507
the course 
by sitting in and sending letter

00:32:40.224 --> 00:32:43.505
s, March be and riding buss he 
did.

00:32:43.506 --> 00:32:51.727
    Jack ordered the national 
guard to escort the children 

00:32:51.728 --> 00:32:53.719
safely into 
school. That night in living 

00:32:53.720 --> 00:32:58.133
rooms and kitchens and dineers 
across the 

00:32:58.134 --> 00:33:03.025
America, millions of people of 
all colors, rich people, poor 

00:33:03.026 --> 00:33:04.829
people, 
people from the North and people

00:33:04.830 --> 00:33:06.515
 from the South, people of 
different 

00:33:06.516 --> 00:33:10.071
religions, people who have 
looked the other way and people 

00:33:10.072 --> 00:33:13.050
who have 
fought for change turned on 

00:33:13.051 --> 00:33:18.350
their television and radios and 
heard the 

00:33:18.351 --> 00:33:20.584
President speak.
    This is some of what he said

00:33:20.739 --> 00:33:28.858
. He said 100 years has delayhas
 past 

00:33:28.859 --> 00:33:32.543
since President Lincoln has 
freed the slaves. This nation 

00:33:32.544 --> 00:33:35.662
will not be 
fully free until all citizens 

00:33:35.663 --> 00:33:40.503
are free. Now the time has come 
for this 

00:33:40.504 --> 00:33:43.909
nation to fulfill its promise 
it's a time to act.

00:33:43.910 --> 00:33:50.252
    So after the speech Martin 
Luther King and the paw baseball

00:33:51.207 --> 00:33:55.287
 player 
Jackie Robinson sent letters 

00:33:55.288 --> 00:33:58.285
good job. The presidential 
statement on 

00:33:58.286 --> 00:34:05.987
the color question is one of the
 -- sometimes they had said

00:34:08.656 --> 00:34:11.783
 they need 
to end segregation but they 

00:34:11.784 --> 00:34:14.519
never said it's totally and 
completely 

00:34:14.520 --> 00:34:19.526
wrong. They made it sound it was
 about politics and Jack Kennedy

00:34:19.632 --> 00:34:20.744
 said 
it's just wrong.

00:34:20.745 --> 00:34:26.370
    The following week he sent a
 strong civil rights bill to 

00:34:26.371 --> 00:34:30.173
Congress.
    So do you think he sent it 

00:34:30.174 --> 00:34:33.303
right across the street to the 
Senate 

00:34:33.304 --> 00:34:36.429
building. You guys are right in 
the place where all of this 

00:34:36.430 --> 00:34:42.381
happened. 
President was killed November 22

00:34:42.382 --> 00:34:45.942
, 1963, just a few months after 
he 

00:34:45.943 --> 00:34:51.198
addressed the nation of civil 
rights but his legacy lives on. 

00:34:51.751 --> 00:34:54.581
Today 
the Soviet Union no longer 

00:34:54.582 --> 00:34:58.735
exists but young Peace Corps 
still go out 

00:34:58.736 --> 00:35:04.207
in the world building bridges, 
libraryies and schools.

00:35:04.208 --> 00:35:11.440
    On July 20, 1969, Kennedy 
space challenge was met, two 

00:35:11.441 --> 00:35:16.104
American 
astronauts walked on the moon. 

00:35:16.158 --> 00:35:22.246
And on July 2, 964 with help of 
many 

00:35:22.247 --> 00:35:24.247
courageous people the civil acts

00:35:27.477 --> 00:35:30.601
 -- civil rights act was enacted
 -- 

00:35:30.602 --> 00:35:35.008
provideing for the integration 
for schools and public places.

00:35:35.009 --> 00:35:41.833
    Hold on one second -- in the
 50 years since the bill was 

00:35:41.834 --> 00:35:44.621
passed 
there's been much progress on 

00:35:44.622 --> 00:35:47.804
civil rights but there's a been 
a step 

00:35:47.805 --> 00:35:52.958
backwards too. History isn't a 
straight line, and it's not 

00:35:52.959 --> 00:35:54.786
written in 
permanent ink. We're changing 

00:35:54.787 --> 00:35:57.055
every day. When you go to 
protest you're 

00:35:57.056 --> 00:36:03.019
changing history. From here on 
out you are the decision makeers

00:36:03.615 --> 00:36:05.548
 Jack 
once told young people. You are 

00:36:05.549 --> 00:36:08.128
the writers of history, so now 
it's 

00:36:08.129 --> 00:36:15.682
your turn to choose your course 
torque speak up, to act, to move

00:36:16.092 --> 00:36:17.646
 the 
world forward, to make history, 

00:36:17.647 --> 00:36:22.192
so kids your age can and have 
made 

00:36:22.193 --> 00:36:26.902
history. Do you guys want to see
 how this story became a book 

00:36:26.903 --> 00:36:28.472
and then 
we'll have time for questions.

00:36:28.473 --> 00:36:33.176
    When I first wrote this, the
 first thing I do is I look for 

00:36:33.177 --> 00:36:38.008
inspiration, you talk about 
where you get your ideas, I get 

00:36:38.009 --> 00:36:40.009
a lot of 
ideas from photographs these are

00:36:40.145 --> 00:36:43.687
 some of the real pictures of 
John F. 

00:36:43.688 --> 00:36:51.133
Kennedy's family, I know you saw
 some family memory beia 

00:36:51.134 --> 00:36:54.360
upstairs -- 
he's right in the middle in the 

00:36:54.361 --> 00:36:57.599
back.
    Even more, as much as I was 

00:36:57.600 --> 00:37:01.054
inspireed by John F. Kennedy I I
 was 

00:37:01.055 --> 00:37:05.143
more inspireed by the people he 
was inspireed by, the people 

00:37:05.144 --> 00:37:08.780
that were 
creating the change, those brave

00:37:08.803 --> 00:37:10.566
 kid that's were showing the 
courage. 

00:37:10.567 --> 00:37:16.132
Who is that?
    Everyone knows -- you guys 

00:37:16.133 --> 00:37:19.166
-- I can't get over this -- they
 are so 

00:37:19.167 --> 00:37:25.503
smart. Yeah, that's Ruby bridges
, she was the first black 

00:37:25.504 --> 00:37:27.312
student in 
elementary school.

00:37:27.313 --> 00:37:31.754
    Why did she have to go to 
the white kids school?

00:37:31.755 --> 00:37:37.778
    She wanted to. She hadn't 
been allowed to. The school 

00:37:37.779 --> 00:37:39.440
that's white 
people went to had better 

00:37:39.441 --> 00:37:42.427
resources, they had more money, 
so she 

00:37:42.428 --> 00:37:49.114
wanted to have the same things 
-- she deserveed just as good 

00:37:49.115 --> 00:37:51.087
and 
education as everyone else right

00:37:51.088 --> 00:37:52.961
?
    That's a very good question.

00:37:52.962 --> 00:37:57.910
    You know, you notice 
sometimes when some people think

00:37:58.051 --> 00:38:00.331
 -- some 
people are worried that they 

00:38:00.332 --> 00:38:03.460
share with people they won't 
have as much

00:38:03.461 --> 00:38:07.459
much, I think if had to do with 
that. Some people felt they want

00:38:07.913 --> 00:38:09.739
ed to 
keep all the good stuff and keep

00:38:09.740 --> 00:38:11.709
 the other people out, and they 
want 

00:38:11.710 --> 00:38:15.571
the all the good stuff. It 
wasn't a fair system. The 

00:38:15.572 --> 00:38:18.233
Supreme Court 
said it wasn't fair. So now we 

00:38:18.234 --> 00:38:20.816
can be together.
    I was also inspireed -- 

00:38:20.817 --> 00:38:24.524
these are some of the real kids 
-- maybe in 

00:38:24.525 --> 00:38:29.068
the March, when the kids left 
their classroom? Here's some of 

00:38:29.069 --> 00:38:31.910
the real 
kid that's marched just like 

00:38:31.911 --> 00:38:33.784
when you guys said you had March
ed 

00:38:33.785 --> 00:38:38.581
recently. And I was inspireed by
 those kids. When I started 

00:38:38.582 --> 00:38:41.163
reading 
about Kennedy, I wanted to write

00:38:41.569 --> 00:38:44.702
 about the kids that inspireed 
him. I 

00:38:44.703 --> 00:38:50.036
started writing and found old 
documents, this is a letter that

00:38:50.070 --> 00:38:51.138
 he 
wrote whether or not he was a 

00:38:51.139 --> 00:38:54.364
little boy. There's a telegram, 
that 

00:38:54.365 --> 00:39:01.087
says my deer boy, and then they 
started writing -- my rough 

00:39:01.088 --> 00:39:03.360
drafts are 
kind of messy -- I don't know in

00:39:03.910 --> 00:39:09.225
 if I should show you? Yeah? 
This is 

00:39:09.226 --> 00:39:10.598
my rough draft for my baseball 
book.

00:39:10.599 --> 00:39:14.289
    If you were in a library and
 you could check out any book 

00:39:14.290 --> 00:39:16.489
you 
wanted how many would get that 

00:39:16.490 --> 00:39:19.709
if you saw it on the shift? Not 
many 

00:39:19.710 --> 00:39:23.097
right?
    What's it missing -- what's 

00:39:23.098 --> 00:39:28.871
it need before it can be a book?
    It's missing pictures,and 

00:39:28.872 --> 00:39:30.872
it's missing

00:39:33.207 --> 00:39:37.598
 a front page.
    It's missing a pictures, a 

00:39:37.599 --> 00:39:41.597
title page, what else?
    It's also missing

00:39:45.320 --> 00:39:48.441
 a title. If it had a title it 
would actually be 

00:39:48.442 --> 00:39:51.109
a book.
    Okay, one more. What does it

00:39:51.113 --> 00:39:54.446
 need before it can be a book?
    A book with

00:39:58.958 --> 00:40:04.764
 -- pictures on it.
    Not all books have pictures.

00:40:04.765 --> 00:40:08.097
 You're absolutely right. It is 
pretty 

00:40:08.098 --> 00:40:12.894
messy. Should we do one more -- 
what were you going to say? It's

00:40:13.770 --> 00:40:14.171
 miss 
ago period.

00:40:14.172 --> 00:40:18.570
    It probably is. I think it's
 missing correct spelling, it's 

00:40:18.571 --> 00:40:24.722
missing pages, it's pretty messy
. So what I do after my first 

00:40:24.723 --> 00:40:27.611
draft I 
revise. What does revise mean? 

00:40:29.812 --> 00:40:33.801
    You do it again. Yeah, so I 
keep working on it to make it 

00:40:33.802 --> 00:40:36.072
better 
and better, and when it's as 

00:40:36.073 --> 00:40:40.174
good as I can possibly make it I
 type it 

00:40:40.175 --> 00:40:45.890
up -- here's a type up version I
 did about a girl scout and then

00:40:46.151 --> 00:40:49.757
 I 
send it to my editor. How many 

00:40:49.758 --> 00:40:55.563
people think my editor will say 
it's 

00:40:55.564 --> 00:40:59.952
perfect and we'll publish it 
just like this? Yes, it's never 

00:40:59.953 --> 00:41:03.085
happened. 
Instead she sends it back to me 

00:41:03.086 --> 00:41:06.569
full of ideas of how I can 
revise it

00:41:13.497 --> 00:41:17.303
back to me.
    And all of those are 

00:41:17.304 --> 00:41:19.031
comments about ways I can make 
the story 

00:41:19.032 --> 00:41:22.867
better. I think in this one the 
only thing she said I could keep

00:41:22.874 --> 00:41:26.114
 was 
the main character's name and 

00:41:26.115 --> 00:41:30.685
that's because is it was non-
fiction. 

00:41:30.686 --> 00:41:34.100
Egg else she wants me to change 
and try to make it better. If 

00:41:34.101 --> 00:41:38.209
we're 
going to make you guys read it 

00:41:38.210 --> 00:41:41.749
we're going to make it good. The
 last 

00:41:41.750 --> 00:41:46.710
thing we do is send it to the I 
will administrator and they do 

00:41:46.711 --> 00:41:49.031
some 
sketches. So that's what the 

00:41:49.032 --> 00:41:52.924
sketches looks like before he 
does the 

00:41:52.925 --> 00:41:57.149
beautiful paintings. Covers, 
they can take a really long time

00:41:57.158 --> 00:42:02.561
. They're 
revised to get stories right, I 

00:42:02.562 --> 00:42:04.502
will administrators revise. 
Here's the 

00:42:04.503 --> 00:42:09.053
art for that. Here's some of 
what Greg Christy did when he 

00:42:09.054 --> 00:42:11.889
was working 
on the cover. Here's what the 

00:42:11.890 --> 00:42:13.604
final cover looks like. So you 
guys can 

00:42:13.605 --> 00:42:16.607
see -- these are some things he 
was experimenting with different

00:42:17.207 --> 00:42:20.899
 ideas
ideas, getting different ideas 

00:42:20.900 --> 00:42:23.023
downMaybe he was thinking maybe 
we 

00:42:23.024 --> 00:42:26.709
should have Kennedy walking to 
the podium?

00:42:26.710 --> 00:42:34.079
    All these different ideas --
 when we're talking about these 

00:42:34.080 --> 00:42:36.578
we had 
a thought. It's great to see 

00:42:36.579 --> 00:42:39.878
Kennedy in these but what was 
Kennedy's 

00:42:39.879 --> 00:42:47.342
big inspiration, who inspireed 
Kennedy. Who inspireed Kennedy? 

00:42:47.750 --> 00:42:54.447
Who made 
I am give his speech? Martin 

00:42:54.448 --> 00:43:00.389
Luther King, and also who else?
    And also the kids. But 

00:43:00.390 --> 00:43:04.922
you're right, they said you need
 to do more 

00:43:04.923 --> 00:43:09.097
and they were met by violent and
 he thought if they can do it we

00:43:09.354 --> 00:43:10.209
 have 
to do something.

00:43:10.210 --> 00:43:16.511
    So our Grege Christy thought
 the kids need to be on the 

00:43:16.512 --> 00:43:18.869
front 
cover too because they're 

00:43:18.870 --> 00:43:23.180
important as Kennedy, at least.
    The time cover, he brought 

00:43:23.181 --> 00:43:28.022
the real kids, and he worked 
them into 

00:43:28.023 --> 00:43:31.560
the illustration. The thing that
 makes you do something.

00:43:31.561 --> 00:43:37.691
    That was Kennedy's 
inspiration. And everything I 

00:43:37.692 --> 00:43:40.815
was going to tell 
you guys about today -- do you 

00:43:40.816 --> 00:43:44.052
guys have questions for me? Yes 
yes, 

00:43:44.053 --> 00:43:47.504
questions?
    Why did -- if you were 

00:43:47.505 --> 00:43:56.757
making a -- good question.
    That's a a

00:43:58.020 --> 00:44:02.112
 -- artists they always can make
 their decisions on what 

00:44:02.113 --> 00:44:06.112
they think looks the best. I 
think -- if you put words on it,

00:44:06.113 --> 00:44:10.365
 it might 
distract from the title. Good 

00:44:10.366 --> 00:44:12.238
question.
    Yeah?

00:44:12.239 --> 00:44:21.917
    So I kind of have an answer 
-- so, maybe -- maybe

00:44:22.906 --> 00:44:28.027
 the back of the 
slide was actually supposeed to 

00:44:28.028 --> 00:44:30.309
be belly paper.
    We could be looking at the 

00:44:30.310 --> 00:44:32.562
back of the sign there. That's a
 good 

00:44:32.563 --> 00:44:38.530
thought.
    Okay. We'll come back. Yeah?

00:44:38.531 --> 00:44:45.213
    Why did he -- did he have a 
funeral? Kennedy? Yeah, he did. 

00:44:45.507 --> 00:44:47.945
When 
he died, it was in November, the

00:44:48.190 --> 00:44:51.963
 same thing he gave the speech, 
he had 

00:44:51.964 --> 00:44:54.769
a big funeral.
    Any other questions?

00:44:54.770 --> 00:45:00.897
    To write this book?
    I was interested in writing 

00:45:00.898 --> 00:45:02.857
about Kennedy because I knew it 
was 

00:45:02.858 --> 00:45:08.792
his 100est birthday, but I knew 
he was President during the 

00:45:08.793 --> 00:45:09.686
civil 
rights movement and I didn't 

00:45:09.687 --> 00:45:13.720
know what his involvement was. I
 had read 

00:45:13.721 --> 00:45:17.943
those two parts of history 
separately, I read about Kennedy

00:45:18.100 --> 00:45:22.183
, and I 
read about the sit in and Ruby 

00:45:22.184 --> 00:45:24.910
bridges, I thought what he was 
doing -- 

00:45:24.911 --> 00:45:29.732
he was the President and had to 
be involved in. So I thought to 

00:45:29.733 --> 00:45:31.863
do 
research and see what he was 

00:45:31.864 --> 00:45:38.424
doing. Good question. Yes?
    What do I like in the book 

00:45:38.425 --> 00:45:41.872
about Kennedy? My favorite piece
 of art

00:45:41.873 --> 00:45:46.362
art, it's not here, it's a piece
 of art with all the kid kids 

00:45:46.363 --> 00:45:49.442
watching 
television. I find that powerful

00:45:49.501 --> 00:45:53.650
, you see kids all over, some 
from the 

00:45:53.651 --> 00:45:58.186
South, some from the North, and 
I thought it must be powerful 

00:45:58.187 --> 00:46:00.206
for a 
President to stand up to 

00:46:00.207 --> 00:46:01.584
something that you know is right
.

00:46:01.585 --> 00:46:07.169
    The book that Kennedy wrote 
called profile and courage about

00:46:07.426 --> 00:46:10.696
 brave 
people, there are awards, and 

00:46:10.697 --> 00:46:14.237
they just gave them out this 
past week. 

00:46:14.238 --> 00:46:21.680
Guess who got the profile and 
courage award? This year it went

00:46:21.689 --> 00:46:26.473
 to 
President President Obama -- he 

00:46:26.474 --> 00:46:29.301
was your favorite President? You
 can 

00:46:29.302 --> 00:46:33.155
hear his speech. He talked about
 Kennedy, which was neat.

00:46:33.156 --> 00:46:42.406
    He is very famous. Yes?
    How come Luther King got 

00:46:42.407 --> 00:46:45.688
shot -- 
    It didn't end right away. It

00:46:45.943 --> 00:46:48.930
 ended with the civil rights, 
and 

00:46:48.931 --> 00:46:53.488
before the civil right acts 
there was a supreme course case 

00:46:53.489 --> 00:46:56.624
that said 
there shouldn't be segregation. 

00:46:56.924 --> 00:46:59.750
History can take a long time. 
Change 

00:46:59.751 --> 00:47:04.163
happens slowly. We want it to 
happen faster but change happens

00:47:04.459 --> 00:47:06.459
 slowly.

00:47:11.442 --> 00:47:15.538
It would be nice if it ended 
right away. I think you have to 

00:47:15.539 --> 00:47:18.269
keep 
working for things because 

00:47:18.270 --> 00:47:22.207
sometimes it's like we can relax
 and think 

00:47:22.208 --> 00:47:28.647
something is all done. They've 
gone forward but we slide 

00:47:28.648 --> 00:47:30.648
backwards too
too, so we have to keep marching

00:47:31.064 --> 00:47:33.045
 and keep protesting for things 
we 

00:47:33.046 --> 00:47:40.034
believe in. Yes?
    Why did the guy shoot him in

00:47:40.035 --> 00:47:41.426
 the fairest place -- Kennedy or

00:47:41.427 --> 00:47:43.433
Martin Luther King? 

00:47:47.092 --> 00:47:49.092
You meant Kennedy?

00:47:52.519 --> 00:47:56.201
I think -- I honestly don't know
. I think he didn't agree with 

00:47:56.202 --> 00:48:00.910
them.
    He -- I think a lot of times

00:48:01.615 --> 00:48:03.341
 -- it's dangerous being a 
President. 

00:48:03.342 --> 00:48:08.591
That's why President's have 
secret service. Have you seen 

00:48:08.592 --> 00:48:12.269
secret 
service? Yeah, they do a lot 

00:48:12.270 --> 00:48:14.267
more safety things like they use
ed to do. 

00:48:14.268 --> 00:48:18.753
They don't have open cars and 
stuff so the President can be a 

00:48:18.754 --> 00:48:22.660
little 
safer. If you have concerns to 

00:48:22.661 --> 00:48:25.789
peacefully protest versus 
violence. Yes

00:48:25.790 --> 00:48:29.081
Yes?
    I know that -- so, when I 

00:48:29.082 --> 00:48:31.082
saw a picture,

00:48:33.654 --> 00:48:37.811
 I thought -- I knew it 
was going to be like that 

00:48:37.812 --> 00:48:43.597
because the book in the red 
writing, it says 

00:48:43.598 --> 00:48:48.139
John F. Kennedy's big speech.
    It does say that.

00:48:48.140 --> 00:48:52.546
    So -- I'll tell you a few 
behind the scenes thing about 

00:48:52.547 --> 00:48:55.546
that 
picture. When we first saw the 

00:48:55.547 --> 00:48:56.954
paintings it was all in color, 
and 

00:48:56.955 --> 00:49:02.067
that's something the artist 
revised, what do you guys know 

00:49:02.068 --> 00:49:04.804
about 
television from a long time ago?

00:49:04.805 --> 00:49:09.150
 Yeah, a lot of TVs were black 
and 

00:49:09.151 --> 00:49:14.161
white. So he had to go back and 
change the art. That probably 

00:49:14.162 --> 00:49:16.162
wouldn't 
have been in color. And we did a

00:49:16.978 --> 00:49:20.720
 lot of the title, a time to act
 comes 

00:49:20.721 --> 00:49:24.817
from the speech he gave, and we 
debateed it should be John F. 

00:49:24.818 --> 00:49:31.504
Kennedy O 
J FK's big speech because a lot 

00:49:31.505 --> 00:49:34.630
of people called him J FK -- 
what 

00:49:34.631 --> 00:49:39.038
would you guys have done? Fit 
Gerald -- yes.

00:49:39.039 --> 00:49:41.771
    Back then, he was

00:49:45.707 --> 00:49:50.408
 invented -- 
    It was invented --

00:49:50.409 --> 00:49:54.722
    &gt;&gt; 
    I saw real life TV way back 

00:49:54.723 --> 00:49:56.723
then and

00:49:58.554 --> 00:50:03.501
 --
    That is really brave, a lot 

00:50:03.502 --> 00:50:06.509
of people did brave water things
 some 

00:50:06.510 --> 00:50:11.962
TV was just invented. A lot of 
people listen to it on the radio

00:50:13.168 --> 00:50:16.703
and they didn't have the 
Internet. You 

00:50:16.704 --> 00:50:20.708
can actually watch the speech. 
You can go online and your 

00:50:20.709 --> 00:50:24.558
teacher can 
find it, you can watch videos on

00:50:24.559 --> 00:50:30.522
 this speech. It's on my website
 or 

00:50:30.523 --> 00:50:33.954
the J FK library.
    All not all the people that 

00:50:33.955 --> 00:50:36.077
helped our country is black, not
 all 

00:50:36.078 --> 00:50:38.351
of them.
    You're right. There were 

00:50:38.352 --> 00:50:40.633
white people and other people 
that helped 

00:50:40.634 --> 00:50:45.035
too, allyies.
    Yes? Of if I know the last 

00:50:45.036 --> 00:50:47.706
name of the person who killed 
John F. 

00:50:47.707 --> 00:50:55.311
Kennedy. His last name is Oswald
. You're right. 

00:50:55.312 --> 00:51:00.970
    What month was his funeral?
    You know, he died in 

00:51:00.971 --> 00:51:04.670
November, November 22nd, I don't
 off hand 

00:51:04.671 --> 00:51:09.222
know the date of his funeral but
 I bet it was still November.

00:51:12.743 --> 00:51:18.538
Is it the one the four friends 
-- I love that book. That's a 

00:51:18.539 --> 00:51:21.212
wonderful book. There are 
wonderful books about the sit in

00:51:21.213 --> 00:51:24.127
s. Yeah, 
there's a wonderful book about 

00:51:24.128 --> 00:51:27.816
the -- there's several wonderful
 books 

00:51:27.817 --> 00:51:33.696
about Martin King -- there are 
Self-wonderful books about Ruby 

00:51:33.697 --> 00:51:36.929
King -- 
she wrote some kid's books. I 

00:51:36.930 --> 00:51:40.358
don't know if you kids get to 
read books 

00:51:40.359 --> 00:51:44.774
after. Are they reading books? I
 bet you'll have a lot of these 

00:51:44.775 --> 00:51:46.472
bookbooks 
in your school.

00:51:46.473 --> 00:51:55.707
    Did the person who got -- 
who killed J F Kennedy, did he 

00:51:55.708 --> 00:51:56.232
get hang
hanged?

00:51:56.233 --> 00:52:03.130
    That's a good thought. He 
was shot. Someone --

00:52:03.131 --> 00:52:07.682
    You guys know about Kennedy 
--

00:52:07.683 --> 00:52:10.818
    Who killed Oswald?

00:52:19.794 --> 00:52:24.710
Jack rubey. And there's things 
about that too. So this book is 

00:52:24.711 --> 00:52:29.915
about Kennedy and civil rights 
but there's a lot of great book 

00:52:29.916 --> 00:52:32.409
that's 
talked about his assassination, 

00:52:32.410 --> 00:52:36.256
some picture books.

00:52:41.499 --> 00:52:43.528
Yes.
    Yes.

00:52:43.529 --> 00:52:52.755
    The person who killed J F 
Kennedy and the person who shot 

00:52:52.756 --> 00:52:55.208
the 
President shot the -- who shot 

00:52:55.209 --> 00:52:59.461
that person?
    It was a really intense time

00:52:59.469 --> 00:53:04.429
. It was all -- no, I don't 
believe it 

00:53:04.430 --> 00:53:06.541
happened all in the same day.

00:53:09.787 --> 00:53:13.217
When was this book made?
    This book -- good question 

00:53:13.218 --> 00:53:16.202
-- it just came out last month. 
It was 

00:53:16.203 --> 00:53:19.603
just published but I really 
wrote it last year because it 

00:53:19.604 --> 00:53:23.262
takes a long 
time for the ill administrator 

00:53:23.263 --> 00:53:26.507
gets to their work after it's 
already 

00:53:26.508 --> 00:53:29.000
written so I wrote it and then 
it went to the I will 

00:53:29.001 --> 00:53:29.709
administrator. 
Yes?

00:53:29.710 --> 00:53:32.707
    When did

00:53:35.848 --> 00:53:37.848
 the

00:53:38.975 --> 00:53:42.813
 segregation end?
    Good question. So I believe 

00:53:42.814 --> 00:53:51.361
-- what were you going to say --
    When did slavery end. 

00:53:56.311 --> 00:54:02.226
1859 -- 
    We celebrate on the 4th of 

00:54:02.227 --> 00:54:05.416
July because that's when our 
first 

00:54:05.417 --> 00:54:10.672
attendance was wrote. You're 
right -- George Washington was 

00:54:10.673 --> 00:54:14.089
in the 
revolution air war and was the 

00:54:14.090 --> 00:54:19.626
first President.
    So I think segregation, it 

00:54:19.627 --> 00:54:24.887
took longer to actually end to 
when it 

00:54:24.888 --> 00:54:30.594
became I legal.
    So we kind of noticed 

00:54:30.595 --> 00:54:34.284
there's a Paul person Paul 
revere -- I know 

00:54:34.285 --> 00:54:38.190
about a person named Paul revere
 too.

00:54:43.380 --> 00:54:47.629
It's part of American history, 
and he has to do with the 

00:54:47.630 --> 00:54:48.642
American 
revolution too.

00:54:48.643 --> 00:54:54.197
    Yes?
    Good question. So right now 

00:54:54.198 --> 00:54:56.198
I'm write ago book about

00:54:59.771 --> 00:55:01.771
 Michelle 
observe. 

00:55:04.728 --> 00:55:06.728
 Obama. Was the person that kill
ed

00:55:09.820 --> 00:55:14.822
 J FK arrested? Yes. You guys 
have been a wonderful audience 

00:55:14.823 --> 00:55:16.648
with fabulous questions and 
answer. Can
