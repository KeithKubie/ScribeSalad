1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:04,260
Because if you don't get fed that you
don't find out about Julian Assange

2
00:00:04,261 --> 00:00:07,080
getting kicked out of
the embassy in London,

3
00:00:07,110 --> 00:00:10,380
you don't find out about a million
different stories that are in the news.

4
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:13,640
It's a fun story. It's a cool story,
but do I need to know it? Wow.

5
00:00:14,630 --> 00:00:18,140
It's a fun story. That's a
quote for you from now on. Hey,

6
00:00:18,141 --> 00:00:22,490
what about Shalina such Tom Papa,
hands up in quotes. It's a fun story.

7
00:00:22,491 --> 00:00:26,870
It's a cool story, but I don't
need to know it. Holy Shit. Really?

8
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:31,850
You just redefined white privilege.
Well, you hit it. You hit it on the head.

9
00:00:31,851 --> 00:00:34,370
Let it off fire. No, it's seriously.

10
00:00:34,371 --> 00:00:38,210
What can I do about a lot
of these? You know, look,

11
00:00:38,211 --> 00:00:41,030
I think it's good that the information
is flowing and that moves everybody

12
00:00:41,031 --> 00:00:42,800
forward, but you know, for me,

13
00:00:42,801 --> 00:00:46,370
sitting in there trying to tell some
jokes and feed my kids, it's like,

14
00:00:46,730 --> 00:00:50,000
do I need to know everything,
every trouble spot going around the world.

15
00:00:50,001 --> 00:00:51,650
It's like,
that is a very good question.

16
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:56,040
How much responsibility do you have to
be tuned in to all the events of the

17
00:00:56,041 --> 00:01:00,510
world and to act? Or how
much responsibility do you
have outside of voting?

18
00:01:00,511 --> 00:01:02,070
And do you have the
responsibility to vote?

19
00:01:02,071 --> 00:01:05,850
Cause there's some people that are very
interesting people that don't vote. Yeah.

20
00:01:05,910 --> 00:01:09,100
You know, I don't agree with that. Yeah.

21
00:01:09,830 --> 00:01:12,960
I want to participate.
I understand that. Um,

22
00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:16,440
but I don't think Michael Malice
votes doesn't, he does it.

23
00:01:16,441 --> 00:01:20,520
Didn't he say he doesn't vote?
I think he said he doesn't,

24
00:01:21,470 --> 00:01:23,970
I forget his reasoning,
but it was very logical.

25
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:26,860
Uh Huh. No, I understand
the argument, but I am,

26
00:01:26,870 --> 00:01:29,570
even if it seems kind of false and I just,

27
00:01:29,571 --> 00:01:32,450
I think it kind of like mentally
engages you in the world.

28
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:35,860
It's like you should be
trying to participate. I think

29
00:01:35,950 --> 00:01:40,900
his perspective is that as I'm
a commentator on the world,

30
00:01:40,930 --> 00:01:45,930
that'd be better off if he didn't
actually vote and just look at it how he

31
00:01:46,181 --> 00:01:49,280
really sees it on both sides.
Right.

32
00:01:49,330 --> 00:01:51,220
If I'm just not sure arcial yeah,

33
00:01:51,250 --> 00:01:53,530
I'm sure I'm butchering
the way he would phrase it.

34
00:01:53,890 --> 00:01:56,980
I think it's in the spirit
of that. Yeah. If you vote,

35
00:01:56,981 --> 00:01:58,930
you don't have a right to complain.

36
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:05,760
All right. Does it make sense?
That doesn't make any sense.

37
00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:12,040
That was deep. Well, but I think,
uh, but look, it's, it's a lot.

38
00:02:12,430 --> 00:02:15,190
Look,
I think it's trying to be a good person.

39
00:02:15,191 --> 00:02:18,760
I'm just a person level and try and take
care of your family and work hard and

40
00:02:18,761 --> 00:02:21,070
be good with people and
help your community.

41
00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:24,880
That's kind of the extent of what you
can do and hopefully that spreads out.

42
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:28,870
But you know, Julian Assange. Okay,

43
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:35,350
Whoa, really? I mean, why
is that? You know? Well,

44
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:38,140
like all those people that we're talking
about at that generation that only got

45
00:02:38,141 --> 00:02:41,170
news during that six o'clock hour,
you know,

46
00:02:41,171 --> 00:02:46,171
were they less citizens of the world
because they only got that little dose?

47
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:49,320
I don't know.
They were less informed.

48
00:02:49,410 --> 00:02:52,470
And the idea is that more people can get
away with things they shouldn't be able

49
00:02:52,471 --> 00:02:55,390
to get away with. Like what's happening
right now with Juliana, sarge,

50
00:02:55,770 --> 00:02:59,980
Julian Assange in anybody's estimation.
If look at what he did,

51
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:05,280
he distributed information
that was extremely interesting
to most people in the

52
00:03:05,441 --> 00:03:10,330
world that didn't know about it.
Right. Exposed a lot of scary shit.

53
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:14,770
Yeah. I suppose a lot of corruption
as opposed a lot of, um, I mean, what,

54
00:03:14,771 --> 00:03:17,980
what corruption did it expose? I know
it exposed the, there was that, um,

55
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,400
collateral murder video that was the,

56
00:03:21,490 --> 00:03:25,650
one of the first ones where they
showed them shooting. They shot at um,

57
00:03:26,170 --> 00:03:29,230
these guys where they thought
were soldiers and they were,

58
00:03:29,530 --> 00:03:34,080
they were reporters and it was sort
of just the way they dealt with it.

59
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:38,440
It was very scary for people watching
that someone could just like dehumanize

60
00:03:38,441 --> 00:03:42,160
accidentally killing the wrong people.
I may get like knows the military,

61
00:03:42,190 --> 00:03:44,050
they were making it like, you know, hey,

62
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:48,220
but you kind of have to be in that
mindset to be able to gun people down from

63
00:03:48,221 --> 00:03:50,620
the sky in the first place.
Oh look,

64
00:03:50,650 --> 00:03:54,160
you gotta put yourself in the perspective
of someone who has to do that job and

65
00:03:54,161 --> 00:03:55,450
you take a regular person.

66
00:03:55,630 --> 00:03:59,500
And then you train them to do that job
and then you asked them to go and pull

67
00:03:59,501 --> 00:04:02,750
the trigger people, they're going to
develop a coldness to them will again,

68
00:04:03,070 --> 00:04:05,230
they have to, right. But to see it.

69
00:04:05,380 --> 00:04:10,380
So what Julian Assange did is he showed
it to us and then he released all sorts

70
00:04:11,201 --> 00:04:12,880
of, I mean, I, I've, I haven't,

71
00:04:12,910 --> 00:04:16,870
I'm embarrassed to say that I haven't
really studied all the files and what was

72
00:04:16,871 --> 00:04:21,100
released, what wasn't. Apparently
when Ben Shapiro was here,

73
00:04:21,101 --> 00:04:24,760
he said that, uh, people's
names got a put out.

74
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:28,420
Apparently that was someone hacked into
wikileaks and release that information

75
00:04:28,630 --> 00:04:32,170
before they could redact the names.
This was the,

76
00:04:32,171 --> 00:04:36,730
this is what I've been told by multiple
sources. But again, I didn't look into it.

77
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:38,860
I don't know if that was correct.
So

78
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:42,680
they're going to say that he
was treasonous or that he was,

79
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,560
I don't know what they're going to say.
I think you're right.

80
00:04:44,630 --> 00:04:47,900
The first thing was a sex charge.
That's what they were trying to say.

81
00:04:47,901 --> 00:04:49,590
That he had sex with a woman,
um,

82
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:53,000
that where he wore a condom
and then they had sex.

83
00:04:53,180 --> 00:04:57,170
And then they had sex in the morning
with no condom and she didn't consent to

84
00:04:57,171 --> 00:04:59,920
that, that he just kinda did it or
something. I think it was something along,

85
00:04:59,980 --> 00:05:04,910
I think they called it Soprise sex and
if I'm butchering this, I'm sorry. Um,

86
00:05:04,940 --> 00:05:06,800
but the um,

87
00:05:07,130 --> 00:05:10,790
that didn't make sense like that there
would be going after him that way.

88
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:13,280
Well,
he goes obviously not about that.

89
00:05:13,850 --> 00:05:16,880
You go after if you want to get somebody
to go after him and for whatever.

90
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:21,320
But I'm like hacking charges
now, right? Yeah. I don't know.

91
00:05:21,380 --> 00:05:24,560
I know he look crazy in
the, in the embassy, right.

92
00:05:24,561 --> 00:05:28,160
He w he wouldn't clean up after his
cat and he was riding a scooter around.

93
00:05:28,161 --> 00:05:31,110
Is that true? That's what I don't know
why? Well, who knows what's driving? No,

94
00:05:31,111 --> 00:05:31,790
that's part of it.

95
00:05:31,790 --> 00:05:34,940
But that's just part of the little
story that I caught the little delta was

96
00:05:34,980 --> 00:05:39,980
soccer was poetically describing what
the embassy was smelled like with Julian

97
00:05:40,230 --> 00:05:44,620
Assange. Dirty cat shit wafting
through the halls. Yeah. Crazy asshole.

98
00:05:44,650 --> 00:05:47,030
Do you have staying here?
Don't leave.

99
00:05:47,031 --> 00:05:49,960
Pamela Anderson comes over every now
and then they get their free con,

100
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:51,340
the surveillance footage,
footage

101
00:05:51,340 --> 00:05:55,030
of Julian Assan skateboarding in the
Ecuadorian embassy in London has been

102
00:05:55,070 --> 00:05:59,960
linked. Okay. Yeah. But here's the thing,
man. Like what do you want the guy to do?

103
00:05:59,961 --> 00:06:04,250
Is there a problem? He's there for seven
fucking years. He must have gotten crazy.

104
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:08,270
I mean, that's like being, you know,
under house arrest dude. I mean,

105
00:06:08,271 --> 00:06:11,030
it's amazing that he lasted
that long and what they did,

106
00:06:11,031 --> 00:06:14,480
they waited them out and then when there
were never going to wait him out and he

107
00:06:14,481 --> 00:06:17,300
was gonna stay in there forever
and then I guess got sick of them,

108
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:21,890
they just get sick of them. I think there
was also of the Ecuadorian President,

109
00:06:22,490 --> 00:06:26,990
I think he took a photograph in front
of a, like some lobsters and shit.

110
00:06:27,710 --> 00:06:32,450
And it was from a leaked email in
that photo got out and it was very

111
00:06:32,451 --> 00:06:37,451
embarrassing to him because his country's
in deep financial crisis and he's

112
00:06:37,551 --> 00:06:41,690
chilling in some four seasons somewhere.
He loves Terrian lobster.
