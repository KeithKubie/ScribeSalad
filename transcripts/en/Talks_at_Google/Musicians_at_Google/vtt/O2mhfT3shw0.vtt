00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Hello. This is Jongshin Yoon. 

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
This is an interesting scene. Can I capture this?  

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:48.000
I know you are caught up with busy schedule in these days. Thanks for sparing your time for us today. How have you been? 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:54.000
I have had repetitive routine for the last decade pretty much.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:13.000
Monthly Project Yoon Jong Shin, company works, TV shows and a bit of parenting jobs·This is what I have been doing for last 10 years.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:29.000
I was connected to you via Youtube by subscribing Monthly Project Yoon Jong Shin. You just began a solo broadcast titled as Talgokki (Music Thresher).

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:35.000
Could you please briefly walk us through since some of us might be familiar with it?

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:59.000
Initially, Talgokki was meant to update new release from Monthly Project Yoon Jong Shin.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:17.000
After three years of archiving musical contents, I reached to the point where I cannot talk about Talgokki without addressing the Monthly Project.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:40.000
Musicians tend to release new albums once in one or two years, hoping that it would make a big hit in 2-3 weeks.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:48.000
That pattern was pretty common among the musicians during 90s and early 2000s.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:54.000
Some succeeded while the others did not and they lived up their career with a few hits.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:08.000
Chances of me making continuous hits lowered with diversified taste of listeners, which made me quite anxious as a musician in 40s.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:20.000
Then I realized that marketing myself once in several years wishing for jackpot is critically risky to a creator.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:27.000
I declared myself to release new music on a consistent basis regardless of its public success.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000
That is how I ended up kicking off Monthly Project Yoon Jong Shin in 2010.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:41.000
I announced to release a new music every month whether the public likes it or not, which might sound hysterical.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:47.000
I thought it was straightforward, rather than being strategic.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:56.000
I came to realize how much archiving can provide after consistently doing it for three years.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:09.000
It taught me the power of consistency during both busy and non-busy times.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:15.000
I did not find the power of my monthly project while I was doing it.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:29.000
After three years, I started to talk about it in TV shows to give the public awareness.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:39.000
Then they visit my Youtube channel and end up finding 30+ songs and add them on their playlist.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:45.000
This leads to introducing a bulk of my new releases under the Project to music websites.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:55.000
They are easy to be categorized. In fact, Monthly Project Yoon Jong Shin is a new category.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:05:00.000
I kept doing it and it passed 10 years now.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:09.000
I believe last August released the 100th song under the Project.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:19.000
Some made big hits while other did not, but it did not matter.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:29.000
Because Monthly Project Yoon Jong Shin itself has gained attractions and the public started to wonder how I can possibly release new song every month.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:39.000
Then I thought it might worth capturing how I produce my music ? from inspiration to output. That is how Talgokki started.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:49.000
I divided my own video recording into several video clips and upload them in Talgokki channel.

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:59.000
I started with music and it ended up creating another video contents.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:12.000
I started Talgokki hoping to compose music for someone far away from me.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:18.000
My initial plan was to make music for Bruno Mars whom I have never met before.

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:26.000
Making music by all means and deliver it to Bruno Mars. That was my goal.

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:39.000
Bruno Mars was literally too far away so I decided start off to make viral in Korea first then move on.

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:52.000
I can contact BTS by a call, but I decided to come up with music for BTS first since they are a global figure.

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:56.000
Actually, I have never been in contact with BTSs agent.

00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:06.000
They are already global figure and in my mind, they are not easy to be reached.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:14.000
So I started to make music for BTS and uploaded videos clips that captures the process in Talgokki.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:34.000
Thankfully, BTS fans enjoyed watching them and Talgokki has now gained publicity.

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:47.000
Ed Sheeran is up next after BTS episode. I am going to make music for Ed Sheeran whether he likes it or not.

00:07:47.000 --> 00:08:05.000
Talgokki shares how I get inspirations for my target musicians, come up with musical contents and complete songs.

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:17.000
Creation seems to be unattainable process if you only view the end result.

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:26.000
I wanted to share with the public that it is an interesting process in fact, the way to come up with inspiration is not too difficult.

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:35.000
The videos have fun parts also. That is pretty much what Talgokki is about.

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:53.000
Talgokki seems to be a combination of music, education and variety show and you introduce yourself as half-century old Youtuber. How is it like being a Youtube creator?

00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:10.000
Although being consistent is crucial as a Youtuber, it is not easy to consistently upload new contents as a part-time Youtuber.

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:15.000
You know I also have other things to do. I try to live up to my promise though.

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:37.000
I feel attracted to Youtube as a platform in these days because it provides borderless exposure, enabling unlimited possibility.

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:47.000
It sometimes can be a downside. Anyway, well-made contents can easily be shared on a broader basis.

00:09:47.000 --> 00:10:01.000
I think it is about being consistent rather than all-in concept. Youtube should be a part of your life.

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:16.000
I can easily create new contents simply with a smartphone these days and Youtube enables it.

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:35.000
Youtube recognizes my tastes because recommended videos are increasingly fall under my preferences.

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:43.000
I have pets at home and I watch Kang Hyung Wook (reputable pet trainer) videos.

00:10:43.000 --> 00:11:08.000
Youtube keeps throwing new contents at me and I kept watching them. I am watching way too much National Geographic channel these days.

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:27.000
It is scary on the other hand. It began with 10 or 20 minutes and ends up with 2 hours.

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:36.000
You are Youtube creator and active user as well.

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:50.000
I have to be a user to be able to create new contents. I never knew until I launched Talgokki.

00:11:50.000 --> 00:12:00.000
I typically work with two staffs to create videos and I understand why they come up with sensational thumbnails.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:08.000
I never knew I made that kind of face while recording it and I also learn from vocabularies that choose.

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:19.000
You need to get the viewers immersed in the beginning for more clicks.

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:28.000
All these things I learned after the age of 50 and that is even more interesting.

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:43.000
Listen carefully Youtube dreamers. You gotta love the platform first and sensational thumbnails come afterwards.

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:47.000
Thumbnails should be catchy. Thumbnails that don﹑t catch attention are functionless.

00:12:53.000 --> 00:13:00.000
Love the platform first then thumbnails.

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:07.000
Let us move one to the next topic music. You have been a musician over 30 years.

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:10.000
It is rare to find someone committed to a single field for a period of time.

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:22.000
I bet you have experienced dynamic changes in Korean music history. What is the most memorable and mean the most to you?

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:31.000
I was born in 1969 and made a debut in 1989.

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:47.000
I am very fortunate to have experienced 90s as a musician because when the market boomed.

00:13:47.000 --> 00:14:01.000
In 90s, people would find the way to listen to my music as long as I made good music. SBS did not even exist at my debut.

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:08.000
Am I too old-fashioned? There were only KBS and MBC.

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:31.000
If you are well rated by them and some radio channels, you did not need to much worry for 6 to 12 months because selling 1~2 millions of album was doable.

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:42.000
At that time, your album didn't have to be top rated. 30th, 40th, or even 100th ranked album had their own market.

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:53.000
Korean music market in 90s was renaissance where musician in many different kinds all prospered.

00:14:53.000 --> 00:15:10.000
Chronically, it was followed by 1988 Seoul Olympics with economic prosperity. People could afford to spend more in music.

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:18.000
Musicians during that time were able to face different audiences.

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:43.000
Moving in to late 90s and 00s, musical tastes became further diversified, triggering even more explosive music such as H.O.T.

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:57.000
I saw and experienced how teenaged fans reacted to the birth of new kind of music. MP3 was another big change to name one.

00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:01.000
Some might now know what MP3 is

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:10.000
Illegal music downloads or MP3. I thought they will destroy us. That happened in 1998 and 1999.

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:28.000
In mid 2000s, we were able to fight back and illegal music streaming started to decrease replaced by multiple platforms.

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:37.000
I kicked-off Monthly Project Yoon Jong Shin in 2010, but it almost took 3-4 years to turn my consideration into action.

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:52.000
For example back in 90s, I spent two years to make new album, which normally would stay in the market for next 6-12 months.

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:54.000
So I marketed them pretty hard.

00:16:54.000 --> 00:17:16.000
However in nowadays? If I release new album in online music streaming website and doesn't go viral within a week, that is it.

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:41.000
I sensed a big change here. I thought I need to change the way to market and disperse my contents.

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:57.000
One of the big advantages that these platforms can provide is that it gives me an idea of diverse tastes of the public.

00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:10.000
Previously, I thought everyone likes my music if my album is sold more than 1 million copies.

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:21.000
I do not appreciate the term the National Singer. Cho Yong Pil does not represent Korea.

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:27.000
He is the best to his fans. But we always have mistakenly related the top ranked singer to as the most beloved singer in the nation.

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:32.000
But that is such an illusion. Some might like some might not. People all have different preferences.

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:44.000
Being loved and supported by 10-15% of the population makes you a celebrity, not National Singer.

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:51.000
I was unaware of this until platforms exposed what people actually like and how diversified they are.

00:18:51.000 --> 00:19:11.000
I assumed it would be mostly females who watch contents on the platforms, but it turns out that males are slightly more engaged·.about 51-52%

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:18.000
The emergence of different platforms was groundbreaking for us.

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:24.000
Platforms help me view things objectively based on data.

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:36.000
I thought I did not have much female fans because I do not see them much at my concerts, but it was not the case. 

00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:45.000
I realized that I had been mistaken over 20 years during my career.

00:19:45.000 --> 00:20:05.000
Although I was happy because the misunderstanding, data clearly tells me that my music is most beloved by pessimistic males.

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:25.000
This is a big progress to every artist because in old days, we just bought CDs without having to provide emails.

00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:35.000
I never did research on my customer data.

00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:48.000
I could have done if I was determined, but I never thought that accumulated data would provide something this valuable.

00:20:48.000 --> 00:21:05.000
It was crucial for me how to react when I realized that I had been deluded by my fan group over 20 years of my musical career

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:23.000
Musicians in next generations should be able to identify who like their music or not.

00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:32.000
One thing in music thou. Knowing my customer base and having them engaged are different things.

00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:46.000
That is how I started my Monthly Project, creating my own behavioral patterns.

00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:56.000
Changes come with crisis, but you can turn them into new opportunities depending on how you view them.

00:21:56.000 --> 00:22:05.000
In your case, I think you had insights to turn them into opportunity.

00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:10.000
I told you that I don﹑t have much insights.

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:16.000
Like I said earlier, I had to do whatever it takes and I was fortunate that things worked out.

00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:25.000
I was a musician at early 40s at that time and my career as a musical artist was going down hills.

00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:29.000
I gave up spending two years for new albums.

00:22:29.000 --> 00:23:00.000
Monthly Project Yoon Jong Shin was my last resort and the key was that I was consistent over three years.

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:15.000
I advise other musician not to make things complicated when his career starts to be blurry.

00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:25.000
There is no such thing as an ace card. Just be consistent and do it over and over and it will work out after all.

00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:30.000
You said being consistent was the key factor.

00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:40.000
But I do not think consistency will bear fruits without contents that worth watching.

00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:51.000
Musical trends obviously have changed since your debut. Do you still listen to new releases?

00:23:51.000 --> 00:24:00.000
I don﹑t tend to listen too much other songs..only to the extent to read the trend.

00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:05.000
Because over-exposing myself to other contents influences me.

00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:10.000
One of my philosophy is that there is no single trend.

00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:20.000
I think trend is something that media creates. There are creator and analyst.

00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:29.000
The later also often succeeds from time to time, but I saw more of unsuccessful cases.

00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:33.000
I equate analysis-based creator to follower.

00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:43.000
That might work in advertisement or marketing, but not in our field.

00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:53.000
People seem to have diverse preference, but they all lead to certain areas.

00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:57.000
Usually top ranked contents are referred to as trendy, although they are preferred by only a portion of group.

00:24:57.000 --> 00:25:14.000
So I do not force myself to listen to other songs.

00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:24.000
I do not analyze Top 20 song of the week or month. It only disturbs me.

00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:33.000
I think this is what makes your songs original.

00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:45.000
Especially people sympathize with your lyrics, although you described it pathetic earlier.

00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:54.000
Recently, you complied your lyrics and published a book titled as I Learned Seasons from You.

00:25:54.000 --> 00:26:04.000
As I was reading the book, some of the lyrics really hit home. I wonder how you can come up with these ideas.

00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:36.000
I try to use simple words. I highly appreciate loving feelings at every moment, which I put into words at my lyrics.

00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:44.000
But they are not anything special. You all have the same feelings.

00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:52.000
What lyricists do is to remind you of those feelings with words.

00:26:52.000 --> 00:27:08.000
So I try to keep hold of those common feelings and describe them into 2-3 lines.

00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:28.000
I take lots of short notes at every moment, not to miss any single feeling that can fade away.

00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:35.000
Sounds like you try to keep your emotions on all the time.

00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:48.000
Let me throw a harder question. What is your favorite song and why? You have too many hit songs.

00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:50.000
Surprisingly, I do not much like my hit songs.

00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:53.000
I am thankful for my hit song, but they are not my favorites.

00:27:53.000 --> 00:28:04.000
I like songs that tell my story. One of my songs is called Birdman.

00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:18.000
It is about the life of an artist and how he felt over 20-30 years by keep playing on stage and releasing new songs.

00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:28.000
I got inspiration from watching the movie Birdman where Michael Keaton acted.

00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:30.000
That is how Michael Keatons life looked like.

00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:38.000
You make surprise hits at early career and when you finally feel like you know what music is about..no one is looking for you.

00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:43.000
That is our life. I also went through the same thing.

00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:54.000
Lyrics I wrote in 20s does not sound mature, but somehow people like it.

00:28:54.000 --> 00:29:05.000
My song Birdman is about the mind of an artist facing the public and that has been my favorite so far.

00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:23.000
Just like in the movie, you feel discrepancy when your favorite does not match to what the public prefers.

00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:27.000
Sounds like Birdman will get more clicks today.

00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:37.000
You are engaged in diverse fields, yet, at the same time a father of three kids.

00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:49.000
Work Life Balance is a new social agenda and something that Googlers are very interested. I wonder how you maintain it.

00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:56.000
I do not force myself to achieve Work Life Balance. My principle is to prioritize based on my preference.

00:29:56.000 --> 00:30:10.000
For example, I always find solution on the things I wanted to do and vice versa for the things that I do not prefer.

00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:19.000
What is important is to build circumstance that enables it. We cannot always do things that we want.

00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:30.000
So I prioritize them. It could be home, company or artistic works.

00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:37.000
I guess it is both fortunate and unfortunate that artistic creation always has been my top priority.

00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:48.000
I rather spend time at studio to write songs than doing something else.

00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:56.000
That eventually leads to business and I am invited today to talk about it.

00:30:56.000 --> 00:31:08.000
Work really started to get busy in 40s and 50s so the downside is I am less engaged to my family.

00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:12.000
You feel yourself is less engaged with your family?

00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:19.000
Yes. So I do not make much objections with less speech rights.

00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:25.000
That is the way to keep your family happy. You should all keep it in mind.

00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:35.000
Quiet dad nurtures great children. You should not nag your kids when you are less engaged.

00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:42.000
You only end up being criticized. You should not dare to ask such thing as Are you really sure about it?

00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:48.000
All dads in this room. You should listen up.

00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:50.000
If you are uncertain, you had better be completely uncertain.

00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:58.000
If you are like in between, you are likely be those fathers at Sky Castle (Korean drama).

00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:07.000
There is one question that we ask to every guest. It is AI.

00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:17.000
How do you think that AI makes impacts on music or entertainment industry as whole?

00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:31.000
I do not understand the mechanism of AI, but I feel like it came out of nowhere and is right on my face.

00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:54.000
Youtube is video based. My kids started to search video instead of text based search engine to get information. It was shocking to me. 

00:32:54.000 --> 00:33:10.000
At Superstar K, there was one guitar player who played John Mayer song well.

00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:26.000
One day, I wanted to play a song with him so I wrote the code and send it to him. But he said he does not know how to read code. It was an easy one.

00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:34.000
He watched John Mayer video in Youtube and simply imitated it. It took him a week.

00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:46.000
But he was so good. That is Park Jae Jung. He plays guitar and does not know how to read code.

00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:56.000
Then I realized that it is a new generation. Our generation learn to play guitar from workbook or tutors.

00:33:56.000 --> 00:34:14.000
I guess it has pros and cons. New generation lacks understanding in musical theory, but is very intuitive.

00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:40.000
Anyway, Youtube is almost inevitable in this generation and how it recommend relevant contents is based on AI right?

00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:51.000
As a musician, I think AI is a big matter in a good way.

00:34:51.000 --> 00:35:01.000
We used to market new contents to unidentified public, to be precise, to the entire population.

00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:13.000
We used to market ourselves at TV shows that were practically watched by the entire population.

00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:20.000
That was analog era and those TV shows were powerful in fact.

00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:30.000
To be a bit pessimistic, I think our generation did not even know their preference.

00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:45.000
They were like a white paper and producers could paint it with contents they wanted.

00:35:45.000 --> 00:36:01.000
As contents provider, my idea is that we no longer need to appeal to unidentified public in AI era.

00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:03.000
Why? Somebody will find it out for you.

00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:11.000
All you need to do is to throw your contents to the pool because those who like you are all here.

00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:20.000
I believe marketing will further develop with the advance of AI.

00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:29.000
Yet, many contents creators are marketing against unidentified public.

00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:34.000
They spend a lot on market and bankrupt because they could not sustain the cost.

00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:45.000
You only need to market 100,000 people, but spend the budget to market 10 million. It is costly!

00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:53.000
Marketing stays effective only one or two days. If you data says otherwise in first two days, you are done.

00:36:53.000 --> 00:37:10.000
Every K-pop producer dream of BTS or Bruno Mars. Speaking in terms of possibility, they should not.

00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:24.000
In my case, I am technically capable of capturing certain fan groups.

00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:34.000
I sometimes make jackpot like the song Like It. But it was a result of consistently producing contents.

00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:45.000
I did not compose Like It looking for jackpot. It just happened. Like I said, I was consistent and good things happened sometimes.

00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:57.000
One lesson that AI give to composers is that we do not need to impress everyone.

00:37:57.000 --> 00:38:05.000
Find the platform that captures group of people I can influence.

00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:13.000
You set the target audience and keep producing new contents for them.

00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:20.000
Who knows? You might hit jackpot if you are lucky.

00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:31.000
If you aim to conquer the world with your contents as a creator, you should take it back.

00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:38.000
I think AI makes yourself aware of how capable and influential you are.

00:38:38.000 --> 00:39:09.000
Youtube technically delivers my contents to the audience and if you make object assessment of yourself with help of AI, I think it helps pave your way as a creator.

00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:23.000
Thankfully, I have been engaged in archive based music for about a decade. Beginning from 2017, I felt I get stronger each month.

00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:41.000
For example, media started to talk about it and the Project started to generate increasing revenue.

00:39:41.000 --> 00:40:11.000
Only we know about it. It does not go crazy viral, but subscribers are steadily increasing. I always check the view clicks and comments.

00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:22.000
There is a song with 150,000 view clicks and it became 170,000 all of sudden.

00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:37.000
I call this hidden streaming. It is a sign that things are flowing into the way I intended and that is the virtue of the Project.

00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:46.000
I think creators with long term view can benefit from AI.

00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:53.000
You marked too many keywords and sayings.

00:40:53.000 --> 00:41:04.000
I think our sales team can learn lesson today.Consistent development of contents.

00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:14.000
Mass marketing is no longer effective. It is replaced by target based marketing.

00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:17.000
This is where you can make it feasible.

00:41:17.000 --> 00:41:26.000
Exactly. I think it would be very effective. How do you want yourself be remembered?

00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:30.000
I started to get this question since several years ago.

00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:35.000
First of all, it is not up to me. It is up to those who remembers me.

00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:53.000
I cannot manipulate their memory in a way that I want them to be. It is useless.

00:41:53.000 --> 00:41:57.000
I am enjoying a good life as I expected. 

00:41:57.000 --> 00:42:05.000
Some says I am not too serious. Some days I am creative. Some says I am a good father.

00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:18.000
I do not want their comments to be manipulated. What is important to me is to follow my life with my feelings.

00:42:18.000 --> 00:42:24.000
I guess I will be one of the comments that people described earlier.

00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:35.000
As I get older, one of my life principle is not to look back my milestones.

00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:45.000
I have seen many artists writing their memoirs.

00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:52.000
They all deserve to write such memoirs, yet, I still think it is much worth to think about time that has not arrived than remembering what had already happened.

00:42:52.000 --> 00:43:04.000
Also, I do not think I would be completely honest with my past and polish my milestones.

00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:26.000
I guess I can find all my pasts in Youtube and they can find it there.

00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:30.000
You can search me at Google. It is all summarized and that is me.

00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:42.000
I mean I should think about tomorrow at the age of 84.

00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:48.000
Looking back past makes me feel pathetic.

00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:57.000
I think Google searches will eventually create another individualized contents.

00:43:57.000 --> 00:44:06.000
I think people can remember me based on how it is archived at Google. Google automatically sort things out right?

00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:15.000
I guess it is a digital based memoirs.

00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:38.000
The way you described is inclusive of both past and future and I find it brilliant.

00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:42.000
Last question.

00:44:42.000 --> 00:44:50.000
You have already been engaged in various fields. Is there any other area you want to be involved?

00:44:50.000 --> 00:45:00.000
I want to explore the world before I get too old.

00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:18.000
I spend all my life in Korea so my songs and lyrics are very local.

00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:21.000
I spent 50 years of my life in Korea.

00:45:21.000 --> 00:45:24.000
So I do not know how it feel like being an alien. I never studied abroad.

00:45:24.000 --> 00:45:31.000
The longest I was away from Korea was a month when I traveled. 

00:45:31.000 --> 00:45:42.000
So I want to experience how it feels like being a foreigner.

00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:47.000
To be precise, I have never been lonely.

00:45:47.000 --> 00:45:55.000
I had friends and family during hard times. I have never been alone.

00:45:55.000 --> 00:45:58.000
I had that complex as a creator.

00:45:58.000 --> 00:46:11.000
I have been comfortable. Of course I went through hard times, but I felt loneliness at a very comfortable place. I was not a foreigner.

00:46:11.000 --> 00:46:15.000
So living as a foreigner? Or traveling?

00:46:15.000 --> 00:46:27.000
I do not want to travel to reward myself.

00:46:27.000 --> 00:46:34.000
I want to live as an alien when I am younger and create contents with new experiences.

00:46:34.000 --> 00:46:40.000
That is my dream and I guess I need to give up certain thing to make it come true.

00:46:40.000 --> 00:46:46.000
I admire that you still maintain young mindset.

00:46:46.000 --> 00:46:53.000
My wife tells me to do saying that it does not make much differences because I spend much time outside.

00:46:58.000 --> 00:47:20.000
I wish best luck with your new dreams. Let us move on to Q&amp;A session.

00:47:30.000 --> 00:47:48.000
I am a Youtube technician. First of all, I am sincerely thank you for sharing great words today. It helps both my work and life.

00:47:48.000 --> 00:47:54.000
You have a great understanding how AI works and it can impact your work.

00:47:54.000 --> 00:48:20.000
Have you ever imagined that someday AI will train itself based on your archived songs to come up with contents that are similar to yours?

00:48:20.000 --> 00:48:36.000
The reason I ask this is that you started to prepare yourself back in 2010 to cope with these platforms. I wonder whether you are doing anything on this.

00:48:36.000 --> 00:48:49.000
I had a chat about this with some people. This might really come true for movie actors.

00:48:49.000 --> 00:48:57.000
For example, imitating faces of certain actors.. This is possible, but we deal with creating contents.

00:48:57.000 --> 00:49:05.000
It is in my brain. I think AI can imitate my previous writings.

00:49:05.000 --> 00:49:16.000
I guess I am too calculating. AI would pay me to utilize my data?

00:49:16.000 --> 00:49:23.000
If it is profitable and works with me, I am fine. 

00:49:23.000 --> 00:49:41.000
Because AI would be using my copyright for its analysis. I am okay as long as I am fairly compensated.

00:49:41.000 --> 00:49:47.000
Secondly, I think human brain will further develop once we face AI threats.

00:49:47.000 --> 00:49:52.000
I believe there are rooms of change in my previous songs.

00:49:52.000 --> 00:50:03.000
Composing mechanism has been passed down since 17th century, especially melody works.

00:50:03.000 --> 00:50:23.000
If AI composure becomes the reality, I am certain there are things I can do as a creator given the circumstances.

00:50:23.000 --> 00:50:33.000
If Google ends up composing songs, I guess making a partnership will not be a bad idea.

00:50:33.000 --> 00:50:40.000
Creators imagines what would happen in AI era.

00:50:40.000 --> 00:50:51.000
AI may or may not create new song based on historical records.

00:50:51.000 --> 00:50:58.000
It is not easy to presume that certain composer might have written certain songs.

00:50:58.000 --> 00:51:07.000
I think composing songs that are similar to mine is possible by analyzing his or her composing patterns.

00:51:07.000 --> 00:51:15.000
I think doing business with Google is a good idea. I am positive. 

00:51:15.000 --> 00:51:31.000
I think creators over 30 years of experience share the same concern in emergence of AI era.

00:51:31.000 --> 00:51:42.000
I tell my musician friends that they need to be specialized.

00:51:42.000 --> 00:51:50.000
They need to be symbolic in certain fields, although it might seem narrow.

00:51:50.000 --> 00:51:58.000
I believe musicians with no characteristics would get hurt once AI era becomes reality.

00:51:58.000 --> 00:52:19.000
Because AI would not select your contents if it is too general whereas something that is unique and symbolic will be pursued.

00:52:19.000 --> 00:52:35.000
This is foreseeable. With that, you need to specialize your strength and stay on top of it.

00:52:35.000 --> 00:52:41.000
This is crucial in artist marketing. Finding irreplaceable niche market.

00:52:41.000 --> 00:52:52.000
For example, let us say sadness or rainy day in musical category.

00:52:52.000 --> 00:53:02.000
For example, there is a song called Like Rain Like Music. My song should be on the list that people can easily recall on rainy days.

00:53:02.000 --> 00:53:09.000
You cannot artificially change it overnight but if you do it over and over, you become symbolic.

00:53:09.000 --> 00:53:18.000
This is important to musician with 20-30 years of career.

00:53:18.000 --> 00:53:27.000
Otherwise, general artists without unique characteristic can be disadvantageous.

00:53:27.000 --> 00:53:30.000
Artists from various fields get together and often talk about it.

00:53:30.000 --> 00:53:38.000
Including musicians, novelist, movie scenario writer and director.

00:53:38.000 --> 00:53:42.000
What would we do once AI becomes true reality?

00:53:42.000 --> 00:53:55.000
We imagine possible scenarios rather than practically prepare ourselves.

00:53:55.000 --> 00:54:11.000
Being a specialist is crucial regardless of time and the key is to capture what the audience wants and deliver contents to meet their needs.

00:54:11.000 --> 00:54:17.000
This is a different dynamic with AlphaGo.

00:54:17.000 --> 00:54:24.000
Why? We evolve as well. It is different from computing possible moves in Go game.

00:54:24.000 --> 00:54:29.000
I guess the infinity is what makes contents special.

00:54:29.000 --> 00:54:38.000
Certainly. AI based creation is our motivation.

00:54:38.000 --> 00:54:43.000
I guess AI also would be motivated from our new contents.

00:54:43.000 --> 00:54:50.000
I imagine someday that we will keep compete with AI in this manner.

00:54:50.000 --> 00:54:53.000
Any other question?

00:54:53.000 --> 00:55:01.000
I told you that my followers are male. Women are not interested in me.

00:55:01.000 --> 00:55:20.000
You are my favorite artists and I am very nervous as I speak. I want to ask about creator.

00:55:20.000 --> 00:55:25.000
You said your jackpots were not intended and just happened, but I think it was strategic.

00:55:25.000 --> 00:55:42.000
You hire a designer to set your theme of the year. You have an annual plan for your Project whether it is remake or duet.

00:55:42.000 --> 00:55:49.000
I heard that you compose songs to sustain a quarter at a time.

00:55:49.000 --> 00:55:57.000
In that perspective, I think infusing strategic thinking is difficult as a creator.

00:55:57.000 --> 00:56:04.000
What is your key factor of strategic approach in creation? 

00:56:04.000 --> 00:56:15.000
Musical tastes are too diverse and hundreds of contents are released every day.

00:56:15.000 --> 00:56:36.000
To be a bit extreme, you are silly if you expect or aim a jackpot. My goal was to minimize loss.

00:56:36.000 --> 00:56:46.000
I guess my case is different because I have other source of income from non-music fields.

00:56:46.000 --> 00:56:55.000
My example does not fit to other pure musicians because our starting lines are different.

00:56:55.000 --> 00:57:17.000
I built my career as a musician and fame over the past 20 years. Facing AI era without such legacy make them feel vague.

00:57:17.000 --> 00:57:27.000
To be more precise, I believe jackpot or winning strategies are all lies or fraud.

00:57:27.000 --> 00:57:36.000
If anyone present that this team can make big win by adopting strategy ABC, I am not one of them.

00:57:36.000 --> 00:57:40.000
My goal was not to lose and keep sustain.

00:57:40.000 --> 00:57:47.000
I set up annual plan because my Project is long term.

00:57:47.000 --> 00:57:56.000
For example in 2012, I decided to do music with only female singers and I did.

00:57:56.000 --> 00:58:08.000
My Project looked fresh for first two years and the audience starts to be bored. That is why I need theme based planning to keep it look refreshed.

00:58:08.000 --> 00:58:19.000
Then I would stop composing and get songs from composers that I admire.

00:58:19.000 --> 00:58:30.000
Then theme based planning starts to look cliche then I adhere to the original intent of the Project once again.

00:58:30.000 --> 00:58:40.000
The virtue of my Project is that it does not foresee too far. It runs with series of short projects.

00:58:40.000 --> 00:58:57.000
For example, my longest plan lasted a year. A downside of annual project is that it prevents to include ad hoc events in my life.

00:58:57.000 --> 00:59:05.000
For example, let us say a big event occurred in January and I cannot talk about it. Because the Project is already set for a year.

00:59:05.000 --> 00:59:12.000
That happened several times. This is all I can think about, yet, I cannot write song about it.

00:59:12.000 --> 00:59:15.000
You cannot sing love songs all of sudden.

00:59:15.000 --> 00:59:22.000
Or having female singer to sing a song before its due puts much pressure then I have to sing it.

00:59:22.000 --> 00:59:25.000
And it goes against preset theme. 

00:59:25.000 --> 00:59:38.000
After the annual plan, I became engaged on monthly basis.

00:59:38.000 --> 00:59:44.000
Songs accumulate over months and so do my feeling and they became my monthly diary.

00:59:44.000 --> 00:59:56.000
I guess that is my plan if I have to call it. It keep changes.

00:59:56.000 --> 01:00:04.000
Last question. Female fan at last.

01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:15.000
Hello. Female fan finally. I am from ads team and often meet entertainment advertisers.

01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:28.000
They have strong needs to market singers, but does not want it to be obvious.

01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:36.000
In other words, they want to achieve 1 million views without making it look like an ads.

01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:48.000
Could you please advise on approach to win their mind?

01:00:48.000 --> 01:01:00.000
This is timely question. I will be collaborating with a company for my March Project.

01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:05.000
I am quite good at it. Marketing that goes with flow.

01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:19.000
For example, I have a song called Exhausted that talks about hardships of 20s. 

01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:34.000
I composed the song to comfort 20s but 3 days after the release, one commercial made a video using my song for marketing.

01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:44.000
It was obviously commercial, but apparently did not get much negative feedbacks.

01:01:44.000 --> 01:02:05.000
I think it depends on how you make it. I worked with IKEA once.

01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:15.000
Monthly Project Yoon Jong Shin receives collaboration requests from companies three times a year.

01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:24.000
Some comments criticize that they are commercial.

01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:30.000
In that case, I just be frank. Commercial is commercial.

01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:42.000
You know a commercial is successful when you get comments that your video is hyped.

01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:52.000
I do not think users in these days are too sensitive to negatives.

01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:55.000
If they do not like it, it is because it is poorly made.

01:02:55.000 --> 01:03:01.000
If they like it, they speak highly of it. 

01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:05.000
Some even simple enjoy the contents and do not buy products. 

01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:20.000
They simply enjoy contents whether they are necessarily commercial or not. 

01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:32.000
Last October, I worked with a chair manufacturer called Sidiz. They asked me to create a chair themed song.

01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:36.000
I named the song Lean on you

01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:45.000
Some pointed out that it is Sidiz commercial, but others were touched by the contents itself.

01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:50.000
When I was first approached with the request, I stared at chair. 

01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:55.000
You do not want to say this is comfortable or etc. It sounds too cliche.

01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:59.000
Then I realized I always have leaned on my chair.

01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:07.000
I also tried the company﹑s product, but did not want to describe the product itself.

01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:19.000
I started to ponder what chair means in my life. I never thought about it.

01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:24.000
You lean on chairs after all and that is how I developed the story.

01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:29.000
It is obviously collaborated with Sidiz and I did not try to hide it.

01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:44.000
You do not need to hide as long as they are well made. Youtube commentaries are hilarious.

01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:50.000
Did you see my recent posting on facebook?

01:04:50.000 --> 01:05:15.000
I was watching Harim live performance on Youtube and one of the comments was I watched Gung Ye video earlier and Youtube recommended Harin as relevant contents.

01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:26.000
If Youtube is capable of recommending Harim as a relevant contents to Gung Ye, at least it is doing a right job from visual platform perspective.

01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:43.000
Harim video can lead to Shaolin Temple. There are not much criticizing comments in these days. I tell my friend artists to enjoy the comments.

01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:50.000
Some of them are hysterical. I think comments are very creative as well.

01:05:43.000 --> 01:06:08.000
If you are dealing with advisers, I think people might all like it as long as they are brilliant. Our viewers are not naive.

01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:10.000
You might get embarrassed by trying to hide something that is obvious.

01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:18.000
That was the word of advice.

01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:22.000
Unfortunately, it is time to wrap up.

01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:29.000
By the way, there is a very good news I would like to share.

01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:33.000
What is it?

01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:40.000
Monthly Project Yoon Jong Shin has 140,000 subscribers and is awarded Youtube silver button. 

01:06:56.000 --> 01:06:58.000
Any word?

01:06:56.000 --> 01:07:08.000
I feel like joining a professional baseball team.

01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:17.000
There are creator with millions of subscribers and 140,000 is not comparable.

01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:24.000
Yet this is very meaningful because I achieve 140,000 over 10 years.

01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:38.000
98,000 subscribers are based on my efforts and the rest credit goes to ARMY (BTS fan club)

01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:40.000
Thank you ARMY!

01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:50.000
I wish you can continue to sustain until you are eligible for Gold and Diamond button. We support you.

01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:58.000
Thank you. I will continue to have fun at Youtube with new contents.

01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:17.000
