1
00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:05.490
Hey,
what's going on it's Bill Burr and it's time for the Thursday afternoon,

2
00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:08.810
just before Friday.
Monday morning podcast.
and ahhh,

3
00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:14.430
just checking in on you.
Oh,

4
00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:19.410
I'm just shout happy Turkey day to you.

5
00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:25.110
Oh,
you know,
stuffing and potatoes and pie and beer.

6
00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:30.980
Cranberries in gravy and your cousin who's gay.

7
00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:36.930
Um,
hey,
what's going on?
How are you?
Happy thanksgiving.

8
00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:40.770
Happy not having to fucking go to work today.
Huh?

9
00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:44.790
You around the table.
Are you sitting down yet?
Well,

10
00:00:44.791 --> 00:00:47.370
if you haven't gone downstairs yet,
I got,
I got some advice for you.

11
00:00:47.371 --> 00:00:48.630
Today is going to be a day.

12
00:00:48.631 --> 00:00:51.420
I think that's going to be a lot of fucking arguments.

13
00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:55.980
A lot of fucking arguments at the table,
right?
The big fucking election.

14
00:00:55.981 --> 00:01:00.720
Some people wanted the guy with the eyebrows.
Some people wanted the fucking

15
00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:06.660
with the pants suit.
Right?
Um,

16
00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:10.170
this is what you gotta do.
See,
you're already going to have a fight,
right?

17
00:01:10.171 --> 00:01:13.770
There's already going to be your older brother.
There's going to be this person,

18
00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:17.040
there's going to be another,
per,
somebody going to say something,
right?

19
00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:17.870
And you're going to be,

20
00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:20.760
you're going to have a couple of wild fucking turkeys as you standing over
there.

21
00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:23.680
You know,
eating a fucking appetizer or two.

22
00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:25.740
It's is going to be getting on your nerves.

23
00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:30.420
Maybe somebody fucking wife who won't shut the fuck up,
right?

24
00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:35.850
Why the fuck did he marry her?
Maybe.
Maybe it's the husband,
Jesus Christ.

25
00:01:35.851 --> 00:01:38.820
What is she doing with this guy?
All he does is fucking talk about himself.

26
00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:42.540
Something's going to drive you up the fucking wall.
If it's not this,

27
00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:44.970
it's going to be that this is,
this is the phrase,

28
00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:48.150
this is a phrase that's going to save your day.
Okay?

29
00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:51.000
Save the whole fucking thing.
Cause you're not going to change anybody's opinion.

30
00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:54.600
All these fucking jerk off,
still yelling.
He hung well,
could you vote for Trump?

31
00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:57.090
Well,
what the Fuck About Hillary?
You're not changing.

32
00:01:57.091 --> 00:01:58.590
You're just gonna fucking yell at each other.

33
00:01:58.591 --> 00:02:02.520
So here's the phrase she got to use to get through this fucking day.
All right?

34
00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:05.340
Along with the alcohol or whatever drug you fucking want to use,

35
00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:06.630
just fair enough.

36
00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:10.730
<v 0>You know?
Hey,
fair enough.</v>

37
00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:14.580
<v 1>That's all I,
that's all you gotta do.
What'd you say?</v>

38
00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:18.730
<v 0>Hey,
hey guys,
guys,
guys,
fair enough.
Fair enough.
Whatever.</v>

39
00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:22.340
<v 1>You don't need to see them anymore right now,</v>

40
00:02:22.341 --> 00:02:25.070
if you're younger and you still live there,
that's kind of fucking tough.

41
00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:27.980
I don't know what to tell you,
but if you've already moved out of the house,

42
00:02:27.981 --> 00:02:29.840
why are you still arguing with these people?

43
00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:33.020
Why are you still trying to change their fucking minds?

44
00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:36.500
You're not going to change their minds.
All right?
I don't give a fuck.

45
00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:41.030
If you majored in debating,
it's just stupid fucking school in the woods.

46
00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:43.370
Whatever the fuck it is.
You did that.

47
00:02:43.371 --> 00:02:47.330
Now you're coming back and now you think you know something and you think that

48
00:02:47.331 --> 00:02:51.260
you fucking siblings want to hear it.
You know what?
They don't the same way.

49
00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:53.540
You don't want to hear the way they fucking eat when they,

50
00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:56.180
and they've had a couple,
two,
three,
right?
And all of a sudden the man,

51
00:02:56.210 --> 00:03:00.010
everything just sounds like they're eating fucking mashed potatoes.
You

52
00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:03.780
<v 3>know,
you start hammering these murderers fucking thoughts,
you know?</v>

53
00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:08.020
Just fair enough.
Hey,
fair enough.
Whenever,
whenever.

54
00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:10.900
Was that what you think is that?
Is that how you look at the world?
Hey,

55
00:03:10.901 --> 00:03:14.560
God bless Ya.
Pass the fucking peas and carrots.

56
00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:17.710
Fair enough.
Fair enough.
You know,

57
00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:22.900
and that's all you've got to do that eventually the meal's going to be over.

58
00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:26.560
All right,
and you're going to get in your fucking car.
You're going to drive away

59
00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:31.290
unless you stay in there for the weekend,
then you've got to go out to,

60
00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:34.340
I don't know what you got an you got,
oh,
right.

61
00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:39.270
You gotta get the fuck out of there.
Yeah.
Thanksgiving is a tick.

62
00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:42.450
It's such a great day.
There's no pressure to get any gifts,

63
00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:47.550
eating a bunch of great food.
All of that is tremendous.
Okay.
Unless,

64
00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:51.720
unless you go into her fucking family's house or his family's house,

65
00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:53.850
that's a weird one because you know,

66
00:03:53.851 --> 00:03:56.790
you're used to all your family's food and thanksgiving.

67
00:03:56.790 --> 00:03:59.190
You know how it's supposed to taste that you're going to go somewhere else.

68
00:03:59.191 --> 00:04:02.040
It's going to taste a little bit different.
You know,

69
00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:06.300
this is like a classic standup bit,
like here's how it usually is,

70
00:04:06.301 --> 00:04:10.230
but when you're fucking blah,
blah,
blah,
it's a whole different story.

71
00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:15.300
Right?
And you just got to suck it up and just be like,
you know,

72
00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:20.790
worst case scenario,
this absolutely fucking sucks,
you know,

73
00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:24.300
in which case,
fair enough.
You know,
you don't know how to cook.
Okay,

74
00:04:24.301 --> 00:04:27.000
you're supposed to cook today.
You know,
it's,

75
00:04:27.001 --> 00:04:31.340
it's like when it's somebody's birthday,
most people can't sing,

76
00:04:31.341 --> 00:04:34.550
but God dammit,
you got to sing the song.
So they do the best they can.

77
00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:38.660
Happy Birthday,
right?
They do what the fuck they can.

78
00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:42.270
Well,
sometimes she got to take the,
the,

79
00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:47.440
the same fucking theory of a tone deaf person singing happy birthday to you

80
00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:52.310
because they love you.
Right?
You get,
you've got to apply that to food,

81
00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:54.710
which is a motherfucker,

82
00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:58.790
which brings it to how do I make it look like I ate this shit when I really

83
00:04:58.791 --> 00:05:03.050
didn't?
Well,
oh Jesus,

84
00:05:03.051 --> 00:05:06.850
I don't know how to do this one.
What you gotta do is you gotta fucking,
uh,

85
00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:11.410
eager to engage in a lot of conversation as you just sort of fucking hitting the

86
00:05:11.411 --> 00:05:15.320
plate with your fork a little bit as if you almost like,
you know,

87
00:05:15.321 --> 00:05:17.870
that noise people make when they want someone to make a speech.

88
00:05:17.871 --> 00:05:21.710
That annoying fucking thing.
You know?
Oh my God,

89
00:05:21.711 --> 00:05:24.200
nothing fucking makes my goddamned blood boil.

90
00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:27.800
Like when I'm in the middle of a fucking conversation at some kind of starts

91
00:05:27.801 --> 00:05:31.490
hitting the glass with the fork and then for whatever social fucking reason I

92
00:05:31.491 --> 00:05:35.780
have to now shut up.
You know?
Oh my God,

93
00:05:35.781 --> 00:05:39.650
that gets me God.
But not today.
Not Today.
Everybody.
Hey,
fair enough.
Hey,

94
00:05:40.290 --> 00:05:41.123
somebody down,

95
00:05:41.170 --> 00:05:43.790
somebody down the fucking street over there with a little little fucking scone

96
00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:47.680
knocking against some glass.
You know,

97
00:05:47.890 --> 00:05:52.540
I guess we all have to stop as adults.
We have to shut the fuck up,
right?

98
00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:56.920
Like we're working for this asshole baby.
You know what?
Hey,
fair enough.

99
00:05:57.680 --> 00:06:02.340
Fair enough.
You know,
he just fucking sit there.
Oh,

100
00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:06.530
here we go.
Oh,
good.
Oh,
here's a cliched what?
I'm thankful for speech.
Oh,

101
00:06:06.531 --> 00:06:09.260
is that what you're thankful for?
You know,
I'm thankful for lady.

102
00:06:09.380 --> 00:06:12.190
Every fucking word that comes out of your mouth is one less worry.

103
00:06:12.191 --> 00:06:15.650
It was one word closer to the end of whatever the fuck it is you're saying.

104
00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:17.393
<v 0>You know,</v>

105
00:06:19.070 --> 00:06:22.160
<v 3>that's when you know you're the passive aggressive movies is when someone's in</v>

106
00:06:22.161 --> 00:06:25.340
the middle of that is you.
You fucking as some,
he just kind of pointed.

107
00:06:25.341 --> 00:06:29.330
Somebody pointed some a plate,
you know,
little fucking,

108
00:06:29.830 --> 00:06:32.810
give me that bottle right there.
Still yammering on.
You know,

109
00:06:33.830 --> 00:06:37.370
you know back in 1983 when we first saw this house,
right?

110
00:06:37.450 --> 00:06:39.290
And you just sit in their butter and you fucking roll.

111
00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:46.520
Oh,
is this mother fucker gonna go every goddamn year from 1983 hey,

112
00:06:46.521 --> 00:06:51.440
you know what?
Fair enough.
Fair enough.
Yeah.
I didn't want to wear this sweater.

113
00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:55.880
Right?
He's fucking have these potatoes.

114
00:06:55.881 --> 00:06:59.960
Instant these fucking potatoes in.
Hey,
fair enough.
Hey,
you didn't,

115
00:06:59.961 --> 00:07:04.170
you didn't have time to fucking cook real ones.
Maybe they ran out of,

116
00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:07.280
of down the grows the last fuck at time they ever ran out of potatoes.

117
00:07:08.540 --> 00:07:10.220
They never run out of potatoes in this country.

118
00:07:10.221 --> 00:07:14.570
It's why somebody fucking Irish people over here,
right?
Fucking Irishmen,

119
00:07:14.571 --> 00:07:18.050
they tapped out on their own country one fucking time and their whole history,

120
00:07:18.051 --> 00:07:21.620
they run out of potatoes and everybody fucking jumped ship.
Right?

121
00:07:21.770 --> 00:07:26.150
But not the real Irishman.
They're real Irish men and real ladies.

122
00:07:26.300 --> 00:07:27.710
They fuck it stuck around.

123
00:07:30.070 --> 00:07:34.050
I like these cowards that all move to fucking New Jersey.
Um,

124
00:07:34.110 --> 00:07:36.720
but you know what a fair enough,
you know,
they wanted some potatoes.

125
00:07:41.550 --> 00:07:46.200
This is one of these days people,
you know,
and if you're younger man,

126
00:07:46.590 --> 00:07:49.650
you got to enjoy the holidays cause cause they're never going to get,

127
00:07:49.710 --> 00:07:53.490
it doesn't get better than you know,
cause you don't know any better.

128
00:07:53.520 --> 00:07:57.420
So the food tastes the way the fucking food is supposed to taste in your world.

129
00:07:57.810 --> 00:08:01.620
Right.
Everyone who's supposed to be there as there,
you know?

130
00:08:03.890 --> 00:08:06.480
So when you get older and you start expanding your fucking world and all of a

131
00:08:06.481 --> 00:08:08.880
sudden you know Jesus Christ,

132
00:08:08.910 --> 00:08:10.890
I mean you're sitting there with somebody you might've given me up,

133
00:08:11.090 --> 00:08:12.600
me might be sitting at that fucking table being,

134
00:08:12.601 --> 00:08:14.610
I don't even know if I'm with the right person right now.

135
00:08:15.870 --> 00:08:20.430
What the fuck am I take?
You know what,
hey say what?
Be Fair enough.

136
00:08:21.480 --> 00:08:25.710
I'm with somebody that I probably was never really in love with but didn't

137
00:08:25.711 --> 00:08:29.700
realize what love was.
You know,
and now here I am

138
00:08:31.290 --> 00:08:36.290
and all I gotta do is not getting in an argument for one fucking day.

139
00:08:36.390 --> 00:08:41.390
I can do this right by Saturday I'm going to be out of this fucking relationship

140
00:08:42.120 --> 00:08:44.780
and you know what?
Oh,
I'm going to be thankful then.

141
00:08:45.920 --> 00:08:46.340
<v 0>Yeah,</v>

142
00:08:46.340 --> 00:08:47.970
<v 3>you bet your sweet fuck.</v>

143
00:08:50.300 --> 00:08:51.133
<v 0>MMM.</v>

144
00:08:53.020 --> 00:08:57.630
<v 3>Oh my God.
If it starts going into,
it starts going into politics.</v>

145
00:08:57.631 --> 00:09:01.770
You almost need like a referee during this period of us history to just

146
00:09:01.771 --> 00:09:06.480
literally step in with one of those footlocker fucking athlete's foot rev
shirts,

147
00:09:06.800 --> 00:09:08.040
blow of fucking whistle,

148
00:09:08.220 --> 00:09:12.000
and just send the two people to opposite fucking Lazy Boys.

149
00:09:13.290 --> 00:09:17.340
Let it go.
Let it Aa.
It's all she went home.
She went,
oh,

150
00:09:17.470 --> 00:09:20.400
it's all okay.
She's not coming back.

151
00:09:21.090 --> 00:09:26.070
I don't think she's got a third runner.
All right.
Sit down.

152
00:09:26.130 --> 00:09:30.120
Sit down.
Sit Down Buddy.
Nobody's building a wall today.
Okay.

153
00:09:30.121 --> 00:09:33.510
Just fucking relax.
Maybe it can be the peace maker.

154
00:09:34.530 --> 00:09:39.000
Who knows who the fuck knows.
Um,
I'm actually very excited.

155
00:09:39.001 --> 00:09:42.330
You wouldn't know it this year for Thanksgiving because I'm back in my house.

156
00:09:42.930 --> 00:09:47.310
The kitchen is done.
Oh my God.
Fucking kitchen is unbelievable.

157
00:09:48.660 --> 00:09:53.660
My lovely wife fucking freaked when she saw she wasn't looking at it.

158
00:09:54.050 --> 00:09:56.280
You know,
she says like,
I just want to say it when it's done.

159
00:09:56.490 --> 00:09:58.170
I want to see it when it's done.
I didn't,

160
00:09:58.380 --> 00:10:01.530
I was peeking at the presence the whole time Rohan in my Christmas,

161
00:10:01.800 --> 00:10:03.890
but I also had to make some,
he had to make sure that the ship was looking.

162
00:10:04.020 --> 00:10:06.510
All right.
All right.
So,
uh,

163
00:10:06.810 --> 00:10:11.790
she got to see it from basically a gutted kitchen to just Bam right there,

164
00:10:11.791 --> 00:10:15.500
Fred or fucking brand new kitchen.
And uh,
it's absolutely gorgeous.

165
00:10:15.570 --> 00:10:18.480
The people who built it.
You know what?
That's what I'm thankful for.

166
00:10:18.690 --> 00:10:21.390
The people who fucking built it,
man.
It's like a,

167
00:10:21.870 --> 00:10:26.070
I can't believe that that thing is in my house and I get to go in there and make

168
00:10:26.071 --> 00:10:30.660
myself a little Lego way g this morning with some bacon and all that.

169
00:10:30.661 --> 00:10:32.880
By the way,
I bought that fucking grill top.

170
00:10:33.690 --> 00:10:37.140
I bought that little fucking griddle thing last night and uh,

171
00:10:38.050 --> 00:10:42.200
Nias pissed at me,
sort of.
You wait,
I'm going to make a one grand slam breakfast.

172
00:10:42.360 --> 00:10:46.190
Right?
And once you shut the fuck up,
a little bit of fucking Hash Browns,

173
00:10:46.280 --> 00:10:47.400
fucking Bacon,
right?

174
00:10:47.920 --> 00:10:50.610
Slide the bacon over and you cook the fucking eggs in the crease of the Bacon.

175
00:10:50.850 --> 00:10:54.030
Nick.
Nobody can handle that.
I don't know why the fuck we have gone in town.

176
00:10:54.150 --> 00:10:56.640
Him Obey all those fucking people down there.
If you want him to talk,

177
00:10:56.730 --> 00:11:00.090

178
00:11:00.091 --> 00:11:03.450
the bank and just be like,
hey buddy,
not for nothing.

179
00:11:03.451 --> 00:11:07.200
I don't know what people told you,

00:11:08.070 --> 00:11:11.880
Okay,

She's got to answer a couple of questions here.

181
00:11:16.680 --> 00:11:18.960
I don't know what the fuck I'm talking about.
It's early out here.

182
00:11:18.990 --> 00:11:22.020
Give me a fucking break.
All right.
What do you want from me?
Okay.

183

Um,

if you don't get in,

192
00:11:56.470 --> 00:12:00.520

193
00:12:00.521 --> 00:12:02.870
starts screaming and yelling,

And you can be in the back like,

196
00:12:09.050 --> 00:12:10.170

197
00:12:13.360 --> 00:12:16.870
<v 3>just walk right in the middle of it.
Oh Man,</v>

198
00:12:16.871 --> 00:12:21.430
I want to see a compilation of youtube videos of the political fucking,

199
00:12:23.500 --> 00:12:25.930
I almost said discourse.
That's probably the wrong fucking word.

200
00:12:27.310 --> 00:12:29.770
Do you really tell me fucking words?
I know that.

201
00:12:29.771 --> 00:12:32.380
I don't even know what the fuck they mean.
I just know what words they go with.

202
00:12:33.910 --> 00:12:38.140
You know,
discourse goes with political,
political discourse.

203
00:12:39.930 --> 00:12:44.170
You know,
you used the word or Nate when you're in a theater.

204
00:12:46.210 --> 00:12:51.070
I don't know what it means.
I,
I,
you know,
I remember,
you know,
I got a computer.

205
00:12:51.071 --> 00:12:53.860
I can look at any,
fair enough.
I can look it up.

206
00:12:53.990 --> 00:12:56.530
Why am I going to bore you guys with this shit?
Um,
so when he was,

207
00:12:56.531 --> 00:12:59.200
I'm back at my house and,
uh,

208
00:12:59.201 --> 00:13:01.660
one of the great things about being back at my house is when I get back to my

209
00:13:01.661 --> 00:13:06.250
house.
Okay.
I get back to all my sports packages.

210
00:13:07.240 --> 00:13:10.900
Okay.
I got the fucking center ice package.
Not Bragging.
I'm thankful for it.

211
00:13:11.200 --> 00:13:15.460
You know,
I have it.
You don't hate.
Fair enough.
Come on over.
All right.

212
00:13:15.850 --> 00:13:18.130
I get the fucking NBA one.
I don't even know what it's called.

213
00:13:18.550 --> 00:13:20.950
I just watched the Celtics.
To me it's a Celtics network.

214
00:13:21.360 --> 00:13:22.780
I'll watch the first half yesterday.

215
00:13:22.781 --> 00:13:26.770
We do all right against the fucking Brooklyn Nets.
You know,

216
00:13:27.580 --> 00:13:29.080
I think it's cool.
They moved to Brooklyn,

217
00:13:29.410 --> 00:13:31.720
that place when they were in New Jersey.
I was just sad.

218
00:13:31.780 --> 00:13:35.620
I was just a sad fucking place,
you know,
maybe not for the devils,

219
00:13:35.621 --> 00:13:39.010
but for the nets.
It was fucking sad.
You know?
Admit it.

220
00:13:39.070 --> 00:13:42.910
New Jersey people you never had love for him.
You know,

221
00:13:43.340 --> 00:13:46.690
then that's where like that foreign exchange student who never fucking went
home,

222
00:13:47.380 --> 00:13:50.440
you know,
or whatever.
You adopted a kid cause you thought it was a good idea.

223
00:13:50.441 --> 00:13:55.300
You know,
you sell,
what are these fucking style?
It's out here doing it.
Yeah.
I go,

224
00:13:55.301 --> 00:13:59.790
I will do it.
Fuck it.
We'll take them on.
What did they have a duty?

225
00:14:00.260 --> 00:14:02.410
You know,
you had some good years old,
Jason Kidd.

226
00:14:02.411 --> 00:14:05.350
I'm sorry if I'm fucking knock in this halls around my mouth.

227
00:14:05.351 --> 00:14:09.700
I've had this fucking cough for God damn.
I don't know,
like two fucking weeks,

228
00:14:10.540 --> 00:14:13.420
you know,
cause my,
my,
my wife with the condition she's in,

229
00:14:14.050 --> 00:14:15.670
she's fucking always hot,

230
00:14:15.671 --> 00:14:19.180
so she's got the Goddamn ac going and it just dries out my throat.

231
00:14:19.181 --> 00:14:22.610
I've never been someone I fucking hate air conditioning Ellis.

232
00:14:22.611 --> 00:14:25.900
It's like 9,000 fucking degrees out.
Then I like it.
Other than that,

233
00:14:25.901 --> 00:14:28.570
I don't like sleeping,
you know,

234
00:14:29.980 --> 00:14:34.330
feeling like I'm camping in my goddamn house.
You know?
I like it.
Like,
you know,

235
00:14:34.331 --> 00:14:38.410
nice fucking,
you know,
70 71 degrees.

236
00:14:39.100 --> 00:14:42.460
I need a seven.
That first number's gotta be a seven.
Like the price is right.

237
00:14:42.520 --> 00:14:46.090
You know,
let's see that Saturday,
right?

238
00:14:46.780 --> 00:14:51.430
You start getting into the sixes.
I wake up the next day,
I'm stuffy.
I got a mind,

239
00:14:51.431 --> 00:14:56.120
my throat's killing me.
I Dunno,
I'll tell you,

240
00:14:56.121 --> 00:15:01.070
people speaking at killing me,
I've been a,
I'm starting to begin,
uh,

241
00:15:01.100 --> 00:15:06.100
the building of my new hour and obviously having a kid's going to be a whole new

242
00:15:07.821 --> 00:15:10.400
angle for me,
but the kid's not here yet,
so,
uh,

243
00:15:10.401 --> 00:15:13.970
I just been up on stage just fucking throwing shit against the wall.

244
00:15:14.620 --> 00:15:16.820
And last night I went up to like 12 minutes,

245
00:15:17.570 --> 00:15:22.310
nothing from my other act and I just,
Jesus Christ,

246
00:15:22.311 --> 00:15:25.640
you want to talk about just feeling like you have nothing just being punched out

247
00:15:26.450 --> 00:15:27.283
and uh,

248
00:15:28.730 --> 00:15:32.180
I actually have some leftover shit I could've probably done bought out.
I did.

249
00:15:32.181 --> 00:15:33.190
All right.
I did it right.

250
00:15:33.200 --> 00:15:37.730
Went down there with a friend of mine just fucking knocking out new shit.

251
00:15:38.480 --> 00:15:41.570
We'll see.
We'll see my specials coming out in January,

252
00:15:41.571 --> 00:15:44.540
so I'm hoping I have a very inspirational December.

253
00:15:46.430 --> 00:15:47.990
Actually that's not true because I don't really,

254
00:15:47.991 --> 00:15:52.790
I don't have any road gigs until February and uh,
oh,

255
00:15:52.791 --> 00:15:54.560
do I have some fucking road gigs?

256
00:15:55.290 --> 00:15:58.280
We're putting together one in fucking Charlotte and I know what you're thinking.

257
00:15:58.281 --> 00:16:02.150
Like,
dude,
you just fucking there.
I'm going to be doing the club there because,

258
00:16:02.330 --> 00:16:06.020
uh,
the following day I'm going to Duke Carolina.
Oh yeah,

259
00:16:06.440 --> 00:16:07.670
go fuck yourselves.

260
00:16:08.630 --> 00:16:12.890
I'm going to go see coach k at Duke.
Can't fucking wait.

261
00:16:12.920 --> 00:16:16.400
It's going to be fucking crazy.
Absolutely.
Legendary,

262
00:16:16.640 --> 00:16:20.630
legendary bucket list.
You know,
I gotta get my college.

263
00:16:20.840 --> 00:16:25.310
Who fucking games go in here.
Your eyesight.
Indiana University,

264
00:16:25.311 --> 00:16:27.980
Indiana Hoosiers.
Who by the way,

265
00:16:27.981 --> 00:16:32.960
would they fucking lose to the other day like Indiana regional technical

266
00:16:32.961 --> 00:16:33.794
something or other?

267
00:16:33.890 --> 00:16:37.970
It's their first fucking win of any goddamn ranked team ever.

268
00:16:38.300 --> 00:16:40.820
I really should know their name.
I apologize that I don't,

269
00:16:41.180 --> 00:16:44.960
I saw my adopted college team,
Kansas.
Um,

270
00:16:45.350 --> 00:16:46.580
I don't know if they won their tournament.

271
00:16:46.581 --> 00:16:49.310
I was watching a little bit of that Wisconsin when I watched the,
uh,

272
00:16:49.311 --> 00:16:54.311
the semifinals when Wisconsin beat a Georgetown and I missed the final,

273
00:16:55.881 --> 00:16:57.170
which was Wisconsin versa,

274
00:16:57.171 --> 00:17:01.010
UNC because I went out and I was doing my homework last night and uh,

275
00:17:01.160 --> 00:17:02.300
but I'm a Jay Hawks Fan.

276
00:17:02.330 --> 00:17:06.620
I don't even know why I always wanted to go to their fucking,
the field house,

277
00:17:06.621 --> 00:17:09.260
whatever the fuck they call it.
That's a bucket list thing for me.

278
00:17:09.500 --> 00:17:12.830
I went to an Indiana Hoosier game way back in the day when Bobby Knight was

279
00:17:12.831 --> 00:17:16.670
still there,
the year Michigan State,
when the,
uh,
one,

280
00:17:16.671 --> 00:17:18.470
the title early two thousands.

281
00:17:19.460 --> 00:17:23.300
I went there and I sculpt a student ticket and I was so fucking excited than

282
00:17:23.301 --> 00:17:26.090
when I got to the gate.
The guy's looking at me.
I make that point.

283
00:17:26.091 --> 00:17:27.980
I was like fucking in my thirties and shit,
right?

284
00:17:28.040 --> 00:17:30.920
So the guy's looking at me like,
dude,
you're not a student.
And I was,

285
00:17:30.980 --> 00:17:35.140
I had nothing.
I just would come on
N***a.
Sorry,
kidding.

286
00:17:37.870 --> 00:17:40.370
I remember when that came out of my mouth.
I was like going,
Oh fuck.

287
00:17:40.371 --> 00:17:43.270
I'm not getting in.
Come on,
let's all you had.
You didn't go with them.

288
00:17:43.280 --> 00:17:48.280
A graduate student or I got that Brad Pitt disease from that fucking movie he

289
00:17:48.381 --> 00:17:52.440
did with Taraji p Henson.
Remember when he came out as an old baby?

290
00:17:54.230 --> 00:17:55.830
I would tell you this story.
When I watched that movie,

291
00:17:55.831 --> 00:17:57.420
how much I annoyed the woman in front of me.

292
00:17:58.140 --> 00:18:02.040
There's a scene in there when this dude is trying to fuck this chick.

293
00:18:02.041 --> 00:18:06.360
And the fucking old baby won't shut the fuck up.
And I forget what he said,

294
00:18:06.600 --> 00:18:09.870
but the look on his face was basically like,
lady,

295
00:18:09.871 --> 00:18:13.450
if you don't get that 80 year old baby,
the fuck out of here.
I swear to God,

296
00:18:13.470 --> 00:18:18.240
I can't remember.
I was fucking crying,
laughing,
you know,

297
00:18:18.270 --> 00:18:19.200
typical comedian.

298
00:18:19.201 --> 00:18:22.470
It was supposed to be this really heavy emotional moment that's supposed to

299
00:18:22.471 --> 00:18:27.420
bring tears and instead,
I don't know if you're a comedian,
it just,

300
00:18:27.421 --> 00:18:29.580
it just makes you laugh your ass off.
Cause when I'm,

301
00:18:29.581 --> 00:18:32.280
what am I going them let's fucking sit in their crime and it God damn mall.

302
00:18:33.420 --> 00:18:35.430
I'll cry about that.
I'll cry then I'm in a mall.

303
00:18:35.431 --> 00:18:40.431
I'm not going to fucking cry while in a mall watching a movie right now.

304
00:18:41.620 --> 00:18:45.890
Maybe I should have.
Maybe that's what the fuck's wrong with me.
But anyways,
um,

305
00:18:45.900 --> 00:18:48.080
so I'll be watching.
I'll be talking about the Bruin.
I watched,

306
00:18:48.100 --> 00:18:52.020
I didn't watch the Bruins versa.
The fuck were we playing?

307
00:18:52.560 --> 00:18:56.950
I know we've got Ottawa.
How do you watch your Goddamn game?

308
00:18:57.060 --> 00:18:58.330
He can't remember who the fuck they played.

309
00:18:58.370 --> 00:19:03.020
All I know is Ciara went down in the second period.

310
00:19:04.190 --> 00:19:05.023
<v 5>Yeah,</v>

311

he played the blues,</v>

312
00:19:07.630 --> 00:19:10.690
my adoptive West Western Conference fucking team.
That's right.

313
00:19:11.660 --> 00:19:14.560
It was one to one than it was to one us than to to them.

314
00:19:15.160 --> 00:19:17.550
Right with Ciara went out.
That's what it started fucking going down.

315
00:19:17.810 --> 00:19:21.040
Health ended up being far too nice fucking home loss.
You know,
it was great.

316
00:19:21.070 --> 00:19:23.460
I fucking put it on the center ice package.
They were like Barilla.

317
00:19:23.630 --> 00:19:25.810
Is that a nice fucking winning streak?

Legacy box off the most legendary piece of fucking ass out there.

360
00:22:03.310 --> 00:22:08.230
Legacy box.
Uh,
when was the last time you watched your home movies?

361
00:22:08.530 --> 00:22:11.860
If you're like most Americans,
there's a box in your closet of videotapes,

362
00:22:12.310 --> 00:22:16.330
film reels and photos that don't get watched or take it out worse.

363
00:22:16.570 --> 00:22:19.960
They're actually deteriorating.
Well,
it's scary.
That's good.

364
00:22:19.990 --> 00:22:23.800
Now they got me scared.
Now I want to get this introducing legacy box,

365
00:22:23.830 --> 00:22:27.940
a simple and affordable way to get your recorded moments digitally preserved on

366
00:22:27.941 --> 00:22:31.270
DVD or a thumb drive.
Can I do a little aside here?

367
00:22:32.530 --> 00:22:33.880
I think I speak for everyone.

368
00:22:34.120 --> 00:22:37.840
When you have that porno you made with your girl that you don't know where it
is,

369
00:22:38.080 --> 00:22:41.500
just make sure you look at this shit before you send it to these fucking people

370
00:22:41.680 --> 00:22:45.370
are legacy box is going to take a whole nother meaning there.
All right.

371
00:22:45.560 --> 00:22:47.920
Here's how it works.
Load,
no pun intended,

372
00:22:48.100 --> 00:22:53.100
legacy box with your ultimate apes film pictures and audio recordings and send

373
00:22:53.111 --> 00:22:57.880

Uh,

oh oh load leg.

374
00:22:57.900 --> 00:22:59.230
I will send the fucking thing back.

375
00:22:59.380 --> 00:23:03.340
You'll get him back in a couple of weeks on DVD or a convenient thumbdrive ready

376
00:23:03.341 --> 00:23:06.700
to watch,
share and relive.
This is so perfect.

377
00:23:06.701 --> 00:23:08.080
If nobody knows who the fuck you are.

378
00:23:08.081 --> 00:23:10.870
I can't do this because I'd love to do this with all my old standup tapes,

379
00:23:10.871 --> 00:23:14.860
but I know that they would end up on fucking youtube and I cannot have that.

380
00:23:15.090 --> 00:23:15.340
All right.

381
00:23:15.340 --> 00:23:19.540
Legacy box takes care of everything and provides updates at every step of the

382
00:23:19.541 --> 00:23:20.374
process.

383
00:23:21.070 --> 00:23:25.900
That's why over 250,000 families have used them.
The Huffington Post,

384
00:23:26.110 --> 00:23:27.280
parents magazine,

385
00:23:27.281 --> 00:23:31.240
USA Today and the view are all talking about legacy box.

386
00:23:31.480 --> 00:23:32.620
That's because they're getting paid to.

387
00:23:32.830 --> 00:23:36.700
Even Disney has trusted legacy box to digitize their media.
Oh,

388
00:23:36.701 --> 00:23:39.880
speaking of a company that's got to make sure that if they don't send the wrong

389
00:23:39.881 --> 00:23:43.810

397
00:24:20.540 --> 00:24:23.600
All right,
this is CSO.
See,

398
00:24:24.260 --> 00:24:28.700
so leave me alone.
All right.
CSO is a place for comedy.

399
00:24:29.300 --> 00:24:33.740

I lived up to my commitment.

402
00:24:39.800 --> 00:24:44.210
It's comedy for nerds by comedy nerds.
CSOS spelled s e.

403
00:24:44.220 --> 00:24:49.220
E s o is the new ad free streaming service bringing you hilarious original

00:25:00.330 --> 00:25:04.040
And I had my fucking specials cause I didn't get a fucking dime from you.

408
00:25:04.550 --> 00:25:06.710
Every episode of SNL,
Holy Shit.

00:25:22.290 --> 00:25:26.120
parks and recreation and saved by the bell.
Uh,
Jesus Christ.

414
00:25:26.121 --> 00:25:27.200
This is an amazing place.

415
00:25:27.320 --> 00:25:31.400
Even British comedies like the original and the best as far as I'm concerned,

416
00:25:31.401 --> 00:25:36.110
office with Ricky Jervais saw that dangerous guy who does the Emmys.

417
00:25:36.650 --> 00:25:39.950
He's drinking a beer.
Oh,
what's going to happen?

418
00:25:40.970 --> 00:25:44.150
He's back.
What's he going to do this time?

419
00:25:44.330 --> 00:25:48.650
Probably what he did the first two times.
That's why you keep rehiring him.

420
00:25:49.440 --> 00:25:53.360
Re-Hiring rehiring.
All right.
The entire Monty python catalog,

421
00:25:53.361 --> 00:25:57.020
the it crowd and Steve Coogan as Alan Partridge.

422

Discover the next big,

423
00:25:58.760 --> 00:26:03.620
big names in comedy and watch the icons before they make it big like Louis C k

424
00:26:03.621 --> 00:26:08.150

Bo Burnham and so many more.
That's fucking hilarious.

426
00:26:13.851 --> 00:26:17.300
Those last three started like fucking 10 years after me and they're talking to

427
00:26:17.301 --> 00:26:19.680
them like they're these old,
grizzled vets.
How fucking old.

428
00:26:19.940 --> 00:26:24.940
My critically acclaimed originals and exclusive content like Harmon quests

created by comedian Dan Harmon.
Well,

430
00:26:28.281 --> 00:26:30.890
that's very modest of apoe and funny as hell.

431
00:26:30.891 --> 00:26:35.330
A variety show featuring convenience such as Jim Jefferies and Hannibal Buress.

432
00:26:35.660 --> 00:26:40.550

443

Um,

444
00:27:14.510 --> 00:27:16.850
so anyways,
I've been playing drums like a fucking lunatic.

445
00:27:17.630 --> 00:27:20.000
Been playing two hours a day for almost every day.

446
00:27:20.001 --> 00:27:23.870
I missed yesterday because that was the day before fucking thanksgiving.

447
00:27:23.871 --> 00:27:26.060
We had to run around and go get some shit.
Oh,
I didn't mention,
yes.

448
00:27:26.061 --> 00:27:27.890
So this year I'm not,
I'm not having,

449
00:27:28.030 --> 00:27:30.950
we're not having Thanksgiving here despite the fact,
you know,

450
00:27:30.951 --> 00:27:34.970
we have a brand new kitchen.
We are planning to fucking have people over.

451
00:27:35.330 --> 00:27:38.090
And then what happened?
It'd be all of a sudden a couple of people dropped out,

452
00:27:38.091 --> 00:27:40.550
everything went out the window,
and then we had to scramble.

453
00:27:40.580 --> 00:27:43.430
Now we've got all this fucking food.
Uh,
but whatever.

454
00:27:44.480 --> 00:27:47.110
I got the grill top coming out,
fucking cook it later.
Uh,

455
00:27:47.330 --> 00:27:50.360
we're actually calling an audible and we're going over to some friend's house,

456
00:27:50.600 --> 00:27:54.380
which is perfect,
you know,
because we're traveling the day of.

457
00:27:54.380 --> 00:27:56.870
So most people aren't going to be on the fucking road.
They're already there,

458
00:27:57.500 --> 00:27:58.333
you know,

459
00:27:59.200 --> 00:28:01.750
already getting into an argument because they didn't listen to this podcast and

460
00:28:01.810 --> 00:28:05.360
he didn't know enough to be like,
hey man,
fair enough.
Fair enough.
Hey,

461
00:28:05.540 --> 00:28:09.770
is that what you think?
God bless you for thinking that you think that,

462
00:28:09.771 --> 00:28:11.780
and I'm not going to change you from thinking that,

463
00:28:11.960 --> 00:28:13.820
but I don't need to think what you think.

464
00:28:13.880 --> 00:28:17.990
And you know what all I have to do is eat with you today.
That's it.

465
00:28:18.290 --> 00:28:22.580
Then I'm going to walk into the fucking living room,
you know?
Well,

466
00:28:22.680 --> 00:28:24.730
I'd go in there to watch the football game.
Oh fuck.

467
00:28:24.920 --> 00:28:28.140
Are you watching the Westminster dog show instead of the football?
Hey,
hey,

468
00:28:28.141 --> 00:28:29.700
fair enough.
Fair enough.

469
00:28:29.701 --> 00:28:32.850
You'd like to watch a bunch of clean poodles prints and around,
you know,

470
00:28:33.090 --> 00:28:37.640
I don't get it,
but you get it.
You've got here first,
whenever,

471
00:28:38.120 --> 00:28:41.850
whatever.
You got a vagina,
you run things.
Even though you always say you don't.

472
00:28:42.780 --> 00:28:47.190
Okay,
go ahead.
Do it.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Oh my God.
Look at that giant float.

473
00:28:47.790 --> 00:28:51.600
Oh my God.
Remember?
Bullwinkle of course.
Of course I do.

474
00:28:53.380 --> 00:28:54.200
<v 5>Yeah.</v>

475
00:28:54.200 --> 00:28:54.931
<v 3>Um,
anyways,</v>

476
00:28:54.931 --> 00:28:58.500
we're going to a friend's house and all I have to do is just bring the fucking

477
00:28:58.501 --> 00:29:01.650
liquor and I'm,
and I'm good to go.

478
00:29:02.180 --> 00:29:05.280
Nia is bringing over a tray of fucking Mac and cheese and that's it.

479
00:29:05.460 --> 00:29:07.410
And then we're going to go over there and we're going to eat and have a good

480
00:29:07.411 --> 00:29:10.380
fucking time.
I'll fair enough my way through the whole fucking party.

481
00:29:10.960 --> 00:29:15.520
I'll get my God damn car.
I drive home.
No leftovers,
no fucking munching away.

482
00:29:15.600 --> 00:29:20.460
Putting out a ton of goddamn white,
you know.
Perfect.
Fucking perfect.

483
00:29:21.330 --> 00:29:23.890
Um,
so anyways,
so I've been,
I've been,
uh,

484
00:29:25.700 --> 00:29:27.900
playing drums like a fucking lunatics,
but yesterday,
you know,

485
00:29:27.901 --> 00:29:29.580
I got all these nieces and nephews and shit.

486
00:29:29.581 --> 00:29:33.870
I got to buy him some fucking toys and uh,
you know,
so I was out there buying,

487
00:29:33.871 --> 00:29:38.400
you know,
just,
I don't know a bunch of Goddamn Shit and uh,

488
00:29:40.370 --> 00:29:44.170
I dunno God,
the fucking people that go in Friday,
you know,

489
00:29:45.760 --> 00:29:48.520
it's too late to tell you guys this,
but you know,
you know,

490
00:29:48.540 --> 00:29:50.680
if you don't have money,
you got to go out on Friday,
right?

491
00:29:51.240 --> 00:29:53.350
You got to get that 40% off that fucking thing.

492
00:29:53.351 --> 00:29:54.350
That's not even going to be there.

493
00:29:54.420 --> 00:29:56.680
And then you get in the store and everything else is regular price,
right?

494
00:29:56.780 --> 00:29:57.613
You got to get out there.

495
00:29:57.670 --> 00:30:02.370
You literally have to risk getting fucking trampled to go get the next goddamn

496
00:30:02.440 --> 00:30:06.430
game.
Boy,
a flip phone,
whatever the fuck it is your kid wants,
you know,
next year,

497
00:30:08.920 --> 00:30:12.910
why don't you like,
you know,
there's two ways you can,

498
00:30:13.150 --> 00:30:16.660
there's three ways you can deal with black Friday.
Okay.
One.
All right.

499
00:30:17.230 --> 00:30:22.180
Save up some fucking money,
you know,
by some less expensive gifts.

500
00:30:23.140 --> 00:30:27.970
Shoplift,
you know,
shoplift on a day that isn't black Friday.

501
00:30:29.290 --> 00:30:31.990
Or maybe you want to do it on black Friday because then you can fuck you got the

502
00:30:31.991 --> 00:30:34.690
cover of everybody getting stampeded.
They're not going to realize,
you know,

503
00:30:35.740 --> 00:30:40.330
you gotta Hibachi underneath you fucking,
there you go ladies.

504
00:30:40.360 --> 00:30:43.870
This is what you do.
You buy some fucking maternity wear,
okay.

505
00:30:43.871 --> 00:30:46.780
And then you put a fucking a bace underneath.
Oh my God.
You know,

506
00:30:47.740 --> 00:30:52.510
how many months are you?
Holy Shit.
Is that an Audi right with,
that's the handle.

507
00:30:53.650 --> 00:30:56.770
I'm sorry.
Anyways,
okay.
So that's one way of doing it.

508
00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:00.610
The second way is if you know you're going to go down there,
all right?

509
00:31:00.640 --> 00:31:03.940
What you gotta do?
You gotta do a lot of squats.
Okay.

510
00:31:03.970 --> 00:31:06.130
And I take a little bit of Jujitsu cause you know,

511
00:31:06.160 --> 00:31:08.950
you know the fights go into the floor.
Okay.

512
00:31:08.951 --> 00:31:12.930
And don't practice on those fucking rubber mats that they have in the Dojo goes.

513
00:31:13.320 --> 00:31:17.970
All right?
You want to get on a nice fucking the linoleum floor.
Okay.
For.

514
00:31:17.980 --> 00:31:20.740
So when you skip the hip and you try to fucking turn him over,

515
00:31:20.770 --> 00:31:25.120
like it's going to be a different surface.
Now,
if you've been practicing on a,

516
00:31:25.150 --> 00:31:27.940
on one of those AMF mats,
like all of a sudden you're on the floor,

517
00:31:28.120 --> 00:31:30.280
you know it's going to you.
You might,
you know,

518
00:31:30.430 --> 00:31:33.370
you might throw out your hip trying to slide on that thing.
All right?

519
00:31:34.360 --> 00:31:36.490
I will definitely add some weights.
There's a lot of big girls,

520
00:31:36.491 --> 00:31:41.320
a lot of big girls show up.
Big Girls show up on fucking black Friday.
All right?

521
00:31:42.010 --> 00:31:42.821
There's a lot of weight there.

522
00:31:42.821 --> 00:31:46.240
So maybe I'd take a little Taquito I'd learned how to use their fucking,

523
00:31:46.840 --> 00:31:51.670
you know,
all that,
all that physics coming at you.
Is that the right word?

524
00:31:51.671 --> 00:31:54.520
Whatever the fuck it is.
All that way.
You just got to have it pass right through.

525
00:31:54.521 --> 00:31:58.930
You like water.
That's what they always say,
right?
In Asian culture,

526
00:31:59.020 --> 00:32:03.270
you gotta be like water,
you know?
Oh,
is that what I gotta do?
I don't,
I do it.

527
00:32:03.271 --> 00:32:05.590
I can never touch my fucking toes the way you're doing it right now.

528
00:32:05.620 --> 00:32:08.620
I'm not like water.
Okay.
I'm like the cup that holds the fucking water.

529
00:32:08.680 --> 00:32:10.720
So how about that?
Right.

530
00:32:10.870 --> 00:32:15.250
I know water can drown you and I know that water can fucking,
you know,

531
00:32:15.940 --> 00:32:18.520
you know,
takes the form of whatever shape it's poured into.

532
00:32:18.521 --> 00:32:21.340
But would you like to meet a smash this fucking cup over your head?
Yeah,

533
00:32:21.341 --> 00:32:26.290
I didn't think so.
So being a cup.
Okay.
Or a fucking Sausa also.

534
00:32:27.280 --> 00:32:31.660
Okay,
I interrupted.
I'm sorry.
I,
you know what?
Hey,
hey.
Kung Fu master Jetta guy.

535
00:32:31.690 --> 00:32:36.160
Hey,
fair enough.
Fair enough.
Have become a water.
No,
the fuck I gotta do.

536
00:32:36.161 --> 00:32:38.710
What are you gonna do?
Huh?
What am I going to do?

537
00:32:39.080 --> 00:32:42.410
Call a couple of fucking orders of food here.
Say Bend over at the waist.

538
00:32:42.411 --> 00:32:45.470
Gradually stretch in my hand.
He says that,
what the fuck I'm supposed to do?
Dude,

539
00:32:45.471 --> 00:32:49.710
it's your fucking world.
Whatever you want me to do here.
Okay.

540
00:32:49.740 --> 00:32:52.620
There's that option.
And um,
I guess I said the three options.

541
00:32:52.621 --> 00:32:54.930
You know what the third options could be?
You could just say,

542
00:32:54.931 --> 00:32:58.790
I don't observe the fucking holidays.
You don't,
by the way,

543
00:32:58.791 --> 00:33:00.590
shout out to all the Jewish people today.
You know,

544
00:33:00.591 --> 00:33:03.410
they always get left out on Thanksgiving because of their religion.

545
00:33:03.411 --> 00:33:06.390
They don't celebrate it.
You know what I mean?
They just stayed home.

546
00:33:08.270 --> 00:33:12.920
I was trying to say that,
you know,
I said that to Nia yesterday.
Right.
And uh,

547
00:33:12.980 --> 00:33:15.650
I kind of mind fucked her cause they said it really quick.

548
00:33:15.890 --> 00:33:18.200
St Jewish people did not celebrate thanksgiving.
You know,

549
00:33:18.201 --> 00:33:21.500
obviously it's Christmas,
but you know,
it's the holidays,
you know,

550
00:33:21.501 --> 00:33:22.221
if you're not Jewish,

551
00:33:22.221 --> 00:33:26.030
like you have a vague understanding of everybody else's fucking religion.
Right.

552
00:33:26.930 --> 00:33:29.590
You know,
there's a day,
you know,
you know,

553
00:33:29.600 --> 00:33:31.400
there's a couple of hollow with Jewish people,
you know,

554
00:33:31.401 --> 00:33:36.350
there's a couple of day offs we get because of their religion in September.

555
00:33:36.970 --> 00:33:39.410
All right?
Or at least days we don't have to try as hard.

556
00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:43.760
And then there's a day they eat Chinese food,

557
00:33:43.790 --> 00:33:47.240
which is I believe Christmas or is it,
I think it's Christmas,
right?

558
00:33:48.680 --> 00:33:51.740
I don't know what the fuck they do on new years.
Nobody fucking knows.

559
00:33:51.920 --> 00:33:54.230
So if you're not Jewish,
she can throw shit out like that.

560
00:33:54.231 --> 00:33:59.120
So I just throw out to near go and like,
uh,
we were in the grocery store.
I said,

561
00:33:59.121 --> 00:34:02.480
you know what,
that's take time to give thanks.
You know,

562
00:34:02.780 --> 00:34:06.200
and pray for all those Jewish people that don't celebrate Thanksgiving and then

563
00:34:06.201 --> 00:34:07.190
she just goes,

564
00:34:08.360 --> 00:34:13.130
fat isn't remotely true or something like she was trying to do with math in her

565
00:34:13.131 --> 00:34:15.890
head.
I forget what the fuck she said and I died laughing.
I was like,

566
00:34:15.920 --> 00:34:18.920
you had zero confidence in that right now.
And then she thought about it.

567
00:34:18.921 --> 00:34:21.740
She goes,
no,
they sense a fuss about fucking give it thanks.

568
00:34:22.070 --> 00:34:26.300
Everybody celebrates it,
right?
Except for Isis

569
00:34:28.980 --> 00:34:33.140
and the terrorists.
Listen,
listen.
Do you guys have a thanksgiving?

570
00:34:34.400 --> 00:34:36.110
What do you guys give?
Thanks for,
Huh?

571
00:34:39.380 --> 00:34:40.940
I can't go down that fucking road.

572
00:34:41.690 --> 00:34:43.610
It's going to be too God damn politically incorrect.

573
00:34:43.960 --> 00:34:46.720
That's something late night at a comedy club you could do,

574
00:34:46.870 --> 00:34:49.030
but not this day and age.

575
00:34:49.440 --> 00:34:53.350
We're all of a sudden then somebody takes this clip and uploads it to fucking

576
00:34:53.620 --> 00:34:58.620
drug soccer mom@fourintheafternoon.org and all of a sudden I find that fucking

577
00:34:59.270 --> 00:35:04.070
in Fab.
Shut up.
Yeah.
Just drink your way to menopause lady.

578
00:35:04.130 --> 00:35:07.680
All right.
On a know Aa ladies,
ladies.
Yeah,
fair enough.

579
00:35:08.280 --> 00:35:11.910
Fair a fuck enough.
Oh,
you know,

580
00:35:11.911 --> 00:35:14.550
dash you're a dancer and plants there and fixing.

581
00:35:14.551 --> 00:35:17.880
Do you know the capital records building already had their fucking Christmas

582
00:35:17.881 --> 00:35:20.370
tree up before thanksgiving?

583
00:35:21.900 --> 00:35:23.820
I don't know what the fuck they're doing over there.
There's just,

584
00:35:23.821 --> 00:35:25.230
there's something wrong about that.

585
00:35:26.280 --> 00:35:29.340
You know what about Tommy fucking Turkey?

586
00:35:30.120 --> 00:35:32.670
It was weird this year when I was in the grocery store and we were getting our

587
00:35:32.671 --> 00:35:37.140
fucking,
all these food for this party evidently would not have enough.
Um,

588
00:35:38.610 --> 00:35:39.780
for the first time ever,

589
00:35:39.781 --> 00:35:43.380
I actually looked at a package at Turkey necks and I was like,
I'd eat that shit.

590
00:35:44.310 --> 00:35:48.830
You know what I mean?
It's decent meat.
What do you,
how do you guys,

591
00:35:48.980 --> 00:35:52.670
do you guys prepare your,
your,
your,
uh,
Turkey necks?
Use it for a stew.

592
00:35:54.650 --> 00:35:56.780
Fuck.
Alright,
here we go.

593
00:35:57.950 --> 00:36:01.190
Let's read a couple more of these that I'm going to get on the fucking treadmill

594
00:36:01.191 --> 00:36:03.620

You know,
that's another good thing you can do in the morning time,

595
00:36:03.920 --> 00:36:07.010
right?
Get on a fucking treadmill,
knock out a good half hour or whatever,

596
00:36:07.040 --> 00:36:10.670
you know,
just kill the apps that you're gonna eat today.
Um,

600

666
00:40:36.631 --> 00:40:40.560
younger and they just go,
okay,
go into your settings.
It's like,
I'll fuck you.

667
00:40:41.820 --> 00:40:42.390
Go into the

668
00:40:42.390 --> 00:40:46.260
<v 1>bowels of this device and just start scrolling and then click on this and then</v>

669
00:40:46.261 --> 00:40:48.840
another window opens up and then scroll down to this.

670
00:40:48.841 --> 00:40:52.740
And then do this and then do that.
And then in the end they're like,
okay,

671
00:40:52.741 --> 00:40:57.180
did that change anything?
Uh,
no.
No it didn't.
Oh,

672
00:40:57.190 --> 00:41:01.950
that's odd.
Okay,
let's try this.
Oh,
I'm sorry.
Are we troubleshooting right now?

673
00:41:03.450 --> 00:41:03.590
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

674
00:41:03.590 --> 00:41:08.120
<v 1>Am I talking to somebody in the Malaysian islands trying to troubleshoot my</v>

675
00:41:08.121 --> 00:41:08.954
fucking phone.

676
00:41:11.790 --> 00:41:12.140
<v 0>Okay.</v>

677
00:41:12.140 --> 00:41:14.840
<v 3>I swear to God,
half of this shit.
I just want to fucking mail it back.</v>

678
00:41:16.160 --> 00:41:16.791
I'm telling you,
man,

679
00:41:16.791 --> 00:41:21.320
we should've just quit in like 1995 1995 we had all the technology we need.

680
00:41:21.730 --> 00:41:26.690
All right.
Cars had reared spoilers.
You know,
you had a VCR.

681
00:41:27.800 --> 00:41:28.670
VCR was great.

682
00:41:29.540 --> 00:41:34.460
BCI was great when you didn't know what DVD was when there was no youtube,
right.

683
00:41:36.860 --> 00:41:41.750
People paid for porn.
It was a different time.
It really was.

684
00:41:42.470 --> 00:41:46.370
You know,
that's what these fucking millennials are going to be nostalgic about.

685
00:41:46.400 --> 00:41:50.120
Like lesser technology.
I have no idea.
I should talk,

686
00:41:51.250 --> 00:41:52.760
you know,
I don't fucking know.
You know,

687
00:41:52.790 --> 00:41:54.050
you know what I've been looking at lately.

688
00:41:55.570 --> 00:41:58.510
It's cause I got the little one coming and I want to fucking keep playing drums

689
00:41:58.511 --> 00:42:02.650
in the house.
So I was thinking about getting an electronic drum kit,
you know,

690
00:42:03.100 --> 00:42:06.220
boil boy would sure be great if somebody hooked me up with electronic drum kit

691
00:42:06.221 --> 00:42:11.170
that I could promote for free on my podcast.
Look at me working it.
Yeah.
Fucked.

692
00:42:11.300 --> 00:42:13.930
And I'm gonna buy,
I'm gonna buy it because if it sucks,

693
00:42:13.931 --> 00:42:17.260
I'm going to tell you if it sucks or on.
So I was looking at all these fucking,

694
00:42:17.620 --> 00:42:22.250
um,
electronic drum kits and for my money,
Rolan makes the best ones.

695
00:42:22.251 --> 00:42:24.170
They've always been ahead of everybody else.
So they got it.

696
00:42:24.350 --> 00:42:28.100
This fucking new one that actually comes with a 22 inch bass drum that looks

697
00:42:28.101 --> 00:42:30.680
like a real acoustic drum.
I don't know what the fuck's going on with it.

698
00:42:31.010 --> 00:42:35.750
And I'm like,
holy fucking shit.
Look at that thing.
That's the one right there.

699
00:42:36.470 --> 00:42:37.610
Put your headphones on.

700
00:42:37.940 --> 00:42:40.780
All the wife hears is the sound of the sticks hitting the pads and all that.

701
00:42:40.850 --> 00:42:45.700
That's fucking it right there.
They want fucking 12 grand for this thing.
Okay.

702
00:42:46.030 --> 00:42:50.350
12 fucking grant.
Fuck that.

703
00:42:51.070 --> 00:42:54.940
I'm going to wait like five years by that thing on Ebay for like 600 bucks.

704
00:42:56.150 --> 00:42:59.520
MMM.
But anyways,
do you think I don't like about those electronic kits though?

705
00:42:59.521 --> 00:43:02.820
Is you sound way better than you really are.

706
00:43:02.850 --> 00:43:05.370
And then your ego starts going through the roof and you're just like,

707
00:43:05.580 --> 00:43:08.970
how am I not in a band that already fucking made it?

708
00:43:08.971 --> 00:43:13.260
And we all have Grammy's and gold records on the fucking wall.
And then one day,

709
00:43:13.590 --> 00:43:14.640
much to his Chagrin,

710
00:43:14.790 --> 00:43:17.970
you then go and you sit behind a real kid and you actually have to produce the

711
00:43:17.971 --> 00:43:21.970
fucking sound
and you're like,
oh yeah,
that's right.

712
00:43:22.450 --> 00:43:23.470
I'm going to stand up.
Comedian,

713
00:43:24.160 --> 00:43:27.190
I almost forgot because I've been playing an electronic kit for so fucking long.

714
00:43:28.080 --> 00:43:32.540
Um,
however though I did see a demonstration of the one,
it's the TD cave,

715
00:43:32.570 --> 00:43:36.320
TD something rather 50 and then the,

716
00:43:36.321 --> 00:43:38.820
with the 22 inch kick.
And um,

717
00:43:39.680 --> 00:43:43.280
this is how crazy technologies as I just bitched about it and said it was,

718
00:43:43.281 --> 00:43:44.114
you know,

719
00:43:44.630 --> 00:43:48.560
it was good enough in 1995 when they didn't even have the mesh heads on the

720
00:43:48.561 --> 00:43:52.940
fucking kits.
It was like hitting a Goddamn fucking brick.
Um,

721
00:43:52.990 --> 00:43:57.320
you took all the fucking,
the whole rebound or the fucking stick,
not rebound.

722
00:43:57.321 --> 00:44:00.530
The whole fucking shock of the stick hit that you took it right in your forum.

723
00:44:01.730 --> 00:44:06.540
Um,
anyways,
this guy hits the fucking ride symbol.

724
00:44:06.570 --> 00:44:09.380
This is how incredible the technology is.

725
00:44:09.381 --> 00:44:13.130
And he just takes the tip of his finger like you would on a real symbol.

726
00:44:13.490 --> 00:44:17.630
And he just touched it and it's the vibration gradually went away just like it

727
00:44:17.631 --> 00:44:19.790
would on a real one.
I don't know how the fuck they did that.

728
00:44:19.791 --> 00:44:21.320
He did it all over this symbol too.

729
00:44:22.370 --> 00:44:25.580
Cause it used to be like a certain areas you had to hit the symbol and that

730
00:44:25.581 --> 00:44:29.480
would give you the bell sound or a cow bell sound or you could choke it,

731
00:44:29.481 --> 00:44:32.010
but only if you had it there.
Now you can just do it all over the symbol.

732
00:44:32.010 --> 00:44:36.030
It's fucking amazing.
But 12 grand with the fuck.
Who's that for?

733
00:44:37.080 --> 00:44:38.640
I'll tell you is going to buy one of those fucking things.

734
00:44:39.060 --> 00:44:43.020
One of those Saudi Arabian fucking,
uh,
oil kids that,

735
00:44:43.200 --> 00:44:48.200
that fucking load up that be 52 bomber and fly all their fucking supercars to

736
00:44:48.361 --> 00:44:51.780
Britain for two months.
That's what you gotta do.

737
00:44:52.190 --> 00:44:53.970
There's any oil kids listening to me right now.

738
00:44:54.460 --> 00:44:57.390
You got to buy that $12,000 in Kit,
right?

739
00:44:57.570 --> 00:45:01.770
And you got to have the same fucked up mirror finish that you got on your 12

740
00:45:02.520 --> 00:45:06.180
Lamborghini.
You know,
that gold fucking finish.

741
00:45:08.250 --> 00:45:11.100
That's,
that's so fucking fascinating to me.
You know what I mean?

742
00:45:11.970 --> 00:45:16.790
That level of godliness,
like,
you know,
you want like you,

743
00:45:16.920 --> 00:45:19.560
it runs the whole gamut when you go around the fucking world.

744
00:45:19.680 --> 00:45:23.790
There's some people like when you go to Paris,
it's everything's fucking muted.

745
00:45:23.791 --> 00:45:27.000
And then Bam,
the scar for the fucking hat,
the bag or the shoes,

746
00:45:27.001 --> 00:45:29.670
but everything else is the background singers,
right?

747
00:45:29.820 --> 00:45:33.600
And whatever that big fucking thing is,
that's the fucking diva to die.

748
00:45:33.601 --> 00:45:37.050
The Diana Ross of your fucking outfit,
right?

749
00:45:37.980 --> 00:45:41.880
And then you go to other areas,
you go to fucking Italy,

750
00:45:41.881 --> 00:45:44.340
some places in the Middle East,
um,

751
00:45:46.110 --> 00:45:49.320
Armenians,
right?
They're like,
fuck that.

752
00:45:49.560 --> 00:45:54.120
What if we put a group together and everybody,
you got Diana Ross,
you gotta,
Rita,

753
00:45:54.240 --> 00:45:56.550
all Davis,
they go all fucking diva.

754
00:45:56.580 --> 00:46:00.750
It's a whole other fucking style and the level of confidence.

755
00:46:00.751 --> 00:46:03.720
You have to have the pull that off.
I'll tell you right now,
you know,

756
00:46:03.721 --> 00:46:04.830
can't pull that off.

757
00:46:05.130 --> 00:46:08.790
You have to have a certain level of pigment in your skin to really pull off

758
00:46:08.791 --> 00:46:11.670
flashy shit.
If you notice that Shin,
the pastry,

759
00:46:11.880 --> 00:46:16.170
or you get to get up to my fucking ancestors,
you know what I mean?
The,
the,

760
00:46:16.171 --> 00:46:18.510
the colors,
it gets real fucking limited.

761
00:46:18.750 --> 00:46:22.500
Forget about when you're a fucking ginger.
I mean,
the amount that,

762
00:46:22.501 --> 00:46:26.430
the fact that I actually have a red wind screen on my fucking,

763
00:46:26.460 --> 00:46:30.360
like if there was a picture of me right now in my pajamas,
what's,

764
00:46:30.361 --> 00:46:31.860
what's left of my red hair?

765
00:46:32.220 --> 00:46:35.740
You guys watching me talking into a mic with a red fucking windscreen,

766
00:46:35.760 --> 00:46:39.630
most of you would never listen to this podcast again.
You know what I mean?

767
00:46:39.900 --> 00:46:42.510
But if I actually had some pigment,
you know,

768
00:46:42.511 --> 00:46:47.511
I can be sitting here with gold frame glasses with a gold tooth and a gold

769
00:46:47.671 --> 00:46:50.130
microphone.
And you'd be like,
that guy is the shit.

770
00:46:54.180 --> 00:46:58.620
So there you can,
you know what?
Hey,
fair enough.
Fair enough.
You can pull it off.

771
00:46:59.100 --> 00:47:02.460
I can't.
Alright,
that's the podcast for this week.
Hey,

772
00:47:02.461 --> 00:47:04.050
happy Thanksgiving everybody.

773
00:47:04.051 --> 00:47:08.280
And I'm thankful to each and every one of you that you listen to my dumb ass

774
00:47:08.281 --> 00:47:10.860
every fucking Monday and Thursday.
All right?

775
00:47:11.610 --> 00:47:15.360
Now don't get any into,
into any arguments.
All right?

776
00:47:15.361 --> 00:47:18.090
You don't want to be that fucking person.
All right?

777
00:47:18.390 --> 00:47:23.040
Just sit back and enjoy everybody else yelling over politics,
you know,

778
00:47:23.070 --> 00:47:26.090
and then you could just be the cut in the background.
What about Joe by

779
00:47:27.930 --> 00:47:29.310
Michael Dukakis,

780
00:47:31.800 --> 00:47:34.830
<v 1>Grover Cleveland,
whatever the fuck you want to yell out there.
All right,</v>

781
00:47:34.860 --> 00:47:37.410
that's it.
Go fuck yourselves.
Have a nice weekend.

782
00:47:37.411 --> 00:47:40.500
You can't enjoy your goddamn Turkey and egg.
Fair enough.

783
00:47:40.530 --> 00:47:43.520
Don't get in any arguments.
All right?
Or maybe a dope and,
uh,

784
00:47:43.920 --> 00:47:46.380
let me know how fair enough worked out.
How long were you able,

785
00:47:46.381 --> 00:47:47.370
how many drinks in,

786
00:47:47.970 --> 00:47:50.750
we were able to stick with it before you finally lost your shit.

787
00:47:50.870 --> 00:47:55.680
And I want to hear about the arguments.
All right.
Sentiment.
Okay.

788
00:47:55.710 --> 00:47:56.543
Fuck you.
I'll see.

789
00:48:21.540 --> 00:48:22.373
<v 6>[inaudible] [inaudible]</v>

790
00:48:53.760 --> 00:48:54.593
[inaudible] [inaudible]

791
00:48:58.490 --> 00:49:00.200
you can see what I can

792
00:49:03.140 --> 00:49:07.940
throw my faith to the
next

793
00:49:11.060 --> 00:49:11.893
[inaudible]

794
00:49:13.860 --> 00:49:18.810
<v 1>Thanksgiving Day special Billy crocket.
There's a new one.
Betty Crocker.</v>

795
00:49:19.440 --> 00:49:23.280
Billy Crocker.
I liked it.
And I like to cook.
That's a good one.

796
00:49:24.570 --> 00:49:28.290
Love your intensity when it comes to bringing something to the table on

797
00:49:28.291 --> 00:49:31.850
Thanksgiving.
Absolutely.
No Pun intended.
It's,

798
00:49:32.040 --> 00:49:33.750
it's really a no brainer.

799
00:49:34.140 --> 00:49:38.300
Get good at making something and get to a point where your automatic oh,

800
00:49:38.301 --> 00:49:41.190
he's talking about,
yeah,
like I was talking about a few weeks ago.

801
00:49:41.191 --> 00:49:42.510
When thanksgiving comes around,

802
00:49:42.880 --> 00:49:47.040
you got to have that dish that you just fucking can make and you throw down and

803
00:49:47.041 --> 00:49:49.560
you take it to another level.
All right?

804
00:49:49.710 --> 00:49:51.990
Everybody else should be doing the same thing.
And then the end,

805
00:49:51.991 --> 00:49:55.920
that's the Thanksgiving meal.
Um,
so this guy goes,
yeah,

806
00:49:55.921 --> 00:50:00.600
you should get a dish downs where your automatic,
how hard can it be?
A,

807
00:50:00.601 --> 00:50:03.570
you'll,
you'll never bet you'll never been.

808
00:50:03.571 --> 00:50:06.240
You've never been expected to step out of your skill set.

809
00:50:06.360 --> 00:50:07.500
If you're baking breads,

810
00:50:07.670 --> 00:50:11.820
no one will ever expect you to bring the cranberry sauce.
Uh,

811
00:50:11.821 --> 00:50:14.910
what should go to this year?
What's Nias specialty?

812
00:50:16.230 --> 00:50:21.170
What's my Goto this year?
How about the whole fucking meal
doing?

813
00:50:21.190 --> 00:50:24.540
I'll tell you right now,
you guys think I'm a fucking one trick pony.

814
00:50:24.810 --> 00:50:28.190
I can make you a Turkey dinner.
Was stuffing

815
00:50:28.370 --> 00:50:31.250
<v 3>mashed potatoes.
My gravy game is getting better.</v>

816
00:50:31.480 --> 00:50:35.090
I've got to work on my gravy game and I know that's crucial.
All right.

817
00:50:35.900 --> 00:50:39.500
But my fucking ah,
my mashed potatoes,

818
00:50:39.680 --> 00:50:43.490
not a fucking lump in all right enough.

819
00:50:43.940 --> 00:50:47.660
Bottom to make you slat off the chair.
Um,
as they say in New Orleans,

820
00:50:47.780 --> 00:50:51.530
that's been willing to x and I admitted my stuffing.
Go Fuck Yourself.

821
00:50:52.660 --> 00:50:53.960
All right dude,

822
00:50:53.961 --> 00:50:57.680
you don't understand the recipes that I have access to all of my recipes.

823
00:50:57.681 --> 00:51:02.300
Start with melt a stick of butter and a third,
a cup of Chris.
Go on a pan.

824
00:51:06.170 --> 00:51:11.090
Okay.
So you know it's delicious.
Um,
yeah,

825
00:51:11.091 --> 00:51:11.924
my stuffing.

826
00:51:14.440 --> 00:51:15.273
<v 0>MMM.</v>

827
00:51:15.350 --> 00:51:19.130
<v 3>I don't,
I mashed potatoes or the shit,
but knee is African American,</v>

828
00:51:19.131 --> 00:51:22.160
so she likes more sweet potatoes.
So I don't,
I don't think they,
uh,

829
00:51:22.520 --> 00:51:26.810
that side respects mashed potatoes the way they should.
Okay.

830
00:51:26.811 --> 00:51:31.190
I feel like my potato,
my,
my,
my United colors of Benetton,

831
00:51:31.191 --> 00:51:35.330
whatever the fuck it is,
respect for,
for sweet potatoes and mash potatoes,

832
00:51:35.331 --> 00:51:38.090
I think I'm a little more mature

833
00:51:39.620 --> 00:51:43.850
than the lovely Nia.
Um,
what's Nia specialty?
Uh,

834
00:51:45.070 --> 00:51:47.480
Nias great at everything.
She's one of those people that I,

835
00:51:47.500 --> 00:51:52.110
I'll be out in the kitchen like there's nothing,
what the fuck?
I'm starving.

836
00:51:52.600 --> 00:51:54.190
And she be like,
what do you,
this doesn't age.

837
00:51:54.191 --> 00:51:55.220
She comes out there and exceed goals.

838
00:51:55.350 --> 00:51:58.240
You've got a couple of things on her arms and I dunno,

839
00:51:58.420 --> 00:52:00.580
I'm eating spaghetti or I don't know what the fuck I'm eaten.

840
00:52:00.640 --> 00:52:05.020
She somehow just throws it all together or make some ridiculous Omelette.

841
00:52:07.070 --> 00:52:07.700
<v 0>MMM.</v>

842
00:52:07.700 --> 00:52:11.210
<v 3>She's actually a,
a true cook.
I'm a little more robotic.
MMM.
MMM.</v>

843
00:52:12.300 --> 00:52:15.930
I think I'm going to become a,
a great cook or a better cook.

844
00:52:15.931 --> 00:52:17.220
The way I became a better comedian,

845
00:52:17.221 --> 00:52:20.130
where at first I was a joke writer and I was trapped in my act and then I

846
00:52:20.131 --> 00:52:23.580
learned how to Improv and she's kind of just watching her.
She kind of,

847
00:52:23.640 --> 00:52:26.940
as she cooks,
she's tasting it and doing all that type of stuff where I just,

848
00:52:27.300 --> 00:52:31.590
they said to leave it in 15 minutes,
it's been 15 minutes and I take it out.

849
00:52:32.380 --> 00:52:34.880
<v 0>MMM.
Um,
pies.</v>

850
00:52:35.960 --> 00:52:38.660
<v 3>I kinda got the whole thing do from start to finish.
My,
uh,</v>

851
00:52:38.690 --> 00:52:42.580
my appetizer game is terrible.
In fact,

852
00:52:42.581 --> 00:52:43.780
I don't even know if I know how to make

853
00:52:43.980 --> 00:52:44.813
<v 0>one.</v>

854
00:52:46.210 --> 00:52:48.910
<v 3>I have no idea.
But do what?
I can make a pie from fucking scratch.
Okay.</v>

855
00:52:50.110 --> 00:52:54.310
I can look at you and tell you what all your fucking problems are as I'm making

856
00:52:54.311 --> 00:52:58.120
the pie crust and not even look down once I can just feel the texture.

857
00:52:58.920 --> 00:53:00.790
You know what I'm saying?
That's how many fucking Pi's I've made.

858
00:53:02.150 --> 00:53:02.983
<v 0>All right.</v>

859
00:53:03.580 --> 00:53:06.340
<v 3>And I'll take debt pie someday and I'll bring it to your fucking house.</v>

860
00:53:07.370 --> 00:53:10.330
All right.
And I'll take a whole hunk of it just in,
I'll just shove it,

861
00:53:10.540 --> 00:53:13.000
write down your throat in these nothing that you're going to be able to say

862
00:53:13.001 --> 00:53:15.970
other than thank you for that experience.
All right.

863
00:53:16.180 --> 00:53:19.030
As of shaking up the can of whipped cream to give you a facial

864
00:53:25.920 --> 00:53:26.753
<v 6>[inaudible]</v>

865
00:53:33.640 --> 00:53:37.970
is,
it
dies.

866
00:53:39.340 --> 00:53:44.050
<v 7>Hey,
what's up?
This is the Monday morning podcast.</v>

867
00:53:45.950 --> 00:53:49.750
A little excitement in my voice when I said that
kids

868
00:53:51.730 --> 00:53:55.900
is,
you have to say,
I am excited.
Why am I excited?

869
00:53:57.190 --> 00:53:59.290
Um,
I don't know.
I don't know why.

870
00:53:59.291 --> 00:54:02.960
Maybe because it's Thanksgiving week and it's a week to give,

871
00:54:04.270 --> 00:54:06.770
you know,
one,
two year.

872
00:54:07.030 --> 00:54:12.030
Everybody has to sit down and think about why they're so lucky.

873
00:54:12.851 --> 00:54:15.860
I just shut the fuck up and give me some goddamn Turkey.

874
00:54:16.960 --> 00:54:19.540
Keep that part of the fucking Thanksgiving where else and something's going to

875
00:54:19.541 --> 00:54:24.220
give me a speech.
Like I,
I like,
I don't appreciate what I got,
you know,

876
00:54:25.000 --> 00:54:28.360
just shut up.
Um,
yeah.
So thanksgiving,

877
00:54:28.780 --> 00:54:32.710
thanksgiving week and it has a week to give.
Thanks.
I am thankful.

878
00:54:32.711 --> 00:54:34.490
I'm just fucking around and um,

879
00:54:35.200 --> 00:54:40.200
I'm making a Turkey and a with some stuffing and I had the most insane recipe

880
00:54:40.931 --> 00:54:44.140
for stuffing that none of you will be getting during this podcast because it's a

881
00:54:44.141 --> 00:54:46.810
secret family recipe.
Okay.

882
00:54:46.811 --> 00:54:51.811
So you have to be part of my family or be bang and me and catch me at a moment

883
00:54:53.861 --> 00:54:54.694
of weakness.

884
00:54:57.080 --> 00:54:59.350
He'll be a great thing of a girl did that you're just laying on your back.

885
00:54:59.351 --> 00:55:03.070
She's riding here and then somehow she,
she's so,
she's so good and bad.

886
00:55:03.071 --> 00:55:07.130
She gets you to give away a secret family recipe.
You're like,
ah,

887
00:55:08.640 --> 00:55:09.650
yeah,
yeah.

888
00:55:12.210 --> 00:55:16.400
27 pieces of white bread.
What holds it together?

889
00:55:16.580 --> 00:55:19.310
It's the egg.
Um,
alright.

890
00:55:20.630 --> 00:55:25.280
I'm literally sitting in my fucking car and my,
my Toyota Prius in a,

891
00:55:25.281 --> 00:55:27.380
in a parking lot outside.
Um,
my,

892
00:55:27.381 --> 00:55:31.220
my little offices that I have out here in a little production offices is like

893
00:55:31.221 --> 00:55:34.010
inch my way along on my little unerring pilot,

894
00:55:34.760 --> 00:55:37.340
I'm getting ready to shoot a non airing pilot,

895
00:55:37.940 --> 00:55:41.210
which basically means you shoot it and then they look at it and they go,

896
00:55:41.240 --> 00:55:46.100
either we like it and then we want to reshoot it or they go,
yeah,

897
00:55:46.340 --> 00:55:50.570
that's why a wasn't [inaudible] cause that's sucks.
So,

898
00:55:51.560 --> 00:55:56.340
um,
yeah,
that's what I got going on in my fucking life.
This creepy go.
This

899
00:55:58.070 --> 00:56:00.770
guy just pulled up next to me and I'm really worried that he's going to fucking,

900
00:56:01.740 --> 00:56:04.740
they put up my windows here in Erie that he's going to fucking bump his door and

901
00:56:04.820 --> 00:56:07.760
then my car,
which he didn't and he's kind of,
Oh,
I wouldn't say he's really fat.

902
00:56:08.540 --> 00:56:11.960
Definitely has a foreman grill.
Yeah.
That's nice.
Fucking love handle.

903
00:56:11.961 --> 00:56:16.790
Just hit my side view mirror.
All right.
Oh,

904
00:56:16.791 --> 00:56:19.970
you know a lot of people last week broke my balls.
Um,

905
00:56:20.660 --> 00:56:22.880
and an email kind of way going in like,
you know,

906
00:56:22.881 --> 00:56:26.380
cause I thought that guy rear ended me and they'll go,
what did you go check?

907
00:56:27.220 --> 00:56:30.640
You know,
what are you the most trusting guy in la?
You don't fuck,

908
00:56:31.120 --> 00:56:35.110
I got a bunch of shit like that.
And it's,
and it's basically,

909
00:56:35.290 --> 00:56:39.700
cause I figured out what it was told you my fucking car happened today.

910
00:56:40.440 --> 00:56:44.410
It was all on electric and then the car kicks over and for some reason it gives

911
00:56:44.411 --> 00:56:47.080
you a little push.
It,
it makes the car lurch forward.

912
00:56:47.470 --> 00:56:50.740
I'm really not selling hybrids on these please fucking podcast cause I make them

913
00:56:50.741 --> 00:56:54.910
sound like they suck.
They're actually there on the damn good cars.
But anyways,

914
00:56:56.200 --> 00:56:56.230
um,

915
00:56:56.230 --> 00:57:00.730
it is quick affects given I like the fuck I'm talking about and my fingers smell

916
00:57:00.731 --> 00:57:04.980
like an orange because I just ate one.
Um,
yes,

917
00:57:04.990 --> 00:57:06.220
it's Monday morning podcast.

918
00:57:06.221 --> 00:57:10.030
I do one of these once a week every Monday to give people something to laugh

919
00:57:10.031 --> 00:57:14.470
about as they sit in their cubicles as a drive or fucking run on a treadmill.

920
00:57:14.980 --> 00:57:17.650
And if you have any questions that you want me to answer,

921
00:57:17.651 --> 00:57:21.670

922
00:57:21.671 --> 00:57:26.470
Me and uh,
yeah,
if you have any questions,
I don't care how ridiculous it is.

923
00:57:26.860 --> 00:57:29.770
I will answer the question like this.
Here's a,
here's a,
here's a,

924
00:57:29.771 --> 00:57:34.540
here's a nice question.
A question number one.
Um,
hey bill,

925
00:57:34.570 --> 00:57:37.090
I've been a huge fan of yours since you barely,

926
00:57:37.390 --> 00:57:40.810
since you were barely beaten by Ruben,
started on American idol.

927
00:57:42.490 --> 00:57:46.750
Have you ever thought about giving it another shot?
Um,
you know what,

928
00:57:46.870 --> 00:57:51.290
my time on American idol,
I don't regret any of it.
I had a,
I had a,

929
00:57:51.430 --> 00:57:53.680
I had a great time.
You know,

930
00:57:53.710 --> 00:57:58.710
some of the numbers that they had is perform like Muskrat love and tie a yellow

931
00:57:59.051 --> 00:58:03.460
ribbon that,
you know,
I wouldn't trade that for the world,
but you know,

932
00:58:03.461 --> 00:58:06.790
I've moved on and I feel so much,
you know,

933
00:58:06.940 --> 00:58:09.910
I got my sexuality's out there.
Is it,

934
00:58:10.390 --> 00:58:13.260
did I dream that it wasn't on the cover of people magazine?
It's fucker standing.

935
00:58:13.261 --> 00:58:16.330
I looked like clay Aiken is what he's basically saying.

936
00:58:16.380 --> 00:58:19.780
The sad thing is that's not the first time I've heard it.
Okay.

937
00:58:21.700 --> 00:58:22.610
Um,
you know what you did,

938
00:58:22.620 --> 00:58:25.060
you just expose yourself for actually watching that fucking show.

939
00:58:25.061 --> 00:58:28.360
What do you think about that?
Huh?
I don't need this shit.
You know,

940
00:58:28.660 --> 00:58:30.010
people supposed to ask me questions.

941
00:58:30.100 --> 00:58:32.320
You're not supposed to make me feel bad about myself.
Like,
Hey,

942
00:58:32.321 --> 00:58:34.570
you look like the gay guy who lost.

943
00:58:34.760 --> 00:58:39.570
We that could've been it looked like a gay guy won,
you know,
always do.

944
00:58:39.810 --> 00:58:44.050
So we'd be in jail.
It's sucking.
No,
I'm kidding.

945
00:58:44.860 --> 00:58:47.080
Um,
but they do that.
They definitely do that.
You know,

946
00:58:47.081 --> 00:58:51.250
I learned from some of my gay friends that a lot of them actually don't engage

947
00:58:51.251 --> 00:58:54.340
in anal.
It just like,
no,
it hurts.
I'm like,

948
00:58:54.341 --> 00:58:57.100
so what do you do when evidently they just sort of sit around blowing each
other?

949
00:58:59.350 --> 00:59:04.300
Yeah.
So
let's get to question number two.
Let me see,

950
00:59:04.301 --> 00:59:08.380
maybe this one will be a little nicer.
Bill,
in my opinion,
all negative,

951
00:59:08.381 --> 00:59:12.640
bitter people,
all women.
I'm such a moron.
I can't even read here.

952
00:59:12.970 --> 00:59:16.570
Fill in my opinion,
all negative bitter people think everybody,

953
00:59:17.860 --> 00:59:20.140
everybody are always out to fuck them.

954
00:59:20.650 --> 00:59:24.620
Maybe that's why you have such a handle on conspiracy theory.
Am I wrong?

955
00:59:25.130 --> 00:59:28.790
It's another guy kind of shitting on me,
you know,
for Thanksgiving week.
You know,

956
00:59:28.791 --> 00:59:31.460
you'd think that'd be some more thankful fucking questions.

957
00:59:33.020 --> 00:59:37.420
How do you ask a thankful question?
I just can't.

958
00:59:37.480 --> 00:59:42.200
How did you become such a great person?
So thankful question.
First of all,

959
00:59:42.201 --> 00:59:43.250
if you're going to trash me,

960
00:59:43.280 --> 00:59:46.460
can you try to actually work out the grammar so you don't look like a moron?

961
00:59:47.000 --> 00:59:47.781
In my opinion?

962
00:59:47.781 --> 00:59:52.070
All negative bitter people think everybody are always out to get to fuck them.

963
00:59:53.260 --> 00:59:54.200
All right.
In my opinion,

964
00:59:54.201 --> 00:59:58.720
people who don't use capitals or punctuation or fucking morons.
Um,

965
00:59:58.980 --> 01:00:01.580
all right,
let me reread this so it actually makes sense.
Okay.

966
01:00:01.581 --> 01:00:03.770
And this guy's opinion,
of course he has to let me know.

967
01:00:03.771 --> 01:00:07.070
This is opinion in case I thought he had a staff of writers who write his

968
01:00:07.071 --> 01:00:11.770
fucking emails.
Um,
okay.
All negative bitter people think about,

969
01:00:12.320 --> 01:00:16.220
think everybody is what does this all negative,
bitter people think?

970
01:00:16.670 --> 01:00:21.640
Everybody
it gives you for,

971
01:00:21.800 --> 01:00:25.760
you've got this thing so fucked up.
I can't even read it right here.
Oh,
negative,

972
01:00:25.761 --> 01:00:28.010
bitter people think everybody.

973
01:00:29.780 --> 01:00:33.650
Everybody's out to get them out to fuck them.
How about that?

974
01:00:33.651 --> 01:00:37.220
Does that make sense?
Maybe that's why you're such a handle on conspiracy theory.

975
01:00:37.221 --> 01:00:41.090
Am I wrong?
Uh,
yes.
Yes.
You around.
Um,

976
01:00:41.390 --> 01:00:45.980
I'm not a better person.
I'm definitely a,
I definitely negative,
but,
um,

977
01:00:46.010 --> 01:00:47.780
I don't think people are out to fuck me.

978
01:00:47.870 --> 01:00:52.610
Like I don't walk into a bakery and go,
can I get a cupcake?

979
01:00:52.611 --> 01:00:56.090
And when they forget to give me a Napkin,
I don't go.
You see,

980
01:00:56.960 --> 01:00:59.690
I knew it man.
Um,

981
01:01:00.770 --> 01:01:03.020
and I think conspiracy theory gets a bad rep.

982
01:01:03.021 --> 01:01:08.021
Conspiracy theory gets trashed constantly by people who never look into

983
01:01:08.721 --> 01:01:11.480
conspiracy theory.
You know what I mean?

984
01:01:11.481 --> 01:01:15.350
All they do is they see one guy on the news who goes visit guy living in the

985
01:01:15.351 --> 01:01:19.100
moon,
and they're like,
that's right there.
That's conspiracy theory.

986
01:01:19.970 --> 01:01:22.030
That's what they,
that's what they all think.
They're,

987
01:01:22.070 --> 01:01:26.210
they all have conspiracy theories like that,
you know,

988
01:01:27.110 --> 01:01:31.770
I don't,
I mean,
I guess,
I dunno.
I Dunno what to do for you.

989
01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:35.270
You have to look at some of the conspiracies that I'm into and then make your

990
01:01:35.750 --> 01:01:39.230
judgment from there.
If you think,
I don't know,
I can't judge myself,

991
01:01:39.231 --> 01:01:41.360
but I mean if you read about the Federal Reserve,

992
01:01:41.480 --> 01:01:44.750
if you ever sit down and do the math on your mortgage in,

993
01:01:44.751 --> 01:01:49.190
realize that the bank turns you into an indentured servants for fucking 30
years.

994
01:01:50.720 --> 01:01:54.080
You know?
Do you ever think about that shit?
Do the math in your mortgage.

995
01:01:54.980 --> 01:01:59.150
I have a three of $50,000 fucking loan.
If I take 30 years to pay it back,
I paid,

996
01:01:59.300 --> 01:02:04.300
I give them $766,000 plus the 80 grand I put down on it.

997
01:02:06.380 --> 01:02:07.310
So now what are we up to?

998
01:02:07.311 --> 01:02:12.311
$840,000 so at the end of my mortgage going to be one of those morons go.

999
01:02:12.831 --> 01:02:15.650
Yeah,
no,
they fucking place doubled in value.

1000
01:02:16.550 --> 01:02:18.860
I paid three 50 now you didn't stupid.

1001
01:02:19.290 --> 01:02:24.120
You paid eight 50 you basically made about 800 bucks in 30 years and now you're

1002
01:02:24.121 --> 01:02:27.570
68 what are you going to do?
Take up water skiing,
it's over.

1003
01:02:28.110 --> 01:02:30.360
It's fucking over.
You know,

1004
01:02:30.450 --> 01:02:33.330
and at that point they've devalued the dollar because they keep printing it with

1005
01:02:33.331 --> 01:02:37.650
no gold behind it,
which causes inflation.
Now you can't afford the property tax,

1006
01:02:37.651 --> 01:02:41.550
so you have to sell it.
You move out and they get another 35 year old to move in.

1007
01:02:41.580 --> 01:02:46.500
Ben Dover,
drop his pants and it gets fucked in the ass for 30 years.
And uh,

1008
01:02:46.501 --> 01:02:49.590
yes,
I think that that is a,
I think that that's bullshit,

1009
01:02:51.740 --> 01:02:54.690
you know?
Does that mean I'm fucking nuts?
I probably coming off his nut.

1010
01:02:54.750 --> 01:02:56.310
I don't know.
I'm just saying,

1011
01:02:56.311 --> 01:03:01.311
I think my by conspiracy theories or thought out like I feel whatever they're

1012
01:03:01.561 --> 01:03:05.190
doing to dogs,
they're going to be doing to us in 10 years.
All right.

1013
01:03:05.191 --> 01:03:06.330
And I don't know if you've looked around,

1014
01:03:06.331 --> 01:03:10.650
but dogs are basically neutered with microchips in shelters waiting to be

1015
01:03:10.651 --> 01:03:13.890
rescued.
That's what a fucking dog is.
Now when you were kids,

1016
01:03:14.370 --> 01:03:18.060
remember the freedom dodge used to have,
I mean,

1017
01:03:18.061 --> 01:03:23.061
seeing two dogs fucking in public was a part of people's childhood and now you

1018
01:03:23.281 --> 01:03:27.100
know,
they can't,
they can't even fuck anymore because they,
they,

1019
01:03:27.110 --> 01:03:30.570
they've been neutered and uh,
that's what I think they got to do with us.

1020
01:03:31.640 --> 01:03:33.660
Microchips chips can deal with the population.

1021
01:03:33.810 --> 01:03:35.430
They're going to get bigger and start fixing people.

1022
01:03:36.280 --> 01:03:37.113
<v 8>Okay.</v>

1023
01:03:37.640 --> 01:03:41.500
<v 7>And if I was on right wing radio,
I'd be like,
I'm to exactly what they need out.</v>

1024
01:03:42.270 --> 01:03:45.470
Right.
Um,
that made no sense and I apologize.
All right,
question number two,
Bill.

1025
01:03:45.730 --> 01:03:49.850
Uh,
are you worried about becoming too famous?
Well,
if 40 years of age,

1026
01:03:49.851 --> 01:03:53.990
I'm worried about not becoming famous because I've invested a lot of time into

1027
01:03:53.991 --> 01:03:58.760
this.
I actually have a cool level of notoriety.
Um,
I know what you mean.

1028
01:03:59.960 --> 01:04:03.590
I think those people who are two famous,
I think they seek it out.

1029
01:04:03.740 --> 01:04:08.210
I really don't think the Paparazzi is like the CIA and they have the ability to

1030
01:04:08.211 --> 01:04:11.150
figure out when you're going to go to Starbucks without your panties on.

1031
01:04:11.600 --> 01:04:15.380
I think there's,
there's a little fucking surf.
And turf action going on there.

1032
01:04:15.440 --> 01:04:19.700
You know,
there's a little bit of the artist playing up,
you know,

1033
01:04:20.420 --> 01:04:25.120
don't they call their publicist?
You know what I mean?
Yeah.
I couldn't fucking,

1034
01:04:27.320 --> 01:04:31.010
I mean,
I don't know.
It's just,
there's just too many famous fucking people.

1035
01:04:31.880 --> 01:04:34.310
There's too many places where you can go.
Like,

1036
01:04:34.311 --> 01:04:37.370
how do they know you're coming from getting off the airplane at the airport?

1037
01:04:37.371 --> 01:04:39.800
You ever seen that?
What happens?

1038
01:04:40.030 --> 01:04:44.930
Just the guy at the sky cap just happen to know somebody in the Paparazzi.

1039
01:04:45.580 --> 01:04:48.440
Does somebody nodding right now as if they know and as if they've done it.
Maybe.

1040
01:04:48.980 --> 01:04:51.050
Okay,
maybe that happens.
Maybe that happens a little bit,

1041
01:04:51.440 --> 01:04:52.273
but you know what I mean?

1042
01:04:52.700 --> 01:04:57.560
All I know is I look at a guy like Ben Affleck and Jennifer Lopez and five years

1043
01:04:57.561 --> 01:05:02.000
ago when they were dating each other,
j Lo,
what do they call it?
Ben Flow.

1044
01:05:03.200 --> 01:05:04.033
<v 8>Yeah.</v>

1045
01:05:04.040 --> 01:05:07.780
<v 7>Uh,
Jay [inaudible],
what the fuck did they cut?
Benefit.
Benefit,
right?</v>

1046
01:05:08.810 --> 01:05:12.430
Remember that you could not get away from it.
And they were everywhere.

1047
01:05:12.490 --> 01:05:13.540
And I was like,

1048
01:05:13.820 --> 01:05:18.520
either they have to kill themselves or I do because this can't continue to

1049
01:05:18.521 --> 01:05:19.354
happen.
Right.

1050
01:05:20.500 --> 01:05:24.040
And then they broke up with each other and then all of a sudden nobody gives a

1051
01:05:24.041 --> 01:05:24.940
shit about them anymore.

1052
01:05:26.170 --> 01:05:31.000
It's like I get when to famous people date that Paparazzi swarm all over you.

1053
01:05:31.001 --> 01:05:34.450
But both of them broke up and then married other famous people.

1054
01:05:35.310 --> 01:05:35.690
<v 8>Yeah,</v>

1055
01:05:35.690 --> 01:05:40.110
<v 7>he married a Jennifer Garner and she married a</v>

1056
01:05:41.700 --> 01:05:46.160
debt debt.
Creepy looking guy.
Who Was it?
Julio Iglesias.

1057
01:05:46.440 --> 01:05:47.273
She married.

1058
01:05:48.010 --> 01:05:48.640
<v 8>Yeah,</v>

1059
01:05:48.640 --> 01:05:52.420
<v 7>he looks like he looks like the Lion Tamer.
It's not,
not the blonde haired one.</v>

1060
01:05:52.480 --> 01:05:56.050
The uh,
who is oh the lion tamers Cisco and neighbors

1061
01:05:57.610 --> 01:05:59.620
fucker.
Their name.
Who those guys.

1062
01:05:59.621 --> 01:06:03.950
He looked like the one that got grabbed by the throat.
Yeah,

1063
01:06:03.990 --> 01:06:07.170
Chris Catan looking one.
Chris Catan.
You know,

1064
01:06:07.171 --> 01:06:11.100
if they ever do the fucking uh,
Siegfried and Roy story,

1065
01:06:11.670 --> 01:06:14.890
Chris Catan has to play Roy.
And that's also,
that's a media part.

1066
01:06:15.930 --> 01:06:16.763
Maybe the blond guy,

1067
01:06:16.770 --> 01:06:19.770
his immediate park because he gets to cry at his hospital bed,

1068
01:06:20.820 --> 01:06:24.120
like Fonz a rally when Richie Cunningham wiped out on his motorcycle.

1069
01:06:24.180 --> 01:06:29.180
Remember that cause if you need him I do is fucking leather jacket was going in

1070
01:06:30.091 --> 01:06:34.740
and out because Henry Michael was crying.
Um,
okay.

1071
01:06:34.741 --> 01:06:37.430
Let me get back to the question.
Are you worried about becoming too famous?
Yeah,

1072
01:06:37.431 --> 01:06:40.440
I,
yeah,
there's a certain level you don't want to go beyond,
you know what I mean?

1073
01:06:41.070 --> 01:06:43.860
Like those guys,
like whenever I see like celebrity houses,
they're like,

1074
01:06:43.861 --> 01:06:45.810
and he has his own tennis court,

1075
01:06:46.610 --> 01:06:51.330
his own fucking movie theater and people are like,
oh my God,
that's awesome.

1076
01:06:51.810 --> 01:06:52.643
And it's like,

1077
01:06:52.710 --> 01:06:55.560
they never really think that he has his own tennis court in his own movie

1078
01:06:55.561 --> 01:06:59.530
theater because he kind of has to because he can't go,
he can't get,

1079
01:06:59.550 --> 01:07:02.670
can't go anywhere.
So yeah,
I wouldn't want to get to that level of fan.

1080
01:07:03.360 --> 01:07:08.160
I would like Steve Buscemi fame flood time.
You saw him and ogs magazine,

1081
01:07:09.060 --> 01:07:12.570
US magazine.
I was just thinking,

1082
01:07:12.571 --> 01:07:15.390
I know all those whores always wear uggs.
US magazine.

1083
01:07:15.710 --> 01:07:18.960
It was the last time you saw him in US magazine,
you know,
wearing a pair of uggs,

1084
01:07:18.961 --> 01:07:21.570
going to get some coffee.
No one gives a shit what he's doing.

1085
01:07:22.240 --> 01:07:24.990
So I think you really control it.
I think your publicist,
you know,

1086
01:07:25.380 --> 01:07:29.760
I think as long as you're not brought up on a murder charge or uh,

1087
01:07:30.090 --> 01:07:33.510
you know,
you're not drinking and drugging and just making a spectacle yourself.

1088
01:07:35.390 --> 01:07:36.210
Yeah.
I don't,

1089
01:07:36.210 --> 01:07:41.030
they think of all the famous fucking people out there who just kind of just live

1090
01:07:41.031 --> 01:07:43.520
their life,
you know what I mean?

1091
01:07:44.540 --> 01:07:45.010
<v 8>Okay.</v>

1092
01:07:45.010 --> 01:07:49.830
<v 7>I never seen,
you know,
Anthony Hopkins nutsack as he stepped out of Alexis.</v>

1093
01:07:49.960 --> 01:07:53.650
You know what I mean?
You just,
the guy wears underwear and he's not doing drugs.

1094
01:07:53.680 --> 01:07:57.310
I mean,
that's basically it.
That's how you stay out of the papers.
Just don't do.

1095
01:07:58.450 --> 01:07:59.470
Interesting.
Thanks.

1096
01:08:00.670 --> 01:08:01.150
<v 8>Okay,</v>

1097
01:08:01.150 --> 01:08:02.100
<v 7>well I guess that would suck up,</v>

1098
01:08:02.110 --> 01:08:05.650
but you're famous so you're getting a level pussy.
That's all a trade off.

1099
01:08:05.700 --> 01:08:10.100
All right.
Um,
let's get over to overrated,
underrated.
Um,

1100
01:08:10.150 --> 01:08:11.740
for those of you who are new to my podcast,

1101
01:08:11.890 --> 01:08:14.070
because I just keep getting new listeners every week,
um,

1102
01:08:14.160 --> 01:08:17.090
we do this one part it where people send me in their list of shit that they

1103
01:08:17.091 --> 01:08:18.950
think is overhead,
overhead,

1104
01:08:18.980 --> 01:08:22.910
overrated and shit that is underrated and their reasons why.

1105
01:08:22.970 --> 01:08:27.860
And I actually am contributing this week rather than letting my listeners do all

1106
01:08:27.861 --> 01:08:32.600
the work.
Um,
I would say,
uh,
overrated,

1107
01:08:32.630 --> 01:08:34.100
the l shaped couch.

1108
01:08:35.150 --> 01:08:39.070
I'm actually right now trying to buy some furniture and uh,

1109
01:08:39.110 --> 01:08:42.290
I've had an l shaped couch before and I didn't realize they suck.

1110
01:08:42.320 --> 01:08:47.320
Basically they suck because there's no place to put the TV when you have people

1111
01:08:48.891 --> 01:08:53.090
on an l shaped couch because you got people they're like,

1112
01:08:53.091 --> 01:08:56.210
and then not perpendicular.
Perpendicular is sight lines are perpendicular.

1113
01:08:56.211 --> 01:08:57.290
So where the fuck do you put it?

1114
01:08:57.790 --> 01:09:00.560
Somebody has got to turn their neck and the next going to end up hurting.

1115
01:09:00.770 --> 01:09:05.290
And not to mention it's a very,
you know,
as people start drinking,
you know,

1116
01:09:05.660 --> 01:09:07.340
people sightlines start crossing and that's what,

1117
01:09:07.341 --> 01:09:10.730
that's how guys get in the fight.
You know,
you stare in another guy too long,

1118
01:09:10.731 --> 01:09:14.540
you think somebody looking at you and he says what the fucking Jack Daniels is

1119
01:09:14.541 --> 01:09:19.040
telling you,
you know.
And next thing you know,
you fucking crash land on the,

1120
01:09:19.160 --> 01:09:22.130
on your Ikea coffee table.
It's,
you know,
where it is.

1121
01:09:22.250 --> 01:09:25.280
The guy you ended up getting to a fight with the guy that your friend brings

1122
01:09:25.330 --> 01:09:26.770
that you don't even fucking know any,

1123
01:09:26.771 --> 01:09:28.670
any consent because he doesn't know anybody.

1124
01:09:28.850 --> 01:09:33.530
He sits as far away from everybody as possible and thinking that that's the,
uh,

1125
01:09:33.860 --> 01:09:36.680
the submissive thing to do.
But it's actually an Alpha male move.

1126
01:09:36.860 --> 01:09:41.090
Cause now he's looking across everybody's lines.
Sightlines who at face forward.

1127
01:09:41.120 --> 01:09:44.180
So discovery channel thing.
So fuck l shaped couches,

1128
01:09:44.210 --> 01:09:47.480
what you want as a couch and then you want,

1129
01:09:47.481 --> 01:09:51.770
you want another one of those other couches,
the king with the,
uh,

1130
01:09:51.771 --> 01:09:54.200
with the thing that you put your big square thing that you put your feet on.

1131
01:09:54.500 --> 01:09:57.550
That's what the fuck you want.
You don't want to,
you don't want to lazy bully.

1132
01:09:57.580 --> 01:10:01.970
The lazy boys are also overrated.
They're not comfortable.
They're not,

1133
01:10:01.971 --> 01:10:02.804
they suck.

1134
01:10:03.110 --> 01:10:06.950
And all those airplanes now that have lazy boy FirstClass each and like,
oh wow.

1135
01:10:06.951 --> 01:10:10.130
Yeah that would be great.
He could sleep the whole flight just,
you know,

1136
01:10:10.131 --> 01:10:13.730
one night go downstairs to your recliner and spent fucking eight hours in that

1137
01:10:13.731 --> 01:10:18.050
thing and let me know how comfortable in this.
Um,
alright,
underrated,

1138
01:10:19.490 --> 01:10:21.290
underrated.
You know what?
I actually,

1139
01:10:21.291 --> 01:10:24.500
when I've got some fast food for a bunch of people the other night and somebody

1140
01:10:24.501 --> 01:10:28.170
actually took the time,
you know,
on the fast flu foods,
so to,

1141
01:10:28.760 --> 01:10:32.960
they actually push down the tab to let me know which one was cola,

1142
01:10:33.200 --> 01:10:36.230
which one was diet and who,
you know,
who had other,

1143
01:10:37.100 --> 01:10:41.660
and for some reason it's such a nice thing for someone to do and nobody does it.

1144
01:10:41.661 --> 01:10:43.040
So fast.

1145
01:10:43.041 --> 01:10:48.041
Food technicians who actually take the time to push that fucking thing down is,

1146
01:10:48.700 --> 01:10:52.640
uh,
is really underrated and I think they deserve a race.
Um,
all right,

1147
01:10:53.300 --> 01:10:56.440
those are mine for fun,
for the weaker.
Right.
And here's some more people,
uh,

1148
01:10:56.510 --> 01:11:01.310
overrated friends,
the TV show,
uh,

1149
01:11:01.340 --> 01:11:03.570
is that overrated?
I've never really fun.

1150
01:11:05.870 --> 01:11:07.820
Okay.
And friends is overrated,
right?

1151
01:11:07.850 --> 01:11:11.300
I hated the show when it was on and I can't believe that it's considered good

1152
01:11:11.301 --> 01:11:14.610
enough to be syndicated nationally and aired every day.

1153
01:11:14.850 --> 01:11:18.480
I think this show mostly appeal to women as,
I don't know,

1154
01:11:18.540 --> 01:11:20.820
a single guy that was waiting on the edge of,

1155
01:11:21.160 --> 01:11:25.470
of their couches for the new episode.
Yeah.
That's one of those chicks shows,

1156
01:11:26.250 --> 01:11:28.230
there's no reason.
And um,

1157
01:11:29.610 --> 01:11:33.030
I'm sure David Schwimmer isn't really like that in real life,
but,
uh,

1158
01:11:33.900 --> 01:11:38.250
I just knew every time they would do a montage of,
uh,

1159
01:11:39.300 --> 01:11:41.790
of the friends,
you know,
live their little episodes.

1160
01:11:41.791 --> 01:11:45.330
He always had to be getting really excited and jumping up and down like a chick

1161
01:11:46.170 --> 01:11:47.880
doing like a false settle,
you know,

1162
01:11:48.090 --> 01:11:51.360
lean on when chicks like something's going to be exciting and they jump up and

1163
01:11:51.361 --> 01:11:54.150
down and clap their hands.
I'm,
or maybe at least TV chicks,

1164
01:11:54.210 --> 01:11:55.220
he would always be doing that.

1165
01:11:55.860 --> 01:11:56.693
<v 8>Ooh.</v>

1166
01:11:57.850 --> 01:12:01.210
<v 7>And it just,
it just made as a guy,
if you just wanted to fucking,</v>

1167
01:12:02.590 --> 01:12:05.200
he just want to,
you know,
you just want something bad to happen to them.

1168
01:12:05.980 --> 01:12:07.240
That's what I was always waiting for.

1169
01:12:07.241 --> 01:12:09.760
I just want to see the episode where Ross got the shit kicked out of him.

1170
01:12:10.880 --> 01:12:11.713
You know,

1171
01:12:12.580 --> 01:12:16.630
I remember one time going and watch the Brady Bunch and uh,
you know,

1172
01:12:16.720 --> 01:12:20.680
what's his face?
Bobby did something to,
to Greg,

1173
01:12:20.980 --> 01:12:25.330
and somehow Greg had orange hair and he actually looked like he was mad enough

1174
01:12:25.690 --> 01:12:27.670
that he was going to beat the shit out of Bobby.

1175
01:12:27.671 --> 01:12:32.650
And Bobby was hiding behind Florence Henderson and uh,
you know,

1176
01:12:33.340 --> 01:12:37.210
I remember being a little kid really wanting to see Bobby get the shit kicked

1177
01:12:37.211 --> 01:12:40.030
out of him.
Like I wanted that.
I really wanted to see it happen.

1178
01:12:40.720 --> 01:12:44.680
And it's probably why,
you know,
30 years later I'm watching the UFC.
I mean,

1179
01:12:44.681 --> 01:12:47.680
that's the storyline that I want.
You know,

1180
01:12:47.770 --> 01:12:51.010
I just thought about that was Greg was actually sort of bang and Florence

1181
01:12:51.010 --> 01:12:53.350
Henderson.
Right?
Then I wonder if Bobby knew

1182
01:12:54.880 --> 01:12:58.450
Mike Lucan land like this evidently lives in Utah.
I don't even know why.

1183
01:12:58.451 --> 01:13:01.210
I fucking know that.
Um,
all right.
Underrated.

1184
01:13:02.200 --> 01:13:06.160
Somebody said radio hit 10.
Some of you guys,
I don't know about these suggests.

1185
01:13:06.180 --> 01:13:08.800
Is Radiohead really underrated,
critically acclaimed.

1186
01:13:08.801 --> 01:13:10.890
Everybody like talking about Austin there.
All right.

1187
01:13:10.900 --> 01:13:12.640
This man has been around for a very long time.

1188
01:13:12.820 --> 01:13:17.260
Is yet to put out an album that would be below three stars on your four star

1189
01:13:17.261 --> 01:13:18.160
scale system.

1190
01:13:18.490 --> 01:13:21.970
Whenever I try to talk to people about them or even to get a group of people to

1191
01:13:21.971 --> 01:13:25.150
go see them play live.
Nobody is interested at all.

1192
01:13:26.410 --> 01:13:29.110
And No,
I don't talk about radio head all the time.

1193
01:13:29.111 --> 01:13:32.140
The media barely ever talks about the band and when they do,

1194
01:13:32.380 --> 01:13:35.170
they only talk about OK computer,
the band's third album.

1195
01:13:35.800 --> 01:13:39.250
This band deserves a lot more attention and praise from people as they are one

1196
01:13:39.251 --> 01:13:44.050
of the best bands ever formed.
Um,
I got it.
Okay.

1197
01:13:44.051 --> 01:13:47.800
And I know what you saying.
Well this is what you gotta look at.

1198
01:13:48.760 --> 01:13:51.280
You know,
no matter how good your band is,

1199
01:13:51.310 --> 01:13:56.310
it's never going to get the attention of some girl with no panties on or with

1200
01:13:56.741 --> 01:14:01.050
the titties hanging out.
I mean,
I dunno,

1201
01:14:01.280 --> 01:14:04.300
I'll probably speaking out of turn here because I don't have a vagina,

1202
01:14:04.870 --> 01:14:09.870
but it really just seems like women realize this and they're forever showing

1203
01:14:12.550 --> 01:14:17.040
their fucking ass and things
like,

1204
01:14:17.080 --> 01:14:20.320
even like girls who will like respectable.
It's like,
no,
I'm not doing this.

1205
01:14:20.321 --> 01:14:22.180
I'm not doing booty videos and blah,
blah blah blah.

1206
01:14:22.360 --> 01:14:26.350
And then they finally get on like a sitcom or something and the first spread

1207
01:14:26.530 --> 01:14:28.420
they do.
You know what I'm saying?

1208
01:14:28.420 --> 01:14:32.260
They got on like the little coochie cutters to fucking who has hanging out.

1209
01:14:32.261 --> 01:14:34.780
You know,
they got two fingers,

1210
01:14:34.781 --> 01:14:38.620
the index and middle finger over both nipples with their mouse half open.
Like,

1211
01:14:38.950 --> 01:14:43.540
oh does somebody want their cock sock?
They always do like that,
that photo shoot,

1212
01:14:44.740 --> 01:14:48.970
you know,
laying down completely naked and everything.

1213
01:14:48.971 --> 01:14:51.970
Somehow you don't quite see their ass crack and there's no nipple but you

1214
01:14:51.971 --> 01:14:52.421
basically,

1215
01:14:52.421 --> 01:14:57.421
you basically see their entire body except for the ass crack and some nipples.

1216
01:14:58.000 --> 01:15:02.740
Other than that you've seen every piece of flesh that's on them.
And uh,

1217
01:15:02.800 --> 01:15:06.340
you know,
they always do that and I dunno,

1218
01:15:07.180 --> 01:15:09.940
that's what I don't understand why I'm always bitching about that type of shit.

1219
01:15:10.330 --> 01:15:14.230
Talking about,
Oh,
you're treating us like sex objects.
It's like fuck you every,

1220
01:15:14.290 --> 01:15:15.610
every time your career is in trouble.

1221
01:15:15.611 --> 01:15:20.320
You put on a pair of fuck me pumps and you bend over a couch and then they go

1222
01:15:20.321 --> 01:15:22.720
the new sizzling pictures of fucking

1223
01:15:24.690 --> 01:15:26.680
who's one of these girls I saw do well,
getting back to friends,

1224
01:15:27.430 --> 01:15:30.670
Jennifer Anniston and my,
but she did that on rolling stone.
You know,

1225
01:15:31.780 --> 01:15:33.280
one of the highest selling things ever.

1226
01:15:34.210 --> 01:15:37.300
I think women should embrace being treated as sex objects.

1227
01:15:38.520 --> 01:15:41.600
You know what,
what do,
what do you want to be?
We're not.

1228
01:15:41.601 --> 01:15:44.290
What do you want to be known for being like a meteorologist?

1229
01:15:46.480 --> 01:15:49.750
Sometimes I should just stop talking because that just keep going and then it

1230
01:15:49.751 --> 01:15:53.590
just get dumber and dumber.
Um,
I think that even answer that question.
All right.

1231
01:15:54.250 --> 01:15:59.170
Uh,
we got else,
we've got a couple of other here,
couple others here.

1232
01:15:59.220 --> 01:16:03.130
This guy said last week you mentioned voting for Ron Paul because of the Federal

1233
01:16:03.130 --> 01:16:07.540
Reserve.
Um,
now that's the wrong one.

1234
01:16:08.740 --> 01:16:10.510
Okay.
Okay,
Bill,
here's a question.

1235
01:16:10.511 --> 01:16:13.990
Do you have a sketch comedy show in the works also,

1236
01:16:14.020 --> 01:16:18.460
now that Randy courts coture is out and I'm not gonna say his name.

1237
01:16:19.270 --> 01:16:23.860
What are your thoughts on Brock Lesnar versus the door?
And Mac.

1238
01:16:23.861 --> 01:16:28.240
I like I lingo.
Who Do you think of when,
um,
I have no fucking idea.

1239
01:16:30.250 --> 01:16:31.720
I gotta be honest with you.
I have no idea.

1240
01:16:31.721 --> 01:16:35.290
I just know Brock Lesnar was one of the biggest human beings I've ever seen his

1241
01:16:35.291 --> 01:16:38.400
one of his texts,
you know,
it's,

1242
01:16:38.670 --> 01:16:43.670
it's like just the Pec muscle is the thickness of my entire torso and the size,

1243
01:16:45.730 --> 01:16:49.840
like from my neck down to my waist.
So I don't know.

1244
01:16:51.160 --> 01:16:54.810
Doesn't he have like a fucking tattoo right between his pecs?

1245
01:16:55.560 --> 01:17:00.190
It's like a dagger.
It's either a dagger or one of those Ben Franklin quill pens.

1246
01:17:01.290 --> 01:17:03.760
I don't know what it is.
I have no idea.
I don't know who the fuck's gonna win it,

1247
01:17:03.761 --> 01:17:06.160
to be honest with you.
I've been doing a lot of standup in those fights.

1248
01:17:06.170 --> 01:17:10.010
Always come on Saturday nights.
I ordered the NHL package,

1249
01:17:10.850 --> 01:17:15.440
so now my cable bill is like fucking 200 bucks a month.
And uh,

1250
01:17:15.770 --> 01:17:18.680
you know what I hate?
I hate whenever you're the guy hosting the fight,
right?

1251
01:17:18.800 --> 01:17:21.800
And you're like that guy.
No,
I don't want to fight six other guys to come over.

1252
01:17:21.801 --> 01:17:25.580
Everybody tosses me fucking whatever,
10,
15 bucks.

1253
01:17:27.110 --> 01:17:30.770
And then,
you know,
the fight cost me,
you know,
10,
15,
whatever.
What happens?

1254
01:17:30.771 --> 01:17:32.390
Everybody throws,
you crumpled up 20s,

1255
01:17:32.810 --> 01:17:36.230
the end of the night you stuff it in your pocket and you go out and you spend it

1256
01:17:36.231 --> 01:17:38.930
on gumballs and fucking raisins and you know,

1257
01:17:39.140 --> 01:17:43.070
toilet paper and then the bill comes along.
It's like you never had that money.

1258
01:17:44.390 --> 01:17:44.991
I don't know why.

1259
01:17:44.991 --> 01:17:48.350
Why can't you just be thankful during the week of Thanksgiving that you got some

1260
01:17:48.610 --> 01:17:50.990
fleet toilet paper?
Wow.
That is the worst fucking shirt I've ever seen.

1261
01:17:51.830 --> 01:17:56.830
Picture a lime Green Charlie Brown shirt except as did the zigzag line is just

1262
01:17:56.871 --> 01:18:01.610
straight and for some weird reason you're wearing it with incidents,
colo style.

1263
01:18:02.120 --> 01:18:04.430
And for some reason you're wearing black slacks with it.

1264
01:18:05.150 --> 01:18:10.150
And then you ran across the parking lot and sort of a run walk on the balls of

1265
01:18:10.761 --> 01:18:12.650
your feet.
Like how Walter Peyton used to,

1266
01:18:13.700 --> 01:18:17.210
maybe he's trying to avoid major injury just like him.
Um,
anyways,

1267
01:18:17.220 --> 01:18:21.390
let me wrap up this fucking podcast cause I got some Chia to you have to go do

1268
01:18:21.520 --> 01:18:25.730
and I go back into the building and no ma'am.
Um,
all right.

1269
01:18:26.660 --> 01:18:29.540
Oh,
what are we gonna do?
Oh,
let's hype type what I got coming.
Oh,
first of all,

1270
01:18:29.541 --> 01:18:29.691
you know,

1271
01:18:29.691 --> 01:18:32.630
I forgot to do with fucking thing I've got to do at the top of this podcast I

1272
01:18:32.740 --> 01:18:32.890
want is,

1273
01:18:32.890 --> 01:18:37.890
I wanted to thank Joe Perry from Aerosmith for calling in a uninformed is the

1274
01:18:38.361 --> 01:18:40.340
radio show I do with Joe to Rosa.

1275
01:18:40.910 --> 01:18:44.510
We had a great time interviewing him and he was obviously our biggest and

1276
01:18:44.511 --> 01:18:49.490
coolest guests we've ever had.
Totally down to earth.
And uh,

1277
01:18:49.550 --> 01:18:50.870
you know,
I don't know.

1278
01:18:51.380 --> 01:18:54.340
It's pretty fucking awesome to get to interview somebody who you've been

1279
01:18:54.670 --> 01:18:56.210
listening to for the last 30 years,
you know,

1280
01:18:56.750 --> 01:19:00.560
so that's what I'm thankful for this week against him.
And,
and uh,

1281
01:19:00.561 --> 01:19:03.980
I would also be thankful if people come out to my show at Caroline's the first

1282
01:19:03.981 --> 01:19:08.930
weekend in December,
let's see,
706 fifth,

1283
01:19:09.160 --> 01:19:11.510
fourth,
December 4th through the seventh.

1284
01:19:11.870 --> 01:19:13.850
I'll be at Caroline's comedy club on Broadway.

1285
01:19:13.880 --> 01:19:18.800
The last stop on the uninformed tour with me and Joe de Rosa with special
guests,

1286
01:19:19.700 --> 01:19:23.600
Harris Stanton who will be hosting and a,
and that's it.

1287
01:19:24.090 --> 01:19:28.030
Happy Thanksgiving to everybody.
Thank you for sending in the questions.
Oh,

1288
01:19:28.060 --> 01:19:30.290
if you guys could do me a favor,
if you can go to my website,

1289
01:19:30.291 --> 01:19:31.220
if you're not on it right now,

1290
01:19:31.221 --> 01:19:34.340
just go to [inaudible] dot com if you scroll down on the right hand side,

1291
01:19:35.270 --> 01:19:38.990
you can actually see where you can sign up for my email list just because a lot

1292
01:19:38.991 --> 01:19:42.830
of times they send out bulletins about being in Seattle on my space and they

1293
01:19:42.831 --> 01:19:47.300
ended up going to people who live in Albuquerque.
If you,
if you're on my website,

1294
01:19:47.450 --> 01:19:52.250
you literally just sign up on the,
uh,
the city that's nearest you.

1295
01:19:53.150 --> 01:19:56.090
So that way you don't have to get a fucking email from me every two weeks.

1296
01:19:56.091 --> 01:19:58.370
I just don't want to be spamming people or any of that shit.

1297
01:19:58.790 --> 01:20:00.260
So if you sign up on my website,

1298
01:20:00.261 --> 01:20:03.680
you'll only get bulletins from me when I'm playing in your area.

1299
01:20:03.681 --> 01:20:07.380
Or if I'm going to be on TV,
basically if it's something that you can either see,

1300
01:20:07.381 --> 01:20:11.670
watch here or go to is the only time you'll get emails.
All right.

1301
01:20:11.910 --> 01:20:14.220
So that is it.
Thank you for listening to the podcast.

1302
01:20:14.221 --> 01:20:16.980
I apologize the last couple of weeks of feeling like these things have been a

1303
01:20:16.981 --> 01:20:21.630
little bit lame because I've been,
uh,
I've been really busy trying to do,

1304
01:20:22.020 --> 01:20:25.590
do some shit out here and,
um,
and that's it.

1305
01:20:25.591 --> 01:20:27.510
So what am I going next weekend?

1306
01:20:27.511 --> 01:20:29.580
Next week is going to be out to do a Sunday night.
Next week.

1307
01:20:29.700 --> 01:20:33.750
There will be a Sunday night podcast and,
um,
I'll,

1308
01:20:33.900 --> 01:20:35.700
I'll be better rested for it.
All right.

1309
01:20:35.701 --> 01:20:40.701
But I appreciate you guys sending them the questions and I'll just keep saying

1310
01:20:40.741 --> 01:20:43.590
the same thing over and over again for another 18 minutes by don't hang up.

1311
01:20:43.591 --> 01:20:47.970
All right.
So you guys all have a good Thanksgiving and,
uh,
you know,

1312
01:20:47.971 --> 01:20:51.180
and just try to remember what you have to be thankful for.
All right,

1313
01:20:51.240 --> 01:20:52.073
I'll talk to you again.

1314
01:21:11.460 --> 01:21:14.770
<v 6>[inaudible] holy
cow.</v>

1315
01:21:18.210 --> 01:21:19.970
You can see without care.

01:21:24.030 --> 01:21:28.360
[inaudible]

The next good thing.
