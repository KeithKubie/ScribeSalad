00:00:00.413 --> 00:00:02.886
- [Voiceover] A circle is
centered at the point C,

00:00:02.886 --> 00:00:04.374
which has the coordinates negative one,

00:00:04.374 --> 00:00:05.668
comma, negative three.

00:00:05.668 --> 00:00:08.034
And has a radius of six.

00:00:08.034 --> 00:00:09.699
Where does the point P, which has

00:00:09.699 --> 00:00:12.784
the coordinates negative six,
comma, negative six, lie?

00:00:12.784 --> 00:00:13.919
We have three options.

00:00:13.919 --> 00:00:17.833
Inside the circle, on the
circle, or outside the circle.

00:00:17.833 --> 00:00:19.529
And the key realization here is

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:21.382
just what a circle is all about.

00:00:21.382 --> 00:00:26.066
If we have the point C, which
is the center of a circle,

00:00:26.066 --> 00:00:29.725
a circle of radius six, so
let me draw that radius.

00:00:29.725 --> 00:00:31.579
So we say that is its radius.

00:00:31.579 --> 00:00:32.662
Is six units.

00:00:33.688 --> 00:00:36.931
The circle will look something like this.

00:00:36.931 --> 00:00:39.506
Remember, the circle is
a set of all points that

00:00:39.506 --> 00:00:43.263
are exactly six units
away from that center.

00:00:43.263 --> 00:00:46.149
So that's the definition of a circle,

00:00:46.149 --> 00:00:47.283
it's a set of all points that are

00:00:47.283 --> 00:00:50.230
exactly six units away from the center.

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:54.397
So if, for example, P is
less than six units away,

00:00:55.486 --> 00:00:57.388
it's going to be inside the circle.

00:00:57.388 --> 00:00:59.447
If it's exactly six units away,

00:00:59.447 --> 00:01:01.661
it's going to be on the circle,

00:01:01.661 --> 00:01:03.412
and if it's more than six units away,

00:01:03.412 --> 00:01:06.345
it's going to be outside of the circle.

00:01:06.345 --> 00:01:08.816
So the key is, is let's
find the distance between

00:01:08.816 --> 00:01:10.206
these two points.

00:01:10.206 --> 00:01:12.368
If the distance is less than six, inside,

00:01:12.368 --> 00:01:14.840
distance equals six, we're on the circle,

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:18.091
distance more than six, we
are outside of the circle.

00:01:18.091 --> 00:01:19.268
So let's do that.

00:01:19.268 --> 00:01:21.229
So if we wanted to find,
well there's different

00:01:21.229 --> 00:01:23.540
notations for the distance.

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:24.778
Well, I'll just write D, or I could

00:01:24.778 --> 00:01:27.506
write the distance between C and

00:01:27.506 --> 00:01:29.673
P is going to be equal to.

00:01:30.699 --> 00:01:32.035
And the distance formula
comes straight out of

00:01:32.035 --> 00:01:33.581
the Pythagorean Theorem.

00:01:33.581 --> 00:01:35.694
But it's going to be the square root of

00:01:35.694 --> 00:01:39.656
our change in X squared plus
our change in Y squared.

00:01:39.656 --> 00:01:41.716
So what is our change in X?

00:01:41.716 --> 00:01:43.671
So our change in X, if we view C as

00:01:43.671 --> 00:01:45.478
our starting point and P as our end point,

00:01:45.478 --> 00:01:46.815
and we could do it either way,

00:01:46.815 --> 00:01:49.439
our change in X, our change in X is

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:52.106
negative six minus negative one.

00:01:53.608 --> 00:01:57.164
So negative six minus negative one.

00:01:57.164 --> 00:01:58.602
And we're going to square it.

00:01:58.602 --> 00:02:01.794
So what we have inside
here, that is change in X.

00:02:01.794 --> 00:02:04.524
So we're taking our change in X squared,

00:02:04.524 --> 00:02:07.563
and then plus our change in Y squared.

00:02:07.563 --> 00:02:09.930
So we are going, we're going from

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:11.493
negative three to negative six.

00:02:11.493 --> 00:02:14.993
So our change in Y is negative
six minus negative three.

00:02:14.993 --> 00:02:17.669
Negative six minus negative three,

00:02:17.669 --> 00:02:19.833
and we're going to square everything.

00:02:19.833 --> 00:02:22.921
So that is our change in
Y inside the parentheses,

00:02:22.921 --> 00:02:24.568
and we're going to square it.

00:02:24.568 --> 00:02:27.147
So this is equal to, this is equal to

00:02:27.147 --> 00:02:30.897
negative six, negative
six plus positive one,

00:02:32.345 --> 00:02:33.273
is one way to think about it,

00:02:33.273 --> 00:02:36.416
so this is negative five squared.

00:02:36.416 --> 00:02:40.122
And then this is negative six plus three.

00:02:40.122 --> 00:02:43.059
So plus negative three squared.

00:02:43.059 --> 00:02:44.653
And once again, you can see,

00:02:44.653 --> 00:02:47.297
our change in X is negative five.

00:02:47.297 --> 00:02:51.209
We go five lower in X, and
we're going three lower in Y.

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:53.219
So we're changing Y, is negative three.

00:02:53.219 --> 00:02:56.719
So this is equal to the square root of 25,

00:02:58.053 --> 00:03:00.423
square root of 25 plus nine.

00:03:00.423 --> 00:03:03.892
Square root of 25 plus
nine, which is equal to

00:03:03.892 --> 00:03:05.725
the square root of 34.

00:03:06.669 --> 00:03:10.017
Now, the key is, is the square root of 34

00:03:10.017 --> 00:03:13.757
less than six, greater
than six, or equal to six?

00:03:13.757 --> 00:03:16.954
Well, we know that six is equal to

00:03:16.954 --> 00:03:19.425
the square root of 36,
so the square root of

00:03:19.425 --> 00:03:21.995
34 is less than the square root of 36,

00:03:21.995 --> 00:03:24.105
so I could write the square root of 34 is

00:03:24.105 --> 00:03:26.319
less than the square root of 36,

00:03:26.319 --> 00:03:29.824
and so the square root
of 34 is less than six.

00:03:29.824 --> 00:03:32.654
These are the square root of 36, is six.

00:03:32.654 --> 00:03:34.473
And so since the distance between

00:03:34.473 --> 00:03:37.890
C and P is less than six, we are going to

00:03:38.904 --> 00:03:41.487
be on the inside of the circle.

00:03:42.402 --> 00:03:44.720
If I somehow got square root of 36 here,

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:45.699
then we'd be on the circle,

00:03:45.699 --> 00:03:48.170
and if I somehow got
square root of 37 here,

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:51.870
or something larger, we would
have been outside the circle.
