SUSAN MOLINARI: I want to
welcome everybody, and thank

00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:03.891
you for being here.

00:00:03.891 --> 00:00:05.130
My name is Susan Molinari.

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:07.880
I'm Vice President of Public
Policy and Government Relations

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:08.980
here at Google.

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:11.320
I want to thank you so much
for joining us here today,

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:14.560
to listen to our speakers
Eric Weiner and Vint Cerf.

00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:17.100
We're excited to be hosting
Eric, author of the "New York

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:19.720
Times" best seller, "The
Geography of Bliss,"

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:21.710
to discuss his
recent book, and soon

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:24.740
to be best seller, "The
Geography of Genius."

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:29.170
And speaking of genius, let me
welcome my dear friend Senator

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:30.490
Kirsten Gillibrand.

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:33.590
Thank you so much-- and her
husband Jonathan for being here

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:34.390
with us today.

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:36.598
Oh, you have got to give
applause for a United States

00:00:36.598 --> 00:00:38.080
Senator from New York.

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:39.180
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:40.880
There you go.

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:42.230
Better.

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:44.270
Here in our DC
office, we are often

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:47.400
translators that help
explain Silicon Valley

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:49.890
to Washington, and vice versa.

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:51.960
So I'm looking forward
to hearing more from Eric

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:53.990
today about what he
uncovered during his time

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:56.180
in Silicon Valley,
and what he found

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:58.490
that it has in common with
certain places in time

00:00:58.490 --> 00:01:01.850
and history from Athens,
to Vienna, to Calcutta.

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:04.099
Eric has reported on
more than 30 nations

00:01:04.099 --> 00:01:06.900
as a longtime foreign
correspondent for NPR,

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:10.240
and also writes a regular
column for BBC travel.

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:12.230
And of course, I
do not think I need

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:16.310
to introduce Vint Cerf to
everyone in this audience.

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:18.770
I know Eric has some thoughts
about self-declared genius,

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:20.500
but it's perfectly
fine for me to let

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:23.850
you know that we have a true
creative genius on this stage

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:24.350
today.

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:25.917
Vint Cerf.

00:01:25.917 --> 00:01:27.750
We're honored to call
Vint a colleague here,

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:31.860
as Vice President and Chief
Internet Evangelist of Google.

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:34.770
And as I often remind Vint,
that if it weren't for Vint,

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:36.130
none of us would be here today.

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:40.090
So we thank you for employing
all of us here at Google, Vint.

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:42.590
I'm looking forward to hearing
more about the questions Eric

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:45.710
grapples with in his book,
from why genius seems like such

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:49.740
a boys club, or why we shouldn't
be surprised that there are not

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:52.120
more modern day
Einstein's and Mozart's.

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:54.805
So without further delay, I
hand it over to you, Vint.

00:01:54.805 --> 00:01:55.305
Thank you.

00:01:55.305 --> 00:01:57.010
VINT CERF: Thank very,
very much, Susan.

00:01:57.010 --> 00:01:57.718
Welcome everyone.

00:01:57.718 --> 00:01:59.690
[APPLAUSE]

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:04.710
So Susan actually did
everything that I was going

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:06.690
to do, so thank you for that.

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:10.440
It just shows you the way
we all think very similarly

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:13.410
here at Google, so we can
substitute for each other.

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:15.330
Thank you very much for that.

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:18.410
Eric, first of all, thank you
very much for taking the time

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:19.130
to do this.

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:20.380
ERIC WEINER: It's my pleasure.

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:23.270
VINT CERF: Thank you for writing
a book that, I think, all of us

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:25.470
will find very interesting.

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:28.490
But I need to start
out with the question,

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:30.530
why did you write this book?

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:32.660
What motivated this?

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:33.430
ERIC WEINER: OK.

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:35.600
Unlike you, Vint,
I'm not a genius.

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:38.674
I want to be clear, because
that comes up often.

00:02:38.674 --> 00:02:41.090
People want to know, you wrote
a book with the word genius

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:44.160
in the title, are you a genius?

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:45.100
I am not.

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:48.940
I have got a spouse, and
others who will vouch for that.

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:52.580
But this puts me in a
minority, because we

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:54.000
throw the word around a lot.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.280
We have marketing geniuses,
and football geniuses,

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:00.680
and political geniuses.

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:07.750
But I felt that the word was
being devalued, and being

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:09.450
misunderstood.

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:14.800
That we focus so much on
either the genetics factor,

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:19.340
or the hard work that we've
been ignoring, the environment.

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:22.270
And I will confess that
I'm a place person.

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:25.970
There are dog people, and cat
people, and people people.

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:26.810
I'm a place person.

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:29.850
Seriously, I see the world
through the prism of place.

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:32.330
And by place, I
really mean culture.

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:37.990
And I think, so often we are
like the fish in a fish tank.

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:41.070
The water, the tank,
is the culture.

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:43.790
And we're unaware of it
because we've been born in it,

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:45.270
we've lived our
whole lives in it,

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:47.640
we've been swimming
around in it.

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:50.010
Now as a foreign
correspondent for NPR,

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:52.060
I was able to step out
of my own particular fish

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:55.770
tank for a decade, and dip
into other people's fish tanks.

00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:58.600
Which is wonderful because
you can understand their tanks

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:02.590
better, and then when you
return to your own tank,

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:05.560
you're able to see it,
I think, more clearly.

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:07.150
And that's why
probably the greatest

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:10.360
book on American democracy was
written by Frenchman Alexis de

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:11.450
Tocqueville.

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:12.800
I believe place matters.

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:14.340
I believe culture matters.

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:16.610
And it struck me that,
gosh, it really matters

00:04:16.610 --> 00:04:19.610
for one of the most important
things in our lives today,

00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:21.459
which is creative genius.

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:23.200
It matters a lot.

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:25.570
And I wanted to explore that.

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:28.820
VINT CERF: So you chose a
particular collection of cities

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:31.210
to go to, and now
that you told us

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:33.940
the secret of your
interest, which

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:36.290
is place, why those places?

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:37.360
ERIC WEINER: OK.

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:42.500
Before we get to that, can I
clarify what I mean by genius?

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:43.160
VINT CERF: Yes.

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:47.460
ERIC WEINER: Because that trips
people up, and they wonder,

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:51.330
when they see the word
genius, do I mean a high IQ?

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:53.150
VINT CERF: What would
you have said, if I

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:55.520
had said no when you ask that?

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:58.320
I'm always curious about
that, when people say, may I?

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:00.590
And if you say, no,
what do they do?

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:01.880
Please go ahead Eric.

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:05.030
ERIC WEINER: I don't know
what I would have done.

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:07.380
VINT CERF: How should
we interpret genius?

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:11.582
Either generically, or maybe
in the context of your book?

00:05:11.582 --> 00:05:13.290
ERIC WEINER: I'll tell
you what it's not.

00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:14.680
It's not intelligence.

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:16.500
It's not IQ.

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:19.820
And so often, I think we
associate genius with someone

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:24.640
with a high IQ of 220,
a member of MENSA,

00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:29.340
or know-it-all who has a
vast amount of knowledge.

00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:32.100
The genius is not a
know-it-all, they're

00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:33.440
much more of a see-it-all.

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:36.280
They see connections
that others don't.

00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:39.920
So I'm talking about
creative genius.

00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:42.650
Creating something that
others haven't, that

00:05:42.650 --> 00:05:45.240
will affect people's lives.

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:48.250
And it's about making
a conceptual leap.

00:05:48.250 --> 00:05:51.890
One of my favorite quotes
about the definition of genius

00:05:51.890 --> 00:05:55.170
is from the German
philosopher Schopenhauer.

00:05:55.170 --> 00:05:58.280
He said that talent hits a
target no one else can hit,

00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:00.882
but genius hits a target
no one else can see.

00:06:00.882 --> 00:06:01.840
VINT CERF: I like that.

00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:03.320
ERIC WEINER: And I would
add that once you've

00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:04.820
hit the target no
one else can see,

00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:07.540
it's really important that
other people then see it.

00:06:07.540 --> 00:06:09.790
Because otherwise,
you're just a nut job

00:06:09.790 --> 00:06:14.040
hitting invisible targets.

00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:16.800
And this is how it fits
into the theme of my book,

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:19.570
genius is a social verdict.

00:06:19.570 --> 00:06:22.360
And I know this makes people
some people uncomfortable,

00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:24.540
but it really is.

00:06:24.540 --> 00:06:26.030
We get to decide
who are geniuses.

00:06:26.030 --> 00:06:28.040
VINT CERF: Does
that mean that there

00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:31.500
are people who might be geniuses
in one society, who would not

00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:33.510
be considered
geniuses in another

00:06:33.510 --> 00:06:36.020
because their genius
is not recognized?

00:06:36.020 --> 00:06:36.950
ERIC WEINER: Yes.

00:06:36.950 --> 00:06:41.030
In fact I argue that you cannot
separate the creative act from

00:06:41.030 --> 00:06:43.170
the recognition of
the creative act.

00:06:43.170 --> 00:06:44.964
They are tied.

00:06:44.964 --> 00:06:47.380
VINT CERF: Let me challenge
you a little bit on the notion

00:06:47.380 --> 00:06:49.110
of creative genius.

00:06:49.110 --> 00:06:52.540
Because in some cases it's
not a matter of creation,

00:06:52.540 --> 00:06:54.580
I think it's closer to
what you said before,

00:06:54.580 --> 00:06:58.400
which is recognizing something
that others don't recognize.

00:06:58.400 --> 00:07:02.690
I had the opportunity to meet
and chat with five Nobel Prize

00:07:02.690 --> 00:07:05.680
winners over the past year.

00:07:05.680 --> 00:07:08.210
In every single case,
this is really surprising,

00:07:08.210 --> 00:07:11.490
this random sample of five
Nobel Prize winners in physics,

00:07:11.490 --> 00:07:14.630
chemistry, and so on, and
in every single case they

00:07:14.630 --> 00:07:17.390
saw something, they reported
it to their colleagues,

00:07:17.390 --> 00:07:19.730
their colleagues
rejected their report

00:07:19.730 --> 00:07:23.370
out of hand, couldn't happen,
wrong, instrument failure,

00:07:23.370 --> 00:07:25.870
brain fart, whatever it was.

00:07:25.870 --> 00:07:29.070
And it took, in
some cases, decades

00:07:29.070 --> 00:07:33.130
before what they had seen
was recognized and accepted.

00:07:33.130 --> 00:07:35.120
And in some cases
they literally had

00:07:35.120 --> 00:07:37.860
to wait until new
technology came along

00:07:37.860 --> 00:07:41.810
to see, or help others
see, what they had seen,

00:07:41.810 --> 00:07:44.620
or what they had
intuitively discovered.

00:07:44.620 --> 00:07:48.010
ERIC WEINER: And I would argue
that without that second part

00:07:48.010 --> 00:07:50.140
of the equation,
the recognition,

00:07:50.140 --> 00:07:51.790
you don't have a genius.

00:07:51.790 --> 00:07:54.340
It's really a different
way of looking at it.

00:07:54.340 --> 00:07:57.470
We think of geniuses
almost as shooting stars.

00:07:57.470 --> 00:08:00.130
They appear in the night
sky every now and then,

00:08:00.130 --> 00:08:02.760
we don't know when they'll come,
but when they do we go, ooh,

00:08:02.760 --> 00:08:04.250
wow, it's beautiful.

00:08:04.250 --> 00:08:06.730
I wonder when another
one will come along?

00:08:06.730 --> 00:08:08.570
And I don't think
it works that way.

00:08:08.570 --> 00:08:12.400
I think the better
metaphor is a garden, where

00:08:12.400 --> 00:08:15.290
you need the seed, which
represents genetic talent.

00:08:15.290 --> 00:08:17.780
You need the water
and the plowing,

00:08:17.780 --> 00:08:20.460
which represents the hard work,
another important component

00:08:20.460 --> 00:08:21.230
of genius.

00:08:21.230 --> 00:08:24.010
But you need the right
soil, and the right climate,

00:08:24.010 --> 00:08:29.464
and without that, you
don't have creative genius.

00:08:29.464 --> 00:08:31.130
VINT CERF: So I
actually think that this

00:08:31.130 --> 00:08:34.299
is indicative of why Silicon
Valley has been so successful.

00:08:34.299 --> 00:08:37.950
Because the climate there, and
I don't mean just the weather,

00:08:37.950 --> 00:08:42.299
is remarkably nurturing
of people with new ideas.

00:08:42.299 --> 00:08:44.430
I've watched people
from India, who were not

00:08:44.430 --> 00:08:48.160
very successful in India, come
to Silicon Valley and blossom,

00:08:48.160 --> 00:08:51.090
because their ideas
have taken root.

00:08:51.090 --> 00:08:53.120
And they've been able
to get sustenance

00:08:53.120 --> 00:08:54.698
in order to pursue those ideas.

00:08:58.200 --> 00:08:59.690
I want to go back
to your fishbowl

00:08:59.690 --> 00:09:01.340
for a minute, because
I admit to you,

00:09:01.340 --> 00:09:02.470
the first thing
I thought of when

00:09:02.470 --> 00:09:04.636
you said you were swimming
around in your fish bowl,

00:09:04.636 --> 00:09:06.240
was WC Fields.

00:09:06.240 --> 00:09:08.760
When somebody asked him, do
you want a glass of water?

00:09:08.760 --> 00:09:11.040
And he said no, I
never touch the stuff.

00:09:11.040 --> 00:09:12.579
Then he went on to
explain why not,

00:09:12.579 --> 00:09:15.120
and it had something to do with
fish, and their reproduction,

00:09:15.120 --> 00:09:17.810
and so on.

00:09:17.810 --> 00:09:20.510
What was it like going from
one fish bowl to another?

00:09:23.680 --> 00:09:25.150
When you were in
India for almost,

00:09:25.150 --> 00:09:26.279
what, 20 years, or more?

00:09:26.279 --> 00:09:28.070
ERIC WEINER: I lived
there for a few years,

00:09:28.070 --> 00:09:31.120
and I've been going back
and forth for 20 years.

00:09:31.120 --> 00:09:31.950
It's helpful.

00:09:31.950 --> 00:09:33.970
I think we should all go
into other fish bowls,

00:09:33.970 --> 00:09:35.660
and return to our own fish bowl.

00:09:35.660 --> 00:09:38.810
That was actually the most
enlightening part of it,

00:09:38.810 --> 00:09:41.770
was coming back to the US
after 10 years overseas,

00:09:41.770 --> 00:09:45.940
and everything that I had
taken for granted struck me.

00:09:45.940 --> 00:09:48.930
And I almost went
into apoplectic shock

00:09:48.930 --> 00:09:52.740
in the Whole Foods
bread department,

00:09:52.740 --> 00:09:56.500
because just the amount
of choice and abundance

00:09:56.500 --> 00:09:58.390
that was available.

00:09:58.390 --> 00:09:59.640
I froze up.

00:09:59.640 --> 00:10:03.080
And I needed an intervention.

00:10:03.080 --> 00:10:04.940
And now, of course,
I'm used to it.

00:10:04.940 --> 00:10:06.980
But those are
precious times, when

00:10:06.980 --> 00:10:10.470
you're able to see a culture
freshly for the first time.

00:10:10.470 --> 00:10:14.050
VINT CERF: I want to take
you to the beginning.

00:10:14.050 --> 00:10:15.510
This is on page one.

00:10:15.510 --> 00:10:18.310
If you happen to have the
book, you can follow along.

00:10:18.310 --> 00:10:19.810
I want to read these
two paragraphs.

00:10:19.810 --> 00:10:20.840
ERIC WEINER: Ooh.

00:10:20.840 --> 00:10:21.340
OK.

00:10:21.340 --> 00:10:25.200
VINT CERF: Because you
were trying to explain

00:10:25.200 --> 00:10:26.580
where this book came from.

00:10:26.580 --> 00:10:29.910
He said, "people began to
recognize my specialness when

00:10:29.910 --> 00:10:31.570
I was young.

00:10:31.570 --> 00:10:34.550
As a 10-year-old, curious
about the laws of physics,

00:10:34.550 --> 00:10:37.070
I wondered what would happen
if I tossed a large water

00:10:37.070 --> 00:10:41.390
balloon off the balcony of my
father's 15th floor apartment?

00:10:41.390 --> 00:10:44.180
So following in the footsteps
of Newton and Darwin

00:10:44.180 --> 00:10:45.880
and great scientists
everywhere, I

00:10:45.880 --> 00:10:49.060
decided to conduct
an experiment.

00:10:49.060 --> 00:10:52.090
'Way to go, Einstein,' said
the clearly impressed owner

00:10:52.090 --> 00:10:54.860
of the car, whose windshield
had been thoroughly shattered

00:10:54.860 --> 00:10:58.220
by the surprising blast
force of the water balloon.

00:10:58.220 --> 00:10:59.440
Who knew?

00:10:59.440 --> 00:11:01.720
Such is the cost of
scientific progress,

00:11:01.720 --> 00:11:03.580
I rationalized that the time.

00:11:03.580 --> 00:11:06.350
Another incident years
later involved a fireplace,

00:11:06.350 --> 00:11:09.300
a closed flue, and the
local fire department.

00:11:09.300 --> 00:11:11.870
I can still hear the
firefighters words,

00:11:11.870 --> 00:11:15.440
'what are you, some sort of
genius?'" So that's the real

00:11:15.440 --> 00:11:16.920
gestation of this thing.

00:11:16.920 --> 00:11:18.440
It's the water balloon.

00:11:18.440 --> 00:11:19.210
ERIC WEINER: Thank you
for sharing that with--

00:11:19.210 --> 00:11:19.760
VINT CERF: You're welcome.

00:11:19.760 --> 00:11:20.300
ERIC WEINER: --everyone here.

00:11:20.300 --> 00:11:22.355
VINT CERF: Hey, you shared
it on the first page.

00:11:22.355 --> 00:11:23.630
ERIC WEINER: I know.

00:11:23.630 --> 00:11:26.740
You're right.

00:11:26.740 --> 00:11:27.660
Yeah.

00:11:27.660 --> 00:11:29.500
I only know one
historical character

00:11:29.500 --> 00:11:31.380
who ever declared
themselves a genius,

00:11:31.380 --> 00:11:33.910
and that was Gertrude Stein.

00:11:33.910 --> 00:11:37.180
A woman who said, "I am genius."

00:11:37.180 --> 00:11:41.930
Most people do not, which I
think is largely a good thing.

00:11:41.930 --> 00:11:45.160
Because I really argue
in this book that

00:11:45.160 --> 00:11:48.310
humility, and actually,
ignorance, which I displayed,

00:11:48.310 --> 00:11:51.230
I think, mightily in
that section there.

00:11:51.230 --> 00:11:55.160
Ignorance is really essential
to the creative process.

00:11:55.160 --> 00:11:58.350
And I think all creative
people in places

00:11:58.350 --> 00:12:03.120
always have a degree of,
what one poet described

00:12:03.120 --> 00:12:04.340
as "shiny ignorance."

00:12:04.340 --> 00:12:05.340
And I love that phrase.

00:12:05.340 --> 00:12:06.277
Shiny ignorance.

00:12:06.277 --> 00:12:07.610
VINT CERF: Well it's certainly--

00:12:07.610 --> 00:12:08.820
ERIC WEINER: It's
helpful, right?

00:12:08.820 --> 00:12:10.736
VINT CERF: I don't know
about the rest of you,

00:12:10.736 --> 00:12:14.490
but the longer I live, the more
I realized how little I know,

00:12:14.490 --> 00:12:16.480
and the older I get,
the lesser I know,

00:12:16.480 --> 00:12:20.000
until finally I know practically
nothing about anything.

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:22.070
I want to turn to page
three for a minute,

00:12:22.070 --> 00:12:26.890
and that's the Galton Box, at
University College, London.

00:12:26.890 --> 00:12:29.220
A place of personal
interest to me

00:12:29.220 --> 00:12:31.370
because I worked with one
of the professors there,

00:12:31.370 --> 00:12:33.790
Peter Kirstein, for
many, many years now,

00:12:33.790 --> 00:12:37.400
but what was the
Galton Box all about?

00:12:37.400 --> 00:12:39.960
ERIC WEINER: It is the worldly
possessions of one Sir Francis

00:12:39.960 --> 00:12:40.637
Galton.

00:12:40.637 --> 00:12:41.220
VINT CERF: OK.

00:12:41.220 --> 00:12:44.420
ERIC WEINER: 19th century
elite British scientist.

00:12:44.420 --> 00:12:46.860
He brought us the phrase,
nature versus nurture.

00:12:46.860 --> 00:12:52.860
He was the first one to use
forensics fingerprinting.

00:12:52.860 --> 00:12:54.890
He was one of the
first meteorologists.

00:12:54.890 --> 00:12:58.510
He had an IQ,
supposedly, of 200.

00:12:58.510 --> 00:13:01.650
And he was an odd bird.

00:13:01.650 --> 00:13:04.496
Even odder than most
British people--

00:13:04.496 --> 00:13:06.680
[LAUGHS]

00:13:06.680 --> 00:13:08.230
--to be honest.

00:13:08.230 --> 00:13:11.000
He was a numbers person.

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:13.762
He wanted to measure things.

00:13:13.762 --> 00:13:15.220
Before he can
explain something, he

00:13:15.220 --> 00:13:18.140
said he had to disembarrass
it of words first.

00:13:18.140 --> 00:13:20.360
So one of the weirdest
things that Galton did

00:13:20.360 --> 00:13:23.300
was, he wanted to create
a beauty map of the United

00:13:23.300 --> 00:13:24.240
Kingdom.

00:13:24.240 --> 00:13:26.590
But he was too shy to
actually look at women,

00:13:26.590 --> 00:13:30.050
or hold a beauty contest, which
wasn't really done back then,

00:13:30.050 --> 00:13:33.770
so he stuck some felt into
his pocket, and had some pins,

00:13:33.770 --> 00:13:36.527
and traveled all over the UK.

00:13:36.527 --> 00:13:38.610
And if he saw an attractive
woman, in his opinion,

00:13:38.610 --> 00:13:41.790
he put four pins in the
felt. Less attractive, three.

00:13:41.790 --> 00:13:42.772
Then two, then one.

00:13:42.772 --> 00:13:45.105
VINT CERF: I thought he was
going to stick them with it.

00:13:45.105 --> 00:13:46.210
ERIC WEINER: No.

00:13:46.210 --> 00:13:47.850
He concluded, the
most attractive women

00:13:47.850 --> 00:13:49.516
were in London, and
the least attractive

00:13:49.516 --> 00:13:50.980
in Aberdeen, Scotland.

00:13:50.980 --> 00:13:53.670
Probably not accounting for the
difference in population size.

00:13:53.670 --> 00:13:56.730
So he wasn't perfect, but the
reason that we care about him,

00:13:56.730 --> 00:13:58.130
that I care about
him, is that he

00:13:58.130 --> 00:14:03.070
wrote a book in 1860-something,
called "Hereditary Genius."

00:14:03.070 --> 00:14:08.130
And this really solidified
in many people's minds,

00:14:08.130 --> 00:14:10.780
and affects us to this day,
this notion that genius

00:14:10.780 --> 00:14:13.330
is born, that it's innate.

00:14:13.330 --> 00:14:14.300
It must be genetic.

00:14:14.300 --> 00:14:17.080
You see someone like Mozart
playing the piano at age 3,

00:14:17.080 --> 00:14:19.950
and composing at age
7 and 8, and we think,

00:14:19.950 --> 00:14:22.145
well, it's got to be genetic.

00:14:24.865 --> 00:14:26.420
He was writing in
the 19th century,

00:14:26.420 --> 00:14:32.780
he had some unfortunate,
well, chapters.

00:14:32.780 --> 00:14:39.180
He had a chapter called The
Comparative Worth of Races.

00:14:39.180 --> 00:14:41.520
And women only appeared
briefly in his book,

00:14:41.520 --> 00:14:45.910
in a chapter entitled
Literary Men.

00:14:45.910 --> 00:14:49.470
He was a creature
of his time, but he

00:14:49.470 --> 00:14:53.380
was the first to really study
creativity scientifically.

00:14:53.380 --> 00:14:55.590
And the first always
never gets it right.

00:14:55.590 --> 00:14:59.760
As Steve Jobs said of the light
bulb, when Edison invented it,

00:14:59.760 --> 00:15:03.860
no one complained that
the wattage was too low.

00:15:03.860 --> 00:15:05.570
And so it was with Galton.

00:15:05.570 --> 00:15:08.540
And so we've been trying to
study creativity ever since.

00:15:08.540 --> 00:15:11.615
There is a thriving
field of creatologists,

00:15:11.615 --> 00:15:12.490
they call themselves.

00:15:12.490 --> 00:15:13.365
VINT CERF: Oh my god.

00:15:13.365 --> 00:15:15.790
ERIC WEINER: Science of genius.

00:15:15.790 --> 00:15:18.940
Mainly psychologists,
but also economists,

00:15:18.940 --> 00:15:22.860
trying to figure out not
only what kind of people

00:15:22.860 --> 00:15:25.440
are the most creative, but
really what interests me,

00:15:25.440 --> 00:15:28.120
where does creativity
take place?

00:15:28.120 --> 00:15:30.290
There's a field called
historiometrics,

00:15:30.290 --> 00:15:33.349
which uses statistical
analysis to look at this.

00:15:33.349 --> 00:15:34.890
VINT CERF: That was
the next question

00:15:34.890 --> 00:15:39.500
I was going to ask,
so thank you for that.

00:15:39.500 --> 00:15:44.420
Historiometrics sounds
a lot like Hari Seldon

00:15:44.420 --> 00:15:48.280
in the Foundation
series, by Isaac Asimov.

00:15:48.280 --> 00:15:51.130
Seldon had this idea
called psychohistory.

00:15:51.130 --> 00:15:51.880
ERIC WEINER: Yeah.

00:15:51.880 --> 00:15:53.296
VINT CERF: And he
thought that you

00:15:53.296 --> 00:15:57.490
could analyze great swaths of
behavior across the galaxy,

00:15:57.490 --> 00:15:59.640
and make predictions
about how things work.

00:15:59.640 --> 00:16:02.455
Is that what historiometrics--

00:16:02.455 --> 00:16:03.830
ERIC WEINER:
Historiometrics will

00:16:03.830 --> 00:16:07.390
look back at these
golden ages and find

00:16:07.390 --> 00:16:10.030
ways of measuring eminence.

00:16:10.030 --> 00:16:12.130
Who was great?

00:16:12.130 --> 00:16:16.290
And then, what were the
conditions at the time?

00:16:16.290 --> 00:16:18.600
Just one example
was Dean Simonton,

00:16:18.600 --> 00:16:21.140
professor at University
of California, Davis,

00:16:21.140 --> 00:16:25.180
looked at Japan
over a long period.

00:16:25.180 --> 00:16:27.585
From about 500 AD to 1940.

00:16:27.585 --> 00:16:28.210
VINT CERF: Wow.

00:16:28.210 --> 00:16:29.940
ERIC WEINER: Just
before World War II.

00:16:29.940 --> 00:16:31.750
And he compared two variables.

00:16:31.750 --> 00:16:41.935
He compared the amount of
extracultural influx, which

00:16:41.935 --> 00:16:44.310
sounds like something you may
need to go to the emergency

00:16:44.310 --> 00:16:45.755
room for, but in fact--

00:16:45.755 --> 00:16:47.935
VINT CERF: Either that
or Montezuma's revenge.

00:16:47.935 --> 00:16:50.310
ERIC WEINER: --it is openness
to experience, essentially.

00:16:50.310 --> 00:16:52.490
Its openness in
terms of immigration.

00:16:52.490 --> 00:16:55.340
In terms of student exchanges.

00:16:55.340 --> 00:16:56.940
In every sense of the word.

00:16:56.940 --> 00:16:58.520
And he compared
that one variable,

00:16:58.520 --> 00:17:00.910
extracultural influence,
on the one hand,

00:17:00.910 --> 00:17:04.740
and Japanese achievement
in the arts and sciences

00:17:04.740 --> 00:17:05.490
on the other hand.

00:17:05.490 --> 00:17:07.087
And he found a
direct correlation.

00:17:07.087 --> 00:17:09.420
It was interesting for Japan,
because traditionally it's

00:17:09.420 --> 00:17:11.260
a very closed
society, but it's had

00:17:11.260 --> 00:17:12.579
these moments of opening up.

00:17:12.579 --> 00:17:17.410
And the more open Japan was
to this extracultural influx,

00:17:17.410 --> 00:17:18.569
the more to achieved.

00:17:18.569 --> 00:17:22.170
In all kinds of fields, not just
the arts, but also in science.

00:17:22.170 --> 00:17:27.495
And it's interesting that it's
partly allowing immigrants in.

00:17:27.495 --> 00:17:31.259
And immigrants are more likely
to become creative geniuses.

00:17:31.259 --> 00:17:33.300
But I also think there's
something else going on.

00:17:33.300 --> 00:17:37.290
I think that there's a
creativity contagion,

00:17:37.290 --> 00:17:40.290
once you open up
yourself to, what I call,

00:17:40.290 --> 00:17:42.730
the possibility of possibility.

00:17:42.730 --> 00:17:44.680
Say you've only eaten
with a fork and knife.

00:17:44.680 --> 00:17:47.320
You don't believe there's any
other way to eat your food.

00:17:47.320 --> 00:17:49.920
And here comes someone from
China eating with chopsticks,

00:17:49.920 --> 00:17:52.570
or someone from South India
eating with their hands.

00:17:52.570 --> 00:17:54.050
Now chances are,
you are not going

00:17:54.050 --> 00:17:56.530
to just start using
chopsticks all the time,

00:17:56.530 --> 00:17:58.010
or eating with your hands.

00:17:58.010 --> 00:18:01.174
But you have been opened up to
the possibility of possibility.

00:18:01.174 --> 00:18:02.590
And you may think,
well if there's

00:18:02.590 --> 00:18:04.390
a different way
of eating my food,

00:18:04.390 --> 00:18:07.160
maybe there's a different way
of constructing a building,

00:18:07.160 --> 00:18:11.260
or coding, or thinking
about whatever.

00:18:11.260 --> 00:18:13.930
And I think that's
the main reason

00:18:13.930 --> 00:18:15.670
we see that relationship.

00:18:15.670 --> 00:18:18.610
VINT CERF: So you have
something on page 25,

00:18:18.610 --> 00:18:20.980
for those of you
following along,

00:18:20.980 --> 00:18:24.900
it says the expectation
of a reward or evaluation,

00:18:24.900 --> 00:18:28.929
even a positive evaluation,
squelched creativity.

00:18:28.929 --> 00:18:30.220
ERIC WEINER: In the laboratory.

00:18:33.960 --> 00:18:35.305
VINT CERF: I'm sorry, Teresa--

00:18:35.305 --> 00:18:36.180
ERIC WEINER: Amabile.

00:18:36.180 --> 00:18:37.300
VINT CERF: Amabile.

00:18:37.300 --> 00:18:39.910
She says it's intrinsic
theory of motivation.

00:18:39.910 --> 00:18:41.540
People will be
most creative when

00:18:41.540 --> 00:18:44.550
they feel motivated primarily
by interest, enjoyment,

00:18:44.550 --> 00:18:46.780
satisfaction, and challenge
of the work itself,

00:18:46.780 --> 00:18:48.160
not by external pressures.

00:18:48.160 --> 00:18:50.912
And I thought that was a
very interesting observation.

00:18:50.912 --> 00:18:53.120
ERIC WEINER: And it gave me
a headache, to be honest.

00:18:53.120 --> 00:18:55.690
Because it was one
of the few cases,

00:18:55.690 --> 00:18:58.280
actually, where I saw a
direct conflict between what

00:18:58.280 --> 00:19:01.220
psychologists are
finding in the lab,

00:19:01.220 --> 00:19:03.640
and what the real
world tells us.

00:19:03.640 --> 00:19:06.195
So in the lab, exactly.

00:19:06.195 --> 00:19:08.210
Teresa Amabile at Harvard,
and her colleagues,

00:19:08.210 --> 00:19:10.043
would do an experiment
where, typically they

00:19:10.043 --> 00:19:13.910
would take two groups of
starving undergrads who need

00:19:13.910 --> 00:19:15.725
the extra money, let's face it.

00:19:15.725 --> 00:19:16.850
VINT CERF: I remember that.

00:19:16.850 --> 00:19:18.225
ERIC WEINER: These
are the people

00:19:18.225 --> 00:19:20.510
who are used in these
experiments, but fine.

00:19:20.510 --> 00:19:22.660
And they were both told
to build a collage.

00:19:22.660 --> 00:19:26.260
And one group was
given material,

00:19:26.260 --> 00:19:27.920
and said build a collage.

00:19:27.920 --> 00:19:30.070
You'll be judged on the collage.

00:19:30.070 --> 00:19:31.470
The results will be made public.

00:19:31.470 --> 00:19:33.011
If you do a really
good job, you will

00:19:33.011 --> 00:19:36.410
receive $150, which is
a lot for an undergrad.

00:19:36.410 --> 00:19:39.290
The other group was told build
the collage, and just have fun.

00:19:39.290 --> 00:19:42.410
I should add that they didn't
have any artistic experience.

00:19:42.410 --> 00:19:44.790
And it was the second
group that was told just

00:19:44.790 --> 00:19:47.300
to have fun that did better.

00:19:47.300 --> 00:19:49.270
Now where this conflicts
with the real world

00:19:49.270 --> 00:19:51.910
is that looking historically,
a lot of these golden ages,

00:19:51.910 --> 00:19:54.030
and at Silicon
Valley today, these

00:19:54.030 --> 00:19:55.770
are competitive places, right?

00:19:55.770 --> 00:19:56.610
VINT CERF: Yes.

00:19:56.610 --> 00:19:58.800
ERIC WEINER: In Florence,
Michelangelo and Leonardo

00:19:58.800 --> 00:19:59.580
hated each other.

00:19:59.580 --> 00:20:03.301
It's just one example,
how to square that circle.

00:20:03.301 --> 00:20:05.800
VINT CERF: Was that competition,
or was that something else?

00:20:05.800 --> 00:20:07.299
No Not to go down
this little alley,

00:20:07.299 --> 00:20:08.970
here, they just didn't
like each other?

00:20:08.970 --> 00:20:12.380
Or they thought each
other's work was terrible?

00:20:12.380 --> 00:20:16.170
ERIC WEINER: They didn't like
each other, and they competed.

00:20:16.170 --> 00:20:18.150
And Silicon Valley
is competitive,

00:20:18.150 --> 00:20:22.190
and Athens was competitive
in its own way.

00:20:22.190 --> 00:20:24.780
And you see athletes
that perform better

00:20:24.780 --> 00:20:28.540
on the day of the race
than they do in training.

00:20:28.540 --> 00:20:31.520
I found one study that I
think does square the circle.

00:20:31.520 --> 00:20:33.960
It was a study of
musicians, but these

00:20:33.960 --> 00:20:35.810
were experienced musicians.

00:20:35.810 --> 00:20:38.260
These people had at least
five, 10 years experience.

00:20:38.260 --> 00:20:39.820
And they were told to improvise.

00:20:39.820 --> 00:20:41.810
Jazz improvisation.

00:20:41.810 --> 00:20:44.810
Again, one group given
intrinsic motivation, just

00:20:44.810 --> 00:20:47.340
have fun, and the other group
extrinsic motivation, money,

00:20:47.340 --> 00:20:49.110
reward, recognition.

00:20:49.110 --> 00:20:51.650
And in this case it was the
second group that did better.

00:20:51.650 --> 00:20:54.630
And I think the difference
is, when you're beginning

00:20:54.630 --> 00:20:57.960
in a creative task or a skill.

00:20:57.960 --> 00:21:02.330
Playing a musical instrument,
coding, whatever it is.

00:21:02.330 --> 00:21:04.250
I don't think competition helps.

00:21:04.250 --> 00:21:05.350
I think it stymies you.

00:21:05.350 --> 00:21:09.070
But I think once you've achieved
a certain degree of mastery,

00:21:09.070 --> 00:21:11.960
that competition
can raise your game.

00:21:11.960 --> 00:21:14.190
That's my take on it.

00:21:14.190 --> 00:21:17.780
VINT CERF: There is another
comment that's on page 28,

00:21:17.780 --> 00:21:21.540
basically saying paradise
is antithetical to genius.

00:21:21.540 --> 00:21:24.375
And the reason is, it
makes no demands on us.

00:21:24.375 --> 00:21:27.600
In paradise, you just
relax and enjoy yourself.

00:21:27.600 --> 00:21:33.750
And I remember in high school,
writing my valedictory comments

00:21:33.750 --> 00:21:36.330
called, "In Praise
of Discontent,"

00:21:36.330 --> 00:21:39.020
and I remember thinking, nothing
happens unless somebody is not

00:21:39.020 --> 00:21:40.460
satisfied.

00:21:40.460 --> 00:21:42.470
And so it feels to
me like there may

00:21:42.470 --> 00:21:44.240
be an element of
that hiding in here.

00:21:44.240 --> 00:21:46.380
ERIC WEINER: Were you a
curmudgeon, even back then?

00:21:46.380 --> 00:21:48.670
VINT CERF: I didn't think of
this as being curmudgeonly.

00:21:48.670 --> 00:21:49.350
ERIC WEINER: No?

00:21:49.350 --> 00:21:50.320
VINT CERF: I didn't
want everybody

00:21:50.320 --> 00:21:52.070
to be unhappy all
the time, I wanted

00:21:52.070 --> 00:21:55.087
them to be just unhappy enough
that something would change.

00:21:55.087 --> 00:21:57.170
ERIC WEINER: You know I
once, during my first book

00:21:57.170 --> 00:22:01.260
"The Geography of Bliss,"
I met an Icelandic composer

00:22:01.260 --> 00:22:03.180
named Hilmar.

00:22:03.180 --> 00:22:05.140
And he was very talented.

00:22:05.140 --> 00:22:07.550
And he also seemed happy.

00:22:07.550 --> 00:22:12.580
And this was confusing
me, because I think of--

00:22:12.580 --> 00:22:14.827
VINT CERF: Artists are
suppose to be in pain.

00:22:14.827 --> 00:22:16.160
ERIC WEINER: I said that to him.

00:22:16.160 --> 00:22:18.010
I said, Hilmar, what gives?

00:22:18.010 --> 00:22:21.590
You look happy, but you're
a successful composer.

00:22:21.590 --> 00:22:23.344
You were a mentor to Bjork.

00:22:23.344 --> 00:22:25.260
And he said something
to me I'll never forget.

00:22:25.260 --> 00:22:27.370
He said, well I am
basically happy,

00:22:27.370 --> 00:22:30.630
but I cherish my melancholia.

00:22:30.630 --> 00:22:31.760
Which I think is good.

00:22:31.760 --> 00:22:35.850
We all need to have
that part of us.

00:22:35.850 --> 00:22:38.200
But you're absolutely
right, and I

00:22:38.200 --> 00:22:40.724
would like to withdraw the
curmudgeon common, please.

00:22:40.724 --> 00:22:42.140
VINT CERF: Oh
that's perfectly OK.

00:22:42.140 --> 00:22:43.349
I'll get even with you later.

00:22:43.349 --> 00:22:43.848
And

00:22:43.848 --> 00:22:44.836
ERIC WEINER: All right.

00:22:44.836 --> 00:22:46.460
Now wait, I have a
point here, and that

00:22:46.460 --> 00:22:51.160
is that paradise would be
the least creative place.

00:22:51.160 --> 00:22:55.450
That creativity is always
a response to a challenge,

00:22:55.450 --> 00:22:57.920
and that we, in
fact, thrive when

00:22:57.920 --> 00:23:00.080
presented with constraints.

00:23:00.080 --> 00:23:03.020
Robert Frost once said that
writing free verse poetry

00:23:03.020 --> 00:23:06.450
would be like playing
tennis without a net.

00:23:06.450 --> 00:23:08.150
And we need the net.

00:23:08.150 --> 00:23:13.477
And I think the problem is,
we forget that sometimes.

00:23:13.477 --> 00:23:14.810
VINT CERF: That's very Japanese.

00:23:14.810 --> 00:23:17.810
Those of you who have studied
ikebana, like Sigmund has,

00:23:17.810 --> 00:23:19.740
will tell you that the
reason it's interesting

00:23:19.740 --> 00:23:21.804
is, that there are very
tight constraints on what

00:23:21.804 --> 00:23:23.220
you're allowed to
do, and you have

00:23:23.220 --> 00:23:26.490
to be creative within those
constraints, just like haiku.

00:23:26.490 --> 00:23:29.290
And so sometimes constraints
are exactly the thing

00:23:29.290 --> 00:23:30.822
that generate creativity.

00:23:30.822 --> 00:23:31.530
ERIC WEINER: Yes.

00:23:31.530 --> 00:23:32.790
VINT CERF: So I have another--

00:23:32.790 --> 00:23:33.470
ERIC WEINER: Sure.

00:23:33.470 --> 00:23:35.053
VINT CERF: Here's
an observation which

00:23:35.053 --> 00:23:38.030
I resonated with
tremendously, it's on page 39.

00:23:38.030 --> 00:23:40.590
It says the results
were published

00:23:40.590 --> 00:23:43.251
in the journal "Consciousness
and Cognition,"

00:23:43.251 --> 00:23:47.530
and they are enough to
make you reach for a drink.

00:23:47.530 --> 00:23:51.410
The sober men took, on average,
15.4 seconds to come up

00:23:51.410 --> 00:23:52.740
with a creative response.

00:23:52.740 --> 00:23:56.051
But the vodka drinkers
needed only 11.5 seconds.

00:23:56.051 --> 00:23:57.935
[LAUGHS]

00:23:59.210 --> 00:24:01.290
I don't drink vodka, but
I drink a lot of wine.

00:24:01.290 --> 00:24:03.060
So somehow, that
made me feel like it

00:24:03.060 --> 00:24:06.700
was an important
component of creativity.

00:24:06.700 --> 00:24:09.220
ERIC WEINER: A little bit of
alcohol makes us more creative.

00:24:09.220 --> 00:24:10.950
And it's been shown
in the studies.

00:24:10.950 --> 00:24:14.910
A lot of alcohol makes us
fall down, which is not good.

00:24:14.910 --> 00:24:19.397
But this inhibition is important
for creativity, seriously.

00:24:19.397 --> 00:24:19.980
VINT CERF: Ah.

00:24:19.980 --> 00:24:20.340
Good point.

00:24:20.340 --> 00:24:22.140
ERIC WEINER: And
there's something called

00:24:22.140 --> 00:24:24.490
the disinhibition hypothesis.

00:24:24.490 --> 00:24:27.810
These psychologists have
fancy names for everything.

00:24:27.810 --> 00:24:30.790
But you can disinhibit
yourself in many ways,

00:24:30.790 --> 00:24:33.450
and one way is with a
little bit of vodka.

00:24:33.450 --> 00:24:36.150
Another way is by
going for a walk,

00:24:36.150 --> 00:24:41.164
or actually being in the
right acoustic atmosphere.

00:24:41.164 --> 00:24:43.080
VINT CERF: I'm sorry,
in the right atmosphere?

00:24:43.080 --> 00:24:43.860
ERIC WEINER: Yes.

00:24:43.860 --> 00:24:46.670
So the ideal acoustic
setting, according

00:24:46.670 --> 00:24:49.080
to a study out of the
University of Illinois,

00:24:49.080 --> 00:24:50.330
is not complete silence.

00:24:50.330 --> 00:24:53.000
We don't do our best
thinking in a quiet room,

00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:54.040
in complete silence.

00:24:54.040 --> 00:24:57.170
Nor do we do our best
thinking in a very loud room

00:24:57.170 --> 00:24:59.100
with rock music or
construction noise.

00:24:59.100 --> 00:25:00.845
70 decibels is ideal.

00:25:00.845 --> 00:25:03.580
And that happens
to be pretty much

00:25:03.580 --> 00:25:06.640
the sound level you'd find
in a Starbucks, or a coffee

00:25:06.640 --> 00:25:07.340
shop like that.

00:25:07.340 --> 00:25:09.240
It's called the
Starbucks effect.

00:25:09.240 --> 00:25:13.750
And I think the reason is
that we defocus our attention

00:25:13.750 --> 00:25:15.090
in a situation like that.

00:25:15.090 --> 00:25:18.280
And creativity is not
about furrowing your brow

00:25:18.280 --> 00:25:21.700
and honing in on the problem,
and gritting your teeth

00:25:21.700 --> 00:25:23.010
until you get it done.

00:25:23.010 --> 00:25:25.579
It's about defocusing.

00:25:25.579 --> 00:25:27.370
Eventually you will
need to grit your teeth

00:25:27.370 --> 00:25:30.700
to get it done on a deadline,
but that comes later.

00:25:30.700 --> 00:25:34.380
The first stage is to defocus.

00:25:34.380 --> 00:25:37.177
VINT CERF: I think that this may
have an age-related component

00:25:37.177 --> 00:25:37.760
to it, though.

00:25:37.760 --> 00:25:41.740
Because I remember at Xerox
PARC, back in the '70s,

00:25:41.740 --> 00:25:43.540
there was enormous
creativity that

00:25:43.540 --> 00:25:45.670
was generated, in
part, by bean bags

00:25:45.670 --> 00:25:47.950
and white boards on the walls.

00:25:47.950 --> 00:25:50.450
And I noticed over
time that fewer of us

00:25:50.450 --> 00:25:53.330
were able to get back
out of the bean bag.

00:25:53.330 --> 00:25:56.219
We were very
distracted by trying

00:25:56.219 --> 00:25:58.760
to get out of the bean bag, and
we couldn't be very creative.

00:25:58.760 --> 00:26:00.635
ERIC WEINER: It was too
much to push against.

00:26:00.635 --> 00:26:02.260
VINT CERF: Now this
one, on page 56,

00:26:02.260 --> 00:26:03.440
really grabbed my attention.

00:26:03.440 --> 00:26:07.250
This is Diogenes,
and you describe him

00:26:07.250 --> 00:26:09.240
as "a guy who lived
in a wine barrel,

00:26:09.240 --> 00:26:12.650
and regularly ridiculed the
famous and the powerful.

00:26:12.650 --> 00:26:14.520
And after Aristotle
described man

00:26:14.520 --> 00:26:17.870
as a rational animal, a
kind of featherless bird,

00:26:17.870 --> 00:26:21.020
Diogenes plucked a chicken and
tossed it over a wall yelling,

00:26:21.020 --> 00:26:21.700
'heads up!

00:26:21.700 --> 00:26:25.920
Here comes a true man.'" So
Diogenes and the naked chicken.

00:26:25.920 --> 00:26:28.200
I think that should be the
title of your next book.

00:26:28.200 --> 00:26:31.380
ERIC WEINER: Oh that's good.

00:26:31.380 --> 00:26:34.770
Yeah, he was an oddball.

00:26:34.770 --> 00:26:37.730
And he was tolerated in Athens.

00:26:37.730 --> 00:26:43.310
And tolerating your
eccentrics is important.

00:26:43.310 --> 00:26:46.990
Adam Smith in Scotland talked
to himself walking down

00:26:46.990 --> 00:26:48.000
the street.

00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:48.734
He really did.

00:26:48.734 --> 00:26:50.900
VINT CERF: Sounds like San
Francisco, Market Street,

00:26:50.900 --> 00:26:51.582
doesn't it?

00:26:51.582 --> 00:26:52.850
[LAUGHS]

00:26:52.850 --> 00:26:56.950
ERIC WEINER: You need to
tolerate your eccentrics,

00:26:56.950 --> 00:26:59.970
but you also need
to know when to stop

00:26:59.970 --> 00:27:02.760
listening to them as well.

00:27:02.760 --> 00:27:06.180
I'll just give you an
example from Vienna.

00:27:06.180 --> 00:27:09.520
Freud thought he was
going crazy sometimes,

00:27:09.520 --> 00:27:12.210
because he was in
uncharted territory.

00:27:12.210 --> 00:27:14.310
He called himself
a conquistador,

00:27:14.310 --> 00:27:16.620
and he needed a
fellow conquistador.

00:27:16.620 --> 00:27:20.180
And for him, that was a fellow
doctor named Wilhelm Fliess.

00:27:20.180 --> 00:27:23.830
Now at the time they were both
Jewish doctors, in Austria,

00:27:23.830 --> 00:27:26.590
with strange ideas.

00:27:26.590 --> 00:27:28.630
Freud had this idea
about the unconscious,

00:27:28.630 --> 00:27:32.450
and Wilhelm Fliess had these
strange ideas about the nose.

00:27:32.450 --> 00:27:34.960
He thought the nose was
the most important organ.

00:27:34.960 --> 00:27:37.952
He thought, and I'm not making
this up, it was a sexual organ.

00:27:37.952 --> 00:27:38.660
And he believed--

00:27:38.660 --> 00:27:41.550
VINT CERF: Well, dogs
would tell you it is.

00:27:41.550 --> 00:27:43.620
ERIC WEINER: All our
problems, including sexual,

00:27:43.620 --> 00:27:47.560
could be cured if you performed
this surgery on your nose.

00:27:47.560 --> 00:27:49.710
And he performed
surgery on Freud's nose,

00:27:49.710 --> 00:27:52.416
and many other people.

00:27:52.416 --> 00:27:53.550
AUDIENCE: Oh my gosh.

00:27:53.550 --> 00:27:54.758
ERIC WEINER: Yeah, it's true.

00:27:54.758 --> 00:27:59.880
But at some point, Freud
realized, this guy is nuts.

00:27:59.880 --> 00:28:04.365
And he broke off
their friendship.

00:28:04.365 --> 00:28:06.740
And then he formed something
called the Wednesday Circle,

00:28:06.740 --> 00:28:09.690
which is a group of less
crazy, but still conquistadors

00:28:09.690 --> 00:28:11.330
who got together on Wednesdays.

00:28:11.330 --> 00:28:13.770
But the genius, when they're
out there on their own,

00:28:13.770 --> 00:28:18.760
they need some validation,
reassurance really,

00:28:18.760 --> 00:28:20.430
that they're not nuts.

00:28:20.430 --> 00:28:23.826
And sometimes you need
a fellow maverick.

00:28:23.826 --> 00:28:25.700
VINT CERF: This leads
us to two other things.

00:28:25.700 --> 00:28:29.120
On page 69 at the bottom, you
make this very interesting

00:28:29.120 --> 00:28:33.540
comment. "Places of genius
require a degree of uncertainty

00:28:33.540 --> 00:28:35.810
and perhaps even chaos."

00:28:35.810 --> 00:28:39.760
And there's a current
expression called,

00:28:39.760 --> 00:28:42.250
opportunity lies on
the edge of chaos.

00:28:42.250 --> 00:28:45.090
And I'm just wondering if you
could elaborate a bit more

00:28:45.090 --> 00:28:47.294
on the chaotic theory of genius.

00:28:47.294 --> 00:28:47.960
ERIC WEINER: OK.

00:28:47.960 --> 00:28:50.640
And there's a lot of
interest between chaos theory

00:28:50.640 --> 00:28:56.140
and genius, actually, because
there is a connection.

00:28:56.140 --> 00:28:58.320
There's a connection
on the societal level

00:28:58.320 --> 00:29:02.510
that all these places I
look at, these golden ages,

00:29:02.510 --> 00:29:05.850
shortly before they
experience their golden age,

00:29:05.850 --> 00:29:08.850
underwent some sort of upheaval.

00:29:08.850 --> 00:29:12.850
In Athens, it was the city
being sacked by the Persians

00:29:12.850 --> 00:29:15.300
before Pericles
rebuilds it grander

00:29:15.300 --> 00:29:19.050
than ever, builds the Acropolis
that we still admire today.

00:29:19.050 --> 00:29:21.710
And in Florence, just
before the Renaissance,

00:29:21.710 --> 00:29:23.600
maybe just two
generations, the city

00:29:23.600 --> 00:29:26.570
is decimated by the Black
Death, the bubonic plague.

00:29:26.570 --> 00:29:27.390
It's terrible.

00:29:27.390 --> 00:29:28.510
I don't lie about that.

00:29:28.510 --> 00:29:31.330
30% of the population
is wiped out.

00:29:31.330 --> 00:29:33.870
But that actually had an
effect of loosening up

00:29:33.870 --> 00:29:35.060
the rigid social structure.

00:29:35.060 --> 00:29:36.860
VINT CERF: This sounds like
forest fires, in a way,

00:29:36.860 --> 00:29:39.350
we've been told that we all
run around trying to put out

00:29:39.350 --> 00:29:41.300
the forest fires, and
now the forestry people

00:29:41.300 --> 00:29:42.830
are saying don't do that.

00:29:42.830 --> 00:29:46.020
That's part of the normal
process of renewal.

00:29:46.020 --> 00:29:47.090
Kind of like the Phoenix.

00:29:47.090 --> 00:29:50.030
ERIC WEINER: Yeah and you
often see that beforehand.

00:29:50.030 --> 00:29:53.230
Because you need a stirring
of the pot, a kind of chaos.

00:29:53.230 --> 00:29:57.410
And on the personal,
neural-level actually,

00:29:57.410 --> 00:29:59.850
there's a neuroscientist
named Walter Freeman, who

00:29:59.850 --> 00:30:02.130
studied rabbits
brains, and hooked them

00:30:02.130 --> 00:30:05.590
up to EEG's, and then
introduced them to odors.

00:30:05.590 --> 00:30:07.290
And some of the
odors were familiar,

00:30:07.290 --> 00:30:08.870
and some were unfamiliar.

00:30:08.870 --> 00:30:11.500
And when the rabbits
were introduced

00:30:11.500 --> 00:30:14.990
to an unfamiliar odor,
their EEG activity

00:30:14.990 --> 00:30:17.430
entered a chaotic
state, which Freeman

00:30:17.430 --> 00:30:19.620
called an "I don't know" state.

00:30:19.620 --> 00:30:22.680
And that resonated with me,
because I think we, personally,

00:30:22.680 --> 00:30:25.030
do need to reach
an "I don't know"

00:30:25.030 --> 00:30:27.490
state, which is often chaotic.

00:30:27.490 --> 00:30:31.010
If there's an old order, and
a new order, what's in between

00:30:31.010 --> 00:30:31.720
is chaos.

00:30:31.720 --> 00:30:34.760
I don't think you want to
live in chaos, necessarily,

00:30:34.760 --> 00:30:37.360
but you need to at least
transition through it.

00:30:37.360 --> 00:30:40.390
VINT CERF: Some of you will
remember Ian Bremmer, who

00:30:40.390 --> 00:30:42.820
came to talk to us
about his latest book,

00:30:42.820 --> 00:30:45.500
but one of his earlier ones
was called "The J Curve,"

00:30:45.500 --> 00:30:47.850
and there is something
very similar about what

00:30:47.850 --> 00:30:51.590
he said about societies
that are authoritarian,

00:30:51.590 --> 00:30:56.200
that try to move to a
more democratic state,

00:30:56.200 --> 00:30:57.900
go through a period of chaos.

00:30:57.900 --> 00:31:02.640
And if their economic
condition is too low

00:31:02.640 --> 00:31:04.544
when they start the
transition, they

00:31:04.544 --> 00:31:05.960
will not make it
all the way over.

00:31:05.960 --> 00:31:07.709
Either they will go
back to authoritarian,

00:31:07.709 --> 00:31:11.020
or they will disintegrate into
total chaos and not recover.

00:31:11.020 --> 00:31:12.899
ERIC WEINER: Yeah.

00:31:12.899 --> 00:31:14.690
VINT CERF: You have
something else in here,

00:31:14.690 --> 00:31:17.310
that you were speaking
about, the Song dynasty,

00:31:17.310 --> 00:31:19.400
and you talk about group genius.

00:31:19.400 --> 00:31:22.730
Can you tell us a little
more about what that means?

00:31:22.730 --> 00:31:26.280
ERIC WEINER: The West does not
have a monopoly on creativity,

00:31:26.280 --> 00:31:29.140
and on genius, so I made a point
of going to Hangzhou, China.

00:31:29.140 --> 00:31:32.030
Which, during the
12th and 13th century

00:31:32.030 --> 00:31:34.070
was the capital of
the Song dynasty,

00:31:34.070 --> 00:31:36.450
and it was an amazing place.

00:31:36.450 --> 00:31:39.540
City of a million people, while
the largest city in Europe

00:31:39.540 --> 00:31:41.000
was 50,000.

00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:43.910
And while the Europeans are
picking lice out of their hair,

00:31:43.910 --> 00:31:46.950
wondering when the Middle
Ages would ever end,

00:31:46.950 --> 00:31:51.800
the Chinese are inventing the
compass, and toilet paper,

00:31:51.800 --> 00:31:56.210
and wood block printing, and
creating great art and poetry,

00:31:56.210 --> 00:32:00.160
and are ruled by poet-emperors.

00:32:00.160 --> 00:32:02.260
Which is a great hyphenation.

00:32:02.260 --> 00:32:05.860
They were actual poets
who ruled the land.

00:32:05.860 --> 00:32:10.225
We don't have so many
poet politicians today.

00:32:10.225 --> 00:32:11.220
It was a top-down.

00:32:11.220 --> 00:32:12.580
China's always been top-down.

00:32:12.580 --> 00:32:17.250
But the top, then, was not
authoritarian, it was poetic.

00:32:17.250 --> 00:32:20.790
And the Chinese
approach creativity

00:32:20.790 --> 00:32:23.210
from a more com-- the way
they do everything, frankly,

00:32:23.210 --> 00:32:27.060
from a more communal
point of view.

00:32:27.060 --> 00:32:28.900
And if the three
elements for creativity

00:32:28.900 --> 00:32:31.510
are: it has to be new,
surprising, and useful,

00:32:31.510 --> 00:32:34.320
and I believe that's
true, we in the West

00:32:34.320 --> 00:32:38.190
focus on the novelty, and
the surprise/shock effect

00:32:38.190 --> 00:32:40.970
of some invention, creation.

00:32:40.970 --> 00:32:43.790
And the Chinese focus much
more the usefulness of it.

00:32:43.790 --> 00:32:45.040
Is it useful to everyone?

00:32:45.040 --> 00:32:48.090
That's the group part.

00:32:48.090 --> 00:32:52.050
And a lot of the great
Chinese inventors of the day

00:32:52.050 --> 00:32:54.050
remain anonymous.

00:32:54.050 --> 00:32:57.120
We're not so big on
anonymity in the West.

00:32:57.120 --> 00:33:00.330
We need to attach the
genius to a person.

00:33:00.330 --> 00:33:02.290
We have a myth of
the lone genius,

00:33:02.290 --> 00:33:04.250
and it's a very powerful myth.

00:33:04.250 --> 00:33:06.930
It's sometimes useful,
sometimes destructive.

00:33:06.930 --> 00:33:10.740
But if you have a Steve
Wozniak and a Steve Jobs,

00:33:10.740 --> 00:33:13.540
one generally will get
most of the credit.

00:33:13.540 --> 00:33:16.410
We don't get too excited
about group genius,

00:33:16.410 --> 00:33:18.870
because, to us it's
not as romantic.

00:33:18.870 --> 00:33:22.049
But I think it's real
and it's powerful.

00:33:22.049 --> 00:33:23.590
VINT CERF: Some of
you will have been

00:33:23.590 --> 00:33:25.840
here when Walter
Isaacson was talking

00:33:25.840 --> 00:33:28.270
his book "The Innovators."

00:33:28.270 --> 00:33:33.830
He focused strongly on
this pairing of talent.

00:33:33.830 --> 00:33:37.730
Of this creative tension and
this friction, out of which

00:33:37.730 --> 00:33:39.560
came innovation.

00:33:39.560 --> 00:33:43.540
So at least there's one
argument that Walter makes,

00:33:43.540 --> 00:33:46.740
that this myth of
the lone genius,

00:33:46.740 --> 00:33:48.780
in fact, can be refuted.

00:33:48.780 --> 00:33:50.140
Although I think you're right.

00:33:50.140 --> 00:33:53.880
Our society seems to
want to point to somebody

00:33:53.880 --> 00:33:55.950
and say that person did X.

00:33:55.950 --> 00:33:57.200
ERIC WEINER: It can be useful.

00:33:57.200 --> 00:33:58.590
It motivates us.

00:33:58.590 --> 00:33:59.450
VINT CERF: Exactly.

00:33:59.450 --> 00:34:01.066
If he can do it,
then I can do it.

00:34:01.066 --> 00:34:01.940
ERIC WEINER: Exactly.

00:34:01.940 --> 00:34:03.590
VINT CERF: Now, you did
mention something else.

00:34:03.590 --> 00:34:05.140
There's a famous
Chinese expression,

00:34:05.140 --> 00:34:08.820
the first bird to fly is
the one that gets shot.

00:34:08.820 --> 00:34:10.114
Which suggests that there's--

00:34:10.114 --> 00:34:11.739
ERIC WEINER: Doesn't
that make you want

00:34:11.739 --> 00:34:15.230
to go out and do a startup?

00:34:15.230 --> 00:34:19.159
VINT CERF: So that has a way
of suppressing creativity.

00:34:19.159 --> 00:34:25.370
In spite of that, Jack
Ma, who founded Alibaba,

00:34:25.370 --> 00:34:27.380
seems to have done pretty well.

00:34:27.380 --> 00:34:29.760
But in the book,
you say that he was

00:34:29.760 --> 00:34:33.909
worried that Chinese creativity
was squelched by exams.

00:34:33.909 --> 00:34:36.830
That people were forced
to memorize lots of stuff.

00:34:36.830 --> 00:34:39.334
And the consequence of
that was they weren't free.

00:34:39.334 --> 00:34:40.750
They weren't in
that relaxed state

00:34:40.750 --> 00:34:44.560
that you mentioned, to invent.

00:34:44.560 --> 00:34:46.810
Have you taken away
something from the time

00:34:46.810 --> 00:34:48.110
you spent in China?

00:34:48.110 --> 00:34:49.530
Understanding what they are--

00:34:49.530 --> 00:34:51.400
ERIC WEINER: Where it is today?

00:34:51.400 --> 00:34:52.070
Yeah.

00:34:52.070 --> 00:34:54.486
There's a lot of hand-wringing,
obviously, about what they

00:34:54.486 --> 00:34:56.920
call the innovation gap.

00:34:56.920 --> 00:35:00.720
And I'm watching a
program on this, on CCTV.

00:35:00.720 --> 00:35:01.910
It's thankfully in English.

00:35:01.910 --> 00:35:03.450
It's a panel
discussion about, what

00:35:03.450 --> 00:35:05.610
are we going to do about
the innovation gap?

00:35:05.610 --> 00:35:07.610
And I'm not making this
up, one of the panelists

00:35:07.610 --> 00:35:10.850
says, the government
needs to get involved,

00:35:10.850 --> 00:35:13.140
and have a government
innovation program.

00:35:13.140 --> 00:35:17.110
And they need to create an
innovation infrastructure

00:35:17.110 --> 00:35:20.060
the way they created
a high speed rail

00:35:20.060 --> 00:35:26.820
network, and highways, and just
one step away from suggesting

00:35:26.820 --> 00:35:30.440
the government should
regulate spontaneity.

00:35:30.440 --> 00:35:33.325
It was just shy of that,
but everyone on the panel

00:35:33.325 --> 00:35:36.490
is harrumphing in agreement.

00:35:36.490 --> 00:35:38.662
And that is clearly a problem.

00:35:42.224 --> 00:35:44.390
The complaint in China is,
everything is made there,

00:35:44.390 --> 00:35:46.130
but nothing's invented there.

00:35:46.130 --> 00:35:48.600
Now Jack Ma is an
outlier in that sense.

00:35:48.600 --> 00:35:50.360
But the interesting
story about Jack Ma

00:35:50.360 --> 00:35:55.830
is that, I think he's a hybrid
American-Chinese success story.

00:35:55.830 --> 00:35:59.150
He came of age just when China
was opening up to the west,

00:35:59.150 --> 00:36:04.500
and he would hang out at the
Shangri-La Hotel in Hangzhou,

00:36:04.500 --> 00:36:05.700
where he grew up.

00:36:05.700 --> 00:36:08.030
And he didn't speak any English.

00:36:08.030 --> 00:36:10.680
And he would
exchange his services

00:36:10.680 --> 00:36:13.070
as a tour guide for
free English lessons

00:36:13.070 --> 00:36:14.794
from the American
or Western visitors.

00:36:14.794 --> 00:36:16.210
And that's how he
learned English.

00:36:16.210 --> 00:36:16.530
VINT CERF: Clever.

00:36:16.530 --> 00:36:19.461
ERIC WEINER: And I can't help
but think that some of our fish

00:36:19.461 --> 00:36:24.910
tank spilled into his, to use
that analogy, that he picked up

00:36:24.910 --> 00:36:27.620
some of that American
gumption, but still operating

00:36:27.620 --> 00:36:29.220
in a very Chinese system.

00:36:29.220 --> 00:36:32.330
VINT CERF: I'm going to
argue that, in fact, language

00:36:32.330 --> 00:36:35.446
has a great deal to
do with creativity--

00:36:35.446 --> 00:36:36.320
ERIC WEINER: I agree.

00:36:36.320 --> 00:36:37.930
VINT CERF: --and culture.

00:36:37.930 --> 00:36:40.560
And I don't mean that in
a trivial sense at all.

00:36:40.560 --> 00:36:43.960
When I was living in
Germany, I remember

00:36:43.960 --> 00:36:47.050
deciding to read all the
children's stories in German,

00:36:47.050 --> 00:36:50.170
to find out what German
children grow up with.

00:36:50.170 --> 00:36:52.610
And it's very scary stuff.

00:36:52.610 --> 00:36:54.810
You know people's fingers
are being cut off,

00:36:54.810 --> 00:36:56.460
and blood is going everywhere.

00:36:56.460 --> 00:36:58.840
And I thought, my god, if
that's the German childhood,

00:36:58.840 --> 00:37:03.270
this explains something about
the culture of the country.

00:37:03.270 --> 00:37:05.289
I have to share this
with you because I

00:37:05.289 --> 00:37:07.580
thought this was one of the
funniest parts of the book.

00:37:07.580 --> 00:37:09.360
This is on page 101.

00:37:09.360 --> 00:37:11.970
He's meeting with
this guy named Eugene.

00:37:11.970 --> 00:37:13.780
You're in Italy, in Florence.

00:37:13.780 --> 00:37:17.110
And he says, "during our
conversation at the cafe,

00:37:17.110 --> 00:37:20.230
I kept tripping over all
those slippery Italian names.

00:37:20.230 --> 00:37:23.110
So Eugene anglicizes
them for me.

00:37:23.110 --> 00:37:25.460
Michelangelo becomes Mike.

00:37:25.460 --> 00:37:28.445
Leonardo da Vinci becomes Leo.

00:37:28.445 --> 00:37:31.350
Lorenzo Ghiberti becomes Larry.

00:37:31.350 --> 00:37:35.220
And Filippo Brunelleschi
becomes Phil.

00:37:35.220 --> 00:37:39.794
At first this strikes me as
sacrilege, these lofty geniuses

00:37:39.794 --> 00:37:41.960
from the heavens, and brings
them back down to earth

00:37:41.960 --> 00:37:43.610
where they belong.

00:37:43.610 --> 00:37:47.800
This is like
calling Moses, Moe."

00:37:47.800 --> 00:37:50.300
I just was so taken
by that paragraph.

00:37:50.300 --> 00:37:53.165
But this business about
bringing the geniuses down to--

00:37:53.165 --> 00:37:53.310
ERIC WEINER: Yeah.

00:37:53.310 --> 00:37:54.101
VINT CERF: --earth.

00:37:54.101 --> 00:37:55.560
What's that all about?

00:37:55.560 --> 00:37:57.990
ERIC WEINER: We elevate
them on pedestals.

00:37:57.990 --> 00:38:02.280
And we think that they
are different from us.

00:38:02.280 --> 00:38:05.330
I really do believe
that geniuses

00:38:05.330 --> 00:38:06.865
are the secular world's gods.

00:38:10.106 --> 00:38:11.730
Is it OK to talk
about Steve Jobs here?

00:38:11.730 --> 00:38:12.840
That's OK, right?

00:38:12.840 --> 00:38:14.500
VINT CERF: OK.

00:38:14.500 --> 00:38:15.000
Go ahead.

00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:15.300
ERIC WEINER: OK.

00:38:15.300 --> 00:38:15.800
Fine.

00:38:15.800 --> 00:38:19.425
I just didn't know what
the ground rules were.

00:38:19.425 --> 00:38:21.610
You look, especially
because he died,

00:38:21.610 --> 00:38:26.350
so his passing, and the
adulation, and the mourning.

00:38:26.350 --> 00:38:29.150
To me, it took on a
religious character.

00:38:29.150 --> 00:38:34.160
And it dawned on me
that these are our gods.

00:38:34.160 --> 00:38:36.260
And the gods, of course,
are up on Mount Olympus,

00:38:36.260 --> 00:38:41.750
and we can't be like them, and
we can't really reach them.

00:38:41.750 --> 00:38:47.930
And by putting them up on a
pedestal, we reduce ourselves

00:38:47.930 --> 00:38:50.014
and in a way, I think
we actually reduce them.

00:38:50.014 --> 00:38:52.055
VINT CERF: Oh, that's an
interesting [INAUDIBLE].

00:38:52.055 --> 00:38:54.020
ERIC WEINER: And
Eugene was great.

00:38:54.020 --> 00:38:57.480
He's an art historian, with a
dog, who really knew his stuff.

00:38:57.480 --> 00:39:00.660
But he wasn't all caught up
in the academic language.

00:39:00.660 --> 00:39:03.470
He was able to speak
clearly, and plainly,

00:39:03.470 --> 00:39:05.354
about what was the
beauty of the art,

00:39:05.354 --> 00:39:07.020
and where it came
from, which was really

00:39:07.020 --> 00:39:08.790
what I was interested in.

00:39:08.790 --> 00:39:14.440
So I think we need to get the
genius off their pedestal.

00:39:14.440 --> 00:39:20.640
Because it is a continuum, and
we're all on there somewhere.

00:39:20.640 --> 00:39:23.240
VINT CERF: I want you to
have a chance to chat, too.

00:39:23.240 --> 00:39:24.840
And ask questions,
and raise issues,

00:39:24.840 --> 00:39:27.497
but I do want to offer
two other things to draw

00:39:27.497 --> 00:39:29.580
your attention to why this
book is so interesting,

00:39:29.580 --> 00:39:31.840
and that's vocabulary.

00:39:31.840 --> 00:39:34.970
So there are two words that
I had never heard of before.

00:39:34.970 --> 00:39:38.740
One of them is called
flyting, F-L-Y-T-I-N-G.

00:39:38.740 --> 00:39:40.250
ERIC WEINER: Oh, I love that.

00:39:40.250 --> 00:39:42.920
VINT CERF: This, you said,
was ritual humiliation

00:39:42.920 --> 00:39:44.817
by verbal violence.

00:39:44.817 --> 00:39:46.900
ERIC WEINER: Ritual
humiliation of your opponent--

00:39:46.900 --> 00:39:47.060
VINT CERF: Of your opponent.

00:39:47.060 --> 00:39:47.790
ERIC WEINER: --by
verbal violence.

00:39:47.790 --> 00:39:48.290
Yes.

00:39:48.290 --> 00:39:49.110
VINT CERF: OK.

00:39:49.110 --> 00:39:50.220
Where they heck?

00:39:50.220 --> 00:39:52.591
Does that have an
etymology, or something?

00:39:52.591 --> 00:39:53.590
Where does it come from?

00:39:53.590 --> 00:39:57.710
ERIC WEINER: F-L-Y-T-I-N-G.
It's the Scots.

00:39:57.710 --> 00:39:59.370
It's a Scottish, Scots word.

00:39:59.370 --> 00:40:00.380
It's the Scots language.

00:40:00.380 --> 00:40:02.150
Is an old Scots word.

00:40:02.150 --> 00:40:04.900
And I was sitting with a
historian, Scottish historian,

00:40:04.900 --> 00:40:08.055
in Edinburgh named Tom Devine,
and told me about flyting.

00:40:08.055 --> 00:40:10.384
And he got all
excited about this.

00:40:10.384 --> 00:40:11.550
I'm like, what does it mean?

00:40:11.550 --> 00:40:13.810
He's like, oh it's
ritual humiliation

00:40:13.810 --> 00:40:15.840
of your opponent
through verbal violence.

00:40:15.840 --> 00:40:17.610
And he was, like, salivating.

00:40:17.610 --> 00:40:21.040
I'm like, well Tom,
it sounds brutal.

00:40:21.040 --> 00:40:23.550
And he's like, oh it is.

00:40:23.550 --> 00:40:25.840
And we can conclude
a couple things.

00:40:25.840 --> 00:40:28.090
We can conclude that they're
just sadistic, the Scots,

00:40:28.090 --> 00:40:28.900
but they're not.

00:40:28.900 --> 00:40:30.590
Because here is
the key to flyting,

00:40:30.590 --> 00:40:35.100
which is really the idea
of a completely open-ended,

00:40:35.100 --> 00:40:36.380
honest conversation.

00:40:36.380 --> 00:40:38.650
Which doesn't always
happen in this town,

00:40:38.650 --> 00:40:40.120
let's be honest about that.

00:40:40.120 --> 00:40:42.450
But where you just
speak your mind,

00:40:42.450 --> 00:40:45.700
and you're not worried about
offending the other person.

00:40:45.700 --> 00:40:51.240
But the key to a successful
flyting exercise is afterwards,

00:40:51.240 --> 00:40:54.540
you head down to the local
pub for a pint or five,

00:40:54.540 --> 00:40:55.920
and there are no hard feelings.

00:40:55.920 --> 00:40:56.520
VINT CERF: OK.

00:40:56.520 --> 00:40:59.730
ERIC WEINER: And I think
Washington used to be that way,

00:40:59.730 --> 00:41:00.520
is what I'm told.

00:41:00.520 --> 00:41:02.120
VINT CERF: Well the
attorneys are still that way,

00:41:02.120 --> 00:41:03.050
as near as I can tell.

00:41:03.050 --> 00:41:06.500
Now you introduced another
word, which I had trouble with.

00:41:06.500 --> 00:41:08.350
It was shilpit.

00:41:08.350 --> 00:41:10.700
And I misread it a
few times, actually.

00:41:10.700 --> 00:41:16.290
S-H-I-L-P-I-T. What's that?

00:41:16.290 --> 00:41:21.220
ERIC WEINER: It's a Scots
word that means dark, dreary,

00:41:21.220 --> 00:41:22.890
not a very well-dressed person.

00:41:22.890 --> 00:41:24.940
The opposite of you.

00:41:24.940 --> 00:41:25.690
VINT CERF: Oh, OK.

00:41:25.690 --> 00:41:27.148
ERIC WEINER: But
you didn't mention

00:41:27.148 --> 00:41:28.432
my favorite word, sprezzatura.

00:41:28.432 --> 00:41:29.640
VINT CERF: Oh, I missed that.

00:41:29.640 --> 00:41:30.770
What's that all about?

00:41:30.770 --> 00:41:31.747
Is that an Italian--

00:41:31.747 --> 00:41:32.580
ERIC WEINER: Oh yes.

00:41:32.580 --> 00:41:33.620
Yes, yes, yes.

00:41:33.620 --> 00:41:37.560
So the key to Italian
genius is sprezzatura,

00:41:37.560 --> 00:41:40.600
which means literally, a
squirt of something extra.

00:41:40.600 --> 00:41:41.400
VINT CERF: Oh, OK.

00:41:41.400 --> 00:41:43.358
I thought it was a kind
of pasta, or something.

00:41:43.358 --> 00:41:45.800
ERIC WEINER: No
it's not a pasta.

00:41:45.800 --> 00:41:49.030
It's that squirt
of something extra.

00:41:49.030 --> 00:41:53.320
And that's often what
separates a work of genius

00:41:53.320 --> 00:41:55.540
from just something that's good.

00:41:55.540 --> 00:41:59.380
It's that squirt
of something extra.

00:41:59.380 --> 00:42:01.210
And it's not always a
mile, it's sometimes

00:42:01.210 --> 00:42:03.850
just a few inches that squirt.

00:42:03.850 --> 00:42:06.390
But it explains a lot.

00:42:06.390 --> 00:42:10.560
And I think that one of the
keys to creative genius,

00:42:10.560 --> 00:42:12.840
and creative places,
is having people

00:42:12.840 --> 00:42:15.550
who are very good at not
only having sprezzatura,

00:42:15.550 --> 00:42:17.860
but recognizing sprezzatura.

00:42:17.860 --> 00:42:22.950
There's a great
story from Florence.

00:42:22.950 --> 00:42:25.450
The Medici's were in charge.

00:42:25.450 --> 00:42:26.700
They were the de-facto rulers.

00:42:26.700 --> 00:42:31.620
They were wildly wealthy, and
they are great talent scouts.

00:42:31.620 --> 00:42:36.370
So one day Lorenzo Medici, AKA
Lorenzo the Magnificent, as he

00:42:36.370 --> 00:42:37.930
called himself,
and I guess others

00:42:37.930 --> 00:42:40.010
did, because he was in charge.

00:42:40.010 --> 00:42:41.810
He's walking outside
the palace grounds

00:42:41.810 --> 00:42:44.240
and he spots a
young stone cutter

00:42:44.240 --> 00:42:48.240
working on a statue
of Faun, a Roman god.

00:42:48.240 --> 00:42:50.790
And he says, kid you're good.

00:42:50.790 --> 00:42:52.390
You've got talent.

00:42:52.390 --> 00:42:54.520
There's something you're
doing right there.

00:42:54.520 --> 00:42:55.940
Why don't you come live with me?

00:42:55.940 --> 00:43:00.100
Live in my house and I'll
give you the best teachers.

00:43:00.100 --> 00:43:01.790
I will challenge you.

00:43:01.790 --> 00:43:05.910
And I think he recognized
the sprezzatura

00:43:05.910 --> 00:43:08.777
in that 14-year-old kid, who now
is best known as Michelangelo.

00:43:08.777 --> 00:43:09.402
VINT CERF: Wow.

00:43:11.906 --> 00:43:13.530
ERIC WEINER: It's
the recognition part,

00:43:13.530 --> 00:43:15.920
that I think is
hugely important.

00:43:15.920 --> 00:43:18.970
And I think we've
given it short shrift.

00:43:18.970 --> 00:43:23.180
I think we're all code
geniuses, in a way.

00:43:23.180 --> 00:43:27.280
I think Mozart needed
the audience of Vienna.

00:43:27.280 --> 00:43:30.610
They were a demanding audience.

00:43:30.610 --> 00:43:32.490
They were an
appreciative audience.

00:43:32.490 --> 00:43:37.530
And he worked for commissions.

00:43:37.530 --> 00:43:39.417
And I think that that's
hugely important.

00:43:39.417 --> 00:43:41.500
VINT CERF: Well there's
certainly a feedback loop,

00:43:41.500 --> 00:43:41.730
there.

00:43:41.730 --> 00:43:43.270
If you try to do
stand up, if you

00:43:43.270 --> 00:43:46.156
don't get any positive
feedback, it's really tough.

00:43:46.156 --> 00:43:47.280
Well speaking of feedback--

00:43:47.280 --> 00:43:47.900
ERIC WEINER: You
say you're dying.

00:43:47.900 --> 00:43:49.352
I'm dying out here, right?

00:43:49.352 --> 00:43:50.810
VINT CERF: What
kind of feedback do

00:43:50.810 --> 00:43:53.210
we have from our
assembled crowd, here?

00:43:53.210 --> 00:43:54.680
If you have an idea.

00:43:54.680 --> 00:43:56.660
Do we have a microphone
that rolls around?

00:43:56.660 --> 00:43:58.350
Here it comes.

00:43:58.350 --> 00:44:00.246
Flying in the air, we have one.

00:44:00.246 --> 00:44:01.120
ERIC WEINER: Senator.

00:44:01.120 --> 00:44:03.411
VINT CERF: Oh, OK, let's take
Senator Gillibrand first.

00:44:03.411 --> 00:44:05.472
We'll go one, two,
and three, here.

00:44:05.472 --> 00:44:06.930
KIRSTEN GILLIBRAND:
I have a theory

00:44:06.930 --> 00:44:09.240
about closing your
problem with the two

00:44:09.240 --> 00:44:10.744
outcomes in your early studies.

00:44:10.744 --> 00:44:11.410
ERIC WEINER: OK.

00:44:11.410 --> 00:44:15.220
KIRSTEN GILLIBRAND: So you say
inhibition squashes creativity.

00:44:15.220 --> 00:44:16.100
ERIC WEINER: Right.

00:44:16.100 --> 00:44:17.090
KIRSTEN GILLIBRAND:
Fear of failure

00:44:17.090 --> 00:44:18.882
is very present for
someone who is not very

00:44:18.882 --> 00:44:20.006
good at what they're doing.

00:44:20.006 --> 00:44:21.780
So when you tell the
group, just have fun,

00:44:21.780 --> 00:44:22.904
there's no fear of failure.

00:44:22.904 --> 00:44:26.100
If you say only the winner
is going to get $150,

00:44:26.100 --> 00:44:27.990
then you fear that
you're going to lose.

00:44:27.990 --> 00:44:29.620
But when you're
talking about experts,

00:44:29.620 --> 00:44:31.540
people who are very good, they
have less of a fear of failure.

00:44:31.540 --> 00:44:32.956
They've competed
their whole life.

00:44:32.956 --> 00:44:34.640
They can perform on
the highest level.

00:44:34.640 --> 00:44:38.640
So that maybe the reconciliation
between your different studies

00:44:38.640 --> 00:44:39.140
outcomes.

00:44:39.140 --> 00:44:39.520
ERIC WEINER: I like that.

00:44:39.520 --> 00:44:40.145
Can I use that?

00:44:40.145 --> 00:44:41.145
KIRSTEN GILLIBRAND: Yes.

00:44:41.145 --> 00:44:42.310
ERIC WEINER: Thank you.

00:44:42.310 --> 00:44:46.240
And I think it goes to--
most geniuses are prolific.

00:44:46.240 --> 00:44:48.400
They produce more
than others, and they

00:44:48.400 --> 00:44:49.620
produce a lot of bad stuff.

00:44:49.620 --> 00:44:53.300
Picasso has 20,000 works
of art to his name,

00:44:53.300 --> 00:44:56.670
and not all are
masterpieces by a long shot.

00:44:56.670 --> 00:45:00.500
No fear of failure
there at some point.

00:45:00.500 --> 00:45:02.890
AUDIENCE: Briefly, you
touched on language,

00:45:02.890 --> 00:45:04.810
and I was hoping you
could elaborate on

00:45:04.810 --> 00:45:07.130
your point earlier,
that immigrants are more

00:45:07.130 --> 00:45:08.770
likely to be creative geniuses?

00:45:08.770 --> 00:45:10.680
ERIC WEINER: Yeah.

00:45:10.680 --> 00:45:13.590
There's a long list of
immigrants and refugees

00:45:13.590 --> 00:45:15.860
who went on to become
creative geniuses.

00:45:15.860 --> 00:45:18.080
Einstein is the best example.

00:45:18.080 --> 00:45:23.220
Also Freud, Marie
Curie, and others.

00:45:23.220 --> 00:45:25.210
And the question is, why?

00:45:25.210 --> 00:45:29.190
And the traditional explanation
is that they're hungry, right?

00:45:29.190 --> 00:45:32.550
They work, sometimes literally,
they work harder than others.

00:45:32.550 --> 00:45:35.170
They often have a supportive
family in their endeavors.

00:45:35.170 --> 00:45:37.830
And that might explain
their success, but not

00:45:37.830 --> 00:45:39.140
necessarily their creativity.

00:45:39.140 --> 00:45:40.640
So if you bear with
me for a second,

00:45:40.640 --> 00:45:43.890
I think the answer lies in
something called a schema

00:45:43.890 --> 00:45:48.470
violation, S-C-H-E-M-A, and that
is a fancy psychological term

00:45:48.470 --> 00:45:51.210
for when your world
is turned upside down.

00:45:51.210 --> 00:45:56.570
If you eat pancakes for dinner,
or do things in reverse order,

00:45:56.570 --> 00:45:59.150
or wear your underwear
on the outside, whatever,

00:45:59.150 --> 00:46:01.450
you're involved in
a schema violation.

00:46:01.450 --> 00:46:04.900
And in the lab, they have found
that people who either engage

00:46:04.900 --> 00:46:07.860
in these schema violations,
or watch others do it,

00:46:07.860 --> 00:46:08.939
are then more creative.

00:46:08.939 --> 00:46:10.730
And if you think about
the immigrants life,

00:46:10.730 --> 00:46:14.550
what is it but, one
giant schema violation.

00:46:14.550 --> 00:46:17.510
Everything is
off-kilter for them.

00:46:17.510 --> 00:46:19.640
They're off-kilter.

00:46:19.640 --> 00:46:22.230
But I think the key
is, the immigrants have

00:46:22.230 --> 00:46:25.920
to be accepted enough
to be outsiders,

00:46:25.920 --> 00:46:31.140
but inside enough so that
their ideas resonate.

00:46:31.140 --> 00:46:34.260
VINT CERF: So I had a very
interesting discussion

00:46:34.260 --> 00:46:36.670
with some senior
people in Europe.

00:46:36.670 --> 00:46:38.530
We were talking
about creativity.

00:46:38.530 --> 00:46:43.560
And we were wondering
about the risk aversion,

00:46:43.560 --> 00:46:46.640
which is rampant in Europe.

00:46:46.640 --> 00:46:49.360
And in the course
of the conversation

00:46:49.360 --> 00:46:51.380
I was thinking, but
think of all those people

00:46:51.380 --> 00:46:53.550
who immigrated to
the United States,

00:46:53.550 --> 00:46:55.910
and were incredibly
creative, and successful,

00:46:55.910 --> 00:46:57.170
and everything else.

00:46:57.170 --> 00:46:59.170
And then we finally put
two and two together

00:46:59.170 --> 00:47:01.420
and realized that
what happened is,

00:47:01.420 --> 00:47:04.570
all the people with the
genes for risk taking

00:47:04.570 --> 00:47:07.130
moved to the United
States, and the ones

00:47:07.130 --> 00:47:10.260
that didn't have any genes for
risk taking stayed in Europe,

00:47:10.260 --> 00:47:12.960
and then they propagated
in both directions.

00:47:12.960 --> 00:47:14.620
And so that explains
a great deal

00:47:14.620 --> 00:47:16.590
of the difference
in the two cultures.

00:47:16.590 --> 00:47:18.954
We have a question over, where?

00:47:18.954 --> 00:47:19.870
You have a microphone?

00:47:19.870 --> 00:47:20.745
AUDIENCE: Right here.

00:47:20.745 --> 00:47:22.820
So the first seven chapters
you have in the book

00:47:22.820 --> 00:47:25.335
were about places from
the past that had--

00:47:25.335 --> 00:47:26.210
ERIC WEINER: Correct.

00:47:26.210 --> 00:47:27.001
AUDIENCE: --genius.

00:47:27.001 --> 00:47:29.400
And obviously the eighth
chapter is about Silicon Valley,

00:47:29.400 --> 00:47:30.540
which is still ongoing.

00:47:30.540 --> 00:47:33.060
What do you see from your
visits out there, and looking

00:47:33.060 --> 00:47:36.990
at the previous seven examples,
are the threats to having

00:47:36.990 --> 00:47:38.270
it end in Silicon Valley?

00:47:38.270 --> 00:47:39.355
That period of genius.

00:47:39.355 --> 00:47:41.477
Is there something, one,
or two, three, things

00:47:41.477 --> 00:47:43.560
that you see are early
indicators that something's

00:47:43.560 --> 00:47:44.690
going wrong?

00:47:44.690 --> 00:47:46.672
ERIC WEINER: That's
a very good question.

00:47:46.672 --> 00:47:48.130
First of all, the
idea of it ending

00:47:48.130 --> 00:47:51.380
is not out of the question,
because these golden ages

00:47:51.380 --> 00:47:55.330
tend to last a few decades,
maybe half a century, maybe

00:47:55.330 --> 00:47:58.140
a century at the outside.

00:47:58.140 --> 00:48:00.200
Rarely did they
see the end coming.

00:48:00.200 --> 00:48:03.210
I don't think anyone in Detroit
in the '30s, '40s, and '50s,

00:48:03.210 --> 00:48:05.300
saw the end coming.

00:48:05.300 --> 00:48:08.280
I think the biggest threat
can be summed up in one word,

00:48:08.280 --> 00:48:09.940
and that's arrogance.

00:48:09.940 --> 00:48:12.960
I think if you become
arrogant, you lack ignorance.

00:48:12.960 --> 00:48:15.150
You lack that humility.

00:48:15.150 --> 00:48:19.610
Which is, the humility of,
there's things I don't know.

00:48:19.610 --> 00:48:25.520
I think staying in one industry,
and being a one note town,

00:48:25.520 --> 00:48:28.419
albeit one that plays in
different keys, is dangerous.

00:48:28.419 --> 00:48:30.460
All these other places I
looked at, historically,

00:48:30.460 --> 00:48:33.080
were pretty much,
with the exception

00:48:33.080 --> 00:48:39.280
of Vienna in the 1700s with
music, were interdisciplinary.

00:48:39.280 --> 00:48:40.480
There was a lot going on.

00:48:40.480 --> 00:48:44.080
And not only does that
diversify, spread out the risk,

00:48:44.080 --> 00:48:48.690
it also is more likely to have
different fields sparking off

00:48:48.690 --> 00:48:49.700
one another.

00:48:49.700 --> 00:48:51.940
Often a breakthrough
in one field like art,

00:48:51.940 --> 00:48:53.770
might lead to completely
a breakthrough

00:48:53.770 --> 00:49:00.010
in a completely unrelated field
like science, or technology.

00:49:00.010 --> 00:49:03.150
So I'm concerned
about arrogance,

00:49:03.150 --> 00:49:04.710
and I see some
signs of bling out

00:49:04.710 --> 00:49:06.940
there I hadn't seen
10 years ago, always

00:49:06.940 --> 00:49:09.220
the canary in the coal mine.

00:49:09.220 --> 00:49:12.760
And I'm concerned about
the specialization.

00:49:12.760 --> 00:49:14.460
Pixar is probably
the best example

00:49:14.460 --> 00:49:20.230
of combining Hollywood
and Silicon Valley.

00:49:20.230 --> 00:49:22.010
I would say those are
my two big concerns.

00:49:22.010 --> 00:49:24.720
But my theory on Silicon
Valley is that it has nothing

00:49:24.720 --> 00:49:26.590
to do with technology, really.

00:49:26.590 --> 00:49:28.870
The product is
technology, of course,

00:49:28.870 --> 00:49:33.020
but the process is
a creative ecology

00:49:33.020 --> 00:49:36.690
that's very good at
recognizing good ideas.

00:49:36.690 --> 00:49:38.810
Not really inventing
them, the cell phone,

00:49:38.810 --> 00:49:41.430
correct me if I'm wrong, was
not invented in Silicon Valley.

00:49:41.430 --> 00:49:45.050
And I even think venture
capital came from New York.

00:49:45.050 --> 00:49:48.820
But they're good at--
ideas aren't born there,

00:49:48.820 --> 00:49:51.500
they come of age there.

00:49:51.500 --> 00:49:56.070
If they remain good at that,
and good at importing ideas,

00:49:56.070 --> 00:49:58.360
they can stay fresh for
a little while, I think.

00:49:58.360 --> 00:50:00.930
VINT CERF: I would also
argue, Silicon Valley does

00:50:00.930 --> 00:50:03.500
have the advantage of
this constant source,

00:50:03.500 --> 00:50:06.290
an influx of really
well-trained people

00:50:06.290 --> 00:50:07.730
coming out of
Stanford, Berkeley,

00:50:07.730 --> 00:50:08.980
and some of the other schools.

00:50:08.980 --> 00:50:11.250
And this is continuous,
refreshing--

00:50:11.250 --> 00:50:12.340
ERIC WEINER: Fluidity.

00:50:12.340 --> 00:50:13.470
AUDIENCE: Yeah,
that's important.

00:50:13.470 --> 00:50:14.570
VINT CERF: Mike
Nelson over here,

00:50:14.570 --> 00:50:16.110
and then we'll get
some-- who else had it?

00:50:16.110 --> 00:50:16.540
Over there.

00:50:16.540 --> 00:50:17.039
OK.

00:50:17.039 --> 00:50:18.630
So Mike first, then number two.

00:50:18.630 --> 00:50:19.671
MIKE NELSON: Mike Nelson.

00:50:19.671 --> 00:50:24.040
I work for CloudFlare, which
is a Silicon Valley-based web

00:50:24.040 --> 00:50:26.810
company, but I also teach
innovation and internet studies

00:50:26.810 --> 00:50:28.700
at Georgetown.

00:50:28.700 --> 00:50:31.410
On your first page, you talk
about all different types

00:50:31.410 --> 00:50:32.270
of geniuses.

00:50:32.270 --> 00:50:33.030
Fashion geniuses--

00:50:33.030 --> 00:50:33.821
ERIC WEINER: Right.

00:50:33.821 --> 00:50:36.330
MIKE NELSON: --musical
geniuses, artistic geniuses,

00:50:36.330 --> 00:50:38.910
and political geniuses.

00:50:38.910 --> 00:50:41.550
And I was hoping that you'd talk
a little bit about government

00:50:41.550 --> 00:50:42.260
geniuses.

00:50:42.260 --> 00:50:45.630
People who really made
government work better.

00:50:45.630 --> 00:50:48.430
The rest of the book
talks about politics,

00:50:48.430 --> 00:50:49.970
and how the
political environment

00:50:49.970 --> 00:50:52.800
can spur the other
type of genius,

00:50:52.800 --> 00:50:54.370
but I was wondering
if you've thought

00:50:54.370 --> 00:50:56.580
about doing a couple
more chapters,

00:50:56.580 --> 00:51:00.740
and going in search
of places where

00:51:00.740 --> 00:51:03.630
a lot of very smart people got
together and created a better

00:51:03.630 --> 00:51:04.845
form of politics.

00:51:04.845 --> 00:51:06.970
ERIC WEINER: Boy that's--
I should've been prepared

00:51:06.970 --> 00:51:08.770
for that question in
Washington, right?

00:51:08.770 --> 00:51:10.500
Is there-- I'm going
to bounce it back

00:51:10.500 --> 00:51:12.250
to you a little bit,
is there such a thing

00:51:12.250 --> 00:51:13.670
as political genius, really?

00:51:13.670 --> 00:51:14.440
MIKE NELSON: Well I
think Philadelphia--

00:51:14.440 --> 00:51:15.920
ERIC WEINER: Or did it
just leave the room?

00:51:15.920 --> 00:51:16.980
It just left the room.

00:51:16.980 --> 00:51:18.740
MIKE NELSON: Phila--
Yeah, that's right.

00:51:18.740 --> 00:51:21.750
Philadelphia 1776
would be a place

00:51:21.750 --> 00:51:24.930
to go look, and maybe Athens.

00:51:24.930 --> 00:51:28.200
They clearly were developing
new political structures.

00:51:28.200 --> 00:51:30.204
ERIC WEINER: Yeah.

00:51:30.204 --> 00:51:32.120
MIKE NELSON: I think
we're ready for something

00:51:32.120 --> 00:51:34.250
really radical and new.

00:51:34.250 --> 00:51:35.540
If somebody can harness the--

00:51:35.540 --> 00:51:37.120
ERIC WEINER: And you're not
just talking about leadership,

00:51:37.120 --> 00:51:37.880
right?

00:51:37.880 --> 00:51:39.150
MIKE NELSON: No, I'm
talking about structures.

00:51:39.150 --> 00:51:40.050
ERIC WEINER: Winston
Churchill, and that.

00:51:40.050 --> 00:51:41.009
Changing the structure.

00:51:41.009 --> 00:51:41.758
MIKE NELSON: Yeah.

00:51:41.758 --> 00:51:43.430
And as I say, we're
probably at a point

00:51:43.430 --> 00:51:44.850
right now where
that could happen.

00:51:44.850 --> 00:51:47.450
VINT CERF: So if I could
interject an observation.

00:51:47.450 --> 00:51:50.550
Sigmund and I were up at
the state house in Maryland,

00:51:50.550 --> 00:51:51.700
this morning.

00:51:51.700 --> 00:51:54.380
And this state
house was the site

00:51:54.380 --> 00:51:58.130
at which George Washington
resigned his commission

00:51:58.130 --> 00:52:01.050
on December 23rd, 1783.

00:52:01.050 --> 00:52:03.670
And he could have not done that.

00:52:03.670 --> 00:52:06.490
And if you were looking for
an active political genius,

00:52:06.490 --> 00:52:09.970
although he may or may not
have recognized it as such,

00:52:09.970 --> 00:52:11.200
it was transformative.

00:52:11.200 --> 00:52:15.130
Because it was the first time a
successful general essentially

00:52:15.130 --> 00:52:16.870
relinquished all
power, as opposed

00:52:16.870 --> 00:52:19.570
to becoming the King,
or the President,

00:52:19.570 --> 00:52:21.720
or a despot of some kind.

00:52:21.720 --> 00:52:25.564
So if you were looking for a
kernel of example, that's one.

00:52:25.564 --> 00:52:26.980
What about the
other side, though?

00:52:26.980 --> 00:52:29.014
There must be a great
book on political idiocy,

00:52:29.014 --> 00:52:30.180
but that would take a very--

00:52:30.180 --> 00:52:31.155
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:52:32.180 --> 00:52:35.700
ERIC WEINER: I guess the problem
is that, frankly, the word

00:52:35.700 --> 00:52:50.050
politics has been
diminished over the years,

00:52:50.050 --> 00:52:51.330
I think that's fair to say.

00:52:51.330 --> 00:52:53.621
And so you're really talking
about a government genius.

00:52:53.621 --> 00:52:56.340
You're talking about someone
who, essentially, invents

00:52:56.340 --> 00:52:58.700
a new way of organizing
society, that's

00:52:58.700 --> 00:53:02.660
incredibly smart,
useful, surprising,

00:53:02.660 --> 00:53:06.350
leads to flourishing,
and in my mind,

00:53:06.350 --> 00:53:08.920
I've never separated that
out as a separate kind

00:53:08.920 --> 00:53:10.530
of creative act.

00:53:10.530 --> 00:53:11.650
But maybe you're right.

00:53:11.650 --> 00:53:15.090
I have to be honest, I've not
given that a lot of thought.

00:53:15.090 --> 00:53:18.140
Don't devote a lot of
time to it in the book.

00:53:18.140 --> 00:53:20.790
VINT CERF: So Mike
stumps the author.

00:53:20.790 --> 00:53:24.839
MIKE NELSON: We have scared
99.99% of the geniuses out

00:53:24.839 --> 00:53:25.880
of the political process.

00:53:25.880 --> 00:53:27.090
ERIC WEINER: Yeah.

00:53:27.090 --> 00:53:31.840
I would say it's exactly
1776, or it's Athens.

00:53:31.840 --> 00:53:34.410
It's not leadership, per se,
which requires its own skill

00:53:34.410 --> 00:53:37.510
set, but it's inventing
a new form of government.

00:53:37.510 --> 00:53:40.037
It's that break, and
I think it qualifies.

00:53:40.037 --> 00:53:40.620
VINT CERF: OK.

00:53:40.620 --> 00:53:41.870
We have a question over there.

00:53:41.870 --> 00:53:44.090
AUDIENCE: So I had that
last question in mind.

00:53:44.090 --> 00:53:46.320
But let me ask
you the question I

00:53:46.320 --> 00:53:51.300
had related to it, which is,
you list a number of geographies

00:53:51.300 --> 00:53:51.920
in your book.

00:53:51.920 --> 00:53:53.420
But I'm just curious,
what fell out?

00:53:53.420 --> 00:53:55.440
What almost made it,
that you didn't put in?

00:53:55.440 --> 00:53:56.560
ERIC WEINER: OK.

00:53:56.560 --> 00:54:00.039
There were two places.

00:54:00.039 --> 00:54:02.080
First of all, I should
say that my favorite quote

00:54:02.080 --> 00:54:04.580
about writing, is that a piece
of writing is never finished,

00:54:04.580 --> 00:54:06.690
it's only abandoned.

00:54:06.690 --> 00:54:09.350
So everything is incomplete.

00:54:09.350 --> 00:54:12.820
I had hoped to include a chapter
on the Muslim and Arab golden

00:54:12.820 --> 00:54:13.830
ages.

00:54:13.830 --> 00:54:18.760
And the real center for that was
Baghdad, between 800-1000 AD,

00:54:18.760 --> 00:54:21.030
in a place called
the House of Wisdom.

00:54:21.030 --> 00:54:22.570
Or possibly Damascus.

00:54:22.570 --> 00:54:24.670
And I'll be perfectly
honest, even though I'm

00:54:24.670 --> 00:54:27.890
a former foreign correspondent
and war correspondent,

00:54:27.890 --> 00:54:31.050
I did not want my
obituary to read

00:54:31.050 --> 00:54:34.650
"Author dies while
researching a book on genius."

00:54:34.650 --> 00:54:37.114
It's not safe to go
to Baghdad, and that's

00:54:37.114 --> 00:54:38.030
what I do in my books.

00:54:38.030 --> 00:54:40.700
I travel to these places.

00:54:40.700 --> 00:54:43.500
I regret that I was not able to
include that, because it really

00:54:43.500 --> 00:54:44.520
was a golden age.

00:54:44.520 --> 00:54:47.640
It was a little more
diffuse, over time.

00:54:47.640 --> 00:54:49.880
Lasted longer, frankly.

00:54:49.880 --> 00:54:54.940
And the other place that I had
hoped to go to, perhaps I was

00:54:54.940 --> 00:54:59.570
on the fence, it was Paris,
actually at the 1920's.

00:54:59.570 --> 00:55:01.520
But Woody Allen's movie
"Midnight in Paris"

00:55:01.520 --> 00:55:03.103
had just come out,
and I thought, well

00:55:03.103 --> 00:55:04.436
that's a little obvious.

00:55:04.436 --> 00:55:06.060
But true story, I
just got a phone call

00:55:06.060 --> 00:55:09.230
from a French
publisher who said,

00:55:09.230 --> 00:55:12.800
Mr. Weiner, your
book is very nice,

00:55:12.800 --> 00:55:16.380
but why no chapter on France?

00:55:16.380 --> 00:55:17.260
AUDIENCE: [LAUGHTER]

00:55:17.260 --> 00:55:19.860
ERIC WEINER: We have
the geniuses here.

00:55:19.860 --> 00:55:22.640
And so they may
fly me out to Paris

00:55:22.640 --> 00:55:27.240
to write a chapter for the
French edition, about Paris.

00:55:27.240 --> 00:55:29.840
Which I just may
take them up on.

00:55:29.840 --> 00:55:31.360
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:55:31.360 --> 00:55:33.980
ERIC WEINER: Yeah, two
places I would have.

00:55:33.980 --> 00:55:35.520
But maybe in the paperback?

00:55:35.520 --> 00:55:36.860
Or the expanded version?

00:55:36.860 --> 00:55:38.780
Or the Hollywood film?

00:55:38.780 --> 00:55:40.890
Who knows.

00:55:40.890 --> 00:55:41.559
VINT CERF: OK.

00:55:41.559 --> 00:55:42.100
There we are.

00:55:42.100 --> 00:55:42.600
David. you

00:55:42.600 --> 00:55:44.474
DAVID: Eric, thank you
for writing this book.

00:55:44.474 --> 00:55:46.280
I've only gotten
through Athens so far,

00:55:46.280 --> 00:55:47.310
but looking forward to--

00:55:47.310 --> 00:55:48.518
ERIC WEINER: Congratulations.

00:55:48.518 --> 00:55:49.986
DAVID: --the rest
of it, thank you.

00:55:49.986 --> 00:55:56.250
You talk about genius
and creativity in a hole.

00:55:56.250 --> 00:55:58.389
I think some of the
examples you use though,

00:55:58.389 --> 00:55:59.680
are different from one another.

00:55:59.680 --> 00:56:02.590
You talk about
the genius of art.

00:56:02.590 --> 00:56:04.890
And the genius of discovery.

00:56:04.890 --> 00:56:08.290
And the genius of creation.

00:56:08.290 --> 00:56:10.880
I'm wondering how different
they are from one another.

00:56:10.880 --> 00:56:14.140
So for instance, if David
had not been carved,

00:56:14.140 --> 00:56:16.350
there might not ever
have been a David.

00:56:16.350 --> 00:56:17.910
But the light bulb
certainly would

00:56:17.910 --> 00:56:21.270
have been invented, or
discovered, at some point.

00:56:21.270 --> 00:56:24.030
And some of the things that are
built, would have been built

00:56:24.030 --> 00:56:25.780
anyway, would have
been discovered anyway,

00:56:25.780 --> 00:56:28.020
would have been figured
out anyway, over time.

00:56:28.020 --> 00:56:30.566
ERIC WEINER: Are you sure?

00:56:30.566 --> 00:56:31.440
DAVID: I'm confident.

00:56:31.440 --> 00:56:33.430
I'm not sure, but I'm confident.

00:56:33.430 --> 00:56:35.630
But you look at, for
instance, the music

00:56:35.630 --> 00:56:37.070
of Stevie Wonder, right?

00:56:37.070 --> 00:56:40.370
And nobody might have
ever, til the end of time,

00:56:40.370 --> 00:56:42.080
been another Stevie Wonder.

00:56:42.080 --> 00:56:44.509
But the internet,
Vint, I think you're

00:56:44.509 --> 00:56:46.050
a wonderful, wonderful,
person, but I

00:56:46.050 --> 00:56:48.080
think at some point the internet
would have been discovered,

00:56:48.080 --> 00:56:49.340
or invented, or created.

00:56:49.340 --> 00:56:51.090
VINT CERF: It certainly
wasn't discovered.

00:56:51.090 --> 00:56:51.977
It's an invention.

00:56:51.977 --> 00:56:53.060
That's an important thing.

00:56:53.060 --> 00:56:56.170
We didn't pick up a cabbage,
and find the internet.

00:56:58.990 --> 00:57:01.240
DAVID: In fact maybe my
question ought to be for Vint.

00:57:01.240 --> 00:57:02.951
Would the internet
have been built?

00:57:02.951 --> 00:57:04.950
VINT CERF: Well there
would have been something.

00:57:04.950 --> 00:57:05.824
And I agree with you.

00:57:05.824 --> 00:57:10.490
We had a little discussion
before this, this afternoon.

00:57:10.490 --> 00:57:13.350
A lot of things happened because
it's now possible for them

00:57:13.350 --> 00:57:14.240
to happen.

00:57:14.240 --> 00:57:17.080
There was a lot going
on in networking.

00:57:17.080 --> 00:57:19.790
Internet happened to
have been the design that

00:57:19.790 --> 00:57:21.280
was most successful.

00:57:21.280 --> 00:57:23.590
But there were several other
networking technologies

00:57:23.590 --> 00:57:24.500
at the time.

00:57:24.500 --> 00:57:28.320
There were some
proprietary, some like X.25

00:57:28.320 --> 00:57:30.720
was a global thing.

00:57:30.720 --> 00:57:33.160
The OSI structure, it
was another proposal.

00:57:33.160 --> 00:57:35.860
So yes, I agree with you that
something would have happened,

00:57:35.860 --> 00:57:37.030
because it was possible.

00:57:37.030 --> 00:57:39.260
And many people were
thinking about it,

00:57:39.260 --> 00:57:41.070
and trying experiments.

00:57:41.070 --> 00:57:42.430
So I agree with that.

00:57:42.430 --> 00:57:45.610
But I'm glad that the one
that I worked on came out OK.

00:57:45.610 --> 00:57:46.400
DAVID: Me too.

00:57:46.400 --> 00:57:47.580
Thank you.

00:57:47.580 --> 00:57:50.460
ERIC WEINER: I guess I don't
see them as that different.

00:57:50.460 --> 00:57:53.460
I think creativity
is creativity,

00:57:53.460 --> 00:57:56.100
but there are some
differences, you're right.

00:57:56.100 --> 00:57:57.900
An art historian
in Florence told me

00:57:57.900 --> 00:57:59.830
that, what made the
David the David,

00:57:59.830 --> 00:58:03.140
is that once it was created,
people knew it was the best,

00:58:03.140 --> 00:58:05.730
and knew there would
not be an upgrade.

00:58:05.730 --> 00:58:08.820
A David 2.0, right?

00:58:08.820 --> 00:58:11.940
A piece of art like that,
renders any idea of improvement

00:58:11.940 --> 00:58:13.450
silly, really.

00:58:13.450 --> 00:58:15.000
And of course,
science and technology

00:58:15.000 --> 00:58:17.270
is always being improved upon.

00:58:17.270 --> 00:58:20.440
I mean, Steve Jobs,
shortly before his death,

00:58:20.440 --> 00:58:24.590
was asked about the connection
between Renaissance Florence

00:58:24.590 --> 00:58:25.396
and Silicon Valley.

00:58:25.396 --> 00:58:27.020
And he, I think,
rightfully pointed out

00:58:27.020 --> 00:58:30.240
one of the differences is that
the artists of Renaissance

00:58:30.240 --> 00:58:32.780
Florence were creating
something for all time,

00:58:32.780 --> 00:58:35.220
to last forever,
through the ages.

00:58:35.220 --> 00:58:37.787
And in Silicon Valley
they're creating something--

00:58:37.787 --> 00:58:39.870
VINT CERF: That lasts six
months, if you're lucky.

00:58:39.870 --> 00:58:41.960
ERIC WEINER: Thank you
for completing the line.

00:58:41.960 --> 00:58:43.060
You're right.

00:58:43.060 --> 00:58:46.150
And that is the difference.

00:58:46.150 --> 00:58:48.400
There are differences,
but I just

00:58:48.400 --> 00:58:50.630
have a feeling that the
creative scientist, and that

00:58:50.630 --> 00:58:54.150
is not an oxymoron, has more in
common with a creative artist

00:58:54.150 --> 00:58:57.200
than they think.

00:58:57.200 --> 00:59:01.180
But I try to put them
under an umbrella,

00:59:01.180 --> 00:59:03.950
because we consider them genius.

00:59:03.950 --> 00:59:07.360
We consider Mozart a genius, and
we consider Einstein a genius.

00:59:07.360 --> 00:59:09.080
And we don't modify either one.

00:59:09.080 --> 00:59:12.020
We don't say that Einstein
was a scientific genius.

00:59:12.020 --> 00:59:13.790
And that Mozart was
a musical genius.

00:59:13.790 --> 00:59:16.190
We tend to just use
the word genius, so

00:59:16.190 --> 00:59:19.800
that they transcend
their excellence,

00:59:19.800 --> 00:59:26.290
and their je ne sais quoi,
got the French thing going,

00:59:26.290 --> 00:59:28.590
elevates them above
their particular field.

00:59:28.590 --> 00:59:31.900
And I do think that happens,
but it's a good point though.

00:59:31.900 --> 00:59:33.830
VINT CERF: OK, we have
a question back there.

00:59:33.830 --> 00:59:37.820
Do you have thoughts about
whether the physical attributes

00:59:37.820 --> 00:59:39.660
of the place make a difference?

00:59:39.660 --> 00:59:41.450
ERIC WEINER: Yeah,
that's a good question.

00:59:41.450 --> 00:59:43.330
When I first got to
Athens, and you're

00:59:43.330 --> 00:59:47.040
struck by the sunshine in
Athens, 300 days a year

00:59:47.040 --> 00:59:47.550
of sunshine.

00:59:47.550 --> 00:59:51.650
And the light, which is very
striking, very severe, and it

00:59:51.650 --> 00:59:54.170
was a Greek painter,
Apollodorus,

00:59:54.170 --> 00:59:57.170
who first developed the
ability to use shadow to create

00:59:57.170 --> 00:59:58.480
the impression of depth.

00:59:58.480 --> 01:00:00.500
And that makes sense.

01:00:00.500 --> 01:00:02.740
And I thought, well,
is it the weather?

01:00:02.740 --> 01:00:04.300
Maybe that would be easy.

01:00:04.300 --> 01:00:07.500
But then you think about
Elizabeth London, no.

01:00:07.500 --> 01:00:10.240
That was not so sunny.

01:00:10.240 --> 01:00:14.120
I think the main thing
is, of the attributes,

01:00:14.120 --> 01:00:16.670
is that they
provide a challenge.

01:00:16.670 --> 01:00:18.820
There are difficult places.

01:00:18.820 --> 01:00:20.450
Have you heard of the oil curse?

01:00:20.450 --> 01:00:21.830
And it goes by different names.

01:00:21.830 --> 01:00:25.690
It's basically the idea that
certain Persian Gulf nations

01:00:25.690 --> 01:00:28.030
are not particularly
innovative, because they just

01:00:28.030 --> 01:00:29.330
don't have to do be.

01:00:29.330 --> 01:00:33.060
That they're so awash in
oil, and even with oil prices

01:00:33.060 --> 01:00:35.520
where they are now,
and with natural gas,

01:00:35.520 --> 01:00:38.484
that they don't have
anything to push against.

01:00:38.484 --> 01:00:39.650
They don't have a challenge.

01:00:39.650 --> 01:00:41.270
So the one thing
that I think actually

01:00:41.270 --> 01:00:44.660
is important, is
to be challenged.

01:00:44.660 --> 01:00:46.450
Now in Athens, the
challenge was the land

01:00:46.450 --> 01:00:49.020
was crummy, and
didn't grow much.

01:00:49.020 --> 01:00:52.872
Florence was malarial,
and didn't have a seaport.

01:00:52.872 --> 01:00:54.340
Ah, Silicon Valley.

01:00:54.340 --> 01:00:55.840
What's the challenge?

01:00:55.840 --> 01:00:57.900
Too much Beauty No.

01:00:57.900 --> 01:01:00.240
I think it was the
isolation, separation,

01:01:00.240 --> 01:01:02.550
from the rest of the country.

01:01:02.550 --> 01:01:06.360
That really mattered
back in the early 1900s.

01:01:06.360 --> 01:01:09.054
They were able to
have a fresh start.

01:01:09.054 --> 01:01:10.470
They had a chip
on their shoulder.

01:01:10.470 --> 01:01:12.570
Not the microchip,
but the other kind.

01:01:12.570 --> 01:01:17.380
They wanted they wanted to
prove themselves, really.

01:01:17.380 --> 01:01:21.010
In an indirect way, yes, I think
the land itself plays a role.

01:01:21.010 --> 01:01:24.290
VINT CERF: Something interesting
about Silicon Valley.

01:01:24.290 --> 01:01:27.170
In the book you talk
about Fred Terman,

01:01:27.170 --> 01:01:28.890
and his father, Lewis Terman.

01:01:28.890 --> 01:01:31.600
Fred was provost of
Stanford University.

01:01:31.600 --> 01:01:33.770
But he was the
guy who recognized

01:01:33.770 --> 01:01:37.070
that the advances that were made
during the Second World War,

01:01:37.070 --> 01:01:40.740
were a consequence of government
investment in the Manhattan

01:01:40.740 --> 01:01:44.580
Project, in computers, and
things like that, radar.

01:01:44.580 --> 01:01:48.740
And he realized that there was
an opportunity for Stanford

01:01:48.740 --> 01:01:53.180
to continue that level of
creativity, and invention,

01:01:53.180 --> 01:01:56.640
and discovery, if they could get
continued government support.

01:01:56.640 --> 01:01:59.350
So he made the argument that
the government should continue

01:01:59.350 --> 01:02:01.510
to fund this kind
of research, and it

01:02:01.510 --> 01:02:06.370
enabled him to expand the
engineering and research

01:02:06.370 --> 01:02:08.410
department by a factor of three.

01:02:08.410 --> 01:02:09.920
Because basically,
instead of having

01:02:09.920 --> 01:02:14.220
to pay for the cost of the
professors out of tuition,

01:02:14.220 --> 01:02:17.114
he paid for 2/3 of their
cost out of research funds,

01:02:17.114 --> 01:02:19.780
which meant that they could have
three times as many professors,

01:02:19.780 --> 01:02:22.810
and still have one
third teaching load.

01:02:22.810 --> 01:02:26.930
And so part of the
Silicon Valley phenomenon,

01:02:26.930 --> 01:02:30.570
comes out of that
recognition and action.

01:02:30.570 --> 01:02:33.580
And after that,
he was the one who

01:02:33.580 --> 01:02:35.650
counseled Hewlett
and Packard, as you

01:02:35.650 --> 01:02:38.530
wrote, to go start a
company, as opposed

01:02:38.530 --> 01:02:40.680
to going to work somewhere.

01:02:40.680 --> 01:02:46.400
And this idea of starting
companies starts with HP.

01:02:46.400 --> 01:02:48.550
And it continues to this day.

01:02:48.550 --> 01:02:50.790
And that whole
feedback loop, you

01:02:50.790 --> 01:02:53.210
mention in the book
about feedback loops,

01:02:53.210 --> 01:02:55.240
and how reinforcing they can be.

01:02:55.240 --> 01:02:58.150
I think Silicon Valley
discovered that feedback loop

01:02:58.150 --> 01:03:02.900
very early in the
game, in the 1950s.

01:03:02.900 --> 01:03:06.520
So let me get Mike, and then
we have one more over there.

01:03:06.520 --> 01:03:08.900
Oh, OK, so let's
take this one first.

01:03:08.900 --> 01:03:10.050
AUDIENCE: Hi.

01:03:10.050 --> 01:03:11.110
Thank you for this topic.

01:03:11.110 --> 01:03:12.693
I think it's really
fascinating, and I

01:03:12.693 --> 01:03:15.200
was hoping you could talk a
little bit about what happened,

01:03:15.200 --> 01:03:17.180
or what you thought
about the societies,

01:03:17.180 --> 01:03:18.770
once the golden age ended.

01:03:18.770 --> 01:03:20.360
Was there anything in common?

01:03:20.360 --> 01:03:22.910
Do you think of anything
that's happened--

01:03:22.910 --> 01:03:24.880
these all happened in
different parts of time

01:03:24.880 --> 01:03:27.650
but taken together,
was there anything

01:03:27.650 --> 01:03:30.990
that China has in common
with Edinburgh, for example?

01:03:30.990 --> 01:03:33.010
ERIC WEINER: Do you mean
about why they ended?

01:03:33.010 --> 01:03:34.426
Or about what
happened afterwards?

01:03:34.426 --> 01:03:36.740
AUDIENCE: What happened to
the society, really, after?

01:03:36.740 --> 01:03:39.330
Did some of them
revert to a dark age?

01:03:39.330 --> 01:03:44.660
Do you still see some of
these factors for genius

01:03:44.660 --> 01:03:45.880
that could come back?

01:03:45.880 --> 01:03:47.630
ERIC WEINER: Yeah,
that's a good question.

01:03:47.630 --> 01:03:51.040
Obviously nothing
particularly good happens.

01:03:51.040 --> 01:03:55.770
But it's very interesting that
the Greeks, the Athenians, you

01:03:55.770 --> 01:03:58.130
can mark their
decline almost exactly

01:03:58.130 --> 01:04:00.577
with when they became foodies.

01:04:00.577 --> 01:04:02.410
Because, when they were
in their golden age,

01:04:02.410 --> 01:04:03.970
they were not into food at all.

01:04:03.970 --> 01:04:07.650
They had a very bland diet.

01:04:07.650 --> 01:04:10.060
Aristophanes, the
playwright and poet,

01:04:10.060 --> 01:04:14.170
attributed the keen Athenian
mind to their low calorie diet.

01:04:14.170 --> 01:04:17.550
And then they started
to eat gourmet food,

01:04:17.550 --> 01:04:21.560
and shop at the equivalent of
Williams and Sonoma, back then.

01:04:21.560 --> 01:04:23.430
No really, that
kind of decadence

01:04:23.430 --> 01:04:27.190
is, and getting back to someones
question about Silicon Valley,

01:04:27.190 --> 01:04:28.560
you see signs of that there.

01:04:28.560 --> 01:04:31.770
They tend to be one way
streets, for the most part.

01:04:31.770 --> 01:04:32.820
With a few exceptions.

01:04:32.820 --> 01:04:35.350
Being that once the
golden age happens,

01:04:35.350 --> 01:04:38.500
it takes a long, long time
for anything to come back.

01:04:38.500 --> 01:04:40.110
Vienna was a bit
of an exception,

01:04:40.110 --> 01:04:44.440
because you had
music in 1788, 1800,

01:04:44.440 --> 01:04:46.610
ending probably with Beethoven.

01:04:46.610 --> 01:04:48.730
And then 75, 100
years later, you

01:04:48.730 --> 01:04:51.860
had this huge explosion
with Freud and Gustav Klimt.

01:04:51.860 --> 01:04:53.430
So that was an exception.

01:04:53.430 --> 01:04:57.760
I think China can be an
exception to this one way rule,

01:04:57.760 --> 01:04:59.920
because the Chinese
view everything

01:04:59.920 --> 01:05:01.000
in a more cyclical way.

01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:03.540
They certainly view time
in a more cyclical way.

01:05:03.540 --> 01:05:05.350
We tend to view it as one way.

01:05:05.350 --> 01:05:09.070
That you get one
shot at everything.

01:05:09.070 --> 01:05:11.060
And I do address in
the book, this notion

01:05:11.060 --> 01:05:14.180
of what I call the golden
age hangover, which

01:05:14.180 --> 01:05:16.590
is, no seriously, in these
places that were great,

01:05:16.590 --> 01:05:18.260
and then where tourists
flock to today,

01:05:18.260 --> 01:05:22.810
to immerse themselves in,
and wallow in the greatness.

01:05:22.810 --> 01:05:24.120
Those are problems.

01:05:24.120 --> 01:05:25.880
You don't want to
be a young artist

01:05:25.880 --> 01:05:27.760
today, in Florence, Italy.

01:05:27.760 --> 01:05:29.520
I met with some of
them in a dinner party,

01:05:29.520 --> 01:05:33.740
and the weight of
the past, they're

01:05:33.740 --> 01:05:36.870
visibly slumping in their
seat, their shoulders

01:05:36.870 --> 01:05:40.120
are slumping, because good
luck trying to do anything.

01:05:40.120 --> 01:05:42.280
And I meet with a Greek
philosopher today,

01:05:42.280 --> 01:05:45.760
and he's like, it's tough.

01:05:45.760 --> 01:05:47.580
I'm like, so what's
it like being

01:05:47.580 --> 01:05:50.050
a Greek philosopher in 2015?

01:05:50.050 --> 01:05:51.925
And he said hungry.

01:05:51.925 --> 01:05:52.425
Very hungry.

01:05:56.380 --> 01:05:58.840
But less true for
Scotland, and some

01:05:58.840 --> 01:06:00.540
of the other places
that-- ironically,

01:06:00.540 --> 01:06:03.340
the places that are lesser
known on the world stage,

01:06:03.340 --> 01:06:06.190
and get fewer
tourists, they still

01:06:06.190 --> 01:06:09.250
have a bit more
creativity going on.

01:06:09.250 --> 01:06:10.580
VINT CERF: So here we go, Mike.

01:06:10.580 --> 01:06:13.610
Is there someone else
with a microphone, also?

01:06:13.610 --> 01:06:16.750
MIKE NELSON: As I mentioned
before, I teach at Georgetown,

01:06:16.750 --> 01:06:20.490
so I pay a lot of attention
to the bibliography in a book,

01:06:20.490 --> 01:06:22.936
because I'm always trying
to pull together a syllabus.

01:06:22.936 --> 01:06:24.310
So I wanted to
know whether there

01:06:24.310 --> 01:06:26.050
were any books in
your bibliography

01:06:26.050 --> 01:06:28.790
that really shaped how you
approach this question.

01:06:28.790 --> 01:06:32.150
I noticed that you referenced
Richard Florida's work

01:06:32.150 --> 01:06:35.130
on creative clusters.

01:06:35.130 --> 01:06:37.050
There's a great
book by Daniel Pink,

01:06:37.050 --> 01:06:40.970
called "Drive," that talks about
how to motivate innovation.

01:06:40.970 --> 01:06:46.020
But two favorite books
are by Tom Standage, who's

01:06:46.020 --> 01:06:49.920
written "The History of
the World in 6 Glasses,"

01:06:49.920 --> 01:06:52.630
and he talked about
the power of coffee

01:06:52.630 --> 01:06:55.009
for spurring innovation
and collaboration.

01:06:55.009 --> 01:06:57.050
ERIC WEINER: Yeah, I'm
not entirely sold on that.

01:06:57.050 --> 01:06:58.780
I think the coffee
house, and the--

01:06:58.780 --> 01:06:59.230
MIKE NELSON: Exactly.

01:06:59.230 --> 01:06:59.750
ERIC WEINER: --cafe, yes.

01:06:59.750 --> 01:07:00.620
But--

01:07:00.620 --> 01:07:01.340
MIKE NELSON: The coffee house.

01:07:01.340 --> 01:07:03.173
ERIC WEINER: --not
necessarily the caffeine.

01:07:03.173 --> 01:07:05.950
Caffeine actually will make
you a little bit less creative.

01:07:05.950 --> 01:07:06.660
It doesn't seem--

01:07:06.660 --> 01:07:07.790
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

01:07:09.249 --> 01:07:10.790
MIKE NELSON: But he
also talks about,

01:07:10.790 --> 01:07:12.623
he's got a book called
"Writing on the Wall"

01:07:12.623 --> 01:07:14.397
the first 2,000 years
of social media.

01:07:14.397 --> 01:07:16.230
ERIC WEINER: The books
that I like the most,

01:07:16.230 --> 01:07:17.710
are probably the
more boring ones.

01:07:17.710 --> 01:07:21.282
I make it a habit to read boring
books, and translating them.

01:07:21.282 --> 01:07:21.865
No, seriously.

01:07:26.732 --> 01:07:28.440
Sir Peter Hall, who
passed away recently,

01:07:28.440 --> 01:07:33.040
wrote the book that my
publisher feared I would write,

01:07:33.040 --> 01:07:34.540
called Cities and Civilization.

01:07:34.540 --> 01:07:37.380
1,057 pages long.

01:07:37.380 --> 01:07:41.310
And he really did go
to all these places.

01:07:41.310 --> 01:07:45.080
And certainly that
was very helpful.

01:07:45.080 --> 01:07:51.080
I read a lot of Lewis Mumford,
and his classics on the city.

01:07:51.080 --> 01:07:56.020
I tended to read the older
stuff, and bring it to light.

01:07:56.020 --> 01:07:58.640
And I would find some gems.

01:07:58.640 --> 01:08:00.800
I was a fellow at
Georgetown at the time,

01:08:00.800 --> 01:08:03.530
and you have a halfway
decent library there,

01:08:03.530 --> 01:08:12.510
and I found a book called
"The Anatomy of Inspiration."

01:08:12.510 --> 01:08:13.377
Really obscure book.

01:08:13.377 --> 01:08:15.460
And this is one of the
joys of researching a book,

01:08:15.460 --> 01:08:19.300
is finding these obscure
books, these geniuses, right,

01:08:19.300 --> 01:08:21.720
and borrowing their ideas.

01:08:21.720 --> 01:08:23.670
But crediting them.

01:08:23.670 --> 01:08:26.550
And that had so
much on the habits

01:08:26.550 --> 01:08:30.200
of these particular geniuses.

01:08:30.200 --> 01:08:32.609
VINT CERF: We should
probably wrap up in a bit,

01:08:32.609 --> 01:08:35.090
and you'll have an opportunity
for some refreshments,

01:08:35.090 --> 01:08:38.937
and a chance to get your book
signed, if Eric is so inclined.

01:08:38.937 --> 01:08:40.020
ERIC WEINER: I'm inclined.

01:08:40.020 --> 01:08:43.069
VINT CERF: I was going to ask
a slightly different question,

01:08:43.069 --> 01:08:48.210
maybe to a question,
and then a wrap up.

01:08:48.210 --> 01:08:51.370
When you talk about golden
ages, I was thinking,

01:08:51.370 --> 01:08:53.479
let's ignore cities
for just a moment,

01:08:53.479 --> 01:08:57.069
although in history, sometimes
the city and the culture

01:08:57.069 --> 01:08:59.020
were coterminous.

01:08:59.020 --> 01:09:01.850
Athens and Sparta, and so on.

01:09:01.850 --> 01:09:05.370
But let's imagine just
civilizations now, and forget

01:09:05.370 --> 01:09:07.510
about specific cities.

01:09:07.510 --> 01:09:12.630
Do you suppose, just based on
what you've already researched,

01:09:12.630 --> 01:09:16.180
are there similarities
between the cultures of each

01:09:16.180 --> 01:09:17.330
of those golden ages?

01:09:17.330 --> 01:09:19.390
So There's a golden
age in Persia,

01:09:19.390 --> 01:09:24.430
there's a golden age in China,
there's a golden age in Japan,

01:09:24.430 --> 01:09:30.790
is there anything about them
that you could correlate?

01:09:30.790 --> 01:09:33.109
Is there something
we can distill

01:09:33.109 --> 01:09:35.750
from looking at these
various golden ages

01:09:35.750 --> 01:09:38.760
that will tell us something
about how they start,

01:09:38.760 --> 01:09:41.450
and why they end?

01:09:41.450 --> 01:09:44.970
ERIC WEINER: You saved
the big question for last.

01:09:44.970 --> 01:09:47.424
VINT CERF: You're welcome.

01:09:47.424 --> 01:09:48.810
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

01:09:48.810 --> 01:09:51.143
ERIC WEINER: I think if you
read the book, first of all,

01:09:51.143 --> 01:09:53.351
you'll be surprised
at how much fun it is.

01:09:53.351 --> 01:09:54.350
Because it is a journey.

01:09:57.390 --> 01:10:00.020
And the question, though,
that I wrestled with,

01:10:00.020 --> 01:10:03.740
is, I know people like to have
everything tied up in a bow.

01:10:03.740 --> 01:10:06.750
And they like to know
what the formula is.

01:10:06.750 --> 01:10:09.120
And I wrestle with
that, because the book

01:10:09.120 --> 01:10:11.670
is very much an intellectual
journey, and an exploration.

01:10:11.670 --> 01:10:14.150
Trying to really, in a
really open minded way,

01:10:14.150 --> 01:10:16.640
figure out what the
heck was going on there,

01:10:16.640 --> 01:10:18.880
and what can we learn from it?

01:10:18.880 --> 01:10:23.840
And in the epilogue, I do
come up with a small bow.

01:10:23.840 --> 01:10:26.860
What I call the three
D's, which I think

01:10:26.860 --> 01:10:29.850
are essential to
all of these places.

01:10:29.850 --> 01:10:32.680
And I thought of a fourth
D since the book came out,

01:10:32.680 --> 01:10:37.050
but that's OK, it's in there
anyway, in other forms.

01:10:37.050 --> 01:10:40.727
And that is diversity,
discernment, and disorder.

01:10:40.727 --> 01:10:41.810
We've talked a bit about--

01:10:41.810 --> 01:10:42.685
VINT CERF: Diversity?

01:10:42.685 --> 01:10:45.540
ERIC WEINER: Diversity,
discernment, and disorder.

01:10:45.540 --> 01:10:47.314
VINT CERF: Discernment
and disorder.

01:10:47.314 --> 01:10:48.855
ERIC WEINER: Add a
little discomfort.

01:10:51.592 --> 01:10:52.550
Let's make it four D's.

01:10:52.550 --> 01:10:53.345
What the heck?

01:10:53.345 --> 01:10:54.900
VINT CERF: What's
the fourth one?

01:10:54.900 --> 01:10:55.690
ERIC WEINER: Discomfort.

01:10:55.690 --> 01:10:56.460
VINT CERF: Oh, discomfort.

01:10:56.460 --> 01:10:57.060
Oh good.

01:10:57.060 --> 01:10:57.671
Yes.

01:10:57.671 --> 01:10:58.170
Yay.

01:10:58.170 --> 01:10:59.378
ERIC WEINER: Yay, discomfort.

01:10:59.378 --> 01:11:02.059
And so they all
have this in common,

01:11:02.059 --> 01:11:03.850
but then they all have
their unique flavors

01:11:03.850 --> 01:11:05.470
and other things going on.

01:11:05.470 --> 01:11:08.500
Diversity, I'm not
really speaking

01:11:08.500 --> 01:11:10.930
about ethnic diversity,
though that does help.

01:11:10.930 --> 01:11:13.670
I'm speaking about
intellectual diversity.

01:11:13.670 --> 01:11:15.440
But typically people
from other places

01:11:15.440 --> 01:11:17.750
tend to bring other
ideas, which is helpful.

01:11:17.750 --> 01:11:21.730
A free flow of ideas.

01:11:21.730 --> 01:11:23.050
That kind of diversity.

01:11:23.050 --> 01:11:25.910
And really, it doesn't
begin with the letter D

01:11:25.910 --> 01:11:28.470
because it's a letter O, but
it's important, too openness.

01:11:28.470 --> 01:11:30.090
Openness to experience.

01:11:30.090 --> 01:11:32.460
That's the one trait
that psychologists

01:11:32.460 --> 01:11:34.760
say is the most important
for creative people,

01:11:34.760 --> 01:11:36.610
and I would say creative places.

01:11:36.610 --> 01:11:38.590
It's pretty broad, I
know, but it's important.

01:11:38.590 --> 01:11:40.540
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

01:11:40.540 --> 01:11:42.600
Number two is
discernment, because it's

01:11:42.600 --> 01:11:44.760
like the flip side
of the openness.

01:11:44.760 --> 01:11:46.550
You can't just have tolerance.

01:11:46.550 --> 01:11:49.824
Las Vegas is a pretty darn
tolerant place, but not

01:11:49.824 --> 01:11:52.365
a lot of genius coming out of
there, except for Andre Agassi.

01:11:56.920 --> 01:12:01.880
Jonas Salk, two-time
Nobel prize winner,

01:12:01.880 --> 01:12:04.950
once asked by a young
student, Dr. Salk,

01:12:04.950 --> 01:12:07.050
how do you come up with
so many good ideas?

01:12:07.050 --> 01:12:08.780
He said, well it's easy.

01:12:08.780 --> 01:12:12.670
I come up with lots of ideas,
and I throw out the bad ones.

01:12:12.670 --> 01:12:14.000
That's discernment.

01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:14.692
It's important.

01:12:14.692 --> 01:12:16.650
So these places of genius
are not only magnets,

01:12:16.650 --> 01:12:18.110
they're colanders.

01:12:18.110 --> 01:12:19.540
And the third is disorder.

01:12:19.540 --> 01:12:21.530
This is the chaos
we talked about.

01:12:21.530 --> 01:12:23.430
The low level of tension.

01:12:23.430 --> 01:12:26.790
Not war, but tension.

01:12:26.790 --> 01:12:29.420
A stirring of the pot.

01:12:29.420 --> 01:12:32.820
May you live in interesting
times, as the Chinese say.

01:12:32.820 --> 01:12:36.510
That applies well for
creative places as well.

01:12:36.510 --> 01:12:40.530
And then discomfort, which
we're adding here right now,

01:12:40.530 --> 01:12:44.570
because this speaks to the need
for constraints and challenges,

01:12:44.570 --> 01:12:47.110
and to have something
to push against.

01:12:47.110 --> 01:12:50.924
And to just bring Google in
briefly, if I can do that?

01:12:50.924 --> 01:12:51.590
VINT CERF: Sure.

01:12:51.590 --> 01:12:53.070
ERIC WEINER: OK.

01:12:53.070 --> 01:12:55.920
I'll be honest, one
thing that concerns

01:12:55.920 --> 01:13:00.330
me, but I think that Google
is doing well, is you

01:13:00.330 --> 01:13:01.600
want to attract talent.

01:13:01.600 --> 01:13:04.000
You want to bring in the
best and the brightest.

01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:10.430
But I think you don't want to
make people too comfortable.

01:13:10.430 --> 01:13:13.382
You want them to be challenged.

01:13:13.382 --> 01:13:15.340
VINT CERF: Do you want
to know how we did that?

01:13:15.340 --> 01:13:16.048
ERIC WEINER: How?

01:13:16.048 --> 01:13:19.090
VINT CERF: Well, you know how
we have these little mini cafe,

01:13:19.090 --> 01:13:20.450
micro kitchens everywhere?

01:13:20.450 --> 01:13:22.250
When I came to
Google, 10 years ago,

01:13:22.250 --> 01:13:23.580
it was junk food everywhere.

01:13:23.580 --> 01:13:25.710
We were in heaven.

01:13:25.710 --> 01:13:28.207
And then the junk food police
came along, and they said,

01:13:28.207 --> 01:13:29.290
you know what we're doing?

01:13:29.290 --> 01:13:31.760
We're destroying the health
of our best engineers.

01:13:31.760 --> 01:13:33.520
And so they took all
the junk food away,

01:13:33.520 --> 01:13:35.850
and there was this small
eruption after that.

01:13:35.850 --> 01:13:39.090
And the compromise was that
the good food is at eye level,

01:13:39.090 --> 01:13:40.686
and the not so good
food is down here,

01:13:40.686 --> 01:13:42.310
and the really junk
food is down there,

01:13:42.310 --> 01:13:44.300
and you have to
squat down to get it,

01:13:44.300 --> 01:13:46.090
and it's obvious when
you're doing that,

01:13:46.090 --> 01:13:48.380
and you get a little
exercise in the process.

01:13:48.380 --> 01:13:50.990
So that's how we managed to
generate a certain amount

01:13:50.990 --> 01:13:53.230
of creative discomfort.

01:13:53.230 --> 01:13:57.950
ERIC WEINER: A little
discomfort is good.

01:13:57.950 --> 01:14:01.220
Keep the constraints in there.

01:14:01.220 --> 01:14:04.870
You know, maybe people should
receive mild electric shocks

01:14:04.870 --> 01:14:08.820
randomly just to keep
them on their toes.

01:14:08.820 --> 01:14:10.709
So I think those are the key.

01:14:10.709 --> 01:14:12.500
I'd probably say, the
one thing is probably

01:14:12.500 --> 01:14:16.411
the openness to experience.

01:14:16.411 --> 01:14:18.160
You don't see a lot
of geniuses coming out

01:14:18.160 --> 01:14:20.600
of Pyongyang, North Korea.

01:14:20.600 --> 01:14:21.500
And why is that?

01:14:21.500 --> 01:14:23.090
This goes back to
my original thesis.

01:14:23.090 --> 01:14:25.420
Well, if you believe
that genius is genetic,

01:14:25.420 --> 01:14:27.920
then you have to say, well the
North Koreans have bad genes,

01:14:27.920 --> 01:14:28.730
well they don't.

01:14:28.730 --> 01:14:30.270
Their genetics are fine.

01:14:30.270 --> 01:14:32.160
Or if you believe it's
all about hard work,

01:14:32.160 --> 01:14:33.330
you would have to
say well, there

01:14:33.330 --> 01:14:35.204
are no geniuses because
they don't work hard,

01:14:35.204 --> 01:14:36.390
and they work plenty hard.

01:14:36.390 --> 01:14:37.515
VINT CERF: OK.

01:14:37.515 --> 01:14:39.140
ERIC WEINER: So what
are you left with?

01:14:39.140 --> 01:14:40.223
You're left with the soil.

01:14:40.223 --> 01:14:43.190
You're left with a
society that is not open.

01:14:43.190 --> 01:14:45.110
That's the opposite
of an open society.

01:14:45.110 --> 01:14:47.440
And I think that explains a lot.

01:14:47.440 --> 01:14:48.900
VINT CERF: It does indeed.

01:14:48.900 --> 01:14:52.820
Well let me ask all of us to
thank you for writing the book

01:14:52.820 --> 01:14:53.720
and joining us today.

01:14:53.720 --> 01:14:54.678
ERIC WEINER: Thank you.

01:14:54.678 --> 01:14:56.170
VINT CERF: Thank you.
