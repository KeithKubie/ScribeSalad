TODD KERPELMAN: We
would like to bring up

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:10.630
our last speaker of the day,
the fine gentleman in the back.

00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:11.940
This is RJ Mical.

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:14.190
He is a brilliant
guy who has lots

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:15.830
of brilliant ideas
about the future,

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:18.680
and he is going to share
some of them with you now.

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:21.800
So just a quick little wrap-up.

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:23.760
It will most likely
be mind blowing,

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:26.170
if it's like any other
conversation I've had with RJ.

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:29.037
And so with that,
let's welcome RJ Mical.

00:00:29.037 --> 00:00:29.864
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:29.864 --> 00:00:30.905
RJ MICAL: Thank you, sir.

00:00:30.905 --> 00:00:31.839
Thank you very much.

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:37.680
Hi, everyone.

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:41.850
Well, I'm here to make an
impassioned plea to you

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:46.100
today to make the strongest
request to Android developers

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:49.290
that I can make.

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:51.330
But let me start
first by talking

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:54.920
about where I think
everything is going.

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:59.610
We have this vision for where
games and entertainment,

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:01.200
in general, is
going, and I'd like

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:03.880
to start by sharing
that with you now.

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:05.880
Is there a microphone
I can walk around with?

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:07.400
I guess I can take this.

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:08.622
No?

00:01:08.622 --> 00:01:09.330
That's all right.

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:09.997
I'll stand here.

00:01:09.997 --> 00:01:10.705
That's all right.

00:01:10.705 --> 00:01:11.562
That's all right.

00:01:11.562 --> 00:01:16.790
I'm just not used to standing
still when I talk, you see.

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:23.810
So in the beginning,
there were games.

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:25.370
I mean, games go
all the way back

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:30.500
to caveman pushing stones
around on platforms of rock.

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:34.110
And in our beginning, in the
beginning of our industry,

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:35.530
there were games.

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:39.320
A long time ago, this
amazing, this miraculous thing

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:41.750
happened to our
industry, to our lives,

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:44.550
to our entire civilization.

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:48.030
And it started way
long time ago when

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:50.400
we started using
personal computers

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:52.490
for our everyday work.

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:55.740
And we started having lots
of computers in our offices,

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:58.020
and they became prevalent.

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:59.400
There became quite
a large number

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:02.337
of people that were familiar
with the idea of computers

00:02:02.337 --> 00:02:03.170
and were using them.

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:05.790
And then this amazing
thing happened

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:09.090
where we started taking
those computers home with us.

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:11.470
And we said that we
were taking them home

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:14.980
for games-- I mean, for work,
that we intended to take them

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:16.686
home from work, but
in fact, the truth

00:02:16.686 --> 00:02:19.060
was that we were taking them
home so we could play games,

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:21.170
so that we could play
solitaire at first,

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:22.920
and then it got more
and more elaborate.

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:25.820
The games became more and
more sophisticated over time.

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:29.320
And a long time
ago, our computers

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:31.460
at work, our computers
at home, they

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:35.510
became powerful enough to do
all the spreadsheets and all

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:39.000
the word processing that we
ever would want to do with them.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:40.150
But they didn't stop there.

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:42.820
They kept getting more
powerful, kept getting

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:45.210
more capabilities,
more features.

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:46.180
And why?

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:47.270
Because of games.

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:50.620
Because we wanted our games
to be richer, and better,

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:52.790
and more wonderful,
and more powerful.

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:56.350
And we had these
devices at home that

00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:59.500
could do our simple work for
us, but we kept empowering them,

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:02.860
kept getting better graphics,
better audio capabilities,

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:04.730
because we did it
for entertainment.

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:06.940
We did it because of games.

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:11.720
And we believe at Google that
this miracle then happened.

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:14.150
The first revolution came on us.

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:16.050
There was suddenly
this world that

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:19.650
was filled with all of
this amazing graphics

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:21.820
and audio capabilities,
this hardware

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:25.130
that they could accomplish all
of these great things for us.

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:29.560
And this like soil, this
fertile-- this rich soil

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:32.460
was ready for an
amazing thing to happen.

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:36.650
And out of that soil
came the worldwide web.

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:39.260
We believe that
the worldwide web

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:43.400
exists because of
entertainment, that it exists

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:47.410
because our games drove
the ability for this stuff

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:49.760
to come into existence.

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:52.450
And we think that
the next revolution

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:55.270
is coming upon us right now.

00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:57.910
It's coming upon us from
the fact that we're all

00:03:57.910 --> 00:04:01.570
walking around now with the
equivalent of PlayStation 2's

00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:02.480
in our pockets.

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:05.469
And a year from now, they're
going to be PlayStation

00:04:05.469 --> 00:04:08.010
3's, and the year after that,
they're going to be PlayStation

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:08.840
4's.

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:12.380
We are now walking around with
this kind of awesome hardware

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:12.990
capability.

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:15.730
But instead of what it
used to be-- hardware

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:19.370
tethered to our offices or to
the walls and our homes-- now

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:24.770
it's mobile now it goes with
us everywhere, all of the time.

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:27.640
The worldwide web
came into existence

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:30.990
because we wanted to
connect with each other.

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:33.460
We wanted to be part
of that community.

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:35.960
We wanted to
entertain ourselves,

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:38.930
to find one another, to
play with one another.

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:40.310
We wanted to be loved.

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:41.920
We wanted to be
recognized, and we

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:46.760
wanted to be seen as the
beautiful people that we are.

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:51.070
And I think that that same
thing is happening now,

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:55.340
but it's happening in a newer,
richer, and most amazing way

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:57.150
that you can't
even imagine where

00:04:57.150 --> 00:04:59.930
it's going, although I have
a few clues now that we've

00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:03.150
seen so far here at Google.

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:06.380
But the next
revolution is coming.

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:10.020
And we don't know exactly
what it's going to look like,

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:11.999
but we know how it's
going to be powered.

00:05:11.999 --> 00:05:13.790
It's going to be powered
with these devices

00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:15.081
that we're walking around with.

00:05:15.081 --> 00:05:18.670
We now have the compute
technology in our pockets

00:05:18.670 --> 00:05:21.880
to allow ourselves to connect,
and to connect with each other,

00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:25.030
to reach out to each other,
to share experiences,

00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:27.520
to share knowledge and
information with each other,

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:31.200
to share entertainment with each
other in a way that's much more

00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:33.390
dynamic, that's not
tethered to our homes,

00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:35.370
but it happens
anywhere-- anywhere

00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:38.650
we are, anytime we want, with
any small group of people,

00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:40.490
with any large group of people.

00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:43.850
It's a new way of looking at
each other and entertaining

00:05:43.850 --> 00:05:46.870
each other and communicating
with each other that's

00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:48.840
coming right around the corner.

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:53.970
And in my group
at Google, our job

00:05:53.970 --> 00:05:58.280
is to get this to happen,
to help accelerate it,

00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:01.400
to help put the
pieces in place that

00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:04.330
will allow this new way of
communicating with each other

00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:10.270
to become a reality, and also to
put together some examples that

00:06:10.270 --> 00:06:12.915
show the world what it is
that we're talking about,

00:06:12.915 --> 00:06:14.520
about where it's
all going and how

00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:17.170
it's all going to fit together.

00:06:17.170 --> 00:06:22.290
We think then that this
new thing that's coming

00:06:22.290 --> 00:06:27.150
needs a name, and so we
branded it Entertainment 2.0.

00:06:27.150 --> 00:06:29.640
It's where entertainment
really is going.

00:06:29.640 --> 00:06:34.150
It's no longer just games as
we know and no longer tied

00:06:34.150 --> 00:06:38.820
to our homes and to our offices,
but this new sort of cloud

00:06:38.820 --> 00:06:40.580
of entertainment
that's coming at us,

00:06:40.580 --> 00:06:45.290
where we have experiences
that don't have games that

00:06:45.290 --> 00:06:47.760
have a clear beginning
and a clear end.

00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:50.500
But instead where the
entertainment experiences

00:06:50.500 --> 00:06:54.160
we have are these sort
of continuous stream

00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:56.480
of an experience that
you jump in some time

00:06:56.480 --> 00:06:58.560
and you play a little
bit here, and you leave,

00:06:58.560 --> 00:07:00.310
and you come, and you
join it again later.

00:07:00.310 --> 00:07:03.640
And now you have this
device, and it's a phone,

00:07:03.640 --> 00:07:04.720
or it's a tablet.

00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:06.590
And then later ,
you're at your home,

00:07:06.590 --> 00:07:08.680
and now you're communicating
with the television,

00:07:08.680 --> 00:07:10.971
and you're using your console
device on the television,

00:07:10.971 --> 00:07:13.110
and it's all part of
the same experience.

00:07:13.110 --> 00:07:16.165
It's all part of the same
game, even though it's

00:07:16.165 --> 00:07:17.790
different aspects of
it, different ways

00:07:17.790 --> 00:07:19.690
of looking at it.

00:07:19.690 --> 00:07:21.710
But this stuff is coming at us.

00:07:24.380 --> 00:07:27.560
One of the requirements for
this to be able to happen,

00:07:27.560 --> 00:07:30.630
is that we need to open
standards, and open platforms,

00:07:30.630 --> 00:07:33.340
and the ability to
create this stuff,

00:07:33.340 --> 00:07:36.480
and to take control
of our own destiny,

00:07:36.480 --> 00:07:38.860
and to fashion the
things that we need.

00:07:38.860 --> 00:07:41.100
And this is why we
think that Android

00:07:41.100 --> 00:07:45.130
is the perfect platform for
this because it is open.

00:07:45.130 --> 00:07:47.000
It does allow us
to change things

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:49.500
and to make things work
the way that we want it to.

00:07:49.500 --> 00:07:52.590
Plus, as you guys probably
have already seen,

00:07:52.590 --> 00:07:56.350
both the Android development
team and the developer

00:07:56.350 --> 00:07:58.714
support team,
they're highly tuned

00:07:58.714 --> 00:07:59.880
to what's going on with you.

00:07:59.880 --> 00:08:03.270
And they're constantly looking
for feedback and suggestions

00:08:03.270 --> 00:08:07.220
and ways to improve the
system and make it better.

00:08:07.220 --> 00:08:09.330
We spent a lot of
energy, so far making

00:08:09.330 --> 00:08:12.570
Android robust as
a phone system,

00:08:12.570 --> 00:08:14.800
with a robust operating
system, and make sure

00:08:14.800 --> 00:08:17.030
that the device is solid.

00:08:17.030 --> 00:08:20.380
Now the next way to reach out
is to get it better for games,

00:08:20.380 --> 00:08:22.500
to make it better
for entertainment.

00:08:22.500 --> 00:08:25.115
And that's part of what
my group's job is to do

00:08:25.115 --> 00:08:28.210
is to make Android number
one in the game space.

00:08:28.210 --> 00:08:30.960
And this is part of what I
want to ask you guys for today.

00:08:33.750 --> 00:08:35.700
I'll make the bold
statement that I

00:08:35.700 --> 00:08:38.159
believe the console era is dead.

00:08:38.159 --> 00:08:41.330
I think we're at the
end of the console era.

00:08:41.330 --> 00:08:43.510
Well, I mean, with
a grain of salt.

00:08:43.510 --> 00:08:45.465
There will always be
console-like devices.

00:08:45.465 --> 00:08:47.090
And there will always
be someone that's

00:08:47.090 --> 00:08:49.960
trying to reach out and create
the bleeding-edge device.

00:08:49.960 --> 00:08:52.549
And there will always be the
consumers that want that device

00:08:52.549 --> 00:08:54.465
and are willing to pay
the extra money for it.

00:08:54.465 --> 00:08:58.610
But what I think is that the
days of the major players

00:08:58.610 --> 00:09:03.480
spending $500 million to
develop a new console that

00:09:03.480 --> 00:09:07.630
lives on in your living
room for seven years,

00:09:07.630 --> 00:09:09.000
those days are gone.

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:12.180
The thing that's coming now
is the kind of experience

00:09:12.180 --> 00:09:14.865
that we have now with our
phones and with our tablets.

00:09:14.865 --> 00:09:16.990
I think that's going to
happen with our televisions

00:09:16.990 --> 00:09:21.170
next as well, where it needs
to be updated all the time.

00:09:21.170 --> 00:09:22.570
It needs to be upgraded.

00:09:22.570 --> 00:09:25.800
We as consumers,
we as game players

00:09:25.800 --> 00:09:27.530
are no longer going
to be satisfied

00:09:27.530 --> 00:09:29.400
with having the same
hunk of hardware

00:09:29.400 --> 00:09:31.890
for seven, eight,
nine years in a row

00:09:31.890 --> 00:09:34.680
as they're planning with the
current generation of stuff.

00:09:34.680 --> 00:09:37.320
But instead, it's more like
our phones, and our tablets,

00:09:37.320 --> 00:09:40.840
where we find ways to
update them and upgrade them

00:09:40.840 --> 00:09:42.180
all the time.

00:09:42.180 --> 00:09:44.650
And that whole
experience is going

00:09:44.650 --> 00:09:47.500
to be reflected in the way
entertainment works as well.

00:09:47.500 --> 00:09:50.550
That we're going to see
this next generation

00:09:50.550 --> 00:09:51.720
of entertainment.

00:09:51.720 --> 00:09:54.060
That is based on the
fact that there's

00:09:54.060 --> 00:09:55.950
lots of different
hardware out there

00:09:55.950 --> 00:09:58.420
and lots of different
kinds of capabilities,

00:09:58.420 --> 00:10:00.420
and that we're going to
have to write games that

00:10:00.420 --> 00:10:02.230
take into account
the fact that there's

00:10:02.230 --> 00:10:05.470
many different displays,
many different units.

00:10:05.470 --> 00:10:06.490
Today it's Android.

00:10:06.490 --> 00:10:08.100
Tomorrow it'll be iOS.

00:10:08.100 --> 00:10:09.260
Chrome's coming.

00:10:09.260 --> 00:10:12.470
Maybe Windows will get
hooked into everything

00:10:12.470 --> 00:10:15.570
that we're looking at in the
long run, because what we're

00:10:15.570 --> 00:10:18.690
looking at is the big
picture of entertainment.

00:10:18.690 --> 00:10:23.410
And what we're looking at is not
just what Android has to offer,

00:10:23.410 --> 00:10:26.410
but instead what all
of Google has to offer.

00:10:26.410 --> 00:10:30.880
And this, we think, is what
Entertainment 2.0 is really

00:10:30.880 --> 00:10:32.450
all about.

00:10:32.450 --> 00:10:35.630
Because today it's games.

00:10:35.630 --> 00:10:38.180
But tomorrow it's going
to be something that's

00:10:38.180 --> 00:10:40.570
integrated into
all of our lives.

00:10:40.570 --> 00:10:43.680
And it's something that
becomes part of everything

00:10:43.680 --> 00:10:49.420
we do every day, where the
entertainment, and the ads,

00:10:49.420 --> 00:10:52.160
and the movies that you
watch, and the TV shows,

00:10:52.160 --> 00:10:54.410
and all of it, becomes
part of a whole.

00:10:54.410 --> 00:10:56.850
And the games just
naturally flow out

00:10:56.850 --> 00:10:59.430
of the TV shows that we watch,
which flow out of the movies

00:10:59.430 --> 00:11:00.520
that we watch.

00:11:00.520 --> 00:11:02.209
I mean, we have
these wild dreams

00:11:02.209 --> 00:11:03.250
for where it's all going.

00:11:03.250 --> 00:11:05.900
And in our wildest
of dreams, we see

00:11:05.900 --> 00:11:10.260
that TV shows are
coming where there's

00:11:10.260 --> 00:11:12.890
that can of soda in the TV show.

00:11:12.890 --> 00:11:15.750
And it's a generic one
that the producer puts in.

00:11:15.750 --> 00:11:18.010
And when that TV show
is broadcast to you

00:11:18.010 --> 00:11:20.950
on your device,
that generic can is

00:11:20.950 --> 00:11:23.835
replaced with a can of soda
that's the brand that you want,

00:11:23.835 --> 00:11:25.460
because that's the
thing that you like,

00:11:25.460 --> 00:11:27.043
and the advertisers
are willing to pay

00:11:27.043 --> 00:11:30.610
for that or any other sorts
of substitutions for ads that

00:11:30.610 --> 00:11:34.910
are live in a movie or a TV
show or a game or any experience

00:11:34.910 --> 00:11:36.070
that you're having.

00:11:36.070 --> 00:11:38.390
That's a simple example
of where all of it's going

00:11:38.390 --> 00:11:40.480
and how all of it ties together.

00:11:40.480 --> 00:11:44.980
And we think that where
entertainment is really

00:11:44.980 --> 00:11:48.680
going, where the big
value that Google

00:11:48.680 --> 00:11:53.040
has to add over the next
decades, comes from the fact

00:11:53.040 --> 00:11:57.550
that entertainment is going to
be woven into not just games,

00:11:57.550 --> 00:11:59.930
but everything that
we've got around us,

00:11:59.930 --> 00:12:02.380
and everything in particular,
that Google has to offer.

00:12:02.380 --> 00:12:07.230
You look at Knowledge
Graph, Maps, Street View,

00:12:07.230 --> 00:12:11.350
self-driving cars, Fiber,
Glass, all these other things

00:12:11.350 --> 00:12:14.640
that are happening inside of
Google, tons of other stuff

00:12:14.640 --> 00:12:16.210
that we can't even
talk about that's

00:12:16.210 --> 00:12:18.510
coming with the next
generation stuff for us

00:12:18.510 --> 00:12:20.700
to connect with each
other-- all the wearables,

00:12:20.700 --> 00:12:22.680
everything that's coming at us.

00:12:22.680 --> 00:12:26.560
Google has these
amazing resources

00:12:26.560 --> 00:12:32.330
that we want to make
available to game developers.

00:12:32.330 --> 00:12:34.820
As a great example-- AI.

00:12:34.820 --> 00:12:37.730
We think that we
need a real AI that's

00:12:37.730 --> 00:12:40.630
based on the kind of knowledge
that a company like Google

00:12:40.630 --> 00:12:43.830
is able to accumulate
and that we can then

00:12:43.830 --> 00:12:45.820
make available to
game developers

00:12:45.820 --> 00:12:47.880
worldwide, where
you can incorporate

00:12:47.880 --> 00:12:51.790
that kind of knowledge,
that kind of experience

00:12:51.790 --> 00:12:55.630
with the human race into the
very design of your games.

00:12:55.630 --> 00:12:59.284
And, well, I could tell you
jokes about self-driving cars,

00:12:59.284 --> 00:13:00.450
but I'm already out of time.

00:13:00.450 --> 00:13:03.814
But we've got huge ideas
where all of it's going.

00:13:03.814 --> 00:13:06.480
But the big thing that I want to
ask you today, because I know I

00:13:06.480 --> 00:13:08.140
am out of time,
so I'll stop here.

00:13:10.950 --> 00:13:15.170
We need to find the right
magic, the right way,

00:13:15.170 --> 00:13:18.900
to make this content
available to you guys.

00:13:18.900 --> 00:13:21.910
I use the word "magic, " and
that's because that's how we

00:13:21.910 --> 00:13:23.900
refer to it inside Google.

00:13:23.900 --> 00:13:29.120
It's that Google magic,
that cloud of awesomeness

00:13:29.120 --> 00:13:32.870
that Google has to offer
to all of civilization,

00:13:32.870 --> 00:13:35.340
and, in particular to
you guys that you could

00:13:35.340 --> 00:13:38.350
use in your entertainment, the
software that you put together,

00:13:38.350 --> 00:13:42.000
and that you can make it better,
richer, more engaging, more

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:45.310
human, or make more money
off of it, because you found

00:13:45.310 --> 00:13:48.510
clever ways to use our APIs
to include ads in your games,

00:13:48.510 --> 00:13:49.530
or whatever.

00:13:49.530 --> 00:13:50.720
We don't know.

00:13:50.720 --> 00:13:53.920
What we're looking for
is answers from you guys.

00:13:53.920 --> 00:13:56.920
And so what I'm hoping
is that all of you

00:13:56.920 --> 00:13:59.010
will come find me after this.

00:13:59.010 --> 00:14:01.800
I wish I put a slide together
with my email address on it,

00:14:01.800 --> 00:14:03.360
but I don't have
one, unfortunately.

00:14:03.360 --> 00:14:05.370
But I'll be around
for a while, if you

00:14:05.370 --> 00:14:08.910
want to come up and find me or
get my address from these guys.

00:14:08.910 --> 00:14:10.700
I'm at Google as well.

00:14:10.700 --> 00:14:12.970
My LDAP is easy to remember.

00:14:12.970 --> 00:14:13.970
It's gameman@google.com.

00:14:16.740 --> 00:14:18.840
And it's a pretty
awesome email address

00:14:18.840 --> 00:14:23.010
to have-- reflects what
the company thinks,

00:14:23.010 --> 00:14:26.030
where it's going, and what
they would like our group

00:14:26.030 --> 00:14:27.090
to try to accomplish.

00:14:27.090 --> 00:14:32.780
And so my request to you is
please look at everything

00:14:32.780 --> 00:14:34.860
that Google has to offer.

00:14:34.860 --> 00:14:37.010
Look at what Android's
like for you now,

00:14:37.010 --> 00:14:38.520
what the development
experience is

00:14:38.520 --> 00:14:41.360
like, what it's like
to incorporate content.

00:14:41.360 --> 00:14:43.360
The sort of stuff that
Colt was just showing you

00:14:43.360 --> 00:14:46.710
is an awesome example
of the kind of response

00:14:46.710 --> 00:14:48.950
that you're already getting
from the DevRel guys.

00:14:48.950 --> 00:14:50.799
And they've done a
lot of this already.

00:14:50.799 --> 00:14:52.340
I'm sure the framework
guys reach out

00:14:52.340 --> 00:14:54.390
to everyone all
the time as well.

00:14:54.390 --> 00:14:56.560
We're joining that group,
reaching out to you

00:14:56.560 --> 00:14:59.690
and asking for your input,
asking for your advice

00:14:59.690 --> 00:15:04.410
about how can we make
Google available to you

00:15:04.410 --> 00:15:06.150
as game developers.

00:15:06.150 --> 00:15:08.160
Over the next few months,
between now and I/O,

00:15:08.160 --> 00:15:10.690
we're putting together some
really interesting example code

00:15:10.690 --> 00:15:12.065
that we're going
to put out there

00:15:12.065 --> 00:15:14.280
that shows some of the
stuff we're talking about,

00:15:14.280 --> 00:15:17.630
how you could use Knowledge
Graph real time in a game,

00:15:17.630 --> 00:15:20.450
how you can take advantage of
some of these other things that

00:15:20.450 --> 00:15:22.600
are available from Google.

00:15:22.600 --> 00:15:25.120
And so we won't just talk.

00:15:25.120 --> 00:15:28.040
We'll have actual
examples for you to use.

00:15:28.040 --> 00:15:30.540
But we ask you guys,
please, reach out to us

00:15:30.540 --> 00:15:35.980
and let us know what you want
and how you can use Google

00:15:35.980 --> 00:15:40.610
to empower yourselves and
make your games even better.

00:15:40.610 --> 00:15:41.177
So that's it.

00:15:41.177 --> 00:15:42.760
That's the end of
my speech for today.

00:15:42.760 --> 00:15:43.764
Are we taking questions?

00:15:43.764 --> 00:15:45.180
Or there's not
time for questions.

00:15:45.180 --> 00:15:45.810
All right.

00:15:45.810 --> 00:15:46.980
So we're out of here.

00:15:46.980 --> 00:15:47.920
We're out of here.

00:15:47.920 --> 00:15:49.110
Thanks, everyone.

00:15:49.110 --> 00:15:55.960
[APPLAUSE]

00:15:55.960 --> 00:15:57.210
TODD KERPELMAN: Thank you, RJ.

00:15:57.210 --> 00:15:59.781
All right, raise your hand if
you learned something today.

00:15:59.781 --> 00:16:01.280
All right, raise
your hand if you're

00:16:01.280 --> 00:16:03.426
excited to go get
some beer somewhere.

00:16:03.426 --> 00:16:04.950
All right, just as many of you.

00:16:04.950 --> 00:16:06.190
Thank you so much for coming.

00:16:06.190 --> 00:16:07.898
Thank you, everybody,
on the live stream,

00:16:07.898 --> 00:16:10.910
and we will see you next year.
