00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:06.540
The example here says we have a sort
of system that has three users.

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:10.520
The users are A, B, C,
because rows correspond to users.

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:15.430
And we have three resources as well,
we calling them X, Y and Z.

00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:18.000
These are three objects
of the resources we have.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.360
And if we look at the matrix says
well A can read write execute.

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:27.700
Object X can only read object Y and
has no access to object Z.

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:33.000
B can read write Y and
can read execute Z and things like that.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.430
So this matrix actually tells you who
can do what given the three users and

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:38.940
the three sources we have.

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:41.900
So if you want to implement
the information that's in this access

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:43.010
control matrix.

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:46.920
Well using ACLs then we look
at what's at the top here.

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:50.780
So what would ACLs or
ACLs correspond to object.

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:53.020
So the first object is X,

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:56.960
first go on you find user A who
has read write execute permission.

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:00.870
So that's an entry in the list that
we're going to, actually in this case

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:04.819
the list is only going to have one
entry because B has no access, C has no

00:01:04.819 --> 00:01:08.270
access, those are null entries that we
don't need to represent in this list.

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:12.550
So the ACL for X it's just going to
be this one entry which says,

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:15.570
user A can read, write,
and execute this object.

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:20.320
Still talking with ACLs, if you look
at Y, the second resource we have here.

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:24.480
Actually, here we're going to have three
entries in the ACL, one for each user.

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:27.285
A is going to be able to read it,
B can read, write it.

00:01:27.285 --> 00:01:28.900
C can read write it, too.

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:32.100
Similarly for the last resource,
we're going to have two entries.

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:36.040
A has no access, but B and
C do, so we can read and

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:39.150
execute it and she can read and
execute it as well.

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:43.470
So this information that we have in the
access control matrix gets represented

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:46.090
with three access control lists.

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:47.580
One for each object.

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:49.610
This is for X, for Y, and for Z.

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:53.955
Now another way to represent this
very same information is to using

00:01:53.955 --> 00:01:56.250
capability lists or C-lists.

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:59.050
So remember C-lists are for user.

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:04.460
So we have to have a C-list for user A,
one for user B, and one for user C.

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:08.639
If you look at A,
it has access to both X and Y.

00:02:08.639 --> 00:02:11.030
So the C-list would have two entries.

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:14.770
If user A has access for resource X and

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:16.820
the access rights
are read write execute.

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:19.890
Similarly user A can read resource Y.

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:22.732
So this is the C-list of user A.

00:02:22.732 --> 00:02:24.440
Similarly C-list for

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:28.980
user B is going to be no access for
resource X, so nothing for X.

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:32.720
But for Y we're going to have read
write access and similarly for

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:35.210
Z we're going to have
read execute access.

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:37.498
So this C-list is going
to have two entries.

00:02:37.498 --> 00:02:40.760
And the C-list is going to look
the same for user C because B and

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:42.740
C have same kind of access.

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:45.350
The given set of resources
that we have here.

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:48.225
ACLs, you go vertical per resource.

00:02:48.225 --> 00:02:52.280
C-list, you go horizontal or
row-wise per user, so

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:55.560
we are talking about how you
implement an Access Control Matrix.

00:02:55.560 --> 00:03:00.080
Well, one way is to define or
have this list that we have, and

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:05.390
we'll talk about where these lists get
stored or maintained, but the ACL or

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:11.489
ACM information gets captured
either in ACLs or in C-lists.
