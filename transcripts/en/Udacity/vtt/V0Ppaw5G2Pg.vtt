00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
So with the heuristic function I've given you of simply the minimum number of steps

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000
it takes to get to the goal in the absence of obstacles,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
you can now construct an algorithm that implements a star

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
by maintaining not just the G-values but also the F-values,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
which is G plus the heuristic.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
Out should come an expand table that looks exactly like this

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
that are signs -1 not just to the obstacles but everything over here

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
that has not to be expanded according to the heuristic.

00:00:28.000 --> 09:59:59.000
That's your task for the next quiz.
