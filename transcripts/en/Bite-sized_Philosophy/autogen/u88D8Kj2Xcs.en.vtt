interaction physical play that kid it's
 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:37.880
interaction physical play that kid it's
a different sort of kid because the

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890
a different sort of kid because the
 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:39.590
a different sort of kid because the
first thing the kid knows it's not a

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600
first thing the kid knows it's not a
 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.430
first thing the kid knows it's not a
rule the first thing the kid knows is

rule the first thing the kid knows is
 

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:47.270
rule the first thing the kid knows is
how forceful can he be with you so that

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280
how forceful can he be with you so that

it's exciting and interesting and fun
 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:51.709
it's exciting and interesting and fun
but it's not too much and that's really

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719
but it's not too much and that's really
 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:53.060
but it's not too much and that's really
an interesting questioning because

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070
an interesting questioning because
 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:56.569
an interesting questioning because
actually to really play a good game like

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579
actually to really play a good game like
 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:58.459
actually to really play a good game like
a physical contact game like wrestling

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469
a physical contact game like wrestling
 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:00.290
a physical contact game like wrestling
with a kid is that you want to let that

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300
with a kid is that you want to let that
 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:03.290
with a kid is that you want to let that
kid come right up to the edge of hurting

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300
kid come right up to the edge of hurting
 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.690
kid come right up to the edge of hurting
you and the closer the kid gets to the

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700
you and the closer the kid gets to the
 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.490
you and the closer the kid gets to the
edge the more fun it is for both because

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500
edge the more fun it is for both because
 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.219
edge the more fun it is for both because
the kid will give you a whack and it go

00:01:09.219 --> 00:01:09.229
the kid will give you a whack and it go
 

00:01:09.229 --> 00:01:12.289
the kid will give you a whack and it go
you know and and that's it's good you

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299
you know and and that's it's good you
 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:13.219
you know and and that's it's good you
know and then maybe he'll give you a

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229
know and then maybe he'll give you a
 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:14.719
know and then maybe he'll give you a
harder whack to see if he can get away

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729
harder whack to see if he can get away
 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:16.340
harder whack to see if he can get away
with it and kids will often they'll come

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350
with it and kids will often they'll come
 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:18.469
with it and kids will often they'll come
up to you whack you and then run away

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479
up to you whack you and then run away
 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:19.820
up to you whack you and then run away
and then they'll look and if you're

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830
and then they'll look and if you're
 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:21.140
and then they'll look and if you're
laughing then they'll come back and try

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150
laughing then they'll come back and try
 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:22.940
laughing then they'll come back and try
a harder one and then you know they're

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950
a harder one and then you know they're
 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:24.469
a harder one and then you know they're
doing it incrementally because it's

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479
doing it incrementally because it's
 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:26.289
doing it incrementally because it's
exploratory behavior and part of the

00:01:26.289 --> 00:01:26.299
exploratory behavior and part of the
 

00:01:26.299 --> 00:01:30.200
exploratory behavior and part of the
exploration is okay what our bodies like

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210
exploration is okay what our bodies like
 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:34.010
exploration is okay what our bodies like
and the answer that is well what can you

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020
and the answer that is well what can you
 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:36.620
and the answer that is well what can you
get away with doing to them but it's a

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630
get away with doing to them but it's a
 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:38.420
get away with doing to them but it's a
more sophisticated answer to which is

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430
more sophisticated answer to which is
 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:41.660
more sophisticated answer to which is
what can you get away with doing to them

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670
what can you get away with doing to them
 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:43.999
what can you get away with doing to them
in a way that allows you to continue to

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009
in a way that allows you to continue to
 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:47.330
in a way that allows you to continue to
explore without fear or punishment and

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340
explore without fear or punishment and
 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:48.889
explore without fear or punishment and
without blowing the whole game to bits

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899
without blowing the whole game to bits
 

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:51.380
without blowing the whole game to bits
okay so how do you figure that out you

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390
okay so how do you figure that out you
 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:54.020
okay so how do you figure that out you
do not talk about it because you can't

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030
do not talk about it because you can't
 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:57.319
do not talk about it because you can't
you have to act it out it's like so so

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329
you have to act it out it's like so so
 

00:01:57.329 --> 00:01:58.789
you have to act it out it's like so so
the kids hitting you and wrestling and

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799
the kids hitting you and wrestling and
 

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:00.050
the kids hitting you and wrestling and
pulling your hair and doing all these

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060
pulling your hair and doing all these
 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:01.789
pulling your hair and doing all these
things and you're modifying its behavior

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799
things and you're modifying its behavior
 

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:04.370
things and you're modifying its behavior
very very carefully and and and in my

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380
very very carefully and and and in my
 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:06.800
very very carefully and and and in my
miniscule detail and then you get a kid

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810
miniscule detail and then you get a kid
 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:08.180
miniscule detail and then you get a kid
who can like wrestle like mad and

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190

put them face down you put your elbow on
them you bend them around you throw them

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:41.670
them you bend them around you throw them
 

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:43.309
them you bend them around you throw them
in the air and catch them you know

00:02:43.309 --> 00:02:43.319
in the air and catch them you know
 

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:44.630
in the air and catch them you know
you've grabbed it by the leg and maybe

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:44.640
you've grabbed it by the leg and maybe
 

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:46.580

you're showing the kid is here's a bunch

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:48.840
you're showing the kid is here's a bunch
 

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:50.900
you're showing the kid is here's a bunch
of things that your body can do and it's

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:50.910
of things that your body can do and it's
 

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:52.520
of things that your body can do and it's
okay that they're they're being done

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:52.530
okay that they're they're being done
 

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:55.550
okay that they're they're being done
that it isn't gonna hurt you and you're

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:55.560
that it isn't gonna hurt you and you're
 

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:57.080
that it isn't gonna hurt you and you're
not talking about you're showing them

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:57.090
not talking about you're showing them
 

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:59.210
not talking about you're showing them
and so the kid gets kind of confident

00:02:59.210 --> 00:02:59.220
and so the kid gets kind of confident
 

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:02.979
and so the kid gets kind of confident
about what he or she can withstand

00:03:02.979 --> 00:03:02.989
about what he or she can withstand
 

00:03:02.989 --> 00:03:05.390
about what he or she can withstand
physically and the difference between

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:05.400
physically and the difference between
 

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:08.330
physically and the difference between
pain and not pain and the difference

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:08.340
pain and not pain and the difference
 

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:11.360
pain and not pain and the difference
between fear and not fear and win

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:11.370
between fear and not fear and win
 

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:12.590
between fear and not fear and win
something's threatening and when it's

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:12.600
something's threatening and when it's
 

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:15.170
something's threatening and when it's
not it's very sophisticated it's very

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:15.180
not it's very sophisticated it's very
 

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:17.690
not it's very sophisticated it's very
sophisticated behavior and that's partly

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:17.700
sophisticated behavior and that's partly
 

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:20.330
