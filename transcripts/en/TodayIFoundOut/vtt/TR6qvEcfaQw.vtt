00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:21.740
According to two studies, one done at the
Ataturk University in Turkey (in 1991) and

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:26.770
another at the University of Manchester in
England (in 2006), both dogs and cats are

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:28.830
typically right or left pawed.

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:33.160
According to the Ataturk University study,
the majority of domestic cats are right pawed

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:38.890
(50%), 10% of them are ambidextrous, and the
remaining 40% favor their left paw.

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:42.650
Dogs, on the other hand, according to the
University of Manchester study, tend to be

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:48.940
more evenly split with around 50% being left
pawed and 50% being right pawed, with a statistically

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:51.930
insignificant number being ambidextrous.

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:55.650
In addition to that, there seems to be a connection
between the gender of the animal and which

00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:58.350
paw is dominate in both cats and dogs.

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:02.441
Specifically, female cats and dogs typically
will have their right paw be dominate, while

00:01:02.441 --> 00:01:04.270
males tend to go with the left paw.

00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:08.340
However, if the animal has been spayed or
neutered at an early age, this distinction

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:09.780
goes away.

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:13.730
Determining if your cat or dog is left or
right pawed or ambidextrous isn’t as simple

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:17.780
as running one test, such as giving them a
toy to play with just out of their reach and

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:19.900
seeing which paw they reach with.

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:23.890
This is because their paw preference is often
weekly expressed, unlike with humans.

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:27.870
Thus, in order to accurately determine your
pet’s paw preference, you need to run such

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:31.200
tests several dozen times to see the trends.

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.840
Some helpful such tests for dogs and cats
include: if you’ve taught your dog to shake

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:37.539
hands, which paw do they seem to like to use
the most?

00:01:37.539 --> 00:01:41.440
If your dog or cat is playing on its back
and you put your hand just out of their reach,

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:43.910
which paw do they reach for your hand with?

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:48.400
You can also try putting a treat or a toy
just out of their reach underneath a bookshelf/coffee

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:53.640
table/couch /etc. and see which paw they typically
try to reach for the treat or toy with.

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:57.390
You can put some peanut butter on the top
center of their nose and see which paw they

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:58.740
use to get it off with.

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:03.720
For both dogs and cats, if the animal wants
inside or into a room you’re in, which paw

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:06.069
do they typically use to scratch at the door?

00:02:06.069 --> 00:02:09.390
Another good one is to put a treat underneath
something and see which paw they use first

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:11.280
to try to uncover the treat with.

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:15.450
Yet another test is to place a small piece
of paper or plastic on a smooth surface so

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:19.580
it can slide, and then place a tasty, lickable
treat on the paper.

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:25.060
When the dog or cat licks it, inevitably the
paper/plastic will slide and they will likely

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:28.470
use one of their paws to stop it from sliding
while they lick.

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:32.750
In all these cases, record which paw is used
and once you’ve done several dozen such

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:35.990
tests, check to see if there is a clear dominate
paw.

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:38.340
If not, continue on until one emerges.

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:43.260
If you’ve done 100-200 or so such tests
and there is no noticeable paw preference,

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:45.160
your animal is probably ambidextrous.

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:50.100
That being said, it should be noted that cats,
as in all things, tend to be trickier to figure

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:51.320
out than dogs.

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:55.530
For instance, it’s been observed that when
cats are playing, they typically don’t exhibit

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:59.630
much in the way of paw preference, but when
they want something, like a treat, it’s

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:04.150
then that they’ll usually use their dominant
paw first, unless they are simply one of those

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:06.550
10% or so that are ambidextrous.

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:09.680
Bonus Facts:
• Horses also can be left or right hoofed

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:10.960
or ambidextrous.

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:15.050
While for cats and dogs their paw preference
is fairly inconsequential, for race horses

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:17.580
particularly, knowing this information can
be very important.

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:22.230
For instance, in horse racing in America,
horses run counterclockwise and when turning,

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:26.491
turn to the left, so which hoof is their dominate
can be important in that, “You have to work

00:03:26.491 --> 00:03:31.710
to get them to take the lead they prefer less,”
says Dr. Sharon Crowell-Davis at the College

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:34.770
of Veterinary Medicine at the University of
Georgia.

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:39.530
For courses where the horse has to turn multiple
ways, an ambidextrous horse then is more desirable

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:43.629
than one who has a hoof preference.

00:03:43.629 --> 00:03:45.230
• There is a cat who loves playing the piano.

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:49.850
(And for the record, she’s right pawed,
though uses both paws to play and even sometimes

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:53.750
uses her head to play more notes when her
paws are occupied on other keys.)

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:58.370
The cat is named Nora, owned by Betsy Alexander
who is a piano teacher.

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:03.280
Nora enjoys playing the piano on a daily basis,
even sometimes playing duets with humans.

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:07.300
She first started playing around a year old
and has continued to this day, even being

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:09.020
filmed playing when no one is around to hear.

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:11.105
You can see a video of this here in the link
in the show notes.

00:04:11.105 --> 00:04:14.819
• The idea that people who are left handed
are naturally disposed to evil has been around

00:04:14.819 --> 00:04:17.120
for as long as we have recorded history.

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:19.430
The Devil is mostly portrayed as left handed.

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:24.860
The Bible mentions right handedness positively
over 100 times, while left handedness is mentioned

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:30.150
only 25 times and every time is negative.

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:33.279
• Domestic house cats are known to be able
to fall from any height without suffering

00:04:33.279 --> 00:04:36.110
fatal wounds most of the time, even when landing
on concrete.

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:37.960
You can learn more about this in episode #93
of this podcast.

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:40.319
• The longest lived domestic cat was named
Creme Puff.

00:04:40.319 --> 00:04:47.870
She lived from August 3, 1967 to August 6,
2005, a span of 38 years and 3 days.

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:51.470
This is well over double the normal life span
for domestic cats, which is typically around

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:55.819
12-14 years for males and 13-15 years for
females.

00:04:55.819 --> 00:05:00.100
Interestingly, the owner of Creme Puff, Jake
Perry, also raised a sphynx cat which was

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:06.830
born in 1964 and didn’t die until 1998,
a span of 34 years and 2 months.

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:09.710
The cat’s name was “Grandpa Rexs Allen”.

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:13.629
Why Perry’s two cats lived so long isn’t
entirely known, however, he didn’t usually

00:05:13.629 --> 00:05:15.279
feed them store bought cat food.

00:05:15.279 --> 00:05:20.229
Rather, he raised them on a variety of “natural”
foods; prominent among these foods were: bacon,

00:05:20.229 --> 00:05:23.169
eggs, asparagus, and broccoli, among other
things.

00:05:23.169 --> 00:05:27.389
This can be a somewhat dangerous practice
normally as cats require certain nutrients

00:05:27.389 --> 00:05:30.379
they won’t always get if they are just eating
“human” food.

00:05:30.379 --> 00:05:34.629
For instance, cats will go blind fairly quickly
(and permanently) if they don’t get enough

00:05:34.629 --> 00:05:36.460
taurine, found in muscle.

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:40.629
Cats also require a high amount of protein
and calcium to maintain proper health.

00:05:40.629 --> 00:05:44.849
This high amount of protein consumed by cats
is thought to be why dogs like cat poop so

00:05:44.849 --> 00:05:46.460
much, with it being very protein-rich.

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:53.330
• The documented record for the most kittens
born to one cat is currently held by a cat

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:54.330
named “Dusty”.

00:05:54.330 --> 00:05:59.849
She gave birth to 420 kittens in her lifetime
and even had a litter at the very old age

00:05:59.849 --> 00:06:03.930
(for a cat) of 18 years old.

00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:08.159
• The most kittens in one litter is 14,
a feat accomplished by a cat named Bluebell.

00:06:08.159 --> 00:06:14.419
Amazingly, all 14 kittens survived, which
is rare in large litters of kittens.

00:06:14.419 --> 00:06:19.050
• The smallest adult cat on record was named
Tinker Toy. Tinker Toy as an adult cat weighed

00:06:19.050 --> 00:06:25.099
just one pound, eight ounces and measured
in at just 2.75 inches tall and 7.5 inches

00:06:25.099 --> 00:06:26.099
long.

00:06:26.099 --> 00:06:31.159
• The heaviest cat in the world was 46 pounds
and named Himmy.

00:06:31.159 --> 00:06:46.959
This cat had a waistline of 33 inches.
