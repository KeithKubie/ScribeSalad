networks so first of all why we care
 

00:00:34.719 --> 00:00:39.750
networks so first of all why we care
about emerging markets so we have almost

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:39.760
about emerging markets so we have almost
 

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:42.450

android app where they are you know and

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:18.340
android app where they are you know and
 

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:19.770
android app where they are you know and
where they are typically you know with

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:19.780
where they are typically you know with
 

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:22.500

no offense for is users are android
 

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:24.570
no offense for is users are android
devices usually cheap android devices

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:24.580
devices usually cheap android devices
 

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:28.190
devices usually cheap android devices
and network which are not very powerful

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200
and network which are not very powerful
 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.180
and network which are not very powerful
so we're going to talk about devices

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:30.190
so we're going to talk about devices
 

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:33.450
so we're going to talk about devices
first does anybody here care to guess

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:33.460
first does anybody here care to guess
 

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:35.640
first does anybody here care to guess
how many different android devices are

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:35.650
how many different android devices are
 

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:40.890
how many different android devices are
out there in the market number five

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:40.900
out there in the market number five
 

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:44.700
out there in the market number five
hundred a thousand ten thousand the

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:44.710
hundred a thousand ten thousand the
 

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:47.010
hundred a thousand ten thousand the
right answer is 10,000 you got that so

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:47.020
right answer is 10,000 you got that so
 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:48.450
right answer is 10,000 you got that so
there are about 10,000 devices and

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:48.460
there are about 10,000 devices and
 

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:50.460
there are about 10,000 devices and
actually the number keeps increasing so

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:50.470
actually the number keeps increasing so
 

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:52.860
actually the number keeps increasing so
that that is about go see you know six

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:52.870
that that is about go see you know six
 

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:54.150
that that is about go see you know six
months ago it was about ten thousand i'm

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:54.160
months ago it was about ten thousand i'm
 

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:55.320
months ago it was about ten thousand i'm
not sure what the what it is right now

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:55.330
not sure what the what it is right now
 

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:57.810
not sure what the what it is right now
and of course the challenge is how do we

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:57.820
and of course the challenge is how do we
 

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:00.030
and of course the challenge is how do we
actually test and how do we reason about

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:00.040
actually test and how do we reason about
 

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:01.320
actually test and how do we reason about
10,000 devices they're all very

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:01.330
10,000 devices they're all very
 

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:03.300
10,000 devices they're all very
different well the way we reason about

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:03.310
different well the way we reason about
 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:04.890
different well the way we reason about
them is that we come up with this

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:04.900
them is that we come up with this
 

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:07.110
them is that we come up with this
approach called device here class so

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:07.120
approach called device here class so
 

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:08.999
approach called device here class so
what's device year class quite simply

00:02:08.999 --> 00:02:09.009
what's device year class quite simply
 

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:11.190
what's device year class quite simply
it's no matter what the device was

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:11.200
it's no matter what the device was
 

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:13.200
it's no matter what the device was
produced it's the year at which this

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:13.210
produced it's the year at which this
 

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:15.090
produced it's the year at which this
device with those characteristics would

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:15.100
device with those characteristics would
 

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:16.350
device with those characteristics would
have been the flagship device on the

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:16.360
have been the flagship device on the
 

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:18.510
have been the flagship device on the
market so here's how it works

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:18.520
market so here's how it works
 

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:20.670
market so here's how it works
here is the recent device pretty popular

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:20.680
here is the recent device pretty popular
 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:23.460
here is the recent device pretty popular
device from other all of course came out

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:23.470
device from other all of course came out
 

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:25.710
device from other all of course came out
in 2014 but it has those characteristics

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:25.720
in 2014 but it has those characteristics
 

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:28.410
in 2014 but it has those characteristics
it has two cpu cores 1.2 g hurts clock

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:28.420
it has two cpu cores 1.2 g hurts clock
 

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:31.140
it has two cpu cores 1.2 g hurts clock
speed and one gigabyte of ram and let's

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:31.150
speed and one gigabyte of ram and let's
 

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:32.880
speed and one gigabyte of ram and let's
compare it with galaxy s2 which is a

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:32.890
compare it with galaxy s2 which is a
 

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:36.720
compare it with galaxy s2 which is a
very popular device from 2011 has very

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:36.730
very popular device from 2011 has very
 

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:37.980
very popular device from 2011 has very
similar characteristics as far as these

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:37.990
similar characteristics as far as these
 

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:40.230
similar characteristics as far as these
three characteristics go and in a

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:40.240
three characteristics go and in a
 

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:41.670
three characteristics go and in a
thousand eleven that was the flagship

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:41.680
thousand eleven that was the flagship
 

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:44.460
thousand eleven that was the flagship
device so as a result we're going to say

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:44.470
device so as a result we're going to say
 

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:45.990
device so as a result we're going to say
hey both of those devices are you a

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:46.000
hey both of those devices are you a
 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.200
hey both of those devices are you a
class 2011 devices and again there are

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:49.210
class 2011 devices and again there are
 

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:50.370
class 2011 devices and again there are
many different characteristics we could

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:50.380
many different characteristics we could
 

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:52.200
many different characteristics we could
have looked at we looked at and we

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:52.210
have looked at we looked at and we
 

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:53.700
have looked at we looked at and we
looked at all them and we thought that

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:53.710
looked at all them and we thought that
 

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:55.590
looked at all them and we thought that
these three characteristics are the ones

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:55.600
these three characteristics are the ones
 

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:57.750
these three characteristics are the ones
that makes the most difference in terms

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:57.760
that makes the most difference in terms
 

00:02:57.760 --> 00:02:59.490
that makes the most difference in terms
of the performance of the app and how

00:02:59.490 --> 00:02:59.500
of the performance of the app and how
 

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:01.440
of the performance of the app and how
users are able to interface with the app

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:01.450
users are able to interface with the app
 

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:04.380
users are able to interface with the app
so these are the actual settings that

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:04.390
so these are the actual settings that
 

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:05.970
so these are the actual settings that
set up that we'll look at for these

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:05.980
set up that we'll look at for these
 

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:08.340
set up that we'll look at for these
three parameters and to Cuzco we

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:08.350
three parameters and to Cuzco we
 

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:09.930
three parameters and to Cuzco we
determine where the device is in one

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:09.940
determine where the device is in one
 

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:12.030
determine where the device is in one
year class or another on some devices

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:12.040
year class or another on some devices
 

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:13.410
year class or another on some devices
you know you are not going to get the

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:13.420
you know you are not going to get the
 

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:15.300
you know you are not going to get the
exact match we go for two out of three

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:15.310
exact match we go for two out of three
 

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:17.580
exact match we go for two out of three
if two out of three actually match the

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:17.590
if two out of three actually match the
 

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:19.320
if two out of three actually match the
year class we call call those devices

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:19.330
year class we call call those devices
 

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:22.500
year class we call call those devices
you know from that year class and that's

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:22.510
you know from that year class and that's
 

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:25.470
you know from that year class and that's
been a really useful metric for us it's

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:25.480
been a really useful metric for us it's
 

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:26.850
been a really useful metric for us it's
been useful for us because all of a

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:26.860
been useful for us because all of a
 

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:28.440
been useful for us because all of a

might have turn of the mobile data or

00:06:58.500 --> 00:06:58.510
might have turn of the mobile data or
 

00:06:58.510 --> 00:07:00.630

all of these are reasons for not having
any connections at all so that's simple

00:07:09.270 --> 00:07:09.280
any connections at all so that's simple
 

00:07:09.280 --> 00:07:11.610
any connections at all so that's simple
enough but when you break it down by

00:07:13.810 --> 00:07:15.840
countries you'll see that you know
there's a wide variety of different

00:07:15.840 --> 00:07:15.850
there's a wide variety of different
 

00:07:15.850 --> 00:07:17.520
there's a wide variety of different
conditions even if you look just at

00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:17.530
conditions even if you look just at
 

00:07:17.530 --> 00:07:19.470
conditions even if you look just at
those free you know why 50 and no

00:07:19.470 --> 00:07:19.480
those free you know why 50 and no
 

00:07:19.480 --> 00:07:21.720
those free you know why 50 and no
connection whatsoever you know these

00:07:21.720 --> 00:07:21.730
connection whatsoever you know these
 

00:07:21.730 --> 00:07:25.140
connection whatsoever you know these
profiles vary a lot but it actually is

00:07:25.140 --> 00:07:25.150
profiles vary a lot but it actually is
 

00:07:25.150 --> 00:07:26.670
profiles vary a lot but it actually is
even more complicated with that than

00:07:26.670 --> 00:07:26.680
even more complicated with that than
 

00:07:26.680 --> 00:07:28.530
even more complicated with that than
that I think probably everybody notice

00:07:28.530 --> 00:07:28.540
that I think probably everybody notice
 

00:07:28.540 --> 00:07:30.510
that I think probably everybody notice
is that no Wi-Fi 1 by Phi is not like

00:07:30.510 --> 00:07:30.520
is that no Wi-Fi 1 by Phi is not like
 

00:07:30.520 --> 00:07:32.580
is that no Wi-Fi 1 by Phi is not like
another Wi-Fi and you know one sailor

00:07:32.580 --> 00:07:32.590
another Wi-Fi and you know one sailor
 

00:07:32.590 --> 00:07:33.750
another Wi-Fi and you know one sailor
connection is not like another sailor

00:07:33.750 --> 00:07:33.760
connection is not like another sailor
 

00:07:33.760 --> 00:07:36.300
connection is not like another sailor
connection and so we took the page out

00:07:36.300 --> 00:07:36.310
connection and so we took the page out
 

00:07:36.310 --> 00:07:37.740
connection and so we took the page out
of device year classwork and without

00:07:37.740 --> 00:07:37.750
of device year classwork and without
 

00:07:37.750 --> 00:07:39.300

Hague could we actually do something

00:07:39.300 --> 00:07:39.310
Hague could we actually do something
 

00:07:39.310 --> 00:07:41.430
Hague could we actually do something
similar for network connections could we

00:07:41.430 --> 00:07:41.440
similar for network connections could we
 

00:07:41.440 --> 00:07:43.680
similar for network connections could we
actually a break it down and too easy to

00:07:43.680 --> 00:07:43.690
actually a break it down and too easy to
 

00:07:43.690 --> 00:07:45.870
actually a break it down and too easy to
understand classifications that you know

00:07:45.870 --> 00:07:45.880
understand classifications that you know
 

00:07:45.880 --> 00:07:48.510
understand classifications that you know
we can then use to reason about them and

00:07:48.510 --> 00:07:48.520
we can then use to reason about them and
 

00:07:48.520 --> 00:07:50.370
we can then use to reason about them and
to make improvements for different

00:07:50.370 --> 00:07:50.380
to make improvements for different
 

00:07:50.380 --> 00:07:52.320
to make improvements for different
network connections in the idea we came

00:07:52.320 --> 00:07:52.330
network connections in the idea we came
 

00:07:52.330 --> 00:07:54.810
network connections in the idea we came
up with is a network connection class

00:07:54.810 --> 00:07:54.820
up with is a network connection class
 

00:07:54.820 --> 00:07:56.100
up with is a network connection class
and again this is something we open

00:07:56.100 --> 00:07:56.110
and again this is something we open
 

00:07:56.110 --> 00:07:58.500
and again this is something we open
source and others can use as well but in

00:07:58.500 --> 00:07:58.510
source and others can use as well but in
 

00:07:58.510 --> 00:07:59.940
source and others can use as well but in
general this is fairly straightforward

00:07:59.940 --> 00:07:59.950
general this is fairly straightforward
 

00:07:59.950 --> 00:08:01.800
general this is fairly straightforward
we are doing a passive measurements or

00:08:01.800 --> 00:08:01.810
we are doing a passive measurements or
 

00:08:01.810 --> 00:08:04.620
we are doing a passive measurements or
the bandwidth like as the app sends the

00:08:04.620 --> 00:08:04.630
the bandwidth like as the app sends the
 

00:08:04.630 --> 00:08:06.870
the bandwidth like as the app sends the
packets and receives them we keep track

00:08:06.870 --> 00:08:06.880
packets and receives them we keep track
 

00:08:06.880 --> 00:08:07.980
packets and receives them we keep track
of how long it takes

00:08:07.980 --> 00:08:07.990
of how long it takes
 

00:08:07.990 --> 00:08:09.450
of how long it takes
and we measure bandwidth we throw out

00:08:09.450 --> 00:08:09.460
and we measure bandwidth we throw out
 

00:08:09.460 --> 00:08:11.190
and we measure bandwidth we throw out
small packets because the overhead is

00:08:11.190 --> 00:08:11.200
small packets because the overhead is
 

00:08:11.200 --> 00:08:13.440
small packets because the overhead is
actually you know starts dominating and

00:08:13.440 --> 00:08:13.450
actually you know starts dominating and
 

00:08:13.450 --> 00:08:15.060
actually you know starts dominating and
we only look for something which is more

00:08:15.060 --> 00:08:15.070
we only look for something which is more
 

00:08:15.070 --> 00:08:16.590
we only look for something which is more
than a certain sort of certain size and

00:08:16.590 --> 00:08:16.600
than a certain sort of certain size and
 

00:08:16.600 --> 00:08:18.570
than a certain sort of certain size and
then we get this data points we get

00:08:18.570 --> 00:08:18.580
then we get this data points we get
 

00:08:18.580 --> 00:08:19.770
then we get this data points we get
those data points all over the place you

00:08:19.770 --> 00:08:19.780
those data points all over the place you
 

00:08:19.780 --> 00:08:21.510
those data points all over the place you
know the mobile connections are you know

00:08:21.510 --> 00:08:21.520
know the mobile connections are you know
 

00:08:21.520 --> 00:08:24.060
know the mobile connections are you know
sort of notoriously you know unreliable

00:08:24.060 --> 00:08:24.070
sort of notoriously you know unreliable
 

00:08:24.070 --> 00:08:26.970
sort of notoriously you know unreliable
and then you given time you can be you

00:08:26.970 --> 00:08:26.980
and then you given time you can be you
 

00:08:26.980 --> 00:08:28.050
and then you given time you can be you
can have a really good connection on a

00:08:28.050 --> 00:08:28.060
can have a really good connection on a
 

00:08:28.060 --> 00:08:29.220
can have a really good connection on a
really bad connection especially if

00:08:29.220 --> 00:08:29.230
really bad connection especially if
 

00:08:29.230 --> 00:08:31.380
really bad connection especially if
you're moving around so we're average so

00:08:31.380 --> 00:08:31.390
you're moving around so we're average so
 

00:08:31.390 --> 00:08:32.220
you're moving around so we're average so
we looked at different methods of

00:08:32.220 --> 00:08:32.230
we looked at different methods of
 

00:08:32.230 --> 00:08:33.720
we looked at different methods of
averaging and we'll end it with a

00:08:33.720 --> 00:08:33.730
averaging and we'll end it with a
 

00:08:33.730 --> 00:08:36.600
averaging and we'll end it with a
geometric averaging so essentially we

00:08:36.600 --> 00:08:36.610
geometric averaging so essentially we
 

00:08:36.610 --> 00:08:38.250
geometric averaging so essentially we
break the space of all the bandwidth

00:08:38.250 --> 00:08:38.260
break the space of all the bandwidth
 

00:08:38.260 --> 00:08:39.870
break the space of all the bandwidth
into two categories they were all about

00:08:39.870 --> 00:08:39.880
into two categories they were all about
 

00:08:39.880 --> 00:08:42.150
into two categories they were all about
4x from each other moderate and poor

00:08:42.150 --> 00:08:42.160
4x from each other moderate and poor
 

00:08:42.160 --> 00:08:44.070
4x from each other moderate and poor
connections at the lowest ones and then

00:08:44.070 --> 00:08:44.080
connections at the lowest ones and then
 

00:08:44.080 --> 00:08:50.040
connections at the lowest ones and then
good and excellent and then you know we

00:08:50.040 --> 00:08:50.050
good and excellent and then you know we
 

00:08:50.050 --> 00:08:52.920
good and excellent and then you know we
label them again we do to label them and

00:08:52.920 --> 00:08:52.930
label them again we do to label them and
 

00:08:52.930 --> 00:08:54.240
label them again we do to label them and
understand those boundaries we look at

00:08:54.240 --> 00:08:54.250
understand those boundaries we look at
 

00:08:54.250 --> 00:08:55.560
understand those boundaries we look at
the data again we wanted to find the

00:08:55.560 --> 00:08:55.570
the data again we wanted to find the
 

00:08:55.570 --> 00:08:57.150
the data again we wanted to find the
boundaries which are actually meaningful

00:08:57.150 --> 00:08:57.160
boundaries which are actually meaningful
 

00:08:57.160 --> 00:08:59.400
boundaries which are actually meaningful
so the user moves from one connection

00:08:59.400 --> 00:08:59.410
so the user moves from one connection
 

00:08:59.410 --> 00:09:01.170
so the user moves from one connection
class to another it results in a

00:09:01.170 --> 00:09:01.180
class to another it results in a
 

00:09:01.180 --> 00:09:02.580
class to another it results in a
meaningful change to you know

00:09:02.580 --> 00:09:02.590
meaningful change to you know
 

00:09:02.590 --> 00:09:04.680
meaningful change to you know
performance or meaningful change and how

00:09:04.680 --> 00:09:04.690
performance or meaningful change and how
 

00:09:04.690 --> 00:09:05.970
performance or meaningful change and how
the user can actually interact with the

00:09:05.970 --> 00:09:05.980
the user can actually interact with the
 

00:09:05.980 --> 00:09:07.860
the user can actually interact with the
apps so this is the one we came up with

00:09:07.860 --> 00:09:07.870
apps so this is the one we came up with
 

00:09:07.870 --> 00:09:10.080
apps so this is the one we came up with
you know for the open source library we

00:09:10.080 --> 00:09:10.090
you know for the open source library we
 

00:09:10.090 --> 00:09:11.940
you know for the open source library we
just you know label them with warm water

00:09:11.940 --> 00:09:11.950
just you know label them with warm water
 

00:09:11.950 --> 00:09:13.440
just you know label them with warm water
good and excellent because in the future

00:09:13.440 --> 00:09:13.450
good and excellent because in the future
 

00:09:13.450 --> 00:09:14.640
good and excellent because in the future
we might actually change what the

00:09:14.640 --> 00:09:14.650
we might actually change what the
 

00:09:14.650 --> 00:09:16.320
we might actually change what the
boundaries are but we found that this

00:09:16.320 --> 00:09:16.330
boundaries are but we found that this
 

00:09:16.330 --> 00:09:17.670
boundaries are but we found that this
for I could just great groups for

their up towards okay so like Alex

00:09:27.570 --> 00:09:27.580
their up towards okay so like Alex
 

00:09:27.580 --> 00:09:30.540
their up towards okay so like Alex
mentioned we found this technology does

00:09:30.540 --> 00:09:30.550
mentioned we found this technology does
 

00:09:30.550 --> 00:09:32.940
mentioned we found this technology does
not imply speed and this is pretty

00:09:32.940 --> 00:09:32.950
not imply speed and this is pretty
 

00:09:32.950 --> 00:09:34.170
not imply speed and this is pretty
apparent to anyone that's actually

00:09:34.170 --> 00:09:34.180
apparent to anyone that's actually

something like that just because you're

00:09:40.140 --> 00:09:40.150
something like that just because you're
 

00:09:40.150 --> 00:09:43.110
something like that just because you're
on Wi-Fi does not mean that you're on a

on Wi-Fi does not mean that you're on a
 

00:09:43.120 --> 00:09:45.420
on Wi-Fi does not mean that you're on a
good fast connection so when you're

00:09:45.420 --> 00:09:45.430
good fast connection so when you're
 

00:09:45.430 --> 00:09:47.040

you can't just use that you're on Wi-Fi
 

00:09:55.330 --> 00:09:57.120
you can't just use that you're on Wi-Fi
or not on Wi-Fi because that doesn't

example in India and in the United

00:10:10.980 --> 00:10:10.990
example in India and in the United
 

00:10:10.990 --> 00:10:13.470
example in India and in the United
States the same download can take four

00:10:13.470 --> 00:10:13.480
States the same download can take four
 

00:10:13.480 --> 00:10:15.570
States the same download can take four
times longer or be four times faster in

00:10:15.570 --> 00:10:15.580
times longer or be four times faster in
 

00:10:15.580 --> 00:10:17.550
times longer or be four times faster in
the United States on average than in

the United States on average than in
 

00:10:17.560 --> 00:10:20.790
the United States on average than in
India for the same connection type so

00:10:20.790 --> 00:10:20.800
India for the same connection type so

hey if I think about Japan do I think
about bad connections that I think about

about bad connections that I think about
 

00:11:11.680 --> 00:11:12.930
about bad connections that I think about
good connections I think just everybody

are wondering why the title kind of

00:11:32.070 --> 00:11:32.080
are wondering why the title kind of
 

00:11:32.080 --> 00:11:34.230
are wondering why the title kind of

title of the slide what we think is

00:11:36.090 --> 00:11:36.100
title of the slide what we think is
 

00:11:36.100 --> 00:11:37.680
title of the slide what we think is
happening is that basically users are

00:11:37.680 --> 00:11:37.690
happening is that basically users are
 

00:11:37.690 --> 00:11:39.480
happening is that basically users are

you are just looking at the country or
the type of the connection Wi-Fi or

the type of the connection Wi-Fi or
 

00:11:46.840 --> 00:11:48.690
the type of the connection Wi-Fi or

some group of the population which

00:11:50.100 --> 00:11:50.110
some group of the population which
 

00:11:50.110 --> 00:11:53.390
some group of the population which
actually doesn't quite fit the profile

00:11:53.390 --> 00:11:53.400
actually doesn't quite fit the profile

actually doesn't quite fit the profile
so you guys have seen this slide a few

00:11:56.250 --> 00:11:56.260
so you guys have seen this slide a few
 

00:11:56.260 --> 00:11:59.340
so you guys have seen this slide a few
slides ago and we talked about the

00:11:59.340 --> 00:11:59.350
slides ago and we talked about the
 

00:11:59.350 --> 00:12:01.260
slides ago and we talked about the
different breakdowns and what I'd like

00:12:01.260 --> 00:12:01.270
different breakdowns and what I'd like
 

00:12:01.270 --> 00:12:03.270
different breakdowns and what I'd like
to point out is now the intermittency

00:12:03.270 --> 00:12:03.280
to point out is now the intermittency
 

00:12:03.280 --> 00:12:06.870
to point out is now the intermittency
issue is that there's a certain time no

00:12:06.870 --> 00:12:06.880
issue is that there's a certain time no
 

00:12:06.880 --> 00:12:09.020
issue is that there's a certain time no
matter what country you're in the matter

00:12:09.020 --> 00:12:09.030
matter what country you're in the matter
 

00:12:09.030 --> 00:12:11.670
matter what country you're in the matter
what network you're on where you turn on

00:12:11.670 --> 00:12:11.680
what network you're on where you turn on
 

00:12:11.680 --> 00:12:13.050
what network you're on where you turn on
your app and for some reason you don't

00:12:13.050 --> 00:12:13.060
your app and for some reason you don't
 

00:12:13.060 --> 00:12:15.300
your app and for some reason you don't
have a network right now this is

00:12:15.300 --> 00:12:15.310
have a network right now this is
 

00:12:15.310 --> 00:12:16.950
have a network right now this is
obviously a much bigger problems in

00:12:16.950 --> 00:12:16.960
obviously a much bigger problems in
 

00:12:16.960 --> 00:12:18.390
obviously a much bigger problems in
places like India and Nigeria where

00:12:18.390 --> 00:12:18.400
places like India and Nigeria where
 

00:12:18.400 --> 00:12:20.370
places like India and Nigeria where
something like twenty percent of all app

00:12:20.370 --> 00:12:20.380
something like twenty percent of all app
 

00:12:20.380 --> 00:12:22.980
something like twenty percent of all app
startups do not have any network at all

00:12:22.980 --> 00:12:22.990
startups do not have any network at all
 

00:12:22.990 --> 00:12:25.260
startups do not have any network at all
but still even the United States we've

00:12:25.260 --> 00:12:25.270
but still even the United States we've
 

00:12:25.270 --> 00:12:27.300
but still even the United States we've
all been on the subway on the bus or

00:12:27.300 --> 00:12:27.310
all been on the subway on the bus or
 

00:12:27.310 --> 00:12:28.830
all been on the subway on the bus or
something like that where there's no

00:12:28.830 --> 00:12:28.840
something like that where there's no
 

00:12:28.840 --> 00:12:32.340
something like that where there's no
connection right now and even though you

00:12:32.340 --> 00:12:32.350
connection right now and even though you
 

00:12:32.350 --> 00:12:33.580
connection right now and even though you
have a

00:12:33.580 --> 00:12:33.590
have a
 

00:12:33.590 --> 00:12:35.350
have a
network connection or Android will tell

00:12:35.350 --> 00:12:35.360
network connection or Android will tell
 

00:12:35.360 --> 00:12:36.970
network connection or Android will tell
you you have a network connection we

00:12:36.970 --> 00:12:36.980
you you have a network connection we
 

00:12:36.980 --> 00:12:40.990
you you have a network connection we
found is packets will go out and then

00:12:40.990 --> 00:12:41.000
found is packets will go out and then
 

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:42.790
found is packets will go out and then
they'll just essentially just go into a

00:12:42.790 --> 00:12:42.800
they'll just essentially just go into a
 

00:12:42.800 --> 00:12:44.620
they'll just essentially just go into a
black hole somewhere and then never come

00:12:44.620 --> 00:12:44.630
black hole somewhere and then never come
 

00:12:44.630 --> 00:12:46.960
black hole somewhere and then never come
back nothing comes back so about what we

00:12:46.960 --> 00:12:46.970
back nothing comes back so about what we
 

00:12:46.970 --> 00:12:48.940
back nothing comes back so about what we
found is like twenty percent of all

00:12:48.940 --> 00:12:48.950
found is like twenty percent of all
 

00:12:48.950 --> 00:12:51.430
found is like twenty percent of all
network requests fail and this is why

00:12:51.430 --> 00:12:51.440
network requests fail and this is why
 

00:12:51.440 --> 00:12:52.870
network requests fail and this is why
the app is in the foreground so we know

00:12:52.870 --> 00:12:52.880
the app is in the foreground so we know
 

00:12:52.880 --> 00:12:54.280
the app is in the foreground so we know
that the user is trying to use the app

00:12:54.280 --> 00:12:54.290
that the user is trying to use the app
 

00:12:54.290 --> 00:12:56.230
that the user is trying to use the app
while the app is in the background it

00:12:56.230 --> 00:12:56.240
while the app is in the background it
 

00:12:56.240 --> 00:12:59.110
while the app is in the background it
could be fifty sixty percent if you're

00:12:59.110 --> 00:12:59.120
could be fifty sixty percent if you're
 

00:12:59.120 --> 00:13:00.490
could be fifty sixty percent if you're
trying to make a network request while

00:13:00.490 --> 00:13:00.500
trying to make a network request while
 

00:13:00.500 --> 00:13:05.260
trying to make a network request while
it's in the background so in addition to

00:13:05.260 --> 00:13:05.270
it's in the background so in addition to
 

00:13:05.270 --> 00:13:06.700
it's in the background so in addition to
that I've been we believe that the

00:13:06.700 --> 00:13:06.710
that I've been we believe that the
 

00:13:06.710 --> 00:13:07.600
that I've been we believe that the
improvements especially in the

00:13:07.600 --> 00:13:07.610
improvements especially in the
 

00:13:07.610 --> 00:13:08.740
improvements especially in the
networking side are going to take some

00:13:08.740 --> 00:13:08.750
networking side are going to take some
 

00:13:08.750 --> 00:13:11.800
networking side are going to take some
time so 2g is being phased out on us

00:13:11.800 --> 00:13:11.810
time so 2g is being phased out on us
 

00:13:11.810 --> 00:13:13.570
time so 2g is being phased out on us
which is great news but it's going to be

00:13:13.570 --> 00:13:13.580
which is great news but it's going to be
 

00:13:13.580 --> 00:13:15.520
which is great news but it's going to be
around in the developing in the emerging

00:13:15.520 --> 00:13:15.530
around in the developing in the emerging
 

00:13:15.530 --> 00:13:17.470
around in the developing in the emerging
market places for a while you know at

00:13:17.470 --> 00:13:17.480
market places for a while you know at
 

00:13:17.480 --> 00:13:19.180
market places for a while you know at
least for a few years but that's not

00:13:19.180 --> 00:13:19.190
least for a few years but that's not
 

00:13:19.190 --> 00:13:20.860
least for a few years but that's not
even the whole problem the bigger

00:13:20.860 --> 00:13:20.870
even the whole problem the bigger
 

00:13:20.870 --> 00:13:23.080
even the whole problem the bigger
problem is the congestion because if you

00:13:23.080 --> 00:13:23.090
problem is the congestion because if you
 

00:13:23.090 --> 00:13:24.190
problem is the congestion because if you
go to the merge marketplace and you're

00:13:24.190 --> 00:13:24.200
go to the merge marketplace and you're
 

00:13:24.200 --> 00:13:25.750
go to the merge marketplace and you're
and you try the free G over there what

00:13:25.750 --> 00:13:25.760
and you try the free G over there what
 

00:13:25.760 --> 00:13:27.610
and you try the free G over there what
about you often find that 3g is not like

00:13:27.610 --> 00:13:27.620
about you often find that 3g is not like
 

00:13:27.620 --> 00:13:30.370
about you often find that 3g is not like
a 3g here and the reason is it's it's

00:13:30.370 --> 00:13:30.380
a 3g here and the reason is it's it's
 

00:13:30.380 --> 00:13:32.010
a 3g here and the reason is it's it's
really congested and it's not reliable

00:13:32.010 --> 00:13:32.020
really congested and it's not reliable
 

00:13:32.020 --> 00:13:35.410
really congested and it's not reliable
and you know congestion comes from a lot

00:13:35.410 --> 00:13:35.420
and you know congestion comes from a lot
 

00:13:35.420 --> 00:13:37.960
and you know congestion comes from a lot
of people using the networks and you

00:13:37.960 --> 00:13:37.970
of people using the networks and you
 

00:13:37.970 --> 00:13:38.830
of people using the networks and you
know more and more people are getting

00:13:38.830 --> 00:13:38.840
know more and more people are getting
 

00:13:38.840 --> 00:13:40.750
know more and more people are getting
online more and more people are using

00:13:40.750 --> 00:13:40.760
online more and more people are using
 

00:13:40.760 --> 00:13:42.070

what are guys going to do about this I
 

00:15:10.329 --> 00:15:11.550
what are guys going to do about this I
said well put a new cell tower in the

00:15:11.550 --> 00:15:11.560
said well put a new cell tower in the
 

00:15:11.560 --> 00:15:12.870
said well put a new cell tower in the
area but it takes about six to nine

00:15:12.870 --> 00:15:12.880
area but it takes about six to nine
 

00:15:12.880 --> 00:15:14.100
area but it takes about six to nine
months to put a new cell tower in the

00:15:14.100 --> 00:15:14.110
months to put a new cell tower in the
 

00:15:14.110 --> 00:15:16.050
months to put a new cell tower in the
area and so in the meantime that's what

00:15:16.050 --> 00:15:16.060
area and so in the meantime that's what
 

00:15:16.060 --> 00:15:17.759
area and so in the meantime that's what
you're going to get so that was actually

interesting anecdote about this if you

00:16:10.290 --> 00:16:10.300
interesting anecdote about this if you
 

00:16:10.300 --> 00:16:12.090
interesting anecdote about this if you
if you go to rural area in J as long as

00:16:12.090 --> 00:16:12.100
if you go to rural area in J as long as
 

00:16:12.100 --> 00:16:13.800
if you go to rural area in J as long as
you stay to a major highway when you

00:16:13.800 --> 00:16:13.810
you stay to a major highway when you
 

00:16:13.810 --> 00:16:15.240
you stay to a major highway when you
leave a large CD your connection

00:16:15.240 --> 00:16:15.250
leave a large CD your connection
 

00:16:15.250 --> 00:16:16.860
leave a large CD your connection
improves because you know along the

00:16:16.860 --> 00:16:16.870
improves because you know along the
 

00:16:16.870 --> 00:16:18.210
improves because you know along the
major highways your connectivity is

00:16:18.210 --> 00:16:18.220
major highways your connectivity is
 

00:16:18.220 --> 00:16:19.710
major highways your connectivity is
actually pretty decent and congestion

00:16:19.710 --> 00:16:19.720
actually pretty decent and congestion
 

00:16:19.720 --> 00:16:22.079
actually pretty decent and congestion
start getting less and less so like just

00:16:22.079 --> 00:16:22.089
start getting less and less so like just
 

00:16:22.089 --> 00:16:23.490
start getting less and less so like just
outside of the cities as long as you

00:16:23.490 --> 00:16:23.500
outside of the cities as long as you
 

00:16:23.500 --> 00:16:24.660
outside of the cities as long as you
stick to the major highway you actually

00:16:24.660 --> 00:16:24.670
stick to the major highway you actually
 

00:16:24.670 --> 00:16:30.019
stick to the major highway you actually
have really good connectivity so this is

00:16:30.019 --> 00:16:30.029
have really good connectivity so this is
 

00:16:30.029 --> 00:16:33.240
have really good connectivity so this is

emerging problem emerging markets
 

00:16:35.649 --> 00:16:39.600
emerging problem emerging markets
however the more we looked at this the

00:16:39.600 --> 00:16:39.610
however the more we looked at this the
 

00:16:39.610 --> 00:16:41.280
however the more we looked at this the
more we realize this is not really just

00:16:41.280 --> 00:16:41.290
more we realize this is not really just
 

00:16:41.290 --> 00:16:43.499
more we realize this is not really just
an emerging markets problem this is

00:16:43.499 --> 00:16:43.509
an emerging markets problem this is
 

00:16:43.509 --> 00:16:45.990
an emerging markets problem this is
really a subway problem this is a

00:16:45.990 --> 00:16:46.000
really a subway problem this is a
 

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:48.360
really a subway problem this is a
crowded Stadium problem it's a crowded

00:16:48.360 --> 00:16:48.370
crowded Stadium problem it's a crowded
 

00:16:48.370 --> 00:16:49.889
crowded Stadium problem it's a crowded
conference problem this is a road trip

00:16:49.889 --> 00:16:49.899
conference problem this is a road trip
 

00:16:49.899 --> 00:16:52.829
conference problem this is a road trip
problem this is an airplane problem or

00:16:52.829 --> 00:16:52.839
problem this is an airplane problem or
 

00:16:52.839 --> 00:16:54.569
problem this is an airplane problem or
if you're in new york city or somewhere

00:16:54.569 --> 00:16:54.579
if you're in new york city or somewhere
 

00:16:54.579 --> 00:16:57.540
if you're in new york city or somewhere
around it's your bad reception in your

00:16:57.540 --> 00:16:57.550
around it's your bad reception in your
 

00:16:57.550 --> 00:17:00.500
around it's your bad reception in your
house so all of these

00:17:00.500 --> 00:17:00.510
house so all of these
 

00:17:00.510 --> 00:17:04.319
house so all of these
it's is it s injury issues boil down to

00:17:04.319 --> 00:17:04.329
it's is it s injury issues boil down to
 

00:17:04.329 --> 00:17:06.199
it's is it s injury issues boil down to
like when you're building mobile apps

00:17:06.199 --> 00:17:06.209
like when you're building mobile apps
 

00:17:06.209 --> 00:17:08.880
like when you're building mobile apps
the network is your enemy it doesn't

00:17:08.880 --> 00:17:08.890
the network is your enemy it doesn't
 

00:17:08.890 --> 00:17:11.309
the network is your enemy it doesn't
really matter how good your phone is if

00:17:11.309 --> 00:17:11.319
really matter how good your phone is if
 

00:17:11.319 --> 00:17:14.130
really matter how good your phone is if
you're on a bad network or you happen to

00:17:14.130 --> 00:17:14.140
you're on a bad network or you happen to
 

00:17:14.140 --> 00:17:15.930
you're on a bad network or you happen to
be in a situation Rio and a bad network

00:17:15.930 --> 00:17:15.940
be in a situation Rio and a bad network
 

00:17:15.940 --> 00:17:18.930
be in a situation Rio and a bad network
right now your experience your users

00:17:18.930 --> 00:17:18.940
right now your experience your users
 

00:17:18.940 --> 00:17:20.280
right now your experience your users
experience r is going to be pretty

00:17:20.280 --> 00:17:20.290
experience r is going to be pretty
 

00:17:20.290 --> 00:17:25.710
experience r is going to be pretty
terrible so when we think about how we

00:17:25.710 --> 00:17:25.720
terrible so when we think about how we
 

00:17:25.720 --> 00:17:26.970
terrible so when we think about how we
address this issue especially for the

00:17:26.970 --> 00:17:26.980
address this issue especially for the
 

00:17:26.980 --> 00:17:28.230
address this issue especially for the
network issue we kind of break it down

00:17:28.230 --> 00:17:28.240
network issue we kind of break it down
 

00:17:28.240 --> 00:17:30.180
network issue we kind of break it down
into different classes what are the

00:17:30.180 --> 00:17:30.190
into different classes what are the
 

00:17:30.190 --> 00:17:31.440
into different classes what are the
strategies for modern phones you know

00:17:31.440 --> 00:17:31.450
strategies for modern phones you know
 

00:17:31.450 --> 00:17:34.020
strategies for modern phones you know
phone is it's not a limitation it's not

00:17:34.020 --> 00:17:34.030
phone is it's not a limitation it's not
 

00:17:34.030 --> 00:17:36.060
phone is it's not a limitation it's not
a constraint but network is like how do

00:17:36.060 --> 00:17:36.070
a constraint but network is like how do
 

00:17:36.070 --> 00:17:37.950
a constraint but network is like how do
we deal with that and the other one is a

00:17:37.950 --> 00:17:37.960
we deal with that and the other one is a
 

00:17:37.960 --> 00:17:39.420
we deal with that and the other one is a
situation where your phone is actually a

00:17:39.420 --> 00:17:39.430
situation where your phone is actually a
 

00:17:39.430 --> 00:17:40.920
situation where your phone is actually a
limitation so we're going to start

00:17:40.920 --> 00:17:40.930
limitation so we're going to start
 

00:17:40.930 --> 00:17:42.360
limitation so we're going to start
talking about the strategist for modern

00:17:42.360 --> 00:17:42.370
talking about the strategist for modern
 

00:17:42.370 --> 00:17:44.370
talking about the strategist for modern
phone first so phones that actually have

00:17:44.370 --> 00:17:44.380
phone first so phones that actually have
 

00:17:44.380 --> 00:17:47.300
phone first so phones that actually have
storage for sat have pretty good cpu

00:17:47.300 --> 00:17:47.310
storage for sat have pretty good cpu
 

00:17:47.310 --> 00:17:49.530
storage for sat have pretty good cpu
influence it generally look like you

00:17:49.530 --> 00:17:49.540
influence it generally look like you
 

00:17:49.540 --> 00:17:51.600
influence it generally look like you
know this computers you know the desktop

00:17:51.600 --> 00:17:51.610
know this computers you know the desktop
 

00:17:51.610 --> 00:17:53.160
know this computers you know the desktop
computers or five years ago even better

00:17:53.160 --> 00:17:53.170
computers or five years ago even better
 

00:17:53.170 --> 00:17:55.950
computers or five years ago even better
than that so the easiest thing you can

00:17:55.950 --> 00:17:55.960
than that so the easiest thing you can
 

00:17:55.960 --> 00:17:58.800
than that so the easiest thing you can
do is cache the data that you download

00:17:58.800 --> 00:17:58.810
do is cache the data that you download
 

00:17:58.810 --> 00:18:02.490
do is cache the data that you download
so this is very important when you're

00:18:02.490 --> 00:18:02.500
so this is very important when you're
 

00:18:02.500 --> 00:18:04.140
so this is very important when you're
trying to especially for images and a

00:18:04.140 --> 00:18:04.150
trying to especially for images and a
 

00:18:04.150 --> 00:18:06.810
trying to especially for images and a
lot of things that take a lot of bites

00:18:06.810 --> 00:18:06.820
lot of things that take a lot of bites
 

00:18:06.820 --> 00:18:08.820
lot of things that take a lot of bites
over the wire but it's also important

00:18:08.820 --> 00:18:08.830
over the wire but it's also important
 

00:18:08.830 --> 00:18:10.740
over the wire but it's also important
for just simple responses like from your

00:18:10.740 --> 00:18:10.750
for just simple responses like from your
 

00:18:10.750 --> 00:18:13.350
for just simple responses like from your
servers for like metadata and things

00:18:13.350 --> 00:18:13.360
servers for like metadata and things
 

00:18:13.360 --> 00:18:15.600
servers for like metadata and things
like that and the reason this is because

00:18:15.600 --> 00:18:15.610
like that and the reason this is because
 

00:18:15.610 --> 00:18:17.310
like that and the reason this is because
you the user might wake up the app and

wait look for a spinner and then use the
threads especially like for example

00:19:36.750 --> 00:19:36.760

things like view inflation is very

00:19:38.670 --> 00:19:38.680
things like view inflation is very
 

00:19:38.680 --> 00:19:40.320
things like view inflation is very
expensive right it takes a while

do that so next use the network cleverly
so we talked about caching if you have a

00:26:45.570 --> 00:26:45.580
comments I don't look at them and so the
 

00:26:45.580 --> 00:26:46.830
comments I don't look at them and so the
problem is like how do you make it

00:26:46.830 --> 00:26:46.840
problem is like how do you make it
 

00:26:46.840 --> 00:26:49.169
problem is like how do you make it
efficient that's a great scenario for

00:26:49.169 --> 00:26:49.179
efficient that's a great scenario for
 

00:26:49.179 --> 00:26:50.610

like a more probabilistic approach so

00:26:50.610 --> 00:26:50.620
like a more probabilistic approach so
 

00:26:50.620 --> 00:26:51.660
like a more probabilistic approach so
it's right we're going to try to guess

00:26:51.660 --> 00:26:51.670
it's right we're going to try to guess
 

00:26:51.670 --> 00:26:54.090
it's right we're going to try to guess
whether you can actually going to read

00:26:54.090 --> 00:26:54.100
whether you can actually going to read
 

00:26:54.100 --> 00:26:56.250
whether you can actually going to read
this commented out in some cases is

00:26:56.250 --> 00:26:56.260
this commented out in some cases is
 

00:26:56.260 --> 00:26:57.930
this commented out in some cases is
fairly easy because occasionally we show

00:26:57.930 --> 00:26:57.940
fairly easy because occasionally we show
 

00:26:57.940 --> 00:27:00.060
fairly easy because occasionally we show
you story you've seen before but it's

00:27:00.060 --> 00:27:00.070
you story you've seen before but it's
 

00:27:00.070 --> 00:27:01.799
you story you've seen before but it's
got more comments and more likes in

00:27:01.799 --> 00:27:01.809
got more comments and more likes in
 

00:27:01.809 --> 00:27:02.970
got more comments and more likes in
which case we're already showing you the

00:27:02.970 --> 00:27:02.980
which case we're already showing you the
 

00:27:02.980 --> 00:27:04.290
which case we're already showing you the
story because it's got more comments so

00:27:04.290 --> 00:27:04.300
story because it's got more comments so
 

00:27:04.300 --> 00:27:06.419

a little bit trickier I mean there are

00:27:07.560 --> 00:27:07.570
a little bit trickier I mean there are
 

00:27:07.570 --> 00:27:08.790
a little bit trickier I mean there are
different parameters that we take into

00:27:08.790 --> 00:27:08.800
different parameters that we take into
 

00:27:08.800 --> 00:27:11.220
different parameters that we take into
consideration and we actually have a

00:27:11.220 --> 00:27:11.230
consideration and we actually have a
 

00:27:11.230 --> 00:27:12.900
consideration and we actually have a
system on the server that does machine

how likely are you to actually look at
the comment and not and then the server

the comment and not and then the server
 

00:27:17.050 --> 00:27:18.990
the comment and not and then the server
sends this probability back to the

sends this probability back to the
 

00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:20.160
sends this probability back to the
client and the client can look at that

00:27:20.160 --> 00:27:20.170
client and the client can look at that
 

00:27:20.170 --> 00:27:22.200

conditions you're under so that's an
 

00:27:27.340 --> 00:27:28.740

example of cal probabilistic prefetching
 

00:27:28.750 --> 00:27:31.230
example of cal probabilistic prefetching
works very well that also means that

00:27:31.230 --> 00:27:31.240

know you click on the comment will take
 

00:27:35.920 --> 00:27:38.610
know you click on the comment will take
some time but you know we are generally

some time but you know we are generally
 

00:27:38.620 --> 00:27:39.900
some time but you know we are generally
pretty good about this and so most of

00:27:39.900 --> 00:27:39.910
pretty good about this and so most of
 

00:27:39.910 --> 00:27:41.010
pretty good about this and so most of
the time when you actually look want to

the time when you actually look want to
 

00:27:41.020 --> 00:27:42.180
the time when you actually look want to

so essentially throttle yourself to one

00:31:09.090 --> 00:31:09.100
so essentially throttle yourself to one
 

00:31:09.100 --> 00:31:12.510
so essentially throttle yourself to one
request at a time yeah you know some

00:31:12.510 --> 00:31:12.520
request at a time yeah you know some
 

00:31:12.520 --> 00:31:13.860

things you just can't do like a low-end
devices or at least we have to figure

00:31:15.750 --> 00:31:15.760
devices or at least we have to figure
 

00:31:15.760 --> 00:31:16.920

out a way to do that for example how

00:31:16.920 --> 00:31:16.930
out a way to do that for example how
 

00:31:16.930 --> 00:31:18.150
out a way to do that for example how
would you deal with intermittency like

00:31:18.150 --> 00:31:18.160
would you deal with intermittency like
 

00:31:18.160 --> 00:31:20.160
would you deal with intermittency like
if you don't have the cash space and you

00:31:20.160 --> 00:31:20.170
if you don't have the cash space and you
 

00:31:20.170 --> 00:31:21.650
if you don't have the cash space and you
can really pretty catch ahead of time

00:31:21.650 --> 00:31:21.660
can really pretty catch ahead of time
 

00:31:21.660 --> 00:31:24.510
can really pretty catch ahead of time
pretty hard but you can you can do you

00:31:24.510 --> 00:31:24.520
pretty hard but you can you can do you
 

00:31:24.520 --> 00:31:26.550
pretty hard but you can you can do you
know fairly well with in situations

00:31:26.550 --> 00:31:26.560
know fairly well with in situations
 

00:31:26.560 --> 00:31:28.250
know fairly well with in situations
where the network is just is just slow

00:31:28.250 --> 00:31:28.260
where the network is just is just slow
 

00:31:28.260 --> 00:31:31.050
where the network is just is just slow
so the tail here is the mobile web and

00:31:31.050 --> 00:31:31.060
so the tail here is the mobile web and
 

00:31:31.060 --> 00:31:33.780
so the tail here is the mobile web and
push notifications you know the one

00:31:33.780 --> 00:31:33.790
push notifications you know the one
 

00:31:33.790 --> 00:31:34.920
push notifications you know the one
thing I want to mention about mobile web

00:31:34.920 --> 00:31:34.930
thing I want to mention about mobile web
 

00:31:34.930 --> 00:31:37.020
thing I want to mention about mobile web
is there is a misconception that you

00:31:37.020 --> 00:31:37.030
is there is a misconception that you
 

00:31:37.030 --> 00:31:39.210
is there is a misconception that you
know on Android you know mobile web is

00:31:39.210 --> 00:31:39.220
know on Android you know mobile web is
 

00:31:39.220 --> 00:31:40.800
know on Android you know mobile web is
going down in terms of numbers and the

00:31:40.800 --> 00:31:40.810
going down in terms of numbers and the
 

00:31:40.810 --> 00:31:43.230
going down in terms of numbers and the
native applications are going up and

00:31:43.230 --> 00:31:43.240
native applications are going up and
 

00:31:43.240 --> 00:31:45.120
native applications are going up and
actually what what's true is both are

00:31:45.120 --> 00:31:45.130
actually what what's true is both are
 

00:31:45.130 --> 00:31:46.890
actually what what's true is both are
going up like it's a lot of users are

00:31:46.890 --> 00:31:46.900
going up like it's a lot of users are
 

00:31:46.900 --> 00:31:49.080
going up like it's a lot of users are
switching from future phones I mean a

00:31:49.080 --> 00:31:49.090
switching from future phones I mean a
 

00:31:49.090 --> 00:31:50.550
switching from future phones I mean a
lot of them are switching to devices

00:31:50.550 --> 00:31:50.560
lot of them are switching to devices
 

00:31:50.560 --> 00:31:52.290
lot of them are switching to devices
which is just you know not powerful

00:31:52.290 --> 00:31:52.300
which is just you know not powerful
 

00:31:52.300 --> 00:31:54.870
which is just you know not powerful
enough to around some of the some of the

00:31:54.870 --> 00:31:54.880
enough to around some of the some of the
 

00:31:54.880 --> 00:31:56.070
enough to around some of the some of the
functionality we have in the main app

00:31:56.070 --> 00:31:56.080
functionality we have in the main app
 

00:31:56.080 --> 00:31:58.080
functionality we have in the main app
and you know they opted for using the

00:31:58.080 --> 00:31:58.090
and you know they opted for using the
 

00:31:58.090 --> 00:32:00.210
and you know they opted for using the
mobile web instead and you know we think

00:32:00.210 --> 00:32:00.220
mobile web instead and you know we think
 

00:32:00.220 --> 00:32:01.380
mobile web instead and you know we think
we think with for some devices is a

00:32:01.380 --> 00:32:01.390
we think with for some devices is a
 

00:32:01.390 --> 00:32:03.150
we think with for some devices is a
perfectly great solution to do that so

00:32:03.150 --> 00:32:03.160
perfectly great solution to do that so
 

00:32:03.160 --> 00:32:04.620
perfectly great solution to do that so
the usage is growing for both of us and

00:32:04.620 --> 00:32:04.630
the usage is growing for both of us and
 

00:32:04.630 --> 00:32:06.180
the usage is growing for both of us and
I think for most other apps that that's

00:32:06.180 --> 00:32:06.190
I think for most other apps that that's
 

00:32:06.190 --> 00:32:09.060
I think for most other apps that that's
true as well and push notifications is

00:32:09.060 --> 00:32:09.070
true as well and push notifications is
 

00:32:09.070 --> 00:32:10.440
true as well and push notifications is
just really exciting topic because up

00:32:10.440 --> 00:32:10.450
just really exciting topic because up
 

00:32:10.450 --> 00:32:13.050
just really exciting topic because up
until this year you know what push

00:32:13.050 --> 00:32:13.060
until this year you know what push
 

00:32:13.060 --> 00:32:14.580
until this year you know what push
notification the browser you know what

00:32:14.580 --> 00:32:14.590
notification the browser you know what
 

00:32:14.590 --> 00:32:16.830
notification the browser you know what
did that come from right and so this

00:32:16.830 --> 00:32:16.840
did that come from right and so this
 

00:32:16.840 --> 00:32:19.320
did that come from right and so this
year we actually were originally

00:32:19.320 --> 00:32:19.330
year we actually were originally
 

00:32:19.330 --> 00:32:21.420
year we actually were originally

in China and India to to provide push

00:32:26.070 --> 00:32:26.080
in China and India to to provide push
 

00:32:26.080 --> 00:32:28.440
in China and India to to provide push
notifications and you know we did that

00:32:28.440 --> 00:32:28.450
notifications and you know we did that
 

00:32:28.450 --> 00:32:29.760
notifications and you know we did that
for with you see mini and then we

00:32:29.760 --> 00:32:29.770
for with you see mini and then we

the Opera and in both cases we saw just

00:32:32.940 --> 00:32:32.950
the Opera and in both cases we saw just
 

00:32:32.950 --> 00:32:34.590
the Opera and in both cases we saw just
a tremendous response from from the

00:32:34.590 --> 00:32:34.600
a tremendous response from from the
 

00:32:34.600 --> 00:32:36.030
a tremendous response from from the
users I mean they just you know very

00:32:36.030 --> 00:32:36.040

active push notifications the great

00:32:37.110 --> 00:32:37.120
active push notifications the great
 

00:32:37.120 --> 00:32:38.400
active push notifications the great
functionality and so they visit the app

00:32:38.400 --> 00:32:38.410
functionality and so they visit the app
 

00:32:38.410 --> 00:32:40.440
functionality and so they visit the app
more often and then we work with google

00:32:40.440 --> 00:32:40.450
more often and then we work with google
 

00:32:40.450 --> 00:32:42.480
more often and then we work with google
google is very interested in building is

00:32:42.480 --> 00:32:42.490
google is very interested in building is

google is very interested in building is
a platform feature and they did that i

00:32:44.520 --> 00:32:44.530
a platform feature and they did that i
 

00:32:44.530 --> 00:32:45.750
a platform feature and they did that i
mean in chrome right now you actually

00:32:45.750 --> 00:32:45.760
mean in chrome right now you actually
 

00:32:45.760 --> 00:32:48.000
mean in chrome right now you actually
can help different apps do the same

00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:48.010
can help different apps do the same
 

00:32:48.010 --> 00:32:50.460
can help different apps do the same
thing that we did and provide push

00:32:50.460 --> 00:32:50.470
thing that we did and provide push
 

00:32:50.470 --> 00:32:51.600
thing that we did and provide push
notifications for them so they have a

00:32:51.600 --> 00:32:51.610
notifications for them so they have a
 

00:32:51.610 --> 00:32:53.010
notifications for them so they have a
platform and apps can actually do that

00:32:53.010 --> 00:32:53.020
platform and apps can actually do that
 

00:32:53.020 --> 00:32:55.110
platform and apps can actually do that

00:33:16.600 --> 00:33:17.640
direction that's pretty great yeah I
mean I think we've had a lot of

00:33:17.640 --> 00:33:17.650
mean I think we've had a lot of
 

00:33:17.650 --> 00:33:19.080
mean I think we've had a lot of
materials we have about 15 minutes more

00:33:19.080 --> 00:33:19.090
materials we have about 15 minutes more
 

00:33:19.090 --> 00:33:22.230
materials we have about 15 minutes more
or over sort of more material to cover

00:33:22.230 --> 00:33:22.240
or over sort of more material to cover
 

00:33:22.240 --> 00:33:23.670
or over sort of more material to cover
but we wanted to stop and see if people

00:33:23.670 --> 00:33:23.680
but we wanted to stop and see if people
 

00:33:23.680 --> 00:33:26.730
but we wanted to stop and see if people
have any questions before we go on about

00:33:26.730 --> 00:33:26.740
have any questions before we go on about
 

00:33:26.740 --> 00:33:29.370
have any questions before we go on about
the material we just presented if you go

00:33:29.370 --> 00:33:29.380
the material we just presented if you go
 

00:33:29.380 --> 00:33:30.390
the material we just presented if you go
have general questions they can also

00:33:30.390 --> 00:33:30.400
have general questions they can also
 

00:33:30.400 --> 00:33:35.160
have general questions they can also
come out afterwards anybody oh there's a

00:33:35.160 --> 00:33:35.170
come out afterwards anybody oh there's a
 

00:33:35.170 --> 00:33:55.900
come out afterwards anybody oh there's a
question

00:33:55.900 --> 00:33:55.910
 
 

00:33:55.910 --> 00:34:00.590
 
right right right so the question the

00:34:00.590 --> 00:34:00.600
right right right so the question the
 

00:34:00.600 --> 00:34:02.600
right right right so the question the
question is like a lot of stuff here is

00:34:02.600 --> 00:34:02.610
question is like a lot of stuff here is
 

00:34:02.610 --> 00:34:04.160
question is like a lot of stuff here is
pretty high-end you know like a mere

00:34:04.160 --> 00:34:04.170
pretty high-end you know like a mere
 

00:34:04.170 --> 00:34:06.260
pretty high-end you know like a mere

of development work for companies were

00:34:08.060 --> 00:34:08.070
of development work for companies were
 

00:34:08.070 --> 00:34:09.410
of development work for companies were
just starting to think about the mobile

00:34:09.410 --> 00:34:09.420
just starting to think about the mobile
 

00:34:09.420 --> 00:34:11.750
just starting to think about the mobile
market the emerging markets like what

00:34:11.750 --> 00:34:11.760
market the emerging markets like what
 

00:34:11.760 --> 00:34:13.100
market the emerging markets like what
are they what are they you know the

00:34:13.100 --> 00:34:13.110
are they what are they you know the
 

00:34:13.110 --> 00:34:14.630
are they what are they you know the
first few things they could do to make

00:34:14.630 --> 00:34:14.640
first few things they could do to make
 

00:34:14.640 --> 00:34:18.020
first few things they could do to make
things better oh come on they could sure

00:34:18.020 --> 00:34:18.030
things better oh come on they could sure
 

00:34:18.030 --> 00:34:21.170
things better oh come on they could sure
I think a lot of the things that we're

00:34:21.170 --> 00:34:21.180
I think a lot of the things that we're
 

00:34:21.180 --> 00:34:22.850
I think a lot of the things that we're
talking about things like caching data

00:34:22.850 --> 00:34:22.860
talking about things like caching data
 

00:34:22.860 --> 00:34:25.940
talking about things like caching data
and and optimizing for your app not

00:34:25.940 --> 00:34:25.950
and and optimizing for your app not
 

00:34:25.950 --> 00:34:27.800

being online at this very second are

00:34:27.800 --> 00:34:27.810
being online at this very second are
 

00:34:27.810 --> 00:34:30.230
being online at this very second are
kind of just user experience and those

00:34:30.230 --> 00:34:30.240
kind of just user experience and those
 

00:34:30.240 --> 00:34:31.820
kind of just user experience and those
are just you just have to be in those

00:34:31.820 --> 00:34:31.830
are just you just have to be in those
 

00:34:31.830 --> 00:34:33.590
are just you just have to be in those
have those assumptions when you're

00:34:33.590 --> 00:34:33.600
have those assumptions when you're
 

00:34:33.600 --> 00:34:35.150
have those assumptions when you're
building your product it's really hard

00:34:35.150 --> 00:34:35.160
building your product it's really hard
 

00:34:35.160 --> 00:34:36.800
building your product it's really hard
to go back afterwards and being like oh

00:34:36.800 --> 00:34:36.810
to go back afterwards and being like oh
 

00:34:36.810 --> 00:34:38.450
to go back afterwards and being like oh
I'm gonna redesign it to work in these

00:34:38.450 --> 00:34:38.460
I'm gonna redesign it to work in these
 

00:34:38.460 --> 00:34:40.310
I'm gonna redesign it to work in these
things it's quite challenges I

00:34:40.310 --> 00:34:40.320
things it's quite challenges I
 

00:34:40.320 --> 00:34:43.790
things it's quite challenges I
challenging I know we're doing it but

00:34:43.790 --> 00:34:43.800
challenging I know we're doing it but
 

00:34:43.800 --> 00:34:45.950
challenging I know we're doing it but
for its when you're building a for a

00:34:45.950 --> 00:34:45.960
for its when you're building a for a
 

00:34:45.960 --> 00:34:47.090
for its when you're building a for a
small company you can move much faster

00:34:47.090 --> 00:34:47.100
small company you can move much faster
 

00:34:47.100 --> 00:34:48.920
small company you can move much faster
and you can do a lot but things like

00:34:48.920 --> 00:34:48.930
and you can do a lot but things like
 

00:34:48.930 --> 00:34:51.380
and you can do a lot but things like
caching data it's not hard like images

00:34:51.380 --> 00:34:51.390
caching data it's not hard like images
 

00:34:51.390 --> 00:34:54.140
caching data it's not hard like images
and things like that that's no brainer

00:34:54.140 --> 00:34:54.150
and things like that that's no brainer
 

00:34:54.150 --> 00:34:56.930
and things like that that's no brainer
type stuff prefetching and lists and

00:34:56.930 --> 00:34:56.940
type stuff prefetching and lists and
 

00:34:56.940 --> 00:34:58.390
type stuff prefetching and lists and
things like that are also not

00:34:58.390 --> 00:34:58.400
things like that are also not
 

00:34:58.400 --> 00:35:00.470
things like that are also not
understanding your users and their flow

00:35:00.470 --> 00:35:00.480
understanding your users and their flow
 

00:35:00.480 --> 00:35:02.510
understanding your users and their flow
understanding who your users are so

00:35:02.510 --> 00:35:02.520
understanding who your users are so
 

00:35:02.520 --> 00:35:04.370

implementing connection class in your

00:35:04.370 --> 00:35:04.380
implementing connection class in your
 

00:35:04.380 --> 00:35:06.440
implementing connection class in your
class just purely for your analytics

00:35:06.440 --> 00:35:06.450
class just purely for your analytics
 

00:35:06.450 --> 00:35:09.050
class just purely for your analytics
first that's actually most important

00:35:09.050 --> 00:35:09.060
first that's actually most important
 

00:35:09.060 --> 00:35:10.910
first that's actually most important
what we found just implement it as part

00:35:10.910 --> 00:35:10.920
what we found just implement it as part
 

00:35:10.920 --> 00:35:12.890
what we found just implement it as part
of the analytics try to understand

00:35:12.890 --> 00:35:12.900
of the analytics try to understand
 

00:35:12.900 --> 00:35:14.540
of the analytics try to understand
what's going on and then optimize for

00:35:14.540 --> 00:35:14.550
what's going on and then optimize for
 

00:35:14.550 --> 00:35:16.430
what's going on and then optimize for
scenarios that you see like you you

00:35:16.430 --> 00:35:16.440
scenarios that you see like you you
 

00:35:16.440 --> 00:35:18.950
scenarios that you see like you you
might see a login flow is like broken

00:35:18.950 --> 00:35:18.960
might see a login flow is like broken
 

00:35:18.960 --> 00:35:21.710
might see a login flow is like broken
and has a huge drop off on your class

00:35:21.710 --> 00:35:21.720
and has a huge drop off on your class
 

00:35:21.720 --> 00:35:23.840
and has a huge drop off on your class
2010 devices so you can grab a your

00:35:23.840 --> 00:35:23.850
2010 devices so you can grab a your
 

00:35:23.850 --> 00:35:25.520
2010 devices so you can grab a your
class 2010 device and then optimize for

00:35:25.520 --> 00:35:25.530
class 2010 device and then optimize for
 

00:35:25.530 --> 00:35:27.140
class 2010 device and then optimize for
that as opposed to trying to do

00:35:27.140 --> 00:35:27.150
that as opposed to trying to do
 

00:35:27.150 --> 00:35:29.950
that as opposed to trying to do
everything up front which is challenging

00:35:29.950 --> 00:35:29.960
everything up front which is challenging
 

00:35:29.960 --> 00:35:33.770
everything up front which is challenging
so data first analytics first and then

00:35:33.770 --> 00:35:33.780
so data first analytics first and then
 

00:35:33.780 --> 00:35:36.440
so data first analytics first and then
like find the big problems in your app

00:35:36.440 --> 00:35:36.450
like find the big problems in your app
 

00:35:36.450 --> 00:35:38.060
like find the big problems in your app
yeah and there's no way open source

00:35:38.060 --> 00:35:38.070
yeah and there's no way open source
 

00:35:38.070 --> 00:35:38.900
yeah and there's no way open source
things like here class a network

00:35:38.900 --> 00:35:38.910
things like here class a network
 

00:35:38.910 --> 00:35:40.460
things like here class a network
connection classes too because like a

00:35:40.460 --> 00:35:40.470
connection classes too because like a
 

00:35:40.470 --> 00:35:42.230

lot of engineers were you know in other

00:35:42.230 --> 00:35:42.240
lot of engineers were you know in other
 

00:35:42.240 --> 00:35:43.700
lot of engineers were you know in other
companies were asking hey what can we do

00:35:43.700 --> 00:35:43.710
companies were asking hey what can we do
 

00:35:43.710 --> 00:35:44.900
companies were asking hey what can we do
and we thought that would be useful for

00:35:44.900 --> 00:35:44.910
and we thought that would be useful for
 

00:35:44.910 --> 00:35:46.550
and we thought that would be useful for
them as well but I mean there are some

00:35:46.550 --> 00:35:46.560
them as well but I mean there are some
 

00:35:46.560 --> 00:35:48.230
them as well but I mean there are some
you know basic Pfizer's Alex at no just

00:35:48.230 --> 00:35:48.240
you know basic Pfizer's Alex at no just
 

00:35:48.240 --> 00:35:50.810
you know basic Pfizer's Alex at no just
so just cashing and we're going to talk

00:35:50.810 --> 00:35:50.820
so just cashing and we're going to talk
 

00:35:50.820 --> 00:35:52.880
so just cashing and we're going to talk
about a few things or like right now

00:35:52.880 --> 00:35:52.890
about a few things or like right now
 

00:35:52.890 --> 00:35:55.190
about a few things or like right now
some tools and some ideas that we've

00:35:55.190 --> 00:35:55.200
some tools and some ideas that we've
 

00:35:55.200 --> 00:35:57.440
some tools and some ideas that we've
essentially built into our apps to

00:35:57.440 --> 00:35:57.450
essentially built into our apps to
 

00:35:57.450 --> 00:35:59.210
essentially built into our apps to
essentially solve this issue because it

00:35:59.210 --> 00:35:59.220
essentially solve this issue because it
 

00:35:59.220 --> 00:36:02.240
essentially solve this issue because it
is a very difficult problem any more

00:36:02.240 --> 00:36:02.250
is a very difficult problem any more
 

00:36:02.250 --> 00:36:05.859
is a very difficult problem any more
questions before my one

00:36:05.859 --> 00:36:05.869
 
 

00:36:05.869 --> 00:36:11.390
 
alright so moving on to testing like you

00:36:11.390 --> 00:36:11.400
alright so moving on to testing like you
 

00:36:11.400 --> 00:36:13.250
alright so moving on to testing like you
know where you know most of us are here

00:36:13.250 --> 00:36:13.260
know where you know most of us are here
 

00:36:13.260 --> 00:36:15.290
know where you know most of us are here
we have the connections that we have and

00:36:15.290 --> 00:36:15.300
we have the connections that we have and
 

00:36:15.300 --> 00:36:17.420
we have the connections that we have and
they're pretty good how do we test for

00:36:17.420 --> 00:36:17.430
they're pretty good how do we test for
 

00:36:17.430 --> 00:36:19.849
they're pretty good how do we test for
bad networks how do we test for how the

00:36:19.849 --> 00:36:19.859
bad networks how do we test for how the
 

00:36:19.859 --> 00:36:22.660
bad networks how do we test for how the
apps work our apps work on bad networks

00:36:22.660 --> 00:36:22.670
apps work our apps work on bad networks
 

00:36:22.670 --> 00:36:25.490
apps work our apps work on bad networks
so one of the things we built last year

00:36:25.490 --> 00:36:25.500
so one of the things we built last year
 

00:36:25.500 --> 00:36:28.250
so one of the things we built last year
is called augmented traffic control and

00:36:28.250 --> 00:36:28.260
is called augmented traffic control and
 

00:36:28.260 --> 00:36:30.349
is called augmented traffic control and
it's a tool we've open sourced it's a

00:36:30.349 --> 00:36:30.359
it's a tool we've open sourced it's a
 

00:36:30.359 --> 00:36:32.390
it's a tool we've open sourced it's a
server you run on one of the computers

00:36:32.390 --> 00:36:32.400
server you run on one of the computers
 

00:36:32.400 --> 00:36:34.940
server you run on one of the computers
in your office and then it provides

00:36:34.940 --> 00:36:34.950
in your office and then it provides
 

00:36:34.950 --> 00:36:37.490
in your office and then it provides
essentially you connect to it via Wi-Fi

00:36:37.490 --> 00:36:37.500
essentially you connect to it via Wi-Fi
 

00:36:37.500 --> 00:36:39.829
essentially you connect to it via Wi-Fi
on your phone so essentially all the

00:36:39.829 --> 00:36:39.839
on your phone so essentially all the
 

00:36:39.839 --> 00:36:41.870
on your phone so essentially all the
traffic from your app or other apps on

00:36:41.870 --> 00:36:41.880
traffic from your app or other apps on
 

00:36:41.880 --> 00:36:44.180
traffic from your app or other apps on
your phone could go through augmented

00:36:44.180 --> 00:36:44.190
your phone could go through augmented
 

00:36:44.190 --> 00:36:46.339
your phone could go through augmented
traffic control and then there's presets

00:36:46.339 --> 00:36:46.349
traffic control and then there's presets
 

00:36:46.349 --> 00:36:48.710
traffic control and then there's presets
on there so you can for example see what

00:36:48.710 --> 00:36:48.720
on there so you can for example see what
 

00:36:48.720 --> 00:36:51.440
on there so you can for example see what
is my appt feel like on 2g in rural

00:36:51.440 --> 00:36:51.450
is my appt feel like on 2g in rural
 

00:36:51.450 --> 00:36:54.560
is my appt feel like on 2g in rural
India or when there's a black hole and

00:36:54.560 --> 00:36:54.570
India or when there's a black hole and
 

00:36:54.570 --> 00:36:56.690
India or when there's a black hole and
I'm sending packets out and everything

00:36:56.690 --> 00:36:56.700
I'm sending packets out and everything
 

00:36:56.700 --> 00:36:58.460
I'm sending packets out and everything
is telling me I have a connection but

00:36:58.460 --> 00:36:58.470
is telling me I have a connection but
 

00:36:58.470 --> 00:37:00.319
is telling me I have a connection but
nothing is coming back how does my app

00:37:00.319 --> 00:37:00.329
nothing is coming back how does my app

behave in these type of scenarios so

00:37:04.670 --> 00:37:04.680
behave in these type of scenarios so
 

00:37:04.680 --> 00:37:06.790
behave in these type of scenarios so
it's it's all open sourcing you guys can

00:37:06.790 --> 00:37:06.800
it's it's all open sourcing you guys can
 

00:37:06.800 --> 00:37:08.990
it's it's all open sourcing you guys can
look it up but essentially it's just the

00:37:08.990 --> 00:37:09.000
look it up but essentially it's just the
 

00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:10.880

software that will both handle like

00:37:15.589 --> 00:37:15.599
software that will both handle like
 

00:37:15.599 --> 00:37:18.460
software that will both handle like
latency bandwidth and also things like

00:37:18.460 --> 00:37:18.470
latency bandwidth and also things like
 

00:37:18.470 --> 00:37:21.200
latency bandwidth and also things like
intermittency so like you know some

00:37:21.200 --> 00:37:21.210
intermittency so like you know some
 

00:37:21.210 --> 00:37:22.550
intermittency so like you know some
requests will be faster than others

00:37:22.550 --> 00:37:22.560
requests will be faster than others
 

00:37:22.560 --> 00:37:24.230

tool and a great emulator so they've

00:37:34.370 --> 00:37:34.380
tool and a great emulator so they've
 

00:37:34.380 --> 00:37:37.280
tool and a great emulator so they've
built on the ability to throttle your

00:37:37.280 --> 00:37:37.290
built on the ability to throttle your
 

00:37:37.290 --> 00:37:40.010
built on the ability to throttle your
network and they have presets like 3G

00:37:40.010 --> 00:37:40.020
network and they have presets like 3G
 

00:37:40.020 --> 00:37:42.680
network and they have presets like 3G
and 4G edge so you can easily see what

it's like I actually got stuck on one of

00:37:44.599 --> 00:37:44.609
it's like I actually got stuck on one of
 

00:37:44.609 --> 00:37:46.010
it's like I actually got stuck on one of
these modes the other day and I was like

00:37:46.010 --> 00:37:46.020
these modes the other day and I was like
 

00:37:46.020 --> 00:37:47.780
these modes the other day and I was like
why is my apps so slow everything is

00:37:47.780 --> 00:37:47.790
why is my apps so slow everything is
 

00:37:47.790 --> 00:37:48.859

then like what the actual delay and

00:38:08.990 --> 00:38:09.000
then like what the actual delay and
 

00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:13.140
then like what the actual delay and
speed is for those networks

00:38:13.140 --> 00:38:13.150
 
 

00:38:13.150 --> 00:38:15.870
 
so I mean to a lot of this technologists

very important like when we develop our

00:38:37.950 --> 00:38:37.960
very important like when we develop our
 

00:38:37.960 --> 00:38:40.140

sort of understand how the features feel

00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:42.010
sort of understand how the features feel
 

00:38:42.010 --> 00:38:43.950
sort of understand how the features feel
and how they work and so that's a

00:38:43.950 --> 00:38:43.960
and how they work and so that's a
 

00:38:43.960 --> 00:38:45.660
and how they work and so that's a
challenge because you know with Wi-Fi

00:38:45.660 --> 00:38:45.670

all the time and you know it can work
 

00:39:02.380 --> 00:39:03.539
all the time and you know it can work
with a cartoon network and then just

00:39:03.539 --> 00:39:03.549
with a cartoon network and then just
 

00:39:03.549 --> 00:39:06.000
with a cartoon network and then just
rattle it so that's one doc quitting

00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:06.010
rattle it so that's one doc quitting
 

00:39:06.010 --> 00:39:07.799

the power of a sleep statement right in

00:39:14.910 --> 00:39:14.920
the power of a sleep statement right in
 

00:39:14.920 --> 00:39:17.430
the power of a sleep statement right in
your app if you just you know if you

00:39:17.430 --> 00:39:17.440
your app if you just you know if you
 

00:39:17.440 --> 00:39:18.660

so for the engineers where you just slow

00:39:20.819 --> 00:39:20.829
so for the engineers where you just slow
 

00:39:20.829 --> 00:39:22.710
so for the engineers where you just slow
down your network calls all of them I

00:39:22.710 --> 00:39:22.720
down your network calls all of them I
 

00:39:22.720 --> 00:39:23.880
down your network calls all of them I
mean that's actually a great way to

00:39:23.880 --> 00:39:23.890
mean that's actually a great way to
 

00:39:23.890 --> 00:39:26.220

permit risible so you can change this

00:39:27.599 --> 00:39:27.609
permit risible so you can change this
 

00:39:27.609 --> 00:39:30.269
permit risible so you can change this
you know but that's that's one way to do

00:39:30.269 --> 00:39:30.279
you know but that's that's one way to do
 

00:39:30.279 --> 00:39:33.329
you know but that's that's one way to do
that and another way another way simple

00:39:33.329 --> 00:39:33.339
that and another way another way simple
 

00:39:33.339 --> 00:39:35.579
that and another way another way simple
way to do things like to for example to

00:39:35.579 --> 00:39:35.589
way to do things like to for example to
 

00:39:35.589 --> 00:39:37.440
way to do things like to for example to
demonstrate what intermittency might

00:39:37.440 --> 00:39:37.450

you know like richness of how the
 

00:39:43.869 --> 00:39:45.269
you know like richness of how the
network's work and how many ways they

00:39:45.269 --> 00:39:45.279
network's work and how many ways they
 

00:39:45.279 --> 00:39:47.130
network's work and how many ways they
can pale but it'll give you basic idea

00:39:47.130 --> 00:39:47.140
can pale but it'll give you basic idea
 

00:39:47.140 --> 00:39:49.140

what happens our network all starts

00:39:49.140 --> 00:39:49.150
what happens our network all starts
 

00:39:49.150 --> 00:39:50.760

constants are bad that's what we found
 

00:41:36.970 --> 00:41:40.109
constants are bad that's what we found
is that I like the quote the only thing

that is constant is change so we

00:41:43.170 --> 00:41:43.180
that is constant is change so we
 

00:41:43.180 --> 00:41:45.540
that is constant is change so we

our configuration system for doing these

00:45:06.240 --> 00:45:06.250
our configuration system for doing these
 

00:45:06.250 --> 00:45:10.110
our configuration system for doing these
things the key part of the system is we

00:45:10.110 --> 00:45:10.120
things the key part of the system is we
 

00:45:10.120 --> 00:45:11.640
things the key part of the system is we
actually want to push a lot of those

00:45:11.640 --> 00:45:11.650
actually want to push a lot of those
 

00:45:11.650 --> 00:45:12.960
actually want to push a lot of those
parameters from the server so we can

00:45:12.960 --> 00:45:12.970
parameters from the server so we can
 

00:45:12.970 --> 00:45:14.280
parameters from the server so we can
quickly adjust them or use the power of

00:45:14.280 --> 00:45:14.290
quickly adjust them or use the power of
 

00:45:14.290 --> 00:45:16.320
quickly adjust them or use the power of
the server to do analysis and decide hey

for this type of users this is the best

00:45:17.730 --> 00:45:17.740
for this type of users this is the best
 

00:45:17.740 --> 00:45:19.860
for this type of users this is the best
value and so that's precisely what we do

00:45:19.860 --> 00:45:19.870
value and so that's precisely what we do
 

00:45:19.870 --> 00:45:21.030
value and so that's precisely what we do
so different users can get different

00:45:21.030 --> 00:45:21.040
so different users can get different
 

00:45:21.040 --> 00:45:23.040
so different users can get different
parameters in different values so the

00:45:23.040 --> 00:45:23.050
parameters in different values so the
 

00:45:23.050 --> 00:45:24.360
parameters in different values so the
behavior the app especially

00:45:24.360 --> 00:45:24.370
behavior the app especially
 

00:45:24.370 --> 00:45:26.970
behavior the app especially

us to experiment on things in anytime so
 

00:45:34.180 --> 00:45:37.140
us to experiment on things in anytime so
even if we are you know pretty sure that

this is the best configuration parameter
it might not be the best configuration

00:45:39.480 --> 00:45:39.490
it might not be the best configuration
 

00:45:39.490 --> 00:45:41.310
it might not be the best configuration
parameter six months later so we can

upgrade very quickly I mean you still

00:45:59.160 --> 00:45:59.170
upgrade very quickly I mean you still

have a lot of old versions out there and

00:46:01.320 --> 00:46:01.330
have a lot of old versions out there and
 

00:46:01.330 --> 00:46:02.820
have a lot of old versions out there and
you know you have to sort of honor that

00:46:02.820 --> 00:46:02.830
you know you have to sort of honor that
 

00:46:02.830 --> 00:46:05.400
you know you have to sort of honor that
so if you ever build a system like that

00:46:05.400 --> 00:46:05.410
so if you ever build a system like that
 

00:46:05.410 --> 00:46:06.950
so if you ever build a system like that
you have to worry about versioning and

00:46:06.950 --> 00:46:06.960
you have to worry about versioning and
 

00:46:06.960 --> 00:46:09.360
you have to worry about versioning and
making sure that you can deal with that

00:46:09.360 --> 00:46:09.370
making sure that you can deal with that
 

00:46:09.370 --> 00:46:10.950
making sure that you can deal with that
there are many different ways to deal

00:46:10.950 --> 00:46:10.960
there are many different ways to deal
 

00:46:10.960 --> 00:46:13.650
there are many different ways to deal
with that you know and but that's that's

00:46:13.650 --> 00:46:13.660
with that you know and but that's that's
 

00:46:13.660 --> 00:46:16.650
with that you know and but that's that's
one of the problems we have to solve and

00:46:16.650 --> 00:46:16.660
one of the problems we have to solve and
 

00:46:16.660 --> 00:46:19.260
one of the problems we have to solve and
then sort of going beyond a/b testing I

00:46:19.260 --> 00:46:19.270
then sort of going beyond a/b testing I

the facebook version of that the
facebook bandit what allows you to do is

facebook bandit what allows you to do is
 

00:46:45.100 --> 00:46:46.410
facebook bandit what allows you to do is
to experiment with a large number of

to experiment with a large number of
 

00:46:46.420 --> 00:46:48.480
to experiment with a large number of

degrade user experience so that system
helps

00:47:07.840 --> 00:47:07.850
helps
 

00:47:07.850 --> 00:47:11.140
helps
to get get there quickly and it allows

00:47:11.140 --> 00:47:11.150
to get get there quickly and it allows
 

00:47:11.150 --> 00:47:12.550
to get get there quickly and it allows
us to optimize for competing variables

00:47:12.550 --> 00:47:12.560
us to optimize for competing variables
 

00:47:12.560 --> 00:47:13.690
us to optimize for competing variables
you know quite often for these

00:47:13.690 --> 00:47:13.700
you know quite often for these
 

00:47:13.700 --> 00:47:15.490
you know quite often for these
configurations you're not just thinking

00:47:15.490 --> 00:47:15.500
configurations you're not just thinking
 

00:47:15.500 --> 00:47:17.530
configurations you're not just thinking
about one variable a great example here

00:47:17.530 --> 00:47:17.540
about one variable a great example here
 

00:47:17.540 --> 00:47:19.480
about one variable a great example here
is data usage I mean you you do data

00:47:19.480 --> 00:47:19.490
is data usage I mean you you do data
 

00:47:19.490 --> 00:47:21.670
is data usage I mean you you do data
usage so your performance improves and

00:47:21.670 --> 00:47:21.680
usage so your performance improves and
 

00:47:21.680 --> 00:47:23.590
usage so your performance improves and
users spend more time working with the

00:47:23.590 --> 00:47:23.600
users spend more time working with the
 

00:47:23.600 --> 00:47:25.420
users spend more time working with the
app than they do look in the spinner but

00:47:25.420 --> 00:47:25.430
app than they do look in the spinner but
 

00:47:25.430 --> 00:47:27.760
app than they do look in the spinner but
data usage itself is of course at one of

00:47:27.760 --> 00:47:27.770
data usage itself is of course at one of
 

00:47:27.770 --> 00:47:28.960
data usage itself is of course at one of
the parameters and you don't want to

00:47:28.960 --> 00:47:28.970
the parameters and you don't want to
 

00:47:28.970 --> 00:47:35.050
the parameters and you don't want to
drive that value too high and the the

00:47:35.050 --> 00:47:35.060
drive that value too high and the the
 

00:47:35.060 --> 00:47:36.580
drive that value too high and the the
story here is the story of how we did

00:47:36.580 --> 00:47:36.590
story here is the story of how we did
 

00:47:36.590 --> 00:47:39.280
story here is the story of how we did
the prefetching while scrolling so as we

00:47:39.280 --> 00:47:39.290
the prefetching while scrolling so as we
 

00:47:39.290 --> 00:47:41.140
the prefetching while scrolling so as we
scroll through the newsfeed we prefetch

00:47:41.140 --> 00:47:41.150
scroll through the newsfeed we prefetch
 

00:47:41.150 --> 00:47:43.090
scroll through the newsfeed we prefetch
stories ahead of time because we don't

00:47:43.090 --> 00:47:43.100
stories ahead of time because we don't
 

00:47:43.100 --> 00:47:44.950
stories ahead of time because we don't
want you to hit that moment where you're

00:47:44.950 --> 00:47:44.960
want you to hit that moment where you're
 

00:47:44.960 --> 00:47:47.050
want you to hit that moment where you're
sort of visibly looking at the at the

00:47:47.050 --> 00:47:47.060
sort of visibly looking at the at the
 

00:47:47.060 --> 00:47:48.820
sort of visibly looking at the at the
spinner while we're trying to get the

00:47:48.820 --> 00:47:48.830
spinner while we're trying to get the
 

00:47:48.830 --> 00:47:51.220
spinner while we're trying to get the
next set of stories and originally when

00:47:51.220 --> 00:47:51.230
next set of stories and originally when
 

00:47:51.230 --> 00:47:52.540
next set of stories and originally when
we did this we just said well you know

00:47:52.540 --> 00:47:52.550
we did this we just said well you know
 

00:47:52.550 --> 00:47:54.400
we did this we just said well you know
we'll just a bit test look at a few

00:47:54.400 --> 00:47:54.410
we'll just a bit test look at a few
 

00:47:54.410 --> 00:47:56.230
we'll just a bit test look at a few
values and we find out that generally

00:47:56.230 --> 00:47:56.240
values and we find out that generally
 

00:47:56.240 --> 00:47:59.320
values and we find out that generally
worldwide 10 is a fantastic number it

00:47:59.320 --> 00:47:59.330
worldwide 10 is a fantastic number it
 

00:47:59.330 --> 00:48:00.970
worldwide 10 is a fantastic number it
needs to be and it could be the best

00:48:00.970 --> 00:48:00.980
needs to be and it could be the best
 

00:48:00.980 --> 00:48:03.730
needs to be and it could be the best
number and we just will prefetch 10

00:48:03.730 --> 00:48:03.740
number and we just will prefetch 10
 

00:48:03.740 --> 00:48:04.900
number and we just will prefetch 10
stories ahead when you have when you're

00:48:04.900 --> 00:48:04.910
stories ahead when you have when you're
 

00:48:04.910 --> 00:48:06.850
stories ahead when you have when you're
10 stories from the moment where we

00:48:06.850 --> 00:48:06.860
10 stories from the moment where we
 

00:48:06.860 --> 00:48:08.200
10 stories from the moment where we
don't have any more stories we will go

00:48:08.200 --> 00:48:08.210
don't have any more stories we will go
 

00:48:08.210 --> 00:48:10.960
don't have any more stories we will go
ahead and prefetch and then when the

00:48:10.960 --> 00:48:10.970
ahead and prefetch and then when the
 

00:48:10.970 --> 00:48:12.520
ahead and prefetch and then when the
Bandit came onto the scene we decided

00:48:12.520 --> 00:48:12.530
Bandit came onto the scene we decided
 

00:48:12.530 --> 00:48:13.480
Bandit came onto the scene we decided
that we're going to run this for the

00:48:13.480 --> 00:48:13.490
that we're going to run this for the
 

00:48:13.490 --> 00:48:18.160
that we're going to run this for the
Bandit and so we can figure out know the

00:48:18.160 --> 00:48:18.170
Bandit and so we can figure out know the
 

00:48:18.170 --> 00:48:19.360
Bandit and so we can figure out know the
best configurations for different

00:48:19.360 --> 00:48:19.370
best configurations for different
 

00:48:19.370 --> 00:48:20.680
best configurations for different
networks in particular because we had

00:48:20.680 --> 00:48:20.690
networks in particular because we had
 

00:48:20.690 --> 00:48:21.790
networks in particular because we had
this crunch that from the different

00:48:21.790 --> 00:48:21.800
this crunch that from the different
 

00:48:21.800 --> 00:48:22.660
this crunch that from the different
networks we might get something

00:48:22.660 --> 00:48:22.670
networks we might get something
 

00:48:22.670 --> 00:48:28.270
networks we might get something
different and bend it actually went for

00:48:28.270 --> 00:48:28.280
different and bend it actually went for
 

00:48:28.280 --> 00:48:30.280
different and bend it actually went for
27 different configurations a

00:48:30.280 --> 00:48:30.290
27 different configurations a
 

00:48:30.290 --> 00:48:31.720
27 different configurations a
configuration something like that like

00:48:31.720 --> 00:48:31.730
configuration something like that like
 

00:48:31.730 --> 00:48:33.940
configuration something like that like
little matrix over here different number

00:48:33.940 --> 00:48:33.950
little matrix over here different number
 

00:48:33.950 --> 00:48:35.500
little matrix over here different number
of stories that you prefetch ahead for

00:48:35.500 --> 00:48:35.510
of stories that you prefetch ahead for
 

00:48:35.510 --> 00:48:38.530
of stories that you prefetch ahead for
on different connections and 1st they

00:48:38.530 --> 00:48:38.540
on different connections and 1st they
 

00:48:38.540 --> 00:48:39.730
on different connections and 1st they
sort of random and look at what their

00:48:39.730 --> 00:48:39.740
sort of random and look at what their
 

00:48:39.740 --> 00:48:41.650
sort of random and look at what their
usage would look like from different

00:48:41.650 --> 00:48:41.660
usage would look like from different
 

00:48:41.660 --> 00:48:44.080
usage would look like from different
configurations but the real interesting

00:48:44.080 --> 00:48:44.090
configurations but the real interesting
 

00:48:44.090 --> 00:48:45.520
configurations but the real interesting
thing here is optimization for multiple

00:48:45.520 --> 00:48:45.530
thing here is optimization for multiple
 

00:48:45.530 --> 00:48:47.290
thing here is optimization for multiple
parameters because yeah you can reduce

00:48:47.290 --> 00:48:47.300
parameters because yeah you can reduce
 

00:48:47.300 --> 00:48:49.780
parameters because yeah you can reduce
data usage by doing fewer than 10 but

00:48:49.780 --> 00:48:49.790
data usage by doing fewer than 10 but
 

00:48:49.790 --> 00:48:51.040
data usage by doing fewer than 10 but
you want to do that in such a way that

00:48:51.040 --> 00:48:51.050
you want to do that in such a way that
 

00:48:51.050 --> 00:48:52.780
you want to do that in such a way that
users don't end up you know looking at

00:48:52.780 --> 00:48:52.790
users don't end up you know looking at
 

00:48:52.790 --> 00:48:53.770
users don't end up you know looking at
that spinner because they coat the

00:48:53.770 --> 00:48:53.780
that spinner because they coat the
 

00:48:53.780 --> 00:48:55.720
that spinner because they coat the
entire work is there to make sure that

00:48:55.720 --> 00:48:55.730
entire work is there to make sure that
 

00:48:55.730 --> 00:48:58.270
entire work is there to make sure that
you can actually get to do the stories

00:48:58.270 --> 00:48:58.280
you can actually get to do the stories
 

00:48:58.280 --> 00:49:01.000
you can actually get to do the stories
before user gets to them and so they are

00:49:01.000 --> 00:49:01.010
before user gets to them and so they are
 

00:49:01.010 --> 00:49:02.590
before user gets to them and so they are
the engagement continues to be Kai

00:49:02.590 --> 00:49:02.600
the engagement continues to be Kai
 

00:49:02.600 --> 00:49:04.120
the engagement continues to be Kai
because engaging with the app instead of

00:49:04.120 --> 00:49:04.130
because engaging with the app instead of
 

00:49:04.130 --> 00:49:05.830
because engaging with the app instead of
waiting for the for the stories to load

00:49:05.830 --> 00:49:05.840
waiting for the for the stories to load
 

00:49:05.840 --> 00:49:07.630
waiting for the for the stories to load
and so when you when you actually map

00:49:07.630 --> 00:49:07.640
and so when you when you actually map
 

00:49:07.640 --> 00:49:10.390
and so when you when you actually map
this 27 different cases you see this

00:49:10.390 --> 00:49:10.400
this 27 different cases you see this
 

00:49:10.400 --> 00:49:12.100
this 27 different cases you see this
pattern which you know peretta frontier

00:49:12.100 --> 00:49:12.110
pattern which you know peretta frontier
 

00:49:12.110 --> 00:49:14.470
pattern which you know peretta frontier
is just a fancy word of saying like for

00:49:14.470 --> 00:49:14.480
is just a fancy word of saying like for
 

00:49:14.480 --> 00:49:16.840
is just a fancy word of saying like for
all the other configurations here there

00:49:16.840 --> 00:49:16.850
all the other configurations here there
 

00:49:16.850 --> 00:49:18.760
all the other configurations here there
is a better configuration where you can

00:49:18.760 --> 00:49:18.770
is a better configuration where you can
 

00:49:18.770 --> 00:49:20.440
is a better configuration where you can
improve on one axis without sacrificing

00:49:20.440 --> 00:49:20.450
improve on one axis without sacrificing
 

00:49:20.450 --> 00:49:21.060
improve on one axis without sacrificing
anything on there

00:49:21.060 --> 00:49:21.070
anything on there
 

00:49:21.070 --> 00:49:23.910
anything on there
right and so the tool helps us to figure

00:49:23.910 --> 00:49:23.920
right and so the tool helps us to figure
 

00:49:23.920 --> 00:49:25.410
right and so the tool helps us to figure
this out and actually turns out that the

00:49:25.410 --> 00:49:25.420
this out and actually turns out that the
 

00:49:25.420 --> 00:49:27.240
this out and actually turns out that the
relatives for different values of the 27

00:49:27.240 --> 00:49:27.250
relatives for different values of the 27
 

00:49:27.250 --> 00:49:30.270
relatives for different values of the 27
that are like that which cannot be

00:49:30.270 --> 00:49:30.280
that are like that which cannot be
 

00:49:30.280 --> 00:49:31.290
that are like that which cannot be
improving your father and one of the

other access to them I extreme you know

00:49:33.630 --> 00:49:33.640
other access to them I extreme you know
 

00:49:33.640 --> 00:49:35.850
other access to them I extreme you know
you can obviously run with no data usage

00:49:35.850 --> 00:49:35.860
you can obviously run with no data usage
 

00:49:35.860 --> 00:49:36.930
you can obviously run with no data usage
but then you're not going to get much

00:49:36.930 --> 00:49:36.940
but then you're not going to get much
 

00:49:36.940 --> 00:49:39.630
but then you're not going to get much
out of this or you can just say you know

00:49:39.630 --> 00:49:39.640
out of this or you can just say you know
 

00:49:39.640 --> 00:49:40.920
out of this or you can just say you know
you're going to get a lot but data usage

00:49:40.920 --> 00:49:40.930
you're going to get a lot but data usage
 

00:49:40.930 --> 00:49:43.530
you're going to get a lot but data usage
is you know is still a concern and you

00:49:43.530 --> 00:49:43.540
is you know is still a concern and you
 

00:49:43.540 --> 00:49:44.880
is you know is still a concern and you
have to worry about and then you just

00:49:44.880 --> 00:49:44.890
have to worry about and then you just
 

00:49:44.890 --> 00:49:46.920
have to worry about and then you just
down to two values and then then you can

00:49:46.920 --> 00:49:46.930
down to two values and then then you can
 

00:49:46.930 --> 00:49:48.390
down to two values and then then you can
I be test on these two values and figure

00:49:48.390 --> 00:49:48.400
I be test on these two values and figure
 

00:49:48.400 --> 00:49:50.910
I be test on these two values and figure
out what the best value is and I let

00:49:50.910 --> 00:49:50.920
out what the best value is and I let
 

00:49:50.920 --> 00:49:52.380
out what the best value is and I let
Alex finish on that because that was one

00:49:52.380 --> 00:49:52.390
Alex finish on that because that was one
 

00:49:52.390 --> 00:49:56.460
Alex finish on that because that was one
of his projects yes so we started off

00:49:56.460 --> 00:49:56.470
of his projects yes so we started off
 

00:49:56.470 --> 00:49:58.260
of his projects yes so we started off
with 10 that seemed like a good number

00:49:58.260 --> 00:49:58.270
with 10 that seemed like a good number
 

00:49:58.270 --> 00:50:01.050
with 10 that seemed like a good number
we tested out 27 different configuration

00:50:01.050 --> 00:50:01.060
we tested out 27 different configuration
 

00:50:01.060 --> 00:50:04.080
we tested out 27 different configuration
and what we found is that 10 was

00:50:04.080 --> 00:50:04.090
and what we found is that 10 was
 

00:50:04.090 --> 00:50:05.400
and what we found is that 10 was
actually a pretty good number we did a

00:50:05.400 --> 00:50:05.410
actually a pretty good number we did a
 

00:50:05.410 --> 00:50:08.070
actually a pretty good number we did a
pretty decent job for certain types of

00:50:08.070 --> 00:50:08.080
pretty decent job for certain types of
 

00:50:08.080 --> 00:50:11.280
pretty decent job for certain types of
users and it didn't hurt anyone else but

00:50:11.280 --> 00:50:11.290
users and it didn't hurt anyone else but
 

00:50:11.290 --> 00:50:13.560
users and it didn't hurt anyone else but
we could actually optimize when you're

00:50:13.560 --> 00:50:13.570
we could actually optimize when you're
 

00:50:13.570 --> 00:50:15.810
we could actually optimize when you're
on good and excellent networks to

00:50:15.810 --> 00:50:15.820
on good and excellent networks to
 

00:50:15.820 --> 00:50:18.000
on good and excellent networks to
prefetch less aggressively so this

00:50:18.000 --> 00:50:18.010
prefetch less aggressively so this
 

00:50:18.010 --> 00:50:20.040
prefetch less aggressively so this
actually reduce data usage for these

00:50:20.040 --> 00:50:20.050
actually reduce data usage for these
 

00:50:20.050 --> 00:50:22.200
actually reduce data usage for these
people dramatically because now they

00:50:22.200 --> 00:50:22.210
people dramatically because now they
 

00:50:22.210 --> 00:50:24.210
people dramatically because now they
didn't essentially download things that

00:50:24.210 --> 00:50:24.220
didn't essentially download things that
 

00:50:24.220 --> 00:50:26.910
didn't essentially download things that
didn't need and also decrease server CPU

00:50:26.910 --> 00:50:26.920
didn't need and also decrease server CPU
 

00:50:26.920 --> 00:50:29.520
didn't need and also decrease server CPU
we saw like what is that fifty-seven

00:50:29.520 --> 00:50:29.530
we saw like what is that fifty-seven
 

00:50:29.530 --> 00:50:32.730
we saw like what is that fifty-seven
percent of users we're on Wi-Fi so

00:50:32.730 --> 00:50:32.740
percent of users we're on Wi-Fi so
 

00:50:32.740 --> 00:50:35.580
percent of users we're on Wi-Fi so
fifty-seven percent of users used to or

00:50:35.580 --> 00:50:35.590
fifty-seven percent of users used to or
 

00:50:35.590 --> 00:50:39.330
fifty-seven percent of users used to or
some percentage of their 57% used to

00:50:39.330 --> 00:50:39.340
some percentage of their 57% used to
 

00:50:39.340 --> 00:50:41.010
some percentage of their 57% used to
prefetch relatively aggressively when

00:50:41.010 --> 00:50:41.020
prefetch relatively aggressively when
 

00:50:41.020 --> 00:50:43.130
prefetch relatively aggressively when
they didn't need to so we were able to

00:50:43.130 --> 00:50:43.140
they didn't need to so we were able to
 

00:50:43.140 --> 00:50:46.140
they didn't need to so we were able to
drastically reduce server CPU which

00:50:46.140 --> 00:50:46.150
drastically reduce server CPU which
 

00:50:46.150 --> 00:50:48.990
drastically reduce server CPU which
costs money without actually hurting

00:50:48.990 --> 00:50:49.000
costs money without actually hurting
 

00:50:49.000 --> 00:50:51.210
costs money without actually hurting
engagement no one saw any more spinners

00:50:51.210 --> 00:50:51.220
engagement no one saw any more spinners
 

00:50:51.220 --> 00:50:54.240
engagement no one saw any more spinners
probably no one noticed so then we just

00:50:54.240 --> 00:50:54.250
probably no one noticed so then we just
 

00:50:54.250 --> 00:50:57.720
probably no one noticed so then we just
now have one set of values but we do it

00:50:57.720 --> 00:50:57.730
now have one set of values but we do it
 

00:50:57.730 --> 00:51:00.120
now have one set of values but we do it
based instead of 10 we now do a based on

00:51:00.120 --> 00:51:00.130
based instead of 10 we now do a based on
 

00:51:00.130 --> 00:51:02.220
based instead of 10 we now do a based on
connection class so you can see we

00:51:02.220 --> 00:51:02.230
connection class so you can see we
 

00:51:02.230 --> 00:51:03.870
connection class so you can see we
actually have a JSON configuration

00:51:03.870 --> 00:51:03.880
actually have a JSON configuration
 

00:51:03.880 --> 00:51:05.850
actually have a JSON configuration
option object that looks exactly like

00:51:05.850 --> 00:51:05.860
option object that looks exactly like
 

00:51:05.860 --> 00:51:08.580
option object that looks exactly like
that we say when you're an excellent use

00:51:08.580 --> 00:51:08.590
that we say when you're an excellent use
 

00:51:08.590 --> 00:51:11.100
that we say when you're an excellent use
free when you're on good use 5 and these

00:51:11.100 --> 00:51:11.110
free when you're on good use 5 and these
 

00:51:11.110 --> 00:51:12.390
free when you're on good use 5 and these
will change right you might be on an

00:51:12.390 --> 00:51:12.400
will change right you might be on an
 

00:51:12.400 --> 00:51:14.040
will change right you might be on an
excellent connection now and you turn

00:51:14.040 --> 00:51:14.050
excellent connection now and you turn
 

00:51:14.050 --> 00:51:15.690
excellent connection now and you turn
off Wi-Fi and you go walk out the door

00:51:15.690 --> 00:51:15.700
off Wi-Fi and you go walk out the door
 

00:51:15.700 --> 00:51:17.940
off Wi-Fi and you go walk out the door
and now you need to do another fetch now

00:51:17.940 --> 00:51:17.950
and now you need to do another fetch now
 

00:51:17.950 --> 00:51:20.610
and now you need to do another fetch now
you get the value 10 so it's these

00:51:20.610 --> 00:51:20.620
you get the value 10 so it's these
 

00:51:20.620 --> 00:51:23.079
you get the value 10 so it's these
values can change over the life

00:51:23.079 --> 00:51:23.089
values can change over the life
 

00:51:23.089 --> 00:51:27.459
values can change over the life
of the the app and that's it that was a

00:51:27.459 --> 00:51:27.469
of the the app and that's it that was a
 

00:51:27.469 --> 00:51:29.859
of the the app and that's it that was a
lot that's that's our presentation so

00:51:29.859 --> 00:51:29.869
lot that's that's our presentation so
 

00:51:29.869 --> 00:51:32.950
lot that's that's our presentation so
thanks very much for coming and
