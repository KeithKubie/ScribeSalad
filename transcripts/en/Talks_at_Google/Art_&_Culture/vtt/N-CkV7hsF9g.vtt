SRIDHAR RAMASWAMY:
Good afternoon.

00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:14.920
Maestro Amjad Ali
Khan is synonymous

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:18.040
with Indian classical
music and, of course,

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:22.670
the mystical instrument
that he plays, the sarod.

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:26.440
He started playing the
sarod at an early age of 6.

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:31.180
And the rest, as
they say, is history.

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:37.750
And he's an amazing
award-winning performer,

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:41.220
whose appeal and
collaborations have transcended

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:42.870
borders, transcended genres.

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:50.470
And we also have the pleasure of
having his two sons, Amaan Ali

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:54.860
Bangash and Ayaan Ali
Bangash with us today.

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:58.800
These are also amazing
musicians in their own right.

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:02.530
And they're going to be
performing for us as well.

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:05.710
They have collaborated
together on several projects,

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:10.050
in addition to growing really
successful solo careers.

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:14.310
And it's quite an honor
for all of us-- for me--

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:19.560
to have them be with us in
this amazing new event center.

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:24.640
So I'd like all of you to stand
up and give Maestro Amjad Ali

Good afternoon.

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:06.280
[HINDI] We'll present some
folk music from Bengal,

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:08.560
where we will also
present a song

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:13.660
by the iconic poet and
composer, the great [INAUDIBLE],,

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:16.990
followed by a
composition in Rag Durga.

and today's language,

AMJAD ALI KHAN: While
playing the sarod,

00:17:06.220 --> 00:17:10.404
I'm not pressing the
string with my fingertips.

00:17:10.404 --> 00:17:15.530
While it's played with
fingertips-- cello, sitar--

00:17:15.530 --> 00:17:18.410
but if I play sarod
with fingertips,

00:17:18.410 --> 00:17:21.608
it will sound like this.

00:17:21.608 --> 00:17:23.576
[PLUCKING SAROD]

00:17:29.490 --> 00:17:31.830
So this is the
sound of fingertips.

00:17:31.830 --> 00:17:34.880
But to bring out the
human expressions,

00:17:34.880 --> 00:17:38.930
the vocal expressions, I have to
press the string with the edge

00:17:38.930 --> 00:17:40.640
of my fingernails.

00:17:40.640 --> 00:17:44.924

00:18:14.410 --> 00:18:16.810
Most of the songs--

00:18:16.810 --> 00:18:21.990
they are based on
language, text, lyrics.

00:18:21.990 --> 00:18:25.050
But in 13th century,
Hazrat Amir Khusro,

00:18:25.050 --> 00:18:30.390
a Sufi saint who created
[INAUDIBLE] called Qalbana.

00:18:30.390 --> 00:18:34.480
He created a style of
singing called Tarana.

00:18:34.480 --> 00:18:39.550
So Tarana doesn't deal with
language or lyrics or text.

00:18:39.550 --> 00:18:42.310
So he created a language
of music, language

00:18:42.310 --> 00:18:44.920
of syllables and sound.

00:18:44.920 --> 00:18:45.970

SRIDHAR RAMASWAMY:
Akhansa, you come

00:23:50.250 --> 00:23:53.527
from a long line of musicians
and classical performers.

00:23:53.527 --> 00:23:54.360
AMJAD ALI KHAN: Yes.

00:23:54.360 --> 00:23:55.943
SRIDHAR RAMASWAMY:
In fact, I've heard

00:23:55.943 --> 00:24:00.302
that the instrument
sarod, itself, came

00:24:00.302 --> 00:24:01.260
from their forefathers.

00:24:01.260 --> 00:24:03.343
Can you tell us a little
bit about the instrument?

00:24:03.343 --> 00:24:05.250
AMJAD ALI KHAN: Yes,
actually, "sarod"

00:24:05.250 --> 00:24:11.760
is a Persian word which
means music, not [INAUDIBLE]..

00:24:11.760 --> 00:24:15.420
And my forefathers, they
came from Afghanistan,

00:24:15.420 --> 00:24:17.520
[INAUDIBLE] India.

00:24:17.520 --> 00:24:21.050
And my forefathers,
they were rabab players.

00:24:21.050 --> 00:24:25.020
The rabab is a Afghan
instrument, in Kashmir, also--

00:24:25.020 --> 00:24:26.970
Central Asia.

00:24:26.970 --> 00:24:31.560
So they modified
from rabab to sarod.

00:24:31.560 --> 00:24:34.860
And there are nearly
500 sarod players, now,

00:24:34.860 --> 00:24:36.420
all over the world.

00:24:36.420 --> 00:24:39.270
And they are all connected.

00:24:39.270 --> 00:24:42.940
Whoever is playing
sarod, they were taught

00:24:42.940 --> 00:24:44.990
by my forefathers, [INAUDIBLE].

00:24:49.270 --> 00:24:51.210
There are so many names.

00:24:51.210 --> 00:24:53.740
So they are the
seventh generation

00:24:53.740 --> 00:24:55.700
of [INAUDIBLE], of our family.

00:24:55.700 --> 00:24:57.200
SRIDHAR RAMASWAMY:
That's wonderful.

00:24:57.200 --> 00:24:58.199
That's wonderful.

00:24:58.199 --> 00:24:59.576

00:25:02.330 --> 00:25:03.640
You played solo for us.

00:25:03.640 --> 00:25:04.900
It was such an amazing treat.

00:25:04.900 --> 00:25:06.910
You also performed
with your sons.

00:25:06.910 --> 00:25:09.700
How do the different
experiences compare?

00:25:09.700 --> 00:25:16.760
AMJAD ALI KHAN: You see,
by the grace of God,

00:25:16.760 --> 00:25:22.830
they have their own mission,
their own vision of music.

00:25:22.830 --> 00:25:24.980
Amaan's approach of
music is different.

00:25:24.980 --> 00:25:27.380
Ayaan's approach is different.

00:25:27.380 --> 00:25:29.060
And sometimes, they play duet.

00:25:29.060 --> 00:25:31.440
Sometimes, we play
three of us together.

00:25:31.440 --> 00:25:34.080
AMAAN ALI BANGASH: We
like to accompany him.

00:25:34.080 --> 00:25:36.830
AMJAD ALI KHAN: And also,
they are invited now

00:25:36.830 --> 00:25:38.060
for solo recitals.

00:25:38.060 --> 00:25:43.130
Because to be alone on the stage
is most challenging and most

00:25:43.130 --> 00:25:46.370
satisfying creative-wise.

00:25:46.370 --> 00:25:50.870
So [INAUDIBLE]
music is our life.

00:25:50.870 --> 00:25:53.540
Music is of our real expression.

00:25:53.540 --> 00:25:55.120
And we live in the
world of sound.

00:25:55.120 --> 00:25:56.620
SRIDHAR RAMASWAMY:
That's wonderful.

00:25:56.620 --> 00:25:57.300
It's wonderful.

00:25:57.300 --> 00:25:59.900
I have a question for you, Amji.

00:25:59.900 --> 00:26:01.550
You perform all
around the world,

00:26:01.550 --> 00:26:06.110
often to people that haven't
really heard the sarod before--

00:26:06.110 --> 00:26:08.150
for the first time.

00:26:08.150 --> 00:26:10.080
How do you connect
with your audiences?

00:26:10.080 --> 00:26:12.080
AMAAN ALI BANGASH: Well,
I think the first thing

00:26:12.080 --> 00:26:18.380
is to have a positive
attitude, never to believe--

00:26:18.380 --> 00:26:20.560
I would always want
to be a student.

00:26:20.560 --> 00:26:23.300
If I have bad days,
I have good days.

00:26:23.300 --> 00:26:27.740
But the audience, for me,
is a mirror of my being,

00:26:27.740 --> 00:26:29.060
in terms of--

00:26:29.060 --> 00:26:30.590
there's no point
getting an award

00:26:30.590 --> 00:26:32.045
and getting an empty house.

00:26:32.045 --> 00:26:34.680
I'd rather not get an award
and have a full house.

00:26:34.680 --> 00:26:37.700
So for me, I see God
through the audience,

00:26:37.700 --> 00:26:40.850
because that is the biggest
award a musician can get.

00:26:40.850 --> 00:26:44.330
And to play to a new audience
is always more challenging.

00:26:44.330 --> 00:26:45.770
But its also more fun.

00:26:45.770 --> 00:26:50.120
Because you can do certain
things that you cannot do when

00:26:50.120 --> 00:26:54.350
the, quote, unquote, "real"
connoisseurs are there.

00:26:54.350 --> 00:26:56.860
So it's a nice feeling.

00:26:56.860 --> 00:26:59.740
And you are, all the
time, constantly learning.

00:26:59.740 --> 00:27:02.270
And I don't take
myself very seriously.

00:27:02.270 --> 00:27:04.490
SRIDHAR RAMASWAMY:
That's wonderful.

00:27:04.490 --> 00:27:05.240
I have two sons.

00:27:05.240 --> 00:27:06.440
They're teenagers now.

00:27:06.440 --> 00:27:08.810
And I least my memory
of them growing up

00:27:08.810 --> 00:27:12.140
is doing various things with
them, whether it's puzzles

00:27:12.140 --> 00:27:13.520
or-- now they're 16 and 18.

00:27:13.520 --> 00:27:16.080
So we actually do programming
projects together.

00:27:16.080 --> 00:27:18.736
I'm a software engineer.

00:27:18.736 --> 00:27:19.860
Ayaan, you have young sons.

00:27:19.860 --> 00:27:20.990
Do you play with them?

00:27:20.990 --> 00:27:22.610
Or do you see them
becoming musicians?

00:27:22.610 --> 00:27:24.280
AYAAN ALI BANGASH:
Well, they're 5.

00:27:24.280 --> 00:27:24.900
SRIDHAR RAMASWAMY:
How old are they?

00:27:24.900 --> 00:27:25.280
Excuse me.

00:27:25.280 --> 00:27:26.821
AYAAN ALI BANGASH:
They're 5 and 1/2.

00:27:26.821 --> 00:27:29.280
They're twins-- Zohan and Abid.

00:27:29.280 --> 00:27:31.850
So while they seem to be
interested, right now,

00:27:31.850 --> 00:27:33.200
it's just a lot of noise.

00:27:33.200 --> 00:27:35.380
Because they have
two little sarods.

00:27:35.380 --> 00:27:37.350
And there's a lot of
strumming that happens.

00:27:37.350 --> 00:27:39.780
But then, they're
very fortunate.

00:27:39.780 --> 00:27:42.260
I've handed them over, at the
moment, to the grandfather.

00:27:42.260 --> 00:27:44.330
I said, the moment
they get somewhere,

00:27:44.330 --> 00:27:46.525
then I think I'll get in.

00:27:46.525 --> 00:27:47.900
But then, they're
very fortunate.

00:27:47.900 --> 00:27:50.675
Because, I think, they
also have this atmosphere

00:27:50.675 --> 00:27:51.550
of music around them.

00:27:51.550 --> 00:27:53.341
And music, actually,
is the greatest wealth

00:27:53.341 --> 00:27:55.020
that we have in our family.

00:27:55.020 --> 00:27:57.900
So I think, for us, it's a
way of life, not a profession.

00:27:57.900 --> 00:27:58.910
It's a passion.

00:27:58.910 --> 00:28:01.460
So I think it's not something
outside the box that's

00:28:01.460 --> 00:28:02.400
happening.

00:28:02.400 --> 00:28:04.612
But again, no pressure.

00:28:04.612 --> 00:28:06.320
They are free to do
what they want to do.

00:28:06.320 --> 00:28:09.740
But it's a long
journey for any--

00:28:09.740 --> 00:28:12.450
not just a classical
musician, but anyone creative.

00:28:12.450 --> 00:28:15.840
I think you need to have
the passion, the patience,

00:28:15.840 --> 00:28:17.930
the faith, the belief.

00:28:17.930 --> 00:28:22.457
And eventually, destiny has
its own plans sometimes.

00:28:22.457 --> 00:28:24.290
But anyway, they're
very fortunate that they

00:28:24.290 --> 00:28:27.100
have the grandfather.

00:28:27.100 --> 00:28:27.900
There's the uncle.

00:28:27.900 --> 00:28:28.700
There's the father.

00:28:28.700 --> 00:28:30.590
So there's a lot of
music around them.

00:28:30.590 --> 00:28:32.480
So they're enjoying
the attention.

00:28:32.480 --> 00:28:34.500
But let's see what happens.

00:28:34.500 --> 00:28:35.500
SRIDHAR RAMASWAMY: And--

00:28:35.500 --> 00:28:36.530
AYAAN ALI BANGASH: They
need your blessings--

00:28:36.530 --> 00:28:37.321
all your blessings.

00:28:37.321 --> 00:28:39.170
SRIDHAR RAMASWAMY: Oh,
they'll do very good.

00:28:39.170 --> 00:28:40.550
And when did the
two of you decided

00:28:40.550 --> 00:28:41.674
you wanted to be musicians?

00:28:41.674 --> 00:28:44.210
Do you remember a particular
point in time when you said,

00:28:44.210 --> 00:28:45.890
this is our calling?

00:28:45.890 --> 00:28:48.810
AMAAN ALI BANGASH: Well,
I was the mischievous one.

00:28:48.810 --> 00:28:51.520
I was not into music
till a certain age,

00:28:51.520 --> 00:28:54.710
though I was introduced to
the sarod and-- you know.

00:28:54.710 --> 00:28:58.580
By the time I was about 12,
13, I had a very bad show,

00:28:58.580 --> 00:29:02.730
where I saw my father,
actually, embarrassed of me.

00:29:02.730 --> 00:29:04.310
It was a show in London.

00:29:04.310 --> 00:29:06.710
And that's when, I
think, my world changed.

00:29:06.710 --> 00:29:11.917
I realized where God has sent
me and what I have to do.

00:29:11.917 --> 00:29:12.750
But then it became--

00:29:12.750 --> 00:29:14.592
AMJAD ALI KHAN: I had
fever on that night.

00:29:14.592 --> 00:29:15.074
AMAAN ALI BANGASH: Yeah.

00:29:15.074 --> 00:29:15.556
AYAAN ALI BANGASH: Yes.

00:29:15.556 --> 00:29:16.750
AMAAN ALI BANGASH: So
you know the pressures--

00:29:16.750 --> 00:29:18.647
AYAAN ALI BANGASH: It
Was as simple as that.

00:29:18.647 --> 00:29:20.480
AMAAN ALI BANGASH: So
especially when you're

00:29:20.480 --> 00:29:23.600
born to people like my father--

00:29:23.600 --> 00:29:24.707
so people do believe.

00:29:24.707 --> 00:29:26.540
And it's fair enough
for everyone to believe

00:29:26.540 --> 00:29:29.070
that the ride is much easier.

00:29:29.070 --> 00:29:31.750
But as they say,
there's no free lunches.

00:29:31.750 --> 00:29:33.080
There are none.

00:29:33.080 --> 00:29:36.140
Being born to people
like him, what happens

00:29:36.140 --> 00:29:39.740
is that, though you get
a lot of advantages,

00:29:39.740 --> 00:29:44.360
you get a lot of appreciation
and attention from people.

00:29:44.360 --> 00:29:46.400
I would have taken
another 20 years,

00:29:46.400 --> 00:29:49.940
I think, if I was not his
son, to reach whatever little

00:29:49.940 --> 00:29:53.090
or whatever-- achieved--
or I'm on my way.

00:29:53.090 --> 00:29:54.817
But the pressures are very high.

00:29:54.817 --> 00:29:56.150
SRIDHAR RAMASWAMY: Expectations.

00:29:56.150 --> 00:29:58.149
AMAAN ALI BANGASH: Yeah,
so I think, coming back

00:29:58.149 --> 00:29:59.230
to the question-- sorry.

00:29:59.230 --> 00:30:02.180
So when I saw that about
my father, I think,

00:30:02.180 --> 00:30:03.860
took life seriously.

00:30:03.860 --> 00:30:06.100
And I valued
education and sarod.

00:30:06.100 --> 00:30:08.570
And I knew that sarod
was the best that I had.

00:30:08.570 --> 00:30:10.684
Because tabla-- I
was very bad at it.

00:30:10.684 --> 00:30:12.350
SRIDHAR RAMASWAMY:
How about you, Ayaan?

00:30:12.350 --> 00:30:13.933
AYAAN ALI BANGASH:
Well, I don't think

00:30:13.933 --> 00:30:18.680
I had any defining
moment, so to speak.

00:30:18.680 --> 00:30:21.450
In the sense, I always knew
that this is what I want to do.

00:30:21.450 --> 00:30:23.154
This is what my
heart wanted to do.

00:30:23.154 --> 00:30:24.570
But obviously,
there was that time

00:30:24.570 --> 00:30:27.370
when I was just about
to finish high school

00:30:27.370 --> 00:30:30.770
and all my friends were
doing their Dartmouths

00:30:30.770 --> 00:30:32.720
and their Whartons and
Stanfords-- all that

00:30:32.720 --> 00:30:34.770
was happening-- their SATs.

00:30:34.770 --> 00:30:37.709
So that moment, that was just,
maybe, a temporary moment.

00:30:37.709 --> 00:30:38.750
I just questioned myself.

00:30:38.750 --> 00:30:41.027
Am I heading towards
the right direction?

00:30:41.027 --> 00:30:42.860
Because, the end of the
day, you don't know.

00:30:42.860 --> 00:30:45.230
You only know that
you don't know.

00:30:45.230 --> 00:30:48.290
So I actually, obviously,
internally thought about it.

00:30:48.290 --> 00:30:49.970
I spoke to my
parents, who've always

00:30:49.970 --> 00:30:56.000
been one of the most
influential people in my life.

00:30:56.000 --> 00:30:58.890
So they said, like
I said earlier,

00:30:58.890 --> 00:31:03.470
my father said, I shared
with both of you what

00:31:03.470 --> 00:31:05.720
was the greatest thing I had.

00:31:05.720 --> 00:31:08.690
And beyond this, he says that
I wouldn't have taught you

00:31:08.690 --> 00:31:12.540
if I didn't see you responding
to music in the right way.

00:31:12.540 --> 00:31:13.520
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:31:13.520 --> 00:31:14.730
I mean, I was no Mozart.

00:31:14.730 --> 00:31:18.690
But having said that,
it's a long journey.

00:31:18.690 --> 00:31:20.940
But the thing is, he said,
you are on the right track.

00:31:20.940 --> 00:31:23.180
And I think you should be
OK-- or you will be OK.

00:31:23.180 --> 00:31:25.400
So faith in the
guru, faith in God.

00:31:25.400 --> 00:31:28.080
And it's hard work.

00:31:28.080 --> 00:31:29.800
And it's just a long way.

00:31:29.800 --> 00:31:32.990
We're starting a new
journey every day.

00:31:32.990 --> 00:31:36.820
AMJAD ALI KHAN: I remember when
they were about 12-years-old,

00:31:36.820 --> 00:31:41.780
they came to me and
asked me, out of them,

00:31:41.780 --> 00:31:44.440
who should not play sarod.

00:31:44.440 --> 00:31:45.523
AYAAN ALI BANGASH: Did we?

00:31:45.523 --> 00:31:48.670
AMJAD ALI KHAN: So I
said, I'm just a guru.

00:31:48.670 --> 00:31:50.060
I'm not [INAUDIBLE].

00:31:50.060 --> 00:31:51.770
I'm not a god.

00:31:51.770 --> 00:31:56.060
If you have connection
with sound and rhythm,

00:31:56.060 --> 00:31:59.010
that means it's a wish of God
that you both should play sarod

00:31:59.010 --> 00:32:01.190
or you should be in the music.

00:32:01.190 --> 00:32:04.010
So you can't promote music.

00:32:04.010 --> 00:32:07.730
You can't-- it's
not a commodity.

00:32:07.730 --> 00:32:09.680
So it grows on you.

00:32:09.680 --> 00:32:14.000
And thank god we belong
to the world of sound.

00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:18.430
Because through sound, we
cannot manipulate our life.

00:32:18.430 --> 00:32:21.050
And the other world is language.

00:32:21.050 --> 00:32:23.630
With all due
respect to language,

00:32:23.630 --> 00:32:27.260
I often feel that language
could not create compassion

00:32:27.260 --> 00:32:29.410
and kindness in a human being.

00:32:29.410 --> 00:32:34.840
Even today, we are killing each
other on account of religion.

00:32:34.840 --> 00:32:36.140
It's very sad.

00:32:36.140 --> 00:32:39.470
And my father, he was not
teaching me only music

00:32:39.470 --> 00:32:41.840
but a complete way of life.

00:32:41.840 --> 00:32:45.530
And he often said that all
of us have a common god

00:32:45.530 --> 00:32:48.320
and we are the common race.

00:32:48.320 --> 00:32:50.930
Because I wish
this message should

00:32:50.930 --> 00:32:54.740
had been conveyed by all the
priests of all the religions.

00:32:54.740 --> 00:32:57.330
But every priest has
their own agenda.

00:32:57.330 --> 00:32:59.445
They are also getting
monthly salaries.

00:32:59.445 --> 00:33:02.030
More so, it is up to us.

00:33:02.030 --> 00:33:04.820
We have to realize how
we come to the world

00:33:04.820 --> 00:33:06.890
and how we go away
from this world.

00:33:06.890 --> 00:33:09.080
It's the same passage.

00:33:09.080 --> 00:33:12.334
So we are in the same race.

00:33:12.334 --> 00:33:14.250
SRIDHAR RAMASWAMY: That's
a wonderful message.

00:33:14.250 --> 00:33:16.700
AYAAN ALI BANGASH: And just on
another note, we are not twins.

00:33:16.700 --> 00:33:17.570
I just wanted to clarify.

that we are twins.

AMJAD ALI KHAN:
And also, I wanted

00:33:30.830 --> 00:33:35.450
to share that lot of people
compare Indian music with jazz

00:33:35.450 --> 00:33:37.400
music.

00:33:37.400 --> 00:33:39.560
Yes, jazz musicians
also improvise.

00:33:39.560 --> 00:33:41.480
But they have the
complete freedom

00:33:41.480 --> 00:33:44.660
to use all the 12 notes,
whenever they want.

00:33:44.660 --> 00:33:47.640
But we don't have
that kind of freedom.

00:33:47.640 --> 00:33:50.420
We have to improvise
within the set rule

00:33:50.420 --> 00:33:52.360
of ascending and descending.

00:33:52.360 --> 00:33:55.550
But improvisation is
not such a great thing.

00:33:55.550 --> 00:33:57.770
Even a child can improvise.

00:33:57.770 --> 00:34:00.560
Our salient features of
our Indian classical music

00:34:00.560 --> 00:34:03.140
is slides and glides.

00:34:03.140 --> 00:34:04.940
In Hindi, we call it [HINDI].

So ornamentation and
the slides and glides--

so now, music has
become therapy also.

00:34:33.260 --> 00:34:38.080
A lot of diseases can
be cured by music.

00:34:38.080 --> 00:34:39.980
And plants grow
faster with music.

Even cattles give
more milk by listening

00:34:42.650 --> 00:34:44.850
to certain kind of music.

What is your [INAUDIBLE]
routine like every day now?

00:34:55.395 --> 00:34:59.000
AMJAD ALI KHAN:
You see, earlier, I

00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:03.250
was giving more time,
sometimes, all night.

00:35:03.250 --> 00:35:05.090
And my father was
very, very old,

00:35:05.090 --> 00:35:09.020
because I was the youngest
child of their family.

00:35:09.020 --> 00:35:13.650
So I had elder
brothers and uncles.

00:35:13.650 --> 00:35:17.240
But the sense of
responsibility--

00:35:17.240 --> 00:35:20.590
for any child to realize
their responsibility

00:35:20.590 --> 00:35:23.262
is the greatest day
for the parents.

00:35:23.262 --> 00:35:25.800
So my father-- sometimes,
middle of the night,

00:35:25.800 --> 00:35:27.440
he saw me practicing--

00:35:27.440 --> 00:35:30.170
he will come and tell me,
[HINDI],, now go to sleep.

00:35:30.170 --> 00:35:31.840
So that was the father.

00:35:31.840 --> 00:35:35.330
But he was a hard
taskmaster while teaching.

00:35:35.330 --> 00:35:37.190
And he was very famous.

00:35:37.190 --> 00:35:39.350
He was very revered.

00:35:39.350 --> 00:35:41.735
And he got all the
awards and all that--

00:35:41.735 --> 00:35:45.980
but a saintly person,
committed to God

00:35:45.980 --> 00:35:48.670
and committed to
purity of music.

in the decades of you playing

AYAAN ALI BANGASH:
Well, of course,

00:36:30.500 --> 00:36:33.032
I can speak for my father
here, because the question was

00:36:33.032 --> 00:36:33.740
addressed to him.

00:36:33.740 --> 00:36:36.050
As a student, not
just as a son, I

00:36:36.050 --> 00:36:41.720
think he is one of those
masters in the field who

00:36:41.720 --> 00:36:44.780
have been extremely
progressive with the way

00:36:44.780 --> 00:36:47.570
he has gone about
his musical approach.

00:36:47.570 --> 00:36:52.410
If you hear my father in the
'60s or in the '70s, '80s,

00:36:52.410 --> 00:36:55.760
'90s now, I think, there,
you can see a journey.

00:36:55.760 --> 00:36:59.291
And you can see a
different thought process

00:36:59.291 --> 00:37:00.290
over the period of time.

00:37:00.290 --> 00:37:04.040
And today, my father's vision--

00:37:04.040 --> 00:37:06.440
I think he's playing
shorter pieces now.

00:37:06.440 --> 00:37:08.390
He's focusing more
on compositions.

00:37:08.390 --> 00:37:13.107
He's focusing more on
certain elements of music.

But I think, today, it's him
with that entire journey, which

00:37:23.260 --> 00:37:26.880
he's just sharing
with the world.

00:37:26.880 --> 00:37:30.240
And I think, it's just really
interesting to see that.

00:37:30.240 --> 00:37:33.170
And I think, yes, seeing
even the current situation,

00:37:33.170 --> 00:37:36.380
I don't think he's
made any compromises

00:37:36.380 --> 00:37:39.080
to the traditional
aspect of music.

00:37:39.080 --> 00:37:40.640
Because I don't
think any books said

00:37:40.640 --> 00:37:42.510
how to present classical music.

00:37:42.510 --> 00:37:45.740
I think he's done things a
little bit outside the box.

00:37:45.740 --> 00:37:49.700
And I think it's working very
well with the music lovers,

00:37:49.700 --> 00:37:50.850
as always.

00:37:50.850 --> 00:37:52.250
And this was not my question.

00:37:52.250 --> 00:37:53.816
So my father should answer.

00:37:53.816 --> 00:37:55.524
AMAAN ALI BANGASH:
And you should answer.

00:37:55.524 --> 00:37:56.900
He's our father.

00:37:56.900 --> 00:38:01.700
AMJAD ALI KHAN: You see, because
now the whole voice has become

00:38:01.700 --> 00:38:05.150
so intolerant and impatient.

00:38:05.150 --> 00:38:08.315
And everything should
happen quickly.

00:38:11.100 --> 00:38:15.150
People become musicians to
just perform or to create a CD

00:38:15.150 --> 00:38:18.270
or to go to a reality show.

00:38:18.270 --> 00:38:20.550
And most of the musicians
today, you see, they're

00:38:20.550 --> 00:38:22.530
all standing and performing--

00:38:22.530 --> 00:38:25.340
in such a rush, such a hurry.

00:38:25.340 --> 00:38:32.370
Our tradition is that we have
to sit and play and sing.

00:38:32.370 --> 00:38:37.800
And my father often said
that we must see good points

00:38:37.800 --> 00:38:40.200
at every system of
music, whether it

00:38:40.200 --> 00:38:43.710
is folk music, European
music, any music.

00:38:43.710 --> 00:38:48.030
And in our country, we have
so many states and regions.

00:38:48.030 --> 00:38:50.820
And through a line
of melody, a region

00:38:50.820 --> 00:38:53.300
can be introduced--
a folk music.

00:38:53.300 --> 00:38:55.420
The folk music of Rajasthan--

00:38:55.420 --> 00:38:57.920
[VOCALIZATION]

00:39:22.910 --> 00:39:25.220
So this is folk
music, most ancient.

00:39:25.220 --> 00:39:27.450
Because classical was created.

00:39:27.450 --> 00:39:30.200
It is formalized.

00:39:30.200 --> 00:39:32.580
It wasn't there in--

00:39:32.580 --> 00:39:36.260
so folk music, folk dance,
is the most original form

00:39:36.260 --> 00:39:38.900
of music of any country.

00:39:38.900 --> 00:39:41.480
And then, one day,
I received a message

00:39:41.480 --> 00:39:44.270
from Scottish Chamber Orchestra.

00:39:44.270 --> 00:39:48.200
They wanted me to write a
piece for their orchestra.

00:39:48.200 --> 00:39:52.320
And as we always say,
we don't read and write.

00:39:52.320 --> 00:39:56.510
So I sang in a CD all my
vision and expressions

00:39:56.510 --> 00:39:58.380
for the orchestra.

00:39:58.380 --> 00:40:01.280
Then, I found one conductor--
a British conductor.

00:40:01.280 --> 00:40:02.240
He knew my mind.

00:40:02.240 --> 00:40:03.800
So he wrote everything.

00:40:03.800 --> 00:40:05.990
So now, we have a written score.

00:40:05.990 --> 00:40:07.840
And the piece is
called Samaagam.

00:40:07.840 --> 00:40:11.270
Samaagam means
Conference of Culture.

00:40:11.270 --> 00:40:15.020
So many orchestras of the world,
they are playing my piece.

00:40:15.020 --> 00:40:18.390
This is the first sarod
concerto in the world.

00:40:18.390 --> 00:40:23.150
There are three of us play
with 60, 70 musicians around.

00:40:23.150 --> 00:40:27.950
And I hope, one day, we
could perform that orchestra,

00:40:27.950 --> 00:40:29.064
Samaagam, for you also.

00:40:29.064 --> 00:40:30.480
SRIDHAR RAMASWAMY:
That's amazing.

00:40:30.480 --> 00:40:32.430
That sounds like
an amazing treat.

00:40:32.430 --> 00:40:34.754
I think we have one more
video question from Jocelyn.

00:40:34.754 --> 00:40:35.420
Let's roll that.

00:40:38.370 --> 00:40:41.580
JOCELYN: Hello, I'm Jocelyn,
from Google, Mountain View.

00:40:41.580 --> 00:40:43.800
My team focuses on
building products

00:40:43.800 --> 00:40:46.270
for the emerging Indian market.

00:40:46.270 --> 00:40:48.880
We're so very honored to
have you with us here today.

00:40:48.880 --> 00:40:49.950
So thank you.

00:40:49.950 --> 00:40:51.110
My question is this.

00:40:51.110 --> 00:40:54.780
We here at Google are
very proud of Google Play.

00:40:54.780 --> 00:40:57.510
Has the digital music
industry changed the way

00:40:57.510 --> 00:40:59.010
you approach your craft?

00:40:59.010 --> 00:41:02.160
And how do you engage with
the millennial audience?

00:41:02.160 --> 00:41:04.620
Thank you.

00:41:04.620 --> 00:41:06.510
AMJAD ALI KHAN: Would
you like to talk some?

00:41:06.510 --> 00:41:11.070
AMAAN ALI BANGASH: Well, I think
it's more approachable today,

00:41:11.070 --> 00:41:14.052
thanks to the things
going digital.

00:41:14.052 --> 00:41:16.020
[INAUDIBLE] remember,
when we were growing up--

00:41:16.020 --> 00:41:17.880
we're still growing actually,
but when we were growing up

00:41:17.880 --> 00:41:19.260
and were much younger--

00:41:19.260 --> 00:41:23.307
we would battle with
other musicians,

00:41:23.307 --> 00:41:25.140
like, on a friendly--
give me that cassette.

00:41:25.140 --> 00:41:28.110
I'll give you that cassette,
that recording, or that LP,

00:41:28.110 --> 00:41:29.160
or that--

00:41:29.160 --> 00:41:31.631
or we would hide and
record sometimes,

00:41:31.631 --> 00:41:32.880
with that small tape recorder.

00:41:32.880 --> 00:41:34.980
Because that was
the access we would

00:41:34.980 --> 00:41:37.750
have to a musician's
vision of music.

00:41:37.750 --> 00:41:40.320
Today, it's so much
easier for people.

00:41:40.320 --> 00:41:42.870
Technically, I think
some musicians don't even

00:41:42.870 --> 00:41:44.316
have a guru now.

00:41:44.316 --> 00:41:47.070
The laptop is the
guru, in a good way.

00:41:47.070 --> 00:41:50.700
You press, I want
to learn Rag Kidara.

00:41:50.700 --> 00:41:52.230
You press that button.

00:41:52.230 --> 00:41:54.207
And you have 50,000
recordings coming out.

00:41:54.207 --> 00:41:55.290
AMJAD ALI KHAN: Of Kidara?

00:41:55.290 --> 00:41:57.030
AMAAN ALI BANGASH: Of Kidara--
of different musicians.

00:41:57.030 --> 00:41:58.630
So it's a good
thing, at some level.

00:41:58.630 --> 00:42:00.260
It's a good thing.

00:42:00.260 --> 00:42:04.245
And I think, for musicians,
it become a bit tough,

00:42:04.245 --> 00:42:06.890
not for people like him,
but for people like us.

00:42:06.890 --> 00:42:09.570
That when we have a
repertoire of ragas--

00:42:09.570 --> 00:42:12.070
let's say I know 25
ragas or 30 ragas.

00:42:12.070 --> 00:42:14.470
Now, someone is recording it.

00:42:14.470 --> 00:42:16.560
So today, I've played
here at Google.

00:42:16.560 --> 00:42:18.643
And let's say, tomorrow,
I'm playing, for example,

00:42:18.643 --> 00:42:19.680
at San Jose.

00:42:19.680 --> 00:42:22.950
I cannot repeat the same
rag or the same [INAUDIBLE],,

00:42:22.950 --> 00:42:25.072
because somebody
will record there.

00:42:25.072 --> 00:42:27.280
And you know, oh, this guy
doesn't have a repertoire.

00:42:27.280 --> 00:42:28.985
He has played [? daesh ?]
today-- rag daesh--

00:42:28.985 --> 00:42:30.734
and he's again playing
Rag Daesh tomorrow.

00:42:30.734 --> 00:42:32.070
So it's making us--

00:42:32.070 --> 00:42:33.420
everyone is on the edge.

00:42:33.420 --> 00:42:35.520
And everyone's actually
bringing their game up.

00:42:35.520 --> 00:42:38.010
Because there's
more transparency.

00:42:38.010 --> 00:42:39.250
And it's a good thing.

00:42:39.250 --> 00:42:40.458
I think it was changing and--

00:42:40.458 --> 00:42:44.350
AMJAD ALI KHAN: But I think,
you should not feel that way.

00:42:44.350 --> 00:42:47.240
You must know what is your best.

00:42:47.240 --> 00:42:49.055
You can play 100
times Rag Kidara.

00:42:49.055 --> 00:42:49.930
It will be different.

00:42:49.930 --> 00:42:50.350
AMAAN ALI BANGASH:
No, but I have

00:42:50.350 --> 00:42:51.475
other rags that I can play.

00:42:51.475 --> 00:42:52.577
So--

00:42:52.577 --> 00:42:54.160
AYAAN ALI BANGASH:
It's more difficult

00:42:54.160 --> 00:42:55.135
for stand-up comedians.

00:42:55.135 --> 00:42:56.300
They can't repeat their jokes.

00:42:56.300 --> 00:42:57.675
AMAAN ALI BANGASH:
Yeah, exactly.

00:42:57.675 --> 00:42:58.822
SRIDHAR RAMASWAMY: Right.

00:42:58.822 --> 00:43:00.280
AMJAD ALI KHAN:
Did you two think--

00:43:00.280 --> 00:43:03.760
actually, a great gift,
also, to all of us.

00:43:03.760 --> 00:43:07.100
And I'm proud of human beings
who have created mobile phones

00:43:07.100 --> 00:43:09.520
and iPads and all those--

00:43:09.520 --> 00:43:10.420
keyboard.

00:43:10.420 --> 00:43:13.540
The keyboard is a
amazing instrument

00:43:13.540 --> 00:43:18.310
that people can produce sound
of flute, sound of drum,

00:43:18.310 --> 00:43:20.134
and sitar, and so many--
violins and cello.

00:43:20.134 --> 00:43:21.550
AYAAN ALI BANGASH:
Not sarod yet--

00:43:21.550 --> 00:43:22.090
[INAUDIBLE]

00:43:22.090 --> 00:43:24.700
AMJAD ALI KHAN:
And not sarod yet.

00:43:24.700 --> 00:43:28.480
I'm sure, one day, we can hear
sarod also through keyboard.

00:43:28.480 --> 00:43:32.950
But our music-- classical
music-- has been documented,

00:43:32.950 --> 00:43:33.714
because of digi--

00:43:33.714 --> 00:43:35.130
AYAAN ALI BANGASH:
Digitalization.

00:43:35.130 --> 00:43:36.000
AMAAN ALI BANGASH:
Digitalization.

00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:37.650
AMJAD ALI KHAN:
--digitalization.

00:43:37.650 --> 00:43:43.930
So because we cannot perform
identical next concert the way

00:43:43.930 --> 00:43:47.770
we play, whatever we
have played today--

00:43:47.770 --> 00:43:50.230
again, if we play
the same pieces,

00:43:50.230 --> 00:43:52.460
the expression
would be different.

00:43:52.460 --> 00:43:56.530
So if we are recorded so you
can listen to it 1,000 times--

00:43:56.530 --> 00:44:01.360
and I feel that some
musicians boast about--

00:44:01.360 --> 00:44:05.080
they know 1,000
raga or 2,000 raga.

00:44:05.080 --> 00:44:08.410
But the great
maestros, they became

00:44:08.410 --> 00:44:11.229
famous because of 3-minutes
record-- that 78 RPM.

00:44:11.229 --> 00:44:12.270
SRIDHAR RAMASWAMY: Right.

00:44:12.270 --> 00:44:13.769
AMJAD ALI KHAN:
That three minutes--

00:44:13.769 --> 00:44:15.760
the music is the
name of quantity.

00:44:15.760 --> 00:44:18.430
It doesn't matter how
many ragas you know.

00:44:18.430 --> 00:44:23.450
But even if you know four
ragas which are appealing,

00:44:23.450 --> 00:44:26.740
which are soothing and
give you pleasure--

00:44:26.740 --> 00:44:29.680
so music should be appealing.

00:44:29.680 --> 00:44:33.341
And that is most important.

00:44:33.341 --> 00:44:35.590
SRIDHAR RAMASWAMY: Do you
have any audience questions?

00:44:35.590 --> 00:44:38.352
I have an endless list to ask.

00:44:38.352 --> 00:44:40.560
AMJAD ALI KHAN: Feel free
to us whatever you want to.

00:44:43.314 --> 00:44:46.390
AUDIENCE: [SANSKRIT]--

00:44:46.390 --> 00:44:48.520
AMJAD ALI KHAN: Just take
the mic down a little.

00:44:48.520 --> 00:44:51.250
AUDIENCE: Welcome
again to Google.

00:44:51.250 --> 00:44:56.575
So my question was, obviously,
music was in the family.

00:44:56.575 --> 00:45:00.150
You were introduced
very early on.

00:45:00.150 --> 00:45:02.680
And sarod was obvious
choice, probably.

00:45:02.680 --> 00:45:05.900
But do you play other
instruments for fun?

00:45:05.900 --> 00:45:08.157
Or just pick things up?

00:45:08.157 --> 00:45:09.490
AMAAN ALI BANGASH: It's for him?

00:45:09.490 --> 00:45:09.956
AUDIENCE: What do you play?

00:45:09.956 --> 00:45:10.422
AMJAD ALI KHAN: You should--

00:45:10.422 --> 00:45:11.338
AUDIENCE: For you two.

00:45:11.338 --> 00:45:12.950
And of course, [INAUDIBLE]

00:45:12.950 --> 00:45:14.650
AMJAD ALI KHAN: You
start from Ayaan.

00:45:14.650 --> 00:45:17.140
AYAAN ALI BANGASH: Well,
I can strum the guitar.

00:45:17.140 --> 00:45:18.850
I can just,
literally, play around

00:45:18.850 --> 00:45:21.490
with the guitar, because
I play the sarod.

00:45:21.490 --> 00:45:23.280
And when you have the
frets it's easier.

00:45:23.280 --> 00:45:25.180
I can play around
with the sitar.

00:45:25.180 --> 00:45:27.280
It's those fun moments.

00:45:27.280 --> 00:45:29.680
It's not something I'm proud of.

00:45:29.680 --> 00:45:32.650
But obviously, we've had--

00:45:32.650 --> 00:45:34.600
I can play some compositions.

00:45:34.600 --> 00:45:37.930
We've heard so much music of
all my father's contemporaries.

00:45:37.930 --> 00:45:40.600
So we know how they would
hold the instrument, how--

00:45:40.600 --> 00:45:43.017
these were our heroes, along
with my father, all his--

00:45:43.017 --> 00:45:44.350
AMJAD ALI KHAN: May I interrupt?

00:45:44.350 --> 00:45:45.135
AYAAN ALI BANGASH: --all
his contemporaries.

00:45:45.135 --> 00:45:45.635
Yes.

00:45:45.635 --> 00:45:47.360
AMJAD ALI KHAN:
From his childhood,

00:45:47.360 --> 00:45:49.024
he was interested in painting.

00:45:49.024 --> 00:45:50.440
AYAAN ALI BANGASH:
Well, that too.

00:45:50.440 --> 00:45:54.670
AMJAD ALI KHAN: So always
the images of Lord Ganesha.

00:45:54.670 --> 00:45:58.840
And even his [INAUDIBLE]--

00:45:58.840 --> 00:46:01.990
that is his passion also.

00:46:01.990 --> 00:46:04.080
And he's involved
in painting also.

00:46:04.080 --> 00:46:05.137
Yes, what about you?

00:46:05.137 --> 00:46:06.970
AMAAN ALI BANGASH: No--
so you were saying--

00:46:06.970 --> 00:46:07.320
AYAAN ALI BANGASH: No, no.

00:46:07.320 --> 00:46:08.920
So that's pretty much it-- yes.

00:46:08.920 --> 00:46:13.270
AMAAN ALI BANGASH: So I think
sarod was an obvious choice--

00:46:13.270 --> 00:46:15.100
sorry-- [INAUDIBLE]
was an obvious choice,

00:46:15.100 --> 00:46:16.657
because there was
so much around it.

00:46:16.657 --> 00:46:18.740
It's like, when you're in
the middle of the ocean,

00:46:18.740 --> 00:46:19.780
you have to swim.

00:46:19.780 --> 00:46:21.460
There's no other option.

00:46:21.460 --> 00:46:24.690
But I enjoy playing
the tabla a little bit.

00:46:24.690 --> 00:46:26.690
AYAAN ALI BANGASH: He
plays very well, actually.

00:46:26.690 --> 00:46:28.000
AMAAN ALI BANGASH: But just,
like, [INAUDIBLE] tabla,

00:46:28.000 --> 00:46:28.480
we call it.

00:46:28.480 --> 00:46:30.080
AYAAN ALI BANGASH: Yeah,
a sample sound check--

00:46:30.080 --> 00:46:30.410
AMAAN ALI BANGASH: I'm OK--

00:46:30.410 --> 00:46:31.240
AYAAN ALI BANGASH:
--we'll have in a moment.

00:46:31.240 --> 00:46:33.489
AMAAN ALI BANGASH: --with a
bit of piano and composing

00:46:33.489 --> 00:46:36.220
some sort of songs and
all, and a bit of santoor.

00:46:36.220 --> 00:46:38.170
So it's there, but
it's not something

00:46:38.170 --> 00:46:40.000
that I can do it in
front of all of you.

00:46:40.000 --> 00:46:41.422
But it's like, a
bathroom singer.

00:46:41.422 --> 00:46:43.130
AYAAN ALI BANGASH:
Private moments-- yes.

00:46:43.130 --> 00:46:45.460
AMAAN ALI BANGASH: But
sarod was an obvious choice.

00:46:45.460 --> 00:46:48.810
AMJAD ALI KHAN: And I was
so much involved with tabla.

00:46:48.810 --> 00:46:53.150
I used to play tabla as
a child, and so tabla

00:46:53.150 --> 00:46:54.280
that my father got worried.

00:46:54.280 --> 00:46:58.180
He thought I might become only
tabla player, not sarod player.

00:46:58.180 --> 00:47:01.450
So he hid the tabla
for a long time.

00:47:01.450 --> 00:47:03.560
AMAAN ALI BANGASH:
He was tabla sick.

00:47:03.560 --> 00:47:05.830
AMJAD ALI KHAN: But
I'm so much involved.

00:47:05.830 --> 00:47:08.010
I enjoy playing tabla
in my free time.

00:47:08.010 --> 00:47:10.210
And I compose also--

00:47:10.210 --> 00:47:13.900
songs, [INAUDIBLE],, and
music for the ballet,

00:47:13.900 --> 00:47:15.820
music for the orchestra.

00:47:15.820 --> 00:47:19.570
And it's very interesting
how the industry works--

00:47:19.570 --> 00:47:22.605
even in Bombay,
film or Bollywood--

00:47:22.605 --> 00:47:25.240
that first, there is a tune.

00:47:25.240 --> 00:47:27.340
That tune is sent
to the lyricist.

00:47:27.340 --> 00:47:29.530
And then he wires the words.

00:47:29.530 --> 00:47:32.156
Like, I composed one song--

00:47:32.156 --> 00:47:55.130
[VOCALIZATION] So this is the
[INAUDIBLE] the first piece.

00:47:55.130 --> 00:47:57.767
And the lyricist wrote--

00:47:57.767 --> 00:47:59.100
AMAAN ALI BANGASH: [INAUDIBLE]--

00:47:59.100 --> 00:48:02.050
AYAAN ALI BANGASH: I don't
remember the words-- yeah.

00:48:02.050 --> 00:48:03.570
AMJAD ALI KHAN: "Dun"--

00:48:03.570 --> 00:48:05.550
anyway, so this is the--

00:48:08.690 --> 00:48:12.090
we always forget the language,
the words, the lyrics.

00:48:12.090 --> 00:48:17.610
Because our life is
full of sound and music.

00:48:17.610 --> 00:48:20.970
And in our traditional
families, we

00:48:20.970 --> 00:48:24.690
were not allowed
to plan our future.

00:48:24.690 --> 00:48:26.670
It's an unwise thing to do.

00:48:26.670 --> 00:48:30.700
But that is the commitment
the guru demands, that one

00:48:30.700 --> 00:48:32.170
has to surrender to gurus.

00:48:32.170 --> 00:48:34.420
One has to surrender to God.

00:48:34.420 --> 00:48:36.700
And rest-- leave it to God.

00:48:36.700 --> 00:48:38.840
We don't know what is
going to happen tomorrow.

00:48:38.840 --> 00:48:42.540
So there was our way of life
of Indian classical musicians.

00:48:42.540 --> 00:48:45.490
It's almost like entering
into a dark tunnel

00:48:45.490 --> 00:48:48.760
with the hope of
sun-rays someday.

00:48:48.760 --> 00:48:50.920
So very few can make it.

00:48:50.920 --> 00:48:55.630
And there are thousands of
musicians in that journey.

00:48:55.630 --> 00:49:01.760
But my father--
we depend on God.

00:49:01.760 --> 00:49:07.240
And so whatever has happened,
with the love and blessings

00:49:07.240 --> 00:49:10.330
of the people of India,
people of the world,

00:49:10.330 --> 00:49:12.220
people who love music--

00:49:12.220 --> 00:49:15.910
and I'm grateful to
God that Amaan, Ayaan--

00:49:15.910 --> 00:49:18.382
they are so committed
and dedicated.

00:49:18.382 --> 00:49:19.840
And they are very
fortunate to have

00:49:19.840 --> 00:49:22.510
a mother like Subhalakshmi.

00:49:22.510 --> 00:49:26.260
My wife, she was a very
famous Bharatanatyam dancer.

00:49:26.260 --> 00:49:29.110
And because we both are
unemployed parents-- so we

00:49:29.110 --> 00:49:30.605
gave a lot of time to them.

00:49:30.605 --> 00:49:32.980
AMAAN ALI BANGASH: Basically,
the answer to your question

00:49:32.980 --> 00:49:35.522
is, we didn't have a
choice with the sarod.

00:49:35.522 --> 00:49:37.682
Yeah.

00:49:37.682 --> 00:49:40.215
AUDIENCE: Hello, sir,
long back in an interview,

00:49:40.215 --> 00:49:43.710
I'd seen that while training
Amaan and Ayaan, when you were

00:49:43.710 --> 00:49:45.550
traveling, probably,
you would hum a tune,

00:49:45.550 --> 00:49:47.720
and they wouldn't map
the [INAUDIBLE] to it.

00:49:47.720 --> 00:49:48.080
AMJAD ALI KHAN: Yes.

00:49:48.080 --> 00:49:48.850
AUDIENCE: Can you still do that?

00:49:48.850 --> 00:49:51.100
And if possible, can
we have a demo of that?

00:49:51.100 --> 00:49:54.070
AMJAD ALI KHAN: You're putting
us through a test again.

00:49:54.070 --> 00:49:55.745
AUDIENCE: Because I was in awe
when I saw that [INAUDIBLE]..

00:49:55.745 --> 00:49:57.619
So yeah, I don't mind
being awe-struck again.

00:49:57.619 --> 00:49:59.250
AMJAD ALI KHAN:
You see, every guru

00:49:59.250 --> 00:50:01.510
has a different way of teaching.

00:50:01.510 --> 00:50:07.660
But I feel that, more than the
language or lyrics and text,

00:50:07.660 --> 00:50:11.530
if you are a musician, you must
be connected with the sound

00:50:11.530 --> 00:50:12.370
first.

00:50:12.370 --> 00:50:14.110
Like-- Ayaan--

00:50:14.110 --> 00:50:40.150
[TARANA SINGING,
CALL &amp; RESPONSE]

00:50:40.150 --> 00:50:42.257
AMAAN ALI BANGASH: Why
did you ask this question?

00:50:42.257 --> 00:50:44.506
AMJAD ALI KHAN: We need to
do some questions with you.

00:50:47.978 --> 00:50:49.970
AUDIENCE: Thank you so much.

00:50:49.970 --> 00:50:51.950
AMJAD ALI KHAN: It's
like Musical Quiz.

00:50:51.950 --> 00:50:53.670
AYAAN ALI BANGASH: [INAUDIBLE]

00:50:53.670 --> 00:50:54.711
AMJAD ALI KHAN: So then--

00:50:54.711 --> 00:50:57.620
AYAAN ALI BANGASH: We
haven't done this in a while.

00:50:57.620 --> 00:50:59.940
AMJAD ALI KHAN: As children,
they used to do that.

00:50:59.940 --> 00:51:04.402
Now, we communicate
through instruments only.

00:51:04.402 --> 00:51:05.485
SRIDHAR RAMASWAMY: Please.

00:51:05.485 --> 00:51:08.100
AUDIENCE: Earlier, you mentioned
that your guru would ask

00:51:08.100 --> 00:51:10.290
you to surrender to the music.

00:51:10.290 --> 00:51:12.190
Those are the kind
of gurus that day.

00:51:12.190 --> 00:51:15.450
But I think, nowadays, it's hard
to find those kind of gurus.

00:51:15.450 --> 00:51:18.060
It's mostly, like, for earning.

00:51:18.060 --> 00:51:18.975
Any tips on that?

00:51:18.975 --> 00:51:22.174
Like, how to get a good
guru and get into the music?

00:51:22.174 --> 00:51:22.840
Yeah-- any tips?

00:51:22.840 --> 00:51:26.520
AMJAD ALI KHAN: There are
lots of gurus all over India,

00:51:26.520 --> 00:51:28.680
all over the world.

00:51:28.680 --> 00:51:31.800
The point is, in our
country, a learned,

00:51:31.800 --> 00:51:37.780
learned man was
considered a institution.

00:51:37.780 --> 00:51:43.510
And now, a huge cemented
building is called institution.

00:51:43.510 --> 00:51:47.350
So that is the basic difference.

00:51:47.350 --> 00:51:50.890
The institution, that
knowledgeable man--

00:51:50.890 --> 00:51:52.360
they used to be very demanding.

00:51:52.360 --> 00:51:57.070
And some gurus were very
sincere to their disciples.

00:51:57.070 --> 00:51:59.470
And some gurus are
not very sincere.

00:51:59.470 --> 00:52:01.480
We have a history
of the [INAUDIBLE]----

00:52:01.480 --> 00:52:02.850
AMAAN ALI BANGASH: That's right.

00:52:02.850 --> 00:52:03.140
AMJAD ALI KHAN: --and--

00:52:03.140 --> 00:52:04.120
AYAAN ALI BANGASH:
And [INAUDIBLE]----

00:52:04.120 --> 00:52:04.360
AMAAN ALI BANGASH: [INAUDIBLE]--

00:52:04.360 --> 00:52:05.526
AMJAD ALI KHAN: [INAUDIBLE].

00:52:05.526 --> 00:52:07.652
AMAAN ALI BANGASH: [INAUDIBLE].

00:52:07.652 --> 00:52:09.610
AMJAD ALI KHAN: So we
have that kind of history

00:52:09.610 --> 00:52:17.260
that, sometimes, guru is not
very partial or impartial.

00:52:17.260 --> 00:52:19.870
So some students
become more favorite.

00:52:19.870 --> 00:52:24.000
Some students-- they
don't want to teach them.

00:52:24.000 --> 00:52:25.930
But it's very,
very, very important

00:52:25.930 --> 00:52:30.542
to have right kind of
guidance and gurus.

00:52:30.542 --> 00:52:32.750
AMAAN ALI BANGASH: But no,
he was asking-- if I may--

00:52:32.750 --> 00:52:34.640
how to find a guru.

00:52:34.640 --> 00:52:36.800
AYAAN ALI BANGASH: You
can, of course, Google it.

00:52:36.800 --> 00:52:38.220
That's one thing.

00:52:38.220 --> 00:52:40.004
But no, seriously-- I think--

00:52:40.004 --> 00:52:41.420
AMJAD ALI KHAN:
Now, it is, people

00:52:41.420 --> 00:52:42.545
are teaching through Skype.

00:52:42.545 --> 00:52:44.003
AYAAN ALI BANGASH:
On that, I think

00:52:44.003 --> 00:52:45.710
it depends as to
where you want to go.

00:52:45.710 --> 00:52:47.400
Say, if you're learning
for the love of music,

00:52:47.400 --> 00:52:47.840
that's one thing.

00:52:47.840 --> 00:52:49.990
If you're learning because
it's a passion, it's one thing.

00:52:49.990 --> 00:52:52.490
If you're learning because you
want to make a profession out

00:52:52.490 --> 00:52:53.930
of this, then
that's another way.

00:52:53.930 --> 00:52:56.150
Then you have to learn
the way it was learned.

00:52:56.150 --> 00:52:57.900
You have to go to a teacher.

00:52:57.900 --> 00:53:00.920
You have to be a part
of that teacher's life

00:53:00.920 --> 00:53:03.000
and be around your
teacher and learn.

00:53:03.000 --> 00:53:05.950
But obviously, online
classes are happening now.

00:53:05.950 --> 00:53:07.231
It's also convenience.

00:53:07.231 --> 00:53:08.980
A lot of people have
passion, but they are

00:53:08.980 --> 00:53:10.420
unable to take that time out.

00:53:10.420 --> 00:53:14.610
So there are so many kinds
of gurus available now.

00:53:14.610 --> 00:53:16.325
But it depends which,
I think, direction

00:53:16.325 --> 00:53:17.780
you want to head towards.

00:53:17.780 --> 00:53:18.830
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:53:18.830 --> 00:53:21.710
AMJAD ALI KHAN:
Very few students

00:53:21.710 --> 00:53:26.770
are learning music
to understand music

00:53:26.770 --> 00:53:29.200
and to understand the
depth of the music.

00:53:29.200 --> 00:53:32.470
Because most of the
learners, the students,

00:53:32.470 --> 00:53:36.040
young performers-- they all
want to perform on the stage.

00:53:36.040 --> 00:53:40.030
So this impatientness to
be on the stage, that's

00:53:40.030 --> 00:53:42.600
the greatest destruction.

00:53:42.600 --> 00:53:46.166
It's a tragedy of music.

00:53:46.166 --> 00:53:47.540
SRIDHAR RAMASWAMY:
Well, we could

00:53:47.540 --> 00:53:49.600
do this for a very long time.

00:53:49.600 --> 00:53:51.080
But our time is up.

00:53:51.080 --> 00:53:53.570
It's not often that
one has the privilege

00:53:53.570 --> 00:53:57.020
to be right next to a
living legend of India.

00:53:57.020 --> 00:53:59.050
Khansa, Amaan, Ayaan--
thank you all so much.

00:53:59.050 --> 00:53:59.200
AYAAN ALI BANGASH: Thank you.

00:53:59.200 --> 00:53:59.600
AMAAN ALI BANGASH:
Thank you for having us.

00:53:59.600 --> 00:53:59.890
AMJAD ALI KHAN: Thank you.

00:53:59.890 --> 00:54:01.431
AYAAN ALI BANGASH:
Thank you so much.

00:54:01.431 --> 00:54:03.540
[APPLAUSE]
