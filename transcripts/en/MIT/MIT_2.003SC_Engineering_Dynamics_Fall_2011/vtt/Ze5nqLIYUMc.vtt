00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:26.250
PROFESSOR: OK, let's talk
about the important thoughts

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:27.625
for the week,
important concepts.

00:00:30.442 --> 00:00:31.150
What do you have?

00:00:33.928 --> 00:00:35.317
AUDIENCE: Energy method.

00:00:35.317 --> 00:00:36.706
PROFESSOR: Energy method.

00:00:36.706 --> 00:00:40.745
I'm going to say this
work energy theorem.

00:00:54.820 --> 00:01:01.053
And from that, these turn out
to be our potential energies.

00:01:16.481 --> 00:01:20.610
And this minus the work done
by the conservative forces

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:23.890
we call V2 minus V1.

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:26.870
That's the change in the
potential energy of the system.

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:28.380
So that's the work
energy theorem.

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.250
That's an important
one for the week.

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:30.750
What else?

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:43.370
AUDIENCE: Different
types of problems.

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:45.870
PROFESSOR: Yeah, we did
several example problem

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:47.120
particularly emphasizing what?

00:01:52.669 --> 00:01:54.335
AUDIENCE: With respect
to moving points?

00:01:54.335 --> 00:01:57.202
PROFESSOR: Yeah, or points
that look like they're moving.

00:01:57.202 --> 00:02:00.020
But you can use
special considerations

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:03.360
in calling them instantaneous
centers of rotation and things

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:07.560
like that, so summation of the
torques with respect to points

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:18.030
sometimes moving defined with
respect to ICRs, Instantaneous

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:24.250
Centers of Rotation,
and also moving points.

00:02:27.365 --> 00:02:29.410
We definitely did some of that.

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:30.320
How about a third?

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:48.820
I'd say one more thing
that we got started on

00:02:48.820 --> 00:03:07.710
is expressions-- 1/2 i, 1/2
omega dot h plus 1/2 mv, v dot

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:09.730
v, those kind of terms for this.

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:14.229
And for potential energy, if
it's purely mechanical devices,

00:03:14.229 --> 00:03:15.770
we have two kinds
of potential energy

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:17.020
that we'll be dealing with.

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:24.000
And they are associated
with springs and gravity.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:25.970
So that's the two
we'll deal with.

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:27.836
Are there others?

00:03:27.836 --> 00:03:30.210
What's an example of a different
kind of potential energy

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:31.643
that you might run into?

00:03:31.643 --> 00:03:32.550
AUDIENCE: Magnetic.

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:33.985
PROFESSOR: Magnetic
fields, yeah.

00:03:33.985 --> 00:03:36.850
We can do work pulling something
out of a magnetic field.

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:37.420
What else?

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:38.100
AUDIENCE: Electric fields.

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:39.570
PROFESSOR: Electric
fields, sure.

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:41.230
But they do have
their complications.

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:45.370
So that's pretty
good for the week.

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:52.990
Now, we're going to
talk about this problem.

00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:54.770
I'll give him a
chance to shoot it.

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:56.210
This is a good diagram of it.

00:03:56.210 --> 00:04:00.570
You guys had a homework problem
that instead of a uniform rod,

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:06.820
you had a concentrated mass
on the end of a massless rod.

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:09.690
So this is almost
identical to that.

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:15.530
But we now have actual mass,
distributed mass, in the stick.

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:20.579
I've got a little demo
here, which will work,

00:04:20.579 --> 00:04:21.760
works after a fashion.

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:27.030
Put a little tension
on these springs,

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:29.740
so now I've got my
cart on a spring.

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:31.390
The damping is
natural in the system,

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:34.154
comes from the wheels
and everything else.

00:04:34.154 --> 00:04:36.070
I've got to get this
kind of close to the edge

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:36.880
so it'll work.

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:44.020
This thing has two natural
frequencies actually.

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:46.790
They're kind of hard
to isolate them.

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:51.300
There's one-- no, can't do it.

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:54.590
In one natural mode,
the thing swings forward

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:56.540
and moves forward together.

00:04:56.540 --> 00:04:59.135
And in the other natural mode,
this'll go aft, that way,

00:04:59.135 --> 00:05:00.760
while the other one's
going frontwards.

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:03.220
So let's see if I can--
that's higher frequency.

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:07.480
That's the motion of what's
called the second mode,

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:08.300
opposite.

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:11.720
And the first mode is
lower frequency than that.

00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:28.010
It's hard to get a
perfect start to it.

00:05:28.010 --> 00:05:31.010
So this is the kind of
motion we're talking about.

00:05:31.010 --> 00:05:33.530
And we're going to
have you help me solve.

00:05:33.530 --> 00:05:37.910
We want to obtain equations
of motion for this system.

00:05:37.910 --> 00:05:41.890
And let's quickly run
through the exercise of-- you

00:05:41.890 --> 00:05:43.814
can do this intuitively
first, it's so simple.

00:05:43.814 --> 00:05:44.980
Plus you've already done it.

00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:48.240
How many independent coordinates
does it take to do it?

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:57.150
Two, and how many rigid bodies
are there in this problem?

00:05:57.150 --> 00:05:59.140
How many rigid bodies
in the problem?

00:06:02.932 --> 00:06:03.806
AUDIENCE: Two.

00:06:03.806 --> 00:06:05.430
PROFESSOR: There's
gotta be two, right?

00:06:05.430 --> 00:06:07.250
There's a block that
moves back and forth,

00:06:07.250 --> 00:06:08.970
and there's this
rod that swings.

00:06:08.970 --> 00:06:11.380
So the number of degrees of
freedom, we'll call it d,

00:06:11.380 --> 00:06:15.260
is 6 times the number of bodies.

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:18.270
n is the number bodies minus
the number of constraints.

00:06:18.270 --> 00:06:21.330
So this is 6 times 2
minus the constraints.

00:06:21.330 --> 00:06:23.870
So we've got 12 minus c.

00:06:23.870 --> 00:06:25.860
And you know the answers.

00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:29.150
The answer, how many independent
coordinates to completely

00:06:29.150 --> 00:06:30.237
describe this motion?

00:06:30.237 --> 00:06:30.820
AUDIENCE: Two.

00:06:30.820 --> 00:06:31.819
PROFESSOR: Just the two.

00:06:31.819 --> 00:06:34.135
So you know the answer is two.

00:06:34.135 --> 00:06:36.380
So that means you've
got to come up with 10,

00:06:36.380 --> 00:06:37.940
a list of 10 of these things.

00:06:37.940 --> 00:06:42.250
So let's see if you can write
down quickly your own list.

00:06:42.250 --> 00:06:47.370
How would you eliminate through
coming up with constraints?

00:06:47.370 --> 00:06:49.420
Write down the 10 constraints.

00:06:49.420 --> 00:06:52.720
And I recommend you do it by
taking one body at a time.

00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:56.824
So constraints on mass one, the
first block, what do you got?

00:06:56.824 --> 00:06:59.610
AUDIENCE: y, y dot, and
y double dot equal 0.

00:06:59.610 --> 00:07:02.200
PROFESSOR: OK, so that says
no motion in the y direction.

00:07:02.200 --> 00:07:03.815
Because we're on rollers.

00:07:03.815 --> 00:07:06.670
It's fixed that way,
so no motion in the y.

00:07:06.670 --> 00:07:07.629
What else?

00:07:07.629 --> 00:07:08.670
AUDIENCE: No motion in z.

00:07:08.670 --> 00:07:09.030
PROFESSOR: No motion in z.

00:07:09.030 --> 00:07:11.430
We're telling it it can't
come in and out of the board.

00:07:11.430 --> 00:07:15.190
OK, any other translational
constraints on that one?

00:07:15.190 --> 00:07:21.685
So no y or z translation.

00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:26.470
And so that gives us
two constraints there.

00:07:26.470 --> 00:07:28.030
What else on that body?

00:07:28.030 --> 00:07:29.620
AUDIENCE: No rotations.

00:07:29.620 --> 00:07:31.370
PROFESSOR: No rotations
in what direction?

00:07:31.370 --> 00:07:32.210
AUDIENCE: x, y, or z.

00:07:32.210 --> 00:07:33.251
PROFESSOR: In x, y, or z.

00:07:33.251 --> 00:07:39.980
The thing can only translate,
so no x, y, z rotations.

00:07:42.920 --> 00:07:43.540
That's three.

00:07:43.540 --> 00:07:45.510
So that's a total of five.

00:07:45.510 --> 00:07:46.620
But we have one left.

00:07:46.620 --> 00:07:48.600
It's got to be able
to move in the x.

00:07:48.600 --> 00:07:51.710
And how about M2?

00:07:51.710 --> 00:07:55.786
What are the constraints
on the second one?

00:07:55.786 --> 00:07:58.030
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:07:58.030 --> 00:07:59.400
PROFESSOR: So one at a time.

00:07:59.400 --> 00:08:00.275
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:08:02.950 --> 00:08:04.840
PROFESSOR: So omega which?

00:08:04.840 --> 00:08:06.010
AUDIENCE: x and y.

00:08:06.010 --> 00:08:09.986
PROFESSOR: No rotations
about which axes?

00:08:09.986 --> 00:08:10.820
AUDIENCE: x and y.

00:08:10.820 --> 00:08:13.683
PROFESSOR: So you're saying no
rotations of this about the x.

00:08:13.683 --> 00:08:15.340
So it can't roll over.

00:08:15.340 --> 00:08:17.960
About the y, it can't turn.

00:08:17.960 --> 00:08:20.260
And about the z.

00:08:20.260 --> 00:08:22.756
But we're doing this one.

00:08:22.756 --> 00:08:24.380
So it's no spinning
about-- let's do it

00:08:24.380 --> 00:08:25.550
in its body coordinates.

00:08:25.550 --> 00:08:30.070
x1-- no spinning about x1.

00:08:30.070 --> 00:08:33.120
No spinning about y1.

00:08:33.120 --> 00:08:35.679
But can it rotate around z1?

00:08:35.679 --> 00:08:47.310
OK, so for the second mass,
we have no x1, y1 rotations.

00:08:47.310 --> 00:08:48.100
That's two.

00:08:48.100 --> 00:08:50.180
And what about translations
on the second body?

00:08:53.916 --> 00:08:54.850
Hmm?

00:08:54.850 --> 00:08:56.730
AUDIENCE: No
translations x, y, and z.

00:08:56.730 --> 00:08:58.380
PROFESSOR: No
translations x, y, and z.

00:08:58.380 --> 00:09:01.320
So z, pretty obvious-- we're
not letting it do this.

00:09:01.320 --> 00:09:07.136
But why can you argue there's
no translation in x and y?

00:09:07.136 --> 00:09:10.608
AUDIENCE: Because it's
strictly rotation.

00:09:10.608 --> 00:09:13.856
PROFESSOR: You say
it's strictly rotation.

00:09:13.856 --> 00:09:17.994
AUDIENCE: For it to
translate [INAUDIBLE].

00:09:17.994 --> 00:09:19.785
PROFESSOR: OK, so you're
saying translation

00:09:19.785 --> 00:09:22.680
is strictly described
as parallel motion

00:09:22.680 --> 00:09:24.980
of all points on it.

00:09:24.980 --> 00:09:27.915
But where is it
constrained in x and y?

00:09:27.915 --> 00:09:30.532
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:09:30.532 --> 00:09:31.990
PROFESSOR: It's
pinned to the cart.

00:09:31.990 --> 00:09:34.240
And if you fix x, which
you're allowed to do,

00:09:34.240 --> 00:09:36.712
a test you're allowed
to do, you have set this

00:09:36.712 --> 00:09:37.920
as an independent coordinate.

00:09:37.920 --> 00:09:41.230
If you fix it, this
point is fixed.

00:09:41.230 --> 00:09:44.780
And you've constrained
it in x and y.

00:09:44.780 --> 00:09:48.100
And if any point in the object
is constrained in x and y,

00:09:48.100 --> 00:09:54.590
then all points are constrained
in x and y pure translation.

00:09:54.590 --> 00:10:02.035
So we have in this one no
x, y, and z translations.

00:10:04.610 --> 00:10:05.520
So that's three.

00:10:05.520 --> 00:10:06.880
You add them up, you get 10.

00:10:06.880 --> 00:10:08.590
OK, good.

00:10:08.590 --> 00:10:12.720
Now, the next thing
I want you to do,

00:10:12.720 --> 00:10:16.320
another key step in
doing problems like this,

00:10:16.320 --> 00:10:17.930
is our free body diagrams.

00:10:17.930 --> 00:10:20.850
And how many do you need?

00:10:20.850 --> 00:10:27.525
As many as you
have rigid bodies.

00:10:27.525 --> 00:10:30.400
You need one for
every rigid body.

00:10:30.400 --> 00:10:32.030
So we got two rigid bodies.

00:10:32.030 --> 00:10:41.770
Draw for me your free
body diagram for the cart

00:10:41.770 --> 00:10:44.265
and for the rod.

00:11:16.930 --> 00:11:20.830
OK, what group wants
to volunteer here,

00:11:20.830 --> 00:11:23.319
tell me what I ought to do?

00:11:23.319 --> 00:11:24.610
How about you guys in the back?

00:11:24.610 --> 00:11:26.330
You're quite today.

00:11:26.330 --> 00:11:29.460
So pick this first one.

00:11:29.460 --> 00:11:33.880
AUDIENCE: You have the
spring force kx to the left.

00:11:33.880 --> 00:11:35.002
PROFESSOR: kx.

00:11:35.002 --> 00:11:36.970
AUDIENCE: Also bx dot.

00:11:36.970 --> 00:11:38.710
PROFESSOR: bx dot.

00:11:38.710 --> 00:11:40.570
AUDIENCE: Normal force up.

00:11:40.570 --> 00:11:41.487
PROFESSOR: N.

00:11:41.487 --> 00:11:46.844
AUDIENCE: You have M1g down,
and then the force of the rod

00:11:46.844 --> 00:11:48.305
is down and to the right.

00:11:48.305 --> 00:11:52.155
PROFESSOR: Oh, so you've made--
ahh, colinear with the rod?

00:11:52.155 --> 00:11:52.780
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:11:52.780 --> 00:11:54.490
PROFESSOR: OK, so
you're saying we've

00:11:54.490 --> 00:11:59.000
got a vector force like
that, some F, right?

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:02.240
OK, how about a
little help on this.

00:12:02.240 --> 00:12:06.994
Anybody have a different
result here for this one?

00:12:06.994 --> 00:12:10.930
AUDIENCE: I broke up my
normal into two [INAUDIBLE].

00:12:10.930 --> 00:12:13.950
PROFESSOR: So you
have two pieces here?

00:12:13.950 --> 00:12:17.712
So in what direction
do you draw them?

00:12:17.712 --> 00:12:20.060
AUDIENCE: Reaction force of
the first failed reaction?

00:12:20.060 --> 00:12:22.750
PROFESSOR: I guess
which coordinate system?

00:12:22.750 --> 00:12:27.260
We need two coordinate systems
to define this problem.

00:12:27.260 --> 00:12:29.140
AUDIENCE: Just in
the regular x, y.

00:12:29.140 --> 00:12:34.100
PROFESSOR: So I've got
an inertial frame here.

00:12:34.100 --> 00:12:37.720
And that gives me my X,
capital X, motion for this guy.

00:12:37.720 --> 00:12:40.000
But we need, because if we
want to be able to moments

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:43.550
of inertia and things like that,
a coordinate system attached

00:12:43.550 --> 00:12:45.440
to this rigid body, right?

00:12:45.440 --> 00:12:48.990
So I've called it little x1,
y1, and it moves with the body.

00:12:48.990 --> 00:12:52.130
OK, so you've picked
your two reaction

00:12:52.130 --> 00:12:57.094
forces aligned with these two
or aligned in this system?

00:12:57.094 --> 00:12:59.360
AUDIENCE: With the inertial.

00:12:59.360 --> 00:13:01.300
PROFESSOR: OK, you've
done it this way.

00:13:01.300 --> 00:13:03.010
So you're coming up
with a pair of forces

00:13:03.010 --> 00:13:07.198
that have a piece like
this and a piece like that?

00:13:07.198 --> 00:13:11.011
AUDIENCE: No, I'm talking
about for the wheels.

00:13:11.011 --> 00:13:12.260
PROFESSOR: Oh, for the wheels.

00:13:12.260 --> 00:13:13.930
Oh, OK.

00:13:13.930 --> 00:13:15.750
You came up with
individual ones here?

00:13:15.750 --> 00:13:17.530
Yeah, OK.

00:13:17.530 --> 00:13:20.390
I'll call that N1 and N2.

00:13:20.390 --> 00:13:23.520
And that's probably
an improvement.

00:13:23.520 --> 00:13:26.210
Because that's what keeps
it from rolling over.

00:13:26.210 --> 00:13:28.780
OK, that's true.

00:13:28.780 --> 00:13:29.990
And what else?

00:13:29.990 --> 00:13:32.892
So you've got a reaction
force here like that.

00:13:32.892 --> 00:13:33.850
Can we improve on that?

00:13:36.670 --> 00:13:39.960
AUDIENCE: You can break it up
into tangential and radial.

00:13:39.960 --> 00:13:41.470
PROFESSOR: Yeah,
but I understood.

00:13:41.470 --> 00:13:44.570
The intention here was
it was drawn colinear

00:13:44.570 --> 00:13:47.290
with the axis of the thing.

00:13:47.290 --> 00:13:50.060
And that suggested
just that one part.

00:13:50.060 --> 00:13:53.630
You could break that into a
horizontal in the master frame,

00:13:53.630 --> 00:13:54.130
yeah.

00:13:54.130 --> 00:13:58.090
But does anybody have
something different about that,

00:13:58.090 --> 00:13:59.520
another way to do this?

00:13:59.520 --> 00:14:01.450
Do you agree with this?

00:14:01.450 --> 00:14:03.510
Is this correct?

00:14:03.510 --> 00:14:04.010
Pardon?

00:14:07.080 --> 00:14:09.160
You're treating
it like a string.

00:14:09.160 --> 00:14:09.966
Is it a string?

00:14:12.840 --> 00:14:15.935
Can that shaft
transmit shear forces?

00:14:20.111 --> 00:14:20.610
Hmm?

00:14:25.330 --> 00:14:27.730
If I grab this thing and
go left and right on it,

00:14:27.730 --> 00:14:30.020
it's putting forces in that
direction perpendicular

00:14:30.020 --> 00:14:32.650
to this.

00:14:32.650 --> 00:14:35.150
So is it conceivable
that there are

00:14:35.150 --> 00:14:37.915
forces on this
axle caused by that

00:14:37.915 --> 00:14:42.120
that are in that direction
as well as that direction?

00:14:42.120 --> 00:14:44.000
What do you think?

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:45.800
Because I can't make
an argument for sure

00:14:45.800 --> 00:14:48.169
that would eliminate
either one of those.

00:14:48.169 --> 00:14:49.960
Pretty sure there's
certainly a radial one,

00:14:49.960 --> 00:14:52.585
because that's centripetal, and
there's got to be some of that.

00:14:52.585 --> 00:14:56.100
But might there be some
in the other direction?

00:14:56.100 --> 00:15:01.270
OK, so an improvement on this, a
necessary improvement, I think,

00:15:01.270 --> 00:15:05.370
is that rather than just
one, we'd better have two.

00:15:05.370 --> 00:15:08.360
And we're going to use
my system of naming

00:15:08.360 --> 00:15:11.110
so that the answers I've
got here will work out.

00:15:11.110 --> 00:15:16.640
I'm going to call that
one F2 and this one F1.

00:15:16.640 --> 00:15:20.900
So now the rod is placing on
the cart two reaction forces

00:15:20.900 --> 00:15:22.180
which you don't know.

00:15:22.180 --> 00:15:26.160
Now, is that the complete
thing for the cart?

00:15:26.160 --> 00:15:28.390
OK, now let's do this one.

00:15:28.390 --> 00:15:33.210
Another group, tell me how to
do the second one, free body

00:15:33.210 --> 00:15:36.165
diagram.

00:15:36.165 --> 00:15:39.116
AUDIENCE: So you have
F1 and F2, but opposite.

00:15:39.116 --> 00:15:40.240
PROFESSOR: Ahh, good point.

00:15:40.240 --> 00:15:46.950
You've got an F2 this
way and an F1 like that,

00:15:46.950 --> 00:15:48.200
is what you're saying?

00:15:48.200 --> 00:15:50.330
AUDIENCE: Yeah, and
an Mg comes down.

00:15:50.330 --> 00:15:53.863
PROFESSOR: And an Mg, yeah, M2g.

00:15:53.863 --> 00:15:55.530
OK, good.

00:15:55.530 --> 00:16:00.340
Real important point--
Newton's third law.

00:16:00.340 --> 00:16:02.810
If you draw F1 and F2
here, those on that side

00:16:02.810 --> 00:16:07.300
have to be equal and opposite
in order for all this

00:16:07.300 --> 00:16:08.890
to work out without problems.

00:16:08.890 --> 00:16:11.110
OK, those look
pretty good to me.

00:16:14.010 --> 00:16:15.401
Now let's move on.

00:16:15.401 --> 00:16:16.650
This is a complicated problem.

00:16:16.650 --> 00:16:20.480
And to get a lot with it
in an hour is a challenge.

00:16:20.480 --> 00:16:22.490
And you've done a bunch
of this problem already.

00:16:22.490 --> 00:16:24.615
You did the one with
the particle on it.

00:16:24.615 --> 00:16:27.050
So there's not a great
deal of difference here.

00:16:27.050 --> 00:16:29.690
So I'm emphasizing a
few of the nuances.

00:16:29.690 --> 00:16:32.020
What I now want to
do is to talk about,

00:16:32.020 --> 00:16:36.870
how do we get equations of
motion for this problem?

00:16:36.870 --> 00:16:38.956
How many will there
be to start with?

00:16:38.956 --> 00:16:39.789
AUDIENCE: Two.

00:16:39.789 --> 00:16:41.580
PROFESSOR: Got to get
two, two rigid bodies

00:16:41.580 --> 00:16:43.831
and two degrees of freedom.

00:16:43.831 --> 00:16:46.330
And you're going to end up--
it's the two degrees of freedom

00:16:46.330 --> 00:16:48.705
that tell you you're going to
get two equations of motion

00:16:48.705 --> 00:16:49.260
at the end.

00:16:49.260 --> 00:16:53.210
OK, how many-- and I've
written three up there,

00:16:53.210 --> 00:16:55.730
but it's not necessarily true.

00:16:55.730 --> 00:16:58.490
You've been taught to this
point two different methods

00:16:58.490 --> 00:17:02.990
for getting at these
equations of motion.

00:17:02.990 --> 00:17:05.079
Somebody describe one for me.

00:17:05.079 --> 00:17:08.400
How would you personally
go about this problem?

00:17:08.400 --> 00:17:12.730
Just pick a method and
in words describe it.

00:17:12.730 --> 00:17:14.821
And think of what you
did in the last homework.

00:17:14.821 --> 00:17:19.640
AUDIENCE: Sum of external
force equals [INAUDIBLE].

00:17:19.640 --> 00:17:22.894
PROFESSOR: So sum of
external forces is--

00:17:22.894 --> 00:17:23.819
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:17:23.819 --> 00:17:28.460
PROFESSOR: OK, so on method
one here, I'll call it,

00:17:28.460 --> 00:17:33.191
you're going to say sum
of the forces on what?

00:17:33.191 --> 00:17:34.232
AUDIENCE: The rigid body.

00:17:34.232 --> 00:17:36.145
PROFESSOR: So you've
got two bodies here.

00:17:36.145 --> 00:17:38.011
So pick one.

00:17:38.011 --> 00:17:39.454
Huh?

00:17:39.454 --> 00:17:42.650
All right, so I'm going to
put this on M1 for sure.

00:17:42.650 --> 00:17:44.360
That one is translating.

00:17:44.360 --> 00:17:46.260
And you're going to
get an equation that

00:17:46.260 --> 00:17:49.040
involves its x double dot.

00:17:49.040 --> 00:17:50.870
It's got to be able to
move back and forth.

00:17:50.870 --> 00:17:53.200
You're going to need
an equation like this.

00:17:53.200 --> 00:17:55.270
So the sum of the external
forces on that mass

00:17:55.270 --> 00:18:04.900
has got to be equal
to M1 times-- right?

00:18:04.900 --> 00:18:11.390
And we can write an equation for
that in terms of this free body

00:18:11.390 --> 00:18:12.790
diagram.

00:18:12.790 --> 00:18:15.310
In the i direction,
you've got this.

00:18:15.310 --> 00:18:16.750
You've got this.

00:18:16.750 --> 00:18:21.330
You have the normal forces
gravity don't contribute.

00:18:21.330 --> 00:18:28.700
And components of this and
this have to be added in.

00:18:28.700 --> 00:18:32.650
You have to do an F2, probably
cosine theta, and an F1 sine

00:18:32.650 --> 00:18:33.960
theta, and add them in.

00:18:33.960 --> 00:18:35.460
Because they're the
external forces.

00:18:35.460 --> 00:18:37.710
So you've got all these
summation of forces

00:18:37.710 --> 00:18:39.390
on that side.

00:18:39.390 --> 00:18:41.560
That gives you one equation.

00:18:41.560 --> 00:18:46.530
This will give you an
equation for the motion

00:18:46.530 --> 00:18:47.900
of the first mass.

00:18:47.900 --> 00:18:49.950
And it'll have some
unknowns in it.

00:18:49.950 --> 00:18:50.700
And what are they?

00:18:53.510 --> 00:18:56.205
Describe them.

00:18:56.205 --> 00:18:57.580
So you're going
to get a function

00:18:57.580 --> 00:19:00.640
over here of a couple unknowns.

00:19:00.640 --> 00:19:03.491
This is going to be a function
of what that you don't know?

00:19:03.491 --> 00:19:04.892
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:19:04.892 --> 00:19:08.840
PROFESSOR: F1 and
F2, and then also x

00:19:08.840 --> 00:19:12.366
double dot and thetas and
theta dots and so forth,

00:19:12.366 --> 00:19:13.740
all the variables
in the problem.

00:19:13.740 --> 00:19:15.114
But these are two
unknowns you've

00:19:15.114 --> 00:19:16.800
got to ultimately get rid of.

00:19:16.800 --> 00:19:18.870
OK, what else are you
going to do in method one?

00:19:22.132 --> 00:19:24.090
You've got to deal with
the second mass, right?

00:19:24.090 --> 00:19:25.300
What would you do then?

00:19:25.300 --> 00:19:26.175
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:19:31.420 --> 00:19:34.360
PROFESSOR: So some of the
force is now on M2, for sure.

00:19:34.360 --> 00:19:37.120
And that's going to give
you a couple equations.

00:19:37.120 --> 00:19:40.020
What else do you
do in your method?

00:19:40.020 --> 00:19:42.241
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:19:42.241 --> 00:19:43.990
PROFESSOR: [INAUDIBLE]
torques about what?

00:19:47.490 --> 00:19:50.232
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:19:50.232 --> 00:19:51.440
PROFESSOR: Have I named them?

00:19:51.440 --> 00:19:53.820
Look at that diagram there.

00:19:53.820 --> 00:19:56.460
So you're going to
do your torques, sum

00:19:56.460 --> 00:20:00.020
of the torques, about A, OK?

00:20:00.020 --> 00:20:06.690
And if you sum torques
about A, what are they?

00:20:06.690 --> 00:20:10.470
I'll let you guys pursue that
a little bit, figure out,

00:20:10.470 --> 00:20:17.890
what are the torques about
this point in this problem?

00:20:17.890 --> 00:20:20.040
OK, what do you get?

00:20:20.040 --> 00:20:21.670
Sum of the torques about A?

00:20:26.090 --> 00:20:29.430
z is in which--
which positive z?

00:20:29.430 --> 00:20:31.960
x, y, positive z coming
out of the board.

00:20:31.960 --> 00:20:36.060
What produces torque about
this point in this problem?

00:20:36.060 --> 00:20:36.940
Just what?

00:20:36.940 --> 00:20:37.690
AUDIENCE: Gravity.

00:20:37.690 --> 00:20:38.690
PROFESSOR: Just gravity.

00:20:38.690 --> 00:20:40.822
And is it positive or negative?

00:20:40.822 --> 00:20:44.390
And it's a component of
gravity perpendicular to this.

00:20:44.390 --> 00:20:49.340
So it's probably sine theta
M2g sine theta in the minus.

00:20:49.340 --> 00:20:57.220
So it's minus M2g L over 2--
you need the moment arm-- sine

00:20:57.220 --> 00:21:01.030
theta in the k hat direction.

00:21:01.030 --> 00:21:17.840
And that's going to be equal
to the angular dH, dT about A.

00:21:17.840 --> 00:21:20.310
Sum of the torques, time
rate of change of the angular

00:21:20.310 --> 00:21:21.960
momentum about A--
because that's what

00:21:21.960 --> 00:21:23.580
you've chosen to work about.

00:21:23.580 --> 00:21:27.010
And you always have this
term you have to check on.

00:21:30.460 --> 00:21:32.770
OK, so that's the method.

00:21:32.770 --> 00:21:34.530
This is method one.

00:21:34.530 --> 00:21:37.730
I'll call this the tau
with respect to A method.

00:21:40.940 --> 00:21:42.560
You have to write this equation.

00:21:42.560 --> 00:21:47.700
You have two unknowns
that pop up in it.

00:21:47.700 --> 00:21:49.120
You go to the second mass.

00:21:49.120 --> 00:21:51.180
You write the F
equals ma for that,

00:21:51.180 --> 00:21:54.150
and you're going to
get two equations.

00:21:54.150 --> 00:21:56.520
If you do it in the
local coordinate system,

00:21:56.520 --> 00:21:59.590
in the rotating one, you
get mass times acceleration

00:21:59.590 --> 00:22:01.210
in the i direction.

00:22:01.210 --> 00:22:04.970
You get F1 and a
component of gravity.

00:22:04.970 --> 00:22:08.610
And in the j direction,
m2 acceleration in j,

00:22:08.610 --> 00:22:11.730
you get F2 and a piece that's
acceleration of gravity.

00:22:16.610 --> 00:22:18.600
You don't know this yet.

00:22:18.600 --> 00:22:20.310
But you can find it.

00:22:20.310 --> 00:22:24.520
You know how to find
those velocities now.

00:22:24.520 --> 00:22:25.650
You've done it before.

00:22:25.650 --> 00:22:30.440
So the velocity of
G with respect to O,

00:22:30.440 --> 00:22:32.230
probably going to
have an X double

00:22:32.230 --> 00:22:38.930
dot I hat plus something that
will be like L/2 theta dot,

00:22:38.930 --> 00:22:40.995
and in what direction?

00:22:40.995 --> 00:22:41.495
Hmm?

00:22:44.080 --> 00:22:49.130
It's rotating like
this-- j hat, little j.

00:22:49.130 --> 00:22:50.350
So there's your velocity.

00:22:50.350 --> 00:22:54.030
You can take the time derivative
of that to get an acceleration,

00:22:54.030 --> 00:22:56.370
X double dot-- that's not true.

00:22:56.370 --> 00:22:58.170
Down here, you get
an X double dot.

00:22:58.170 --> 00:22:59.580
In this one, you get two terms.

00:22:59.580 --> 00:23:01.580
Because that's a rotating piece.

00:23:01.580 --> 00:23:06.200
You get a centripetal
term and an Euler term

00:23:06.200 --> 00:23:07.410
that come out of that.

00:23:07.410 --> 00:23:10.660
So then now you know
velocities and accelerations.

00:23:10.660 --> 00:23:13.320
You can put the
accelerations on this side.

00:23:13.320 --> 00:23:15.060
You can solve this
first equation

00:23:15.060 --> 00:23:18.645
for F1, second equation for F2.

00:23:18.645 --> 00:23:21.340
You take those and
put them in here.

00:23:21.340 --> 00:23:25.110
And you finally have one of
your equations of motion.

00:23:25.110 --> 00:23:32.590
Down here, the external
torque only involves gravity.

00:23:32.590 --> 00:23:36.150
So do your F1 and F2 appear--
do you have to mess with those

00:23:36.150 --> 00:23:43.450
in this final equation or not?

00:23:43.450 --> 00:23:47.800
This is the reason you use
point A. This equation does not

00:23:47.800 --> 00:23:49.220
involve F1 or F2.

00:23:49.220 --> 00:23:51.860
There's no moments
created by F1 and F2.

00:23:51.860 --> 00:23:55.120
The stuff on the right hand
side is only kinematics and mass

00:23:55.120 --> 00:23:57.890
moments of inertia.

00:23:57.890 --> 00:24:00.260
This thing will give
you an i with respect--

00:24:00.260 --> 00:24:03.260
you can think of this as
it's going to give you

00:24:03.260 --> 00:24:07.450
an i with respect to
G theta double dot

00:24:07.450 --> 00:24:10.210
plus some other terms.

00:24:10.210 --> 00:24:12.145
And I want to talk about this.

00:24:12.145 --> 00:24:13.410
Does this term go to 0?

00:24:17.200 --> 00:24:20.210
Is the velocity of
A 0 in this problem?

00:24:20.210 --> 00:24:20.960
No way.

00:24:20.960 --> 00:24:23.800
And in what direction is it?

00:24:23.800 --> 00:24:27.450
Horizontal, right,
capital I hat.

00:24:27.450 --> 00:24:29.570
P, the momentum of
the second thing,

00:24:29.570 --> 00:24:33.170
has these velocity components.

00:24:33.170 --> 00:24:36.330
The P is equal to m times that.

00:24:36.330 --> 00:24:38.520
And you have velocity
components in the I,

00:24:38.520 --> 00:24:39.960
which is the same as vA.

00:24:39.960 --> 00:24:43.440
But you have another velocity
component that's not the same.

00:24:43.440 --> 00:24:45.890
So is that cross
product going to be 0?

00:24:45.890 --> 00:24:46.930
No way.

00:24:46.930 --> 00:24:49.140
You have to deal with that term.

00:24:49.140 --> 00:24:53.780
It happens that you can
express H with respect

00:24:53.780 --> 00:25:02.440
to A as H with respect
to G plus rG A cross P.

00:25:02.440 --> 00:25:07.440
And you know P, because
you just found v. It's mv.

00:25:07.440 --> 00:25:14.140
And r, rG A, is just
L over 2 j, little j,

00:25:14.140 --> 00:25:16.700
which is from here to here.

00:25:16.700 --> 00:25:21.896
It's L over 2 little--
no i, excuse me.

00:25:21.896 --> 00:25:23.920
So that's r, L over 2 i.

00:25:23.920 --> 00:25:27.239
So you can crank out
this cross product.

00:25:27.239 --> 00:25:29.530
Then you have to take the
time derivative of this right

00:25:29.530 --> 00:25:31.560
here, this whole thing.

00:25:31.560 --> 00:25:38.340
Every time when you take the
time derivative of this part,

00:25:38.340 --> 00:25:41.000
you will get a P. So
you get multiple pieces.

00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:43.150
But one of them
will be minus that.

00:25:45.920 --> 00:25:48.940
This thing creates a piece
that's exactly minus that,

00:25:48.940 --> 00:25:50.300
and they'll cancel.

00:25:50.300 --> 00:25:54.290
But you've got to go
through the cranking it out

00:25:54.290 --> 00:25:55.930
till you get to that point.

00:25:55.930 --> 00:25:58.050
OK, that's one
method of doing it.

00:25:58.050 --> 00:26:01.370
Let's talk briefly
about a second method.

00:26:01.370 --> 00:26:03.620
What is the other way to go
about doing this problem?

00:26:07.564 --> 00:26:09.540
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:26:09.540 --> 00:26:12.330
PROFESSOR: That's method three.

00:26:12.330 --> 00:26:15.452
We're going to hurry
so I can get to it.

00:26:15.452 --> 00:26:17.785
What's a second way to do
this problem, a close relative

00:26:17.785 --> 00:26:18.750
of the first way?

00:26:21.956 --> 00:26:24.630
But I want you to have
all these different ways

00:26:24.630 --> 00:26:26.320
of doing it in your tool kit.

00:26:26.320 --> 00:26:29.490
Because some problems are
easy, more easily done.

00:26:29.490 --> 00:26:33.050
There's another way than this.

00:26:33.050 --> 00:26:37.090
This is perfectly appropriate
for this type of problem.

00:26:37.090 --> 00:26:44.890
If the problem we were
doing involved this,

00:26:44.890 --> 00:26:46.520
would you do this method?

00:26:46.520 --> 00:26:48.460
What would you do?

00:26:48.460 --> 00:26:49.400
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:26:49.400 --> 00:26:50.900
PROFESSOR: No, can't
use energy yet.

00:26:50.900 --> 00:26:51.920
That's next week.

00:26:51.920 --> 00:26:52.860
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:26:52.860 --> 00:26:54.405
PROFESSOR: Ahh, right.

00:26:54.405 --> 00:26:57.270
So the second
method is basically

00:26:57.270 --> 00:26:59.900
this is the same, this piece.

00:26:59.900 --> 00:27:04.200
But the second part--
and this is the same,

00:27:04.200 --> 00:27:05.740
sum of the forces about M2.

00:27:05.740 --> 00:27:07.600
You do both of those forces.

00:27:07.600 --> 00:27:11.460
You do sum forces
for sure, M1 and M2.

00:27:11.460 --> 00:27:17.838
But the third step is you
do sum of torques about g.

00:27:17.838 --> 00:27:26.600
If you sum torques
about g, which is here,

00:27:26.600 --> 00:27:29.720
what appears in the sum torques?

00:27:29.720 --> 00:27:31.343
Does Mg contribute?

00:27:31.343 --> 00:27:35.021
No, what are the
external torques about g?

00:27:35.021 --> 00:27:36.452
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:27:36.452 --> 00:27:43.550
PROFESSOR: F2, L/2,
positive F2 L/2 k.

00:27:43.550 --> 00:27:47.390
So that equation,
summing torques about g,

00:27:47.390 --> 00:27:51.030
will give you an F2 L/2 k.

00:27:51.030 --> 00:27:53.310
And now you've got
that unknown popping up

00:27:53.310 --> 00:27:54.830
in your torque equation.

00:27:54.830 --> 00:27:58.020
And you know that it also pops
up in these two equations.

00:27:58.020 --> 00:28:01.140
Because we solved them.

00:28:01.140 --> 00:28:07.030
So now why does this method
have a slight advantage

00:28:07.030 --> 00:28:09.162
over this method?

00:28:09.162 --> 00:28:10.940
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:28:10.940 --> 00:28:13.641
PROFESSOR: Well, you don't
get F2 or F1 popping up

00:28:13.641 --> 00:28:14.640
in your torque equation.

00:28:14.640 --> 00:28:16.680
You immediately get to
the answer for that one.

00:28:16.680 --> 00:28:18.013
So it's a little more efficient.

00:28:24.490 --> 00:28:32.800
So is there a way
to get directly

00:28:32.800 --> 00:28:36.870
at the two equations
we're after?

00:28:36.870 --> 00:28:41.950
The second equation we get
from this torque thing.

00:28:41.950 --> 00:28:45.880
The first equation we
get from resolving this.

00:28:45.880 --> 00:28:50.510
This is a mass times--
M1 X double dot.

00:28:50.510 --> 00:28:52.680
And you get this
function of F1 and F2.

00:28:52.680 --> 00:28:54.920
And you have to substitute
in for these F1's

00:28:54.920 --> 00:28:58.060
and F2's until you
finally get that equation.

00:28:58.060 --> 00:29:00.570
So that's kind of tedious.

00:29:00.570 --> 00:29:05.230
So is there a way to get
directly at this without having

00:29:05.230 --> 00:29:07.700
to mess with F1 and F2 at all?

00:29:07.700 --> 00:29:10.670
And that's what is the key
to what you're talking about.

00:29:10.670 --> 00:29:11.980
Let's look at something here.

00:29:11.980 --> 00:29:20.360
Let's do the vector sum
of the forces on M1.

00:29:24.270 --> 00:29:29.170
We get an F. Let's look
at our free body diagram,

00:29:29.170 --> 00:29:47.920
F2j plus F1i minus kx minus
bx dot and a minus M1g.

00:29:47.920 --> 00:29:49.920
Well, those are-- well,
we'll put them in there,

00:29:49.920 --> 00:29:52.600
at least throw them in there.

00:29:52.600 --> 00:30:04.370
This is in my capital J plus
N1 plus N2 capital J hat here.

00:30:04.370 --> 00:30:07.320
Is that all the forces, all the
vector forces in that problem?

00:30:12.630 --> 00:30:13.860
Did I miss anything?

00:30:13.860 --> 00:30:16.400
I've got spring, the
dashpot, the forces

00:30:16.400 --> 00:30:19.614
caused by the rod, gravity,
and the normal forces.

00:30:19.614 --> 00:30:32.490
OK, and we could figure
out the component of this,

00:30:32.490 --> 00:30:37.150
the sum of the forces on M1
in the capital X direction.

00:30:37.150 --> 00:30:39.200
We could figure
that out from-- this

00:30:39.200 --> 00:30:41.450
has component in that direction.

00:30:41.450 --> 00:30:43.160
It just involves thetas.

00:30:43.160 --> 00:30:44.195
These go away, then.

00:30:44.195 --> 00:30:46.570
You don't have to deal with
this stuff in the x equation.

00:30:49.950 --> 00:30:52.217
But there's our sum of the
forces on the first body.

00:30:52.217 --> 00:30:54.300
Let's do the sum of the
forces on the second body.

00:30:57.870 --> 00:30:58.930
What are they?

00:31:04.056 --> 00:31:05.460
AUDIENCE: Gravity.

00:31:05.460 --> 00:31:10.800
PROFESSOR: OK, so you've
got a minus M2g on it.

00:31:10.800 --> 00:31:12.120
And what else?

00:31:15.992 --> 00:31:17.882
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:31:17.882 --> 00:31:19.590
PROFESSOR: But with
opposite sign, right?

00:31:19.590 --> 00:31:25.710
F2 little j minus F1 little
i, and anything else?

00:31:28.330 --> 00:31:29.570
Nothing, right?

00:31:29.570 --> 00:31:30.700
Let's add the two together.

00:31:33.570 --> 00:31:39.020
Oh, and this one has got to
be equal to the mass, M1,

00:31:39.020 --> 00:31:47.720
times the acceleration,
the x component I plus M1

00:31:47.720 --> 00:31:53.380
acceleration in the-- I
can't write over here-- ay

00:31:53.380 --> 00:31:58.250
in the capital J hat direction.

00:31:58.250 --> 00:31:59.940
That gives us mass
times acceleration,

00:31:59.940 --> 00:32:02.790
is what all the sums of
the forces is equal to.

00:32:02.790 --> 00:32:09.180
The same thing here-- this is
equal to the little mass, M2,

00:32:09.180 --> 00:32:11.250
times its acceleration.

00:32:11.250 --> 00:32:19.500
And it'll have components
in the-- this is mass 2.

00:32:19.500 --> 00:32:23.680
And it'll have components we
can put in the I hat direction,

00:32:23.680 --> 00:32:33.720
and plus M2 acceleration 2--
maybe I'll do it like this.

00:32:37.380 --> 00:32:40.430
a2y, and this is
in the j direction.

00:32:40.430 --> 00:32:45.090
And those two things
we can add together.

00:32:45.090 --> 00:32:53.148
And so if I add them together,
and I put M1 plus M2 times--

00:32:53.148 --> 00:32:57.151
I'll just call it the
total acceleration.

00:32:57.151 --> 00:32:58.850
Well, I don't want to do that.

00:32:58.850 --> 00:33:00.780
I don't want to say this.

00:33:07.362 --> 00:33:09.320
I'm hurrying because
we're running out of time.

00:33:09.320 --> 00:33:17.850
M1 times its acceleration
times M2 plus its acceleration

00:33:17.850 --> 00:33:20.740
is equal to-- and now we sum
up everything on the right hand

00:33:20.740 --> 00:33:22.610
side.

00:33:22.610 --> 00:33:25.440
And the key thing
that happens here

00:33:25.440 --> 00:33:26.780
is what happens at F1 and F2?

00:33:26.780 --> 00:33:27.610
AUDIENCE: Drop out.

00:33:27.610 --> 00:33:29.766
PROFESSOR: They
completely drop out.

00:33:33.080 --> 00:33:40.630
So on the right hand side, it's
not a function of F1 and F2.

00:33:47.050 --> 00:33:51.880
The equating of motion that
we were trying to get here

00:33:51.880 --> 00:33:54.270
was just in the I direction.

00:33:54.270 --> 00:33:56.810
That's all we need
for that big cart.

00:33:56.810 --> 00:33:59.460
So if we go down
here and extract

00:33:59.460 --> 00:34:06.830
the I component of this total
sum, it'll be an equation.

00:34:06.830 --> 00:34:08.710
It'll involve M1 and M2.

00:34:08.710 --> 00:34:15.760
And it'll have cosines and
sines and thetas and things like

00:34:15.760 --> 00:34:17.860
that, but no F1's, no F2's.

00:34:17.860 --> 00:34:24.090
You will get directly to this,
the final result that you got

00:34:24.090 --> 00:34:26.250
here where you had to
go in and substitute

00:34:26.250 --> 00:34:29.376
in for F1's and F2's.

00:34:29.376 --> 00:34:30.709
So it'll get it to you directly.

00:34:33.790 --> 00:34:36.420
What do you need to
solve it, though?

00:34:36.420 --> 00:34:38.540
You need to know the
acceleration of mass 1.

00:34:41.070 --> 00:34:41.900
You know that.

00:34:41.900 --> 00:34:43.340
That's trivial.

00:34:43.340 --> 00:34:47.530
You need to know the
acceleration of mass 2.

00:34:47.530 --> 00:34:52.400
And that you did
by taking the time

00:34:52.400 --> 00:34:53.580
derivatives of these terms.

00:34:53.580 --> 00:34:56.210
You know the acceleration
of that mass.

00:34:56.210 --> 00:34:58.870
So you need that expression.

00:34:58.870 --> 00:35:02.190
And you plug that in here.

00:35:02.190 --> 00:35:04.770
And everything else in the
right hand side you know.

00:35:04.770 --> 00:35:11.022
It's kx dot, bx dot, minus Mg,
M1g minus M2g, and so forth.

00:35:11.022 --> 00:35:12.480
All the rest of
the stuff is known.

00:35:12.480 --> 00:35:12.770
Yeah.

00:35:12.770 --> 00:35:15.170
AUDIENCE: Does this give you
three equations of motion?

00:35:15.170 --> 00:35:17.003
PROFESSOR: Well, it
gives you two equations.

00:35:18.980 --> 00:35:22.120
At this point, you'd break
this into capital I and capital

00:35:22.120 --> 00:35:26.280
J. The one in the capital
J direction is equal to 0.

00:35:26.280 --> 00:35:27.770
There's no motion
in that direction

00:35:27.770 --> 00:35:30.490
for the main mass, the cart.

00:35:30.490 --> 00:35:36.990
There's only motion in the
inertial frame x direction.

00:35:36.990 --> 00:35:39.417
So that's all.

00:35:39.417 --> 00:35:40.500
This is a vector equation.

00:35:40.500 --> 00:35:46.535
It has two pieces to it, I and
J. The J is a static equation.

00:35:46.535 --> 00:35:48.310
The I is your dynamic one.

00:35:48.310 --> 00:35:52.250
And it's this one that you would
have found in this problem,

00:35:52.250 --> 00:35:55.630
but without ever having
to solve for F1 and F2.

00:35:55.630 --> 00:36:00.700
But you do have to go out
and find the acceleration

00:36:00.700 --> 00:36:02.910
of both masses.

00:36:02.910 --> 00:36:06.050
Mass times acceleration, what
this is really saying-- this

00:36:06.050 --> 00:36:08.380
is what you asked
about the system.

00:36:08.380 --> 00:36:09.940
This is sort of the
system approach.

00:36:09.940 --> 00:36:15.230
If you think of this
whole thing as a system,

00:36:15.230 --> 00:36:20.080
draw a box around it, the
sum of the external forces

00:36:20.080 --> 00:36:24.910
on the system is
equal to the mass,

00:36:24.910 --> 00:36:30.650
the total mass, times actually
the acceleration of the center

00:36:30.650 --> 00:36:32.620
of mass of the system.

00:36:32.620 --> 00:36:35.250
But this acceleration
times the center

00:36:35.250 --> 00:36:38.480
of mass of the system, you can
break this into two pieces.

00:36:38.480 --> 00:36:45.040
It is this term plus this term.

00:36:45.040 --> 00:36:49.080
And then that's
the total system.

00:36:49.080 --> 00:36:52.170
And all you have
to put on this side

00:36:52.170 --> 00:36:56.170
is the summation of
the external forces.

00:36:56.170 --> 00:37:00.060
But the external forces are
not-- the internal forces

00:37:00.060 --> 00:37:00.919
don't count.

00:37:00.919 --> 00:37:02.210
They're not part of the system.

00:37:02.210 --> 00:37:04.100
So you only have to
put the external forces

00:37:04.100 --> 00:37:10.040
on it-- Mg's springs, dashpots,
normal forces, outside forces,

00:37:10.040 --> 00:37:13.820
the only ones that go over here.

00:37:13.820 --> 00:37:16.450
The reason we don't
usually think of doing this

00:37:16.450 --> 00:37:18.470
is because when you
think about the system,

00:37:18.470 --> 00:37:23.240
you write it as the acceleration
of the center of mass.

00:37:23.240 --> 00:37:25.270
But you have to
realize that you can

00:37:25.270 --> 00:37:29.680
get that expression as the
sum of the parts, the sum

00:37:29.680 --> 00:37:32.970
of each bit times
its acceleration,

00:37:32.970 --> 00:37:35.110
and sum them all up,
is the same answer

00:37:35.110 --> 00:37:37.900
as the sum of the masses
times the acceleration

00:37:37.900 --> 00:37:41.240
of the center of mass
of the whole system.

00:37:41.240 --> 00:37:44.275
So we've still got
a couple of minutes.

00:37:44.275 --> 00:37:46.400
Last hour, I ran over, and
we couldn't get to this.

00:37:46.400 --> 00:37:50.010
So there is, in a way, yet
another thing you can do.

00:37:50.010 --> 00:37:52.770
And that's think of the
thing as a whole system.

00:37:52.770 --> 00:37:54.520
And sometimes that'll
give you an equation

00:37:54.520 --> 00:37:56.540
without having to use
F1, without having

00:37:56.540 --> 00:37:59.110
to solve for internal
forces-- pretty cool.

00:38:04.170 --> 00:38:09.980
All right, so
questions, thoughts?

00:38:09.980 --> 00:38:10.650
Yeah.

00:38:10.650 --> 00:38:13.548
AUDIENCE: Is it safe
to say that if we

00:38:13.548 --> 00:38:17.090
have two more rigid bodies,
we should probably consider it

00:38:17.090 --> 00:38:19.830
as a whole system [INAUDIBLE]?

00:38:19.830 --> 00:38:22.930
PROFESSOR: Well, I can't
generalize on that.

00:38:22.930 --> 00:38:25.980
I haven't done enough problems
like that myself to even

00:38:25.980 --> 00:38:30.330
have enough experience
to know just how often is

00:38:30.330 --> 00:38:31.455
that going to help you out.

00:38:34.780 --> 00:38:37.500
This one, there's a
pretty obvious equation

00:38:37.500 --> 00:38:40.950
that you're going to write in
this direction on that mass.

00:38:40.950 --> 00:38:45.360
It's constrained to a single
motion and a single coordinate

00:38:45.360 --> 00:38:46.930
you're assigning to it.

00:38:46.930 --> 00:38:48.870
And probably in
cases like that where

00:38:48.870 --> 00:38:51.730
you can isolate one
of the rigid bodies,

00:38:51.730 --> 00:38:54.436
there might be some advantage
in doing something like this.

00:38:54.436 --> 00:38:56.102
AUDIENCE: --more
difficult to figure out

00:38:56.102 --> 00:38:58.440
what the accelerations
for both rigid bodies was,

00:38:58.440 --> 00:39:01.210
then it would be
better [INAUDIBLE].

00:39:01.210 --> 00:39:04.890
PROFESSOR: Yeah, this
one, all of these methods

00:39:04.890 --> 00:39:08.880
you're going to end up having
to compute the velocities

00:39:08.880 --> 00:39:11.720
and accelerations of each piece.

00:39:11.720 --> 00:39:13.400
And if you've got
that information,

00:39:13.400 --> 00:39:17.770
you may as well
use it if there's

00:39:17.770 --> 00:39:24.020
something to be gained by
doing a clever step like this.

00:39:24.020 --> 00:39:24.827
Yeah.

00:39:24.827 --> 00:39:27.326
AUDIENCE: What confuses me is
that method one, method three,

00:39:27.326 --> 00:39:29.410
there's no-- so you
said there's going

00:39:29.410 --> 00:39:30.535
to be two things in motion.

00:39:30.535 --> 00:39:31.680
But why is it--

00:39:31.680 --> 00:39:33.410
PROFESSOR: So this,
this method three,

00:39:33.410 --> 00:39:37.940
this shows you a different
way to get that equation.

00:39:37.940 --> 00:39:39.900
You still need this.

00:39:39.900 --> 00:39:42.260
AUDIENCE: Oh, this is
just for the first--

00:39:42.260 --> 00:39:45.160
PROFESSOR: This is a clever way
to get just this first equation

00:39:45.160 --> 00:39:46.810
down.

00:39:46.810 --> 00:39:49.240
You still need a
second equation.

00:39:49.240 --> 00:39:50.890
And you still are
going to have to--

00:39:50.890 --> 00:39:53.780
and then you don't want to
have to mess with F1 and F2.

00:39:53.780 --> 00:39:55.950
So we've just found
a way to never have

00:39:55.950 --> 00:39:59.010
to mess with F1 and F2
in at least this problem.

00:39:59.010 --> 00:40:00.790
And that is get
the first equation

00:40:00.790 --> 00:40:04.370
by using this trick,
the system equation.

00:40:04.370 --> 00:40:07.500
And it's a sum
forces expression.

00:40:07.500 --> 00:40:11.790
And then the second equation you
need is this moment equation.

00:40:11.790 --> 00:40:15.070
And you have two choices,
about G or about A.

00:40:15.070 --> 00:40:17.400
And which one can you
do it without having

00:40:17.400 --> 00:40:19.760
to find F1 and F2?

00:40:19.760 --> 00:40:22.784
I'm doing it about
A. So there's a way

00:40:22.784 --> 00:40:24.200
that you can do
this whole problem

00:40:24.200 --> 00:40:28.130
and never have to address
what F1 and F2 are.

00:40:28.130 --> 00:40:32.490
And that's kind of a combination
of these two pieces here.

00:40:32.490 --> 00:40:34.740
The traditional way, the
textbook way, you open it up,

00:40:34.740 --> 00:40:36.510
the textbook will
teach you this one.

00:40:36.510 --> 00:40:39.776
And it'll teach you about
A and teach you about G.

00:40:39.776 --> 00:40:44.560
But you don't often run
into-- there's sometimes

00:40:44.560 --> 00:40:49.890
a direct way of doing it
without finding the F1 and F2.

00:40:52.704 --> 00:40:54.120
Unfortunately,
there are thousands

00:40:54.120 --> 00:40:55.161
of problems in the world.

00:40:55.161 --> 00:41:01.400
And it's a little hard to say
in advance what method to use

00:41:01.400 --> 00:41:03.310
and what's going to
work the easiest.

00:41:03.310 --> 00:41:05.990
But there's some insight.

00:41:05.990 --> 00:41:07.820
There's some
generalizations that you

00:41:07.820 --> 00:41:13.020
can get from looking at things
in these different ways.

00:41:13.020 --> 00:41:18.140
If you have forces
at a pivot point,

00:41:18.140 --> 00:41:20.360
taking the moments
of the pivot point,

00:41:20.360 --> 00:41:23.070
unknowns of the pivot
point, taking the moments

00:41:23.070 --> 00:41:25.290
about that point will
get rid of them for you.

00:41:25.290 --> 00:41:27.400
That's the one generalization
that you can usually

00:41:27.400 --> 00:41:28.170
take to the bank.

00:41:31.720 --> 00:41:35.310
But beyond that-- and if
the thing's unconstrained.

00:41:35.310 --> 00:41:38.960
So if it's fixed axis
rotation, then you

00:41:38.960 --> 00:41:42.100
want to use about the
axis of fixed axis.

00:41:42.100 --> 00:41:44.190
This is a moving axis.

00:41:44.190 --> 00:41:48.999
But it is still rotating about
a fixed point that's moving.

00:41:48.999 --> 00:41:50.790
There's still some
advantage of doing this.

00:41:54.270 --> 00:41:59.400
If it's the eraser
problem, this thing,

00:41:59.400 --> 00:42:02.330
where you have no fixed
points of rotation--

00:42:02.330 --> 00:42:06.070
if you take a body, and
you do this with it,

00:42:06.070 --> 00:42:08.270
where is it spinning about?

00:42:08.270 --> 00:42:10.295
Where is its axis of rotation?

00:42:10.295 --> 00:42:11.170
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:42:11.170 --> 00:42:12.890
PROFESSOR: Always, right?

00:42:12.890 --> 00:42:15.130
That you can take to the bank.

00:42:15.130 --> 00:42:19.780
If there's no forced
pivot, bodies on their own

00:42:19.780 --> 00:42:24.000
only rotate about their centers
of gravity, centers of mass.

00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:26.530
And then when you
have free bodies that

00:42:26.530 --> 00:42:30.250
don't have constraints that
are forcing them to move

00:42:30.250 --> 00:42:32.800
with respect to something,
if there's no constraints,

00:42:32.800 --> 00:42:36.350
then you want to take the
torques about G for sure.

00:42:40.190 --> 00:42:47.140
Good, all right, see
you guys next Tuesday.
