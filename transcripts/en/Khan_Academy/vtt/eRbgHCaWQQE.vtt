00:00:00.503 --> 00:00:01.827
- [Instructor] The function m is given

00:00:01.827 --> 00:00:04.549
in three equivalent forms.

00:00:04.549 --> 00:00:08.775
Which form most quickly
reveals the y-intercept?

00:00:08.775 --> 00:00:11.010
So let's just remind ourselves.

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:13.531
If I have a function,

00:00:13.531 --> 00:00:16.114
the graph y is equal to m of x.

00:00:17.499 --> 00:00:20.664
And these are all equivalent
forms, they tell us that.

00:00:20.664 --> 00:00:22.551
The function m is given
in three equivalent forms.

00:00:22.551 --> 00:00:23.889
I should be able to
algebraically manipulate

00:00:23.889 --> 00:00:26.815
anyone of these to get
any of the other ones.

00:00:26.815 --> 00:00:29.543
And so, if I wanted to
graph y is equal to m of x,

00:00:29.543 --> 00:00:32.591
and let's say it looks
something like this.

00:00:32.591 --> 00:00:34.724
I actually know it's a
downward opening parabola,

00:00:34.724 --> 00:00:36.273
because I can look at
this form right over here

00:00:36.273 --> 00:00:37.414
and say, "Hey look, the coefficient

00:00:37.414 --> 00:00:40.507
"on the second degree
term here is a negative."

00:00:40.507 --> 00:00:42.177
So it's going to be a
downward opening parabola.

00:00:42.177 --> 00:00:44.314
That's a messy drawing of it.

00:00:44.314 --> 00:00:46.529
And so if we're talking
about the y intercept,

00:00:46.529 --> 00:00:50.269
we're saying, "Hey where does
it intersect the y-axis?"

00:00:50.269 --> 00:00:55.225
So what is the y value
when x is equal to zero?

00:00:55.225 --> 00:00:56.812
So it boils down to how quickly

00:00:56.812 --> 00:00:58.998
can we evaluate m of zero?

00:00:58.998 --> 00:01:02.543
What is m of x, when x is equal to zero?

00:01:02.543 --> 00:01:06.030
So how quickly can you evaluate m of zero?

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:09.287
Well in this top one, I
can substitute zero for x

00:01:09.287 --> 00:01:10.995
and so it'll be negative two

00:01:10.995 --> 00:01:13.696
times negative three times negative nine.

00:01:13.696 --> 00:01:15.481
So it's not too hard to figure out,

00:01:15.481 --> 00:01:18.244
but there's going to be
some calculation in my head.

00:01:18.244 --> 00:01:20.846
Similarly in the second choice,

00:01:20.846 --> 00:01:24.515
for x equals zero, I then
get negative six-squared,

00:01:24.515 --> 00:01:26.505
which is positive 36 times negative two,

00:01:26.505 --> 00:01:27.542
which is negative 72,

00:01:27.542 --> 00:01:30.032
and then I have to add
that to positive 18.

00:01:30.032 --> 00:01:31.129
I can do that,

00:01:31.129 --> 00:01:34.124
but it's a little bit of computation.

00:01:34.124 --> 00:01:36.051
But here for this last one,

00:01:36.051 --> 00:01:38.203
and this is known as standard form,

00:01:38.203 --> 00:01:40.399
if I say x equals zero
that term disappears,

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:43.244
that term disappears and
I'm just left with m of zero

00:01:43.244 --> 00:01:45.244
is equal to negative 54.

00:01:46.127 --> 00:01:49.748
So standard form, this is
standard form right over here,

00:01:49.748 --> 00:01:52.351
was by far the easiest.

00:01:52.351 --> 00:01:56.949
So we know the y-intercept
is zero comma negative 54.

00:01:56.949 --> 00:01:58.573
Now one rule of caution.

00:01:58.573 --> 00:02:03.038
Sometimes you might look at
what is called, vertex form.

00:02:03.038 --> 00:02:04.500
And as we'll see this is the easiest one

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:06.615
where it is to identify the vertex.

00:02:06.615 --> 00:02:08.525
But when you see this
little plus 18 hanging out,

00:02:08.525 --> 00:02:10.521
it looks a lot like this negative 54

00:02:10.521 --> 00:02:11.414
that was hanging out.

00:02:11.414 --> 00:02:12.674
And you say, "Hey, when x equals zero,

00:02:12.674 --> 00:02:14.381
"maybe I can just cross that out

00:02:14.381 --> 00:02:16.818
"the same way that I
cross these terms out."

00:02:16.818 --> 00:02:18.528
And be very, very careful there,

00:02:18.528 --> 00:02:19.629
because if x equals zero,

00:02:19.629 --> 00:02:21.581
this whole thing does not equal zero.

00:02:21.581 --> 00:02:23.818
When x is equal to zero, as I just said,

00:02:23.818 --> 00:02:24.956
you have negative six-squared,

00:02:24.956 --> 00:02:26.171
which is 36 times negative two.

00:02:26.171 --> 00:02:28.164
This is equal to negative 72.

00:02:28.164 --> 00:02:31.291
So m of zero is definitely not 18.

00:02:31.291 --> 00:02:33.087
So be very, very careful.

00:02:33.087 --> 00:02:35.488
But we can see that the best choice

00:02:35.488 --> 00:02:37.597
is this one, standard form,

00:02:37.597 --> 00:02:40.347
not vertex form or factored form.

00:02:42.066 --> 00:02:44.041
Factored form, as you can imagine,

00:02:44.041 --> 00:02:48.149
is very good for figuring out the zeros.

00:02:48.149 --> 00:02:50.752
Let's do another example.

00:02:50.752 --> 00:02:53.756
And actually this is the same m of x,

00:02:53.756 --> 00:02:55.302
but we're going to ask something else.

00:02:55.302 --> 00:02:58.500
So it's given in those same three forms.

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:01.763
Which form most quickly
reveals the vertex?

00:03:01.763 --> 00:03:04.774
Well I just called this
vertex form before,

00:03:04.774 --> 00:03:07.294
but what's valuable about the vertex form

00:03:07.294 --> 00:03:08.229
is you can really say,

00:03:08.229 --> 00:03:10.099
"Okay, this is going to be,

00:03:10.099 --> 00:03:12.006
"this is going to achieve its vertex

00:03:12.006 --> 00:03:16.155
"when this thing over
here is equal to zero."

00:03:16.155 --> 00:03:17.128
How do I know that?

00:03:17.128 --> 00:03:18.750
Well, once you get used to vertex form,

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:21.061
it'll just become a bit of second nature.

00:03:21.061 --> 00:03:23.991
But if this is a
downward-opening parabola,

00:03:23.991 --> 00:03:27.241
the vertex is when you
hit that maximum point.

00:03:27.241 --> 00:03:28.340
And as you can see here,

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:31.462
x minus six-squared is always
going to be non-negative.

00:03:31.462 --> 00:03:33.009
You multiply that times the negative two,

00:03:33.009 --> 00:03:34.875
it's always going to be non-positive.

00:03:34.875 --> 00:03:36.823
It's either going to be
zero or a negative value,

00:03:36.823 --> 00:03:40.721
so this is always going
to take away from this 18.

00:03:40.721 --> 00:03:43.508
And so if you want to find the vertex,

00:03:43.508 --> 00:03:45.149
the maximum point here,

00:03:45.149 --> 00:03:48.274
it would be the x value that
makes this thing equal to zero.

00:03:48.274 --> 00:03:49.792
Because for any other x value,

00:03:49.792 --> 00:03:51.130
this thing is going to be negative,

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:52.875
it's going to take away from that 18.

00:03:52.875 --> 00:03:54.420
And so you can see by inspection,

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:56.975
well what x value will
make this equal to zero?

00:03:56.975 --> 00:03:58.627
Well if x is equal to six,

00:03:58.627 --> 00:04:00.265
six minus six is equal to zero,

00:04:00.265 --> 00:04:01.507
zero-squared is zero,

00:04:01.507 --> 00:04:02.999
times negative two is zero.

00:04:02.999 --> 00:04:06.040
And so m of six is equal to 18.

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:08.263
So this lets us know very quickly

00:04:08.263 --> 00:04:11.559
that the vertex is going to
happen at x is equal to six

00:04:11.559 --> 00:04:14.141
and then the y value there or the m of six

00:04:14.141 --> 00:04:16.391
is going to be equal to 18.

00:04:17.252 --> 00:04:18.837
You can do it with these other ones.

00:04:18.837 --> 00:04:20.747
The hardest one would be standard form.

00:04:20.747 --> 00:04:23.087
Standard form you could
complete the square

00:04:23.087 --> 00:04:24.604
or do some other techniques

00:04:24.604 --> 00:04:26.762
or you could try to
get into factored form.

00:04:26.762 --> 00:04:29.367
Factored form you can find the zeros

00:04:29.367 --> 00:04:31.524
and then you'd know that the
x-coordinate of the vertex

00:04:31.524 --> 00:04:35.503
is halfway between the x-coordinate
of our two x-intercepts

00:04:35.503 --> 00:04:37.532
and then you could figure
out the y value there.

00:04:37.532 --> 00:04:39.997
But this one is definitely the easiest.

00:04:39.997 --> 00:04:42.044
The vertex form and what is the vertex?

00:04:42.044 --> 00:04:46.309
Well it's going to happen
at the point six comma 18.

00:04:46.309 --> 00:04:49.068
Let's do one last example.

00:04:49.068 --> 00:04:50.936
So this is a different function.

00:04:50.936 --> 00:04:53.421
The function f is given
in three equivalent forms,

00:04:53.421 --> 00:04:55.770
which form most quickly reveals the zeros

00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:58.371
or roots of the function?

00:04:58.371 --> 00:05:00.116
So once again,

00:05:00.116 --> 00:05:03.120
when we're talking about zeros or roots,

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:06.029
if we have, let's say that's the x axis

00:05:06.029 --> 00:05:08.972
and if you have a parabola
that looks like that,

00:05:08.972 --> 00:05:12.265
the roots are, or the
zeros are the x values

00:05:12.265 --> 00:05:14.501
that make that function equal to zero.

00:05:14.501 --> 00:05:18.984
Or they're the x values
of the x-intercepts,

00:05:18.984 --> 00:05:20.528
you could say.

00:05:20.528 --> 00:05:22.521
And so what x values make

00:05:22.521 --> 00:05:24.520
or which one is easy to figure out

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:26.745
when this function is equal to zero?

00:05:26.745 --> 00:05:28.600
Which of these forms, because
they're all equivalent.

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:30.148
You can expand out these first two

00:05:30.148 --> 00:05:32.491
and you should get this
last one in standard form.

00:05:32.491 --> 00:05:36.039
Which one is easy to identify the zeros?

00:05:36.039 --> 00:05:37.519
Well in factored form, I could just say,

00:05:37.519 --> 00:05:40.062
"Well, what makes either this thing zero

00:05:40.062 --> 00:05:41.776
"or that thing zero?"

00:05:41.776 --> 00:05:44.239
Because an x that makes
this first one zero

00:05:44.239 --> 00:05:45.866
or the second one zero

00:05:45.866 --> 00:05:48.791
is going to make this
whole expression zero.

00:05:48.791 --> 00:05:49.685
So you can quickly say,

00:05:49.685 --> 00:05:51.394
"Well if x is equal to negative one,

00:05:51.394 --> 00:05:53.014
"this is going to be zero.

00:05:53.014 --> 00:05:55.776
"Or if x is equal to negative 11,

00:05:55.776 --> 00:05:56.990
"this is going to be zero."

00:05:56.990 --> 00:06:01.508
So this is a very fast
way to find out the zeros.

00:06:01.508 --> 00:06:03.777
This one here, a lot harder.

00:06:03.777 --> 00:06:08.004
You would have to solve three
times x plus six-squared

00:06:08.004 --> 00:06:10.347
minus 75 is equal to zero.

00:06:10.347 --> 00:06:11.848
Do some algebraic manipulation

00:06:11.848 --> 00:06:13.837
and you would eventually
get to these answers.

00:06:13.837 --> 00:06:17.008
So I would rule the vertex
form right over here.

00:06:17.008 --> 00:06:19.506
And this form, standard form,

00:06:19.506 --> 00:06:20.622
the first step I would do,

00:06:20.622 --> 00:06:23.031
is try to get it into factored form.

00:06:23.031 --> 00:06:26.571
And then from factored form,
I would find the zeros.

00:06:26.571 --> 00:06:28.741
So once again, this is
definitely more work

00:06:28.741 --> 00:06:30.553
than if you already have
it in factored form.

00:06:30.553 --> 00:06:32.640
So factored form is
definitely what you want

00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:34.484
when you're trying to find the zeros.

00:06:34.484 --> 00:06:36.010
And here it says write one of the zeros,

00:06:36.010 --> 00:06:37.589
I could write x equals negative one

00:06:37.589 --> 00:06:40.911
or I could have written
x equals negative 11.
