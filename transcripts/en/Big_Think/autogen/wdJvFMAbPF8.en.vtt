and so information packets spread out

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020
and so information packets spread out
 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:54.620
and so information packets spread out
over the size of this room you'd use

over the size of this room you'd use
 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:56.420

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:05.959
more it's fiber-optic you get a lot more
the comparison of fiber-optic with

the comparison of fiber-optic with
 

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:09.080
the comparison of fiber-optic with
traditional copper wire you get a lot

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090
traditional copper wire you get a lot
 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:11.240
traditional copper wire you get a lot
more information a lot more bandwidth so

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250
more information a lot more bandwidth so
 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:12.949
more information a lot more bandwidth so
who knows maybe the aliens are sending

there's two questions that get everyone

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:43.760
there's two questions that get everyone
 

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:46.750
there's two questions that get everyone
of us where did we come from

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:46.760
of us where did we come from
 

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:48.520
of us where did we come from
where did we come from and that's by the

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:48.530
where did we come from and that's by the
 

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:50.500
where did we come from and that's by the
way what the rosetta mission is working

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:50.510
way what the rosetta mission is working
 

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:53.260

of the primary seems to be and said

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:54.650
of the primary seems to be and said
 

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:56.320
of the primary seems to be and said
certainly part of the primordial solar

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:56.330
certainly part of the primordial solar
 

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:58.300
certainly part of the primordial solar
system so by understanding that will

00:02:58.300 --> 00:02:58.310
system so by understanding that will
 

00:02:58.310 --> 00:02:59.860
system so by understanding that will
understand more about where we all came

00:02:59.860 --> 00:02:59.870
understand more about where we all came
 

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:02.350
understand more about where we all came
from and the second question is are we

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:02.360
from and the second question is are we
 

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:06.340
from and the second question is are we
alone could we possibly be alone in the

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:06.350
alone could we possibly be alone in the
 

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:10.360
alone could we possibly be alone in the
universe and to answer those questions

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:10.370
universe and to answer those questions
 

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:13.180
universe and to answer those questions
you have to explore space that's what we

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:13.190
you have to explore space that's what we
 

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:14.770
you have to explore space that's what we
do at the Planetary Society did I

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:14.780
do at the Planetary Society did I
 

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:16.720
do at the Planetary Society did I
mention that planetary org then I bring

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:16.730
mention that planetary org then I bring
 

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:21.100
mention that planetary org then I bring
us up thank you
