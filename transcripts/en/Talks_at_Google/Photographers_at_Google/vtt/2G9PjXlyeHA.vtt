00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:04.450
&gt;&gt;Cliff: Good afternoon, everyone. I wanted
to welcome you to another outstanding Authors@Google

00:00:04.450 --> 00:00:08.900
Talk. Together with the Mountain View Google
Photography Club, we are very pleased and

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:14.440
thrilled to welcome Rick Sammon into our midst.
And Rick is an esteemed photographer and instructor

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:20.570
from his series on the DIY Network to his
extensive library of over 21 books, Rick helps

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:26.660
make photography accessible to everyone. By
removing technical barriers, he lets us focus

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:31.010
on the most important parts of the photography,
which is the emotion and the image contained

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:38.150
therein and not worry too much about tools.
Rick is also the most frequently published

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:43.080
photographer in the world, from based on his
columns for The Associated Press and his other

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:50.780
writings as well. You can follow him on Twitter
at @RickSammon and his website is ricksammon.com.

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:56.960
Today, Rick is going to talk to us in general
about photography. He's gonna do some musings

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:00.900
on the art in general, specifically touch
on a few of his most recent books. So, anything

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:05.880
from lighting to his new work in HDR photography.
And looking at his work, as you can see even

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:10.060
on the screen here so far, it's no wonder
that Canon dubbed him an official Painter

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:16.140
of Light. And, in that case, we also have
a Q&amp;A mic for questions at the end, but without

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:18.270
further ado, please join me in welcoming Rick
to Google.

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:19.740
&gt;&gt;Rick: Thank you so much, Cliff.

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:20.740
[applause]

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:21.740
&gt;&gt;Cliff: Thank you.

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:23.920
&gt;&gt;Rick: I am really, really happy to be here.
This is an honor to be here at the Googleplex.

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:31.159
I'm happy to be, not only a Canon Painter
of Light, but a Canon Explorer of Light. It's

00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:37.490
a lot of fun. Well, I came here to do this
presentation on HDR photography-- High Dynamic

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:41.649
Range imaging-- and this is a high dynamic
range, the picture you see here, where I was

00:01:41.649 --> 00:01:46.189
able to capture all the tones in the picture.
Well, before I came here, I did a little search

00:01:46.189 --> 00:01:52.149
on the Googleplex. This is a really cool place.
I know a lot of photographers are, some really

00:01:52.149 --> 00:01:56.180
big name photographers are invited to speak
here, so I feel very, very proud once again

00:01:56.180 --> 00:02:03.060
to be here. Then I did a search on myself.
I got 80,000 results. Cliff, I have to tell

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:06.959
you, this is the first ever time I did a Google
search on myself. I was surprised, actually,

00:02:06.959 --> 00:02:13.000
at how many pictures. But anyway, so I came
here to do this presentation on HDR photography,

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.819
high dynamic range photography, but then we're
walking around the beautiful gardens around

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:21.830
here and we see all these statues of like
these underwater luminaries, like Jacques

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:26.400
Cousteau and Lloyd Bridges. This is amazing.
So, I thought I'd throw in some pictures.

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:32.950
I've scuba dived all over the world; the Maldives,
Lake Baikal, the Galapagos, Fiji, Australia,

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:39.459
the Great Barrier Reef, Belize, Cocos Island,
all over. This is actually one of the most

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:43.810
dangerous situations that I've been in. One
of my good friends, Hal Schmidt, who teaches

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:49.140
down at the Life Photographic Workshops, speaks
about situational awareness; how you really

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:54.069
have to be concerned what's going on around
you. Well, I was actually on a scientific

00:02:54.069 --> 00:02:58.220
trip. We were studying the fishes and here
you can see one of my fish identification

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:01.980
cards. I wasn't paying attention to what was
going on around me and all these sharks started

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:07.489
swimming. So, are there any scuba divers out
here? Ok, so you have to be sure that, don't

00:03:07.489 --> 00:03:12.440
get so concen-, don't get so focused on your
photography or on the project that you forget

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:16.520
what's going on around you. Actually, this
is a Photoshop trick. I think some people

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:20.651
in the front didn't notice that. Here's the
original shot. I play a lot; I work a lot

00:03:20.651 --> 00:03:26.459
in Photoshop so it's fun. I do work for my
professional work, but I also like to have

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:31.079
fun. I love to have fun in photography and
in Photoshop. And that's, I think, why everyone

00:03:31.079 --> 00:03:36.180
got into photography; why everyone is here.
You got into photography for the fun of it.

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:39.260
So, I like to, when I teach photography, I
like to say, "Let's keep the fun going." So,

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:45.150
I have dived all over the world. This was
actually in Thailand. This is a whale shark;

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:50.989
the largest fish in the sea. It's about the
size of a school bus. This is amazing. It

00:03:50.989 --> 00:03:56.000
just floats gently through the water and eats
plankton. So, it's a very, it's not harmless,

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:01.719
it's not frightening to man at all. And again,
playing in Photoshop. This is a picture I

00:04:01.719 --> 00:04:08.260
created one weekend; a 3-D image using one
of the digital darkroom programs. But, again,

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:14.629
I came here to talk about HDR photography,
but we're walking around and I see these meeting

00:04:14.629 --> 00:04:18.431
rooms you guys have that look like yurts,
right? So, I thought I'd throw in some pictures

00:04:18.431 --> 00:04:24.330
from Mongolia. This is actually a yurt, or
a ger, and again, I want to make this very

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:28.210
educational. I know all you guys are serious
about photography. So, I thought I'd start

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:33.080
out with a basic tip about balancing the light
from the flash to the available light. When

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:40.150
I take a flash picture, the last thing I want
is for that flash picture to look like a flash

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:43.900
picture. I want it to look like a natural
light picture. So, if you look here, you see

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:48.770
the scene is very evenly exposed. We have
no deep shadows. It's the deep shadows that

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:54.800
give away, that give away the fact that the
picture was taken with a flash. But when I

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:59.449
walked into this scene here, this was the
lighting. At the top of these yurts, or gers,

00:04:59.449 --> 00:05:04.460
there's an opening for the smoke to go out
and for the light to come in. So, the contrast

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:10.810
range was really great. You see how overexposed
this is? This is the average exposure. If

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:15.680
I just put the camera with no exposure compensation,
this is the average exposure. All the stuff

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:20.750
on the table here is overexposed and washed
out and the background's dark. So, what we

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:25.710
have to do in a situation like this is we
have to learn how to balance the light from

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:29.289
the flash to the available light. So, what
I did is I had the guide come in there, the

00:05:29.289 --> 00:05:36.520
guide; she just popped in the scene. You can
see it's about five to twelve. I bounced the

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:42.789
light, I had an on-camera flash; I bounced
that flash onto the ceiling. Now, at that

00:05:42.789 --> 00:05:47.340
point, the ceiling becomes the main light
source. If you're just shooting with your

00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:50.800
flash, which is about the size of this remote,
you just shooting with that flash, that's

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:56.349
the size of your light source. So, if you
bounce it off the ceiling, the ceiling becomes

00:05:56.349 --> 00:06:01.400
this huge, big light source. And in lighting,
the larger the light source, the softer the

00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:07.169
light. And the closer the light, also, the
softer the light. So, I had her come in here.

00:06:07.169 --> 00:06:12.240
So, when the guy came in he got all dressed
up, I carried my books with me-- you saw some

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:17.069
of my books in the back-- this is when we
got in there. He's just dressed casually,

00:06:17.069 --> 00:06:21.880
but he wanted a really dignified picture of
himself. So, I go in there, again, test with

00:06:21.880 --> 00:06:25.310
the guide. Whenever I travel, I don't, I never
want to overstay my welcome. Never want to

00:06:25.310 --> 00:06:30.800
overstay my welcome, so I'll either put one
of the students who's traveling with me on

00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:35.520
one of my workshops, or the guide or whatever
in the scene. So, you see this beautiful,

00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:41.190
soft even lighting. It doesn't look like a
flash shot because I balanced the light from

00:06:41.190 --> 00:06:45.919
the flash to the available light. And also,
I think we have a question and answer mic,

00:06:45.919 --> 00:06:50.100
well, question mic over there. I have the
answers. I think we save these, Cliff, to

00:06:50.100 --> 00:06:54.560
the end or can people ask questions during
the thing?

00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:59.699
Anytime. Just yell out the question. So, I
was over in Mongolia, not only photographing

00:06:59.699 --> 00:07:06.669
the yurts, but photographing this festival.
This was magical. We lucked out. Once a year,

00:07:06.669 --> 00:07:14.979
500 soldiers from the real Mongolian Army
get dressed up like the soldiers from Genghis

00:07:14.979 --> 00:07:19.270
Khan's time and put on this revival show.
I mean, this is awesome. You could see, when

00:07:19.270 --> 00:07:23.659
these guys are charging across the fields,
screaming and yelling with their bows and

00:07:23.659 --> 00:07:30.740
arrows and spears, you can see what Genghis
Khan at one time, when he was 27-- 27, he

00:07:30.740 --> 00:07:34.580
owned from Beijing, he ruled from Beijing
all the way over to Europe-- this is amazing

00:07:34.580 --> 00:07:38.430
this guy did this. You can take a look at
his army and you'll see why he was able to

00:07:38.430 --> 00:07:45.509
do this; very fierce warriors. From a typical
standpoint, the first thing I do when I open

00:07:45.509 --> 00:07:51.800
a picture in Photoshop is crop the picture.
I want more attention to be drawn to the main

00:07:51.800 --> 00:07:56.129
subject. So, in this picture, there was boring
dirt on the bottom, there was boring sky.

00:07:56.129 --> 00:08:02.139
So I cropped this picture in like the HD format,
maybe even almost a panorama format, to draw

00:08:02.139 --> 00:08:07.990
more attention to the scene. Never underestimate
the importance of good [coughs], excuse me,

00:08:07.990 --> 00:08:13.419
of good cropping. It will give your pictures
more impact. Also, if you're playing in Photoshop,

00:08:13.419 --> 00:08:19.259
Lightroom, Aperture, whatever, if you don't
crop out that area, those areas that you might

00:08:19.259 --> 00:08:25.270
eventually crop out will affect your judgment
as to what the right exposure is of the main

00:08:25.270 --> 00:08:30.230
subject. So I recommend cropping first. I
have friends who say, "You have to get it

00:08:30.230 --> 00:08:33.839
right in camera, no cropping." But I think
if you crop your pictures, you'll see a big

00:08:33.839 --> 00:08:38.229
difference. Also, try to look for pictures
within pictures. We could just crop this picture

00:08:38.229 --> 00:08:43.279
so we have the lead soldier in the frame.
Go back and look at some of your pictures

00:08:43.279 --> 00:08:49.130
and see how you can crop them, again, to get
more impact. Also, from a technical standpoint,

00:08:49.130 --> 00:08:55.460
I'm setting my camera on AI Servo focus. And
cameras basically have two modes, some have

00:08:55.460 --> 00:09:01.100
more, but one is AI Servo focus, which it
tracks the subject or AI Servo, tracks the

00:09:01.100 --> 00:09:07.040
subject during the motion so when you take
the shot, you get a sharp shot. The other

00:09:07.040 --> 00:09:12.720
mode is One Shot. If the subject's not moving,
leave it on One Shot. If the subject's moving

00:09:12.720 --> 00:09:19.070
like this, you want that focus tracking mode.
It really helps to ensure a sharp shot. So

00:09:19.070 --> 00:09:24.930
we get there, I was teaching a workshop, and
the guys with me said, "Aw, man. Its overcast,

00:09:24.930 --> 00:09:29.760
it's dusty. We're not gonna get any great
pictures." Well, the thing is the overcast

00:09:29.760 --> 00:09:35.450
sky and the dust really added a lot to this
scene. You can see, if you were shooting a

00:09:35.450 --> 00:09:40.620
movie over there, you'd be, you'd shoot before
dawn or you would shoot after sunset and you

00:09:40.620 --> 00:09:45.640
would stir up some dust to create-- to create
this feeling. The most important thing, as

00:09:45.640 --> 00:09:50.040
Cliff was saying, that I try to stress in
my talks is the most important thing is a

00:09:50.040 --> 00:09:54.930
picture, in a picture, is the mood; it's the
feeling, the emotion. It's the idea behind

00:09:54.930 --> 00:10:00.279
the photograph. We could get so bogged down
in all this technical stuff, but think about

00:10:00.279 --> 00:10:05.399
the mood that you're trying to create or the
idea that you're trying to create. So, the

00:10:05.399 --> 00:10:11.250
mood of this was just enhanced due to this
dust. Just another tip here: when you're photographing

00:10:11.250 --> 00:10:16.790
subjects moving across the frame-- you see
this horse on the left-- I left a little space

00:10:16.790 --> 00:10:20.940
over there. What you wanna do is you wanna
leave some space when a subject is moving

00:10:20.940 --> 00:10:26.530
for the animal to seem like it's running into,
or the person or the sports car or the person

00:10:26.530 --> 00:10:31.550
on one of the cool Google bikes outside, is
running into the scene. If I just cropped

00:10:31.550 --> 00:10:35.620
it right up to the nose, the picture would
look funny. The animal or the subject would

00:10:35.620 --> 00:10:41.230
have nowhere to go. So, think about that.
One of my tips-- I have a lot of number one

00:10:41.230 --> 00:10:47.100
tips-- one is the name of the game is to fill
the frame. Well, here you don't always want

00:10:47.100 --> 00:10:51.720
to fill the frame. You don't always want to
shoot tight. You wanna leave some breathing

00:10:51.720 --> 00:10:56.029
room for the subject. Here you see the sun
came out. You can see the difference in the

00:10:56.029 --> 00:11:01.700
contrast range. Here, we can't see the soldier
on the left. We can't see his face anymore

00:11:01.700 --> 00:11:08.339
because the sun came out; the contrast range
has been increased. In photography, it's all

00:11:08.339 --> 00:11:13.329
about seeing the light. Every picture that
I'm gonna show you today has the same, basic,

00:11:13.329 --> 00:11:19.149
main subject. All these beautiful pictures
that I saw on the wall during my quick tour

00:11:19.149 --> 00:11:22.500
of this totally cool location have the same
main subject: Light. We have to learn how

00:11:22.500 --> 00:11:27.950
to see things first, the contrast range in
this scene. Here, this scene has a lot more

00:11:27.950 --> 00:11:34.110
contrast than this. When I'm photographing
festivals or when you're photographing a football

00:11:34.110 --> 00:11:42.310
game in your local neighborhood, or a baseball
game, pray for overcast skies because the

00:11:42.310 --> 00:11:45.510
contrast range is less than on sunny days.
So, the first thing is we have to learn how

00:11:45.510 --> 00:11:50.310
to see the light. The next thing is we have
to know how to control the light. We can control

00:11:50.310 --> 00:11:54.529
the light with a flash, we can control the
light with a reflector, we can control the

00:11:54.529 --> 00:11:59.649
light with a diffuser, we can control the
light by moving the subject into the shade.

00:11:59.649 --> 00:12:04.870
So, seeing the light is the first thing, controlling
the light is the second thing and the last

00:12:04.870 --> 00:12:09.630
thing is working, or playing, with the light
in the digital darkroom. It's all about light.

00:12:09.630 --> 00:12:14.740
And if you look at your pictures that way,
that it's all about light, you'll start to

00:12:14.740 --> 00:12:20.100
really, you'll probably get a higher percentage
of pictures that you like without underexposed,

00:12:20.100 --> 00:12:25.620
deep shadows, underexposed areas or blown
out highlights. So, again, here we have a

00:12:25.620 --> 00:12:30.820
scene with a lot of contrast. When I'm photographing
and when I teach a workshop, I'm thinking

00:12:30.820 --> 00:12:35.519
about this and I try to convey this to the
students that the background is just as important

00:12:35.519 --> 00:12:41.639
as the main subject. So here, I'm trying to
isolate this group of soldiers. If you look

00:12:41.639 --> 00:12:45.740
at the group of soldiers on the right and
the group of soldiers on the left, you'll

00:12:45.740 --> 00:12:51.060
see they're not interfering at all with these
soldiers in the middle. Think about the background.

00:12:51.060 --> 00:12:56.731
And there's another tip, actually, that will
help you see what's going on in the frame.

00:12:56.731 --> 00:13:00.320
I'm gonna ask everyone in the audience here
a question and again, I thank you for coming.

00:13:00.320 --> 00:13:05.209
This is just so cool being here at the Googleplex.
How many people, when they take a picture,

00:13:05.209 --> 00:13:09.250
go like this-- have their left eye closed--
I'm gonna ask, how many have their right eye

00:13:09.250 --> 00:13:15.139
closed? So, how many shoot like this with
their left eye closed? Ok, about half. How

00:13:15.139 --> 00:13:20.750
about the right eye? Ok, Jim, Rose, Buchannan,
what do you shoot with?

00:13:20.750 --> 00:13:24.480
He shoots with the right eye. Well, sports
photographers, and if you're shooting action

00:13:24.480 --> 00:13:29.889
like this, what you wanna do is you really
wanna learn how to shoot with both eyes open.

00:13:29.889 --> 00:13:32.470
It takes a little while to do this. So, you
have your camera up like this and you have

00:13:32.470 --> 00:13:38.680
the other eye open, I'm sure it looks a little
weird on camera, here. But if you do that,

00:13:38.680 --> 00:13:43.940
then you're looking at the action in the viewfinder
and with the other eye you can see if some

00:13:43.940 --> 00:13:49.470
soldiers or whatever's gonna come into the
frame. Try this, but if you're going to an

00:13:49.470 --> 00:13:53.480
event for the first time and you really wanna
get the shots, don't try it the first time.

00:13:53.480 --> 00:13:58.699
Practice this, perfect it. Because after you
do, again, you'll see what might come into

00:13:58.699 --> 00:14:02.649
the frame and ruin the shot, or you might
see what's gonna come into the frame and make

00:14:02.649 --> 00:14:08.709
the shot like really, really cool. So learn
how to shoot with both eyes open. One of the

00:14:08.709 --> 00:14:14.240
things I talk about in my workshops is when
you go to a location, whether it's a festival

00:14:14.240 --> 00:14:17.949
in Mongolia, or walking around the Googleplex,
I'm gonna go back here. One of the things

00:14:17.949 --> 00:14:24.120
that will help you get good pictures is to
try to tell the story. Try to tell the whole

00:14:24.120 --> 00:14:28.910
story. So, here I'm taking the wide angle
shots. I'm moving in, I'm taking is-, pictures

00:14:28.910 --> 00:14:34.600
of the soldiers moving in closer. Here, I'm
taking a shot of the soldiers during a break,

00:14:34.600 --> 00:14:39.300
when they were relaxing cause this is an all
day festival. Try to tell the whole story

00:14:39.300 --> 00:14:46.460
and we can do this by moving in, zooming in
closer, taking wide angle shots, taking telephoto

00:14:46.460 --> 00:14:53.329
shots. If you're gonna put together a gallery
on your website or wherever, what you wanna

00:14:53.329 --> 00:14:57.540
do is you wanna tell the whole story. And
don't forget the details. Details are very,

00:14:57.540 --> 00:15:03.561
very important, so you may wanna come in and
photograph one of the soldier's swords in

00:15:03.561 --> 00:15:07.110
this case. And then again, I'm telling the
story. Now I'm doing the individual soldiers.

00:15:07.110 --> 00:15:13.550
This actually, is a daylight fill-in flash
shot. Once again, it doesn't look like a daylight

00:15:13.550 --> 00:15:17.709
fill-in flash shot because I balanced the
light from the flash to the available light.

00:15:17.709 --> 00:15:23.350
I could tell you how to do it, but it's much
easier if you just go to my website, www.ricksammon.com,

00:15:23.350 --> 00:15:30.529
I have an articles page there. If you go to
the articles page, the first article on the

00:15:30.529 --> 00:15:36.690
left-hand side is exactly about this: daylight
fill-in flash photography. If you learn how

00:15:36.690 --> 00:15:41.360
to do this, your pictures will look very professional.
I mentioned before that I like to have fun.

00:15:41.360 --> 00:15:47.509
I see a couple of smiles here in the audience.
I do like to have fun because the more fun,

00:15:47.509 --> 00:15:53.290
the more fun that I have, the more fun the
subjects gonna have, so I like to get involved

00:15:53.290 --> 00:15:58.560
in the situation. So, what I did here is I
popped on one of these ponies, I got myself

00:15:58.560 --> 00:16:04.420
a little helmet, actually, I cloned it, you
can see it's exactly the helmet I cloned the

00:16:04.420 --> 00:16:10.420
helmet in Photoshop. And then I mentioned
that Genghis Khan was 27 years old when he

00:16:10.420 --> 00:16:16.790
owned from Beijing, when he ruled Beijing
over to all Europe. I figured, hey, I'm there.

00:16:16.790 --> 00:16:22.139
I was 57 when I was there. I'll try to take
over Mongolia. Well, I got dressed up like

00:16:22.139 --> 00:16:27.160
Genghis Khan, but it didn't work. And as Cliff
had noticed there, I was showing him the pictures

00:16:27.160 --> 00:16:31.550
before, they actually, he noticed me riding.
They actually let me ride with them. So I

00:16:31.550 --> 00:16:39.810
do-- no? You don't believe that? Ok, this
is the most important thing I talk about when

00:16:39.810 --> 00:16:45.699
I teach photography. Setting goals in your
life is very important and setting goals in

00:16:45.699 --> 00:16:50.920
photography is very important. We went over
there. Actually, before I tell you this story,

00:16:50.920 --> 00:16:55.990
I was teaching a workshop in Botswana. There's
a guy comes up to me the first day, he says,

00:16:55.990 --> 00:17:01.310
"I'm really excited about this trip." I say,
"What's your goal?" He said, "Well, my goal

00:17:01.310 --> 00:17:07.920
was to shoot 700 pictures a day." I said to
him, "What?" I said, "I can't believe that

00:17:07.920 --> 00:17:13.450
your goal to shoot 700 pictures a day." My
goal was to walk away from this two week trip

00:17:13.450 --> 00:17:21.880
with maybe 18, 22, 24 pictures. Some really
great shots. So, his approach was to use the

00:17:21.880 --> 00:17:24.330
machine gun approach. Just shoot as much as
possible and hope for the best. My approach

00:17:24.330 --> 00:17:32.290
is what I encourage people to do is to use
the bow and arrow approach. Even if you're

00:17:32.290 --> 00:17:37.410
photographing action like this, use that bow
and arrow approach and go for the shot that

00:17:37.410 --> 00:17:44.010
you want. And setting a goal for the shot
you want, again, is very important. So, going

00:17:44.010 --> 00:17:51.320
over to Mongolia, I wanted to get this shot.
Everyone who photographs running horses wants

00:17:51.320 --> 00:17:58.570
to get this shot; all the hooves off the ground,
right? So that was my goal. So, knowing that's

00:17:58.570 --> 00:18:04.600
my goal, I had to ask myself before this,
"What did I have to do?" Well, I had to set

00:18:04.600 --> 00:18:10.320
my camera on AI Servo, that focus tracking
mode I talked about, I had to set the camera

00:18:10.320 --> 00:18:14.380
on rapid frame advance so I could take a lot
of shots, I had to find a subject where it

00:18:14.380 --> 00:18:20.480
had a lot of space around it, I had to set
the exposure before the horse was running

00:18:20.480 --> 00:18:27.170
into the scene so I'm just testing exposures
all around. So, knowing that I had to do all

00:18:27.170 --> 00:18:32.830
these things, in my mind said, "Ok, I have
this goal. Now I know what to do." So when

00:18:32.830 --> 00:18:38.290
I got on site, it becomes, it became my point
and shoot photography. It wasn't that hard

00:18:38.290 --> 00:18:42.150
because I set that goal. If I just went and,
"Oh, I'm just gonna get a shot of this." So

00:18:42.150 --> 00:18:47.720
the point is, if you set goals, if you wanna
do a beautiful landscape, some of the things

00:18:47.720 --> 00:18:54.040
that help with landscape photography is tremendous
depth of field. So you would wanna use a wide

00:18:54.040 --> 00:19:00.770
angle lens, a small aperture and set the focus--this
is gonna sound backwards-- set the focus one-third

00:19:00.770 --> 00:19:06.070
into the scene. Lock the focus one-third into
the scene. So to get a tremendous depth of

00:19:06.070 --> 00:19:12.400
field, again, wide angle lens, small aperture
and focus one-third into the scene. You also

00:19:12.400 --> 00:19:17.400
wanna get up early in the morning and stay
out late at night. Another one of my photography

00:19:17.400 --> 00:19:23.160
tips is you snooze, you lose. You wanna capture
that beautiful, golden light of early morning

00:19:23.160 --> 00:19:28.100
and late afternoon and also, you want to capture
the shadows. Shadows add incredible sense

00:19:28.100 --> 00:19:32.470
of depth and dimension to our pictures. We
see the world in three dimensions; height,

00:19:32.470 --> 00:19:38.650
width and depth. Our cameras only see two.
So it's part of our job, as a photographer,

00:19:38.650 --> 00:19:44.770
to try to create this sense of depth and dimension
in our pictures. Ok, so getting back to this.

00:19:44.770 --> 00:19:47.820
Setting goals in photography is really important.
So I was teaching down at the Life Photographic

00:19:47.820 --> 00:19:54.990
Institute down in Los Osos, California a couple
of years ago and I told them this story. I

00:19:54.990 --> 00:20:00.290
told all the students this story the night
before. We go out to photograph the horses.

00:20:00.290 --> 00:20:05.420
These are my shots, but everybody got the
shots. Everybody on the workshop got the shots

00:20:05.420 --> 00:20:11.330
because they set the goal. I was there just
a few days ago, told the same story and everyone

00:20:11.330 --> 00:20:18.950
got the shot. Again, here we have all the
hooves off the ground; we have nice composition,

00:20:18.950 --> 00:20:22.520
a good exposure. So set goals. And I tell
my son this all the time, too. He's 19 and

00:20:22.520 --> 00:20:26.780
he's in college. I say, "It's really, really
important to set goals." In photography, if

00:20:26.780 --> 00:20:31.980
you just go out and say,"Oh, I'm gonna go
to the Golden Gate Bridge. I'm gonna get a

00:20:31.980 --> 00:20:36.150
nice shot." Well, what kind of shot do you
wanna get? Do you wanna get a night time shot?

00:20:36.150 --> 00:20:41.900
How many people here would have a great night
time shot of the Golden Gate Bridge? How many

00:20:41.900 --> 00:20:45.710
people would like to get one? Ok, a lot of
people raised their hand. Well guess what?

00:20:45.710 --> 00:20:50.650
The best time to take night time pictures
is not at night. It's at dusk when there's

00:20:50.650 --> 00:20:56.720
that little bit of glow, that afterglow in
the sky; that blue glow. On my website, by

00:20:56.720 --> 00:21:02.221
the way, on that articles page, I have an
article on night time photography. So I do

00:21:02.221 --> 00:21:08.040
like to have a lot of fun with my photography.
I don't take myself very seriously, but I

00:21:08.040 --> 00:21:13.821
take my work very seriously. And this is probably
the, one of the, again, a very important thing

00:21:13.821 --> 00:21:20.040
that you want to think about when you're,
when you get into photography. So, these are

00:21:20.040 --> 00:21:24.360
the four levels of learning. We only have
three on the screen. So the first level is

00:21:24.360 --> 00:21:33.150
the unconscious incompetence. We don't know
we're not that good. We get a little digital

00:21:33.150 --> 00:21:34.370
camera, we play around in Photoshop or Lightroom
or Aperture or wherever and we're having a

00:21:34.370 --> 00:21:39.370
lot of fun. We don't know we're not that good,
right? Then, we start to look at other people's

00:21:39.370 --> 00:21:44.690
pictures, right? And this is the second stage,
the conscious incompetence. We know we need

00:21:44.690 --> 00:21:50.610
help. So my guess is that's why some of you
came to the-- actually, there's a lot of smiles

00:21:50.610 --> 00:21:54.030
in the room right now-- so I think there's
a lot of people. How many people feel they're

00:21:54.030 --> 00:21:59.650
at stage number two? Ok, just about probably
90%. So that's a cool stage, we know we need

00:21:59.650 --> 00:22:05.679
help. Number three, the conscious competence.
We know we're good. We go out to photograph

00:22:05.679 --> 00:22:10.720
the Golden Gate Bridge at night. You follow
this tip that the best time to take a night

00:22:10.720 --> 00:22:15.710
time picture is not at night. You capture
the afterglow. You have a tripod to steady

00:22:15.710 --> 00:22:20.870
the camera. You compose your picture so the
bridge isn't cutting the scene in half. That's

00:22:20.870 --> 00:22:24.669
one of the things in landscape photography;
you don't wanna cut the scene in half with

00:22:24.669 --> 00:22:31.231
the horizon line. So, this is good. We know
we're good, but the fourth stage is the coolest,

00:22:31.231 --> 00:22:37.220
is the coolest stage. Before I tell you what
that stage is, imagine this. How many people

00:22:37.220 --> 00:22:46.590
here like Carlos Santana playing guitar? Ok,
Clapton? Ok, name another great guitar player.

00:22:46.590 --> 00:22:47.590
Anybody?

00:22:47.590 --> 00:22:52.960
Who? John McLaughlin? Amazing guy. I saw him
in 1974 with John Luponte, remember him? On

00:22:52.960 --> 00:23:01.400
the, right? He's going like this. He was amazing.
Anyway, let's go to John Luponte. He was a

00:23:01.400 --> 00:23:06.950
jazz violin player. When he's playing those
notes, he's not thinking about what note he

00:23:06.950 --> 00:23:12.330
played, what note he's playing, what note
he's going to play, he's not thinking about

00:23:12.330 --> 00:23:18.850
what key he's in. He's not thinking what John
McLaughlin's doing on the guitar. And who's

00:23:18.850 --> 00:23:22.670
the drummer? I forget the drummer's name.
But he's not thinking about what the other

00:23:22.670 --> 00:23:29.560
band members are doing. He's just doing it.
And that's the fourth stage where you do this

00:23:29.560 --> 00:23:36.000
enough so all this becomes just natural. And
that's really the level we wanna reach to

00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:40.990
where we're just doing it. We don't have to
think. And there's only one way to get there

00:23:40.990 --> 00:23:46.630
and guess what that way is? Practice. How
many people here have read the book "Outliers"?

00:23:46.630 --> 00:23:53.090
Check out this book, Outliers. Basically,
what they guy says is that people who are

00:23:53.090 --> 00:23:57.800
really good at things, including The Beatles,
he mentions The Beatles in there, the people

00:23:57.800 --> 00:24:02.670
who are really good at things have practiced
for 10,000 hours. So, the more you practice,

00:24:02.670 --> 00:24:07.320
and he does a lot of comparisons in the book.
He says the people who are successful have

00:24:07.320 --> 00:24:12.690
practiced for ten thousand hours. So you think
The Beatles were lucky? Well, he talks in

00:24:12.690 --> 00:24:18.120
this book about how The Beatles went to Hamburg
in that cellar or whatever it was called and

00:24:18.120 --> 00:24:22.160
they played every weekend from 8 o'clock at
night to 4 o'clock in the morning. And they

00:24:22.160 --> 00:24:27.701
had to come up with all this, all these different
things. And that's, that really helped The

00:24:27.701 --> 00:24:32.870
Beatles. Perfect their creativity and you
get involved and learn how to play together,

00:24:32.870 --> 00:24:38.920
so they were at this fourth level of learning;
this unconscious competence. So I really encourage

00:24:38.920 --> 00:24:45.330
all of you to go out there and practice. Again,
I came here to talk about HDR photography,

00:24:45.330 --> 00:24:50.871
but I saw some really cool people pictures
in the lobby when I was walking around. Not

00:24:50.871 --> 00:24:56.600
only that, I saw some really cool people and
this is actually kind of an honor for me cause,

00:24:56.600 --> 00:25:01.110
Cliff, I think I might be like one of the
oldest people here at Google. He's going,

00:25:01.110 --> 00:25:07.570
"Yeah, that's probably right." So it is an
honor, but I love, I love talking to people,

00:25:07.570 --> 00:25:13.660
I love meeting people. And when it comes down
to it, I love, I think I love photographing

00:25:13.660 --> 00:25:17.970
the people and people the most. I tell people
that my specialty is not specializing because,

00:25:17.970 --> 00:25:22.700
as you saw, I do aerial photography, I do
action photography, I do wildlife photography,

00:25:22.700 --> 00:25:28.660
I do all these different types of photography.
But when it comes down to it, I really do

00:25:28.660 --> 00:25:35.340
love photographing people. So what I thought
I'd do is share with you my ten key ingredients

00:25:35.340 --> 00:25:39.640
for cooking digital photographs of people.
And all these pictures were taken in Papua

00:25:39.640 --> 00:25:42.040
New Guinea two years ago on one of the workshops
that I was giving. Number one, these are on

00:25:42.040 --> 00:25:52.350
my website, too, you don't have to write them
down. Number one, an interesting subject.

00:25:52.350 --> 00:25:57.570
Never underestimate the importance of an interesting
subject. We were over in Papua New Guinea.

00:25:57.570 --> 00:26:03.140
This guy is actually the security guard at
our hotel. This is up in the highlands in

00:26:03.140 --> 00:26:07.900
Papua New Guinea, but I had seen this waterfall
in the brochure and they were saying go down

00:26:07.900 --> 00:26:12.710
and take a swim. I thought it would be really
cool to put these two elements together. I'm

00:26:12.710 --> 00:26:19.180
a travel photographer and one of the things
I like to do is make pictures. There's a big

00:26:19.180 --> 00:26:24.720
difference between taking a picture and making
a picture. A photojournalist goes out there

00:26:24.720 --> 00:26:30.750
and he or she just takes the picture. But
I'm a travel photographer, so I'm allowed

00:26:30.750 --> 00:26:34.850
to make pictures. And think about that. When
you're out there with your cameras, think

00:26:34.850 --> 00:26:39.410
about making pictures. You're like Francis
Ford Copolla. You're the director of the scene.

00:26:39.410 --> 00:26:43.910
If you put elements together and rearrange
elements, even if you're doing a landscape

00:26:43.910 --> 00:26:48.230
and you move over a little to the right or
left and you're framing the scene with a tree,

00:26:48.230 --> 00:26:53.980
you're making the picture. So think about
that; the difference between taking a picture

00:26:53.980 --> 00:27:01.090
and making a picture. So an interesting subject
is really-- never underestimate that-- that's

00:27:01.090 --> 00:27:06.420
the most important thing, which is why I have
it up there first. Also, you see I have this

00:27:06.420 --> 00:27:10.940
beautiful blur to the water in the background.
When you're photographing moving water and

00:27:10.940 --> 00:27:16.340
moving clouds, use a slow shutter speed. Put
your camera on a tripod. Here, I'm shooting

00:27:16.340 --> 00:27:21.220
at probably a 15th or a 30th of a second.
So, I'm using my Canon image stabilization

00:27:21.220 --> 00:27:27.690
lens so I can hand hold this without setting
up a tripod. When I'm photographing people,

00:27:27.690 --> 00:27:37.110
most of the time, 98% of the time, maybe 99%
of the time, I'm not using a tripod. So, what

00:27:37.110 --> 00:27:40.960
I'm doing is I'm moving all around, up and
down. Speaking of which, one of my really

00:27:40.960 --> 00:27:48.240
good friends, Dr. Dick Zakia, wrote this wonderful
book, Perception and Imaging. There's nothing

00:27:48.240 --> 00:27:55.640
about log, jpegs, white balance, AI Servo
focus, ISO, anything like that in the book.

00:27:55.640 --> 00:28:01.210
He talks about why we like pictures; perception
and imaging. And one of the tips he gives

00:28:01.210 --> 00:28:07.810
in that book is to use your camera as a spaceship.
In other words, just going back to the workshop

00:28:07.810 --> 00:28:11.060
I was just teaching, we had that horse shooting
the--, that horse and rider shoot on the beach,

00:28:11.060 --> 00:28:19.000
right? Say, "Ok, let's try to get this shot."
Well, everyone stands like this holding their

00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:22.320
camera like this; just straight like this.
I said, "Hey, listen. Use your camera like

00:28:22.320 --> 00:28:25.310
a spaceship. Follow Dr. Dick Zakia's advice.
Move it up, move it down, tilt it to the left,

00:28:25.310 --> 00:28:32.620
tilt it to the right." Again, another way,
a simple way to get more creative pictures.

00:28:32.620 --> 00:28:38.140
So, here what I'm doing is I'm getting down.
Just another tip here that actually applies

00:28:38.140 --> 00:28:46.010
to the next image, too. When you're photographing
a person, try to see eye to eye, try to shoot

00:28:46.010 --> 00:28:50.990
eye to eye. When you do that, what happens
is the person looking at your picture can

00:28:50.990 --> 00:28:55.720
identify more with the subject. You know,
I don't know if you have kids, but the kid

00:28:55.720 --> 00:29:00.150
may be running around on the floor or crawling
around on the floor on a little bike and he

00:29:00.150 --> 00:29:05.140
maybe standing up like this taking the snapshot
looking down. Again, if you can get down on

00:29:05.140 --> 00:29:11.480
the subject's eye level, the person looking
at the picture can relate more to the picture.

00:29:11.480 --> 00:29:18.870
The other thing is this. You see I'm pretty
close. Most of these pictures, if not, actually,

00:29:18.870 --> 00:29:24.980
all of these pictures, except one, were taken
with my 24 to 105 millimeter lens. Probably

00:29:24.980 --> 00:29:31.270
set it about the 35 millimeter setting. I
like to shoot close. I like to work close

00:29:31.270 --> 00:29:36.490
to the subjects because the closer you are
to the subject, the more intimate the picture

00:29:36.490 --> 00:29:41.501
becomes for, again, the person viewing it.
So, again, I like to shoot close. When you

00:29:41.501 --> 00:29:48.880
think you're close, shoot closer. Sure, I
could've taken this with a 100 to 400 millimeter

00:29:48.880 --> 00:29:54.160
image stabilization lens set at 400, or I
could of taken with a 70 to 200, set at 200,

00:29:54.160 --> 00:29:59.870
but the picture wouldn't have the same sense
of intimacy as that picture or this is. I'm

00:29:59.870 --> 00:30:05.650
pretty close to this subject. I'm shooting
at a wide aperture to blur the background.

00:30:05.650 --> 00:30:08.330
Once again, the background can make or break
the picture. Here, there are a lot of twigs

00:30:08.330 --> 00:30:14.860
and everything in the background and leaves,
so I blurred them to draw attention to the

00:30:14.860 --> 00:30:22.320
subject. Another tip here, when you're photographing
people and animals; try to get that catch

00:30:22.320 --> 00:30:26.970
light. Get that catch light in the subject's
eyes. That catch light really makes these,

00:30:26.970 --> 00:30:33.570
adds interest to the picture and draws the
viewer's eyes to the eyes of the subject.

00:30:33.570 --> 00:30:39.540
So here, we're deep within the forest, rain
forest of Papua New Guinea and there was an

00:30:39.540 --> 00:30:43.270
opening so I moved the man over there and
I said, "Could you look up?" So, actually,

00:30:43.270 --> 00:30:49.210
if you look at me here like this, I have no
catch light in the eyes, but if I go like

00:30:49.210 --> 00:30:52.690
this you can see the catch light from over
here. Probably a little reflected in my glasses,

00:30:52.690 --> 00:30:56.750
too. But think about that catch light. We
could also add catch light with a flash, we

00:30:56.750 --> 00:31:04.000
can also add catch light with a reflector,
as you'll see in just a couple of minutes.

00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:09.600
Creative crop, I mentioned that one of the
first things I do when I open a picture is

00:31:09.600 --> 00:31:14.860
crop the image. I like to look for pictures
within pictures. This is a nice enough shot.

00:31:14.860 --> 00:31:18.700
By the way, this is taken at what's called
a "sing-sing" in Papua New Guinea. All these

00:31:18.700 --> 00:31:22.490
tribes come together and all the different
tribes and maybe about 15 or 20 tribes are

00:31:22.490 --> 00:31:23.490
participating in this event and they dance
throughout the day and the last tribe dancing

00:31:23.490 --> 00:31:27.820
wins some prize. Maybe they're gonna have
a TV show. You know the TV show we have, like

00:31:27.820 --> 00:31:34.680
whatever it's called. What's that dancing
show on TV?

00:31:34.680 --> 00:31:38.530
&gt;&gt;man #1: Dancing with the Stars.

00:31:38.530 --> 00:31:44.240
&gt;&gt;Rick: Yeah, Dancing with the Stars and now
we got Dancing at the Sing-sing or something

00:31:44.240 --> 00:31:48.160
like that. I think it'd be a pretty interesting
show. So, this is a nice enough shot, but

00:31:48.160 --> 00:31:52.100
here I just re-cropped it, placed the subject
off-center. Some people may like the first

00:31:52.100 --> 00:31:58.750
shot better; some people may like this. Photography
is very subjective. I would say listen to

00:31:58.750 --> 00:32:07.321
your heart, follow your heart. Do what you
wanna do. Ok, next is careful focus. Everyone

00:32:07.321 --> 00:32:11.900
here has an auto-focus camera, I'm sure. And
yes, auto-focus cameras can focus faster--

00:32:11.900 --> 00:32:19.220
definitely can focus faster-- than we can,
but just because they can focus faster, it

00:32:19.220 --> 00:32:24.910
doesn't mean that they always know where to
focus. So, my camera has like 45 auto-focus

00:32:24.910 --> 00:32:31.740
points. If I'm shooting with a long lens set
at F to 8, what happens is if I selected those

00:32:31.740 --> 00:32:37.360
points, what-, the camera might think, "Oh,
this is the subject that he wants in focus"

00:32:37.360 --> 00:32:42.610
Well, if this is the subject, or the element,
that the camera says is in focus, the eyes

00:32:42.610 --> 00:32:47.150
might be out of focus. In a situation like
this, I'm actually selecting the focus point

00:32:47.150 --> 00:32:54.590
over the eyes so I have the most important
part of the picture, to me, in focus. So,

00:32:54.590 --> 00:32:59.120
remember, just because you have an auto-focus
camera it doesn't mean that the camera knows

00:32:59.120 --> 00:33:05.120
where to focus. You see this beautiful catch
light in the subject's eyes here. Well that's

00:33:05.120 --> 00:33:10.210
caused by this reflector that we're using
balancing the light, right? There's an opening

00:33:10.210 --> 00:33:16.710
in the rain forest here, balancing the light
onto the subject's face. Another tip here,

00:33:16.710 --> 00:33:21.290
when you're out there shooting, you wanna
have access to all your gear. I teach a lot

00:33:21.290 --> 00:33:26.850
of workshops. People show up with backpacks
with 37 lenses in them, you know, over the

00:33:26.850 --> 00:33:31.730
shoulder bags with all these lenses and accessories
and flashes in them. Or, like this person,

00:33:31.730 --> 00:33:36.590
shows up with a vest. I'm sure she had eight
lenses in there, 11 filters, 16 batteries,

00:33:36.590 --> 00:33:43.510
3 packs of memory cards. She was going around;
she was missing all these shots. I said, "Come

00:33:43.510 --> 00:33:48.370
on. Lose the vest. You wanna have access to
your stuff cause you don't know how fast action's

00:33:48.370 --> 00:33:53.880
going to happen." What I do is when I'm out
there, I travel with two camera bodies; one

00:33:53.880 --> 00:34:00.760
over each shoulder, one with a wide angle
zoom, one with a telephoto zoom. If I'm photographing

00:34:00.760 --> 00:34:05.970
in the wildlife, on one camera I'll have the
24 to 105 millimeter, I mean stabilization

00:34:05.970 --> 00:34:12.960
lens for wildlife and the other the 100 to
400. When I'm photographing people where I

00:34:12.960 --> 00:34:18.090
can get close, I might use the 17 to 40 as
the wide angle lens and the 70 to 200 as my

00:34:18.090 --> 00:34:24.380
portrait lens. And I have a vest on, not like
this, a much lighter vest where I have my

00:34:24.380 --> 00:34:30.660
batteries and my flashes and stuff like that.
The point is you really want to have access

00:34:30.660 --> 00:34:37.890
to your stuff. Tip number five is you really
want to check your camera settings all the

00:34:37.890 --> 00:34:41.400
time. I'm always changing my white balance.
Sure, we could change the white balance in

00:34:41.400 --> 00:34:46.200
the digital darkroom, but if we have all these
pictures and we're changing the white balance

00:34:46.200 --> 00:34:50.380
and the exposure and all these other things,
it takes time. So, the question is, do you

00:34:50.380 --> 00:34:54.980
guys wanna be in the digital darkroom or do
you wanna be out shooting? So, this is why

00:34:54.980 --> 00:35:01.010
it's the--, it's very, very important, very
important to get the best possible in camera

00:35:01.010 --> 00:35:05.410
exposure. So, you wanna check your settings
so the white balance is right, so your exposure

00:35:05.410 --> 00:35:11.440
compensation is set correctly. Not only to
save you time, but so you don't miss a shot.

00:35:11.440 --> 00:35:17.850
So, number five is check your camera settings.
Seeing the light-- I mentioned before that,

00:35:17.850 --> 00:35:22.500
in photography, it's all about seeing the
light, right? The contrast range in the scene,

00:35:22.500 --> 00:35:27.690
but we have to see the contrast range in the
scene, we have to see the direction of light,

00:35:27.690 --> 00:35:33.750
we have to see the color of light and we have
to see the quality of light. So, in a scene

00:35:33.750 --> 00:35:38.160
like this, the contrast range is pretty great.
The background smoke behind this woman is

00:35:38.160 --> 00:35:44.040
great, so, greater than the light falling
on her face so I knew I had to open up the

00:35:44.040 --> 00:35:49.660
exposure. I knew it was soft light so I don't
really have to control the light with a diffuser

00:35:49.660 --> 00:35:55.030
or a reflector. I know its backlight. So,
it's really all about the light. Learn how

00:35:55.030 --> 00:35:59.680
to see the light. So, that's the first thing.
And the second thing, as I mentioned, is controlling

00:35:59.680 --> 00:36:04.330
the light. So, here, in this picture, I'm
controlling the light with a flash. Another

00:36:04.330 --> 00:36:07.530
one of my flash tips is take the darn flash
off the camera. So, if this is my camera,

00:36:07.530 --> 00:36:13.500
what I'm doing is I have a remote control
on the top of the camera, I have my flash

00:36:13.500 --> 00:36:24.270
off camera with a diffuser on it that I can,
so I can move this flash around. Now, if I

00:36:24.270 --> 00:36:28.970
have a long lens it's a little harder. It's
hard to balance it, but the 24 to 105 millimeter

00:36:28.970 --> 00:36:32.940
lens for people photography is really not
that hard. So, I have my flash with the diffuser

00:36:32.940 --> 00:36:40.290
up here and that way I can control the shadow.
Here, we have a very little shadow over on

00:36:40.290 --> 00:36:45.620
this side of the woman's face. If I had the
flash on camera, you probably would've had

00:36:45.620 --> 00:36:50.570
a really harsh shadow under here. When you're
working with that off camera flash, think

00:36:50.570 --> 00:36:56.260
about where that shadow's gonna fall. Think
about the direction of light and use a little

00:36:56.260 --> 00:37:03.460
diffuser over that flash to soften the light
because, once again, you don't want your flash

00:37:03.460 --> 00:37:08.790
picture to look like a flash picture. We can
control the light with a reflector. This woman

00:37:08.790 --> 00:37:13.610
is posed in the doorway of a hut and here's
a--, well, we moved her out to the side after

00:37:13.610 --> 00:37:18.680
that, but it's the same principle. Here, we're
using this reflector to bounce light onto

00:37:18.680 --> 00:37:23.880
her face. And here, you see this woman over
on the left. She's the same woman that was

00:37:23.880 --> 00:37:29.160
in the picture before. She actually took my
advice. She took my advice and lost that vest

00:37:29.160 --> 00:37:34.500
and she started to get some really good pictures.
We can also control the light with a diffuser.

00:37:34.500 --> 00:37:41.050
On a sunny day, what you do is you hold the
diffuser between the sun, the sun and the

00:37:41.050 --> 00:37:46.680
subject and that diffuser acts like clouds,
like a layer of clouds softening the light.

00:37:46.680 --> 00:37:52.850
We can also combine these devices. Here, I'm
using a diffuser, but I'm also using a little

00:37:52.850 --> 00:37:59.220
bit of flash to add that catch light to the
scene. So, the flash not only adds catch light,

00:37:59.220 --> 00:38:04.080
it adds contrast to the scene and by adding
contrast to the scene, what happens is that

00:38:04.080 --> 00:38:11.200
the picture can actually look a little sharper.
It can also; a flash also brings out the true

00:38:11.200 --> 00:38:13.890
color in a subject. There's one other person
here in the audience who has, actually might

00:38:13.890 --> 00:38:19.930
have a little more grey hair or white hair
than I do, right? He's waving at me. He's

00:38:19.930 --> 00:38:24.720
got actually, probably one of the most colorful
shirts here, too, but if you and I went outside,

00:38:24.720 --> 00:38:30.240
it's a beautiful, sunny day here, right? If
you and I went outside and if we were under

00:38:30.240 --> 00:38:34.680
a tree, if someone took a picture of us, our
hair would have like a little greenish tint

00:38:34.680 --> 00:38:40.680
to it because those leaves are acting like
filters, like a filter. So, if you have a

00:38:40.680 --> 00:38:44.240
subject and you wanna bring out the right
color in the shade, say someone with salt-and-pepper

00:38:44.240 --> 00:38:48.900
hair, or grey hair, you would want to use
a flash. So, a flash can also help to bring

00:38:48.900 --> 00:38:56.120
out the right color. Number eight, use your
plus and minus controls on your camera. When

00:38:56.120 --> 00:39:01.750
I shoot a flash picture, I'm always shooting
on the manual mode. When I'm shooting an action

00:39:01.750 --> 00:39:07.630
shot, if I'm shooting a landscape, I'm using
one of the automatic modes, believe it or

00:39:07.630 --> 00:39:11.970
not. A lot of my friends do this. If it's
a landscape, a cityscape, a seascape; I'm

00:39:11.970 --> 00:39:16.850
shooting on the aperture priority mode. I
can fine tune the exposure with a plus and

00:39:16.850 --> 00:39:21.140
minus control and get to the same place you
can get to on the manual mode, only faster.

00:39:21.140 --> 00:39:26.680
If I'm shooting action, like those Mongolian
horse riders, I'm gonna shoot on the time

00:39:26.680 --> 00:39:31.740
value mode or the shutter priority mode because
I wanna freeze the action. If you're just

00:39:31.740 --> 00:39:36.450
starting out, if someone's listening to this
on YouTube or wherever, I would suggest for

00:39:36.450 --> 00:39:41.170
sure practicing and experimenting on the manual
mode, but after you learn the basics try,

00:39:41.170 --> 00:39:48.860
you can definitely go-- I and a lot of my
friends definitely shoot on the automatic

00:39:48.860 --> 00:39:52.790
modes. So, it's seeing the light, it's controlling
the light and then playing with the light

00:39:52.790 --> 00:39:58.270
in the digital darkroom. Here, I took out
some of the color of the background. I softened

00:39:58.270 --> 00:40:04.280
the color. I'm sure a lot of you know Ansel
Adams. He was very well known for his beautiful,

00:40:04.280 --> 00:40:08.860
beautiful black and white images. Well, he
took out the color from the scene. When we

00:40:08.860 --> 00:40:14.030
take out the color from the scene, we take
out some of the reality, right? When we take

00:40:14.030 --> 00:40:18.920
out some of the reality, our pictures become
more artistic, or more creative. Several years

00:40:18.920 --> 00:40:23.360
ago, when the camera manufactor's introduced
these super saturated films, everybody wanted

00:40:23.360 --> 00:40:29.830
super saturated colors. Well, try taking out
some of the colors and you'll see that you

00:40:29.830 --> 00:40:35.750
might come up with some more creative pictures.
And the last things is, whoops, I must have

00:40:35.750 --> 00:40:39.594
skipped the last thing cause I put the slideshow
together during the delicious lunch I had.

00:40:39.594 --> 00:40:43.310
The last thing is, has, to have fun. So, I
think that slide is probably gonna come up

00:40:43.310 --> 00:40:48.980
in a little while. So, I do a lot of different
types of photography. Wildlife photography

00:40:48.980 --> 00:40:54.250
is also one of my favorite. I mentioned before
telling the whole story. I thought I'd just

00:40:54.250 --> 00:41:00.100
share with you some pictures from this workshop
that I led over in Kenya. In photography,

00:41:00.100 --> 00:41:05.101
planning is very, very important. The group
I was taking, we wanted to photograph the

00:41:05.101 --> 00:41:09.790
annual migration of the wildebeests and the
zebras. And this has this is really the same

00:41:09.790 --> 00:41:15.170
every year. The wildebeests and the zebras
follow the rain around so they have something

00:41:15.170 --> 00:41:19.690
to eat so the carnivores follow them, so they
always have something to eat. They always

00:41:19.690 --> 00:41:25.970
cross the Mara River during the same two or
three weeks of the year and there's thousands

00:41:25.970 --> 00:41:31.230
and thousands and thousands of animals that
do this, so if you get, again, this lasts

00:41:31.230 --> 00:41:37.620
several weeks. So, if you go over there like
late October or mid-October, you'll get shots

00:41:37.620 --> 00:41:44.750
like this. Having a good guide is super important.
We're on the bank of the Mara River, there

00:41:44.750 --> 00:41:51.740
must have been 87, 87 safari vehicles lined
up. He was able to get us right into the shot,

00:41:51.740 --> 00:41:56.720
into position, so we got a shot. So this is
my favorite shot from this workshop; a horizontal

00:41:56.720 --> 00:42:02.810
shot, it shows a lot of these animals. But
I'm zooming in, I'm moving in closer. When

00:42:02.810 --> 00:42:06.980
you're shooting, shoot everything vertically,
shoot everything horizontally. Very basic

00:42:06.980 --> 00:42:11.870
tip, but you don't know what you're gonna
like later or, if you're doing a webpage or

00:42:11.870 --> 00:42:16.530
a gallery or someone wants to buy one of your
prints, you don't know what they need. So,

00:42:16.530 --> 00:42:29.860
if you shoot it both ways, you'll have what
they need. Again, I'm zooming in closer and

00:42:29.860 --> 00:42:33.840
closer and closer. So, the other pic-, oh,
this looks funny on the monitor over there.

00:42:33.840 --> 00:42:34.840
They have two monitors on top of each other,
so it looked like four pictures. Anyways,

00:42:34.840 --> 00:42:37.210
it was kind of, that was kind of funny. So
anyway, these, oh, I hate when that happens.

00:42:37.210 --> 00:42:45.030
But it's just gonna take me a second to go
back. Uhhh, here we go. Got it. So these first

00:42:45.030 --> 00:42:50.630
pictures were taken with my favorite wildlife
lens, the 100 to 400 millimeter and stabilization.

00:42:50.630 --> 00:42:57.560
And for these I used a 2X converter. I have
a friend, we call him Don Juan Ponce, his

00:42:57.560 --> 00:43:02.460
real name is Juan Ponce. He travels around
with these 500 millimeter lenses, right? I

00:43:02.460 --> 00:43:07.900
don't travel with these long lenses. I use
smaller lenses, like the 100 to 400, and I'll

00:43:07.900 --> 00:43:11.560
use teleconverters, or 1.4X teleconverter.
So, I love this teleconverter rather than

00:43:11.560 --> 00:43:17.860
using a 2X and travel with another piece of
hardware, I just crop in a little more. If

00:43:17.860 --> 00:43:23.130
you have to choose one teleconverter, I would
say go with the 1.4X teleconverter. These

00:43:23.130 --> 00:43:30.220
were taken on different times of--, on different
days, by the way, which is why the water's

00:43:30.220 --> 00:43:35.860
a different color. When you're photographing
wildlife, people too, portraits are nice.

00:43:35.860 --> 00:43:41.670
Portraits are nice enough. This is a portrait
of a white rhino. Kinda cool, but a behavioral

00:43:41.670 --> 00:43:47.850
shot is always more interesting. Here we have,
oh, it's gonna happen again. Let me see. Good.

00:43:47.850 --> 00:43:51.110
Here you see, this is called babysitting,
what the guides call babysitting where you

00:43:51.110 --> 00:43:57.360
have this cute little baby giraffe feeding,
getting a little drink of milk from the mother

00:43:57.360 --> 00:44:01.400
giraffe. It's more interesting. All your pictures
should really tell a story. Think about that

00:44:01.400 --> 00:44:08.190
when you're shooting. What story does your
picture tell? Nice enough shot of a rhino,

00:44:08.190 --> 00:44:14.690
but it's really just a boring portrait. Here
is another example of, actually, a lot of

00:44:14.690 --> 00:44:20.010
things going on here. The background, again,
can make or break a shot. This lone elephant

00:44:20.010 --> 00:44:24.900
then, in the background, really adds a lot
of interest to this picture. You also see

00:44:24.900 --> 00:44:30.390
that I cropped this in the high dynamic, in
the high definition format. I also added a

00:44:30.390 --> 00:44:37.950
blue gradual filter in the digital darkroom.
I also placed this lone elephant off to the

00:44:37.950 --> 00:44:41.360
side. Again, think, it doesn't take much.
It doesn't take much to turn a snapshot into

00:44:41.360 --> 00:44:47.520
a great shot if you just think about the end
result; how the picture is going to wind up.

00:44:47.520 --> 00:44:52.900
One of my photography tips, another one of
my number one photography tips is the name

00:44:52.900 --> 00:44:57.540
of the game is to fill the frame. In other
words, you saw in that Mongolian picture;

00:44:57.540 --> 00:45:02.300
I cropped out all this stuff on the top. Boring.
I cropped out all the dirt and the bottom.

00:45:02.300 --> 00:45:05.900
Boring. Well, here we have a male and a female
elephant over in Africa, following the tip,

00:45:05.900 --> 00:45:13.060
the name of the game is to fill the frame.
But, you don't always have to shoot super

00:45:13.060 --> 00:45:18.580
tight to follow that tip. Here, in this next
shot, here I followed that tip; actually,

00:45:18.580 --> 00:45:22.550
the name of the game is to fill the frame
because something's happening in the whole

00:45:22.550 --> 00:45:27.850
picture. We have these elephants off to the
side here. We have this tree, we have some

00:45:27.850 --> 00:45:31.800
nice clouds up here and it looks like these
elephants, the mamma and the baby, are walking

00:45:31.800 --> 00:45:38.330
over in this direction. So, think about that
tip, the name of the game is to fill the frame.

00:45:38.330 --> 00:45:42.700
And for those beginners here, this actually
illustrates yet another photography tip is

00:45:42.700 --> 00:45:48.730
that when you're composing, think about a
tic tac grid, tic tac toe grid over your picture

00:45:48.730 --> 00:45:52.700
and try to place the subjects where the lines
intersect. So here, if you imagine that tic

00:45:52.700 --> 00:45:59.260
tac toe grid, the tree over here, one of the
main elements in the subject, intersects with

00:45:59.260 --> 00:46:04.740
that line. And over here, this intersects
with that line. So try, that's a balanced

00:46:04.740 --> 00:46:11.090
composition and one photography tip, another
one is dead center is deadly, but that rule

00:46:11.090 --> 00:46:18.350
is meant to be broken, too, on occasion. I
have pictures probably I showed pictures here

00:46:18.350 --> 00:46:22.110
where the subject was dead center in the frame.
Another example of seeing the light. This

00:46:22.110 --> 00:46:28.600
picture, it does not have a lot of contrast,
so I can put my camera on aperture priority

00:46:28.600 --> 00:46:35.380
or shutter priority with zero exposure compensation
and probably get a good shot. Well, here,

00:46:35.380 --> 00:46:45.270
that picture was taken after, after. Whoops,
let me go back. Let me get back there. After

00:46:45.270 --> 00:46:51.600
this picture was taken, so this does not have
a lot of contrast and this picture has a lot

00:46:51.600 --> 00:46:56.130
of contrast. Now, if we learn how to see the
light, we know that here, the contrast range

00:46:56.130 --> 00:47:02.120
is much greater than the other one. We have
to do some kind of exposure compensation.

00:47:02.120 --> 00:47:07.811
So, here I'm reducing the exposure compensation
about maybe half a stop, two-third's of a

00:47:07.811 --> 00:47:16.770
stop, so this area around the sun isn't overexposed
and washed out. When I shoot digital, I shoot

00:47:16.770 --> 00:47:22.070
digital like I used to shoot slides. I don't
want the highlights to be overexposed and

00:47:22.070 --> 00:47:23.070
washed out.

00:47:23.070 --> 00:47:27.430
Did someone say something? No, no. There's
a question?

00:47:27.430 --> 00:47:31.500
&gt;&gt;man #2: [inaudible]

00:47:31.500 --> 00:47:36.810
&gt;&gt;Rick: Ok, maybe someone just walking by,
Googling something. Who knows? So, anyway,

00:47:36.810 --> 00:47:43.840
yes, in the digital darkroom we can rescue
up to a stop of overexposed areas. But why

00:47:43.840 --> 00:47:48.540
risk that? Why risk those highlights being
overexposed and blown out? I've seen, I've

00:47:48.540 --> 00:47:52.810
seen pictures of beautiful landscapes, beautiful
landscapes, except part of the sky was blown

00:47:52.810 --> 00:48:02.470
out, or there's reflection on the water where
part of that is overexposed and washed out.

00:48:02.470 --> 00:48:08.350
When you're shooting, it's very, very important
to not judge your picture by the image you

00:48:08.350 --> 00:48:14.170
see on the back of your camera, on the little
LCD screen. First of all, that's a jpeg of

00:48:14.170 --> 00:48:15.570
your raw file, so it's not giving you the
whole tone of range, showing you the whole

00:48:15.570 --> 00:48:23.570
dynamic range. And second of all, you might
have, you might have your screen adjusted

00:48:23.570 --> 00:48:28.210
brighter or lower and some of these screens
actually adjust the brightness of the screen

00:48:28.210 --> 00:48:34.730
for the lighting conditions. You have to absolutely
must judge your picture by the histogram on

00:48:34.730 --> 00:48:40.670
the back of your camera. And again, my articles
page, I have a little thing about the histogram.

00:48:40.670 --> 00:48:45.200
Basically, you have the highlights on-- I'm
looking at it from your part-- you have the

00:48:45.200 --> 00:48:49.980
shadows over here on the histogram and you
have the highlights over here. You don't want

00:48:49.980 --> 00:48:54.630
a big spike over here on the highlights. If
you do, that's reaching the top and you have

00:48:54.630 --> 00:48:57.550
a lot of bars over here on the histogram,
you're gonna lose information there. If you

00:48:57.550 --> 00:49:04.610
have a spike over here on the right in the
shadow areas, a big mountain going up like

00:49:04.610 --> 00:49:10.850
this, your shadows are gonna be blocked up.
You're gonna lose detail. Now, you might say,

00:49:10.850 --> 00:49:16.300
"Well, Rick said that he's underexposing this
about a half a stop or two-thirds of a stop."

00:49:16.300 --> 00:49:21.960
Well, in reality, I'm underexposing it, but
the most important thing is that I'm exposing

00:49:21.960 --> 00:49:27.680
for the highlights. Yes, when you underexpose
you might get more noise in shadow areas like

00:49:27.680 --> 00:49:34.060
this, but I wanna preserve those highlights.
And just a side thing on noise, how many people

00:49:34.060 --> 00:49:39.270
here are concerned about digital noise in
their pictures? Ok, Cliff raises his hand.

00:49:39.270 --> 00:49:44.710
Ok, I'll just share. First of all, with the
new digital darkroom programs, it's much easier

00:49:44.710 --> 00:49:50.830
to get rid of the noise. I'll share with you
something my father said when I first started

00:49:50.830 --> 00:49:54.600
getting into photography. I used something
called, Cliff, you're a little young; we used

00:49:54.600 --> 00:50:00.130
to have this stuff in canisters called film,
ok? It came in yellow or green containers,

00:50:00.130 --> 00:50:05.550
right? [Rick laughs] Anyone here ever shoot
film? Ok. How many people here never shot

00:50:05.550 --> 00:50:12.550
film? Ok, we have a few people who never shot
film. Well, when I started, I was using tri-x.

00:50:12.550 --> 00:50:17.610
This is a Kodak film, it was ISO 400. It was
a little noi-, little--

00:50:17.610 --> 00:50:18.610
[audience member sneezes]

00:50:18.610 --> 00:50:25.200
God bless you. It was a little grainy. We
could push that 400 film to 800 and it became

00:50:25.200 --> 00:50:30.480
even more grainy. So, I'm talking to my father,
I'm going out to shoot something, I say, "You

00:50:30.480 --> 00:50:33.900
know, what should I do? I really don't wanna
push it because I'm gonna get twice the amount

00:50:33.900 --> 00:50:38.690
of grain. What should I do?" He said, "Well,
listen. If the picture's gonna be so boring

00:50:38.690 --> 00:50:44.470
that you notice the grain, it's a boring picture."
The point is, don't worry so much about the

00:50:44.470 --> 00:50:50.750
grain. There are photographers, actually,
who have built their reputation on grainy,

00:50:50.750 --> 00:50:54.960
soft pictures. Speaking of which, how many
people here have ever taken an out of focus

00:50:54.960 --> 00:51:01.100
picture? How many people have saved those
pictures? A few people have raised their hands.

00:51:01.100 --> 00:51:06.920
Well here's the thing about out of focus pictures.
One out of focus picture is a mistake, as

00:51:06.920 --> 00:51:11.900
my friend Jim Rose knows, one out of focus
picture is a mistake, 20 out of focus pictures

00:51:11.900 --> 00:51:22.240
is a style. So, save those out of focus pictures.
Quit strive for in focus pictures. How many

00:51:22.240 --> 00:51:27.840
people here love to shoot sunsets with polarizing
filters? Or neutral density filters? Or warming

00:51:27.840 --> 00:51:34.460
filters? How many? Ok. A few people raised
their hand. When you're photographing into

00:51:34.460 --> 00:51:41.350
the sun like this, when you're photographing
a city scene at night with lights, say, the

00:51:41.350 --> 00:51:47.730
Golden Gate Bridge or the cross Bay Bridge
where you have bright lights, you wanna remove

00:51:47.730 --> 00:51:55.010
all filters from your lens. And here's why.
It may be a little hard to see here, but up

00:51:55.010 --> 00:52:00.510
in this part of the frame here, you see like
a little circle. Can you see that? It's a

00:52:00.510 --> 00:52:06.380
little hard to see, but it's there. That's
a ghost image of the sun. If you don't-- I'm

00:52:06.380 --> 00:52:14.690
gonna use my water bottle here to illustrate--
if you don't, say the sun's over there. If

00:52:14.690 --> 00:52:18.410
you don't remove your filter, what's gonna
happen is the light from the sun is gonna

00:52:18.410 --> 00:52:25.119
come through the filter, bounce off the front
element of your lens, bounce onto that filter,

00:52:25.119 --> 00:52:29.820
bounce onto that filter and create a ghost
image like you see over here. So, whenever

00:52:29.820 --> 00:52:35.750
there's a bright light source in the frame,
in the scene, remove all filters. Yes, you

00:52:35.750 --> 00:52:40.450
can take it out, but especially in a sunset
scene like this, the light, the light is so

00:52:40.450 --> 00:52:48.710
graduated there, it would be very hard to
take it out. Tip is, remove all filters. However,

00:52:48.710 --> 00:52:56.810
if you leave a filter on, you may get a nice
shot like this where you can see some of the

00:52:56.810 --> 00:53:01.850
effect of the filter. Ok, we're gonna wind
up here. I think, Cliff, we have five minutes

00:53:01.850 --> 00:53:02.850
left, 10?

00:53:02.850 --> 00:53:06.280
Seven minutes. I'll bet it's-- seven minutes.
My, they're really strict about time around

00:53:06.280 --> 00:53:09.010
here. Ok, I'll speed it up. I'll talk really
fast. No. I am from New York; I know I talk

00:53:09.010 --> 00:53:13.100
fast, but I'll just give you a few more tips
on wildlife photography. I was teaching a

00:53:13.100 --> 00:53:18.480
workshop over in Botswana. This is one of
my favorite pictures. It illustrates a lot

00:53:18.480 --> 00:53:23.500
of the tips that I've been talking about today.
Name of the game is to fill the frame, expose

00:53:23.500 --> 00:53:25.250
for the highlights, we don't want the highlights
overexposed and washed out. We have nice catch

00:53:25.250 --> 00:53:31.700
light in the subject's eyes. We have a little
bit of an expression. You see this animal's

00:53:31.700 --> 00:53:38.550
looking; something's going on. So, I like
that shot. That shot was like this shot, ok?

00:53:38.550 --> 00:53:43.810
The light wasn't that great. I turned this
snapshot into a much more dramatic shot simply

00:53:43.810 --> 00:53:48.160
by cropping in, using a technique that the
Renaissance painters used, that is, to darken

00:53:48.160 --> 00:53:55.619
the edges of the scene to draw more attention
to the main subject and I selectively sharpened

00:53:55.619 --> 00:54:01.020
the animal. My number one tip in the digital
darkroom is to think selectively, don't think

00:54:01.020 --> 00:54:09.260
globally. In other words, apply sharpening,
apply contrast, apply curves and levels selectively,

00:54:09.260 --> 00:54:14.730
not globally. So, I might even have, actually,
I did sharpen his face more than his body

00:54:14.730 --> 00:54:21.720
and I softened the background. Think selectively.
You could turn a snapshot into a great shot.

00:54:21.720 --> 00:54:28.130
This may look like a pretty boring picture
of some logs here and some trees, but it's

00:54:28.130 --> 00:54:33.780
actually a very interesting picture. We were
driving around and the guide says, "Look!

00:54:33.780 --> 00:54:39.720
There's a lion." So, we're like 300 yards
away, there's a lion right in here. I couldn't

00:54:39.720 --> 00:54:46.320
even see him. I had to get out my super telephoto
lens to be able to see him. When you're travelling,

00:54:46.320 --> 00:54:51.340
work with a good guide. Having a good guide
is one of the most important things. He or

00:54:51.340 --> 00:54:59.700
she will help you get the shots. So, this
is the last day of the trip. We were shooting.

00:54:59.700 --> 00:55:03.650
We were having like a great time. So we came,
we, we go into three or four different camps

00:55:03.650 --> 00:55:08.240
in the Okavango Delta. So, we're flying around
and we land on the ground. Well, we didn't

00:55:08.240 --> 00:55:12.920
land in the water on the Okavango Delta. We
land on the runway, they're shooing the elephants

00:55:12.920 --> 00:55:18.190
away and the guide comes up, he rips open
the door, he says, "Come on guys, come on.

00:55:18.190 --> 00:55:22.369
Guys, you gotta click these lions are mating.
You gotta see this. This is an incredible

00:55:22.369 --> 00:55:27.260
scene." So, I had my cameras ready, the guy
with me was like that girl, right, that you

00:55:27.260 --> 00:55:31.200
saw before with the vest. He didn't have his
stuff ready, so he to unpack and this; he's

00:55:31.200 --> 00:55:36.660
slowing us down. Finally, we get into this
open safari vehicle; we're tearing as fast

00:55:36.660 --> 00:55:42.359
as we possibly can over these like, roads,
these washboard roads, bouncing all around.

00:55:42.359 --> 00:55:48.420
We finally get up to this scene. Well, here's
the lion, right? He really wanted to mate.

00:55:48.420 --> 00:55:51.820
Here's the female lion. She didn't want to
mate. So, they're growling back and forth,

00:55:51.820 --> 00:55:58.010
growling back and forth. The guide says to
me, he says, "You know, this is really intense

00:55:58.010 --> 00:56:03.590
scene. Whatever you do, whatever you do, don't
move fast when you're in the vehicle." Well,

00:56:03.590 --> 00:56:08.080
this is the shot I wanted to get. Like a lo-,
I call this a love bite, where the female's

00:56:08.080 --> 00:56:14.570
biting the lion here. So, I stood up. I stood
up to get the shot. So the guide looks at

00:56:14.570 --> 00:56:19.720
me like I'm out of my mind. He says, "Don't
move," like this, right? And it's so hot there;

00:56:19.720 --> 00:56:25.369
sweat is going down his face and all this
other stuff. So, these lions stopped and they

00:56:25.369 --> 00:56:29.610
started walking towards us. I'm sure you've
seen this on TV, National Geographic, when

00:56:29.610 --> 00:56:35.380
the lions are hunting, they like, arch their
back and they go in low through the grass.

00:56:35.380 --> 00:56:36.810
So they were maybe here, I dunno, maybe they
were 100 yards away and they got closer and

00:56:36.810 --> 00:56:42.650
closer and closer and closer. So as they get
closer, the guide's saying to me, first he

00:56:42.650 --> 00:56:49.860
said, "Don't move." Then he's saying, "Don't
move." Then he's saying, "Don't move." Then

00:56:49.860 --> 00:56:54.470
he's saying, [whispers] "Don't move." Because
the lions were this close. So, I'm standing

00:56:54.470 --> 00:57:01.380
up in the vehicle, well, I have a 19 year
old, he was about 15 years old when I was

00:57:01.380 --> 00:57:06.230
there and I said to myself, "I better keep
shooting." Because if the lions jump up in

00:57:06.230 --> 00:57:11.050
this open safari vehicle and attack me, kill
me, rip my head off, someone finds my camera,

00:57:11.050 --> 00:57:16.130
they might get to my son. My son would still
be proud of me. He would say, "Hey, my dad

00:57:16.130 --> 00:57:18.370
was a photographer right up until the end."

00:57:18.370 --> 00:57:19.370
[laughter]

00:57:19.370 --> 00:57:24.190
So, I'm shooting and I'm shooting and I'm
shooting and their like closer than the front

00:57:24.190 --> 00:57:29.340
row here and I take one more shot and this
was it. They were so tired they laid down

00:57:29.340 --> 00:57:34.880
in the shade of the safari vehicle. You can
see, you can see my shadow there and the guides

00:57:34.880 --> 00:57:40.400
shadow, he was yelling, "Don't move, don't
move." And my other, and the guy who was teaching

00:57:40.400 --> 00:57:43.340
the workshop, too, was there. Well, listen.
Cliff, how am I doing on time?

00:57:43.340 --> 00:57:44.910
&gt;&gt;Cliff: [inaudible]

00:57:44.910 --> 00:57:50.480
&gt;&gt;Rick: Ok, we have some Q&amp;As. If you have
any questions about photography, travelling,

00:57:50.480 --> 00:57:57.070
equipment, things like that, I'd be more than--
and don't be shy. If you are shy, you can

00:57:57.070 --> 00:58:02.190
just go on my website, ricksammon.com, click
on the bio page and I'll be happy to answer

00:58:02.190 --> 00:58:07.840
any questions for you. So there must be some
burning questions you guys wanna know. Wait,

00:58:07.840 --> 00:58:10.840
I think we have one coming up.

00:58:10.840 --> 00:58:17.980
&gt;&gt;man #3: I don't know how burning this is,
but when you do have to change the white balance,

00:58:17.980 --> 00:58:24.222
what technique do you use to get the right
white balance? Do you have separate media;

00:58:24.222 --> 00:58:25.222
or do you have a white card? I mean, what--

00:58:25.222 --> 00:58:26.222
&gt;&gt;Rick: You mean, in camera what do I use?

00:58:26.222 --> 00:58:27.280
&gt;&gt;man #3: Yeah, right. When you want to change
the white balance--

00:58:27.280 --> 00:58:33.080
&gt;&gt;Rick: Right, right. Yeah, there's a device
called a color checker passport and it's basically,

00:58:33.080 --> 00:58:36.710
you've probably seen these Macbeth color charts.
They have all these different charts. So you

00:58:36.710 --> 00:58:42.140
take a test of that and when you go back,
a CD comes with that, and then what you do

00:58:42.140 --> 00:58:46.250
is you calibrate your camera to that lighting
condition and you're all set. And it's about

00:58:46.250 --> 00:58:51.070
99 bucks and you put it in your pocket. It's
about the size of a passport. The ExpoDisk

00:58:51.070 --> 00:58:57.560
is another really good way to do the-- Cliff's
shaking his head and he's heard of the ExpoDisk--

00:58:57.560 --> 00:59:02.920
as long as you do it. But it's more important
to do it if you're working on a scientific

00:59:02.920 --> 00:59:08.400
project. I have a book on butterflies and
the scientists were really strict about getting

00:59:08.400 --> 00:59:13.820
the colors right, so I had to use a device
like that to calibrate, to set the color in

00:59:13.820 --> 00:59:18.680
camera. But if I'm doing my travel photography,
like some of these pictures you see here,

00:59:18.680 --> 00:59:25.880
I'm warming up the pictures so they're a little
more pleasing. Color is very subjective, too.

00:59:25.880 --> 00:59:30.570
And speaking of that, do you make your own
prints? How many people here make their own

00:59:30.570 --> 00:59:39.150
prints or send prints to a lab? Ok. Well,
if we drink coffee, if we drink alcohol, both

00:59:39.150 --> 00:59:45.140
caffeine and alcohol effect the way we see
color. So, and we, we also see color at different

00:59:45.140 --> 00:59:49.070
times of day. So, if you print, my advice
is don't drink and print.

00:59:49.070 --> 00:59:50.070
[laughter]

00:59:50.070 --> 00:59:51.070
Very, very important.

00:59:51.070 --> 00:59:57.500
&gt;&gt;Cliff: So, Rick, this has been an amazing
talk. I wanted to ask you a question on HDR

00:59:57.500 --> 01:00:00.670
photography.
I-- was wondering if you could give me your

01:00:00.670 --> 01:00:09.060
thoughts and advice on it and also, I seem
to remember reading that if you ask the man

01:00:09.060 --> 01:00:10.890
or woman on the street what they think of
an HDR a non-HDR photo, they'll immediately

01:00:10.890 --> 01:00:17.619
go for the HDR one, but then in certain photographers
shy away from it entirely. So, I wanted to

01:00:17.619 --> 01:00:19.920
get your take on that.

01:00:19.920 --> 01:00:25.220
&gt;&gt;Rick: Well, in HDR photography, there's
basically, there's two basic styles. The realistic

01:00:25.220 --> 01:00:31.010
and the surrealistic. My friend, Trey Ratcliff,
who has spoken here, he's into both types.

01:00:31.010 --> 01:00:36.869
I've seen some of his pictures that look real
and some that look surreal. And, once again,

01:00:36.869 --> 01:00:43.880
it's up to the subject. The subject really,
I think, suggests whether or not it should

01:00:43.880 --> 01:00:49.880
be realistic or artistic. Here's an inside
of a car. This, out in Los Osos, California,

01:00:49.880 --> 01:00:52.360
this I thought looked good as a realistic
image cause I didn't want to increase the

01:00:52.360 --> 01:00:59.340
saturation, the contrast and the color. But
in another picture that I have over here,

01:00:59.340 --> 01:01:06.680
if I go down, it looks a little more-- well,
here's a--, actually, here's a realistic and

01:01:06.680 --> 01:01:13.050
here's a surrealistic. So, it's really up
to you. When HDR came out, most people were

01:01:13.050 --> 01:01:16.240
going for the surrealistic with the halos
and all those other things, but again, it's

01:01:16.240 --> 01:01:25.619
the subject. And just one tip I can give you
on HDR photography, it doesn't always, the

01:01:25.619 --> 01:01:29.940
bracketing sequence is not always-- and I'm
gonna find the slide that illustrates it--

01:01:29.940 --> 01:01:37.160
it's not always zero, two over and two under.
So, here you see I'm in the Havana Florida

01:01:37.160 --> 01:01:44.430
Hotel in Old Havana; the zero exposure compensation
setting is on the left. I only had to go two

01:01:44.430 --> 01:01:50.220
stops over to see into the shadows, but because
I didn't want the highlights blown out, I

01:01:50.220 --> 01:01:55.750
had to go two stops under, three stops under,
four stops under. Now, in this picture of

01:01:55.750 --> 01:02:02.440
the red car, it was exactly the opposite because
I wanted to see into the shadows. So, here's

01:02:02.440 --> 01:02:08.530
the average exposure at zero on the top left,
and I only had to go two stops under so I

01:02:08.530 --> 01:02:11.380
preserve the highlights out the window, but
then two stops over, three stops over, four

01:02:11.380 --> 01:02:17.530
stops over, five stops over. The idea is you're
not always zero and you're not always two

01:02:17.530 --> 01:02:20.859
over and two under. Yes.

01:02:20.859 --> 01:02:22.859
&gt;&gt;man #4: [inaudible]

01:02:22.859 --> 01:02:28.040
&gt;&gt;Rick: The question is how did I figure out
how far I needed to go. I'm using the overexposure

01:02:28.040 --> 01:02:32.470
warning on the back of my camera. Basically,
what you wanna do to see in the shadows is

01:02:32.470 --> 01:02:44.560
you wanna have almost the entire back, screen
on the back overexposed and washed out.

01:02:44.560 --> 01:02:45.560
Oh, another question.

01:02:45.560 --> 01:02:46.560
One more question.

01:02:46.560 --> 01:02:47.560
&gt;&gt;man #5: Yeah, this is a little off-topic,
but what's your workflow like in terms of

01:02:47.560 --> 01:02:58.370
how you archive and, in terms of your originals
and then your, your finished work and, and

01:02:58.370 --> 01:03:02.730
stuff like that. Just quick.

01:03:02.730 --> 01:03:08.609
&gt;&gt;Rick: Right. You know what? I have a podcast.
It's called the Digital Photo Experience podcast

01:03:08.609 --> 01:03:13.800
and we're talking about that on our next podcast.
If you go on my site, you'll get the link.

01:03:13.800 --> 01:03:17.550
Basically, what I say in the beginning of
that question is I don't like to talk about

01:03:17.550 --> 01:03:22.680
workflow because my workflow is probably different
than Trey Ratcliff's or all the other photographers

01:03:22.680 --> 01:03:30.580
who have spoken here. What I do in the field
is I have a folder of say, I'm in Botswana.

01:03:30.580 --> 01:03:36.380
And if I have like five different memory cards,
Day One, A B C D. At the end of each day,

01:03:36.380 --> 01:03:41.260
no matter how late I have to stay up, I've
taken the best of the best and put those in

01:03:41.260 --> 01:03:45.530
another folder and I probably won't look at
the other pictures again, unless I need a

01:03:45.530 --> 01:03:52.410
bad example, cause I mess up every once in
awhile. Actually, more than once in a while.

01:03:52.410 --> 01:03:55.460
But at the end of the day, I have a folder,
best of the best. Then, if it's just a standard,

01:03:55.460 --> 01:04:01.470
if it's standard photography, I'll go into
Adobe Camera Raw and work on rescuing those

01:04:01.470 --> 01:04:07.760
highlights if need be, or using all the different
sliders there to get the best possible picture

01:04:07.760 --> 01:04:13.530
there. But again, as far as the work flow,
it's HDR it's different. I might be using

01:04:13.530 --> 01:04:17.700
some plug-ins or whatever. But check out the
podcast, the Digital Photo Experience podcast.

01:04:17.700 --> 01:04:18.800
We answer that question.

01:04:18.800 --> 01:04:23.580
&gt;&gt;Cliff: And we'll have some time at the end
if you wanna ask Rick any questions directly.

01:04:23.580 --> 01:04:28.310
So, at this time, I want to thank you for
speaking with us. It was an amazing talk.

01:04:28.310 --> 01:04:31.790
Thanks for exploring the light with us here
at Google.

01:04:31.790 --> 01:04:34.570
&gt;&gt;Rick: Thank you so much, guys. Thank you,
thank you. You were great.

01:04:34.570 --> 01:04:35.570
[applause]

01:04:35.570 --> 01:04:35.790
And the food was great.
