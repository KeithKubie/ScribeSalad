00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.170
systems they have different pressures on
them some have a lot more pressure than

they go to these meetings around the war
 

00:02:11.319 --> 00:02:13.830
they go to these meetings around the war
world interestingly enough there are

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:13.840
world interestingly enough there are
 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:15.660
world interestingly enough there are
probably more constraints on the

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:15.670
probably more constraints on the
 

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:17.759
probably more constraints on the
Democratic leaders than there are on

00:02:17.759 --> 00:02:17.769
Democratic leaders than there are on
 

00:02:17.769 --> 00:02:19.610
Democratic leaders than there are on
those that come from more autocratic

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:19.620
those that come from more autocratic

political pressures at the same level in

00:02:25.619 --> 00:02:25.629
political pressures at the same level in
 

00:02:25.629 --> 00:02:28.770
political pressures at the same level in
some cases but in any case I think it's

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:28.780
some cases but in any case I think it's
 

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:30.179
some cases but in any case I think it's
important to remember that when you have

00:02:30.179 --> 00:02:30.189
important to remember that when you have
 

00:02:30.189 --> 00:02:32.399
important to remember that when you have
20 liters coming to a meeting like this

00:02:32.399 --> 00:02:32.409
20 liters coming to a meeting like this
 

00:02:32.409 --> 00:02:34.619
20 liters coming to a meeting like this
you're not going to have just one agenda

00:02:34.619 --> 00:02:34.629
you're not going to have just one agenda
 

00:02:34.629 --> 00:02:38.369
you're not going to have just one agenda
you're going to have 20 agendas and the

00:02:38.369 --> 00:02:38.379
you're going to have 20 agendas and the
 

00:02:38.379 --> 00:02:40.530
you're going to have 20 agendas and the
challenge in many respects is how do we

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:40.540
challenge in many respects is how do we
 

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:43.470
challenge in many respects is how do we
distill all these various interests and

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:43.480
distill all these various interests and
 

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:47.159
distill all these various interests and
agendas down to one thing one agenda

00:02:47.159 --> 00:02:47.169
agendas down to one thing one agenda
 

00:02:47.169 --> 00:02:50.490
agendas down to one thing one agenda
that everyone can agree on and that can

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:50.500
that everyone can agree on and that can
 

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:52.800
that everyone can agree on and that can
serve as the basis for action moving

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:52.810
serve as the basis for action moving
 

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:55.849
serve as the basis for action moving
forward and it's the question actually

00:02:55.849 --> 00:02:55.859
forward and it's the question actually
 

00:02:55.859 --> 00:02:58.589
forward and it's the question actually
distillation it may be rather than we

00:02:58.589 --> 00:02:58.599
distillation it may be rather than we
 

00:02:58.599 --> 00:03:01.140
distillation it may be rather than we
need to synthesize you'll find in terms

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:01.150
need to synthesize you'll find in terms
 

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:03.300
need to synthesize you'll find in terms
of our presenters and some of the

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:03.310
of our presenters and some of the
 

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:05.099
of our presenters and some of the
written materials that are available to

00:03:05.099 --> 00:03:05.109
written materials that are available to
 

00:03:05.109 --> 00:03:07.699
written materials that are available to
you there are there are very different

00:03:07.699 --> 00:03:07.709
you there are there are very different
 

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:10.050
you there are there are very different
proposals about the best way to move

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:10.060
proposals about the best way to move
 

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:12.390
proposals about the best way to move
forward and so it's going to be very

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:12.400
forward and so it's going to be very
 

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:15.599
forward and so it's going to be very
thought-provoking I think what kind of

00:03:15.599 --> 00:03:15.609
thought-provoking I think what kind of
 

00:03:15.609 --> 00:03:18.449
thought-provoking I think what kind of
constraints are there on on agreement or

00:03:18.449 --> 00:03:18.459
constraints are there on on agreement or
 

00:03:18.459 --> 00:03:20.719
constraints are there on on agreement or
on moving forward to renew globalization

00:03:20.719 --> 00:03:20.729
on moving forward to renew globalization
 

00:03:20.729 --> 00:03:23.729
on moving forward to renew globalization
there are institutional constraints and

00:03:23.729 --> 00:03:23.739
there are institutional constraints and
 

00:03:23.739 --> 00:03:25.679
there are institutional constraints and
you'll hear some about that their

00:03:25.679 --> 00:03:25.689
you'll hear some about that their
 

00:03:25.689 --> 00:03:27.629
you'll hear some about that their
political constraints that's pretty

00:03:27.629 --> 00:03:27.639
political constraints that's pretty
 

00:03:27.639 --> 00:03:29.990
political constraints that's pretty
obvious I think and there are also

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:30.000
obvious I think and there are also
 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.240
obvious I think and there are also
psychological constraints for how we can

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:33.250
psychological constraints for how we can
 

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:35.189
psychological constraints for how we can
even talk about some of these issues

00:03:35.189 --> 00:03:35.199
even talk about some of these issues
 

00:03:35.199 --> 00:03:40.379
even talk about some of these issues
that are so complex in a rational way do

00:03:40.379 --> 00:03:40.389
that are so complex in a rational way do
 

00:03:40.389 --> 00:03:42.689
that are so complex in a rational way do
we need a societal or international

00:03:42.689 --> 00:03:42.699
we need a societal or international
 

00:03:42.699 --> 00:03:45.030
we need a societal or international
consensus for example about levels of

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:45.040
consensus for example about levels of
 

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:47.189
consensus for example about levels of
risk you're going to hear a lot about

00:03:47.189 --> 00:03:47.199
risk you're going to hear a lot about
 

00:03:47.199 --> 00:03:49.499
risk you're going to hear a lot about
risk in the next several days is this

the market system or the risks that are
 

00:03:56.169 --> 00:03:59.039
the market system or the risks that are
inherent in the market system but what

00:03:59.039 --> 00:03:59.049
inherent in the market system but what

you're going to hear from our panelists
and and also perhaps in some of the

and and also perhaps in some of the
 

00:04:02.739 --> 00:04:05.849
and and also perhaps in some of the
discussion is about the risks to the

00:04:05.849 --> 00:04:05.859
discussion is about the risks to the
 

00:04:05.859 --> 00:04:09.179
discussion is about the risks to the
market system and are their actions that

market system and are their actions that
 

00:04:09.189 --> 00:04:11.819

enterprise market system and could do
 

00:04:16.539 --> 00:04:20.729
enterprise market system and could do
harm to that system politicians often

00:04:20.729 --> 00:04:20.739

talk about eliminating

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:23.260
talk about eliminating
 

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:26.370
talk about eliminating
risk I think you've all heard that in

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:26.380
risk I think you've all heard that in
 

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:28.650
risk I think you've all heard that in
the news well economists know that if

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:28.660
the news well economists know that if
 

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:31.110
the news well economists know that if
you eliminate risk you're also going to

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:31.120
you eliminate risk you're also going to
 

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:34.770
you eliminate risk you're also going to
eliminate growth and progress and the

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:34.780
eliminate growth and progress and the
 

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:36.630
eliminate growth and progress and the
question is finding the right balance

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:36.640
question is finding the right balance
 

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:39.510
question is finding the right balance
you can you really can eliminate risk in

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:39.520
you can you really can eliminate risk in
 

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:42.180
you can you really can eliminate risk in
a system but there is a cost to doing

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:42.190
a system but there is a cost to doing
 

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:44.460
a system but there is a cost to doing
that and we have to identify what those

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:44.470
that and we have to identify what those
 

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:47.100
that and we have to identify what those
costs are and then determine how much

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:47.110
costs are and then determine how much
 

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:49.560
costs are and then determine how much
risk we want to accept in order to

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:49.570
risk we want to accept in order to
 

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:51.620
risk we want to accept in order to
achieve the maximum amount of progress

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:51.630
achieve the maximum amount of progress
 

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:54.870
achieve the maximum amount of progress
there are important issues of psychology

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:54.880
there are important issues of psychology
 

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:58.890
there are important issues of psychology
of equity involved in this discussion

00:04:58.890 --> 00:04:58.900
of equity involved in this discussion
 

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:02.070

and hopefully we can get into some of

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:02.080
and hopefully we can get into some of
 

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:04.980
and hopefully we can get into some of
that in greater detail but the question

00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:04.990
that in greater detail but the question
 

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:06.600
that in greater detail but the question
is how can we have an intelligent

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:06.610
is how can we have an intelligent
 

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:09.300
is how can we have an intelligent
conversation about risk and how to

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:09.310
conversation about risk and how to
 

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:12.030
conversation about risk and how to
manage risk in the international system

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:12.040
manage risk in the international system
 

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:15.030
manage risk in the international system
and in the economic system and then

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:15.040
and in the economic system and then
 

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:17.250
and in the economic system and then

this is one on which I think you'll find
 

00:05:18.850 --> 00:05:21.480
this is one on which I think you'll find
all of your panelists here agreeing is

00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:21.490
all of your panelists here agreeing is
 

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:23.670
all of your panelists here agreeing is
that one of the biggest threats to the

00:05:23.670 --> 00:05:23.680
that one of the biggest threats to the
 

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:25.620
that one of the biggest threats to the
renewal of globalization is the

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:25.630
renewal of globalization is the
 

00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:29.730
renewal of globalization is the
resurgence of protectionism and this is

00:05:29.730 --> 00:05:29.740
resurgence of protectionism and this is
 

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:32.310
resurgence of protectionism and this is
actually a bigger question it's

00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:32.320
actually a bigger question it's
 

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:34.620
actually a bigger question it's
presented most often as pressure from

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:34.630
presented most often as pressure from
 

00:05:34.630 --> 00:05:38.520
presented most often as pressure from
from labor unions or from firms but but

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:38.530
from labor unions or from firms but but
 

00:05:38.530 --> 00:05:40.440
from labor unions or from firms but but
I think the bigger question is how do we

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:40.450
I think the bigger question is how do we
 

00:05:40.450 --> 00:05:43.650
I think the bigger question is how do we

Dwight Eisenhower's old idea that if you

Dwight Eisenhower's old idea that if you

meet a problem that you can't deal with

00:08:14.170 --> 00:08:14.180
meet a problem that you can't deal with

the proper solution is to enlarge the

00:08:17.890 --> 00:08:17.900
the proper solution is to enlarge the
 

00:08:17.900 --> 00:08:20.890
the proper solution is to enlarge the
problem so that you bring more people

00:08:20.890 --> 00:08:20.900
problem so that you bring more people
 

00:08:20.900 --> 00:08:24.130
problem so that you bring more people
into more people are involved in dealing

00:08:24.130 --> 00:08:24.140
into more people are involved in dealing
 

00:08:24.140 --> 00:08:27.250
into more people are involved in dealing
with that problem and so this would be

00:08:27.250 --> 00:08:27.260
with that problem and so this would be
 

00:08:27.260 --> 00:08:30.850
with that problem and so this would be
the the big government solution if you

00:08:30.850 --> 00:08:30.860

was a really nice experiment done years

00:40:09.120 --> 00:40:09.130
was a really nice experiment done years
 

00:40:09.130 --> 00:40:12.900

ago by Roth and Myrna Han they took two

00:40:12.900 --> 00:40:12.910
ago by Roth and Myrna Han they took two
 

00:40:12.910 --> 00:40:15.090
ago by Roth and Myrna Han they took two
people and they said here are 20 tokens

00:40:15.090 --> 00:40:15.100
people and they said here are 20 tokens
 

00:40:15.100 --> 00:40:17.400
people and they said here are 20 tokens
and one of these tokens is going to win

00:40:17.400 --> 00:40:17.410
and one of these tokens is going to win
 

00:40:17.410 --> 00:40:19.980
and one of these tokens is going to win
a prize your task is to divide these

00:40:19.980 --> 00:40:19.990
a prize your task is to divide these
 

00:40:19.990 --> 00:40:21.900
a prize your task is to divide these
tokens between the two of you and if you

00:40:21.900 --> 00:40:21.910
tokens between the two of you and if you
 

00:40:21.910 --> 00:40:23.490

can divide the tokens between the two of
 

00:40:23.500 --> 00:40:26.190
can divide the tokens between the two of
you then we'll hold the will hold the

00:40:26.190 --> 00:40:26.200
you then we'll hold the will hold the
 

00:40:26.200 --> 00:40:27.480
you then we'll hold the will hold the
lottery and one of you will get the

00:40:27.480 --> 00:40:27.490
lottery and one of you will get the
 

00:40:27.490 --> 00:40:31.200
lottery and one of you will get the
prize the rub was that for one person

00:40:31.200 --> 00:40:31.210
prize the rub was that for one person
 

00:40:31.210 --> 00:40:34.380
prize the rub was that for one person
the prize was five dollars and for the

00:40:34.380 --> 00:40:34.390
the prize was five dollars and for the
 

00:40:34.390 --> 00:40:36.150
the prize was five dollars and for the
other person the prize was twenty

00:40:36.150 --> 00:40:36.160
other person the prize was twenty
 

00:40:36.160 --> 00:40:40.230
other person the prize was twenty
dollars now so the

00:40:40.230 --> 00:40:40.240
dollars now so the
 

00:40:40.240 --> 00:40:41.700
dollars now so the
think about it from the perspective of

00:40:41.700 --> 00:40:41.710
think about it from the perspective of
 

00:40:41.710 --> 00:40:43.650
think about it from the perspective of
the person who's going to win twenty

00:40:43.650 --> 00:40:43.660
the person who's going to win twenty
 

00:40:43.660 --> 00:40:45.990
the person who's going to win twenty
dollars what's the natural way to divide

00:40:45.990 --> 00:40:46.000
dollars what's the natural way to divide
 

00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:48.330
dollars what's the natural way to divide
the tokens well the natural ways each of

00:40:48.330 --> 00:40:48.340
the tokens well the natural ways each of
 

00:40:48.340 --> 00:40:50.910
the tokens well the natural ways each of
us should get 10 tokens right isn't that

00:40:50.910 --> 00:40:50.920
us should get 10 tokens right isn't that
 

00:40:50.920 --> 00:40:52.800
us should get 10 tokens right isn't that
what's fair divide the tokens equally

00:40:52.800 --> 00:40:52.810
what's fair divide the tokens equally
 

00:40:52.810 --> 00:40:54.810
what's fair divide the tokens equally
well the person who was going to get

00:40:54.810 --> 00:40:54.820
well the person who was going to get
 

00:40:54.820 --> 00:40:56.220
well the person who was going to get
five dollars if they won the lottery

00:40:56.220 --> 00:40:56.230
five dollars if they won the lottery
 

00:40:56.230 --> 00:40:58.680
five dollars if they won the lottery
said the natural way to divide the

00:40:58.680 --> 00:40:58.690
said the natural way to divide the
 

00:40:58.690 --> 00:41:01.410
said the natural way to divide the
tokens is that we each have an expected

00:41:01.410 --> 00:41:01.420
tokens is that we each have an expected
 

00:41:01.420 --> 00:41:03.210
tokens is that we each have an expected
value of winning so I should get a lot

00:41:03.210 --> 00:41:03.220
value of winning so I should get a lot
 

00:41:03.220 --> 00:41:05.970
value of winning so I should get a lot
more tokens to equalize our expected

00:41:05.970 --> 00:41:05.980
more tokens to equalize our expected
 

00:41:05.980 --> 00:41:08.730
more tokens to equalize our expected
value of winning and so it was this

00:41:08.730 --> 00:41:08.740
value of winning and so it was this
 

00:41:08.740 --> 00:41:10.560
value of winning and so it was this
difference between the two parties that

00:41:10.560 --> 00:41:10.570
difference between the two parties that
 

00:41:10.570 --> 00:41:12.090
difference between the two parties that
made it very difficult for them to

00:41:12.090 --> 00:41:12.100
made it very difficult for them to
 

00:41:12.100 --> 00:41:14.730
made it very difficult for them to
settle the settle this very simple

00:41:14.730 --> 00:41:14.740
settle the settle this very simple
 

00:41:14.740 --> 00:41:17.700
settle the settle this very simple
negotiation and I think this is a

00:41:17.700 --> 00:41:17.710
negotiation and I think this is a
 

00:41:17.710 --> 00:41:20.940
negotiation and I think this is a
metaphor for climate change if if people

00:41:20.940 --> 00:41:20.950
metaphor for climate change if if people
 

00:41:20.950 --> 00:41:22.500
metaphor for climate change if if people
have a hard time solving that problem

00:41:22.500 --> 00:41:22.510
have a hard time solving that problem
 

00:41:22.510 --> 00:41:24.870
have a hard time solving that problem
with a bunch of all they have to do is

00:41:24.870 --> 00:41:24.880
with a bunch of all they have to do is
 

00:41:24.880 --> 00:41:26.450
with a bunch of all they have to do is
split tokens and there's two prizes

00:41:26.450 --> 00:41:26.460
split tokens and there's two prizes
 

00:41:26.460 --> 00:41:29.700
split tokens and there's two prizes
think about the difficulty of trying to

00:41:29.700 --> 00:41:29.710
think about the difficulty of trying to
 

00:41:29.710 --> 00:41:33.660
think about the difficulty of trying to
decide on emission caps for different

00:41:33.660 --> 00:41:33.670
decide on emission caps for different
 

00:41:33.670 --> 00:41:36.630
decide on emission caps for different
countries of the world so China is going

countries of the world so China is going
to say you know we're still we're

to say you know we're still we're
 

00:41:38.950 --> 00:41:43.170
to say you know we're still we're
growing but we're still poor and you us

00:41:43.170 --> 00:41:43.180
growing but we're still poor and you us
 

00:41:43.180 --> 00:41:44.970
growing but we're still poor and you us
you've been polluting for years and

00:41:44.970 --> 00:41:44.980
you've been polluting for years and
 

00:41:44.980 --> 00:41:46.890
you've been polluting for years and
years its part the part of the reason

00:41:46.890 --> 00:41:46.900
years its part the part of the reason
 

00:41:46.900 --> 00:41:49.920
years its part the part of the reason
why you're so rich why should we limit

00:41:49.920 --> 00:41:49.930
why you're so rich why should we limit
 

00:41:49.930 --> 00:41:51.960
why you're so rich why should we limit
our emissions at all it's our turn you

00:41:51.960 --> 00:41:51.970
our emissions at all it's our turn you
 

00:41:51.970 --> 00:41:53.730
our emissions at all it's our turn you
should do all of the you should look mom

00:41:53.730 --> 00:41:53.740
should do all of the you should look mom
 

00:41:53.740 --> 00:41:55.590
should do all of the you should look mom
do all the work of limiting emissions

00:41:55.590 --> 00:41:55.600
do all the work of limiting emissions
 

00:41:55.600 --> 00:41:58.620
do all the work of limiting emissions
and the u.s. is going to say forget it

00:41:58.620 --> 00:41:58.630
and the u.s. is going to say forget it
 

00:41:58.630 --> 00:42:00.300
and the u.s. is going to say forget it
you know we're not coming to the table

00:42:00.300 --> 00:42:00.310
you know we're not coming to the table
 

00:42:00.310 --> 00:42:02.910
you know we're not coming to the table
unless everybody limit submissions and

00:42:02.910 --> 00:42:02.920
unless everybody limit submissions and
 

00:42:02.920 --> 00:42:05.990
unless everybody limit submissions and
so these self-serving biases are

00:42:05.990 --> 00:42:06.000
so these self-serving biases are
 

00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:08.640
so these self-serving biases are
probably the I would say are probably

00:42:08.640 --> 00:42:08.650
probably the I would say are probably
 

00:42:08.650 --> 00:42:11.340
probably the I would say are probably

the same time however that on a
self-serving bias it may be the main

00:42:22.710 --> 00:42:22.720
self-serving bias it may be the main
 

00:42:22.720 --> 00:42:24.990
self-serving bias it may be the main
impediment to solve and global climate

00:42:24.990 --> 00:42:25.000
impediment to solve and global climate

impediment to solve and global climate
change it also maybe offer the main

change it also maybe offer the main
 

00:42:27.280 --> 00:42:30.570
change it also maybe offer the main
solution and here's the reason when

00:42:30.570 --> 00:42:30.580
solution and here's the reason when
 

00:42:30.580 --> 00:42:32.430
solution and here's the reason when
people view things in self-serving terms

00:42:32.430 --> 00:42:32.440
people view things in self-serving terms
 

00:42:32.440 --> 00:42:34.050
people view things in self-serving terms
they tend to think that their

they tend to think that their
 

00:42:34.060 --> 00:42:36.480
they tend to think that their

that would be shared by a third party so

00:42:39.240 --> 00:42:39.250
that would be shared by a third party so
 

00:42:39.250 --> 00:42:41.340
that would be shared by a third party so
the fight the person who's getting five

the fight the person who's getting five
 

00:42:41.350 --> 00:42:43.590
the fight the person who's getting five
dollars would think that anybody would

dollars would think that anybody would
 

00:42:43.600 --> 00:42:45.630
dollars would think that anybody would
say it's fair to equalize expected

00:42:45.630 --> 00:42:45.640
say it's fair to equalize expected
 

00:42:45.640 --> 00:42:48.720
say it's fair to equalize expected
values the person who is getting twenty

fair to split the tips

00:42:52.870 --> 00:42:52.880
fair to split the tips
 

00:42:52.880 --> 00:42:56.710
fair to split the tips
10 tips for each person and the result

00:42:56.710 --> 00:42:56.720
10 tips for each person and the result
 

00:42:56.720 --> 00:42:58.240
10 tips for each person and the result

so I believe that the main problem of a

so I believe that the main problem of a
 

00:43:17.869 --> 00:43:21.720
so I believe that the main problem of a
self-serving bias the main problem

00:43:21.720 --> 00:43:21.730
self-serving bias the main problem
 

00:43:21.730 --> 00:43:23.890
self-serving bias the main problem
involving climate change is the

00:43:23.890 --> 00:43:23.900
involving climate change is the
 

00:43:23.900 --> 00:43:26.200
involving climate change is the
self-serving bias but it also offers the

self-serving bias but it also offers the
 

00:43:26.210 --> 00:43:28.059
self-serving bias but it also offers the
solution which is the self-serving bias

00:43:28.059 --> 00:43:28.069
solution which is the self-serving bias

interesting in the book and and one of
the things that it emphasized for me was

00:43:50.499 --> 00:43:50.509
the things that it emphasized for me was
 

00:43:50.509 --> 00:43:54.190
the things that it emphasized for me was
just the importance of trying for all of

00:43:54.190 --> 00:43:54.200
just the importance of trying for all of
 

00:43:54.200 --> 00:43:58.059
just the importance of trying for all of
us to try to expand our perspectives to

00:43:58.059 --> 00:43:58.069
us to try to expand our perspectives to
 

00:43:58.069 --> 00:44:00.099
us to try to expand our perspectives to
the greatest possible extent so that we

00:44:00.099 --> 00:44:00.109
the greatest possible extent so that we
 

00:44:00.109 --> 00:44:03.700
the greatest possible extent so that we
understand the biases and the the needs

00:44:03.700 --> 00:44:03.710
understand the biases and the the needs
 

00:44:03.710 --> 00:44:06.549

of others and can try to incorporate
those into any of the solutions that we

00:44:09.039 --> 00:44:09.049
those into any of the solutions that we
 

00:44:09.049 --> 00:44:11.499
those into any of the solutions that we
propose to any of these pressing

00:44:11.499 --> 00:44:11.509
propose to any of these pressing

problems so now we're going to make this

00:44:15.160 --> 00:44:15.170
problems so now we're going to make this
 

00:44:15.170 --> 00:44:18.099
problems so now we're going to make this
even more particular we started out with

can't do it alone we need to work
 

00:45:42.890 --> 00:45:45.520
can't do it alone we need to work
together we need to cooperate another

00:45:45.520 --> 00:45:45.530

thing I want to point that I want to

00:45:46.810 --> 00:45:46.820
thing I want to point that I want to
 

00:45:46.820 --> 00:45:49.120
thing I want to point that I want to
make is that we can't do everything and

00:45:49.120 --> 00:45:49.130
make is that we can't do everything and

this is a truism but politics is always

this is a truism but politics is always
the art of the possible and so you have

00:45:54.190 --> 00:45:54.200
the art of the possible and so you have
 

00:45:54.200 --> 00:45:56.230
the art of the possible and so you have
to set priorities and that means that

00:45:56.230 --> 00:45:56.240
to set priorities and that means that
 

00:45:56.240 --> 00:45:57.640
to set priorities and that means that
you can do some things and there are

00:45:57.640 --> 00:45:57.650
you can do some things and there are
 

00:45:57.650 --> 00:45:59.530
you can do some things and there are
other things that realistically you

00:45:59.530 --> 00:45:59.540
other things that realistically you
 

00:45:59.540 --> 00:46:02.530
other things that realistically you
can't do a third point I want to make is

00:46:02.530 --> 00:46:02.540
can't do a third point I want to make is
 

00:46:02.540 --> 00:46:04.300
can't do a third point I want to make is
and this is a very important point that

00:46:04.300 --> 00:46:04.310
and this is a very important point that
 

00:46:04.310 --> 00:46:06.120
and this is a very important point that
we often forget when we're talking about

00:46:06.120 --> 00:46:06.130
we often forget when we're talking about
 

00:46:06.130 --> 00:46:10.180

00:50:45.940 --> 00:50:48.870
say about Cuban the United States is
that people don't realize that the

of those G groupings that you've
 

00:52:02.079 --> 00:52:07.109
of those G groupings that you've
mentioned i think that the countries of

to provide solid varied models by which
 

00:52:18.789 --> 00:52:20.039
to provide solid varied models by which
the united states can engage

the united states can engage
 

00:52:20.049 --> 00:52:23.660
the united states can engage
economically with cuba which is probably

00:52:23.660 --> 00:52:23.670
economically with cuba which is probably
 

00:52:23.670 --> 00:52:27.390
economically with cuba which is probably
going to bring about greater change in

00:52:27.390 --> 00:52:27.400
going to bring about greater change in
 

00:52:27.400 --> 00:52:30.299
going to bring about greater change in
cuba than any of the policies that have

00:52:30.299 --> 00:52:30.309
cuba than any of the policies that have
 

00:52:30.309 --> 00:52:33.620
cuba than any of the policies that have
been followed thus far by our government

00:52:33.620 --> 00:52:33.630
been followed thus far by our government
 

00:52:33.630 --> 00:52:35.759
been followed thus far by our government
curiously though even though we've had a

an embargo an actual trading with the

an embargo an actual trading with the
 

00:52:39.309 --> 00:52:41.339
an embargo an actual trading with the
enemy act which has prohibited the

00:52:41.339 --> 00:52:41.349
enemy act which has prohibited the
 

00:52:41.349 --> 00:52:43.859

United States from officially doing

United States from officially doing
 

00:52:43.869 --> 00:52:45.630
United States from officially doing
business with Cuba it turns out that the

00:52:45.630 --> 00:52:45.640
business with Cuba it turns out that the
 

00:52:45.640 --> 00:52:47.189
business with Cuba it turns out that the
private sector in the United States has

00:52:47.189 --> 00:52:47.199
private sector in the United States has
 

00:52:47.199 --> 00:52:49.109
private sector in the United States has
that has been doing business with Cuba

00:52:49.109 --> 00:52:49.119
that has been doing business with Cuba
 

00:52:49.119 --> 00:52:52.469
that has been doing business with Cuba
and as we speak there are companies in

00:52:52.469 --> 00:52:52.479
and as we speak there are companies in
 

00:52:52.479 --> 00:52:55.979
and as we speak there are companies in
Pennsylvania and in Florida and in Idaho

Pennsylvania and in Florida and in Idaho
 

00:52:55.989 --> 00:52:57.539

that currently do business with Cuba

00:53:00.920 --> 00:53:00.930
that currently do business with Cuba
 

00:53:00.930 --> 00:53:04.170
that currently do business with Cuba
which i think is an enormous

00:53:04.170 --> 00:53:04.180
which i think is an enormous
 

00:53:04.180 --> 00:53:05.640
which i think is an enormous
contradiction given the fact that the

00:53:05.640 --> 00:53:05.650
contradiction given the fact that the
 

00:53:05.650 --> 00:53:07.109
contradiction given the fact that the
government still has an official policy

00:53:07.109 --> 00:53:07.119
government still has an official policy
 

00:53:07.119 --> 00:53:11.430
government still has an official policy
that prohibits that and the other thing

00:53:11.430 --> 00:53:11.440
that prohibits that and the other thing
 

00:53:11.440 --> 00:53:13.759
that prohibits that and the other thing
is to highlight the fact that actually

00:53:13.759 --> 00:53:13.769
is to highlight the fact that actually
 

00:53:13.769 --> 00:53:17.910
is to highlight the fact that actually
the policy that the United States has

00:53:17.910 --> 00:53:17.920
the policy that the United States has
 

00:53:17.920 --> 00:53:21.029
the policy that the United States has
maintained over the last 47 or 50 years

00:53:21.029 --> 00:53:21.039
maintained over the last 47 or 50 years
 

00:53:21.039 --> 00:53:23.430
maintained over the last 47 or 50 years
is something that was designed to

00:53:23.430 --> 00:53:23.440
is something that was designed to
 

00:53:23.440 --> 00:53:27.769
is something that was designed to
isolate a government a regime but the

00:53:27.769 --> 00:53:27.779
isolate a government a regime but the
 

00:53:27.779 --> 00:53:30.779
isolate a government a regime but the
lasting effects of that isolation have

00:53:30.779 --> 00:53:30.789
lasting effects of that isolation have
 

00:53:30.789 --> 00:53:32.670
lasting effects of that isolation have
affected the Cuban people much more than

00:53:32.670 --> 00:53:32.680
affected the Cuban people much more than
 

00:53:32.680 --> 00:53:34.920
affected the Cuban people much more than
it had has the Cuban state and I think

00:53:34.920 --> 00:53:34.930
it had has the Cuban state and I think
 

00:53:34.930 --> 00:53:39.359
it had has the Cuban state and I think
that this human sense of responsibility

00:53:39.359 --> 00:53:39.369
that this human sense of responsibility
 

00:53:39.369 --> 00:53:44.509
that this human sense of responsibility
is something that exact applicable here

00:53:44.509 --> 00:53:44.519
 

00:53:44.519 --> 00:53:47.609
it turns out that there's very little

00:53:47.609 --> 00:53:47.619
it turns out that there's very little
 

00:53:47.619 --> 00:53:49.079
it turns out that there's very little

United States might reap by engaging
with Cuba economically of course the

with Cuba economically of course the

usually are the politicians this is this

01:06:24.280 --> 01:06:24.290
usually are the politicians this is this
 

01:06:24.290 --> 01:06:27.280
usually are the politicians this is this
is it is true so I'm very hopeful I

01:06:27.280 --> 01:06:27.290
is it is true so I'm very hopeful I
 

01:06:27.290 --> 01:06:30.160
is it is true so I'm very hopeful I
would be surprised if this trend will

01:06:30.160 --> 01:06:30.170
would be surprised if this trend will
 

01:06:30.170 --> 01:06:32.400
would be surprised if this trend will
not continue and we will not see that

01:06:32.400 --> 01:06:32.410
not continue and we will not see that
 

01:06:32.410 --> 01:06:36.069
not continue and we will not see that

failure etc etc then I think if this is

01:07:09.220 --> 01:07:09.230
failure etc etc then I think if this is
 

01:07:09.230 --> 01:07:12.130

protectionism and I would wonder if
 

01:08:58.670 --> 01:09:03.849

understand that we don't have the
 

01:09:33.690 --> 01:09:35.870
understand that we don't have the
microphone anymore but I think it's a

01:09:35.870 --> 01:09:35.880
microphone anymore but I think it's a
 

01:09:35.880 --> 01:09:37.459
microphone anymore but I think it's a
small enough room that you can be heard

01:09:37.459 --> 01:09:37.469
small enough room that you can be heard

01:10:01.800 --> 01:10:07.410
George it's not that I think that the

01:10:07.410 --> 01:10:07.420
George it's not that I think that the
 

01:10:07.420 --> 01:10:09.330
George it's not that I think that the
problem itself as a psychological issue

01:10:09.330 --> 01:10:09.340
problem itself as a psychological issue
 

01:10:09.340 --> 01:10:12.419
problem itself as a psychological issue
I think the problem is very real but

01:10:12.419 --> 01:10:12.429
I think the problem is very real but
 

01:10:12.429 --> 01:10:14.120
I think the problem is very real but
there are a lot of psychological

01:10:14.120 --> 01:10:14.130
there are a lot of psychological
 

01:10:14.130 --> 01:10:16.950
there are a lot of psychological
impediments to dealing with the problem

01:10:16.950 --> 01:10:16.960
impediments to dealing with the problem
 

01:10:16.960 --> 01:10:22.470
impediments to dealing with the problem
the effects of anything the consequences

01:10:22.470 --> 01:10:22.480
the effects of anything the consequences
 

01:10:22.480 --> 01:10:25.290
the effects of anything the consequences
of global climate change are delayed and

01:10:25.290 --> 01:10:25.300
of global climate change are delayed and
 

01:10:25.300 --> 01:10:27.870
of global climate change are delayed and
we generally tend to not be very good at

01:10:27.870 --> 01:10:27.880
we generally tend to not be very good at
 

01:10:27.880 --> 01:10:29.640
we generally tend to not be very good at
dealing with problems that where the

01:10:29.640 --> 01:10:29.650
dealing with problems that where the
 

01:10:29.650 --> 01:10:33.090
dealing with problems that where the
costs are delayed and the where there

01:10:33.090 --> 01:10:33.100
costs are delayed and the where there
 

01:10:33.100 --> 01:10:35.400
costs are delayed and the where there
are media costs for delayed benefits or

01:10:35.400 --> 01:10:35.410
are media costs for delayed benefits or
 

01:10:35.410 --> 01:10:39.380
are media costs for delayed benefits or
the costs of failing to take action are

01:10:39.380 --> 01:10:39.390
the costs of failing to take action are
 

01:10:39.390 --> 01:10:44.330
the costs of failing to take action are
delayed the as i said the impact of any

01:10:44.330 --> 01:10:44.340
delayed the as i said the impact of any
 

01:10:44.340 --> 01:10:46.470
delayed the as i said the impact of any
behavior that we do is likely to be

01:10:46.470 --> 01:10:46.480
behavior that we do is likely to be
 

01:10:46.480 --> 01:10:48.540
behavior that we do is likely to be
minimal that's the that's the drop in

01:10:48.540 --> 01:10:48.550
minimal that's the that's the drop in
 

01:10:48.550 --> 01:10:53.580
minimal that's the that's the drop in
the bucket effect so there's there's a

01:10:53.580 --> 01:10:53.590
the bucket effect so there's there's a
 

01:10:53.590 --> 01:10:58.830
the bucket effect so there's there's a
lot of psychological reasons why we

01:10:58.830 --> 01:10:58.840
lot of psychological reasons why we
 

01:10:58.840 --> 01:11:00.660
lot of psychological reasons why we
can't why this problem is so difficult

01:11:00.660 --> 01:11:00.670
can't why this problem is so difficult
 

01:11:00.670 --> 01:11:03.439
can't why this problem is so difficult
to solve I personally think that the

01:11:03.439 --> 01:11:03.449
to solve I personally think that the
 

01:11:03.449 --> 01:11:06.689
to solve I personally think that the
self-serving bias may be the number one

01:11:06.689 --> 01:11:06.699
self-serving bias may be the number one
 

01:11:06.699 --> 01:11:08.640
self-serving bias may be the number one
reason but there there are a lot of

01:11:08.640 --> 01:11:08.650
reason but there there are a lot of
 

01:11:08.650 --> 01:11:13.439
reason but there there are a lot of
other reasons and that was the that was

01:11:13.439 --> 01:11:13.449
other reasons and that was the that was
 

01:11:13.449 --> 01:11:15.300
other reasons and that was the that was
the point I was making so we need to if

01:11:15.300 --> 01:11:15.310
the point I was making so we need to if
 

01:11:15.310 --> 01:11:18.090
the point I was making so we need to if
we if we want to try to think of

01:11:18.090 --> 01:11:18.100
we if we want to try to think of
 

01:11:18.100 --> 01:11:20.220
we if we want to try to think of
solutions to the problem we need to take

01:11:20.220 --> 01:11:20.230
solutions to the problem we need to take
 

01:11:20.230 --> 01:11:22.590
solutions to the problem we need to take
into account the same psychology which

01:11:22.590 --> 01:11:22.600
into account the same psychology which
 

01:11:22.600 --> 01:11:27.110
into account the same psychology which
is contributing to the problem itself

01:11:27.110 --> 01:11:27.120
is contributing to the problem itself
 

01:11:27.120 --> 01:11:32.470
is contributing to the problem itself
