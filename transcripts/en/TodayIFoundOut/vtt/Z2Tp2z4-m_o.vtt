00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:10.480
Anyone retiring from the coal-mines of life,
might have noticed an ever growing defacement.

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:12.010
Their noses and ears appear to be bigger.

00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:13.010
In fact, they are.

00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:15.769
There is a common misconception this growth
is due to cartilage continuing to grow as

00:00:15.769 --> 00:00:16.769
you age.

00:00:16.769 --> 00:00:17.769
In reality, this isn’t true.

00:00:17.769 --> 00:00:18.769
The real reason our noses and ears keep growing
is the result of that red-headed-stepchild

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:19.769
of fundamental forces, gravity.

00:00:19.769 --> 00:00:23.810
To understand why our facial protrusions begin
to make us look like Pinocchio caught red-handed,

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:31.150
let’s break apart what cartilage actually
is, how it grows, and why it sags over time.

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:36.530
Cartilage is connective tissue coming in three
forms: Hyaline, Elastic, and Fibrocartilage.

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:41.460
The three main components of all cartilage
types are: cells called chondrocytes, elastin

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:44.410
fibers, and an intercellular matrix material.

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:48.470
The difference between the three types lies
in the kinds of protein fiber and their amounts

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:50.390
embedded within the matrix.

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:55.500
Hyaline cartilage (also called articular)
contains large protein molecules, like collagen,

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:56.820
making up its matrix.

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:00.070
This matrix is the predominant material within
hyaline cartilage.

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:04.400
It’s the most common throughout the body,
found in your joints and on the edge of your

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:05.400
ribs.

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:09.920
This is also the type responsible for the
shape of your sizable sniffer.

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:15.670
Elastic cartilage has large amounts of the
same matrix material as hyaline, but its main

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:18.530
component is elastic fibers that give it more
flexibility.

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:21.119
This type of cartilage is responsible for
your ears.

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:25.579
It’s also found in your epiglottis (the
flap that keeps your food and drink from going

00:01:25.579 --> 00:01:32.259
down your lungs), and in the tubes between
your ears and mouth, called Eustachian tubes.

00:01:32.259 --> 00:01:36.319
spine1Fibrocartilage is exactly what the name
implies, mostly fibers.

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:42.030
Unlike hyaline cartilage’s uniform structure,
the fibers in this type of cartilage are more

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:44.799
open and have a spongy-like architecture.

00:01:44.799 --> 00:01:46.689
This makes them perfect for shock absorption.

00:01:46.689 --> 00:01:52.189
As such, you can find them between your vertebrae,
and in the joints of your knee, shoulders,

00:01:52.189 --> 00:01:53.189
and mandible.

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:59.119
All types of cartilage grow in one of two
ways; interstitial, and appositional.

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:04.490
Interstitial growth happens when cartilage
is formed by chondrocytes within the cartilage,

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:07.009
forming additional matrix.

00:02:07.009 --> 00:02:10.179
Appositional growth happens by adding new
cartilage on the surface.

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:15.069
This is formed from chondrocytes in a dense
layer of connective tissue surrounding the

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:17.200
cartilage, called the perichondrium.

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:21.709
The question then becomes: does this interstitial
and appositional growth, cause the mass of

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:24.819
our cartilage, and its size, to increase as
we age?

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:27.540
The result being bigger ears and noses.

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:28.540
The answer is no.

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:29.540
Studies have shown the numbers of cells present
in our cartilage is very similar up to the

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:30.540
age of 40.

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:31.540
After that, we actually have a significantly
lower number of cells present here- specifically,

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:32.540
1.8 times lower.

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:33.540
The misconception that cartilage continues
to grow in size throughout our lifetime is

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:34.540
mainly attributed to the growth in sharks.

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:35.540
Sharks skeletal structure is mostly cartilage
and they do continue growing throughout their

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:36.540
lives.

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:37.540
Fortunately for us, this doesn’t happen
in humans.

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:38.540
old-manAs mentioned before, the actual cause
of our seemingly-swelling snout is gravity.

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:40.320
When we age, the collagen and elastin fibers
that make up cartilage begin to break down.

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:44.290
This causes them to stretch and sag, making
them appear longer.

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:49.180
Our skin giving structural support to cartilage
also contains collagen and elastin fibers

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:50.810
that droop over time.

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:53.340
This compounds the lengthening problem.

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:58.000
Drooping isn’t the only cause to the appearance
of larger ears and noses.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:02.430
The surrounding areas of the face, like your
cheeks and lips, lose volume over time.

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:05.441
The result is the appearance of larger organs
next to them.

00:03:05.441 --> 00:03:06.441
Similar to the time honored tradition of standing
next to someone who looks worse then you when

00:03:06.441 --> 00:03:07.441
trying to hit on a prospective mate.

00:03:07.441 --> 00:03:08.441
It makes you look better!

00:03:08.441 --> 00:03:10.930
All of this drooping and stretching does cause
our ears and noses to lengthen.

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:15.849
Studies have shown that ears elongate by .22
millimeters per year.

00:03:15.849 --> 00:03:21.510
This elongation-to-age ratio is so exacting,
it can be used by forensic scientists to determine

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:39.780
the approximate age of a person.
