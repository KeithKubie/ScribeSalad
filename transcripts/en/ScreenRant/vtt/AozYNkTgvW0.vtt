00:00:07.959 --> 00:00:11.700
When you stop and think about it, it’s a
little shocking to realize just how much impact

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:16.490
Disney has over the world’s youngest generations,
aiming animated films squarely at kids when

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:17.849
they’re at their most impressionable.

00:00:17.849 --> 00:00:19.460
But there’s no reason to worry, right?

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:23.640
Disney movies tell stories in which the heroes
beat the villains, good triumphs over evil,

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:27.710
people accept their differences, and live
happily ever after… but those aren’t always

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:29.099
the lessons being taught.

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:32.270
And when you take a closer look, you have
to wonder if we’re sending our kids the

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:33.800
best possible messages.

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:37.800
That’s exactly what we’re doing in our
latest docu video: Why Kids Should NEVER Watch

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.370
Disney Movies.

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:43.309
Don’t Listen to Your Parents

00:00:43.309 --> 00:00:44.309
The Lion King
The Little Mermaid

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:45.309
Finding Nemo

00:00:45.309 --> 00:00:48.270
When you’re a kid, your parents are responsible
for most of the worst parts of life: eating

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:51.570
vegetables, getting grounded, and basically
telling you what NOT to do.

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:56.350
So is it any coincidence that most Disney
movies begin the same way, with boring, angry

00:00:56.350 --> 00:01:01.300
or just worrying parents insisting the heroes
NOT go on an adventure, and just stay home,

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:02.300
away from excitement?

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:06.670
Kids soon learn that if they want real adventure,
new friends, or the life they truly deserve,

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:10.460
it all starts by completely ignoring your
parents advice or rules.

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:14.729
It’s actually staggering when you realize
how many Disney movies rely on this same twist

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:17.130
– assuming the hero has any parents left
alive.

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:21.850
Sure, going places your parents say are dangerous,
getting friendly with people they see as villains,

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:25.881
or actively putting yourself in danger all
works out in a Disney movie, but not in the

00:01:25.881 --> 00:01:26.881
real world.

00:01:26.881 --> 00:01:30.750
In the real world, getting kidnapped like
Nemo, cursed like the Little Mermaid, or heading

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:35.160
to the one place your king father told you
not to like Simba is a lesson you shouldn’t

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:36.160
have to learn.

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:39.810
It gets weirder when you realize how boys
and girls are treated differently by Disney.

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:45.560
While Disney princesses deal with overbearing
parents (Jasmine, Brave, Little Mermaid, Frozen),

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:49.680
the decision to ignore their advice usually
leads to tragedy – leaving them in need

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:50.840
of being rescued.

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:56.250
For the boys (Nemo, Prince Philip in Little
Mermaid, Simba, Tarzan), disobeying parents

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:57.250
leads to adventure.

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:01.470
It may be a rough one, but it makes them the
heroes they were meant to be, and you can’t

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:05.610
save the day – or the girl – unless you
ruin everything first!

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:07.189
Assume The Best of Absolutely Everyone

00:02:07.189 --> 00:02:08.189
Beauty and the Beast
The Little Mermaid

00:02:08.189 --> 00:02:09.189
Aladdin
The Lion King

00:02:09.189 --> 00:02:10.189
Tarzan
Snow White

00:02:10.189 --> 00:02:11.189
Teaching kids that listening to your legal
guardians means nothing but a boring life

00:02:11.189 --> 00:02:15.090
is bad enough, but what about the strangers,
criminals, or villains they might encounter

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:16.160
along the way?

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:20.650
Disney has more solid advice: no matter how
evil, deceitful, or dangerous a person might

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:24.500
appear, always – always – assume they’re
your friend.

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:28.010
Parents and teachers might educate kids on
“stranger danger” but Disney does the

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:29.010
opposite.

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:30.340
An old woman offers you food?

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:31.920
It’s rude NOT to eat it (Snow White).

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:36.060
Your father’s older, clearly evil and creepy
friend getting a little too close?

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:37.790
An insult or two is all you need.

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:41.260
Your uncle clearly wants you and your father
dead, and doesn’t even hide it anymore?

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:42.400
Laugh it off!

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:46.100
And if all your dreams are promised to come
true by a witch or wizard who might as well

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:50.090
be wearing a t-shirt that says “DON’T
TRUST ME”, magic is magic (Little Mermaid).

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:53.770
Also, it’s unfair to assume people will
succumb to their old habits or worst qualities

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:56.590
when given the perfect opportunity to let
them loose (Clayton in Tarzan).

00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:00.430
Making the villains look evil from the start
may clue kids in on the story, but when they

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:04.200
enter the world thinking every person who
wants to hurt, trick, or take advantage of

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:09.000
will literally look completely evil, how can
you expect them NOT to get fooled?

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:10.911
All Love is True Love If You’re Beautiful

00:03:10.911 --> 00:03:11.911
Cinderella
Sleeping Beauty

00:03:11.911 --> 00:03:12.911
The Little Mermaid
Aladdin

00:03:12.911 --> 00:03:13.911
Tarzan
Frozen

00:03:13.911 --> 00:03:14.911
Tangled
The Princess and the Frog

00:03:14.911 --> 00:03:15.911
The Hunchback of Notre Dame

00:03:15.911 --> 00:03:16.911
It’s what makes sure good wins over evil,
breaking curses, and turning even the hardest

00:03:16.911 --> 00:03:17.911
of hearts pure again: true love.

00:03:17.911 --> 00:03:22.540
Or, in Disney movies, basically anytime two
beautiful people meet – especially if one

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:24.370
needs to be rescued by the end of the story.

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:28.490
You could argue that Disney is bound to draw
people who are nice to look at, since nobody

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:32.780
would ever want to see even the most heroic
and good-hearted characters find love if they’re

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:35.330
truly, truly ugly (sorry, Quasi – from Hunchback).

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:38.930
But honestly, Disney’s classics don’t
even bother letting their princes and princesses

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:43.190
get to know eachother before assuming that
when two gorgeous people meet, that instant

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:47.440
attraction, and longing to spend more time
together in private… that’s as true as

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:48.440
love gets.

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:50.270
Honestly, you don’t even need to be awake
for it!

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:51.270
(Sleeping Beauty kiss)

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:55.050
Thankfully, modern writers and directors realized
how messed up this idea really was.

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:59.450
Movies like Tangled and the Princess and the
Frog saw true love grow from immediate hate,

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:03.660
but still, even the Frog Prince or the Beast
are revealed to be incredibly handsome, and

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:05.620
therefore deserving of that love in the end.

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:08.200
The abusive insults was all just emotional
armor!

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:12.000
Frozen even played on this classic Disney
trope, since Anna falls in love with the first

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.770
man she meets – and it was all part of his
evil plan.

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:18.470
Thankfully, she DOES fall in love by the end
of the movie, meaning THIS (Kristoff from

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:22.030
Frozen) is about as ugly a man as a Disney
princess is allowed to fall for.

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:24.949
And only when the alternative is literally
trying to murder you.

00:04:24.949 --> 00:04:26.650
It’s Good to Be Different…

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:27.650
Eventually

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:28.650
Wreck-it Ralph
Brave

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:29.650
Frozen
The Incredibles

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:30.650
Finding Nemo
Dumbo

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:31.650
Monsters, Inc.

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:32.650
It’s impossible to count how many Disney
movies begin the same way: with a hero or

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:35.560
heroine who is a little bit different, getting
them teased until they reach their true potential,

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:37.969
and show that being different is what makes
them special.

00:04:37.969 --> 00:04:42.169
A great message until you realize that Disney
is basically claiming that our differences

00:04:42.169 --> 00:04:46.800
should be, could be, or simply ARE ridiculed,
no matter the difference.

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:50.740
Sure, everyone gets along in the end, but
only after the person with the deformity (Finding

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:53.199
Nemo, Dumbo), less-than-desirable role as
the bad guy (Wreck-it Ralph, Sully from Monsters,

00:04:53.199 --> 00:04:57.080
Inc.), or just a free spirit (Brave) proves
that they are actually exceptional, and their

00:04:57.080 --> 00:04:58.650
problem is really a gift.

00:04:58.650 --> 00:04:59.669
But what if it ISN’T?

00:04:59.669 --> 00:05:03.289
For starters, we would argue that Disney movies
showing young characters who aren’t being

00:05:03.289 --> 00:05:07.540
tormented or ostracized by parents or friends
for their differences would probably be a

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:09.270
better message for kids to receive.

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:13.220
Frozen is the biggest movie from Disney in
years, and it told kids that even if they

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:17.620
are literally magical witches or wizards,
they should probably hide that, because everyone

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:20.169
will be terrified of you showing what makes
you special.

00:05:20.169 --> 00:05:24.439
And yes, the movie ends with Elsa’s powers
accepted, and the sisters reconnecting – but

00:05:24.439 --> 00:05:28.349
only after they were almost murdered., and
everyone agreeing to be cool with ice powers

00:05:28.349 --> 00:05:29.990
if they got winter in July.

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:33.770
What if the villain’s plan DIDN’T require
Elsa be killed, and just let her be run out

00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:34.770
of her kingdom?

00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:37.159
And what if Dumbo’s giant ears DIDN’T
allow him to fly?

00:05:37.159 --> 00:05:39.030
Would nobody have actually gotten past it?

00:05:39.030 --> 00:05:41.729
If only Quasimoto’s hunchback granted wishes.

00:05:41.729 --> 00:05:45.569
In the end, it might be the biggest lesson
Disney movies teach to kids: the things that

00:05:45.569 --> 00:05:47.960
make you different will cause most people
to hate you.

00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:50.229
But only until they see it’s what makes
you special.

00:05:50.229 --> 00:05:53.439
Like, actually special, like have a superpower.

00:05:53.439 --> 00:05:54.439
Otherwise….

00:05:54.439 --> 00:05:55.439
We hope you like gargoyles (last Quasimoto
shot, I swear).

00:05:55.439 --> 00:05:56.439
So what do you think?

00:05:56.439 --> 00:06:00.319
Are the lessons taught by Disney movies more
complicated, or more messed up than they usually

00:06:00.319 --> 00:06:01.319
claim?

00:06:01.319 --> 00:06:03.039
Are there any other prime examples we’re
missing?

00:06:03.039 --> 00:06:06.770
There’s no right answer, but it’s hard
to ignore that the kind of ‘adult’ messages

00:06:06.770 --> 00:06:10.729
or tone Disney is tackling require closer
attention than they’re being given.
