00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:06.220
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, DC.

00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:08.920
&gt;&gt; Barrie Hardymon: Welcome
to the National Book Festival.

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:10.240
I'm Barrie Hardymon.

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:12.800
I'm a books editor at NPR,
which is a media partner

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:14.350
of this fine festival.

00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:17.960
I need to thank the co-chairman
of the festival, David Rubinstein,

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:20.820
and all the other sponsors who
have made this event possible

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:24.230
and continue to support
it year after year.

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:27.510
One more piece of business, cell
phones off or airplane mode.

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:29.210
I'm okay with airplane mode too.

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:31.260
Okay. Okay.

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:32.560
Down to business.

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:34.720
I'm so excited to talk
to Charlie Jane Anders.

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:37.260
She's the author of one of my
favorite books of the year.

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:38.930
It came out in January.

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:42.000
It is a one-sitting book, but
it is the kind, but you'll want

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.520
to stretch it out to five sittings.

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:45.980
It's called All the
Birds in the Sky.

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:49.070
Here, I happen to have
one right here.

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:52.130
She was a founding editor
of the website, IO9.

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:54.120
She's won a Hugo award
among other honors.

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.580
She's written all kinds of
other things that you can find

00:00:56.580 --> 00:00:58.360
in collections and on the web.

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:00.910
I encourage you to Google here.

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:02.210
Hi.

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:03.510
&gt;&gt; Charlie Jane Anders: Hi.

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:04.810
It's so good to be here.

00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:06.110
&gt;&gt; Barrie Hardymon: So
can we start with the book

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:07.650
because I'm so, I loved it so much.

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:08.950
&gt;&gt; Charlie Jane Anders: Yeah.

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:10.590 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Barrie Hardymon: And I don't know
if our audience is familiar with it,

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:12.110
but just, let's give
them a little sense of it

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:13.860
because I have the feeling
when I was reading it

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:16.650
that the author's whole
self was in it.

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:17.950
&gt;&gt; Charlie Jane Anders: Oh my gosh.

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:19.250
&gt;&gt; Barrie Hardymon: So I
think that will be a good way

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:20.550
to introduce them to you.

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:22.900
So let's sketch it
out for our audience.

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:25.380
The first act is like
a miso [phonetic],

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:29.160
called life for witches kind of
thing, like it's, it's too geeky,

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:34.510
junior high, outcast name,
Patricia and Lawrence, briefly,

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:36.990
they are a witch and
a mad scientist.

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:38.730
Can you just tell us a
little bit about them?

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:42.860
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I mean basically I wanted
to tell a coming of age story

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:46.180
which then includes what
happens after coming of age,

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:50.770 position:56%
so the first like hundred pages of
the book is these characters as kids

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:54.700
in junior high school, and,
you know, everybody always says

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:56.620
that high school is
hell, but I really think

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:58.100
that junior high school is hell.

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:59.400
&gt;&gt; Barrie Hardymon: I agree.

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:00.700 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Charlie Jane Anders: Like I think

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:02.320
that when you have all these crazy
hormones and you're like dealing

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:07.760 position:56%
with gleeks and bullies, and I think
it's just at its absolute worst

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:10.310
in like seventh and eighth grade.

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:13.000
That's when it's just
like the most horrific.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.560 position:56%
And so they're dealing with all this
stuff and they're also just trying

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:18.950
to figure out who they
are as like, you know,

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:23.840
someone who can do a little bit
of magic and occasionally talk

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:28.020
to animals and then someone else
who can build really weird gadgets

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:32.590
but doesn't have a lot of control
over, you know, his abilities

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:35.590 position:56%
yet either, and so it's kind of like
trying to figure out who you are

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:37.460
and where you belong kind of stuff.

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:39.100
&gt;&gt; Barrie Hardymon: And I
love that their magic is

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:40.530
like sort of a bummer at first.

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:42.700
Like it's kind of like,
it's real junior high magic.

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:45.700
Like he makes a time machine that
like a two-second time machine.

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:47.000
&gt;&gt; Charlie Jane Anders: Right.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:48.300
Right, right.

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:49.600
&gt;&gt; Barrie Hardymon: And so there's
such a, it's such a cheeky sort

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:52.090
of look at how when you're in
junior high school everything feels

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:53.540
like a bummer, even your magical.

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:55.450
You don't know what your magic is.

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:56.750
&gt;&gt; Charlie Jane Anders:
Right, right.

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:58.050
&gt;&gt; Barrie Hardymon: You
know, because you have to get

00:02:58.050 --> 00:02:59.910
out of junior high and high school
and sometimes the first year

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:01.210
of college [laughter] but--

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:02.510
&gt;&gt; Charlie Jane Anders: Oh my God.

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:03.810
&gt;&gt; Barrie Hardymon: So
then we jump ahead of it.

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:05.110
&gt;&gt; Charlie Jane Anders: Yeah.

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:06.410
&gt;&gt; Barrie Hardymon: And because
they have to grow up to find

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:09.050
out that all the things that made
them different actually makes them

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:10.350
really awesome.

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:13.620
So they each go to school,
and when they reunite we are

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:17.140
in a precarious environment.

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:18.440
&gt;&gt; Charlie Jane Anders: Yeah.

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:19.740
&gt;&gt; Barrie Hardymon: So
what's the state of the world

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:21.100
when Patricia and Lawrence meet up?

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:22.400
&gt;&gt; Charlie Jane Anders: Yeah,
I mean it's interesting.

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:26.920
Like the second like half or maybe
two-thirds of the book takes place

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:31.110
in the near future in San
Francisco, and it's, you know,

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:33.380
the world is kind of
falling apart a little bit.

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:37.360
It's not like, you know, some
kind of crazy doomsday scenario.

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:40.920
It's more just like a bunch of
things that are already going on,

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:43.170
have just gotten kind of worse,

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:46.720
like there's antibiotic-resistant
diseases and there's

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:50.390
like some problems with
drought and flooding

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:52.890
and just environmental
issues, and it's just--

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:55.540
things have gotten a little
bit harder in general.

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:57.890
And so I mean, you know, somebody,

00:03:57.890 --> 00:04:00.550
earlier today I was being
interviewed for another thing,

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:02.460
and they used the D word.

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:04.870
Dystopia. And I was like, no,
no, no, don't use the D word.

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:06.490
&gt;&gt; Barrie Hardymon: Oh, I
was just about to use it.

00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:07.790
&gt;&gt; Charlie Jane Anders: Oh, no.

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:09.090
Sorry.

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:10.390
&gt;&gt; Barrie Hardymon:
No, I'm just kidding.

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:11.690
&gt;&gt; Charlie Jane Anders:
And I was like, you know,

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:12.990
because everybody was like kind of
sick of dystopias right now thanks

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:14.800
to like, you know, the kind of
post-Hunger Games feeding frenzy.

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:16.100
&gt;&gt; Barrie Hardymon: Yeah,
the actual dystopia.

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:17.400
&gt;&gt; Charlie Jane Anders: Yeah.

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:18.700
Well there's also that.

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:21.320
But, you know, but it's also just,
I didn't think of it as a dystopia.

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:25.920
I thought of it as our world just a
little bit worse, and it gets worse

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:29.620
as the book goes on because of some
things that happen, but I wanted it

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:32.470
to be-- I didn't want it to be like
we're fighting the evil empire.

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:35.080
I wanted it to be like we're
just dealing with life,

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:38.070
and life can be really tough
sometimes, and I also thought

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:40.630
that that was a way to get at
some of these ideas of like,

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:44.870
you have a mad scientist and a
witch, so it's about like science

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:47.780
and nature, and thinking
about environmental problems

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:50.800
in particular is one of the ways
that we have to kind of think

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:53.980
about like nature and technology
and how they go together.

00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:57.320
So that was kind of a thing that
I wanted to kind of slowly bring

00:04:57.320 --> 00:05:00.660
to the present, bring to the
fore in the book without ever

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:02.600
like bludgeoning the
reader hopefully.

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:05.770
&gt;&gt; Barrie Hardymon: I love the--
one of the things that's so nice is

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:09.740
that that, that thing, the science
versus magic, which is at the heart

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:13.060
of this book, you know,
could have been a thing

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:17.160
where magic is the naturey,
you know, and the evil text,

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:20.820
but you're so, you clearly
love all of these things,

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:22.210
which, you know, we all should.

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:25.270
I want-- one particular item
that I really love in the future

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:27.470
and I'm really looking
forward to is the caddy.

00:05:27.470 --> 00:05:28.770
&gt;&gt; Charlie Jane Anders:
Oh [laughter].

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:30.070
&gt;&gt; Barrie Hardymon: Which
is this iPod-like tablet.

00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:34.320 position:56%
I shouldn't say it, but it's a
tablet which makes your life better.

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:37.490
It will steer you toward
your people you'll like.

00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:39.210
You can catch a bus more easily.

00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:40.510
You'll avoid [inaudible].

00:05:40.510 --> 00:05:42.240
It's like a serendipity machine.

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:43.540
&gt;&gt; Charlie Jane Anders: Right.

00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:44.840
&gt;&gt; Barrie Hardymon: And it kind
of may be what, like which is just

00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:49.620
such a lovely way to look at a
technology, you know, the phone,

00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:51.500
that is in my pocket right now.

00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:52.800
&gt;&gt; Charlie Jane Anders: Right.

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:54.430
&gt;&gt; Barrie Hardymon: And I still--
and like I touched it, and,

00:05:54.430 --> 00:05:57.250
you know, we're all sort of,
you know, obsessed with it.

00:05:57.250 --> 00:05:58.550
&gt;&gt; Right. Right.

00:05:58.550 --> 00:06:01.080 position:56%
&gt;&gt; It was such a-- you still have a
real fondness for technology as much

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:04.570
as magic, and I just-- like what's
your relationship to your phone

00:06:04.570 --> 00:06:08.650
that you could create a
beautiful object like the caddy.

00:06:08.650 --> 00:06:10.230
Like is this a hopeful vision of--

00:06:10.230 --> 00:06:12.310
&gt;&gt; Charlie Jane Anders: I mean
I think it's a hopeful vision.

00:06:12.310 --> 00:06:15.740
And like actually it was
funny because I was worried

00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:17.850
that by the time the book
came out there was like a long

00:06:17.850 --> 00:06:21.370
like two-year lead time from them
buying it to it getting published.

00:06:21.370 --> 00:06:23.500
I was worried that the caddy
was already going to exist

00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:24.800
by the time the book came out.

00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:27.000
Like, I was like someone's going
to actually invent this thing,

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:30.810
and then it's going to be like,
oh, you know, but I don't know.

00:06:30.810 --> 00:06:35.970 position:56%
I mean I wanted to like, you know, I
didn't, like I think my early ideas

00:06:35.970 --> 00:06:37.920
of the book were like all
the science was just going

00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:42.370
to be way out, like ray guns
and space ships and, you know,

00:06:42.370 --> 00:06:46.660
giant robots and stuff, and then
I was like I guess I got more

00:06:46.660 --> 00:06:50.070
into thinking about like how
technology actually changing our

00:06:50.070 --> 00:06:53.120
lives and how it actually
is kind of a real thing

00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:56.230
and like how our gadgets have
kind of made everything different

00:06:56.230 --> 00:06:59.460
and kind of just thinking about
like what if that was even better

00:06:59.460 --> 00:07:01.320
or more, you know, more real.

00:07:01.320 --> 00:07:02.740
&gt;&gt; Barrie Hardymon:
And more empathetic.

00:07:02.740 --> 00:07:04.890
&gt;&gt; Charlie Jane Anders: You know,
in general, I wanted to avoid,

00:07:04.890 --> 00:07:08.360
like you mentioned about the sort
of witch, the naturey kind of,

00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:12.760
you know, earth mother
kind of thing, I wanted to,

00:07:12.760 --> 00:07:14.140 position:56%
I mean that's in there a little bit,

00:07:14.140 --> 00:07:16.440
but I wanted to avoid
playing to the stereotypes

00:07:16.440 --> 00:07:17.740
&gt;&gt; Barrie Hardymon: You avoid it.

00:07:17.740 --> 00:07:19.040
&gt;&gt; Charlie Jane Anders: And
I wanted to be like okay,

00:07:19.040 --> 00:07:21.040
one of the first things we find
out about when we meet some

00:07:21.040 --> 00:07:24.190
of the other witches is that one
of them loves microwave ovens,

00:07:24.190 --> 00:07:28.610
just like loves microwave ovens,
and like he just will go on about

00:07:28.610 --> 00:07:30.530
like my life has been
changed by the microwave,

00:07:30.530 --> 00:07:33.370
like I can't believe I can just
put things in it and then it's hot

00:07:33.370 --> 00:07:37.400
and it's awesome, and like, you
know, and like, I don't know,

00:07:37.400 --> 00:07:40.010
I lived in a Buddhist
nunnery when I was a teenager,

00:07:40.010 --> 00:07:43.540
and all the nuns had cell phones
and like they were all like riding

00:07:43.540 --> 00:07:46.840
around on little motorcycle
scooters, and like they were not

00:07:46.840 --> 00:07:48.970
like avoiding technology at all.

00:07:48.970 --> 00:07:52.020
It's lovely that you've made this,
I'm not going to say dystopia,

00:07:52.020 --> 00:07:56.160
but you've made this near future
that has turned, you know, 11.

00:07:56.160 --> 00:07:57.460
&gt;&gt; Charlie Jane Anders: Right.

00:07:57.460 --> 00:07:58.760
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:07:58.760 --> 00:08:00.060
&gt;&gt; Barrie Hardymon: You've
made it really relatable

00:08:00.060 --> 00:08:01.690
and very, very, it's very funny.

00:08:01.690 --> 00:08:09.510
I think there's something, I just
wonder, what's so funny about the,

00:08:09.510 --> 00:08:13.810 position:56%
there's something about, well how do
you find that humor as the world is

00:08:13.810 --> 00:08:17.060
in really dire straits in
all of these ways that,

00:08:17.060 --> 00:08:18.960
you know, I could see happening.

00:08:18.960 --> 00:08:22.610
I mean there is a path to
this world that you lay out.

00:08:22.610 --> 00:08:23.920
&gt;&gt; Charlie Jane Anders: Yeah,
I mean it's interesting.

00:08:23.920 --> 00:08:26.040
The thing about the humor,
like you mentioned humor

00:08:26.040 --> 00:08:29.330
and also relatability, that
like, you know, you can relate

00:08:29.330 --> 00:08:30.930 position:56%
to the characters and it feels real.

00:08:30.930 --> 00:08:33.020
That was actually something
that I struggled with a lot

00:08:33.020 --> 00:08:36.550
in writing this book, and there
was a draft it like, you know,

00:08:36.550 --> 00:08:39.580
fairly late in the process that
was a lot funnier and more kind

00:08:39.580 --> 00:08:43.380
of like satirical and, you
know, more slap sticky.

00:08:43.380 --> 00:08:47.280
There was more just kind of like
zany mishaps, and what I found was

00:08:47.280 --> 00:08:51.990
like the humor in this
particular book only seemed to work

00:08:51.990 --> 00:08:55.150
if it was very close to the
characters and if it was

00:08:55.150 --> 00:08:58.800
like the characters actually kind
of laughing at their situation

00:08:58.800 --> 00:09:01.550
or if it was something that was
sympathetic to the characters even

00:09:01.550 --> 00:09:03.940
when we're kind of making
fun of them a little bit.

00:09:03.940 --> 00:09:07.730
And I found that like, you
know, humor can kind of,

00:09:07.730 --> 00:09:11.240
like I love absurdism, and I
love that there's kind of an,

00:09:11.240 --> 00:09:14.560
there's some absurd elements
to this kind of weird future,

00:09:14.560 --> 00:09:18.060
but at the same time I just wanted
to, you know, it's very easy

00:09:18.060 --> 00:09:20.690
to get sidetracked
to laughing at it,

00:09:20.690 --> 00:09:23.710
and I wanted to keep it very
close to the emotion and the core

00:09:23.710 --> 00:09:25.890
of what they're, what they're
feeling, and how they're,

00:09:25.890 --> 00:09:28.730
and the relationship between
the two main characters.

00:09:28.730 --> 00:09:32.120
And so I actually kept dialing
back the humor in the book and kind

00:09:32.120 --> 00:09:36.360
of making it, consciously making it
a little bit less funny and going

00:09:36.360 --> 00:09:40.330
for kind of whimsical rather
than just kind of like up like,

00:09:40.330 --> 00:09:43.070
you know, actual comedy I guess.

00:09:43.070 --> 00:09:45.420
&gt;&gt; Barrie Hardymon: Yeah, and
it is, I mean it does have that,

00:09:45.420 --> 00:09:47.880
I mean it is at its heart,
it's a love story, as you say.

00:09:47.880 --> 00:09:50.300
It's really the story
of Patricia and Lawrence

00:09:50.300 --> 00:09:56.170
and I think how they are
discovering how they affect others,

00:09:56.170 --> 00:10:00.040
and they have these other powers
that are, you know, beyond us.

00:10:00.040 --> 00:10:05.250
I wonder, when you think about, the
way that these two characters act

00:10:05.250 --> 00:10:09.430
in a story is very much the way any
two characters acting would fall

00:10:09.430 --> 00:10:10.730
in love.

00:10:10.730 --> 00:10:12.030
&gt;&gt; Charlie Jane Anders: Oh yeah.

00:10:12.030 --> 00:10:13.330
&gt;&gt; Barrie Hardymon: In any world.

00:10:13.330 --> 00:10:14.630
So I guess I wanted to ask you,
because this is one of these books.

00:10:14.630 --> 00:10:16.980
When I recommend it to
people I can pick any genre

00:10:16.980 --> 00:10:19.440
and say it's this,
it's this, it's this.

00:10:19.440 --> 00:10:20.740
There's so much in it.

00:10:20.740 --> 00:10:22.040
&gt;&gt; Charlie Jane Anders:
Awesome, hey, that's awesome.

00:10:22.040 --> 00:10:24.660
&gt;&gt; Barrie Hardymon: But what does
genre mean for you when you're,

00:10:24.660 --> 00:10:27.240
when you're making these characters
and placing them in a world,

00:10:27.240 --> 00:10:29.780
as a writer, like what
is making that world?

00:10:29.780 --> 00:10:31.080
&gt;&gt; Charlie Jane Anders:
I mean, you know, it's--

00:10:31.080 --> 00:10:32.660
I feel like writing this book

00:10:32.660 --> 00:10:35.100
in particular really changed
how I think about genre.

00:10:35.100 --> 00:10:38.980
Like I thought of it originally
as like the meeting of two genres

00:10:38.980 --> 00:10:41.640
and like you have fantasy
and you have science fiction,

00:10:41.640 --> 00:10:44.870 position:56%
and they have different expectations
of what's going to happen

00:10:44.870 --> 00:10:49.140
in the story and different
ideas about how the world works,

00:10:49.140 --> 00:10:52.550
and I found that meeting really
interesting and like, you know,

00:10:52.550 --> 00:10:53.920
it was originally going
to be just kind

00:10:53.920 --> 00:10:57.590
of almost spoofing the
two genres in the process

00:10:57.590 --> 00:10:59.800
of bumping them against each other.

00:10:59.800 --> 00:11:02.360
But over the course of writing
it, you know, it became more

00:11:02.360 --> 00:11:07.200
of a relationship story, and the
approach to genre became much more

00:11:07.200 --> 00:11:11.150
like these are two different world
views that these characters have,

00:11:11.150 --> 00:11:13.700
and in particular like, you know,
one of the things that I did

00:11:13.700 --> 00:11:17.150
when I was revising the book
endlessly was like I just would,

00:11:17.150 --> 00:11:19.880
you know, kind of peep myself
up and ask like what is this,

00:11:19.880 --> 00:11:22.900
what am I actually, what's really
going on here, what's really going

00:11:22.900 --> 00:11:24.200
on with these characters?

00:11:24.200 --> 00:11:25.580
Why are they acting like this?

00:11:25.580 --> 00:11:27.680
What am I trying to explore here?

00:11:27.680 --> 00:11:29.190
What am I thinking?

00:11:29.190 --> 00:11:31.020
Why am I doing this in this book?

00:11:31.020 --> 00:11:34.790 position:56%
And I kind of felt like genre became
a way of kind of focusing intent

00:11:34.790 --> 00:11:37.070
and having more intentionality.

00:11:37.070 --> 00:11:41.110 position:56%
I kind of feel like the unexamined
story is not worth writing in a way.

00:11:41.110 --> 00:11:45.070
And like I'm a big believer in kind
of just continuing to pull it apart

00:11:45.070 --> 00:11:50.530
over and over again, and so for me
in the end genre became, you know,

00:11:50.530 --> 00:11:52.220
the failure mode of genre is

00:11:52.220 --> 00:11:54.610
that it dictates what's going
to happen in this story.

00:11:54.610 --> 00:11:56.850 position:56%
Like it's a thriller, so there's got

00:11:56.850 --> 00:11:59.480
to be a ticking time
bomb on page 300.

00:11:59.480 --> 00:12:00.920
There's got to be a building,

00:12:00.920 --> 00:12:03.600
or a hundred buildings
blowing up on page 400.

00:12:03.600 --> 00:12:06.550
There's got to be a car chase,
or whatever, and that's sort

00:12:06.550 --> 00:12:07.850
of a failure mode, but I think

00:12:07.850 --> 00:12:11.930
that what genre can do wonderfully
is kind of just focus you

00:12:11.930 --> 00:12:16.400
on a particular set of ideas
or a particular set of meanings

00:12:16.400 --> 00:12:21.180
or world views and let you kind
of delve into that and think

00:12:21.180 --> 00:12:24.230
about like what is this
actually, why is this so powerful,

00:12:24.230 --> 00:12:27.080
why is this speaking to
me and how can I help it

00:12:27.080 --> 00:12:29.140
to speak to other people kind of.

00:12:29.140 --> 00:12:32.990
&gt;&gt; Barrie Hardymon: It's really a,
because there are so many elements

00:12:32.990 --> 00:12:35.250
in it, and there are a lot
of what's really pleasurable

00:12:35.250 --> 00:12:38.100
for whether you know the
reference or not or that it is sort

00:12:38.100 --> 00:12:39.970
of crammed full of a lot of, you
know, like Rendorf [phonetic]

00:12:39.970 --> 00:12:42.680
and Dr. Who, and there are all
these Easter eggs for, you know,

00:12:42.680 --> 00:12:45.190 position:56%
but I can still give this book to my
mother, and she would still love it

00:12:45.190 --> 00:12:47.510
on the merits of not
knowing Dr. Who.

00:12:47.510 --> 00:12:49.300
But that's so, but I
guess what I wonder,

00:12:49.300 --> 00:12:53.250
as you were building this world,
which has a lot of, as you say,

00:12:53.250 --> 00:12:58.200
different world moods, is there a
fear, was there an editing process

00:12:58.200 --> 00:13:00.710 position:56%
where you worried about diluting by,

00:13:00.710 --> 00:13:03.420
do you know what I mean,
like so many genres?

00:13:03.420 --> 00:13:04.870
&gt;&gt; Charlie Jane Anders:
Yeah, I mean,

00:13:04.870 --> 00:13:06.290
I wasn't worried about diluting.

00:13:06.290 --> 00:13:10.660 position:56%
I mean in general, like even from
early on with this book I felt like,

00:13:10.660 --> 00:13:14.540
you know, I had like, you kind
of make a bargain with the reader

00:13:14.540 --> 00:13:16.800
in a way in terms of like how
much stuff you can get away

00:13:16.800 --> 00:13:18.450
with putting into a book.

00:13:18.450 --> 00:13:22.500
Like how many different weird
elements you could put into a book

00:13:22.500 --> 00:13:26.830
and like, you know, okay, so if
I've got like this super computer,

00:13:26.830 --> 00:13:29.810
and I've got this like,
you know, magical tree,

00:13:29.810 --> 00:13:32.910
and I've got this other stuff, you
know, are people going to be like,

00:13:32.910 --> 00:13:36.640
okay, that's it, that's all we're
going to let you have, you know,

00:13:36.640 --> 00:13:38.540
you kind of have, like, no more.

00:13:38.540 --> 00:13:41.900
We've accepted those things, we're
not going to accept anything else.

00:13:41.900 --> 00:13:45.910 position:56%
And like the bargain I kept making
in my head with the reader was okay,

00:13:45.910 --> 00:13:48.880
you know, you go with me for like
the talking birds on page three

00:13:48.880 --> 00:13:51.420
or whatever, you go with
me for this other stuff.

00:13:51.420 --> 00:13:54.740
I'm going to, the promise
that I make to you in return

00:13:54.740 --> 00:13:57.950
for accepting all this outlandish
stuff that kind of doesn't seem

00:13:57.950 --> 00:14:00.760
like it ought to fit together
in one book is that I'm going

00:14:00.760 --> 00:14:04.580 position:56%
to stay super narrowly focused on
these two characters, and it's going

00:14:04.580 --> 00:14:09.170
to be very emotionally grounded,
and I'm never going to let all

00:14:09.170 --> 00:14:11.870
of the shiny objects
kind of distract me

00:14:11.870 --> 00:14:13.470
from the story of these two people.

00:14:13.470 --> 00:14:15.420
And I feel like as long
as I kept playing off

00:14:15.420 --> 00:14:19.020
that promise I could get away with
kind of working in more stuff.

00:14:19.020 --> 00:14:22.810
And there was also stuff that was
just at margins so that like some

00:14:22.810 --> 00:14:26.700
of the geekiest stuff in the book,
you know, wasn't like, you know,

00:14:26.700 --> 00:14:29.960
you have to understand this to
get what's going on kind of.

00:14:29.960 --> 00:14:31.260
&gt;&gt; Barrie Hardymon: Yeah,

00:14:31.260 --> 00:14:32.980
they're just little Easter
eggs that are there for you.

00:14:32.980 --> 00:14:38.840
What's so satisfying about, because
it is, about having two people

00:14:38.840 --> 00:14:42.990
from different worlds-- I guess
I'm about to ask you what's

00:14:42.990 --> 00:14:45.150
so satisfying about
world's colliding, I guess,

00:14:45.150 --> 00:14:47.570
what about people's
worlds' colliding.

00:14:47.570 --> 00:14:51.740
I just, it's such a, especially
when it comes to this kind

00:14:51.740 --> 00:14:53.230
of people that wouldn't normally.

00:14:53.230 --> 00:14:56.710
Like I can't think of
another book in which a witch

00:14:56.710 --> 00:14:59.340
and a scientist have
this relationship.

00:14:59.340 --> 00:15:02.330
You know. And there's something
so satisfying about it,

00:15:02.330 --> 00:15:05.510
and with these two characters, I
just am, what was so satisfying

00:15:05.510 --> 00:15:08.350
about writing this match.

00:15:08.350 --> 00:15:10.920
&gt;&gt; Charlie Jane Anders:
I mean I think it was,

00:15:10.920 --> 00:15:14.380
again it was the world views, like
you mentioned, and it was this idea

00:15:14.380 --> 00:15:18.310
of like, you know, getting to
kind of explore magic in science

00:15:18.310 --> 00:15:23.910 position:56%
but also this think of like figuring
out who you are and like, you know,

00:15:23.910 --> 00:15:26.500
what I found really interesting,
like I wanted to have that thing

00:15:26.500 --> 00:15:29.650
where there are kids and then there
are adults, partly, like I said,

00:15:29.650 --> 00:15:32.840
to do the thing of like what
happens after you come of age,

00:15:32.840 --> 00:15:34.780
but also I found it
really interesting

00:15:34.780 --> 00:15:37.710
to see how their relationship
changes when they're adults

00:15:37.710 --> 00:15:39.010
versus when they're kids.

00:15:39.010 --> 00:15:40.830
Like they're such different
people as adults,

00:15:40.830 --> 00:15:45.530
but all that history is still
there, and so I got really excited

00:15:45.530 --> 00:15:50.060
to see how their relationship
kind of evolved in adulthood, and,

00:15:50.060 --> 00:15:52.360
you know, I think in
general I've always really,

00:15:52.360 --> 00:15:55.170
I think that the romance
in particular is a genre

00:15:55.170 --> 00:16:01.540 position:56%
that lends itself super well to like
very different world views and like,

00:16:01.540 --> 00:16:03.810
you know, I actually
kind of hate that movie,

00:16:03.810 --> 00:16:05.310
but You've Got Mail, or whatever--

00:16:05.310 --> 00:16:06.610
&gt;&gt; Barrie Hardymon: Oh yeah, yeah.

00:16:06.610 --> 00:16:07.910
&gt;&gt; Charlie Jane Anders:
Where he's like the big,

00:16:07.910 --> 00:16:12.090
the Borders bookstore guy and
she's the like small bookstore--

00:16:12.090 --> 00:16:13.390
&gt;&gt; Barrie Hardymon: The
shop around the corner.

00:16:13.390 --> 00:16:14.690
&gt;&gt; Charlie Jane Anders: Like
he drives her out of business

00:16:14.690 --> 00:16:17.080
or whatever, and like it's
a weird, weird, weird movie,

00:16:17.080 --> 00:16:18.700
but that's the kind of
quintessential thing

00:16:18.700 --> 00:16:22.050
of like they have radically
different viewpoints

00:16:22.050 --> 00:16:26.210
and opposing ideas and like how
can they make it work or whatever,

00:16:26.210 --> 00:16:28.100
and the reason I hate
that movie is not so much

00:16:28.100 --> 00:16:31.360 position:56%
because of the bookstore stuff,
which is a little bit, gets kind of,

00:16:31.360 --> 00:16:35.490 position:56%
it's weird how it touches on that,
but also just the fact that he knows

00:16:35.490 --> 00:16:39.160
from early on the movie who she is,
and she doesn't find out who he is

00:16:39.160 --> 00:16:42.330
until the end and there's
this weird power differential

00:16:42.330 --> 00:16:45.040
that movie totally loves, but
anyway, that's a [inaudible].

00:16:45.040 --> 00:16:46.370
&gt;&gt; Barrie Hardymon: I am
totally with you on that.

00:16:46.370 --> 00:16:48.460 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Charlie Jane Anders: You know, I
was just, I hadn't thought for years

00:16:48.460 --> 00:16:52.050
about how much I hate that movie,
but that movie, I hated it.

00:16:52.050 --> 00:16:53.350
Anyways, so--

00:16:53.350 --> 00:16:54.650
&gt;&gt; Barrie Hardymon:
It's a great love letter

00:16:54.650 --> 00:16:55.950
to the upper west side,
but that's about it.

00:16:55.950 --> 00:16:57.250
&gt;&gt; Charlie Jane Anders: Oh my God.

00:16:57.250 --> 00:16:59.030
Yeah, anyways, sorry,
that was a total sidebar.

00:16:59.030 --> 00:17:00.400
&gt;&gt; Barrie Hardymon: Sorry.

00:17:00.400 --> 00:17:02.110
&gt;&gt; Charlie Jane Anders: But
that thing, and like, you know,

00:17:02.110 --> 00:17:04.900
part of what happened with this
book is I had written the story,

00:17:04.900 --> 00:17:09.580 position:56%
Six Months, Three Days, that was
another kind of love story which we,

00:17:09.580 --> 00:17:12.840
two clairvoyants, and you know,

00:17:12.840 --> 00:17:15.180
she sees many different
possible futures,

00:17:15.180 --> 00:17:19.010
and he sees one fixed future, so
it was like almost the purest form

00:17:19.010 --> 00:17:22.470
of like we have incompatible
views of the world,

00:17:22.470 --> 00:17:24.040
and how do you make that work.

00:17:24.040 --> 00:17:26.780
And so I kind of loved
doing that, and I, you know,

00:17:26.780 --> 00:17:29.520
I feel like after this I don't
want to do it again for a while,

00:17:29.520 --> 00:17:31.150
but I really enjoyed doing it.

00:17:31.150 --> 00:17:32.450
&gt;&gt; Barrie Hardymon: So no sequel?

00:17:32.450 --> 00:17:33.750
&gt;&gt; Charlie Jane Anders: Oh
there's, no, there's no sequel.

00:17:33.750 --> 00:17:35.050
&gt;&gt; Barrie Hardymon: Really?

00:17:35.050 --> 00:17:37.520
I read, [inaudible]
I thought maybe, no?

00:17:37.520 --> 00:17:38.820
&gt;&gt; Charlie Jane Anders: No.

00:17:38.820 --> 00:17:40.120
I mean I don't know how
you follow up that ending,

00:17:40.120 --> 00:17:41.810
but also I do have
a short story coming

00:17:41.810 --> 00:17:44.150
out at some point about
Patricia's cat.

00:17:44.150 --> 00:17:45.450
&gt;&gt; Barrie Hardymon: Oh.

00:17:45.450 --> 00:17:46.750
&gt;&gt; Charlie Jane Anders: Because
I've had people come up to me

00:17:46.750 --> 00:17:49.240
and be like, you know,
what happened to the cat.

00:17:49.240 --> 00:17:50.630
&gt;&gt; Barrie Hardymon:
That's a good question.

00:17:50.630 --> 00:17:52.760
&gt;&gt; Charlie Jane Anders: And like
I've had people be like, you know,

00:17:52.760 --> 00:17:56.220 position:56%
I would have liked this book except
that there's the cat loose end like,

00:17:56.220 --> 00:18:00.260
and I can't like a book where the
cat is not dealt with or whatever.

00:18:00.260 --> 00:18:01.560
&gt;&gt; Barrie Hardymon: Right.

00:18:01.560 --> 00:18:02.860
&gt;&gt; Charlie Jane Anders: Dealt
with is a sense of like, you know,

00:18:02.860 --> 00:18:04.160
but where the cat's going to walk.

00:18:04.160 --> 00:18:05.460
&gt;&gt; Barrie Hardymon: I think
that's a great episode title,

00:18:05.460 --> 00:18:06.760
dealing with the cat.

00:18:06.760 --> 00:18:08.060
&gt;&gt; Charlie Jane Anders: Yeah.

00:18:08.060 --> 00:18:10.290
So there's the story about the cat,
but other than that, no, no sequel.

00:18:10.290 --> 00:18:11.590
&gt;&gt; Barrie Hardymon: Okay.

00:18:11.590 --> 00:18:12.890
All right.

00:18:12.890 --> 00:18:14.190
I'll get over it.

00:18:14.190 --> 00:18:17.170
But so I do want to ask you,
because I know we're not going

00:18:17.170 --> 00:18:20.890
to use the D word, but there's
definitely some depression

00:18:20.890 --> 00:18:24.150
happening, some sadness
happening in the world.

00:18:24.150 --> 00:18:25.450
&gt;&gt; Charlie Jane Anders: Right.

00:18:25.450 --> 00:18:29.950
&gt;&gt; Barrie Hardymon: And if humanity
is on the verge of, in the book,

00:18:29.950 --> 00:18:32.460
humanity is clearly on the
verge of destroying itself,

00:18:32.460 --> 00:18:35.010
and everybody has different ideas

00:18:35.010 --> 00:18:36.810
about what drastic
measures need to be taken.

00:18:36.810 --> 00:18:39.580
I guess, what is your
thought, is this something on,

00:18:39.580 --> 00:18:42.420
I always want to ask people
who write about this, you know,

00:18:42.420 --> 00:18:44.730
the future that looks scary
about what, is this something

00:18:44.730 --> 00:18:48.450
that keeps you up at night or
does it, is it a soothing balm

00:18:48.450 --> 00:18:51.460
to the, a flood that you see.

00:18:51.460 --> 00:18:52.760
Do you know what I mean?

00:18:52.760 --> 00:18:55.420
Does it, is it cathartic,
or is it something

00:18:55.420 --> 00:18:58.240 position:56%
that you think about in another way.

00:18:58.240 --> 00:19:00.700
Are you working it out on the page?

00:19:00.700 --> 00:19:02.000
What are you working
out on the page?

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:03.300
&gt;&gt; Charlie Jane Anders: Yeah.

00:19:03.300 --> 00:19:04.830
I mean first of all I want
to point out that actually

00:19:04.830 --> 00:19:08.190
in the book I'm very
careful to make it clear

00:19:08.190 --> 00:19:11.170
that people have the opinion
that humanity is on the verge

00:19:11.170 --> 00:19:13.730
of destroying itself, and actually
I have one character at one point

00:19:13.730 --> 00:19:16.400
who says, oh, people are
just being drama queens

00:19:16.400 --> 00:19:18.670
and this is just an adjustment
in our standard of living,

00:19:18.670 --> 00:19:21.660
and we'll be fine, and I wanted
to include that in there partly

00:19:21.660 --> 00:19:25.270
because I feel like you would
never really know for sure,

00:19:25.270 --> 00:19:27.770
like it's not like there would
be like a giant billboard,

00:19:27.770 --> 00:19:29.070
and like one of the things that,

00:19:29.070 --> 00:19:31.010
getting back to the ticking
time bomb that you have

00:19:31.010 --> 00:19:34.450
in like a thriller sometimes, I
wanted it to be very much like,

00:19:34.450 --> 00:19:39.910 position:56%
well, there may be a catastrophe
that ends the human race due to some

00:19:39.910 --> 00:19:43.810
of the things that have happened,
and it, we think it's likely,

00:19:43.810 --> 00:19:47.590
we think it might be in the next
anywhere from six months to 20

00:19:47.590 --> 00:19:49.350
or 30 years, and like I feel like--

00:19:49.350 --> 00:19:50.650
&gt;&gt; Barrie Hardymon:
That's not helpful.

00:19:50.650 --> 00:19:53.030
&gt;&gt; Charlie Jane Anders: I
feel like that kind of in,

00:19:53.030 --> 00:19:56.850
that kind of indistinct
timeline or whatever,

00:19:56.850 --> 00:20:00.320
that kind of confusing timeline,
makes it feel more real to me,

00:20:00.320 --> 00:20:03.580
that like, you know, versus
like where there's like a clock

00:20:03.580 --> 00:20:07.200
or something, but, yeah,
I mean I feel like,

00:20:07.200 --> 00:20:10.250
I mean Kim Stanley Robinson
has talked about this a lot,

00:20:10.250 --> 00:20:13.380
and if you ever get a chance to
hear him speak, he's incredible.

00:20:13.380 --> 00:20:18.320
He talks about a lot in his books
he deals a lot with the idea that,

00:20:18.320 --> 00:20:23.730
you know, environmental crisis
or environmental problems are

00:20:23.730 --> 00:20:26.810
in our future, and you can't
really write about the future

00:20:26.810 --> 00:20:30.920
without at least dealing with that
idea that there's going to be,

00:20:30.920 --> 00:20:33.000
that the icecaps are going to
melt, there's going to be flooding,

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:35.130
we're going to have some problems.

00:20:35.130 --> 00:20:39.240
There's going to be food shortages.

00:20:39.240 --> 00:20:42.860 position:56%
And I do worry about that a lot, and
I do feel kind of a responsibility

00:20:42.860 --> 00:20:48.090
to kind of, to at least touch on
that in the book, and it did kind

00:20:48.090 --> 00:20:51.150
of play into the whole science
and nature thing, and I, again,

00:20:51.150 --> 00:20:53.580
not wanting to like bludgeon
or lecture the reader,

00:20:53.580 --> 00:20:56.860
I wanted to at least include,
I mean I think it's something

00:20:56.860 --> 00:21:00.480 position:56%
that everybody worries about to some
extent if you are paying attention

00:21:00.480 --> 00:21:03.760
to what's happening in the news
and to what science is telling us

00:21:03.760 --> 00:21:08.780
about our, you know, perhaps
not terribly distant future,

00:21:08.780 --> 00:21:13.160
it's something that's a huge source
of anxiety for a lot of people.

00:21:13.160 --> 00:21:15.090
I think that there's,
I mean, you know,

00:21:15.090 --> 00:21:18.640
obviously post-apocalyptic stories
have an element of wish fulfillment

00:21:18.640 --> 00:21:21.800
if you get to be one of the
lucky, people who survive the end

00:21:21.800 --> 00:21:24.950
of the world, and if you
neighbors become zombies you get

00:21:24.950 --> 00:21:28.340
to shoot your neighbors in the
head, and that's kind of awesome.

00:21:28.340 --> 00:21:30.050
But, you know, they'll
never complain

00:21:30.050 --> 00:21:32.270
about my noise again [gun
cocking noise], you know.

00:21:32.270 --> 00:21:36.980
&gt;&gt; Barrie Hardymon: I'm going to
have the biggest party [laughter].

00:21:36.980 --> 00:21:38.360
&gt;&gt; Charlie Jane Anders:
Yeah, anyway.

00:21:38.360 --> 00:21:41.340
You know, and you get to like just,
you never have to go to work again.

00:21:41.340 --> 00:21:44.140
You never have to get
another oil change ever again

00:21:44.140 --> 00:21:45.440
for as long as you live.

00:21:45.440 --> 00:21:48.450
You don't have to worry about
your mortgage ever again.

00:21:48.450 --> 00:21:50.580
But, you know, I think
that it's something

00:21:50.580 --> 00:21:52.940
that we're all a little
bit, you know, terrified of,

00:21:52.940 --> 00:21:57.590
and I think that, you know, I've
always thought science fiction

00:21:57.590 --> 00:22:01.690
and fantasy has like a unique
ability and maybe even a duty

00:22:01.690 --> 00:22:05.460
to deal with the big questions
about what's going to happen to us,

00:22:05.460 --> 00:22:08.890
and I feel like, in a very
small way I try to kind

00:22:08.890 --> 00:22:11.140
of grapple with that in this book.

00:22:11.140 --> 00:22:12.500
&gt;&gt; Barrie Hardymon:
I like to, there's a,

00:22:12.500 --> 00:22:16.800
like I said it's very relatable,
and there is this feeling that,

00:22:16.800 --> 00:22:19.650
you know, as, as maybe
the apocalypse approaches

00:22:19.650 --> 00:22:22.130 position:56%
like people are still going to maybe
be on social media and they're going

00:22:22.130 --> 00:22:23.570
to be complaining about hipsters.

00:22:23.570 --> 00:22:24.870
&gt;&gt; Charlie Jane Anders: Yeah.

00:22:24.870 --> 00:22:26.170
&gt;&gt; Barrie Hardymon: And
they're going to, you know,

00:22:26.170 --> 00:22:28.180
have this real emotional
life, and it's funny,

00:22:28.180 --> 00:22:33.170
but it's also really this
kindness, this kind of domesticness

00:22:33.170 --> 00:22:39.260 position:56%
to the way that, you know, because
it always bothers me in those movies

00:22:39.260 --> 00:22:41.100
where you would think that
somebody would be like,

00:22:41.100 --> 00:22:42.750
do you think this is it.

00:22:42.750 --> 00:22:45.830
But your characters do have,
like there is this kind of,

00:22:45.830 --> 00:22:49.010
there's a real talk about,
you know, where humanity it.

00:22:49.010 --> 00:22:55.330
And I guess that kind of really
brings me to the, like you said,

00:22:55.330 --> 00:22:58.600
there's the part of the like
moving toward the long slide,

00:22:58.600 --> 00:23:00.640
and then there's a post.

00:23:00.640 --> 00:23:03.370
Does the post, does that
world interest you at all,

00:23:03.370 --> 00:23:07.360
or are you really just into
the slide, or is the journey--

00:23:07.360 --> 00:23:09.740
&gt;&gt; Charlie Jane Anders: I feel like
at this point I've read and seen

00:23:09.740 --> 00:23:13.720
so many post-apocalyptic stories
that it would be really hard for me

00:23:13.720 --> 00:23:16.430
to come up with one that
excited me to write.

00:23:16.430 --> 00:23:18.310
I mean I've written a
couple of short stories

00:23:18.310 --> 00:23:23.330
that are post-apocalyptic, that
have like a different twist on it,

00:23:23.330 --> 00:23:27.740
but I feel like that's, you
know, one of the most kind

00:23:27.740 --> 00:23:31.200
of commonly used story
settings or ideas right now.

00:23:31.200 --> 00:23:34.630
It's the kind of after the
apocalypse, And I don't know,

00:23:34.630 --> 00:23:38.460
it's hard for me to even imagine
writing that at this point.

00:23:38.460 --> 00:23:41.540
I mean my next novel I'm working
on right now is actually set

00:23:41.540 --> 00:23:46.140
on another planet and like maybe
a thousand years in the future

00:23:46.140 --> 00:23:48.490
with humans colonizing
another planet,

00:23:48.490 --> 00:23:52.840
and I feel like in a way people
having to live on another planet

00:23:52.840 --> 00:23:56.760
with just whatever we brought from
earth and whatever we can scrounge

00:23:56.760 --> 00:24:02.490
on the planet's surface is kind of
like a post-apocalyptic scenario

00:24:02.490 --> 00:24:04.760
in a way because, you know,

00:24:04.760 --> 00:24:06.980
you arrive with a certain
amount of civilization.

00:24:06.980 --> 00:24:08.280
&gt;&gt; Barrie Hardymon:
Limited [inaudible].

00:24:08.280 --> 00:24:09.580
Yeah.

00:24:09.580 --> 00:24:10.880
&gt;&gt; Charlie Jane Anders: Yeah.

00:24:10.880 --> 00:24:12.180
You have your awesome computers
and your shiny machines,

00:24:12.180 --> 00:24:14.570
and then maybe a few
hundred years go by.

00:24:14.570 --> 00:24:16.330
A lot of those things break down.

00:24:16.330 --> 00:24:18.310
You can't necessarily
get the silicone

00:24:18.310 --> 00:24:21.510
or whatever else you
need to fix them.

00:24:21.510 --> 00:24:24.700
Maybe it's not as easy
to get back up into orbit

00:24:24.700 --> 00:24:26.880
as you thought it was
going to be, and you know,

00:24:26.880 --> 00:24:30.000
things just get tougher,
and so that's kind of like,

00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:32.640
I've thought about how
that's kind of my answer

00:24:32.640 --> 00:24:36.540 position:56%
to doing a post-apocalyptic story
is just do a story on another planet

00:24:36.540 --> 00:24:40.230
where it's just, things are really
different, and trying to hold

00:24:40.230 --> 00:24:42.990
onto civilization is kind of hard.

00:24:42.990 --> 00:24:44.560
&gt;&gt; Barrie Hardymon: I think you
just answered another question

00:24:44.560 --> 00:24:45.860
that I had, but I--

00:24:45.860 --> 00:24:47.160
&gt;&gt; Charlie Jane Anders: Sorry.

00:24:47.160 --> 00:24:48.460 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Barrie Hardymon: No, that's good.

00:24:48.460 --> 00:24:50.830
I can, I'm following up, which
is when you thought about this,

00:24:50.830 --> 00:24:53.700
it seems like Patricia
and Lawrence came first.

00:24:53.700 --> 00:24:55.000
&gt;&gt; Charlie Jane Anders: Yeah.

00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:57.690
&gt;&gt; Barrie Hardymon: But here you're
talking about setting coming first.

00:24:57.690 --> 00:24:58.990
&gt;&gt; Charlie Jane Anders: Oh, yeah.

00:24:58.990 --> 00:25:00.290
&gt;&gt; Barrie Hardymon: But how
do you, how do you grapple

00:25:00.290 --> 00:25:02.560
with like the world or the people
you're going to put in the world

00:25:02.560 --> 00:25:06.000
as you create your story, as
you do your story telling.

00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:07.320
&gt;&gt; Charlie Jane Anders: Yeah,
I mean it's really tough.

00:25:07.320 --> 00:25:11.080
Every story, every novel is
different, and like All the Birds

00:25:11.080 --> 00:25:14.120
in the Sky definitely started
with these two characters

00:25:14.120 --> 00:25:17.320
and nothing else, and it
was just like what kind

00:25:17.320 --> 00:25:21.370
of world does it make sense for
them to be in, and you know,

00:25:21.370 --> 00:25:24.760
especially with Patricia, I had to
come up with a whole world of magic

00:25:24.760 --> 00:25:27.780
that she could belong to
that was not just, you know,

00:25:27.780 --> 00:25:32.380
a painted backdrop or like she'll
go to a school called Hogfarts

00:25:32.380 --> 00:25:35.760
or whatever, you know,
[laughter] I don't know.

00:25:35.760 --> 00:25:38.490
I had to come up with something
that was different and, you know,

00:25:38.490 --> 00:25:42.890 position:56%
hopefully unique and interesting in
its own way, and with Lawrence I had

00:25:42.890 --> 00:25:45.560 position:56%
to come up with a world of like
[inaudible] that felt like our world

00:25:45.560 --> 00:25:48.050 position:56%
but different in an interesting way.

00:25:48.050 --> 00:25:51.310
And so, you know, sometimes you
start with characters and you kind

00:25:51.310 --> 00:25:54.630
of work your way up to setting,
and then with this next book,

00:25:54.630 --> 00:25:57.500
I started with setting, and I
had some ideas about characters,

00:25:57.500 --> 00:25:59.770
but that's been a real struggle.

00:25:59.770 --> 00:26:04.150
It's been a very different approach
to writing, and it's been kind of,

00:26:04.150 --> 00:26:07.450
you know, the last couple years
have been really interesting.

00:26:07.450 --> 00:26:09.330
I've been kind of banging my
head up against the wall trying

00:26:09.330 --> 00:26:12.920
to like create characters
who feel real

00:26:12.920 --> 00:26:15.970 position:56%
in this very different setting that,
you know, I can get excited about.

00:26:15.970 --> 00:26:17.270
&gt;&gt; Barrie Hardymon:
That's interesting.

00:26:17.270 --> 00:26:18.570
&gt;&gt; Charlie Jane Anders: And it's
only been in the last few months

00:26:18.570 --> 00:26:21.380
that I've really felt
like I've gotten there.

00:26:21.380 --> 00:26:24.690
So it's been really tough.

00:26:24.690 --> 00:26:26.960 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Barrie Hardymon: I read that your
first novel was a literary novel

00:26:26.960 --> 00:26:31.470
of just a like, not
magic, not sci-fi.

00:26:31.470 --> 00:26:32.770
&gt;&gt; Charlie Jane Anders: Yeah.

00:26:32.770 --> 00:26:35.070
&gt;&gt; Barrie Hardymon: It started
in this other, this other world,

00:26:35.070 --> 00:26:40.870
and I wonder how did you then make
the trip to the other, to genre.

00:26:40.870 --> 00:26:42.170
&gt;&gt; Charlie Jane Anders:
Yeah, I mean it's,

00:26:42.170 --> 00:26:44.820
I had an interesting relationship
with genre over the years.

00:26:44.820 --> 00:26:49.220 position:56%
Like I started out my first like few
years writing fiction I was writing

00:26:49.220 --> 00:26:52.370
nothing but science fiction and
got almost none of it published,

00:26:52.370 --> 00:26:55.340
or it was published in
very small magazines.

00:26:55.340 --> 00:27:00.400
And then I decided to
try writing other genres,

00:27:00.400 --> 00:27:02.940
and I wrote a few things,
but I wrote,

00:27:02.940 --> 00:27:05.700
I wrote a lot of literary fiction,
and I actually got published

00:27:05.700 --> 00:27:08.930
in some pretty decent
literary magazines.

00:27:08.930 --> 00:27:13.800
And like I had a thing
in McSweeney's and stuff.

00:27:13.800 --> 00:27:19.270
And what I found interesting about
the literary fiction was, you know,

00:27:19.270 --> 00:27:23.550 position:56%
it forced me to stop thinking in
terms of like a plot device or like,

00:27:23.550 --> 00:27:28.800
okay, what if there's like a space
ship that can go faster than light

00:27:28.800 --> 00:27:32.080
but only if everybody on board
is feeling guilty or something,

00:27:32.080 --> 00:27:34.400
which was one of my really
dumb stories that I wrote.

00:27:34.400 --> 00:27:35.700
Don't even ask.

00:27:35.700 --> 00:27:37.000
It was a terrible story.

00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:39.460
&gt;&gt; Barrie Hardymon: That's like
my mother' car, I like that.

00:27:39.460 --> 00:27:41.510
[laughter] Just kidding.

00:27:41.510 --> 00:27:42.910
&gt;&gt; Charlie Jane Anders:
But you know, so I had,

00:27:42.910 --> 00:27:45.380
I was coming up with lots
of like zany plot devices

00:27:45.380 --> 00:27:48.910 position:56%
and zany plot ideas, and so
writing literary fiction was one way

00:27:48.910 --> 00:27:53.200
to force myself to kind of think
just in terms of character.

00:27:53.200 --> 00:27:57.620 position:56%
And that novel actually was one
where like I wrote a bunch of stuff,

00:27:57.620 --> 00:28:01.100
and like there was one character
who was a really minor character,

00:28:01.100 --> 00:28:03.670
who just I got interested in,
and I just started writing

00:28:03.670 --> 00:28:06.930
about that character,
Barry, almost exclusively,

00:28:06.930 --> 00:28:10.200
and that became the story of this
one character, that just came

00:28:10.200 --> 00:28:13.790
out of all these other characters
who failed to be main characters.

00:28:13.790 --> 00:28:16.750
And so that was a really fun
process, but I wrote a lot of,

00:28:16.750 --> 00:28:18.870
I still write, quote,
unquote, literary fiction,

00:28:18.870 --> 00:28:22.460
occasionally without genre
elements, and it's fun.

00:28:22.460 --> 00:28:25.170
It's fun to just sort
of have like characters

00:28:25.170 --> 00:28:28.470
in a situation that's quote,
unquote, realistic, and there's no

00:28:28.470 --> 00:28:32.590
like what if element, and I
felt like when I went back

00:28:32.590 --> 00:28:34.970
to writing science fiction and
fantasy, I kind of brought more

00:28:34.970 --> 00:28:39.450
of that back with me a little
bit, and I was able to just think

00:28:39.450 --> 00:28:42.340
about character a little bit
earlier in the process maybe

00:28:42.340 --> 00:28:43.840
than I had been doing before.

00:28:43.840 --> 00:28:45.140
&gt;&gt; Barrie Hardymon:
That's interesting.

00:28:45.140 --> 00:28:46.570
&gt;&gt; Charlie Jane Anders: And so
it was a good side trip actually,

00:28:46.570 --> 00:28:48.290
it was a good--

00:28:48.290 --> 00:28:50.070
&gt;&gt; Barrie Hardymon: But you
started with science fiction.

00:28:50.070 --> 00:28:51.370
&gt;&gt; Charlie Jane Anders: Yeah.

00:28:51.370 --> 00:28:52.670
&gt;&gt; Barrie Hardymon: And then
went-- oh that's interesting.

00:28:52.670 --> 00:28:53.970
&gt;&gt; Charlie Jane Anders: And my
early science fiction was terrible.

00:28:53.970 --> 00:28:55.740
I mean my early literary, my
early everything was terrible,

00:28:55.740 --> 00:28:58.680
and maybe in a few years
from now I'll look back

00:28:58.680 --> 00:29:00.920
at what I'm writing now and be
like, oh that was terrible, but,

00:29:00.920 --> 00:29:02.880
you know, I don't think, anyway.

00:29:02.880 --> 00:29:05.040
&gt;&gt; Barrie Hardymon: Did you always
know you'd make the trip back

00:29:05.040 --> 00:29:06.600
to science fiction and fantasy?

00:29:06.600 --> 00:29:08.780
&gt;&gt; Charlie Jane Anders: Probably
because that's like my first love,

00:29:08.780 --> 00:29:11.070
and that's what I've always
been most passionate about.

00:29:11.070 --> 00:29:14.450
I mean I've read, like I love
reading literary fiction.

00:29:14.450 --> 00:29:17.380
I've read like just tons
and tons of it, but I just,

00:29:17.380 --> 00:29:18.960
science fiction has a special
place in my heart, so--

00:29:18.960 --> 00:29:20.410
&gt;&gt; Barrie Hardymon: What
did you read as a kid?

00:29:20.410 --> 00:29:23.770
&gt;&gt; Charlie Jane Anders: As a kid,
I mean, I read a lot of like,

00:29:23.770 --> 00:29:26.460
you know, I was in England
for a while, so I read a lot

00:29:26.460 --> 00:29:29.000
of like Paddington
Bear book and like,

00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:31.760
I loved Lloyd Alexander's
Chronicles of Prydain.

00:29:31.760 --> 00:29:33.060
&gt;&gt; Barrie Hardymon: Yeah.

00:29:33.060 --> 00:29:34.360
&gt;&gt; Charlie Jane Anders:
Those are so great.

00:29:34.360 --> 00:29:35.660
Madeleine L'Engle.

00:29:35.660 --> 00:29:37.010
Madeleine L'Engle was huge
for me when I was a kid.

00:29:37.010 --> 00:29:38.310
Judy Blume.

00:29:38.310 --> 00:29:40.260
Just all that stuff, I don't know.

00:29:40.260 --> 00:29:44.760 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Barrie Hardymon: So when you dove
into sci-fi, what was your gateway?

00:29:44.760 --> 00:29:46.250
&gt;&gt; Charlie Jane Anders:
Probably Douglas Adams.

00:29:46.250 --> 00:29:47.550
&gt;&gt; Barrie Hardymon: Oh yeah.

00:29:47.550 --> 00:29:48.850
&gt;&gt; Charlie Jane Anders: I
think Douglas Adams was like.

00:29:48.850 --> 00:29:50.410 position:56%
That was, I mean there were other
authors I read before Douglas Adams,

00:29:50.410 --> 00:29:54.430
but he was one that was just like,
you know, wacked over the head

00:29:54.430 --> 00:29:56.950
with like a two by four, and he's
always going to be like the kind

00:29:56.950 --> 00:30:00.440
of platonic ideal of what
great writing is to me kind of.

00:30:00.440 --> 00:30:04.950
He's so, like he just sets up
all these interesting situations,

00:30:04.950 --> 00:30:09.750
and he's so funny, and, you know,
he just has this ability to kind

00:30:09.750 --> 00:30:11.330
of just get to the heart

00:30:11.330 --> 00:30:14.200
of like what makes something
ridiculous in like a few sentence.

00:30:14.200 --> 00:30:18.460
&gt;&gt; Barrie Hardymon: That
is a thing about sci-fi,

00:30:18.460 --> 00:30:22.030
is that there is a sense of
like you can be ridiculous.

00:30:22.030 --> 00:30:23.330
&gt;&gt; Charlie Jane Anders: Yeah.

00:30:23.330 --> 00:30:24.630
&gt;&gt; Barrie Hardymon: In a way

00:30:24.630 --> 00:30:25.930
that you almost can't
as much with fantasy.

00:30:25.930 --> 00:30:29.340
Fantasy seems to have
it, to have more pride.

00:30:29.340 --> 00:30:33.480
It's not the right word, but
the thing I like about sci-fi,

00:30:33.480 --> 00:30:36.200
I mean I like them both
obviously, is that you have a,

00:30:36.200 --> 00:30:41.560
sci-fi allows you to do the crazy,
the compute is talking to you,

00:30:41.560 --> 00:30:44.390
and then it explodes in a
spaceship of guilt, you know.

00:30:44.390 --> 00:30:45.730
&gt;&gt; Charlie Jane Anders:
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:30:45.730 --> 00:30:47.850
&gt;&gt; Barrie Hardymon: But
what's freeing about fantasy?

00:30:47.850 --> 00:30:49.460
What's the freedom
in fantasy to you.

00:30:49.460 --> 00:30:51.310
&gt;&gt; Charlie Jane Anders: I mean,
I'm going to disagree slightly

00:30:51.310 --> 00:30:55.040
because I think Terry Pratchett is
like one of the funniest writers.

00:30:55.040 --> 00:30:56.340
&gt;&gt; Barrie Hardymon: Oh yeah.

00:30:56.340 --> 00:30:57.640
&gt;&gt; Charlie Jane Anders:
And I feel like--

00:30:57.640 --> 00:30:58.940
&gt;&gt; Barrie Hardymon: That's true.

00:30:58.940 --> 00:31:00.240
&gt;&gt; Charlie Jane Anders:
You know, he's,

00:31:00.240 --> 00:31:01.540 position:56%
I mean it's almost gotten harder to
be funny in science fiction the last

00:31:01.540 --> 00:31:03.900
like 20 or 30 years because it's
gone through more of a phase

00:31:03.900 --> 00:31:06.920
of taking itself seriously
again, I don't know.

00:31:06.920 --> 00:31:09.000
I think these things go
in phases or in waves.

00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:10.300
&gt;&gt; Barrie Hardymon: Yeah.

00:31:10.300 --> 00:31:11.750
&gt;&gt; Charlie Jane Anders: I think
that the thing about fantasy is

00:31:11.750 --> 00:31:14.560
that people get very
obsessed with the idea

00:31:14.560 --> 00:31:17.630
that magic should have
rules, which is, you know,

00:31:17.630 --> 00:31:19.300
there's a debate actually.

00:31:19.300 --> 00:31:23.430
N.K. Jemisin wrote a really amazing
essay a few years ago saying no

00:31:23.430 --> 00:31:25.380
magic doesn't have to have rules,

00:31:25.380 --> 00:31:28.150
it just has to make sense,
which is the same thing.

00:31:28.150 --> 00:31:30.500
Makes sense is like also like kind

00:31:30.500 --> 00:31:32.480
of for some values it
makes sense kind of.

00:31:32.480 --> 00:31:35.660
It has to just not feel like oh
anything can happen, it's magic,

00:31:35.660 --> 00:31:40.460
like, you know, whoo, nothing
matters, I can just, you know,

00:31:40.460 --> 00:31:44.630
any obstacle I can just walk
through because it's magic.

00:31:44.630 --> 00:31:46.360
You know, that kind of thing.

00:31:46.360 --> 00:31:48.430
But I think people get
very obsessed with the idea

00:31:48.430 --> 00:31:51.240
that magic should have
rules, and especially

00:31:51.240 --> 00:31:54.240
since George R. Martin came
along, there's this idea

00:31:54.240 --> 00:31:57.730
that magic should be
something that's not

00:31:57.730 --> 00:31:59.610
like overpowering in the world.

00:31:59.610 --> 00:32:02.870
Like Game of Thrones was like
a huge breath of fresh air

00:32:02.870 --> 00:32:05.580
because it's a world
that feels like just a,

00:32:05.580 --> 00:32:09.450 position:56%
kind of a naturalistic medieval
world, and there's just a little bit

00:32:09.450 --> 00:32:13.650
of magic in the first book, and
then it slowly kind of ratchets up.

00:32:13.650 --> 00:32:15.780
And I think people have
really embraced that.

00:32:15.780 --> 00:32:20.400
So I think if you try to just
go broadly comic with magic now,

00:32:20.400 --> 00:32:23.930
people might feel like okay you're
not taking it seriously enough,

00:32:23.930 --> 00:32:25.800
magic has to be respected.

00:32:25.800 --> 00:32:28.700
And I understand where that's
coming from because it's, you know,

00:32:28.700 --> 00:32:30.450
it's easy to just go, like I said,

00:32:30.450 --> 00:32:33.750
go crazy with like
anything can happen, whoo,

00:32:33.750 --> 00:32:35.620
and like that just gets annoying.

00:32:35.620 --> 00:32:39.610
So I think you have to respect,
you have to treat it right.

00:32:39.610 --> 00:32:41.010
&gt;&gt; Barrie Hardymon: And in
this book you really do.

00:32:41.010 --> 00:32:44.390
I note that you have healer
magic and trickster magic, right.

00:32:44.390 --> 00:32:46.640
You should explain that particular
role, because it's really,

00:32:46.640 --> 00:32:49.490
it's a lovely, it's a lovely idea.

00:32:49.490 --> 00:32:51.010
&gt;&gt; Charlie Jane Anders: Yeah, I
mean I was thinking, like I said,

00:32:51.010 --> 00:32:53.890
I was thinking about
like a world of magicians

00:32:53.890 --> 00:32:55.860
and how I could make it different

00:32:55.860 --> 00:32:57.590
from all these other fantasy
books I'd been reading,

00:32:57.590 --> 00:33:00.440
and somehow I stumbled on,
after like hours of just

00:33:00.440 --> 00:33:03.050
like banging my head against the
wall, I stumbled on this idea

00:33:03.050 --> 00:33:07.420
that like there were these
two schools of magic,

00:33:07.420 --> 00:33:10.400
and it felt like a way to kind of
honor the fact that there was a lot

00:33:10.400 --> 00:33:14.300
of different kinds of ways of
practicing magic in the real world.

00:33:14.300 --> 00:33:16.140
There were these two
schools of magic.

00:33:16.140 --> 00:33:19.000
Healer magic, which was just
sort of what it sounds like,

00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:20.760
you could use it to heal people.

00:33:20.760 --> 00:33:23.630 position:56%
You have to build a certain kind of
bond or connection with them usually

00:33:23.630 --> 00:33:28.510 position:56%
to use it, and then trickster magic,
where you can do almost anything

00:33:28.510 --> 00:33:32.460
if you can trick someone, if
you can like convince someone

00:33:32.460 --> 00:33:35.740
to like make a bargain with you
or if you can hoodwink someone

00:33:35.740 --> 00:33:38.990
in some way, you can get them
to give you all sorts of power.

00:33:38.990 --> 00:33:42.070
And these two schools had actually
been at odds for a long time

00:33:42.070 --> 00:33:45.200
and had almost gone to war,
and now they've been merged,

00:33:45.200 --> 00:33:48.430
and actually there was a sub-plot
that I had to cut out of the book

00:33:48.430 --> 00:33:50.860
where towards the end of the
book you find out that the truce

00:33:50.860 --> 00:33:54.400
between trickster magic and
healer magic isn't as complete

00:33:54.400 --> 00:33:57.760
as you thought and there's a
whole extra layer that I just was

00:33:57.760 --> 00:34:00.830
like this is too complicated,
it's got to go.

00:34:00.830 --> 00:34:03.030
But I can tell you about it after.

00:34:03.030 --> 00:34:04.330
&gt;&gt; Barrie Hardymon: Okay, good.

00:34:04.330 --> 00:34:07.190
&gt;&gt; Charlie Jane Anders: But
anyway, and I just liked the idea

00:34:07.190 --> 00:34:11.630 position:56%
that there was a history, and I came
up with a very complicated history,

00:34:11.630 --> 00:34:15.760
most of which is not in the
book, about how this came to pass

00:34:15.760 --> 00:34:17.800
and about how the war was averted.

00:34:17.800 --> 00:34:21.340 position:56%
There was this woman who was an
escaped slave from Barbados who went

00:34:21.340 --> 00:34:25.030
and became the greatest trickster
magician the world had ever known,

00:34:25.030 --> 00:34:27.550
and she was the one who
convinced them that tricksters

00:34:27.550 --> 00:34:30.530
and healers work better
together and that, you know,

00:34:30.530 --> 00:34:32.360 position:56%
each can do the other kind of magic.

00:34:32.360 --> 00:34:35.100
So that was something that
I really, I loved that idea

00:34:35.100 --> 00:34:38.440
that there had been like
this complicated history,

00:34:38.440 --> 00:34:41.280
that we only just touch on.

00:34:41.280 --> 00:34:43.090
&gt;&gt; Barrie Hardymon: I feel like
I should open this operation

00:34:43.090 --> 00:34:45.200 position:56%
to other people who may want to ask.

00:34:45.200 --> 00:34:49.390
Anybody want to come up to the mic?

00:34:49.390 --> 00:34:52.500
&gt;&gt; I was wondering, one of
the things you said struck me,

00:34:52.500 --> 00:34:56.880
and that was with your work on
IO9, you were exposed to so much

00:34:56.880 --> 00:35:00.290
of everything that's going on
with science fiction and fantasy,

00:35:00.290 --> 00:35:04.350
do you think that ultimately
that gives you inspiration

00:35:04.350 --> 00:35:07.380
because you get so many different
ideas or is it intimidating

00:35:07.380 --> 00:35:09.060
because any idea you can come

00:35:09.060 --> 00:35:12.100
up with you can think somebody
else has already done it.

00:35:12.100 --> 00:35:13.680
&gt;&gt; Charlie Jane Anders: You
know, it's a little of both.

00:35:13.680 --> 00:35:17.580
I really, when I was doing
IO9, I worried a lot at first

00:35:17.580 --> 00:35:21.020
that I was going to either
just get so like overwhelmed

00:35:21.020 --> 00:35:25.990
with like all the great and in some
cases not great science fiction

00:35:25.990 --> 00:35:30.500
and fantasy that I was reading and
watching and everything and also

00:35:30.500 --> 00:35:34.010
that my kind of critic voice would
get so loud that I wasn't going

00:35:34.010 --> 00:35:37.380
to be able to write, like I'd
just be constantly in critic mode

00:35:37.380 --> 00:35:42.330
or just constantly in snark mode or
whatever, and I found that actually

00:35:42.330 --> 00:35:45.370
for the most part, like it was
intimidating at times, like,

00:35:45.370 --> 00:35:47.830
you know, it's still intimidating
when I go to conventions

00:35:47.830 --> 00:35:50.940
and see all these writers whose
work I'm just like, you know,

00:35:50.940 --> 00:35:55.370
I've been in awe for
example, but at the same time,

00:35:55.370 --> 00:35:59.270
I just found it really like
getting, I talk about it

00:35:59.270 --> 00:36:01.570
as like getting paid
to go to grad school.

00:36:01.570 --> 00:36:06.220
Like I just got paid to read
so many great books and geek

00:36:06.220 --> 00:36:08.960 position:56%
out about stories and have all
these conversations with the readers

00:36:08.960 --> 00:36:12.740
of IO9 who were, you know, this
incredibly smart group of people

00:36:12.740 --> 00:36:17.470
who had like, I would come
out with a half, whatever,

00:36:17.470 --> 00:36:19.510
half-baked opinion, and they
would kind of come in with

00:36:19.510 --> 00:36:21.530
like all these interesting
ideas about it.

00:36:21.530 --> 00:36:23.480
And like it was just really fun.

00:36:23.480 --> 00:36:26.650 position:56%
It was getting to like have
seminars every day, and like I just,

00:36:26.650 --> 00:36:30.470
I found that like my ideas
about like what works

00:36:30.470 --> 00:36:34.020
and what doesn't work in stories
got a lot sharper after a few years

00:36:34.020 --> 00:36:37.050
of doing that because I would
have to think about like, okay,

00:36:37.050 --> 00:36:41.070
where did, you know, where did this
thing go wrong, or what's like,

00:36:41.070 --> 00:36:43.330
you know, the one thing
I keep coming back

00:36:43.330 --> 00:36:46.550
to for some reason today is
Looper, the Rian Johnson movie,

00:36:46.550 --> 00:36:49.360
how is that movie so great in
terms of how it uses time travel

00:36:49.360 --> 00:36:51.930
to tell this story,
how can I study that.

00:36:51.930 --> 00:36:55.980 position:56%
And just like, yeah, it was actually
in the end I felt like, you know,

00:36:55.980 --> 00:36:58.800
I mean if I start to think of
myself as trying to be as good

00:36:58.800 --> 00:37:02.820
as those creators then I get a
complex, but getting paid to think

00:37:02.820 --> 00:37:04.250 position:56%
about these things and how they work

00:37:04.250 --> 00:37:08.920
and what makes them work
was actually super awesome.

00:37:08.920 --> 00:37:10.490
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:37:10.490 --> 00:37:12.420
&gt;&gt; Charlie Jane Anders: Thank you.

00:37:12.420 --> 00:37:13.720
Hi.

00:37:13.720 --> 00:37:18.320
&gt;&gt; Hi. My question is also
tangentially IO9 related.

00:37:18.320 --> 00:37:19.620
&gt;&gt; Charlie Jane Anders: Okay.

00:37:19.620 --> 00:37:24.450
&gt;&gt; Just as, speaking as
someone who really hopes

00:37:24.450 --> 00:37:27.940
to make this lead myself
at some point, what is the,

00:37:27.940 --> 00:37:32.810
just the thought process like when
you finally decide, all right,

00:37:32.810 --> 00:37:37.700
I'm just gritting my teeth and
making fiction writing my day job.

00:37:37.700 --> 00:37:39.000
&gt;&gt; Charlie Jane Anders: Oh man.

00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:42.660
Yeah it's, I'm still, I'm still
second guessing that decision.

00:37:42.660 --> 00:37:44.140
I don't know, it's really tough.

00:37:44.140 --> 00:37:47.880
You know, basically what it was
is I needed a break from blogging.

00:37:47.880 --> 00:37:51.080
I had been doing it for eight and
a half years, and I just wanted

00:37:51.080 --> 00:37:54.440
to kind of take a step back
and not do that for a while.

00:37:54.440 --> 00:37:58.600
And All the Birds in the Sky
seemed to be getting, you know,

00:37:58.600 --> 00:38:02.390
people seemed to like it, and I
was like also having that problem

00:38:02.390 --> 00:38:04.540
that I mentioned earlier where I'd
been working on this other book

00:38:04.540 --> 00:38:07.760
for like two plus years,
and I still didn't feel

00:38:07.760 --> 00:38:09.060
like I had a handle on it.

00:38:09.060 --> 00:38:11.060
I had this setting that I had
spent so much time developing

00:38:11.060 --> 00:38:13.110
that I still think is
an amazing setting,

00:38:13.110 --> 00:38:16.280
and the characters were not
working at all, and I was just

00:38:16.280 --> 00:38:18.300
like this needs my
undivided attention.

00:38:18.300 --> 00:38:21.920 position:56%
But what I was, what I said was like
okay, I'll leave my job at the end

00:38:21.920 --> 00:38:26.020
of April and I'll give myself three
months to just work on fiction.

00:38:26.020 --> 00:38:29.530
At the end of that time, I'll
reassess, so like August.

00:38:29.530 --> 00:38:31.770
And I guess I'm still,
it's September now,

00:38:31.770 --> 00:38:36.310 position:56%
and I still haven't gotten another
job yet, so I guess it's going okay.

00:38:36.310 --> 00:38:39.490
It's like, you know, I'm
taking it month by month.

00:38:39.490 --> 00:38:41.440
It's not like it's permanent.

00:38:41.440 --> 00:38:44.270
I'll see what my bank account
looks like in another few months

00:38:44.270 --> 00:38:47.710
and also like, you know,
I'm just like eating a lot

00:38:47.710 --> 00:38:49.670
of ramen noodles, I don't know.

00:38:49.670 --> 00:38:53.120
But, you know, also just how
productive I can be every day.

00:38:53.120 --> 00:38:55.120
I feel like being your own boss,

00:38:55.120 --> 00:38:57.890
like I'm the worst
boss I've ever had.

00:38:57.890 --> 00:39:01.370
I'm really hard on myself if I'm
not like constantly just producing

00:39:01.370 --> 00:39:03.150
like tons and tons of stuff.

00:39:03.150 --> 00:39:07.380 position:56%
I'm really mean to myself about
that, and like so I'm still figuring

00:39:07.380 --> 00:39:09.310
out like, someone who
had made the leap

00:39:09.310 --> 00:39:14.910 position:56%
to full-time fiction writer told me,
give yourself six months to figure

00:39:14.910 --> 00:39:17.500
out the routine and how
you're actually doing it,

00:39:17.500 --> 00:39:20.350
because it might take that long
before you actually know what your

00:39:20.350 --> 00:39:22.970
day looks like, just
writing fiction every day.

00:39:22.970 --> 00:39:25.660
Like that's the big thing,
is just can I produce enough.

00:39:25.660 --> 00:39:27.670
So far, most of the time, yes.

00:39:27.670 --> 00:39:30.510
Like, you know, things happen.

00:39:30.510 --> 00:39:33.780
There's like a health emergency
in the family, and I have to,

00:39:33.780 --> 00:39:35.080
but that would happen anyway.

00:39:35.080 --> 00:39:37.960
So, so far it's, you
know, it's going okay,

00:39:37.960 --> 00:39:42.560
but it's definitely a thing where
I'm kind of dipping a toe in.

00:39:42.560 --> 00:39:45.030
I don't know.

00:39:45.030 --> 00:39:46.880
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:39:46.880 --> 00:39:48.180
&gt;&gt; Charlie Jane Anders: All right.

00:39:48.180 --> 00:39:49.480
&gt;&gt; Barrie Hardymon: Oh, sorry.

00:39:49.480 --> 00:39:50.780
I'm sorry, I didn't
know there was another.

00:39:50.780 --> 00:39:52.080
&gt;&gt; That's okay.

00:39:52.080 --> 00:39:53.770
My question is, well I
read Six Months Three Days.

00:39:53.770 --> 00:39:55.070
&gt;&gt; Charlie Jane Anders: Oh yeah?

00:39:55.070 --> 00:39:56.370
&gt;&gt; And I really loved it.

00:39:56.370 --> 00:39:57.670
&gt;&gt; Charlie Jane Anders:
Oh, thank you, yes.

00:39:57.670 --> 00:39:58.970
Oh, sorry.

00:39:58.970 --> 00:40:00.460
&gt;&gt; When I finished it I was
kind of mad that it wasn't much,

00:40:00.460 --> 00:40:05.920
much longer, like a whole novel
or something, but there was also,

00:40:05.920 --> 00:40:11.000
after I reflected on it, this like,
it felt like very purely distilled

00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:18.000
down to the entire story, like the
fewest details kind of, to tell it,

00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:19.780
and decided I liked that.

00:40:19.780 --> 00:40:21.080
&gt;&gt; Charlie Jane Anders: Oh good.

00:40:21.080 --> 00:40:25.750
&gt;&gt; But then reading All the Birds
in the Sky, I just wonder for you,

00:40:25.750 --> 00:40:30.850
what's the decision about whether
something is longer or shorter

00:40:30.850 --> 00:40:33.970
or is it just that you write it and
then that's the length that it is.

00:40:33.970 --> 00:40:37.990
Did you set out to
write this as a novel

00:40:37.990 --> 00:40:39.690
or was it originally a short story

00:40:39.690 --> 00:40:42.400
and it was just too big,
or how does that work.

00:40:42.400 --> 00:40:44.380
&gt;&gt; Charlie Jane Anders: Yeah, I
mean that's always a tough decision

00:40:44.380 --> 00:40:48.290
like whether something should
be a short story or a novel.

00:40:48.290 --> 00:40:50.980
You know, there was like a period
for a while, like a few years ago

00:40:50.980 --> 00:40:53.600
when I wrote a bunch of things
that I was like oh this is going

00:40:53.600 --> 00:40:55.410
to be a novel, and then
it became a short storey.

00:40:55.410 --> 00:40:57.590
That happened like over
and over again for a while,

00:40:57.590 --> 00:40:59.090
and I don't know why
that was happening,

00:40:59.090 --> 00:41:01.460
but I got some good
short stories out of it.

00:41:01.460 --> 00:41:04.380
I think Six Months, Three Days I
always thought was a short story,

00:41:04.380 --> 00:41:07.820
like maybe there was a minute
when I was like oh can I make this

00:41:07.820 --> 00:41:11.200 position:56%
that much longer, and I was like no,
because you have to pay off that,

00:41:11.200 --> 00:41:15.230
like, it's got to have like,
you got to pay off that thing

00:41:15.230 --> 00:41:19.180
in a reasonable amount of time, you
can't keep peddling or whatever.

00:41:19.180 --> 00:41:21.640
And like, yeah, so it was
just like that clearly had

00:41:21.640 --> 00:41:25.620
to be a short story, and with
All the Birds in the Sky,

00:41:25.620 --> 00:41:30.370 position:56%
I always thought of it as the novel,
I think just because the whole idea

00:41:30.370 --> 00:41:33.370
of the witch and the mad scientist
felt like something that had

00:41:33.370 --> 00:41:36.380
so much potential and so
many ways that it could go,

00:41:36.380 --> 00:41:39.280
and like then when I had this
idea of like oh, then were kids,

00:41:39.280 --> 00:41:41.510
and then there were adults,
that just felt like something

00:41:41.510 --> 00:41:45.000
that I was pretty sure I
could make into a novel.

00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:48.870
And like I know there are authors
who like get 100 pages into a novel

00:41:48.870 --> 00:41:51.280
and then just, they can't go any
further and they throw it away

00:41:51.280 --> 00:41:54.070
and they start over again, or
whatever, and that's never happened

00:41:54.070 --> 00:41:57.560
to me, but I have written a bunch
novels that never got published.

00:41:57.560 --> 00:42:01.650 position:56%
But, yeah, I feel like, I don't know
if I've gotten a better instinct.

00:42:01.650 --> 00:42:05.080
I feel like the thing, I wrote a
thing on IO9 about how can you tell

00:42:05.080 --> 00:42:06.970
if your novel is just an
overgrown short story,

00:42:06.970 --> 00:42:08.720
which is on there somewhere.

00:42:08.720 --> 00:42:12.750
I feel like the metric or the
decision tree is mostly just,

00:42:12.750 --> 00:42:17.340
you know, are there a lot of
kind of ramifications that I want

00:42:17.340 --> 00:42:21.720
to play out, are there a lot of
like extra kind of nooks and alleys

00:42:21.720 --> 00:42:25.050
that I want to look down that
are going to make this rewarding

00:42:25.050 --> 00:42:27.820
at that length, or
can I distill it down.

00:42:27.820 --> 00:42:31.060
I feel like if you can distill it
down you always kind of should.

00:42:31.060 --> 00:42:34.030
Like I feel like shorter is
always better, like, you know,

00:42:34.030 --> 00:42:36.400
never waste the reader's
time if you can avoid it,

00:42:36.400 --> 00:42:38.440
I guess, is always a good rule.

00:42:38.440 --> 00:42:40.320
&gt;&gt; Barrie Hardymon:
I'm sorry to tell you

00:42:40.320 --> 00:42:42.170
that we have to wrap this up.

00:42:42.170 --> 00:42:43.980
The book is All the
Birds in the Sky.

00:42:43.980 --> 00:42:45.780
This is Charlie Janes Anders.

00:42:45.780 --> 00:42:49.040
[ Applause ]

00:42:49.040 --> 00:42:50.800
&gt;&gt; Charlie Jane Anders:
That went really fast.

00:42:50.800 --> 00:42:52.100
&gt;&gt; Barrie Hardymon: I know, right.

00:42:52.100 --> 00:42:55.080
&gt;&gt; This has been a presentation
of the Library of Congress.
