so one of my recent columns in

00:00:07.030 --> 00:00:07.040
so one of my recent columns in
 

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:09.400
so one of my recent columns in
Scientific American is what was called

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:09.410
Scientific American is what was called
 

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:13.419
Scientific American is what was called
sky gods for skeptics or as I used to

00:00:13.419 --> 00:00:13.429
sky gods for skeptics or as I used to
 

00:00:13.429 --> 00:00:19.210
sky gods for skeptics or as I used to
call it a aliens for atheists basically

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:19.220
call it a aliens for atheists basically
 

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:22.900
call it a aliens for atheists basically
the idea is that aliens and

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:22.910
the idea is that aliens and
 

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:25.120
the idea is that aliens and
extraterrestrials in our imagination we

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:25.130
extraterrestrials in our imagination we
 

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:27.370
extraterrestrials in our imagination we
haven't found any yet so they're all in

00:00:27.370 --> 00:00:27.380
haven't found any yet so they're all in
 

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:31.299
haven't found any yet so they're all in
our imagination are often portrayed as

00:00:31.299 --> 00:00:31.309
our imagination are often portrayed as
 

00:00:31.309 --> 00:00:34.090
our imagination are often portrayed as
these almost godlike deities you know

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:34.100
these almost godlike deities you know
 

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:36.069
these almost godlike deities you know
they're super advanced technologically

00:00:36.069 --> 00:00:36.079
they're super advanced technologically
 

00:00:36.079 --> 00:00:38.590
they're super advanced technologically
scientifically morally you know they've

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:38.600
scientifically morally you know they've
 

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:41.560
scientifically morally you know they've
somehow overcome war and poverty and

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:41.570
somehow overcome war and poverty and
 

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:43.389
somehow overcome war and poverty and
these sorts of things and so I got to

00:00:43.389 --> 00:00:43.399
these sorts of things and so I got to
 

00:00:43.399 --> 00:00:44.650
these sorts of things and so I got to
thinking about this it's it's very

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:44.660
thinking about this it's it's very
 

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:46.660
thinking about this it's it's very
similar to the religious impulse which

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:46.670
similar to the religious impulse which
 

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:49.239
similar to the religious impulse which
is that we're not alone there is

00:00:49.239 --> 00:00:49.249
is that we're not alone there is
 

00:00:49.249 --> 00:00:52.060
is that we're not alone there is
something out there more powerful than

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:52.070
something out there more powerful than
 

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:54.910
something out there more powerful than
us who knows about us and cares about us

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:54.920
us who knows about us and cares about us
 

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:57.970
us who knows about us and cares about us
who loves us you know that's the kind of

00:00:57.970 --> 00:00:57.980
who loves us you know that's the kind of
 

00:00:57.980 --> 00:00:59.860
who loves us you know that's the kind of
deep religious impulse we're not alone

00:00:59.860 --> 00:00:59.870
deep religious impulse we're not alone
 

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:02.500
deep religious impulse we're not alone
and that's the same impulse people get

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:02.510
and that's the same impulse people get
 

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:04.570
and that's the same impulse people get
when they think about extraterrestrials

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:04.580
when they think about extraterrestrials
 

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:09.460
when they think about extraterrestrials
even so and the crux of my article in

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:09.470
even so and the crux of my article in
 

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:11.080
even so and the crux of my article in
Scientific American was there was a new

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:11.090
Scientific American was there was a new
 

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:13.810
Scientific American was there was a new
paper published that showed that people

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:13.820
paper published that showed that people
 

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:16.120
paper published that showed that people
that have this longing you know so

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:16.130
that have this longing you know so
 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:17.530
that have this longing you know so
there's variation in this some people

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:17.540
there's variation in this some people
 

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:18.880
there's variation in this some people
have more of that longing than others

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:18.890
have more of that longing than others
 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:21.370
have more of that longing than others
those that have that longing but are not

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:21.380
those that have that longing but are not
 

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:24.270
those that have that longing but are not
religious are more likely to believe

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:24.280
religious are more likely to believe
 

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:26.709
religious are more likely to believe
extraterrestrials are out there in other

00:01:26.709 --> 00:01:26.719
extraterrestrials are out there in other
 

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:28.179
extraterrestrials are out there in other
words if you have the religious beliefs

00:01:28.179 --> 00:01:28.189
words if you have the religious beliefs
 

00:01:28.189 --> 00:01:30.730
words if you have the religious beliefs
you know God Jesus mom and whatever is

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:30.740
you know God Jesus mom and whatever is
 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:33.520
you know God Jesus mom and whatever is
your religion is you don't really need

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:33.530
your religion is you don't really need
 

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:35.469
your religion is you don't really need
the alien so you're satisfied with that

00:01:35.469 --> 00:01:35.479
the alien so you're satisfied with that
 

00:01:35.479 --> 00:01:36.580
the alien so you're satisfied with that
but if you don't have that then you're

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:36.590
but if you don't have that then you're
 

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:38.260
but if you don't have that then you're
more likely to go for the

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:38.270
more likely to go for the
 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:40.330
more likely to go for the
extra-terrestrial hypothesis as a viable

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:40.340
extra-terrestrial hypothesis as a viable
 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:41.859
extra-terrestrial hypothesis as a viable
one in the sense that it makes me feel

00:01:41.859 --> 00:01:41.869
one in the sense that it makes me feel
 

00:01:41.869 --> 00:01:45.160
one in the sense that it makes me feel
good because let's face it religions

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:45.170
good because let's face it religions
 

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:46.779
good because let's face it religions
have no more evidence for God then

00:01:46.779 --> 00:01:46.789
have no more evidence for God then
 

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:48.609
have no more evidence for God then
scientists have for extraterrestrials

00:01:48.609 --> 00:01:48.619
scientists have for extraterrestrials
 

00:01:48.619 --> 00:01:51.459
scientists have for extraterrestrials
it's all imagination and speculation

00:01:51.459 --> 00:01:51.469
it's all imagination and speculation
 

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:53.980
it's all imagination and speculation
based on reason and logic and arguments

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:53.990
based on reason and logic and arguments
 

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:55.300
based on reason and logic and arguments
but we still have any empirical evidence

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:55.310
but we still have any empirical evidence
 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:57.639
but we still have any empirical evidence
so short of that I find it interesting

00:01:57.639 --> 00:01:57.649
so short of that I find it interesting
 

00:01:57.649 --> 00:02:00.520
so short of that I find it interesting
that that that it becomes sort of an

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:00.530
that that that it becomes sort of an
 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:03.849
that that that it becomes sort of an
emotional appeal or you know a deep

00:02:03.849 --> 00:02:03.859
emotional appeal or you know a deep
 

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:08.109
emotional appeal or you know a deep
desire for us to feel like there's

00:02:08.109 --> 00:02:08.119
desire for us to feel like there's
 

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:10.600
desire for us to feel like there's
somebody else out there and I'm not

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:10.610
somebody else out there and I'm not
 

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:13.090
somebody else out there and I'm not
alone and let's face it that does feel

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:13.100
alone and let's face it that does feel
 

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:15.440
alone and let's face it that does feel
good and there's nothing wrong with that

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:15.450
good and there's nothing wrong with that
 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:17.030
good and there's nothing wrong with that
but but we should always suspend

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:17.040
but but we should always suspend
 

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:18.650
but but we should always suspend
judgment until we actually have evidence

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:18.660
judgment until we actually have evidence
 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:21.080
judgment until we actually have evidence
for this we may be the only ones in the

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:21.090
for this we may be the only ones in the
 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:23.390
for this we may be the only ones in the
cosmos that are sentient beings and if

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:23.400
cosmos that are sentient beings and if
 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:26.600
cosmos that are sentient beings and if
so all the more reason we should care

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:26.610
so all the more reason we should care
 

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:28.759
so all the more reason we should care
for our world and each other because

00:02:28.759 --> 00:02:28.769
for our world and each other because
 

00:02:28.769 --> 00:02:31.920
for our world and each other because
that would mean this is it

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:31.930
that would mean this is it
 

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:35.720
that would mean this is it
