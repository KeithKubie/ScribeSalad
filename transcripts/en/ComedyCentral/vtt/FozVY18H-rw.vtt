00:00:02.853 --> 00:00:06.035
- Tell your mama, hey
tell your mama I said hi.

00:00:06.035 --> 00:00:07.785
Yeah I work with her.

00:00:08.822 --> 00:00:11.108
(knocking on door)

00:00:11.108 --> 00:00:14.627
- Oh, let's get this party started.

00:00:14.627 --> 00:00:15.877
My single bros.

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:19.713
I am a married dude, but now it is time

00:00:19.713 --> 00:00:23.073
for me to hang with my single bros.

00:00:23.073 --> 00:00:24.573
- What's up Jason?

00:00:25.448 --> 00:00:26.856
Yeah, you like that you little bitch?

00:00:26.856 --> 00:00:27.689
Huh?

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:29.061
Yeah, how's your mama's dick taste?

00:00:29.061 --> 00:00:30.450
Ha ha.

00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:31.893
- He's talkin' to an 11 year old.

00:00:31.893 --> 00:00:34.567
- That's awesome, fill me in,

00:00:34.567 --> 00:00:35.400
what did I miss?

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:36.350
What did I miss so far?

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:37.720
- Ah Jason, you didn't miss much.

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:40.401
I mean, we've just been
hangin' out, you know,

00:00:40.401 --> 00:00:42.382
oh Michael made some prank calls earlier.

00:00:42.382 --> 00:00:43.735
- Yeah I made this old lady cry.

00:00:43.735 --> 00:00:45.220
- You did?

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:46.053
You did?

00:00:46.053 --> 00:00:48.208
Ah I can't believe I missed it.

00:00:48.208 --> 00:00:50.983
Ah God, you guys are so much fun.

00:00:50.983 --> 00:00:53.387
It's like, you've got to
be my coolest friends.

00:00:53.387 --> 00:00:55.010
- We are your coolest friends, man

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:56.616
and you have missed out but tonight,

00:00:56.616 --> 00:00:58.301
miss out no more.

00:00:58.301 --> 00:00:59.960
We got that Pinot Grigio wine,

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:01.772
we got that brie for you

00:01:01.772 --> 00:01:03.945
and we got back episodes of The Bachelor,

00:01:03.945 --> 00:01:06.107
that's straight J Nash life.

00:01:06.107 --> 00:01:08.189
- Yes, yes, Pinot Grigio

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:10.842
and back episodes of The Bachelor,

00:01:10.842 --> 00:01:13.675
and I need to be home in one hour.

00:01:14.612 --> 00:01:16.112
Ohhh, pahhh, pohh,

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:18.270
so, guys night.

00:01:19.692 --> 00:01:21.953
- I guess you had fun, huh?

00:01:21.953 --> 00:01:24.155
What did you, what'd you guys get into?

00:01:24.155 --> 00:01:25.112
What'd you do?

00:01:25.112 --> 00:01:27.364
- We made two hilarious prank calls

00:01:27.364 --> 00:01:29.114
that were so funny.

00:01:29.114 --> 00:01:32.067
- Wow, J, I just, I
don't know if I can think

00:01:32.067 --> 00:01:33.874
of anything that sounds cooler to me

00:01:33.874 --> 00:01:37.546
than a bunch of bros, in their 30's,

00:01:37.546 --> 00:01:39.840
making prank phone calls.

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:40.860
- Well they were pretty funny.

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:43.407
You'll have to hear them to decide that.

00:01:43.407 --> 00:01:45.668
- Mmm, I doubt it.

00:01:45.668 --> 00:01:47.392
Listen, I've been dealing
with this all night,

00:01:47.392 --> 00:01:49.248
I've been trying to get Taylor into that

00:01:49.248 --> 00:01:51.195
Springing Daisies Academy, you know?

00:01:51.195 --> 00:01:53.749
And it's just impossible.

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:56.913
Do you know this guy, Arthur Ruthledge?

00:01:56.913 --> 00:01:58.011
- He's a black guy, right?

00:01:58.011 --> 00:01:58.844
- Yeah.

00:01:58.844 --> 00:02:01.788
- Yeah, well why don't
you let me handle that?

00:02:01.788 --> 00:02:04.027
- What, handle it?

00:02:04.027 --> 00:02:04.860
What are you gonna do?

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:06.156
How are you gonna handle it?

00:02:06.156 --> 00:02:08.235
- Ah, where'd I just come from?

00:02:08.235 --> 00:02:10.188
Hanging out with my two black friends.

00:02:10.188 --> 00:02:11.021
Huh?

00:02:11.021 --> 00:02:12.067
Black people love me.

00:02:12.067 --> 00:02:13.134
- Please, stop.

00:02:13.134 --> 00:02:15.281
- Oh I'm sorry, how many
black friends do you have?

00:02:15.281 --> 00:02:16.114
How many?

00:02:17.698 --> 00:02:20.080
- You know, you know my friends, right?

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:21.835
- How about, let's count them up.

00:02:21.835 --> 00:02:22.668
Go ahead.

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:25.504
- [Wife] Look, I just don't have ...

00:02:25.504 --> 00:02:27.027
- No, zero, you have zero.

00:02:27.027 --> 00:02:28.940
- You know, no, it's not
like, a choice I've made

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:31.440
but no, I don't have a black friend.

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:32.649
I don't have any.

00:02:32.649 --> 00:02:36.232
- So, don't hate the
game, hate the player.

00:02:38.298 --> 00:02:40.063
- No, that's not the saying,

00:02:40.063 --> 00:02:41.385
it's the other way around.

00:02:41.385 --> 00:02:42.598
- The other way?

00:02:42.598 --> 00:02:44.359
Don't hate the player, the game?

00:02:44.359 --> 00:02:45.769
Is that how it goes?

00:02:45.769 --> 00:02:49.200
- [Wife] Don't hate the
player, hate the game.

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:53.022
- Right, cause the game is
a bigger, it's much larger,

00:02:53.022 --> 00:02:54.868
sense, so that does make sense.

00:02:54.868 --> 00:02:56.182
You are correct.

00:02:56.182 --> 00:02:57.599
So don't do that.

00:03:00.065 --> 00:03:03.148
I'll handle it, black people lave me.

00:03:04.248 --> 00:03:05.366
(door knocking)

00:03:05.366 --> 00:03:08.290
- Arthur, thank you so
much for coming over.

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:09.410
Come on in.

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:11.104
- I have to say, I really
appreciate you reaching down.

00:03:11.104 --> 00:03:14.659
I don't get a lot of social
calls from the other dads.

00:03:14.659 --> 00:03:15.741
- Do you not have any friends?

00:03:15.741 --> 00:03:17.360
- That's something I think
we should save for later

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:19.132
in the conversation,
when we know each other

00:03:19.132 --> 00:03:19.991
a little better.

00:03:19.991 --> 00:03:20.968
- Yeah, once we get to know each other

00:03:20.968 --> 00:03:22.427
and you feel more comfortable.

00:03:22.427 --> 00:03:24.898
You know what, we're
gonna change that today.

00:03:24.898 --> 00:03:26.249
- I'm excited.

00:03:26.249 --> 00:03:27.356
- Well come on in.

00:03:27.356 --> 00:03:28.189
- All right.

00:03:28.189 --> 00:03:30.234
This is very nice.

00:03:30.234 --> 00:03:32.695
- Yeah, so uh, yeah, you know,

00:03:32.695 --> 00:03:33.881
we're thinking about maybe going to

00:03:33.881 --> 00:03:35.128
Springing Daisies next year.

00:03:35.128 --> 00:03:35.961
- It's a great school.

00:03:35.961 --> 00:03:37.628
- Yeah, I know your daughters go there.

00:03:37.628 --> 00:03:38.662
- Yes, yes.

00:03:38.662 --> 00:03:40.252
- Yeah, that's really great.

00:03:40.252 --> 00:03:42.013
Hey, you know what I
got down in the garage?

00:03:42.013 --> 00:03:42.846
- [Arthur] What's that?

00:03:42.846 --> 00:03:45.306
- I got like, a hundred
old copies of Barely Legal.

00:03:45.306 --> 00:03:48.287
- Oh, is that a, some
sort of law magazine?

00:03:48.287 --> 00:03:49.954
- No, no, it's uh...

00:03:51.955 --> 00:03:53.930
- It's not about things
that are almost laws?

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:55.252
- No.

00:03:55.252 --> 00:03:56.162
(chuckles)

00:03:56.162 --> 00:03:57.244
I'm gonna show em' to you,

00:03:57.244 --> 00:03:58.403
I'm gonna show you what it is.

00:03:58.403 --> 00:03:59.600
You're gonna be surprised.

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:00.688
(laughs)

00:04:00.688 --> 00:04:01.650
Come on, have a seat.

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:03.240
How about some video games, huh?

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:04.083
- Oh sure.

00:04:04.083 --> 00:04:05.105
- Yeah we sit in the kid's chair.

00:04:05.105 --> 00:04:06.544
Yeah, you fuckin' little piece of shit,

00:04:06.544 --> 00:04:08.413
take that fuckin' asshole.

00:04:08.413 --> 00:04:11.303
Yeah you little dick tease.

00:04:11.303 --> 00:04:14.234
Your mother's fuckin' dumb, that's all.

00:04:14.234 --> 00:04:15.086
I'm not dumb.

00:04:15.086 --> 00:04:18.029
They don't care, they're not real kids.

00:04:18.029 --> 00:04:19.577
They're on the Internet.

00:04:19.577 --> 00:04:20.994
It doesn't count.

00:04:22.393 --> 00:04:24.070
You're stupid, you're 11.

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:26.865
You're 11 years old, you know nothing.

00:04:26.865 --> 00:04:28.249
You know nothing about the world

00:04:28.249 --> 00:04:31.774
and you have to ask your
parents to do something.

00:04:31.774 --> 00:04:32.978
And you're dumb.

00:04:32.978 --> 00:04:35.911
You're dumb, and you're
probably gonna go nowhere.

00:04:35.911 --> 00:04:37.674
And people say this is
the best part of your life

00:04:37.674 --> 00:04:39.700
and really, it is

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:41.936
and look, and think about how bad it is.

00:04:41.936 --> 00:04:43.306
Say something nasty dude.

00:04:43.306 --> 00:04:44.167
- I'm not gonna...

00:04:44.167 --> 00:04:45.284
- Be mean to the 11 year olds.

00:04:45.284 --> 00:04:46.542
- That doesn't make any sense to do that.

00:04:46.542 --> 00:04:47.595
- No, it's fun.

00:04:47.595 --> 00:04:50.345
- They need positive role models.

00:04:51.396 --> 00:04:54.345
- Arthur, Arthur come here, come here.

00:04:54.345 --> 00:04:55.590
- I can come back when
you're off the phone.

00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:57.587
- No, no, no, no, I'm doing a prank call.

00:04:57.587 --> 00:04:59.043
Come here, come here, come
here, come here, shhhh.

00:04:59.043 --> 00:05:00.266
- But who are you calling?

00:05:00.266 --> 00:05:01.858
- I'm calling the pizza
place, I'm doing a prank call.

00:05:01.858 --> 00:05:02.765
- Why would you do that?

00:05:02.765 --> 00:05:04.081
- Hello?

00:05:04.081 --> 00:05:07.414
Hi, yes, hi, this is Sylvester Stallone.

00:05:08.378 --> 00:05:09.866
- But you're not Sylvester Stallone.

00:05:09.866 --> 00:05:13.906
- Hello, yeah, I would
like to order a pizza.

00:05:13.906 --> 00:05:17.414
Yeah, yeah, this is
really Sylvester Stallone.

00:05:17.414 --> 00:05:19.540
- This is an awful way to be
wasting that person's time.

00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:21.772
- Yeah, it was good to talk to you too.

00:05:21.772 --> 00:05:23.455
- Why would you, they're
gonna make a pizza.

00:05:23.455 --> 00:05:25.709
- Let me get a, let me get a.

00:05:25.709 --> 00:05:27.940
- Actually I'm hungry so if you...

00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:29.846
- Let me get a 16 inch pizza.

00:05:29.846 --> 00:05:30.946
- If you're ordering...

00:05:30.946 --> 00:05:32.115
- With mushrooms.

00:05:32.115 --> 00:05:34.109
- Yeah, mushrooms, half mushrooms.

00:05:34.109 --> 00:05:36.653
- No, I'm not, I'm not
really getting a pizza.

00:05:36.653 --> 00:05:37.777
I'm not really getting a pizza.

00:05:37.777 --> 00:05:39.932
- They're gonna make a pizza, I'll go get,

00:05:39.932 --> 00:05:40.957
I'll go pick it up.

00:05:40.957 --> 00:05:42.631
- Yeah, what's that?

00:05:42.631 --> 00:05:44.077
- You can't, this is awful.

00:05:44.077 --> 00:05:46.535
- So now he knows, you fucked it up.

00:05:46.535 --> 00:05:48.785
(sizzling)

00:05:50.937 --> 00:05:53.189
- Those steaks look really good.

00:05:53.189 --> 00:05:56.772
- You ever think about
leaving your family?

00:06:00.678 --> 00:06:03.897
- I think it's time that I go.

00:06:03.897 --> 00:06:05.564
- Yeah, probably so.

00:06:07.514 --> 00:06:09.758
- Nice to meet you, Jason.

00:06:09.758 --> 00:06:11.925
- Good to meet you Arthur.

00:06:13.625 --> 00:06:15.792
Well, that didn't go well.

00:06:18.609 --> 00:06:20.238
- Wait Jason, so you thought,

00:06:20.238 --> 00:06:21.932
just because Michael and I are such fun,

00:06:21.932 --> 00:06:23.375
that this random black dude that you met

00:06:23.375 --> 00:06:24.517
was also gonna be fun?

00:06:24.517 --> 00:06:25.726
- Yeah, I just assumed

00:06:25.726 --> 00:06:27.440
that he would be the same way, I guess.

00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:28.675
- Cause we're all fun?

00:06:28.675 --> 00:06:30.055
- Yeah, you guys are fun.

00:06:30.055 --> 00:06:31.741
Aren't all black people fun?

00:06:31.741 --> 00:06:33.312
- We're not oompa loompas,
man, that's racist.

00:06:33.312 --> 00:06:36.042
- It's not racist, it's a positive thing.

00:06:36.042 --> 00:06:37.640
I feel positively.

00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:39.652
- Yeah, well it spit in
your face, didn't it?

00:06:39.652 --> 00:06:40.779
And I hate to break it to you,

00:06:40.779 --> 00:06:42.296
but most black people are boring.

00:06:42.296 --> 00:06:43.713
- [Jason] Really?

00:06:44.630 --> 00:06:45.524
- Yeah.

00:06:45.524 --> 00:06:47.054
- You know my cousin,
he's a black dude, right?

00:06:47.054 --> 00:06:48.744
All he does is spend his
Friday nights sittin' at home

00:06:48.744 --> 00:06:51.022
watching Sex in the City reruns.

00:06:51.022 --> 00:06:54.020
And building up his
character on Second Life.

00:06:54.020 --> 00:06:56.127
- Jason, most of the black kids
I went to high school with,

00:06:56.127 --> 00:06:57.095
they're into Will Smith now.

00:06:57.095 --> 00:06:59.595
And not his movies, his music.

00:07:00.676 --> 00:07:02.283
- That's terrible.

00:07:02.283 --> 00:07:04.025
- [Michael] Yeah.

00:07:04.025 --> 00:07:04.910
I mean, this is the guy,

00:07:04.910 --> 00:07:07.267
this is the guy that was gonna
get my kid into the school

00:07:07.267 --> 00:07:08.703
and I blew it.

00:07:08.703 --> 00:07:10.279
- Well listen, take Michael and I

00:07:10.279 --> 00:07:11.487
and we'll go talk to him with you.

00:07:11.487 --> 00:07:12.320
- Yeah.

00:07:12.320 --> 00:07:13.153
- What?

00:07:14.073 --> 00:07:16.826
Take my two black friends
and go over to see

00:07:16.826 --> 00:07:18.215
the other black guy that I know?

00:07:18.215 --> 00:07:19.247
- Yes.

00:07:19.247 --> 00:07:20.080
- And do what?

00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:20.913
- Talk.

00:07:24.842 --> 00:07:25.930
- You'd do that for me?

00:07:25.930 --> 00:07:26.763
- Yeah.

00:07:26.763 --> 00:07:27.596
- Of course.

00:07:27.596 --> 00:07:28.679
- Is that him right there?

00:07:28.679 --> 00:07:29.790
- Yeah.

00:07:29.790 --> 00:07:32.873
- Don't worry, we'll take care of it.

00:07:36.292 --> 00:07:37.875
- Junk, junk, junk.

00:07:44.184 --> 00:07:46.552
- Arthur, it's Jason Nash,

00:07:46.552 --> 00:07:47.614
- Jason fuckin' Nash,

00:07:47.614 --> 00:07:48.447
- Yeah.

00:07:48.447 --> 00:07:49.301
- What's wrong with you, huh?

00:07:49.301 --> 00:07:50.421
- What's happening?

00:07:50.421 --> 00:07:51.494
- Let his kid in your school.

00:07:51.494 --> 00:07:52.631
- [Arthur] I don't have much control.

00:07:52.631 --> 00:07:54.050
- Hit him, hit him.

00:07:54.050 --> 00:07:55.437
- Ahhhh, yeah.

00:07:55.437 --> 00:07:57.299
So break, break.

00:07:57.299 --> 00:07:58.630
- [Jason] Guys, don't do that.

00:07:58.630 --> 00:08:00.652
- Break out this..

00:08:00.652 --> 00:08:01.663
- [Jason] What are you doin?

00:08:01.663 --> 00:08:02.547
Why are you takin' your pants off?

00:08:02.547 --> 00:08:03.936
Why are you takin' your pants off?

00:08:03.936 --> 00:08:04.769
- I thought you said.

00:08:04.769 --> 00:08:06.195
- No, no, just talk to him.

00:08:06.195 --> 00:08:07.442
Arthur, please don't
tell anyone about this.

00:08:07.442 --> 00:08:08.350
This never happened, please, please.

00:08:08.350 --> 00:08:10.169
- I'm gonna tweet this,

00:08:10.169 --> 00:08:11.669
