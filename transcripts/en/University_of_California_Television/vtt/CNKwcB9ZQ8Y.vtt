00:00:01.290 --> 00:00:02.620
- [Announcer] This program is presented

00:00:02.620 --> 00:00:05.240
by University of California Television.

00:00:21.215 --> 00:00:23.882
(gentle music)

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:54.553
- Good afternoon everyone, and welcome.

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:58.410
I'm Mary Comerio, professor
of the Graduate School

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:01.410
and Chair of the Hitchcock
Professorship Committee.

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:05.110
We are pleased, along
with the Graduate Council,

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:08.050
to present Steven Pinker,
this year's speaker

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:12.160
in the Charles M and Martha
Hitchcock Lecture series.

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:15.290
As a condition of this
bequest we are obligated

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:18.050
and happy to tell you how the endowment

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:19.740
came to UC Berkeley.

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:22.540
It is a story that
exemplifies the many ways

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:25.240
the campus is linked to
the history of California

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:26.900
and to the Bay Area.

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:31.320
Dr. Charles Hitchcock, a
physician from the Army,

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:34.010
came to San Francisco
during the Gold Rush,

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:36.440
where he opened a thriving practice.

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:41.040
In 1885 Charles established a
professorship here at Berkeley

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:45.270
as an expression of his
long-held interest in education.

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:48.400
His daughter, Lillie Hitchcock Coit,

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:50.170
still treasured in San Francisco

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:54.110
for her colorful personality
as well as her generosity,

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:56.890
greatly expanded her
father's original gift

00:01:56.890 --> 00:01:59.870
to establish a professorship
at UC Berkeley.

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:04.030
Making it possible for us to
present a series of lectures.

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:06.100
The Hitchcock Fund has become

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:08.070
one of the most cherished endowments

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:10.200
of the University of California,

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:12.350
recognizing the highest distinction

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:14.840
of scholarly thought and achievement.

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:16.740
Thank you, Lillie and Charles.

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:19.930
And now a few words about Steven Pinker.

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:22.840
Steven Pinker is an
experimental psychologist

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:25.920
and one of the world's
foremost writers on language,

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:27.800
mind, and human nature.

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:30.160
He is well known for his contributions

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:32.640
to the field of evolutionary psychology

00:02:33.474 --> 00:02:35.750
and computational theory of mind.

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:38.570
Pinker has conducted
extensive experimental

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:41.750
and theoretical research
on the acquisition,

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:46.110
processing, history, and
neural basis of language.

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:48.600
Pinker has also conducted research

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:50.910
in the field of visual cognition,

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:53.870
investigating phenomena
such as the mind's ability

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:56.780
to imagine shapes and recognize faces.

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:00.060
His most recent research
investigates the phenomena

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:04.080
of common knowledge and how
it can explain cooperation,

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:07.600
nonverbal communication,
innuendo, euphemism,

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:10.320
and other forms of indirect speech.

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:14.370
Pinker's 2011 book, The
Better Angels of Our Nature,

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:18.750
you see that title here,
Why Violence Has Declined,

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:22.180
advances the bold thesis
that violence as a whole

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:25.060
has declined over the
course of world history.

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:27.870
Drawing from a wide
range of empirical data,

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:31.270
Pinker argues that a
combination of historical forces

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:33.310
has shifted the psychological balance

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:35.350
between motives for violence,

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:38.920
such as exploitation, revenge,
dominance, and sadism,

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:41.440
and motives for avoiding violence,

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:46.440
particularly empathy, self-control,
moral norms, and reason.

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:49.210
Pinker's publications
range from highly technical

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:51.410
academic works to book-length projects

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:53.060
for the general public.

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:56.550
In 1994 he published
The Language Instinct,

00:03:56.550 --> 00:03:59.020
a comprehensive account of language

00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:04.020
that uncovers its workings
in a biological adaption.

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:07.190
His 1997 book, How the Mind Works,

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:09.320
expands the scope of the first work

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:12.060
to include vision, reasoning, emotions,

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:15.520
social relationship,
and our response to art.

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:18.480
He has since authored
three additional books,

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:21.400
The Blank Slate, The Stuff of Thought,

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:23.580
and The Better Angels of Our Nature.

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:25.510
In addition to his academic work

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:28.670
he is a frequent contributor
to the New Republic,

00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:31.560
the New York Times, and Time magazine.

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:33.910
Pinker holds the title of Johnstone Family

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:37.100
Professor of Psychology
at Harvard University.

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:39.760
A long-standing resident
of Cambridge and Boston,

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:43.380
he received his PhD from Harvard in 1976,

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:47.440
and since then he has held
positions at both Harvard and MIT

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:50.580
with brief appointments at
Stanford and sabbatical visits

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:53.300
to University of California Santa Barbara.

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:55.650
His work has received numerous prizes,

00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:58.070
from the National Academy of Sciences,

00:04:58.070 --> 00:05:00.630
the Royal Institution of Great Britain,

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:03.600
the Cognitive Neuroscience Society,

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:06.300
and the American
Psychological Association.

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:09.010
He holds seven honorary doctorates

00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:12.710
and was named the 2006
Humanist of the Year

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:15.260
by the American Humanist Association.

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:18.618
Please join me in welcoming Steven Pinker.

00:05:18.618 --> 00:05:21.785
(audience applauding)

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:27.140
- Thank you, Mary, thanks
to all of you for coming.

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:32.370
Believe it or not, and I
know most people do not,

00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:35.940
violence has been in decline
for long stretches of time,

00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:38.920
and we may be living in
the most peaceful era

00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:41.220
in our species' existence.

00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:44.120
The decline of violence
has not been steady.

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:47.220
It has not brought rates
of violence down to zero.

00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:49.810
And it is not guaranteed to continue.

00:05:49.810 --> 00:05:51.460
But I hope to persuade you

00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:54.890
that it is a persistent
historical development,

00:05:54.890 --> 00:05:58.410
visible on scales from millennia to years,

00:05:58.410 --> 00:06:00.040
from wars and genocides

00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:02.720
to the treatment of children and animals.

00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:04.554
I'm gonna walk you through

00:06:04.554 --> 00:06:07.530
six major historical declines of violence.

00:06:07.530 --> 00:06:10.000
First, try to identify
their immediate causes,

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:13.080
that is particular
historical events of the era,

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:14.990
and then try to tie them together

00:06:14.990 --> 00:06:16.950
in terms of their ultimate causes,

00:06:16.950 --> 00:06:19.470
namely general historical forces

00:06:19.470 --> 00:06:21.263
interacting with human nature.

00:06:22.870 --> 00:06:24.410
The first decline of violence

00:06:24.410 --> 00:06:27.520
I call the pacification process.

00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:29.690
Until about 6,000 years ago

00:06:29.690 --> 00:06:31.900
humans everywhere lived in anarchy,

00:06:31.900 --> 00:06:33.680
without central government.

00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:36.960
What was life like in
this state of nature?

00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:39.130
This is a question that
thinkers have pondered

00:06:39.130 --> 00:06:40.583
for hundreds of years.

00:06:41.731 --> 00:06:44.360
In 1651 Thomas Hobbes famously wrote

00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:47.730
that in a state of nature the life of man

00:06:47.730 --> 00:06:52.447
is "solitary, poor, nasty,
brutish, and short."

00:06:53.676 --> 00:06:56.440
A century later, Jean-Jacques
Rousseau countered

00:06:56.440 --> 00:06:58.439
that "Nothing could be more gentle

00:06:58.439 --> 00:06:59.770
"than man in his primitive state."

00:06:59.770 --> 00:07:00.930
Now both of these gentlemen

00:07:00.930 --> 00:07:02.700
were speculating from the armchair,

00:07:02.700 --> 00:07:05.500
neither of them had any
idea what life was like

00:07:05.500 --> 00:07:06.790
in a state of anarchy.

00:07:06.790 --> 00:07:08.200
But today we can do better

00:07:08.200 --> 00:07:10.630
because there are two sources of evidence

00:07:10.630 --> 00:07:15.350
on rates of violent death
in non-state societies.

00:07:15.350 --> 00:07:17.460
The first is forensic archeology.

00:07:17.460 --> 00:07:20.930
You can think of this as CSI: Paleolithic.

00:07:20.930 --> 00:07:23.570
Namely, what proportion
of prehistoric skeletons

00:07:23.570 --> 00:07:26.140
have signs of violent trauma,

00:07:26.140 --> 00:07:31.000
such as bashed in skulls, decapitations,

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.410
bones with arrowheads embedded in them,

00:07:33.410 --> 00:07:35.993
or mummies found with
ropes around their necks.

00:07:37.456 --> 00:07:41.400
I've assembled here a list
of 20 of these estimates,

00:07:41.400 --> 00:07:46.380
plotted in terms of percentage
of deaths due to warfare.

00:07:46.380 --> 00:07:51.300
They span quite a range but
they average out to be 15%.

00:07:51.300 --> 00:07:55.350
15% of skeletons in these samples

00:07:55.350 --> 00:07:57.363
show signs of violent trauma.

00:07:58.720 --> 00:08:01.060
Is 15% a big number or a small number?

00:08:01.060 --> 00:08:03.980
Well let's compare it to
some comparable figures

00:08:03.980 --> 00:08:05.523
from modern eras.

00:08:06.410 --> 00:08:11.210
Here we have the rate of
death from war in Europe

00:08:11.210 --> 00:08:13.864
and the United States in the 20th century,

00:08:13.864 --> 00:08:15.610
including all of the deaths
from both World Wars,

00:08:15.610 --> 00:08:18.583
which comes out to be 2/3 of 1%.

00:08:19.610 --> 00:08:23.410
If you try to get the
upper bounded estimate,

00:08:23.410 --> 00:08:26.610
the largest plausible estimate
of the number of people

00:08:26.610 --> 00:08:29.360
who died in the 20th century from wars,

00:08:29.360 --> 00:08:31.530
genocides, and man-made famines,

00:08:31.530 --> 00:08:34.390
you can push the figure up to about 3%.

00:08:34.390 --> 00:08:37.670
And here is the figure for
the world in the 21st century.

00:08:37.670 --> 00:08:41.510
The bar is invisible because
it is less than one pixel high,

00:08:41.510 --> 00:08:44.450
with a rate of 3/100 of 1%.

00:08:45.600 --> 00:08:48.680
The second source of
evidence on rates of violence

00:08:48.680 --> 00:08:50.010
in non-state societies

00:08:50.010 --> 00:08:52.870
comes from ethnographic vital statistics.

00:08:52.870 --> 00:08:56.790
Now the wave of settlement and government

00:08:56.790 --> 00:09:00.260
that swept over the world
starting around 6,000 years ago

00:09:00.260 --> 00:09:03.720
left a few pockets of the world
still in a state of anarchy,

00:09:03.720 --> 00:09:06.790
namely hunter-gatherer,
hunter-horticulturalist,

00:09:06.790 --> 00:09:08.760
and other tribal societies.

00:09:08.760 --> 00:09:11.030
And ethnographers who have lived with them

00:09:11.030 --> 00:09:12.780
for long stretches of time

00:09:12.780 --> 00:09:15.020
have recorded their vital statistics,

00:09:15.020 --> 00:09:19.330
including causes of death,
including death by warfare

00:09:19.330 --> 00:09:21.400
and other forms of violence.

00:09:21.400 --> 00:09:24.970
I've found in the literature
27 of these estimates,

00:09:24.970 --> 00:09:27.870
and once again they span quite a range.

00:09:27.870 --> 00:09:30.650
They average out to be a little more than

00:09:30.650 --> 00:09:33.090
500 per hundred thousand per year,

00:09:33.090 --> 00:09:37.220
that is every year about
1/2 of 1% of the population

00:09:37.220 --> 00:09:39.160
dies in warfare.

00:09:39.160 --> 00:09:41.910
Again, is that a big
number or a small number?

00:09:41.910 --> 00:09:45.770
Let me put it into perspective
by citing some modern figures

00:09:45.770 --> 00:09:48.050
and stack the deck against modernity

00:09:48.050 --> 00:09:51.060
by picking some of the
most violent countries

00:09:51.060 --> 00:09:53.260
in their most violent periods.

00:09:53.260 --> 00:09:56.700
Like Germany in the 20th
century, with its two World Wars,

00:09:56.700 --> 00:09:59.020
which comes out to a rate of 144

00:09:59.020 --> 00:10:00.520
per hundred thousand per year.

00:10:01.440 --> 00:10:04.550
Russia in the 20th century,
two World Wars and a civil war

00:10:04.550 --> 00:10:06.970
with a rate of 135.

00:10:06.970 --> 00:10:10.070
Japan in the 20th century,
which underwent a World War

00:10:10.070 --> 00:10:14.060
that ended in two nuclear
strikes, with a rate of 27.

00:10:14.060 --> 00:10:15.950
United States in the 20th century,

00:10:15.950 --> 00:10:18.520
which fought two World
Wars and half a dozen

00:10:18.520 --> 00:10:20.673
other foreign wars, with a rate of 2.7.

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:25.840
Again if we try to get
the highest plausible rate

00:10:25.840 --> 00:10:27.970
for the world as a whole
in the 20th century,

00:10:27.970 --> 00:10:29.730
throwing in not just the war deaths

00:10:29.730 --> 00:10:33.270
but the deaths from
genocide, man-made famines,

00:10:33.270 --> 00:10:36.840
and indirect deaths from
starvation and disease

00:10:36.840 --> 00:10:40.413
in the wake of war we
get a rate of about 60.

00:10:41.860 --> 00:10:45.010
And here is the figure for
the world in the 21st century.

00:10:45.010 --> 00:10:48.210
Again the bar is less than one pixel high.

00:10:48.210 --> 00:10:50.210
So not to put too fine a point on it,

00:10:50.210 --> 00:10:54.990
but when it comes to violence
in a state of nature,

00:10:54.990 --> 00:10:57.173
Hobbes was right, Rousseau was wrong.

00:10:58.340 --> 00:11:02.160
The immediate cause was the
rise and expansion of states

00:11:02.160 --> 00:11:05.010
and empires, leading to the various paxes

00:11:05.010 --> 00:11:06.490
that history students read about.

00:11:06.490 --> 00:11:10.433
The Pax Romana, Pax Islamica,
Pax Hispanica, and so on.

00:11:11.610 --> 00:11:16.150
The immediate cause is that
tribal raiding and feuding

00:11:16.150 --> 00:11:20.410
are a nuisance to imperial overlords.

00:11:20.410 --> 00:11:22.850
Not that they have a benevolent interest

00:11:22.850 --> 00:11:24.450
in the welfare of their citizens,

00:11:24.450 --> 00:11:26.630
but they would just as
soon keep them alive

00:11:26.630 --> 00:11:30.450
to supply them with taxes
and soldiers and slaves.

00:11:30.450 --> 00:11:32.810
So just as a farmer has a selfish interest

00:11:32.810 --> 00:11:35.330
in preventing his livestock
from killing each other,

00:11:35.330 --> 00:11:37.120
he doesn't really care
what they're fighting about

00:11:37.120 --> 00:11:38.800
and it's just a dead loss to him,

00:11:38.800 --> 00:11:41.277
so the first kings and emperors

00:11:41.277 --> 00:11:44.643
tried to pacify the territories
that they conquered.

00:11:45.670 --> 00:11:49.240
Now the second decline of
violence can be appreciated

00:11:49.240 --> 00:11:51.910
by considering this woodcut,

00:11:51.910 --> 00:11:54.560
showing a typical day in
the life in the Middle Ages.

00:11:55.490 --> 00:11:57.870
And the process that brought
this mayhem under control

00:11:57.870 --> 00:12:00.560
has been called the civilizing process.

00:12:00.560 --> 00:12:03.520
Turns out that in many parts
of Europe data on homicide

00:12:03.520 --> 00:12:06.170
go back literally 800 years.

00:12:06.170 --> 00:12:10.090
And historical criminologists
have plotted them over time

00:12:10.090 --> 00:12:11.330
when they have found them.

00:12:11.330 --> 00:12:16.030
This is a set of homicide
estimates from the year 1200

00:12:16.030 --> 00:12:17.170
to the year 2000,

00:12:17.170 --> 00:12:20.470
once again plotted in
terms of number of deaths

00:12:20.470 --> 00:12:22.520
per hundred thousand per year.

00:12:22.520 --> 00:12:24.440
In this case the scale is logarithmic,

00:12:24.440 --> 00:12:27.020
from a tenth of a homicide
per hundred thousand per year,

00:12:27.020 --> 00:12:29.300
to one to 10 to a 100.

00:12:29.300 --> 00:12:32.384
And as you can see there's
been a massive decline

00:12:32.384 --> 00:12:33.950
in the rate of homicide in England.

00:12:33.950 --> 00:12:37.370
So that a contemporary Englishman
has about 1/35 the chance

00:12:37.370 --> 00:12:41.040
of being murdered as
his medieval ancestors.

00:12:41.040 --> 00:12:44.270
This is true not just in
England but in every country

00:12:44.270 --> 00:12:45.800
for which data are available.

00:12:45.800 --> 00:12:49.120
Here we have comparable data
for Germany and Switzerland,

00:12:49.120 --> 00:12:52.810
Netherlands, Italy, and Scandinavia.

00:12:52.810 --> 00:12:56.760
Here I've averaged those five
regions in Western Europe

00:12:56.760 --> 00:12:59.210
and for the sake of
comparison have also included

00:12:59.210 --> 00:13:02.320
that 524 per hundred
thousand per year figure

00:13:02.320 --> 00:13:04.760
from the average of non-state societies.

00:13:04.760 --> 00:13:07.020
So this gap is pretty much what I call

00:13:07.020 --> 00:13:08.700
the pacification process.

00:13:08.700 --> 00:13:12.760
And this further decline
the civilizing process.

00:13:12.760 --> 00:13:16.140
I borrowed the term from a classic book

00:13:16.140 --> 00:13:18.820
by the German sociologist Norbert Elias,

00:13:18.820 --> 00:13:21.710
who argued that in the
transition from the Middle Ages

00:13:21.710 --> 00:13:25.350
to modernity there was a
consolidation of central states

00:13:25.350 --> 00:13:28.350
and kingdoms out of the patchwork quilt

00:13:28.350 --> 00:13:31.480
of duchies and baronies and principalities

00:13:31.480 --> 00:13:34.420
that had polka-dotted Europe.

00:13:34.420 --> 00:13:36.910
With it criminal justice was nationalized,

00:13:36.910 --> 00:13:40.010
and the constant feuding and
brigandage and war lording

00:13:40.010 --> 00:13:42.340
of medieval knights gradually gave way

00:13:42.340 --> 00:13:44.340
to the King's justice.

00:13:44.340 --> 00:13:45.280
Also during this era

00:13:45.280 --> 00:13:47.900
there was a growing
infrastructure of commerce.

00:13:47.900 --> 00:13:52.490
There were financial instruments
like money and contracts

00:13:52.490 --> 00:13:54.580
that could be recognized
within the boundaries

00:13:54.580 --> 00:13:56.670
of the newly consolidated states.

00:13:56.670 --> 00:13:59.720
And there were physical
improvements to the infrastructure

00:13:59.720 --> 00:14:02.050
of trade such as better roads and carts

00:14:02.050 --> 00:14:04.140
and instruments of timekeeping.

00:14:04.140 --> 00:14:07.260
As a result, Elias
argued, zero-sum plunder

00:14:07.260 --> 00:14:09.830
began to give way to positive-sum trade.

00:14:09.830 --> 00:14:12.590
And that's an idea that I'll return to

00:14:12.590 --> 00:14:15.090
at the end of the talk as
I try to wrap things up.

00:14:16.090 --> 00:14:18.360
The third decline of
violence can be appreciated

00:14:18.360 --> 00:14:21.130
by recalling some of the
ways that the early kings

00:14:21.130 --> 00:14:24.420
and emperors kept law and
order within their borders.

00:14:24.420 --> 00:14:28.570
Namely sadistic forms of
corporal and capital punishment

00:14:28.570 --> 00:14:32.430
such as breaking on the
wheel, burning at the stake,

00:14:32.430 --> 00:14:37.430
clawing with iron hooks,
sawing in half, and impalement.

00:14:37.810 --> 00:14:40.331
But in a development that's been called

00:14:40.331 --> 00:14:42.590
the Humanitarian Revolution,
region after region

00:14:42.590 --> 00:14:46.520
abolished these forms
of sadistic punishment.

00:14:46.520 --> 00:14:51.520
Here we have a timeline
of countries or empires

00:14:51.680 --> 00:14:55.833
that abolished torture as a
form of capital punishment.

00:14:56.700 --> 00:15:01.030
Including our own country in
the famous Eighth Amendment

00:15:01.030 --> 00:15:03.890
prohibition of cruel
and unusual punishment,

00:15:03.890 --> 00:15:06.110
which occurred in the
midst of this process,

00:15:06.110 --> 00:15:09.873
concentrated in the second
half of the 18th century.

00:15:11.230 --> 00:15:13.960
A process that in part has been documented

00:15:13.960 --> 00:15:16.049
by the historian Lynn Hunt,

00:15:16.049 --> 00:15:18.170
who I believe is here at Berkeley.

00:15:18.170 --> 00:15:21.070
Also abolished during this
period was the profligate use

00:15:21.070 --> 00:15:24.350
of the death penalty
for non-lethal crimes.

00:15:24.350 --> 00:15:28.140
In 18th century England there
were 222 capital offenses

00:15:28.140 --> 00:15:31.390
on the books, including
poaching, counterfeiting,

00:15:31.390 --> 00:15:35.130
robbing a rabbit warren, being
in the company of gypsies,

00:15:35.130 --> 00:15:37.747
and "strong evidence of malice in a child

00:15:37.747 --> 00:15:40.430
"seven to 14 years of age."

00:15:40.430 --> 00:15:43.160
By 1861 the number of
capital crimes in England

00:15:43.160 --> 00:15:44.410
had been reduced to four.

00:15:45.490 --> 00:15:49.950
Similarly in 17th and
18th century United States

00:15:49.950 --> 00:15:52.720
the death penalty was prescribed and used

00:15:52.720 --> 00:15:55.230
for theft, sodomy, bestiality, adultery,

00:15:55.230 --> 00:15:57.570
witchcraft, concealing
birth, slave revolt,

00:15:57.570 --> 00:15:58.940
and counterfeiting.

00:15:58.940 --> 00:16:03.120
There are in this country
capital punishment geeks

00:16:04.510 --> 00:16:07.820
who keep databases of every execution

00:16:07.820 --> 00:16:10.650
that has ever taken place
in the United States,

00:16:10.650 --> 00:16:14.250
including the colonies prior to 1776.

00:16:14.250 --> 00:16:16.509
I've taken one of their data sets

00:16:16.509 --> 00:16:18.570
and plotted the percentage of executions

00:16:18.570 --> 00:16:21.740
in the United States for
crimes other than murder

00:16:21.740 --> 00:16:24.160
from 1650 to 2000.

00:16:24.160 --> 00:16:26.630
As you can see in the colonial period,

00:16:26.630 --> 00:16:28.540
and the early days of the Republic,

00:16:28.540 --> 00:16:32.110
a majority of executions were
for crimes other than murder.

00:16:32.110 --> 00:16:35.770
Now the only crime punished
by death other than murder

00:16:35.770 --> 00:16:37.683
is conspiracy to commit murder.

00:16:38.700 --> 00:16:41.360
Now the death penalty itself
of course has been abolished

00:16:41.360 --> 00:16:45.450
in every Western democracy
but the United States.

00:16:45.450 --> 00:16:49.250
Here we have a timeline
of the European countries

00:16:49.250 --> 00:16:51.770
with capital punishment on the books.

00:16:51.770 --> 00:16:53.030
Now most of the abolitions

00:16:53.030 --> 00:16:55.070
were actually in the 20th century,

00:16:55.070 --> 00:16:56.790
but if you look at the blue timeline

00:16:56.790 --> 00:16:58.480
it shows the number of European countries

00:16:58.480 --> 00:17:01.930
that actually de facto
carried out executions.

00:17:01.930 --> 00:17:05.160
Showing that well before
European politicians

00:17:05.160 --> 00:17:08.750
got around to striking capital
punishment from the law books

00:17:08.750 --> 00:17:11.010
their countrymen had pretty
much lost their taste

00:17:11.010 --> 00:17:12.310
for putting people to death.

00:17:12.310 --> 00:17:15.000
And on average 50 years elapsed

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:18.690
between the last actual
execution in a European country

00:17:18.690 --> 00:17:20.930
and the formal abolition.

00:17:20.930 --> 00:17:22.710
Now I mentioned that the United States

00:17:22.710 --> 00:17:26.260
is a notorious exception,
or more accurately,

00:17:26.260 --> 00:17:29.650
32 of the 50 states are exceptions.

00:17:29.650 --> 00:17:32.110
Because the general trend
in the United States

00:17:32.110 --> 00:17:35.610
is for state after state to
abolish capital punishment.

00:17:35.610 --> 00:17:38.500
Over the course of writing Better Angels

00:17:38.500 --> 00:17:40.980
I had to revise the
number of American states

00:17:40.980 --> 00:17:43.120
that have capital punishment three times

00:17:43.120 --> 00:17:46.710
because of abolitions just
in the last five years.

00:17:46.710 --> 00:17:49.050
But even putting aside
the number of states

00:17:49.050 --> 00:17:52.060
that have capital punishment,

00:17:52.060 --> 00:17:54.630
the number of people who
are actually executed

00:17:54.630 --> 00:17:57.080
has been in precipitous decline.

00:17:57.080 --> 00:18:00.790
Again this graph goes from
1625 to the year 2000,

00:18:00.790 --> 00:18:03.870
showing the number of American
executions per capita.

00:18:03.870 --> 00:18:06.870
For all its notoriety
every year in this country

00:18:06.870 --> 00:18:09.610
about 40 people are put
to death in a country

00:18:09.610 --> 00:18:12.793
that has more than 16,000
homicides every year.

00:18:14.040 --> 00:18:16.450
Also abolished during the
Humanitarian Revolution

00:18:16.450 --> 00:18:18.850
were witch hunts, religious persecution,

00:18:18.850 --> 00:18:22.440
such as burning heretics,
dueling among men of honor,

00:18:22.440 --> 00:18:25.460
blood sports like bear
baiting, debtors' prisons,

00:18:25.460 --> 00:18:28.010
and most famously of all, slavery.

00:18:28.010 --> 00:18:31.410
Slavery used to be legal
everywhere on earth.

00:18:31.410 --> 00:18:33.035
No one seemed to think

00:18:33.035 --> 00:18:34.210
there's anything
particularly wrong with it.

00:18:34.210 --> 00:18:36.540
The Bible had no problem with slavery.

00:18:36.540 --> 00:18:40.200
So-called democratic Athens
was a slaveholding society.

00:18:40.200 --> 00:18:44.220
But beginning with the second
half of the 18th century

00:18:44.220 --> 00:18:47.950
there was a trickle of
abolitions that grew into a flood

00:18:47.950 --> 00:18:51.113
that eventually encompassed
the entire world.

00:18:52.220 --> 00:18:57.030
Culminating in 1962 when
Saudi Arabia and Yemen

00:18:57.030 --> 00:18:59.560
abolished slavery, and finally 1980,

00:18:59.560 --> 00:19:02.190
Mauritania became the
last country on earth

00:19:02.190 --> 00:19:04.860
to allow slavery as a legal institution.

00:19:04.860 --> 00:19:06.310
So for the last three decades

00:19:06.310 --> 00:19:08.370
we've been living in
an unprecedented period

00:19:08.370 --> 00:19:11.120
in human history in which
slavery has been illegal

00:19:11.120 --> 00:19:13.110
everywhere on earth.

00:19:13.110 --> 00:19:14.510
What were the immediate causes

00:19:14.510 --> 00:19:16.860
of the Humanitarian Revolution?

00:19:16.860 --> 00:19:19.800
Well a plausible hypothesis is affluence.

00:19:19.800 --> 00:19:23.410
Perhaps as people's lives
become more pleasant,

00:19:23.410 --> 00:19:26.413
thanks to the advances in technology,

00:19:27.550 --> 00:19:30.130
people put a higher
value on their own lives

00:19:30.130 --> 00:19:33.240
and by extension on the lives of others.

00:19:33.240 --> 00:19:35.350
I think this is a plausible hypothesis,

00:19:35.350 --> 00:19:37.020
but the timing doesn't really work.

00:19:37.020 --> 00:19:39.970
Because economic historians tell us

00:19:39.970 --> 00:19:43.110
that the increase in material well-being

00:19:43.110 --> 00:19:46.230
only really started to take
off in the 19th century,

00:19:46.230 --> 00:19:48.800
with the advent of the
Industrial Revolution.

00:19:48.800 --> 00:19:50.960
Whereas most of these humanitarian reforms

00:19:50.960 --> 00:19:52.960
took place in the 18th century.

00:19:52.960 --> 00:19:55.810
You can't see the lines
that I've drawn here,

00:19:55.810 --> 00:19:57.893
they're a little bit too faint,

00:19:57.893 --> 00:19:59.269
but during this period

00:19:59.269 --> 00:20:00.830
there's virtually no real economic growth,

00:20:00.830 --> 00:20:03.280
and that's when people started to realize

00:20:03.280 --> 00:20:06.190
that burning heretics and
smashing people's arms and limbs

00:20:06.190 --> 00:20:08.890
on the wheel may not be the
best way to run a society.

00:20:11.197 --> 00:20:13.000
I think that another hypothesis,

00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:16.520
one in part advanced by
Lynn Hunt here at Berkeley,

00:20:16.520 --> 00:20:20.040
is more plausible and that the
rise of printing and literacy

00:20:20.040 --> 00:20:23.240
at least antedated the
humanitarian revolution

00:20:23.240 --> 00:20:25.650
and therefore is a more
plausible hypothesis

00:20:25.650 --> 00:20:26.873
about its cause.

00:20:27.950 --> 00:20:32.950
Prior to the 18th century
there was a 25-fold increase

00:20:33.490 --> 00:20:36.280
in the economic efficiency
in producing books.

00:20:36.280 --> 00:20:39.910
It's the only industry that
showed an increase in efficiency

00:20:39.910 --> 00:20:41.793
prior to the Industrial Revolution.

00:20:42.720 --> 00:20:44.750
This technology was put into practice,

00:20:44.750 --> 00:20:48.120
and in the 18th century there
was an exponential increase

00:20:48.120 --> 00:20:50.802
in the number of books
published per decade.

00:20:50.802 --> 00:20:53.390
A kind of early version of Moore's Law.

00:20:53.390 --> 00:20:55.690
And in the 18th century,
for the first time,

00:20:55.690 --> 00:20:58.630
a majority of Europeans
could read those books.

00:20:58.630 --> 00:21:01.120
This was the era in which literacy rate

00:21:01.120 --> 00:21:04.230
first surpassed the 50% mark.

00:21:04.230 --> 00:21:05.830
Why should literacy matter?

00:21:05.830 --> 00:21:08.540
Well there's another name for this era,

00:21:08.540 --> 00:21:10.720
it's also called the Enlightenment.

00:21:10.720 --> 00:21:12.740
Because this was the
era in which knowledge

00:21:12.740 --> 00:21:15.820
began to replace
superstition and ignorance.

00:21:15.820 --> 00:21:19.070
And it's not implausible that a literate

00:21:19.070 --> 00:21:21.320
and educated populace is less likely

00:21:21.320 --> 00:21:24.110
to believe in nonsense such as

00:21:24.110 --> 00:21:27.950
that the Jews poisoned the
wells, heretics go to hell,

00:21:27.950 --> 00:21:30.490
crop failures are caused by witches,

00:21:30.490 --> 00:21:31.940
children are possessed by the devil,

00:21:31.940 --> 00:21:33.750
which has to be beaten out of them,

00:21:33.750 --> 00:21:36.660
Africans are brutish and
fit only for slavery.

00:21:36.660 --> 00:21:40.550
And that's bound to undermine
many rationales for violence.

00:21:40.550 --> 00:21:42.447
As Voltaire said during this era,

00:21:42.447 --> 00:21:44.787
"Those who can make
you believe absurdities

00:21:44.787 --> 00:21:47.910
"can make you commit atrocities."

00:21:47.910 --> 00:21:50.020
Also, as Hunt points out,

00:21:50.020 --> 00:21:52.880
literacy is a technology
of cosmopolitanism,

00:21:52.880 --> 00:21:56.310
of the mixing of people and ideas.

00:21:56.310 --> 00:21:59.110
And it is not implausible,
I'll return to this

00:21:59.110 --> 00:22:02.430
later in the talk, that the
consumption of fiction and drama

00:22:02.430 --> 00:22:06.670
and history and journalism
gets people into the habit

00:22:06.670 --> 00:22:09.150
of inhabiting other people's minds.

00:22:09.150 --> 00:22:12.730
They try to imagine what
it's like to be someone else.

00:22:12.730 --> 00:22:17.400
And conceivably that could
lead to less dehumanization,

00:22:17.400 --> 00:22:20.433
less cruelty, and an
expanded sense of empathy.

00:22:22.140 --> 00:22:24.480
OK, the fourth historical
decline of violence

00:22:24.480 --> 00:22:26.550
has been called the Long Peace.

00:22:26.550 --> 00:22:29.030
And it speaks to the
frequently made assertion

00:22:29.030 --> 00:22:32.400
that the 20th century was
the most violent in history.

00:22:32.400 --> 00:22:35.310
One reads this all the
time, it's a popular meme,

00:22:35.310 --> 00:22:38.920
but it turns out that there
are no data in support of it,

00:22:38.920 --> 00:22:43.490
that no one cites numbers
from any other century.

00:22:43.490 --> 00:22:46.880
So this is a trend based on one point.

00:22:46.880 --> 00:22:50.080
And in fact there are many
reasons to doubt that it is true.

00:22:50.080 --> 00:22:53.030
Even looking at the so-called
peaceful 19th century,

00:22:53.030 --> 00:22:55.970
which is often held up by comparison

00:22:55.970 --> 00:22:58.230
as more peaceful than the 20th century,

00:22:58.230 --> 00:23:00.160
the case is not so clear.

00:23:00.160 --> 00:23:04.038
The so-called peaceful 19th
century had the Napoleonic Wars,

00:23:04.038 --> 00:23:07.610
after the World Wars,
the most destructive war

00:23:07.610 --> 00:23:10.300
in European history,
with 4 million deaths.

00:23:10.300 --> 00:23:12.240
The Taiping Rebellion in China,

00:23:12.240 --> 00:23:16.060
the most destructive civil war
in history, with 20 million.

00:23:16.060 --> 00:23:18.270
The most destructive
war in American history

00:23:18.270 --> 00:23:19.740
took place in the 19th century,

00:23:19.740 --> 00:23:21.920
namely the American Civil War.

00:23:21.920 --> 00:23:24.600
In Africa we have the
conquests of Shaka Zulu,

00:23:24.600 --> 00:23:27.410
which killed perhaps
1 to 2 million people.

00:23:27.410 --> 00:23:29.680
In South America we have
the most destructive

00:23:29.680 --> 00:23:32.340
interstate war in history,
proportionally speaking,

00:23:32.340 --> 00:23:34.502
the War of the Triple Alliance,

00:23:34.502 --> 00:23:37.830
which may have killed 60% of
the population of Paraguay.

00:23:37.830 --> 00:23:42.240
Not to mention slave-raiding
wars in Africa,

00:23:42.240 --> 00:23:45.690
and imperial wars in Africa,
Asia, and the South Pacific,

00:23:45.690 --> 00:23:47.713
for which numbers aren't even available.

00:23:48.810 --> 00:23:52.410
Also, while it is undoubtedly
true that the worst event

00:23:52.410 --> 00:23:54.730
in the 20th century, World War II,

00:23:54.730 --> 00:23:57.230
was the deadliest event in human history

00:23:57.230 --> 00:23:59.610
in terms of absolute
number of people killed,

00:23:59.610 --> 00:24:02.270
it's not so clear that it
was the worst in history

00:24:02.270 --> 00:24:04.640
in terms of the percentage
of the world's population

00:24:04.640 --> 00:24:05.780
that was affected.

00:24:05.780 --> 00:24:07.610
A lot of people were
killed in World War II

00:24:07.610 --> 00:24:12.610
but there were a lot of people
around in those days as well.

00:24:12.970 --> 00:24:15.370
Here I've taken a dataset from a man

00:24:15.370 --> 00:24:19.260
who calls himself an
atrocitologist, Matthew white,

00:24:19.260 --> 00:24:22.510
from his book the Great Big
Book of Horrible Things.

00:24:22.510 --> 00:24:25.160
And it includes an appendix consisting of

00:24:25.160 --> 00:24:27.265
the hundred worst things

00:24:27.265 --> 00:24:29.030
that people have ever done to one another.

00:24:29.030 --> 00:24:32.300
And I've just scaled them by
the population of the world

00:24:32.300 --> 00:24:34.290
at the midpoint of the atrocity.

00:24:34.290 --> 00:24:37.980
It goes from 500 BCE to 2,000 CE.

00:24:37.980 --> 00:24:41.810
And as you can see
history's worst atrocities

00:24:41.810 --> 00:24:43.350
were pretty evenly sprinkled

00:24:43.350 --> 00:24:46.250
over 2,500 years of human history.

00:24:46.250 --> 00:24:48.390
World War II comes in at ninth place,

00:24:48.390 --> 00:24:51.290
World War I doesn't even make the top 10.

00:24:51.290 --> 00:24:55.070
Now you can't fail to notice
the data cloud funnels downward

00:24:55.070 --> 00:24:56.990
as you get closer to the present,

00:24:56.990 --> 00:24:59.610
but presumably this doesn't
mean that in ancient times

00:24:59.610 --> 00:25:02.100
they only committed really big atrocities,

00:25:02.100 --> 00:25:04.510
and more recently we've
been committing medium-sized

00:25:04.510 --> 00:25:06.410
and small-sized ones as well.

00:25:06.410 --> 00:25:08.210
Much more likely this is a reflection

00:25:08.210 --> 00:25:09.690
of the historical record.

00:25:09.690 --> 00:25:12.020
Namely that the farther back you go

00:25:12.020 --> 00:25:14.170
the more likely it is that the small stuff

00:25:14.170 --> 00:25:17.210
would not have been recorded by historians

00:25:17.210 --> 00:25:18.760
and passed down to the present.

00:25:19.700 --> 00:25:24.550
If we put a magnifying
glass on the last 500 years,

00:25:24.550 --> 00:25:27.310
the era of the printing press,

00:25:27.310 --> 00:25:29.730
for which the data are more complete,

00:25:29.730 --> 00:25:33.190
we can take a finer grained
look at trends in war.

00:25:33.190 --> 00:25:36.720
In particular, Great Power
war, these are the wars

00:25:36.720 --> 00:25:40.063
between the 800-pound gorillas of the day,

00:25:41.128 --> 00:25:42.410
the states that have the capacity

00:25:42.410 --> 00:25:45.480
to project military force
beyond their own boundaries.

00:25:45.480 --> 00:25:47.140
And the political scientist Jack Levy

00:25:47.140 --> 00:25:49.323
has assembled such a data set.

00:25:51.660 --> 00:25:54.640
The first graph shows, from
the year 1500 to the present,

00:25:54.640 --> 00:25:57.010
the proportion of years
that the Great Powers

00:25:57.010 --> 00:26:00.350
fought each other, the
clashes of the titans.

00:26:00.350 --> 00:26:02.940
And it shows that several centuries ago

00:26:02.940 --> 00:26:04.600
the Great Powers were pretty much always

00:26:04.600 --> 00:26:05.770
at war with each other.

00:26:05.770 --> 00:26:07.210
That's just what Great Powers did,

00:26:07.210 --> 00:26:08.840
they fought other Great Powers.

00:26:08.840 --> 00:26:10.550
More recently they've hardly ever been

00:26:10.550 --> 00:26:11.713
at war with each other.

00:26:13.113 --> 00:26:14.860
Here we have a graph
showing the duration of wars

00:26:14.860 --> 00:26:19.160
involving a Great Power
on at least one side.

00:26:19.160 --> 00:26:22.780
And it shows a decline
in how long wars lasted.

00:26:22.780 --> 00:26:25.920
History used to have things
like the Thirty Years War

00:26:25.920 --> 00:26:28.920
and the Eighty Years War
and the Hundred Years War.

00:26:28.920 --> 00:26:31.433
The 20th century had the Six Day War.

00:26:33.120 --> 00:26:36.299
Here we have a graph showing
the frequency of wars

00:26:36.299 --> 00:26:37.548
involving a Great Power.

00:26:37.548 --> 00:26:38.620
How often would a Great Power pick a fight

00:26:38.620 --> 00:26:39.870
that resulted in a war.

00:26:39.870 --> 00:26:43.770
And that has been in
decline over 500 years.

00:26:43.770 --> 00:26:45.310
There is however one trend

00:26:45.310 --> 00:26:47.170
that went in the opposite direction

00:26:47.170 --> 00:26:48.870
over most of this period.

00:26:48.870 --> 00:26:52.327
That is, once a Great
Power did start a war,

00:26:52.327 --> 00:26:57.327
how good was it at killing
lots of people quickly?

00:26:57.940 --> 00:27:01.990
That is what is the rate
of death per country,

00:27:01.990 --> 00:27:03.450
per war per year.

00:27:03.450 --> 00:27:04.883
And because of advances,

00:27:05.882 --> 00:27:07.110
I guess if you can call them that,

00:27:07.110 --> 00:27:08.690
in military organization and weaponry,

00:27:08.690 --> 00:27:12.630
wars when they did break out
got deadlier and deadlier,

00:27:12.630 --> 00:27:15.170
up to the climax of World War II,

00:27:15.170 --> 00:27:17.550
at which even this curve does a U-turn.

00:27:17.550 --> 00:27:20.240
And for the last 2/3 of a century

00:27:20.240 --> 00:27:24.510
wars have become less deadly
as well as being shorter

00:27:24.510 --> 00:27:26.053
and less frequent.

00:27:27.370 --> 00:27:29.670
If you multiply these figures together

00:27:29.670 --> 00:27:32.470
and just look at the
aggregate number of people

00:27:32.470 --> 00:27:34.520
killed in Great Power wars,

00:27:34.520 --> 00:27:36.820
and I'm sorry, I should
have mentioned this earlier.

00:27:36.820 --> 00:27:38.380
An important statistical fact

00:27:38.380 --> 00:27:40.640
about the distribution of deaths in wars

00:27:40.640 --> 00:27:44.960
is that the biggest wars
kill the most people.

00:27:44.960 --> 00:27:47.620
That is once you account
for the Great Power wars

00:27:47.620 --> 00:27:50.650
you've accounted for a
majority of all the people

00:27:50.650 --> 00:27:52.820
who are killed in all wars combined,

00:27:52.820 --> 00:27:54.393
including the smaller ones.

00:27:55.370 --> 00:27:58.170
Well here's what you get, you
get kind of a zigzaggy curve,

00:27:58.170 --> 00:28:02.860
but one for which the
lowest point in 500 years

00:28:02.860 --> 00:28:05.403
is the most recent quarter-century.

00:28:07.170 --> 00:28:10.050
We can then zoom in on
the last hundred years

00:28:10.050 --> 00:28:12.800
for which the data are richer yet again,

00:28:12.800 --> 00:28:14.460
being closer to the present.

00:28:14.460 --> 00:28:16.077
And here's a look at the 20th century

00:28:16.077 --> 00:28:18.990
and the first decade of the 21st century.

00:28:18.990 --> 00:28:20.990
There is no question that there were two

00:28:20.990 --> 00:28:23.890
horrific spikes of bloodshed
in the 20th century

00:28:23.890 --> 00:28:26.390
centered around the two World Wars.

00:28:26.390 --> 00:28:29.210
But far from being a crescendo

00:28:29.210 --> 00:28:31.540
that would lead to an even worse war,

00:28:31.540 --> 00:28:34.460
since World War II the
bottom has kind of fallen out

00:28:34.460 --> 00:28:39.460
and the curve bumps along the X-axis.

00:28:40.210 --> 00:28:42.060
This is the period that
historians have called

00:28:42.060 --> 00:28:43.420
the Long Peace.

00:28:43.420 --> 00:28:45.620
The fact that since 1946 there's been

00:28:45.620 --> 00:28:49.900
a historically unprecedented
decline in interstate war,

00:28:49.900 --> 00:28:52.410
wars with a government on each side.

00:28:52.410 --> 00:28:54.870
In fact the most interesting
statistic from this period

00:28:54.870 --> 00:28:57.730
is zero, that refers to the number of wars

00:28:57.730 --> 00:29:00.340
between the two greatest
powers of them all,

00:29:00.340 --> 00:29:02.600
the United States and the Soviet Union,

00:29:02.600 --> 00:29:06.030
which never fought a direct
war against each other.

00:29:06.030 --> 00:29:08.813
Contrary as those of us
who remember this era,

00:29:10.290 --> 00:29:14.595
contrary to every expert who
predicted that World War III,

00:29:14.595 --> 00:29:15.750
between the US and the Soviet Union,

00:29:15.750 --> 00:29:18.360
was inevitable, but it never happened.

00:29:18.360 --> 00:29:21.320
No nuclear weapon has
been used since Nagasaki.

00:29:21.320 --> 00:29:24.260
Again, contrary to every expert prediction

00:29:24.260 --> 00:29:28.730
that a thermonuclear World
War was just a matter of time.

00:29:28.730 --> 00:29:31.150
There have been no wars
between any two Great Powers

00:29:31.150 --> 00:29:33.610
since 1953, more than 50 years ago,

00:29:33.610 --> 00:29:35.570
the end of the Korean War.

00:29:35.570 --> 00:29:37.490
60 years ago, I'm sorry.

00:29:37.490 --> 00:29:39.240
There have been no wars between any two

00:29:39.240 --> 00:29:41.830
Western European countries since 1945,

00:29:41.830 --> 00:29:45.930
a fact that we almost take for
granted as banal and obvious.

00:29:45.930 --> 00:29:47.930
Like, you know, who would ever expect say,

00:29:47.930 --> 00:29:49.833
Germany and France to fight a war?

00:29:50.720 --> 00:29:52.970
But needless to say this is a historically

00:29:52.970 --> 00:29:55.470
highly unusual state of affairs.

00:29:55.470 --> 00:29:59.410
Prior to 1945, Western
European countries alone

00:29:59.410 --> 00:30:02.400
started two new wars for 600 years.

00:30:02.400 --> 00:30:05.410
As of 1945 that fell to zero.

00:30:05.410 --> 00:30:08.410
And there have been no wars
between developed countries

00:30:08.410 --> 00:30:10.320
for the last 2/3 of a century.

00:30:10.320 --> 00:30:13.990
The 44 countries with the
highest GDP per capita

00:30:13.990 --> 00:30:16.260
have not fought a war against each other.

00:30:16.260 --> 00:30:19.130
Again, if that sounds obvious to you,

00:30:19.130 --> 00:30:22.170
like you know, war,
that's the kind of thing

00:30:22.170 --> 00:30:24.310
that happens in those poor, backward,

00:30:24.310 --> 00:30:26.740
southern hemisphere kind of countries,

00:30:26.740 --> 00:30:29.870
that shows the magnitude
of the historical change.

00:30:29.870 --> 00:30:33.120
For much of human history it
was the big rich countries

00:30:33.120 --> 00:30:35.380
that were constantly at
each other's throats.

00:30:35.380 --> 00:30:36.880
And because big rich countries

00:30:36.880 --> 00:30:38.880
can afford big destructive armies

00:30:38.880 --> 00:30:41.653
they could rack up an awful
lot of deaths quickly.

00:30:43.740 --> 00:30:45.110
Well what about the rest of the world?

00:30:45.110 --> 00:30:47.250
I've spoken about Great Power wars,

00:30:47.250 --> 00:30:50.093
I've spoken about wars
involving rich countries.

00:30:51.130 --> 00:30:54.370
But in a development that
I call the New Peace,

00:30:54.370 --> 00:30:56.300
the Long Peace seems to be spreading

00:30:56.300 --> 00:30:58.120
to the rest of the world.

00:30:58.120 --> 00:31:00.110
Now since 1946, as I've mentioned,

00:31:00.110 --> 00:31:02.410
there have been fewer interstate wars,

00:31:02.410 --> 00:31:04.270
country against country.

00:31:04.270 --> 00:31:06.610
There have however been more civil wars,

00:31:06.610 --> 00:31:08.430
starting in the 1960s,

00:31:08.430 --> 00:31:10.630
a trend that went in
the opposite direction,

00:31:10.630 --> 00:31:13.600
as newly independent states
with inept governments

00:31:13.600 --> 00:31:16.180
defended themselves against
insurgent movements,

00:31:16.180 --> 00:31:19.770
with both sides armed,
financed, and egged on

00:31:19.770 --> 00:31:22.773
by the US and the Soviet Union.

00:31:23.720 --> 00:31:25.300
But after the Cold War

00:31:25.300 --> 00:31:29.050
the number of civil wars declined as well.

00:31:29.050 --> 00:31:31.910
So the question is which
wars kill more people,

00:31:31.910 --> 00:31:36.170
the interstate wars, which
have been petering out,

00:31:36.170 --> 00:31:40.710
or the civil wars, which
grew and then began to recede

00:31:40.710 --> 00:31:42.980
during the '60s, '70s, and '80s.

00:31:42.980 --> 00:31:46.050
And this graph gives you the answer.

00:31:46.050 --> 00:31:48.950
First I'm showing you a
number of bars that correspond

00:31:48.950 --> 00:31:51.830
to the rate of death in interstate wars,

00:31:51.830 --> 00:31:54.480
country against country, in each decade,

00:31:54.480 --> 00:31:58.490
from the '50s, '60s, '70s,
'80s, '90s, and 2000s.

00:31:58.490 --> 00:32:00.340
Here we have the corresponding figure

00:32:00.340 --> 00:32:02.090
for internationalized civil war,

00:32:02.090 --> 00:32:05.360
civil wars in which some
third party butts in,

00:32:05.360 --> 00:32:07.560
usually to help the
government defend itself.

00:32:07.560 --> 00:32:09.130
And here we have the rate of death

00:32:09.130 --> 00:32:11.440
from purely internal civil wars.

00:32:11.440 --> 00:32:15.130
So as you can see the
decline in the death rate

00:32:15.130 --> 00:32:18.840
from interstate wars has
not been compensated for

00:32:18.840 --> 00:32:22.740
by nearly as much of an
increase in the death rate

00:32:22.740 --> 00:32:24.810
from civil wars.

00:32:24.810 --> 00:32:26.790
What if you then put these together,

00:32:26.790 --> 00:32:29.380
the number of wars of each kind,

00:32:29.380 --> 00:32:32.830
multiplied by the deadliness of each war?

00:32:32.830 --> 00:32:36.130
Well here's a graph showing
the overall trajectory

00:32:36.130 --> 00:32:38.900
of deaths in wars of
all kinds put together.

00:32:38.900 --> 00:32:41.757
And it's a stacked layer graph

00:32:41.757 --> 00:32:43.285
where the thickness of each layer

00:32:43.285 --> 00:32:45.260
corresponds to the rate of death from war

00:32:45.260 --> 00:32:48.010
in one of each of four categories.

00:32:48.010 --> 00:32:50.050
And the height of the entire stack

00:32:50.050 --> 00:32:52.760
shows the proportion of
the world's population

00:32:52.760 --> 00:32:55.620
that's killed in all wars combined.

00:32:55.620 --> 00:32:57.150
So first we have colonial wars,

00:32:57.150 --> 00:33:01.656
where a European empire tried
to hang on to its colonies,

00:33:01.656 --> 00:33:04.790
and that tapered off to zero in the 1970s.

00:33:04.790 --> 00:33:08.090
Here are the deaths from interstate wars,

00:33:08.090 --> 00:33:09.200
country against country,

00:33:09.200 --> 00:33:12.160
with spikes corresponding
to the Korean War,

00:33:12.160 --> 00:33:15.540
the Vietnam War, and the Iran-Iraq War.

00:33:15.540 --> 00:33:17.160
Here we have the rate of death

00:33:17.160 --> 00:33:20.060
from purely internal civil wars

00:33:20.060 --> 00:33:21.780
and from internationalized civil wars.

00:33:21.780 --> 00:33:23.640
So we have something of a rollercoaster,

00:33:23.640 --> 00:33:27.030
with a number of local reversals,
but the overall trajectory

00:33:27.030 --> 00:33:30.220
has been downward and here
we are in the 21st century

00:33:30.220 --> 00:33:34.300
with a thin laminate of
layers of wars of all kind,

00:33:34.300 --> 00:33:35.900
showing that we're living in an era

00:33:35.900 --> 00:33:39.890
in which fewer people that
ever before are dying in war.

00:33:39.890 --> 00:33:44.880
Now what about in the last five years?

00:33:44.880 --> 00:33:47.810
2008 was the year with the last figures

00:33:47.810 --> 00:33:50.640
that were available to
me when I sent my book,

00:33:50.640 --> 00:33:53.560
Better Angels of Our Nature,
off to the publishers.

00:33:53.560 --> 00:33:58.500
I've recently updated the
graph with more recent figures

00:33:58.500 --> 00:34:01.150
addressing the concern
that with the Arab Spring

00:34:01.150 --> 00:34:02.230
and the wars in its wake,

00:34:02.230 --> 00:34:04.050
particularly the civil war in Syria,

00:34:04.050 --> 00:34:06.610
have we seen a reversal.

00:34:06.610 --> 00:34:09.530
And the answer is that
we have a little bit.

00:34:09.530 --> 00:34:11.130
See this little uptick here,

00:34:11.130 --> 00:34:14.290
that reflects the number of
deaths from among other things

00:34:14.290 --> 00:34:16.380
the civil war in Syria.

00:34:16.380 --> 00:34:19.290
But overall it doesn't come
anywhere close to reversing

00:34:19.290 --> 00:34:21.813
the long-term trend since
the end of World War II.

00:34:22.840 --> 00:34:25.270
Well what were the immediate
causes of the Long Peace

00:34:25.270 --> 00:34:27.150
and the New Peace?

00:34:27.150 --> 00:34:30.870
Three of them were advanced
more than two centuries ago

00:34:30.870 --> 00:34:34.280
by Immanuel Kant in his
essay Perpetual Peace,

00:34:34.280 --> 00:34:38.100
in which he argued that
democracy, international trade,

00:34:38.100 --> 00:34:39.810
and an international community

00:34:39.810 --> 00:34:43.640
all disincentivized leaders
from dragging their countries

00:34:43.640 --> 00:34:45.580
into stupid wars.

00:34:45.580 --> 00:34:47.840
More recently the political
scientists Bruce Russett

00:34:47.840 --> 00:34:50.760
and John Oneal have
tested Kant's hypotheses

00:34:50.760 --> 00:34:55.200
quantitatively in a large data
set of militarized disputes.

00:34:55.200 --> 00:34:58.050
And they argue that the data
show that Kant got it right

00:34:58.050 --> 00:34:59.770
three out of three times.

00:34:59.770 --> 00:35:02.090
That all three of these
factors have increased

00:35:02.090 --> 00:35:04.800
over the course of the second
half of the 20th century.

00:35:04.800 --> 00:35:07.550
And all of them are statistical predictors

00:35:07.550 --> 00:35:08.950
of peace down the line,

00:35:08.950 --> 00:35:12.193
holding constant every
other conceivable variable.

00:35:14.340 --> 00:35:15.970
The final decline of violence

00:35:15.970 --> 00:35:17.730
I call the Rights Revolutions.

00:35:17.730 --> 00:35:19.880
And this refers to the
targeting of violence

00:35:19.880 --> 00:35:23.580
on smaller scales, directed
against vulnerable sectors

00:35:23.580 --> 00:35:26.460
of the population such
as African Americans

00:35:26.460 --> 00:35:31.460
and other racial
minorities, women, children,

00:35:32.440 --> 00:35:35.620
homosexuals, and animals.

00:35:35.620 --> 00:35:37.890
The civil rights revolution first of all

00:35:37.890 --> 00:35:40.083
put and end to the practice of lynching.

00:35:41.380 --> 00:35:43.630
Lynchings used to take
place in this country

00:35:43.630 --> 00:35:45.770
at a rate of 150 a year.

00:35:45.770 --> 00:35:49.300
That's three a week at the
end of the 19th century.

00:35:49.300 --> 00:35:52.103
By the 1950s that rate had fallen to zero.

00:35:53.060 --> 00:35:55.470
More recently the FBI
has been keeping track

00:35:55.470 --> 00:36:00.470
of hate crime violence directed
against African Americans,

00:36:02.040 --> 00:36:04.300
such as intimidation and assault.

00:36:04.300 --> 00:36:05.920
And all three have been in decline

00:36:05.920 --> 00:36:08.573
since records were first kept in the 90s.

00:36:09.899 --> 00:36:11.540
And the kind of racist attitudes

00:36:11.540 --> 00:36:14.440
that licensed violence against minorities

00:36:14.440 --> 00:36:16.720
has also been in steady decline.

00:36:16.720 --> 00:36:21.610
This graph shows the results
of two sets of opinion polls

00:36:21.610 --> 00:36:24.050
asking white Americans the
question, do you believe

00:36:24.050 --> 00:36:26.710
that black and white students
should go to separate schools,

00:36:26.710 --> 00:36:30.330
and if a black family moved in
next door would you move out?

00:36:30.330 --> 00:36:35.330
In the 1940s a majority of
people favored racial segregation

00:36:36.140 --> 00:36:38.740
and close to a majority would move out

00:36:38.740 --> 00:36:40.890
if a black family moved next door.

00:36:40.890 --> 00:36:42.830
That has been in steady
decline to the point

00:36:42.830 --> 00:36:45.270
that the positive results

00:36:45.270 --> 00:36:47.740
fall into the range of crank opinion,

00:36:47.740 --> 00:36:50.440
and the pollsters have just
eliminated the question

00:36:50.440 --> 00:36:51.743
from their surveys.

00:36:53.010 --> 00:36:55.410
This is not just an American phenomenon,

00:36:55.410 --> 00:36:57.500
but may be part of a worldwide trend.

00:36:57.500 --> 00:36:59.810
This graph shows the number of countries

00:36:59.810 --> 00:37:03.490
that have apartheid or Jim
Crow laws on their books

00:37:04.382 --> 00:37:06.260
that discriminate against
their ethnic minorities.

00:37:06.260 --> 00:37:08.370
The blue line shows
the number of countries

00:37:08.370 --> 00:37:10.930
that bend over backwards
in the other direction,

00:37:10.930 --> 00:37:12.810
that have various affirmative action

00:37:12.810 --> 00:37:15.040
or remedial discrimination policies

00:37:15.040 --> 00:37:18.760
designed to boost their
disadvantaged minorities.

00:37:18.760 --> 00:37:21.950
And so for the last few years
there have been more countries

00:37:21.950 --> 00:37:25.280
whose laws favor their minorities

00:37:25.280 --> 00:37:27.580
than countries that
discriminate against them.

00:37:28.540 --> 00:37:30.890
The women's rights
movement has brought about

00:37:30.890 --> 00:37:33.800
an 80% reduction in the rate of rape

00:37:33.800 --> 00:37:37.300
since statistics were
first kept in the 1970s.

00:37:37.300 --> 00:37:39.260
A similarly precipitous decline

00:37:39.260 --> 00:37:42.330
in rates of domestic
violence against women.

00:37:42.330 --> 00:37:45.670
And declines in the most extreme
form of domestic violence

00:37:45.670 --> 00:37:48.000
of all, namely uxoricide,

00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:50.570
the murder of female romantic partners,

00:37:50.570 --> 00:37:54.500
and mariticide, the murder
of male romantic partners.

00:37:54.500 --> 00:37:57.580
If anything the decline is
even steeper for male victims

00:37:57.580 --> 00:38:00.510
than for female victims, showing
that the women's movement

00:38:00.510 --> 00:38:02.563
has been very very good for husbands.

00:38:03.860 --> 00:38:06.610
The children's rights movement
has seen a steady decline

00:38:06.610 --> 00:38:09.080
in the use of corporal
punishment in schools,

00:38:09.080 --> 00:38:11.260
strapping and paddling.

00:38:11.260 --> 00:38:15.820
Where now a minority of states,
concentrated in the South,

00:38:15.820 --> 00:38:17.743
even allow the practice.

00:38:18.780 --> 00:38:21.730
Public opinion polls that ask people

00:38:21.730 --> 00:38:23.860
whether it is acceptable to spank a child

00:38:23.860 --> 00:38:26.670
have all shown declines.

00:38:26.670 --> 00:38:28.520
Rates of child abuse are down,

00:38:28.520 --> 00:38:31.500
both physical abuse and sexual abuse.

00:38:31.500 --> 00:38:35.830
And rates of violence in
which children are victims,

00:38:35.830 --> 00:38:39.650
such as fights and
non-fatal crimes in schools.

00:38:39.650 --> 00:38:42.630
The gay rights movement
has seen an increase

00:38:42.630 --> 00:38:43.600
in the number of states

00:38:43.600 --> 00:38:46.180
that have decriminalized homosexuality.

00:38:46.180 --> 00:38:49.700
Not just states worldwide
but American states,

00:38:49.700 --> 00:38:51.500
which now stands at 50 out of 50

00:38:51.500 --> 00:38:53.950
thanks to a Supreme Court decision.

00:38:53.950 --> 00:38:58.950
Anti-gay attitudes such as, is
homosexuality morally wrong,

00:38:58.970 --> 00:39:00.420
should it be criminalized,

00:39:00.420 --> 00:39:02.960
and should gay people be
denied equal opportunity,

00:39:02.960 --> 00:39:05.603
have all shown steady declines.

00:39:06.984 --> 00:39:10.110
And the animal rights movement,
finally, has seen a decline

00:39:10.110 --> 00:39:13.560
in hunting, an increase in vegetarianism,

00:39:13.560 --> 00:39:16.200
both in the UK and the US,

00:39:16.200 --> 00:39:19.360
and a sharp decline in the
number of motion pictures

00:39:19.360 --> 00:39:20.853
in which animals were harmed.

00:39:22.160 --> 00:39:25.640
Well this raises the question
why is violence declined

00:39:25.640 --> 00:39:30.130
on so many scales of time and magnitude?

00:39:30.130 --> 00:39:33.430
Now one possibility is that
human nature has changed

00:39:33.430 --> 00:39:36.060
and somehow our violent inclinations

00:39:36.060 --> 00:39:38.440
have literally been bred out of us.

00:39:38.440 --> 00:39:42.730
Well I consider this hypothesis coherent

00:39:42.730 --> 00:39:45.290
but empirically unlikely.

00:39:45.290 --> 00:39:49.531
For one thing we continue
to see violence in children.

00:39:49.531 --> 00:39:53.620
Almost half of two-year-olds
kick, bite, and hit.

00:39:53.620 --> 00:39:57.340
And rough-and-tumble play
is one of the most robust

00:39:57.340 --> 00:40:00.400
sex differences observed cross-culturally.

00:40:00.400 --> 00:40:04.260
Our grown-up children continue
to enjoy various forms

00:40:04.260 --> 00:40:07.000
of vicarious violence
such as murder mysteries,

00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:09.990
Greek tragedies, Shakespearean dramas,

00:40:09.990 --> 00:40:13.700
video games, hockey, and movies starring

00:40:13.700 --> 00:40:16.433
a certain ex-governor of this very state.

00:40:17.700 --> 00:40:19.760
And then there are homicidal fantasies.

00:40:19.760 --> 00:40:23.580
A number of psychologists have
posed the following question

00:40:23.580 --> 00:40:24.870
to their subjects.

00:40:24.870 --> 00:40:27.720
Have you ever fantasized
about killing someone

00:40:27.720 --> 00:40:29.120
you don't like?

00:40:29.120 --> 00:40:32.600
And the results are
that about 15% of women

00:40:32.600 --> 00:40:35.100
and a third of men frequently fantasize

00:40:35.100 --> 00:40:36.780
about killing people.

00:40:36.780 --> 00:40:40.120
And about 60% of women and 3/4 of men

00:40:40.120 --> 00:40:43.240
at least occasionally
fantasize about killing people.

00:40:43.240 --> 00:40:45.150
What does this tell us about human nature,

00:40:45.150 --> 00:40:48.013
it tells us that 25% men are liars.

00:40:49.036 --> 00:40:50.760
(audience laughing)

00:40:50.760 --> 00:40:53.860
A more likely possibility
is that human nature

00:40:53.860 --> 00:40:58.110
is extraordinarily complex
and it has always included

00:40:58.110 --> 00:41:01.840
both neural systems that
incline us toward violence

00:41:01.840 --> 00:41:04.200
and neural systems that counteract them,

00:41:04.200 --> 00:41:06.750
what Abraham Lincoln poetically called

00:41:06.750 --> 00:41:08.970
the "better angels of our nature."

00:41:08.970 --> 00:41:11.630
And that what has changed
over the course of history

00:41:11.630 --> 00:41:14.900
is that circumstances
have increasingly favored

00:41:14.900 --> 00:41:16.700
our peaceable motives.

00:41:16.700 --> 00:41:19.590
Well what are the motives for violence?

00:41:19.590 --> 00:41:21.780
Neurobiologists have
known for quite some time

00:41:21.780 --> 00:41:24.280
that there is no single
thing called aggression,

00:41:24.280 --> 00:41:26.654
that there are multiple
systems in the brain

00:41:26.654 --> 00:41:28.830
behind violent acts.

00:41:28.830 --> 00:41:32.130
Anyone who owns a cat
knows that when a cat

00:41:32.130 --> 00:41:37.130
is preparing for predation
it will quietly stalk a mouse

00:41:39.240 --> 00:41:43.320
or a cockroach or maybe
even a hallucination,

00:41:43.320 --> 00:41:48.300
and keep low to the ground,
exhibit quiet stalking behavior,

00:41:48.300 --> 00:41:50.820
a sudden pounce and a quick bite.

00:41:50.820 --> 00:41:53.910
Whereas when one male cat, not neutered,

00:41:53.910 --> 00:41:55.970
encounters another male cat,

00:41:55.970 --> 00:41:57.080
you get a kind of aggression

00:41:57.080 --> 00:41:58.310
that couldn't be more different.

00:41:58.310 --> 00:42:02.570
There's a lot of piloerection
and hissing and yowling,

00:42:02.570 --> 00:42:05.490
and then perhaps what we call a cat fight.

00:42:05.490 --> 00:42:10.080
And we know that these
two forms of aggression

00:42:10.080 --> 00:42:13.273
are controlled by different
circuits in the brain.

00:42:14.670 --> 00:42:17.240
Stepping back and looking
at the number of motives

00:42:17.240 --> 00:42:20.930
for violence in humans
there are four major ones

00:42:20.930 --> 00:42:22.700
that I try to lay out in the book.

00:42:22.700 --> 00:42:26.430
There's just sheer raw naked exploitation,

00:42:26.430 --> 00:42:30.670
the harming of a person that
happens to be an obstacle

00:42:30.670 --> 00:42:32.870
on the path to something that you want.

00:42:32.870 --> 00:42:35.210
Resulting in forms of
violence such as rape,

00:42:35.210 --> 00:42:38.620
plunder, conquest, and
the elimination of rivals.

00:42:38.620 --> 00:42:40.680
Very different is the drive for dominance,

00:42:40.680 --> 00:42:43.630
the urge among individuals
to climb the pecking order

00:42:43.630 --> 00:42:45.810
and become alpha male.

00:42:45.810 --> 00:42:48.240
And a corresponding motive among groups

00:42:48.240 --> 00:42:52.470
for ethnic, racial, national,
or religious supremacy.

00:42:52.470 --> 00:42:55.030
There's a revenge or moralistic violence,

00:42:55.030 --> 00:42:58.770
the urge to and the conviction

00:42:58.770 --> 00:43:01.830
that it is not just
permissible but mandatory

00:43:01.830 --> 00:43:04.730
to harm someone who's
committed a moral infraction,

00:43:04.730 --> 00:43:06.120
not to let them get away with it.

00:43:06.120 --> 00:43:08.960
Which results in vendettas, rough justice,

00:43:08.960 --> 00:43:10.850
and cruel punishment.

00:43:10.850 --> 00:43:13.220
Then moving from the
level of the individual

00:43:13.220 --> 00:43:17.410
to the social network, there
are utopian ideologies,

00:43:17.410 --> 00:43:21.010
ideas or memes that
spread from mind to mind

00:43:21.010 --> 00:43:24.100
that can often license
vast amounts of violence,

00:43:24.100 --> 00:43:26.710
such as militant religions, nationalism,

00:43:26.710 --> 00:43:28.763
Nazism, and communism.

00:43:29.600 --> 00:43:31.675
Which licenses violence

00:43:31.675 --> 00:43:33.270
by a kind of pernicious
cost-benefit analysis.

00:43:33.270 --> 00:43:35.440
What these ideologies have in common

00:43:35.440 --> 00:43:38.800
is that they hold out
the prospect of a utopia.

00:43:38.800 --> 00:43:42.230
Of a world that will be
infinitely good forever.

00:43:42.230 --> 00:43:46.100
Well if you are under the
throes of the conviction

00:43:46.100 --> 00:43:50.020
that such a utopia is possible
the ends are infinitely good.

00:43:50.020 --> 00:43:52.670
Well then you can commit as
much violence as you want

00:43:52.670 --> 00:43:54.790
to bring that kingdom of heaven to earth.

00:43:54.790 --> 00:43:57.290
And you're always on the
positive side of the ledger,

00:43:57.290 --> 00:43:59.680
you're always doing more good than harm.

00:43:59.680 --> 00:44:02.280
And let's say that you
announce your vision

00:44:02.280 --> 00:44:04.980
of an infinitely perfect
world and there's some people

00:44:05.840 --> 00:44:08.070
who just don't buy it, they
don't get with the program.

00:44:08.070 --> 00:44:09.360
How evil are they?

00:44:09.360 --> 00:44:11.370
Well they're the only
thing standing in the way

00:44:11.370 --> 00:44:14.340
of a world that will be
infinitely good forever.

00:44:14.340 --> 00:44:18.330
Well you do the math as to how
much punishment they deserve.

00:44:18.330 --> 00:44:22.050
As in the old communist slogan
you can't make an omelet

00:44:22.050 --> 00:44:23.700
without breaking eggs.

00:44:23.700 --> 00:44:27.330
Which of course ignores the
fact that people are not eggs.

00:44:27.330 --> 00:44:32.330
But it does explain the somewhat
superficially paradoxical

00:44:33.240 --> 00:44:37.400
fact that the worst
atrocities in human history

00:44:37.400 --> 00:44:41.220
were all carried out
in pursuit of a moral,

00:44:41.220 --> 00:44:42.963
higher idealistic good.

00:44:44.170 --> 00:44:45.620
Well that sounds pretty depressing,

00:44:45.620 --> 00:44:47.520
but what do we have on the other side,

00:44:48.573 --> 00:44:50.930
what circuits do we
have in the human brain

00:44:50.930 --> 00:44:53.920
that can push back against
our violent impulses?

00:44:53.920 --> 00:44:55.810
Well there's self-control.

00:44:55.810 --> 00:44:57.960
Systems in the prefrontal cortex

00:44:57.960 --> 00:45:00.600
that can anticipate the
consequences of behavior

00:45:00.600 --> 00:45:03.110
and inhibit our violent impulses.

00:45:03.110 --> 00:45:06.570
There's empathy, the ability
to feel others' pain.

00:45:06.570 --> 00:45:10.270
Probably underlain by the oxytocin system.

00:45:10.270 --> 00:45:13.520
There's a moral sense, a
set of norms and taboos

00:45:13.520 --> 00:45:17.450
that govern just what a
decent person considers

00:45:17.450 --> 00:45:19.660
within the realm of possibility.

00:45:19.660 --> 00:45:21.560
And there's reason.

00:45:21.560 --> 00:45:23.190
Cognitive processes that allow us

00:45:23.190 --> 00:45:27.010
to engage in objective, detached analysis.

00:45:27.010 --> 00:45:30.737
Well having laid out that
psychology of violence

00:45:30.737 --> 00:45:33.310
and non-violence, the question now is

00:45:33.310 --> 00:45:35.080
how do you bring the psychology

00:45:35.080 --> 00:45:37.080
back together with the history?

00:45:37.080 --> 00:45:38.660
Which historical developments

00:45:38.660 --> 00:45:40.610
bring out our better angels

00:45:40.610 --> 00:45:44.863
and stay our hands before they
can commit acts of bloodshed?

00:45:45.930 --> 00:45:48.190
One possibility is that
Hobbes got it right

00:45:48.190 --> 00:45:50.080
when he called for a Leviathan,

00:45:50.080 --> 00:45:54.203
a government with a monopoly
on the legitimate use of force.

00:45:55.050 --> 00:45:58.310
Now a state and judicial system
with a monopoly on violence

00:45:58.310 --> 00:46:01.860
can reduce actual outbreaks
of violence by first of all

00:46:01.860 --> 00:46:04.820
neutralizing the incentive
for exploitative attack

00:46:04.820 --> 00:46:08.140
by penalizing aggression
and therefore canceling out

00:46:08.140 --> 00:46:10.960
the aggressor's anticipated gain.

00:46:10.960 --> 00:46:13.160
That can then calm everyone down

00:46:13.160 --> 00:46:15.870
because not only are you deterred

00:46:15.870 --> 00:46:17.500
from attacking your neighbors but you know

00:46:17.500 --> 00:46:20.280
that your neighbors are
deterred from attacking you.

00:46:20.280 --> 00:46:24.560
And so it eliminates the
temptation for a preemptive strike,

00:46:24.560 --> 00:46:27.320
to do it to them before they do it to you.

00:46:27.320 --> 00:46:32.320
For broadcasting a belligerent
stance of macho strength

00:46:34.350 --> 00:46:37.900
in order to establish the
credibility of your deterrent.

00:46:37.900 --> 00:46:39.730
And of course eliminates the need

00:46:39.730 --> 00:46:42.440
to carry out revenge after the fact.

00:46:42.440 --> 00:46:43.790
You can outsource it

00:46:43.790 --> 00:46:47.060
to the state and its judicial apparatus.

00:46:47.060 --> 00:46:50.120
And in doing so you're not just
trading one kind of violence

00:46:50.120 --> 00:46:53.930
for another because outsourcing
revenge to a third party

00:46:53.930 --> 00:46:57.060
means that you are circumventing
the self-serving biases

00:46:57.060 --> 00:46:58.820
that social psychologists have shown

00:46:58.820 --> 00:47:01.000
that all humans are prone to.

00:47:01.000 --> 00:47:04.380
Where in any dispute
both sides always believe

00:47:04.380 --> 00:47:07.840
that their opponent's attacks
are unprovoked aggression,

00:47:07.840 --> 00:47:08.760
out of the blue.

00:47:08.760 --> 00:47:11.880
Whereas their own attacks
are justified retaliation

00:47:11.880 --> 00:47:13.210
after the fact.

00:47:13.210 --> 00:47:15.340
Well when you have both
sides in the throes

00:47:15.340 --> 00:47:17.880
of these self-serving illusions

00:47:17.880 --> 00:47:22.770
one side can count an
odd number of attacks

00:47:22.770 --> 00:47:24.970
and feel that justice must be done.

00:47:24.970 --> 00:47:26.620
Another counts an even number

00:47:26.620 --> 00:47:29.370
and figures that the scores
have all been settled.

00:47:29.370 --> 00:47:31.460
And that can lead to endless cycles

00:47:31.460 --> 00:47:33.740
of a blood feud and vendetta.

00:47:33.740 --> 00:47:35.870
Cycles which can be nipped in the bud

00:47:35.870 --> 00:47:38.250
when it is a disinterested third party

00:47:38.250 --> 00:47:41.993
that is assessing the harm
and meting out the punishment.

00:47:43.020 --> 00:47:44.580
Some historical evidence comes from

00:47:44.580 --> 00:47:47.840
the pacifying and
civilizing effects of states

00:47:47.840 --> 00:47:52.110
that I alluded to in historical
trends number one and two.

00:47:52.110 --> 00:47:55.790
And the fact that you can
watch this movie in reverse.

00:47:55.790 --> 00:48:00.790
When government breaks down
and zones of anarchy emerge,

00:48:01.130 --> 00:48:03.370
such as the American Wild West,

00:48:03.370 --> 00:48:06.380
where you all remember the
cliche in the cowboy movies,

00:48:06.380 --> 00:48:09.470
that the nearest sheriff
is 120 miles away,

00:48:09.470 --> 00:48:12.230
so you've got to defend
yourself with your six-shooter.

00:48:12.230 --> 00:48:15.380
In failed states, collapsed empires.

00:48:15.380 --> 00:48:19.190
And contraband economies
like mafias and street gangs

00:48:19.190 --> 00:48:22.240
where you can't file a lawsuit

00:48:22.240 --> 00:48:24.410
if you think you've
been cheated in a deal.

00:48:24.410 --> 00:48:28.990
You can't dial 911 if you feel threatened.

00:48:28.990 --> 00:48:33.420
The only protection is a
willingness and ability

00:48:33.420 --> 00:48:36.660
to commit violence to
protect your interests.

00:48:36.660 --> 00:48:39.400
And in all of these
cases of zones of anarchy

00:48:39.400 --> 00:48:43.233
you have quite obviously
high rates of violence.

00:48:44.250 --> 00:48:47.220
A second possibility is the
theory of gentle commerce,

00:48:47.220 --> 00:48:50.020
doux commerce, an idea
from the Enlightenment,

00:48:50.020 --> 00:48:53.760
that argues that plunder
is a zero-sum game.

00:48:53.760 --> 00:48:57.130
The victor's gain is the victim's loss.

00:48:57.130 --> 00:48:59.070
Whereas trade is a positive-sum game.

00:48:59.070 --> 00:49:01.610
If you exchange your
surpluses then, as we say,

00:49:01.610 --> 00:49:03.320
everybody wins.

00:49:03.320 --> 00:49:05.450
And as over the course of history

00:49:06.541 --> 00:49:08.530
improving technology has
allowed goods and ideas

00:49:08.530 --> 00:49:10.650
to be traded over longer distances

00:49:10.650 --> 00:49:13.760
among larger groups of
people and at lower cost,

00:49:13.760 --> 00:49:16.780
it becomes cheaper to buy
things than to steal them,

00:49:16.780 --> 00:49:18.880
and other people become
more valuable to you

00:49:18.880 --> 00:49:20.680
alive than dead.

00:49:20.680 --> 00:49:24.050
And there is some historical
evidence for this hypothesis.

00:49:24.050 --> 00:49:26.100
A number of statistical studies that show

00:49:26.100 --> 00:49:29.310
that companies with open
economies and a greater dependence

00:49:29.310 --> 00:49:32.810
on international trade fight fewer wars,

00:49:32.810 --> 00:49:37.480
host fewer civil wars,
and have fewer genocides.

00:49:37.480 --> 00:49:39.323
Holding all other factors constant.

00:49:40.170 --> 00:49:43.150
A third hypothesis has been
called the Expanding Circle

00:49:43.150 --> 00:49:45.950
in a book by that name by
the philosopher Peter Singer,

00:49:45.950 --> 00:49:48.750
but the idea goes back to Charles Darwin.

00:49:48.750 --> 00:49:52.690
Namely that humans come
equipped by natural selection

00:49:52.690 --> 00:49:54.390
with a sense of empathy.

00:49:54.390 --> 00:49:57.400
Unfortunately by default
we apply our empathy

00:49:57.400 --> 00:50:01.810
only within a very narrow
circle of friends and families

00:50:01.810 --> 00:50:04.123
and cute fuzzy little baby animals.

00:50:05.100 --> 00:50:06.450
But over the course of history

00:50:06.450 --> 00:50:09.520
one can see the circle
expanding to the village,

00:50:09.520 --> 00:50:13.050
the clan, the tribe,
the nation, other races,

00:50:13.050 --> 00:50:17.340
both sexes, children, and
perhaps eventually other species.

00:50:17.340 --> 00:50:19.450
Well this just begs the question

00:50:19.450 --> 00:50:21.340
of why should the circle have expanded.

00:50:21.340 --> 00:50:24.690
And I think the technologies
have increased cosmopolitanism

00:50:24.690 --> 00:50:26.830
are a plausible cause,

00:50:26.830 --> 00:50:29.800
that as people travel
more, consume more history,

00:50:29.800 --> 00:50:33.460
more literature and drama
and more journalism,

00:50:33.460 --> 00:50:38.240
they are less likely to dehumanize
people unlike themselves

00:50:38.240 --> 00:50:41.880
and more likely to imagine
what it's like to be them

00:50:41.880 --> 00:50:45.510
and have less of a taste for harming them.

00:50:45.510 --> 00:50:48.170
And there is experimental
evidence that when people

00:50:48.170 --> 00:50:51.100
adopt a real person's perspective,

00:50:51.100 --> 00:50:54.450
or for that matter the perspective
of a fictional character,

00:50:54.450 --> 00:50:57.790
they show more sympathy
both to that individual

00:50:57.790 --> 00:51:00.660
and to the category that
that individual represents.

00:51:00.660 --> 00:51:03.700
A number of social psychology experiments

00:51:03.700 --> 00:51:06.520
have replicated that finding.

00:51:06.520 --> 00:51:08.250
Finally there's the escalator of reason,

00:51:08.250 --> 00:51:10.800
the possibility that
the growth of literacy,

00:51:10.800 --> 00:51:12.940
education, and public discourse

00:51:12.940 --> 00:51:15.430
has encouraged people
to think more abstractly

00:51:15.430 --> 00:51:16.863
and more universally.

00:51:17.790 --> 00:51:20.550
We rise above our parochial vantage point.

00:51:20.550 --> 00:51:23.330
That makes it harder to
privilege your own interests

00:51:23.330 --> 00:51:26.470
over others just because
you're you and they're not.

00:51:26.470 --> 00:51:29.240
It encourages people to
stand back and recognize

00:51:29.240 --> 00:51:31.490
the futility of cycles of violence.

00:51:31.490 --> 00:51:34.890
And increasingly see violence
as a problem to be solved

00:51:34.890 --> 00:51:38.450
rather than as a contest to be won.

00:51:38.450 --> 00:51:41.240
Some historical evidence
comes from the fact that,

00:51:41.240 --> 00:51:44.220
again, believe it or not,
abstract reasoning abilities

00:51:44.220 --> 00:51:46.310
as measured by IQ,

00:51:46.310 --> 00:51:48.660
increased over the course
of the 20th century.

00:51:48.660 --> 00:51:51.910
The so-called Flynn
Effect, by which IQ scores

00:51:51.910 --> 00:51:55.430
increased by three points a decade

00:51:55.430 --> 00:51:59.150
throughout the 20th century
and all over the world.

00:51:59.150 --> 00:52:02.310
And other studies have shown
that people in societies

00:52:02.310 --> 00:52:06.110
with higher degrees of education
and measured intelligence

00:52:06.110 --> 00:52:10.720
commit fewer crimes, cooperate
more in experimental games,

00:52:10.720 --> 00:52:13.040
have more classically liberal attitudes,

00:52:13.040 --> 00:52:18.040
such as opposition to homophobia,
racism, and xenophobia,

00:52:18.830 --> 00:52:23.100
and are more receptive to
democracy 10 years down the line.

00:52:23.100 --> 00:52:26.410
The final question I'll
ask is why would these

00:52:26.410 --> 00:52:29.870
and other forces all be
pushing in the same direction?

00:52:29.870 --> 00:52:31.370
Why should there be not just one

00:52:31.370 --> 00:52:33.420
but several historical developments

00:52:33.420 --> 00:52:36.230
that all result in
lower rates of violence?

00:52:36.230 --> 00:52:39.500
Now I don't believe in any mysterious,

00:52:39.500 --> 00:52:43.500
mystical arc of history or dialectic

00:52:43.500 --> 00:52:48.500
or push toward an omega
point of perfect peace.

00:52:48.570 --> 00:52:51.180
Rather I think that violence
is what game theorists call

00:52:51.180 --> 00:52:52.550
a social dilemma.

00:52:52.550 --> 00:52:55.930
Namely it's tempting to an aggressor

00:52:55.930 --> 00:52:57.420
to exploit a victim,

00:52:57.420 --> 00:52:59.310
but of course the harm done to the victim

00:52:59.310 --> 00:53:02.830
is greater than the gains
enjoyed by the aggressor.

00:53:02.830 --> 00:53:06.800
Since in the long run
victims become aggressors

00:53:06.800 --> 00:53:10.690
and vice versa, all parties
would objectively be better off

00:53:10.690 --> 00:53:14.480
if everyone could agree
to refrain from violence.

00:53:14.480 --> 00:53:16.800
The dilemma is how do
you get the other guy

00:53:16.800 --> 00:53:20.110
to refrain from violence at
the same time that you do.

00:53:20.110 --> 00:53:22.870
Because if you beat your
swords into plowshares

00:53:22.870 --> 00:53:25.580
but the other guy keeps
his swords as swords,

00:53:25.580 --> 00:53:28.000
well you could find
yourself at the wrong end

00:53:28.000 --> 00:53:29.143
of an invading army.

00:53:30.290 --> 00:53:32.372
It's not implausible to think

00:53:32.372 --> 00:53:33.950
that over the course of
history human experience

00:53:33.950 --> 00:53:36.740
and human ingenuity have
gradually chipped away

00:53:36.740 --> 00:53:39.440
at this problem just as we've
dealt with other scourges

00:53:39.440 --> 00:53:42.320
of the human condition,
like pestilence and hunger.

00:53:42.320 --> 00:53:44.180
And the common denominator

00:53:44.180 --> 00:53:48.290
behind these four pacifying
forces is that all of them

00:53:48.290 --> 00:53:52.120
increase the material, emotional,
or cognitive incentives

00:53:52.120 --> 00:53:56.160
of all parties to avoid
violence simultaneously.

00:53:56.160 --> 00:53:58.580
Well regardless of what
the best explanation

00:53:58.580 --> 00:54:00.640
of the decline of violence turns out to be

00:54:00.640 --> 00:54:04.170
I think it has implications
that are profound.

00:54:04.170 --> 00:54:06.860
For one thing it calls for a
reorientation of our efforts

00:54:06.860 --> 00:54:10.170
towards violence reduction
from a moralistic mindset

00:54:10.170 --> 00:54:12.410
to an empirical mindset.

00:54:12.410 --> 00:54:15.010
Instead of lamenting why is there war,

00:54:15.010 --> 00:54:17.270
perhaps the question
we should be asking is,

00:54:17.270 --> 00:54:19.040
why is there peace?

00:54:19.040 --> 00:54:20.820
Not just what are we doing wrong,

00:54:20.820 --> 00:54:22.850
but what have we been doing right?

00:54:22.850 --> 00:54:25.220
Because we have been doing something right

00:54:25.220 --> 00:54:27.880
and it seems to me to be
quite important to figure out

00:54:27.880 --> 00:54:30.660
what exactly it is.

00:54:30.660 --> 00:54:32.820
Also the decline of violence

00:54:32.820 --> 00:54:36.243
I think calls for a
reassessment of modernity,

00:54:36.243 --> 00:54:39.670
of the centuries-long trend
that has eroded family,

00:54:39.670 --> 00:54:41.970
tribe, tradition, and religion,

00:54:41.970 --> 00:54:45.500
and giving way to individual rights,

00:54:45.500 --> 00:54:48.980
cosmopolitanism, reason, and science.

00:54:48.980 --> 00:54:50.890
Now, everyone has to acknowledge

00:54:50.890 --> 00:54:53.200
that modernity has brought us many gifts.

00:54:53.200 --> 00:54:57.080
Longer and healthier lives,
less ignorance and superstition,

00:54:57.080 --> 00:54:59.010
richer experiences.

00:54:59.010 --> 00:55:01.870
But there's always been
a current of nostalgia

00:55:01.870 --> 00:55:04.530
and romanticism that has
questioned the price.

00:55:04.530 --> 00:55:07.190
Is it worth it if we have
to live in the shadow

00:55:07.190 --> 00:55:11.253
of terrorism, genocide, world
wars, and nuclear weapons?

00:55:12.230 --> 00:55:14.280
On the other hand if, despite impressions,

00:55:14.280 --> 00:55:17.890
the long-term trend, though
halting and incomplete,

00:55:17.890 --> 00:55:20.820
is that violence of all
kinds is decreasing,

00:55:20.820 --> 00:55:23.170
I believe this calls for a rehabilitation

00:55:23.170 --> 00:55:26.150
of the ideals of modernity and progress.

00:55:26.150 --> 00:55:28.120
And it's a cause for gratitude

00:55:28.120 --> 00:55:31.350
for the institutions of
civilization and enlightenment

00:55:31.350 --> 00:55:33.400
that have made it possible.

00:55:33.400 --> 00:55:34.500
Thank you very much.

00:55:36.124 --> 00:55:39.374
(audience applauding)

00:55:43.906 --> 00:55:44.739
Thank you.

00:55:47.189 --> 00:55:49.856
(gentle music)
