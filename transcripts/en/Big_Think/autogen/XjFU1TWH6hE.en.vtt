ground reporting we've made our name on

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:36.780
ground reporting we've made our name on
 

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:39.380
ground reporting we've made our name on
this is by having sophisticated original

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:39.390
this is by having sophisticated original
 

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:42.200
this is by having sophisticated original
content and original reporting and that

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:42.210
content and original reporting and that
 

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:44.090
content and original reporting and that
also helps us to pursue a syndication

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:44.100
also helps us to pursue a syndication
 

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:45.950

we'll do the rest

00:06:09.810 --> 00:06:09.820
 

00:06:09.820 --> 00:06:12.150
I think that it's more important than

00:06:12.150 --> 00:06:12.160
I think that it's more important than
 

00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:13.650
I think that it's more important than
ever I think that first we need to

00:06:13.650 --> 00:06:13.660
ever I think that first we need to
 

00:06:13.660 --> 00:06:15.210
ever I think that first we need to
recognize that many of the people who we

00:06:15.210 --> 00:06:15.220
recognize that many of the people who we
 

00:06:15.220 --> 00:06:16.950
recognize that many of the people who we
consider to be professional journalists

00:06:16.950 --> 00:06:16.960
consider to be professional journalists
 

00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:19.110

and and and expend building work

00:06:24.210 --> 00:06:24.220
and and and expend building work
 

00:06:24.220 --> 00:06:27.150

experience but that we certainly need to

00:06:27.150 --> 00:06:27.160
experience but that we certainly need to
 

00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:28.800

reward entrepreneurial journalists I

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:28.810
reward entrepreneurial journalists I
 

00:06:28.810 --> 00:06:30.360
reward entrepreneurial journalists I
think now more than ever it is very

00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:30.370
think now more than ever it is very
 

00:06:30.370 --> 00:06:32.310
think now more than ever it is very
important to be a journalist who is able

00:06:32.310 --> 00:06:32.320
important to be a journalist who is able
 

00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:34.170
important to be a journalist who is able
to innovate who is able to be

00:06:34.170 --> 00:06:34.180
to innovate who is able to be
 

00:06:34.180 --> 00:06:35.310
to innovate who is able to be
resourceful in a number of different

00:06:35.310 --> 00:06:35.320
resourceful in a number of different
 

00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:37.530
resourceful in a number of different
ways by using all of these new tools and

00:06:37.530 --> 00:06:37.540
ways by using all of these new tools and
 

00:06:37.540 --> 00:06:41.670
ways by using all of these new tools and
forms of media so I think that maybe our

00:06:41.670 --> 00:06:41.680
forms of media so I think that maybe our
 

00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:44.190
forms of media so I think that maybe our
idea of a traditional journalist that is

00:06:44.190 --> 00:06:44.200
idea of a traditional journalist that is
 

00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:46.020
idea of a traditional journalist that is
less important now but the professional

00:06:46.020 --> 00:06:46.030
less important now but the professional
 

00:06:46.030 --> 00:06:48.260
less important now but the professional
journalist is more important than ever

00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:48.270
journalist is more important than ever
 

00:06:48.270 --> 00:06:50.250
journalist is more important than ever
another thing that we try to do to

00:06:50.250 --> 00:06:50.260
another thing that we try to do to
 

00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:52.290
another thing that we try to do to
address this on ground report is that we

00:06:52.290 --> 00:06:52.300
address this on ground report is that we
 

00:06:52.300 --> 00:06:54.210
address this on ground report is that we
distinguish between being a professional

00:06:54.210 --> 00:06:54.220
distinguish between being a professional
 

00:06:54.220 --> 00:06:56.940
distinguish between being a professional
journalist and being completely neutral

00:06:56.940 --> 00:06:56.950
journalist and being completely neutral
 

00:06:56.950 --> 00:06:59.460
journalist and being completely neutral
and objective and being perhaps a

00:06:59.460 --> 00:06:59.470
and objective and being perhaps a
 

00:06:59.470 --> 00:07:02.100
and objective and being perhaps a
citizen reporter a regular layman but

00:07:02.100 --> 00:07:02.110
citizen reporter a regular layman but
 

00:07:02.110 --> 00:07:04.380
citizen reporter a regular layman but
being very transparent about your views

00:07:04.380 --> 00:07:04.390
being very transparent about your views
 

00:07:04.390 --> 00:07:07.830
being very transparent about your views
so we're focusing more on transparency

all of the bloat and you're able to just

00:08:07.249 --> 00:08:07.259
all of the bloat and you're able to just
 

00:08:07.259 --> 00:08:09.589
all of the bloat and you're able to just
get rid of the overhead and focus on

00:08:09.589 --> 00:08:09.599
get rid of the overhead and focus on
 

00:08:09.599 --> 00:08:11.449
get rid of the overhead and focus on
people who are already there so we have

00:08:11.449 --> 00:08:11.459

scale that up and I think that if we can

scale that up and I think that if we can
 

00:08:20.009 --> 00:08:22.299
scale that up and I think that if we can
begin to build models that start with

sense

00:08:34.050 --> 00:08:34.060
 

00:08:34.060 --> 00:08:36.600
and I think that the ground reports

00:08:36.600 --> 00:08:36.610
and I think that the ground reports
 

00:08:36.610 --> 00:08:38.250

it took place and I and I noticed

because the reporter had put the
follow-up report on ground report and so

00:22:12.780 --> 00:22:12.790
follow-up report on ground report and so
 

00:22:12.790 --> 00:22:14.610
