00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:02.662
&gt;&gt; Hi, welcome to Introduction to Hadoop

00:00:02.662 --> 00:00:05.240
and MapReduce. I'm Sarah Sproehnle. I'm the Vice

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:08.039
President of Educational Services at Cloudera, the company

00:00:08.039 --> 00:00:10.350
that helps develop, support, and manage Apache Hadoop.

00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:15.210
&gt;&gt; And I'm Ian Wrigley. I'm Cloudera's Senior Curriculum Manager. Between us,

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:18.660
Sarah and I have been responsible for bringing Hadoop training to well

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:21.350
over 20,000 people, and we're excited to bring it to a much

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:24.150
larger audience with Udacity. So during

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:25.700
this course, we're going to talk about what

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:28.950
big data is, what Hadoop is, why Hadoop's useful,

00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:32.299
and we're going to teach you how to write MapReduce code.

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:34.760
&gt;&gt; In fact, by the end of the course, you'll write a MapReduce

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:38.240
program that efficiently processes a very large web server log. And by the

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:41.590
end of Lesson Two, you'll already be running a MapReduce job in Apache

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:45.840
Hadoop. So please join us to learn more about Apache Hadoop and MapReduce.
