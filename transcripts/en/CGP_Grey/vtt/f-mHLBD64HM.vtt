00:00:18.849 --> 00:00:22.229
Okay enough of that. This is not going to be a cinematic vlog here,

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:25.529
I'm just showing you what I've been up to lately and right now.

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:30.148
I need to get from London to Las Vegas and back again in 72 hours.

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:33.389
This is guaranteed to be a jet lag disaster

00:00:33.389 --> 00:00:40.320
But I have a plan. My body is going to Vegas but my sleep cycle is going to stay in London on

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:46.400
GMT - Grey Master Time. I'm changing continents, but not changing time zones

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:52.859
I think this is a great idea. Everyone I know thinks this is ridiculous, but I'm going to give it a shot let's go

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:10.560
What the heck is that?

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:17.199
Planes wander around on the runway for a long time so you always have to check and see when it is going to be real

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:22.869
It's real! Okay. This is future Grey here editing this video and who obviously survived the flight.

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:25.149
I'm not normally worried about the actual plane,

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:30.910
this is not where my travel anxieties come from, but look at the wing of this plane as it takes off.

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:35.590
It really bends quite a lot from the original position. Now, I have flown a bunch,

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:40.460
I don't remember ever seeing this kind of thing before, and I found it extremely

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:46.120
concerning. Normally, this is the exact moment where my travel anxieties end, once the plane is in the air

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:51.759
I can just sit back and read or work or whatever, and just feel like I have a bunch of time on my own.

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:57.250
But I couldn't help but keep looking at this wing and how much it bent. Is this normal?

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:02.980
It doesn't seem normal. Anyway, back to past Grey, who's actually on the plane.

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:04.330
The very vlog that I hope you're watching right now is something

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:07.990
I'm thinking of trying to do on this trip as like an additional thing

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:10.959
But I got to tell you this wing outside the plane is

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:14.379
Extremely concerning. Like, it's not just me, right? It's really bent

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:18.610
Okay, I've been working on the vlog for a little while, but if this plan is going to work

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:23.580
I need to get to sleep because there's only six and a half hours of flight time remaining

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:29.580
It's noon o'clock in Las Vegas and eight o'clock in London which is a little early, but I've brought sleeping pills of unconsciousness

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:33.020
They're blue, as all such pills are legally required to be

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.220
Oh god, it's really early.

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:59.960
Alright. I've gotta get up. I'll make make up some sleep in the hotel.

00:03:16.519 --> 00:03:21.188
Traveling into the U.S. sucks. This is where I protect my phone. This is where I protect myself.

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:37.849
Vegas, baby.

00:03:37.849 --> 00:03:40.749
Alright, it took me way longer to get through the airport than I was expecting.

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:45.060
It's almost 4:00 in the morning in London, but it's almost 8:00 p.m.

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:46.160
in Las Vegas

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:53.100
and I wanted to sleep a little bit when I got in, but I don't have time because I have a dinner to get to at

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:57.700
8:30. Okay, future Grey here. I did make it to the dinner on time, but I didn't film it

00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:01.869
So here's some stock footage of puppies instead, and now that we're taking this little break

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:05.560
I'm going to let past Grey explain exactly what the plan is, in detail

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:10.389
Let's take a look at London and let's take a look at Las Vegas. 1:00 a.m. in London is 5:00 p.m.

00:04:10.389 --> 00:04:16.059
in Las Vegas. Drawing out the rest of the hours gets us at this relationship between the times. Around 10 o'clock

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:21.849
I am definitely asleep, which, expanding to eight hours later, gets us to around 6:00 in the morning, when I'm usually

00:04:22.159 --> 00:04:26.709
waking up. This means in Las Vegas, I'm going to be asleep from about 2:00 in the afternoon until

00:04:27.229 --> 00:04:32.979
10:00 p.m.. My 8 or 9 o'clock at night is still lunch time for people in Las Vegas

00:04:32.979 --> 00:04:37.509
So I'm definitely available then but if I'm willing to take away 2 hours of sleep

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:41.109
I can actually make it for the time when most people want to have dinner,

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:46.030
which is 8 o'clock at night. Normally that's my nightmare; having dinner at 8:00;

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:50.289
But this time, it's working in my favor. Crazy normal people like to stay up until midnight,

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:54.849
which I could never possibly do, but now this is looking like a real possibility.

00:04:55.190 --> 00:05:01.779
Their midnight is just my 8 in the morning at which, I've already been awake for 3 hours anyway on London time.

00:05:01.909 --> 00:05:08.409
So there's a big overlap during this section even better when they go to bed it means I have the rest of a full

00:05:08.659 --> 00:05:14.109
Working day essentially on my own. No one's going to be around at 4 a.m. in Las Vegas,

00:05:14.109 --> 00:05:18.960
[I] can just be doing whatever I want. It's my lunchtime normal business hours start at 9:00 a.m.

00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:24.720
Which is my 5:00 in the afternoon. So as far as I'm concerned, this actually works perfectly.

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:28.940
I can see people in the beginning of the work day. I can meet people for their lunch

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:31.070
I can be around for people's dinners

00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:35.989
And I actually get to be the guy who can stay up late for post-dinner socializing, a first in my life

00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:40.970
And I get a whole chunk of time to myself. I don't see how it could possibly go wrong

00:05:41.130 --> 00:05:45.950
the only thing I need to do is just make sure I don't fall asleep at the wrong time

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:49.909
Dinner over which was my breakfast. I'm pretty tired, but it's

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:53.900
10:40 a.m.. On Grey Master Time I can't fall asleep

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:58.190
I'm going out for a walk to actually see Vegas for a little bit

00:05:58.470 --> 00:06:03.230
Vegas really is the city where I think this plan can work because if there's one place that

00:06:03.420 --> 00:06:09.319
doesn't want you to know what time it really is, its Las Vegas. The walk helped, now

00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:13.999
it's time to take advantage of everybody being asleep, but I need to find

00:06:14.820 --> 00:06:16.290
bingo

00:06:16.290 --> 00:06:21.740
Target acquired time to return to home base and edit an episode of Hello Internet.

00:06:57.280 --> 00:06:59.280
The funny set up, but it works

00:07:00.190 --> 00:07:06.330
Alright. I'm getting pretty tired when I shouldn't be so I'm just standing in the sun for a while to remind my brain to stay

00:07:06.330 --> 00:07:09.960
Awake before heading off to meet some people for breakfast and then lunch

00:07:09.960 --> 00:07:15.479
But I didn't film that so here's a sleepy hedgehog instead. Alright, it's 9:30 in London even though

00:07:15.480 --> 00:07:17.789
it's only 1:30 in Las Vegas and I am

00:07:18.610 --> 00:07:20.490
Exhausted, it's been a long day

00:07:20.490 --> 00:07:25.109
I've lost more sleep than I expected because of the flight and the time it took to get to the airport

00:07:25.270 --> 00:07:30.539
But at least one day has been successfully accomplished, but now I am going to bed

00:07:35.770 --> 00:07:40.889
Okay this is the first time that I'm waking up actually according to the schedule so far so good

00:07:40.890 --> 00:07:45.599
I have a 9:30 dinner that I need to go catch. Which is actually going to be my breakfast

00:07:46.450 --> 00:07:50.520
You know the drill people stayed up until way late this time

00:07:50.710 --> 00:07:56.789
I'm never the guy who gets to close down a party because I'm mister in my pajamas at 8 p.m.

00:07:56.790 --> 00:08:01.439
But now the tables have turned and I can be the last one who stays awake

00:08:01.440 --> 00:08:03.540
I have the whole day ahead of me

00:08:03.880 --> 00:08:08.640
But I'm skipping to the end because I don't want to spend my whole day filming things, but I saw a big shoe

00:08:08.640 --> 00:08:10.640
I saw some robots taking her job

00:08:12.520 --> 00:08:16.020
Took a car, met some people for their lunch and my dinner

00:08:16.320 --> 00:08:21.380
and now I need to go to bed pretty quick because I need to wake up earlier to catch a final dinner here.

00:08:21.800 --> 00:08:22.820
*GROAN*

00:08:23.480 --> 00:08:27.020
The first few minutes of waking up are not great normally,

00:08:27.030 --> 00:08:30.539
But when you have to wake up just a little bit earlier, It makes a big difference

00:08:31.210 --> 00:08:33.810
But I know just just get into the shower

00:08:33.810 --> 00:08:39.119
and get going. I was a little bit late and a little bit lost trying to find my way to dinner

00:08:39.120 --> 00:08:41.159
But boy, was it worth it.

00:08:41.919 --> 00:08:48.359
My steak for dinner breakfast is over and this is my last morning in Las Vegas, and there's something I want to do

00:08:48.820 --> 00:08:51.209
What is the vlog without a montage?

00:08:51.610 --> 00:08:57.450
So I'm grabbing a car to the other end of the strip and I'm going to film my way back as the sun rises

00:08:58.120 --> 00:09:00.120
Walk with me

00:11:46.900 --> 00:11:48.780
It has been a pretty great time in Vegas

00:11:48.820 --> 00:11:51.920
I spent the rest of the day just packing and getting ready to go which is

00:11:52.250 --> 00:11:58.990
Totally uninteresting and now I'm setting my alarm and a timer because I have to get up very early

00:11:59.330 --> 00:12:01.330
To catch the flight home

00:12:01.610 --> 00:12:07.209
Future Grey here because past Grey didn't have a whole lot of time between when he woke up, when he had to get in the

00:12:07.210 --> 00:12:10.900
car and when he had to get to the airport. It wasn't close close

00:12:10.900 --> 00:12:16.509
But it was a lot closer than I would normally cut these kind of things the flight was at Las Vegas 10 p.m.

00:12:16.510 --> 00:12:18.520
Time which was London 6 a.m.

00:12:18.520 --> 00:12:22.960
Time and this flight home turned out to be the hardest part of maintaining Grey

00:12:23.210 --> 00:12:27.939
Master Time this was a night flight back all of the lights were turned off

00:12:27.940 --> 00:12:32.860
I was darkness the entire time the plane was in the air for what had been 7 a.m.

00:12:32.860 --> 00:12:35.560
For me, but I had already been up since about 3:00 a.m.

00:12:35.600 --> 00:12:39.969
Getting ready to go to the airport and boy did I want to sleep

00:12:40.100 --> 00:12:45.430
To make matters worse the power in my seat didn't work for the vast majority of the flight

00:12:45.430 --> 00:12:47.649
So I was just counting down the time

00:12:47.650 --> 00:12:49.300
I had left on my laptop

00:12:49.300 --> 00:12:55.410
To work to give me something productive to do instead of just sitting there in the darkness trying not to fall asleep

00:12:55.540 --> 00:13:01.700
But thankfully the nice flight attendants kept bringing me many many cups of coffee and eventually got the power

00:13:01.720 --> 00:13:03.180
in the seat next to mine

00:13:03.180 --> 00:13:05.740
working so that I could keep doing stuff.

00:13:05.800 --> 00:13:08.780
The sun did come up which really helped

00:13:08.780 --> 00:13:10.660
And then we flew above the clouds for quite a while and

00:13:12.480 --> 00:13:17.140
Nine hours later descended through them into the ever bright and beautiful England

00:13:17.140 --> 00:13:19.080
then back through a much easier security,

00:13:19.080 --> 00:13:23.300
trains, and eventually home to a normal day where I could go to bed

00:13:23.470 --> 00:13:28.109
Where I was going to wake up the next morning to see if this test was successful

00:13:28.840 --> 00:13:34.290
Was I able to go to Las Vegas and come back without disrupting my regular sleep cycle?

00:13:42.400 --> 00:13:45.200
Woke up to a foggy London this morning.

00:13:46.400 --> 00:13:52.260
I know people think the city always looks like this, but in my time living here it rarely does

00:13:52.840 --> 00:13:56.819
So I always try to appreciate a good fog when it comes in. I'm a little tired

00:13:56.890 --> 00:14:02.670
which is to be expected given that I've cut at least two hours of sleep off each night for the past three days

00:14:02.980 --> 00:14:04.980
but the very fact that I am

00:14:05.320 --> 00:14:09.460
Awake in London at this time in the morning after coming back from America

00:14:11.760 --> 00:14:13.200
It feels like a miracle

00:14:14.110 --> 00:14:18.330
Normally when I come back from America, I sleep in really late, I feel really terrible

00:14:18.490 --> 00:14:22.229
I'm just jet-lagged and I'm totally unproductive for a week

00:14:22.570 --> 00:14:25.379
but right now the plan is to head into a cafe and

00:14:25.570 --> 00:14:30.749
Work on one of the final drafts for the next video that's going up. That's a huge relief that

00:14:31.300 --> 00:14:34.979
this trip didn't destroy a week's worth of productivity and

00:14:35.680 --> 00:14:37.020
I don't know if I'll do it

00:14:37.020 --> 00:14:41.639
But I feel like it opens up the possibility of doing shorter trips to America in the future. We'll see

00:14:42.520 --> 00:14:47.609
As for this vlog that you may or may not be watching I don't know if I'm going to finish it

00:14:47.610 --> 00:14:51.000
I don't know if I do finish it if I'll put it up on the channel and

00:14:51.700 --> 00:14:55.530
In particular, I don't know if I put it up on the channel that people will like it

00:14:56.170 --> 00:14:56.940
but for now

00:14:56.940 --> 00:15:00.780
It's been at least an interesting fun side project to have

00:15:01.209 --> 00:15:07.409
That's like a little bit of a secret which you dear potential future viewer may or may not be in on

00:15:07.930 --> 00:15:11.130
But right now. I'm going to enjoy the rest of this beautiful morning
