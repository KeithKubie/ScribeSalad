 With 80% of infectious diseases transmitted by hands, it is clear that they are washed 

00:00:04.279 --> 00:00:08.919
 Important. However, when it comes to hygiene and health, no drying methods 

00:00:08.919 --> 00:00:12.709
 Best? Use classic tissue paper, or electric dryer 

00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:16.369
 Well, let's learn that if you wash your hands well with soap, almost 

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:21.300
 All traces of bacteria will be eliminated, regardless of how they are dried. but when 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:25.720
 Do not wash them well, or worse, just wash them with water, then the way to dry your hands, it is possible to make a big difference 

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:30.099
 In the end, the spread of bacteria is possible to occur in 

00:00:30.099 --> 00:00:34.780
 If the skin is wet, wipe your hands with your clothes or touch the bathroom door 

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:35.699
 Of their pollution 

00:00:35.699 --> 00:00:40.230
 After comparing and analyzing several studies, the tissue was shown 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:45.269
 She won. Why? This is due to the timing. The air-conditioner needs an average 

00:00:45.269 --> 00:00:50.640
 45 seconds to reduce hand moisture by 97%, while paper tissues achieve the same result 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:55.149
 In about 10 seconds. But by reviewing the behavior of people, studies showed 

00:00:55.149 --> 00:00:59.879
 Most people spend only 22 seconds to use the electric air dryer, which reduces 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:05.680
 70% drought. We find tissue paper users on the other side, achieving 85% drying 

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:07.440
 In just 5 seconds 

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:11.480
 Friction also plays a major role in the removal of bacteria, where a large group of them move 

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:15.940
 For napkins. In contrast, some studies have shown that the electric air dryer has 

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:20.480
 Contributes to the transmission of bacteria, due to contaminated air in the bathroom. And we say this 

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:25.020
 Drying the hands with the air dryer may be effective if done well, accurate, 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:28.560
 You do not always have the option! Although some dryers are better than others, just make sure 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:31.140
 To dry your hands fully, and promise not to face any problem. 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:35.070
 What about the environment, you wonder? The new dryers are friendly 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:39.440
 They use less energy 

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:44.290
 Low in carbon emission and if taken into account 

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:49.200
 That 13 billion pounds of tissue paper is used in America alone, which is considered 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:50.370
 A big dilemma in itself. 

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:54.670
 If you want to use tissue paper, here's a quick tip for using one piece 

00:01:54.670 --> 00:02:00.100
 As counsel Joe Smith suggested. After washing your hands, shake them 12 times, 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:05.140
 Then fold the paper in half, and wipe your hands. This is the best way 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:11.000
 To dry them with the greatest amount of napkins. Again, shake your hands 12 times ... Fold and dry 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.540
 Now you have two clean, dry hands, with the least amount of waste.
