the dog community would be a bit

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480
the dog community would be a bit
 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:36.799
the dog community would be a bit
irritated by that sort of contention but

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809
irritated by that sort of contention but
 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:39.889
irritated by that sort of contention but
nevertheless um I think it's fair to say

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899
nevertheless um I think it's fair to say
 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:42.290
nevertheless um I think it's fair to say
that chemistry is natural subject I mean

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300
that chemistry is natural subject I mean

the great breakthroughs with that we

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340
the great breakthroughs with that we
 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:48.260
the great breakthroughs with that we
understand what a bond is ok you know

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270

that knowing Fineman said that the most
important thing to be passed on to other

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879
important thing to be passed on to other
 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:56.389
important thing to be passed on to other
generations if all other knowledge has

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399
generations if all other knowledge has
 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:57.979
generations if all other knowledge has
been lost was that there are little

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989
been lost was that there are little
 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:00.290

things called atoms and at long

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300
things called atoms and at long
 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.270
things called atoms and at long
distances they attracted in a short

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280
distances they attracted in a short
 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.490
distances they attracted in a short
distance they repelled and into nuclear

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500
distance they repelled and into nuclear
 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.940
distance they repelled and into nuclear
reaction went to separated atoms and so

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950
reaction went to separated atoms and so
 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:10.250
reaction went to separated atoms and so
that's the potential curve that's

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260
that's the potential curve that's
 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:15.469
that's the potential curve that's
chemistry and so it's downhill a bit

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479
chemistry and so it's downhill a bit
 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:18.080
chemistry and so it's downhill a bit
from their own because chemistry is that

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090
from their own because chemistry is that
 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:21.469
from their own because chemistry is that
we are all made of these things um and

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479
we are all made of these things um and
 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:27.140
we are all made of these things um and
then Dalton put together the conclusion

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150
then Dalton put together the conclusion
 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:31.550
then Dalton put together the conclusion
now atoms existed and then basically

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560
now atoms existed and then basically
 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:37.280
now atoms existed and then basically
chemistry started then there are

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290
chemistry started then there are
 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:39.469
chemistry started then there are
exciting breakthroughs with benzene

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479
exciting breakthroughs with benzene
 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:42.830
exciting breakthroughs with benzene
things of this nature structure you know

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840
things of this nature structure you know
 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.679
things of this nature structure you know
and then i would say that DNA is a

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689
and then i would say that DNA is a
 

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:48.670
and then i would say that DNA is a
molecule as well and so that's chemistry

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:48.680
molecule as well and so that's chemistry
 

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:52.670
molecule as well and so that's chemistry
we could the discovery of DNA could

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680
we could the discovery of DNA could
 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:56.270
we could the discovery of DNA could
quite easily have been a chemistry nobel

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280
quite easily have been a chemistry nobel
 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:00.020
quite easily have been a chemistry nobel
prize indeed hemoglobin which is also a

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030
prize indeed hemoglobin which is also a
 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:04.639
prize indeed hemoglobin which is also a
big biological molecule was a chemistry

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649
big biological molecule was a chemistry
 

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:11.900
big biological molecule was a chemistry
prize of max per us and and so we move

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910
prize of max per us and and so we move
 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:12.450
prize of max per us and and so we move
on

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:12.460
on
 

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:15.050
on
we realize that chemistry is sort of

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:15.060
we realize that chemistry is sort of
 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:18.390
we realize that chemistry is sort of
subject and other overarching subject

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:18.400
subject and other overarching subject
 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:24.260
subject and other overarching subject
which now has major impact and in

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:24.270
which now has major impact and in
 

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:27.150
which now has major impact and in
material science in condensed matter

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:27.160
material science in condensed matter
 

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:30.540
material science in condensed matter
physics and in molecular biology and i

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:30.550
physics and in molecular biology and i
 

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:32.900
physics and in molecular biology and i
think one problem is that chemistry is

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:32.910
think one problem is that chemistry is
 

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:35.990
think one problem is that chemistry is
losing out there because it is chemistry

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:36.000
losing out there because it is chemistry
 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.450
losing out there because it is chemistry
but the cutting-edge chemistry now is

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:39.460
but the cutting-edge chemistry now is
 

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:43.260
but the cutting-edge chemistry now is
being subsumed into other areas and I

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:43.270
being subsumed into other areas and I
 

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:46.260
being subsumed into other areas and I
felt for quite a while now that the

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:46.270
felt for quite a while now that the
 

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:49.110
felt for quite a while now that the
traditional structure of universities is

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:49.120
traditional structure of universities is
 

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:53.840
traditional structure of universities is
counterproductive and that instead of

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:53.850
counterproductive and that instead of
 

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:57.180
counterproductive and that instead of
basically chemistry panton physics

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:57.190
basically chemistry panton physics
 

00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:00.420
basically chemistry panton physics
departments and engineering with bombs

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:00.430
departments and engineering with bombs
 

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:03.170
departments and engineering with bombs
there should be departments in which

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:03.180
there should be departments in which
 

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:05.790
there should be departments in which
basically nanotechnology which is

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:05.800
basically nanotechnology which is
 

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:10.050
basically nanotechnology which is
chemistry of the 21st century is being

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:10.060
chemistry of the 21st century is being
 

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:12.780
chemistry of the 21st century is being
carried out and so I think there's a

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:12.790
carried out and so I think there's a
 

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:15.990
carried out and so I think there's a
valid point here and I I think it this

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:16.000
valid point here and I I think it this
 

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.350
valid point here and I I think it this
presents a problem in education because

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:19.360
presents a problem in education because
 

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:22.020
presents a problem in education because
I think people who run universities and

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:22.030
I think people who run universities and
 

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:25.550
I think people who run universities and
government don't really appreciate that

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:25.560
government don't really appreciate that
 

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:29.360
government don't really appreciate that
they see the cutting edge advances in

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:29.370
they see the cutting edge advances in
 

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:31.920
they see the cutting edge advances in
condensed matter physics and this that

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:31.930
condensed matter physics and this that
 

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:34.050
condensed matter physics and this that
the older nanotechnology or molecular

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:34.060
the older nanotechnology or molecular
 

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:38.670

biology or in materials engineering and
 

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:40.710

don't realize that it's chemistry and I

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:40.720
don't realize that it's chemistry and I
 

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:43.380
don't realize that it's chemistry and I
think that will present a problem in the

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:43.390
think that will present a problem in the
 

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:46.320
think that will present a problem in the
future because people going into these

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:46.330
future because people going into these
 

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:48.390
future because people going into these
areas will have very poor chemical

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:48.400
areas will have very poor chemical
 

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:50.940
areas will have very poor chemical
understanding and and chemistry is a

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:50.950
understanding and and chemistry is a
 

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:54.330
understanding and and chemistry is a
very rather unusual subject I think in

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:54.340
very rather unusual subject I think in
 

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:58.980
very rather unusual subject I think in
that it's very complex systems that we

00:03:58.980 --> 00:03:58.990
that it's very complex systems that we
 

00:03:58.990 --> 00:04:03.270
that it's very complex systems that we
make work we may not know exactly all

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:03.280
make work we may not know exactly all
 

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:06.060
make work we may not know exactly all
the details of a chemical reaction but

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:06.070
the details of a chemical reaction but
 

00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:08.910
the details of a chemical reaction but
we know that if we heat it up or we slow

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:08.920
we know that if we heat it up or we slow
 

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:10.980
we know that if we heat it up or we slow
it down by cooling or we add a bit of

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:10.990
it down by cooling or we add a bit of
 

00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:12.900
it down by cooling or we add a bit of
this and now that we can move it in a

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:12.910
this and now that we can move it in a
 

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:15.020
this and now that we can move it in a
certain direction we have some rough

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:15.030
certain direction we have some rough
 

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:18.570
certain direction we have some rough
theory theoretical feel of how things

theory theoretical feel of how things
 

00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:20.789
theory theoretical feel of how things
are operating and then we we put a

00:04:20.789 --> 00:04:20.799
are operating and then we we put a
 

00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:22.009
are operating and then we we put a
chlorine in or

00:04:22.009 --> 00:04:22.019
chlorine in or
 

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:24.140
chlorine in or
meaning the electronegativity and things

meaning the electronegativity and things
that I this nature and we skew the

that I this nature and we skew the
 

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:32.140
that I this nature and we skew the
process to the way we want it and so

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:32.150
process to the way we want it and so
 

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:36.350
process to the way we want it and so
Vice Chancellors at universities seem to

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:36.360
Vice Chancellors at universities seem to
 

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:38.749
Vice Chancellors at universities seem to
think that they can do science without

00:04:38.749 --> 00:04:38.759
think that they can do science without
 

00:04:38.759 --> 00:04:40.640
think that they can do science without
chemistry and that's just ridiculous

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:40.650
chemistry and that's just ridiculous
 

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:44.080
chemistry and that's just ridiculous
because I think chemistry is now

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:44.090
because I think chemistry is now
 

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:47.330
because I think chemistry is now
chemistry grounding is more important

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:47.340
chemistry grounding is more important
 

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:49.580
chemistry grounding is more important
today than it ever has been and I think

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:49.590
today than it ever has been and I think
 

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:53.420
today than it ever has been and I think
that if universities Cup chemistry

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:53.430
that if universities Cup chemistry
 

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:57.909
that if universities Cup chemistry
departments that some have done this is

00:04:57.909 --> 00:04:57.919
departments that some have done this is
 

00:04:57.919 --> 00:05:01.430
