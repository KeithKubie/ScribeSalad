00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:03.140
What I want to do in this video
is use some of the results from

00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:05.960
the last several videos to
do some pretty neat things.

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:10.000
So let's say this is a circle,
and I have an inscribed

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.130
equilateral triangle
in this circle.

00:00:12.130 --> 00:00:17.340
So all the vertices of
this triangle sit on the

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:18.825
circumference of the circle.

00:00:18.825 --> 00:00:24.170
So I'm going to try my best to
draw an equilateral triangle.

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:26.960
I think that's about as good as
I'm going to be able to do.

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:28.620
And when I say equilateral
that means all of these

00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:29.910
sides are the same length.

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:33.060
So if this is side length a,
then this is side length a,

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:36.610
and that is also a
side of length a.

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:44.010
And let's say we know that the
radius of this circle is 2.

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:45.925
I'm just picking a number,
just to do this problem.

00:00:45.925 --> 00:00:49.600
So let's say the radius
of this circle is 2.

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:51.700
So from the center to the
circumference at any

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:55.910
point, this distance, the
radius, is equal to 2.

00:00:55.910 --> 00:01:01.780
Now, what I'm going to ask you
is using some of the results of

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:04.020
the last few videos and a
little bit of basic

00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:06.940
trigonometry-- and if the word
"trigonometry" scares you,

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:09.570
you'll just need to know maybe
the first two or three videos

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:11.710
in the trigonometry playlist to
be able to understand

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:12.840
what I do here.

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:18.830
What I want to do is figure out
the area of the region inside

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:21.080
the circle and outside
of the triangle.

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:25.690
So I want to figure out the
area of that little space, that

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:30.940
space, and this space combined.

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:33.490
So the obvious way to do
this is to say, well I can

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:36.670
figure out the area of
the circle pretty easily.

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:40.215
Area of the circle.

00:01:40.215 --> 00:01:43.740
And that's going to be
equal to pi r squared.

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:48.840
Or pi times 2 squared,
which is equal to 4 pi.

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:53.040
And I could subtract from 4
pi the area of the triangle.

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:55.450
So we need to figure out
the area of the triangle.

00:01:55.450 --> 00:02:00.760
What is the area
of the triangle?

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:07.260
Well, from several videos ago I
showed you Heron's formula,

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:10.720
where if you know the lengths
of the sides of a triangle

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:12.070
you can figure out the area.

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:14.180
But we don't know the lengths
of the sides just yet.

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:16.560
Once we do maybe we can
figure out the area.

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:18.740
Let me apply Heron's
formula not knowing it.

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:21.950
So let me just say that the
lengths of this equilateral--

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:23.760
the lengths of the
sides-- are a.

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:31.450
Applying Heron's formula, we
first define our variable

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:38.220
s as being equal to a
plus a plus a, over 2.

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:42.070
Or that's the same
thing as 3a over 2.

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:46.380
And then the area of this
triangle, in terms of a.

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:52.910
So the area is going to be
equal to the square root of

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:59.310
s, which is 3a over
2, times s minus a.

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:03.820
So that's 3a over 2 minus a.

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:07.060
Or I could just
write, 2a over 2.

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:08.970
Right? a is the same
thing as 2a over 2.

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:10.740
You could cancel
those out and get a.

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:13.170
And then I'm going to
do that three times.

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:16.000
So instead of just multiplying
that out three times for each

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.640
of the sides, by Heron's
formula I could just say

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:20.700
to the third power.

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:22.000
So what's this going
to be equal to?

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:31.050
This is going to be equal to
the square root of 3a over 2.

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:34.070
And then this right here
is going to be equal

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:36.810
to 3a minus 2a, is a.

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:42.010
So a/2 to the third power.

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:44.860
And so this is going to be
equal to-- I'll arbitrarily

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:46.490
switch colors.

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:53.560
We have 3a times a to the
third, which is 3a to the

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:58.170
fourth, over 2 times
2 to the third.

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:03.400
Well that's 2 to the
fourth power, or 16.

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:03.680
Right?

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:07.100
2 times 2 to the third
is 2 to the fourth.

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:07.890
That's 16.

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:10.660
And then if we take the square
root of the numerator and the

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:14.150
denominator, this is going to
be equal to the square root of

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:16.690
a to the fourth is a squared.

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:21.390
a squared times, well I'll just
write the square root of 3,

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:24.860
over the square root of the
denominator, which is just 4.

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:30.130
So if we know a, using Heron's
formula we know what the area

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:32.720
of this equilateral
triangle is.

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:35.080
So how can we figure out a?

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:37.770
So what else do we know about
equilateral triangles?

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:42.690
Well we know that all of
these angles are equal.

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:45.720
And since they must add
up to 180 degrees, they

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:48.210
all must be 60 degrees.

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:51.890
That's 60 degrees,
that's 60 degrees, and

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:54.090
that is 60 degrees.

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:56.980
Now let's see if we can use the
last video, where I talked

00:04:56.980 --> 00:05:01.720
about the relationship
between an inscribed angle

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:02.800
and a central angle.

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:04.560
So this is an inscribed
angle right here.

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:09.620
It's vertex is sitting
on the circumference.

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:16.630
And so it is subtending
this arc right here.

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:25.000
And the central angle that
is subtending that same arc

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:26.330
is this one right here.

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:33.740
The central angles subtending
that same arc is that

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:34.960
one right there.

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:39.170
So based on what we saw in the
last video, the central angle

00:05:39.170 --> 00:05:41.980
that subtends the same arc is
going to be double of

00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:43.040
the inscribed angle.

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:47.230
So this angle right here is
going to be 120 degrees.

00:05:47.230 --> 00:05:48.860
Let me just put an arrow there.

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:50.860
120 degrees.

00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:52.440
It's double of that one.

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:56.110
Now, if I were to exactly
bisect this angle right here.

00:05:56.110 --> 00:05:58.140
So I go halfway through the
angle, and I want to just go

00:05:58.140 --> 00:06:01.260
straight down like that.

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:03.310
What are these two
angles going to be?

00:06:03.310 --> 00:06:04.440
Well, they're going
to be 60 degrees.

00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:05.760
I'm bisecting that angle.

00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:10.480
That is 60 degrees, and that
is 60 degrees right there.

00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:14.450
And we know that I'm
splitting this side in two.

00:06:14.450 --> 00:06:17.080
This is an isosceles triangle.

00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:19.040
This is a radius right here.

00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:21.030
Radius r is equal to 2.

00:06:21.030 --> 00:06:24.530
This is a radius right
here of r is equal to 2.

00:06:24.530 --> 00:06:26.090
So this whole triangle
is symmetric.

00:06:26.090 --> 00:06:28.540
If I go straight down the
middle, this length right

00:06:28.540 --> 00:06:33.100
here is going to be
that side divided by 2.

00:06:33.100 --> 00:06:36.280
That side right there is going
to be that side divided by 2.

00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:37.240
Let me draw that over here.

00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:39.890
If I just take an isosceles
triangle, any isosceles

00:06:39.890 --> 00:06:44.850
triangle, where this side is
equivalent to that side.

00:06:44.850 --> 00:06:47.300
Those are our radiuses
in this example.

00:06:47.300 --> 00:06:49.530
And this angle is going to
be equal to that angle.

00:06:49.530 --> 00:06:51.790
If I were to just go straight
down this angle right

00:06:51.790 --> 00:06:55.260
here, I would split that
opposite side in two.

00:06:55.260 --> 00:06:56.880
So these two lengths
are going to be equal.

00:06:56.880 --> 00:06:59.120
In this case if the whole
thing is a, each of these

00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:01.140
are going to be a/2.

00:07:01.140 --> 00:07:04.420
Now, let's see if we can use
this and a little bit of

00:07:04.420 --> 00:07:08.620
trigonometry to find the
relationship between a and r.

00:07:08.620 --> 00:07:12.050
Because if we're able to solve
for a using r, then we can then

00:07:12.050 --> 00:07:14.640
put that value of a in here and
we'll get the area

00:07:14.640 --> 00:07:15.690
of our triangle.

00:07:15.690 --> 00:07:17.600
And then we could subtract
that from the area of the

00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:20.070
circle, and we're done.

00:07:20.070 --> 00:07:22.050
We will have solved
the problem.

00:07:22.050 --> 00:07:24.610
So let's see if we can do that.

00:07:24.610 --> 00:07:29.340
So we have an angle
here of 60 degrees.

00:07:29.340 --> 00:07:32.050
Half of this whole central
angle right there.

00:07:32.050 --> 00:07:35.890
If this angle is 60 degrees,
we have a/2 that's

00:07:35.890 --> 00:07:37.380
opposite to this angle.

00:07:37.380 --> 00:07:43.480
So we have an opposite
is equal to a/2.

00:07:43.480 --> 00:07:44.860
And we also have
the hypotenuse.

00:07:44.860 --> 00:07:45.040
Right?

00:07:45.040 --> 00:07:46.870
This is a right
triangle right here.

00:07:46.870 --> 00:07:49.830
You're just going straight
down, and you're bisecting

00:07:49.830 --> 00:07:50.840
that opposite side.

00:07:50.840 --> 00:07:52.640
This is a right triangle.

00:07:52.640 --> 00:07:54.000
So we can do a little
trigonometry.

00:07:54.000 --> 00:08:02.550
Our opposite is a/2, the
hypotenuse is equal to r.

00:08:02.550 --> 00:08:05.020
This is the hypotenuse, right
here, of our right triangle.

00:08:05.020 --> 00:08:06.360
So that is equal to 2.

00:08:06.360 --> 00:08:12.440
So what trig ratio is the
ratio of an angle's opposite

00:08:12.440 --> 00:08:14.920
side to hypotenuse?

00:08:14.920 --> 00:08:18.910
So some of you all might get
tired of me doing this all

00:08:18.910 --> 00:08:22.030
the time, but SOH CAH TOA.

00:08:22.030 --> 00:08:27.070
SOH-- sin of an angle is
equal to the opposite

00:08:27.070 --> 00:08:28.620
over the hypotenuse.

00:08:28.620 --> 00:08:29.580
So let me scroll
down a little bit.

00:08:29.580 --> 00:08:31.270
I'm running out of space.

00:08:31.270 --> 00:08:38.700
So the sin of this angle right
here, the sin of 60 degrees, is

00:08:38.700 --> 00:08:42.070
going to be equal to the
opposite side, is going to be

00:08:42.070 --> 00:08:45.800
equal to a/2, over the
hypotenuse, which is

00:08:45.800 --> 00:08:48.140
our radius-- over 2.

00:08:48.140 --> 00:08:54.510
Which is equal to a/2
divided by 2 is a/4.

00:08:54.510 --> 00:08:56.880
And what is sin of 60 degrees?

00:08:56.880 --> 00:08:59.720
And if the word "sin" looks
completely foreign to you,

00:08:59.720 --> 00:09:04.150
watch the first several videos
on the trigonometry playlist.

00:09:04.150 --> 00:09:06.240
It shouldn't be too daunting.

00:09:06.240 --> 00:09:08.310
sin of 60 degrees you
might remember from your

00:09:08.310 --> 00:09:10.680
30-60-90 triangles.

00:09:10.680 --> 00:09:13.210
So let me draw one right there.

00:09:13.210 --> 00:09:15.705
So that is a 30-60-90 triangle.

00:09:15.705 --> 00:09:21.540
If this is 60 degrees, that
is 30 degrees, that is 90.

00:09:21.540 --> 00:09:26.660
You might remember that this is
of length 1, this is going to

00:09:26.660 --> 00:09:29.520
be of length 1/2, and this
is going to be of length

00:09:29.520 --> 00:09:31.370
square root of 3 over 2.

00:09:31.370 --> 00:09:35.300
So the sin of 60 degrees is
opposite over hypotenuse.

00:09:35.300 --> 00:09:37.770
Square root of 3 over 2 over 1.

00:09:37.770 --> 00:09:40.940
sin of 60 degrees.

00:09:40.940 --> 00:09:42.840
If you don't have a calculator,
you could just use this--

00:09:42.840 --> 00:09:44.930
is square root of 3 over 2.

00:09:44.930 --> 00:09:48.890
So this right here is
square root of 3 over 2.

00:09:48.890 --> 00:09:51.280
Now we can solve for a.

00:09:51.280 --> 00:09:56.920
Square root of 3 over
2 is equal to a/4.

00:09:56.920 --> 00:09:59.610
Let's multiply both sides by 4.

00:09:59.610 --> 00:10:01.640
So you get this 4 cancels out.

00:10:01.640 --> 00:10:03.445
You multiply 4 here.

00:10:03.445 --> 00:10:04.480
This becomes a 2.

00:10:04.480 --> 00:10:05.660
This becomes a 1.

00:10:05.660 --> 00:10:09.250
You get a is equal to
2 square roots of 3.

00:10:09.250 --> 00:10:11.000
We're in the home stretch.

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:15.420
We just figured out the length
of each of these sides.

00:10:15.420 --> 00:10:17.460
We used Heron's formula to
figure out the area of the

00:10:17.460 --> 00:10:19.080
triangle in terms
of those lengths.

00:10:19.080 --> 00:10:22.110
So we just substitute this
value of a into there

00:10:22.110 --> 00:10:24.670
to get our actual area.

00:10:24.670 --> 00:10:30.380
So our triangle's area
is equal to a squared.

00:10:30.380 --> 00:10:31.690
What's a squared?

00:10:31.690 --> 00:10:37.780
That is 2 square roots
of 3 squared, times the

00:10:37.780 --> 00:10:42.710
square root of 3 over 4.

00:10:42.710 --> 00:10:45.470
We just did a squared times
the square root of 3 over 4.

00:10:45.470 --> 00:10:51.950
This is going to be equal
to 4 times 3 times the

00:10:51.950 --> 00:10:53.930
square of 3 over 4.

00:10:53.930 --> 00:10:55.350
These 4's cancel.

00:10:55.350 --> 00:10:58.360
So the area of our triangle
we got is 3 times the

00:10:58.360 --> 00:11:00.770
square root of 3.

00:11:00.770 --> 00:11:03.160
So the area here is 3
square roots of 3.

00:11:03.160 --> 00:11:06.480
That's the area of
this entire triangle.

00:11:06.480 --> 00:11:08.810
Now, to go back to what this
question was all about.

00:11:08.810 --> 00:11:12.970
The area of this orange area
outside of the triangle

00:11:12.970 --> 00:11:14.530
and inside of the circle.

00:11:14.530 --> 00:11:18.460
Well, the area of
our circle is 4 pi.

00:11:18.460 --> 00:11:23.340
And from that we subtract
the area of the triangle,

00:11:23.340 --> 00:11:25.170
3 square roots of 3.

00:11:25.170 --> 00:11:27.390
And we are done.

00:11:27.390 --> 00:11:28.670
This is our answer.

00:11:28.670 --> 00:11:35.270
This is the area of this
orange region right there.

00:11:35.270 --> 00:11:37.800
Anyway, hopefully
you found that fun.
