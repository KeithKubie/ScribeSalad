00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:12.403
[inaudible]

2
00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:23.930
chicken [inaudible] listening on this [inaudible] to get your groove going,

3
00:00:30.951 --> 00:00:34.420
man.
You can't be on the run.
They say different pages.
US.

4
00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:41.480
How sparks in the house?
He didn't have his headphones on.
You're literally,

5
00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:49.960
this is the coop Brian.
Yeah,
we are the ones CEO's crup.
Yes.

6
00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:56.180
When a time when crack was go didn't hit pop was not yet platinum.

7
00:00:56.181 --> 00:00:59.030
So that's how the stacks,
to quote my mood,

8
00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:04.050
like [inaudible] isn't like when someone else takes the government.

9
00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:08.720
Yeah.
So why are we saying Cooper?
I was thinking chicken coop.

10
00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:11.340
I don't think chicken coops spelled that way brother.
Now and you're right.

11
00:01:11.341 --> 00:01:15.020
If they're going to get below a c,
double o says house parts.
I agree with them.

12
00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:15.690
You

13
00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:19.350
<v 2>know they are the ones that after nine 11 had that controversial album with the</v>

14
00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:24.270
two twin towers,
I think that were exploding on,
I remember that.
The CD,
damn,

15
00:01:24.271 --> 00:01:27.120
I don't remember that at all,
but I just retention.
Yeah.

16
00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:28.943
That's the way in that way.

17
00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:32.520
That would reinforce the COO concept as a name as opposed to,

18
00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:34.680
I remember when Biggie did the original blow up,

19
00:01:34.681 --> 00:01:38.100
like the world trade and people are like,
Whoa,
what the fuck did you say?

20
00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:42.870
And that's only when a few people had died.
Right.
Bold move.

21
00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:47.480
Cool.
They're taken over folks.
That's what it is.
It's,
I mean,
I guess that's,

22
00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:50.160
those are the kinds of things you're going to save when you're trying to break

23
00:01:50.161 --> 00:01:53.040
through the den of,
of a saturated market.
Yeah.

24
00:01:53.041 --> 00:01:56.430
Before we get into any controversial subjects,
we must thank our sponsor,

25
00:01:56.431 --> 00:02:00.180
the fleshlight.
We are sponsored by a masturbation tool.
Mr. Sparks,

26
00:02:00.181 --> 00:02:02.400
I don't know if you've ever used one of these things.
I have not used it,

27
00:02:02.401 --> 00:02:04.440
but I'm familiar with the concept you have touched on.

28
00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:09.090
These are all virgins and suffer fingers.
Put your fingers inside of it.

29
00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:13.410
Fascinating product,
man.
It works very well.
That's great.
And dairy effect.

30
00:02:13.411 --> 00:02:16.470
It's good.
It's not,
uh,
like,
you know,

31
00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:19.960
it's not just a blue color samples.
It's gonna.

32
00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:22.770
Necrophilia how about the double clearly Yak at you,
right?

33
00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:26.310
Does anybody really ever turn blue?
Huh?
I don't think they ever hit that stage.

34
00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:30.200
Dot.
Color.
Color me high or they're an alien,
right?
Yeah.

35
00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:31.200
Or there really aren't alien.

36
00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:33.990
Or are you trying to body and then it would be for you think a body in the river

37
00:02:33.991 --> 00:02:37.590
looks like that?
Probably it's like blue,
green Yanni,
bloated,

38
00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:39.301
bloated.

39
00:02:39.301 --> 00:02:43.080
Fleshlight I don't know if we look at a silence of the lambs is our reference

40
00:02:43.081 --> 00:02:46.260
point for his body found in the woods.
She was relatively pinkish.

41
00:02:46.261 --> 00:02:49.890
Her fingertips and feet were or bluish.
But I think,
I don't,

42
00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:51.310
they never closed up on the bar.

43
00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:55.200
How many dudes get inspired by those movies to become serial killers?

44
00:02:55.201 --> 00:02:57.710
Like how many people would just want to be someone special so they go,

45
00:02:57.730 --> 00:02:59.680
that guy got caught,
but I'm gonna,
you know what,

46
00:02:59.681 --> 00:03:03.400
I'm going to go out there and do that.
Well,
a lot of them,
a lot of them are too,

47
00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:08.320
uh,
I guess don't have the,
uh,
the ability to see it through cause serial killer.

48
00:03:08.321 --> 00:03:11.980
That's right.
That's a commitment.
And most people do the,
uh,
yeah,
sorry,

49
00:03:11.981 --> 00:03:15.610
I don't know how to shut it.
Right.
So I leave it open it oil or something.

50
00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:21.700
It's like,
dude,
my fleshlight went bad.
It's right.
Um,
but uh,
a lot of guys,

51
00:03:21.701 --> 00:03:25.050
what they'll do is they'll get inspired by that,
do the workplace violence thing,

52
00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:28.090
go up and shoot a girlfriend,
shoot a shoot up their office.
Those,

53
00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:29.410
that's where those guys come from.

54
00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:32.490
And then they ended up shooting themselves cause it's nothing like they expect

55
00:03:32.491 --> 00:03:34.690
it.
Is that why they do,
what are the,

56
00:03:34.691 --> 00:03:37.270
most of the time I'm shooting themselves in the first place.
Some,

57
00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:38.440
some say they do or whatever,

58
00:03:38.441 --> 00:03:40.360
they are going to commit suicide by cop or whatever.

59
00:03:40.361 --> 00:03:43.630
But a lot of them go down because they're looking at the dead people and going,

60
00:03:43.631 --> 00:03:45.850
this is nothing like a movie.
This is nothing like a video game.

61
00:03:45.851 --> 00:03:48.460
This is nothing like I thought.
And then they just can't take it.
Yeah.

62
00:03:48.461 --> 00:03:51.610
They have this because of the guys who've survived trying to kill themselves.

63
00:03:51.611 --> 00:03:55.300
That's,
that's what they said.
Christ how fucking,

64
00:03:55.330 --> 00:04:00.270
it just shows the broad spectrum of human thinking and behavior.
Oh yeah.
No,

65
00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:03.400
people are,
it's so fascinating.
You know,
when you just,
you know,

66
00:04:03.401 --> 00:04:06.370
just you meet someone and you just can't jive with this guy,

67
00:04:06.371 --> 00:04:09.940
this guy's broken or he's fucking wacky or whatever and you're like,
God,

68
00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:12.520
I could have just met the coolest person in the world instead.

69
00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:17.080
I met the Douchey is personal random,
right.
You know,
it's,
it's,
if someone,

70
00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:20.680
like in the other world who's running the game controller that runs that

71
00:04:20.681 --> 00:04:22.540
particular body in this environment,

72
00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:25.630
it's as if he handed the controller to his friend and would just try the game

73
00:04:25.631 --> 00:04:26.960
for awhile.
You know what I mean?

74
00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:29.710
A second ago there was a guy who knew how to run.
It was like,
okay,

75
00:04:29.711 --> 00:04:32.230
I'm living a good life.
I've got a guy going,
he's pretty interesting.

76
00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:34.510
And then he hands it to his friend who's never played the game before and he's

77
00:04:34.511 --> 00:04:37.420
like,
fuck,
I keep running into the wall.
You know,

78
00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:40.790
there's a lot of people that just keep running into the walls.
Totally.
Your,

79
00:04:40.791 --> 00:04:43.810
you'll run into people that I've met people in my life that easily could've been

80
00:04:43.811 --> 00:04:47.800
shooters.
They easily could have,
you know,
they're just,
Oh yeah.
One tragedy away.

81
00:04:47.801 --> 00:04:51.850
One ass kicking away,
one life ass kicking,
you know,
you lose your job,

82
00:04:51.851 --> 00:04:55.870
lose your house.
You know,
Lewis was the one in high school.
I wasn't that far off.

83
00:04:55.871 --> 00:05:00.520
Really?
Yeah.
For Real.
Yeah.
For Real.
What was it about belong,
Huh?
No,
no,

84
00:05:00.521 --> 00:05:04.860
it was a,
it was,
I came from the country like stick built,

85
00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:08.170
you know like Kentucky and I moved to Chicago in the first year I was there.

86
00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:12.190
I was pretty fucking miserable because I was such an outcast and it was so like

87
00:05:12.191 --> 00:05:16.090
it was a super rich school is I went from a school that had 140 people in my

88
00:05:16.091 --> 00:05:19.210
class to 1400 in my class,
like,
and,

89
00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:23.220
and I had a southern accent and fucking peach fuzz mustache and we were broke

90
00:05:23.221 --> 00:05:26.800
and I lived in a guest house up the street and all these kids were like Roland

91
00:05:26.801 --> 00:05:28.210
and Mercedes and that kind of stuff.

92
00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:31.570
And I had that kind of outsider like anger about it.

93
00:05:31.571 --> 00:05:35.940
And then what solved it was,
was the fact that a girl,

94
00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:39.820
two girls approached me at,
uh,
at a party at the same time.

95
00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:45.160
And it occurred to me that they're,
there was,
there was a fork in the road here.

96
00:05:45.161 --> 00:05:48.160
I could go violent Hal or I could get laid and this was the choice and I,

97
00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:53.410
I went with getting late.
Wow.
So your response to just being an outcast,

98
00:05:53.411 --> 00:05:56.770
you just,
you want it to get violent with them?
Yeah.
Well certain ones of them,

99
00:05:56.771 --> 00:05:58.370
I mean I into a bunch of fights the first

100
00:05:58.370 --> 00:06:01.520
<v 3>like,
like three months I was there,
I almost got kicked out.</v>

101
00:06:01.690 --> 00:06:04.690
Is that about people that,
you know,
new people can come around.

102
00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:07.950
They just immediately sensed the weakness and want to start fucking with that.

103
00:06:08.030 --> 00:06:09.860
There's some people that just do that.
You know?

104
00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:13.400
I had the same situation in my life where I moved around a lot.

105
00:06:13.401 --> 00:06:15.950
We moved from Tom,
I was seven,

106
00:06:16.340 --> 00:06:20.210
we moved to New Jersey or two from New Jersey to San Francisco.

107
00:06:20.211 --> 00:06:25.211
Lived in San Francisco until I was 11 and then 11 to 13 lived in Florida and

108
00:06:25.251 --> 00:06:28.760
then 13 to 24 I lived in Boston.
Right.
So it was the same sort of thing.

109
00:06:28.761 --> 00:06:30.870
It was like you never really get settled,
you know,

110
00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:33.530
and right when you develop some friends and start,
you know,

111
00:06:33.531 --> 00:06:37.130
having like a little base of people you hang out with and it seems like life is

112
00:06:37.131 --> 00:06:40.550
normal.
Yeah.
For kids.
That's fucking huge,
man.
If you don't have friends,

113
00:06:40.551 --> 00:06:41.181
you don't have a life,

114
00:06:41.181 --> 00:06:44.500
like tell the adults think that they can just fucking take your kids and snatch

115
00:06:44.501 --> 00:06:46.430
them out of someplace and it's not going to hurt them to just,

116
00:06:46.550 --> 00:06:48.430
while you're just going to get used to Kansas,
you know?

117
00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:51.020
And then they get Douche on in school and they don't have any friends anymore

118
00:06:51.021 --> 00:06:53.660
and meanwhile they had the coolest friends ever back home and wherever the fuck

119
00:06:53.661 --> 00:06:56.060
they're from,
that's a traumatic fucking thing for,
yeah.

120
00:06:56.061 --> 00:06:57.800
I think as an adult you just kind of,
it's,

121
00:06:57.890 --> 00:07:01.400
you do take some level of friendship for granted because you start recognizing

122
00:07:01.401 --> 00:07:03.800
the world as a relatively big place in a positive sense,

123
00:07:04.070 --> 00:07:07.760
and that there are people to hang out with everywhere you go and you overlay

124
00:07:07.761 --> 00:07:11.060
that thought form on a new brain,
it doesn't quite land as well.

125
00:07:11.180 --> 00:07:13.130
The issue is I think that,
well,
you know,

126
00:07:13.370 --> 00:07:16.880
really it's just a hurdle and you got over it and I go over it and most kids do

127
00:07:16.881 --> 00:07:18.020
get over it.
In fact,

128
00:07:18.050 --> 00:07:21.620
it could be argued that the best way to make an interesting person as to put

129
00:07:21.621 --> 00:07:23.150
them through a fucked up child.
Absolutely.

130
00:07:23.300 --> 00:07:25.280
Because pretty much everybody that I know,
that's interesting.

131
00:07:25.281 --> 00:07:27.710
All of my friends had fucked up childhoods.

132
00:07:27.711 --> 00:07:31.370
I don't have any normal friends where,
you know,
they talk about their childhood.

133
00:07:31.371 --> 00:07:33.000
It was just like my dad was always there for me.

134
00:07:33.001 --> 00:07:36.440
He took me to fucking wrestling practice every day and my mom always bake cakes.

135
00:07:36.860 --> 00:07:38.660
None of them,
nobody ever hear any of that shit.

136
00:07:38.690 --> 00:07:41.640
And most of the ones I do meet our relatively miserable.
Yeah.

137
00:07:41.690 --> 00:07:44.660
And I spend a good deal of my time entertaining a lot of them.

138
00:07:45.320 --> 00:07:48.650
And do you think that they're normal to you think they're just different,

139
00:07:48.680 --> 00:07:52.610
different ones?
Sublimate we need directions for life.
Goddammit.

140
00:07:52.670 --> 00:07:53.900
We need a fucking guide.

141
00:07:53.930 --> 00:07:57.080
This is ridiculous that we get stuck into the most complicated puzzle.

142
00:07:57.110 --> 00:08:02.060
Any living organism that we can comprehend can go through the idea of evolving

143
00:08:02.061 --> 00:08:04.760
as a human being,
becoming a productive member of society,

144
00:08:04.761 --> 00:08:07.790
getting your emotions in order,
getting your your energy in order,

145
00:08:07.791 --> 00:08:09.500
getting your life in,
order,
your friendships in order.

146
00:08:09.650 --> 00:08:14.300
That's fucking Uber complicated hand.
And we don't even have a guidebook.
Well,

147
00:08:14.301 --> 00:08:17.540
but the guidebook would be wrong at the crucial point is the problem.

148
00:08:17.541 --> 00:08:19.890
And by the way,
we've tried to set up guidebooks there,

149
00:08:20.600 --> 00:08:24.980
but would there be a way to have a guide book just for clarity of thinking,

150
00:08:25.370 --> 00:08:29.090
just objective clarity of thinking and letting people understand.

151
00:08:29.091 --> 00:08:32.180
I think that's like a giant percentage of what the problem with human beings is,

152
00:08:32.570 --> 00:08:34.610
is that there,
even if they find the answer,

153
00:08:34.790 --> 00:08:37.220
if the answer doesn't jive with their life,
they're,

154
00:08:37.221 --> 00:08:40.550
they're not willing to accept it.
You know,
they get angry about whatever it is.

155
00:08:40.580 --> 00:08:43.710
Everything has to bottleneck through there.
Their,
their past.

156
00:08:44.150 --> 00:08:48.230
People just have these fucking rigid ideas in their head and once,

157
00:08:48.260 --> 00:08:52.460
once those ideas are challenged and then it becomes a battle for their soul,

158
00:08:52.490 --> 00:08:56.070
you know,
it becomes,
it's not just,
uh,
you know,
they disagree about an

159
00:08:56.070 --> 00:08:57.840
<v 2>issue and I'm not totally attached to it.</v>

160
00:08:58.140 --> 00:09:00.390
I've had great conversations with people that are super,

161
00:09:00.391 --> 00:09:03.630
really super appreciate when they're not attached to their idea.

162
00:09:03.810 --> 00:09:07.770
You know what I mean?
Right.
When they're not like arguing in a real personal way,

163
00:09:07.771 --> 00:09:10.060
when it's like,
you know,
you,
you,
you,
you were like,
when they're in,

164
00:09:10.080 --> 00:09:13.170
not in insecure about,
yeah,
they just have an idea about things.

165
00:09:13.210 --> 00:09:15.090
That's the only way human beings ever evolved.

166
00:09:15.091 --> 00:09:19.440
But the problem is life is a big Dick contest and everyone's wants their idea to

167
00:09:19.441 --> 00:09:24.080
be the best idea.
So they tried to force right.
Than happy.
Yeah,
exactly.
Yeah,

168
00:09:24.420 --> 00:09:27.660
exactly.
And the people who's always trying to be right are never happy.
No.

169
00:09:27.870 --> 00:09:30.200
Everyone,
incidentally,
the most miserable.

170
00:09:30.210 --> 00:09:35.210
Winning is the only sense they had the most miserable people the most who always

171
00:09:36.331 --> 00:09:39.510
want to be right.
You know,
and anybody in places where it's not right,

172
00:09:39.540 --> 00:09:43.650
like there's a comic that I know that would always criticize people's acts and

173
00:09:43.651 --> 00:09:45.720
tell him like,
what are you doing this for?
Man?
You can do better than this.

174
00:09:45.721 --> 00:09:49.860
And the guy liked his act but does act as like super juvenile [inaudible] like

175
00:09:49.890 --> 00:09:53.450
that kind of shit.
That's really the same thing.
It's like what would you,

176
00:09:53.451 --> 00:09:57.270
what are you saying?
What you like,
right?
You want everyone to like what you like.

177
00:09:57.271 --> 00:10:00.720
Exactly.
Dick.
It's absurd.
It's,
you know,
for an extreme example,

178
00:10:00.721 --> 00:10:04.110
it's one of the things when I laugh at people who go off on Nickelback or

179
00:10:04.111 --> 00:10:04.801
something like that,

180
00:10:04.801 --> 00:10:08.950
or even carrot top where you're like [inaudible] they literally go bunch of

181
00:10:09.030 --> 00:10:11.730
corporate assholes who just sell our shit and you go,
wait a minute,

182
00:10:11.880 --> 00:10:15.810
what Elvis Costello Song should they be doing in a coffee house to make you

183
00:10:15.811 --> 00:10:16.644
happy?
Because

184
00:10:18.240 --> 00:10:23.240
even at balance to help what you like exist to some degree and you need to leave

185
00:10:23.311 --> 00:10:27.840
that shit alone.
If it doesn't resonate with you,
knock,
you know,
cares.
Um,

186
00:10:27.940 --> 00:10:30.180
I,
it's not successful is what it is.

187
00:10:30.181 --> 00:10:33.090
It's too successful and it's too smooth and it's too packaged.

188
00:10:33.300 --> 00:10:36.260
What it is is they're good.
Right.
Good pop band.
Right.

189
00:10:36.300 --> 00:10:40.260
But I mean it's like I met that Nickelback guy too.
It was,
they were doing a man.

190
00:10:40.350 --> 00:10:42.740
Yeah,
man recently.
Yeah.
I was at the uh,

191
00:10:42.800 --> 00:10:47.730
UFC and there they had a show the night before the UFC.
Like [inaudible] Alon.
No,

192
00:10:47.760 --> 00:10:49.990
we get our nails done together.
Him Mad.

193
00:10:50.050 --> 00:10:54.360
I was getting my knuckle shave and he was getting his hair done.
You got,
you got,

194
00:10:54.670 --> 00:10:58.290
you got to whack that.
I want to let everybody know I'm Harry everywhere.

195
00:10:58.291 --> 00:10:59.160
I don't give a fuck.

196
00:10:59.220 --> 00:11:02.060
And you're at linens and things and I met the guy from Nickelback.
There's,

197
00:11:02.180 --> 00:11:05.760
that's one of those universal,
easy to hate Justin Bieber type thing.

198
00:11:06.080 --> 00:11:09.900
Like I don't have a problem with Justin Bieber.
I it seem like he's a little kid.

199
00:11:10.020 --> 00:11:12.590
Right.
That's what I mean.
Fucking Justin Bieber,

200
00:11:12.680 --> 00:11:14.880
if all you're one more fucking Justin Bieber song.
I'm like,

201
00:11:15.030 --> 00:11:19.020
what channel are you listening?
You go outside and go for a walk,

202
00:11:19.021 --> 00:11:22.500
smell some flowers for a radio stations.
There actually are.
Fuck,

203
00:11:22.501 --> 00:11:25.400
where the fuck is your iPod at this point?
You know,
it's interesting.

204
00:11:25.401 --> 00:11:28.950
We were talking about five by and load one more Justin Bieber song on my own

205
00:11:28.951 --> 00:11:32.700
iPod and listen to it as I sleep.
I'm going to kick my own and get started.

206
00:11:32.701 --> 00:11:36.050
One More Justin Bieber song.
We're fighting every night.

207
00:11:36.360 --> 00:11:38.680
I'm going to beat myself up.
Do you remember that kid?
Um,

208
00:11:38.730 --> 00:11:43.590
I don't remember his name but he did.
Um,
he performed that Paparazzi Song.

209
00:11:43.950 --> 00:11:48.540
Um,
it did it in like a school talent show and he has this incredible voice.

210
00:11:49.170 --> 00:11:52.410
His name is like glazing or something like that.
God Damn it.

211
00:11:52.411 --> 00:11:55.270
Somebody put it up on the board.
Have you heard about that recently?

212
00:11:55.271 --> 00:11:56.230
That's like eight years old.

213
00:11:56.231 --> 00:11:58.180
Somebody throw that up on my Twitter cause you know who it is.

214
00:11:58.210 --> 00:12:02.410
If a kid was on Ellen is a,
okay.
Anyway,
they,
they,
uh,

215
00:12:02.440 --> 00:12:06.850
the kid has this insane voice and the video is this really intense video because

216
00:12:06.851 --> 00:12:09.700
it's like,
it's,
if you haven't seen it [inaudible] oh dude,

217
00:12:09.701 --> 00:12:10.421
you've got to pull it up.

218
00:12:10.421 --> 00:12:12.940
Pull that video up so he can watch this and we could talk about this.

219
00:12:12.941 --> 00:12:17.830
You know what his name is or anything like child prodigy singer.

220
00:12:17.831 --> 00:12:21.400
Uh,
Ellen.
I don't know.
We'll find out what the,
what the fuck is his name?

221
00:12:21.401 --> 00:12:24.610
Twitter verse.
Yeah.
You know,
you know who I'm talking about?
God dammit.

222
00:12:25.510 --> 00:12:30.400
You freaks.
Uh,
I'll check my Twitter feed.
Mills Wells.
It's a girl or guy.

223
00:12:31.050 --> 00:12:35.840
It's a dude or uh,
it was Justin race.

224
00:12:36.380 --> 00:12:39.280
Yes.
That's his name.
Grayson.

225
00:12:40.540 --> 00:12:43.820
I thought it was glazing cause there's a fighter named glaze and t bow.

226
00:12:44.190 --> 00:12:47.530
Those like testing me.
What are you doing?
No,
that's not what you're doing Brian.

227
00:12:47.890 --> 00:12:52.160
Which is go,
there's a video.
There's a video of him in like a town.

228
00:12:52.170 --> 00:12:57.100
Now what does that fucking commercials?
Yeah.
Then I'm,
yes,
that's it.

229
00:12:57.101 --> 00:12:59.810
That's the video.
Grace in Michael,
somebody to here.
He goes,

230
00:13:00.680 --> 00:13:05.090
<v 1>oh,
now check this kid out.
This is a fucking like seventh grade talent contest.</v>

231
00:13:05.091 --> 00:13:05.630
Okay.

232
00:13:05.630 --> 00:13:10.460
Check out these bitches in the audience you have never seen like pure,

233
00:13:11.060 --> 00:13:15.950
animalistic connection and attraction.
These women can't help their little girls.

234
00:13:15.951 --> 00:13:16.551
I shouldn't say women.

235
00:13:16.551 --> 00:13:21.530
These little girls are fascinated by what this kid can do and the difference

236
00:13:21.531 --> 00:13:26.270
between them and him.
It's like a jazz them between like a rat in a god.

237
00:13:27.170 --> 00:13:30.470
You know?
Look at these girls in the audience there.
Stare at this kid now WIC,

238
00:13:30.500 --> 00:13:32.420
WIC.
Did you hear this motherfucker?
Buses shit out.

239
00:13:32.450 --> 00:13:33.090
<v 4>Hello?</v>

240
00:13:33.090 --> 00:13:38.090
[inaudible]

241
00:13:38.770 --> 00:13:42.040
<v 1>I've never done anything that good in my life.
There's a girl in a bad on though.</v>

242
00:13:42.070 --> 00:13:44.470
Listen to this kid's voice.
Got Her hand on her.
Yeah,

243
00:13:44.620 --> 00:13:46.660
she starts playing with her hair.
Yep.

244
00:13:46.690 --> 00:13:49.540
And her hand goes away and she starts looking around the room.

245
00:13:49.990 --> 00:13:53.080
Does everyone else reacting to simply this fucking kid's voice?
Listen to this

246
00:13:56.720 --> 00:14:01.720
<v 4>[inaudible] I've</v>

247
00:14:08.070 --> 00:14:10.920
<v 1>never been that good at anything in my life and I never will.
Joe.</v>

248
00:14:10.921 --> 00:14:14.030
Never left moment.
I'll never hit that moment.
Really.
Joe Never,

249
00:14:14.100 --> 00:14:17.430
never listened to this song alone.
Jeff,
listen dude,
listen to this kid's voice.

250
00:14:17.431 --> 00:14:22.050
This motherfucker's nailing this.
He's like,
Oh,
11 oh,
I get it,

251
00:14:22.230 --> 00:14:25.530
and he's in front of a talent contest.
Nobody even knows he's doing this.

252
00:14:25.800 --> 00:14:28.770
This motherfucker's connecting to Gaia right now.

253
00:14:29.370 --> 00:14:32.250
He's a little kid and he's figured out how to do this.

254
00:14:33.030 --> 00:14:35.610
You know why it hasn't gotten any pussy yet?
No one's broken as hard.

255
00:14:35.611 --> 00:14:38.340
No one's taking his money.
He's never had to work for them for food.

256
00:14:38.341 --> 00:14:42.810
He's not getting in his own way is what it exactly.
Listen to this mother fucker.

257
00:14:42.900 --> 00:14:45.700
I think he needs to check his ego though.
Watch

258
00:14:53.470 --> 00:14:57.740
the girl who had her hand on her face was just riveting pitches.
He hypnotized.

259
00:14:57.830 --> 00:15:00.740
She's going to be every guy who fucks her for the rest of her life.

260
00:15:00.830 --> 00:15:03.140
She's going to be thinking about this kid singing in the background.

261
00:15:05.080 --> 00:15:08.370
She's going to try to Facebook him when she's 40 and she has kids and divorced.

262
00:15:08.410 --> 00:15:11.900
Oh really?
She's Never gonna forget this kid ever,
and he and his partner.

263
00:15:11.901 --> 00:15:13.510
We'll be living happily in Michigan.

264
00:15:16.890 --> 00:15:21.230
Could be.
I wonder if this room for just John Meyer,
this motherfucker.
Yeah.

265
00:15:21.500 --> 00:15:24.920
I wonder if this room smells the same at the end of this song as when it
started.

266
00:15:24.980 --> 00:15:27.530
I think it smells the same as a fish store.
No,

267
00:15:28.130 --> 00:15:29.780
I couldn't possibly their children,

268
00:15:29.920 --> 00:15:32.810
those little bitches of breeding man hormones in the beef.

269
00:15:32.811 --> 00:15:33.800
That's not what egg smell.

270
00:15:34.010 --> 00:15:37.830
Listen to every one of those little flux can get pregnant if they were gone.

271
00:15:37.960 --> 00:15:41.750
They were banging.
They'd have kids at all of the kids.
Gorillas in the mist.
Yeah.

272
00:15:41.751 --> 00:15:44.120
We are gorillas in the,
here's the thing too,
this is,

273
00:15:47.330 --> 00:15:50.000
he's got a purity of emotion that he's connecting to,

274
00:15:50.150 --> 00:15:53.300
but it's not the same as what's happening in that song.
Yeah.

275
00:15:53.430 --> 00:15:57.560
What fascinates it's his own,
your raw fears as a kid,

276
00:15:57.561 --> 00:16:01.880
your raw disconnection.
That has nothing to do with the content of them.

277
00:16:02.020 --> 00:16:04.780
<v 5>Lyrics.
Nothing just fit.
Right.
I mean he's singing about</v>

278
00:16:04.850 --> 00:16:07.310
<v 1>paparazzis and cigarettes and you know,</v>

279
00:16:10.990 --> 00:16:14.570
that shows you about music man,
that it's,
it really is

280
00:16:14.720 --> 00:16:16.730
<v 5>all art a window into purity,</v>

281
00:16:16.790 --> 00:16:21.230
a window into like purity of expression and it doesn't matter if you even know

282
00:16:21.231 --> 00:16:24.390
the words to what you're saying.
No.
Well that's the thing.
You don't Melanie,

283
00:16:24.400 --> 00:16:27.900
that's the resonant path.
There's,
it's like a sound freak thing,
but,

284
00:16:28.130 --> 00:16:30.830
but when you hear words that nail it to tell,

285
00:16:30.860 --> 00:16:34.640
it brings in another level when it's like the perfect lyric along with the

286
00:16:34.641 --> 00:16:37.740
perfect music.
Music is such a trip man.
Yeah.

287
00:16:38.120 --> 00:16:43.010
Why band rehearsal last night for three and a half hours.
And they were,

288
00:16:43.040 --> 00:16:46.730
we were working on some stuff and we're adding like songs to the lineup and

289
00:16:46.731 --> 00:16:48.240
stuff that I hadn't with my,
uh,

290
00:16:48.320 --> 00:16:52.370
former band mates had never been able to sort of get the vibe of,

291
00:16:52.790 --> 00:16:54.560
came really naturally with these guys.

292
00:16:54.770 --> 00:16:58.240
And so it was like we're standing there after the song going,
oh,

293
00:16:58.310 --> 00:17:02.600
that was exempt band is called zero one,
right.
The word zero and the number one.

294
00:17:02.601 --> 00:17:06.020
Yeah.
Yeah.
But,
um,
but I've,
I,
you know,

295
00:17:06.021 --> 00:17:09.350
if you leave me alone and,
and there's nothing else to do,

296
00:17:09.351 --> 00:17:13.220
if I don't have a place to go or whatever,
what I do is write music.
Wow.
And it's,

297
00:17:13.250 --> 00:17:17.720
and I can sit with a guitar and start writing stuff.
And so the,
and I and I,

298
00:17:17.960 --> 00:17:20.480
I feel like I'm ready to at a certain point where I've written songs that

299
00:17:20.481 --> 00:17:25.010
actually matter to me.
And once you get to that point,
you,
you get that,

300
00:17:25.100 --> 00:17:28.130
you get,
it's spooky almost because you don't feel,

301
00:17:28.370 --> 00:17:30.110
you feel removed from yourself.

302
00:17:30.111 --> 00:17:32.210
It's like great standup when you do a show and you,

303
00:17:32.570 --> 00:17:34.580
you feel like you're watching yourself from behind.

304
00:17:34.670 --> 00:17:36.110
Like your body is acting out the parts.

305
00:17:36.111 --> 00:17:37.670
You're totally committed to what you're saying.

306
00:17:37.850 --> 00:17:40.820
But part of you is like your ego's not there.
Yeah.

307
00:17:41.180 --> 00:17:44.060
And you're real spirit is like 10 feet and you feel like behind you.

308
00:17:44.061 --> 00:17:47.210
I always say that you feel like you're,
you are a passenger.
Yes.
You know,

309
00:17:47.211 --> 00:17:48.410
you don't really feel like you're driving,

310
00:17:48.411 --> 00:17:50.070
you're a passenger and I guess you have

311
00:17:50.070 --> 00:17:52.620
<v 2>your hand on the breaks in case shit goes terribly wrong.
Totally.</v>

312
00:17:52.800 --> 00:17:56.280
But you have maintenance stuff to do.
Yeah.
Right,
yes.
Yeah.
But a lot of the times,

313
00:17:56.281 --> 00:17:59.070
you know,
especially when you just in the perfect groove.
Yeah.

314
00:17:59.500 --> 00:18:02.520
And everybody says the same thing too.
You know?
I mean,
it's interesting.

315
00:18:02.760 --> 00:18:05.730
It's a mechanic.
It's a mechanic that happens naturally.
I think it is,
and it's,

316
00:18:05.760 --> 00:18:08.670
it's any kind of art like that.
And I think that's,
and that's,

317
00:18:08.700 --> 00:18:12.510
that's the beauty is what he's singing has nothing to do with what's in the

318
00:18:12.511 --> 00:18:16.950
words of that song or what the intention of the original artist was or any of
it.

319
00:18:16.951 --> 00:18:21.951
It's just that those notes in that order shake some part of him and knock

320
00:18:22.801 --> 00:18:24.270
something honest.
Loose.
Yeah.

321
00:18:24.271 --> 00:18:27.690
There's something like about one song that really nit hate.
Dude put up.

322
00:18:27.691 --> 00:18:32.040
I'm counting crows,
Mr. Jones and me know,
dude,
I love this fucking song.

323
00:18:32.160 --> 00:18:35.680
Why do you oh no one.
That's all right.
And don't like that song.
Hell No.

324
00:18:35.790 --> 00:18:40.410
Listen Dude,
it was 1993 1993 I was living in New York.

325
00:18:40.620 --> 00:18:44.190
Star minds me phones.
It's a good fucking song.
Even if that did,

326
00:18:44.191 --> 00:18:46.440
did Bang Jennifer Aniston.
Yeah.
That's all I can think of though.

327
00:18:46.470 --> 00:18:48.990
I was living in New York and I saw this video.

328
00:18:48.991 --> 00:18:53.310
I was watching MTV and I saw this video.
I was like 1992 or 1993 and I was like,

329
00:18:53.370 --> 00:18:56.760
God,
if I could just get as comfortable as this motherfucker right.

330
00:18:56.780 --> 00:18:58.260
Cause it was just so comfortable,

331
00:18:58.261 --> 00:19:00.790
relaxed into what it was when he was singing and you know,

332
00:19:00.880 --> 00:19:02.820
he was dancing around singing that song.
I was like,

333
00:19:02.821 --> 00:19:05.970
this guy is just in that zone.
What's wrong Mr. Jones?

334
00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:09.510
You don't get the same feeling I had when I listened to black label society.

335
00:19:09.520 --> 00:19:13.160
Stillborn.
Ah,
I'm not kidding.
It's a commercial right now,

336
00:19:13.161 --> 00:19:17.000
but would be one set of commercials.
Yep.
Going back to the child prodigy.

337
00:19:17.010 --> 00:19:19.490
Have you heard of the Mati be wrapped?

338
00:19:19.500 --> 00:19:24.500
He's the seven year old prodigy rapper and he is fucking amazing dude.

339
00:19:24.631 --> 00:19:28.420
He is for seven years old.
I have a song for him too,
if you want to hear it.

340
00:19:28.421 --> 00:19:31.800
So I'm like,
oh my God.
Yeah,
let's throw him on.
Okay,
here's a,

341
00:19:31.950 --> 00:19:36.710
let's do Kesha.
You'll see he'll do,
he's seven years old.
Remix it.

342
00:19:36.720 --> 00:19:41.700
Keys.
Yeah.
Hold on.
There was two things.

343
00:19:41.701 --> 00:19:46.620
Plan.
Yeah,
that happens on occasions.
Can't tabs baby.

344
00:19:46.621 --> 00:19:50.070
Talk to Matty B and Cra counting crows.
Mattia hey.
Oh by the way,

345
00:19:50.071 --> 00:19:53.610
message to all you people out there with fucking music on your websites.

346
00:19:53.611 --> 00:19:55.980
Cut that shit.
What?
What is it?

347
00:19:55.981 --> 00:19:59.910
1998 I go to your website and music starts playing

348
00:20:01.940 --> 00:20:04.410
and a midi file even worse.
Exactly.

349
00:20:04.411 --> 00:20:07.320
And I'm searching all of your stupid website for the little.

350
00:20:07.321 --> 00:20:11.370
Shut it off and sound off.
What the fuck is wrong with you fellow?
Okay.

351
00:20:11.371 --> 00:20:15.480
You don't need,
I had music on my website too.
I apologize.
So long time ago.

352
00:20:15.700 --> 00:20:19.470
<v 6>We're from that.
What are you doing Brian?
He mixing.
You'll get details.
Yeah.
Tom,</v>

353
00:20:21.210 --> 00:20:26.200
seven years old.
Seven.
What's his name again?
To sit down and watch these guys.

354
00:20:26.201 --> 00:20:30.700
Test and intimidation about Maddie.
Be wrapped on the jeep like this one.

355
00:20:30.701 --> 00:20:34.400
Be Girls on the board about the boys.
Try to be fun,
easy.

356
00:20:34.420 --> 00:20:36.870
And Keith dot doubted that you grow midnight.

357
00:20:37.380 --> 00:20:40.890
Go so next to you while you rapping.
I'm a solo show.

358
00:20:40.891 --> 00:20:45.891
This man on the Macy's parade boat boat off going up seven pounds now due to the

359
00:20:45.910 --> 00:20:48.130
opponents.
She's terrible.
Terrible.

360
00:20:48.310 --> 00:20:49.180
<v 1>It's awful.</v>

361
00:20:49.260 --> 00:20:52.650
<v 5>It's,
you got brain damage,
bro.
That's fresh.</v>

362
00:20:52.810 --> 00:20:57.240
No parents manipulating a child.
That is.

363
00:20:57.270 --> 00:21:00.240
That is total.
They basically had this kid in their living room,

364
00:21:00.510 --> 00:21:04.100
like acting out what he saw and they decided to turn it into something.

365
00:21:04.120 --> 00:21:06.670
Know what that kid needs to live his life a little bit more.
You know,

366
00:21:06.671 --> 00:21:08.690
we need to tell that kid come back when you were 11 yeah,

367
00:21:08.700 --> 00:21:11.070
but a bit Mc Chris's sweat.
He's going to be awesome.
Yeah.

368
00:21:11.490 --> 00:21:13.620
Mc Chris is sweating right now.
You know what,
Mc Chris,

369
00:21:13.890 --> 00:21:16.890
that's his real voice is calm.
Yeah.
He's like,
well,
if that's his real voice,

370
00:21:17.190 --> 00:21:18.600
well actually they're both real voices,

371
00:21:18.601 --> 00:21:22.190
but I'm see Christmas as a super high pitch.
Real voice.
That's how he wrapped it.

372
00:21:22.200 --> 00:21:24.480
Sounds.
Ah,
yeah.
I can't live in that zone.

373
00:21:24.570 --> 00:21:28.120
You can't live in guidance that music goes,
it's not good to me.
Doesn't resonate.

374
00:21:28.140 --> 00:21:32.450
Burt's counting crows.
They still fucking 70 no kid,
dude.
Well,
I mean the,

375
00:21:32.500 --> 00:21:33.300
the style,

376
00:21:33.300 --> 00:21:36.270
here's the thing is a lot of times when when they come up with just like there's

377
00:21:36.271 --> 00:21:39.900
this prodigy,
you can do this kind of music.
He's a seven year old who does this,

378
00:21:39.901 --> 00:21:40.710
whatever.

379
00:21:40.710 --> 00:21:44.460
I feel bad for all the people who do that for a living because it basically says

380
00:21:44.550 --> 00:21:49.020
your shit is so easy to do.
I can make a monkey do it.

381
00:21:49.050 --> 00:21:53.490
I can really take a kid who's a six year old could do this bullshit.
How much?

382
00:21:53.491 --> 00:21:56.820
Who's smarter?
Six year old or a champ.
They've done those studies.
Six year old.

383
00:21:57.240 --> 00:21:57.610
Depends on

384
00:21:57.610 --> 00:22:00.120
<v 1>what kind of chimp.
Yeah.
Okay.
This is,</v>

385
00:22:00.520 --> 00:22:04.630
this is the song I was living in new Rochelle and the shitty ass apartment that

386
00:22:04.631 --> 00:22:08.140
smelled like cat piss cause my cat used to pee by the door.
She was mad at me.

387
00:22:08.141 --> 00:22:12.490
That'll go away for too long.
I come back,
she pissed by my door.
So here I am,

388
00:22:12.491 --> 00:22:15.310
my piss smelling cat house

389
00:22:17.230 --> 00:22:19.720
wondering what the fuck is happening with my career.
What am I doing?

390
00:22:20.560 --> 00:22:23.290
How do I get good?
Yeah.
How do I get good at this comedy thing?

391
00:22:23.291 --> 00:22:28.291
I got these fucking moments where I feel it all comes together and I listened to

392
00:22:30.491 --> 00:22:33.280
this guy singing this and I'm like,
man this guy's not trying to beat.

393
00:22:33.730 --> 00:22:37.540
He's not trying to be anything other than what he is.
Man,

394
00:22:37.541 --> 00:22:40.690
I wish I was beautiful and he's dancing.
I'm like,

395
00:22:42.070 --> 00:22:45.850
tell him stop.
No,
this is a good fucking song,
dude.

396
00:22:46.150 --> 00:22:50.020
And that guy's in the groove,
man.
What he's saying this,
he's having fun.

397
00:22:50.021 --> 00:22:53.400
He's relaxed.
He's not worried,
meaning they know this.

398
00:22:53.490 --> 00:22:56.830
That's my issue with any music.
Long as you mean it.
I don't care.

399
00:22:57.250 --> 00:23:01.420
As long as you're sincere,
dude,
this guys,

400
00:23:01.510 --> 00:23:05.050
he's in the grove,
he's in the groove and I remember saying,
thinking that like,

401
00:23:05.320 --> 00:23:09.250
man,
if I could just get as relaxed as I fucking guys,

402
00:23:09.610 --> 00:23:14.440
that's like 90% of it getting the who the fuck you really are?
You know?
Ready.

403
00:23:14.441 --> 00:23:19.390
Set Action.
Fucking scammers and the what?
Huh?
Lights on you microphone.

404
00:23:19.420 --> 00:23:21.220
Whoa.
Is this even real life?
Right?

405
00:23:21.370 --> 00:23:23.080
You like that little kid coming back from the dentist?

406
00:23:23.081 --> 00:23:27.610
It's all fucked up on drugs.
90% of it is getting to what this guys at right now,

407
00:23:27.611 --> 00:23:30.640
that 10,000 hours,
man.
A lot of a lot of these guys,

408
00:23:30.641 --> 00:23:33.670
especially at this to thinking too,
it's not just the hours.

409
00:23:33.671 --> 00:23:37.150
10,000 hours is the mastery number.
Yeah.
You know,
but it's not just that.

410
00:23:37.180 --> 00:23:39.820
There's 10,000 hours of open makers that suck and they,

411
00:23:39.830 --> 00:23:43.000
they can't get over the hump man.
There's,
it's not just a time,

412
00:23:43.220 --> 00:23:47.420
<v 5>it's a thing.
No,
I agree.
But in his case,
getting to a level of good,</v>

413
00:23:47.810 --> 00:23:51.140
getting to a skill level and then playing probably at 15 years old,

414
00:23:51.141 --> 00:23:54.980
they were probably musically as good as they are now physically like,
you know,

415
00:23:54.981 --> 00:23:59.400
as far as quality of play.
Yeah.
Are you a big counting crows fan?
You know?
No,

416
00:23:59.401 --> 00:24:03.680
but I mean like the guys guys in uh,
um,
and the black rose were like that.

417
00:24:03.681 --> 00:24:06.500
A lot of these bands started out when they're 15 in high school bands by the

418
00:24:06.501 --> 00:24:07.450
time this shit comes out there,

419
00:24:07.460 --> 00:24:12.200
25 they've been playing for 10 years from high school bands to the legit playing

420
00:24:12.230 --> 00:24:15.650
through college,
always in bands doing it again and again and again fucking up,

421
00:24:15.651 --> 00:24:18.410
getting better,
getting,
you know.
And then at the end of it they're like,

422
00:24:18.800 --> 00:24:22.870
I was as good a player 10 years ago as I am right now.
But now I know what,

423
00:24:22.910 --> 00:24:26.310
why am playing the notes as opposed to how to

424
00:24:26.380 --> 00:24:29.290
<v 3>play them or where you just know yourself more.
You know,</v>

425
00:24:29.291 --> 00:24:33.350
with time as time goes on,
you just know what notes are,
you know,
where,

426
00:24:33.390 --> 00:24:36.250
what resonates resonates with you.
You know,

427
00:24:36.251 --> 00:24:40.000
and that's the to 90% of what it all is,
is finding out what the fuck you do.

428
00:24:40.170 --> 00:24:44.040
<v 5>Every band starts off almost diametrically opposed to where they end up in a lot</v>

429
00:24:44.041 --> 00:24:47.250
of cases in a lot of people call it selling out or like look at the police.

430
00:24:47.460 --> 00:24:48.620
Police is a great example.

431
00:24:48.630 --> 00:24:53.040
They beginning basically a punk band and then by the time they hit what was

432
00:24:53.041 --> 00:24:57.030
legit,
who the police are as ours,
everybody likes it.

433
00:24:57.031 --> 00:25:01.620
It's very commercial and yet still acceptable as genuine art.
It's,
you know,

434
00:25:01.621 --> 00:25:03.840
it's almost diametrically opposed to where they started out

435
00:25:04.060 --> 00:25:05.950
<v 3>sort of.
You know?
I know what you're saying.</v>

436
00:25:05.951 --> 00:25:07.390
We've talked about that with some bands,

437
00:25:07.391 --> 00:25:10.330
but I always attributed to success fucking up their motivation.

438
00:25:10.750 --> 00:25:12.520
I always say times,
but sometimes you,

439
00:25:12.521 --> 00:25:15.880
someone has that pain and they don't have that pain anymore.
You know,

440
00:25:15.881 --> 00:25:19.600
when you have that,
that struggled at the desire to be loved,

441
00:25:19.601 --> 00:25:22.810
the exceptional desire to be loved.
I mean,
that's where most music art,

442
00:25:22.840 --> 00:25:25.600
anything really comes from,
right?
And when you get rich in,

443
00:25:25.601 --> 00:25:27.430
you're just banging all these hot bitches,
you know,

444
00:25:27.431 --> 00:25:29.890
and then he started singing uptown girl,
you know,
that's where it comes from,

445
00:25:29.950 --> 00:25:32.530
right?
I mean,
that's what happened.
Billy Joel,
if you go,

446
00:25:32.531 --> 00:25:35.500
this is my perfect example.
Now if you go and listen to old Billy Joel,

447
00:25:35.710 --> 00:25:38.740
even it's a guy singing and the piano.
And that might not be for you.

448
00:25:38.741 --> 00:25:42.910
And I totally get that.
But if,
but just listen to what this guy's doing,
man.

449
00:25:42.970 --> 00:25:46.510
This is like real shit.
I agree.
You know,
like the ballot of Billy the kid,

450
00:25:46.660 --> 00:25:49.780
that's a powerful fucking song.
Captain Jack,
Dude,

451
00:25:49.781 --> 00:25:54.150
Captain Jack will get you high tonight.
That's a great fucking song,
right?
That's,

452
00:25:54.330 --> 00:25:58.480
that's a beautiful song about a dude who's in pain.
You know,

453
00:25:58.630 --> 00:26:02.170
that's about a dude who's trying to figure out life.
That's,
it's a real song.

454
00:26:02.530 --> 00:26:07.480
He called from that uptown girl what happened,
right,
right.
What happened?

455
00:26:07.550 --> 00:26:11.210
<v 5>I Dunno,
I,
I think you are the master.
You tapped into the fighting chronic.</v>

456
00:26:11.211 --> 00:26:13.520
I yawned,
disconnect from that,
from their pain.

457
00:26:13.521 --> 00:26:16.940
It doesn't mean it doesn't exist anymore.
Different drugs,
you know.
Well,
I,

458
00:26:17.050 --> 00:26:19.370
I just had a burn probably.
Yeah.

459
00:26:19.400 --> 00:26:23.540
I think you're gonna let antidepressants and cocaine.
The cocaine.
Yeah.
Alcohol.

460
00:26:23.840 --> 00:26:28.460
Alcohol is an earthbound drug and thickens your lower bound experience.
And,

461
00:26:28.520 --> 00:26:33.080
and,
and hallucinogenics and,
and cocaine are our resident drugs.

462
00:26:33.081 --> 00:26:34.100
They get you out of your body.

463
00:26:34.130 --> 00:26:38.860
<v 3>No.
Europe's trade edge.
You're a total straight edge.
Now this has been from me.</v>

464
00:26:38.980 --> 00:26:43.010
And if people don't know what that means,
that's no drinking,
no drugs,
no nothing.

465
00:26:43.050 --> 00:26:48.030
Yeah.
Coffee,
uh,
on rare occasion,
but now it's as strong as it gets.
Yeah.

466
00:26:48.270 --> 00:26:50.880
And what is the rational rationale for this?

467
00:26:50.930 --> 00:26:54.980
<v 5>It's a lot of reasons.
Um,
the,
it started out as,
you know,</v>

468
00:26:54.981 --> 00:26:59.000
I'm part native and,
and Scottish,
it's not a good idea to get,
go down that road.

469
00:26:59.060 --> 00:27:03.690
Alcohol wise,
my family,
you know,
you'd go that road,
you keep walking it until,

470
00:27:03.760 --> 00:27:07.510
you know,
it's natural.
And I've seen a lot of people,
the family.
Yeah.

471
00:27:07.640 --> 00:27:11.560
And not just my direct family,
but ancestral roots.
And it was,
you know,

472
00:27:11.990 --> 00:27:15.380
I always joke,
it's kind of like the,
I don't drink the same reason.

473
00:27:15.470 --> 00:27:18.500
Like a lot of Jews don't drive German cars.
There's a little bit of like,

474
00:27:18.501 --> 00:27:22.880
it was used as a weapon,
so fuck you.
Um,
the other reason is is I,

475
00:27:23.540 --> 00:27:27.200
I didn't want the plant to become the fertilizer and for me,

476
00:27:27.201 --> 00:27:32.201
I wanted to find out who I was without added elements or added magnifying

477
00:27:33.291 --> 00:27:36.860
glasses from the outside.
I wanted it to be,
it's,
to me,

478
00:27:37.010 --> 00:27:38.930
drugs represented sort of like a,

479
00:27:39.250 --> 00:27:42.380
a trampoline that allows you to see the top of the mountain.

480
00:27:42.770 --> 00:27:44.150
But if you want to get there,

481
00:27:44.151 --> 00:27:46.850
you still have to eventually get off the trampoline and do the work.

482
00:27:46.851 --> 00:27:50.660
Meditatively or,
or focus,
find yourself,

483
00:27:50.690 --> 00:27:54.500
you can see yourself on drugs.
I have no question that there are people,

484
00:27:54.501 --> 00:27:57.550
especially higher order drugs like pot and,
and,
and,

485
00:27:57.590 --> 00:28:01.070
and mushrooms and those kinds of things are more organic drugs that,
uh,
you know,

486
00:28:01.220 --> 00:28:04.550
I think you can see the essence of who you are and even the essence of the

487
00:28:04.551 --> 00:28:06.710
universe through those things.
I don't doubt that for a second,

488
00:28:07.010 --> 00:28:11.750
but you got to come back and it's not your win necessarily.
And I think you,

489
00:28:12.090 --> 00:28:15.470
you in your life,
your,

490
00:28:15.471 --> 00:28:19.580
your existence deserves the respect of walking there yourself,

491
00:28:19.610 --> 00:28:21.890
getting to that space so that you can see it and say,

492
00:28:21.891 --> 00:28:24.920
I own this space as opposed to somebody handed it to me.

493
00:28:25.020 --> 00:28:27.510
<v 3>That's interesting.
That's a really interesting way of looking at it.</v>

494
00:28:27.540 --> 00:28:31.980
Here's a story.
Um,
uh,
a Buddha,
Buddha ran into this monk.

495
00:28:32.070 --> 00:28:33.060
This monk was a,

496
00:28:34.020 --> 00:28:38.520
I'm walking to the town and then the monks at the Buddha,
I have a practice,

497
00:28:38.521 --> 00:28:42.030
a city of levitation,
and I can now walk on water.

498
00:28:42.031 --> 00:28:46.140
I've worked on this for the last 40 years and the Buddha looks at the monks and

499
00:28:46.141 --> 00:28:50.820
says,
but the ferries Olien nickel,
right?

500
00:28:50.850 --> 00:28:53.760
That's an old Terence Mckenna joke by the way.
I share and it's,

501
00:28:54.030 --> 00:28:57.540
it's an old story that he used to tell that's a true story that did the ideas.

502
00:28:57.720 --> 00:29:00.840
The idea behind it is you can get there way quicker.

503
00:29:01.190 --> 00:29:03.530
<v 5>I agree.
But in this case,
the ferry has,</v>

504
00:29:03.590 --> 00:29:07.310
has a rubber bands attached to the end of it that bring you back and,

505
00:29:07.340 --> 00:29:09.170
and you can't stay.

506
00:29:09.240 --> 00:29:11.160
<v 3>Yeah.
But there's an element of thing from it.</v>

507
00:29:11.161 --> 00:29:15.390
I think personal experience without you having the personal experience,
right.

508
00:29:15.420 --> 00:29:19.350
It's,
I have babies and I've done mushrooms and I always tell people,

509
00:29:19.351 --> 00:29:22.950
unless you've done either one,
don't talk about them because it's the,

510
00:29:24.110 --> 00:29:24.420
the,

511
00:29:24.420 --> 00:29:29.420
the experience of mushrooms is so much more alien than you could ever possibly

512
00:29:30.571 --> 00:29:32.280
imagine.
Okay.
And so this,

513
00:29:32.310 --> 00:29:36.210
the idea that you could somehow or another look at it from the outside and say,

514
00:29:36.211 --> 00:29:39.270
well,
I think it allows you to see outside.
I don't know,
but I don't view it.
Yeah.

515
00:29:39.271 --> 00:29:42.220
I don't view it as an ever done it.
I know,
but what I'm saying,
never not

516
00:29:42.220 --> 00:29:45.880
<v 5>done it now.
Yes,
I have.
I've lived a huge part of my life without doing it,</v>

517
00:29:45.930 --> 00:29:50.170
but not as you now and until you are until I was in my thirties okay.

518
00:29:50.260 --> 00:29:55.260
But that still there is an element of you are now you plus mushrooms for the

519
00:29:55.751 --> 00:29:59.860
rest of your life and for the rest of your experiential life and the rest of

520
00:29:59.861 --> 00:30:01.810
your,
how you see the world.

521
00:30:01.840 --> 00:30:05.800
And I'm not saying that's a plus or a minus in so far as the worth of your life

522
00:30:05.801 --> 00:30:06.490
by any stretch,

523
00:30:06.490 --> 00:30:11.490
but I have made a choice to be me as me with no plus or minus.

524
00:30:12.390 --> 00:30:16.390
<v 3>Totally see what you're saying.
Respect your choice.
What I'm saying is,
you know,</v>

525
00:30:16.440 --> 00:30:19.810
so talk anybody out of it.
You were also you plus vitamins.

526
00:30:19.811 --> 00:30:22.750
You are also using protein,
you plus water.

527
00:30:22.960 --> 00:30:26.650
And I think we look at this idea of uh,
this drug,

528
00:30:27.310 --> 00:30:29.060
especially psychedelic drugs,
right?

529
00:30:29.160 --> 00:30:33.490
We look at the idea as some sort of escape or some sort of a forbidden fruit or

530
00:30:33.491 --> 00:30:37.330
some sort of thing.
I think that's just because they're supposed to be respected.

531
00:30:37.630 --> 00:30:41.370
I think if you experience them and understand what they're really about,
it's,

532
00:30:41.371 --> 00:30:44.800
it's a lot different than it looks like from the outside.

533
00:30:45.100 --> 00:30:49.410
I can see the nobility in your desire to get there on your own right,

534
00:30:49.420 --> 00:30:52.420
to use meditation and clear headed thinking.
You've obviously thought a lot.

535
00:30:52.421 --> 00:30:55.300
You're very bright guidance,
you know,
it's cool to have you on the show,

536
00:30:55.330 --> 00:30:56.320
but why thank you.

537
00:30:56.440 --> 00:30:59.410
There's a big difference between that and the psychedelic experience aside.

538
00:30:59.560 --> 00:31:02.620
Totally agree.
So insanely,
infinitely humbling.

539
00:31:02.850 --> 00:31:06.430
<v 5>So W I would not,
I would not disagree with you on that,
but why I wouldn't you?</v>

540
00:31:06.540 --> 00:31:08.790
How come you're unwilling to allow them?

541
00:31:08.791 --> 00:31:13.791
Because I think there is something insanely humbling about seeking the purity of

542
00:31:14.101 --> 00:31:19.101
my own essence through no external a device other than my own concentration.

543
00:31:20.430 --> 00:31:25.430
And that has worth to me that in so far as my life choices in my life

544
00:31:25.441 --> 00:31:25.921
directions,

545
00:31:25.921 --> 00:31:30.150
which is just as valid as doing it and I would never dissuade someone to or from

546
00:31:30.510 --> 00:31:34.160
the choice to do it or not do it.
This has been a,
uh,

547
00:31:34.210 --> 00:31:39.210
a direct choice I have made of my life to see who I am through my own brain.

548
00:31:41.370 --> 00:31:44.340
Because ultimately what what they do is,
um,

549
00:31:44.370 --> 00:31:47.370
not alter your brain [inaudible] but ultimately release it.

550
00:31:47.640 --> 00:31:51.390
And I think that release is still available to you without it.
Now,
uh,

551
00:31:51.660 --> 00:31:56.100
people may disagree with me on that and they're welcome to,
but I have,

552
00:31:56.230 --> 00:31:57.930
if you can get to mushrooms on your own,

553
00:31:57.931 --> 00:32:02.220
good fucking luck kind of conceptually.
Yeah.

554
00:32:02.870 --> 00:32:04.980
You haven't found out who you are yet though,
right?

555
00:32:04.981 --> 00:32:07.950
So you're searching for yourself.
You're searching for to find out who you are.

556
00:32:07.960 --> 00:32:10.500
You haven't found that yet to cue up the who right now,

557
00:32:10.501 --> 00:32:11.910
who are you throw that shit on.

558
00:32:11.911 --> 00:32:14.880
You want to put some real music on for Brian to that shit up.

559
00:32:15.230 --> 00:32:17.910
So then she had on youtube,
so that's get something for the youngsters.

560
00:32:17.970 --> 00:32:22.530
So people want to understand the purity of expression.
The WHO,
what,
who are you,

561
00:32:22.531 --> 00:32:26.970
motherfucker?
Huh?
Yeah.
How dare you use two hands to type.

562
00:32:26.971 --> 00:32:30.680
This is implied.
Never listened to the WHO.
Oh,

563
00:32:30.900 --> 00:32:32.550
I'm actually sung with Roger Daltrey.

564
00:32:33.090 --> 00:32:36.000
<v 3>Dude,
there was an,
there's a concert.
This is all legend by the way.</v>

565
00:32:36.210 --> 00:32:39.710
There was a concert that they did did the whose performance was so bad acid.

566
00:32:39.711 --> 00:32:40.110
The rolling

567
00:32:40.110 --> 00:32:43.800
<v 2>stones didn't want the video of it released and find the who blew them off the</v>

568
00:32:43.801 --> 00:32:47.400
stage and at a song.
How do you not know this song?
Cause it was on the radio.

569
00:32:47.430 --> 00:32:50.490
You would have to be from another fucking planet if you didn't know this song.

570
00:32:50.540 --> 00:32:52.680
Yeah.
You have to be something wrong with you.

571
00:32:52.890 --> 00:32:57.030
If you smoke two hits of the stuff that I smoke and you did and you hear this,

572
00:32:58.790 --> 00:33:00.450
they didn't have the Internet back then.
Okay.

573
00:33:01.380 --> 00:33:03.610
This is during black and white TVS motherfucker.

574
00:33:12.910 --> 00:33:13.920
The real shit

575
00:33:15.950 --> 00:33:18.130
does a lot like a studio video talks.

576
00:33:22.680 --> 00:33:25.380
They just got it right man.
It's damn a donor.

577
00:33:26.140 --> 00:33:28.200
That's who he looks just like nine feet,

578
00:33:28.810 --> 00:33:32.850
eight towns and once impaled his own hand on his whammy bar during that big

579
00:33:33.540 --> 00:33:37.380
really?
Yeah.
Hand flair is that whammy bar gets stuck in the up position.

580
00:33:37.560 --> 00:33:41.910
Show him outright
shit.

581
00:33:43.970 --> 00:33:46.680
That must be terrifying for a guitarist.
What's his right hand?

582
00:33:46.681 --> 00:33:49.230
I mean you'd manage you,
but you're left handed.
I mean,

583
00:33:49.231 --> 00:33:51.860
I broke my ring finger on my,
on my phone breading hand.

584
00:33:52.160 --> 00:33:54.710
Just one of the scariest things that ever happened to me because of my ring

585
00:33:54.711 --> 00:33:58.160
finger at your bending thinker.
It's the root of all your cords.
One,

586
00:33:58.170 --> 00:34:02.540
I made a decision when it happened because that's three screws in it now.
Whoa.

587
00:34:02.570 --> 00:34:04.940
I made a decision that it would make me a better guitar player.

588
00:34:05.270 --> 00:34:07.790
I didn't know how at the time,
but I made that decision.

589
00:34:08.090 --> 00:34:12.020
I remember the Django Reinhardt who played with two fingers and,
and uh,

590
00:34:12.230 --> 00:34:14.930
Tom Tony Iommi who doesn't have the tips on his fingers.
And I'm like,
if,

591
00:34:14.990 --> 00:34:19.280
if those fuckers can find their way to being that important guitar wise,

592
00:34:19.281 --> 00:34:22.080
I can find my way back from this.
Huh.
And,
uh,

593
00:34:22.140 --> 00:34:25.250
I ended up doing all the Solos on my first record with this broken finger.

594
00:34:25.310 --> 00:34:28.730
My old boxing coach,
Joe Lake,
he got his finger bitten off in a street fight.

595
00:34:28.880 --> 00:34:32.630
So he had his toe removed,
his second toe,
not the big one,
the second toe.
Sure.

596
00:34:32.750 --> 00:34:36.680
And permanently curved like this so that he could throw a right hook.

597
00:34:36.681 --> 00:34:40.820
He had a tremendous rate hook.
Wow.
So where his index finger is,

598
00:34:40.940 --> 00:34:45.590
he has a a toe and it's permanently curved because you know,
they couldn't just,

599
00:34:45.591 --> 00:34:49.850
you know,
have it move,
like they just kind of make this immediate hook thing.

600
00:34:50.120 --> 00:34:54.450
Whereas finger used to be,
and he had it permanently like this.
So he punched my,

601
00:34:54.530 --> 00:34:56.630
when I,
when I,
when I first got the finger fixed,

602
00:34:56.631 --> 00:34:58.460
they told me it would never been passed there.

603
00:34:58.730 --> 00:35:01.520
It would always be stuck kind of bad as far as it go.
It would go,

604
00:35:01.521 --> 00:35:04.660
and I have full articulation in it because I did acupuncture.
Oh,

605
00:35:04.740 --> 00:35:07.750
that was the trick.
Acupuncture did it.
Yep.
Hmm.
Make,

606
00:35:07.760 --> 00:35:11.600
gave me full flexibility in it.
My friend Paul Broca has his broke,

607
00:35:11.601 --> 00:35:15.200
his window is closed in his window and the window shattered and his hand went

608
00:35:15.201 --> 00:35:18.800
through the glass and it's severed the tendons on the last three fingers of his

609
00:35:18.801 --> 00:35:21.230
hand.
Jesus.
And he went through a bunch of operations,

610
00:35:21.231 --> 00:35:22.250
but they couldn't get it right.

611
00:35:22.251 --> 00:35:25.130
He just kept it stayed bent no matter what he did.

612
00:35:25.340 --> 00:35:28.160
So his last three fingers were basically constantly closed.
Yeah.

613
00:35:28.161 --> 00:35:31.730
My friend Andy had that same thing where his ring is [inaudible] he's a guitar

614
00:35:31.731 --> 00:35:35.480
player too,
is a pinky on that from fingers just instantly like that.

615
00:35:35.481 --> 00:35:36.880
And you never noticed when you're talking to,

616
00:35:36.881 --> 00:35:38.910
because a lot of times when he's playing you're like,
oh,
he's just,

617
00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:41.370
that's how he plays or something.
Pretty fascinating.
The,
uh,

618
00:35:41.371 --> 00:35:44.690
the innovation they're making right now with artificial limbs and you know,

619
00:35:44.700 --> 00:35:47.820
totally do it if we don't even know the,
yeah.

620
00:35:47.850 --> 00:35:51.900
That's really exponentially exploding.
You know,
it's,
it's so fascinating.

621
00:35:51.901 --> 00:35:55.740
The concept of an artificial body is only like a few decades away.
Totally.

622
00:35:55.860 --> 00:35:59.780
You know,
it's really,
really pretty fucking scary times,
you know,
I didn't,

623
00:35:59.781 --> 00:36:02.990
you know,
I don't know.
I think it's,
you know,
I mean,
not Pfizer,
just,

624
00:36:02.991 --> 00:36:07.230
just exciting I should say.
Yeah.
Like,
Whoa,
fuck is happening.
Yeah,
totally.
Well,

625
00:36:07.310 --> 00:36:09.540
we,
we can't even picture it,
which is kind of amazing.

626
00:36:09.540 --> 00:36:12.950
We are literally pre-cellphone phone humans,
uh,

627
00:36:12.960 --> 00:36:16.740
about like bionic technology and stuff.
And I'm for it.

628
00:36:16.770 --> 00:36:20.660
I'm a big fan of a longevity.
I'm a big fan of that.
You know,

629
00:36:20.670 --> 00:36:25.380
the Harvard longevity products,
the hundred year lifespan concept and you know,

630
00:36:25.381 --> 00:36:28.590
like they're really working.
Yeah.
But people have to die.
Okay.
Here's the part,

631
00:36:28.650 --> 00:36:29.610
here's the problem with that.

632
00:36:29.730 --> 00:36:32.600
Nobody wants to start over from scratch as a baby again,
but you might have to,

633
00:36:32.650 --> 00:36:35.160
okay.
Right.
Cause this,
the deal is we can't go on forever.

634
00:36:35.190 --> 00:36:38.760
There's too fucking many of us.
We already lives forever.
How we get off plan,

635
00:36:38.940 --> 00:36:39.360
this is the,

636
00:36:39.360 --> 00:36:42.540
this is how we get off planet because you need a thousand year lifespan,

637
00:36:42.541 --> 00:36:44.930
otherwise you can't get to the next galaxy.
That's,

638
00:36:44.931 --> 00:36:49.110
and so that's essentially why re once you really believe that that's what's

639
00:36:49.111 --> 00:36:49.950
happening.
Yeah.

640
00:36:49.951 --> 00:36:53.520
That if you're going to get a spaceship to leave the earth and go to Andromeda

641
00:36:53.521 --> 00:36:57.930
are the next big star that has livable planets next to it of which they found 47

642
00:36:57.931 --> 00:37:00.540
in the last year.
Um,

643
00:37:00.600 --> 00:37:04.140
then you're going to have to have a life span at least exceeding 250 years.

644
00:37:04.500 --> 00:37:06.990
And the ironic part,
and my cousin,
I always talk about this,

645
00:37:06.991 --> 00:37:10.710
that if you have a ship leaves right now headed to a drama with people who can

646
00:37:10.711 --> 00:37:13.140
live to be 250 years old.
By the time they get halfway there,

647
00:37:13.170 --> 00:37:16.110
we'll have doubled the technology and doubled our lifespan to the point where we

648
00:37:16.111 --> 00:37:18.960
will actually meet them there.
And the question will always be,

649
00:37:18.961 --> 00:37:19.800
do you stop and pick them up?

650
00:37:19.950 --> 00:37:23.610
You just planned a party when they arrive but the trip.
But um,

651
00:37:24.030 --> 00:37:25.890
that's just the nature of how technology goes.

652
00:37:25.891 --> 00:37:30.210
They said the first person to live to be 250 is alive right now and probably 15

653
00:37:30.211 --> 00:37:32.850
years old.
Well,
you know,
here's the other issue though.

654
00:37:32.851 --> 00:37:35.610
What if there's another form of space travel that we're just not aware of?

655
00:37:35.700 --> 00:37:40.230
I agree.
I think this idea of shooting rockets through spaces just I think cases,

656
00:37:40.231 --> 00:37:43.410
old school man,
that's how I agree.
Sundial.
I agree.
Well at that point,

657
00:37:43.411 --> 00:37:47.400
age doesn't matter because you're actually referentially in times in space time

658
00:37:47.401 --> 00:37:48.990
you're in,
every place is going to matter.

659
00:37:48.991 --> 00:37:53.070
Your biological system can only stay alive for a certain amount of cycles.

660
00:37:53.071 --> 00:37:54.820
You know,
there's going to be,
it's going to be an end to it,

661
00:37:54.821 --> 00:37:56.940
a certain amount of heartbeats that has on the meter.
Sure.

662
00:37:56.941 --> 00:38:00.070
But you might be able to generate another one with your own stem cells or who

663
00:38:00.080 --> 00:38:02.820
and move into it.
There's all kinds of,
yeah,
that's the thing.

664
00:38:02.821 --> 00:38:06.690
You might be able to generate countless copies of yourself.
So just say,

665
00:38:06.691 --> 00:38:09.630
we haven't done that.
We've just decided to paint them in other ways.

666
00:38:09.631 --> 00:38:10.990
I mean the concept of a soulmate,

667
00:38:11.040 --> 00:38:13.950
what's the difference between that and somebody you share a soul with?

668
00:38:14.190 --> 00:38:17.550
That's a one being with two bodies do have obviously never been divorced.

669
00:38:17.551 --> 00:38:19.230
You don't even know what the fuck you're talking about.

670
00:38:19.920 --> 00:38:22.470
There's a huge difference.
That means that bitch is trying to get your money.

671
00:38:22.471 --> 00:38:25.550
They had nothing to do with soul's.
You guys aren't connected anymore,
right?

672
00:38:25.960 --> 00:38:27.600
Soulmates split up.
Well,
no,

673
00:38:27.780 --> 00:38:31.390
what I'm saying is all bitterness aside,
uh,

674
00:38:32.610 --> 00:38:36.220
no doubt earned.
Um,
it's the,
is kind of like when in a fish

675
00:38:36.220 --> 00:38:37.080
<v 5>tank,
if you look through it,</v>

676
00:38:37.120 --> 00:38:39.820
if you stuck your fingers into a fish tank to the fish,

677
00:38:39.940 --> 00:38:43.510
it sees five different cylinders that are not attached.

678
00:38:43.511 --> 00:38:45.730
But if you keep pushing your hand and you realize that they're all from the same

679
00:38:45.731 --> 00:38:47.950
thing.
And so on a three dimensional world,

680
00:38:47.951 --> 00:38:52.060
you could actually have one so old that had several different expressions in

681
00:38:52.061 --> 00:38:55.570
this three d world,
and we only experienced them as kind of like those cylinders.

682
00:38:55.990 --> 00:39:00.250
And once we see past that,
then we can see that actually one soul may live.

683
00:39:00.400 --> 00:39:04.710
You may be one of 15 different versions of you in this life right now.

684
00:39:04.770 --> 00:39:08.310
There may be,
uh,
uh,
Chinese peasant version of you in a row,

685
00:39:08.420 --> 00:39:11.590
rich Russian version of you and all these running around learning all your

686
00:39:11.591 --> 00:39:16.240
lessons at once because time doesn't really matter and you chose.
And each time,

687
00:39:16.241 --> 00:39:19.330
it's like when you play a video game the first time you play one level,

688
00:39:19.480 --> 00:39:21.220
but then later on you get several games and you're like,

689
00:39:21.400 --> 00:39:23.350
you're doing what you're doing call of duty on one thing.

690
00:39:23.351 --> 00:39:24.400
And you'd go back to it later,

691
00:39:24.401 --> 00:39:27.160
but you want to play this new game for awhile and eventually you get a higher

692
00:39:27.161 --> 00:39:27.461
order.

693
00:39:27.461 --> 00:39:30.700
Sort of thinking with that stuff when you initially started out with just this,

694
00:39:31.300 --> 00:39:32.770
I think we grow and evolve like that.

695
00:39:33.490 --> 00:39:36.410
<v 3>That's some serious speculation though.
Of course.</v>

696
00:39:36.411 --> 00:39:39.890
It is speculating that there's a bunch of user running around living alternate

697
00:39:39.891 --> 00:39:44.090
lives.
Yeah.
Mm.
You know,
I think more likely,

698
00:39:44.420 --> 00:39:47.660
more likely that the whole concept of all of us,

699
00:39:47.720 --> 00:39:51.920
the whole concept of you and I and it's just horse shit.
It's just a trick.

700
00:39:51.921 --> 00:39:54.020
It's like cubicles.
It's like you're all,

701
00:39:54.021 --> 00:39:57.200
we're all working on our little cubicle and eventually there's going to be some

702
00:39:57.201 --> 00:40:00.050
things,
something,
whether it's a technological achievement,

703
00:40:00.051 --> 00:40:01.940
whether it's another advance in evolution,

704
00:40:02.120 --> 00:40:06.920
some new new ability that we're going to detect,
we're,
we're going to have rather

705
00:40:07.220 --> 00:40:11.010
<v 5>I could,
I would call that graduation.
I think this is,
I think this universe,</v>

706
00:40:11.040 --> 00:40:13.200
I think we overreact to the earth.

707
00:40:13.260 --> 00:40:17.280
I think we're too impressed and I think earth is like third to fifth grade in

708
00:40:17.281 --> 00:40:21.870
the universal growth scape things and I think we come here as third graders and

709
00:40:21.900 --> 00:40:23.800
ultimately and leave as fifth graders.
What do you,

710
00:40:23.820 --> 00:40:26.290
what we think is fixed by the earth that,
what do you mean by that?

711
00:40:26.310 --> 00:40:29.280
I mean we're overwhelmed by the experience that we have here and when we think

712
00:40:29.281 --> 00:40:32.280
it's the be all end all and that this is where all the evolution will happen for

713
00:40:32.281 --> 00:40:33.880
your soul and your spirit that you,

714
00:40:33.900 --> 00:40:38.370
there's not another place beyond this that might be at a higher resonance,

715
00:40:38.371 --> 00:40:40.740
whether it's another galaxy or another dimension.

716
00:40:40.741 --> 00:40:44.460
If you want to use earth type terms or you just remove yourself and go,
I don't,

717
00:40:44.580 --> 00:40:48.930
that's earth ends up being a movie you watched for several lifetimes that you

718
00:40:48.931 --> 00:40:50.640
learned and you were entertained by,

719
00:40:50.790 --> 00:40:52.890
but it has nothing to do with your actual existence.

720
00:40:52.891 --> 00:40:55.410
You just gain information from it while you're here,

721
00:40:55.560 --> 00:40:58.890
but it's not the evolution of humankind.
Once it sort of happens,

722
00:40:58.980 --> 00:41:02.460
the purpose of this place sort of ends.
It's like,
you know you leave college,

723
00:41:02.461 --> 00:41:05.010
you don't evolve college.
You know what you mean by that

724
00:41:05.060 --> 00:41:07.970
<v 3>purpose,
this place being civilization,
not earth itself.</v>

725
00:41:08.090 --> 00:41:10.390
<v 5>No,
no,
no.
As human beings the not,</v>

726
00:41:10.391 --> 00:41:14.390
I mean the earth itself are our expression in the earth plane so it's like our

727
00:41:14.391 --> 00:41:14.960
future

728
00:41:14.960 --> 00:41:17.330
<v 3>is somewhere else.
Do you think it's in another galaxy?</v>

729
00:41:17.930 --> 00:41:19.630
<v 5>I mean I think those are earth based terms.</v>

730
00:41:19.631 --> 00:41:21.760
We can't even wrap our head around because we come here.

731
00:41:21.970 --> 00:41:25.590
I think intentionally limiting our experiential life.
We,

732
00:41:25.720 --> 00:41:27.430
we come in Chile intentionally.

733
00:41:27.550 --> 00:41:30.760
We come here to eliminate the same way that when you go see a movie,

734
00:41:30.910 --> 00:41:34.280
you don't think about the rest of the world outside the movie.
You think about,

735
00:41:34.281 --> 00:41:34.731
you sit,

736
00:41:34.731 --> 00:41:38.420
you commit to sitting in the dark and a theater with your ass in a chair and

737
00:41:38.421 --> 00:41:41.810
that's a total limitation of who you are as an ex,
as a human being.

738
00:41:41.811 --> 00:41:45.830
You could run and jump and sing and play guitar and fight and do all this shit,

739
00:41:46.010 --> 00:41:48.830
but you say no.
Right now what I want to do is experience this.

740
00:41:48.831 --> 00:41:51.650
So I'm going to shut all that stuff out.
Because if I did it,

741
00:41:51.680 --> 00:41:55.130
I'd be a toddler in a fucking movie theater,
irritating everyone,

742
00:41:55.131 --> 00:41:57.790
which is why we kill those people.
Why Jesus's?

743
00:41:58.060 --> 00:42:00.800
There's basically like the one running around going and you can laugh and dance

744
00:42:00.801 --> 00:42:02.270
and sing here and we're like,
shut the fuck up.

745
00:42:02.271 --> 00:42:04.940
We're trying to watch the movie because I'm here to learn this.

746
00:42:05.900 --> 00:42:07.010
There's an element of,
and there's,

747
00:42:07.070 --> 00:42:08.840
there's value to those people coming and going.

748
00:42:08.870 --> 00:42:11.210
You guys do realize this is just a movie.
Okay,
so calm down.

749
00:42:11.240 --> 00:42:15.050
There's those guys are helpful.
But to a certain point they interrupt the movie.

750
00:42:15.051 --> 00:42:19.700
So we tend to go fuck off.
Um,
but what I'm saying is,
is that this earth,

751
00:42:20.330 --> 00:42:23.760
this space,
this,
I mean it might just be,
it might be the entire universe,

752
00:42:23.761 --> 00:42:27.430
the entire span of the human existence from cell,
you know,

753
00:42:27.770 --> 00:42:31.940
single cell life form to when we colonize other planets might be us going

754
00:42:31.941 --> 00:42:36.170
through middle school as spirits.
And when we graduate from that,

755
00:42:36.200 --> 00:42:40.310
it's not that the earth becomes like,
Oh,
we've,
you know,
we've reached this point,

756
00:42:40.311 --> 00:42:44.210
we reach a point and then we pop out and it starts from scratch and a cycle for

757
00:42:44.211 --> 00:42:47.450
new spirits to grow into that thing,
you know,
each,
each round.

758
00:42:47.720 --> 00:42:50.810
And so we leave and go somewhere else.
Yeah.
That's the idea or that,

759
00:42:50.840 --> 00:42:54.480
or if there is,
you know,
somewhere is again,
uh,
uh,

760
00:42:54.650 --> 00:42:58.910
a spacial concept,
right?
So it's not,
so you might go someone else frequency,

761
00:42:58.940 --> 00:43:02.910
we might go somewhere else somewhere else,
you know.
But uh,

762
00:43:02.960 --> 00:43:04.340
conceptually,
uh,

763
00:43:04.400 --> 00:43:08.480
I think what we do is when we get to exaggerate too caught up in the earth plane

764
00:43:08.481 --> 00:43:12.290
existence,
we go,
the whole human race has to reach a pinnacle belief.

765
00:43:12.440 --> 00:43:15.350
It's an Armageddon thought for them in a positive or negative sense.

766
00:43:15.351 --> 00:43:16.880
We have to evolve to a point we'll,

767
00:43:17.030 --> 00:43:21.380
maybe we do as individuals or as it's an as an expression of a soul here.

768
00:43:21.650 --> 00:43:24.290
And then we just stopped that expression and go someplace else because we've

769
00:43:24.291 --> 00:43:28.520
learned what this place has to teach us.
The same way you enter middle school,

770
00:43:28.521 --> 00:43:31.400
you don't change middle school by the time you leave,

771
00:43:31.401 --> 00:43:34.430
you just get to eight grade and go,
I don't need middle school anymore.

772
00:43:34.430 --> 00:43:38.540
I'm ready for high school.
And that doesn't devalue middle school.

773
00:43:38.541 --> 00:43:42.260
It's still important.
It's gravely important.
It's great.

774
00:43:42.261 --> 00:43:43.820
It's important to your social factor is great.

775
00:43:43.830 --> 00:43:48.560
Important to your w the learning that's inbetween rudimentary and advanced.

776
00:43:49.070 --> 00:43:53.090
It's got a point but it's not the whole point.
And if you go,

777
00:43:53.270 --> 00:43:57.230
life begins and end in middle school and if we don't always get all these sixth

778
00:43:57.231 --> 00:44:01.220
graders together,
we got to fucking win this.
Or you know,
all the high schools.

779
00:44:01.221 --> 00:44:05.570
Do you propose not concentrating on the present,
maybe,
what do you know?
No,

780
00:44:05.571 --> 00:44:07.810
I think that's what your goal is and that's how you grow.

781
00:44:07.880 --> 00:44:12.710
To just live in the present.
Yeah.
And own that self and just so not,

782
00:44:12.740 --> 00:44:15.020
not be attached to the idea of the earth.

783
00:44:15.200 --> 00:44:18.440
Not Be attached to the idea of this existence.
Yeah.
Just kind of go through it.

784
00:44:18.650 --> 00:44:21.460
Well,
no,
I mean you enjoy it while you're here.
You have to,
I mean,
I,

785
00:44:21.470 --> 00:44:25.550
I'm a believer in using it.
This is all speculation,
right?
Of course it is.

786
00:44:25.970 --> 00:44:29.120
It's supposed to be.
So if I knew it,
I wouldn't have to be here.
No,

787
00:44:29.121 --> 00:44:32.730
but what I was going to say is,
it's interesting how the same speculative

788
00:44:32.820 --> 00:44:37.530
<v 2>speculative ideas keep coming back and forth from like ancient eastern</v>

789
00:44:37.531 --> 00:44:41.790
mysticism,
you know,
to the idea of reincarnation,
right?
Idea of,
you know,

790
00:44:41.820 --> 00:44:44.070
the Kali Yoga,
the ages of the,
it's like,

791
00:44:44.190 --> 00:44:48.630
it's almost like all these different philosophies throughout history have all

792
00:44:48.631 --> 00:44:52.560
come upon the same ideas over and over and over again.
It's like they just,

793
00:44:52.680 --> 00:44:56.520
they get to a certain point where enough people are thinking where they put

794
00:44:56.521 --> 00:45:01.020
enough shit written down so that enough people can learn from the past shit and

795
00:45:01.021 --> 00:45:04.770
then they pile up like to the top of this pyramid of understanding and they all

796
00:45:04.771 --> 00:45:07.230
come to like the same sort of conclusion.
Yeah.
I think,
well,

797
00:45:07.290 --> 00:45:10.800
I think there are two sort of sets.
There's the mechanical sets.

798
00:45:10.801 --> 00:45:15.270
Most real religious,
uh,
sex have sort of an esoteric teaching tradition,

799
00:45:15.271 --> 00:45:16.800
which is the higher order.

800
00:45:16.801 --> 00:45:19.770
You're only allowed to know the secrets once you get to a certain point,

801
00:45:19.800 --> 00:45:24.660
which we all understand.
It's the gated community of,
of,
of spirituality.

802
00:45:24.661 --> 00:45:27.170
You get it,
you got,
it's controlled.
You got will.

803
00:45:27.171 --> 00:45:29.520
You do have to do some work though.
Yeah it is.

804
00:45:29.521 --> 00:45:32.970
But it's like the idea behind it is wrong.
You know that,
you know,

805
00:45:33.180 --> 00:45:35.880
whenever you get people in a position of power that are just holding back

806
00:45:35.881 --> 00:45:38.670
information that I agree,
but I also think there's,
there's,

807
00:45:38.730 --> 00:45:41.130
there may be some value in and going,
you know,

808
00:45:41.160 --> 00:45:45.990
your resident body isn't ready to take this yet and I'm not just going to hand

809
00:45:45.991 --> 00:45:48.930
it over to you.
You got to earn it.
Well,
I think,
yeah,
yeah.

810
00:45:48.960 --> 00:45:52.080
Well there's something to that on your own for your own good human beings,

811
00:45:52.100 --> 00:45:56.160
you know,
developing discipline and learning how to appreciate intelligence and

812
00:45:56.630 --> 00:46:00.150
[inaudible].
Exactly.
Yeah.
And I think that's the essence of where it starts now.

813
00:46:00.360 --> 00:46:04.110
Now that's the only power grab later that all that being said,

814
00:46:04.260 --> 00:46:07.710
I think sort of the esoteric traditions that you'll find in any,

815
00:46:07.830 --> 00:46:11.850
in any kind of higher order thinking come from a level of discipline and the

816
00:46:11.851 --> 00:46:15.300
idea of discipline,
which is okay because eventually you go,
why am I here?

817
00:46:15.300 --> 00:46:19.170
What am I actually attempting to do here on a cellular or soul level?

818
00:46:19.220 --> 00:46:23.640
Also discipline I think is his maintenance.
It's a maintenance,
um,

819
00:46:23.910 --> 00:46:28.910
sort of a strategy that you can run on your body and keeping your body in a

820
00:46:29.521 --> 00:46:33.210
state where it doesn't fuck with you and doesn't give you a unnecessary

821
00:46:33.211 --> 00:46:37.510
information and stays flat and clean,
keeps it focused in the present.
You're,

822
00:46:37.660 --> 00:46:41.100
if you don't understand hard work and you don't understand like physical

823
00:46:41.101 --> 00:46:42.860
limitations,
you know your dream.
If you don't,

824
00:46:43.080 --> 00:46:46.350
if you've never pushed your endurance and broken yourself,
if you've never been,

825
00:46:46.390 --> 00:46:49.860
then you're not going to know how your body responds and how much of totally

826
00:46:49.861 --> 00:46:51.630
what you do in life is mental.

827
00:46:51.720 --> 00:46:55.380
How much of what you do in life is about your attitude and maintaining a certain

828
00:46:55.381 --> 00:46:59.640
point of focus in a certain way of thinking and a certain resonance of thinking

829
00:46:59.760 --> 00:47:01.250
while that's developed or discipline.

830
00:47:01.280 --> 00:47:04.320
I agree it really good at something and it's really hard.
You work hard at it.

831
00:47:04.350 --> 00:47:07.890
What is the gym but manufactured adversity.

832
00:47:08.550 --> 00:47:12.150
You create an adverse situation that was not there.
These things,

833
00:47:12.210 --> 00:47:15.450
these heavy things do not need to be lifted off the ground right now,

834
00:47:15.930 --> 00:47:19.530
but in the future I may have to deal with that and in the past I have and I'm

835
00:47:19.531 --> 00:47:23.130
aware of those moments where I was at the edge of my experience and I need to

836
00:47:23.490 --> 00:47:26.400
boot beyond that for me to be happy and grow.

837
00:47:26.610 --> 00:47:30.100
So I specifically take time to focus in this moment,
take

838
00:47:30.370 --> 00:47:34.540
<v 5>advert,
potential adversity in past adversity and focus it in this moment.
Go,</v>

839
00:47:34.541 --> 00:47:37.480
I'm going to go to the gym and lift more weight than I've ever lifted before so

840
00:47:37.481 --> 00:47:40.120
that if my body is called to do such a thing,

841
00:47:40.480 --> 00:47:44.320
I'm able to do it comfortably so that I can focus on the higher order element of

842
00:47:44.321 --> 00:47:48.740
it so that the next time I lived 250 pounds,
I'm not going fuck do it.

843
00:47:48.741 --> 00:47:49.450
And 50 pounds,

844
00:47:49.450 --> 00:47:53.230
I'm lifting 250 pounds and I'm focusing on my breath or I'm focusing on my

845
00:47:53.231 --> 00:47:54.940
growth or my strength and or,

846
00:47:54.941 --> 00:47:58.720
or the amount of times I can do it as opposed to everything is hard the first

847
00:47:58.721 --> 00:48:00.100
time.
Um,

848
00:48:00.130 --> 00:48:04.060
so we set up these situations where we are intentionally creating an adverse

849
00:48:04.240 --> 00:48:07.960
experience.
There's no,
you don't have to go to the gym and work out.

850
00:48:08.110 --> 00:48:11.320
You don't have to eat better.
You don't have to do that.
You Go,
all right,

851
00:48:11.321 --> 00:48:13.030
I'm going to quell my own set.

852
00:48:13.031 --> 00:48:16.930
I'm going to discipline my own relaxation reflex because I want to accomplish

853
00:48:16.970 --> 00:48:19.930
anything.
And I think the earth is very similar.

854
00:48:19.990 --> 00:48:24.370
I think spirits create a manufactured adversity.

855
00:48:24.730 --> 00:48:27.490
We create this space which is hard to get through,

856
00:48:27.640 --> 00:48:31.090
that has its challenges and sometimes we make it through and sometimes we fail

857
00:48:31.091 --> 00:48:34.240
and we go back again and again until we get past these lessons and then we

858
00:48:34.241 --> 00:48:38.380
become a higher resident being and we moved to another level of growth that may

859
00:48:38.381 --> 00:48:42.890
not be in space time.
For example.
Is this something you were attached to?
Um,

860
00:48:43.660 --> 00:48:44.350
no.

861
00:48:44.350 --> 00:48:46.150
<v 3>So No.
You know what I'm saying?
I mean,
I'm like,</v>

862
00:48:46.300 --> 00:48:50.140
are you convinced that this is how it goes?
This is how life goes.
Feels right,

863
00:48:50.280 --> 00:48:51.340
feels right.
Yeah.

864
00:48:51.700 --> 00:48:56.700
Sometimes to me it feels like the whole thing is really a mathematical equation

865
00:48:56.980 --> 00:49:01.930
and that math is a language,
the entire existence of,
of the universe,

866
00:49:01.931 --> 00:49:06.931
everything that every little thing is happening and every little action that

867
00:49:07.091 --> 00:49:11.680
happens on earth,
animals,
eating animals,
water pollution,
farms,

868
00:49:11.740 --> 00:49:15.760
emotions,
sex,
drugs,
rock and roll,
all of it together,

869
00:49:16.060 --> 00:49:21.060
each moment and each thing are a part of a gigantic intangible algorithm.

870
00:49:22.330 --> 00:49:25.750
And that everything that has ever happened to you and everything that's ever

871
00:49:25.751 --> 00:49:28.690
happened to anyone that you'll ever meet and anything that's ever happened

872
00:49:28.691 --> 00:49:29.950
that's all connected together.

873
00:49:29.980 --> 00:49:34.630
All of it is all moving the human race towards one direction.

874
00:49:34.840 --> 00:49:38.650
Much like a caterpillar becomes a butterfly and isn't even aware of what the

875
00:49:38.651 --> 00:49:40.900
fuck is stone and gets inside the cocoon.
Sure.

876
00:49:41.500 --> 00:49:46.500
That everything we're doing is moving us into some new direction.

877
00:49:47.170 --> 00:49:51.220
Everything from the beginning to now is moving us into some,
I mean,

878
00:49:51.310 --> 00:49:54.100
if you look at what people are really concentrating on right now at the highest

879
00:49:54.101 --> 00:49:57.550
levels of science,
it's the heart of matter.
Oh yeah.
I mean,

880
00:49:57.551 --> 00:50:01.270
the large hedge funds of the universe.
Yeah.
Right.
Yeah.
The edges of the universe,

881
00:50:01.271 --> 00:50:04.810
the heart of matter,
the,
you know,
the creation of artificial black holes,

882
00:50:04.811 --> 00:50:09.120
the idea of time travel.
We're really getting into the meat of things.
Sure.
But,

883
00:50:09.600 --> 00:50:11.340
<v 5>um,
in many ways,</v>

884
00:50:11.400 --> 00:50:14.130
early human societies thought they were getting to the meat of things and it

885
00:50:14.131 --> 00:50:16.350
just became a new blossoming level,

886
00:50:16.380 --> 00:50:20.170
became a new grade as it were in that school.
You know what I mean?
Society's,

887
00:50:20.210 --> 00:50:22.100
<v 3>yeah.
Right.
But early societies,</v>

888
00:50:22.101 --> 00:50:25.850
if they were constantly searching for new things and constantly trying to

889
00:50:25.851 --> 00:50:29.120
innovate and constantly trying come up with the next new invention,

890
00:50:29.121 --> 00:50:32.960
which they always were,
they're building towards something.
It's,
it's this,

891
00:50:32.961 --> 00:50:35.090
this thirst for innovation.

892
00:50:35.091 --> 00:50:38.480
At a certain point in time it doesn't become a matter of what makes your life

893
00:50:38.481 --> 00:50:42.270
easier.
Innovation becomes a matter of what else can we do,
can we do this?

894
00:50:42.550 --> 00:50:46.640
And it becomes almost like a life of its own instead of you creating things to

895
00:50:46.641 --> 00:50:50.480
help people.
The,
the getting interested in fascinated about these various things.

896
00:50:50.481 --> 00:50:50.811
People say,

897
00:50:50.811 --> 00:50:54.170
well that's how everything gets made and how we have all these advances in

898
00:50:54.171 --> 00:50:56.870
science and medicine and you know,
we can help people.

899
00:50:56.960 --> 00:50:58.100
It's all because of science.

900
00:50:58.101 --> 00:51:00.770
You can't criticize science like no one's criticizing anything.

901
00:51:00.771 --> 00:51:02.290
I'm absolutely not criticizing it,
but I'm sorry,

902
00:51:02.300 --> 00:51:06.980
I'm just looking at it objectively like this idea that we're constantly trying

903
00:51:06.981 --> 00:51:09.320
to come up with the newest,
greatest thing and this,

904
00:51:09.321 --> 00:51:12.280
this idea where we're trying to constantly get to the heart of everything that

905
00:51:12.300 --> 00:51:14.960
the heart of matter,
the the milliseconds after the big bang.

906
00:51:14.961 --> 00:51:16.970
Like that's not going to stop.
That's going to keep going.

907
00:51:17.000 --> 00:51:18.670
<v 5>The,
you know the interesting thing about that mill,</v>

908
00:51:18.710 --> 00:51:22.910
that Big Bang theory was that they reckon they a w I think it was like two weeks

909
00:51:22.911 --> 00:51:23.630
ago,

910
00:51:23.630 --> 00:51:28.630
it came up with this new postulate that seems to be mathematically sound,

911
00:51:29.120 --> 00:51:34.120
that the big bang was not the beginning of anything but another wave in a series

912
00:51:34.971 --> 00:51:37.280
of similar actions and that it,

913
00:51:37.400 --> 00:51:41.990
there was no first beginning that there were many beginnings and it comes in

914
00:51:41.991 --> 00:51:44.420
tides and what we are as human beings,

915
00:51:44.480 --> 00:51:49.480
we're we're plankton who think that every wave is our whole life and thinking

916
00:51:50.961 --> 00:51:55.760
that,
oh,
this waves began when it crested and dies when it hits the shore,

917
00:51:56.040 --> 00:51:56.810
when it's just a,

918
00:51:56.810 --> 00:52:01.010
that same water is reused again and again in an infinite series of waves and

919
00:52:01.011 --> 00:52:05.090
that those plankton live and die in that period until they evolve past a point

920
00:52:05.091 --> 00:52:07.960
where they can do the crawl up on shore,
go out to C and B,

921
00:52:08.000 --> 00:52:09.650
and then their experience becomes longer.

922
00:52:09.800 --> 00:52:14.180
Now my experience on the shore is waves come and hit me every four and I have a

923
00:52:14.181 --> 00:52:19.181
lifespan where five waves hit me or I'm out in the sea and I live five cycles,

924
00:52:21.110 --> 00:52:21.441
you know?

925
00:52:21.441 --> 00:52:25.040
And then I get more advanced and more advanced where I'm moving inland and I

926
00:52:25.041 --> 00:52:26.990
never experienced the flow of the sea anymore.

927
00:52:26.991 --> 00:52:31.250
I have to go back to the sea to recognize there's a cycle at all.

928
00:52:31.251 --> 00:52:35.210
Cause I live in land and now it's weather patterns that are months and months

929
00:52:35.211 --> 00:52:38.360
long and then years and then you know,
as you grow into that span,

930
00:52:38.540 --> 00:52:43.490
and I think right now we're,
we're,
we're that again and again and we,

931
00:52:43.700 --> 00:52:45.470
and it's millennia for us,

932
00:52:46.070 --> 00:52:49.940
but in terms of what life could be,
it's that,

933
00:52:50.350 --> 00:52:53.950
<v 3>mm.
I think our biological need to stay alive,</v>

934
00:52:53.951 --> 00:52:58.120
our instincts to survive,
our instincts,
to think that we are special,

935
00:52:58.121 --> 00:53:00.370
we are important.
We do matter because if we didn't matter,

936
00:53:00.610 --> 00:53:03.460
and if you do look at yourself in the great picture of things and go,
God,

937
00:53:03.461 --> 00:53:06.670
this is all meaningless.
This is pointless.
This is,
you know,
this is,

938
00:53:06.760 --> 00:53:10.330
this is no need for me to even be paying attention here.
Yeah,
no,

939
00:53:10.331 --> 00:53:13.630
you know what I'm saying?
It's,
um,
the idea being that,
you know,

940
00:53:13.631 --> 00:53:17.890
we are this biological entity that does need to stay alive,

941
00:53:17.891 --> 00:53:22.240
but we are aware of how ridiculous that all is all at the same time.

942
00:53:22.600 --> 00:53:24.790
And it's a very conflicting existence.

943
00:53:25.410 --> 00:53:28.890
We have this hardware that is basically the same shit we were using.

944
00:53:28.891 --> 00:53:31.410
We were throwing sticks at woolly mammoths.
I mean,

945
00:53:31.411 --> 00:53:33.240
basically that was 11,000 years ago.

946
00:53:33.480 --> 00:53:36.780
We had the same hardware then as we have now.
That's true.
But we were using,

947
00:53:37.290 --> 00:53:41.010
we're using greater and greater percentages of it.
What do you mean by that

948
00:53:41.380 --> 00:53:44.590
<v 5>brain pan?
Uh,
we still use,
you know,</v>

949
00:53:44.710 --> 00:53:46.420
we're looking at 6% of the human brain.

950
00:53:46.421 --> 00:53:48.610
You're looking at cro magnon man using about three.

951
00:53:48.780 --> 00:53:49.890
<v 3>Yeah.
But is that all right?</v>

952
00:53:49.891 --> 00:53:53.700
Because you know cro-magnon man neanderthal rather had a larger brain than we

953
00:53:53.701 --> 00:53:56.040
did.
Yeah.
And it was dumber than we are.
Right.

954
00:53:56.041 --> 00:53:58.550
But cows have a bigger brain than we do to,
and that he is what,

955
00:53:59.100 --> 00:54:02.280
<v 5>yeah.
Fortunately though they don't.
Sure.
But,
but intellectually it's,</v>

956
00:54:02.281 --> 00:54:05.040
it's not what you have in the brain pan area.

957
00:54:05.041 --> 00:54:07.440
It's how much of it you can use and to what coordination.

958
00:54:07.460 --> 00:54:11.340
But it's really synaptic firing between different areas that court that make it

959
00:54:11.341 --> 00:54:11.760
happen.

960
00:54:11.760 --> 00:54:14.400
<v 3>Right.
But that whole,
you only use 6% of your brain thing.</v>

961
00:54:14.430 --> 00:54:17.310
I don't think it's essential.
Essentially.
I don't think that science,

962
00:54:17.311 --> 00:54:20.730
I think what that is is a misunderstanding of what the brain does.

963
00:54:21.000 --> 00:54:23.970
And we don't really know well,
we're just sort of guessing like there's,

964
00:54:24.150 --> 00:54:28.770
there was some fucking posts that I put up as a study on conservatives.

965
00:54:29.190 --> 00:54:33.120
There's a certain area of conservatives brains that deals with fear that is

966
00:54:33.121 --> 00:54:37.590
larger than on their,
their liberal counterpoints.
Just fascinating.
So I put this,

967
00:54:37.830 --> 00:54:42.690
of course,
a fucking hundred thousand dudes.
You are sold Fulcan Daum you don't,

968
00:54:42.691 --> 00:54:45.450
your goddamn liberal reacted fearfully.

969
00:54:45.540 --> 00:54:48.870
There's one dude sent me like 15 tweets in a row.
By the way,

970
00:54:48.900 --> 00:54:50.670
I'm more of a Republican than I am a democrat.

971
00:54:50.671 --> 00:54:54.570
I would vote for Ron Paul in a heartbeat for president.
I believe in that guy.

972
00:54:54.810 --> 00:54:58.740
Well,
he is.
I mean,
he might not be,
but he is,
he's an old school republican,

973
00:54:59.010 --> 00:55:01.650
you know what I'm saying?
He's a legit conservative.
Okay.

974
00:55:01.750 --> 00:55:05.490
Definitely the fucking guy doesn't even believe in,
I mean he's a creationist,

975
00:55:05.850 --> 00:55:09.540
he's a legit conservative,
but yet I support him.

976
00:55:09.900 --> 00:55:12.960
I support that guy and his ideas more than I do.
Uh,

977
00:55:12.961 --> 00:55:16.520
most liberals who want to just throw money at things,
you know,

978
00:55:16.570 --> 00:55:18.630
I think you look at it,
you know,
it from a,

979
00:55:18.720 --> 00:55:22.860
just a natural perspective of evolution like that the issue isn't throwing money

980
00:55:22.861 --> 00:55:23.770
at things.
Know

981
00:55:24.230 --> 00:55:28.860
<v 5>money,
just tension.
Yeah.
Money's just and disen dis uh,</v>

982
00:55:28.861 --> 00:55:31.380
affected attention basically.
Um,

983
00:55:31.980 --> 00:55:36.480
what we used to do is keep grandma at home and give her our attention in person.

984
00:55:37.050 --> 00:55:41.310
Now there is a way I can give her my attention without having to be there at the

985
00:55:41.311 --> 00:55:45.180
time so I can pay for her to be in a home where other people are paid to give

986
00:55:45.181 --> 00:55:48.450
her attention,
meaning feed her clothes,
her wash her,

987
00:55:48.990 --> 00:55:51.990
provide all this thing and that's money is our way of going.
Look,

988
00:55:52.020 --> 00:55:54.960
I can't give you my genuine emotional attention.

989
00:55:55.170 --> 00:56:00.150
I have gathered a pile of attention and I can give you some of it in this way,

990
00:56:00.151 --> 00:56:01.740
but I can't do it from here.

991
00:56:02.070 --> 00:56:06.720
It's not practical and I have people in my life that actually deserve that at a

992
00:56:06.721 --> 00:56:10.380
higher level.
My actual personal attention and money,
money's just,

993
00:56:10.460 --> 00:56:15.290
it's an intermediary.
It has no worth except ideas and,
and,
and,

994
00:56:15.510 --> 00:56:19.290
<v 3>well,
I mean it does mean this does a lot of things.
I know,
but it does.</v>

995
00:56:19.590 --> 00:56:22.740
It does whatever you want it to do because it's where you put your

996
00:56:24.010 --> 00:56:24.311
<v 2>right.</v>

997
00:56:24.311 --> 00:56:27.760
But what I think what we're talking about though is taxes or talking about what

998
00:56:27.761 --> 00:56:28.570
is the,
you know,

999
00:56:28.570 --> 00:56:31.960
Democrats versus Republicans that they believed that the Democrats want to throw

1000
00:56:31.961 --> 00:56:35.430
more money at.
Sure.
Also,
what do you think your attention needs to go to?

1001
00:56:35.440 --> 00:56:38.290
Real issue is not that the real issue is not where they throw in the money.

1002
00:56:38.291 --> 00:56:40.510
The real issue is where are you getting money from?

1003
00:56:40.540 --> 00:56:44.380
The we're real issue is who the fuck is financing your campaigns?

1004
00:56:44.381 --> 00:56:47.050
Who are you really beholden to once you get into office?

1005
00:56:47.260 --> 00:56:50.830
Are you really acting for the individual?
Because you know you're not,
you're not,

1006
00:56:50.860 --> 00:56:54.640
you're not really the United corporations of America is what it is.
That's,

1007
00:56:54.760 --> 00:56:56.940
that's really what it is.
And the corporation,

1008
00:56:57.020 --> 00:57:00.670
the this distraction of tax cuts in this and that.

1009
00:57:00.671 --> 00:57:05.380
And the real issue is if we were involved in these gigantic wars and we just

1010
00:57:05.381 --> 00:57:08.680
instead spent the same amount of money fixing up the ghettos,

1011
00:57:08.950 --> 00:57:12.060
Jesus fucking Christ,
we could fix everything in your January,

1012
00:57:12.250 --> 00:57:13.320
we would have no problem.

1013
00:57:13.550 --> 00:57:17.290
We will have zero zero crime if you went to you and take the trillions of

1014
00:57:17.290 --> 00:57:20.830
dollars we spend on this war and just create social programs where you hire

1015
00:57:20.831 --> 00:57:25.660
people who are like experienced counselors who are really educated and pay them

1016
00:57:25.661 --> 00:57:27.030
a good salary.
So it's a,

1017
00:57:27.070 --> 00:57:31.270
it's a nice job and help help them with kids that are fatherless and you know,

1018
00:57:31.271 --> 00:57:34.390
develop community after school programs.
That's not fucking rockets.

1019
00:57:34.480 --> 00:57:38.110
Going to Afghanistan.
It's way cheaper than that total.
All this can be done.

1020
00:57:38.111 --> 00:57:40.330
All this can be done if you wanted to really fix the world,

1021
00:57:40.331 --> 00:57:43.450
that's the way to do it.
I totally agree.
These cots in their tax cuts,

1022
00:57:43.451 --> 00:57:46.120
you're missing everything.
That's not what it all is,
where you put it,

1023
00:57:46.180 --> 00:57:49.390
it's right where you need a totally new way of looking at the whole thing.

1024
00:57:49.391 --> 00:57:53.710
You know,
we need to look at the whole thing is we really are all the same thing.

1025
00:57:53.830 --> 00:57:55.420
And just because that guy is over there,

1026
00:57:55.421 --> 00:57:58.180
it doesn't mean he's not connected to you.
Interestingly enough.
Um,

1027
00:57:58.210 --> 00:58:02.340
that's the way the vast majority of the world is going thought form wise.
And uh,

1028
00:58:02.400 --> 00:58:03.070
it,
uh,

1029
00:58:03.070 --> 00:58:06.520
the ruling elite and who have been in power for quite some time are dealing with

1030
00:58:06.521 --> 00:58:08.080
that fact and they're not happy about it.

1031
00:58:08.081 --> 00:58:13.081
But if you look at even statistical trends in life expectancy and family size,

1032
00:58:13.420 --> 00:58:17.530
which used to be the big fear that uh,
you know,
first world nations,
long life,

1033
00:58:17.531 --> 00:58:21.580
small families,
third world nations,
short life,
big families,
this used to be that.

1034
00:58:21.581 --> 00:58:24.550
And that was the big fear.
Here comes the march of the poor people.

1035
00:58:24.760 --> 00:58:29.350
This is what's going to happen statistically over the,
since the 1970s,

1036
00:58:29.680 --> 00:58:33.580
it's,
you can even watch the graph.
There's a guy on a ted conference who showed,

1037
00:58:33.610 --> 00:58:36.010
who does an animated graph of,
of where it's going.

1038
00:58:36.010 --> 00:58:40.250
And it used to be exactly that.
India,
China,
um,
the,
the south,

1039
00:58:40.310 --> 00:58:42.940
Southeast Asian in general,
Africa.

1040
00:58:43.150 --> 00:58:46.990
It was all this like low lifespan way down here and uh,

1041
00:58:46.991 --> 00:58:49.750
and lots of kids.
And then over here in the West,

1042
00:58:50.110 --> 00:58:55.110
very few to kids or less and long lifespans and everybody is marching this

1043
00:58:55.631 --> 00:58:59.830
direction.
Hmm.
Everybody worldwide,
Africa to India,

1044
00:58:59.831 --> 00:59:03.760
to China.
Everybody's going smaller families longer lives.

1045
00:59:04.420 --> 00:59:08.620
And this is,
this is,
uh,
and it's unquestionable.
It's,

1046
00:59:08.621 --> 00:59:13.210
it's shocking to look at how fast because as much as the population bloomed,

1047
00:59:13.390 --> 00:59:16.390
we look at those graphs and go,
Holy Shit,
look at all the new people.

1048
00:59:17.350 --> 00:59:20.650
The shift back,
the other direction is really impressive.

1049
00:59:21.740 --> 00:59:24.550
Natures of mother Fucker,
Dude.
You know,
the,
the,

1050
00:59:24.551 --> 00:59:27.920
the complex structure of all the things it's going on behind the scenes.

1051
00:59:28.160 --> 00:59:31.250
It's so fascinating.
It'll tell,
it'll,
it'll tell you how to be.

1052
00:59:31.280 --> 00:59:34.630
We were talking about,
um,
you know about the,
uh,

1053
00:59:34.631 --> 00:59:39.320
the concept of a attacks berm from when we did the show blocking sperm.

1054
00:59:39.321 --> 00:59:43.010
They also have the ones that run in your Ference.
Yeah,
fighting sermon.

1055
00:59:43.110 --> 00:59:47.060
So much shit going on behind the scenes and we're just running around living our

1056
00:59:47.061 --> 00:59:49.310
lives as if we're in control.
Like you're,

1057
00:59:49.311 --> 00:59:51.320
you are in control of like the eyeballs.

1058
00:59:51.321 --> 00:59:53.240
You got the steering wheel behind the eyeballs,

1059
00:59:53.420 --> 00:59:56.960
all the shit that's going on down there.
You literally,
you can move it.

1060
00:59:56.961 --> 00:59:59.270
You have no idea what the fuck is happening inside.

1061
00:59:59.480 --> 01:00:03.020
You don't have a clue what you're,
yeah.
Holds and nations,
your,

1062
01:00:03.140 --> 01:00:06.950
your consciousness is probably a,
you know,
a mile percentage of your existence,

1063
01:00:07.130 --> 01:00:09.380
of your actual sole existence,

1064
01:00:09.381 --> 01:00:11.390
your metaphysical existence because it couldn't be,

1065
01:00:11.570 --> 01:00:14.510
you couldn't have it all here at once or it would just be overwhelming.

1066
01:00:14.510 --> 01:00:17.990
You would just blast light out of every sale or something because everything

1067
01:00:17.991 --> 01:00:22.760
would be so alive and so full of consciousness at the same time to just a trip

1068
01:00:22.761 --> 01:00:26.270
to think that you contain a bunch of different life forms inside your body,

1069
01:00:26.280 --> 01:00:28.910
like bacterias and right,
and you need them to stay alive.

1070
01:00:29.360 --> 01:00:33.470
That's just nuts in and of itself.
Whole ecosystems inside your body,
right.

1071
01:00:33.471 --> 01:00:35.660
It's like when people get like,
like,
I want to be cremated.

1072
01:00:35.661 --> 01:00:37.600
I don't want be food for magnets and be like,
dude,

1073
01:00:37.620 --> 01:00:41.090
you realize how many living things are eating your skin cells right now,

1074
01:00:41.091 --> 01:00:42.980
and if they didn't,
you would suffocate.
Yeah.

1075
01:00:42.981 --> 01:00:45.770
What you're doing is just being a greedy.
Fuck.
It's right.

1076
01:00:45.771 --> 01:00:48.230
You know you don't want to play,
you know,
like you,
you have to leave.

1077
01:00:48.231 --> 01:00:51.620
So you unplug the Atari and you take it with you,
right?
Exactly.
Yeah.

1078
01:00:51.700 --> 01:00:53.750
Let it melt into the ground with that bacteria.
Eat it.

1079
01:00:53.751 --> 01:00:56.950
That's what he's there for.
Exactly.
It's assistant up and said,
no,

1080
01:00:57.010 --> 01:01:00.380
we got to wrap it in a steel box.
Half the time,
those,

1081
01:01:00.470 --> 01:01:03.110
those habits came because we didn't know when people were dead.
We thought,

1082
01:01:03.111 --> 01:01:06.380
calm is an accident.
You know that stillness was death,

1083
01:01:06.381 --> 01:01:08.810
so we would bury people who are still alive.

1084
01:01:09.110 --> 01:01:11.030
That's where the bells in cemeteries come from.

1085
01:01:11.031 --> 01:01:12.500
They used to have a bell in a cemetery.

1086
01:01:12.830 --> 01:01:16.490
She literally was tied to your string in a string to your finger through a tube

1087
01:01:16.491 --> 01:01:19.350
that went down there.
And if you rank,
if you were alive in the cosmetic,

1088
01:01:19.370 --> 01:01:21.380
fucking come out and dig your ass up.
Crazy.

1089
01:01:22.010 --> 01:01:24.310
But the reason we built harder and harder caskets,

1090
01:01:24.311 --> 01:01:27.360
it's cause we were terrible at telling who was dead.
Oh my God.

1091
01:01:27.590 --> 01:01:29.030
They still fuck up every now and then.

1092
01:01:29.030 --> 01:01:32.750
There's still the Internet story of someone who thought some old lady was dead.

1093
01:01:32.751 --> 01:01:35.780
She pops back.
Oh,
it's gotta be Spaghetti.
Ton of fun.

1094
01:01:37.490 --> 01:01:40.310
Mortality,
man.
That's the motherfucker.
That's what everybody's afraid of.

1095
01:01:40.311 --> 01:01:45.100
That's no one wants to talk about the inevitable end of the trip,
right?

1096
01:01:45.300 --> 01:01:49.460
I mother fucker dude.
Yeah,
but doesn't it make you know all the rest of it?

1097
01:01:49.461 --> 01:01:53.720
A lot more tasty.
It does a gas,
if you can really intellectualize it,

1098
01:01:53.721 --> 01:01:56.210
if he could really wrap your head around it.
But most of us can't.

1099
01:01:56.220 --> 01:02:00.140
I don't think I can.
I don't know.
I pretend to be able to wrap my head around it,

1100
01:02:00.141 --> 01:02:02.000
but the end,
really,
it's when it comes,

1101
01:02:02.001 --> 01:02:04.130
we're all going to be white knuckled and shit in our pants.

1102
01:02:04.460 --> 01:02:06.490
There's no doubt about it,
man.
You know?
No,

1103
01:02:06.491 --> 01:02:11.491
I've seen like I've seen some people go through the transition as it were,

1104
01:02:12.260 --> 01:02:17.060
if you want to call it that.
And I've seen people die and I've like,
uh,
it's,

1105
01:02:17.061 --> 01:02:19.540
it's an,
it's not always that experience.
You know what,

1106
01:02:19.550 --> 01:02:23.160
hear that story about the same Kanutson remember when Sam died?
He,
uh,

1107
01:02:23.220 --> 01:02:26.040
he was laying there and he goes,
why?
He was saying why now,
why now?

1108
01:02:26.041 --> 01:02:29.430
He was looking at somebody in the distance and he said,
why now?

1109
01:02:29.431 --> 01:02:33.000
And then he finally went,
oh,
I see.
Okay.
Yeah.
Thank God.

1110
01:02:33.630 --> 01:02:36.320
And you know about DMT,
right?
Sure.

1111
01:02:36.600 --> 01:02:39.020
The brain releasing it and upon the will,

1112
01:02:39.021 --> 01:02:42.390
theoretically releasing the great moments of great stress or the,

1113
01:02:42.450 --> 01:02:44.490
at the moment of human death,
you know,

1114
01:02:44.610 --> 01:02:47.520
there's no reason why that would be an evolutionary change.

1115
01:02:47.521 --> 01:02:48.930
That would be a consciousness choice,

1116
01:02:48.931 --> 01:02:51.750
but it would not be an evolutionary she has because nobody lives past that
point.

1117
01:02:52.080 --> 01:02:53.850
So you wouldn't develop,
that's a gateway.

1118
01:02:53.910 --> 01:02:57.020
That's a chemical gateway into the next stage,
right?
That it's,

1119
01:02:57.070 --> 01:02:59.070
that helps you kick the body away and move on.

1120
01:02:59.071 --> 01:03:02.820
The thing about the DMT experience is they talk to,
they talk to you a lot.

1121
01:03:02.850 --> 01:03:07.140
They say all kinds of crazy shit to you and they say things to you in a language

1122
01:03:07.290 --> 01:03:11.220
that you don't really hear you.
You just know exactly what the words are.

1123
01:03:11.221 --> 01:03:14.100
The words like appear in front of your face and you know they're saying it
right.

1124
01:03:14.520 --> 01:03:17.730
It's very,
very tricky.
But it's the type of thing that you say,

1125
01:03:17.731 --> 01:03:20.910
well if a guy was dying and as he's telling,
he starts talking,

1126
01:03:20.911 --> 01:03:23.850
well that guy is tripping.
That's what that is.
Right.
You know,

1127
01:03:23.910 --> 01:03:28.380
and then the question comes up,
is it real or is it just,
is he on drugs?
You know,

1128
01:03:28.381 --> 01:03:32.460
is it all just nonsense and is the idea of Nope,
cause it just sexy.
You know,

1129
01:03:32.461 --> 01:03:35.340
the idea that biologic on a purely biological level,

1130
01:03:35.400 --> 01:03:39.240
there is no reason for that to exist because again,
nobody's made what stinks.

1131
01:03:39.360 --> 01:03:41.220
Nobody mates after that point.

1132
01:03:41.430 --> 01:03:45.150
And there's no service to the actual life form to let it go peacefully.

1133
01:03:45.151 --> 01:03:49.180
If anything,
the opposite is true.
If a life at at the end of its life,
if it,
oh,

1134
01:03:49.181 --> 01:03:53.340
it was just about biology,
what you would do is flip out,

1135
01:03:53.370 --> 01:03:56.550
you would be like pris in uh,
in blade runner.

1136
01:03:56.551 --> 01:04:00.810
You just kind of wiggle and freak out because that's all that matters is get

1137
01:04:00.811 --> 01:04:02.610
back to life,
right biologically.

1138
01:04:02.700 --> 01:04:05.630
Cause that's the only way you would live to mate again.
Right?

1139
01:04:05.670 --> 01:04:07.530
And pass on that trait to anyone else.

1140
01:04:07.710 --> 01:04:11.760
But if you have an end of life experience that softens the experience and brings

1141
01:04:11.761 --> 01:04:13.740
you someplace else,
that's a chemical expression,

1142
01:04:13.741 --> 01:04:17.190
which by the way is just energy and information that comes from consciousness

1143
01:04:17.191 --> 01:04:22.140
anyways.
You create through your,
you know,
there's no route to consciousness.

1144
01:04:22.141 --> 01:04:25.240
There's no,
you can't find it and cut it out of the brain doesn't happen.
Right?

1145
01:04:25.320 --> 01:04:26.850
You can cut the expression out of the brain,

1146
01:04:26.851 --> 01:04:29.400
the ability to express it like movement and speech,

1147
01:04:29.401 --> 01:04:31.380
but you can't take the thing itself away.

1148
01:04:31.620 --> 01:04:34.770
Can't look under a petri dish and say this is where thought is.
Well,
you know,

1149
01:04:34.771 --> 01:04:38.580
the idea of it being non local,
you know,
it's like a deep proc show,
Oprah,

1150
01:04:38.610 --> 01:04:43.170
right idea.
He's always pimping of the idea of,
I shouldn't say Cummins,
nice guy.

1151
01:04:43.620 --> 01:04:45.120
Uh,
the idea that you know,

1152
01:04:45.180 --> 01:04:48.690
that consciousness is like something that's out there outside of it and your

1153
01:04:48.691 --> 01:04:53.580
body is sort of a vessel for it holds its cutting loose comfortably because

1154
01:04:53.581 --> 01:04:55.620
you're,
you're going from a totally different,

1155
01:04:55.740 --> 01:04:58.860
it's like coming out of surgery where they give you painkillers.

1156
01:04:59.400 --> 01:05:00.233
They would need to,

1157
01:05:00.270 --> 01:05:05.040
or you would flip out if there's something on the other side going,
look,

1158
01:05:05.041 --> 01:05:05.460
we got it.

1159
01:05:05.460 --> 01:05:08.460
He's going to be in so much pain coming out of this experience into the new

1160
01:05:08.461 --> 01:05:11.900
experience of being healed and different.
Um,
we've got,

1161
01:05:12.050 --> 01:05:14.070
there's got to be a transition between the two.

1162
01:05:14.250 --> 01:05:17.680
So they give you pain medication when you're coming out of anesthesia and we'll

1163
01:05:17.681 --> 01:05:18.010
know at the

1164
01:05:18.010 --> 01:05:20.380
<v 5>beginning,
like when you're,
when you're back at you,</v>

1165
01:05:20.390 --> 01:05:21.760
a lot of people after they're waking up,

1166
01:05:21.761 --> 01:05:24.220
they'll get them right on pain medications essentially,
so that when they're,

1167
01:05:24.400 --> 01:05:29.020
you know,
they're waking up,
they're not in horrible pain.
Oh,
okay.
So,

1168
01:05:29.080 --> 01:05:32.950
um,
in essence,
that's what the DMT would serve.

1169
01:05:33.070 --> 01:05:35.710
If you are looking at it from a consciousness standpoint is that you're moving

1170
01:05:35.711 --> 01:05:38.410
from the earth plane to a non earth plane.
Um,

1171
01:05:38.710 --> 01:05:41.800
or you're just getting fucked up on drugs is nice little treat.
Here you go.

1172
01:05:41.801 --> 01:05:44.680
Life's over.
Go for a ride.
The last trip.
Exactly.

1173
01:05:44.681 --> 01:05:48.190
But why would you treat yourself like that?
You Bud has got some leftover shit.

1174
01:05:48.191 --> 01:05:50.770
Just keep this dude's dying.
Give him a,
give him a shot.
See,

1175
01:05:50.771 --> 01:05:51.604
but it would do the job

1176
01:05:51.700 --> 01:05:54.390
<v 3>well.
A lot of people when they're dying,
they get hard ons too.
That's true.</v>

1177
01:05:54.700 --> 01:05:59.500
There's some sort of a disease.
Like we're,
we're as guys are dying.
God Damn it.

1178
01:05:59.501 --> 01:06:04.480
What is it?
There's something where,
where men as they're dying,

1179
01:06:04.510 --> 01:06:08.290
uh,
regularly get erections right before death.

1180
01:06:08.620 --> 01:06:12.790
And I don't know what it's dying of MFA.
I believe some sort of poison perhaps.

1181
01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:17.270
Fuck me.
I hate not knowing this shit,
but I don't know.

1182
01:06:17.280 --> 01:06:21.130
I'm familiar with this.
But it happens and it's almost like your body is like

1183
01:06:21.140 --> 01:06:25.000
<v 7>one last chance,
right?
Like your body knows</v>

1184
01:06:25.090 --> 01:06:27.850
<v 3>it's over.
Your body is like dealing with an overwhelming,
you know,</v>

1185
01:06:27.851 --> 01:06:29.110
number of things shutting down.
Yeah.

1186
01:06:29.120 --> 01:06:32.630
<v 7>Liver shutting down.
Boss was losing the,
we'll lose central nervous system,</v>

1187
01:06:32.631 --> 01:06:37.370
pressure shift,
fire up the deck,
go out and go play.
So glory.

1188
01:06:37.880 --> 01:06:41.980
You know your body just fucking every fucking burn up.
All right.

1189
01:06:41.981 --> 01:06:43.880
Get getting the balls.
Boys.
Find somebody.

1190
01:06:43.940 --> 01:06:47.160
<v 3>He just as the moment,
the moment of death.
Your Dick is hard as a crowbar.</v>

1191
01:06:47.190 --> 01:06:51.210
Just hoping some hor spots it and just dives on it real quick.
Right.

1192
01:06:51.660 --> 01:06:53.960
I bet it's happened somewhere along the line.
It's probably been in

1193
01:06:54.170 --> 01:06:58.190
<v 5>just write,
it might've been,
um,
you know,
part of the sex rights of,
of,
you know,</v>

1194
01:06:58.590 --> 01:07:00.690
<v 3>higher tradition.
There's a lot of whores out there.</v>

1195
01:07:00.691 --> 01:07:02.820
If there's a hard dick in front of them,
they'll just hop on it.

1196
01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:05.130
They can't help themselves.
There's a lot of girls who liked that,

1197
01:07:05.131 --> 01:07:08.100
especially thousands and thousands of years ago back when they didn't even have

1198
01:07:08.101 --> 01:07:10.380
written language.
Yeah,
of course.
It just dive on Dick.

1199
01:07:10.381 --> 01:07:14.850
So it'd be like made them horse then.
Well it just horse,
they just are.
No,

1200
01:07:14.851 --> 01:07:16.780
they're not.
They're just dive in on Dixon versions.

1201
01:07:16.800 --> 01:07:18.450
They might not even know that guy that might be nurses.

1202
01:07:18.451 --> 01:07:20.250
They might be in the room while he's crying,

1203
01:07:20.330 --> 01:07:25.330
<v 5>paid what you mean is slut and sluts and eliminate some.</v>

1204
01:07:25.640 --> 01:07:29.290
That as a concept eliminates the choice on the woman's part that she said,

1205
01:07:29.470 --> 01:07:31.920
I'm out broken and doesn't derive pleasure from it or whatever.
It makes

1206
01:07:32.730 --> 01:07:33.720
<v 3>fascinating concept,</v>

1207
01:07:33.721 --> 01:07:38.721
but in Spain they force prostitutes to start wearing yellow reflective vests

1208
01:07:38.910 --> 01:07:40.620
because too many of them were getting hit by cars

1209
01:07:42.070 --> 01:07:44.770
<v 5>because you know they hang out in this a head pick up.</v>

1210
01:07:44.800 --> 01:07:47.850
That's hilarious because prostitution is legal in Spain.
Yeah.

1211
01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:51.420
They forced these chicks and micro set everybody like look at for a good with it

1212
01:07:51.430 --> 01:07:53.800
and then reflect your vest and a helmet and God,
yeah.

1213
01:07:53.920 --> 01:07:56.330
<v 3>You mentioned getting a blow job from a chick with a reflective vest.</v>

1214
01:07:57.040 --> 01:07:59.220
A fuck is wrong.
Low for the cone zone.

1215
01:07:59.240 --> 01:08:02.980
Who's sitting there as the cars drive by and the lights from their head lights

1216
01:08:02.981 --> 01:08:04.480
flash off that reflective vest.

1217
01:08:04.690 --> 01:08:08.370
He started wondering about your choices or bad breath,
blow job,

1218
01:08:08.390 --> 01:08:10.210
stinking up your fucking car and you're like,

1219
01:08:10.360 --> 01:08:14.530
how many loads did she have fermenting in her mouth right now on how many

1220
01:08:14.531 --> 01:08:18.320
crossing get mistaken for hookers out there.
A lot.
Yeah,

1221
01:08:18.321 --> 01:08:20.900
they better where some low shoes crossing guards.

1222
01:08:20.901 --> 01:08:22.640
You know these to try to be all sexy and shit.

1223
01:08:22.641 --> 01:08:26.180
You can't pull that off into your heels are out.
No clear.

1224
01:08:26.181 --> 01:08:29.690
Here's for crossing gardens.
I'm glad we settled all this,
which is the good part.

1225
01:08:29.870 --> 01:08:31.460
You know,
we fucking locked it all down.

1226
01:08:31.461 --> 01:08:34.670
Dude was a lot of confusion when we started this podcast.

1227
01:08:34.670 --> 01:08:38.480
I think a lot of has been cleared.
A lot of apprehension.
A lot of concern.

1228
01:08:38.481 --> 01:08:40.670
Nervousness.
Yeah man.
About,
yeah.

1229
01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:44.200
You know whether or not we're here for any particular reasons.
You know,

1230
01:08:44.450 --> 01:08:46.490
an interesting thing to talk about and speculate,

1231
01:08:46.491 --> 01:08:50.240
but ultimately the most important thing is the quality of the experience.

1232
01:08:50.241 --> 01:08:53.180
While you're here,
you know,
have fun while you're here.
I agree.

1233
01:08:53.210 --> 01:08:56.480
That's because it can be fun.
That is the one thing that you can control.

1234
01:08:56.670 --> 01:08:59.240
That here can be fun.
If you surround yourself with cool people,

1235
01:08:59.270 --> 01:09:01.070
if you surround yourself with positive people,

1236
01:09:01.190 --> 01:09:03.200
you do what you're supposed to be doing in life,
you know,

1237
01:09:03.201 --> 01:09:07.370
find a path that makes you feel happy.
You can ultimately,
you can have,

1238
01:09:07.371 --> 01:09:11.390
this can be a good goddamn time.
Absolutely.
That's why we need directions.

1239
01:09:11.420 --> 01:09:11.751
You know,

1240
01:09:11.751 --> 01:09:16.430
we need like someone needs to like help people figure out from the right

1241
01:09:16.440 --> 01:09:20.600
something like the Georgia stones,
those,
those fucking,

1242
01:09:20.840 --> 01:09:23.330
those um,
you ever seen those things?
There's like the,

1243
01:09:23.331 --> 01:09:25.760
they call it the Georgia Stonehenge,
but uh,

1244
01:09:25.790 --> 01:09:28.550
the Georgia wisdom stones or something like that and it's a,

1245
01:09:28.551 --> 01:09:32.930
it was in the 1970 somebody had it constructed in 12 different languages in case

1246
01:09:32.931 --> 01:09:33.764
of an apocalypse.

1247
01:09:33.920 --> 01:09:38.810
There's these gigantic stone tablets with all these different directions on how

1248
01:09:38.811 --> 01:09:42.350
to,
uh,
live Georgia Guidestones I believe it is.
Oh,
nice.
Right.

1249
01:09:42.440 --> 01:09:44.780
Pull that shit up so you can Georgia.
Yeah,
yeah.

1250
01:09:44.781 --> 01:09:47.990
In the state of Georgia or the country of Georgia state in America.

1251
01:09:47.991 --> 01:09:51.230
Some guy who is a thing,
some on,
they don't know if it was,

1252
01:09:51.380 --> 01:09:54.080
they don't know exactly who he is because a,
uh,
was it again,

1253
01:09:54.230 --> 01:09:58.700
it was anonymous Georgia Guidestones that's cool.
It's fascinating.
Yeah.
And it's,

1254
01:09:58.701 --> 01:10:02.270
you know,
keep humanity to under 500 million people worldwide.
That's one of the,

1255
01:10:02.660 --> 01:10:05.240
one of the principals share,
which is a good one,
you know,

1256
01:10:05.241 --> 01:10:09.100
which is what an agoraphobic a millionaire who would make a bunch of Guidestones

1257
01:10:09.110 --> 01:10:11.300
would write with true.
But you know,

1258
01:10:11.360 --> 01:10:14.180
there is a certain amount of resources in a certain amount of people and when

1259
01:10:14.181 --> 01:10:16.580
the people go over the resources,
it's really not,

1260
01:10:16.581 --> 01:10:18.820
I would say get off planet then.
No.
Yeah,
but it's,

1261
01:10:18.830 --> 01:10:22.700
that's how that seems way harder than you're saying.
That seems like super,

1262
01:10:22.701 --> 01:10:25.280
super tired.
There's micro meteors out there,

1263
01:10:25.281 --> 01:10:28.760
there's 900,000 near Earth objects just between Mars and Jupiter.
Right.

1264
01:10:28.970 --> 01:10:32.380
And any one of them will just fuck you up.
Right.
You know,
you're just,

1265
01:10:32.420 --> 01:10:36.020
you're out there flying around in a big shoes to live at the basis of volcanoes

1266
01:10:36.021 --> 01:10:40.370
because it was warm,
like still doing Hawaii.
I know.
Shit.
You know what I mean?

1267
01:10:40.390 --> 01:10:43.520
In so far as culture,
we come a long way in that regard.
We're not,
you know,

1268
01:10:43.640 --> 01:10:46.970
there's a lot of shit on this planet that can fucking kill you randomly.

1269
01:10:47.100 --> 01:10:48.770
And then we're still out numbering everything.

1270
01:10:48.771 --> 01:10:53.771
I think it'd be be quicker to protect yourself and safer and more likely to

1271
01:10:53.991 --> 01:10:56.570
protect yourself from the shit that they can fuck you up here.

1272
01:10:57.050 --> 01:11:00.200
Except for the big ones like asteroid impacts,
they're separate.

1273
01:11:00.201 --> 01:11:03.110
One of the things you're gonna do is you're going to run into,
um,

1274
01:11:03.290 --> 01:11:07.610
life expansion that's going to out weigh the space.
And that's like saying,
look,

1275
01:11:07.700 --> 01:11:10.400
the ocean,
it's fucking dangerous.
Our boats,

1276
01:11:10.430 --> 01:11:14.010
our little brown things with paddles,
there's no fucking

1277
01:11:14.010 --> 01:11:17.400
<v 5>way we're getting from Hawaii where there's lots of pineapple and everything is</v>

1278
01:11:17.401 --> 01:11:17.821
fine.

1279
01:11:17.821 --> 01:11:21.870
As long as we have our little march to the top of the volcano and dump off done

1280
01:11:21.890 --> 01:11:25.620
the,
the useless people every once in awhile or you know,
uh,

1281
01:11:25.690 --> 01:11:29.070
a minor plague wipes out a decent number of us on a cycle.

1282
01:11:29.370 --> 01:11:31.650
We don't need to head to the other continents.

1283
01:11:31.651 --> 01:11:35.130
We don't need to express ourselves and find out what the rest of the earth is

1284
01:11:35.131 --> 01:11:38.700
like.
We have 98% of this world is unexplored in a lot of ways,

1285
01:11:38.701 --> 01:11:42.810
especially in the oceans.
Like we have no idea even hear what's going on.

1286
01:11:42.811 --> 01:11:47.811
And had we had that island mentality then we wouldn't be the expressions that we

1287
01:11:47.821 --> 01:11:52.350
are now.
And I think the same thing applies earth,
you know,
the,

1288
01:11:52.351 --> 01:11:55.110
this island earth concept.
You know,
why not,

1289
01:11:55.970 --> 01:11:56.840
<v 3>man?
I don't know.</v>

1290
01:11:57.080 --> 01:12:00.020
I just don't know if we're really going to be fucking flying through the galaxy

1291
01:12:00.200 --> 01:12:04.100
landed on new planets to starting up a new civilization.
Do you,
I mean,

1292
01:12:04.101 --> 01:12:07.430
think about how much of a variation in temperature we get on this planet.

1293
01:12:07.550 --> 01:12:08.390
Just a little bear.

1294
01:12:08.391 --> 01:12:13.391
The one between winter and summer and I was in Winnipeg and a student stand up

1295
01:12:13.490 --> 01:12:17.090
up there.
And uh,
whenever I'm in Canada,
I was asked people like,
hey,

1296
01:12:17.091 --> 01:12:18.620
how cold does it get here in the winter?

1297
01:12:19.280 --> 01:12:24.230
And the guy said 50 fucking degrees below zero 50.

1298
01:12:24.470 --> 01:12:24.830
Yeah.

1299
01:12:24.830 --> 01:12:29.670
Like just the idea that that can happen on this planet and the same planet were

1300
01:12:29.671 --> 01:12:34.640
an la at 70,
what is it in January 70?
Yeah.
What is it in February 70?
It's 70.

1301
01:12:34.641 --> 01:12:38.740
Go to Hawaii 80.
What is it in March 80?
What's an in July 80?
Sure.

1302
01:12:39.110 --> 01:12:42.020
Winnepeg minus 50.
Yeah.

1303
01:12:42.021 --> 01:12:45.630
And people have been living there or centuries.

1304
01:12:45.800 --> 01:12:47.930
I played in a theater that was like a couple hundred dollars.

1305
01:12:47.960 --> 01:12:52.800
<v 5>What?
I mean,
so,
um,
but go back to human beings,</v>

1306
01:12:52.801 --> 01:12:56.940
pre clothing and the winter comes wipes everybody the fuck.

1307
01:12:57.130 --> 01:13:00.640
<v 3>Well,
they never know there they lived in Africa,
pre clothing almost.</v>

1308
01:13:00.641 --> 01:13:02.350
Nobody ever really,
really was anywhere else.

1309
01:13:02.470 --> 01:13:05.530
<v 5>Right?
Well,
we spread it and we spread out and a lot of people die and die.</v>

1310
01:13:05.870 --> 01:13:09.490
I never get outside of the box.
We reached the limit of our physical experience.

1311
01:13:09.491 --> 01:13:13.910
What we could actually survive.
We got in,
we,
we made clothes.

1312
01:13:13.930 --> 01:13:17.350
Now we have these like reflective astronaut material that people can,
you know,

1313
01:13:17.351 --> 01:13:20.290
walk around and almost loose like jackets and almost that kind of weather and,

1314
01:13:20.350 --> 01:13:24.710
and be as warm as anybody wearing 16 animal pelts were,
you know,
uh,

1315
01:13:25.030 --> 01:13:25.863
300 years.

1316
01:13:25.870 --> 01:13:28.090
<v 3>Did you see that?
They've found a new,
um,</v>

1317
01:13:28.110 --> 01:13:32.560
into human evidence of the oldest human hundred 40,000 years old,
I think.
No,
no.

1318
01:13:32.561 --> 01:13:36.080
The one in Israel is more than that.
It's 400,000 year old,
right?

1319
01:13:36.140 --> 01:13:39.330
Homosapien the teeth.
Yeah.
Yeah.
It's fascinating.
Shit,
man.

1320
01:13:39.340 --> 01:13:41.920
They really don't even know how old along we've been around.
The real,

1321
01:13:41.950 --> 01:13:45.220
the hard part about it is when people don't understand is that it's not easy to

1322
01:13:45.221 --> 01:13:47.980
make a fossil.
Like things have to go wrong.
To make a fossil,

1323
01:13:47.981 --> 01:13:49.630
you have to get caught in a landslide.
Totally.

1324
01:13:49.660 --> 01:13:52.600
Like most of the time when you die,
things eat you and that's a wrap.

1325
01:13:52.601 --> 01:13:53.500
There's no bones left.

1326
01:13:53.540 --> 01:13:57.100
Like when we find dinosaurs or we find any fossilized animals,

1327
01:13:57.101 --> 01:13:58.620
it's because they died in someone.

1328
01:13:58.621 --> 01:14:01.300
Like there's some big thing that sealed them in,
right?
I mean,

1329
01:14:01.301 --> 01:14:05.020
you think about the mass of the earth and all the areas of,

1330
01:14:05.080 --> 01:14:09.760
of levels and levels of layers of dirt and how many things might be under there

1331
01:14:09.761 --> 01:14:12.970
that we're not even aware of was actually probably a bunch of species that we

1332
01:14:12.971 --> 01:14:16.810
haven't discovered yet.
Question,
including,
you know,
different,
different animals,

1333
01:14:16.811 --> 01:14:18.430
different,
uh,
hominids.
You know,

1334
01:14:18.431 --> 01:14:21.070
they found that new new type of human being recently,

1335
01:14:21.280 --> 01:14:24.190
they believed there were several different branches of human brains that

1336
01:14:24.191 --> 01:14:26.440
interbred but they were totally different species.

1337
01:14:26.520 --> 01:14:29.970
<v 5>Yeah.
Well they got the concept of modern man mating with neanderthals and the,</v>

1338
01:14:30.090 --> 01:14:35.090
and the interesting thing was the male modern humans fucked neanderthal women.

1339
01:14:36.420 --> 01:14:39.660
Neanderthal men did not fuck modern women.
Wow.

1340
01:14:39.870 --> 01:14:41.850
Because it was a decision that it was like,

1341
01:14:41.880 --> 01:14:46.860
literally guys will fuck whoever and the women are like,
no fucking way.

1342
01:14:46.861 --> 01:14:51.090
I'm not going to let that asshole.
Fuck me.
And that was,
that was,
that was,

1343
01:14:51.600 --> 01:14:54.900
yeah,
that was like,
and if you look at the DNA strands,

1344
01:14:55.110 --> 01:14:59.070
it becomes increasingly clear that it was male modern humans who are fucking

1345
01:14:59.071 --> 01:15:01.520
neanderthal chicks.
And neanderthal.
Uh,

1346
01:15:02.180 --> 01:15:05.550
if this was anywhere around the same time alcohol was invented,

1347
01:15:06.070 --> 01:15:09.270
wonder if there was somehow your caucus,
the original,
you know,

1348
01:15:09.280 --> 01:15:12.910
could you imagine if that could be proven that the first guy to fucking knee and

1349
01:15:12.920 --> 01:15:13.753
Saul was hammered?

1350
01:15:17.100 --> 01:15:20.590
I was watching this fucking enlisting to country western,
right.

1351
01:15:20.840 --> 01:15:24.710
Just fucking sit in the back of his pickup truck,
cracking paps for rebuttal.

1352
01:15:24.840 --> 01:15:28.320
I'll think I'm going to fuck her.
Right.
Like that woman who,

1353
01:15:28.530 --> 01:15:31.290
who the other day do you hear about that one when he was like threatening

1354
01:15:31.291 --> 01:15:32.101
somebody with a knife?

1355
01:15:32.101 --> 01:15:36.790
Somebody's gonna eat my pussy or I'm going to kill somebody.
Why?
Yes.
Was Ready.

1356
01:15:36.810 --> 01:15:40.590
She was,
she was she,
she got arrested.
Where was that?
She had,
I don't know.

1357
01:15:40.591 --> 01:15:42.220
She had a knife and she was threatening these two guys.

1358
01:15:42.280 --> 01:15:45.360
One of them doesn't the eater and he think it was a Russian lady.

1359
01:15:45.510 --> 01:15:49.910
I want to say Russia.
They are my favorites wasn't here in America.
Yes.

1360
01:15:50.490 --> 01:15:54.330
We looked that up on Google.
I gotta take a Piss.
Do we have Jesus?
Hold on,

1361
01:15:54.360 --> 01:15:57.690
keep talking amongst yourself.
I'll be right back.
Coconut waters gate.
All right.

1362
01:15:58.820 --> 01:16:03.790
<v 3>Great.
Cool.
How sparks getting up and go to the bathroom?</v>

1363
01:16:03.791 --> 01:16:06.400
Ladies and gentlemen,
cover?
Um,

1364
01:16:06.640 --> 01:16:10.090
if somebody is going to eat my pussy or I'm going to cut your fucking throat.

1365
01:16:10.530 --> 01:16:15.020
That's what she said.
Her name was Melissa.
This is a a post on the Rogan board.

1366
01:16:15.040 --> 01:16:19.930
My message board from a man named shark,
not an excellent poster who posts many,

1367
01:16:19.931 --> 01:16:23.460
many quality things and I appreciate him very much.
And the picture,

1368
01:16:23.480 --> 01:16:26.200
this woman is fantastic and the name of the threat is someone's going to eat my

1369
01:16:26.201 --> 01:16:28.450
pussy or I'm going to cut your fucking throat.

1370
01:16:29.260 --> 01:16:31.540
And it says meet Melissa Lee Williams.

1371
01:16:31.900 --> 01:16:36.670
West Virginia woman 41 is facing assault and weapons charges after allegedly

1372
01:16:36.671 --> 01:16:41.671
waving a knife at two men who declined her demands to engage in sexual conduct

1373
01:16:41.891 --> 01:16:43.570
at a West Virginia Motor in

1374
01:16:45.430 --> 01:16:48.490
the October 22nd incident is detailed in an amusing gross.

1375
01:16:48.730 --> 01:16:53.560
Jackson County Sheriff's Department report IX excerpted here according to the

1376
01:16:53.561 --> 01:16:57.190
investigator's Williams who lives four doors down from her estranged husband at

1377
01:16:57.191 --> 01:17:02.050
the 77 motor inn showed up at his door and as Danny Williams and another man to

1378
01:17:02.080 --> 01:17:05.590
eat my pussy.
And quotes at this point,

1379
01:17:05.680 --> 01:17:07.930
William's pictured in the mugshot.
By the way,

1380
01:17:07.931 --> 01:17:10.040
if you haven't seen wonderful whites of

1381
01:17:10.040 --> 01:17:13.510
<v 2>West Virginia,
this will be much more funny.
If you've seen that movie,</v>

1382
01:17:13.511 --> 01:17:15.800
you've seen it,
right,
Brian?
Now.
Oh my God,
I've got a copy for you.

1383
01:17:15.860 --> 01:17:17.510
I've got a copy.
You've got two copies I bought.

1384
01:17:17.511 --> 01:17:19.550
Just hand handout sweet to people that don't have it.
Sweet.

1385
01:17:19.670 --> 01:17:23.540
It's fucking brilliant.
West Virginia,
man,
the you,

1386
01:17:23.570 --> 01:17:27.350
have you seen the wonderful whites of West Virginia?
All right.
You got one too.

1387
01:17:27.351 --> 01:17:28.790
I'll give you a copy of it too.
I got to car.

1388
01:17:28.850 --> 01:17:32.180
I buy copies just to give people cause it's so goddamn good.
Yeah.

1389
01:17:32.181 --> 01:17:34.370
When may have Miller was here,
I gave him a copy.
I've given a couple of people.

1390
01:17:34.430 --> 01:17:38.330
Eddie Bravo gave him a copy.
It's fucking the greatest documentary of all time.

1391
01:17:38.331 --> 01:17:41.750
It's just brilliant because it follows these people in West Virginia who are

1392
01:17:41.751 --> 01:17:46.510
basically savages.
They might as well be living in Liberia,
man.
It's just the,

1393
01:17:46.760 --> 01:17:50.240
uh,
West Virginia version of Africa.
Okay.

1394
01:17:50.241 --> 01:17:52.730
They're savage,
right?
Well,

1395
01:17:52.731 --> 01:17:55.550
the interesting thing that I've always said that time travel is totally fucking

1396
01:17:55.551 --> 01:17:59.630
possible if you just drive the right direction because literally you can drive

1397
01:17:59.631 --> 01:18:03.590
into New York City and be in the future.
Yeah.

1398
01:18:04.120 --> 01:18:08.690
And then you can drive to West Virginia in the mountains and be 150 years in the

1399
01:18:08.691 --> 01:18:12.050
fucking past man or in a totally different reality.

1400
01:18:12.051 --> 01:18:14.390
Like I've always heard that the apocalypse is here.

1401
01:18:14.391 --> 01:18:17.830
It just hasn't reached your door yet.
There's a lot of spots in the world really.

1402
01:18:17.870 --> 01:18:20.090
A comes and goes and little flare in Afghanistan.

1403
01:18:20.091 --> 01:18:22.370
Tell me the apocalypse isn't there,
Tom.
It's not there.

1404
01:18:22.371 --> 01:18:25.100
If you're a fucking soldier in Afghanistan right now,
tell me it's not there.

1405
01:18:25.250 --> 01:18:26.790
Tell me it's not there if you're in,
I rented.

1406
01:18:26.810 --> 01:18:30.470
That place hasn't changed in exactly,
but still the apocalypse.

1407
01:18:30.471 --> 01:18:31.690
If you had to live there right now,
well,

1408
01:18:31.691 --> 01:18:35.320
the apocalypse you imagine if you were out in the goat through the fucking the

1409
01:18:35.321 --> 01:18:38.120
mountains.
Yeah.
Armageddon.
Apocalypse is a difference.

1410
01:18:38.240 --> 01:18:41.100
Apocalypses when things shall be revealed,
it literally means a,

1411
01:18:41.101 --> 01:18:43.700
a vision really pack a lot.
It was like the end.

1412
01:18:43.701 --> 01:18:46.820
Know the where it's Armageddon is the end and the bottom club Armageddon comes

1413
01:18:46.821 --> 01:18:50.390
forward harm again,
which is a mountain in Israel where the,
the uh,

1414
01:18:50.391 --> 01:18:54.700
Israeli soldiers will stage the final battle to take back the,
uh,
the,

1415
01:18:54.780 --> 01:18:57.470
the mosque.
That's Aaron rebuild the temple of the mountain.

1416
01:18:57.770 --> 01:19:02.060
I'll sparks dropping knowledge.
Pictures.
You didn't know about all this.

1417
01:19:02.061 --> 01:19:02.721
I had no idea.

1418
01:19:02.721 --> 01:19:06.200
I always equated Armageddon and apocalypse to be basically the same thing.

1419
01:19:06.201 --> 01:19:09.380
Just as nonsensical idea.
That one is the one we're going to end once.

1420
01:19:09.381 --> 01:19:11.810
The happy ones,
the dark,
but they,
they're not,
they don't talk her dark.

1421
01:19:11.811 --> 01:19:13.550
They don't Armageddon.
Armageddon is the battle.

1422
01:19:13.610 --> 01:19:15.380
That's the battle which the apocalypse is.

1423
01:19:15.381 --> 01:19:20.381
When is after the four horsemen ride and God reveals himself four horsemen.

1424
01:19:21.110 --> 01:19:25.460
So you know that Unicorns are in the Bible.
King James Bible Unicorns.

1425
01:19:25.670 --> 01:19:29.810
Wow.
Somebody put that on the rug and board today too.
Yeah.
What the fighting man?

1426
01:19:29.990 --> 01:19:30.823
Yeah.
For Real.

1427
01:19:30.840 --> 01:19:34.160
Well that's not weird compared to the rest of the weird shit that's in there.

1428
01:19:34.200 --> 01:19:37.920
It made great,
but it's whenever there's new weird shit,
it's so,

1429
01:19:37.940 --> 01:19:42.110
it's so contrast.
Regular retail giants,
fucking women,

1430
01:19:42.410 --> 01:19:47.060
you know,
the Nephilim and like seriously angel wars,

1431
01:19:47.270 --> 01:19:51.320
like the angel wars.
I mean to,
I was talking about that a,

1432
01:19:51.321 --> 01:19:55.760
that stupid show that I watch all the time.
Um,
uh,
ancient aliens.
Oh yeah.

1433
01:19:55.761 --> 01:20:00.440
They're always totally proposing all these nutty Zachary Zachary [inaudible]

1434
01:20:00.441 --> 01:20:03.990
where a lot of it,
yeah.
12th planet and all that stuff.
Yeah,

1435
01:20:04.040 --> 01:20:06.200
that's all fascinating stuff.
When he's seven.

1436
01:20:06.230 --> 01:20:09.900
And what does a 25 100 year elliptical orbit of a planet that comes back into

1437
01:20:09.901 --> 01:20:10.860
range?
Actually,

1438
01:20:10.861 --> 01:20:14.940
it's 30003000500 years and it's come and it's close.

1439
01:20:15.600 --> 01:20:19.620
It's within flying distance right now.
The idea is ridiculous.
I mean,

1440
01:20:19.621 --> 01:20:22.350
the idea that they wouldn't have spotted it,
but you know,
I mean,

1441
01:20:22.351 --> 01:20:24.990
if something's going to be here in 2012,
believe me folks,

1442
01:20:24.991 --> 01:20:28.260
the fucking things going to be giant in the sky and headed our way,

1443
01:20:28.560 --> 01:20:31.710
billion miles an hour,
not happening.
Something bigger than,
you know,
earth.

1444
01:20:31.770 --> 01:20:34.980
Are you kidding me?
That close.
But you know,
look,

1445
01:20:34.981 --> 01:20:39.390
we know for sure that planets collide.
We know galaxies collide.

1446
01:20:39.391 --> 01:20:41.430
We know that there was two models of the earth.

1447
01:20:41.431 --> 01:20:43.650
There's earth one and earth to heaven and earth.

1448
01:20:43.651 --> 01:20:48.060
One didn't have a moon and we got hit by something and knocked them planet
sized.

1449
01:20:48.180 --> 01:20:48.721
Right.
You know,

1450
01:20:48.721 --> 01:20:53.400
in this chunk of us spun in the sky and became the motion and the ocean actually

1451
01:20:53.401 --> 01:20:55.980
is the gap where it used to be.
That's why it's so gigantic.

1452
01:20:56.220 --> 01:20:59.150
You've ever heard the hollow moon theory?
The holiday?
Yeah.

1453
01:20:59.160 --> 01:21:02.940
That the red moon rings when they land things on it.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1454
01:21:03.060 --> 01:21:05.250
That's one of the other reasons why they rang like a bell.

1455
01:21:05.251 --> 01:21:09.130
They why they bombed the surface for water.
Hmm.
Was that,
you know,

1456
01:21:09.740 --> 01:21:14.010
I guess you the ideal that's artificial.
That's hilarious.

1457
01:21:14.220 --> 01:21:16.560
Did you imagine if it was,
you know,
if we found out that it was like,

1458
01:21:16.561 --> 01:21:19.650
I can imagine God damn satellite that they put there,
just cover it with dirt.

1459
01:21:19.651 --> 01:21:23.160
They're stupid.
They won't know and just watch us.
Totally.

1460
01:21:23.190 --> 01:21:26.700
We're a fucking ant farm or the g the biggest reality show ever.

1461
01:21:26.940 --> 01:21:29.440
That's where the universe is.

1462
01:21:29.441 --> 01:21:33.540
Your and show the fucking light every day or the Kardashians that the universe

1463
01:21:33.660 --> 01:21:37.680
aliens sit down in lounges and drink cappuccinos and laughter.

1464
01:21:37.681 --> 01:21:41.730
Dicks off at dancing around on television.
Have you seen family,

1465
01:21:41.790 --> 01:21:44.460
family jewels that kiss?
Uh,
Gene Simmons,

1466
01:21:45.060 --> 01:21:48.810
Gene Simmons and Gene Simmons came to my show so I will not say anything bad

1467
01:21:48.811 --> 01:21:49.680
about,
I'm a,
I'm a fan.

1468
01:21:49.681 --> 01:21:52.320
I've been a kid having a kiss fan since out of your five years old,

1469
01:21:52.321 --> 01:21:53.910
we need to show to like,
yeah.
All right,

1470
01:21:53.911 --> 01:21:57.820
so what now this shows obviously fake and I,
they don't really try all father,

1471
01:21:58.180 --> 01:22:01.020
his father knows best.
Isn't that bullet cheaper production value.
Yeah it isn't.

1472
01:22:01.021 --> 01:22:05.010
That isn't that buggy cause it's like that's weird in between kind of shows that

1473
01:22:05.030 --> 01:22:08.050
I keep on thinking that it's supposed to be sold.
I'm not real.

1474
01:22:08.130 --> 01:22:09.300
What's real is personality.

1475
01:22:09.301 --> 01:22:11.970
When I'm really saying is personally I don't give a shit if the circumstances

1476
01:22:11.971 --> 01:22:15.240
real or most times circumstances to fucking boring to watch.

1477
01:22:15.241 --> 01:22:17.130
So it's setting something up.
Ultimately.

1478
01:22:17.370 --> 01:22:20.910
What's the difference between that and taking a comedian who you watch on stage

1479
01:22:20.940 --> 01:22:23.880
who's very funny,
either off the cuff or and written material and going,

1480
01:22:23.881 --> 01:22:27.720
let's create a fake family for him based on the characters he created and watch

1481
01:22:27.721 --> 01:22:29.340
them react to things that are already set up.

1482
01:22:29.340 --> 01:22:32.050
It's even more embarrassing when you write a script for it,
right?

1483
01:22:32.130 --> 01:22:34.830
Because there's no variable at all.

1484
01:22:34.860 --> 01:22:38.610
I guess it's tricking yourself into reminding yourself to take it like that.

1485
01:22:38.611 --> 01:22:42.750
I guess I,
when I watch it,
I just,
it boggles my mind like I have,

1486
01:22:42.751 --> 01:22:45.420
I need to try not to like those shows.
I find them boring.

1487
01:22:45.421 --> 01:22:50.010
I watched a married to rock the other day.
I watched a celebrity rehab,

1488
01:22:50.190 --> 01:22:54.210
which is fascinating to me because no one's famous,
right?
I mean,

1489
01:22:54.211 --> 01:22:57.810
Eric Roberts is the most famous one.
Nobody gets rehabbed,

1490
01:22:57.870 --> 01:23:01.920
everybody ends up fucked up again.
You know,
the maybe help them a little bit,

1491
01:23:01.921 --> 01:23:05.040
you know,
like I'm not,
I'm not a total antedoctal drew guy.

1492
01:23:05.060 --> 01:23:06.160
A lot of people say what he does

1493
01:23:06.160 --> 01:23:06.851
<v 3>is on ethical,</v>

1494
01:23:06.851 --> 01:23:10.000
that you're not supposed to take people and put them in the public eye and make

1495
01:23:10.001 --> 01:23:13.360
them a part of a reality show where they're going through such a serious

1496
01:23:13.570 --> 01:23:16.480
situation like that choice.
I understand that,

1497
01:23:16.481 --> 01:23:19.420
but what people are saying is it's unethical because the,
the,
the,

1498
01:23:19.421 --> 01:23:22.600
the pressure of the cameras and the weirdness of the whole experience,

1499
01:23:22.840 --> 01:23:25.540
it's not a,
and sit in the wrong direction.
The wrong direction.
Exactly.

1500
01:23:25.560 --> 01:23:28.860
<v 5>I totally agree.
And I'm not a fan and I have drew,
no,
and I,</v>

1501
01:23:28.861 --> 01:23:30.340
and for a long time I was like,
he's,

1502
01:23:30.450 --> 01:23:33.360
he's a bigger drug pusher than a lot of the people that he does cause on

1503
01:23:33.370 --> 01:23:36.840
Loveline,
on and on and on.
It was just,
what meds are you on?

1504
01:23:36.841 --> 01:23:39.350
Have you checked your dosage?
You need to get medicated,
you need to get,

1505
01:23:39.351 --> 01:23:43.500
and it was just pharmaceuticals and somehow that makes it okay.
Um,

1506
01:23:43.560 --> 01:23:47.520
with a lot of the pharmaceutical drugs been tested on fewer humans than elicit

1507
01:23:47.521 --> 01:23:52.230
drugs.
Hm.
With blessed positive effects.
So I mean,

1508
01:23:52.320 --> 01:23:56.370
like I said,
I don't do either.
I don't do pharmaceutical drugs either.
Um,

1509
01:23:56.410 --> 01:23:59.050
<v 3>well I think what he's trying to do when he's trying to get people on drugs is</v>

1510
01:23:59.051 --> 01:24:01.090
he figures by the time they're calling his show,

1511
01:24:01.240 --> 01:24:05.110
they're like on the edge of suicide and he's trying to prevent them from dying.

1512
01:24:05.111 --> 01:24:08.320
So what he's trying to do is get them happy for a bit and then hopefully they
can

1513
01:24:08.620 --> 01:24:10.560
<v 5>maybe,
but I think a lot of them just sounded,
you know,</v>

1514
01:24:10.600 --> 01:24:13.600
grumpy or wanting to call in and exaggerate their problems in front of everybody

1515
01:24:13.601 --> 01:24:17.560
and then,
you know,
and then his,
his,
his end result is let's,
you know,

1516
01:24:17.590 --> 01:24:20.380
let's keep this person medicated or whatever,
where it's,
you know,

1517
01:24:21.100 --> 01:24:23.720
it's part of the ADHD revolution and the,
you know,

1518
01:24:23.800 --> 01:24:26.710
and medicating creativity out of people and going,

1519
01:24:26.711 --> 01:24:29.620
everything that's different about you.
You know,
instead of exploring it,

1520
01:24:29.800 --> 01:24:32.050
you should hide from it and cover it up.
And I,
you know,

1521
01:24:32.051 --> 01:24:35.590
there's a big movement in that direction.
I'm not a fan and I think it's a,

1522
01:24:36.070 --> 01:24:37.870
it hides behind that to some degree.

1523
01:24:38.190 --> 01:24:39.240
<v 3>Yeah,
I know what you're talking about.</v>

1524
01:24:39.241 --> 01:24:43.260
But I've also had friends that have had some severe depression and were suicidal

1525
01:24:43.470 --> 01:24:46.380
and then got on some stuff like Zoloft or what have you.

1526
01:24:46.710 --> 01:24:50.940
Welbutrin one dude got on and it turned his life around because he all of a

1527
01:24:50.941 --> 01:24:54.570
sudden got happier and he moved his life in a more happy direction and he got

1528
01:24:54.571 --> 01:24:57.390
more positive about what he wanted to do with his life and his relationship.

1529
01:24:57.391 --> 01:25:00.320
I've known people who've got on it and it caught it.
Okay,
understand,
but,

1530
01:25:00.330 --> 01:25:04.360
and then he weaned himself off and now he's a very happy guy and very stable and

1531
01:25:04.361 --> 01:25:07.470
he was stuck in a bad cycle.
And that does happen to some people.

1532
01:25:07.471 --> 01:25:10.690
And I carry be effective in getting you out of a bad cycle.
I totally

1533
01:25:10.730 --> 01:25:11.030
<v 5>great.</v>

1534
01:25:11.030 --> 01:25:13.820
I think there are people who drink their way through a problem too and come out

1535
01:25:13.821 --> 01:25:16.070
the other side,
arguably with the same result.

1536
01:25:16.071 --> 01:25:18.890
But nobody would ever cop to the fact that it was whiskey that got him through.

1537
01:25:19.220 --> 01:25:22.520
But you know,
there's tons of country songs about that.
I think it's about,

1538
01:25:22.521 --> 01:25:24.200
that's about,
it's a depressant,

1539
01:25:24.230 --> 01:25:26.450
but that's the strength of the human spirit I think.

1540
01:25:26.451 --> 01:25:29.420
I think a lot of ways he found his way through it.

1541
01:25:30.170 --> 01:25:33.440
Other people don't take those exact same drugs and it cranks up the suicidal

1542
01:25:33.441 --> 01:25:36.020
reflex that they never had and they ended up killing themselves.

1543
01:25:36.021 --> 01:25:36.854
And I think you know,

1544
01:25:36.870 --> 01:25:39.300
<v 3>well it's definitely touch and go.
I mean you really,</v>

1545
01:25:39.330 --> 01:25:40.770
I mean that's one of the reasons why they go.

1546
01:25:40.890 --> 01:25:44.510
Like I have a friend who's on some stuff right now and he was on some one thing

1547
01:25:44.820 --> 01:25:47.440
work and then they put them on some other stuff.
Italian man,

1548
01:25:47.450 --> 01:25:49.620
he's a lot nicer now that he's on it.
I like them.

1549
01:25:50.170 --> 01:25:52.830
I like them better now that he's on it and he's happier now that he's on it.

1550
01:25:52.840 --> 01:25:54.990
He was,
he had some sort of legitimate issue.
Right.

1551
01:25:55.230 --> 01:25:56.550
There's just some stuff that I have,

1552
01:25:57.180 --> 01:26:00.270
I have problems with and one is that he doesn't exercise and he doesn't eat

1553
01:26:00.271 --> 01:26:03.800
healthy and if he did those things first it probably would take care of a lot of

1554
01:26:03.801 --> 01:26:04.210
it.
I totally

1555
01:26:04.210 --> 01:26:08.000
<v 2>agree,
Dude.
I cannot,
I cannot go without exercise.</v>

1556
01:26:08.260 --> 01:26:12.230
I have real problems.
Yep.
I am not the same person.
I'm a my,

1557
01:26:12.231 --> 01:26:14.150
my trigger is way quicker.

1558
01:26:14.330 --> 01:26:17.750
I get upset about things that are nonsensical and there's no reason for me to

1559
01:26:17.751 --> 01:26:22.100
get even let them into my head and I'll get into a murderous rage about them.

1560
01:26:22.101 --> 01:26:25.320
It's just chimpanzee instincts that need to get out.
You know,

1561
01:26:25.580 --> 01:26:29.570
with this old hardware,
you've got to work this shit because it builds up.
Yup.

1562
01:26:29.600 --> 01:26:32.720
All these hormones and it builds up all this,
you know,
these,

1563
01:26:32.721 --> 01:26:35.760
this fight or flight shit is all inside.
You have to express it to me though,

1564
01:26:35.810 --> 01:26:39.230
our bodies are designed for 30 years of fucking with Willy Mammoth,
you know?

1565
01:26:39.231 --> 01:26:42.170
I mean,
we have to really wrap our heads around that and instead we're sitting at

1566
01:26:42.171 --> 01:26:45.170
laptops and don't fuck you to your ex wife on Facebook,

1567
01:26:45.530 --> 01:26:48.350
which is not a real expression of it.
And it bottles it up even more.

1568
01:26:48.351 --> 01:26:48.801
As a matter of fact,

1569
01:26:48.801 --> 01:26:51.920
you expressed that you create those hormones without the genuine expression of

1570
01:26:51.921 --> 01:26:55.520
how to get them out.
I,
I,
you know,
I do forms every day.
I do,
you know,

1571
01:26:55.580 --> 01:26:58.550
some form of martial arts every single day I do yoga when I get up in the

1572
01:26:58.551 --> 01:27:03.290
morning do really every day.
Yeah.
And I,
and for me it's that same mentality.

1573
01:27:03.291 --> 01:27:04.490
I always say I'm going to do that.

1574
01:27:04.610 --> 01:27:07.790
Then I wound up jerking off and going back to sleep.
Got You.

1575
01:27:07.791 --> 01:27:11.630
Do calm foods or something up and take my yoga class,
I'm going to just beat off,

1576
01:27:11.700 --> 01:27:12.440
take a nap.

1577
01:27:12.440 --> 01:27:16.250
That's another way of unifying your soul with your body and that yoga means

1578
01:27:16.251 --> 01:27:17.690
that's the what the word means.
All My,

1579
01:27:17.990 --> 01:27:20.630
I agree with you that all martial arts are really sort of a,

1580
01:27:20.720 --> 01:27:24.020
it's a like a ice describe.
Taekwondo is a moving meditation,

1581
01:27:24.110 --> 01:27:26.690
so when you're totally into it,
when it's over,

1582
01:27:26.840 --> 01:27:30.500
it's like all the aggression has been drained out of you and you're at peace and

1583
01:27:30.501 --> 01:27:32.600
you're so friendly and happy,
you know,

1584
01:27:32.601 --> 01:27:34.250
and from the tips of your fingers to your toes,

1585
01:27:34.370 --> 01:27:38.180
your brain is connected all those parts evenly as opposed to,
you know,

1586
01:27:38.181 --> 01:27:40.490
like most of us walk around with a dead left arm.

1587
01:27:40.850 --> 01:27:44.000
Most of us walk around with a dead right foot because you're sitting around and

1588
01:27:44.001 --> 01:27:45.950
you're not,
your attention's going to where you need it.

1589
01:27:45.951 --> 01:27:49.490
I use my right hand a lot,
I use,
and if you looked at it objectively,

1590
01:27:49.491 --> 01:27:51.030
if you ever just looked at the arm,

1591
01:27:51.031 --> 01:27:55.820
you don't use that often you'd think it was dead or palsy because your attention

1592
01:27:55.821 --> 01:27:58.370
is so gone.
His arms right now.
See what I mean?

1593
01:27:58.430 --> 01:28:02.060
What's fascinating to me when I get guys that are brand new that come into a

1594
01:28:02.061 --> 01:28:03.050
martial arts class,

1595
01:28:03.260 --> 01:28:06.470
you know when the come to Jujitsu and you see them trying to move their body.

1596
01:28:06.530 --> 01:28:09.680
Yeah.
They've never really had to move their body in any strange way.

1597
01:28:09.830 --> 01:28:13.340
And here they are 30 looking for some new hobby to exercise with.

1598
01:28:13.341 --> 01:28:16.160
So they take a Jujitsu class and they're going through it like they're like

1599
01:28:16.161 --> 01:28:18.140
robots,
man.
It's like they can't do it.

1600
01:28:18.310 --> 01:28:20.540
We signal does not get to their feet the same way.

1601
01:28:20.541 --> 01:28:24.500
And it's so strange and isn't it just as amazing watching them get to the point

1602
01:28:24.501 --> 01:28:28.610
where they can,
it doesn't take as long as you think,
but it is.
It's you're like,

1603
01:28:28.640 --> 01:28:32.180
oh,
your brain is now attached to that part of your body.
In a way.
It never was.

1604
01:28:32.181 --> 01:28:35.420
Every like half of you was on autopilot for most of your life.

1605
01:28:35.480 --> 01:28:37.490
I've seen dudes go from being this,

1606
01:28:37.491 --> 01:28:40.010
one of the beautiful things about Jujitsu is that a lot of the people that

1607
01:28:40.011 --> 01:28:41.960
practice Jujitsu are very smart.

1608
01:28:42.150 --> 01:28:44.870
People think of Jujitsu and they think of wrestling and think of like really

1609
01:28:44.871 --> 01:28:47.600
strong burly meathead type men.

1610
01:28:47.690 --> 01:28:51.740
But most of the guys who do Jujitsu are like,
they're like computer nerds.

1611
01:28:51.950 --> 01:28:55.700
They like really smart people who figured out what a crazy thing this is,

1612
01:28:55.880 --> 01:29:00.450
that it's all really about leverage and position and technique.
Jews.
Yeah.

1613
01:29:00.451 --> 01:29:04.170
It's like you understand Mary Abrasion of the human body and the human body's

1614
01:29:04.171 --> 01:29:05.130
moving in a certain direction.

1615
01:29:05.131 --> 01:29:07.350
You counter that movement and ply your own pressure.

1616
01:29:07.351 --> 01:29:09.870
And I mean it's really like the,
the,
the,

1617
01:29:09.871 --> 01:29:14.430
it's really like this incredibly complex game of how to,
you know,

1618
01:29:14.431 --> 01:29:17.310
submit a body.
Yep.
You know,
how to stop a body.
Right.
You know,

1619
01:29:17.311 --> 01:29:20.910
and people don't understand how much intelligence is behind something like that.

1620
01:29:21.150 --> 01:29:21.983
You know,

1621
01:29:22.000 --> 01:29:26.190
everyone would benefit every single person out there would benefit from some

1622
01:29:26.191 --> 01:29:28.260
sort of a Marshall.
I agree.
I agree.
I think at first of all,

1623
01:29:28.261 --> 01:29:31.470
I think tattoos should be taught in schools like either Yang style or something

1624
01:29:31.471 --> 01:29:35.660
as it's a way of centering yourself before classes began.
I'm a big fan of,
uh,

1625
01:29:35.910 --> 01:29:39.270
do that in business and in schools because your brain,
your body,

1626
01:29:39.271 --> 01:29:43.260
you're not fidgeting separately if they're in line to,
what do they do in school?

1627
01:29:43.261 --> 01:29:46.920
Do they like have a Tai Chi half hour or something to kind of do like a morning

1628
01:29:47.010 --> 01:29:48.300
calisthenics thing,

1629
01:29:48.330 --> 01:29:53.040
but it's largely Tai Chi movements that would be such a good move for schools if

1630
01:29:53.041 --> 01:29:57.150
schools had some happy moment where everybody met in like an auditorium and

1631
01:29:57.151 --> 01:29:57.241
there,

1632
01:29:57.241 --> 01:30:00.870
the first thing everybody did yet was say there were thankful to be there and

1633
01:30:00.871 --> 01:30:03.600
then go through some [inaudible] thing.
You know,

1634
01:30:03.660 --> 01:30:07.080
that's basically what they do in China,
which is why they're eating our lunch.
Um,

1635
01:30:07.110 --> 01:30:09.840
but also because they're willing to work for rice.
Okay.

1636
01:30:09.841 --> 01:30:13.590
They're willing to work and live in fucking dorms.
Yeah.
That was that place.

1637
01:30:13.600 --> 01:30:16.980
They've,
everyone's jumping off the roof,
Brian.
Oh yeah,
John.
Yeah.
Foxconn.

1638
01:30:17.190 --> 01:30:17.761
Apparently though,

1639
01:30:17.761 --> 01:30:21.270
the percentage of people that commit suicide in that place is a smaller,

1640
01:30:21.271 --> 01:30:24.420
relatively to the percentage of people that commit suicide overall.

1641
01:30:24.520 --> 01:30:28.770
It's just that this corporation is so huge.
It's got a half a million workers.

1642
01:30:28.800 --> 01:30:32.150
Yeah,
right.
It's got around that right.
Wrap your head around a half an hour.

1643
01:30:32.160 --> 01:30:32.671
You showing up.

1644
01:30:32.671 --> 01:30:37.500
How do you govern 1.2 billion people in one place.

1645
01:30:37.530 --> 01:30:40.890
God Damn,
you have Gulf heard off the Internet.
That's what you have to do.
Right.

1646
01:30:40.891 --> 01:30:41.191
Cut Off.

1647
01:30:41.191 --> 01:30:44.000
Then you start to write and then you started looking at their decisions going,
I,

1648
01:30:44.040 --> 01:30:46.510
I'm kind of with you.
Cut off the Internet and,
and,

1649
01:30:46.511 --> 01:30:49.500
and make them scared of fire gods.
You know,
you've got to,

1650
01:30:49.520 --> 01:30:51.990
nobody's scared of fire gets fucking aliens.
They're flying,

1651
01:30:52.050 --> 01:30:52.800
they're flying around the,

1652
01:30:52.800 --> 01:30:57.360
and I spent a decent amount of time in China and in Taiwan because I speak

1653
01:30:57.361 --> 01:30:59.370
Chinese.
And so I,
I just learned Chinese,

1654
01:30:59.640 --> 01:31:04.140
my Kung Fu instructors from Beijing and he's older,
so I,
out of respect for him,

1655
01:31:04.141 --> 01:31:08.370
I started learning a little bit of you.
So I sweet.
Yeah.
Kind of Chinese Mandarin.

1656
01:31:08.460 --> 01:31:12.660
Do you write it or do I,
yeah,
a decent amount.
I mean,
I'm like a six year old kid.

1657
01:31:12.661 --> 01:31:16.760
I can talk really well and really cool.
And Chinese like say,
um,

1658
01:31:16.980 --> 01:31:21.300
you are listening to the Joe Rogan experience with Joe Rogan and Brian Red Band.

1659
01:31:21.380 --> 01:31:22.700
And you say that in Chinese?
Yeah.
Nations.

1660
01:31:22.710 --> 01:31:26.580
I ting to the Joe Rogan experience a gun,
uh,

1661
01:31:26.610 --> 01:31:31.320
I guess with Joe Rogan Gun.
Brian.
Yeah.
Wow.
Yeah.

1662
01:31:31.800 --> 01:31:35.190
I mean it's,
if you have a new commercial Brian.
Yeah,
totally.
Yeah,

1663
01:31:35.250 --> 01:31:39.870
I'm looking forward to it.
How long did it take time in Chinese on the bat?
Um,
I,

1664
01:31:39.871 --> 01:31:43.710
uh,
well,
I mean I'm constantly evolving and learning more,

1665
01:31:43.711 --> 01:31:46.620
but about two years before I was able to hold down a conversation.

1666
01:31:46.621 --> 01:31:50.580
Should go Rosetta stone or did you take classes?
Books and cds mostly.

1667
01:31:50.610 --> 01:31:54.450
And then as Rosetta stone work,
it's great.
The new,
the new one is awesome.

1668
01:31:54.720 --> 01:31:56.970
I bought Rosetta stone when I first started learning.

1669
01:31:57.010 --> 01:32:00.040
It was the original like American system.
That's

1670
01:32:00.040 --> 01:32:04.750
<v 5>where Rosetta stone comes from.
It's the old governmental ambassadorship program.</v>

1671
01:32:04.751 --> 01:32:07.520
They started developing,
what do you mean?
That's where it comes from.
That's,

1672
01:32:07.590 --> 01:32:09.230
that's the,
the,
the origins of the program.

1673
01:32:09.231 --> 01:32:11.920
That's kind of like a department of defense kind of thing where we get

1674
01:32:11.921 --> 01:32:12.850
technology from there.

1675
01:32:12.851 --> 01:32:16.610
They just figured out the best way to teach a land quickly to ambassadorships

1676
01:32:16.611 --> 01:32:19.060
and to,
and for businessmen.
And it was all aimed at that.

1677
01:32:19.061 --> 01:32:21.760
And so all like every early Chinese book like,

1678
01:32:21.761 --> 01:32:24.370
and I was starting to learn Chinese a little late nineties,

1679
01:32:24.640 --> 01:32:28.570
all of them where I work for the American Silk Company,

1680
01:32:28.660 --> 01:32:32.560
I am trying to buy this.
Where is the restaurant?
Um,

1681
01:32:32.590 --> 01:32:36.550
what time do you get off work?
Um,
would you like to come back to my hotel room?

1682
01:32:37.270 --> 01:32:41.740
All of it is trying to fuck the locals are fuck the locals.
Wow.
That's funny.

1683
01:32:42.340 --> 01:32:43.150
It's true.

1684
01:32:43.150 --> 01:32:46.510
And now it's much better now it's moved down and people are learning because

1685
01:32:46.511 --> 01:32:47.344
they want to learn.

1686
01:32:47.830 --> 01:32:51.160
And most people think Chinese is hard because they have to learn it for
business.

1687
01:32:51.161 --> 01:32:53.710
I'm getting transferred over there,
so fuck this is awful.

1688
01:32:53.830 --> 01:32:57.430
But if you love anything,
it comes that much quicker.
So yeah.

1689
01:32:57.490 --> 01:33:02.260
So for you is just fascinating.
Yeah.
Did you ever do standup in Chinese?
Um,
I,
oh,

1690
01:33:02.270 --> 01:33:06.180
I can.
I'm doing the goal is I'm working on doing a special there.
Holy Shit.

1691
01:33:06.181 --> 01:33:09.700
Later this year,
later in August,
first of all,

1692
01:33:09.701 --> 01:33:13.830
they're going to kill you and shoot you over.
You would tank.
No,

1693
01:33:13.850 --> 01:33:16.750
that's what I hear.
They liked me,
but I hear the government probably would,

1694
01:33:16.820 --> 01:33:17.591
you know?
No,

1695
01:33:17.591 --> 01:33:20.440
I mean I don't get to not talking about some controversial shit I guess.

1696
01:33:20.441 --> 01:33:23.050
I mean I try and eat,
stand up.
You've got to keep it clean,
son.
You'd be sure.

1697
01:33:23.140 --> 01:33:25.270
It's interesting if you've been there.
Have you been to China?
No.

1698
01:33:25.271 --> 01:33:28.750
Never been to China.
I've never been to any Asian country.
I really,
no.
Wow.

1699
01:33:28.960 --> 01:33:29.860
I know I need to,
I want to,

1700
01:33:29.861 --> 01:33:33.700
I want to go to Tokyo this year for the k one Grand Prix,

1701
01:33:33.820 --> 01:33:35.320
but I had been traveling too much.

1702
01:33:35.490 --> 01:33:40.490
It go to Taiwan to gray's work in Taiwan is like the Amsterdam of China in the,

1703
01:33:41.820 --> 01:33:46.750
you know,
like,
uh,
they're very open society.
It's very Chinese in culturally,

1704
01:33:46.960 --> 01:33:51.280
but there,
uh,
but there are demo,
they're democracy and like,
um,

1705
01:33:51.490 --> 01:33:53.880
their rules or as loose as are are,

1706
01:33:53.980 --> 01:33:58.240
they're actually more open than the United States really.
Um,
but it's,
uh,
it's,

1707
01:33:58.241 --> 01:34:02.320
and they're technologically super advanced there.
Uh,
you know,
Taiwan,
yeah.

1708
01:34:02.321 --> 01:34:05.170
They've bullet trains and Wifi had cities and shit like that.

1709
01:34:05.180 --> 01:34:09.520
[inaudible] has a lot.
They play pool.
I have a,
an addiction to pool do again.

1710
01:34:09.540 --> 01:34:14.140
Yeah.
Bad.
And uh,
in Taiwan pool is huge.
It's like,
you know,
the national sport.

1711
01:34:14.200 --> 01:34:18.430
Yeah,
I guess so.
I mean,
they pay people to play for the,
the Taiwanese now.

1712
01:34:18.790 --> 01:34:22.450
It's a beautiful place.
I've been in a bunch of times and I'm a huge fan.
Um,

1713
01:34:22.630 --> 01:34:25.930
but that it's a good precursor to going into China.
When you go there,

1714
01:34:26.080 --> 01:34:30.550
people aren't as under the veil as they act and that the communist regime in

1715
01:34:30.551 --> 01:34:35.260
China is holding on like white knuckle to this bull of a,

1716
01:34:35.680 --> 01:34:38.950
of will of just freedom,
freedom of all sorts.

1717
01:34:38.951 --> 01:34:41.950
Like they can't wrap their head around and all they're doing and they're doing

1718
01:34:41.951 --> 01:34:46.951
it pretty well is just trying to keep everybody from fracturing and exploding.

1719
01:34:47.261 --> 01:34:50.050
That's the whole locking people up.
Blocking dissidence up.
Yeah.

1720
01:34:50.051 --> 01:34:53.950
But a lot of the dissidents they do like in the fall and Daca and that kind of

1721
01:34:53.951 --> 01:34:58.240
stuff there,
um,
half of us here would go,
I kind of shoot,
we'll,

1722
01:34:58.460 --> 01:35:01.850
I should go 0.1,
the Guy Douchey so we'll suck it up.
Do she goes,

1723
01:35:02.030 --> 01:35:05.330
sometimes they're,
you know,
hear about the guy and I ran their,

1724
01:35:05.510 --> 01:35:08.780
their dissident is our Unabomber to some degree.

1725
01:35:08.990 --> 01:35:11.930
Some guy writes a bunch of papers and blow some places up and we lock them up

1726
01:35:11.931 --> 01:35:13.220
and you know,
that kind of idea.

1727
01:35:13.280 --> 01:35:17.000
Like we don't know the connection to their society and I'm not saying they're

1728
01:35:17.001 --> 01:35:20.170
not,
I'm not letting him off the hook at all.
They totally do act in a,

1729
01:35:20.290 --> 01:35:24.860
in a horribly authoritative way,
but you get it once you spend time over there,

1730
01:35:24.920 --> 01:35:28.280
why and then the,
you know,
and you've got what you get.
You get that.

1731
01:35:28.281 --> 01:35:30.020
They just have to because there's too many political yeah.

1732
01:35:30.021 --> 01:35:32.240
On occasion they're just,
cause you get to a certain amount of people,

1733
01:35:32.241 --> 01:35:34.610
you can't really govern them and he'd know exactly.
That's what I mean.

1734
01:35:34.611 --> 01:35:37.850
When there's 1.2 billion people in your country,
you kind of get it.

1735
01:35:37.850 --> 01:35:41.450
I'm not actually supposed to be like 50,000 that the map,
but you can only,

1736
01:35:41.540 --> 01:35:45.620
I think you can only maintain 14,000 in your consciousness of human beings over

1737
01:35:45.621 --> 01:35:49.580
the course of your lifetime.
14th that,
well,
I know you can only keep 150 names.

1738
01:35:49.610 --> 01:35:52.850
Yeah.
There's a thing called Dunbar's number's right.
And 50 yeah.

1739
01:35:52.910 --> 01:35:55.430
All those are people who have a higher number than others.

1740
01:35:55.431 --> 01:35:59.150
That's an average of hard drives.
Pro.
We have bullshit iPhone ones.

1741
01:35:59.180 --> 01:36:01.430
Some people have bigger,
you know,
bigger and better ones.

1742
01:36:01.431 --> 01:36:04.580
And interestingly enough,
and you deal with this.
Yes.
We're going to say,
oh,

1743
01:36:04.581 --> 01:36:07.760
I was just gonna say like speak and spell or web.
Simon says,

1744
01:36:07.761 --> 01:36:08.660
remember what assignment,

1745
01:36:08.990 --> 01:36:12.500
if you do it like you have this one number and every time it hits that number it

1746
01:36:12.501 --> 01:36:15.000
just turns off for me at least and letting it go past it.

1747
01:36:15.020 --> 01:36:19.100
You can't go back to that capacity.
Interestingly enough,
like people,

1748
01:36:19.190 --> 01:36:20.670
I think it was Jack Nicholson who said,
uh,

1749
01:36:20.750 --> 01:36:23.630
he was reading on statistics and you're saying that um,

1750
01:36:23.690 --> 01:36:28.490
the average human being in modern society in Western society meets over the

1751
01:36:28.491 --> 01:36:29.660
course of their whole life,

1752
01:36:29.720 --> 01:36:34.310
9,000 people from deep connections to how are you,
oh,
hi,
I'm Tim.

1753
01:36:34.340 --> 01:36:38.660
And have conversation to waving at a bus guy.
9,000 people your whole life.

1754
01:36:39.500 --> 01:36:43.670
The average,
even moderate society TV like social,
a celebrity,

1755
01:36:44.060 --> 01:36:47.930
like a TV weather man can meet up to 16,000 people a year.

1756
01:36:48.860 --> 01:36:51.290
If you're a national celebrity of any level,

1757
01:36:51.380 --> 01:36:56.300
you can meet 36,000 people a year and half of those people you actually connect

1758
01:36:56.301 --> 01:37:01.010
with.
You spend legit time with them and you know this,
you stand at after a show.

1759
01:37:01.011 --> 01:37:03.500
If you do meet and greets or if you meet fans beforehand or whatever,

1760
01:37:03.680 --> 01:37:07.430
you're having more of a conversation with them sometimes in that 30 seconds to

1761
01:37:07.431 --> 01:37:12.170
two minutes.
Then they've had with anybody in their circle in a while.

1762
01:37:12.800 --> 01:37:13.461
Right.
You know,

1763
01:37:13.461 --> 01:37:15.980
it's like that guy in Jujitsu class who hasn't used his feet in a long time.

1764
01:37:15.981 --> 01:37:18.620
They haven't used their conversational skills with a stranger.
Right.

1765
01:37:19.040 --> 01:37:23.330
And express themselves in any deep way to somebody that they're impressed by in

1766
01:37:23.390 --> 01:37:24.223
ever.

1767
01:37:24.230 --> 01:37:27.440
And so you actually have a deeper connection with and spend more time with and

1768
01:37:27.441 --> 01:37:31.850
are connected to more human beings than anybody in the history of the planet has

1769
01:37:31.851 --> 01:37:34.700
ever had.
Like from my end priests to Pharaoh's,

1770
01:37:34.850 --> 01:37:39.850
they never came in contact with as many people and had direct contact with them.

1771
01:37:40.640 --> 01:37:44.660
You're freaking me out than just an average than than than you do.
Yeah.

1772
01:37:44.661 --> 01:37:47.780
I've always wondered that because I've run into so many people that I can't

1773
01:37:47.781 --> 01:37:51.680
remember.
So unfortunate,
so frustrating.
And it's not that I,

1774
01:37:51.681 --> 01:37:55.760
I want and not impersonal like,
man,
I'm just more important.
You broke.
Remember,

1775
01:37:55.790 --> 01:37:56.160
it's like

1776
01:37:56.160 --> 01:38:00.240
<v 2>I don't have the room.
There's no room in my brain.
I don't have any room.
Yeah.</v>

1777
01:38:00.570 --> 01:38:03.840
And I can't maintain where you are at all times.
Like a tracking device in my,

1778
01:38:04.070 --> 01:38:06.840
in my,
and eventually you'll come back if you hang out for a second,

1779
01:38:07.260 --> 01:38:09.700
you'll come back.
We'll be there.
Yeah.
And,

1780
01:38:09.820 --> 01:38:11.610
and is it your name that's important or that we connect?

1781
01:38:11.880 --> 01:38:14.220
You can get a lot of people is their name.
You don't even know my name,
Bro.

1782
01:38:14.340 --> 01:38:17.160
You don't even know her name.
Eddie Bravo gotten a thing with this dude recently.

1783
01:38:17.161 --> 01:38:21.840
Yeah.
With a guy who's a MMA guy that he's been around forever and he just didn't

1784
01:38:21.841 --> 01:38:23.430
remember the dude's name.
And the guy was like,

1785
01:38:23.431 --> 01:38:26.940
you don't even know my fucking name,
Bro.
He's like,
dude,
I know you.
I know you.

1786
01:38:26.941 --> 01:38:30.480
I know you.
Right.
Okay.
You know what I mean?
People I meet,
I don't know your name.

1787
01:38:30.481 --> 01:38:33.570
Right,
but I know you.
Is that okay?
Is from the minute we met,

1788
01:38:33.630 --> 01:38:37.290
I never knew your name.
Your name never came up.
You'd never came up and said,
hey,

1789
01:38:37.291 --> 01:38:40.050
my name is Brian.
Know this dude.
He did know his name.
Oh yes.

1790
01:38:40.051 --> 01:38:43.980
I forgot to the people it was,
a lot of people do that though.
They'll,

1791
01:38:44.010 --> 01:38:47.010
they'll kind of,
they'll know your name because they know your name.
Right.

1792
01:38:47.100 --> 01:38:50.640
So like part of their brain says,
oh,
I don't have to introduce myself.

1793
01:38:50.790 --> 01:38:55.460
We know each other.
It's not something you're used to experiencing.
Right,

1794
01:38:55.550 --> 01:38:57.990
right,
right.
Yeah.
Meeting,
meeting people after shows.

1795
01:38:57.991 --> 01:39:00.990
Is it different from music than it is for comedy?
Totally.
Yeah.

1796
01:39:00.991 --> 01:39:04.190
What's the difference?
Um,
let's see.
Oh,
what'd you,

1797
01:39:05.760 --> 01:39:10.230
yes.
There's a different girls like singers and comedians.
That's not true.

1798
01:39:10.290 --> 01:39:13.110
More girls want to date comedians.
They want to fuck singers,

1799
01:39:13.111 --> 01:39:16.440
but they like them both the same.
We serve a different purpose.

1800
01:39:18.360 --> 01:39:21.620
Girls after comedy shows want to be your boyfriend,
Brian.

1801
01:39:21.660 --> 01:39:24.000
Girls after girls right in the material as we speak.

1802
01:39:24.080 --> 01:39:27.420
I want to blow you in a broom closet and really trying to blow you in a broom

1803
01:39:27.421 --> 01:39:29.350
closet.
I have to rock shows.
It's selected.

1804
01:39:29.370 --> 01:39:32.950
Do slutty shit after rock shows cause it's,
it's a different expression.
You,
you,

1805
01:39:33.180 --> 01:39:35.150
it's a different vibe that's coming just to,

1806
01:39:35.190 --> 01:39:39.240
you were so special up there alone with that spotlight on you that she wants

1807
01:39:39.241 --> 01:39:42.030
that special thing in our mouth.
That dirty bitch.

1808
01:39:42.210 --> 01:39:45.180
She wants to be special and make her decide if she wants a good thing.
Johnny,

1809
01:39:45.240 --> 01:39:47.250
which is a good thing.
I know buddy man.
That's what I mean.

1810
01:39:47.280 --> 01:39:49.560
Like it's girls liking when you call them dirty bitches.

1811
01:39:49.561 --> 01:39:52.680
I'm usually meeting with love as long as you're like,
I don't roll that way.

1812
01:39:52.710 --> 01:39:56.670
You dirty bitch.
I,
yeah.
Really?
You're hanging out with Ron chicks,
man.
Trust me.

1813
01:39:56.910 --> 01:40:00.480
The ones who can appreciate a good you dirty bitch.
Those are the fun ones.

1814
01:40:00.510 --> 01:40:04.050
As long as it's not with negative,
it's all no hate in your heart,
right Brian?

1815
01:40:04.080 --> 01:40:08.580
Yes.
See I,
yeah.
How's the talking dirty coming along?
Oh,
you're working on that.

1816
01:40:08.900 --> 01:40:12.630
Been working on that lately?
How's that coming along?
Yeah.
You know,

1817
01:40:12.631 --> 01:40:16.210
I've just been louder with the grunts and sounds,
but I'm going to start.
It's uh,

1818
01:40:16.320 --> 01:40:20.490
yeah.
Did you at least put a little bass in it cause you asked,

1819
01:40:20.491 --> 01:40:24.200
grabbing the back of that,
it was kind of,
Hey,
what are you in?

1820
01:40:24.270 --> 01:40:28.140
Japanese Manga character.
Hey,

1821
01:40:30.780 --> 01:40:31.710
what's your come noise?

1822
01:40:34.950 --> 01:40:37.380
Is there a drop off or is there an anger at the end of it?
I,

1823
01:40:37.490 --> 01:40:41.320
well lately I've been modifying it,
so I'll let let you hate it here.

1824
01:40:41.340 --> 01:40:46.140
We'll be done with it.
I'm nice.
I do Ted.
That's not true.

1825
01:40:46.320 --> 01:40:50.600
I whispered
earliest the cracking though.

1826
01:40:50.610 --> 01:40:53.830
What's the best thing you've ever said while you're busted or not lose your

1827
01:40:53.831 --> 01:40:54.400
fucking

1828
01:40:54.400 --> 01:40:59.140
<v 3>mistake.
What the Fuck's wrong?
Take it back.</v>

1829
01:40:59.300 --> 01:41:02.280
Shit.
Shit.
Shacks.

1830
01:41:02.860 --> 01:41:04.570
Especially when car side them.

1831
01:41:06.140 --> 01:41:08.710
That's why it's such an amazing difference.

1832
01:41:08.800 --> 01:41:13.800
The complete different level of consciousness between right before you come and

1833
01:41:14.291 --> 01:41:16.270
right after you come,
right before you come,

1834
01:41:16.300 --> 01:41:19.240
you're looking at life through a goddamn toilet paper roll.
Yeah.

1835
01:41:19.330 --> 01:41:21.010
Like you see almost nothing.

1836
01:41:21.011 --> 01:41:24.730
You have the most massive blinders on and then boom,

1837
01:41:25.060 --> 01:41:26.680
that's gone right after you come.

1838
01:41:26.681 --> 01:41:30.910
And then you're dealing with her breath and her personality and where am I and

1839
01:41:30.911 --> 01:41:35.911
what am I doing and how drunk did I get an oh fuck and this is so stupid.

1840
01:41:36.641 --> 01:41:41.020
Why is she crying?
Why am I crying?
Really blood is this,

1841
01:41:41.021 --> 01:41:44.200
why am I wearing this lipstick?
This is your way of,
these shoes don't fit.

1842
01:41:44.410 --> 01:41:49.150
Where's my car?
Right.
Yeah.
See it.
Listen,
man,
if you haven't experienced,

1843
01:41:49.151 --> 01:41:52.180
don't knock it,
bro.
These are learning experiences.

1844
01:41:52.750 --> 01:41:56.740
If you've never had terrible fucking disastrous sexual mishaps in your,

1845
01:41:56.741 --> 01:41:59.730
in your life,
of course,
but not alcohol and do this,

1846
01:41:59.731 --> 01:42:01.840
do you ever hit the same level?
No.
I began to go,

1847
01:42:01.850 --> 01:42:05.590
I've been completely responsible for it will.
Completely responsible.
No excuses.

1848
01:42:05.591 --> 01:42:09.640
You remember it?
Yeah.
Yeah.
That's the problem.
And alcohol is the worst drug,

1849
01:42:10.060 --> 01:42:13.810
alcohol and sex together to just like Jesus Christ.
What?

1850
01:42:14.230 --> 01:42:16.000
I love alcohol and sex together.
I don't know,

1851
01:42:16.001 --> 01:42:20.710
but I'm saying it's like it's not that great.
We know person and yeah,
you know,

1852
01:42:20.711 --> 01:42:25.150
but what I'm saying is the idea of the pursuit of alcohol going out and getting

1853
01:42:25.151 --> 01:42:28.490
drunk and the pursuit of sex the same time getting to know people.
And you know,

1854
01:42:28.900 --> 01:42:30.820
you don't know anybody when you're drunk.
You don't know them.

1855
01:42:30.821 --> 01:42:33.670
They don't know you.
Who the fuck is anybody with that pose or get in there,

1856
01:42:33.700 --> 01:42:37.690
right?
And then what I'd done,

1857
01:42:38.470 --> 01:42:41.710
and that's the amazing thing is it's that you can make a person that way.

1858
01:42:41.920 --> 01:42:44.860
There's a reason why your Dick is supposed to be soft when you're drunk,

1859
01:42:44.890 --> 01:42:46.240
when you can't get it up because you're drunk.

1860
01:42:46.510 --> 01:42:49.420
It's because every fee that doesn't work under that in their body that that,

1861
01:42:49.421 --> 01:42:52.120
that that law does not work on me when I'm drunk.

1862
01:42:52.121 --> 01:42:55.320
I am harder than I've ever been in my life.
It's like opposite for them.

1863
01:42:55.450 --> 01:42:59.110
Everyone Times somebody says,
I'm like,
what?
That's not a real thing.
You know why?

1864
01:42:59.290 --> 01:43:03.640
Because you have retard jeans and your,
you're retarded jeans.
They want to be,

1865
01:43:03.820 --> 01:43:08.590
you want to propagate the worst situation possible.
Like how drunk is he?

1866
01:43:08.591 --> 01:43:13.390
He's really drunk.
How big of a mistake is he making a really big mistake.

1867
01:43:13.391 --> 01:43:13.930
Okay.

1868
01:43:13.930 --> 01:43:18.930
I want every sperm in that we're going in and you look at her.

1869
01:43:19.690 --> 01:43:24.250
This kid will be dumb and ugly.
Yeah,
she stinks.
Her feet.

1870
01:43:24.260 --> 01:43:28.700
That's fucking hilarious.
You're in an alley.
This should even be happened.

1871
01:43:28.780 --> 01:43:31.040
Let him think he's got the condom on,
but I'm thinking put it on

1872
01:43:35.470 --> 01:43:40.270
person.
Blump
take care of me.
Teach me everything.

1873
01:43:40.880 --> 01:43:44.320
You're here to make robots.
You're here to make garbage men

1874
01:43:45.880 --> 01:43:50.460
to you're here for.
That's hilarious.
Wheat.
That's probably right.
Probably real.

1875
01:43:52.160 --> 01:43:53.730
That's the spirit.
That's right.

1876
01:43:54.260 --> 01:43:57.950
My Body does not want me producing loads when I'm drunk.
When I'm,
if I'm drunk,

1877
01:43:57.951 --> 01:43:59.990
I just,
it's my deck does not want to work.

1878
01:44:00.380 --> 01:44:04.730
Does now want and I listened to you chose who you choose as your Dick knows,

1879
01:44:04.731 --> 01:44:07.640
you're not thinking straight.
Right.
That's what I mean.
What are you doing?
Stupid.

1880
01:44:07.641 --> 01:44:11.600
Where are you don't even know where you are.
No alcohol.

1881
01:44:11.601 --> 01:44:16.350
Especially when you're like 20 2021 like you have one of these like in a,

1882
01:44:16.351 --> 01:44:20.240
in a glass case break.
Yeah.
Well,
I always have drunk break glass.

1883
01:44:20.241 --> 01:44:21.031
I always tell people,

1884
01:44:21.031 --> 01:44:23.780
and we used to talk about this amongst my friends when I was a kid,

1885
01:44:23.900 --> 01:44:26.060
we used to give each other advice,
like always say,

1886
01:44:26.210 --> 01:44:27.470
you know you're going out tonight,

1887
01:44:27.560 --> 01:44:30.560
you got to jerk off before you leave the house.
Always.
So we'd have that rule.

1888
01:44:30.561 --> 01:44:33.170
Me and my friend showed did Telia we'd always talk about it.
Did you,

1889
01:44:33.200 --> 01:44:34.940
did you jerk off?
What are you doing going out?

1890
01:44:34.970 --> 01:44:37.790
Don't go out unless you Jurgen off.
I learned that from something about Mary.

1891
01:44:38.030 --> 01:44:41.360
Right.
That role.
Do they have that in of America?
Really?
What'd they say?

1892
01:44:41.500 --> 01:44:44.760
Say he doesn't,
that's why.
That's where that comes from.
Oh,
that's,

1893
01:44:44.810 --> 01:44:48.080
oh that's right.
He didn't know where to come went and she was a great thanks.

1894
01:44:48.081 --> 01:44:50.840
It's hair goo on.
It was a great movie.
Yeah.
Yeah,

1895
01:44:50.841 --> 01:44:54.620
that it's such an important thing and some guys will talk about it and it's a

1896
01:44:54.621 --> 01:44:57.350
big thing.
When you growing up,
what kind of friends do you have?

1897
01:44:57.351 --> 01:44:59.750
Do you have the kind of friends that you could talk about jerking off in front

1898
01:44:59.751 --> 01:45:02.480
of or do you not have the kind of friends you can talk about jerking off in

1899
01:45:02.481 --> 01:45:05.180
front of?
It's very important that you find the right friends,
right?

1900
01:45:05.210 --> 01:45:08.420
Because you can have this weird annoying life where you don't really discuss

1901
01:45:08.421 --> 01:45:12.290
important,
weird,
you know,
embarrassing shit with each other.

1902
01:45:12.500 --> 01:45:16.010
Or you can have the friend that calls you up,
dude,
I just shit my pants again.

1903
01:45:16.410 --> 01:45:18.710
I can't have a believes would've fought my card.
I Shit my pants.

1904
01:45:18.860 --> 01:45:22.160
If you're around with friends that don't always have to be the hero,

1905
01:45:22.290 --> 01:45:24.560
not always the coolest guy in the room.
They know.

1906
01:45:24.561 --> 01:45:28.160
I told him to fuck off and then he fucking loved and I know the Troy Pussy,

1907
01:45:28.460 --> 01:45:31.490
you know,
if you have the friends that you know,

1908
01:45:31.491 --> 01:45:34.430
we'll talk about the embarrassing shit and be honest and real with you,

1909
01:45:34.640 --> 01:45:35.870
then you're going to have a fun life.

1910
01:45:36.140 --> 01:45:40.470
Then you're going to have a good time laughing till you're crying like a table.

1911
01:45:41.350 --> 01:45:43.520
Like I can't fucking right dude.

1912
01:45:43.521 --> 01:45:46.970
Some of my funnest moments ever have been talking to a friend after he did

1913
01:45:46.971 --> 01:45:51.440
something stupid as fuck and they're calling you up.
I'm an idiot.
Oh my God,

1914
01:45:51.441 --> 01:45:52.274
I'm dumb.

1915
01:45:52.310 --> 01:45:55.150
And the good part is you have friends who are saying the exact same thing.
Yeah.

1916
01:45:55.850 --> 01:46:00.040
Well,
you know that's,
it's a big part of life,
man.
You got,

1917
01:46:00.050 --> 01:46:04.160
if there's no sense in like there was a story about this kid that went to Iraq,

1918
01:46:04.580 --> 01:46:08.930
comes back,
looks for a hooker,
picks up a hooker.
Santa Monica Boulevard,

1919
01:46:09.050 --> 01:46:13.880
gets a bulge from a hooker,
finds out the hookers.
A dude kills him.
Okay?

1920
01:46:14.090 --> 01:46:18.950
Dumps the body out of his car.
The cops see him,
dump the body,
high speed,

1921
01:46:18.951 --> 01:46:23.420
chase into the desert,
jumps out of his car with a gun suicide by cop.

1922
01:46:23.421 --> 01:46:24.710
They kill them.
Plow.
And I'm like,

1923
01:46:24.980 --> 01:46:28.870
all because this dude didn't want to admit that a dude blew him.

1924
01:46:29.240 --> 01:46:32.940
He would have had one of the best stories ever,
right?

1925
01:46:32.960 --> 01:46:34.910
If you're at parties in your dragon,
Mike,

1926
01:46:34.940 --> 01:46:39.260
tell us about that fucking dude who blew you.
Okay,
give me another beer.
Totally.

1927
01:46:39.410 --> 01:46:43.730
Everybody sit down.
All right,
this is how horny I was.
Totally.
And you know,

1928
01:46:43.731 --> 01:46:47.090
it'd be halfway to the story.
I was Kinda like,
God,
is this a dude?
Right?
Yeah.

1929
01:46:47.120 --> 01:46:50.340
Fuck,
I don't kick.
Should I come like hi.
Shouldn't

1930
01:46:50.340 --> 01:46:54.930
<v 5>come too late.
Fuck right.
And then I realized it was,
you know,
I mean,
come on man,</v>

1931
01:46:54.931 --> 01:46:58.170
that'd be a fantastic story,
dude.
There they PR.
Here's the thing.

1932
01:46:58.260 --> 01:47:02.850
That guy died over something that when you go to boot Phuket,
Thailand,

1933
01:47:02.940 --> 01:47:06.970
and then they print tee shirts that have,
uh,

1934
01:47:06.980 --> 01:47:11.280
a soldier I'm making out with a chick on and,

1935
01:47:11.340 --> 01:47:12.560
and uh,
oh,

1936
01:47:12.600 --> 01:47:17.310
he's looking down and she's looking down and over his head there's an Arab,
uh,

1937
01:47:17.370 --> 01:47:21.750
like a thought bubble that says,
oh,
and he's got a huge Boehner and soda.
She,

1938
01:47:22.110 --> 01:47:26.640
and that's the joke.
It's so consistent.
They print tee shirts about it.

1939
01:47:26.760 --> 01:47:29.610
And what happens in Thailand to do just get drunk and say,
fuck it all up.

1940
01:47:29.611 --> 01:47:31.800
This kid me.
Yeah,
the kid toys there,

1941
01:47:31.801 --> 01:47:36.801
which you're the lady boys who look so much like women that don't see it coming,

1942
01:47:38.130 --> 01:47:41.910
no pun intended,
that,
uh,
they,
that it just becomes a,

1943
01:47:41.920 --> 01:47:45.840
these guys get drunk and then they just pounce on you because the real women

1944
01:47:45.841 --> 01:47:49.290
work in the,
in the bars and guys go in and you go,

1945
01:47:49.291 --> 01:47:52.290
I want number 52 and you pay to take her out of the bar and you take her

1946
01:47:52.291 --> 01:47:54.210
someplace in fucker.
Damn.
Say how many,

1947
01:47:54.240 --> 01:47:58.560
what percentage of women and prostitutes in Thailand?
Um,
uh,
I dunno,

1948
01:47:58.590 --> 01:48:01.770
I don't know that it's that much bigger than any other country.

1949
01:48:01.830 --> 01:48:04.590
I just think they really,
there's a section from there.
Yeah.

1950
01:48:04.740 --> 01:48:06.630
They were never conquered by the British or the French,

1951
01:48:06.631 --> 01:48:09.510
so they don't have the same sexual mores that we have.

1952
01:48:09.511 --> 01:48:13.590
So they're not as hung up about it in that regard.
So it's,
it's not,
you know,

1953
01:48:13.591 --> 01:48:15.780
that there's definitely a dark side to it.
No question.

1954
01:48:15.781 --> 01:48:17.700
But it's different than we experienced it over here,

1955
01:48:17.701 --> 01:48:22.470
like with our sex trade in our kind of bottom feeder mentality with it.
But,
um,

1956
01:48:22.560 --> 01:48:26.490
but the interesting thing is that the ones that you that are in the bars,

1957
01:48:26.491 --> 01:48:28.910
you see a hot chick in a bar,
uh,

1958
01:48:29.100 --> 01:48:33.240
just hanging out on in these like outdoor kind of,
you know,
Jimmy Buffet,

1959
01:48:33.241 --> 01:48:35.970
he looking bars where people are buying.
Margarita is getting fucked up,

1960
01:48:35.971 --> 01:48:40.470
watching kickboxing.
Then these are all girls.
These girls are all dudes.

1961
01:48:40.950 --> 01:48:41.970
Really?
Yeah.

1962
01:48:42.330 --> 01:48:46.920
And guys pick them up and they're closing everything else sounds awesome about

1963
01:48:46.921 --> 01:48:51.180
Thailand.
I'm like,
Margarita is kickboxing outside.
Greatest Pasa.

1964
01:48:51.510 --> 01:48:56.340
I need to go.
Yeah,
it's pretty awesome.
I was blown you.
Hm.
Well,

1965
01:48:56.341 --> 01:48:57.810
I mean,
as long as you keep your wits about you,

1966
01:48:57.811 --> 01:48:59.820
you have a buddy who keeps his wits about him,
you'll be fine.

1967
01:48:59.850 --> 01:49:02.430
What parts of Thailand have you ever been to Bangkok and Paquette?

1968
01:49:02.670 --> 01:49:06.300
I want him to go to boating.
There's a place that you can train in tiger.
Tiger.

1969
01:49:06.301 --> 01:49:08.310
Muy Thai.
Yeah.
Yeah.
And there's like,

1970
01:49:08.311 --> 01:49:10.370
apparently there's a nice resort that's really close by.

1971
01:49:10.380 --> 01:49:12.990
I thought about going there for a few days.
It's great.
What does Pooh cat like?

1972
01:49:13.050 --> 01:49:16.620
It's,
it's uh,
it's reminds me of Hawaii.
It's like a Hawaiian beach community.

1973
01:49:17.210 --> 01:49:21.600
So it's like very modern.
Very,
no,
but it's a steep,
yeah.

1974
01:49:21.601 --> 01:49:23.910
That section of it.
Is it safe for kids and shit?

1975
01:49:23.940 --> 01:49:26.910
Would you bring little kids over there?
Yes.
In the,
in your,

1976
01:49:27.120 --> 01:49:28.500
that resort where you're going to stay.
That's,

1977
01:49:28.501 --> 01:49:32.010
I'm pretty sure it's the same place I stayed that um,
yeah,
it's,

1978
01:49:32.040 --> 01:49:36.040
it's this total like community.
It's really cool.
Um,
yeah,
there,

1979
01:49:36.090 --> 01:49:40.050
there's no worries.
I wouldn't take them to Cambodia,
but they'd get eaten,
right?

1980
01:49:40.410 --> 01:49:44.440
No,
it's just the kids in Cambodia.
No,
they do not it.
But in between that,

1981
01:49:44.450 --> 01:49:48.050
just for the record,
but in bay shore,
in betweens for Cambodians.
So

1982
01:49:48.060 --> 01:49:48.231
<v 2>you know,</v>

1983
01:49:48.231 --> 01:49:52.240
when you look at a map and you see a border and it looks really fucking clean,

1984
01:49:52.360 --> 01:49:55.510
you go,
okay,
this is where this country ends.
This is where this country begins.

1985
01:49:55.560 --> 01:49:58.810
Okay.
You get to the edge of Thailand,
Cambodia,
that's not the case.

1986
01:49:59.290 --> 01:50:04.270
It's very blurry for like 15 miles.
So Cambodia,
their interest there?
No,

1987
01:50:04.271 --> 01:50:08.350
Cambodia is nice.
Tile is nice in between the two of them.
The gray area.
Yeah.

1988
01:50:08.380 --> 01:50:13.380
There are these cities that have no law governing them either way and they're

1989
01:50:13.901 --> 01:50:16.660
really fucked up.
And if you walk through there with a backpack on your reel,

1990
01:50:16.661 --> 01:50:20.230
you can fucking feel it,
man.
It's like a Tarantino movie waiting to happen.

1991
01:50:20.231 --> 01:50:23.200
You're just like,
this is fucked up.

1992
01:50:23.260 --> 01:50:24.610
And hikers go through there all the time there.

1993
01:50:24.700 --> 01:50:26.260
It's like American Werewolf in London.

1994
01:50:26.261 --> 01:50:29.560
Like just stay on the path and keep walking and you'll be in Cambodia.
Yeah.

1995
01:50:29.561 --> 01:50:33.520
Don't go into the saloons.
Don't do any of that.
Just to stay on the fucking road.

1996
01:50:33.840 --> 01:50:37.750
God Damn.
That's scary.
Fuck that.
I wrote about that once I wrote a,

1997
01:50:37.751 --> 01:50:41.110
I had an idea that I wrote about a gray area in between states.
Yeah.

1998
01:50:41.140 --> 01:50:44.950
That it would be like a Las Vegas extreme in every state because our states are

1999
01:50:44.951 --> 01:50:47.400
all governed by their own separate rules and yeah.
You know,

2000
01:50:47.410 --> 01:50:51.190
remember in Utah used to be that you had to buy alcohol in one section and

2001
01:50:51.191 --> 01:50:54.300
mixers in another section.
You had to show your id when you bought them.

2002
01:50:54.301 --> 01:50:58.540
And I was,
yeah.
Even in bars,
it was like really tricky.
But you go to Vegas,

2003
01:50:58.541 --> 01:50:59.350
you could buy,
you know,

2004
01:50:59.350 --> 01:51:03.580
Jack Daniels shots at seven o'clock in the morning out of a slurpee dispenser on

2005
01:51:03.581 --> 01:51:04.540
the street and don't give a fuck.

2006
01:51:04.720 --> 01:51:09.310
So almost like an extreme version of that in between every state where there was

2007
01:51:09.311 --> 01:51:13.660
a mile long area where it was a gray area where you're governed by very simple

2008
01:51:13.661 --> 01:51:16.300
laws like no murder,
no theft does it,

2009
01:51:16.301 --> 01:51:18.640
everything else do whatever the fuck you got to get help live in one of those

2010
01:51:18.641 --> 01:51:22.270
towns.
Will,
he sort of does,
but he lives in a kind of a boring place,
man.

2011
01:51:22.480 --> 01:51:24.010
He lives in Bisbee.

2012
01:51:24.060 --> 01:51:27.850
It's like he always complains if it's like an artist community,
but no one can.

2013
01:51:27.880 --> 01:51:30.140
No one's going to fucking sense of humor,
you know?
Understand.

2014
01:51:30.250 --> 01:51:33.510
Hope is a savage drunk.
Yes.
A psychopath's.
Right.
You know,

2015
01:51:33.520 --> 01:51:37.350
I'm sure he's laughing about a bunch of shit that these don't beat wearing

2016
01:51:37.370 --> 01:51:42.370
douchebag.
Hippies.
Yeah,
but I think near him,
like south of him,

2017
01:51:42.380 --> 01:51:45.370
that's where it starts to get a little,
are we in a state that still,

2018
01:51:45.380 --> 01:51:47.830
he is seven miles away from the Mexican border,
Bro.
Dude,

2019
01:51:47.831 --> 01:51:49.160
you've got his head cut off like that.

2020
01:51:49.170 --> 01:51:51.310
He and his girlfriend went out into the river or whatever,

2021
01:51:51.370 --> 01:51:55.270
or that mountain to the lake and they crossed the part of the lake that's Mexico

2022
01:51:55.540 --> 01:51:58.420
and they fucking got attacked and they cut his head off and mailed it back to

2023
01:51:58.421 --> 01:52:02.970
them or whatever.
Like,
fuck man.
Yeah,
but that's very show.

2024
01:52:02.980 --> 01:52:07.000
We're better with borders than almost anybody in the world.
We fucking know,
man.

2025
01:52:07.001 --> 01:52:11.140
We have a real issue,
you know?
And the issue's not Afghanistan.
It's not Iraq.

2026
01:52:11.200 --> 01:52:15.790
The issue is we are connected to a third world country in the middle of one of

2027
01:52:15.791 --> 01:52:18.670
the biggest drug wars made was ever known.
Dude,

2028
01:52:18.700 --> 01:52:22.480
people don't even realize how big the fucking situation is and how it's fucked.

2029
01:52:22.481 --> 01:52:26.470
It's crazy.
Yeah.
The amount of people that have died just this year.
I mean,

2030
01:52:26.471 --> 01:52:27.310
it's staggering.

2031
01:52:27.580 --> 01:52:31.480
Tens of thousands of people are doing the only growth industry in Mexico was

2032
01:52:31.481 --> 01:52:34.810
kidnapping.
Yeah.
It's really scary stuff,
man.
It's right there.
You know,

2033
01:52:34.811 --> 01:52:37.810
it's one of the reasons why I didn't want to move to San Diego and college

2034
01:52:37.811 --> 01:52:41.100
courses.
Well,
those little kids that are getting caught that are,
you know,

2035
01:52:41.190 --> 01:52:44.170
on cell phones,
they have their cell phones to showing torture.

2036
01:52:44.260 --> 01:52:46.250
I'll use little kids that are murderers for the drug cartels,

2037
01:52:46.250 --> 01:52:50.030
<v 3>12 years old,
murderers cutting people up and you know,
and video Turkey,</v>

2038
01:52:50.080 --> 01:52:54.240
<v 5>Sierra Leone.
I mean,
ultimately this is stuff that happens everywhere,
by the way.</v>

2039
01:52:54.330 --> 01:52:57.840
Not too different from early European stuff.
We just,
you know,

2040
01:52:57.841 --> 01:52:59.520
think of ourselves as past it now.

2041
01:52:59.650 --> 01:53:00.281
<v 3>Well,
the problem,</v>

2042
01:53:00.281 --> 01:53:03.490
the real true issue with Mexico is that there's no natural gas there and there's

2043
01:53:03.491 --> 01:53:04.061
no oil there.

2044
01:53:04.061 --> 01:53:08.710
There's not enough natural resources to warrant us taking troops over there and

2045
01:53:08.910 --> 01:53:12.520
you know,
stabilizing the area,
you know,
I mean,
nobody wants to,

2046
01:53:12.610 --> 01:53:14.260
and we don't want to admit it.
He wants to say that.
Yeah.

2047
01:53:14.261 --> 01:53:16.840
Nobody wants to say about drug.
Yeah.
Well,
by the way,
the drug money,

2048
01:53:16.841 --> 01:53:21.610
we're making money from those drought guaranteed 100% $500 million that the

2049
01:53:21.611 --> 01:53:23.430
economy would have collapsed even further than windows.

2050
01:53:23.500 --> 01:53:26.110
How frustrating it is because a,
you're a rational person.

2051
01:53:26.111 --> 01:53:29.560
How frustrating is it when you talk to regular people,
you know,

2052
01:53:29.590 --> 01:53:30.910
your average person,

2053
01:53:30.911 --> 01:53:33.700
you have a cocktail party or whatever and you sit down with some guys in

2054
01:53:33.701 --> 01:53:35.900
architect and you get into the conversation of,

2055
01:53:35.901 --> 01:53:40.840
of where drugs come from and people are so fucking naive and when you tell them

2056
01:53:40.841 --> 01:53:41.531
that,
you know,

2057
01:53:41.531 --> 01:53:44.680
there's a lot of evidence that the CIA brings drugs in this country,

2058
01:53:44.800 --> 01:53:49.450
they'll look at you like you are some fucking nut and you could tell them about

2059
01:53:49.600 --> 01:53:52.870
all these different cases where it's been proven true.
You can show,
you know,

2060
01:53:52.871 --> 01:53:57.190
reference,
you know,
Michael Rupert Books and Megan can reference,
you know,
uh,

2061
01:53:57.191 --> 01:53:59.680
all the,
the,
the,
the host,
the case with Barry Seal's in Mena,

2062
01:53:59.681 --> 01:54:01.330
Arkansas and all that shit that went down.

2063
01:54:01.840 --> 01:54:05.380
How about the CIA plane that crashed recently that had been at Guantanamo Bay on

2064
01:54:05.381 --> 01:54:06.580
at least two separate occasions,

2065
01:54:06.700 --> 01:54:10.300
crashed in Mexico with four tons of cocaine inside of it.
Right?

2066
01:54:10.570 --> 01:54:11.680
Like what the fuck?

2067
01:54:11.710 --> 01:54:13.420
<v 5>It's another form of currency that they use.</v>

2068
01:54:13.480 --> 01:54:15.700
It's on the books can currency essentially.

2069
01:54:15.760 --> 01:54:18.490
I mean they have to run their own money laundering cause the shit they're doing

2070
01:54:18.491 --> 01:54:21.220
is so far down the rabbit hole that they can't,

2071
01:54:21.530 --> 01:54:26.140
you can't actually take the cash itself.
The cash itself is too much of a marker.

2072
01:54:26.440 --> 01:54:29.200
The numbers on it would trace back to the government too much.

2073
01:54:29.201 --> 01:54:32.440
So they literally have,
it would be better to sell it for drugs,

2074
01:54:32.480 --> 01:54:37.480
like get drugs and change that money using drugs and then resell that drug for

2075
01:54:37.601 --> 01:54:41.500
another currency to hide what's going on and better that the American people

2076
01:54:41.501 --> 01:54:45.010
thought our tax dollars were buying cocaine than what we're actually doing with

2077
01:54:45.011 --> 01:54:45.430
it.

2078
01:54:45.430 --> 01:54:49.200
<v 3>Hmm.
Yeah.
Well I think it's just,
it's also the,</v>

2079
01:54:49.201 --> 01:54:52.090
they know that that's a way to make money and they know that that is going to

2080
01:54:52.091 --> 01:54:56.310
exist forever.
And you know,
why not just people need,
absolutely.
There's,

2081
01:54:56.320 --> 01:54:59.610
they find a way to justify that they're gonna use it for,
you know,
the,
the,
the,

2082
01:54:59.710 --> 01:55:02.670
the Sandinistas and the contracts.
Yeah.
During that extremely,

2083
01:55:02.690 --> 01:55:07.150
that was when they were accused of selling crack in,
uh,
the ghetto of course,

2084
01:55:07.250 --> 01:55:12.100
in using that money to fund foreign wars.
I mean,
it sounds completely ridiculous,

2085
01:55:12.101 --> 01:55:12.451
but what,

2086
01:55:12.451 --> 01:55:15.460
what's really crazy is when you have a conversation with someone and you bring

2087
01:55:15.461 --> 01:55:17.230
that up,
if you have a conversation with like,
you know,

2088
01:55:17.560 --> 01:55:20.890
just some normal person in your neighborhood somehow know that subject comes up,

2089
01:55:20.940 --> 01:55:23.770
you're a loon now,
right?
You're a loony do,
right?

2090
01:55:23.890 --> 01:55:28.150
You're that crazy guy who believes that CIA is selling drugs.

2091
01:55:28.710 --> 01:55:30.450
<v 5>Right.
But at a certain point,</v>

2092
01:55:30.451 --> 01:55:33.780
I think ultimately I've had a lot of those conversations were more and more

2093
01:55:33.781 --> 01:55:35.130
people are like,
well yeah,

2094
01:55:35.160 --> 01:55:39.090
I mean that happened in the 80s or that happens on occasion or you know,

2095
01:55:39.120 --> 01:55:43.050
guys go rogue and do stuff and blah,
blah blah.
But that's not you.

2096
01:55:43.200 --> 01:55:44.400
That's not the norm

2097
01:55:44.430 --> 01:55:45.420
<v 2>or whatever.
And like,
no,</v>

2098
01:55:45.421 --> 01:55:48.300
this is pretty much the price of doing business and you know,
and it,

2099
01:55:48.301 --> 01:55:51.510
when we're literally competing with other giant governments who are doing

2100
01:55:51.511 --> 01:55:53.430
exactly the same thing,
we're,
you know,
well,

2101
01:55:53.460 --> 01:55:57.570
we're not getting a real accurate sense of the landscape.
You know,

2102
01:55:57.571 --> 01:56:01.530
kids aren't being forced to read confessions of an economic hitman in high

2103
01:56:01.531 --> 01:56:03.120
school.
You know,
they should be,

2104
01:56:03.121 --> 01:56:06.990
you should be forced to watch a bunch of different documentaries on what we do

2105
01:56:06.991 --> 01:56:10.590
with money and other countries and how we get their resources and how we,

2106
01:56:10.591 --> 01:56:13.380
you know,
give them loans that can ever possibly pay back.

2107
01:56:13.400 --> 01:56:15.540
And the whole idea is that we're trying to help them,

2108
01:56:15.541 --> 01:56:17.790
but really what we're trying to do is get them attached to debt.

2109
01:56:18.030 --> 01:56:21.000
And once we get the mantra of servitude for the Pharaohs did ultimately,

2110
01:56:21.001 --> 01:56:21.470
you know,

2111
01:56:21.470 --> 01:56:24.360
that was the difference between the slavery of during the pharaohs time was the

2112
01:56:24.361 --> 01:56:27.150
idea that you would intentionally indenture yourself for a time.

2113
01:56:27.300 --> 01:56:30.910
And then over that time,
like,
uh,
like,
uh,
you know,
this illusion of the second,

2114
01:56:30.920 --> 01:56:33.540
you know,
like how the sex trade runs,
you know,
you'll,
you know what,

2115
01:56:33.930 --> 01:56:34.890
we'll give you $20,000,

2116
01:56:34.891 --> 01:56:38.130
we get you to the state and you work it off with your vagina and then eventually

2117
01:56:38.131 --> 01:56:40.450
you'll be free,
but then you're never free.
Yeah.
You know,

2118
01:56:40.460 --> 01:56:41.900
keep moving the goalposts.
Sure.

2119
01:56:41.910 --> 01:56:44.640
The Pharaohs did that and that's why everybody got pissed in Split.

2120
01:56:44.730 --> 01:56:46.170
Well that's how they do it in the Middle East.

2121
01:56:46.171 --> 01:56:49.740
When the building giant buildings and do that and bring these portfolios in from

2122
01:56:49.741 --> 01:56:52.800
India and these third world,
China's when,
when I was in Beijing they were,

2123
01:56:52.830 --> 01:56:54.900
they were ripping up the WHO tongs in preparation,

2124
01:56:54.901 --> 01:56:59.790
which are these essentially these like mud walled ghettos in the center of the

2125
01:56:59.791 --> 01:57:01.980
city right in front of the Forbidden City.
In the,

2126
01:57:02.070 --> 01:57:06.570
what used to be the emperor's garden are these like low walled houses with nine

2127
01:57:06.571 --> 01:57:10.140
families using one to a whole as a toilet and the whole thing it would be like

2128
01:57:10.141 --> 01:57:12.600
as if central park was,
was a tent city.

2129
01:57:12.750 --> 01:57:15.930
Imagine that and then eventually that tends to be turned into,
you know,

2130
01:57:15.931 --> 01:57:19.410
literally just mud crusted bricks that they made themselves in a hole that they

2131
01:57:19.510 --> 01:57:23.170
shouldn't.
Yeah.
Over in the middle of their house.
Well there's a drain in,

2132
01:57:23.180 --> 01:57:24.930
it drains out into the street.
It's really awful.

2133
01:57:24.960 --> 01:57:27.690
So you just hang your ass over the hole and just drop it into a sort of

2134
01:57:27.960 --> 01:57:31.300
basically how many fall in there every now and I'm sure can't not

2135
01:57:32.830 --> 01:57:36.610
drowning and ship.
What was that movie that recently came out that,
that,
that,

2136
01:57:36.620 --> 01:57:40.290
that guy kid fell in?
It was like a kid movie.
Had to jump in there to hide.
No.

2137
01:57:40.291 --> 01:57:44.340
What was that movie?
Uh,
jumped in the toilet.
The hotline?
Yeah.
Not a good movie.

2138
01:57:44.950 --> 01:57:49.910
[inaudible] [inaudible] all the Indians,
Indian kids,
a slum dog millionaire.

2139
01:57:50.990 --> 01:57:51.823
Was that good?

2140
01:57:52.390 --> 01:57:55.860
And Lady Hawk actually that you know that Matthew Broderick Rutger Hauer movie

2141
01:57:55.861 --> 01:57:58.380
with the Alan Parsons Project.
Weird score.

2142
01:57:58.670 --> 01:58:01.500
I never saw that either cause an eighties movie,

2143
01:58:01.501 --> 01:58:04.440
but that Matthew Broderick is his plays,
this character fleet,

2144
01:58:04.441 --> 01:58:07.650
the mouse who's a contortionist and he's a thief and he escapes from the

2145
01:58:07.651 --> 01:58:08.640
dungeons of Aquila,

2146
01:58:08.641 --> 01:58:12.150
which nobody has ever escaped war by basically cracking his bones and sliding

2147
01:58:12.151 --> 01:58:15.300
his way through.
Oh Wow.
It's amazing.
But through this sewer,

2148
01:58:15.700 --> 01:58:18.290
a dude named Lee Marie,
that was a,

2149
01:58:18.300 --> 01:58:23.200
he's a bank heist guy from England who was trying to get out of his chair,

2150
01:58:23.250 --> 01:58:27.980
his cage by starving himself so small that he could slip through the bars.

2151
01:58:28.340 --> 01:58:32.430
Like he was starving himself to try to get skinny enough to slip through his

2152
01:58:32.431 --> 01:58:37.320
cage.
Well as you would do after awhile.
Yeah.
But that's retarded.

2153
01:58:37.321 --> 01:58:38.130
You're not going to do,

2154
01:58:38.130 --> 01:58:40.740
don't you think the bars are too small for you to do that?
Well,

2155
01:58:41.350 --> 01:58:42.310
what they do is they measure

2156
01:58:42.310 --> 01:58:45.040
<v 5>you.
They make sure your skull and your hips can't get through.
Yeah.
Come on man.</v>

2157
01:58:45.041 --> 01:58:47.570
You ain't getting through them.
Yeah,
right.
That's right.
But uh,
yeah.

2158
01:58:47.710 --> 01:58:51.460
Desperate man.
Where were we anyways?
Yeah,
the,

2159
01:58:51.610 --> 01:58:56.140
we really went like sideways.
I blame the Lady Hawk reference and that was,

2160
01:58:56.520 --> 01:59:01.140
I really,
totally weird.
But,
um,
and who tongs in China,

2161
01:59:01.190 --> 01:59:05.230
basically to live in Beijing,
to live in the big city,
you had to have,

2162
01:59:05.300 --> 01:59:09.220
you have to have a card that says you live there.
It's like as if New York said,

2163
01:59:09.221 --> 01:59:11.230
look,
there's too many fucking people in New York.
Yes.

2164
01:59:11.231 --> 01:59:14.860
Everybody wants to live here.
But since we don't charge for rent anymore,

2165
01:59:14.861 --> 01:59:17.950
it's a communist society.
We got to have a hierarchy of some sort.

2166
01:59:17.970 --> 01:59:20.980
Either have to have lived here a long time or you got to give something up,

2167
01:59:21.000 --> 01:59:25.360
take the lid off.
They don't pay any rent at all.
No.
Um,
well you,
you can,
uh,

2168
01:59:25.361 --> 01:59:27.610
outsiders do and there's a,
it's a weird system,

2169
01:59:27.611 --> 01:59:29.710
but essentially that you can get a better place by paying,

2170
01:59:29.890 --> 01:59:32.050
but essentially your basic level stuff is there.

2171
01:59:32.051 --> 01:59:35.320
So what they would do is they would go to these little towns,

2172
01:59:35.321 --> 01:59:37.630
which were a piece of shit towns that they were having the communist party was

2173
01:59:37.631 --> 01:59:38.680
having to maintain.

2174
01:59:38.681 --> 01:59:41.830
I have to run water out to these dipshit towns that have nothing to offer.

2175
01:59:42.070 --> 01:59:43.610
They're just out there and they had to provide for them.

2176
01:59:43.611 --> 01:59:46.540
Then they'd go into the town,
they go,
alright,
everybody out.

2177
01:59:46.930 --> 01:59:50.560
We're taking all the wiring back in the plumbing back and we're taking all the

2178
01:59:50.620 --> 01:59:53.740
concrete and everything.
We're going to pulverize this whole city.

2179
01:59:53.890 --> 01:59:58.110
And this whole town is going to live in a high rise in Beijing that you're going

2180
01:59:58.111 --> 02:00:02.050
to build yourself.
So we're going to give you the construction for two years.

2181
02:00:02.200 --> 02:00:04.750
The best workers here are going to go into the city.

2182
02:00:05.050 --> 02:00:08.800
You're going to work on this tower.
And then by the time the towers finished,

2183
02:00:08.801 --> 02:00:11.200
everybody moves into it and we'll just pulverize the whole city.

2184
02:00:11.350 --> 02:00:12.670
It's as if we went to Fairfield,

2185
02:00:12.671 --> 02:00:15.820
California or some small town where the industry has left.

2186
02:00:15.821 --> 02:00:20.821
So what's the hook that there is none other than you don't get to have your old

2187
02:00:20.891 --> 02:00:22.480
town in your nice little village.

2188
02:00:22.510 --> 02:00:25.990
So they actually do build this place and they actually do live in.
Yep.
Okay.

2189
02:00:25.991 --> 02:00:30.580
So it's not the same as like what's happening,
you know,
but no,
but the,
but yeah,

2190
02:00:30.581 --> 02:00:32.740
no,
they actually pay off eventually,
but,

2191
02:00:33.040 --> 02:00:36.160
but that's the good version of it or whatever.
In Dubai,
they just,
you know,

2192
02:00:36.190 --> 02:00:39.100
in Dubai it's interesting because they stopped paying and the fucking workers

2193
02:00:39.101 --> 02:00:40.300
just started walking home.

2194
02:00:40.870 --> 02:00:43.750
It just all pack their shit and started walking to the edge of town.

2195
02:00:43.780 --> 02:00:46.870
That whole place is so crazy that we've ever been there.
So yeah.
Yeah,

2196
02:00:47.900 --> 02:00:52.630
it's such a high level and then it just kind of all came crashing down based on

2197
02:00:52.631 --> 02:00:52.750
it.

2198
02:00:52.750 --> 02:00:55.900
It's a resource based economy and limited resource based economy and you can't

2199
02:00:56.170 --> 02:00:59.350
eventually that's going to go dry no matter if it's now or 50 years from now.

2200
02:00:59.540 --> 02:01:01.540
You're banking your whole worth on oil.

2201
02:01:01.541 --> 02:01:04.870
These fuckers are going to be hocking rugs like they were in the fifties sooner

2202
02:01:04.871 --> 02:01:07.600
than they know it and it's going to be a creepy period for them.
Well,

2203
02:01:07.601 --> 02:01:10.690
they also have debtor's prisons,
so you can't be,
you can't be in debt,

2204
02:01:10.691 --> 02:01:13.570
you can't just go bankrupt over there.
They lock you up in jail.
Right.

2205
02:01:13.571 --> 02:01:15.820
So a lot of people,
they parked their Mercedes at the airport,

2206
02:01:15.821 --> 02:01:18.130
got on a flight and just left everything.
But hopefully like,

2207
02:01:18.131 --> 02:01:20.510
I don't want to be in jail.
Fuck you and your country take care.

2208
02:01:20.560 --> 02:01:23.650
Exactly what people were living there.
Like Michael Jackson was living there.

2209
02:01:23.651 --> 02:01:25.630
Right.
I mean,
it got to be this,
you know,

2210
02:01:25.631 --> 02:01:29.700
really the idea of this enchanted paradise place where millionaires when just

2211
02:01:29.701 --> 02:01:30.970
sounds like nuts and sounds like,

2212
02:01:31.020 --> 02:01:33.550
it sounds like the Las Vegas run by southern Baptists.

2213
02:01:34.090 --> 02:01:36.070
The whole thing was really fascinated.
Religious police.

2214
02:01:36.071 --> 02:01:40.730
Like I got them called on me during my show.
Ooh,
during your show in Dubai.

2215
02:01:40.760 --> 02:01:45.710
Yeah,
I was,
I was,
I was doing a show with Jon Lovitz of all people,
I guess.

2216
02:01:45.770 --> 02:01:49.160
And,
um,
he,
he,
I was,
I did the verse 45,

2217
02:01:49.161 --> 02:01:52.210
he did the second 45 and I introduced him in between show,
you know,

2218
02:01:52.230 --> 02:01:56.280
our shows and I come out in this,
uh,
and um,
so I'm up on stage and um,

2219
02:01:56.310 --> 02:01:58.910
I had gone up to the top of the Burj Khalifa,
the tower,

2220
02:01:58.911 --> 02:02:00.260
the tallest building in the world.

2221
02:02:00.260 --> 02:02:04.640
I've now been in four of the tallest structures in the school,
whatever,
blah,

2222
02:02:04.641 --> 02:02:06.950
blah,
blah.
I feel like it's pretty,
it's actually,

2223
02:02:07.150 --> 02:02:09.290
you know what it looks like it's the same view.
You get an a landing airplane,

2224
02:02:09.291 --> 02:02:12.960
you know when you're flying into lax and you're over that what would be Pasadena

2225
02:02:12.961 --> 02:02:15.260
and all that shit.
You're that high in the air.
That's what it looks like.

2226
02:02:15.290 --> 02:02:18.440
I would just start shitting and pissing him off.
He's like pass out,

2227
02:02:18.470 --> 02:02:21.260
but it's all dirt.
It's terrible.
And I,
I even said like,

2228
02:02:21.261 --> 02:02:24.830
I think it's great you guys built a tower that high because that's dirt looks

2229
02:02:24.831 --> 02:02:29.000
its best from about 3000 feet.
You know what I mean?
Dirt up close sucks,

2230
02:02:29.001 --> 02:02:31.580
but all this dirt so great to see it.
Cause there's no,

2231
02:02:31.790 --> 02:02:35.540
they implant any fucking trees.
It's all construction.
It looks like shit.
So,

2232
02:02:36.130 --> 02:02:37.880
and they don't even like the biggest observation.

2233
02:02:37.880 --> 02:02:39.020
Dick doesn't even face the water,

2234
02:02:39.021 --> 02:02:41.660
the Caspian Sea cause they wanted to impress people with what the city looks

2235
02:02:41.661 --> 02:02:43.670
like.
So they put the observation deck on the inside will,

2236
02:02:43.671 --> 02:02:46.940
the city hasn't been built yet.
So bullshit.
Anyway,
so I go up to the top of it.

2237
02:02:47.300 --> 02:02:50.150
It was originally called the Burj Dubai based on the city,

2238
02:02:50.540 --> 02:02:52.910
the shake Khalifa,
the,

2239
02:02:53.000 --> 02:02:56.780
the president of the UAE gave them $10 billion to finish the tower.

2240
02:02:56.781 --> 02:03:00.590
$10 billion to finish it because it didn't look like he was gonna.

2241
02:03:00.800 --> 02:03:03.650
And so on opening day they decided,
you know what,
fuck this,

2242
02:03:03.651 --> 02:03:07.550
we're going to name it Burj Khalifa after him,
like this impulse thing.

2243
02:03:08.150 --> 02:03:11.000
But you go up in it.
And I was one of the first 200 people to go up in it,

2244
02:03:11.030 --> 02:03:12.440
you know,
and um,

2245
02:03:12.800 --> 02:03:16.400
and I go up and the gift shop all has shit that says Burj Dubai on it.

2246
02:03:16.401 --> 02:03:20.000
And it's the same bullshit gift shop crap you'd find at the Sears tower or in

2247
02:03:20.001 --> 02:03:24.500
Disneyland.
It's fucking golf shirts and,
and pocket knives and bottle openers.

2248
02:03:24.501 --> 02:03:27.620
And they all have Burj Dubai paperweights where there's water in it and you can

2249
02:03:27.621 --> 02:03:31.270
shake it comes on their little towers,
no snake sandstorm.
Maybe

2250
02:03:33.200 --> 02:03:37.460
it's stupid like eh,
but it all still said Burj Dubai on it.
I'm like,

2251
02:03:37.490 --> 02:03:41.480
this motherfucker gives you $10 billion and you can't replace the bullshit

2252
02:03:41.481 --> 02:03:44.570
printed shirts in 24 hours.
What did you say this?
Yes.

2253
02:03:44.840 --> 02:03:49.310
So I basically what I said on stage was it's pretty rude to monsieur Khalifa.

2254
02:03:49.370 --> 02:03:50.960
I think that you,
you know,

2255
02:03:50.980 --> 02:03:54.140
you did this or whatever because I'm not paying for my hotel room.

2256
02:03:54.141 --> 02:03:56.660
But when I call room service,
they say,
they say yes,
Mr. Sparks.

2257
02:03:56.661 --> 02:03:59.540
They don't say the guy who was in the room before me,
you know?
And,

2258
02:04:00.170 --> 02:04:03.230
and I was actually trying to say something deferential,
respectful to the guy,

2259
02:04:03.500 --> 02:04:04.640
you know.
Well,

2260
02:04:04.641 --> 02:04:09.641
it was the fact that I said Monsieur Khalifa instead of shake Khalifa that drove

2261
02:04:09.891 --> 02:04:13.880
this one guy crazy and he stood up in the back like eight tables back and people

2262
02:04:13.881 --> 02:04:17.270
were laughing.
So I didn't see this happen.
He was back in the dark

2263
02:04:18.800 --> 02:04:22.400
and he storms out of the fucking place.
Whoa.
I walk off stage to finish my set.

2264
02:04:22.401 --> 02:04:24.320
It was great set.
Actually.
I had a great time and it was,

2265
02:04:24.321 --> 02:04:26.780
he's like $40,000 tables,
you know,

2266
02:04:26.781 --> 02:04:30.650
Evers round tables in the front full of shakes and these guys I can and women in

2267
02:04:30.651 --> 02:04:32.420
their hijabs and Burkas and the whole deal.

2268
02:04:32.870 --> 02:04:35.660
And then there are business partners from the west,
so it's really weird.

2269
02:04:35.750 --> 02:04:39.990
So I go off stage and promoters there and he goes,
uh,
yeah.
Uh,

2270
02:04:40.410 --> 02:04:44.520
you said something that offended one of the shakes who was here and so he called

2271
02:04:44.610 --> 02:04:45.990
the CID,
the religious police,

2272
02:04:45.991 --> 02:04:49.950
and they're here and they're going to take you into custody.
We'll try to,
yeah,

2273
02:04:49.980 --> 02:04:53.760
this is fucked.
That,
wow.
We'll try and mitigate it as much as we can.

2274
02:04:54.210 --> 02:04:58.350
But the fine could be as much as $25,000 and three days in jail.
And,

2275
02:04:58.351 --> 02:05:00.930
but we'll try and talk them down and it might not be a big deal because we're

2276
02:05:00.931 --> 02:05:02.760
not even sure what he was upset about yet.

2277
02:05:02.761 --> 02:05:05.730
And we'll try to talk to them about it.
But can you go out,
take this out,

2278
02:05:05.880 --> 02:05:07.530
can you go out and introduce John?

2279
02:05:07.860 --> 02:05:12.570
Fuck and then come back and we'll deal with it.
So I walk out on stage and I,

2280
02:05:12.710 --> 02:05:17.160
I go up on stage and I introduced John and as I'm on there,

2281
02:05:17.190 --> 02:05:20.430
as I'm onstage introducing them,
I see them come down the aisle,

2282
02:05:20.460 --> 02:05:23.010
I see the religious police,
these,
these,
uh,

2283
02:05:23.400 --> 02:05:27.990
there are three of them in these white shirts with their little belts across

2284
02:05:27.991 --> 02:05:31.020
their chest and a little,
you know,
stick holsters and stuff.

2285
02:05:31.230 --> 02:05:36.230
And they're walking down the aisle towards backstage and they go backstage and I

2286
02:05:36.541 --> 02:05:39.300
introduced John and instead of going backstage,

2287
02:05:39.330 --> 02:05:43.140
I walk straight off the stage and walk right out to the lobby where they had a

2288
02:05:43.141 --> 02:05:45.000
table set up for me to sell shit and sign things.

2289
02:05:45.270 --> 02:05:49.080
Whereas where I had intended to go in the first place,
but I walked,
I just,

2290
02:05:49.081 --> 02:05:51.420
instead of going backstage and I went straight out front,
I'm like,

2291
02:05:51.450 --> 02:05:53.280
they'll find me out there.
They're gonna find me,
they gonna find me,

2292
02:05:53.281 --> 02:05:56.070
but I'm going to go out there and do that shit first and let them stew.

2293
02:05:56.100 --> 02:05:58.850
You have to sell your merge.
Yeah.
Right.
So I go,

2294
02:05:58.851 --> 02:06:02.110
so I go outside and I'm taking in a bunch of pictures and shit up there and

2295
02:06:02.120 --> 02:06:05.400
totally and DVDs and,
and it took pictures and blah blah.

2296
02:06:05.700 --> 02:06:09.810
And I had a bunch of people come out because John is Jewish,
I'm not Jewish.

2297
02:06:09.840 --> 02:06:12.750
And they definitely have issues with Jews there.
So a lot of them came,

2298
02:06:12.751 --> 02:06:17.610
saw me and didn't stick around towards the Jew.
Right.
Assholes.

2299
02:06:17.700 --> 02:06:19.010
Anyway,
so they come out,
I'm,

2300
02:06:19.270 --> 02:06:23.400
and these guys are back there for 10 fucking minutes before they realize he's

2301
02:06:23.401 --> 02:06:26.420
not coming back.
Right.
And so they could turn around and come out to the office.

2302
02:06:26.460 --> 02:06:27.600
And right when they walk out,

2303
02:06:27.660 --> 02:06:30.690
I'm getting a picture with a shake and his wife like this,
like,

2304
02:06:30.960 --> 02:06:33.780
like you were in fucking Wisconsin arm around both of them.

2305
02:06:33.840 --> 02:06:38.430
Big stupid grin there,
smiling.
He's got his fucking classic sunglasses,

2306
02:06:38.431 --> 02:06:42.090
White Shawl.
The whole deal is white burqa.
You can't even see your fucking,

2307
02:06:42.300 --> 02:06:45.240
this is it.
And I'm just a big smiley picture.

2308
02:06:45.270 --> 02:06:50.250
I'm assuming she's smiling and um,
and they,
they come out and they go,
well,

2309
02:06:50.251 --> 02:06:52.620
if he hadn't said anything offensive,
these people would be,

2310
02:06:52.650 --> 02:06:53.730
they would not take a picture with him.

2311
02:06:53.760 --> 02:06:56.070
This shaker would a dealer and his wife would not be taking pictures if he said

2312
02:06:56.071 --> 02:06:57.870
anything would have saying they'd saw it.
They watch.

2313
02:06:58.180 --> 02:07:02.040
So they basically said he's not,
he didn't offend anybody because if he did,

2314
02:07:02.041 --> 02:07:04.650
the would be mad too.
And so they went to the,
uh,

2315
02:07:04.651 --> 02:07:07.110
the shake who was standing by the doorway.
I didn't know who it was,

2316
02:07:07.111 --> 02:07:09.560
but apparently he was standing.
He said they walked over with their arms crossed.

2317
02:07:09.561 --> 02:07:12.150
What did he say?
What was the big and he goes,
well it wasn't what he said.

2318
02:07:12.290 --> 02:07:14.070
I was just thought that other people might get defendant.

2319
02:07:14.071 --> 02:07:17.400
He started backtracking on what he said.
Oh.

2320
02:07:17.460 --> 02:07:22.200
So they stuck around and watched John Show for about 10 minutes to make sure he

2321
02:07:22.201 --> 02:07:23.400
wasn't doing anything untoward.

2322
02:07:23.401 --> 02:07:26.290
And I think they ended up finding him $25,000 fine.

2323
02:07:26.310 --> 02:07:29.690
John 25,000 mentioning his Judaism too much.

2324
02:07:31.080 --> 02:07:35.040
Fuck that.
Yeah.
Don't ever go there.
Here's the other.
Yeah Dude.

2325
02:07:35.080 --> 02:07:38.650
Like God dude.
So cause it wasn't anything else.
I mean he does this thing.

2326
02:07:38.651 --> 02:07:41.820
Bob Saget is gay.
This song he does,
which like might've been it.

2327
02:07:41.821 --> 02:07:45.580
Cause you're mentioning homosexuality is worse than mentioning Judaism there.

2328
02:07:45.580 --> 02:07:48.950
I think almost two.
They conflate the two.
But it's psycho.

2329
02:07:49.090 --> 02:07:53.770
I mean it's crazy behavior.
Imagine if Fred Phelps,
his family ran Vegas.

2330
02:07:54.280 --> 02:07:58.240
Who's Fred Phelps?
The Westboro baptist.
Yeah.
God hates fags out of Oregon.

2331
02:07:58.270 --> 02:08:03.010
I was like,
imagine if they ran Vegas.
Oh my God.
Every time you were,

2332
02:08:03.060 --> 02:08:04.270
you were having a great time in Vegas.

2333
02:08:04.360 --> 02:08:07.390
You had to like kind of stop and make sure that nobody went and told Fred Phelps

2334
02:08:07.391 --> 02:08:10.560
is fans,
you have reservations go in there and performing there or do we like,
oh,

2335
02:08:10.570 --> 02:08:13.210
it'll be okay.
I not really,

2336
02:08:13.211 --> 02:08:16.660
I felt okay about what I was going to say and I knew that like that was an
issue,

2337
02:08:16.661 --> 02:08:19.810
but I didn't think I was going through my act going is there anything that

2338
02:08:19.811 --> 02:08:23.380
they're going to come Hutch,
did you swear?
Do you swear at all?
Yeah.
Yeah.

2339
02:08:23.381 --> 02:08:26.500
This is a training problem.
No,
they didn't.
They weren't bothered by sexual stuff.

2340
02:08:26.530 --> 02:08:31.510
You love to talk about sexual stuff.
Yeah.
Really?
Yeah.
How much soup?
B level,

2341
02:08:32.050 --> 02:08:36.400
I mean not by be.
You talked about popping pussies and stuff and I known I would.

2342
02:08:36.410 --> 02:08:39.640
You wouldn't go there.
What is,
what is popping?
Posing?
That's what you snap it.

2343
02:08:40.090 --> 02:08:43.330
What do you do with your fingers?
No,
you just pop it.
How do you do that?

2344
02:08:43.360 --> 02:08:46.270
Just pop it.
What the fuck does,
I don't know what that means.
The songs about it,

2345
02:08:46.271 --> 02:08:47.710
you know,
two live crew pop that pussy.

2346
02:08:48.250 --> 02:08:51.220
I think they just don't find that on Youtube.
Whatever you do.

2347
02:08:51.221 --> 02:08:55.690
I see the little fingers moving.
Yeah.
Cut The shit young man.
So I,
yeah,
I just,

2348
02:08:55.810 --> 02:08:58.420
I was more interested in just the experience of going there.

2349
02:08:58.421 --> 02:09:02.170
Like this should be really fucking good.
Yeah.
We did the UFC and Abu Dhabi,

2350
02:09:02.260 --> 02:09:04.090
it's a job is different.
It's interesting.

2351
02:09:04.091 --> 02:09:06.130
There's a different tone between that and Dubai.

2352
02:09:06.190 --> 02:09:10.000
I refuse to fly into Dubai for that reason.
I didn't want to fly in there dude.

2353
02:09:10.510 --> 02:09:12.720
And plus I knew how they,
what they did with their labor,

2354
02:09:12.730 --> 02:09:14.590
how they got these people from third world countries.

2355
02:09:14.591 --> 02:09:16.930
They promised them an extreme amount of money and then when they get through the

2356
02:09:16.931 --> 02:09:19.660
take their passports away and give them a fraction of their money.
Right.

2357
02:09:19.690 --> 02:09:23.740
They live in squalor conditions.
Like I don't want to be connected.
Totally.
Yeah.

2358
02:09:23.770 --> 02:09:24.940
I don't want to feel that.
Yeah.

2359
02:09:24.970 --> 02:09:27.880
Well at this point it was already kind of on its downward arc and I was just

2360
02:09:27.881 --> 02:09:32.260
curious as shit to see like where everything,
cause it was literally like cranes.

2361
02:09:32.560 --> 02:09:36.580
It was something stupid.
Like 22% of the worlds' cranes.

2362
02:09:36.940 --> 02:09:41.080
We're in Dubai.
And as they were showing gains,
yeah,

2363
02:09:41.110 --> 02:09:43.930
he goes cranes in the use to build the world's tallest building.

2364
02:09:43.930 --> 02:09:48.070
Like what the fuck dude,
man.
Yeah.
Stupid.
Yeah.
So,

2365
02:09:48.071 --> 02:09:51.280
and by the way,
the Burj Khalifa,
the tallest building in the world,

2366
02:09:51.400 --> 02:09:53.500
they decided they want the world's biggest mall as well.

2367
02:09:53.800 --> 02:09:55.800
So they bailed it at the base.
Okay.

2368
02:09:55.980 --> 02:09:58.360
The biggest building has the biggest mall in the world.
Okay.

2369
02:09:58.361 --> 02:10:01.510
And they decided to use bigger than the mall of America.
Yes.
They took,

2370
02:10:01.511 --> 02:10:04.860
by the way,
the way they did it was they proud,
but people,

2371
02:10:04.950 --> 02:10:08.790
they decided to take the design for the mall of America and duplicate it.

2372
02:10:08.950 --> 02:10:12.130
So they basically in double it,
that's what they did.
Those cunts.
Exactly.

2373
02:10:12.220 --> 02:10:15.040
And you know what?
It isn't shit.
Mall of America is basically round.

2374
02:10:15.070 --> 02:10:15.903
It is obvious.

2375
02:10:15.970 --> 02:10:19.030
So there are these two giant balls at the base of the Burj Khalifa.

2376
02:10:19.031 --> 02:10:22.250
It is the biggest,
dumbest Phallus you have ever seen in your life.

2377
02:10:22.251 --> 02:10:25.120
It's so fucking obvious to this.
The most attractive thing you said all night.

2378
02:10:25.121 --> 02:10:28.250
I want to go to that mall right now.
Right.
Me Too.
By the way,
I'm a small way.

2379
02:10:28.251 --> 02:10:31.750
You go into the top is through the mall.

2380
02:10:31.751 --> 02:10:34.310
You start in one of the balls and go through this writing.

2381
02:10:34.400 --> 02:10:37.850
<v 3>How is their food court?
Is it good?
It's ridiculous.
Cause they're good.</v>

2382
02:10:37.930 --> 02:10:41.510
They have cinnamon.
No,
it's just in such,
in a bond.
Not Good.

2383
02:10:41.750 --> 02:10:44.630
Well I mean they have,
they better have Starbucks and cinnamon.
I,
yeah,

2384
02:10:44.930 --> 02:10:47.300
well I guess,
yeah,
technically they do have Starbucks.
I don't,

2385
02:10:47.301 --> 02:10:49.100
I don't know remember seeing it,
but they had like,

2386
02:10:49.370 --> 02:10:54.370
they had candied dates with caramelized almonds inside them,

2387
02:10:54.531 --> 02:10:59.070
wrapped in like a leaf of vanilla frosting or something like,
and box,

2388
02:10:59.130 --> 02:11:03.680
just rows and rows.
Cause that's,
you know,
and they were fucking amazing.

2389
02:11:03.681 --> 02:11:06.170
I brought boxes of 'em back to everybody.
That was the thing.

2390
02:11:06.180 --> 02:11:08.440
Middle East is quite a trip,
man.
Um,

2391
02:11:08.450 --> 02:11:11.300
one thing I wanted to get into with you before we wrap this thing up,

2392
02:11:11.630 --> 02:11:14.600
early five 30,
Geez,
I've read,
I've,
I've seen a lot of shit.

2393
02:11:14.601 --> 02:11:16.640
One thing that I saw that really brought my,
uh,

2394
02:11:16.700 --> 02:11:21.320
brought my attention to you was you got interviewed at the airport about nine

2395
02:11:21.321 --> 02:11:25.070
11.
And it was,
uh,
it was pretty fascinating because,
you know,

2396
02:11:25.071 --> 02:11:29.930
there's two groups of people usually that,
um,
you know,
when it comes to nine 11,

2397
02:11:30.140 --> 02:11:34.190
there's these people that say,
well,
you know,
obviously,
you know,
uh,

2398
02:11:34.210 --> 02:11:37.760
the government makes mistakes,
but you know,
this was a,
this was,

2399
02:11:37.761 --> 02:11:42.020
we were attacked by,
you know,
some,
some,
you know,
a terrorist organization.

2400
02:11:42.021 --> 02:11:45.920
There's a reason why we're in these places over overseas and we're there to make

2401
02:11:45.921 --> 02:11:47.900
sure that we can have freedom here.
And then there's another,

2402
02:11:47.960 --> 02:11:50.870
there's another group of people that think,
hey,
something happened here.

2403
02:11:50.871 --> 02:11:53.510
This is an inside job.
There's a lot of people,
there's a lot of,
you know,

2404
02:11:53.511 --> 02:11:54.920
there's a lot of facts that don't jive.

2405
02:11:54.921 --> 02:11:56.270
There's a lot of information that doesn't job,

2406
02:11:56.600 --> 02:12:01.040
but a lot of those people are crazy.
Yes.
And a lot of those,
those,
you know,

2407
02:12:01.041 --> 02:12:03.710
nine 11 truther is like you listen to them and there's,
you know,

2408
02:12:03.711 --> 02:12:04.880
you know the expression,

2409
02:12:05.320 --> 02:12:09.590
the term confirmation bias where you're looking for information that's going to

2410
02:12:09.591 --> 02:12:13.730
confirm your suspicions instead of just be composed.
Religion is based on that.

2411
02:12:13.820 --> 02:12:17.720
Yeah.
Nine 11 is the biggest religion thing for that.
It's a,
it's,

2412
02:12:17.721 --> 02:12:19.790
it's a crazy thing.
Sure one.

2413
02:12:19.850 --> 02:12:24.850
But one thing that's been to me proven that even,

2414
02:12:25.070 --> 02:12:28.280
I don't know what happened on nine 11 I don't know if there was government

2415
02:12:28.281 --> 02:12:32.390
complicity.
I don't know.
I don't know if you know the,
the,
the statements of,

2416
02:12:32.570 --> 02:12:36.140
you know,
Wolfsburg and Rumsfeld and Dick Cheney,

2417
02:12:36.141 --> 02:12:39.470
I don't know how many of those are accurate and how many of those we need a new

2418
02:12:39.471 --> 02:12:42.320
Pearl Harbor.
And you know,
I don't know how much of that is real,

2419
02:12:42.620 --> 02:12:44.690
but I do know that if they did do it,

2420
02:12:44.930 --> 02:12:47.920
they could pull it off because I'm paying attention to the way people were

2421
02:12:47.921 --> 02:12:52.100
reacting to some people that refuse to think that it's possible that the

2422
02:12:52.101 --> 02:12:54.620
government would ever be involved in anything shady at all.

2423
02:12:54.740 --> 02:12:59.150
There's a giant group of,
you know,
love or leave it,
there's a giant gods,

2424
02:12:59.151 --> 02:13:02.600
guns and government group in this country.
Yeah.
You could pull off,

2425
02:13:02.601 --> 02:13:04.610
almost everything can count on it.
You can,
you can,

2426
02:13:04.850 --> 02:13:09.770
you can literally bank on their how they're going to read stuff.
Yes,
exactly.

2427
02:13:09.771 --> 02:13:13.100
The Sarah Pailin book signing people,
you know,
they're waiting in line,
you know,

2428
02:13:13.101 --> 02:13:17.090
you could trick them with fucking anything.
Three Card Monte,
you know,

2429
02:13:17.091 --> 02:13:18.710
you can get,
and if you scare them,

2430
02:13:18.711 --> 02:13:22.490
it's even better because that fear part of their brain will trigger and they

2431
02:13:22.491 --> 02:13:25.850
will,
everything will dovetail bottleneck through that air.
Next thing you know,

2432
02:13:25.851 --> 02:13:29.860
they're drinking beer,
watching fucking red dawn screaming wolverine right there.

2433
02:13:29.861 --> 02:13:32.160
Ready?
Yep.
What do you,
what do you think happened

2434
02:13:32.160 --> 02:13:35.670
<v 5>on nine 11?
What is your feeling?
I think,
well,
I think,
um,</v>

2435
02:13:36.120 --> 02:13:38.260
I'm a big believer in that.
Uh,
you know,
uh,

2436
02:13:38.340 --> 02:13:41.880
most of the time the official story is horse shit,
especially on big scale,

2437
02:13:41.881 --> 02:13:46.530
things like that.
I think,
um,
there's a good combination of Cya and intentional,

2438
02:13:46.650 --> 02:13:51.330
uh,
push that mixed at the right time.
And again,
Robert Anton Wilson said,
yeah,

2439
02:13:51.360 --> 02:13:55.200
there's uh,
um,
there are groups that run the world.
There's not more,

2440
02:13:55.230 --> 02:13:57.300
they're not just one group that runs the whole world.

2441
02:13:57.301 --> 02:14:01.020
There's several that are trying all the time and they fuck up like anybody else.

2442
02:14:01.021 --> 02:14:02.570
They have shit sons who do,

2443
02:14:02.640 --> 02:14:06.840
don't do their job right and ruin the family fortune for a decade and have to

2444
02:14:06.841 --> 02:14:07.320
come back.

2445
02:14:07.320 --> 02:14:11.670
So I don't believe in this perfect world order Bohemian Grove Bilderberg group

2446
02:14:11.671 --> 02:14:14.640
thing where they get everything they want and there's nothing we can do and
blah,

2447
02:14:14.641 --> 02:14:17.460
blah.
You know,
they're like,
that's where I buried from the Alex Jones kind of.

2448
02:14:17.630 --> 02:14:19.980
They're a perfect monster.
It doesn't work that way.

2449
02:14:20.040 --> 02:14:24.030
Everybody is fallible and I think in a lot of times they do know in the

2450
02:14:24.031 --> 02:14:27.780
Reichstag fire and those kinds of things,
false flag operations work very well.

2451
02:14:28.230 --> 02:14:33.230
Building one yourself is very difficult letting one happen when you know it's

2452
02:14:34.831 --> 02:14:36.570
already coming by looking the other way,

2453
02:14:36.571 --> 02:14:39.090
like some people argue with Pearl Harbor was we knew it was coming,

2454
02:14:39.091 --> 02:14:41.730
but we also knew that was the impetus to get in there.
And we had a bunch of,

2455
02:14:41.760 --> 02:14:45.450
you know,
um,
well we pulled out American warships.
Yeah.

2456
02:14:45.510 --> 02:14:47.710
We pulled out warships because we knew that it was going to be hit.

2457
02:14:47.711 --> 02:14:48.510
I mean the actual,

2458
02:14:48.510 --> 02:14:51.240
there was a history channel documentary that have aired recently that have

2459
02:14:51.241 --> 02:14:54.840
gotten as far as saying that we were aware of the attack and allowing it to

2460
02:14:54.841 --> 02:14:58.680
happen so that we'd be brought in the World War II.
Much like I think,
um,

2461
02:14:58.710 --> 02:15:03.540
comedy plus,
you know,
tragedy will or time plus tragedy equals comedy.
You know,

2462
02:15:03.541 --> 02:15:05.940
people can make comedy out of something and as long as it's far enough in the

2463
02:15:05.941 --> 02:15:06.271
distance,

2464
02:15:06.271 --> 02:15:09.690
I think a lot of us can also accept things the further there in the distance we

2465
02:15:09.691 --> 02:15:12.870
can war two or Gulf of Tonkin.
Exactly.
Once you go,
oh yeah,
well sure.

2466
02:15:12.871 --> 02:15:15.450
There was the right type of higher they the Gulf of Tonkin incident.
Yeah.
Yeah.

2467
02:15:15.451 --> 02:15:16.700
Pearl Harbor probably had some better.

2468
02:15:16.701 --> 02:15:19.920
We solicited but this just happened and we want to believe in our own.

2469
02:15:20.220 --> 02:15:23.900
We want to believe that the different time unfulfillable because we're,
this is,

2470
02:15:23.980 --> 02:15:26.850
those are,
those people are idiots.
We,
on the other hand,

2471
02:15:26.880 --> 02:15:31.200
I couldn't get food like that.
And I think,
um,
I think like,
like the,

2472
02:15:32.070 --> 02:15:32.903
like the recession,

2473
02:15:33.000 --> 02:15:37.560
I think the recession was something that could happen at any time because our

2474
02:15:37.740 --> 02:15:41.640
financial system in this country is a house of cards as it is in most countries

2475
02:15:41.641 --> 02:15:44.160
around the world.
It's based on what the Chinese called funk p,

2476
02:15:44.161 --> 02:15:48.060
which means fart air.
It's just,
it's,
it's smells and you know,
it's there,

2477
02:15:48.061 --> 02:15:51.180
but it has no substance at all.
It would not say you can't,
you know,

2478
02:15:51.181 --> 02:15:53.540
fart errors there,
but you can't rest or the economy.
Yeah.

2479
02:15:53.550 --> 02:15:56.990
But you can't rest your cup on it as it described the economy that way.
Yeah.

2480
02:15:57.000 --> 02:16:01.890
That's amazing.
And so the,
um,
we,
we know that at any given time you could,

2481
02:16:02.580 --> 02:16:04.860
you could crush this.
You could,
you could,
you could,

2482
02:16:04.890 --> 02:16:07.410
you could bring me down because it's not even based on gold anymore.

2483
02:16:07.570 --> 02:16:09.510
So even that,
even,

2484
02:16:09.540 --> 02:16:14.010
even money based on gold is a resource that people have to agree has worth.

2485
02:16:14.030 --> 02:16:18.090
Right.
Which is even,
I think,
ridiculous.
Less flexible than creativity.
Yeah.

2486
02:16:18.230 --> 02:16:20.310
You know,
I know what you're worth as a human being.

2487
02:16:20.610 --> 02:16:23.730
I can't eat gold once I need it.
But I know you guys can figure out how to farm.

2488
02:16:23.760 --> 02:16:23.910
Well,

2489
02:16:23.910 --> 02:16:27.690
the really crazy thing about gold is the Zechariah Hitch and definition of why

2490
02:16:27.691 --> 02:16:30.000
we are tell us,
cause we were monkey.
We were told that we

2491
02:16:30.000 --> 02:16:32.050
<v 2>are genetically programmed to dig it up.
Yeah.</v>

2492
02:16:32.051 --> 02:16:34.690
Well that's along with diamonds and other shit cold.
No.

2493
02:16:34.730 --> 02:16:38.620
The reason we'd go for gold is he,
he wrote this in the 12th planet,

2494
02:16:38.621 --> 02:16:40.810
his book that came out in the 1970s.
Yeah.

2495
02:16:40.930 --> 02:16:44.890
That the ancient Sumerians when they were uh,

2496
02:16:44.891 --> 02:16:47.200
were being raised by the Annunaki,

2497
02:16:47.201 --> 02:16:50.020
the ideas of the Annunaki came from this other planet,
these aliens,

2498
02:16:50.021 --> 02:16:54.490
and they interdicted their DNA into human DNA to teach them to mined for gold.

2499
02:16:54.850 --> 02:16:58.450
And the reason why they want him to mine for gold as they needed to suspend gold

2500
02:16:58.451 --> 02:17:01.630
particles in their atmosphere to protect themselves because they,

2501
02:17:01.780 --> 02:17:04.960
in their quest for technology,
much like us,
they destroyed their environment.

2502
02:17:04.990 --> 02:17:09.130
Right.
And that,
that and that they needed it puffed around here temporarily,

2503
02:17:09.131 --> 02:17:13.240
like an and part of a particular farm,
which that's conductivity makes sense.

2504
02:17:13.241 --> 02:17:16.040
Yeah.
Well they didn't figure that out until like 2000.

2505
02:17:16.070 --> 02:17:20.020
It was like they had some sort of a symposium on climate change and they were

2506
02:17:20.021 --> 02:17:23.530
trying to figure out ways to protect us if we lost,
you know,

2507
02:17:23.531 --> 02:17:25.120
a good percentage percentage of our environment.

2508
02:17:25.121 --> 02:17:29.110
And one of the ways was to suspend gold dust or reflective particles in the

2509
02:17:29.111 --> 02:17:32.860
atmosphere to reflect.
The other thing is paint your fucking roof white.
If every,

2510
02:17:33.070 --> 02:17:37.000
if every house in America had a white roof instead of a black roof,

2511
02:17:37.120 --> 02:17:41.350
it would reflect as much light as the,
uh,
as the polar ice caps would.

2512
02:17:41.680 --> 02:17:44.170
And what would that do for us?
It would,
it would reflect the heat.

2513
02:17:44.230 --> 02:17:45.760
I mean that's really,
ultimately the ice does,

2514
02:17:45.761 --> 02:17:48.040
it doesn't specifically cool the planet in that regard.

2515
02:17:48.041 --> 02:17:52.270
It reflects the light back instead of absorbing it and the absorptive he wants,

2516
02:17:52.271 --> 02:17:56.440
the ice is gone.
The darkness of the rocket stuff pulls the,
the heat in,

2517
02:17:56.620 --> 02:18:01.030
whereas the sunlight reflects it back.
Um,
you know,
the white reflects it back.

2518
02:18:01.031 --> 02:18:01.960
So one of the big,

2519
02:18:02.020 --> 02:18:05.860
like a green tech things that they're trying to push is white roofs or light

2520
02:18:05.861 --> 02:18:08.410
colored roofs.
Huh.
But what about solar?
Well,

2521
02:18:08.411 --> 02:18:13.240
solar absorbs but and uses it for another source.
But in so far as rooftops,

2522
02:18:13.300 --> 02:18:16.300
you know,
that aren't being used for that,
like sand does the same thing.

2523
02:18:16.360 --> 02:18:18.460
It's why you would have to make a choice.
Yeah.

2524
02:18:18.850 --> 02:18:21.470
Well not necessarily you environment or free electric.

2525
02:18:21.471 --> 02:18:24.430
You get as much as you'd want and then you did every other portion would be

2526
02:18:24.431 --> 02:18:24.731
white.

2527
02:18:24.731 --> 02:18:28.810
Eventually we will have reflective solar panels will have inter like the light

2528
02:18:28.811 --> 02:18:31.120
bounces off the black silicone and,
and then go,

2529
02:18:31.150 --> 02:18:36.020
which is a relatively new molecule that we're using.
Uh,

2530
02:18:36.090 --> 02:18:39.070
well I say we,
but you know,
human beings will be used,

2531
02:18:39.080 --> 02:18:43.930
stand up comics totally come up with new films.
The inside of it will be,

2532
02:18:43.990 --> 02:18:47.140
we'll bounce the white back into it and then it'll look white to the outside

2533
02:18:47.141 --> 02:18:49.720
viewer.
But certain UV we'll get through the first one to get off the grid.

2534
02:18:49.870 --> 02:18:50.681
I really need to do it.

2535
02:18:50.681 --> 02:18:53.300
It's one of the reasons why I moved to Colorado for a bit to,
you know,

2536
02:18:53.340 --> 02:18:55.540
get the grid dude,
you could totally do it here.
You get enough sunlight,

2537
02:18:55.550 --> 02:19:00.190
your appearance.
Yeah,
yeah.
Work like a charm.
But,
but in so far as,
uh,
you know,

2538
02:19:00.320 --> 02:19:04.750
the,
the concept of ever getting back to kind of nine,
11 and the idea of was it,

2539
02:19:05.440 --> 02:19:08.950
um,
you know,
manufactured or was it,
you know,
what,
we're attacked or whatever.

2540
02:19:08.980 --> 02:19:09.570
I think there's,

2541
02:19:09.570 --> 02:19:13.210
there's a case for both at the same time they operate that there are people in

2542
02:19:13.211 --> 02:19:16.750
the government who saw opportunity in letting one slide through and maybe they

2543
02:19:16.751 --> 02:19:18.190
didn't realize how big it would be.

2544
02:19:18.400 --> 02:19:20.830
Maybe they didn't realize that it would be as big as nine 11,

2545
02:19:20.831 --> 02:19:22.160
that it would be maybe another.
Yeah.

2546
02:19:22.170 --> 02:19:24.490
But if they were going to let plain slamming the idea,

2547
02:19:24.520 --> 02:19:28.580
that's what I mean is NATO stood down and let this happen.
The,
they had been,

2548
02:19:28.640 --> 02:19:31.700
they had been warned about people hijacking planes,

2549
02:19:31.701 --> 02:19:33.830
the slamming of the buildings in advanced.
I agree.

2550
02:19:33.831 --> 02:19:38.180
But maybe they thought they could.
Uh,
maybe again,
maybe to control,
be complicit.

2551
02:19:38.210 --> 02:19:41.030
How many people have to be complicit is just a small number and everyone else

2552
02:19:41.031 --> 02:19:41.930
just follows orders.

2553
02:19:41.960 --> 02:19:44.300
It's a small number and everybody else has to think they're falling to write

2554
02:19:44.301 --> 02:19:46.010
orders and there's not compartmentalize.

2555
02:19:46.130 --> 02:19:47.720
It's like the arguments against chem trails.

2556
02:19:47.990 --> 02:19:50.810
If you look at chem trails and you go,
okay,
maybe here's what,

2557
02:19:50.870 --> 02:19:53.150
here's what you have to do.
Here's your tough decision.
You're in government.

2558
02:19:53.720 --> 02:19:56.570
Somebody comes to you and goes,
look,
there's unequivocable signs.

2559
02:19:56.780 --> 02:20:00.410
We're fucking up the atmosphere and if we don't start having more reflective

2560
02:20:00.440 --> 02:20:03.680
clouds in the sky,
we're dead,
especially over big cities.

2561
02:20:03.890 --> 02:20:06.530
So what we're going to start doing is we're going to start seeding the clouds

2562
02:20:06.531 --> 02:20:11.000
with barium and aluminum and we're going to bring back the cloud cover over our

2563
02:20:11.001 --> 02:20:11.810
major cities.

2564
02:20:11.810 --> 02:20:14.570
So we bounced back some of the pollution and we bounced back the light the other

2565
02:20:14.571 --> 02:20:16.280
direction,
and we have to do this.

2566
02:20:16.310 --> 02:20:20.450
Otherwise 40% of the American populace will die.
Why not tell people about this?

2567
02:20:20.480 --> 02:20:25.010
Because by doing it,
12% are going to die.

2568
02:20:25.011 --> 02:20:27.890
Barium and aluminum will kill a certain number of the weak among us.

2569
02:20:27.891 --> 02:20:30.680
Let's say this is a bad,
so you believe that all those things in the sky,

2570
02:20:30.681 --> 02:20:33.220
those lines are all,
no,
I'm just saying I'm using a sentence.

2571
02:20:33.440 --> 02:20:36.050
Do you believe that though?
What do you believe?
Well that's the thing is I,

2572
02:20:36.051 --> 02:20:37.880
I do think there's,
whether manipulation going on and people,

2573
02:20:37.890 --> 02:20:41.630
this is definitely what I'm going to be like been more,
it's been documented.

2574
02:20:41.631 --> 02:20:45.590
It is,
you know,
in,
in Georgia if there's certain forms you have to fill out,

2575
02:20:45.591 --> 02:20:48.470
you know,
and yeah,
I forget what the exact subject is,

2576
02:20:48.710 --> 02:20:51.170
but it's a government form and one of the things has to deal with weather

2577
02:20:51.171 --> 02:20:53.630
manipulation.
So it's a standard.
Totally.
I mean we have,

2578
02:20:53.631 --> 02:20:55.460
we've already shown that it can be done totally.

2579
02:20:55.461 --> 02:20:58.280
In the 70s the government decided we were going to be on the cutting edge of it

2580
02:20:58.340 --> 02:21:00.470
in American government decided we were going to be on the cutting edge of it.

2581
02:21:00.471 --> 02:21:03.170
And by the way,
at that same moment,
the Chinese went,
Oh yes,
too.

2582
02:21:03.410 --> 02:21:07.280
And just immediately started leapfrogging ahead of us in the technology.

2583
02:21:07.580 --> 02:21:11.170
But the point is,
the nine 11 part comes in,
you've got,

2584
02:21:11.640 --> 02:21:12.860
you've got these planes flying over,

2585
02:21:12.861 --> 02:21:16.010
you got soldiers going up every day and they know they're dropping Berryman

2586
02:21:16.011 --> 02:21:18.890
aluminum into the atmosphere and they know it's a bit of a secret thing and they

2587
02:21:18.891 --> 02:21:21.350
know it's for the betterment of man.
[inaudible]
information though.

2588
02:21:21.351 --> 02:21:23.410
How do you know,
I'm just,
I'm using these as examples,

2589
02:21:23.411 --> 02:21:27.290
whether it's a true ab is amazing.
Maybe as a maybe theory.
Yeah.

2590
02:21:27.291 --> 02:21:30.890
This is where the nine 11 part kind of that,
where it kind of,
there's parody in,

2591
02:21:30.930 --> 02:21:35.420
in the argument whether or not it was an external or an internal threat or who

2592
02:21:35.421 --> 02:21:38.360
needed to stand down,
who needed to be,
um,
on the game,

2593
02:21:38.420 --> 02:21:40.280
in the game and outside the game.
Okay.

2594
02:21:40.281 --> 02:21:42.740
So you've got every day you've got soldiers,
you come up to him and go,
look,

2595
02:21:42.860 --> 02:21:45.380
we have this new plan.
It's necessary to save.

2596
02:21:45.410 --> 02:21:47.180
Lots of lives are going to fix the atmosphere.

2597
02:21:47.181 --> 02:21:49.700
It's when you guys are on the prowl,
the soldiers this,
well,
no,

2598
02:21:49.701 --> 02:21:50.740
you've got this front line thing.

2599
02:21:50.770 --> 02:21:53.690
Well cause you're not dumping shit behind your plane.

2600
02:21:53.691 --> 02:21:55.790
You're not going to do it everyday without some sort of an answer.

2601
02:21:55.970 --> 02:21:57.110
So they're going to go to you,
look,

2602
02:21:57.111 --> 02:21:59.300
this is what we're doing and you're going to notice the difference everyday

2603
02:21:59.320 --> 02:22:01.730
you're going to drive home from your job at the base and you're gonna look up,

2604
02:22:01.760 --> 02:22:03.830
there's gonna be cloud cover that wasn't there before and they're,

2605
02:22:03.860 --> 02:22:06.410
and you're a part of that mission.
It's very important part of that mission.

2606
02:22:06.411 --> 02:22:09.170
And you guys are how,
how has this not yet out though?

2607
02:22:09.470 --> 02:22:10.790
Don't you think this would get out though?

2608
02:22:10.800 --> 02:22:12.310
You think there'd be some dude that would be,

2609
02:22:12.320 --> 02:22:14.870
his fucking voice would be altered on some television show.

2610
02:22:14.871 --> 02:22:17.990
I think there are guys like me that what I was doing was going to save the

2611
02:22:17.991 --> 02:22:20.150
environment,
but I think it'd be,
well that's,

2612
02:22:20.210 --> 02:22:23.000
I think they pick their guys very well.
Yeah.
And you know,

2613
02:22:23.001 --> 02:22:25.190
so how often do you think this is happening?
That they're spraying shit in the,

2614
02:22:25.300 --> 02:22:26.320
in the sky?
Why?

2615
02:22:26.400 --> 02:22:29.640
I mean if you look at the criss cross patterns in the air over Los Angeles meet

2616
02:22:29.790 --> 02:22:30.623
three times a week.

2617
02:22:31.440 --> 02:22:35.690
Do you know though that that's been proven that turbine engines interact rate

2618
02:22:35.691 --> 02:22:37.590
costume in the APP?
I'm not even arguing.
No,
no,
no.

2619
02:22:37.591 --> 02:22:39.870
I'm not arguing whether or not to actually treat clouds.

2620
02:22:40.200 --> 02:22:44.590
I mean it actually the moisture and when it gets spun [inaudible] in chemtrails

2621
02:22:44.610 --> 02:22:45.680
down is not true,

2622
02:22:46.230 --> 02:22:49.530
but it's dependent scientifically dependent on the amount of moisture that's in

2623
02:22:49.531 --> 02:22:50.280
the air.

2624
02:22:50.280 --> 02:22:53.310
I think that you prove that moisture and make it do certain things and that's

2625
02:22:53.311 --> 02:22:56.240
what whether manipulation,
right?
But these planes,
I'm not even numb.

2626
02:22:56.241 --> 02:22:57.510
Not Assuming whether it's valid or not.

2627
02:22:57.780 --> 02:23:01.380
Leaving these trails is so substantial that you're,
you're,

2628
02:23:01.381 --> 02:23:04.320
you're including commercial Aircrafts and I'm knocking around because you would

2629
02:23:04.321 --> 02:23:07.020
never criss cross commercial aircraft in the air and the atmosphere,

2630
02:23:07.021 --> 02:23:11.280
you would never create perpendicular lines in the same atmospheric level with

2631
02:23:11.550 --> 02:23:15.600
commercial planes.
And by the way,
near cities they don't fly at that height.
They,

2632
02:23:15.610 --> 02:23:17.660
the,
the,
the trails that you're seeing that are,

2633
02:23:17.661 --> 02:23:20.370
that are effectively what would be called chem trails are,

2634
02:23:20.580 --> 02:23:24.990
are higher than planes fly when they enter Los Angeles atmosphere to land or

2635
02:23:24.991 --> 02:23:27.240
take off and they do not reach those outs.

2636
02:23:27.241 --> 02:23:31.620
Dudes until they are well outside that area when you sitting criss cross.
Okay.

2637
02:23:31.710 --> 02:23:35.460
And a checkerboard pattern flight patterns of you really studied this,

2638
02:23:35.461 --> 02:23:40.060
you would never happened ever criss cross planes in the air at that Alto.

2639
02:23:40.061 --> 02:23:44.280
Why don't you,
when people are coming from,
do you all get the same way?
No,

2640
02:23:44.310 --> 02:23:45.510
they all bank around.

2641
02:23:45.511 --> 02:23:49.620
They go in circular format like this but they and and on two levels and that's

2642
02:23:49.621 --> 02:23:53.250
why you have east and West or north and south landing strips.

2643
02:23:53.460 --> 02:23:58.290
That's why you circled people around in a specific pattern trough seems to be

2644
02:23:58.291 --> 02:24:01.890
something that should be discussed.
Like why isn't that in Bourbon?

2645
02:24:02.020 --> 02:24:05.220
Lax Burbank has to go that way.
It can circle around that much.

2646
02:24:05.221 --> 02:24:09.410
It's not that far away.
You know that,
that those Burbank airports.
Yeah.

2647
02:24:09.411 --> 02:24:12.530
And then you have John Wayne and the Orange County's coming up this degree.

2648
02:24:12.600 --> 02:24:15.120
There's only so much so that they get in and Gulf streams like a road and they

2649
02:24:15.121 --> 02:24:17.070
have and they have uh,

2650
02:24:17.190 --> 02:24:21.060
they have like what would be like sort of Col-de-sac he looking turns that the

2651
02:24:21.061 --> 02:24:22.260
planes go through and you've been in them,

2652
02:24:22.440 --> 02:24:25.020
you've been in holding patterns that go around and they're circular and they go

2653
02:24:25.021 --> 02:24:27.510
back around to specific landing strip but they never,

2654
02:24:27.511 --> 02:24:32.511
criss cross is never a point where the bang really do a real audit of the actual

2655
02:24:32.851 --> 02:24:36.690
patterns over La.
This is a look at them.
Tough.
Yeah,
but you can't just say that.

2656
02:24:36.691 --> 02:24:39.780
I think how,
I mean on what the online you can actually see the airplane.
Yeah.

2657
02:24:39.781 --> 02:24:42.900
But blind patterns,
but you can see where they're supposed to go.

2658
02:24:42.901 --> 02:24:44.910
Exactly where they do go,
where they do go.

2659
02:24:45.120 --> 02:24:48.060
What about cargo planes and a bunch of other different kinds of things as well.

2660
02:24:48.090 --> 02:24:51.630
They all use the same path point.
Technically they should.
Yeah,
because you don't,

2661
02:24:51.631 --> 02:24:54.330
you would never,
you would never have a plain criss cross.
Another.

2662
02:24:54.360 --> 02:24:56.550
The point is I'm not arguing for or against chem trails.

2663
02:24:56.551 --> 02:24:59.340
I'm using it as an example.
Okay.
I'm using this example.

2664
02:24:59.341 --> 02:25:02.250
Let's say that based on a hypothesis,

2665
02:25:02.610 --> 02:25:05.940
you have soldiers who are told every day you're doing something to help the

2666
02:25:05.941 --> 02:25:10.330
environment and you're flying up every day and you're dropping a this barium in

2667
02:25:10.331 --> 02:25:13.260
aluminum into the atmosphere because this helps us create cloud cover and this

2668
02:25:13.261 --> 02:25:16.800
is the whole point.
And you go,
okay,
good.
All right,
as a soldier I'm onboard.

2669
02:25:17.100 --> 02:25:21.780
That's great.
And then one day somebody switches the canisters doesn't tell you,

2670
02:25:22.380 --> 02:25:24.250
didn't tell anybody else and you dump

2671
02:25:24.400 --> 02:25:29.400
<v 5>pesticide or a poison or lithium on the public lithium and you don't and you</v>

2672
02:25:29.651 --> 02:25:31.000
don't,
I'm not saying this happens,

2673
02:25:31.001 --> 02:25:36.001
I'm just saying that's where the conspiracy doesn't have to involve you at all.

2674
02:25:36.700 --> 02:25:39.820
You will do exactly what you're told because you've been doing something that

2675
02:25:39.821 --> 02:25:40.930
you perceive as good,

2676
02:25:41.480 --> 02:25:46.480
like every plane that went north to do a war game to practice against Russia as

2677
02:25:46.991 --> 02:25:49.180
if it was necessary.
None of those guys were bad guys.

2678
02:25:49.570 --> 02:25:52.240
They were just following the order that was given them and that eventually that

2679
02:25:52.241 --> 02:25:55.540
gets to a smaller and smaller portion of the group that are on a need to know

2680
02:25:55.541 --> 02:25:57.370
basis.
And they just kind of offer orders and we're going,

2681
02:25:57.520 --> 02:26:00.370
this is the day we're going to do a big NATO exercise.
Okay,
what's,

2682
02:26:00.400 --> 02:26:03.070
how's this different from any other day?
We do a big NATO exercise.

2683
02:26:03.370 --> 02:26:06.460
Well and this one other shit is happening,
but you're not privy to that point.

2684
02:26:06.470 --> 02:26:07.390
You're still a good guy.

2685
02:26:07.720 --> 02:26:11.560
That's why there's so many good guys can be involved in something nefarious

2686
02:26:11.710 --> 02:26:14.340
without them actually being involved in it.
You know,

2687
02:26:14.360 --> 02:26:17.110
specifically they don't have any inclination or any information.

2688
02:26:17.320 --> 02:26:20.710
And that's where people's fears,
I think of chem trails come from is the idea,

2689
02:26:20.711 --> 02:26:23.530
you know,
whether it's true or not is that they're afraid someday.

2690
02:26:23.830 --> 02:26:27.900
Dick Cheney and his buddies have CECI.
Yeah,
we'll decide to switch

2691
02:26:28.360 --> 02:26:29.230
<v 3>barrels.
You know,</v>

2692
02:26:29.231 --> 02:26:32.140
and people think that this is completely outside the realm of possibility and

2693
02:26:32.141 --> 02:26:34.540
absolutely Wacko Nis,
and you're talking crazy.

2694
02:26:34.541 --> 02:26:38.470
But operation Northwoods is the one thing that always rings in my head.

2695
02:26:38.471 --> 02:26:41.440
And if you're not aware of it,
go read about it online because it was a,

2696
02:26:41.441 --> 02:26:46.441
it was a document that was drafted by the Joint Chiefs of staff signed by the

2697
02:26:46.600 --> 02:26:46.630
Joint Chiefs of Staff.

2698
02:26:46.630 --> 02:26:49.750
So they were down with this proposal and it was vetoed ultimately,

2699
02:26:49.920 --> 02:26:53.590
and it was in 1962 and the idea was that they were going to attack American

2700
02:26:53.591 --> 02:26:56.080
civilians,
they were going to attack Guantanamo Bay,

2701
02:26:56.081 --> 02:26:59.830
they were going to blow up jetliners and saving their way to Cuba and they were

2702
02:26:59.831 --> 02:27:02.530
going to blame it on Cuba and we were going to go to war with Cuba.
Get this.

2703
02:27:02.620 --> 02:27:03.850
Exactly.
It's amazing

2704
02:27:04.370 --> 02:27:07.730
<v 5>guys.
A lot of those guys,
by the way,
still work in the military.
Absolutely.</v>

2705
02:27:08.030 --> 02:27:10.300
By the way,
risen in rank since

2706
02:27:10.340 --> 02:27:13.450
<v 3>then and by the way were never arrested.
And by the way,</v>

2707
02:27:13.630 --> 02:27:18.520
everything where you don't have a massive fucking calling of all these corrupt

2708
02:27:18.521 --> 02:27:19.390
people in government,

2709
02:27:19.750 --> 02:27:23.860
everything evolves include including corruption and if corruption existed in the

2710
02:27:23.861 --> 02:27:27.760
18 hundreds it's still around today and if it existed in 1962 and no one went to

2711
02:27:27.761 --> 02:27:31.420
jail for it,
well words,
where's the track?
The lineage.
Zach who hired who?

2712
02:27:31.450 --> 02:27:35.080
So what does people hired the next generation and they train them and then it's

2713
02:27:35.081 --> 02:27:36.010
all the same thing.
Then

2714
02:27:36.070 --> 02:27:37.720
<v 5>the chem trails argument is,
or what?</v>

2715
02:27:37.721 --> 02:27:40.960
I'm basically using it as an example of how you could create a nine 11 kind of

2716
02:27:40.990 --> 02:27:45.700
circumstance.
Almost any level.
Just good people all and they don't even know.

2717
02:27:45.730 --> 02:27:48.220
I don't even aren't even aware of it because they're doing something that they

2718
02:27:48.221 --> 02:27:51.430
think is helping.
You know what I mean?
Let's say,
I don't

2719
02:27:51.430 --> 02:27:53.230
<v 3>know if I agree with you about the chem trails thing.</v>

2720
02:27:53.231 --> 02:27:56.110
I think I need to look into it and find out what the deal is with the weather

2721
02:27:56.111 --> 02:27:58.270
patterns and I just don't know how it could be so prevalent.

2722
02:27:58.540 --> 02:28:01.960
It just seems silly to me.
It seems like you would have too much fluid.

2723
02:28:02.020 --> 02:28:03.280
You'd have too many,
you know,

2724
02:28:03.281 --> 02:28:06.100
it'd be too obvious to many people would be talking about it to me again,

2725
02:28:06.101 --> 02:28:08.800
I have no,
I wouldn't do it during the day.
I have no,
why would they?

2726
02:28:08.860 --> 02:28:11.310
Why wouldn't they do it?
And they'll do it at night.
While the idea is,
hey,

2727
02:28:11.860 --> 02:28:15.700
maybe clouds only lasts a certain amount of time or you need to do it during

2728
02:28:15.760 --> 02:28:16.511
sunlight hours.

2729
02:28:16.511 --> 02:28:18.940
But the point is the way I agree with you that it's possible that it could

2730
02:28:18.941 --> 02:28:22.220
happen and I have no dog in that race all I'm just,
I was using

2731
02:28:22.220 --> 02:28:25.760
<v 5>it as a pure example of where you could get soldiers as a,</v>

2732
02:28:25.850 --> 02:28:29.750
as a direct example to do exactly what they're told in a positive sense on a

2733
02:28:29.751 --> 02:28:33.530
secret level where they know they shouldn't tell anybody because they know sort

2734
02:28:33.531 --> 02:28:36.380
of consequentially that they're doing something good but not everybody would get

2735
02:28:36.381 --> 02:28:39.260
it.
And it's a level of secret that's actually important.

2736
02:28:39.261 --> 02:28:42.710
And then flip the game where it could be something very negative.

2737
02:28:42.830 --> 02:28:46.250
Do you ever feel frustrated that when you talk about any of these weird subjects

2738
02:28:46.251 --> 02:28:49.840
that you get labeled as like a nut,
you get labeled as like a loose thinker,

2739
02:28:49.850 --> 02:28:52.670
a Wacko.
Cause if you start talking about like tower seven,

2740
02:28:52.671 --> 02:28:55.430
what happened with towers having,
right,
you're a,
you're a loon man,

2741
02:28:55.431 --> 02:28:59.210
you get boxed into this category of conspiracy theorist,

2742
02:28:59.480 --> 02:29:02.780
which automatically makes it very easy to dismiss you.

2743
02:29:02.840 --> 02:29:04.760
But I also think that as a comedian,

2744
02:29:04.940 --> 02:29:08.330
I think it's our job to not give a shit what other people think and say stuff

2745
02:29:08.331 --> 02:29:12.170
that other people don't feel the freedom to say whether or not we get rid of and

2746
02:29:12.171 --> 02:29:15.710
laughed at or with is almost immaterial.

2747
02:29:15.830 --> 02:29:19.910
And I think we owe it to ourselves as comedians specifically is the philosophy

2748
02:29:19.911 --> 02:29:23.150
that goes with comedy to take,
uh,
you know,
uh,
you know,

2749
02:29:23.180 --> 02:29:25.190
to cut angles as you'd say in Jujitsu to go,

2750
02:29:25.220 --> 02:29:27.980
instead of taking a force directly on,
let me look at it from this angle,

2751
02:29:27.981 --> 02:29:31.010
this angle,
this angle and this angle.
Whereas other people only have the,

2752
02:29:31.070 --> 02:29:33.710
they'll only look at the tiger by its teeth and its nose.

2753
02:29:34.280 --> 02:29:36.440
And know that it's scary and know that they don't want to fuck with it.

2754
02:29:36.500 --> 02:29:40.370
I think one thing that comics or any public speaker that you know has an

2755
02:29:40.371 --> 02:29:44.330
interesting point of view does is they offer a different path for the person to

2756
02:29:44.331 --> 02:29:47.570
start thinking.
Right?
Then other people will listen to you and say,
you know what?

2757
02:29:47.571 --> 02:29:50.240
This house parks guys making a lot of fucking sense.
You know,

2758
02:29:50.241 --> 02:29:52.220
like maybe I'm not a hundred percent agreeing with him,

2759
02:29:52.221 --> 02:29:54.350
but I see that this guy has really thought this out.

2760
02:29:54.630 --> 02:29:58.850
Maybe I should consider his his ideas and maybe it's not even about this.
Maybe,

2761
02:29:58.880 --> 02:30:01.820
maybe you're not looking at nine 11 you couldn't give a rat's ass whether it was

2762
02:30:01.910 --> 02:30:02.721
fake or real,

2763
02:30:02.721 --> 02:30:06.590
whether it was staged or an actual attack and it has no real bearing on your

2764
02:30:06.591 --> 02:30:07.640
life personally.

2765
02:30:07.730 --> 02:30:12.730
But you might come in touch with a situation in your own social circle or in

2766
02:30:13.251 --> 02:30:14.390
your job where you're like,

2767
02:30:14.630 --> 02:30:18.020
this sounds like bullshit to me and you might be more apt to look a little

2768
02:30:18.021 --> 02:30:21.740
deeper and at the sides of it then you would have beforehand if you just get

2769
02:30:21.741 --> 02:30:23.970
used to the idea of a toe,
the line,
you know right here,

2770
02:30:23.990 --> 02:30:26.750
the official story nine 11 on forward are the official story.
Pearl Harbor.

2771
02:30:26.751 --> 02:30:29.600
I'm for it.
I hear the official story of how Jesus was born,
lived and died.

2772
02:30:29.601 --> 02:30:31.660
I'm for it.
And then you don't ever,

2773
02:30:31.690 --> 02:30:36.140
then you come up against something that doesn't fit and you're willing to step

2774
02:30:36.141 --> 02:30:39.800
back and look at it objectively and say,
this doesn't jive with my conscious.

2775
02:30:39.800 --> 02:30:43.340
Actually you have the skill built through critical thinking to look at.

2776
02:30:43.341 --> 02:30:45.890
And again,
you could,
you could do all the thinking about building seven.

2777
02:30:45.891 --> 02:30:47.930
You can do all the thinking about,
you know,

2778
02:30:47.931 --> 02:30:50.630
whether or not they wanted the TSA situation set up and all that kind of

2779
02:30:50.631 --> 02:30:54.800
bullshit,
um,
beforehand or the,
you know,
like the,

2780
02:30:55.220 --> 02:30:58.100
like the Conservatives groups had this,
you know,

2781
02:30:58.101 --> 02:31:01.400
build a Burg idea that they're going to craft human consciousness and put

2782
02:31:01.401 --> 02:31:04.490
lithium in the water and all that.
Alex Jones Shit.
You can believe that stuff.

2783
02:31:04.640 --> 02:31:07.580
You can explore it without going there and staying there.

2784
02:31:07.581 --> 02:31:12.581
And the same way that you can sort of arguably take DMT and not stay in that

2785
02:31:13.941 --> 02:31:18.530
brain stem position you can get trapped into the world was conspiracy.

2786
02:31:18.531 --> 02:31:20.040
You can get trapped.
Right.
And it's not

2787
02:31:20.040 --> 02:31:22.710
<v 3>necessary.
The whole point is be aware,</v>

2788
02:31:22.970 --> 02:31:25.770
be aware and don't just buy the straight line.
You know,

2789
02:31:25.771 --> 02:31:30.300
like one of my wiki leaks.
Yeah,
that's right.
I said,
you know,

2790
02:31:30.330 --> 02:31:34.080
I fucking conversation.
Go on forever.
House Pie.
No,
but it's over.
I know.

2791
02:31:34.081 --> 02:31:36.000
It's crazy.
Let's,
let's end it now.
Yeah.

2792
02:31:36.030 --> 02:31:40.260
Two hours and 40 minutes and we're just starting three hours.
I tunes crashes.

2793
02:31:40.290 --> 02:31:44.700
It does well,
bits out podcasts,
you stream you verbose cunts.
Yeah.

2794
02:31:44.760 --> 02:31:47.010
As you stream still on the air,
you stream,
you can't only,

2795
02:31:47.070 --> 02:31:51.000
it can only do three hours.
Yeah.
Record.
It can be blatant forever.

2796
02:31:51.030 --> 02:31:55.450
But we've done that a few times.
Yeah.
Props to house barks.
Thank you very much.

2797
02:31:55.470 --> 02:31:58.350
Surfing come in on the conversation.
Really.
Absolutely.
Awesome.

2798
02:31:58.351 --> 02:32:02.580
Good intelligent conversation with Mr. House barks.
You go out on Twitter.

2799
02:32:02.730 --> 02:32:06.720
How sparks,
that's his Twitter name and his website is,

2800
02:32:06.780 --> 02:32:10.650
is it helps parks.com.
How's parks.com and his band is zero.

2801
02:32:10.651 --> 02:32:14.070
The letter zero dash one.
And where's your band playing next?
Um,

2802
02:32:14.130 --> 02:32:16.620
where I think we're at the Brixton in February.

2803
02:32:16.650 --> 02:32:20.340
The Brixton was that her most of beach powerful Hermosa beach and then only

2804
02:32:20.341 --> 02:32:23.360
magic club in the house.
Love that place.
Right.
And then I think we're doing um,

2805
02:32:23.400 --> 02:32:27.280
like a shuttle with like Lacey whiskey or key club in February as well.

2806
02:32:27.320 --> 02:32:30.450
It's the whiskey.
There's lots of bitches were going to San Francisco,

2807
02:32:30.480 --> 02:32:34.200
tear and bad dads.
San Francisco.
Okay,
cool.

2808
02:32:34.201 --> 02:32:36.430
And they could find all this stuff on your website.
Yeah.
Yeah.
We'll,

2809
02:32:36.431 --> 02:32:38.760
we'll be posting dates and like the next month because we're booking them all

2810
02:32:38.761 --> 02:32:40.800
now.
Nice.
Nice.
And Ladies and gentleman,

2811
02:32:40.801 --> 02:32:43.380
if you haven't seen the video that Brian made from Austin,

2812
02:32:43.550 --> 02:32:47.520
it is his piece did as his stalls.
It is his,
it's fucking brilliant.

2813
02:32:47.521 --> 02:32:49.590
It's the perfect length.
It leaves you wanting more.

2814
02:32:49.591 --> 02:32:50.580
I told him it should be longer,

2815
02:32:50.581 --> 02:32:54.930
but he's right because really it just leaves you just so,
so,
so good.

2816
02:32:55.170 --> 02:32:58.350
I watched it five times in a row,
man.
Fucking amazing.
I love watches.

2817
02:32:58.380 --> 02:33:01.050
Best editing ever and it's great and it's important.
You know that girl,

2818
02:33:01.180 --> 02:33:06.030
a Deb who was like,
I hate that song.
That Australian,
she lost her dog,
man.

2819
02:33:06.031 --> 02:33:10.200
Her dog disappear,
but she found it.
She found it.
Yeah.
So it was on Twitter.
Devo.

2820
02:33:10.590 --> 02:33:15.510
Awesome.
Everybody say congrats.
Devo Keefe right on Deb.
Oh k good on Ya.

2821
02:33:15.590 --> 02:33:19.410
He up that ground.
Fair.
Dinkum debow Keefe is a,
a radio DJ in Austin.

2822
02:33:19.411 --> 02:33:20.071
She's very cool.

2823
02:33:20.071 --> 02:33:23.010
And I was sad that she loves her dog and sad that she lost her dog for a bit.

2824
02:33:23.011 --> 02:33:26.280
But you've got to back.
It doesn't matter.
Bitches.
Props to the fleshlight.

2825
02:33:26.280 --> 02:33:29.580
Thank you very much for sponsoring our broadcast.
Um,

I get behind it.

2826
02:33:29.581 --> 02:33:32.130
It's a tool.
I have used it.
I use it on a regular basis.

2827
02:33:32.131 --> 02:33:35.310
It's awesome for shooting loads into it's way better than just masturbating.

2828
02:33:35.311 --> 02:33:38.760

Ari Shaffir and me.
Full death squad.

2832
02:33:50.970 --> 02:33:52.890
Perhaps Brian Red band will make an appearance.

2833
02:33:52.891 --> 02:33:56.160
Do you think you're up for going on stage and put of 2000 fucking people in

2834
02:33:56.161 --> 02:34:00.090
Vegas?
Okay.
Panic sets in.
I'm going to get him super,

super high and then force them on stage and it's got too high last night.

2836
02:34:03.451 --> 02:34:07.140
I'm going on stage you high and get her under.
We'll have a boner on stage.

2837
02:34:07.290 --> 02:34:10.670
I don't want that dude.
Wait,
we're having the UFC podcast tomorrow.
Oh yeah,

Okay.

2839

Tripoli,
n Joey fucking Diaz,

2842
02:34:25.870 --> 02:34:29.650
you've gotta be doing commentary on the fight so you can watch alongside.

2843
02:34:29.800 --> 02:34:30.490
Joey's going to,

2844
02:34:30.490 --> 02:34:33.250
they're going to be smoking pot and just talking shit about the fights as it

2845
02:34:33.251 --> 02:34:37.060
goes down.
This shit is going to be epic.
I,
I would,
I really,
I'm going to,

2846
02:34:37.061 --> 02:34:39.700
I'm looking forward to that night after the fights are over,

2847
02:34:39.710 --> 02:34:42.910
going back to my hotel room and watching this before I get up in the morning.

2848
02:34:42.911 --> 02:34:44.580
I just made it a lot more people to it too.

2849
02:34:44.800 --> 02:34:48.820
It's just going to be a crazy amount of people.
A Ra.
She fears coming.

2850
02:34:49.020 --> 02:34:53.410
Danielle Stewart I think is coming.
Uh,
Taylor.
Vixen is coming.
Oh my God.

2851
02:34:53.411 --> 02:34:56.290
How do you have enough microphones for everybody?
I don't pass them around.
Yeah.

2852
02:34:56.291 --> 02:35:00.190
It's going to be more of a such a great idea.
When I quit working for the UFC,

2853
02:35:00.280 --> 02:35:03.490
that's what I'm going to do.
We're going to have a UFC parties and we're gonna.

2854
02:35:03.510 --> 02:35:07.600
We'll do it that way.
Yeah.
Flock.
That's going to be fun.
I can't wait to see that.

2855
02:35:07.660 --> 02:35:10.430
Anyway,
February 4th,
Mandalay Bay theater,
uh,
Joe Diaz,

2856
02:35:10.450 --> 02:35:14.020
Ari Shaffir and me tickets are going fast.
Um,
I'm very excited.

2857
02:35:14.021 --> 02:35:16.570
This is going to be a fucking killer show.
We used to do the house of Blues,

2858
02:35:16.571 --> 02:35:20.740
but we had a problem with them not wanting everybody to be seated.

2859
02:35:21.070 --> 02:35:25.090
And I need everybody to be seated.
That standing shit and comedy club at bars.

2860
02:35:25.091 --> 02:35:28.270
It's just too much of a pain in the ass for you too.
I don't want you to stand.

2861
02:35:28.480 --> 02:35:29.680
I went to one of my friends,

2862
02:35:29.681 --> 02:35:33.250
I went to Doug Stan hope show in La and it changed my mind on standing.

2863
02:35:33.280 --> 02:35:36.370
It's annoying,
man.
Yeah,
you get your feet hurt,
your back hurts.

2864
02:35:36.371 --> 02:35:37.690
Your fucking neck is cracking.

2865
02:35:37.860 --> 02:35:41.740
It's not an enjoyable show and it leads to people talking and it's not the right

2866
02:35:41.741 --> 02:35:44.080
environment.
So we decided to move to Mandalay Bay theater,

2867
02:35:44.081 --> 02:35:47.140
props to the House of Blues.
I still love you bitches,
but I've gotta move.

2868
02:35:47.920 --> 02:35:52.690
We've gotta move on this weekend.
UFC pay per view by it.
You whores.
And,
uh,

2869
02:35:52.750 --> 02:35:56.350
as usual,
I love all of you.
And,
uh,
we will see you next week.
Next week.

2870
02:35:56.351 --> 02:36:00.220
Did you get in touch with Eliza?
Uh,
no I haven't.
No.
Hopefully it will spawn.

2871
02:36:00.260 --> 02:36:03.250
So Twitter her,
and that's where your attack,

2872
02:36:03.251 --> 02:36:06.990
Eliza slessinger until her pitch on.
She doesn't even follow them.

2873
02:36:07.130 --> 02:36:09.820
I tried to send her a private message,
but she doesn't follow me.
Yeah.
Yeah.

2874
02:36:09.821 --> 02:36:11.260
We talked about flushing first level.

2875
02:36:11.380 --> 02:36:16.030
It's always sad when someone you liked us a folio.
Now
Valspar's falls me.

2876
02:36:16.031 --> 02:36:19.240
That's all.
It's important to use.
Dirty,
dirty bitches.
All right.
That's it.

2877
02:36:19.241 --> 02:36:21.340
The show's over at love.
You see you next week.
Bye.
Big cases.

2878
02:36:21.341 --> 02:36:23.680
And I'm on one on one and this one for you.

2879
02:36:25.290 --> 02:36:30.290
