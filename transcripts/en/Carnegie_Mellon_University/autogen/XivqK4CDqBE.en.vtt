extrapolate from those experiments to

00:08:17.659 --> 00:08:17.669
extrapolate from those experiments to
 

00:08:17.669 --> 00:08:23.089
extrapolate from those experiments to
the whole ocean or to the future so but

00:08:23.089 --> 00:08:23.099
the whole ocean or to the future so but
 

00:08:23.099 --> 00:08:25.189
the whole ocean or to the future so but
the field has gone another way so what I

00:08:25.189 --> 00:08:25.199
the field has gone another way so what I
 

00:08:25.199 --> 00:08:27.170
the field has gone another way so what I
do is a bit different and the field has

00:08:27.170 --> 00:08:27.180
do is a bit different and the field has
 

00:08:27.180 --> 00:08:29.179
do is a bit different and the field has
gone mostly to this sort of experiments

00:08:29.179 --> 00:08:29.189
gone mostly to this sort of experiments
 

00:08:29.189 --> 00:08:31.489
gone mostly to this sort of experiments
and they exist in no away couple of

00:08:31.489 --> 00:08:31.499
and they exist in no away couple of
 

00:08:31.499 --> 00:08:34.069
and they exist in no away couple of
places beautiful experiments are in

00:08:34.069 --> 00:08:34.079
places beautiful experiments are in
 

00:08:34.079 --> 00:08:37.309

of what's in the surface water is going
 

00:08:45.630 --> 00:08:48.470
of what's in the surface water is going
to be in it okay and then you bubble co2

00:08:48.470 --> 00:08:48.480
to be in it okay and then you bubble co2
 

00:08:48.480 --> 00:08:50.569
to be in it okay and then you bubble co2
or do you do whatever and you carry the

00:08:50.569 --> 00:08:50.579
or do you do whatever and you carry the
 

00:08:50.579 --> 00:08:52.330

experiments for several days we

00:08:52.330 --> 00:08:52.340
experiments for several days we
 

00:08:52.340 --> 00:08:53.770
experiments for several days we
weeks and then you look at the

00:08:53.770 --> 00:08:53.780
weeks and then you look at the
 

00:08:53.780 --> 00:08:55.870
weeks and then you look at the
difference between the treatments and

00:08:55.870 --> 00:08:55.880
difference between the treatments and
 

00:08:55.880 --> 00:08:59.170
difference between the treatments and
the control okay it's a very interesting

00:08:59.170 --> 00:08:59.180
the control okay it's a very interesting
 

00:08:59.180 --> 00:09:01.600
the control okay it's a very interesting
experiments the difficulty in my view is

00:09:01.600 --> 00:09:01.610
experiments the difficulty in my view is
 

00:09:01.610 --> 00:09:04.150
experiments the difficulty in my view is
that can use predict that the same thing

00:09:04.150 --> 00:09:04.160
that can use predict that the same thing
 

00:09:04.160 --> 00:09:06.100
that can use predict that the same thing
will happen in another package under the

will happen in another package under the
 

00:09:06.110 --> 00:09:07.600
will happen in another package under the
same condition no because different

00:09:07.600 --> 00:09:07.610
same condition no because different
 

00:09:07.610 --> 00:09:09.010
same condition no because different
organisms will be there so it's very

00:09:09.010 --> 00:09:09.020
organisms will be there so it's very
 

00:09:09.020 --> 00:09:10.570
organisms will be there so it's very
difficult to go from one of those

00:09:10.570 --> 00:09:10.580
difficult to go from one of those
 

00:09:10.580 --> 00:09:13.150
difficult to go from one of those
experiments to a generalization to the

they've been doing open face what is it
 

00:11:34.899 --> 00:11:39.780
they've been doing open face what is it
call face anyway it doesn't matter and

the point that we've been increasing co2

00:11:42.329 --> 00:11:42.339
the point that we've been increasing co2
 

00:11:42.339 --> 00:11:44.550
the point that we've been increasing co2
and the result is that you see in net

00:11:44.550 --> 00:11:44.560
and the result is that you see in net
 

00:11:44.560 --> 00:11:46.920
and the result is that you see in net
increase in the growth of plants and

00:11:46.920 --> 00:11:46.930
increase in the growth of plants and
 

00:11:46.930 --> 00:11:48.960
increase in the growth of plants and
I've seen a report just before coming

00:11:48.960 --> 00:11:48.970
I've seen a report just before coming
 

00:11:48.970 --> 00:11:50.759
I've seen a report just before coming
here from my colleagues at Princeton and

00:11:50.759 --> 00:11:50.769
here from my colleagues at Princeton and
 

00:11:50.769 --> 00:11:53.639
here from my colleagues at Princeton and
the estimate is that were it not for

00:11:53.639 --> 00:11:53.649
the estimate is that were it not for
 

00:11:53.649 --> 00:11:56.550
the estimate is that were it not for
this effect of co2 on plant growth the

00:11:56.550 --> 00:11:56.560
this effect of co2 on plant growth the
 

00:11:56.560 --> 00:11:58.620
this effect of co2 on plant growth the
increase of co2 in the atmosphere would

00:11:58.620 --> 00:11:58.630
increase of co2 in the atmosphere would
 

00:11:58.630 --> 00:12:00.540
increase of co2 in the atmosphere would
be eighty percent larger than it is now

00:12:00.540 --> 00:12:00.550
be eighty percent larger than it is now
 

00:12:00.550 --> 00:12:03.210
be eighty percent larger than it is now
so it's an enormous effect on socio to

00:12:03.210 --> 00:12:03.220
so it's an enormous effect on socio to
 

00:12:03.220 --> 00:12:04.949
so it's an enormous effect on socio to
fertilization is not a trivial effect

00:12:04.949 --> 00:12:04.959
fertilization is not a trivial effect
 

00:12:04.959 --> 00:12:06.630
fertilization is not a trivial effect
it's accounted for by the in all the

00:12:06.630 --> 00:12:06.640
it's accounted for by the in all the
 

00:12:06.640 --> 00:12:08.699
it's accounted for by the in all the
predictions so it's a very large effect

00:12:08.699 --> 00:12:08.709
predictions so it's a very large effect
 

00:12:08.709 --> 00:12:11.100
predictions so it's a very large effect
on land plants and the question is

00:12:11.100 --> 00:12:11.110
on land plants and the question is
 

00:12:11.110 --> 00:12:14.100
on land plants and the question is
should it also occur in marine plants in

00:12:14.100 --> 00:12:14.110
should it also occur in marine plants in
 

00:12:14.110 --> 00:12:17.340
should it also occur in marine plants in
phytoplankton and we expect or expected

00:12:17.340 --> 00:12:17.350
phytoplankton and we expect or expected
 

00:12:17.350 --> 00:12:19.920
phytoplankton and we expect or expected
that it should and I'll tell you why so

00:12:19.920 --> 00:12:19.930
that it should and I'll tell you why so
 

00:12:19.930 --> 00:12:22.560
that it should and I'll tell you why so
this is my most difficult slide this is

00:12:22.560 --> 00:12:22.570
this is my most difficult slide this is
 

00:12:22.570 --> 00:12:25.470
this is my most difficult slide this is

the problem is that 10 micro molar is
 

00:12:37.779 --> 00:12:39.689
the problem is that 10 micro molar is
not enough to make the enzyme work well

00:12:39.689 --> 00:12:39.699

study corals very good people doing that

00:21:42.180 --> 00:21:42.190

and then so this study is interesting

00:21:49.950 --> 00:21:49.960
and then so this study is interesting
 

00:21:49.960 --> 00:21:51.570
and then so this study is interesting
because it sort of explains the

a compartment if you want in which the

00:22:13.600 --> 00:22:13.610
a compartment if you want in which the
 

00:22:13.610 --> 00:22:16.450
a compartment if you want in which the
chemistry is partly controlled by the

00:22:16.450 --> 00:22:16.460
chemistry is partly controlled by the
 

00:22:16.460 --> 00:22:18.760
chemistry is partly controlled by the
organism and for example if some data

00:22:18.760 --> 00:22:18.770
organism and for example if some data
 

00:22:18.770 --> 00:22:22.000
organism and for example if some data
here's the ph of seawater and is a ph

00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:22.010
here's the ph of seawater and is a ph
 

00:22:22.010 --> 00:22:23.620
here's the ph of seawater and is a ph
actually measured in that compartment

00:22:23.620 --> 00:22:23.630
actually measured in that compartment
 

00:22:23.630 --> 00:22:25.210
actually measured in that compartment
which is a very difficult thing to do

00:22:25.210 --> 00:22:25.220
which is a very difficult thing to do
 

00:22:25.220 --> 00:22:27.820
which is a very difficult thing to do
and what you can see that it does change

00:22:27.820 --> 00:22:27.830
and what you can see that it does change
 

00:22:27.830 --> 00:22:30.610
and what you can see that it does change
with the ph of seawater but not exactly

00:22:30.610 --> 00:22:30.620
with the ph of seawater but not exactly
 

00:22:30.620 --> 00:22:32.320
with the ph of seawater but not exactly
one to one it's actually buffered right

00:22:32.320 --> 00:22:32.330
one to one it's actually buffered right
 

00:22:32.330 --> 00:22:34.270
one to one it's actually buffered right
and you could lower the pH well the the

00:22:34.270 --> 00:22:34.280
and you could lower the pH well the the
 

00:22:34.280 --> 00:22:36.490
and you could lower the pH well the the
Delta the difference gets larger and

00:22:36.490 --> 00:22:36.500
Delta the difference gets larger and
 

00:22:36.500 --> 00:22:38.500
Delta the difference gets larger and
interestingly enough they are self data

00:22:38.500 --> 00:22:38.510
interestingly enough they are self data
 

00:22:38.510 --> 00:22:40.630
interestingly enough they are self data
they're showing that for deep-sea corals

00:22:40.630 --> 00:22:40.640
they're showing that for deep-sea corals
 

00:22:40.640 --> 00:22:42.789
they're showing that for deep-sea corals
which are stable even in very

00:22:42.789 --> 00:22:42.799
which are stable even in very
 

00:22:42.799 --> 00:22:45.430
which are stable even in very
understated seawater the inside the pH

00:22:45.430 --> 00:22:45.440
understated seawater the inside the pH
 

00:22:45.440 --> 00:22:47.169
understated seawater the inside the pH
that doesn't change at all and so

00:22:47.169 --> 00:22:47.179
that doesn't change at all and so
 

00:22:47.179 --> 00:22:49.330
that doesn't change at all and so
there's an ability by those organism to

00:22:49.330 --> 00:22:49.340
there's an ability by those organism to
 

00:22:49.340 --> 00:22:52.450
there's an ability by those organism to
control the pH in the compartment in

00:22:52.450 --> 00:22:52.460
control the pH in the compartment in
 

00:22:52.460 --> 00:22:55.120
control the pH in the compartment in
which the calcite that the aragonite is

00:22:55.120 --> 00:22:55.130
which the calcite that the aragonite is
 

00:22:55.130 --> 00:22:57.190
which the calcite that the aragonite is
formed and so depending on the exact

00:22:57.190 --> 00:22:57.200
formed and so depending on the exact
 

00:22:57.200 --> 00:22:58.960
formed and so depending on the exact
organism you get more or less of a

00:22:58.960 --> 00:22:58.970
organism you get more or less of a
 

00:22:58.970 --> 00:23:00.850
organism you get more or less of a
response depending on whether you allow

00:23:00.850 --> 00:23:00.860
response depending on whether you allow
 

00:23:00.860 --> 00:23:02.409
response depending on whether you allow
them to control that pH you get a

00:23:02.409 --> 00:23:02.419
them to control that pH you get a
 

00:23:02.419 --> 00:23:04.750
them to control that pH you get a
response so this great complication it's

00:23:04.750 --> 00:23:04.760
response so this great complication it's
 

00:23:04.760 --> 00:23:06.280
response so this great complication it's
not something which happens because

00:23:06.280 --> 00:23:06.290
not something which happens because
 

00:23:06.290 --> 00:23:09.070
not something which happens because
simply of the chemistry outside depends

00:23:09.070 --> 00:23:09.080
simply of the chemistry outside depends
 

00:23:09.080 --> 00:23:10.780
simply of the chemistry outside depends
a great deal where the organism can do

00:23:10.780 --> 00:23:10.790
a great deal where the organism can do
 

00:23:10.790 --> 00:23:13.270
a great deal where the organism can do
in controlling the chemistry at the

more pho metastasis all right so all

00:23:33.330 --> 00:23:33.340
more pho metastasis all right so all
 

00:23:33.340 --> 00:23:36.190

ah so we've done experiments with this
 

00:28:52.109 --> 00:28:55.399
ah so we've done experiments with this
and what we find is a clear decrease in

the pH so why is that happening and not
quite sure but that's what they did

00:29:23.389 --> 00:29:23.399
quite sure but that's what they did
 

00:29:23.399 --> 00:29:28.419
quite sure but that's what they did
actually show does this always occur no

00:29:28.419 --> 00:29:28.429
actually show does this always occur no

actually show does this always occur no
so we send some undergraduate students

00:29:31.369 --> 00:29:31.379
so we send some undergraduate students
 

00:29:31.379 --> 00:29:34.669
so we send some undergraduate students
in the near Bermuda and they do the

00:29:34.669 --> 00:29:34.679
in the near Bermuda and they do the
 

00:29:34.679 --> 00:29:36.680
in the near Bermuda and they do the
experiment what they like to do that

actually not I'm happy to do that it

00:29:38.509 --> 00:29:38.519
actually not I'm happy to do that it
 

00:29:38.519 --> 00:29:41.419
actually not I'm happy to do that it
turns out and what they did is you know

then change the pH well co2 and version

00:29:51.499 --> 00:29:51.509
then change the pH well co2 and version
 

00:29:51.509 --> 00:29:53.389
then change the pH well co2 and version
what's happening in these them average

what's happening in these them average
 

00:29:53.399 --> 00:29:57.949
what's happening in these them average
result right here it clear increase okay

00:29:57.949 --> 00:29:57.959
result right here it clear increase okay
 

00:29:57.959 --> 00:30:00.440
result right here it clear increase okay
so opposite is there a reason for that

00:30:00.440 --> 00:30:00.450
so opposite is there a reason for that
 

00:30:00.450 --> 00:30:02.599
so opposite is there a reason for that
well there are at least two possible

00:30:02.599 --> 00:30:02.609
well there are at least two possible
 

00:30:02.609 --> 00:30:04.519
well there are at least two possible
reasons one is that of course they have

00:30:04.519 --> 00:30:04.529
reasons one is that of course they have
 

00:30:04.529 --> 00:30:06.560

all the other nutrients were in the lab

00:30:06.560 --> 00:30:06.570
all the other nutrients were in the lab
 

00:30:06.570 --> 00:30:08.209
all the other nutrients were in the lab
and the very controlled conditions were

00:30:08.209 --> 00:30:08.219
and the very controlled conditions were
 

00:30:08.219 --> 00:30:11.629
and the very controlled conditions were
limited the iron for example also they

00:30:11.629 --> 00:30:11.639
limited the iron for example also they
 

00:30:11.639 --> 00:30:13.669
limited the iron for example also they
collected those fairly large aggregates

00:30:13.669 --> 00:30:13.679
collected those fairly large aggregates
 

00:30:13.679 --> 00:30:16.489
collected those fairly large aggregates
of cells which means that co2 diffusion

00:30:16.489 --> 00:30:16.499
of cells which means that co2 diffusion
 

00:30:16.499 --> 00:30:18.889
of cells which means that co2 diffusion
becomes a real problem and higher co2

00:30:18.889 --> 00:30:18.899
becomes a real problem and higher co2
 

00:30:18.899 --> 00:30:20.719
becomes a real problem and higher co2
becomes really beneficial in that case

00:30:20.719 --> 00:30:20.729
becomes really beneficial in that case
 

00:30:20.729 --> 00:30:23.180
becomes really beneficial in that case
well in our single cell system it does

00:30:23.180 --> 00:30:23.190
well in our single cell system it does
 

00:30:23.190 --> 00:30:24.680
well in our single cell system it does
not have care so there is a another

00:30:24.680 --> 00:30:24.690
not have care so there is a another
 

00:30:24.690 --> 00:30:27.440
not have care so there is a another
reason and we think that the co2 effect

00:30:27.440 --> 00:30:27.450
reason and we think that the co2 effect
 

00:30:27.450 --> 00:30:29.779
reason and we think that the co2 effect
becomes important in the collection in

00:30:29.779 --> 00:30:29.789
becomes important in the collection in
 

00:30:29.789 --> 00:30:32.359
becomes important in the collection in
the collected drink ohms and it's not

00:30:32.359 --> 00:30:32.369
the collected drink ohms and it's not
 

00:30:32.369 --> 00:30:37.569
the collected drink ohms and it's not
important in the lab the single cell

00:30:37.569 --> 00:30:37.579
 
 

00:30:37.579 --> 00:30:41.569
 
alright complications I like a little

00:30:41.569 --> 00:30:41.579
alright complications I like a little
 

00:30:41.579 --> 00:30:44.319
alright complications I like a little
thing it's like a watch swiss watch

00:30:44.319 --> 00:30:44.329
thing it's like a watch swiss watch

ocean warming

00:30:49.360 --> 00:30:49.370
 
 

00:30:49.370 --> 00:30:53.090
 
alright the problem with sitting ocean

00:30:53.090 --> 00:30:53.100
alright the problem with sitting ocean
 

00:30:53.100 --> 00:30:54.920
alright the problem with sitting ocean
acidification is that it's not happening

00:30:54.920 --> 00:30:54.930
acidification is that it's not happening
 

00:30:54.930 --> 00:30:57.140
acidification is that it's not happening
all by itself other things are changing

00:30:57.140 --> 00:30:57.150
all by itself other things are changing
 

00:30:57.150 --> 00:31:01.550
all by itself other things are changing
in the ocean and I want to mention the

00:31:01.550 --> 00:31:01.560
in the ocean and I want to mention the
 

00:31:01.560 --> 00:31:03.500
in the ocean and I want to mention the
warming and the mixing the temperature

00:31:03.500 --> 00:31:03.510
warming and the mixing the temperature
 

00:31:03.510 --> 00:31:05.300
warming and the mixing the temperature
increases so in the future we're going

00:31:05.300 --> 00:31:05.310
increases so in the future we're going
 

00:31:05.310 --> 00:31:07.910
increases so in the future we're going
to have a surface ocean plus 3 plus 6

00:31:07.910 --> 00:31:07.920
to have a surface ocean plus 3 plus 6
 

00:31:07.920 --> 00:31:09.680
to have a surface ocean plus 3 plus 6
degrees we don't know better first a few

00:31:09.680 --> 00:31:09.690
degrees we don't know better first a few
 

00:31:09.690 --> 00:31:12.380
degrees we don't know better first a few
degrees what does that do well first of

00:31:12.380 --> 00:31:12.390
degrees what does that do well first of
 

00:31:12.390 --> 00:31:14.330
degrees what does that do well first of
all it's changing temperature so the

00:31:14.330 --> 00:31:14.340
all it's changing temperature so the
 

00:31:14.340 --> 00:31:16.820
all it's changing temperature so the
organisms have a change in pH but also a

00:31:16.820 --> 00:31:16.830
organisms have a change in pH but also a
 

00:31:16.830 --> 00:31:19.160
organisms have a change in pH but also a
change in temperature how does that work

00:31:19.160 --> 00:31:19.170
change in temperature how does that work
 

00:31:19.170 --> 00:31:22.610
change in temperature how does that work
together then because it's warmer you

00:31:22.610 --> 00:31:22.620
together then because it's warmer you
 

00:31:22.620 --> 00:31:25.280
together then because it's warmer you
get a stratification because shallower

00:31:25.280 --> 00:31:25.290
get a stratification because shallower
 

00:31:25.290 --> 00:31:27.140
get a stratification because shallower
we change the stratification of the

00:31:27.140 --> 00:31:27.150
we change the stratification of the
 

00:31:27.150 --> 00:31:29.990
we change the stratification of the
surface ocean which means that you get

00:31:29.990 --> 00:31:30.000
surface ocean which means that you get
 

00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:33.020
surface ocean which means that you get
less input of nutrients from the bottom

00:31:33.020 --> 00:31:33.030
less input of nutrients from the bottom
 

00:31:33.030 --> 00:31:36.550
less input of nutrients from the bottom
the chain is a change in the input of

00:31:36.550 --> 00:31:36.560
the chain is a change in the input of
 

00:31:36.560 --> 00:31:40.250
the chain is a change in the input of
nitrogen or iron or phosphorus to the

00:31:40.250 --> 00:31:40.260
nitrogen or iron or phosphorus to the
 

00:31:40.260 --> 00:31:43.000
nitrogen or iron or phosphorus to the
surface water for the cells to grow and

00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:43.010
surface water for the cells to grow and
 

00:31:43.010 --> 00:31:47.000
surface water for the cells to grow and
then because if you are shallower you

00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:47.010
then because if you are shallower you
 

00:31:47.010 --> 00:31:51.050
then because if you are shallower you
end up with in fact more light in there

00:31:51.050 --> 00:31:51.060
end up with in fact more light in there
 

00:31:51.060 --> 00:31:52.580
end up with in fact more light in there
because you don't go as deep so the

00:31:52.580 --> 00:31:52.590
because you don't go as deep so the
 

00:31:52.590 --> 00:31:54.020
because you don't go as deep so the
phytoplankton of the surface have more

00:31:54.020 --> 00:31:54.030
phytoplankton of the surface have more
 

00:31:54.030 --> 00:31:56.870
phytoplankton of the surface have more
light so you changing the pH you're

00:31:56.870 --> 00:31:56.880
light so you changing the pH you're
 

00:31:56.880 --> 00:31:58.940
light so you changing the pH you're
changing weather co2 as I've told you in

00:31:58.940 --> 00:31:58.950

the carbonate but you're also changing

00:32:00.740 --> 00:32:00.750
the carbonate but you're also changing
 

00:32:00.750 --> 00:32:04.280

experiments right so we do one thing at

00:32:11.240 --> 00:32:11.250
experiments right so we do one thing at
 

00:32:11.250 --> 00:32:12.740

it's friendly very difficult okay so

00:32:52.220 --> 00:32:52.230
it's friendly very difficult okay so
 

00:32:52.230 --> 00:32:54.950
it's friendly very difficult okay so
when we talk of change in ecosystems you

00:32:54.950 --> 00:32:54.960
when we talk of change in ecosystems you
 

00:32:54.960 --> 00:32:56.300
when we talk of change in ecosystems you
know how do we deal with this question

00:32:56.300 --> 00:32:56.310
know how do we deal with this question
 

00:32:56.310 --> 00:32:59.330

pay price I think the most likely are
 

00:33:24.340 --> 00:33:27.240
pay price I think the most likely are
going to be the corals because they are

00:33:27.240 --> 00:33:27.250
going to be the corals because they are
 

00:33:27.250 --> 00:33:30.600
going to be the corals because they are
affected by the pH they affected by the

people have talked of some of the snails

00:33:53.970 --> 00:33:53.980
people have talked of some of the snails
 

00:33:53.980 --> 00:33:57.240
people have talked of some of the snails
in the northern ocean and the important

in the northern ocean and the important
 

00:33:57.250 --> 00:34:00.269
in the northern ocean and the important
thing for fish etc we don't know but it

00:34:00.269 --> 00:34:00.279
thing for fish etc we don't know but it
 

00:34:00.279 --> 00:34:01.379

seems to me that there would be some

00:34:01.379 --> 00:34:01.389
seems to me that there would be some
 

00:34:01.389 --> 00:34:11.909
seems to me that there would be some
effects okay so what I'm going to say

00:34:11.909 --> 00:34:11.919
effects okay so what I'm going to say
 

00:34:11.919 --> 00:34:14.550

we work in the same field would not be

00:34:15.690 --> 00:34:15.700
we work in the same field would not be

you understand so I don't want you to

00:34:22.349 --> 00:34:22.359
you understand so I don't want you to
 

00:34:22.359 --> 00:34:25.200
you understand so I don't want you to
repeat that to anybody but my sense that

00:34:25.200 --> 00:34:25.210
repeat that to anybody but my sense that
 

00:34:25.210 --> 00:34:27.899
repeat that to anybody but my sense that
it is not the most pressing problem of

00:34:27.899 --> 00:34:27.909
it is not the most pressing problem of
 

00:34:27.909 --> 00:34:29.250
it is not the most pressing problem of
global change it's an important when we

00:34:29.250 --> 00:34:29.260
global change it's an important when we
 

00:34:29.260 --> 00:34:30.869
global change it's an important when we
should study it but there are other

00:34:30.869 --> 00:34:30.879
should study it but there are other
 

00:34:30.879 --> 00:34:32.190
should study it but there are other
problems that are more pressing and I

00:34:32.190 --> 00:34:32.200
problems that are more pressing and I
 

00:34:32.200 --> 00:34:33.780
problems that are more pressing and I
think there are two reasons for that and

00:34:33.780 --> 00:34:33.790
think there are two reasons for that and
 

00:34:33.790 --> 00:34:36.960
think there are two reasons for that and
the first one has to do with the fact

00:34:36.960 --> 00:34:36.970
the first one has to do with the fact
 

00:34:36.970 --> 00:34:39.659
the first one has to do with the fact
that indeed the ocean are based on the

00:34:39.659 --> 00:34:39.669
that indeed the ocean are based on the
 

00:34:39.669 --> 00:34:41.220
that indeed the ocean are based on the
food chain which is based on microscopic

00:34:41.220 --> 00:34:41.230
food chain which is based on microscopic
 

00:34:41.230 --> 00:34:43.950

organism so they can actually grow very
 

00:34:43.960 --> 00:34:45.839
organism so they can actually grow very
fast they can adapt they can invade and

00:34:45.839 --> 00:34:45.849
fast they can adapt they can invade and
 

00:34:45.849 --> 00:34:47.760
fast they can adapt they can invade and
in the fluid medium things can move very

00:34:47.760 --> 00:34:47.770
in the fluid medium things can move very
 

00:34:47.770 --> 00:34:50.399
in the fluid medium things can move very
quickly that's different from land trees

00:34:50.399 --> 00:34:50.409

very fast ok so there's another problem

00:34:57.240 --> 00:34:57.250
very fast ok so there's another problem
 

00:34:57.250 --> 00:34:58.980
very fast ok so there's another problem
every to do with land and I think that

00:34:58.980 --> 00:34:58.990
every to do with land and I think that
 

00:34:58.990 --> 00:35:01.559
every to do with land and I think that
that first thing is scientific I think

00:35:01.559 --> 00:35:01.569
that first thing is scientific I think
 

00:35:01.569 --> 00:35:04.079
that first thing is scientific I think
is more likely for ocean ecosystem to

is more likely for ocean ecosystem to
 

00:35:04.089 --> 00:35:06.690
is more likely for ocean ecosystem to
adapt the change in the environment than

00:35:06.690 --> 00:35:06.700
adapt the change in the environment than
 

00:35:06.700 --> 00:35:09.510
adapt the change in the environment than
from land ecosystem personal opinion ok

00:35:09.510 --> 00:35:09.520
from land ecosystem personal opinion ok
 

00:35:09.520 --> 00:35:12.089
from land ecosystem personal opinion ok

00:35:41.579 --> 00:35:41.589
great routes so there's a direct effect
 

00:35:41.589 --> 00:35:44.130
great routes so there's a direct effect
on people which is more dramatic in some

00:35:44.130 --> 00:35:44.140
on people which is more dramatic in some
 

00:35:44.140 --> 00:35:46.710
on people which is more dramatic in some
other effects of global change so it's

00:35:46.710 --> 00:35:46.720
other effects of global change so it's
 

00:35:46.720 --> 00:35:48.509
other effects of global change so it's
not that sure thing as a feature is not

00:35:48.509 --> 00:35:48.519
not that sure thing as a feature is not
 

00:35:48.519 --> 00:35:50.670
not that sure thing as a feature is not
important but I think it has probably

00:35:50.670 --> 00:35:50.680
important but I think it has probably
 

00:35:50.680 --> 00:35:53.009
important but I think it has probably
more subtle effects and less direct the

00:35:53.009 --> 00:35:53.019
more subtle effects and less direct the
 

00:35:53.019 --> 00:35:55.200
more subtle effects and less direct the
effect on people okay so i get don't

00:35:55.200 --> 00:35:55.210
effect on people okay so i get don't
 

00:35:55.210 --> 00:35:57.240
effect on people okay so i get don't
tell my friends you yeah until the

00:35:57.240 --> 00:35:57.250
tell my friends you yeah until the
 

00:35:57.250 --> 00:36:00.150
tell my friends you yeah until the
career on that but i think the science

00:36:00.150 --> 00:36:00.160
career on that but i think the science
 

00:36:00.160 --> 00:36:01.170
career on that but i think the science
has to be done we have to understand

00:36:01.170 --> 00:36:01.180
has to be done we have to understand
 

00:36:01.180 --> 00:36:03.240
has to be done we have to understand
more but i think that there are very

00:36:03.240 --> 00:36:03.250
more but i think that there are very
 

00:36:03.250 --> 00:36:04.769
more but i think that there are very
pressing problems that are not addressed

00:36:04.769 --> 00:36:04.779
pressing problems that are not addressed
 

00:36:04.779 --> 00:36:08.789

doesn't change to a first approximation
that doesn't change ok so the calcium

00:37:41.450 --> 00:37:41.460
that doesn't change ok so the calcium
 

00:37:41.460 --> 00:37:43.760

sorry so if you're telling me that the

00:38:22.880 --> 00:38:22.890
sorry so if you're telling me that the
 

00:38:22.890 --> 00:38:25.370
sorry so if you're telling me that the
increase in co2 will change weathering

00:38:25.370 --> 00:38:25.380
increase in co2 will change weathering
 

00:38:25.380 --> 00:38:29.150
increase in co2 will change weathering
that may well be true but my talk was

00:38:29.150 --> 00:38:29.160
that may well be true but my talk was
 

00:38:29.160 --> 00:38:31.040
that may well be true but my talk was
only about ocean acidification so I

00:38:31.040 --> 00:38:31.050
only about ocean acidification so I

there's not much geological change in
 

00:38:33.450 --> 00:38:36.020
there's not much geological change in
the ocean right now remember the co2 is

00:38:36.020 --> 00:38:36.030
the ocean right now remember the co2 is
 

00:38:36.030 --> 00:38:39.680
the ocean right now remember the co2 is
only at the surface for now deep sea

00:38:39.680 --> 00:38:39.690

00:38:50.660 --> 00:38:50.670
geochemical geological effect that's
 

00:38:50.670 --> 00:38:52.520
geochemical geological effect that's
going to be miniscule for years and

00:38:52.520 --> 00:38:52.530
going to be miniscule for years and
 

00:38:52.530 --> 00:38:54.440
going to be miniscule for years and
years to come so the question is really

00:38:54.440 --> 00:38:54.450
years to come so the question is really
 

00:38:54.450 --> 00:38:57.260
years to come so the question is really
that of the impact on the organisms and

00:38:57.260 --> 00:38:57.270
that of the impact on the organisms and
 

00:38:57.270 --> 00:38:59.290
that of the impact on the organisms and
the on the ecosystem that the song

00:38:59.290 --> 00:38:59.300
the on the ecosystem that the song

them inhabit ok so I think nobody really

00:39:02.740 --> 00:39:02.750
them inhabit ok so I think nobody really
 

00:39:02.750 --> 00:39:04.240

phytoplankton increase the settling of
 

00:40:08.760 --> 00:40:10.980
phytoplankton increase the settling of
phytoplankton to the deep which actually

00:40:10.980 --> 00:40:10.990

and so you put a lot of line but most of

00:40:59.280 --> 00:40:59.290
and so you put a lot of line but most of
 

00:40:59.290 --> 00:41:01.859
and so you put a lot of line but most of
it just goes to the bottom and so you

it just goes to the bottom and so you
 

00:41:01.869 --> 00:41:05.250
it just goes to the bottom and so you
have a transient effect okay which means

of course is that some fun actually fall

00:41:58.370 --> 00:41:58.380
of course is that some fun actually fall

of course is that some fun actually fall
to the bottom but much of it doesn't

that of course is that if you put high

00:43:33.150 --> 00:43:33.160
that of course is that if you put high
 

00:43:33.160 --> 00:43:35.400

calcium carbonate is in precipitate as
 

00:43:40.600 --> 00:43:43.140
calcium carbonate is in precipitate as
much as well ok and so in the ocean

00:43:43.140 --> 00:43:43.150
much as well ok and so in the ocean
 

00:43:43.150 --> 00:43:45.840

00:44:02.980 --> 00:44:06.120
full of calcium carbonate but not a
depth ok and so the question is whether

00:44:06.120 --> 00:44:06.130
depth ok and so the question is whether
 

00:44:06.130 --> 00:44:09.210
depth ok and so the question is whether
that line that depth changes with time

00:44:09.210 --> 00:44:09.220
that line that depth changes with time
 

00:44:09.220 --> 00:44:11.610
that line that depth changes with time
it does change of course of a geological

00:44:11.610 --> 00:44:11.620
it does change of course of a geological
 

00:44:11.620 --> 00:44:13.290
it does change of course of a geological
epoch we know that is it going to change

00:44:13.290 --> 00:44:13.300
epoch we know that is it going to change
 

00:44:13.300 --> 00:44:15.570
epoch we know that is it going to change
today well it will change you a little

00:44:15.570 --> 00:44:15.580
today well it will change you a little
 

00:44:15.580 --> 00:44:17.580
today well it will change you a little
bit but not very much and not right away

00:44:17.580 --> 00:44:17.590
bit but not very much and not right away
 

00:44:17.590 --> 00:44:22.140
bit but not very much and not right away
and so one of the question will be as we

00:44:22.140 --> 00:44:22.150
and so one of the question will be as we
 

00:44:22.150 --> 00:44:24.480
and so one of the question will be as we
acidify the ocean will there be a change

00:44:24.480 --> 00:44:24.490
acidify the ocean will there be a change
 

00:44:24.490 --> 00:44:27.510
acidify the ocean will there be a change
in the calcium carbonate cycle changing

00:44:27.510 --> 00:44:27.520
in the calcium carbonate cycle changing
 

00:44:27.520 --> 00:44:28.890
in the calcium carbonate cycle changing

the ocean is essentially compensating

00:44:31.320 --> 00:44:31.330
the ocean is essentially compensating
 

00:44:31.330 --> 00:44:32.630
the ocean is essentially compensating
for the effective acidification

00:44:32.630 --> 00:44:32.640
for the effective acidification

essentially maintaining pH and so forth
constant the problem that the timeframe

00:44:37.680 --> 00:44:37.690
constant the problem that the timeframe
 

00:44:37.690 --> 00:44:39.540
constant the problem that the timeframe
for that is much much longer than a

00:44:39.540 --> 00:44:39.550
for that is much much longer than a
 

00:44:39.550 --> 00:44:41.400
for that is much much longer than a
century we're talking of thousands of

00:44:41.400 --> 00:44:41.410
century we're talking of thousands of
 

00:44:41.410 --> 00:44:44.280
century we're talking of thousands of
years so again we not predicting I'm not

00:44:44.280 --> 00:44:44.290
years so again we not predicting I'm not
 

00:44:44.290 --> 00:44:45.570
years so again we not predicting I'm not
trying to create thousands of years and

00:44:45.570 --> 00:44:45.580
trying to create thousands of years and
 

00:44:45.580 --> 00:44:47.790
trying to create thousands of years and
like to hope I could find five years and

00:44:47.790 --> 00:44:47.800
like to hope I could find five years and
 

00:44:47.800 --> 00:44:49.920
like to hope I could find five years and
be happy 10 be great 50 young we're

00:44:49.920 --> 00:44:49.930
be happy 10 be great 50 young we're
 

00:44:49.930 --> 00:44:51.810
be happy 10 be great 50 young we're
trying to do 100 years but thousands of

00:44:51.810 --> 00:44:51.820
trying to do 100 years but thousands of
 

00:44:51.820 --> 00:44:53.760
trying to do 100 years but thousands of
years is not even happen to us right now

00:44:53.760 --> 00:44:53.770
years is not even happen to us right now
 

00:44:53.770 --> 00:44:59.810
years is not even happen to us right now
oh okay so thinking of other effects I

00:44:59.810 --> 00:44:59.820
oh okay so thinking of other effects I
 

00:44:59.820 --> 00:45:00.870
oh okay so thinking of other effects I
think

00:45:00.870 --> 00:45:00.880
think
 

00:45:00.880 --> 00:45:03.569
think
that you know we're talking of storms

00:45:03.569 --> 00:45:03.579
that you know we're talking of storms
 

00:45:03.579 --> 00:45:06.359
that you know we're talking of storms
we're talking of drought I think sea

00:45:06.359 --> 00:45:06.369
we're talking of drought I think sea
 

00:45:06.369 --> 00:45:08.490
we're talking of drought I think sea
level changes can become dramatic they

00:45:08.490 --> 00:45:08.500
level changes can become dramatic they
 

00:45:08.500 --> 00:45:10.049
level changes can become dramatic they

me look more dramatic than the
 

00:45:26.970 --> 00:45:29.029
me look more dramatic than the

this question in the back yeah mention

00:45:35.069 --> 00:45:35.079
this question in the back yeah mention
 

00:45:35.079 --> 00:45:37.769
this question in the back yeah mention
you mentioned that in that in today's

00:45:37.769 --> 00:45:37.779
you mentioned that in that in today's
 

00:45:37.779 --> 00:45:39.749
you mentioned that in that in today's
time where we have like low levels of

00:45:39.749 --> 00:45:39.759
time where we have like low levels of
 

00:45:39.759 --> 00:45:41.609
time where we have like low levels of
co2 relative to you in high levels of

00:45:41.609 --> 00:45:41.619
co2 relative to you in high levels of
 

00:45:41.619 --> 00:45:44.220

oxygen a rock co is a pretty lousy

00:45:44.220 --> 00:45:44.230
oxygen a rock co is a pretty lousy
 

00:45:44.230 --> 00:45:45.930
oxygen a rock co is a pretty lousy
enzyme and you suggest that that if the

00:45:45.930 --> 00:45:45.940
enzyme and you suggest that that if the
 

00:45:45.940 --> 00:45:47.759
enzyme and you suggest that that if the
good old days when co2 was much higher

00:45:47.759 --> 00:45:47.769
good old days when co2 was much higher
 

00:45:47.769 --> 00:45:49.980
good old days when co2 was much higher
yeah and maybe that's what were involved

00:45:49.980 --> 00:45:49.990
yeah and maybe that's what were involved
 

00:45:49.990 --> 00:45:51.749
yeah and maybe that's what were involved
but in these days the oceans must have

00:45:51.749 --> 00:45:51.759
but in these days the oceans must have
 

00:45:51.759 --> 00:45:53.370
but in these days the oceans must have
been much more acidic so how did any of

00:45:53.370 --> 00:45:53.380
been much more acidic so how did any of
 

00:45:53.380 --> 00:45:55.410
been much more acidic so how did any of
these organisms ever make any shells if

00:45:55.410 --> 00:45:55.420
these organisms ever make any shells if
 

00:45:55.420 --> 00:45:58.380
these organisms ever make any shells if
we're so close to not precipitate

00:45:58.380 --> 00:45:58.390
we're so close to not precipitate
 

00:45:58.390 --> 00:46:03.539
we're so close to not precipitate
precipitating anymore so he asking a

00:46:03.539 --> 00:46:03.549
precipitating anymore so he asking a
 

00:46:03.549 --> 00:46:05.819
precipitating anymore so he asking a
question of what does the chemistry of

00:46:05.819 --> 00:46:05.829
question of what does the chemistry of
 

00:46:05.829 --> 00:46:07.950
question of what does the chemistry of
the ocean more than three billion years

00:46:07.950 --> 00:46:07.960
the ocean more than three billion years
 

00:46:07.960 --> 00:46:10.680
the ocean more than three billion years
ago what you're asking okay and my first

00:46:10.680 --> 00:46:10.690
ago what you're asking okay and my first
 

00:46:10.690 --> 00:46:13.200
ago what you're asking okay and my first
answer is I have no idea okay but then

00:46:13.200 --> 00:46:13.210
answer is I have no idea okay but then
 

00:46:13.210 --> 00:46:15.240
answer is I have no idea okay but then
people of course have more ideas and me

00:46:15.240 --> 00:46:15.250
people of course have more ideas and me
 

00:46:15.250 --> 00:46:16.620
people of course have more ideas and me
and it will tell you answers you don't

00:46:16.620 --> 00:46:16.630
and it will tell you answers you don't
 

00:46:16.630 --> 00:46:18.599
and it will tell you answers you don't
have to believe that but if you will get

00:46:18.599 --> 00:46:18.609
have to believe that but if you will get
 

00:46:18.609 --> 00:46:24.839
have to believe that but if you will get
answers to the question what was the

00:46:24.839 --> 00:46:24.849
answers to the question what was the
 

00:46:24.849 --> 00:46:27.539
answers to the question what was the
SBA's chemistry of the ocean so the

00:46:27.539 --> 00:46:27.549
SBA's chemistry of the ocean so the
 

00:46:27.549 --> 00:46:30.359
SBA's chemistry of the ocean so the
problem is that you had a lot of time

00:46:30.359 --> 00:46:30.369
problem is that you had a lot of time
 

00:46:30.369 --> 00:46:33.839
problem is that you had a lot of time
true right and you had a lot of videos

00:46:33.839 --> 00:46:33.849
true right and you had a lot of videos
 

00:46:33.849 --> 00:46:39.539
true right and you had a lot of videos
sulfur right so you have to understand

00:46:39.539 --> 00:46:39.549
sulfur right so you have to understand
 

00:46:39.549 --> 00:46:41.960
sulfur right so you have to understand
that I've been oxidized on the self

00:46:41.960 --> 00:46:41.970
that I've been oxidized on the self
 

00:46:41.970 --> 00:46:45.480
that I've been oxidized on the self
video software to sulfate we acidified

00:46:45.480 --> 00:46:45.490
video software to sulfate we acidified
 

00:46:45.490 --> 00:46:47.819
video software to sulfate we acidified
the ocean liquid deal so we change the

00:46:47.819 --> 00:46:47.829
the ocean liquid deal so we change the
 

00:46:47.829 --> 00:46:49.890
the ocean liquid deal so we change the
alkalinity at the same time right seem

00:46:49.890 --> 00:46:49.900
alkalinity at the same time right seem
 

00:46:49.900 --> 00:46:51.900
alkalinity at the same time right seem
it's true for iron so one of the

00:46:51.900 --> 00:46:51.910
it's true for iron so one of the
 

00:46:51.910 --> 00:46:54.359
it's true for iron so one of the
complication after your question is what

00:46:54.359 --> 00:46:54.369
complication after your question is what
 

00:46:54.369 --> 00:46:57.329
complication after your question is what
other as base reactions have occurred in

00:46:57.329 --> 00:46:57.339
other as base reactions have occurred in
 

00:46:57.339 --> 00:46:59.670
other as base reactions have occurred in
the same time and it seems to me that

00:46:59.670 --> 00:46:59.680
the same time and it seems to me that
 

00:46:59.680 --> 00:47:01.230
the same time and it seems to me that
there are these two very important

00:47:01.230 --> 00:47:01.240
there are these two very important
 

00:47:01.240 --> 00:47:02.910
there are these two very important
reactions have to do with the redox

00:47:02.910 --> 00:47:02.920
reactions have to do with the redox
 

00:47:02.920 --> 00:47:05.069
reactions have to do with the redox
chemistry of iron and sulfur that

chemistry of iron and sulfur that
 

00:47:05.079 --> 00:47:06.539
chemistry of iron and sulfur that
actually party compensate for your

00:47:06.539 --> 00:47:06.549
actually party compensate for your
 

00:47:06.549 --> 00:47:08.730
actually party compensate for your
question so I'm not sure that the ocean

00:47:08.730 --> 00:47:08.740
question so I'm not sure that the ocean
 

00:47:08.740 --> 00:47:11.039
question so I'm not sure that the ocean
was actually extremely acidic at the

00:47:11.039 --> 00:47:11.049
was actually extremely acidic at the
 

00:47:11.049 --> 00:47:11.470
was actually extremely acidic at the

okay but may have been you have partial

00:47:13.390 --> 00:47:13.400
okay but may have been you have partial
 

00:47:13.400 --> 00:47:15.520
okay but may have been you have partial
pressure of civil you know atmosphere or

00:47:15.520 --> 00:47:15.530
pressure of civil you know atmosphere or

questions David okay all right thanks
professor so my question is based on

00:47:33.730 --> 00:47:33.740
professor so my question is based on
 

00:47:33.740 --> 00:47:37.780
professor so my question is based on
your talk advertising that the ocean

00:47:37.780 --> 00:47:37.790
your talk advertising that the ocean
 

00:47:37.790 --> 00:47:39.940
your talk advertising that the ocean
acidification who caused the decrease of

00:47:39.940 --> 00:47:39.950
acidification who caused the decrease of
 

00:47:39.950 --> 00:47:44.260
acidification who caused the decrease of
coral reefs so I personally assume that

00:47:44.260 --> 00:47:44.270
coral reefs so I personally assume that
 

00:47:44.270 --> 00:47:47.320
coral reefs so I personally assume that
it provides less protection for those

00:47:47.320 --> 00:47:47.330
it provides less protection for those
 

00:47:47.330 --> 00:47:51.370
it provides less protection for those
coastal cities and it probably an reason

00:47:51.370 --> 00:47:51.380
coastal cities and it probably an reason
 

00:47:51.380 --> 00:47:56.080
coastal cities and it probably an reason
for the disaster like sandy storms so so

00:47:56.080 --> 00:47:56.090
for the disaster like sandy storms so so
 

00:47:56.090 --> 00:47:58.180
for the disaster like sandy storms so so
my question is do you use do you see

00:47:58.180 --> 00:47:58.190
my question is do you use do you see
 

00:47:58.190 --> 00:48:00.720
my question is do you use do you see
that on a state of ocean acidification

00:48:00.720 --> 00:48:00.730
that on a state of ocean acidification
 

00:48:00.730 --> 00:48:06.040
that on a state of ocean acidification
has a prediction of some disasters or no

00:48:06.040 --> 00:48:06.050
has a prediction of some disasters or no
 

00:48:06.050 --> 00:48:10.240
has a prediction of some disasters or no
more errors or use it as an indication

00:48:10.240 --> 00:48:10.250
more errors or use it as an indication
 

00:48:10.250 --> 00:48:13.120
more errors or use it as an indication
of these kind of things okay first of

00:48:13.120 --> 00:48:13.130
of these kind of things okay first of
 

00:48:13.130 --> 00:48:15.970
of these kind of things okay first of
all I don't think that sandy was

00:48:15.970 --> 00:48:15.980
all I don't think that sandy was
 

00:48:15.980 --> 00:48:19.450
all I don't think that sandy was
affected in any way by by my coastal

00:48:19.450 --> 00:48:19.460
affected in any way by by my coastal
 

00:48:19.460 --> 00:48:23.230
affected in any way by by my coastal
reefs okay sandy came on there's no I

00:48:23.230 --> 00:48:23.240
reefs okay sandy came on there's no I
 

00:48:23.240 --> 00:48:25.120
reefs okay sandy came on there's no I
promise you can go diving around New

00:48:25.120 --> 00:48:25.130
promise you can go diving around New
 

00:48:25.130 --> 00:48:28.030
promise you can go diving around New
York there there's no coral reef there I

00:48:28.030 --> 00:48:28.040
York there there's no coral reef there I
 

00:48:28.040 --> 00:48:30.099
York there there's no coral reef there I
wish the recovery but it's a Hudson

00:48:30.099 --> 00:48:30.109
wish the recovery but it's a Hudson
 

00:48:30.109 --> 00:48:32.830
wish the recovery but it's a Hudson
River us nice place to die but okay it's

00:48:32.830 --> 00:48:32.840
River us nice place to die but okay it's
 

00:48:32.840 --> 00:48:37.420
River us nice place to die but okay it's
a it's not yes some places are protected

00:48:37.420 --> 00:48:37.430
a it's not yes some places are protected
 

00:48:37.430 --> 00:48:39.700
a it's not yes some places are protected
in part by coral reefs that's true and

00:48:39.700 --> 00:48:39.710
in part by coral reefs that's true and
 

00:48:39.710 --> 00:48:41.740
in part by coral reefs that's true and
if the way to disappear completely could

00:48:41.740 --> 00:48:41.750
if the way to disappear completely could
 

00:48:41.750 --> 00:48:45.490
if the way to disappear completely could
affect their sensitivity to rise in sea

00:48:45.490 --> 00:48:45.500
affect their sensitivity to rise in sea
 

00:48:45.500 --> 00:48:46.900
affect their sensitivity to rise in sea
level and other things and bad weather

00:48:46.900 --> 00:48:46.910
level and other things and bad weather
 

00:48:46.910 --> 00:48:50.740
level and other things and bad weather
it's true again it seems to me to be a

00:48:50.740 --> 00:48:50.750
it's true again it seems to me to be a
 

00:48:50.750 --> 00:48:52.180
it's true again it seems to me to be a
circle order to the civet II of the

00:48:52.180 --> 00:48:52.190
circle order to the civet II of the
 

00:48:52.190 --> 00:48:54.700
circle order to the civet II of the
storm themselves okay again sandy Polly

00:48:54.700 --> 00:48:54.710
storm themselves okay again sandy Polly
 

00:48:54.710 --> 00:48:56.500
storm themselves okay again sandy Polly
would go over any kind of score reef and

00:48:56.500 --> 00:48:56.510
would go over any kind of score reef and
 

00:48:56.510 --> 00:48:58.120
would go over any kind of score reef and
destroy lots of people like you see my

00:48:58.120 --> 00:48:58.130
destroy lots of people like you see my
 

00:48:58.130 --> 00:48:59.380
destroy lots of people like you see my
point i'm not i'm not saying that those

00:48:59.380 --> 00:48:59.390
point i'm not i'm not saying that those
 

00:48:59.390 --> 00:49:01.470
point i'm not i'm not saying that those
things don't exist try to argue for a

00:49:01.470 --> 00:49:01.480
things don't exist try to argue for a
 

00:49:01.480 --> 00:49:04.030
things don't exist try to argue for a
relative importance to human beings

00:49:04.030 --> 00:49:04.040
relative importance to human beings
 

00:49:04.040 --> 00:49:06.040
relative importance to human beings
that's all I'm saying okay yes this

00:49:06.040 --> 00:49:06.050
that's all I'm saying okay yes this
 

00:49:06.050 --> 00:49:08.320
that's all I'm saying okay yes this
affects cannot care okay but I think the

00:49:08.320 --> 00:49:08.330
affects cannot care okay but I think the
 

00:49:08.330 --> 00:49:11.380
affects cannot care okay but I think the
secondary to other effects yeah I said

00:49:11.380 --> 00:49:11.390
secondary to other effects yeah I said
 

00:49:11.390 --> 00:49:13.090
secondary to other effects yeah I said
sandy would have gone even if you're a

00:49:13.090 --> 00:49:13.100
sandy would have gone even if you're a
 

00:49:13.100 --> 00:49:15.310
sandy would have gone even if you're a
beautiful coral reef all over New Jersey

00:49:15.310 --> 00:49:15.320
beautiful coral reef all over New Jersey
 

00:49:15.320 --> 00:49:18.609
beautiful coral reef all over New Jersey
and Long Island and everything alright

00:49:18.609 --> 00:49:18.619
and Long Island and everything alright
 

00:49:18.619 --> 00:49:21.710
and Long Island and everything alright
in know right it you're the question

00:49:21.710 --> 00:49:21.720
in know right it you're the question
 

00:49:21.720 --> 00:49:25.490
in know right it you're the question
question as with as with mangrove swamps

00:49:25.490 --> 00:49:25.500
question as with as with mangrove swamps
 

00:49:25.500 --> 00:49:28.270
question as with as with mangrove swamps
coral reefs are the base of a lot of

00:49:28.270 --> 00:49:28.280
coral reefs are the base of a lot of
 

00:49:28.280 --> 00:49:31.790
coral reefs are the base of a lot of
ecosystems yes and so if in fact we see

00:49:31.790 --> 00:49:31.800
ecosystems yes and so if in fact we see
 

00:49:31.800 --> 00:49:34.130
ecosystems yes and so if in fact we see
a significant decline in coral reefs any

00:49:34.130 --> 00:49:34.140
a significant decline in coral reefs any
 

00:49:34.140 --> 00:49:36.140
a significant decline in coral reefs any
thought on the consequences for the

00:49:36.140 --> 00:49:36.150
thought on the consequences for the
 

00:49:36.150 --> 00:49:40.400
thought on the consequences for the
oceanic ecosystems that are you're

00:49:40.400 --> 00:49:40.410
oceanic ecosystems that are you're
 

00:49:40.410 --> 00:49:42.470
oceanic ecosystems that are you're
getting way out of my specialty i think

00:49:42.470 --> 00:49:42.480
getting way out of my specialty i think
 

00:49:42.480 --> 00:49:43.520
getting way out of my specialty i think
in deal they are very interesting

00:49:43.520 --> 00:49:43.530
in deal they are very interesting
 

00:49:43.530 --> 00:49:45.200
in deal they are very interesting
ecosystem on coral reefs and mangroves

00:49:45.200 --> 00:49:45.210
ecosystem on coral reefs and mangroves
 

00:49:45.210 --> 00:49:47.150
ecosystem on coral reefs and mangroves
and so forth and I'm not a specialist I

00:49:47.150 --> 00:49:47.160
and so forth and I'm not a specialist I
 

00:49:47.160 --> 00:49:48.980
and so forth and I'm not a specialist I
I thought they were all going to

00:49:48.980 --> 00:49:48.990
I thought they were all going to
 

00:49:48.990 --> 00:49:50.660
I thought they were all going to
disappear by the way it's very unlikely

00:49:50.660 --> 00:49:50.670
disappear by the way it's very unlikely
 

00:49:50.670 --> 00:49:52.700
disappear by the way it's very unlikely
but that there will be a decrease in

00:49:52.700 --> 00:49:52.710
but that there will be a decrease in
 

00:49:52.710 --> 00:49:55.000
but that there will be a decrease in
those yes and where is a good question

00:49:55.000 --> 00:49:55.010
those yes and where is a good question
 

00:49:55.010 --> 00:49:57.349
those yes and where is a good question
places like the MU de which applies call

00:49:57.349 --> 00:49:57.359
places like the MU de which applies call
 

00:49:57.359 --> 00:49:58.940
places like the MU de which applies call
rates are pretty far north for coral

00:49:58.940 --> 00:49:58.950
rates are pretty far north for coral
 

00:49:58.950 --> 00:50:01.190
rates are pretty far north for coral
reef those may survive very nicely those

00:50:01.190 --> 00:50:01.200
reef those may survive very nicely those
 

00:50:01.200 --> 00:50:02.900
reef those may survive very nicely those
are in warmer climate and getting warmer

00:50:02.900 --> 00:50:02.910
are in warmer climate and getting warmer
 

00:50:02.910 --> 00:50:04.670
are in warmer climate and getting warmer
make it worse i mean the temperature

00:50:04.670 --> 00:50:04.680
make it worse i mean the temperature
 

00:50:04.680 --> 00:50:06.050
make it worse i mean the temperature
effects by much important than a

00:50:06.050 --> 00:50:06.060
effects by much important than a
 

00:50:06.060 --> 00:50:08.660
effects by much important than a
acidification so you know the Great

00:50:08.660 --> 00:50:08.670
acidification so you know the Great
 

00:50:08.670 --> 00:50:12.560
acidification so you know the Great
Barrier Reef I don't know I frankly I

00:50:12.560 --> 00:50:12.570
Barrier Reef I don't know I frankly I
 

00:50:12.570 --> 00:50:13.940
Barrier Reef I don't know I frankly I
don't know the answer yes it's a very

00:50:13.940 --> 00:50:13.950
don't know the answer yes it's a very
 

00:50:13.950 --> 00:50:15.530
don't know the answer yes it's a very
interesting ecosystem and people are

00:50:15.530 --> 00:50:15.540
interesting ecosystem and people are
 

00:50:15.540 --> 00:50:17.750
interesting ecosystem and people are
padlet I should tell you of the people

00:50:17.750 --> 00:50:17.760
padlet I should tell you of the people
 

00:50:17.760 --> 00:50:19.280
padlet I should tell you of the people
working in that field those who have

00:50:19.280 --> 00:50:19.290
working in that field those who have
 

00:50:19.290 --> 00:50:21.740
working in that field those who have
most emotion about the subject of the

00:50:21.740 --> 00:50:21.750
most emotion about the subject of the
 

00:50:21.750 --> 00:50:23.900
most emotion about the subject of the
coal people they have great amount of

00:50:23.900 --> 00:50:23.910
coal people they have great amount of
 

00:50:23.910 --> 00:50:26.300
coal people they have great amount of
attachment to the systems and they are

00:50:26.300 --> 00:50:26.310
attachment to the systems and they are
 

00:50:26.310 --> 00:50:29.329
attachment to the systems and they are
as a result much more a panicky but at

00:50:29.329 --> 00:50:29.339
as a result much more a panicky but at
 

00:50:29.339 --> 00:50:31.190
as a result much more a panicky but at
least emotionally attached to you to the

00:50:31.190 --> 00:50:31.200
least emotionally attached to you to the
 

00:50:31.200 --> 00:50:33.320
least emotionally attached to you to the
ocean acidification as a problem and for

00:50:33.320 --> 00:50:33.330
ocean acidification as a problem and for
 

00:50:33.330 --> 00:50:35.030
ocean acidification as a problem and for
good reasons okay but I think from a

00:50:35.030 --> 00:50:35.040
good reasons okay but I think from a
 

00:50:35.040 --> 00:50:37.339
good reasons okay but I think from a
societal point of view it's again less

00:50:37.339 --> 00:50:37.349
societal point of view it's again less
 

00:50:37.349 --> 00:50:39.800
societal point of view it's again less
than that I think that's see my point

00:50:39.800 --> 00:50:39.810
than that I think that's see my point
 

00:50:39.810 --> 00:50:42.920
than that I think that's see my point
right and that boo yes a lot cooperates

00:50:42.920 --> 00:50:42.930
right and that boo yes a lot cooperates
 

00:50:42.930 --> 00:50:44.839
right and that boo yes a lot cooperates
I like diving so there's good reason to

00:50:44.839 --> 00:50:44.849
I like diving so there's good reason to
 

00:50:44.849 --> 00:50:54.180
I like diving so there's good reason to
go there thank you for

00:50:54.180 --> 00:50:54.190
 
 

00:50:54.190 --> 00:50:57.060
 
thank you
