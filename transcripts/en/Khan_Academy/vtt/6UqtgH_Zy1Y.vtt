00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:02.530
We've already talked
about the process

00:00:02.530 --> 00:00:06.970
from going from DNA
to messenger RNA.

00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:09.160
And we call that
process transcription.

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:13.180
And this occurs in the nucleus.

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:16.390
And then that messenger
RNA makes its way outside

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:20.250
of the nucleus, and it
attaches to a ribosome.

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:23.745
And then it is translated
into a protein.

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:31.100
And so you could say that
this part right over here,

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:33.250
this is being facilitated
by a ribosome.

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:36.100
Or it's happening at a ribosome.

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:38.110
With that high-level
overview, I now

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:41.220
want to think a little bit
in more detail about how this

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:44.210
actually happens, or the
structure of things where

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:47.160
this happens inside of a cell.

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.240
And so I'm going to now draw
the nucleus in a little bit more

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:52.470
detail so that we
can really see what's

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:54.530
happening on its membrane.

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:58.640
So this right over
here is the nucleus.

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:01.710
Actually, let me
draw it like this.

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:05.740
And instead of just drawing the
nucleus with one single line,

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:07.850
I'm going to draw
it with two lines.

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:12.550
Because it's actually a
double bilipid membrane.

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:15.700
So this is one bilipid
layer right over here.

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:18.950
And then this is another
one right over here.

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:21.090
And I'm obviously not
drawing it to scale.

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.500
I'm drawing it so you can
get a sense of things.

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:26.410
So each of these lines
that I'm drawing,

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:29.930
if I were to zoom in on this--
so if I were to zoom in on each

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:32.360
of these lines,
so let's zoom in.

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:38.380
And if I got a box like that,
you would see a bilipid layer.

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:43.860
So a bilipid layer
looks like this.

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.280
You have the circle
is a hydrophilic end

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:50.800
and those lines are the
fatty hydrophobic ends.

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:52.330
So that's our bilipid layer.

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:56.720
So that's each of these lines
that I have drawn, each of them

00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:59.320
are a bilipid layer.

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:02.460
So the question is, well,
how does the mRNA-- obviously

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:04.900
you have all this
transcription going on.

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:06.840
You have the DNA,
you have the mRNA.

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:09.470
It's all in here,
this big jumble

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:12.250
of chromatin inside the nucleus.

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:19.640
How does it make its way outside
of this double bilipid layer?

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:24.000
And the way it makes its way
out is through nuclear pores.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.960
So a nuclear pore is
essentially a tunnel.

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:30.550
And there are
thousands of these.

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:34.040
It's a tunnel through
this bilipid layer.

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:37.224
So the tunnel is made up
of a bunch of proteins.

00:02:37.224 --> 00:02:38.640
So this right over
here-- and this

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:40.200
is kind of a cross
section of it.

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:42.070
But you could almost
imagine it if you're

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:43.600
thinking of it in
three dimensions,

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:45.310
you would imagine a tunnel.

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:47.610
A protein-constructed--
a tunnel made out

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:55.880
of proteins that goes through
this double bilipid membrane.

00:02:55.880 --> 00:03:06.970
And so the mRNA can make its way
out and get to a free ribosome,

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:10.425
and then be translated
into a protein.

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:17.500
But this right over here is
not the complete picture.

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:22.340
Because when you translate a
protein using a free ribosome,

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:25.560
this is for proteins that
are used inside the cell.

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:30.330
So let me draw the entire
cell right over here.

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:32.110
This is the cell.

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:36.950
This right over here is
the cytosol of the cell.

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:38.490
And you might be
sometimes confused

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:41.540
with the term cytosol
and cytoplasm.

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:44.860
Cytosol is all the fluid
between the organelles.

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:47.860
Cytoplasm is everything
that's inside the cell.

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:50.520
So it's the cytosol
and the organelles

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:53.760
and the stuff inside the
organelles is the cytoplasm.

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:56.650
So cytoplasm is everything
inside of the cell.

00:03:56.650 --> 00:04:01.890
Cytosol is just the fluid
that's between the organelles.

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:05.910
So anyway, the free ribosome
over here, this translation

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:09.380
is good for proteins used
within the cell itself.

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:12.060
The proteins can then
float around the cytosol

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:14.160
and used in whichever
way is appropriate.

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:17.600
But how do you get protein
outside of the cell,

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:20.089
or even inside the
cellular membrane?

00:04:20.089 --> 00:04:22.600
Not within it, within
the cell, but embedded

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:25.440
in the cell membrane or
outside of the cell itself.

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:26.880
And we know that
cells communicate

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:29.250
in all sorts of different
ways and they produce proteins

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:31.190
for other cells or for
use in the bloodstream,

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:33.070
or whatever it might be.

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:35.710
And that's what we're going
to focus on in this video.

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:39.960
So contiguous with this
what's called a perinuclear

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:42.380
space right over here, so
the space between these two

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:45.910
membranes-- So you have
this perinuclear space

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:48.642
between the inner and
outer nuclear membrane.

00:04:48.642 --> 00:04:49.600
Let me just label that.

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:52.220
That's the inner
nuclear membrane.

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:55.450
That's the outer
nuclear membrane.

00:04:55.450 --> 00:04:59.570
You could continue this
outer nuclear membrane,

00:04:59.570 --> 00:05:05.870
and you get into these kind
of flaps and folds and bulges.

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:08.140
And this right over
here is considered

00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:10.250
a separate organelle.

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:12.750
So you get this thing
that looks like this,

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:16.030
and I'll just do it the
best that I can draw it.

00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:17.450
And this right
over here is called

00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:20.110
the endoplasmic reticulum.

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:26.130
So this right here is
endoplasmic reticulum,

00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:30.210
which I've always thought would
be a good name for a band.

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:35.050
And the endoplasmic
reticulum is key for starting

00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:38.140
to produce and then later
on package proteins that

00:05:38.140 --> 00:05:41.850
are either embedded in
the cellular membrane

00:05:41.850 --> 00:05:45.610
or used outside of
the cell itself.

00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:47.200
So how does that happen?

00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:50.840
Well, the endoplasmic reticulum
really has two regions.

00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:53.910
It has the rough
endoplasmic reticulum.

00:05:53.910 --> 00:05:57.500
And the rough
endoplasmic reticulum

00:05:57.500 --> 00:05:59.440
has a bunch of ribosomes.

00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:01.190
So that's a free
ribosome right over here.

00:06:01.190 --> 00:06:03.840
This is an attached ribosome.

00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:06.130
These are ribosomes
that are attached

00:06:06.130 --> 00:06:10.370
to the membrane of the
endoplasmic reticulum.

00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:12.070
So this region where
you have attached

00:06:12.070 --> 00:06:16.910
ribosomes right
over here, that is

00:06:16.910 --> 00:06:20.030
the rough endoplasmic reticulum.

00:06:20.030 --> 00:06:22.270
I'll call it the
rough ER for short.

00:06:22.270 --> 00:06:25.077
Perhaps an even better
name for a band.

00:06:25.077 --> 00:06:26.660
And then there's
another region, which

00:06:26.660 --> 00:06:29.360
is the smooth
endoplasmic reticulum.

00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:33.100
And the role that this
plays in protein synthesis,

00:06:33.100 --> 00:06:35.310
or at least getting proteins
ready for the outside

00:06:35.310 --> 00:06:41.140
of the cell, is you can
have messenger RNA-- let

00:06:41.140 --> 00:06:43.420
me do that in that
lighter green color--

00:06:43.420 --> 00:06:46.770
you can have
messenger RNA find one

00:06:46.770 --> 00:06:50.020
of these ribosomes associated
with the rough endoplasmic

00:06:50.020 --> 00:06:51.030
reticulum.

00:06:51.030 --> 00:06:53.550
And as the protein
is translated,

00:06:53.550 --> 00:06:56.550
it won't be translated
inside the cytosol.

00:06:56.550 --> 00:06:58.930
It'll be translated
on the other side

00:06:58.930 --> 00:07:02.610
of the rough
endoplasmic reticulum.

00:07:02.610 --> 00:07:05.780
Or you could say on
the inside of it,

00:07:05.780 --> 00:07:10.252
in the lumen of the rough
endoplasmic reticulum.

00:07:10.252 --> 00:07:11.710
Let me make that
a little bit-- let

00:07:11.710 --> 00:07:13.440
me draw that a
little bit better.

00:07:13.440 --> 00:07:16.480
So let's say that this right
over here, that right over here

00:07:16.480 --> 00:07:19.870
is the membrane of the
endoplasmic reticulum.

00:07:19.870 --> 00:07:23.490
And then as a
protein, or as a mRNA

00:07:23.490 --> 00:07:26.430
is being translated
into protein,

00:07:26.430 --> 00:07:29.260
the ribosome can attach.

00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:34.370
And let's say that
this right over here

00:07:34.370 --> 00:07:37.530
is the mRNA that is
being translated.

00:07:37.530 --> 00:07:40.800
Let's say it's going in that
direction right over here.

00:07:40.800 --> 00:07:43.490
Here is the membrane of the ER.

00:07:43.490 --> 00:07:45.615
So ER membrane.

00:07:49.240 --> 00:07:51.960
This right over here-- and
actually, the way I've drawn it

00:07:51.960 --> 00:07:54.430
right over here, this is
just one bilipid layer.

00:07:54.430 --> 00:07:57.170
So let me just
draw it like this.

00:07:57.170 --> 00:07:59.230
I could do it like this.

00:07:59.230 --> 00:08:02.220
And this is actually, this
bilipid layer is continuous.

00:08:02.220 --> 00:08:06.485
It's continuous with the
outer nuclear membrane.

00:08:06.485 --> 00:08:11.030
So let me just make it like
that so you get the picture.

00:08:11.030 --> 00:08:16.030
And then at some point in
the translation process,

00:08:16.030 --> 00:08:21.080
the protein can be
spit out on the inside.

00:08:21.080 --> 00:08:24.110
As it's being translated,
it can be spit out

00:08:24.110 --> 00:08:27.350
on the inside of the
endoplasmic reticulum.

00:08:27.350 --> 00:08:29.610
So this is the lumen.

00:08:29.610 --> 00:08:31.800
This is the ER lumen
right over here.

00:08:31.800 --> 00:08:35.159
So we're inside the
endoplasmic reticulum here.

00:08:35.159 --> 00:08:40.390
Here we're outside
in the cytosol.

00:08:46.010 --> 00:08:49.780
So that way you get the
protein now, inside the ER.

00:08:49.780 --> 00:08:51.350
Inside the
endoplasmic reticulum,

00:08:51.350 --> 00:08:53.090
and it can travel through it.

00:08:53.090 --> 00:08:55.270
And at some point,
it can bud off.

00:08:55.270 --> 00:08:58.190
So let's say, imagine the
protein is right over here.

00:08:58.190 --> 00:09:01.600
And the smooth endoplasmic
reticulum has many functions,

00:09:01.600 --> 00:09:06.270
and I won't get into all the
depth of how it's involved.

00:09:06.270 --> 00:09:09.590
But at some point that
protein can bud off.

00:09:09.590 --> 00:09:12.260
So let me draw a
budding off protein.

00:09:12.260 --> 00:09:16.270
So let's say this
is the membrane

00:09:16.270 --> 00:09:18.700
of the endoplasmic reticulum.

00:09:18.700 --> 00:09:25.200
And a protein, let's say,
ends up right over here.

00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:26.580
And then it can bud out.

00:09:26.580 --> 00:09:30.660
So it could go from that to--
let me do that same color.

00:09:30.660 --> 00:09:36.975
It could go from
that to that-- I

00:09:36.975 --> 00:09:42.276
think you see where this is
going-- to that, and then

00:09:42.276 --> 00:09:43.720
to that.

00:09:43.720 --> 00:09:47.920
And then it could go
to something like this.

00:09:47.920 --> 00:09:50.240
Now it has budded out.

00:09:50.240 --> 00:09:53.160
And when you have a
protein, or really you

00:09:53.160 --> 00:09:54.960
have anything that's
being transported

00:09:54.960 --> 00:09:59.320
around a cell with its
own little mini membrane,

00:09:59.320 --> 00:10:01.130
we call this a vesicle.

00:10:01.130 --> 00:10:05.620
So now it'll bundle up,
and now it is a vesicle.

00:10:05.620 --> 00:10:07.500
Now, this vesicle
can then-- let me

00:10:07.500 --> 00:10:11.950
draw some of these vesicles
holding some proteins, so

00:10:11.950 --> 00:10:20.240
let me draw that-- can then go
to the Golgi apparatus, which

00:10:20.240 --> 00:10:23.670
I'll drawn in blue right
over here as best as I can.

00:10:23.670 --> 00:10:26.420
So the Golgi apparatus.

00:10:26.420 --> 00:10:28.460
This is not--
obviously there could

00:10:28.460 --> 00:10:31.610
be better drawings of
something like this.

00:10:31.610 --> 00:10:34.340
And then they can essentially
do the reverse process,

00:10:34.340 --> 00:10:37.600
and they can attach themselves
to the Golgi, oftentimes

00:10:37.600 --> 00:10:41.330
the Golgi body, named after
Mr. Golgi who discovered this.

00:10:41.330 --> 00:10:43.790
And then the proteins,
once they get

00:10:43.790 --> 00:10:47.150
into the inside
of the Golgi body,

00:10:47.150 --> 00:10:50.800
then they essentially go
into a maturation process

00:10:50.800 --> 00:10:53.710
so that they're ready for
transport outside of the cell,

00:10:53.710 --> 00:10:57.000
or maybe to be embedded
into the cellular membrane.

00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:59.140
So this right over
here is the Golgi body,

00:10:59.140 --> 00:11:01.115
or a Golgi body or
Golgi apparatus.

00:11:08.480 --> 00:11:12.010
And then once they're
done with that process,

00:11:12.010 --> 00:11:16.220
then this is kind of the
fully-manufactured protein

00:11:16.220 --> 00:11:19.400
ready to be used.

00:11:19.400 --> 00:11:22.300
And actually, maybe I'll make
it a slightly different-- well,

00:11:22.300 --> 00:11:23.740
I'll just use that same color.

00:11:23.740 --> 00:11:25.960
This is the
fully-manufactured protein.

00:11:25.960 --> 00:11:30.250
And now it can transport
to the cell membrane.

00:11:30.250 --> 00:11:33.390
And that protein can
either be transported

00:11:33.390 --> 00:11:36.060
outside of the
cell, or it can be

00:11:36.060 --> 00:11:39.395
embedded within the
membrane itself.
