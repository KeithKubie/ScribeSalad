00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.080
For this main video,

00:00:01.080 --> 00:00:03.380
it's worth saying explicitly at the start

00:00:03.380 --> 00:00:05.380
that the obvious actual goal

00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:07.380
is to achieve happiness,

00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:08.380
not misery.

00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:09.560
But you, like me,

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:11.560
might find the advice on happiness

00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:13.080
kind of tiresome.

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:14.420
Almost irritating.

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:16.480
So it might be more useful to think

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:18.660
about how to achieve the opposite.

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:20.820
And thus, to see how the actions we might

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:22.660
take work against us.

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:24.660
And happiness is a topic that is

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:27.360
unusually well-suited to this mental inversion.

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:28.500
My dear viewers,

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:31.180
do not take the main video as literal advice.

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:33.820
I want all of you to find your own happiness.

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:35.820
And that's why I made this video.

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:37.700
Good luck.

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:44.400
Why are you still here?
