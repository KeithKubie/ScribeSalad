00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:04.480
Dear physics, will we ever be able to run
from one cliff to another like I saw in the

00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:05.580
cartoons?

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:14.680
Asking for a friend.

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:16.880
Cartoon physics is the best.

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:21.859
If I run fast enough I can run off a cliff,
strapping a rocket to my back is fun, and

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:23.490
slipping on bananas is easy to do.

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:27.380
To be honest, we know the first won't work,
and strapping a rocket to your back pretty

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:29.830
much describes science in the 1950s.

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:34.520
But the science of the venerable banana peel,
was elusive, until now.

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:39.570
The Ig Nobel awards are given out every year
to research that QUOTE "first makes people

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:42.850
laugh, and then makes them think," according
to their website.

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:47.640
This year, the Ig Nobel prize in physics was
given to peeps from Kitasato University in

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:52.100
Japan for determining the exact coefficient[a]
of friction for the banana peel, and what

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:54.400
causes the slickness.

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:58.830
According to their findings, the frictional
coefficient of a banana on linoleum was about

00:00:58.830 --> 00:00:59.830
0.07.

00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:07.469
By comparison, skin on metal is between point-8
and 1.0 -- lower numbers are more slick.

00:01:07.469 --> 00:01:14.039
It's comparable to a lubricated surface, Non-stick
teflon is around point zero four, and a wet

00:01:14.039 --> 00:01:18.350
road is still point 2 -- positively rough!

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:24.240
The researchers also determined, by microscopic
observation, the slippery nature comes from

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:27.469
a polysaccharide follicular gel on the banana
skin.

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:31.429
But before you start commenting about why
people are wasting their money studying this

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:34.579
stuff, how about some things that hit closer
to home!

00:01:34.579 --> 00:01:35.579
I am clumsy.

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:36.750
I drop stuff.

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:39.030
Why do you think we did the 5 second rule
video?!

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:45.049
[b] Science has finally found out why toast
always lands butter-side down!

00:01:45.049 --> 00:01:50.829
Using a toast analog, to best model the behavior
of bread -- students at Thiel College, found

00:01:50.829 --> 00:01:55.109
that toast would land butter-side down 63-percent
of the time.

00:01:55.109 --> 00:01:56.520
Which is, bad.

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:57.520
Why?

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:01.469
It's pretty complicated, but essentially,
the angular momentum of a piece of toast is

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:06.380
related to the angle at which it leaves a
surface -- i.e. a hand or a table.

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:10.960
When the toast tumbles, these angles determine
whether the butter-side is up or down.

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:15.440
If you want to limit the butter-fails make
sure your toast is more than 270 degrees or

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:17.820
less than 90 when it begins its fall.

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:22.100
Science has also explored the most polarizing
leaf ever eaten.

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:23.100
Cilantro.

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:26.770
In 2012, a genetic survey was done on 30,000
people of European ancestry.

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:30.700
And they found genes that affect olfactory
receptors in the nose.

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:35.620
A gene called OR6A2 encodes a receptor that
binds to a fat molecule fragment called an

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:36.620
aldehyde.

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:42.270
People with this binding will get a strong
emotional reaction, probably due to an evolved

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:48.560
connection between food smell and flavor!

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:55.010
In a University of Toronto survey, people
who have descendents from East Asia will hate

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:57.720
cilantro the most, then Europe, then Africa.

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:02.030
The least hate came from those of Middle Eastern
descent -- where, unsurprisingly, is where

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:03.970
cilantro originated.

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:04.970
What about you?

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:05.970
Do you hate cilantro?

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:09.190
Have you ever actually SEEN anyone slip on
a banana?

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:45.170
What food science do you want 

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:53.800
to know next?
