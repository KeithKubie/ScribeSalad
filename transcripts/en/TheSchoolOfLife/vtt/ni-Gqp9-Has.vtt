00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:05.160
It's normal to expect that 
we're always going to,

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:06.380
almost by nature,

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:08.380
actively seek out our own happiness.

00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:12.200
Especially in two big areas 
of potential satisfaction:

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:13.980
relationships and careers.

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:16.680
So it's odd and 
not a little unnerving

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:19.720
to discover just how often 
some of us appear to act

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:23.720
as if we were, deliberately, 
out to ruin our chances

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:27.360
of getting what we are, on the surface
convinced, that we're really after

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:30.680
When going on dates with 
candidates we like the sound of,

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:33.520
we may suddenly lapse 
into unnecessary opinionated

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:35.440
or antagonistic behaviour.

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:36.280
"Hello."

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:38.840
"Hi, Ellen, what're you doing friday night?"

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:39.960
"Yes?"

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:41.140
"Yes?"

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:42.960
"Who is this?"

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.120
"Why, it's Bill, Bill Jenkins."

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:48.060
"Narrator: So Bill didn't do very well."

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:51.560
When we have no difficulty being 
charming with the type we aren't so keen on,

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:55.560
Or, in relationships, we may 
drive our partners to distraction

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:58.020
through repeated, 
unwarranted accusations

00:00:58.020 --> 00:00:59.800
or angry explosions.

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:03.720
As if we were somehow willing to 
bring on the sad day when,

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:07.300
exhausted and frustrated, our loved ones
would be forced to walk away.

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:10.680
Still sympathetic, but unable 
to take so much drama.

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:14.740
And similarly, we could destroy 
our chances of promotion at work

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:17.540
when, out of the blue, 
after lots of promising years

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:20.140
we get strident with our managers

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:24.400
or, on several occasions, fail to hand in
really important reports in time for meetings.

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:28.640
Such behavior can't be 
explained away as mere bad luck.

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:31.720
It deserves a stronger, more intentional term.

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:34.500
This is self-sabotage.

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.540
What could possibly explain 
such destructiveness?

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:42.840
In large part, how plain ennerving
happiness can sometimes feel to us.

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:46.040
Though happiness is, of course, 
what we all fundamentally want,

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:49.220
for many of us, it isn't really
 what we know.

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:51.620
We grew up in and 
learned to make our peace with

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:53.500
far darker scenarios.

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:56.480
The prospect of hapiness
when it in the end appears

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:59.340
can, therefore, seem
a bit counter intuitive

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:01.180
and not a little bit
frightening.

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:02.780
It isn't what we've come to expect.

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:04.960
And it doesn't feel like home.

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:09.260
We may prefer to choose what's
comfortingly familiar, even if it's difficult,

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:13.160
over what is alienatingly
fulfilling or good.

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:16.660
Getting what we want can feel
unbearably risky.

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:19.020
It puts us at the mercy of fate.

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:23.940
We open ourselves up to hope 
and subsequent possibility of loss.

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:29.960
Self-sabotage may leave us sad
but at least safely, blessedly, in control.

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:34.000
It can be useful to keep the 
concept of self sabotage in mind

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:37.620
when interpreting our and others
odder behaviour.

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:39.520
We should start to get suspicious

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:43.220
when we catch ourselves 
pulling off erratic perfomances

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:47.420
around people we deep down
really like or need to impress.

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:51.900
Furthermore, faced with certain kinds
of viciousness and unreliability in others,

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:56.700
we should dare to imagine the things 
are perhaps not quite as they seem.

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:00.620
We might have on our hands 
not a nasty, malevolent opponent,

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:04.020
but an almost touchingly 
wounded self saboter,

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:06.640
who chiefly deserves 
a little patience

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:10.700
and should gently be coaxed
out of doing themselves further harm.

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:14.020
We should come to terms with
and help others to see

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:17.400
just how hard and unnerving
it can sometimes be

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:21.520
to get close to some of 
the things we truly want.
