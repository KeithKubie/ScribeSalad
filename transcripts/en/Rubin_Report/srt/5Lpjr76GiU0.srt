00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:07,920
joining me today is the host of
the relatable podcast, a speaker,

3
00:00:07,930 --> 00:00:12,090
a commentator at a cat person, Allie
Stuckey. Welcome to the Rubin report.

4
00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:14,220
Thank you for having
me. All right, Stuckey.

5
00:00:14,221 --> 00:00:17,430
I have wanted you in the studio
for quite some time to be here.

6
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:19,260
It is good to have you here,
but we got,

7
00:00:19,261 --> 00:00:23,920
I got two bones to pick before we do
anything have to do with cats. Number one,

8
00:00:23,950 --> 00:00:28,920
you're a cat person. What's going on? You
just met my dog about, she says, sweet.

9
00:00:28,940 --> 00:00:33,930
I love dogs. I have a dog. She's a
rescue. I have two cats. Cats are just,

10
00:00:34,230 --> 00:00:37,530
they're cool and they're easy.
They don't need that much of your time,

11
00:00:37,531 --> 00:00:38,610
that much of your attention.

12
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:43,200
I travel a lot like you do and so it's
nice to just be able to leave the cats,

13
00:00:43,201 --> 00:00:46,560
but you got to put a dog in a Kennel.
You got to pay a bunch of money.

14
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:48,870
They need your time. They need your
attention. They need to go outside.

15
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:52,320
Cats are cool. They don't really want to
hang out with your plotting to kill you.

16
00:00:52,321 --> 00:00:56,130
Most of the Times you're looking at
you that they could lunge at you at any

17
00:00:56,131 --> 00:00:59,840
moment. Oh, that's a stereotype that I
week expect someone on the left to me,

18
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:02,160
but that's,
it's not true.

19
00:01:02,161 --> 00:01:06,960
You have to take cats by their individual
personalities and not categorize them.

20
00:01:07,410 --> 00:01:11,610
Look at how you just used identity
politics against me just right. Right.

21
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:14,940
It applies to the animal kingdom to,
I just needed you to know. All right.

22
00:01:14,941 --> 00:01:18,570
That's number one. Okay. Just going
to have to agree to disagree and dogs.

23
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:23,870
Number two for about two years I
had the number one Prager u video.

24
00:01:24,170 --> 00:01:28,110
Oh, I left the left. Sorry.
Then you came in there.

25
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:29,640
You took number one away from me,

26
00:01:29,641 --> 00:01:32,200
but actually I don't know if
you know this as of the last,

27
00:01:32,201 --> 00:01:35,880
cause you could see somebody else took
number one. I don't, I'm not even,

28
00:01:35,881 --> 00:01:39,090
so we need to get them in here and now
we have a bone to pick with them. Yeah.

29
00:01:39,091 --> 00:01:41,350
I actually can't remember who was,
um,

30
00:01:41,610 --> 00:01:43,650
or what even the topic was
this morning and I was like,

31
00:01:43,651 --> 00:01:47,610
I don't even want to know. I don't
even want it now. But you, uh, you was,

32
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:49,870
what was the title of his masculinity?

33
00:01:49,990 --> 00:01:53,550
I think it was like make men masculine
naked or something like that.

34
00:01:53,551 --> 00:01:57,660
So I guess that was a hot
topic that people really
wanted to hear about. I mean,

35
00:01:57,661 --> 00:02:00,690
it was so fun to make. Obviously
you've made for your, your video too,

36
00:02:00,691 --> 00:02:05,220
but I didn't really anticipate it
being one of those viral videos.

37
00:02:05,220 --> 00:02:08,670
I kind of just thought, okay, most
people in general agree with me,

38
00:02:08,671 --> 00:02:11,550
but the vitriol of course they got you.
You just,

39
00:02:11,551 --> 00:02:14,940
you're continually surprised by
some people on the laugh too,

40
00:02:14,941 --> 00:02:19,380
are so opposed to what are very
traditional ideas. So, yeah. All right,

41
00:02:19,381 --> 00:02:21,950
well we're going to talk about some of
those traditional ideas. We'll tell us,

42
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:25,500
talk about masculinity and me two and
a whole bunch of other stuff called for

43
00:02:25,501 --> 00:02:29,670
people that don't know you. Yeah. Where
did you come from? What's going on here?

44
00:02:29,730 --> 00:02:32,760
Yes. So I started in this
whole kind of political,

45
00:02:32,761 --> 00:02:35,060
I won't even say media field,

46
00:02:35,070 --> 00:02:38,460
but kind of about three
and a half years ago.

47
00:02:38,461 --> 00:02:41,160
So fall of 2015 I was working in PR,

48
00:02:41,161 --> 00:02:43,950
graduated from college in 2014 PR,

49
00:02:43,951 --> 00:02:47,070
social media just had kind
of your normal agency job.

50
00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:51,360
But in fall of 2015 I lived in
a college town, Athens, Georgia.

51
00:02:51,690 --> 00:02:54,210
And I looked around and
the friends that I had,

52
00:02:54,211 --> 00:02:57,630
both in college and out of college had no
idea what was going on in the election.

53
00:02:57,631 --> 00:02:58,590
It was the primaries.

54
00:02:58,591 --> 00:03:03,340
And I thought these are really smart
people and a lot of them are conservative

55
00:03:03,341 --> 00:03:07,750
in their values and yet they seem to be
touting these progressive use when it

56
00:03:07,751 --> 00:03:10,570
comes to politics and they really
have no idea what's going on.

57
00:03:10,571 --> 00:03:12,250
And so I really just kind of had a,

58
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:16,390
a random idea when I was driving one
day called my mom and I said, you know,

59
00:03:16,391 --> 00:03:19,840
I think I want to tell sorority girls
why they should vote in the primaries

60
00:03:20,020 --> 00:03:23,290
because they seem so apathetic.
I feel like I can talk to this crap.

61
00:03:23,291 --> 00:03:27,670
Cause I was a story a girl about a year
before that. And so I created this,

62
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:32,170
it really was a nonpartisan
presentation, um, for,

63
00:03:32,230 --> 00:03:34,990
for college students for why they
should vote in the primaries.

64
00:03:34,990 --> 00:03:39,610
And I started reaching out to add the
sorority presidents and you can find that

65
00:03:39,611 --> 00:03:42,700
information online. I just said, can I
please come? I want to speak for free.

66
00:03:42,701 --> 00:03:43,920
It's going to be nonpartisan.

67
00:03:43,930 --> 00:03:47,710
I just want to tell you guys
why you should vote in the
primaries. And it worked.

68
00:03:47,711 --> 00:03:47,951
I mean,

69
00:03:47,951 --> 00:03:51,490
I started speaking to some of these
groups and then I started getting asked by

70
00:03:51,491 --> 00:03:54,760
other organizations on and
off campus, uh, to come speak.

71
00:03:54,761 --> 00:03:58,510
And then from that I started a blog
and that was called the conservative

72
00:03:58,511 --> 00:04:01,390
millennial ditch,
the nonpartisan thing pretty quickly.

73
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:04,690
And then after a few months of doing that,

74
00:04:04,691 --> 00:04:07,000
I started making videos and
that's kind of what it took off.

75
00:04:07,001 --> 00:04:12,001
So end of 2016 beginning of 2017 is when
it probably officially became a career,

76
00:04:13,451 --> 00:04:17,740
started working at the blaze. And
then that changed to, I moved to CRTV.

77
00:04:17,741 --> 00:04:19,270
That's where I started my podcast.

78
00:04:19,271 --> 00:04:23,440
And that was the beginning of 28 team.
Yes.

79
00:04:23,441 --> 00:04:26,680
I'm getting my years confused. Beginning
of 2018 that I started the podcast,

80
00:04:26,681 --> 00:04:30,670
so still speak, still
commentate. Um, I still write,

81
00:04:30,671 --> 00:04:33,400
I still do a lot of the same things I
was doing three and a half years ago.

82
00:04:33,401 --> 00:04:35,650
It's just evolved into a full time thing.

83
00:04:35,790 --> 00:04:37,050
Yeah,
it's pretty sweet.

84
00:04:37,051 --> 00:04:40,630
When you start doing something and next
thing you know it becomes something

85
00:04:40,631 --> 00:04:42,840
becomes up. Right, right. Yeah. Not Bad.

86
00:04:43,410 --> 00:04:45,570
Do you come from a political
family or anything?

87
00:04:45,571 --> 00:04:48,540
Did you care about politics before this
or was that just your wake up when you

88
00:04:48,541 --> 00:04:51,150
realize nobody knows what
they're talking about? A college?

89
00:04:51,230 --> 00:04:55,340
I would say both ant mostly.
Mostly the second one I grew up in,

90
00:04:55,850 --> 00:04:57,620
I wouldn't say it was an a political home.

91
00:04:57,621 --> 00:05:00,970
I knew we were conservatives
and I knew we liked the,

92
00:05:00,990 --> 00:05:03,680
the earliest president that I
really remember as George W. Bush,

93
00:05:03,681 --> 00:05:07,550
and I was really young during nine 11
and I remember the patriotism that my

94
00:05:07,551 --> 00:05:11,450
parents showed and that we were supposed
to show that I knew we were supporting

95
00:05:11,451 --> 00:05:15,140
George W. Bush. And we kind of grew
up watching Fox News, but politics,

96
00:05:15,170 --> 00:05:18,860
it wasn't a discussion that we had
at the dinner table necessarily.

97
00:05:18,861 --> 00:05:22,640
I just knew the values that we had.
My parents were entrepreneurs.

98
00:05:22,641 --> 00:05:25,130
They came from very poor
families in Arkansas.

99
00:05:25,430 --> 00:05:27,050
They had no money when they got married.

100
00:05:27,051 --> 00:05:32,051
They were 19 and 20 and they really went
from nothing and then build a business

101
00:05:32,511 --> 00:05:34,820
and built a life for my brothers.
And for me,

102
00:05:34,821 --> 00:05:36,740
that was so much better
than the ones that they had.

103
00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:41,870
And so the idea of freedom
of entrepreneurship,

104
00:05:41,871 --> 00:05:46,010
of not having a cap on your potential
was just always really attractive to me.

105
00:05:46,011 --> 00:05:49,460
So there was never a time in college,
high school,

106
00:05:49,490 --> 00:05:52,010
even as a rebellious teenager,
that I was like, you know,

107
00:05:52,340 --> 00:05:55,720
more government control actually sounds
really good. It just, it just never,

108
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:58,400
never occurred to me that
would lead to a better life.

109
00:05:58,401 --> 00:06:01,670
I just always loved the entrepreneurial
spirit in the idea of the American dream

110
00:06:01,671 --> 00:06:02,840
that my parents embodied.

111
00:06:03,170 --> 00:06:06,380
So it was more of those values
rather than talking about politics,

112
00:06:06,381 --> 00:06:11,100
my dad did become a state representative,
um, when I was in college,

113
00:06:11,101 --> 00:06:16,040
I think it was 2012. And so yeah,
that probably spurred some interest.

114
00:06:16,041 --> 00:06:20,420
I started probably getting
a more knowledgeable and
more informed about actually

115
00:06:20,421 --> 00:06:22,760
what was going on.
But yeah,

116
00:06:22,761 --> 00:06:26,330
I would say it's more a
lifelong value building thing.

117
00:06:26,330 --> 00:06:29,480
And then by the time I graduated
college, I was like, oh my gosh,

118
00:06:29,481 --> 00:06:31,490
I feel like our nation
is kind of at a crisis.

119
00:06:31,730 --> 00:06:35,240
How does religion play a role in that?
It plays a huge, it plays a huge role.

120
00:06:35,241 --> 00:06:39,440
You know, we hear a lot, especially
from people in the lot, uh,

121
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:41,300
that you're religious,
you should have,

122
00:06:41,350 --> 00:06:44,840
have no impact on what you
believe politically. Well,

123
00:06:44,841 --> 00:06:47,780
that's just a false idea of,

124
00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:49,910
of religion and a false
idea of your faith.

125
00:06:49,930 --> 00:06:52,190
If your faith is the center of your life,

126
00:06:52,191 --> 00:06:55,340
which religious people believe that
it should be and it's going to affect

127
00:06:55,341 --> 00:06:58,040
everything,
it's going to affect all of your values.

128
00:06:58,041 --> 00:07:01,140
It's going to affect
probably how you vote. Um,

129
00:07:01,250 --> 00:07:04,880
and it's going to affect that the things
that you believe in politically and the

130
00:07:04,881 --> 00:07:09,740
way that you think that the country
should go and so be not only a born again

131
00:07:09,741 --> 00:07:12,500
Christian, but also a
Protestant Christian. Um,

132
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:16,910
having roots in even the Protestant
reformation and how that kind of affected

133
00:07:16,911 --> 00:07:20,480
the, the movement of the West towards
freedom and towards individual liberty,

134
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:25,130
I think has certainly been a legacy that
was passed down to me. And it all just,

135
00:07:25,131 --> 00:07:27,440
it all has always made sense.

136
00:07:27,441 --> 00:07:32,000
I wish I had like a better
journey story of changing my mind,

137
00:07:32,030 --> 00:07:36,440
but the idea of individual liberty and
human dignity and all of the rights that

138
00:07:36,441 --> 00:07:39,230
come with that, it just,
it just always made sense.

139
00:07:39,350 --> 00:07:43,010
The stories that come from a little more
of an evolution that they involve more

140
00:07:43,011 --> 00:07:47,300
violence and pain and anger, but there's
Tracy, they make for a good story. Yeah.

141
00:07:47,301 --> 00:07:51,500
They make for a good book. Yeah. Perhaps.
Perhaps. Maybe. I don't know. Um,

142
00:07:51,501 --> 00:07:54,680
so when you got into the online
world and started posting videos,

143
00:07:54,890 --> 00:07:56,840
podcasting and all that,
um,

144
00:07:56,930 --> 00:08:01,040
were you shocked that sort of the tenor
and the way people talk about these

145
00:08:01,041 --> 00:08:02,690
things and all that?
Well,

146
00:08:03,090 --> 00:08:04,770
you know,
when I first started,

147
00:08:04,771 --> 00:08:08,460
when I first started the blog and then
I started doing videos, I mean, one,

148
00:08:08,461 --> 00:08:11,910
I had no money,
no backers,

149
00:08:11,911 --> 00:08:15,780
no idea what I was doing. And the,
I mean, the first videos that I did,

150
00:08:16,170 --> 00:08:18,900
or in my living room, I
have no makeup on, no light,

151
00:08:18,901 --> 00:08:22,650
and using my phone look ridiculous.
Got No views whatsoever.

152
00:08:22,651 --> 00:08:26,610
And so it was after I
persisted for a little bit,

153
00:08:26,611 --> 00:08:29,040
sometimes I look back and I'm like,
why did you even persist?

154
00:08:29,070 --> 00:08:31,380
No one was telling you to,
but you did.

155
00:08:31,381 --> 00:08:35,190
And then it's really the first time
that you get any kind of attention or

156
00:08:35,191 --> 00:08:38,760
affirmation that you also
see the other side of it, uh,

157
00:08:38,790 --> 00:08:41,670
that you also see the negativity when
you're just doing it kind of for yourself.

158
00:08:41,671 --> 00:08:44,460
And for the few people that follow
you, you're like, this is great.

159
00:08:44,490 --> 00:08:46,620
Everyone loves me.
The three people that follow me,

160
00:08:46,770 --> 00:08:49,740
I'll let me and my parents and my
husband love what I do. This is great.

161
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:53,490
But then as soon as something kind
of blows up, yeah, as they say,

162
00:08:53,491 --> 00:08:55,770
you see the negative side of it,
then you okay.

163
00:08:55,771 --> 00:08:57,660
People don't just disagree with you,

164
00:08:57,930 --> 00:09:01,080
they really hate you and they really
think that you're a bad person.

165
00:09:01,081 --> 00:09:05,400
Especially if you espouse any kind of
faith that immediately comes into question

166
00:09:05,401 --> 00:09:07,830
if you disagree with them.
And that was hard. I mean,

167
00:09:07,831 --> 00:09:11,160
I used to focus on the comments a lot.
You have to stop doing that though.

168
00:09:11,161 --> 00:09:15,630
It's so unhealthy. So that's kind of a,
that's changed over the past few years.

169
00:09:15,631 --> 00:09:20,160
Definitely. But uh, yeah, I think the
hatred threw me for a loop at first.

170
00:09:20,380 --> 00:09:23,170
Yeah. Well it just sort of comes and
you don't really know what to do.

171
00:09:23,171 --> 00:09:25,690
And then at some point, I think I've
come around to the place where it's like,

172
00:09:25,691 --> 00:09:28,450
the more I get, I'm like, oh, I
must be doing something right. Yeah.

173
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:31,540
People used to lie about what I
was saying and I didn't like that.

174
00:09:31,690 --> 00:09:34,840
Now they actually quote me and
I'm like, Oh, this is actually,

175
00:09:35,350 --> 00:09:38,950
this is what must be feel like when you
made it think it was actually you that

176
00:09:38,951 --> 00:09:43,690
tweeted the other day, some article
by right wing watch was I you and yes,

177
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:44,913
they did

178
00:09:45,130 --> 00:09:46,600
call on me not that long ago too.

179
00:09:46,601 --> 00:09:51,250
They quoted something that I said at
CRTV and of course everything looks like

180
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:52,010
it's some hiphop

181
00:09:52,010 --> 00:09:55,400
piece. But then I read it and I'm like,
that's what I, that's what I said.

182
00:09:56,810 --> 00:10:00,860
I was like, this is an actual
basically an honest piece.

183
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:04,760
Really close as quoted show. Exactly. And
I'm like, if people think that's crazy,

184
00:10:04,761 --> 00:10:07,760
I'm totally fine with that. But
like you said, don't lie about,

185
00:10:07,850 --> 00:10:12,800
don't lie about what I'm saying.
Is it unique to be a woman in this space?

186
00:10:12,801 --> 00:10:15,590
Use a little identity politics here.
I thought Republicans and the right,

187
00:10:15,591 --> 00:10:19,070
I thought they hate women.
You don't listen to women,
don't they subjugate women

188
00:10:22,490 --> 00:10:26,270
who are pregnant,
but I am wearing shoes and so I am,

189
00:10:26,450 --> 00:10:29,320
I've against that part of that.
No, I, I've never, I've never

190
00:10:29,430 --> 00:10:31,020
really understood that argument.

191
00:10:31,021 --> 00:10:36,000
I guess if you equate women's rights
to abortion and to this mythical gender

192
00:10:36,001 --> 00:10:39,300
wage gap that needs to somehow
be filled by the government,

193
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:43,110
if you equate women's rights to that and
women's empowerment to that, then sure.

194
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:46,590
Um, I guess the left is
the only place for women.

195
00:10:46,591 --> 00:10:51,420
But if you believe in entrepreneurship,
if you believe in the marketplace,

196
00:10:51,450 --> 00:10:54,870
if you believe that women
have the potential and the
dignity that a man has and

197
00:10:54,871 --> 00:10:58,440
the potential to do everything
that a man does in a way,

198
00:10:58,441 --> 00:11:01,080
at least as far as her career
goes and leadership goes,

199
00:11:01,380 --> 00:11:04,350
then I don't see why you wouldn't
be a conservative. Unfortunately,

200
00:11:04,351 --> 00:11:08,790
we do have a PR problem, uh, on the
right, and I voted for president Trump,

201
00:11:08,791 --> 00:11:13,050
but president Trump doesn't really help
the rights case when it comes to women,

202
00:11:13,620 --> 00:11:16,230
not just because of things
he said and done with women.

203
00:11:16,231 --> 00:11:20,130
But also I think a lot of moms,
especially hear him talk,

204
00:11:20,131 --> 00:11:23,820
hear him at his rallies, he's got a little
bit of a of a mouth and they're like,

205
00:11:24,390 --> 00:11:26,850
I don't, you know, I don't really
want my kids listening to that.

206
00:11:26,851 --> 00:11:29,490
That's not who I want my kids to be.
I wouldn't marry someone like that.

207
00:11:29,491 --> 00:11:33,000
And so I do think that he makes it a
little bit difficult sometimes to make the

208
00:11:33,001 --> 00:11:33,834
case.

209
00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:37,060
Is that the odd catch 22 of
almost everything Trump does?

210
00:11:37,061 --> 00:11:39,190
Cause we talked about this briefly right
before we started where it's like the

211
00:11:39,191 --> 00:11:43,870
policies pretty much make sense then if
you can remove that from the tweets or

212
00:11:43,871 --> 00:11:46,590
the person, it's like he's actually
at a ton of high level limits.

213
00:11:46,630 --> 00:11:49,930
Totally in the administration. If you
care, if that's what you're looking at,

214
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:54,100
it just makes it more difficult,
I think that you're able to

215
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:54,610
do it.

216
00:11:54,610 --> 00:11:59,110
But when the left has such a
monopoly on media megaphones,

217
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:02,890
when they have an monopoly on Hollywood,
they have a monopoly on academia.

218
00:12:02,891 --> 00:12:03,760
I won't say monopoly,

219
00:12:03,761 --> 00:12:06,640
but they're controlling a lot of the
messaging that comes out and they're,

220
00:12:06,820 --> 00:12:10,540
they're good at PR, they're good at the
emotionalism that, not to be sexist,

221
00:12:10,541 --> 00:12:12,400
but appeals to a lot of women.

222
00:12:12,610 --> 00:12:16,510
And so you hear the rhetoric of Trump
is putting kids in cages and he grabs

223
00:12:16,511 --> 00:12:19,900
women by the genitals and you're a woman.
You're like, I can't vote for that.

224
00:12:19,930 --> 00:12:20,681
I can't do that.

225
00:12:20,681 --> 00:12:25,210
And so in order to separate some of the
lies from the truth and separate the

226
00:12:25,211 --> 00:12:28,870
things that Trump has said from the good
things that he's done for men and women,

227
00:12:29,050 --> 00:12:31,570
you have to think and you
have to go a step further.

228
00:12:31,571 --> 00:12:35,410
You have to do your own research.
And a lot of people, male or female,

229
00:12:35,710 --> 00:12:37,510
just don't want to do that.

230
00:12:37,511 --> 00:12:40,420
When you can read headlines
by just swiping your thumb,

231
00:12:40,630 --> 00:12:44,680
why are you going to take the time to
actually click on an article and then

232
00:12:44,740 --> 00:12:46,780
double check it and make
sure that it's right.

233
00:12:46,810 --> 00:12:50,170
It's just harder to be a conservative
for that very reason. Takes more effort.

234
00:12:50,330 --> 00:12:52,670
How do you cut through the clutter? I
mean, that's one of the things that,

235
00:12:52,671 --> 00:12:55,370
especially when I go to colleges,
that kids ask me all the time, like,

236
00:12:55,371 --> 00:12:58,540
how do you actually figure
out what's true? Yeah.

237
00:12:58,580 --> 00:13:01,910
Because reading all of these
articles, it's like, I mean,

238
00:13:01,911 --> 00:13:04,400
we know because they write them
about us, and then it's like, well,

239
00:13:04,401 --> 00:13:07,280
I know what lies that were in there.
So what else?

240
00:13:07,490 --> 00:13:08,580
What else are they lying to us about?

241
00:13:08,650 --> 00:13:11,230
I mean, you really have to try
and go to the source if you can.

242
00:13:11,231 --> 00:13:13,030
If they said that someone says something,

243
00:13:13,180 --> 00:13:17,590
you have to actually go to the actual
quote or the actual video. I mean,

244
00:13:17,740 --> 00:13:22,180
a perfect example of this is when
president Trump, uh, just the other day,

245
00:13:22,220 --> 00:13:24,520
the clip of him saying,

246
00:13:24,670 --> 00:13:27,940
or allegedly saying that asylum
seekers we're animals with circulating.

247
00:13:27,970 --> 00:13:31,840
I'm great. Yeah. It was deceptively
edited. And so in order for you,

248
00:13:31,870 --> 00:13:34,510
someone like Chrissy Tiegen who tweeted
about it and said that, you know,

249
00:13:34,511 --> 00:13:37,680
he's awful. Okay. In order for you
not to believe Chrissy Tiegen for,

250
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:40,350
in order for you to not believe the
tweets that she quote tweeted, yeah.

251
00:13:40,630 --> 00:13:43,580
You're several Democratic candidates,
by the way. Yes. Yes. Also.

252
00:13:43,581 --> 00:13:46,370
So it's not just Hollywood celebrities,
even though they knew he wasn't,

253
00:13:46,550 --> 00:13:51,190
just to be very clear here, he was not
saying that asylum seekers or animals,

254
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:53,150
he was specifically talking about yeah.

255
00:13:53,820 --> 00:13:58,810
13 yeah. Which is a totally
appropriate description of them. Um,

256
00:13:58,890 --> 00:14:00,960
but in order to realize that that's a lie,

257
00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:03,870
you have to jump through a lot of hoops.
I mean,

258
00:14:03,871 --> 00:14:05,540
because say I'm someone
on the laughter Sam,

259
00:14:05,550 --> 00:14:08,340
someone in the middle and I see
Dave Rubin or Ben Shapiro say,

260
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:11,370
that's not really what he said. Well,
why should I believe you anymore?

261
00:14:11,371 --> 00:14:15,000
So you have to go to the actual source.
You have to go to actual reporting.

262
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:15,960
It's more effort.

263
00:14:15,961 --> 00:14:19,080
That's something that you and I are
probably willing to do because we know the

264
00:14:19,081 --> 00:14:22,080
game that they're playing.
But a lot of people just don't know.

265
00:14:22,230 --> 00:14:25,810
But I also think that's why
people are turning away. Uh,

266
00:14:25,900 --> 00:14:29,550
and especially young people from
mainstream media and from talking heads in

267
00:14:29,551 --> 00:14:33,390
listening to podcasts where there's
conversations and when there was dialogue

268
00:14:33,391 --> 00:14:36,300
where there's nuance and where
people are willing to say, you know,

269
00:14:36,301 --> 00:14:39,060
I don't know that much about this.
Here's what both sides are saying.

270
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:42,810
You hardly ever see that on the news.
So I think, I think that's part of it.

271
00:14:42,811 --> 00:14:44,460
It's a change in the media landscape.

272
00:14:44,610 --> 00:14:46,860
Yeah.
Where do you think Trump fits in?

273
00:14:46,861 --> 00:14:49,800
I try not to do that much about Trump in
general, but since you brought him up,

274
00:14:49,830 --> 00:14:50,663
yeah.
Um,

275
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:54,350
where do you think he fits in with sort
of the future of conservatism then? Yeah,

276
00:14:54,510 --> 00:14:56,720
I can sense a little push
and pull with you on him.

277
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:59,840
Yeah. I mean I voted for him and
I think I'll vote for him again.

278
00:14:59,841 --> 00:15:04,550
It's mostly because I voted for him in
2016 mostly because lesser of two evils

279
00:15:04,551 --> 00:15:09,500
then. I didn't think that he was going
to lead very conservatively. I mean,

280
00:15:09,501 --> 00:15:13,520
especially prolife, it's a huge issue for
me at, he had just a few years earlier,

281
00:15:13,521 --> 00:15:14,750
said he was pro choice.

282
00:15:14,780 --> 00:15:18,770
He didn't seem to emulate any of the
conservative or Christian values that I

283
00:15:18,771 --> 00:15:19,730
hold in my life.

284
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,270
But then I looked at Hillary Clinton and
I looked at how I felt like the country

285
00:15:23,271 --> 00:15:26,960
was torn apart by Barack Obama over the
past eight years. And I was like, okay,

286
00:15:27,290 --> 00:15:32,290
someone who is going to probably advocate
for legislation and surround himself

287
00:15:32,541 --> 00:15:35,720
with people that aligns more with
my values or someone who I think is

288
00:15:35,721 --> 00:15:39,020
diametrically opposed policywise
to everything I believe.

289
00:15:39,230 --> 00:15:42,680
So I chose him and I think I would
choose him again because again, I,

290
00:15:42,740 --> 00:15:45,440
not that I would ever vote Democrat
and I've never been on the left,

291
00:15:45,710 --> 00:15:47,840
but if I were,
say I were a centrist,

292
00:15:47,841 --> 00:15:50,750
I would be looking over to
the left and saying, okay,

293
00:15:50,751 --> 00:15:53,540
this guy don't like what he
says don't like his personality.

294
00:15:53,540 --> 00:15:56,240
I think he's too brash and
sometimes he doesn't make any sense.

295
00:15:56,241 --> 00:16:00,050
He calls Tim Cook Tim Apple. Okay.
Yeah. Like he's a little embarrassing.

296
00:16:00,051 --> 00:16:02,900
But then I will get people who are
advocating for late term abortion,

297
00:16:02,901 --> 00:16:05,140
open borders and socialism and I'm like,
oh,

298
00:16:05,141 --> 00:16:08,180
like my babies and my private property.
I think I'm going to stick with Trump.

299
00:16:08,630 --> 00:16:10,700
And so yeah,

300
00:16:10,701 --> 00:16:14,180
I'm even more so in that camp because
I am a conservative and I do care about

301
00:16:14,181 --> 00:16:16,490
the future of the country
and I hate socialism,

302
00:16:16,790 --> 00:16:18,560
so of course I'm going
to vote for him again.

303
00:16:18,561 --> 00:16:22,000
And I think that's how a lot of people
feel sometimes a hard case to make.

304
00:16:22,130 --> 00:16:24,260
Yeah, that's how I see it. I mean,

305
00:16:24,261 --> 00:16:27,080
it's like if you guys could
just not be that bananas,

306
00:16:27,230 --> 00:16:30,140
they can then the refugees who
wouldn't do it leaving you,

307
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:33,020
but you just can't not
be completely insane.

308
00:16:33,090 --> 00:16:36,450
No, they give us something here. Well,
sometimes I wonder if it's a strategy.

309
00:16:36,451 --> 00:16:40,120
Are they taking us to the nth degree?
Are they taking us to the,

310
00:16:40,220 --> 00:16:44,280
the most crazy marks isn't that they can
actually take us. Are they taking us to,

311
00:16:44,281 --> 00:16:46,170
for example,
medicare for all,

312
00:16:46,171 --> 00:16:48,360
just so we'll get on board
with health care for all.

313
00:16:48,550 --> 00:16:52,320
Are they taking us to open borders just
so we'll be okay with abolishing ice?

314
00:16:52,470 --> 00:16:54,210
Are they taking us to,
you know,

315
00:16:54,211 --> 00:16:56,460
killing babies outside of the
womb to where we can say, okay,

316
00:16:56,461 --> 00:16:59,640
as long as it's limited the second
trimester because I, I mean,

317
00:16:59,641 --> 00:17:01,740
I don't think that's going to work,
but I do wonder,

318
00:17:01,741 --> 00:17:03,240
are you guys pushing us to the limits?

319
00:17:03,270 --> 00:17:06,690
So we'll settle for something a little
bit less, but that's still liberal.

320
00:17:06,691 --> 00:17:08,240
I Dunno. Yeah. I mean,

321
00:17:08,770 --> 00:17:12,910
I suppose that could, well, you know,
I don't know what the answer is,

322
00:17:12,911 --> 00:17:16,180
but I suppose they could be doing, I mean,
Trump does a little of that, right? Yeah.

323
00:17:16,210 --> 00:17:18,580
Take out something really far
and then you come in. I mean,

324
00:17:18,581 --> 00:17:20,770
that's what negotiations are
about. Yeah. I don't know.

325
00:17:20,771 --> 00:17:24,600
But watching these guys go off the deep
end has been quite something. And I,

326
00:17:24,610 --> 00:17:27,870
so I mentioned to you a couple of
days ago on a, on Twitter. So I,

327
00:17:27,910 --> 00:17:32,410
you've been hitting the AOC pretty
hard and I think your arguments,

328
00:17:32,411 --> 00:17:34,180
you never attack her personally.

329
00:17:34,181 --> 00:17:39,070
You always go for policy or for the
context of what she's talking about.

330
00:17:39,071 --> 00:17:43,870
Yeah. Um, tell me a little bit about
why you're not thrilled with AOC.

331
00:17:44,270 --> 00:17:47,930
Well, we hear a lot of people in
the last sane, oh, AOC gets tea all,

332
00:17:47,931 --> 00:17:51,420
she's really getting into y'all and she
really bothers you. And I'm like, yes,

333
00:17:51,450 --> 00:17:53,940
she really does. I'm not even
going to pretend like she does.

334
00:17:53,941 --> 00:17:55,290
It especially bothers me.

335
00:17:55,500 --> 00:18:00,500
She's specially bothers me because
she is representative of millennials,

336
00:18:01,351 --> 00:18:02,580
which she isn't really,

337
00:18:02,581 --> 00:18:07,320
but she's representative of
the stereotypes of millennials
and she's a woman and

338
00:18:07,321 --> 00:18:12,321
so she is claiming to represent all
millennials and all women and she is

339
00:18:13,350 --> 00:18:16,830
espousing and saying everything
that is so diametrically opposed,

340
00:18:16,831 --> 00:18:19,830
not only to what I believe in,
but what is good for America.

341
00:18:19,831 --> 00:18:23,700
And also like she just says dumb things.
Just dumb.

342
00:18:23,730 --> 00:18:27,180
It's not that okay. She's crazy.
Like I think Bernie Sanders is crazy,

343
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:30,240
but I think he's probably smart.
Like he can make a pretty good argument.

344
00:18:30,510 --> 00:18:34,440
She just isn't good. She's not even
good at fulfilling her own arguments.

345
00:18:34,830 --> 00:18:39,090
And I think it's her.
It's the hypocrisy to of saying,

346
00:18:39,091 --> 00:18:41,490
well no one has any
legitimate concerns with me.

347
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:43,950
No one has any legitimate criticism.

348
00:18:44,370 --> 00:18:49,020
I'm going to pull this random tweet from
this person with pin followers and say,

349
00:18:49,140 --> 00:18:53,040
well, this is all of the right, making
fun of my shoes. This is all they've got.

350
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:53,761
Well,
no,

351
00:18:53,761 --> 00:18:57,900
there's been a lot of people asking you
for dialogue and debate and to discuss

352
00:18:57,901 --> 00:19:01,140
ideas and policies and you refuse to,
that's what bothers me.

353
00:19:01,430 --> 00:19:05,690
Yeah. So what do we do about that? Because
the energy of the media, the focus,

354
00:19:05,691 --> 00:19:08,750
so much of it is on her. I agree. I
don't think she's particularly bright.

355
00:19:08,751 --> 00:19:12,500
I think she has handlers that
at times are writing her.

356
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:15,620
She's not writing most of these
tweets. Yes, maybe she types them out,

357
00:19:15,980 --> 00:19:19,580
but it's very clear if you listen to
her speak the way she speaks and her

358
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:23,360
understanding of
information is very loose.

359
00:19:23,390 --> 00:19:25,010
And then in Twitter form,

360
00:19:25,130 --> 00:19:28,700
she knows all these things about history
and policy and all of these things and

361
00:19:28,701 --> 00:19:31,130
the idea that she wrote the
green deal or any of that stuff,

362
00:19:31,610 --> 00:19:32,570
it's just all nonsense.

363
00:19:32,571 --> 00:19:36,710
But what do you do if so
much of the energy is focused
there? Um, which, which I,

364
00:19:36,711 --> 00:19:38,420
you know, I think we're in
agreement. It's dangerous.

365
00:19:38,690 --> 00:19:40,730
How do you move that if she won't debate?

366
00:19:40,890 --> 00:19:41,460
Yeah,

367
00:19:41,460 --> 00:19:45,000
I think the all you can do is advocate
for your own policies and ideas the best

368
00:19:45,001 --> 00:19:47,880
way that you can. And yes, of
course, to call out her lies and say,

369
00:19:48,090 --> 00:19:51,030
this is why it's a lie. I mean,
you might not convince everyone,

370
00:19:51,180 --> 00:19:54,240
but maybe there is one person who thought
that her tweet was awesome and looked

371
00:19:54,241 --> 00:19:55,770
at what you said and said,
okay,

372
00:19:55,771 --> 00:19:59,160
well maybe now I am starting to
see a pattern of not just her,

373
00:19:59,161 --> 00:20:01,990
but people like her that use
identity politics and use, uh,

374
00:20:02,130 --> 00:20:05,400
this victimhood narrative. Someone
like Ilhan Omar as well to say, Oh,

375
00:20:05,401 --> 00:20:07,950
you can't criticize me.
I'm seeing that a lot.

376
00:20:07,951 --> 00:20:11,190
Maybe her credibility comes into question.
So I do think that's important.

377
00:20:11,430 --> 00:20:14,130
I think it's important to keep it
above board as much as we can with the

378
00:20:14,131 --> 00:20:18,270
criticisms. Now I'm not necessarily good
at that. Like sometimes I just want to,

379
00:20:19,070 --> 00:20:20,850
yeah. And I don't, I
don't want to call it,

380
00:20:20,851 --> 00:20:24,750
I mean I don't think I ever go for
anything super personal or ad Hominine,

381
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:27,660
but there are times where I just want
to be like, this girl's an idiot.

382
00:20:27,661 --> 00:20:31,050
She's an idiot. And I don't think that
that's probably just to call myself out.

383
00:20:31,051 --> 00:20:32,850
I don't think that's the
most productive thing to do.

384
00:20:32,851 --> 00:20:35,370
We should probably say why she's wrong.
Um,

385
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:40,020
but someone who I think is actually
trying to play her same game, um,

386
00:20:40,050 --> 00:20:42,540
it's a little bit different
cause he's older and he's a man,

387
00:20:42,541 --> 00:20:47,541
but Dan Crenshaw is using social media
to his benefit to actually talk about

388
00:20:48,281 --> 00:20:51,580
what's going on in Congress. Say, here's
the legislation I'm trying to get past.

389
00:20:51,581 --> 00:20:54,040
Here's what the Democrats are doing,
here's the back and forth fight.

390
00:20:54,250 --> 00:20:57,340
We have hardly any transparency
in Congress from the right.

391
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:59,620
We don't have a young
representative that saying, okay,

392
00:20:59,830 --> 00:21:02,260
this is what you're hearing.
Here's what's actually happening.

393
00:21:02,470 --> 00:21:04,090
AOC is trying to do that.

394
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:07,210
But you do have someone like Dan Crinshaw
who's trying to do it on our side and

395
00:21:07,211 --> 00:21:08,080
I think that's important.

396
00:21:08,210 --> 00:21:12,710
What do you think is the goal of this
new crop of Democrats? Like do you like,

397
00:21:12,711 --> 00:21:13,221
to me,

398
00:21:13,221 --> 00:21:18,221
they genuinely want to change every
fundamental law and every fundamental

399
00:21:21,590 --> 00:21:26,330
philosophy that is underpinned this
country for over 200 years. Really,

400
00:21:26,450 --> 00:21:28,700
it sounds alarmist,
it sounds conspiratorial,

401
00:21:28,701 --> 00:21:32,260
but I think they're deeply on
proud of what America is. Yeah. Um,

402
00:21:32,330 --> 00:21:34,930
and it's very sad for me, as we
talked about right before we started,

403
00:21:34,940 --> 00:21:37,130
it's like this ain't the
party at JFK anymore.

404
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:40,050
Right? It was one thing when
we just disagreed on policy.

405
00:21:40,051 --> 00:21:42,330
It's another thing when
we disagree on patriotism,

406
00:21:42,331 --> 00:21:47,100
it's when we disagree that fundamentally
America was founded on good ideas.

407
00:21:47,101 --> 00:21:49,020
Maybe you don't like the
founder founding fathers,

408
00:21:49,021 --> 00:21:50,880
maybe you don't even like
that they owned slaves.

409
00:21:51,210 --> 00:21:54,540
Maybe you think that America has a bad
history. We can probably agree on that,

410
00:21:54,541 --> 00:21:56,340
that America doesn't
have a perfect history,

411
00:21:56,640 --> 00:22:00,630
but us not agreeing on
basic constitutional values
of individual liberty,

412
00:22:00,631 --> 00:22:03,690
of the rates that are
endowed to us by our creator.

413
00:22:03,691 --> 00:22:06,090
That creates a whole
other host of problems.

414
00:22:06,091 --> 00:22:10,080
We have not more complicated
disagreements between this new crop,

415
00:22:10,260 --> 00:22:12,630
but a more fundamental disagreements,

416
00:22:12,631 --> 00:22:15,150
more simple disagreements
than we've ever had before.

417
00:22:15,390 --> 00:22:18,810
That's what makes them so
frustrated. And, and people like me,

418
00:22:18,811 --> 00:22:23,040
like us who care about American values
and are down with the constitution,

419
00:22:23,370 --> 00:22:24,990
it's really kind of mind boggling.

420
00:22:24,990 --> 00:22:27,780
Like we don't even know where to
take their arguments sometimes.

421
00:22:27,990 --> 00:22:30,000
But when you look at what's
coming out of academia,

422
00:22:30,001 --> 00:22:33,450
I mean all this postmodern garbage,
it kind of makes sense.

423
00:22:33,451 --> 00:22:37,830
I mean they've been taught that America
is this imperialist aggressor in

424
00:22:37,831 --> 00:22:41,430
everywhere. Boots have been on American
boots had been on the ground. Uh,

425
00:22:41,490 --> 00:22:44,820
evil has spread and white nationalism
has spread. That's what they're learning.

426
00:22:44,821 --> 00:22:47,370
And you're like, okay, I
can see where they got that.

427
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:50,100
It's sad because it's an accurate.
Um,

428
00:22:50,190 --> 00:22:52,560
but I think that's kind of where it's
coming from and that's what they're

429
00:22:52,561 --> 00:22:53,360
promulgating.

430
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:55,940
Yeah. Are there parts of their
right that you're not happy with?

431
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:59,670
Definitely. I mean, if the alt
rate is even still a thing,

432
00:22:59,671 --> 00:23:03,300
I feel like it's kind of had its heyday.
I literally prayed that it's had.

433
00:23:03,540 --> 00:23:06,180
Of course I don't like them. I think
there are a bunch of Internet trolls.

434
00:23:06,181 --> 00:23:08,340
There are people also
who think that the world,

435
00:23:08,370 --> 00:23:10,590
the West is going to be
one back through memes.

436
00:23:10,770 --> 00:23:14,730
I don't think there's anything wrong
with me and the other all cause means no,

437
00:23:14,830 --> 00:23:16,260
I don't think there's
anything wrong with that,

438
00:23:16,261 --> 00:23:18,060
but I don't think that's
primarily where the,

439
00:23:18,330 --> 00:23:21,900
where the battle is fought and then I
do get frustrated with people who can't

440
00:23:22,050 --> 00:23:25,800
ever criticize Trump when he says things.
For example,

441
00:23:25,801 --> 00:23:27,540
and this was a while ago saying,
okay,

442
00:23:27,541 --> 00:23:31,380
we'll take away their guns and then due
process or something like that or where

443
00:23:31,381 --> 00:23:34,710
they can't refute him on trade,
they can't push back at him at all.

444
00:23:34,830 --> 00:23:39,830
Or they try to paint him into
like this almost Demi God savior.

445
00:23:40,711 --> 00:23:45,120
That bothers me because, okay,
let's not pretend that he's Ronald.

446
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:48,500
He might've even done better things
than Ronald Reagan in a lot of ways,

447
00:23:48,710 --> 00:23:51,740
but let's not pretend that who
he is as a man is Ronald Reagan,

448
00:23:51,741 --> 00:23:56,240
that he represents all of our conservative
values. I think it's okay to say,

449
00:23:56,241 --> 00:23:57,650
you know what,
as a Christian,

450
00:23:57,651 --> 00:23:59,990
I don't really agree with a
lot of things that he says.

451
00:23:59,991 --> 00:24:03,080
A lot of the things that he's done.
I still like his policies,

452
00:24:03,230 --> 00:24:05,780
but I'm just going to be honest.
I don't love everything that he's done.

453
00:24:05,930 --> 00:24:10,070
The people that will not say that
that bothers me, I just don't get it.

454
00:24:10,140 --> 00:24:13,940
Do you think that there's a like
sort of a sickness around the cult of

455
00:24:13,950 --> 00:24:16,320
personality related to our politicians?

456
00:24:16,321 --> 00:24:18,720
The way we talk about them
and think about them. I mean,

457
00:24:18,721 --> 00:24:21,300
so you could take that with
Trump from certain people,

458
00:24:21,301 --> 00:24:24,810
you know the certain just diehard mag
of people who would never find fault and

459
00:24:24,811 --> 00:24:26,340
you could take that
with the obsession with,

460
00:24:26,430 --> 00:24:28,570
oh there's better with
his shirt rolled up,

461
00:24:28,571 --> 00:24:32,190
stand and auditable and skateboarding
and just the way we talk about them,

462
00:24:32,191 --> 00:24:36,300
like they're all celebrities or the that
they have the where with all to fix all

463
00:24:36,301 --> 00:24:39,420
our problems.
It all actually feels gross to me.

464
00:24:39,421 --> 00:24:43,770
Like politics feels very gross to me for
someone that talks about it as much as

465
00:24:43,771 --> 00:24:43,990
I should.

466
00:24:43,990 --> 00:24:44,800
Yeah.

467
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:47,890
I don't know if it's because it's gotten
so dramatize that it almost feels like

468
00:24:47,891 --> 00:24:49,030
our favorite soap opera.

469
00:24:49,031 --> 00:24:52,870
You know how someone has a character
that they just love and can do no wrong.

470
00:24:52,900 --> 00:24:55,720
They're like, I'm, I'm fighting
for this person in this show.

471
00:24:55,930 --> 00:24:59,950
It's almost that are our politics
have become so celebritize,

472
00:24:59,951 --> 00:25:04,000
which really almost started with Barack
Obama and so dramatize that people have

473
00:25:04,001 --> 00:25:07,630
picked their favorite characters and
they feel like they have to pick one and

474
00:25:07,631 --> 00:25:09,560
there's, there's no wait. Yeah,

475
00:25:09,700 --> 00:25:11,380
there's no way that they're
going to pick the other one.

476
00:25:11,381 --> 00:25:16,381
But I also think it has to do with the
fact that they see their enemy as so bad,

477
00:25:17,831 --> 00:25:22,831
as so crazy as so radical and the left
is beating up on Trump so much and so

478
00:25:23,171 --> 00:25:25,160
unfairly that they,

479
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:27,790
I think they're honestly thinking
and maybe with good intentions.

480
00:25:27,791 --> 00:25:31,240
Why would I pile on that? Sure. Maybe I
don't like some of the stuff that he does,

481
00:25:31,570 --> 00:25:33,640
but we never hear any of
the good that he does.

482
00:25:33,641 --> 00:25:36,640
So I'm going to be a part of the group
that talks about the good that he does

483
00:25:36,641 --> 00:25:39,790
and not the bad. So maybe,
maybe those intentions are pure.

484
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,410
Yeah. So I, I do agree with that.

485
00:25:41,411 --> 00:25:43,840
I think that there's a certain set of
people that think, well wait a minute,

486
00:25:43,841 --> 00:25:48,010
this guy is relentlessly getting
attacked and lied about and Russia

487
00:25:48,011 --> 00:25:51,780
investigations and everything else. So
when he says something like to me, the,

488
00:25:51,830 --> 00:25:53,600
the one that you hit on a there,

489
00:25:53,650 --> 00:25:55,900
we'll take away the guns first
and then the due process. To me,

490
00:25:55,901 --> 00:26:00,380
that probably is the worst thing that he
has said in, in the two plus years. Yeah.

491
00:26:00,820 --> 00:26:05,820
And I could see why a decent person that
would know that that's wrong wouldn't

492
00:26:05,950 --> 00:26:08,190
go crazy about it because a,

493
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:12,850
he probably was probably just like
sloppy language maybe. Right. Maybe,

494
00:26:13,210 --> 00:26:17,830
but B, it's like everyone's attacking the
guy constantly. Like cut him some slack.

495
00:26:17,831 --> 00:26:20,020
But I guess it,
there's a danger in that too.

496
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:23,360
Yeah. And I think it's that they look
at his actions, they keep saying,

497
00:26:23,361 --> 00:26:25,560
or I should say we,
we look at his actions like,

498
00:26:25,850 --> 00:26:28,730
do I think that he is
ideologically prolife?

499
00:26:28,820 --> 00:26:32,270
Do I think he really cares about abortion?
Probably not now.

500
00:26:32,271 --> 00:26:34,430
Maybe he's been awakened to
like a lot of people have,

501
00:26:34,431 --> 00:26:37,670
but the New York law and Virginia bail
that didn't get passed and said, okay,

502
00:26:37,671 --> 00:26:38,570
that's really bad,

503
00:26:38,930 --> 00:26:42,740
but I don't really care what he
personally thinks about abortion.

504
00:26:43,350 --> 00:26:46,980
He's been a a prolife advocate
and I think that's a good thing.

505
00:26:46,981 --> 00:26:49,650
And I want him to advocate for
the things that I believe in.

506
00:26:49,890 --> 00:26:53,820
And I always knew when I was always
pretty confident in the fact that even if

507
00:26:53,821 --> 00:26:56,370
he's not an idealogue,
which I think we all knew that he wasn't,

508
00:26:56,550 --> 00:27:00,180
he was going to surround himself by
people that would push the values in the

509
00:27:00,181 --> 00:27:04,680
policies that conservatives
believe in him. That's nowadays,

510
00:27:04,681 --> 00:27:08,730
that's really all I care abouts.
Almost all. I wouldn't say all,

511
00:27:08,731 --> 00:27:11,220
but that's most of what I care
about it enough to get my vote.

512
00:27:11,300 --> 00:27:14,510
So is that the irony I guess for Christian
conservatives is that you needed a

513
00:27:14,511 --> 00:27:17,390
guy that was going to do a play,
a dirty game,

514
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:21,770
and maybe you couldn't get
Romney or McCain. Yeah, I
mean tried it the other way,

515
00:27:21,771 --> 00:27:24,620
like those guys weren't going to play
in such a way because it's not just that

516
00:27:24,621 --> 00:27:26,090
you're fighting the candidate,

517
00:27:26,091 --> 00:27:28,910
you're also fighting the
media establishment in
the colleges and all that.

518
00:27:29,330 --> 00:27:33,490
That's not how I thought of it because
I didn't vote for him in the primaries.

519
00:27:33,491 --> 00:27:34,610
In Lichen,
in the primaries,

520
00:27:34,611 --> 00:27:37,190
I actively talked about not
voting for him in the primary.

521
00:27:37,310 --> 00:27:38,210
Do you make or what's the,

522
00:27:38,211 --> 00:27:41,780
the onslaught against Christians
because I talk about it,

523
00:27:41,781 --> 00:27:46,310
I talk about it pretty frequently on,
on Twitter and here and I'm not Christian,

524
00:27:46,311 --> 00:27:48,050
but I see what's going on and it's,
yeah,

525
00:27:48,170 --> 00:27:52,430
this is now the state sanctioned bigotry.
Yeah. That's okay. Not quite staid,

526
00:27:52,431 --> 00:27:54,880
but like, yeah, if you care about
what the media is allowed, you know,

527
00:27:54,881 --> 00:27:58,820
you can always attack white Christian
man. Totally. They're all homophobes in,

528
00:27:58,821 --> 00:28:01,040
they're all big bigots and
all of this nonsense. Yeah.

529
00:28:01,310 --> 00:28:05,510
And I go to events with these people all
the time and I find them to be decent

530
00:28:05,511 --> 00:28:10,511
and respectful and willing to disagree
and walk away without punching you and

531
00:28:11,091 --> 00:28:13,760
everything else. But what do
you make of just like the focus?

532
00:28:13,870 --> 00:28:17,170
Yeah. On that? Well, it's part of,
it's part of intersectionality.

533
00:28:17,171 --> 00:28:20,230
You posted the quiz the
other day that it was like,

534
00:28:20,231 --> 00:28:23,680
what's your intersectionality score?
Intersectionality scores. Yes.

535
00:28:23,681 --> 00:28:26,860
And one of the things that you could
slide was whether or not you're a devout

536
00:28:26,861 --> 00:28:29,200
Christian.
The more devout of a Christian you are,

537
00:28:29,201 --> 00:28:33,460
I guess the more privileged Dui or the
lower you are in the intersectionality

538
00:28:33,461 --> 00:28:35,140
scale or something like that.

539
00:28:35,141 --> 00:28:39,400
And so I think it's just associated
because America and the West, uh,

540
00:28:39,460 --> 00:28:41,860
why is driven by,
uh,

541
00:28:41,980 --> 00:28:46,030
by Christianity and what's driven
specifically by Protestants. I mean,

542
00:28:46,031 --> 00:28:50,140
the revolutionary war was seen as a
Presbyterian and rebellion and a lot of

543
00:28:50,141 --> 00:28:54,630
those people line anything with anything
that is aligned with Americanism is

544
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:59,350
white nationalists is wrong,
is imperialist. Christianity
gets tied up in that.

545
00:28:59,560 --> 00:29:02,410
Now for Evangelical Christians,
we also know,

546
00:29:02,411 --> 00:29:05,830
because the Bible tells us that the
Church of Christ is going to be pushed to

547
00:29:05,831 --> 00:29:10,360
the margins until the world comes to
an end. And so we will be persecuted,

548
00:29:10,361 --> 00:29:14,320
we will, uh, be more and
more marginalized am yes,

549
00:29:14,321 --> 00:29:16,330
we can continue to fight
for Christian values.

550
00:29:16,331 --> 00:29:20,800
We continue to fight for being left alone
really is what we're really fighting

551
00:29:20,801 --> 00:29:22,240
for.
Just kind of leave us alone.

552
00:29:22,270 --> 00:29:27,040
That's what Protestants pretty much
have always done. Um, but yeah,

553
00:29:27,041 --> 00:29:28,450
I mean at the,
at the end of the day,

554
00:29:28,451 --> 00:29:31,600
we know that it's not going
to end well for us probably.

555
00:29:31,910 --> 00:29:35,390
Yeah. It's really crappy
situation. Like every day,

556
00:29:35,391 --> 00:29:38,660
just another tweet and another
story, this nonsense, you know,

557
00:29:38,661 --> 00:29:43,030
they'll do Chris Pratt church and
they'll try to make it seem like, oh,

558
00:29:43,031 --> 00:29:46,360
he's a homophobe and he goes, this
homophobic church and it's like, guys,

559
00:29:46,361 --> 00:29:49,120
you want to do a lot Omar's mosque,
now you want to do that.

560
00:29:49,121 --> 00:29:52,390
But they don't want to do that because
actually they're the bigots. Right.

561
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:53,950
That really is the truth.

562
00:29:54,060 --> 00:29:57,420
Yeah. And that's the thing is that
they're fine. They're really fine.

563
00:29:57,421 --> 00:30:01,980
The left is fine with you being a
Christian as long as you don't actually

564
00:30:01,981 --> 00:30:03,360
believe what the Bible says.

565
00:30:03,361 --> 00:30:07,410
So as long as you believe the
stuff about feeding the poor,

566
00:30:07,411 --> 00:30:10,920
as long as you believe that kind of stuff.
But that has to mean the government,

567
00:30:11,250 --> 00:30:16,080
they got rid of it. Feeding right,
right. Is longer. You're down with that,

568
00:30:16,081 --> 00:30:18,120
but you have to take
away the wrath of God.

569
00:30:18,121 --> 00:30:20,790
You had to take away Jesus be
the only way, truth and life.

570
00:30:20,791 --> 00:30:22,230
You have to take away the
biblical marriage stuff.

571
00:30:22,231 --> 00:30:25,620
You have to take away the abortion
stuff if to take away the hard work that

572
00:30:25,621 --> 00:30:29,130
proverbs talks about that even the
apostle Paul talks about kind of take all

573
00:30:29,131 --> 00:30:29,611
that away.

574
00:30:29,611 --> 00:30:32,640
As long as you're the Christian that
believes in wealth redistribution,

575
00:30:32,820 --> 00:30:33,360
you're good.

576
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:37,060
Yeah. That word. So let's dive
into some of the topics of the day.

577
00:30:37,061 --> 00:30:41,530
You mentioned the uh, the wage
gap. Yeah, it was recently.
It was, what was it, gender

578
00:30:41,730 --> 00:30:46,140
pay, gap day or Hashtag
you're so privileged you don't
even let her know our day.

579
00:30:46,570 --> 00:30:50,060
Even though I just made sure to pay
all my female plays less that day. Oh,

580
00:30:50,061 --> 00:30:53,990
just really drive it home. Yeah. Um,
is it a myth what's going on here?

581
00:30:54,390 --> 00:30:56,850
It's a myth because,
well, it's partly a math.

582
00:30:56,851 --> 00:31:01,050
What they don't tell you is the entire
story is this whole uncontrolled gap

583
00:31:01,051 --> 00:31:02,820
through our versus the controlled gap.

584
00:31:02,821 --> 00:31:07,620
And I actually heard about that
originally on a more left leaning site.

585
00:31:07,621 --> 00:31:12,450
That's an organization up in Seattle that
fights for equal pay and they actually

586
00:31:12,451 --> 00:31:14,970
taught me on their site the difference
between an uncontrolled gap and a

587
00:31:14,980 --> 00:31:15,813
controlled gap

588
00:31:16,450 --> 00:31:18,010
toward a great Twitter
thread on this by the way,

589
00:31:18,011 --> 00:31:19,150
which we'll link to in the description.

590
00:31:19,230 --> 00:31:22,320
Yeah. Yeah. It was the
control the gap, um,

591
00:31:22,390 --> 00:31:26,070
account or I'll start with
the uncontrolled gap. Does
not account for job title,

592
00:31:26,071 --> 00:31:28,260
doesn't account for experiences
and account for hours work.

593
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:32,010
It really doesn't put any factors
in. It's just the median, uh,

594
00:31:32,070 --> 00:31:36,660
what women make versus the median, what
men make, which is 79 cents to a dollar.

595
00:31:36,661 --> 00:31:37,471
That is true,

596
00:31:37,471 --> 00:31:41,520
but it doesn't account for any choices
or an experience that controlled gap

597
00:31:41,670 --> 00:31:45,840
accounts for all of those things.
So it accounts for job title hours worked,

598
00:31:46,170 --> 00:31:48,660
all of that. It does it account for, uh,

599
00:31:48,690 --> 00:31:52,740
like negotiating a raised as an account
for end of year bonuses or anything like

600
00:31:52,741 --> 00:31:53,101
that.

601
00:31:53,101 --> 00:31:57,930
But it does account for the big factors
and that is 99 cents on the dollar.

602
00:31:57,931 --> 00:32:02,400
So women make 99 cents to every
dollar that a man makes. But again,

603
00:32:02,850 --> 00:32:06,810
you're not accounting for a few factors
there and that could be within the

604
00:32:06,811 --> 00:32:09,030
margin of error.
So no matter what,

605
00:32:09,090 --> 00:32:13,770
there is no proof that there is
systemic sexism that is causing women,

606
00:32:13,980 --> 00:32:15,180
uh,
to make less money.

607
00:32:15,210 --> 00:32:15,391
Well,

608
00:32:15,391 --> 00:32:19,400
it also doesn't account for the fact that
men and women choose different careers

609
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:21,060
at the most simple level.
I mean,

610
00:32:21,061 --> 00:32:25,170
the best example of this is Sweden where
they have been completely egalitarian

611
00:32:25,171 --> 00:32:26,880
for ever.
Basically,

612
00:32:27,030 --> 00:32:30,150
I guess what there is still more male
engineers and there's still more female

613
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:31,140
versus,
yeah.

614
00:32:31,170 --> 00:32:33,960
So now they want to like force people to
do things that they don't actually want

615
00:32:33,961 --> 00:32:37,980
to do so they can get it 50 50 which yeah,
I'm not really a freedom work.

616
00:32:38,360 --> 00:32:40,070
No. And there's, I mean
there's a million different

617
00:32:40,070 --> 00:32:44,270
programs to try to get women into stem
because they've said for so long that the

618
00:32:44,271 --> 00:32:48,150
reason why there are so many
more men in stem is because, uh,

619
00:32:48,470 --> 00:32:52,880
women feel intimidated and because there's
this patriarchal attitude in the stem

620
00:32:52,881 --> 00:32:57,440
field, while so they've tried
so hard, they put so much
money behind it and still,

621
00:32:57,441 --> 00:33:01,550
I mean men are outpacing women or there
are so many more men in stem. The, I mean,

622
00:33:01,551 --> 00:33:03,110
just as many as there's ever been.

623
00:33:03,350 --> 00:33:08,350
And so it's probably not 80 outside
factors probably because women in general

624
00:33:08,541 --> 00:33:12,320
are different. How much of this
do you think is just misguided?

625
00:33:12,470 --> 00:33:15,770
Sort of confusion. So for
example, you're pregnant,

626
00:33:15,810 --> 00:33:17,120
your husband's here in the green room,

627
00:33:17,410 --> 00:33:19,220
your career is there going
to be a little bit different.

628
00:33:19,221 --> 00:33:23,000
But if you're going to probably take
some time off to it, child rear, yeah.

629
00:33:23,060 --> 00:33:25,360
Maybe he will take some maternity
time. Maybe not. But yeah,

630
00:33:25,460 --> 00:33:28,460
that just physiologically
we just are different.

631
00:33:28,461 --> 00:33:30,410
They don't like talking
about that. Yeah. Um,

632
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:32,390
but that is just the nature of reality.

633
00:33:32,500 --> 00:33:37,000
I saw a study the other day that it was
like breaking news and it was some study

634
00:33:37,001 --> 00:33:41,290
out of the UK that showed that there
is a difference between boys and girls

635
00:33:41,291 --> 00:33:45,640
brains inside the womb. That
is, uh, is it early as you know,

636
00:33:45,641 --> 00:33:49,300
however many weeks gestation that a
child's brain is developing and they start

637
00:33:49,301 --> 00:33:53,950
going in these divergent paths
of women, um, the, just the,

638
00:33:53,980 --> 00:33:55,430
how the neurons connected,

639
00:33:55,450 --> 00:33:58,930
women kind of being grown into
these interpersonal creatures,

640
00:33:59,140 --> 00:34:04,060
whereas men are more focused in
general on objects and data and things.

641
00:34:04,061 --> 00:34:08,680
Women are more focused on ideas and
words and people that starts in the womb.

642
00:34:08,681 --> 00:34:09,280
And I'm like,

643
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:13,720
I'm so glad science is finally catching
up to God and finally catching up to the

644
00:34:13,721 --> 00:34:15,760
things that we've known
for thousands of years.

645
00:34:15,761 --> 00:34:19,630
And so you do wonder if that's
going to happen? If, okay,

646
00:34:19,810 --> 00:34:23,800
we're trying all of these cool social
experiments right now. Like maybe, oh,

647
00:34:23,801 --> 00:34:25,870
maybe it'll be fine if we draft women.

648
00:34:26,080 --> 00:34:30,250
Like maybe it'll be fine if we just
pretend we just are totally gender neutral

649
00:34:30,251 --> 00:34:34,810
with our kids and pretend like no
binary definition of gender exists. Um,

650
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:37,630
but I do wonder if science will
catch up with us and be like,

651
00:34:37,930 --> 00:34:42,220
actually all these things
that conservatives were
saying that the left dot we're

652
00:34:42,221 --> 00:34:44,720
social constructs,
they're just biological reality.

653
00:34:44,990 --> 00:34:45,141
Well,

654
00:34:45,141 --> 00:34:48,590
they also made find out what if they found
out that there was a gay gene one day?

655
00:34:48,780 --> 00:34:50,340
Yeah. Now they're pro choice. Would you,

656
00:34:50,390 --> 00:34:55,090
you have to be okay then with a
woman deciding to abort that baby

657
00:34:55,380 --> 00:34:57,040
because they don't want
the child to be gay.

658
00:34:57,041 --> 00:35:00,280
And that does put them in this
kind of ethical conundrum. I mean,

659
00:35:00,281 --> 00:35:02,830
but it's the same thing
with, with race. I mean,

660
00:35:02,831 --> 00:35:05,710
I guess you would know what race your
child is obviously before you had an

661
00:35:05,711 --> 00:35:09,310
ultrasound or anything like
that. But, uh, you have, I mean,

662
00:35:09,311 --> 00:35:13,390
there is a racial aspects to abortion
and that the majority of abortions happen

663
00:35:13,391 --> 00:35:17,530
in minority communities. And so when
you ask a pro choice or about that,

664
00:35:17,890 --> 00:35:20,320
they don't typically have
any kind of answer though.

665
00:35:21,220 --> 00:35:26,110
Wage gap. Uh, you briefly mentioned
the trends situation or gender roles.

666
00:35:26,590 --> 00:35:29,830
Yeah. The trends issue for
considering it's, you know,

667
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:33,810
0.01% of the population or something.
And I have complete sympathy yeah.

668
00:35:34,090 --> 00:35:38,010
With the issues that they're dealing
with a little overblown in our national

669
00:35:38,011 --> 00:35:38,844
discussion.

670
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:41,080
Yes.
And I think that the left does that a lot.

671
00:35:41,120 --> 00:35:43,030
Maybe I'm going to give them
the benefit of the doubt.

672
00:35:43,031 --> 00:35:46,870
Maybe with good intentions because
people with gender dysphoria,

673
00:35:46,900 --> 00:35:48,010
it truly is a struggle.

674
00:35:48,011 --> 00:35:52,900
I know someone with gender dysphoria and
it is a struggle. They didn't want this,

675
00:35:52,901 --> 00:35:53,440
they didn't,

676
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:57,250
they don't like this kind of struggle of
feeling like they don't belong in their

677
00:35:57,251 --> 00:36:01,390
own body. It really is a psychological
struggle, but you treat it as a struggle.

678
00:36:01,510 --> 00:36:03,430
You treat it as something that,
okay,

679
00:36:03,670 --> 00:36:07,450
we don't just say while live what you
want to live because they actually,

680
00:36:07,451 --> 00:36:10,930
the rates of suicide are pretty
much equal afterwards. Um,

681
00:36:10,931 --> 00:36:13,570
it doesn't actually reconcile
anything when we say, okay,

682
00:36:13,571 --> 00:36:18,010
just do what you want to do because it
truly is it disorder in a dysphoria. Um,

683
00:36:18,070 --> 00:36:22,120
and I think maybe in an attempt to be
compassionate to the people that are

684
00:36:22,121 --> 00:36:25,840
dealing with this and to help them
not feel ashamed that left who said,

685
00:36:25,841 --> 00:36:28,510
you know what,
we're just going to validate who you are.

686
00:36:28,750 --> 00:36:32,620
I personally don't think
that's the compassionate thing
to do, to lie to someone.

687
00:36:32,621 --> 00:36:35,470
And I know a lot of conservatives
feel the same way. Um,

688
00:36:35,500 --> 00:36:39,310
but then you do start finding yourself
getting angry and defensive about a

689
00:36:39,311 --> 00:36:42,280
subject that we should have a lot of
sympathy for because people force you to

690
00:36:42,281 --> 00:36:44,520
use gender pronouns that
you don't want to use a,

691
00:36:44,630 --> 00:36:46,750
they force you to have conversations
that you don't want to have.

692
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:48,820
And that's where things
just get really sticky.

693
00:36:48,821 --> 00:36:51,880
And that's when unfortunately
conservatives including me,

694
00:36:51,881 --> 00:36:54,940
we get really dogmatic about it and the
sympathy and compassion is thrown out

695
00:36:54,941 --> 00:36:55,590
the window.

696
00:36:55,590 --> 00:36:57,300
Yeah.
So what do you do to fight that?

697
00:36:57,330 --> 00:37:01,280
Cause that I get that it's tough if you
just keep being called to transfer over

698
00:37:01,281 --> 00:37:04,320
or any of these phobes well
eventually you're just like,

699
00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:08,380
all right then enough of this I'm
going to go for the destroys tweet and

700
00:37:08,490 --> 00:37:09,930
scattered the compassion tweet.

701
00:37:10,170 --> 00:37:13,170
Well the tweets are difficult
because the tweets is like

702
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:18,780
you only have so many
characters and putting out the
nuanced compassionate tweet

703
00:37:18,781 --> 00:37:20,850
is typically not what comes to mind.

704
00:37:20,851 --> 00:37:24,120
I think when you're just trained to
put your, put your idea out there,

705
00:37:24,121 --> 00:37:26,100
you don't have time to add.
The new ones are like,

706
00:37:26,101 --> 00:37:28,140
I'm just going to get to the
point I want saying that's right.

707
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:31,320
But that's typically my tendency and
our tendency and I don't think that's a

708
00:37:31,321 --> 00:37:31,831
good thing.

709
00:37:31,831 --> 00:37:35,460
But in conversations I always think it's
really important to define your terms.

710
00:37:35,461 --> 00:37:38,640
If you have a same leftist who was
saying you're a trans folk. Okay,

711
00:37:38,641 --> 00:37:42,420
well we need to define phobia and we
need to define what I believe in what you

712
00:37:42,421 --> 00:37:45,660
believe and maybe we actually
agree on a lot of the same things.

713
00:37:45,661 --> 00:37:48,690
We just disagree on the facts.
We just disagree on the variables.

714
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:50,730
So I think defining
the terms is important.

715
00:37:50,731 --> 00:37:55,230
It starting with what you
agree is important. Uh, and
then working out from there.

716
00:37:55,290 --> 00:37:56,990
How often do we do that?
Maybe not enough.

717
00:37:57,450 --> 00:38:00,450
Would you, do you think it's fair to
say that the average conservative, well,

718
00:38:00,451 --> 00:38:02,990
first off, you know, the, the, when they
keep putting fold at the end of the world,

719
00:38:03,030 --> 00:38:04,380
phobe is an irrational fear.

720
00:38:04,410 --> 00:38:08,100
So I assume you don't think
that the average conservative
has an irrational fear

721
00:38:08,101 --> 00:38:10,750
of trans people, right? No, I
don't think so. Okay. So what,

722
00:38:10,751 --> 00:38:13,560
what do you think the average,
do you think the average PR, uh,

723
00:38:13,580 --> 00:38:16,530
conservative has the thoughts
that you laid out earlier,

724
00:38:16,531 --> 00:38:18,150
which is sort of a sympathy for this,

725
00:38:18,151 --> 00:38:23,151
but then we don't want that to override
our thinking brains on there like that.

726
00:38:23,660 --> 00:38:25,940
I think some people are
saying you don't want,

727
00:38:25,941 --> 00:38:27,710
I really don't care if
you dress like a girl.

728
00:38:27,711 --> 00:38:31,250
Are you dressed like a guy or you
want to call yourself something? Um,

729
00:38:31,310 --> 00:38:35,440
I just don't want you to force that on me.
I don't want you to take away,

730
00:38:35,441 --> 00:38:39,650
for example, my religious liberty
in lieu of like I, I, I don't know,

731
00:38:39,690 --> 00:38:43,930
they don't want their rights trampled
upon in favor of this small group.

732
00:38:44,470 --> 00:38:45,940
Uh,
however,

733
00:38:45,941 --> 00:38:50,010
I do think there are people that kind
of see where this line of reasoning goes

734
00:38:50,020 --> 00:38:53,200
that if, okay, we denied
biological realities,

735
00:38:53,201 --> 00:38:57,520
we deny what science is telling us and
we buy into this delusion that a man can

736
00:38:57,521 --> 00:39:00,040
just wake up one day and
say that he is a woman,

737
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:04,960
then okay we kind of lose, we kind of
lose all truth. What is truth anymore?

738
00:39:04,961 --> 00:39:08,830
It's just what you feel. We lose
identity. It's just who you say you are.

739
00:39:08,860 --> 00:39:13,630
Or are you actually defined in any way
by biology and I think they see the kind

740
00:39:13,631 --> 00:39:16,630
of slippery slope that goes down and
they say, okay, stop right there.

741
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:17,950
I'm not down with this.

742
00:39:18,170 --> 00:39:21,740
Did you all sounds crazy to just wake
up and you know, middle age and be like,

743
00:39:21,741 --> 00:39:26,210
well now email. But it's
like at that point, I mean
this is, this sounds bananas,

744
00:39:26,211 --> 00:39:30,560
but if you were a washed up
male NBA player, good and
play in the league anymore,

745
00:39:30,770 --> 00:39:34,130
you can be like, yeah, I'm a woman
today. I identify as woman, right? Yeah,

746
00:39:34,190 --> 00:39:37,010
I'm jumping in then WMV and I'm
going to be the MVP. Watch this,

747
00:39:37,011 --> 00:39:41,060
and then the feminist would have to
say, yeah, your lived experience.

748
00:39:41,120 --> 00:39:44,690
Yeah. Well that's the other problem with
it is that you're kind of seeing some

749
00:39:44,691 --> 00:39:47,570
feminists pushback on this
and say, hang on. Well,

750
00:39:47,571 --> 00:39:49,550
old school feminist have
been kind of saying, okay,

751
00:39:49,551 --> 00:39:51,590
we fought for the uniqueness of women,

752
00:39:51,591 --> 00:39:56,591
the empowerment of women because women
are women and now men are beating us at

753
00:39:56,811 --> 00:40:00,260
our own. Gay Men are better at being
women. Then women are, that's not fair.

754
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:02,990
And so I do think you see
feminist pushing back on that,

755
00:40:02,991 --> 00:40:04,790
who truly do believe that.
Okay.

756
00:40:04,910 --> 00:40:07,670
The reason why we fought for the
empowerment of women is because women are

757
00:40:07,671 --> 00:40:10,490
unique. Only women can have children.
Only women can do certain things.

758
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:13,700
Women are better at some things than
men are. As far as leadership goes.

759
00:40:13,701 --> 00:40:15,740
As far as organization goes,
things like that.

760
00:40:16,070 --> 00:40:18,320
And they fought to bring
those things to the forefront.

761
00:40:18,500 --> 00:40:21,440
And now none of those things matter
anymore because you can be a man to be a

762
00:40:21,441 --> 00:40:24,970
woman. So there is just, I'm
just so glad I'm not on the lot.

763
00:40:24,990 --> 00:40:26,360
It just seems so confusing.

764
00:40:27,210 --> 00:40:30,670
That's quite miserable. It is. All right,

765
00:40:30,671 --> 00:40:34,510
so your Prager u video make men masculine
again. Why did they have a man do that?

766
00:40:34,540 --> 00:40:37,630
Why did they have a, what was the
idea? We're going to have a woman. Yes.

767
00:40:37,660 --> 00:40:39,580
Talk about male,
male masculinity.

768
00:40:39,700 --> 00:40:44,140
I think it's because you're seeing a lot
of women talk about how terrible toxic

769
00:40:44,141 --> 00:40:47,620
masculinity is and say, Oh man, they just,

770
00:40:47,650 --> 00:40:51,520
they don't even know how hard today
today's in. David pressed us for so long,

771
00:40:51,820 --> 00:40:56,170
we just need them to take a back seat
and so we can kind of step up and do our

772
00:40:56,171 --> 00:40:59,950
thing. And so I think they wanted
the perspective of a woman to say,

773
00:40:59,951 --> 00:41:04,900
hang on just a second. Women actually
do, not only do we like masculine men,

774
00:41:05,110 --> 00:41:08,350
um, or not even necessarily
traditional masculinity.

775
00:41:08,351 --> 00:41:10,660
I'm not talking about like
riding a four wheeler,

776
00:41:10,661 --> 00:41:14,530
I'm talking about taking responsibility
for your actions and taking care of your

777
00:41:14,531 --> 00:41:15,360
family.

778
00:41:15,360 --> 00:41:19,660
I'm taking care of that provision and
protection that men are so good at it.

779
00:41:19,661 --> 00:41:21,400
And I think better at than women are.

780
00:41:22,270 --> 00:41:25,150
So you could still wear a
nice shirt, let's say. Yes,

781
00:41:25,330 --> 00:41:26,210
you should be able to take care of it.

782
00:41:26,340 --> 00:41:28,530
Yeah. It's more internal
traits than anything else.

783
00:41:28,531 --> 00:41:31,800
And the actions and the habits that you
have, the responsibilities that you take,

784
00:41:31,950 --> 00:41:34,010
women do care about it.
Actually,

785
00:41:34,130 --> 00:41:38,750
the complimentarian relationship
that men and women have had for ever,

786
00:41:39,050 --> 00:41:43,160
um, has, has worked really well.
It's worked really well. Not always.

787
00:41:43,161 --> 00:41:45,980
I mean sometimes it goes over to
a patriarchy and that's not good.

788
00:41:45,981 --> 00:41:49,400
I don't think oppression of women is
good, but the, the ying and the Yang,

789
00:41:49,430 --> 00:41:51,830
the back and forth and uh,

790
00:41:51,831 --> 00:41:55,340
the complimentarian relationship
that we've had has worked.

791
00:41:55,341 --> 00:41:57,600
And I think you kind of needed
to hear a woman say that.

792
00:41:57,630 --> 00:41:59,640
So why do you think the
left's trying to destroy that?

793
00:42:00,110 --> 00:42:03,020
Because they think egalitarian
is a more equal equality.

794
00:42:03,021 --> 00:42:04,700
So it's equality through homogeny,

795
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:08,180
which is part of why abortion is a
really big thing that they fight for.

796
00:42:08,181 --> 00:42:10,910
If a man can physically walk
away from an unwanted pregnancy,

797
00:42:11,150 --> 00:42:14,120
oh woman should be able
to too. I mean, pregnancy,

798
00:42:14,121 --> 00:42:17,870
the ability to get pregnant is really one,
not one of the only things,

799
00:42:17,871 --> 00:42:20,930
but probably the biggest thing
that makes a woman different.

800
00:42:21,140 --> 00:42:25,160
And so if we get rid of that through
abortion and then maybe men and women

801
00:42:25,161 --> 00:42:27,980
really well be the same and
maybe they really will be equal,

802
00:42:27,981 --> 00:42:31,940
then there'll be no abuse, no oppression,
no patriarchy, things like that.

803
00:42:32,210 --> 00:42:36,440
But I mean men are always going to be
physically stronger than women and there's

804
00:42:36,441 --> 00:42:40,310
always going to be bad men and bad women.
So oppression won't stop.

805
00:42:40,550 --> 00:42:43,540
Abuse won't stop. Egalitarianism
is just going to make, or not,

806
00:42:43,600 --> 00:42:44,900
I shouldn't say egalitarianism,

807
00:42:44,901 --> 00:42:48,380
but sameness is going to make
things more confusing, not better.

808
00:42:48,860 --> 00:42:52,480
So I know you do a public speaking too,
and when you go to colleges,

809
00:42:52,490 --> 00:42:56,060
do you find you have any
tricks on how to wake up,

810
00:42:56,150 --> 00:43:01,010
say some of the lefties
that are, you know, at least
open to some of these ideas,

811
00:43:01,011 --> 00:43:02,780
but they're kind of like,
oh, she must be the bad guy,

812
00:43:02,781 --> 00:43:04,580
but I'll at least go and
sit in the back of the room.

813
00:43:05,180 --> 00:43:08,300
Well,
what I try to do is I try to,

814
00:43:08,330 --> 00:43:12,950
my messages typically when I can
usually speaking to mostly conservative,

815
00:43:12,951 --> 00:43:13,790
it's a is that okay,

816
00:43:13,791 --> 00:43:16,880
you're hearing that you're crazy for
believing and things like border security

817
00:43:16,881 --> 00:43:19,250
for being pro life,
for being pro capitalism.

818
00:43:19,580 --> 00:43:23,270
But here's where these ideas come from
and here's how they have worked and

819
00:43:23,271 --> 00:43:28,271
really only over the past 10 to 15
years have we heard all of this crazy

820
00:43:28,341 --> 00:43:29,300
intersectionality,

821
00:43:29,301 --> 00:43:32,990
identity politic stuff that they
are acting like his main stream.

822
00:43:33,110 --> 00:43:35,540
And so you're not the extremist,
you're not the radical,

823
00:43:35,541 --> 00:43:38,030
you're not the one that's out there.
You're not the Nazi and the bigot.

824
00:43:38,050 --> 00:43:41,960
You believe things that Americans have
believed since our founding and they have

825
00:43:41,961 --> 00:43:44,150
a really good history
and a really good basis.

826
00:43:44,151 --> 00:43:48,560
And so I don't know if that has
necessarily ever changed a leftist mind,

827
00:43:48,860 --> 00:43:52,550
but it is something that's different
than just talking points and saying the

828
00:43:52,551 --> 00:43:54,710
left is stupid. It's saying, hey,

829
00:43:54,711 --> 00:43:58,220
we have good ideas and you have a right
to believe they're good ideas and you

830
00:43:58,221 --> 00:44:02,010
have a right to defend these
good ideas. Um, really the,

831
00:44:02,011 --> 00:44:05,690
the most disrespectful or the craziest.

832
00:44:05,691 --> 00:44:07,520
I always get very respectful,

833
00:44:07,640 --> 00:44:11,120
great liberal students that come and
listen and ask awesome questions.

834
00:44:11,121 --> 00:44:14,780
I think the only time that has been like,
oh my gosh,

835
00:44:14,781 --> 00:44:18,500
I can't even get a word out without these
people screaming is when I was at UC

836
00:44:18,500 --> 00:44:21,110
Berkeley and I spoke to or done that.
Yes.

837
00:44:21,111 --> 00:44:24,290
And I spoke to a class and the professor
was awesome for asking me and I

838
00:44:24,291 --> 00:44:26,180
actually thought when I went in
there, I was like, I'm gonna,

839
00:44:26,470 --> 00:44:29,420
I gotta be really tame. I'm going
to be really tame with what I say.

840
00:44:29,421 --> 00:44:32,640
I'm not going to say I'm not gonna
throw any flames or anything like that.

841
00:44:32,910 --> 00:44:37,770
Oh my gosh, I couldn't even, it was like
they had never heard a conservative idea.

842
00:44:37,771 --> 00:44:40,860
They'd never heard, uh,
someone who wasn't a liberal,

843
00:44:40,861 --> 00:44:43,830
utter a word and it was irrational.
It was irrational.

844
00:44:43,950 --> 00:44:47,670
That was really my only experience
where I was like, this is crazy.

845
00:44:47,700 --> 00:44:48,570
They've abandoned thought.

846
00:44:48,610 --> 00:44:52,510
Do you in a weird way, blame the baby
boomers for this cause it's their kids,

847
00:44:52,511 --> 00:44:56,380
right? Like, or it's the end of there.
The young end of their children,

848
00:44:56,381 --> 00:44:58,700
like sort of weird way.
You can't blame the,

849
00:44:58,720 --> 00:45:02,740
the 16 year old who now gets into college,
you know, a couple of years go by,

850
00:45:02,741 --> 00:45:05,560
he's been indoctrinated in high school,
gets to college,

851
00:45:05,561 --> 00:45:08,860
gets slammed with more of this
stuff. I have sympathy for him. Well,

852
00:45:08,861 --> 00:45:10,650
when they're yelling at me,
I don't have that much sympathy for them.

853
00:45:10,690 --> 00:45:14,380
But like I have sympathy
for that condition because
they were just thrown into

854
00:45:14,381 --> 00:45:17,560
that. Um, we're not that you're
looking to blame somebody,

855
00:45:17,561 --> 00:45:19,930
but if you had to sort of figure
out where this whole thing started,

856
00:45:20,200 --> 00:45:21,033
where would you go?

857
00:45:21,150 --> 00:45:21,361
Well,

858
00:45:21,361 --> 00:45:25,020
it's the baby boomers really like to
talk about how terrible millennials are.

859
00:45:25,050 --> 00:45:26,520
And I agree with them to some degree.

860
00:45:26,521 --> 00:45:29,800
I mean a lot of the stereotypes
that people have of us stare, uh,

861
00:45:29,940 --> 00:45:32,400
entitled and apathetic or true,

862
00:45:32,670 --> 00:45:37,110
but I remind them like we were raised,
we were raised by someone,

863
00:45:37,111 --> 00:45:42,090
we weren't raised by wolves and I don't
think it's so much that parents probably,

864
00:45:42,110 --> 00:45:46,500
um, told their kids to be entitled
or told their kids to be spoiled.

865
00:45:46,501 --> 00:45:50,220
I don't know if it was a lack of
values that were taught in the family,

866
00:45:50,460 --> 00:45:54,330
but also there was a significant change
from the time our parents were kids.

867
00:45:54,331 --> 00:45:56,940
Like my mom for example, was, you know,

868
00:45:56,941 --> 00:46:00,060
she was driving to the liquor store to
get her dad beer when she was like 13

869
00:46:00,061 --> 00:46:03,840
years old. I mean, car seats, like
that just wasn't even a thing. I mean,

870
00:46:03,870 --> 00:46:06,420
everything was a lot more free
to the time where we were kids.

871
00:46:06,600 --> 00:46:10,800
I remember there was like a new law that
said you have to be in a car seat until

872
00:46:10,801 --> 00:46:14,640
you're like in second grade or
something like that. Everything changed.

873
00:46:14,641 --> 00:46:19,410
Everything became more safe and everything
shifted from like the latch key kids

874
00:46:19,590 --> 00:46:22,080
who were coming home and
fending for themselves.

875
00:46:22,081 --> 00:46:25,860
That's mostly generation x because both
their parents had jobs to kind of these

876
00:46:25,861 --> 00:46:30,020
helicopter parents and these,
everybody gets a trophy or this,

877
00:46:30,030 --> 00:46:33,210
everybody gets a trophy
mentality that we had in school.

878
00:46:33,660 --> 00:46:36,220
It's not like we didn't have competition,
but it was the,

879
00:46:36,221 --> 00:46:39,600
everyone gets some kind of reward. I
would know. I'm terrible at running.

880
00:46:39,601 --> 00:46:43,680
I'm so slow and yet in every race
and I thought I got honorable,

881
00:46:44,610 --> 00:46:47,520
honorable mention, I got something
and that's how we were raised.

882
00:46:47,560 --> 00:46:52,240
I swear to God, so I'm, I'm Gen x so
I'm a little old, but I swear to God.

883
00:46:52,241 --> 00:46:55,540
I remember being in third or
fourth grade field day and I was,

884
00:46:55,541 --> 00:46:57,970
I was a scrawny little kid.
I was not a good athlete.

885
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:02,830
I became a good athlete later and I
remember getting a slip at field day.

886
00:47:02,831 --> 00:47:03,551
I did not place,

887
00:47:03,551 --> 00:47:07,060
I didn't get a medal and I
remember getting some sort
of participation thing and

888
00:47:07,061 --> 00:47:07,781
I'm not kidding.

889
00:47:07,781 --> 00:47:11,260
I remember as a third or fourth grader
thinking this is nonsense. Like,

890
00:47:11,261 --> 00:47:15,880
why would you give me this? I felt
shitty. I felt bad. I sucked it. Whatever.

891
00:47:15,881 --> 00:47:18,400
We were doing like a slow
bike race and I sucked.

892
00:47:18,401 --> 00:47:21,220
So why didn't any of that yet?
We've,

893
00:47:21,550 --> 00:47:24,550
we've sold this as if this
is how it's supposed to be.

894
00:47:24,640 --> 00:47:29,230
Yeah, I think, I mean it's parenting.
It's technology, its values, its purpose,

895
00:47:29,410 --> 00:47:31,570
so much.
I mean you do also,

896
00:47:31,571 --> 00:47:34,990
you can't deny just the effect the
personal technology had on millennials.

897
00:47:34,991 --> 00:47:39,340
And we had iPhone from the time that we
were probably 15. We had cell phones.

898
00:47:39,341 --> 00:47:41,440
Even before that we had my space.

899
00:47:41,590 --> 00:47:46,210
Zenga if anyone remembers that you guys
face, oh, I think it was before my today.

900
00:47:46,211 --> 00:47:49,840
I didn't have it, but I remember some
people did. You had AOL instant messenger.

901
00:47:49,841 --> 00:47:54,190
So you had personalized technology from
a really young age that told us that

902
00:47:54,191 --> 00:47:58,300
everything is about you. Um,
everything is focused on you.

903
00:47:58,301 --> 00:48:01,090
And then the older that we got, we
got Netflix, we've got Uber eats,

904
00:48:01,091 --> 00:48:03,520
we got all of these things that
made life really convenient.

905
00:48:03,700 --> 00:48:07,330
Instant gratification. Always. We
don't know anything other than Amazon.

906
00:48:07,480 --> 00:48:10,080
I don't know how to
read a map like I don't.

907
00:48:10,090 --> 00:48:13,480
I remember my dad tried to teach me how
to read a map in high school. I was like,

908
00:48:13,660 --> 00:48:14,890
yeah, dad. Okay.

909
00:48:15,130 --> 00:48:18,930
I remember that a map is had to refold it.
The rest it's like whatever,

910
00:48:18,931 --> 00:48:20,970
but you can just fold it
back in the way it came out.

911
00:48:21,390 --> 00:48:24,510
Well, I don't even know how to do that.
So, and I think most millennials don't,

912
00:48:24,511 --> 00:48:29,511
and so this instant gratification things
should be easy for me as they are in

913
00:48:29,611 --> 00:48:32,550
the technological world has
really affected our politics too.

914
00:48:32,960 --> 00:48:37,550
Do you feel that the technological part
of this has actually really screwed up a

915
00:48:37,551 --> 00:48:38,960
generation then like that?

916
00:48:38,990 --> 00:48:42,020
There's obviously a lot of goodness and
we're doing this on youtube. Yeah, yeah.

917
00:48:42,050 --> 00:48:45,620
All of that. But that it really like
we have where we handed everybody,

918
00:48:45,621 --> 00:48:46,550
it didn't matter what age you are.

919
00:48:46,551 --> 00:48:50,990
We all got handed this
incredible technology that
opened the world, our heads,

920
00:48:50,991 --> 00:48:54,920
but especially if you're a 15 year
old being handed that. Yeah, that's,

921
00:48:54,950 --> 00:48:56,420
that's a lot to give a kid.

922
00:48:56,510 --> 00:48:56,940
Yeah.

923
00:48:56,940 --> 00:49:01,940
I want to hesitate to blame
all of all of it on technology.

924
00:49:02,271 --> 00:49:06,380
I also see a loss of values and that
we're not only the most progressive

925
00:49:06,381 --> 00:49:08,930
generation, but we're also the
most irreligious generation.

926
00:49:08,931 --> 00:49:13,820
We're the biggest generation of religious
nones in o n e s and I do think a lot

927
00:49:13,821 --> 00:49:18,020
of us are wandering looking for truth,
not really knowing what that is. Not me,

928
00:49:18,021 --> 00:49:19,760
but a lot of people in our generation.

929
00:49:19,940 --> 00:49:23,900
I don't know if that comes with
technology at all or if that's connected,

930
00:49:23,901 --> 00:49:27,740
but it's certainly a factor and why you
think millennials just don't have any

931
00:49:27,741 --> 00:49:31,400
center. They don't have any grounding
and they just think that their center is

932
00:49:31,401 --> 00:49:34,610
themselves. They were told this
all the time on social media.

933
00:49:34,611 --> 00:49:38,480
I mean your favorite fitness blog or your
favorite self help author is just love

934
00:49:38,481 --> 00:49:40,520
yourself. If you just look
in the mirror in the morning,

935
00:49:40,521 --> 00:49:42,820
you tell yourself you're awesome,
that you're enough,

936
00:49:42,821 --> 00:49:45,380
then you're going to be fine
and that's what you need to do.

937
00:49:45,650 --> 00:49:49,310
Everything's about my happiness. So you
cut out the toxic people in your life,

938
00:49:49,311 --> 00:49:51,110
you cut out the things
that you don't like,

939
00:49:51,170 --> 00:49:55,550
the things that make you sad and you
just do, you can be pretty lonely.

940
00:49:55,730 --> 00:49:59,360
Yeah. I mean there's, right and w I mean,

941
00:49:59,361 --> 00:50:01,460
what do you do when
the self love runs out?

942
00:50:01,461 --> 00:50:03,140
What do you do when the
self esteem runs out?

943
00:50:03,320 --> 00:50:05,750
What do you do when you wake up in
the morning and you're like, okay,

944
00:50:05,751 --> 00:50:09,260
I'm not that awesome and I
haven't accomplished that much.

945
00:50:09,410 --> 00:50:12,980
Should you just continue to
coddle yourself? Or should
you do something about it?

946
00:50:12,981 --> 00:50:15,110
In the millennial is told cuddle,

947
00:50:15,111 --> 00:50:17,630
you'll be flying and then you have
someone like AOC saying, well,

948
00:50:17,631 --> 00:50:20,720
we're going to provide economic security
for people who are unwilling to work.

949
00:50:20,721 --> 00:50:25,100
And so if you just want to
be, uh, a watercolor painter,

950
00:50:25,101 --> 00:50:27,650
even if you suck at it,
you should just doing it.

951
00:50:27,790 --> 00:50:32,080
Yeah. So that's where a lot of money
in watercolor painting generally,

952
00:50:32,150 --> 00:50:36,440
I wouldn't know because I'm not good
at it yet. But, um, I can imagine

953
00:50:37,260 --> 00:50:41,670
gay marriage, let's talk about
it from a Christian perspective.

954
00:50:41,730 --> 00:50:44,760
So when we're posting this, uh, we're
holding this video for a couple of days,

955
00:50:44,761 --> 00:50:47,210
but I just had a Shapiro
right here and yeah,

956
00:50:47,280 --> 00:50:51,450
we've talked about gay marriage and he
talks about his feelings from it Orthodox

957
00:50:51,451 --> 00:50:53,340
Jewish perspective.
And we can,

958
00:50:53,430 --> 00:50:57,830
we've basically gotten it to the place
where we agree to disagree and well,

959
00:50:57,840 --> 00:50:59,070
we agree to disagree on the,

960
00:50:59,071 --> 00:51:02,490
on the fact that he's not okay with
it through a religious perspective,

961
00:51:02,700 --> 00:51:06,570
but he's not trying to legislate my
life and I as a citizen of this country,

962
00:51:06,690 --> 00:51:11,070
I'm completely okay with that. Yeah, I
suspect that's probably similar to yours.

963
00:51:11,250 --> 00:51:15,690
It is similar now as a Christian,
there is a little bit of,

964
00:51:16,050 --> 00:51:18,600
um,
I would say a second layer to that.

965
00:51:18,601 --> 00:51:22,710
So he obviously believes
that homosexuality is wrong
because the old testament

966
00:51:22,711 --> 00:51:25,170
says it. We believe it, not
just because the old testament,

967
00:51:25,171 --> 00:51:27,060
but it's reiterated in the New Testament.

968
00:51:27,061 --> 00:51:31,680
And then there is this crazy picture
in metaphor that is given to us in

969
00:51:31,681 --> 00:51:33,930
Ephesians five that says,
okay,

970
00:51:33,931 --> 00:51:38,370
marriage is a reflection of what
Christians called Christ in the Church as

971
00:51:38,370 --> 00:51:41,490
Christ is the head of the church.
So the husband is the head of the wife,

972
00:51:41,670 --> 00:51:43,380
and so it's this,
um,

973
00:51:43,470 --> 00:51:47,130
husbands are to love their wives as
Christ loves the church and wives are

974
00:51:47,131 --> 00:51:49,380
supposed to submit to their
husbands as to the Lord.

975
00:51:49,381 --> 00:51:51,270
So that there is this spiritual component.

976
00:51:51,271 --> 00:51:55,590
There's gospel component to marriage
being between a man and a woman.

977
00:51:55,770 --> 00:51:59,580
So there really is no theological
way for any Christian. They try,

978
00:51:59,820 --> 00:52:02,520
but to get out of the
dynamic that God set up,

979
00:52:02,521 --> 00:52:05,640
not just biologically and physically,
but also spiritually.

980
00:52:05,910 --> 00:52:09,240
And so that's where I stand as
far as your religious perspective.

981
00:52:09,420 --> 00:52:10,860
Now I've heard both sides of it.

982
00:52:10,890 --> 00:52:15,890
I have heard conservatives and even
libertarians and that I respect saying,

983
00:52:16,170 --> 00:52:19,060
you know what?
I just can't get behind a,

984
00:52:19,120 --> 00:52:24,120
I just can't get behind gay marriage
from even a civics perspective or from a

985
00:52:24,151 --> 00:52:27,750
legal perspective. You heard Libertarians
make that argument? I've heard that.

986
00:52:27,751 --> 00:52:30,300
I've heard liberty here.
I would say not anyone famous.

987
00:52:30,301 --> 00:52:34,290
I would say friends who
probably have libertarian views
still say maybe that was,

988
00:52:34,320 --> 00:52:35,820
maybe they don't feel that way anymore.

989
00:52:35,821 --> 00:52:39,480
But just say it's so hard for me to
separate the personal from the political,

990
00:52:39,481 --> 00:52:42,420
but where I stand politically
is probably the same.

991
00:52:42,540 --> 00:52:45,810
I would say probably the same
place as Ben dies. I mean,

992
00:52:45,811 --> 00:52:47,760
one gay marriage is here to stay.

993
00:52:47,761 --> 00:52:51,090
There's nothing that's going to be
done about it. And I don't think I,

994
00:52:51,091 --> 00:52:54,810
or probably any other evangelical in
the political world is going to fight

995
00:52:54,811 --> 00:52:56,140
against it.
But I think

996
00:52:56,460 --> 00:52:59,400
does that tell you quickly about
the evangelicals in general?

997
00:52:59,401 --> 00:53:02,130
Because I think this is important.
I've, I've said this many times,

998
00:53:02,131 --> 00:53:05,790
but it's like nobody cares
about gay marriage anymore
really in the big picture.

999
00:53:05,791 --> 00:53:09,090
Like I get your, your theological,
yeah. Personal belief,

1000
00:53:09,330 --> 00:53:11,330
but in the public political space,
yeah.

1001
00:53:11,460 --> 00:53:16,460
Something that was anathema to this
group of people for a long time now has

1002
00:53:16,531 --> 00:53:19,500
become normalized pretty quickly,
I think. I think by and large,

1003
00:53:19,501 --> 00:53:22,620
Christians have realized that their
communities aren't getting worse,

1004
00:53:22,621 --> 00:53:25,440
that the neighbors next door have
kids and they're the same as else.

1005
00:53:25,770 --> 00:53:30,720
That you don't even hear Mike
Huckabee going on about it
anymore. Or, or, or, um, uh,

1006
00:53:30,750 --> 00:53:33,720
Rick Santorum or any of these guys.
They've sort of moved on.

1007
00:53:33,721 --> 00:53:36,960
And I think this is where I would love
the progressive's to have a little

1008
00:53:36,961 --> 00:53:41,070
humility. Yeah. Like just a
little bit of, you know what me,

1009
00:53:41,080 --> 00:53:43,410
maybe you guys were wrong,
right? You were wrong,

1010
00:53:43,411 --> 00:53:46,740
but then something happened and
you let it go. Yeah. Basically.

1011
00:53:46,980 --> 00:53:51,150
And that would show a little humanity
and humility and they just refused to do

1012
00:53:51,151 --> 00:53:52,350
that. Yeah. And again,

1013
00:53:52,351 --> 00:53:56,040
this is where then I can
find myself building bridges
with you guys all the time

1014
00:53:56,041 --> 00:53:58,790
because, yeah. Because there's
a place to build the bridge to.

1015
00:53:58,910 --> 00:53:59,540
Yeah.

1016
00:53:59,540 --> 00:54:04,340
I think that a lot of evangelical
conservatives realized,

1017
00:54:04,370 --> 00:54:05,390
okay,
yes,

1018
00:54:05,660 --> 00:54:09,320
America was founded on Christian values
and we should continue to perpetuate

1019
00:54:09,321 --> 00:54:12,140
those Christian values.
But the state does not define marriage.

1020
00:54:12,440 --> 00:54:16,820
God defines marriage. And I think that,
uh, churches should it be free to say,

1021
00:54:16,850 --> 00:54:20,220
sorry, we're not gonna, we're not going
to marry two men. You know, and I agree.

1022
00:54:20,360 --> 00:54:23,300
Right. And Yeah. And I
knew that you did. Um,

1023
00:54:23,360 --> 00:54:26,270
and I think that we kind of made that
separation and say, and said, okay,

1024
00:54:26,330 --> 00:54:28,010
God defines marriage in the Bible.

1025
00:54:28,160 --> 00:54:32,390
If I don't want to get on board with
it because I am beholden to God and God

1026
00:54:32,391 --> 00:54:34,430
above the state,
then that's fine.

1027
00:54:34,431 --> 00:54:37,340
And churches shouldn't be beholden
to the state in that regard either.

1028
00:54:37,550 --> 00:54:40,430
And I think that we kind of
decided, okay, that's fine.

1029
00:54:40,460 --> 00:54:43,850
If they want to get married according
to the state's definition of marriage,

1030
00:54:44,330 --> 00:54:45,230
that's okay,

1031
00:54:45,380 --> 00:54:49,430
but I in my congregation are not going
to change our views on it and we just

1032
00:54:49,431 --> 00:54:52,070
kind of want to be left
alone in that regard.

1033
00:54:52,180 --> 00:54:53,920
Yeah. So what would you,
what do you make of when,

1034
00:54:53,950 --> 00:54:56,810
when churches do perform
gay marriages? Like, yeah,

1035
00:54:56,820 --> 00:55:01,820
we just sort of skirting their
theological honesty or integrity.

1036
00:55:02,660 --> 00:55:03,493
Oh yeah.
I mean,

1037
00:55:03,650 --> 00:55:06,680
this is a huge thing in the United
Methodist church is that they've kind of

1038
00:55:06,710 --> 00:55:11,600
almost had a split because they voted on
this so called traditional plan saying,

1039
00:55:11,601 --> 00:55:13,430
okay,
if you're a Methodist church,

1040
00:55:13,431 --> 00:55:17,000
if you're under the United Methodist
Church umbrella, this denomination,

1041
00:55:17,180 --> 00:55:21,080
you can't perform gay marriage or
you can't, yeah, you can't perform.

1042
00:55:21,500 --> 00:55:22,640
You can perform in these marriages.

1043
00:55:22,641 --> 00:55:26,540
And there were a lot of people who
are really upset about that. And,

1044
00:55:26,780 --> 00:55:30,620
but from a Christian perspective,
you just can't get around it.

1045
00:55:30,621 --> 00:55:31,760
There's no way to get,

1046
00:55:31,761 --> 00:55:35,390
there's no way theologically to get
around it without making some serious,

1047
00:55:35,630 --> 00:55:38,570
not just physical concessions,
but spiritual concessions.

1048
00:55:38,571 --> 00:55:42,740
And so my question for anyone,
and it's not just about gay marriage,

1049
00:55:42,770 --> 00:55:46,310
it's about anything in the Bible.
My question is,

1050
00:55:46,311 --> 00:55:50,150
if you don't take the Bible
as God tells us to take it,

1051
00:55:50,180 --> 00:55:54,200
why are you a Christian? Find a different
hobby. Like there's that you can,

1052
00:55:54,260 --> 00:55:57,230
you know, you can be a
moral person. You can, yeah,

1053
00:55:57,231 --> 00:56:01,220
you can be a good person and you can
believe in feeding the poor without

1054
00:56:01,221 --> 00:56:03,770
following Christ.
But Christ tells us to deny yourself,

1055
00:56:03,771 --> 00:56:05,300
take up our cross and follow him.

1056
00:56:05,480 --> 00:56:08,660
And part of that is adhering to the
word even when it's inconvenient and not

1057
00:56:08,661 --> 00:56:09,590
culturally cool.

1058
00:56:09,920 --> 00:56:14,210
So I'm just a little bit confused
by those theological concessions.

1059
00:56:14,510 --> 00:56:17,060
Um, but yes, to answer your question,

1060
00:56:17,061 --> 00:56:19,820
I do think that it's compromising
on what the Bible says.

1061
00:56:20,100 --> 00:56:23,860
Yeah. What do you think that would
actually in practice, what does that mean?

1062
00:56:24,250 --> 00:56:25,630
You know what I mean?
Like, so in practice,

1063
00:56:25,631 --> 00:56:29,080
gay people started getting married now
doesn't matter outside of the church.

1064
00:56:29,410 --> 00:56:33,430
What do you think the practice of that
would lead to in society? That would be

1065
00:56:34,020 --> 00:56:36,030
all right. Are you talking about
okay. Outside of the church,

1066
00:56:36,100 --> 00:56:38,010
so like I understand. Yeah.
Outside of the church,

1067
00:56:38,040 --> 00:56:39,780
did you see that some sort of problem?

1068
00:56:40,390 --> 00:56:43,740
Well, I, I, I of course do you think
that God's way is better than way?

1069
00:56:43,760 --> 00:56:48,160
And I do believe that God's setting up
marriage as a union between a man and a

1070
00:56:48,161 --> 00:56:51,430
woman is better. I think
that it's better for, uh,

1071
00:56:51,460 --> 00:56:53,590
I think it's better for the family.
I think it's better for children.

1072
00:56:53,591 --> 00:56:56,680
And I think because it's better for the
family, it's better for society now.

1073
00:56:56,681 --> 00:57:00,190
Do I think it's going to be
the degradation of society?
Do I think that we're,

1074
00:57:00,560 --> 00:57:04,450
our whole thing is going to hell in
a hand basket because of that? Uh,

1075
00:57:04,570 --> 00:57:05,680
no I don't.

1076
00:57:05,681 --> 00:57:09,280
But of course I think that the way God
set up marriage and family and the Bible

1077
00:57:09,281 --> 00:57:13,570
is better than how secular
society does it. Um, and yeah,

1078
00:57:13,571 --> 00:57:16,510
so that's where I feel
that I feel like we are,

1079
00:57:16,511 --> 00:57:18,730
I feel like we'd probably be going.
However,

1080
00:57:18,880 --> 00:57:23,110
homosexuality is it different or are
necessarily worse than other sense is a

1081
00:57:23,111 --> 00:57:26,290
different kind of sand because it's a
sexual Santa according to Christianity,

1082
00:57:26,590 --> 00:57:27,790
but it's not worse.

1083
00:57:27,791 --> 00:57:31,000
We don't believe that it puts us in a
worse place than all of the other sense

1084
00:57:31,001 --> 00:57:31,320
that America

1085
00:57:31,320 --> 00:57:33,280
guys don't let so funny.
I know it's going to happen now,

1086
00:57:33,281 --> 00:57:35,350
so people are going to clip this
and there they are going to go out.

1087
00:57:35,360 --> 00:57:39,130
See there's Reuben sitting with another
homophobe to his face sitting in his

1088
00:57:39,131 --> 00:57:42,580
house where you live, you like hanging
out with homophobe, right? Yeah.

1089
00:57:42,600 --> 00:57:47,020
It's just like, I don't, I mean I said
it to Ben, so I'll say to you like,

1090
00:57:47,380 --> 00:57:51,330
as long as you're not trying to
legislate my life, I don't care. Yeah.

1091
00:57:51,810 --> 00:57:53,650
Maybe there's a part of me that I'm like,
maybe I should care more.

1092
00:57:53,651 --> 00:57:56,770
Should I be more offended or something
like that. Yeah. I just don't,

1093
00:57:56,960 --> 00:57:59,000
well,
I think part of it too is one,

1094
00:57:59,001 --> 00:58:02,900
you want to be left alone like so many
people like Christian has due to go live

1095
00:58:02,901 --> 00:58:06,140
your life. Yeah, you want to be
left alone. And I think also,

1096
00:58:06,290 --> 00:58:07,910
and you can correct me if I'm wrong,

1097
00:58:07,940 --> 00:58:11,540
but a lot of the problem that especially
Christians see on the left is that they

1098
00:58:11,541 --> 00:58:14,570
can fleet sexuality with identity.

1099
00:58:14,600 --> 00:58:19,100
And so if I disagree with your
relationship from a Christian perspective,

1100
00:58:19,520 --> 00:58:22,820
um, then that must mean that I
hate you, but I don't hate you.

1101
00:58:22,821 --> 00:58:24,020
I think that you're a great person.

1102
00:58:24,021 --> 00:58:27,380
I think you're a smart person and
your husband's awesome. And so they,

1103
00:58:27,381 --> 00:58:30,410
a lot of people on the left seem to not
be able to separate those two things.

1104
00:58:30,411 --> 00:58:34,820
That I can love you as a person and
respect you and admire you as a person and

1105
00:58:34,821 --> 00:58:38,750
not agree from my own Christian
perspective with your relationship. Now,

1106
00:58:38,810 --> 00:58:41,840
I also think it's important to say though,
it's not.

1107
00:58:42,110 --> 00:58:45,350
If I were to what Christians
would say witness to you,

1108
00:58:45,500 --> 00:58:50,180
if I were to share the gospel with you,
it would not be, hey Dave, you're gay.

1109
00:58:50,210 --> 00:58:54,890
And that's wrong. That would not be the
message. What we believe that unbelievers,

1110
00:58:54,891 --> 00:58:58,220
people who are not Christians are
repenting from when they come to Christ is

1111
00:58:58,280 --> 00:58:59,113
unbelief.

1112
00:58:59,210 --> 00:59:04,060
It is not your primarily your primary
Santa is that you're gay or that two are a

1113
00:59:04,061 --> 00:59:07,700
thief or that you're anything else.
It's that you don't believe in Christ.

1114
00:59:07,850 --> 00:59:09,440
And so that's what we believe,

1115
00:59:09,441 --> 00:59:12,710
that we are preaching the Gospel
to unbelievers to be saved,

1116
00:59:12,711 --> 00:59:15,170
not a gay people to make them straight.

1117
00:59:15,230 --> 00:59:19,670
Now we do believe that
through sanctification that
we all have to repent from

1118
00:59:19,671 --> 00:59:23,330
our sense. But uh, I think it's
important also to distinguish that,

1119
00:59:23,360 --> 00:59:25,820
that what we're talking about salvation
and sharing the gospel with people.

1120
00:59:25,821 --> 00:59:28,310
It's not necessarily saying,
uh,

1121
00:59:28,870 --> 00:59:31,190
our primary message isn't that
you're gay and that's bad.

1122
00:59:31,270 --> 00:59:31,690
Yeah.

1123
00:59:31,690 --> 00:59:35,610
But do you think people could just stop
being gay if they repented and stuff?

1124
00:59:36,180 --> 00:59:37,920
Well,
I know two different stories.

1125
00:59:38,610 --> 00:59:43,610
There is a really good book by someone
who I totally disagree with in so many

1126
00:59:43,801 --> 00:59:48,270
ways to somebody in so
many ways. But, uh, she,

1127
00:59:48,360 --> 00:59:50,670
she wrote a good book.
Now she probably wouldn't say that.

1128
00:59:50,671 --> 00:59:53,920
Oh God makes people straight, but
it's called gay girl. Good God.

1129
00:59:53,921 --> 00:59:55,110
It's by Jackie Hill Perry.

1130
00:59:55,111 --> 00:59:58,670
And she did live life as a gay person
and then she kind of had an awakening.

1131
00:59:58,680 --> 01:00:02,100
She came to God and she's married and she
has kids. There are stories like that,

1132
01:00:02,101 --> 01:00:04,140
but I also know stories of people.
Um,

1133
01:00:04,290 --> 01:00:08,130
there is another amazing story and I
don't want to say the title because, um,

1134
01:00:08,640 --> 01:00:12,500
yeah, I don't want to say the title, but
there is another incredible story of,

1135
01:00:12,501 --> 01:00:16,590
of someone who, uh, became a Christian.
He lived life as a gay person.

1136
01:00:16,591 --> 01:00:18,960
He actually was in prison,
um,

1137
01:00:18,990 --> 01:00:23,990
and he lived life as a gay person and
he became a Christian and he lives,

1138
01:00:24,270 --> 01:00:27,270
as far as I know,
he loves a celibate lifestyle.

1139
01:00:27,420 --> 01:00:30,240
And so he is not married.

1140
01:00:30,390 --> 01:00:32,700
He is probably never going to be married.

1141
01:00:32,701 --> 01:00:34,650
He might not ever be attracted to women,

1142
01:00:34,651 --> 01:00:39,210
but because he is a Christian and Jesus
has called us to deny ourselves whatever

1143
01:00:39,211 --> 01:00:43,680
our desires are that are simple, uh, he
lived a celibate lifestyle. And so I think

1144
01:00:44,030 --> 01:00:47,880
just strikes me as deeply sad. Like I can
get it. Yeah. You know, like really like,

1145
01:00:47,881 --> 01:00:49,350
you know,
I'm pretty tolerant about this stuff.

1146
01:00:49,370 --> 01:00:54,210
Obviously that one just strikes
me as he, he is gay. He,

1147
01:00:54,211 --> 01:00:58,740
there is this religious
piece of him in there that,

1148
01:00:58,741 --> 01:01:02,490
so the answer is then live alone and
don't have kids and don't have a family.

1149
01:01:02,580 --> 01:01:02,941
Yeah.

1150
01:01:02,941 --> 01:01:07,800
But that is where you start completing
sexuality with identity and romantic

1151
01:01:07,801 --> 01:01:09,810
relationships with the
ultimate fulfillment.

1152
01:01:09,811 --> 01:01:13,620
And that's not what the Christian beliefs
actually Paul says for every one is

1153
01:01:13,621 --> 01:01:16,140
better to be single than
to be married. Um, he says,

1154
01:01:16,141 --> 01:01:17,520
I wish you were all like I was.

1155
01:01:17,521 --> 01:01:20,700
So you can be fully dedicated to the Lord
and we believe that if you're straight

1156
01:01:20,760 --> 01:01:23,490
or straight or you're same sex attracted,

1157
01:01:23,670 --> 01:01:27,990
then the gift of celibacy is truly a
gift that you can dedicate all of your

1158
01:01:27,991 --> 01:01:32,940
passions to God. Um, so we
don't see celibacy as this sad,

1159
01:01:32,970 --> 01:01:36,720
awful, lonely thing. We believe that
in Christ you have full fulfillment,

1160
01:01:36,930 --> 01:01:40,500
full satisfaction, whether
you are attracted to the
opposite sex or the same sex.

1161
01:01:40,501 --> 01:01:44,160
And so I think he would tell you great
person to have on, I'll tell you his name,

1162
01:01:44,430 --> 01:01:45,320
but,
uh,

1163
01:01:45,360 --> 01:01:48,900
I would think he would tell you that he
finds full satisfaction and full of joy

1164
01:01:49,080 --> 01:01:51,480
in his relationship with Christ.
Now that does not mean it's easy.

1165
01:01:51,540 --> 01:01:51,961
Right?
Well,

1166
01:01:51,961 --> 01:01:54,900
I was gonna say he would also sort of
have to say that to rationalize his

1167
01:01:54,901 --> 01:01:56,280
existence, right? Like,

1168
01:01:56,860 --> 01:01:59,540
May, I don't know, I'd be
happy to have the conversation.

1169
01:01:59,541 --> 01:02:00,860
I'm not sure that he would,

1170
01:02:01,730 --> 01:02:06,110
I don't think he would have chosen
because he was living in an actively gay

1171
01:02:06,111 --> 01:02:10,280
lifestyle. His name's Christopher.
You won. And I think he's incredible.

1172
01:02:10,430 --> 01:02:15,170
I don't think he would have chosen
to be a Christian or I don't think he

1173
01:02:15,171 --> 01:02:19,800
would've become a Christian. Um, if he
didn't think that was something to it,

1174
01:02:19,830 --> 01:02:21,570
if he didn't think that it was worth it.
I mean,

1175
01:02:21,571 --> 01:02:24,990
he's seeing the two alternatives
and he chose one direction.

1176
01:02:24,991 --> 01:02:28,590
So he obviously thinks that one is
more satisfying than the other. I mean,

1177
01:02:28,770 --> 01:02:32,760
he got nothing out of, at least
tangibly in this life saying, okay,

1178
01:02:32,761 --> 01:02:37,410
I'm going to give that up and become a
Christian. Yeah. So it makes you wonder,

1179
01:02:37,411 --> 01:02:40,080
it does make you wonder. It should
make you wonder about Christianity.

1180
01:02:40,290 --> 01:02:44,310
What is it about Jesus that would make
someone give up what they thought their

1181
01:02:44,311 --> 01:02:47,280
identity was, where the world
says, well, that's where love is,

1182
01:02:47,281 --> 01:02:49,680
is just being yourself and
loving who you want to love.
