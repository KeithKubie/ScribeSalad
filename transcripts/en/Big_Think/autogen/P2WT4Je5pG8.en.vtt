then it's very difficult to stop that

00:07:41.909 --> 00:07:41.919
then it's very difficult to stop that
 

00:07:41.919 --> 00:07:46.360
then it's very difficult to stop that
but if that is diluted and I always like

00:07:46.360 --> 00:07:46.370
but if that is diluted and I always like
 

00:07:46.370 --> 00:07:49.420
but if that is diluted and I always like
to see the couples have full that there

strong enough to say it's madness to
 

00:07:53.870 --> 00:07:56.920
strong enough to say it's madness to
commit to kill and to be killed because

00:07:56.920 --> 00:07:56.930
commit to kill and to be killed because
 

00:07:56.930 --> 00:07:58.629
commit to kill and to be killed because
of this belief in the hereafter and make

then things could look better but on the
 

00:08:02.899 --> 00:08:04.570
then things could look better but on the
very short time it looks like things

00:08:04.570 --> 00:08:04.580
very short time it looks like things
 

00:08:04.580 --> 00:08:09.489
very short time it looks like things
will look bad I think the major

00:08:09.489 --> 00:08:09.499
will look bad I think the major
 

00:08:09.499 --> 00:08:11.969
will look bad I think the major
misperception in the Western world on

and its basic tenets is something that's
 

00:08:25.180 --> 00:08:28.779
and its basic tenets is something that's
underestimated in the West and I think

00:08:28.779 --> 00:08:28.789
underestimated in the West and I think
 

00:08:28.789 --> 00:08:33.069
underestimated in the West and I think
that Western leaders political

00:08:33.069 --> 00:08:33.079

the Islamic faith needs to go through a
 

00:08:43.669 --> 00:08:44.960
the Islamic faith needs to go through a
process of

process of
 

00:08:44.970 --> 00:08:47.420
process of
information and enlightenment and that

00:08:47.420 --> 00:08:47.430
information and enlightenment and that
 

00:08:47.430 --> 00:08:51.069
information and enlightenment and that
it's going to come at a very high price

00:08:51.069 --> 00:08:51.079
it's going to come at a very high price
 

00:08:51.079 --> 00:08:53.480
it's going to come at a very high price
the better the sooner they do that to

00:08:53.480 --> 00:08:53.490
the better the sooner they do that to
 

00:08:53.490 --> 00:08:55.910
the better the sooner they do that to
the better as long as these leaders go

should make a distinction between Islam

00:09:06.740 --> 00:09:06.750

those are mistakes that were made but
 

00:12:57.300 --> 00:12:58.910
those are mistakes that were made but
again i'll come back to the distinction

00:12:58.910 --> 00:12:58.920
again i'll come back to the distinction
 

00:12:58.920 --> 00:13:00.439
