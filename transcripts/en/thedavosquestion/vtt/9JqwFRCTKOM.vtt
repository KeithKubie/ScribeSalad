00:00:01.310 --> 00:00:05.629
&gt;&gt;I'm David Miliband, the Secretary of State
for Foreign Affairs of the

00:00:05.629 --> 00:00:09.200
UK.
I want to answer a question about how important

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:13.279
is education to
international development and actually to

00:00:13.279 --> 00:00:15.650
building security and
stability around the world.

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:18.390
It surprising, perhaps, for a foreign ministry
that we think that

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:23.529
education is actually at the heart of many
of the security and

00:00:23.529 --> 00:00:28.159
development challenges that the world faces.
Education, especially of women -- I've come

00:00:28.159 --> 00:00:31.659
today from the London
Conference on Afghanistan yesterday, and a

00:00:31.659 --> 00:00:36.440
strong feature of that was
the importance of education as a central offer

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:40.870
to the Afghan people.
Security to deliver education, especially

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:43.440
for girls, is an important
part of the political equation that needs

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:47.460
to be developed in its
neighbor Afghanistan, a country now of 170

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:51.940
million -- its neighbor of
Pakistan, a country of 170 million people.

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:58.420
In light of this, the UK is sponsoring a education
task force with the

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:03.190
Pakistani authorities.
Because with 22,000 madrassas around the country

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:07.560
competing with
Pakistan's state education system, it's absolutely

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:10.450
essential that
education is at the heart of any vision for

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:15.049
the future of Pakistan.
So one of my first jobs in government was

00:01:15.049 --> 00:01:20.299
this to the schools.
It's one of the most inspiring and empowering

00:01:20.299 --> 00:01:23.200
parts of the political
agenda.

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:28.922
The developed goals insist that universal
primary education should be a

00:01:28.922 --> 00:01:33.149
right for all children around the world.
It's a right that sadly lacking and I think

00:01:33.149 --> 00:01:36.560
that the more we put
education at the hearts of our future, the

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:38.579
safer we'll be.
Thanks very much.
