00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:05.400
 If you focus solely on your career, you can end it. 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:09.300
 And I would say that a minority of men prefer 

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:16.229
 that strategy, work is all they do, 70 or 80 hours a week. They totally go for their career. 

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:22.260
 They bet everything on the small chance to excel in a limited domain. 

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:26.760
 But that is hard for them. They have no life and it is difficult for them to have a family. 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:32.279
 They do not know how to enjoy their free time, they develop very unilaterally. Maybe that is 

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:34.590
 One-sidedness is the price that you have to pay 

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:41.610
 to excel. Because if you want to be a brilliant mathematician, for example 

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:44.430
 or a scientist, then you are 

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:49.110
 always at work in your laboratory, 70 to 80 hours a week. 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:51.360
 You are intelligent, committed and one-sided. 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:56.069
 And that's how you beat your competitors, that's the only way. 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:01.980
 But the problem is that you have no life. If you really love science, and if you like that 

00:01:02.559 --> 00:01:09.929
 If you are focused, then first of all you are rare, and secondly: it will cost you, but just what you want. 

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:19.049
 But it is risky to do, you give up a lot for it. 

00:01:19.689 --> 00:01:25.739
 It is not a healthy life, because then you have to divide your attention more 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:31.170
 so that you can have a family and activities other than work that are meaningful and meaningful. 

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:33.390
 You have a circle of friends. 

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:40.470
 These three, four things alone are enough to keep you on track. 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:43.409
 If there is a collapse, 

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:45.280
 then you have not lost everything. 

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:52.470
 The price you pay for this is that the more you want to keep these things in balance, the less likely you are 

00:01:52.899 --> 00:01:59.399
 will excel in one of them, but if you consider your life as a whole 

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:04.829
 then this could be a winning strategy. Carl Jung said something that really appeals to me. 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:13.289
 He thought that men were striving for perfection, and women for "wholeness," in which they differ. 

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:20.129
 There is something else at the top of their value hierarchy. 

00:02:20.129 --> 00:02:20.980
 Perfection would be 

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:28.289
 to bet on one thing and strive for radical success, not that all men do, we are now talking about the extremes. 

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:34.889
 The "wholeness" idea is something else. 

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:38.040
 Or you want one thing in your life that is 150%, 

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:42.209
 or you want five that are each 80%. 

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:45.220
 Well, 

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:50.010
 there is much more wealth in a life in which five aspects are 80% each 

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:53.159
 but none achieves the 150%. 

00:02:53.710 --> 00:03:00.119
 I really believe that because I have seen men and women go through their careers for a long time, 

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:01.840
 and what i have seen, 

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:03.840
 although there are several reasons for this, 

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:10.680
 but something I have seen is that women are leaving their one-sided careers after their 30th birthday. 

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:17.429
 They don't want that anymore. They no longer feel like investing those 80 hours that would be needed 

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:19.770
 to be at the forefront of their field. 

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:25.079
 The reason they do that is that they decide it's not worth it, and no wonder. 

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:32.099
 You have to ask yourself how it could be worth it. If you want to be an excellent scientist 

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:37.409
 That is fine in itself to want and to do, if you really really want it. Because then you have to do that too. 

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:41.490
 Because you have to compete with other people who are smart 

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:42.090
 and work hard. 

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:47.700
 If you want to get to the top, you have to be the smartest and work the hardest, and that means hard work 

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:53.489
 make long days. You must of course be diligent, but ultimately 

00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:59.309
 It is also a matter of addition if I am smart and I work hard for 70 hours a week 

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:05.130
 and you for 30 hours, I will be so far ahead of you within two years that you will never catch up with me again. 

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:07.480
 So. 

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:12.329
 And I think that part of the reason why women are more oriented 

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:14.330
 or actually I think there are two reasons. 

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:17.730
 Firstly: because of a higher socio-economic status, women are not considered more attractive as potential partners, 

00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:22.049
 and men do. Secondly, women have less time available. 

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:26.940
 Because guys can say: well, I will have children later, and they can keep going until they are 80. 

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:29.869
 While that is for women: absolutely not, you have to 

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:33.920
 have arranged your affairs when you are 40, actually before, 35. 

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:41.659
 But certainly before you turn 40, because otherwise you will miss the boat and that is terrible, the most unfortunate people out there ... 

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:44.450
 No, 

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:45.660
 No. 

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:50.179
 A common way to extreme unhappiness is to want children and not to have them. 

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:51.750
 I don't recommend it to anyone. 

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:58.070
 You know that among people in their thirties, one in every three couples has fertility problems. That means 

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:02.090
 that you are not pregnant after a year of trying. One in three. 

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:08.000
 So you better think about that, because people become very unhappy if they want children and it doesn't work. 

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:11.690
 Then you will be in the medical mill for ten years.
