00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:04.600
Sometimes, it just can't wait till you get
home! But with the questionable sanitary state

00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:09.500
of public bathrooms, one has to wonder - should
you hover above or cover the seat with toilet paper? 

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:12.630
Are you really at risk of contamination?

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:16.770
It may be surprising, but in a typical home,
your cutting board has around 200 times more

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:21.510
fecal matter on it than the average toilet
seat. Even worse is the dish sponge, which

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:26.630
has around 200,000 times more bacteria. And
while we've all seen our fair share of dirty

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:31.980
public toilets, the truth is, if it passes
the site test and seems okay, it's probably

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:34.500
cleaner than most other objects in a bathroom.

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:38.980
Regardless, your skin is designed as an excellent
barrier to microorganisms. Even though some

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:43.260
bacteria such as E. Coli can survive on a
toilet seat indefinitely, if you don't have

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:47.420
an open sore near the it, or there isn't something
foreign or sharp on the seat, the bacteria

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:49.710
isn't likely to get inside your body.

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:53.940
And while placing a layer of clean paper on
the seat may reduce your contact with germs,

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:57.960
it's worth considering a few things. First,
the species of bacteria typically found on

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:02.230
toilet seats are common skin microbes that
most people already carry, meaning they pose

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:06.860
little threat unless you are immunocompromised.
And secondly, chances are, microorganisms

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:11.500
are already over everything in the bathroom.
Seriously. Simply flushing a toilet creates

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:16.680
aerosolized bacteria meaning that that toilet
paper itself is likely contaminated.

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:20.689
The risk of infection comes most frequently
from improper hand washing, followed by touching

00:01:20.689 --> 00:01:24.780
your mouth, eyes, or other bodily openings.
If you're that worried about germs and

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:28.909
insist on wasting toilet paper for your toosh,
you should probably be in a biohazard suit,

00:01:28.909 --> 00:01:31.320
because either way, you're being exposed.

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:34.939
On the other hand, hovering over the toilet
is a perfect alternative if you're grossed

00:01:34.939 --> 00:01:39.439
out, and gets a little workout in there as
well. Otherwise, sit with confidence, wash

00:01:39.439 --> 00:01:43.270
your hands, and when you're done, waltz over
to that door and touch the handle that everybody

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:45.820
who didn't wash their hands touched too :)

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:51.100
