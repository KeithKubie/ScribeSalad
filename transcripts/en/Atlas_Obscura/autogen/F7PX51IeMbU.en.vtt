think an event like this happens roughly

hard to say it there is a weird theory
that it is a kind of a gas vent that was

to the vent and then it was struck by
 

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:57.680
to the vent and then it was struck by
lightning and it was like a wick down to

00:03:57.680 --> 00:03:57.690
lightning and it was like a wick down to
 

00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:01.100
