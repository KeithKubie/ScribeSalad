00:00:02.290 --> 00:00:05.440
Back then, it was you traveled
when you performed-- you played

00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:06.946
in the direction you moved.

00:00:06.946 --> 00:00:08.320
Now we try to put
our instruments

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:10.610
towards the audience
at all times.

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:12.820
Back then, it was very
more militaristic.

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:15.310
There was a formality
to the movement, which

00:00:15.310 --> 00:00:17.800
was also very cool and very
hip and it's still done.

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:19.480
It's what they call
the chair step.

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:22.020
They practice that by
stepping as high as a chair.

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:24.490
And so it doesn't translate
to playing an instrument very

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:25.480
well, because you're
bumping around,

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:27.610
but if you have enough
numbers it kind of works out

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:28.901
by the time the sound gets out.

00:00:28.901 --> 00:00:32.350
So we move more dance like now.

00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:36.460
The uniforms also had a
militaristic kind of nature

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:37.210
to them.

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:39.760
Our uniforms today
still have that line--

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:43.840
that very rigid kind of V line--
that strong, strong shoulders.

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:47.140
But it's definitely
more angles and lines

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:51.330
and artistic visible
visual things.

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:53.830
So the goal is still the same--
to be the best marching band

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:58.120
in the country and do innovative
things, creative things,

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:00.490
high value entertainment
things for the crowd.

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:03.550
One of the things that I think
helped me coming from Disney

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:06.430
is appreciating the value
of a quality performance,

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:09.311
but also creating an
experience for people

00:01:09.311 --> 00:01:10.310
that come to the campus.

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:12.250
We want them to have
a game day experience.

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:14.400
