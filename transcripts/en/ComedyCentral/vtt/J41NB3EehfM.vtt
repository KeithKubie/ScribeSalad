00:00:00.867 --> 00:00:03.603
(electronic bell chiming)

00:00:05.905 --> 00:00:07.941
- Happy Hanukkah!

00:00:07.941 --> 00:00:09.709
- Happy Chanukkah!

00:00:09.709 --> 00:00:10.944
- Oh, you say it with a C?

00:00:10.944 --> 00:00:12.245
- Oh, BB I add the C.

00:00:12.245 --> 00:00:13.847
C is for (beeps).

00:00:13.847 --> 00:00:15.482
- Wow.

00:00:15.482 --> 00:00:17.884
Okay, you open yours first.

00:00:17.884 --> 00:00:19.219
- No, c'mon you
open yours first.

00:00:19.219 --> 00:00:20.487
- No, you go first.

00:00:20.487 --> 00:00:21.688
- No, you go first.

00:00:21.688 --> 00:00:23.156
- Dude, please open
your gift first.

00:00:23.156 --> 00:00:25.525
- Okay, I can't say
no to that face.

00:00:25.525 --> 00:00:26.459
Okay.

00:00:26.459 --> 00:00:29.129
Five, four, three, two, one.

00:00:29.129 --> 00:00:30.397
- [Abbi] Hanukkah day.

00:00:30.397 --> 00:00:31.331
(gasps)

00:00:31.331 --> 00:00:34.134
- Oh my god, a slow cooker!

00:00:34.134 --> 00:00:35.502
Are you serious?!

00:00:35.502 --> 00:00:37.404
This is high, high quality.

00:00:37.404 --> 00:00:38.371
- You like it?

00:00:38.371 --> 00:00:39.072
- I don't like it, bitch.

00:00:39.072 --> 00:00:39.939
I love it!

00:00:39.939 --> 00:00:41.174
- Yes!

00:00:41.174 --> 00:00:43.243 align:start size:88% position:13%
- I'm gonna marinate
meat for hours and hours

00:00:43.243 --> 00:00:46.079 align:start size:84% position:16%
and hours and hours
all the live long day.

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:48.581 align:start size:84% position:16%
I really appreciate
it, thank you so much.

00:00:48.581 --> 00:00:49.783
Okay, now it's your turn.

00:00:49.783 --> 00:00:51.951
- Here we go.

00:00:51.951 --> 00:00:53.453
- You are going to love it.

00:00:58.091 --> 00:00:59.025
Do you love it?!

00:01:00.026 --> 00:01:04.697
- Yes, yes, I do.

00:01:04.697 --> 00:01:07.867
I mean, I love it.

00:01:07.867 --> 00:01:09.736 align:start size:84% position:16%
- I was just like what
do you get the girl

00:01:09.736 --> 00:01:11.671
who already has everything,

00:01:11.671 --> 00:01:13.039 align:start size:84% position:16%
and this just
popped into my head.

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.873
- This did?

00:01:13.873 --> 00:01:14.808
- Mm-hm.

00:01:14.808 --> 00:01:16.009
It doesn't come with batteries,

00:01:16.009 --> 00:01:16.810
so I wrapped some in
tobacco leaves for you.

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:17.644
They're also in there.

00:01:17.644 --> 00:01:18.878
There they are.

00:01:18.878 --> 00:01:20.313
And there's a sample of
water-based cleanser.

00:01:20.313 --> 00:01:21.781
Do not wash it with soap,

00:01:21.781 --> 00:01:24.217
it will deteriorate
and start to peel.

00:01:24.217 --> 00:01:27.020 align:start size:88% position:13%
- I wouldn't have
thought to like wash it.

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:28.421
- Huh.

00:01:28.421 --> 00:01:29.789 align:start size:81% position:19%
- I will follow
those instructions

00:01:29.789 --> 00:01:31.624
to take good care of this.

00:01:33.293 --> 00:01:34.427
Oh my god, dude,
I'm running late.

00:01:34.427 --> 00:01:35.361
I gotta go.

00:01:35.361 --> 00:01:36.096
- [Ilana] Okay, love you, BB.

00:01:36.096 --> 00:01:36.930
- Love you.

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:37.764
- Happy Chanukkah.

00:01:37.764 --> 00:01:38.598
- You too.

00:01:38.598 --> 00:01:39.432
Thanks for my thing.

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:51.177
Ew!

00:01:51.177 --> 00:01:54.747
