00:00:00.940 --> 00:00:03.940
- [Instructor] An object
is moving along a line.

00:00:03.940 --> 00:00:08.940
The following graph gives the
object's velocity over time.

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:11.320
For each point on the graph,

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:15.150
is the object moving forward,
backward, or neither?

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:18.010
So pause this video and see
if you can figure that out.

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:19.610
All right, now let's do this together.

00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:21.590
And so we can see these different points

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:24.150
on this velocity-versus-time graph.

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:26.800
And the important thing to realize is

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:30.280
is if the velocity is
positive, we're moving forward.

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:33.740
If the velocity is negative,
we're moving backward.

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:37.120
And if the velocity is
zero, we're not moving

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:39.550
either forward nor backwards,

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:41.750
or neither forward nor backwards.

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:43.620
So right over here we see

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:45.270
that our velocity is positive.

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:47.400
It's a positive two meters per second.

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:51.450
So that means that we are moving forward.

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:54.220
Now, over here our velocity
is zero meters per second.

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:56.123
So this is neither.

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:58.830
Now, over here our velocity

00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:00.940
is negative four meters per second.

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:01.860
So one way to think about it

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:04.900
is we're moving four
meters per second backward.

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:06.563
So I'll write backward.

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:10.200
Now, this is interesting, this last point.

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:11.190
'Cause you might be tempted to say

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:12.590
all right, I'm oscillating.

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:13.640
I'm going up.

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:15.080
Then I'm going down.

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:16.330
Then I'm going back up.

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:17.750
Maybe I'm moving forward here.

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:20.170
But remember, what we're
thinking about here,

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:21.680
this isn't position versus time.

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:23.470
This is velocity versus time.

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:26.350
So if our velocity is negative,
we're moving backwards.

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:30.760
And here our velocity is still negative.

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:33.090
It's becoming less negative,
but it's still negative.

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:35.790
So we are still moving,

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:37.980
we are still moving backward.

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:41.790
If we were at this point right
over here or at this point,

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:43.650
then we would be moving forward

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:45.363
if our velocity were positive.
