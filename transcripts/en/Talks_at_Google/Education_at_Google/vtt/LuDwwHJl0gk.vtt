00:00:01.412 --> 00:00:02.870
MAGGIE JOHNSON:
The way that Google

00:00:02.870 --> 00:00:06.410
started was an academic venture.

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:08.729
JEFF DEAN: How do you
find interesting problems

00:00:08.729 --> 00:00:09.270
in the world?

00:00:09.270 --> 00:00:11.680
ALFRED SPECTOR: Google
depends on academia.

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:14.070
So many of the good ideas
that we've brought forward

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:15.530
to the world come from academe.

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:18.780
JEFF DEAN: One of the real
reasons to engage with academia

00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:20.551
is to get a really
fresh perspective.

00:00:20.551 --> 00:00:22.050
MAGGIE JOHNSON: We
empower academics

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:23.091
to work on real problems.

00:00:23.091 --> 00:00:26.650
And in the other direction,
academics bring ideas.

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:29.940
And new approaches then
are put into practice

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:33.084
much more quickly than in
an academic environment.

00:00:33.084 --> 00:00:34.500
JEFF DEAN: Oh,
that's interesting,

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.514
that's interesting,
and that's interesting.

00:00:36.514 --> 00:00:38.180
All of a sudden,
you've knitted together

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:40.514
something that is really,
really, tremendously powerful.

00:00:40.514 --> 00:00:42.930
MAGGIE JOHNSON: We need their
help, because of the problem

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:44.375
we're trying to
solve internally.

00:00:44.375 --> 00:00:47.140
ALFRED SPECTOR: Academia can
look far out into the future

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:50.250
and can take greater risks and
look for really interesting

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.190
solutions that industry
sometimes cannot.

00:01:03.854 --> 00:01:05.720
RANDY SARGENT: My
name is Randy Sargent.

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:08.650
And I am at Carnegie
Mellon University,

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:13.580
where I work on making
large sets of time series

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:16.445
imagery and data explorable
and understandable.

00:01:16.445 --> 00:01:18.070
REBECCA MOORE: My
name's Rebecca Moore.

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:19.860
I'm on the Google
Earth and Maps Team.

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:21.620
I'm an engineering
manager there.

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:24.590
I lead the development of
Google Earth Engine, which

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:26.730
is our high
performance computing

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:30.760
platform for environmental
data analysis.

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:32.790
I first met Randy in 2005.

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:36.040
I had just joined the Google
Earth Team as the tech lead

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:37.300
for the Google Earth Layers.

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:40.690
There was an innovative
idea that Brian McClendon

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:47.500
had come up with to overlay
thousands of aerial images

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:51.450
that had been taken by a
National Geographic Explorer

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:54.490
over Africa that were
so high resolution.

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:56.730
They were I think,
one inch per pixel.

00:01:56.730 --> 00:02:00.130
If we could succeed in
putting those in Google Earth,

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:03.060
you would be able to
zoom from outer space

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:05.560
to see the eyelashes on a camel.

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:09.104
Randy Sargent was the genius
who figured out how to do that.

00:02:09.104 --> 00:02:10.520
So that's where I
first met Randy.

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:12.060
RANDY SARGENT: That
was a fun time.

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:14.800
I was working at
NASA Ames Research

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:17.120
Center with a team of
people at that time.

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:20.980
And we worked with you,
not only on that, but also

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:24.310
on other things, taking
National Geographic stories

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:26.330
and putting them
in Google Earth.

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:28.080
REBECCA MOORE: So from
the very beginning,

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:31.510
going back almost 10 years, it
was all about innovative use

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:34.710
of imagery and making that
accessible to billions

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:36.979
of people who use Google
Earth and Google Maps.

00:02:36.979 --> 00:02:39.270
RANDY SARGENT: We were starting
to work with scientists

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:42.860
who wanted to use time
series zoomable images.

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:46.110
So building videos, if you will,
where instead of every frame

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:49.580
being 2 million pixels,
like 1080p video,

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:53.770
each frame might be a
billion pixels or even more.

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:55.780
And we had this
technology, and there

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:58.220
were just a few tiny
applications of it.

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:00.890
And we were looking for
something really interesting

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:02.030
to do with it.

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:03.470
And this is about
the time that I

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:07.150
learn about Earth Engine,
Rebecca's newest project.

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:11.150
And we brainstormed about how
could we connect these two.

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:13.380
REBECCA MOORE: We
built Earth Engine

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:18.230
to store an unprecedented
amount of satellite data.

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:20.710
US taxpayers have
funded missions,

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:22.560
like the Landsat
satellite mission, that

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:26.870
have been continuously
collecting millions of images

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:30.010
of the planet, going back
to the Vietnam War era.

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:33.754
The first project of our
Google Earth Engine Team

00:03:33.754 --> 00:03:35.170
was to work with
the US government

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:40.280
to liberate those PetaPixels
of data off those tapes

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:45.070
and bring them online, where
now applying our highly

00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:47.590
parallel analysis and
data mining techniques

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:50.220
that we built a framework
for on Earth Engine,

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:52.700
we could start to produce
derivative products.

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:56.720
We'd been tracking what
Randy's-- his project called

00:03:56.720 --> 00:04:01.300
Time Machine, which is this
zoomable, panable, explorable,

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:03.130
time-varying imagery.

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:05.350
And he had done one
interesting thing

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:07.390
that related to a
certain satellite

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:10.760
imagery data set, called MODIS.

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:12.420
And we saw that, and
we thought, well,

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:16.360
what if we could connect
his time machine methodology

00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:22.050
for this HTML5 video capability
to the PetaPixels of data

00:04:22.050 --> 00:04:24.120
that we now had in Earth Engine.

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:25.790
RANDY SARGENT: Before
coming to Google,

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:28.130
the largest video
we had ever produced

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:30.680
was maybe a billion
pixels per frame.

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:32.980
And scaling by three
orders of magnitude

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:35.370
to trillions of pixels
per frame to capture

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:38.050
all of the historical
Landsat, it really

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:42.190
required new ways of thinking
about architecting the software

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:45.540
and interfacing to the large
infrastructure here at Google.

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:47.290
REBECCA MOORE: What
we did with Randy

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:53.330
is build the world's first
interactive, panable, zoomable

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:57.050
animation of the Earth,
going back three decades.

00:04:57.050 --> 00:04:59.010
The Earth is
changing dramatically

00:04:59.010 --> 00:05:02.150
over these decades in ways
that are observable from space.

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:05.400
You can see urban development,
unbelievable urban development,

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:07.350
not only in what we call
the developing world,

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:09.040
but even in the US.

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:12.120
Las Vegas was the fastest
growing city over that period.

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:14.490
And you can watch
in this animation

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:16.520
as Las Vegas is growing.

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:18.494
And nearby, Lake
Mead is shrinking.

00:05:18.494 --> 00:05:20.410
RANDY SARGENT: Watching
the millions of people

00:05:20.410 --> 00:05:23.610
come to the site, watching
the ways it's being used,

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:24.860
I could not be happier.

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:27.170
REBECCA MOORE: In the first
few days of the release,

00:05:27.170 --> 00:05:30.560
we had more than three million
people around the world

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:31.850
come and view it.

00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:35.400
Time Magazine published
a huge feature online

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:37.540
and in print on what
are the phenomena

00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:39.900
that you could see
really and grasp

00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:42.615
for the first time in
this time lapse Earth.

00:05:42.615 --> 00:05:45.440
RANDY SARGENT: Going back
into the history of Landsat

00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:49.530
and looking at how the
Earth looked from space,

00:05:49.530 --> 00:05:51.170
it's just the tip
of the iceberg.

00:05:51.170 --> 00:05:54.770
If you look at what Earth
Engine was truly built to do,

00:05:54.770 --> 00:05:57.360
it was built to also
provide analysis

00:05:57.360 --> 00:06:00.270
on top of this
historical imagery.

00:06:00.270 --> 00:06:03.080
What can we quantify what's
happening to the planet?

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:05.380
What are the trends?

00:06:05.380 --> 00:06:07.870
The sort of information
that comes from that,

00:06:07.870 --> 00:06:11.500
we need to also make
that interesting, useful,

00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:15.460
explorable, usable by people
in the policy community,

00:06:15.460 --> 00:06:17.720
usable by the general public.

00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:21.710
We need to figure
out what's happening

00:06:21.710 --> 00:06:22.730
to the Earth over time.

00:06:22.730 --> 00:06:24.955
But we also need to be able
to communicate and understand

00:06:24.955 --> 00:06:25.454
that.

00:06:25.454 --> 00:06:27.790
REBECCA MOORE: This first
timelapse was a imagery,

00:06:27.790 --> 00:06:31.470
but now we could do timelapses
of derived information.

00:06:31.470 --> 00:06:34.190
In other words, we're turning
those pixels into knowledge.

00:06:34.190 --> 00:06:37.010
And now, let's show
the timelapses of that.

00:06:37.010 --> 00:06:40.050
RANDY SARGENT: Being
able to take ideas

00:06:40.050 --> 00:06:43.720
and then scale them to
real and pressing problems,

00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:46.820
scale them not only
to huge sets of data,

00:06:46.820 --> 00:06:50.510
like the entire planet in this
case, but then take the results

00:06:50.510 --> 00:06:55.440
and bring those out to everyone
on the planet, something

00:06:55.440 --> 00:06:58.485
that we could not do
at Carnegie Mellon.

00:06:58.485 --> 00:07:01.140
REBECCA MOORE: Take something,
like the Landsat satellite

00:07:01.140 --> 00:07:04.980
catalog, it's a treasure
trove of data that has never

00:07:04.980 --> 00:07:08.500
fired a single neuron
in a single human brain.

00:07:08.500 --> 00:07:10.530
And this is sad.

00:07:10.530 --> 00:07:14.530
Well now, these projects,
like this timelapse Earth,

00:07:14.530 --> 00:07:18.610
are causing lots of neurons to
fire in lots of human brains.

00:07:18.610 --> 00:07:20.910
RANDY SARGENT: If you're
interested to see more

00:07:20.910 --> 00:07:24.270
about the timelapse Earth
that we worked on together,

00:07:24.270 --> 00:07:26.750
please stay tuned for my talk.
