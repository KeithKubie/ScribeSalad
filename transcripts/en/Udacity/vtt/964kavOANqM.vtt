00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:02.190
So now let's take a look at the code that makes up

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:06.170
the home page for this app. So here's the home page. It

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:08.390
has a couple of buttons, it has the field where you can

00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:12.650
enter your name. You can click the buttons and you get the greeting,

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:15.700
and in this case, the greetings are shown just inside an alert

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:18.830
box. Now one thing I want to emphasize is that you can

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:22.430
have the Endpoint APIs and you can use the APIs Explorer even

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:25.210
if your application doesn't have a front end, if it doesn't have a

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:27.700
webpage or anything. If you're just running complete

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:30.650
back end service, you can use API's explorer to

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:34.330
test your API's, but now, onto the front

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:38.110
end. So let's look at the code for index.html.

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:39.885
So first of all, we include the file

00:00:39.885 --> 00:00:43.760
hello.js, which includes the JavaScript functions that our web

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:45.500
app's going to use in its front end,

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:50.290
and then, and this is really important, we include

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:55.360
this file, apis.google.com/js/client.js.

00:00:55.360 --> 00:01:00.910
This is a file that includes a JavaScript client library. If you don't include

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:02.360
this file, you won't be able to use

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:05.260
end points in your front end. The client libraries

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:07.150
provide the glue that let's your app use

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:09.650
end points. So you will also notice so after

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:12.520
we bring it in when onload successful we

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:15.480
call the init function and this init function actually

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:19.420
defined in hello.js. We'll look at that just a minute.

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:21.760
The rest of this page is not so exciting, we

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:23.760
have a heading, then we have to fill for the

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:27.230
buttons, so this one here is the input_greet_generically and this

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:31.340
one here is input_greet_by_name. We also have the field where

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:33.365
we let the user enter their name, and that's the

00:01:33.365 --> 00:01:37.370
name_field, and that's pretty much all this file has. One

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:41.190
thing to note, though, is the onclick of the button

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:44.530
doesn't have a real value. This is actually a

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:47.190
fake value. So when we load the page the

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:52.500
first time, these buttons. Don't have any on-click action

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.310
set, and the reason for that is when these

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:56.380
actions are loaded, they're going to need to use

00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:00.630
endpoints. They're going to use your endpoint functions, and

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:03.490
your endpoint functions can't be loaded 'til after the

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:06.190
google client library is loaded. So you want to

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:09.150
load the google client library first, and then

00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:12.530
you need to initialize some things, and then you

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:15.430
can set the action field buttons. Okay, let's

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:18.480
take a look at hello.js. So up here these

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:21.590
are just some good resources to read, after

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:24.570
the Google Javascript client library has loaded, then this

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:27.200
init function is going to be called, and really all

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:31.000
these does is it loads your hello world end

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:36.380
points APIs. See here this gapi.client.load? This

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:39.370
is calling functions in the Google JavaScript

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:42.810
Client Library to load your endpoint function.

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:45.130
So when you call gapi.client to load your

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:47.860
endpoint functions, you specify the endpoint functions

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:50.760
to load, specify the version, you specify

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:53.900
a callback to call. After your endpoint

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:56.210
functions have loaded, and then you must specify

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:58.770
the rootpath, which is the path to

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:02.310
your endpoints API, and you can construct that

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:05.430
rootpath like this. Just basically, wherever your

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:10.760
app's running, add /_ah/api. Now if you leave

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:15.630
off the rootpath. The load function will work or it will seem to work but

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:18.240
when you go to call your endpoint APIs

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:21.480
the execution calls won't work and that's because

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:23.680
the Google client library will be looking in the Google

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:27.120
public APIs instead of looking at the endpoint APIs for

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:30.300
your app. So do make sure you specify the root

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:33.990
path. Okay, so after we load the hello world endpoints API,

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:37.050
we're going to call the load call back function. Here's the

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:40.160
load call back, very simple, it just enables the buttons.

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:43.170
It might do other things in other apps, but here

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:47.410
all we do is enable the buttons. The enable buttons function

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:49.940
uses straight up Java script to set the actions on

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:53.270
the buttons. So we get the button that you clicked,

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:56.620
greet generically, and we set the on click action to

00:03:56.620 --> 00:03:59.860
be the greet generically function, and we change the value

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:02.250
of the button, the label of the button so that

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:05.090
the user knows that it's ready for action, and then

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:08.710
similarly, we get the greet by name button and we

00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:11.220
set the action, when it's clicked, to be greet by name,

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:15.320
and again we change the label, and just

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:18.680
a reminder that we enable the buttons here instead

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:22.330
of setting them in index.html because these functions,

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:27.480
greetGenerically and greetByName, won't be active until after the

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:30.130
hello world end point's API's been loaded and

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:32.050
you can't load that till after you've loaded the

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:34.910
JavaScript client library. So you don't want the user

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:37.910
to be clicking on the buttons before everything's ready.

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:42.610
Okay, so more interestingly the greatGenerically function illustrates

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:45.070
how to issue a call to an, to one

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:47.470
of your own endpoint API. So you construct

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:51.380
the request. You need to start with gapi.client. You

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:53.840
specify the endpoints API to call, which in

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:56.800
this case is helloworldendpoints, and then the actual functional

00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:59.250
method, which is sayHello. So you construct the

00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:02.980
request, and then you execute the request, and that's

00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:07.900
all you have to do to issue the call. You also need to specify a callback

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:12.170
to call to process the response when the request is

00:05:12.170 --> 00:05:16.880
executed, and similarly, greetByName. Does the same thing. Only here

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:21.545
we get the name out of the name field. We issue the request,

00:05:21.545 --> 00:05:28.000
gapi.client.helloworldendpoints.sayHello, and here we do pass

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.120
the name to the request, and this is

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:34.920
how you construct parameters to endpoint functions. Specify the

00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:39.030
parameter and then the value, and you can add,

00:05:39.030 --> 00:05:41.580
if we had more, you can add more here.

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:45.915
So, for example you can add a second arg, arg2 and specify the value to be value

00:05:45.915 --> 00:05:49.250
two, and then you execute the request. We're going

00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:52.760
to the same callback when our request is successful.

00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:55.070
Okay so here's the call back that gets

00:05:55.070 --> 00:05:58.530
called when our request is executed successfully and we

00:05:58.530 --> 00:06:01.730
process the response and the response is always

00:06:01.730 --> 00:06:04.260
passed to the call back. In this case all

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:05.960
we do is throw up a dialogue box,

00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:09.200
use the alert function, throw up a dialogue box

00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:11.510
and get the message field out of the

00:06:11.510 --> 00:06:14.220
response, and going back real quick to the Java.

00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:21.810
To the hello class, recall that the hello class has a message field. The

00:06:21.810 --> 00:06:26.720
hello will a point API so we defined so far or return a hello class object, so

00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:31.610
our responses is going to have a message field. So, now you know how to defined

00:06:31.610 --> 00:06:35.670
a point functions in java and how to call them from java script in your UI.
