00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.440
Today, we are making
glue made out of food,

00:00:02.440 --> 00:00:03.834
and putting it
to the test to see

00:00:03.834 --> 00:00:06.900
how well it holds up against
commercially available products.

00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:13.240
[Music]

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:15.300
Guys, everyone knows
about Elmer's Glue, super glue,

00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:17.350
lots of regular glues
that you're going to find

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:18.148
around the house,

00:00:18.148 --> 00:00:18.900
but did you know

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:20.562
that you can actually
make these at home?

00:00:20.562 --> 00:00:21.128
That's right.

00:00:21.128 --> 00:00:22.696
Glue has been around
for a lot longer

00:00:22.696 --> 00:00:24.150
than the Elmer's Glue company,

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:27.000
and we wanted to take a look
at some recipes that we found

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.300
that might have worked
for older types of glue,

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:32.250
and see how they compare to
what we're using from the store.

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:33.463
Now, I think it's safe to say

00:00:33.463 --> 00:00:35.199
that not all glue
is created equally.

00:00:35.199 --> 00:00:38.200
You do not get the same results
with Elmer's glue that you do

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:39.500
with say a super glue.

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:40.600
But there are lots

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:42.937
of variations of recipes
that you can make at home.

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:44.200
So we want to try them out.

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:48.100
Glue has been around
since approximately 70,000 BC,

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:51.540
when cavemen would use
glue made out of tree sap

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:53.900
as a protective coating
for cave paintings.

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:55.500
Around the year 2,000 BC,

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.920
Egyptians started using
a liquid glue as an adhesive

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:00.560
in their wooden artifacts.

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:03.000
In 1932, Elmer's
Glue was introduced,

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.900
and became a staple
of the industry,

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:06.000
and still is today.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.100
Here's the basic idea.

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:09.200
Using common household
ingredients, most

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:10.100
of which are food,

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.500
we're going to make a variety
of different types of glues,

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:15.000
and see how they hold up against
their commercial counterparts.

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:16.960
So for our first glue,

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:19.600
we are going to go with
the most basic of basic recipes.

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:20.600
This is probably one

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:22.800
that used to use
in preschool or kindergarten.

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:24.400
It's just flour paste.

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:25.100
You need that,

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:26.800
and you need water,
and that's it.

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:27.717
So for flour paste,

00:01:27.717 --> 00:01:28.960
if you've never used it,

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:31.500
this stuff is really good
for simple paper crafts,

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.900
or even if you're putting
up posters outside,

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:36.300
and you don't want to use
any sort of toxic glue.

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:37.941
This stuff is wonderful for it.

00:01:37.941 --> 00:01:41.000
Making this glue is the easiest
it could possibly be.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.071
You're just going to mix water
and flour together

00:01:43.071 --> 00:01:45.057
until you have about
a cake batter consistency,

00:01:45.057 --> 00:01:47.000
and then throw it on the stove
until it boils.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.300
Now, we're going to be making
multiple types of glue.

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:50.800
So just to keep them separate,

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:53.100
and keep track of them,
we're also going to add

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:54.800
a little bit of food
coloring to each of them.

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:56.100
This one's going to be green.

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:57.219
Sort of green.

00:01:57.219 --> 00:01:58.450
Yellowish green.

00:01:58.450 --> 00:01:59.900
Maybe I need more food coloring.

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:03.290
Well, it's definitely
sticking to itself.

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:04.800
We made guacamole glue.

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:07.920
It does look like guacamole.

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:10.500
While our first glue recipe
is cooling down off the stove,

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:12.300
we're going to be starting
in our next one.

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:13.800
This recipe calls for water,

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:17.537
corn starch, 2 tablespoons
of corn syrup, and finally,

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:19.700
1 teaspoon white vinegar.

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:22.300
This glue recipe is supposed
to end up quite thick,

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:24.300
almost the consistency
of a glue stick.

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:26.223
In the past, we've done
some stuff with glue sticks

00:02:26.223 --> 00:02:27.300
where we took a lot of them,

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:28.800
and we put them
in a George Foreman grill.

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:29.520
It was a lot of fun.

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:30.615
Those glue sticks were purple,

00:02:30.615 --> 00:02:32.648
and I think we're just going
to carry on with that theme.

00:02:32.648 --> 00:02:33.573
We've got a green glue.

00:02:33.573 --> 00:02:34.700
Now, let's do a purple glue.

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:37.400
Now we put this on the stove,
heat it up, and mix it

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:38.340
until it gets thick.

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:44.000
[Music]

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:46.610
It almost looks exactly
like our melted glue sticks.

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:48.400
It does look very similar.

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:50.700
Okay, making that was
fairly interesting.

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:53.229
I spent maybe four
or five minutes stirring.

00:02:53.229 --> 00:02:54.500
It was on medium heat.

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:55.847
Most of the time
I was stirring it,

00:02:55.847 --> 00:02:56.797
it was really thin.

00:02:56.797 --> 00:02:58.300
It was like the
consistency of milk,

00:02:58.300 --> 00:02:59.600
although, you know purple,

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:00.600
because we added
the purple food coloring.

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:03.600
But it's just thin, thin,
thin, then all of a sudden,

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:04.600
I saw it starting

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:06.500
to sort of blob up
on the end of the spatula,

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:08.080
and I was worried
I'd done it wrong,

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:09.210
but I just kept stirring,

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:11.400
and the whole thing
thickened very quickly.

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:13.635
All right, so we
have got our two types

00:03:13.635 --> 00:03:15.100
of homemade glue here.

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:17.700
This one is just
regular craft paste.

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:19.700
So it doesn't have
the strongest sticking power,

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:21.300
but we're still going
to put it to the test

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:22.397
against Elmer's Glue.

00:03:22.397 --> 00:03:23.227
The other one

00:03:23.227 --> 00:03:26.620
that we've got here is
technically glue stick glue,

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:29.100
and we want to compare that
to glue sticks itself as well.

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:31.000
So what we're going to do
is were actually going

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:31.900
to have a weight test.

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:33.500
Nate has a scale,

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:36.300
and we are going to hang stuff
from the glue itself,

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:37.600
and actually see just

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:39.800
how much weight this stuff
can take before it breaks.

00:03:39.800 --> 00:04:00.060
[Music]

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:00.660
Okay.

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:02.276
Now, I think we need
to let these dry,

00:04:02.276 --> 00:04:04.515
and while we're letting
these dry, we can try

00:04:04.515 --> 00:04:05.699
are other types of glue.

00:04:05.699 --> 00:04:07.149
So the glues we've made so far

00:04:07.149 --> 00:04:10.100
are very water soluble as are
their commercial counterparts.

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:11.452
So the glues were going

00:04:11.452 --> 00:04:13.700
to make now should
technically be waterproof.

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:16.250
We're going to make one
that's a little bit simpler,

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:16.790
and then one

00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:18.978
that should be strong
enough to mend broken glass.

00:04:18.978 --> 00:04:20.845
But we're going to put
those to the test.

00:04:20.845 --> 00:04:23.600
So this first one we're going
to do is going to be glycerin,

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:25.247
water, gelatin, and vinegar.

00:04:25.247 --> 00:04:28.600
So you're going to start with
6 tablespoons of cold water,

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:31.440
and then two packets
of unflavored gelatin.

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:32.580
Now, we're going to put
this on the stove,

00:04:32.583 --> 00:04:33.774
and we're going to heat it up

00:04:33.774 --> 00:04:35.500
until the gelatin
has dissolved completely.

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:38.300
Alright, so we've got
the gelatin all dissolved.

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:39.815
Now, we're going
to take it off the heat,

00:04:39.815 --> 00:04:41.900
and we're going to add two
tablespoons of white vinegar,

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:44.420
and a teaspoon of Glycerin.

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:47.000
And we're also adding just a bit
of yellow food coloring.

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:49.300
So we can keep all
of these separate.

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:50.739
You do want to use
this glue warm,

00:04:50.739 --> 00:04:51.761
but we want to make sure

00:04:51.761 --> 00:04:53.337
that it's cooled
just enough to touch,

00:04:53.337 --> 00:04:54.771
and then we'll be
able to use it.

00:04:54.771 --> 00:04:56.608
So we are going
to make one more glue

00:04:56.608 --> 00:04:58.600
that's supposedly tougher
than the rest.

00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:00.400
Now, this is a waterproof glue.

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:03.120
The other two that we have
our craft glues and paste,

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:04.300
but we're going to try one

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:06.400
that is specific
for holding glass together.

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:07.800
Starting off,

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:10.300
we're taking three tablespoons
of fat-free milk,

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:12.900
and we're going to heat
that up on the stove.

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:15.600
You want this almost to boiling,
but not quite.

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:17.200
While Nate is heating
up the milk,

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:20.200
I'm going to mix 2 tablespoons
of cold water with two packets

00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:21.050
of gelatin again,

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:23.700
get those as dissolved as we can
before we add the milk.

00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:24.500
So perfect.

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:25.820
Yeah, we're starting
to get a simmer,

00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:26.700
so we can take that off,

00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:29.600
and we're going to mix that
directly into our gelatin mix.

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:31.482
So this recipe
is both waterproof

00:05:31.482 --> 00:05:34.300
and supposedly strong enough
to hold together glass.

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:35.700
But it does have milk in it,

00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:38.100
so it will spoil
if you don't use it immediately.

00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:40.200
One way that you
can actually kind of combat

00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:42.620
that is you can add
some peppermint extract.

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:44.160
Keeps it from spoiling.

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:45.713
So I think that means
we need some glass

00:05:45.713 --> 00:05:47.066
that needs to be glued,

00:05:47.066 --> 00:05:50.200
and right now, we've got glass
that doesn't need to be glued.

00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:52.200
So...

00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:53.400
We're going
to break some stuff.

00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:55.100
We're not exactly sure

00:05:55.100 --> 00:05:57.400
how high up we need
to hold these to drop them,

00:05:57.400 --> 00:05:58.600
and have them
break their concrete.

00:05:58.600 --> 00:06:00.600
So we're going to start low,
and work our way up.

00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:03.000
So these are thicker
than your usual glasses,

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:04.800
and they're made
of borosilicate glass,

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:06.569
which is going to be
a little bit harder

00:06:06.569 --> 00:06:09.231
for us to break than soda lime,
but we're going to try it.

00:06:09.231 --> 00:06:11.100
Okay, I'm going to go
up to about a foot.

00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:11.400
Okay.

00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:13.140
3, 2, 1.

00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:15.100
Something broke.

00:06:15.100 --> 00:06:16.158
This one's broken.

00:06:16.158 --> 00:06:17.276
Oh, mines in pieces.

00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:19.100
All right, we get about 1 foot.

00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:21.000
That one sounded

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:22.910
like it exploded
into lots of pieces.

00:06:22.910 --> 00:06:25.400
That one will never be
a glass again.

00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:31.660
[Music]

00:06:31.660 --> 00:06:33.900
All right, which glue do we
want to use on which cup.

00:06:33.900 --> 00:06:36.200
So let's go from what we
think will be the strongest

00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:36.809
to the weakest.

00:06:36.809 --> 00:06:39.100
So I'm going to say
super glue for the worst.

00:06:39.100 --> 00:06:41.300
Let's go ahead and take
our glue made specifically

00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:42.500
for glass to this piece,

00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:44.202
and then our one
that's almost intact,

00:06:44.202 --> 00:06:46.320
we'll go ahead and use
our waterproof glue for.

00:06:46.320 --> 00:07:16.020
[Music]

00:07:16.020 --> 00:07:18.400
All of our glue has had
plenty of time to set,

00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:20.900
so now we need to see
how well it's working out.

00:07:21.060 --> 00:07:21.660
I think first,

00:07:21.660 --> 00:07:23.032
we can take a look
at our glass glues,

00:07:23.032 --> 00:07:24.400
compare those, see
what we've got,

00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:27.184
and we've actually done
multiple tests with the glues.

00:07:27.184 --> 00:07:29.395
For instance, I also
glued these two pieces

00:07:29.395 --> 00:07:30.748
of glass to each other,

00:07:30.748 --> 00:07:33.700
and this piece of paper on here
to act as sort of a label

00:07:33.700 --> 00:07:35.900
that you're putting on a glass
jar or something like that.

00:07:35.900 --> 00:07:37.500
There's our breaking
point right there.

00:07:37.500 --> 00:07:39.027
Just removing the tape
on that one,

00:07:39.027 --> 00:07:40.256
it was too much for this.

00:07:40.256 --> 00:07:42.236
And this is the one
that the recipe said

00:07:42.236 --> 00:07:44.036
it was specifically
for glass, right?

00:07:44.036 --> 00:07:44.353
It did.

00:07:44.353 --> 00:07:44.579
Yeah.

00:07:44.579 --> 00:07:45.800
That's what's so confusing.

00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:46.600
Now, this recipe,

00:07:46.600 --> 00:07:48.700
you're supposed to use
at room temperature,

00:07:48.700 --> 00:07:49.722
which is why it's

00:07:49.722 --> 00:07:52.850
so gelatinous to glue glass
to other pieces of glass.

00:07:52.850 --> 00:07:55.017
Put a little bit
of pressure on this that,

00:07:55.017 --> 00:07:55.900
just right off.

00:07:55.900 --> 00:07:58.100
You got those two pieces
all right together.

00:07:58.100 --> 00:07:59.074
The recipe I found

00:07:59.074 --> 00:08:01.510
actually told you to keep
it room temperature.

00:08:01.510 --> 00:08:02.577
That's what all this is.

00:08:02.577 --> 00:08:03.600
That's what fell apart.

00:08:03.600 --> 00:08:04.623
I wasn't having it.

00:08:04.623 --> 00:08:05.700
So I superheated it.

00:08:05.700 --> 00:08:08.006
And this one that's
actually staying together.

00:08:08.006 --> 00:08:10.163
Yeah, that's actually
holding really well.

00:08:10.163 --> 00:08:11.900
I'm going to try
and break it off.

00:08:13.060 --> 00:08:15.100
All right, so one
was able to come apart,

00:08:15.100 --> 00:08:18.100
but so much more
resistant than like,

00:08:18.100 --> 00:08:20.340
that has almost no resistance,

00:08:20.340 --> 00:08:22.937
it just falls right off,
heating it up.

00:08:22.937 --> 00:08:24.890
So when this is
like nice and hot,

00:08:24.890 --> 00:08:25.900
and very liquid,

00:08:25.900 --> 00:08:28.500
it actually does an okay job
of securing the glass together.

00:08:28.500 --> 00:08:29.500
So room temperature,

00:08:29.500 --> 00:08:32.290
this is just two pieces
of glass glued to each other.

00:08:32.290 --> 00:08:33.900
Let's see how well that holds.

00:08:34.620 --> 00:08:35.300
Not really.

00:08:35.369 --> 00:08:36.600
Virtually, none.

00:08:36.600 --> 00:08:37.600
Might be good

00:08:37.600 --> 00:08:39.400
if you're just trying
to like keep a piece

00:08:39.400 --> 00:08:41.800
of glass from sliding off
another piece of glass.

00:08:41.800 --> 00:08:42.697
I'll see this goes.

00:08:42.697 --> 00:08:43.500
Go with this one,

00:08:43.500 --> 00:08:45.150
see how well
that comes to pieces.

00:08:45.150 --> 00:08:47.347
It's already so much stronger
than mine was.

00:08:47.347 --> 00:08:49.800
It does have the advantage
of being all together,

00:08:49.800 --> 00:08:52.070
so it's just every side
is being supported.

00:08:52.070 --> 00:08:53.650
I'm gonna try and break
that apart now.

00:08:53.650 --> 00:08:55.120
See mine just snapped apart.

00:08:55.120 --> 00:08:56.260
[inaudible]

00:08:56.260 --> 00:08:57.500
Okay, so I was able

00:08:57.500 --> 00:08:59.400
to put a little bit
of pressure on that,

00:08:59.400 --> 00:09:02.370
and it's coming apart,
but it's still tacky too.

00:09:02.370 --> 00:09:03.900
Mine is not even tacky anymore.

00:09:03.900 --> 00:09:04.800
Okay, there we go.

00:09:04.800 --> 00:09:06.548
Once you've got one piece off.

00:09:06.548 --> 00:09:08.490
They're all just
gonna fall apart.

00:09:08.490 --> 00:09:11.600
This glue was meant to glue
glass to other pieces of glass.

00:09:11.600 --> 00:09:14.068
This type of glue was simply
meant to be waterproof.

00:09:14.068 --> 00:09:16.248
So I'm curious about
our little paper label.

00:09:16.248 --> 00:09:18.355
We both had labels
attached with our glue.

00:09:18.355 --> 00:09:20.155
Let's see how well
this is attached.

00:09:20.155 --> 00:09:21.800
So this is just
a piece of paper.

00:09:21.800 --> 00:09:23.564
It did come off fairly easily.

00:09:23.564 --> 00:09:25.230
But it also was staying on it.

00:09:25.230 --> 00:09:26.800
Nothing was pulling that off.

00:09:26.800 --> 00:09:28.200
It was sticking pretty nicely.

00:09:28.200 --> 00:09:28.939
Now, this is fun.

00:09:28.939 --> 00:09:31.200
This is actually pulling off
like how I've seen a lot

00:09:31.200 --> 00:09:32.100
of cooking labels.

00:09:32.100 --> 00:09:35.400
This is actually how I've seen
labels peel off before,

00:09:35.400 --> 00:09:36.200
and this is--

00:09:36.200 --> 00:09:37.380
Even leaving some behind.

00:09:37.380 --> 00:09:37.720
Yeah.

00:09:38.730 --> 00:09:40.959
Out of these two glues,
which one would you use?

00:09:40.959 --> 00:09:43.010
I would definitely go
with the yellow one.

00:09:43.010 --> 00:09:44.610
It definitely seems more useful,

00:09:44.610 --> 00:09:46.081
easier to use
by a little bit,

00:09:46.081 --> 00:09:47.400
and a little bit stronger.

00:09:47.400 --> 00:09:49.900
My superglued cup
is just a huge mess,

00:09:49.900 --> 00:09:51.700
still missing big old pieces,

00:09:51.700 --> 00:09:53.500
because it broke
quite a bit.

00:09:53.500 --> 00:09:55.000
I couldn't get
everything back together.

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:56.199
Some bits are still missing.

00:09:56.199 --> 00:09:56.700
I think.

00:09:56.700 --> 00:09:57.600
Wow.

00:09:57.600 --> 00:09:58.440
Okay.

00:09:58.440 --> 00:10:00.100
That actually just
broke the glass again.

00:10:00.100 --> 00:10:01.900
That didn't come
apart at the glue.

00:10:01.900 --> 00:10:03.500
This is where it was glued,

00:10:03.500 --> 00:10:06.400
and here is a new break
that I just put into it

00:10:06.400 --> 00:10:07.600
by pulling it apart.

00:10:07.600 --> 00:10:10.400
Superglue, better or worse
than our homemade glues?

00:10:10.400 --> 00:10:11.550
I have to say better.

00:10:11.550 --> 00:10:13.700
Superglue actually has
ingredients that we

00:10:13.700 --> 00:10:15.749
don't just have lying
around the house usually.

00:10:15.749 --> 00:10:16.699
Can you order them?

00:10:16.699 --> 00:10:16.892
Yes.

00:10:16.892 --> 00:10:18.000
Is it possible to make?

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:19.600
Yes, but for convenience sake,

00:10:19.600 --> 00:10:21.380
I would say reach
for the Superglue.

00:10:21.530 --> 00:10:24.000
We've got non-glass type glue,

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:26.400
and we've built some tests
for that as well.

00:10:26.400 --> 00:10:28.300
I think it's time to see
how they hold up.

00:10:28.300 --> 00:10:30.550
I want to start
with our homemade flour paste,

00:10:30.550 --> 00:10:32.800
and then I want to compare
it to Elmer's Glue.

00:10:34.260 --> 00:10:35.260
Wow.

00:10:35.260 --> 00:10:38.000
[Music]

00:10:38.140 --> 00:10:41.700
Oh, it didn't break the glue,
it broke the paper clip.

00:10:41.700 --> 00:10:43.680
I'm just gonna hang all
of my weight from this.

00:10:43.680 --> 00:10:44.180
You ready?

00:10:45.700 --> 00:10:46.840
Oh!

00:10:46.840 --> 00:10:49.300
See, that time,
it got to four pounds.

00:10:49.300 --> 00:10:50.731
I like our old result better.

00:10:50.731 --> 00:10:52.700
We got over 20,
and I kind of wonder

00:10:52.700 --> 00:10:55.150
if just by pulling it twisted,
just a little bit--

00:10:55.150 --> 00:10:55.677
I think so.

00:10:55.677 --> 00:10:56.200
I think it,

00:10:56.200 --> 00:10:58.900
and it also hit the ground so,
it could have, you know,

00:10:58.900 --> 00:10:59.704
cracked a little bit.

00:10:59.704 --> 00:11:01.200
That's interesting
for a couple reasons.

00:11:01.200 --> 00:11:02.816
When you're pulling
straight apart,

00:11:02.816 --> 00:11:04.079
when we were adding weight,

00:11:04.079 --> 00:11:07.100
or you're pulling straight down,
it held a lot of weight,

00:11:07.100 --> 00:11:09.200
and that actually reminds me
of something similar.

00:11:09.200 --> 00:11:11.600
This is a paper bag
from the grocery store.

00:11:11.600 --> 00:11:14.200
These handles here,
they're glued on.

00:11:14.200 --> 00:11:15.890
It's just paper glued to paper.

00:11:15.890 --> 00:11:17.800
And if you pull
straight up on them,

00:11:17.800 --> 00:11:20.000
you can put quite a bit
of weight in these bags.

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:21.900
In fact, it even
says on the bag,

00:11:21.900 --> 00:11:23.400
pull handles up, not out.

00:11:23.400 --> 00:11:25.505
So pulling straight
up on these bags,

00:11:25.505 --> 00:11:27.800
you can get quite a bit
of weight going.

00:11:27.800 --> 00:11:30.260
But as soon as
you pull sideways,

00:11:31.700 --> 00:11:34.000
they come off so easily.

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:34.600
But we got at least

00:11:34.600 --> 00:11:37.820
25 pounds pulling straight down
with our first glue.

00:11:37.820 --> 00:11:40.500
Let's move on to
our so-called glue stick glue.

00:11:40.500 --> 00:11:44.160
[Music]

00:11:44.160 --> 00:11:45.420
What did we get to?

00:11:45.420 --> 00:11:46.600
I didn't see that time.

00:11:46.600 --> 00:11:47.500
I didn't either.

00:11:47.500 --> 00:11:49.100
Hopefully, Mark caught it.

00:11:50.800 --> 00:11:51.900
When we did our video

00:11:51.900 --> 00:11:54.500
with tons of glue sticks
in the George Foreman grill,

00:11:54.500 --> 00:11:57.383
I have never been super
satisfied with the performance

00:11:57.383 --> 00:11:59.629
of a glue stick
in gluing things together.

00:11:59.629 --> 00:12:02.100
However, now we're going
to see how it does

00:12:02.100 --> 00:12:03.980
in our fish scale test.

00:12:04.180 --> 00:12:08.180
[Music]

00:12:08.180 --> 00:12:09.200
14.

00:12:09.980 --> 00:12:12.136
I think that was at 14 pounds.

00:12:12.136 --> 00:12:16.086
Both of our homemade glues
are almost doubly as strong

00:12:16.086 --> 00:12:17.692
as the glue stick glue.

00:12:17.692 --> 00:12:18.600
Elmer's Glue.

00:12:18.600 --> 00:12:20.587
Now, this is the one we
both thought was going

00:12:20.587 --> 00:12:21.250
to be the best.

00:12:23.820 --> 00:12:26.100
&gt;&gt; Holy cow.
&gt;&gt; That's 40 ...

00:12:27.220 --> 00:12:27.840
50...

00:12:27.840 --> 00:12:29.300
Oh, we maxed out this scale.

00:12:30.300 --> 00:12:31.700
We have a solution to this.

00:12:31.700 --> 00:12:35.660
[Music]

00:12:35.760 --> 00:12:37.300
Holy cow!

00:12:38.720 --> 00:12:41.220
I think I saw
that at about 55-60.

00:12:41.220 --> 00:12:42.800
Oh, it didn't break the glue.

00:12:42.800 --> 00:12:45.300
It tore through
the popsicle stick.

00:12:45.300 --> 00:12:48.800
[Music]

00:12:48.800 --> 00:12:50.800
Glue made out of food at home.

00:12:50.800 --> 00:12:51.900
It is doable,

00:12:51.900 --> 00:12:53.935
and we got some
pretty awesome results.

00:12:53.935 --> 00:12:56.400
So with our glass glue
and our waterproof glue,

00:12:56.400 --> 00:12:57.606
it's going to work pretty well

00:12:57.606 --> 00:12:59.900
if you've got some light crafts,
you're working with kids,

00:12:59.900 --> 00:13:02.861
but I was very impressed
with our homemade flour paste

00:13:02.861 --> 00:13:03.700
and stick glue.

00:13:05.080 --> 00:13:06.000
Guys, that's not all.

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:07.341
We've always got
more fee to see.

This box up here at the top will
take you to our latest video.

00:13:09.794 --> 00:13:10.838
That box of the bottom is

00:13:10.838 --> 00:13:12.719
what YouTube thinks you
