00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.381
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:10.944 --> 00:00:12.360
Actually, it always
makes me laugh

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:13.710
when I hear that introduction.

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:16.230
And I'm introduced
as the Professor

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:18.900
for the Public
Understanding of Science.

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:20.700
Because I think
everyone expects that I

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:22.950
must know the whole
of science, and here I

00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:24.960
am to explain it to
the Royal Institution.

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:29.340
And certainly when I took over
this job, a lot of journalists

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:31.800
really did expect
that I knew it all.

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.050
And I would get phone
calls from journalists just

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:36.930
asking me to explain every
bit of science out there.

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:38.880
I remember one
particular occasion,

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:42.540
we'd just had the Nobel Prizes
announced over the last week.

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:44.940
And I remember the
Nobel Prize for medicine

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:46.170
had just been announced.

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:48.830
And this journalist phoned
me up and said, yes, just

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:51.750
been announced for the
discovery of telomeres.

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:53.520
Could you tell me
what a telomere is?

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:58.150
And I was like, well, I'm afraid
biology is not my strong point.

00:00:58.150 --> 00:00:59.610
So, I'm very
embarrassed to admit

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:02.160
that I was in fact in front
of my laptop at the time,

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:05.820
and I quickly pulled up the
Wikipedia page for telomeres

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:08.370
and then read very quickly
and confidently told

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:11.010
the journalist, yes, they're
the piece at the end of DNA

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:13.320
which controls how
long the DNA will last.

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.917
And the journalist
seemed quite happy.

00:01:15.917 --> 00:01:18.000
But I realised at that
point, well, this is crazy.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.360
You know, I can't be
expected to know it all.

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.520
Actually, you know, who
was the last scientist that

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:26.490
probably did know all the
science that was around

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:27.090
at the time?

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.550
I mean, maybe Newton or Galileo.

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:31.830
But certainly Newton,
the explosion of science

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:35.190
that happened post-Newton means
that probably after that, there

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:37.226
wasn't a scientist
that really could

00:01:37.226 --> 00:01:38.850
say that they knew
all the science that

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:40.620
was known at the time.

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:42.660
But it sort of got me
thinking, actually,

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:44.610
about the question of whether--

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:47.070
well, could science know it all?

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:48.540
Not one scientist,
but could there

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:51.780
come a point where
science might know it all?

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:55.080
Or might there be questions
that by their very nature

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:59.302
will always be beyond the
power of science to know?

00:01:59.302 --> 00:02:00.510
So, that's what I've been on.

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:03.270
It's a kind of journey
for the last three years,

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:07.170
trying to articulate whether
there are any questions that

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:10.229
by their nature might be
beyond the ability of science

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:11.730
to be able to answer them.

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:14.040
So, this is what I want to
tell you a little bit about,

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:17.190
this three-year journey I've
been on, culminating in this

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:19.250
book, What We Cannot Know.

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:22.650
I think that kind of expectation
that science might know it

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:25.279
all is partly fueled by the
fact that every time you

00:02:25.279 --> 00:02:26.820
open the newspaper,
there seems to be

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:29.570
another extraordinary
discovery that we've made.

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:33.240
And certainly since
I took over this job,

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:35.070
the sort of things
that we have discovered

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:38.040
are absolutely extraordinary.

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:41.160
We landed a spaceship the
size of a washing machine

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:42.990
on the side of a comet.

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:44.850
We've managed to
create robots which

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:46.260
have made their own language.

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:47.939
They're communicating
with each other.

00:02:47.939 --> 00:02:49.980
And we actually don't know
what this language is.

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:51.690
Machine learning has
given them the power

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:52.945
to create their own language.

00:02:52.945 --> 00:02:54.570
We've got to interact
with these robots

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:57.390
to understand what it is
they're talking about.

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:01.530
We've sequenced the DNA of
a 50,000-year-old cave girl.

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:03.450
And we're starting
to use stem cells

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:06.240
to repair the pancreas
of diabetic patients.

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:09.030
So, it is kind of extraordinary
just how much we know.

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:11.600
And I think it's given us that
expectation that, wow, yeah,

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:13.290
maybe science might
come to a point

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:17.230
where we can answer all the big
questions about the universe.

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:21.090
And I think that desire to
know is incredibly basic in us.

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:24.120
I think it's almost as basic
as the desire to reproduce.

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:27.600
It's sort of what has helped us
in our evolutionary survival.

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:30.900
And actually, I start the book
with a quote from Aristotle

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:31.770
from Metaphysics.

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:34.260
He declares at the opening
of the book, "Everyone

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:37.950
by nature desires to know."

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:40.470
But I think it's probably
very dangerous at any point

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:43.650
in history to
declare, well, we're

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:45.450
never going to be
able to answer this.

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:47.730
Because it's quite difficult
to know what it is that's

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:49.040
just going to be
around the corner.

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:51.289
I mean, when is there going
to be a new Einstein which

00:03:51.289 --> 00:03:54.240
completely revolutionises
our kind of perspective

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:55.320
on the universe.

00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:59.070
So, I kept a few stories in
mind just as a warning to me

00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:01.770
about declaring that this
is a question we will never

00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:03.180
be able to answer.

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:08.190
One of my favourites was
Auguste Comte who, in 1835,

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:12.360
very confidently declared, "We
shall never be able to study

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:16.260
by any methods the chemical
composition of stars."

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:18.149
And you know, it seems
a very fair comment.

00:04:18.149 --> 00:04:21.060
We still haven't visited a
star, dug a bit out of it,

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:22.955
and been able to
chemically analyse it.

00:04:22.955 --> 00:04:24.330
But of course,
what Auguste Comte

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:27.000
hadn't reckoned on
was well, actually,

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:28.800
although we haven't
visited a star,

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:31.260
every night, the star visits us.

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:34.770
So, the light from the
star several decades later

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:36.210
scientists are able to analyse.

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:38.250
And we have a very
complete description

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:40.410
of what stars are made out of.

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:43.760
So, I kept this as a kind of
little warning story to me that

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:47.490
to declare that something cannot
be known is like a red rag

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:49.957
to most scientists.

00:04:49.957 --> 00:04:51.540
Of course, you know,
I'm not the first

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:56.310
to kind of consider
questions of unknowns.

00:04:56.310 --> 00:05:00.045
One of our famous 21st century
philosophers, Donald Rumsfeld--

00:05:00.045 --> 00:05:01.230
[LAUGHTER]

00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:04.620
--very famously summed
up states of knowledge

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:06.930
in this very cryptic
answer that he

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:11.410
gave to questions about weapons
of mass destruction in Iraq.

00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:14.800
He declared, "There
are known knowns,

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:17.110
there are the things that
we know that we know.

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:19.670
We also know that there
are known unknowns.

00:05:19.670 --> 00:05:23.590
That is to say, we know there
are some things we do not know.

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:26.080
But there are also
unknown unknowns.

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:28.660
Those are the ones we
don't know we don't know."

00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:30.010
[LAUGHTER]

00:05:30.010 --> 00:05:32.440
And he got given the
Foot in the Mouth Award

00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:34.190
by the Plain English
Speaking Society

00:05:34.190 --> 00:05:38.050
for this response, which I
think is actually really unfair.

00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:40.750
Because I think this is
a fantastic description

00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:42.490
of different states
of knowledge.

00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:45.490
The known knowns, the things
that we have discovered.

00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:48.130
And in fact, the book is very
much about the things we know

00:05:48.130 --> 00:05:50.440
and how we'd known
them, and how they've

00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:53.002
changed, how our view of
the universe has changed.

00:05:53.002 --> 00:05:54.460
So, this is very
much a book trying

00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:57.670
to understand how we know
the things that we do know.

00:05:57.670 --> 00:06:00.142
The unknown unknowns, well,
they're very exciting.

00:06:00.142 --> 00:06:01.600
They're the things
I can't tell you

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:03.400
about because they are unknown.

00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:06.100
They're a bit like those black
swan events, the things which

00:06:06.100 --> 00:06:08.230
just come out of nowhere
and completely change

00:06:08.230 --> 00:06:10.460
your perspective
on the universe.

00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:12.310
Those are the exciting
things for science,

00:06:12.310 --> 00:06:14.800
but by their nature, I
cannot tell you about those.

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:16.600
So I'm after, in
this book, actually

00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:21.040
trying to pin down the known
unknowns and not the things

00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:23.590
that we don't know
now and we might know.

00:06:23.590 --> 00:06:26.630
Are there things that will
always remain unknowable?

00:06:26.630 --> 00:06:28.510
Actually, I think
Donald Rumsfeld

00:06:28.510 --> 00:06:32.300
missed a category here,
which are the unknown knowns.

00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:33.820
[LAUGHTER]

00:06:33.820 --> 00:06:36.610
Which actually, as
Slavoj Zizek pointed out,

00:06:36.610 --> 00:06:38.170
fairly significant
for a politician

00:06:38.170 --> 00:06:40.120
because there your kind
of Freudian beliefs,

00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:42.870
your delusions, the things
that you deny that you know

00:06:42.870 --> 00:06:44.800
but actually drive
all your decisions.

00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:47.860
So, maybe he missed
one category here.

00:06:47.860 --> 00:06:50.290
So, but I'm after these
known unknowns that

00:06:50.290 --> 00:06:53.320
might remain always unknowable.

00:06:53.320 --> 00:06:54.970
Now, one of the
other motivations

00:06:54.970 --> 00:06:58.510
for this journey I've been
on for the last three years

00:06:58.510 --> 00:07:01.750
is also partly to do with
the person that I took

00:07:01.750 --> 00:07:05.540
over this job from, a
certain Richard Dawkins who,

00:07:05.540 --> 00:07:07.810
as well as talking a lot
about evolutionary biology,

00:07:07.810 --> 00:07:11.110
spent a lot of the latter
end of his professorship

00:07:11.110 --> 00:07:14.770
talking not about science
but talking about religion.

00:07:14.770 --> 00:07:17.950
The god delusion got him
into a lot of arguments

00:07:17.950 --> 00:07:19.670
with various theologians.

00:07:19.670 --> 00:07:21.310
So, I kind of
braced myself when I

00:07:21.310 --> 00:07:25.570
took over this job for questions
not just about telomeres

00:07:25.570 --> 00:07:29.809
and science, but for questions
about my religious beliefs.

00:07:29.809 --> 00:07:31.850
So, I actually prepared
a little response to them

00:07:31.850 --> 00:07:34.960
because I sort of wanted to
put a little bit of distance

00:07:34.960 --> 00:07:37.360
from that debate
and to move back

00:07:37.360 --> 00:07:39.431
to sort of the public
understanding of science.

00:07:39.431 --> 00:07:41.930
So, I actually, when journalists
would ask me this question,

00:07:41.930 --> 00:07:42.880
I would say--

00:07:42.880 --> 00:07:47.110
actually, declare that I'm
a deeply religious man.

00:07:47.110 --> 00:07:49.570
And they were quite shocked
by this, quite excited.

00:07:49.570 --> 00:07:51.640
And before they
got too excited, I

00:07:51.640 --> 00:07:55.120
went on to explain that
my religion is the Arsenal

00:07:55.120 --> 00:07:55.761
Football Club--

00:07:55.761 --> 00:07:56.260
[LAUGHTER]

00:07:56.260 --> 00:07:59.650
--and every Saturday, I
go and worship my idols

00:07:59.650 --> 00:08:03.550
at the Emirates, formerly
Highbury Stadium.

00:08:03.550 --> 00:08:06.760
Every season I reaffirm my faith
that this will be the season

00:08:06.760 --> 00:08:08.220
that we win the premiership.

00:08:08.220 --> 00:08:11.170
And each season my faith seems
to be tested at the moment.

00:08:11.170 --> 00:08:13.820
But do we have any Spurs
fans in the audience?

00:08:13.820 --> 00:08:14.320
[LAUGHTER]

00:08:14.320 --> 00:08:16.210
Oh, look, they're all
in the front row here.

00:08:16.210 --> 00:08:19.010
Well, at least we have a very
good saint, St. Totteringham,

00:08:19.010 --> 00:08:21.070
who always ensures
that Arsenal are

00:08:21.070 --> 00:08:22.990
above Tottenham
in the premiership

00:08:22.990 --> 00:08:24.220
by the end of the season.

00:08:24.220 --> 00:08:26.050
It was a very late
arrival by our saint

00:08:26.050 --> 00:08:29.980
this year because it was the
last day that he actually

00:08:29.980 --> 00:08:32.659
came and made sure that
we ended up on top.

00:08:32.659 --> 00:08:35.799
So, that was my religion.

00:08:35.799 --> 00:08:38.260
Many journalists
were happy with that.

00:08:38.260 --> 00:08:40.299
But some were a little
bit more persistent.

00:08:40.299 --> 00:08:41.909
They said, no, come on, OK.

00:08:41.909 --> 00:08:44.290
What are your beliefs?

00:08:44.290 --> 00:08:49.450
And I remember especially one
Sunday morning on Northern

00:08:49.450 --> 00:08:53.470
Ireland BBC Radio on a
philosophy and religion

00:08:53.470 --> 00:08:57.430
programme, so, Northern
Ireland, Sunday morning,

00:08:57.430 --> 00:09:00.530
religion isn't too far
from people's thoughts.

00:09:00.530 --> 00:09:02.560
And I decided to go
on this programme.

00:09:02.560 --> 00:09:05.980
And I said, well, I'm very happy
to talk about the philosophy

00:09:05.980 --> 00:09:06.550
of science.

00:09:06.550 --> 00:09:09.400
But I really want to stay clear
of the religion questions.

00:09:09.400 --> 00:09:11.440
And the journalist
seemed quite happy

00:09:11.440 --> 00:09:14.740
and the little light went
red, and we went live.

00:09:14.740 --> 00:09:16.420
And then he went,
(IRISH ACCENT) so,

00:09:16.420 --> 00:09:17.770
Marcus, do you believe in God?

00:09:17.770 --> 00:09:18.885
[LAUGHTER]

00:09:18.885 --> 00:09:19.510
Oh, now, sorry.

00:09:19.510 --> 00:09:20.770
That was a dreadful
northern accent--

00:09:20.770 --> 00:09:21.970
Northern Ireland accent.

00:09:21.970 --> 00:09:23.961
I won't do those anymore.

00:09:23.961 --> 00:09:26.620
So, you know, the agreement
went out the window immediately.

00:09:26.620 --> 00:09:28.570
And we were straight
into a debate

00:09:28.570 --> 00:09:31.660
about the existence of god.

00:09:31.660 --> 00:09:35.830
And so, we had kind of a
quite heated to and fro.

00:09:35.830 --> 00:09:37.525
And at some point, I--

00:09:37.525 --> 00:09:39.730
you see, actually,
as a mathematician,

00:09:39.730 --> 00:09:42.820
I spend a lot of time proving
the existence of things

00:09:42.820 --> 00:09:45.610
or proving that certain
things cannot exist.

00:09:45.610 --> 00:09:48.550
For example, Andrew Wiles with
Fermat's Last Theorem proved

00:09:48.550 --> 00:09:51.730
that solutions cannot be
found for these equations.

00:09:51.730 --> 00:09:54.370
So, actually, we've got powerful
tools to prove that things

00:09:54.370 --> 00:09:56.260
exist or they don't.

00:09:56.260 --> 00:09:57.840
But if you're a
mathematician, you

00:09:57.840 --> 00:10:00.010
need a very clear
definition of what

00:10:00.010 --> 00:10:03.207
it is you're trying to
prove exists or not.

00:10:03.207 --> 00:10:05.290
So, I pushed the journalist,
and I said, OK, look,

00:10:05.290 --> 00:10:08.120
I'm prepared to engage my kind
of logical, mathematical mind

00:10:08.120 --> 00:10:08.620
on this.

00:10:08.620 --> 00:10:10.036
But I need a very
clear definition

00:10:10.036 --> 00:10:13.080
of what it is you mean by god.

00:10:13.080 --> 00:10:15.020
So, the journalist
then said, ah,

00:10:15.020 --> 00:10:17.960
but it's something which
transcends definition.

00:10:17.960 --> 00:10:21.700
It's beyond the ability
of the human mind to know.

00:10:21.700 --> 00:10:24.010
And either way, you've just
wiped me out of the game.

00:10:24.010 --> 00:10:26.420
How can we actually
engage with that?

00:10:26.420 --> 00:10:28.880
And I sort of went
away from the interview

00:10:28.880 --> 00:10:30.987
feeling a bit frustrated.

00:10:30.987 --> 00:10:32.570
But actually, it
sort of worked on me,

00:10:32.570 --> 00:10:37.070
that idea of god as defined
as the things we cannot know,

00:10:37.070 --> 00:10:40.250
the things which transcend
our understanding.

00:10:40.250 --> 00:10:42.170
And so, I began to
sort of play with that

00:10:42.170 --> 00:10:43.760
as an interesting idea.

00:10:43.760 --> 00:10:46.610
Well, yeah, what are those
things that we will never know,

00:10:46.610 --> 00:10:49.100
and what sort of
role might they play?

00:10:49.100 --> 00:10:50.830
Actually, as a god.

00:10:50.830 --> 00:10:53.960
And actually, a few
years ago, I took part

00:10:53.960 --> 00:10:57.676
in a debate with the Chief
Rabbi during Jewish book week.

00:10:57.676 --> 00:10:59.300
And he wrote this
wonderful book called

00:10:59.300 --> 00:11:01.216
"Science and Religion,
The Great Partnership,"

00:11:01.216 --> 00:11:04.070
about how actually, science
and religion are involved

00:11:04.070 --> 00:11:05.930
in similar kind of big--

00:11:05.930 --> 00:11:08.120
trying to answer
the big questions.

00:11:08.120 --> 00:11:09.680
And in preparation
for that debate,

00:11:09.680 --> 00:11:11.930
I actually talked to a
philosophy friend of mine

00:11:11.930 --> 00:11:15.860
at New College in
Oxford, trying to prepare

00:11:15.860 --> 00:11:18.260
for talking to the Chief Rabbi.

00:11:18.260 --> 00:11:20.600
And this philosopher
actually referred me

00:11:20.600 --> 00:11:25.085
to a very interesting
theologian, Herbert McCabe.

00:11:25.085 --> 00:11:27.576
He was actually a Marxist
theologian in Oxford.

00:11:27.576 --> 00:11:28.450
Get that, quite cool.

00:11:28.450 --> 00:11:30.320
A Marxist theologian.

00:11:30.320 --> 00:11:34.095
He has a lot of kind of strange
texts on Christian liturgy

00:11:34.095 --> 00:11:34.970
and things like that.

00:11:34.970 --> 00:11:36.740
But there was one
essay that I read

00:11:36.740 --> 00:11:39.170
which was very interesting
because in it, he

00:11:39.170 --> 00:11:42.640
makes the following statement,
"To assert the existence of God

00:11:42.640 --> 00:11:45.410
is to claim that there
is an unanswered question

00:11:45.410 --> 00:11:47.050
about the universe."

00:11:47.050 --> 00:11:49.610
And actually, he goes on to say
that many religions committed

00:11:49.610 --> 00:11:53.870
iconoclasm actually by giving
this quite abstract idea far

00:11:53.870 --> 00:11:56.180
too many properties that
it never should have had.

00:11:56.180 --> 00:11:57.971
And of course, that's
what we get served up

00:11:57.971 --> 00:12:00.850
as kids, this kind of
rather silly version.

00:12:00.850 --> 00:12:02.390
And we reject it quite quickly.

00:12:02.390 --> 00:12:05.237
I certainly did when I came
up to my comrades in school

00:12:05.237 --> 00:12:06.820
and started learning
a bit of science.

00:12:06.820 --> 00:12:09.320
And just, the other thing
didn't make sense at all.

00:12:09.320 --> 00:12:11.564
But maybe we throw too
much out with that.

00:12:11.564 --> 00:12:12.980
And maybe there
is still something

00:12:12.980 --> 00:12:16.646
interesting to tease out
as kind of the unknowns.

00:12:16.646 --> 00:12:18.020
And of course,
they were always--

00:12:18.020 --> 00:12:20.930
the god was those unknowns,
volcanoes or earthquakes,

00:12:20.930 --> 00:12:21.950
or things.

00:12:21.950 --> 00:12:24.770
But as science has gotten
to know more and more,

00:12:24.770 --> 00:12:27.840
that sort of unknown has
gotten smaller and smaller.

00:12:27.840 --> 00:12:30.680
In fact, there's a term,
the God of the gaps, which

00:12:30.680 --> 00:12:32.390
you may have heard
of, which actually

00:12:32.390 --> 00:12:38.090
was a derogatory term created by
theologians saying that science

00:12:38.090 --> 00:12:41.900
isn't kind of eliminating God,
that we're meant to know God.

00:12:41.900 --> 00:12:43.670
So, it was actually
a derogatory term.

00:12:43.670 --> 00:12:45.530
But partly, my
mission in this book

00:12:45.530 --> 00:12:48.421
was just to explore
whether we could reclaim

00:12:48.421 --> 00:12:50.420
the God of the gaps as
actually a positive thing

00:12:50.420 --> 00:12:52.340
and whether it actually
has some value.

00:12:52.340 --> 00:12:55.910
By identifying things
beyond science,

00:12:55.910 --> 00:12:58.010
might they have something
interesting to say

00:12:58.010 --> 00:12:59.300
about that idea.

00:12:59.300 --> 00:13:01.120
So, I sort of kept
that in mind as well

00:13:01.120 --> 00:13:05.820
on my journey into the unknown,
to the edges and beyond.

00:13:05.820 --> 00:13:08.030
So, the book, I
divided up into edges.

00:13:08.030 --> 00:13:10.820
I've got seven
edges of knowledge

00:13:10.820 --> 00:13:14.210
that I believe have perhaps
potential for questions

00:13:14.210 --> 00:13:16.502
that might be beyond
the world of science.

00:13:16.502 --> 00:13:18.710
So, I want to give you a
little bit of a guided tour.

00:13:18.710 --> 00:13:20.960
And we'll go into depth
in a couple of them.

00:13:20.960 --> 00:13:23.660
And I'll show you some
of the other challenges

00:13:23.660 --> 00:13:25.469
that I think are out there.

00:13:25.469 --> 00:13:27.260
I'm just going to start
with the first edge

00:13:27.260 --> 00:13:30.440
because that's very much at
the heart of my own subject

00:13:30.440 --> 00:13:31.370
of mathematics.

00:13:31.370 --> 00:13:34.880
And this is the challenge
of can we know the future

00:13:34.880 --> 00:13:36.710
before it becomes the present?

00:13:36.710 --> 00:13:38.580
Can we predict what's
going to happen next?

00:13:38.580 --> 00:13:40.280
And a lot of us want to do that.

00:13:40.280 --> 00:13:41.930
We really need to
know in order to be

00:13:41.930 --> 00:13:45.680
able to plan what's going to
happen next and make decisions.

00:13:45.680 --> 00:13:47.800
We would like to have
that kind of knowledge.

00:13:47.800 --> 00:13:50.730
So, is it possible to know
what's going to happen next?

00:13:50.730 --> 00:13:53.150
Naturally, on my journey
to the edges of knowledge,

00:13:53.150 --> 00:13:56.130
I took with me an
object in each edge.

00:13:56.130 --> 00:13:58.220
So, each edge has
an object associated

00:13:58.220 --> 00:14:02.120
with it, which kind of gives me
a useful tool to kind of tease

00:14:02.120 --> 00:14:03.380
out this particular challenge.

00:14:03.380 --> 00:14:06.140
So, the object I took
with me on my journey

00:14:06.140 --> 00:14:09.410
to the edge of trying to predict
the future was an object which

00:14:09.410 --> 00:14:11.390
I think really sort
of captures the idea

00:14:11.390 --> 00:14:14.480
of the unknowable,
the unpredictable.

00:14:14.480 --> 00:14:15.540
It's a casino dice.

00:14:15.540 --> 00:14:17.720
So, I mean, the
excitement of a dice

00:14:17.720 --> 00:14:19.670
is that we don't know
what's going to happen

00:14:19.670 --> 00:14:20.990
when we throw it on the table.

00:14:20.990 --> 00:14:23.100
So, this time I got a six.

00:14:23.100 --> 00:14:25.250
But there's a kind of
feeling like, oh, come on,

00:14:25.250 --> 00:14:27.440
surely actually
science could know.

00:14:27.440 --> 00:14:29.300
I mean, mathematics
has a lot of tools

00:14:29.300 --> 00:14:31.910
to be able to work out what's
going to happen as that falls,

00:14:31.910 --> 00:14:33.770
hits the table, rolls.

00:14:33.770 --> 00:14:35.804
And certainly, I
thought that maybe, you

00:14:35.804 --> 00:14:38.220
know, the mathematical things
I've learned over the years,

00:14:38.220 --> 00:14:40.686
perhaps, I could use
these to actually cash

00:14:40.686 --> 00:14:41.810
in and make a lot of money.

00:14:41.810 --> 00:14:43.760
So, I went off to Vegas.

00:14:43.760 --> 00:14:45.410
And I went to the craps tables.

00:14:45.410 --> 00:14:48.530
And I decided, yeah, this is
just a problem in dynamics.

00:14:48.530 --> 00:14:50.150
I can analyse this.

00:14:50.150 --> 00:14:52.220
And I tried to
apply my maths to be

00:14:52.220 --> 00:14:54.970
able to make some predictions
about how this falls.

00:14:54.970 --> 00:14:57.320
Unfortunately, I
lost a lot of money.

00:14:57.320 --> 00:14:58.020
[LAUGHTER]

00:14:58.020 --> 00:15:00.291
But they let me keep the
casino dice we played with.

00:15:00.291 --> 00:15:01.790
So, this is actually
the casino dice

00:15:01.790 --> 00:15:04.100
that I brought back from Vegas.

00:15:04.100 --> 00:15:07.550
But you know, I think,
how unknowable is this?

00:15:07.550 --> 00:15:09.260
And I think it's
my hero, I guess,

00:15:09.260 --> 00:15:11.450
in this story is Isaac Newton.

00:15:11.450 --> 00:15:14.990
Because he did give us the tools
to give us that kind of belief

00:15:14.990 --> 00:15:16.730
that actually we
should be able to know

00:15:16.730 --> 00:15:18.260
what this is going to do next.

00:15:18.260 --> 00:15:20.420
The laws of motion
tell us how this

00:15:20.420 --> 00:15:22.612
is going to fall from
my hand, what's going

00:15:22.612 --> 00:15:23.820
to happen when it-- oh, gosh.

00:15:23.820 --> 00:15:24.860
[LAUGHTER]

00:15:24.860 --> 00:15:28.430
That's kind of unpredictable,
but as it cascades

00:15:28.430 --> 00:15:31.280
across the RI Lecture Theatre.

00:15:31.280 --> 00:15:33.800
And then the tools
of the calculus.

00:15:33.800 --> 00:15:38.330
Calculus gives us a mathematical
language to be able to analyse

00:15:38.330 --> 00:15:40.460
a world in flux,
a changing world.

00:15:40.460 --> 00:15:44.360
To be able to understand the
speed of this as it changes.

00:15:44.360 --> 00:15:46.340
So, you know, Newton
gave scientists

00:15:46.340 --> 00:15:49.820
that belief that maybe, yeah,
if we know the equations,

00:15:49.820 --> 00:15:51.357
we know how the
universe is set up,

00:15:51.357 --> 00:15:52.940
then everything is
just deterministic.

00:15:52.940 --> 00:15:55.550
It just follows from
the mathematics.

00:15:55.550 --> 00:15:58.790
So, Newton gave scientists
post-Newton that belief

00:15:58.790 --> 00:16:01.400
that maybe we can
know the future

00:16:01.400 --> 00:16:03.060
before it becomes the presence.

00:16:03.060 --> 00:16:04.560
Laplace certainly
talked about that.

00:16:04.560 --> 00:16:06.750
We have this thing,
Laplace's demon,

00:16:06.750 --> 00:16:09.890
we just kind of says, yeah,
if you know the universe,

00:16:09.890 --> 00:16:12.060
you'll know everything
into the future.

00:16:12.060 --> 00:16:15.350
Well, if Newton is my
hero, then this guy here

00:16:15.350 --> 00:16:18.030
is my nemesis in this story.

00:16:18.030 --> 00:16:20.780
This is Henri Poincare
who discovered

00:16:20.780 --> 00:16:23.240
the mathematics of chaos
theory at the beginning

00:16:23.240 --> 00:16:25.200
of the 20th century.

00:16:25.200 --> 00:16:28.737
And he explained how, even
if you do have the equations

00:16:28.737 --> 00:16:31.070
and you have a very good
description of how the thing is

00:16:31.070 --> 00:16:34.430
set up, just a very small error
can cause your predictions

00:16:34.430 --> 00:16:38.240
to be completely untenable, and
something completely different

00:16:38.240 --> 00:16:39.320
can happen.

00:16:39.320 --> 00:16:41.810
And this can control
just very simple systems,

00:16:41.810 --> 00:16:45.110
which you have the
equations for, can give rise

00:16:45.110 --> 00:16:47.370
to incredibly complex behaviour.

00:16:47.370 --> 00:16:50.870
And one of my favourite
examples is a pendulum.

00:16:50.870 --> 00:16:52.640
So, actually, a
pendulum is usually

00:16:52.640 --> 00:16:56.157
so predictable we use it
to keep track of time.

00:16:56.157 --> 00:16:58.490
But this is a slightly different
pendulum I've got here.

00:16:58.490 --> 00:17:00.170
It's called a double pendulum.

00:17:00.170 --> 00:17:03.960
So, it's got two pieces
of metal jointed together

00:17:03.960 --> 00:17:05.390
a little bit like a leg.

00:17:05.390 --> 00:17:07.200
So, the geometry,
mathematics of this

00:17:07.200 --> 00:17:11.450
is very simple to describe
these two pieces of metal.

00:17:11.450 --> 00:17:14.390
The physics which controls
how this will fall

00:17:14.390 --> 00:17:16.490
is also not that complicated.

00:17:16.490 --> 00:17:19.220
But being able to use that to
protect the behaviour of this

00:17:19.220 --> 00:17:22.628
thing is almost impossible.

00:17:22.628 --> 00:17:26.030
[LAUGHTER]

00:17:26.030 --> 00:17:27.521
Whoa!

00:17:27.521 --> 00:17:31.130
[LAUGHTER]

00:17:31.130 --> 00:17:31.940
Oh, look at that.

00:17:31.940 --> 00:17:33.800
And I think the fact
that you're laughing

00:17:33.800 --> 00:17:36.860
is a perfect example of the
fact that this is unpredictable.

00:17:36.860 --> 00:17:38.600
Laughter is A
response to whoa, I

00:17:38.600 --> 00:17:41.190
wasn't expecting that to happen.

00:17:41.190 --> 00:17:44.750
But the real challenge of chaos
theory that Poincare raises is,

00:17:44.750 --> 00:17:46.670
OK, that was very
complex behaviour,

00:17:46.670 --> 00:17:48.952
but can I repeat the
exact same behaviour?

00:17:48.952 --> 00:17:50.660
And actually, I have
a little notch here.

00:17:50.660 --> 00:17:53.970
And I try and start the pendulum
off in exactly the same place.

00:17:53.970 --> 00:17:55.400
So, let's see
whether-- if you can

00:17:55.400 --> 00:17:56.649
remember what it did before.

00:17:56.649 --> 00:17:57.440
Is it going to do--

00:17:57.440 --> 00:17:58.664
[LAUGHTER]

00:17:59.480 --> 00:18:01.154
Whoa.

00:18:01.154 --> 00:18:03.320
That's already doing something
completely different.

00:18:03.320 --> 00:18:06.020
I mean, it's still
quite funky, but--

00:18:06.020 --> 00:18:08.260
OK, and then it seems to have--

00:18:08.260 --> 00:18:09.610
this my favourite desktop toy.

00:18:09.610 --> 00:18:11.360
I can play with this
for absolutely hours.

00:18:11.360 --> 00:18:13.270
So, if you'll indulge me, I'm
just going to do one more--

00:18:13.270 --> 00:18:13.770
[LAUGHTER]

00:18:13.770 --> 00:18:14.951
--because it's just that--

00:18:14.951 --> 00:18:15.451
Whoa.

00:18:18.930 --> 00:18:21.375
Oh, whoa!

00:18:21.375 --> 00:18:22.386
[LAUGHTER]

00:18:22.386 --> 00:18:23.760
I mean, where did
that come from?

00:18:23.760 --> 00:18:24.750
Unbelievable!

00:18:24.750 --> 00:18:25.254
Whoa!

00:18:25.254 --> 00:18:26.420
Give it a round of applause.

00:18:26.420 --> 00:18:27.090
That's a--

00:18:27.090 --> 00:18:28.463
[APPLAUSE]

00:18:28.463 --> 00:18:29.389
[LAUGHS]

00:18:32.630 --> 00:18:36.410
So, this is the challenge of
chaos theory is actually very

00:18:36.410 --> 00:18:39.220
complex behaviour but it's being
able to repeat that behaviour.

00:18:39.220 --> 00:18:41.480
So, I've got another
desktop toy, actually,

00:18:41.480 --> 00:18:45.230
which I have on my desk at home.

00:18:45.230 --> 00:18:46.190
It's again a pendulum.

00:18:46.190 --> 00:18:49.430
But it's got six magnets
which attract the pendulum.

00:18:49.430 --> 00:18:51.360
And over each
magnate is actually

00:18:51.360 --> 00:18:52.360
an answer to a question.

00:18:52.360 --> 00:18:54.940
So, I use this to make all my
decisions in life, actually.

00:18:54.940 --> 00:18:55.750
[LAUGHTER]

00:18:55.750 --> 00:18:57.510
So, you can ask it a question.

00:18:57.510 --> 00:18:59.930
So, for example,
should I make a bet

00:18:59.930 --> 00:19:03.044
on Arsenal beating
Swansea on Saturday?

00:19:03.044 --> 00:19:05.210
So, we get-- I'm just going
to set this thing going.

00:19:05.210 --> 00:19:07.730
So, the answer's are like try
again, no way, definitely,

00:19:07.730 --> 00:19:10.280
maybe, yes, ask a friend.

00:19:10.280 --> 00:19:12.810
So, here's a little
one we did in the lab.

00:19:12.810 --> 00:19:14.800
So, this is an example
of this pendulum.

00:19:14.800 --> 00:19:16.370
Oh, I've got just
three magnets here.

00:19:16.370 --> 00:19:19.190
But you try and predict
which magnet the pendulum is

00:19:19.190 --> 00:19:20.090
going to end up at.

00:19:20.090 --> 00:19:22.169
I mean, I see this
wobble between them all.

00:19:22.169 --> 00:19:23.710
Is it going to end
up at the top one?

00:19:23.710 --> 00:19:26.960
And then right at the last,
it ends up at the bottom one.

00:19:26.960 --> 00:19:28.340
But it seems incredible.

00:19:28.340 --> 00:19:29.000
So, here we go.

00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:29.345
Maybe.

00:19:29.345 --> 00:19:30.540
Well, that's not good enough.

00:19:30.540 --> 00:19:31.040
[LAUGHTER]

00:19:31.040 --> 00:19:35.780
[MUMBLES] So, actually,
the challenge--

00:19:35.780 --> 00:19:39.590
I mean, this is a bit like
an asteroid flying around,

00:19:39.590 --> 00:19:41.175
and the magnets
are like planets.

00:19:41.175 --> 00:19:42.800
And you've got to
try and decide, well,

00:19:42.800 --> 00:19:46.370
which planet is going to get
wiped out by this asteroid?

00:19:46.370 --> 00:19:49.490
In fact, Poincare
discovered this chaos theory

00:19:49.490 --> 00:19:51.710
when he was trying to
understand the solar system

00:19:51.710 --> 00:19:54.260
to see whether the solar
system was stable or not.

00:19:54.260 --> 00:19:55.910
And what he-- oh,
it says definitely.

00:19:55.910 --> 00:19:56.430
Great Yes.

00:19:56.430 --> 00:19:56.930
[LAUGHTER]

00:19:56.930 --> 00:19:59.782
It's always right.

00:19:59.782 --> 00:20:02.060
And he understood that
even the solar system,

00:20:02.060 --> 00:20:04.250
trying to predict whether
that is stable or not,

00:20:04.250 --> 00:20:07.730
it's incredibly sensitive
to just very small changes

00:20:07.730 --> 00:20:10.160
in where the asteroid is.

00:20:10.160 --> 00:20:12.210
So, here's three
computer models that I

00:20:12.210 --> 00:20:16.710
did of where the pendulum
is going to end up.

00:20:16.710 --> 00:20:20.020
So, I've coloured those three
magnets yellow, red, and blue.

00:20:20.020 --> 00:20:21.410
And I've started
the pendulum off

00:20:21.410 --> 00:20:23.360
in the top left hand corner.

00:20:23.360 --> 00:20:27.080
The first experiment, the thing
wiped out the blue planet.

00:20:27.080 --> 00:20:30.107
But then, I changed the
sixth decimal place of one

00:20:30.107 --> 00:20:31.940
of the coordinates of
the starting position.

00:20:31.940 --> 00:20:34.420
So, you can't even
see that it's changed.

00:20:34.420 --> 00:20:37.040
But when I then ran
the model, well, it

00:20:37.040 --> 00:20:38.840
sort of followed the
same path for a while

00:20:38.840 --> 00:20:40.460
and then completely
veered off and did

00:20:40.460 --> 00:20:41.870
something completely different.

00:20:41.870 --> 00:20:43.860
That time, it wiped
out the red planet.

00:20:43.860 --> 00:20:46.430
Now, then I changed the
sixth decimal place again.

00:20:46.430 --> 00:20:48.200
Again, a similar
sort of trajectory

00:20:48.200 --> 00:20:50.430
to start with and then
wipes out the yellow planet.

00:20:50.430 --> 00:20:54.020
So, that very small change
causes a massive difference

00:20:54.020 --> 00:20:55.620
in the outcome.

00:20:55.620 --> 00:20:58.760
And so, this is incredibly
difficult to predict.

00:20:58.760 --> 00:21:02.930
Even though I have the equations
and I might have very accurate

00:21:02.930 --> 00:21:04.850
knowledge about the
starting position,

00:21:04.850 --> 00:21:06.830
unless I have
complete knowledge,

00:21:06.830 --> 00:21:09.380
I really cannot know what
the answer is going to be.

00:21:09.380 --> 00:21:12.680
And this computer graphic
helps you to try and make

00:21:12.680 --> 00:21:16.040
a prediction about where
the pendulum will end up.

00:21:16.040 --> 00:21:19.160
So, if I start the pendulum
over a yellow region,

00:21:19.160 --> 00:21:20.840
that means that the
pendulum is going

00:21:20.840 --> 00:21:23.150
to end up at the yellow magnet.

00:21:23.150 --> 00:21:26.300
So, you can see there are some
regions which are knowable.

00:21:26.300 --> 00:21:27.410
I mean, if you're--

00:21:27.410 --> 00:21:29.960
so, the yellow magnet is sitting
under that big, yellow blob

00:21:29.960 --> 00:21:30.630
there.

00:21:30.630 --> 00:21:32.470
And sure enough, if
I start the magnet--

00:21:32.470 --> 00:21:34.746
the pendulum next to
the yellow magnet,

00:21:34.746 --> 00:21:36.120
then the other
two can't pull it.

00:21:36.120 --> 00:21:37.870
And so, it's just going
to wobble and then

00:21:37.870 --> 00:21:39.860
settle on the yellow magnet.

00:21:39.860 --> 00:21:42.980
There's another area sort of
opposite the yellow magnet,

00:21:42.980 --> 00:21:45.850
which if I start it there,
it's again, quite predictable.

00:21:45.850 --> 00:21:49.130
A little error won't cause it to
do anything terribly different.

00:21:49.130 --> 00:21:50.990
It will just swing
backwards and forwards,

00:21:50.990 --> 00:21:52.531
and eventually, the
other two magnets

00:21:52.531 --> 00:21:53.660
can't pull at either side.

00:21:53.660 --> 00:21:55.610
It ends up again at
the yellow magnet.

00:21:55.610 --> 00:21:59.450
But I started my pendulum
in the top left hand corner.

00:21:59.450 --> 00:22:03.040
And this is an example of
something called a fractal.

00:22:03.040 --> 00:22:06.050
So, a fractal are these
mathematical geometric shapes

00:22:06.050 --> 00:22:08.310
which have infinite complexity.

00:22:08.310 --> 00:22:11.270
So, as I zoom in on this
area, it never simplifies.

00:22:11.270 --> 00:22:13.610
It never suddenly becomes,
oh, now, it's all yellow.

00:22:13.610 --> 00:22:17.810
So, I know that if I've got
the accuracy up to this point,

00:22:17.810 --> 00:22:20.000
I know it's going to
hit the yellow magnet.

00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:22.580
It just keeps on being yellow,
blue, red, yellow, blue red.

00:22:22.580 --> 00:22:25.430
As I zoom in, I try to get
more and more accurate.

00:22:25.430 --> 00:22:27.860
Still, the 50th decimal
place can tip it over

00:22:27.860 --> 00:22:29.790
from being yellow to blue.

00:22:29.790 --> 00:22:32.570
So, this is a region which
says, if you're here,

00:22:32.570 --> 00:22:35.810
you really cannot know what
is going to happen next.

00:22:35.810 --> 00:22:38.240
So, you've got that
infinite sensitivity

00:22:38.240 --> 00:22:39.950
to just a very small change.

00:22:39.950 --> 00:22:41.720
call the butterfly effect.

00:22:41.720 --> 00:22:44.630
Now, of course, the trouble
is that chaotic dynamics

00:22:44.630 --> 00:22:47.660
affect so many things we would
like to know about the future.

00:22:47.660 --> 00:22:50.660
The weather, for example,
the solar system,

00:22:50.660 --> 00:22:52.610
even population dynamics.

00:22:52.610 --> 00:22:54.650
And so, actually, I took
with me on my journey

00:22:54.650 --> 00:22:59.040
to each of these edges an
expert in this area, somebody

00:22:59.040 --> 00:23:03.690
who's been at this edge trying
to push it ever further.

00:23:03.690 --> 00:23:05.675
So, the expert I took
actually on my journey

00:23:05.675 --> 00:23:07.550
to try and predict the
future was a colleague

00:23:07.550 --> 00:23:11.970
of mine in Oxford, Bob May who
is a mathematical biologist.

00:23:11.970 --> 00:23:14.060
And he was one of the
people who understood

00:23:14.060 --> 00:23:17.420
that population dynamics, a
very simple sort of feedback

00:23:17.420 --> 00:23:21.380
equation, which controls the
population of animals from one

00:23:21.380 --> 00:23:24.680
season to another, can also
have this incredible sensitivity

00:23:24.680 --> 00:23:26.640
to small changes.

00:23:26.640 --> 00:23:28.974
So, I went to go and talk
to him about his ideas.

00:23:28.974 --> 00:23:30.140
Actually, he's now Lord May.

00:23:30.140 --> 00:23:32.360
I shouldn't call him
Bob May, Lord May.

00:23:32.360 --> 00:23:35.930
He's a cross-party member
of the House of Lords.

00:23:35.930 --> 00:23:39.050
And he's actually working
with Andrew Haldane

00:23:39.050 --> 00:23:42.530
at the Bank of England trying
to look now not at population

00:23:42.530 --> 00:23:45.824
dynamics but at
the economy to see

00:23:45.824 --> 00:23:47.990
whether the economy, the
equations for the economy--

00:23:47.990 --> 00:23:52.010
it's just data and numbers and
kind of rules which control how

00:23:52.010 --> 00:23:54.110
those numbers will evolve.

00:23:54.110 --> 00:23:56.810
They're trying to see whether
the banking crisis of 2008

00:23:56.810 --> 00:24:00.110
might have been a result of
very sort of chaotic motion

00:24:00.110 --> 00:24:02.560
that would have been
very hard to predict.

00:24:02.560 --> 00:24:04.310
So, he's actually
working with government,

00:24:04.310 --> 00:24:07.670
trying to explain to
them the limitations

00:24:07.670 --> 00:24:09.770
of being able to know
what's going to happen next,

00:24:09.770 --> 00:24:12.920
even if you know the
theory which controls it.

00:24:12.920 --> 00:24:15.470
And I went and had lunch with
him at the House of Lords,

00:24:15.470 --> 00:24:18.740
and he made this statement to
me while we were having lunch.

00:24:18.740 --> 00:24:21.650
He said, "Not only in research
but in the everyday world

00:24:21.650 --> 00:24:24.650
of politics and economics, we
would be better off if more

00:24:24.650 --> 00:24:28.040
people realised that simple
systems do not necessarily

00:24:28.040 --> 00:24:30.944
possess simple
dynamic properties."

00:24:30.944 --> 00:24:32.360
So, I asked him
how he was getting

00:24:32.360 --> 00:24:35.120
on trying to explain some
mathematics of chaos theory

00:24:35.120 --> 00:24:36.984
to the MPs at Westminster.

00:24:36.984 --> 00:24:39.650
And he said, no, Marcus, they're
mostly interested in their egos

00:24:39.650 --> 00:24:41.864
here, not in mathematics.

00:24:41.864 --> 00:24:43.280
But then I came
back to this dice.

00:24:43.280 --> 00:24:44.113
And I was intrigued.

00:24:44.113 --> 00:24:46.820
Well, is the reason that
I can't know this dice

00:24:46.820 --> 00:24:49.670
because the dynamics
are chaotic?

00:24:49.670 --> 00:24:51.350
And I got a little
bit of a surprise.

00:24:51.350 --> 00:24:53.270
I discovered a piece
of research that

00:24:53.270 --> 00:24:57.290
had been done just recently
by some Polish mathematicians.

00:24:57.290 --> 00:25:00.680
They've used high-speed
cameras to record

00:25:00.680 --> 00:25:04.400
what the dice is doing as
it hits the table and rolls.

00:25:04.400 --> 00:25:08.330
And they've actually understood
that in some circumstances

00:25:08.330 --> 00:25:11.240
this is much more knowable
and you might think.

00:25:11.240 --> 00:25:14.581
So, actually, I've coloured
the faces of the dice different

00:25:14.581 --> 00:25:15.080
colours.

00:25:15.080 --> 00:25:17.480
And we're going to draw
some similar pictures

00:25:17.480 --> 00:25:20.300
to the one for predicting where
the pendulum is going to go,

00:25:20.300 --> 00:25:25.190
which will help us to know
what arrangement of the dice

00:25:25.190 --> 00:25:27.500
do I need to make it
land, say, on the red side

00:25:27.500 --> 00:25:28.850
or the blue side.

00:25:28.850 --> 00:25:33.050
So, here are the pictures
that the Polish team created.

00:25:33.050 --> 00:25:35.930
And the interesting one is
the top left hand picture.

00:25:35.930 --> 00:25:39.320
Because in this picture,
the colours are not fractal.

00:25:39.320 --> 00:25:42.440
It's a very clear sort
of signal about where

00:25:42.440 --> 00:25:43.800
this thing is going to land.

00:25:43.800 --> 00:25:45.560
So, what this is
measuring on the two axes

00:25:45.560 --> 00:25:48.929
is on one axis is the
height above the table,

00:25:48.929 --> 00:25:50.720
and the other one is
the angle at which you

00:25:50.720 --> 00:25:52.760
launch the dice from your hand.

00:25:52.760 --> 00:25:54.830
And because this
picture isn't fractal,

00:25:54.830 --> 00:25:57.080
it means that actually
a small change

00:25:57.080 --> 00:26:00.300
isn't going to alter the side
that it's going to fall on.

00:26:00.300 --> 00:26:03.500
So, the table that's
being described

00:26:03.500 --> 00:26:06.710
in this particular
picture is a craps table,

00:26:06.710 --> 00:26:08.570
which actually is quite soft.

00:26:08.570 --> 00:26:13.580
And the dice dissipates a lot of
energy when it hits the table.

00:26:13.580 --> 00:26:16.770
So, it's kind of like a bit of
an old, squidgy, craps table.

00:26:16.770 --> 00:26:19.480
So, you know, perhaps a casino
that's seen better days.

00:26:19.480 --> 00:26:22.100
So, this is the one that
you should go after.

00:26:22.100 --> 00:26:24.830
Because it turns
out that actually

00:26:24.830 --> 00:26:28.170
if the dice is losing a lot of
energy as it hits the table,

00:26:28.170 --> 00:26:30.950
if it's a soft
table, then actually,

00:26:30.950 --> 00:26:32.660
this thing is quite predictable.

00:26:32.660 --> 00:26:34.160
And so, if you
take one thing away

00:26:34.160 --> 00:26:37.880
from this talk and my book,
it's the following, OK?

00:26:37.880 --> 00:26:41.540
More often than not,
there's a higher probability

00:26:41.540 --> 00:26:43.840
that when you play
on such a table

00:26:43.840 --> 00:26:47.120
that when you release the
dice, it will actually

00:26:47.120 --> 00:26:50.060
land on the face which is
down on the palm of your hand

00:26:50.060 --> 00:26:51.480
when you release it.

00:26:51.480 --> 00:26:53.390
So, I wonder whether--

00:26:53.390 --> 00:26:55.380
well, let's take this off.

00:26:55.380 --> 00:26:56.660
Let's make a soft craps table.

00:26:56.660 --> 00:26:57.210
Oh, gosh.

00:26:57.210 --> 00:26:58.900
Yes, no, I have to--

00:26:58.900 --> 00:27:02.750
I forgot-- well, I'll try
and get dressed in a bit.

00:27:02.750 --> 00:27:04.730
So, let's make
this kind of soft.

00:27:04.730 --> 00:27:07.430
And let's see whether
we can make this work.

00:27:07.430 --> 00:27:08.480
All right, so, OK.

00:27:08.480 --> 00:27:09.950
So, I'm going to have
the six on the bottom.

00:27:09.950 --> 00:27:11.000
So, I'm going to
try and get a six.

00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:12.680
So, I'm going to let this fall.

00:27:12.680 --> 00:27:13.512
Oh, it's a one.

00:27:13.512 --> 00:27:14.011
Oh.

00:27:14.011 --> 00:27:16.316
[LAUGHTER]

00:27:16.316 --> 00:27:17.612
Well, that's a bit rough.

00:27:17.612 --> 00:27:19.070
That's why I chose
maths, you know?

00:27:19.070 --> 00:27:20.960
The proofs make sure
all these things work.

00:27:20.960 --> 00:27:22.010
But actually, you
know, of course,

00:27:22.010 --> 00:27:23.134
it's a probabilistic thing.

00:27:23.134 --> 00:27:26.750
So, more than likely, so,
one in six times that works.

00:27:26.750 --> 00:27:30.410
[LAUGHTER]

00:27:30.410 --> 00:27:32.400
But as the table gets
more and more rigid,

00:27:32.400 --> 00:27:35.120
so, the table I got here
is a very rigid table,

00:27:35.120 --> 00:27:36.170
and it bounces a lot.

00:27:36.170 --> 00:27:38.510
This is described by
the pictures which are

00:27:38.510 --> 00:27:40.370
becoming more and more fractal.

00:27:40.370 --> 00:27:43.310
So, it says that on this table,
again, a very small change,

00:27:43.310 --> 00:27:45.440
that butterfly
effect we call it,

00:27:45.440 --> 00:27:48.085
a very small change can cause it
to go from the four to the six

00:27:48.085 --> 00:27:49.220
to the one.

00:27:49.220 --> 00:27:52.400
And again, it says that you
cannot know what this dice d

00:27:52.400 --> 00:27:54.510
going to do next.

00:27:54.510 --> 00:27:59.660
Now, that edge is actually under
very classical 19th century

00:27:59.660 --> 00:28:00.820
ideas of science.

00:28:00.820 --> 00:28:02.630
But of course in
the 20th century,

00:28:02.630 --> 00:28:06.470
we realised that maybe the
universe isn't as predictable

00:28:06.470 --> 00:28:09.766
and deterministic as
Newton actually thought.

00:28:09.766 --> 00:28:11.390
And so, the next edge
I'm going to take

00:28:11.390 --> 00:28:14.060
you to is the edge
which we discovered

00:28:14.060 --> 00:28:15.650
at the beginning
of the 20th century

00:28:15.650 --> 00:28:18.200
that maybe actually
unknowability

00:28:18.200 --> 00:28:21.440
is actually at the heart of
the way we must do science.

00:28:21.440 --> 00:28:24.470
And this is the science
of quantum physics.

00:28:24.470 --> 00:28:27.440
So, quantum physics almost has
embedded in it the fact that

00:28:27.440 --> 00:28:28.400
you cannot know.

00:28:29.010 --> 00:28:31.880
And so, the object I took
with me on my journey

00:28:31.880 --> 00:28:35.944
to the edge of the quantum
was this pot of uranium,

00:28:35.944 --> 00:28:37.235
which I bought on the internet.

00:28:37.235 --> 00:28:38.420
[LAUGHTER]

00:28:38.420 --> 00:28:41.630
It's amazing what you can buy
on the internet these days.

00:28:41.630 --> 00:28:44.000
So, the interesting thing
about this pot of uranium

00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:46.790
is that on the side, it
tells me the activity.

00:28:46.790 --> 00:28:51.140
So, it tells me that there are
984 per minute, on average,

00:28:51.140 --> 00:28:53.735
there are 984 bits of
radiation being kicked off--

00:28:53.735 --> 00:28:55.110
oh, I probably
shouldn't do that.

00:28:55.110 --> 00:28:56.850
[LAUGHTER]

00:28:56.850 --> 00:29:00.440
There are 984 bits of
radiation being kicked off

00:29:00.440 --> 00:29:02.560
this uranium per minute.

00:29:02.560 --> 00:29:03.710
But that's on average.

00:29:03.710 --> 00:29:07.475
And what this pot can't tell
me, and in fact what physics

00:29:07.475 --> 00:29:11.600
at the moment cannot tell us,
cannot know is when it's going

00:29:11.600 --> 00:29:12.630
to do that.

00:29:12.630 --> 00:29:14.960
There is no mechanism
currently known,

00:29:14.960 --> 00:29:17.200
and it's believed that
there is no mechanism,

00:29:17.200 --> 00:29:19.490
it's a fundamental part
of the way we do physics,

00:29:19.490 --> 00:29:21.800
that there is no mechanism
which would tell me

00:29:21.800 --> 00:29:24.601
when the radiation is
going to get kicked off.

00:29:24.601 --> 00:29:25.100
OK?

00:29:25.100 --> 00:29:27.800
On average 984, but when
is it going to do it?

00:29:27.800 --> 00:29:29.126
It seems to be totally random.

00:29:29.126 --> 00:29:30.500
We don't seem to
be able to know.

00:29:30.500 --> 00:29:32.600
And this is at the
heart of something

00:29:32.600 --> 00:29:35.330
you've probably heard of,
Heisenberg's uncertainty

00:29:35.330 --> 00:29:36.110
principle.

00:29:36.110 --> 00:29:40.040
Heisenberg's uncertainty
principle kind of articulates

00:29:40.040 --> 00:29:42.870
the fact that we cannot
know certain things.

00:29:42.870 --> 00:29:44.990
So, Heisenberg's
uncertainty principle

00:29:44.990 --> 00:29:48.572
says that, for example, if I
want to know where an elec--

00:29:48.572 --> 00:29:50.030
I'm trying to
describe an electron.

00:29:50.030 --> 00:29:52.100
And if I'm trying to
do Newtonian physics,

00:29:52.100 --> 00:29:53.750
I need to know where
the electron is

00:29:53.750 --> 00:29:54.740
and how it's moving.

00:29:54.740 --> 00:29:56.320
So, I need to know
it's momentum.

00:29:56.320 --> 00:29:58.100
But Heisenberg's
uncertainty principle

00:29:58.100 --> 00:30:01.370
says, well, actually, you
can't know both of those things

00:30:01.370 --> 00:30:02.600
simultaneously.

00:30:02.600 --> 00:30:06.050
That the more you know
about where the electron is,

00:30:06.050 --> 00:30:09.667
the less you can know
about how it's moving.

00:30:09.667 --> 00:30:12.000
So, this is actually-- it's
not a wishy-washy statement.

00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:14.300
It's a very precise
mathematical formula.

00:30:14.300 --> 00:30:16.106
It actually comes out
of the mathematics.

00:30:16.106 --> 00:30:17.480
And the formula
I've written here

00:30:17.480 --> 00:30:20.270
is that the delta
x is the error.

00:30:20.270 --> 00:30:22.430
So, the error is getting
smaller and smaller.

00:30:22.430 --> 00:30:25.010
I know more and more about
where that electron is.

00:30:25.010 --> 00:30:27.542
To make this equation work,
the error in the momentum,

00:30:27.542 --> 00:30:29.000
it means that
momentum can suddenly

00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:32.575
have a whole range of
different possible values.

00:30:32.575 --> 00:30:34.450
And if I get to know--
so, you might say, oh,

00:30:34.450 --> 00:30:35.824
I know where the
electron is now.

00:30:35.824 --> 00:30:38.440
So, now, I'm going to
measure its momentum.

00:30:38.440 --> 00:30:41.820
Well, as you get to know more
about how that thing's moving,

00:30:41.820 --> 00:30:43.560
you suddenly lose
knowledge again.

00:30:43.560 --> 00:30:45.590
Suddenly, the electron
could be anywhere

00:30:45.590 --> 00:30:48.330
as the error gets
larger and larger.

00:30:48.330 --> 00:30:51.150
So, if you'll indulge me, my
favourite physics joke is about

00:30:51.150 --> 00:30:51.650
Heisenberg.

00:30:51.650 --> 00:30:56.360
So, Heisenberg is bombing
down the motorway in his BMW.

00:30:56.360 --> 00:30:58.550
And the police pull him over.

00:30:58.550 --> 00:31:01.510
The policeman gets
Heisenberg out of the car

00:31:01.510 --> 00:31:04.500
and says to him, sir, do you
know how fast you were going?

00:31:04.500 --> 00:31:05.715
[LAUGHTER]

00:31:05.715 --> 00:31:08.220
And Heisenberg says, no, but
I know exactly where I was.

00:31:08.220 --> 00:31:09.137
[LAUGHTER]

00:31:09.137 --> 00:31:10.970
Good, yeah, you're a
good audience, you see.

00:31:10.970 --> 00:31:13.800
So, anyone who's sort of sitting
there saying, why were they

00:31:13.800 --> 00:31:14.400
laughing?

00:31:14.400 --> 00:31:15.646
That wasn't funny.

00:31:15.646 --> 00:31:17.520
You shouldn't have to
explain a joke, I know.

00:31:17.520 --> 00:31:21.630
But the point is because
he knew exactly where he

00:31:21.630 --> 00:31:23.460
was, it meant that
there was an uncertainty

00:31:23.460 --> 00:31:26.220
about the different values
that his speed could have been.

00:31:26.220 --> 00:31:29.340
So, it could be in a whole
range of different values.

00:31:29.340 --> 00:31:30.990
So, here's the
follow-up to the joke.

00:31:30.990 --> 00:31:33.920
So, the police
officers says, you

00:31:33.920 --> 00:31:36.960
were going 200
kilometres per hour.

00:31:36.960 --> 00:31:38.310
And Heisenberg goes, oh!

00:31:38.310 --> 00:31:39.010
Now we're lost.

00:31:39.010 --> 00:31:40.732
[LAUGHTER]

00:31:40.732 --> 00:31:41.940
More people getting that one.

00:31:41.940 --> 00:31:42.970
Yes, exactly.

00:31:42.970 --> 00:31:46.110
So, because we now know
how fast he was going,

00:31:46.110 --> 00:31:48.737
he's lost information
about his position.

00:31:48.737 --> 00:31:50.070
There's a third bit to the joke.

00:31:50.070 --> 00:31:50.775
You can ask me in the questions.

00:31:50.775 --> 00:31:52.050
The follow-up to that one.

00:31:52.050 --> 00:31:54.750
But Schrodinger happens to
be in the back of the car.

00:31:54.750 --> 00:31:57.636
[LAUGHTER]

00:31:59.610 --> 00:32:04.410
But actually, modern physics
has a different interpretation

00:32:04.410 --> 00:32:04.930
about this.

00:32:04.930 --> 00:32:07.276
It actually says, well, maybe
it's kind of our language

00:32:07.276 --> 00:32:07.900
which is wrong.

00:32:07.900 --> 00:32:09.630
That actually this
electron doesn't

00:32:09.630 --> 00:32:12.780
have a position and a
momentum at the same time.

00:32:12.780 --> 00:32:15.240
That's a very sort of old
Newtonian classical way

00:32:15.240 --> 00:32:16.370
of thinking about it.

00:32:16.370 --> 00:32:18.750
Actually, we should think
that this thing doesn't have

00:32:18.750 --> 00:32:20.520
a position until we observe it.

00:32:20.520 --> 00:32:23.330
So, actually, we have this
thing called the quantum wave

00:32:23.330 --> 00:32:23.980
function.

00:32:23.980 --> 00:32:27.330
So, this kind of tells
you the likelihood

00:32:27.330 --> 00:32:28.770
of finding where
the electron is.

00:32:28.770 --> 00:32:29.936
But it actually isn't there.

00:32:29.936 --> 00:32:32.850
It doesn't have a
position until you make

00:32:32.850 --> 00:32:34.630
the commitment of observing it.

00:32:34.630 --> 00:32:37.776
And then it collapses into
a position, and the waves

00:32:37.776 --> 00:32:39.150
sort of-- if the
wave is high, it

00:32:39.150 --> 00:32:40.816
says you're more
likely to find it here.

00:32:40.816 --> 00:32:42.990
If it's low, it says,
no, very unlikely.

00:32:42.990 --> 00:32:45.600
But there is a chance
that you'll find it there.

00:32:45.600 --> 00:32:49.365
Now, I find this
totally unsatisfactory.

00:32:49.365 --> 00:32:52.436
It's because, you
know, my feeling is

00:32:52.436 --> 00:32:54.810
that you do an experiment, if
you set it up the same way,

00:32:54.810 --> 00:32:56.400
you're going to get the
same answer each time.

00:32:56.400 --> 00:32:58.140
This says, no, you're
just not going to know.

00:32:58.140 --> 00:32:59.598
You can set up the
same experiment,

00:32:59.598 --> 00:33:00.740
do it over and over again.

00:33:00.740 --> 00:33:02.790
And each time you
do it, the electron

00:33:02.790 --> 00:33:04.670
can do something
completely different.

00:33:04.670 --> 00:33:06.372
So, there's no determinism here.

00:33:06.372 --> 00:33:07.830
There's no mechanism
which is going

00:33:07.830 --> 00:33:09.870
to say where it's going to be.

00:33:09.870 --> 00:33:11.600
And actually, this
controls the--

00:33:11.600 --> 00:33:13.410
it's the same sort
of mechanism which

00:33:13.410 --> 00:33:17.380
is at the heart of explaining
the radiation of this uranium.

00:33:17.380 --> 00:33:20.610
So, actually, I know quite
a lot about the momentum

00:33:20.610 --> 00:33:23.460
of the bound particles
inside the nucleus

00:33:23.460 --> 00:33:26.890
of the uranium, which means I
know less about the position.

00:33:26.890 --> 00:33:29.820
The position can be on a
whole range of possibilities.

00:33:29.820 --> 00:33:31.620
And when we observe
it, sometimes

00:33:31.620 --> 00:33:34.110
that position can be-- most of
the times it's still inside.

00:33:34.110 --> 00:33:36.840
But sometimes it can be outside,
this thing called tunnelling.

00:33:36.840 --> 00:33:38.430
And then it radiates.

00:33:38.430 --> 00:33:41.500
So, this kind of
indeterminacy is actually

00:33:41.500 --> 00:33:44.610
at the heart of
explaining the radiation.

00:33:44.610 --> 00:33:48.210
But I just cannot believe
there isn't something that we

00:33:48.210 --> 00:33:50.550
haven't found yet, something
that will tell us when

00:33:50.550 --> 00:33:51.480
it's going to do that.

00:33:51.480 --> 00:33:53.730
I mean, is it genuinely
something that we cannot know?

00:33:53.730 --> 00:33:55.563
Or is it just that
physicists have given up,

00:33:55.563 --> 00:33:57.960
and it's, you know, this
theory works very well.

00:33:57.960 --> 00:34:00.930
So, why do we need to bother
because it tells us everything

00:34:00.930 --> 00:34:01.880
we need to know.

00:34:01.880 --> 00:34:03.887
And I'm not alone in
thinking that surely this

00:34:03.887 --> 00:34:05.970
is actually not genuinely
something we don't know.

00:34:05.970 --> 00:34:08.300
It's just that we haven't
had the revolution which

00:34:08.300 --> 00:34:09.820
would give us the mechanism.

00:34:09.820 --> 00:34:13.290
And Einstein was certainly
a believer in this

00:34:13.290 --> 00:34:15.389
being not the final answer.

00:34:15.389 --> 00:34:19.530
He wrote very famously, "Quantum
mechanics is very impressive.

00:34:19.530 --> 00:34:23.100
But an inner voice tells me that
it is not yet the real thing.

00:34:23.100 --> 00:34:25.560
The theory produces a
good deal, but it hardly

00:34:25.560 --> 00:34:27.989
brings us closer to the
secret of the old one.

00:34:27.989 --> 00:34:31.571
I am at all events convinced
that he does not play dice."

00:34:31.571 --> 00:34:33.570
And it is certainly true
that theory is probably

00:34:33.570 --> 00:34:35.730
one of the most well
tested theories that we

00:34:35.730 --> 00:34:37.790
have on the scientific books.

00:34:37.790 --> 00:34:40.199
You know, to use this
theory of probability

00:34:40.199 --> 00:34:42.500
and quantum physics
is good enough

00:34:42.500 --> 00:34:44.790
for nearly everything
you want to do.

00:34:44.790 --> 00:34:46.380
But surely there's
something going

00:34:46.380 --> 00:34:49.260
on inside this uranium,
which is controlling

00:34:49.260 --> 00:34:50.550
when it's going to radiate.

00:34:50.550 --> 00:34:54.810
We now know, of course, that
this mechanism, if it exists,

00:34:54.810 --> 00:34:56.429
is a very weird one.

00:34:56.429 --> 00:35:00.210
The idea of entanglement has
made us understand that it

00:35:00.210 --> 00:35:02.670
won't be kind of localised
inside the uranium.

00:35:02.670 --> 00:35:04.500
It will be something
which actually

00:35:04.500 --> 00:35:07.150
spans the whole universe
which is controlling

00:35:07.150 --> 00:35:10.400
the decision about when this
is going to radiate or not.

00:35:10.400 --> 00:35:11.642
But is there a mechanism?

00:35:11.642 --> 00:35:14.100
Maybe there isn't, and maybe
this is genuinely something we

00:35:14.100 --> 00:35:16.410
cannot know.

00:35:16.410 --> 00:35:19.140
Now, I said that I was
going to kind of tease out

00:35:19.140 --> 00:35:24.420
a little bit of implications
of the unknown for the idea

00:35:24.420 --> 00:35:25.770
of religion and god.

00:35:25.770 --> 00:35:27.690
And so, I was quite
interested to talk

00:35:27.690 --> 00:35:31.620
to some scientists who
are actually religious

00:35:31.620 --> 00:35:33.450
and see what their belief--

00:35:33.450 --> 00:35:35.060
how did they marry
up their ideas

00:35:35.060 --> 00:35:37.230
of doing science and religion.

00:35:37.230 --> 00:35:38.940
And the person I
took on my journey

00:35:38.940 --> 00:35:41.580
to the edge of the
quantum world is actually

00:35:41.580 --> 00:35:43.470
an interesting scientist.

00:35:43.470 --> 00:35:45.000
It's John Polkinghorne.

00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:47.160
John Polkinghorne,
a quantum physicist,

00:35:47.160 --> 00:35:49.790
trained with the best,
trained with Feynman, Dirac.

00:35:49.790 --> 00:35:52.189
Can't ask for better
teachers than those two.

00:35:52.189 --> 00:35:53.730
But then half way
through his career,

00:35:53.730 --> 00:35:55.350
he decided he wanted
to be ordained

00:35:55.350 --> 00:35:58.051
as a priest in the
Church of England.

00:35:58.051 --> 00:35:59.550
He kind of refers
to himself as kind

00:35:59.550 --> 00:36:01.290
of like a vegetarian butcher.

00:36:01.290 --> 00:36:03.540
[LAUGHTER]

00:36:03.540 --> 00:36:06.200
But I was kind of interested
because, you know, for me,

00:36:06.200 --> 00:36:08.730
it actually was quite remarkable
how many of the scientists

00:36:08.730 --> 00:36:11.300
I talked to had some
sort of religious belief.

00:36:11.300 --> 00:36:14.880
But I think there are two
sort of religious scientists.

00:36:14.880 --> 00:36:18.010
There are the deists
and the theists.

00:36:18.010 --> 00:36:21.120
The deists are those
who say, for example,

00:36:21.120 --> 00:36:23.430
one of the big unknowns is,
where did all of this stuff

00:36:23.430 --> 00:36:24.920
come from?

00:36:24.920 --> 00:36:27.040
What created all
of this, you know,

00:36:27.040 --> 00:36:29.340
this table, this
dice, the pendulum?

00:36:29.340 --> 00:36:30.770
Where did it all come from?

00:36:30.770 --> 00:36:34.470
And many scientists-- we just
do not know the answer to that.

00:36:34.470 --> 00:36:36.300
We don't know the
answer to that.

00:36:36.300 --> 00:36:39.130
And some people will call the
answer to that, that unknown--

00:36:39.130 --> 00:36:40.410
look, I don't know the answer.

00:36:40.410 --> 00:36:42.887
I'm just going to call that
the god which created it.

00:36:42.887 --> 00:36:44.970
And we might find out more
about what that god is.

00:36:44.970 --> 00:36:47.010
But that's what I'm calling god.

00:36:47.010 --> 00:36:48.960
And now I'm a scientist,
and I do my science.

00:36:48.960 --> 00:36:50.876
And I don't think this
thing acts in the world

00:36:50.876 --> 00:36:52.590
and changes it.

00:36:52.590 --> 00:36:54.729
So, those are the deists.

00:36:54.729 --> 00:36:57.020
And I think probably Einstein,
when he talks about god,

00:36:57.020 --> 00:37:01.126
is thinking more about that
kind of idea of the unknown.

00:37:01.126 --> 00:37:03.000
But Polkinghorne is
slightly more interesting

00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:04.530
because he's a theist.

00:37:04.530 --> 00:37:07.920
These are people who believe
that their god actually acts

00:37:07.920 --> 00:37:10.510
in the world and transforms
it and changes it

00:37:10.510 --> 00:37:13.410
and that maybe you can actually
help influence this god

00:37:13.410 --> 00:37:14.660
to change the world.

00:37:14.660 --> 00:37:16.410
So, I was interested
to talk to him about,

00:37:16.410 --> 00:37:17.730
well, OK, you're a scientist.

00:37:17.730 --> 00:37:20.610
How is your science
actually working

00:37:20.610 --> 00:37:23.520
to actually have some sort
of action in the world?

00:37:23.520 --> 00:37:25.680
And I wondered, as
a quantum physicist,

00:37:25.680 --> 00:37:29.070
whether he might see that sort
of unknown of quantum physics

00:37:29.070 --> 00:37:32.340
as a window of opportunity
for an external force

00:37:32.340 --> 00:37:33.810
to actually make some action.

00:37:33.810 --> 00:37:35.910
Because if actually
within the system

00:37:35.910 --> 00:37:39.280
we can never know where the
electron is going to be,

00:37:39.280 --> 00:37:42.330
then maybe that's an
opportunity for something

00:37:42.330 --> 00:37:44.371
external to be
going, OK, well, now

00:37:44.371 --> 00:37:45.870
I'm going to put
the electron there.

00:37:45.870 --> 00:37:48.600
Because chaos theory actually
means that a very small change

00:37:48.600 --> 00:37:50.060
can have a big outcome.

00:37:50.060 --> 00:37:51.870
Maybe actually, where
the electron will go

00:37:51.870 --> 00:37:55.200
can cause quite a big
effect on the outcome.

00:37:55.200 --> 00:37:57.960
But Polkinghorne didn't
go for quantum physics.

00:37:57.960 --> 00:38:00.930
He said, well, no, that
still depends on an observer.

00:38:00.930 --> 00:38:04.230
You have to observe the setting
in order for the wave function

00:38:04.230 --> 00:38:05.640
to collapse.

00:38:05.640 --> 00:38:07.380
And he didn't believe
that sort of god

00:38:07.380 --> 00:38:09.390
would be waiting for--
his god would be waiting

00:38:09.390 --> 00:38:11.130
for observations to happen.

00:38:11.130 --> 00:38:13.240
And he actually
chose chaos theory

00:38:13.240 --> 00:38:15.570
as his little kind of
window of the unknown

00:38:15.570 --> 00:38:17.220
for his god to act in the world.

00:38:17.220 --> 00:38:18.840
So, he believes
that as humans we

00:38:18.840 --> 00:38:21.810
can never know how a system
is completely set up.

00:38:21.810 --> 00:38:24.160
So, there will always
kind of be decimal places

00:38:24.160 --> 00:38:26.400
which are unknown
where you can actually

00:38:26.400 --> 00:38:28.350
start to tinker with
things and actually

00:38:28.350 --> 00:38:29.670
have an effect on the system.

00:38:29.670 --> 00:38:31.980
And you don't have
to affect things

00:38:31.980 --> 00:38:33.630
like conservation of energy.

00:38:33.630 --> 00:38:36.630
That it's still possible to move
the system, conserve energy.

00:38:36.630 --> 00:38:39.360
And he believed that that
might be a place for his god

00:38:39.360 --> 00:38:40.360
to act in the world.

00:38:40.360 --> 00:38:42.840
Interestingly, this
is not a new idea.

00:38:42.840 --> 00:38:46.350
Newton himself, also a
very religious scientist,

00:38:46.350 --> 00:38:49.260
also believed that it
was in the decimals

00:38:49.260 --> 00:38:52.810
that his god could actually
change and affect the world.

00:38:52.810 --> 00:38:54.441
And he had a big
fight with Leibniz--

00:38:54.441 --> 00:38:56.940
he had many fights with Leibniz
over the calculus and things

00:38:56.940 --> 00:38:57.540
like that.

00:38:57.540 --> 00:38:59.956
But one of his fights, Leibniz
said, well, I don't get it.

00:38:59.956 --> 00:39:01.620
Why wouldn't God have
set up the system

00:39:01.620 --> 00:39:03.660
to be sort of perfect
in the first go?

00:39:03.660 --> 00:39:05.700
I mean, why does he
need to interact-- or he

00:39:05.700 --> 00:39:08.202
or she or it need to
interact with the thing?

00:39:08.202 --> 00:39:10.410
So, it's interesting that
it's not a kind of new idea

00:39:10.410 --> 00:39:15.242
to use the ideas of those small
changes can have big effects.

00:39:15.242 --> 00:39:16.950
But for me, one of
the interesting things

00:39:16.950 --> 00:39:19.500
is that quantum physics
actually might give us

00:39:19.500 --> 00:39:22.020
an answer to one of
those big unknowns, which

00:39:22.020 --> 00:39:23.760
I think is responsible
for many people

00:39:23.760 --> 00:39:27.240
being religious, which is well,
where did all of this stuff

00:39:27.240 --> 00:39:27.884
come from?

00:39:27.884 --> 00:39:29.550
I mean, for example,
my port of uranium,

00:39:29.550 --> 00:39:30.591
where did that come from?

00:39:30.591 --> 00:39:32.540
Well, I bought it
on Amazon, actually.

00:39:32.540 --> 00:39:33.359
[LAUGHTER]

00:39:33.359 --> 00:39:34.150
And it was amazing.

00:39:34.150 --> 00:39:36.340
You know you can write
reviews underneath.

00:39:36.340 --> 00:39:38.454
So, some of the
reviews are amazing.

00:39:38.454 --> 00:39:40.995
One guy said, so glad I don't
have to buy this from Libyans--

00:39:40.995 --> 00:39:41.610
[LAUGHTER]

00:39:41.610 --> 00:39:44.907
--in parking lots
at the mall anymore.

00:39:44.907 --> 00:39:46.740
There was one who was
complaining that said,

00:39:46.740 --> 00:39:49.890
I've had this for 4 billion
years, and it's half full.

00:39:49.890 --> 00:39:51.306
[LAUGHTER]

00:39:51.306 --> 00:39:55.900
I see-- I love when you
get the half-life jokes.

00:39:55.900 --> 00:39:57.890
But no, where did
this come from?

00:39:57.890 --> 00:39:59.959
OK, well, it came from
a mine, ultimately.

00:39:59.959 --> 00:40:01.250
Somebody dug it up from a mine.

00:40:01.250 --> 00:40:01.750
But OK.

00:40:01.750 --> 00:40:04.410
But where did the uranium
come from in the mine?

00:40:04.410 --> 00:40:05.940
Well, we now know
that that uranium

00:40:05.940 --> 00:40:08.520
had to be created inside
a supernova crushing

00:40:08.520 --> 00:40:10.950
all of these particles
together to fuse them

00:40:10.950 --> 00:40:13.140
into this very heavy atom.

00:40:13.140 --> 00:40:14.940
But then, where did
all of those electrons

00:40:14.940 --> 00:40:18.360
and the protons and the neutrons
come, which slam together?

00:40:18.360 --> 00:40:19.860
Well, you know, if
you work it back,

00:40:19.860 --> 00:40:21.060
then you're back
to the Big Bang.

00:40:21.060 --> 00:40:22.643
And you're like,
well, yeah, so, where

00:40:22.643 --> 00:40:25.500
did all of these
particles come from?

00:40:25.500 --> 00:40:28.370
Well, it's possible that quantum
physics might have an answer.

00:40:28.370 --> 00:40:30.840
Because Heisenberg's
uncertainty principle

00:40:30.840 --> 00:40:32.790
applies to different
sorts of measurements.

00:40:32.790 --> 00:40:35.885
I told you the one about
position and momentum.

00:40:35.885 --> 00:40:38.010
But there are other things
which are bound together

00:40:38.010 --> 00:40:39.840
in a kind of
uncertainty principle.

00:40:39.840 --> 00:40:42.240
And the other two that are
interesting in this case

00:40:42.240 --> 00:40:44.620
are energy and time.

00:40:44.620 --> 00:40:47.790
So, it means,
actually, that it's not

00:40:47.790 --> 00:40:49.860
possible to have a true vacuum.

00:40:49.860 --> 00:40:53.400
Because remember energy
e equals mc squared.

00:40:53.400 --> 00:40:56.100
So, energy is actually
equivalent to mass.

00:40:56.100 --> 00:40:59.160
So, if you actually
narrow the window of time,

00:40:59.160 --> 00:41:01.560
it means there's an uncertainty
in the energy because

00:41:01.560 --> 00:41:03.120
of this uncertainty principle.

00:41:03.120 --> 00:41:05.870
So, it means that you can never
have a region of space which

00:41:05.870 --> 00:41:07.160
is truly a vacuum.

00:41:07.160 --> 00:41:10.450
Because in each very
small window of time,

00:41:10.450 --> 00:41:12.620
that can't be set
to zero, the energy,

00:41:12.620 --> 00:41:14.850
because there has to be
an uncertainty there.

00:41:14.850 --> 00:41:17.690
So, sometimes the energy can
have a positive value, which

00:41:17.690 --> 00:41:19.632
can give rise to particles.

00:41:19.632 --> 00:41:21.840
So, it's a little bit like
thinking of the equation 0

00:41:21.840 --> 00:41:24.710
equals 1 plus, minus 1.

00:41:24.710 --> 00:41:27.410
So, 0 sort of suddenly
turns into a particle

00:41:27.410 --> 00:41:29.930
and an antiparticle, which
very often just annihilate

00:41:29.930 --> 00:41:31.970
each other, and it goes
back to the zero state.

00:41:31.970 --> 00:41:33.344
But sometimes
those can separate,

00:41:33.344 --> 00:41:36.030
and so you can get
something out of nothing.

00:41:36.030 --> 00:41:39.980
Actually, this is at the
heart of Hawking's discovery

00:41:39.980 --> 00:41:42.470
of radiation from a black hole.

00:41:42.470 --> 00:41:45.200
That actually on the event
horizon of a black hole,

00:41:45.200 --> 00:41:48.020
you can get these quantum
fluctuations happening such

00:41:48.020 --> 00:41:50.569
that a particle forms on one
side and an anti-particle

00:41:50.569 --> 00:41:51.110
on the other.

00:41:51.110 --> 00:41:52.880
And then they can't
actually get to each other.

00:41:52.880 --> 00:41:54.390
Particle emits,
the anti-particle

00:41:54.390 --> 00:41:56.599
starts to degrade
the black hole.

00:41:56.599 --> 00:41:58.640
And it's a way that black
holes can actually sort

00:41:58.640 --> 00:42:01.340
of start to sort of seep away.

00:42:01.340 --> 00:42:02.990
The rate is so small
that at the moment

00:42:02.990 --> 00:42:05.510
we haven't observed it, which
is why he hasn't won the Nobel

00:42:05.510 --> 00:42:06.020
Prize yet.

00:42:06.020 --> 00:42:08.690
But once there's an
observation made of it,

00:42:08.690 --> 00:42:10.412
that will probably follow.

00:42:10.412 --> 00:42:12.620
So, it's the same principle
about why black holes are

00:42:12.620 --> 00:42:15.060
actually radiating.

00:42:15.060 --> 00:42:19.130
So, you know, actually, if
you think about it, OK, still,

00:42:19.130 --> 00:42:20.540
empty space isn't nothing.

00:42:20.540 --> 00:42:21.950
That isn't really nothing.

00:42:21.950 --> 00:42:23.536
Where did the empty
space come from?

00:42:23.536 --> 00:42:25.160
It's a three-dimensional
space or maybe

00:42:25.160 --> 00:42:27.380
an 11-dimensional space.

00:42:27.380 --> 00:42:28.730
So, where did that come from?

00:42:28.730 --> 00:42:30.830
You've still got to answer that.

00:42:30.830 --> 00:42:33.170
OK, once you've got space,
it might have fluctuations

00:42:33.170 --> 00:42:36.010
which give rise to particles.

00:42:36.010 --> 00:42:38.750
But now, sort of ideas
of quantum gravity

00:42:38.750 --> 00:42:41.300
are beginning to give
us even the possibility

00:42:41.300 --> 00:42:43.220
that fluctuations
in quantum gravity

00:42:43.220 --> 00:42:46.280
can give us space out
of genuinely nothing.

00:42:46.280 --> 00:42:49.100
So, it's interesting that
quantum physics might be a way

00:42:49.100 --> 00:42:51.290
to answer one of the
really big unknowns, which

00:42:51.290 --> 00:42:55.430
causes a lot of people, I think,
to have to create a creator.

00:42:55.430 --> 00:42:57.560
So, that was a
little exploration

00:42:57.560 --> 00:43:00.600
into the edges of the
unknown of quantum physics.

00:43:00.600 --> 00:43:03.312
So, I'll give you a
little whizzy guided tour.

00:43:03.312 --> 00:43:04.020
How are we doing?

00:43:04.020 --> 00:43:04.940
We've got 10 minutes left.

00:43:04.940 --> 00:43:05.480
Good, OK.

00:43:05.480 --> 00:43:07.800
So, we've got to do five
great unknowns in 10 minutes.

00:43:07.800 --> 00:43:08.300
[LAUGHTER]

00:43:08.300 --> 00:43:09.620
Oh, my god.

00:43:09.620 --> 00:43:12.154
Wow, I set myself a challenge.

00:43:12.154 --> 00:43:13.820
So, one of the things
I was intrigued in

00:43:13.820 --> 00:43:16.370
is, OK, what is the
uranium made out of.

00:43:16.370 --> 00:43:20.840
Because uranium-- OK, so, I've
mentioned electrons, protons,

00:43:20.840 --> 00:43:21.960
and neutrons.

00:43:21.960 --> 00:43:25.520
So, but actually, the electrons
we believe are indivisible.

00:43:25.520 --> 00:43:27.390
But what about the
protons and neutrons?

00:43:27.390 --> 00:43:28.806
You know, at one
point, we thought

00:43:28.806 --> 00:43:30.860
atoms were kind of invisible.

00:43:30.860 --> 00:43:33.290
Then they pulled apart into
these electrons, protons,

00:43:33.290 --> 00:43:33.926
and neutrons.

00:43:33.926 --> 00:43:35.300
And then the
protons and neutrons

00:43:35.300 --> 00:43:37.110
we discovered are
not indivisible.

00:43:37.110 --> 00:43:39.320
They've pulled apart,
and we now know

00:43:39.320 --> 00:43:41.840
there are quarks at
the heart of those.

00:43:41.840 --> 00:43:45.320
And that, we think,
is the invisible bits

00:43:45.320 --> 00:43:47.110
which build all of matter.

00:43:47.110 --> 00:43:48.420
But that's our generation.

00:43:48.420 --> 00:43:50.120
And as my book sort
of illustrates,

00:43:50.120 --> 00:43:52.250
I go through the
history of science,

00:43:52.250 --> 00:43:53.990
and we just see
each new generation

00:43:53.990 --> 00:43:56.740
has a different story
about the next layer down.

00:43:56.740 --> 00:44:01.019
So, how can I ever know actually
that I've hit the last layer?

00:44:01.019 --> 00:44:02.810
How do I know that
there won't be another--

00:44:02.810 --> 00:44:04.680
the quarks will come
apart into something else,

00:44:04.680 --> 00:44:06.200
and those will come apart
into something else.

00:44:06.200 --> 00:44:08.610
So, can I ever know that
I've hit the last layer?

00:44:08.610 --> 00:44:10.130
Is that actually an unknown?

00:44:10.130 --> 00:44:13.027
Because maybe it's
turtles, all the way down.

00:44:13.027 --> 00:44:13.610
You know, so--

00:44:13.610 --> 00:44:14.300
[LAUGHTER]

00:44:14.300 --> 00:44:16.700
So, the unknown are the very
small and also the very big.

00:44:16.700 --> 00:44:18.920
What about the universe?

00:44:18.920 --> 00:44:20.420
Is the universe infinite?

00:44:20.420 --> 00:44:25.516
If it is, is that something
we could ever know?

00:44:25.516 --> 00:44:27.410
We can explore the universe.

00:44:27.410 --> 00:44:29.630
But actually,
Einstein has given us

00:44:29.630 --> 00:44:31.610
a kind of limit on
what we can actually

00:44:31.610 --> 00:44:33.950
see about our universe.

00:44:33.950 --> 00:44:36.270
So, let me take it into here.

00:44:36.270 --> 00:44:41.750
There's a kind of cosmic horizon
surrounding us beyond which we

00:44:41.750 --> 00:44:43.100
cannot actually know anything.

00:44:43.100 --> 00:44:46.880
Because information travels
at the speed of light.

00:44:46.880 --> 00:44:49.790
The universe has been going
for 13.8 billion years.

00:44:49.790 --> 00:44:52.790
That means actually, we can only
have received a finite amount

00:44:52.790 --> 00:44:55.310
of information coming into us.

00:44:55.310 --> 00:44:57.434
That bubble beyond
that, no information

00:44:57.434 --> 00:44:58.350
could have reached us.

00:44:58.350 --> 00:45:01.940
So, we can't know anything
about beyond that bubble.

00:45:01.940 --> 00:45:03.210
Now, that bubble is growing.

00:45:03.210 --> 00:45:04.834
So, we're sort of
seeing more and more.

00:45:04.834 --> 00:45:06.530
But we'll only ever
see a finite bit.

00:45:06.530 --> 00:45:09.300
So, how can we ever
know it's infinite?

00:45:09.300 --> 00:45:10.490
But not only that.

00:45:10.490 --> 00:45:14.450
It turns out the universe is
accelerating in its expansion.

00:45:14.450 --> 00:45:17.460
It's actually pushing things
over our cosmic horizons.

00:45:17.460 --> 00:45:19.820
So, as time goes on, we
are actually seeing less.

00:45:19.820 --> 00:45:22.430
We're going to get to a point
where actually all the galaxies

00:45:22.430 --> 00:45:23.697
are pushed over the horizon.

00:45:23.697 --> 00:45:25.280
We'll come back to
a very ancient kind

00:45:25.280 --> 00:45:27.200
of view of our universe
that we are just

00:45:27.200 --> 00:45:29.289
one galaxy in a massive void.

00:45:29.289 --> 00:45:30.830
So, I think that's
quite a challenge.

00:45:30.830 --> 00:45:36.560
Could we ever know that the
universe is infinite, if it is?

00:45:36.560 --> 00:45:38.810
So, that was the very big.

00:45:38.810 --> 00:45:41.000
I think one of the other
great unknowns is time.

00:45:41.000 --> 00:45:43.570
The question of what
happened before the Big Bang.

00:45:43.570 --> 00:45:44.570
Could we ever know that?

00:45:44.570 --> 00:45:45.500
It's a singularity.

00:45:45.500 --> 00:45:46.580
We can't know.

00:45:46.580 --> 00:45:50.240
The math denies us access
to time before the Big Bang.

00:45:50.240 --> 00:45:52.580
Will time go on forever,
or does it have an end?

00:45:52.580 --> 00:45:56.930
It turns out, it seems like
time is actually finite.

00:45:56.930 --> 00:45:58.610
Now, I used to--

00:45:58.610 --> 00:46:00.500
I grew up with the
belief that you can't

00:46:00.500 --> 00:46:02.090
ask what's before the Big Bang.

00:46:02.090 --> 00:46:04.730
But there are a kind of rumbles
in the cosmological corridors

00:46:04.730 --> 00:46:07.270
that actually, maybe
we can answer that one.

00:46:07.270 --> 00:46:10.030
We can talk about what
happened before the Big Bang.

00:46:10.030 --> 00:46:13.840
So, time is still one
of the big mysteries.

00:46:13.840 --> 00:46:15.370
Actually, the last
edge I talk about

00:46:15.370 --> 00:46:18.190
is my own area of mathematics,
which was actually partly

00:46:18.190 --> 00:46:19.960
an inspiration for
this whole book.

00:46:19.960 --> 00:46:21.400
Because in my area
of mathematics,

00:46:21.400 --> 00:46:25.540
we actually have a proof of
the limitations of our tools.

00:46:25.540 --> 00:46:27.880
It's something called Godel's
incompleteness theorem,

00:46:27.880 --> 00:46:31.840
which says that there are true
statements about mathematics

00:46:31.840 --> 00:46:34.360
which you cannot prove are
true within your system

00:46:34.360 --> 00:46:35.359
of mathematics.

00:46:35.359 --> 00:46:37.900
So, actually, we've been able
to prove there are things which

00:46:37.900 --> 00:46:39.790
are true which we
cannot prove are true.

00:46:39.790 --> 00:46:40.960
[LAUGHTER]

00:46:40.960 --> 00:46:42.620
Which is amazing.

00:46:42.620 --> 00:46:44.690
So, that was partly
my inspiration.

00:46:44.690 --> 00:46:46.324
But I think the
penultimate edge--

00:46:46.324 --> 00:46:48.490
well, I've got five minutes
to tell you about this--

00:46:48.490 --> 00:46:50.240
which I think is a
really interesting one.

00:46:50.240 --> 00:46:52.570
Because it goes to the
heart of who we are.

00:46:52.570 --> 00:46:56.810
And this is the question of the
hard problem of consciousness.

00:46:56.810 --> 00:46:59.920
What is it that makes us
have a sense of ourselves

00:46:59.920 --> 00:47:01.060
inside our bodies?

00:47:01.060 --> 00:47:03.060
Is that something
we can ever know?

00:47:03.060 --> 00:47:05.062
And actually, the
object I took--

00:47:05.062 --> 00:47:06.520
I mean, I think
the real challenge,

00:47:06.520 --> 00:47:08.350
Wittgenstein kind
of summed it up.

00:47:08.350 --> 00:47:10.225
Consciousness is a
little bit like--

00:47:10.225 --> 00:47:11.890
we've all got this box.

00:47:11.890 --> 00:47:13.720
And inside it,
there is something

00:47:13.720 --> 00:47:15.490
we've all called a beetle.

00:47:15.490 --> 00:47:17.652
But nobody can look
in anybody else's box.

00:47:17.652 --> 00:47:19.360
And so, we don't know
whether your beetle

00:47:19.360 --> 00:47:21.162
is anything like my beetle.

00:47:21.162 --> 00:47:22.370
And this is a real challenge.

00:47:22.370 --> 00:47:25.315
You know, you're all
conscious, I hope.

00:47:25.315 --> 00:47:27.775
I mean, some of you are looking
a little bit dazed by now--

00:47:27.775 --> 00:47:28.971
oh, it's quite late.

00:47:28.971 --> 00:47:29.470
[LAUGHTER]

00:47:29.470 --> 00:47:31.510
But you know, I assume
you're all conscious.

00:47:31.510 --> 00:47:33.289
This kind of idea
of homogeneity.

00:47:33.289 --> 00:47:34.330
You're all quite like me.

00:47:34.330 --> 00:47:36.410
So, I assume your consciousness
is quite like my own.

00:47:36.410 --> 00:47:37.900
But how can I
actually know that?

00:47:37.900 --> 00:47:40.191
How can I actually be sure
that tonight you haven't all

00:47:40.191 --> 00:47:42.610
sent your avatars
along to this lecture

00:47:42.610 --> 00:47:44.950
and in fact you're all at
home sort of catching up

00:47:44.950 --> 00:47:47.242
on Poldark or something.

00:47:47.242 --> 00:47:48.700
In fact there isn't
any-- you know,

00:47:48.700 --> 00:47:51.340
doing a very good impression
of a conscious being.

00:47:51.340 --> 00:47:54.400
But how can I actually know
that there's anything going on.

00:47:54.400 --> 00:47:59.110
And I think this is the
real challenge, you know,

00:47:59.110 --> 00:48:01.802
of actually
understanding firstly,

00:48:01.802 --> 00:48:03.760
what it is-- what is it
about putting electrons

00:48:03.760 --> 00:48:05.560
and protons and
neutrons together which

00:48:05.560 --> 00:48:07.126
gives a sense of self?

00:48:07.126 --> 00:48:08.500
And secondly, how
can I ever know

00:48:08.500 --> 00:48:09.750
that somebody else has that?

00:48:09.750 --> 00:48:11.875
As I said, I think you're
all fairly similar to me.

00:48:11.875 --> 00:48:13.330
But what about my iPhone?

00:48:13.330 --> 00:48:15.730
I mean, where is my iPhone?

00:48:15.730 --> 00:48:18.490
So, actually, the object I
took with me on my journey

00:48:18.490 --> 00:48:22.090
to the edge of
consciousness was an app

00:48:22.090 --> 00:48:23.860
that I downloaded on my iPhone.

00:48:23.860 --> 00:48:27.000
And what it does,
it's a chat bot app.

00:48:27.000 --> 00:48:29.530
So, I talk to it, and
it talks back to me.

00:48:29.530 --> 00:48:32.530
And it kind of
tries to be human.

00:48:32.530 --> 00:48:34.450
It's trying to pass
the Turing test.

00:48:34.450 --> 00:48:35.117
And maybe it is.

00:48:35.117 --> 00:48:37.616
Maybe there's somebody on the
other end of the line actually

00:48:37.616 --> 00:48:38.660
typing these things in.

00:48:38.660 --> 00:48:40.034
And that's the
kind of challenge.

00:48:40.034 --> 00:48:42.770
How can I know whether
that's conscious or not?

00:48:42.770 --> 00:48:45.914
Remember the granny who always
put very polite words in Google

00:48:45.914 --> 00:48:47.830
because she assumed that
somebody was actually

00:48:47.830 --> 00:48:48.913
answering these questions?

00:48:48.913 --> 00:48:51.580
Please could you tell me the--

00:48:51.580 --> 00:48:53.980
But I think the real
challenge of consciousness

00:48:53.980 --> 00:48:56.950
and the challenge at
the heart of this edge

00:48:56.950 --> 00:48:59.170
is actually, well,
how could I ever know

00:48:59.170 --> 00:49:01.960
that this has become conscious?

00:49:01.960 --> 00:49:04.720
How can I know that the
activity inside this

00:49:04.720 --> 00:49:06.610
actually got a sense of self?

00:49:06.610 --> 00:49:08.200
You know, how--
suddenly, it declares,

00:49:08.200 --> 00:49:10.370
iPhone think,
therefore iPhone am.

00:49:10.370 --> 00:49:12.010
[LAUGHTER]

00:49:12.010 --> 00:49:12.600
Oh, my gosh.

00:49:12.600 --> 00:49:15.890
Wow, you know, I'd better
not switch it off tonight.

00:49:15.890 --> 00:49:19.360
So, I think that the
challenge of consciousness

00:49:19.360 --> 00:49:22.150
is potentially one which,
by its very nature,

00:49:22.150 --> 00:49:23.110
maybe is protected.

00:49:23.110 --> 00:49:26.890
Because I can't ever feel
what it's like to be you.

00:49:26.890 --> 00:49:28.940
We will call this a red dice.

00:49:28.940 --> 00:49:31.620
But is your sense of
red anything like mine?

00:49:31.620 --> 00:49:35.050
Pain, if you stub your toe, is
that pain anything like mine?

00:49:35.050 --> 00:49:37.750
How can we actually quantify
what it feels like to be you?

00:49:37.750 --> 00:49:40.900
We certainly got to a very
exciting stage where, you know,

00:49:40.900 --> 00:49:43.510
it's a bit like being
Galileo with a telescope.

00:49:43.510 --> 00:49:45.880
Suddenly, the universe
has opened up to him.

00:49:45.880 --> 00:49:47.760
We do have telescopes
into the mind.

00:49:47.760 --> 00:49:50.670
We can actually see the
activity of the mind at work

00:49:50.670 --> 00:49:51.820
and when it's asleep.

00:49:51.820 --> 00:49:55.060
And those tools have given
us many things that we can

00:49:55.060 --> 00:49:56.481
tease out about consciousness.

00:49:56.481 --> 00:49:58.480
And it's interesting you
mentioned Francis Crick

00:49:58.480 --> 00:50:01.554
because Francis Crick,
after doing DNA--

00:50:01.554 --> 00:50:03.220
consciousness was
something no scientist

00:50:03.220 --> 00:50:04.030
would go anywhere near.

00:50:04.030 --> 00:50:06.280
It was regarded as something
that you couldn't know.

00:50:06.280 --> 00:50:08.020
It was the domain
of the philosophers

00:50:08.020 --> 00:50:09.490
and the theologians.

00:50:09.490 --> 00:50:11.740
But Francis Crick said,
no, actually, maybe we

00:50:11.740 --> 00:50:14.010
can know much more about this.

00:50:14.010 --> 00:50:16.480
And the person I
took on my journey

00:50:16.480 --> 00:50:19.210
to the edge of consciousness
was actually this guy here,

00:50:19.210 --> 00:50:21.610
Christof Koch, who
worked with Francis Crick

00:50:21.610 --> 00:50:24.650
right at the beginning of
his work on consciousness

00:50:24.650 --> 00:50:27.064
when it was a very
untrendy thing to do.

00:50:27.064 --> 00:50:28.480
But the kind of
insights we've got

00:50:28.480 --> 00:50:30.790
are beginning to give
us some sort of idea

00:50:30.790 --> 00:50:33.490
of what it is about the
network in the brain which

00:50:33.490 --> 00:50:37.630
might actually answer the
question of consciousness.

00:50:37.630 --> 00:50:40.510
But actually, so, I've met
Christof many times in America.

00:50:40.510 --> 00:50:42.850
I've had him over to
Oxford to give talks.

00:50:42.850 --> 00:50:45.354
But my last
interaction with him,

00:50:45.354 --> 00:50:47.770
we had a Skype call together
where I kind of really pushed

00:50:47.770 --> 00:50:48.270
him.

00:50:48.270 --> 00:50:51.250
OK, you might know all of these
correlates of consciousness.

00:50:51.250 --> 00:50:54.240
But can you ever really know
that something is conscious?

00:50:54.240 --> 00:50:56.140
And maybe that is
an unanswerable.

00:50:56.140 --> 00:50:57.550
And he got very angry with me.

00:50:57.550 --> 00:50:59.840
And he kind of shouted
down the Skype call-- well,

00:50:59.840 --> 00:51:00.673
I assume it was him.

00:51:00.673 --> 00:51:03.662
Maybe it was an avatar that
he uses too, But he said,

00:51:03.662 --> 00:51:05.620
"What sort of research
programme is it, Marcus,

00:51:05.620 --> 00:51:08.200
where you throw up your hands
and say, forget about it.

00:51:08.200 --> 00:51:10.180
I can't understand it
ever, it's hopeless.

00:51:10.180 --> 00:51:11.800
That's defeatism."

00:51:11.800 --> 00:51:14.350
And I think actually, it's
the mindset of the scientist,

00:51:14.350 --> 00:51:17.560
and it's an important mindset,
that we go into every challenge

00:51:17.560 --> 00:51:21.550
actually thinking there
is nothing we cannot know.

00:51:21.550 --> 00:51:22.377
Thank you.

00:51:22.377 --> 00:51:26.113
[APPLAUSE]

00:51:26.113 --> 00:51:31.800
You have a distinction between
something that doesn't exist

00:51:31.800 --> 00:51:34.220
and something we don't know.
