[Offscreen voice]
Games can be a lot of fun can't they?

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:13.540
[Offscreen voice]
There's good sportsmanship. Do you know what that means?

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:18.540
Five years ago I began training in martial arts after 
having been a dancer for decades.

00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:23.460
What started out as a sideline interest spiraled rapidly
into an obsession.

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:29.300
Sparring in particular captured my imagination. I was 
fascinated by the way this physical, aggressive,

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:35.190
competitive practice could yield such an
extraordinary sense of community.

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:39.030
My explanation is that sparring allows us
to manage competing positions with

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:44.219
respect. If I'm trying to punch you and
you're trying to kick me in the head we

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:48.800
disagree on a pretty basic level. 
[Offscreen voice] Good sportsmanship

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:52.680
But we agree as to the terms of our interaction. 
[Offscreen voice] Play fair

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:57.837
At the end we shake hands and most of the
time we actually mean it.

00:00:57.837 --> 00:01:01.280
This is an interesting metaphor for social reality.

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:04.340
Political theorist Chantal Mouffe says that

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:10.340
pluralistic democracy hinges not on
unity but on dissent. She maintains that

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:14.160
we can practice respect through
disagreement.

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:18.820
[Offscreen voice]
Take the results well. No matter whether you win or lose.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.240
Currently in the United States we have a

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:25.680
disagreement problem. We find it hard to
debate political positions without

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:31.120
denigrating people. We have come to see
opposition as inherently invalid.

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:36.200
If the political theorists are right, this
disrespect for disagreement does not

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:39.600
bode well for democracy.

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.960
It would be naive to suggest that we could simply

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:47.920
play fight our way to a more just world.
But it is equally naive to assume that

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:52.740
our actions outside the realm of
politics have no effect on the political sphere.

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:58.090
Physical play allows us to manage
competing positions with respect. Whether

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:03.400
we take that opportunity and whether we
learn from it is up to us.
