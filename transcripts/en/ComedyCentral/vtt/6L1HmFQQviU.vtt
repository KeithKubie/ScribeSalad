00:00:01.600 --> 00:00:03.269
â™ª Four and three and two and one

00:00:03.302 --> 00:00:04.370 size:84% position:42%
  - I'm not talking to you.

00:00:04.403 --> 00:00:05.605 size:88% position:44%
 I'm talking to my roommate.

00:00:05.638 --> 00:00:06.806 size:84% position:42%
  - You're not my roommate.

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:07.640 align:start size:88% position:13%
 - You two boyfriend
 and girlfriend?

00:00:07.673 --> 00:00:08.674 size:88% position:44%
  - God, no.

00:00:08.707 --> 00:00:10.343
 He's my roommate's boyfriend.

00:00:10.376 --> 00:00:11.411
 - [Man] So, you know his body?

00:00:11.444 --> 00:00:13.579
- You were jerking off.

00:00:13.612 --> 00:00:15.281 align:start size:88% position:13%
- I wasn't even
touching my wiener yet,

00:00:15.314 --> 00:00:17.050 size:84% position:42%
  I was still just
  doing butt stuff.

00:00:17.083 --> 00:00:17.984
 - Ew!

00:00:18.017 --> 00:00:19.419 size:84% position:42%
  - I'm obviously straight,

00:00:19.452 --> 00:00:22.055 align:start size:88% position:13%
 but I would absolutely
 suck him dry.

00:00:22.088 --> 00:00:23.389
- Okay.

00:00:23.422 --> 00:00:24.424 size:88% position:44%
  - Come on!

00:00:24.457 --> 00:00:26.459
(moans)

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:29.429
 The empire waist is
 reading very Mormon.

00:00:29.462 --> 00:00:31.364
I mean, we could let the
seam out an inch or two,

00:00:31.397 --> 00:00:32.932 size:88% position:44%
  make it a little
  less form-fitting,

00:00:32.965 --> 00:00:35.134
 but, I mean, you just
 got those slut legs.

00:00:35.167 --> 00:00:36.536 size:88% position:44%
  Ugh, next!

00:00:36.569 --> 00:00:37.370
- What?

00:00:37.403 --> 00:00:39.272
 - Don't waste my time.

00:00:39.305 --> 00:00:41.474 align:start size:88% position:13%
I could FaceTime with
you and watch you sleep.

00:00:41.507 --> 00:00:43.109 size:84% position:42%
  - All right, bye.

00:00:43.142 --> 00:00:44.077
 - What are we doing?

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:46.312 size:88% position:44%
  What is this relationship?
