00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:03.420
So, Izabel, let's brainstorm and come up with the perfect

00:00:03.420 --> 00:00:06.970
pizza app for Android. What would your top three features be?

00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:09.730
&gt;&gt; My top three features would be

00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:12.400
seasonal recommendations. Because I think people like

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:13.840
to order new things all the time

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:15.644
and why not take advantage of seasonal ingredients.

00:00:15.644 --> 00:00:16.550
&gt;&gt; Second one?

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:20.930
&gt;&gt; The second thing I would choose would be, a filtered ingredient list.

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:20.990
&gt;&gt; Oh.

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:23.080
&gt;&gt; because some people have food preferences. Like, they can't eat

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:25.570
gluten or they're vegan. So, just remove stuff that they can't

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:27.050
eat, completely off the menu. Just filter it

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:29.425
for them. [CROSSTALK] And third would be Google

00:00:29.425 --> 00:00:31.570
Wallet because this is for Android and that's

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:33.832
the primary way people pay for stuff on Android.

00:00:33.832 --> 00:00:35.360
&gt;&gt; Oh, it's fantastic.

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:37.394
&gt;&gt; So, what about you, what would your, what do

00:00:37.394 --> 00:00:39.860
you think the top three features for this app should be?

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:44.365
&gt;&gt; For me, they're actually a bit different. My number one feature would be

00:00:44.365 --> 00:00:47.300
one-click ordering. Cause I think that the

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:50.630
user would really enjoy very quickly ordering

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:52.530
a pizza for the first time and also coming back and

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:56.780
making repeat orders. The second feature I would pick is, order history.

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:01.090
This would allow someone to find out what they placed an

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:03.620
order for before and see how much money they're spending on pizza.

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:04.200
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:06.420
&gt;&gt; And finally, I think that the user would really

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:10.440
appreciate real time status updates. Because I know that if they're

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:12.960
hungry and they want their pizza delivered, they would want to

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.000
know where it is and when it's going to get there.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.120
&gt;&gt; Perfect.

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:19.470
So, looking at these features, it kind of seems

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:22.330
like the three features you picked are classic

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:24.040
you. Because you're a creature of habit, and

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:25.830
you always order the same food every single time.

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:26.170
&gt;&gt; That's true.

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:28.430
&gt;&gt; So you can get back to coding. You think of food as fuel.

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:29.730
&gt;&gt; I do think of food as fuel. Who doesn't?

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:33.670
&gt;&gt; Yes, and order history, you're like super detailed

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:35.660
with your finances so that kind of makes sense for you.

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:36.200
&gt;&gt; That's true. Good point.

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:38.340
&gt;&gt; And status updates. You're always checking like every five

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:41.190
seconds when your packages don't arrive so, you know, I'm noticing

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:45.160
a trend here. That these are, this kind of sounds like the Nazmul pizza app.

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:46.640
&gt;&gt; It does. It's funny you mentioned

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:49.570
that because your features reflect very much

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:53.830
who you are. Like, you are a foodie. You're extremely picky about what you eat.

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:54.110
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:57.160
&gt;&gt; And so the seasonal recommendations make sense, and also the menu

00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:00.450
filtering is a good option for you because you don't like gluten.

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:00.900
&gt;&gt; Yep.

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:05.550
&gt;&gt; And the Google Wallet makes sense, because you are super-fan Android user.

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:06.280
&gt;&gt; Yeah, these features

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:08.008
are kind of classic me.

00:02:08.008 --> 00:02:10.110
&gt;&gt; So what are your favorite features, and do

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:12.500
they reflect on who you are? Are they classic you?
