00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 align:start position:0%
like I don't know it was kind of cute
 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:02.930 align:start position:0%
like I don't know it was kind of cute
and<00:01:01.469><c> again</c><00:01:01.680><c> it</c><00:01:01.980><c> sort</c><00:01:02.129><c> of</c><00:01:02.219><c> made</c><00:01:02.399><c> sense</c><00:01:02.550><c> because</c>

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 align:start position:0%
and again it sort of made sense because
 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:04.579 align:start position:0%
and again it sort of made sense because
as<00:01:03.120><c> they</c><00:01:03.210><c> say</c><00:01:03.390><c> you</c><00:01:03.449><c> know</c><00:01:03.570><c> surfer</c><00:01:03.960><c> Louis</c><00:01:04.229><c> moment</c>

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 align:start position:0%
as they say you know surfer Louis moment
 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:06.050 align:start position:0%
as they say you know surfer Louis moment
her<00:01:04.710><c> powers</c><00:01:05.010><c> are</c><00:01:05.159><c> gone</c><00:01:05.250><c> so</c><00:01:05.460><c> it's</c><00:01:05.580><c> like</c><00:01:05.700><c> using</c>

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 align:start position:0%
her powers are gone so it's like using
 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.149 align:start position:0%
her powers are gone so it's like using
just<00:01:06.210><c> whatever</c><00:01:06.659><c> she</c><00:01:06.960><c> knows</c><00:01:07.140><c> of</c><00:01:07.470><c> the</c><00:01:07.619><c> element</c>

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 align:start position:0%
just whatever she knows of the element
 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:11.149 align:start position:0%
just whatever she knows of the element
there<00:01:08.490><c> and</c><00:01:09.110><c> that</c><00:01:10.110><c> would</c><00:01:10.290><c> probably</c><00:01:10.680><c> result</c><00:01:10.860><c> in</c>

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 align:start position:0%
there and that would probably result in
 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:12.710 align:start position:0%
there and that would probably result in
everything<00:01:11.580><c> so</c><00:01:11.729><c> I</c><00:01:11.760><c> like</c><00:01:12.090><c> that</c><00:01:12.270><c> you</c><00:01:12.390><c> for</c>

00:13:37.970 --> 00:13:37.980 align:start position:0%
and that's what you're going to compare
 

00:13:37.980 --> 00:13:39.440 align:start position:0%
and that's what you're going to compare
it<00:13:38.010><c> but</c><00:13:38.220><c> again</c><00:13:38.340><c> I</c><00:13:38.640><c> don't</c><00:13:38.700><c> need</c><00:13:38.970><c> to</c><00:13:39.090><c> be</c><00:13:39.180><c> as</c><00:13:39.300><c> good</c>

00:13:39.440 --> 00:13:39.450 align:start position:0%
it but again I don't need to be as good
