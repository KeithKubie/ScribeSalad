story and this was a project that and we
 

00:43:04.880 --> 00:43:06.610 align:start position:0%
story and this was a project that and we
use<00:43:05.030><c> it</c><00:43:05.240><c> internally</c><00:43:05.390><c> as</c><00:43:05.930><c> a</c><00:43:05.960><c> lessons</c><00:43:06.380><c> learned</c>

00:43:06.610 --> 00:43:06.620 align:start position:0%
use it internally as a lessons learned
 

00:43:06.620 --> 00:43:09.130 align:start position:0%
use it internally as a lessons learned
that<00:43:07.220><c> was</c><00:43:07.370><c> done</c><00:43:07.520><c> in</c><00:43:07.640><c> Singapore</c><00:43:08.120><c> where</c><00:43:09.020><c> we</c>

00:43:09.130 --> 00:43:09.140 align:start position:0%
that was done in Singapore where we
 

00:43:09.140 --> 00:43:10.720 align:start position:0%
that was done in Singapore where we
stood<00:43:09.380><c> up</c><00:43:09.530><c> an</c><00:43:09.890><c> electric</c><00:43:10.310><c> vehicle</c><00:43:10.430><c> charging</c>

00:43:10.720 --> 00:43:10.730 align:start position:0%
stood up an electric vehicle charging
 

00:43:10.730 --> 00:43:14.020 align:start position:0%
stood up an electric vehicle charging
network<00:43:11.620><c> with</c><00:43:12.620><c> multiple</c><00:43:13.100><c> charge</c><00:43:13.700><c> point</c>

00:43:14.020 --> 00:43:14.030 align:start position:0%

00:43:14.030 --> 00:43:16.900 align:start position:0%
network with multiple charge point
operators<00:43:14.660><c> and</c><00:43:15.020><c> I</c><00:43:15.740><c> think</c><00:43:16.280><c> in</c><00:43:16.370><c> the</c><00:43:16.460><c> in</c><00:43:16.610><c> the</c><00:43:16.730><c> end</c>

00:43:16.900 --> 00:43:16.910 align:start position:0%
operators and I think in the in the end
 

00:43:16.910 --> 00:43:19.720 align:start position:0%
operators and I think in the in the end
it<00:43:17.060><c> was</c><00:43:17.350><c> 74</c><00:43:18.350><c> different</c><00:43:18.530><c> charging</c><00:43:19.100><c> point</c>

00:43:19.720 --> 00:43:19.730 align:start position:0%
it was 74 different charging point
 

00:43:19.730 --> 00:43:22.150 align:start position:0%
it was 74 different charging point
stations<00:43:20.000><c> I</c><00:43:20.680><c> think</c><00:43:21.680><c> it</c><00:43:21.770><c> was</c><00:43:21.860><c> three</c><00:43:22.010><c> or</c><00:43:22.100><c> four</c>

00:43:22.150 --> 00:43:22.160 align:start position:0%
stations I think it was three or four
 

00:43:22.160 --> 00:43:24.070 align:start position:0%
stations I think it was three or four
different<00:43:22.400><c> vendors</c><00:43:22.850><c> everything</c><00:43:23.750><c> went</c><00:43:23.930><c> well</c>

00:43:24.070 --> 00:43:24.080 align:start position:0%
different vendors everything went well
 

00:43:24.080 --> 00:43:26.710 align:start position:0%
different vendors everything went well
it<00:43:24.470><c> stood</c><00:43:24.800><c> up</c><00:43:24.830><c> is</c><00:43:25.220><c> if</c><00:43:25.520><c> it</c><00:43:25.640><c> was</c><00:43:25.730><c> 2011</c><00:43:26.570><c> it</c>

00:43:26.710 --> 00:43:26.720 align:start position:0%
it stood up is if it was 2011 it
 

00:43:26.720 --> 00:43:29.350 align:start position:0%
it stood up is if it was 2011 it
operated<00:43:27.230><c> for</c><00:43:27.410><c> I</c><00:43:27.470><c> think</c><00:43:27.680><c> two</c><00:43:28.070><c> years</c><00:43:28.360><c> everybody</c>

00:43:29.350 --> 00:43:29.360 align:start position:0%
operated for I think two years everybody
 

00:43:29.360 --> 00:43:31.600 align:start position:0%
operated for I think two years everybody
was<00:43:29.510><c> very</c><00:43:29.540><c> happy</c><00:43:29.750><c> but</c><00:43:30.650><c> the</c><00:43:30.950><c> problem</c><00:43:31.280><c> was</c><00:43:31.430><c> there</c>

00:43:31.600 --> 00:43:31.610 align:start position:0%
was very happy but the problem was there
 

00:43:31.610 --> 00:43:32.930 align:start position:0%
was very happy but the problem was there
was<00:43:31.700><c> no</c><00:43:31.820><c> electric</c><00:43:32.150><c> vehicles</c>

00:43:32.930 --> 00:43:32.940 align:start position:0%
was no electric vehicles
 

00:43:32.940 --> 00:43:36.940 align:start position:0%
was no electric vehicles
[Laughter]

00:43:36.940 --> 00:43:36.950 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 

00:43:36.950 --> 00:43:42.200 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
so<00:43:37.950><c> kind</c><00:43:38.190><c> of</c><00:43:38.220><c> a</c><00:43:38.309><c> success</c><00:43:38.910><c> failure</c><00:43:39.329><c> story</c><00:43:41.210><c> but</c>

00:43:42.200 --> 00:43:42.210 align:start position:0%
so kind of a success failure story but
 

00:43:42.210 --> 00:43:45.079 align:start position:0%
so kind of a success failure story but
we<00:43:42.480><c> learned</c><00:43:42.720><c> a</c><00:43:42.809><c> lot</c><00:43:42.960><c> and</c><00:43:43.549><c> we</c><00:43:44.549><c> do</c><00:43:44.730><c> use</c><00:43:44.910><c> it</c>

00:43:45.079 --> 00:43:45.089 align:start position:0%
we learned a lot and we do use it
 

00:43:45.089 --> 00:43:47.960 align:start position:0%
we learned a lot and we do use it
internally<00:43:45.390><c> as</c><00:43:45.720><c> the</c><00:43:45.839><c> lessons</c><00:43:46.200><c> learned</c><00:43:46.759><c> and</c><00:43:47.759><c> we</c>

00:43:47.960 --> 00:43:47.970 align:start position:0%
internally as the lessons learned and we
 

00:43:47.970 --> 00:43:50.240 align:start position:0%
internally as the lessons learned and we
hope<00:43:48.450><c> to</c><00:43:48.480><c> take</c><00:43:49.289><c> some</c><00:43:49.589><c> of</c><00:43:49.710><c> those</c><00:43:49.799><c> lessons</c>

00:43:50.240 --> 00:43:50.250 align:start position:0%
hope to take some of those lessons
 

00:43:50.250 --> 00:43:52.220 align:start position:0%
hope to take some of those lessons
learns<00:43:50.430><c> and</c><00:43:50.640><c> deploy</c><00:43:50.880><c> those</c><00:43:51.089><c> in</c><00:43:51.269><c> cities</c><00:43:51.539><c> so</c>

00:43:52.220 --> 00:43:52.230 align:start position:0%
learns and deploy those in cities so
 

00:43:52.230 --> 00:43:55.009 align:start position:0%
learns and deploy those in cities so
that's<00:43:52.619><c> a</c><00:43:53.309><c> great</c><00:43:53.519><c> story</c><00:43:53.880><c> to</c><00:43:54.089><c> end</c><00:43:54.240><c> on</c><00:43:54.450><c> because</c><00:43:54.930><c> I</c>
