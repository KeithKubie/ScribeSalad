00:00:00.028 --> 00:00:01.574
- [Instructor] So let's
say I have two functions

00:00:01.574 --> 00:00:03.268
that are the inverse of each other.

00:00:03.268 --> 00:00:05.382
So I have f of x,

00:00:05.382 --> 00:00:08.176
and then I also have g of x,

00:00:08.176 --> 00:00:10.729
which is equal to the inverse of f of x.

00:00:10.729 --> 00:00:13.786
And f of x would be the
inverse of g of x as well.

00:00:13.786 --> 00:00:15.643
If the notion of an inverse function

00:00:15.643 --> 00:00:17.237
is completely unfamiliar to you,

00:00:17.237 --> 00:00:21.162
I encourage you to review inverse
functions on Khan Academy.

00:00:21.162 --> 00:00:23.813
Now, one of the properties
of inverse functions

00:00:23.813 --> 00:00:27.063
are that if I were to take g of f of x,

00:00:28.098 --> 00:00:32.111
g of f of x, or I could say
the f inverse of f of x,

00:00:32.111 --> 00:00:35.807
that this is just going to be equal to x.

00:00:35.807 --> 00:00:37.445
And it comes straight out of what

00:00:37.445 --> 00:00:39.042
an inverse of a function is.

00:00:39.042 --> 00:00:41.155
If this is x right over here,

00:00:41.155 --> 00:00:44.322
the function f would map to some value

00:00:45.172 --> 00:00:46.442
f of x.

00:00:46.442 --> 00:00:48.918
So that's f of x right over there.

00:00:48.918 --> 00:00:51.606
And then the function g, or f inverse,

00:00:51.606 --> 00:00:55.316
if you input f of x into
it, it would take you back,

00:00:55.316 --> 00:00:57.352
it would take you back to x.

00:00:57.352 --> 00:00:58.868
So that would be f inverse,

00:00:58.868 --> 00:01:02.173
or we're saying g is the
same thing as f inverse.

00:01:02.173 --> 00:01:05.532
So all of that so far is a
review of inverse functions,

00:01:05.532 --> 00:01:08.180
but now we're going to apply a
little bit of calculus to it,

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:09.581
using the chain rule.

00:01:09.581 --> 00:01:11.780
And we're gonna get a
pretty interesting result.

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:13.322
What I want to do is take the derivative

00:01:13.322 --> 00:01:16.321
of both sides of this
equation right over here.

00:01:16.321 --> 00:01:19.096
So let's apply the derivative operator,

00:01:19.096 --> 00:01:21.483
d/dx on the left-hand side,

00:01:21.483 --> 00:01:24.904
d/dx on the right-hand side.

00:01:24.904 --> 00:01:26.653
And what are we going to get?

00:01:26.653 --> 00:01:30.762
Well, on the left-hand side,
we would apply the chain rule.

00:01:30.762 --> 00:01:33.934
So this is going to be the derivative of g

00:01:33.934 --> 00:01:36.518
with respect to f of x.

00:01:36.518 --> 00:01:39.185
So that's going to be g prime of

00:01:40.089 --> 00:01:41.503
f of x,

00:01:41.503 --> 00:01:43.106
g prime of f of x,

00:01:43.106 --> 00:01:46.097
times the derivative of
f of x with respect to x,

00:01:46.097 --> 00:01:47.453
so times

00:01:47.453 --> 00:01:48.536
f prime of x.

00:01:49.419 --> 00:01:51.957
And then that is going
to be equal to what?

00:01:51.957 --> 00:01:54.411
Well, the derivative
with respect to x of x,

00:01:54.411 --> 00:01:56.977
that's just equal to one.

00:01:56.977 --> 00:01:59.278
And this is where we get
our interesting result.

00:01:59.278 --> 00:02:01.026
All we did so far is we used

00:02:01.026 --> 00:02:02.762
something we knew about inverse functions,

00:02:02.762 --> 00:02:03.919
and we'd use the chain rule

00:02:03.919 --> 00:02:06.096
to take the derivative
of the left-hand side.

00:02:06.096 --> 00:02:09.930
But if you divide both
sides by g prime of f of x,

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:11.592
what are you going to get?

00:02:11.592 --> 00:02:13.020
You're going to get a relationship

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:14.544
between the derivative of a function

00:02:14.544 --> 00:02:16.460
and the derivative of its inverse.

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:18.377
So you get f prime of x

00:02:19.539 --> 00:02:21.930
is going to be equal to

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:24.596
one over all of this business,

00:02:24.596 --> 00:02:25.929
one over g prime

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:28.553
of

00:02:28.553 --> 00:02:29.930
f of x,

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:31.936
g prime of f of x.

00:02:31.936 --> 00:02:34.343
And this is really neat
because if you know something

00:02:34.343 --> 00:02:36.249
about the derivative of a function,

00:02:36.249 --> 00:02:38.311
you can then start to figure out things

00:02:38.311 --> 00:02:40.290
about the derivative of its inverse.

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:42.112
And we can actually see this is true

00:02:42.112 --> 00:02:44.067
with some classic functions.

00:02:44.067 --> 00:02:46.628
So let's say that f of x

00:02:46.628 --> 00:02:47.545
is equal to

00:02:48.735 --> 00:02:50.109
e to the x,

00:02:50.109 --> 00:02:52.025
and so g of x

00:02:52.025 --> 00:02:55.203
would be equal to the inverse of f.

00:02:55.203 --> 00:02:56.286
So f inverse,

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:00.325
which is, what's the
inverse of e to the x?

00:03:00.325 --> 00:03:01.661
Well, one way to think about it is,

00:03:01.661 --> 00:03:03.864
if you have y is equal to e to the x,

00:03:03.864 --> 00:03:05.792
if you want the inverse,
you can swap the variables

00:03:05.792 --> 00:03:07.299
and then solve for y again.

00:03:07.299 --> 00:03:10.628
So you'd get x is equal to e to the y.

00:03:10.628 --> 00:03:12.371
You take the natural log of both sides,

00:03:12.371 --> 00:03:15.397
you get natural log of x is equal to y.

00:03:15.397 --> 00:03:18.634
So the inverse of e to
the x is natural log of x.

00:03:18.634 --> 00:03:20.889
And once again, that's all
review of inverse functions.

00:03:20.889 --> 00:03:24.407
All right, if that's unfamiliar,
review it on Khan Academy.

00:03:24.407 --> 00:03:27.593
So g of x is going to be equal to

00:03:27.593 --> 00:03:29.892
the natural log of x.

00:03:29.892 --> 00:03:33.737
Now, let's see if this holds
true for these two functions.

00:03:33.737 --> 00:03:36.426
Well, what is f prime of x going to be?

00:03:36.426 --> 00:03:38.956
Well, this one of those
amazing results in calculus.

00:03:38.956 --> 00:03:42.901
One of these neat things
about the number e is that

00:03:42.901 --> 00:03:46.904
the derivative of e to
the x is e to the x.

00:03:46.904 --> 00:03:49.882
And in other videos, we
also saw that the derivative

00:03:49.882 --> 00:03:53.653
of the natural log of x is one over x.

00:03:53.653 --> 00:03:55.317
So let's see if this holds out.

00:03:55.317 --> 00:03:57.820
So we should get a result, f prime of x,

00:03:57.820 --> 00:03:59.441
e to the x

00:03:59.441 --> 00:04:00.941
should be equal to

00:04:01.851 --> 00:04:02.684
one over

00:04:04.398 --> 00:04:05.898
g prime of f of x.

00:04:07.069 --> 00:04:08.866
So g prime of f of x,

00:04:08.866 --> 00:04:10.691
so g prime is one

00:04:10.691 --> 00:04:12.752
over our f of x,

00:04:12.752 --> 00:04:15.039
and f of x is e to the x,

00:04:15.039 --> 00:04:16.939
one over e to the x.

00:04:16.939 --> 00:04:18.780
Is this indeed true?

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:19.613
Yes, it is.

00:04:19.613 --> 00:04:21.381
One over, one over e to the x

00:04:21.381 --> 00:04:23.964
is just going to be e to the x.

00:04:23.964 --> 00:04:25.863
So it all checks out.

00:04:25.863 --> 00:04:26.882
And you could do the other way

00:04:26.882 --> 00:04:28.753
because these are inverses of each other.

00:04:28.753 --> 00:04:30.719
You could say g prime of x is going

00:04:30.719 --> 00:04:34.155
to be equal to one over f prime of g of x

00:04:34.155 --> 00:04:36.089
because they're inverses of each other.

00:04:36.089 --> 00:04:38.102
And actually, what's
really neat about this,

00:04:38.102 --> 00:04:41.010
is that you could actually use
this to get a sense of what

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:45.044
the derivative of an inverse
function is even going to be.
