00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:01.010
Last one.

00:00:01.010 --> 00:00:03.350
&gt;&gt; So, the last one we have
our expectation again,

00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:07.470
which I like, and
now we are going to do minimax.

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:10.080
What you said, before we
started going through the quiz,

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:13.780
is that you are kind of treating
this as a joint action space.

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:15.750
It's sort of you taking an action and

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:20.310
then your opponent taking an action and
so on and so forth.

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:23.336
Really, I don't know what
I would call this, but

00:00:23.336 --> 00:00:27.889
it looks a lot like just regular old
game search when you have zero sum game.

00:00:27.889 --> 00:00:30.070
&gt;&gt; Yeah, zero sum game,
that's exactly what I would call it.

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:32.890
And we're going to talk a lot more
about variations of algorithms

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:36.260
that act like this that deal with
the case when there's multiple agents.

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:39.330
But this was sort of a nice
setting to bring it up because

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:42.890
the basic result says that if
we've got a generalized MDP.

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:44.260
We've got this operator and

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:48.570
this operator defined in such
a way that it's a non-expansion.

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:54.772
And it turns out all these things,
mini-max, this rank-weighted idea,

00:00:54.772 --> 00:01:00.140
max, the linear combination,
expectation, min.

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:01.910
All these things are all non-expansion.

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:05.730
So all these things value iteration
will do something reasonable.

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:09.410
It'll actually come out with
a fixed point in the limit.

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:12.590
&gt;&gt; So actually min, max,
all of these things and

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:15.910
ord, row of ord,
they're all convex sums.

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:19.330
So does this mean that all convex
combinations are non-expansive?

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:20.780
&gt;&gt; So that's a great question.

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:22.970
They are all convex combinations,
that's true.

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:27.401
It is not the case that arbitrary convex
combinations result in non-expansions.

00:01:27.401 --> 00:01:31.950
In particular,
if the weights of the convex combination

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:36.290
depend on the values, the actual
magnitude of the values in some way,

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:39.690
then we need not get anything
that is a non-expansion.

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:40.880
&gt;&gt; Okay.
So, that's good to know.

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:42.550
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
And that actually comes up in a really

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:45.420
important setting,
which is if you're doing not, say,

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:49.110
epsilon greedy, exploration which
corresponds to the third line here.

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:51.920
But instead we're doing something
like Boltzmann exploration

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:54.350
we could run into trouble.

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:57.610
So, I think that it's for this kind of
introduction to generalized MDPs and

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:00.470
I think that actually finishes
the section on convergence.

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:02.280
So you're ready for some recap?

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:03.280
&gt;&gt; Yes I love recapping.
