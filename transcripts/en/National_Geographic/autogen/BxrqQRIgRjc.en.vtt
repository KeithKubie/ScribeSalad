what we're doing is we're just sort of
rolling out some muscles so yeah get

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:03.510
rolling out some muscles so yeah get
 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:06.099
rolling out some muscles so yeah get
involved in that do some basic shapes

00:00:06.099 --> 00:00:06.109

not clear whether it loops around here

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630
not clear whether it loops around here
 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:32.690
not clear whether it loops around here
or whether I can just come over there oh

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700
or whether I can just come over there oh
 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:36.740

look they begin with the legs thighs and

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750
look they begin with the legs thighs and
 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:42.470

tail speed sculpting it's all right here

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480
tail speed sculpting it's all right here
 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.690
tail speed sculpting it's all right here
so it turns in there like a little

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700
so it turns in there like a little
 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:46.549

string but yeah how thick would these

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559
string but yeah how thick would these
 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:50.630

muscles be in a real tear a change how

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640
muscles be in a real tear a change how
 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:51.979
muscles be in a real tear a change how
would they connect with the other thing

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989
would they connect with the other thing
 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:53.450
would they connect with the other thing
I've come round in cross-section as it

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460
I've come round in cross-section as it
 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:55.880
I've come round in cross-section as it
goes over yeah so it would fill up here

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890
goes over yeah so it would fill up here
 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:58.819
goes over yeah so it would fill up here
so it wraps around like that yeah when

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829
so it wraps around like that yeah when
 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:01.490
so it wraps around like that yeah when
