This video is sponsored by the Walking Dead No Man's Land

00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:01.000
Which is the official game that follows the TV series The Walking Dead

00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:04.060
I put a link down in the description so you can download the game for free

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:10.440
and it comes with a special offer

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:12.340
I'll tell you about in a couple of minutes.

00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:13.650
Hey guys welcome back. I'm Nate

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:16.049
Thanks for joining us today on The King of Random in the past

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:18.480
We've had several videos showing you a bunch of different life hacks.

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:20.489
Well today, we've got 10 different survival hacks

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:22.439
weâ€™re gonna show you. These are all little ideas

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:25.380
you might be able to use in an emergency situation to help yourself out.

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:27.119
Whether you're camping, hiking exploring,

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:27.620
or it's the end of the world.

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:32.960
These are some tips you might find useful, how to make a compass using a cup of water, a pocketknife, and a needle

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:37.380
It doesn't need to be a needle any piece of straight metal that sticks to a magnet should work

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:41.609
Just fine the first step is to take your pocketknife and line it up on the edge of your needle

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:46.439
They're then going to run the blade of the knife along the needle in the same direction 50 to 100 times

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:52.079
After about a hundred passes the needle should have picked up a slight magnetic charge

00:00:52.449 --> 00:00:55.649
Next we want to cut out a small circle of paper that easily fits within the cup

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:59.429
But is large enough that it's almost the size of the needle if you don't have regular paper

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:05.189
You can also use toilet paper paper towel or even a smooth leaf if your needles properly magnetized it will orient itself

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:07.379
facing north and south

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:12.449
Because the orientation of the needle depends on which tool you use to magnetize it

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:16.739
Check your surroundings for context clues to figure out which direction is north and south

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:19.799
That's a quick and easy way to make yourself a compass

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:24.719
If you're lost and need to signal for help one of the easiest ways to do that is with a whistle and there's an extremely

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:29.489
Easy way you can make a whistle with a hard candy in fact. We don't need the candy at all rather

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:31.150
We need the wrapper that it comes in

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:35.339
Simply take an edge of the wrapper and pull it tight between your fingers and then blow on the tight edge

00:01:39.369 --> 00:01:45.029
If your pocket had a pocket you could fit this whistle in that pocket this type of whistle takes up virtually no space

00:01:45.369 --> 00:01:47.789
Whatsoever so it's great for emergency packs

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:52.320
one of the most important things to do if you're in a survival situation is to make sure you have enough water

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:55.829
Let's take a look at how you can use a regular soda bottle to efficiently collect rainwater

00:01:56.290 --> 00:01:58.200
Obviously if you just leave a soda bottle open

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:02.219
It's not gonna catch much rainwater, and even if you cut off the top your area is gonna

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:03.149
Be pretty limited

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:06.329
So this hack is to show you how to get the most out of your soda bottle in collecting rainwater

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:09.869
the first step is to cut off either the top or the bottom of your soda bottle if

00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:13.009
How you want to let it sit if you just want it to sit on a flat surface

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:16.069
Remove the top if you have some sand or loose dirt

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:21.498
And you want to be able to push your bottle down into that remove the bottom since I'm doing this demonstration on a tabletop

00:02:21.499 --> 00:02:23.569
I'm going to remove the top of my soda bottle

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:27.889
With the top removed let's cut strips into the side of the bottle starting about two inches up

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:37.969
Now what we want to do is take each of these pieces. We've just cut and bends them out

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:43.250
You can see that if you just bend them the plastic doesn't like to stay in place an easy fix is to take a lighter

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:45.439
And apply a little bit of heat right at the curve

00:02:45.629 --> 00:02:49.249
It will only take a second, and then the plastic will hold itself folded down

00:02:55.500 --> 00:03:00.210
If any of the little pieces need adjusting just apply a little bit more heat and bend it either up or down

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:04.409
Now as rain falls on your bottle. It will be collected by the branches extending outward

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:10.649
Someday you may find yourself wanting to fish for food, but not having any bait

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:15.870
here's a quick way to make yourself an easy fishing lure to try and catch yourself to dinner all we need is some paracord a

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:18.929
Fish hook a lighter and a knife to start off

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:21.600
We want to cut off a piece of our paracord about an inch and a half long

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:26.460
Pull the inside strands of your paracord, so they extend about half an inch beyond the regular body of the cord

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:29.100
We then want to cut off some of the excess back of the cord

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:32.219
So we only have three quarters to one inch of our paracord left

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:34.390
You should be able to see the inside

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:39.419
Cord lined up with the top where you just cut it we now want to feed our paracord onto the fish hook from the end

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:43.619
That doesn't have the strands sticking out the fish hook will stick out through the side of the paracord

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:47.279
Smooth the top of the cut end together and fuse it all using your lighter

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:56.580
With the paracord attached we now want to fray out the main body of the cord and the ends of the inner strands

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:04.550
At this point your fishing lure is complete so it's time to attach it to a line and catch yourself some dinner

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:06.230
If you're out hiking or camping

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:10.759
And you don't have dry usable toilet paper it can certainly feel like the end of the world. Here's a little hack

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:13.550
You can use to keep your toilet paper dry and usable while you're camping

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:19.519
first step is to yourself an empty plastic coffee container with a lid that comes on and off now there are three different things we

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:24.619
Need to cut out of our container the first is a slit the same width as a toilet paper in the main body and then

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:26.620
We need to cut two holes one in either end

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:31.189
With your people's cut out remove the lid and put your toilet paper roll

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:32.610
inside the container

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:37.430
You should be able to feed the toilet paper through the slot you cut and now you have a nice toilet paper dispenser

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:40.669
Now to take our dispenser one step further

00:04:40.669 --> 00:04:44.989
I'm going to take a length of rope and pass it through the container and the toilet paper roll inside

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:54.549
We can now hang our toilet paper roll next to whatever we're using out in the wilderness

00:04:54.770 --> 00:05:00.639
they have it an EZ toilet paper dispenser that keeps your teepee nice and dry and hey guys grant here for a second in the

00:05:00.639 --> 00:05:02.470
spirit of apocalyptic camping hacks

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:06.789
I've put a link at the top of the description to a free game with a special offer available only right now

00:05:06.789 --> 00:05:08.169
It's called the walking dead

00:05:08.889 --> 00:05:14.799
And it's AMC's official mobile game that follows the Walking Dead series on TV the game uses characters

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:20.800
You know from the TV show The Walking Dead in the actual Walking Dead locations now if you download the game before December 19th

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:22.220
You'll have access to unlock

00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:29.109
negan for free and there's weekly content being put out to follow every episode in season 8 the updates come out each Monday after the

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:35.530
Episodes post and these missions follow the survivors of The Walking Dead and offer another glimpse and angle into the events of that week's episode

00:05:35.530 --> 00:05:40.329
Of the show so not only do you get to hang out with your favorite characters like Daryl Rick can be shown and negan?

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:46.479
But you get to relive and replay the highlights from the episode you saw the day before so about the game you basically take turns

00:05:46.479 --> 00:05:49.628
Moving people around and then the walkers take turns moving as well

00:05:49.629 --> 00:05:54.699
It does help to use a bit of strategy and some tactical maneuvers if you can line up enough walkers in a row you might

00:05:54.699 --> 00:05:56.110
Get three of them with one shot

00:05:56.110 --> 00:05:59.650
That's always helpful, and the better you position your team the better chance you have of winning

00:05:59.650 --> 00:06:02.919
And there's some back-end strategy as well because not only are you playing the game?

00:06:02.919 --> 00:06:07.448
But you have an encampment that you can develop add to and build out and fortify

00:06:07.449 --> 00:06:09.579
That'll give you some benefits to help move you through the game

00:06:09.610 --> 00:06:15.310
It works on iOS Android and pretty much any other device, and it's a really fun way to develop strategy and spend your time

00:06:15.310 --> 00:06:18.789
So if you like zombies want to help rescue humanity and hang out with characters

00:06:18.789 --> 00:06:19.400
You know and love

00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:23.739
Go down to the first link in the description and download the game for free and now that we've talked about that

00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:25.699
Let's get back to the hacks

00:06:25.699 --> 00:06:26.800
Let's Sierra on the wilderness

00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:30.969
And you need to cut a piece of rope but for some reason you don't have a knife with you. Well don't worry

00:06:30.969 --> 00:06:36.009
There's a way you can actually cut the rope with the rope itself. First is to measure off the length that you need to use

00:06:38.169 --> 00:06:42.718
Let's say I need exactly that much rope now. I'm going to tie two knots on either

00:06:42.719 --> 00:06:46.739
End of where I want the rope cut this will help prevent fraying later now

00:06:46.740 --> 00:06:50.189
You'll want to put your rope on the ground and step on it on both sides of your knots

00:06:50.770 --> 00:06:55.259
Run the other end of your rope between the first part and begin sawing back and forth

00:07:00.490 --> 00:07:04.710
For the friction and the heat from the sawing motion will eventually cut its way through the rope

00:07:04.780 --> 00:07:08.610
Like I said the knots help prevent the rope from fraying too much after it splits

00:07:09.070 --> 00:07:12.689
Cold wind and rain can really exacerbate any bad situation

00:07:12.690 --> 00:07:16.230
And if you've got leaky clothing or shoes it can make it even worse

00:07:16.450 --> 00:07:22.469
One way to temporarily relieve those symptoms is to use a lip balm as a sealant against water and wind one of the most common

00:07:22.470 --> 00:07:27.090
Places for hiking boots to start leaking is right around the scenes if you take a little bit of lip balm and spread it along

00:07:27.090 --> 00:07:32.459
The stitching and then heat it with a lighter the oils from the lip balm can penetrate the material and really help stop the water

00:07:32.460 --> 00:07:34.460
from getting in

00:07:35.200 --> 00:07:40.830
Similarly cold air in water can sometimes leak in through the zipper of a coat so you can use your chapstick on the zipper to

00:07:40.830 --> 00:07:42.640
Try and help form a little bit more of a barrier

00:07:42.640 --> 00:07:44.340
It's not a great permanent fix

00:07:44.340 --> 00:07:49.019
But it should work in a pinch if you desperately need your chapstick to keep your lips from splitting in bad weather

00:07:49.350 --> 00:07:51.570
I wouldn't recommend you use it on your shoes in your jacket

00:07:51.870 --> 00:07:53.580
If water getting into your clothing is a bigger problem

00:07:53.580 --> 00:07:57.840
It might be worth it to you lip balm is made mostly of oil which means in an emergency

00:07:57.840 --> 00:08:02.369
we can use it to burn for light or heat using any sort of container that will hold it we can add a wick and

00:08:02.370 --> 00:08:06.390
Light it on fire. I have here a piece of cotton cloth that I cut off of an old backpack this should work

00:08:06.390 --> 00:08:11.669
Well as a wick for our makeshift oil lamp you can use just about anything as a container while this burns a pot a metal

00:08:11.670 --> 00:08:14.189
Cup our rock with a little concave divot in it

00:08:14.190 --> 00:08:16.740
I'm just gonna use a piece of foil with the edges folded up

00:08:17.170 --> 00:08:21.119
Extend your lip balm all the way out and remove it from the plastic container entirely

00:08:21.790 --> 00:08:24.900
At this point what you have is basically a stick of thick oil

00:08:27.960 --> 00:08:28.539
As

00:08:28.539 --> 00:08:33.929
The fire starts heating and melting lip-balm it will begin to burn the oil as fuel instead of the cotton cloth

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:39.209
You can see that the lip balm has melted and started puddling down at the bottom the conditions

00:08:39.209 --> 00:08:41.999
We have outside right now is a little windy, but that actually helps to illustrate

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:46.799
how useful it can be if you have a match that won't stay lit you can light your piece of cotton on fire in the

00:08:46.800 --> 00:08:49.110
oil
And it will keep burning for quite a while

00:08:49.300 --> 00:08:52.709
You can use this as light or a source of heat to start a bigger fire oh

00:08:55.810 --> 00:08:58.560
Now it's spread oil everywhere well

00:08:58.560 --> 00:08:59.220
I tried to pick it up

00:08:59.220 --> 00:09:03.240
And I dropped it and it's spread oil all over the sides of containers so now all of its on fire

00:09:03.430 --> 00:09:06.510
There's enough oil in one tube of lip balm to burn for up to 20 minutes

00:09:06.820 --> 00:09:10.950
I'm a firm believer that you should always bring the equipment that you're going to need with you when you go out into the wilderness

00:09:11.200 --> 00:09:16.559
But it doesn't hurt to provide yourself with a backup this little fire starter kit is available at most camping stores

00:09:16.560 --> 00:09:21.299
It has a ferrocerium rod on a block of magnesium. You can use this to start fires pretty easily

00:09:21.490 --> 00:09:23.760
we're going to try to remove the striker rod and

00:09:23.830 --> 00:09:28.889
Embed it in the shoelaces of our boots so that we always have a backup fire starter in case we lose everything else

00:09:29.020 --> 00:09:33.029
First thing we need to do is remove the rod from the magnesium block. It's attached to that

00:09:35.560 --> 00:09:39.719
Popped off pretty easily there's still a little bit of epoxy attached to our stick

00:09:39.720 --> 00:09:41.720
So I'm going to try and clean it off with a knife

00:09:41.890 --> 00:09:44.039
Now let's grab a hacksaw and cut this in half

00:09:49.740 --> 00:09:52.099
Cut it fast enough it sparkles that

00:09:57.540 --> 00:10:01.849
Is the most entertaining thing to cut in half I have ever cut in half that is great

00:10:01.889 --> 00:10:04.188
If everything sparked like that when you cut it

00:10:04.189 --> 00:10:09.169
I would just saw things in half probably all day long we now have our two different halves of our striker rod

00:10:09.540 --> 00:10:13.759
Shoelaces are often a little bit too thin, so we're going to replace the shoelaces on this boot with paracord

00:10:14.339 --> 00:10:18.979
Cut a length of paracord to the same length as the shoelace on your boot, and then fuse one end with a lighter

00:10:27.290 --> 00:10:30.640
Pull back the end of the paracord and pull out the center strands a couple of inches

00:10:30.950 --> 00:10:35.770
We want to cut off some of the center strands a little bit longer than the length of our striker rod

00:10:35.870 --> 00:10:39.609
Pull the outside of the paracord back into place so that you can feel that part of its hollow

00:10:39.680 --> 00:10:46.060
And part of it still has the center strands when you compress the paracord down together it loosens up and expands in width

00:10:46.340 --> 00:10:51.609
Press it down a little bit and fit your striker rod down inside the hollow portion of the paracord

00:10:51.920 --> 00:10:56.050
Once your entire striker is inside the paracord use your lighter to seal off the end

00:10:56.690 --> 00:10:59.590
You can decide if you want both halves of your striker rod in one boot

00:10:59.590 --> 00:11:00.760
Or if you want to split it up

00:11:00.760 --> 00:11:05.169
So one is in each shoelace if you're in an emergency situation where you need the striker odd to make fire

00:11:05.270 --> 00:11:11.859
Simply cut open the paracord and remove the rod a good place to store the striker for your rod is underneath the sole of your

00:11:11.860 --> 00:11:16.930
Boot I'm going to use a small piece of this tape to hold the striker in place on the sole of the boot

00:11:20.090 --> 00:11:21.560
Now in an emergency situation

00:11:21.560 --> 00:11:24.250
I have a flint rod and a striker always attached to my boots

00:11:24.350 --> 00:11:27.490
You may someday find yourself in a situation where your cell phone has a dead battery

00:11:27.490 --> 00:11:29.410
And you have no good way to charge it
