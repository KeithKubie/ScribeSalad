00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.629
 in this capsule we will see how we 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:07.830
 can calculate different probability to 

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:10.410
 from a psn network we saw that a 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:13.950
 Bezian network that corresponds to a 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:16.920
 all of us c there are 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:21.990
 organized in a graph a serious one that 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:25.199
 is oriented in this case the arcs of 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:27.000
 my perfect graph but determine the 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:28.800
 properties of the probability tables 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.579
 conditional between these different 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:34.890
 variables and the probabilities of the tables 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:36.780
 conditional are specified in 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:38.820
 inside the Béziers network no it's 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:42.390
 another part the information that 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:44.309
 was giving the inside of network b if we 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:47.700
 continue we have hours when the 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:49.469
 knots and it's a law and bows 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:51.480
 inputs does not allow to determine the 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:53.219
 size of the probabilities of the tables of 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:54.539
 conditional policy then the value 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:55.949
 of these probabilities is also 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:01:01.590
 something that must be specified in 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:04.589
 a network bezily start with the calculation 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:06.090
 of politics can be the most fun 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:08.549
 are the joint probabilities 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:11.280
 so in fact a bezier network this is a 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:12.659
 compact way of representing these 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:15.150
 joint policies there it is a way 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:18.270
 more compact to represent them than under 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:20.009
 the shape of a table where we at the last 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:23.310
 column fits enjoy and each 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:25.080
 row corresponds to different 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:26.700
 joint policies for all 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:28.009
 possible configurations of our variables 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:30.780
 random 

00:01:28.009 --> 00:01:32.700
 we have seen that by definition a small 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:35.280
 recall the joint producti of two 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:37.439
 random variables x1 x2 thin and the 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:38.850
 probability so his blue fingers 

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:42.170
 take different mistakes at the same 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:44.970
 time we also saw that the pole tes 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:48.600
 conditional x hours knowing ex-dl 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:50.520
 that we note or leave so from 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:52.799
 to shelter conditional ex by knowing 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:55.110
 x2 but it's not possible to rewrite 

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:57.360
 joint probity etc. 110.2 as 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:58.950
 being the product of parity 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:02.369
 the first variable sacha the second 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:03.439
 times the probability of marginal the 

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:06.600
 second variable 

00:02:03.439 --> 00:02:10.590
 we could also have written that as 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:13.030
 stamps and 2 x 2 knowing ex 1 xp 2 x 1 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:15.220
 so we can do it in both directions 

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:17.319
 so in general we know that the 

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:19.650
 joint probabilities can only be 

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:21.640
 decomposed as local probabilities 

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:23.980
 marginal condition between 

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:26.350
 barriers to the web in a network 

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:28.900
 beziers what are we going to see specifically 

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:30.670
 know that the marginal probability in 

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:32.680
 all the variables in my network 

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:34.600
 beziers this is going to be the product of 

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:35.950
 conditional probabilities precisely 

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:39.850
 and the conditional probabilities that 

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:42.340
 will be the one determined by or defined 

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:44.410
 by my conditional quality tables 

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:46.720
 so that's going to be the priorities of each 

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:49.570
 exquisite random variables being 

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:51.220
 given the parents of my variable 

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:52.810
 random xxi no i'm going to do the 

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:55.330
 product everything is not useful it's going me 

00:02:52.810 --> 00:03:02.050
 give the joint probability for 

00:02:55.330 --> 00:03:04.720
 everything but variable to you now we 

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:07.209
 will make the parallel between the rule of 

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:08.260
 chaining we saw previously for 

00:03:07.209 --> 00:03:11.980
 for the probabilities 

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:14.170
 we have seen that the joint probability of 

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:16.390
 a random variable it can always 

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:17.860
 written as being the product of 

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:20.110
 priorities of each of the variables 

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:21.670
 random and xi knowing all the 

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:23.290
 previous random variables 

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:25.630
 so I defined a variable order 

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:27.610
 random then there i can set the 

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:28.780
 joint joint probability on any 

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:30.940
 but random variable as being the 

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:32.769
 produces conditional policies of 

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:35.079
 each variable its dear the one that 

00:03:32.769 --> 00:03:37.060
 precedes in my order now 

00:03:35.079 --> 00:03:38.200
 make the parallel with their calculations 

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:41.859
 joint network policy 

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:43.540
 beziers we have that joint probability 

00:03:41.859 --> 00:03:45.160
 this is again the product the 

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:47.560
 conditional output product but 

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:50.530
 when if it's political, it's 

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:52.510
 6 pm in just the parents so 

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:56.130
 firstly we only have this 

00:03:52.510 --> 00:04:00.340
 exactly the same formula as this here if 

00:03:56.130 --> 00:04:01.840
 by a deck ci corresponds to all 

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:06.340
 previous random variables 

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:09.819
 so if I replace with xi by g 

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:11.800
 exactly the same formula and we can 

00:04:09.819 --> 00:04:13.480
 so in fact conclude that in a network 

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:16.299
 beziers we have that these policies 

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:19.030
 conditional there can be written under 

00:04:16.299 --> 00:04:21.519
 this form there whatever the 

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:24.760
 parents as defined in my serious 

00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:27.280
 and so that means in fact that knowing 

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:29.710
 my parents the eksi policy does not 

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:32.010
 depends more on other variables that 

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:35.590
 do not belong to xxi's parents 

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:38.350
 and our ways of thinking that in fact my 

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:39.910
 bezier network will finally define me 

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:44.470
 implicitly independence 

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:46.900
 conditional so eksi labs 

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:48.580
 is independent of all others 

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:49.990
 random variables that do not belong 

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:52.440
 not to parents 

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:54.790
 given these parents there and so 

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:57.100
 using the structure of the Bézian network 

00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:59.410
 I have implicitly different 

00:04:57.100 --> 00:05:04.870
 of conditional independence which are 

00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:05.830
 defined let's do the example of the calculation of 

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:08.470
 joint policy 

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:09.880
 so I have the formula here for a network 

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:10.840
 bezers parents of the calculation of 

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:12.430
 joint probabilities 

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:14.770
 now that I'm going to calculate the 

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:17.820
 joint probability on your in my 

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:20.650
 example i call marie call alarm 

00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:22.539
 burglaries and earthquake and probity 

00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:23.800
 specifically the case where I will sign 

00:05:22.539 --> 00:05:28.960
 respectively these random variables 

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:32.010
 the aaf would dream fresh fake fake according to the 

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:35.169
 formula is the probability of 

00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:38.590
 people call sasha are parents who at 

00:05:35.169 --> 00:05:41.289
 both the quality of marries her song 

00:05:38.590 --> 00:05:44.139
 parents who also alarm the probability 

00:05:41.289 --> 00:05:47.130
 of his alarm chased by a burglary 

00:05:44.139 --> 00:05:50.020
 and earthquake for the pole your two 

00:05:47.130 --> 00:05:51.610
 burglaries sacha his parents in this 

00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:54.490
 case if there is not so it's the politi 

00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:57.880
 a priori of burglaries times the 

00:05:54.490 --> 00:05:59.710
 a priori earthquake policy 

00:05:57.880 --> 00:06:01.060
 now I consult my tables of 

00:05:59.710 --> 00:06:03.300
 take advantage to replace all these 

00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:05.440
 probabilities their share their value so 

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:06.880
 if you do the exercise of seeing them 

00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:10.500
 that these ninety percent 

00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:14.050
 seventy for that point a reason to 

00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:16.870
 99.9 for that and 98.8 for that so we 

00:06:14.050 --> 00:06:18.340
 notice that these two last here in 

00:06:16.870 --> 00:06:22.270
 did I got them 

00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:27.240
 because this figure c1 - parity 

00:06:22.270 --> 00:06:30.880
 to be assigned Le Havre who 0.001 

00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:36.040
 right here check the grading I get 

00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:38.350
 points 99 8 by doing 1 - 0 points 0 0 2 

00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:41.440
 so I make the product of all this and then 

00:06:38.350 --> 00:06:43.660
 it gives me that seems to me get the 

00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:45.699
 calculation of my joint probity on everything 

00:06:43.660 --> 00:06:48.639
 but random variable for a 

00:06:45.699 --> 00:06:50.790
 specific assignment of these variables 

00:06:48.639 --> 00:06:50.790
 random 

00:06:52.979 --> 00:06:58.990
 ok now let's move on to calculating 

00:06:56.260 --> 00:07:01.600
 marginal probabilities so a reminder the 

00:06:58.990 --> 00:07:03.130
 marginal policies it's policies 

00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:03.940
 welcomed on a subset of but 

00:07:03.130 --> 00:07:06.490
 random variable 

00:07:03.940 --> 00:07:09.250
 for example I could be interested in 

00:07:06.490 --> 00:07:13.229
 the marginal policy that there is no 

00:07:09.250 --> 00:07:15.760
 burglaries but that the blade sounds 

00:07:13.229 --> 00:07:18.639
 so in this case I should summit 

00:07:15.760 --> 00:07:20.260
 about the possible values ​​of others 

00:07:18.639 --> 00:07:23.830
 random commodities that are not observed 

00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:25.450
 so who passed or 1 to know the 

00:07:23.830 --> 00:07:27.610
 political deserves it 

00:07:25.450 --> 00:07:29.639
 the proof by which the value is yours 

00:07:27.610 --> 00:07:33.100
 marie calls the random variable 

00:07:29.639 --> 00:07:36.070
 earthquake is the random variable I had 

00:07:33.100 --> 00:07:38.979
 so I'm napping on all 

00:07:36.070 --> 00:07:40.389
 sgm values ​​possible from these others 

00:07:38.979 --> 00:07:42.580
 random variables are for observing 

00:07:40.389 --> 00:07:44.470
 so marked in that if I have a 

00:07:42.580 --> 00:07:46.960
 more complicated than we saw 

00:07:44.470 --> 00:07:49.240
 to spare a triple jump I have a 

00:07:46.960 --> 00:07:53.410
 sum on variables mjs 

00:07:49.240 --> 00:07:55.450
 so m are on mcm will take value 

00:07:53.410 --> 00:07:57.880
 true or false j will take their bike must 

00:07:55.450 --> 00:07:59.800
 s going to take the busy at the bottom so I 

00:07:57.880 --> 00:08:06.940
 do twice twice 2 so eight 

00:07:59.800 --> 00:08:09.190
 themes in this summation here ok so 

00:08:06.940 --> 00:08:11.650
 first thing that we take my 

00:08:09.190 --> 00:08:14.969
 joint probability here then I'm going 

00:08:11.650 --> 00:08:16.649
 convert it to there 

00:08:14.969 --> 00:08:19.079
 with the joint priority setting 

00:08:16.649 --> 00:08:22.319
 in a Bezier network we produced 

00:08:19.079 --> 00:08:25.499
 probabilities extracted from the tam de 

00:08:22.319 --> 00:08:30.089
 probity conditioned so that gives me pdj 

00:08:25.499 --> 00:08:35.279
 to get rid of purchases at the purchase price c and 

00:08:30.089 --> 00:08:36.990
 2 c is s follows a trick I want 

00:08:35.279 --> 00:08:38.519
 to do is I'm going to change the order 

00:08:36.990 --> 00:08:40.519
 half summons because I had a 

00:08:38.519 --> 00:08:42.779
 summation on m 

00:08:40.519 --> 00:08:45.240
 apart from the actually I had a 

00:08:42.779 --> 00:08:47.689
 safe solution followed by interventions 

00:08:45.240 --> 00:08:51.720
 on j followed by training on m 

00:08:47.689 --> 00:08:52.829
 and therefore a property of the summations and 

00:08:51.720 --> 00:08:54.750
 lighter like that is that I can 

00:08:52.829 --> 00:08:57.300
 change their orders without changing the 

00:08:54.750 --> 00:08:59.490
 result among other things the summit on 

00:08:57.300 --> 00:09:02.129
 a first mast that after that but arises 

00:08:59.490 --> 00:09:03.810
 finally summit would be this so 

00:09:02.129 --> 00:09:06.779
 and we will see later the shark 

00:09:03.810 --> 00:09:08.370
 advantage of doing that so it's all 

00:09:06.779 --> 00:09:11.209
 that I changed otherwise I just changed 

00:09:08.370 --> 00:09:11.209
 the order of summations 

00:09:11.600 --> 00:09:19.529
 now we notice that in this 

00:09:15.750 --> 00:09:21.449
 product of five values ​​here here there are some 

00:09:19.529 --> 00:09:24.800
 a single hell of these factors that 

00:09:21.449 --> 00:09:27.209
 depends on the variable m 

00:09:24.800 --> 00:09:28.709
 actually I got m here but otherwise 

00:09:27.209 --> 00:09:32.279
 in the term waters I have no m 

00:09:28.709 --> 00:09:36.389
 and because of the property of 

00:09:32.279 --> 00:09:43.259
 distributive it and therefore product by 

00:09:36.389 --> 00:09:45.329
 example if I have twice 3 + 2 x 4 

00:09:43.259 --> 00:09:52.199
 the judgment of ten of the victims tell me that 

00:09:45.329 --> 00:09:54.149
 it's also equal to 2 x 3 + 4 so I 

00:09:52.199 --> 00:09:57.750
 can invoke this rule to make it 

00:09:54.149 --> 00:10:01.439
 take out all the terms here the factors 

00:09:57.750 --> 00:10:03.029
 which does not depend on m in front of the sum m 

00:10:01.439 --> 00:10:03.899
 or in another way I can introduce 

00:10:03.029 --> 00:10:06.750
 the sum 

00:10:03.899 --> 00:10:08.339
 m for all purposes then put here only 

00:10:06.750 --> 00:10:09.389
 terms that depend on m 

00:10:08.339 --> 00:10:12.209
 so that's what I did to this 

00:10:09.389 --> 00:10:16.189
 language if I took my tempo 2nd sacha 

00:10:12.209 --> 00:10:19.830
 on an equal v can I go right push 

00:10:16.189 --> 00:10:21.240
 the order of 

00:10:19.830 --> 00:10:22.770
 evidence of the factors in my 

00:10:21.240 --> 00:10:23.940
 product is not important i can them 

00:10:22.770 --> 00:10:26.120
 changed so I can put it to the whole 

00:10:23.940 --> 00:10:29.730
 end and there I can push the sum on m 

00:10:26.120 --> 00:10:31.830
 up to knowing p2m and then put 

00:10:29.730 --> 00:10:35.220
 before all the other terms that was 

00:10:31.830 --> 00:10:37.470
 constant with respect to the variable m 

00:10:35.220 --> 00:10:39.180
 so it's just an application of the 

00:10:37.470 --> 00:10:41.910
 distributive rule love you applied 

00:10:39.180 --> 00:10:45.990
 on a number of term inhabitants in 

00:10:41.910 --> 00:10:47.550
 a sum ok so because all this does not 

00:10:45.990 --> 00:10:51.240
 does not depend on m I can put them in 

00:10:47.550 --> 00:10:55.010
 before and I can x the sum on m 

00:10:51.240 --> 00:10:55.010
 only terms that depend on m 

00:10:55.400 --> 00:11:00.920
 now we notice that this sum 

00:10:58.110 --> 00:11:04.140
 there here on m6 a sum on a single 

00:11:00.920 --> 00:11:06.060
 Probability distribution policy 

00:11:04.140 --> 00:11:07.950
 that they conditional and since I'm doing 

00:11:06.060 --> 00:11:09.120
 the sum on m 

00:11:07.950 --> 00:11:11.010
 which is the theme on which we evaluate 

00:11:09.120 --> 00:11:11.820
 probabilities this sum the customs 

00:11:11.010 --> 00:11:14.580
 I do not care 

00:11:11.820 --> 00:11:16.800
 because it's probabilities so I 

00:11:14.580 --> 00:11:19.050
 will have a liver several terms here 

00:11:16.800 --> 00:11:22.250
 so I can just bar this 

00:11:19.050 --> 00:11:24.390
 part of my equation 

00:11:22.250 --> 00:11:26.160
 now I continue to do that so 

00:11:24.390 --> 00:11:29.400
 I notice here that I have only one term 

00:11:26.160 --> 00:11:30.780
 who's leaving to all the others here 

00:11:29.400 --> 00:11:34.530
 do not depend on j so i can them 

00:11:30.780 --> 00:11:35.400
 push ahead of the sum pops up so 

00:11:34.530 --> 00:11:38.640
 pushed right 

00:11:35.400 --> 00:11:41.370
 mason popped up again this is a 

00:11:38.640 --> 00:11:43.500
 man arises from the probity of knowing me 

00:11:41.370 --> 00:11:45.630
 to the sums due by haiti must is 

00:11:43.500 --> 00:11:47.700
 equals stationery so I prepared this 

00:11:45.630 --> 00:11:51.120
 part of my product there is nothing left 

00:11:47.700 --> 00:11:53.370
 just these terms here here now we 

00:11:51.120 --> 00:11:56.490
 note houses a sum on sc the age is 

00:11:53.370 --> 00:11:59.880
 more than a term that starts from 

00:11:56.490 --> 00:12:01.350
 I have this term here and then this term 

00:11:59.880 --> 00:12:03.510
 here then unfortunately it turns out 

00:12:01.350 --> 00:12:05.270
 in the conditioning part you so I 

00:12:03.510 --> 00:12:10.360
 could not do the trick 

00:12:05.270 --> 00:12:12.579
 I get a sum who who are 1 

00:12:10.360 --> 00:12:16.149
 I could still take this term 

00:12:12.579 --> 00:12:18.550
 does not conceal sent forward but for 

00:12:16.149 --> 00:12:22.510
 to make it simpler I will spend everything from 

00:12:18.550 --> 00:12:23.649
 following an explicit form on the sum 

00:12:22.510 --> 00:12:26.800
 on it ie I'm going 

00:12:23.649 --> 00:12:28.870
 take my three terms here and then I 

00:12:26.800 --> 00:12:31.390
 will replace s by its first value 

00:12:28.870 --> 00:12:33.519
 which is true anymore 

00:12:31.390 --> 00:12:37.860
 again these three terms here 

00:12:33.519 --> 00:12:40.240
 but where is it going to be assigned to must 

00:12:37.860 --> 00:12:42.399
 now I replace all of his 

00:12:40.240 --> 00:12:43.779
 tesla products by their values 

00:12:42.399 --> 00:12:48.490
 associated in my tables of 

00:12:43.779 --> 00:12:49.570
 probabilities so here here here is the 

00:12:48.490 --> 00:12:53.019
 three terms of policies that I have 

00:12:49.570 --> 00:12:53.829
 need and I'm going to product then that's me 

00:12:53.019 --> 00:12:55.779
 give my answer 

00:12:53.829 --> 00:13:00.730
 so that gives me my calculation of 

00:12:55.779 --> 00:13:03.870
 marginal probabilities then we saw 

00:13:00.730 --> 00:13:07.870
 that the marginal probability for 

00:13:03.870 --> 00:13:10.600
 burglary and to the soul that normally 

00:13:07.870 --> 00:13:12.550
 if we use the laterites base 

00:13:10.600 --> 00:13:16.630
 priorities should require a sum 

00:13:12.550 --> 00:13:18.550
 on mjs it could be reduced for 

00:13:16.630 --> 00:13:20.860
 to get a form where we had a sum 

00:13:18.550 --> 00:13:23.320
 only on is so only on the 

00:13:20.860 --> 00:13:27.180
 random variable earthquake I made a 

00:13:23.320 --> 00:13:30.010
 mathematical proof of that but actually 

00:13:27.180 --> 00:13:32.430
 we have a rule that we can 

00:13:30.010 --> 00:13:36.160
 invoke that just allows observing 

00:13:32.430 --> 00:13:38.800
 the graphical structure between the nodes 

00:13:36.160 --> 00:13:41.560
 in winter moratorium to eliminate the clashes 

00:13:38.800 --> 00:13:43.480
 who have not be involved in the calculation 

00:13:41.560 --> 00:13:46.600
 this rule said that it is possible 

00:13:43.480 --> 00:13:48.430
 we can ignore the clouds 

00:13:46.600 --> 00:13:51.279
 calculation of probabilities marginal can 

00:13:48.430 --> 00:13:53.529
 ignore leonard and descendants forgive 

00:13:51.279 --> 00:13:56.470
 dummies whose descendants are only 

00:13:53.529 --> 00:13:58.630
 not to observe us then in our 

00:13:56.470 --> 00:14:01.720
 example we managed one and I call 

00:13:58.630 --> 00:14:03.010
 and marries call and if we apply the 

00:14:01.720 --> 00:14:05.470
 rule but actually we observed 

00:14:03.010 --> 00:14:07.079
 that I call a town hall called they 

00:14:05.470 --> 00:14:09.610
 do not have in their descendants 

00:14:07.079 --> 00:14:10.959
 burglaries and burglaries and 

00:14:09.610 --> 00:14:12.370
 the soul is the two variables that are 

00:14:10.959 --> 00:14:13.000
 observed for which one evaluates 

00:14:12.370 --> 00:14:14.860
 probabilities 

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:16.630
 so actually part of people 

00:14:14.860 --> 00:14:18.100
 call I can not follow arches in 

00:14:16.630 --> 00:14:20.260
 done there is no art clokey them 

00:14:18.100 --> 00:14:23.110
 descendants I can not follow art that 

00:14:20.260 --> 00:14:23.680
 would allow me to get to burglary 

00:14:23.110 --> 00:14:26.649
 or 

00:14:23.680 --> 00:14:27.760
 alarmed variable observed in reverse in 

00:14:26.649 --> 00:14:31.120
 the earthquake case 

00:14:27.760 --> 00:14:34.480
 six years as direct descendants alarm 

00:14:31.120 --> 00:14:36.550
 which is one of the variables observe and at 

00:14:34.480 --> 00:14:38.680
 because of that we can not simply 

00:14:36.550 --> 00:14:41.230
 ignore it when calculating 

00:14:38.680 --> 00:14:42.670
 marginal probabilities when it wants 

00:14:41.230 --> 00:14:44.320
 to say that in fact we can look at 

00:14:42.670 --> 00:14:47.080
 our network beziers then if we have a 

00:14:44.320 --> 00:14:49.149
 marginal policy has calculated on 

00:14:47.080 --> 00:14:50.800
 random variables observed but what 

00:14:49.149 --> 00:14:54.040
 I can do it's just ignored 

00:14:50.800 --> 00:14:55.660
 the nine that matches that they 

00:14:54.040 --> 00:14:56.860
 respect this rule to those whose 

00:14:55.660 --> 00:14:59.350
 descendants are not names 

00:14:56.860 --> 00:15:01.930
 observed then do my pole calculations 

00:14:59.350 --> 00:15:04.060
 marginal only from the 

00:15:01.930 --> 00:15:05.170
 other variables so only the 

00:15:04.060 --> 00:15:08.170
 other cables that are either 

00:15:05.170 --> 00:15:13.270
 variables observe or variables that 

00:15:08.170 --> 00:15:14.470
 I failed to eliminate and finally 

00:15:13.270 --> 00:15:17.190
 as regards the calculation of 

00:15:14.470 --> 00:15:17.190
 conditional probabilities 

00:15:17.370 --> 00:15:22.360
 since khalid clips are 

00:15:20.200 --> 00:15:24.130
 conditional it's just a ratio 

00:15:22.360 --> 00:15:25.839
 between marginal or 

00:15:24.130 --> 00:15:28.120
 joint so to enjoy an event 

00:15:25.839 --> 00:15:31.630
 knowing of events b it's always 

00:15:28.120 --> 00:15:33.850
 the parity of a and b so the event has 

00:15:31.630 --> 00:15:36.940
 and b at the same time divided by parity 

00:15:33.850 --> 00:15:38.650
 marginal of the event b so 

00:15:36.940 --> 00:15:41.020
 and since we are able to 

00:15:38.650 --> 00:15:44.500
 calculate marginal pro liter or 

00:15:41.020 --> 00:15:45.640
 conjunctions in a Bézian network but I 

00:15:44.500 --> 00:15:48.220
 am able to calculate all 

00:15:45.640 --> 00:15:49.089
 conditional policies possible that 

00:15:48.220 --> 00:15:51.220
 could interest me 

00:15:49.089 --> 00:15:54.490
 I can get the formula to do 

00:15:51.220 --> 00:15:56.770
 this calculation does not know what we are going to sell 

00:15:54.490 --> 00:15:58.420
 the following capsules is that the 

00:15:56.770 --> 00:16:00.550
 benefits of the Bezier networks still a 

00:15:58.420 --> 00:16:01.480
 times it's going to be from its structure 

00:16:00.550 --> 00:16:03.850
 in serious it's going to be possible 

00:16:01.480 --> 00:16:05.850
 to identify independence 

00:16:03.850 --> 00:16:10.270
 conditional ie to identify 

00:16:05.850 --> 00:16:11.740
 variables that I can eliminate 

00:16:10.270 --> 00:16:13.240
 my calculation of policies 

00:16:11.740 --> 00:16:15.400
 conditional because they are 

00:16:13.240 --> 00:16:16.750
 conditioning is dependent on the 

00:16:15.400 --> 00:16:18.610
 variable for which I calculate a 

00:16:16.750 --> 00:16:21.850
 conditioned priority to see 

00:16:18.610 --> 00:16:24.850
 different rules to facilitate this 

00:16:21.850 --> 00:16:26.620
 kind of calculation there and identify 

00:16:24.850 --> 00:16:28.540
 functional independence in the 

00:16:26.620 --> 00:16:30.670
 next capsules and that's fine 

00:16:28.540 --> 00:16:32.110
 actually allow to reduce the calculations 

00:16:30.670 --> 00:16:34.680
 to do for the calculation of these 

00:16:32.110 --> 00:16:34.680
 conditional probabilities
