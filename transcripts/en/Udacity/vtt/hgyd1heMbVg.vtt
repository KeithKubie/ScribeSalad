00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.294
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; We know an ordered pair is always x, and then y. So for this first ordered

00:00:04.294 --> 00:00:08.782
pair, I move one unit to the right from the origin, and then two units down. One

00:00:08.782 --> 00:00:13.120
unit right, two units down. That's C. For the second one, I move one unit left

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:17.668
of the origin, and then two units down. That must be B. For the third choice, I

00:00:17.668 --> 00:00:22.020
have to move two units right, and then one unit down. Two units to the right of

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:26.622
the origin. And then one unit down, so answer choice D. This, of course, leaves

00:00:26.622 --> 00:00:30.828
us with the last one, which is A. We move two units left, for negative 2, and

00:00:30.828 --> 00:00:35.059
then one unit up. If you got all these right, great work on this quiz. And if

00:00:35.059 --> 00:00:39.472
you didn't get all of them right, think about which ones gave you trouble. Keep

00:00:39.472 --> 00:00:43.831
in mind which direction you should move first, right or left. And then, up or

00:00:43.831 --> 00:00:44.191
down.
