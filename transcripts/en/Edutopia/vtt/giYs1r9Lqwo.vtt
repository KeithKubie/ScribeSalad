00:00:11.566 --> 00:00:15.336
&gt;&gt;Linda: When you think about how
you want to educate the whole child,

00:00:15.386 --> 00:00:21.596
it's critical to be sure that you're
helping kids be able to engage

00:00:21.596 --> 00:00:25.716
with one another, understand
themselves and how they think,

00:00:26.476 --> 00:00:29.656
be able to handle the stresses
and challenges in their lives

00:00:29.656 --> 00:00:32.156
which are increasing all of the time.

00:00:32.686 --> 00:00:36.926
Kids today come in many cases from
very challenging environments.

00:00:37.676 --> 00:00:43.946
So it's impossible really to focus on
preparing teachers, preparing leaders

00:00:43.946 --> 00:00:46.696
for public schools without dealing
with social and emotional learning

00:00:47.096 --> 00:00:49.676
as well as academic learning if
they're going to be effective.

00:00:49.676 --> 00:00:53.206
In the work we do in
teacher education we build

00:00:53.206 --> 00:00:57.556
in social emotional learning into
adolescent development courses,

00:00:58.006 --> 00:01:01.466
into learning theory
courses, really in a variety

00:01:01.466 --> 00:01:06.226
of ways throughout the program
not only for teachers to learn how

00:01:06.336 --> 00:01:11.186
to help students get along with
one another, develop socials skills

00:01:11.186 --> 00:01:14.516
and emotional skills, but also to
help teachers and leaders figure

00:01:14.516 --> 00:01:20.396
out how to support themselves
as social emotional learners.

00:01:20.796 --> 00:01:24.196
It's a very, very intense
kind of work.

00:01:24.966 --> 00:01:30.916
You have to be able to relate well to
a variety of kids and other adults.

00:01:31.396 --> 00:01:35.636
You have to be able to manage
relationships on an ongoing basis.

00:01:35.636 --> 00:01:40.726
You have to be able to calm yourself
and be deliberative in working

00:01:40.726 --> 00:01:43.526
in situations that are
very unpredictable.

00:01:44.296 --> 00:01:47.786
And the best teachers in
fact I believe are very

00:01:47.786 --> 00:01:48.886
emotionally intelligent.

00:01:49.346 --> 00:01:52.046
They're very socially intelligent
and the same thing is true

00:01:52.046 --> 00:01:54.316
for school principals
and school leaders.

00:01:54.736 --> 00:02:00.356
So I think this work around
how we understand ourselves,

00:02:00.426 --> 00:02:04.836
how we understand others, how we
work together is sort of at the core

00:02:04.836 --> 00:02:06.726
of so many aspects of education.

00:02:10.376 --> 00:02:13.386
&gt;&gt;The other piece that I think is
critically important in addition

00:02:13.386 --> 00:02:18.046
to preparing people to do this
work in the classroom is thinking

00:02:18.046 --> 00:02:19.926
about how we design schools

00:02:20.646 --> 00:02:23.186
so that they are developmentally
healthy places.

00:02:24.356 --> 00:02:28.976
You can't just plunk this kind of
work down in the middle of a school

00:02:28.976 --> 00:02:33.826
that is antithetical to
good human relationships.

00:02:34.766 --> 00:02:38.826
Schools need to be places where
strong relationships can form.

00:02:39.326 --> 00:02:43.476
&gt;&gt;That's not the environment
that we have at all schools.

00:02:43.476 --> 00:02:47.716
We are still struggling to get
past the factory model school

00:02:47.716 --> 00:02:53.696
that we inherited in the early 1900s
which adopted age grading so kids go

00:02:53.696 --> 00:02:55.366
to different teachers every year.

00:02:56.136 --> 00:02:58.756
In the middle and high schools
they go to different teachers

00:02:58.756 --> 00:03:00.876
in many cases every 45 minutes.

00:03:01.696 --> 00:03:06.826
Teachers have 150 or 180 or
200 kids a day in this model.

00:03:07.856 --> 00:03:10.266
And much of the environment
particularly

00:03:10.266 --> 00:03:16.836
in big urban factory model schools
is punitive and coercive because it's

00:03:16.836 --> 00:03:20.706
about control of large
numbers of people being asked

00:03:20.796 --> 00:03:22.526
to do things that are not natural.

00:03:23.476 --> 00:03:26.616
So we've got to redesign schools
and people are working on this

00:03:27.046 --> 00:03:30.346
to create smaller environments that
are more personalized where adults

00:03:30.346 --> 00:03:33.206
and kids stay together
over periods of time,

00:03:33.206 --> 00:03:37.706
where teams of teachers can work
with each other around the needs

00:03:37.706 --> 00:03:40.586
of the kids as well as
with the kids directly.

00:03:44.726 --> 00:03:47.296
&gt;&gt;Often when we think about social
and emotional learning we think

00:03:47.296 --> 00:03:51.056
about teaching kids
skills of interaction

00:03:51.206 --> 00:03:53.716
and skills of self-management.

00:03:54.346 --> 00:03:57.196
We don't always think about
the ways in which that kind

00:03:57.196 --> 00:04:01.286
of learning comes together with a
particular kind of teaching strategy.

00:04:01.886 --> 00:04:05.276
But if you think about the ways
in which we have to be able

00:04:05.336 --> 00:04:09.616
to be functioning adults, it's in
contexts where we work in groups

00:04:10.116 --> 00:04:15.056
on hard problems that
need creative solutions

00:04:15.506 --> 00:04:17.096
that require problem solving.

00:04:17.356 --> 00:04:22.526
And it's getting to do that work well
that is really part of the major goal

00:04:22.526 --> 00:04:24.466
of education in the 21st century.

00:04:25.266 --> 00:04:29.396
So when you think about project-based
learning, learning that results

00:04:29.496 --> 00:04:34.256
in demonstrations of performance,
exhibitions of what kids can do

00:04:34.686 --> 00:04:40.146
in real tasks that have brought these
kind of novel challenges to them

00:04:40.206 --> 00:04:44.836
to solve, you can see that when
an individual student or a group

00:04:44.836 --> 00:04:48.796
of students come together to solve
a hard problem to figure out how

00:04:48.796 --> 00:04:51.856
to do research, how to do
inquiry, how to investigate,

00:04:52.216 --> 00:04:54.906
how to put their ideas together,

00:04:55.266 --> 00:04:58.606
how to figure out which ideas
have the most grounding,

00:04:58.606 --> 00:05:02.216
how to present what they've
done, they have to do a lot

00:05:02.216 --> 00:05:06.236
of socially intelligent work.

00:05:06.606 --> 00:05:10.756
They have to be able to figure
out how to relate to one another,

00:05:10.756 --> 00:05:15.406
how to divide tests, how to solve
problems, how to probably run

00:05:15.406 --> 00:05:20.766
into dead ends, pick up the pieces,
reorient and go in a new direction.

00:05:21.136 --> 00:05:27.406
All of that develops children's
abilities to be socially capable,

00:05:28.116 --> 00:05:30.846
emotionally capable and grounded,

00:05:31.346 --> 00:05:36.176
and in the long run also
intellectually capable.

00:05:36.676 --> 00:05:39.586
And those pieces all come
together when you're working

00:05:39.586 --> 00:05:43.596
on project-based experiential
learning activities.

00:05:47.606 --> 00:05:51.926
&gt;&gt;Some years ago in New York
City a group of educators began

00:05:52.046 --> 00:05:55.046
to redesign high schools.

00:05:55.046 --> 00:05:58.816
One of the very famous school
designers, Debbie Meier,

00:05:59.186 --> 00:06:01.216
had been initially a
kindergarten teacher

00:06:01.216 --> 00:06:04.266
and had designed several
elementary schools that were very,

00:06:04.266 --> 00:06:07.386
very successful, and then she
wanted to create a high school

00:06:07.686 --> 00:06:09.256
that those kids could go to.

00:06:09.926 --> 00:06:11.906
When she designed the first

00:06:12.196 --> 00:06:16.346
such model Central Park East
Secondary School she designed it

00:06:16.346 --> 00:06:19.066
so that teams of teachers would
work with the same group of kids

00:06:19.596 --> 00:06:21.116
over two years at a time.

00:06:21.806 --> 00:06:22.846
The kids would stay together.

00:06:22.846 --> 00:06:26.036
The teachers would have time to
plan around the needs of the kids.

00:06:26.456 --> 00:06:28.116
Every student has an advisor.

00:06:28.646 --> 00:06:32.606
Every advisor has about 15 kids that
they are personally responsible for.

00:06:33.046 --> 00:06:35.386
They meet with the parents
several times a year.

00:06:35.836 --> 00:06:40.786
The students learn how to become
responsible for their learning

00:06:40.786 --> 00:06:43.906
and their interactions with their
parents about their learning.

00:06:44.686 --> 00:06:49.696
Much of the work in school is
around teamwork and group work.

00:06:49.696 --> 00:06:53.446
Kids learn to work interactively
and they demonstrate their work

00:06:53.556 --> 00:06:54.796
through authentic assessments,

00:06:54.796 --> 00:06:57.096
performance-based learning
exhibitions and so

00:06:57.096 --> 00:07:02.296
on which give them the opportunity to
learn to be disciplined and organized

00:07:02.296 --> 00:07:05.436
and to persevere in the
face of challenges in a lot

00:07:05.436 --> 00:07:08.916
of the other aspects of emotional
development and social development

00:07:08.916 --> 00:07:09.946
that we need them to have.

00:07:10.506 --> 00:07:13.646
So that school actually became
one of a number of schools

00:07:13.686 --> 00:07:18.336
that were organized around those
features where kids were graduating

00:07:18.336 --> 00:07:23.176
at higher rates, where kids were
experiencing a much safer school

00:07:23.176 --> 00:07:26.016
environment where they were
more connected to school,

00:07:26.016 --> 00:07:29.526
more socially responsible,
taking more leadership roles.

00:07:30.106 --> 00:07:34.906
That movement really has evolved into
a small-schools movement nationwide.

00:07:35.336 --> 00:07:38.716
We've developed some schools in
the Bay Area in San Francisco

00:07:38.716 --> 00:07:42.976
that use the same kind of model
and they provide the opportunity

00:07:43.076 --> 00:07:49.296
for children to grow up feeling
confident, learning how to be members

00:07:49.296 --> 00:07:56.006
of a community, being engaged with
and thoughtful about their learning

00:07:56.476 --> 00:07:59.026
because they're doing
it in authentic ways

00:07:59.086 --> 00:08:03.256
that help them develop not only the
academic skills but also the skills

00:08:03.296 --> 00:08:08.866
of being independent, being
planful [sic], being purposeful,

00:08:08.866 --> 00:08:11.856
being able to mediate challenges.

00:08:12.386 --> 00:08:17.636
And these are the features of social,
emotional, and academic learning

00:08:17.866 --> 00:08:20.546
that people need when they go
into the world outside of school.

00:08:20.896 --> 00:08:25.426
And I think that when we think about
the whole system of education we have

00:08:25.476 --> 00:08:29.256
to put this kind of learning
at the heart of the system.

00:08:31.166 --> 00:08:33.126
