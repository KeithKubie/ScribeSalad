CHELSEA SEABRON: Good
evening, everybody.

00:00:01.710 --> 00:00:03.341
And welcome to Google New York.

00:00:03.341 --> 00:00:04.590
It's so great to see you guys.

00:00:04.590 --> 00:00:06.340
We've been preparing
for you for weeks,

00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:09.190
so it's awesome to
see you guys here.

00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:11.720
My name is Chelsea Seabron,
and it is my pleasure

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:15.410
to welcome you on behalf
of google.org who's

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:18.820
sponsoring this along with our
amazing partners to my left

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:22.030
here from HBO,
Participant Media.

00:00:22.030 --> 00:00:25.810
We have some members of the
3 and 1/2 Minutes, 10 Bullets

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:27.670
film team, as well with us.

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:31.140
So the culmination of
everybody here today

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:33.310
is because of
those partnerships.

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:36.160
So some of you may
be wondering why

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:38.420
is Google taking on this film?

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:40.510
Why are we here
talking about this?

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:44.250
And this journey ultimately
started about six months ago

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.450
through our
partnership with PICO.

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:49.600
And so, through PICO, we've
had opportunity of expanding

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:51.487
that relationship to HBO.

00:00:51.487 --> 00:00:53.070
And I would love for
you guys to stand

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:55.340
just so people can
see who you are

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:57.090
from HBO, Participant Media.

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.860
We've got Urban Cusp who's
a partnership that has come.

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:01.484
So let's give them
a round of applause.

00:01:01.484 --> 00:01:04.802
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:11.560
So pretty much this
partnership started

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:14.230
after the unfortunate
and very tragic

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:16.610
shootings that
happened in Charleston.

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:18.490
And, after that, that
was the first moment

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:21.810
as a Google community
that our various employee

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:25.220
groups came together and
said we have to do something.

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:27.500
We to come together
in solidarity.

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:30.490
And we ended up actually doing
a global-wide movement where

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:32.960
everyone wore "Black
Lives Matter" t-shirts

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:33.750
across the globe.

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:36.450
And we were posting
these via Google+.

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:40.160
And it was a beautiful day
where, for the first time,

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:43.090
we acknowledged what's going
on in our communities that

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:46.720
ultimately are affecting
each individual employee.

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:51.050
And so, after that
day, google.org

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:54.310
stepped up in a really huge
way and made a $5 million

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:56.720
investment in racial justice.

00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:59.740
So this is part of
that investment.

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:03.170
Since then, we've invested
half of that money

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:06.440
to organizations in the
Bay Area where I'm from.

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:09.289
And tonight you
guys are actually

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:12.120
the first to hear that the
last of that 2 and 1/2 million

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:13.770
will go out any day now.

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:15.340
So let's give it
up for google.org.

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:17.725
[APPLAUSE]

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:23.810
So my colleagues are back home.

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:26.510
They send their regards from
California, Justin Steele

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:28.922
and Jacquelline Fuller,
from google.org.

00:02:28.922 --> 00:02:30.630
And, thought they're
not physically here,

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:33.970
they're trying to get
those grants out the door.

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:37.720
So let's talk a little bit
about tonight's program.

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:40.500
And, as you can see, we've
got food and networking.

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:43.910
Hopefully you've met somebody
who doesn't look like you.

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:47.330
And tonight we really
are challenging everybody

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:49.700
to get a little uncomfortable.

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:51.420
And we salute
everybody in this room

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:56.120
because to take on the choice to
come here tonight was not easy.

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:58.140
Talking about race is not easy.

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:00.470
And so, you know, I
salute everybody here

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:08.730
for taking that decision
to be uncomfortable,

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:11.390
especially the topic
of tonight's film.

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:15.300
We have a lot of employees
who have felt their blackness.

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:17.630
And black and brown
men, especially,

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:21.310
have been stigmatized with
awful feelings or associations

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:23.524
of being violent or dangerous.

00:03:23.524 --> 00:03:24.940
And so tonight,
through this film,

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:27.510
we will explore this topic.

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:29.660
And I just want you guys
to understand and own

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:33.170
that we all have bias,
whether it's about race,

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:34.990
or religion, or anything else.

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:36.460
We all carry our own bias.

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:38.330
And so tonight we
just challenge you

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:42.700
to be uncomfortable, to own the
work we need to do within each

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:44.260
and every one of us.

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:47.430
And this is the first step
for you guys, just showing up.

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:50.150
So thank you for showing up.

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:51.090
So without-- oh.

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:52.010
[APPLAUSE]

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:52.600
Thanks, Ron.

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:53.740
[CHUCKLING]

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:00.350
And so, without
much further ado,

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:01.660
this is our final screening.

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:03.440
It's actually a
pretty sad moment

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:05.420
because I've been
traveling with Ron and Lucy

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:07.170
across the country.

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:10.200
Google did one of these in
Charleston, South Carolina.

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:11.920
We did a second one
in San Francisco

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:14.500
to an audience of
about 1,400 people.

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:18.029
And tonight is the final, first
time in New York, at that.

00:04:18.029 --> 00:04:20.170
But it's so beautiful
to see you all here

00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:23.320
because we've been on a
little journey, a big journey.

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:26.450
And Ron and Lucy have been
on a way longer journey.

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:30.780
So, to kind of kick off an
understanding of that journey,

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:32.950
let's welcome to the
stage Rahiel Tesfamariam,

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:34.870
founder of Urban Cusp--

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:36.850
[APPLAUSE]

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:42.550
And if you don't know about
Urban Cusp, you must find out.

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:46.260
Rahiel has done many things from
the "Not One Dime" campaign,

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:49.200
which hopefully on Black
Friday, no one shopped.

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:53.210
But if you did, Rahiel will
tell you why not to next year.

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:56.160
And, Ron and Lucy, if
you guys would also

00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:58.420
come to the stage and--

00:04:58.420 --> 00:05:01.880
[APPLAUSE]

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:07.290
So Ron and Lucy are the
parents of Jordan Davis who

00:05:07.290 --> 00:05:11.410
have just so bravely and
boldly relived this story time

00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:15.510
and time again to change the
hearts and minds of audience

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:17.520
members just like yourselves.

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:19.580
And so I guarantee
you I've known them

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:21.820
for about six months now.

00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:23.290
And they feel like family.

00:05:23.290 --> 00:05:25.500
And they have
challenged Googlers

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:28.150
the first time we met
that change starts

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:29.800
with each and every one of us.

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:32.390
And so I took that call very
seriously when they told me

00:05:32.390 --> 00:05:34.090
the first time.

00:05:34.090 --> 00:05:36.180
So I guarantee you you'll
fall in love with them

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:37.090
by the end of today.

00:05:37.090 --> 00:05:39.700
And I just really
honor their courage

00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:43.830
to tell this story over and
over again, despite that.

00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:46.090
And last, but
certainly not least,

00:05:46.090 --> 00:05:49.480
I want to make a plug for HBO.

00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:52.040
This is our only
post-production screening,

00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:54.430
but we had two
pre-production ones.

00:05:54.430 --> 00:05:56.550
But, really, cool
opportunity to get this word

00:05:56.550 --> 00:05:59.430
out even bigger than tonight
is to spread the word

00:05:59.430 --> 00:06:02.350
and get HBO if
you don't have it.

00:06:02.350 --> 00:06:07.000
And you can watch this film on
HBO, and all streaming devices,

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:08.310
and channels, as well.

00:06:08.310 --> 00:06:12.710
So, without further ado, I'll
turn it over to you guys.

00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:14.910
RAHIEL TESFAMARIAM: Thank
you so much, Chelsea.

00:06:14.910 --> 00:06:17.300
This is a wonderful
opportunity for me

00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:21.270
because I first saw the film
when Sue Patel showed it

00:06:21.270 --> 00:06:23.750
to me at a private screening.

00:06:23.750 --> 00:06:25.280
We were in director's chairs.

00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:28.550
And, being in a
huge, empty room,

00:06:28.550 --> 00:06:31.580
just crying my way through
the whole entire film.

00:06:31.580 --> 00:06:35.090
And, at that time, there
was no clear direction

00:06:35.090 --> 00:06:36.680
about what was going to happen.

00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:38.200
There was no HBO deal.

00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:41.390
It had not yet been
screened at Sundance.

00:06:41.390 --> 00:06:44.190
We were having discussions
about using Urban Cusp

00:06:44.190 --> 00:06:45.830
platform to screen it.

00:06:45.830 --> 00:06:48.550
And it was a very
grassroots discussion.

00:06:48.550 --> 00:06:52.910
And now to kind of see what
has happened with this film,

00:06:52.910 --> 00:06:56.780
to see that it has
aired on HBO, to see

00:06:56.780 --> 00:07:01.170
that it is on the short
list of Oscar nominations--

00:07:01.170 --> 00:07:04.680
I don't know if you
all knew that-- it

00:07:04.680 --> 00:07:07.720
is such a powerful
testament to what

00:07:07.720 --> 00:07:11.310
can be done with very little
when there is a will, when

00:07:11.310 --> 00:07:13.890
there is a desire, when
there is a clear purpose,

00:07:13.890 --> 00:07:16.100
and absolutely
with the strength,

00:07:16.100 --> 00:07:19.380
and resilience, and tenacity
of Jordan's parents.

00:07:19.380 --> 00:07:22.790
So I want to just personally
thank them for the example

00:07:22.790 --> 00:07:24.980
that they have set
for so many people.

00:07:24.980 --> 00:07:27.080
I've traveled, actually,
all over with them

00:07:27.080 --> 00:07:30.920
in different capacities
from Aspen to Memphis.

00:07:30.920 --> 00:07:32.570
We've been all over the country.

00:07:32.570 --> 00:07:36.600
And every single time, they
have the whole room in tears.

00:07:36.600 --> 00:07:40.430
They have people
completely inspired, eager

00:07:40.430 --> 00:07:42.360
to figure out what's next.

00:07:42.360 --> 00:07:44.590
And I think that
they always leave you

00:07:44.590 --> 00:07:49.780
with a sense of if they can
do this, then I have no excuse

00:07:49.780 --> 00:07:52.685
because they just move
with absolute resolve

00:07:52.685 --> 00:07:53.690
and conviction.

00:07:53.690 --> 00:07:56.960
And I just want to thank you
for who you are and especially

00:07:56.960 --> 00:07:58.230
at this moment in time.

00:07:58.230 --> 00:08:01.190
So, speaking to the
one year anniversary

00:08:01.190 --> 00:08:04.820
of Sandy Hook, everything that's
happening in this country,

00:08:04.820 --> 00:08:07.220
the discussion that we're
having about gun laws,

00:08:07.220 --> 00:08:10.920
and the discussion that we're
having about police brutality,

00:08:10.920 --> 00:08:14.870
this is such a timely film in
the context of all of that.

00:08:14.870 --> 00:08:16.240
And this is-- sorry.

00:08:16.240 --> 00:08:19.610
I'm recovering from a cold-- but
this is particularly the work

00:08:19.610 --> 00:08:22.440
that you're doing in
terms of gun legislation.

00:08:22.440 --> 00:08:24.064
Can you speak to
that a little bit?

00:08:24.064 --> 00:08:24.730
LUCY MCBATH: Oh.

00:08:24.730 --> 00:08:26.460
Thank you so much.

00:08:26.460 --> 00:08:28.986
And, once again, thank
you so much for inviting

00:08:28.986 --> 00:08:30.110
us to be here this evening.

00:08:30.110 --> 00:08:32.299
We're so excited.

00:08:32.299 --> 00:08:34.470
Yes, definitely so.

00:08:34.470 --> 00:08:39.299
I stay extremely busy
running from state to state

00:08:39.299 --> 00:08:43.600
and testifying across the
country on the opposition

00:08:43.600 --> 00:08:47.300
of the expansion of all of
the gun laws in the country,

00:08:47.300 --> 00:08:50.020
talking to our legislators,
and talking to civic leaders,

00:08:50.020 --> 00:08:53.560
and talking to academia,
talking to other grassroots

00:08:53.560 --> 00:08:57.560
organizations trying
to begin building

00:08:57.560 --> 00:09:01.410
coalitions of other grassroots
organizations and individuals

00:09:01.410 --> 00:09:04.390
that are concerned about what's
happening in the country.

00:09:04.390 --> 00:09:06.470
Believe it or not--
of course, we already

00:09:06.470 --> 00:09:08.230
know that in the
urban communities,

00:09:08.230 --> 00:09:10.560
this violence has
always been going on.

00:09:10.560 --> 00:09:14.025
And there have already been
established gun grassroots,

00:09:14.025 --> 00:09:17.410
gun violence organizations
that have been doing the work.

00:09:17.410 --> 00:09:21.690
So now my job is, as a national
spokesperson for Everytown

00:09:21.690 --> 00:09:24.960
for gun safety and also their
faith and community outreach

00:09:24.960 --> 00:09:28.100
leader, I go into
these communities.

00:09:28.100 --> 00:09:32.780
And I try to graph them into the
national work of gun violence

00:09:32.780 --> 00:09:37.040
prevention-- also within the
faith community, as well.

00:09:37.040 --> 00:09:41.976
So, as we say, we've become
the accidental activists.

00:09:41.976 --> 00:09:43.350
Neither one of us
would ever have

00:09:43.350 --> 00:09:47.960
imagined that we would be doing
this work, called to this work.

00:09:47.960 --> 00:09:50.230
But it is so relevant
for the time.

00:09:50.230 --> 00:09:52.200
It's so sorely needed.

00:09:52.200 --> 00:09:54.480
And this is what we
spend our time doing

00:09:54.480 --> 00:09:59.250
trying to encourage and engage
individuals and organizations

00:09:59.250 --> 00:10:02.540
in gun violence prevention
in the faith community

00:10:02.540 --> 00:10:04.195
and diverse communities.

00:10:04.195 --> 00:10:06.220
RAHIEL TESFAMARIAM: And
so you can follow up

00:10:06.220 --> 00:10:09.990
on urbancusp.com We just
released an article today

00:10:09.990 --> 00:10:12.940
written by [INAUDIBLE] Lucy.

00:10:12.940 --> 00:10:17.130
And the article kind of
speaks to America's claim

00:10:17.130 --> 00:10:21.980
to be this land of faith,
this place where we are driven

00:10:21.980 --> 00:10:24.490
by faith and love
of God's people,

00:10:24.490 --> 00:10:28.360
and how our legislation, our
policies, the racism that

00:10:28.360 --> 00:10:30.520
is enlivened in this
country at this moment

00:10:30.520 --> 00:10:33.160
is actually absolutely
contrary to what

00:10:33.160 --> 00:10:34.880
we say we are as a nation.

00:10:34.880 --> 00:10:36.796
So there's a very
powerful piece that I

00:10:36.796 --> 00:10:37.920
encourage you to check out.

00:10:37.920 --> 00:10:40.730
And I believe when the surveys
go out about the event,

00:10:40.730 --> 00:10:44.140
Chelsea will be sure to
send a link to the article.

00:10:44.140 --> 00:10:45.705
So, Uncle Ron--

00:10:45.705 --> 00:10:47.980
RON DAVIS: [CHUCKLING]
That's my niece.

00:10:47.980 --> 00:10:50.630
RAHIEL TESFAMARIAM:
We're family, absolutely.

00:10:50.630 --> 00:10:55.870
I've heard you speak a lot about
your evolution and opinions

00:10:55.870 --> 00:10:58.710
about how this film
and your experiences

00:10:58.710 --> 00:11:00.960
kind of relate to a
larger conversation that's

00:11:00.960 --> 00:11:05.000
happening about terrorism
and Islamophobia.

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:06.770
Can you speak to
some of those things?

00:11:06.770 --> 00:11:07.395
RON DAVIS: Yes.

00:11:10.430 --> 00:11:12.430
When you look at this
film, what we want to show

00:11:12.430 --> 00:11:14.120
is the families.

00:11:14.120 --> 00:11:16.440
Most of the time when you
see the major networks,

00:11:16.440 --> 00:11:20.390
they show the shooter,
and they show the victim.

00:11:20.390 --> 00:11:23.060
As most of the time you cannot
connect with the victim,

00:11:23.060 --> 00:11:27.305
you just start hearing they
had alcohol in their system.

00:11:27.305 --> 00:11:29.190
They had cocaine
in their system.

00:11:29.190 --> 00:11:32.980
They had weed in their
system constantly victimizing

00:11:32.980 --> 00:11:35.440
the victim all over again.

00:11:35.440 --> 00:11:37.330
You never hear
from the families.

00:11:37.330 --> 00:11:39.700
Every once in a while, they'll
pick a few family members

00:11:39.700 --> 00:11:40.950
to come out and say something.

00:11:40.950 --> 00:11:44.630
But, by in large, you don't
get the family members

00:11:44.630 --> 00:11:46.470
to tell the story
of their child,

00:11:46.470 --> 00:11:48.430
to tell the story
of their loved one.

00:11:48.430 --> 00:11:51.760
That's one of the reasons why
we allow the filmmakers to come

00:11:51.760 --> 00:11:53.670
into our home, to
come into our lives

00:11:53.670 --> 00:11:56.540
and make this film, "3 and
1/2 Minutes, 10 Bullets"

00:11:56.540 --> 00:12:01.800
to show when you take a
valuable life-- and all lives

00:12:01.800 --> 00:12:05.980
have value: black,
white, pink, whatever,

00:12:05.980 --> 00:12:09.550
no matter what your religion,
all lives have value.

00:12:09.550 --> 00:12:11.130
They have communities
that love them.

00:12:11.130 --> 00:12:12.504
They have friends
that love them.

00:12:12.504 --> 00:12:14.320
And they have family
that love them.

00:12:14.320 --> 00:12:16.490
And we want to show
that in this film.

00:12:16.490 --> 00:12:20.130
Most of the families out
here, they do not get justice.

00:12:20.130 --> 00:12:24.170
We were one of the few families
that got complete justice.

00:12:24.170 --> 00:12:26.710
When I say complete
justice, what I'm saying

00:12:26.710 --> 00:12:31.320
is first degree murder,
life imprisonment,

00:12:31.320 --> 00:12:34.250
no chance of parole.

00:12:34.250 --> 00:12:37.000
I'm talking-- you're
not hearing me.

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:39.930
I'm talking first degree
murder, life imprisonment,

00:12:39.930 --> 00:12:41.380
no chance of parole.

00:12:41.380 --> 00:12:44.380
Most of families don't
even get an indictment.

00:12:44.380 --> 00:12:45.890
We look in Chicago.

00:12:45.890 --> 00:12:49.950
They paid off the
family $5 million.

00:12:49.950 --> 00:12:54.060
Took 14 months to arrest
the guy that did something

00:12:54.060 --> 00:12:56.000
that they know was wrong.

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:58.920
You shoot the first two bullets,
and the man is on the ground.

00:12:58.920 --> 00:13:01.600
And you shoot 14 more
bullets so much so

00:13:01.600 --> 00:13:06.120
that it's kicking up
cement off the concrete.

00:13:06.120 --> 00:13:10.300
The mayor of the town, the city
managers, the superintendent,

00:13:10.300 --> 00:13:13.429
they all have seen the tape.

00:13:13.429 --> 00:13:14.220
But what do you do?

00:13:14.220 --> 00:13:16.800
You pay the families off,
even though they didn't even

00:13:16.800 --> 00:13:18.500
sue the city.

00:13:18.500 --> 00:13:20.020
Now if me and you
pay somebody off?

00:13:20.020 --> 00:13:20.769
What is it called?

00:13:20.769 --> 00:13:22.630
Bribery?

00:13:22.630 --> 00:13:24.960
We go to jail.

00:13:24.960 --> 00:13:27.625
Just firing the superintendent,
you don't go to jail.

00:13:27.625 --> 00:13:31.500
I want to hear some jail
time, all these things.

00:13:31.500 --> 00:13:33.750
They only gave me 10 minutes,
by the way, because they

00:13:33.750 --> 00:13:34.625
know I'm an activist.

00:13:34.625 --> 00:13:37.370
And to give an activist
10 minutes is crazy.

00:13:37.370 --> 00:13:39.120
But I'm going to try
to stick to that.

00:13:39.120 --> 00:13:43.190
Getting back to
the film, though,

00:13:43.190 --> 00:13:46.660
in "3 and 1/2 Minutes," when
Michael Dunn was at the gas

00:13:46.660 --> 00:13:50.490
station, not only did he take
the life of my son, Jordan

00:13:50.490 --> 00:13:54.400
Davis, but he also
took his own life

00:13:54.400 --> 00:13:57.520
because he doesn't have
freedom any longer.

00:13:57.520 --> 00:14:03.670
And for him to get that
mad over loud music

00:14:03.670 --> 00:14:06.000
is really not the case.

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:09.190
It's domestic terrorism,
that black lives don't

00:14:09.190 --> 00:14:12.490
matter anymore in this country.

00:14:12.490 --> 00:14:15.660
And so that's what we have to
get back to through this film.

00:14:15.660 --> 00:14:17.560
We're going to have a
Q and A after the film.

00:14:17.560 --> 00:14:18.980
It's going to be hot.

00:14:18.980 --> 00:14:19.910
We've got Linda here.

00:14:19.910 --> 00:14:22.940
You know she's hot.

00:14:22.940 --> 00:14:24.340
And we're going to have Mo here.

00:14:24.340 --> 00:14:25.680
Lamumba is here.

00:14:25.680 --> 00:14:27.090
It's going to be hot.

00:14:27.090 --> 00:14:32.060
And so I just want to take
a part of my 10 minutes also

00:14:32.060 --> 00:14:36.100
to recognize that we have
Trayvon Martin's brother,

00:14:36.100 --> 00:14:36.880
Jahavaris here.

00:14:36.880 --> 00:14:37.840
Stand up, Jahavaris.

00:14:37.840 --> 00:14:38.770
I know you shy.

00:14:38.770 --> 00:14:40.395
RAHIEL TESFAMARIAM:
Come on, Jahavaris.

00:14:40.395 --> 00:14:42.550
RON DAVIS: Trayvon's
brother right here.

00:14:42.550 --> 00:14:43.690
And I'm so glad to see him.

00:14:43.690 --> 00:14:45.840
We were together in
Geneva, Switzerland.

00:14:45.840 --> 00:14:47.810
We had a great
five days together.

00:14:47.810 --> 00:14:49.680
We hung out and got to
talk about everything

00:14:49.680 --> 00:14:51.120
but our situation.

00:14:51.120 --> 00:14:52.690
So we got to know each other.

00:14:52.690 --> 00:14:53.820
And he's a great young man.

00:14:53.820 --> 00:14:55.410
And our picture of
Jordan, maybe he

00:14:55.410 --> 00:14:57.000
could have been
working for Google.

00:14:57.000 --> 00:14:59.550
So it's a
heartbreaking situation

00:14:59.550 --> 00:15:01.370
to see all you
great-looking young people

00:15:01.370 --> 00:15:03.410
with these great jobs at Google.

00:15:03.410 --> 00:15:06.500
And I think of Jordan and
what he could have done had he

00:15:06.500 --> 00:15:08.940
lived to be past 17 years old.

00:15:08.940 --> 00:15:10.725
And I want to thank
HBO, and I want

00:15:10.725 --> 00:15:13.130
to thank Participant
Media, and also Google.

00:15:13.130 --> 00:15:14.440
Thank you very much.

00:15:14.440 --> 00:15:15.531
[APPLAUSE]

00:15:16.030 --> 00:15:18.580
RAHIEL TESFAMARIAM: So,
before we go into the film,

00:15:18.580 --> 00:15:21.110
I'm glad you
acknowledged Jahavaris.

00:15:21.110 --> 00:15:23.290
I think one of the
things that happens

00:15:23.290 --> 00:15:28.000
when you get to know individuals
connected to victims,

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:31.320
you often feel that
their spirit lives on

00:15:31.320 --> 00:15:33.090
through the family member.

00:15:33.090 --> 00:15:36.710
So I feel that sometimes I
get a glimpse of what Trayvon

00:15:36.710 --> 00:15:39.930
would have been like through
my interactions with Jahavaris.

00:15:39.930 --> 00:15:42.490
And I've always kind
of come to understand

00:15:42.490 --> 00:15:45.560
Jordan as a younger brother
in interacting with you all.

00:15:45.560 --> 00:15:49.040
But not everyone kind of gets
those intimate experiences

00:15:49.040 --> 00:15:53.370
where they can talk to you
and learn about that loved one

00:15:53.370 --> 00:15:54.250
through you.

00:15:54.250 --> 00:15:58.070
So can you share a
little bit about what

00:15:58.070 --> 00:16:00.580
you would want this audience
to know about your son

00:16:00.580 --> 00:16:02.500
that maybe they may
not get from the movie,

00:16:02.500 --> 00:16:05.759
but you want them to know.

00:16:05.759 --> 00:16:07.300
LUCY MCBATH: Of
course, in the movie,

00:16:07.300 --> 00:16:09.620
you don't really get a chance
to know much about Jordan

00:16:09.620 --> 00:16:10.870
until the very end.

00:16:10.870 --> 00:16:13.260
And so there's
always the back story

00:16:13.260 --> 00:16:15.430
that you don't know
about, the back story

00:16:15.430 --> 00:16:18.250
about where he was raised, and
all the friends that he had,

00:16:18.250 --> 00:16:20.060
and how he was raised.

00:16:20.060 --> 00:16:24.430
He was home-schooled
for many, many years.

00:16:24.430 --> 00:16:28.130
He was raised in church,
good strong foundation,

00:16:28.130 --> 00:16:31.970
spiritual upbringing,
loved by many, many people.

00:16:31.970 --> 00:16:36.430
Jordan, unlike his father,
never knew a stranger.

00:16:36.430 --> 00:16:38.740
Made friends very, very easily.

00:16:38.740 --> 00:16:43.320
And, in each one
of his friends, I

00:16:43.320 --> 00:16:45.310
could definitely
identify something

00:16:45.310 --> 00:16:47.510
that Jordan was
able to relate to.

00:16:47.510 --> 00:16:50.970
Jordan had a very big
compassionate heart.

00:16:50.970 --> 00:16:53.190
Jordan was always
the kind of kid

00:16:53.190 --> 00:16:55.660
that he wanted everybody
to have the same.

00:16:55.660 --> 00:16:58.990
He wanted everybody to have
the same opportunities.

00:16:58.990 --> 00:17:01.750
He wanted everyone to be
educated on the same level.

00:17:01.750 --> 00:17:05.760
He was always a champion
for the underdog.

00:17:05.760 --> 00:17:07.260
And so those are
the things that you

00:17:07.260 --> 00:17:09.569
don't get to know
about Jordan that we

00:17:09.569 --> 00:17:13.440
love about Jordan that we
continue to embrace because we

00:17:13.440 --> 00:17:15.920
have to embrace those memories
because we don't physically

00:17:15.920 --> 00:17:18.060
have him here anymore.

00:17:18.060 --> 00:17:21.609
You know, Jordan was just
the life of the party.

00:17:21.609 --> 00:17:24.650
Even his friend said whenever
Jordan walked in the room,

00:17:24.650 --> 00:17:25.790
there was a light.

00:17:25.790 --> 00:17:28.700
And he was always trying
to make you laugh.

00:17:28.700 --> 00:17:31.990
He had a great
sense of sensitivity

00:17:31.990 --> 00:17:35.680
and a great sense of
spiritual understanding.

00:17:35.680 --> 00:17:39.030
We used to have deep discussions
in my kitchen and in the car

00:17:39.030 --> 00:17:40.730
when he was riding next to me.

00:17:40.730 --> 00:17:42.980
And I would often
say, Jordan, how

00:17:42.980 --> 00:17:47.027
do you know some of the things
that you profess to know?

00:17:47.027 --> 00:17:48.360
And he'd say, I don't know, Mom.

00:17:48.360 --> 00:17:52.920
I just know, just very
intuitive, very, very wise

00:17:52.920 --> 00:17:54.670
beyond his years.

00:17:54.670 --> 00:17:57.040
But there again, I always
prayed that the Lord

00:17:57.040 --> 00:18:01.700
would give our child tremendous
strength, and wisdom,

00:18:01.700 --> 00:18:02.970
and understanding.

00:18:02.970 --> 00:18:08.810
And so he did end up
being all of those things

00:18:08.810 --> 00:18:11.420
and just a lover of people.

00:18:11.420 --> 00:18:14.580
And I used to always
say I think you're

00:18:14.580 --> 00:18:16.020
going to be a social activist.

00:18:16.020 --> 00:18:19.110
I see you bringing
people together.

00:18:19.110 --> 00:18:22.520
I see you championing
for a cause.

00:18:22.520 --> 00:18:25.617
And, actually, yes, he is.

00:18:25.617 --> 00:18:27.200
RAHIEL TESFAMARIAM:
Thank you so much.

00:18:27.200 --> 00:18:28.810
We're going to-- oh.

00:18:28.810 --> 00:18:30.230
Would you like to speak to that?

00:18:30.230 --> 00:18:31.688
RON DAVIS: Yeah,
I just want to say

00:18:31.688 --> 00:18:35.900
that understand that when you
have dealings with your parents

00:18:35.900 --> 00:18:38.400
if you're a young person here,
and the older people that

00:18:38.400 --> 00:18:42.260
have children, one thing
I always thank God for

00:18:42.260 --> 00:18:45.840
is the last words that
you say to your loved one

00:18:45.840 --> 00:18:48.160
before they die.

00:18:48.160 --> 00:18:51.230
Think about that because
whether it's good or bad,

00:18:51.230 --> 00:18:54.000
you have to live with that
for the rest of your life.

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:57.810
And Jordan was going to
the mall on Black Friday.

00:18:57.810 --> 00:19:00.475
And he asked me for some money
to go with his friend shopping.

00:19:00.475 --> 00:19:01.460
And I gave him some money.

00:19:01.460 --> 00:19:02.168
And I hugged him.

00:19:02.168 --> 00:19:04.320
And I told him that
I'd see him after work

00:19:04.320 --> 00:19:06.440
and that I'd see
him when I got home.

00:19:06.440 --> 00:19:09.330
And those are the last
words that was between us,

00:19:09.330 --> 00:19:11.360
the last smile that
was between us.

00:19:11.360 --> 00:19:13.390
And I thank God for that
because sometimes we

00:19:13.390 --> 00:19:16.620
argue with our children or are
you argue with your parents.

00:19:16.620 --> 00:19:18.340
Just think if that
was the last word

00:19:18.340 --> 00:19:20.630
you had with your loved ones.

00:19:20.630 --> 00:19:23.046
So when you go home
today, tonight,

00:19:23.046 --> 00:19:25.420
and during the holidays, and
you're with your loved ones,

00:19:25.420 --> 00:19:28.880
make sure those-- you
never know-- last words are

00:19:28.880 --> 00:19:32.910
great words, that love
is said between you,

00:19:32.910 --> 00:19:35.339
that all the things that are
little, minute new things,

00:19:35.339 --> 00:19:36.630
especially during the holidays.

00:19:36.630 --> 00:19:38.939
People have a sense of
this heightened things

00:19:38.939 --> 00:19:39.980
going during the holiday.

00:19:39.980 --> 00:19:42.600
That's why people argue a
lot during the holidays.

00:19:42.600 --> 00:19:44.350
People want to come
to certain homes,

00:19:44.350 --> 00:19:47.244
and they don't get there because
of certain things like traffic

00:19:47.244 --> 00:19:48.410
or whatever the case may be.

00:19:48.410 --> 00:19:51.080
And it's always the good and
the bad during the holidays.

00:19:51.080 --> 00:19:54.250
That's why there's so many
suicides during the holidays.

00:19:54.250 --> 00:19:57.030
So, after this film, I
want you to really look

00:19:57.030 --> 00:20:00.380
at how parents fight like
me and Lucy fought as hard

00:20:00.380 --> 00:20:01.737
as we could for Jordan.

00:20:01.737 --> 00:20:03.570
And I want you to fight
for your loved ones,

00:20:03.570 --> 00:20:06.340
for your parents, and for your
sisters, and your brothers.

00:20:06.340 --> 00:20:08.072
Fight hard for them
because you never

00:20:08.072 --> 00:20:10.280
know the next day whether
they're going to be around.

00:20:10.280 --> 00:20:12.161
See, we assume that
we're going to see them.

00:20:12.161 --> 00:20:13.660
We get on the phone,
and we say, OK.

00:20:13.660 --> 00:20:14.730
We'll see you tomorrow.

00:20:14.730 --> 00:20:16.730
And we really believe
that, don't we?

00:20:16.730 --> 00:20:17.780
We believe that.

00:20:17.780 --> 00:20:19.500
But God has another plan.

00:20:19.500 --> 00:20:22.180
And I get on my knees, and
I thank God every night

00:20:22.180 --> 00:20:27.570
that God gave me 17 years of
Jordan Davis, gave me 17 years.

00:20:27.570 --> 00:20:29.300
And that's all I'm
supposed to have.

00:20:29.300 --> 00:20:32.030
I have to sleep at night
and understand I was only

00:20:32.030 --> 00:20:33.720
supposed to have 17 years.

00:20:33.720 --> 00:20:35.310
And that is what I got.

00:20:35.310 --> 00:20:36.300
That's what I received.

00:20:36.300 --> 00:20:39.940
So every day in my life, I say
I'm one day closer to Jordan

00:20:39.940 --> 00:20:42.340
because I want to get
there where Jordan is.

00:20:42.340 --> 00:20:44.330
Thank you.

00:20:44.330 --> 00:20:46.760
So, in conclusion, we
did mention that Jordan

00:20:46.760 --> 00:20:48.900
was killed on Black Friday.

00:20:48.900 --> 00:20:51.700
And so Black Friday
recently passed--

00:20:51.700 --> 00:20:54.260
but one of the inspirations
behind the "Not One Dime"

00:20:54.260 --> 00:20:59.450
boycott-- is because so many of
the victims of police brutality

00:20:59.450 --> 00:21:02.890
were killed exactly around
this holiday season,

00:21:02.890 --> 00:21:07.360
be it Black Friday, Christmas,
the one-year non-indictment,

00:21:07.360 --> 00:21:10.240
and Eric Garner's
murder, as well

00:21:10.240 --> 00:21:13.080
as the one-year non-indictment
in the Ferguson decision.

00:21:13.080 --> 00:21:16.360
And so, beyond this
season every year,

00:21:16.360 --> 00:21:19.770
I ask people to kind of
use this holiday season

00:21:19.770 --> 00:21:23.400
as economic resistance to these
incidence of racism and police

00:21:23.400 --> 00:21:24.310
brutality.

00:21:24.310 --> 00:21:26.720
So honor the memory
of Jordan Davis

00:21:26.720 --> 00:21:29.430
and victims of police
brutality by resisting

00:21:29.430 --> 00:21:32.600
a capitalist system that
does not bring justice

00:21:32.600 --> 00:21:33.850
when justice is due.

00:21:33.850 --> 00:21:35.266
Thank you.

00:21:35.266 --> 00:21:38.074
[APPLAUSE]

00:21:41.155 --> 00:21:42.780
TORRENCE BOONE: Good
evening, everyone.

00:21:42.780 --> 00:21:45.740
Again, Torrence Boone--
I'm a senior leader

00:21:45.740 --> 00:21:48.550
here in the global business
organization at Google

00:21:48.550 --> 00:21:51.515
based in New York and
on behalf of Google.

00:21:51.515 --> 00:21:55.390
I want to thank you all for
coming this evening for carving

00:21:55.390 --> 00:21:59.530
out time to speak with
us, spend time with us,

00:21:59.530 --> 00:22:04.480
and discuss a set of incredibly
important issues for us

00:22:04.480 --> 00:22:05.710
as a collective society.

00:22:05.710 --> 00:22:07.530
So we're going to dive in.

00:22:07.530 --> 00:22:09.910
If I could get the
panel to come on

00:22:09.910 --> 00:22:14.230
stage, and I will do
quick introductions.

00:22:14.230 --> 00:22:16.950
All of you have
more detailed bios

00:22:16.950 --> 00:22:20.920
that were handed out as part
of the registration process.

00:22:20.920 --> 00:22:23.590
So I'm going to do
quick one-liners,

00:22:23.590 --> 00:22:27.300
and then we'll get into
the meat of the discussion.

00:22:27.300 --> 00:22:28.219
Thank you.

00:22:28.219 --> 00:22:28.719
Hi.

00:22:28.719 --> 00:22:31.557
[APPLAUSE]

00:22:34.400 --> 00:22:35.600
OK.

00:22:35.600 --> 00:22:44.630
So, to my right here, we
have Mo Meltzer-Cohen.

00:22:44.630 --> 00:22:47.460
And Mo is a criminal
defense attorney

00:22:47.460 --> 00:22:51.430
and teaches criminal
law at Hunter College.

00:22:51.430 --> 00:22:54.590
And next to Mo, we
have Linda Sarsour

00:22:54.590 --> 00:22:58.460
who is co-founder of
MPOWER, and she's also

00:22:58.460 --> 00:23:02.120
the national advocacy
director for the National

00:23:02.120 --> 00:23:05.080
Network for African
American communities.

00:23:05.080 --> 00:23:07.940
And she also serves
locally as the director

00:23:07.940 --> 00:23:11.070
of the Arab American
Association of New York, which

00:23:11.070 --> 00:23:13.240
is a social service
agency serving

00:23:13.240 --> 00:23:16.030
the Arab community in New York.

00:23:16.030 --> 00:23:19.740
You met Ron and
Lucy earlier today.

00:23:19.740 --> 00:23:23.520
And, next to Lucy,
Lumumba Bandele

00:23:23.520 --> 00:23:27.600
who is the senior community
organizer in the NAACP Legal

00:23:27.600 --> 00:23:30.880
Defense Fund, their
criminal justice practice.

00:23:30.880 --> 00:23:33.155
Again, a warm welcome
for our panelists.

00:23:33.155 --> 00:23:35.965
[APPLAUSE]

00:23:38.460 --> 00:23:42.380
So I'm going to go a
little bit off script, not

00:23:42.380 --> 00:23:45.830
that we were at all scripted.

00:23:45.830 --> 00:23:50.640
But, as I was packing up my
office to come to the event

00:23:50.640 --> 00:23:54.100
tonight-- and some of you may
have seen that it was just

00:23:54.100 --> 00:23:59.610
announced today-- that in my
native Baltimore a mistrial was

00:23:59.610 --> 00:24:00.750
declared in--

00:24:00.750 --> 00:24:02.160
[BOOING]

00:24:02.160 --> 00:24:06.170
--in the case against William
Porter, the police officer who

00:24:06.170 --> 00:24:10.640
was accused of
involuntary manslaughter,

00:24:10.640 --> 00:24:13.930
second degree assault
against Freddie Gray.

00:24:13.930 --> 00:24:19.340
I think probably everyone has
the context of that situation.

00:24:19.340 --> 00:24:21.940
But, in case not because,
unfortunately, there

00:24:21.940 --> 00:24:25.450
have been so many issues
and so many incidents

00:24:25.450 --> 00:24:27.770
that it starts to
blend together.

00:24:27.770 --> 00:24:31.270
But Freddie Gray was
abducted by a group

00:24:31.270 --> 00:24:35.210
of police officers in
Baltimore after an altercation.

00:24:35.210 --> 00:24:37.660
He was handcuffed, put
in the back of a van.

00:24:37.660 --> 00:24:41.080
The van drove around Baltimore
for about 40 minutes,

00:24:41.080 --> 00:24:43.060
six stops along the way.

00:24:43.060 --> 00:24:45.350
And, during that
time, Freddie Gray

00:24:45.350 --> 00:24:49.300
suffered a broken neck
and other bodily injuries

00:24:49.300 --> 00:24:52.370
that resulted in his death.

00:24:52.370 --> 00:24:56.460
So I thought, given
this late-breaking news

00:24:56.460 --> 00:24:59.720
in the backdrop of the
powerful story that we just

00:24:59.720 --> 00:25:04.510
heard about Jordan, I
would start with the panel

00:25:04.510 --> 00:25:11.220
to get their perspective on this
outcome to frame this outcome

00:25:11.220 --> 00:25:15.900
today in the greater scheme
of what we all just witnessed

00:25:15.900 --> 00:25:20.200
in the film and to kick us
off with the implications

00:25:20.200 --> 00:25:25.140
of that mistrial judgment
for our discussion tonight.

00:25:25.140 --> 00:25:30.690
And, perhaps, Ron and Lucy
could provide their thoughts

00:25:30.690 --> 00:25:31.300
as a kickoff.

00:25:33.870 --> 00:25:36.780
RON DAVIS: Well, it's all right
to be uncomfortable tonight,

00:25:36.780 --> 00:25:37.810
right?

00:25:37.810 --> 00:25:38.990
Is it all right?

00:25:38.990 --> 00:25:41.250
We can tell truth tonight?

00:25:41.250 --> 00:25:42.180
OK.

00:25:42.180 --> 00:25:46.000
First of all, the
system itself is unjust,

00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:47.470
but it's rigged to be unjust.

00:25:47.470 --> 00:25:49.810
It covers its own behind.

00:25:49.810 --> 00:25:51.400
I can say ass in
this room, right?

00:25:51.400 --> 00:25:54.880
It covers their
own ass, you know.

00:25:54.880 --> 00:26:01.240
And so when you look at a system
where the prosecutors have

00:26:01.240 --> 00:26:05.050
a symbiotic relationship
with the police department,

00:26:05.050 --> 00:26:08.330
they close many of their
cases with this same police

00:26:08.330 --> 00:26:09.870
department.

00:26:09.870 --> 00:26:12.240
So they're on a
friendly basis, and they

00:26:12.240 --> 00:26:14.515
uplift the police
when they testify

00:26:14.515 --> 00:26:16.980
against other defendants.

00:26:16.980 --> 00:26:21.050
So I cannot uplift the policemen
and then tear them down later

00:26:21.050 --> 00:26:24.300
on when he commits an act such
as what happened with Freddie

00:26:24.300 --> 00:26:28.550
Gray because I've held
him up to a standard,

00:26:28.550 --> 00:26:32.500
and then I've closed 12,
13 cases with him or her.

00:26:32.500 --> 00:26:35.870
And then, all of a sudden
now, if I tear him down,

00:26:35.870 --> 00:26:38.400
we have to go back and
re-look at all those cases

00:26:38.400 --> 00:26:41.640
that we closed by saying
this is an upstanding cop.

00:26:41.640 --> 00:26:44.450
So you have to understand
that the system itself--

00:26:44.450 --> 00:26:48.440
now the city managers
that worry about lawsuits

00:26:48.440 --> 00:26:51.220
against the city-- who are
they going to stand with?

00:26:51.220 --> 00:26:53.010
The police department.

00:26:53.010 --> 00:26:56.240
So the state
attorney is supposed

00:26:56.240 --> 00:27:00.060
to be the victim's advocate
because you understand

00:27:00.060 --> 00:27:02.530
in this legal
system that we have,

00:27:02.530 --> 00:27:06.750
a defendant can get the best
defense that money can buy.

00:27:06.750 --> 00:27:08.150
Am I correct?

00:27:08.150 --> 00:27:09.664
Best defense that money can buy.

00:27:09.664 --> 00:27:11.080
If you're a
multi-millionaire, you

00:27:11.080 --> 00:27:15.230
can get a multimillion
dollar team of attorneys.

00:27:15.230 --> 00:27:18.130
But think about the
victim's family in our case.

00:27:18.130 --> 00:27:22.421
You are represented by the
prosecutor in that county.

00:27:22.421 --> 00:27:23.420
You don't have a choice.

00:27:23.420 --> 00:27:25.250
You can be a billionaire.

00:27:25.250 --> 00:27:26.870
You don't have a choice.

00:27:26.870 --> 00:27:28.200
You have to be represented.

00:27:28.200 --> 00:27:33.541
If the prosecutor
is a knucklehead,

00:27:33.541 --> 00:27:36.160
if the prosecutor is a
friend of the police,

00:27:36.160 --> 00:27:38.310
if the prosecutor is
a friend of the court,

00:27:38.310 --> 00:27:40.570
the prosecutor is a
friend of the city clerk,

00:27:40.570 --> 00:27:43.090
and he knows if he
prosecute this policeman,

00:27:43.090 --> 00:27:48.350
he may have the police end
up having to pay $5 million,

00:27:48.350 --> 00:27:52.860
like in Chicago to the
families, $10 million,

00:27:52.860 --> 00:27:55.640
the Garner family, all this.

00:27:55.640 --> 00:28:02.150
So they have invested reason
to acquit the police department

00:28:02.150 --> 00:28:03.470
when there's wrongdoing.

00:28:03.470 --> 00:28:05.610
The only reason
I still say today

00:28:05.610 --> 00:28:07.620
that we got justice
in Jordan Davis case

00:28:07.620 --> 00:28:11.160
is because he was not
shot by a policeman.

00:28:11.160 --> 00:28:13.190
That is the only
reason we got justice.

00:28:13.190 --> 00:28:15.510
Had it been a policeman,
that prosecuter--

00:28:15.510 --> 00:28:17.560
the same one that let
George Zimmerman get away

00:28:17.560 --> 00:28:20.909
with murder-- is the same
prosecutor that we had here.

00:28:20.909 --> 00:28:22.950
And they would have let
him get away with murder,

00:28:22.950 --> 00:28:25.030
also, if he was a policeman.

00:28:25.030 --> 00:28:26.570
So we have to
change that system.

00:28:26.570 --> 00:28:28.120
The system is unjust.

00:28:28.120 --> 00:28:30.020
It can't defend itself.

00:28:30.020 --> 00:28:34.860
It can't-- I would say go
outside of that jurisdiction,

00:28:34.860 --> 00:28:37.630
and get somebody else, and
bring in a separate prosecutor

00:28:37.630 --> 00:28:40.640
whenever there's a police
shooting because they cannot

00:28:40.640 --> 00:28:42.660
prosecute themselves at all.

00:28:42.660 --> 00:28:44.750
We see it time and time again.

00:28:44.750 --> 00:28:47.140
Tamir Rice case, we
see it time and time--

00:28:47.140 --> 00:28:51.220
in Tamir Rice case even said
that this particular police

00:28:51.220 --> 00:28:55.360
officer had been kicked out
of another police department,

00:28:55.360 --> 00:28:58.460
told him that he was
unfit to be a policeman.

00:28:58.460 --> 00:29:01.750
And he still was hired by
another department in Cleveland

00:29:01.750 --> 00:29:05.690
and, within two seconds,
shoots a 12 year old

00:29:05.690 --> 00:29:08.630
when they have to report
that this was a play gun.

00:29:08.630 --> 00:29:10.180
So we see that time
and time again.

00:29:10.180 --> 00:29:12.370
And the only way to
change it is to make sure

00:29:12.370 --> 00:29:15.320
that you get outside
representation for the victim's

00:29:15.320 --> 00:29:18.340
family and the victim and
not use the prosecutor

00:29:18.340 --> 00:29:21.115
in the same jurisdiction.

00:29:21.115 --> 00:29:21.990
TORRENCE BOONE: Lucy.

00:29:21.990 --> 00:29:24.070
LUCY MCBATH: And
once again, we see

00:29:24.070 --> 00:29:29.570
this as another example of just
horrible, horrible behavior

00:29:29.570 --> 00:29:33.380
that continues to happen
within our police force

00:29:33.380 --> 00:29:37.840
against people of color,
people in our communities.

00:29:37.840 --> 00:29:45.715
But I will say this, is that we
talk a great deal as a people.

00:29:45.715 --> 00:29:49.290
We talk a great deal
about how bad it is

00:29:49.290 --> 00:29:53.210
and what's happening
out there, but we're not

00:29:53.210 --> 00:29:56.710
doing anything about it.

00:29:56.710 --> 00:29:58.640
I will say is that, yeah.

00:29:58.640 --> 00:30:00.970
We rally in the streets.

00:30:00.970 --> 00:30:04.170
Yes, we do all those
kinds of things.

00:30:04.170 --> 00:30:08.580
But to make the system's
accountable to us,

00:30:08.580 --> 00:30:10.930
to protecting us,
and our rights,

00:30:10.930 --> 00:30:13.750
and our freedoms
in this country,

00:30:13.750 --> 00:30:15.770
we have to be part
of the solution.

00:30:15.770 --> 00:30:19.990
And that goes beyond rallying,
and it goes beyond praying.

00:30:19.990 --> 00:30:26.940
We need to be there talking
to the Chief Justices.

00:30:26.940 --> 00:30:29.850
We need to be there
talking to our legislators.

00:30:29.850 --> 00:30:32.690
We need to be there
in those systems that

00:30:32.690 --> 00:30:36.060
continue to extend
this kind of behavior

00:30:36.060 --> 00:30:37.630
towards people of color.

00:30:37.630 --> 00:30:41.230
We need to make
them accountable.

00:30:41.230 --> 00:30:45.980
It's not going to be enough to
rally in the street about it.

00:30:45.980 --> 00:30:50.330
It's not going to be enough to
talk about how horrible it is

00:30:50.330 --> 00:30:53.360
and wait until the
next atrocity happens.

00:30:53.360 --> 00:30:58.380
If we are not in their
voting out the justices,

00:30:58.380 --> 00:31:00.220
and all of the
lawyers, and the people

00:31:00.220 --> 00:31:03.160
that we put in place that
allow these kinds of things

00:31:03.160 --> 00:31:06.210
to happen, then all we're
going to do is talk about it.

00:31:06.210 --> 00:31:08.220
And all we'll
continue to do is talk

00:31:08.220 --> 00:31:10.980
about the next time it
happens, and the next time

00:31:10.980 --> 00:31:15.520
it happens, and gather, and talk
about it behind closed doors.

00:31:15.520 --> 00:31:21.970
So we have to be accountable
as a community of minorities,

00:31:21.970 --> 00:31:24.440
as a community in
urban communities,

00:31:24.440 --> 00:31:28.770
we have to be accountable
for making the change happen.

00:31:28.770 --> 00:31:33.880
We have to pressure the powers
that be to make these changes.

00:31:33.880 --> 00:31:36.910
We have to let them know that
they are accountable to us,

00:31:36.910 --> 00:31:39.470
and we will take
them out of office.

00:31:39.470 --> 00:31:42.190
When you go to the polls--
when you go, and you're

00:31:42.190 --> 00:31:47.050
voting for your local and civil
leaders at the local level,

00:31:47.050 --> 00:31:50.180
this is where all
of this happens.

00:31:50.180 --> 00:31:52.230
This is where all
of this happens.

00:31:52.230 --> 00:31:55.010
You have a responsibility
to go to the polls

00:31:55.010 --> 00:31:58.960
and to scream loudly and
clearly about what's happening.

00:31:58.960 --> 00:32:03.160
And if you don't, shame on you.

00:32:03.160 --> 00:32:05.920
TORRENCE BOONE: Lumumba,
you were in Ferguson.

00:32:05.920 --> 00:32:07.990
You've spent your career
working in New York

00:32:07.990 --> 00:32:10.500
City on community activism.

00:32:10.500 --> 00:32:13.150
What are some of the big
lessons in the context

00:32:13.150 --> 00:32:16.640
of the discussion so far that
you would offer up things

00:32:16.640 --> 00:32:20.120
that you do in your community
work that could address

00:32:20.120 --> 00:32:21.154
some of these issues?

00:32:21.154 --> 00:32:22.820
LUMUMBA AKINWOLE-BANDELE:
Well, before I

00:32:22.820 --> 00:32:26.520
get to some of the tools, I want
to sort of add another insult

00:32:26.520 --> 00:32:28.311
onto what we're
doing right now, what

00:32:28.311 --> 00:32:29.560
we're talking about right now.

00:32:29.560 --> 00:32:35.260
As we hear about the
mistrial in Baltimore,

00:32:35.260 --> 00:32:38.210
we also got word
that Kenneth Boss,

00:32:38.210 --> 00:32:42.500
one of the cops responsible for
the murder of Amadou Diallo,

00:32:42.500 --> 00:32:49.070
is just set to get a promotion
in the NYPD tomorrow.

00:32:49.070 --> 00:32:54.670
So I want to add that to really
underscore what both Mrs.

00:32:54.670 --> 00:32:57.080
McBath and Mr. Davis have said.

00:32:57.080 --> 00:33:00.900
We've been down this
road so many times.

00:33:00.900 --> 00:33:05.050
And we have to recognize the
tools we have in our toolbox.

00:33:05.050 --> 00:33:07.200
Voting is one tool.

00:33:07.200 --> 00:33:08.630
It's an effective tool.

00:33:08.630 --> 00:33:11.280
If that is the tool that
you use, that you all

00:33:11.280 --> 00:33:13.890
have sharpened, that
you've mastered,

00:33:13.890 --> 00:33:16.891
that also means that you
have another tool directly

00:33:16.891 --> 00:33:17.640
connected to that.

00:33:17.640 --> 00:33:22.520
And that is to exist and have
a strong presence in the jury.

00:33:22.520 --> 00:33:24.020
We have a culture
of wanting to make

00:33:24.020 --> 00:33:28.630
sure we do everything possible
to stay out of the jury box.

00:33:28.630 --> 00:33:29.720
I got a cold.

00:33:29.720 --> 00:33:31.800
I got to work, whatever.

00:33:31.800 --> 00:33:35.650
If you feel that strongly
about your tool of voting,

00:33:35.650 --> 00:33:39.210
you should have no
problem whatsoever

00:33:39.210 --> 00:33:42.220
existing, and making
up your presence,

00:33:42.220 --> 00:33:45.100
and developing a
culture of doing

00:33:45.100 --> 00:33:51.660
jury takeovers to make sure
that we have different outcomes.

00:33:51.660 --> 00:33:52.550
So that's that.

00:33:52.550 --> 00:33:53.850
We have other tools.

00:33:53.850 --> 00:33:58.430
If your voice is heard loud and
strong in the streets, do it.

00:33:58.430 --> 00:34:02.170
If that's not your place,
where is your place?

00:34:02.170 --> 00:34:04.310
How will you make
your voice heard?

00:34:04.310 --> 00:34:07.540
But being home talking about
the young people in the streets

00:34:07.540 --> 00:34:10.179
is not helping.

00:34:10.179 --> 00:34:12.310
Being home talking about
all the other tools

00:34:12.310 --> 00:34:15.100
that you consider to be
ineffective is not helping.

00:34:15.100 --> 00:34:15.929
What's your tool?

00:34:18.013 --> 00:34:18.929
TORRENCE BOONE: Linda.

00:34:26.449 --> 00:34:27.199
LINDA SARSOUR: Oh.

00:34:27.199 --> 00:34:29.732
I don't know after that.

00:34:29.732 --> 00:34:31.440
I mean, I'm sure most
of you are probably

00:34:31.440 --> 00:34:36.190
the same emotional space that
I'm on, but I'm really moved.

00:34:36.190 --> 00:34:39.840
And I've been moved before
by Lucy and Uncle Ron.

00:34:39.840 --> 00:34:43.710
I have a son who's
also 17 years old.

00:34:43.710 --> 00:34:48.639
And just hearing the voices of
Uncle Ron and Lucy in the movie

00:34:48.639 --> 00:34:50.820
just really touches
me deep to my core.

00:34:50.820 --> 00:34:53.500
And it reminds me about
the value of life,

00:34:53.500 --> 00:34:56.889
and whose life matters, and
who says whose life matters,

00:34:56.889 --> 00:34:58.830
and whose word matters.

00:34:58.830 --> 00:35:03.860
And I worked this past
year with a family

00:35:03.860 --> 00:35:08.267
in Chapel Hill, North Carolina
where three young college

00:35:08.267 --> 00:35:10.600
students, two young women who
looked just like me-- they

00:35:10.600 --> 00:35:12.090
could've been my little
sisters, literally.

00:35:12.090 --> 00:35:13.173
They look exactly like me.

00:35:13.173 --> 00:35:15.080
People thought they
were related to me.

00:35:15.080 --> 00:35:16.917
And I worked with
this family helping

00:35:16.917 --> 00:35:18.500
them get their voice
out in the media.

00:35:18.500 --> 00:35:22.540
They were shot execution
style by a man who

00:35:22.540 --> 00:35:25.550
was basically a Islamophobe.

00:35:25.550 --> 00:35:26.740
They were his neighbors.

00:35:26.740 --> 00:35:30.230
And he literally went
into their home, shot them

00:35:30.230 --> 00:35:31.200
in the head, each one.

00:35:31.200 --> 00:35:34.570
One at a time, he shot them.

00:35:34.570 --> 00:35:37.210
And the media wanted
you to believe

00:35:37.210 --> 00:35:40.850
that a man would be so
angry, that he could shoot

00:35:40.850 --> 00:35:45.460
three young Muslim students
execution style over a parking

00:35:45.460 --> 00:35:48.270
spot.

00:35:48.270 --> 00:35:52.380
We were supposed to believe
that Michael Dunn was so angry,

00:35:52.380 --> 00:35:54.530
that he was so
scared for his life

00:35:54.530 --> 00:35:58.140
that he was going to shoot
four teenage boys in a car.

00:35:58.140 --> 00:36:02.340
And what this reminds
me of, our common enemy,

00:36:02.340 --> 00:36:06.130
the word of white supremacy
against our communities

00:36:06.130 --> 00:36:08.290
that we can walk
around in a street,

00:36:08.290 --> 00:36:10.777
and people can snatch their
kids up from next to our kids

00:36:10.777 --> 00:36:13.360
playing in the park because they
don't want their kids to play

00:36:13.360 --> 00:36:17.046
with terrorists or a woman who
wants to snatch her purse when

00:36:17.046 --> 00:36:19.170
she sees a young black man
because all black people

00:36:19.170 --> 00:36:20.270
are criminals.

00:36:20.270 --> 00:36:25.540
This idea of who labels
us and who are we to who,

00:36:25.540 --> 00:36:26.630
it gives me affinity.

00:36:26.630 --> 00:36:29.080
And that's why many folks
in this room that I know

00:36:29.080 --> 00:36:31.760
and why I work on issues
like police brutality, which

00:36:31.760 --> 00:36:34.640
don't necessarily directly
impact me as an individual.

00:36:34.640 --> 00:36:39.270
But what I believe is
we live in a country

00:36:39.270 --> 00:36:41.417
that if black life
doesn't matter,

00:36:41.417 --> 00:36:43.250
then my life and the
life of people who look

00:36:43.250 --> 00:36:45.220
like me is not going to matter.

00:36:45.220 --> 00:36:49.390
And if we don't make
and force our country

00:36:49.390 --> 00:36:52.300
to make black life matter--
for us to really believe that,

00:36:52.300 --> 00:36:55.660
not just to say, but for it
to be real for black people--

00:36:55.660 --> 00:36:58.540
then there's nothing
that I can do

00:36:58.540 --> 00:37:01.050
that's going to make people
who look like me's life matter,

00:37:01.050 --> 00:37:03.620
make me valuable, make
my children valuable.

00:37:03.620 --> 00:37:08.686
And recently just with
our kids watching TV,

00:37:08.686 --> 00:37:10.810
and all they hear is Muslim
terrorists, terrorists,

00:37:10.810 --> 00:37:12.170
Muslims, everybody.

00:37:12.170 --> 00:37:15.330
It's like the trauma that
young black kids hear when

00:37:15.330 --> 00:37:17.470
they hear thugs and gangsters.

00:37:17.470 --> 00:37:20.120
And what kind of message does
that send to our children?

00:37:20.120 --> 00:37:22.154
Our children start
questioning who they are.

00:37:22.154 --> 00:37:23.570
They're not taught
in this country

00:37:23.570 --> 00:37:25.310
to be proud of who they are.

00:37:25.310 --> 00:37:26.700
Our children right
now are asking

00:37:26.700 --> 00:37:27.824
is Muslim the right choice?

00:37:27.824 --> 00:37:29.360
Why are we even that?

00:37:29.360 --> 00:37:31.210
There must be
something wrong here.

00:37:31.210 --> 00:37:33.130
And I think that what
people don't understand

00:37:33.130 --> 00:37:34.940
is the trauma that
causes young people.

00:37:34.940 --> 00:37:37.360
And that's why our kids struggle
to succeed in this world

00:37:37.360 --> 00:37:39.400
because they haven't
found their place.

00:37:39.400 --> 00:37:41.590
And the institutions that
they're trying to impress

00:37:41.590 --> 00:37:43.670
or they're trying
to prove to are

00:37:43.670 --> 00:37:45.670
institutions that
have been created

00:37:45.670 --> 00:37:47.750
not to accept people like them.

00:37:47.750 --> 00:37:49.600
The system wasn't made
for people like us.

00:37:49.600 --> 00:37:53.480
So I have a lot of
affinity to Trayvon,

00:37:53.480 --> 00:37:55.900
to hearing the vilification
of people even when they're

00:37:55.900 --> 00:37:56.900
dead in their corpse.

00:37:56.900 --> 00:37:58.262
Their bodies are still warm.

00:37:58.262 --> 00:37:59.970
And we vilifying them,
talking about what

00:37:59.970 --> 00:38:02.187
they did two weeks
ago and six years ago.

00:38:02.187 --> 00:38:04.520
it just really breaks my heart
that we live in a country

00:38:04.520 --> 00:38:07.290
where we continue to do this.

00:38:07.290 --> 00:38:10.940
TORRENCE BOONE: Mo, as the
criminal defense attorney,

00:38:10.940 --> 00:38:13.990
a professor of
criminal law, can you

00:38:13.990 --> 00:38:17.840
give us more context on
what's going on here?

00:38:17.840 --> 00:38:22.550
What are the legal
drivers that are at play?

00:38:22.550 --> 00:38:27.480
Ron mentioned the
prosecutors, that issue.

00:38:27.480 --> 00:38:31.155
What are the other things that
drive the kind of outcomes

00:38:31.155 --> 00:38:33.280
that we're seeing from the
criminal justice system?

00:38:33.280 --> 00:38:37.520
And what can we do
to address them?

00:38:37.520 --> 00:38:40.110
MOIRA MELTZER-COHEN:
Just an easy one, right?

00:38:40.110 --> 00:38:42.280
I do want to make
one small correction.

00:38:42.280 --> 00:38:45.140
I'm not teaching
criminal law right now.

00:38:45.140 --> 00:38:46.890
I have taught criminal law.

00:38:49.720 --> 00:38:55.910
So I think it's really
important-- for everybody--

00:38:55.910 --> 00:38:57.610
but I think,
particularly, for people

00:38:57.610 --> 00:39:00.680
who have the luxury
of maintaining

00:39:00.680 --> 00:39:05.590
this sort of delusion to stop
thinking about the police

00:39:05.590 --> 00:39:08.940
as being an organization,
an institution that

00:39:08.940 --> 00:39:12.100
is there to protect all people.

00:39:12.100 --> 00:39:16.220
So the whole concept
of policing was

00:39:16.220 --> 00:39:18.530
developed in the United States.

00:39:18.530 --> 00:39:21.090
Policing is not an
old institution.

00:39:21.090 --> 00:39:22.860
It's a fairly new institution.

00:39:22.860 --> 00:39:25.560
And American policing was
developed in the United States

00:39:25.560 --> 00:39:28.580
to protect the property
of moneyed white people

00:39:28.580 --> 00:39:31.860
at a time when black people
were considered property.

00:39:31.860 --> 00:39:34.030
So I think that one of
the things that's going on

00:39:34.030 --> 00:39:37.890
is, yes, that's what the
police are there for.

00:39:37.890 --> 00:39:40.220
Another thing that's
going on, as Ron

00:39:40.220 --> 00:39:44.870
said, we need special
prosecutors because the way

00:39:44.870 --> 00:39:48.710
that cases get closed is
that the police testify

00:39:48.710 --> 00:39:50.290
against criminal defendants.

00:39:50.290 --> 00:39:51.950
And, since the
police are the people

00:39:51.950 --> 00:39:54.450
who are out there
selectively enforcing

00:39:54.450 --> 00:39:56.920
laws and disproportionately
and aggressively

00:39:56.920 --> 00:40:00.170
policing working class
communities of color,

00:40:00.170 --> 00:40:08.110
that means that their entire
job description involves putting

00:40:08.110 --> 00:40:10.300
poor black people in jail.

00:40:10.300 --> 00:40:15.430
And so it becomes very
difficult for a prosecutor

00:40:15.430 --> 00:40:22.410
to sincerely, and earnestly,
and zealously prosecute

00:40:22.410 --> 00:40:23.860
a police officer.

00:40:23.860 --> 00:40:25.777
So I think that call
for special prosecutors

00:40:25.777 --> 00:40:26.610
is absolutely right.

00:40:26.610 --> 00:40:28.690
And I really want to
second what Lumumba said.

00:40:31.450 --> 00:40:34.490
I know that it's
almost become a running

00:40:34.490 --> 00:40:36.340
joke about jury service.

00:40:36.340 --> 00:40:40.070
But this is actually
an opportunity for you

00:40:40.070 --> 00:40:51.500
to go and truly serve your
community to be a peer,

00:40:51.500 --> 00:40:59.220
to render judgment, or to
refuse to punish someone,

00:40:59.220 --> 00:41:02.310
to hear all that
evidence, and to really

00:41:02.310 --> 00:41:08.220
act in the service of justice
because the law and justice are

00:41:08.220 --> 00:41:11.240
not related to each other.

00:41:11.240 --> 00:41:14.850
And I think that, especially
for people who have always

00:41:14.850 --> 00:41:17.990
had the privilege of believing
that the law and justice,

00:41:17.990 --> 00:41:23.120
that that's a Venn diagram that
has a real substantial overlap,

00:41:23.120 --> 00:41:25.620
it's time to shed that idea.

00:41:25.620 --> 00:41:27.880
It's time to really
acknowledge the reality

00:41:27.880 --> 00:41:31.340
of what is happening and what
has always been happening.

00:41:31.340 --> 00:41:33.620
I think it's a real
mistake to think

00:41:33.620 --> 00:41:36.820
that this is a system that
started out good and got

00:41:36.820 --> 00:41:39.100
corrupted or that this is
a system that, in some way,

00:41:39.100 --> 00:41:44.490
can be redeemed because
it has never been intended

00:41:44.490 --> 00:41:46.055
to serve all people equally.

00:41:49.230 --> 00:41:51.030
I think it's really
crucial, it's

00:41:51.030 --> 00:41:56.220
really critical for anyone
who has relative power

00:41:56.220 --> 00:41:59.670
to be really honest
with themselves

00:41:59.670 --> 00:42:02.270
and to be really
honest with whoever's

00:42:02.270 --> 00:42:04.780
proximate to you,
to your communities

00:42:04.780 --> 00:42:11.200
to work to dismantle the idea
that the law and justice,

00:42:11.200 --> 00:42:13.900
that any well-developed
concept of justice

00:42:13.900 --> 00:42:18.715
has really any relationship
to the American legal system.

00:42:21.500 --> 00:42:23.860
TORRENCE BOONE: On the topic
of special prosecutors,

00:42:23.860 --> 00:42:25.610
how does that happen?

00:42:25.610 --> 00:42:27.490
How are special
prosecutors appointed?

00:42:27.490 --> 00:42:31.682
What are the situations
that underpin that?

00:42:31.682 --> 00:42:33.640
MOIRA MELTZER-COHEN: I
mean, it usually happens

00:42:33.640 --> 00:42:36.510
when there's an
egregious abuse of power.

00:42:36.510 --> 00:42:40.670
But this actually isn't-- I'm
not sure I'm entirely qualified

00:42:40.670 --> 00:42:44.840
to answer that question as far
as the technical aspects of it.

00:42:44.840 --> 00:42:51.750
But I think the
central piece of why

00:42:51.750 --> 00:42:55.300
we need special prosecutors
is that the whole logic

00:42:55.300 --> 00:42:56.780
behind having a
special prosecutor

00:42:56.780 --> 00:42:59.740
is that whoever is
normally the prosecutor

00:42:59.740 --> 00:43:02.730
is too entrenched
in a system of power

00:43:02.730 --> 00:43:08.190
that has gone horribly wrong
and where that power has been

00:43:08.190 --> 00:43:12.640
so egregiously
abused that it's not

00:43:12.640 --> 00:43:19.310
possible to maintain
even the appearance

00:43:19.310 --> 00:43:21.115
of impartial justice.

00:43:24.154 --> 00:43:25.320
RON DAVIS: It's interesting.

00:43:25.320 --> 00:43:27.540
But when you say
who has the power?

00:43:27.540 --> 00:43:30.864
Actually, who has the power is
the governors of the states.

00:43:30.864 --> 00:43:32.780
You have to realize the
federal government was

00:43:32.780 --> 00:43:36.650
created by the 13 colonies.

00:43:36.650 --> 00:43:39.400
And they've taken back to power
from the federal government.

00:43:39.400 --> 00:43:42.690
So that's why you see, every
time there's a mass shooting,

00:43:42.690 --> 00:43:47.620
President Obama looks like
he's just swallowed an egg.

00:43:47.620 --> 00:43:50.300
Because every time
he puts out something

00:43:50.300 --> 00:43:55.484
to discourage shooters, even
in the no fly zone-- anything

00:43:55.484 --> 00:43:57.900
that he puts out that says,
well, if they're on the no fly

00:43:57.900 --> 00:44:00.060
list, then we should
make sure that they

00:44:00.060 --> 00:44:02.085
don't get a chance to get guns.

00:44:02.085 --> 00:44:03.460
And he shakes his
head because he

00:44:03.460 --> 00:44:05.376
knows if he tries to
pass it through Congress,

00:44:05.376 --> 00:44:08.570
and he tries to pass it through
the Senate, they won't pass it.

00:44:08.570 --> 00:44:11.700
But, see, when I say power,
the governor of Connecticut

00:44:11.700 --> 00:44:13.380
decided, you know what?

00:44:13.380 --> 00:44:17.060
If you come into Connecticut,
and you're on the no fly list,

00:44:17.060 --> 00:44:19.620
you cannot get a gun or
bring a gun in the state

00:44:19.620 --> 00:44:20.840
of Connecticut.

00:44:20.840 --> 00:44:23.450
So the governors do
have the power to do it.

00:44:23.450 --> 00:44:27.301
And he made an executive order
to be effective immediately.

00:44:27.301 --> 00:44:27.800
See?

00:44:27.800 --> 00:44:31.182
So the governors of each state
can actually take action.

00:44:31.182 --> 00:44:32.640
LUMUMBA AKINWOLE-BANDELE:
If I can,

00:44:32.640 --> 00:44:34.420
I want to give a
little history about,

00:44:34.420 --> 00:44:37.460
at least in New York,
the call for-- which

00:44:37.460 --> 00:44:40.090
was originally
independent prosecutors.

00:44:40.090 --> 00:44:43.930
In '95, many of us were
doing this work in response

00:44:43.930 --> 00:44:49.600
to the killing of Anthony Baez
who was murdered Christmas

00:44:49.600 --> 00:44:53.109
Day by Officer Francis Livoti.

00:44:53.109 --> 00:44:54.650
And we decided that
we needed to stop

00:44:54.650 --> 00:44:56.670
this pattern of
continuously trying

00:44:56.670 --> 00:45:00.120
to go to DAs to get
justice when we recognized

00:45:00.120 --> 00:45:03.320
for decades that this was a
pattern that was not happening.

00:45:03.320 --> 00:45:06.120
We recognized that there
was a significant conflict

00:45:06.120 --> 00:45:10.450
of interest that Mr. Davis
clearly explained that does not

00:45:10.450 --> 00:45:15.090
allow the prosecutors
to be objective

00:45:15.090 --> 00:45:16.910
in any way in terms
of investigation

00:45:16.910 --> 00:45:18.700
and certainly not prosecution.

00:45:18.700 --> 00:45:20.470
And so the call
from the community,

00:45:20.470 --> 00:45:22.480
particularly the
parents at that time,

00:45:22.480 --> 00:45:24.520
was for an
independent prosecutor

00:45:24.520 --> 00:45:26.802
that did not have any
attachment to the state.

00:45:26.802 --> 00:45:29.010
Now people have said, well,
what does that look like?

00:45:29.010 --> 00:45:31.950
Will, I mean, it hasn't
manifested itself

00:45:31.950 --> 00:45:35.160
in any real way other
than a state attorney

00:45:35.160 --> 00:45:36.140
general taking it over.

00:45:36.140 --> 00:45:38.670
And that's where the term
special prosecutor came in.

00:45:38.670 --> 00:45:41.000
And so, even with
the executive order

00:45:41.000 --> 00:45:45.180
that was passed here in New
York State earlier this year,

00:45:45.180 --> 00:45:49.140
that was done based
on decades of pushing.

00:45:49.140 --> 00:45:51.820
When people told us in
'95, that's impossible.

00:45:51.820 --> 00:45:53.340
That will never happen.

00:45:53.340 --> 00:45:56.410
People told us earlier this
year, told their parents

00:45:56.410 --> 00:45:59.202
the state attorney general and
the governor hate each other.

00:45:59.202 --> 00:46:00.660
There's no way in
the world they'll

00:46:00.660 --> 00:46:02.820
come to an agreement for
this to actually happen.

00:46:02.820 --> 00:46:06.456
But it wasn't until those
parents stood with people

00:46:06.456 --> 00:46:08.330
in the streets, stood
with elected officials,

00:46:08.330 --> 00:46:10.880
said this is not
even negotiable.

00:46:10.880 --> 00:46:12.890
It's going to happen,
that it actually happened.

00:46:12.890 --> 00:46:14.770
It's not perfect.

00:46:14.770 --> 00:46:16.670
In fact, the governor's
playing with words

00:46:16.670 --> 00:46:19.400
trying to make it sound
like it's temporary.

00:46:19.400 --> 00:46:22.540
But it's not exactly
what we want.

00:46:22.540 --> 00:46:25.824
But it is a step in
the right direction.

00:46:25.824 --> 00:46:27.740
MOIRA MELTZER-COHEN:
We're going to open it up

00:46:27.740 --> 00:46:30.900
in just a few minutes for
questions from the audience.

00:46:30.900 --> 00:46:33.334
We want to make
sure that we address

00:46:33.334 --> 00:46:34.500
any questions that you have.

00:46:34.500 --> 00:46:38.390
So if you want to step to
the mics, please do that.

00:46:38.390 --> 00:46:43.080
Just to continue the dialogue
around what we can actually do.

00:46:43.080 --> 00:46:46.920
I mean, here at Google, we are
incredibly action oriented.

00:46:46.920 --> 00:46:49.900
We have a mission around
making the world a better

00:46:49.900 --> 00:46:52.890
place, changing the world for
the better, through technology,

00:46:52.890 --> 00:46:58.160
through our community of team
members around the world.

00:46:58.160 --> 00:47:02.590
And, I guess, my sort of last
question before we open it up

00:47:02.590 --> 00:47:04.850
would be what do
you think we can

00:47:04.850 --> 00:47:08.990
do as Google from an
individual perspective,

00:47:08.990 --> 00:47:13.390
from a corporate perspective
to push this more

00:47:13.390 --> 00:47:16.710
aggressive agenda and
address the issues

00:47:16.710 --> 00:47:19.340
of criminal injustice that
we've been talking about?

00:47:24.100 --> 00:47:27.350
LINDA SARSOUR: I mean, for me,
one of things that I really

00:47:27.350 --> 00:47:28.850
focus on is intersectionality.

00:47:28.850 --> 00:47:30.494
How do we tell
each other stories?

00:47:30.494 --> 00:47:32.410
How do we got each other's
back when we're not

00:47:32.410 --> 00:47:33.410
in each other's rooms?

00:47:33.410 --> 00:47:35.300
And I think that's
really important.

00:47:35.300 --> 00:47:37.250
I want to be the
first person to defend

00:47:37.250 --> 00:47:40.350
a young black unarmed kid
that's shot by the police.

00:47:40.350 --> 00:47:43.170
And I want black people--
which this already

00:47:43.170 --> 00:47:45.460
happens because I've
been working in building

00:47:45.460 --> 00:47:49.046
relationships-- when
they hear someone say

00:47:49.046 --> 00:47:50.420
we've got to lock
the Muslims up,

00:47:50.420 --> 00:47:52.814
or we don't want them here,
that you're the first person

00:47:52.814 --> 00:47:53.480
to be like wait.

00:47:53.480 --> 00:47:54.790
Chill.

00:47:54.790 --> 00:47:56.290
That's not cool.

00:47:56.290 --> 00:48:01.110
So I think what I always
tell people is ask questions.

00:48:01.110 --> 00:48:03.500
You might have a friend
at Google who is Muslim.

00:48:03.500 --> 00:48:05.305
Have a conversation.

00:48:05.305 --> 00:48:05.930
Check them out.

00:48:05.930 --> 00:48:06.950
Be like, hey, I'd
love to see you

00:48:06.950 --> 00:48:08.220
at the cafeteria
for a few minutes.

00:48:08.220 --> 00:48:09.090
I want to ask you some stuff.

00:48:09.090 --> 00:48:11.215
I think a lot of times
we're so apprehensive to ask

00:48:11.215 --> 00:48:13.247
people and kind of
find out who they are.

00:48:13.247 --> 00:48:14.830
They're not just the
Google executive.

00:48:14.830 --> 00:48:16.967
They're not just the
little programmer.

00:48:16.967 --> 00:48:18.050
They're actually a person.

00:48:18.050 --> 00:48:18.930
And they have a family.

00:48:18.930 --> 00:48:19.900
They have aspirations.

00:48:19.900 --> 00:48:20.689
They have dreams.

00:48:20.689 --> 00:48:22.480
They have the kind of
music that they like.

00:48:22.480 --> 00:48:23.854
And I think,
oftentimes, we don't

00:48:23.854 --> 00:48:25.890
see each other in that way.

00:48:25.890 --> 00:48:28.540
And I think the best
relationships that I have,

00:48:28.540 --> 00:48:30.970
and the best activism
work, the best movement

00:48:30.970 --> 00:48:33.740
work that I've done is when
I'm at somebody's house,

00:48:33.740 --> 00:48:35.720
or when I went to
a movie with them,

00:48:35.720 --> 00:48:37.720
or when I went to chill
with them after a rally,

00:48:37.720 --> 00:48:40.000
and just hung out in a
park, and sat on a bench,

00:48:40.000 --> 00:48:42.880
and heard about their kid
and what happened last week.

00:48:42.880 --> 00:48:45.340
And I think, oftentimes,
we're so up here trying

00:48:45.340 --> 00:48:46.920
to be all we're social justice.

00:48:46.920 --> 00:48:49.090
We're going to bring
justice to the world.

00:48:49.090 --> 00:48:51.400
But really the times
where I've felt

00:48:51.400 --> 00:48:52.870
the most meaningful
moments for me

00:48:52.870 --> 00:48:55.440
was when I heard about
somebody's brother who

00:48:55.440 --> 00:48:55.940
got shot.

00:48:55.940 --> 00:48:58.060
And I got to hear
that story personally.

00:48:58.060 --> 00:49:01.110
Or someone who's father
got deported just

00:49:01.110 --> 00:49:03.040
for simply not having papers.

00:49:03.040 --> 00:49:05.460
I think those are the most
meaningful moments of just

00:49:05.460 --> 00:49:07.990
being able to see people
for who they are as human

00:49:07.990 --> 00:49:10.290
and kind of shed off
all that extra stuff,

00:49:10.290 --> 00:49:12.672
and just kind of hear
that-- just from the heart,

00:49:12.672 --> 00:49:15.130
I think that's really the most
moving thing that has helped

00:49:15.130 --> 00:49:18.070
me believe that there is
still hope in the world, even

00:49:18.070 --> 00:49:20.635
through all the
darkness that we see.

00:49:20.635 --> 00:49:22.010
LUMUMBA
AKINWOLE-BANDELE: I would

00:49:22.010 --> 00:49:25.240
add that I was trained
as an organizer

00:49:25.240 --> 00:49:28.360
to when you want to Impact an
issue, the first question you

00:49:28.360 --> 00:49:30.400
ask yourself is what
is my individual

00:49:30.400 --> 00:49:35.560
and collective relationship
to that issue or those issues?

00:49:35.560 --> 00:49:41.050
Google is the platform
of the earth right now.

00:49:41.050 --> 00:49:44.700
You actually have the ability
to tell the story in a way

00:49:44.700 --> 00:49:47.610
that impacts the world
and how they see us,

00:49:47.610 --> 00:49:49.660
how they see our experiences.

00:49:49.660 --> 00:49:51.650
So I think being
able to highlight

00:49:51.650 --> 00:49:54.520
other independent media
is extremely important so

00:49:54.520 --> 00:49:59.130
that people are not relying
solely on CNN, on NBC, on Fox.

00:49:59.130 --> 00:50:02.040
But being able to allow
independent media that

00:50:02.040 --> 00:50:06.870
comes from us, that
actually shares our values,

00:50:06.870 --> 00:50:09.360
and actually tells our stories
the way they need to be told

00:50:09.360 --> 00:50:10.485
is extremely significant.

00:50:10.485 --> 00:50:11.860
And then some of
the small things

00:50:11.860 --> 00:50:14.220
you do, like them
little configurations

00:50:14.220 --> 00:50:15.600
you have on the
Google thing when

00:50:15.600 --> 00:50:17.370
you do stuff like on
Black History Month,

00:50:17.370 --> 00:50:19.234
those things are
really impactful.

00:50:19.234 --> 00:50:20.400
I think those are important.

00:50:20.400 --> 00:50:24.440
So those things like that,
I think, go a long way.

00:50:24.440 --> 00:50:28.300
Being able to allow people
to have access to the source

00:50:28.300 --> 00:50:30.950
is extremely important.

00:50:30.950 --> 00:50:32.700
RON DAVIS: And everything
is money-driven.

00:50:32.700 --> 00:50:35.790
Be encouraged by what happened
at the University in Missouri,

00:50:35.790 --> 00:50:39.000
I believe it was, what
the football team did.

00:50:39.000 --> 00:50:39.870
Be encouraged.

00:50:39.870 --> 00:50:44.070
These young people put their
careers on the line and say,

00:50:44.070 --> 00:50:46.480
"we're not going to play a
football game until we get rid

00:50:46.480 --> 00:50:48.540
of this racism."

00:50:48.540 --> 00:50:50.390
So be encouraged by
that as young people.

00:50:50.390 --> 00:50:55.167
And when I've attended
YouTube and Black Googlers,

00:50:55.167 --> 00:50:56.750
they tell me that
the YouTube channel,

00:50:56.750 --> 00:51:00.230
you can reach 12 million people
across the country at one time.

00:51:00.230 --> 00:51:01.990
Look at that power
that you have.

00:51:01.990 --> 00:51:04.435
Understand the power that you
have in this room, the power

00:51:04.435 --> 00:51:05.990
you have in these buildings.

00:51:05.990 --> 00:51:09.830
And so, I would say,
follow the money.

00:51:09.830 --> 00:51:10.790
Do like ALEC.

00:51:10.790 --> 00:51:14.490
ALEC is an organization
that the NRA uses.

00:51:14.490 --> 00:51:16.930
And they are
basically lobbyists.

00:51:16.930 --> 00:51:18.590
And they go all
across the country.

00:51:18.590 --> 00:51:21.930
And they take these congress
men, and women, and senators

00:51:21.930 --> 00:51:24.055
on these junkets and all that.

00:51:24.055 --> 00:51:27.590
And they teach them to vote
the way they want them to vote.

00:51:27.590 --> 00:51:29.420
But we have to be
better than ALEC.

00:51:29.420 --> 00:51:31.360
We have to be a group.

00:51:31.360 --> 00:51:32.850
Googlers have to be a group.

00:51:32.850 --> 00:51:35.140
YouTubers have to be a group.

00:51:35.140 --> 00:51:37.335
And you have to
contact these senators

00:51:37.335 --> 00:51:40.130
and contact, like you
say, these congresspeople.

00:51:40.130 --> 00:51:42.920
And you have to see
what side are they on?

00:51:42.920 --> 00:51:45.110
And if they're not on the
side of righteousness,

00:51:45.110 --> 00:51:47.320
if they're not on
the side of truth,

00:51:47.320 --> 00:51:48.790
Google them out of office.

00:51:48.790 --> 00:51:50.400
[LAUGHTER]

00:51:50.400 --> 00:51:53.590
YouTube them out of office.

00:51:53.590 --> 00:51:55.860
You have the power to do that.

00:51:55.860 --> 00:51:58.840
Sometimes we have power, we
don't realize how much we have.

00:51:58.840 --> 00:52:01.490
You say when I'm just an
individual, how much can I do?

00:52:01.490 --> 00:52:03.706
But look at all the
individuals you know.

00:52:03.706 --> 00:52:05.890
Look at all the Facebook
people you know.

00:52:05.890 --> 00:52:09.080
Look at all the people that you
get on your YouTube channel.

00:52:09.080 --> 00:52:12.321
On Jordan Davis, we started
a Rest in Peace, Jordan Davis

00:52:12.321 --> 00:52:12.820
page.

00:52:12.820 --> 00:52:15.200
And, within about
three or four weeks,

00:52:15.200 --> 00:52:20.430
we had over 220,000
people on that page.

00:52:20.430 --> 00:52:22.380
And we're just a family.

00:52:22.380 --> 00:52:24.180
You guys have a
nation to deal with.

00:52:24.180 --> 00:52:27.366
You can Google
yourself to death.

00:52:27.366 --> 00:52:28.740
So I say you have
a lot of power.

00:52:28.740 --> 00:52:30.487
Use that power to
take money away

00:52:30.487 --> 00:52:32.820
from people that are not
thinking like you, that are not

00:52:32.820 --> 00:52:33.920
thinking about truth.

00:52:33.920 --> 00:52:35.630
And the other people that
are thinking like you,

00:52:35.630 --> 00:52:38.046
and thinking about truth, and
trying to do the right thing

00:52:38.046 --> 00:52:41.770
but don't have the backing of
the people in the mainstream

00:52:41.770 --> 00:52:44.070
media, use your Google power.

00:52:44.070 --> 00:52:46.580
Use your YouTube power,
and uplift these people,

00:52:46.580 --> 00:52:47.870
and get them in office.

00:52:47.870 --> 00:52:51.010
LUCY MCBATH: And when you
want to know something,

00:52:51.010 --> 00:52:51.900
what do you do?

00:52:51.900 --> 00:52:53.740
You Google it.

00:52:53.740 --> 00:52:54.370
Exactly.

00:52:54.370 --> 00:52:57.230
So use the resources
that you have.

00:52:57.230 --> 00:53:02.440
And, also, I always
say that our people do

00:53:02.440 --> 00:53:05.030
perish for lack of knowledge.

00:53:05.030 --> 00:53:08.360
So use the tools as
they're talking about.

00:53:08.360 --> 00:53:10.720
Google information.

00:53:10.720 --> 00:53:13.170
Make it available to
your constituents.

00:53:13.170 --> 00:53:16.650
Make it available to
organizations that

00:53:16.650 --> 00:53:18.390
are collaborating with you.

00:53:18.390 --> 00:53:20.840
Make information
available to them

00:53:20.840 --> 00:53:23.580
as to how they can
be actively involved.

00:53:23.580 --> 00:53:26.360
If there's something that you
are creating within Google,

00:53:26.360 --> 00:53:30.730
within this organization, make
it available and assessable.

00:53:30.730 --> 00:53:32.770
Use your tools.

00:53:32.770 --> 00:53:35.880
Information,
education is the key.

00:53:38.615 --> 00:53:40.240
TORRENCE BOONE: Mo,
any other thoughts?

00:53:40.240 --> 00:53:42.030
MOIRA MELTZER-COHEN: I
would second everything

00:53:42.030 --> 00:53:43.030
that has just been said.

00:53:43.030 --> 00:53:45.610
I would also add
that, for some of us,

00:53:45.610 --> 00:53:47.580
maybe the most valuable
thing we have to offer

00:53:47.580 --> 00:53:54.740
is not actually money because
not all of us are Googlers.

00:53:54.740 --> 00:53:56.850
We don't all have
this kind of platform.

00:53:56.850 --> 00:54:00.570
And probably not everyone
in this room does.

00:54:00.570 --> 00:54:04.770
But you have other really
valuable things to offer.

00:54:04.770 --> 00:54:06.680
And I just want to
get a quick check.

00:54:06.680 --> 00:54:10.060
Who was moved by the
movie you just watched?

00:54:10.060 --> 00:54:10.560
Yeah.

00:54:10.560 --> 00:54:11.200
OK.

00:54:11.200 --> 00:54:15.082
So remember how
important culture is.

00:54:15.082 --> 00:54:18.350
Ask people, engage with
people, interact with people.

00:54:18.350 --> 00:54:21.090
But, also, some of this
work-- OK, white people, I'm

00:54:21.090 --> 00:54:22.390
talking to you.

00:54:22.390 --> 00:54:23.720
[LAUGHTER]

00:54:23.720 --> 00:54:26.780
White people, some of
this is just on us.

00:54:26.780 --> 00:54:28.070
De-center yourself.

00:54:28.070 --> 00:54:30.680
Go home.

00:54:30.680 --> 00:54:32.930
Don't make people do
emotional labor for you.

00:54:32.930 --> 00:54:34.620
Don't make people educate you.

00:54:34.620 --> 00:54:35.760
Go home.

00:54:35.760 --> 00:54:36.930
Read bell hooks.

00:54:36.930 --> 00:54:39.285
There's like PDF
roundups on the internet.

00:54:39.285 --> 00:54:40.910
[APPLAUSE]

00:54:42.577 --> 00:54:44.410
You don't have to get
all academic about it.

00:54:44.410 --> 00:54:46.150
Go read all the Octavia Butler.

00:54:46.150 --> 00:54:48.880
Go read all the Nalo Hopkinson.

00:54:48.880 --> 00:54:55.750
You can enter into a
relationship with culture

00:54:55.750 --> 00:54:57.510
and educate yourself.

00:54:57.510 --> 00:55:00.010
You will never understand what
it means to be a black woman.

00:55:00.010 --> 00:55:00.790
And that's OK.

00:55:00.790 --> 00:55:02.940
But you need to
reeducate yourself, so

00:55:02.940 --> 00:55:06.190
that you can learn to see
what the universe looks

00:55:06.190 --> 00:55:09.110
like from the point of
view of a black woman,

00:55:09.110 --> 00:55:14.630
from specific black women
who are writing about it.

00:55:14.630 --> 00:55:20.810
You need to reeducate
yourself, refine your mind,

00:55:20.810 --> 00:55:23.330
exercise your
social imagination.

00:55:23.330 --> 00:55:26.850
And go home and do that
work at home by yourself.

00:55:26.850 --> 00:55:28.820
Ask questions.

00:55:28.820 --> 00:55:32.085
But, also, take
it upon yourself.

00:55:35.630 --> 00:55:38.150
You will be a better
person all the time.

00:55:38.150 --> 00:55:40.770
You guys have a saying, right?
"Google, don't be evil."

00:55:40.770 --> 00:55:41.310
TORRENCE BOONE: Right.

00:55:41.310 --> 00:55:42.768
MOIRA MELTZER-COHEN:
Don't be evil.

00:55:42.768 --> 00:55:43.930
[LAUGHTER]

00:55:45.139 --> 00:55:46.430
TORRENCE BOONE: First question.

00:55:46.430 --> 00:55:48.930
AUDIENCE: I want to thank
Jordan's parents for being here

00:55:48.930 --> 00:55:51.810
and for sharing your
story and Jordan's story.

00:55:51.810 --> 00:55:53.710
I knew the story
already, but it was just

00:55:53.710 --> 00:55:55.220
really powerful to
sit through that

00:55:55.220 --> 00:55:57.990
and get a feel for what that
process was like for you.

00:55:57.990 --> 00:56:00.000
So thank you for that.

00:56:00.000 --> 00:56:03.630
My question is I was struck
in the documentary about just

00:56:03.630 --> 00:56:05.680
the lack of humanity
that Michael Dunn had.

00:56:05.680 --> 00:56:07.610
I mean, to the very
end, seeing himself

00:56:07.610 --> 00:56:12.210
fully as a victim really
struck me as very twisted.

00:56:12.210 --> 00:56:16.340
And it made me wonder, since
he has this lack of humanity,

00:56:16.340 --> 00:56:21.020
this complete lack of ability
to relate to a Jordan Davis, who

00:56:21.020 --> 00:56:23.760
is in that courtroom besides
his family and loved ones

00:56:23.760 --> 00:56:25.330
who can relate to him?

00:56:25.330 --> 00:56:28.720
You talked already about
special prosecutors.

00:56:28.720 --> 00:56:33.050
I know that what you're
trying to change is not easy.

00:56:33.050 --> 00:56:34.920
Another angle that
I'm wondering,

00:56:34.920 --> 00:56:36.910
and I'd like to hear
your opinion about is

00:56:36.910 --> 00:56:42.260
I believe it's something like
95% of all elected prosecutors

00:56:42.260 --> 00:56:42.990
are white.

00:56:42.990 --> 00:56:45.990
And I think even the majority
of them are white men.

00:56:45.990 --> 00:56:48.310
And I'm wondering if
you think that having

00:56:48.310 --> 00:56:51.220
more diversity in
those elected positions

00:56:51.220 --> 00:56:53.290
would even be helpful.

00:56:53.290 --> 00:56:54.810
Thank you.

00:56:54.810 --> 00:56:55.810
LUCY MCBATH: Absolutely.

00:56:55.810 --> 00:56:58.820
If we go to the polls.

00:56:58.820 --> 00:57:00.990
Let's be very simple.

00:57:00.990 --> 00:57:03.520
I mean, let's be very
clear about this.

00:57:03.520 --> 00:57:08.550
Most of us will go to the
polls for federal elections.

00:57:08.550 --> 00:57:10.650
We're voting for presidents.

00:57:10.650 --> 00:57:12.780
But we're not voting on
the state and local level

00:57:12.780 --> 00:57:20.110
where all of these individuals
are being placed in office.

00:57:20.110 --> 00:57:25.380
So, if we're not voting, then
we're not using our voice.

00:57:25.380 --> 00:57:30.400
If we're not using our voice,
there is no effective change.

00:57:30.400 --> 00:57:32.610
RON DAVIS: And you
can see change.

00:57:32.610 --> 00:57:35.240
I can't remember the
name of the judge.

00:57:35.240 --> 00:57:37.780
It's somewhere in the South.

00:57:37.780 --> 00:57:39.600
But, anyway, this
judge recently,

00:57:39.600 --> 00:57:43.480
within the last two months,
had a case where this black man

00:57:43.480 --> 00:57:46.280
was with the defendant.

00:57:46.280 --> 00:57:48.660
And so the prosecutors
in these cases,

00:57:48.660 --> 00:57:51.160
they all have 10 strikes.

00:57:51.160 --> 00:57:55.540
And, more times than not,
they use all the strikes

00:57:55.540 --> 00:57:57.762
against African Americans.

00:57:57.762 --> 00:57:59.220
Sometimes you look
at these juries,

00:57:59.220 --> 00:58:00.490
you say, well, how come
it's an all white jury?

00:58:00.490 --> 00:58:03.240
How come there's only one
black person on the jury?

00:58:03.240 --> 00:58:06.670
Well, if a prosecutor
looks at that,

00:58:06.670 --> 00:58:08.710
and the defense attorney
says, you know what?

00:58:08.710 --> 00:58:11.490
I'm going to get
this guy prosecuted.

00:58:11.490 --> 00:58:14.680
I'm going to get this
guy to go to prison.

00:58:14.680 --> 00:58:18.970
I'm going to use all my
strikes on black people.

00:58:18.970 --> 00:58:23.060
And, as long as it's not
racially given to the judge,

00:58:23.060 --> 00:58:25.840
and he uses all the
excuses in the world--

00:58:25.840 --> 00:58:28.302
do you know anybody that
ever been in prison?

00:58:28.302 --> 00:58:31.420
Uncle Leroy, has
he been in prison?

00:58:31.420 --> 00:58:34.950
Has Choo Choo been in prison?

00:58:34.950 --> 00:58:39.866
All these things to
bamboozle the judge.

00:58:39.866 --> 00:58:40.990
But they get those strikes.

00:58:40.990 --> 00:58:42.781
And that's why, in the
Trayvon Martin case,

00:58:42.781 --> 00:58:44.320
you had basically
an all white jury.

00:58:44.320 --> 00:58:46.960
In our case, out of 12
people, there were two black.

00:58:46.960 --> 00:58:48.832
These are things-- we sit there.

00:58:48.832 --> 00:58:50.290
As parents, we
watch these strikes.

00:58:50.290 --> 00:58:51.920
We attended it.

00:58:51.920 --> 00:58:53.820
They kept striking,
striking, striking.

00:58:53.820 --> 00:58:59.060
They used 98.9% of their strikes
against African Americans.

00:58:59.060 --> 00:59:01.380
So sometimes it's not us not
trying to get on the jury.

00:59:01.380 --> 00:59:03.592
They won't let us on the jury.

00:59:03.592 --> 00:59:04.550
LUCY MCBATH: I'm sorry.

00:59:04.550 --> 00:59:07.950
But, even to your point
before, this was something

00:59:07.950 --> 00:59:10.620
that we were very
disheartened by

00:59:10.620 --> 00:59:13.320
is that, in both
jury selections,

00:59:13.320 --> 00:59:15.900
we sat through those
jury selections.

00:59:15.900 --> 00:59:21.499
And our people did everything
they could to not be on our--

00:59:21.499 --> 00:59:23.040
RON DAVIS: Well,
they tell the truth.

00:59:23.040 --> 00:59:24.460
See, what happens
is, when you're

00:59:24.460 --> 00:59:27.170
in court, African
Americans-- you go in,

00:59:27.170 --> 00:59:29.767
and you start telling the truth.

00:59:29.767 --> 00:59:32.100
Sometimes that gets you off
the jury, telling the truth.

00:59:32.100 --> 00:59:33.725
Have you heard anything
about the case?

00:59:33.725 --> 00:59:35.192
Yeah.

00:59:35.192 --> 00:59:37.150
I was at my mama's house,
and I heard about it.

00:59:37.150 --> 00:59:38.320
Strike.

00:59:38.320 --> 00:59:41.710
White people, a lot of times,
they want to be on the jury.

00:59:41.710 --> 00:59:43.580
And they lie that they-- no, no.

00:59:43.580 --> 00:59:45.430
I was up in the hills
in Montana, never

00:59:45.430 --> 00:59:47.580
heard anything
about Jordan Davis.

00:59:47.580 --> 00:59:48.999
They want to get on the jury.

00:59:48.999 --> 00:59:50.290
So we have to think about that.

00:59:50.290 --> 00:59:52.540
Sometimes maybe you have to
tell that little white lie

00:59:52.540 --> 00:59:53.410
to get on the jury.

00:59:53.410 --> 00:59:54.790
Don't be so honest.

00:59:54.790 --> 00:59:58.830
I see a lot of honest
people get off the jury.

00:59:58.830 --> 01:00:01.430
But this African American
judge-- going back to that--

01:00:01.430 --> 01:00:04.330
is that he did
make a difference.

01:00:04.330 --> 01:00:07.010
With this all white jury, and
with this black defendant,

01:00:07.010 --> 01:00:10.050
he actually stepped up
and said, you know what?

01:00:10.050 --> 01:00:12.870
I'm going take a
recess, and I'm going

01:00:12.870 --> 01:00:15.020
to dismiss the jury,
he said, because I

01:00:15.020 --> 01:00:17.940
don't believe this young
man is getting a fair trial.

01:00:17.940 --> 01:00:20.640
So if you Google that,
this happened recently.

01:00:20.640 --> 01:00:23.690
And he wanted to
empanel another jury

01:00:23.690 --> 01:00:27.750
that was fairly representing of
that city and of that county.

01:00:27.750 --> 01:00:28.250
So, yeah.

01:00:28.250 --> 01:00:32.200
It does make a difference if
we can have a lot of jurors

01:00:32.200 --> 01:00:35.214
do that and have a lot of
judges do that, I mean.

01:00:35.214 --> 01:00:37.130
LINDA SARSOUR: Can I
just add one quick thing?

01:00:37.130 --> 01:00:38.255
TORRENCE BOONE: Yeah, yeah.

01:00:38.255 --> 01:00:40.390
Sure.

01:00:40.390 --> 01:00:43.350
LINDA SARSOUR: Michael Dunn
was engaging, displaying

01:00:43.350 --> 01:00:44.670
straight white supremacy.

01:00:44.670 --> 01:00:46.010
He wasn't acting like a victim.

01:00:46.010 --> 01:00:48.075
He straight believed
that, as a white man,

01:00:48.075 --> 01:00:50.200
he could pull out a gun,
and shoot some black kids,

01:00:50.200 --> 01:00:51.950
and nothing was going
to happen to him.

01:00:51.950 --> 01:00:54.116
And this is the problem
that we have in this country

01:00:54.116 --> 01:00:56.030
that immediately when
a white person shoots

01:00:56.030 --> 01:00:59.010
a person of color, we start
being like he twisted.

01:00:59.010 --> 01:00:59.959
He crazy.

01:00:59.959 --> 01:01:01.000
I don't know what he did.

01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:02.000
He was mad at his wife.

01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:04.380
And we try to make all
these excuses for them.

01:01:04.380 --> 01:01:05.930
They believe they can do this.

01:01:05.930 --> 01:01:08.290
A white police
officer believes he's

01:01:08.290 --> 01:01:10.090
going to shoot a
black unarmed kid

01:01:10.090 --> 01:01:12.690
and get away with it because
he's going to get away with it.

01:01:12.690 --> 01:01:16.990
So sometimes we
internalize that.

01:01:16.990 --> 01:01:18.700
But when I was listening
to Michael Dunn,

01:01:18.700 --> 01:01:20.630
I was listening to white
supremacy, straight-up.

01:01:20.630 --> 01:01:21.760
That's exactly what it is.

01:01:21.760 --> 01:01:25.440
So I feel like we need to call
it that every time, every time.

01:01:25.440 --> 01:01:29.420
White supremacy is the common
enemy up here for all of us

01:01:29.420 --> 01:01:32.290
when we look at people talking
about deporting immigrants,

01:01:32.290 --> 01:01:34.150
killing unarmed kids
and justifying it,

01:01:34.150 --> 01:01:37.730
whether it's white males killing
black teenagers because they're

01:01:37.730 --> 01:01:40.450
listening to loud music like
we hear every day in Brooklyn,

01:01:40.450 --> 01:01:42.367
this is white supremacy,
sisters and brothers.

01:01:42.367 --> 01:01:43.908
And we've got to
just keep calling it

01:01:43.908 --> 01:01:44.825
that every single day.

01:01:44.825 --> 01:01:46.450
RON DAVIS: And it's
domestic terrorism.

01:01:46.450 --> 01:01:47.850
LINDA SARSOUR:
Domestic terrorism.

01:01:47.850 --> 01:01:50.516
MOIRA MELTZER-COHEN: And I would
like to just add to that, also,

01:01:50.516 --> 01:01:52.800
to complicate this a little bit.

01:01:52.800 --> 01:01:57.210
In your situation,
the white supremacist

01:01:57.210 --> 01:02:00.130
was the criminal defendant.

01:02:00.130 --> 01:02:02.310
And that's actually
fairly unusual.

01:02:02.310 --> 01:02:05.980
Usually the white supremacist is
the prosecutor side, the police

01:02:05.980 --> 01:02:08.800
system.

01:02:08.800 --> 01:02:12.230
And so I think that, Linda,
what you just said really

01:02:12.230 --> 01:02:13.910
helps to clarify.

01:02:13.910 --> 01:02:18.310
It's not that we're anti-defense
attorney or anti-prosecutor.

01:02:18.310 --> 01:02:21.050
It's that this
system, as adversarial

01:02:21.050 --> 01:02:26.080
as it is said to be, is simply
one face of white supremacy.

01:02:26.080 --> 01:02:29.140
And I do think it's important
for all of us, and especially

01:02:29.140 --> 01:02:32.340
white people, to
get real and start

01:02:32.340 --> 01:02:33.480
calling it white supremacy.

01:02:33.480 --> 01:02:33.980
TORRENCE BOONE: Yep.

01:02:33.980 --> 01:02:35.650
LUMUMBA AKINWOLE-BANDELE: And
I'll just add really quickly

01:02:35.650 --> 01:02:36.690
to answer your question.

01:02:36.690 --> 01:02:39.451
We've said the same thing about
diversifying racially police

01:02:39.451 --> 01:02:39.950
forces.

01:02:39.950 --> 01:02:43.050
And we've recognized that it
has significant limitations.

01:02:43.050 --> 01:02:45.910
And so black prosecutors
will probably

01:02:45.910 --> 01:02:47.500
help in some manner
on some level.

01:02:47.500 --> 01:02:52.170
But until we actually address
the full systemic issues

01:02:52.170 --> 01:02:55.740
with the prosecution and the
criminalization of black folks,

01:02:55.740 --> 01:02:58.240
black folks will continue just
to provide that same function

01:02:58.240 --> 01:02:59.850
in that particular system.

01:02:59.850 --> 01:03:00.750
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

01:03:00.750 --> 01:03:01.919
TORRENCE BOONE: Yes?

01:03:01.919 --> 01:03:02.460
AUDIENCE: Hi.

01:03:02.460 --> 01:03:03.334
My name is Stephanie.

01:03:03.334 --> 01:03:06.000
I'm a drug policy activist, as
well as a former Google student

01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:08.040
ambassador.

01:03:08.040 --> 01:03:10.590
I guess my question is,
Ron mentioned earlier

01:03:10.590 --> 01:03:17.260
before the movie started how
oftentimes the media victimizes

01:03:17.260 --> 01:03:19.810
the victims for having
drugs in their system,

01:03:19.810 --> 01:03:22.590
whether it be alcohol, marijuana
as we saw in the Michael Brown

01:03:22.590 --> 01:03:23.930
case.

01:03:23.930 --> 01:03:27.806
One, how is this movement,
Black Lives Matters as well as

01:03:27.806 --> 01:03:29.180
the work that you do,

01:03:29.180 --> 01:03:30.800
I guess, talking
about these issues,

01:03:30.800 --> 01:03:33.860
about drugs, especially in
light of marijuana legalization

01:03:33.860 --> 01:03:36.280
happening at a
nation scale coupled

01:03:36.280 --> 01:03:39.160
with capitalism that is
entering as the industry that

01:03:39.160 --> 01:03:40.570
is growing?

01:03:40.570 --> 01:03:42.575
And then, following that
question, all of you

01:03:42.575 --> 01:03:44.530
have mentioned being
part of the system,

01:03:44.530 --> 01:03:47.320
whether it's being in your
elected officials office,

01:03:47.320 --> 01:03:49.300
whether it's being on jury duty.

01:03:49.300 --> 01:03:51.780
How do you ensure that
you are within the system

01:03:51.780 --> 01:03:53.870
but, at the same time, not
co-opted by the system?

01:03:57.522 --> 01:04:00.610
RON DAVIS: When I look at--
I think about Muhammad Ali,

01:04:00.610 --> 01:04:02.840
what he said years
ago-- he said why

01:04:02.840 --> 01:04:05.341
do you think they call it dope?

01:04:05.341 --> 01:04:08.860
You're a dope if that's
what you do because they use

01:04:08.860 --> 01:04:11.680
that to justify your murder.

01:04:11.680 --> 01:04:18.680
They justify your value to the
world if you're a dopehead.

01:04:18.680 --> 01:04:19.820
I can kill him.

01:04:19.820 --> 01:04:21.200
Michael Dunn, what did he say?

01:04:21.200 --> 01:04:23.417
He says, well, if I
didn't kill Jordan,

01:04:23.417 --> 01:04:25.125
maybe he could have
killed somebody else,

01:04:25.125 --> 01:04:27.474
so I'm doing a public service.

01:04:27.474 --> 01:04:28.890
Do you understand
what that means?

01:04:28.890 --> 01:04:32.240
That means that Jordan's life
didn't matter regardless,

01:04:32.240 --> 01:04:35.220
whether he had a shotgun,
a pipe, or whatever.

01:04:35.220 --> 01:04:37.550
It's just his life didn't
matter to a white supremest,

01:04:37.550 --> 01:04:39.490
to a domestic terrorist.

01:04:39.490 --> 01:04:44.592
And so when you look at
the aggravated part of it

01:04:44.592 --> 01:04:47.050
because the first thing they're
going to do is a toxicology

01:04:47.050 --> 01:04:48.930
and find out what you
had in your system,

01:04:48.930 --> 01:04:51.470
not what the shooter
had in his system.

01:04:51.470 --> 01:04:54.950
Never find out-- Walter Scott
was shot in the back six times.

01:04:54.950 --> 01:04:58.120
They didn't find out what he
had in his system to this day,

01:04:58.120 --> 01:05:00.970
but Walter Scott had a
little alcohol in his system,

01:05:00.970 --> 01:05:05.320
had a little Cocaine, about as
much as Leon Spinks would take,

01:05:05.320 --> 01:05:06.320
a little bit.

01:05:06.320 --> 01:05:07.840
But they never say that.

01:05:07.840 --> 01:05:13.890
And so I tell people it
doesn't devalue your life

01:05:13.890 --> 01:05:16.530
if you have something
in your system.

01:05:16.530 --> 01:05:19.640
It's never a case that you
should be shot at, killed,

01:05:19.640 --> 01:05:21.905
whatever the case may
be, and we sit up here

01:05:21.905 --> 01:05:27.779
and let them narrate the
story of why you were killed.

01:05:27.779 --> 01:05:28.320
I don't care.

01:05:28.320 --> 01:05:32.640
The biggest dopehead on the
street deserves to live.

01:05:32.640 --> 01:05:34.140
So that's an excuse to kill.

01:05:34.140 --> 01:05:37.970
But that's the excuse that
they make why we killed them.

01:05:37.970 --> 01:05:42.970
And so when you look at
situations like Mr. Daniel

01:05:42.970 --> 01:05:48.910
Holtzclaw in Oklahoma
City that decides

01:05:48.910 --> 01:05:51.260
I'm going to go in
a drug infested area

01:05:51.260 --> 01:05:54.430
and start raping
black prostitutes

01:05:54.430 --> 01:05:58.990
and start sodomizing black
drug users because guess what?

01:05:58.990 --> 01:06:00.200
Their life don't matter.

01:06:00.200 --> 01:06:01.180
AUDIENCE: Right.

01:06:01.180 --> 01:06:03.430
RON DAVIS: Nobody's going
to believe them because they

01:06:03.430 --> 01:06:05.090
have drugs in their system.

01:06:05.090 --> 01:06:06.240
But you know what?

01:06:06.240 --> 01:06:07.510
Daniel, you're wrong.

01:06:07.510 --> 01:06:07.855
AUDIENCE: That's right.

01:06:07.855 --> 01:06:08.646
LINDA SARSOUR: Yep.

01:06:08.646 --> 01:06:10.910
RON DAVIS: Convicted of
raping and sodomizing

01:06:10.910 --> 01:06:15.590
13 African American women
in Oklahoma City, guilty

01:06:15.590 --> 01:06:17.610
as charged.

01:06:17.610 --> 01:06:18.790
So you can affect change.

01:06:18.790 --> 01:06:20.910
And I think change is coming.

01:06:20.910 --> 01:06:24.910
And I say, unlike the
old women in the church,

01:06:24.910 --> 01:06:26.860
they say wait for change.

01:06:26.860 --> 01:06:28.660
I say go get change.

01:06:28.660 --> 01:06:30.360
Go get change.

01:06:30.360 --> 01:06:31.860
LUMUMBA AKINWOLE-BANDELE:
I'm sorry.

01:06:31.860 --> 01:06:33.800
If I can, really quickly,
your last comment

01:06:33.800 --> 01:06:35.508
about how do you
interact with the system

01:06:35.508 --> 01:06:39.030
without becoming--
the language I chose

01:06:39.030 --> 01:06:41.799
is very specific in attention
when I talked about your tools.

01:06:41.799 --> 01:06:43.840
And I'm going to take my
LDF hat off for a minute

01:06:43.840 --> 01:06:47.070
because I can't represent them
with what I'm about to say.

01:06:47.070 --> 01:06:49.800
We are at war.

01:06:49.800 --> 01:06:51.010
We are at war.

01:06:51.010 --> 01:06:52.840
And we need to be
very clear about how

01:06:52.840 --> 01:06:55.720
we engage in this warfare.

01:06:55.720 --> 01:06:59.700
One particular strategy is
not going to win the war.

01:06:59.700 --> 01:07:03.590
We have to look at every single
mechanism we have available.

01:07:03.590 --> 01:07:04.610
Look at your tool.

01:07:04.610 --> 01:07:05.780
Master your tool.

01:07:05.780 --> 01:07:08.244
Engage in it.

01:07:08.244 --> 01:07:10.232
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

01:07:10.232 --> 01:07:11.190
AUDIENCE: Good evening.

01:07:11.190 --> 01:07:12.380
My name is Morgan.

01:07:12.380 --> 01:07:15.340
First of all, I wanted to
thank Jordan Davis's parents

01:07:15.340 --> 01:07:18.120
for coming out and having the
strength and courage to share

01:07:18.120 --> 01:07:20.240
your story with us.

01:07:20.240 --> 01:07:24.650
Secondly, my question is
about a call to action.

01:07:24.650 --> 01:07:27.930
I was wondering-- you guys
mentioned certain strategies

01:07:27.930 --> 01:07:31.800
that we should take as people
to fight this injustice,

01:07:31.800 --> 01:07:33.910
fight this social injustice.

01:07:33.910 --> 01:07:36.050
But, as a young
person, I constantly

01:07:36.050 --> 01:07:42.010
find myself sort of helpless
in figuring out what to do.

01:07:42.010 --> 01:07:45.160
I just graduated college,
and they educate us

01:07:45.160 --> 01:07:46.360
all about the system.

01:07:46.360 --> 01:07:50.030
And they tell us call a spade
a spade, blah, blah blah.

01:07:50.030 --> 01:07:52.140
I know the system in and
out, but I'm not really

01:07:52.140 --> 01:07:55.130
sure what to do about it.

01:07:55.130 --> 01:07:57.140
And so I was wondering
if you could--

01:07:57.140 --> 01:08:00.320
I know you guys briefly
touched on some of the things

01:08:00.320 --> 01:08:03.720
that you suggested
for calls to action.

01:08:03.720 --> 01:08:07.610
But, as a young person, what are
you guys looking for us to do?

01:08:07.610 --> 01:08:10.820
I know, personally, my
career path does not

01:08:10.820 --> 01:08:13.590
involve law or anything.

01:08:13.590 --> 01:08:16.319
But that does not take
away from my passion

01:08:16.319 --> 01:08:18.859
for fighting this injustice.

01:08:18.859 --> 01:08:20.950
LUCY MCBATH: I work for
Everytown for gun safety.

01:08:20.950 --> 01:08:24.899
And, actually, I'm a
national spokesperson

01:08:24.899 --> 01:08:29.510
in Community of Faith
outreach organizer for them.

01:08:29.510 --> 01:08:32.760
And we give you lots of
tools that you can use.

01:08:32.760 --> 01:08:35.720
And you don't have to
necessarily do what any of us

01:08:35.720 --> 01:08:37.180
does.

01:08:37.180 --> 01:08:40.240
And, as he said,
it takes everybody

01:08:40.240 --> 01:08:42.939
working in their
own lane to create

01:08:42.939 --> 01:08:44.810
the changes that we need.

01:08:44.810 --> 01:08:47.310
But you can be
involved in campaigns

01:08:47.310 --> 01:08:51.010
around the country, campaigns
for gun violence prevention,

01:08:51.010 --> 01:08:55.100
campaigns against policing,
campaigns and rallies.

01:08:55.100 --> 01:08:56.779
You can do those things.

01:08:56.779 --> 01:08:59.520
You can definitely go
to the polls and vote.

01:08:59.520 --> 01:09:01.160
You definitely have that tool.

01:09:01.160 --> 01:09:02.819
That's extremely important.

01:09:02.819 --> 01:09:08.529
So everytown.org, go on
that website right there,

01:09:08.529 --> 01:09:10.229
and you can find
different ways that you

01:09:10.229 --> 01:09:14.240
can be actively involved,
even if it's just

01:09:14.240 --> 01:09:17.729
tweeting your legislator and
saying I'm unhappy with what's

01:09:17.729 --> 01:09:21.010
happening in my community,
sending them Facebook posts,

01:09:21.010 --> 01:09:23.340
even if you just want
to call your legislator.

01:09:23.340 --> 01:09:25.310
You can do all those
kinds of things.

01:09:25.310 --> 01:09:30.600
And, particularly, social
media is the biggest proponent

01:09:30.600 --> 01:09:32.569
for cultural change
in this country.

01:09:32.569 --> 01:09:35.180
And you all are experts at that.

01:09:35.180 --> 01:09:39.490
So definitely continue
to create a movement.

01:09:39.490 --> 01:09:41.100
You can do that.

01:09:41.100 --> 01:09:45.149
You can be posting your
friends, and tweeting,

01:09:45.149 --> 01:09:48.069
and talking about the
ills and everything

01:09:48.069 --> 01:09:49.970
that you see happening
in your communities,

01:09:49.970 --> 01:09:52.760
and in society, and
with people of color.

01:09:52.760 --> 01:09:55.930
That's what you can do.

01:09:55.930 --> 01:09:58.710
RON DAVIS: Some of
these online places--

01:09:58.710 --> 01:10:02.040
I looked at a site that
I'm very familiar with,

01:10:02.040 --> 01:10:04.840
the creator of the site,
Urban Cusp-- -C-U-S-P.

01:10:04.840 --> 01:10:06.400
[LAUGHTER]

01:10:06.400 --> 01:10:07.690
Very familiar with that site.

01:10:07.690 --> 01:10:10.790
One of the good things
that she does, and I think

01:10:10.790 --> 01:10:13.517
would help young people-- see,
I've got to give you the plug.

01:10:13.517 --> 01:10:14.830
[LAUGHTER]

01:10:14.830 --> 01:10:15.760
There you go.

01:10:15.760 --> 01:10:18.710
But they have cards
and stuff, and they say

01:10:18.710 --> 01:10:20.260
print these cards
to tell you what

01:10:20.260 --> 01:10:22.880
to do in case you're
stopped by a cop that

01:10:22.880 --> 01:10:26.540
may be a domestic terrorist,
a white supremest.

01:10:26.540 --> 01:10:28.350
They have these
cards that tell you--

01:10:28.350 --> 01:10:31.410
I even say go hand out
the cards to people

01:10:31.410 --> 01:10:34.047
in urban areas, people that
are in poverty that may not

01:10:34.047 --> 01:10:36.380
know what to do, and may not
know what their rights are.

01:10:36.380 --> 01:10:37.171
Hand out the cards.

01:10:37.171 --> 01:10:39.230
And, on the back,
have a phone number

01:10:39.230 --> 01:10:42.960
of a lawyer in a local city
because that helps the people

01:10:42.960 --> 01:10:46.020
because a lot of the people
get killed because they

01:10:46.020 --> 01:10:47.060
don't know what to do.

01:10:47.060 --> 01:10:51.170
When they see the red, blue,
and white lights, they panic.

01:10:51.170 --> 01:10:52.560
And running can get you killed.

01:10:52.560 --> 01:10:55.549
Running while black--
it can get you killed.

01:10:55.549 --> 01:10:57.340
There used to be a time
in the cowboy days,

01:10:57.340 --> 01:10:58.965
you get shot in the
back, that's wrong.

01:10:58.965 --> 01:11:00.070
But not now.

01:11:00.070 --> 01:11:02.110
You get shot in the
back all the time.

01:11:02.110 --> 01:11:05.450
So, as I told Jordan in the
film when I was in the swimming

01:11:05.450 --> 01:11:07.910
pool, protect yourself.

01:11:07.910 --> 01:11:09.710
That will hurt me
to my dying days

01:11:09.710 --> 01:11:12.260
that Jordan didn't
listen to his dad.

01:11:12.260 --> 01:11:14.370
When I say protect
yourself, all occasion

01:11:14.370 --> 01:11:16.600
doesn't call for you to be loud.

01:11:16.600 --> 01:11:21.320
All occasion doesn't call
for you to exert your rights.

01:11:21.320 --> 01:11:23.904
Because, at the end
of the day, Morgan,

01:11:23.904 --> 01:11:25.570
I want you to come
home to your parents.

01:11:25.570 --> 01:11:28.440
Do you understand what I mean?

01:11:28.440 --> 01:11:30.100
At the end of the day, OK.

01:11:30.100 --> 01:11:32.650
So go to those sites
and know your rights.

01:11:32.650 --> 01:11:35.690
And you may think
you're being wrong,

01:11:35.690 --> 01:11:38.690
but there's a forum to show
where you're being wrong.

01:11:38.690 --> 01:11:41.990
But, at the time that
you're in the bright lights

01:11:41.990 --> 01:11:46.860
where the person is not
wearing a hood like the KKK

01:11:46.860 --> 01:11:49.500
but he's wearing
a badge and a gun,

01:11:49.500 --> 01:11:51.320
you've got to let
him win that day.

01:11:51.320 --> 01:11:55.437
But you win the fight later on
and go home to your parents.

01:11:55.437 --> 01:11:56.270
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

01:11:56.270 --> 01:11:58.061
MOIRA MELTZER-COHEN:
I want to add to that,

01:11:58.061 --> 01:11:59.514
too you're not
going to-- well, I

01:11:59.514 --> 01:12:00.930
don't want to say
you're not going

01:12:00.930 --> 01:12:03.520
to-- but you shouldn't
expect yourself to change

01:12:03.520 --> 01:12:05.230
the system all by yourself.

01:12:05.230 --> 01:12:06.550
You're not alone.

01:12:06.550 --> 01:12:08.610
And one thing that
everyone can do,

01:12:08.610 --> 01:12:11.770
and I would encourage
you to do safely

01:12:11.770 --> 01:12:17.760
is to film the police because
the one thing that does

01:12:17.760 --> 01:12:23.330
seem to bring about-- too
slow, too little, too late,

01:12:23.330 --> 01:12:25.600
but it seems to
work a little bit--

01:12:25.600 --> 01:12:28.370
is sunshine, sunshine, sunshine.

01:12:28.370 --> 01:12:29.170
Film those police.

01:12:29.170 --> 01:12:31.492
AUDIENCE: It kind
of pisses them off.

01:12:31.492 --> 01:12:32.700
MOIRA MELTZER-COHEN: It does.

01:12:32.700 --> 01:12:34.925
Film them from a safe distance.

01:12:34.925 --> 01:12:36.800
TORRENCE BOONE: So we're
going to try and get

01:12:36.800 --> 01:12:37.880
in the last questions.

01:12:37.880 --> 01:12:39.840
So why don't we go here.

01:12:39.840 --> 01:12:41.260
AUDIENCE: Hi, everybody.

01:12:41.260 --> 01:12:45.664
This question-- well, thank
you for Jordan Davis' parents

01:12:45.664 --> 01:12:47.580
to come and all the way
out to the East coast.

01:12:47.580 --> 01:12:49.246
I know it's been very
long for you guys,

01:12:49.246 --> 01:12:51.730
but I'm going to make it very
brief and very to the point.

01:12:51.730 --> 01:12:53.396
I'm a high school
teacher in New Jersey,

01:12:53.396 --> 01:12:54.480
and I teach engineering.

01:12:54.480 --> 01:12:56.420
And I have a lot
of diverse faces

01:12:56.420 --> 01:12:59.870
in my classroom, especially
young African American boys,

01:12:59.870 --> 01:13:06.320
and, particularly, Islamic
women, and young men.

01:13:06.320 --> 01:13:09.420
My question is that, since
there's a lot a crimes

01:13:09.420 --> 01:13:11.470
not only going against
African American boys,

01:13:11.470 --> 01:13:15.520
but the huge Trump
quote about banning

01:13:15.520 --> 01:13:18.710
Muslims, the rampant
Islamophobia,

01:13:18.710 --> 01:13:20.910
especially with-- I
don't know if everybody's

01:13:20.910 --> 01:13:23.710
familiar with this-- but
Ahmed Mohamed, the kid that

01:13:23.710 --> 01:13:25.130
made a clock in Texas.

01:13:25.130 --> 01:13:27.570
And this teacher
thought it was a bomb.

01:13:27.570 --> 01:13:28.850
And he was arrested.

01:13:28.850 --> 01:13:32.200
And, by the grace of God, he's
doing bigger and better things,

01:13:32.200 --> 01:13:34.470
getting a scholarship and
meeting the president.

01:13:34.470 --> 01:13:38.940
One thing that I have is
talk about to my students,

01:13:38.940 --> 01:13:42.610
especially the boys of color,
and of different ethnicities,

01:13:42.610 --> 01:13:44.600
and religions is perception.

01:13:44.600 --> 01:13:49.690
And some of my kids come
in there with a stereo set,

01:13:49.690 --> 01:13:51.310
pants sagging down.

01:13:51.310 --> 01:13:56.130
And I see a lot of young ladies,
Linda, who wear the hijab.

01:13:56.130 --> 01:13:59.070
So my question to you
guys is how important

01:13:59.070 --> 01:14:04.326
is the discussion between us
and our youth today, especially

01:14:04.326 --> 01:14:05.700
people of color
about perception,

01:14:05.700 --> 01:14:08.030
about how we carry
ourselves, and how

01:14:08.030 --> 01:14:10.670
certain people who may not be
familiar with those different

01:14:10.670 --> 01:14:11.927
backgrounds perceive us?

01:14:11.927 --> 01:14:13.760
And that's especially
for Ron and for Linda.

01:14:17.750 --> 01:14:20.190
LINDA SARSOUR: I think Lumumba
was saying this earlier.

01:14:20.190 --> 01:14:22.460
And it's a really
important point for me.

01:14:22.460 --> 01:14:24.660
And I fight with people
all the time about this.

01:14:24.660 --> 01:14:28.050
But I'm never going to tell a
kid to pick up his pants ever.

01:14:28.050 --> 01:14:30.820
He can wear his pants down
to here if he wants to.

01:14:30.820 --> 01:14:34.110
I mean, I think that
for-- and the reason why

01:14:34.110 --> 01:14:36.340
I say that, is that for
women who wear a hijab,

01:14:36.340 --> 01:14:38.130
it ain't like we
just wear it whenever

01:14:38.130 --> 01:14:39.796
we feel like because
we think it's cute.

01:14:39.796 --> 01:14:41.510
This is a part of
our religion, right?

01:14:41.510 --> 01:14:43.702
And I'm not saying the
way you wear your pants is

01:14:43.702 --> 01:14:44.310
part of your religion.

01:14:44.310 --> 01:14:46.560
But if it's how you want to
do it, this is a free country.

01:14:46.560 --> 01:14:48.210
You can wear your
pants, not wear pants.

01:14:48.210 --> 01:14:49.430
You can do whatever you want.

01:14:49.430 --> 01:14:51.970
And I think that if we
continue to teach our kids what

01:14:51.970 --> 01:14:55.680
the right way to look like is,
or how high you put your pants,

01:14:55.680 --> 01:15:00.180
and to whose standards, and
who's the audience that's

01:15:00.180 --> 01:15:02.430
supposed to be perceiving
you, that's a problem for me

01:15:02.430 --> 01:15:04.930
because right now, I'm hearing
young women-- people probably

01:15:04.930 --> 01:15:07.670
see this on Facebook-- they're
putting out safety tips,

01:15:07.670 --> 01:15:09.300
like when you're
walking in the street,

01:15:09.300 --> 01:15:11.390
don't stand too close too
close to the train platform.

01:15:11.390 --> 01:15:13.556
Wait until the train gets
there to get on the train.

01:15:13.556 --> 01:15:15.020
This is United
States of America.

01:15:15.020 --> 01:15:16.936
We're not supposed to
be walking around-- this

01:15:16.936 --> 01:15:18.190
ain't no third world country.

01:15:18.190 --> 01:15:21.850
So I think for our kids, this
important idea of-- you're

01:15:21.850 --> 01:15:22.590
their role model.

01:15:22.590 --> 01:15:23.470
You're a black man.

01:15:23.470 --> 01:15:25.860
You're a high school teacher.

01:15:25.860 --> 01:15:26.789
They look up to you.

01:15:26.789 --> 01:15:28.580
And I think whatever
you're doing for them,

01:15:28.580 --> 01:15:31.081
and just being there for them,
and letting them be, I think,

01:15:31.081 --> 01:15:33.246
is the most important thing
that we do for our kids.

01:15:33.246 --> 01:15:35.740
I tell my young woman all the
time-- I said, you know what?

01:15:35.740 --> 01:15:38.114
I said, I'm going to walk out
on the streets of New York.

01:15:38.114 --> 01:15:40.230
I'm going to look
just like this.

01:15:40.230 --> 01:15:42.392
I'm not saying that my
safety is not at risk.

01:15:42.392 --> 01:15:43.850
But I want to be
in a country where

01:15:43.850 --> 01:15:48.290
I'm unapologetically who I am,
I'm unapologetically Muslim.

01:15:48.290 --> 01:15:51.170
I want young black men to
be unapologetically black.

01:15:51.170 --> 01:15:54.099
And I want young woman to
be unapologetic black women,

01:15:54.099 --> 01:15:55.640
Muslim women, whatever
woman you are.

01:15:55.640 --> 01:16:00.080
So I think we can't keep
this idea of like how to act

01:16:00.080 --> 01:16:02.650
and how to be because
we're always telling people

01:16:02.650 --> 01:16:07.090
to act how the white
man wants us to act.

01:16:07.090 --> 01:16:08.170
This is just who I am.

01:16:08.170 --> 01:16:10.044
This is how I'm going
to be every single day.

01:16:10.044 --> 01:16:13.630
So I think just encouraging
kids, making the space for them

01:16:13.630 --> 01:16:15.500
in your class to
be who they are.

01:16:15.500 --> 01:16:17.709
And maybe they're not safe
outside of your classroom.

01:16:17.709 --> 01:16:20.041
But if you're like, oh, that
hijab you're wearing today,

01:16:20.041 --> 01:16:20.920
I love that color.

01:16:20.920 --> 01:16:22.170
You just look good in that.

01:16:22.170 --> 01:16:23.320
I really like that one.

01:16:26.357 --> 01:16:28.940
When I'm walking in the streets
of New York City, and somebody

01:16:28.940 --> 01:16:31.360
opens a door for me, and
there's a young black man that

01:16:31.360 --> 01:16:32.510
opens the door for
me, and I walk by,

01:16:32.510 --> 01:16:33.820
and I say thank you, brother.

01:16:33.820 --> 01:16:35.190
That means the world to me.

01:16:35.190 --> 01:16:36.250
You have no idea.

01:16:36.250 --> 01:16:40.060
That very simple act
of just normal behavior

01:16:40.060 --> 01:16:41.150
means the world to people.

01:16:41.150 --> 01:16:42.960
And when I see a
young black man,

01:16:42.960 --> 01:16:44.500
and I want to open
the door for him,

01:16:44.500 --> 01:16:48.070
he looks at me like--
he just gives me

01:16:48.070 --> 01:16:50.570
that look, that kind of like
understanding that we have

01:16:50.570 --> 01:16:52.794
that I respected him,
that I valued who he was.

01:16:52.794 --> 01:16:54.710
This time, I'm going to
open the door for you.

01:16:54.710 --> 01:16:56.500
I think it's
important how we treat

01:16:56.500 --> 01:16:57.790
our people to be valuable.

01:16:57.790 --> 01:17:00.350
We're always looking at the
approval from the outside,

01:17:00.350 --> 01:17:02.597
but I want my own
people to love me.

01:17:02.597 --> 01:17:03.930
I don't care about anybody else.

01:17:03.930 --> 01:17:04.810
I want to love me.

01:17:04.810 --> 01:17:06.807
I want my people to love me.

01:17:06.807 --> 01:17:08.498
I want other people to love me.

01:17:08.498 --> 01:17:11.740
And if we love each other,
we've got each other's back,

01:17:11.740 --> 01:17:14.390
ain't nobody can
do anything to us.

01:17:14.390 --> 01:17:16.187
LUMUMBA AKINWOLE-BANDELE:
Let me say--

01:17:16.187 --> 01:17:17.770
it's important for
a number of reasons

01:17:17.770 --> 01:17:25.100
to really push back on this
idea of policing our appearance.

01:17:25.100 --> 01:17:26.550
Number one, I think
it contributes

01:17:26.550 --> 01:17:28.830
to the whole commercialization
of a culture,

01:17:28.830 --> 01:17:31.110
of hip hop culture, number one.

01:17:31.110 --> 01:17:32.120
And let's be real, also.

01:17:32.120 --> 01:17:33.660
You probably around my age.

01:17:33.660 --> 01:17:36.780
But we've always had a
moment in our development

01:17:36.780 --> 01:17:41.530
where we've done some
really crazy fashion stuff.

01:17:41.530 --> 01:17:45.340
Ya'll remember when you used
to wear your pants backwards?

01:17:45.340 --> 01:17:47.930
You had the sneakers
with no laces.

01:17:47.930 --> 01:17:48.764
RON DAVIS: Sure did.

01:17:48.764 --> 01:17:50.513
LUMUMBA AKINWOLE-BANDELE:
Every generation

01:17:50.513 --> 01:17:52.171
is going to have something.

01:17:52.171 --> 01:17:54.170
And they are going to
grow out of it, hopefully.

01:17:54.170 --> 01:17:56.510
The guys that's 45 years
old, they pants brought down,

01:17:56.510 --> 01:17:57.700
they got a problem.

01:17:57.700 --> 01:18:05.270
But no one's pants height
has ever saved their life.

01:18:05.270 --> 01:18:06.330
It hasn't.

01:18:06.330 --> 01:18:09.780
We have to be able
to really push back

01:18:09.780 --> 01:18:15.080
on this whole idea of having to
fix ourselves up, and position

01:18:15.080 --> 01:18:17.150
ourselves, and perform
in a certain way

01:18:17.150 --> 01:18:19.440
in order to just
stay alive, in order

01:18:19.440 --> 01:18:24.830
to be safe because we
are switching the focus.

01:18:24.830 --> 01:18:28.380
We need to deal with the
systems that are criminalizing

01:18:28.380 --> 01:18:31.050
our bodies, that are
criminalizing our cultures,

01:18:31.050 --> 01:18:33.660
that make that unsafe.

01:18:33.660 --> 01:18:36.160
RON DAVIS: And, also, I just
want to say that, first of all,

01:18:36.160 --> 01:18:39.770
I'm going to acknowledge Jasiri
X is here, a spoken word poet.

01:18:39.770 --> 01:18:40.800
Stand up, Jasiri.

01:18:40.800 --> 01:18:43.990
He puts himself on
the line all the time.

01:18:43.990 --> 01:18:46.656
He wears his X cap.

01:18:46.656 --> 01:18:48.405
He walk out the door
right now, the police

01:18:48.405 --> 01:18:50.580
are going to look at him.

01:18:50.580 --> 01:18:52.740
But this young
brother, he's powerful.

01:18:52.740 --> 01:18:55.440
I've heard him speak, and
he's always at the Left Forum

01:18:55.440 --> 01:18:56.690
here in New York.

01:18:56.690 --> 01:18:57.630
So come check him out.

01:18:57.630 --> 01:18:59.490
During Memorial Day holiday,
he's always at the Left Forum.

01:18:59.490 --> 01:19:00.662
LINDA SARSOUR:
Everybody [INAUDIBLE].

01:19:00.662 --> 01:19:01.828
RON DAVIS: I know everybody.

01:19:01.828 --> 01:19:03.055
I know everybody.

01:19:03.055 --> 01:19:05.550
I give props to folks
that's working hard

01:19:05.550 --> 01:19:07.730
against the system
in the movement.

01:19:07.730 --> 01:19:09.530
And they say Black Lives Matter.

01:19:09.530 --> 01:19:13.070
Black Lives Matter is a
human rights movement.

01:19:13.070 --> 01:19:14.480
It's not a civil
rights movement.

01:19:14.480 --> 01:19:16.280
It's a humans right.

01:19:16.280 --> 01:19:16.780
OK.

01:19:16.780 --> 01:19:18.990
So let's go back to your
question, young man.

01:19:18.990 --> 01:19:20.630
My thing is it
takes me back, when

01:19:20.630 --> 01:19:23.070
you said that, to the '60s.

01:19:23.070 --> 01:19:24.860
There was one point
in the '60s when

01:19:24.860 --> 01:19:26.850
Huey P. Newton and all
the boys out in Oakland

01:19:26.850 --> 01:19:29.880
were doing their thing.

01:19:29.880 --> 01:19:32.115
And the brothers
got into solidarity,

01:19:32.115 --> 01:19:33.880
and the brothers started
wearing dashikis.

01:19:33.880 --> 01:19:34.630
You remember that?

01:19:34.630 --> 01:19:35.570
Dashikis?

01:19:35.570 --> 01:19:36.352
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

01:19:36.352 --> 01:19:38.060
RON DAVIS: What happened
to the dashikis?

01:19:38.060 --> 01:19:39.960
What happened to the
Angela Davis haircuts?

01:19:39.960 --> 01:19:42.670
What happened to all that stuff?

01:19:42.670 --> 01:19:47.200
What happened was we exerted
ourselves, our independence.

01:19:47.200 --> 01:19:51.520
But we were seen as militant
because we had a dashiki on.

01:19:51.520 --> 01:19:54.900
If a woman had the
big Angela Davis Afro,

01:19:54.900 --> 01:19:56.540
she was seen as militant.

01:19:56.540 --> 01:20:00.250
So, with your degree, your
PhD, your master's degree, you

01:20:00.250 --> 01:20:02.240
knock on corporate
America, they say

01:20:02.240 --> 01:20:04.210
we don't have a job for you.

01:20:04.210 --> 01:20:06.150
So they dumbed us down.

01:20:06.150 --> 01:20:08.070
We became dressing
like they want

01:20:08.070 --> 01:20:10.550
us to dress to get their job.

01:20:10.550 --> 01:20:12.765
You don't see brothers
in Google with dashikis.

01:20:12.765 --> 01:20:16.690
You don't see brothers in these
corporations for Coca Cola

01:20:16.690 --> 01:20:18.050
and all that with dashikis.

01:20:18.050 --> 01:20:19.290
You know why?

01:20:19.290 --> 01:20:21.710
Because they want their job.

01:20:21.710 --> 01:20:26.700
We have to get to a point
where what we dress like

01:20:26.700 --> 01:20:32.000
pales against the knowledge
that we have, that they need us.

01:20:32.000 --> 01:20:34.650
Whoopi Goldberg wears
her braids proudly,

01:20:34.650 --> 01:20:36.960
but they need her on the show.

01:20:36.960 --> 01:20:37.640
You understand?

01:20:37.640 --> 01:20:40.660
She doesn't dumb it
down for anybody.

01:20:40.660 --> 01:20:43.590
So we need more
people like that.

01:20:43.590 --> 01:20:46.280
So if we get more people
like that, how we dress

01:20:46.280 --> 01:20:48.840
won't matter because
we're still intelligent.

01:20:48.840 --> 01:20:51.670
It has nothing to do
with our intellect.

01:20:51.670 --> 01:20:54.380
So I say if the young men
want to wear their pants down,

01:20:54.380 --> 01:20:54.970
that's fine.

01:20:54.970 --> 01:20:57.390
But let them know that
they have to work twice as

01:20:57.390 --> 01:21:00.840
hard to get that job because
that's corporate America.

01:21:00.840 --> 01:21:03.590
That's the same America that
has the Constitution that

01:21:03.590 --> 01:21:07.700
still, to this day, says that
we're 3/5 of a human being.

01:21:07.700 --> 01:21:11.040
Remember what you're
working with right here.

01:21:11.040 --> 01:21:14.877
So we still like Dred Scott.

01:21:14.877 --> 01:21:16.960
We're not a citizen until
we become a human being.

01:21:16.960 --> 01:21:18.770
So understand that.

01:21:18.770 --> 01:21:22.460
So I say to you, brothers,
tell your class that, yeah.

01:21:22.460 --> 01:21:23.420
You can be individual.

01:21:23.420 --> 01:21:24.711
You can dress the way you like.

01:21:24.711 --> 01:21:26.580
But keep getting that education.

01:21:26.580 --> 01:21:29.530
Keep getting that education
because, like Albert Einstein

01:21:29.530 --> 01:21:33.140
said, "there is always going
to be racism in America

01:21:33.140 --> 01:21:35.450
until they become
educated and enlightened."

01:21:35.450 --> 01:21:37.530
So you have to
continue to do that.

01:21:37.530 --> 01:21:38.694
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

01:21:38.694 --> 01:21:40.110
TORRENCE BOONE:
Our last question.

01:21:40.110 --> 01:21:43.200
AUDIENCE: First and foremost,
thank you for your presence.

01:21:43.200 --> 01:21:45.000
Thank you for being here.

01:21:45.000 --> 01:21:47.507
In the film, there
was a brief moment

01:21:47.507 --> 01:21:49.090
where you mentioned
when you, I guess,

01:21:49.090 --> 01:21:52.170
initially made contact
with Trayvon's parents.

01:21:52.170 --> 01:21:55.600
And his father had said,
"welcome to the club

01:21:55.600 --> 01:21:58.760
that no one wants to be a
part of, but you're a member."

01:21:58.760 --> 01:22:04.260
Can you speak a little bit as
parents to that membership,

01:22:04.260 --> 01:22:10.730
and what it has meant
for you, and in what ways

01:22:10.730 --> 01:22:15.560
it may kind of bring
you maybe closer

01:22:15.560 --> 01:22:22.063
to a space of healing
or just about the club?

01:22:22.063 --> 01:22:27.820
RON DAVIS: That club
is-- that club, right?

01:22:27.820 --> 01:22:33.120
[LAUGHS] Tracy Martin really,
for me, was one of the first

01:22:33.120 --> 01:22:39.500
to step out there as a
father because you always

01:22:39.500 --> 01:22:48.050
saw the mothers on CNN,
MSNBC, all the usual suspects

01:22:48.050 --> 01:22:49.960
because the mothers
have the emotion.

01:22:49.960 --> 01:22:51.404
They birthed the child.

01:22:51.404 --> 01:22:52.820
And they want to
see that emotion.

01:22:52.820 --> 01:22:54.870
And they bring the
circle of mothers up,

01:22:54.870 --> 01:22:57.640
and you see that
time and time again.

01:22:57.640 --> 01:22:58.569
And I sit back.

01:22:58.569 --> 01:22:59.860
And I tell Lucy that sometimes.

01:22:59.860 --> 01:23:03.970
I say I feel
marginalized as a father.

01:23:03.970 --> 01:23:07.750
Fathers, sometimes we cry
in the dark, right guys?

01:23:07.750 --> 01:23:10.300
Sometimes when things hurt
us, we don't particularly

01:23:10.300 --> 01:23:15.150
show it when the lights are
bright because you're born,

01:23:15.150 --> 01:23:18.020
and your parents bring you up
to be the leader of your family,

01:23:18.020 --> 01:23:21.530
to protect your loved
ones, protect your wife,

01:23:21.530 --> 01:23:23.420
protect your children.

01:23:23.420 --> 01:23:25.490
So you have to be strong.

01:23:25.490 --> 01:23:27.910
But we hurt, and we cry.

01:23:27.910 --> 01:23:32.170
And so Tracy brought
Sean Bell's father down,

01:23:32.170 --> 01:23:36.240
the young man that was killed
at the bachelorette party

01:23:36.240 --> 01:23:38.000
here in New York.

01:23:38.000 --> 01:23:41.840
William Bell came
down, his father.

01:23:41.840 --> 01:23:47.300
Tracy brought a few
other fathers down there.

01:23:47.300 --> 01:23:51.295
And we had about 12 fathers,
Oscar Grant's Uncle Bobby

01:23:51.295 --> 01:23:55.850
from Oakland, California,
and got us together

01:23:55.850 --> 01:23:58.191
and said the media is
going to marginalize you

01:23:58.191 --> 01:24:00.315
just because they don't
think much of black fathers

01:24:00.315 --> 01:24:02.140
to begin with.

01:24:02.140 --> 01:24:05.420
They portray us as
either in prison,

01:24:05.420 --> 01:24:10.610
or in control of the state
prisons, or drug addicts,

01:24:10.610 --> 01:24:14.470
or we have 12 babies
across the country,

01:24:14.470 --> 01:24:16.580
and we don't pay child support.

01:24:16.580 --> 01:24:19.170
That's our MO.

01:24:19.170 --> 01:24:22.230
And so, when they come
across fathers life

01:24:22.230 --> 01:24:26.550
Trayvon's father,
fathers that stand up

01:24:26.550 --> 01:24:30.320
like Uncle Bobby, fathers
all over this country that

01:24:30.320 --> 01:24:34.690
feel just as terribly, if
not more than the mothers do,

01:24:34.690 --> 01:24:37.490
they don't get the
platform from the media

01:24:37.490 --> 01:24:40.490
to show and to speak about it.

01:24:40.490 --> 01:24:41.940
And so, time and
time again, when

01:24:41.940 --> 01:24:44.400
you go into these meetings
with these fathers, we say,

01:24:44.400 --> 01:24:46.400
you know what?

01:24:46.400 --> 01:24:48.420
Each time that you get
in front of a microphone,

01:24:48.420 --> 01:24:51.230
let them know how the men
feel about what's going on.

01:24:51.230 --> 01:24:53.080
You don't understand
the hurt that we have

01:24:53.080 --> 01:24:57.180
when I sit on my couch when I
used to look at football games

01:24:57.180 --> 01:24:58.350
with Jordan.

01:24:58.350 --> 01:25:01.660
And I look at the football
games of the New York Giants,

01:25:01.660 --> 01:25:02.910
and he's not there.

01:25:02.910 --> 01:25:06.880
When they score a touchdown,
when Odell scores a touchdown,

01:25:06.880 --> 01:25:10.220
I look over at the couch,
and Jordan's not there.

01:25:10.220 --> 01:25:15.174
So much so that when I
had my Giant's jacket on,

01:25:15.174 --> 01:25:16.840
after Jordan was
killed, the next week I

01:25:16.840 --> 01:25:23.360
got a letter and a book from
the coach of the Giants.

01:25:23.360 --> 01:25:28.250
And I could not believe this
letter, a handwritten letter,

01:25:28.250 --> 01:25:31.260
from the coach of the Giants.

01:25:31.260 --> 01:25:34.812
And so people are looking
at what you do on television

01:25:34.812 --> 01:25:36.520
because he looked and
saw some interviews

01:25:36.520 --> 01:25:42.010
and say "I'm very sorry that
you lost your son, Mr. Davis.

01:25:42.010 --> 01:25:44.080
And I'm glad that
you're just not spewing

01:25:44.080 --> 01:25:48.240
hate all across this country and
that you're not causing people

01:25:48.240 --> 01:25:49.910
to riot in
Jacksonville" because he

01:25:49.910 --> 01:25:53.140
used to be the coach of
the Jacksonville Jaguars.

01:25:53.140 --> 01:25:56.730
And so Tom Coughlin didn't
want that to happen.

01:25:56.730 --> 01:25:58.840
And so people are watching you.

01:25:58.840 --> 01:26:01.510
Me and Lucy were invited
by President Obama

01:26:01.510 --> 01:26:04.510
to My Brother's Keeper
initiative at the White House.

01:26:04.510 --> 01:26:07.412
They screened, actually,
this film at the White House.

01:26:07.412 --> 01:26:08.370
So people are watching.

01:26:08.370 --> 01:26:12.820
And I just think that-- I
know the network of females

01:26:12.820 --> 01:26:13.970
is strong.

01:26:13.970 --> 01:26:17.490
Black Lives Matter is led
by females, Alicia Garza,

01:26:17.490 --> 01:26:20.350
and Opal, and Carmen.

01:26:20.350 --> 01:26:21.870
I know that.

01:26:21.870 --> 01:26:24.480
And I can name probably
12 organizations

01:26:24.480 --> 01:26:26.475
that are led by females.

01:26:26.475 --> 01:26:30.910
I could only maybe name two
that are led, on the streets,

01:26:30.910 --> 01:26:33.030
grassroot by males.

01:26:33.030 --> 01:26:35.700
And so if we're
not going to lead,

01:26:35.700 --> 01:26:38.790
then we must support our queens.

01:26:38.790 --> 01:26:40.899
Every man in this room
should support their queen

01:26:40.899 --> 01:26:41.690
if they're leading.

01:26:41.690 --> 01:26:44.740
I support Lucy in what
she's doing with Everytown.

01:26:44.740 --> 01:26:48.180
And so do not let
us be separated

01:26:48.180 --> 01:26:52.820
by gender, whether
you're queer, LGBT,

01:26:52.820 --> 01:26:54.990
do not let us be separated.

01:26:54.990 --> 01:26:57.010
Do not let us be
separated when we

01:26:57.010 --> 01:27:00.280
think that they're talking about
the Muslims, so we don't care.

01:27:00.280 --> 01:27:01.800
If they do that to
the Muslim, they

01:27:01.800 --> 01:27:05.021
do that to the black people.

01:27:05.021 --> 01:27:06.520
If they do that to
the queer people,

01:27:06.520 --> 01:27:08.130
they do that to
the black people.

01:27:08.130 --> 01:27:10.920
If they do that to the Mexicans
and the Latinas and Latinas,

01:27:10.920 --> 01:27:12.840
they do it to the black people.

01:27:12.840 --> 01:27:15.080
So you cannot let
them separate gender,

01:27:15.080 --> 01:27:17.440
separate sexual orientation.

01:27:17.440 --> 01:27:20.340
You can't let them
separate nationalities.

01:27:20.340 --> 01:27:22.650
When it's wrong, and
it's discrimination,

01:27:22.650 --> 01:27:25.380
you must find it
any and everywhere.

01:27:25.380 --> 01:27:29.870
LUCY MCBATH: And let me speak
from the mother's perspective,

01:27:29.870 --> 01:27:32.180
definitely speaking from
the mother's perspective.

01:27:32.180 --> 01:27:36.830
Yes, a mother's heart is what
the country usually hears.

01:27:36.830 --> 01:27:38.920
But, even in that,
there's stigmatism

01:27:38.920 --> 01:27:41.500
with the black mothers.

01:27:41.500 --> 01:27:46.290
We are vilified because
the country in the world

01:27:46.290 --> 01:27:49.900
says that you didn't
raise them properly.

01:27:49.900 --> 01:27:52.660
That's the reason why
they were gunned down

01:27:52.660 --> 01:27:54.890
because they were
in the wrong place

01:27:54.890 --> 01:27:56.930
at the wrong time
doing something wrong.

01:27:56.930 --> 01:28:01.970
It's automatically assumed
that they are in the wrong

01:28:01.970 --> 01:28:05.120
and that we are
not good mothers.

01:28:05.120 --> 01:28:07.520
We didn't raise them right.

01:28:07.520 --> 01:28:09.150
They didn't do the right thing.

01:28:09.150 --> 01:28:10.490
I didn't do the right thing.

01:28:10.490 --> 01:28:12.960
That's the reason why
they were gunned down.

01:28:12.960 --> 01:28:16.250
And, as a message to
your whole community,

01:28:16.250 --> 01:28:18.050
this is what will
continue to happen

01:28:18.050 --> 01:28:21.810
if you don't raise your voice
and raise your children right.

01:28:21.810 --> 01:28:24.310
So there's a stigma
on the mother.

01:28:24.310 --> 01:28:26.580
Even though you hear
the voice, we're

01:28:26.580 --> 01:28:31.030
still looked upon as
you didn't do it right,

01:28:31.030 --> 01:28:36.150
and you have no man
in the household.

01:28:36.150 --> 01:28:38.940
That's why you
didn't get it right.

01:28:38.940 --> 01:28:43.100
And where are the fathers,
as if to say that a mother,

01:28:43.100 --> 01:28:48.200
a strong black minority mother
cannot raise a strong black

01:28:48.200 --> 01:28:49.510
man.

01:28:49.510 --> 01:28:52.950
And that is a terrible misnomer.

01:28:52.950 --> 01:28:56.240
Most of the households in
this country that do not

01:28:56.240 --> 01:29:03.430
have fathers have very
strong, proud, educated, Godly

01:29:03.430 --> 01:29:08.240
black women that are
raising strong, educated,

01:29:08.240 --> 01:29:09.750
Godly black men.

01:29:09.750 --> 01:29:12.250
[APPLAUSE]

01:29:12.250 --> 01:29:18.010
So I was sitting in a
meeting with Hillary Clinton.

01:29:18.010 --> 01:29:20.140
And, yes, all the
mothers, we were there.

01:29:20.140 --> 01:29:24.050
We were summoned to speak
with her-- Michael Brown's

01:29:24.050 --> 01:29:31.240
mother, Trayvon Martin's mother,
Eric Garner's mother, I was

01:29:31.240 --> 01:29:34.280
there, and Hidaya
Pendleton's mother, I mean,

01:29:34.280 --> 01:29:38.480
all of the mothers of the
high profile shootings.

01:29:38.480 --> 01:29:45.180
And it was so painful
to me as I turned

01:29:45.180 --> 01:29:47.710
and I looked at Cleo
Pendleton, and I

01:29:47.710 --> 01:29:52.340
said I can't believe
we have to sit here.

01:29:52.340 --> 01:29:56.500
I can't believe why we are here.

01:29:56.500 --> 01:30:00.240
Even though, yes, she
wants to hear from us.

01:30:00.240 --> 01:30:02.070
And, yes, she wants
to hear our story.

01:30:02.070 --> 01:30:05.530
She already has our
profiles and our bios.

01:30:05.530 --> 01:30:08.290
She already knows the stories.

01:30:08.290 --> 01:30:11.040
But the fact that we had
to sit there to convince

01:30:11.040 --> 01:30:18.680
her to take some responsibility
if she's placed in office

01:30:18.680 --> 01:30:21.135
to care about what's
happening to our children.

01:30:23.780 --> 01:30:28.730
And it has to be the mothers
to do that because we're

01:30:28.730 --> 01:30:31.990
raising these children,
these babies, that are being

01:30:31.990 --> 01:30:34.970
gunned down in the street.

01:30:34.970 --> 01:30:40.010
So if it is not the
voice of the mother,

01:30:40.010 --> 01:30:42.910
then it's not going to happen.

01:30:42.910 --> 01:30:45.910
Any cultural change or
shift in this country

01:30:45.910 --> 01:30:47.380
has been led by a woman.

01:30:50.280 --> 01:30:54.500
And this one, too,
will be led by a woman.

01:30:54.500 --> 01:30:58.160
Yes, the men are just as
integral and important.

01:30:58.160 --> 01:31:02.060
But it will be led by a woman
because of the mother's heart.

01:31:02.060 --> 01:31:04.160
Our babies-- we have
birthed the babies

01:31:04.160 --> 01:31:08.152
that are dying in the streets.

01:31:08.152 --> 01:31:11.146
[APPLAUSE]

01:31:15.140 --> 01:31:18.430
TORRENCE BOONE: I think want
to wrap by just bringing back

01:31:18.430 --> 01:31:20.690
the call to action
that Ron mentioned,

01:31:20.690 --> 01:31:23.890
which is go get change.

01:31:23.890 --> 01:31:26.150
I think that's our call
to action for the evening.

01:31:26.150 --> 01:31:29.670
And please join me in thanking
the panelists for their time.

01:31:29.670 --> 01:31:33.037
[APPLAUSE]

01:31:42.680 --> 01:31:45.630
And I would just like
to invite Chelsea

01:31:45.630 --> 01:31:48.220
back up to give some
closing remarks,

01:31:48.220 --> 01:31:49.340
and then we'll let you go.

01:31:49.340 --> 01:31:51.464
RON DAVIS: And I have some
wristbands for you also.

01:31:51.464 --> 01:31:52.924
[LAUGHING]

01:31:52.959 --> 01:31:54.000
CHELSEA SEABRON: Awesome.

01:31:54.000 --> 01:31:56.300
So I also would love to
give a round of applause

01:31:56.300 --> 01:31:58.452
to Torrence Boone
for moderating today.

01:31:58.452 --> 01:32:00.912
[APPLAUSE]

01:32:04.860 --> 01:32:08.090
And it's a great example of
how our Google leadership also

01:32:08.090 --> 01:32:11.340
has chosen to use your
place of privilege

01:32:11.340 --> 01:32:13.980
and your place of influence
to show up for this dialogue.

01:32:13.980 --> 01:32:15.700
So thank you.

01:32:15.700 --> 01:32:18.100
I know it's late, but
I wanted to quickly let

01:32:18.100 --> 01:32:20.410
everybody know a
couple next steps just

01:32:20.410 --> 01:32:23.580
so you know how to expect
to hear from us after this.

01:32:23.580 --> 01:32:27.310
So, after tonight's event,
we'll email everybody tomorrow

01:32:27.310 --> 01:32:30.340
with a survey with some
challenging questions

01:32:30.340 --> 01:32:32.980
to really let the
content of tonight

01:32:32.980 --> 01:32:37.210
sink in and give you tools and
thoughts for how to make this

01:32:37.210 --> 01:32:38.990
a real in your own life.

01:32:38.990 --> 01:32:40.920
I also encourage you
guys to wear the t-shirts

01:32:40.920 --> 01:32:42.390
that we provided.

01:32:42.390 --> 01:32:46.180
From other screenings, it's
such a good dialogue spur.

01:32:46.180 --> 01:32:50.030
So wear those t-shirts and share
what you experienced tonight.

01:32:50.030 --> 01:32:52.490
And last, but
certainly not least,

01:32:52.490 --> 01:32:54.560
you have bios for
every single panelist.

01:32:54.560 --> 01:32:57.610
And so we would love for you
to plug into each cause that's

01:32:57.610 --> 01:32:59.760
represented on stage.

01:32:59.760 --> 01:33:02.129
And I think we'll all be
around for a little bit,

01:33:02.129 --> 01:33:04.420
so feel free to stick around
for a couple of questions.

01:33:04.420 --> 01:33:06.300
But thank you all for
showing up and getting

01:33:06.300 --> 01:33:08.340
uncomfortable with
us this evening.

01:33:08.340 --> 01:33:12.160
And we look forward to now all
being in this journey together.

01:33:12.160 --> 01:33:14.040
So, however you
walk away tonight,

01:33:14.040 --> 01:33:16.810
just feel empowered
to do your part.

01:33:16.810 --> 01:33:17.420
So thank you.

01:33:17.420 --> 01:33:21.370
[APPLAUSE]
