(women laughing)

00:00:12.211 --> 00:00:13.980 align:start position:0%
(woman)
You guys.
You never slept with him.

00:00:14.013 --> 00:00:15.515 align:start position:0%
You don't know
what you're missing.

00:00:15.548 --> 00:00:16.516
(woman 2)
No way!

00:00:16.549 --> 00:00:17.650 align:start position:0%
It's crazy.

00:00:17.683 --> 00:00:18.651 align:start size:25% position:75%
Hi.

00:00:18.684 --> 00:00:20.086 align:start size:41% position:59%
Are you lost?

00:00:20.119 --> 00:00:22.355
Um, I'm sorry.

00:00:22.388 --> 00:00:25.158
I just-- I love
all of you, I can't--

00:00:25.191 --> 00:00:26.826 align:start size:47% position:53%
(laughing)
I can't believe
you're here.

00:00:26.859 --> 00:00:28.528 align:start size:63% position:38%
You're, like,
literally my heroes.

00:00:28.561 --> 00:00:29.996 align:start position:0%
(Julia)
God, you look familiar.

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:32.465 align:start position:0%
Are you that girl
from the television

00:00:32.498 --> 00:00:34.500 align:start position:0%
who talks about her
pussy all the time?

00:00:34.533 --> 00:00:36.235 align:start size:41% position:59%
Yes!

00:00:36.268 --> 00:00:38.304 align:start size:69% position:31%
That-- Yes, thank you.

00:00:38.337 --> 00:00:40.206 line:83%
How fun.
Well, come sit.

00:00:38.337 --> 00:00:40.206 align:start position:0%
Please.

00:00:40.239 --> 00:00:41.541 line:83%
(laughing)
Come on.

00:00:40.239 --> 00:00:41.541 align:start size:38% position:63%
Yeah.

00:00:41.574 --> 00:00:43.009 align:start position:0%
Come talk about
your pussy over here.

00:00:43.042 --> 00:00:45.278
(Amy giggling)

00:00:45.311 --> 00:00:47.513 align:start size:84% position:16%
Is it-- Is it
someone's birthday or--

00:00:47.546 --> 00:00:48.514 align:start size:9% position:91%
Oh.

00:00:48.547 --> 00:00:49.749 align:start position:0%
Kind of the opposite.

00:00:49.782 --> 00:00:51.684 align:start position:0%
We're celebrating Julia's
last fuckable day.

00:00:51.717 --> 00:00:53.019
(Julia)
Yes, salud.

00:00:53.052 --> 00:00:55.655
Woo!
Woohoo!

00:00:55.688 --> 00:00:57.857 align:start size:81% position:19%
Um, I'm sorry, did you say
Julia's last fuckable day?

00:00:57.890 --> 00:00:59.125 align:start position:0% line:85%
Mm-hmm.

00:00:57.890 --> 00:00:59.125 align:start size:22% position:78%
Mm-hmm.

00:00:59.158 --> 00:01:00.726 align:start size:41% position:59%
What is that?

00:01:00.759 --> 00:01:02.261
In every actress' life,

00:01:02.294 --> 00:01:04.163 align:start size:53% position:47%
the media decides
when you finally

00:01:04.196 --> 00:01:07.366 align:start position:0%
reach the point where you're not
believably fuckable anymore.

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:10.136 align:start size:50% position:50%
But-- I mean,
how do you know?

00:01:10.169 --> 00:01:11.270 align:start size:44% position:56%
Who tells you?

00:01:11.303 --> 00:01:13.906 align:start position:0%
Well, nobody--
Nobody really overtly tells you,

00:01:13.939 --> 00:01:14.907 align:start size:31% position:69% line:85%
Right.

00:01:13.939 --> 00:01:14.907 align:start position:0%
but there are signs.

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:16.709 align:start position:0%
You, like--
You know how Sally Field

00:01:16.742 --> 00:01:17.910 align:end size:47% position:47%
was Tom Hanks'
love interest

00:01:17.943 --> 00:01:20.012 size:75% position:38%
in "Punchline" and then,
like, 20 minutes later,

00:01:20.045 --> 00:01:21.380 align:start position:0%
she was his mom
in "Forest Gump"?

00:01:21.413 --> 00:01:23.483
Or you might get
offered a romcom

00:01:23.516 --> 00:01:25.218
with Jack Nicholson
where you're competing

00:01:25.251 --> 00:01:27.753
with another woman
to fuck him.

00:01:27.786 --> 00:01:30.089 align:start position:0% line:83%
I just had an audition
for Mrs. Claus.

00:01:27.786 --> 00:01:30.089 align:start size:56% position:44%
You're kidding me.

00:01:30.122 --> 00:01:31.257 align:start size:66% position:34% line:85%
I read for that part.

00:01:30.122 --> 00:01:31.257 align:start position:0%
You did?

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:32.892 align:start position:0% line:78%
I read for that, too.

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:32.892
(Julia)
You did?

00:01:32.925 --> 00:01:34.327 align:start position:0% line:85%
Yes.

00:01:32.925 --> 00:01:34.327
Hey, who got that?

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:36.762 align:start position:0% line:78%
J.Lo.

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:36.762 align:start size:59% position:41%
(gasping)
Oh, she'll be good.

00:01:36.795 --> 00:01:38.264 size:84% position:42% line:78%
She's gonna be really good.

00:01:36.795 --> 00:01:38.264
(Julia)
Really good.

00:01:38.297 --> 00:01:39.665 align:start size:78% position:22%
Or you go to a movie set,

00:01:39.698 --> 00:01:41.300 align:start size:56% position:44%
you go to wardrobe
and the only thing

00:01:41.333 --> 00:01:42.935 align:start size:78% position:22%
they have for you to wear
are long sweaters,

00:01:42.968 --> 00:01:45.138 align:start size:81% position:19%
like cover you up
head to toe kind of thing.

00:01:45.171 --> 00:01:46.639 align:start position:0%
Right, or, like,
the poster for your movie

00:01:46.672 --> 00:01:48.374 align:start position:0%
is just, like, a picture
of a kitchen.

00:01:48.407 --> 00:01:52.178 align:start position:0% line:78%
Yeah.

00:01:48.407 --> 00:01:52.178 size:84% position:58%
With these very uplifting
and yet vague titles, like,

00:01:52.211 --> 00:01:55.248 align:end position:100%
"Whatever It Takes"
or "She Means Well."

00:01:55.281 --> 00:01:56.716 align:start position:0%
That kind
of thing, right?

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:59.318
Another common sign is when they
start remaking your best movies

00:01:59.351 --> 00:02:01.220 align:start size:75% position:25%
with younger,
more fuckable actresses.

00:02:01.253 --> 00:02:04.423 align:start position:0%
I guess they're making "Boyhood"
with Selena Gomez in my part.

00:02:04.456 --> 00:02:05.691 align:start position:0%
That's gonna make
a lot of money.

00:02:05.724 --> 00:02:08.261 align:start size:72% position:28%
I don't understand.
You're all so fuckable.

00:02:08.294 --> 00:02:10.830
Like, believe me, no one
was more surprised than me

00:02:10.863 --> 00:02:13.166
that they let me stay fuckable
throughout my 40s

00:02:13.199 --> 00:02:15.535
and the fact that it
continued into my 50s.

00:02:15.568 --> 00:02:17.537
This was just like,
thanks, but...

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:19.105
I thought that US Weekly
had made some sort of

00:02:19.138 --> 00:02:21.007
a clerical error
or something.

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:22.942 align:start position:0%
Tell me about it.
If you shoot a sex scene

00:02:22.975 --> 00:02:24.177 align:start position:0%
the night before
your birthday,

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:25.611 align:start position:0%
everyone is like,
hurry up, hurry up,

00:02:25.644 --> 00:02:26.612 align:end size:53% position:53%
we gotta get it
before midnight,

00:02:26.645 --> 00:02:27.780 align:start position:0%
'cause they think
your vagina

00:02:27.813 --> 00:02:29.448 align:start position:0% line:83%
is gonna turn
into a hermit crab.

00:02:27.813 --> 00:02:29.448 align:start size:22% position:78%
Uh-huh.

00:02:29.481 --> 00:02:31.584 align:start position:0%
Well, is there anything
you can do to delay it?

00:02:31.617 --> 00:02:34.053 size:84% position:58%
Yeah, I mean, you can try,
but it only makes it worse,

00:02:34.086 --> 00:02:35.188 align:start size:50% position:50%
like those
Real Housewives.

00:02:35.221 --> 00:02:36.389 align:start position:0%
They try to look young,

00:02:36.422 --> 00:02:38.291 align:start position:0%
but then they end up
looking like a purse

00:02:38.324 --> 00:02:40.459 align:start size:56% position:44% line:83%
that melted
in a car accident.

00:02:38.324 --> 00:02:40.459 align:start size:91% position:9%
Yeah.

00:02:40.492 --> 00:02:43.629 size:78% position:39%
They look like when a kid
draws a face on its hand.

00:02:43.662 --> 00:02:45.765 align:start size:59% position:41%
But what about men?
Like, who tells men

00:02:45.798 --> 00:02:47.466 align:start size:56% position:44%
when it's their
last fuckable day?

00:02:47.499 --> 00:02:50.970
(all laughing)

00:02:51.003 --> 00:02:53.606 align:start position:0% line:83%
Honey, men don't
have that day.

00:02:51.003 --> 00:02:53.606 align:start size:25% position:75%
Never.

00:02:53.639 --> 00:02:54.874 align:start position:0%
Well, they're
fuckable forever.

00:02:54.907 --> 00:02:57.109 align:start position:0%
They could be 100 and, like,
nothing but white spiders

00:02:57.142 --> 00:02:58.811 align:start position:0%
coming out,
but they're fuckable.

00:02:58.844 --> 00:03:00.846
I didn't get this commercial
last week for AARP

00:03:00.879 --> 00:03:02.715
because the director
said I was too old

00:03:02.748 --> 00:03:04.116
to play Larry King's wife.

00:03:04.149 --> 00:03:05.918 size:78% position:39%
I heard that Bruce Willis

00:03:05.951 --> 00:03:09.188 align:start position:0%
just got engaged to a girl
who is 24 years younger than him

00:03:09.221 --> 00:03:11.991 align:start position:0%
and I heard that
she's an actual baby lamb.

00:03:12.024 --> 00:03:13.726 align:start size:47% position:53%
What?
Really?

00:03:13.759 --> 00:03:15.261 align:start position:0%
Mm, Google it.

00:03:15.294 --> 00:03:16.996 align:start position:0%
So, wait, are you guys,
like, bummed at all?

00:03:17.029 --> 00:03:18.397
(Julia)
What?
No.

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:19.398
Are you kidding me?

00:03:19.431 --> 00:03:20.700
I'm thrilled.

00:03:20.733 --> 00:03:21.901
Ecstatic.

00:03:21.934 --> 00:03:23.769
I mean, I don't have
to deal with this,

00:03:23.802 --> 00:03:24.870
maintaining this anymore.

00:03:24.903 --> 00:03:27.273
I mean, it's just such--
It's a godsend.

00:03:27.306 --> 00:03:29.008 align:start size:63% position:38%
I can grow
my pubes out, it's--

00:03:29.041 --> 00:03:30.109 align:start size:41% position:59%
Look at this.

00:03:30.142 --> 00:03:31.310 align:start size:59% position:41%
See this ice cream?

00:03:31.343 --> 00:03:32.678 align:start size:66% position:34%
It's been sitting
out here for an hour.

00:03:32.711 --> 00:03:34.313 align:start size:59% position:41%
You wanna know why?

00:03:34.346 --> 00:03:35.782 align:start size:53% position:47%
Watch this, baby.

00:03:36.882 --> 00:03:38.751
(all chanting)
Chug, chug, chug, chug!

00:03:38.784 --> 00:03:39.919
Chug, chug, chug, chug!

00:03:39.952 --> 00:03:42.288 align:start position:0%
(Amy chuckling)
Oh, my God!
Woo!

00:03:42.321 --> 00:03:43.689 align:start size:38% position:63%
(belching)

00:03:43.722 --> 00:03:46.025 align:start position:0%
Whoa! (laughing)

00:03:46.058 --> 00:03:47.026 align:start size:28% position:72%
(farting)

00:03:47.059 --> 00:03:49.028 align:start position:0% line:78%
Oh, whoa.

00:03:47.059 --> 00:03:49.028
(Tina)
Hilo !

00:03:49.061 --> 00:03:50.029
(all laughing)

00:03:50.062 --> 00:03:51.030
(Julia)
All right.

00:03:51.063 --> 00:03:52.098 align:start size:38% position:63%
You know
what's next.

00:03:52.131 --> 00:03:53.099 align:start size:34% position:66%
Let's go do
this thing.

00:03:53.132 --> 00:03:54.100 align:start size:59% position:41%
Where are we going?

00:03:54.133 --> 00:03:55.401 align:start position:0%
To do the ritual.

00:03:57.369 --> 00:03:58.504 align:start size:47% position:53%
And then we put
her in the boat

00:03:58.537 --> 00:04:00.239 align:start size:59% position:41%
and we push her out
into the water

00:04:00.272 --> 00:04:02.341 align:start size:69% position:31%
and we drink champagne
to salute how fuckable

00:04:02.374 --> 00:04:03.743 align:start size:56% position:44%
she was
for so many years.

00:04:03.776 --> 00:04:04.677 align:start size:31% position:69%
It's nice.

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:06.979 align:start position:0%
(Julia)
Yeah, It's really nice.

00:04:07.012 --> 00:04:08.714
(all shouting)
Cheers.

00:04:08.747 --> 00:04:09.915
(laughing)

00:04:09.948 --> 00:04:11.417 align:start position:0%
And where is she going?

00:04:12.518 --> 00:04:14.387
Home.

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:15.388 align:start position:0%
Wait, what?

00:04:15.421 --> 00:04:16.356 align:start position:0%
Tina, no!

00:04:18.157 --> 00:04:19.592
Seriously, relax.

00:04:19.625 --> 00:04:20.760
She's just
going to her house.

00:04:22.194 --> 00:04:25.097
I gotta get clothes that I've
got to get out of the dryer.

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:26.699 align:start position:0% line:85%
(exhaling)

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:26.699 align:start size:56% position:44%
Okay, I was right.

00:04:26.732 --> 00:04:28.401 align:start size:81% position:19%
She's an actual baby lamb.

00:04:28.434 --> 00:04:30.436 align:start size:88% position:13% line:85%
Oh.

00:04:28.434 --> 00:04:30.436 align:start size:16% position:84%
Oh.

00:04:30.469 --> 00:04:32.204
(Julia)
Can I see it?

00:04:32.237 --> 00:04:33.239 size:78% position:39%
Oh.

00:04:33.272 --> 00:04:34.207
Good for them.

00:04:35.274 --> 00:04:36.242
I'm out.

00:04:36.275 --> 00:04:37.243 align:start size:41% position:59%
Okay, bye,
I'll see you.

00:04:37.276 --> 00:04:39.045 align:start size:28% position:72%
(kissing)

00:04:39.078 --> 00:04:40.513 align:start position:0%
What are you doing?

00:04:40.546 --> 00:04:42.982 align:start size:78% position:22%
I'm just gonna, um,
go home and wax my beard.

00:04:45.818 --> 00:04:47.218
When does that start?
