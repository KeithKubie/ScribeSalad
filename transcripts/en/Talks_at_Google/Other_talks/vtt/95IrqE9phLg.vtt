00:00:01.569 --> 00:00:04.710
&gt;&gt;Lexi: So please help me a welcome Frances
Frei and Anne Morriss.

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:12.250
I'm gonna do a 4 minute intro because Frances
does not like long intros and you didn't come

00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:14.160
to see me or Gretchen.

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:19.660
But Frances is one of the few people that
have had such a lasting and profound effect

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:21.890
on people's lives, not just mine and Gretchen's.

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:27.900
But how many people here have known Frances,
took her class, love her, raise it high and

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:28.900
proud.

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:34.600
Yes, the ripple effect goes far and wide across
the nation and many countries.

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:36.750
Frances teaches at Harvard Business School.

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:41.829
She, after pit diving her on my first day
looking at some regression models I asked

00:00:41.829 --> 00:00:46.710
her a series of questions that apparently
were so JV she then had a famous quote that

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:50.940
lives on in my entire family which Is, "If
I can get you to graduate I am definitely

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:51.949
making tenure."

00:00:51.949 --> 00:00:59.880
[laughter]
&gt;&gt;Lexi: She is, she doesn't lack bluntness,

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:01.940
let's put that, let's put that out there.

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:03.679
So intros are full of long credentials.

00:01:03.679 --> 00:01:06.960
Both of these women have a ton.

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.729
Frances is published in every journal you
can imagine.

00:01:09.729 --> 00:01:12.310
She has more awards than I can count.

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:14.409
And one of them is teaching excellence.

00:01:14.409 --> 00:01:16.590
She's had so many awards for teaching excellence.

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:19.460
When I asked her if I could nominate her,
she said please don't.

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:21.550
[laughter]
&gt;&gt;Lexi: Apparently, it's like having too many

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:25.250
soft skills in business school, you don't
want to be nominated for teaching excellence

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:27.640
too much.

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:30.829
Her work is especially relevant to all of
us at Google.

00:01:30.829 --> 00:01:34.600
As she is an expert in helping create value
through service.

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:38.780
She's helped organizations like Southwest,
Zappo's, eBay.

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:41.840
Think of service as a profit pool rather than
a loss leader.

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:44.369
Can I get little "woot- woot"?

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:47.689
[laughter]
&gt;&gt;Lexi: Frances has found a kindred spirit

00:01:47.689 --> 00:01:48.689
in Anne Morriss.

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:55.100
Anne has worked with companies, governments
and social entrepreneurs to unlock great potential.

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:58.580
She focuses especially on leadership and institutional
change.

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:03.530
She has cofounded an organization called Concire
Leadership Institute.

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:08.000
And I read an interview with Anne that I think
is very relevant to those of us who are people

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.810
leaders or who have people leaders which is
everyone.

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:15.550
In this group she discussed three things when
asked what's holding people back from being

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:16.620
great leaders.

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:20.850
The first is, and I think kind of encapsulates
all three,

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:25.890
Is, leaders make the mistake that thinking
that leadership is about them which is absolutely

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:26.890
wrong.

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:31.300
Leadership is all about how do you help other
people unlock the greatness and themselves.

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:33.880
Which really resonated with me.

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:39.870
In uncommon service which is a book that most
you have on your chairs or should buy immediately

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:42.050
Frances and Anne mapped a.

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:43.480
Thank you Gretchen.

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:48.090
Have mapped a roadmap for Google at this point
in our lives.

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:52.650
As we are approaching our teen years and we
need to make really tough decisions about

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:56.610
how we're gonna deliver great products and
great service.

00:02:56.610 --> 00:03:02.500
We have 13 million paid and unpaid businesses
using our products and billions of users.

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:05.080
And service is not something that comes naturally
to Google.

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:09.220
We believe you build great products and they
shouldn't need to be serviced.

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:13.410
But those of us in this room are doing a lot
of the service heavy lifting.

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:18.520
So I'm gonna turn it over to them to read
from their book and then Gretchen will ask

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:20.240
a couple questions and we'll open it up.

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:23.340
So please give a warm welcome to Frances and
Anne.

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:28.790
[applause]
&gt;&gt;Frances: This is our first book reading.

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:33.880
And given the modern way that books are sold
it's our last book reading.

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:38.050
[laughter]
&gt;&gt;Frances: So thank you for indulging us.

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:40.370
But we're thrilled to have the opportunity
to do this.

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:44.530
We, a lot of the motivation in writing the
book was to get to go and do a book reading.

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:47.130
Soâ€”
[laughter]

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:52.860
&gt;&gt;Frances: So I'll just read little bit from
the, from the introduction and then I think

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:54.550
Anne will read a little from the conclusion.

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:58.010
And then we can fill out everything in between
with a Q&amp;A.

00:03:58.010 --> 00:03:59.900
So we live and work in a service economy.

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:05.780
In 1950 industrial workers represented the
single largest employment sector in any developed

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:06.920
country.

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:12.260
Today 80% of jobs are in service and service
represents 80% of the GNP.

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:14.550
We cherish good service.

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:20.690
In survey after survey it's an enormous differentiator
in our experience as consumers.

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:24.040
Companies that deliver service excellence
get a disproportionate share of our income

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:27.840
and our loyalty to them is often very difficult
to shake.

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:31.250
In researching this book, we encountered more
than a few people who were brought to tears

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:36.440
as they recalled an empathetic insurance provider
or an airline experience that made them feel

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:41.130
human despite their screaming infants or lost
luggage.

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:44.280
We find deep meaning in the act of service.

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:47.320
We've been devising ways to take care of each
other.

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:51.150
And celebrating the results since the human
story was first documented.

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:55.570
Developmental psychologists tell us that a
willingness to help strangers is a trait that

00:04:55.570 --> 00:04:59.850
most people exhibit at as young an age as
18 months.

00:04:59.850 --> 00:05:02.220
It's an almost universal impulse to serve.

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:06.750
One they can get crowded out by other instincts
certainly but if you peel back the layers

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:11.400
of what motivates us more often than not you'll
find a very core ambition to be useful to

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:13.120
others.

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:18.400
And yet, good service is still rare.

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:22.370
In our experience as economic actors we're
increasingly frustrated and disappointed.

00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:27.130
The customers, employees, owners, no one wants
to deliver bad service.

00:05:27.130 --> 00:05:30.310
And no one wants to endure it.

00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:33.490
But that's the experience we continue to inflict
on each other.

00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:36.430
Why is that?

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:39.120
That's the question frankly that animates
this book.

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:45.210
Why is service so hard to get right despite
the fact that we are literally wired for it?

00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:47.710
Our message begins simply enough.

00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:50.310
You can't be good at everything.

00:05:50.310 --> 00:05:56.360
In services, trying to do it all brilliantly
will lead almost inevitably to mediocrity.

00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:58.710
Excellence requires sacrifice.

00:05:58.710 --> 00:06:03.930
To deliver great service on the dimensions
that your customers value most you must underperform

00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:06.840
on dimensions they value less.

00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:11.620
This means you must have the stomach to do
some things are badly.

00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:16.630
The number one obstacle to service excellence
in every organization on the planet.

00:06:16.630 --> 00:06:21.200
The number one obstacle is not having the
courage to be bad at anything.

00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:22.340
You want to be great?

00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:24.990
You have to be bad.

00:06:24.990 --> 00:06:29.780
If we try to be great at everything, we will
end up with exhausted mediocrity.

00:06:29.780 --> 00:06:34.840
And I think the thing that was so moving to
us is that well-intentioned energetic people

00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:36.560
try to be great at everything.

00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:39.639
It literally, it's a natural instinct.

00:06:39.639 --> 00:06:43.670
And it is precisely why the act of great service
is rare.

00:06:43.670 --> 00:06:47.490
So in the book, we talk about, in order to
be great you have to be bad.

00:06:47.490 --> 00:06:50.040
And the courage to be bad is what's holding
us back.

00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:52.870
We have to be very smart about which.

00:06:52.870 --> 00:06:54.620
We have to pay for great service.

00:06:54.620 --> 00:06:59.560
We need to design a reliable funding mechanism
which I think Google could.

00:06:59.560 --> 00:07:02.150
Would be helpful for some parts of the organization.

00:07:02.150 --> 00:07:06.120
[laughter]
&gt;&gt;Frances: We have to design reliable funding

00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:11.330
mechanisms into our service offerings or else
it risks being gratuitous or overlooked service.

00:07:11.330 --> 00:07:13.880
And there's a whole bunch of ways that you
can do that.

00:07:13.880 --> 00:07:15.250
So in order to be great, you have to be bad.

00:07:15.250 --> 00:07:16.250
You have to pay for it.

00:07:16.250 --> 00:07:19.450
We have to set our employees up for success.

00:07:19.450 --> 00:07:22.230
If we're not delivering excellence.

00:07:22.230 --> 00:07:26.710
If we're delivering episodic excellence it
is that we have designed the wrong jobs for

00:07:26.710 --> 00:07:28.139
our employees.

00:07:28.139 --> 00:07:33.940
The argument we make in the book, and we believe
it in our hearts is that it is our obligation

00:07:33.940 --> 00:07:37.460
to set our employees up to thrive casually.

00:07:37.460 --> 00:07:40.620
And if they're not delivering excellence,
we have not designed the right system for

00:07:40.620 --> 00:07:41.620
them.

00:07:41.620 --> 00:07:43.560
So in order to be great, you have to be bad.

00:07:43.560 --> 00:07:44.610
You have to pay for it.

00:07:44.610 --> 00:07:45.960
You have to set your employees up for success.

00:07:45.960 --> 00:07:52.020
And you have to manage and train customers
pretty aggressively in order to get there.

00:07:52.020 --> 00:07:57.010
But the one part I think that, I think that
my experience with Google is that they get

00:07:57.010 --> 00:08:00.310
that part, the first half of the sentence
manage and train customers aggressively.

00:08:00.310 --> 00:08:05.760
But the second half of the sentence is, and
they have to like you more for it.

00:08:05.760 --> 00:08:11.050
[laughter]
&gt;&gt;Frances: So those are the,

00:08:11.050 --> 00:08:12.900
Those of the first part of the design.

00:08:12.900 --> 00:08:16.570
And I'll just read one last part and then
Anne will go.

00:08:16.570 --> 00:08:19.970
Which is that the reason we wrote this book
and we wrote it together.

00:08:19.970 --> 00:08:26.050
It was just a, it was just a beautiful project
to work on together.

00:08:26.050 --> 00:08:29.450
The reason, well I'll just read to you the
last part of the introduction.

00:08:29.450 --> 00:08:31.900
In short, you want to be helpful.

00:08:31.900 --> 00:08:35.990
Our collaboration was born from the shared
belief that the commitment to serve is ingrained

00:08:35.990 --> 00:08:37.750
in the human soul.

00:08:37.750 --> 00:08:42.300
And the shared observation that this commitment
often fails to translate into sustained acts

00:08:42.300 --> 00:08:45.370
of service even with the best of intentions.

00:08:45.370 --> 00:08:50.060
I first saw this challenge in my academic
research and with executives trying to improve

00:08:50.060 --> 00:08:51.560
service in their own companies.

00:08:51.560 --> 00:08:57.500
Anne first saw it on the front lines of mission
driven organizations in the public and nonprofit

00:08:57.500 --> 00:08:59.300
sectors.

00:08:59.300 --> 00:09:02.880
She saw that good people with good ideas were
not enough.

00:09:02.880 --> 00:09:07.110
So our ambition with this book is to help
you build an organization that truly reflects

00:09:07.110 --> 00:09:08.700
your humanity.

00:09:08.700 --> 00:09:11.410
One that can shamelessly deliver uncommon
service.

00:09:11.410 --> 00:09:20.370
[Laughter and Applause]
&gt;&gt;Frances: And I can't see any of you because

00:09:20.370 --> 00:09:22.370
I can't read with my glasses on.

00:09:22.370 --> 00:09:24.529
And so you're just all a, like a very polite
blur.

00:09:24.529 --> 00:09:27.089
[laughter]
&gt;&gt;Anne: Do you want your glasses?

00:09:27.089 --> 00:09:28.410
&gt;&gt;Frances: No I don't.

00:09:28.410 --> 00:09:30.040
&gt;&gt;Anne: Are you sure?

00:09:30.040 --> 00:09:32.900
Yeah, no I like them this way.

00:09:32.900 --> 00:09:35.700
[laughter]
&gt;&gt;Anne: So I'm gonna read a little bit more.

00:09:35.700 --> 00:09:39.240
I was particularly excited about the dramatic
reading portion of the book tour.

00:09:39.240 --> 00:09:43.220
[laughter]
&gt;&gt;Anne: So this is been pent-up for a long

00:09:43.220 --> 00:09:44.220
time.

00:09:44.220 --> 00:09:48.721
[laughter]
I want to read a section from chapter 5 which

00:09:48.721 --> 00:09:50.660
is where we focus on culture.

00:09:50.660 --> 00:09:54.980
And because of the way we wrote the book and
how we present the ideas, culture often gets

00:09:54.980 --> 00:09:56.980
a little bit sidelined in the organization.

00:09:56.980 --> 00:10:02.450
But in our worldview, excellence equals design
times culture.

00:10:02.450 --> 00:10:05.480
Though both are equally as important.

00:10:05.480 --> 00:10:09.680
I mean some smart people would argue that
culture is even more important.

00:10:09.680 --> 00:10:14.860
Peter Drucker said, "Culture eats strategy
for breakfast."

00:10:14.860 --> 00:10:18.560
And I think there's a serious argument to
be made for, we would probably argue that

00:10:18.560 --> 00:10:19.560
they're about equally important.

00:10:19.560 --> 00:10:21.010
You got a get the design right.

00:10:21.010 --> 00:10:22.440
So what Frances outlined.

00:10:22.440 --> 00:10:24.450
What we call our four service truths.

00:10:24.450 --> 00:10:28.920
And you got to get the culture right for the
values that animate that design.

00:10:28.920 --> 00:10:32.780
And the often unspoken rules of engagement.

00:10:32.780 --> 00:10:37.610
So, this is an ode to culture.

00:10:37.610 --> 00:10:43.130
You know, the other piece that I think is
important in the service concept is that you

00:10:43.130 --> 00:10:49.550
know culture arguably is particularly important
in service organizations where employees have

00:10:49.550 --> 00:10:53.520
so much influence over the value creation
process.

00:10:53.520 --> 00:10:58.370
You know we all make thousands of tiny little
decisions every day.

00:10:58.370 --> 00:11:02.899
Whether it's how you answer the phone or how
you respond to an unprecedented request.

00:11:02.899 --> 00:11:06.120
And those are the choices that end up defining
the service experience.

00:11:06.120 --> 00:11:08.290
We sometimes say its culture.

00:11:08.290 --> 00:11:14.100
You know culture tells you what to do when
the CEO isn't the room which is of course

00:11:14.100 --> 00:11:17.360
most of the time.

00:11:17.360 --> 00:11:18.730
[laughter]
&gt;&gt;Anne: So our ode to culture,

00:11:18.730 --> 00:11:22.460
&gt;&gt;Frances: Not that they're bad people
&gt;&gt;Anne: No, definitely lot.

00:11:22.460 --> 00:11:28.630
This is at a Publix supermarket which I don't
know is Publix out here, it's a big supermarket

00:11:28.630 --> 00:11:31.430
chain in the South and Midwest.

00:11:31.430 --> 00:11:34.330
&gt;&gt;Lexi: Do we have Publix?

00:11:34.330 --> 00:11:35.490
&gt;&gt;Audience: No.

00:11:35.490 --> 00:11:37.010
Lexi: But we know of it.

00:11:37.010 --> 00:11:38.070
&gt;&gt;Anne: We love Publix.

00:11:38.070 --> 00:11:40.660
&gt;&gt;Lexi: It's a good shop online.

00:11:40.660 --> 00:11:45.660
&gt;&gt;Anne: A sticky misperception out there is
that a strong service culture is a luxury

00:11:45.660 --> 00:11:49.500
of small companies without the growth and
profitability pressure that the big boys have

00:11:49.500 --> 00:11:51.320
to endure.

00:11:51.320 --> 00:11:55.690
The commitment to serve is for hobby businesses.

00:11:55.690 --> 00:11:59.110
Publix supermarkets blows up this assumption
in magnificent ways.

00:11:59.110 --> 00:12:04.630
A Fortune 500 company, Publix is one of the
biggest supermarket chains in the US with

00:12:04.630 --> 00:12:07.959
annual revenues in the 25 billion range.

00:12:07.959 --> 00:12:12.900
The company employs more than 150,000 people,
the vast majority at the low end of the wage

00:12:12.900 --> 00:12:13.900
scale.

00:12:13.900 --> 00:12:19.230
And they've earned every customer service
award that exists.

00:12:19.230 --> 00:12:22.980
How has it pulled off such an exceptional
service culture at this scale?

00:12:22.980 --> 00:12:28.430
An important part of making sure everyone
gets it is the Publix guarantee.

00:12:28.430 --> 00:12:30.260
Which goes like this.

00:12:30.260 --> 00:12:35.709
"We will never knowingly disappoint you."

00:12:35.709 --> 00:12:36.709
And I love that phrase.

00:12:36.709 --> 00:12:41.170
&gt;&gt;Frances: I know, it's incredible
Anne: I think it should be in standard marriage

00:12:41.170 --> 00:12:44.000
vows.
[laughter]

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:47.750
&gt;Anne: We will never, 'cause it's about disappointment.

00:12:47.750 --> 00:12:50.160
&gt;&gt;Frances: I know it is.

00:12:50.160 --> 00:12:52.120
Forget sickness and health, whatever.

00:12:52.120 --> 00:12:53.120
Yeah, exactly.

00:12:53.120 --> 00:12:54.970
[laughter]
&gt;&gt;Anne: Yeah, yeah

00:12:54.970 --> 00:12:55.970
That's the issue.

00:12:55.970 --> 00:12:58.420
"We will never knowingly disappoint you.

00:12:58.420 --> 00:13:02.880
If for any reason your purchase does not give
you complete satisfaction, the full purchase

00:13:02.880 --> 00:13:08.110
price will be cheerfully refunded immediately
upon your request."

00:13:08.110 --> 00:13:11.220
These words are emblazoned everywhere Publix
employees looks.

00:13:11.220 --> 00:13:14.980
They're on the walls of stores, they're printed
on the back of every business card of every

00:13:14.980 --> 00:13:18.010
employee all the way to the very top of the
organization.

00:13:18.010 --> 00:13:21.160
Seriously the CEO gave you a card with.

00:13:21.160 --> 00:13:23.350
&gt;&gt;Frances: The guarantee was on the back.

00:13:23.350 --> 00:13:27.730
&gt;&gt;Anne: And the selection of words from the
cheerfully and immediately to the commitment

00:13:27.730 --> 00:13:32.420
and never intentionally disappoint, makes
exactly what the company stands for palpable

00:13:32.420 --> 00:13:37.240
to everyone who puts on a Publix name tag.

00:13:37.240 --> 00:13:41.850
The guarantee is not a mission statement that
lives and dies in the glossy annual report.

00:13:41.850 --> 00:13:45.880
It's alive and well guiding employees towards
the right behavior even in situations that

00:13:45.880 --> 00:13:50.520
are confronting them and the company for the
first time.

00:13:50.520 --> 00:13:54.839
This was true for Jim Rhodes who started out
as a meat manager in one store and 30 years

00:13:54.839 --> 00:14:00.500
later is now working as VP of human resources
for all Publix.

00:14:00.500 --> 00:14:05.440
One day the president of the company telephoned
to deploy him to go handle an irate customer

00:14:05.440 --> 00:14:11.020
who was claiming that are frozen Publix pizza
had ruined her oven.

00:14:11.020 --> 00:14:15.030
It was Rhodes day off, but he put away the
lawnmower and jumped into action, arriving

00:14:15.030 --> 00:14:17.710
at the woman's house within a few minutes.

00:14:17.710 --> 00:14:22.230
There he discovered a well-used oven that
hadn't been cleaned, ever.

00:14:22.230 --> 00:14:25.140
[laughter]
&gt;&gt;Anne: The woman had a taste for cooking

00:14:25.140 --> 00:14:28.529
pizza preferably right on the baking rack,
no pan.

00:14:28.529 --> 00:14:36.140
And so the accumulation of years of rogue
burnt ingredients had finally caught fire.

00:14:36.140 --> 00:14:40.120
As Rhodes recalled, "I didn't know anything
about customer service."

00:14:40.120 --> 00:14:43.839
But in that moment he thought about the guarantee,
the guarantee promised complete satisfaction

00:14:43.839 --> 00:14:45.550
and so that became his goal.

00:14:45.550 --> 00:14:48.880
He drove to the store, picked up a few items.

00:14:48.880 --> 00:14:55.260
Two pizzas, baking pan, putty scraper, cans
of oven cleaner and then he got on his knees

00:14:55.260 --> 00:14:58.960
and cleaned the woman's oven for her.

00:14:58.960 --> 00:15:03.620
It's the same ethos at leads Publix employees
to regularly carry packages to customers cars.

00:15:03.620 --> 00:15:05.550
To drop off groceries when customers are sick.

00:15:05.550 --> 00:15:08.990
To never knowingly disappoint.

00:15:08.990 --> 00:15:13.630
Not only has the culture survived in spite
of the company size and success, it has been

00:15:13.630 --> 00:15:15.390
a central driver of it.

00:15:15.390 --> 00:15:20.370
It's a deadly serious asset cultivated by
a soberly ambitious company.

00:15:20.370 --> 00:15:23.370
&gt;&gt;Frances: I got goose bumps.

00:15:23.370 --> 00:15:26.370
[laughter]
&gt;&gt;Anne: That's so sweet.

00:15:26.370 --> 00:15:28.769
&gt;&gt;Frances: Yeah, I know.

00:15:28.769 --> 00:15:32.720
&gt;&gt;Anne: And so I'm just gonna read then the
conclusion which is only, which is only a

00:15:32.720 --> 00:15:33.720
page.

00:15:33.720 --> 00:15:41.680
But we like it because it speaks to why we
think it's worth our time to think about how

00:15:41.680 --> 00:15:43.810
to get better at service.

00:15:43.810 --> 00:15:52.650
And as Frances spoke to in the introduction
essentially we have to get this right.

00:15:52.650 --> 00:15:56.589
This is the primary driver of our economy.

00:15:56.589 --> 00:15:59.610
That's true now and that's gonna be true tomorrow.

00:15:59.610 --> 00:16:04.480
You know 50 years ago it was about 50/50 manufacturing
and services.

00:16:04.480 --> 00:16:09.600
Right now it's 80% and it doesn't matter how
nostalgic we get about making things or how

00:16:09.600 --> 00:16:13.920
many speeches our President makes about the
importance of the manufacturing sector our

00:16:13.920 --> 00:16:15.970
futures is in services.

00:16:15.970 --> 00:16:21.839
That's true for the US and that's increasingly
true for developing countries, where the stakes

00:16:21.839 --> 00:16:23.149
are even higher.

00:16:23.149 --> 00:16:26.529
So we need to figure out how to build great
service companies and we need to figure out

00:16:26.529 --> 00:16:29.620
how to create great service jobs.

00:16:29.620 --> 00:16:35.600
And this is our final plea for that.

00:16:35.600 --> 00:16:41.910
A maddening thing about service organizations
is that they permit you to lie to yourself.

00:16:41.910 --> 00:16:45.000
You get to believe that you can be great at
everything.

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:48.910
You get to pretend that your employees are
your problem or that your customers won't

00:16:48.910 --> 00:16:51.760
notice when your commitment to them falters.

00:16:51.760 --> 00:16:55.480
And the cost is not failure, at least not
at first.

00:16:55.480 --> 00:16:59.360
Just an insistent unsatisfying mediocrity.

00:16:59.360 --> 00:17:02.100
The antidote is honesty.

00:17:02.100 --> 00:17:07.679
The path to uncommon service goes directly
and sometimes painfully through the mirror.

00:17:07.679 --> 00:17:11.799
Our goal in writing this book is to help you
hold that mirror up to yourself and to your

00:17:11.799 --> 00:17:12.799
own organization.

00:17:12.799 --> 00:17:16.259
If you haven't averted your eyes at this point
in the story than were optimistic about your

00:17:16.259 --> 00:17:19.339
capacity to excel.

00:17:19.339 --> 00:17:23.270
It's of course easier for us as outsiders
to look without blinking.

00:17:23.270 --> 00:17:27.470
But here's why were credible in pushing you
to do it.

00:17:27.470 --> 00:17:32.149
After studying the design and culture of countless
organizations, we know that what you'll discover

00:17:32.149 --> 00:17:34.690
is likely to amaze you.

00:17:34.690 --> 00:17:39.149
Customers who are yearning to be of service,
or employees who are yearning to be of service.

00:17:39.149 --> 00:17:41.669
Customers who are eager to do their part.

00:17:41.669 --> 00:17:44.570
Organizations that can in fact change overnight.

00:17:44.570 --> 00:17:46.679
And not just organizations.

00:17:46.679 --> 00:17:52.429
In 1995 when Carlos Rodriguez Pastor return
from Peru, returned to Peru from the United

00:17:52.429 --> 00:17:56.529
States to take a hard look at his own family
business a financial services company known

00:17:56.529 --> 00:17:58.379
as Interbank.

00:17:58.379 --> 00:18:03.020
He saw his companies and his country's weaknesses
with great clarity.

00:18:03.020 --> 00:18:06.119
But everywhere he looked he also saw the potential
for greatness.

00:18:06.119 --> 00:18:11.700
He saw opportunities to create unprecedented
prosperity in a nation still fighting its

00:18:11.700 --> 00:18:14.659
way out of entrenched poverty and economic
turmoil.

00:18:14.659 --> 00:18:20.369
Rodriguez bet on the future of both Interbank
and Peru by building a services empire.

00:18:20.369 --> 00:18:24.730
Everything from grocery stores to insurance
to schools that delivers excellence to the

00:18:24.730 --> 00:18:27.070
country's emerging middle class.

00:18:27.070 --> 00:18:32.289
The Interbank Group's $8 billion portfolio
takes his inspiration from global service

00:18:32.289 --> 00:18:33.289
leaders.

00:18:33.289 --> 00:18:36.640
And its exceptional performance is fueled
by an unflinching look at the gaps between

00:18:36.640 --> 00:18:39.630
its own companies and the world's best.

00:18:39.630 --> 00:18:45.520
The result, Interbank is now generated wealth
for more than 30,000 employees who are in

00:18:45.520 --> 00:18:48.700
turn nurturing the wealth of a nation.

00:18:48.700 --> 00:18:50.200
The way Rodriguez tells it.

00:18:50.200 --> 00:18:54.749
The country's motto was once a dispiriting
and fatalistic "si pero."

00:18:54.749 --> 00:18:57.700
Spanish for "Yes, but..."
[laughter]

00:18:57.700 --> 00:19:03.749
&gt;&gt;Anne: His life's ambition is to turn the
country signature phrase into "Si Peru", "Yes

00:19:03.749 --> 00:19:04.749
Peru."

00:19:04.749 --> 00:19:06.879
He's already made extraordinary progress.

00:19:06.879 --> 00:19:11.950
Interbank is arguably the most influential
company in an economy that's now booming at

00:19:11.950 --> 00:19:16.690
a pace that's convinced Peru's brightest minds
to turn down jobs in New York and London and

00:19:16.690 --> 00:19:20.720
Silicon Valley and build their careers at
home.

00:19:20.720 --> 00:19:25.239
With the humility of someone in a much bigger
game than personal advancement Rodriguez has

00:19:25.239 --> 00:19:28.070
deep calm about him.

00:19:28.070 --> 00:19:32.440
His impatience for a new Peru is filtered
into a careful mix of words and actions starting

00:19:32.440 --> 00:19:36.909
with his bedrock refusal to accept mediocrity
around him.

00:19:36.909 --> 00:19:42.809
He is standing for excellence and that choice
is changing a country.

00:19:42.809 --> 00:19:46.269
People ask us all the time where they should
begin.

00:19:46.269 --> 00:19:51.330
Our advice is to first believe in an alternate
reality where ordinary people create extraordinary

00:19:51.330 --> 00:19:54.850
value for customers ready to take on the world.

00:19:54.850 --> 00:19:59.500
Like Rodriguez, you must believe in the possibility
and then look fearlessly at your distance

00:19:59.500 --> 00:20:01.210
from it.

00:20:01.210 --> 00:20:04.950
And if you start to doubt where the journey
ends, please track us down.

00:20:04.950 --> 00:20:08.580
We'd be delighted to tell you another story
of uncommon service.

00:20:08.580 --> 00:20:17.379
[applause]
&gt;&gt;Gretchen: We just want you to do that iambic

00:20:17.379 --> 00:20:18.970
pentameter next, okay.

00:20:18.970 --> 00:20:22.570
[laughter]
&gt;&gt;Anne: Yeah but you're the only ones.

00:20:22.570 --> 00:20:26.639
&gt;&gt;Gretchen: Okay so I'm gonna, I want you
to all start thinking of questions.

00:20:26.639 --> 00:20:33.600
And again if the VC folks have questions,
e-mail aparde, A-P-A-R-D-E and we will ask

00:20:33.600 --> 00:20:35.169
them for you.

00:20:35.169 --> 00:20:39.359
So at Google and in this room we have different
types of,

00:20:39.359 --> 00:20:41.970
we're not known as a service organization
per se.

00:20:41.970 --> 00:20:43.769
&gt;&gt;Frances: Yes
&gt;&gt;Gretchen: As Google as a whole.

00:20:43.769 --> 00:20:44.769
Right?

00:20:44.769 --> 00:20:47.950
But in this room we have folks that manage
internal service operations.

00:20:47.950 --> 00:20:49.570
So within group to group.

00:20:49.570 --> 00:20:53.530
But also the service operations to our customers.

00:20:53.530 --> 00:20:59.820
What, I think to Anne's point, one of the
things that keeps sticking in my mind is the

00:20:59.820 --> 00:21:03.649
Publix mission statement of not, what is it,
knowingly disappoint

00:21:03.649 --> 00:21:05.210
&gt;&gt;Anne: Yep.

00:21:05.210 --> 00:21:10.019
&gt;&gt;Gretchen: I'm having a hard time, and I
would love your perspective on applying that

00:21:10.019 --> 00:21:11.590
to Google's philosophy.

00:21:11.590 --> 00:21:17.590
Because I think in our launch and iterate
culture where we put things out there knowingly

00:21:17.590 --> 00:21:18.950
that they're not perfect.

00:21:18.950 --> 00:21:22.029
We definitely knowingly disappoint our users
at times.

00:21:22.029 --> 00:21:26.489
The idea is that we will get to a better place
because we're going to listen and iterate

00:21:26.489 --> 00:21:27.489
on it.

00:21:27.489 --> 00:21:31.700
But I think that also presents challenges
for our service folks both internally and

00:21:31.700 --> 00:21:33.429
externally with our customers.

00:21:33.429 --> 00:21:37.429
But also with our users for understanding
why we would make some of these decisions.

00:21:37.429 --> 00:21:39.989
Can you comment on just your thoughts on sort
of that?

00:21:39.989 --> 00:21:41.609
&gt;&gt;Frances: Can I go first?

00:21:41.609 --> 00:21:42.909
&gt;&gt;Anne: Yeah
Frances: Please.

00:21:42.909 --> 00:21:47.330
So I don't think that you disappoint customers
when you put things out there in a beta version

00:21:47.330 --> 00:21:50.039
and they experience the functionality not
working.

00:21:50.039 --> 00:21:52.239
You, that's what you stand for.

00:21:52.239 --> 00:21:53.980
It's what you communicate.

00:21:53.980 --> 00:21:55.820
Those constraints are very clear.

00:21:55.820 --> 00:22:00.739
I think you disappoint customers when you
won't talk to them.

00:22:00.739 --> 00:22:04.369
[laughter]
&gt;&gt;Frances: When you make it really, really

00:22:04.369 --> 00:22:07.759
difficult for them to talk to you about what
they are experiencing.

00:22:07.759 --> 00:22:13.299
But I think the put out early and iterate
with them and have them create more value

00:22:13.299 --> 00:22:14.299
with you.

00:22:14.299 --> 00:22:17.830
That is, that is in my sense not at all where
you have disappointment.

00:22:17.830 --> 00:22:20.369
And you shouldn't hesitate for doing that.

00:22:20.369 --> 00:22:25.210
It's what makes, so the products in which
you thrive, thrive because of that.

00:22:25.210 --> 00:22:27.009
So that's part of the secret sauce.

00:22:27.009 --> 00:22:29.669
&gt;&gt;Anne: Yeah I would agree.

00:22:29.669 --> 00:22:32.419
That feels like a collaborative iteration.

00:22:32.419 --> 00:22:34.590
Innovation experience.

00:22:34.590 --> 00:22:39.870
The definition of excellence that we use is
that is being great at the things your customers

00:22:39.870 --> 00:22:41.590
value most?

00:22:41.590 --> 00:22:46.460
And then making trade-offs in the area that
they value least or at least value less.

00:22:46.460 --> 00:22:51.529
And I think where some service organization
stumble is that they're making trade-offs

00:22:51.529 --> 00:22:54.149
but they're not making trade-offs in the areas
that customers don't value, they're making

00:22:54.149 --> 00:22:56.669
trade-offs in areas that the customers do
value.

00:22:56.669 --> 00:23:03.240
And, you know, answering the phone when you
call hypothetically could be you know a thing

00:23:03.240 --> 00:23:04.519
your customers value right?

00:23:04.519 --> 00:23:10.260
&gt;&gt;Gretchen: So going back to an earlier point
you made following up on this is that we you

00:23:10.260 --> 00:23:13.919
know, you want to be excellent you need to
do some things poorly.

00:23:13.919 --> 00:23:14.919
Right?

00:23:14.919 --> 00:23:15.919
Or bad.

00:23:15.919 --> 00:23:16.919
&gt;&gt;Frances: Bad.

00:23:16.919 --> 00:23:17.919
&gt;&gt;Gretchen: As you said bad.

00:23:17.919 --> 00:23:18.919
Just purely bad.

00:23:18.919 --> 00:23:21.019
[laughter]
&gt;&gt;Gretchen: In terms of talking to our customers

00:23:21.019 --> 00:23:22.669
our ability to do that.

00:23:22.669 --> 00:23:26.279
I think we have made great strides and hopefully
we'll get questions from the audience or comments

00:23:26.279 --> 00:23:30.619
around talking to our advertisers or people
who are paying for our products.

00:23:30.619 --> 00:23:31.649
Probably still not perfect yet.

00:23:31.649 --> 00:23:34.980
But over the last couple years we've made
huge strides there.

00:23:34.980 --> 00:23:38.210
We still don't have that for our free products.

00:23:38.210 --> 00:23:41.070
And that's a trade-off that we've had to make
right?

00:23:41.070 --> 00:23:42.520
One fundsâ€”
&gt;&gt;Frances: Yeah

00:23:42.520 --> 00:23:43.749
&gt;&gt;Gretchen: the other.

00:23:43.749 --> 00:23:50.259
Thoughts on that in terms of the brand as
a whole and how, again, we can balance that

00:23:50.259 --> 00:23:51.259
complication.

00:23:51.259 --> 00:23:54.580
&gt;&gt;Frances: So it's definitely the case that
you don't have to treat everyone the same

00:23:54.580 --> 00:23:55.580
way.

00:23:55.580 --> 00:24:00.019
Like I think that Armani boutique and Armani
exchange have two very different service models

00:24:00.019 --> 00:24:02.440
and the customers are very accepting of it.

00:24:02.440 --> 00:24:06.350
And so I think that is fine.

00:24:06.350 --> 00:24:11.789
I think the challenge is when you struggle
to meet the needs of the customers I think

00:24:11.789 --> 00:24:13.110
it's really well-intentioned.

00:24:13.110 --> 00:24:15.140
I've never seen your management reports.

00:24:15.140 --> 00:24:17.270
But I suspect they're some version of color-coded.

00:24:17.270 --> 00:24:21.830
So these are Green, these are Yellow, and
these are Red.

00:24:21.830 --> 00:24:25.059
That will lead to exhausted mediocrity.

00:24:25.059 --> 00:24:30.049
Because you'll play some corporate version
of whack-a-mole going after the current Reds.

00:24:30.049 --> 00:24:35.590
There are some Reds that we should be proud
of.

00:24:35.590 --> 00:24:38.960
Go onboard Southwest Airlines and ask for
a meal.

00:24:38.960 --> 00:24:43.190
[laughter]
&gt;&gt;Frances: They will not have shame.

00:24:43.190 --> 00:24:46.009
They might mock you.

00:24:46.009 --> 00:24:49.830
But we have to be equally unapologetic about
what were designed to be great at and what

00:24:49.830 --> 00:24:51.099
were designed to be bad at.

00:24:51.099 --> 00:24:57.129
And so I would say that if you have read yellow
and green, we need two shades of red.

00:24:57.129 --> 00:25:01.059
There's some red that if it's not in the service
of great, get better at it.

00:25:01.059 --> 00:25:04.609
There's another red that is in the service
of excellence that's the last thing we should

00:25:04.609 --> 00:25:06.600
do is get better at it.

00:25:06.600 --> 00:25:07.669
I like to call that red maroon.

00:25:07.669 --> 00:25:09.149
&gt;&gt;Lexi: Red Moon?

00:25:09.149 --> 00:25:11.129
&gt;&gt;Frances: Not red, maroon.

00:25:11.129 --> 00:25:12.619
&gt;&gt;Gretchen: Red maroon.

00:25:12.619 --> 00:25:15.409
&gt;&gt;Male audience member: Is that a thing against
HBS?

00:25:15.409 --> 00:25:18.320
&gt;&gt;Frances It's a cheap, no that's a bad part
of being bad that you should be proud of.

00:25:18.320 --> 00:25:25.240
We have plenty of that at HBS
&gt;&gt;Lexi: So maroon also has multiple meanings.

00:25:25.240 --> 00:25:26.899
"Marooned on an island."

00:25:26.899 --> 00:25:31.399
[laughter]
&gt;&gt;Lexi: And I like just going with the dramatic.

00:25:31.399 --> 00:25:33.190
[laughter]
&gt;&gt;Gretchen: I like that.

00:25:33.190 --> 00:25:36.049
&gt;&gt;Lexi: I thought you were already there.

00:25:36.049 --> 00:25:38.779
&gt;&gt;Gretchen: I'm so slowly literal.

00:25:38.779 --> 00:25:40.999
We're gonna open up questions.

00:25:40.999 --> 00:25:42.519
Does anyone have questions in the audience?

00:25:42.519 --> 00:25:44.309
Alright, were gonna have to run around to,
to mikes.

00:25:44.309 --> 00:25:45.489
Ms. Minnie.

00:25:45.489 --> 00:25:47.389
&gt;&gt;Lexi: I think we'll just repeat maybe.

00:25:47.389 --> 00:25:48.389
&gt;&gt;Gretchen: Oh, ok.

00:25:48.389 --> 00:25:50.399
&gt;&gt;Lexi: To save pregnant ladies not running.

00:25:50.399 --> 00:25:53.399
[laughter]
&gt;&gt;Minnie: I wanted to talk about culture some

00:25:53.399 --> 00:25:54.399
more.

00:25:54.399 --> 00:25:55.399
&gt;&gt;Frances: Yep.

00:25:55.399 --> 00:25:58.419
So people always ask me what I like most about
Google and I always say well I really like

00:25:58.419 --> 00:26:01.809
the culture and I've never known what I'm
saying when I say that.

00:26:01.809 --> 00:26:04.409
[laughter]
&gt;&gt;Minnie: And people often ask me what I mean

00:26:04.409 --> 00:26:05.409
when I say that.

00:26:05.409 --> 00:26:07.720
And I sort of give a different answer every
time.

00:26:07.720 --> 00:26:13.369
And I think your answer was that you know
what to do when CEO is not in the room.

00:26:13.369 --> 00:26:17.289
Could you elaborate on that 'cause that doesn't
quite answer my question.

00:26:17.289 --> 00:26:18.289
&gt;&gt;Frances: Sure.

00:26:18.289 --> 00:26:19.289
&gt;&gt;Anne: Sure.

00:26:19.289 --> 00:26:20.289
&gt;&gt;Frances: So you want to or do you want me
to.

00:26:20.289 --> 00:26:21.289
&gt;&gt;Anne: Why don't you start?

00:26:21.289 --> 00:26:27.369
So our definition of culture is that culture
guides discretionary behavior in the absence

00:26:27.369 --> 00:26:30.529
of a stated policy, in the absence of direct
supervision.

00:26:30.529 --> 00:26:36.470
The whole purpose to have a culture is that
people are behaving as we want them to behave

00:26:36.470 --> 00:26:38.450
even when they're not being watched.

00:26:38.450 --> 00:26:39.450
Right?

00:26:39.450 --> 00:26:40.450
So that's the purpose of it.

00:26:40.450 --> 00:26:43.460
Here's the "secret sauce" of culture.

00:26:43.460 --> 00:26:46.470
Culture exists to guide discretionary behavior.

00:26:46.470 --> 00:26:51.599
If you want people to change their behavior
you can't address behavior directly.

00:26:51.599 --> 00:26:53.650
Will-power doesn't work.

00:26:53.650 --> 00:27:00.149
So, but here is how you can influence people's
behavior and change can happen in an instant.

00:27:00.149 --> 00:27:05.269
When we realize that the way in which we behave
manifests from how we think.

00:27:05.269 --> 00:27:06.659
Thinking manifests behavior.

00:27:06.659 --> 00:27:08.259
You want someone to behave differently?

00:27:08.259 --> 00:27:10.960
You have to credibly get them to think differently.

00:27:10.960 --> 00:27:17.099
I think the reason you love Google's culture
is because everyone, all of the unspoken things,

00:27:17.099 --> 00:27:23.409
everyone here is great and kind and they take
care of each other in ways that are, it's

00:27:23.409 --> 00:27:24.409
inspiring.

00:27:24.409 --> 00:27:27.320
I mean when I'm walking around here today
it's inspiring how much care people take.

00:27:27.320 --> 00:27:29.529
It's there discretionary acts.

00:27:29.529 --> 00:27:31.779
I don't think people were told to do that.

00:27:31.779 --> 00:27:35.840
I think we have influenced how people think
and that manifests in that behavior.

00:27:35.840 --> 00:27:39.809
&gt;&gt;Minnie: I actually always answer that it's
the morality of the place.

00:27:39.809 --> 00:27:40.809
&gt;&gt;Frances: I think that's good.

00:27:40.809 --> 00:27:42.769
&gt;&gt;Anne: But I think you know values are a
big part of it.

00:27:42.769 --> 00:27:45.309
I mean we're very, very practical people.

00:27:45.309 --> 00:27:48.499
I'm from Ohio and you studied math.
[laughter]

00:27:48.499 --> 00:27:52.419
&gt;&gt;Anne: So you know in the book.

00:27:52.419 --> 00:27:58.080
[laughter]
&gt;&gt;Anne: We actually get into, you know hands

00:27:58.080 --> 00:28:00.929
dirty in the question of actually how do you
design a culture?

00:28:00.929 --> 00:28:01.929
How do you build it?

00:28:01.929 --> 00:28:02.929
How do you make it happen?

00:28:02.929 --> 00:28:06.279
And we divided up basically into kinda three
challenges.

00:28:06.279 --> 00:28:10.229
And the first, unfortunately they're all C,
I really tried hard not to make them all C's

00:28:10.229 --> 00:28:11.929
coming from a business school environment.

00:28:11.929 --> 00:28:13.390
The three C's of culture.

00:28:13.390 --> 00:28:18.489
So, but the first piece is clarity which is
really understanding what kind of culture

00:28:18.489 --> 00:28:20.029
you want to build and why.

00:28:20.029 --> 00:28:24.570
You know what's important in terms of Google
competing is gonna be very different from

00:28:24.570 --> 00:28:27.059
Publix or another organization.

00:28:27.059 --> 00:28:29.750
So really understanding, you know, what are
those values?

00:28:29.750 --> 00:28:31.669
Know how do you want people think?

00:28:31.669 --> 00:28:38.039
And some of the great examples of companies
that have crystal clear understanding of that.

00:28:38.039 --> 00:28:40.710
You know Zappo's is the one that really stands
out.

00:28:40.710 --> 00:28:45.909
And you know Tony Shay talks about the 10
Google values literally almost every time

00:28:45.909 --> 00:28:47.250
he gets a microphone.

00:28:47.250 --> 00:28:48.460
&gt;&gt;Frances: He does Zappo's.

00:28:48.460 --> 00:28:49.460
&gt;&gt;Audience: Yeah.

00:28:49.460 --> 00:28:51.570
&gt;&gt;Lexi: Instead of Google values.

00:28:51.570 --> 00:28:52.570
&gt;&gt;Anne: Yeah.

00:28:52.570 --> 00:28:54.109
I'm already getting excited.

00:28:54.109 --> 00:28:57.570
[laughter]
&gt;&gt;Anne: So and then the other pieces is then

00:28:57.570 --> 00:29:02.029
communicating those values, and particularly
in moments where employees hearts and minds

00:29:02.029 --> 00:29:03.029
are open.

00:29:03.029 --> 00:29:04.049
So in training environments.

00:29:04.049 --> 00:29:06.190
You know right when people walk in.

00:29:06.190 --> 00:29:09.389
Making sure that you're signaling that.

00:29:09.389 --> 00:29:14.159
And then the consistency piece which is making
sure that there aren't what we call cultural

00:29:14.159 --> 00:29:15.159
breaks.

00:29:15.159 --> 00:29:16.769
All over the organization which happens a
lot.

00:29:16.769 --> 00:29:20.100
Which is, you know, we declare service matters
and then in fact you're not picking up the

00:29:20.100 --> 00:29:21.580
phone.

00:29:21.580 --> 00:29:26.019
And you know that's a good place to start
in many organization is to root out those

00:29:26.019 --> 00:29:27.019
breaks.

00:29:27.019 --> 00:29:28.539
&gt;&gt;Frances: And we just, I know you want to
talk, let me just say one.

00:29:28.539 --> 00:29:32.950
Call centers are sort of notoriously designed
to fail, so they're a great place to think

00:29:32.950 --> 00:29:36.499
about it when we tell the employees in the
morning that the customer is what we're about.

00:29:36.499 --> 00:29:39.969
And then we tell the employees in the afternoon
that you have to do it in 180 second increments

00:29:39.969 --> 00:29:43.659
[laughter]
&gt;&gt;Frances: Those are the disconnects that

00:29:43.659 --> 00:29:45.619
really make you.

00:29:45.619 --> 00:29:47.659
It would be impossible to have a great culture
in that environment.

00:29:47.659 --> 00:29:53.149
&gt;&gt;male audience member #1: Hi I'm [inaudible],
I'm actually working in customer service department

00:29:53.149 --> 00:29:54.149
here.

00:29:54.149 --> 00:29:55.349
&gt;&gt;Frances: I don't think you're mike's on.

00:29:55.349 --> 00:29:58.519
&gt;&gt;male audience member #1: I'm actually working
in the customer service department here.

00:29:58.519 --> 00:30:05.360
I had a question about your Publix example
which is relatively, like a big organization.

00:30:05.360 --> 00:30:09.749
And I understand that culture kind of is the
kit of bringing this all together.

00:30:09.749 --> 00:30:14.919
But can you say something about incentive
systems to incentivize this?

00:30:14.919 --> 00:30:16.019
This kind of culture.

00:30:16.019 --> 00:30:22.350
And kind of empower like the employees to
fulfill this promise to the customer.

00:30:22.350 --> 00:30:29.519
&gt;&gt;Frances: So the, the most powerful incentives
in any organization are informal status.

00:30:29.519 --> 00:30:32.379
So we all think that it's monetary rewards.

00:30:32.379 --> 00:30:37.470
And there's not a single study that shows
that that, that those instrumental things

00:30:37.470 --> 00:30:39.710
work much at all.

00:30:39.710 --> 00:30:43.960
Incentives, formal incentives solve almost
no problems.

00:30:43.960 --> 00:30:47.220
Dysfunctional incentives create a lot of problems.

00:30:47.220 --> 00:30:53.499
The biggest barometer, the biggest lever you
have to influence culture is how you bestow

00:30:53.499 --> 00:30:54.789
informal status.

00:30:54.789 --> 00:30:57.479
Who do you give your attention to?

00:30:57.479 --> 00:31:00.749
Who do you give your distraction to?

00:31:00.749 --> 00:31:03.769
At what moments do you celebrate?

00:31:03.769 --> 00:31:06.499
That is what infuses a culture.

00:31:06.499 --> 00:31:14.379
So incentives matter madly but it's the informal,
it's the informal ones that matter.

00:31:14.379 --> 00:31:18.879
I often say that your biggest cultural weapon
is your, and I don't, it's probably politically

00:31:18.879 --> 00:31:20.450
incorrect to have this.

00:31:20.450 --> 00:31:23.940
&gt;&gt;Anne: Go for it.

00:31:23.940 --> 00:31:25.369
&gt;&gt;Frances: Is your Blackberry.

00:31:25.369 --> 00:31:27.129
[laughter]
&gt;&gt;Frances: Because for whom when they're speaking

00:31:27.129 --> 00:31:30.109
do you bring out your Blackberry.

00:31:30.109 --> 00:31:33.299
That is what is infusing your culture every
day.

00:31:33.299 --> 00:31:35.479
Everything else pales in comparison.

00:31:35.479 --> 00:31:40.000
&gt;&gt;male audience member #2: I also work with
a lot of the advertisers.

00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:44.489
So you know we're all part of a team that
actually talks directly to our advertisers.

00:31:44.489 --> 00:31:46.899
At least the small and medium-size businesses.

00:31:46.899 --> 00:31:50.440
And it's interesting, I kind of gave a little
squeal when you mentioned that you talked

00:31:50.440 --> 00:31:53.139
to somebody that worked at Interbank or kind
of the president of Interbank.

00:31:53.139 --> 00:31:55.570
'Cause I lived in Peru for a year.

00:31:55.570 --> 00:31:59.460
And when I went there, I would constantly
go to Interbank to do my currency exchanges

00:31:59.460 --> 00:32:01.090
because they were always open so late.

00:32:01.090 --> 00:32:06.119
So, I'd go to the grocery store, they're open
'til like 9 PM most nights.

00:32:06.119 --> 00:32:11.509
Then it got me thinking we're only available
9 AM to 8 PM Eastern Standard Time.

00:32:11.509 --> 00:32:16.059
So what is your opinion on kind of 24-hour
service?

00:32:16.059 --> 00:32:22.169
Or how long, if we're going to be interacting
with our advertisers, how long do you think

00:32:22.169 --> 00:32:24.080
is an acceptable time frame to be available?

00:32:24.080 --> 00:32:30.969
&gt;&gt;Frances: So the, I met Carlos when he came
to take an Exec Ed course called achieving

00:32:30.969 --> 00:32:32.509
breakthrough service.

00:32:32.509 --> 00:32:34.099
And he brought 11 people from Interbank.

00:32:34.099 --> 00:32:37.849
In the first case we taught there was a case
called Commerce Bank.

00:32:37.849 --> 00:32:41.250
And Commerce Bank became the fastest-growing
bank in the US.

00:32:41.250 --> 00:32:43.649
By differentiating on a couple of aspects
of service.

00:32:43.649 --> 00:32:45.710
By trying to be great at some aspects.

00:32:45.710 --> 00:32:48.999
And realizing that the only way to do it was
to be really bad at others.

00:32:48.999 --> 00:32:51.509
And this Commerce Bank really infused Carlos.

00:32:51.509 --> 00:32:56.690
And when he went back to Interbank he used
this in most of his organizations.

00:32:56.690 --> 00:33:02.190
So the trick that we learn from Commerce is
that they're open, all night, all day Saturday,

00:33:02.190 --> 00:33:04.499
all day Sunday with full-service banking.

00:33:04.499 --> 00:33:07.969
And the first question you ask is how can
they afford it?

00:33:07.969 --> 00:33:11.169
Their tagline was that they're America's most
convenient Bank.

00:33:11.169 --> 00:33:15.489
But their unofficial tagline was "No one will
pay you less for your money than we will."

00:33:15.489 --> 00:33:18.479
[laughter]
&gt;&gt;Frances: You received a half a percentage

00:33:18.479 --> 00:33:20.649
point less on deposits.

00:33:20.649 --> 00:33:23.330
And it was open beyond banker's hours.

00:33:23.330 --> 00:33:29.179
And so when Carlos and Interbank are giving
you extended hours they're optimizing to be

00:33:29.179 --> 00:33:30.580
best in class at that.

00:33:30.580 --> 00:33:33.549
They're absolutely doing something else to
fund it.

00:33:33.549 --> 00:33:38.320
And so what you don't want to do is just incur
more and more cost on service.

00:33:38.320 --> 00:33:42.089
We want to really figure it out from an optimization,
and it's a constrained optimization.

00:33:42.089 --> 00:33:45.039
And if you're gonna be disproportionately
great at that, what are you gonna be less

00:33:45.039 --> 00:33:46.039
good at?

00:33:46.039 --> 00:33:51.279
&gt;&gt;Anne: And we would argue that of course
depends very heavily on your, the needs of

00:33:51.279 --> 00:33:52.740
your target customers.

00:33:52.740 --> 00:33:56.039
And probably the most painful part of the
book.

00:33:56.039 --> 00:34:02.080
We spend a lot of time just describing a customer
learning tool and process that helps you to

00:34:02.080 --> 00:34:05.690
surface what are your customer needs, and
how would you prioritize them and help you

00:34:05.690 --> 00:34:07.360
work through some of the tradeoffs.

00:34:07.360 --> 00:34:11.760
And so if your customers care about 24-hour
service then we would say yes definitely it's

00:34:11.760 --> 00:34:14.460
worth considering you know extending the hours.

00:34:14.460 --> 00:34:19.070
&gt;&gt;Frances: And when Anne says it's the most
painful, I mean beautifully written, but painful

00:34:19.070 --> 00:34:20.070
to go through.

00:34:20.070 --> 00:34:23.640
But if you are looking to use it in a practical
way, it's the second half of Chapter 1.

00:34:23.640 --> 00:34:30.070
&gt;&gt;Anne: And we actually created a tool on
our website which is uncommonservice.com that

00:34:30.070 --> 00:34:31.890
isâ€”
&gt;&gt;Frances: Tells you exactly how to do it

00:34:31.890 --> 00:34:34.230
&gt;&gt;Anne: That walks you through it step by
step.

00:34:34.230 --> 00:34:38.399
And it was our attempt to make that part of
the book less painful.

00:34:38.399 --> 00:34:41.690
And you can just download it.

00:34:41.690 --> 00:34:44.700
&gt;&gt;Michelle: Hi, my name is Michelle.

00:34:44.700 --> 00:34:47.860
And I work in the REWS division which is real
estate and workplace services.

00:34:47.860 --> 00:34:52.260
Our tagline is "We are what makes Google googly."

00:34:52.260 --> 00:34:54.210
We take care the employees.

00:34:54.210 --> 00:34:56.800
My area isâ€”
&gt;&gt;Frances: What an awesome job to do at this

00:34:56.800 --> 00:34:57.800
company.

00:34:57.800 --> 00:35:00.620
&gt;&gt;Michelle: It's an awesome job, and I think
it relates to customer service.

00:35:00.620 --> 00:35:05.500
My specific area is in health and productivity
management and how we take care of our employees

00:35:05.500 --> 00:35:08.650
for sustained performance and peak performance.

00:35:08.650 --> 00:35:11.480
Who are your top leaders do you see in this
area?

00:35:11.480 --> 00:35:18.720
And I'm particularly interested in your chapter
around successful employee management systems.

00:35:18.720 --> 00:35:23.200
What are companies doing, the cutting-edge
innovative companies doing to take care of

00:35:23.200 --> 00:35:24.200
our employees?

00:35:24.200 --> 00:35:27.740
They work very hard 12, 15, 17 hours a day.

00:35:27.740 --> 00:35:34.140
We also give them incredible food, fitness,
massage, top-of-the-line health care benefits.

00:35:34.140 --> 00:35:36.250
But at a price.

00:35:36.250 --> 00:35:38.080
And when does the service person burnout.

00:35:38.080 --> 00:35:39.080
&gt;&gt;Frances: Yeah.

00:35:39.080 --> 00:35:40.640
Do you wanna repeat any of that?

00:35:40.640 --> 00:35:44.180
I'm just, I can justâ€”
&gt;&gt;Lexi: Yeah, that's fine

00:35:44.180 --> 00:35:46.300
I think it's just that our mikes are a little
low.

00:35:46.300 --> 00:35:50.360
So the question is really, this is a woman
who works for providing services for all of

00:35:50.360 --> 00:35:51.360
us.

00:35:51.360 --> 00:35:52.360
From real estate to benefits.

00:35:52.360 --> 00:35:56.110
Who are some top leaders who are providing
similar services in other companies?

00:35:56.110 --> 00:36:00.870
And how do you keep doing this when that is
most definitely high cost?

00:36:00.870 --> 00:36:03.050
And when you make trade-offs.

00:36:03.050 --> 00:36:06.590
&gt;&gt;Frances: So we have in the introduction
we call the cast of characters.

00:36:06.590 --> 00:36:11.640
And we introduce, and so I'll just,
the companies that make a lot of appearances

00:36:11.640 --> 00:36:14.890
are the ones that are gonna be disproportionately
useful to look at.

00:36:14.890 --> 00:36:16.620
So Commerce Bank is the first one that we
talk about.

00:36:16.620 --> 00:36:21.130
But they were bought by Toronto Dominion and
ruined.

00:36:21.130 --> 00:36:26.190
[laughter]
&gt;&gt;Frances: Which, you know most great service

00:36:26.190 --> 00:36:28.750
organizations when they get bought by someone
else.

00:36:28.750 --> 00:36:30.840
They get unintentionally ruined right?

00:36:30.840 --> 00:36:34.520
You bought them for a premium and then you
didn't understand their model.

00:36:34.520 --> 00:36:39.480
But you change a lot of numbers on spreadsheet
that made investment bankers go "Wow."

00:36:39.480 --> 00:36:40.880
Anyway that's a separate issue.

00:36:40.880 --> 00:36:43.120
[laughter]
&gt;&gt;Frances: But I think Southwest Airlines

00:36:43.120 --> 00:36:45.990
is a great one even though it's been talked
about for a long time.

00:36:45.990 --> 00:36:50.370
We talk about Ochsner Health Systems which
is a place in New Orleans that, they have

00:36:50.370 --> 00:36:53.350
it figured out.

00:36:53.350 --> 00:36:56.570
Maybe my favorite example is "Bugs" Burger
Bug Killer.

00:36:56.570 --> 00:36:59.260
[laughter]
&gt;&gt;Lexi: Say that again.

00:36:59.260 --> 00:37:01.960
&gt;&gt;Frances: "Bugs" Burger Bug Killer.

00:37:01.960 --> 00:37:07.610
And it's in an industry where pest control
was what was given to everybody.

00:37:07.610 --> 00:37:10.570
And everyone bought pest control until it
became commoditized.

00:37:10.570 --> 00:37:14.440
And these guys came in and they gave I think
similar to Publix.

00:37:14.440 --> 00:37:18.540
They promised an unconditional guarantee that
we will have pest elimination.

00:37:18.540 --> 00:37:21.370
"We guarantee you'll have no pests."

00:37:21.370 --> 00:37:25.741
And in order to do that, they, and they got
a 700% price premium to do it.

00:37:25.741 --> 00:37:29.160
Because it turned out know what he wanted
you to control their pests they just wanted

00:37:29.160 --> 00:37:32.020
you to eliminate them.

00:37:32.020 --> 00:37:34.960
But to do it.

00:37:34.960 --> 00:37:36.040
I mean if you think about it.

00:37:36.040 --> 00:37:41.030
So when pests, you know this is like, you
know you get like you spray until things stop

00:37:41.030 --> 00:37:42.080
moving right.

00:37:42.080 --> 00:37:44.010
That's like what the job is.

00:37:44.010 --> 00:37:47.570
[laughter]
&gt;&gt;Frances: Employees got six months of training

00:37:47.570 --> 00:37:50.840
as an example.

00:37:50.840 --> 00:37:51.840
Six months of training.

00:37:51.840 --> 00:37:56.330
&gt;&gt;female audience member: Sorry, but I have
a question on the DBC

00:37:56.330 --> 00:37:57.330
&gt;&gt;Gretchen: She's not done.

00:37:57.330 --> 00:37:58.330
&gt;&gt;female audience member: Oh sorry.

00:37:58.330 --> 00:37:59.330
No, that's okay.

00:37:59.330 --> 00:38:00.330
No, but anyway I think we got, you were right,
you felt that moment.

00:38:00.330 --> 00:38:03.910
[laughter]
&gt;&gt;Frances: Please go ahead.

00:38:03.910 --> 00:38:06.090
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:38:06.090 --> 00:38:10.890
&gt;&gt;Lexi: I think I need that so they can access
live.

00:38:10.890 --> 00:38:11.890
&gt;&gt;Frances: Okay, yeah.

00:38:11.890 --> 00:38:16.400
So the way in which they designed the system
was to make sure that they set the employees

00:38:16.400 --> 00:38:17.440
up for success.

00:38:17.440 --> 00:38:21.360
And you couldn't do this job and the culture
and the discretion without having that much

00:38:21.360 --> 00:38:22.390
training.

00:38:22.390 --> 00:38:24.450
And so when I think about what you guys are
doing.

00:38:24.450 --> 00:38:27.770
And you are blessed with having the best and
the brightest wanting to come here.

00:38:27.770 --> 00:38:29.640
And the ones with morality I think it's a
great.

00:38:29.640 --> 00:38:31.100
It's a great word.

00:38:31.100 --> 00:38:36.310
I've never interact with someone who doesn't
casually work really hard.

00:38:36.310 --> 00:38:39.730
But isn't also just in a discretionary way
ready to help everyone else.

00:38:39.730 --> 00:38:41.100
It's lovely.

00:38:41.100 --> 00:38:44.340
And it would be criminal if you burned people
out.

00:38:44.340 --> 00:38:49.480
One of the things we talk about is that if
you're relying on the heroic efforts of individuals,

00:38:49.480 --> 00:38:51.520
it is not sustainable.

00:38:51.520 --> 00:38:54.550
So even if you have heroes today.

00:38:54.550 --> 00:39:00.290
I would design systems where heroics are not
required or it will, we will talk about you

00:39:00.290 --> 00:39:03.670
in retrospect as the company with the great
first decade.

00:39:03.670 --> 00:39:04.670
Yeah.

00:39:04.670 --> 00:39:07.300
&gt;&gt;Gretchen: We're gonna get a question here
and then we're on the VC

00:39:07.300 --> 00:39:12.360
&gt;&gt;male audience member #3: So, would love
your perspective on something we think about

00:39:12.360 --> 00:39:16.160
a lot here which is the trade-off between
scale and service.

00:39:16.160 --> 00:39:21.100
So for example, we have a lot of products
that are in you know 190 countries, 60 languages

00:39:21.100 --> 00:39:25.280
it's a real value to try and get our products
out to as many people as possible.

00:39:25.280 --> 00:39:30.020
And of course that creates conditions where
it's hard to be able to give great service

00:39:30.020 --> 00:39:32.230
across that kind of scale.

00:39:32.230 --> 00:39:35.880
How would you, you know help us to think about
that.

00:39:35.880 --> 00:39:42.170
&gt;&gt;Frances: Yeah so I think the, most growth
is less profitable right?

00:39:42.170 --> 00:39:44.430
So most growth makes you more unprofitable,
Right?

00:39:44.430 --> 00:39:47.590
So the, everyone says they wanna get bigger
'cause they'll get more profitable.

00:39:47.590 --> 00:39:50.910
But if you look at organizations it turns
out not to be true.

00:39:50.910 --> 00:39:52.220
It needn't be that way.

00:39:52.220 --> 00:39:55.300
And here's why it happens.

00:39:55.300 --> 00:39:59.630
If you're doing one thing today the only reason
you should do another thing tomorrow, a different

00:39:59.630 --> 00:40:02.190
thing is if by doing this it makes this better.

00:40:02.190 --> 00:40:04.480
And if by doing this it makes this better.

00:40:04.480 --> 00:40:08.830
So if you scale in a smart way it will become
profitable.

00:40:08.830 --> 00:40:11.910
If you scale, not thinking about that.

00:40:11.910 --> 00:40:16.250
That is if I'm doing this today and I do that
tomorrow and it makes my doing this worse,

00:40:16.250 --> 00:40:19.600
that will be a predictable challenge.

00:40:19.600 --> 00:40:25.040
And so when you think about scale, what I
would say is make sure you're only doing the

00:40:25.040 --> 00:40:28.090
things that make everything else you're doing
better.

00:40:28.090 --> 00:40:31.490
Only grow in a way that makes the core stronger.

00:40:31.490 --> 00:40:35.040
And only do the things in the core that make
the growth part stronger.

00:40:35.040 --> 00:40:39.350
I have no idea what your growth is, but I
bet you're doing some things that are more

00:40:39.350 --> 00:40:42.230
of a sled on the rest of the organization.

00:40:42.230 --> 00:40:48.710
And that is what is tempting because we think
growth is the goal.

00:40:48.710 --> 00:40:52.800
Growth is a magnificent manifestation of doing
everything else right.

00:40:52.800 --> 00:40:54.570
&gt;&gt;male audience member #3: I think the question,
and that's a good point.

00:40:54.570 --> 00:40:58.430
I think the question is a bit of a slightly
different angle on it.

00:40:58.430 --> 00:40:59.430
&gt;&gt;Frances: But that was a great answer though.

00:40:59.430 --> 00:41:00.740
[laughter]
&gt;&gt;male audience member #3: It was a great

00:41:00.740 --> 00:41:01.740
answer.

00:41:01.740 --> 00:41:04.050
It was a great answer aboutâ€”
&gt;&gt;Frances: But it wasn't your question?

00:41:04.050 --> 00:41:10.490
Economies of scope and we have absolutely
do a lot of things that could be considered

00:41:10.490 --> 00:41:11.490
a sled I think.

00:41:11.490 --> 00:41:12.490
&gt;&gt;Frances: Yeah.

00:41:12.490 --> 00:41:15.790
&gt;&gt;male audience member #3: But this is more
about the scale of the volume of people that

00:41:15.790 --> 00:41:16.830
we serve.

00:41:16.830 --> 00:41:19.930
It's actually a core value of Google.

00:41:19.930 --> 00:41:26.490
To not just serve English markets, not just
serve developed markets but to serve all markets.

00:41:26.490 --> 00:41:27.490
As much as possible.

00:41:27.490 --> 00:41:32.020
And that's what I mean by serving tens or
hundreds of millions of people in 190 countries

00:41:32.020 --> 00:41:33.020
in 60 languages.

00:41:33.020 --> 00:41:37.050
&gt;&gt;Frances: So I think it's the same answer,
but I'll phrase is differently.

00:41:37.050 --> 00:41:39.369
[laughter]
&gt;&gt;Frances: No and I mean that genuinely.

00:41:39.369 --> 00:41:42.080
That you're, I love the ambition.

00:41:42.080 --> 00:41:47.310
The ambition of Google is to serve maybe from
what you're saying all people on the planet.

00:41:47.310 --> 00:41:51.040
And what I would say is that if serving a
subset of those people meant serving the rest

00:41:51.040 --> 00:41:55.300
of them had to be worse, would you make that
trade-off?

00:41:55.300 --> 00:41:57.120
And if so, just do it with an open heart.

00:41:57.120 --> 00:41:59.660
In general, because you have a lot of scope.

00:41:59.660 --> 00:42:03.360
Even if it's doing the same thing in different
countries it's doing a different thing.

00:42:03.360 --> 00:42:11.400
So I think it does apply to this that I would
argue that you should prudently only do the,

00:42:11.400 --> 00:42:14.460
only do additional things that make the core
of what you're doing better.

00:42:14.460 --> 00:42:16.710
That's where we want to think really creatively.

00:42:16.710 --> 00:42:20.740
So how can going into this new market or into
these 10 new markets make what I'm doing over

00:42:20.740 --> 00:42:22.170
here better?

00:42:22.170 --> 00:42:24.890
By the way, there's lots of reasons, lots
of ways to do it.

00:42:24.890 --> 00:42:28.500
Lots of innovation that can occur here can
get fueled back and to make this better.

00:42:28.500 --> 00:42:31.000
But that has to be the guiding principle for.

00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:33.200
&gt;&gt;Anne: And to affirm the question.

00:42:33.200 --> 00:42:38.980
[laughter]
&gt;&gt;Anne: I mean this is, that is the interesting

00:42:38.980 --> 00:42:39.980
question.

00:42:39.980 --> 00:42:41.380
It's definitely a bias that shows up in the
book is,

00:42:41.380 --> 00:42:45.470
I mean all of the examples that we go after
are organizations that have figured out how

00:42:45.470 --> 00:42:47.530
to do this on a big scale.

00:42:47.530 --> 00:42:49.810
And that's where it gets really hard.

00:42:49.810 --> 00:42:54.650
You know and there, we spend a chapter just
talking about the growth question, Chapter

00:42:54.650 --> 00:42:55.650
6.

00:42:55.650 --> 00:42:59.650
[laughter]
&gt;&gt;Anne: I never thought I would be this guy.

00:42:59.650 --> 00:43:00.900
But it's a great question.

00:43:00.900 --> 00:43:02.360
&gt;&gt;Frances: It is a great question.

00:43:02.360 --> 00:43:05.260
&gt;&gt;Anne: And it's much harder at a bigger scale
than at a lower scale.

00:43:05.260 --> 00:43:06.260
&gt;&gt;Frances: Yeah.

00:43:06.260 --> 00:43:07.870
I didn't mean to have a, uh, anyway.

00:43:07.870 --> 00:43:10.140
&gt;&gt;Gretchen: It was great, it was great.

00:43:10.140 --> 00:43:11.670
&gt;&gt;male audience member #3: It's a variable.

00:43:11.670 --> 00:43:13.210
&gt;&gt;Frances: Yeah no I get,
&gt;&gt;Gretchen: Alright, you're done now, we're

00:43:13.210 --> 00:43:14.210
on to something else.

00:43:14.210 --> 00:43:15.210
[laughter]
&gt;&gt;male audience member #3: Harvard spirit.

00:43:15.210 --> 00:43:18.730
&gt;&gt;Gretchen: I know.

00:43:18.730 --> 00:43:23.870
We're gonna test our technology now and were
gonna take a question from the VC from Deepak.

00:43:23.870 --> 00:43:24.870
So you should be unmuted.

00:43:24.870 --> 00:43:26.710
&gt;&gt;Deepak: All right, can you hear me?

00:43:26.710 --> 00:43:27.710
&gt;&gt;Gretchen: Yes.

00:43:27.710 --> 00:43:28.710
&gt;&gt;Frances: Awesome.

00:43:28.710 --> 00:43:29.710
&gt;&gt;Deepak: Ah perfect it works.

00:43:29.710 --> 00:43:34.600
All right first off I just wanted to say Frances
and Anne, thank you so much to coming to the

00:43:34.600 --> 00:43:36.390
session today I apologize I can't be there
person.

00:43:36.390 --> 00:43:41.960
For those that know me I joined Google about
two years ago with a little mission of trying

00:43:41.960 --> 00:43:44.910
to make this a world class organization.

00:43:44.910 --> 00:43:48.740
And I actually lead our global customer services
for Google now.

00:43:48.740 --> 00:43:51.050
I just wanted to make one comment.

00:43:51.050 --> 00:43:52.650
I would love your reaction to it.

00:43:52.650 --> 00:43:59.090
Is in your theme around, you have to be bad
at certain areas.

00:43:59.090 --> 00:44:04.680
I firmly believe that you want to pick one
or two areas to be distinctive in.

00:44:04.680 --> 00:44:09.350
So you really want to excel on things such
as customers truly value and they're willing

00:44:09.350 --> 00:44:10.810
to pay for in some sense as well.

00:44:10.810 --> 00:44:12.480
But are truly valuable.

00:44:12.480 --> 00:44:15.180
But I would've used a slightly different word
than bad.

00:44:15.180 --> 00:44:19.790
I would've used there's a minimum threshold
that you need to meet across all these other

00:44:19.790 --> 00:44:20.790
dimensions.

00:44:20.790 --> 00:44:22.430
&gt;&gt;Frances: Yeah
&gt;&gt;Deepak: Because if you truly are bad, it

00:44:22.430 --> 00:44:26.610
actually negatively comes back as a horrible
experience that someone has with you.

00:44:26.610 --> 00:44:30.640
&gt;&gt;Frances: Yeah
&gt;&gt;Deepak: It sounds much better to say bad.

00:44:30.640 --> 00:44:35.950
But in the sense of at least in the work I've
done, there is a minimum threshold.

00:44:35.950 --> 00:44:36.950
&gt;&gt;Frances : Yeah, so.

00:44:36.950 --> 00:44:37.950
Can I?

00:44:37.950 --> 00:44:39.460
&gt;&gt;Deepak: I just wanted to get your commentary
on that.

00:44:39.460 --> 00:44:41.960
&gt;&gt;Lexi: I just wanted to make one thing.

00:44:41.960 --> 00:44:47.050
Deepak is a hero to all service organizations
in that he's brought our service levels with

00:44:47.050 --> 00:44:51.510
FranÃ§oise in the small-medium business space
from 20% to 80%.

00:44:51.510 --> 00:44:53.250
In terms of satisfaction.

00:44:53.250 --> 00:44:57.060
So he would say that's not heroic, he needs
to do more.

00:44:57.060 --> 00:44:58.060
Just so you know.

00:44:58.060 --> 00:45:00.390
&gt;&gt;Frances: Yeah, and here's what I would say.

00:45:00.390 --> 00:45:03.140
In order to be great, you do have to be bad,
and I know it would be better to be average

00:45:03.140 --> 00:45:05.360
on a set of things and above average on another
set.

00:45:05.360 --> 00:45:08.380
It's the world we all want to live in.

00:45:08.380 --> 00:45:11.050
Let me give an example that might make the
trade-off, and I don't even know where to

00:45:11.050 --> 00:45:12.490
look because I don't know where you are.

00:45:12.490 --> 00:45:13.910
So I'm just gonna look in front of me.

00:45:13.910 --> 00:45:17.600
[laughter]
&gt;&gt;Frances: Okay they are.

00:45:17.600 --> 00:45:20.630
So here's an example I would just, I would
offer.

00:45:20.630 --> 00:45:23.360
And then I'll say something about the hygiene
factors.

00:45:23.360 --> 00:45:27.190
What you have to, the minimum order, the minimum
quality you have to be.

00:45:27.190 --> 00:45:33.810
So a health care organization may decide it
wants to compete on access, speed of access.

00:45:33.810 --> 00:45:36.100
So I will see you today.

00:45:36.100 --> 00:45:38.760
Like you get sick, call up and I'll see you
today.

00:45:38.760 --> 00:45:42.710
In order to do that, they will not likely
be able to give you a very high status person.

00:45:42.710 --> 00:45:47.450
It's not to be a world renowned doctor that
you can come in and see on-demand.

00:45:47.450 --> 00:45:52.070
It's a case where access and status trade-off
against each other.

00:45:52.070 --> 00:45:55.790
You want be best in class at access, you're
gonna be worst in class at status.

00:45:55.790 --> 00:46:01.870
If you want be best in class at status, you're
gonna be bad, below average at access.

00:46:01.870 --> 00:46:05.380
Or you could say you know what a charismatic
leader could stand up and say we're gonna

00:46:05.380 --> 00:46:07.810
be best in class at status and access.

00:46:07.810 --> 00:46:10.210
And were gonna push on both.

00:46:10.210 --> 00:46:13.950
And what we have found is that that will lead
to exhausted mediocrity.

00:46:13.950 --> 00:46:18.250
And so I know it doesn't sound right, and
it's not what I would use perhaps to motivate

00:46:18.250 --> 00:46:19.250
the troops.

00:46:19.250 --> 00:46:21.920
But literally, in order to be great, you have
to be bad.

00:46:21.920 --> 00:46:24.520
And understanding where those trade-offs are.

00:46:24.520 --> 00:46:26.260
And they're not shameful trade-offs.

00:46:26.260 --> 00:46:29.780
You know MacBook Air is the lightest weight
computer.

00:46:29.780 --> 00:46:32.780
It traded off on things like ports and memory.

00:46:32.780 --> 00:46:34.010
There's no angst.

00:46:34.010 --> 00:46:37.460
Every year they try to push the frontier but
literally these things trade-off against each

00:46:37.460 --> 00:46:38.460
other.

00:46:38.460 --> 00:46:41.420
And so what our plea is, is to find out where
those trade-offs are.

00:46:41.420 --> 00:46:44.090
So that's the first part, and then very quickly
on the second part.

00:46:44.090 --> 00:46:47.400
There are a set of high, so there's a notion
of hygiene factors.

00:46:47.400 --> 00:46:52.870
That is, if you don't do it a certain level,
you don't get to be in the consideration set.

00:46:52.870 --> 00:46:56.190
So a hypodermic needle is our favorite example
that I think.

00:46:56.190 --> 00:46:59.640
You have to be 99% sterile to be called a
hypodermic needle.

00:46:59.640 --> 00:47:03.330
If you're 98.5% sterile, you're not a hypodermic
needle.

00:47:03.330 --> 00:47:05.160
So you just, that's not good enough.

00:47:05.160 --> 00:47:11.150
But if you're 99.5% and I'm 99.3%, you get
no extra credit for doing it.

00:47:11.150 --> 00:47:13.630
Don't differentiate on hygiene factors.

00:47:13.630 --> 00:47:16.940
Be good enough so you can be in the consideration
set.

00:47:16.940 --> 00:47:20.190
But don't spend the extra part on it.

00:47:20.190 --> 00:47:25.350
&gt;&gt;Anne: And when we talk with audiences that
are filled with engineers, there's nothing

00:47:25.350 --> 00:47:26.920
controversial about this message.

00:47:26.920 --> 00:47:30.260
They can't believe that we're being paid to
be there.

00:47:30.260 --> 00:47:31.260
That we wrote a book.

00:47:31.260 --> 00:47:33.710
[laughter]
&gt;&gt;Anne: I mean like for people who work with

00:47:33.710 --> 00:47:36.330
physics every day, this is intuitive and obvious.

00:47:36.330 --> 00:47:40.160
And I think where we get stuck as a species
is when we think that those rules actually

00:47:40.160 --> 00:47:42.440
don't apply in service organizations.

00:47:42.440 --> 00:47:45.800
&gt;&gt;Gretchen: Okay were gonna take one more
from the VC from Ann Arbor.

00:47:45.800 --> 00:47:47.750
Let's try this, and then we'll go back to
the audience.

00:47:47.750 --> 00:47:50.990
&gt;&gt;male VC speaker: Hi can you hear me?

00:47:50.990 --> 00:47:52.080
&gt;&gt;Gretchen, Frances, Anne: Yes.

00:47:52.080 --> 00:47:53.710
&gt;&gt;male VC speaker: All right, perfect.

00:47:53.710 --> 00:47:58.200
So this actually follows up on the Deepak's
question fairly well so I'm glad he went first.

00:47:58.200 --> 00:48:01.880
But I work on our customer support team for
advertisers on the phone.

00:48:01.880 --> 00:48:06.110
And as our numbers continue to roll in, it
does seem more and more that they're looking

00:48:06.110 --> 00:48:07.950
for perfection from the service that we provide.

00:48:07.950 --> 00:48:11.470
And as you said there is always going to be
a bad involved.

00:48:11.470 --> 00:48:15.860
So how do we help our customers understand
and accept the bad that we're going to be

00:48:15.860 --> 00:48:16.860
offering.

00:48:16.860 --> 00:48:21.420
&gt;&gt;Frances: Yeah, so I think that that's a
great question because customers rarely

00:48:21.420 --> 00:48:26.250
If you ask customers of these 10 things rank
how important they there is no incentive for

00:48:26.250 --> 00:48:28.710
them not to say all 10 are important.

00:48:28.710 --> 00:48:33.770
So the market is what, and what their alternatives
are what help you do that.

00:48:33.770 --> 00:48:36.560
It's not that Southwest Airlines customers
are not hungry.

00:48:36.560 --> 00:48:39.150
[laughter]
&gt;&gt;Frances: It's not that they, I mean if you

00:48:39.150 --> 00:48:42.530
said would you like a meal, customers would
say yes.

00:48:42.530 --> 00:48:47.050
But what they've done is made it clear to
customers that if we provide you a meal we

00:48:47.050 --> 00:48:48.360
have to have catering.

00:48:48.360 --> 00:48:50.910
If we have catering, it'll slow down the turnaround
time.

00:48:50.910 --> 00:48:54.240
If we slow down the turnaround time, we'll
have to have about 100 more planes a year

00:48:54.240 --> 00:48:57.410
and we'll have to raise ticket prices by about
40%.

00:48:57.410 --> 00:49:01.560
So they, if you make the trade-offs clear
we're optimized to be great is this.

00:49:01.560 --> 00:49:03.790
So I can see you same day.

00:49:03.790 --> 00:49:05.890
You'll see a nurse practitioner.

00:49:05.890 --> 00:49:09.770
Or you wanna wait for the best person, you
want to see the best person the world, people

00:49:09.770 --> 00:49:12.060
are likely to wait a month in order to do
that.

00:49:12.060 --> 00:49:18.520
So I think we can get customers to understand
it if we make the, what we're optimizing for

00:49:18.520 --> 00:49:20.000
very clear to them.

00:49:20.000 --> 00:49:25.470
&gt;&gt;Anne: Yeah and Herb Keller is a great example
of someone who you know, you have to sell

00:49:25.470 --> 00:49:26.470
it to your employees.

00:49:26.470 --> 00:49:27.710
You have to make sure everybody gets it.

00:49:27.710 --> 00:49:29.360
And then you have to sell it to your customers.

00:49:29.360 --> 00:49:31.810
And it's absolutely part of the marketing
messaging.

00:49:31.810 --> 00:49:36.050
&gt;&gt;Frances: If you're unapologetic about what
you are bad at, you will get better at it.

00:49:36.050 --> 00:49:38.150
Can't help it.

00:49:38.150 --> 00:49:41.600
And then that's the only reason that's bad
is if it makes what you're distinct at worse.

00:49:41.600 --> 00:49:42.800
&gt;&gt;Anne: And if you're apologetic.

00:49:42.800 --> 00:49:44.000
&gt;&gt;Frances: Yeah, unapologetic, thank you.

00:49:44.000 --> 00:49:48.680
&gt;&gt;male audience member #4: So maybe were gonna
leave you with the wrong impression but I

00:49:48.680 --> 00:49:52.140
want to focus on the bad again.

00:49:52.140 --> 00:49:58.290
So I run the organization that provides support
for local businesses.

00:49:58.290 --> 00:50:01.350
And particularly people that have locations
and you go there.

00:50:01.350 --> 00:50:03.140
And often something's wrong.

00:50:03.140 --> 00:50:06.880
We're really bad about getting everyone's
information right.

00:50:06.880 --> 00:50:08.260
We're terrible at it.

00:50:08.260 --> 00:50:13.360
And that's the one thing as far as I can tell
that's the number one thing the customer values.

00:50:13.360 --> 00:50:15.360
&gt;&gt;Frances: Awesome.

00:50:15.360 --> 00:50:19.470
[laughter]
&gt;&gt;Frances: Like just give like a 20% job to

00:50:19.470 --> 00:50:22.600
somebody in this room, they'll fix it in like
a week.

00:50:22.600 --> 00:50:29.670
[laughter]
&gt;&gt;male audience member #4: We can't.

00:50:29.670 --> 00:50:31.320
&gt;&gt;Frances: You haven't yet.

00:50:31.320 --> 00:50:32.320
As, okay.

00:50:32.320 --> 00:50:35.000
Yes, I've been doing it for about five or
six years.

00:50:35.000 --> 00:50:39.740
So we've been working on the problem sense
the beginnings of Google.

00:50:39.740 --> 00:50:41.040
Right?

00:50:41.040 --> 00:50:47.660
So the question is in the interim of creating
an engineering solution that really truly

00:50:47.660 --> 00:50:54.300
fixes this problem's how you approach the
support team that can't always fix the problem,

00:50:54.300 --> 00:50:57.400
but wants to provide a positive support experience?

00:50:57.400 --> 00:51:01.380
&gt;&gt;Frances: Yeah, so I think, I think that's
the, that's probably going to be the situation

00:51:01.380 --> 00:51:02.380
always right.

00:51:02.380 --> 00:51:05.040
'cause you'll always be going to the next
frontier.

00:51:05.040 --> 00:51:10.010
The first part is I'm inspired by Google that
anything is possible.

00:51:10.010 --> 00:51:13.870
And that if you've been doing something for
five years, coming up with a fresh new way

00:51:13.870 --> 00:51:17.330
to do it, that's not always just by the engineers
making a better product.

00:51:17.330 --> 00:51:22.100
That's why I think that there are,
I suspect that the next generation of Google

00:51:22.100 --> 00:51:25.240
will be as innovative on non-engineering fronts.

00:51:25.240 --> 00:51:28.780
So anyway that's just a side comment there.

00:51:28.780 --> 00:51:33.010
But having people, people thrive in the presence
of constraints.

00:51:33.010 --> 00:51:36.490
We have to just make what the constraints
are clear and then unleashed them.

00:51:36.490 --> 00:51:41.180
So right now, the constraint is we're gonna
give you incomplete information with which

00:51:41.180 --> 00:51:43.780
to serve your customers is what it sounds
like.

00:51:43.780 --> 00:51:47.500
And I'm not, I wouldn't play poker with you.

00:51:47.500 --> 00:51:50.370
The face you're giving me gives nothing back.

00:51:50.370 --> 00:51:52.420
[laughter]
&gt;&gt;Frances: So like is that right?

00:51:52.420 --> 00:51:56.380
&gt;&gt;Gretchen: It's more, we have 90 million
places listed on Google so if you're trying

00:51:56.380 --> 00:51:58.850
to find a place that's what we're talking
about.

00:51:58.850 --> 00:52:01.050
And we get something wrong in that information.

00:52:01.050 --> 00:52:03.190
&gt;&gt;male audience member #4: Incorrect data.

00:52:03.190 --> 00:52:04.190
&gt;&gt;Frances: Yeah.

00:52:04.190 --> 00:52:06.280
&gt;&gt;male audience member #4: About a location,
about your business.

00:52:06.280 --> 00:52:07.280
&gt;&gt;Gretchen: Where it's from, phone number.

00:52:07.280 --> 00:52:08.280
&gt;&gt;Lexi: So you got it right.

00:52:08.280 --> 00:52:14.410
It's you could say engineering is not providing
us the right data they would say, it's impossible

00:52:14.410 --> 00:52:15.450
to map the world.

00:52:15.450 --> 00:52:16.450
But either way.

00:52:16.450 --> 00:52:17.600
&gt;&gt;Frances: And so you haveâ€”
&gt;&gt;male audience member #4: Your cell phone

00:52:17.600 --> 00:52:21.250
is listed as the HBS main phone, right.

00:52:21.250 --> 00:52:22.250
&gt;&gt;Frances: Really.

00:52:22.250 --> 00:52:25.430
&gt;&gt;male audience member #4: You can't get it.

00:52:25.430 --> 00:52:27.890
[laughter]
Those are the kinds of circumstances.

00:52:27.890 --> 00:52:28.890
&gt;&gt;Frances: Yeah, okay.

00:52:28.890 --> 00:52:29.890
Okay.

00:52:29.890 --> 00:52:30.950
You just scared me.

00:52:30.950 --> 00:52:36.660
[laughter]
&gt;&gt;Frances: So now I got it and thank you for

00:52:36.660 --> 00:52:37.660
being patient.

00:52:37.660 --> 00:52:40.590
You're just a role model for me you were more
patient with me then I was with you and I

00:52:40.590 --> 00:52:41.940
still feel badly about that.

00:52:41.940 --> 00:52:44.590
[laughter]
&gt;&gt;Frances: So there's incomplete data.

00:52:44.590 --> 00:52:46.120
So now I'll layer question on top of it.

00:52:46.120 --> 00:52:50.730
&gt;&gt;male audience member #4: So we know we're
not gonna get 100%.

00:52:50.730 --> 00:52:53.600
That's our section of being bad.

00:52:53.600 --> 00:52:56.280
So now we know that we're bad at that.

00:52:56.280 --> 00:52:57.280
Right?

00:52:57.280 --> 00:52:58.280
&gt;&gt;Frances: Yeah.

00:52:58.280 --> 00:52:59.280
&gt;&gt;male audience member #4: We just can't always
fix that.

00:52:59.280 --> 00:53:05.690
So now we know that's bad, we know the customer
values that the most how as a service organization

00:53:05.690 --> 00:53:08.290
do we make them feel better about our brand?

00:53:08.290 --> 00:53:12.090
&gt;&gt;Frances: So yeah I think, and I'm not stipulating
to that's the place where you're gonna be

00:53:12.090 --> 00:53:13.090
bad.

00:53:13.090 --> 00:53:14.380
But anyway.

00:53:14.380 --> 00:53:18.710
The, you have to be, its relative performance.

00:53:18.710 --> 00:53:20.650
You have to be better than the alternatives.

00:53:20.650 --> 00:53:21.650
Right?

00:53:21.650 --> 00:53:25.680
If this is a thing that the customer, so you
want to be best in class.

00:53:25.680 --> 00:53:29.080
You want to be best in class at the things
customers value most.

00:53:29.080 --> 00:53:32.360
And in exchange worse in class at things they
value less.

00:53:32.360 --> 00:53:35.260
So if this really is the competitive dynamic
that they're competing on.

00:53:35.260 --> 00:53:37.090
You have to be best in class.

00:53:37.090 --> 00:53:41.330
So it's not how far are you from perfect,
it's what's the distance between you and the

00:53:41.330 --> 00:53:42.330
alternatives.

00:53:42.330 --> 00:53:44.670
That's the.

00:53:44.670 --> 00:53:46.630
Yeah nothing, you're giving me nothing.

00:53:46.630 --> 00:53:48.100
[laughter]
&gt;&gt;Gretchen: It's him.

00:53:48.100 --> 00:53:50.300
&gt;&gt;male audience member #4: It's me.

00:53:50.300 --> 00:53:54.400
&gt;&gt;Gretchen: Alright so unfortunately we only
have time for one more question Anne and Frances

00:53:54.400 --> 00:53:56.830
will be around a little whileâ€”
&gt;&gt;Frances: We'll stay around as long as you

00:53:56.830 --> 00:53:57.830
like.

00:53:57.830 --> 00:53:58.830
Pit dive as Lexi was saying.

00:53:58.830 --> 00:54:00.920
So we're gonna go to the man with the mike,
last question, close us out.

00:54:00.920 --> 00:54:02.190
&gt;&gt;male audience member #5: Thanks.

00:54:02.190 --> 00:54:05.570
So at Google we have a lot of support channels
for customers to get in touch with us.

00:54:05.570 --> 00:54:08.930
There's self-help like help centers where
they can browse for solutions.

00:54:08.930 --> 00:54:12.810
There's a community which is basically a message
board where users can help other users.

00:54:12.810 --> 00:54:13.810
&gt;&gt;Frances: Awesome
&gt;&gt;Male audience member: We have people who

00:54:13.810 --> 00:54:14.810
jump in there as well.

00:54:14.810 --> 00:54:17.210
&gt;&gt;Frances: Yep.
&gt;&gt;male audience member #5: And we have e-mail

00:54:17.210 --> 00:54:18.210
and phone options.

00:54:18.210 --> 00:54:22.240
A lot of times those e-mail options have auto
responses where they just refer you back to

00:54:22.240 --> 00:54:23.240
the self-help option.

00:54:23.240 --> 00:54:25.890
And then you can e-mail back and maybe you'll
get an answer.

00:54:25.890 --> 00:54:26.890
&gt;&gt;Frances: Yeah.

00:54:26.890 --> 00:54:27.890
&gt;&gt;male audience member #5: But it's a bit
unclear.

00:54:27.890 --> 00:54:32.590
I'd love to hear your opinion and any comments
you have on how best to get in touch with

00:54:32.590 --> 00:54:35.510
and interact with customers in the digital
age where we aren't like a supermarket.

00:54:35.510 --> 00:54:36.510
&gt;&gt;Frances: Yeah.

00:54:36.510 --> 00:54:37.510
Go ahead.

00:54:37.510 --> 00:54:40.790
&gt;&gt;Anne: The I mean, you spoke of something
that we didn't have a chance to talk a lot

00:54:40.790 --> 00:54:44.010
about which is the management training customers
piece.

00:54:44.010 --> 00:54:47.770
And how do you bring customers into the organization
operationally.

00:54:47.770 --> 00:54:50.290
And one way that we see a lot of tech companies.

00:54:50.290 --> 00:54:52.690
And eBay is a good example.

00:54:52.690 --> 00:54:56.740
Of deploying customers to take care of each
other in a very strategic way.

00:54:56.740 --> 00:55:01.820
So I think eBay has done a fantastic job of
creating, not just creating online support

00:55:01.820 --> 00:55:05.730
systems, but creating off-line support systems
and figuring out.

00:55:05.730 --> 00:55:11.000
And it's in the context culturally to where
eBay has outsourced almost every function

00:55:11.000 --> 00:55:12.000
to the customer.

00:55:12.000 --> 00:55:15.480
So customers do merchandising, customers create
the product, they sell it, they support each

00:55:15.480 --> 00:55:16.480
other.

00:55:16.480 --> 00:55:23.200
And I think there's an opportunity there that
a lot of tech companies that grew out of engineering

00:55:23.200 --> 00:55:26.340
companies were they assume that the solution
is always gonna be engineering.

00:55:26.340 --> 00:55:28.560
I think there are some opportunities that
are being missed.

00:55:28.560 --> 00:55:31.480
&gt;&gt;Frances: And so what I would just say is
the guiding principal that we talk about there

00:55:31.480 --> 00:55:35.510
is that you want self-service if that's what
we want the customer doing in the absence

00:55:35.510 --> 00:55:36.710
of employees.

00:55:36.710 --> 00:55:41.570
We want the design imperative for self-service
is that it's preferred by the customer to

00:55:41.570 --> 00:55:45.090
a readily available full-service alternative.

00:55:45.090 --> 00:55:48.570
So think airline kiosk check-in, that really
cool seat map.

00:55:48.570 --> 00:55:52.320
Think airline kiosk check-in not supermarket
checkout.

00:55:52.320 --> 00:55:59.540
Like the only reason we do that is either
were embarrassed by our choices or else, mostly

00:55:59.540 --> 00:56:02.980
we do that because we don't want to wait in
a longer line.

00:56:02.980 --> 00:56:07.180
The airline kiosk check-in is, they design
the self-service so that we prefer it.

00:56:07.180 --> 00:56:14.700
So you want to make the need for full-service
rare not the access to it rare.

00:56:14.700 --> 00:56:17.590
You'll never get there if you make it from
the access rare part.

00:56:17.590 --> 00:56:20.150
You just won't hold yourself to a high enough
imperative.

00:56:20.150 --> 00:56:24.040
&gt;&gt;Anne: And at the scale you're talking about,
there is no way that employees will be able

00:56:24.040 --> 00:56:25.869
to deliver all of, meet all of the service
needs.

00:56:25.869 --> 00:56:31.810
&gt;&gt;Frances: So that's where we wanna unleash
the innate creativity of everyone in the organization.

00:56:31.810 --> 00:56:34.869
And it's not just engineering solutions to
figure out how to do it.

00:56:34.869 --> 00:56:37.610
&gt;&gt;Gretchen: That can be the next title of
your next book, "Unleashed."

00:56:37.610 --> 00:56:38.750
&gt;&gt;Frances: Yeah.

00:56:38.750 --> 00:56:40.450
&gt;&gt;Anne: Mmm good.

00:56:40.450 --> 00:56:41.590
&gt;&gt;Gretchen: Right?

00:56:41.590 --> 00:56:44.630
OK
All right, why don't you guys join me in thanking

00:56:44.630 --> 00:56:45.630
and Anne and Frances.

00:56:45.630 --> 00:56:45.631
[applause]
