00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:04.220
So Nelsmah, let's talk about what context is. When we say context, we mean

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:06.010
the context of the user, who's using

00:00:06.010 --> 00:00:08.240
your application on their Android smart phone.

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:12.640
&gt;&gt; Yeah let's break it down into four things. The first aspect of context

00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:16.720
is, what is your user doing? Are they walking, running? Are they sleeping? Are

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:22.830
they sitting? So the second part of context is, where is the user? This

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:26.410
can be derived from GPS and you can get their latitude and longitude and

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:29.430
there is information about the environmental conditions of where they're at

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:31.800
that has an impact on this as well. So the third

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:36.130
aspect of context is who or what is your user near?

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:38.879
These are things like places that are near by. They're in a

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:42.700
shopping mall, the stores they can visit. Or it's also people

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:45.770
that they're nearby. So you can get this information from their

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:48.380
circles and so on. The last and most obvious part of

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:51.520
context is, who is your user? We can get this information if

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:53.430
your user signed into Google+. We can get their

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:56.300
name, their profile photo, when they were born, all kinds

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:58.190
of things that they put in their profile. And we

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:00.810
can also get who their friends are from their circles.

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:01.990
&gt;&gt; So taking a lot of these aspects

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:05.349
of user context into account. What application have you

00:01:05.349 --> 00:01:07.400
used that got one of these or multiple of

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:09.500
these really right and it totally blew your mind?
