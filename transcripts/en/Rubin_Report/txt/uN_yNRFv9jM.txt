Speaker 1:          00:00          [inaudible] you probably watch, listen to or at the very least heard about Joe Rogan's interview with tech giant Elon Musk from last week. Joe and Alan had a wide ranging discussion for two and a half hours about evolution, technology, market simulation theory and much more immediately after though the headlines were all about the blunt that they smoked in the last 20 minutes along with the very memorable image of Alon with smoke surrounding his head. Shortly after aligns Rogan interview aired two topic Tesla executives resigned and Tesla stock dropped significantly. The usual suspects wrote, think pieces, questioning whether Musk was mentally stable or fit to be an executive at the very company he created. I think the majority of people found the whole ordeal to be kind of funny and Quirky. You know, like a surprising moment that makes life kind of interesting, but apparently these days if you do anything that doesn't conform to group thing, there's a media click machine that'll see blood and is waiting to strike.

Speaker 1:          01:02          Now first off, we'd is totally, completely 100% legal here in California. I'm guessing that you person watching this right now have probably tried it once or twice yourself, maybe even inhaled, but perhaps more importantly than legal issue or whether marijuana has health benefits, impairs your judgment or all of the above lies. A more important question, Alon Musk may be a little nutty, but is unquestionably one of the most important visionaries we have today beyond Tesla, his electric car company, which is revolutionize the automobile industry. He's also the founder and CEO of space x, which is sending rockets beyond Earth's orbit and will most likely make life on Mars a reality within our lifetime. If that's not enough. His ironically named boring company is building tunnels under Los Angeles and an attempt to relieve Las infamously insane traffic. In short, alon isn't just changing the world for the better.

Speaker 1:          02:00          He's creating the reality of a future that most people can only dream of. While the Alon marijuana memes were great, they overshadow the conversation with one of the few modern visionaries we have left. As Tesla employees stepped down or traders worry about Musk's behavior. Perhaps it's just this adventure is attitude, which allows Musk to solve problems. While most people just complain, think the automobile industry is moving on electric cars to slowly create Tesla. Think NASA is in exploring space fast enough, start space x. While we all talk a few people actually do, and for those who do, maybe being different isn't a flaw in the system. It's part of the design. Since when do we live in a time when our geniuses can't have idiosyncratic quirks or act out in ways that make them stand apart from the rest of us are inventors need the room to be different because that different way of thinking is where they find the spark that ignites their genius.

Speaker 1:          02:59          With all this in mind, let's shift to the very company which put a line on the map. He cocreated paypal alongside another misunderstood tech giant Peter Teal Teal. The guy on the left in this picture is an entrepreneur, venture capitalists, philanthropist, author, and my guest on the Rubin report this week. Perhaps even more than MUSC. Teal seems to be misunderstood by the media, which seems more interested in him as a caricature than as a person. Over the last two years, I've become friends with Peter through his friend and my friend and confidant, Eric Weinstein. I know Peter to be an open, decent, thoughtful, curious person. Someone who privately is all of the things that the media says he is not, and that's the person I hope to introduce you to today. Beyond founding paypal, teal was also the first outside investor in Facebook who turned $500,000 into considerably more than that.

Speaker 1:          03:53          He also funded Hulk Hogan's lawsuit, which ultimately toppled Gawker, uh, move many things, was an attack against the media, but I believe to be a seminal moment in defense of the fourth amendment, which defended our right to privacy. Peter has become the ultimate contrarian in the tech world of Silicon Valley, which has become stagnant and dull. When's the last time you were really excited about a new APP for your phone? Remember when there was a new app every day that you just had to have? Those days seem to be long gone and Peter sees a reason for it. He has long talked about the dangers of group think and Foad diversity to have the idea destroying forces which have taken over the tech world. That's exactly why his recent move from Silicon Valley to Los Angeles has happened. Yeah, that's right. La is suddenly becoming a home of free thought thanks to the creatively crushing progressive orthodoxy that has taken over Silicon Valley.

Speaker 1:          04:51          We live in strange times. Indeed. Peter was also the person with the highest profile in the tech world to support Donald Trump for president and even spoke at the Republican National Convention when he told a room full of Republicans that he was proud to be gay. He received a thunderous round of applause and I remember thinking how that moment was a powerful shift in the democratic lock on Gay Americans and the beginning of a new, perhaps more tolerant Republican party deal. I had no idea if he was going to get booed or cheered at that moment, but I believe that the new libertarian view the Republican party has taken on marriage equality is in large part because Peter Dare to stand up for what he believed in, even if it was against conservative orthodoxy with so much in flux in the world right now, people like Alon and Peter have more of a chance to shape the future than ever before. As old institutions continue to crumble, we need new visionaries to build us the institutions of the future. If they're quirky or misunderstood, then they're probably exactly the people we need to get the job done.
