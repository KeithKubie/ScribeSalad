[MUSICAL TONE]

00:00:03.021 --> 00:00:05.020
So the thing I love most
about being a developer

00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:07.510
is that I get to actually
solve real-world problems.

00:00:07.510 --> 00:00:09.760
And I can do it without,
kind of, any special tooling.

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:12.647
So I can just open up a text
editor, like put my code in,

00:00:12.647 --> 00:00:14.980
and then start to actually
see the problem kind of being

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:16.530
solved in from of me as I go.

00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:17.850
And then the great
thing about after that

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:19.360
is that once I've
solved my problem,

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:21.230
I can just deploy it to the web,
give it to anyone that I want.

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:23.230
And they can click a link
and start to use that.
