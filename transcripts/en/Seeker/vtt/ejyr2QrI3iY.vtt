00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:04.290
Sleeping in space is tough, but developing
an addiction to sleep aids?

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:13.270
That would be bad in space too.

00:00:13.270 --> 00:00:14.270
Howdy friends!

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:16.180
Trace again here for DNews.

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:19.289
Sleeping in space is difficulty level, advanced.

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:24.090
The ISS is constantly humming with the noise
of condensers, fans, air filters, and other

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:28.920
equipment -- the sun rises and sets every
90 minutes as the football-field-sized craft

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:33.680
falls around the planet causing weightlessness,
and there's no up or down, so laying on a

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:36.300
comfy mattress is definitely out.

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:39.730
There's not even a 24-hour clock to set an
alarm to!

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:43.719
Astronauts can be on the ISS for weeks or
months, and some crewmembers don masks or

00:00:43.719 --> 00:00:46.180
earplugs to help them get forty winks.

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:50.539
Eventually, most learn to tune out all these
distractions, but many astronauts resort to

00:00:50.539 --> 00:00:53.700
taking sleeping pills to get through their
mission.

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:58.399
New research in Lancet Neurology, studied
sleep deprivation in 85 astronauts on the

00:00:58.399 --> 00:00:59.730
ISS and space shuttle.

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:03.930
They found, in-flight, Earth's explorers don't
get too much beauty sleep on their own, and

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:07.170
instead are popping all sorts of z-drugs [a]to
catch some shut-eye.

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:12.180
As you might recall from an older DNews piece,
sleeping pills don't help you sleep as much

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:13.360
as they sedate you.

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:17.009
Which can cause all sorts of mental compromises
and physical effects.

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:21.930
Space sleep meds have been provided to astronauts
since the Mercury missions in the early 1960s.

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:27.540
Being launched into a completely alien, high-stress
environment does have some negative effect

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.920
on the sleep cycle.

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:34.650
Mission control provides 8-and-a-half hours
a day for every astronaut to sleep, but according

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:39.619
to the Canadian Space Agency, most are only
able to get a six hour siesta.

00:01:39.619 --> 00:01:43.450
Astronauts can sleep in ANY module, provided
they're tied to the wallâ€¦ we don't want

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:45.950
a sleeping astronaut floating around.

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:50.070
Crew on the ISS use sleeping bags, and some
of the pics are kind of funny[b].

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:54.750
But the Lancet Neurology says they're taking
pills 73-percent of the nights studied, and

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:55.909
that's no laughing matter.

00:01:55.909 --> 00:02:00.850
The pills they're taking are reportedly prescribed
to treat insomnia and anxiety, or even brain

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:02.430
disorders and muscle tension.

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:07.000
On the ground, users of these hypnotic drugs
have experienced amnesia and anxiety, even

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.039
behaviors like sleep-driving.

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:13.050
Most astronauts say they take medications
because of the distractions, discomfort with

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:16.560
weightless sleep, or simply that it's too
warm or cold.

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:21.870
But a drowsy astronaut can also self-medicate
with caffeine, which introduces a cycle of

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:25.910
uppers and downers -- as caffeine has a half-life
of three to seven hours.

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:30.950
This can cause more problems with sleep schedules
and the need to pop a sleep aid only a few

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:31.980
hours later.

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:35.599
Of course, chronic sleep deprivation isn't
good either.

00:02:35.599 --> 00:02:40.720
It can cause false memory formation, increased
stress, decreased alertness, risk of mistakes,

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:45.069
injury and long-term health problems like
high blood pressure, stroke, obesity, heart

00:02:45.069 --> 00:02:46.180
failure and depression.

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:51.390
It's a mission priority to keep astronauts
healthy and safe, so the drugs they're taking,

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:53.770
and their vital signs are being monitored.

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:59.170
These humans are living on the edge, and studies
like these reveal the heavy toll it can take

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:00.450
on the body.

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:04.330
As NASA plans for a long-duration space mission
to Mars, they're highly focused on making

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:11.000
the experience safe for the body and the mind
-- and that includes learning about how astronaut

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:12.000
slumber parties.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:13.180
How would you solve this problem?

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:14.180
More pills?

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:15.250
More on-the-ground sleep training?

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:16.810
More free time to nap or doze?

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:17.810
What do you think?

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:21.640
We've got that empty box below, so get down
there and fill it up with your thoughts.

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:25.930
