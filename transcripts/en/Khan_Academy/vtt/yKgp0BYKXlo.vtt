00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.396
- Let's now see if we
can tackle the questions.

00:00:03.206 --> 00:00:06.390
The passage most strongly
suggests that researchers

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:08.705
at the Martin Prosperity Institute

00:00:08.705 --> 00:00:10.124
share which assumption?

00:00:10.359 --> 00:00:13.177
We saw the writer, he works for the Martin

00:00:13.177 --> 00:00:14.251
Prosperity Institute.

00:00:14.691 --> 00:00:18.315
And he's trying to quantify
how much cost there

00:00:18.315 --> 00:00:20.242
is involved when people having to commute

00:00:20.242 --> 00:00:21.356
every minute of cost.

00:00:22.526 --> 00:00:24.076
Employees who work from home are

00:00:24.076 --> 00:00:26.152
are more valuable to their employers

00:00:26.152 --> 00:00:27.045
than employees that commute.

00:00:27.045 --> 00:00:27.963
No, he's not saying that.

00:00:27.963 --> 00:00:30.355
He's just saying, when
you commute, regardless

00:00:30.355 --> 00:00:32.235
how valuable you are to
employer, you're just

00:00:32.235 --> 00:00:34.279
wasting time, having stress, etcetera.

00:00:34.279 --> 00:00:37.576
Employees whose commutes are shortened,

00:00:37.576 --> 00:00:40.896
will use the time saved to
do additional, productive

00:00:40.896 --> 00:00:42.939
work for their employers.

00:00:43.289 --> 00:00:44.681
Ah, maybe.

00:00:45.181 --> 00:00:47.497
Arguably, they could have used that time

00:00:47.507 --> 00:00:49.434
to take a vacation,
have a break, de-stress.

00:00:49.434 --> 00:00:51.003
They don't say this directly.

00:00:51.003 --> 00:00:52.652
I mean this is interesting.

00:00:52.652 --> 00:00:53.673
Let's read the other choices.

00:00:53.673 --> 00:00:56.483
Employees can conduct business activities

00:00:56.483 --> 00:00:58.247
such as composing memos or joining

00:00:58.247 --> 00:00:59.687
conference calls while commutting.

00:01:00.567 --> 00:01:02.561
I didn't get any sense that
they want people to work

00:01:02.561 --> 00:01:03.906
while they're driving.

00:01:04.156 --> 00:01:06.081
Employees who have lengthy commutes tend

00:01:06.081 --> 00:01:07.938
to make more money than
employees that have

00:01:07.938 --> 00:01:08.728
shorter commutes.

00:01:08.728 --> 00:01:09.773
So they never made that argument.

00:01:10.383 --> 00:01:11.560
So out of all these,

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:13.570
this one seems to be the best,

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:16.872
Employees whose commutes are shortened

00:01:16.872 --> 00:01:19.612
will use their time saved
to do additional, productive

00:01:19.612 --> 00:01:20.447
work for their employers.

00:01:20.447 --> 00:01:22.444
And I'm a little bit on the fence of this

00:01:22.444 --> 00:01:25.486
because they quantified
the number of hours

00:01:25.486 --> 00:01:27.483
and they said if people work those hours,

00:01:27.483 --> 00:01:29.642
that would be the value to the economy.

00:01:29.642 --> 00:01:32.978
But they're not saying that
that would convert directly

00:01:32.978 --> 00:01:34.727
to additional productive work.

00:01:34.727 --> 00:01:37.374
It could be time for the
person to recharge, etcetera

00:01:37.374 --> 00:01:39.845
It didn't into a lot of
detail with what the person

00:01:39.845 --> 00:01:41.834
would do with that
time, it just quantified

00:01:41.834 --> 00:01:45.340
that time in terms of lost work time.

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:47.709
But out of all of them,
I'll go with this one.

00:01:49.209 --> 00:01:53.193
As used in line 51,
intense most nearly means,

00:01:53.623 --> 00:01:55.557
Let's read line 51.

00:01:57.953 --> 00:02:01.001
The coming decades will
likely see more intense

00:02:01.001 --> 00:02:03.764
clustering of jobs,
innovations and productivity,

00:02:03.764 --> 00:02:06.736
and a smaller number of
bigger city and city regions.

00:02:09.286 --> 00:02:10.881
The clustering of jobs, they're talking

00:02:10.881 --> 00:02:12.869
about a higher concentration
of things happening.

00:02:12.869 --> 00:02:15.902
so, this is not talking about an emotional

00:02:15.922 --> 00:02:16.789
clustering of jobs,

00:02:16.789 --> 00:02:18.702
it's talking about a
concentrated clustering of jobs.

00:02:18.702 --> 00:02:20.578
They're not saying a
brilliant or determined

00:02:20.578 --> 00:02:22.226
clustering of jobs either.

00:02:23.366 --> 00:02:25.010
For these you can literally
just replace the word

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:25.846
and see how it sounds.

00:02:27.216 --> 00:02:28.980
And see if it changes the
meaning of what they were

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:30.629
trying to talk about.

00:02:32.119 --> 00:02:33.334
Alright.

00:02:34.311 --> 00:02:35.513
The next one.

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:39.344
Which claim about traffic congestion

00:02:39.344 --> 00:02:41.730
is supported by the graph?

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:45.241
A. New York city commuters spend less time

00:02:45.241 --> 00:02:47.679
annually delayed by
traffic congestions than

00:02:47.679 --> 00:02:49.885
the average for very large cities.

00:02:50.795 --> 00:02:52.746
No, that's not true, New
York spends more than

00:02:52.746 --> 00:02:54.751
the average for very large ciites.

00:02:55.751 --> 00:02:57.664
Los Angeles commuters
are delayed more hours

00:02:57.664 --> 00:03:00.543
annually than traffic congestion, than are

00:03:00.543 --> 00:03:02.656
commuters in Washington D.C.

00:03:06.616 --> 00:03:09.655
No, they are not, D.C. is
the top right over here.

00:03:10.287 --> 00:03:12.098
Commuters in Washington D.C. face greater

00:03:12.098 --> 00:03:14.072
delays annually due to traffic congestion

00:03:14.072 --> 00:03:15.813
than do commuters in New York City.

00:03:15.813 --> 00:03:18.437
Yep, we see that in
Washington D.C. has the most

00:03:18.437 --> 00:03:20.039
delays annually.

00:03:20.039 --> 00:03:21.270
So I would go with that.

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:24.412
Commuters in Detroit
spend more time delayed

00:03:24.412 --> 00:03:27.144
annually by traffic
congestion than do commuters

00:03:27.144 --> 00:03:28.305
in Houston, Altanta, Chicago.

00:03:30.085 --> 00:03:32.006
Detroit's near the bottom
of at least this list.

00:03:32.006 --> 00:03:36.255
It actually has less delay
than Atlanta, Chicago

00:03:36.255 --> 00:03:37.765
and Houston.
