00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:04.420
When I was a kid, we got a new twisty tube-slide
at the elementary school.

00:00:04.420 --> 00:00:07.500
Kids liked to clog it up on purpose, with
the kid at the bottom stopping and holding

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:09.930
everyone else in the pipe.

00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:14.060
Some kids thought it was a riot, but I felt
trapped and immediately had a sense of dread.

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:17.939
I screamed, the kids unclogged, and I was
instantly uncool.

00:00:17.939 --> 00:00:19.310
Was that claustrophobia?

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:26.519
Or something else?

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:33.540
In 1879, physician Dr. Benjamin Ball observed
two patients in Paris who, curiously, couldn't

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:38.020
stay in their apartment with the doors closed
without anxiety, and a third who was climbing

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:42.030
Saint-Jacques Tower, and felt an overwhelming
urge to flee.

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:45.380
She ran to the exit, "dashing her head" in
the process.

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:48.510
Apparently, the urge immediately vanished
upon reaching the open air.

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:54.170
Ball dubbed this bizarre feeling "claustrophobia,"
and the 1881 American Journal of Insanity

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:59.820
called it "a special form of delirium, characterized
by a 'fear of closed spaces;'" today they

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:03.300
include narrow spaces with enclosed ones.

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:07.649
The list of spaces is long, including subways,
elevators, rooms without windows, public bathrooms,

00:01:07.649 --> 00:01:10.399
tunnels, cars, hotel rooms, planes and so
on.

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:14.299
And even THINKING about it can trigger an
attack… sorry.

00:01:14.299 --> 00:01:18.069
Most people who live with it don't get it
formally diagnosed, because there's no need

00:01:18.069 --> 00:01:24.700
to do so, their own fear causes those affected
to spend much of their lives avoiding trigger

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:25.700
spaces.

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:29.979
The National Health Service in the UK says
10-percent of the population is affected by

00:01:29.979 --> 00:01:34.130
claustrophobia, though studies find only about
four percent will suffer from full-blown attacks.

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:39.520
I call it an attack, because psychologists
and psychiatrists connect it to anxiety disorders,

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:41.709
believing it's essentially a short-lived panic
attack.

00:01:41.709 --> 00:01:44.020
It might be caused by some kind of childhood
trauma.

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:48.659
For example, losing one's parents in a crowded
place, getting stuck in a hole (or a slide?)...

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:53.219
it's really hard to say.

00:01:53.219 --> 00:01:57.139
Since the late 19th century, researchers have
been digging into this crazy fear, and found

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:58.719
very little solid ground.

00:01:58.719 --> 00:02:03.439
A 2007 study in the Journal of Magnetic Resonance
Imaging found women were far more likely than

00:02:03.439 --> 00:02:08.190
men to experience claustrophobia, and a study
in the journal Cognition in 2011, found it

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:12.440
may have to do with the invisible bubble of
"personal space" we all project around us.

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:17.100
Most people's personal space extends only
as far as we can reach, but people with claustrophobia

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:20.640
may be projecting their personal space beyond
their reach!

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:26.640
Thus, when someone violates that territorial
bubble, the person experiences a panic attack!

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:30.880
Researchers think this disorder may have a
connection to acrophobia, or a fear of heights;

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:36.070
as people with claustrophobia seem to underestimate
horizontal distances the way acrophobics do

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:37.700
with vertical ones.

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:40.700
Essentially, they believe the room is smaller
than it really is.

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:45.060
This study is about as far as we've come to
understanding the disorder.

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:48.700
Perhaps it's a defense mechanism, and some
are simply more sensitive to it…

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:51.180
There does seem to be a genetic component
as well.

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:59.080
A 2013 study in Translational Psychiatry found
a single mutation on gene Gpm6a causes "claustrophobia-like"

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:00.190
behavior in mice.

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:05.580
Plus, a study in Psychiatry and Clinical Neurosciences
found people with panic disorders had significantly

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:09.120
smaller amygdalae: the section of the brain
that processes fear!

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:15.930
In the end, they're still trying to figure
out WHY some people experience claustrophobia.

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:19.510
As with most anxiety disorders, there's no
true "cure."

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:24.150
Symptoms can be managed, but if the phobia
is severe, specialists will recommend exposure

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:28.510
therapy -- where the claustrophobic person
would be walked through imagining, and then

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:33.420
experiencing the things that cause the fear
until they, essentially, get over it.

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:38.100
It's rough, but so far, is the best we have.

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:45.520
More research is, for sure, needed.

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:50.570
What do you think?

00:03:50.570 --> 00:04:22.840
Have 
you experienced claustrophobia?
