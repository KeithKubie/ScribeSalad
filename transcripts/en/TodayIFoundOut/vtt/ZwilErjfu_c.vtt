00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:02.689
The Story Behind the Legend

00:00:02.689 --> 00:00:07.010
The Legend of Zelda is aptly named, as the
series has truly become a legend within the

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:08.280
gaming industry.

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:12.309
Every new generation of gamers have been given
the opportunity to fall in love with it through

00:00:12.309 --> 00:00:14.400
their current Nintendo console.

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:17.580
Or if they’re purists, going back to the
original NES game.

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:21.750
However, the fundamentals have pretty much
always remained – a boy in green whose quest

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:24.250
is to stop an evil wizard and save the princess.

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:26.360
You don’t mess with perfection.

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:30.400
The question is- where did the inspiration
for the Legend of Zelda come from?

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:35.030
What inspired Nintendo to create a series
that would subsequently exhilarate millions

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:40.110
of gamers worldwide, many of whom would engage
in a lifelong love affair with the franchise?

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:43.710
This may sound familiar, but it really did
all start with a young boy…

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:47.660
His name was Shigeru Miyamoto, and if you’re
a seasoned gaming fan you more than likely

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:49.239
recognize the name.

00:00:49.239 --> 00:00:53.460
If not, he’s the guy responsible for a couple
of small indie franchises you’ve probably

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:58.810
never heard of- Super Mario Bros, Donkey Kong,
F-Zero and Star Fox…

00:00:58.810 --> 00:01:00.260
Yep, one guy.

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:04.180
It’s not surprising from this that he’s
known as the “father of modern gaming”.

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:09.080
He is also responsible for this gem of a quote:
“Video games are bad for you?

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:10.930
That’s what they said about rock and roll.”

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:15.250
In addition to the aforementioned series that
he has under his belt, Miyamoto is also the

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:17.810
principal creator of the Legend of Zelda.

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:20.680
And I wasn’t joking when I said that his
journey towards one of the greatest gaming

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:23.840
series of all time began when he was a boy.

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:28.180
Miyamoto himself has stated that his primary
inspiration for the character and the game

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:32.340
flow was derived from his explorations of
the hillsides surrounding his childhood town

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.020
of Sonobe, Japan.

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:38.370
Much like Link himself, Miyamoto would adventure
through the forests, caves, lakes and small

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:39.370
villages.

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:41.850
As he said,
“When I was a child, I went hiking and found

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:42.850
a lake.

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:44.720
It was quite a surprise for me to stumble
upon it.

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:48.130
When I traveled around the country without
a map, trying to find my way, stumbling on

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:52.890
amazing things as I went, I realized how it
felt to go on an adventure like this.”

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:56.540
Yet another memorable moment of adventure
for Miyamoto was when he discovered a cave

00:01:56.540 --> 00:02:00.450
entrance and explored its interior with the
aid of a single lantern.

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:04.220
There presumably wasn’t an old man inside
handing out wooden swords.

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:08.310
As for the titular name, it was derived from
none other than the great Zelda Fitzgerald.

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:13.230
For those of you unfamiliar, she was the extremely
free-spirited and highly publicized (in her

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:18.060
day) wife of literary legend F. Scott Fitzgerald,
creator of The Great Gatsby, among a myriad

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:19.310
of other works.

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:21.870
So why did Miyamoto choose this name for his
princess?

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:24.760
Apparently he thought it sounded “pleasant”
and “significant.”

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:26.360
But what about Link?

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:30.530
Well, his depiction was inspired by Peter
Pan – the other green clad boy that never

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:31.750
seems to grow up.

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:34.290
Miyamoto said he wanted his protagonist to
be recognizable.

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:39.120
And what better way to do that than to use
a similar depiction to arguably the most well-known

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:41.480
boy in children’s entertainment?

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:45.870
As for the name, that came from the series
taking place in the past, present and future,

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:48.450
with the main character being the “link”
between them.

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:53.440
So there you have it, it started with an adventuresome
boy who loved exploring, who then became a

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:58.270
man who created a game about a boy who in
the process of exploring has adventures.

00:02:58.270 --> 00:02:59.410
Seems to have worked out.

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:03.440
To date, depending on what source you want
to go with, the Zelda franchise has sold somewhere

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:08.180
between 70-80 million copies of the various
games in the franchise.

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:11.209
Bonus Facts:
• Zelda Fitzgerald was quite the remarkable

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:13.880
women in her own right, dubbed “the first
flapper”.

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:18.270
Her father’s position as the Chief Justice
of the Alabama Supreme Court protected her

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:22.110
somewhat, but also got her into the news quite
a bit when she was young for her “unladylike”

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:27.150
antics, such as wearing a skin-tight flesh
coloured bathing suit so it would be reported

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:28.659
that she swam in the nude.

00:03:28.659 --> 00:03:32.130
As a sort of a snapshot into her philosophy
on life, it was essentially “girls just

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:36.520
wanna have fun”, but literally, according
to her high-school graduation photo, was:

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:39.190
“Why should all life be work, when we all
can borrow.

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:41.630
Let’s think only of today, and not worry
about tomorrow.”

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:46.090
That was pretty much her life in a nutshell,
only she never really needed to do the borrowing

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:47.090
part.

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:50.989
For instance, as an adult, Zelda was once
asked for her favorite recipe to cook to add

00:03:50.989 --> 00:03:54.220
to Harper &amp; Brothers Favorite Recipes of Famous
Women.

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:58.019
Not being the domestic type, she responded
with: “See if there is any bacon, and if

00:03:58.019 --> 00:04:00.420
there is, ask the cook which pan to fry it
in.

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:04.310
Then ask if there are any eggs, and if so
try and persuade the cook to poach two of

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:05.310
them.

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:07.890
It is better not to attempt toast, as it burns
very easily.

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:11.920
Also, in the case of bacon, do not turn the
fire too high, or you will have to get out

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:13.330
of the house for a week.

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:17.129
Serve preferably on china plates, though gold
or wood will do if handy.”

00:04:17.129 --> 00:04:22.550
• Zelda wasn’t originally too keen on
marrying F. Scott Fitzgerald, as she didn’t

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:26.660
like his prospects, so she continued allowing
others to court her while he went to seek

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:28.300
his fortunes as a writer.

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:32.860
F. Scott, however, was enamored with her and
was driven to succeed quickly before she accepted

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:35.199
someone else’ proposal for marriage.

00:04:35.199 --> 00:04:39.330
Towards this end, besides his article writing,
he began working on his first book, This Side

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:43.499
of Paradise . After it was accepted to be
published, F. Scott wrote the publisher stating

00:04:43.499 --> 00:04:47.889
that he would like the book to be published
as quickly as possible as “I have so many

00:04:47.889 --> 00:04:51.369
things dependent on its success—including
of course a girl.”

00:04:51.369 --> 00:04:55.180
It worked; after he sent a message to Zelda
telling her that he had a book about to be

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:59.430
published, she immediately accepted his proposal
for marriage and moved to New York to live

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:01.759
with him.

00:05:01.759 --> 00:05:05.689
• Before signing on with Nintendo, Miyamoto
had originally intended to become a manga

00:05:05.689 --> 00:05:07.999
artist.

00:05:07.999 --> 00:05:11.319
• In the early going, the brass at Nintendo
weren’t too happy with the approach for

00:05:11.319 --> 00:05:15.039
the gameplay of Zelda- where players more
or less simply explore without much in the

00:05:15.039 --> 00:05:19.539
way of real hints as to what they’re supposed
to be doing other than assemble the triforce.

00:05:19.539 --> 00:05:23.819
And, indeed, test groups who played the initial
game tended to get confused as to what to

00:05:23.819 --> 00:05:24.819
do.

00:05:24.819 --> 00:05:28.499
Miyamoto argued, and eventually convinced
the executives, that the game’s underlying

00:05:28.499 --> 00:05:32.210
premise of just exploring and seeing what
there was to see in the world created didn’t

00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:33.499
need to be changed.

00:05:33.499 --> 00:05:47.479
Turns out, he was right.
