the way they don't know what it is we
 

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:50.080
the way they don't know what it is we
only ever learn what our risk tolerance

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:50.090
only ever learn what our risk tolerance

you know what I'm gonna think about that

00:01:56.650 --> 00:01:56.660
you know what I'm gonna think about that
 

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:59.080
you know what I'm gonna think about that
let me think about that and I'll get

00:01:59.080 --> 00:01:59.090
let me think about that and I'll get
 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:01.930

people don't have the wherewithal to
answer instead we said ok let us learn

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:11.750
answer instead we said ok let us learn
 

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:14.530
answer instead we said ok let us learn
about you through the taking you through

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:14.540
about you through the taking you through
 

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:15.040

and the capability tell us what your
 

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:19.330
and the capability tell us what your
goals are and then we'll tell you

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:19.340
goals are and then we'll tell you
 

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:21.100
goals are and then we'll tell you
essentially how much much risk you can

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:21.110
essentially how much much risk you can
 

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:23.710
essentially how much much risk you can
afford so for an example you and I are

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:23.720
afford so for an example you and I are
 

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:25.780

don't get a lot of risk I get plenty of
 

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:49.900
don't get a lot of risk I get plenty of
risk and so we tweaked things like that

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:49.910
risk and so we tweaked things like that
 

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:52.420
risk and so we tweaked things like that
as well as really making it so making it

and then the most important change we

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:03.140
and then the most important change we
 

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:07.270
and then the most important change we
found is that most people think of and

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:07.280
found is that most people think of and
 

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:09.610

what we found may be a subtle point as

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:12.440
what we found may be a subtle point as
 

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:15.970
what we found may be a subtle point as
women are risk aware investors and what

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:15.980
women are risk aware investors and what
 

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:18.460

me in standard deviation and let's

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:19.850
me in standard deviation and let's
 

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:21.370
me in standard deviation and let's
really go through that statistical

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:21.380
really go through that statistical
 

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:25.449
really go through that statistical
analysis but more hold on how bad can it

00:03:25.449 --> 00:03:25.459
analysis but more hold on how bad can it
 

00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:28.600
analysis but more hold on how bad can it
get and so what we do is we track you

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:28.610
