00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:09.610
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: Welcome everybody to another
Authors@Google talk. Today we have as our

00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:15.600
guest at Google, Professor David Deamer, from
the Department of Biomolecular Engineering

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:21.840
at the University of California. He's going
to talk about the evolution of very early

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:29.150
life and his book, which just came out in
print, is called "First Life." So, please

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:33.200
welcome David Deamer. Thank you.

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:34.200
[applause]

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:39.399
&gt;&gt;David Deamer: Well, thank you all for coming.
It is really a treat and a pleasure. I gave

00:00:39.399 --> 00:00:44.980
a Tech Talk here last year. But my pleasure
here today is reading my first love, which

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:50.819
is how did life begin and how did life begin
to evolve. So, we're making a lot of progress.

00:00:50.819 --> 00:00:57.710
And you're gonna hear about that today. You're
also gonna hear a little bit of history about

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:03.079
how my own research career got started and
how its progressed through the last about

00:01:03.079 --> 00:01:08.190
30 years, believe it or not, and how it finally
culminated in this little book that came out

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:09.820
earlier this month.

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:15.570
So, this is an Author's Talk and we're supposed
to do little readings out of our book. But

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:20.190
that's boring just to hear readings. I'm gonna
do a couple of short paragraphs here and there

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:29.909
to illustrate as we go on. So, "First Life."
That is the book company's USC Ppress title.

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:34.700
I thought it was pretty good. We played with
a lot of titles and that was the one that

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:39.659
really came out. I later discovered that this
was also of David Attenborough's television

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:45.429
series. So, that's just the luck of the draw.
So, "First Life" and what you're gonna hear

00:01:45.429 --> 00:01:53.049
about from me today is that life, at least
at its beginning and still today, depends

00:01:53.049 --> 00:01:56.270
on what is called self-assembly processes.

00:01:56.270 --> 00:02:04.729
Now what you're seeing up there in that little
image to the right is a bit of dried phospholipid.

00:02:04.729 --> 00:02:10.791
And when phospholipid interacts with water,
it self-assembles into membranous structures.

00:02:10.791 --> 00:02:16.600
So as part of my talk, I'm gonna take you
back 40 years in time to the person who discovered

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:21.330
this and how I spent some time with him and
began to work on this project.

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:29.110
So, it's not just this book that came out,
which is a lay-person's version. It's readable,

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:34.830
I hope. There's also technical version that
came out last year. Jack Szostak and I got

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:41.180
together with the Cool Springs Harbor Press.
And this is 20 chapters from a variety of

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:47.500
authors, including Jack and myself, giving
a very up-to-date vision of how life could

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:52.830
have begun right from the start in fact, as
Earth became a planet.

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:57.480
So, those are the things that have, that you're
gonna hear a bit about today. And I'm gonna

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:03.721
start by reminding you of this saying. Most
of you know the acronym. It's "keep it simple,

00:03:03.721 --> 00:03:09.720
stupid." Leaving out the stupid, this is what
we tell our students in our laboratories.

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:16.530
Keep it simple. And what that means is it
comes out of a reductionistic philosophy that

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:22.440
scientists use to try to, literally, keep
it simple, to keep things under control. But

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:29.250
I have another little acronym that I pass
along after I get that across. B-N-T-S. And

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:31.940
that stands for: But not that simple.

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:33.000
[laughter]

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:37.420
Because we have been limited. We are limiting
ourselves when we think about the origin of

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:42.560
life by doing little baby steps. You know,
this molecule, that molecule. How do they

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:45.490
link together to make a little dimer of some
sorts?

00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:51.410
So these are baby steps. I think the point
of my book is let's look at a bigger picture

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:59.790
and try to get something sufficiently complex.
Well, sufficiently complex. What do I mean

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:06.300
by that? Some of you may recognize Stanley
Miller's experiment that was published about

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:11.310
1953, however many years ago that is--half
a century--to round off.

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:17.570
And what Stanley did was to put together a
sufficiently complex simulation of the early

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:22.400
Earth. And this is how we learn about the
origin of life. We try to simulate something

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:27.510
in the laboratory, keeping it simple, and
try to learn from a simulation that tests

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:29.320
a hypothesis.

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:38.490
So, Stanley's hypothesis was that if you had
four gases--water, ammonia, methane, and ammonia--those

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:42.400
four gases, the four biogenic before biotrenic
elements, and if you put in some energy as

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:47.500
a spark, an electrical discharge there, that
that would be sufficiently complex to make

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:49.240
something interesting.

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:54.450
Those are the four molecules, very simple
gas molecules, including boiling water down

00:04:54.450 --> 00:05:01.990
there in the bottom left. And he then sparked
it for a day and for a week. And he had this

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:07.370
spark discharge going and it began to turn
a light-yellow color, and then an orange color,

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:10.710
and then a red color, and then a brownish
color about a week later.

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:17.170
And the sides of the flask became coated with
a product of this reaction. Amazingly, there

00:05:17.170 --> 00:05:24.050
were hundreds of products produced from this
simple reaction, including amino acids. And

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:29.420
that's what caught people's eyes because amino
acids are the monomers of all life on the

00:05:29.420 --> 00:05:30.420
Earth.

00:05:30.420 --> 00:05:35.510
They're used to make proteins. Smaller proteins
are called peptides. And the bond that holds

00:05:35.510 --> 00:05:38.520
them together is called the peptide bond,
which is one of the--.the things that wWe

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:43.140
have to figure out how that came to be. So,
that really caught people's attention. And

00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:45.280
it started the field up.

00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:51.480
Now let's see what I mean by "insufficiently
complex." Suppose that Stanley thoughtlessly

00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:58.669
left out one of those molecules. Nothing would
have happened. The simulation would have been

00:05:58.669 --> 00:06:05.669
insufficiently complex. And so, in our laboratories
today, we're trying to learn how to make our

00:06:05.669 --> 00:06:08.139
simulations sufficiently complex.

00:06:08.139 --> 00:06:12.170
And that's what you're gonna hear about today.
And you're gonna hear about some results from

00:06:12.170 --> 00:06:19.110
this step toward the end of my talk today.
Well, the concepts I put together in "First

00:06:19.110 --> 00:06:24.870
Life" to produce something that I feel is
sufficiently complex are as follows:

00:06:24.870 --> 00:06:25.870
Conditions.

00:06:25.870 --> 00:06:30.919
I feel that there must have been compartments.
And that, really, is a fairly new concept.

00:06:30.919 --> 00:06:36.900
People did not think about life as beginning
as cells. People thought of life as beginning

00:06:36.900 --> 00:06:43.490
as molecules. But my claim is that we really
needed a cellular compartment to keep everything

00:06:43.490 --> 00:06:45.210
together in one place.

00:06:45.210 --> 00:06:49.290
There must have been a way to concentrate
the organic molecules that are gonna react.

00:06:49.290 --> 00:06:55.139
And they must be cycled. That's another thing
we don't think about when we do these simulations.

00:06:55.139 --> 00:07:00.120
We just turn on the spark and wait to see
what happens, or we add a couple of reactants

00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:01.680
and wait and see what happens.

00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:07.430
That's the chemist's way of doing things.
But there is another process, which I'm sure

00:07:07.430 --> 00:07:15.700
some of you have heard about called the polymerase
chain reaction- P-C-R. It depends on cycles.

00:07:15.700 --> 00:07:20.890
You put in a little bit of DNA. You cycle
it through a hot-cold cycle. A little bit

00:07:20.890 --> 00:07:23.290
more DNA is produced. Another hot-cold cycle.

00:07:23.290 --> 00:07:29.480
Forty or fifty cycles and you have millions
of times more DNA than you started with. This

00:07:29.480 --> 00:07:38.800
is a central process that is used in all molecular
biology laboratories today, discovered about

00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:44.699
maybe 30 years ago now. So, keep in mind cycles.
I think the cycles are important.

00:07:44.699 --> 00:07:48.830
There must have been a fluctuating environment.
The components we're talking about, of course,

00:07:48.830 --> 00:07:53.520
there must have been a source of organic compounds.
The first part of my talk I'm gonna tell you

00:07:53.520 --> 00:07:58.360
about one possible source, which is an extraterrestrial
source.

00:07:58.360 --> 00:08:02.419
We think that a lot of the organics were brought
to the Earth, available for the oceanorigin

00:08:02.419 --> 00:08:06.930
alikeof life, were delivered here in the late
accretion of our planet. And you're gonna

00:08:06.930 --> 00:08:12.919
hear about that. Then there had to be a source
of energy. You can't get reactions to go unless

00:08:12.919 --> 00:08:15.140
you go from uphill to downhill.

00:08:15.140 --> 00:08:19.639
There has to be a source of energy to get
the reactants uphill. Only then, can they

00:08:19.639 --> 00:08:24.870
react and go downhill toward equilibrium and
make something interesting. So we have to

00:08:24.870 --> 00:08:31.010
think about what energy source was available
on the early Earth to drive these reactions.

00:08:31.010 --> 00:08:36.149
Finally, sufficient complexity. That's gonna
involve self-assembly of these molecules.

00:08:36.149 --> 00:08:41.289
And I'm gonna demonstrate this to you. It
involves an organizing matrix. Now, this is

00:08:41.289 --> 00:08:46.540
a relatively new idea, by the way. We have
thought that probably clay might have been

00:08:46.540 --> 00:08:47.540
involved.

00:08:47.540 --> 00:08:52.779
The surface of clay can organize molecules
and allow certain polymerization reactions

00:08:52.779 --> 00:08:58.720
to occur. But I'm gonna tell you about a different
organizing matrix that we are working on.

00:08:58.720 --> 00:09:03.610
As a result of all this, you get what I call
"combinatorial chemistry."

00:09:03.610 --> 00:09:08.649
Each of these compartments is a microscopic
test tube and each compartment is different

00:09:08.649 --> 00:09:14.170
from all the others. It's a combination of
molecules in those individual compartments.

00:09:14.170 --> 00:09:19.610
And I'm talking about vast numbers of compartments
that would've been around on the early Earth.

00:09:19.610 --> 00:09:27.680
A few of these--a very few of these--likely
had a set of molecules that, by chance, could

00:09:27.680 --> 00:09:32.079
grow by polymerization. They could capture
energy and nutrients from the environment

00:09:32.079 --> 00:09:38.490
and undergo polymerization. Furthermore, not
only grow, but they can reproduce by some

00:09:38.490 --> 00:09:39.490
process.

00:09:39.490 --> 00:09:45.490
And right at the end of my talk, you're gonna
hear about a way to produce long nucleic acid

00:09:45.490 --> 00:09:51.319
strands and get them to reproduce under simulated
prebiotic conditions. So that's where I'm

00:09:51.319 --> 00:09:56.350
going in this talk. OK. Now I wanna talk a
little bit about how we got started in all

00:09:56.350 --> 00:10:05.170
of this. And that comes to my first reading.
There's only two of these, so don't worry.

00:10:05.170 --> 00:10:06.170
[laughter]

00:10:06.170 --> 00:10:07.170
[reads from book]

00:10:07.170 --> 00:10:12.089
"During the spring and summer of 1975, I was
spending a sabbatical leave with Alec Bangham

00:10:12.089 --> 00:10:17.379
in his Babraham laboratory just south of Cambridge,
England, when an idea emerged that guided

00:10:17.379 --> 00:10:19.179
me into research on the origin of life.

00:10:19.179 --> 00:10:25.850
“ A few years earlier, Alec had discovered
the self-assembly properties of phospholipid

00:10:25.850 --> 00:10:32.470
and showed that lecithin extracted from egg
yolks could produce microscopic vesicles,

00:10:32.470 --> 00:10:36.829
ultimately forming structures that we now
call liposomes.

00:10:36.829 --> 00:10:42.279
“One summer day, Alec and I were driving
to London in his beloved Morris Mini, we pulled

00:10:42.279 --> 00:10:47.389
over to the side of the road to enjoy some
cucumber sandwiches--I'll never forget that--prepared

00:10:47.389 --> 00:10:52.480
by Rosalyn Bangham, that's Alec's wife. Now
the conversation turned to a lecture that

00:10:52.480 --> 00:10:57.540
Alec had given a few years earlier at Bristol
University with the title, ‘Membranes Came

00:10:57.540 --> 00:10:59.430
First.’

00:10:59.430 --> 00:11:05.040
“Alec argued that the self-assembly properties
of lipids were such that the membrane's vesicles

00:11:05.040 --> 00:11:10.459
must have been present on the early Earth,
long before nucleic acids and proteins came

00:11:10.459 --> 00:11:16.459
along. But then we were stumped. What was
the prebiotic equivalent of lipids that can

00:11:16.459 --> 00:11:20.449
self-assemble into membranes and where did
they come from?"

00:11:20.449 --> 00:11:21.449
[ends reading]

00:11:21.449 --> 00:11:32.600
Well, here is Alec's image. This is from 1971.
He let me take a picture of this. And back

00:11:32.600 --> 00:11:37.910
in the old days, before PowerPoint and Keynote
and video projectors, if you were giving a

00:11:37.910 --> 00:11:42.620
scientific talk--I'm sure you won't believe
this--you had to make a drawing of what you

00:11:42.620 --> 00:11:46.220
wanted to talk about, take a picture, and
make a slide of that.

00:11:46.220 --> 00:11:51.360
That's the way it used to be done. These days,
of course, we left that far behind. But I

00:11:51.360 --> 00:11:56.389
still remember the thrill I have when I gave
my very first computer-aided talk like this.

00:11:56.389 --> 00:12:01.940
It makes things so much easier. In any event,
notice that Alec has the Earth and a very

00:12:01.940 --> 00:12:03.509
thick ocean.

00:12:03.509 --> 00:12:12.050
He shows evolution going around in a cycle.
He shows sodium and potassium ions in the

00:12:12.050 --> 00:12:16.881
ocean. And he shows a monolayer. Look right
down there at the bottom. And you can see

00:12:16.881 --> 00:12:21.639
a lot of little squiggly tails. Those are
hydrocarbons. The head group is hydrophilic--

00:12:21.639 --> 00:12:25.839
water-loving-- so it sticks down into the
water, dissolves in the water.

00:12:25.839 --> 00:12:31.750
But the tail cannot dissolve. Oil and water
don't mix. So this is a monolayer. Then, he

00:12:31.750 --> 00:12:36.860
said, if you have some sort of aerodynamic
perturbation protovation, just wind, tides,

00:12:36.860 --> 00:12:43.249
waves in action, and so forth, that those
monolayers would crimp inward and turn into

00:12:43.249 --> 00:12:44.329
liposomes.

00:12:44.329 --> 00:12:51.449
So that is his idea about why membranes could
come first. And really, from that moment on,

00:12:51.449 --> 00:12:57.399
I've been testing that idea. I'd like to show
you Alec Bangham. This is a picture I took

00:12:57.399 --> 00:13:02.759
about seven or eight years ago. And there
you see him making self-assembled amphiphilic

00:13:02.759 --> 00:13:04.589
membranes in his backyard.

00:13:04.589 --> 00:13:10.579
Those, by the way, are called soap bubbles
in common language. And really, a soap bubble

00:13:10.579 --> 00:13:15.959
is a membrane. It's a self-assembled membrane.
I would guess everybody in this room at one

00:13:15.959 --> 00:13:19.939
time in your life has blown some bubbles like
Alec is doing up there.

00:13:19.939 --> 00:13:25.379
What I'm gonna do now though, is to show you
what Alec saw under the microscope when he

00:13:25.379 --> 00:13:29.980
first discovered the self-assembly property
of phospholipid.

00:13:29.980 --> 00:13:43.060
[jazz piano music plays]

00:13:43.060 --> 00:14:01.769
He did not have the jazz piano background,
by the way. That's what it looks like. I do

00:14:01.769 --> 00:14:03.500
this work in my lab. Watch the lipid reacting
with water to produce these beautiful self-assembled

00:14:03.500 --> 00:14:04.500
structures.

00:14:04.500 --> 00:14:14.929
Our claim is that something like upward of
[jazz music continues over voice ]. This is

00:14:14.929 --> 00:14:20.459
what Alec saw in the electron microscope.
This is just one accident, by the way. He

00:14:20.459 --> 00:14:26.230
wanted to test out their new microscope and
he had these interesting self-assembled structures.

00:14:26.230 --> 00:14:31.519
So he put that under the microscope and added
what's called a negative stain that lets him

00:14:31.519 --> 00:14:38.279
see, literally, the single-molecule level.
And he saw not just globs, but he saw those

00:14:38.279 --> 00:14:48.399
layers. You can probably count ten or twenty
layers in that structure. This is a multilamellar

00:14:48.399 --> 00:14:49.709
phospholipid structure.

00:14:49.709 --> 00:14:58.129
And he called these, in his paper, multilamellar
phospholipid mesophases, which is a bit of

00:14:58.129 --> 00:15:05.269
a mouthful. So, people began calling them
Banghasomes in his honor. And GJerry Weissmann,

00:15:05.269 --> 00:15:11.059
an early visitor to his lab before I got there,
invented this word: liposomes.

00:15:11.059 --> 00:15:18.049
You may have heard of liposomes because their
properties were not lost on the cosmetic industry.

00:15:18.049 --> 00:15:23.879
Christian Dior captured liposomes without
telling Alec, by the way. Alec learned about

00:15:23.879 --> 00:15:31.949
this because his wife, Rosalyn, received an
ad like this in the mail, saying that they

00:15:31.949 --> 00:15:41.019
had this cosmetic called "Capture XR60/80
Bi-Skin Extra-Vital Skin Restoring Serum."

00:15:41.019 --> 00:15:48.509
And look there. Powerful liposome system.
So this is now used to deliver cosmetic materials

00:15:48.509 --> 00:15:54.040
to skin surfaces-- anti-wrinkles and all that
stuff. It's also used in the drug industry.

00:15:54.040 --> 00:16:00.170
There are anti-tumor agents that are captured
in liposomes, injected into the bloodstream,

00:16:00.170 --> 00:16:06.189
carried to the tumor cell, and produce death
of the tumor cell.

00:16:06.189 --> 00:16:11.290
So, liposomes are very powerful, far beyond
what I'm telling you about today with the

00:16:11.290 --> 00:16:16.230
origin of life. I have always been amused
by that little story. Well, that brings me

00:16:16.230 --> 00:16:19.740
to the next little reading--my last one.

00:16:19.740 --> 00:16:22.240
[reads from book]

00:16:22.240 --> 00:16:28.699
"In the summer of 1981, a small, black stone
wrapped in aluminum foil changed the course

00:16:28.699 --> 00:16:33.369
of my life. About the size of a marble and
indistinguishable from any other rock that

00:16:33.369 --> 00:16:38.049
might be found on a beach, this stone had
traveledtravelled from southeastern Australia

00:16:38.049 --> 00:16:42.220
to the NASA Ames Research Center in Mountain
View, California."

00:16:42.220 --> 00:16:44.239
Literally just down the street from here.

00:16:44.239 --> 00:16:49.679
"Where researcher Sherwood Chang showed me
the specimen and gave me a small sample. But

00:16:49.679 --> 00:16:53.819
the stone had traveledtravelled even further.
It was a piece of a meteor that lit up the

00:16:53.819 --> 00:16:59.180
night sky over the town of Murchison, Australia
in September 1969.

00:16:59.180 --> 00:17:04.560
“ The fall began with a bright orange fireball,
rolling thunder followed minutes later by

00:17:04.560 --> 00:17:11.329
a shower of black stone, strewn over five
square miles. I held in my hand a genuine

00:17:11.329 --> 00:17:16.339
rock from outer space. But there was more
to this meteorite than just the mineral content,

00:17:16.339 --> 00:17:17.959
typical of other stony meteorites.

00:17:17.959 --> 00:17:24.139
“ The first stones to be discovered just
hours after they fell were still emitting

00:17:24.139 --> 00:17:29.700
a smoky aroma from their hot surfaces. And
the first time I ground up a marble-sized

00:17:29.700 --> 00:17:36.100
sample of the meteorite, this strange, penetrating
odor rose from the mortar, simultaneously

00:17:36.100 --> 00:17:42.100
smoky, dusty, and sour, reminiscent of a cigar
butt, or the contents of a vacuum cleaner

00:17:42.100 --> 00:17:43.100
bag.

00:17:43.100 --> 00:17:49.080
“It was this sticky smell that I would now
recognize anywhere. It was the odor of outer

00:17:49.080 --> 00:17:55.010
space, nearly five billion years old--the
aroma of organic compounds that were delivered

00:17:55.010 --> 00:18:00.210
directly to the Earth during the birth of
our solar system. Nothing could be more convincing

00:18:00.210 --> 00:18:05.289
at the link between organic processes and
life on the Earth."

00:18:05.289 --> 00:18:12.789
So, this is NASA Ames as it looks today. There's
a nice name given over to the building that

00:18:12.789 --> 00:18:19.380
Sherwood worked in, that I worked in. The
Astrobiology and Life Sciences Laboratory.

00:18:19.380 --> 00:18:25.210
My first visit in 1981. And this is what Sherwood
looked like back then, as a young man. He's

00:18:25.210 --> 00:18:31.290
now retired. He's got his own ranch up in
far Northern California. And this is the kind

00:18:31.290 --> 00:18:35.480
of thing that he gave to me, not this particular
piece. Just a piece I got later, but he gave

00:18:35.480 --> 00:18:38.669
me a little chunk, not that big to work with.

00:18:38.669 --> 00:18:44.290
So, I'm a lipid-biophysicist. And I was still
trying to think of a way to test that question

00:18:44.290 --> 00:18:49.980
that Alec and I thought about. What were the
first kinds of lipids? So, if you're a lipid

00:18:49.980 --> 00:18:56.440
person, you use an organic solvent to extract
what you're interested in. And nobody had

00:18:56.440 --> 00:18:57.700
tried this before.

00:18:57.700 --> 00:19:03.250
So I treated a chunk of that Murchison with
chloroform and methanol and you're gonna hear

00:19:03.250 --> 00:19:09.950
about that as soon as I tell you just a bit
about where it came from. So, one source of

00:19:09.950 --> 00:19:16.620
organic compounds on the early Earth is delivery
during late accretion. So this is the asteroid

00:19:16.620 --> 00:19:17.920
Eros.

00:19:17.920 --> 00:19:24.710
And it's from a NASA JPL slide-by in the last
few years. Look at the impact craters. Those

00:19:24.710 --> 00:19:32.059
are on every asteroid we've looked at. Those
impact craters occur when a smaller chunk

00:19:32.059 --> 00:19:37.590
of stone hits the larger chunk. And we've
actually seen that happen just by chance.

00:19:37.590 --> 00:19:43.740
This image was captured when people were looking
at the asteroid belt. And they saw what looked

00:19:43.740 --> 00:19:49.480
at first like a comet, but it wasn't. It turns
out that that tail coming out, that little

00:19:49.480 --> 00:19:55.750
white speck there, you can see in the enlarged
in-set, was in fact, potential meteorites.

00:19:55.750 --> 00:20:00.880
Any of those chunks that happened to hit the
Earth would have been a meteorite. And this

00:20:00.880 --> 00:20:06.679
is how the Murchison meteorite got here. So
we're seeing, with carbonaceous meteorites,

00:20:06.679 --> 00:20:14.380
samples of extraterrestrial material that
probably came about the same time as the Earth.

00:20:14.380 --> 00:20:19.520
And it's been delivering organic compounds
to the Earth ever since and so, as you saw

00:20:19.520 --> 00:20:23.870
in that Murchison meteorite. This is what
it would look like if you happened to look

00:20:23.870 --> 00:20:28.470
up in the sky. This is just a Photoshop version
that I put together for illustrating purposes,

00:20:28.470 --> 00:20:30.940
but there was an explosion up there.

00:20:30.940 --> 00:20:36.059
And the pieces fell to Earth in the little
town of Murchison, Australia. This is a real

00:20:36.059 --> 00:20:40.860
image of the town of Murchison that you can
see in the upper left corner. And each of

00:20:40.860 --> 00:20:46.799
those red spots represents a place where pieces
of Murchison, maybe about this size to this

00:20:46.799 --> 00:20:50.549
size, were picked up along with hundreds of
smaller pieces.

00:20:50.549 --> 00:20:54.279
Those are the ones that I've worked with.
So those are in museums all over the world.

00:20:54.279 --> 00:21:00.090
They've been worked on extensively by the
community with an interest in this. And we

00:21:00.090 --> 00:21:05.810
know more about the Murchison than any other
meteorite so far. So, this is why they're

00:21:05.810 --> 00:21:06.810
so interesting.

00:21:06.810 --> 00:21:12.490
If you analyze the Murchison, you discover
it's around two percent organic material by

00:21:12.490 --> 00:21:19.009
weight, most of which is a polymer called
kerogen, or kerogen-like polymer. But some

00:21:19.009 --> 00:21:26.140
of them are soluble--that little red pie slip
there. And then of the soluble, you can see

00:21:26.140 --> 00:21:28.500
that some of them are carboxylic acids.

00:21:28.500 --> 00:21:34.880
There are dicarboxylic acids, amino acids,
amides, aliphatic hydrocarbons, aromatic hydrocarbons,

00:21:34.880 --> 00:21:41.560
aldehydes, alcohols, amines, and even purines.
You know that amino acids are what we use

00:21:41.560 --> 00:21:47.360
as monomers for proteins. Purines, like adenine,
are used in nucleic acids.

00:21:47.360 --> 00:21:53.040
So here is literally all, or most, of the
stuff we would want to have available if we're

00:21:53.040 --> 00:21:59.730
gonna think about how life could begin. What
I want to call attention to is the carboxylic

00:21:59.730 --> 00:22:04.670
acids, which are about half of the mass of
the organics. And one of them that you're

00:22:04.670 --> 00:22:09.809
gonna see is a membrane-forming compound,
because that's what we discovered.

00:22:09.809 --> 00:22:15.670
And here it is. So, I extracted a chunk of
the Murchison, maybe a gram sample, put it

00:22:15.670 --> 00:22:20.990
into a mixture of chloroform and methanol,
ground it up, took the sample and put it under

00:22:20.990 --> 00:22:26.380
a microscope and let the chloroform dry. And
then you add water, which is the way you watch

00:22:26.380 --> 00:22:30.990
self-assembly, and this is what I saw. Really
quite extraordinary.

00:22:30.990 --> 00:22:36.870
This stuff has never been alive, never part
of a life process, but it still could self-assemble

00:22:36.870 --> 00:22:43.120
into membranous vesicles. And we propose that
these are the kinds of compartments that would

00:22:43.120 --> 00:22:48.769
have been available on the early Earth for
the first living cells to take advantage of

00:22:48.769 --> 00:22:53.080
as a house to live in, as they did the rest
of what life is all about.

00:22:53.080 --> 00:22:58.550
So here's a phase image of some of the vesicles.
We captured some fluorescent dye in it. That's

00:22:58.550 --> 00:23:02.759
what you see over on the right-hand side there,
just to demonstrate that these are actually

00:23:02.759 --> 00:23:05.730
compartments that can contain something.

00:23:05.730 --> 00:23:10.470
And what you're going to hear a little bit
later is that these compartments have some

00:23:10.470 --> 00:23:17.990
very special properties helping polymerization
to occur. Well, what are those membrane components?

00:23:17.990 --> 00:23:26.740
One last trip to Stanford and we took some
of that sample to Dick Zeder'sZare's lab.

00:23:26.740 --> 00:23:32.169
He's got a beautiful mass spectrometer to
work with. And he sent me back this image

00:23:32.169 --> 00:23:39.620
which shows that what that stuff is, is octanoic
acid, nonanoic acid, decanoic acid, and all

00:23:39.620 --> 00:23:46.009
the way up to 13 carbons long. This is what
those things look like, by the way.

00:23:46.009 --> 00:23:51.649
In a membrane, you have a hydrocarbon tail--the
black and white--and you have the hydrophilic

00:23:51.649 --> 00:23:57.100
head group. This is nothing but soap. You
wash your hands with this. It cleans it off.

00:23:57.100 --> 00:24:02.580
This is a soap molecule. So, we had found
soap molecules in the Murchison meteorite

00:24:02.580 --> 00:24:07.082
and discovered that they could self-assemble
into those membrane structures that I showed

00:24:07.082 --> 00:24:08.082
you there.

00:24:08.082 --> 00:24:17.399
Really quite extraordinary. So there's what
those things look like. They've been stained

00:24:17.399 --> 00:24:22.400
with a fluorescent dye. That's just decanoic
acid. That's this stuff, just to prove that

00:24:22.400 --> 00:24:30.280
it can form membranes. Well, before I go to
the next step, I'm gonna do a little demonstration

00:24:30.280 --> 00:24:37.980
for you just to nail down in your minds how
simple the formation of membranes encapsulating

00:24:37.980 --> 00:24:38.980
stuff is.

00:24:38.980 --> 00:24:48.539
So I used to be a teenage magician and this
is as close as I get these days to doing a

00:24:48.539 --> 00:24:54.640
little bit of magic. Here's just a buffer
solution--water plus a little bit of buffer

00:24:54.640 --> 00:25:01.950
in it. Here's a nucleic acid. This particular
one is ribonucleic acid, but I could use deoxyribonucleic

00:25:01.950 --> 00:25:03.309
acid as well--DNA.

00:25:03.309 --> 00:25:10.129
So, I'm gonna put a few milligrams in here.
It dissolves right away. This is water soluble.

00:25:10.129 --> 00:25:16.450
And the question is how could something like
this, even if it got synthesized by some process

00:25:16.450 --> 00:25:22.120
on the early Earth, how could it get into
these vesicles I showed you, because vesicles

00:25:22.120 --> 00:25:24.580
are relatively impermeable to make molecules?

00:25:24.580 --> 00:25:31.399
There must be a mechanism. And if you just
do nothing more than dry down your lipid,

00:25:31.399 --> 00:25:41.630
mix in your solution, and shake it up, what
you discover is that you have self-assembled

00:25:41.630 --> 00:25:47.390
lipid vesicles. That's that cloudiness you
see there. And the lipid vesicles have encapsulated

00:25:47.390 --> 00:25:48.390
the RNA.

00:25:48.390 --> 00:25:54.140
It's as simple as that to make what we call
protocells. These are steps toward the origin

00:25:54.140 --> 00:26:01.110
of life--biggish molecules with potential
catalytic replicating ability trapped inside

00:26:01.110 --> 00:26:07.230
lipid vesicles. So, that's how simple it is.
So we're not saying anything outlandish when

00:26:07.230 --> 00:26:11.629
I claim that it's easy to do and easy to conceive
of.

00:26:11.629 --> 00:26:16.970
Now we're actually trying to see whether that
does any good with respect to the origin of

00:26:16.970 --> 00:26:23.779
a replicating catalytic system. Well, I wanted
to take you one more step in the history of

00:26:23.779 --> 00:26:30.600
this. I visited NASA Ames again in the early
1990s. And by this time we had shown that

00:26:30.600 --> 00:26:35.250
the meteorite membranes could be produced
from the Murchison components.

00:26:35.250 --> 00:26:41.620
And Lou Allamandola was an astrochemist. He's
still active at NASA Ames. And Jason Dwoarkin

00:26:41.620 --> 00:26:46.690
had just finished his Ph. D.Ph.D. with Stanley
Miller and wanted to do his post-doctoral

00:26:46.690 --> 00:26:54.190
work in the astrochemistry laboratory with
Lou. So, we decided to see whether this stuff

00:26:54.190 --> 00:27:02.750
that Lou was synthesizing as a simulation
of what goes on in what is called pre-cometary

00:27:02.750 --> 00:27:03.750
ice.

00:27:03.750 --> 00:27:07.539
And you're gonna understand that. I gotta
show you a few more things before you understand

00:27:07.539 --> 00:27:15.440
it completely. But what he does is cool a
chamber, a vacuum chamber, down to liquid

00:27:15.440 --> 00:27:22.279
helium temperatures and then he injects gases
into the chamber, including water, methanol,

00:27:22.279 --> 00:27:23.809
carbon monoxide, and ammonia.

00:27:23.809 --> 00:27:31.149
And a thin layer of ice forms on that ultra-cold
surface. Then he bombards that surface with

00:27:31.149 --> 00:27:37.759
ultraviolet radiation and this is what happens
in what we call molecular clouds. Our Earth,

00:27:37.759 --> 00:27:45.570
our solar system and stars, are all born in
dense molecular clouds, light years in dimensions.

00:27:45.570 --> 00:27:50.889
And you're gonna see a little bit more about
that momentarily. And as this occurs, that

00:27:50.889 --> 00:27:59.179
ice with the UV impinging on it can make big
molecules. And here's what we then published

00:27:59.179 --> 00:28:06.590
after a couple of years of work. "Self-assembling
amphiphilic molecules: Synthesis of simulated

00:28:06.590 --> 00:28:09.809
interstellar/pre-cometaryprecometary ices."

00:28:09.809 --> 00:28:16.429
So the answer to where the stuff in the Murchison
came from is it was, a lot of it anyway, was

00:28:16.429 --> 00:28:20.611
synthesized on the surface of these little
dust particles that I'm gonna show you in

00:28:20.611 --> 00:28:25.679
just a minute. So this is the kind of image
that we saw, starting with nothing more than

00:28:25.679 --> 00:28:29.429
water, methanol, carbon monoxide, ammonia.

00:28:29.429 --> 00:28:37.169
And when you hit this with UV radiation, it
produces complex molecules and I would not

00:28:37.169 --> 00:28:43.230
be able to tell you, if I had seen that image
on the right, the fluorescent image, I would

00:28:43.230 --> 00:28:47.889
not have been able to tell you is this the
Murchison material, or is this the synthesized

00:28:47.889 --> 00:28:48.889
material.

00:28:48.889 --> 00:28:54.360
They're really very similar in their properties.
So, that really gave us yet another answer.

00:28:54.360 --> 00:28:59.120
So I'm gonna summarize now the first half
of my talk. This is what a dense molecular

00:28:59.120 --> 00:29:04.840
cloud looks like. We call it an interstellar
dense molecular cloud because they're between

00:29:04.840 --> 00:29:08.159
stars and they're dense rather than being
diffuse.

00:29:08.159 --> 00:29:13.009
They're mostly made up of dust particles.
These are little silicate mineral dust particles,

00:29:13.009 --> 00:29:20.749
micron-size range, and hydrogen. That's what
composes both. Star formation. That's where

00:29:20.749 --> 00:29:26.200
stars are produced. And solar system. The
stars, early in their career, begin to make

00:29:26.200 --> 00:29:32.370
hard UV radiation and that, then, is what
illuminates the dust particles and drives

00:29:32.370 --> 00:29:34.909
the kind of chemistry I've just shown you.

00:29:34.909 --> 00:29:40.279
So, let's show you a little summary of this.
There's that dust particle. It's about the

00:29:40.279 --> 00:29:44.259
size of a bacterium, by the way, just a few
microns across. So, nothing but a silicate

00:29:44.259 --> 00:29:50.440
mineral, olivine, pyroxene. These are ordinary
minerals. But it's spewed out by stars, supernova,

00:29:50.440 --> 00:29:52.029
and nova when they explode.

00:29:52.029 --> 00:29:58.700
The dust particles accumulate ice mantles.
The ice mantle begins with very simple compounds--water,

00:29:58.700 --> 00:30:04.650
methanol, carbon monoxide, and ammonia. UV
radiation is the energy source that drives

00:30:04.650 --> 00:30:10.590
a synthesis of all that stuff on the right-hand
side, including amino acids, ketones, amides,

00:30:10.590 --> 00:30:12.200
quinones, and amphiphile.

00:30:12.200 --> 00:30:19.480
And amphiphile is like a soap molecule. Those
then accrete in the early solar system, form

00:30:19.480 --> 00:30:26.600
comets, planetesimals, bringing the =organic
stuff along. Those then accrete to form planets,

00:30:26.600 --> 00:30:33.940
like our Earth, and deliver the trio to the
early Earth. But, but, one little problem.

00:30:33.940 --> 00:30:40.480
The early Earth went through a collision with
a Mars-sized object. This melted the early

00:30:40.480 --> 00:30:47.570
Earth. It volatilized all of the organic material
that might have been there and so we are left

00:30:47.570 --> 00:30:52.490
again with the question, where did this stuff
come from? There must have been lots of stuff

00:30:52.490 --> 00:30:55.200
delivered during this accretion of the early
Earth.

00:30:55.200 --> 00:30:59.999
But here now, we've melted it to volcanic
temperatures that completely destroys all

00:30:59.999 --> 00:31:05.330
organic material, so we have to think a little
bit further. And here's what we now think.

00:31:05.330 --> 00:31:10.820
So, there's a molten moon forming from this
debris ring. There's the molten Earth.

00:31:10.820 --> 00:31:16.499
The organic material has been vaporized. Sooner
or later, the Earth cools, oceans form, but

00:31:16.499 --> 00:31:22.929
there's none of that original organic material.
So what we think is that comets and meteorites

00:31:22.929 --> 00:31:30.129
and what we call interplanetary dust particles
that have organic material on them, all helped

00:31:30.129 --> 00:31:36.559
produce these of this last accretionary process
that gave us a lot of the organics we need.

00:31:36.559 --> 00:31:40.389
So, you can see the record of this in the
moon. Look at it through a telescope. You

00:31:40.389 --> 00:31:45.399
see all the craters remaining from about three
point eight billion years ago. And you also--.

00:31:45.399 --> 00:31:52.590
We know that the moon got hit, the Earth got
hit, and all of that stuff is delivering organic

00:31:52.590 --> 00:31:56.980
material and water back to the early Earth
when this was happening.

00:31:56.980 --> 00:32:02.179
By the way, the ocean is probably in the range
of ten percent comet-water. A lot of the water

00:32:02.179 --> 00:32:08.119
in the ocean came out of the Earth's interior
during the volcanic outgassing at that time.

00:32:08.119 --> 00:32:13.090
So that's, as I say, the first half of what
I want to tell you about. Just to drill this

00:32:13.090 --> 00:32:15.789
in, this is a comet that we've seen recently.

00:32:15.789 --> 00:32:20.779
We've had another probe go 'round the comet
in orbit. It's taken these beautiful pictures.

00:32:20.779 --> 00:32:25.759
This is called a Temple1 comet. This is still
not the comet that we can see. It's pretty

00:32:25.759 --> 00:32:31.249
far out in the solar system. When we analyze
comets, we see that they're about 60% percent

00:32:31.249 --> 00:32:35.899
water ice, 30% percent mineral particles,
and ten percent10% organic compounds.

00:32:35.899 --> 00:32:41.830
So, just imagine now these are delivering
water to the oceans on the early Earth. And

00:32:41.830 --> 00:32:48.590
some of this organic stuff survives the impact
of delivery and would have been available

00:32:48.590 --> 00:32:53.710
for this process. You don't get a sense of
how big comets are, but what I did here is

00:32:53.710 --> 00:32:56.879
to put the skyline of Manhattan to give you--.

00:32:56.879 --> 00:33:02.210
It's several kilometers in diameters. It's
what comets really look like when they go

00:33:02.210 --> 00:33:10.030
past. And we're gonna see them again. OK?
OK, now let's go back to four billion years

00:33:10.030 --> 00:33:14.720
ago and think about what the early Earth was
like. Here's an artist's version of the early

00:33:14.720 --> 00:33:15.720
Earth.

00:33:15.720 --> 00:33:19.559
And if you didn't know that was the early
Earth, you might think that that was one of

00:33:19.559 --> 00:33:24.980
the islands of Hawaii, like the big island.
'Cause the early Earth was volcanic. A lot

00:33:24.980 --> 00:33:32.570
of the land masses poking up through the salty
ocean were volcanic in nature. And so, we

00:33:32.570 --> 00:33:35.389
have a nitrogen and carbon dioxide atmosphere.

00:33:35.389 --> 00:33:41.830
The nitrogen was still around at that time--very
unreactive. The carbon dioxide was many-fold

00:33:41.830 --> 00:33:48.440
greater than it is today. Most of that carbon
dioxide has now turned into limestone. But

00:33:48.440 --> 00:33:53.419
back then, that was our atmosphere. No oxygen
to speak of. There is a lot of energy available.

00:33:53.419 --> 00:33:58.299
Thermal energy, light energy. Salty ocean.
Because there were land masses, there would

00:33:58.299 --> 00:34:03.820
be freshwater ponds by precipitation. There'd
be electrical discharge, yet another form

00:34:03.820 --> 00:34:09.200
of energy. And that's what we had to work
with. In our minds, we say to ourselves, "That's

00:34:09.200 --> 00:34:10.490
the early Earth."

00:34:10.490 --> 00:34:18.370
Well, what can we do with that concept? Let's
think about what was needed back then to get

00:34:18.370 --> 00:34:25.670
life started. Conceptually, pretty simple.
You needed some monomers that could form polymers.

00:34:25.670 --> 00:34:29.980
We know that amino acids are in meteorites,
so we imagine that amino acids were being

00:34:29.980 --> 00:34:33.470
sprinkled down, or synthesized, on the early
Earth.

00:34:33.470 --> 00:34:38.760
We know that nucleobases like adenine are
in meteorites, so we imagine there might have

00:34:38.760 --> 00:34:43.520
been ways for nucleobases to be delivered,
or synthesized. We know carbohydrates are

00:34:43.520 --> 00:34:47.340
in meteorites. That's work with George Cooper,
just right up at NASA Ames.

00:34:47.340 --> 00:34:51.330
And we know there must have been phosphate
there. So, we're sort of on the way. This

00:34:51.330 --> 00:34:56.660
is what we imagine would necessarily be there.
Then, I say that there must have been amphiphiles

00:34:56.660 --> 00:35:00.270
to produce these compartments that I've told
you is so important.

00:35:00.270 --> 00:35:05.460
When I talk about self-assembly, I wanna make
sure that you understand what I mean by that.

00:35:05.460 --> 00:35:11.620
Most of you probably know that DNA is a double-helix.
You can melt the double-helix, which is double-helix.

00:35:11.620 --> 00:35:15.490
You can melt it into single chains just by
raising the temperature.

00:35:15.490 --> 00:35:19.660
And it doesn't have to be very high, maybe
70, 80, 90 degrees, and you've melted the

00:35:19.660 --> 00:35:26.600
double-helix. If you then cool it down, those
two single strands find each other. They wind

00:35:26.600 --> 00:35:33.310
back up into the original double-helix. That
is a self-assembly process. Nothing makes

00:35:33.310 --> 00:35:34.310
it happen.

00:35:34.310 --> 00:35:38.860
It just happens because of the properties,
the chemical, physical properties of the nucleic

00:35:38.860 --> 00:35:44.530
acids. When a protein is synthesized coming
off the ribosome, there's no folding. As it

00:35:44.530 --> 00:35:51.320
comes off, it folds into a specific structure.
This is essential for life to occur. If that

00:35:51.320 --> 00:35:54.220
folding were not very precise, we could not
be here.

00:35:54.220 --> 00:35:59.520
That's another self-assembly. Finally what
I've shown you is the lipid self-assembly

00:35:59.520 --> 00:36:09.400
into membranes. Well, I wanted to challenge
myself and my colleagues to think beyond the

00:36:09.400 --> 00:36:16.590
laboratory. The question is I've shown you
self-assembly occurring under laboratory conditions

00:36:16.590 --> 00:36:19.240
and I claim that it might happen on the early
Earth.

00:36:19.240 --> 00:36:26.550
Is there any way I can go beyond just a hand-waving
claim? Well, I think what we have to do is

00:36:26.550 --> 00:36:35.750
to try our experiments in a natural, prebiotic,
analog environment, such as Bumpass Hell.

00:36:35.750 --> 00:36:41.150
Bumpass Hell is a few hours’ drive north
of here. It's a little volcanic outbreak on

00:36:41.150 --> 00:36:42.520
Mount Lassen.

00:36:42.520 --> 00:36:48.030
And it's amazing to visit. I recommend it.
It's about a mile hike in from the road, very

00:36:48.030 --> 00:36:52.930
easy to get to. So, can you imagine life starting
up in something like this? Now, I'm gonna

00:36:52.930 --> 00:37:02.020
claim that this is the kind of condition that
prevailed on the early Earth and the conditions

00:37:02.020 --> 00:37:07.770
of such an environment are what would have
given rise to the polymerization processes

00:37:07.770 --> 00:37:10.061
that finally gave rise to living cells.

00:37:10.061 --> 00:37:17.320
Charles Darwin was thinking about the same
thing long ago. Here's a little note he put

00:37:17.320 --> 00:37:23.380
in a letter to his friend, J. D. Hooker, in
1871. "But if and oh what a big if, we could

00:37:23.380 --> 00:37:29.760
conceive some warm, little pond with all sorts
of ammonia and phosphoric salts, light, heat,

00:37:29.760 --> 00:37:35.820
electricity present, that a protein compound
was chemically formed and ready to undergo

00:37:35.820 --> 00:37:41.030
still more complex changes. At the present
day, such matter would be instantly devoured

00:37:41.030 --> 00:37:46.300
or absorbed, which would not have been the
case before living creatures were formed."

00:37:46.300 --> 00:37:51.600
So wasn't a prescient thought. This guy was
smart. He was looking ahead to what we're

00:37:51.600 --> 00:37:56.630
doing right now, thinking about warm, little
ponds. I think about hot, little puddles,

00:37:56.630 --> 00:38:01.640
thinking that something like proteins, a polymer,
could be formed. And, really, my hat's off

00:38:01.640 --> 00:38:04.620
to Uncle Charlie for thinking that and writing
it down.

00:38:04.620 --> 00:38:10.020
Here's what I think Charles Darwin's warm,
little pond might look now that we know more

00:38:10.020 --> 00:38:16.100
about it. It would have been in a volcanic
setting, such as I showed you at Bumpass Hell.

00:38:16.100 --> 00:38:20.220
Here's one in a very famous painting in the
basement of the Smithsonian, what the Earth

00:38:20.220 --> 00:38:22.320
was like several billion years ago.

00:38:22.320 --> 00:38:31.740
So, here's a warm, little pond of what we
know now. And I decided to go to Kamchatka.

00:38:31.740 --> 00:38:37.790
The Bumpass Hell is right in the middle of
a lot of plant life and a lot of people tramping

00:38:37.790 --> 00:38:44.420
by. I wanted to go to a sterile environment,
a still and analog environment. And such an

00:38:44.420 --> 00:38:47.380
environment is in Kamchatka, Russia.

00:38:47.380 --> 00:38:54.670
I've been there twice. The Kamchatka geothermal
regions I consider to be what we call primitive

00:38:54.670 --> 00:38:59.790
Earth analog environments. High altitude,
high latitude, and volcanism produce sterile

00:38:59.790 --> 00:39:06.670
sites for experimental tests. Can self-assembly
occur? This is what Kamchatka looks like.

00:39:06.670 --> 00:39:12.820
If you go two thousand miles East, you're
in Anchorage, Alaska, which is where we fly

00:39:12.820 --> 00:39:18.360
out of to get here. We landed at Petropavlovsk,
the little upper arrow there. We hop in a

00:39:18.360 --> 00:39:23.760
Russian troop carrier and about five hours
later, we are delivered to Mount Mutnovski

00:39:23.760 --> 00:39:27.480
Menovski, which is the little bottom arrow
there. Here's one of our trips.

00:39:27.480 --> 00:39:33.640
Some of the people in the audience know some
of these people. Jan and Jake are well-known

00:39:33.640 --> 00:39:39.410
astrobiologists now. They were post-doctoral
people at the Carnegie Institution of Washington.

00:39:39.410 --> 00:39:48.840
Jamie [ ]Elsila, Megan Spencer were graduate
students right here at Stanford University

00:39:48.840 --> 00:39:50.040
in Dick Zeder'sare's lab.

00:39:50.040 --> 00:39:56.750
Jamie is now working astrobiological problems
at Goddard. Then we have Vladimir in the white

00:39:56.750 --> 00:40:04.180
cap, white coat. He was our local organizer.
And clear to the right is Igor, who was our

00:40:04.180 --> 00:40:08.610
guide for this trip. And clear to the left
is my buddy and neighbor, Tony Hoffman, who

00:40:08.610 --> 00:40:13.930
is the photographer on this little field expedition.
Here we are climbing up.

00:40:13.930 --> 00:40:19.700
It's about a two thousand foot climb from
this little hut we stayed in to the crater.

00:40:19.700 --> 00:40:24.610
Here's Vladimir looking down into the crater
of Mount MenovskiMutnovski. When I think about

00:40:24.610 --> 00:40:32.290
the primitive Earth, this is my vision of
it--sterile, nothing's there, very dilute

00:40:32.290 --> 00:40:37.640
organic solution of stuff that might be there
from [ ]infall from synthesis.

00:40:37.640 --> 00:40:43.170
Hot water, steaming volcanism all over the
place, and little ponds that we can use as

00:40:43.170 --> 00:40:49.200
experiments. Here's a fumarole. And I reached
down in the fumarole just to test whether

00:40:49.200 --> 00:40:55.830
any organic material was there, anything alive.
And I pulled out a flask full of mud. We took

00:40:55.830 --> 00:41:00.560
this back to my lab here at Santa Cruz and
analyzed it.

00:41:00.560 --> 00:41:06.520
And really, there was nothing there. We had
no indication of any organic material and

00:41:06.520 --> 00:41:11.790
no indication for sure of anything alive.
So, this is a good place to do the experiment

00:41:11.790 --> 00:41:12.890
I'm gonna show you.

00:41:12.890 --> 00:41:18.210
So, I revised Darwin's conjecture and said
to myself, "But if, and oh what a big if,

00:41:18.210 --> 00:41:23.860
we could conceive in some hot, little puddle
with all sorts of prebiotic amino acids and

00:41:23.860 --> 00:41:29.120
nucleobases, lipids for membranes, phosphoric
salts, light, heat, electricity is present."

00:41:29.120 --> 00:41:33.800
So that is really the experiment I'm gonna
tell you about. Here's the recipe. This is

00:41:33.800 --> 00:41:41.430
what we're gonna put into a hot, little puddle.
Gotta have four amino acids. Four nucleobases.

00:41:41.430 --> 00:41:46.430
One gram each. Phosphate. Glycerol. Myrisytic
acid. That's this thing here.

00:41:46.430 --> 00:41:51.400
It's an amphiphilicampiphilic, soap-like molecule
that's our membrane-forming material. Then

00:41:51.400 --> 00:41:56.580
we can just pull out samples every hour for
several days. And we're gonna ask whether

00:41:56.580 --> 00:42:03.890
self-assembly can occur and whether any interesting
synthesis can happen. And here's what we found

00:42:03.890 --> 00:42:04.890
out.

00:42:04.890 --> 00:42:09.750
Let me just show you what it looks like. This
is Darwin's hot, little puddle. That's a boiling

00:42:09.750 --> 00:42:18.910
area right in the center. That's about 97
degrees, 93 degrees at this altitude. And

00:42:18.910 --> 00:42:24.680
this is clay down, this guy here. Here's the
clay is down there, so a lot of volcanism

00:42:24.680 --> 00:42:26.300
produces clay.

00:42:26.300 --> 00:42:32.740
And up there, we have fluctuating wet-dry
cycles. And keep that in mind. I think that's

00:42:32.740 --> 00:42:38.540
really important 'cause at the edges of pools
like this, is sometimes gonna get wet, sometimes

00:42:38.540 --> 00:42:45.000
gonna get dry. Wet-dry on an hourly basis,
daily basis. So this is a place where interesting

00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:46.780
chemistry can occur.

00:42:46.780 --> 00:42:52.810
And what we're gonna ask first though is can
self-assembly of membranes can occur? So here

00:42:52.810 --> 00:42:59.410
I am pouring a primordial soup, prebiotic
soup, into Darwin's hot, little puddle. Notice

00:42:59.410 --> 00:43:04.070
it's white. The reason it's white same reason
this is white. It's got membranes in it.

00:43:04.070 --> 00:43:10.620
It's got the lipid, the myristic[murcytic]
acid. And what I want to show you now is the

00:43:10.620 --> 00:43:17.970
same thing about an hour later. And with apologies
to Michelangelo and the Sistine Chapel, I

00:43:17.970 --> 00:43:20.300
think that this is where life began.

00:43:20.300 --> 00:43:21.300
[laughter]

00:43:21.300 --> 00:43:26.760
So that white stuff that you see, the white
scum, is self-assembled membranes. So I'm

00:43:26.760 --> 00:43:33.740
satisfied that I can make at least compartments
in a thing way outside the laboratory.

00:43:33.740 --> 00:43:37.771
This is very comforting to me anyway. And
my colleagues think I'm a little bit crazy

00:43:37.771 --> 00:43:41.940
for doing this sort of thing, but that's OK.
I'm at a point where I don't mind being a

00:43:41.940 --> 00:43:47.250
little bit crazy. So here we are now with
this membranes. And what we wanna do now,

00:43:47.250 --> 00:43:52.640
though, is to see if the membranes can do
any good in terms of polymerization.

00:43:52.640 --> 00:43:59.140
So, that brings me to the last part of my
talk. So this shows you close-up what we know

00:43:59.140 --> 00:44:04.440
membranes are produced by at the molecular
an electron level. Down at the bottom, you

00:44:04.440 --> 00:44:09.550
see a phospholipid and a cholesterol. And
this is what is in the membranes of every

00:44:09.550 --> 00:44:10.550
cell of your body.

00:44:10.550 --> 00:44:15.420
A hundred trillion cells, every one of them
has a membrane around it, made out of those

00:44:15.420 --> 00:44:21.050
two components. This is what the prebiotic
membranes are made out of. There's that fatty

00:44:21.050 --> 00:44:27.380
acid, or soap, that I've been telling you
about. So this is what a lipid bilayer looks

00:44:27.380 --> 00:44:28.890
like close-up.

00:44:28.890 --> 00:44:33.800
This is a model from Andrew Pohorille Pohorille,
right here at NASA Ames, who does this kind

00:44:33.800 --> 00:44:39.290
of modeling. And you can see that there is
an oily center. This is a cross-section through

00:44:39.290 --> 00:44:44.960
the membrane. There's an oily center composed
of hydrocarbon chains, hydrophilic groups

00:44:44.960 --> 00:44:47.950
on either side, in contact with water.

00:44:47.950 --> 00:44:52.830
So, that's what a membrane looks like, the
lipid component. So keep that in mind because

00:44:52.830 --> 00:44:59.840
you're gonna see that again as we go on. Last
point to make before I get to the molecular

00:44:59.840 --> 00:45:09.160
biology is that a property of vesicles is
that when they fuse, they turn into a multilamellar

00:45:09.160 --> 00:45:13.500
matrix--what we call a lipid matrix array.

00:45:13.500 --> 00:45:19.390
And anything that is outside becomes trapped
between those layers. And you can see them

00:45:19.390 --> 00:45:24.940
trapped, the little pink lines there. When
you rehydrate, you get the stuff back and

00:45:24.940 --> 00:45:29.600
now it's inside the vesicles. Some of the
vesicles have stuff inside. To prove that

00:45:29.600 --> 00:45:37.050
to you, there's an image of what we call freeze-fracture
electromicroscopy.

00:45:37.050 --> 00:45:40.910
There's some vesicles on the left and you
can see they're about the size of bacteria--about

00:45:40.910 --> 00:45:48.690
two microns. When you dry them they turn into
that dry multilamellar lipid phase. And that

00:45:48.690 --> 00:45:54.360
is what we believe is able to trap. Anything
that's outside gets trapped between those

00:45:54.360 --> 00:45:56.910
lipid lamellasr you see on the right.

00:45:56.910 --> 00:46:04.260
To prove that to you, we put some DNA in with
some vesicles, put it through a single dry-down

00:46:04.260 --> 00:46:10.250
ied-out, rehydration. All those bright fluorescent
is stained DNA inside the vesicles. It was

00:46:10.250 --> 00:46:16.030
all outside to begin with. So this just demonstrates
how powerful it is.

00:46:16.030 --> 00:46:20.990
That's through a single wet-dry cycle you
get these protocells. Same thing I just did

00:46:20.990 --> 00:46:27.820
for you here. OK, now a little bit of biochemistry.
I'm gonna try to keep it as simple as I can

00:46:27.820 --> 00:46:33.610
for those of you who haven't had biochemistry.
This is adenosine monophosphate. It's one

00:46:33.610 --> 00:46:39.570
of the four monomers of DNA and also one of
the four monomers of RNA.

00:46:39.570 --> 00:46:45.800
That's what it looks like. This blue and black
thing upper left is adenine. The black and

00:46:45.800 --> 00:46:51.460
red thing in the middle is ribose. And the
little red and yellow thing is phosphate.

00:46:51.460 --> 00:46:57.990
Adenosine monophosphate. That is one of the
sub-unit monomers of all nucleic acids.

00:46:57.990 --> 00:47:03.590
So what we're gonna try to do is to get that
to polymerize under these conditions I've

00:47:03.590 --> 00:47:11.910
been telling you about. Here's a cartoon of
what we think is happening. There's the lipid

00:47:11.910 --> 00:47:18.580
bilayers I showed you. And look at that little
thin line. Those are all of the AMP molecules

00:47:18.580 --> 00:47:23.530
that have been flattened out and organized
between the lipid lamellae.

00:47:23.530 --> 00:47:28.660
And they're not just stuck there, by the way.
They're able to diffuse around because this

00:47:28.660 --> 00:47:35.630
is a liquid crystal. This is not solid. These
things are able to diffuse around in two dimensions.

00:47:35.630 --> 00:47:41.710
So, here's what I claim. I claim that every
time two of those come together, there's a

00:47:41.710 --> 00:47:48.340
chance for a water molecule to leave and produce
what is called an ester bond.

00:47:48.340 --> 00:47:53.150
That's what holds nucleic acids together.
Ester bonds. Very simple. You have a water

00:47:53.150 --> 00:47:58.450
molecule, make a chemical bond, and that if
you make it long enough, you make a DNA molecule,

00:47:58.450 --> 00:48:05.060
or an RNA molecule. So the question is whether
this organization can help that process along.

00:48:05.060 --> 00:48:11.390
Just another view of it. There it is up on
top, I should show you a solid glass where

00:48:11.390 --> 00:48:17.850
you just dry the AMP down without any liquid
present. It becomes a solid, glassy phase.

00:48:17.850 --> 00:48:22.430
It can't react because everything's stuck
in place. There's no diffusion. But if we

00:48:22.430 --> 00:48:28.540
do the same thing and organize it in a lipid
matrix, what can happen is that water can

00:48:28.540 --> 00:48:30.420
leave and stuff can polymerize.

00:48:30.420 --> 00:48:35.770
So that's the idea. If there are any organic
chemists in the audience, this would be of

00:48:35.770 --> 00:48:42.800
interest to you, almost to nobody else. This
is that mechanism that I told you for ester

00:48:42.800 --> 00:48:51.200
bond formation. Basically, we're reversing
hydrolysis. In hydrolysis of RNA, water is

00:48:51.200 --> 00:48:55.240
added to the ester bonds and you break it
down to the mononucleotides.

00:48:55.240 --> 00:49:01.130
And all we're doing is setting downup conditions
where water can leave the mononucleotides

00:49:01.130 --> 00:49:07.230
and produce RNA. Very simple. This is called
Fischer esterification, discovered a hundred

00:49:07.230 --> 00:49:12.600
years ago by a very famous German organic
chemist. There's a bunch of little resonance

00:49:12.600 --> 00:49:13.620
structures.

00:49:13.620 --> 00:49:19.410
The main thing is here at the bottom, you
got an ester bond. Water leaves and you can

00:49:19.410 --> 00:49:27.950
make an ester linkage. Does it work? The answer
is yes it does. In 2008, we published this

00:49:27.950 --> 00:49:36.370
paper and in it we showed that if you dried
outdown vesicles with monomers and cycle it

00:49:36.370 --> 00:49:42.700
up to seven cycles--wet-dry cycles--and at
elevated temperature, 85 degrees C, under

00:49:42.700 --> 00:49:46.880
these conditions you can make RNA molecules.

00:49:46.880 --> 00:49:53.770
Notice that upper left you can see cycles.
One. Three. Five. Six. Seven. Each cycle produces

00:49:53.770 --> 00:49:59.830
more and more of this stuff. And by the way,
those black, that black stuff is radioactive

00:49:59.830 --> 00:50:05.530
label. We've attached that to the end of these
RNA molecules with a little enzymatic step

00:50:05.530 --> 00:50:06.881
that you see off to the right.

00:50:06.881 --> 00:50:15.390
RNA in yellow at the top. Those enzymes had
a radioactive phosphate shows up in these

00:50:15.390 --> 00:50:24.050
gels that we can use to separate the product.
And notice also, what we call a ladder. At

00:50:24.050 --> 00:50:30.060
ten, twenty, thirty, forty, fifty, one hundred.
Those are known links of RNA.

00:50:30.060 --> 00:50:34.330
And if you look up at the hundred and bring
your eye across, some of those molecules we

00:50:34.330 --> 00:50:39.260
made are way up in the hundred range. This
is really long. Plenty long enough to make

00:50:39.260 --> 00:50:44.840
a ribozyme, for instance. So, everything else
you see there is individual experiments, very

00:50:44.840 --> 00:50:46.890
reproducible.

00:50:46.890 --> 00:50:51.801
We just varied the conditions. And it's not
very interesting except to say that it's a

00:50:51.801 --> 00:50:57.070
robust reaction and it works. Here's the last
stuff I wanna tell you about. Just a few more

00:50:57.070 --> 00:51:06.060
slides. How did replication begin on the early
Earth? No one knows. We just don't have a

00:51:06.060 --> 00:51:07.350
way to think about this yet.

00:51:07.350 --> 00:51:15.530
But I think we have a lead into this. Maybe
replication can occur under the same conditions

00:51:15.530 --> 00:51:20.850
that I've talked about. So, we tried this
out. And a paper was published earlier this

00:51:20.850 --> 00:51:29.990
year. Paper by Felix Olasagasti, from the
Basque region of France. Kim and Pourmand.

00:51:29.990 --> 00:51:36.190
I'm the only American citizen in that particular
team, which is very common in university science.

00:51:36.190 --> 00:51:43.150
And look what we're claiming. Non-enzymatic
transfer of sequence information under plausible

00:51:43.150 --> 00:51:49.050
prebiotic conditions. That is a big, scary
claim. Until somebody repeats that, I don't

00:51:49.050 --> 00:51:50.350
want you to take this seriously.

00:51:50.350 --> 00:51:55.160
We're the only people that have done this
so far. We're hoping that other labs will

00:51:55.160 --> 00:52:01.790
pay attention and repeat it. If you're interested,
it came out in Biochiemie, 2010, very late

00:52:01.790 --> 00:52:11.380
in the year. Here's the idea. If you have
a solution of the four bases, A, G, T, and

00:52:11.380 --> 00:52:17.770
C, those little colored squares, in the presence
of the template and if all you do is dry it

00:52:17.770 --> 00:52:19.810
down, you get a glassy solid.

00:52:19.810 --> 00:52:26.550
Not much can happen because it just dries
out. The stuff cannot diffuse around. It cannot

00:52:26.550 --> 00:52:32.130
line up by what we call Watson-Crick base-pairing.
But, if you dry it in the presence of lipid,

00:52:32.130 --> 00:52:37.440
the stuff can move around and it has enough
time to find the complementary base-pairing

00:52:37.440 --> 00:52:44.750
between the yellow and blue, which is A and
T, and the red and green, which is the G and

00:52:44.750 --> 00:52:45.750
the C.

00:52:45.750 --> 00:52:50.080
You can see them all lined up there. And then,
because these conditions allow ester bond

00:52:50.080 --> 00:52:55.450
formation to occur, you zip up all of those
ester bonds and you end up with a double-stranded

00:52:55.450 --> 00:53:02.550
DNA that has transferred the sequence from
the template to the product strand.

00:53:02.550 --> 00:53:08.630
So, here's the formula for doing this. My
little recipe. Pretty simple. We're just simulating

00:53:08.630 --> 00:53:14.020
a fluctuating environment such as I've shown
you. We mix the DNA template about a 55mer.

00:53:14.020 --> 00:53:20.700
That means its got 55 nucleotides. We know
the sequence. It's got four nucleotides. A,

00:53:20.700 --> 00:53:22.640
T, G, and C.

00:53:22.640 --> 00:53:27.380
We have phospholipid vesicles. That's the
stuff that's gonna form that multilamellar

00:53:27.380 --> 00:53:34.450
matrix. Gonna dry it down under carbon dioxide.
Oxygen tends to inhibit this. Gonna give it

00:53:34.450 --> 00:53:40.190
about two hours at 85 degrees. We're gonna
add water, dry and heat again, repeat five

00:53:40.190 --> 00:53:41.190
times.

00:53:41.190 --> 00:53:46.670
Then see if there's any double-stranded DNA.
If we're right, we should see double-stranded

00:53:46.670 --> 00:53:54.550
DNA there. Furthermore, if we see it and ligate
the products together, sequence the products,

00:53:54.550 --> 00:53:59.480
and see whether any information is transferred
from the template to the product strand.

00:53:59.480 --> 00:54:05.960
And that's what we did. That last bit, by
the way, is very high-tech molecular biology.

00:54:05.960 --> 00:54:10.150
And I won't have time to go into it. Then
we gotta compare and we use bioinformatics

00:54:10.150 --> 00:54:17.970
techniques to compare the base sequence to
the expected sequence. DNA is synthesized.

00:54:17.970 --> 00:54:25.580
See that thing there that says complete system?
This is a fluorescence assay for double-stranded

00:54:25.580 --> 00:54:31.620
DNA when you have the complete system, you
get double-stranded DNA out of it as indicated

00:54:31.620 --> 00:54:36.830
by this fluorescent dye. We then took the
material and put it onto a gel.

00:54:36.830 --> 00:54:44.360
We did electrophoresis. And see that little,
clear to the right, 50 base pairs? That is

00:54:44.360 --> 00:54:49.480
in the range of our template. And you can
see that we have a double-stranded DNA showing

00:54:49.480 --> 00:54:54.820
up in the gel in that 50 base pair region.
So we're pretty sure now that we've not only

00:54:54.820 --> 00:54:57.900
made double-stranded, but that we can separate
it.

00:54:57.900 --> 00:55:06.450
So, we've isolated that double-stranded material,
ligated it, did a sequence analysis, and finally

00:55:06.450 --> 00:55:13.820
compared alignment scores. If all we had made
is random fragments of DNA, it would've shown

00:55:13.820 --> 00:55:19.030
up on the left side of these alignment scores,
where there's virtually no alignment at all.

00:55:19.030 --> 00:55:25.540
As the alignment score increases, that means
that we have sequenced information transferred.

00:55:25.540 --> 00:55:30.430
So, all of that product that you see there
is our product sequence. And those are big

00:55:30.430 --> 00:55:35.980
alignment scores. They're up at the point
where we have only about a ten percent error

00:55:35.980 --> 00:55:39.210
in transfer of information of these thinbetween
strands.

00:55:39.210 --> 00:55:45.790
So, that is the main thing you should take
away from this. We know that adding lipid

00:55:45.790 --> 00:55:51.640
gives sufficient complexity to allow RNA synthesis.
They become ordered within that array that

00:55:51.640 --> 00:55:56.290
I showed you. And the DNA template is present.
We can get sequence information transferred.

00:55:56.290 --> 00:56:02.670
The next question is how do we get this system
to evolve? Nobody knows how to do that yet.

00:56:02.670 --> 00:56:08.030
That's where we are. We've had a few steps,
though. Jack Szostak, my colleague back at

00:56:08.030 --> 00:56:15.960
Harvard, is taking interest in this. He's
gotten a partial DNA to occur inside a fatty

00:56:15.960 --> 00:56:23.600
acid vesicle under conditions where an activated
monomer can get across the membrane, add itself

00:56:23.600 --> 00:56:27.580
to that partial DNA to complete the double-helix.

00:56:27.580 --> 00:56:33.040
And then, those large vesicles can divide
into smaller vesicles. So, that's about where

00:56:33.040 --> 00:56:37.510
we are now in the search for how life began
and how to simulate it in the laboratory.

00:56:37.510 --> 00:56:38.510
Thanks for your attention.

00:56:38.510 --> 00:56:38.700
[applause]
