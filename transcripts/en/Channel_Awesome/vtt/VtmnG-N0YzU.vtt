Narrator: "Once, there was a tree, and she loved a little boy."

00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:07.880
"Every day, the boy would come and say:"

00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:11.300
Boy: "Gosh, I love you, tree! Let's be together forever."

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:17.920
Tree: "Why, that would be lovely, child, and I will be always be here for you."

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:21.760
Narrator: "The boy loved the tree, and the tree was happy."

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:27.900
"But time went by, and the tree got older, and the tree was often alone."

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:33.700
"Then, one day, the boy came to the tree, and the tree said:"

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:37.880
Tree: "Come, boy. Come climb up my trunk and swing--"

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:41.120
*tree screams*

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:42.320
"What are you doing?!"

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:44.780
*tree grunts*

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.360
*tree pants*

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:49.980
"Why boy, why have you done this to me?"

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:53.160
"Wait, what is that, what is that?"

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:56.780
"No! No, no no no, think of the memories we had, why wont you--"

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:04.120
*tree screams in agony*

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:06.280
*thunder*

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:13.180

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:54.360
Evil Redhead: "Who invited the giant furry peanut?"

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:55.660
Lorax: "I'll go right up your nose!"

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:57.300
Once-ler: "Woah! You wouldn't hurt a woman!"

00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:58.960
Lorax: "That's a woman?"

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:05.640
*viewers laugh*

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.740
Critic: "I am the Critic. I speak for the Seuss."

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:14.520
"Observing how all this BULLSHIT got loose."

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:20.740
"The Lorax, a book that was read by a ton, has been ripped into shreds and can't be undone."

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:28.100
"The timelessly writen book of all ages, succumbs to the dumb of the focus group cases!"

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:31.780
*analysts laugh*

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:35.340
Critic: "Well I'm standing for the small, hairy orange, I'm going up there and--"

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:37.160
"You know, I'm done rhyming."

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:40.780
*peaceful music plays*

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:43.320
Analyst Malcolm: "To the Lorax being a huge hit."

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:47.960
Analyst Rob: "Yes, now let's see if we can make a live action version of 'Goodnight Moon', starring Madea."

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:52.440
*Cinema Sins sound*

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:57.820
Analyst Rob: "Oh great, another pep talk from the Seuss nazi, or as I like to call them, "Seussis"

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:01.380
Critic: "You think you can get away with dumbing down Dr. Seuss, like you did with 'Cat in the Hat' and 'The Grinch'!"

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:03.940
"Follow-up question: Didn't I kill you two?"

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:06.980
Analyst Rob: "We're like mononucleosis. We never fully go away."

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:08.940
Analyst Malcolm: "And, we often put you to sleep."

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:12.580
Critic: "Don't you see the harm you're doing to the  wonderful world Dr. Seuss created?"

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:14.100
Analyst Malcolm: "The box office disagrees."

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:15.560
Analyst Rob: "Indeed, the people love it."

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:16.160
*toast to greed!*

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:20.900
Critic: "But that's what's making it worse! Do I have to show you the obvious problems you're causing?"

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:23.980
Analyst Malcolm: "No, but I get the feeling you're going to anyway.

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:25.020
Critic: "This is The Lorax."

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:27.300
*analysts sigh*

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:33.580
Critic: "We open in Thneedville as the credits roll, a town made completely out of plastic and where no trees exist at all."

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:39.380
Villagers: ♪ "Thneedville! It's a brand new dawn!" ♪

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:46.180
Critic: *sighs* "I'd like to thank this film for making me realise how sick I am for over-the-top upbeat musical intros."

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:48.700
"Sorry, opening to 'The Muppets Movie', I have to hate you now."

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:49.960
*crowd booing*

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:51.340
Critic: "Blame this movie!"

00:03:52.380 --> 00:04:00.440
"So we see a GAP Kids commercial meet up with a Abercrombie and Fitch commercial, voiced by timeless acting giants Zac Efron and Taylor Swift."

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:01.720
Audrey: "Oh, hi Ted!"

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:05.060
Ted: "Oh, hey Audrey, hi."

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:09.900
Critic: "Wow, that is not the voice I expected to come out of that kid."

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:15.520
"You know, because a 12 year old boy should always be voiced by a 26 year old man, right?"

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:20.520
Ted: "Alright! Cool, hey I got to run, I got to go do things, so, I'll see you guys."

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:22.420
Critic: "I'm pretty sure it's how they did it in 'The Iron Giant', isn't it?

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:25.920
Hogarth Hughes (pharyngealized): "Hey Dean! Watch this!"

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:27.820
"BONZAI!"

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:34.880
*freezing* "Come on in! The water's great!"

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:36.560
Dean McCoppin: "No thanks."

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:38.900
Hogarth: "You weenie!"

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:44.840
Critic: "It turns out that this girl is an artist, who paints pictures of trees, and dreams one day being able to see a real one."

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:48.060
Ted: "If a guy, somehow get you one --?

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:49.940
Audrey: "Well, I'll probably marry him on the spot."

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:53.540
"I bet that sounds crazy. Does that sound crazy?"

00:04:54.560 --> 00:05:00.660
Critic: "Well, that depends! Do you mean it literally, or do you have a good sense of humor, or-- nothing else is going to revealed about you in the movie, is it?"

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:07.080
"You're just a bland piece of who-ass to get his Truffula growing so he can set out on this movie's hypocritical quest. Aren't you?"

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:12.060
Audrey: "And people said, that the touch of their tufts, was softer than anything!".

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:18.160
Critic: "Well, any other cliché characters, or as I like to call them, 'cliché-acers', you'd like to get out early in the movie?"

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:19.660
*Grammy Norma blows kiss*

00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:21.400
Critic (kewl voice): "The hip rocking granny!"

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:22.440
Critic (normal): "Okay, okay, any others?"

00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:24.860
Ted's mother: "Disco!"

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:26.860
Critic (goofy): "The embarrassing parent!"

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:28.860
Critic (normal): "Painful, very painful, any others?"

00:05:29.140 --> 00:05:33.020
O'Hare: "The more smog in the sky, the more people will buy!"

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:43.580
Critic: "Oh, of course, the corperate bad guy who owns the town with no redeeming elements whatsoever! You could call him the missing Captain Planet villain, Shempy!"

00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:48.080
Marketing Agent: "How can I possibly make even more money?! Haha, we can tell ya, sir! We can tell ya!"

00:05:48.140 --> 00:05:54.820
Critic: "Why, he's so evil, he wants to actually sell fresh air to people because their pollution is already destroying the air that they have."

00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:58.240
"Umm, Spaceballs did it?"

00:05:58.940 --> 00:06:03.820
O'Hare: "I make a living, selling fresh air to people. Trees? Oh, they make it for free."

00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:07.540
"I consider it kind of a threat to my business."

00:06:07.540 --> 00:06:11.120
Critic: "Okay, first of all, if you're going steal Edna Mode's design sheet, pick a voice that matches."

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:12.980
"Those vocals match about as well as:"

00:06:12.980 --> 00:06:14.200
Ted: "Oh, hey, Audrey."

00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:24.840
Critic: "THAT. Second, isn't the idea of The Lorax that there is no real bad guy, it's just a cautionary tale of when someone, anyone takes too much without seeing it?

00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:30.820
Once-ler: "Unless someone like you cares a whole lot, nothing's going to get better. It's not."

00:06:31.300 --> 00:06:35.600
Analyst Rob: "But, you don't understand! We don't want people to feel bad about themselves.

00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:39.080
Analyst Malcolm: "Yes, people are less likely to buy things when they feel bad.

00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:44.720
Analyst Rob: "It's easier to show a clear right-and-wrong message so that no kids are confused!"

00:06:45.480 --> 00:06:50.580
Critic: "But, maybe they should be confused. Hell, maybe what you're doing is confusing them in a different way. Look!"

00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:59.460
"When you make your characters less human, you suck out the humanity, meaning people are less likely to see what they could become."

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.280
Girl: "Daddy, could that be me?"

00:07:02.460 --> 00:07:05.260
Father: "No, kiddo. He's evil. You're good!"

00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:07.280
Girl: "Oh, okay!"

00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:11.840
Guy 1: "Man, I'm glad I'm not so evil as that guy!"

00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:12.360
Guy 2: "Yeah."

00:07:17.200 --> 00:07:22.220
Critic: "Just like a delicate seed can grow a great oak, so can a faulty message grow a big problem."

00:07:23.700 --> 00:07:28.140
Analyst Malcolm: "Yes, but clearly we show it in a satirical sense, so that it makes it alright."

00:07:28.140 --> 00:07:28.960
*a toast to satirical sense*

00:07:28.960 --> 00:07:29.900
Critic: "In what way?"

00:07:29.900 --> 00:07:32.700
"How does laughing at the bad things you do make it any less bad?"

00:07:36.520 --> 00:07:37.460
Analyst Rob: "Well, the chart says--"

00:07:37.460 --> 00:07:37.960
Critic: "FORGET IT!"

00:07:38.780 --> 00:07:42.500
"So, Mini-Trump watches the boy leave the town to find a tree,

00:07:42.500 --> 00:07:44.500
leading him, of course, to the home of the Once-ler."

00:07:49.300 --> 00:07:53.140
"Well, there went the surprise of the powerful line that closed out the original."

00:07:53.140 --> 00:07:56.080
"Oh, fuck it. I'm just going to assume nothing in this film is going to move me at all."

00:07:56.080 --> 00:07:57.840
Analyst Rob: "It's really the best way to watch it."

00:07:58.100 --> 00:08:01.420
*Ted pants*

00:08:01.520 --> 00:08:04.460
Old Once-ler: "Who are you? Who are you and what are you doing here?"

00:08:04.640 --> 00:08:06.640
Critic: "My God, they finally found Bill Watterson!"

00:08:06.640 --> 00:08:07.520
Ted: "Woah!"

00:08:07.520 --> 00:08:12.460
Old Once-ler: "You want to know about trees? About what happened to them? Why they're all gone."

00:08:12.800 --> 00:08:25.000
Critic: "So, the Once-ler of course, tells the story of about what happened to all the trees, naturally keeping his face hidden throughout the story, so like I said before, he can represent how this can happen to anyone. Anyone watching right now--"

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:27.340
"Fuck you! Fuck you! Fuck you!"

00:08:27.340 --> 00:08:30.240
"FUCK YOU, FUCK YOU, FUCK YOU, FUCK YOU, FUCK YOU, FUCK YOU, FUCK YOU, FUCK YOU!!"

00:08:31.380 --> 00:08:41.000
"Maybe I'm over exaggerating. After all, it is a hour and a half long movie, an hour and a half is a long is a long time to go without seeing your... kinda main character."

00:08:41.200 --> 00:08:55.060
"I mean, it's an adaptation. I got it, there's going to have to be changes from an adaptation, fair enough. At the very least they're making him timeless, somebody that anyone can look back years later, and not laugh at so incredibly dated and dumb--"

00:08:55.060 --> 00:09:00.700
Once-ler: "Gonna chop one down and make my Thneed!"

00:09:00.700 --> 00:09:02.460
Critic: "fffffffffff--"

00:09:02.460 --> 00:09:02.960
Critic: "fffffffffff-f

"I don't care for that."

00:09:14.500 --> 00:09:28.420
"This Once-ler is a super young, electric guitar playing, tight-clothes wearing, fedora-hat-toting, pop-culture-referencing, Zach Braff...ing, completely dated product of the times.

00:09:28.680 --> 00:09:40.580
Once-ler: "Na na nanana na! Oh, I got a little jingle. Uh... no... Gonna blow some minds. Whoop-a-dee-po-pow! Yeah. See? Uh, yea-n-uh, no. What's his problem? I'm just sayin'. Weirdo."

00:09:40.640 --> 00:09:43.080
Critic: "bull-fucking-shit."

00:09:43.280 --> 00:09:46.040
Analyst Malcolm: "Yes, and the Once-lings seem to love him."

00:09:47.140 --> 00:09:47.840
Critic: "The what?"

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:55.800
Analyst Rob: "The Once-lings. Apparently our character was so 'hip with the ladies', that they decided to form a online community around him!"

00:09:56.480 --> 00:09:57.120
"Engage."

00:09:58.840 --> 00:10:00.840
Critic: "Oh my god, this was a thing?"

00:10:01.180 --> 00:10:06.480
Analyst Malcolm: "Yes, and we have one online right now. She calls her self 'HyperFanGirl'

00:10:07.980 --> 00:10:16.340
HyperFanGirl: "Oh, my, god, guys! I just love all the emo-haircuts you're giving to the Dr. Seuss characters! You're giving them a style that'll last forever, like the Jonas Brothers!"

00:10:16.460 --> 00:10:24.020
Critic: "Why do you love this Once-ler? He's every other quirky alternative product mixed into a Michael Cera action figure. They should have called him 'The Hipster'!"

00:10:24.020 --> 00:10:24.900
Analysts: "Ooh!"

00:10:25.340 --> 00:10:33.160
HyperFanGirl: "He is clearly not a hipster. Hipsters act like they don't care how they look, and they take 7 hours to put their outfits together. He clearly only took six."

00:10:33.380 --> 00:10:39.460
Critic: "You can't just like someone because he's really nerdy, into retro media, wears a bunch of half-professional half grunchy cloth--"

*Romeo and Juliet Overture plays*

Critic: "SHUT UP!"

00:10:57.020 --> 00:11:01.560
"So the Once-ler--" *fangirls scream* "Oh, shut up, comes across a land full of trees and--"

Critic: "As he starts to chop them all down for his new business."

00:11:14.280 --> 00:11:22.640
Old Once-ler: "Little did I know, that by chopping down that tree, I had just summoned a mystical creature as old as time itself."

00:11:22.680 --> 00:11:24.680
Critic: "The Danny DeVito cameo!"

00:11:25.560 --> 00:11:31.220
"Of course, The Lorax is in one of the trees, as all characters circle around the chopped down life to mourn its loss."

00:11:31.220 --> 00:11:40.720
*music plays*

00:11:40.800 --> 00:11:52.540
"Now that's actually a very touching moment that fits the spirit of the book. It's new, it's different, but it keeps the message, love and even kind of subtlety of what Seuss was going for."

00:11:53.700 --> 00:11:54.720
"How do they fuck it up?"

00:11:55.720 --> 00:12:00.620
"Well, clearly we can make the message much more powerful by adding in Mission Impossible hommages."

00:12:00.660 --> 00:12:03.760
*fish sing Mission Impossible music*

00:12:03.960 --> 00:12:06.120
"A dozen more of those Minion moments!"

00:12:06.120 --> 00:12:09.780
*fish singing*

00:12:09.780 --> 00:12:10.540
Minion: "Bottom."

00:12:10.540 --> 00:12:12.720
*Minions laugh*

00:12:12.720 --> 00:12:19.140
Critic: "And the non-violent pacifist Lorax of the original now tried to drown our hero in the hopes that that'll lead him away."

00:12:19.300 --> 00:12:22.740
"Oh, and don't forget a few more of those lame-ass pop cultural references."

00:12:22.780 --> 00:12:26.720
Old-Once-ler: "Why aren't you like other kids, break dancing and playing the Donkey Kongs."

00:12:28.700 --> 00:12:31.860
Critic: "So Donkey Kong is now officially part of the Dr. Seuss canon?"

00:12:33.600 --> 00:12:34.700
"I don't know how to feel about that."

00:12:34.700 --> 00:12:37.300
HyperFanGirl: "I know, it's so retro. Hold me!"

00:12:42.029 --> 00:12:47.399
the once-ler so we make it up to him by
tearing the shit out of his new home

00:12:47.399 --> 00:12:50.399
it was cold outside we just fell asleep

00:12:50.399 --> 00:12:55.019
ok i put my lips on the new what's for
breakfast

00:12:55.949 --> 00:12:59.459
breakfast is over rated and why do you
have one of these

00:13:00.089 --> 00:13:03.720
you don't even have a Mustang yes
teaching lessons about staying out of

00:13:03.720 --> 00:13:08.040
others environment has made stronger by
invading your environment that I got

00:13:08.040 --> 00:13:08.790
work to do

00:13:08.790 --> 00:13:16.470
yep I gotta go into town and sell my
knee so the once-ler pal yo makes a deal

00:13:16.470 --> 00:13:20.100
with the lorax that he won't cut down
any more trees and that the one he got

00:13:20.100 --> 00:13:23.379
is enough to sell his product called the
need

00:13:23.379 --> 00:13:24.810
yeah

00:13:24.810 --> 00:13:31.230
cool had my god i totally want one that
thing makes me like you more

00:13:31.830 --> 00:13:36.120
ah how advertisers thought marketing for
the large would work and certainly did

00:13:36.120 --> 00:13:39.120
work

00:13:43.740 --> 00:13:48.720
and there went my enjoyment for the
update lego movie song . as will be

00:13:48.720 --> 00:13:53.490
insolent may be realized with being over
yo i should point out that it does

00:13:53.490 --> 00:13:57.210
sometimes cut back to our main lead
still suffering from blam millennial

00:13:57.210 --> 00:14:01.290
itís but they're so rushed and so
generic that you forget about them just

00:14:01.290 --> 00:14:02.940
as soon as you watch them

00:14:02.940 --> 00:14:07.350
I think the most that happens is all my
own paint over flower girls artwork

00:14:07.350 --> 00:14:11.940
why wasn't even supposed to accomplish
is that really gonna make such a big

00:14:11.940 --> 00:14:12.990
difference

00:14:12.990 --> 00:14:17.070
it's kind of like saying all you want to
see Elsa and Jack Frost together well

00:14:17.070 --> 00:14:20.760
what if we just put a drag acts over
your fat art now you'll never ever want

00:14:20.760 --> 00:14:23.370
to see them again as long as you live
with you way over

00:14:23.370 --> 00:14:26.970
did you damage my fanart still love you

00:14:33.379 --> 00:14:36.320
yeah

00:14:36.320 --> 00:14:39.320
yeah

00:14:41.279 --> 00:14:44.279
yeah

00:14:45.440 --> 00:14:49.610
so what's good family comes out to live
with him and once again it's not the

00:14:49.610 --> 00:14:53.390
once-ler himself who is consumed by
productivity that would make an

00:14:53.390 --> 00:14:55.940
interesting identifiable and complex

00:14:55.940 --> 00:15:01.370
no it's just as evil family that eggs
and mine so i guess as long as you don't

00:15:01.370 --> 00:15:03.980
have one of those this could never
happen to you

00:15:03.980 --> 00:15:08.630
we could always start chopping down the
trees but no buts one seat you're

00:15:08.630 --> 00:15:12.590
running a business now you have to do
what's best for the company and your

00:15:12.590 --> 00:15:13.490
mama

00:15:13.490 --> 00:15:17.780
even his progression seems hastily
rushed the original was good at showing

00:15:17.780 --> 00:15:21.770
the ones like tube8 himself but then
always find an excuse to keep going

00:15:21.770 --> 00:15:25.940
bigger and even the story never claimed
that going to another extreme was the

00:15:25.940 --> 00:15:26.840
answer

00:15:26.840 --> 00:15:31.700
morning on I should shut down my factory
fire a hundred thousand workers

00:15:32.240 --> 00:15:35.420
I see your point and then I wouldn't
know the answer

00:15:35.420 --> 00:15:39.170
it was trying to find that middle row
that wasn't victimless but was the best

00:15:39.170 --> 00:15:41.720
compromise we could come up with here

00:15:41.720 --> 00:15:44.720
one song it Oh overnight girls out there

00:15:45.880 --> 00:15:51.640
just building the instead of slowly but
surely over the course of the film we

00:15:51.640 --> 00:15:55.720
see the progression of all these choices
and the effect that is having its just

00:15:55.720 --> 00:15:56.590
one song

00:15:56.590 --> 00:16:03.910
Anakin Skywalker's transition was more
complex and then there's your allegory

00:16:03.910 --> 00:16:05.020
for the movie right there

00:16:05.020 --> 00:16:08.140
just take a picture with the lorax on
your product and boom it's not only

00:16:08.140 --> 00:16:11.920
likes approved around like this song
it's against everything corporate when

00:16:11.920 --> 00:16:14.620
that's exactly what the lawrence
marketing was doing

00:16:14.620 --> 00:16:17.710
enjoy your air polluting car the lorax
says it's okay

00:16:19.960 --> 00:16:26.200
on top of that i did notice that out of
the five songs in this movie only one is

00:16:26.200 --> 00:16:32.110
pro trees and it's only played at the
end and yes i know they're being ironic

00:16:32.110 --> 00:16:37.690
and praising over productivity but by
god for upbeat modern style pop songs

00:16:37.690 --> 00:16:43.120
about it and only one fucking one song
that actually says give a damn about the

00:16:43.120 --> 00:16:44.050
trees

00:16:44.050 --> 00:16:47.080
don't you see even a little bit of a
problem with that

00:16:47.080 --> 00:16:53.590
it is the people with the money go round
the night and timeless songs they all

00:16:53.590 --> 00:16:58.090
sound like the top 10 from Radio Disney
when we're just trying to reach the most

00:16:58.090 --> 00:17:00.850
popular demographic you can respect that

00:17:00.850 --> 00:17:04.209
trying to get your message out to as
many people as possible. A toast to

00:17:04.209 --> 00:17:04.900
pandering!

00:17:04.900 --> 00:17:08.199
yeah but the popular way isn't always
the lasting way

00:17:08.199 --> 00:17:10.870
look again

00:17:10.870 --> 00:17:15.100
fad is just one letter away from fade
and that's exactly what they do they

00:17:15.100 --> 00:17:16.540
fade away

00:17:16.540 --> 00:17:20.230
that's why it's better to focus on being
good rather than being popular

00:17:20.230 --> 00:17:23.350
if you can be both great but if you have
to choose one over the other

00:17:23.350 --> 00:17:27.550
always pick good / popular because once
the people grow out of it and move on to

00:17:27.550 --> 00:17:29.020
the next popular thing

00:17:29.020 --> 00:17:32.530
there's nothing of substance to bring
them back and the time was message you

00:17:32.530 --> 00:17:39.190
claim to fight so hard for becomes just
another passing trend to forget about us

00:17:39.190 --> 00:17:41.380
okay the internet speeds up everything

00:17:41.380 --> 00:17:48.790
yes it will be popularly retro and five
minutes and synchronize so as I'm sure

00:17:48.790 --> 00:17:53.170
you get the once-ler finely chopped down
the last tree and his business as well

00:17:53.170 --> 00:17:55.750
as the forest is completely gone

00:17:55.750 --> 00:17:59.290
the lorax lips is a sin to have been
leaving even make obvious to be inspired

00:17:59.290 --> 00:18:03.070
to be the next big tyrant wonder what
the next million-dollar invention is

00:18:03.070 --> 00:18:04.480
gonna be

00:18:04.480 --> 00:18:07.510
yeah! I wonder...

00:18:08.140 --> 00:18:12.490
and of course you know how the rest of
the story goes the once-ler gives the

00:18:12.490 --> 00:18:17.050
boy the last seed and it's left up to
him as well as the children watching to

00:18:17.050 --> 00:18:21.070
make the choice on whether or not
they'll grow cleaner and better world

00:18:21.610 --> 00:18:25.540
leaving on a powerfully quiet
emotionally fueled and suddenly

00:18:25.540 --> 00:18:44.200
ambiguous final note... (*pauses for effect) HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!! back to the idea of
any dr. seuss movie doing anything

00:18:44.200 --> 00:18:49.540
clever subtle doors they don't do that

00:18:50.320 --> 00:18:54.100
NO! this one has "car chases"!

00:18:54.100 --> 00:18:57.130
yeah, because if there's anything that
people were complaining were missing

00:18:57.130 --> 00:19:00.340
from dr. Seuss if it was more fucking
car chases

00:19:00.340 --> 00:19:05.170
also we get the "big bad corporations"
trying to take control of the people's minds!

00:19:05.170 --> 00:19:05.970
brbrbrbr!

00:19:05.970 --> 00:19:09.720
by god! they're making hail Hydra
sound like a weather-resistant German

00:19:09.720 --> 00:19:10.380
car

00:19:10.380 --> 00:19:15.090
(o'Hare: YOU WON'T GET AWAY WITH THIS BOY!)  NC: Throw in a "radical snowboarding granny"

00:19:15.690 --> 00:19:21.480
(GingerSwift: SERIOUSLY! how cool is  your Grandma?!) NC: A "tubular scooter" that's probably polluting the more times he

00:19:21.480 --> 00:19:22.920
rides around on it!

00:19:22.920 --> 00:19:25.890
...Seriously you're just talking. Do you
have to ride around in circles like that?

00:19:25.890 --> 00:19:30.840
and we clearly see the town, not over the
progression of time and patience but

00:19:30.840 --> 00:19:35.520
rather fucking instantly join the
boy's side, go out to plant a million trees

00:19:35.520 --> 00:19:38.980
and sing another pop song about it

00:19:38.980 --> 00:19:42.580
(*Town singing "Let it Grow")

00:19:43.100 --> 00:19:47.760
Oh God people were satirizing it before
it even came out! HOW POPULAR IS THIS SONG?!

00:19:47.760 --> 00:19:51.490
we even see the lorax come back

00:19:51.490 --> 00:19:57.040
yep, he comes back. removing all the
weight of ambiguity and sense of urgency

00:19:57.040 --> 00:20:01.000
and instead gives the kids their happy
little ending

00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:04.480
you done good beanpole you done good

00:20:09.600 --> 00:20:10.800
(Sarcastically) Awwwww.

00:20:10.800 --> 00:20:14.860
isn't that just precious.... say while
you're at it why don't you just clarify

00:20:14.860 --> 00:20:17.260
that Bambi's mom never died

00:20:17.260 --> 00:20:20.620
yeah that was a bit of a downer. Why don't
you just clarify that she came back and

00:20:20.620 --> 00:20:22.360
they all lived happily ever after?

00:20:22.360 --> 00:20:26.170
Come to think of it, why don't you just
reveal whether or not the top falls over

00:20:26.170 --> 00:20:27.250
in Inception?

00:20:27.250 --> 00:20:31.270
or why don't you just tell us what Bill
Murray said to Scarlett Johansson?

00:20:31.270 --> 00:20:35.559
or give away what was in the briefcase in
Pulp Fiction? because that's what life is

00:20:35.559 --> 00:20:41.050
made up of right? Answers. Easy non
thought-provoking answers. and we need to

00:20:41.050 --> 00:20:46.320
prepare kids for just a fucking easy
life is going to be. Yeah, sure they made

00:20:46.400 --> 00:20:52.020
us think, but look at it this way: THEY MADE US THINK! AHHHHHHHHH!

00:20:52.140 --> 00:20:55.080
(Executive Rob): but thinking gives children unclear
answers

00:20:55.080 --> 00:20:58.360
NC: well maybe that's the idea god damn it!
Maybe the message will last longer

00:20:58.360 --> 00:21:02.740
because people keep coming back to think
about it! (Excutive Malcolm): No no no is our data has shown this

00:21:02.740 --> 00:21:05.770
has gone retro right about... (Rob): now

00:21:06.460 --> 00:21:15.040
surely all the people have retur... *wind blowing ironically)... eh, this sucks. my god that was the last Lorax

00:21:15.040 --> 00:21:15.790
movie fan

00:21:15.790 --> 00:21:18.120
(Malcolm) there's nothing left to exploit *clinks

00:21:18.120 --> 00:21:20.260
NC: yeah
that's because you've given them nothing

00:21:20.260 --> 00:21:23.690
challenging and thus nothing valuable to
keep coming back to

00:21:23.690 --> 00:21:28.100
while it's not as bad as the "Cat in the Hat" and the animation style

00:21:28.100 --> 00:21:32.029
is colorful, and lends its way to Seuss's
world better than live action

00:21:32.029 --> 00:21:36.409
the Lorax still sucks in capturing the
spirit of dr. Seuss

00:21:36.409 --> 00:21:40.070
instead of being poetic, it panders to
the mainstream. instead of having it

00:21:40.070 --> 00:21:43.909
speak to everyone, it paints extremes
that alienates the truth of the story

00:21:43.909 --> 00:21:48.200
and instead of being dark and subtle, it
knocks you on the head with this message

00:21:48.200 --> 00:21:52.490
ironically making it far less memorable.
people aren't going to be coming back

00:21:52.490 --> 00:21:56.179
because you gave them nothing that shows
you respect them as thinking people.

00:21:56.179 --> 00:21:58.009
You simplified it, made it easy

00:21:58.009 --> 00:22:01.610
so easy that nobody finds it fun
anymore I don't care how many movies you

00:22:01.610 --> 00:22:04.940
make how popular they are for the moment
but how often you keep missing the

00:22:04.940 --> 00:22:08.389
spirit of these great stories because no
matter what you do

00:22:08.389 --> 00:22:11.299
people are always going to keep
returning to the books of dr. Seuss that

00:22:11.300 --> 00:22:15.420
not only because they remember them but
because they're worth remembering.

00:22:15.420 --> 00:22:19.960
Malcolm: Critic, that's exactly what I wanted to hear
Rob: what?

00:22:19.960 --> 00:22:22.134
NC: what?

00:22:22.134 --> 00:22:26.000
Black Willy Wonka!?

00:22:26.800 --> 00:22:30.000
Black Willy Wonka: that's right it was me all along

00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:31.279
Rob: this
wasn't on your resume

00:22:31.279 --> 00:22:34.370
Black Willy Wonka: oh look a popular demographic you can
exploit

00:22:34.370 --> 00:22:38.600
Rob: ooh! wait! I have charts! I have a charts!

00:22:38.600 --> 00:22:41.020
BWW: come with me Critic.

00:22:41.040 --> 00:22:43.800
This is my black-wonka-vator!

00:22:43.800 --> 00:22:46.380
NC: Wow does it
go every way possible?

00:22:46.720 --> 00:22:51.010
BWW: yes every button goes a different
direction, and I've pressed them all except

00:22:51.010 --> 00:22:52.060
this one

00:22:52.060 --> 00:22:53.240
NC: what direction does that go

00:22:53.240 --> 00:22:55.060
BWW: Up

00:23:05.500 --> 00:23:08.240
NC: hey aren't those the people who saw the
movie

00:23:08.240 --> 00:23:09.780
BWW: sure are!

00:23:09.780 --> 00:23:11.500
NC: but... they're reading the book?

00:23:11.500 --> 00:23:13.480
I thought they were done with the Lorax.

00:23:13.480 --> 00:23:14.680
BWW: well you see critic

00:23:14.680 --> 00:23:17.800
that was part of my ultimate plan. NC: it was?

00:23:17.800 --> 00:23:23.650
BWW: yes you were right about seuss his books
will last forever but sometimes people

00:23:23.650 --> 00:23:25.150
take that for granted

00:23:25.150 --> 00:23:29.050
so what better way to remind them of
Seuss's power than making films that

00:23:29.050 --> 00:23:30.741
completely fucks them up

00:23:30.741 --> 00:23:33.700
NC: so the "Grinch",
the "Cat in the Hat", the "Lorax"

00:23:33.700 --> 00:23:35.900
they were all purposely terrible and
dated

00:23:35.900 --> 00:23:37.450
BWW: They needed to be popular so that

00:23:37.450 --> 00:23:40.870
everyone would see them but they also
need to be horrible so everyone would go

00:23:40.870 --> 00:23:45.160
back to remember just how good the
original stories were. true beauty never fades,

00:23:46.180 --> 00:23:48.687
you just need to be reminded of it once
in a while

00:23:48.687 --> 00:23:49.990
NC: and for discovering this I

00:23:49.990 --> 00:23:53.380
get your money making secrets as well as
a lifetime of happiness

00:23:53.380 --> 00:23:56.380
BWW: No! you get a button :D

00:24:02.150 --> 00:24:03.389
NC: thanks

00:24:03.389 --> 00:24:06.929
BWW: but critic don't forget what happened to
the man who got everything he always

00:24:06.929 --> 00:24:07.529
wanted

00:24:07.529 --> 00:24:08.780
NC: what happened?

00:24:08.800 --> 00:24:11.180
BWW: I killed him and stole all
of his possessions!

00:24:30.860 --> 00:24:33.860
*music*

00:24:50.100 --> 00:24:54.000
music

00:24:55.030 --> 00:24:56.140
music
