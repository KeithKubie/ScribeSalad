00:00:01.969 --> 00:00:03.103
&gt;&gt; Jon:  WELCOME BACK.

00:00:03.103 --> 00:00:06.607
EARLIER THIS WEEK, JORDAN
KLEPPER HE GAVE US PART ONE OF

00:00:06.607 --> 00:00:08.775
HIS COMPLETE COVERAGE OF THE
U.K. ELECTIONS.

00:00:08.775 --> 00:00:13.313
IN TONIGHT'S PART TWO, HE NOW
COMPLETES HIS COMPLETE COVERAGE

00:00:13.313 --> 00:00:13.914
COMPLETELY.

00:00:13.914 --> 00:00:15.115
JORDAN.

00:00:15.115 --> 00:00:17.951
&gt;&gt; LAST WEEK IN THE U.K., THE
CONSERVATIVE PARTY HAD A HUGE

00:00:17.951 --> 00:00:19.152
VICTORY.

00:00:19.152 --> 00:00:21.722
I ASSUME BY USING THE SAME WEDGE
ISSUES AMERICAN CONSERVATIVE

00:00:21.722 --> 00:00:23.257
CANDIDATES USE SO EXCERPTLY.

00:00:23.257 --> 00:00:27.828
&gt;&gt; WELL,  I DO BELIEVE LIFE
BEGINS AT CONCEPTION.

00:00:27.828 --> 00:00:29.229
&gt;&gt; GOVERNMENT-RUN HEALTH CARE.

00:00:29.229 --> 00:00:30.898
THIS IS WHAT I WOULD DO TO THAT
LAW.

00:00:30.898 --> 00:00:33.467
&gt;&gt; I THINK MARRIAGE IS BETWEEN
A MAN AND A WOMAN.

00:00:33.467 --> 00:00:35.002
&gt;&gt; HOW AM I GOING TO WIN?

00:00:35.002 --> 00:00:36.537
AND I SAID GUNS.

00:00:36.537 --> 00:00:40.274
&gt;&gt; OBVIOUSLY THESE SAME ISSUES
WOULD RESONATE IN BRITAIN.

00:00:40.274 --> 00:00:42.242
HOW IMPORTANT IS THE GUN ISSUE
FOR YOU?

00:00:42.242 --> 00:00:43.844
&gt;&gt; I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT IS.

00:00:43.844 --> 00:00:47.514
&gt;&gt; YOU DON'T HAVE ANY GUNS HERE?

00:00:47.514 --> 00:00:50.951
&gt;&gt; NO, DOES THAT UPSET YOU?

00:00:50.951 --> 00:00:51.718
&gt;&gt; YEAH, I MEAN, HOW DO YOU
SHOOT LEGISLATION

00:00:51.718 --> 00:00:52.286
YOU DON'T LIKE?

00:00:52.286 --> 00:00:53.320
&gt;&gt; WE VOTE IT DOWN.

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:54.388
&gt;&gt; IS SOCIALIZED MEDICINE
GETTING THROWN DOWN

00:00:54.388 --> 00:00:55.255
YOUR THROATS?
&gt;&gt; NO, WE ALREADY HAVE IT.

00:00:55.255 --> 00:00:56.456
&gt;&gt; HOW BIG OF AN ISSUE IS
ABORTION?

00:00:56.456 --> 00:00:57.090
&gt;&gt; THE MAIN PARTIES ARE ALL
THINKING THE SAME THING ON THAT.

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:57.724
&gt;&gt; WHAT ABOUT GAY MARRIAGE?

00:00:57.724 --> 00:00:58.992
&gt;&gt; THAT'S ALSO NOT A DEBATE.

00:00:58.992 --> 00:01:01.862
WE HAVE IT, AND NO ONE, IT'S ALL
FINE.

00:01:01.862 --> 00:01:06.266
&gt;&gt; SO  WHAT THE [BLEEP] DO YOU
GUYS TALK ABOUT?

00:01:06.266 --> 00:01:07.868
&gt;&gt; WE TALK ABOUT THE ECONOMY. WE
TALK ABOUT SOMETHING CALLED THE

00:01:07.868 --> 00:01:09.436
DEFICIT -- 
&gt;&gt; BORING.

00:01:09.436 --> 00:01:14.441
MAYBE POLITICAL CONSULTANT STEVE
MORGAN CAN TELL US WHY THEY'RE

00:01:14.441 --> 00:01:15.475
IGNORING THESE KEY ISSUES.

00:01:15.475 --> 00:01:16.777
&gt;&gt; WELL, I MEAN, WE WOULD ARGUE
WE DEAL WITH THE

00:01:16.777 --> 00:01:18.912
REAL ISSUES HERE AND THOSE ARE
NOT THOSE.

00:01:18.912 --> 00:01:21.381
&gt;&gt; IS THERE ANY PARTY OUT
THERE THAT'S TALKING ABOUT THE

00:01:21.381 --> 00:01:25.852
FUN, WILD CARD STUFF,
LIKE CLIMATE DENIERS OR

00:01:25.852 --> 00:01:26.853
ANTI-IMMIGRATION OR BIG FEARS
AND STUFF LIKE THAT?

00:01:26.853 --> 00:01:27.788
&gt;&gt; WELL, WE'VE
GOT ANTI-IMMIGRATION FROM THE

00:01:27.788 --> 00:01:32.993
UKIP PARTY.
&gt;&gt; UKIP? WHAT IS THAT?

00:01:32.993 --> 00:01:34.294
&gt;&gt; THE U.K. INDEPENDENCE PARTY.

00:01:34.294 --> 00:01:35.362
AND THEY'RE A VERY DANGEROUS
PARTY BECAUSE

00:01:35.362 --> 00:01:36.430
THEY'RE XENOPHOBIC.

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:39.232
THEY APPEAL TO THE WORST
ELEMENTS OF BRITISH SOCIETY.

00:01:39.232 --> 00:01:40.567
&gt;&gt; OKAY, THAT'S A PARTY I
UNDERSTAND.

00:01:40.567 --> 00:01:44.004
THAT SOUND LIKE GOOD OLD
AMERICAN CAMPAIGNING.

00:01:44.004 --> 00:01:48.241
BUT WAS UCIP CANDIDATE KIM ROSE
ABLE TO WALK THE FINE LINE

00:01:48.241 --> 00:01:51.345
BETWEEN EXPLOITING PEOPLE'S
FEARS AND BALD-FACED HATRED?

00:01:51.345 --> 00:01:52.879
&gt;&gt; YOU KNOW, WE'RE NOT RACIST.

00:01:52.879 --> 00:01:55.482
WE WANT TO STOP THE MASS
MIGRATION OF PEOPLE COMING INTO

00:01:55.482 --> 00:01:56.583
THIS COUNTRY.

00:01:56.583 --> 00:02:00.487
THEY'RE COMING OVER IN VAST
NUMBERS AND NOW YOU'VE GOT

00:02:00.487 --> 00:02:04.658
COMMUNITIES TAKING UP PARTS OF
THE TOWN WHICH ARE ALL FULL OF

00:02:04.658 --> 00:02:05.459
LIKE POLISH PEOPLE.

00:02:05.459 --> 00:02:06.827
&gt;&gt; SEE, HE'S NOT RACIST.

00:02:06.827 --> 00:02:09.162
HE JUST DOESN'T LIKE POLISH
PEOPLE.

00:02:09.162 --> 00:02:10.964
&gt;&gt; I'M NOT A RACIST. WHAT I'M
TRYING TO PROVE IS AN ACTUAL

00:02:10.964 --> 00:02:13.133
FACT, YOU KNOW, THIS ISN'T
ABOUT RACE.

00:02:13.133 --> 00:02:14.701
THIS IS ABOUT SPACE.

00:02:14.701 --> 00:02:16.003
ALL WE WANT IS OUR COUNTRY BACK.

00:02:16.003 --> 00:02:18.939
&gt;&gt; IF YOU'RE NOT REPEATEDLY
DEFENDING THE FACT THAT

00:02:18.939 --> 00:02:19.840
YOU'RE BEING CALLED A RACIST
OVER AND OVER AGAIN,

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:21.708
YOU'RE DOING SOMETHING WRONG.

00:02:21.708 --> 00:02:23.377
&gt;&gt; ABSOLUTELY, ABSOLUTELY, I AM
NOT.

00:02:23.377 --> 00:02:23.844
&gt;&gt; NOT RACIST! THAT'S WHAT I'M
SAYING.

00:02:23.844 --> 00:02:25.012
&gt;&gt; I AM NOT.

00:02:25.012 --> 00:02:25.879
&gt;&gt; I CAN'T THINK OF ANY REASON
WHY PEOPLE WERE CONFUSED

00:02:25.879 --> 00:02:28.849
ABOUT HIS POLICIES.

00:02:28.849 --> 00:02:30.851
&gt;&gt; I GOT IN TROUBLE FOR A HITLER
COMMENT.

00:02:30.851 --> 00:02:34.721
SO I QUOTED FROM THE BOOK OF
"MEIN KAMPF."

00:02:34.721 --> 00:02:36.723
&gt;&gt; THE NAZI REFERENCE, GOOD
IDEA.

00:02:36.723 --> 00:02:39.660
ALTHOUGH WE DON'T USUALLY
ACTUALLY QUOTE HILTLER.

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:42.596
SOUNDS LIKE HE WAS READY FOR
AMERICAN-STYLE POLITICS.

00:02:42.596 --> 00:02:43.430
HE JUST NEEDED A COUPLE OF
POINTERS FROM A PRO.

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:44.097
&gt;&gt; THEY'VE TAKEN AWAY OUR POLICE
FORCE.

00:02:44.097 --> 00:02:47.701
THEY'VE TAKEN AWAY OUR
ARMY.

00:02:47.701 --> 00:02:50.937
&gt;&gt; GIVE HER THE WORST-CASE
SCENARIO.

00:02:50.937 --> 00:02:53.507
&gt;&gt; THE WORST-CASE SCENARIO IS
THIS GREAT, GREAT COUNTRY WILL

00:02:53.507 --> 00:02:54.141
CEASE TO EXIST.

00:02:54.141 --> 00:02:54.941
&gt;&gt; NICE.

00:02:54.941 --> 00:02:55.909
&gt;&gt; YOU KNOW ABOUT THE U.K.
POLICIES?

00:02:55.909 --> 00:03:00.347
&gt;&gt; HIT HER WITH THE HUNDRED
YEARS OF DARKNESS.

00:03:00.347 --> 00:03:02.883
&gt;&gt; YEAH, IF WE DON'T GET OUT OF
THE E.U., OUR CHILDREN 

00:03:02.883 --> 00:03:04.951
AND OUR GRANDCHILDREN WILL HAVE
100 YEARS OF DARKNESS.

00:03:04.951 --> 00:03:06.053
&gt;&gt; THIS GUY WAS ON FIRE.

00:03:06.053 --> 00:03:08.088
BUT THEN HIS TOUGHEST CHALLENGE.

00:03:08.088 --> 00:03:11.458
SQUARING OFF WITH THE RIVAL
CANDIDATE FROM THE GREEN PARTY.

00:03:11.458 --> 00:03:15.562
&gt;&gt; YEAH LOOK, THE FACT IS, AT
THE END OF THE DAY,

00:03:15.562 --> 00:03:16.063
WE ARE THE ONLY PARTY THAT WANTS
A COMPLETE WITHDRAWAL FROM

00:03:16.063 --> 00:03:16.897
THE EUROPEAN UNION.

00:03:16.897 --> 00:03:17.898
&gt;&gt; WE UNDERSTAND THAT.

00:03:17.898 --> 00:03:18.665
&gt;&gt; AND I KNOW YOU CAN'T SEE
THAT.

00:03:18.665 --> 00:03:19.900
&gt;&gt; MAKE THE HITLER REFERENCE
AGAIN.

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:20.901
&gt;&gt; YEAH, HITLER IN
1942, IN "MEIN KAMPF" --

00:03:20.901 --> 00:03:23.103
&gt;&gt; GOOD!

00:03:23.103 --> 00:03:25.906
&gt;&gt; SAID THAT THEY WILL TAKE
AWAY OUR FREEDOM IN TINY,

00:03:25.906 --> 00:03:29.676
INTO PIECES.

00:03:29.676 --> 00:03:30.911
NOW THAT IS WHAT IS HAPPENING IN
THIS COUNTRY.

00:03:30.911 --> 00:03:32.179
&gt;&gt; BOOM! WALK AWAY. JUST, GOOD,
GOOD.

00:03:32.179 --> 00:03:37.384
&gt;&gt; ULTIMATELY, KIM ROSE ENDED UP
WITH A WHOPPING 13% OF THE VOTE,

00:03:37.384 --> 00:03:40.153
WHICH SEEMS LIKE WAY MORE THAN
HE DESERVED.

00:03:40.153 --> 00:03:43.056
AND ACTUALLY, IN THE TIME I
SPENT HERE IN BRITAIN, APART

00:03:43.056 --> 00:03:47.627
FROM THEIR TERRIBLE VERSION OF
BASEBALL, I WAS IMPRESSED WITH

00:03:47.627 --> 00:03:48.695
THEIR ELECTORAL SYSTEM.

00:03:48.695 --> 00:03:49.463
GUYS LIKE THIS ARE MAGINALIZED.

00:03:49.463 --> 00:03:51.798
THEY SPEND LITTLE ON THE
ELECTIONS.

00:03:51.798 --> 00:03:55.802
THEY HAD JUST SIX WEEKS TO
CAMPAIGN, AND THEIR NEWS MEDIA

00:03:55.802 --> 00:03:56.203
PROVIDES REASONABLY SOBER
ANALYSIS.

00:03:56.203 --> 00:03:58.004
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU.

00:03:58.004 --> 00:04:00.240
&gt;&gt; BUT THERE WAS STILL SOMETHING
THAT WAS BOTHERING ME.

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:01.074
WHAT WAS IT.

00:04:01.074 --> 00:04:02.642
&gt;&gt; ARE YOU FAMILIAR WITH THE
IRAQ WAR?

00:04:02.642 --> 00:04:05.112
&gt;&gt; THE IRAQ WAR?

00:04:05.112 --> 00:04:05.912
THAT'S RIGHT.

00:04:05.912 --> 00:04:07.647
YOU GUYS WERE INVOLVED IN THAT,
TOO.

00:04:07.647 --> 00:04:08.682
&gt;&gt; YEAH, WE WERE THERE.

00:04:08.682 --> 00:04:12.419
&gt;&gt; YOU GUYS HAVE MADE SOME
[BLEEP] BONEHEAD MOVES.

00:04:12.419 --> 00:04:13.520
&gt;&gt; YEAH.

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:16.123
&gt;&gt; ALL RIGHT, LIKE US, THEY
FOUGHT AN UNNECESSARY WAR.

00:04:16.123 --> 00:04:19.993
THEIR GOVERNMENT APPROVAL
RATINGS ARE DISMAL.

00:04:19.993 --> 00:04:25.465
AND BRITISH LEADERS EVEN
PROMISED PUNISHING AUSTERITY

00:04:25.465 --> 00:04:28.001
MEASURES. SO APPARENTLY, NO
MATTER YOUR ELECTORAL SYSTEM,

00:04:28.001 --> 00:04:31.505
YOUR GOVERNMENT WILL FIND
A WAY TO [BLEEP] IT ALL UP.

00:04:31.505 --> 00:04:37.043
OR COURSE, IF YOU'RE BRITISH
THERE IS A CULTURAL

00:04:37.043 --> 00:04:38.044
ADVANTAGE THAT CANNOT BE DENIED.

00:04:38.044 --> 00:04:38.979
&gt;&gt; HEY, AND JORDAN WE ALSO USE
THE WORD [BLEEP].

00:04:38.979 --> 00:04:39.980
IT'S NOT A PROBLEM HERE, SO
CHEERS!

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:40.981
HERE'S TO THE POLITICS.

00:04:40.981 --> 00:04:42.983
&gt;&gt; WE DO.

00:04:42.983 --> 00:04:43.984
&gt;&gt; HEY [BLEEP]!

00:04:43.984 --> 00:04:46.186
&gt;&gt; [BLEEP].

00:04:46.186 --> 00:04:47.988
&gt;&gt; GOOD DAY, [BLEEP].

00:04:47.988 --> 00:04:49.990
&gt;&gt; HEY, [BLEEP]!

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:56.830
&gt;&gt; [BLEEP]!

00:04:56.830 --> 00:04:57.831
&gt;&gt; Jon:  JORDAN KLEPPER,
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

00:04:57.831 --> 00:04:58.465
