00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:03.310
In the last video, we
kind of reasoned our way

00:00:03.310 --> 00:00:08.234
towards finding the sum
of the factors of 27,000.

00:00:08.234 --> 00:00:10.150
What I want to do in
this video is really just

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:11.960
revisit what we did
in the last video,

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:15.670
and see if we can come up with a
more generalized way of finding

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:18.161
the sum of the
factors of a number.

00:00:18.161 --> 00:00:20.035
So in the last video,
we started with 27,000.

00:00:20.035 --> 00:00:22.500
And we figured out that
its prime factorization

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:27.160
is 3 to the third, times
2 to the third, times 5

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:27.730
to the third.

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:28.490
Or we could have
said 2 the third--

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:30.490
we could have switched
the orders here.

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:33.700
And we used that information
to say, well, OK, if this

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:37.920
is the prime factorization of
27,000, than any factor-- so,

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.790
let's say that this is
some factor of 27,000--

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:45.187
it has to be the product
of powers of 3, 2, and 5.

00:00:45.187 --> 00:00:46.270
So let me make that clear.

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:50.660
It has to be 3 to something
times 2 to something else--

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:55.040
they could be the same number--
times 5 to something else.

00:00:55.040 --> 00:01:01.200
And each of these x, y's, and
z's have to be between 0 and 3,

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:03.760
and they could be
equal to 0 or 3.

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:06.610
And actually, make it be clear--
they have to be integers.

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:10.280
They have to be integers,
where these are integers.

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:11.560
Integers.

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:14.410
This notation here implies that
you could be any number there,

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:17.430
but they have to be
integers in between 0 and 3,

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:19.050
including 0 and 3.

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:21.870
And just to be clear, we can
just generate arbitrary factors

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:22.030
here.

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:23.446
We could say, OK,
let's pick zero.

00:01:23.446 --> 00:01:28.970
It could be 3 to the 0, times
2 to the second power, times 5

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:29.590
to the 1.

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:32.500
This will be a factor of 27,000.

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:35.700
You could figure out this
is 1, times 4, times 5.

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:37.190
This is equal to 20.

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:38.700
And you can just
look-- you can just

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:40.579
keep taking different
values of x, y,

00:01:40.579 --> 00:01:41.870
and z to get all of the factor.

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:43.495
So essentially, you
have to through all

00:01:43.495 --> 00:01:45.792
of the different combinations
here and add them up.

00:01:45.792 --> 00:01:47.500
And that's what we
did in the last video.

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:49.041
And to be able to
think through that,

00:01:49.041 --> 00:01:51.060
I drew a little bit of a grid.

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:52.650
I started with powers of 3.

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:55.070
So 3 to the 0-- let
me write it here.

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:58.210
So you start with 3 to
the 0, 3 to the 1, 3

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:02.130
squared, 3 to the third is 27.

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:05.240
And then I had powers
of 2-- 2 to the 0,

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:10.080
2 to the first, 2
squared, 2 squared is 4.

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:12.320
And then 2 the third is 8.

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:15.770
And here, I was just
looking for the combinations

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:18.550
where we're looking at
the powers of 3 and 2

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:20.810
and we're multiplying
it times 5 to the 0.

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:23.250
So, we're not even
looking at having

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:27.592
a 5 as a factor yet of
all of these combinations.

00:02:27.592 --> 00:02:29.800
And what we did is we just
took each of these numbers

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:32.260
and we multiplied
them by each other.

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:36.070
So these would just be
a 1, a 3, a 9, and a 27.

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:39.940
I just took 1 times 1
is 1, 3 times 1 is 3.

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:42.180
And then you could go
down this row-- 1 times 2

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:45.190
is 2, 3 times 2 is 6.

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:46.510
9 times 2 is 18.

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:49.200
You could just keep
going-- 27 times 2 is 54.

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:52.000
And you could keep
figuring out all of these.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.050
But the shortcut that
we did in the last video

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:56.660
is we said, look, you don't
have to figure out all of those.

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:58.270
You could just
take this sum over

00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:00.140
here-- so whatever this is.

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:04.890
So 1 plus 3, plus 9, plus 27.

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:07.620
We figured out in the
last video it was 40.

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:09.280
This is the sum for
this first column.

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:12.300
The second sum is just going
to be 2 times this number.

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:13.490
So let me make it clear.

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:16.060
This is the same
thing as 1 times this.

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:21.770
The second column is going
to be 2 times this thing.

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:24.440
Because each of these terms
are just being multiplied by 2.

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:30.960
So it's 2 times 1, plus
3, plus 9, plus 27.

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:34.680
And then the third column
is going to be 4 times.

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:37.510
It's going to be 4 times
this business over here.

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:41.190
So 4 times-- let me
scroll over-- 4 times

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:45.020
1, plus 3, plus 9, plus 27.

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:47.890
And then the fourth
column will be 8 times,

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:51.480
and then they'll be plus
8 times all of that stuff.

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:54.530
1 plus 3, plus 9, plus 27.

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:56.720
In the last video, I
added them up and got 40,

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:59.210
but I'm keeping them
this way on purpose.

00:03:59.210 --> 00:04:02.100
Because this thing right here,
what I just wrote-- and this

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:07.360
is essentially the sums
of all of the combinations

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:11.310
where our x's and y's are
integers between 0 and 3,

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:12.700
including 0 and 3.

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:16.060
And z is 0, because we're not
multiplying any of these by 5.

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:18.695
So when we ignore
the 5, the sum here--

00:04:18.695 --> 00:04:20.820
and this is exactly what
we did in the last video--

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:26.040
this is exactly
equal to 1 plus 3,

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:35.630
plus 9, plus 27, times 1
plus 2, plus 4, plus 8.

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:39.280
If you just take
this term right here

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:44.620
and distribute it onto
each of these terms

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:46.640
you will get this
expression up here.

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:49.940
So to find all of the
combinations of the powers of 2

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:54.660
and 3 with not
multiplying things by 5,

00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:56.820
you, literally, just have
to take the powers of 3

00:04:56.820 --> 00:04:58.640
up to the third
power, because that's

00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:01.020
how many powers-- that's
how high we get when

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:05.050
we do the prime factorization
of 27,000-- and sum them up.

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:07.470
And then multiply that
times the power of 2

00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:08.747
up to the third power.

00:05:08.747 --> 00:05:11.080
And then, what we did in the
last video, we figured out.

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:13.320
OK, this value
right here-- this is

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:16.612
when we're only dealing
with 5 to the 0 power.

00:05:16.612 --> 00:05:18.070
If we want all of
the combinations,

00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:20.560
we would want this
grid multiplied by 5

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:22.944
to the 0, which is essentially
what this grid already is.

00:05:22.944 --> 00:05:24.360
And then we would
want to add that

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:27.080
to that grid multiplied
by 5 to the first.

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:32.360
And then, add that to this
grid multiplied by 5 squared.

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:34.050
And then add that
to this whole grid

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:36.220
multiplied by 5 to the third.

00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:39.240
And so this whole grid--
the sum of this whole grid--

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:40.390
is this right over here.

00:05:40.390 --> 00:05:41.910
Let's just call
this, I don't know.

00:05:41.910 --> 00:05:44.570
For simplicity, let's
just call this A.

00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:49.800
So if you really want the sum
of all of the factors of 27,000,

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:54.360
you would take A and multiply
it by 5 to the 0, which is 1.

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:57.720
And then add that
to A multiplied by 5

00:05:57.720 --> 00:06:01.540
squared-- or sorry, multiplied
by 5 to the first, which is 5.

00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:04.200
And then add that
to A multiplied

00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:08.590
by 5 squared, which is 25.

00:06:08.590 --> 00:06:11.510
And then add that
to A multiplied by 5

00:06:11.510 --> 00:06:13.417
to the third, which is 125.

00:06:13.417 --> 00:06:15.250
And of course, you can
factor out an A here.

00:06:15.250 --> 00:06:16.291
So this is our total sum.

00:06:16.291 --> 00:06:19.175
This would be the sum of
all the factors of 27,000.

00:06:19.175 --> 00:06:21.180
But you could factor
and A out here.

00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:28.530
And so our sum would be A times
1, plus 5, plus 25, plus 125.

00:06:28.530 --> 00:06:29.840
And we know what A is.

00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:31.210
A is this thing over here.

00:06:31.210 --> 00:06:34.140
So the sum of all of the
factors of 27,000-- actually,

00:06:34.140 --> 00:06:36.370
let me keep this over
here-- is equal to--

00:06:36.370 --> 00:06:40.160
and I'll color code it--
it's equal to-- this is A.

00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:44.790
So A is 1 plus 3,
plus 9, plus 27--

00:06:44.790 --> 00:06:46.300
it's not the right
shade of green,

00:06:46.300 --> 00:06:50.420
but hopefully, you get the
point-- times 1 plus 2,

00:06:50.420 --> 00:07:01.900
plus 4, plus 8, times 1
plus 5, plus 25, plus 125.

00:07:01.900 --> 00:07:04.320
So this, essentially,
is giving you

00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:08.060
a formula for finding the sum
of the factors of a number.

00:07:08.060 --> 00:07:10.572
You do the prime
factorization of the number.

00:07:10.572 --> 00:07:12.030
And I'm not doing
in general terms,

00:07:12.030 --> 00:07:13.520
I'm doing with a
particular case.

00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:14.936
And I'm doing that
because I think

00:07:14.936 --> 00:07:17.510
it makes it a little bit
clearer why this works.

00:07:17.510 --> 00:07:20.230
But our prime
factorization of 27,000

00:07:20.230 --> 00:07:22.890
is 3 to the third, times
2 to the third, times 5

00:07:22.890 --> 00:07:23.616
to the third.

00:07:23.616 --> 00:07:24.990
If we really want
to do the sum--

00:07:24.990 --> 00:07:26.650
and this is exactly what
we did in the last video,

00:07:26.650 --> 00:07:28.983
I'm just expressing it slightly
different here-- we just

00:07:28.983 --> 00:07:32.700
take all of the powers of 3 up
to 3 to the third, add them up.

00:07:32.700 --> 00:07:35.720
All the powers of 2 up to 2
to the third, add them up.

00:07:35.720 --> 00:07:39.080
All the powers of 5 up to 5
to the third, add them up.

00:07:39.080 --> 00:07:40.830
And then, take the product.

00:07:40.830 --> 00:07:42.140
And we can do that right now.

00:07:42.140 --> 00:07:47.810
So this is going to be-- so
this first term over here is 40,

00:07:47.810 --> 00:07:52.770
this term right here, 40
times-- this is 4 plus 8 is 12,

00:07:52.770 --> 00:07:55.070
plus 3 is 15.

00:07:55.070 --> 00:07:55.570
Right?

00:07:55.570 --> 00:07:56.070
3, yup.

00:07:56.070 --> 00:07:56.910
15.

00:07:56.910 --> 00:08:01.300
And then times--
25 plus 125 is 150.

00:08:01.300 --> 00:08:05.160
So this is 156.

00:08:05.160 --> 00:08:06.780
And if you take
the product-- here,

00:08:06.780 --> 00:08:09.770
actually, let's just do
it just to prove the point

00:08:09.770 --> 00:08:11.600
that this actually does work.

00:08:11.600 --> 00:08:15.960
So 40 times 15--
4 times 15 is 60--

00:08:15.960 --> 00:08:18.230
so this is going to be 600.

00:08:18.230 --> 00:08:20.790
So this part right here is
going to be equal to 600.

00:08:20.790 --> 00:08:24.094
So it's going to boil
down to 600 times 156.

00:08:24.094 --> 00:08:25.010
So let's just do that.

00:08:25.010 --> 00:08:28.160
156-- let's just
multiply it by 6,

00:08:28.160 --> 00:08:30.380
and then I'll add two
0's to it at the end.

00:08:30.380 --> 00:08:33.030
So 6 times 6 is 36.

00:08:33.030 --> 00:08:37.270
6 times 5 is 30, plus 3 is 33.

00:08:37.270 --> 00:08:39.780
6 times 1 is 6, plus 3 is 9.

00:08:39.780 --> 00:08:42.070
And of course, if we want
to multiply it by 600,

00:08:42.070 --> 00:08:45.250
we just add two 0's here, and
we get the exact same answer

00:08:45.250 --> 00:08:47.781
that we got in the last video.

00:08:47.781 --> 00:08:49.280
So hopefully, you
found that useful.

00:08:49.280 --> 00:08:50.940
I haven't proven it
in general terms,

00:08:50.940 --> 00:08:52.314
but you can--
maybe I'll do that,

00:08:52.314 --> 00:08:54.240
if I feel like doing
a video on that.

00:08:54.240 --> 00:08:57.660
But you see a general
method for finding

00:08:57.660 --> 00:08:59.220
the sum of the
factors of a number.

00:08:59.220 --> 00:09:01.030
Actually, let me
just write that.

00:09:01.030 --> 00:09:03.589
Let's just do another
problem just real fast.

00:09:03.589 --> 00:09:05.380
Let's say I had the
number-- I don't know--

00:09:05.380 --> 00:09:11.610
let's say we had to find the
sum of the factors of 300.

00:09:11.610 --> 00:09:18.400
So 300 is 3 times 100,
which is 10 times 10.

00:09:18.400 --> 00:09:22.780
And that is 2 times
5, times 2, times 5.

00:09:22.780 --> 00:09:30.390
So 300 is equal to 3 times
2 squared, times 5 squared.

00:09:30.390 --> 00:09:32.750
That's the prime
factorization of 300.

00:09:32.750 --> 00:09:35.570
So if we wanted to find the
sum of all of its factors,

00:09:35.570 --> 00:09:40.290
it would be 3 to
the 0, which is 1,

00:09:40.290 --> 00:09:42.630
plus 3 to the 1, which is three.

00:09:42.630 --> 00:09:44.430
We won't go to any
higher powers of 3

00:09:44.430 --> 00:09:46.013
here, because that's
the highest power

00:09:46.013 --> 00:09:47.590
we have in the
prime factorization.

00:09:47.590 --> 00:09:49.850
So that's dealing with the 3's.

00:09:49.850 --> 00:09:54.610
Times 2 to the 0,
which is 1, plus 2

00:09:54.610 --> 00:09:57.980
to the 1, which is 2,
plus 2 squared-- that's

00:09:57.980 --> 00:10:00.170
how high we can get, which is 4.

00:10:00.170 --> 00:10:06.140
And then, times-- you just
do the 5-- times 5 to the 0,

00:10:06.140 --> 00:10:08.410
which is 1, plus 5 to
the first power, which

00:10:08.410 --> 00:10:10.504
is 5, plus 5
squared, which is 25.

00:10:10.504 --> 00:10:12.420
Can't go any higher than
that, because we only

00:10:12.420 --> 00:10:15.510
go up to two 5's up here
at 5 to the second power.

00:10:15.510 --> 00:10:26.740
And so this is going to
be 4 times 7, times 31.

00:10:26.740 --> 00:10:28.710
So this is going
to be 28 times 31.

00:10:32.050 --> 00:10:34.180
1 times 28 is 28.

00:10:34.180 --> 00:10:34.930
Put a 0 down here.

00:10:34.930 --> 00:10:38.370
3 times 8 is 24.

00:10:38.370 --> 00:10:46.400
3 times 2 is 6, plus 2 is 8,
and then you get 8, 6, and 8.

00:10:46.400 --> 00:10:51.030
So the sum of all the
factors of 300 is 868.

00:10:51.030 --> 00:10:53.610
Hopefully, you found
that interesting.
