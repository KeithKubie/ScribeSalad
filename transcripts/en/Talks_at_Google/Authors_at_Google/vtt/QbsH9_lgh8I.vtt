MATTHEW REINHART:
Hey, everybody.

00:00:06.610 --> 00:00:07.185
Hi.

00:00:07.185 --> 00:00:08.060
Thanks for having me.

00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:10.010
Did you guys have a good lunch?

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:10.760
Yeah, me too.

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:12.301
I'm telling you, I
want to work here.

00:00:12.301 --> 00:00:14.886
Because that lunch was awesome.

00:00:14.886 --> 00:00:16.219
I don't make anything near that.

00:00:16.219 --> 00:00:17.760
Anyways, my name is
Matthew Reinhart.

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:19.790
And I make pop-up books.

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:21.350
Some people call me
a paper engineer.

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:24.650
Some people call me a
children's book Illustrator.

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:27.750
I like to think of myself as
all those things and many more.

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:31.610
And today, I'm going to show
you a little bit about how

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:32.540
I do what I do.

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:35.570
I'm also going to make a
pop-up book here and show

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:39.870
you some things that you can
actually make at home, too.

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:42.200
So let's get started.

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:45.410
Say hello-- see, I always
have to put notes for myself

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:46.970
in these presentations.

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:49.070
It helps me a lot
when I'm doing it

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:50.390
to say hello and get started.

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:51.380
So we got that done.

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:52.970
All right, very good.

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:55.370
All right, so when
I was young, I

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:58.190
had no idea that
there was such a thing

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:01.652
as a paper engineer or a
pop-up book maker or whatever.

00:01:01.652 --> 00:01:02.360
I was just a kid.

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:04.190
I liked to ride bikes.

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:07.080
My fashion sense
was a little off.

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:08.540
But I didn't know.

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:10.160
And you guys are really lucky.

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:13.040
Everyone's really lucky to
be able to come here and be

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:16.070
with your parents and
see what they do at work.

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:17.510
It's really important.

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:20.900
As you get older, you get to
learn about what things work

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:23.410
and what things work for
you and what things you

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:25.160
might like to do as a
job and other things

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:26.450
you may not like to do.

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:30.350
So growing up, my parents
did different things.

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:32.600
And I would go to work with.

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:34.700
Here is-- my mother was
an aerobic instructor.

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:38.630
There I am in the background,
if you can see, really.

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:42.430
And yes, it was the '80s.

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:44.450
It's not my fault.

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:46.280
My dad was a dentist.

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:49.890
Here I am at the
dentist, helping my dad.

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:52.990
He only let me use that
drill once, though.

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:53.490
Yeah.

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:56.740
But anyways, I look
good in scrubs.

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:00.250
But seriously though, tell
a little about myself--

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:03.940
so enough of the jokes.

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:06.400
So I have always sort of--

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:08.710
growing up, my dad
was in the Navy.

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:10.479
We lived all over the place.

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:13.630
The one thing that I always
took with me was artwork.

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:14.440
So I always drew.

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:15.377
I always made stuff.

00:02:15.377 --> 00:02:17.710
There I am in that corner
there when I was really young,

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:19.630
writing my first book.

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:20.350
It was a novel.

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:23.320
It took me forever.

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:25.956
But I was always making things.

00:02:25.956 --> 00:02:26.830
I was always drawing.

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:31.960
And I was creating
things with my hands.

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:34.330
Because that was what
could come with me.

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:40.380
If I didn't have friends in a
new space or if we had moved,

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:42.270
my artwork always came with me.

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:44.490
So I spent a lot of time
by myself making things.

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:47.760
And when I was young, there
were no Michaels stores.

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:52.260
So getting supplies to make the
stuff wasn't always as easy.

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:55.770
So I was always rummaging
through the garbage or anything

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:59.520
extra-- making things out
of boxes, cereal boxes.

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:03.750
Styrofoam from any sort of
electronic that we ever got,

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:06.780
I was always buying
or grabbing the boxes

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:07.980
and making stuff out of it.

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:10.410
If there was a toy
that didn't exist,

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:13.080
I would make it myself
out of whatever I could.

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:16.110
Right there, you see a picture
of me with my little sister.

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:19.830
I think I made a little
cardboard puppetry stage.

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:22.260
And as usual, my
sister would destroy it

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:23.654
within a few seconds.

00:03:23.654 --> 00:03:25.320
She would come over,
oh, this is great--

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:26.550
rip.

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:31.150
So that was kind of
what it was like.

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:33.970
This is a drawing I did, I
think back in first grade.

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:37.390
And I have always had an
interest in biology and zoology

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:38.980
and paleontology.

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:40.420
I love dinosaurs.

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:43.280
I love-- but I really
just loved making

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:46.480
artwork and kind of telling
stories with pictures.

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:49.030
As you can see also, I was a
little bit of an egomaniac.

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:51.920
My name is really
big up in the corner.

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:55.450
And I think that's kind of
translated into myself now.

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:58.120
But so it was--

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:01.510
but being an artist really
wasn't a viable option,

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:04.390
at least when I was
younger, for a career.

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:06.910
At the time, we didn't
have the Google.

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:09.220
And we couldn't go
online and figure out--

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:11.380
do our research so easily.

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:14.290
We had to go to those things
called libraries and things.

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:15.020
And we would go.

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:18.700
And I didn't know as much about
all the creative jobs that

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:20.200
are out there, all
the ways that you

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:25.630
can channel that creative
energy and that talent.

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:29.650
And so when I went
off from high school,

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:32.860
I didn't have a
lot of motivation

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:34.990
to find out what I could do.

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:37.240
My parents didn't want me
to be a starving artist.

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:38.780
They used that a
lot, all the time.

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:42.130
We don't want you to
be a starving artist.

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:46.330
And so I went to school
for my college years.

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:49.210
And I studied biology.

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:52.880
Actually, my undergraduate
degree in biological sciences.

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:55.300
And I was going to be a doctor.

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:58.000
I studied pre-med.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:01.589
I went to Clemson University
for my undergraduate degree.

00:05:01.589 --> 00:05:02.380
And you can see me.

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:04.990
I think I'm up in the
corner there somewhere.

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:06.199
Anyway, so I went to Clemson.

00:05:06.199 --> 00:05:07.698
The entire time I
was there, though,

00:05:07.698 --> 00:05:09.370
while I was studying
all these biology

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:11.890
and chemistry and
biochemistry, which

00:05:11.890 --> 00:05:15.480
is horrible, if you've ever--
biochemistry is the worst.

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:18.150
After-- when I was studying
all these different things,

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:19.600
I felt something like--

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:21.890
I felt like it
wasn't quite right.

00:05:21.890 --> 00:05:23.410
I mean, I was interested in it.

00:05:23.410 --> 00:05:24.576
And I was pretty good at it.

00:05:24.576 --> 00:05:26.380
And actually, I got
into medical school.

00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:29.620
But I just-- it wasn't right.

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:32.920
So the whole time I was
doing all this science,

00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:34.514
I was also doing
artwork on the side.

00:05:34.514 --> 00:05:35.680
I was always doing sketches.

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:39.490
I was always making these giant
paintings of weird things.

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:44.050
And I wanted to see if there
was a way I could apply that

00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:46.840
and some of my
science skill to a job

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:49.190
that I just didn't
know at the time.

00:05:49.190 --> 00:05:51.880
So before I went to med
school-- like I said, I got in--

00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:55.307
before I went to school to be
a doctor, which is a long haul.

00:05:55.307 --> 00:05:56.640
There's a lot that goes into it.

00:05:56.640 --> 00:05:58.869
My parents were
really pushing for it.

00:05:58.869 --> 00:06:00.160
I told them, listen, I need a--

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:01.870
I want a year off
before I go to school.

00:06:01.870 --> 00:06:03.910
And I want to live
in New York City.

00:06:03.910 --> 00:06:07.690
And oh-- that one
went before this one.

00:06:07.690 --> 00:06:08.750
Let's see.

00:06:08.750 --> 00:06:09.940
So I lived in New York City.

00:06:09.940 --> 00:06:13.240
That's the apartment that
we lived in down in--

00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:14.560
on Canal Street, actually.

00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:16.600
We had rats like this big.

00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:18.017
I swear to God.

00:06:18.017 --> 00:06:19.850
It was a really cool
space that we lived in.

00:06:19.850 --> 00:06:22.660
But actually, we lived
over a stereo store.

00:06:22.660 --> 00:06:26.640
So from noon till
about 7:00 at night,

00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:30.400
the vibrations from
the stereos downstairs

00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:34.030
would move our furniture so
that everything would shake.

00:06:34.030 --> 00:06:36.430
And during that time when
I lived in New York City,

00:06:36.430 --> 00:06:38.590
I worked for an
organization that

00:06:38.590 --> 00:06:40.600
helped find corneas
for people who

00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:42.040
had trouble with their eyes.

00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:43.700
And I worked with
a lot of hospitals.

00:06:43.700 --> 00:06:46.510
So I was getting an
idea of what it was

00:06:46.510 --> 00:06:48.350
like to work with sick people.

00:06:48.350 --> 00:06:51.250
And I realized I didn't like
working with sick people.

00:06:51.250 --> 00:06:54.294
I didn't know if it was a good
idea for me to work as a doctor

00:06:54.294 --> 00:06:55.460
if I didn't like doing that.

00:06:55.460 --> 00:06:56.850
It was really hard.

00:06:56.850 --> 00:06:58.130
And it was really scary.

00:06:58.130 --> 00:07:01.570
And so while I was here, I
came to that realization.

00:07:01.570 --> 00:07:02.410
And I also--

00:07:02.410 --> 00:07:05.422
New York is a really
exciting, creative place.

00:07:05.422 --> 00:07:06.880
I mean, there's
all kinds of people

00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:09.370
doing all kinds of
weird jobs, things

00:07:09.370 --> 00:07:11.140
that you would
never know existed.

00:07:11.140 --> 00:07:13.970
And while I was in New York
at that time-- and this

00:07:13.970 --> 00:07:20.710
was about 25 years ago, back
when the Times Square was not

00:07:20.710 --> 00:07:23.295
filled with lots of
Disneyland-like lights

00:07:23.295 --> 00:07:23.920
and everything.

00:07:23.920 --> 00:07:24.878
It was a lot different.

00:07:24.878 --> 00:07:27.840
I'm not going to go into that.

00:07:27.840 --> 00:07:29.912
But I also was meeting
a lot of people

00:07:29.912 --> 00:07:31.870
who were doing a lot of
different kinds of jobs

00:07:31.870 --> 00:07:33.930
and a lot of different
kind of creative jobs.

00:07:33.930 --> 00:07:36.842
And so I ended up going to my
parents and saying, listen,

00:07:36.842 --> 00:07:38.300
this is not something
I want to do.

00:07:38.300 --> 00:07:40.640
I don't want to be a doctor.

00:07:40.640 --> 00:07:42.740
I really want to do
something creative.

00:07:42.740 --> 00:07:46.160
And shockingly,
they told me, OK.

00:07:46.160 --> 00:07:47.051
You can do that.

00:07:47.051 --> 00:07:49.550
But you have to find something
where you'll be able to live.

00:07:49.550 --> 00:07:51.750
Because we ain't
paying for you forever.

00:07:51.750 --> 00:07:53.120
And so I did my research.

00:07:53.120 --> 00:07:56.820
And I discovered that
there is something

00:07:56.820 --> 00:07:58.230
called industrial design.

00:07:58.230 --> 00:08:00.240
And that is the
design of products,

00:08:00.240 --> 00:08:04.320
all kinds of products, whether
they be tables or scissors

00:08:04.320 --> 00:08:08.407
or cool Nike shoes or
even toys that you get,

00:08:08.407 --> 00:08:09.240
like action figures.

00:08:09.240 --> 00:08:11.760
I'm a big action figure
collector, actually.

00:08:11.760 --> 00:08:14.250
I have a huge Star
Wars figure collection,

00:08:14.250 --> 00:08:17.010
like 2,000 different
Star Wars figures.

00:08:17.010 --> 00:08:19.020
And I've been
collecting since '78.

00:08:19.020 --> 00:08:20.100
So I have a lot.

00:08:20.100 --> 00:08:21.579
And I also collect Transformers.

00:08:21.579 --> 00:08:23.370
And you'll see a little
bit of that trickle

00:08:23.370 --> 00:08:25.130
into the work I do.

00:08:25.130 --> 00:08:26.857
I have a huge
Transformer collection.

00:08:26.857 --> 00:08:29.190
Now here in New York City,
we don't have a lot of space.

00:08:29.190 --> 00:08:31.470
So I can't have like
a Transformers room

00:08:31.470 --> 00:08:32.559
in my apartment.

00:08:32.559 --> 00:08:34.049
I have a Transformer closet.

00:08:34.049 --> 00:08:36.539
But thank goodness
for off-site storage,

00:08:36.539 --> 00:08:38.870
because that's where the
rest of my collection goes.

00:08:38.870 --> 00:08:42.299
Anyways, I studied industrial
design at-- let's see if that

00:08:42.299 --> 00:08:43.470
picture comes up--

00:08:43.470 --> 00:08:46.480
Pratt Institute,
which is in Brooklyn.

00:08:46.480 --> 00:08:47.850
And I took a grad--

00:08:47.850 --> 00:08:50.414
I did the graduate program at
Pratt Institute, studied there

00:08:50.414 --> 00:08:51.330
for a couple of years.

00:08:51.330 --> 00:08:55.270
And while I was there, I--

00:08:55.270 --> 00:08:57.870
let's see if that
other picture comes up.

00:08:57.870 --> 00:08:58.370
There it is.

00:08:58.370 --> 00:08:59.010
It's New York.

00:08:59.010 --> 00:09:02.830
Well, I already told
you I was in New York.

00:09:02.830 --> 00:09:05.880
While I was there, I worked
with a gentleman who--

00:09:05.880 --> 00:09:08.410
he needed some help
making pop-ups.

00:09:08.410 --> 00:09:09.640
And I was his intern.

00:09:09.640 --> 00:09:12.187
And I just needed like an
extra job to make some money.

00:09:12.187 --> 00:09:13.020
You know, it was OK.

00:09:13.020 --> 00:09:14.855
I could cut up and
fold paper, whatever.

00:09:14.855 --> 00:09:15.730
It wasn't a big deal.

00:09:15.730 --> 00:09:17.500
I didn't really even
think about pop-ups.

00:09:17.500 --> 00:09:21.400
In fact, growing up, I
only had one pop-up book.

00:09:21.400 --> 00:09:23.290
And this was it.

00:09:23.290 --> 00:09:25.450
This-- it's
dinosaurs, obviously.

00:09:25.450 --> 00:09:27.160
And it was beautiful
illustration.

00:09:27.160 --> 00:09:30.130
And when you opened it
up, there was a pop-up.

00:09:30.130 --> 00:09:32.680
And it's a little different
than from some of the ones

00:09:32.680 --> 00:09:33.400
that I do.

00:09:33.400 --> 00:09:36.730
I do kind of a little bit
more elaborate ones like this.

00:09:36.730 --> 00:09:40.690
But we'll-- get in there.

00:09:40.690 --> 00:09:41.950
But I really loved it.

00:09:41.950 --> 00:09:44.650
Now, this pop-up
ended up-- after it

00:09:44.650 --> 00:09:48.650
was in my household for a little
while, probably about an hour

00:09:48.650 --> 00:09:57.670
or so, it looked like
this because of one person

00:09:57.670 --> 00:09:59.470
in the house.

00:09:59.470 --> 00:10:01.240
So I really didn't
think about pop-ups.

00:10:01.240 --> 00:10:05.082
It was never in my mind
or anything like that.

00:10:05.082 --> 00:10:08.560
[LAUGHTER]

00:10:08.560 --> 00:10:10.701
That's really-- yeah, yeah.

00:10:10.701 --> 00:10:11.950
So pop-ups weren't in my mind.

00:10:11.950 --> 00:10:13.930
But I would help--

00:10:13.930 --> 00:10:16.240
when I was younger and
when I was in grad school,

00:10:16.240 --> 00:10:18.790
I was helping this
paper engineer.

00:10:18.790 --> 00:10:23.470
And I would cut and fold paper
and follow his instructions.

00:10:23.470 --> 00:10:25.000
And it was a long time.

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:28.630
I worked for him a couple
of years, just doing this.

00:10:28.630 --> 00:10:32.560
And when I got out of school,
I realized that maybe this

00:10:32.560 --> 00:10:34.480
is something I can do.

00:10:34.480 --> 00:10:35.500
And so there was a lot--

00:10:35.500 --> 00:10:37.660
so for quite a few
years, I apprenticed.

00:10:37.660 --> 00:10:39.760
And what that really
means is I worked.

00:10:39.760 --> 00:10:41.860
And I would help
him with his work.

00:10:41.860 --> 00:10:43.840
And it wasn't always the
stuff I wanted to do.

00:10:43.840 --> 00:10:45.610
In fact, the designs,
I didn't always

00:10:45.610 --> 00:10:52.880
like, even though he did really
beautiful work like this.

00:10:52.880 --> 00:10:55.584
I worked with Robert
Sabuda for many years.

00:10:55.584 --> 00:10:58.250
And he does a lot of very white,
beautiful, structural, pop-ups,

00:10:58.250 --> 00:10:58.880
and stuff.

00:10:58.880 --> 00:11:03.560
We worked on things for the
MOMA and other publishers.

00:11:03.560 --> 00:11:07.670
I learned a lot from just
learning how structurally,

00:11:07.670 --> 00:11:08.540
how this stuff--

00:11:08.540 --> 00:11:12.114
but it wasn't always the stuff
that I wanted to do myself.

00:11:12.114 --> 00:11:13.280
But that's really important.

00:11:13.280 --> 00:11:15.290
In the beginning when
you're learning something,

00:11:15.290 --> 00:11:17.870
sometimes you've
got to do the work.

00:11:17.870 --> 00:11:20.130
And it isn't always exactly
what you want to do.

00:11:20.130 --> 00:11:21.980
But it helps you learn.

00:11:21.980 --> 00:11:24.920
So after years of learning
all these different principles

00:11:24.920 --> 00:11:27.300
and learning all this
stuff how to make pop-ups,

00:11:27.300 --> 00:11:31.260
I got to start
doing my own books.

00:11:31.260 --> 00:11:33.882
Some of the-- the first books
I did weren't like these--

00:11:33.882 --> 00:11:35.340
they were these
really weird books,

00:11:35.340 --> 00:11:37.210
"The Pop-Up Book of
Phobias" and "The Pop-Up

00:11:37.210 --> 00:11:38.080
Book of Nightmares."

00:11:38.080 --> 00:11:39.330
They were these bizarre books.

00:11:39.330 --> 00:11:41.830
I never even thought
they'd actually come out.

00:11:41.830 --> 00:11:44.940
But actually, the phobia book
was really popular, especially

00:11:44.940 --> 00:11:47.220
with therapists in the city.

00:11:50.200 --> 00:11:52.460
Then I was able to start
making books that I really,

00:11:52.460 --> 00:11:53.960
really was excited about.

00:11:53.960 --> 00:11:57.530
I had-- my first "New
York Times" bestseller

00:11:57.530 --> 00:11:59.480
was a pop-up book
of butterflies.

00:11:59.480 --> 00:12:01.940
And after that, we were
able to create a series

00:12:01.940 --> 00:12:03.560
about prehistoric animals.

00:12:03.560 --> 00:12:05.360
Because I love paleontology.

00:12:05.360 --> 00:12:06.890
First was this
dinosaur book called

00:12:06.890 --> 00:12:08.780
"Encyclopedia Prehistorica."

00:12:08.780 --> 00:12:12.830
And this has been translated now
to about 25 different languages

00:12:12.830 --> 00:12:14.000
around the world.

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:17.660
And doing this project, it says
I collaborate-- on these books,

00:12:17.660 --> 00:12:19.280
I collaborated
with Robert Sabuda.

00:12:19.280 --> 00:12:20.960
He would just sort
of oversee things.

00:12:20.960 --> 00:12:25.850
But I would do the writing, the
artwork, and the engineering,

00:12:25.850 --> 00:12:28.310
so all parts of
making a pop-up book.

00:12:28.310 --> 00:12:30.980
We made three in this series.

00:12:30.980 --> 00:12:31.924
And when you make--

00:12:31.924 --> 00:12:33.590
when you're just
starting out and you're

00:12:33.590 --> 00:12:36.050
making these big books,
you will learn a lot.

00:12:36.050 --> 00:12:37.130
Boy, you learn a lot.

00:12:37.130 --> 00:12:38.990
But you make a lot of mistakes.

00:12:38.990 --> 00:12:43.070
And each book, I look at it
and I see a lot of mistakes.

00:12:43.070 --> 00:12:44.784
In fact, I can't
always enjoy my books

00:12:44.784 --> 00:12:46.700
when they're finished,
because all I do is go,

00:12:46.700 --> 00:12:47.810
oh, you could have
done that better.

00:12:47.810 --> 00:12:48.893
Oh, that wasn't that good.

00:12:48.893 --> 00:12:50.670
But a lot of other
people don't know that.

00:12:50.670 --> 00:12:55.980
So I-- yes, I go to a therapist
about this sort of stuff.

00:12:55.980 --> 00:12:57.050
So I did this series.

00:12:57.050 --> 00:13:00.080
And then let's see
what else we got.

00:13:00.080 --> 00:13:03.770
I've done a lot of books about
classic stories and fairytales

00:13:03.770 --> 00:13:05.220
like "Cinderella"
and "The Jungle

00:13:05.220 --> 00:13:06.511
Book," which is really awesome.

00:13:06.511 --> 00:13:08.660
I love that one.

00:13:08.660 --> 00:13:10.580
I did a series about mythology.

00:13:10.580 --> 00:13:14.600
So I love learning about things
like mythology and history

00:13:14.600 --> 00:13:15.260
and science.

00:13:15.260 --> 00:13:18.530
And I like-- I kind of have
one of those minds where

00:13:18.530 --> 00:13:21.530
I'm obsessive-- surprise.

00:13:21.530 --> 00:13:23.470
I get obsessive about a subject.

00:13:23.470 --> 00:13:25.130
So when I want to
learn something,

00:13:25.130 --> 00:13:27.020
I just don't want
to learn a little.

00:13:27.020 --> 00:13:28.490
I got to learn a lot.

00:13:28.490 --> 00:13:30.020
And what happens,
though, when you

00:13:30.020 --> 00:13:32.395
do that, especially when you're
creating books like this,

00:13:32.395 --> 00:13:36.290
you have only so much space
in this biological computer

00:13:36.290 --> 00:13:37.230
in your head.

00:13:37.230 --> 00:13:39.470
And so when I learn
something else,

00:13:39.470 --> 00:13:41.540
it kind of pushes
the old stuff out.

00:13:41.540 --> 00:13:42.860
And the new stuff goes in.

00:13:42.860 --> 00:13:44.180
So I learn stuff.

00:13:44.180 --> 00:13:46.080
And then it pushes old stuff.

00:13:46.080 --> 00:13:48.230
So thank God I still know
how to walk and talk.

00:13:48.230 --> 00:13:50.600
Because I've learned so much
about all these different

00:13:50.600 --> 00:13:51.570
subjects.

00:13:51.570 --> 00:13:53.240
So this is mythology,
this series.

00:13:53.240 --> 00:13:56.170
The "Gods and Heroes" book
is actually pretty cool.

00:13:56.170 --> 00:13:57.360
It was a lot of fun to do.

00:13:57.360 --> 00:13:57.860
I did

00:13:57.860 --> 00:13:59.750
A book with Maurice
Sendak at one point.

00:13:59.750 --> 00:14:02.070
Maurice Sendak did "Where
the Wild Things Are."

00:14:02.070 --> 00:14:04.100
This pop a book
was called "Mommy?"

00:14:04.100 --> 00:14:06.860
And it was about-- it
barely had any words in it.

00:14:06.860 --> 00:14:09.980
But it was about a baby who
went into a mad scientist's lab.

00:14:09.980 --> 00:14:12.350
And of course, in
Maurice's world,

00:14:12.350 --> 00:14:15.980
the baby defeats all the
monsters in funny ways

00:14:15.980 --> 00:14:19.100
like pulling down their pants
and doing fun stuff like that,

00:14:19.100 --> 00:14:19.880
which of course--

00:14:19.880 --> 00:14:23.050
I mean, it makes total sense.

00:14:23.050 --> 00:14:25.140
I also, like I said,
really love Star Wars.

00:14:25.140 --> 00:14:28.020
Now, I'm an old-school
Star Wars fan.

00:14:28.020 --> 00:14:32.190
And so I did the first book
for the 30th anniversary

00:14:32.190 --> 00:14:34.200
of the original
Star Wars trilogy.

00:14:34.200 --> 00:14:35.184
And that's awesome.

00:14:35.184 --> 00:14:36.600
This year is the
40th anniversary.

00:14:36.600 --> 00:14:38.500
So that book is 10 years old.

00:14:38.500 --> 00:14:40.010
It was incredible.

00:14:40.010 --> 00:14:42.250
It was a huge dream come true.

00:14:42.250 --> 00:14:43.020
It was a dream.

00:14:43.020 --> 00:14:44.130
And it was a nightmare.

00:14:44.130 --> 00:14:46.890
Making it, I'm so
obsessive that I had

00:14:46.890 --> 00:14:48.570
to get everything just right.

00:14:48.570 --> 00:14:52.650
That-- I actually put myself
in that book as a character.

00:14:52.650 --> 00:14:54.499
So it was fun to be
able to do that and put

00:14:54.499 --> 00:14:55.290
some of my friends.

00:14:55.290 --> 00:14:58.200
In fact, a lot of
times in my books,

00:14:58.200 --> 00:15:02.075
I do put family and friends,
even pets that I used to have.

00:15:02.075 --> 00:15:03.450
In fact, in my
"Cinderella" book,

00:15:03.450 --> 00:15:05.510
my pet rabbits from
when I was a kid

00:15:05.510 --> 00:15:07.890
are following Cinderella
throughout the book.

00:15:07.890 --> 00:15:11.720
Because everyone wants to
learn about Lucy, Bernadine,

00:15:11.720 --> 00:15:15.522
and Fuzzball, my pet rabbits
from when I was young.

00:15:15.522 --> 00:15:16.980
I also did a second
Star Wars book.

00:15:16.980 --> 00:15:18.660
And I'll probably do
a third Star Wars book

00:15:18.660 --> 00:15:20.368
once we're finished
with the new trilogy.

00:15:20.368 --> 00:15:22.740
And I can't wait.

00:15:22.740 --> 00:15:26.790
I love comic books, and
especially DC Comics.

00:15:26.790 --> 00:15:29.142
I did two superhero
books so far.

00:15:29.142 --> 00:15:30.600
But there may be
another big Marvel

00:15:30.600 --> 00:15:31.740
one coming in the future.

00:15:31.740 --> 00:15:34.350
I actually got to work with
six different comic book

00:15:34.350 --> 00:15:35.700
artists for this book.

00:15:35.700 --> 00:15:38.040
It was awesome to be
able to create it.

00:15:38.040 --> 00:15:39.680
And it actually as a light-up--

00:15:39.680 --> 00:15:41.940
some of my books have
light-up parts in them.

00:15:41.940 --> 00:15:45.190
What they call my type of
work, paper engineering,

00:15:45.190 --> 00:15:46.780
they call it
low-tech engineering.

00:15:46.780 --> 00:15:50.760
Because I'm only working with
one type of material, paper.

00:15:50.760 --> 00:15:52.860
But sometimes I use other
things like electronics.

00:15:52.860 --> 00:15:55.260
So in this book and
in the Star Wars book,

00:15:55.260 --> 00:15:56.340
there are electronics.

00:15:56.340 --> 00:15:58.590
As a matter of fact, at the
end of the Star Wars book,

00:15:58.590 --> 00:15:59.700
there's Darth Vader.

00:15:59.700 --> 00:16:03.480
Now-- and at the top, there
are two working lights.

00:16:03.480 --> 00:16:05.940
And now you can't tell
with the lights in here,

00:16:05.940 --> 00:16:08.430
but that lightsaber
that Luke has lights up.

00:16:08.430 --> 00:16:10.976
And then on the opposite side,
the Darth Vader one does.

00:16:10.976 --> 00:16:13.350
So there's actually wires that
go in underneath the page.

00:16:13.350 --> 00:16:14.490
I wish the lights
weren't so bright.

00:16:14.490 --> 00:16:16.280
But you would be able
to see that better.

00:16:16.280 --> 00:16:19.530
But anyway, it's been cool
to be able to create things

00:16:19.530 --> 00:16:20.484
like that.

00:16:20.484 --> 00:16:22.650
And in this one, it has a
bat signal that lights up.

00:16:22.650 --> 00:16:25.230
It's super cool.

00:16:25.230 --> 00:16:26.370
Yes, I'm a brony.

00:16:26.370 --> 00:16:28.290
I totally made a Pony book.

00:16:28.290 --> 00:16:29.910
It was awesome.

00:16:29.910 --> 00:16:32.187
And I can't wait
for the big movie.

00:16:32.187 --> 00:16:34.770
What's cool about working with
My Little Pony is in this book,

00:16:34.770 --> 00:16:37.740
I actually got to
make myself a pony.

00:16:37.740 --> 00:16:40.470
My pony name is
Professor Paper Scraps.

00:16:40.470 --> 00:16:43.904
And I dare you to
find me in this book.

00:16:43.904 --> 00:16:45.570
I'm somewhere in one
of the backgrounds.

00:16:45.570 --> 00:16:46.690
So it was really cool.

00:16:46.690 --> 00:16:50.430
I love the-- my sister loved My
Little Pony when we were young.

00:16:50.430 --> 00:16:52.950
But the new pony
show is awesome.

00:16:52.950 --> 00:16:55.680
And I was forced to
watch all of them.

00:16:55.680 --> 00:16:56.519
And it was great.

00:16:56.519 --> 00:16:57.060
It was great.

00:16:57.060 --> 00:16:57.590
I love it.

00:16:57.590 --> 00:17:00.010
It was-- it's really fun.

00:17:00.010 --> 00:17:01.800
I did-- sometimes
I try to do books

00:17:01.800 --> 00:17:03.051
where they aren't just a book.

00:17:03.051 --> 00:17:04.008
They're something else.

00:17:04.008 --> 00:17:05.790
This book was for the
"Game of Thrones."

00:17:05.790 --> 00:17:08.760
And it not only becomes--

00:17:08.760 --> 00:17:11.550
it's not only a pop-up book
about all the different places

00:17:11.550 --> 00:17:13.839
in the "Game of Thrones"
in Westeros and everything,

00:17:13.839 --> 00:17:15.480
it also becomes a giant map.

00:17:15.480 --> 00:17:16.859
It's about as big as a table.

00:17:16.859 --> 00:17:19.079
So you can enjoy it both ways.

00:17:19.079 --> 00:17:21.569
Some people say it's important
to think outside the box.

00:17:21.569 --> 00:17:24.810
I like to say it's important
to think outside the book.

00:17:24.810 --> 00:17:27.300
And so there are a
lot more projects

00:17:27.300 --> 00:17:29.460
that are coming up
that we're trying

00:17:29.460 --> 00:17:31.770
to stretch the boundaries
of what a pop-up book can

00:17:31.770 --> 00:17:35.888
be or just what a book can be
and how it can be interactive.

00:17:39.800 --> 00:17:42.850
I also like to express
my feminine side.

00:17:42.850 --> 00:17:46.730
And I am big into princesses.

00:17:46.730 --> 00:17:48.950
So-- and I'm cool with that.

00:17:48.950 --> 00:17:50.450
I'm cool with that, all right?

00:17:50.450 --> 00:17:53.400
So I've done two
Disney princess books.

00:17:53.400 --> 00:17:54.790
One was, of course, "Frozen."

00:17:54.790 --> 00:17:55.790
Because let me tell you.

00:17:55.790 --> 00:17:57.623
When Disney calls you
up and they say, would

00:17:57.623 --> 00:17:59.074
you like to do a Fro--

00:17:59.074 --> 00:18:00.740
you don't even let
them finish the word.

00:18:00.740 --> 00:18:01.610
You say, yes.

00:18:01.610 --> 00:18:03.090
Yes I will.

00:18:03.090 --> 00:18:04.700
I worked on the "Frozen" book.

00:18:04.700 --> 00:18:07.650
And let me tell you, I didn't
stop singing that song.

00:18:07.650 --> 00:18:09.855
I would hear it in
my sleep at night.

00:18:09.855 --> 00:18:10.370
"Let it go."

00:18:10.370 --> 00:18:11.660
I would hear it all the time.

00:18:11.660 --> 00:18:13.002
But it was great.

00:18:13.002 --> 00:18:14.210
It was really fun to work on.

00:18:14.210 --> 00:18:16.340
And I also worked on a
Disney princess book,

00:18:16.340 --> 00:18:19.520
because I love
classic animation.

00:18:19.520 --> 00:18:21.980
And so many of those
Disney princess movies,

00:18:21.980 --> 00:18:24.340
especially things like
"Cinderella" and--

00:18:24.340 --> 00:18:27.950
well, my personal favorite
is "Little Mermaid."

00:18:27.950 --> 00:18:31.850
Those movies really transformed
the artist that I am today.

00:18:31.850 --> 00:18:33.980
So they were really
big influences.

00:18:33.980 --> 00:18:35.690
And so to be able
to work on that

00:18:35.690 --> 00:18:38.600
and to make like Cinderella
super cool, that Cinderella

00:18:38.600 --> 00:18:40.760
actually, she transforms.

00:18:40.760 --> 00:18:43.880
So she's like, oh, I'm
all sad Cinderella.

00:18:43.880 --> 00:18:46.269
And then you pull the
bottom of her skirt thing.

00:18:46.269 --> 00:18:47.810
You don't pull her
skirt, but there's

00:18:47.810 --> 00:18:49.010
a little tab on the bottom.

00:18:49.010 --> 00:18:52.520
And it transforms into
like super fab Cinderella.

00:18:52.520 --> 00:18:54.320
So it was really cool.

00:18:54.320 --> 00:18:55.810
That was a hard pop to design.

00:19:07.031 --> 00:19:07.530
Oh.

00:19:07.530 --> 00:19:10.240
Oh, well, of course, in one
of my most recent books,

00:19:10.240 --> 00:19:13.510
something I know that everyone
here at Google loves, LEGO.

00:19:13.510 --> 00:19:15.711
So a couple of years ago,
the LEGO folks came to me.

00:19:15.711 --> 00:19:17.710
And they said would, you
want to do a LEGO book.

00:19:17.710 --> 00:19:20.800
And I didn't even let them
finish that sentence, either.

00:19:20.800 --> 00:19:24.940
Yes, totally-- I grew
up building with LEGO.

00:19:24.940 --> 00:19:27.640
But back when I was young, we
didn't have all the cool sets

00:19:27.640 --> 00:19:28.840
that you guys have now.

00:19:28.840 --> 00:19:31.180
We just had
whatever-- six colors.

00:19:31.180 --> 00:19:34.460
And I think we
had wheels, maybe.

00:19:34.460 --> 00:19:37.030
But it was-- we never-- when
you would make something,

00:19:37.030 --> 00:19:38.770
it never looked like one object.

00:19:38.770 --> 00:19:40.630
It always just kind
of look a bunch

00:19:40.630 --> 00:19:42.910
of different bricks stuck
together, whereas now, you

00:19:42.910 --> 00:19:44.850
have so many different pieces.

00:19:44.850 --> 00:19:47.170
It's-- I actually, when I
was researching this book,

00:19:47.170 --> 00:19:51.340
I tried to get the LEGO people
to tell me a number of all

00:19:51.340 --> 00:19:55.030
the different pieces that
they've ever made-- not color,

00:19:55.030 --> 00:19:56.729
but the types of pieces.

00:19:56.729 --> 00:19:58.270
And they couldn't
even give it to me.

00:19:58.270 --> 00:19:59.500
There's so many
different pieces.

00:19:59.500 --> 00:20:01.124
They don't even have
a number for that.

00:20:01.124 --> 00:20:03.220
So when I worked on
this book, I actually

00:20:03.220 --> 00:20:06.970
went to the LEGO headquarters
in Billund, in Denmark.

00:20:06.970 --> 00:20:10.010
I went to their special
design headquarters,

00:20:10.010 --> 00:20:11.751
which is this big,
white, sort of big--

00:20:11.751 --> 00:20:13.750
I think they call it the
white box or something.

00:20:13.750 --> 00:20:15.400
And I can't tell you
what was in there.

00:20:15.400 --> 00:20:16.760
But it was awesome.

00:20:16.760 --> 00:20:17.680
It was awesome.

00:20:17.680 --> 00:20:22.150
And it's really-- they're
such artists that work there.

00:20:22.150 --> 00:20:24.460
It's incredible
how they figure out

00:20:24.460 --> 00:20:26.080
how to make these
beautiful things

00:20:26.080 --> 00:20:27.454
with these little
plastic bricks.

00:20:27.454 --> 00:20:29.300
It's incredible.

00:20:29.300 --> 00:20:32.740
So working on this book, my
research was really tough.

00:20:32.740 --> 00:20:34.000
I mean, they had to--

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:37.330
they sent me 200
different LEGO sets.

00:20:37.330 --> 00:20:38.860
And I built LEGOs.

00:20:38.860 --> 00:20:40.160
It was really hard.

00:20:40.160 --> 00:20:43.159
Actually, I got a couple
of interns to help me.

00:20:43.159 --> 00:20:44.200
Because it takes a while.

00:20:44.200 --> 00:20:46.180
I mean, I know some
of the parents know.

00:20:46.180 --> 00:20:50.320
When you get those sets, it
takes a while, especially when

00:20:50.320 --> 00:20:52.430
they're those big ones.

00:20:52.430 --> 00:20:53.590
So we built everything.

00:20:53.590 --> 00:20:55.280
And then we made--

00:20:55.280 --> 00:20:58.300
then made the pops and
then made the artwork.

00:20:58.300 --> 00:21:04.960
Here's a little sample of
what's inside "LEGO Pop-Up."

00:21:04.960 --> 00:21:09.420
And I did the writing, the
pop-ups, and the art in this.

00:21:09.420 --> 00:21:12.220
And there are cool pops
in this that transform.

00:21:12.220 --> 00:21:14.670
This one transforms into
three different things.

00:21:14.670 --> 00:21:16.212
And then there's
tons of many figures

00:21:16.212 --> 00:21:17.420
and all kinds of cool things.

00:21:17.420 --> 00:21:22.220
That's my assistant there,
works in Ninjago, too.

00:21:22.220 --> 00:21:25.040
And it has this huge pop
in it that is super tall.

00:21:25.040 --> 00:21:26.840
It's this big,
tall tower of pops.

00:21:26.840 --> 00:21:29.090
Actually, we're going to
have a giveaway of some books

00:21:29.090 --> 00:21:30.090
later on.

00:21:30.090 --> 00:21:34.424
So think in your mind
about some cool LEGO facts.

00:21:34.424 --> 00:21:35.840
Just think in your
head, and we'll

00:21:35.840 --> 00:21:38.400
get back to that later on.

00:21:38.400 --> 00:21:40.730
So enough already-- see, notes.

00:21:40.730 --> 00:21:43.130
Tell them-- OK, so this
is how I do what I do.

00:21:46.200 --> 00:21:51.350
When I work in my office down
in the West Village, all I do

00:21:51.350 --> 00:21:54.950
is I stick paper in a machine
and pop-up books come out.

00:21:54.950 --> 00:21:55.850
That's how I do it.

00:21:55.850 --> 00:21:56.570
All right, I'm ready.

00:21:56.570 --> 00:21:57.361
I'll see you later.

00:21:57.361 --> 00:22:00.010
No, actually, that's
not what I do.

00:22:00.010 --> 00:22:02.260
Don't you love my angry
face in that picture, too?

00:22:02.260 --> 00:22:04.280
It's like rrr.

00:22:04.280 --> 00:22:05.390
That's not how it's done.

00:22:05.390 --> 00:22:06.890
It's actually a
really long process.

00:22:06.890 --> 00:22:11.690
Making a pop-up book sometimes
takes from four to six months

00:22:11.690 --> 00:22:14.190
to make a whole book from
the beginning to the end.

00:22:14.190 --> 00:22:15.920
And then most of
that work has to be

00:22:15.920 --> 00:22:20.030
done about eight months before
it's actually on the shelves.

00:22:20.030 --> 00:22:22.700
Because after I
make one book, there

00:22:22.700 --> 00:22:24.410
has to be a whole
group of people that

00:22:24.410 --> 00:22:26.690
help me make thousands more.

00:22:26.690 --> 00:22:27.740
So here's how it's done.

00:22:30.680 --> 00:22:33.037
First, of course, I have
to get ideas for things.

00:22:33.037 --> 00:22:34.120
I have to get inspiration.

00:22:34.120 --> 00:22:35.780
I look all around me.

00:22:35.780 --> 00:22:38.590
I look at the world everywhere
and try to take inspiration

00:22:38.590 --> 00:22:40.390
from anything I can see.

00:22:40.390 --> 00:22:42.430
You're lucky that you
guys are in New York.

00:22:42.430 --> 00:22:43.412
There's so much here.

00:22:43.412 --> 00:22:45.370
And I think most of the
pictures that are here,

00:22:45.370 --> 00:22:47.410
I took in New York.

00:22:47.410 --> 00:22:51.010
There's so much,
there's so much to see.

00:22:51.010 --> 00:22:52.930
But I think that you
can be anywhere and be

00:22:52.930 --> 00:22:54.190
inspired by things.

00:22:54.190 --> 00:22:57.010
So I take inspiration
from everywhere.

00:22:57.010 --> 00:22:59.597
And sometimes, you can see the
way that something is built.

00:22:59.597 --> 00:23:01.930
And that might inspire you
to make something really cool

00:23:01.930 --> 00:23:04.530
in a pop-up book.

00:23:04.530 --> 00:23:06.942
So the tools I use
making pop-ups--

00:23:06.942 --> 00:23:08.650
of course, after I've
written the story--

00:23:12.620 --> 00:23:13.280
paper.

00:23:13.280 --> 00:23:14.790
Yeah, I use a lot of cardstock.

00:23:14.790 --> 00:23:16.814
I usually work in
white cardstock.

00:23:16.814 --> 00:23:17.730
This is it right here.

00:23:17.730 --> 00:23:18.600
You can get it.

00:23:18.600 --> 00:23:19.740
It's a little heavier
than regular paper.

00:23:19.740 --> 00:23:22.000
You can get it at office
stores and everything.

00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:23.550
And the reason why
I use it in white

00:23:23.550 --> 00:23:25.800
is, first, I want to figure
out what the structure is.

00:23:25.800 --> 00:23:27.750
And then I worry
about coloring it

00:23:27.750 --> 00:23:29.470
or drawing on it or whatever.

00:23:29.470 --> 00:23:33.120
So usually in the beginning,
I just work in white paper.

00:23:33.120 --> 00:23:35.100
I, of course, use tape.

00:23:35.100 --> 00:23:36.900
I use different kinds of tape.

00:23:36.900 --> 00:23:41.940
I use lots of scissors, glue, of
course, glue, an X-Acto knife.

00:23:41.940 --> 00:23:44.940
The X-Acto knife I use to
make really intricate cuts.

00:23:44.940 --> 00:23:47.610
And I need lots of Band-Aids,
because I don't just

00:23:47.610 --> 00:23:49.910
make cuts on the paper.

00:23:49.910 --> 00:23:51.351
Yes, I like Hello Kitty.

00:23:51.351 --> 00:23:51.850
OK.

00:23:56.710 --> 00:23:58.240
So in the beginning,
this is kind

00:23:58.240 --> 00:23:59.920
of a rough pop-up looks like.

00:23:59.920 --> 00:24:02.860
I may have an idea for what is
going to happen on that pop-up

00:24:02.860 --> 00:24:03.550
page--

00:24:03.550 --> 00:24:04.330
just words.

00:24:04.330 --> 00:24:07.090
I will never draw a picture
of what I'm going to make.

00:24:07.090 --> 00:24:10.370
I usually-- I just have a
word of what might happen.

00:24:10.370 --> 00:24:12.130
So I just thought
to myself, I wanted

00:24:12.130 --> 00:24:15.412
to have a pop-up that the
dinosaur bit the reader.

00:24:15.412 --> 00:24:16.870
I thought that
would be really fun.

00:24:16.870 --> 00:24:19.078
Because if you were going
to experience a T-rex, that

00:24:19.078 --> 00:24:20.990
would be the coolest
way to-- well, I mean,

00:24:20.990 --> 00:24:22.180
you wouldn't really
want to be eaten.

00:24:22.180 --> 00:24:24.221
But it would be cool if
they kind of came at you.

00:24:24.221 --> 00:24:25.660
So this is the first version.

00:24:25.660 --> 00:24:27.520
And I'll take it
apart very carefully,

00:24:27.520 --> 00:24:30.430
trace the pieces in the computer
using Adobe Illustrator.

00:24:30.430 --> 00:24:32.140
And I'll make what
are called dyelines.

00:24:32.140 --> 00:24:33.598
And these dye lines
are going to be

00:24:33.598 --> 00:24:35.440
used later on for
when they manufacture

00:24:35.440 --> 00:24:37.400
this thousands of times over.

00:24:37.400 --> 00:24:41.290
So I will remake the pop-up
sometimes up to 10 times

00:24:41.290 --> 00:24:46.670
or even 20 times to make sure
that it works just right.

00:24:46.670 --> 00:24:49.299
And you can see there's even
notes on that and everything.

00:24:49.299 --> 00:24:51.090
And that's what it
looks like in the final.

00:24:51.090 --> 00:24:52.810
Now one of the
things that-- and I

00:24:52.810 --> 00:24:54.490
also make the artwork as well.

00:24:54.490 --> 00:24:56.400
And I'll show you
how I do that also.

00:24:56.400 --> 00:24:59.040
I do a style of artwork
called cut paper collage.

00:24:59.040 --> 00:25:00.810
So I'm cutting out
paper to make the pops.

00:25:00.810 --> 00:25:02.820
I thought it would be
cool to also cut up paper

00:25:02.820 --> 00:25:05.949
to make the art work as well.

00:25:05.949 --> 00:25:08.240
Oh, in the beginning, this
is what a pop-up looks like.

00:25:08.240 --> 00:25:10.250
This is just to get
the movement right.

00:25:10.250 --> 00:25:13.699
Now I actually went and studied
a horse and how it moved.

00:25:13.699 --> 00:25:15.740
And this was going to be
a book-- this book never

00:25:15.740 --> 00:25:16.750
actually came out.

00:25:16.750 --> 00:25:17.490
Oh, well.

00:25:17.490 --> 00:25:20.750
Anyway-- wah, wah,
too bad for you.

00:25:20.750 --> 00:25:21.980
It wasn't that exciting.

00:25:21.980 --> 00:25:22.562
I swear.

00:25:22.562 --> 00:25:23.270
I swear it's not.

00:25:23.270 --> 00:25:26.880
So this is an early prototype
that actually sketches on it.

00:25:26.880 --> 00:25:30.270
This is something that's
called a white dummy.

00:25:30.270 --> 00:25:33.320
And it goes to my editor.

00:25:33.320 --> 00:25:34.869
Now the editor works
at a publisher.

00:25:34.869 --> 00:25:36.410
And she kind of
corrects all my work.

00:25:36.410 --> 00:25:39.285
She kind of-- imagine,
it's like your teacher.

00:25:39.285 --> 00:25:40.910
And she actually goes
through and marks

00:25:40.910 --> 00:25:42.650
things that are written wrong.

00:25:42.650 --> 00:25:44.390
Or she may even mark
some of the pops

00:25:44.390 --> 00:25:46.460
and say, I don't think that this
is a good thing that you should

00:25:46.460 --> 00:25:47.990
do, You should do
something else.

00:25:47.990 --> 00:25:51.879
So she'll-- and just like a
teacher, she marks it in red.

00:25:51.879 --> 00:25:53.420
So it's great when
you get that back.

00:25:53.420 --> 00:25:54.650
But usually, I don't get--

00:25:54.650 --> 00:25:56.630
I do OK with my editors.

00:25:56.630 --> 00:26:02.290
And usually, they're on
the same page, so to speak.

00:26:02.290 --> 00:26:02.870
Uh-huh.

00:26:02.870 --> 00:26:04.010
I didn't mean to do that.

00:26:04.010 --> 00:26:05.232
I'm sorry.

00:26:05.232 --> 00:26:07.014
That's me when we're
making pop-ups.

00:26:07.014 --> 00:26:09.180
And this is just-- show you
some of the details that

00:26:09.180 --> 00:26:13.131
go into making it.

00:26:13.131 --> 00:26:15.130
This is an early version
of the Darth Vader pop.

00:26:15.130 --> 00:26:16.754
This was a really
tough pop-up to make,

00:26:16.754 --> 00:26:20.020
because there's two portions
of Darth Vader's helmet.

00:26:20.020 --> 00:26:22.300
Well, there's actually--
there's three.

00:26:22.300 --> 00:26:23.980
There's-- I don't
want to get into it.

00:26:23.980 --> 00:26:25.188
I'm not going to get into it.

00:26:25.188 --> 00:26:29.710
But anyways, what happens
with this is actually I

00:26:29.710 --> 00:26:31.600
wanted the reader to
be able to see Anakin

00:26:31.600 --> 00:26:34.630
for a couple of seconds before
the mask closed up over him

00:26:34.630 --> 00:26:35.710
when the pop-up opened.

00:26:35.710 --> 00:26:37.210
So you can actually--
if you look

00:26:37.210 --> 00:26:39.370
as it's opening, it's
really important,

00:26:39.370 --> 00:26:42.220
the time-- you can
see him for a second.

00:26:42.220 --> 00:26:44.900
And then it closes
up over his face.

00:26:44.900 --> 00:26:47.200
Because everyone
makes-- everyone notices

00:26:47.200 --> 00:26:48.370
those little things.

00:26:48.370 --> 00:26:50.620
So this took me a
long time to be able--

00:26:50.620 --> 00:26:53.620
and I had to actually engineer
the front part of his face

00:26:53.620 --> 00:26:56.230
separately than the back
and then put them together.

00:26:56.230 --> 00:26:59.050
So it took a lot of time
and a lot of prototypes

00:26:59.050 --> 00:27:01.240
to get it to even
look like this.

00:27:01.240 --> 00:27:04.060
So you see, I kind of
sculpted it in white first.

00:27:04.060 --> 00:27:06.370
And then there's
sketches around it.

00:27:06.370 --> 00:27:11.490
And then, and then, and then--

00:27:11.490 --> 00:27:13.330
oh, that's the wrong thing.

00:27:13.330 --> 00:27:16.931
And then that's the
final color version.

00:27:16.931 --> 00:27:19.430
When I was doing this book, I
actually-- which was awesome--

00:27:19.430 --> 00:27:21.470
I got-- I do get
some perks when I

00:27:21.470 --> 00:27:24.100
work with some of these
different companies and things.

00:27:24.100 --> 00:27:25.970
I got to go to the
Star Wars archives.

00:27:25.970 --> 00:27:29.630
So this was the Lucas Film
Archives in Marin County.

00:27:29.630 --> 00:27:31.370
This was actually
at Skywalker Ranch.

00:27:31.370 --> 00:27:33.161
They don't even let
people go here anymore.

00:27:33.161 --> 00:27:35.300
So I got in there
at the right time.

00:27:35.300 --> 00:27:37.400
And they had all the
masks from the old movies.

00:27:37.400 --> 00:27:39.350
Those are actual
stunt lightsabers.

00:27:39.350 --> 00:27:41.480
That's my editor and
I. We were getting

00:27:41.480 --> 00:27:42.920
ready to fight about something.

00:27:42.920 --> 00:27:45.290
And those are stunt
lightsabers from him.

00:27:45.290 --> 00:27:47.450
And the matte
painting in the back

00:27:47.450 --> 00:27:49.880
is actually used from the
"Empire Strikes Back."

00:27:49.880 --> 00:27:50.780
So I am like--

00:27:50.780 --> 00:27:52.250
I couldn't stop smiling after.

00:27:52.250 --> 00:27:54.020
This was so much fun to go see.

00:27:54.020 --> 00:27:55.876
And did I need to go?

00:27:55.876 --> 00:27:57.500
I remember when my
editor said, oh, you

00:27:57.500 --> 00:27:59.510
think you're going to need
to go to the Lucas Archives

00:27:59.510 --> 00:28:00.330
to look at things?

00:28:00.330 --> 00:28:01.440
Now, I-- no.

00:28:01.440 --> 00:28:05.120
Let me-- at the time, I owned
hundreds of Star Wars books.

00:28:05.120 --> 00:28:06.890
I had every movie.

00:28:06.890 --> 00:28:07.850
I have tons.

00:28:07.850 --> 00:28:09.290
I knew everything about it.

00:28:09.290 --> 00:28:11.540
Of course, I said, yes, I
think I should probably go.

00:28:11.540 --> 00:28:12.680
So I was able to go.

00:28:12.680 --> 00:28:13.947
It was an awesome experience.

00:28:13.947 --> 00:28:15.530
And I've had a lot
of nice experiences

00:28:15.530 --> 00:28:17.330
like that, like
the big fan in me

00:28:17.330 --> 00:28:19.160
gets to go do these cool things.

00:28:19.160 --> 00:28:21.980
This is me working in my
studio-- not this fast.

00:28:21.980 --> 00:28:24.110
This is, yeah-- this is
me working in the studio

00:28:24.110 --> 00:28:25.340
probably over a few hours.

00:28:25.340 --> 00:28:27.010
And I'm designing a pop-up.

00:28:27.010 --> 00:28:29.840
And as you can see,
it's just by hand.

00:28:29.840 --> 00:28:31.250
There's no computer program.

00:28:31.250 --> 00:28:33.470
The computer program
comes in when I actually

00:28:33.470 --> 00:28:35.880
take the pop apart and trace it.

00:28:35.880 --> 00:28:38.780
Now after I've made all those
dyelines, all those lines that

00:28:38.780 --> 00:28:41.479
are tracings of pieces, I
may go in and make artwork.

00:28:41.479 --> 00:28:42.770
Sometimes it's in the computer.

00:28:42.770 --> 00:28:44.360
Sometimes it's by hand.

00:28:44.360 --> 00:28:46.580
And I put the artwork
and those dyelines

00:28:46.580 --> 00:28:49.400
together, rebuild
the pop-up again

00:28:49.400 --> 00:28:51.080
and again to make sure it works.

00:28:51.080 --> 00:28:53.310
And that is how
a pop-up is made.

00:28:53.310 --> 00:28:55.060
This was for the
Transformers pop-up book.

00:28:55.060 --> 00:28:56.560
Like I said, I
love Transformers.

00:28:56.560 --> 00:29:02.540
That was just a quick pop-up
how to make for that book.

00:29:02.540 --> 00:29:04.950
That was an incredible
book to do as well.

00:29:04.950 --> 00:29:07.070
I have a lot of dream
projects that come true.

00:29:07.070 --> 00:29:09.260
People always ask me, you must
not have any more dreams left.

00:29:09.260 --> 00:29:09.950
I'm like, let me tell you.

00:29:09.950 --> 00:29:10.681
I got lots.

00:29:10.681 --> 00:29:12.680
There's always something
else that I want to do.

00:29:12.680 --> 00:29:15.290
I have a lot of dreams.

00:29:15.290 --> 00:29:17.180
This is just a prototype
of what the book was

00:29:17.180 --> 00:29:20.240
like before it was in color.

00:29:20.240 --> 00:29:21.771
And sometimes I do the artwork.

00:29:21.771 --> 00:29:23.520
And sometimes other
people do the artwork.

00:29:23.520 --> 00:29:26.040
Like I said, I worked
with Maurice Sendak once.

00:29:26.040 --> 00:29:27.650
And for this book,
I actually worked

00:29:27.650 --> 00:29:33.050
with a great Transformer artist
named Emiliano Santalucia.

00:29:33.050 --> 00:29:33.800
He lives in Italy.

00:29:33.800 --> 00:29:35.758
I actually never got to
see him the whole time.

00:29:35.758 --> 00:29:37.910
We worked over-- we just
sent things back and forth

00:29:37.910 --> 00:29:39.560
to each other over the internet.

00:29:39.560 --> 00:29:42.110
And I would draw the
initial sort of sketch

00:29:42.110 --> 00:29:44.360
and what he should draw
and made all kinds of notes

00:29:44.360 --> 00:29:46.939
about what, where, and
what it should look like.

00:29:46.939 --> 00:29:48.230
And then he would make the art.

00:29:48.230 --> 00:29:50.260
And then I would put that
with those dyeline pieces.

00:29:50.260 --> 00:29:52.040
So you can see sometimes
for one pop-up,

00:29:52.040 --> 00:29:54.860
there might be 30 different
pieces that work in tandem,

00:29:54.860 --> 00:29:58.460
all these different levers and
different mechanics working

00:29:58.460 --> 00:30:00.380
together.

00:30:00.380 --> 00:30:02.870
Or there may be other times
when I make the artwork myself.

00:30:02.870 --> 00:30:05.337
Now I think about
making a pop-up.

00:30:05.337 --> 00:30:07.670
OK, so there's three different
stages in making pop-ups.

00:30:07.670 --> 00:30:10.270
You have to have the
writing done and the--

00:30:10.270 --> 00:30:12.200
whatever research and writing.

00:30:12.200 --> 00:30:13.506
That's like a cake.

00:30:13.506 --> 00:30:15.380
When you're making a
cake, that's the recipe.

00:30:15.380 --> 00:30:16.254
You got to have that.

00:30:16.254 --> 00:30:17.630
The next step is
the actual cake.

00:30:17.630 --> 00:30:19.295
You're actually going
to bake something.

00:30:19.295 --> 00:30:21.380
So the next step is
actually making the cake.

00:30:21.380 --> 00:30:23.720
And then the artwork
is the frosting to me.

00:30:23.720 --> 00:30:27.420
I love frosting, so
making color artwork.

00:30:27.420 --> 00:30:30.980
Now I said I make a style
called cut paper collage.

00:30:30.980 --> 00:30:34.590
And I actually, by hand, make
all these different types

00:30:34.590 --> 00:30:35.090
of art.

00:30:35.090 --> 00:30:36.048
Sometimes it's digital.

00:30:36.048 --> 00:30:37.132
But usually, it's by hand.

00:30:37.132 --> 00:30:38.506
I take all these
papers that I've

00:30:38.506 --> 00:30:40.520
made in my studio, all
these different textures.

00:30:40.520 --> 00:30:43.140
I have a huge rack of
different new papers

00:30:43.140 --> 00:30:44.810
that we're constantly using.

00:30:44.810 --> 00:30:48.940
And I will show you a
little bit how it's done.

00:30:48.940 --> 00:30:53.610
First, I'll draw a
picture, just very quickly.

00:30:53.610 --> 00:30:56.650
I usually tighten up a sketch.

00:30:56.650 --> 00:31:00.460
And then I'll use
that sketch as my map.

00:31:00.460 --> 00:31:02.980
And I'll cut out sections
of different colored

00:31:02.980 --> 00:31:06.440
paper with my X-Acto knife.

00:31:06.440 --> 00:31:10.160
I'll lay it in the place using
my sketch sort of as a guide.

00:31:10.160 --> 00:31:12.890
And I printed on a
clear piece of plastic.

00:31:12.890 --> 00:31:17.240
Then I'll glue in the different
pieces of colored paper.

00:31:17.240 --> 00:31:19.460
And the glue I use is very
similar to Elmer's glue,

00:31:19.460 --> 00:31:20.360
white glue.

00:31:20.360 --> 00:31:22.790
And then that's what the
final thing will look like.

00:31:22.790 --> 00:31:25.135
And it's a very small
piece of artwork.

00:31:25.135 --> 00:31:27.260
But it may have 20 different
little pieces of paper

00:31:27.260 --> 00:31:28.610
all glued together to make one.

00:31:28.610 --> 00:31:31.340
Sometimes some of
my larger pieces

00:31:31.340 --> 00:31:35.720
may have hundreds of pieces
of paper glued together.

00:31:35.720 --> 00:31:37.661
When I make the artwork
for the pop-up pieces,

00:31:37.661 --> 00:31:38.660
it's a little different.

00:31:38.660 --> 00:31:41.710
I have to make the artwork
like all splatted out.

00:31:41.710 --> 00:31:43.660
And it almost looks like--

00:31:43.660 --> 00:31:45.517
it's like pop-up roadkill.

00:31:45.517 --> 00:31:46.600
They're all over the side.

00:31:46.600 --> 00:31:49.160
There's pieces here and there.

00:31:49.160 --> 00:31:51.080
And after so many
years, I figured out

00:31:51.080 --> 00:31:52.955
where each piece
needs to be and what

00:31:52.955 --> 00:31:54.080
needs to be on which piece.

00:31:54.080 --> 00:31:56.210
So sometimes the head
isn't necessarily connected

00:31:56.210 --> 00:31:57.050
to the body.

00:31:57.050 --> 00:32:00.320
So I figured it out
after a long time.

00:32:00.320 --> 00:32:03.920
But the one thing I don't
really say to you guys--

00:32:03.920 --> 00:32:05.390
didn't say that earlier--

00:32:05.390 --> 00:32:07.970
was there a lot of
mistakes along the way.

00:32:07.970 --> 00:32:11.480
I don't just start out and
have the perfect idea at first.

00:32:11.480 --> 00:32:12.800
And it all looks great.

00:32:12.800 --> 00:32:15.260
For every wow
pop-up that you see,

00:32:15.260 --> 00:32:19.640
there's a lot of not so
wows that get thrown out.

00:32:19.640 --> 00:32:22.400
And that's the way
I figure things out.

00:32:22.400 --> 00:32:24.260
I sort of--

00:32:24.260 --> 00:32:26.600
I will make something and
see if it's something I like.

00:32:26.600 --> 00:32:29.490
If it's not, then I try
something different.

00:32:29.490 --> 00:32:32.660
And that's-- hopefully you
guys can get from this,

00:32:32.660 --> 00:32:33.890
it doesn't come out perfect.

00:32:33.890 --> 00:32:35.810
And it's OK, because
we're supposed

00:32:35.810 --> 00:32:37.610
to learn from our mistakes.

00:32:37.610 --> 00:32:41.360
I've made so many of them,
you wouldn't even know.

00:32:41.360 --> 00:32:45.680
And it's OK to do that, because
that's how we get better.

00:32:45.680 --> 00:32:47.744
So I've made up one pop-up.

00:32:47.744 --> 00:32:48.660
I've made all the art.

00:32:48.660 --> 00:32:50.160
I've made all the pops.

00:32:50.160 --> 00:32:52.260
And I've made all the words.

00:32:52.260 --> 00:32:53.010
Now what do I do?

00:32:53.010 --> 00:32:54.030
So I send all that.

00:32:54.030 --> 00:32:55.770
And I send one
pop-up book that I

00:32:55.770 --> 00:32:58.440
made by hand to a manufacturer.

00:32:58.440 --> 00:33:01.910
And they're actually-- pop-up
books are hand-manufactured.

00:33:01.910 --> 00:33:06.090
Once I make one pop-up
book, the next step

00:33:06.090 --> 00:33:10.620
is sending all that
information to a printer

00:33:10.620 --> 00:33:13.050
and a hand-assembly
manufacturer.

00:33:13.050 --> 00:33:15.550
And so that's all set.

00:33:15.550 --> 00:33:17.691
Usually, the work
is done overseas.

00:33:17.691 --> 00:33:20.190
And I've worked with a lot of
these manufacturers for years,

00:33:20.190 --> 00:33:22.148
so they understand how
to put together pop-ups.

00:33:22.148 --> 00:33:26.370
In fact, they're more of
experts in assembling pop-ups

00:33:26.370 --> 00:33:27.291
than I could ever be.

00:33:27.291 --> 00:33:28.290
And they tell me things.

00:33:28.290 --> 00:33:29.040
This doesn't work.

00:33:29.040 --> 00:33:29.850
This will work.

00:33:29.850 --> 00:33:31.154
Here's some ideas about things.

00:33:31.154 --> 00:33:32.820
So what they'll do
is they'll break down

00:33:32.820 --> 00:33:34.890
the book into different groups.

00:33:34.890 --> 00:33:38.250
And one group will make
just one page of a book.

00:33:38.250 --> 00:33:41.990
And so each person,
they'll remake--

00:33:41.990 --> 00:33:43.870
each person will make
one section of it.

00:33:43.870 --> 00:33:47.100
So for example, this
Atat here, one person

00:33:47.100 --> 00:33:50.100
will assemble this leg and
hand it off to the next person.

00:33:50.100 --> 00:33:52.650
And there will be a large group
that just works on this page.

00:33:52.650 --> 00:33:53.775
And they'll make thousands.

00:33:53.775 --> 00:33:57.390
Sometimes they can make up
to, like, 15,000 a week.

00:33:57.390 --> 00:34:00.300
They're really hand-- they're
really incredibly skilled hand

00:34:00.300 --> 00:34:01.230
laborers.

00:34:01.230 --> 00:34:03.570
And they oftentimes
come up with ideas

00:34:03.570 --> 00:34:06.090
that are way better than
what I come up with.

00:34:06.090 --> 00:34:09.420
So I work the entire time
during that production,

00:34:09.420 --> 00:34:12.270
which is usually, like I
said, about eight months

00:34:12.270 --> 00:34:14.040
before a book hits the shelves.

00:34:14.040 --> 00:34:15.840
So they'll send me prototypes.

00:34:15.840 --> 00:34:18.048
And then once they actually
start building the books,

00:34:18.048 --> 00:34:20.460
they can make up
to 15,000 a week.

00:34:20.460 --> 00:34:22.199
They'll package them up.

00:34:22.199 --> 00:34:24.770
After they've made each spread,
they'll glue them together.

00:34:24.770 --> 00:34:26.159
Then they'll glue a cover on it.

00:34:26.159 --> 00:34:28.110
They'll clamp
them, let them dry.

00:34:28.110 --> 00:34:30.750
And then they will get
shipped off in boxes

00:34:30.750 --> 00:34:31.960
all over the world.

00:34:31.960 --> 00:34:36.630
So it kind of goes from my
hands creating the original book

00:34:36.630 --> 00:34:41.389
to the manufacturer's hands to
your hands in the bookstores.

00:34:41.389 --> 00:34:42.960
So it's really too cool.

00:34:42.960 --> 00:34:45.659
But there are a lot of
products that we don't realize

00:34:45.659 --> 00:34:48.389
are made by hand when they are.

00:34:48.389 --> 00:34:50.400
There isn't some
giant machine that

00:34:50.400 --> 00:34:52.080
will do all this work for us.

00:34:52.080 --> 00:34:55.889
There are some really
intricate things that we have

00:34:55.889 --> 00:34:56.909
and that we buy.

00:34:56.909 --> 00:34:59.590
And there are hands
that go into it.

00:34:59.590 --> 00:35:02.790
So now I'm going to show you--
now that I've talked about

00:35:02.790 --> 00:35:05.130
myself enough--

00:35:05.130 --> 00:35:07.237
we're going to make
a pop right here.

00:35:07.237 --> 00:35:08.820
And I'm going to
show you some basics.

00:35:11.610 --> 00:35:15.420
But I'm going to need an
idea for what I should make.

00:35:15.420 --> 00:35:20.160
Now last time, someone came
up with a really crazy idea.

00:35:20.160 --> 00:35:23.760
And I did it, of course.

00:35:23.760 --> 00:35:27.087
But it was something.

00:35:27.087 --> 00:35:27.920
It was pretty funny.

00:35:27.920 --> 00:35:29.050
So anyone got an idea?

00:35:29.050 --> 00:35:30.216
You want to raise your hand.

00:35:30.216 --> 00:35:32.680
And I'll pick-- let's see.

00:35:32.680 --> 00:35:33.320
Let's see.

00:35:33.320 --> 00:35:34.950
Thing OK, you.

00:35:34.950 --> 00:35:37.240
Yes.

00:35:37.240 --> 00:35:38.740
Plants?

00:35:38.740 --> 00:35:39.580
OK.

00:35:39.580 --> 00:35:40.660
That works.

00:35:40.660 --> 00:35:41.720
Well, I like this green.

00:35:41.720 --> 00:35:44.470
So I'm going to use that for
the actual plants, I think.

00:35:44.470 --> 00:35:46.300
So what I'm going to start
with is just this cardstock.

00:35:46.300 --> 00:35:47.508
I'm going to fold it in half.

00:35:50.080 --> 00:35:52.821
Oh, I've already got an idea.

00:35:52.821 --> 00:35:54.770
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

00:35:54.770 --> 00:35:56.260
Oh, yeah.

00:35:56.260 --> 00:35:58.222
So-- OK, we're
going to start off.

00:35:58.222 --> 00:35:59.680
This is-- we took
a piece of paper.

00:35:59.680 --> 00:36:01.990
And we're going to fold it
in half, just like that.

00:36:01.990 --> 00:36:02.860
All right.

00:36:02.860 --> 00:36:07.120
And just for the sake of
being able to see it on video,

00:36:07.120 --> 00:36:09.970
I'm going to make a
line down the center

00:36:09.970 --> 00:36:11.270
so it's a little easier to see.

00:36:11.270 --> 00:36:13.000
So you see that center line?

00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:15.340
We're going to-- when we
make some of our pieces,

00:36:15.340 --> 00:36:16.360
we're going to align it.

00:36:16.360 --> 00:36:18.280
We're going to line up
the folds on things.

00:36:18.280 --> 00:36:20.290
Because that's a lot of
what pop-up people do.

00:36:20.290 --> 00:36:23.470
They line up different folds
to make sure things work right.

00:36:23.470 --> 00:36:26.700
So one of the things
I'm going to make

00:36:26.700 --> 00:36:28.060
is something called a V-fold.

00:36:28.060 --> 00:36:31.180
And a V-fold is actually--
well, it's shaped like a V.

00:36:31.180 --> 00:36:35.110
And most of the pop-up
in most of my books

00:36:35.110 --> 00:36:37.780
use some form of V-fold.

00:36:37.780 --> 00:36:39.010
That's not a good one.

00:36:39.010 --> 00:36:41.530
OK, see this big dinosaur?

00:36:41.530 --> 00:36:47.900
See this piece
underneath his body here?

00:36:47.900 --> 00:36:51.140
That-- and it's sort
of triangular and V--

00:36:51.140 --> 00:36:52.040
so that's a V.

00:36:52.040 --> 00:36:54.020
And you can see that it moves.

00:36:54.020 --> 00:36:57.100
It actually is forcing all
these pieces to move up.

00:36:57.100 --> 00:37:00.410
So a V-fold moves.

00:37:00.410 --> 00:37:03.160
And so what I'm going to do is
I'm going to make two V-folds.

00:37:03.160 --> 00:37:05.900
And I'm going make
two V-folds that are--

00:37:05.900 --> 00:37:07.120
they're both right angles.

00:37:07.120 --> 00:37:11.110
Right angles are 90
degree angles, right?

00:37:11.110 --> 00:37:13.600
Correct-- I mean, correct.

00:37:13.600 --> 00:37:14.850
So let's see here.

00:37:14.850 --> 00:37:16.310
I'm going to take a piece of--

00:37:16.310 --> 00:37:17.685
I'm going take a
different piece.

00:37:17.685 --> 00:37:20.940
I'm going to take gray so
that you can see these pieces.

00:37:20.940 --> 00:37:23.190
And what I'm going to do is
I'm going to make-- first,

00:37:23.190 --> 00:37:25.680
I'm going to make a square,
a small square, out of paper.

00:37:25.680 --> 00:37:30.760
And then I'm going to make two
triangles from that square.

00:37:30.760 --> 00:37:32.800
And you say, Matthew,
how can that be done?

00:37:32.800 --> 00:37:33.670
I just don't know.

00:37:33.670 --> 00:37:37.065
Well, OK, so I just
folded a rectangle, right?

00:37:37.065 --> 00:37:39.130
And now-- correct, I mean.

00:37:39.130 --> 00:37:41.650
Because if I say right
angle, it's very confusing.

00:37:41.650 --> 00:37:45.860
So then I'm going to fold
this triangle down like this.

00:37:50.190 --> 00:38:01.240
And I'll be able to see if I
cut it along the edge like that

00:38:01.240 --> 00:38:03.690
and like that.

00:38:03.690 --> 00:38:05.717
Then we have a square.

00:38:05.717 --> 00:38:08.050
Because this side, this side,
this side, and this side--

00:38:08.050 --> 00:38:09.500
it's pretty close.

00:38:09.500 --> 00:38:11.340
It's pretty close.

00:38:11.340 --> 00:38:13.910
And we need two
triangles that are--

00:38:13.910 --> 00:38:15.600
oh, if I cut this
down the middle,

00:38:15.600 --> 00:38:18.720
I get two triangles
that are equal, right?

00:38:18.720 --> 00:38:20.760
We're learning
geometry too, today.

00:38:20.760 --> 00:38:22.706
Good thing you're not in school.

00:38:22.706 --> 00:38:23.580
You know, it's funny.

00:38:23.580 --> 00:38:26.040
People say all the time, you
must have been really good

00:38:26.040 --> 00:38:26.810
at geometry.

00:38:26.810 --> 00:38:27.742
And I don't remember.

00:38:27.742 --> 00:38:28.450
I don't think I--

00:38:28.450 --> 00:38:30.360
I think I-- no, I wasn't.

00:38:30.360 --> 00:38:33.450
I was not a great math student.

00:38:33.450 --> 00:38:34.290
I did OK.

00:38:34.290 --> 00:38:38.790
But calculus-- oh,
man, did that kill me.

00:38:38.790 --> 00:38:40.570
So there-- we have
two triangles.

00:38:40.570 --> 00:38:42.570
And what we're going to
do is fold them in half.

00:38:42.570 --> 00:38:44.940
And we're going to
make two V-folds.

00:38:44.940 --> 00:38:47.710
There's one.

00:38:47.710 --> 00:38:50.720
And the fold where the V is
is going to be down here.

00:38:50.720 --> 00:38:53.270
And here's the second one.

00:38:53.270 --> 00:38:56.540
And we're going to tape
these onto our base.

00:38:56.540 --> 00:38:58.070
And you know what
I'm going to do?

00:38:58.070 --> 00:39:02.440
I'm going to make a line on
that fold, just so we know--

00:39:02.440 --> 00:39:03.572
so you can see it better.

00:39:03.572 --> 00:39:05.530
Because last time, we,
couldn't see it as well.

00:39:13.130 --> 00:39:15.057
My shirt is really
open, isn't it?

00:39:15.057 --> 00:39:15.831
Yikes!

00:39:15.831 --> 00:39:18.050
I'm giving you a lot
of cleavage today.

00:39:18.050 --> 00:39:23.205
All right, so here
are our V-folds.

00:39:23.205 --> 00:39:24.830
And we're going to
have them actually--

00:39:24.830 --> 00:39:26.660
when we glue them
onto to the page,

00:39:26.660 --> 00:39:28.500
we're going to have them point--

00:39:28.500 --> 00:39:30.050
the points touching.

00:39:30.050 --> 00:39:36.380
So we're going to make sure that
that center line on the top V

00:39:36.380 --> 00:39:41.812
is lined up with the
main base, page one.

00:39:41.812 --> 00:39:46.580
And we're going to do the same
on the bottom, just like that.

00:39:46.580 --> 00:39:51.030
It kind of looks like an
hourglass a little bit, right?

00:39:51.030 --> 00:39:55.650
And I'm going to use some
white tape, if I have it.

00:39:55.650 --> 00:39:56.460
Yes.

00:39:56.460 --> 00:40:00.930
So I use this tape that's
very similar to masking tape

00:40:00.930 --> 00:40:01.640
in my studio.

00:40:01.640 --> 00:40:03.300
It's artist tape.

00:40:03.300 --> 00:40:08.350
And we're going to tape along
the V. Because it's a V-fold.

00:40:13.490 --> 00:40:21.050
And there is one lined
up just like that.

00:40:21.050 --> 00:40:22.730
And I always make
sure that I push--

00:40:22.730 --> 00:40:25.337
I make sure that that tape
is really secure on there.

00:40:25.337 --> 00:40:26.670
So now we can see when it moves.

00:40:26.670 --> 00:40:31.430
See, there's one V.
Now we want another V.

00:40:31.430 --> 00:40:34.449
But it's going to
go the other way.

00:40:34.449 --> 00:40:36.740
Actually, I'm going to move
it more towards the middle.

00:40:39.642 --> 00:40:40.600
That's the other thing.

00:40:40.600 --> 00:40:42.130
You can't be--
don't be afraid when

00:40:42.130 --> 00:40:43.360
you're making these pop-ups.

00:40:43.360 --> 00:40:46.360
Don't be afraid to
pick up the pieces

00:40:46.360 --> 00:40:50.490
and move them around if you
don't like the way they are.

00:40:50.490 --> 00:40:52.900
You can always change.

00:40:52.900 --> 00:40:56.710
You can always remake
and fix your mistakes.

00:40:56.710 --> 00:40:59.110
Just by the way, I also--

00:40:59.110 --> 00:41:02.020
I'm supposed to remember
all my social media stuff.

00:41:02.020 --> 00:41:03.460
Because I'm not real good at it.

00:41:03.460 --> 00:41:07.900
So I have a YouTube page where
you can make your own pops.

00:41:07.900 --> 00:41:09.670
If you look up
Matthew Reinhart, it's

00:41:09.670 --> 00:41:12.129
called "Let's Make It Pop."

00:41:12.129 --> 00:41:13.295
And I have different crafts.

00:41:13.295 --> 00:41:15.140
I'm trying to do
them every week.

00:41:15.140 --> 00:41:17.800
So if I miss a week,
please don't get mad at me.

00:41:17.800 --> 00:41:19.460
But there's always
different things.

00:41:19.460 --> 00:41:22.510
In fact, tomorrow is
national superhero day.

00:41:22.510 --> 00:41:24.400
So wear your cape.

00:41:24.400 --> 00:41:25.170
OK?

00:41:25.170 --> 00:41:27.003
Anyways, tomorrow is
national superhero day.

00:41:27.003 --> 00:41:30.460
And there's a pop-up superhero
card that we made for--

00:41:30.460 --> 00:41:31.900
and I think it went up today.

00:41:31.900 --> 00:41:33.940
So you can make your
own superhero card.

00:41:33.940 --> 00:41:37.210
So there's one V. And I'm going
to attach the second V. I know,

00:41:37.210 --> 00:41:37.720
a plant.

00:41:37.720 --> 00:41:38.470
I'm going a plant.

00:41:41.278 --> 00:41:42.410
I'm going to attach this.

00:41:45.384 --> 00:41:47.050
And then what we're
going to do, once we

00:41:47.050 --> 00:41:50.080
have these two Vs working
in opposite directions,

00:41:50.080 --> 00:41:51.790
then we're going
to make something--

00:41:51.790 --> 00:41:53.470
it's a mechanism.

00:41:53.470 --> 00:41:55.090
Here, I'm going to show you.

00:41:55.090 --> 00:41:56.510
There are the two, all right?

00:41:56.510 --> 00:41:58.510
And look, they're going
in different directions.

00:41:58.510 --> 00:41:59.230
One's going up.

00:41:59.230 --> 00:42:00.880
One's going down.

00:42:00.880 --> 00:42:07.710
What's cool about this is one
side, like this lower triangle

00:42:07.710 --> 00:42:10.720
here, if we attach
something to the edge

00:42:10.720 --> 00:42:16.150
here, on the opposite side on
the top on that same edge--

00:42:16.150 --> 00:42:17.549
so on the opposite side.

00:42:17.549 --> 00:42:18.090
So let's see.

00:42:18.090 --> 00:42:20.350
I'm looking at myself on
the-- there and there.

00:42:20.350 --> 00:42:22.710
So if we make a
bridge going across--

00:42:22.710 --> 00:42:23.840
if we make a bridge going--

00:42:23.840 --> 00:42:25.631
I was trying to watch
myself in this thing.

00:42:25.631 --> 00:42:27.770
And I was like, wait,
what's going on?

00:42:27.770 --> 00:42:31.710
If we make a bridge going
across, we'll actually--

00:42:31.710 --> 00:42:33.310
we'll be able to
connect the two.

00:42:33.310 --> 00:42:36.090
And we'll make a pop-up that
kind of expands and twists.

00:42:36.090 --> 00:42:37.660
So it's really cool.

00:42:37.660 --> 00:42:39.450
So the next thing
we're going to do

00:42:39.450 --> 00:42:45.150
is we're going to kind of make
a little bit thinner, longer,

00:42:45.150 --> 00:42:48.230
sort of bridge piece.

00:42:48.230 --> 00:42:52.020
And I'm going to mark
with another color

00:42:52.020 --> 00:42:54.575
the edges that we're
going to connect.

00:42:58.210 --> 00:43:01.190
Can you guys see
that there, there?

00:43:01.190 --> 00:43:04.400
And then I'm going to see--

00:43:04.400 --> 00:43:04.950
did I make?

00:43:04.950 --> 00:43:06.241
I didn't make that long enough.

00:43:08.680 --> 00:43:10.690
If you saw my studio,
it is a wreck.

00:43:10.690 --> 00:43:12.370
I mean, there's
paper everywhere.

00:43:12.370 --> 00:43:15.074
Sometimes I'll come out of
my office after a long day,

00:43:15.074 --> 00:43:16.490
and I'll just have
paper all over.

00:43:16.490 --> 00:43:18.700
I won't even realize it.

00:43:18.700 --> 00:43:20.320
And people like--
you'll get home.

00:43:20.320 --> 00:43:22.630
And it's like, there's
something on your shirt.

00:43:22.630 --> 00:43:26.650
And it's like this huge piece
of paper or half of a pop-up.

00:43:26.650 --> 00:43:28.540
Nobody told me this
on the way out?

00:43:28.540 --> 00:43:31.930
OK so, it's going to go across.

00:43:31.930 --> 00:43:33.850
The only thing that
is not going to work

00:43:33.850 --> 00:43:36.450
is we need to snip off this
little bit and this little bit.

00:43:36.450 --> 00:43:44.590
So I'm just going to use my
marker and roughly get a line.

00:43:47.330 --> 00:43:50.834
So there, you can see where
I'm supposed to cut it.

00:43:50.834 --> 00:43:58.930
I'm going to snip and
snip, use my tape.

00:43:58.930 --> 00:44:00.710
And we're going to attach this.

00:44:00.710 --> 00:44:04.200
And what's cool with
this is we're going

00:44:04.200 --> 00:44:06.320
to do a part where it kind of--

00:44:06.320 --> 00:44:12.810
OK, so now, we are going to
attach it from under here.

00:44:12.810 --> 00:44:15.020
We'll have the tape go up.

00:44:15.020 --> 00:44:18.530
Like I said, this pop-up
is called a twister

00:44:18.530 --> 00:44:19.310
because it twists.

00:44:19.310 --> 00:44:21.320
Oh, that's cool.

00:44:21.320 --> 00:44:24.440
The reminder-- Matthew,
please shut up soon.

00:44:24.440 --> 00:44:25.400
All right, here we go.

00:44:28.010 --> 00:44:31.772
All right, so now, it's attached
from here all the way across.

00:44:31.772 --> 00:44:32.480
There's a bridge.

00:44:32.480 --> 00:44:38.140
And when we close it, see
how it's sort of bowing?

00:44:38.140 --> 00:44:39.350
We don't want that.

00:44:39.350 --> 00:44:40.270
I mean, come on, man.

00:44:42.449 --> 00:44:43.990
Just going to make
sure it's attached

00:44:43.990 --> 00:44:46.949
right and that you have your
tape on there pretty hard.

00:44:46.949 --> 00:44:48.490
All right, so we're
going to fold it.

00:44:48.490 --> 00:44:50.470
And it's going to
sort of arc like that.

00:44:50.470 --> 00:44:52.719
And what's going to happen
is you're going to fold it.

00:44:52.719 --> 00:44:55.630
And it will-- you're
going to find the fold.

00:44:55.630 --> 00:44:59.740
So you're going to kind
of press down on your pop

00:44:59.740 --> 00:45:02.090
and smash it a little.

00:45:02.090 --> 00:45:06.220
So now, I'm a very
sensitive artist, OK?

00:45:06.220 --> 00:45:09.650
So when I open this, I need
positive reinforcement.

00:45:09.650 --> 00:45:12.130
So I'm going to need
to say, like, ooh,

00:45:12.130 --> 00:45:14.535
like be really surprised and
excited when you see it, OK.

00:45:14.535 --> 00:45:15.600
Let me make sure.

00:45:15.600 --> 00:45:16.480
OK.

00:45:16.480 --> 00:45:17.582
All right.

00:45:17.582 --> 00:45:19.010
[OOHING]

00:45:19.010 --> 00:45:20.320
Oh, thank god.

00:45:20.320 --> 00:45:21.500
Thank god.

00:45:21.500 --> 00:45:22.000
Wow.

00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:23.590
That's really exciting.

00:45:23.590 --> 00:45:24.430
Wow.

00:45:24.430 --> 00:45:25.840
All right.

00:45:25.840 --> 00:45:28.180
But this is the start of what--

00:45:28.180 --> 00:45:30.800
we can start building
on top of this.

00:45:30.800 --> 00:45:31.990
So let's see.

00:45:31.990 --> 00:45:33.040
Hm.

00:45:33.040 --> 00:45:35.680
What can we-- so we're going
to make a plant, right?

00:45:35.680 --> 00:45:39.415
So first, we need some leaves.

00:45:42.520 --> 00:45:45.130
And every surface
that's here, it

00:45:45.130 --> 00:45:49.280
has potential to become
a part of the pop-up.

00:45:51.917 --> 00:45:53.500
So I'm going to use
double-stick tape.

00:45:53.500 --> 00:45:54.970
Now usually, I use glue.

00:45:54.970 --> 00:45:57.966
But because I don't
have a lot of time--

00:45:57.966 --> 00:45:59.310
there we go.

00:45:59.310 --> 00:46:02.843
So there is a leaf
and another leaf.

00:46:05.560 --> 00:46:07.530
So are you guys
having fun today?

00:46:07.530 --> 00:46:11.640
You learning a lot about what
your moms and dads and everyone

00:46:11.640 --> 00:46:13.470
else, all your parents, do?

00:46:13.470 --> 00:46:15.070
Is it boring?

00:46:15.070 --> 00:46:15.570
No?

00:46:15.570 --> 00:46:16.290
OK, good.

00:46:16.290 --> 00:46:18.060
I didn't think it
would be boring here.

00:46:18.060 --> 00:46:20.143
Every time I pass by here--
so I live in New York.

00:46:20.143 --> 00:46:22.950
I live actually in Chelsea,
a few blocks from here.

00:46:22.950 --> 00:46:25.170
Every time I pass by
the Google building,

00:46:25.170 --> 00:46:27.882
I always think to myself,
god, I want a job there.

00:46:27.882 --> 00:46:29.340
Because everyone
looks like they're

00:46:29.340 --> 00:46:31.060
so having fun and smart.

00:46:31.060 --> 00:46:32.550
And here I am on my bike.

00:46:32.550 --> 00:46:36.090
And I'm covered with paper
and sad and pathetic.

00:46:36.090 --> 00:46:39.510
So there's the
start of my plant.

00:46:39.510 --> 00:46:41.440
Maybe I'll put some leaves here.

00:46:44.020 --> 00:46:48.310
But whatever you're doing
here, it seems exciting.

00:46:48.310 --> 00:46:52.990
And so it's cool to be able to
get an idea of what people do.

00:46:52.990 --> 00:46:54.970
OK, I'm starting
to get more here.

00:46:54.970 --> 00:46:58.420
It's still-- and I'm just
adding pieces of paper.

00:46:58.420 --> 00:46:59.472
Let's see.

00:46:59.472 --> 00:47:01.430
And it doesn't look as
pretty in the beginning.

00:47:01.430 --> 00:47:06.300
Sometimes, it's just
getting those shapes right.

00:47:06.300 --> 00:47:09.690
And here-- see.

00:47:09.690 --> 00:47:10.190
OK.

00:47:10.190 --> 00:47:12.170
Well, they're getting
a little better.

00:47:12.170 --> 00:47:15.100
I mean, they wouldn't be hiring
me for the Google Doodles

00:47:15.100 --> 00:47:18.470
anytime soon on that one.

00:47:18.470 --> 00:47:21.190
Let's see, we also maybe--

00:47:21.190 --> 00:47:24.270
most plants kind of need
a little pot to go in.

00:47:24.270 --> 00:47:29.470
So we'll cut a little
shape down here.

00:47:29.470 --> 00:47:30.990
Oh, by the way--

00:47:30.990 --> 00:47:34.090
should we do that now
while I finish this up?

00:47:34.090 --> 00:47:36.320
We are going to give away--

00:47:36.320 --> 00:47:37.720
how many books do we have?

00:47:37.720 --> 00:47:38.950
Four?

00:47:38.950 --> 00:47:41.260
We have four books to give away.

00:47:41.260 --> 00:47:44.050
Now I'm sorry we
don't have a lot more.

00:47:44.050 --> 00:47:46.640
But that's all we had
to give away for today.

00:47:46.640 --> 00:47:49.280
You can find my books
anywhere, like any bookstore.

00:47:49.280 --> 00:47:53.210
You can find it online at
Amazon, all those places,

00:47:53.210 --> 00:47:55.210
even places like Toys R
Us and things like that.

00:47:55.210 --> 00:47:58.470
So they're everywhere.

00:47:58.470 --> 00:48:00.250
Like I said, I have
a YouTube channel.

00:48:00.250 --> 00:48:02.010
You can find me on Facebook.

00:48:02.010 --> 00:48:06.040
There's a pop-up book
by Matthew Reinhart.

00:48:06.040 --> 00:48:07.390
So I'm all over the place.

00:48:07.390 --> 00:48:10.810
And we're going to do a quick--
we're going to have people--

00:48:10.810 --> 00:48:14.620
if you have a LEGO fact, I
want you to raise your hand.

00:48:14.620 --> 00:48:16.600
And Lauren will pick--

00:48:16.600 --> 00:48:19.210
now you have to tell
us what your fact is.

00:48:19.210 --> 00:48:21.379
And then you get the book.

00:48:21.379 --> 00:48:23.170
So Lauren, why don't
you start going ahead?

00:48:23.170 --> 00:48:25.870
And I'll finish up my pop-up
while you started doing that.

00:48:29.490 --> 00:48:33.480
And you have to speak
up so we can hear you.

00:48:33.480 --> 00:48:34.260
That's part of it.

00:48:34.260 --> 00:48:38.190
You have to-- and
you can make it up.

00:48:38.190 --> 00:48:39.010
All right, shh.

00:48:44.600 --> 00:48:46.350
83-- that's right.

00:48:46.350 --> 00:48:47.820
Give the man a book.

00:48:47.820 --> 00:48:49.320
Congratulations.

00:48:49.320 --> 00:48:51.330
And I will sign
your book at the end

00:48:51.330 --> 00:48:55.370
after we're finished
if you like.

00:48:55.370 --> 00:48:58.900
Oh, the fact was it's been
around-- how many years?

00:48:58.900 --> 00:48:59.741
83 years.

00:49:06.630 --> 00:49:07.130
What?

00:49:07.130 --> 00:49:08.060
OK, go for it.

00:49:15.854 --> 00:49:17.020
Oh, yeah, that sounds right.

00:49:20.500 --> 00:49:23.371
That sounds good.

00:49:23.371 --> 00:49:23.870
Awesome.

00:49:23.870 --> 00:49:24.910
Congratulations.

00:49:32.980 --> 00:49:34.300
That's right.

00:49:34.300 --> 00:49:35.830
And it's actually
in my LEGO pop.

00:49:35.830 --> 00:49:38.140
You get to see that, the
evolution of many figures.

00:49:38.140 --> 00:49:41.500
How many-- now do you guys
have lots of LEGO mini figures?

00:49:41.500 --> 00:49:43.450
It's kind of insane
how many there are now.

00:49:49.370 --> 00:49:52.560
OK, I'm still working on this.

00:49:52.560 --> 00:49:55.440
SPEAKER: LEGO headquarters
are in Denmark.

00:49:55.440 --> 00:49:56.570
MATTHEW REINHART: Shh.

00:49:56.570 --> 00:49:57.330
What?

00:49:57.330 --> 00:49:59.970
SPEAKER: LEGO headquarters
are in Denmark.

00:49:59.970 --> 00:50:02.030
MATTHEW REINHART: Really?

00:50:02.030 --> 00:50:02.900
I mean, yes.

00:50:02.900 --> 00:50:03.410
I mean, yes.

00:50:03.410 --> 00:50:04.820
I thought you said
something about quarters.

00:50:04.820 --> 00:50:05.690
I was like, what?

00:50:05.690 --> 00:50:09.450
Headquarters-- yes, of
course, I was there, totally.

00:50:09.450 --> 00:50:09.950
I'm sorry.

00:50:09.950 --> 00:50:11.990
I'm out of it, you guys.

00:50:11.990 --> 00:50:14.236
All right, so awesome--
congratulations

00:50:14.236 --> 00:50:15.360
everybody who won the book.

00:50:15.360 --> 00:50:20.900
And like I said, I
will definitely--

00:50:20.900 --> 00:50:22.730
so wait, I'm not quite done.

00:50:22.730 --> 00:50:25.340
So she said she wanted a plant.

00:50:25.340 --> 00:50:29.750
But you know, plants aren't
always the most active things.

00:50:29.750 --> 00:50:31.410
Of course, the first
thing she said--

00:50:31.410 --> 00:50:33.600
of when she first said
it, I thought, well,

00:50:33.600 --> 00:50:34.350
I'll make a plant.

00:50:34.350 --> 00:50:38.570
But I'm going to make this
plant into a Venus flytrap.

00:50:38.570 --> 00:50:42.350
Because let's see-- I've
lost some of my-- let's see.

00:50:42.350 --> 00:50:46.945
If I put the neck up
here, oh, yeah, totally.

00:50:46.945 --> 00:50:48.290
Totally.

00:50:48.290 --> 00:50:51.110
I had a friend who was
in one of those musicals.

00:50:51.110 --> 00:50:52.690
And he wasn't so good.

00:50:52.690 --> 00:50:54.397
It was a community theater.

00:50:54.397 --> 00:50:55.730
And I had to go see him sing it.

00:50:55.730 --> 00:50:56.900
He was Seymour.

00:50:56.900 --> 00:50:59.150
He wasn't so good at it.

00:50:59.150 --> 00:51:00.320
So let's see if that works.

00:51:00.320 --> 00:51:01.240
Is that going to work?

00:51:01.240 --> 00:51:02.430
It's going.

00:51:02.430 --> 00:51:04.970
Now like I said, sometimes we
don't get everything right.

00:51:04.970 --> 00:51:07.670
So you got to keep trying.

00:51:07.670 --> 00:51:09.230
Here we go.

00:51:09.230 --> 00:51:11.800
And I lost a leaf in there.

00:51:11.800 --> 00:51:13.410
It's hard to do it on the fly.

00:51:13.410 --> 00:51:15.291
Let's see if that works.

00:51:15.291 --> 00:51:15.790
There we go.

00:51:15.790 --> 00:51:16.900
Now it sticks out.

00:51:16.900 --> 00:51:18.250
I cheated a little bit.

00:51:18.250 --> 00:51:19.480
But there we go.

00:51:19.480 --> 00:51:20.671
Oh, we lost a leaf.

00:51:20.671 --> 00:51:23.760
[APPLAUSE]

00:51:23.760 --> 00:51:24.520
It's not bad.

00:51:24.520 --> 00:51:26.120
I could use a little
bit more work.

00:51:26.120 --> 00:51:28.286
If I had more time, I'd be
able to make some cooler.

00:51:28.286 --> 00:51:30.730
But anyways, thank you so
much for having me today.

00:51:30.730 --> 00:51:32.260
You guys were awesome.

00:51:32.260 --> 00:51:35.440
And if you ever want to
make any pop-ups, go online.

00:51:35.440 --> 00:51:38.188
And have a good day today.

00:51:38.188 --> 00:51:39.040
Bye, you all.

00:51:39.040 --> 00:51:41.790
[APPLAUSE]
