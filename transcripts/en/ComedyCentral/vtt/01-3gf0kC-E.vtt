00:00:00.667 --> 00:00:03.070
TIME FOR TONIGHT'S #HASHTAGWARS.

00:00:03.103 --> 00:00:10.277
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
ALL RIGHT, THE STATE, ONE OF

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:12.279
THE GREATEST SKETCH COMEDY
SHOWS.

00:00:12.312 --> 00:00:13.213
IT WAS ON MTV IN THE 1990s.

00:00:13.247 --> 00:00:15.616
WE WERE THERE AROUND THE SAME
TIME, ALMOST.

00:00:15.649 --> 00:00:17.417
BACK IN THE 1900s.

00:00:17.451 --> 00:00:22.389
&gt;&gt; THE 1990s, KIDS, THAT WAS
BEFORE WE HAD MACHINES!

00:00:22.422 --> 00:00:25.626
(LAUGHTER)
&gt;&gt; Chris: WELL, IN HONOR OF YOUR

00:00:25.659 --> 00:00:28.395
GUYS' SHOW, WE DECIDED TO MAKE
OUR HASHTAG TONIGHT

00:00:28.428 --> 00:00:30.597
#SADTVSHOWS.

00:00:30.631 --> 00:00:33.500
BASICALLY MAKING A T.V. SHOW
TITLE SAD.

00:00:33.534 --> 00:00:36.937
SO INSTANCES WOULD BE "ALL IN
THE DEATH IN THE FAMILY."

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:39.006
OR "SLAVED BY THE BELL."

00:00:39.039 --> 00:00:42.509
OR "RENO 9/11" WOULD BE ANOTHER
VERSION OF THAT.

00:00:42.543 --> 00:00:45.078
(LAUGHTER)
SO I'M GOING TO PUT 60 SECONDS

00:00:45.112 --> 00:00:48.081
ON THE CLOCK STARTING NOW, AND
GO! SHOWALTER?

00:00:48.115 --> 00:00:49.950
&gt;&gt; "THE WHEEL OF MISFORTUNE."

00:00:49.983 --> 00:00:51.185
&gt;&gt; Chris: POINTS!

00:00:51.218 --> 00:00:52.553
KERRI KENNEY?

00:00:52.586 --> 00:00:55.322
&gt;&gt; "HOW I MET THE GUY I THINK
MIGHT BE YOUR FATHER."

00:00:55.355 --> 00:00:56.623
&gt;&gt; Chris: VERY SAD TALE.

00:00:56.657 --> 00:00:57.758

&gt;&gt; THE BRAIDSY BUNCH.

00:01:00.627 --> 00:01:01.728
&gt;&gt; Chris: WHY IS THAT SAD?

00:01:01.762 --> 00:01:03.730
&gt;&gt; IT'S GOT "AIDS" IN THE MIDDLE
OF IT.

00:01:03.764 --> 00:01:06.333
(LAUGHTER)
&gt;&gt; Chris: VERY SAD, POINTS.

00:01:06.366 --> 00:01:08.068
I HAVE TO GIVE HIM POINTS.

00:01:08.101 --> 00:01:09.369

00:01:09.403 --> 00:01:10.971

00:01:13.373 --> 00:01:15.242
&gt;&gt; THE BIG GANG BANG THEORY.

00:01:15.275 --> 00:01:16.743
&gt;&gt; Chris: NOT SO SAD!

00:01:16.777 --> 00:01:19.880
&gt;&gt; IT IS IF IT'S HAPPENING TO
YOU.

00:01:19.913 --> 00:01:21.348
&gt;&gt; Chris: OKAY, POINTS.

00:01:21.381 --> 00:01:22.482

KERRI KENNEY?

00:01:30.157 --> 00:01:32.259
&gt;&gt; "AMERICA'S GOT CRABS."

00:01:32.292 --> 00:01:34.995
&gt;&gt; Chris: TRUE STATEMENT,
ALSO A GREAT POINTS TITLE.

00:01:35.095 --> 00:01:36.330
MIKE BLACK?

00:01:36.363 --> 00:01:37.998

00:01:38.098 --> 00:01:39.266
&gt;&gt; Chris: POINTS.

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:41.101
