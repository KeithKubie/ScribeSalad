A MELISSA DENEE TV SHOW (916)745-2895....

00:00:02.050 --> 00:00:03.360
Hey, what's up guys? We're back today with another dry ice experiment

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:04.980
Dry ice is extremely cold

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:09.300
But it never gets old you've seen people throwing this stuff in their swimming pool where it makes a really cool effect.

00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:14.130
You might remember last summer I went to the hot springs and dumped in a hundred pounds of this stuff to see how it

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:15.299
would react with hot water.

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:20.249
But today the ground is frozen over my fish pond has a thin layer of ice so I wanted to see what would happen if

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:23.819
We tried throwing dry ice into a frozen fish pond. Let's check it out

00:00:28.449 --> 00:00:30.449
(Infomercial time) But wait, there's more!

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:43.410
We're going to throw this bucket of dry ice into our fish pond. And don't worry, there aren't any fish in there now. This just

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:47.399
Froze over last night, so the layer of ice isn't that thick. that means if we throw the dry hard enough

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:48.730
It might be able to penetrate

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:54.000
Straight through down into the water. is the dry ice going to crack through or is it just going to scuttle around on the top?

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:58.619
This will be interesting to see. Let's see what happens if we just throw one chunk of dry ice in there

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:02.980
That's awesome!

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:05.010
But it's gonna take a little bit more to get it through and look

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:07.529
How- wow look at what it's doing to the underneath the ice here?

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:12.119
it's actually forming carbon dioxide gas right underneath the ice. that was unexpected but

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:16.889
I guess it makes sense. Let's throw another piece down there right beside it and see if we get the same effect

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:20.070
Now we need to go all the way through the ice

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:27.179
There we go. Oh, this is actually gonna be really cool. here goes another one right over here

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:37.629
See once the dry ice is under there it releases carbon dioxide, but the carbon dioxide gets trapped under the layer of ice and exposes it

00:01:38.689 --> 00:01:41.139
That's cool. Look closely what happens here

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:47.110
There's an air bubble, and then the carbon dioxide infuses into it, and then it rushes out and disappears. what a sweet effect

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:55.299
What's cool about that? Gas is it's still got that misty foggy vapor. Let's just go ahead and do the whole bucket

00:01:59.659 --> 00:02:01.868
[wow], that is cool

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:15.980
I think the coolest thing about this is just the setting with everything frozen over it kind of looks like one of those foggy

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:21.590
English mornings with the foggy vapor rolling around definitely gives it a different feel than we had at the hot springs.

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:24.010
I could probably like stick my bucket on there

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:26.360
And a bucket just sitting there

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:28.670
~random~

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:35.209
If you get in close here, you can see these bubbles going crazy, and if you listen carefully, it almost sounds like they're squealing

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:43.099
You know what's interesting is a lot of the ice looks like it's kind of disappeared now

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:49.549
It wasn't a very thick layer, but the agitation from all those bubbles must be dissipating that isolator quickly

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:53.150
Look, what's happening to the edges of the ice around where the dry ice went in it's like

00:02:53.640 --> 00:03:00.469
Reforming a frost layer. it might be water spattering out and then refreezing to that ice layer, whatever it is that looks pretty cool

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:05.059
So that is super cool and of course it makes sense that if you trap dry ice underneath the ice

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:07.420
Carbon dioxide is going to build up a layer underneath

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:13.910
Fantastic experiment. I'm really glad that we tried that today, so there you have it very cool experiment throwing dry ice into icy water

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:18.020
Thanks so much for joining me for this video, and I'll be looking for you in the next one. Talk to you then
