00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:04.730
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington DC.

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:21.520
&gt;&gt; Ann Brener: Good morning
my name is Ann Brener

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:25.000
and I am the area specialist
for the Hebraic section

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:26.770
of the Library of Congress.

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:29.430
And I'm going to be giving
a lecture today called,

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:31.480
From "Russia with Love."

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:33.840
And it's all about
illustrated children's books

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:38.780
in Hebrew from 1917 to 1925.

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:41.560
So let's begin.

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:46.370
The world of Hebrew books is
a world of black and white.

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:49.850
Yes, there are the exceptions,
the illuminated manuscripts,

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:53.400
the Haggadah, the brightly
colored artist's books.

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:58.030
But when I am upstairs in our
stacks, amongst the rare books I am

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:02.300
in a fairly sober world of black
and white with shades of brown

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:04.780
and parchment for variation.

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:08.950
So when I opened a folder
one day quite at random

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:11.620
and found myself gazing
down at a book open

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:16.700
to the image you see here
you can imagine my surprise.

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:20.690
It was as though I peeked
into a nest of sparrows only

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:24.900
to find some gorgeous brightly
plumbed bird of paradise.

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:26.370
What was this book?

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:30.430
Clearly a picture book for
children, but a very old one.

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:33.640
And it was this that
surprised me so greatly.

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:36.380
Today of course in Israel
Hebrew picture books

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:39.270
for children are churned
out by the dozens.

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:43.180
But this one was printed in --
and I looked back at the cover,

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:49.010
Moscow-Odessa in a style that
stuns me by its avant-garde beauty

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:52.080
and its width of the early 1900s.

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:57.100
No date, no author, just a title
proclaiming it to be La-Sevivon,

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:02.260
To the Dreidel, published by
Hotz'at Omanut, the Art Press.

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:05.200
In other words, as I
was soon to discover,

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:08.500
one of the very first picture
books ever published for children

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:13.280
in Hebrew, and the story behind
its publication pretty fascinating.

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:18.280
It all began in Moscow,
in the spring of 1917.

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:22.170
Russia was in the throes of
revolution; there were battles

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:25.100
in the streets, barricades
on the corners.

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:28.450
But even that wasn't enough to
stop a group called The Friends

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:33.400
of the Hebrew Language from holding
their annual meeting in Moscow.

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:36.370
Now, this was a group
made up of Jews from all

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:39.220
across the far-flung Russian Empire

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:42.020
and they had some very
distinguished members.

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:44.130
Among them, several
of the richest Jews

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:46.040
in Tsarist [assumed
spelling] Russia,

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:52.080
and also Chaim Nachman Bialik, the
national Hebrew poet whose prestige

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:54.940
in the Jewish world was unmatched.

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:59.430 position:56%
Their one goal, a goal to which they
were passionately committed was a

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:02.670
revival of Hebrew as
a spoken language.

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:06.020
Seeing it as a natural
choice for the pioneers,

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:09.820
rebuilding the Jewish
homeland in Palestina.

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:12.930
[assumed spelling] The meeting
was duly reported afterwards

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:15.130
in the Jewish press.

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:18.670
Here for example, is Hatz
Fera [assumed spelling],

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:22.620
published in Warsaw shortly
after the meeting took place.

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:25.970
The reading as we read,
ended in a resolution

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:28.710
to establish new Hebrew
language kindergartens

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:31.080
and schools throughout Russia.

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:35.500
New publications for children in
Hebrew, evening classes for adults

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:38.310
with Hebrew as a language
of instruction.

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:40.350
Ambitious plans indeed.

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:44.570
Yet the newspaper did not consider
this meeting front page stuff.

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:46.550 position:56%
No, it was buried in the back pages,

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:50.430
page 15 in an issue
with only 16 pages.

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:53.920
Did the editors think that
was just a lot of talk?

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:58.020
Perhaps. There had after
all, been many such meetings

00:03:58.020 --> 00:04:02.460
over that past years, but this
time things were different.

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:04.800
There may have been fighting
out there in the streets

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:08.210
but the revolution was also
a time for great optimism

00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:10.390
and hopes for real change.

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:14.500
Tsarist Russia after all had
been no friend to the Jews

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:17.300
and the ambitious program
hammered out by The Friends

00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:22.330
of the Hebrew Language, was in
fact, incredibly successful.

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:25.300
Now, operating under a new
name Tarbut [assumed spelling],

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:30.420
or Culture, this group opened some
200 new schools and kindergartens

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:34.500
across Russia and others saw
the founding of new presses

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:39.280
for publishing books and
periodicals for children in Hebrew.

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:42.810
One of these new presses
was called Omanut,

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:46.790
and in today's lecture we
will be looking at this press

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:48.710
and at the woman behind it.

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:54.920
Shoshana Zlatopolsky Persitz,
the 24-year-old founder of Omanut

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:58.980
and its guiding spirit
over the years to come.

00:04:58.980 --> 00:05:02.450
Shoshana was a daughter
of Hillel Zlatopolsky,

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:04.850
a sugar tycoon well known

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:08.020
for his generous patronage
of Hebrew culture.

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:10.350
And you can see him here sitting

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:14.580
down on the left, he
looks very dignified.

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:20.360
Hillel Zlatopolsky was for example,
one of the chief patrons of Habima,

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:25.070
the Hebrew theater troop in
Moscow that went on to world fame.

00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:28.650
He also financed this Hebrew
magazine for children,

00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:31.490
founded right in the middle
of the Russian revolution,

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:35.890
Stelem [assumed spelling] with this
beautiful banner on the title page.

00:05:35.890 --> 00:05:39.040
So this was Shoshana's father.

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:43.000
And our heroine was thus brought
up in an atmosphere of culture

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.940
and of reverence for
the Hebrew book.

00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:50.910
In later years she was to recall
her parents' home in Moscow

00:05:50.910 --> 00:05:54.390
as a meeting place for
Hebrew writers and thinkers.

00:05:54.390 --> 00:05:57.530
A place where the Hebrew
book was, as she said,

00:05:57.530 --> 00:05:59.100 position:56%
something sacred, [Speaking Hebrew].

00:05:59.100 --> 00:06:04.160
Yet even as a young girl
she realized the sense

00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:07.200
of futility these Hebrew
writers felt,

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:11.390
their despair at not having
an audience for whom to write.

00:06:11.390 --> 00:06:15.840
So she vows for herself that one
day she would create an audience

00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:18.170
for these writers.

00:06:18.170 --> 00:06:24.160
Now, in 1917 as I have just
mentioned Shoshana was only 24

00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:25.460
years old.

00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:27.440
She was married, and her
husband came from a family came

00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:29.910
from a family very
much like her own.

00:06:29.910 --> 00:06:33.690
That is, a very wealthy Jewish
family passionately devoted

00:06:33.690 --> 00:06:36.020
to Hebrew education and culture.

00:06:36.020 --> 00:06:38.540
So when her father turned 50

00:06:38.540 --> 00:06:41.890
that year she does what
any dutiful daughter does

00:06:41.890 --> 00:06:44.020
for her father's 50th birthday.

00:06:44.020 --> 00:06:47.170
She gave him half a million
rubles and said, daddy,

00:06:47.170 --> 00:06:49.450
let's open a publishing
house for children's books

00:06:49.450 --> 00:06:52.170
in Hebrew, and so they did.

00:06:52.170 --> 00:06:55.010
Thus Omanut Press was born.

00:06:55.010 --> 00:06:57.490
And there you can see their logo.

00:06:57.490 --> 00:07:00.450
It was surely no coincidence

00:07:00.450 --> 00:07:04.520
that Shoshana named her new
publishing house Omanut,

00:07:04.520 --> 00:07:06.230
Art in Hebrew.

00:07:06.230 --> 00:07:10.280
In Russia The World of Art, Mir
iskusstva [assumed spelling],

00:07:10.280 --> 00:07:13.720
was a leading periodical
for the Russia avant-garde.

00:07:13.720 --> 00:07:17.490
And here we see a few
examples from their journals.

00:07:17.490 --> 00:07:20.900
By linking her own venture
to this prestigious arbiter

00:07:20.900 --> 00:07:24.820
of taste Shoshana was
proclaiming her own commitment

00:07:24.820 --> 00:07:28.190
to the highest standards of
modern art and literature.

00:07:28.190 --> 00:07:31.930
And indeed Omanut Press
did become known

00:07:31.930 --> 00:07:34.740
for the beauty of its publications.

00:07:34.740 --> 00:07:39.580
In later years one of Shoshana's
colleagues recalled how Shoshana

00:07:39.580 --> 00:07:42.670
would look at each new book
that came off the press,

00:07:42.670 --> 00:07:46.820
rejoicing not only in the beautiful
Hebrew of the text but also

00:07:46.820 --> 00:07:48.600
in the high quality paper,

00:07:48.600 --> 00:07:52.980
the exquisite black font,
the perfect binding.

00:07:52.980 --> 00:07:56.880
He said that watching Shoshana
look at one of those new books was

00:07:56.880 --> 00:08:01.360
like watching the rabbi back home
in his childhood village as looked

00:08:01.360 --> 00:08:06.390
at his perfect Etrog, or citron
fruit during the Sukkot holiday.

00:08:06.390 --> 00:08:11.370
Both were acts of what is known
in Judaism as Hiddur Mitzvah.

00:08:11.370 --> 00:08:16.750
That is, the sanctification
of Jewish law through deity.

00:08:16.750 --> 00:08:20.430
In creating Omanut Press
Shoshana's goal was

00:08:20.430 --> 00:08:23.110
to make Hebrew the
natural mother tongue

00:08:23.110 --> 00:08:25.590
for the Jewish children in Russia.

00:08:25.590 --> 00:08:28.910
And she decided that the
best way to do this was

00:08:28.910 --> 00:08:33.460
by giving them the very best of
world literature for children.

00:08:33.460 --> 00:08:36.840 position:56%
She wanted to give them the pleasure
that other children experienced

00:08:36.840 --> 00:08:40.960
through the wonderful books of
such authors as Lewis Carrol,

00:08:40.960 --> 00:08:45.100
Charles Dickens, Jules Verne,
but to give it to them in Hebrew.

00:08:45.100 --> 00:08:49.730
A Hebrew that would mold their
tastes and literary expectations

00:08:49.730 --> 00:08:51.910
as they grew into adulthood.

00:08:51.910 --> 00:08:55.120
And indeed it was in
the field of translation

00:08:55.120 --> 00:08:58.160
that Omanut was to become famous.

00:08:58.160 --> 00:09:02.210
But before this goal could be
accomplished tragedy struck.

00:09:02.210 --> 00:09:07.410
And when her four-year-old son
died Shoshana turned her energies

00:09:07.410 --> 00:09:11.860
for a time in another direction,
creating a series of picture books

00:09:11.860 --> 00:09:18.600
for toddlers, which she
named Gamliel, after her son.

00:09:18.600 --> 00:09:23.530
In an interview many years later
Shoshana explained her decision

00:09:23.530 --> 00:09:25.630
to create this series saying,

00:09:25.630 --> 00:09:27.760
that children of other
nations were brought

00:09:27.760 --> 00:09:30.850
up on the wonderful picture
books illustrated by the likes

00:09:30.850 --> 00:09:35.300
of Walter Crane, Arthur
Rackham, and Ivan Biliben.

00:09:35.300 --> 00:09:39.510
But Jewish children -- and this is
a quote, "Have no book to their own

00:09:39.510 --> 00:09:42.030
through to enjoy similar
experience."

00:09:42.030 --> 00:09:46.030
It was thus her personal
tragedy that some

00:09:46.030 --> 00:09:50.760
of the most beautiful Hebrew books
for children were ever created.

00:09:50.760 --> 00:09:53.700
The first three titles
in the Gamliel series

00:09:53.700 --> 00:09:57.940
of picture books were translations
of Russian books together

00:09:57.940 --> 00:10:01.050
with their beautiful
original illustrations.

00:10:01.050 --> 00:10:04.260
I think this must have
been quite a coup Shoshana,

00:10:04.260 --> 00:10:06.260
for she acquired the
publishing rights

00:10:06.260 --> 00:10:08.330
from Konnepell [assumed
spelling] Publishing,

00:10:08.330 --> 00:10:11.950
publisher of the most magnificent
children's books in Moscow

00:10:11.950 --> 00:10:14.500
at the beginning of
the 20th century.

00:10:14.500 --> 00:10:16.980
The Library of Congress owns two

00:10:16.980 --> 00:10:20.450
of these three very,
very rare Hebrew books.

00:10:20.450 --> 00:10:22.560
One of them a translation

00:10:22.560 --> 00:10:26.040
of Hans Christian Andersen's
<i>The Nightingale </i>.

00:10:26.040 --> 00:10:28.570
Another, a swash buckling tale

00:10:28.570 --> 00:10:32.570
of adventure called <i>The
Enchanted Ship </i>with illustrations

00:10:32.570 --> 00:10:37.150
by Dmitry Mitrokhin, a
well-known Russian artist.

00:10:37.150 --> 00:10:42.310 position:56%
Now, although none of the books in
this series is dated I tend to think

00:10:42.310 --> 00:10:46.250
that this, The Enchanted
Ship was the first one,

00:10:46.250 --> 00:10:49.420
and that's because
of the image here.

00:10:49.420 --> 00:10:54.940 position:56%
This image appears on the other side
of the cover and it is full page.

00:10:54.940 --> 00:10:58.880
When I first aw this picture I
just saw logo for the series,

00:10:58.880 --> 00:11:04.320
a stylized plant with the name
Gamliel there at the bottom.

00:11:04.320 --> 00:11:06.950
But now it seems to
me more than that,

00:11:06.950 --> 00:11:11.140
I now see it as stylized
tree of life.

00:11:11.140 --> 00:11:17.460
And the name Gamliel nestling there
so tiny at the root of the tree,

00:11:17.460 --> 00:11:22.080
it turns it into a more memorial
to the publisher's infant son,

00:11:22.080 --> 00:11:27.060 position:56%
the one whose sudden death prompted
this series of Hebrew picture books.

00:11:27.060 --> 00:11:31.100
This picture was commissioned by
Dmitry Mitrokhin, the same artist

00:11:31.100 --> 00:11:35.140
who created the illustration for
the Russian edition of the book.

00:11:35.140 --> 00:11:38.160
And so, far as I know it
does not appear in any

00:11:38.160 --> 00:11:41.490
of the other books from
the Gamliel series.

00:11:41.490 --> 00:11:43.440
To get back to the
first three books,

00:11:43.440 --> 00:11:46.220
before Shoshana could
actually publish any

00:11:46.220 --> 00:11:49.750
of them the Russian
revolution caught up with her

00:11:49.750 --> 00:11:52.150
with the Bolshevik's
nationalizing the press

00:11:52.150 --> 00:11:54.310
and taking over her equipment.

00:11:54.310 --> 00:11:56.000
So just a year after opening

00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:01.050
and before a single book was even
published Omanut closed its doors

00:12:01.050 --> 00:12:05.790
in Russia -- in Moscow and
moved to Odessa, a bustling port

00:12:05.790 --> 00:12:09.910
on the Black Sea located
in the Ukraine and as

00:12:09.910 --> 00:12:13.040
yet untouched by the revolution.

00:12:13.040 --> 00:12:18.250
It was in Odessa therefore that
the first three books were printed,

00:12:18.250 --> 00:12:20.740
and that was only the beginning.

00:12:20.740 --> 00:12:24.590
Odessa was a flourishing
center of Jewish culture,

00:12:24.590 --> 00:12:27.340
home to such luminaries of
modern Hebrew literature

00:12:27.340 --> 00:12:31.210
as Mendele Mocher Sforim
and Chaim Nachman Bialik.

00:12:31.210 --> 00:12:35.480
But the events of 1917 sent
even more Jewish writers

00:12:35.480 --> 00:12:37.570
and artists pouring in.

00:12:37.570 --> 00:12:41.880
With such a stable of local
talent from which to draw Odessa

00:12:41.880 --> 00:12:45.160
to prove fertile ground
indeed for Omanut.

00:12:45.160 --> 00:12:47.790
Bialik's self-created
the text for at least two

00:12:47.790 --> 00:12:50.290
of Omanut's subsequent books,

00:12:50.290 --> 00:12:55.910
one of them a beautiful rhymed
version of a medieval fox fable.

00:12:55.910 --> 00:12:58.670
This is a wonderful book.

00:12:58.670 --> 00:13:03.400 position:56%
If you look closely at the bottom
picture you can see that the chicken

00:13:03.400 --> 00:13:04.700
who is talking with the fox --

00:13:04.700 --> 00:13:07.840
or the rooster rather,
has some crutches.

00:13:07.840 --> 00:13:12.370
This rooster is crippled, and
this poor rooster has hanged back

00:13:12.370 --> 00:13:13.820
from the rest of the crowd.

00:13:13.820 --> 00:13:16.860
But it is this crippled
rooster who saves the day

00:13:16.860 --> 00:13:21.460
and saves the other
roosters from this wily fox.

00:13:21.460 --> 00:13:25.420
Zalman Shneur, another famous
novelist's book in Hebrew

00:13:25.420 --> 00:13:30.490 position:56%
and in Yiddish wrote the poem for To
the Dreidel, the book which we saw

00:13:30.490 --> 00:13:36.320 position:56%
at the beginning of this lecture and
home to that darling goat we all saw

00:13:36.320 --> 00:13:40.360
at the beginning of this slideshow.

00:13:40.360 --> 00:13:43.930
Another book created in
Odessa was a translation

00:13:43.930 --> 00:13:47.090
of Asher Ginzberg renowned
Zionist thinker,

00:13:47.090 --> 00:13:50.630
better known by his
penname Ahad ha-Am.

00:13:50.630 --> 00:13:55.130
And here we have a Hebrew
version of a Russian version

00:13:55.130 --> 00:13:59.650
of what I think is an
Arabic or Persian folktale.

00:13:59.650 --> 00:14:02.650
It's that wonderful folktale
where the father and son go

00:14:02.650 --> 00:14:05.860
out on the donkey and everyone
who comes up to them tells them

00:14:05.860 --> 00:14:09.100
who should be riding the donkey,
either the father or the son.

00:14:09.100 --> 00:14:12.340
So in the end just trying to
please everyone they both get off

00:14:12.340 --> 00:14:15.030
and they both carry the donkey off.

00:14:15.030 --> 00:14:16.330
It's one of those situations

00:14:16.330 --> 00:14:20.390
where no matter what you do
you can't please anybody.

00:14:21.510 --> 00:14:27.340
So we have Chaim Nachman Bialik,
Zalman Shneur, and Ahad ah-Am,

00:14:27.340 --> 00:14:31.580
that's quite a constellation
of writers for Shoshana.

00:14:31.580 --> 00:14:34.760
It was also in Odessa
-- it was also Odessa

00:14:34.760 --> 00:14:38.360
that provided the beautiful
illustrations accompanying these

00:14:38.360 --> 00:14:42.040
and half a dozen other
books in Gamliel series.

00:14:42.040 --> 00:14:45.280
These illustrations were all
created by Jewish art students

00:14:45.280 --> 00:14:50.900 position:56%
in the Odessa school of art, a group
of four young men in their early 20s

00:14:50.900 --> 00:14:54.990
who signed their name
collectively as Havurat tsayarim,

00:14:54.990 --> 00:14:57.410
A Group of Painters in Hebrew.

00:14:57.410 --> 00:15:02.570
Here we see their motto as it
appears on the cover of the books,

00:15:02.570 --> 00:15:05.280
if you follow the arrow it's
there in the left hand corner.

00:15:05.280 --> 00:15:10.870
And here we see it
enlarged and translated.

00:15:10.870 --> 00:15:14.910
History with a capital H
then stepped in once again.

00:15:14.910 --> 00:15:19.710
And as Bolsheviks advance on
the Ukraine Shoshana relocated,

00:15:19.710 --> 00:15:23.240
this time to Frankfurt-am-Main
in Germany.

00:15:23.240 --> 00:15:26.560
There she republished the
beautiful picture books illustrated

00:15:26.560 --> 00:15:29.180 position:56%
by the young art students in Odessa.

00:15:29.180 --> 00:15:33.350 position:56%
It was also in Frankfurt that she
began publishing the polished Hebrew

00:15:33.350 --> 00:15:36.550
translations of world
literature for children,

00:15:36.550 --> 00:15:39.660
by which the press
was to become famous.

00:15:39.660 --> 00:15:43.180
Although published in
Frankfurt the translations came,

00:15:43.180 --> 00:15:46.870
needless to say from
Russia with love.

00:15:46.870 --> 00:15:49.750
One day as Shoshana was
to relate years later --

00:15:49.750 --> 00:15:55.100 position:56%
and I'm quoting, Aris Mirtiksky, the
editor in chief came to Frankfurt

00:15:55.100 --> 00:15:58.690
from Russia, and as he plunked
his suitcase down in front

00:15:58.690 --> 00:16:00.530
of us we all crowded around him.

00:16:00.530 --> 00:16:06.580
Out of that suitcase came nothing
less than 60 Hebrew translations

00:16:06.580 --> 00:16:10.620
of the finest books for children
that world literature could offer.

00:16:10.620 --> 00:16:13.490
Robinson Crusoe, Alice
in Wonderland,

00:16:13.490 --> 00:16:18.340
the tales of Oscar Wilde,
and the list goes on and on.

00:16:18.340 --> 00:16:22.380
In 1925 Omanut left
Europe all together,

00:16:22.380 --> 00:16:26.320
establishing itself once
and for all in Tel-Aviv.

00:16:26.320 --> 00:16:30.420
Yet the end of Omanut's odyssey
was also to prove something

00:16:30.420 --> 00:16:33.660
of a beginning for
Shoshana, whose contributions

00:16:33.660 --> 00:16:38.150
to Jewish education were
quickly recognized by the leaders

00:16:38.150 --> 00:16:40.570
of the emerging Jewish state.

00:16:40.570 --> 00:16:43.910
For years she played a key
role in the Tel-Aviv department

00:16:43.910 --> 00:16:49.320
of education, and in 1949 she
was elected to the first Knesset.

00:16:49.320 --> 00:16:54.090
That is the first parliament of a
new established state of Israel,

00:16:54.090 --> 00:16:57.540
sharing the committee of
education and culture.

00:16:57.540 --> 00:17:02.360 position:56%
That she did not become the minister
of education was due to the fact

00:17:02.360 --> 00:17:06.330
that religious designer's party
objected to having a woman serve

00:17:06.330 --> 00:17:10.990
as minister, and that
was her own party.

00:17:10.990 --> 00:17:15.800
But Shoshana seems to have accepted
that decision very graciously.

00:17:15.800 --> 00:17:18.660
Nevertheless, I think that
the incident finds an echo

00:17:18.660 --> 00:17:23.130
in a story written just a few
years later by Shai Agnon,

00:17:23.130 --> 00:17:25.790
the great Hebrew novelist
who was to go on

00:17:25.790 --> 00:17:30.490
and win the Nobel Prize
for Literature in 1967.

00:17:30.490 --> 00:17:32.440
The story was written
on the occasion

00:17:32.440 --> 00:17:35.060
of Shoshana's 50th birthday.

00:17:35.060 --> 00:17:39.910
And in such a moving tribute to
this remarkable woman that I would

00:17:39.910 --> 00:17:45.710
like Agnon's words to you know
in a very abridged translation.

00:17:45.710 --> 00:17:49.890
I always think its sacrilege
translating Agnon, but,

00:17:49.890 --> 00:17:51.930
here I am committing sacrilege

00:17:51.930 --> 00:17:54.640
so that I can bring you
this beautiful story.

00:17:54.640 --> 00:17:58.430
Once upon a time, there
was a woman who loved

00:17:58.430 --> 00:18:01.420
to study the words of
our ancient rabbis.

00:18:01.420 --> 00:18:02.970 position:56%
But when she would go into the house

00:18:02.970 --> 00:18:07.240
of study the young men
studying there mocked her.

00:18:07.240 --> 00:18:10.040
This is no place for
women, they would jeer.

00:18:10.040 --> 00:18:12.260
But still she came every day,

00:18:12.260 --> 00:18:16.230
chose a book from the
shelves and sat down to study.

00:18:16.230 --> 00:18:19.750
One day the young men decided
to play a trick on her.

00:18:19.750 --> 00:18:25.320
They got up a large book with empty
pages, wrote, The Wisdom of Women

00:18:25.320 --> 00:18:28.680
on the spine and on its
cover and then placed it

00:18:28.680 --> 00:18:32.340
on the shelf alongside
the other books.

00:18:32.340 --> 00:18:35.660
When Shoshana came the next
day she spied this new book

00:18:35.660 --> 00:18:38.020
on the shelf and her eyes lit up.

00:18:38.020 --> 00:18:39.770
"Finally," she said to herself,

00:18:39.770 --> 00:18:44.130
"finally a book honoring the
wisdom and knowledge of women."

00:18:44.130 --> 00:18:48.170
But when she opened the book
all she found were blank pages.

00:18:48.170 --> 00:18:51.700
She looked up and saw the
young men laughing at her

00:18:51.700 --> 00:18:55.580
and her eyes filled
with tears and she wept.

00:18:55.580 --> 00:18:59.740
When she got home her children
saw that she had been crying

00:18:59.740 --> 00:19:02.310
so they began crying too.

00:19:02.310 --> 00:19:06.290
She filled their hands with nuts
and sweets, but still they cried.

00:19:06.290 --> 00:19:09.180
So finally she said,
"Look, if you'll be good

00:19:09.180 --> 00:19:11.700
and stop crying I'll
tell you a story."

00:19:11.700 --> 00:19:14.710
So they dry their eyes
and listened to the story

00:19:14.710 --> 00:19:16.010
and forgot their sorrows.

00:19:16.010 --> 00:19:20.760
And because she loved her children
she wrote these stories down,

00:19:20.760 --> 00:19:25.300 position:56%
taking care to use the finest paper,
and the most beautiful black ink,

00:19:25.300 --> 00:19:28.700
and a flowing hand that was careful
of the grammar and the spelling.

00:19:28.700 --> 00:19:33.520
And when the children saw how
beautiful the books were inside

00:19:33.520 --> 00:19:36.840
and out their hearts
longed for these books

00:19:36.840 --> 00:19:39.400 position:56%
and immediately wanted to read them.

00:19:39.400 --> 00:19:42.000
She therefore made many such books,

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:45.710
so many that their titles alone
would fill up the blank pages

00:19:45.710 --> 00:19:50.090
of that Wisdom of Women book
back in the house of the study.

00:19:50.090 --> 00:19:53.830
And when the young people grew
up they praised this woman

00:19:53.830 --> 00:19:57.190
for all she had taught them
and applied to her the verse

00:19:57.190 --> 00:20:01.380
from Proverbs saying, "Many
women have done excellently

00:20:01.380 --> 00:20:03.940
but you have succeeded them all."

00:20:03.940 --> 00:20:08.380
By the time Omanut
Press closed its doors

00:20:08.380 --> 00:20:13.530
in 1945 its books had
become a staple of education

00:20:13.530 --> 00:20:17.510
for several generations of
Israeli youth, introducing them

00:20:17.510 --> 00:20:20.860
to such world class
authors as Victor Hugo,

00:20:20.860 --> 00:20:22.890
Jules Verne, Charles Dickens.

00:20:22.890 --> 00:20:26.700
I can attest to this
from personal experience.

00:20:26.700 --> 00:20:29.780
Just a few weeks ago two
Israeli generals came

00:20:29.780 --> 00:20:34.000
to visit our reading room, and when
they asked me what I was working

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:36.930
on at present I mentioned
this program

00:20:36.930 --> 00:20:40.810
for children's books
and Omanut Press.

00:20:40.810 --> 00:20:43.800
Neither of them was familiar
with the name Omanut Press

00:20:43.800 --> 00:20:46.510
but when I mentioned
their translations,

00:20:46.510 --> 00:20:48.940
the Hebrew version Robinson Crusoe

00:20:48.940 --> 00:20:53.210
and Jules Verne's Captain
Hatteras their eyes lit up.

00:20:53.210 --> 00:20:56.720
They had grown up on those books
and they started comparing notes

00:20:56.720 --> 00:20:59.800
about their favorite childhood
heroes right then and there.

00:20:59.800 --> 00:21:04.350
They were not familiar however
with the exquisite picture books

00:21:04.350 --> 00:21:07.770
with which my own odyssey
into the remarkable career

00:21:07.770 --> 00:21:10.250
of Shoshana Persitz began.

00:21:10.250 --> 00:21:12.550
And indeed that's not surprising,

00:21:12.550 --> 00:21:17.080
these beautiful picture books were
apparently never reissued in Israel

00:21:17.080 --> 00:21:19.480
and they remain almost
completely unknown,

00:21:19.480 --> 00:21:22.310
even to dedicated bibliophiles.

00:21:23.500 --> 00:21:27.930
I would like to give the audience a
taste of this wonderful literature

00:21:27.930 --> 00:21:29.680
that we've been talking about.

00:21:29.680 --> 00:21:32.760
So today we're going to have
a dramatic reading of one

00:21:32.760 --> 00:21:35.650
of Chaim Nachman Bialik's poems.

00:21:35.650 --> 00:21:40.500
It's a translation from the
Russian Tom Thumb into Hebrew.

00:21:40.500 --> 00:21:44.310
It's a classic in Israeli
children's literature still today,

00:21:44.310 --> 00:21:45.610
it's a beautiful work.

00:21:45.610 --> 00:21:50.310
And it was first printed
in a children's magazine

00:21:50.310 --> 00:21:53.850
that was printed in Warsaw in 1911.

00:21:53.850 --> 00:21:58.150
I'd like to show you the cover
because it's absolutely exquisite.

00:21:58.150 --> 00:21:59.820
Isn't that incredible?

00:21:59.820 --> 00:22:04.590
I mean there was nothing like
it until the time, Warsaw 1911.

00:22:04.590 --> 00:22:08.410
It only came out for seven
months and it's extremely rare.

00:22:08.410 --> 00:22:12.800 position:56%
And most places that you do find it
in the world in the great libraries,

00:22:12.800 --> 00:22:18.010
say the National Library of Israel
or the Saint Petersburg Library

00:22:18.010 --> 00:22:21.350
in Russia, it's missing
this beautiful cover.

00:22:21.350 --> 00:22:23.730
Because it was so beautiful
people just ripped it off

00:22:23.730 --> 00:22:25.280
and kept it for themselves.

00:22:25.280 --> 00:22:28.790
So you open it up and all you have
is this black and white cover.

00:22:28.790 --> 00:22:30.850
But the Library of Congress,

00:22:30.850 --> 00:22:34.160 position:56%
with its wonderful collection is
fortunate in having all seven months

00:22:34.160 --> 00:22:37.800
of these issues with
the beautiful cover.

00:22:37.800 --> 00:22:40.960
So Bialik published
this Hebrew Version

00:22:40.960 --> 00:22:45.500
of the Tom Thumb inside
this beautiful periodical,

00:22:45.500 --> 00:22:47.930
Shachar Had which means The Dawn.

00:22:47.930 --> 00:22:50.700
And here is a picture
on the right hand side,

00:22:50.700 --> 00:22:53.610
and you see a little
photograph of Bialik himself,

00:22:53.610 --> 00:22:56.140
and then the Hebrew
version of Tom Thumb.

00:22:56.140 --> 00:22:58.660
So I've made a translation
in English,

00:22:58.660 --> 00:23:01.730
which I hope captures the rhyme
scheme and something of the --

00:23:01.730 --> 00:23:05.420
I hope it captures something of
the playful spirit of original.

00:23:05.420 --> 00:23:08.700
The image that you see here
comes from the second edition

00:23:08.700 --> 00:23:14.920
of <i>Tom Thumb </i>, which was published
by Omanut Press itself in 1923.

00:23:14.920 --> 00:23:17.530
And I will be taking
the part of Tom Thumb,

00:23:17.530 --> 00:23:20.290
I'm the one riding the
grasshopper outside the window.

00:23:20.290 --> 00:23:25.260
And my colleague, Abdulahi Ahmed,
is the eight-year-old child

00:23:25.260 --> 00:23:27.380
that you see jumping up
for joy in the picture.

00:23:27.380 --> 00:23:34.260
So without further ado, <i>Tom
Thumb </i>, by Chaim Nachman Bialik.

00:23:34.260 --> 00:23:36.110
&gt;&gt; Abdulahi Ahmed: Who are
knocking at my windows?

00:23:36.110 --> 00:23:42.880
Come -- why, it's a boy,
no bigger than my thumb.

00:23:42.880 --> 00:23:46.530
Tell me child, what's your name?

00:23:46.530 --> 00:23:49.410
The name of your parents
and whence you came?

00:23:49.410 --> 00:23:50.960
&gt;&gt; Ann Brener: I have no country.

00:23:50.960 --> 00:23:56.480
Nor yet a mother, father,
sister, aunt, nor brother.

00:23:56.480 --> 00:23:58.840
&gt;&gt; Abdulahi Ahmed: Where
do you mean to go my child?

00:23:58.840 --> 00:24:01.500
&gt;&gt; Ann Brener: To wander
through the forest, wild.

00:24:01.500 --> 00:24:03.570
&gt;&gt; Abdulahi Ahmed: Have you
a crust on which to feed?

00:24:03.570 --> 00:24:04.870
&gt;&gt; Ann Brener: Oh, for that?

00:24:04.870 --> 00:24:06.170
No need, no need.

00:24:06.170 --> 00:24:07.640
All the Earth is mine, is mine.

00:24:07.640 --> 00:24:10.770
I sip from flowers,
on dew drops dine.

00:24:10.770 --> 00:24:15.590
On a beetle's back I ride the land,
a cobweb form I reign in hand.

00:24:15.590 --> 00:24:20.660
Golden bees, embroidered fleas
bring me mana whenever I please.

00:24:20.660 --> 00:24:26.200
And from my glory a butterfly sews
a many colored suit of clothes.

00:24:26.200 --> 00:24:27.690
&gt;&gt; Abdulahi Ahmed:
But when it's dark

00:24:27.690 --> 00:24:32.570
and the snow lies deep how
will you lay down to sleep?

00:24:32.570 --> 00:24:34.790
&gt;&gt; Ann Brener: I mushroom's
cap will keep me warm.

00:24:34.790 --> 00:24:37.360
Under its roots I will
be safe from harm.

00:24:37.360 --> 00:24:41.970
An acorn shell all snug and tight
will be my bed to sleep at night.

00:24:41.970 --> 00:24:47.470
Folded hands to pillow my head, a
soft green leaf to cover my bed.

00:24:47.470 --> 00:24:52.380
And to keep me safe all night
a firefly will shine its light.

00:24:52.380 --> 00:24:54.910
&gt;&gt; Abdulahi Ahmed: When
morning comes how will you wake?

00:24:54.910 --> 00:24:57.850
&gt;&gt; Ann Brener: Why, when the
dawn just starts to break.

00:24:57.850 --> 00:25:01.520
With the kiss of the sun's
golden ray I'll open my eyes

00:25:01.520 --> 00:25:02.970
and start the day.

00:25:02.970 --> 00:25:05.940
I'll get up and wash and
start to chase the bees

00:25:05.940 --> 00:25:08.050
and the fleas all over the place.

00:25:08.050 --> 00:25:12.880
I'll peer into every hole I see,
nothing can be kept from me.

00:25:12.880 --> 00:25:16.300
&gt;&gt; Abdulahi Ahmed: Come
in my lad and sit with me,

00:25:16.300 --> 00:25:20.150
we will have some cake
and a spot of tea.

00:25:20.150 --> 00:25:21.450
&gt;&gt; Ann Brener: Oh no, no.

00:25:21.450 --> 00:25:22.750
I can't, my child.

00:25:22.750 --> 00:25:24.430
I must go flit around a while.

00:25:24.430 --> 00:25:26.870
We'll meet tomorrow,
since you entreat.

00:25:26.870 --> 00:25:29.050
Make sure there's something
good to eat.

00:25:29.050 --> 00:25:32.000
So shalom for now,
I have much to do.

00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:33.630
Shalom, shalom.

00:25:33.630 --> 00:25:34.930
Peace unto you.

00:25:34.930 --> 00:25:36.890
&gt;&gt; Abdulahi Ahmed: Shalom, shalom.

00:25:36.890 --> 00:25:38.190
Peace unto you.

00:25:38.190 --> 00:25:39.490
&gt;&gt; Ann Brener: Thank you.

00:25:39.490 --> 00:25:42.650
&gt;&gt; This has been a presentation
of the Library of Congress.
