MALE SPEAKER: Good afternoon.

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:13.310
Welcome to Musicians at Google
in Cambridge, Massachusetts.

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:18.150
Please silence all cellphones,
real cutlery, anything

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:21.210
that could make any noise.

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:25.560
Thanks to David Flores, we
have a remarkable event today.

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:29.930
I am here to introduce Brad
from Thinksay Records, who

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:34.680
are releasing David Duchovny's
solo-- not solo album,

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:36.640
it's recorded with a band.

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:37.140
Sorry.

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:38.420
First mistake already.

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:39.700
He's chuckling.

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:43.770
David Duchovny's new
album, "Hell or Highwater."

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:47.100
We are the second audience
who will be hearing anything

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:48.400
from this album.

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:51.040
He's going to be playing
more from it tonight

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:55.230
at Berkeley School of Music,
but they have to wait for us.

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:58.560
So without further ado, let me
introduce Brad from Thinksay

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:01.180
who's going to say some more.

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:03.160
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:09.580
BRAD: So I'm Brad
from Thinksay Records.

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:13.610
We are located right here
in Boston, Massachusetts.

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:17.490
And we are here today to
introduce David Duchovny.

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:20.790
We want to thank him for
coming out here today--

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:23.965
that'll be good,
thanks-- giving his time.

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:30.440
We're a small
independent record label

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:33.970
and we put out maybe like
one to three records a year.

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:36.600
And through a mutual
friend over a year

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:41.480
ago I was introduced to
David and he played me

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:43.630
some of the songs that he wrote.

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:45.590
And I really loved them.

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:47.470
I thought the melodies
were really cool,

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:51.551
and I thought lyrically
they were just like, wow.

00:01:51.551 --> 00:01:52.550
You could be a musician.

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:57.790
And then we just
started talking,

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:00.410
and we kind of vibed over
the same sort of stuff.

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:04.990
And it became a
real project for me.

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:06.790
The journey of
making this record

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:10.050
was something when I
was in summer camp,

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:13.890
and with Dave Flores, who
I was at summer camp with.

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:17.590
And we would just listen to
records over and over again.

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:20.150
And you'd be like,
oh, some day we're

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:21.870
going to be in the
studio, and we're

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:24.430
going to be making records.

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:28.130
And that never, ever
happens, until, you know,

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:30.080
I worked at Sony
Music for 20 years

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:31.840
and I worked with
everybody from Beyonce

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:33.550
to Johnny Cash to John Mayer.

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:37.100
And it never happened until
this project came along

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:40.700
that was just so niche and so
cool and so left of center.

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:44.185
And I just entered on a
real journey with David

00:02:44.185 --> 00:02:46.900
and with everybody at
Thinksay and everybody

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:49.340
on his team to make this record.

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:52.640
And it just became that
project that you dream about.

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:57.010
That was something I 100% did
for the journey and the ride.

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:00.604
And the business end,
we'll make some money.

00:03:00.604 --> 00:03:01.520
We'll lose some money.

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:04.180
We don't know exactly what's
going to happen there--

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:06.860
hopefully make some money.

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:09.350
But if not, we'll be
sleeping on David's couch.

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:12.060
And you know, it's still
nicer than my house.

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:17.570
The point is, it's one
of those dream projects.

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:20.195
It's like, if there's something
you're passionate about-- I was

00:03:20.195 --> 00:03:22.880
passionate about R.E.M. and
The Smiths and Lou Reed and Bob

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:23.380
Dylan.

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:25.790
And for me, those are my heroes.

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:29.030
And then when you see reviews in
"Rolling Stone" about the album

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:33.330
that's coming out and it says,
sounds like The Cure and R.E.M.

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:35.800
and Lou Reed and Bob Dylan,
and you're like, wow,

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:36.860
this is trippy.

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:40.260
So kind of like the guy
probably that started Google,

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:42.390
but he made like
a ton more money.

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:44.910
He had an idea, and that
really panned out well

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:45.810
for a lot of people.

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:50.686
So anyways, I want
to introduce David.

00:03:50.686 --> 00:03:51.810
We're going to play a song.

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:53.726
We're going to play four
tracks off the record

00:03:53.726 --> 00:03:56.470
and then in between, I'm going
to ask a couple questions,

00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:58.261
and we're going to hand
it over to you guys

00:03:58.261 --> 00:04:01.820
to ask questions to David about
what's going on in his life

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:03.060
and in his career.

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:07.900
So I just want to thank
quickly the people that

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:08.820
really helped do this.

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:13.630
David Flores, Kathleen, Carrie
Lee, the band, of course.

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:16.532
But me and my friend
were sitting on the couch

00:04:16.532 --> 00:04:17.990
one day watching
"Californication."

00:04:17.990 --> 00:04:20.299
I was like, you work at Google.

00:04:20.299 --> 00:04:21.549
Maybe I'll come by with David.

00:04:21.549 --> 00:04:22.450
Do you think people
would be interested?

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:23.658
And he's like, oh definitely.

00:04:23.658 --> 00:04:24.450
I'm like, OK, cool.

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:25.760
So now we're here.

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:28.350
So that's how it happened.

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:30.570
But without further
ado, the people

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:32.420
you really want
to see, the band.

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:36.054
Colin Lee, Pat McCusker,
and David Duchovny.

00:04:36.054 --> 00:04:37.042
[APPLAUSE]

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:48.320
DAVID DUCHOVNY: Hi.

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:51.254
I have this USB thing
that goes in the--

00:04:51.254 --> 00:04:55.520
[LAUGHTER]

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:57.890
Yeah.

00:04:57.890 --> 00:05:02.140
So these are the stripped down
versions of songs on the album.

00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:05.350
I guess we call them acoustic,
but we seem to be amplified.

00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:06.810
So it's kind of an in between.

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:11.400
But what are we going
to start with? "3000"?

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:13.620
It has some New York
geography-- I apologize

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:15.701
for that-- in this song.

00:05:15.701 --> 00:05:19.660
There's a lot of Central
Park imagery, so forgive me.

00:05:24.151 --> 00:05:26.646
[MUSIC - DAVID DUCHOVNY, "3000"]

00:09:02.178 --> 00:09:04.146
[APPLAUSE]

00:09:12.715 --> 00:09:13.840
BRAD: So, it sounded great.

00:09:13.840 --> 00:09:16.424
It's the second time you've ever
performed in front of people.

00:09:16.424 --> 00:09:18.006
DAVID DUCHOVNY:
That's the happy song.

00:09:18.006 --> 00:09:18.626
BRAD: Yeah.

00:09:18.626 --> 00:09:21.940
[LAUGHTER]

00:09:21.940 --> 00:09:25.930
So it's been definitely
a busy year for you,

00:09:25.930 --> 00:09:29.575
and being part of making
this record was interesting

00:09:29.575 --> 00:09:33.789
because it was the first time
I made an album with-- I don't

00:09:33.789 --> 00:09:35.080
want to say someone like David.

00:09:35.080 --> 00:09:37.590
He's sort of a
unique guy in is own,

00:09:37.590 --> 00:09:40.630
but somebody that's had massive
success on the Hollywood side.

00:09:40.630 --> 00:09:42.495
DAVID DUCHOVNY:
Where'd my band go?

00:09:42.495 --> 00:09:42.780
BRAD: They're done.

00:09:42.780 --> 00:09:43.140
They left.

00:09:43.140 --> 00:09:44.190
DAVID DUCHOVNY: What the hell?

00:09:44.190 --> 00:09:44.720
BRAD: One song.

00:09:44.720 --> 00:09:45.510
DAVID DUCHOVNY: Stay out here.

00:09:45.510 --> 00:09:46.759
We're going to sing some more.

00:09:46.759 --> 00:09:47.560
BRAD: Yeah, Yeah.

00:09:47.560 --> 00:09:47.890
DAVID DUCHOVNY: Yeah.

00:09:47.890 --> 00:09:49.390
BRAD: We have
questions for you too.

00:09:53.820 --> 00:09:57.920
So trying to just schedule
and make this all happen

00:09:57.920 --> 00:10:01.300
was a little bit longer than
making a traditional record.

00:10:01.300 --> 00:10:05.690
But David decided to write a
book in between it all and then

00:10:05.690 --> 00:10:09.330
was coming off filming a new
show for NBC called "Aquarius,"

00:10:09.330 --> 00:10:14.417
which we'll talk about in a
bit, and "X-Files" coming back,

00:10:14.417 --> 00:10:15.250
filming this summer.

00:10:15.250 --> 00:10:18.790
So a lot of stuff going on.

00:10:18.790 --> 00:10:20.180
And we'll get to that too.

00:10:20.180 --> 00:10:26.530
So in terms of writing an
album, it's a very real record.

00:10:26.530 --> 00:10:28.620
Can you talk a little
bit about the process

00:10:28.620 --> 00:10:30.900
of actually making the music?

00:10:30.900 --> 00:10:32.470
Like, how these
songs came to you.

00:10:32.470 --> 00:10:36.020
Is this a collection of
thoughts over years of time?

00:10:36.020 --> 00:10:37.290
Is it a certain period?

00:10:37.290 --> 00:10:40.270
And just taking the jump from
the Hollywood side to say I'm

00:10:40.270 --> 00:10:42.250
going to really write songs.

00:10:42.250 --> 00:10:45.520
DAVID DUCHOVNY:
Well, it's a-- yeah,

00:10:45.520 --> 00:10:46.980
I guess it's a certain period.

00:10:46.980 --> 00:10:51.940
All the songs have a certain
kind of flavor to them,

00:10:51.940 --> 00:10:53.200
I think.

00:10:53.200 --> 00:10:56.560
It's like a snapshot
of a certain time.

00:10:56.560 --> 00:11:02.650
But I think I just
never had an idea

00:11:02.650 --> 00:11:07.640
that I would make an album.

00:11:07.640 --> 00:11:11.000
I have a phone that
records things on it.

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:13.510
You guys might have heard of it.

00:11:13.510 --> 00:11:16.380
OK, I won't do jokes
like that so much.

00:11:16.380 --> 00:11:19.212
I thought they'd go over
better, but they're not

00:11:19.212 --> 00:11:20.170
going over well at all.

00:11:20.170 --> 00:11:23.030
Anyway, so I have
Garage Band on my phone.

00:11:23.030 --> 00:11:25.150
And I just use it
as a tape recorder

00:11:25.150 --> 00:11:27.730
because I can't even figure out
how to do multi-tracks on it.

00:11:27.730 --> 00:11:31.470
And I only play one instrument,
so it doesn't matter.

00:11:31.470 --> 00:11:34.800
So I would just sit there,
and after I figured out

00:11:34.800 --> 00:11:36.630
that there are only so
many chords that you

00:11:36.630 --> 00:11:39.400
can play on guitar,
and in rock and roll

00:11:39.400 --> 00:11:40.650
there are only so many chords.

00:11:40.650 --> 00:11:43.108
And these songs that I like,
there are only so many chords.

00:11:43.108 --> 00:11:45.180
And at some point I
knew most of them.

00:11:45.180 --> 00:11:48.590
So I thought, well, maybe if
I can come up with a melody,

00:11:48.590 --> 00:11:49.610
I can write a song.

00:11:49.610 --> 00:11:50.960
So I started doing that.

00:11:50.960 --> 00:11:53.770
The words for me
were always first

00:11:53.770 --> 00:11:57.690
and always, I don't want
to say easy, but easier.

00:11:57.690 --> 00:12:00.360
And so then I just starting
putting words on the melodies

00:12:00.360 --> 00:12:01.650
and put them on my phone.

00:12:01.650 --> 00:12:03.240
And I thought, oh, I've
written some songs that

00:12:03.240 --> 00:12:03.906
are on my phone.

00:12:03.906 --> 00:12:07.780
I hope nobody finds my phone.

00:12:07.780 --> 00:12:11.250
And then through Keaton
Simons I met Brad.

00:12:11.250 --> 00:12:15.490
And Brad really kept
pushing me to get better,

00:12:15.490 --> 00:12:19.820
and you know, just to
get better and to get

00:12:19.820 --> 00:12:24.239
more serious about recording,
and hooked me up with Colin

00:12:24.239 --> 00:12:25.280
and the rest of the guys.

00:12:25.280 --> 00:12:28.310
And we made it into an album.

00:12:28.310 --> 00:12:30.020
I love the sound of it.

00:12:30.020 --> 00:12:34.140
I can't believe
that I'm part of it.

00:12:34.140 --> 00:12:36.750
It's the weirdest feeling.

00:12:36.750 --> 00:12:38.090
I'm not sure it's real.

00:12:38.090 --> 00:12:41.540
But he showed me
the physical box.

00:12:41.540 --> 00:12:42.764
You got the box?

00:12:42.764 --> 00:12:44.430
BRAD: Carrie, do we
have that somewhere?

00:12:44.430 --> 00:12:45.080
[LAUGHTER]

00:12:45.080 --> 00:12:46.538
DAVID DUCHOVNY:
Today, this morning

00:12:46.538 --> 00:12:49.230
was the first time I saw it
and I was like, give me that.

00:12:49.230 --> 00:12:51.625
BRAD: It's probably in my bag.

00:12:51.625 --> 00:12:53.500
DAVID DUCHOVNY: I didn't
answer any question,

00:12:53.500 --> 00:12:54.635
but I said some things.

00:12:54.635 --> 00:12:55.135
BRAD: Yeah.

00:12:57.580 --> 00:13:00.180
Well, I think one of the
things that stood out

00:13:00.180 --> 00:13:03.530
to me most in this project is--

00:13:03.530 --> 00:13:05.169
DAVID DUCHOVNY: Why
isn't it in my bag?

00:13:05.169 --> 00:13:06.085
Why is it in that bag?

00:13:06.085 --> 00:13:07.540
It should be in my bag.

00:13:07.540 --> 00:13:09.906
BRAD: That's only the proof.

00:13:09.906 --> 00:13:12.684
It's not even out yet.

00:13:12.684 --> 00:13:14.100
I think it's in
the middle pocket.

00:13:14.100 --> 00:13:16.433
DAVID DUCHOVNY: For instance,
"Hell or Highwater," which

00:13:16.433 --> 00:13:19.950
is the single, Brad loves that
song, and he would not stop.

00:13:19.950 --> 00:13:23.196
He's just such a
pain in the ass.

00:13:23.196 --> 00:13:25.600
You know, I only have my voice.

00:13:25.600 --> 00:13:28.790
You know, it's a
small instrument.

00:13:28.790 --> 00:13:34.090
And Brad was like, sing
better, sing better.

00:13:34.090 --> 00:13:34.710
And I hated--

00:13:34.710 --> 00:13:37.020
BRAD: Not exactly like that.

00:13:37.020 --> 00:13:39.842
DAVID DUCHOVNY: No,
he's very encouraging.

00:13:39.842 --> 00:13:40.670
No.

00:13:40.670 --> 00:13:43.160
That didn't sound-- I sounded
like I was being ironic.

00:13:43.160 --> 00:13:45.750
But he's actually
a total enthusiast

00:13:45.750 --> 00:13:48.430
and makes a lot
of stuff possible.

00:13:48.430 --> 00:13:50.990
He's one of those guys that
tells you it can be done,

00:13:50.990 --> 00:13:52.620
which is rare.

00:13:52.620 --> 00:13:53.910
Most people tell you it can't.

00:13:56.700 --> 00:14:01.330
But even so, he was a real pain
in the ass about that song.

00:14:01.330 --> 00:14:04.310
And we finally got
it last winter.

00:14:04.310 --> 00:14:07.277
Look at that thing.

00:14:07.277 --> 00:14:08.860
BRAD: Tell them about
the album cover.

00:14:08.860 --> 00:14:10.235
DAVID DUCHOVNY:
It's upside down.

00:14:10.235 --> 00:14:11.412
[APPLAUSE]

00:14:15.160 --> 00:14:16.230
Anyway, so more--

00:14:16.230 --> 00:14:19.240
BRAD: Tell them about
the album cover.

00:14:19.240 --> 00:14:21.115
DAVID DUCHOVNY: There's
a camera on my phone.

00:14:23.790 --> 00:14:25.270
And I took that picture.

00:14:25.270 --> 00:14:28.520
I was down vacationing
with my kids

00:14:28.520 --> 00:14:30.999
and it's just a reflection.

00:14:30.999 --> 00:14:32.290
I was taking a picture of them.

00:14:32.290 --> 00:14:33.081
You can't see them.

00:14:33.081 --> 00:14:35.190
They're in the room,
and you only see me.

00:14:35.190 --> 00:14:37.250
But it's not important.

00:14:37.250 --> 00:14:39.880
[LAUGHTER]

00:14:39.880 --> 00:14:42.140
BRAD: I think the import
part of the picture

00:14:42.140 --> 00:14:44.940
of that is we would often
practice in David's living

00:14:44.940 --> 00:14:45.540
room.

00:14:45.540 --> 00:14:47.165
And then through the
months and months,

00:14:47.165 --> 00:14:48.740
you're thinking
about art and how

00:14:48.740 --> 00:14:50.810
you want to market the
record, and et cetera.

00:14:50.810 --> 00:14:53.059
And I always love kind of
the black and white imagery,

00:14:53.059 --> 00:14:53.960
we all kind of did.

00:14:53.960 --> 00:14:56.435
And then coming up with the
album cover took forever,

00:14:56.435 --> 00:14:58.560
and finally we were like,
wait, this picture that's

00:14:58.560 --> 00:15:00.610
been hanging above us while
we've been making this album,

00:15:00.610 --> 00:15:01.560
let's just use that.

00:15:01.560 --> 00:15:02.930
And that's how it came together.

00:15:02.930 --> 00:15:05.054
DAVID DUCHOVNY: And it was
cheap because I took it.

00:15:05.054 --> 00:15:06.250
BRAD: And it was cheap.

00:15:06.250 --> 00:15:08.080
Yeah, exactly.

00:15:08.080 --> 00:15:10.245
OK, let's hear another song.

00:15:16.601 --> 00:15:18.476
DAVID DUCHOVNY: This is
called "Let it Rain."

00:15:18.476 --> 00:15:20.408
There's a lot of
rain on the album.

00:15:20.408 --> 00:15:23.789
[MUSIC DAVID DUCHOVNY, "LET IT
 RAIN"]

00:20:04.563 --> 00:20:06.551
[APPLAUSE]

00:20:13.020 --> 00:20:14.400
BRAD: That sounds great.

00:20:14.400 --> 00:20:16.880
Like David said, I'm
a bit of a miser when

00:20:16.880 --> 00:20:20.170
it comes to the sound, so
when it sounds perfect,

00:20:20.170 --> 00:20:23.587
I'm that one weird guy that's
like, no, one more time.

00:20:23.587 --> 00:20:25.670
And then that's like six
hours later, you're like,

00:20:25.670 --> 00:20:26.284
OK, we got it.

00:20:26.284 --> 00:20:28.450
DAVID DUCHOVNY: You want
me to sing it again, right?

00:20:28.450 --> 00:20:30.080
BRAD: Yeah, exactly.

00:20:30.080 --> 00:20:33.090
But I remember we were in the
studio and starting, and Colin

00:20:33.090 --> 00:20:37.670
Lee here, who is the
producer of the record, Colin

00:20:37.670 --> 00:20:40.770
and I met through
one of the girls who

00:20:40.770 --> 00:20:43.650
works with me, Carrie.

00:20:43.650 --> 00:20:45.250
That's Carrie's brother.

00:20:45.250 --> 00:20:49.340
And he's been a musician in
his own band called Weather.

00:20:49.340 --> 00:20:51.900
And I really thought he'd
be a great match with David

00:20:51.900 --> 00:20:53.730
to help bring out the ideas.

00:20:53.730 --> 00:20:56.310
And I remember it was like
the first day in the studio,

00:20:56.310 --> 00:20:59.350
and it was like the first
line of the first song.

00:20:59.350 --> 00:21:01.330
We're like, OK, take one.

00:21:01.330 --> 00:21:04.040
And then it was like 100
versions of the line,

00:21:04.040 --> 00:21:05.890
and then Colin
came in the studio

00:21:05.890 --> 00:21:08.170
and David couldn't
hear us, so he

00:21:08.170 --> 00:21:10.677
was just seeing like me, Carrie,
and Colin, like-- you know?

00:21:10.677 --> 00:21:12.760
And then he was like, is
everything cool in there?

00:21:12.760 --> 00:21:13.520
We're like, yeah.

00:21:13.520 --> 00:21:14.450
We're just listening to an edit.

00:21:14.450 --> 00:21:14.950
Yeah.

00:21:14.950 --> 00:21:15.830
Everything's cool.

00:21:15.830 --> 00:21:18.500
And then Colin was like, we're
going to be here all day.

00:21:18.500 --> 00:21:19.710
Do you know how long
this is going to take?

00:21:19.710 --> 00:21:20.880
Do you know how long
this is going to take?

00:21:20.880 --> 00:21:21.950
Santa's not going to be happy.

00:21:21.950 --> 00:21:22.870
The toys have got to get out.

00:21:22.870 --> 00:21:24.245
DAVID DUCHOVNY:
I don't know if I

00:21:24.245 --> 00:21:26.560
should be here for this story.

00:21:26.560 --> 00:21:27.920
It's the first I've heard of it.

00:21:27.920 --> 00:21:29.180
BRAD: Yeah, well, now you--

00:21:29.180 --> 00:21:29.720
DAVID DUCHOVNY: I
will show you what

00:21:29.720 --> 00:21:31.719
I looked like at the end
of four hours of trying

00:21:31.719 --> 00:21:33.737
to sing one song.

00:21:33.737 --> 00:21:34.320
BRAD: Exactly.

00:21:37.760 --> 00:21:40.350
So the first day
was a little rough,

00:21:40.350 --> 00:21:42.670
as you see the way
David wound up,

00:21:42.670 --> 00:21:46.270
because this is a new process
for all of us doing this.

00:21:46.270 --> 00:21:48.730
And it was interesting because
the first day, I think,

00:21:48.730 --> 00:21:50.269
we got through not as much.

00:21:50.269 --> 00:21:51.310
DAVID DUCHOVNY: One song.

00:21:51.310 --> 00:21:51.600
One song.

00:21:51.600 --> 00:21:52.475
BRAD: Yeah, one song.

00:21:52.475 --> 00:21:54.930
But then the next day
within the morning alone,

00:21:54.930 --> 00:21:57.630
we did like three
songs in three hours.

00:21:57.630 --> 00:22:02.230
So David really put in a lot of
time and work into the music,

00:22:02.230 --> 00:22:03.080
into the vocals.

00:22:03.080 --> 00:22:05.310
And to hear it even now,
like the second time

00:22:05.310 --> 00:22:08.110
you're playing it,
it's really amazing.

00:22:08.110 --> 00:22:09.387
It's a job well done.

00:22:09.387 --> 00:22:10.470
DAVID DUCHOVNY: Thank you.

00:22:10.470 --> 00:22:13.910
BRAD: One thing I wanted to ask
that I think was special to me

00:22:13.910 --> 00:22:16.600
through the project and I
always try to teach the younger

00:22:16.600 --> 00:22:20.380
kids that are now working for
my company is taking shots

00:22:20.380 --> 00:22:20.970
in life.

00:22:20.970 --> 00:22:23.720
My philosophy is,
take shots, pay bills.

00:22:23.720 --> 00:22:26.940
So if you can pay your bills
and take shots, you're good.

00:22:26.940 --> 00:22:29.540
And that's what I do in my life.

00:22:29.540 --> 00:22:32.130
But David, for
somebody who's had

00:22:32.130 --> 00:22:36.260
a lot of success in two
different Golden Globe

00:22:36.260 --> 00:22:38.970
performances for two
different major characters,

00:22:38.970 --> 00:22:40.750
this year you really
did venture out.

00:22:40.750 --> 00:22:43.780
You wrote your first book
called "Holy Cow," which

00:22:43.780 --> 00:22:46.330
was recently out and a "New
York Times" best seller,

00:22:46.330 --> 00:22:47.290
and this album.

00:22:47.290 --> 00:22:48.915
I thought maybe you'd
talk a little bit

00:22:48.915 --> 00:22:51.070
about taking shots
and trying new things

00:22:51.070 --> 00:22:54.069
at this point in your career.

00:22:54.069 --> 00:22:54.860
DAVID DUCHOVNY: Oh.

00:22:58.710 --> 00:23:01.770
I think that when
I talk to my kids,

00:23:01.770 --> 00:23:04.170
I always talk to
them about failing.

00:23:04.170 --> 00:23:09.270
And And I was lying
in bed this morning,

00:23:09.270 --> 00:23:11.400
I was trying to come
up with a pithy thing.

00:23:11.400 --> 00:23:13.510
And I'm going to
try it out on you.

00:23:13.510 --> 00:23:17.550
I'm going to try and make
it into "Bartlett's" today.

00:23:17.550 --> 00:23:21.440
So success is a lecturer.

00:23:21.440 --> 00:23:24.470
Failure is a teacher.

00:23:24.470 --> 00:23:25.628
Anybody?

00:23:25.628 --> 00:23:26.128
Not bad?

00:23:26.128 --> 00:23:27.260
[APPLAUSE]

00:23:27.260 --> 00:23:29.150
"Barlett's"?

00:23:29.150 --> 00:23:32.440
I don't like the word
lecturer, it's clunky.

00:23:32.440 --> 00:23:35.125
But anyway, that's
the way I feel.

00:23:35.125 --> 00:23:38.920
It's like, you don't
really learn from success.

00:23:38.920 --> 00:23:40.660
You learn maybe intellectually.

00:23:40.660 --> 00:23:45.710
But failure teaches you how
to be human being and an adult

00:23:45.710 --> 00:23:50.580
and a person and
empathetic and human.

00:23:50.580 --> 00:23:58.846
And so I always try to teach my
kids to be comfortable failing.

00:23:58.846 --> 00:24:00.470
Not comfortable,
that's the wrong word,

00:24:00.470 --> 00:24:02.420
but I think you
know what I mean.

00:24:02.420 --> 00:24:06.882
So in taking my shots, I
just feel like, well, all

00:24:06.882 --> 00:24:09.340
I can do is fail and that's
like the worst that can happen.

00:24:09.340 --> 00:24:09.850
So what?

00:24:09.850 --> 00:24:12.570
So then I can try
something else,

00:24:12.570 --> 00:24:14.470
or try it again, or whatever.

00:24:14.470 --> 00:24:19.460
And I'm lucky enough to
have had success in one area

00:24:19.460 --> 00:24:22.070
where the failure doesn't
seem as dire like if I were

00:24:22.070 --> 00:24:23.320
to fail doing other things.

00:24:23.320 --> 00:24:26.230
So I might be full
of shit because it's

00:24:26.230 --> 00:24:27.250
a bit of a safety net.

00:24:30.170 --> 00:24:33.130
In fact, I am full of shit.

00:24:35.770 --> 00:24:36.302
Anyway.

00:24:36.302 --> 00:24:38.760
BRAD: I mean, I think creatively
putting yourself out there

00:24:38.760 --> 00:24:41.300
in other arenas, there's
certainly a real risk factor.

00:24:41.300 --> 00:24:43.400
It might not be if
the book didn't--

00:24:43.400 --> 00:24:44.640
DAVID DUCHOVNY: People
are going to make fun.

00:24:44.640 --> 00:24:45.723
People make fun, whatever.

00:24:45.723 --> 00:24:46.816
BRAD: Haters gonna hate.

00:24:46.816 --> 00:24:48.295
[LAUGHTER]

00:24:48.295 --> 00:24:49.780
You know?

00:24:49.780 --> 00:24:50.772
DAVID DUCHOVNY: Hit it.

00:24:50.772 --> 00:24:52.887
[LAUGHTER]

00:24:52.887 --> 00:24:54.720
BRAD: I wanted to talk
about one more thing.

00:24:54.720 --> 00:24:55.790
We're going to go
to another song

00:24:55.790 --> 00:24:57.331
and then when we
come back, I'm going

00:24:57.331 --> 00:25:00.600
to hand it over to
questions from you guys.

00:25:00.600 --> 00:25:02.580
"Hell or Highwater"
is out May 12,

00:25:02.580 --> 00:25:06.620
and you can watch David perform
on the "Today Show" May 12,

00:25:06.620 --> 00:25:12.200
or "Live with Kelly"
on May 14, and tonight

00:25:12.200 --> 00:25:15.670
at the 939 Cafe in Boston,
which is at Berkeley.

00:25:15.670 --> 00:25:18.090
And all the members of the
band are Berkeley members,

00:25:18.090 --> 00:25:20.780
which is how we kind of put
this whole thing together.

00:25:20.780 --> 00:25:23.025
But after that, he
takes like, a day off

00:25:23.025 --> 00:25:27.500
and then your new show
"Aquarius" airs on NBC.

00:25:27.500 --> 00:25:29.510
Why don't you give
them a little bit

00:25:29.510 --> 00:25:30.760
of what the show is all about.

00:25:30.760 --> 00:25:33.210
It's May 28th, and
it's the first time,

00:25:33.210 --> 00:25:37.350
which I think is really
interesting, is "X-Files"

00:25:37.350 --> 00:25:41.320
is the longest running
sci-fi show in television.

00:25:41.320 --> 00:25:43.800
"Aquarius," which
NBC is releasing

00:25:43.800 --> 00:25:47.350
full streaming of the
entire first season,

00:25:47.350 --> 00:25:50.190
and this is the first time a
major network is doing that.

00:25:50.190 --> 00:25:53.630
I think it's kind of cool to be
in the history books both times

00:25:53.630 --> 00:25:54.220
there.

00:25:54.220 --> 00:25:56.030
But tell us a little
bit about the show.

00:25:58.527 --> 00:26:00.360
DAVID DUCHOVNY: Just
quickly, I'll tell you.

00:26:00.360 --> 00:26:03.850
I play a homicide
detective in 1967 in LA.

00:26:03.850 --> 00:26:06.350
And the love of my
life, who's gone off

00:26:06.350 --> 00:26:09.690
to marry a lawyer who is trying
to get Ronald Reagan elected

00:26:09.690 --> 00:26:12.330
governor at the
time, their daughter

00:26:12.330 --> 00:26:14.260
disappears, a
15-year-old girl who

00:26:14.260 --> 00:26:17.040
runs away with a
bunch of hippies

00:26:17.040 --> 00:26:18.540
to go live in the desert.

00:26:18.540 --> 00:26:23.470
And she's 15 years old, so
she wants her daughter back

00:26:23.470 --> 00:26:27.690
and doesn't want any
notoriety because her husband

00:26:27.690 --> 00:26:30.890
and the family is a
big right-wing power.

00:26:30.890 --> 00:26:34.410
So she calls me, her old
love, to go find her daughter,

00:26:34.410 --> 00:26:36.177
and I track her down.

00:26:36.177 --> 00:26:38.760
She's living in the desert with
a fellow named Charlie Manson.

00:26:38.760 --> 00:26:42.620
So that's the
beginning of the story.

00:26:42.620 --> 00:26:45.560
And that's two years before
the Tate, LaBianca murders,

00:26:45.560 --> 00:26:48.120
so he's just kind
of a conman pimp.

00:26:48.120 --> 00:26:50.290
You know, not a big deal.

00:26:50.290 --> 00:26:52.070
The name doesn't
ring anybody's bell.

00:26:52.070 --> 00:26:53.940
And that's how we start.

00:26:53.940 --> 00:26:54.590
BRAD: Cool.

00:26:54.590 --> 00:26:57.260
All right, let's
hear another song.

00:27:02.727 --> 00:27:06.206
[MUSIC DAVID DUCHOVNY, "WHEN THE
 TIME COMES"]

00:30:52.129 --> 00:30:53.091
[APPLAUSE]

00:30:57.910 --> 00:31:01.300
BRAD: So we're going to open up
some questions to the audience.

00:31:01.300 --> 00:31:03.784
Carrie back there
has the live mic,

00:31:03.784 --> 00:31:05.950
so if there's somebody that
has a question for David

00:31:05.950 --> 00:31:08.530
wants to raise their hand.

00:31:08.530 --> 00:31:14.520
And just to let you know,
David after "Aquarius"

00:31:14.520 --> 00:31:19.895
is going to be filming
this summer six episodes

00:31:19.895 --> 00:31:23.890
of "X-Files," which I'm
sure some of you know.

00:31:23.890 --> 00:31:27.882
And there's no script
yet that he has in hand.

00:31:27.882 --> 00:31:29.590
DAVID DUCHOVNY:
"X-Files" created Google.

00:31:29.590 --> 00:31:30.910
BRAD: What's that?

00:31:30.910 --> 00:31:32.640
[LAUGHTER]

00:31:32.640 --> 00:31:35.330
"X-Files" created Google.

00:31:35.330 --> 00:31:37.154
Everybody knows that.

00:31:37.154 --> 00:31:38.570
BRAD: That's what
he's doing next.

00:31:38.570 --> 00:31:43.470
You can tell, from book,
to show, to album, to show,

00:31:43.470 --> 00:31:45.820
it's pretty busy,
so it's exciting.

00:31:48.330 --> 00:31:49.810
You're a good guy.

00:31:49.810 --> 00:31:51.740
Just want to let them know.

00:31:51.740 --> 00:31:53.665
So we'll open it
up to the audience.

00:31:58.490 --> 00:31:59.311
AUDIENCE: Hello.

00:31:59.311 --> 00:32:01.310
BRAD: If you want to just
say what your name is.

00:32:01.310 --> 00:32:01.830
AUDIENCE: Sorry.

00:32:01.830 --> 00:32:02.830
My name's Anna Cosmus.

00:32:02.830 --> 00:32:03.621
DAVID DUCHOVNY: Hi.

00:32:03.621 --> 00:32:04.210
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:32:04.210 --> 00:32:06.630
I was thinking we can't have
a celebrity in the house

00:32:06.630 --> 00:32:08.490
without a famous group selfie.

00:32:08.490 --> 00:32:10.605
So are you ready?

00:32:10.605 --> 00:32:11.980
DAVID DUCHOVNY:
How do I do that?

00:32:11.980 --> 00:32:13.150
AUDIENCE: I'll come up there.

00:32:13.150 --> 00:32:15.140
BRAD: I think we're going
to do that at the end.

00:32:15.140 --> 00:32:15.580
Yeah.

00:32:15.580 --> 00:32:17.270
I think we're going to
do the group selfie.

00:32:17.270 --> 00:32:17.900
DAVID DUCHOVNY: A group selfie?

00:32:17.900 --> 00:32:18.566
You mean, like--

00:32:18.566 --> 00:32:21.340
BRAD: That's like where
you've got behind you--

00:32:21.340 --> 00:32:21.910
DAVID DUCHOVNY:
It's a Google thing.

00:32:21.910 --> 00:32:23.730
It's just like a technological
thing I don't get.

00:32:23.730 --> 00:32:24.520
BRAD: It's Google.

00:32:24.520 --> 00:32:25.810
AUDIENCE: Oh boy, OK.

00:32:25.810 --> 00:32:26.859
I'll ask a real question.

00:32:26.859 --> 00:32:28.900
DAVID DUCHOVNY: Somebody
said Twitter [INAUDIBLE]

00:32:28.900 --> 00:32:29.608
me the other day.

00:32:29.608 --> 00:32:30.480
And was like, nah.

00:32:30.480 --> 00:32:30.980
I'm done.

00:32:30.980 --> 00:32:32.682
[LAUGHTER]

00:32:32.682 --> 00:32:34.140
AUDIENCE: I'll ask
a real question.

00:32:34.140 --> 00:32:35.473
DAVID DUCHOVNY: Yeah, that's OK.

00:32:35.473 --> 00:32:38.467
AUDIENCE: Who was your
muse for this album?

00:32:38.467 --> 00:32:39.300
DAVID DUCHOVNY: God.

00:32:39.300 --> 00:32:39.870
I don't know.

00:32:39.870 --> 00:32:44.190
You I know, just getting
the music together,

00:32:44.190 --> 00:32:46.940
hearing the melodies, and then
just putting the words down.

00:32:46.940 --> 00:32:51.670
I mean, I like to think that the
songs just stand on their own

00:32:51.670 --> 00:32:54.340
and they-- I don't
really like songs

00:32:54.340 --> 00:32:58.060
to be explained to me unless
they don't make any sense.

00:32:58.060 --> 00:32:59.780
[LAUGHTER]

00:32:59.780 --> 00:33:02.870
Because I think songs
are really for the people

00:33:02.870 --> 00:33:03.990
that listen to them.

00:33:03.990 --> 00:33:07.110
The songs are not for
me at all anymore.

00:33:07.110 --> 00:33:10.500
So I would like to
shut up about the songs

00:33:10.500 --> 00:33:14.790
and let what was a muse, or
what was I thinking about,

00:33:14.790 --> 00:33:17.082
or what does that mean, you
know, let it mean something

00:33:17.082 --> 00:33:17.873
to you, if it does.

00:33:17.873 --> 00:33:19.200
And if it doesn't, I'm sorry.

00:33:19.200 --> 00:33:24.470
But you know, I think
songs are for others.

00:33:24.470 --> 00:33:26.014
I hope they are anyway.

00:33:26.014 --> 00:33:28.430
AUDIENCE: All right, thanks.

00:33:28.430 --> 00:33:31.430
BRAD: I can tell you I'm
up early, David's up early.

00:33:31.430 --> 00:33:33.490
So I have two dachshunds.

00:33:33.490 --> 00:33:36.680
One's name Tom Brady and
the other, Lord Fenway.

00:33:36.680 --> 00:33:42.950
So Lord Fenway is like the queen
of Queens, like, glorious fur

00:33:42.950 --> 00:33:45.050
and she thinks she's
like the mayor of Boston.

00:33:45.050 --> 00:33:46.900
And she doesn't
move for anybody.

00:33:46.900 --> 00:33:50.010
But any time I play
just David's music--

00:33:50.010 --> 00:33:52.594
and I would videotape it and
text it to him all the time.

00:33:52.594 --> 00:33:54.260
It was like just kind
of a running joke.

00:33:54.260 --> 00:33:56.884
You'd play it, she'd be sleeping
at the other end of the house,

00:33:56.884 --> 00:33:59.614
and she'd hear it,
walk over a little bit,

00:33:59.614 --> 00:34:01.780
and then just sit in front
of the speaker like that.

00:34:01.780 --> 00:34:04.270
So I mean, that's
the number one fan

00:34:04.270 --> 00:34:06.440
of the music from the beginning.

00:34:06.440 --> 00:34:07.070
Every morning.

00:34:07.070 --> 00:34:09.610
That's the muse, that
was the muse really.

00:34:09.610 --> 00:34:11.380
DAVID DUCHOVNY: I
have a whole set of--

00:34:11.380 --> 00:34:13.260
BRAD: Yeah, there's
probably 800 videos.

00:34:13.260 --> 00:34:14.676
DAVID DUCHOVNY:
Four-second videos

00:34:14.676 --> 00:34:16.952
of the dog just
turning a corner.

00:34:16.952 --> 00:34:18.940
[LAUGHTER]

00:34:18.940 --> 00:34:21.110
BRAD: So funny.

00:34:21.110 --> 00:34:24.449
OK, another question

00:34:24.449 --> 00:34:26.120
AUDIENCE: Hi, my name
is Pat Lopeselli.

00:34:26.120 --> 00:34:31.580
And my question is, coming from
another creative profession,

00:34:31.580 --> 00:34:34.310
the song writing and
album producing experience

00:34:34.310 --> 00:34:36.280
was new for you, as
far as craft goes.

00:34:36.280 --> 00:34:39.468
What was the funnest thing
about this new craft?

00:34:39.468 --> 00:34:41.634
And what was the hardest
thing about this new craft?

00:34:44.482 --> 00:34:45.940
DAVID DUCHOVNY:
Well, since I don't

00:34:45.940 --> 00:34:50.840
have to record my own guitar
on the album, that would've

00:34:50.840 --> 00:34:55.260
been the hardest because
I'm kind of self-taught

00:34:55.260 --> 00:34:58.682
with the guitar because one
of ideas for me when I wanted

00:34:58.682 --> 00:35:00.390
to start playing guitar
was I didn't want

00:35:00.390 --> 00:35:01.400
it to feel like work at all.

00:35:01.400 --> 00:35:02.560
So I was like, no lessons.

00:35:02.560 --> 00:35:04.580
I don't want lessons.

00:35:04.580 --> 00:35:07.380
So that was stupid because
I have really bad habits,

00:35:07.380 --> 00:35:10.530
and I can't play the same
thing twice the same way.

00:35:10.530 --> 00:35:12.860
So it's not good for me
to ever record, probably.

00:35:12.860 --> 00:35:14.760
I'll never be able
to break that habit.

00:35:14.760 --> 00:35:20.185
But the hardest part was
just my voice, really.

00:35:20.185 --> 00:35:21.560
I mean, I've never
been a singer.

00:35:21.560 --> 00:35:25.630
And I've often been
told to stop singing.

00:35:25.630 --> 00:35:27.650
[LAUGHTER]

00:35:27.650 --> 00:35:28.432
It's true.

00:35:28.432 --> 00:35:30.640
And the fact that I'm up
here singing in front of you

00:35:30.640 --> 00:35:36.000
is unbelievable to me.

00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:37.600
I'm not kidding.

00:35:37.600 --> 00:35:43.050
So when I started talking
to Brad about recording,

00:35:43.050 --> 00:35:46.660
I found a voice teacher
New York, just by chance,

00:35:46.660 --> 00:35:51.160
who was amazing-- is amazing--
a guy named Don Lawrence.

00:35:51.160 --> 00:35:54.350
And in 20 minutes he
had me, not singing,

00:35:54.350 --> 00:35:56.330
but he had me thinking
about singing in a way

00:35:56.330 --> 00:35:58.410
that I'd never thought before.

00:35:58.410 --> 00:36:03.450
And it's amazing when you find
a real teacher, just very lucky.

00:36:03.450 --> 00:36:08.740
And so I've been just practicing
singing for a year now.

00:36:08.740 --> 00:36:10.960
Every day I sing a little bit.

00:36:10.960 --> 00:36:13.022
I do my scales.

00:36:13.022 --> 00:36:14.790
[LAUGHTER]

00:36:14.790 --> 00:36:17.360
DAVID DUCHOVNY: So you know,
that's been the hardest part,

00:36:17.360 --> 00:36:21.420
and just committing to
that and trying to sing.

00:36:21.420 --> 00:36:25.958
It's not me, but here I
am, subjecting you to it.

00:36:25.958 --> 00:36:27.830
[LAUGHTER]

00:36:27.830 --> 00:36:30.650
BRAD: We're going to go
with another question

00:36:30.650 --> 00:36:31.507
from the back right.

00:36:31.507 --> 00:36:32.840
AUDIENCE: Thanks for coming out.

00:36:32.840 --> 00:36:36.680
A quick question that you always
ask people who are into music,

00:36:36.680 --> 00:36:39.360
what have you been
listening to recently?

00:36:39.360 --> 00:36:40.940
Oh, hey, I'm in the light.

00:36:40.940 --> 00:36:43.100
What records have you been
listening to recently?

00:36:43.100 --> 00:36:43.960
Are there any bands?

00:36:43.960 --> 00:36:46.001
We've had a lot of bands
that come out of Boston.

00:36:46.001 --> 00:36:49.220
And just wanted to know what's
been inspiring you recently.

00:36:49.220 --> 00:36:54.200
DAVID DUCHOVNY: I tended not
to listen to music while we've

00:36:54.200 --> 00:36:57.040
been doing the
record, only because I

00:36:57.040 --> 00:37:00.010
find that if I read
when I'm writing,

00:37:00.010 --> 00:37:02.570
I tend to just write
what I'm reading.

00:37:02.570 --> 00:37:03.560
And that's illegal.

00:37:03.560 --> 00:37:08.390
[LAUGHTER]

00:37:11.310 --> 00:37:14.580
So I haven't really
been listening,

00:37:14.580 --> 00:37:18.630
but historically, I'm just
like a '60s, '70s guy.

00:37:18.630 --> 00:37:22.460
Straight ahead rock and roll,
British invasion, Beatles,

00:37:22.460 --> 00:37:25.050
Stones, Who, Zeppelin.

00:37:25.050 --> 00:37:28.840
But then I go to Tom Petty,
and I love Dylan and Wilco.

00:37:31.620 --> 00:37:33.290
R.E.M I love.

00:37:33.290 --> 00:37:36.680
I love a lot of
different kinds of music.

00:37:36.680 --> 00:37:39.382
BRAD: Your kids, you know
all the modern stuff too.

00:37:39.382 --> 00:37:40.840
Like, we were
hanging out yesterday

00:37:40.840 --> 00:37:42.548
and you were like this
is Arctic Monkeys.

00:37:42.548 --> 00:37:43.310
I love this band.

00:37:43.310 --> 00:37:43.970
And I was like, what?

00:37:43.970 --> 00:37:45.031
DAVID DUCHOVNY: Yeah, I'm hip.

00:37:45.031 --> 00:37:45.531
I'm hip.

00:37:45.531 --> 00:37:47.980
[LAUGHTER]

00:37:47.980 --> 00:37:51.200
I like Electric Field by MGMT.

00:37:51.200 --> 00:37:51.931
How old is that?

00:37:51.931 --> 00:37:52.930
It's already old, right?

00:37:52.930 --> 00:37:54.890
But I like it.

00:37:54.890 --> 00:37:55.860
You don't know it?

00:37:55.860 --> 00:37:56.640
Yeah, you know it.

00:37:56.640 --> 00:37:58.190
That's good groove, right?

00:37:58.190 --> 00:37:58.770
Next time.

00:37:58.770 --> 00:38:02.342
Next time, we'll do that.

00:38:02.342 --> 00:38:03.300
BRAD: Another question.

00:38:10.320 --> 00:38:13.990
Here we go, on the left.

00:38:13.990 --> 00:38:18.030
I think she's going
to bring the mic over.

00:38:18.030 --> 00:38:19.224
AUDIENCE: Oh, I'm Ed.

00:38:19.224 --> 00:38:20.140
DAVID DUCHOVNY: Hi Ed.

00:38:20.140 --> 00:38:22.865
AUDIENCE: I was listening to
the lyrics on your first song

00:38:22.865 --> 00:38:24.660
that you played and
I was wondering,

00:38:24.660 --> 00:38:26.790
do you wear a Fitbit?

00:38:26.790 --> 00:38:29.760
[LAUGHTER]

00:38:31.035 --> 00:38:32.910
Just because we have a
step competition here.

00:38:32.910 --> 00:38:33.410
So.

00:38:33.410 --> 00:38:35.046
Yeah.

00:38:35.046 --> 00:38:36.934
[LAUGHTER]

00:38:40.515 --> 00:38:42.390
DAVID DUCHOVNY: I'm
going to go out on a limb

00:38:42.390 --> 00:38:47.515
and say only at Google will I
be asked that question, I hope.

00:38:50.030 --> 00:38:54.840
It's funny because
just last weekend I

00:38:54.840 --> 00:38:57.240
made the journey of which
I was writing about.

00:38:57.240 --> 00:39:00.200
And I was like, I'm
going to count the steps.

00:39:00.200 --> 00:39:02.650
And I kept on getting lost.

00:39:02.650 --> 00:39:05.530
I had hundreds on my fingers.

00:39:05.530 --> 00:39:07.870
I do not have Fitbit.

00:39:07.870 --> 00:39:09.930
So I'm so old school.

00:39:09.930 --> 00:39:12.500
As they said in
Larry Sanders, they

00:39:12.500 --> 00:39:17.140
tore down my school to
build the old school.

00:39:17.140 --> 00:39:21.580
So I was like 100,
400, 500, 1,000.

00:39:21.580 --> 00:39:24.860
It was about, it was in
the neighborhood of 3,000.

00:39:24.860 --> 00:39:28.054
It might have been
a little less.

00:39:28.054 --> 00:39:31.360
[LAUGHTER]

00:39:31.360 --> 00:39:36.920
But the chorus doesn't
sound as good as 2,796.

00:39:36.920 --> 00:39:40.580
2,796.

00:39:40.580 --> 00:39:44.610
BRAD: I think we have
another one up here.

00:39:44.610 --> 00:39:46.120
AUDIENCE: Hi, I'm Bertha.

00:39:46.120 --> 00:39:48.480
I'm also writing
music right now.

00:39:48.480 --> 00:39:51.390
So what's your music
writing process?

00:39:51.390 --> 00:39:55.659
DAVID DUCHOVNY: It was
just whenever it happened.

00:39:55.659 --> 00:39:57.950
I mean, I'd sit down, and
I'd start playing the guitar.

00:39:57.950 --> 00:40:00.910
And I would have like
three or four chords

00:40:00.910 --> 00:40:02.550
that I liked the way
they fit together.

00:40:02.550 --> 00:40:05.570
And then and then
I would just maybe

00:40:05.570 --> 00:40:07.140
hear a melody on top of that.

00:40:07.140 --> 00:40:09.480
And then the words
were just easy.

00:40:09.480 --> 00:40:15.570
I mean, I had a booklet of
thoughts more than words.

00:40:15.570 --> 00:40:20.140
And that's it, just kind
all at the same time

00:40:20.140 --> 00:40:21.561
rather than one
before the other.

00:40:21.561 --> 00:40:23.560
But I would say the chords
and the melody first.

00:40:23.560 --> 00:40:27.070
And then lyrically, I never
worry about the lyrics coming.

00:40:27.070 --> 00:40:31.440
It was really, will I ever
think of another melody?

00:40:31.440 --> 00:40:32.310
And I'm not sure.

00:40:35.466 --> 00:40:36.590
BRAD: There's one up front.

00:40:36.590 --> 00:40:37.631
DAVID DUCHOVNY: A ringer.

00:40:37.631 --> 00:40:39.530
We have a ringer in the house.

00:40:39.530 --> 00:40:42.540
Full disclosure
before the question.

00:40:42.540 --> 00:40:43.207
Full disclosure.

00:40:43.207 --> 00:40:44.289
AUDIENCE: Full disclosure.

00:40:44.289 --> 00:40:45.152
We're related.

00:40:47.840 --> 00:40:50.640
So how do your kids
feel about Dad suddenly

00:40:50.640 --> 00:40:53.135
becoming a rock star?

00:40:53.135 --> 00:40:54.635
DAVID DUCHOVNY:
They're embarrassed.

00:40:57.726 --> 00:41:00.250
Yeah, they're like
making believe

00:41:00.250 --> 00:41:01.520
it's not happening at all.

00:41:01.520 --> 00:41:02.320
I'm sure they are.

00:41:02.320 --> 00:41:05.390
I mean, they have not
asked to hear anything.

00:41:08.340 --> 00:41:10.620
And I do have a concert.

00:41:10.620 --> 00:41:13.680
We have the album release
concert next week in New York,

00:41:13.680 --> 00:41:18.600
and I've not invited them.

00:41:18.600 --> 00:41:19.240
It's late.

00:41:19.240 --> 00:41:21.950
It's past their bedtime.

00:41:21.950 --> 00:41:24.800
It's funny.

00:41:24.800 --> 00:41:29.630
I can only think
and hope that they

00:41:29.630 --> 00:41:32.150
get exactly what I wanted
them to get out of it, which

00:41:32.150 --> 00:41:35.890
was just like, just try things.

00:41:35.890 --> 00:41:40.560
I think, because they would
do-- play a little something.

00:41:40.560 --> 00:41:43.015
This is how they react to it.

00:41:43.015 --> 00:41:45.430
[LAUGHTER]

00:41:48.330 --> 00:41:51.982
So that's what I get from them.

00:41:51.982 --> 00:41:53.690
BRAD: It is funny,
because sometimes we'd

00:41:53.690 --> 00:41:54.690
play at your house.

00:41:54.690 --> 00:41:56.180
It's like 100% music.

00:41:56.180 --> 00:41:58.510
And then when your kids
come home, it's 0% music.

00:41:58.510 --> 00:42:01.230
It's like we don't talk
about it in front of them.

00:42:01.230 --> 00:42:02.780
It's its own entity.

00:42:02.780 --> 00:42:04.280
DAVID DUCHOVNY:
It's a dirty secret.

00:42:04.280 --> 00:42:05.812
BRAD: Yeah.

00:42:05.812 --> 00:42:07.520
We have one more
question, then will do--

00:42:07.520 --> 00:42:09.770
DAVID DUCHOVNY: I do have
one song that's specifically

00:42:09.770 --> 00:42:11.420
for West called
"Stay on the Train"

00:42:11.420 --> 00:42:12.777
that we won't be doing here.

00:42:12.777 --> 00:42:14.360
BRAD: You're not
going to play at all?

00:42:14.360 --> 00:42:15.590
DAVID DUCHOVNY:
Unless you want to.

00:42:15.590 --> 00:42:16.910
BRAD: No, I think we
should do "Hell" maybe.

00:42:16.910 --> 00:42:17.480
DAVID DUCHOVNY: Oh,
you want to do "Hell"?

00:42:17.480 --> 00:42:17.990
OK.

00:42:17.990 --> 00:42:20.190
BRAD: But lets see
if we can do one more

00:42:20.190 --> 00:42:23.850
question, or a final question,
before the last song.

00:42:23.850 --> 00:42:27.210
Right up front here
on the right, or both.

00:42:27.210 --> 00:42:29.057
We'll do two more.

00:42:29.057 --> 00:42:29.890
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:42:29.890 --> 00:42:30.480
Hi, I'm Libby.

00:42:30.480 --> 00:42:34.305
DAVID DUCHOVNY: Can I
get a Fitbit for free?

00:42:34.305 --> 00:42:37.570
Can I get one for free?

00:42:37.570 --> 00:42:38.890
If you show me how to use it.

00:42:38.890 --> 00:42:40.617
Where do I put it?

00:42:40.617 --> 00:42:41.730
On my foot?

00:42:41.730 --> 00:42:43.110
[LAUGHTER]

00:42:43.110 --> 00:42:44.480
On your belt.

00:42:44.480 --> 00:42:46.750
BRAD: You've got to
Google this stuff, man.

00:42:46.750 --> 00:42:48.240
DAVID DUCHOVNY:
How does it know?

00:42:48.240 --> 00:42:50.060
That's incredible.

00:42:50.060 --> 00:42:52.127
I want a Fitbit.

00:42:52.127 --> 00:42:52.626
Huh?

00:42:55.340 --> 00:42:57.680
All hell's breaking loose now.

00:42:57.680 --> 00:42:58.750
All right.

00:42:58.750 --> 00:42:59.250
Where?

00:42:59.250 --> 00:43:01.440
BRAD: OK, we'll go to the
last question and then

00:43:01.440 --> 00:43:02.657
the final song.

00:43:02.657 --> 00:43:03.490
AUDIENCE: I'm Libby.

00:43:03.490 --> 00:43:06.440
I don't have a Fitbit.

00:43:06.440 --> 00:43:09.990
And so being a creative
person-- acting,

00:43:09.990 --> 00:43:13.100
and writing, and
now doing music--

00:43:13.100 --> 00:43:16.159
is there one, at this
particular moment,

00:43:16.159 --> 00:43:18.075
I'm sure that the singing
is, but is there one

00:43:18.075 --> 00:43:21.670
that you're surprised or
that really kind of fills

00:43:21.670 --> 00:43:23.970
your soul in a way that you
didn't really expect it to?

00:43:27.339 --> 00:43:28.130
DAVID DUCHOVNY: No.

00:43:28.130 --> 00:43:30.760
I think they all do something.

00:43:30.760 --> 00:43:35.300
I mean, I feel like
just an expressive

00:43:35.300 --> 00:43:38.100
person, like I'm just
trying to express something.

00:43:38.100 --> 00:43:42.580
And I'm having an image
right now of the cake thing

00:43:42.580 --> 00:43:46.470
when you squeeze the icing,
and it's different size nozzle

00:43:46.470 --> 00:43:47.450
sometimes.

00:43:47.450 --> 00:43:49.530
So that's gross.

00:43:49.530 --> 00:43:51.850
[LAUGHTER]

00:43:51.850 --> 00:43:54.430
So I guess that's the
way I feel I feel about.

00:43:58.130 --> 00:44:00.690
I just try to stay
creative, and try

00:44:00.690 --> 00:44:06.020
to stay-- whoa-- try to
stay alive and growing

00:44:06.020 --> 00:44:07.380
and challenged.

00:44:07.380 --> 00:44:11.386
And challenged, I
try to be challenged.

00:44:11.386 --> 00:44:15.960
You know, someone was asking me
yesterday, challenging myself.

00:44:15.960 --> 00:44:17.460
And I was like,
well, maybe it would

00:44:17.460 --> 00:44:19.287
be nice to not be challenged.

00:44:19.287 --> 00:44:21.370
Maybe it would be nice to
just relax a little bit.

00:44:21.370 --> 00:44:24.120
But apparently that's
not what I'm into.

00:44:24.120 --> 00:44:26.690
So that's all.

00:44:26.690 --> 00:44:27.800
I don't know.

00:44:27.800 --> 00:44:29.110
I love directing too.

00:44:29.110 --> 00:44:32.020
I haven't done much
of that recently.

00:44:32.020 --> 00:44:34.790
I like sitting in the
dark yelling instructions.

00:44:34.790 --> 00:44:36.234
[LAUGHTER]

00:44:36.234 --> 00:44:38.900
BRAD: So this is going to be the
last song, "Hell or Highwater."

00:44:38.900 --> 00:44:41.274
And then after the song if
everyone wants to stay seated,

00:44:41.274 --> 00:44:45.010
we'll do the group selfie shot.

00:44:45.010 --> 00:44:46.480
And thank everybody again.

00:44:46.480 --> 00:44:48.760
But this is the single,
"Hell or Highwater."

00:44:48.760 --> 00:44:51.380
DAVID DUCHOVNY: Thank you,
and thanks for coming out

00:44:51.380 --> 00:44:54.710
and being here, because, really,
this is like rehearsal for us.

00:44:54.710 --> 00:44:57.240
So it's great.

00:44:57.240 --> 00:44:59.230
Thank you for the
opportunity to rehearse

00:44:59.230 --> 00:45:03.155
with your lovely sound system.

00:45:03.155 --> 00:45:06.550
[MUSIC DAVID DUCHOVNY, "HELL OR
 HIGHWATER"]

00:50:37.344 --> 00:50:38.350
[APPLAUSE]

00:50:38.350 --> 00:50:40.250
DAVID DUCHOVNY: Thank you.
