00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:00.910
Great.

00:00:00.910 --> 00:00:04.300
Now that we understand what
the fuse location provider is,

00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:06.270
let's create a simple
application that uses it.

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:10.480
It's a very basic application that
contains a single text field.

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:12.970
When you run it,
your latitude is determined and

00:00:12.970 --> 00:00:14.710
written into this text field.

00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:17.390
If you don't already have
a development environment set up for

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:20.230
Android development,
check the videos linked below

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:23.210
from Developing Android Apps,
Android Fundamentals.

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:24.620
To get your environment set up for

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:28.430
location services, check back to
the intro lesson for this course.

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:29.530
Once you're good to go,

00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:33.199
we can build your first
location-sensitive app together.
