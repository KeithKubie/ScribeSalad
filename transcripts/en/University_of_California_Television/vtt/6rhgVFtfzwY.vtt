00:00:05.508 --> 00:00:08.591
(light upbeat music)

00:00:21.753 --> 00:00:24.500
- So yeah, I really want to follow on

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:28.357
in this wonderful vein
of discussion and thought

00:00:28.357 --> 00:00:31.144
that we've had so far today,

00:00:31.144 --> 00:00:32.360
Thinking about this question,

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:33.567
"Making an Old Brain Young."

00:00:33.567 --> 00:00:35.857
As I get older, I want to be younger,

00:00:35.857 --> 00:00:36.963
so this is part of it.

00:00:36.963 --> 00:00:40.501
But I really want to consider how we can

00:00:40.501 --> 00:00:44.735
take lessons from
understanding the child's brain

00:00:44.735 --> 00:00:47.941
and see if we can apply
them to the adult brain,

00:00:47.941 --> 00:00:52.108
or the aging brain, or the
brain with neural pathology.

00:00:54.031 --> 00:00:56.819
First, before I actually do that,

00:00:56.819 --> 00:01:00.069
I really want to talk about the concept

00:01:01.586 --> 00:01:03.265
of what a critical period is,

00:01:03.265 --> 00:01:07.629
and just remind you that a
developmental critical period

00:01:07.629 --> 00:01:12.171
is a period during which
time special experiences

00:01:12.171 --> 00:01:16.704
are essential for the later
function of the brain.

00:01:16.704 --> 00:01:19.418
That's because these
experiences are essential

00:01:19.418 --> 00:01:21.385
for tuning up brain circuits.

00:01:21.385 --> 00:01:24.357
I want to talk about that in
much more detail in a minute.

00:01:24.357 --> 00:01:27.411
But a good example of
developmental critical period

00:01:27.411 --> 00:01:29.840
that I have experienced, alas, myself,

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:31.349
is one for language learning.

00:01:31.349 --> 00:01:32.859
Obviously, you can learn throughout life.

00:01:32.859 --> 00:01:35.343
You can learn languages throughout life.

00:01:35.343 --> 00:01:38.416
But learning a language
without an accent as an adult

00:01:38.416 --> 00:01:40.239
is extremely difficult.

00:01:40.239 --> 00:01:42.877
Whereas, as we all know
now, it's extremely easy

00:01:42.877 --> 00:01:47.332
to learn many languages
perfectly as a young child.

00:01:47.332 --> 00:01:49.693
This has been my regret my whole life.

00:01:49.693 --> 00:01:53.615
Here's the concept, basically, which is,

00:01:53.615 --> 00:01:56.640
if we could only understand the underlying

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.829
molecular and cellular mechanisms

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:01.940
that regulate these
developmental critical periods,

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:03.660
maybe we could then apply them,

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:05.578
either in native repair,

00:02:05.578 --> 00:02:08.503
to reverse developmental neuropathology,

00:02:08.503 --> 00:02:10.573
or maybe even as a cognitive enhancer

00:02:10.573 --> 00:02:12.153
so I could learn French, for example,

00:02:12.153 --> 00:02:14.141
without an accent.

00:02:14.141 --> 00:02:18.086
Now, in trying to understand
how this works, obviously,

00:02:18.086 --> 00:02:21.136
at the level of molecules and cells,

00:02:21.136 --> 00:02:23.792
we really need to get into the brain.

00:02:23.792 --> 00:02:27.125
It's possible to do this in mice models.

00:02:27.991 --> 00:02:30.261
In fact, mice, as far as I know,

00:02:30.261 --> 00:02:33.888
have not been learning
second or third languages.

00:02:33.888 --> 00:02:38.511
But mice, just like us,
have binocular vision.

00:02:38.511 --> 00:02:40.076
Here's the question.

00:02:40.076 --> 00:02:43.594
Have you ever thought about
why it is you don't see double?

00:02:43.594 --> 00:02:45.644
What's happening is you have two eyes,

00:02:45.644 --> 00:02:47.819
and each eye is sending a complete view

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:50.180
of the visual world to your brain.

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:52.695
And yet we only see one view of the world

00:02:52.695 --> 00:02:54.718
unless there's some pathology.

00:02:54.718 --> 00:02:57.270
One of the reasons that
we don't see double

00:02:57.270 --> 00:03:01.386
is because, in fact, the
neural circuitry for vision

00:03:01.386 --> 00:03:05.365
brings the connections
from the two eyes together

00:03:05.365 --> 00:03:07.949
in the central part of
the visual pathways.

00:03:07.949 --> 00:03:10.231
Let me just show you a very simplified

00:03:10.231 --> 00:03:12.070
diagram of that now.

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:15.974
The point is that the output
neurons from the eyes,

00:03:15.974 --> 00:03:18.220
these RGCs, the ganglion cells,

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:23.157
send their connections to
central structures, like the LGN,

00:03:23.157 --> 00:03:26.129
and then beyond that from the LGN

00:03:26.129 --> 00:03:27.729
to the primary visual cortex.

00:03:27.729 --> 00:03:28.902
Vision doesn't happen,

00:03:28.902 --> 00:03:31.298
visual perception doesn't
happen in your eye.

00:03:31.298 --> 00:03:32.620
It happens in your brain.

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:35.788
These first few steps you can see already

00:03:35.788 --> 00:03:39.348
how the wiring is bringing
the two eyes together.

00:03:39.348 --> 00:03:42.318
For example, one of these RGCs here

00:03:42.318 --> 00:03:45.662
is sending its connection
across to this LGN.

00:03:45.662 --> 00:03:49.163
Another one from the other
eye is sending its connection.

00:03:49.163 --> 00:03:51.219
Already you can see that the information

00:03:51.219 --> 00:03:54.088
from the two eyes is
beginning to be combined.

00:03:54.088 --> 00:03:57.595
Then at the next stage in
information processing,

00:03:57.595 --> 00:04:00.589
that information is
again even more combined.

00:04:00.589 --> 00:04:02.882
In fact, there's a
rather rather beautiful,

00:04:02.882 --> 00:04:06.426
in this case, left eye, right eye,

00:04:06.426 --> 00:04:08.652
left eye, right eye, left eye, right eye

00:04:08.652 --> 00:04:11.408
kind of intermixing of the
inputs from the two eyes.

00:04:11.408 --> 00:04:14.029
Actually those intermixed inputs

00:04:14.029 --> 00:04:16.943
make connections finally with
these little gray circles

00:04:16.943 --> 00:04:19.903
and these connections
are the target neurons

00:04:19.903 --> 00:04:22.077
that, voila, become the basis for

00:04:22.077 --> 00:04:23.480
your binocular vision.

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:24.676
In other words, they're getting input

00:04:24.676 --> 00:04:27.364
from both the right eye and the left eye.

00:04:27.364 --> 00:04:29.681
Before I go further, I want to define more

00:04:29.681 --> 00:04:31.533
what I mean about connections.

00:04:31.533 --> 00:04:32.628
I'm talking about connections.

00:04:32.628 --> 00:04:35.543
But what I really mean
in neuroscience terms

00:04:35.543 --> 00:04:37.670
is synapses, the synapse.

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:39.006
What is a synapse?

00:04:39.006 --> 00:04:41.274
Let me just define a synapse.

00:04:41.274 --> 00:04:44.163
A synapse is the junction or connection

00:04:44.163 --> 00:04:47.989
between one neuron and the
next neuron along the line,

00:04:47.989 --> 00:04:49.931
passing information, and by the way,

00:04:49.931 --> 00:04:52.010
also doing some computations,

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:55.023
as the information is passed.

00:04:55.023 --> 00:04:57.968
In fact, you are your synapses.

00:04:57.968 --> 00:05:00.845
What I mean by that is,
your synapses get tuned up

00:05:00.845 --> 00:05:03.605
during developmental critical periods.

00:05:03.605 --> 00:05:05.901
Even if you are genetically identical

00:05:05.901 --> 00:05:08.389
to your sister, your twin, or whatever,

00:05:08.389 --> 00:05:11.034
in fact, your brain synapses are different

00:05:11.034 --> 00:05:12.718
because the pattern of tuning

00:05:12.718 --> 00:05:15.455
is slightly different in each case.

00:05:15.455 --> 00:05:17.113
So you are your synapses.

00:05:17.113 --> 00:05:20.015
Synapses change with learning.

00:05:20.015 --> 00:05:22.473
Memories are stored at synapses.

00:05:22.473 --> 00:05:27.045
Sadly, in Alzheimer's
disease, synapses are lost.

00:05:27.045 --> 00:05:30.602
Let's just remember
that as I talk further.

00:05:30.602 --> 00:05:34.352
Now, what's amazing is
that in animal models,

00:05:36.321 --> 00:05:39.321
it's possible to visualize synapses.

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:43.965
We can go down to the
level of just a few microns

00:05:43.965 --> 00:05:46.992
and actually see and test synapses

00:05:46.992 --> 00:05:49.624
and understand how they
work in the animal models

00:05:49.624 --> 00:05:54.046
like in the mice, or
even in higher mammals.

00:05:54.046 --> 00:05:56.087
Many years ago this experiment was done,

00:05:56.087 --> 00:05:58.984
and it's actually possible to visualize

00:05:58.984 --> 00:06:01.405
this really beautiful left eye, right eye,

00:06:01.405 --> 00:06:04.596
left eye, right eye, left
eye, right eye pattern

00:06:04.596 --> 00:06:08.177
of synapses in the visual cortex.

00:06:08.177 --> 00:06:11.044
I just want to show you
a very famous picture now

00:06:11.044 --> 00:06:14.158
from David Hubel and Torsten Wiesel's lab.

00:06:14.158 --> 00:06:16.308
At this scale, let me just point out,

00:06:16.308 --> 00:06:20.257
these white blobs over here on the left,

00:06:20.257 --> 00:06:22.882
they're supposed to be grains of rice.

00:06:22.882 --> 00:06:24.881
This gives you some sense of scale.

00:06:24.881 --> 00:06:26.543
Those are grains of rice.

00:06:26.543 --> 00:06:30.390
Here you see one eye,
let's say the right eye,

00:06:30.390 --> 00:06:34.299
was labeled with a white tracer substance

00:06:34.299 --> 00:06:36.803
that gets all the way to the visual cortex

00:06:36.803 --> 00:06:39.865
and labels all the synapses that are

00:06:39.865 --> 00:06:44.089
functionally connected
to the white right eye.

00:06:44.089 --> 00:06:46.019
So you can see, just what I told you,

00:06:46.019 --> 00:06:48.838
that there's this beautiful
right eye, left eye,

00:06:48.838 --> 00:06:52.173
right eye, left eye, right
eye, left eye striping pattern.

00:06:52.173 --> 00:06:54.747
At this scale, what you're
looking at really is

00:06:54.747 --> 00:06:58.230
hundreds of thousands of
these synapses at this scale,

00:06:58.230 --> 00:07:00.829
where every little dot is
about the size of a synapse.

00:07:00.829 --> 00:07:03.448
Now, when neural
scientists first discovered

00:07:03.448 --> 00:07:07.743
this beautiful striping pattern
of synaptic connections,

00:07:07.743 --> 00:07:09.839
they thought it had to be hard wired.

00:07:09.839 --> 00:07:12.245
It's much too beautiful,
much to reproducible,

00:07:12.245 --> 00:07:13.972
to be left to chance.

00:07:13.972 --> 00:07:17.193
But in fact it turns out that during

00:07:17.193 --> 00:07:20.561
a postnatal critical
period of development,

00:07:20.561 --> 00:07:22.891
this pattern has to be tuned up.

00:07:22.891 --> 00:07:26.538
In other words, even
using both eyes together

00:07:26.538 --> 00:07:28.646
for binocular vision requires

00:07:28.646 --> 00:07:31.043
an experience-dependent period.

00:07:31.043 --> 00:07:33.980
In fact, one way that this was discovered

00:07:33.980 --> 00:07:36.098
is in trying to understand
what's different

00:07:36.098 --> 00:07:38.966
between childhood cataract and cataract

00:07:38.966 --> 00:07:40.330
that you might get as an adult,

00:07:40.330 --> 00:07:42.100
or your grandmother might get as an adult.

00:07:42.100 --> 00:07:45.502
Where if you have normal
vision your whole life,

00:07:45.502 --> 00:07:49.375
and then you lose vision in one
eye for some period of time,

00:07:49.375 --> 00:07:51.210
when the optics are corrected,

00:07:51.210 --> 00:07:53.763
then you can see again
perfectly as an adult.

00:07:53.763 --> 00:07:57.192
That's because these
beautiful stripes are stable.

00:07:57.192 --> 00:08:00.510
However, during a developmental period

00:08:00.510 --> 00:08:01.854
these stripes are not stable.

00:08:01.854 --> 00:08:03.259
They're getting tuned up.

00:08:03.259 --> 00:08:05.925
If a child has a congenital cataract

00:08:05.925 --> 00:08:09.157
that's not corrected
early on in development,

00:08:09.157 --> 00:08:13.000
then the eye that's good gets way more

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:15.190
than it's fair share of territory,

00:08:15.190 --> 00:08:19.237
so way more white synapses
in the visual cortex

00:08:19.237 --> 00:08:21.589
than the bad eye gets.

00:08:21.589 --> 00:08:24.999
The bad eye actually loses
synaptic connections.

00:08:24.999 --> 00:08:27.151
In fact, those connections are pruned.

00:08:27.151 --> 00:08:28.901
Jay referred to this.

00:08:30.059 --> 00:08:31.906
I think several of our previous speakers

00:08:31.906 --> 00:08:33.813
talked about this idea of a period

00:08:33.813 --> 00:08:35.881
when there's a lot of synaptic remodeling

00:08:35.881 --> 00:08:37.907
and pruning going on.

00:08:37.907 --> 00:08:40.459
That's what I want to
really talk about now.

00:08:40.459 --> 00:08:42.590
Let me just summarize by saying,

00:08:42.590 --> 00:08:44.259
what you see now before your eyes

00:08:44.259 --> 00:08:48.446
is a really beautiful example
of synaptic plasticity,

00:08:48.446 --> 00:08:51.090
that is, the ability of a neural circuit

00:08:51.090 --> 00:08:55.185
to change its pattern of
connections based on use.

00:08:55.185 --> 00:08:57.722
This is an experience-dependent change.

00:08:57.722 --> 00:09:00.042
In this case, it happens only during

00:09:00.042 --> 00:09:01.621
a developmental critical period,

00:09:01.621 --> 00:09:04.543
in the sense that after the
critical period is over,

00:09:04.543 --> 00:09:07.198
which in us is around the age of six,

00:09:07.198 --> 00:09:09.739
these connections become stable,

00:09:09.739 --> 00:09:13.001
and they can't change this
dramatically at later ages,

00:09:13.001 --> 00:09:14.894
which is why Grandma can
see even after having

00:09:14.894 --> 00:09:17.597
a cataract for a long period of time,

00:09:17.597 --> 00:09:21.963
whereas the child, if the
cataract isn't fixed quite soon,

00:09:21.963 --> 00:09:25.014
will be permanently blind in
the eye that was not used.

00:09:25.014 --> 00:09:28.112
This is a real use it or
lose it kind of thing.

00:09:28.112 --> 00:09:31.085
Let me just summarize
here again by saying then,

00:09:31.085 --> 00:09:34.839
that the baby's brain, just
like the adolescent's brain,

00:09:34.839 --> 00:09:38.164
is not a miniature version
of the adult brain.

00:09:38.164 --> 00:09:40.699
It's a dynamically changing structure.

00:09:40.699 --> 00:09:42.669
Part of the change that's happening,

00:09:42.669 --> 00:09:44.606
and we can see it in the animal models,

00:09:44.606 --> 00:09:46.094
like mice, for example,

00:09:46.094 --> 00:09:48.935
is that there's this synaptic remodeling.

00:09:48.935 --> 00:09:51.437
Synaptic plasticity is the basis for

00:09:51.437 --> 00:09:54.225
these developmental critical periods.

00:09:54.225 --> 00:09:57.392
During this time, many immature synapses,

00:09:57.392 --> 00:10:02.247
the ones that are used get
strengthened and stabilized,

00:10:02.247 --> 00:10:05.242
and the ones that are not are pruned away.

00:10:05.242 --> 00:10:08.179
There's a kind of pruning
versus a growth period.

00:10:08.179 --> 00:10:12.133
So now the question is, how
in the world does this work?

00:10:12.133 --> 00:10:13.255
How is this happening?

00:10:13.255 --> 00:10:15.408
If we could only understand it,

00:10:15.408 --> 00:10:18.742
we could restore plasticity,
maybe, to the adult brain.

00:10:18.742 --> 00:10:20.777
But in order to do it, we
really have to understand

00:10:20.777 --> 00:10:23.699
what are the underlying
molecules and mechanisms

00:10:23.699 --> 00:10:25.354
that actually are responsible

00:10:25.354 --> 00:10:27.641
for this kind of pruning process.

00:10:27.641 --> 00:10:30.718
Many years ago, we worked very hard

00:10:30.718 --> 00:10:33.963
to discover molecules that
might be involved in pruning.

00:10:33.963 --> 00:10:36.332
I want to tell you about one.

00:10:36.332 --> 00:10:38.732
This molecule is a big mouthful.

00:10:38.732 --> 00:10:40.897
It's called PirB.

00:10:40.897 --> 00:10:45.798
It's called paired
immunoglobulin-like receptor B.

00:10:45.798 --> 00:10:47.906
It's very cool that it's a receptor.

00:10:47.906 --> 00:10:49.939
The reason I emphasize that is because

00:10:49.939 --> 00:10:51.932
if you have a receptor it can be targeted

00:10:51.932 --> 00:10:53.463
for a drug or a pill.

00:10:53.463 --> 00:10:55.120
As I said, this is like my dream,

00:10:55.120 --> 00:10:56.280
but we're not there yet.

00:10:56.280 --> 00:10:58.594
But it's good that it's a receptor.

00:10:58.594 --> 00:11:02.316
The question is, how can
we show that this molecule

00:11:02.316 --> 00:11:05.601
is actually involved in plasticity.

00:11:05.601 --> 00:11:10.199
One way that it's possible,
in a mouse anyhow, is,

00:11:10.199 --> 00:11:12.432
well, first I should
say that this molecule

00:11:12.432 --> 00:11:13.883
is present in the brain.

00:11:13.883 --> 00:11:15.334
It's in the neurons.

00:11:15.334 --> 00:11:17.732
Happily, it's in our
favorite parts of the brain

00:11:17.732 --> 00:11:19.546
that we like to study all the time,

00:11:19.546 --> 00:11:21.651
the visual cortex in the mouse,

00:11:21.651 --> 00:11:23.594
and the hippocampus in the mouse.

00:11:23.594 --> 00:11:24.882
So it's there.

00:11:24.882 --> 00:11:27.536
Now, how can we actually
study its function?

00:11:27.536 --> 00:11:30.766
Well, in mice it's possible to remove

00:11:30.766 --> 00:11:33.654
that particular molecule by taking away

00:11:33.654 --> 00:11:36.566
just that gene from the
whole genome of the mouse.

00:11:36.566 --> 00:11:38.343
There are 30,000 genes or so,

00:11:38.343 --> 00:11:40.360
and one can remove just that gene,

00:11:40.360 --> 00:11:44.254
from the very beginning of
development, for instance.

00:11:44.254 --> 00:11:48.519
We can make, what's known
as a PirB gene knockout.

00:11:48.519 --> 00:11:51.550
We can then either remove the gene

00:11:51.550 --> 00:11:53.048
from the very beginning of development.

00:11:53.048 --> 00:11:54.886
Or if we're really fancy
we can take it away

00:11:54.886 --> 00:11:57.753
at any time of life, and then we can test

00:11:57.753 --> 00:12:02.676
is this gene needed for
whatever, synaptic plasticity.

00:12:02.676 --> 00:12:04.889
The bottom line is, what we discovered,

00:12:04.889 --> 00:12:08.804
is that in fact, in these gene knockouts,

00:12:08.804 --> 00:12:12.482
in fact there is, not
only is the gene needed,

00:12:12.482 --> 00:12:16.584
but there's actually more
synaptic plasticity than normal.

00:12:16.584 --> 00:12:18.082
I'm happy to talk about this later,

00:12:18.082 --> 00:12:19.485
but just take my word for it.

00:12:19.485 --> 00:12:23.280
PirB is needed for synaptic plasticity.

00:12:23.280 --> 00:12:25.604
Then we asked how is this happening?

00:12:25.604 --> 00:12:28.259
What is actually going on?

00:12:28.259 --> 00:12:31.346
You already know the
answer, because I told you.

00:12:31.346 --> 00:12:34.259
I told you that synaptic plasticity

00:12:34.259 --> 00:12:36.903
involves both pruning and strengthening

00:12:36.903 --> 00:12:38.447
of certain connections.

00:12:38.447 --> 00:12:40.262
So we thought, let's look at pruning

00:12:40.262 --> 00:12:42.595
in these PirB knockout mice.

00:12:44.065 --> 00:12:46.564
To make a long story
short, what we discovered

00:12:46.564 --> 00:12:48.390
is that pruning is deficient.

00:12:48.390 --> 00:12:50.882
The way we did this
experiment was to label

00:12:50.882 --> 00:12:53.244
some of our favorite neurons in the brain,

00:12:53.244 --> 00:12:56.241
these little green dots, with
a green tracer substance,

00:12:56.241 --> 00:12:59.176
and then we could actually look at

00:12:59.176 --> 00:13:01.292
very high power, over here.

00:13:01.292 --> 00:13:04.497
We could look at these
little protuberances,

00:13:04.497 --> 00:13:07.213
which are the sites of the synaptic inputs

00:13:07.213 --> 00:13:08.965
to these particular neurons.

00:13:08.965 --> 00:13:11.307
Then we could count them all.

00:13:11.307 --> 00:13:14.731
When we did that experiment
in normal, wild type

00:13:14.731 --> 00:13:17.400
versus PirB knockout
mice, what we discovered

00:13:17.400 --> 00:13:20.089
is that there were actually
way more of these connections

00:13:20.089 --> 00:13:22.805
in the knockout mice than
in the wild type mice,

00:13:22.805 --> 00:13:25.775
and that actually persisted
all the way into adulthood.

00:13:25.775 --> 00:13:28.277
What we'd actually discovered is that

00:13:28.277 --> 00:13:32.545
somehow PirB is required
for synaptic pruning.

00:13:32.545 --> 00:13:36.151
In the absence of PirB,
so in this knockout mouse,

00:13:36.151 --> 00:13:38.570
what we discovered is that
pruning was deficient.

00:13:38.570 --> 00:13:43.093
The seesaw went in favor
of synapse formation,

00:13:43.093 --> 00:13:47.216
genesis, and stabilization,
and away from synaptic pruning.

00:13:47.216 --> 00:13:49.321
Okay, now there's a lot more
one could say about this.

00:13:49.321 --> 00:13:51.129
But actually what I really
want to talk about is,

00:13:51.129 --> 00:13:54.037
boing, a lightbulb went off for us.

00:13:54.037 --> 00:13:55.990
Actually, a few lightbulbs
went off for us.

00:13:55.990 --> 00:13:57.591
But I want to tell you about one.

00:13:57.591 --> 00:13:59.103
Here's the lightbulb.

00:13:59.103 --> 00:14:02.917
The lightbulb is that
in Alzheimer's disease

00:14:02.917 --> 00:14:05.750
there's excessive synapse pruning.

00:14:06.743 --> 00:14:09.540
This is thought to be
caused, at least in part,

00:14:09.540 --> 00:14:13.540
by these bad plaques and
tangles that are formed

00:14:14.984 --> 00:14:19.151
by the accumulation of a
substance called beta amyloid,

00:14:20.653 --> 00:14:23.190
which actually conglomerates to make

00:14:23.190 --> 00:14:25.601
very large plaques and tangles.

00:14:25.601 --> 00:14:27.679
It's thought that this beta amyloid

00:14:27.679 --> 00:14:31.062
is part of what's responsible for

00:14:31.062 --> 00:14:34.132
loss of memory in Alzheimer's disease.

00:14:34.132 --> 00:14:37.255
So question is, is PirB involved?

00:14:37.255 --> 00:14:40.144
Because remember, PirB
is needed for pruning,

00:14:40.144 --> 00:14:43.601
and here we have too much
pruning in Alzheimer's disease.

00:14:43.601 --> 00:14:44.651
How would you study that?

00:14:44.651 --> 00:14:47.315
Well, we've studied it in a
large variety of different ways.

00:14:47.315 --> 00:14:49.992
But the first way is, PirB knockout mice,

00:14:49.992 --> 00:14:52.546
please meet Alzheimer's disease mice.

00:14:52.546 --> 00:14:54.540
What do I mean by that?

00:14:54.540 --> 00:14:58.433
Neuroscientists can make
mouse models of disease.

00:14:58.433 --> 00:15:00.395
What they can do is they can actually

00:15:00.395 --> 00:15:04.500
put into the mouse the human disease gene,

00:15:04.500 --> 00:15:06.072
the mutated gene.

00:15:06.072 --> 00:15:08.792
Sadly for the mice, but thank you mice,

00:15:08.792 --> 00:15:12.292
the mice can then end up
with the human disease.

00:15:12.292 --> 00:15:14.153
In the case of Alzheimer's mice,

00:15:14.153 --> 00:15:15.896
there are a variety of models.

00:15:15.896 --> 00:15:18.492
In this case there are two genes

00:15:18.492 --> 00:15:22.538
that are known to cause
early-onset family Alzheimer's.

00:15:22.538 --> 00:15:24.527
Both of these are put into the mouse,

00:15:24.527 --> 00:15:27.492
and the mouse, at about
nine months of age,

00:15:27.492 --> 00:15:29.105
gets the plaques and tangles,

00:15:29.105 --> 00:15:32.188
and sadly also a serious memory loss.

00:15:33.637 --> 00:15:36.156
What we did is we decided,

00:15:36.156 --> 00:15:38.915
let's see what happens if we remove PirB.

00:15:38.915 --> 00:15:41.191
Remember, if we remove PirB,

00:15:41.191 --> 00:15:44.053
then there's no pruning that happens.

00:15:44.053 --> 00:15:48.333
What happens in Alzheimer's
mice that don't have PirB,

00:15:48.333 --> 00:15:51.475
and amazingly when we studied
their memory performance

00:15:51.475 --> 00:15:54.381
at nine months of age, they were protected

00:15:54.381 --> 00:15:59.260
from memory loss in the
absence of the PirB molecule.

00:15:59.260 --> 00:16:00.759
That actually kind of makes sense.

00:16:00.759 --> 00:16:01.795
It's rather exciting.

00:16:01.795 --> 00:16:03.523
At least to me it is.

00:16:03.523 --> 00:16:05.273
How does this happen?

00:16:06.446 --> 00:16:08.821
Again, to make another
really long story short,

00:16:08.821 --> 00:16:11.908
what we discovered is this PirB receptor

00:16:11.908 --> 00:16:15.408
is actually hijacked by this beta amyloid.

00:16:16.263 --> 00:16:17.545
What do I mean by hijacked?

00:16:17.545 --> 00:16:20.592
What I mean is that PirB, as I said,

00:16:20.592 --> 00:16:23.354
is a receptor, which always
gets everybody excited

00:16:23.354 --> 00:16:24.991
in terms of making drugs.

00:16:24.991 --> 00:16:27.552
A receptor is a protein on a cell

00:16:27.552 --> 00:16:29.133
that does work for the cell.

00:16:29.133 --> 00:16:31.917
It takes information
from outside of the cell

00:16:31.917 --> 00:16:33.943
and it actually transfers that information

00:16:33.943 --> 00:16:36.732
to the inside of the cell
where it can do work.

00:16:36.732 --> 00:16:39.838
In the case of PirB, that information

00:16:39.838 --> 00:16:41.819
is part of the pruning process.

00:16:41.819 --> 00:16:44.204
There are normal ligands for PirB,

00:16:44.204 --> 00:16:46.518
including this thing called MHC class 1.

00:16:46.518 --> 00:16:49.488
What we think is happening
is that beta amyloid

00:16:49.488 --> 00:16:52.103
is also binding to this PirB molecule

00:16:52.103 --> 00:16:54.603
and driving pruning to excess.

00:16:55.497 --> 00:16:57.717
The other point I want to
make is that it turns out

00:16:57.717 --> 00:17:01.800
that there are actually
human homologues of PirB.

00:17:02.858 --> 00:17:04.396
There are quite a number of them.

00:17:04.396 --> 00:17:06.302
What we discovered is that one of them,

00:17:06.302 --> 00:17:08.084
called, another mouthful, I'm not even

00:17:08.084 --> 00:17:09.064
going to write it out for you,

00:17:09.064 --> 00:17:12.203
it's called L-I-L-R-B-2.

00:17:12.203 --> 00:17:14.590
So it's very similar to PirB.

00:17:14.590 --> 00:17:17.784
This human homologue also binds,

00:17:17.784 --> 00:17:21.151
it seems to be hijacked by beta amyloid,

00:17:21.151 --> 00:17:25.028
and it's also present
in the human forebrain,

00:17:25.028 --> 00:17:28.578
and the signaling caused by binding

00:17:28.578 --> 00:17:31.306
of beta amyloid seems to be also derailed

00:17:31.306 --> 00:17:33.322
in the same way in the
human Alzheimer brain

00:17:33.322 --> 00:17:34.885
as it is the mouse brain.

00:17:34.885 --> 00:17:37.342
Now I'm going to summarize.

00:17:37.342 --> 00:17:40.923
What I've suggested is
that Alzheimer's disease,

00:17:40.923 --> 00:17:44.425
which is thought to be a
problem of synapse pruning,

00:17:44.425 --> 00:17:48.375
may be driven by beta
amyloid-PirB interactions.

00:17:48.375 --> 00:17:50.057
Definitely worth following that up.

00:17:50.057 --> 00:17:53.307
So pruning is accelerated in this case.

00:17:55.214 --> 00:17:57.883
What it also suggests to us is

00:17:57.883 --> 00:18:00.523
there might be a pill in there after all.

00:18:00.523 --> 00:18:03.751
What's great is that we
could even maybe make a pill

00:18:03.751 --> 00:18:05.915
based on the fact that
there's a receptor here.

00:18:05.915 --> 00:18:07.605
We know exactly what to do.

00:18:07.605 --> 00:18:09.330
In fact, we have made a little pill

00:18:09.330 --> 00:18:11.731
and tried it out in mice.

00:18:11.731 --> 00:18:15.398
The last point I want
to make is stay tuned.

00:18:16.909 --> 00:18:19.137
I think it's really interesting that PirB,

00:18:19.137 --> 00:18:21.651
or LilrB blockade might represent

00:18:21.651 --> 00:18:25.489
a slightly different therapeutic approach

00:18:25.489 --> 00:18:26.608
for treating Alzheimer's,

00:18:26.608 --> 00:18:28.901
but maybe also other pruning disorders.

00:18:28.901 --> 00:18:31.062
Now, this might be
good, in that sense that

00:18:31.062 --> 00:18:32.638
I don't know if you read recently,

00:18:32.638 --> 00:18:34.422
but there was another failure of another

00:18:34.422 --> 00:18:37.839
major Lilly Alzheimer disease drug trial.

00:18:38.969 --> 00:18:41.266
It's really, I'm like, I'm getting older.

00:18:41.266 --> 00:18:43.234
I would really like something soon.

00:18:43.234 --> 00:18:46.511
I want these trials to succeed.

00:18:46.511 --> 00:18:47.524
But maybe there's a pill.

00:18:47.524 --> 00:18:50.223
But even more interesting I think is that

00:18:50.223 --> 00:18:52.140
in fact lessons from neural development

00:18:52.140 --> 00:18:54.381
may offer new treatment avenues

00:18:54.381 --> 00:18:57.170
for Alzheimer's disease and
other pruning disorders.

00:18:57.170 --> 00:18:58.843
With that, I just want to thank everyone.

00:18:58.843 --> 00:18:59.676
Thank you all.

00:18:59.676 --> 00:19:02.442
Also, I want to thank our organizers.

00:19:02.442 --> 00:19:06.033
I have to remind everyone
that this experiment was done,

00:19:06.033 --> 00:19:08.367
these kinds of experiments,
with many, many

00:19:08.367 --> 00:19:10.747
students and colleagues and someone,

00:19:10.747 --> 00:19:13.249
and I would also like to thank the mice.

00:19:13.249 --> 00:19:14.082
Thanks, everyone.

00:19:14.082 --> 00:19:14.915
(applause)

00:19:14.915 --> 00:19:18.082
(light upbeat music)
