00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:02.590
So I've got two parallel lines.

00:00:02.590 --> 00:00:05.240
So that's the first
line right over there

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:08.200
and then the second
line right over here.

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:10.730
Let me denote that
these are parallel.

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:12.960
These are parallel lines.

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:15.780
Actually, I can do that
a little bit neater.

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:21.510
And let me draw a transversal,
so a line that intersects both

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:25.030
of these parallel lines,
so something like that.

00:00:25.030 --> 00:00:29.120
And now let's say
that we are told

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:36.150
that this angle right
over here is 9x plus 88.

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:37.720
And this is in degrees.

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:42.680
And we're also told that
this angle right over here

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:48.850
is 6x plus 182, once
again, in degrees.

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:52.840
So my goal here and my question
for you is, can we figure out

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:54.549
what these angles
actually are, given

00:00:54.549 --> 00:00:57.090
that these are parallel lines
and this is a transversal line?

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.170
And I encourage you
to pause this video

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:02.330
to try this on your own.

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:07.840
Well, the key here to realize
is that these right over here

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:09.730
are related by the
fact that they're

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:13.070
formed from a transversal
intersecting parallel lines.

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:16.310
And we know, for example,
that this angle corresponds

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:17.920
to this angle right over here.

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:19.920
They're going to be
congruent angles.

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.230
And so this is 6x plus 182.

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:27.270
This is also going
to be 6x plus 182.

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:30.190
And then that helps us
realize that this blue angle

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:31.850
and this orange
angle are actually

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:32.980
going to be supplementary.

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:35.920
They're going to add up to 180
degrees, because put together,

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:38.290
when you make them
adjacent, their outer rays

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:40.190
form a line right over here.

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:49.460
So we know that 6x plus
182 plus 9x plus 88

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:53.480
is going to be equal
to 180 degrees.

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:58.940
And now we just have
to simplify this thing.

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:03.380
So 6x plus 9x is
going to give us 15x.

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:06.510
And then we have 182 plus 88.

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:10.030
Let's see, 182 plus 8,
would get us to 190.

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:11.750
And then we add another 80.

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:18.700
It gets us to 270-- plus
270-- is equal to 180.

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:21.740
If we subtract 270
from both sides,

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:26.300
we get 15x is equal
to negative 90.

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:31.650
And now we can divide
both sides by 15.

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:37.460
And we get x is equal
to-- what is this?

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:42.370
Let's see, 6 times 15
is 60 plus 30 is 90.

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:46.380
So x is going to be
equal to negative 6.

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:47.960
So far, we've made
a lot of progress.

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:53.020
We figured out what x is equal
to. x is equal to negative 6,

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:55.990
but we still haven't figured out
what these angles are equal to.

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:59.050
So this angle right
over here, 9x plus 88,

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:06.950
this is going to be equal to
9 times negative 6 plus 88.

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:10.033
9 times negative
6 is negative 54.

00:03:13.332 --> 00:03:15.290
Let me write this down
before I make a mistake.

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:19.230
Negative 54 plus
88 is going to be--

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:25.550
let's see, to go from 88 minus
54 will give us 34 degrees.

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:28.380
So this is equal to 34,
and it's in degrees.

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:31.910
So this orange angle
right here is 34 degrees.

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:35.770
The blue angle is going
to be 180 minus that.

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:38.480
But we can verify that by
actually evaluating 6x plus

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:39.720
182.

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:42.780
So this is going to be
equal to 6 times negative 6

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:46.490
is negative 36 plus 182.

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:50.440
So this is going to
be equal to-- let's

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:55.560
see, if I subtract the
6 first, I get to 176.

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:59.000
So this gets us to 146 degrees.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:03.205
And you can verify-- 146 plus
34 is equal to 180 degrees.

00:04:08.917 --> 00:04:11.250
Now, we could also figure out
the other angles from this

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:12.080
as well.

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:15.590
We know that if
this is 34 degrees,

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:17.490
then this must be
34 degrees as well.

00:04:17.490 --> 00:04:19.190
Those are opposite angles.

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:21.209
This angle also
corresponds to this angle

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:23.340
so it must also be
34 degrees, which

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:26.950
is opposite to this angle,
which is going to be 34 degrees.

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:30.660
Similarly, if this one right
over here is 146 degrees,

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:33.160
we already know that this
one is going to be 146.

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:35.880
This one's going to be
146 since it's opposite.

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:39.856
And that's going to be
146 degrees as well.
