00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:01.340
I hate RomComs.

00:00:01.340 --> 00:00:02.779
They're full of the same tired tropes.

00:00:02.779 --> 00:00:06.400
For example, when sperm and egg meet, there's
a LITERAL SPARK.

00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:07.400
Ugh.

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:09.460
So, over it.

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:13.599
Hello everyone!

00:00:13.599 --> 00:00:15.019
I'm Crystal here for DNews.

00:00:15.019 --> 00:00:19.790
Recently, researchers from Northwestern University
reported the discovery a “zinc spark”

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:21.110
in human oocytes.

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:25.070
This phenomena, known to occur in other mammalian
species, is the result of sudden releases

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:27.430
of zinc after egg fertilization.

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:31.900
Before mammalian eggs or oocytes are either
released by the ovaries or harvested by a

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:34.460
doctor,
they absorb billions of zinc atoms that act

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:38.710
as a signal for them to halt meiosis cell
division and wait to be fertilized.

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:41.089
They're in a holding pattern until they meet
a sperm.

00:00:41.089 --> 00:00:46.530
If they DO meet one… at that moment of fertilization
several things have to happen all at once.

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:51.199
First, the egg has to protect itself from
the insertion of DNA from multiple sperm,

00:00:51.199 --> 00:00:55.360
which it does by using sodium ions to set
up an electric fence around the cell.

00:00:55.360 --> 00:01:00.039
Then, it releases calcium to, among other
things, harden the outer vitelline membrane

00:01:00.039 --> 00:01:03.550
surrounding the egg and make it impenetrable
to other sperm.

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:07.980
Once it's protected itself it needs to rev
up its metabolism and start dividing.

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:13.410
But it can only do that by releasing all its
zinc ions in a series of strong bursts.

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:15.140
Scientists call these “sparks”!

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:18.490
Zinc sparks have been observed in a bunch
of other mammals, but until this study we

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:20.930
weren't sure whether they occurred in humans.

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:25.630
To determine whether we do it too, scientists
bathed human oocytes in a petri dish of fluorescent

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:28.740
dye that can only emit light when zinc is
present.

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:33.130
At the beginning of the experiment all the
zinc was inside the cells so they saw no signal,

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:37.290
but then they injected an RNA construct into
the oocytes to emulate fertilization, and

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:38.290
it worked!

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:42.700
They observed a burst of light from around
some eggs indicating their zinc had been released.

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:46.990
To be clear, scientists didn't want to make
actual humans in the lab, so they didn't ACTUALLY

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:48.640
fertilize the eggs with human sperm.

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:53.020
Instead, scientists used a synthetic blank
RNA construct common in this type of experiment.

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:56.730
From the study results, the scientists were
able to conclude that human eggs, like those

00:01:56.730 --> 00:02:01.180
of mice and non-human primates do exhibit
the “zinc spark” (which is cool), *and*

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:06.590
that the zinc signal can be used as an indication
of health and embryonic progression after

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:07.590
fertilization!

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:08.590
This is even cooler!

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:11.390
If this technique were to migrate from the
lab to the doctor's office, it could have

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:17.549
a significant impact on In-Vitro Fertilization
(IVF) because that spark is proof that progression

00:02:17.549 --> 00:02:19.349
into an embryo has begun.

00:02:19.349 --> 00:02:23.249
While you will probably never see these zinc
sparks, they're happening every time a sperm

00:02:23.249 --> 00:02:28.341
successfully fertilizes an egg -- this "spark
of life" can tell researchers and IVF doctors

00:02:28.341 --> 00:02:29.909
which eggs are good.

00:02:29.909 --> 00:02:34.510
This is helpful, because IVF normally involves
artificially bringing together harvested eggs

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:36.620
and sperm from potential parents.

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:40.670
After they meet, the zygotes are implanted
into the woman's womb, then… everyone crosses

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:45.340
their fingers, and they often implant more
than one, to increase the odds of success.

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:49.659
Even still, the CDC reports women under 35
have the best chance for IVF success, but

00:02:49.659 --> 00:02:52.079
that rate is only around 40%.

00:02:52.079 --> 00:02:56.109
The ability to visualize these newly discovered
zinc bursts at the time of fertilization could

00:02:56.109 --> 00:03:00.999
guide selection of healthy, successfully fertilized
eggs for implantation improving pregnancy

00:03:00.999 --> 00:03:05.650
success rates, reducing the need for repeat
procedures, lowering costs and easing the

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:09.439
long, expensive and emotionally draining process
for potential parents.

00:03:09.439 --> 00:03:10.680
