[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:04.176 --> 00:00:10.070
- I would now like to introduce
Catherine Wagner, Katie.

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:13.580
Katie is an assistant professor
in the Department of Biology

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:16.610
and Diversity Institute at
the University of Wyoming.

00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:18.680
She is our fish person.

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:22.000
And I say that in the best way.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.250
Katie will talk to us about
the evolution and diversity

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:28.850
of the East African
cichlid fish.

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:31.690
And I don't want to
take up too much time.

00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:33.920
I have a whole thing I was
going to say about you,

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:36.870
but I'm going to actually have
you come up and give your talk,

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:39.038
since we're running very long.

00:00:39.038 --> 00:00:40.994
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:45.420
- OK.

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.670
It's wonderful to
be here today, and I

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:49.710
am glad that I can take
the focus a little bit

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:53.770
away from humans and
move towards fish.

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:55.710
So just to introduce
you a little bit

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:00.250
to these fish called cichlids,
this is a family of fish.

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:04.500
They're diverse in South
America and in Central America.

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:08.190
They're also found in southern
India and in the Middle East.

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:11.490
And even if you don't think that
you are familiar with cichlids,

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:14.670
you may actually be familiar
with them on your plate,

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:18.060
because tilapia is
an African cichlid.

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:21.060
And tilapia is one of the
most commonly farmed fish

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:22.440
in the world.

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:25.920
So tilapia is one of many
thousands of cichlids

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:27.350
that live in Africa.

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:30.060
They're exceptionally diverse.

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.850
And within the East
African Rift Lakes

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:36.450
alone, there are more
than 1,500 endemic species

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:39.120
of cichlid fishes.

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:42.600
In the three Great Lakes,
Victoria, Tanganyika,

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:46.320
and Malawi, there is the
independent evolution

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:50.910
of hundreds of these cichlid
species in each of these lakes.

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:54.090
These fish have exceptional
diversity and ecology

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:57.750
and in morphology, and
they form independently

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:02.010
in each of these lakes what
we call adaptive radiations.

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:05.460
Adaptive radiations
are the rapid origin

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:08.669
of ecological and species
diversity via descent

00:02:08.669 --> 00:02:11.920
with modification from
a common ancestor.

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:14.160
So this process of
adaptive radiation

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:17.340
has happened independently
in each of these three Great

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:19.890
Lakes, and also in
many other lakes

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:23.230
across the African continent.

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:25.470
So in this process of
adaptive radiation,

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:29.220
from a generalized ancestor
we have the evolution

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:32.610
of specialized ecology
such that, within each

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:35.430
of these cichlid
adaptive radiations,

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:37.350
we have the evolution
of fish that

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:40.530
are specialized to eat
scales of other fish,

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:42.570
fish that are specialized
to eat algae off

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:45.270
of rocks in all kinds
of different ways,

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:47.580
fish that have
funny fat lips that

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:51.570
help them eat invertebrates
between cracks in rocks,

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:54.450
other fish that have these
jaws in their throat called

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:58.050
pharyngeal jaws that
help them crush mollusks,

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:00.990
and also all kinds
of specializations

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:02.580
to eat other fish.

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:06.070
So these are what
we call piscivores.

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:09.570
You can also see that these
fish are exceptionally diverse

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:14.320
in color and in
body shape and size.

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:16.690
And the thing that I
want to emphasize here

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:19.660
is that, within these
cichlid adaptive radiations,

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:22.621
we're essentially
evolving entire food webs.

00:03:22.621 --> 00:03:25.120
One thing I like to say is that
the only thing that cichlids

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:27.590
can't do is photosynthesize.

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:31.750
So we're evolving everything
from the primary consumers

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:34.780
in these ecosystems up
to the top predators

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:37.360
in these ecosystems.

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:38.980
And this is, as I
mentioned before,

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:42.290
happened in dozens of lakes
across the African continent.

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:44.650
And this plot, in
the red, shows lakes

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:47.320
where there has
been the evolution

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:49.500
of endemic cichlid species.

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:52.960
And then gray shows lakes where
there are cichlid species,

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:57.830
but no endemic species
have evolved there.

00:03:57.830 --> 00:04:01.420
So if we were to draw an analog
with another famous example

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:04.510
of adaptive radiation,
these are Darwin's finches

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:06.040
from the Galapagos.

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:09.130
And Darwin's finches
are famous because,

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:12.430
from a single common
ancestor in the Galapagos,

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:16.060
there has evolved about 18
species that have diverse bill

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:18.130
morphologies that
allow them to eat

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:21.480
all sorts of different things.

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:24.420
If we were to draw an analogy
between Darwin's finches

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:27.450
and cichlids, this would be
as if Darwin's finches had

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:31.530
done this not only once
but dozens of times,

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:33.630
and if some of these
Darwin's finch radiations

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:36.930
had hundreds of species
instead of the 18 species

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:38.820
that currently exist there.

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:45.270
So this lends itself to
thinking about African cichlids

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:49.590
as a grand natural experiment,
where we can ask questions

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:52.500
like, why do adaptive
radiations happen sometimes

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:53.640
and not others?

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:56.310
And what determines the
number of species that evolve

00:04:56.310 --> 00:04:58.840
within adaptive radiations?

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:01.140
So I'm going to touch
on three questions

00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:04.080
today that are
related to research

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:05.820
that I've been working on.

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:09.660
The first is, what predicts
when adaptive radiations happen?

00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:12.150
The second is, what influences
the number of species

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:14.490
that evolve within these lakes?

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:17.430
And then third, what
enables exceptionally rapid

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:19.110
diversification in some cases?

00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:24.160
So if we look at the
diversity of cichlids

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:28.210
across the African continent,
we can identify 38 times

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:30.280
where cichlids
have entered a lake

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:33.160
and then subsequently
diversified.

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:36.460
But we can identify
another 145 times

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:38.140
where a species
has entered a lake

00:05:38.140 --> 00:05:40.720
and has failed to diversify.

00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:44.540
So this data set us up
to ask the question,

00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:48.670
why do some lineages
diversify while others don't?

00:05:48.670 --> 00:05:52.000
So to address this
question, we put together

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:56.470
a data set including traits
of these species that

00:05:56.470 --> 00:05:59.380
were hypothesized to
influence speciation,

00:05:59.380 --> 00:06:02.260
the origin of new
species within cichlids.

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:05.110
So these are intrinsic
factors, factors

00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:08.650
related to the biology
of the organisms.

00:06:08.650 --> 00:06:11.470
We also included a lot
of potential predictors

00:06:11.470 --> 00:06:15.970
from the environment, aspects
of the lakes themselves,

00:06:15.970 --> 00:06:18.070
the environment that
these fish encounter

00:06:18.070 --> 00:06:19.810
when they colonize a lake.

00:06:19.810 --> 00:06:23.140
And so these are
extrinsic factors.

00:06:23.140 --> 00:06:26.190
And when we analyze all of these
potential predictors and models

00:06:26.190 --> 00:06:31.560
together, we invariably find
that the best models include

00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:34.610
both intrinsic and
extrinsic factors

00:06:34.610 --> 00:06:38.010
in predicting when cichlid
adaptive radiations happen.

00:06:38.010 --> 00:06:39.540
And so this leads
us to a picture

00:06:39.540 --> 00:06:43.230
of thinking about cichlid
adaptive radiations

00:06:43.230 --> 00:06:46.680
as happening as an interaction
between the intrinsic biology

00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:48.720
of the organisms
and the environment

00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:51.600
that they encounter.

00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:53.940
Specifically, three
of the predictors

00:06:53.940 --> 00:06:58.020
that come out as strong positive
influence on cichlid adaptive

00:06:58.020 --> 00:07:01.500
radiation are the depth of
the lake that the cichlids are

00:07:01.500 --> 00:07:05.700
found in; energy, so this
is solar radiation hitting

00:07:05.700 --> 00:07:09.930
the lake; and also the presence
of sexual dichromatism, which

00:07:09.930 --> 00:07:13.380
is differences in colors
between males and females.

00:07:13.380 --> 00:07:16.110
And that strength of
sexual dichromatism

00:07:16.110 --> 00:07:18.750
is often related to the
strength of sexual selection

00:07:18.750 --> 00:07:20.790
that operates in these
cichlid lineages.

00:07:23.860 --> 00:07:27.430
And in particular, we were
interested to find both depth

00:07:27.430 --> 00:07:29.590
and sexual dichromatism
as predictors

00:07:29.590 --> 00:07:33.160
of adaptive radiation
because both of those aspects

00:07:33.160 --> 00:07:35.620
are involved in one of the
best studied mechanisms

00:07:35.620 --> 00:07:39.040
of cichlid speciation, which
is known as sensory drive

00:07:39.040 --> 00:07:40.300
speciation.

00:07:40.300 --> 00:07:43.030
This is where there's
differential adaptation

00:07:43.030 --> 00:07:47.080
along depth gradients
in lakes, where

00:07:47.080 --> 00:07:49.270
at deeper depths in a
lake the fish are living

00:07:49.270 --> 00:07:51.210
in a very different
light environment

00:07:51.210 --> 00:07:54.130
than the fish have at the
shallow part of the lake.

00:07:54.130 --> 00:07:57.520
And this drives differential
ecological adaptation and also

00:07:57.520 --> 00:08:01.490
differential sexual selection,
which leads to speciation.

00:08:01.490 --> 00:08:05.260
So finding this pattern of both
depth and sexual dichromatism

00:08:05.260 --> 00:08:08.710
at a broader scale for cichlids
suggests that this mechanism

00:08:08.710 --> 00:08:12.010
may operate across
the continent,

00:08:12.010 --> 00:08:17.020
and help us to explain cichlid
diversity more generally.

00:08:17.020 --> 00:08:19.060
We were also interested
to find energy

00:08:19.060 --> 00:08:24.160
coming out as a predictor of
cichlid adaptive radiation.

00:08:24.160 --> 00:08:27.400
And although this hadn't
ever been discussed

00:08:27.400 --> 00:08:31.060
in cichlid biology
before, we know

00:08:31.060 --> 00:08:32.799
that energy
availability would have

00:08:32.799 --> 00:08:35.980
a strong influence on
resource environment

00:08:35.980 --> 00:08:39.039
and on population abundances,
and both of those aspects

00:08:39.039 --> 00:08:41.890
we would expect to play into
the evolutionary biology

00:08:41.890 --> 00:08:42.919
of these fish.

00:08:42.919 --> 00:08:44.740
So this presents
lots more questions

00:08:44.740 --> 00:08:48.310
to ask about the relationship
between energy availability

00:08:48.310 --> 00:08:51.930
and evolution.

00:08:51.930 --> 00:08:54.590
And one thing I want to
mention before moving on

00:08:54.590 --> 00:08:57.530
is that these models are only
as good as the predictors

00:08:57.530 --> 00:08:59.120
that we can include in them.

00:08:59.120 --> 00:09:00.990
And there are certainly
other predictors

00:09:00.990 --> 00:09:04.820
which are also really important
in explaining cichlid adaptive

00:09:04.820 --> 00:09:05.870
radiation.

00:09:05.870 --> 00:09:09.260
One of those that is emerging
as incredibly important

00:09:09.260 --> 00:09:11.360
is genetic diversity
of these lineages

00:09:11.360 --> 00:09:13.280
and their history
of hybridization.

00:09:13.280 --> 00:09:16.220
And that's a subject that I'll
speak about towards the end

00:09:16.220 --> 00:09:18.710
of the talk.

00:09:18.710 --> 00:09:21.950
I also want to point out
that surface area of lakes

00:09:21.950 --> 00:09:25.100
does not predict whether
or not cichlid adaptive

00:09:25.100 --> 00:09:28.910
radiations happen, but surface
area becomes very important

00:09:28.910 --> 00:09:31.370
when thinking about predicting
the number of species

00:09:31.370 --> 00:09:33.740
that evolve within these
adaptive radiations.

00:09:36.540 --> 00:09:40.730
So that's the second part of the
talk, asking the question, what

00:09:40.730 --> 00:09:42.950
influences the number
of cichlid species

00:09:42.950 --> 00:09:45.650
that evolve in
these African lakes?

00:09:45.650 --> 00:09:48.620
So in this plot
of Africa, you can

00:09:48.620 --> 00:09:52.430
see the red dots correspond
to lakes where there has

00:09:52.430 --> 00:09:54.590
been evolution of new species.

00:09:54.590 --> 00:09:57.110
The black dots are lakes
where there has not been

00:09:57.110 --> 00:09:58.850
the evolution of new species.

00:09:58.850 --> 00:10:01.430
And the size of the dot
corresponds with the number

00:10:01.430 --> 00:10:03.110
of species in that lake.

00:10:03.110 --> 00:10:06.770
And you can see that these
lakes range in species number

00:10:06.770 --> 00:10:09.815
from many hundreds of species
down to just a few species.

00:10:13.010 --> 00:10:15.340
So we can think of the number
of species in these lakes

00:10:15.340 --> 00:10:17.120
in a couple of different ways.

00:10:17.120 --> 00:10:19.960
Some lakes, the species that
are there simply because they've

00:10:19.960 --> 00:10:20.920
colonized the lake.

00:10:20.920 --> 00:10:23.530
They've dispersed into
the lake from rivers,

00:10:23.530 --> 00:10:27.790
and so this would be a
dispersal assembled community.

00:10:27.790 --> 00:10:30.490
We have other communities
where there's been evolution

00:10:30.490 --> 00:10:32.032
of one of those colonists.

00:10:32.032 --> 00:10:34.240
And so we can think of this
as an evolution assembled

00:10:34.240 --> 00:10:35.290
community.

00:10:35.290 --> 00:10:37.450
And in these cichlids,
sometimes this evolution

00:10:37.450 --> 00:10:39.820
has happened in one
lineage, and sometimes it's

00:10:39.820 --> 00:10:42.040
happened in multiple
lineage to contribute

00:10:42.040 --> 00:10:47.060
to the number of species
that we find in that lake.

00:10:47.060 --> 00:10:50.910
If we plot the number of
lineages we find in the lake--

00:10:50.910 --> 00:10:53.210
so this is the number
of species, essentially,

00:10:53.210 --> 00:10:54.950
as a function of lake area.

00:10:54.950 --> 00:10:58.110
And this is not accounting
for the effects of evolution.

00:10:58.110 --> 00:11:00.020
So this is cutting
out all the species

00:11:00.020 --> 00:11:02.030
that have evolved in place.

00:11:02.030 --> 00:11:04.530
We see that there's a
positive relationship here.

00:11:04.530 --> 00:11:06.770
So we get more
species in the lake

00:11:06.770 --> 00:11:08.870
simply the bigger the lake is.

00:11:08.870 --> 00:11:12.990
More species colonize into it.

00:11:12.990 --> 00:11:16.260
But if we then add on
the effects of evolution,

00:11:16.260 --> 00:11:20.100
what we see is that evolution
within these lakes produces

00:11:20.100 --> 00:11:25.080
on average an order of magnitude
more species in these lakes

00:11:25.080 --> 00:11:26.880
than dispersal alone.

00:11:26.880 --> 00:11:30.480
So evolution is having a
gigantic impact on the number

00:11:30.480 --> 00:11:32.520
of species within these lakes.

00:11:32.520 --> 00:11:35.090
And additionally,
more species evolve

00:11:35.090 --> 00:11:36.780
in the very largest lakes.

00:11:36.780 --> 00:11:38.760
So we can predict
the number of species

00:11:38.760 --> 00:11:42.000
that evolve in a lake based
on the size of that lake.

00:11:44.590 --> 00:11:47.590
If we take this one
step further and ask,

00:11:47.590 --> 00:11:51.010
how does the rate at
which species evolve

00:11:51.010 --> 00:11:53.570
influence these patterns?

00:11:53.570 --> 00:11:56.020
This is a plot of
diversification rate

00:11:56.020 --> 00:11:58.000
as a function of lake area.

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:00.850
And what you can see here
is that diversification rate

00:12:00.850 --> 00:12:06.370
does not predict the number
of species in these lakes.

00:12:06.370 --> 00:12:09.010
So there is no relationship
between diversification rate

00:12:09.010 --> 00:12:11.580
and lake size.

00:12:11.580 --> 00:12:14.750
There is one clear
outlier in this plot,

00:12:14.750 --> 00:12:17.710
and that is Lake Victoria.

00:12:17.710 --> 00:12:22.900
And if we look at the plot of
species richness in lake area,

00:12:22.900 --> 00:12:25.880
and look at where Lake
Victoria is on that plot,

00:12:25.880 --> 00:12:27.700
we can see that Lake
Victoria cichlid

00:12:27.700 --> 00:12:32.110
diversity is exceptional,
because it both has

00:12:32.110 --> 00:12:35.500
an exceptionally rapid
diversification rate,

00:12:35.500 --> 00:12:38.140
and because the
lake is very large.

00:12:38.140 --> 00:12:41.320
And so that points us to
Lake Victoria as an outlier,

00:12:41.320 --> 00:12:43.750
and begs the
question, what enables

00:12:43.750 --> 00:12:46.390
this exceptionally
rapid diversification

00:12:46.390 --> 00:12:47.740
in the case of Lake Victoria?

00:12:51.210 --> 00:12:53.900
And so this question
about the exceptional rate

00:12:53.900 --> 00:12:56.570
of evolution in Lake Victoria
is actually an old one

00:12:56.570 --> 00:12:58.790
in evolutionary biology.

00:12:58.790 --> 00:13:02.600
And Lake Victoria is less
than 15,000 years old.

00:13:02.600 --> 00:13:05.270
It was dry 15,000 years ago.

00:13:05.270 --> 00:13:08.530
And it has about
450 cichlid species.

00:13:08.530 --> 00:13:10.820
And this exceptional
rate of evolution

00:13:10.820 --> 00:13:15.500
has led many people to
suggest that perhaps these

00:13:15.500 --> 00:13:17.900
aren't actually
species, perhaps it's

00:13:17.900 --> 00:13:20.330
just a hypervariable population,
and we shouldn't really

00:13:20.330 --> 00:13:23.310
consider these species.

00:13:23.310 --> 00:13:27.870
We used genomic data about five
years ago for the first time

00:13:27.870 --> 00:13:32.070
to have a really in-depth look
at these species genetically.

00:13:32.070 --> 00:13:36.450
And we find that, when we
use enough genomic data,

00:13:36.450 --> 00:13:39.540
we can very readily tell
these species apart.

00:13:39.540 --> 00:13:42.760
As you can see, each of
the species in this plot

00:13:42.760 --> 00:13:47.630
forms nice groups when we
use enough genomic data.

00:13:47.630 --> 00:13:49.620
So we really think
that these are

00:13:49.620 --> 00:13:52.035
species as we would
consider anything a species.

00:13:54.540 --> 00:13:58.000
And thanks to collaboration
with the Broad Institute,

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:02.560
we now have five fully sequenced
and annotated reference genomes

00:14:02.560 --> 00:14:06.970
that span a lot of diversity
in African cichlids.

00:14:06.970 --> 00:14:10.030
They're from many parts
of the African cichlid

00:14:10.030 --> 00:14:12.160
evolutionary tree.

00:14:12.160 --> 00:14:15.040
So using these resources
from the annotated reference

00:14:15.040 --> 00:14:17.890
genomes, we can dig
further into understanding,

00:14:17.890 --> 00:14:21.490
what are the genetic differences
between these young species,

00:14:21.490 --> 00:14:23.350
and what are the
functional consequences

00:14:23.350 --> 00:14:25.142
of those genetic differences?

00:14:27.980 --> 00:14:31.730
This relates to the-- we've been
using this genomic information

00:14:31.730 --> 00:14:35.600
to ask these questions about
the origins of exceptionally

00:14:35.600 --> 00:14:39.500
rapid species diversity
in Lake Victoria,

00:14:39.500 --> 00:14:41.670
specifically asking
the question,

00:14:41.670 --> 00:14:44.600
where did this Lake Victoria
radiation come from?

00:14:44.600 --> 00:14:48.920
And what genomic properties
facilitate this extremely rapid

00:14:48.920 --> 00:14:50.420
radiation?

00:14:50.420 --> 00:14:52.910
And the work that I'm
going to talk about now

00:14:52.910 --> 00:14:56.510
is led by Joana Meier, who
is now a postdoctoral fellow

00:14:56.510 --> 00:14:57.320
at Cambridge.

00:14:59.970 --> 00:15:02.420
So Lake Victoria
is part of a larger

00:15:02.420 --> 00:15:05.180
group of cichlids called
the Lake Victoria Region

00:15:05.180 --> 00:15:06.560
Superflock.

00:15:06.560 --> 00:15:09.380
This includes cichlid
adaptive radiations

00:15:09.380 --> 00:15:12.200
in Lake Albert, Lake
Edward, Lake Kivu, and also

00:15:12.200 --> 00:15:13.550
Lake Victoria.

00:15:13.550 --> 00:15:15.380
So all of these
radiations together

00:15:15.380 --> 00:15:19.160
form this group called the
LVRS, the Lake Victoria Region

00:15:19.160 --> 00:15:20.300
Superflock.

00:15:20.300 --> 00:15:23.150
And this comprises
about 700 species

00:15:23.150 --> 00:15:26.360
that have evolved in
the past 150,000 years.

00:15:26.360 --> 00:15:29.810
So the origins of this
group coincide roughly

00:15:29.810 --> 00:15:33.680
with when modern humans
were leaving Africa,

00:15:33.680 --> 00:15:35.420
to connect back to
our earlier talks.

00:15:38.930 --> 00:15:40.700
So when we look at
the genomic data

00:15:40.700 --> 00:15:42.950
from the Lake Victoria
Region Superflock,

00:15:42.950 --> 00:15:45.980
using methods from
human genetics,

00:15:45.980 --> 00:15:49.190
we infer that there was a
hybridization event between two

00:15:49.190 --> 00:15:52.310
divergent lineages which
subsequently led to the Lake

00:15:52.310 --> 00:15:54.380
Victoria Region Superflock.

00:15:54.380 --> 00:15:59.810
And that hybridization event was
between the Congolese lineage,

00:15:59.810 --> 00:16:02.180
whose distribution is
shown in red on the map

00:16:02.180 --> 00:16:06.170
here, and an Upper Nile
lineage, whose distribution is

00:16:06.170 --> 00:16:08.940
shown in this map in blue.

00:16:08.940 --> 00:16:12.290
So these two lineages were at
least a million years divergent

00:16:12.290 --> 00:16:13.730
from each other.

00:16:13.730 --> 00:16:16.970
They encountered each other
in the Lake Victoria region,

00:16:16.970 --> 00:16:20.120
and subsequently, all of
these adaptive radiations

00:16:20.120 --> 00:16:25.040
in these different lakes in the
Lake Victoria region emerged.

00:16:25.040 --> 00:16:29.930
So the question then becomes,
was this just a happenstance

00:16:29.930 --> 00:16:32.630
event in their
history, or did it

00:16:32.630 --> 00:16:34.730
have functional consequences?

00:16:34.730 --> 00:16:36.440
Is there a functional
consequence

00:16:36.440 --> 00:16:39.590
to this admixture in the same
way that we can ask questions

00:16:39.590 --> 00:16:41.030
about the functional
consequences

00:16:41.030 --> 00:16:46.280
of Neanderthal admixture
in human history?

00:16:46.280 --> 00:16:50.930
And so one piece of
evidence pointing

00:16:50.930 --> 00:16:54.980
to functional significance
of this hybridization event

00:16:54.980 --> 00:16:58.060
comes from the LWS opsin gene.

00:16:58.060 --> 00:17:01.010
LWS opsin is long
wavelength sensitive opsin.

00:17:01.010 --> 00:17:05.240
So this gene is involved
in visual acuity

00:17:05.240 --> 00:17:07.310
in different lighting
environments,

00:17:07.310 --> 00:17:10.319
where one variant of the gene--

00:17:10.319 --> 00:17:14.540
so this is the gene's diversity
in cichlids from the Lake

00:17:14.540 --> 00:17:17.190
Victoria Region Superflock.

00:17:17.190 --> 00:17:20.240
And we find, in some
species, a version

00:17:20.240 --> 00:17:23.869
of the gene which gives
visual acuity in clear water

00:17:23.869 --> 00:17:25.970
over rocky substrates.

00:17:25.970 --> 00:17:29.410
And in other species in the
Lake Victoria Region Superflock,

00:17:29.410 --> 00:17:33.230
a version of the gene which
provides visual acuity in murky

00:17:33.230 --> 00:17:36.450
water and muddy substrates.

00:17:36.450 --> 00:17:40.470
And so these different
versions of the LWS opsin gene

00:17:40.470 --> 00:17:43.470
have been repeatedly
used for adaptation

00:17:43.470 --> 00:17:45.400
to these different
light environments.

00:17:47.980 --> 00:17:50.560
When we look at the
versions of the gene

00:17:50.560 --> 00:17:54.320
present in the Congolese lineage
and in the Upper Nile lineage,

00:17:54.320 --> 00:17:57.670
we see that all of the
Congolese lineage species

00:17:57.670 --> 00:18:01.600
have the clear water
variant of the gene,

00:18:01.600 --> 00:18:03.880
and all of the Upper
Nile lineage fish

00:18:03.880 --> 00:18:07.280
have the muddy water
variant of the gene.

00:18:07.280 --> 00:18:10.030
And so this suggests that the
reason that we find these two

00:18:10.030 --> 00:18:12.790
variants of the gene together
in the Lake Victoria Region

00:18:12.790 --> 00:18:16.180
Superflock is because of
this history of admixture

00:18:16.180 --> 00:18:18.620
between the lineages.

00:18:18.620 --> 00:18:20.620
So this lends
evidence to the idea

00:18:20.620 --> 00:18:23.020
that this ancient
hybridization event

00:18:23.020 --> 00:18:25.900
provided functional
genetic variation, which

00:18:25.900 --> 00:18:28.120
was subsequently
used for adaptation

00:18:28.120 --> 00:18:30.310
within these
adaptive radiations,

00:18:30.310 --> 00:18:33.261
and facilitated the rapidity
at which these radiations could

00:18:33.261 --> 00:18:33.760
happen.

00:18:36.400 --> 00:18:39.960
So in summary, we think that
hybridization facilitates

00:18:39.960 --> 00:18:44.700
cichlid evolution by providing
functional genetic variation

00:18:44.700 --> 00:18:48.780
and enabling extremely
rapid adaptive radiation.

00:18:48.780 --> 00:18:52.230
And we also think that these
kinds of hybridization events

00:18:52.230 --> 00:18:55.800
may be quite pervasive in
cichlid evolutionary history,

00:18:55.800 --> 00:19:01.140
and help to explain
rapid adaptive radiation

00:19:01.140 --> 00:19:04.770
many times over.

00:19:04.770 --> 00:19:07.220
So in summary, the take-home
points from my talk

00:19:07.220 --> 00:19:09.950
are, first of all, that we
need to consider interactions

00:19:09.950 --> 00:19:13.790
between intrinsic factors
and extrinsic factors

00:19:13.790 --> 00:19:17.600
in predicting when
adaptive radiations happen.

00:19:17.600 --> 00:19:19.940
Second, that lake area
predicts the number

00:19:19.940 --> 00:19:23.110
of species that evolve
in African lakes,

00:19:23.110 --> 00:19:24.740
and that that's
somewhat disconnected

00:19:24.740 --> 00:19:28.460
from the diversification
rates in these lakes.

00:19:28.460 --> 00:19:29.960
And third, that
hybridization may

00:19:29.960 --> 00:19:32.960
be key in understanding
the exceptionally

00:19:32.960 --> 00:19:38.090
rapid adaptive radiations
in African cichlids.

00:19:38.090 --> 00:19:41.060
And with that, I'd like to thank
my collaborators and funders,

00:19:41.060 --> 00:19:43.140
and I'd be happy to
take some questions.

00:19:43.140 --> 00:19:45.048
[APPLAUSE]

00:19:51.260 --> 00:19:53.210
- Thank you, Katie.

00:19:53.210 --> 00:19:54.020
We have a question.

00:19:57.400 --> 00:20:07.000
- What about a cichlid, compared
to other types of species,

00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:11.680
makes it so good at
diversifying and adapting?

00:20:11.680 --> 00:20:12.760
- Yeah.

00:20:12.760 --> 00:20:14.500
That's a fantastic question.

00:20:14.500 --> 00:20:18.070
And it's why so many of us
keep on studying cichlids,

00:20:18.070 --> 00:20:19.720
because they're so exceptional.

00:20:19.720 --> 00:20:22.960
If you look at other fish groups
in these lakes, some of them

00:20:22.960 --> 00:20:25.460
have evolved a few
species here and there,

00:20:25.460 --> 00:20:27.190
but nothing like
cichlids, nothing

00:20:27.190 --> 00:20:30.550
like the hundreds of species
that we see in these lakes.

00:20:30.550 --> 00:20:31.960
I don't think
there's one answer.

00:20:31.960 --> 00:20:34.900
I think that there are
a number of features

00:20:34.900 --> 00:20:38.650
of cichlids which facilitate
their rapid evolution.

00:20:38.650 --> 00:20:41.890
But we would like to think
that some of these things

00:20:41.890 --> 00:20:43.840
that I talked about--

00:20:43.840 --> 00:20:46.390
propensity towards
sexual selection,

00:20:46.390 --> 00:20:49.150
propensity of hybridization
events, and sharing

00:20:49.150 --> 00:20:53.050
of these genetic variants
across divergent groups--

00:20:53.050 --> 00:20:58.060
are some of the reasons why they
evolved so rapidly and so many

00:20:58.060 --> 00:20:59.530
species.

00:20:59.530 --> 00:21:00.340
- Thanks very much.

00:21:03.150 --> 00:21:05.370
- Heather Remoff.

00:21:05.370 --> 00:21:12.270
I'm wondering how the
species, the factors that

00:21:12.270 --> 00:21:15.510
maintain species
integrity, are they

00:21:15.510 --> 00:21:17.970
largely behavioral or genetic?

00:21:21.140 --> 00:21:26.060
- Many of the features that
maintain species integrity

00:21:26.060 --> 00:21:27.300
are behavioral.

00:21:27.300 --> 00:21:29.360
So they're what we
would call prezygotic.

00:21:29.360 --> 00:21:31.680
They're mate-choice decisions.

00:21:31.680 --> 00:21:35.960
And so that's how hybridization
can happen very readily.

00:21:35.960 --> 00:21:40.520
That's not to say that those
behavioral differences don't

00:21:40.520 --> 00:21:42.720
have a genetic basis also.

00:21:42.720 --> 00:21:43.720
- Alyssa?

00:21:43.720 --> 00:21:45.860
- I am Alyssa Goodman
from here at Radcliffe,

00:21:45.860 --> 00:21:50.810
and I was really admiring
your beautiful images of all

00:21:50.810 --> 00:21:53.180
the fish, and it made
me wonder whether or not

00:21:53.180 --> 00:21:56.450
there's a good correlation
between the genetic differences

00:21:56.450 --> 00:21:58.260
and the actual
appearance of the fish.

00:21:58.260 --> 00:22:00.920
Do the fish know that each
other are different species,

00:22:00.920 --> 00:22:03.440
and can they even see
the colors of the fish?

00:22:03.440 --> 00:22:05.090
- Yeah.

00:22:05.090 --> 00:22:07.490
That's a great
question, and I wish

00:22:07.490 --> 00:22:11.030
it was easier to ask every one
of those species this question.

00:22:14.720 --> 00:22:17.180
So the mate-choice
decisions, as I've just said,

00:22:17.180 --> 00:22:21.440
are a really crucial thing for
maintaining species boundaries

00:22:21.440 --> 00:22:23.120
in many, many cases.

00:22:23.120 --> 00:22:25.400
And so we know at
least in those cases

00:22:25.400 --> 00:22:27.260
that they can tell
each other apart,

00:22:27.260 --> 00:22:31.130
and that's very important for
the maintenance of diversity.

00:22:31.130 --> 00:22:33.511
Yeah.

00:22:33.511 --> 00:22:34.010
- Yes?

00:22:34.010 --> 00:22:35.593
- I was just wondering
what is known--

00:22:35.593 --> 00:22:37.730
this is Tim
[INAUDIBLE] from MIT.

00:22:37.730 --> 00:22:39.980
Just wondering what is
known about horizontal gene

00:22:39.980 --> 00:22:42.620
transfer in cichlids.

00:22:42.620 --> 00:22:48.050
- Yeah, so in the case of
sexually reproducing organisms

00:22:48.050 --> 00:22:49.760
like this, we think
of hybridization

00:22:49.760 --> 00:22:51.740
as horizontal gene transfer.

00:22:51.740 --> 00:22:52.880
That's our analog.

00:22:52.880 --> 00:22:53.380
Yeah.

00:22:57.110 --> 00:22:58.490
- We have two more minutes.

00:22:58.490 --> 00:22:59.380
I have a question.

00:22:59.380 --> 00:23:03.830
So you mentioned the energy
impacts the diversity.

00:23:03.830 --> 00:23:05.950
Is that the same as temperature?

00:23:05.950 --> 00:23:07.230
- It's not temperature.

00:23:07.230 --> 00:23:11.190
So the proxy that we used was
solar radiation to these lakes,

00:23:11.190 --> 00:23:13.220
which you would think
would have a direct impact

00:23:13.220 --> 00:23:18.080
on productivity, so primary
productivity in these systems.

00:23:18.080 --> 00:23:21.210
It would be fascinating
to have a global

00:23:21.210 --> 00:23:24.740
or a continent-wide data set
on productivity instead of just

00:23:24.740 --> 00:23:27.290
using solar
radiation as a proxy,

00:23:27.290 --> 00:23:29.720
because there's all kinds
of complex limnology

00:23:29.720 --> 00:23:33.340
that translates solar
radiation into the resource

00:23:33.340 --> 00:23:34.340
base for these lakes.

00:23:37.400 --> 00:23:40.440
- Is there information
on temperature?

00:23:40.440 --> 00:23:41.530
- There is not--

00:23:41.530 --> 00:23:44.990
we don't have information on
temperature in our system.

00:23:44.990 --> 00:23:47.120
Again, that's another
thing that would

00:23:47.120 --> 00:23:50.490
be great to have
for all these lakes.

00:23:50.490 --> 00:23:51.770
- Right.

00:23:51.770 --> 00:23:53.520
Well, that was fantastic.

00:23:53.520 --> 00:23:55.670
And now we have
our last speaker.

00:23:55.670 --> 00:23:56.630
Thank you, Katie.

00:23:56.630 --> 00:23:57.830
[APPLAUSE]

00:23:58.430 --> 00:24:00.880
