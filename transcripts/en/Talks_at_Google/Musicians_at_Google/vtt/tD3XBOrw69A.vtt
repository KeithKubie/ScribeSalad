RYAN LOREN: Hello, Margo.

00:00:03.010 --> 00:00:04.065
MARGOT B: Hi, Ryan.

00:00:04.065 --> 00:00:05.909
RYAN LOREN: Thanks for
being here tonight.

00:00:05.909 --> 00:00:07.200
I'm really excited to have you.

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:07.970
MARGOT B: Thanks for having me.

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:09.140
This is fun to be at Google.

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:10.700
RYAN LOREN: Yeah, totally.

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:13.260
So I just wanted to
talk to you a little bit

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:15.970
about your background and a
little bit about your music.

00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:17.095
And then we'll get started.

00:00:17.095 --> 00:00:19.700
So can you tell people
about you that might not

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:22.470
know who you are about your
music, your background?

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:23.370
MARGOT B: Sure.

00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:25.690
I grew up in Pittsburgh,
Pennsylvania.

00:00:25.690 --> 00:00:27.980
I come from a very
eclectic family.

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:31.170
My mother, who is
Russian-German, and my father,

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:34.690
originally from Jamaica and
moved to the United States

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:35.570
when he was 16.

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:36.980
So he has an interesting story.

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:39.970
And then they met in college
and produced me, which is great.

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:42.485
I'm thankful.

00:00:42.485 --> 00:00:44.680
And I've lived in New
York for five years,

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:46.870
working independently
as a singer-songwriter

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:50.360
and working as a songwriter
for other artists

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:52.090
and touring with other artists.

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:54.290
I just finished
"Rent" off Broadway.

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:56.410
It just closed in September.

00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:59.480
And doing other shows in
the meantime but getting

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:00.270
back to my music.

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:00.875
So it's exciting.

00:01:00.875 --> 00:01:01.590
RYAN LOREN: Cool.

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:04.150
If you could quickly summarize
your experience with "Rent,"

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:07.195
how would you say that,
or what would you say?

00:01:07.195 --> 00:01:08.810
MARGOT B: Life changing.

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:11.350
It was something that
I will always remember.

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:16.390
And I never expected it to
be so hard to say goodbye.

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:18.900
But that family is
such a huge family.

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:22.490
"Rent" was such an
unbelievable show that totally

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:27.210
changed the face of musical
theater for rock and everything

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:29.770
and changing the
way that it's sung

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:32.970
and the way that it
just looks to everyone.

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:35.390
And as a kid, I grew
up with that show.

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:37.774
So it's kind of weird to
be doing book reports when

00:01:37.774 --> 00:01:39.440
you were younger and
then be in the show

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:42.710
and sitting with the director
and the writer's father

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:45.590
and being invited over
to family dinners.

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:47.570
And it was life changing.

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:48.590
RYAN LOREN: Cool.

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:50.365
I was lucky enough
to get to see you.

00:01:50.365 --> 00:01:50.990
MARGOT B: Yeah.

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:53.460
We had a lot of fun
jumping around and swinging

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:55.040
from the rafters.

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:56.570
RYAN LOREN: You did very well.

00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:58.067
It was pretty good.

00:01:58.067 --> 00:02:00.400
So let me ask you a little
bit about Black History Month

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:01.750
and what it means to you.

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:03.610
We're here to
celebrate that tonight.

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:06.792
So just a little bit, maybe
more, about your heritage

00:02:06.792 --> 00:02:08.500
and how you've celebrated
over the years.

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:11.170
I heard you wrote a tribute
to Martin Luther King

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:12.075
when you were 13--

00:02:12.075 --> 00:02:12.920
MARGOT B: I did.

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:14.660
RYAN LOREN: --that
still is relevant.

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:17.570
So I think it's really cool
that you're here tonight.

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:19.800
MARGOT B: It was
really funny-- just

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:22.550
to touch on that
story a little bit.

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:25.630
My mother and I were
driving to Philadelphia

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:30.620
for a beauty pageant,
because I really

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:32.039
wanted to be a
part of everything

00:02:32.039 --> 00:02:34.080
that they were a part of,
because they were doing

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:36.240
a lot of fund raising and
a lot of volunteer work.

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:38.190
And I thought, that's awesome.

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:40.180
I get to do that all the time?

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:41.440
That sounds like a great idea.

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:42.790
I want to win this thing.

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:45.140
So I went to Philly with my mom.

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:47.130
And when we were in the
car, I just got bored.

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:49.980
And I used to write poems and
songs every once in a while.

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:54.380
But she suggested that
we just write a song.

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:58.640
And she asked me,
what's really important?

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:00.390
And it happened to be
Black History Month.

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:01.931
And I was like, why
don't we write it

00:03:01.931 --> 00:03:04.430
about Dr. Martin
Luther King, Jr.?

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:06.810
And she was like, that
sounds like a great idea.

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:09.880
So we sat down-- well,
obviously, she was driving.

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:12.960
But I sat down and just tried
to brainstorm a little bit.

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:16.360
And she helped me think
and figure out my thoughts

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:19.480
and process it and
put it into song form.

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:22.200
And now it's played in
every state in the US

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:24.060
on his birthday, which
is really exciting.

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:25.560
And we did a whole video.

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:27.270
And I incorporated
my high school.

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:30.090
And we got out
for the day, which

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:34.760
was really cool as a kid to
play hooky for a day in school

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:36.190
and shoot my music video.

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:38.610
And then that played
along with the song.

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:41.459
And that gave me a
little bit of acclaim.

00:03:41.459 --> 00:03:43.000
But it was all for
the right reasons.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.660
And it was just because
it meant a lot to me.

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:51.240
And coming from such an eclectic
background with my ethnicity

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:55.390
and my family and
religion and everything,

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:58.870
it was just really important
to me to put out that message

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:01.650
and know that it's
still really relevant.

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:05.220
Though it doesn't seem like
things are so restricted now,

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:06.700
we've come very far.

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:09.750
But I think that we still
have many, many moons

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:14.620
to go before the face
of color is extinct.

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:16.850
But it was really
exciting for me

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:20.131
to add to a little piece of
the puzzle as best as I could.

00:04:20.131 --> 00:04:20.839
RYAN LOREN: Yeah.

00:04:20.839 --> 00:04:22.330
No, I think that's incredible.

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:23.704
It's really commendable.

00:04:23.704 --> 00:04:25.120
I know when I was
playing hooky, I

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:28.284
was shooting monsters
on video games.

00:04:28.284 --> 00:04:30.450
MARGOT B: I might have done
that on the side, maybe.

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:34.180
RYAN LOREN: So I think it's
really good to have you

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:38.190
because your background
is so different.

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:41.960
And you appreciate
Black History Month.

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:43.225
And also, you give back.

00:04:43.225 --> 00:04:44.600
And I wanted to
talk a little bit

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:47.810
about you've volunteered a lot.

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:50.422
And you did a lot for
Katrina in Pittsburgh.

00:04:50.422 --> 00:04:52.130
And I just wanted to
see what you've done

00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:53.213
and what you're doing now.

00:04:53.213 --> 00:04:54.820
MARGOT B: Yeah.

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:56.810
Volunteering has just
always been something

00:04:56.810 --> 00:05:01.280
that my heart is drawn to.

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:03.620
We did a Katrina
benefit concert in one

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:07.030
of the biggest arenas in
Pittsburgh, which granted me

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:09.000
a key to the city from
the mayor of Pittsburgh,

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:10.440
which was really cool.

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:12.140
And I was 15.

00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:13.330
So that was really nice.

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:15.540
The Red Cross collabed with us.

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:18.525
And my mom and dad and brother
helped me put it together.

00:05:18.525 --> 00:05:19.650
And it was really exciting.

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:22.900
We had huge names put it
all together in Pittsburgh.

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:24.686
And we had thousands
of people there.

00:05:24.686 --> 00:05:25.185
It was huge.

00:05:25.185 --> 00:05:28.952
And we raised a lot of
money for the benefit.

00:05:28.952 --> 00:05:30.910
Since I was in "Rent,"
I've had the opportunity

00:05:30.910 --> 00:05:33.690
to collab with
Friends In Deed, which

00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:36.030
was what "Rent" was
based off of and written,

00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:38.710
because of the support
groups dealing with AIDS.

00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:44.070
And I dealt a lot with their
main headquarters out of SoHo.

00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:47.205
And it was actually
around the same time

00:05:47.205 --> 00:05:48.330
that my grandmother passed.

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:51.570
So it was really near
and dear to my heart.

00:05:51.570 --> 00:05:53.440
And now, they've
opened up their doors

00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:58.060
to not only AIDS survivors or
people that have lost friends

00:05:58.060 --> 00:06:00.430
and/or family with
the AIDS virus

00:06:00.430 --> 00:06:05.640
but to also cancer survivors
and people that were lost.

00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:07.960
So I had the
opportunity to do that.

00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:10.810
And I do the AIDS
walk every year.

00:06:10.810 --> 00:06:13.090
And I just started
with City Harvest,

00:06:13.090 --> 00:06:15.610
which is a great
organization out of Brooklyn.

00:06:15.610 --> 00:06:16.680
It's a bit of a trek.

00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:17.980
But it's really worth it.

00:06:17.980 --> 00:06:19.890
We recently were there.

00:06:19.890 --> 00:06:22.140
Because of the theater and
Broadway community as well,

00:06:22.140 --> 00:06:23.920
I was invited,
which was amazing.

00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:26.340
I've had a lot of
great experiences.

00:06:26.340 --> 00:06:34.470
We packed patches of potatoes
and oranges and pears.

00:06:34.470 --> 00:06:37.080
And then they go out
to families in need.

00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:38.920
And we packed over a ton.

00:06:38.920 --> 00:06:45.050
So each sack full of pear or
whatever it is feeds a family.

00:06:45.050 --> 00:06:47.450
So that was really
nice to know that we

00:06:47.450 --> 00:06:51.540
fed over a couple hundred
families within a couple hours.

00:06:51.540 --> 00:06:53.580
And it was fun and exciting.

00:06:53.580 --> 00:06:56.080
And I just had the
opportunity to be invited

00:06:56.080 --> 00:07:00.740
to a Women Who Cares event
hosted by Loreen Arbus.

00:07:00.740 --> 00:07:03.850
And it is based off of
the UCP Foundation, which

00:07:03.850 --> 00:07:05.695
is the United Cerebral
Palsy Foundation.

00:07:05.695 --> 00:07:08.070
So I'm excited to get
on board with them.

00:07:08.070 --> 00:07:11.670
But all of these organizations
are really important to me.

00:07:11.670 --> 00:07:13.672
So I'm just trying
to find new ones.

00:07:13.672 --> 00:07:14.380
RYAN LOREN: Yeah.

00:07:14.380 --> 00:07:16.404
No, you're staying
connected and getting

00:07:16.404 --> 00:07:17.570
involved with the community.

00:07:17.570 --> 00:07:17.920
I think that's great.

00:07:17.920 --> 00:07:18.140
MARGOT B: Yeah.

00:07:18.140 --> 00:07:19.940
You've got to get involved
or else nothing changes.

00:07:19.940 --> 00:07:20.700
RYAN LOREN: Cool.

00:07:20.700 --> 00:07:21.960
So let's switch
gears a little bit.

00:07:21.960 --> 00:07:22.680
Talk about music.

00:07:22.680 --> 00:07:23.750
What's next for you?

00:07:23.750 --> 00:07:27.330
And then we'll get going.

00:07:27.330 --> 00:07:32.010
MARGOT B: Well, I'm pumped to
get back on the music train.

00:07:32.010 --> 00:07:33.780
I've been writing
a lot and collabing

00:07:33.780 --> 00:07:35.740
with a lot of different
producers and writers

00:07:35.740 --> 00:07:37.880
and musicians and
just trying to open

00:07:37.880 --> 00:07:42.230
my mind to as many
possibilities as I possibly can.

00:07:42.230 --> 00:07:45.620
I've come across a
lot of talented people

00:07:45.620 --> 00:07:47.770
within my short
term of a career.

00:07:47.770 --> 00:07:50.630
And I just keep opening
more and more doors.

00:07:50.630 --> 00:07:52.130
And I don't know
how it's happening.

00:07:52.130 --> 00:07:53.590
But I'm really blessed.

00:07:53.590 --> 00:07:56.540
And so I'm back in
the studio writing

00:07:56.540 --> 00:07:58.940
and, hopefully, busting
out some new stuff.

00:07:58.940 --> 00:08:00.940
And you can definitely
check me around the city,

00:08:00.940 --> 00:08:03.200
because I'm booking shows
everywhere around the city

00:08:03.200 --> 00:08:03.990
right now.

00:08:03.990 --> 00:08:06.120
And I just can't
wait to get back

00:08:06.120 --> 00:08:09.200
on stage just with my
group and do my thing.

00:08:09.200 --> 00:08:10.930
And I hope people like it.

00:08:10.930 --> 00:08:11.850
RYAN LOREN: Cool.

00:08:11.850 --> 00:08:12.980
Well, I'm sure they will.

00:08:12.980 --> 00:08:16.732
Margot-- if anyone could
do anything, it's Margot.

00:08:16.732 --> 00:08:18.690
She puts her mind to
something, and it happens.

00:08:18.690 --> 00:08:19.483
So thanks for being here.

00:08:19.483 --> 00:08:19.886
MARGOT B: Thank you.

00:08:19.886 --> 00:08:20.290
That's very nice.

00:08:20.290 --> 00:08:21.790
RYAN LOREN: We're really looking
forward to having you here.

00:08:21.790 --> 00:08:22.980
And good luck with everything.

00:08:22.980 --> 00:08:23.813
MARGOT B: Thank you.

00:08:23.813 --> 00:08:25.480
RYAN LOREN: All right.
