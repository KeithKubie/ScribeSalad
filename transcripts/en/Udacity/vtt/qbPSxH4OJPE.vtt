00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:04.694
Check all of the following that require global illumination. Light through

00:00:04.694 --> 00:00:09.850
stained glass hitting the floor. A Lambertian material such as Spectralon.

00:00:09.850 --> 00:00:14.424
Patterns of light at the bottom of the swimming pool. A surface evaluated using

00:00:14.424 --> 00:00:18.839
the Blinn-Phong illumination model. Ultimately, all materials can be globally

00:00:18.839 --> 00:00:22.750
illuminated. What I'm looking for here are those situations where global

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:26.567
illumination techniques are required. Oh, and what's Spectralon? See the

00:00:26.567 --> 00:00:30.140
additional course material if you want to know about this material. Though it's

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:31.590
really not all that important.
