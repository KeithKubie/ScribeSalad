00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:15.280
[GROAN]

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:17.400
Fox and the Hound 2.

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:18.580
Here we go.

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:21.880
This is yet ANOTHER film that you think of when you think,

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:24.920
"OOH! Crappy Direct-To-DVD Disney Sequel!"

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:29.100
Once again, going back to my original Disneycember review of "The Fox and the Hound,"

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:30.800
I thought it was...good.

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:34.260
You know, not great, but it had some substance there.

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.900
It was kinda cutesy, but in the same way Bambi was cutesy,

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:37.940
and it needed to be,

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:41.520
and it kinda tricks kids into thinking it's a light and fluffy story

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:44.700
when suddenly, "WHOA!" It's like a really heavy and dark story.

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:48.100
But, unlike Bambi II, that actually tried to keep that same spirit,

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:52.660
Fox and the Hound 2 is just an obvious cash-in that doesn't try at all.

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:55.580
...well, for the most part. Some of the animation is nice, but...

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:57.740
...yeeeaaah, that's about it.

00:00:57.740 --> 00:01:01.580
Todd and Copper suddenly see that the CG Circus is in town!

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:02.860
Why is it CG?

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:07.500
There's no reason, it's just a little cheaper and, yeah, that's just kinda how this movie works.

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.380
Copper sees that there's a band called "The Singing Strays,"

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.460
and he decides he wants to join!

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:15.580
So he tries to sing, and they say "Hey, you have a good voice,"

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:17.440
"And seeing how our other singer just left,"

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:19.040
"You can join our band!"

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:22.480
But, the other singer doesn't like that she was replaced so quickly,

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:26.080
so she joins up with Todd, who wants to get his best friend back, and says,

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:28.800
"Hey, why don't we try to SABOTAGE them?"

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:31.920
So, she shows that Copper is NOT really a stray.

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:32.640
[le GASP!]

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:35.360
And suddenly, everything is thrown AWOL

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:38.120
and they'll never be able to sing in the Grand Opry

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:41.500
and- Yeah, what the hell does this have to do with the original?!

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:43.860
I'm not gonna act like the original was a classic,

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:47.100
But...BY GOD! It had SOME weight to it!

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:48.300
It was about prejudice!

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:50.660
It was about seeing past hatred!

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:56.000
It was about trying to care for your fellow man told through this story with a dog and a fox!

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.500
Yeah, I know that it sounds crazy, but it's because they really tried!

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:02.820
They tried to work with the medium they had and the story they had,

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:05.960
and they produced something that was actually kinda decent!

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:07.100
This is crap!

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:09.300
This is nicely animated-

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:11.380
Actually TOO well animated-

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:15.500
Much better than the original, so it's kinda distracting how well animated it is-

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:16.340
CRAP!

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:18.260
It's just a knock-off!

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:20.640
A knock-off that's not really trying!

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:23.520
I mean, even the idea, "Fox and the Hound 2,"

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:27.420
Unlike Bambi II, where there was this large gap that could be filled in,

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:30.460
and could be interesting, Bambi with his father,

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:32.920
what the hell can you do with Fox and the Hound 2?

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:34.800
I mean, yeah, there is this gap, but...

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:36.820
WHAT'S THERE TO FILL IN?!

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:39.800
Really nothing! The two main characters are separated!

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:42.140
So there's nothing that fascinating you could put in there,

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:46.280
and even if there was something fascinating to put in there, this team wouldn't put it in,

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:47.680
because IT DOESN'T CARE!

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:51.480
Okay, that's mean, I shouldn't say that - IT ACTS LIKE IT DOESN'T CARE!

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:56.360
What we get as a final product just feels like this cheap corporate shell!

00:02:56.360 --> 00:03:00.000
If your kids like really bouncy imagery

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.440
and some music and just kinda pretty-ish animation,

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:06.640
I mean, it's not really phenomenal, but it's...

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:09.760
...better than average, which again, kinda makes me feel bad,

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:12.340
because why are we putting this good animation to THIS?!

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:16.820
This crappy story- This is the Mulan II of Fox and the Hound sequels!

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:19.120
I know there's only one Fox and the Hound sequel, but...

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:21.000
Yeah! You can see where I'm going with this comparison!

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.640
It's Mulan II all over again, except with Fox and the Hound!

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:27.820
It's this really decent, but somehow misguided,

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:31.060
animation that's not given the proper direction.

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:33.320
There's not any investment in the characters!

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:36.340
Honestly, there's almost no reason to call it "Fox and the Hound!"

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:38.500
This could be "Any Characters!"

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:42.360
Any characters could come across this group of singing strays!

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:45.640
Actually, why is it even a Singing Stray thing?

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:47.220
Like, the crowd is watching, saying,

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:49.760
"Wow! It almost sounds like those dogs are really singing!"

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:51.280
BUT THEY ARE REALLY SINGING!

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:52.340
That's really distracting!

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:54.100
Wouldn't, like, the owner be like,

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:55.460
"HOLY FUCKING SHIT!

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:58.460
I have singing dogs, I have to do something with this, but..."

00:03:58.460 --> 00:03:59.180
NO!

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:01.060
Does he think it's a record?

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:03.420
But they're really singing- IT MAKES NO SENSE!

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:07.500
And I don't usually think about this, but they try to explain it and THEY SUCK AT IT!

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:09.660
Like everything in this movie SUCKS!

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:10.160
[Sigh}

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:12.360
I was trying to think if there was anything...

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:14.820
Anything in this film that was redeemable,

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:18.000
and I guess I thought of one and a half things.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:19.660
One is the animation.

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:21.880
Yeah, it is...decent.

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:24.180
The one full scene that I legitimately like

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:29.140
is when the owner of Copper and the owner of Todd are both looking for their pets.

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:30.840
Now, these two don't like each other,

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:35.320
but they cross paths, and they legitimately wish that the other find their pets.

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:36.680
That's a nice scene.

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:40.340
That's something that actually would've been nice to see in the original.

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:42.860
That's heartwarming, it's kinda decent.

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:44.940
Aside from that, it's fluff.

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:47.280
It's pure, 100% fluff.

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:49.520
And, don't get me wrong - if this movie just...

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:50.700
...wanted to be fluff,

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:52.640
if it wanted to be something on its own and just

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:56.520
say, "Hey, here's something for two-year-olds like Baby Einsteins,"

00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:58.400
"Except without the education,"

00:04:58.400 --> 00:04:59.280
That'd be fine!

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:00.160
But it's not!

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:02.500
It's "The Fox and the Hound 2,"

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:04.080
and when you have that title,

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:08.120
you have to have something that at least is trying to represent the original.

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:09.880
And this one isn't trying.

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:13.640
It has no interest in being the original Fox and the Hound.

00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:18.120
It just wants to make some fast money, look kinda cute and then disappear,

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:19.140
well, you know what?

00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:19.860
You did it!

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:23.380
You made some fast money, you looked cute and you disappeared!

00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:25.060
Whoop-de-frigging-do!

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:26.900
I guess I can give it credit that,

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:28.000
just like Mulan II,

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:32.320
it made me appreciate much more what a good film the original was.

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:35.520
NOW I appreciate what it was doing and

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:39.420
what a great work of prejudice-destroying art it was.

00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:45.000
Or, maybe this one was just SO bad that I suddenly think it's a masterpiece in comparison.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.880
But, either way, I guess SOME good is coming out of it!

00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:52.360
I'm seeing some more benefit out of the original Fox and the Hound than I did before!

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:57.180
But if you want me to legitimately say Fox and the Hound 2 has something good to offer,

00:05:57.180 --> 00:05:59.080
I say, "...woof."
