1
00:00:01.230 --> 00:00:02.140
Okay.
Uh,

2
00:00:02.350 --> 00:00:07.350
at the end last time we were looking at how you could possibly know the heat of

3
00:00:07.801 --> 00:00:09.540
atomization of graphite,

4
00:00:09.541 --> 00:00:14.280
how much energy it takes to put a carbon atom into the gas phase from graphite.

5
00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:16.140
Why would you want to know that?

6
00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:21.810
Why is that a key value for what purpose?

7
00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:30.300
If you want to be able to know whether you can add together bonds and get the

8
00:00:30.301 --> 00:00:34.830
energy of a molecule,
that means you start with separated Adams

9
00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:40.140
and you then see how much energy is given off when those come together to give a

10
00:00:40.141 --> 00:00:42.630
particular molecule to make a whole bunch of bonds.

11
00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:48.640
Right now you can measure that the energy of a molecule with respect to CO2

12
00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:53.490
quite easily.
How do you do that?

13
00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:58.650
Burn it and you can measure the co two relative to graphite.

14
00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:00.120
How do you do that?

15
00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:06.420
How do you know the energy of a carbon in the energy of co two relative to the

16
00:01:06.421 --> 00:01:11.220
energy of graphite plus oxygen
burn graphite.

17
00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:16.830
Okay,
but the last thing you need is the energy of graphite relative to the Adam.

18
00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:18.930
And if you then knew that,

19
00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:24.210
then you could complete this scheme and know just by burning things,

20
00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:28.410
whether you can add together bond energies to get the energy of a molecule.

21
00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:32.820
Okay,
so how do you get the energy from graphite to an atom?

22
00:01:32.821 --> 00:01:37.230
One way is spectroscopy,
and we talked about that last time,
that if you,

23
00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:42.560
if you see what the minimum amount of energy you can put into co two and have it

24
00:01:44.881 --> 00:01:49.590
break into two Adams,
that gives you the energy of the two atoms relative to CO2.

25
00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:52.920
Pardon me,
relative to see,
oh,
I should be saying right.

26
00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:56.880
And then you burn CEO and get it relative to co two and then you have everything

27
00:01:56.881 --> 00:02:00.870
you need.
Okay.
Okay.

28
00:02:00.871 --> 00:02:05.580
Except the people who were very smart,
Nobel prize winners and so on,

29
00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:10.770
deferred on interpreting this because some of them thought that when you break

30
00:02:10.771 --> 00:02:13.320
CO2 into Adams with the light,

31
00:02:13.321 --> 00:02:16.560
the atom you get is not the lowest energy state of the atom,

32
00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:18.840
but a higher energy state of the atom.

33
00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:24.500
So some of the energy you're putting in is going into making an excited Adam.

34
00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:29.570
And the true energy of forming the minimum energy carbon atom from graphite is

35
00:02:30.091 --> 00:02:33.390
lower than what you do.
Spectroscopically.

36
00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:37.560
So the spectroscopic value is very precise.
You can measure the position,

37
00:02:37.561 --> 00:02:39.900
the color of the light very accurately,

38
00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:42.480
but they didn't know what it corresponded to.

39
00:02:42.481 --> 00:02:47.481
So they needed a different way to know what the energy of the carbon atom was

40
00:02:47.641 --> 00:02:51.600
relative to graphite.
Now,
uh,
uh,

41
00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:54.200
professor Sharpless said,
you know,
he,

42
00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:58.590
he talked about increasing dimension of carbon.
Start with an Adam,
go to a line,

43
00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:01.660
Polyacetal lead,
and then do a bunch of double bonds.

44
00:03:01.661 --> 00:03:04.300
And finally to a saturated hydrocarbon.

45
00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:08.200
He said that carbon atoms are very hard to come by.
You need a really,

46
00:03:08.201 --> 00:03:10.990
really low vacuum to get it right.

47
00:03:10.991 --> 00:03:15.991
That is the equilibrium constant for carbon atoms coming together to form bonds

48
00:03:16.241 --> 00:03:19.900
is very,
very favorable,
right?
So it's hard to get Adam's,

49
00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:22.990
so how are you ever going to get Adam's?
Well,

50
00:03:22.991 --> 00:03:25.570
let's think about that problem here.

51
00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:30.280
So we know that the equilibrium constant is at room temperature is 10 to the

52
00:03:30.281 --> 00:03:32.110
minus three fourths,
Delta e.

53
00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:37.000
So you could measure k then you know Delta e.
So,
but if,

54
00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:42.030
if the equilibrium you're trying to measure is between graphite and carbon atoms

55
00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:47.880
and the energy to take a carbon atom out of graphite is 170 kilocalories per

56
00:03:48.071 --> 00:03:53.071
mole than the equilibrium constant is 10 to the minus 127 right?

57
00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:59.010
And that means since there are only something of the order of 10 to the 80 atoms

58
00:03:59.501 --> 00:04:03.040
in the universe,
there would not be at room temperature,

59
00:04:03.041 --> 00:04:07.180
a single carbon atom at equilibrium with,
with graphite,

60
00:04:07.181 --> 00:04:10.330
if everything in the universe was graphite,
right?

61
00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:13.390
So it's not a very favorable equilibrium constant.

62
00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:18.460
What could you do about it if you wanted to measure the equilibrium constant and

63
00:04:18.461 --> 00:04:20.650
in that way,
get the energy difference.

64
00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:25.240
Any knobs you can twist Lucas temperature,

65
00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:28.030
you can increase the temperature,
right?

66
00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:33.390
Because it's Delta e over k t and remember we're talking about room temperature.

67
00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:37.000
So if we met much higher than room temperature,

68
00:04:37.001 --> 00:04:39.580
then the exponent gets much smaller.
So,

69
00:04:39.581 --> 00:04:44.170
suppose we went to 10 times room temperature to 3000 Kelvin,

70
00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:47.470
right?
Then it would be instead of three fourths,

71
00:04:47.471 --> 00:04:51.790
it would be three fortieths cause the denominator would be 10 times bigger.

72
00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:56.290
And now it would be one in 10 to the 13th would be an Adam.

73
00:04:56.650 --> 00:05:00.250
And now that's a substantial number.
If you're talking about Avogadro's number.

74
00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:03.790
So if you had something really,
really sensitive to measure Adams,

75
00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:07.240
you might be able to able to measure the Adams at equilibrium,

76
00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:09.520
but you have to establish equilibrium.

77
00:05:09.521 --> 00:05:14.380
It's something of the order of 3000 degrees,
or at least really,
really hot,
right?

78
00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:19.720
So you could write the equilibrium constant that the concentration of Adam's

79
00:05:19.721 --> 00:05:24.460
over the concentration of graphite in this way that he has to do that is the

80
00:05:24.461 --> 00:05:28.780
heat of formation.
Adam's relative to graphite right now,
of course,

81
00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:33.490
exactly what one means by the concentration of graphite,
uh,
needs to be,

82
00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:36.040
you scratch your head a little bit about that,
right?

83
00:05:36.970 --> 00:05:41.290
But you don't actually need to know it because if you could measure the pressure

84
00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:45.880
of the c Adams at equilibrium with graphite at very high temperature,

85
00:05:45.881 --> 00:05:48.670
call that the pressure of carbon,
right?

86
00:05:48.970 --> 00:05:53.500
That is some constant and that constant will include whatever this concentration

87
00:05:53.501 --> 00:05:58.501
of graphite should be so be so multiply both sides by that concentration of

88
00:05:59.331 --> 00:06:00.110
graphite,
right?

89
00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:05.110
So we get some constant on the right and then that heat a formation in the

90
00:06:05.151 --> 00:06:09.050
exponent that we want to find.
So that means we could,
right,

91
00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:10.820
if we took the log of both sides,

92
00:06:10.821 --> 00:06:15.350
you have the log of the pressure of carbon atoms is log of whatever be is that

93
00:06:15.351 --> 00:06:18.800
some constant minus this other term?

94
00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:24.280
And what that means is that if you that that minus the heat of formation to the

95
00:06:24.741 --> 00:06:29.741
carbon atom divided by r is the slope of a plot of the pressure of carbon atoms

96
00:06:33.470 --> 00:06:38.300
versus one over t is everyone see that in that equation?

97
00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:43.640
That equation says that there's an intercept which is the log of B and the slope

98
00:06:44.660 --> 00:06:48.410
which is minus Delta h formation of carbon divided by r.

99
00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:52.070
If you plot against one over t everybody with me on that,

100
00:06:53.180 --> 00:06:55.670
not if you see it,
okay?

101
00:06:56.600 --> 00:07:01.550
So all you need to do is plot the log of the pressure of carbon atoms,

102
00:07:01.551 --> 00:07:06.551
which will be very low versus one over t at very high temperature,

103
00:07:07.670 --> 00:07:09.710
right?
Or the order of 3000 Kelvin.

104
00:07:10.970 --> 00:07:14.000
So that's not easy to do,

105
00:07:14.330 --> 00:07:18.860
but it was done in 1955 by Chubb,
Fka and Ingram.

106
00:07:19.550 --> 00:07:23.510
And this is the,
the,
uh,
a sketch of their,

107
00:07:23.750 --> 00:07:27.170
of their instrument.
And I'll go show you how they did it first,

108
00:07:27.230 --> 00:07:30.410
there's a graphite cylinder,
okay?

109
00:07:31.010 --> 00:07:35.780
And around it is a can made out of tantalum.
Now,

110
00:07:35.781 --> 00:07:36.710
why tantalum?

111
00:07:37.250 --> 00:07:40.850
Because that's about the highest melting thing you can get.

112
00:07:41.450 --> 00:07:44.390
It's the highest melting metal.
So 3000,

113
00:07:44.391 --> 00:07:47.150
293 Kelvin as it's melting point.

114
00:07:47.510 --> 00:07:51.410
So you could really hate the heck out of this thing.
Okay?

115
00:07:51.830 --> 00:07:56.780
And now you surround that with wires and those wires are made of tungsten

116
00:07:56.781 --> 00:08:01.480
because that's very high belting too.
And so you connect,
why are you,

117
00:08:01.481 --> 00:08:05.120
you can you connect a electricity to the,
to those,
to the tungsten.

118
00:08:05.121 --> 00:08:06.530
And also to the tantalum.

119
00:08:06.890 --> 00:08:11.840
So electrons boil off the tungsten and bombard the tantalum.

120
00:08:12.080 --> 00:08:15.440
And when the electrons heat it,
they hit it,
they heat it up.

121
00:08:16.100 --> 00:08:20.120
So you can heat the heck out of this tantalum can by bombarding it with

122
00:08:20.121 --> 00:08:20.954
electrons.

123
00:08:22.190 --> 00:08:26.240
And that of course heats the graphite that's inside now.

124
00:08:26.241 --> 00:08:31.241
So inside there's going to be a gas of carbon in equilibrium with the graphite.

125
00:08:33.140 --> 00:08:34.730
Now it won't just be Seattle's,

126
00:08:34.760 --> 00:08:39.350
there'll also be t c two c three c 60 70 and so on,

127
00:08:39.620 --> 00:08:42.590
but lots of different forms of carbon as a guest.

128
00:08:42.591 --> 00:08:44.570
So you can't just measure the pressure in there.

129
00:08:44.780 --> 00:08:49.160
And indeed it would be tough to measure the pressure inside at 3000 degrees,

130
00:08:49.640 --> 00:08:54.590
but you at least have these things.
They're at equilibrium.
Now what he,

131
00:08:54.650 --> 00:08:57.630
what they did,
Chuck Good Ingram was the drill,

132
00:08:57.631 --> 00:09:00.480
a tiny hole in the top of this thing.

133
00:09:01.320 --> 00:09:04.560
And that will allow a little bit of the gas to escape.

134
00:09:04.800 --> 00:09:09.510
Not so much that you destroy the equilibrium inside,
just a really slow leak,

135
00:09:10.080 --> 00:09:10.740
right?

136
00:09:10.740 --> 00:09:15.540
So now if you could measure the amount of these different carbon species leaking

137
00:09:15.541 --> 00:09:19.800
out,
you could know what the pressure of them was inside the can.

138
00:09:20.820 --> 00:09:22.470
Okay,
now,

139
00:09:22.770 --> 00:09:26.460
so there's a beam of carbon species coming out.

140
00:09:26.461 --> 00:09:30.780
Gaseous carbon species.
This is all at very,
very high vacuum,
right?

141
00:09:30.960 --> 00:09:32.130
And then up there,

142
00:09:32.280 --> 00:09:37.280
an electron beam comes across and hits these carbon things and knocks electrons

143
00:09:37.801 --> 00:09:38.634
out of them,

144
00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:44.600
and that converts them into c Plus C one c two c three c 60 plus.

145
00:09:46.500 --> 00:09:47.333
Okay,

146
00:09:47.700 --> 00:09:51.600
so you have a beam coming out of these charged carbon species.

147
00:09:51.900 --> 00:09:56.250
Now why do you want them to be charged for two reasons?
One,

148
00:09:56.310 --> 00:10:00.810
so you can detect them because you can detect it when charge hits a plate.

149
00:10:01.380 --> 00:10:06.380
And the other one is so you can deflect the beams with a magnetic field,

150
00:10:07.230 --> 00:10:07.740
right?

151
00:10:07.740 --> 00:10:12.330
So these various carbon species come out and they go into a magnetic field,

152
00:10:12.540 --> 00:10:16.080
which puts a lateral force on them and causes them to bend.

153
00:10:16.710 --> 00:10:21.120
And of course the lighter they are,
the easier they are to bend.

154
00:10:21.240 --> 00:10:26.190
If they all have the same charge.
So you're going to get curved trajectories.

155
00:10:26.191 --> 00:10:30.180
C three plus c two plus c one plus will be the most bent.

156
00:10:30.630 --> 00:10:33.420
And now if you put a detector at these different positions,

157
00:10:33.421 --> 00:10:37.830
you can see how much c one,
how much CPU,
how much c three there were,
there was.

158
00:10:39.270 --> 00:10:41.520
Okay,
so that's how you're going to do it.

159
00:10:41.521 --> 00:10:44.640
But this machine has to be pretty special because you're heating it.

160
00:10:44.641 --> 00:10:46.720
So Hi Lucas electrons.

161
00:10:48.630 --> 00:10:51.480
It can knock off two,
but then you get it at a very different position.

162
00:10:51.481 --> 00:10:52.380
You can tell these things.

163
00:10:54.690 --> 00:10:56.550
This thing is called mass spectroscopy,

164
00:10:56.970 --> 00:11:00.210
but it knocks off one much more often than it knocks off two or three.

165
00:11:01.840 --> 00:11:04.150
Kind of the same problems we had with the other thing.

166
00:11:07.920 --> 00:11:08.970
The other thing,

167
00:11:08.971 --> 00:11:12.920
I can't remember what we couldn't measure the other one because it was a higher

168
00:11:12.921 --> 00:11:13.800
energy state.

169
00:11:17.960 --> 00:11:21.690
Might it be an excited state yet?
No,
because it's an equilibrium.

170
00:11:22.500 --> 00:11:23.940
The excited state would be much,

171
00:11:23.941 --> 00:11:28.260
much less at equilibrium because it's higher in energy.
Okay,
good.

172
00:11:28.530 --> 00:11:30.750
Good point though.
Good.
You thought about that now.

173
00:11:30.751 --> 00:11:34.890
So you have to put shielding around this stuff so it doesn't melt everything.

174
00:11:35.310 --> 00:11:38.590
So you use tantalum,
which is high melting and eh,

175
00:11:38.650 --> 00:11:43.200
and a series of can inside a can like Russian dolls,

176
00:11:43.650 --> 00:11:48.210
right?
So the,
the inside,
inside most one is very,
very hot than a little less hot,

177
00:11:48.211 --> 00:11:49.830
a little less hot.
Okay.

178
00:11:49.831 --> 00:11:54.280
So you shield it and now you need to know the temperature inside.

179
00:11:54.280 --> 00:11:57.310
And you do it by drilling a tiny hole through those shields.

180
00:11:57.490 --> 00:12:00.880
So you can have what's called an optical pyrometer.

181
00:12:00.881 --> 00:12:04.960
That's just something that looks at the color of something that's really hot and

182
00:12:04.961 --> 00:12:06.120
something that's hot gives our,

183
00:12:06.130 --> 00:12:09.160
even something that's cold gives off black body radiation.

184
00:12:09.400 --> 00:12:13.270
And the color has to do with the,
uh,
with the temperature.
You know,

185
00:12:13.271 --> 00:12:16.420
there's red heat,
yt,
blue heat and so on.

186
00:12:16.720 --> 00:12:18.340
So by measuring the color,

187
00:12:18.520 --> 00:12:23.470
you can see what the temperature was inside and that window that the light comes

188
00:12:23.471 --> 00:12:27.130
through has to be made of courts,
not Pyrex glass.
You know,
why?

189
00:12:29.410 --> 00:12:33.070
Cause Pyrex glass would melt even at that distance,
right?

190
00:12:33.550 --> 00:12:38.110
So that you use,
uh,
court's glass.
Okay?
So that's what you do.

191
00:12:38.500 --> 00:12:43.090
And here's a graph of the pressure of these various species measured with that

192
00:12:43.091 --> 00:12:47.800
mass spectrometer at different temperatures measured as one over the temperature

193
00:12:47.801 --> 00:12:48.310
here.

194
00:12:48.310 --> 00:12:53.310
So it goes from 2150 Kelvin to 24 50 Kelvin and the pressure increases and it's

195
00:12:53.801 --> 00:12:57.190
plotted as the log of the intensity of the signal.

196
00:12:57.191 --> 00:13:01.480
That is the pressure times temperature because the pressure has to be corrected

197
00:13:01.481 --> 00:13:02.314
for temperature.

198
00:13:02.350 --> 00:13:05.830
Because if you have the same number of things giving the pressure but they're

199
00:13:05.831 --> 00:13:09.070
hotter,
there'll be pressing harder on things.
There'll be.
So you have,
it's the,

200
00:13:09.520 --> 00:13:13.450
it's the intensity of the signal times the temperature that you plot there.

201
00:13:14.080 --> 00:13:19.080
And from the slope you can see up there at the top that foresee one you get the

202
00:13:19.091 --> 00:13:24.091
slope says it's a 171 kilocalories per mole QED.

203
00:13:24.400 --> 00:13:27.730
Right now,
you know,
which was the right one measured by spectroscopy.

204
00:13:27.940 --> 00:13:32.680
It was the one that said 171 so this experiment actually measuring the

205
00:13:32.681 --> 00:13:37.681
equilibrium between carbon atoms and graphite by a really a Gargantuan kind of

206
00:13:38.861 --> 00:13:42.190
experiment is what settled the question finally.

207
00:13:42.550 --> 00:13:45.630
So that when you look at the appendix of this book,
striped,
wiser,

208
00:13:45.631 --> 00:13:46.930
half Cochon costs hour,

209
00:13:47.200 --> 00:13:51.340
you find that there are heats of formation for Adams and radicals measured by

210
00:13:51.341 --> 00:13:53.200
spectroscopy and things like this.

211
00:13:53.530 --> 00:13:58.530
And there you see carbon 170.9 and that was done by professor Chupp go who was

212
00:13:58.811 --> 00:14:01.600
in this department and who used to come and tell people how he did this

213
00:14:01.601 --> 00:14:02.830
experiment.
But as you can see,

214
00:14:02.831 --> 00:14:06.930
he passed away in 2007 so thanks to Professor Chupp Cook.

215
00:14:08.320 --> 00:14:11.230
And the Nice thing is,
once that's done,
it's done.

216
00:14:12.160 --> 00:14:15.610
Now you know it and you just plug it in when you burn your stuff and want to

217
00:14:15.611 --> 00:14:19.090
know what its energy as you could get it relative to carbon atoms in the gas

218
00:14:19.091 --> 00:14:23.200
phase.
Okay.
Now how good are these spectroscopic experiments?
Well,

219
00:14:23.201 --> 00:14:24.280
this is a neat thing.

220
00:14:24.550 --> 00:14:28.810
The heat of atomization of methane measured in the ways we've just been talking

221
00:14:28.811 --> 00:14:32.680
about is 397.5 kilocalories per mole.

222
00:14:32.920 --> 00:14:37.920
Now that is co comes from Ma meeting a carbon atom with four hydrogen atoms.

223
00:14:38.501 --> 00:14:41.110
That is 397.5 right?

224
00:14:41.380 --> 00:14:45.160
So we know what the average bond energy there for such bonds,

225
00:14:45.161 --> 00:14:48.430
so each was worth 99.4 kilocalories per mole.

226
00:14:48.610 --> 00:14:51.530
So about a hundred kilocalories per mole for a ch bond.

227
00:14:51.560 --> 00:14:53.870
That's convenient to remember,
okay,

228
00:14:54.680 --> 00:14:59.680
but that's not how much it costs to take a single hydrogen atom away from

229
00:15:00.051 --> 00:15:05.051
methane taking a single hydrogen atom away from methane and the so called bond

230
00:15:05.720 --> 00:15:07.310
dissociation energy,

231
00:15:07.580 --> 00:15:12.260
which is the actual experimental energy it takes to do some particular process.

232
00:15:12.530 --> 00:15:17.120
Everage bond energy is just an average,
but the individual ones are not the same.

233
00:15:17.450 --> 00:15:22.450
Taking a hydrogen away from methane is 104 point 99 plus or minus 0.03

234
00:15:23.330 --> 00:15:26.360
kilocalories per mole close,
but not the same thing.

235
00:15:26.840 --> 00:15:31.840
And then you have ch three if you take another second h off that it's 110.4 the

236
00:15:32.091 --> 00:15:37.091
next one is 101.3 and the final one taking Hoa from C is only 80.9 right now.

237
00:15:39.021 --> 00:15:39.620
These are,

238
00:15:39.620 --> 00:15:44.620
these are done by spectroscopy and Barney Ellison may come talk to us in the

239
00:15:44.720 --> 00:15:44.721
spring.

240
00:15:44.721 --> 00:15:48.410
He is often traveling through and talks about how he measured these things.

241
00:15:48.560 --> 00:15:50.300
But those are done by spectroscopy.

242
00:15:50.301 --> 00:15:54.770
But the neat thing about it is if you add all those four numbers together,

243
00:15:56.040 --> 00:16:00.410
so pardon me,
I was going to say no individual bond equals the average,

244
00:16:00.800 --> 00:16:02.960
right?
But if you add them together,

245
00:16:02.961 --> 00:16:07.370
you get 397.5 which is precisely the average.

246
00:16:07.371 --> 00:16:09.080
So these are very good experiments.

247
00:16:09.440 --> 00:16:14.300
So we know through heroic a spectroscopy and these,

248
00:16:14.330 --> 00:16:18.560
this work of chuck good and Ingram,
we know what these energies are.

249
00:16:18.561 --> 00:16:22.040
Bond Energies and Bond Association,

250
00:16:22.280 --> 00:16:23.630
dissociation energies.

251
00:16:23.900 --> 00:16:27.980
So here our average bond energies in a table that you have at the end of this

252
00:16:27.981 --> 00:16:29.210
organic chemistry text,

253
00:16:29.450 --> 00:16:33.560
and it says a carbon hydrogen bond is 99 and now you see where we get that.

254
00:16:34.130 --> 00:16:38.780
Uh,
and you see that the carbon,
uh,
carbon bond is 83,

255
00:16:39.110 --> 00:16:43.700
but the second carbon carbon bond and the double bond is only 63,

256
00:16:44.150 --> 00:16:45.470
right?
Why is it weaker?

257
00:16:46.580 --> 00:16:50.090
Why is the second bond of a carbon carbon double bond weaker?

258
00:16:53.580 --> 00:16:56.410
<v 1>Then the first,
pardon me,</v>

259
00:16:59.230 --> 00:17:00.130
Devon,
what do you say?

260
00:17:01.730 --> 00:17:06.230
<v 0>Yeah,
you have bad overlap between the Pi electrons.
In fact,</v>

261
00:17:07.010 --> 00:17:08.540
the first,
the single bond,

262
00:17:08.550 --> 00:17:12.470
the a double bond is probably stronger than a normal single bond.

263
00:17:12.980 --> 00:17:14.450
Can anybody see why that would be?

264
00:17:17.510 --> 00:17:21.560
Scott Morris character better overlap?
Sp squared,
sp squared.

265
00:17:21.920 --> 00:17:26.450
So the second one is probably more than 20 kilocalories weaker than the single

266
00:17:26.451 --> 00:17:27.800
one.
But at any rate,

267
00:17:27.830 --> 00:17:32.830
it's 146 for that you add up to get a double bond and 200 for a triple bond,

268
00:17:33.231 --> 00:17:38.090
which means the third bond is worth only 54 kilocalories per mole.
Okay?

269
00:17:38.590 --> 00:17:41.460
Uh,
and in c double Bondo,
it's uh,

270
00:17:41.550 --> 00:17:45.130
it's about the same as,
as cc.

271
00:17:45.670 --> 00:17:50.670
So CEO is 86.
Uh,
but the double bond notice is different in this case.

272
00:17:50.671 --> 00:17:53.820
Now the second bond is stronger than the first.

273
00:17:54.240 --> 00:17:57.810
So the carbon eel group is an especially stable group.

274
00:18:01.470 --> 00:18:03.510
Okay.
So you have the question,

275
00:18:03.511 --> 00:18:08.511
can you sum up these average bond energies and get useful heats of atomization?

276
00:18:08.820 --> 00:18:13.620
So can you look at a structure and say how stable it's going to be?
Okay,

277
00:18:13.621 --> 00:18:17.180
so let's try it.
So here's heats of atomization by additives,

278
00:18:17.181 --> 00:18:18.930
city of average bond energies.

279
00:18:19.320 --> 00:18:21.930
So we have these average bond energies from the table.

280
00:18:21.931 --> 00:18:26.931
A CC single bond is 83 is c h is 99 c double bond c is 1406806111 and so on.

281
00:18:29.250 --> 00:18:32.340
And we're going to set them all up to give the heat of at and compare it with

282
00:18:32.341 --> 00:18:35.520
the actual heat of atomization.
Okay,

283
00:18:35.521 --> 00:18:39.450
so for ethene there,
there are four ch bonds.

284
00:18:39.750 --> 00:18:42.240
There's one CC double bond,
add them up,

285
00:18:42.241 --> 00:18:47.241
and you get 542 the actual heat of atomization is 537.7 so there's,

286
00:18:48.390 --> 00:18:50.940
there's an error of 4.3 kilocalories per mole,

287
00:18:50.941 --> 00:18:55.410
which is less than 1% that's pretty good.
But on the other hand,

288
00:18:55.800 --> 00:19:00.780
ethene probably entered in to determining these average bond energies,

289
00:19:00.950 --> 00:19:05.430
right?
So it's not a hundred percent fair.
Okay.
How about cyclohexane?

290
00:19:05.460 --> 00:19:10.280
Now we have six carbon carbon's single bonds and 12 carbon hydrogen single
bonds,

291
00:19:10.281 --> 00:19:15.281
1686 versus 1680 0.1 and error of only 5.9 less than half a percent error.

292
00:19:17.460 --> 00:19:21.690
So pretty good by adding up bond cyclohexanone [inaudible] remember we had quite

293
00:19:21.691 --> 00:19:25.320
a bit of trouble with these partly oxidized things before when we were trying to

294
00:19:25.321 --> 00:19:29.190
just do it on the basis of the elements.
But if you add bonds together,

295
00:19:29.340 --> 00:19:34.290
you get within 0.3% of the right value.
Or if you do glucose,

296
00:19:34.291 --> 00:19:37.110
which has a lots of oxygens in it,

297
00:19:37.590 --> 00:19:40.020
then you get a within again,

298
00:19:40.021 --> 00:19:43.230
less than 1% 0.7% of the right value.

299
00:19:44.130 --> 00:19:48.690
So this is pretty darn good.
Very impressive.
Very small errors to predict these.

300
00:19:48.691 --> 00:19:51.000
But the question is,
is it useful?

301
00:19:51.330 --> 00:19:54.990
How accurate does it have to be to be useful?
So why do,

302
00:19:55.020 --> 00:19:56.670
why do you need to know the values?

303
00:19:56.671 --> 00:19:58.680
Because you want to know equilibrium constants.

304
00:19:58.681 --> 00:20:02.910
You want to know which direction a reaction will go,
for example.
Okay,

305
00:20:02.911 --> 00:20:06.750
so we know that the,
if we want to calculate a,

306
00:20:06.790 --> 00:20:08.010
an equilibrium constant,

307
00:20:08.011 --> 00:20:10.820
we can do it at room temperature with this three fourths drink.

308
00:20:11.430 --> 00:20:15.360
So the calculated equilibrium constant is whatever we're calculating here for

309
00:20:15.361 --> 00:20:18.930
energy between two things,
we have two things.
Calculate the energy of these,

310
00:20:19.170 --> 00:20:20.190
the energy of these.

311
00:20:20.191 --> 00:20:23.370
Compare to the energies and that'll give us the equilibrium constant according

312
00:20:23.371 --> 00:20:28.290
to this formula.
But notice I'm doing it on the basis of calculation now.

313
00:20:28.590 --> 00:20:32.700
Uh,
so that's whatever the calculated energy is,

314
00:20:32.701 --> 00:20:34.770
whatever the true energy would be.

315
00:20:35.580 --> 00:20:38.790
But there's also some error in there.
Okay.

316
00:20:39.180 --> 00:20:44.070
But if you add two exponent,
that's the same as multiplying two things together.

317
00:20:44.070 --> 00:20:48.790
So the calculated equilibrium constant is the true equilibrium constant.

318
00:20:48.791 --> 00:20:52.930
That's the first part.
The part that has with Delta h true times,

319
00:20:53.560 --> 00:20:55.840
the part that has this exponent,
right?

320
00:20:55.990 --> 00:20:58.570
Three fourths of that Delta h error.

321
00:20:58.990 --> 00:21:01.960
So if you want the error to be small,

322
00:21:01.961 --> 00:21:06.730
that factor to be small than Delta h error has to be small,

323
00:21:06.940 --> 00:21:10.120
small,
not on a percentage basis,

324
00:21:11.380 --> 00:21:15.070
but absolutely it has to be small that that error,

325
00:21:16.450 --> 00:21:20.500
not the percentage error determines this error factor.
Right?

326
00:21:20.770 --> 00:21:25.390
So to keep the error less than a factor of 10 in the equilibrium constant,

327
00:21:25.720 --> 00:21:30.720
you need to know that equilibrium constants within 1.3 kilocalories per mole.

328
00:21:31.090 --> 00:21:33.070
So that three fourths of it will be one.

329
00:21:33.071 --> 00:21:37.330
And that would mean you'd be within a factor of 10.
Everybody with me on this.

330
00:21:38.590 --> 00:21:41.050
So you need to do even better than this.

331
00:21:41.350 --> 00:21:45.100
You can't use the average bond energies and get something that's very useful

332
00:21:45.370 --> 00:21:49.870
because if you're off by 16 down here in the case of sugar,
that beans,

333
00:21:49.871 --> 00:21:54.871
you're off by a factor of 10 to the 12th in predicting the equilibrium constant,

334
00:21:55.031 --> 00:21:58.690
which wouldn't be acceptable probably.
Okay.

335
00:22:00.260 --> 00:22:01.000
Uh,

336
00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:06.000
so let's try it with the equilibrium between a ketone and the so called Enal,

337
00:22:07.720 --> 00:22:11.140
which is an isomer of a ketone in which a hydrogen has been taken from the

338
00:22:11.141 --> 00:22:15.700
methyl group on the right and put on the oxygen and a double bond moved.
Okay,

339
00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:20.470
so that's a very important equilibrium that will encounter when we talk about

340
00:22:20.471 --> 00:22:22.570
the chemistry of ketones.

341
00:22:23.680 --> 00:22:25.540
Let's see what the equilibrium constant.

342
00:22:25.541 --> 00:22:27.730
Should there be more ketone or more enal?

343
00:22:27.990 --> 00:22:31.750
You have a guest right off the out at the outset of which one would be more

344
00:22:32.410 --> 00:22:33.243
stable.

345
00:22:36.940 --> 00:22:41.940
I would guess the key tone because what I just told you that the COO double bond

346
00:22:43.271 --> 00:22:48.250
is remarkably stable.
Right?
And the other case you have a CC double bond.
Okay.

347
00:22:48.251 --> 00:22:52.660
Let's see.
Now we could add together all the bonds,

348
00:22:52.930 --> 00:22:56.790
but most of them are the most bonds are the same between the starting material

349
00:22:56.791 --> 00:23:01.180
and product.
We only need to compare the ones that change.
Okay,

350
00:23:01.360 --> 00:23:05.770
so we've highlighted in red the bonds that change between the two forms,

351
00:23:05.771 --> 00:23:06.790
the two isomers

352
00:23:08.350 --> 00:23:11.770
cause we're interested in the difference in energy between these two to get the

353
00:23:11.771 --> 00:23:13.570
equilibrium constant.
Okay,

354
00:23:13.571 --> 00:23:16.720
so these are the numbers I took from the table that you see on the top left

355
00:23:16.721 --> 00:23:20.410
there 179 for CEO,
double bond and so on.

356
00:23:22.060 --> 00:23:22.601
Uh,

357
00:23:22.601 --> 00:23:27.601
and I saw them up and that's 361 for those bonds and the new set of bonds in the

358
00:23:27.791 --> 00:23:28.624
eternal,

359
00:23:28.630 --> 00:23:33.130
some to 343 so the ketone indeed is more stable.

360
00:23:33.130 --> 00:23:35.980
It appears by 18 kilocalories per mole.

361
00:23:36.550 --> 00:23:41.550
So 18 kilocalories per mole means that you have a factor of 10 to the 13th.

362
00:23:41.800 --> 00:23:44.830
The equilibrium constant is tend to the 13.5.

363
00:23:46.040 --> 00:23:50.420
So it should lie for practical purposes entirely in the direction of the ketone.

364
00:23:52.130 --> 00:23:54.110
However,
if you do it experimentally,

365
00:23:55.040 --> 00:24:00.040
you find that the equilibrium constant is only 10 to the seventh not 10 to the

366
00:24:00.981 --> 00:24:03.110
14th right?

367
00:24:03.590 --> 00:24:08.100
So the true energy difference is 9.3 kilocalories,

368
00:24:08.120 --> 00:24:12.020
not the 18 that we got by adding bonds together.

369
00:24:13.130 --> 00:24:17.720
Right?
So that means we're going to have to deal with,
uh,

370
00:24:18.290 --> 00:24:22.640
addressing why the eternal is too stable.

371
00:24:22.850 --> 00:24:27.850
It's nine kilocalories per mole to stable compared to our predictions on the

372
00:24:28.251 --> 00:24:32.450
basis of adding bonds together.
Now,
why?
Well,

373
00:24:32.451 --> 00:24:34.760
one thing is that we,

374
00:24:35.030 --> 00:24:40.030
that those bonds that we canceled to ch bonds that didn't change,

375
00:24:41.150 --> 00:24:46.010
in fact did change between the starting material and the product.

376
00:24:46.280 --> 00:24:50.120
Why could I say that?
They did change and both cases on both sides,

377
00:24:50.121 --> 00:24:53.060
they're single carbon carbon.
It's carbon hydrogen bonds.

378
00:24:53.390 --> 00:24:55.160
How can I say they change Angela,

379
00:25:01.280 --> 00:25:04.640
right?
They're changing hybridization actually.
Yeah.

380
00:25:04.641 --> 00:25:09.220
There go from sp three to SB two on the carbon as you go across and the SP twos

381
00:25:09.230 --> 00:25:12.230
on the right,
it should be more stable.
Okay.

382
00:25:12.231 --> 00:25:16.070
So the SB two h should be stronger,
so that's good.
The,

383
00:25:16.071 --> 00:25:18.200
so these things that I was saying canceled,

384
00:25:18.230 --> 00:25:21.530
do not actually cancel if we take hybridization into account.

385
00:25:21.890 --> 00:25:26.120
So that's one factor.
And there's another,
uh,
as well,

386
00:25:26.270 --> 00:25:31.270
which as you have that unshared pair of on the top right here on the oxygen is

387
00:25:33.201 --> 00:25:35.060
adjacent to a double bond.

388
00:25:35.480 --> 00:25:40.480
That means that this high homo can be stabilized by the Pi star low Lumo.

389
00:25:40.790 --> 00:25:44.750
We'll overlap that isn't the possibility here where the unshared pairs on the

390
00:25:44.751 --> 00:25:48.370
oxygen did not overlap with the Pi.
Uh,

391
00:25:48.800 --> 00:25:50.950
Pi Star orbital.
Uh,

392
00:25:50.960 --> 00:25:55.960
so you get in trouble like killer Homo Lumo mixing in the eternal that you don't

393
00:25:56.121 --> 00:26:00.470
get in the ketone,
which will help stabilize the enal.
With that,

394
00:26:00.500 --> 00:26:02.300
we could draw that resonance structure.

395
00:26:02.930 --> 00:26:07.430
So those two things together make up that nine kilocalories error,

396
00:26:07.880 --> 00:26:10.550
or at least we can think they contribute to it at least.

397
00:26:11.270 --> 00:26:14.150
So constitutional energy,

398
00:26:14.270 --> 00:26:17.360
what we would get by adding bonds together,
uh,

399
00:26:17.570 --> 00:26:21.910
has to be corrected for various effects.
We,

400
00:26:21.911 --> 00:26:25.820
we'll call them such as resonance.
That's what we just looked at.

401
00:26:25.821 --> 00:26:30.821
Like this homo Lumo thing such as hybridization changes or such as strain as in

402
00:26:33.831 --> 00:26:37.070
the case of axial methyl cyclohexane that we looked at.

403
00:26:37.400 --> 00:26:42.400
So there are lots of lots of these corrections that you have to apply to this

404
00:26:42.590 --> 00:26:46.050
model where you add together,
uh,
uh,

405
00:26:46.080 --> 00:26:49.740
bond energies in order to predict the energies of a particular molecule.

406
00:26:49.980 --> 00:26:51.360
But for many cases,

407
00:26:51.361 --> 00:26:55.500
now you can do a pretty good job of predicting these things and actually not do

408
00:26:55.501 --> 00:26:59.040
so bad at predicting,
uh,
uh,

409
00:26:59.340 --> 00:27:04.310
relative energies of isomers and therefore equilibrium constants.
And these,

410
00:27:04.620 --> 00:27:09.060
the effects of course are a polite name for error,
right?

411
00:27:09.150 --> 00:27:13.320
They're correcting various ways of correcting errors that you think there should

412
00:27:13.321 --> 00:27:16.560
be in this scheme of just the heading bonds together.

413
00:27:17.940 --> 00:27:21.660
Now,
energy to terms determines what can happen.

414
00:27:21.661 --> 00:27:26.100
Things always move toward equilibrium,
right?
So,

415
00:27:26.380 --> 00:27:31.260
so if the ratio of two things is something with equilibrium ratio is different,

416
00:27:31.530 --> 00:27:36.000
that ratio will always move toward that,
uh,

417
00:27:36.270 --> 00:27:39.150
toward the equilibrium if it's in isolation.

418
00:27:39.630 --> 00:27:43.920
But there's another equally important thing is how fast will it go there.

419
00:27:44.280 --> 00:27:49.110
And that as we've seen before is to can be approximated as 10 to the 13th per

420
00:27:49.111 --> 00:27:51.540
second times.
Uh,

421
00:27:51.570 --> 00:27:54.690
this same kind of factor related to the barrier.

422
00:27:55.860 --> 00:28:00.860
Now both of these things suggest that have being low in energy is good,

423
00:28:03.750 --> 00:28:06.210
right?
Your favorite things that are low in energy,

424
00:28:06.660 --> 00:28:09.090
but you might ask why.

425
00:28:10.020 --> 00:28:14.400
That's not what people say about money.
They don't say the less money you have,

426
00:28:14.401 --> 00:28:18.510
the better,
right?
Why?
The less energy the better.

427
00:28:19.350 --> 00:28:23.670
This is a really interesting case and it has to do with statistics and

428
00:28:23.671 --> 00:28:24.870
especially at Yale,

429
00:28:25.080 --> 00:28:29.490
we should talk about this because in 19 two,

430
00:28:29.491 --> 00:28:31.710
when Yale celebrated its bicentennial,

431
00:28:31.980 --> 00:28:36.520
they've published a number of books showing off the scholarship of Yale.
Uh,

432
00:28:36.630 --> 00:28:37.950
as you can see here,

433
00:28:38.370 --> 00:28:43.370
and the most important of those books by about 500 miles was this one elementary

434
00:28:44.851 --> 00:28:49.560
principals in statistical mechanics and the rational foundation of

435
00:28:49.561 --> 00:28:52.170
thermodynamics by j Willard Gibbs.

436
00:28:52.770 --> 00:28:55.440
So it's statistical mechanics.

437
00:28:55.441 --> 00:29:00.120
It's trying to understand the behavior of chemical substances on the basis of

438
00:29:00.121 --> 00:29:01.140
statistics.

439
00:29:03.900 --> 00:29:06.960
Now when you do this,
you get exponents.

440
00:29:07.590 --> 00:29:12.590
And the Organization of our presentation here is going to have to do with three

441
00:29:13.291 --> 00:29:18.291
different ways in which statistics enters in to exponents for purposes of doing

442
00:29:21.390 --> 00:29:24.630
equilibrium.
So there's the Boltzmann factor,

443
00:29:24.840 --> 00:29:26.310
that's what we've been talking about,

444
00:29:26.311 --> 00:29:30.150
the 10 to the three fourths Delta h that's called the Boltzmann factor.

445
00:29:30.240 --> 00:29:32.010
It includes the Boltzmann constant.

446
00:29:32.550 --> 00:29:34.560
Then there are things that have to do with entropy,

447
00:29:34.561 --> 00:29:37.440
which is often seems to be a very confusing topic.

448
00:29:40.290 --> 00:29:43.090
And finally there's a thing called the law of mass action.

449
00:29:44.230 --> 00:29:46.960
And all of these things have exponents in them.

450
00:29:47.410 --> 00:29:52.090
And if you understand how the exponent behave,
you understand what's going on.

451
00:29:52.780 --> 00:29:55.000
So let's look first at the Boltzmann factor.

452
00:29:55.870 --> 00:30:00.280
So here's Ludvig Boltzmann who committed suicide in 19 six.

453
00:30:01.720 --> 00:30:05.470
And this is important paper on the relationship between the second law of

454
00:30:05.471 --> 00:30:08.830
thermodynamics and probability calculations.

455
00:30:09.160 --> 00:30:14.160
So statistics regarding the laws of thermal equilibrium in 1877.

456
00:30:15.470 --> 00:30:20.380
Uh,
and his key equation is s equals k log w.

457
00:30:20.830 --> 00:30:24.160
So log relates to an exponential and we'll see why that is.

458
00:30:24.760 --> 00:30:27.730
And here's his tombstone in the cemetery in Vienna.

459
00:30:28.090 --> 00:30:32.890
And you'll notice up at the top there as equals k log w.

460
00:30:34.060 --> 00:30:34.893
Okay,

461
00:30:35.740 --> 00:30:40.740
so what Boltzmann considered was the implication of random distribution of

462
00:30:41.561 --> 00:30:42.310
energy.

463
00:30:42.310 --> 00:30:46.240
Suppose you have a certain amount of energy in a system but it's distributed at

464
00:30:46.241 --> 00:30:47.950
random,
right?

465
00:30:47.951 --> 00:30:51.790
So it's purely statistically then how should it be distributed,

466
00:30:51.791 --> 00:30:56.110
how much energy should any particular molecule have is the question.

467
00:30:57.580 --> 00:31:00.460
And we can visualize this in a simple case,

468
00:31:00.461 --> 00:31:04.360
which is very like what he did except he did it analytically and in a much

469
00:31:04.600 --> 00:31:05.830
bigger system,

470
00:31:06.190 --> 00:31:11.190
but just using four containers which are like molecules and each one can have a

471
00:31:11.201 --> 00:31:14.710
certain amount of energy in it and we'll consider the energy to be,

472
00:31:14.740 --> 00:31:16.030
to come in bits.

473
00:31:16.690 --> 00:31:20.410
He used that idea that there were bits of energy to be distributed among

474
00:31:20.740 --> 00:31:25.480
molecules or degrees of freedom within molecules.
Uh,

475
00:31:25.510 --> 00:31:27.850
he didn't think that energy came in bits,

476
00:31:28.090 --> 00:31:31.690
but it made it possible to do the statistics.
And then he just took the limit.

477
00:31:31.930 --> 00:31:33.610
When these bits get very,
very,
very,

478
00:31:33.611 --> 00:31:38.140
very small so that it becomes like a continuum of stuff,
like a whole sand of,

479
00:31:38.520 --> 00:31:40.270
of energy bits.
But anyhow,

480
00:31:40.271 --> 00:31:44.740
let's just count up and how many different ways there are of putting three

481
00:31:44.741 --> 00:31:49.030
different bits of energy are actually not different.
They're all the same,

482
00:31:49.060 --> 00:31:53.920
but three bits of energy into the red container.
Okay?

483
00:31:54.190 --> 00:31:57.340
So if you,
how many complexions?

484
00:31:57.490 --> 00:32:00.730
That's what any particular arrangement he called a complexion.

485
00:32:01.060 --> 00:32:05.260
How many different complexions have a certain number of bits in the first

486
00:32:05.261 --> 00:32:06.700
container?
Well,

487
00:32:06.701 --> 00:32:11.440
suppose you put all three of those energy bits into the first container.

488
00:32:11.440 --> 00:32:15.520
How many different ways are there of doing that?
Just one.

489
00:32:16.270 --> 00:32:20.080
Okay,
but suppose you put only two into the first container.

490
00:32:20.530 --> 00:32:23.920
Now how many different ways are there of arranging it so that there are two in

491
00:32:23.921 --> 00:32:28.870
the first container,
how many different ways there are?
Three.

492
00:32:28.960 --> 00:32:30.730
One,
two,
three.

493
00:32:31.180 --> 00:32:34.420
So there'll be three ways of putting two bits in the first container.

494
00:32:34.810 --> 00:32:38.440
How many of putting one in the first container while we put one there?

495
00:32:38.441 --> 00:32:42.770
There's one,
two,
three,
four,

496
00:32:43.520 --> 00:32:46.880
five,
six ways of doing it.
Okay,

497
00:32:47.060 --> 00:32:48.950
so there's six ways of putting one in there.

498
00:32:49.190 --> 00:32:53.750
And how many of putting none at all in there.
One,
two,

499
00:32:53.870 --> 00:32:58.190
three,
four,
five,
six,

500
00:32:58.400 --> 00:33:02.810
seven,
eight,
nine,
10.

501
00:33:04.250 --> 00:33:06.560
Okay,
so there are 10 ways of doing that.

502
00:33:06.770 --> 00:33:09.830
So let's make a graph and see how many ways,

503
00:33:09.831 --> 00:33:14.720
what's the probability that you'll have a certain number of bits of energy in

504
00:33:14.721 --> 00:33:19.700
the first container?
Okay,
it looks like that 10,
six,

505
00:33:20.810 --> 00:33:24.620
three one.
And what does that curve look like?

506
00:33:26.540 --> 00:33:27.950
If you made a plot of that,

507
00:33:29.390 --> 00:33:31.640
what type of curve does it look like?

508
00:33:33.530 --> 00:33:34.550
Is it a straight line?

509
00:33:36.440 --> 00:33:40.100
Anybody got a name for it or something that looks a little bit like that?

510
00:33:41.960 --> 00:33:44.390
It's exponential decay.
Now,

511
00:33:44.391 --> 00:33:49.391
it's not truly exponential in this case of three bits among four containers,

512
00:33:50.120 --> 00:33:54.080
but if you do 30 bits among 20 containers,

513
00:33:54.650 --> 00:33:58.460
then it looks like that.
And there is an exponential,
right?

514
00:33:58.640 --> 00:34:03.640
So what Boltzmann was able to do to show mathematically was that the limits when

515
00:34:03.711 --> 00:34:08.711
you have very many very small energy bits is truly an exponential.

516
00:34:10.040 --> 00:34:14.120
So the probability of having a certain amount of energy in a degree of freedom

517
00:34:14.210 --> 00:34:15.230
is exponential.

518
00:34:15.260 --> 00:34:19.310
E to the minus whatever that energy is divided by Katie.

519
00:34:19.700 --> 00:34:23.570
So Boltzmann showed that that was the limit for lots of infinite testable energy

520
00:34:23.571 --> 00:34:24.404
bits.

521
00:34:24.560 --> 00:34:29.560
And the idea behind it is quite clear if all the complexions for a given total

522
00:34:30.860 --> 00:34:33.740
are equally likely,
and that's what he assumes.
It's random.

523
00:34:33.770 --> 00:34:35.390
They can be any place they want to be.

524
00:34:35.870 --> 00:34:40.870
Then shifting energy into any one degree of freedom of one molecule is

525
00:34:42.801 --> 00:34:46.100
disfavored.
Because when you put more in one molecule,

526
00:34:46.550 --> 00:34:50.570
there are fewer ways to distribute the rest among the others.

527
00:34:50.630 --> 00:34:51.950
So there'll be fewer ways.

528
00:34:51.951 --> 00:34:56.180
The more you put in this one is that clear cause that's really the key concept.

529
00:34:56.540 --> 00:34:58.820
The more bits of energy you put in this one,

530
00:34:59.090 --> 00:35:03.140
the fewer different ways there are of permuting what's left among the others.

531
00:35:03.800 --> 00:35:06.470
Right.
And it's exponential,
right?

532
00:35:07.040 --> 00:35:11.150
So if you have fewer ways among the others,
then it's less likely,
right?

533
00:35:11.630 --> 00:35:13.610
So it turns out that if you do this,

534
00:35:13.611 --> 00:35:18.611
the average energy is one half k t in this degree of freedom,

535
00:35:19.550 --> 00:35:24.550
which is to say that k the Boltzmann constant relates temperature to average

536
00:35:27.171 --> 00:35:28.004
energy,

537
00:35:28.100 --> 00:35:33.100
which is to say that temperature is average energy temperature and average

538
00:35:35.691 --> 00:35:40.160
energy at equilibrium are the same thing.
Okay?

539
00:35:40.460 --> 00:35:42.980
For each degree of freedom you could.
But what,

540
00:35:42.990 --> 00:35:46.520
what did we mean by these little buckets into which we could put energy?

541
00:35:46.730 --> 00:35:49.220
We've met a way of putting energy into the molecule,

542
00:35:49.340 --> 00:35:54.340
like stretching this bond or stretching this bond or bending some bonds or

543
00:35:54.530 --> 00:35:58.640
torsion or something like that.
Now it true,
truly,
you know,

544
00:35:58.641 --> 00:36:03.370
we deal with quantum states,
so you've put energy into different quantum states.

545
00:36:03.420 --> 00:36:07.040
You count up the quantum states to see how likely things are.

546
00:36:09.020 --> 00:36:12.950
Okay.
So that's where the Boltzmann factor is that exponential that he to the

547
00:36:13.790 --> 00:36:15.680
exponential,
uh,

548
00:36:15.740 --> 00:36:20.510
three fourths Delta h comes just because that's what you expect.

549
00:36:20.511 --> 00:36:24.110
If you randomly distribute things,
it'll come out that way.

550
00:36:24.920 --> 00:36:29.090
Now how about the entropy factor?
And this one is fun.
Uh,

551
00:36:29.350 --> 00:36:32.000
Fineman in his wonderful lectures on physics

552
00:36:34.970 --> 00:36:39.970
says it is the change from an ordered arrangement to a disordered arrangement,

553
00:36:40.910 --> 00:36:44.300
which is the source of irreversibility.
Have you heard this?

554
00:36:44.301 --> 00:36:49.301
Said that that entropy is disorder and that you increase Andrew entropy in order

555
00:36:51.291 --> 00:36:53.990
to increase this order.
Okay?
So that's what fine.

556
00:36:53.991 --> 00:36:58.340
But let's say the change from an ordered arrangement do a disordered
arrangement.

557
00:36:59.330 --> 00:37:03.380
Okay.
Now here are two arrangements of the same number of dots,

558
00:37:03.830 --> 00:37:06.470
which one is more ordered left or right.

559
00:37:08.940 --> 00:37:12.090
Okay.
You know,
I'm setting you up,
right?

560
00:37:12.110 --> 00:37:15.440
So your but I know what you would have voted for,
right?

561
00:37:15.950 --> 00:37:18.530
So I'm not going to ask you to vote.
Okay.

562
00:37:18.980 --> 00:37:22.010
But look up the one on the right from a different point of view.

563
00:37:32.260 --> 00:37:33.093
<v 1>Okay.</v>

564
00:37:33.890 --> 00:37:36.950
<v 0>So what do you conclude?
Which one is more ordered?</v>

565
00:37:38.510 --> 00:37:41.840
The one on the right is just as ordered as the one on the left,

566
00:37:42.560 --> 00:37:45.980
but we didn't perceive the order.
Okay.

567
00:37:46.520 --> 00:37:48.200
And that's like constellations,
you know,

568
00:37:48.201 --> 00:37:52.730
the shepherds lay out and saw bears and dragons and things in the sky.

569
00:37:53.480 --> 00:37:56.240
Right.
And thought they were ordered.
Okay.

570
00:37:56.960 --> 00:38:01.340
Now disorder reversibility and COO at flow.
Now I was,

571
00:38:01.400 --> 00:38:03.770
I brought in the experiment to do here and it's,

572
00:38:04.090 --> 00:38:08.480
but I'm not really sure it would work.
So what I'm gonna do,

573
00:38:08.481 --> 00:38:11.200
cause I didn't practice it before I came,
I've done it before,

574
00:38:11.201 --> 00:38:13.640
but I didn't practice it today on my pipette broken.

575
00:38:13.641 --> 00:38:15.470
I had to get a new one made before class.

576
00:38:15.680 --> 00:38:19.100
So if you want to see that come after class and we'll try the actual experiment.

577
00:38:19.340 --> 00:38:23.900
But I'm going to show you a movie of it instead
here.

578
00:38:24.590 --> 00:38:28.820
So this is the same thing here.
What it is is that,
well you'll see in the movie,

579
00:38:29.030 --> 00:38:33.500
I'll just start it up.
Okay.

580
00:38:33.501 --> 00:38:38.230
So it's a,
a glass that goes up inside a glass cylinder.

581
00:38:38.320 --> 00:38:41.590
So there's like a donut inside,
right?

582
00:38:41.740 --> 00:38:44.200
So I'm got to have been a poor kero syrup in there.

583
00:38:44.201 --> 00:38:46.090
I brought the care of Syrup with me to show you.

584
00:38:46.450 --> 00:38:50.620
So it's in that annulus between the rod and the cylinder.

585
00:38:51.730 --> 00:38:55.840
<v 1>Okay.
And now</v>

586
00:38:56.390 --> 00:39:01.390
<v 0>I'm going to take some yellow dye and put a strip of it on.</v>

587
00:39:02.060 --> 00:39:05.180
First I'm going to market so I can tell I'm going to rotate that outside

588
00:39:05.181 --> 00:39:05.631
cylinder.

589
00:39:05.631 --> 00:39:10.631
So you can see that it's rotating and I'm putting a strip of yellow dye between

590
00:39:11.181 --> 00:39:12.530
the rod and the cylinder.

591
00:39:13.130 --> 00:39:17.060
Everybody see what I'm doing and then I'm going to stir it up.

592
00:39:17.660 --> 00:39:21.260
And the way I'm going to stir it is by rotating the outside cylinder.

593
00:39:22.610 --> 00:39:25.940
Okay.
So we'll zoom in and you'll see the watch not very well,

594
00:39:26.210 --> 00:39:30.500
but to show that I'm not just running the movie backward or anything.
Okay.

595
00:39:31.550 --> 00:39:35.540
Okay.
Now I start rotating the downsides.
There's one rotation,

596
00:39:35.570 --> 00:39:39.920
two rotations,
three rotations.
So now it's all mixed up.

597
00:39:40.580 --> 00:39:44.510
And now watch,
I'm on rotating.

598
00:39:47.780 --> 00:39:48.613
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

599
00:39:49.080 --> 00:39:52.170
<v 0>And it comes back.
So if you want to see that happen,</v>

600
00:39:52.171 --> 00:39:53.550
we'll try it after class here.

601
00:39:56.640 --> 00:40:01.290
So you unmixed things that doesn't sound like entropy is working.
Right.

602
00:40:01.980 --> 00:40:02.813
<v 1>Okay.</v>

603
00:40:05.690 --> 00:40:08.330
<v 0>No,
here's,
here's the way it actually happened.</v>

604
00:40:08.360 --> 00:40:12.440
So there was the syrup between the rod and the cylinder looked down from the top

605
00:40:12.680 --> 00:40:17.030
and we put a strip of ink in between and then started rotating.

606
00:40:17.031 --> 00:40:20.840
And as we rotated,
the ink spread out like this.
Right?

607
00:40:20.841 --> 00:40:24.890
Cause the outer part moved and the inner part didn't move where it was in

608
00:40:24.891 --> 00:40:29.330
contact with the Rod.
So after I'd done three rotations that looked like that,

609
00:40:30.230 --> 00:40:33.380
it wasn't really evenly mixed up.

610
00:40:33.530 --> 00:40:36.230
It's just that when we looked at it that looked like it was mixed up.

611
00:40:36.890 --> 00:40:41.030
Right when we looked through it and now when we unrolled state it the whole

612
00:40:41.031 --> 00:40:44.780
thing,
nothing diffused and molecules didn't move at random.

613
00:40:44.781 --> 00:40:46.580
They just got spread out that way,

614
00:40:46.581 --> 00:40:50.000
but in a particular way so it came back again.

615
00:40:51.440 --> 00:40:52.273
<v 1>Okay.</v>

616
00:40:52.570 --> 00:40:56.590
<v 0>So the rotated state only seemed to be disordered.</v>

617
00:40:56.591 --> 00:40:59.110
So that's the basis of the trick.
Right.

618
00:40:59.770 --> 00:41:02.920
But that raises a very fundamental question.

619
00:41:04.560 --> 00:41:04.720
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

620
00:41:04.720 --> 00:41:09.720
<v 0>If disorder is in the mind of the beholder in this case or in the case of that</v>

621
00:41:10.211 --> 00:41:12.370
dinosaur connect the dots,

622
00:41:13.240 --> 00:41:15.880
if disorder is in the mind of the beholder,

623
00:41:16.210 --> 00:41:21.210
how can it beige or a fundamental property like entropy if it depends on who's

624
00:41:21.461 --> 00:41:24.640
looking at it to say whether it's disordered or not.

625
00:41:26.210 --> 00:41:27.043
<v 1>Right.</v>

626
00:41:27.140 --> 00:41:27.741
<v 0>In fact,</v>

627
00:41:27.741 --> 00:41:32.741
a disordered arrangement is an oxymoron because arrangement is and disordered is

628
00:41:34.611 --> 00:41:38.990
not arrangement.
Right.
So how can you have a disordered arrangement?

629
00:41:38.991 --> 00:41:40.580
If the shepherd sees a dragon.

630
00:41:42.230 --> 00:41:43.630
<v 1>Okay.
Okay.</v>

631
00:41:43.820 --> 00:41:46.220
<v 0>The situation favored at equilibrium</v>

632
00:41:47.840 --> 00:41:52.340
by entropy is one where particles have diffused every witch away,

633
00:41:52.430 --> 00:41:57.230
not into a,
into a coiled up piece of paper,

634
00:41:57.231 --> 00:42:01.070
like the yellow thing or not into it,
into a dinosaur.

635
00:42:01.280 --> 00:42:04.250
The every witch away.
The key word is every,

636
00:42:05.540 --> 00:42:07.190
that's what statistical about it.

637
00:42:07.490 --> 00:42:12.490
A disordered arrangement is a code word for a collection of random distributions

638
00:42:13.431 --> 00:42:17.360
whose individual structures are not obvious.
So if the thing looks like a,

639
00:42:17.361 --> 00:42:20.870
you know,
a regular lattice like that,
I say a,
that's irregular lattice.

640
00:42:20.990 --> 00:42:24.470
But if it looks like this,
I don't say it's,
it's exactly that.

641
00:42:24.471 --> 00:42:27.710
I say it's disordered by which I mean I can't tell the difference between that

642
00:42:27.711 --> 00:42:30.290
one and this one or this one or this one.
Right?

643
00:42:30.291 --> 00:42:34.640
So there are a whole bunch of those arrangements that I count together.

644
00:42:34.880 --> 00:42:37.760
When I say disorder,
it's a collective word.

645
00:42:38.090 --> 00:42:40.460
So if all of them were equally likely,

646
00:42:40.730 --> 00:42:44.660
it's much more likely to have disordered many,
many,

647
00:42:44.661 --> 00:42:48.830
many arrangements than the particular ordered ones that we're thinking about,

648
00:42:49.250 --> 00:42:52.160
even if they're all equally likely.
So that's the idea.

649
00:42:52.580 --> 00:42:56.990
It is favored at equilibrium because it includes so many individual

650
00:42:56.991 --> 00:42:57.980
distributions.

651
00:42:58.340 --> 00:43:03.340
So entropy is actually counting in disguise.

652
00:43:04.010 --> 00:43:08.480
You count all these different arrangements are all the different quantum levels

653
00:43:08.600 --> 00:43:12.380
and the more you have under a certain name,

654
00:43:12.770 --> 00:43:15.980
the higher the entropy associated with that name is.

655
00:43:16.670 --> 00:43:17.870
So for example,

656
00:43:17.930 --> 00:43:22.930
a very common value of the entropy difference between two things is 1.377

657
00:43:25.550 --> 00:43:26.870
entropy units.

658
00:43:27.110 --> 00:43:30.680
That seems a weird number right now.

659
00:43:30.681 --> 00:43:35.681
1.377 happens to be our times the natural log of two.

660
00:43:40.430 --> 00:43:45.430
Now consider the difference in entropy between Gauche and anti-beauty.

661
00:43:46.990 --> 00:43:47.823
<v 1>Okay,</v>

662
00:43:48.200 --> 00:43:53.200
<v 0>so the equilibrium constant is e to the minus Delta g over our tea.</v>

663
00:43:53.481 --> 00:43:58.460
Do you remember what g is?
That's the Gibbs free energy,

664
00:43:58.700 --> 00:44:01.940
which includes both heat,
both the kinds of things,

665
00:44:01.941 --> 00:44:06.941
bond energy that we've been talking about and entropy is included in there too.

666
00:44:07.700 --> 00:44:12.050
So we can split it apart into the part that has to do with heat that are

667
00:44:12.051 --> 00:44:15.590
enthalpy,
the Delta h between the two things,
Goshen,

668
00:44:15.650 --> 00:44:20.210
Auntie and t delta s the part that has to do with atrophy.

669
00:44:20.211 --> 00:44:21.740
I suspect you've seen this.

670
00:44:22.670 --> 00:44:26.330
G equals h plus ts before h minus t us before.

671
00:44:27.560 --> 00:44:30.350
But let's just split it apart.
Since they're in the exponent,

672
00:44:30.351 --> 00:44:33.540
we could multiply two things together.
So we have the first part,

673
00:44:33.541 --> 00:44:36.720
the one we've been dealing with,
three fourths Delta H,
right?

674
00:44:37.050 --> 00:44:39.690
And then we have the red part that has to do with entropy,

675
00:44:39.870 --> 00:44:41.370
but you can simplify that.

676
00:44:41.400 --> 00:44:46.400
How can you simplify the part that has to do with entropy at right off the bat?

677
00:44:48.090 --> 00:44:50.160
Cancel the teas.
Okay,

678
00:44:50.161 --> 00:44:55.161
so it's actually delta s over are now suppose that the value of Delta s is our

679
00:44:57.601 --> 00:45:01.050
logged to,
which I said was a very common entropy difference.

680
00:45:01.680 --> 00:45:06.030
Right now you can simplify it further.
Can you see how to simplify it further

681
00:45:07.680 --> 00:45:09.390
for that particular interview difference?

682
00:45:09.870 --> 00:45:14.870
Well obviously the RS cancel and what's he raised to the power of log to too.

683
00:45:17.160 --> 00:45:22.160
So actually what that is is our three fourths Delta h times too.

684
00:45:25.310 --> 00:45:28.320
So when you see 1.377 entropy units,

685
00:45:28.560 --> 00:45:33.060
that's somebody who likes math telling you that there's a factor of two

686
00:45:33.061 --> 00:45:37.710
involved.
That sounds more reasonable.
Right?
To,

687
00:45:38.040 --> 00:45:43.040
why should there be a factor of two that favors Gauche over auntie butane?

688
00:45:47.580 --> 00:45:48.413
Yeah,

689
00:45:49.080 --> 00:45:52.620
there are twice as many goshes is there our aunties?

690
00:45:52.920 --> 00:45:57.360
Cause it could be right handed or left handed goes.
So you'll see what a,

691
00:45:57.420 --> 00:46:01.220
what a crop to this is to see that the entry to say that the attribute

692
00:46:01.221 --> 00:46:05.550
difference between Goshen anti-beauty it is 1.377 entropy units.

693
00:46:05.790 --> 00:46:09.210
It's just that there are twice as many of one of the other,
right.

694
00:46:09.450 --> 00:46:14.450
So that the fact that Delta s occurs in an exponent is just a complicated way of

695
00:46:16.801 --> 00:46:18.870
telling you that there's a statistical factor.

696
00:46:18.871 --> 00:46:22.140
You have to count how many of these things there are.
Okay.

697
00:46:22.141 --> 00:46:24.240
Because you have two Gauche butanes.

698
00:46:25.080 --> 00:46:29.010
So the conclusion that it just means a factor of two and then that the

699
00:46:29.011 --> 00:46:34.011
equilibrium constant depends on temperature because of Delta Age,

700
00:46:34.920 --> 00:46:39.870
not because of Delta s often people think that because the free energy is,

701
00:46:39.930 --> 00:46:41.250
is,
is uh,

702
00:46:41.310 --> 00:46:46.310
h and t s that therefore the entropy thing is changing as t changes.

703
00:46:46.620 --> 00:46:50.610
But in fact that's not true because you divide by t to get anything out of it.

704
00:46:50.611 --> 00:46:52.050
Again.
Right.

705
00:46:52.051 --> 00:46:56.760
So what really changes with temperature is the contribution due to Delta h.

706
00:46:57.330 --> 00:47:02.330
So sometimes that's just used to obscure what is fundamentally very simple.

707
00:47:04.200 --> 00:47:09.180
Okay,
we're gonna stop here and just so everybody's on the same page.

708
00:47:09.430 --> 00:47:11.850
I will have the final lecture on Wednesday,

709
00:47:12.090 --> 00:47:15.150
but then I'll be here at class time on Friday too,

710
00:47:15.240 --> 00:47:19.320
and we can have a discussion then to review for the exam.

711
00:47:19.680 --> 00:47:23.970
And I'm willing to have another one.
I forget.
When did I say on a Monday night.

712
00:47:25.020 --> 00:47:28.890
Now,
do people are,
they're not exams at night,
are there?
Or are,

713
00:47:30.130 --> 00:47:34.120
does anybody have a,
is Monday night?
Okay.
To have the review.

714
00:47:34.330 --> 00:47:36.190
It's probably the best time to have it.

715
00:47:36.700 --> 00:47:40.460
So you have a full day after that before that you say it.
So I'll get a room for,

716
00:47:40.520 --> 00:47:43.900
for next Monday night,
a week from tonight for a review session.
Also,

717
00:47:43.901 --> 00:47:45.580
I'll be here on Friday at lecture time.

718
00:47:46.360 --> 00:47:50.080
So we'll see if anybody wants to see this experiment.
We'll do it.
