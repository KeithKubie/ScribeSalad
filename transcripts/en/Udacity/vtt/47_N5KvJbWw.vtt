00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.749
We get x times the entire quantity y plus z. Both terms in the first expression

00:00:04.749 --> 00:00:09.129
have a factor of x so we can sort of pull an x out of each term, write that as a

00:00:09.129 --> 00:00:14.166
factor that's multiplying two terms inside parenthesis and, of course, these two

00:00:14.166 --> 00:00:18.838
terms which are the terms left over from each of the original terms still have

00:00:18.838 --> 00:00:22.862
the same relationship as these two do. These are added together.
