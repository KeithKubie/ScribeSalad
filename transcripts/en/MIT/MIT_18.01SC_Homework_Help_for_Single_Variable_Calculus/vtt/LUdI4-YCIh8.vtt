00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:07.410
Hi.

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:08.775
Welcome back to recitation.

00:00:08.775 --> 00:00:11.150
We've been talking about a
bunch of different integration

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:11.820
techniques.

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:14.890
Here are a couple of examples on
which you can try and pick out

00:00:14.890 --> 00:00:17.840
the right technique to compute
these two integrals with.

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:21.400
So I've got the first one,
is the indefinite integral

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:24.410
of x cubed times the
square root of the quantity

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:26.880
x squared plus 2 dx.

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:28.640
And the second one is
a definite integral.

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:32.050
It's the integral
1 to e of x squared

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:36.180
times the quantity ln of x
squared, with respect to x.

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:38.190
So why don't you pause
the video, take some time

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:39.930
to compute these two
integrals, come back,

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:41.304
and we can compute
them together.

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:51.100
So hopefully you had some luck
working on these integrals.

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:53.140
Let's start with the first one.

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:56.930
So for question A, let
me just rewrite it here.

00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:02.190
We have the integral of x cubed
times the square root of x

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:06.250
squared plus 2 dx.

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:09.720
Now, if you look at this
integral, what you see

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.870
is a product of two terms.

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:13.250
This term is x cubed.

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:14.110
It's a nice term.

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:16.820
This one is the square
root of x squared plus 2.

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:18.930
That's not such a nice term.

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:22.970
There are a few different things
you might think to try here.

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:25.060
So one thing you
might think to try,

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:27.360
is this square root
of x squared plus 2 is

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:30.300
the sort of thing that shows
up in trig substitutions.

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:32.340
So that's one thing you
might have in your mind.

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.090
Another thing you might
have in your mind,

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:36.129
is that this is a
product of two things.

00:01:36.129 --> 00:01:37.670
So you might consider
the possibility

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:40.070
that you're going to do an
integration by parts here.

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:42.403
And the third thing you might
have in your mind is just,

00:01:42.403 --> 00:01:44.310
you could just-- you
know, this might just

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:46.070
be a substitution situation.

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:49.640
You have this x squared plus 2
as the sort of discrete entity

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:50.560
that shows up there.

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:52.900
So you might try a
regular substitution.

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:57.150
Now you have to, you know, make
a choice among which of these

00:01:57.150 --> 00:01:57.810
to try.

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:01.040
And it seems to me
that of those options,

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:03.420
a regular substitution
is the easiest to do.

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.150
And you'll find
out really quickly

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:09.220
whether you've made your life
horribly complicated or not.

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:11.551
And frequently, with
integration by parts,

00:02:11.551 --> 00:02:14.050
if you have the option of doing
a substitution when you have

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:16.640
integration by parts, you
know, it won't-- if you do

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:18.980
the substitution, you still
can do integration by parts

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:19.480
afterward.

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:21.130
If you do integration
by parts first,

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:24.490
you can still do the
substitution afterward.

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:28.534
So trying the substitution
shouldn't hurt us

00:02:28.534 --> 00:02:30.700
for integration by parts,
and a regular substitution

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:33.540
will be a lot simpler than a
trig substitution here, right?

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:35.590
Trig substitutions in
general are complicated,

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:38.089
so it's a good idea to see if
there's something simpler that

00:02:38.089 --> 00:02:39.190
can be done first.

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:41.230
So if we're going to try
regular substitution,

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:44.120
the sort of natural
thing to do, is

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:48.230
to set u equal x squared plus 2.

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:55.302
So in this case, we have
du is equal to 2x dx.

00:02:58.210 --> 00:02:59.730
Or-- well, so OK.

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:02.720
So we want to substitute
these things in.

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:05.570
The u is going to go into
the square root term.

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:07.070
So that's going to
be taken care of.

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:10.150
And the dx part--
well, we've got an x

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:14.890
here to pair up with the dx, so
that's going to give us a du.

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:16.800
And then we'll have
x squared left over.

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:19.960
So we'll need to substitute
in for x squared.

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:24.910
So we're going to use x
squared is equal to u minus 2,

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:31.340
and x dx is equal to du over 2.

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:34.050
So when we make these
substitutions in here, what

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:37.400
we get is that this integral
is equal to the integral

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:40.930
of-- so it's x squared times
the square root of x squared

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:42.820
plus 2 times x dx.

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:46.960
So that's u minus 2
times the square root

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:52.420
of u times du over 2.

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:54.737
Now, having made the
substitution, we see-- OK.

00:03:54.737 --> 00:03:56.320
So with a little bit
of rearrangement,

00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:58.110
this is just a sum
of powers of u.

00:03:58.110 --> 00:03:58.610
Right?

00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:06.720
We can rewrite this as the
integral of u to the 3/2 over 2

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:11.185
minus u to the 1/2 du.

00:04:11.185 --> 00:04:13.310
And now, this is just
straightforward to integrate.

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:15.090
So it turns out we don't
need integration by parts.

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:16.630
We don't need a
trig substitution.

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:18.730
Just this regular
substitution works nicely.

00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:21.900
So we get, well, u
to the 3/2, so we

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:27.190
compute an antiderivative, so
that gives us u to the 5/2.

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:31.540
And I have to divide by 5/2,
so I have to multiply by 2/5.

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:32.510
And then I have a half.

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:38.240
So it's u to the 5/2 over
5, minus-- so u to the 1/2,

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:46.961
so that gives me 3/2, so I
need minus 2/3 u to the 3/2.

00:04:46.961 --> 00:04:47.460
OK.

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:49.150
And now to finish
this off, I have

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:51.540
to do my final
back substitution,

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:53.890
and replace u with x.

00:04:53.890 --> 00:05:01.500
So this is going to be
x squared plus 2 over 5

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:10.750
to the 5/2 minus 2/3 times
x squared plus 2 to the 3/2.

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:12.060
All right.

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:13.160
Plus a constant.

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:15.780
Thank you, peanut gallery.

00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:16.460
Plus a constant.

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:17.260
Right.

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:18.990
Indefinite integral,
should have had it

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:21.180
right the very first
time I went through.

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:22.660
Plus a constant, both times.

00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:23.160
OK.

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:23.660
Good.

00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:26.770
So that's all there
is for part A. Now

00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:28.770
let's look at part B. So OK.

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:31.680
So part B is a little
more complicated-looking.

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:34.880
Let me copy it over here again.

00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:40.220
So part B, we have the
integral from 1 to e

00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:47.950
of x squared times the
quantity ln x squared dx.

00:05:47.950 --> 00:05:50.770
So again, there are a couple
of possibilities for what

00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:52.680
we could want to do here.

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:57.090
One thing is you could try
just a regular substitution.

00:05:57.090 --> 00:05:58.840
So maybe a regular
substitution you

00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:04.760
might want to try is u equals
ln of x, or x equals e to the u.

00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:07.330
And now if you try that, you
can try it, and what you'll see,

00:06:07.330 --> 00:06:08.500
is you'll get something.

00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:12.319
So here we have a
polynomial times a function

00:06:12.319 --> 00:06:14.110
of the logarithm, a
power of the logarithm.

00:06:14.110 --> 00:06:16.318
If you try that substitution,
what you'll end up with

00:06:16.318 --> 00:06:21.461
is a polynomial in u
times an exponential in u.

00:06:21.461 --> 00:06:21.960
So OK.

00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:25.650
So it's not clear that
we've won anything,

00:06:25.650 --> 00:06:28.080
if we make that substitution.

00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:30.407
The other thing we can try,
is we can try integration

00:06:30.407 --> 00:06:30.990
by parts here.

00:06:30.990 --> 00:06:33.944
Again, we have a product form.

00:06:33.944 --> 00:06:35.360
And if you make
that substitution,

00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:37.380
you get polynomial
times exponential,

00:06:37.380 --> 00:06:39.990
and that's also a promising
place for integration by parts,

00:06:39.990 --> 00:06:41.620
after the substitution.

00:06:41.620 --> 00:06:42.240
So OK.

00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:43.990
So I'm not going to
make the substitution.

00:06:43.990 --> 00:06:46.607
I'm just going to go--
seeing this product,

00:06:46.607 --> 00:06:48.690
I'm going to go for
integration by parts directly.

00:06:48.690 --> 00:06:51.990
So I need to decide what pieces
are which for integration

00:06:51.990 --> 00:06:52.580
by parts.

00:06:52.580 --> 00:06:54.105
And the thing to
remember is this

00:06:54.105 --> 00:06:56.120
that-- so I have here
a polynomial times

00:06:56.120 --> 00:06:57.616
a function of the logarithm.

00:06:57.616 --> 00:06:59.490
And the thing to remember
is that polynomials

00:06:59.490 --> 00:07:00.851
like to be differentiated.

00:07:00.851 --> 00:07:01.850
That's their preference.

00:07:01.850 --> 00:07:05.117
But logarithms really, really
like to be differentiated.

00:07:05.117 --> 00:07:07.700
You'd much rather differentiate
a logarithm than integrate it.

00:07:07.700 --> 00:07:09.400
You can integrate a
polynomial-- I mean you

00:07:09.400 --> 00:07:10.608
can integrate either of them.

00:07:10.608 --> 00:07:12.730
You can integrate a polynomial.

00:07:12.730 --> 00:07:14.230
When you integrate
a polynomial, you

00:07:14.230 --> 00:07:17.030
get something that's still
a fairly nice polynomial.

00:07:17.030 --> 00:07:18.810
Integrating
logarithms is harder,

00:07:18.810 --> 00:07:20.840
whereas differentiating
logarithms makes them

00:07:20.840 --> 00:07:22.610
into just powers of x.

00:07:22.610 --> 00:07:27.346
So setting this up as
an integration by parts,

00:07:27.346 --> 00:07:28.720
we're going to
want to take this,

00:07:28.720 --> 00:07:30.670
the everything with
the logarithm in it,

00:07:30.670 --> 00:07:33.010
and that's the piece we
want to differentiate,

00:07:33.010 --> 00:07:34.270
to try and simplify it.

00:07:34.270 --> 00:07:36.340
So that's going
to be our u part.

00:07:36.340 --> 00:07:43.330
So we're going to try
u equals ln x squared,

00:07:43.330 --> 00:07:49.450
and that leaves v
prime to be x squared.

00:07:49.450 --> 00:07:50.980
So to do integration
by parts-- OK.

00:07:50.980 --> 00:07:53.063
We need to differentiate
and we need to integrate.

00:07:53.063 --> 00:07:57.180
So if I differentiate ln
x squared, I get u prime.

00:07:57.180 --> 00:07:59.144
The prime is equal to-- OK.

00:07:59.144 --> 00:08:00.560
Well, this is a
little chain rule.

00:08:00.560 --> 00:08:04.040
So it's 2 ln x times
the derivative of ln

00:08:04.040 --> 00:08:06.120
x, which is 1 over x.

00:08:06.120 --> 00:08:08.900
And if I integrate
v prime, I get

00:08:08.900 --> 00:08:13.901
v is equal to x cubed over 3.

00:08:13.901 --> 00:08:14.400
OK.

00:08:14.400 --> 00:08:18.370
So now I use the formula
for integration by parts.

00:08:18.370 --> 00:08:23.130
So I have that this integral--
what I'm going to do is

00:08:23.130 --> 00:08:25.802
I'm going to call this,
let me give it a name, I.

00:08:25.802 --> 00:08:28.010
Now I'm going to come down
here and I'm going to say,

00:08:28.010 --> 00:08:31.680
I is equal to-- well,
by integration by parts,

00:08:31.680 --> 00:08:38.350
it's equal to u*v minus the
integral of u prime v dx.

00:08:38.350 --> 00:08:47.910
So in our case, u*v is x cubed
over 3 times ln x squared.

00:08:47.910 --> 00:08:50.350
But the thing to remember is,
this was a definite integral

00:08:50.350 --> 00:08:51.100
to start out with.

00:08:51.100 --> 00:08:52.050
It's from 1 to e.

00:08:52.050 --> 00:08:53.620
So when you take
this part out front,

00:08:53.620 --> 00:08:56.440
you have to take the
difference of its two values.

00:08:56.440 --> 00:09:00.720
So we're going to evaluate
this between x equals 1

00:09:00.720 --> 00:09:05.010
and x equals e, minus
the definite integral--

00:09:05.010 --> 00:09:07.440
so we still have a definite
integral from one to e

00:09:07.440 --> 00:09:13.740
of u prime v. So
that's 2/3-- OK.

00:09:13.740 --> 00:09:17.730
So now we have an ln x
over x times x cubed.

00:09:17.730 --> 00:09:20.490
So the x and the x cubed,
that cancels one power

00:09:20.490 --> 00:09:23.030
of x out of the numerator.

00:09:23.030 --> 00:09:30.930
So we're left with
2/3 x squared ln x dx.

00:09:30.930 --> 00:09:32.415
So.

00:09:32.415 --> 00:09:33.914
One thing we see,
this is just going

00:09:33.914 --> 00:09:35.790
to be-- this is just going
to evaluate to a constant.

00:09:35.790 --> 00:09:37.570
We're going to plug in e,
and we're going to plug in 1,

00:09:37.570 --> 00:09:39.195
and we're going to
take the difference.

00:09:39.195 --> 00:09:40.500
So that's just some number.

00:09:40.500 --> 00:09:42.560
This part is still
some integral.

00:09:42.560 --> 00:09:43.450
Are we done yet?

00:09:43.450 --> 00:09:47.070
Well, it's not obvious
immediately how

00:09:47.070 --> 00:09:47.890
to integrate this.

00:09:47.890 --> 00:09:50.210
I mean, I don't already
know off the top of my head

00:09:50.210 --> 00:09:53.064
what the antiderivative here is.

00:09:53.064 --> 00:09:54.480
On the other hand,
it's definitely

00:09:54.480 --> 00:09:56.240
simpler than what we
started with, right?

00:09:56.240 --> 00:09:58.630
Before we had x
squared ln x squared.

00:09:58.630 --> 00:10:00.270
Here we just have
x squared ln x.

00:10:00.270 --> 00:10:03.840
So we've simplified
the integrand.

00:10:03.840 --> 00:10:06.800
And it's still in a form in
which we can further integrate

00:10:06.800 --> 00:10:08.550
by parts, if you wanted to.

00:10:08.550 --> 00:10:09.050
Right?

00:10:09.050 --> 00:10:11.907
So now in this case
the natural thing to do

00:10:11.907 --> 00:10:13.740
would be very similar
to what we did before.

00:10:13.740 --> 00:10:15.701
We're going to take
the u to be the ln

00:10:15.701 --> 00:10:17.200
x, to be the piece
we differentiate,

00:10:17.200 --> 00:10:19.355
and we're going to take
the v to be x squared.

00:10:19.355 --> 00:10:21.360
OK?

00:10:21.360 --> 00:10:22.110
So we can do that.

00:10:22.110 --> 00:10:24.310
So this is equal to-- let's see.

00:10:24.310 --> 00:10:27.590
I'm going to bring
it, now, upstairs.

00:10:27.590 --> 00:10:28.930
So this is equal to-- all right.

00:10:28.930 --> 00:10:30.600
So we plug in e here.

00:10:30.600 --> 00:10:35.310
We get e cubed over 3 times
1, minus when we plug in 1,

00:10:35.310 --> 00:10:36.770
ln of 1 is 0.

00:10:36.770 --> 00:10:39.810
So that just gives
me e cubed over 3

00:10:39.810 --> 00:10:42.200
for the first part
minus-- all right,

00:10:42.200 --> 00:10:44.470
and I'm going to pull
the 2/3 out front.

00:10:44.470 --> 00:10:47.650
So it's minus 2/3 times--

00:10:47.650 --> 00:10:48.150
OK.

00:10:48.150 --> 00:10:49.976
So now I'm going to
do an integration

00:10:49.976 --> 00:10:50.850
by parts on this one.

00:10:50.850 --> 00:10:56.860
So again, like I said, I'm going
to take u is equal to ln x.

00:10:56.860 --> 00:11:01.690
I'm going to take v prime
is equal to x squared.

00:11:01.690 --> 00:11:05.510
So that means u
prime is equal to 1

00:11:05.510 --> 00:11:13.190
over x and v is equal
to x cubed over 3.

00:11:13.190 --> 00:11:20.404
And so again, I get uv,
which is x cubed over 3 ln x,

00:11:20.404 --> 00:11:22.320
and again, because it
was a definite integral,

00:11:22.320 --> 00:11:28.930
I have to evaluate this between
x equals 1 and e, minus-- OK.

00:11:28.930 --> 00:11:31.580
So minus the integral
of u prime v.

00:11:31.580 --> 00:11:34.050
So this is the
integral from 1 to e.

00:11:34.050 --> 00:11:36.560
u prime v is 1 over x
times x cubed over 3,

00:11:36.560 --> 00:11:43.070
so that's x squared over 3 dx.

00:11:43.070 --> 00:11:45.345
OK, so having written all
that down, what you see

00:11:45.345 --> 00:11:47.440
is this is a constant minus 2/3.

00:11:47.440 --> 00:11:47.940
OK.

00:11:47.940 --> 00:11:48.860
This is just some constant.

00:11:48.860 --> 00:11:50.250
We'll plug in e,
we'll plug in 1.

00:11:50.250 --> 00:11:50.920
That's easy.

00:11:50.920 --> 00:11:53.500
And now we have an integral,
and we've reduced this finally.

00:11:53.500 --> 00:11:55.699
Here we have just an
integral of a polynomial.

00:11:55.699 --> 00:11:57.990
So an integral of a polynomial,
that's easy to compute,

00:11:57.990 --> 00:11:59.900
you can do it yourself.

00:11:59.900 --> 00:12:03.830
And I'm going to let you finish
off the last couple of steps

00:12:03.830 --> 00:12:04.820
for yourself.

00:12:04.820 --> 00:12:07.540
In the end, the
answer should work out

00:12:07.540 --> 00:12:19.900
to 5 e cubed over
27 minus 2 over 27.

00:12:19.900 --> 00:12:22.140
This is what you should
find the final answer

00:12:22.140 --> 00:12:23.580
to be when you work it all out.

00:12:23.580 --> 00:12:25.420
So I'll end there.
