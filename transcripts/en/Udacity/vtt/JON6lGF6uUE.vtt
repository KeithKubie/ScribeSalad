00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:03.328
Storing our friends in an ArrayList instead of a string made it easier for us

00:00:03.328 --> 00:00:07.967
to add some useful features. Now friends can have spaces in their names and I

00:00:07.967 --> 00:00:11.710
can have multiple friends with the same name. It's easy to answer questions

00:00:11.710 --> 00:00:16.149
like, how many friends does someone have or who is the fifth friend on my list?

00:00:16.149 --> 00:00:19.872
But you may have noticed that we haven't touched the un-friend method. For that

00:00:19.872 --> 00:00:24.370
we would need to modify the ArrayList, back to Cay to tell us how to do that.
