Congress in Washington, D.C.

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:28.350
&gt;&gt; Lee Ann Potter: How
many of you like cats?

00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:30.630
Okay, now we're getting somewhere.

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:32.450
Okay, how many of you
like chocolate?

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:33.750
I knew that one, I'm telling you.

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:36.850
How many of you know
where California is?

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:38.390
Okay. How many of you have ever --

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:42.060
okay, this is a really
important one.

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:48.300
How many of you have ever
gone to your school library

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:53.930
or public library, and --
and come home with a stack

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:57.010
of books at least this big.

00:00:57.010 --> 00:00:58.310
[ Kids Chattering, Yelling ]

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:00.730
All right, see I knew it.

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:02.800
See, I figured that with
all of those questions,

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:06.560
I would come up with at
least one where I could say,

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:09.790
you guys all have something
in common

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:12.740
with our very special guest today.

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:14.040
&gt;&gt; Jeanne Walker Harvey: Wow.

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:15.370
That is wonderful.

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:18.160
&gt;&gt; Lee Ann Potter: So, Jeanne is
here to visit with us this morning

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:21.470
about her new book about Mya Lin.

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:23.930
And not only has Jeanne
written a book about Mya Lin,

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:29.890
but she's also written books about
other artists, and about animals.

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:32.500
So, the floor is yours.

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:33.800
&gt;&gt; Jeanne Walker Harvey: Great.

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:35.100
Thank you.

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:36.400
&gt;&gt; Lee Ann Potter: Thank
you so much for being here.

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:37.700
&gt;&gt; Jeanne Walker Harvey:
Appreciate that was really nice.

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:39.000
&gt;&gt; Lee Ann Potter:
[inaudible] Thank you.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.300
&gt;&gt; Jean Walker Harvey:
So, welcome everyone.

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:41.600
I can't tell you how
excited I am to be here,

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:44.560
I could hardly sleep last
night, I was so excited.

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:48.990
The Library of Congress,
that's like, the best library.

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:54.560
So, I live across the
country in California.

00:01:54.560 --> 00:02:02.510
And I flew across last night, and
my cat, her name is Ally, she said,

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:06.160
"Will you please be sure
to say hello to everyone?"

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:09.210
So, will you please
say hello back to Ally

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:12.140 position:56%
when I count to three really loudly?

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:13.440
Her name's Ally.

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:15.900
One, two, three.

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:17.200
&gt;&gt; Hello, Ally!

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:18.880
&gt;&gt; Jean Walker Harvey: Hello, Ally!

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:22.470
Oh, wonderful, because she gets
a little jealous because most

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:27.270
of the time when I'm writing
she's sitting on my lap.

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:31.650
So, I told her she couldn't be part
of the slide show though, so --

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:33.730
but I will tell her you said hello.

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:36.960
So, anyways, what I'm going to
tell you today is a little bit

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:40.560
of my background of
why I'm a writer.

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:45.390
What inspired me, and
why I wrote this book?

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:50.850
What inspired me to write the book,
and I want to hear about your ideas

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:52.670
after I read the book too.

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:56.970
so, I'm just going to run through
a few things about my background.

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:03.040
So, that's me with my grandmother,

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:05.500
and she got me excited
about writing.

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:08.730
I would write a little bit
of a story, mail it to her,

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:12.060
and she would add to the story,
and then she'd mail it back to me,

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:14.980
so we'd make long stories together.

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:21.400
And when I was in first
grade I moved to California

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:25.840
to Illinois right near Disneyland.

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:29.340
I know, so I got to go to
Disneyland, and that made me think

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:35.730 position:56%
about stories all about those Disney
characters, and that magic castle.

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:39.190
And the Matterhorn, and all the --

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:43.250
I just made my imagination,
my creativity went wild.

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:46.310
There I am with my mom
when I'm there in --

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:49.380
I think I was probably second
grade then in that photo,

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:51.970
looking out at Disneyland.

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:58.110
And what I loved, and my mom taught
me to love is everything modern.

00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:00.610
Raise your hand if you
know what modern means?

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:02.910
Yes?

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:08.120
What do you think modern -- it's
kind of a wild word isn't it?

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:09.420
Think about it.

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:12.050
Do yo want to think about it?

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:13.350
&gt;&gt; Design.

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:16.410
&gt;&gt; Jean Walker Harvey: Design,
yeah, modern design, yes?

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:18.990
&gt;&gt; I think it means normal?

00:04:18.990 --> 00:04:20.880 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Jean Walker Harvey: Normal, okay.

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:22.180
Yeah.

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:27.090
&gt;&gt; I think it means
like, when you're good?

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:29.000
&gt;&gt; Jean Walker Harvey: Okay,
I love all these ideas.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:33.050
Modern is when -- is part of
design and it is sort of a normal,

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:36.960
because it's what current,
what's new ideas.

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:41.220
So, think modern as
like, new -- new ideas.

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:45.320
So, when -- so, there's
my dad at work,

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:48.550
and he had very modern
furniture for the time.

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:51.130
And that big painting
behind him, my mom painted,

00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:55.480
because she loved to
paint modern art.

00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:58.740
So, that's where I started
learning about modern art,

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:02.950
and I went to the Museum
of Art in Los Angeles.

00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:07.190
That was my library that I
went to, and as she was saying,

00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:10.670
I would come home with
a big stack of books.

00:05:10.670 --> 00:05:14.290
And my mom would come home with
a big, heavy stack of books,

00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:18.350
because that would be art books,
she'd get really big art books,

00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:20.790
and I'd go to more museums.

00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:27.220
Well, fast-forward to when I was
in college, so, I was in college

00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:34.180
in California over where the star
is, and I read a newspaper article,

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:41.980 position:56%
a press clipping that said someone
from across the country the same age

00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:44.970
as I was, and her name is --

00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:48.340
Can you say that name?

00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:49.640
Mya Lin?

00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:50.940
&gt;&gt; Mya Lin.

00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:52.240
&gt;&gt; Jean Walker Harvey: Mya Lin.

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:59.900
So, she won a contest, and so, she
was just my age, she was a senior

00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:03.310
in college, and she won a contest

00:06:03.310 --> 00:06:07.810
to design the Vietnam
Veterans Memorial right here

00:06:07.810 --> 00:06:11.620
in Washington D.C. And I
thought, well, that is so cool,

00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:14.100
I want to learn more about that.

00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:21.440 position:56%
So, there's a photo of her, and
she's holding the design that she --

00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:25.470
she made a model, and she mailed
this in, and she won this contest.

00:06:25.470 --> 00:06:29.310
And look at that, that's right
here, this is from the Library

00:06:29.310 --> 00:06:30.940
of Congress, this is right here.

00:06:30.940 --> 00:06:37.250
It's so cool, so cool, the original
one is right here in this building.

00:06:37.250 --> 00:06:41.540
So, she had designed --
has anyone been there?

00:06:41.540 --> 00:06:43.310
Does that ring a bell?

00:06:43.310 --> 00:06:46.150
Does that -- do you recognize that?

00:06:46.150 --> 00:06:48.960
Maybe you've been there,
maybe you will go there.

00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:53.290
So, she -- so, here
is more photos of it.

00:06:53.290 --> 00:07:00.280
So, she, for this contest needed to
include all the names of soldiers

00:07:00.280 --> 00:07:03.140 position:56%
who had died during the Vietnam War.

00:07:03.140 --> 00:07:07.570
So, the whole wall is covered
with names, it's a very powerful,

00:07:07.570 --> 00:07:09.290
very touching place to visit.

00:07:09.290 --> 00:07:16.780
And here she is very excited
that she won this design contest,

00:07:16.780 --> 00:07:20.070
but people all didn't
like the design.

00:07:20.070 --> 00:07:24.810
So, there she is also at a
hearing right here in -- the --

00:07:24.810 --> 00:07:27.430
in Congress, right
across the street.

00:07:27.430 --> 00:07:31.630
And they -- she looks
pretty serious, doesn't she,

00:07:31.630 --> 00:07:33.790
because people were saying,
"Mm, I don't think we

00:07:33.790 --> 00:07:35.700
like the design that you did."

00:07:35.700 --> 00:07:42.240
But, she said, no, it's a really
important way to show how we care

00:07:42.240 --> 00:07:46.010
for our soldiers who have fallen.

00:07:46.010 --> 00:07:50.800
So, she kept with her ideas, and so
I thought, I want to write a book

00:07:50.800 --> 00:07:53.510
about her, because
she's so interesting,

00:07:53.510 --> 00:07:55.480
and such a strong person.

00:07:55.480 --> 00:08:00.030
So, I read about her, I
watched videos about her,

00:08:00.030 --> 00:08:04.640
I listened to her talk on the
-- yeah, music would be good.

00:08:04.640 --> 00:08:07.620
I listened to music of the
time, that's a good idea,

00:08:07.620 --> 00:08:10.120
that gives you an idea,
a lot of the music.

00:08:10.120 --> 00:08:14.720
And so, that's her as a little
girl, her parents came from China,

00:08:14.720 --> 00:08:18.010
so there's her parents,
and they were both teachers

00:08:18.010 --> 00:08:22.260
in -- of art and poetry.

00:08:22.260 --> 00:08:25.940
So, she lived in a house
with lots of art and music.

00:08:25.940 --> 00:08:30.490
We already talked beforehand, a
lot of you like music and art too.

00:08:30.490 --> 00:08:35.360 position:56%
And that's her father, you can see
he did interesting things with clay.

00:08:35.360 --> 00:08:37.930
Has anyone made anything
with clay before?

00:08:37.930 --> 00:08:41.650
Yeah, it's a nice feeling isn't
it, you sort of design things.

00:08:41.650 --> 00:08:45.190
And so, she watched her father
making clay, and she said,

00:08:45.190 --> 00:08:47.800
"That really" -- that
idea stayed with her,

00:08:47.800 --> 00:08:50.220
the idea of how you
create something.

00:08:50.220 --> 00:08:54.690
It's just a big blob of clay, but
then you create something beautiful

00:08:54.690 --> 00:08:57.360
with your hands, and that's
the house where she lived.

00:08:57.360 --> 00:09:00.170
And you can see there's
trees around it, and that --

00:09:00.170 --> 00:09:05.880 position:56%
she really loves nature, and she
still -- she lives in New York City,

00:09:05.880 --> 00:09:11.160
and right now she's doing lots of
projects involving the environment,

00:09:11.160 --> 00:09:14.590
because she cares so
much about nature.

00:09:14.590 --> 00:09:17.820
So, what I did is I
started researching,

00:09:17.820 --> 00:09:19.770
learning, reading books.

00:09:19.770 --> 00:09:23.500 position:56%
And these are some of the books, you
can see lots of books, and -- oh!

00:09:23.500 --> 00:09:24.800
&gt;&gt; There's Ally.

00:09:24.800 --> 00:09:27.950
&gt;&gt; Jean Walker Harvey: Did she
sneak herself into my slideshow?

00:09:27.950 --> 00:09:32.900
That little sneaky kitty, do any
of you have sneaky animals at home?

00:09:32.900 --> 00:09:34.200
&gt;&gt; No.

00:09:34.200 --> 00:09:35.500
&gt;&gt; Jean Walker Harvey: Yeah.

00:09:35.500 --> 00:09:38.860
Yeah. Okay, so this is my cat
Ally, I think she looks very happy

00:09:38.860 --> 00:09:41.600
that you all said hello
earlier, that was very nice.

00:09:41.600 --> 00:09:43.070
&gt;&gt; Hello, Ally.

00:09:43.070 --> 00:09:45.060
&gt;&gt; Jean Walker Harvey: So, you can
see what she does, when I'm trying

00:09:45.060 --> 00:09:50.430
to work she gets right in-between
me and the laptop, so I can't type,

00:09:50.430 --> 00:09:52.410 position:56%
and she says, "I need to be petted."

00:09:52.410 --> 00:09:56.510
So, anyway, she does help me a lot,
and what she was really excited

00:09:56.510 --> 00:10:02.770
to learn was Mya Lin, she --
her cat helps her work too.

00:10:02.770 --> 00:10:06.460
So, there's Mya Lin, the book
that I'm going to read to you

00:10:06.460 --> 00:10:09.360
and her cat, and her cat's
sitting right on her paper,

00:10:09.360 --> 00:10:11.590
it's just like she does with me.

00:10:11.590 --> 00:10:14.400
So, that -- you can see her.

00:10:14.400 --> 00:10:19.350
So, Mya Lin is what we
call an architect artist.

00:10:19.350 --> 00:10:22.410
So, an architect's someone
who builds buildings,

00:10:22.410 --> 00:10:24.870
and then, but also makes art.

00:10:24.870 --> 00:10:28.110
So, here I wrote the words, and
have any of you written something,

00:10:28.110 --> 00:10:32.970 position:56%
your teacher gives it back to you,
and says -- with some changes on it?

00:10:32.970 --> 00:10:35.360
Yeah. So, that's what that is,

00:10:35.360 --> 00:10:37.770
and that's how we can get our
writing better and better,

00:10:37.770 --> 00:10:40.470
because we're asked to do changes.

00:10:40.470 --> 00:10:45.840
And then, when the book became
-- was going to become a story,

00:10:45.840 --> 00:10:49.510
then we found someone to draw
the pictures, the illustrator.

00:10:49.510 --> 00:10:52.950
And her name is Dow
Phumiruk, and here are some

00:10:52.950 --> 00:10:56.350
of her pictures that she does.

00:10:56.350 --> 00:10:59.400
And there's the book, and
you can see how it's changed.

00:10:59.400 --> 00:11:01.270
Yeah, see, this is
the way it is now,

00:11:01.270 --> 00:11:04.770
but first she drew the
cover in a different way.

00:11:04.770 --> 00:11:06.070
Oh, you know what?

00:11:06.070 --> 00:11:09.770
That's inside the story,
yes, it is inside,

00:11:09.770 --> 00:11:13.480
and that where the yellow square
is, if you look really carefully

00:11:13.480 --> 00:11:16.240 position:56%
in your book, and I get to be in it.

00:11:16.240 --> 00:11:19.660
So, she put me in the
book, isn't that nice?

00:11:19.660 --> 00:11:21.590
&gt;&gt; Why did she put you in the book?

00:11:21.590 --> 00:11:23.160
&gt;&gt; Jean Walker Harvey: She
was just being nice, she said,

00:11:23.160 --> 00:11:26.050
"I think I should put you
in the book as a visitor

00:11:26.050 --> 00:11:30.030
at the memorial", so
that was very nice.

00:11:30.030 --> 00:11:33.850
And then, she wrote me
a letter, and My Lin --

00:11:33.850 --> 00:11:35.150
&gt;&gt; Can you read it?

00:11:35.150 --> 00:11:36.710
&gt;&gt; Jean Walker Harvey: Yeah,
I'm going to read it right now.

00:11:36.710 --> 00:11:40.300
And Mya Lin wrote me a letter, and
said, "I really like your book.

00:11:40.300 --> 00:11:42.910
I like your words, and
I like your pictures",

00:11:42.910 --> 00:11:47.440
and that me feel very good, because
I had tried -- it's about her life.

00:11:47.440 --> 00:11:50.210
If someone wrote a book about
you, you'd want to be sure

00:11:50.210 --> 00:11:51.910
that it was what you liked.

00:11:51.910 --> 00:11:55.730
Yeah, thumbs up, exactly.

00:11:55.730 --> 00:12:00.200
So, let's read the book.

00:12:00.200 --> 00:12:03.170
Okay. Okay, Mya Lin,
say her name again.

00:12:03.170 --> 00:12:04.550
&gt;&gt; Mya Lin.

00:12:04.550 --> 00:12:06.200
&gt;&gt; Jean Walker Harvey: Thank you.

00:12:06.200 --> 00:12:08.640
Artist, architect,
of light and lines,

00:12:08.640 --> 00:12:11.970
designer of the Vietnam
Veterans Memorial.

00:12:14.310 --> 00:12:18.950 position:56%
And there's the cover inside, and
there's her house where she grew up.

00:12:18.950 --> 00:12:25.370
In the woods by her childhood home,
Mya Lin played with her brother,

00:12:25.370 --> 00:12:29.470
and explored and climbed
the many rolling hills,

00:12:29.470 --> 00:12:35.170
one she named the Lizard's Back.

00:12:35.170 --> 00:12:41.010
On long walks alone, she
searched for birds in the forest,

00:12:41.010 --> 00:12:43.760
Mya sat still as a statue.

00:12:43.760 --> 00:12:46.480
Can you sit still as a statue?

00:12:46.480 --> 00:12:50.110
&gt;&gt; [inaudible]

00:12:50.110 --> 00:12:52.850
&gt;&gt; Jean Walker Harvey: Hoping
to tame rabbits, raccoons,

00:12:52.850 --> 00:12:55.480
chipmunks, and squirrels.

00:12:55.480 --> 00:12:58.850
Aww, she was very quiet.

00:13:03.100 --> 00:13:08.790
In her house full of light and
open spaces, Mya read books,

00:13:08.790 --> 00:13:11.690
and played chess with her brother.

00:13:11.690 --> 00:13:17.630
And with paper and scraps
she built tiny towns.

00:13:17.630 --> 00:13:24.030
Her parents had fled China, so
they had left China at a time

00:13:24.030 --> 00:13:28.170
when people were told what
to be, and how to think.

00:13:28.170 --> 00:13:36.000
Her parents never told Mya
what to be or how to think.

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:43.000 position:56%
Mya grew up with art, her father was
an artist who made art with clay.

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:48.210
Her mother was a poet
who made art with words.

00:13:48.210 --> 00:13:54.730
She watched her father form
a pot from a mound of clay

00:13:54.730 --> 00:13:57.440
without plans or drawings.

00:13:57.440 --> 00:14:02.610
Mya too thought with her
hands, as well as her mind.

00:14:02.610 --> 00:14:07.770
One day when Mya looked at the
patterns of light and lines

00:14:07.770 --> 00:14:10.260
on the ceiling of her
college library,

00:14:10.260 --> 00:14:16.810
she imagined she would become an
architect who created buildings

00:14:16.810 --> 00:14:20.440
with art, science, and math.

00:14:24.580 --> 00:14:28.090
While studying overseas, Mya
wondered through countries

00:14:28.090 --> 00:14:31.120
and cities gazing at
buildings of all types,

00:14:31.120 --> 00:14:35.970 position:56%
new and old, learning all she could.

00:14:35.970 --> 00:14:40.630
In her last year of college,
Mya entered a contest

00:14:40.630 --> 00:14:43.440
to design a memorial
to honor soldiers

00:14:43.440 --> 00:14:46.670
who died during the Vietnam War.

00:14:46.670 --> 00:14:51.190
The contest rules said the memorial
must blend with a park setting,

00:14:51.190 --> 00:14:54.520
and include the name of every
soldier who died fighting

00:14:54.520 --> 00:15:03.260
or was missing, almost
58,000 names, mm-hmm.

00:15:03.260 --> 00:15:09.660
These rules rang true to Mya,
she knew the power of names.

00:15:09.660 --> 00:15:16.280 position:56%
Mya believed that a name brings back
all the memories of a person more

00:15:16.280 --> 00:15:21.460
than a photo of a moment in time.

00:15:21.460 --> 00:15:25.680
In the glow of the autumn sun,
Mya walked across a field dotted

00:15:25.680 --> 00:15:29.110
with trees, the site
of the future memorial.

00:15:29.110 --> 00:15:33.880
Through her camera's eye,
she imagined a knife slicing

00:15:33.880 --> 00:15:38.720
through open -- the -- a
knife slicing open the earth.

00:15:38.720 --> 00:15:44.250
And in her mind, she saw the cut
in the earth healing over time

00:15:44.250 --> 00:15:49.530
to a polished edge covered
from top to bottom with names.

00:15:49.530 --> 00:15:53.700
An edge that reflected sky,
and grass, and the people

00:15:53.700 --> 00:15:56.000
who visited the memorial.

00:16:01.240 --> 00:16:07.580
Back at school, Mya sculpted
a model with mashed potatoes.

00:16:07.580 --> 00:16:10.210
Yeah, mashed potatoes,
because remember,

00:16:10.210 --> 00:16:12.530
she thought with her
hands, and she --

00:16:12.530 --> 00:16:15.760
so, she was at dinner and thought,
"Oh, I know what it should be",

00:16:15.760 --> 00:16:18.740
and she used the mashed potatoes.

00:16:18.740 --> 00:16:24.230
And then, she modeled with clay,
she sketched a soft space of greens

00:16:24.230 --> 00:16:29.330
and blues, you can see
right here -- right here.

00:16:29.330 --> 00:16:34.930
And before mailing her entry she
put her thoughts into an essay,

00:16:34.930 --> 00:16:36.230
right here, she wrote it,

00:16:36.230 --> 00:16:39.970
she hand-wrote this essay
explaining about it.

00:16:42.090 --> 00:16:46.030
She wrote that her long, polished
wall would be a quiet place

00:16:46.030 --> 00:16:50.350
to remember all those
who died during the war.

00:16:50.350 --> 00:16:55.600
And a place to be experienced by
walking down and up past names

00:16:55.600 --> 00:16:59.170
that seemed to go on forever.

00:16:59.170 --> 00:17:01.850
The contest received
so many entries,

00:17:01.850 --> 00:17:05.140
enough to fill an airplane
hangar, that's a place

00:17:05.140 --> 00:17:07.770
where they store airplanes.

00:17:07.770 --> 00:17:10.910
Lots of famous architects
and artists entered,

00:17:10.910 --> 00:17:13.600
and the names of the
contestants were hidden

00:17:13.600 --> 00:17:16.010
from view, they just had a number.

00:17:16.010 --> 00:17:19.510
Right here, she was number 1026,

00:17:19.510 --> 00:17:24.280
and behind this poster there
was an envelope with her name,

00:17:24.280 --> 00:17:26.910
so they didn't know who it was.

00:17:26.910 --> 00:17:31.960 position:56%
There's the judges looking at all
the posters, you recognize that one?

00:17:31.960 --> 00:17:33.260
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:17:33.260 --> 00:17:34.560
&gt;&gt; Jean Walker Harvey: Where is it?

00:17:34.560 --> 00:17:40.190
Yeah, right there,
very cool isn't that?

00:17:40.190 --> 00:17:48.790 position:56%
[inhales sharply] Out of 1,421
entries Mya's was design was chosen.

00:17:48.790 --> 00:17:53.880
Simple, yet strong, creative
and new, but when they found

00:17:53.880 --> 00:17:58.140
out Mya was the winner,
the judges were shocked.

00:17:58.140 --> 00:18:05.750
She wasn't famous, she was a
young woman still in school.

00:18:05.750 --> 00:18:11.020 position:56%
Mya was as surprised as the
judges, all was excitement at first,

00:18:11.020 --> 00:18:12.470
but then people objected.

00:18:12.470 --> 00:18:16.850
Some people didn't like it, some
said the design looked like a bat,

00:18:16.850 --> 00:18:22.820
a boomerang, a black gash of shame,
they're angry words stung Mya.

00:18:22.820 --> 00:18:25.700
For months, public hearings were
held, and some people wanted

00:18:25.700 --> 00:18:31.870
to change the design, Mya
was young, but she was brave,

00:18:31.870 --> 00:18:37.550
she didn't back down, right?

00:18:37.550 --> 00:18:41.440
Finally, her design was approved,
and Mya worked with a team

00:18:41.440 --> 00:18:46.840
of architects and engineers who
devised plans to excavate the land,

00:18:46.840 --> 00:18:51.240
to dig it up, and then
build the wall.

00:18:51.240 --> 00:18:56.080
The granite, so the stone was
cut, polished, and engraved,

00:18:56.080 --> 00:18:58.530
carved with the soldiers' names.

00:18:58.530 --> 00:19:00.110
The earth was dug up,

00:19:00.110 --> 00:19:04.750
and Mya watched the panel
suspended in space set in place.

00:19:04.750 --> 00:19:09.850
And there's the people looking,
and there's -- she put her --

00:19:09.850 --> 00:19:13.550
Mya Lin putting her
hand against the names.

00:19:13.550 --> 00:19:17.830
The first time Mya
visited the finished wall,

00:19:17.830 --> 00:19:21.450
she searched for the name
of the father of a friend.

00:19:21.450 --> 00:19:28.110 position:56%
And when she touched the name, she
cried just as she knew others would.

00:19:28.110 --> 00:19:33.150
Thousands came that Veterans Day
to see, to touch, and remember.

00:19:33.150 --> 00:19:38.210
Salutes, hands on heart honoring,
and every day since then,

00:19:38.210 --> 00:19:40.370
visitors have done the same.

00:19:40.370 --> 00:19:46.670
And this Saturday is the 35th
anniversary of that Veterans Day.

00:19:46.670 --> 00:19:50.660
So, there'll be lots of
people here, that's right.

00:19:50.660 --> 00:19:54.560 position:56%
The Vietnam's Veteran Memorial was
the first of Mya's many works of art

00:19:54.560 --> 00:19:57.920
and architecture, memorial
sculptures, structures

00:19:57.920 --> 00:19:59.630
and spaces inside and out.

00:19:59.630 --> 00:20:03.760
And each piece is different,
but all share Mya's vision,

00:20:03.760 --> 00:20:06.860
she wants people to
be a part of her art.

00:20:06.860 --> 00:20:14.950
Look! Read, walk around, sit
by, think about -- mm-hmm.

00:20:14.950 --> 00:20:21.810
And just like when she named a hill
the -- do you remember what it was?

00:20:21.810 --> 00:20:30.410
The Lizard's Back, Mya names her
projects often words from nature.

00:20:30.410 --> 00:20:35.670
Names such as Sounding
Stones, Topo, can you say Topo?

00:20:35.670 --> 00:20:36.970
&gt;&gt; Topo.

00:20:36.970 --> 00:20:39.020
&gt;&gt; Jean Walker Harvey:
That's a fun one, isn't it?

00:20:39.020 --> 00:20:45.000
The Wave Field, 10 Degrees
North, and Reading a Garden.

00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:52.070
And there she is with her cat, had
to put the cat in there, right?

00:20:52.070 --> 00:20:59.790
And after naming a piece, the
final step in shaping her artwork,

00:20:59.790 --> 00:21:08.400
Mya Lin, the artist architect
is ready to dream, think again,

00:21:08.400 --> 00:21:11.580
and create something new.

00:21:11.580 --> 00:21:13.740
And that's the story of Mya Lin.

00:21:13.740 --> 00:21:15.540
Thank you.

00:21:15.540 --> 00:21:21.500
[ Applause ]

00:21:23.550 --> 00:21:26.900
&gt;&gt; Jean Walker Harvey: So, what
do you remember about Mya Lin?

00:21:26.900 --> 00:21:31.100
&gt;&gt; That she had a cat?

00:21:31.100 --> 00:21:33.770
&gt;&gt; Jean Walker Harvey: That
she had a cat, exactly, yes.

00:21:33.770 --> 00:21:37.360
&gt;&gt; She called hill,
The Lizard's Back.

00:21:37.360 --> 00:21:38.890
&gt;&gt; Jean Walker Harvey: She
called the hill where she grew

00:21:38.890 --> 00:21:41.160
up The Lizard's Back, yes?

00:21:41.160 --> 00:21:46.210
&gt;&gt; And when the people like,
they didn't like her art.

00:21:46.210 --> 00:21:48.340
&gt;&gt; Jean Walker Harvey:
And what did she do?

00:21:48.340 --> 00:21:52.920
When the people didn't like
her art, what did she do?

00:21:52.920 --> 00:21:54.220
&gt;&gt; She --

00:21:54.220 --> 00:21:58.810
&gt;&gt; Jean Walker Harvey:
Did she stand up?

00:21:58.810 --> 00:22:00.110
Was she strong?

00:22:00.110 --> 00:22:02.510
&gt;&gt; She was strong.

00:22:02.510 --> 00:22:05.410
&gt;&gt; Jean Walker Harvey: She
was strong, exactly, good.

00:22:05.410 --> 00:22:14.580
Yes? I remember that she -- that
when people didn't like her poster,

00:22:14.580 --> 00:22:20.530
she standed up and said,
I'm not going to give up.

00:22:20.530 --> 00:22:21.830
&gt;&gt; Jean Walker Harvey: Wonderful.

00:22:21.830 --> 00:22:26.220
She said -- when people didn't like
her poster and the design on it,

00:22:26.220 --> 00:22:30.600
she said, I'm going to stand
up, I'm not going to give up.

00:22:30.600 --> 00:22:32.570
Great. Good remembering.

00:22:32.570 --> 00:22:33.870
Good.

00:22:33.870 --> 00:22:39.320
&gt;&gt; That they -- that they didn't --
that she was in school, and she --

00:22:39.320 --> 00:22:41.830
and they can't -- they
couldn't believe that she was

00:22:41.830 --> 00:22:44.440
in school and she made that art.

00:22:44.440 --> 00:22:45.780
&gt;&gt; Jean Walker Harvey: Exactly.

00:22:45.780 --> 00:22:49.430
They couldn't believe
it that the winner

00:22:49.430 --> 00:22:52.110
of the contest was still in school.

00:22:52.110 --> 00:22:55.620
They couldn't believe that,
they were just shocked, yes.

00:22:55.620 --> 00:22:57.560
She was so young.

00:22:57.560 --> 00:22:58.860
Yes.

00:22:58.860 --> 00:23:03.320
&gt;&gt; Her whole family loved art.

00:23:03.320 --> 00:23:04.620
&gt;&gt; Jean Walker Harvey:
Good remembering.

00:23:04.620 --> 00:23:06.620
Her whole family loved art.

00:23:06.620 --> 00:23:10.580
Her mom was a poet, her
dad made art with clay.

00:23:10.580 --> 00:23:14.370
She grew up around art
and it inspired her, yes.

00:23:14.370 --> 00:23:23.510
&gt;&gt; I think that she -- had to make
that, because she was learning

00:23:23.510 --> 00:23:28.960
about to make it with
mashed potatoes.

00:23:28.960 --> 00:23:30.260
&gt;&gt; Jean Walker Harvey: Exactly.

00:23:30.260 --> 00:23:34.370
So, when she was inspired by
the -- she came up with an idea,

00:23:34.370 --> 00:23:37.400
and she said, "Oh, I need to
make it, how should I make it?"

00:23:37.400 --> 00:23:40.200
And she used her hands
and made it out of --

00:23:40.200 --> 00:23:41.500
&gt;&gt; Mashed potatoes.

00:23:41.500 --> 00:23:42.800
&gt;&gt; Jean Walker Harvey:
Mashed potatoes.

00:23:42.800 --> 00:23:44.680
You get to play with food, right.

00:23:44.680 --> 00:23:46.980
Yes?

00:23:48.290 --> 00:23:52.630
&gt;&gt; When she was surprised that
she win the contest of the thing.

00:23:52.630 --> 00:23:55.380
&gt;&gt; Yes, when she won
the contest she was

00:23:55.380 --> 00:23:59.230
so surprised just like the judges.

00:23:59.230 --> 00:24:00.530
Yes?

00:24:00.530 --> 00:24:07.920
&gt;&gt; When she was writing her
grandma, she wrote something,

00:24:07.920 --> 00:24:12.840
and then she mailed
it to her grandma.

00:24:12.840 --> 00:24:15.510
And then, her grandma
wrote some of it,

00:24:15.510 --> 00:24:18.630
and then her grandma
even mailed it back.

00:24:18.630 --> 00:24:19.930
&gt;&gt; Jean Walker Harvey:
That's lovely.

00:24:19.930 --> 00:24:23.800
You remembered what I did as
an author, that I wrote stories

00:24:23.800 --> 00:24:25.210
and sent it to my grandmother,

00:24:25.210 --> 00:24:27.710
and then she would add
to it, and send it back.

00:24:27.710 --> 00:24:32.580
Yes, and that inspired me just
like Mya Lin's parents inspired her

00:24:32.580 --> 00:24:36.280
with the art, I was
inspired to do my writing.

00:24:36.280 --> 00:24:39.420
Right, very nice.

00:24:39.420 --> 00:24:40.720
Yes?

00:24:40.720 --> 00:24:43.910
&gt;&gt; She built the soldiers
who died during the war.

00:24:43.910 --> 00:24:45.210
&gt;&gt; Jean Walker Harvey: Very good.

00:24:45.210 --> 00:24:48.020
She built a memorial --
she designed a memorial

00:24:48.020 --> 00:24:52.220
that honored the soldiers
during the Vietnam War who died

00:24:52.220 --> 00:24:58.790
by having a memorial designed that
was -- included all the names,

00:24:58.790 --> 00:25:03.850
which was 57,000 names,
so many people.

00:25:03.850 --> 00:25:06.380
So, she was honoring them.

00:25:06.380 --> 00:25:11.120
Very nice you remembered this.

00:25:11.120 --> 00:25:12.420
Yes?

00:25:12.420 --> 00:25:15.860
&gt;&gt; She was watching the
architects build a wall.

00:25:15.860 --> 00:25:17.160
&gt;&gt; Jean Walker Harvey: Mm-hmm.

00:25:17.160 --> 00:25:22.400
She was an artist architect who
designed what they call The Wall,

00:25:22.400 --> 00:25:30.320 position:56%
because it has -- it's the two walls
that come together like a long V.

00:25:30.320 --> 00:25:34.170
And it has the names, and people
are -- when you walk by it,

00:25:34.170 --> 00:25:37.860
you walk down, and then walk
back up, and you're reflected,

00:25:37.860 --> 00:25:42.220
your picture is reflected
on the names.

00:25:42.220 --> 00:25:43.520
Yes?

00:25:43.520 --> 00:25:46.650
&gt;&gt; She put her hand in
the wall to say the names.

00:25:46.650 --> 00:25:47.950
&gt;&gt; Jean Walker Harvey: And
that's nice, and she --

00:25:47.950 --> 00:25:49.250
&gt;&gt; And she was crying.

00:25:49.250 --> 00:25:51.530
&gt;&gt; Jean Walker Harvey: And she
was crying when she put her name

00:25:51.530 --> 00:25:56.880
against the wall where her father
-- her friend's father's name was.

00:25:56.880 --> 00:26:00.510
She cried just like she
knew other would cry,

00:26:00.510 --> 00:26:04.370
and I cried when I
was there too, mm-hmm.

00:26:04.370 --> 00:26:05.670
Yes?

00:26:05.670 --> 00:26:09.070
&gt;&gt; You know, when I was a
little kid my grandmother died.

00:26:09.070 --> 00:26:11.630
&gt;&gt; Jean Walker Harvey: Oh,
I'm sorry to hear that.

00:26:13.010 --> 00:26:16.120
Names are very important, that's
a way of remembering people,

00:26:16.120 --> 00:26:17.420
that's what she was saying.

00:26:17.420 --> 00:26:20.490
We think of everything --
when you think of your name,

00:26:20.490 --> 00:26:24.160
or your friend's name, or your
family's name, or your grandmother,

00:26:24.160 --> 00:26:26.530
you remember all sorts
of things about them.

00:26:26.530 --> 00:26:29.420
That's why Mya Lin thought
the power of the name.

00:26:29.420 --> 00:26:33.390
So, do you have any questions
about the book, about writing?

00:26:33.390 --> 00:26:34.900
Someone had one about the Library

00:26:34.900 --> 00:26:38.890
of Congress before I came
in, will you share that one?

00:26:43.210 --> 00:26:49.830
&gt;&gt; I said, what -- how long has
the Library of Congress been here?

00:26:49.830 --> 00:26:52.370
&gt;&gt; Jean Walker Harvey: How long has
the Library of Congress been here?

00:26:52.370 --> 00:26:54.770
I would love to know that answer.

00:26:54.770 --> 00:26:58.560
&gt;&gt; Lee Ann Potter: I
love that question.

00:26:58.560 --> 00:27:03.380
The Library of Congress has existed
since 1800, but this building

00:27:03.380 --> 00:27:07.640
that you're in, it's a lot younger.

00:27:07.640 --> 00:27:12.970 position:56%
It's only been here since the 1890s.

00:27:12.970 --> 00:27:16.220
It's old, isn't that neat.

00:27:16.220 --> 00:27:17.840
&gt;&gt; Jean Walker Harvey: Can
you say what the Library

00:27:17.840 --> 00:27:20.710
of Congress -- it's the most --

00:27:20.710 --> 00:27:22.010
&gt;&gt; Lee Ann Potter: Yeah.

00:27:22.010 --> 00:27:23.310
&gt;&gt; Jean Walker Harvey: To me, it --

00:27:23.310 --> 00:27:24.610
&gt;&gt; Lee Ann Potter: Have
you guys been here before?

00:27:24.610 --> 00:27:25.910
&gt;&gt; No.

00:27:25.910 --> 00:27:27.210
&gt;&gt; Lee Ann Potter: Okay.

00:27:27.210 --> 00:27:28.510
Well, you're going to love this.

00:27:28.510 --> 00:27:29.810
So, when you go home today, you
can tell your parents that --

00:27:29.810 --> 00:27:31.110
okay, you ready for this?

00:27:31.110 --> 00:27:32.410
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:27:32.410 --> 00:27:33.710
&gt;&gt; Lee Ann Potter: The Library

00:27:33.710 --> 00:27:35.010
of Congress is the largest
library in the whole world.

00:27:35.010 --> 00:27:36.310
So, when you go home, and you
say, "Guess what I did today?"

00:27:36.310 --> 00:27:37.800
And your folks are like,
"What'd you do today?"

00:27:37.800 --> 00:27:41.270
You say, "I went to the
world's largest library, and" --

00:27:41.270 --> 00:27:44.470
I'm serious, you got to do this.

00:27:44.470 --> 00:27:47.440
Because those conversations with
your family are the best way

00:27:47.440 --> 00:27:49.150
for them to tell you
about their day,

00:27:49.150 --> 00:27:50.770
and for you to tell
them about your day.

00:27:50.770 --> 00:27:53.090
So, you say, "I went to
the Library of Congress,

00:27:53.090 --> 00:27:57.530
the world's largest library today,
and I got to meet an author."

00:27:57.530 --> 00:27:59.690
And they'll say, "Oh,
who was that author?"

00:27:59.690 --> 00:28:03.790
And you'll say, oh, her
name is Jean Walker Harvey.

00:28:03.790 --> 00:28:06.060
And they'll say, "Oh, tell
me about Jean Walker Harvey."

00:28:06.060 --> 00:28:09.060
And you'll say, "Well, she
wrote this book about Mya Lin."

00:28:09.060 --> 00:28:11.070
And they'll say, "Who's Mya Lin?"

00:28:11.070 --> 00:28:15.050
And you guys will tell the whole
story, and your parents will look

00:28:15.050 --> 00:28:17.060
at you, and your grandparents
will look, and your brothers

00:28:17.060 --> 00:28:19.100 position:56%
and sisters will look at you, and
your friends and neighbors will look

00:28:19.100 --> 00:28:23.810
at you like -- and
they'll be so impressed.

00:28:23.810 --> 00:28:26.100
How many of you will do that?

00:28:26.100 --> 00:28:27.580
Yes, I know you all will.

00:28:27.580 --> 00:28:29.880
Awesome.

00:28:31.430 --> 00:28:33.940
&gt;&gt; There were other
questions I think.

00:28:37.210 --> 00:28:40.130
&gt;&gt; One time when I was doing
a quiz in my mom's car,

00:28:40.130 --> 00:28:43.610
it asked what is the
biggest library,

00:28:43.610 --> 00:28:45.580
and I said the Library of Congress.

00:28:45.580 --> 00:28:47.230
&gt;&gt; Lee Ann Potter:
You already knew that.

00:28:47.230 --> 00:28:48.530
All right.

00:28:48.530 --> 00:28:49.830
All right.

00:28:49.830 --> 00:28:51.130 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Jean Walker Harvey: That's great.

00:28:51.130 --> 00:28:52.430
He already asked someone
about the Library of Congress.

00:28:52.430 --> 00:28:53.820
He knew that, that's great.

00:28:53.820 --> 00:28:56.120
Yes?

00:28:59.250 --> 00:29:01.770
Jean Walker Harvey: Did
you have a question?

00:29:01.770 --> 00:29:04.070
Okay.

00:29:06.080 --> 00:29:07.420
Jean Walker Harvey: Okay,
we'll come back to you.

00:29:07.420 --> 00:29:12.280
Did someone else have a question
about writing books, or -- yes?

00:29:13.360 --> 00:29:18.050
&gt;&gt; What book did you
write before -- ?

00:29:18.050 --> 00:29:20.590
&gt;&gt; Jean Walker Harvey: Oh, which
book did I write before Mya Lin?

00:29:20.590 --> 00:29:23.040
Well, that was one
of my animal books.

00:29:23.040 --> 00:29:30.830
That came out in last year, and
it's about a Hawaiian monk seal.

00:29:30.830 --> 00:29:32.670
Hawaiian monk seal.

00:29:32.670 --> 00:29:38.900
So, it was -- she had a fishing
hook caught in her mouth.

00:29:38.900 --> 00:29:40.200
I know, I --

00:29:40.200 --> 00:29:41.500
&gt;&gt; That's going to hurt.

00:29:41.500 --> 00:29:42.800
&gt;&gt; Jean Walker Harvey: That would
-- that's going to hurt a lot,

00:29:42.800 --> 00:29:45.230
but they were able to take
it out, and they saved her.

00:29:45.230 --> 00:29:50.110
So, that's a really sweet story,
I like animal stories too.

00:29:50.110 --> 00:29:54.990 position:56%
I like art, and I like animals, just
like Mya Lin likes art and nature.

00:29:54.990 --> 00:29:57.870
So -- yes?

00:29:57.870 --> 00:30:01.260
&gt;&gt; Why do you write books?

00:30:01.260 --> 00:30:02.560
&gt;&gt; Jean Walker Harvey:
Why do I write books?

00:30:02.560 --> 00:30:03.860
Great question.

00:30:03.860 --> 00:30:08.810
Jean Walker Harvey: So, I write
books because I love stories.

00:30:08.810 --> 00:30:13.380
And I actually love all sorts of
stories, but particularly for me,

00:30:13.380 --> 00:30:20.550
I like to write true stories that
inspire us, that we learn things.

00:30:20.550 --> 00:30:24.930
I'm so curious, and I get
to then read lots of books

00:30:24.930 --> 00:30:29.190
to write my books, so I'm
always wanting to learn more.

00:30:29.190 --> 00:30:34.770
But I also think words are really
powerful, words share emotions,

00:30:34.770 --> 00:30:39.670
ideas, they describe things.

00:30:39.670 --> 00:30:42.450
So, I just think that
-- how many of you -- ?

00:30:42.450 --> 00:30:46.140
Let's see again who --
how many like to read?

00:30:46.140 --> 00:30:49.010
Great. And how many
of you like to write?

00:30:49.010 --> 00:30:55.540
Oh! So, I bet there's some
authors in this group, yes, mm-hmm.

00:30:55.540 --> 00:30:58.870
Yes? Did you have a -- ?

00:30:58.870 --> 00:31:00.170
Oh, you were stretching.

00:31:00.170 --> 00:31:01.470
Yes?

00:31:01.470 --> 00:31:02.770
&gt;&gt; [inaudible]

00:31:02.770 --> 00:31:07.530
&gt;&gt; There was a robbery,
and then the --

00:31:07.530 --> 00:31:19.030
one of the best friends they
found out who was the robber,

00:31:19.030 --> 00:31:24.970
it was their other best friend.

00:31:24.970 --> 00:31:26.960
&gt;&gt; Jean Walker Harvey: That
seems like a sad story, but it --

00:31:26.960 --> 00:31:30.360
that's wonderful you're writing
stories about your friends.

00:31:30.360 --> 00:31:31.660
Yes?

00:31:31.660 --> 00:31:37.400
&gt;&gt; You know, sometimes
I write songs.

00:31:37.400 --> 00:31:38.700
&gt;&gt; Jean Walker Harvey: Ah!

00:31:38.700 --> 00:31:43.320 position:56%
That's another form of writing, song
writing, poetry writing, exactly.

00:31:43.320 --> 00:31:44.620
Yes?

00:31:44.620 --> 00:31:48.610
&gt;&gt; What was your very first book?

00:31:48.610 --> 00:31:52.470
&gt;&gt; Jean Walker Harvey: My very
first book was another animal book.

00:31:52.470 --> 00:31:58.350
And that was about -- called
Astro: The Stellar Sea Lion.

00:31:58.350 --> 00:32:05.330
It's another true story, and
he was stranded, he was all --

00:32:05.330 --> 00:32:08.120 position:56%
left all alone as a little tiny pup.

00:32:08.120 --> 00:32:12.350
And then they rescued him,
so that's a sweet story too.

00:32:12.350 --> 00:32:13.650
Yes?

00:32:13.650 --> 00:32:18.350
&gt;&gt; What person book
did you like -- ?

00:32:18.350 --> 00:32:22.920
What kind of book do you like?

00:32:22.920 --> 00:32:24.530
&gt;&gt; Jean Walker Harvey: What
kind of books do I like?

00:32:24.530 --> 00:32:25.830
That's a good question.

00:32:25.830 --> 00:32:29.160
I actually, oh, I like
so many types.

00:32:29.160 --> 00:32:32.920
I just love to read,
but I like stories too,

00:32:32.920 --> 00:32:38.310
the novels that have a good story
that I just can't stop reading.

00:32:38.310 --> 00:32:41.770
And then I stay awake, and
I have to finish the book.

00:32:41.770 --> 00:32:44.020
Do you ever read those?

00:32:44.020 --> 00:32:45.870
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:32:45.870 --> 00:32:47.170
&gt;&gt; Jean Walker Harvey: Yeah.

00:32:47.170 --> 00:32:48.470
Yes?

00:32:48.470 --> 00:32:53.560
&gt;&gt; What was your last person
book that you ever read?

00:32:53.560 --> 00:32:55.880
&gt;&gt; Jean Walker Harvey: My last
-- oh, that I read, or wrote?

00:32:55.880 --> 00:32:57.180
&gt;&gt; Or write.

00:32:57.180 --> 00:32:58.480
&gt;&gt; Jean Walker Harvey: Or wrote.

00:32:58.480 --> 00:32:59.780
So, last person book.

00:32:59.780 --> 00:33:01.080
So, do you know what the word --

00:33:01.080 --> 00:33:02.380
what's a word called
for a person book?

00:33:02.380 --> 00:33:03.680
Remember that?

00:33:03.680 --> 00:33:07.750
Bio -- biography, right.

00:33:07.750 --> 00:33:09.660
The last biography
I wrote it was an --

00:33:09.660 --> 00:33:14.640
about an artist, and his
name was Romare Bearden.

00:33:14.640 --> 00:33:20.600
And he painted big paintings,
and he lived in North Carolina,

00:33:20.600 --> 00:33:22.910
then he went up to Harlem.

00:33:22.910 --> 00:33:27.590
And he painted collages,
so lots about his family,

00:33:27.590 --> 00:33:30.680
and it had trains in
it, he loved trains.

00:33:30.680 --> 00:33:35.760
Because I also work at the Museum
of Modern Art in San Francisco.

00:33:35.760 --> 00:33:40.310
And I give tours to students
there, and they had lots

00:33:40.310 --> 00:33:42.790
of his paintings, and
I really liked that.

00:33:42.790 --> 00:33:47.160
Maybe I can send your class
that book, I'll do that.

00:33:47.160 --> 00:33:48.870
Yes?

00:33:48.870 --> 00:33:54.720 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Why did you write Mya Lin's book?

00:33:54.720 --> 00:33:56.350
&gt;&gt; Jean Walker Harvey: Why
did I write Mya Lin's book?

00:33:56.350 --> 00:33:57.650
Great question.

00:33:57.650 --> 00:34:01.480
Because I learned about her
back when I was in college

00:34:01.480 --> 00:34:02.830
because she was in college.

00:34:02.830 --> 00:34:08.500
And I just was always so
interested in her story,

00:34:08.500 --> 00:34:09.920
so I wanted to learn more.

00:34:09.920 --> 00:34:15.120
So, then I read books, and I went
to the Library of Congress website,

00:34:15.120 --> 00:34:16.500
because I live all
the way in California.

00:34:16.500 --> 00:34:21.920 position:56%
But there's so much information that
I was able to find right on there,

00:34:21.920 --> 00:34:24.470
but I like coming here in person.

00:34:24.470 --> 00:34:25.770
Yes?

00:34:25.770 --> 00:34:31.250
&gt;&gt; What do Mya -- What do Mya
Lin look like in person now?

00:34:31.250 --> 00:34:32.550
&gt;&gt;Jean Walker Harvey: Oh,
that's a good question.

00:34:32.550 --> 00:34:34.730
Oh, pretty much like the
photo, do you remember

00:34:34.730 --> 00:34:36.690
when the cat was on the table?

00:34:36.690 --> 00:34:38.840
That's pretty recent, right.

00:34:38.840 --> 00:34:40.140
Yes?

00:34:40.140 --> 00:34:42.380
&gt;&gt;What's your favorite painting?

00:34:42.380 --> 00:34:43.680
&gt;&gt; Jean Walker Harvey:
What's my favorite painting?

00:34:43.680 --> 00:34:48.790
Oh, that's impossible, that
-- but thank you for asking.

00:34:48.790 --> 00:34:53.500
Oh, boy, I like so many artists
at the Museum of Modern Art.

00:34:53.500 --> 00:34:56.520 position:56%
So -- what's your favorite painting?

00:34:56.520 --> 00:35:02.290
Do you have a favorite artist?

00:35:02.290 --> 00:35:04.210
Do you do art?

00:35:04.210 --> 00:35:05.510
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:35:05.510 --> 00:35:06.810
&gt;&gt; Jean Walker Harvey: Oh, good,

00:35:06.810 --> 00:35:09.480
that might be a favorite
painting, yeah.

00:35:09.480 --> 00:35:11.030
Let's see, who else -- ?

00:35:11.030 --> 00:35:12.330
Yes?

00:35:12.330 --> 00:35:15.520
&gt;&gt; Have you ever drew a painting?

00:35:15.520 --> 00:35:16.890
&gt;&gt; Jean Walker Harvey: Oh,
do I ever do a painting?

00:35:16.890 --> 00:35:18.860
That's a good question,
because my mom

00:35:18.860 --> 00:35:20.920
and my grandmother
were both artists.

00:35:20.920 --> 00:35:23.650
And they made paint
-- I can't paint.

00:35:23.650 --> 00:35:27.000
No, I'm not very good at that,
I'm more of a word person.

00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:30.920
So, that's why I love
writing picture books so,

00:35:30.920 --> 00:35:32.540
because I love the illustrations.

00:35:32.540 --> 00:35:37.060
And didn't Dow do such beautiful
artwork, because both the words

00:35:37.060 --> 00:35:41.160
and the pictures are equally
important, it's a collaboration.

00:35:41.160 --> 00:35:42.640
I just love all your questions.

00:35:42.640 --> 00:35:43.940
How much more time do we have?

00:35:43.940 --> 00:35:45.240
Is this okay?

00:35:45.240 --> 00:35:46.540
Great. Yes?

00:35:46.540 --> 00:35:47.840
&gt;&gt; What's your favorite color?

00:35:47.840 --> 00:35:49.140
&gt;&gt; Jean Walker Harvey: Ooh, blue.

00:35:49.140 --> 00:35:50.440
[ Laughter ]

00:35:52.080 --> 00:35:53.380
&gt;&gt; Blue, yeah, that's my favorite.

00:35:53.380 --> 00:35:54.680
&gt;&gt; Lee Ann Potter:
That's your -- yeah.

00:35:54.680 --> 00:35:55.980
&gt;&gt; Jean Walker Harvey: Yeah.

00:35:55.980 --> 00:35:57.280
Ooh, that's a nice
blue, really nice.

00:35:57.280 --> 00:35:58.580
Yes?

00:35:58.580 --> 00:35:59.880
&gt;&gt; Are you an illustrator
or an author?

00:35:59.880 --> 00:36:02.950
&gt;&gt; Jean Walker Harvey: And --
so, if I write words, I'm a --

00:36:02.950 --> 00:36:04.250
&gt;&gt; Author.

00:36:04.250 --> 00:36:05.550
&gt;&gt; Jean Walker Harvey:
Author, excellent.

00:36:05.550 --> 00:36:06.850
Yes. Yes?

00:36:06.850 --> 00:36:08.150
&gt;&gt; What's your favorite
snack to eat?

00:36:08.150 --> 00:36:11.130
&gt;&gt; Jean Walker Harvey: Oh,
that's easy too, chocolate.

00:36:11.130 --> 00:36:12.750
&gt;&gt; Ah!

00:36:12.750 --> 00:36:14.050
&gt;&gt; Jean Walker Harvey: Now,

00:36:14.050 --> 00:36:16.750
if they make blue chocolate,
think how happy I'd be.

00:36:16.750 --> 00:36:18.100
&gt;&gt; Very happy.

00:36:18.100 --> 00:36:19.400
&gt;&gt; Jean Walker Harvey: Very happy.

00:36:19.400 --> 00:36:21.250
&gt;&gt; What's your favorite number?

00:36:21.250 --> 00:36:23.610
&gt;&gt; Jean Walker Harvey:
Oh, I don't know, 23.

00:36:23.610 --> 00:36:25.500
&gt;&gt; Twenty-three?

00:36:25.500 --> 00:36:26.800
&gt;&gt; Jean Walker Harvey: Yeah.

00:36:26.800 --> 00:36:28.150
Yes?

00:36:28.150 --> 00:36:30.480
&gt;&gt; What's your favorite Doritos?

00:36:30.480 --> 00:36:31.780
&gt;&gt; Jean Walker Harvey: Doritos?

00:36:31.780 --> 00:36:33.080
&gt;&gt; Chips?

00:36:33.080 --> 00:36:34.380
&gt;&gt; Jean Walker Harvey: Classic.

00:36:34.380 --> 00:36:37.050
&gt;&gt; Classic?

00:36:37.050 --> 00:36:38.350
&gt;&gt; Jean Walker Harvey: Yeah.

00:36:38.350 --> 00:36:39.650
Yes?

00:36:39.650 --> 00:36:40.950
&gt;&gt; Why do you like books?

00:36:40.950 --> 00:36:42.250
&gt;&gt; Jean Walker Harvey:
Why do I like books?

00:36:42.250 --> 00:36:45.720
Oh, they open up a
world, new worlds for me.

00:36:45.720 --> 00:36:51.730
I get to learn about other people,
other places, new experiences,

00:36:51.730 --> 00:36:56.310
other ways of thinking,
new adventures.

00:36:56.310 --> 00:36:58.610
Why do you like books?

00:37:01.070 --> 00:37:03.480
What kind of books do you like?

00:37:03.480 --> 00:37:07.970
Or what do like -- do you like
to read about animals or people?

00:37:07.970 --> 00:37:11.110
Or all kinds?

00:37:11.110 --> 00:37:12.880
&gt;&gt; All kinds.

00:37:12.880 --> 00:37:15.650
&gt;&gt; Jean Walker Harvey:
All kinds, good.

00:37:15.650 --> 00:37:17.030
Good. Yes?

00:37:17.030 --> 00:37:20.270
&gt;&gt; Blue is my last name.

00:37:20.270 --> 00:37:22.160
&gt;&gt; Jean Walker Harvey: What is?

00:37:22.160 --> 00:37:24.870
&gt;&gt; Blue is my last name.

00:37:24.870 --> 00:37:28.220
&gt;&gt; Jean Walker Harvey: Well, there
you go, Blue's your last name.

00:37:28.220 --> 00:37:30.180
One more question, I don't
think I've heard from you.

00:37:30.180 --> 00:37:31.480
Yes?

00:37:31.480 --> 00:37:32.860
&gt;&gt; Do you ever read your own books?

00:37:32.860 --> 00:37:34.510
&gt;&gt; Jean Walker Harvey: Do
I ever read my own books?

00:37:34.510 --> 00:37:36.160
To you I do, I love that.

00:37:36.160 --> 00:37:39.300
And you know, when I -- because I
write picture books that are meant

00:37:39.300 --> 00:37:44.470
to be read aloud, I read
them aloud to my cat a lot.

00:37:44.470 --> 00:37:46.030
So, she hears them all.

00:37:46.030 --> 00:37:50.160
Thank you all so much for
being an amazing audience,

00:37:50.160 --> 00:37:51.460
I just love seeing all of you.

00:37:51.460 --> 00:37:55.500
So -- and thank you
for bringing them.
