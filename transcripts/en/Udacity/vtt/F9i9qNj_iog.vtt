00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:02.089
So Carl, you've been at Google for
awhile now.

00:00:02.089 --> 00:00:03.670
&gt;&gt; Six years.
&gt;&gt; And it sounds like.

00:00:03.670 --> 00:00:04.560
Wow six years.

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:08.390
And it sounds like prototyping
has changed over that time.

00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:11.080
Can you just sort of talk a little
bit about how that's happened?

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:14.670
&gt;&gt; Yeah, prototyping has evolved
quite a bit in my tenure at Google.

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:18.940
When I first came to search, for
instance, almost three years ago,

00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:22.140
we were focused heavily on creating
web products specifically for

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:23.538
their desktop users.

00:00:23.538 --> 00:00:30.350
Google's shift has grown significantly
over the last few years.

00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:32.259
And we've gone mobile first.

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:37.160
And so as a result, I've had to evolve
with the times and have also shifted

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:41.685
my development practices towards
doing full time Android development.

00:00:41.685 --> 00:00:42.500
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:45.380
So you now sort of lead
a team of Android developers.

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:47.500
&gt;&gt; That's right.
So I lead a team of four people,

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:53.214
specifically looking at search, map and
identity products across Google.

00:00:53.214 --> 00:00:54.450
&gt;&gt; Awesome.

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:57.820
And I know you've worked on some
things in their earlier stages,

00:00:57.820 --> 00:00:59.310
that's one of the joys of prototyping,

00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:02.630
you get to see these things before they
happen and some of them never do happen.

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:05.754
But can you tell me a little
about working on material design?

00:01:05.754 --> 00:01:09.542
&gt;&gt; Sure, material design was a fantastic
project to work on, we spent about

00:01:09.542 --> 00:01:13.282
a year ramping up on that before we
ever released anything to the public.

00:01:13.282 --> 00:01:18.436
I think in its infancy we were thinking
about it, we called it quantum paper,

00:01:18.436 --> 00:01:23.511
and we were really thinking about this
idea that it was digital paper, and so

00:01:23.511 --> 00:01:28.780
we were thinking about how does digital
paper do things like respond to touch.

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:33.050
How do we show layers for instance,
inside of that digital paper landscape.

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:38.001
We made a number of prototypes across
the early stages of that project.

00:01:38.001 --> 00:01:42.595
We even did some really ugly ones
with some really bad electronic

00:01:42.595 --> 00:01:45.669
mesh-like touch responsiveness stuff.

00:01:45.669 --> 00:01:46.880
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:48.840
&gt;&gt; That ultimately,

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:53.040
we did away with a lot of that stuff
in favor of a really simple UI and so

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:58.800
that's where we ended going with the
touch ripples, for instance, in Android.

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:00.970
I think a much better experience for
our users.

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:04.140
It's a little simpler, a little bit
cleaner and I think as a result a bit

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:08.919
more delightful than some of the early
mesh-tron like stuff we were doing.

00:02:08.919 --> 00:02:10.300
&gt;&gt; Right, that makes sense.

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:13.061
And so some of these decisions you
made to sort of scrap this version

00:02:13.061 --> 00:02:15.290
of a product and
come out with this simpler one.

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:16.830
Was that made based on user feedback?

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:18.580
Was that made based on some
other kind of feedback?

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:21.460
Was that made out of the blue?

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:22.370
&gt;&gt; Not really out of the blue.

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:24.700
We got tons and tons of feedback.

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:27.480
We as a group of designers and
developers were sequestered for

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:29.650
a couple of months
working on the project.

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:32.630
We got lots and lots of feedback from

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:36.270
not only the executive sponsors of
the project but then a number of design

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:41.070
stakeholders as well as a lot
of users that we did tests with.

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:45.670
We did some guerilla cafe-style
testing across the Google campus.

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:49.870
We even brought in
outside trusted testers

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:52.230
to give us their feedback
on the experience.

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:53.980
&gt;&gt; So you mentioned that
native prototyping has

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:55.360
sort of come to the forefront at Google.

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:57.140
&gt;&gt; That's right.
&gt;&gt; Can you talk a little bit about

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:00.040
why that is and sort of what you get out
of that that you wouldn't be able to get

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:02.820
out of just a web prototype
that you've put on on a phone.

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:06.990
&gt;&gt; Sure, one of the areas
that I think we have focused

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:10.220
a great deal of energy is actually
in prototyping voice experiences.

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:15.672
This is an area that we can't do a whole
lot as far as the web side of things.

00:03:15.672 --> 00:03:19.966
For instance, we're limited by some
platform vendors in the access that we

00:03:19.966 --> 00:03:21.250
have to their API's.

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:21.858
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.
&gt;&gt; So

00:03:21.858 --> 00:03:26.068
going with a fully native experience
means that we get a much wider set of

00:03:26.068 --> 00:03:27.761
tools that we can work with.

00:03:27.761 --> 00:03:28.717
So for instance,

00:03:28.717 --> 00:03:32.682
in the we get much tighter
integration with voice components.

00:03:32.682 --> 00:03:35.363
&gt;&gt; Right.
&gt;&gt; We can do a really beautiful voice

00:03:35.363 --> 00:03:40.304
experience, lot's of delightful
animation around that experience as

00:03:40.304 --> 00:03:44.400
we bring that prototype or
that application to life.

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:45.060
&gt;&gt; Perfect, thank you.
