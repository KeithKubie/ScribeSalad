00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:17.580
For many beer aficionados “tastes like warm
piss” is perhaps the most withering insult

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:21.070
one can hurl in the general direction of a
given beer.

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:24.440
While you wouldn’t begrudge a member of
the public making such a claim about a particular

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:29.570
beer, you’d think brewers themselves would
have a little more decorum.

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:33.600
Something nobody apparently told a certain
Heineken distributor in the 1980s when they

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:38.850
were able to convince the general public that
Corona literally contained human urine.

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:44.229
The origins of this sordid tale of corporate
shenanigans can be traced back to 1979 and

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:46.940
the American debut of Corona.

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:50.830
Described officially as a “pale lager”
the urine coloured Mexican-beer is the flagship

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:56.060
product of Mexican brewer Grupo Modelo and
has a respectable share of the beer market

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:58.270
in most countries it is sold.

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:02.450
Upon its debut in America the beer was a hit,
quickly becoming one of the most well-known

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:05.990
and in-demand imported beers in the entire
country.

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:11.120
In particular, Corona was noted as being especially
popular with “young urban professionals”

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:15.850
drawn to the “surfer aesthetic” the company
had cultivated in its advertising.

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:20.890
According to industry experts, by 1986 Corona
had captured around half a percent of the

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:22.600
entire American beer market.

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:28.100
This may not sound like a lot, but it represented
sales to the tune of 13 million cases of beer

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:32.690
annually, which after adjusting for inflation
for the cost of each case, would be in today’s

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:36.579
dollars well over $300 million in gross revenue.

00:02:36.579 --> 00:02:41.910
These sales numbers also made the zesty Mexican
lager the second most popular imported beer

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:45.730
in the entire United States behind Dutch beer,
Heineken.

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:50.950
This all brings us to 1986, when Corona executives
noticed that sales of the beer had begun to

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:54.670
stall across the United States for no readily
apparent reason.

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:59.600
In fact, in some regions sales dropped by
as much as 80% while, oddly, in others nothing

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:01.810
much changed at all in the figures.

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:06.780
Confused Corona reached out to their suppliers
in regions of the U.S. where sales were stalling

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:10.760
and found that, not only was the beer not
selling as well when it was stocked, some

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:14.280
stores had actually stopped stocking it entirely.

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:18.489
Corona then did some sleuthing and discovered
that there was a frankly bizarre rumor being

00:03:18.489 --> 00:03:23.510
spread in bars across the United States that
Mexican workers at the main Corona brewery

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:27.350
frequently urinated in the vats used to ferment
the beer.

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:32.199
While this might seem farfetched, it is noteworthy
that the act of peeing in beer to make for

00:03:32.199 --> 00:03:37.540
a more robust flavor was actually historically
a thing, with the practice called leinting.

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:42.880
In fact, the 1742 London and Country Brewer
lamented this, stating, “…putting chamberly,

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:49.510
or human urine, into… pale or amber towpenny
malt drink… [is] nasty, horrid, and a detestable

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:51.890
piece of cunning and knavery…”

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:56.040
Nevertheless, there are many references to
such happening from this era, as well as many

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:58.609
more references of rumors to such, whether
true or not in many cases isn’t clear.

00:03:58.609 --> 00:04:01.850
But the point is, people have been accusing
beer makers of adding urine to their brew

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:05.010
seemingly as long as humans have been making
beer.

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:09.459
Thus, it’s no surprise that at some point
someone got the bright idea to insinuate that

00:04:09.459 --> 00:04:14.100
Corona, a pale yellow beer sold in clear bottles,
also contained urine.

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:17.949
And it’s further perhaps not surprising
that people actually believed it given attitudes

00:04:17.949 --> 00:04:22.360
at the time towards Mexican manufacturing
of just about anything.

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:26.070
This all left Corona in the rather bizarre
predicament of needing to get the word out

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:30.560
that they did not actually allow anyone to
pee in their beer, spending about $500,000

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:36.419
(about $1.1 million today) on ads informing
the public of this, while executives appeared

00:04:36.419 --> 00:04:39.970
on dozens of talk shows to reiterate the same
point.

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:44.560
Not without risk, the company was well aware
that by specifically denying that they put

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:49.110
urine in their beer, this may actually have
resulted in the rumor just getting spread

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:50.110
even further.

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:54.910
Nevertheless, as one Corona distributor executive,
Michael Mazzoni, noted, “We recognize there’s

00:04:54.910 --> 00:04:58.460
an element of risk in what we’ve done, but
we thought it was necessary to have the truth

00:04:58.460 --> 00:04:59.460
out there.”

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:03.460
While they were doing this, a Chicago-based
distributor of the beer, Barton Beers Ltd,

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:08.060
who the aforementioned Michael Mazzoni worked
for, decided to play detective and see if

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:10.650
they could find out where the rumors had begun.

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:13.900
They eventually traced it back to Reno, Nevada
as the jumping off point.

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:18.560
And when investigating further, found that
it appeared that employees of a rival distributor

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:23.520
called Luce &amp; Sons Inc, who primarily imported
the beer Heineken, were the ones who initially

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:24.520
spread the idea.

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:29.430
Luce &amp; Sons quickly found themselves staring
down a rather sizable lawsuit, but ultimately

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:33.740
paid a settlement out of court and were made
to give a public statement saying that Corona

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:49.629
wasn’t actually filled with piss.
