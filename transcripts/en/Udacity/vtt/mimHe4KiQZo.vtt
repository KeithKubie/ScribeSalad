00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
We had so much fun with pendulums and simple harmonic motion in Unit 5

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
that we decided to bring them back for Unit 6.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
For this problem we're going to imagine we have a pendulum here.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
And this time it's not gravity pulling on the pendulum. It's an electric field.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
The ball here at the end of the pendulum has some positive charge q,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000
which causes it to interact with the electric field in a way very similar

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
to the gravitational field we saw before.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
And just to make our lives easier, we're going to assume that this electric field is constant

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
just like we were looking at in those parallel plate problems.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
All right--so my question to you is, how was replacing the gravitational field

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000
with this electric field going to affect the behavior of our pendulum?

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.000
Well it turns out that even with an electric field instead of a gravitational field,

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
the pendulum will still have simple harmonic motion

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
and if this pendulum is in simple harmonic motion that means it has some period t.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:51.000
Given that the length of the pendulum is 0.75 m, that the mass of the ball on the end is 0.02 kg,

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:59.000
the electric field has a constant strength of 10 N/C, and the charge of the ball on the end is 0.01 C,

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.000
can you tell me what the period of this simple harmonic oscillation is going to be?

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
Put your answer here in seconds.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
Keep in mind when you're doing this problem that just like with a normal pendulum

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:13.000
this approximation that it's simple harmonic motion is actually only true for small angle θ.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
And that's the same case here.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
When you're working on this problem you can safely assume that

00:01:17.000 --> 99:59:59.000
we're only dealing with small values of θ--all right, good luck.
