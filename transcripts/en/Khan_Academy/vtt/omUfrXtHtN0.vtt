00:00:01.090 --> 00:00:04.020
Welcome to the presentation
on level 4 subtraction.

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:06.640
Let's get started
with some problems.

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:22.970
First problem I have here
is 33,220 minus 399.

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:26.250
So this like we did with, I
believe, that we also did

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:29.140
borrowing in the level
subtraction, we have to go

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:31.920
through all of the digits in
the top number starting with

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:36.220
the top right digit and make
sure that they are larger

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:37.320
than the digit below it.

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:42.080
Because you can only attract
a smaller number from

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.710
a larger number.

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:44.630
You can't do it the other
way, at least, until we

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:45.850
learn negative numbers.

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:47.710
So let's go through this and
check to make sure all the

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:48.660
top numbers are larger.

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:49.640
Well immediately, we see no.

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:52.650
Well this 0 is not
larger than 9.

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:56.300
So we have to borrow
to make the 0 bigger.

00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:00.170
So what we do is we borrow
1-- well some people say

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:01.010
we're borrowing a 1.

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:03.450
Some people say, I mean,
borrowing a 1 from the

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:06.535
10's place is really
like borrowing a 10.

00:01:06.535 --> 00:01:09.840
So for simplicity let's just
say we're borrowing a 1.

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:15.710
So you borrow a 1 from this 2
and this 10 will become a-- the

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:18.580
0 sorry, will become a 10.

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:23.040
And since we borrowed that
1, this 2 will become a 1.

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:26.940
We took 1 away from this 2 and
we gave it to the 0 to make 10.

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:29.560
We actually took 10 away
from this 2 because this

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:30.230
2's in the 10's place.

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:32.230
I don't want to
confuse you too much.

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:35.600
If just the mechanics of it are
we took 1 away from the 2 and

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:39.410
we put it in front of
the 0 to make 10.

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:40.320
Now let's keep checking.

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:42.400
So now we have a
1 in this place.

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:46.430
1 is smaller than 9, so
we have to borrow again.

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:50.400
So we borrow 1 from this 2 now.

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:52.920
So this 2 now becomes 1.

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:57.150
And this 1 will
now become an 11.

00:01:57.150 --> 00:01:59.920
So now we have a 10
is larger than a 9.

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:02.250
11 is larger than a 9.

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:06.810
1 is not larger than 3, so
we have to borrow again.

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:08.920
This is a good problem.

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:10.360
Maybe I should've warmed you
all up a little bit more.

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:11.540
It involves a lot of borrowing.

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:13.790
So in order to borrow we do
the same thing over again.

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:17.630
This 1 will become 11.

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:21.082
And it's going to borrow from
this 3, which will become a 2.

00:02:21.082 --> 00:02:22.270
I think we're done now.

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:25.900
10 is larger than 9, 11 is
larger than 9, 11 is larger

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:28.620
than 3, 2 is larger than
nothing, 3 is larger

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:29.800
than nothing.

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:30.915
So now we're ready to subtract.

00:02:30.915 --> 00:02:32.550
This is the easy part.

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:35.220
10 minus 9 is 1.

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:39.230
11 minus 9 is 2.

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:45.950
11 minus 3 is 8.

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:48.560
2 minus nothing is 2.

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:51.160
3 minus nothing is 3.

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:56.930
So we get 32,821.

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:59.480
The only thing that makes this
harder than just normal

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:01.470
subtraction is that you have to
know how to do the borrowing.

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:03.600
And the way I do the borrowing
might be different than the way

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:05.490
you learned in school, but I
think it's easier because you

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:08.680
do all of the borrowing at once
instead of switching back and

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:11.250
forth between borrowing
and subtracting.

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:14.040
So all we did here, we said
that 0 is less than 9.

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:15.320
Let's borrow 1.

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:19.100
The 0 becomes a 10 because
we got this 1 right here.

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:22.630
We got this 1 from this 2
and this 2 became a 1.

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:25.390
I think you might see the
pattern if we do a couple

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:26.460
of more problems.

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:29.370
So let's do a couple of more.

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:47.571
If I had 25,633 minus 578.

00:03:47.571 --> 00:03:49.860
So name drill.

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:52.970
Start at the top right and we
make sure that the digits on

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:55.630
top are larger than
the digit below it.

00:03:55.630 --> 00:04:00.530
Immediately we see 3 is smaller
than 8, so we have to borrow.

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:02.445
So this 3 will become 13.

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:11.430
And then we borrow from this
3, which will now become 2.

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:13.695
We took a 1 away from this
3, it became a 2, and

00:04:13.695 --> 00:04:16.250
this 1 is right here.

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:19.790
13 is now larger than 8, but
2 is now smaller than 7.

00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:21.120
So we have to borrow again.

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:24.640
This 2 becomes a 12.

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:29.290
And this 6 will become a 5.

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:33.920
13 is larger than 8, 12 is
larger than 7, 5 is the same

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:37.420
as 5, so you can actually
do the subtraction.

00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:39.560
Because 5 minus 5 is 0.

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:41.430
As long as the top number's
not smaller than the

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:42.180
number below it.

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:44.290
And then obviously this 5
is larger than this 0 and

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:46.740
this 2 is larger than
this nothing here.

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:48.450
So now we're ready to subtract.

00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:53.890
13 minus 8 is 5.

00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:58.320
12 minus 7 is 5.

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:01.530
5 minus 5 is 0.

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:04.780
5 minus nothing is 5.

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:05.710
Bring down the 2.

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:13.090
So the answer is 25,055.

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:16.470
So let's do a problem now that
I think will confuse you a

00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:19.900
little bit more because the
borrowing isn't as easy.

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:22.480
You have to actually borrow
from a couple places.

00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:39.800
Let's say I had 37,002
minus-- let's say I had 155.

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:42.090
So the same drill.

00:05:42.090 --> 00:05:45.130
So this 2 is less than 5,
so we have to borrow.

00:05:45.130 --> 00:05:48.820
So this 2 will become a 12.

00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:51.930
But huh, there's a 0 here, so
you can't borrow from the 0.

00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:53.940
Some people will let you borrow
from the 0, but I think that

00:05:53.940 --> 00:05:56.103
just confuses things because
you can't borrow from the

00:05:56.103 --> 00:05:57.450
0, there's nothing there.

00:05:57.450 --> 00:05:59.710
So instead of borrowing from
the 0 we look to this 0.

00:05:59.710 --> 00:06:01.470
Well, there's still
nothing there.

00:06:01.470 --> 00:06:04.250
So now we look, oh,
there's a 7 here.

00:06:04.250 --> 00:06:07.620
So what we do is instead of
borrowing a 1 from the 0, which

00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:15.490
is hard to do, we borrow 1 from
this 700, from this whole 700.

00:06:15.490 --> 00:06:18.330
And what is 700 minus 1?

00:06:18.330 --> 00:06:19.480
Right, it's 699.

00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:26.710
So that 700 becomes 699.

00:06:26.710 --> 00:06:28.770
Cross all of this out.

00:06:28.770 --> 00:06:31.320
And now let's check
our numbers again.

00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:36.870
12 is larger than 5, nine is
larger than 5, 9 is larger than

00:06:36.870 --> 00:06:40.500
1, 6 is larger than nothing,
and 3 is larger than nothing,

00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:42.410
so we're ready to subtract.

00:06:42.410 --> 00:06:45.670
12 minus 5 is 7.

00:06:45.670 --> 00:06:48.730
9 minus 5 is 4.

00:06:48.730 --> 00:06:51.606
9 minus 1 is 8.

00:06:51.606 --> 00:06:54.180
6 minus nothing is 6.

00:06:54.180 --> 00:06:55.795
3 minus nothing is 3.

00:06:55.795 --> 00:06:57.630
So there, we're done.

00:06:57.630 --> 00:07:02.100
The answer is 36,847.

00:07:02.100 --> 00:07:05.851
I think we could have time
for one more problem.

00:07:05.851 --> 00:07:21.870
Let's say I had 3,201
minus-- let's say it's 502.

00:07:21.870 --> 00:07:22.950
Same drill.

00:07:22.950 --> 00:07:27.040
1 is less than 2, so
we have to borrow.

00:07:27.040 --> 00:07:28.370
Turn that into an 11.

00:07:28.370 --> 00:07:30.380
But you can't borrow from the
0, so you're going to have to

00:07:30.380 --> 00:07:33.000
borrow from this entire 20.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:34.800
Well, what's 20 minus 1?

00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:37.060
Right, it's 19.

00:07:37.060 --> 00:07:38.080
This becomes a 19.

00:07:40.660 --> 00:07:41.660
So let's check again.

00:07:41.660 --> 00:07:43.480
11 is greater than 2.

00:07:43.480 --> 00:07:44.320
Check.

00:07:44.320 --> 00:07:45.570
9 is greater than 0.

00:07:45.570 --> 00:07:46.620
Check.

00:07:46.620 --> 00:07:46.970
Uh-oh.

00:07:46.970 --> 00:07:49.310
1 is not greater than 5.

00:07:49.310 --> 00:07:50.840
So we have to borrow again.

00:07:50.840 --> 00:07:53.000
This 1 becomes an 11.

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:56.450
We borrowed from this
3, which becomes a 2.

00:07:56.450 --> 00:08:00.630
11 is greater than 2, 9 is
greater than 0, 11 is greater

00:08:00.630 --> 00:08:04.200
than 5, 2 is obviously greater
than nothing below it.

00:08:04.200 --> 00:08:06.100
So we're ready to subtract.

00:08:06.100 --> 00:08:09.130
11 minus 2 is 9.

00:08:09.130 --> 00:08:12.020
9 minus 0 is 9.

00:08:12.020 --> 00:08:14.470
11 minus 5 is 6.

00:08:14.470 --> 00:08:17.590
And 2 minus nothing is 2.

00:08:17.590 --> 00:08:26.480
So 3,201 minus 502
is equal to 2,699.

00:08:26.480 --> 00:08:28.340
I think you're now ready to
try some of the level 4

00:08:28.340 --> 00:08:29.110
subtraction problems.

00:08:29.110 --> 00:08:31.530
You just always have to
remember, do you're

00:08:31.530 --> 00:08:32.950
borrowing first.

00:08:32.950 --> 00:08:36.030
Make sure all the numbers on
top are larger than, or at

00:08:36.030 --> 00:08:38.620
least as large as all the
numbers on the bottom.

00:08:38.620 --> 00:08:40.720
And then you can just do your
subtraction like a normal

00:08:40.720 --> 00:08:42.010
subtraction problem.

00:08:42.010 --> 00:08:44.500
I hope you have some
fun doing this.

00:08:44.500 --> 00:08:46.090
Talk to you later.
