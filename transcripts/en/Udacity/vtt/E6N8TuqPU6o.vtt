00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:02.200
We can look at the software architecture from two

00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:07.120
main standpoints. There are prescriptive and descriptive software architectures.

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:09.900
So what does that mean? A prescriptive architecture captures

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:12.620
the design decisions that are made prior to the

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:15.398
system's construction. This is what we normally call the

00:00:15.398 --> 00:00:18.280
as-conceived software architecture. Conversely,

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:20.550
a descriptive architecture describes how

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:23.010
the system has actually been built. So it's based

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:25.860
on observing the system as it is and extracting

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:28.200
the architecture from the observation. This is what we call

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:31.890
the as-implemented software architecture. And one key point here is

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:35.780
that often, these two architectures, the prescriptive and the descriptive

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:39.290
architectures end up being different. So let's see why that happens.
