00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:02.060
All right. We're going to do a couple more definitions. This

00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:04.420
notion of a version space turns out to be really important

00:00:04.420 --> 00:00:07.400
in understanding how to analyze these algorithms. So, imagine we've got

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:12.320
some hypothesis, space H, capital H. And a true hypothesis that we're

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:14.970
trying to learn, C of H. This is also sometimes called

00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:18.580
a concept. And we're trying to learn from a training set

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:21.710
S, which is a subset of the possible inputs. And what

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:25.370
our training set consists of is those examples along with the true

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:27.790
class for all of those X's. So, at

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:29.965
any given time a learner might have some candidate

00:00:29.965 --> 00:00:33.390
hypothesis, little H and big H, and a learner

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:37.380
who produces a candidate hypothesis little H, such that

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:40.460
C of X is equal to H of X for all X of the training set, is

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:43.405
called a consistent learner. Right, so what would be

00:00:43.405 --> 00:00:47.330
another way of describing hat a consistent learner is?

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:49.000
&gt;&gt; A consistent learner can actually

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.080
learn the hypothesis, or the true concept.

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:53.480
&gt;&gt; Well it produces, right, I mean of all the possible things it could

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:56.770
return, it returns the one that matches the data that it's seen so far.

00:00:56.770 --> 00:00:58.810
&gt;&gt; Right, so it's consistent with the data. That makes sense.

00:00:58.810 --> 00:01:05.486
&gt;&gt; Yeah. And the version space is essentially the space of all the hypotheses

00:01:05.486 --> 00:01:08.584
that are like that, that are consistent with the data. So we'll say the

00:01:08.584 --> 00:01:11.329
version space for a given set of data S is going to be the

00:01:11.329 --> 00:01:13.098
set of hypotheses, that are in the

00:01:13.098 --> 00:01:16.270
hypothesis set, such that they're consistent with respect

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:18.230
to the samples that they're given.

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:19.142
&gt;&gt; Okay that makes sense.

00:01:19.142 --> 00:01:22.910
&gt;&gt; All right. Good. So I think what we'll do next is a quiz just to make

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:24.860
sure that we kind of get this concept and

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:26.570
how it works. And we'll do that next time.

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:27.890
&gt;&gt; Okay sure. I like quizzes.
