00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:06.430
We start off in life being very interested
in pleasure and fun. In our earliest years,

00:00:06.430 --> 00:00:11.200
we do little but hunt out situations that
will amuse us, pursuing our hedonistic goals

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:15.750
with the help of puddles, crayons, balls,
teddies, computers and bits and pieces we

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:20.519
find in the kitchen drawers. As soon as anything
gets frustrating or boring, we simply give

00:00:20.519 --> 00:00:25.789
up and go in search of new sources of enjoyment
– and no one appears to mind very much.

00:00:25.789 --> 00:00:31.900
Then, all of a sudden at the age of 5 or 6,
we are introduced to a terrifying new reality:

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:37.469
the Rule of Duty. This states that there are
some things, indeed many things, that we must

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:42.519
do not because we like or see the point of
them, but because other people, very intimidating

00:00:42.519 --> 00:00:48.129
authoritative people who may be almost three
times our size, expect us to do them – in

00:00:48.129 --> 00:00:52.440
order, so the big people sternly explain,
that we’ll be able to earn money, buy a

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:58.840
house and go on holiday about 30 years from
now. It sounds pretty important – sort of.

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:03.160
Even when we’re home and start crying and
tell our parents that we just don’t want

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:08.070
to do the essay for tomorrow, they may take
the side of Duty; and speak to us with anger

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:12.420
and impatience – beneath which there is
simply a lot of fear – about how people

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:17.090
who can’t complete a simple homework assignment
on volcanoes (and want to build a treehouse

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:23.710
instead) will never survive in the adult world.
Questions of what we actually enjoy doing,

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:29.200
what gives us pleasure, still occasionally
matter in childhood, but only a bit. They

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:34.570
become matters increasingly set aside from
the day-to-day world of study, reserved for

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:40.360
holidays and weekends. A basic distinction
takes hold: pleasure is for hobbies, pain

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:45.060
is for work. It’s no wonder that by the
time we finish university, this dichotomy

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:49.759
is so entrenched, we usually can’t conceive
of asking ourselves too vigorously what we

00:01:49.759 --> 00:01:54.439
might in our hearts want to do with our lives;
what it might be fun to do with the years

00:01:54.439 --> 00:01:59.649
that remain. It’s not the way we’ve learnt
to think. The rule of duty has been the governing

00:01:59.649 --> 00:02:05.430
ideology for 80% of our time on earth – and
it’s become our second nature. We are convinced

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:10.729
that a good job is meant to be substantially
dull, irksome and annoying. Why else would

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:16.441
someone pay us to do it? The dutiful way of
thinking has such high prestige, because it

00:02:16.441 --> 00:02:21.981
sounds like a road to safety in a competitive
and alarmingly expensive world. But the Rule

00:02:21.981 --> 00:02:28.491
of Duty is actually no guarantee of true security.
Once we’ve finished our education, it in

00:02:28.491 --> 00:02:35.750
fact emerges as a sheer liability masquerading
as a virtue. Duty grows positively dangerous.

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:40.640
The reasons are two-fold. Firstly, because
success in the modern economy will generally

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:46.140
only go to those who can bring extraordinary
dedication and imagination to their labours

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:49.870
– and this is only possible when one is,
to a large extent, having fun.

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:51.709
Only when we are intrinsically

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:56.720
motivated are we capable of generating the
very high levels of energy and brainpower

00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:03.519
necessary to stand out from the competition.
Work that has been produced merely out of duty will be limp and

00:03:03.519 --> 00:03:08.470
lacking next to that done out of love. The
other thing that happens when our work is

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:12.980
informed by our own sense of pleasure is that
we get more insightful about the pleasures

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:17.940
of others – that is, of the clients and
customers a business relies upon. We can best

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:24.269
please our audiences when we have mobilised
our own feelings of enjoyment. In other words,

00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:30.640
pleasure isn’t the opposite of work; it’s
a key ingredient of successful work. Yet we

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:35.220
have to recognise that asking ourselves what
we might really want to do – without any

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:40.500
immediate or primary consideration for money
or reputation – goes against our every,

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:45.849
educationally-embedded assumption about what
could possibly keep us safe – and is therefore

00:03:45.849 --> 00:03:50.970
rather scary. It takes immense insight and
maturity to stick with the truth: that we

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:56.010
will best serve others – and can make our
own greatest contribution to society – when

00:03:56.010 --> 00:04:03.130
we bring the most imaginative and most authentically
personal sides of our nature into our work.

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:09.640
Duty can guarantee us a basic income. Only
sincere, pleasure-led work can generate sizeable

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:14.700
success. When people are suffering under the
rule of duty, it can be helpful to take a

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:19.490
morbid turn and ask them to imagine what they
might think of their lives from the vantage

00:04:19.490 --> 00:04:25.230
point of their deathbeds. The thought of death
may usefully detach us from prevailing fears

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:30.330
of what others think. The prospect of the
end reminds us of an imperative higher still

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:37.910
than a duty to society: a duty to ourselves,
to our talents, to our interests and our passions.

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:43.350
The death-bed point of view can spur us to
perceive the hidden recklessness and danger

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:45.820
within the sensible dutiful path.
