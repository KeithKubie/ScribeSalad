00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Another one to take the forward Euler's method that you already know so well

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.000
and turned it into one of these wondrous methods that consist of phase space area.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000
Here I wrote down the equations for standard forward Euler's method.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Now, there is a single change that's going to do the job.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:25.000
I do not compute the force at the original position. I compute the force at the new position.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000
This leads to the following. This looks like a programming error on first sight.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:34.000
Soon, I'll be using the initial values on the right-hand side to compute the new values,

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:40.000
but actually, it turns out that this the right thing to be doing in contrast to the forward Euler's method.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:46.000
Now, these two steps are executed in sequence. First, we change the position.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
And you already saw that this does not change

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000
the area in phase space and then we take the new position.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
The velocity remained unchanged and compute the new velocity,

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:01.000
which also does not change the area in phase space, which we saw before

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
and then we repeat the first step and so on and so on.

00:01:04.000 --> 09:59:59.000
This is now a symplectic method. It does not change the area in phase space.
