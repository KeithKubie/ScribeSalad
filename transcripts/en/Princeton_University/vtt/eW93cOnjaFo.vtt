Tomorrow is your close
reading exercise number 3.

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:09.680
RAVEN DERAMUS: I love working
with teenagers, because I think

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:12.110
they just have so many
things in their brains

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:13.530
that they want to
say and get out.

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:16.170
And I love being able
to explore with them.

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:18.470
It's very, very exciting.

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:20.000
My name is Raven DeRamus.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.370
I'm a senior here at
Princeton, and I'm

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:26.480
teaching 11th-grade American
literature and journalism

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:28.050
at Princeton High School.

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:29.700
I just want you
to get in the habit

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:33.480
of thinking and questioning,
thinking and questioning.

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:34.870
OK?

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:35.370
All right.

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:38.770
So this is my first question.

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:40.310
It's just really crazy

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:42.870
that they didn't necessarily
trust me in the beginning,

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:44.650
because they didn't
know me as well.

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:46.990
But now they look
for me every day,

00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:50.550
and it's so great to see
them operating with me

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:53.950
as their guide, I guess.

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:55.550
KANOA MULLING: The Teacher
Prep program at Princeton

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:59.310
is a certificate
program that helps

00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:01.900
you to be prepared to
teach at the high school

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:05.850
level or the middle school level
in the subject of your choice.

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:09.540
And so there are a few classes
that Teacher Prep offers

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.290
that, if you want
to get certified

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:14.160
as a teacher in the state of
New Jersey, you take those,

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:16.680
and then you embark on your
student teaching experience.

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.840
And by the end, if
everything goes well,

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.490
you are certified in the
state of New Jersey to teach.

BARBARA FORTUNATO: While I was at Princeton,
I did know about Teacher Prep,

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:32.240
and I thought about being
a teacher at that point,

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:35.070
but it wasn't something that
I wanted to do right away.

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:38.730
After thinking about
it for a long time,

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:41.990
I decided that I really
wanted to pursue teaching.

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:46.690
And I thought that teaching
was a very difficult job,

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:49.070
and I really wanted to
go back to Princeton

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:52.630
to get support in learning
how to be a good teacher.

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:55.350
And so I found
Teacher Prep, and they

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:58.990
were very welcoming
to alums who wanted

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:00.500
to pursue a career of teaching.

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:02.370
What should the
angular momentum

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:05.930
be after he flips the wheel
when we consider the system?

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:06.980
STUDENTS: Still l.

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:09.050 position:56%
BARBARA FORTUNATO: Still l downward.

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:11.700
KANOA MULLING: I think my favorite
thing about teaching

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:17.060
is when I'm able to make that
connection of mutual trust

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:18.070
with a student.

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:20.800
And that can be
academic trust -- them

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:23.050
willing to show that they
need help on something, them

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:28.670
willing to show that they
want your advice on something

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:30.930
academically â€” and
that they trust

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:34.420
you to give that good advice.

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:39.870
RAVEN DERAMUS: So this backs up
our claim that pearl

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:42.550
could represent salvation.

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:44.690
Now that
I'm doing student teaching,

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:46.840
I realize that it's
really, really for me.

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:49.320
It just really took some
experimenting and reflecting

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:50.670
for me to get here.

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:54.140
And I appreciate that about
the Teacher Prep program.

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:57.130
They really make you
think a lot about why

00:02:57.130 --> 00:02:59.340
you're doing what you're
doing in the very beginning.

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:03.880
And so I really came to
terms with the kind of person

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:07.080
that I am, and the things
that I want out of life,

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:10.550
and people that I
want to interact with,

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:14.750
and what I imagine my days
being like on a daily basis.
