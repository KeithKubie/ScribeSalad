00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:04.920
You have aproximately a 171 billion total brain cells

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:06.540
86 billion of these are neurons

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:09.480
that process information, sense varied stimuli

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:10.520
and make you...

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:11.540
Well, you

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:13.880
But are there things in every day life

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:15.720
that reduce this count?

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:17.900
What will kill your brain cells?

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:19.880
We used to think that the brain couldn't

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:21.300
produce new neurons

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:25.180
Although neurons are stabled cell type, meaning they don't multiple themselves

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:28.460
We now know that new neurons are produced from neural stem cells

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:30.180
Throughout our life time

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:33.320
But this happens only in certain areas of our brain

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:36.060
Mainly in two small regions in the forebrain

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:38.240
So, while we can make new neurons

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:42.440
Brain cell death in large amounts may be dangerous and irreversible

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:45.800
For example, within 5 minutes of a good blow to the head

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:49.440
Axons are compressed and calcium rushes into your neurons

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:54.300
Which can signal a number of different pathways and enzymes to begin cell death

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:57.060
This may explain the confussion, lost of consciousness

00:00:57.060 --> 00:01:00.440
and sensitivity to sound or light common in a consussion

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.120
Getting enough zs?

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:05.300
Although the brain can react against short term sleep deprivation

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:08.340
A 2014 study showed too many all-nighters

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:11.540
may be killing neurons in the locus coeruleus

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:13.960
This a region of the brain responsible for coordinating

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:16.900
motivation, and maintaining attention and arousal

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:18.840
And after extended wake periods

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:23.200
we become unable to make important proteins to keep these neurons alive

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:26.120
But don't stress about that, literally

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:28.120
Long term stress has been associated with

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:30.020
damage to our hippocampus

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:32.980
And a reduced ability to make new neurons

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:36.880
which may explain why extreme stress can lead to numerous mental illnesses

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:40.700
Like depression, anxiety, PTSD and schizophrenia

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:43.480
Nicotine affects the hippocampus as well

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:46.740
Cutting the creation of new neurons by 50%

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:48.660
While also increasing cell death

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:51.680
Like the smell of gasoline or permanent markers?

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:54.100
Although they don't cause brain damage directly

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:56.600
Some of the chemicals in them are as asphyxiants

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:59.480
meaning it will despise oxygen from the air you breath

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:01.700
And deprive your tissues of oxygen!

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:03.720
Ultimately killing brain cells

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:06.640
Carbon dioxide, commonly released from stoves, furnaces,

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:09.760
grills and cars, works the same way

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:11.660
By hijacking your hemoglobin

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:14.180
which normally carries oxygen in your blood

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:16.860
Cells in major organs, like the brain and heart

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:19.180
will soffocate and die heightened of levels

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:21.200
But what about alcohol?

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:23.580
It appears that short term exposure to alcohol

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:25.360
doesn't kill brain cells!

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:28.480
But... It can reduce communication between them

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:31.280
And over a longer period, chronic alcohol consumption

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:34.940
can activate immune cells in the brain to produce pro inflammatory chemicals

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:37.740
and free radicals that can lead to cell death

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:42.920
Alcoholics can also develop a B-vitamin thiamine deficiency called Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:46.020
which can kill off brain cells and lead to memory problems,

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:48.780
amnesia and lack of muscle coordination

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:51.240
Taking a break from drinking may be the best way to

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:54.820
promote neural stem cell growth and other factors from neurogenesis

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:57.700
But no matter how much we might fear losing brain cells

00:02:57.700 --> 00:02:59.800
We might have no choice in the matter

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:05.260
Our brain declines by 5% of its volume per weight per decade after the age of 40

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:08.060
With the rate increasing around the age of 70

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:10.220
Most widely experienced is memory loss

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:12.340
which can be a normal part of aging

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:16.520
Overall, we shouln't be kept a night wondering how many brain cells we lost today

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:19.560
as losing them may be a sign that things are alright

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:22.640
During development we produce many more neurons than we need

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:26.480
and brain cells have to die to maintain the brain's complex organization

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:30.120
Research in rats suggest that we lose neurons in our prefontal cortex

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:34.140
as a way of reorganizing our brain during and after puberty

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:38.040
More neurons doesn't necessarily make for a better or a smarter person

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:41.220
And sometimes cell death makes for a healthy life

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:44.420
