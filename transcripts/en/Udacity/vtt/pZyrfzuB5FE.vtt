00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:02.860
Once we chain all these functions together,

00:00:02.860 --> 00:00:08.450
according to this pipeline the web browser takes this specification and renders

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:14.400
a web page filled with all the graphics that we've specified across the chain.

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:17.630
At its most fundamental level, the Grammar of Graphics makes

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:22.740
the distinction to separate content or data from the aesthetic.

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:26.210
In this case, the web page we're visualizing.

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:29.360
This may not seem like a ground breaking theory, but before the Grammar of

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:34.180
Graphics, researchers, artists, and developers often coupled the information

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:37.660
they were trying to communicate with the medium of communication.

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:40.680
That is all I want to touch on the Grammar of Graphics for now.

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:44.211
But I encourage all of you to look at the extra resources provided if

00:00:44.211 --> 00:00:47.866
you either want to dive deeper to what some of these specifications of

00:00:47.866 --> 00:00:51.980
the Grammar of Graphics mean, or the d3 functions that correspond to them.

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:57.130
We will re-visit this concept of separating data from presentation throughout

00:00:57.130 --> 00:01:01.730
the course, and is one of the most powerful design decisions of the d3 library.
