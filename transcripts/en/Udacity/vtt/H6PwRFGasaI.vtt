00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:03.430
The amazing thing about pedigrees is that a pedigree for

00:00:03.430 --> 00:00:06.580
any given trait, like lactose intolerance, will allow us to

00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:10.670
compare family relatedness with the prevalence of that trait. So

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:12.990
here, we see Kate, and she's affected, because we see

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:15.520
that here circle is filled in. We see her parents

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:18.280
are unaffected, because they're not shaded. Her brother is not

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:21.830
affected because he's not shaded. But, her maternal grandfather is

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:26.140
affected because His square is shaded and her paternal aunt,

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:30.110
her dad's sister is also shaded, also affected.

00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:32.150
The shading of these shapes in the pedigree

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:35.640
allows us to identify the phenotype, or the

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:39.050
observable condition or trait of an individual. So

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:43.090
in this pedigree, Kate's phenotype is lactose intolerance.

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:46.670
Whereas, her brother's phenotype is lactose tolerance. So

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:48.210
what other information do you think you could

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:51.220
get from this pedigree here, of Kate's family concerning

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:53.620
the trait of lactose intolerance? Take a look

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:55.950
at each of these particular options and then

00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:57.910
look at the pedigree, and determine whether or

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:00.730
not you think it's true. Check any and

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:03.680
all boxes that you think apply. Remember, if

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:06.490
you're affected, you're shaded in. Meaning that you

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:09.740
have lactose intolerance. And, if you're not shaded

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:12.700
in, you're unaffected, meaning you are lactose tolerant.
