1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,833
Well,
your,

2
00:00:01,440 --> 00:00:05,010
your concern is anti aging.

3
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:07,560
You certainly want people to live longer,

4
00:00:07,890 --> 00:00:12,480
but you yourself are more concerned with
your work than you are with your own

5
00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:17,090
personal life. Oh, 100%. My
wife will tell you that. Um,

6
00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:20,700
the reason that I look off to myself as
best I can when I've got the energy is,

7
00:00:21,350 --> 00:00:25,140
um, it would be a bad look if I died
from heart disease tomorrow. Yes.

8
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:30,420
The anti-aging guy. Well, if you died
from anything other than an accident,

9
00:00:30,810 --> 00:00:34,490
right? Yeah. All right. So I'm trying
to be a role model for others. Um,

10
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:37,680
but you know, I, if I, if I died
tomorrow, that'd be fine with me.

11
00:00:38,050 --> 00:00:41,910
I'd like to finish my work at least, uh,
I would like to leave something behind.

12
00:00:41,911 --> 00:00:46,911
But what I don't want to do is to be
a burden on my kids and my grandkids.

13
00:00:47,090 --> 00:00:50,250
Yeah. And so that's what I'm
also trying to prevent. Yeah.

14
00:00:50,251 --> 00:00:55,251
That would seem to me to be the real
final frontier of anti-aging is folks that

15
00:00:56,731 --> 00:00:57,570
are really,

16
00:00:57,571 --> 00:01:02,460
really old because it seems like they
would be open to try almost anything.

17
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:07,650
And if you could bring them back,
that would be Uber bizarre.

18
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:12,900
Right. How far away do you think we are
from doing something like that? While it,

19
00:01:12,901 --> 00:01:17,730
it often comes as a shock to people who
don't work on this that we're already

20
00:01:17,731 --> 00:01:20,670
testing these molecules in
clinical trials on elderly people.

21
00:01:21,330 --> 00:01:25,590
I've been doing that for a number of years
now, um, with some positive results. Um,

22
00:01:25,620 --> 00:01:28,560
over at Harvard we were
getting any man and,

23
00:01:28,580 --> 00:01:33,090
and another molecule called MIT be
66. Um, what's the other one called?

24
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:37,850
My laundry list so that the company's
called Metro Biotech and uh,

25
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:43,340
it makes Super Nad boosters and the
drug is called developmental drug is MIB

26
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:48,370
dash six two six six two
six. Yeah. And we're,

27
00:01:48,371 --> 00:01:51,730
we're hoping that it will not just
of g of that alleyway somewhere. Ah,

28
00:01:51,940 --> 00:01:56,790
or of that I got to go to some shady
doctor with a weird accent. Uh,

29
00:01:58,380 --> 00:02:02,020
that one, uh, that one we hope to
get on the market in about, uh,

30
00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:06,360
three years from now. Really? Yeah.
Foot for diseases, FDA approved.

31
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:11,430
And so they're using it right now on
old folks are testing it for safety.

32
00:02:11,431 --> 00:02:15,850
Yeah. But we're also going to be
testing later, uh, energy. Uh,

33
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:19,660
we can measure actually the Nad
levels, that molecule I mentioned. Um,

34
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:23,610
we can measure that in their muscles and
we'll test if that worked. Um, and we'll,

35
00:02:23,670 --> 00:02:27,150
we'll measure of course their insurance
because at the mice that we traded with

36
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:30,060
Nmn, uh, they just ran and ran and ran.

37
00:02:30,061 --> 00:02:32,970
They actually broke the little treadmill
in my lab because they ran so far.

38
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:36,860
And you're giving it to them orally or
you're injecting it to them? Uh, it's a,

39
00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:39,660
it's a little tablet.
They just put food,

40
00:02:40,170 --> 00:02:43,050
put it in their food or something
like that. All the mice. Yeah. Oh No,

41
00:02:43,110 --> 00:02:44,690
I thought you're talking about humans.
Uh,

42
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:49,300
in the mice we put in their drinking
water, Haley's trinkets, early easy. Wow.

43
00:02:49,910 --> 00:02:52,670
And they have no idea. No idea. Um,

44
00:02:52,690 --> 00:02:55,230
and in fact that people who are running
the treadmill have no idea which is

45
00:02:55,231 --> 00:02:55,890
which,

46
00:02:55,890 --> 00:02:59,920
but we had mice running three kilometers
and then the machine stopped and I get

47
00:02:59,921 --> 00:03:03,970
a text from the researcher, Hey,
the machine broke. And I said, uh,

48
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:04,911
check the software.

49
00:03:04,911 --> 00:03:08,200
And turns out software was written to
stop at three kilometers cause no mouse

50
00:03:08,201 --> 00:03:12,520
had run that far before. That's long.
And those are old mice. Don't forget,

51
00:03:12,521 --> 00:03:16,480
these are mice that equivalent or the
equivalent of a 65 year old human. Really?

52
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:20,790
Yeah. And we figured out why they
run further. This isn't just, uh,

53
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:23,320
try it and see.
We figured out that,

54
00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:26,500
that the lining of the blood
vessels needs nad as you get older.

55
00:03:26,850 --> 00:03:29,650
Well they need it all the time, but as
you get older you don't have enough nad.

56
00:03:30,130 --> 00:03:35,130
So the Nmn replenishes that and allows
the blood vessel lining to respond to

57
00:03:35,711 --> 00:03:40,390
exercise, um, and even grow blood vessels
if you don't exercise. And so those mice,

58
00:03:40,870 --> 00:03:43,750
they ran and ran around,
they didn't get lactate build up as much.

59
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:48,220
I just didn't feel tired. So in that
lactic acid buildup, right. Wow.

60
00:03:48,490 --> 00:03:52,960
So muscle fatigue would be different.
Uh,

61
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:56,730
well they didn't seem to get that either.
Wow. Is the just better blood flow?

62
00:03:56,970 --> 00:03:59,200
We even pinched off an artery,
uh,

63
00:03:59,310 --> 00:04:04,290
and the body responded much better
to restate restoring blood flow,

64
00:04:04,291 --> 00:04:08,520
which would be great for patients
who have a heart attack. Whoa.

65
00:04:08,610 --> 00:04:13,260
Now with human beings,
what has been the most dramatic result?

66
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:20,330
Uh, that's a hard question because
a lot of its early stage, um,

67
00:04:21,530 --> 00:04:23,900
we developed a molecule that,
uh,

68
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:28,910
seem to effectively treat a disease
called psoriasis, which is the,

69
00:04:29,150 --> 00:04:33,940
yeah. How's that? Yeah. So that, that,
that worked and that's a molecule.

70
00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:38,030
That's something you apply to the skin. It
was a, it was a pill actually. Hmm. Yeah.

71
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:40,990
Um, how does that work?
What does it doing? A,

72
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,690
so it's an activator of one of these
[inaudible] are two ones that we found in

73
00:04:44,691 --> 00:04:45,680
yeast originally.

74
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:50,330
These are two and protective enzymes in
the body and there are antiinflammatory

75
00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:52,460
and so that worked well
against that disease.

76
00:04:53,180 --> 00:04:55,580
So psoriasis has something
to do with inflammation.

77
00:04:56,290 --> 00:04:59,270
It isn't an inflammatory
disorder. Yup. Um,

78
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:03,770
are all autoimmune disorders anti
inflammatory based disorders?

79
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:06,320
I believe so. Really? Interesting.

80
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:08,433
Huh?

81
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:10,830
Cause I have a,
I have Videle ego.

82
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:14,340
You don't see that little spots on my
skin where I don't have a, any pigment,

83
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:18,390
it's genetic. My grandmother had it.
My grandmother sister had it. Um,

84
00:05:18,391 --> 00:05:22,340
I wonder if that would help me. Uh, yeah.

85
00:05:22,341 --> 00:05:26,570
I really couldn't say. What's
it called again? Which one?
The drug that was tested.

86
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:30,470
Yeah. Um, it has a name, s, r t 2104.

87
00:05:31,820 --> 00:05:34,270
And this is the stuff that
worked on psoriasis. Yeah.

88
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:36,320
In a small study in New York.
Yeah.

89
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:37,583
Hmm.

90
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:40,590
Now what other,
um,

91
00:05:40,710 --> 00:05:45,060
what other things had really a
dramatic results on humans? Well,

92
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:47,280
we're not there yet.
We don't have dramatic results.

93
00:05:47,310 --> 00:05:51,930
Is there anything promising results
on humans or then NMN and yes,

94
00:05:51,931 --> 00:05:56,190
there are there. So this
m tore I mentioned earlier
where, uh, the drug rapamycin,

95
00:05:56,191 --> 00:05:59,780
which is too dangerous,
try on normal people. Um,

96
00:05:59,810 --> 00:06:04,160
that drug has been tried on elderly people
and it boosted their immune system in

97
00:06:04,161 --> 00:06:08,000
the same way that you see with
calorie restricted mice. And so that,

98
00:06:08,001 --> 00:06:11,540
that was an early signal that you might
be able to reverse aspects of aging and

99
00:06:11,541 --> 00:06:12,500
the elderly with that truck.
