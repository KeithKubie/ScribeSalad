Now that we have a loaded image, we need to draw that image to the canvas via

00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:09.436
the canvas.drawImage API. This function takes the image object itself as well

00:00:09.448 --> 00:00:14.389
as the locations on the canvas that we'd like to draw that image. As you can

00:00:14.401 --> 00:00:18.079
see, there are some other parameters that drawImage takes. Don't worry about

00:00:18.091 --> 00:00:20.660
those just yet. For now you can leave those blank. By the way, if you are ever

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:24.715
interested in finding out more about an API for HTML5 development, make sure

00:00:24.745 --> 00:00:28.765
you check out webplatform.org. It's a nifty little space where all your

00:00:28.777 --> 00:00:32.871
questions can be answered. For our next step, why don't you go ahead and fill in

00:00:32.883 --> 00:00:35.890
the onLoad function that we defined earlier. So that rather than logging a

00:00:35.905 --> 00:00:41.473
message to the console, instead, it draws the image at pixel location 192 by 192.
