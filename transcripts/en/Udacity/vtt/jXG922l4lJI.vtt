 If our index document
is served over HTTPS, great.

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:05.960
But what about
the site's assets?

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:08.550
Are they surfed
over HTTPS as well?

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:11.040
A fast way to break that
beautiful green lock is

00:00:11.039 --> 00:00:14.009
having your assets
surfed over regular HTTP.

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:15.779
When this happens,
the site ends up

00:00:15.779 --> 00:00:18.059
in a state called mixed content.

00:00:18.059 --> 00:00:19.829
Mixed content
occurs when you open

00:00:19.829 --> 00:00:22.919
a website that is supposed
to be delivered over HTTPS,

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:25.500
but includes resources
like images, I-frame,

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:29.789
style sheets, or scripts,
from non-TLS secured origins.

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:31.890
A popular mistake
is pulling in jQuery

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:35.100
from a non-TLS enabled CDN.

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.760
 Depending on the type of
research that is being included

00:00:37.759 --> 00:00:40.859
over a non-secure channel,
the consequences might differ.

00:00:40.859 --> 00:00:42.600
It might cost you
your green padlock,

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.160
but still remain functional.

00:00:44.159 --> 00:00:46.949
The resource might get
blocked or break your page,

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:50.220
or it might even get the
horrible red padlock of shame.

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:52.448
The behavior differs
across different browsers

00:00:52.448 --> 00:00:54.239
so you should definitely
avoid it and check

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:56.109
a website for mixed content.

00:00:56.109 --> 00:00:59.159
In fact, Google recommends
that you surf all your assets

00:00:59.159 --> 00:01:00.659
over HTTPS.

00:01:00.659 --> 00:01:03.449
This way you'll avoid mixed
content warnings and your site

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:06.918
and its assets will be
transferred securely.
