00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:04.700
So we want to read in more stocks
into a combined dataframe.

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:10.540
Start with the code we used to build
our dataframe with the SPY data.

00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:14.090
Then define a list with
the required stock symbols.

00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:16.370
Now we can write a for loop to read and

00:00:16.370 --> 00:00:19.640
join each stock into
the dataframe just like SPY.

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:26.740
So here's the for loop which takes
each symbol in the symbols list and

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:29.300
joins it to our main dataframe.

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:30.930
Let's go ahead and print this.

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:32.600
Oops.

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:33.760
There is an error.

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:36.140
Reading the error message carefully,

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:42.550
we observe that index column
Adj Close has an overlap.

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:46.280
What is happening here is that,
irrespective of the stock

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:50.860
the column we are extracting
each time is named Adj Close.

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:55.590
So the join method is confused as
to what to name it in the result.

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:57.050
Column names must be unique.

00:00:58.270 --> 00:00:59.800
As professor described earlier,

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:05.280
we would like each stock symbol as
the corresponding column name or header.

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:08.190
So we add these two lines.

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:12.970
This renames the column Adj Close
to the respective stock symbol.

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:14.830
Now let's see the output.

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:17.240
Here you go,
everything is finally in place.
