00:07:55.730 --> 00:07:55.740
in the post-soviet period particularly
 

00:07:55.740 --> 00:07:58.730
in the post-soviet period particularly
in places like Kazakhstan where there's

00:07:58.730 --> 00:07:58.740
in places like Kazakhstan where there's
 

00:07:58.740 --> 00:08:01.610
in places like Kazakhstan where there's
a notion of a region which brings

00:08:01.610 --> 00:08:01.620
a notion of a region which brings
 

00:08:01.620 --> 00:08:03.530
a notion of a region which brings
together both Europe and Asia so it's

00:08:03.530 --> 00:08:03.540
together both Europe and Asia so it's
 

00:08:03.540 --> 00:08:06.020
together both Europe and Asia so it's
not fully European and it doesn't have

00:08:06.020 --> 00:08:06.030
not fully European and it doesn't have
 

00:08:06.030 --> 00:08:07.520
not fully European and it doesn't have
to be it doesn't have to follow a

00:08:07.520 --> 00:08:07.530
to be it doesn't have to follow a
 

00:08:07.530 --> 00:08:10.520
to be it doesn't have to follow a
European model at but at the same time

00:08:10.520 --> 00:08:10.530
European model at but at the same time
 

00:08:10.530 --> 00:08:13.010
European model at but at the same time
it opens doors to Asia for Europe and

00:08:13.010 --> 00:08:13.020
it opens doors to Asia for Europe and
 

00:08:13.020 --> 00:08:14.719
it opens doors to Asia for Europe and
things like that and Kazakhstan itself

00:08:14.719 --> 00:08:14.729
things like that and Kazakhstan itself
 

00:08:14.729 --> 00:08:18.170
things like that and Kazakhstan itself
is officially bridging between I mean

00:08:18.170 --> 00:08:18.180
is officially bridging between I mean
 

00:08:18.180 --> 00:08:19.760
is officially bridging between I mean
geographically bridging because the

00:08:19.760 --> 00:08:19.770
geographically bridging because the
 

00:08:19.770 --> 00:08:21.530
geographically bridging because the
western part is in what is officially

00:08:21.530 --> 00:08:21.540
western part is in what is officially
 

00:08:21.540 --> 00:08:23.650
western part is in what is officially
known as Europe being west of the ER all

00:08:23.650 --> 00:08:23.660
known as Europe being west of the ER all
 

00:08:23.660 --> 00:08:29.270
known as Europe being west of the ER all
river and and so there's this idea of

00:08:29.270 --> 00:08:29.280
river and and so there's this idea of
 

00:08:29.280 --> 00:08:31.340
river and and so there's this idea of
something that's that's not fully

00:08:31.340 --> 00:08:31.350
something that's that's not fully
 

00:08:31.350 --> 00:08:33.680
something that's that's not fully
European and it's okay that that's not

00:08:33.680 --> 00:08:33.690
European and it's okay that that's not
 

00:08:33.690 --> 00:08:35.839
European and it's okay that that's not
but also opens doors to Asia and

00:08:35.839 --> 00:08:35.849
but also opens doors to Asia and
 

00:08:35.849 --> 00:08:38.089
but also opens doors to Asia and
connects with places further east that's

00:08:38.089 --> 00:08:38.099
connects with places further east that's
 

00:08:38.099 --> 00:08:40.430
connects with places further east that's
something that's become quite common and

00:08:40.430 --> 00:08:40.440
something that's become quite common and
 

00:08:40.440 --> 00:08:42.110
something that's become quite common and
these are all things that figure into

00:08:42.110 --> 00:08:42.120
these are all things that figure into
 

00:08:42.120 --> 00:08:44.120
these are all things that figure into
the current imaginations of the region

00:08:44.120 --> 00:08:44.130
the current imaginations of the region
 

00:08:44.130 --> 00:08:46.810
the current imaginations of the region
as well that is how Central Asians and

00:08:46.810 --> 00:08:46.820
as well that is how Central Asians and
 

00:08:46.820 --> 00:08:48.880
as well that is how Central Asians and
want to think of themselves as connected

00:08:48.880 --> 00:08:48.890
want to think of themselves as connected
 

00:08:48.890 --> 00:08:52.180
want to think of themselves as connected
with other parts of the world there's of

00:08:52.180 --> 00:08:52.190
with other parts of the world there's of
 

00:08:52.190 --> 00:08:54.520
with other parts of the world there's of
course another definition of Eurasia

00:08:54.520 --> 00:08:54.530
course another definition of Eurasia
 

00:08:54.530 --> 00:08:56.110
course another definition of Eurasia
which has become quite common and that's

00:08:56.110 --> 00:08:56.120
which has become quite common and that's
 

00:08:56.120 --> 00:08:58.060
which has become quite common and that's
basically euphemism for the former

00:08:58.060 --> 00:08:58.070
basically euphemism for the former
 

00:08:58.070 --> 00:08:59.530
basically euphemism for the former
Soviet Union we don't want to use a

00:08:59.530 --> 00:08:59.540
Soviet Union we don't want to use a
 

00:08:59.540 --> 00:09:01.570
Soviet Union we don't want to use a
negative category like the former Soviet

00:09:01.570 --> 00:09:01.580
negative category like the former Soviet
 

00:09:01.580 --> 00:09:06.070
negative category like the former Soviet
Union so we say your age instead but of

00:09:06.070 --> 00:09:06.080
Union so we say your age instead but of
 

00:09:06.080 --> 00:09:09.010
Union so we say your age instead but of
course it has the same semantic impact

00:09:09.010 --> 00:09:09.020
course it has the same semantic impact
 

00:09:09.020 --> 00:09:11.050
course it has the same semantic impact
ultimately because we're failing to

00:09:11.050 --> 00:09:11.060
ultimately because we're failing to
 

00:09:11.060 --> 00:09:13.150
ultimately because we're failing to
define something in any other way

00:09:13.150 --> 00:09:13.160
define something in any other way
 

00:09:13.160 --> 00:09:14.710
define something in any other way
besides the fact that it's it's the

00:09:14.710 --> 00:09:14.720
besides the fact that it's it's the
 

00:09:14.720 --> 00:09:16.510
besides the fact that it's it's the
former Soviet Union in that context and

00:09:16.510 --> 00:09:16.520
former Soviet Union in that context and
 

00:09:16.520 --> 00:09:19.270
former Soviet Union in that context and
in another way that this figures for

00:09:19.270 --> 00:09:19.280
in another way that this figures for
 

00:09:19.280 --> 00:09:21.520
in another way that this figures for

at Harvard the Eurasia of course is the

00:09:27.130 --> 00:09:27.140
at Harvard the Eurasia of course is the
 

00:09:27.140 --> 00:09:29.110
at Harvard the Eurasia of course is the
the rest of the of the former Soviet

the rest of the of the former Soviet
 

00:09:29.120 --> 00:09:31.660
the rest of the of the former Soviet
Union so everything besides Russia and

00:09:31.660 --> 00:09:31.670
Union so everything besides Russia and
 

00:09:31.670 --> 00:09:33.970
Union so everything besides Russia and
it particularly tends to be thought of

00:09:33.970 --> 00:09:33.980
it particularly tends to be thought of
 

00:09:33.980 --> 00:09:36.580
it particularly tends to be thought of
as the southern part so set the Central

00:09:36.580 --> 00:09:36.590
as the southern part so set the Central
 

00:09:36.590 --> 00:09:38.410
as the southern part so set the Central
Asian the Caucasus the parts that I'll

00:09:38.410 --> 00:09:38.420
Asian the Caucasus the parts that I'll
 

00:09:38.420 --> 00:09:41.050
Asian the Caucasus the parts that I'll
be talking about primarily today but

00:09:41.050 --> 00:09:41.060
be talking about primarily today but
 

00:09:41.060 --> 00:09:42.520
be talking about primarily today but
again this is sort of a negative

00:09:42.520 --> 00:09:42.530
again this is sort of a negative
 

00:09:42.530 --> 00:09:44.380
again this is sort of a negative
definition of taking out Russia out of

00:09:44.380 --> 00:09:44.390
definition of taking out Russia out of
 

00:09:44.390 --> 00:09:49.720

the framework of concepts and then yet

the framework of concepts and then yet
 

00:09:49.730 --> 00:09:54.730

another idea that that is used as a way

00:09:54.730 --> 00:09:54.740
another idea that that is used as a way
 

00:09:54.740 --> 00:09:57.010
another idea that that is used as a way
of appealing to a new kind of unity

00:09:57.010 --> 00:09:57.020
of appealing to a new kind of unity
 

00:09:57.020 --> 00:09:58.980
of appealing to a new kind of unity
across the region and a rationale for

00:09:58.980 --> 00:09:58.990
across the region and a rationale for
 

00:09:58.990 --> 00:10:02.110
across the region and a rationale for
building links that connect for example

00:10:02.110 --> 00:10:02.120
building links that connect for example
 

00:10:02.120 --> 00:10:03.910
building links that connect for example

00:10:03.920 --> 00:10:06.760
the Muslim regions of the former Soviet
Union not with Islam but rather with

something that really is the former
 

00:10:09.830 --> 00:10:13.330
something that really is the former
Soviet Union but a rationale for for

and these are very dynamically moving

00:10:27.970 --> 00:10:27.980

narrowly when I first established the
program on Central Asia at Harvard I

00:10:43.600 --> 00:10:43.610
program on Central Asia at Harvard I
 

00:10:43.610 --> 00:10:44.980
program on Central Asia at Harvard I
just called it Central Asia and

00:10:44.980 --> 00:10:44.990
just called it Central Asia and
 

00:10:44.990 --> 00:10:47.740
just called it Central Asia and
everything from the Crimea to Mongolia

00:10:47.740 --> 00:10:47.750
everything from the Crimea to Mongolia
 

00:10:47.750 --> 00:10:50.410
everything from the Crimea to Mongolia
sort of very broad definition but the

00:10:50.410 --> 00:10:50.420
sort of very broad definition but the
 

00:10:50.420 --> 00:10:51.790
sort of very broad definition but the
problem with that of course is that some

00:10:51.790 --> 00:10:51.800
problem with that of course is that some
 

00:10:51.800 --> 00:10:53.020
problem with that of course is that some
of these people don't want to be called

00:10:53.020 --> 00:10:53.030
of these people don't want to be called
 

00:10:53.030 --> 00:10:55.360
of these people don't want to be called
Central Asians but for example in the

00:10:55.360 --> 00:10:55.370
Central Asians but for example in the
 

00:10:55.370 --> 00:10:56.650
Central Asians but for example in the
Caucasus they don't think of themselves

00:10:56.650 --> 00:10:56.660
Caucasus they don't think of themselves
 

00:10:56.660 --> 00:10:58.690
Caucasus they don't think of themselves
as being Central Asia although for

00:10:58.690 --> 00:10:58.700
as being Central Asia although for
 

00:10:58.700 --> 00:10:59.820

Central Asian survey has always

00:11:02.970 --> 00:11:02.980
Central Asian survey has always
 

00:11:02.980 --> 00:11:04.500
Central Asian survey has always
considered the Caucasus to be just as

00:11:04.500 --> 00:11:04.510
considered the Caucasus to be just as
 

00:11:04.510 --> 00:11:07.530
considered the Caucasus to be just as
much part of its territory as his other

00:11:07.530 --> 00:11:07.540
much part of its territory as his other
 

00:11:07.540 --> 00:11:10.350
much part of its territory as his other
parts so there's a sort of an ambivalent

00:11:10.350 --> 00:11:10.360
parts so there's a sort of an ambivalent
 

00:11:10.360 --> 00:11:13.500
parts so there's a sort of an ambivalent
relationship to the term Central Asia in

00:11:13.500 --> 00:11:13.510
relationship to the term Central Asia in

think rather oddly into English as

think rather oddly into English as
 

00:11:25.840 --> 00:11:30.210
think rather oddly into English as
middle asia and that is it what in the

middle asia and that is it what in the
 

00:11:30.220 --> 00:11:32.220
middle asia and that is it what in the
russian context it was usually referred

00:11:32.220 --> 00:11:32.230
russian context it was usually referred
 

00:11:32.230 --> 00:11:34.200
russian context it was usually referred
to as central asian and kazakhstan so

00:11:34.200 --> 00:11:34.210
to as central asian and kazakhstan so
 

00:11:34.210 --> 00:11:36.780
to as central asian and kazakhstan so
basically it's the five republics that

we now tend to call central asia plus

we now tend to call central asia plus
 

00:11:39.210 --> 00:11:42.000
we now tend to call central asia plus

being ill defined first of all and
 

00:14:47.140 --> 00:14:49.079
being ill defined first of all and
therefore you can you can define it you

00:14:49.079 --> 00:14:49.089
therefore you can you can define it you
 

00:14:49.089 --> 00:14:51.210

00:15:40.130 --> 00:15:40.140
tend to be referred to as central naazia
 

00:15:40.140 --> 00:15:42.280
tend to be referred to as central naazia
plus the Caucasus so three southern

00:15:42.280 --> 00:15:42.290
plus the Caucasus so three southern
 

00:15:42.290 --> 00:15:44.960
plus the Caucasus so three southern
southern Caucasus Republic's south of

00:15:44.960 --> 00:15:44.970
southern Caucasus Republic's south of
 

00:15:44.970 --> 00:15:47.660
southern Caucasus Republic's south of
the the Caucasus mountain range here and

00:15:47.660 --> 00:15:47.670
the the Caucasus mountain range here and
 

00:15:47.670 --> 00:15:50.390
the the Caucasus mountain range here and
of course what that does is cuts off the

00:15:50.390 --> 00:15:50.400
of course what that does is cuts off the
 

00:15:50.400 --> 00:15:51.800
of course what that does is cuts off the
North Caucasus which in many ways is

00:15:51.800 --> 00:15:51.810
North Caucasus which in many ways is
 

00:15:51.810 --> 00:15:53.900
North Caucasus which in many ways is
very closely connected with that region

00:15:53.900 --> 00:15:53.910
very closely connected with that region
 

00:15:53.910 --> 00:15:58.280
very closely connected with that region
and it cuts off other things which I'll

00:15:58.280 --> 00:15:58.290
and it cuts off other things which I'll
 

00:15:58.290 --> 00:16:06.310
and it cuts off other things which I'll
show you on another map in the moment

00:16:06.310 --> 00:16:06.320
 

00:16:06.320 --> 00:16:09.110
but of course one of the ways that we

00:16:09.110 --> 00:16:09.120
but of course one of the ways that we
 

00:16:09.120 --> 00:16:10.970
but of course one of the ways that we
tend to think about this region is not

00:16:10.970 --> 00:16:10.980
tend to think about this region is not
 

00:16:10.980 --> 00:16:13.940
tend to think about this region is not
so much about about geography but about

00:16:13.940 --> 00:16:13.950
so much about about geography but about
 

00:16:13.950 --> 00:16:15.650
so much about about geography but about
who the people are that lived there and

00:16:15.650 --> 00:16:15.660
who the people are that lived there and
 

00:16:15.660 --> 00:16:18.980
who the people are that lived there and
this is one way to cut or to describe

00:16:18.980 --> 00:16:18.990
this is one way to cut or to describe
 

00:16:18.990 --> 00:16:20.540
this is one way to cut or to describe
the medicine to think about their

00:16:20.540 --> 00:16:20.550
the medicine to think about their
 

00:16:20.550 --> 00:16:23.030
the medicine to think about their
religious affiliation and indeed this

00:16:23.030 --> 00:16:23.040
religious affiliation and indeed this
 

00:16:23.040 --> 00:16:24.500
religious affiliation and indeed this
has been one of the dominant frameworks

00:16:24.500 --> 00:16:24.510
has been one of the dominant frameworks
 

00:16:24.510 --> 00:16:25.940
has been one of the dominant frameworks
for thinking about this part of the

00:16:25.940 --> 00:16:25.950
for thinking about this part of the
 

00:16:25.950 --> 00:16:29.450
for thinking about this part of the
world since Soviet times that is to

00:16:29.450 --> 00:16:29.460
world since Soviet times that is to
 

00:16:29.460 --> 00:16:31.460
world since Soviet times that is to
think about it is the Muslim part of the

00:16:31.460 --> 00:16:31.470
think about it is the Muslim part of the
 

00:16:31.470 --> 00:16:33.200
think about it is the Muslim part of the
former Soviet Union or the Soviet Union

00:16:33.200 --> 00:16:33.210
former Soviet Union or the Soviet Union
 

00:16:33.210 --> 00:16:36.320
former Soviet Union or the Soviet Union
at the time and what you have on this

00:16:36.320 --> 00:16:36.330
at the time and what you have on this
 

00:16:36.330 --> 00:16:39.140
at the time and what you have on this
map is the the density or the percentage

00:16:39.140 --> 00:16:39.150
map is the the density or the percentage
 

00:16:39.150 --> 00:16:42.770
map is the the density or the percentage
of population who are Muslims according

00:16:42.770 --> 00:16:42.780
of population who are Muslims according
 

00:16:42.780 --> 00:16:44.720

the second-to-last Soviet census and the
 

00:16:50.520 --> 00:16:54.170
the second-to-last Soviet census and the
the darker colors are very dense Muslim

00:16:54.170 --> 00:16:54.180
the darker colors are very dense Muslim
 

00:16:54.180 --> 00:16:55.640
the darker colors are very dense Muslim
populations where I mean this is a

00:16:55.640 --> 00:16:55.650
populations where I mean this is a
 

00:16:55.650 --> 00:16:57.050
populations where I mean this is a
little bit less and then as you go

00:16:57.050 --> 00:16:57.060
little bit less and then as you go
 

00:16:57.060 --> 00:16:58.430
little bit less and then as you go
further north towards the Arctic Circle

00:16:58.430 --> 00:16:58.440
further north towards the Arctic Circle
 

00:16:58.440 --> 00:17:01.100
further north towards the Arctic Circle
you get small percentages of the

00:17:01.100 --> 00:17:01.110
you get small percentages of the
 

00:17:01.110 --> 00:17:02.480
you get small percentages of the
population of course doesn't mean

00:17:02.480 --> 00:17:02.490
population of course doesn't mean
 

00:17:02.490 --> 00:17:03.560
population of course doesn't mean
there's a lot of Muslims up in the

00:17:03.560 --> 00:17:03.570
there's a lot of Muslims up in the
 

00:17:03.570 --> 00:17:06.140
there's a lot of Muslims up in the
Arctic Circle they're just part of the

00:17:06.140 --> 00:17:06.150
Arctic Circle they're just part of the
 

00:17:06.150 --> 00:17:08.030
Arctic Circle they're just part of the
same administrative unit that the this

00:17:08.030 --> 00:17:08.040
same administrative unit that the this
 

00:17:08.040 --> 00:17:12.290
same administrative unit that the this
map is is marking out but there actually

00:17:12.290 --> 00:17:12.300
map is is marking out but there actually
 

00:17:12.300 --> 00:17:14.270
map is is marking out but there actually
are quite a few Muslims in the Arctic

00:17:14.270 --> 00:17:14.280
are quite a few Muslims in the Arctic
 

00:17:14.280 --> 00:17:16.460
are quite a few Muslims in the Arctic
Circle now because of labor migration

00:17:16.460 --> 00:17:16.470
Circle now because of labor migration
 

00:17:16.470 --> 00:17:18.530
Circle now because of labor migration
and this began already during Soviet

00:17:18.530 --> 00:17:18.540
and this began already during Soviet
 

00:17:18.540 --> 00:17:21.949
and this began already during Soviet
times friends in northern tajikistan who

throughout soviet I mean throughout the
 

00:17:24.240 --> 00:17:26.060
throughout soviet I mean throughout the
late soviet period and into the

00:17:34.010 --> 00:17:34.020
time and another place that on this
 

00:17:34.020 --> 00:17:35.960

matter should be marked as Moscow itself
 

00:17:35.970 --> 00:17:38.570
matter should be marked as Moscow itself
because of course there's a huge Muslim

00:17:38.570 --> 00:17:38.580
because of course there's a huge Muslim
 

00:17:38.580 --> 00:17:41.090
because of course there's a huge Muslim
population in Moscow and in other cities

00:17:41.090 --> 00:17:41.100
population in Moscow and in other cities
 

00:17:41.100 --> 00:17:42.590

there wasn't Soviet times and there is

00:17:42.590 --> 00:17:42.600
there wasn't Soviet times and there is
 

00:17:42.600 --> 00:17:46.490
there wasn't Soviet times and there is
now as well the of course this way of

00:17:46.490 --> 00:17:46.500
now as well the of course this way of
 

00:17:46.500 --> 00:17:48.500
now as well the of course this way of
thinking about things divides the

00:17:48.500 --> 00:17:48.510
thinking about things divides the
 

00:17:48.510 --> 00:17:50.090
thinking about things divides the
Caucasus so you have the Christian

00:17:50.090 --> 00:17:50.100
Caucasus so you have the Christian
 

00:17:50.100 --> 00:17:52.070
Caucasus so you have the Christian
Caucasus and the Muslim Caucasus

00:17:52.070 --> 00:17:52.080
Caucasus and the Muslim Caucasus
 

00:17:52.080 --> 00:17:54.740

Azerbaijan and and the Northern Caucasus

Azerbaijan and and the Northern Caucasus
 

00:17:54.750 --> 00:17:56.630
Azerbaijan and and the Northern Caucasus
being predominantly Muslim populations

00:17:56.630 --> 00:17:56.640
being predominantly Muslim populations
 

00:17:56.640 --> 00:17:58.160
being predominantly Muslim populations
especially in the Western at the eastern

00:17:58.160 --> 00:17:58.170
especially in the Western at the eastern
 

00:17:58.170 --> 00:18:02.500
especially in the Western at the eastern
part Georgia and Armenia being Christian

00:18:02.500 --> 00:18:02.510
part Georgia and Armenia being Christian
 

00:18:02.510 --> 00:18:04.790
part Georgia and Armenia being Christian
even more so now than they were during

00:18:04.790 --> 00:18:04.800
even more so now than they were during
 

00:18:04.800 --> 00:18:07.520
even more so now than they were during
Soviet times because of the flights of

00:18:07.520 --> 00:18:07.530
Soviet times because of the flights of
 

00:18:07.530 --> 00:18:11.000
Soviet times because of the flights of
population between Republic's now this

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:11.010
population between Republic's now this
 

00:18:11.010 --> 00:18:12.710
population between Republic's now this
map shows the different way of thinking

00:18:12.710 --> 00:18:12.720
map shows the different way of thinking
 

00:18:12.720 --> 00:18:14.690
map shows the different way of thinking
about the world and I'm not sure

00:18:14.690 --> 00:18:14.700
about the world and I'm not sure
 

00:18:14.700 --> 00:18:16.100
about the world and I'm not sure
actually I don't really quite understand

00:18:16.100 --> 00:18:16.110
actually I don't really quite understand
 

00:18:16.110 --> 00:18:17.480
actually I don't really quite understand
what they're trying to do with this map

00:18:17.480 --> 00:18:17.490
what they're trying to do with this map
 

00:18:17.490 --> 00:18:20.630
what they're trying to do with this map
but it gives an example of how people

00:18:20.630 --> 00:18:20.640
but it gives an example of how people
 

00:18:20.640 --> 00:18:23.720
but it gives an example of how people
have tried to reconcile Asia's position

00:18:23.720 --> 00:18:23.730
have tried to reconcile Asia's position
 

00:18:23.730 --> 00:18:26.060
have tried to reconcile Asia's position
within the wider world here we have a

00:18:26.060 --> 00:18:26.070
within the wider world here we have a
 

00:18:26.070 --> 00:18:28.990
within the wider world here we have a
map that connects Kenya and Kazakhstan

00:18:28.990 --> 00:18:29.000
map that connects Kenya and Kazakhstan
 

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:30.950
map that connects Kenya and Kazakhstan
not something that the people in

00:18:30.950 --> 00:18:30.960
not something that the people in
 

00:18:30.960 --> 00:18:32.420
not something that the people in
Kazakhstan would probably be that keen

00:18:32.420 --> 00:18:32.430
Kazakhstan would probably be that keen
 

00:18:32.430 --> 00:18:33.890
Kazakhstan would probably be that keen
to to do I mean they don't see

00:18:33.890 --> 00:18:33.900
to to do I mean they don't see
 

00:18:33.900 --> 00:18:35.270
to to do I mean they don't see
themselves as being belonging to that

00:18:35.270 --> 00:18:35.280
themselves as being belonging to that
 

00:18:35.280 --> 00:18:36.950
themselves as being belonging to that
same part of the world but I think it

00:18:36.950 --> 00:18:36.960
same part of the world but I think it
 

00:18:36.960 --> 00:18:39.320
same part of the world but I think it
reflects also this way of thinking about

00:18:39.320 --> 00:18:39.330
reflects also this way of thinking about
 

00:18:39.330 --> 00:18:43.040
reflects also this way of thinking about
the world is as being vulnerable to

00:18:43.040 --> 00:18:43.050
the world is as being vulnerable to
 

00:18:43.050 --> 00:18:44.990
the world is as being vulnerable to
Islam actually I mean that's what this

00:18:44.990 --> 00:18:45.000
Islam actually I mean that's what this
 

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:47.650
Islam actually I mean that's what this
map is about is the way that Islam can

00:18:47.650 --> 00:18:47.660
map is about is the way that Islam can
 

00:18:47.660 --> 00:18:51.500
map is about is the way that Islam can
extend from fundamentalist states in

00:18:51.500 --> 00:18:51.510
extend from fundamentalist states in
 

00:18:51.510 --> 00:18:54.670
extend from fundamentalist states in
Sudan Anna and other parts of the

00:18:54.670 --> 00:18:54.680
Sudan Anna and other parts of the
 

00:18:54.680 --> 00:18:58.220
Sudan Anna and other parts of the
Islamic world and connect and pose a

00:18:58.220 --> 00:18:58.230
Islamic world and connect and pose a
 

00:18:58.230 --> 00:19:00.140
Islamic world and connect and pose a
certain kind of danger for for Central

00:19:00.140 --> 00:19:00.150
certain kind of danger for for Central
 

00:19:00.150 --> 00:19:06.230
certain kind of danger for for Central
Asia as well well the color the fact

00:19:06.230 --> 00:19:06.240
Asia as well well the color the fact
 

00:19:06.240 --> 00:19:08.060
Asia as well well the color the fact
that it's not gray means that they're

00:19:08.060 --> 00:19:08.070
that it's not gray means that they're
 

00:19:08.070 --> 00:19:10.610
that it's not gray means that they're
trying to focus on this region but the

00:19:10.610 --> 00:19:10.620
trying to focus on this region but the
 

00:19:10.620 --> 00:19:12.230
trying to focus on this region but the
rest of the colors are just I think

00:19:12.230 --> 00:19:12.240
rest of the colors are just I think
 

00:19:12.240 --> 00:19:19.649
rest of the colors are just I think
mapmakers choice of a good pattern

00:19:19.649 --> 00:19:19.659
 

00:19:19.659 --> 00:19:22.419
but taking us back to the Soviet context

00:19:22.419 --> 00:19:22.429
but taking us back to the Soviet context
 

00:19:22.429 --> 00:19:24.130
but taking us back to the Soviet context
of the Christmas is the Soviet Union and

00:19:24.130 --> 00:19:24.140
of the Christmas is the Soviet Union and
 

00:19:24.140 --> 00:19:28.390
of the Christmas is the Soviet Union and
and what you see here is is I mean what

00:19:28.390 --> 00:19:28.400
and what you see here is is I mean what
 

00:19:28.400 --> 00:19:29.740
and what you see here is is I mean what
comes out clearly on this map is that

00:19:29.740 --> 00:19:29.750
comes out clearly on this map is that
 

00:19:29.750 --> 00:19:31.960
comes out clearly on this map is that
there are certain areas where where it's

00:19:31.960 --> 00:19:31.970
there are certain areas where where it's
 

00:19:31.970 --> 00:19:34.029
there are certain areas where where it's
not Russia so starting with Kazakhstan

when when Russia and Britain were making
 

00:31:54.010 --> 00:31:56.310
when when Russia and Britain were making
deals and they sent joint expeditions up

00:31:56.310 --> 00:31:56.320
deals and they sent joint expeditions up
 

00:31:56.320 --> 00:31:59.279
deals and they sent joint expeditions up
to these very remote regions for example

00:31:59.279 --> 00:31:59.289
to these very remote regions for example
 

00:31:59.289 --> 00:32:01.919
to these very remote regions for example
where they made made agreements about

00:32:01.919 --> 00:32:01.929
where they made made agreements about
 

00:32:01.929 --> 00:32:03.779
where they made made agreements about
where the boundaries would fall in

00:32:03.779 --> 00:32:03.789
where the boundaries would fall in
 

00:32:03.789 --> 00:32:05.490
where the boundaries would fall in
territories which were very remote from

00:32:05.490 --> 00:32:05.500
territories which were very remote from
 

00:32:05.500 --> 00:32:07.830
territories which were very remote from
their control actually but they they

00:32:07.830 --> 00:32:07.840
their control actually but they they
 

00:32:07.840 --> 00:32:09.930
their control actually but they they
made these decisions ultimately they

00:32:09.930 --> 00:32:09.940
made these decisions ultimately they
 

00:32:09.940 --> 00:32:11.880
made these decisions ultimately they
decided that that Russia should not have

00:32:11.880 --> 00:32:11.890
decided that that Russia should not have
 

00:32:11.890 --> 00:32:14.430
decided that that Russia should not have
a common boundary with with Britain and

00:32:14.430 --> 00:32:14.440
a common boundary with with Britain and
 

00:32:14.440 --> 00:32:17.640
a common boundary with with Britain and
so they made the Wakhan corridor which

00:32:17.640 --> 00:32:17.650
so they made the Wakhan corridor which
 

00:32:17.650 --> 00:32:19.490
so they made the Wakhan corridor which
extends its the eastern bit of

00:32:19.490 --> 00:32:19.500
extends its the eastern bit of
 

00:32:19.500 --> 00:32:21.930
extends its the eastern bit of
Afghanistan which extends between the

00:32:21.930 --> 00:32:21.940
Afghanistan which extends between the
 

00:32:21.940 --> 00:32:27.149
Afghanistan which extends between the
bulk of Afghanistan and China so so this

00:32:27.149 --> 00:32:27.159
bulk of Afghanistan and China so so this
 

00:32:27.159 --> 00:32:29.370
bulk of Afghanistan and China so so this
was all a part of the the Imperial

shows how it was gradually incorporated

00:32:42.779 --> 00:32:42.789
shows how it was gradually incorporated
 

00:32:42.789 --> 00:32:45.419
shows how it was gradually incorporated
within the Russian state so here you

00:32:45.419 --> 00:32:45.429
within the Russian state so here you
 

00:32:45.429 --> 00:32:49.200
within the Russian state so here you

00:33:03.669 --> 00:33:05.220
and they were incorporated on the
somewhat different basis from most of

which retained independence right up

which retained independence right up
until the revolution though they were

until the revolution though they were
 

00:33:21.760 --> 00:33:24.390
until the revolution though they were
heavily dominated by Russia and with for

example trade agreements which required

00:33:26.039 --> 00:33:26.049
example trade agreements which required
 

00:33:26.049 --> 00:33:28.049
example trade agreements which required
them to do trade with with Russia not

00:33:28.049 --> 00:33:28.059
them to do trade with with Russia not

with blade places in south and so on but

00:33:31.380 --> 00:33:31.390
with blade places in south and so on but
 

00:33:31.390 --> 00:33:33.510
with blade places in south and so on but
but Russia had very limited capacity in

00:33:33.510 --> 00:33:33.520
but Russia had very limited capacity in
 

00:33:33.520 --> 00:33:34.919
but Russia had very limited capacity in
this region at this time and right up

00:33:34.919 --> 00:33:34.929
this region at this time and right up
 

00:33:34.929 --> 00:33:37.169
this region at this time and right up
until the early 20th century there were

00:33:37.169 --> 00:33:37.179
until the early 20th century there were
 

00:33:37.179 --> 00:33:39.690
until the early 20th century there were
limited numbers of Russians in the

00:33:39.690 --> 00:33:39.700
limited numbers of Russians in the
 

00:33:39.700 --> 00:33:43.470
limited numbers of Russians in the
southern part of Central Asia and and I

00:33:43.470 --> 00:33:43.480
southern part of Central Asia and and I
 

00:33:43.480 --> 00:33:46.169
southern part of Central Asia and and I
think Russia fell very far away at the

00:33:46.169 --> 00:33:46.179
think Russia fell very far away at the
 

00:33:46.179 --> 00:33:51.760
think Russia fell very far away at the
time

00:33:51.760 --> 00:33:51.770
 

00:33:51.770 --> 00:33:56.650
quickly just in the interest of time

00:33:56.650 --> 00:33:56.660
 

00:33:56.660 --> 00:34:00.380
okay so so these are 19th century maps

00:34:00.380 --> 00:34:00.390
okay so so these are 19th century maps
 

00:34:00.390 --> 00:34:02.720
okay so so these are 19th century maps
and you see here the situation again a

00:34:02.720 --> 00:34:02.730
and you see here the situation again a
 

00:34:02.730 --> 00:34:06.230
and you see here the situation again a
map which shows european russia is being

00:34:06.230 --> 00:34:06.240
map which shows european russia is being
 

00:34:06.240 --> 00:34:09.170
map which shows european russia is being
distinct from from the asian part of

00:34:09.170 --> 00:34:09.180

russian you have asian russia here

00:34:10.460 --> 00:34:10.470
russian you have asian russia here
 

00:34:10.470 --> 00:34:13.940
russian you have asian russia here
marked in yellow and interestingly they

00:34:13.940 --> 00:34:13.950
marked in yellow and interestingly they
 

00:34:13.950 --> 00:34:15.890
marked in yellow and interestingly they
don't mark eva and Bukhara as being

00:34:15.890 --> 00:34:15.900
don't mark eva and Bukhara as being
 

00:34:15.900 --> 00:34:17.510
don't mark eva and Bukhara as being
independent state so the fact that they

00:34:17.510 --> 00:34:17.520
independent state so the fact that they
 

00:34:17.520 --> 00:34:19.040
independent state so the fact that they
were independent really didn't mean too

00:34:19.040 --> 00:34:19.050
were independent really didn't mean too
 

00:34:19.050 --> 00:34:20.930

time and of course the whole process of
 

00:34:25.470 --> 00:34:27.290

gradually have a wonderful map of this

00:34:32.690 --> 00:34:32.700
gradually have a wonderful map of this
 

00:34:32.700 --> 00:34:35.360
gradually have a wonderful map of this
region which represents the region in

00:34:35.360 --> 00:34:35.370
region which represents the region in
 

00:34:35.370 --> 00:34:37.790
region which represents the region in
medieval times and their big areas that

medieval times and their big areas that
 

00:34:37.800 --> 00:34:40.700
medieval times and their big areas that
are just marked terra incognita they

what's going on daunting me here okay

00:34:54.440 --> 00:34:54.450
what's going on daunting me here okay

what's going on daunting me here okay
and then in 1924 you have the creation

00:34:57.590 --> 00:34:57.600
and then in 1924 you have the creation
 

00:34:57.600 --> 00:34:59.840
and then in 1924 you have the creation
of the Republic's more or less as they

00:34:59.840 --> 00:34:59.850
of the Republic's more or less as they
 

00:34:59.850 --> 00:35:02.480
of the Republic's more or less as they
they are today that is there was a

00:35:02.480 --> 00:35:02.490
they are today that is there was a
 

00:35:02.490 --> 00:35:04.580
they are today that is there was a
process that extended from 1924 until

00:35:04.580 --> 00:35:04.590
process that extended from 1924 until
 

00:35:04.590 --> 00:35:08.260
process that extended from 1924 until
the end of the night 1930s during which

00:35:08.260 --> 00:35:08.270
the end of the night 1930s during which
 

00:35:08.270 --> 00:35:12.170
the end of the night 1930s during which
basically all the soviet socialist

00:35:12.170 --> 00:35:12.180
basically all the soviet socialist
 

00:35:12.180 --> 00:35:14.690
basically all the soviet socialist
republics of say for example kyrgyzstan

00:35:14.690 --> 00:35:14.700
republics of say for example kyrgyzstan
 

00:35:14.700 --> 00:35:17.120
republics of say for example kyrgyzstan
or Kyrgyz soviet socialist republic

process by which they were established
 

00:35:22.200 --> 00:35:24.260
process by which they were established
was an interesting one but I already

00:35:24.260 --> 00:35:24.270
was an interesting one but I already
 

00:35:24.270 --> 00:35:26.480
was an interesting one but I already
showed you how complicated the the

00:35:26.480 --> 00:35:26.490
showed you how complicated the the
 

00:35:26.490 --> 00:35:28.550
showed you how complicated the the
ethnic map of the region is and indeed

00:35:28.550 --> 00:35:28.560
ethnic map of the region is and indeed
 

00:35:28.560 --> 00:35:30.440
ethnic map of the region is and indeed
it's very complicated and and yet they

00:35:30.440 --> 00:35:30.450
it's very complicated and and yet they
 

00:35:30.450 --> 00:35:33.980
it's very complicated and and yet they
were trying to represent the ethnic

00:35:33.980 --> 00:35:33.990
were trying to represent the ethnic
 

00:35:33.990 --> 00:35:35.420
were trying to represent the ethnic
distribution in some way they decided

00:35:35.420 --> 00:35:35.430
distribution in some way they decided
 

00:35:35.430 --> 00:35:37.630
distribution in some way they decided
that they would base this division on

00:35:37.630 --> 00:35:37.640
that they would base this division on
 

00:35:37.640 --> 00:35:39.590
that they would base this division on
national characteristics as they were

creation of Uzbekistan we're a very
large part of that was black population

00:36:07.250 --> 00:36:07.260
large part of that was black population

large part of that was black population
where people at that time who would have

00:36:09.230 --> 00:36:09.240
where people at that time who would have
 

00:36:09.240 --> 00:36:10.790

all and it's only been gradually that

00:36:15.350 --> 00:36:15.360
all and it's only been gradually that

all and it's only been gradually that
people have come to accept the

people have come to accept the

people have come to accept the
designations which which were given and

designations which which were given and
 

00:36:20.160 --> 00:36:21.680
designations which which were given and
that's further complicated by the fact

00:36:21.680 --> 00:36:21.690
that's further complicated by the fact
 

00:36:21.690 --> 00:36:24.320
that's further complicated by the fact
that the their distribution on the

that the their distribution on the
 

00:36:24.330 --> 00:36:28.340
that the their distribution on the
ground was quite mosaic lake and in some

ground was quite mosaic lake and in some
 

00:36:28.350 --> 00:36:30.740
ground was quite mosaic lake and in some
way this map you can emphasize is how

00:36:30.740 --> 00:36:30.750
way this map you can emphasize is how
 

00:36:30.750 --> 00:36:32.870
way this map you can emphasize is how
what kind of a mosaic it was and how

00:36:32.870 --> 00:36:32.880
what kind of a mosaic it was and how
 

00:36:32.880 --> 00:36:34.460
what kind of a mosaic it was and how
they seemed to be trying to grab bits of

they seemed to be trying to grab bits of

they seemed to be trying to grab bits of

00:36:49.720 --> 00:36:49.730
 

00:36:49.730 --> 00:36:53.120
it's not in any way equivalent to that

it's not in any way equivalent to that
 

00:36:53.130 --> 00:36:55.280
it's not in any way equivalent to that
and part of the reason is because well

00:36:55.280 --> 00:36:55.290
and part of the reason is because well

where they they fit into this framework
but it was much more ambiguous when they

00:37:06.350 --> 00:37:06.360
but it was much more ambiguous when they
 

00:37:06.360 --> 00:37:08.960
but it was much more ambiguous when they
created these these Republic's and and

created these these Republic's and and
 

00:37:08.970 --> 00:37:11.000
created these these Republic's and and
there were many groups which actually

there were many groups which actually
 

00:37:11.010 --> 00:37:12.980
there were many groups which actually
could have gone either way at the time

could have gone either way at the time
 

00:37:12.990 --> 00:37:14.510
could have gone either way at the time
and one a good example of that is the

00:37:14.510 --> 00:37:14.520

there's much more ambiguity there were

at the time that it would became the
capital there was they gave no city to

capital there was they gave no city to

capital there was they gave no city to
to the first version of Tajikistan and

to the first version of Tajikistan and
 

00:37:55.770 --> 00:37:58.340
to the first version of Tajikistan and
as a result they had to create a capital

00:37:58.340 --> 00:37:58.350
as a result they had to create a capital
 

00:37:58.350 --> 00:38:02.630
as a result they had to create a capital
and they invited a lot of Tajikistan

00:38:02.630 --> 00:38:02.640
and they invited a lot of Tajikistan

years ago but when one thing that I want
 

00:38:29.310 --> 00:38:30.770
years ago but when one thing that I want
to emphasize about this map is that

00:38:30.770 --> 00:38:30.780
to emphasize about this map is that
 

00:38:30.780 --> 00:38:33.440
to emphasize about this map is that
though it's very regulated right the

00:38:33.440 --> 00:38:33.450
though it's very regulated right the
 

00:38:33.450 --> 00:38:34.880
though it's very regulated right the
boundaries are it seemed to be grabbing

00:38:34.880 --> 00:38:34.890
boundaries are it seemed to be grabbing
 

00:38:34.890 --> 00:38:36.980
boundaries are it seemed to be grabbing
bits of population but they don't always

00:38:36.980 --> 00:38:36.990
bits of population but they don't always
 

00:38:36.990 --> 00:38:39.110
bits of population but they don't always
do logical things like this bit I mean

00:38:39.110 --> 00:38:39.120
do logical things like this bit I mean
 

00:38:39.120 --> 00:38:41.090
do logical things like this bit I mean
this is the red is becca ston right but

00:38:41.090 --> 00:38:41.100
this is the red is becca ston right but
 

00:38:41.100 --> 00:38:45.160
this is the red is becca ston right but
this bit is actually a Tajik Enclave and

00:38:45.160 --> 00:38:45.170
this bit is actually a Tajik Enclave and
 

00:38:45.170 --> 00:38:47.720
this bit is actually a Tajik Enclave and
they gave it to his background run no

00:38:47.720 --> 00:38:47.730
they gave it to his background run no
 

00:38:47.730 --> 00:38:50.390
they gave it to his background run no
reasons it's actually very close to

00:38:50.390 --> 00:38:50.400
reasons it's actually very close to
 

00:38:50.400 --> 00:38:51.890
reasons it's actually very close to
Tajikistan so they could easily have

00:38:51.890 --> 00:38:51.900
Tajikistan so they could easily have
 

00:38:51.900 --> 00:38:53.900
Tajikistan so they could easily have
connected it with tajikistan then the

00:38:53.900 --> 00:38:53.910
connected it with tajikistan then the
 

00:38:53.910 --> 00:38:55.190
connected it with tajikistan then the
next thing they did was this is the

00:38:55.190 --> 00:38:55.200
next thing they did was this is the
 

00:38:55.200 --> 00:38:57.010
next thing they did was this is the
1930s version of the map

00:38:57.010 --> 00:38:57.020
1930s version of the map
 

00:38:57.020 --> 00:38:59.230
1930s version of the map
next thing I did was actually take this

00:38:59.230 --> 00:38:59.240
next thing I did was actually take this
 

00:38:59.240 --> 00:39:01.360
next thing I did was actually take this
territory give it to Kyrgyzstan create

00:39:01.360 --> 00:39:01.370
territory give it to Kyrgyzstan create
 

00:39:01.370 --> 00:39:03.280
territory give it to Kyrgyzstan create
an island here this is also an island

00:39:03.280 --> 00:39:03.290
an island here this is also an island
 

00:39:03.290 --> 00:39:05.680
an island here this is also an island
and and so you have even more

00:39:05.680 --> 00:39:05.690
and and so you have even more
 

00:39:05.690 --> 00:39:07.030
and and so you have even more
complicated boundaries than were

00:39:07.030 --> 00:39:07.040
complicated boundaries than were
 

00:39:07.040 --> 00:39:09.100
complicated boundaries than were
established in this first version of the

00:39:09.100 --> 00:39:09.110
established in this first version of the
 

00:39:09.110 --> 00:39:11.380
established in this first version of the
boundaries of the time but the other

00:39:11.380 --> 00:39:11.390
boundaries of the time but the other
 

00:39:11.390 --> 00:39:12.670
boundaries of the time but the other
thing to note about this is that the

00:39:12.670 --> 00:39:12.680
thing to note about this is that the
 

00:39:12.680 --> 00:39:13.840
thing to note about this is that the
boundaries hardly mattered until

00:39:13.840 --> 00:39:13.850
boundaries hardly mattered until
 

00:39:13.850 --> 00:39:16.050
boundaries hardly mattered until
nineteen ninety one they they were

00:39:18.370 --> 00:39:18.380

internal boundaries within Soviet Union
had some economic administrative

00:39:20.800 --> 00:39:20.810
had some economic administrative
 

00:39:20.810 --> 00:39:23.130
had some economic administrative
significance but for the most part

00:39:23.130 --> 00:39:23.140
significance but for the most part
 

00:39:23.140 --> 00:39:26.380
significance but for the most part
people really didn't even know where the

00:39:26.380 --> 00:39:26.390
people really didn't even know where the
 

00:39:26.390 --> 00:39:27.700
people really didn't even know where the
boundaries were and I did a lot of work

00:39:27.700 --> 00:39:27.710
boundaries were and I did a lot of work
 

00:39:27.710 --> 00:39:29.710
boundaries were and I did a lot of work
in the Fergana Valley actually in the in

00:39:29.710 --> 00:39:29.720
in the Fergana Valley actually in the in

they didn't know what Republic they were

living in just after that they started
putting big fences and mines and things

00:39:44.920 --> 00:39:44.930
putting big fences and mines and things
 

00:39:44.930 --> 00:39:46.120
putting big fences and mines and things
like that around the borders of

00:39:46.120 --> 00:39:46.130
like that around the borders of
 

00:39:46.130 --> 00:39:48.340
like that around the borders of
Uzbekistan so people started to know

00:39:48.340 --> 00:39:48.350
Uzbekistan so people started to know
 

00:39:48.350 --> 00:39:50.410
Uzbekistan so people started to know
very well where the boundaries fell and

00:39:50.410 --> 00:39:50.420
very well where the boundaries fell and
 

00:39:50.420 --> 00:39:51.790
very well where the boundaries fell and
sometimes it just cut right in the

00:39:51.790 --> 00:39:51.800
sometimes it just cut right in the
 

00:39:51.800 --> 00:39:53.830
sometimes it just cut right in the
middle of a house these houses actually

00:39:53.830 --> 00:39:53.840
middle of a house these houses actually
 

00:39:53.840 --> 00:39:57.730
middle of a house these houses actually
got to be useful monetary sources

00:39:57.730 --> 00:39:57.740
got to be useful monetary sources
 

00:39:57.740 --> 00:39:59.680

because you could sneak people through
 

00:39:59.690 --> 00:40:02.800
because you could sneak people through
the boundary so there are lots of ways

00:40:02.800 --> 00:40:02.810
the boundary so there are lots of ways
 

00:40:02.810 --> 00:40:04.360
the boundary so there are lots of ways
to get across the boundaries that beyond

00:40:04.360 --> 00:40:04.370
to get across the boundaries that beyond
 

00:40:04.370 --> 00:40:06.730

and the kind of thing that you were

00:42:28.550 --> 00:42:28.560
and the kind of thing that you were
 

00:42:28.560 --> 00:42:29.900

suggesting they would want to dissipate
 

00:42:29.910 --> 00:42:31.760

the early 15th century of course as I
 

00:54:42.410 --> 00:54:43.390
the early 15th century of course as I
mentioned there have been many many

00:54:43.390 --> 00:54:43.400

about why the region is important I mean

00:54:50.460 --> 00:54:50.470
about why the region is important I mean

one of the reasons why we hear about

00:54:53.050 --> 00:54:53.060
one of the reasons why we hear about
 

00:54:53.060 --> 00:54:54.609
one of the reasons why we hear about
them is because they wrote about it and

00:54:54.609 --> 00:54:54.619
them is because they wrote about it and
 

00:54:54.619 --> 00:54:56.710
them is because they wrote about it and
they were trying to sell their their

women the women of families which we're
 

01:11:47.130 --> 01:11:48.680
women the women of families which we're
trying to make a point of showing their

01:11:48.680 --> 01:11:48.690
trying to make a point of showing their
 

01:11:48.690 --> 01:11:50.330
trying to make a point of showing their
wealth by showing how they could have

01:11:50.330 --> 01:11:50.340
wealth by showing how they could have
 

01:11:50.340 --> 01:11:53.180
wealth by showing how they could have
their women isolated in this way but

01:11:53.180 --> 01:11:53.190
their women isolated in this way but
 

01:11:53.190 --> 01:11:55.609
their women isolated in this way but
most women had a much more public

01:11:55.609 --> 01:11:55.619
most women had a much more public
 

01:11:55.619 --> 01:11:59.779
most women had a much more public
involvement but but of course lots of

01:11:59.779 --> 01:11:59.789
involvement but but of course lots of
 

01:11:59.789 --> 01:12:01.129
involvement but but of course lots of
different kinds of transformations and

01:12:01.129 --> 01:12:01.139
different kinds of transformations and
 

01:12:01.139 --> 01:12:03.259
different kinds of transformations and
and Westerners were also enthusiastic

01:12:03.259 --> 01:12:03.269
and Westerners were also enthusiastic
 

01:12:03.269 --> 01:12:04.600
and Westerners were also enthusiastic
about some of these for example the

01:12:04.600 --> 01:12:04.610
about some of these for example the
 

01:12:04.610 --> 01:12:06.709
about some of these for example the
bicycle on the step and that sort of

01:12:06.709 --> 01:12:06.719
bicycle on the step and that sort of
 

01:12:06.719 --> 01:12:10.959
bicycle on the step and that sort of
thing and especially of course the

01:12:10.959 --> 01:12:10.969
thing and especially of course the
 

01:12:10.969 --> 01:12:14.330
thing and especially of course the
introduction of education of women girls

01:12:14.330 --> 01:12:14.340
introduction of education of women girls
 

01:12:14.340 --> 01:12:18.290
introduction of education of women girls
and this is indeed one of the huge

01:12:18.290 --> 01:12:18.300
and this is indeed one of the huge
 

01:12:18.300 --> 01:12:21.020
and this is indeed one of the huge
successes as many people view it of the

01:12:21.020 --> 01:12:21.030
successes as many people view it of the
 

01:12:21.030 --> 01:12:24.410
successes as many people view it of the
Soviet project when the very few people

01:12:24.410 --> 01:12:24.420
Soviet project when the very few people
 

01:12:24.420 --> 01:12:25.970
Soviet project when the very few people
in Central Asia would want to go back on

01:12:25.970 --> 01:12:25.980
in Central Asia would want to go back on
 

01:12:25.980 --> 01:12:27.979
in Central Asia would want to go back on
now even if they view other aspects of

now even if they view other aspects of
 

01:12:27.989 --> 01:12:31.390
now even if they view other aspects of
Soviet experience negatively now the

Soviet experience negatively now the
discourse is about Central Asia and the

01:12:34.220 --> 01:12:34.230
discourse is about Central Asia and the
 

01:12:34.230 --> 01:12:39.020
discourse is about Central Asia and the
Caucasus that emerged in Western writing

01:12:39.020 --> 01:12:39.030
Caucasus that emerged in Western writing
 

01:12:39.030 --> 01:12:43.279

of course it contained a lot of critical
 

01:12:43.289 --> 01:12:46.009
of course it contained a lot of critical
elements and there there are two threads

01:12:46.009 --> 01:12:46.019
elements and there there are two threads
 

01:12:46.019 --> 01:12:48.169
elements and there there are two threads
of critical discourse that pertain

01:12:48.169 --> 01:12:48.179
of critical discourse that pertain
 

01:12:48.179 --> 01:12:51.410

so for example the discourse about Islam
 

01:13:35.600 --> 01:13:38.230
so for example the discourse about Islam
is that it was basically completely

01:13:38.230 --> 01:13:38.240
is that it was basically completely
 

01:13:38.240 --> 01:13:40.420

parallel discourse that emerges in the

parallel discourse that emerges in the
 

01:13:53.960 --> 01:13:56.290
parallel discourse that emerges in the
same writings both by Bennigsen and many

01:13:56.290 --> 01:13:56.300
same writings both by Bennigsen and many
 

01:13:56.300 --> 01:13:58.660

others writing about the Soviet Union

central asia during this period that is
that there is a very strong impulse of

that there is a very strong impulse of
 

01:14:04.040 --> 01:14:05.740
that there is a very strong impulse of
traditionalism in the region which

01:14:05.740 --> 01:14:05.750
traditionalism in the region which
 

01:14:05.750 --> 01:14:09.190
traditionalism in the region which
resists soviet ization and so Bennigsen

01:14:09.190 --> 01:14:09.200
resists soviet ization and so Bennigsen
 

01:14:09.200 --> 01:14:12.160
resists soviet ization and so Bennigsen
himself talks about how dramatically

01:14:12.160 --> 01:14:12.170

of things that we were talking about

of things that we were talking about
earlier that the notion of divide and

ultimately being emasculated and

think about the Soviet Union today also

01:15:30.850 --> 01:15:30.860
think about the Soviet Union today also
 

01:15:30.860 --> 01:15:33.130
think about the Soviet Union today also
it embodies this kind of contradictory

01:15:33.130 --> 01:15:33.140
it embodies this kind of contradictory
 

01:15:33.140 --> 01:15:35.530
it embodies this kind of contradictory
thinking that is thinking about Soviet

01:15:35.530 --> 01:15:35.540
thinking that is thinking about Soviet
 

01:15:35.540 --> 01:15:37.150
thinking that is thinking about Soviet
times and their impact on Central Asia

01:15:37.150 --> 01:15:37.160
times and their impact on Central Asia
 

01:15:37.160 --> 01:15:40.030
times and their impact on Central Asia
on the one hand suggesting that Central

Asians really are intensely traditional
 

01:15:42.230 --> 01:15:44.220
Asians really are intensely traditional
and it's quite natural that they

01:15:44.220 --> 01:15:44.230
and it's quite natural that they
 

01:15:44.230 --> 01:15:48.000

on but at the same time the notion that
