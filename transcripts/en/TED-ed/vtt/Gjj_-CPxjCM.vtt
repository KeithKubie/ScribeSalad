00:00:07.079 --> 00:00:10.020
"Beauty is a curse," Psyche thought

00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:15.170
as she looked over the cliff's edge
where she'd been abandoned by her father.

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:18.760
She'd been born with the physical
perfection so complete

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:25.060
that she was worshipped as a new
incarnation of Venus, the goddess of love.

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:30.861
But real-life human lovers were
too intimidated even to approach her.

00:00:30.861 --> 00:00:34.312
When her father asked for guidance
from the Oracle of Apollo,

00:00:34.312 --> 00:00:36.942
the god of light, reason, and prophecy.

00:00:36.942 --> 00:00:40.572
He was told to abandon his daughter
on a rocky crag

00:00:40.572 --> 00:00:47.463
where she would marry a cruel
and savage serpent-like winged evil.

00:00:47.463 --> 00:00:51.584
Alone on the crag, Psyche felt
Zephyr the West Wind

00:00:51.584 --> 00:00:54.773
gently lifting her into the air.

00:00:54.773 --> 00:00:57.823
It set her down before a palace.

00:00:57.823 --> 00:01:02.563
"You are home," she heard 
an unseen voice say.

00:01:02.563 --> 00:01:08.243
"Your husband awaits you
in the bedroom, if you dare to meet him."

00:01:08.243 --> 00:01:12.353
She was brave enough, Psyche told herself.

00:01:12.353 --> 00:01:16.163
The bedroom was so dark that she
couldn't see her husband.

00:01:16.163 --> 00:01:19.194
But he didn't feel serpent-like at all.

00:01:19.194 --> 00:01:23.364
His skin was soft,
and his voice and manner were gentle.

00:01:23.364 --> 00:01:25.334
She asked him who he was,

00:01:25.334 --> 00:01:29.834
but he told her this was the one question
he could never answer.

00:01:29.834 --> 00:01:35.205
If she loved him, 
she would not need to know.

00:01:35.205 --> 00:01:39.016
His visits continued night after night.

00:01:39.016 --> 00:01:42.556
Before long, Psyche was pregnant.

00:01:42.556 --> 00:01:46.235
She rejoiced, but was also conflicted.

00:01:46.235 --> 00:01:51.147
How could she raise her baby
with a man she'd never seen?

00:01:51.147 --> 00:01:57.017
That night, Psyche approached
her sleeping husband holding an oil lamp.

00:01:57.017 --> 00:01:59.706
What she found was the god Cupid

00:01:59.706 --> 00:02:03.106
who sent gods and humans 
lusting after each other

00:02:03.106 --> 00:02:06.198
with the pinpricks of his arrows.

00:02:06.198 --> 00:02:12.117
Psyche dropped her lamp,
burning Cupid with hot oil.

00:02:12.117 --> 00:02:16.137
He said he'd been in love with Psyche
ever since his jealous mother, Venus,

00:02:16.137 --> 00:02:21.107
asked him to embarrass the young woman
by pricking her with an arrow.

00:02:21.107 --> 00:02:26.328
But taken with Psyche's beauty, Cupid
used the arrow on himself.

00:02:26.328 --> 00:02:31.469
He didn't believe, however, that gods
and humans could love as equals.

00:02:31.469 --> 00:02:36.330
Now that she knew his true form,
their hopes for happiness were dashed,

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:40.519
so he flew away.

00:02:40.519 --> 00:02:45.189
Psyche was left in despair until
the unseen voice returned

00:02:45.189 --> 00:02:48.070
and told her that it was indeed possible

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:52.741
for her and Cupid 
to love each other as equals.

00:02:52.741 --> 00:02:55.430
Encouraged, she set out to find him.

00:02:55.430 --> 00:03:00.860
But Venus intercepted Psyche and said
she and Cupid could only wed

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:05.541
if she completed a series 
of impossible tasks.

00:03:05.541 --> 00:03:12.741
First, Psyche was told to sort a huge,
messy pile of seeds in a single night.

00:03:12.741 --> 00:03:15.200
Just as she was abandoning hope,

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:20.622
an ant colony took pity on her
and helped with the work.

00:03:20.622 --> 00:03:22.810
Successfully passing the first trial,

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:26.782
Psyche next had to bring Venus
the fleece of the golden sheep,

00:03:26.782 --> 00:03:30.923
who had a reputation for 
disemboweling stray adventurers,

00:03:30.923 --> 00:03:33.012
but a river god showed her how to collect

00:03:33.012 --> 00:03:35.883
the fleece the sheep 
had snagged on briars,

00:03:35.883 --> 00:03:39.032
and she succeeded.

00:03:39.032 --> 00:03:42.473
Finally, Psyche had to travel
to the Underworld

00:03:42.473 --> 00:03:45.644
and convince Proserpina, 
queen of the dead,

00:03:45.644 --> 00:03:50.324
to put a drop of her beauty in a box
for Venus.

00:03:50.324 --> 00:03:54.602
Once again, the unseen voice came
to Psyche's aide.

00:03:54.602 --> 00:04:00.374
It told her to bring barley cakes for
Cerberus, the guard dog to the Underworld

00:04:00.374 --> 00:04:08.234
and coins to pay the boatman, Charon
to ferry her across the river Styx.

00:04:08.234 --> 00:04:11.214
With her third and final task complete,

00:04:11.214 --> 00:04:15.525
Psyche returned to the land of the living.

00:04:15.525 --> 00:04:21.476
Just outside Venus's palace, she opened
the box of Proserpina's beauty,

00:04:21.476 --> 00:04:24.736
hoping to keep some for herself.

00:04:24.736 --> 00:04:28.597
But the box was filled with sleep,
not beauty,

00:04:28.597 --> 00:04:32.417
and Psyche collapsed in the road.

00:04:32.417 --> 00:04:37.786
Cupid, now recovered from his wounds,
flew to his sleeping bride.

00:04:37.786 --> 00:04:41.166
He told her he'd been wrong and foolish.

00:04:41.166 --> 00:04:43.508
Her fearlessness in the face
of the unknown

00:04:43.508 --> 00:04:48.147
proved that she was more than his equal.

00:04:48.147 --> 00:04:55.467
Cupid gave Psyche amborsia, the nectar
of the gods, making her immortal.

00:04:55.467 --> 00:04:58.958
Shortly after, Psyche bore their daughter.

00:04:58.958 --> 00:05:01.249
They named her Pleasure,

00:05:01.249 --> 00:05:06.199
and she, Cupid, and Psyche, 
whose name means soul,

00:05:06.199 --> 00:05:10.249
have been complicating people's
love lives ever since.
