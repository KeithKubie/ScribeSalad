MALE SPEAKER: We are
glad to have here

00:00:04.090 --> 00:00:05.500
Professor N. T. Wright.

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:09.240
He is the former bishop of
Durham, which, if I am correct,

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:13.440
that makes you the House
of Lords, currently,

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:18.900
but most well known for being a
Biblical scholar and the author

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:20.490
of numerous texts.

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:22.250
I believe it's 50
different books

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:24.880
you have [INAUDIBLE] all on
New Testament scholarship

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:26.760
and religious studies.

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:28.930
So I won't exhaust this.

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:32.090
He is, for many, does
not need an introduction,

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:34.860
so yes, we're excited
to have you here.

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:36.355
So welcome, Professor Wright.

00:00:36.355 --> 00:00:37.285
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:37.285 --> 00:00:38.725
N. T. WRIGHT: Thank
you very much.

00:00:38.725 --> 00:00:39.225
Thank you.

00:00:44.407 --> 00:00:45.240
Thank you very much.

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:48.279
It's a surprise and
a delight to be here.

00:00:48.279 --> 00:00:50.570
Google for me is something
that comes up on the screen,

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:52.550
and actually thinking
of it as a place, never

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:54.380
mind a campus,
never mind people,

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:56.040
is kind of blowing
my mind right now,

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:57.810
and I'm very happy about that.

00:00:57.810 --> 00:01:00.460
I'm also happy about the fact
that whereas in my previous job

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:02.270
when I was Bishop
of Durham, almost

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:05.170
every church meeting I
went to, I significantly

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:07.860
reduced the average
age of those present,

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:10.810
I think now I'm
significantly increasing

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:11.960
the average age of those.

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:14.430
I suspect I'm at least
twice as old as most of you

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:16.472
here in this room, and
I'm very happy about that.

00:01:16.472 --> 00:01:18.429
It reminds me that I'm
on my way to retirement,

00:01:18.429 --> 00:01:20.730
and listening to music, and
playing on the golf course,

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:21.295
and so on.

00:01:21.295 --> 00:01:23.170
But at the moment, I'm
still bouncing around,

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:25.503
talking about God, and Jesus,
and the Bible, and church,

00:01:25.503 --> 00:01:28.670
and the world, and
culture, and what we

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:30.030
should be doing in our culture.

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:32.040
And since you people are
part of the people who

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:35.340
are shaping the way that
people-- not only what people

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.950
think about, but the
way people think,

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:40.640
what I want to try to
do today is to put out

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:43.580
some parameters to
do with how I think

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:46.680
the gospel, the Christian
good news, actually works,

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:48.840
and then to reflect
just a little

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:52.930
on what being human within
that good news might look like

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:57.650
and what, as humans, we ought
to be doing in order to engage

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:00.770
with the wider world in a way
which is wise, and honest,

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:02.390
and actually deeply Christian.

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:05.390
The idea of Christians
engaging with the world at all

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:07.270
has often been at a discount.

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:09.810
People think, well, I don't
really belong in this world.

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:11.130
I have a spiritual identity.

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:12.600
I'm off someplace else.

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:15.980
And actually, that is deeply
un-Biblical, deeply untrue

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:18.000
to the Jewish and
Christian vision.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:19.850
I'll explain in a moment.

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:22.370
But let me say one or two
things about good news.

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:24.920
I have a book coming out,
which has just come out,

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:27.400
called "Simply Good News."

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:30.320
I'm not sure it's actually as
simple as some people think,

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:31.990
but I'm trying to
make it simple.

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:33.830
But the main
message of that book

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:36.780
is that contrary to
popular imagination,

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:40.550
the Christian message is
good news, not good advice,

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:42.290
and there is all
sorts of difference

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:45.230
between news and advice.

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:47.950
And news is a funny
sort of thing.

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:49.890
Many people think
you go to church

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:52.360
in order to get good
advice about how to live.

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:53.800
Well, maybe you
do, but that's not

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:57.060
the main point-- or good
advice about how to reorder

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:58.520
your private spirituality.

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:01.130
Well, that, again, may
happen, but that's not

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:03.930
the whole point of it--
or even good advice

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:07.580
about which technique to
be sure you plug into so

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:10.540
that after your death, you
go to the right destination.

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:12.810
Well, again, that
seems pretty important,

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:16.070
but that sounds like
advice rather than news.

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:18.840
News is about
something that happens,

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:23.520
as a result of which the world
is a different place, often

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:26.830
in ways that people don't
expect, sometimes in ways

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:28.700
that they don't want.

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:32.260
You all know where you were
on September the 11th, 2001.

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:35.230
I bet you don't know where
you were on November the 22nd,

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:37.040
2003.

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:40.450
I know exactly where I. I was
in a hotel room in Atlanta,

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:43.520
Georgia, and I phoned home
at 5:00 in the morning

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:45.390
because the television
screens were not

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:47.510
showing the event
that I wanted to see,

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:50.120
which was the final
of the Rugby World Cup

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:53.480
because England were playing
Australia in Australia,

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:55.210
and nothing Australians
like more than

00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:57.820
to beat the British at
one of their sports.

00:03:57.820 --> 00:04:00.610
So I was naturally-- England
had made it to the final,

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:03.580
astonishingly, so I was
on pins to find out.

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:06.960
And I knew my daughter would
be glued to the television,

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:08.940
so I phoned her at
the appointed hour.

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:09.990
Oh, Dad, it's terrible.

00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:12.204
It's gone to full time,
and the score is 17-all,

00:04:12.204 --> 00:04:13.870
and they have to play
another half-hour,

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:17.399
and it's all very tense,
and-- so I got up,

00:04:17.399 --> 00:04:19.953
and I paced around, and I
waited for half an hour,

00:04:19.953 --> 00:04:22.350
and I phoned her
again, and hey, yay, we

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:24.250
won on the last
kick of the match.

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:27.100
Jonny Wilkinson, who was the
poster boy of English rugby,

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:28.320
had done a drop goal.

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:29.920
And as a result,
England had won,

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:33.240
and Australia were decimated.

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:35.590
And then I had a dilemma.

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:40.860
I was in a semi-dark hall in
a hotel in Atlanta, Georgia,

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:43.570
and I wanted to go up and
hug the hall porter and say

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:45.070
did you hear we
won the World Cup?

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:47.471
And I went, he probably
doesn't know what rugby is.

00:04:47.471 --> 00:04:48.970
He may not even
know where Australia

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:51.400
is, let alone anything else.

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:55.500
So I wanted to tell the check-in
clerks, did you hear the news?

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:59.209
And I realized this means
nothing to them whatever,

00:04:59.209 --> 00:05:01.250
and I was waiting for
somebody to come downstairs

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:04.860
to the conference who knew that
there had been a game going on.

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:07.870
And finally, somebody did,
and it was an Australian.

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:12.390
So I had this good
news, which was

00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:15.180
foolishness to the Americans,
scandalous to the Australians,

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:19.400
but for those of us who
believed, it made us happy

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:19.900
all year.

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:23.850
And one of the effects
was hundreds, thousands

00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:25.830
of little English
boys, and at least

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:28.270
hundreds of little
English girls,

00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:29.940
wanted to be Jonny
Wilkinson when

00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:32.430
they grew up and
would be practicing

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:35.210
drop goals in the schoolyard.

00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:39.094
Something had happened,
as a result of which,

00:05:39.094 --> 00:05:40.260
everything looked different.

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:42.490
Now, of course, in
sport, that doesn't last.

00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:45.036
We haven't been to-- one
of my Australian friends

00:05:45.036 --> 00:05:46.410
who read this book
and saw that I

00:05:46.410 --> 00:05:49.817
used that story upfront sent me
a rude email saying you wait.

00:05:49.817 --> 00:05:51.900
You won't be using too
many more of those stories.

00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:53.940
We'll get you.

00:05:53.940 --> 00:05:55.570
I did actually send--
when it happened,

00:05:55.570 --> 00:05:57.990
I sent him an email
congratulating the Australians

00:05:57.990 --> 00:06:00.370
on being such good
losers, and he sent one

00:06:00.370 --> 00:06:03.310
straight back saying, yeah,
considering how little practice

00:06:03.310 --> 00:06:06.260
we have at it-- at
losing, that is.

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:08.170
But you see, news
is about something

00:06:08.170 --> 00:06:10.880
that's happened, as a
result of which the world is

00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:13.750
a different place, and
as a result of which

00:06:13.750 --> 00:06:15.370
things kind of fracture.

00:06:15.370 --> 00:06:19.080
Some people say this doesn't
make any sense in our world.

00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:21.540
Other people say this
makes all the wrong kind

00:06:21.540 --> 00:06:22.840
of sense in my world.

00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:26.950
But some people find that
it transforms their lives.

00:06:26.950 --> 00:06:29.320
And in the early Christian
world, that's what happened.

00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:31.450
How did it transform
their lives?

00:06:31.450 --> 00:06:33.090
What was going on?

00:06:33.090 --> 00:06:38.090
Well, the gospel, the good
news, is a message about Jesus,

00:06:38.090 --> 00:06:40.540
but so many people
have put that message

00:06:40.540 --> 00:06:44.020
within an implicit
back story, which

00:06:44.020 --> 00:06:47.220
makes it different from how
the early Christians saw it.

00:06:47.220 --> 00:06:49.060
You see, my back
story was that I'd

00:06:49.060 --> 00:06:51.450
been following English
rugby since the days when,

00:06:51.450 --> 00:06:53.982
believe it or not, I played
rugby myself as a teenager.

00:06:53.982 --> 00:06:56.440
I've been interested in what
they're doing, following them.

00:06:56.440 --> 00:06:57.930
I knew the back story.

00:06:57.930 --> 00:06:59.980
The Australians knew
their back story,

00:06:59.980 --> 00:07:01.470
and those two were
going to clash.

00:07:01.470 --> 00:07:04.710
The Americans in Atlanta
had no back story at all,

00:07:04.710 --> 00:07:06.570
no interest--
didn't mean a thing.

00:07:06.570 --> 00:07:08.900
I might as well go out on
the street in St. Andrews

00:07:08.900 --> 00:07:11.460
and say that, I don't know,
Duke have beaten Caltech

00:07:11.460 --> 00:07:13.040
at basketball or something.

00:07:13.040 --> 00:07:15.860
People just aren't terribly
interested in [INAUDIBLE].

00:07:15.860 --> 00:07:17.010
I'm sorry about that.

00:07:19.840 --> 00:07:21.440
What's the back story?

00:07:21.440 --> 00:07:25.350
The back story for so many
people, both inside the church

00:07:25.350 --> 00:07:28.730
and outside, goes
like this, that there

00:07:28.730 --> 00:07:31.966
is this dangerous God
somewhere up in the sky, maybe.

00:07:31.966 --> 00:07:32.590
We're not sure.

00:07:32.590 --> 00:07:35.010
But if there is, he's dangerous.

00:07:35.010 --> 00:07:37.490
He's made a very
high moral bar, which

00:07:37.490 --> 00:07:40.200
he wants us all to jump over.

00:07:40.200 --> 00:07:42.460
We've all failed to jump
over that moral bar,

00:07:42.460 --> 00:07:44.410
so he's out to get us.

00:07:44.410 --> 00:07:46.220
But then, at the last
minute, fortunately,

00:07:46.220 --> 00:07:50.351
somebody else steps in the
way, takes a hit in our place.

00:07:50.351 --> 00:07:51.350
Phew, so it's all right.

00:07:51.350 --> 00:07:53.200
And it happens to
be his own son.

00:07:53.200 --> 00:07:55.010
So somehow, that's OK.

00:07:55.010 --> 00:07:57.560
Now, I have not yet
found a preacher who

00:07:57.560 --> 00:08:00.420
admits to having preached
the gospel like that,

00:08:00.420 --> 00:08:04.130
but I know many, many people
in many, many churches

00:08:04.130 --> 00:08:06.810
for whom that is what
they've actually heard.

00:08:06.810 --> 00:08:12.440
That's what they think more
or less the message is about.

00:08:12.440 --> 00:08:15.360
The back story, actually,
is very different to that.

00:08:15.360 --> 00:08:17.710
The back story is
about a good world,

00:08:17.710 --> 00:08:20.810
a good God who made
a good world and who

00:08:20.810 --> 00:08:24.870
made human beings to be
within his good world

00:08:24.870 --> 00:08:28.120
as people who would
bring wisdom, and order,

00:08:28.120 --> 00:08:31.500
and flourishing, and
possibility to that world

00:08:31.500 --> 00:08:33.330
to develop his creation.

00:08:33.330 --> 00:08:35.870
He says be fruitful and multiply
and look after the world.

00:08:35.870 --> 00:08:37.659
Name the animals.

00:08:37.659 --> 00:08:40.900
Tend the garden.

00:08:40.900 --> 00:08:44.110
And who would sum up the
praises of the world,

00:08:44.110 --> 00:08:46.680
the praises of the trees,
and the season, the animals,

00:08:46.680 --> 00:08:49.960
and so on, and present them in
articulate speech before God.

00:08:49.960 --> 00:08:52.850
This is the vocation
of being human,

00:08:52.850 --> 00:08:55.780
and that vocation remains--
come back to that in a moment.

00:08:55.780 --> 00:09:00.500
But when humans mess up and say,
no, we don't want to do that.

00:09:00.500 --> 00:09:02.029
We've got our own
way of doing this,

00:09:02.029 --> 00:09:04.320
and we're going to manipulate
the world in our own way,

00:09:04.320 --> 00:09:05.153
thank you very much.

00:09:05.153 --> 00:09:08.690
And, well, God, if there is a
God, you can do your own thing.

00:09:08.690 --> 00:09:12.210
The results of that is not that
you have a big, bad, angry God

00:09:12.210 --> 00:09:14.830
with a big stick about
to beat us over the head,

00:09:14.830 --> 00:09:18.890
but that the project for
the creation as a whole

00:09:18.890 --> 00:09:20.930
is out of joint.

00:09:20.930 --> 00:09:24.420
You see that in 100, maybe
1,000 different ways,

00:09:24.420 --> 00:09:27.330
both in the Bible and,
of course, in our world.

00:09:27.330 --> 00:09:29.800
Now, there are many, many
mysteries about this.

00:09:29.800 --> 00:09:32.400
I'm not saying that
human rebellion

00:09:32.400 --> 00:09:34.170
causes, say, earthquakes.

00:09:34.170 --> 00:09:38.910
A tectonic plate does what a
tectonic plate does, and so on.

00:09:38.910 --> 00:09:41.340
However, many, many
things have gone

00:09:41.340 --> 00:09:46.480
radically wrong in the world as
a result of human brokenness.

00:09:46.480 --> 00:09:49.270
And the plan, the back
story, is about God

00:09:49.270 --> 00:09:52.670
dealing with the human
brokenness in order

00:09:52.670 --> 00:09:54.250
to put the world right.

00:09:54.250 --> 00:09:59.360
In other words, God the
creator promises and intends

00:09:59.360 --> 00:10:01.720
to put the world
right, and so He

00:10:01.720 --> 00:10:05.420
puts us right in
the present in order

00:10:05.420 --> 00:10:08.860
that we can be part of
his putting-right project

00:10:08.860 --> 00:10:09.920
for the world.

00:10:09.920 --> 00:10:11.830
That's how the story works.

00:10:11.830 --> 00:10:13.650
And within that,
you get, if you're

00:10:13.650 --> 00:10:15.880
a traditional Christian
with theories of atonement,

00:10:15.880 --> 00:10:18.370
incarnation,
resurrection, et cetera,

00:10:18.370 --> 00:10:20.270
et cetera, you get all of that.

00:10:20.270 --> 00:10:21.670
In fact, you get it enhanced.

00:10:21.670 --> 00:10:24.680
It makes more sense of
your traditional frameworks

00:10:24.680 --> 00:10:29.260
and texts, not less.

00:10:29.260 --> 00:10:31.810
But what this leaves
us with is a vision

00:10:31.810 --> 00:10:35.830
of a world with the
creator putting it right,

00:10:35.830 --> 00:10:39.040
doing so through Jesus,
and then promising

00:10:39.040 --> 00:10:41.870
that what He did through
Jesus-- uniquely one-off--

00:10:41.870 --> 00:10:45.880
that's the news about the
event that actually happened.

00:10:45.880 --> 00:10:49.790
What he did with Jesus,
He will do in the future

00:10:49.790 --> 00:10:51.230
for the whole creation.

00:10:51.230 --> 00:10:54.160
Hence, the death and
resurrection of Jesus

00:10:54.160 --> 00:10:57.470
point forward to the
ultimate event, which

00:10:57.470 --> 00:10:59.480
is God putting the
whole world right,

00:10:59.480 --> 00:11:03.720
and we are held in between
the one event and the other.

00:11:03.720 --> 00:11:06.230
This is where the rugby story
doesn't work quite so well.

00:11:06.230 --> 00:11:09.310
Another story which I use in
the book, and which I developed,

00:11:09.310 --> 00:11:11.190
is the ancient
historical story of what

00:11:11.190 --> 00:11:15.260
happened after Julius Caesar's
assassination in 44 BC.

00:11:15.260 --> 00:11:18.730
His heir and putative
successor, Octavian,

00:11:18.730 --> 00:11:21.020
ended up in a civil
war against Antony,

00:11:21.020 --> 00:11:23.020
who'd been one of
Caesar's best friends,

00:11:23.020 --> 00:11:25.510
because they could tell the
big prize was out there.

00:11:25.510 --> 00:11:28.220
Only one of them
would be the big dog

00:11:28.220 --> 00:11:32.000
in this great superpower that
was the early Roman Empire.

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:34.620
And finally-- and
all the Roman world

00:11:34.620 --> 00:11:36.242
was on tiptoe
waiting to see what

00:11:36.242 --> 00:11:38.200
would happen because half
of them were with one

00:11:38.200 --> 00:11:40.460
and half of them were with
the other, and half of them

00:11:40.460 --> 00:11:44.070
hated them both, and it
was all very confusing.

00:11:44.070 --> 00:11:46.920
Finally, Octavian defeated
Antony at the Battle of Actium,

00:11:46.920 --> 00:11:48.770
and Antony and Cleopatra
went back to Egypt,

00:11:48.770 --> 00:11:50.760
where they died not
long afterwards.

00:11:50.760 --> 00:11:53.060
And then, Octavian had
to go around all the bits

00:11:53.060 --> 00:11:54.920
that needed mopping
up and sorting out

00:11:54.920 --> 00:11:56.260
before coming back to Rome.

00:11:56.260 --> 00:11:57.824
But the word would
get back to Rome--

00:11:57.824 --> 00:11:59.740
and this is the point
of my telling the story.

00:11:59.740 --> 00:12:02.710
Something has happened, as a
result of which the world is

00:12:02.710 --> 00:12:04.020
a different place.

00:12:04.020 --> 00:12:05.430
Octavian has won.

00:12:05.430 --> 00:12:07.330
He's now going to be in charge.

00:12:07.330 --> 00:12:10.120
You better get your head round
that one and your allegiance

00:12:10.120 --> 00:12:11.250
sorted out.

00:12:11.250 --> 00:12:12.490
Something will happen.

00:12:12.490 --> 00:12:14.380
He's coming back
to Rome when he's

00:12:14.380 --> 00:12:16.400
sorted out all the other stuff.

00:12:16.400 --> 00:12:19.760
And anyone living in
Rome between the victory

00:12:19.760 --> 00:12:22.540
at Actium in 31 and
Octavian's return

00:12:22.540 --> 00:12:25.260
three years later
would know that they

00:12:25.260 --> 00:12:28.680
had to order their lives
in accordance with the fact

00:12:28.680 --> 00:12:31.976
that now there was a
different system obtaining.

00:12:31.976 --> 00:12:34.350
Something has happened, as a
result of which the world is

00:12:34.350 --> 00:12:35.170
a different place.

00:12:35.170 --> 00:12:37.540
Something will happen,
which will complete that,

00:12:37.540 --> 00:12:40.980
and we live in between the two.

00:12:40.980 --> 00:12:43.850
So when as a Christian I say,
well, something has happened.

00:12:43.850 --> 00:12:46.610
This is the death and
resurrection of Jesus,

00:12:46.610 --> 00:12:51.390
and the gift of this strange,
mysterious, sometimes intimate,

00:12:51.390 --> 00:12:53.210
sometimes frightening
force that we

00:12:53.210 --> 00:12:57.530
call the Holy Spirit-- the
interval between those gifts

00:12:57.530 --> 00:13:01.140
and the final putting right of
all things is where we live,

00:13:01.140 --> 00:13:05.130
and that's where the human
vocation gets restored.

00:13:05.130 --> 00:13:07.330
And the human vocation
in the New Testament

00:13:07.330 --> 00:13:10.170
will be, again, to
be image bearers.

00:13:10.170 --> 00:13:11.950
The image-- by the
way, many of you

00:13:11.950 --> 00:13:13.730
may have heard this
language about being

00:13:13.730 --> 00:13:16.180
in the image of God, and there
are all sorts of theories

00:13:16.180 --> 00:13:17.580
about what that means.

00:13:17.580 --> 00:13:19.970
Biblical scholars now are
increasingly convinced

00:13:19.970 --> 00:13:22.640
that what it means is
that humans are designed

00:13:22.640 --> 00:13:27.040
to be a kind of angled
mirror so that you reflect

00:13:27.040 --> 00:13:30.790
God out into the world--
think of the angled mirror--

00:13:30.790 --> 00:13:33.980
and you reflect the
world back to God.

00:13:33.980 --> 00:13:36.775
And when humans go wrong, it's
when they turn the mirror so

00:13:36.775 --> 00:13:39.140
that it reflects the
world back to the world,

00:13:39.140 --> 00:13:41.530
and then you go around
in a fairly deadly cycle

00:13:41.530 --> 00:13:44.560
because the world does
not have life in itself.

00:13:44.560 --> 00:13:46.200
It's a God-given life.

00:13:46.200 --> 00:13:50.530
So the human task is
to bring God's wisdom

00:13:50.530 --> 00:13:53.620
and flourishing to
the world to make

00:13:53.620 --> 00:13:57.340
the-- there's an old joke in my
country about a clergyman who's

00:13:57.340 --> 00:13:58.850
walking down the
street, and he sees

00:13:58.850 --> 00:14:00.320
somebody digging the garden.

00:14:00.320 --> 00:14:02.000
And he says, isn't
it wonderful what

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:05.170
can happen when providence and
the hand of man get together

00:14:05.170 --> 00:14:06.250
and work on something?

00:14:06.250 --> 00:14:08.541
And the gardener says, you
should have seen this garden

00:14:08.541 --> 00:14:11.470
when providence had it
all to itself, because

00:14:11.470 --> 00:14:14.010
of course, what's sad
about-- and actually, it's

00:14:14.010 --> 00:14:14.706
a silly joke.

00:14:14.706 --> 00:14:16.580
It's a well-known joke,
but it's a silly joke

00:14:16.580 --> 00:14:19.780
because in a Christian or
Jewish doctrine of providence,

00:14:19.780 --> 00:14:22.970
the way God wanted to work
in the world, large scale

00:14:22.970 --> 00:14:27.950
and small scale, is in so many
cases through human beings.

00:14:27.950 --> 00:14:30.010
Of course, you and I
didn't make the sunrise

00:14:30.010 --> 00:14:32.490
or the moonrise last
night or this morning.

00:14:32.490 --> 00:14:35.040
You and I don't do an awful lot
of things which nevertheless

00:14:35.040 --> 00:14:36.010
happen in the world.

00:14:36.010 --> 00:14:39.540
But the way God wants
this world to flourish

00:14:39.540 --> 00:14:43.290
is by wise human beings
taking responsibility,

00:14:43.290 --> 00:14:46.250
doing things which will
bring that flourishing

00:14:46.250 --> 00:14:48.840
to the world, which is
where you guys come in

00:14:48.840 --> 00:14:51.830
because of course, the
world needs information.

00:14:51.830 --> 00:14:52.370
Thank you.

00:14:52.370 --> 00:14:54.750
We get much more
of it as a result

00:14:54.750 --> 00:14:56.430
of what you do,
actually much more

00:14:56.430 --> 00:14:57.800
than we can possibly cope with.

00:14:57.800 --> 00:15:00.030
It's like drinking
from a fire hydrant.

00:15:00.030 --> 00:15:02.320
And whereas when I
was a young scholar,

00:15:02.320 --> 00:15:03.820
I would trudge off
to the library,

00:15:03.820 --> 00:15:05.750
and I would get a
heavy, dusty volume out,

00:15:05.750 --> 00:15:08.469
and I would look up something
and take half the morning

00:15:08.469 --> 00:15:10.760
and then go and have a cup
of coffee to think about it,

00:15:10.760 --> 00:15:14.270
I now just go brrmph, and
there it is on the screen,

00:15:14.270 --> 00:15:17.770
although, of course, sometimes
I get conflicting information,

00:15:17.770 --> 00:15:20.140
even from you guys,
so that's something

00:15:20.140 --> 00:15:21.400
one has to be careful about.

00:15:21.400 --> 00:15:24.470
But information
generally, obviously,

00:15:24.470 --> 00:15:26.700
is a very, very,
very good thing.

00:15:26.700 --> 00:15:30.700
And information-- the gathering,
collecting, and disseminating

00:15:30.700 --> 00:15:32.700
of information
seems to me always

00:15:32.700 --> 00:15:35.910
has been actually a vital
part of the human task.

00:15:35.910 --> 00:15:38.100
That's why education
is something

00:15:38.100 --> 00:15:40.950
which the Jewish and Christian
traditions have always

00:15:40.950 --> 00:15:44.480
insisted on as being paramount,
not just for the elite,

00:15:44.480 --> 00:15:48.220
but for everyone within reach,
that actually giving people

00:15:48.220 --> 00:15:52.040
the information about the world,
about themselves, about life

00:15:52.040 --> 00:15:53.370
is enabling.

00:15:53.370 --> 00:15:55.750
It's part of human flourishing.

00:15:55.750 --> 00:15:57.300
And suddenly,
something's happened

00:15:57.300 --> 00:16:00.220
in this last generation as
a result of everything here

00:16:00.220 --> 00:16:02.900
and in this surrounding
area, as a result of which,

00:16:02.900 --> 00:16:05.920
the world as a whole
is far better informed

00:16:05.920 --> 00:16:07.972
than it's ever been.

00:16:07.972 --> 00:16:10.180
I suppose the question that
I have about that-- well,

00:16:10.180 --> 00:16:12.570
I have many questions
about it, one of which is,

00:16:12.570 --> 00:16:16.120
what changes when, instead
of walking to the library,

00:16:16.120 --> 00:16:18.740
thinking about something,
looking it up, going and having

00:16:18.740 --> 00:16:20.840
a coffee and thinking
about, then going back

00:16:20.840 --> 00:16:24.360
to work-- instead of that, it
takes me three seconds to find

00:16:24.360 --> 00:16:26.460
it through Google or whatever.

00:16:26.460 --> 00:16:29.360
Something's changed about
the way we do research,

00:16:29.360 --> 00:16:31.520
and I'm not sure that
any of us have really

00:16:31.520 --> 00:16:33.660
come to terms with that yet.

00:16:33.660 --> 00:16:36.680
Whether we have the time
to reflect that we used to,

00:16:36.680 --> 00:16:39.367
or whether this just does
create more time to reflect

00:16:39.367 --> 00:16:41.700
because there's less walking
around and sitting drinking

00:16:41.700 --> 00:16:43.100
coffee, whatever-- well, maybe.

00:16:43.100 --> 00:16:46.370
We still walk around
and drink coffee.

00:16:46.370 --> 00:16:48.820
But in the middle of that,
there's a difference--

00:16:48.820 --> 00:16:50.490
obviously, as you
know as well as I do,

00:16:50.490 --> 00:16:54.620
but I want to draw it out--
between information and wisdom.

00:16:54.620 --> 00:16:56.910
And what we find in the
Bible very interestingly

00:16:56.910 --> 00:16:59.060
is this famous character
called Solomon,

00:16:59.060 --> 00:17:01.690
one of the early
great kings of Israel.

00:17:01.690 --> 00:17:03.990
Well, he had problems
at a certain point,

00:17:03.990 --> 00:17:06.760
but basically, a really
extraordinary human being

00:17:06.760 --> 00:17:07.790
in the tradition.

00:17:07.790 --> 00:17:10.359
And Solomon, we
are told, collected

00:17:10.359 --> 00:17:13.510
information like nobody
had ever done before.

00:17:13.510 --> 00:17:16.500
He knew all about the trees,
and the flowers, and the birds,

00:17:16.500 --> 00:17:17.349
and the animals.

00:17:17.349 --> 00:17:19.190
He knew all about
what we would call

00:17:19.190 --> 00:17:22.380
the encyclopedia of
information known to humans,

00:17:22.380 --> 00:17:23.589
and he collected this.

00:17:23.589 --> 00:17:26.690
He had folk who went out
and gathered information.

00:17:26.690 --> 00:17:29.840
All sorts of stuff he knew,
and he could teach it,

00:17:29.840 --> 00:17:31.670
and he could inform people.

00:17:31.670 --> 00:17:34.940
But interestingly, none of
that stuff is in the Bible.

00:17:34.940 --> 00:17:38.000
I would love to have Solomon's
lists of trees and animals.

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:39.060
That would be brilliant.

00:17:39.060 --> 00:17:40.010
But we don't.

00:17:40.010 --> 00:17:43.370
What we have instead is a book
called Proverbs, some of which

00:17:43.370 --> 00:17:46.370
may go back to Solomon, but
it's the Solomonic tradition.

00:17:46.370 --> 00:17:50.070
And Proverbs has a certain
amount of information,

00:17:50.070 --> 00:17:54.690
but it's actually-- how do you
steer through this minefield

00:17:54.690 --> 00:17:55.610
of information?

00:17:55.610 --> 00:17:58.600
How do you navigate
a wise course?

00:17:58.600 --> 00:18:01.160
How do you know which to choose?

00:18:01.160 --> 00:18:03.100
When all this
information is out there,

00:18:03.100 --> 00:18:07.770
how do you know what you should
do now in this human situation?

00:18:07.770 --> 00:18:11.450
And of course, if I Google
for advice on something,

00:18:11.450 --> 00:18:13.710
I'm sure there'll be all
sorts of websites that'll

00:18:13.710 --> 00:18:16.030
come up telling me exactly
how to do everything

00:18:16.030 --> 00:18:19.594
from planting a tree to fixing
a card to whatever it may be I

00:18:19.594 --> 00:18:20.760
want to do-- cooking a meal.

00:18:20.760 --> 00:18:23.480
I'm told there are now people
whose entire repertoire

00:18:23.480 --> 00:18:26.910
of cookery is what they find
online, recipes and so on.

00:18:26.910 --> 00:18:28.150
Fortunately, I'm not a cook.

00:18:28.150 --> 00:18:30.010
I say fortunately for
the sake of my family

00:18:30.010 --> 00:18:34.210
so that I don't do that, but
I can see how useful that is.

00:18:34.210 --> 00:18:36.030
But the point is that
the book of Proverbs

00:18:36.030 --> 00:18:39.170
and the whole wisdom
tradition, which comes through

00:18:39.170 --> 00:18:41.340
into the New
Testament and beyond,

00:18:41.340 --> 00:18:43.720
is not simply about information.

00:18:43.720 --> 00:18:46.600
It's about wisdom,
and at the heart of it

00:18:46.600 --> 00:18:49.980
is that rather strange
old line which says,

00:18:49.980 --> 00:18:53.050
"The fear of the Lord is
the beginning of wisdom."

00:18:53.050 --> 00:18:54.670
And I need to say
quickly in brackets

00:18:54.670 --> 00:18:58.950
that the word "fear" doesn't
mean a panicky, cringing fear.

00:18:58.950 --> 00:19:00.250
It means reverence.

00:19:00.250 --> 00:19:04.630
It means recognizing that God
is God and that I'm not God.

00:19:04.630 --> 00:19:07.170
And it seems to be the
danger with so many aspects

00:19:07.170 --> 00:19:09.950
of our culture-- and this
isn't a cheap shot at you

00:19:09.950 --> 00:19:12.540
and what you do because
actually, it affects all of us

00:19:12.540 --> 00:19:15.580
in one sort or another-- is
that we think by gathering

00:19:15.580 --> 00:19:17.550
information, we're in charge.

00:19:17.550 --> 00:19:19.420
We are controlling this.

00:19:19.420 --> 00:19:22.280
The equivalent I see in
my culture, interestingly,

00:19:22.280 --> 00:19:25.180
over the 1990s and then
on into the early years

00:19:25.180 --> 00:19:27.780
of the present century
is that whenever

00:19:27.780 --> 00:19:30.070
there was a problem in
my society, at least,

00:19:30.070 --> 00:19:32.380
and I think this
happened in America too,

00:19:32.380 --> 00:19:34.880
somebody in government
and in the civil service

00:19:34.880 --> 00:19:38.560
thought it was a good idea to
get us to fill in forms, often

00:19:38.560 --> 00:19:42.040
in triplicate, and to sign
off on them so that everything

00:19:42.040 --> 00:19:46.560
you did had a paper trail which
ended up in somebody's office

00:19:46.560 --> 00:19:47.840
files somewhere.

00:19:47.840 --> 00:19:49.850
And we all used to
grumble and say,

00:19:49.850 --> 00:19:52.100
are we going to be given
extra secretaries to do this?

00:19:52.100 --> 00:19:53.808
And the answer was
no, can't afford that.

00:19:53.808 --> 00:19:56.250
So everyone's
workload just secretly

00:19:56.250 --> 00:19:58.320
expands into more
and more paperwork,

00:19:58.320 --> 00:20:01.140
as though by the
gathering of information,

00:20:01.140 --> 00:20:03.770
we will make sure that we're
all behaving properly and doing

00:20:03.770 --> 00:20:04.720
things right.

00:20:04.720 --> 00:20:06.890
And I have to tell you, I
don't think our behavior

00:20:06.890 --> 00:20:08.000
has changed at all.

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:11.200
We just have a lot of very
bulging filing cabinets

00:20:11.200 --> 00:20:13.350
because the collection
of information

00:20:13.350 --> 00:20:15.800
does not necessarily
produce wisdom,

00:20:15.800 --> 00:20:17.390
but the collection
of information

00:20:17.390 --> 00:20:21.340
can give you the illusion that
actually, you can play God.

00:20:21.340 --> 00:20:25.150
Now that you've got all this
information, you're in charge.

00:20:25.150 --> 00:20:27.460
And of course, if
you've got information,

00:20:27.460 --> 00:20:28.680
that does give you power.

00:20:28.680 --> 00:20:31.290
It gives you a lot
of power over anyone

00:20:31.290 --> 00:20:32.840
who doesn't have information.

00:20:32.840 --> 00:20:35.740
But the real secret
is, how do you

00:20:35.740 --> 00:20:40.300
select, arrange the information,
and how do you do so wisely?

00:20:40.300 --> 00:20:43.670
In the New Testament,
that whole idea of wisdom,

00:20:43.670 --> 00:20:46.860
like so many other things
in the Old Testament,

00:20:46.860 --> 00:20:51.180
comes forward and emerges,
not just as an abstract ideal,

00:20:51.180 --> 00:20:54.840
but as a person, because one
of the big categories that

00:20:54.840 --> 00:20:57.270
swirls around in
the New Testament

00:20:57.270 --> 00:21:01.600
is the idea that Jesus himself
is the embodiment of wisdom.

00:21:01.600 --> 00:21:04.590
Saint Paul says,
"In him are hidden

00:21:04.590 --> 00:21:08.690
all the treasures of wisdom
and knowledge," which is like--

00:21:08.690 --> 00:21:09.630
how does that work?

00:21:09.630 --> 00:21:10.690
How does that cash out?

00:21:10.690 --> 00:21:12.590
Well, it doesn't
mean that if you

00:21:12.590 --> 00:21:14.320
know Jesus, that if
you're a Christian,

00:21:14.320 --> 00:21:17.090
you will suddenly become
a walking encyclopedia.

00:21:17.090 --> 00:21:20.190
It does mean, however, that if
you get to know Jesus and let

00:21:20.190 --> 00:21:24.110
him reshape your life, then
there is at least a chance that

00:21:24.110 --> 00:21:26.210
in some ways at
least to begin with,

00:21:26.210 --> 00:21:28.130
and hopefully more
as you go on, you

00:21:28.130 --> 00:21:32.070
will be making wise
choices about what

00:21:32.070 --> 00:21:35.760
from that world of information
to harvest, to deploy,

00:21:35.760 --> 00:21:38.250
to do things with,
and in particular,

00:21:38.250 --> 00:21:40.620
how to use the
information wisely

00:21:40.620 --> 00:21:43.329
for the benefit of
the whole world,

00:21:43.329 --> 00:21:44.620
because that's the other thing.

00:21:44.620 --> 00:21:46.161
If you're just
gathering information,

00:21:46.161 --> 00:21:48.540
it can be so that you
can simply do whatever

00:21:48.540 --> 00:21:51.940
you want to do and let the rest
of the world be as ill-informed

00:21:51.940 --> 00:21:52.840
as it wants.

00:21:52.840 --> 00:21:55.980
But the whole point of wisdom
in the Biblical tradition

00:21:55.980 --> 00:22:00.270
is about new creation,
that through wisdom, God

00:22:00.270 --> 00:22:04.790
wants to work through wise human
beings in every walk of life

00:22:04.790 --> 00:22:08.540
in order to bring
about healing, repair,

00:22:08.540 --> 00:22:13.780
flourishing, wise human
societies, wise ecologies,

00:22:13.780 --> 00:22:17.480
wise ways of being
in the creation.

00:22:17.480 --> 00:22:20.280
So the vision of good news,
of what happened in Jesus

00:22:20.280 --> 00:22:23.740
and what will happen at the
end, catches us in between it.

00:22:23.740 --> 00:22:26.850
When Jesus came out of the
tomb on Easter morning,

00:22:26.850 --> 00:22:30.000
that was the beginning
of new creation.

00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:32.837
So many Christians think, well,
he rose again three days later.

00:22:32.837 --> 00:22:34.670
That's fine, so there
is a life after death,

00:22:34.670 --> 00:22:35.860
so we're going to heaven.

00:22:35.860 --> 00:22:37.510
That's not the point.

00:22:37.510 --> 00:22:40.890
The point is that when
Jesus rose on the third day,

00:22:40.890 --> 00:22:44.240
this was the launch
of the new creation,

00:22:44.240 --> 00:22:47.880
with Jesus himself
as its first example

00:22:47.880 --> 00:22:52.540
and as its active agent,
and God will do finally

00:22:52.540 --> 00:22:56.280
for the whole creation what
happened then at Easter

00:22:56.280 --> 00:22:58.020
with Jesus' resurrection.

00:22:58.020 --> 00:23:00.210
That's the Christian
good news, and I've

00:23:00.210 --> 00:23:02.890
suggested that as
we think about what

00:23:02.890 --> 00:23:07.320
it means to be genuinely human
within that vision, what we

00:23:07.320 --> 00:23:09.670
find is a vision
of Jesus himself

00:23:09.670 --> 00:23:12.370
as the embodiment
of wisdom giving us

00:23:12.370 --> 00:23:15.700
the human vocation, the
Solomonic vocation, if you

00:23:15.700 --> 00:23:18.750
like-- yes, to have as
much information as we can.

00:23:18.750 --> 00:23:20.650
That's wonderful--
but then, also

00:23:20.650 --> 00:23:25.610
to know how to use,
deploy, navigate it wisely

00:23:25.610 --> 00:23:29.110
for the benefit not just
of ourselves, but of God's

00:23:29.110 --> 00:23:31.820
whole creation, of
his whole world.

00:23:31.820 --> 00:23:34.380
Now, I've probably said enough
to start a few hairs running.

00:23:34.380 --> 00:23:35.880
My watch says it's
nearly half-past,

00:23:35.880 --> 00:23:38.480
so we've got about half an
hour before I think some of you

00:23:38.480 --> 00:23:39.740
have to disperse.

00:23:39.740 --> 00:23:42.450
So what I normally do
at this point, which

00:23:42.450 --> 00:23:45.220
might be a good idea, is just
to take a minute and everyone

00:23:45.220 --> 00:23:47.690
turn to their neighbor
and buzz and say

00:23:47.690 --> 00:23:50.220
what you found puzzling,
or exciting, or dangerous,

00:23:50.220 --> 00:23:52.130
or heretical, or
whatever it may be.

00:23:52.130 --> 00:23:54.260
Before I do that,
one other thing,

00:23:54.260 --> 00:23:56.920
because if I didn't say this,
I have a colleague who would be

00:23:56.920 --> 00:23:58.660
cross with me for not saying it.

00:23:58.660 --> 00:24:01.800
I am working in partnership
with the Wisconsin Center

00:24:01.800 --> 00:24:04.140
for Christian Studies,
and they have set up

00:24:04.140 --> 00:24:08.599
some mass online courses
with me as the speaker, they

00:24:08.599 --> 00:24:10.890
they're doing all the actual
work, preparing the course

00:24:10.890 --> 00:24:12.730
materials and all of that.

00:24:12.730 --> 00:24:14.800
And if you are interested
in following this up,

00:24:14.800 --> 00:24:17.390
the first one is now out on
the "Letter to the Galatians."

00:24:17.390 --> 00:24:20.100
And then there are a couple
of others coming, one of which

00:24:20.100 --> 00:24:22.131
is based on "Simply Good News."

00:24:22.131 --> 00:24:23.630
And then, God
willing, there will be

00:24:23.630 --> 00:24:25.560
more in the months that follow.

00:24:25.560 --> 00:24:32.870
And the key for this
is www.ntwright.org.

00:24:32.870 --> 00:24:35.500
So you all know about
mass online courses

00:24:35.500 --> 00:24:36.700
and how all that works.

00:24:36.700 --> 00:24:38.783
I don't actually know
anything about how it works.

00:24:38.783 --> 00:24:41.160
All I do is sit in my room
at home and talk to a camera,

00:24:41.160 --> 00:24:42.580
and then somebody
else does the work.

00:24:42.580 --> 00:24:44.996
But I told him that I would
tell you, so I've now done it.

00:24:44.996 --> 00:24:45.720
There it is.

00:24:45.720 --> 00:24:47.640
So now, turn to your
neighbor and buzz

00:24:47.640 --> 00:24:49.450
about what you just
heard, and then we'll

00:24:49.450 --> 00:24:51.950
take some questions
in just one minute.

00:24:51.950 --> 00:24:52.974
AUDIENCE: Hey.

00:24:52.974 --> 00:24:54.890
I would like to ask your
opinion on something.

00:24:54.890 --> 00:24:56.350
So in the beginning
of your talk,

00:24:56.350 --> 00:25:00.340
you were saying that
humans act through God,

00:25:00.340 --> 00:25:02.630
or Got acts through them
to create a good world,

00:25:02.630 --> 00:25:05.230
and sometimes they
get rebellious,

00:25:05.230 --> 00:25:07.210
and we mess things up.

00:25:07.210 --> 00:25:08.970
So do you think that
in history, there

00:25:08.970 --> 00:25:11.980
have been occasions where
when humans get rebellious

00:25:11.980 --> 00:25:15.980
or when they challenge a
status quo that it actually

00:25:15.980 --> 00:25:17.720
led to a good thing?

00:25:17.720 --> 00:25:19.840
I just moved here
recently from Ireland,

00:25:19.840 --> 00:25:21.910
and Ireland, as
you probably know,

00:25:21.910 --> 00:25:25.660
had a referendum last
week on same-sex marriage.

00:25:25.660 --> 00:25:27.994
So some people would call
that quite rebellious.

00:25:27.994 --> 00:25:30.660
It challenges a lot of things in
the Bible, so I was wondering--

00:25:30.660 --> 00:25:31.380
N. T. WRIGHT: Oh, OK.

00:25:31.380 --> 00:25:33.671
Yeah, I think we're using
rebellious in different ways.

00:25:33.671 --> 00:25:36.930
I was meaning rebelling
against God's will for humans,

00:25:36.930 --> 00:25:39.746
not rebelling against our
societies or whatever.

00:25:39.746 --> 00:25:41.620
AUDIENCE: But that's
rebelling against what's

00:25:41.620 --> 00:25:42.911
written in the Bible, isn't it?

00:25:42.911 --> 00:25:45.540
N. T. WRIGHT: Oh, well, that's
a whole other issue, which

00:25:45.540 --> 00:25:47.905
I'd be quite happy not to
get into today because that's

00:25:47.905 --> 00:25:48.405
just--

00:25:48.405 --> 00:25:49.982
[LAUGHTER]

00:25:49.982 --> 00:25:51.440
We could spend the
whole day on it,

00:25:51.440 --> 00:25:54.890
and it is one of the
buzzy issues right now.

00:25:54.890 --> 00:25:57.340
But there are
differences there as

00:25:57.340 --> 00:26:03.160
to how a civil society
organizes itself in relation

00:26:03.160 --> 00:26:04.942
to what it deems to be wise.

00:26:04.942 --> 00:26:06.400
And from a Christian
point of view,

00:26:06.400 --> 00:26:08.230
many Christian
teachers, including

00:26:08.230 --> 00:26:10.760
most of the Christian
leaders in Ireland itself,

00:26:10.760 --> 00:26:13.140
were saying actually, no,
here's the way we should go.

00:26:13.140 --> 00:26:16.730
And then, 60% of the society
of voted the other way.

00:26:16.730 --> 00:26:19.220
Now, if you live in a
modern, secular democracy,

00:26:19.220 --> 00:26:21.700
that's just likely
to happen, but that's

00:26:21.700 --> 00:26:24.720
just one of 1,000 things.

00:26:24.720 --> 00:26:28.660
For years, centuries,
governments often

00:26:28.660 --> 00:26:31.540
would be Christian
governments-- have legislated

00:26:31.540 --> 00:26:35.960
in favor of, say, slavery, or
in favor of not giving women

00:26:35.960 --> 00:26:37.330
the vote, or whatever.

00:26:37.330 --> 00:26:39.040
And yeah, I think
bad things have

00:26:39.040 --> 00:26:41.350
happened as a result of that,
but it takes a long time.

00:26:41.350 --> 00:26:43.960
That wasn't what I
meant by rebellious.

00:26:43.960 --> 00:26:46.870
Obviously, there might
be specific examples,

00:26:46.870 --> 00:26:50.184
but I meant in the much bigger,
more general sense-- yeah,

00:26:50.184 --> 00:26:52.100
it'll work out in the
particular ones as well.

00:26:52.100 --> 00:26:53.730
In the bigger,
more general sense,

00:26:53.730 --> 00:26:57.460
that there are broadly
pretty obvious ways

00:26:57.460 --> 00:26:58.880
of human flourishing.

00:26:58.880 --> 00:27:01.250
Start with the Ten
Commandments, for start,

00:27:01.250 --> 00:27:03.500
that if you don't steal
and don't commit adultery

00:27:03.500 --> 00:27:06.270
and don't murder et cetera
and honor your parents

00:27:06.270 --> 00:27:08.470
and don't tell lies,
especially on oath,

00:27:08.470 --> 00:27:12.340
then this will be a better
place to live in than if you

00:27:12.340 --> 00:27:14.050
go about doing those things.

00:27:14.050 --> 00:27:18.340
And so as I often say
to people when they say,

00:27:18.340 --> 00:27:19.920
oh, I don't like
the idea of law.

00:27:19.920 --> 00:27:22.680
It's so restrictive, as
though God has given us

00:27:22.680 --> 00:27:24.280
these laws to cramp our style.

00:27:24.280 --> 00:27:26.450
So when you're driving
down the highway,

00:27:26.450 --> 00:27:28.380
actually, it's a very
good thing that we

00:27:28.380 --> 00:27:31.080
know that-- of course, here
you all drive on the right,

00:27:31.080 --> 00:27:34.030
but at home, we drive--
at least we have this law,

00:27:34.030 --> 00:27:37.090
and unless somebody forgets,
we can now all drive

00:27:37.090 --> 00:27:39.150
at a reasonable
speed-- maybe not here,

00:27:39.150 --> 00:27:40.300
because there's so
much traffic, but you

00:27:40.300 --> 00:27:42.050
know what I mean--
because we know which--

00:27:42.050 --> 00:27:44.749
if there was no law about
which side to drive on,

00:27:44.749 --> 00:27:47.040
we wouldn't be able to drive
more than about five miles

00:27:47.040 --> 00:27:49.410
an hour because everyone
would be trying to navigate

00:27:49.410 --> 00:27:50.710
between everyone else.

00:27:50.710 --> 00:27:55.120
So when we rebel against the
broad law which God has given,

00:27:55.120 --> 00:27:58.280
as in the Ten Commandments,
et cetera, then yes,

00:27:58.280 --> 00:28:01.750
society fractures and
deconstructs, and bad things

00:28:01.750 --> 00:28:04.450
happen, and this has
spin-off effects.

00:28:04.450 --> 00:28:07.240
But not being Irish,
apart from [INAUDIBLE],

00:28:07.240 --> 00:28:09.540
I couldn't possibly comment,
though I'd like to--

00:28:09.540 --> 00:28:11.540
but maybe we could have
a quick chat afterwards.

00:28:11.540 --> 00:28:13.050
I'd like to know about that.

00:28:13.050 --> 00:28:14.580
Next question.

00:28:14.580 --> 00:28:19.100
AUDIENCE: You had mentioned
the purpose of the resurrection

00:28:19.100 --> 00:28:23.580
wasn't primarily yay, now
we all get eternal life,

00:28:23.580 --> 00:28:26.960
but to launch this new
creation, of which Jesus is the,

00:28:26.960 --> 00:28:30.720
I think you said the acting
agent and the first example of.

00:28:30.720 --> 00:28:31.480
N. T. WRIGHT: Put it close
to the mic [INAUDIBLE].

00:28:31.480 --> 00:28:32.521
AUDIENCE: Oh, sure, yeah.

00:28:32.521 --> 00:28:34.640
From a Biblical
theology perspective,

00:28:34.640 --> 00:28:38.070
usually, people consider the
cross the center of history.

00:28:38.070 --> 00:28:41.590
Would you say that instead, the
cross is typological of this

00:28:41.590 --> 00:28:43.715
greater thing that's actually
the center, or it's--

00:28:43.715 --> 00:28:44.714
N. T. WRIGHT: Thank you.

00:28:44.714 --> 00:28:45.400
That's good.

00:28:45.400 --> 00:28:47.640
I knew in talking
for 25 minutes that I

00:28:47.640 --> 00:28:49.240
was bound to give
hostages to fortune,

00:28:49.240 --> 00:28:52.070
and you just picked one of
them up, and that's fine.

00:28:52.070 --> 00:28:54.480
The cross and resurrection
go absolutely together.

00:28:54.480 --> 00:28:56.030
The resurrection
means what it means

00:28:56.030 --> 00:28:58.890
because it is the resurrection
of the Jesus who was crucified.

00:28:58.890 --> 00:29:01.604
If somebody had just happened
to die and three days later be

00:29:01.604 --> 00:29:04.020
found to be alive again, that
wouldn't have meant anything

00:29:04.020 --> 00:29:05.160
like the same thing.

00:29:05.160 --> 00:29:08.120
Likewise, the cross means
what it means in relation

00:29:08.120 --> 00:29:09.090
to the resurrection.

00:29:09.090 --> 00:29:12.476
Nobody at 6:00 PM on Good
Friday was saying, well,

00:29:12.476 --> 00:29:13.892
we've always
believed that someone

00:29:13.892 --> 00:29:15.160
is going to die for
the sins of the world.

00:29:15.160 --> 00:29:16.450
So he's done it, and
yeah, it was messy,

00:29:16.450 --> 00:29:18.616
but it's OK because he'll
be-- no, they just weren't

00:29:18.616 --> 00:29:20.210
thinking like that at all.

00:29:20.210 --> 00:29:22.650
They were absolutely
devastated and distraught,

00:29:22.650 --> 00:29:26.020
and the resurrection
compelled a total reevaluation

00:29:26.020 --> 00:29:28.900
of the meaning of
what just happened.

00:29:28.900 --> 00:29:30.510
There are 1,000 ways
you can say this,

00:29:30.510 --> 00:29:32.230
but pretty essential
is that they

00:29:32.230 --> 00:29:36.180
came to believe that if Jesus
had been raised from the dead,

00:29:36.180 --> 00:29:39.190
this meant that Death itself--
Death with a capital D,

00:29:39.190 --> 00:29:42.450
If you like-- had somehow
strangely been overcome,

00:29:42.450 --> 00:29:44.320
been beaten, been defeated.

00:29:44.320 --> 00:29:46.530
And then they said,
wait a minute.

00:29:46.530 --> 00:29:49.770
All those strange things
Jesus had said and done

00:29:49.770 --> 00:29:52.650
about his own forthcoming death,
which we didn't understand

00:29:52.650 --> 00:29:57.280
at the time-- maybe that
was about that on the cross,

00:29:57.280 --> 00:30:01.650
he was going to do that
somehow defeating of death

00:30:01.650 --> 00:30:03.830
and of the evil
which causes death.

00:30:03.830 --> 00:30:07.990
And so you get growing up very
early in Christianity theories

00:30:07.990 --> 00:30:10.760
about how the cross means
what it means in relation

00:30:10.760 --> 00:30:11.800
to the resurrection.

00:30:11.800 --> 00:30:14.540
And so because the
cross has defeated

00:30:14.540 --> 00:30:17.112
the power of evil and
of death, then Jesus

00:30:17.112 --> 00:30:19.320
is raised from the dead,
which wouldn't have happened

00:30:19.320 --> 00:30:21.440
otherwise, and
then a new world is

00:30:21.440 --> 00:30:24.250
opened, in which
humans can be rescued

00:30:24.250 --> 00:30:27.450
from evil, and sin, and
death, and ultimately,

00:30:27.450 --> 00:30:28.450
the whole creation.

00:30:28.450 --> 00:30:30.870
So that's broadly how
it works, though it

00:30:30.870 --> 00:30:34.330
takes large volumes of
theology to spell all that out

00:30:34.330 --> 00:30:34.926
and exegesis.

00:30:34.926 --> 00:30:36.550
Does that-- do you
see what I'm saying?

00:30:36.550 --> 00:30:37.320
AUDIENCE: Yes, thanks.

00:30:37.320 --> 00:30:38.445
N. T. WRIGHT: Good, thanks.

00:30:38.445 --> 00:30:39.512
OK, next question.

00:30:39.512 --> 00:30:41.220
AUDIENCE: This is
picking up a little bit

00:30:41.220 --> 00:30:44.120
off the woman from Ireland.

00:30:44.120 --> 00:30:45.880
We live in Silicon
Valley in 2015,

00:30:45.880 --> 00:30:48.310
which is very different
from the Greco-Roman world

00:30:48.310 --> 00:30:51.710
of the first century, so
if we take the scriptures

00:30:51.710 --> 00:30:54.510
as authoritative, how do
we go beyond the scriptures

00:30:54.510 --> 00:31:00.782
to seek to live wisely in a
very different world today?

00:31:00.782 --> 00:31:01.990
N. T. WRIGHT: Great question.

00:31:01.990 --> 00:31:04.350
Yes, we do live in a
very different world,

00:31:04.350 --> 00:31:07.207
and actually, people in the
third and fourth century

00:31:07.207 --> 00:31:09.290
lived in a very different
world from that of Jesus

00:31:09.290 --> 00:31:12.010
because the Jewish
bits of Jesus' world

00:31:12.010 --> 00:31:15.420
had more or less gone forever,
with AD 70, when Jerusalem was

00:31:15.420 --> 00:31:19.310
destroyed, and AD 135, when the
last great Jewish rebellion was

00:31:19.310 --> 00:31:20.610
put down by the Romans.

00:31:20.610 --> 00:31:21.520
Everything changed.

00:31:21.520 --> 00:31:25.070
And actually, as a result,
a lot of early Christians

00:31:25.070 --> 00:31:28.790
didn't understand some things
in the New Testament in the way

00:31:28.790 --> 00:31:31.790
that we can do up to
a point because we've

00:31:31.790 --> 00:31:35.290
got so much better information,
ironically, about early Judaism

00:31:35.290 --> 00:31:36.130
than they had.

00:31:36.130 --> 00:31:38.080
And the world has
changed again and again.

00:31:38.080 --> 00:31:39.607
It changed in the Middle Ages.

00:31:39.607 --> 00:31:40.940
It changed with the Renaissance.

00:31:40.940 --> 00:31:42.740
It changed with the
invention of printing.

00:31:42.740 --> 00:31:44.740
And obviously, what's
happened in Silicon Valley

00:31:44.740 --> 00:31:48.940
and elsewhere now is a
communications revolution

00:31:48.940 --> 00:31:52.150
of at least the same magnitude
as the invention of printing,

00:31:52.150 --> 00:31:56.660
and probably a different
magnitude entirely as well.

00:31:56.660 --> 00:31:59.100
However, what you find
in the New Testament

00:31:59.100 --> 00:32:02.330
is a sketch of
pictures and stories

00:32:02.330 --> 00:32:06.400
about ultimate new creation,
about the ultimate coming

00:32:06.400 --> 00:32:09.180
together of heaven
and Earth, and these

00:32:09.180 --> 00:32:13.490
are not meant as culture-bound
blueprints for what's

00:32:13.490 --> 00:32:16.800
going to happen but as
universal narratives,

00:32:16.800 --> 00:32:19.970
just like some of the best
poems are universal narratives,

00:32:19.970 --> 00:32:21.450
pointing forwards.

00:32:21.450 --> 00:32:24.640
And I've often said all our
language about the future,

00:32:24.640 --> 00:32:28.140
whether Jewish or Christian,
is a set of signposts

00:32:28.140 --> 00:32:30.046
pointing into a fog.

00:32:30.046 --> 00:32:32.170
They may be true signposts,
but they don't give you

00:32:32.170 --> 00:32:33.628
a photographic--
they're not trying

00:32:33.628 --> 00:32:35.890
to give you a photographic
reproduction of what

00:32:35.890 --> 00:32:37.650
you should expect to find.

00:32:37.650 --> 00:32:40.770
What they are saying is that
there will come a time when

00:32:40.770 --> 00:32:46.280
heaven and Earth will be joined
together completely forever,

00:32:46.280 --> 00:32:49.890
and that within that, there
will be a new world, which

00:32:49.890 --> 00:32:53.420
will be like the present one,
only much more so, much more

00:32:53.420 --> 00:32:56.940
flourishing, much more real,
so that the world itself,

00:32:56.940 --> 00:32:59.650
and us in particular--
we are at the present

00:32:59.650 --> 00:33:01.870
just a shadow of
our future selves.

00:33:01.870 --> 00:33:05.780
There's a real you that God
will make you and give you

00:33:05.780 --> 00:33:08.760
at the end that will
be recognizably you

00:33:08.760 --> 00:33:11.630
and just like you,
but so much more so.

00:33:11.630 --> 00:33:14.280
And that's what
resurrection is all about.

00:33:14.280 --> 00:33:16.540
So it seems to me that
though the culture's changed

00:33:16.540 --> 00:33:18.747
radically, and though
today's culture here

00:33:18.747 --> 00:33:20.580
is very different from
what you'd find, say,

00:33:20.580 --> 00:33:23.060
in many other parts of the
world today, India, or China,

00:33:23.060 --> 00:33:26.510
or wherever, the vision
of the New Testament

00:33:26.510 --> 00:33:29.690
is about the whole creation
and heaven and Earth not

00:33:29.690 --> 00:33:32.720
being miles apart from one
another but kind of overlapping

00:33:32.720 --> 00:33:35.750
and interlocking, and of that
being finally brought together.

00:33:35.750 --> 00:33:38.270
Within that, there
is this vision

00:33:38.270 --> 00:33:40.310
of human flourishing,
which I think does

00:33:40.310 --> 00:33:42.000
translate cross-culturally.

00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:44.350
And here's the point.

00:33:44.350 --> 00:33:48.100
Most of the Bible
is our back story,

00:33:48.100 --> 00:33:50.430
and it gives us little hints
as to where we're going.

00:33:50.430 --> 00:33:52.013
And as I've argued
in one of my books,

00:33:52.013 --> 00:33:53.630
"Scripture and the
Authority of God,"

00:33:53.630 --> 00:33:56.980
the Bible is like an
unfinished five-act play

00:33:56.980 --> 00:33:58.850
with little hints,
little sketches,

00:33:58.850 --> 00:34:02.050
as to what the last act, what
the last scene, looks like.

00:34:02.050 --> 00:34:04.350
But most of the
fifth act is missing,

00:34:04.350 --> 00:34:07.190
and our task, if we
want to be Biblical,

00:34:07.190 --> 00:34:10.659
is so to know the previous
four acts and the beginning

00:34:10.659 --> 00:34:14.050
of the fifth one that
we can improvise wisely

00:34:14.050 --> 00:34:15.480
to get to the fifth one.

00:34:15.480 --> 00:34:18.280
And that involves a
lot of translating out

00:34:18.280 --> 00:34:21.897
into different cultural
and historical situations.

00:34:21.897 --> 00:34:23.980
Does that scratch where
your question was itching?

00:34:23.980 --> 00:34:24.480
Yeah, good.

00:34:24.480 --> 00:34:25.250
Thank you.

00:34:25.250 --> 00:34:26.630
Question halfway back there.

00:34:26.630 --> 00:34:27.580
Yeah?

00:34:27.580 --> 00:34:29.955
AUDIENCE: I'm just curious if
I understand you correctly.

00:34:29.955 --> 00:34:33.030
If wisdom is
personified in Jesus,

00:34:33.030 --> 00:34:37.730
and if it's actually the
wise usage of information,

00:34:37.730 --> 00:34:40.480
does artificial
intelligence ultimately

00:34:40.480 --> 00:34:44.250
bring together
information and wisdom?

00:34:44.250 --> 00:34:46.171
And what would the
Bible or spirituality

00:34:46.171 --> 00:34:47.920
have to say about
artificial intelligence?

00:34:47.920 --> 00:34:49.380
N. T. WRIGHT: Yeah,
that's a great question,

00:34:49.380 --> 00:34:51.171
and I'd like to know
what you think of it--

00:34:51.171 --> 00:34:54.540
you all, plural-- think about
that, because it seems to me

00:34:54.540 --> 00:34:58.490
artificial intelligence
is likely to stay

00:34:58.490 --> 00:35:00.200
as good or as bad
as the people who

00:35:00.200 --> 00:35:02.140
are setting it up artificially.

00:35:02.140 --> 00:35:05.344
Now, I know that there's a big
debate as to whether ultimately

00:35:05.344 --> 00:35:06.760
computers will
take over the world

00:35:06.760 --> 00:35:08.551
and computers will do
everything that we do

00:35:08.551 --> 00:35:11.470
and be as smart as us
and smarter and so on.

00:35:11.470 --> 00:35:13.050
And it's interesting.

00:35:13.050 --> 00:35:15.780
There was a novel by the
British novelist David

00:35:15.780 --> 00:35:20.760
Lodge, who is kind of on the
edge of the Catholic faith,

00:35:20.760 --> 00:35:22.430
called "Thinks."

00:35:22.430 --> 00:35:24.940
This was maybe 10, 15 years ago.

00:35:24.940 --> 00:35:26.640
And the real subject
to that novel

00:35:26.640 --> 00:35:30.210
is this question, as to
whether computers can actually

00:35:30.210 --> 00:35:33.390
replicate every aspect
of human experience.

00:35:33.390 --> 00:35:37.000
And as the novel-- I
won't do a spoiler for you

00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:41.050
on how it works out, but what
eventually the characters

00:35:41.050 --> 00:35:45.470
in the novel discover is
that computers can't forgive,

00:35:45.470 --> 00:35:46.880
and they can't weep.

00:35:46.880 --> 00:35:48.590
They can't cry.

00:35:48.590 --> 00:35:50.620
And though-- it's very profound.

00:35:50.620 --> 00:35:52.620
I mean, there are probably
other things as well,

00:35:52.620 --> 00:35:53.830
like love and things.

00:35:53.830 --> 00:35:57.450
But the computer cannot
forgive, and it cannot weep.

00:35:57.450 --> 00:36:00.720
And I think Lodge is
saying these are actually

00:36:00.720 --> 00:36:03.750
things which humans do
and humans need to do,

00:36:03.750 --> 00:36:08.180
and which are part of what it
means to be genuinely human,

00:36:08.180 --> 00:36:11.470
and which we-- maybe we
just can't imagine it yet.

00:36:11.470 --> 00:36:13.460
Maybe somebody here
is inventing a machine

00:36:13.460 --> 00:36:15.430
that will weep and forgive.

00:36:15.430 --> 00:36:17.820
But you know what I'm
saying, that yeah,

00:36:17.820 --> 00:36:20.250
artificial intelligence is
hugely important, no doubt

00:36:20.250 --> 00:36:21.610
hugely useful.

00:36:21.610 --> 00:36:23.560
There are many things--
and at every stage

00:36:23.560 --> 00:36:27.080
of the technological advances
of the last 300 years,

00:36:27.080 --> 00:36:29.840
people have said, oh, dear,
are we making a Frankenstein,

00:36:29.840 --> 00:36:31.780
or are we doing a big monster?

00:36:31.780 --> 00:36:34.550
And I want to say, yeah,
that is often the problem.

00:36:34.550 --> 00:36:37.170
Some of the greatest historians
of the 20th century-- I'm

00:36:37.170 --> 00:36:39.690
thinking for instance of Herbert
Butterfield in Cambridge--

00:36:39.690 --> 00:36:43.575
were mightily exercised
after 1945 at the thought

00:36:43.575 --> 00:36:46.130
that the science and
technology that they

00:36:46.130 --> 00:36:48.480
had put their trust in,
that they believed in,

00:36:48.480 --> 00:36:50.420
that they thanked
God for, had been

00:36:50.420 --> 00:36:53.970
used to make atom bombs,
which were then dropped on two

00:36:53.970 --> 00:36:57.240
Japanese cities, and
now, a force, as it were,

00:36:57.240 --> 00:37:00.100
let loose in the world
that nobody knew what--

00:37:00.100 --> 00:37:01.890
that's a Frankenstein moment.

00:37:01.890 --> 00:37:03.100
And how did we get there?

00:37:03.100 --> 00:37:09.200
In other words, just because
the scientists and techies can,

00:37:09.200 --> 00:37:10.650
doesn't mean they should.

00:37:10.650 --> 00:37:14.190
And hence, the
wisdom to know what

00:37:14.190 --> 00:37:17.730
to do with the possibilities
that we have in front

00:37:17.730 --> 00:37:20.695
of us-- that's the difference
between information and wisdom,

00:37:20.695 --> 00:37:21.195
I think.

00:37:21.195 --> 00:37:23.236
AUDIENCE: What steps would
you recommend in order

00:37:23.236 --> 00:37:25.380
to navigate through
all this information

00:37:25.380 --> 00:37:26.782
in the new creation?

00:37:26.782 --> 00:37:28.200
N. T. WRIGHT: Wow.

00:37:28.200 --> 00:37:29.910
Oh goodness.

00:37:29.910 --> 00:37:31.950
There's no one-size-fits-all
answer for that.

00:37:31.950 --> 00:37:34.680
Somebody was asking me at lunch
about particular vocational

00:37:34.680 --> 00:37:37.700
issues, and vocation
is a fascinating thing.

00:37:37.700 --> 00:37:40.020
Sooner or later,
if we put ourselves

00:37:40.020 --> 00:37:43.910
in the way of finding out
what we're supposed to do,

00:37:43.910 --> 00:37:45.370
we may well discover.

00:37:45.370 --> 00:37:48.060
Often, it's difficult,
dangerous, complicated.

00:37:48.060 --> 00:37:50.530
We can none of us do
more than a tiny fraction

00:37:50.530 --> 00:37:52.660
of the things which ought
to be done in the world.

00:37:52.660 --> 00:37:55.900
That's why we need one
another in a global community.

00:37:55.900 --> 00:37:58.330
In New Testament language,
it's about the body of Christ,

00:37:58.330 --> 00:38:02.230
that we have different bits and
pieces, all gifted differently,

00:38:02.230 --> 00:38:06.540
but all aiming at the
same ultimate goal, which

00:38:06.540 --> 00:38:10.560
is the flourishing of God's
creation and the enabling

00:38:10.560 --> 00:38:14.000
of humans to be rescued from
everything that is preventing

00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:16.130
them from doing
that flourishing,

00:38:16.130 --> 00:38:19.640
and to rediscover what it
means to be genuinely human.

00:38:19.640 --> 00:38:22.760
In the Old Testament, this
again and again comes down--

00:38:22.760 --> 00:38:25.720
think of Psalm 72, where
you have this grand vision

00:38:25.720 --> 00:38:27.960
of the king who
is going to come,

00:38:27.960 --> 00:38:30.320
and he's going to bring
God's justice to the world.

00:38:30.320 --> 00:38:32.387
And again and again,
it says the main thing

00:38:32.387 --> 00:38:34.220
that he's going to do
is the priority number

00:38:34.220 --> 00:38:37.300
one, is to look after
the poor, to listen

00:38:37.300 --> 00:38:39.640
for the cry of the
needy, and to make sure

00:38:39.640 --> 00:38:41.070
that they get sorted out.

00:38:41.070 --> 00:38:42.570
Other things will
grow out of that.

00:38:42.570 --> 00:38:43.986
There are many
other things he has

00:38:43.986 --> 00:38:47.370
to do, many wonderful things of
culture and beauty and so on,

00:38:47.370 --> 00:38:49.100
but that's got to be
at the center of it.

00:38:49.100 --> 00:38:52.812
So I would say if you're
wondering how to do this,

00:38:52.812 --> 00:38:55.020
or you and your friends are
wondering how to do this,

00:38:55.020 --> 00:38:57.550
there are 1,000
different things which

00:38:57.550 --> 00:39:00.560
God needs people to
do wisely, but there

00:39:00.560 --> 00:39:04.140
are certain priorities,
and justice and beauty

00:39:04.140 --> 00:39:06.060
are pretty central to those.

00:39:06.060 --> 00:39:09.750
And the danger with
a kind of technology

00:39:09.750 --> 00:39:11.780
just doing what
it wants to do is

00:39:11.780 --> 00:39:15.530
that both justice and
beauty can get squeezed out,

00:39:15.530 --> 00:39:18.240
and you end up having something
which is super efficient,

00:39:18.240 --> 00:39:20.770
but which actually squelches
genuine humanness over

00:39:20.770 --> 00:39:23.070
on one side and does
not produce anything

00:39:23.070 --> 00:39:25.340
other than brutalist
boxes on the other.

00:39:25.340 --> 00:39:27.190
So some agendas there.

00:39:27.190 --> 00:39:29.880
AUDIENCE: Chapter
Five of Ephesians--

00:39:29.880 --> 00:39:33.060
the apostle Paul describes a
relationship between Christ

00:39:33.060 --> 00:39:35.480
and the church as
a profound mystery.

00:39:35.480 --> 00:39:38.656
What are your thoughts or
views on this profound mystery?

00:39:38.656 --> 00:39:39.410
[CHUCKLING]

00:39:39.410 --> 00:39:41.100
N. T. WRIGHT: Wow.

00:39:41.100 --> 00:39:45.200
The way Ephesians works is
that in Ephesians Chapter One,

00:39:45.200 --> 00:39:50.390
Paul says that's God's plan was
to sum up everything in heaven

00:39:50.390 --> 00:39:53.974
and on Earth in the Messiah,
in Jesus the Messiah.

00:39:53.974 --> 00:39:54.890
That's Ephesians 1:10.

00:39:54.890 --> 00:40:00.720
110 That's the sense that
the whole of creation, which

00:40:00.720 --> 00:40:03.782
is sort of bifocal--
heaven and Earth,

00:40:03.782 --> 00:40:05.490
God's bit and our bit,
if you like-- they

00:40:05.490 --> 00:40:06.680
were meant for each other.

00:40:06.680 --> 00:40:09.200
So much of Western cultures
assume that heaven and Earth

00:40:09.200 --> 00:40:10.422
are radically different.

00:40:10.422 --> 00:40:12.130
Your country was built
on that principle,

00:40:12.130 --> 00:40:15.810
on the Epicurean principle of
the total separation of church

00:40:15.810 --> 00:40:18.330
and state, of everything
that-- this is private,

00:40:18.330 --> 00:40:19.695
that's public, and so on.

00:40:19.695 --> 00:40:21.610
That's simply not the
Judeo Christian vision.

00:40:21.610 --> 00:40:23.610
I'm sorry to be so rude
about your Constitution,

00:40:23.610 --> 00:40:25.276
but that's just how it is.

00:40:25.276 --> 00:40:26.900
We have our problems
as well because we

00:40:26.900 --> 00:40:28.316
don't have a written
constitution,

00:40:28.316 --> 00:40:30.010
so we're just
muddled, and that's

00:40:30.010 --> 00:40:33.090
the usual British way
of going about things,

00:40:33.090 --> 00:40:35.330
to muddle on and hope
it'll all work out.

00:40:35.330 --> 00:40:37.950
But Ephesians One
says God's plan

00:40:37.950 --> 00:40:40.900
is to unite everything in
heaven and Earth in Christ.

00:40:40.900 --> 00:40:45.100
Ephesians Two says
that by rescuing people

00:40:45.100 --> 00:40:48.490
from all that was corrupting
their humanness-- sin, death,

00:40:48.490 --> 00:40:51.940
evil, wickedness, whatever--
God has brought together

00:40:51.940 --> 00:40:55.280
Jew and Gentile into
a single family, which

00:40:55.280 --> 00:40:57.344
constitutes the temple.

00:40:57.344 --> 00:40:58.760
That's the biggest
image you could

00:40:58.760 --> 00:40:59.926
have as a first-century Jew.

00:40:59.926 --> 00:41:02.670
The temple is where heaven
and Earth come together.

00:41:02.670 --> 00:41:06.500
So if Ephesians One and Two
are about heaven and Earth, Jew

00:41:06.500 --> 00:41:07.580
and Gentile.

00:41:07.580 --> 00:41:12.170
As a result, Chapter Three,
the principalities and powers

00:41:12.170 --> 00:41:15.160
take notice because
the Roman Empire,

00:41:15.160 --> 00:41:18.670
Greek philosophers would
love to find a system,

00:41:18.670 --> 00:41:21.910
a way of bringing together
everything in creation

00:41:21.910 --> 00:41:23.730
into one great hall.

00:41:23.730 --> 00:41:25.820
That's the imperial dream.

00:41:25.820 --> 00:41:30.940
And Paul says that through
the church being this people,

00:41:30.940 --> 00:41:32.315
the manifold wisdom
of God is now

00:41:32.315 --> 00:41:34.106
made known to the
principalities and powers

00:41:34.106 --> 00:41:35.260
in the heavenly places.

00:41:35.260 --> 00:41:37.090
That's Ephesians 3:10.

00:41:37.090 --> 00:41:41.080
Therefore, Chapter Four, which
is about unity and holiness

00:41:41.080 --> 00:41:43.640
within the church,
leads into this vision,

00:41:43.640 --> 00:41:46.010
as you say, in
Chapter Five, where

00:41:46.010 --> 00:41:49.160
that unity, which is the
messiah and his people,

00:41:49.160 --> 00:41:51.510
which is Jew and
Gentile, which is there

00:41:51.510 --> 00:41:56.390
in the face of the world--
that uniting is then seen also

00:41:56.390 --> 00:41:58.970
in the uniting of husband
and wife because Paul

00:41:58.970 --> 00:42:02.080
has Genesis One and Two
in mind all along, so

00:42:02.080 --> 00:42:03.960
that these different
complementaries,

00:42:03.960 --> 00:42:08.070
these different unities, are all
pointing in the same direction.

00:42:08.070 --> 00:42:10.830
And ultimately, the messiah
and his people-- that image

00:42:10.830 --> 00:42:14.440
picks up from the Old Testament
image of God and Israel,

00:42:14.440 --> 00:42:17.350
with Israel as God's
bride or God's wife.

00:42:17.350 --> 00:42:19.270
And it's all about covenant.

00:42:19.270 --> 00:42:20.440
It's all about faithfulness.

00:42:20.440 --> 00:42:22.770
And the point of the
covenants and the faithfulness

00:42:22.770 --> 00:42:24.892
is precisely new
creation, and hence,

00:42:24.892 --> 00:42:26.600
the fruitfulness of
the man and the woman

00:42:26.600 --> 00:42:30.829
being to do with the
Genesis One mandate,

00:42:30.829 --> 00:42:32.120
being fruitful and multiplying.

00:42:32.120 --> 00:42:35.830
So then, surprise,
surprise, Ephesians

00:42:35.830 --> 00:42:39.210
Chapter Six is about
spiritual warfare

00:42:39.210 --> 00:42:41.160
because when heaven and
Earth come together,

00:42:41.160 --> 00:42:42.810
when Jew and Gentile
come together,

00:42:42.810 --> 00:42:44.920
when male and female
come together,

00:42:44.920 --> 00:42:47.820
then there is a sign set
up in the cosmos which

00:42:47.820 --> 00:42:51.160
says Jesus is Lord, and
that is a sign which

00:42:51.160 --> 00:42:54.920
is deeply contested and
often deeply unpopular,

00:42:54.920 --> 00:42:57.170
and people get into
trouble for saying it.

00:42:57.170 --> 00:43:01.000
So that's basically both
within Ephesians as a whole

00:43:01.000 --> 00:43:04.055
and, I would say, hinting within
Biblical theology as a whole.

00:43:04.055 --> 00:43:04.555
Sorry.

00:43:04.555 --> 00:43:06.950
Huge question, and a huge
answer, but there we are.

00:43:06.950 --> 00:43:08.410
AUDIENCE: Yeah, just going
off a couple of the things

00:43:08.410 --> 00:43:10.187
that that gentleman
over there asked

00:43:10.187 --> 00:43:11.770
and a couple other
things, I sometimes

00:43:11.770 --> 00:43:16.820
think when I'm in my vocation
as a follower of Jesus that

00:43:16.820 --> 00:43:19.720
especially growing up
here, being born and raised

00:43:19.720 --> 00:43:22.030
in Silicon Valley-- and my
father was in this industry,

00:43:22.030 --> 00:43:24.613
and I'm in this industry, and
my wife works in it, et cetera--

00:43:24.613 --> 00:43:28.090
that I get the economy of
God confused sometimes.

00:43:28.090 --> 00:43:30.681
And sometimes, when I'm
at work, I'm given a task.

00:43:30.681 --> 00:43:32.680
I just want to get your
comment on this thought.

00:43:32.680 --> 00:43:34.960
I'm given a task that's
very specific to work

00:43:34.960 --> 00:43:36.400
on something very specific.

00:43:36.400 --> 00:43:37.860
But sometimes, I
think the reason

00:43:37.860 --> 00:43:40.985
I'm there is to serve those
around me, like God did with--

00:43:40.985 --> 00:43:42.360
or like Christ
did with the woman

00:43:42.360 --> 00:43:46.350
at the well or those examples,
the woman caught in adultery.

00:43:46.350 --> 00:43:49.320
Both those stories are
just so intriguing to me,

00:43:49.320 --> 00:43:51.890
and I just want to get
that thought from you.

00:43:51.890 --> 00:43:53.310
What would you think about that?

00:43:53.310 --> 00:43:55.768
When I'm at work, yeah, I'm
supposed to be doing this work,

00:43:55.768 --> 00:43:57.050
but sometimes I'm conflicted.

00:43:57.050 --> 00:44:00.440
I feel like I'm really supposed
to be serving those around me.

00:44:00.440 --> 00:44:03.290
N. T. WRIGHT: Yeah, human life
is deliciously complicated.

00:44:03.290 --> 00:44:09.750
I mean, humans simply are all
sorts of different related

00:44:09.750 --> 00:44:11.480
things, and if
you stop and think

00:44:11.480 --> 00:44:18.230
about music, and food, and love,
and travel, and beauty, and so

00:44:18.230 --> 00:44:20.910
on, you realize that just
to be an ordinary human

00:44:20.910 --> 00:44:23.630
is already to be
someone in which all

00:44:23.630 --> 00:44:27.240
these different enormous
things come together,

00:44:27.240 --> 00:44:29.560
and often, they knock
sparks off each other.

00:44:29.560 --> 00:44:32.650
That's why poetry, and plays,
and music, and theater,

00:44:32.650 --> 00:44:35.700
and cinema, and so
on are what they are.

00:44:35.700 --> 00:44:38.750
They're bringing together of
different aspects of our life

00:44:38.750 --> 00:44:41.380
and suddenly showing us
that there are connections,

00:44:41.380 --> 00:44:42.740
and it's very, very exciting.

00:44:42.740 --> 00:44:47.420
Now, because we want to get
stuff done for our vocations,

00:44:47.420 --> 00:44:50.150
for our job to earn a
living, we have to focus.

00:44:50.150 --> 00:44:52.820
If my task is to dig
ditches, then I've

00:44:52.820 --> 00:44:54.610
just got to get on
and dig this ditch.

00:44:54.610 --> 00:44:56.930
Now, there may well be also
things going on in my mind.

00:44:56.930 --> 00:44:58.260
I may be singing
a song to myself.

00:44:58.260 --> 00:45:00.468
I may be thinking about the
book I was reading in bed

00:45:00.468 --> 00:45:01.960
last night, whatever it is.

00:45:01.960 --> 00:45:04.870
And then, if the person
digging the ditch next to me

00:45:04.870 --> 00:45:08.900
starts singing a different
song, telling a different story,

00:45:08.900 --> 00:45:10.830
or starts weeping
because of something

00:45:10.830 --> 00:45:13.524
that's happened in their
life, then OK, we still

00:45:13.524 --> 00:45:14.440
have to dig the ditch.

00:45:14.440 --> 00:45:15.570
That's got to be done.

00:45:15.570 --> 00:45:18.420
But we have to
figure out how then

00:45:18.420 --> 00:45:21.070
to say hey, let's go and
get a beer at halftime

00:45:21.070 --> 00:45:23.420
and see what's going on.

00:45:23.420 --> 00:45:26.430
And in my experience,
I've done some silly jobs

00:45:26.430 --> 00:45:28.920
where I've tried to
combine different things--

00:45:28.920 --> 00:45:31.290
pastoral responsibilities,
academic responsibilities,

00:45:31.290 --> 00:45:34.410
teaching, administrative
things-- and you just bounce

00:45:34.410 --> 00:45:35.710
to and fro as best you can.

00:45:35.710 --> 00:45:38.168
Now, it's easy for me because
I'm a seven on the Enneagram,

00:45:38.168 --> 00:45:40.450
and Enneagram sevens
love bouncing to and fro.

00:45:40.450 --> 00:45:41.930
Some of you will know.

00:45:41.930 --> 00:45:43.510
So that that's OK,
but some people

00:45:43.510 --> 00:45:45.670
find it really difficult
to change gear,

00:45:45.670 --> 00:45:47.890
and sometimes I found it
difficult to change gear.

00:45:47.890 --> 00:45:50.140
However, I found
again and again,

00:45:50.140 --> 00:45:54.960
if one is attuned to where
human need around you

00:45:54.960 --> 00:45:57.020
is-- this relates
to the remembering

00:45:57.020 --> 00:46:02.630
the poor business-- then
interestingly, often,

00:46:02.630 --> 00:46:05.040
when there is a need
suddenly present to you

00:46:05.040 --> 00:46:06.830
that maybe you
should be meeting,

00:46:06.830 --> 00:46:12.010
there will be a way of coming
to that and of doing something--

00:46:12.010 --> 00:46:15.660
when I was Bishop of
Durham, I would often

00:46:15.660 --> 00:46:19.470
find that my diary was
absolutely full wall to wall,

00:46:19.470 --> 00:46:23.420
and then I would get a phone
call saying that, say, one

00:46:23.420 --> 00:46:25.730
of the clergy-- a child had
just been killed in a road

00:46:25.730 --> 00:46:27.140
accident or something.

00:46:27.140 --> 00:46:28.848
I'd think, oh, I need
to go and see them.

00:46:28.848 --> 00:46:30.646
But look, I've got--
and then the secretary

00:46:30.646 --> 00:46:32.020
would say, oh, by
the way, I just

00:46:32.020 --> 00:46:35.090
had a call that your 3 o'clock
appointment's just canceled.

00:46:35.090 --> 00:46:35.590
Right.

00:46:35.590 --> 00:46:35.860
Get in the car.

00:46:35.860 --> 00:46:37.180
We're going to see them.

00:46:37.180 --> 00:46:39.950
And that happened so
often in the seven years

00:46:39.950 --> 00:46:42.744
I was doing that job that I
thought that this actually--

00:46:42.744 --> 00:46:43.910
I'm being looked after here.

00:46:43.910 --> 00:46:46.890
I need to be there, and
so a space opens up.

00:46:46.890 --> 00:46:48.970
Now, I'm not saying that
I live a charmed life,

00:46:48.970 --> 00:46:49.940
because I don't.

00:46:49.940 --> 00:46:53.244
I'm not saying I'm always well
organized, because I'm not.

00:46:53.244 --> 00:46:54.910
I actually need my
wife in the front row

00:46:54.910 --> 00:46:59.620
to stare at me as though to say
you telling these nice stories

00:46:59.620 --> 00:47:00.620
about how it works out.

00:47:00.620 --> 00:47:02.260
You know perfectly
well it doesn't.

00:47:02.260 --> 00:47:03.610
[LAUGHTER]

00:47:03.610 --> 00:47:05.700
I have a lovely cartoon
framed in my room,

00:47:05.700 --> 00:47:09.210
which is of a bishop and his
wife driving away from church,

00:47:09.210 --> 00:47:11.180
and the bishop is
saying to his wife,

00:47:11.180 --> 00:47:14.190
"Have you considered how much
more effective my sermon would

00:47:14.190 --> 00:47:16.943
have been if you
haven't yelled, 'ha!'"

00:47:16.943 --> 00:47:19.410
[LAUGHTER]

00:47:19.410 --> 00:47:20.290
So there.

00:47:20.290 --> 00:47:22.420
AUDIENCE: You
mentioned in Ephesians

00:47:22.420 --> 00:47:25.090
at the very end, Chapter Six,
about the spiritual battle

00:47:25.090 --> 00:47:27.800
and the idea of
principalities and powers.

00:47:27.800 --> 00:47:30.375
And in Silicon Valley
and information

00:47:30.375 --> 00:47:33.870
and technique and everything,
between information and wisdom,

00:47:33.870 --> 00:47:36.705
what is the battle in
terms of our relationship

00:47:36.705 --> 00:47:39.607
to principalities and powers
as it relates to this context?

00:47:39.607 --> 00:47:41.190
N. T. WRIGHT: That's
a great question,

00:47:41.190 --> 00:47:43.040
and I'm not sure that
I'm the right person

00:47:43.040 --> 00:47:45.039
to answer it because I
don't live and work here,

00:47:45.039 --> 00:47:46.460
and I really don't know.

00:47:46.460 --> 00:47:50.500
I would guess, however, that
there are enormous forces

00:47:50.500 --> 00:47:53.990
in economics, in
technology, in America,

00:47:53.990 --> 00:47:56.350
in the Western world
in general, where you

00:47:56.350 --> 00:47:58.140
do want to ask the question.

00:47:58.140 --> 00:48:00.171
We all have to
ask this question.

00:48:00.171 --> 00:48:02.420
I, as an academic teaching
students and writing books,

00:48:02.420 --> 00:48:03.690
have to answer the question.

00:48:03.690 --> 00:48:06.170
Are we actually going to work
to build the Tower of Babel?

00:48:06.170 --> 00:48:07.460
Is that what we're doing?

00:48:07.460 --> 00:48:11.920
An all-human work is always
in danger of arrogance.

00:48:11.920 --> 00:48:14.460
That's why when you think
about the problem in the world,

00:48:14.460 --> 00:48:16.100
don't just look
at Genesis Three.

00:48:16.100 --> 00:48:19.100
Look at Genesis 3
through to Genesis 11

00:48:19.100 --> 00:48:22.840
because here's the thing.

00:48:22.840 --> 00:48:27.200
The human task in the
beginning is about community.

00:48:27.200 --> 00:48:29.010
It's about
replenishing the Earth,

00:48:29.010 --> 00:48:32.390
about doing community,
about family, about land,

00:48:32.390 --> 00:48:35.570
about getting this
stuff sorted out.

00:48:35.570 --> 00:48:38.360
After Adam and Eve rebel,
whatever that means,

00:48:38.360 --> 00:48:40.620
picture language, et cetera,
one of the first things

00:48:40.620 --> 00:48:43.950
that happened is the first
murder-- Cain murdering Abel.

00:48:43.950 --> 00:48:46.375
But then, when Cain goes
off, what does he do?

00:48:46.375 --> 00:48:48.100
He builds a city.

00:48:48.100 --> 00:48:50.920
He still knows that
doing human community

00:48:50.920 --> 00:48:53.510
is the thing you're
supposed to do.

00:48:53.510 --> 00:48:58.000
But what happens to the city--
not his city, but later on--

00:48:58.000 --> 00:49:00.030
is that the city
becomes arrogant.

00:49:00.030 --> 00:49:01.500
Let's build a tower.

00:49:01.500 --> 00:49:02.830
The top reaches to heaven.

00:49:02.830 --> 00:49:04.920
And then, we will be it.

00:49:04.920 --> 00:49:06.940
We will be the people.

00:49:06.940 --> 00:49:11.020
And God comes down and
spoils it all, of course.

00:49:11.020 --> 00:49:15.430
And so there's a sense
that all human projects

00:49:15.430 --> 00:49:18.220
have the capacity to turn
into the Tower of Babel.

00:49:18.220 --> 00:49:20.510
And if somebody sees
that going on and says,

00:49:20.510 --> 00:49:21.420
hey, wait a minute.

00:49:21.420 --> 00:49:23.630
We're just doing this because
we want to be powerful.

00:49:23.630 --> 00:49:24.421
We want to be rich.

00:49:24.421 --> 00:49:26.630
We want to be arrogant
and rule the world.

00:49:26.630 --> 00:49:29.410
Then if somebody is
calling time on that,

00:49:29.410 --> 00:49:32.560
blowing the whistle on that,
that's a very dangerous place

00:49:32.560 --> 00:49:35.080
to be because when--
OK, here's the thing.

00:49:35.080 --> 00:49:38.350
When humans worship
that which is not God,

00:49:38.350 --> 00:49:42.100
whether it's power, or money,
or sex, or whatever it is,

00:49:42.100 --> 00:49:46.760
humans give to that dark
force, which we loosely

00:49:46.760 --> 00:49:51.970
label like that, the power
which we ought to have,

00:49:51.970 --> 00:49:54.720
but which in fact we're
giving to these forces.

00:49:54.720 --> 00:49:56.754
We call them forces.

00:49:56.754 --> 00:49:57.920
We don't have good language.

00:49:57.920 --> 00:49:59.840
They didn't have good language
for it in the ancient world.

00:49:59.840 --> 00:50:02.470
We don't in today's world
because it's actually not

00:50:02.470 --> 00:50:05.200
really nameable.

00:50:05.200 --> 00:50:08.870
And then, these
forces rule over us.

00:50:08.870 --> 00:50:11.550
And if we get in their
way, they will crush us.

00:50:11.550 --> 00:50:14.920
But that doesn't absolve
us from the responsibility

00:50:14.920 --> 00:50:17.370
of naming the problems
that we're up against.

00:50:17.370 --> 00:50:19.870
So I'm not saying that Silicon
Valley is the Tower of Babel.

00:50:19.870 --> 00:50:20.412
It isn't.

00:50:20.412 --> 00:50:22.870
There's so many good things
that happen as a result of what

00:50:22.870 --> 00:50:23.650
you guys do.

00:50:23.650 --> 00:50:25.990
But every human
enterprise, including

00:50:25.990 --> 00:50:28.370
the one that I work
in, has the capacity

00:50:28.370 --> 00:50:31.240
to become self-idolatrous,
Babel-like,

00:50:31.240 --> 00:50:34.230
and we have to name that and
deal with it as best we can,

00:50:34.230 --> 00:50:35.710
preferably wisely.

00:50:35.710 --> 00:50:37.586
OK, time for probably
just one more question.

00:50:37.586 --> 00:50:38.085
I'm sorry.

00:50:38.085 --> 00:50:39.930
I'm seeing lots of
hands over there.

00:50:39.930 --> 00:50:46.140
I'm not running away immediately
afterwards, so well, OK.

00:50:46.140 --> 00:50:47.130
You got it.

00:50:47.130 --> 00:50:48.130
AUDIENCE: Oh, thank you.

00:50:48.130 --> 00:50:51.520
Your story-- you said about
the background of the gospel

00:50:51.520 --> 00:50:52.179
and your--

00:50:52.179 --> 00:50:53.720
N. T. WRIGHT: Hold
the microphone up.

00:50:53.720 --> 00:50:57.210
AUDIENCE: --your example of the
background story of the gospel,

00:50:57.210 --> 00:50:59.810
and you talked about
your story of rugby,

00:50:59.810 --> 00:51:01.460
and that's such a
great example for us

00:51:01.460 --> 00:51:04.020
here to realize that
if you don't understand

00:51:04.020 --> 00:51:07.130
the culture and the
passion that's behind that,

00:51:07.130 --> 00:51:09.480
it's hard to really
understand it coming from you.

00:51:09.480 --> 00:51:13.560
But those of us who've
experienced it of course

00:51:13.560 --> 00:51:14.652
can relate better.

00:51:14.652 --> 00:51:16.860
I've been trying to understand
the New Testament more

00:51:16.860 --> 00:51:21.660
accurately and studying Hebrew
idioms of the first century

00:51:21.660 --> 00:51:23.090
within Judaism.

00:51:23.090 --> 00:51:25.060
It's really unified
the New Testament

00:51:25.060 --> 00:51:27.320
and connected it to the old.

00:51:27.320 --> 00:51:30.260
Even better, I'm wondering about
your studies of Hebrew idioms

00:51:30.260 --> 00:51:32.360
within first century Judaism.

00:51:32.360 --> 00:51:34.799
Paul uses them
throughout his Epistles.

00:51:34.799 --> 00:51:36.340
You find it through
the Book of Acts,

00:51:36.340 --> 00:51:37.970
and it's clarified a lot for me.

00:51:37.970 --> 00:51:39.589
I'm wonder about
your studies in that.

00:51:39.589 --> 00:51:41.630
N. T. WRIGHT: Yeah, this
is a technical question,

00:51:41.630 --> 00:51:45.350
so let me just give
a brief answer.

00:51:45.350 --> 00:51:47.870
Every generation in the
church, at its best,

00:51:47.870 --> 00:51:51.160
has known that you need
to understand the Bible

00:51:51.160 --> 00:51:53.300
in its original context.

00:51:53.300 --> 00:51:56.930
Now, of course, you then need
to live it in your own context,

00:51:56.930 --> 00:51:59.640
and there's always a
dialogue between those two.

00:51:59.640 --> 00:52:01.210
I am one of the
lucky ones who's been

00:52:01.210 --> 00:52:03.800
able to spend my lifestyle
studying-- I was trained

00:52:03.800 --> 00:52:07.200
as an ancient historian
before I was a theologian,

00:52:07.200 --> 00:52:10.287
so I love going back
into the first century

00:52:10.287 --> 00:52:12.370
and trying to make sense
of what's going on there,

00:52:12.370 --> 00:52:16.091
and that means the languages,
the texts, et cetera.

00:52:16.091 --> 00:52:18.340
Particularly-- I'll just
give you one example of that,

00:52:18.340 --> 00:52:22.590
because then we must stop-- the
way that other first century

00:52:22.590 --> 00:52:26.110
Jews, or the ways that other
first century Jews were reading

00:52:26.110 --> 00:52:29.350
their scriptures, are
absolutely fascinating

00:52:29.350 --> 00:52:32.580
and help us to see how
the early Christians then

00:52:32.580 --> 00:52:35.760
were reading the same scriptures
in the light of what had just

00:52:35.760 --> 00:52:37.890
happened to Jesus.

00:52:37.890 --> 00:52:40.540
And there's all sorts of
overlap and interplay.

00:52:40.540 --> 00:52:41.890
Take the Dead Sea Scrolls.

00:52:41.890 --> 00:52:44.570
The Dead Sea Scrolls-- you
have a lot of scrolls which are

00:52:44.570 --> 00:52:46.550
simply exegesis of scripture.

00:52:46.550 --> 00:52:50.000
They take [INAUDIBLE],
one of the other prophets

00:52:50.000 --> 00:52:52.800
or the psalms, and
they do exegesis,

00:52:52.800 --> 00:52:54.530
and they apply it
to their own day.

00:52:54.530 --> 00:52:56.270
And we can see the
early Christians

00:52:56.270 --> 00:52:58.940
doing the same thing, except
in the light of Jesus.

00:52:58.940 --> 00:53:02.320
And that's a fascinating
exercise, which sometimes comes

00:53:02.320 --> 00:53:05.580
very, very close, so close
that you'd think they're just

00:53:05.580 --> 00:53:07.080
looking over each
other's shoulders,

00:53:07.080 --> 00:53:09.490
and sometimes it's
quite different.

00:53:09.490 --> 00:53:11.880
One of the key things, of
course, being that many,

00:53:11.880 --> 00:53:14.340
many Jews-- not all--
in the first century

00:53:14.340 --> 00:53:17.470
believed that when God was
going to do what God was going

00:53:17.470 --> 00:53:18.990
to do for Israel
and the world, it

00:53:18.990 --> 00:53:23.930
would involve an actual battle,
a real bloodbath, a fight,

00:53:23.930 --> 00:53:26.450
and that God would lead them
in victory against the pagan

00:53:26.450 --> 00:53:26.950
hordes.

00:53:26.950 --> 00:53:30.700
It had happened before in 164
with the Maccabean Revolt,

00:53:30.700 --> 00:53:32.380
and they hoped it
would happen again.

00:53:32.380 --> 00:53:35.850
One of the most important
things about the early Christian

00:53:35.850 --> 00:53:39.060
vision is that because they knew
Jesus, the crucified and risen

00:53:39.060 --> 00:53:42.880
one, when they talk about the
battle which is going to come,

00:53:42.880 --> 00:53:46.160
it's not one which humans will
fight in the ordinary way,

00:53:46.160 --> 00:53:47.930
hence the sermon on the mount.

00:53:47.930 --> 00:53:51.500
When God becomes king, he
doesn't send in the tanks.

00:53:51.500 --> 00:53:53.410
He sends in the meek,
and the mourners,

00:53:53.410 --> 00:53:55.785
and the brokenhearted, and
the hungry-for-justice people,

00:53:55.785 --> 00:53:56.710
and the peacemakers.

00:53:56.710 --> 00:53:59.640
That's how God's kingdom
comes on Earth as in heaven.

00:53:59.640 --> 00:54:02.980
And we still have quite a lot
to do to learn about that stuff.

00:54:02.980 --> 00:54:04.585
MALE SPEAKER: [INAUDIBLE].

00:54:04.585 --> 00:54:05.960
N. T. WRIGHT: I
think we're done.

00:54:05.960 --> 00:54:09.910
