00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:02.190
&gt;&gt; Knowing your family history can help

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:04.180
determine medical information as well as other

00:00:04.180 --> 00:00:09.150
general traits. But it can also help you trace your past, From close to distant.

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:10.480
&gt;&gt; Now, because of evolution we know that

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:12.210
were all connected at the very least as

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:14.680
cousins. But, obviously we look more like some

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:16.670
of our family members than we do others.

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:18.430
&gt;&gt; Now discovering all of your different

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:20.950
genetic connections deep within your family tree can

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:23.560
be really difficult. So you'll need a genetic

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:25.840
genealogist to help you with this. They can

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:27.880
help you make all of these complex connections.

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:32.049
&gt;&gt; And, moreover, you don't need a, a specialized graduated degree or,

00:00:32.049 --> 00:00:34.830
even a specialized degree in genetics at all to do this job.
