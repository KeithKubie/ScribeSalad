00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.160
A social institution that has one of the biggest
impacts on society is the economy.

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:10.360
And you might think of the economy in terms
of numbers – unemployment numbers, GDPs, or
whatever the stock market is doing today.

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:14.660
But while we often talk about it in numerical
terms, the economy is really made of people!

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:19.660
It’s the social institution that organizes
all production, consumption, and trade of
goods in a society.

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:23.520
And there are lots of different ways in which
stuff can be made, exchanged, and used.

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:25.420
Think capitalism, or socialism.

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:31.600
These economic systems – and the
economic revolutions that created them –
shape the way that people live their lives.

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:42.460
[Theme Music]

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:50.120
Economies can vary a lot from one society to the
next, but in any given economy, you can typically
see production split into three sectors.

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:56.640
The primary sector extracts raw materials
from natural environments – so, workers like
farmers or miners would fit well here.

00:00:56.649 --> 00:01:01.240
The secondary sector takes raw materials and
transforms them into manufactured goods.

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:08.980
So, someone in the primary sector may extract
oil from the earth, but someone in the secondary
sector refines the petroleum into gasoline.

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:13.400
And then the tertiary sector is the part of
the economy that involves services rather
than goods.

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:15.420
You know, doing things, rather than making
things.

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:18.160
But, this system is actually pretty complicated.

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:22.560
Or at least, more sophisticated than the way
things used to be for much of human history.

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:30.240
So, how did we get from a world where people worked
to produce just what they needed for their families,
to one with all these sectors that have to work together?

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:34.000
To understand that, we need to back up a little
– about 12,000 years.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.210
The first big economic change was the agrarian
revolution.

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:40.040
When people first learned how to
domesticate plants and animals,

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:45.620
it ushered in a new agricultural economy that was much
more productive than hunter-gatherer societies were.

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:51.020
Farming helped societies build surpluses,
which meant not everyone had to spend their
time producing food.

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:56.640
This, in turn, led to major developments like
permanent settlements, trade networks, and
population growth.

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:02.860
Now, let’s go to the Thought Bubble to
discuss the second major economic revolution:
the industrial revolution of the 1800s.

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:08.520
With the rise of industry came new economic
tools, like steam engines, manufacturing,
and mass production.

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:10.940
Factories popped up, changing how work functioned.

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:15.980
Now, instead of working at home, where
people worked for their family by making
things from start to finish,

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:20.400
they began working as wage laborers and
becoming more specialized in their skills.

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:28.720
Overall productivity went up, standards of living rose,
and people had access to a wider variety of goods
thanks to mass production – all good things.

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:32.020
But every economic revolution comes with economic
casualties.

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:37.400
The workers in the factories – who were
mainly poor women and children – worked
in dangerous conditions for low wages.

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:41.580
There’s a reason that the industrialists
of the 19th century were known as robber barons:

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:46.520
with more productivity came greater wealth,
but also greater economic inequality.

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:50.240
So, in the late 19th century, labor unions
began to form.

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:56.400
These organizations of workers sought to improve
wages and working conditions through collective
action, strikes, and negotiations.

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:01.840
Inspired by Marxist principles, labor unions
are partly to thank for us now having things
like minimum wage laws,

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:05.620
reasonable working hours, and regulations
to protect the safety of workers.

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:06.780
Thanks Thought Bubble.

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:13.100
So, the industrial revolution was an incredibly
big deal, when it came to the changes that it
brought to both economies and societies.

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:17.340
And there’s a third revolution we should
talk about too – one that’s happening right now.

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:23.440
But before we get to that, we should pause and
explore two competing economic models that sprung
up around the time of the industrial revolution,

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:26.540
as economic capital became more and more
important to the production of goods.

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:27.860
Pretty sure you’ve heard of them!

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:30.200
And possibly have strong opinions about them!

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:31.900
They’re capitalism and socialism.

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:36.400
Capitalism is a system in which all natural resources
and means of production are privately owned.

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:40.319
And it emphasizes profit-seeking and competition
as the main drivers of efficiency.

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:44.480
If you own a business, you need to out-perform
your competitors if you're going to succeed.

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:49.380
So you’re incentivized to be more efficient
– by improving the quality of your product,
and reducing your prices.

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:54.300
This is what economist Adam Smith in the 1770s
called the “Invisible Hand” of the market.

00:03:54.300 --> 00:04:01.780
The idea is that if you just leave a capitalist economy
alone, consumers will regulate things themselves, by
selecting goods and services that provide the best value.

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:06.080
But, in practice, an economy doesn’t work
very well if it’s left completely on auto-pilot.

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:10.720
There are lots of sectors where a hands-off approach
can lead to what economists call “market failures,”

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:14.460
where an unregulated market ends up
allocating goods and services inefficiently.

00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:17.440
A monopoly, for example, is a kind of market
failure.

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:22.840
When a company has no competition for
customers, it can charge higher prices without
worrying about losing customers.

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:27.540
That, as economic allocations go, is really
inefficient, at least on the consumer end.

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:33.800
So, in situations like these, a government
might step in and force the company to break up
into smaller companies to increase competition.

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:39.480
Market failures like this are why most
countries, the United States included, are
not purely capitalist societies.

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:45.960
For example, the US federal and state governments
own and operate a number of businesses, like schools,
the Postal Service, and the military.

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:52.700
Governments also set minimum wages, create
workplace safety laws, and provide social support
programs like unemployment benefits and food stamps.

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:55.840
Government plays an even larger role, however,
in socialism.

00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:59.200
In a socialist system, the means of production
are under collective ownership.

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:03.240
Socialism rejects capitalism’s private-property
and hands-off approaches.

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:09.520
Instead, here, property is owned by the
government and allocated to all citizens, not
just those with the money to afford it.

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:18.880
Socialism emphasizes collective goals, expecting
everyone to work for the common good, and placing a
higher value on meeting everyone’s basic needs than on
individual profit.

00:05:18.889 --> 00:05:23.380
When Karl Marx first wrote about socialism,
he viewed it as a stepping stone toward communism,

00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:27.160
a political and economic system in which all
members of a society are socially equal.

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:35.880
But of course, in practice, this hasn’t played out
in the countries that have modelled their economies
on socialism, like Cuba, North Korea, China,
and the former USSR.

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:36.720
Why?

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:43.680
Well, Marx hoped that, as economic differences
vanished in communist society, the government
would simply wither away and disappear.

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:45.540
But, that never happened.

00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:47.240
If anything, the opposite did.

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:52.000
Rather than freeing the proletariat from inequality,
the massive power of the government in these

00:05:52.000 --> 00:06:00.160
states gave enormous wealth, power, and privilege
to political elites, retrenching inequalities along political
– rather than strictly economic – lines.

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:05.080
At the same time, capitalist countries economically
out-performed their socialist counterparts,

00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:09.100
contributing to the unrest that eventually
led to the downfall of the USSR.

00:06:09.100 --> 00:06:18.780
Before the fall of the Soviet Union, the average output in capitalist countries was about $13,500 per person, which was almost three times that in the Soviet countries.

00:06:18.780 --> 00:06:22.680
But there are downsides to capitalism, too
– namely greater income inequality.

00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:26.840
A study of European capitalist countries
and socialist countries in the 1970s

00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:36.480
found that the income ratio between the top 5%
and the bottom 5% in capitalist countries was about
10:1, whereas in socialist countries it was 5:1.

00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:41.240
We could fill whole episodes about the
merits of each economic model – and in fact,
we did in Crash Course World History.

00:06:41.250 --> 00:06:46.140
There are many more questions we could answer
about how societies build their economic systems.

00:06:46.150 --> 00:06:49.650
But in any case, those two models aren’t
the end of the story.

00:06:49.650 --> 00:06:55.340
Because: we’re living in the middle of the economic
revolution that followed the industrial revolution.

00:06:55.340 --> 00:06:58.040
Ours is the time of the information revolution.

00:06:58.040 --> 00:07:02.840
Technology has reduced the role of human labor,
and shifted it from a manufacturing-based economy

00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:06.480
to one based on service work and the
production of ideas rather than goods.

00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:09.540
And this has had a lot of residual effects
on our economy.

00:07:09.540 --> 00:07:16.220
Computers and other technologies are beginning
to replace many jobs, by making it easier to either
automate them or send them offshore.

00:07:16.220 --> 00:07:18.599
And we’ve also seen a decline in union membership.

00:07:18.600 --> 00:07:21.580
Nowadays, most unions are for public sector
jobs, like teachers.

00:07:21.580 --> 00:07:24.740
So what do jobs in a post-industrial society
look like?

00:07:24.740 --> 00:07:31.640
Well, agricultural jobs, which once were a
massive part of the American labor force,
have fallen drastically over the last century.

00:07:31.640 --> 00:07:39.460
While 40% of the labor force was involved
in the agricultural sector in 1900, only about
2% of workers today work in farming.

00:07:39.460 --> 00:07:47.540
Similarly, manufacturing jobs, which were the
lifeblood of the US economy for much of the 20th
century, have also declined in the last 30 years.

00:07:47.540 --> 00:07:52.900
So, the US economy began with many workers serving
in either the primary and secondary economic sectors,

00:07:52.900 --> 00:07:57.700
but now, much of the US economy is centered
on the tertiary sector, or the service industry.

00:07:57.700 --> 00:08:01.100
The service industry makes up 85% of
jobs in the US,

00:08:01.100 --> 00:08:08.080
including everything from administrative
assistants to nurses to teachers to lawyers to
everyone who made this Crash Course video for you.

00:08:08.080 --> 00:08:10.500
Now, that’s a really big and diverse group.

00:08:10.500 --> 00:08:14.720
That’s because the tertiary sector – like
all the economic sectors we’ve been discussing

00:08:14.720 --> 00:08:19.340
– is defined mainly by what it produces,
rather than what kinds of jobs it includes.

00:08:19.340 --> 00:08:26.020
So, sociologists have a way of distinguishing
between types of jobs, based more on the social
status and compensation that come with them:

00:08:26.020 --> 00:08:28.900
There’s the primary labor market and the
secondary labor market.

00:08:28.900 --> 00:08:36.100
The primary labor market includes jobs that provide
lots of benefits to workers, like high incomes, job
security, health insurance and retirement packages.

00:08:36.100 --> 00:08:40.060
These are white collar professions, like doctors
or accountants or engineers.

00:08:40.060 --> 00:08:45.780
Secondary labor market jobs provide fewer
benefits and include lower-skilled jobs and
lower-level service sector jobs.

00:08:45.780 --> 00:08:50.980
They tend to pay less, have more unpredictable
schedules, and typically don’t offer benefits 
like health insurance.

00:08:50.980 --> 00:08:53.100
They also tend to have less job security.

00:08:53.100 --> 00:08:55.560
So what’s next for capitalism, or socialism?

00:08:55.560 --> 00:08:59.020
Well, no one knows what the next economic
revolution is going to look like.

00:08:59.020 --> 00:09:04.120
But I can tell you that, nowadays, a key part
of both our economic and political landscape
is corporations.

00:09:04.120 --> 00:09:10.080
Corporations are defined as organizations
that exist as legal entities and have liabilities
that are separate from its members.

00:09:10.080 --> 00:09:11.700
So, they’re their own things.

00:09:11.700 --> 00:09:15.820
And more and more these days, corporations
are operating across national boundaries,

00:09:15.820 --> 00:09:22.520
which means that the future of the US economy
– and most countries’ economies – will
play out on a global scale.

00:09:22.520 --> 00:09:27.360
Today we discussed how economies can be broken
down into the primary, secondary, and tertiary sectors.

00:09:27.360 --> 00:09:31.780
We discussed the three stages of economic revolution
that brought us to the modern post-industrial era.

00:09:31.780 --> 00:09:36.620
And in the middle there, we talked about two
types of economic models: capitalism and socialism.

00:09:36.620 --> 00:09:43.040
Crash Course Sociology is filmed in the Dr.
