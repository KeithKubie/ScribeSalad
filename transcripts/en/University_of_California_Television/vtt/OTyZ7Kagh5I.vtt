00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:28.300
Hi, everybody.

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:32.150
I'm Dr. David Granet and
welcome to Health Matters.

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:34.390
It's estimated that
up to 66% of

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:37.300
the American population is
currently overweight or obese.

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:39.840
If you're not talking
about it right now,

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:41.690
you probably were
just a few minutes ago.

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:44.660
Recently, there's been a
new study that talks about

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:46.510
the influences
of the environment,

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:49.090
your friends
and your family.

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:51.300
I'm going to talk about
which is more important

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:54.180
on how you look and how
much weight you have.

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:56.420
To help us get through this,
we have the author

00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:58.510
of that study,
Dr. James Fowler,

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:00.600
who's an associate professor
of political science,

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:02.810
and we'll point out that his
doctorate is a PhD,

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:04.510
what we call a real doctor.

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:06.330
We also have
Dr. Mike Gottschalk

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:08.180
who is a professor
of pediatrics

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:09.840
and Chief or "El Jefe"

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.030
of pediatric endocrinology
here at

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:14.300
the University of California
San Diego as well.

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:16.480
We have you both
here because

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:20.090
this crosses disciplines
into effecting everyone.

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:21.870
Well, we've been
talking about it

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:23.360
before we started the show.

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:25.870
Everywhere you turn,
there is something

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:28.570
about the study
that you guys recently did

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:32.780
and it's just amazing
looking at the social network

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:34.330
and how that
can affect weight.

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:35.840
Can you give us
a quick summary?

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.510
And then we'll delve
into some of the details.

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:40.480
Sure. So we got some data

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:42.300
from the Framingham
Heart Study

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.570
which is this really
long-running study.

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:47.000
It started actually
in the late 1940s

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:49.210
and we've learned
a lot of what we know,

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:50.450
for example, about
the relationship

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:53.810
between heart disease
and smoking from this study.

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:56.240
So this study is going
on today even still.

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:59.180
And starting in the 1970s,
the study started

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:01.690
keeping records on peoples'
friends and family.

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:04.480
So we actually got
a grant to map

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:07.360
the social network
of the people in the study

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:09.090
so that we could see
who was friends with whom

00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:12.660
and what family members
people had in the study.

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:14.450
And because it was
such a small group

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:15.780
there in Framingham,

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:17.540
a lot of these people
connected up to one another

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:19.300
so that we could
see the influence

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:21.540
of one person's weight gain

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:23.030
on another person's
weight gain.

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:25.090
Well, you say small,
but it's like 12,000 people.

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:26.390
Yeah, 12,000 people.

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:28.240
What I mean by small
is it wasn't a study

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:30.480
of people all
around the country.

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:32.390
It was a single
community so that,

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:34.150
when people mentioned
who their friends were,

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:36.660
they were also likely
to be members of the study.

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:39.090
And you had information
about how much they weighed?

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:40.450
Absolutely.

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:42.360
Again, this is
a gold standard study

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:44.510
and they actually
had doctors weigh them

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:46.270
every two to four years.

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:48.690
So we looked across
the seven different exams,

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:51.750
32 years, to see what
happened as one person

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:54.240
gained weight to their
friends and to their family.

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:56.210
What we found was
really stunning.

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:57.660
We thought we would
find something,

00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:59.750
but we didn't realize
the effects would be so large.

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:02.030
We found that,
if your friend becomes obese,

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:05.180
it increases your own risk
of obesity by 57%.

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:08.270
But what if your
family member is obese?

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:11.300
Also, we found, if your
siblings become obese,

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:14.060
it increases your risk
by 40% and,

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:17.150
if your spouse becomes obese,
it increases your risk by 37%.

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:18.840
See, I'm still shocked
by that because it would

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.180
seem to me that your spouse
who you're with every day

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:24.420
would have more of an impact
on you than a friend,

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:25.510
but it was not that way.

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:26.870
It's funny you should
mention that because,

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:29.000
when we first started
doing the modeling,

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:31.030
we looked at that result
and we thought nobody

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:32.330
is going to believe this.

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:34.450
You know, my wife, she
has less influence on me?

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:36.450
I mean, heck,
my wife makes the meals.

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:37.540
That's right, that's right.

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:39.180
Sometimes the husbands
make the meals,

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:41.330
but spouses, they spend
a lot of time together.

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:43.390
So we looked more carefully
at the friendship data

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:45.240
and the sibling data
and what we found

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:47.780
in that data is
that same-sex relations

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:50.450
were much more important
than opposite sex relations.

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:52.270
So men apparently
looked to men

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:53.750
and women looked
to other women

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:56.510
more than to members
of the opposite sex.

00:03:56.570 --> 00:03:59.510
So while spouses spend
a lot of time together

00:03:59.570 --> 00:04:01.360
and on average are
really good friends

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:04.060
with one another, they're also
members of the opposite sex.

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:06.420
So those two factors will
work against one another.

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:08.000
And my wife told me
that many years ago,

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:10.000
that she doesn't dress
for me or the other men.

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:11.150
She's dressing
for the women

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:13.090
because they all look
at each other.

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:15.570
So it made sense
to me because

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:17.420
I've been educated on
that aspect already.

00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:19.870
Now when you heard
the results of this

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:22.600
as a clinician
dealing with weight issues,

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:25.240
especially in children,
were you surprised

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:27.240
or did you expect
the family relationships

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:28.690
to be more important?

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:31.060
Well, I think, with children,
we're in a little bit more

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:32.750
of a unique situation
because the parents

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:34.480
and the family have
a tremendous influence

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:35.540
on the child.

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:37.030
For example, the parents
buy the food,

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:38.540
the child has some
access to it.

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:39.600
So some of
the decision-making

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:41.150
that goes on in terms
of lifestyles

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:43.420
are really controlled
still by parents.

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:45.540
But we were surprised
because I think

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:47.600
this is a novel paradigm
that really

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:49.120
hasn't been explored before.

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:51.090
And as we're trying
to go forward

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:52.660
and trying to prevent obesity,

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:55.270
as well as potentially
come up with regiments

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:57.330
to treat obesity,
you really have to understand

00:04:57.390 --> 00:04:59.180
what are all
the variables in terms

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:01.240
of barriers and
what's driving this.

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:03.030
If we don't
understand that,

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:04.570
then no matter what
we come up with a scheme,

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:06.210
we're not going to be
very successful with.

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:09.180
I mean, some of the
impacts on this,

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:10.450
I was thinking
about as a physician

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:13.060
on trying to impact
someone to get them

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:14.540
to start an exercise program
or something.

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:16.630
One of the things
that was, I think,

00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:18.150
the most powerful effect
in this study

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:20.870
that you wrote was that,
if two people said

00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:23.480
each other were friends,
the number skyrocketed

00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:24.660
on the effect.

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:26.000
Absolutely. So these forms

00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:27.510
that we collected
the information from

00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:29.630
asked people
to name a close friend

00:05:29.690 --> 00:05:32.720
who would know where you lived
two to four years from now.

00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:35.660
So we had three different
kinds of relationships.

00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:37.630
So I could name
you as a friend

00:05:37.690 --> 00:05:40.840
so we could see your effect
on me or my effect on you,

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.660
or we could both name
each other as a friend.

00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:46.390
It makes sense that, if we
name each other as a friend,

00:05:46.450 --> 00:05:48.840
that that's probably evidence
of a stronger relationship

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.570
and we found there a much,
much stronger influence

00:05:51.630 --> 00:05:54.060
between mutual friends
than between friends

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:56.720
where only one person
named the other person.

00:05:56.780 --> 00:05:58.240
The other really
interesting thing,

00:05:58.300 --> 00:06:00.480
in these association
studies,

00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:02.570
we really have
evidence of causality,

00:06:02.630 --> 00:06:03.870
but what we found was,

00:06:04.030 --> 00:06:06.300
if I name you as a friend
and you become obese,

00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:08.300
it increases
my risk of obesity,

00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:10.000
but not the other way around.

00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:13.210
So this is just an effect
of people that we esteem,

00:06:13.270 --> 00:06:15.060
people that
we name as friends.

00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:16.480
You may be sort
of blissfully unaware

00:06:16.540 --> 00:06:19.240
of my existence if I name
you as a friend, right?

00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:20.750
Then I'm not going
to have an impact on you.

00:06:20.810 --> 00:06:22.390
So the fact that
the influence seemed

00:06:22.450 --> 00:06:25.120
to flow in one direction is,
we think,

00:06:25.180 --> 00:06:26.690
really strong
evidence of causality.

00:06:26.750 --> 00:06:28.180
Which is amazing.

00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:29.330
Again, going back
to the actual

00:06:29.390 --> 00:06:32.690
now putting that into effect,
I'm thinking about trying

00:06:32.750 --> 00:06:35.270
to change someone's behavior

00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:37.600
and you're talking
to them in the office,

00:06:37.660 --> 00:06:39.120
but their friend's obese

00:06:39.180 --> 00:06:41.540
and the friend's not
sitting there with you

00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:43.390
and that friend has
a very powerful effect.

00:06:43.450 --> 00:06:46.090
It almost changes
the paradigm.

00:06:46.150 --> 00:06:49.180
It does, and I think
we were talking before.

00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:54.510
One of the questions comes
is how does influence occur?

00:06:54.570 --> 00:06:57.360
Is it that the person
is looking for acceptance

00:06:57.420 --> 00:06:59.030
of the change
in their weight,

00:06:59.090 --> 00:07:00.360
and they're going
to be satisfied

00:07:00.420 --> 00:07:02.030
with the fact that
they're gaining weight

00:07:02.090 --> 00:07:03.720
and not want to make a change?

00:07:03.780 --> 00:07:06.060
If their friends,
though, perceive that

00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:07.720
that's not what
should be happening,

00:07:07.780 --> 00:07:09.870
then trying to get them
to influence the change

00:07:10.030 --> 00:07:11.270
is going to be
really important.

00:07:11.330 --> 00:07:14.270
So it becomes difficult,
though, because you can't

00:07:14.330 --> 00:07:16.660
get friends over distances
to maybe go to the gym

00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:18.810
unless they have a webcam
and they can show each other

00:07:18.870 --> 00:07:21.390
exercising at the same time.

00:07:21.450 --> 00:07:23.150
But I think there
are other strategies

00:07:23.210 --> 00:07:26.330
that you can involve within
sort of local friends

00:07:26.390 --> 00:07:27.630
and close friends

00:07:27.690 --> 00:07:28.780
and sometimes it's
already been done

00:07:28.840 --> 00:07:30.630
because you look at--
there's a TV show

00:07:30.690 --> 00:07:31.870
in which they try to get
everybody to lose weight

00:07:32.030 --> 00:07:34.090
at the same time and they
make it a competition.

00:07:34.150 --> 00:07:37.300
There are organizations
where, you know, at work,

00:07:37.360 --> 00:07:41.120
they said, okay, as a group,
we're going to lose 80 pounds,

00:07:41.180 --> 00:07:42.600
so I think there's
a very social networking

00:07:42.660 --> 00:07:44.180
going on and that's
how this sort of

00:07:44.240 --> 00:07:46.360
pull and tug that you can
bring people along together

00:07:46.420 --> 00:07:48.660
and maybe more effective
than trying to just look

00:07:48.720 --> 00:07:50.180
at individuals in isolation.

00:07:50.240 --> 00:07:51.240
Absolutely.

00:07:51.300 --> 00:07:52.300
Well, that's an interesting
way to discuss

00:07:52.360 --> 00:07:54.720
even spending money from
a public health standpoint

00:07:54.780 --> 00:07:57.360
is influencing the social
network at a workplace

00:07:57.420 --> 00:07:58.810
rather than the individual
in front of you.

00:07:58.870 --> 00:08:01.600
Absolutely, and another
interesting thing

00:08:01.660 --> 00:08:03.420
about the study,
because we have these maps

00:08:03.480 --> 00:08:05.780
of the social network,
we not only knew

00:08:05.840 --> 00:08:07.450
what was happening
between friends,

00:08:07.510 --> 00:08:09.090
but between friends' friends.

00:08:09.150 --> 00:08:10.630
So you may have a friend
and I don't know

00:08:10.690 --> 00:08:13.330
that person and, if you
and I are close friends,

00:08:13.390 --> 00:08:15.240
that person's weight
also affects my weight.

00:08:15.300 --> 00:08:18.840
In fact, it extends to your
friends' friends' friends,

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:21.390
three degrees of separation
into the network.

00:08:21.450 --> 00:08:23.150
So people that
you've never met,

00:08:23.210 --> 00:08:24.630
you have an influence
on them

00:08:24.690 --> 00:08:26.240
and they have
an influence on you.

00:08:26.300 --> 00:08:29.420
Somehow whenever I drop my son
off at elementary school,

00:08:29.480 --> 00:08:32.780
there are all these people who
are in their workout clothes.

00:08:32.840 --> 00:08:37.210
You start to see--I looked
at the world differently

00:08:37.270 --> 00:08:39.240
after reading your report and
looking at these influences

00:08:39.300 --> 00:08:41.690
that are all around us
of who we respect

00:08:41.750 --> 00:08:44.270
and who we are friends
with and what they look like

00:08:44.330 --> 00:08:46.360
in a way that I never
would have before,

00:08:46.420 --> 00:08:48.360
especially in
the application to medicine.

00:08:48.420 --> 00:08:50.870
I still find it amazing
what you found.

00:08:51.030 --> 00:08:54.330
Though it's interesting
because we found the what,

00:08:54.390 --> 00:08:56.420
but we still don't
know the why, right?

00:08:56.480 --> 00:08:58.810
So there's is this association
that does appear

00:08:58.870 --> 00:09:01.120
to flow in one direction,
but why is the case?

00:09:01.180 --> 00:09:04.630
Is it because of acceptance of
larger body sizes over time?

00:09:04.690 --> 00:09:08.090
Is it because of shared
norms about eating,

00:09:08.150 --> 00:09:10.090
shared norms about exercise?

00:09:10.150 --> 00:09:12.270
Those are things that
we really need to explore

00:09:12.330 --> 00:09:14.660
in order to be able
to give better advice

00:09:14.720 --> 00:09:17.360
on what these
interventions should be

00:09:17.420 --> 00:09:18.870
when you get your friends
and family involved

00:09:19.030 --> 00:09:21.180
in your own health behaviors.

00:09:21.240 --> 00:09:23.510
And we clearly
want to start this early.

00:09:23.570 --> 00:09:25.480
I mean, we want people
to have good behavior early.

00:09:25.540 --> 00:09:27.720
You're involved
with the PACE program.

00:09:27.780 --> 00:09:28.870
Correct.

00:09:29.030 --> 00:09:30.300
Could you tell us
a little bit about that?

00:09:30.360 --> 00:09:33.210
So this is a study trying
to make changes in lifestyle

00:09:33.270 --> 00:09:36.510
both in respect
to eating and exercising.

00:09:36.570 --> 00:09:38.600
We're working with children
who are at risk

00:09:38.660 --> 00:09:40.180
for developing
Type 2 diabetes.

00:09:40.240 --> 00:09:41.840
So they're overweight,
they may have

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:44.120
a strong history
of Type 2 diabetes

00:09:44.180 --> 00:09:46.090
in their family, usually
there are certain

00:09:46.150 --> 00:09:47.840
ethnic minorities
such as African Americans,

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:51.000
Hispanics in this community,
Asian Americans.

00:09:51.060 --> 00:09:53.810
What we want to do
to see if through

00:09:53.870 --> 00:09:57.000
behavior modification,
but hook the adolescent

00:09:57.060 --> 00:09:59.000
to something that
they use commonly,

00:09:59.060 --> 00:10:01.120
and that's the Internet
or cell phones.

00:10:01.180 --> 00:10:05.510
So the idea is that they go to
a website on a weekly basis,

00:10:05.570 --> 00:10:07.480
they log in and they
have been asked

00:10:07.540 --> 00:10:09.780
to select goals that
they're going to make

00:10:09.840 --> 00:10:11.420
in terms of diet
and exercise.

00:10:11.480 --> 00:10:13.750
For diet, we use what's called
the Stoplight Diet

00:10:13.810 --> 00:10:16.210
so foods are broken down
into reds, yellows and greens,

00:10:16.270 --> 00:10:17.270
not the color of the food,

00:10:17.330 --> 00:10:19.180
but these are
not healthy foods,

00:10:19.240 --> 00:10:20.660
these are better selections...

00:10:20.720 --> 00:10:22.780
The different curries.

00:10:24.240 --> 00:10:26.150
So even though peas are green,

00:10:26.210 --> 00:10:29.840
we won't get a lot of kids
going to that direction.

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:33.600
And what we'd like to see is,
when they enter the study,

00:10:33.660 --> 00:10:36.000
we take inventory of
what their typical diet is

00:10:36.060 --> 00:10:38.300
and their selections and
their preferences and then,

00:10:38.360 --> 00:10:39.780
at the end of the year,
to see if we can shift

00:10:39.840 --> 00:10:43.210
from more out of the reds
more toward the yellows

00:10:43.270 --> 00:10:44.630
and greens and,
conversely,

00:10:44.690 --> 00:10:47.210
trying to get them to increase
their daily physical activity.

00:10:47.270 --> 00:10:48.810
So they wear pedometers
which keeps track

00:10:48.870 --> 00:10:51.180
of how many steps
they're taking,

00:10:51.240 --> 00:10:53.690
and the goal is over time
at the increased amount

00:10:53.750 --> 00:10:55.210
of physical activity.

00:10:55.270 --> 00:10:58.810
So the behavioral part
comes in is that they go on,

00:10:58.870 --> 00:11:00.450
they log onto a website,
they can see.

00:11:00.510 --> 00:11:02.090
They select their goals.

00:11:02.150 --> 00:11:03.180
It's not that
we're prescribing

00:11:03.240 --> 00:11:04.360
what they have to do.

00:11:04.420 --> 00:11:05.630
They have choices to make
based on what

00:11:05.690 --> 00:11:07.720
their preferences are,
which I think is really

00:11:07.780 --> 00:11:09.390
the only way that
you're going to affect

00:11:09.450 --> 00:11:11.210
change in the individual.

00:11:11.270 --> 00:11:14.720
And then they get feedback
because they see the changes

00:11:14.780 --> 00:11:16.480
they made over each week,
they get rewards.

00:11:16.540 --> 00:11:18.030
We use a lot
of music downloads

00:11:18.090 --> 00:11:19.390
because we're dealing
with adolescents.

00:11:19.450 --> 00:11:21.150
This is social networking.

00:11:21.210 --> 00:11:22.240
Do they get to talk
to other kids

00:11:22.300 --> 00:11:23.540
who are living through this
at the same time?

00:11:23.600 --> 00:11:25.630
One of the arms is,

00:11:25.690 --> 00:11:28.300
not only do they have
this internet access,

00:11:28.360 --> 00:11:31.030
but they come back for
sessions with other kids

00:11:31.090 --> 00:11:33.090
within that same group,
so they interact.

00:11:33.150 --> 00:11:34.510
And we bring parents, too,
so the parents

00:11:34.570 --> 00:11:36.120
have a piece of this as well.

00:11:36.180 --> 00:11:38.150
This, again, goes back
to influences and,

00:11:38.210 --> 00:11:40.720
certainly from my
own clinical experience,

00:11:40.780 --> 00:11:43.540
I think the children that are
most successful losing weight

00:11:43.600 --> 00:11:46.150
is when we get the parents to
lose weight at the same time.

00:11:46.210 --> 00:11:47.390
Because if the parents
see changes

00:11:47.450 --> 00:11:48.750
and they're feeling better
about themselves,

00:11:48.810 --> 00:11:50.540
then they're going
to just pull that kid

00:11:50.600 --> 00:11:52.450
out the door with them and
go for a walk with the dog.

00:11:52.510 --> 00:11:54.780
That's how that's how
they effect change.

00:11:54.840 --> 00:11:56.420
So when the groups
come back together,

00:11:56.480 --> 00:11:58.690
it's been very
interesting to see

00:11:58.750 --> 00:12:00.540
because they share
their experiences

00:12:00.600 --> 00:12:02.000
and see what's
successful for them,

00:12:02.060 --> 00:12:03.090
what's worked for them,
what hasn't,

00:12:03.150 --> 00:12:05.030
what are their challenges,
what obstacles

00:12:05.090 --> 00:12:07.660
do they still have and how
do they perceive themselves.

00:12:07.720 --> 00:12:09.570
You started this program
before the study

00:12:09.630 --> 00:12:12.240
that Dr. Fowler had done
and came out,

00:12:12.300 --> 00:12:14.840
but you were hitting on
the same sort of principles

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:16.690
of the influences.

00:12:16.750 --> 00:12:19.780
I think the influences
in his study

00:12:19.840 --> 00:12:23.030
are even different
than what we considered

00:12:23.090 --> 00:12:24.120
typical influences

00:12:24.180 --> 00:12:26.090
because I think
certainly with adolescence,

00:12:26.150 --> 00:12:27.480
peers are very important.

00:12:27.540 --> 00:12:29.150
You know, this is a time
where they're moving away

00:12:29.210 --> 00:12:32.600
from their parents and trying
to develop independence,

00:12:32.660 --> 00:12:37.030
so their peer network
is really important.

00:12:37.090 --> 00:12:39.330
It may not always be,
though, that they consider

00:12:39.390 --> 00:12:41.480
all their peers are
sort of their best friends,

00:12:41.540 --> 00:12:43.360
but they survive under
this peer pressure.

00:12:43.420 --> 00:12:45.360
That's a little bit
different than I think

00:12:45.420 --> 00:12:49.150
what you're describing,
but certainly this has

00:12:49.210 --> 00:12:50.660
to also exist
for the adolescents

00:12:50.720 --> 00:12:53.300
as well and it's important
to realize that

00:12:53.360 --> 00:12:55.330
so we can tap into that and
use that to our advantage.

00:12:55.390 --> 00:12:56.630
When I was reading
about the PACE program,

00:12:56.690 --> 00:12:59.540
one of the things that hit me
was that the obese adolescent

00:12:59.600 --> 00:13:01.750
may become antisocial
or isolated

00:13:01.810 --> 00:13:04.060
and then their
social network is reduced

00:13:04.120 --> 00:13:06.600
to their family, which
becomes their influence.

00:13:06.660 --> 00:13:08.660
Then I started thinking,
well, getting their parents

00:13:08.720 --> 00:13:10.030
to lose weight
is obviously important,

00:13:10.090 --> 00:13:11.810
but their parents aren't
going to lose weight

00:13:11.870 --> 00:13:13.000
unless they have a friend
whose influence--

00:13:13.060 --> 00:13:14.690
You know, you start trying
to do those dominoes

00:13:14.750 --> 00:13:17.480
and making them fall, of
trying to impact all that,

00:13:17.540 --> 00:13:19.810
you got this kid that
you're trying to help

00:13:19.870 --> 00:13:21.510
who's at risk for diabetes

00:13:21.570 --> 00:13:22.780
and you want to get
the parents to go,

00:13:22.840 --> 00:13:23.840
but the parents
are going out

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:25.450
for barbecue every night
with their social group

00:13:25.510 --> 00:13:26.780
that plays cards
together or something.

00:13:26.840 --> 00:13:29.690
How do you make those
changes and it starts

00:13:29.750 --> 00:13:31.540
to become a pretty big issue.

00:13:31.600 --> 00:13:33.030
I just want
to emphasize something

00:13:33.090 --> 00:13:34.330
about this particular issue.

00:13:34.390 --> 00:13:37.030
It certainly is the case
that obesity is associated

00:13:37.090 --> 00:13:39.750
with social isolation and
a lot of people, I think,

00:13:39.810 --> 00:13:43.000
interpreted the results
of our study to be that,

00:13:43.060 --> 00:13:44.720
if you have a friend
who becomes obese,

00:13:44.780 --> 00:13:46.570
that you should stop
being friends with them.

00:13:46.630 --> 00:13:48.870
That's not at all
the message of our study.

00:13:49.030 --> 00:13:51.510
We studied existing
friendships, right?

00:13:51.570 --> 00:13:52.720
So there's nothing
that you can infer

00:13:52.780 --> 00:13:54.150
from our study about,
you know,

00:13:54.210 --> 00:13:57.030
getting rid of your friend
or getting a new friend

00:13:57.090 --> 00:13:58.240
who might have healthy
eating behaviors.

00:13:58.300 --> 00:13:59.690
We looked at the
existing network,

00:13:59.750 --> 00:14:02.510
but there's this huge
literature on social support

00:14:02.570 --> 00:14:04.780
that shows that,
when you have more friends,

00:14:04.840 --> 00:14:06.030
you're healthier.

00:14:06.090 --> 00:14:08.480
You get more support, you
feel better about yourself.

00:14:08.540 --> 00:14:10.390
There's sort of a number
of causal mechanisms

00:14:10.450 --> 00:14:12.630
that cause us to
become healthier

00:14:12.690 --> 00:14:13.870
when we have more friends.

00:14:14.030 --> 00:14:17.210
There was so much
kind of controversy

00:14:17.270 --> 00:14:18.720
on this point
with the study

00:14:18.780 --> 00:14:20.840
that I actually went
back to our data

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:22.180
and looked to see
what happened to people

00:14:22.240 --> 00:14:24.420
who got rid of friends
once they became obese.

00:14:24.480 --> 00:14:27.360
So you actually had the data
so that, if their friend

00:14:27.420 --> 00:14:28.720
changed weight
and gained weight

00:14:28.780 --> 00:14:31.090
and then you looked back
the next visit

00:14:31.150 --> 00:14:32.150
and they're no
longer friends...

00:14:32.210 --> 00:14:33.360
- That's right.
- What happens to them?

00:14:33.420 --> 00:14:35.720
It increases the risk
of obesity, yes.

00:14:35.780 --> 00:14:38.720
So getting rid of the friend
actually increased their risk.

00:14:38.780 --> 00:14:39.810
That's right.

00:14:39.870 --> 00:14:41.300
So on balance, you may
gain something

00:14:41.360 --> 00:14:44.030
from having a set of
friends who are engaged

00:14:44.090 --> 00:14:45.840
in healthy behaviors,
but what you lose

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:48.420
from losing the friend
is actually much worse.

00:14:48.480 --> 00:14:51.210
So the last message
you should take

00:14:51.270 --> 00:14:53.570
from this study is
to get rid of any friend.

00:14:53.630 --> 00:14:55.870
So the best message
might be you

00:14:56.030 --> 00:14:57.360
and your friend together
lose weight.

00:14:57.420 --> 00:15:00.360
Absolutely, and I think
that a lot of people

00:15:00.420 --> 00:15:01.660
already understood
this, right?

00:15:01.720 --> 00:15:03.660
I mean, some people
reacted to the study,

00:15:03.720 --> 00:15:05.870
oh, that's really neat,
and others reacted, well, duh.

00:15:06.030 --> 00:15:08.150
I knew that the best way
for me to be able

00:15:08.210 --> 00:15:10.720
to change my own behaviors
is to get my friends

00:15:10.780 --> 00:15:12.030
and family involved.

00:15:12.090 --> 00:15:13.570
I mean, you have
WeightWatchers.

00:15:13.630 --> 00:15:15.270
In other domains, you
have Alcoholics Anonymous.

00:15:15.330 --> 00:15:17.540
These are groups that
have already understood

00:15:17.600 --> 00:15:20.270
very well that social networks
are really the core

00:15:20.330 --> 00:15:22.600
for a successful change
in your lifestyle.

00:15:22.660 --> 00:15:24.780
But no one had looked at it
quite like you had before.

00:15:24.840 --> 00:15:26.270
We just didn't
have the data before.

00:15:26.330 --> 00:15:29.090
Now we have the data and we can
really confirm our intuitions.

00:15:29.150 --> 00:15:32.360
So there are a lot of people
who spend time watching TV.

00:15:32.420 --> 00:15:34.690
Often adolescents
fall into that category.

00:15:34.750 --> 00:15:36.840
There are role models
that fall into TV.

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:41.450
There are from MTV videos to
people we see on television.

00:15:41.510 --> 00:15:46.300
How do we fit that impact
into what the social norm is

00:15:46.360 --> 00:15:47.600
or behavior for people?

00:15:47.660 --> 00:15:49.030
It's not your friend?

00:15:49.090 --> 00:15:51.420
I think that people sort of
think about them that way,

00:15:51.480 --> 00:15:52.720
but they're not truly friends.

00:15:52.780 --> 00:15:55.150
Where does that fit, a role of
television playing in weight?

00:15:55.210 --> 00:15:57.780
Good question.

00:15:57.840 --> 00:16:00.690
One of the things that our
study really indicates

00:16:00.750 --> 00:16:02.450
is that you have to be
very good friends

00:16:02.510 --> 00:16:05.060
with somebody in order
for there to be an effect.

00:16:05.120 --> 00:16:06.630
So, for example,
we looked at the effect

00:16:06.690 --> 00:16:09.030
of immediate neighbors
and there was no effect.

00:16:09.090 --> 00:16:11.690
So that can be someone that
you actually see frequently,

00:16:11.750 --> 00:16:14.030
but you're not necessarily
very close to them.

00:16:14.090 --> 00:16:15.540
And if they become obese,
it has absolutely

00:16:15.600 --> 00:16:16.870
no impact on you.

00:16:17.030 --> 00:16:18.720
Also, the sort
of the stronger...

00:16:18.780 --> 00:16:19.810
So if my neighbors are
listening, they can...

00:16:19.870 --> 00:16:22.360
That's right, so they can go
ahead and eat the extra steak.

00:16:22.420 --> 00:16:24.210
They can breath easy.

00:16:24.270 --> 00:16:27.480
But the idea is that
this has to be someone

00:16:27.540 --> 00:16:28.780
that you're very close to,

00:16:28.840 --> 00:16:30.510
close friends,
close family members.

00:16:30.570 --> 00:16:34.780
So the idea
that television watching

00:16:34.840 --> 00:16:38.120
or sort of these
relationships on the Internet

00:16:38.180 --> 00:16:39.480
are going to influence this.

00:16:39.540 --> 00:16:43.150
You know, seeing models on TV
or the thousands of people

00:16:43.210 --> 00:16:45.150
you're connected to
in Facebook,

00:16:45.210 --> 00:16:46.690
those people are
not going to matter.

00:16:46.750 --> 00:16:47.750
The people that are
going to matter

00:16:47.810 --> 00:16:49.000
are going to be the people
that you're deeply

00:16:49.060 --> 00:16:50.540
and closely socially
connected to.

00:16:50.600 --> 00:16:54.060
Can you compare that effect
to other effects?

00:16:54.120 --> 00:16:58.090
In other words, eating habits,
activity of lifestyle.

00:16:58.150 --> 00:17:03.540
Is it all tied in or is this
just one piece of the puzzle?

00:17:03.600 --> 00:17:05.090
We certainly expected them
to be tied.

00:17:05.150 --> 00:17:07.030
Actually, you might know
a little bit more about this

00:17:07.090 --> 00:17:08.570
than we do because
we've really just tried

00:17:08.630 --> 00:17:12.090
to state what the association
is between

00:17:12.150 --> 00:17:13.390
different individual's weight.

00:17:13.450 --> 00:17:15.780
I do know that the next thing
we're going to be studying

00:17:15.840 --> 00:17:18.840
is what foods people
are eating in this network.

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:20.840
So we just got a grant
to do this

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:23.000
and they took a food
frequency questionnaire

00:17:23.060 --> 00:17:24.300
where they asked
detailed questions

00:17:24.360 --> 00:17:25.840
about what people ate.

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:27.840
So just as a tongue
in cheek example,

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:29.870
we drew the banana-eating
network.

00:17:30.030 --> 00:17:32.270
How many bananas
do you eat a week?

00:17:32.330 --> 00:17:34.180
But this is going
to obviously feed into--

00:17:34.240 --> 00:17:35.660
you know, we can categorize
these foods as green,

00:17:35.720 --> 00:17:36.720
yellow and red.

00:17:36.780 --> 00:17:39.240
I can imagine green circles,
yellow circles and red circles

00:17:39.300 --> 00:17:40.720
all sort of connected
to each other

00:17:40.780 --> 00:17:43.120
and you can see the extent
to which good eating behavior

00:17:43.180 --> 00:17:44.810
or bad eating behavior flows

00:17:44.870 --> 00:17:47.000
and how it's related
to obesity.

00:17:47.060 --> 00:17:49.210
And you probably predict
that those food color networks

00:17:49.270 --> 00:17:50.870
would match up with
the friendship networks

00:17:51.030 --> 00:17:53.570
and obesity.
I mean, they overlap.

00:17:53.630 --> 00:17:54.810
That's certainly
what we expect,

00:17:54.870 --> 00:17:56.480
but that work
has yet to be done.

00:17:56.540 --> 00:17:58.360
And it goes together with
what you're trying to do

00:17:58.420 --> 00:17:59.690
with PACE and the other
work that you do

00:17:59.750 --> 00:18:01.360
trying to change
that behavior

00:18:01.420 --> 00:18:03.660
and where to get
the levering to do it.

00:18:03.720 --> 00:18:06.780
I think what's
interesting about this study,

00:18:06.840 --> 00:18:08.420
again, is that these
sort of transitioned

00:18:08.480 --> 00:18:10.570
over distances and,
like you said,

00:18:10.630 --> 00:18:12.870
you can be three or
persons removed.

00:18:13.030 --> 00:18:14.810
So it's a little
difficult to imagine

00:18:14.870 --> 00:18:17.540
that it's going to be
just how you eat

00:18:17.600 --> 00:18:19.420
because how would
that fourth person

00:18:19.480 --> 00:18:21.600
really know how the
first person is eating?

00:18:21.660 --> 00:18:23.300
It's sort of like
the old telephone game

00:18:23.360 --> 00:18:25.000
when we were younger kids
and your whispered message

00:18:25.060 --> 00:18:26.540
was totally different
at the end.

00:18:26.600 --> 00:18:27.810
Right.

00:18:27.870 --> 00:18:29.030
So as you start moving
down the links,

00:18:29.090 --> 00:18:31.210
I think you start
to lose some of the effect

00:18:31.270 --> 00:18:32.570
- and some influence.
- Absolutely.

00:18:32.630 --> 00:18:34.780
But I think it still
goes back more to,

00:18:34.840 --> 00:18:37.210
as you talked about,
friendships and how people

00:18:37.270 --> 00:18:39.420
perceive each other
and acceptance

00:18:39.480 --> 00:18:41.000
of their perception.

00:18:41.060 --> 00:18:42.750
My wife's a runner,
so she's friends

00:18:42.810 --> 00:18:44.330
with other people
who run who are friends

00:18:44.390 --> 00:18:45.390
with other people who run

00:18:45.450 --> 00:18:47.480
and that's the way
I looked at it,

00:18:47.540 --> 00:18:48.720
that they have
common interests

00:18:48.780 --> 00:18:50.510
that lead them
in certain directions.

00:18:50.570 --> 00:18:52.150
We'll see how it holds up.

00:18:52.210 --> 00:18:53.420
That's probably true.

00:18:53.480 --> 00:18:56.030
I should emphasize the fact
that the effect gets smaller

00:18:56.090 --> 00:18:57.090
as you get further away.

00:18:57.150 --> 00:18:58.210
So by the time
you're four degrees removed,

00:18:58.270 --> 00:18:59.450
there's not
an effect, right?

00:18:59.510 --> 00:19:00.570
So the strongest ones
are the ones

00:19:00.630 --> 00:19:01.750
we're directly connected to.

00:19:01.810 --> 00:19:03.060
So it is like
the game of telephone.

00:19:03.120 --> 00:19:05.300
Eventually, you know,
it's noise.

00:19:05.360 --> 00:19:06.840
I had a couple of myths
that I made sure

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:08.300
I wanted to ask you
and you answered

00:19:08.360 --> 00:19:09.360
two of them already.

00:19:09.420 --> 00:19:11.600
The third one I had was,
is obesity contagious?

00:19:11.660 --> 00:19:13.780
Is it infectious?

00:19:13.840 --> 00:19:18.000
Or is the idea of obesity
what goes on?

00:19:18.060 --> 00:19:20.810
Is there a virus that they're
spreading amongst friends?

00:19:20.870 --> 00:19:22.480
I think the ideas
are infectious.

00:19:22.540 --> 00:19:24.810
So we think
this is about norms.

00:19:24.870 --> 00:19:27.090
One of the aspects of the study
that was really interesting

00:19:27.150 --> 00:19:29.120
is that, when
we looked at friends

00:19:29.180 --> 00:19:30.840
who were thousands
of miles away

00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:32.750
versus friends
who lived very close,

00:19:32.810 --> 00:19:36.300
the effect was pretty
much the same size.

00:19:36.360 --> 00:19:39.090
So this indicates
that it's not

00:19:39.150 --> 00:19:41.210
because we're going
running with a friend

00:19:41.270 --> 00:19:42.750
or we're eating
with a friend.

00:19:42.810 --> 00:19:46.450
These are really
about us exchanging ideas

00:19:46.510 --> 00:19:49.000
about what healthy eating
and healthy exercise behavior

00:19:49.060 --> 00:19:51.360
is and what
a healthy lifestyle is.

00:19:51.420 --> 00:19:53.390
I mean, these are people that
you could see once a year

00:19:53.450 --> 00:19:54.870
and they still have
a tremendous effect

00:19:55.030 --> 00:19:56.690
on who you are.

00:19:56.750 --> 00:20:02.540
It's very impressive when
we talk about it this way.

00:20:02.600 --> 00:20:04.810
He's getting grants
to do all this.

00:20:04.870 --> 00:20:06.480
He's getting a lot
of money to do all this.

00:20:06.540 --> 00:20:09.630
How important is it that we
talk about obesity and weight?

00:20:09.690 --> 00:20:13.180
Well, it's tremendous
because the change

00:20:13.240 --> 00:20:15.150
in the prevalence of obesity
has just been staggering

00:20:15.210 --> 00:20:16.630
in the United States.

00:20:16.690 --> 00:20:18.390
The prevalence has
doubled to tripled

00:20:18.450 --> 00:20:20.090
in certain populations.

00:20:20.150 --> 00:20:23.000
Certainly, adults now, 60%,
over two-thirds,

00:20:23.060 --> 00:20:24.780
people are considered
to be overweight

00:20:24.840 --> 00:20:26.690
and a third are obese
and the children's prevalence

00:20:26.750 --> 00:20:28.540
are just trailing behind

00:20:28.600 --> 00:20:31.120
at just about
a decade beyond that.

00:20:31.180 --> 00:20:34.330
As you're well aware,
there are so many

00:20:34.390 --> 00:20:35.660
medical complications
to obesity

00:20:35.720 --> 00:20:38.600
starting from developing
insulin resistance

00:20:38.660 --> 00:20:41.390
and causing potentially the
increase of Type 2 diabetes.

00:20:41.450 --> 00:20:43.240
As an pediatric
endocrinologist,

00:20:43.300 --> 00:20:44.300
when I started 17 years ago,

00:20:44.360 --> 00:20:46.240
I never saw a child
with Type 2

00:20:46.300 --> 00:20:47.780
which we typically
associate with adults.

00:20:47.840 --> 00:20:51.360
Now 25% of the children
we see with new onset

00:20:51.420 --> 00:20:52.750
have Type 2 diabetes.

00:20:52.810 --> 00:20:55.000
And that's really
related to weight?

00:20:55.060 --> 00:20:56.240
It's really related
to weight because

00:20:56.300 --> 00:20:59.810
this has changed too rapidly
to be a genetic influence.

00:20:59.870 --> 00:21:02.600
It's clearly an environmental
influence in change.

00:21:02.660 --> 00:21:04.630
It's estimated right now,
for example,

00:21:04.690 --> 00:21:06.510
that every child
that's born today,

00:21:06.570 --> 00:21:08.300
if the prevalence
of obesity continues

00:21:08.360 --> 00:21:09.780
at its current
escalating rate,

00:21:09.840 --> 00:21:11.120
that a third
of those individuals

00:21:11.180 --> 00:21:12.750
will develop diabetes by
the time they're adults.

00:21:12.810 --> 00:21:14.060
Wow. A third?

00:21:14.120 --> 00:21:18.660
A third, so there are
quite staggering figures.

00:21:18.720 --> 00:21:20.120
Not only do we see
within the terms

00:21:20.180 --> 00:21:21.480
of the realm of diabetes,
but children

00:21:21.540 --> 00:21:24.390
are developing a disease
or fatty infiltration

00:21:24.450 --> 00:21:25.780
of the liver and
that can actually go on

00:21:25.840 --> 00:21:27.210
and develop cirrhosis,

00:21:27.270 --> 00:21:28.570
so there's a much
higher prevalence

00:21:28.630 --> 00:21:29.810
of this disorder now.

00:21:29.870 --> 00:21:32.600
We see a lot of orthopedic
problems because of obesity.

00:21:32.660 --> 00:21:35.690
Sleep apnea is another
significant problem

00:21:35.750 --> 00:21:37.270
that we're seeing,

00:21:37.330 --> 00:21:40.330
and this is being parlayed
into the adult world as well.

00:21:40.390 --> 00:21:42.390
Now you're doing some
other work on smoking

00:21:42.450 --> 00:21:45.630
and drinking and happiness?

00:21:45.690 --> 00:21:48.240
Yeah, yeah, so smoking,
we just submitted a paper

00:21:48.300 --> 00:21:49.330
and one of
the interesting things

00:21:49.390 --> 00:21:52.600
there is you can look at
the cluster sizes of smokers.

00:21:52.660 --> 00:21:53.720
So how many smokers
are sort of

00:21:53.780 --> 00:21:55.240
connected to each other?

00:21:55.300 --> 00:21:57.840
The incidence of smoking
has dramatically decreased

00:21:58.000 --> 00:21:59.540
over the last 30 years,
so in some sense,

00:21:59.600 --> 00:22:01.780
it's sort of the mirror image
of the obesity epidemic.

00:22:01.840 --> 00:22:04.210
But the size of these clusters
has remained the same,

00:22:04.270 --> 00:22:05.540
the average size.

00:22:05.600 --> 00:22:07.120
What that means,
if those two things

00:22:07.180 --> 00:22:09.210
are happening at once,
is that whole groups

00:22:09.270 --> 00:22:11.330
of people are
quitting together.

00:22:11.390 --> 00:22:13.570
So this is sort of the main
sort of interesting point.

00:22:13.630 --> 00:22:15.420
It's not people sort
of at the edge

00:22:15.480 --> 00:22:17.270
of a social network
that are quitting.

00:22:17.330 --> 00:22:18.570
It's whole groups of people.

00:22:18.630 --> 00:22:19.630
One person quits,
then everybody

00:22:19.690 --> 00:22:20.810
in the group quits.

00:22:20.870 --> 00:22:22.780
But that's proof of concept
in essence of

00:22:22.840 --> 00:22:24.600
the PACE program and
these other programs

00:22:24.660 --> 00:22:27.420
being able to get groups
together to make an impact,

00:22:27.480 --> 00:22:28.750
reversing that effect.

00:22:28.810 --> 00:22:30.300
Right, assuming that
the same mechanisms

00:22:30.360 --> 00:22:32.690
work for smoking
as they do for obesity.

00:22:32.750 --> 00:22:34.390
We hope that's the case.

00:22:34.450 --> 00:22:37.600
You know, as a doctor,
again, is there anything

00:22:37.660 --> 00:22:38.840
good about smoking?

00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:40.330
Not that I can think of.

00:22:40.390 --> 00:22:42.570
Nothing good about smoking,

00:22:42.630 --> 00:22:43.870
and is there anything good
about being obese?

00:22:44.030 --> 00:22:45.450
No.

00:22:45.510 --> 00:22:47.540
I mean, these are
lifestyle changes,

00:22:47.600 --> 00:22:49.420
these are things that people
can do for themselves.

00:22:49.480 --> 00:22:52.450
If somebody came
to your office

00:22:52.510 --> 00:22:54.270
and there was things
you could do to help them

00:22:54.330 --> 00:22:55.480
to lose weight
and you didn't,

00:22:55.540 --> 00:22:56.750
they'd be furious with you.

00:22:56.810 --> 00:22:58.180
Yet there are things
that people can get

00:22:58.240 --> 00:23:00.360
involved themselves
to make a difference,

00:23:00.420 --> 00:23:02.210
and smoking is like that,
obesity is like that.

00:23:02.270 --> 00:23:05.270
And if these networks continue
to hold up that way,

00:23:05.330 --> 00:23:07.660
you may have helped
us identify--

00:23:07.720 --> 00:23:09.570
and you've already
been working in that world--

00:23:09.630 --> 00:23:11.660
but even sharpen
our tools to influence

00:23:11.720 --> 00:23:14.300
those networks to get
positive behaviors.

00:23:14.360 --> 00:23:15.630
I certainly hope so.

00:23:15.690 --> 00:23:16.840
I mean, that's a big
motivation of mine.

00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:19.330
I have members of my family
who are afflicted

00:23:19.390 --> 00:23:21.210
with obesity and
I would love it

00:23:21.270 --> 00:23:24.690
if something that I did--
so often it's up in the sky--

00:23:24.750 --> 00:23:27.240
but if something I did
actually had a positive impact

00:23:27.300 --> 00:23:29.000
on their lives, I would
just be thrilled.

00:23:29.060 --> 00:23:30.570
So you have to take a moment
and tell us about

00:23:30.630 --> 00:23:31.870
the happiness study.

00:23:32.030 --> 00:23:34.540
Okay, yes. We also are
studying happiness.

00:23:34.600 --> 00:23:36.840
They gave this
depression questionnaire

00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:39.420
to individuals in
the Framingham Heart Study

00:23:39.480 --> 00:23:41.120
and part of that
questionnaire

00:23:41.180 --> 00:23:43.330
are several questions
on happiness.

00:23:43.390 --> 00:23:45.360
And what we're finding
there is that happiness

00:23:45.420 --> 00:23:47.390
spreads from person
to person as well.

00:23:47.450 --> 00:23:50.000
This is really interesting
because we already know

00:23:50.060 --> 00:23:51.720
that there are
these short-term effects

00:23:51.780 --> 00:23:52.780
of happiness.

00:23:52.840 --> 00:23:54.630
If I smile, it increases
the chances

00:23:54.690 --> 00:23:56.390
that you'll smile
and vice versa.

00:23:56.450 --> 00:23:58.240
It is locally contagious.

00:23:58.300 --> 00:23:59.660
But there have been
these other studies

00:23:59.720 --> 00:24:01.480
that show that
happiness is fleeting.

00:24:01.540 --> 00:24:04.810
So, for example,
if you win the lottery,

00:24:04.870 --> 00:24:07.360
you'll increase the amount
of happiness that you have

00:24:07.420 --> 00:24:09.660
for about a year,
but then after that,

00:24:09.720 --> 00:24:11.720
you're just as happy
or unhappy as you were

00:24:11.780 --> 00:24:12.840
before you won
all the money.

00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:14.030
Well, because you spent
all the money by then.

00:24:14.090 --> 00:24:15.090
Perhaps, yeah.

00:24:15.150 --> 00:24:16.810
But it's interesting because
you sort of think that,

00:24:16.870 --> 00:24:18.570
you know, if only I could
just have a million dollars,

00:24:18.630 --> 00:24:21.030
I'll be set and, as it
turns out, it's fleeting.

00:24:21.090 --> 00:24:23.090
The interesting thing
is that we find

00:24:23.150 --> 00:24:25.330
that these exams that happen
every two to four years

00:24:25.390 --> 00:24:29.240
indicate that, over
the long term,

00:24:29.300 --> 00:24:30.870
whenever your friend
becomes happier

00:24:31.030 --> 00:24:32.720
increases your
own happiness.

00:24:32.780 --> 00:24:34.390
I mean, that's amazing.

00:24:34.450 --> 00:24:36.780
We have about two minutes
left in the show

00:24:36.840 --> 00:24:39.210
and I wanted to give
you a chance to talk about

00:24:39.270 --> 00:24:42.390
if you could control
the world in the future,

00:24:42.450 --> 00:24:43.810
taking some of
these principles,

00:24:43.870 --> 00:24:45.240
the PACE study that
you've been working on,

00:24:45.300 --> 00:24:46.720
the networking that
we're talking about,

00:24:46.780 --> 00:24:48.870
how would we impact schools,
public health?

00:24:49.030 --> 00:24:51.030
Where do you see
this going one day?

00:24:51.090 --> 00:24:53.750
Well, I think certainly
schools are a great place

00:24:53.810 --> 00:24:56.060
for us to have an impact
because they give us,

00:24:56.120 --> 00:24:57.510
first of all,
an educational opportunity

00:24:57.570 --> 00:24:59.690
and there have been
some unique programs

00:24:59.750 --> 00:25:01.660
already developed
for schools.

00:25:01.720 --> 00:25:04.750
We take the attitude that,
well, we can explain

00:25:04.810 --> 00:25:06.000
that you're overweight
and you have to make

00:25:06.060 --> 00:25:07.570
these changes and
you're going to do it.

00:25:07.630 --> 00:25:09.570
But if we try to do it
more from

00:25:09.630 --> 00:25:11.840
an educational point of view,
to explain why you should

00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:14.180
make healthy choices
and here are examples,

00:25:14.240 --> 00:25:15.840
and then let the schools
have the environment

00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:17.660
where they can make
a healthy choice,

00:25:17.720 --> 00:25:19.390
it's kind of silly for us
to talk about making

00:25:19.450 --> 00:25:21.390
healthy choices and
then they can go buy soda

00:25:21.450 --> 00:25:23.630
or they could buy
Flaming Hot Cheetos

00:25:23.690 --> 00:25:27.120
from the vending machines
to do that.

00:25:27.180 --> 00:25:29.660
If we're going to effect
the change in the house,

00:25:29.720 --> 00:25:31.690
this is a great place
to making a change because,

00:25:31.750 --> 00:25:33.300
if the child comes
home and says, oh, you know,

00:25:33.360 --> 00:25:35.480
I really like getting apples,

00:25:35.540 --> 00:25:38.240
I don't want to eat
the Fritos

00:25:38.300 --> 00:25:40.300
that you're giving me
all the time, potato chips,

00:25:40.360 --> 00:25:41.480
then maybe we can
affect a change

00:25:41.540 --> 00:25:43.000
within the house as well.

00:25:43.060 --> 00:25:45.540
So understanding
and I think certainly

00:25:45.600 --> 00:25:47.090
the study you were
just talking about

00:25:47.150 --> 00:25:49.780
with the smokers quitting in
a cluster is very encouraging

00:25:49.840 --> 00:25:52.150
because it does give
weight to the evidence

00:25:52.210 --> 00:25:54.810
that we need to maybe think
about these networks

00:25:54.870 --> 00:25:57.090
and attack a network
as opposed to just

00:25:57.150 --> 00:25:59.390
looking at an
individual to do that.

00:25:59.450 --> 00:26:00.540
We see that all the time,
again, in children.

00:26:00.600 --> 00:26:02.750
We can't just say
to a family where everybody

00:26:02.810 --> 00:26:04.870
in the family is obese
and we're just talking

00:26:05.030 --> 00:26:06.390
about the eight-year-old child
and say you have

00:26:06.450 --> 00:26:07.690
to make a change
and the other family members

00:26:07.750 --> 00:26:09.450
are allowed to continue
to do whatever

00:26:09.510 --> 00:26:12.300
they were doing before,
you'll have no success at all.

00:26:12.360 --> 00:26:13.810
Well, that's neat.

00:26:13.870 --> 00:26:16.390
This is exciting and
I'm so glad both of you

00:26:16.450 --> 00:26:18.210
could come join us
to talk about this

00:26:18.270 --> 00:26:21.360
because it's of
interest anyway,

00:26:21.420 --> 00:26:24.570
but it has impact
on peoples' lives and health.

00:26:24.630 --> 00:26:27.300
Whether you know it or not,
you've already impacted people

00:26:27.360 --> 00:26:29.120
and changed their health
as a political scientist.

00:26:29.180 --> 00:26:30.660
That's what doctors do, okay?

00:26:30.720 --> 00:26:33.570
That's what M.D. doctors do,
not the PhD doctors do.

00:26:33.630 --> 00:26:36.870
I mean, congratulations
on an incredible study

00:26:37.030 --> 00:26:38.150
and I know that you're
going to be continuing

00:26:38.210 --> 00:26:40.450
to work on this and I think
that's just spectacular.

00:26:40.510 --> 00:26:42.570
And thank you for coming
to talk to us

00:26:42.630 --> 00:26:45.030
about how important all this
is and how meaningful it is.

00:26:45.090 --> 00:26:46.720
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

00:26:46.780 --> 00:26:48.180
I appreciate you both
taking the time with us.

00:26:48.240 --> 00:26:49.420
You just heard
an incredible discussion

00:26:49.480 --> 00:26:51.150
about the impact
that your social network

00:26:51.210 --> 00:26:53.510
which includes your friends,
but for kids,

00:26:53.570 --> 00:26:56.030
their family network,
what that can have

00:26:56.090 --> 00:26:57.480
on your life and health.

00:26:57.540 --> 00:26:59.360
And the trick isn't
to get rid of your friends

00:26:59.420 --> 00:27:02.210
that have it, like,
if they're obese.

00:27:02.270 --> 00:27:03.570
Because that doesn't work,
we know that.

00:27:03.630 --> 00:27:05.180
But remember that
you do have influence

00:27:05.240 --> 00:27:07.780
and that you can change
and that actually

00:27:07.840 --> 00:27:09.360
can help the people
around you as well.

00:27:09.420 --> 00:27:12.630
So let's take advantage of
these networks and flip them.

00:27:12.690 --> 00:27:14.270
Knowledge is power.

00:27:14.330 --> 00:27:15.720
The more you know,
the more you can affect

00:27:15.780 --> 00:27:17.240
your own health and,
as it turns out,

00:27:17.300 --> 00:27:19.540
the health of your friends
and your family.

00:27:19.600 --> 00:27:21.120
I'm Dr. David Granet.

00:27:21.180 --> 00:27:22.480
This has been Health Matters.

00:27:22.540 --> 00:27:24.390
We'll see you again next time.
