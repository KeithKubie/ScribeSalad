LAURENCE MORONEY: Hi.

00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:04.300
Laurence Moroney here.

00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:05.924
I'm in the Coffee
With a Googler stage,

00:00:05.924 --> 00:00:08.020
and I'm going to be
chatting with Jason Titus.

00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:10.640
He's the lead of the Developer
Product group at Google,

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:12.899
and he had so many great
announcements for developers

00:00:12.899 --> 00:00:13.940
at the keynote yesterday.

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:15.900
So Jason, welcome,
thanks for joining us.

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:16.780
JASON TITUS: Glad to be here.

00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:17.600
LAURENCE MORONEY: So
what kind of feedback

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:19.183
have you been hearing
from developers?

00:00:19.183 --> 00:00:20.058
What's been exciting?

00:00:20.058 --> 00:00:21.516
JASON TITUS: It's
been pretty cool.

00:00:21.516 --> 00:00:24.170
It seemed like folks were really
excited about the new things

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:26.786
in Android Studio, where
we're now supporting C++.

00:00:26.786 --> 00:00:28.410
LAURENCE MORONEY:
That was pretty cool.

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:30.500
JASON TITUS: A lot of folks have
been doing Native Development

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:32.369
Kit work for a while,
and they really

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:34.702
wanted to be able to have
that supported, so that that's

00:00:34.702 --> 00:00:35.370
a big step.

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:38.324
We also made Cloud
Messaging cross-platform,

00:00:38.324 --> 00:00:40.490
so now you can use it not
just on Android and Chrome

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:44.344
but also on iOS, and people
seem pretty excited about that.

00:00:44.344 --> 00:00:46.760
LAURENCE MORONEY: We added
topics to that, as well, right?

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:50.160
JASON TITUS: Yes, so now it's
a great way, essentially,

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.550
with topics and Cloud
Messaging you can just,

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:55.080
without having to manage and
track all the different users

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:57.710
that follow specific things,
you can just on the client

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:00.430
say for an arbitrary
topic you create,

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:02.540
like, I'm interested in
the San Francisco Giants

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:03.498
or something like that.

00:01:03.498 --> 00:01:05.312
You can subscribe
the client, and that

00:01:05.312 --> 00:01:07.020
could be happening
across all your users.

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:09.640
And later on, you just do
a single push notification,

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:12.830
say, new information about
San Francisco Giants,

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:15.580
and it fans out to all
of them across platform

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:17.580
without you having to do
any sort of management.

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.890
LAURENCE MORONEY: And it's
Android, iOS, and web?

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:20.260
JASON TITUS: Yeah.

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:21.660
LAURENCE MORONEY: And one of
the neat things about GCM--

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:23.534
or Google Cloud Messaging--
is like if you've

00:01:23.534 --> 00:01:25.730
got multiple devices,
if you dismiss

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:28.310
the notification on one, it can
be dismissed on all of them,

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:30.590
so you don't have that kind of
clutter in your notification

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:31.110
tray.

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:32.490
That's pretty cool, right?

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:34.642
And it's free for
developers as well.

00:01:34.642 --> 00:01:36.350
JASON TITUS: And
probably the other thing

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:39.960
that got the most excitement
was around our cloud test lab.

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:44.140
So we recognize that
there's a lot of developers

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:46.030
who are having problems
going, hey, there's

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:47.390
all these different devices.

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:48.932
I don't have access
to all of them.

00:01:48.932 --> 00:01:50.390
I want to be able
to test my stuff.

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:52.040
How do I do that?

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:54.580
And so we're going to
be rolling something out

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:57.750
that actually allows
you to upload your APK

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:00.515
and will run it across
the top 20 devices

00:02:00.515 --> 00:02:03.200
from around the world and
give you a report saying like,

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:04.950
if we run into any
issues, here's a screen

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:06.530
video of how we got there.

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:08.627
Here's crash logs,
what happened,

00:02:08.627 --> 00:02:10.585
And so you can very
quickly know whether or not

00:02:10.585 --> 00:02:11.620
you have any issues.

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:12.030
LAURENCE MORONEY:
That's pretty cool.

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:13.270
I'm looking forward to
trying that one out,

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:16.110
because it can be difficult
to try on different devices,

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:18.920
or if you live in a country
where a device isn't available,

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:20.704
then you can use the
cloud lab for that,

00:02:20.704 --> 00:02:21.700
so that's pretty cool.

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:25.590
Also Polymer 1.0 was
announced yesterday.

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:29.106
JASON TITUS: Yeah, I think
we did both Polymer 1.0

00:02:29.106 --> 00:02:31.230
and then Elements on top
of it, so you can actually

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:35.040
get libraries where a simple--
just insert an element,

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:38.945
and you can have a, map
charts, toolbars, menus,

00:02:38.945 --> 00:02:40.514
a bunch of stuff,
and I think people

00:02:40.514 --> 00:02:42.930
will start making some pretty
nice web apps based on that.

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:44.763
LAURENCE MORONEY: Cool,
that should be good.

00:02:44.763 --> 00:02:46.790
Now, with all these
little bits and pieces,

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:48.800
great releases here and
great releases there,

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:51.100
but this all must be part
of some bigger picture

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:52.820
to make developers'
lives easier?

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:56.057
JASON TITUS: Yeah,
the point of our group

00:02:56.057 --> 00:02:57.890
and what we're looking
at across the company

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:00.430
is how do we make it easier
for developers to get up

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:01.200
and running?

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:04.475
How do we solve problems that
developers actually have?

00:03:04.475 --> 00:03:06.600
I've actually only been at
Google a little bit more

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:07.230
than a year.

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:08.605
LAURENCE MORONEY:
OK, same as me.

00:03:08.605 --> 00:03:12.299
JASON TITUS: And so before
that, I was at Shazam.

00:03:12.299 --> 00:03:13.340
LAURENCE MORONEY: Oh, OK.

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:15.480
JASON TITUS: And so, I
spent 3 and 1/2 years

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:18.520
like banging my head against
the wall and kind of fighting

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:20.790
all the things you have
to do to try and get

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:24.590
an app built and successful
across different markets.

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:27.336
And I think we're
doing a bunch of things

00:03:27.336 --> 00:03:29.210
already, things we're
doing in the Play Store

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:32.310
to let you AB test listings,
making the developer

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:37.540
tools better, like on Android
studio, on iOS releasing,

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:41.020
moving to CocoaPods to make
using our libraries better.

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:43.340
These are all just about
saying how do we make it so

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:45.360
when you have an
idea or something you

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:49.329
want to build that it's easier
to do it with our stuff?

00:03:49.329 --> 00:03:50.620
And this is just the beginning.

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:53.010
I think what people
she recognizes

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:55.740
this is the first round
of just making it faster,

00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:58.842
better, easier, and you'll
see a lot more in the future.

00:03:58.842 --> 00:03:59.800
LAURENCE MORONEY: Nice.

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:01.660
And one of the themes
that you had in you

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:03.740
keynote, and we've seen
in a lot of the talks

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:07.130
is really thinking
for developers

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:11.630
this temple of developing,
engaging, and earning.

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:14.470
And that, in many ways, is
the workflow for a developer.

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:16.440
You have your idea, and
if you have your idea,

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:17.941
you want to be able
to express that.

00:04:17.941 --> 00:04:20.148
What kind of things are we
doing to help them express

00:04:20.148 --> 00:04:21.494
that and help them to learn?

00:04:21.494 --> 00:04:22.910
JASON TITUS: On
the develop front,

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:24.970
it's how do we make
it easy for you

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:27.650
to build your code like with
development tools like Android

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:28.220
Studio?

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:30.470
How do we make it easy for
you to sign up for anything

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:31.860
you need to use?

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:36.450
We have a new flow to sign up
for analytics and messaging

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:40.260
and all that, that we think gets
rid of a lot of the pain there.

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:42.960
And then we redid the
entire Google Developer

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:44.804
site, google.com site.

00:04:44.804 --> 00:04:46.720
Hopefully folks will
find it much more useful.

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:48.000
LAURENCE MORONEY: I see
that just launched, right?

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:49.541
JASON TITUS: Yes,
that just came out,

00:04:49.541 --> 00:04:51.980
and that's a redesign
of the entire site.

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:54.960
So that's all things around how
to make it easier to develop.

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:58.580
On the engage side, we're
recognizing that folks really

00:04:58.580 --> 00:04:59.630
want to get new users.

00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:00.976
You've got your app done.

00:05:00.976 --> 00:05:02.100
You upload it to the Store.

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:05.000
Like, how am I going
actually find folks?

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:06.970
So both making it
easier on the Play

00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:09.560
Store to try and find
the best way to pitch it.

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:11.000
Like, how do you
describe the app?

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:15.300
Try two or three different
texts for your listing,

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:18.847
try different icons,
see what works best,

00:05:18.847 --> 00:05:20.430
giving you the ability
once somebody's

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:22.805
sold your app, making it really
easy to message with them

00:05:22.805 --> 00:05:24.860
and do notifications.

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:26.521
And then for our
folks who actually

00:05:26.521 --> 00:05:28.770
want to start buying app,
install ads, and try and buy

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:31.810
distribution, I think maybe it's
been harder than it should have

00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:34.462
been with us, and
so we're starting

00:05:34.462 --> 00:05:35.920
the process of
getting it like here

00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:37.470
is a single place you can go.

00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:39.950
It'll be in the Google
Play Developer Console.

00:05:39.950 --> 00:05:42.200
You can buy across
all of Google.

00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:45.210
You can just say, I'm willing
to spend $200 a month,

00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:49.650
and I'll pay this amount per
install, and we'll just do it,

00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:51.302
set up the campaign for you.

00:05:51.302 --> 00:05:53.260
And I think that's the
kind of thing you should

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:54.580
expect to see more from us.

00:05:54.580 --> 00:05:57.580
It's just ways to
make it easier,

00:05:57.580 --> 00:06:01.020
fewer knobs and dials,
more straight to the meat

00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:02.620
of the things you need done.

00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:03.340
LAURENCE MORONEY: Sounds good.

00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:04.930
And for engaging, there
was one technology

00:06:04.930 --> 00:06:05.846
that I really enjoyed.

00:06:05.846 --> 00:06:07.430
It's the app invites.

00:06:07.430 --> 00:06:08.360
JASON TITUS: Yeah.

00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:10.734
LAURENCE MORONEY: Because,
for me, we had a talk about it

00:06:10.734 --> 00:06:12.580
yesterday.

00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:15.360
I discover most
apps from friends.

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:18.620
Magnus was my co-speaker, and he
sends me all these crazy hockey

00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:20.510
apps, and my son sends
me all these games.

00:06:20.510 --> 00:06:22.260
When you've got friends sending
you apps that you can trust,

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:24.950
the the app invite technology
is really good to help engage.

00:06:24.950 --> 00:06:27.100
JASON TITUS: Yeah, and
that came out of saying,

00:06:27.100 --> 00:06:30.100
what are the main things
developers are trying to do?

00:06:30.100 --> 00:06:33.570
We see again and again and again
developers build invite flows,

00:06:33.570 --> 00:06:36.030
and it's like like, OK,
how are we going to get it?

00:06:36.030 --> 00:06:38.430
Most app installs are
happening from word of mouth.

00:06:38.430 --> 00:06:39.596
How are we going to do that?

00:06:39.596 --> 00:06:41.960
Oh, we'll build an
app invite flow.

00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:44.520
It turns out that we
actually have bunch of data

00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:47.760
that we can use to make it more
useful for a particular user.

00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:49.940
Like if you use
Google services, we

00:06:49.940 --> 00:06:53.082
have a better sense of
across your 1,000 contacts,

00:06:53.082 --> 00:06:55.040
you are the ones you
actually communicate with,

00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:57.100
and we can sort of
bubble those to the top

00:06:57.100 --> 00:06:59.390
and make it easier for
you to share with folks

00:06:59.390 --> 00:07:00.990
you're more likely
to share with.

00:07:00.990 --> 00:07:02.406
And that's something
that would be

00:07:02.406 --> 00:07:04.510
very hard to do as a
third-party developer,

00:07:04.510 --> 00:07:06.910
but we can provide that
to you as a service,

00:07:06.910 --> 00:07:09.440
and we think it'll make it
easier, and then over time,

00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:12.180
just reduce the friction, make
it easier for the install flow

00:07:12.180 --> 00:07:13.410
to work, all that.

00:07:13.410 --> 00:07:15.118
LAURENCE MORONEY: And
If I'm a developer,

00:07:15.118 --> 00:07:16.940
I can then focus on
my domain expertise,

00:07:16.940 --> 00:07:19.542
instead of trying to
roll an app invite.

00:07:19.542 --> 00:07:22.000
JASON TITUS: The reality is
that most developers are coming

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:23.850
at something where
they say, I know

00:07:23.850 --> 00:07:25.284
I have a better
way of doing this

00:07:25.284 --> 00:07:26.450
than other people have done.

00:07:26.450 --> 00:07:27.890
I'm going to build this app.

00:07:27.890 --> 00:07:30.400
it's going to make it easier
to organize a block party

00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:33.500
or sell these
things or whatever.

00:07:33.500 --> 00:07:36.120
And they shouldn't have spent a
bunch of time rewriting things

00:07:36.120 --> 00:07:37.828
that everybody else
has written, and they

00:07:37.828 --> 00:07:40.930
shouldn't have to spend
forever gearing up and signing

00:07:40.930 --> 00:07:42.062
up, and configuring things.

00:07:42.062 --> 00:07:44.270
They should be able to say,
OK, I need notifications.

00:07:44.270 --> 00:07:45.410
Boom, it's in.

00:07:45.410 --> 00:07:45.965
I need this.

00:07:45.965 --> 00:07:46.784
It's set up for me.

00:07:46.784 --> 00:07:48.700
Now I spend my time
working on the part that's

00:07:48.700 --> 00:07:49.502
unique to my app.

00:07:49.502 --> 00:07:50.460
LAURENCE MORONEY: Cool.

00:07:50.460 --> 00:07:52.670
So there's a wealth of new
stuff that you've announced,

00:07:52.670 --> 00:07:55.336
and there's a whole lot of stuff
that we're actually working on,

00:07:55.336 --> 00:07:58.580
particularly like a lot of iOS
stuff that we've announced.

00:07:58.580 --> 00:08:02.145
But you're only just
getting started, right?

00:08:02.145 --> 00:08:03.520
JASON TITUS: Like
I said, I think

00:08:03.520 --> 00:08:06.770
you're seeing these as the
beginnings of sanding down

00:08:06.770 --> 00:08:09.510
the sharp edges, taking
the things that we've

00:08:09.510 --> 00:08:12.480
gotten feedback that are
hard and making them easier.

00:08:12.480 --> 00:08:14.959
But we have a lot more
in store in the future

00:08:14.959 --> 00:08:16.750
that we think will be
great for developers.

00:08:16.750 --> 00:08:17.708
LAURENCE MORONEY: Cool.

00:08:17.708 --> 00:08:20.200
Well, thank you so much,
Jason, and thank you everybody.

00:08:20.200 --> 00:08:22.429
Remember the new
developers.google.com is live.

00:08:22.429 --> 00:08:24.470
Go and check it out, and
you can learn about some

00:08:24.470 --> 00:08:26.700
of these great technologies
that we were talking about.

00:08:26.700 --> 00:08:27.455
Thank you so much.

00:08:27.455 --> 00:08:28.300
And thanks again.

00:08:28.300 --> 00:08:29.850
JASON TITUS: Thank you.
