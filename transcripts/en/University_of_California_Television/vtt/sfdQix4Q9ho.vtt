00:00:01.167 --> 00:00:03.917
(dramatic music)

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:32.260
- Welcome to A Conversation With History.

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:33.470
I'm Harry Kreisler

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:35.830
of the Institute of International Studies.

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:39.050
Our distinguished guest
today is Jim Peebles

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:41.830
who is one of the world's
foremost cosmologists

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:45.300
and Emeritus Professor
at Princeton University,

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.430
where, since 1984,

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:50.563
he was the Albert Einstein
Professor of Science.

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:54.980
Professor Peebles is
the Hitchcock professor

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:59.460
on the Berkeley campus for
the fall 2006 semester.

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:00.980
Jim, welcome to Berkeley.

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:01.813
- Thank you.

00:01:01.813 --> 00:01:03.740
- Where were you born and raised?

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:06.210
- In Manitoba, the center of Canada,

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:09.400
to the south of the province in the born,

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:11.420
and early life in St. Boniface,

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:14.030
the sister city of Winnipeg,

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:19.030
then later in St. Vital,
public schools, small schools,

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:21.520
and then on to the University of Manitoba.

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:24.350
- And looking back, how
do you think your parents

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:27.440
shaped you're thinking about the world,

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:30.090
or maybe in your case, I
should say the Universe.

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.560
- We didn't talk about the Universe.

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:34.750
My father though was
very good with his hands.

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:35.890
He built things,

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:38.590
and that very much grabbed my attention.

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:43.520
I, as a youth, didn't pay too
much attention to the stars,

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:46.340
although I remember being
impressed by Aurora,

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:48.590
but I did pay a lot of
attention to building things.

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:49.650
I'd build sleds

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:53.985
I'd build inexpensive radio receivers.

00:01:53.985 --> 00:01:55.250
I liked to work with my hands,

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:59.350
and that I think must have
been inspired by my father.

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:03.530
- As a young person, did you,
were you drawn to science.

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:06.460
I mean, in talking in high
school, middle school.

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:09.420
- I didn't know what
science was in high school.

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:11.740
It wasn't a, I shouldn't complain.

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:13.120
It was a good school.

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:14.010
I learned things,

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:17.940
but I didn't learn very
much about modern science,

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:19.513
even modern mathematics.

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:22.663
It was quite a shock to go to university.

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:26.490
- Mm-hmm, and you've
mentioned your university.

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:28.640
In what way were you shocked,

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:31.150
and what did you major in after the shock?

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:32.970
- It was a wonderful place.

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:35.833
So many bright people doing
so many interesting things.

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:39.590
Because I was not a diligent
student in high school,

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:41.890
I didn't have a clear
idea what I wanted to do

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:45.990
except that I did feel I'd like
to continue with education.

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:47.610
I knew I liked to build things,

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:51.023
so I went to, I enrolled at
the university in engineering.

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:54.500
That was okay, and I guess I could have

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:56.420
become a mediocre engineer,

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:58.650
but to my great good fortune,

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:01.423
friends persuaded me to
transfer over to physics.

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:05.160
I can't say it was a eureka moment,

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:06.810
I just stopped complaining
(Harry laughing)

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:09.130
and started doing my homework.

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:10.820
- so it felt natural to you?

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:12.070
- [James] Somehow it felt right.

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:12.903
- [Harry] Yeah

00:03:12.903 --> 00:03:13.736
- And I never looked back.

00:03:13.736 --> 00:03:15.400
I've never had asked myself should I

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:16.400
have done something else.

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:18.470
No, this was right for me.

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:20.850
- Did you have any
teachers at the university

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:24.450
that were very influential
in pointing you in a--

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:26.043
- Super, super.

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:30.250
It's not a world famous
university perhaps,

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:31.920
but there were excellent faculty,

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:35.550
and they really inspired me in physics.

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:39.010
I consider myself a
physicist, not an astronomer,

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:42.730
and I learned, I took
no courses in astronomy.

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:46.033
I didn't even know about
stars when I left Manitoba.

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:49.410
- And then where did you
go to graduate school?

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:52.090
- Princeton University in New Jersey.

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:56.100
I came there intending
to continue my interest

00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:58.713
in quantum physics, particle physics,

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:02.380
but didn't although there
were excellent people

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:04.960
doing that sort of thing at Princeton.

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:08.803
Instead I met my lifelong
teacher from then on, Bob Dicke,

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:12.883
who inspired me to follow him.

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:19.187
He had been a great
contributor to quantum optics.

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:24.450
In the years from the second
world war into the 50s,

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:26.250
he was one of the leading figures

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:28.960
in figuring out quantum optics,

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:31.003
the development of measures and lasers.

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:35.580
Some wonderfully ingenious
inventions in that field,

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:37.560
but then he decided gravity physics

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:40.450
was being very neglected as a subject

00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:42.040
for research in physics.

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:43.680
He started working on that,

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:45.420
and what he was doing was so fascinating,

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:46.773
I just trailed along.

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:52.500
- And what what did you wind
up doing your dissertation on,

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:53.920
I assume, under his influence?

00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:57.060
- Under his influence, project of,

00:04:57.060 --> 00:05:01.070
you know there is in
physics constants of nature,

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:03.410
the numbers that
characterize interactions,

00:05:03.410 --> 00:05:05.450
in particular the strength

00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:08.800
of the electromagnetic interaction
is measured by a number

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:11.400
called the fine-structure constant.

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:13.570
Bob was fascinated by the question

00:05:13.570 --> 00:05:18.060
could such numbers be not
fixed numbers but rather vary.

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:20.860
It was on his part more philosophical

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:22.940
than based on anything firm.

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:26.700
Somewhat ironic that these
days within superstring theory,

00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:28.921
people are convinced these
numbers ought to vary

00:05:28.921 --> 00:05:31.823
with time and maybe
slightly with position.

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:36.850
In any case, he set me
the task find evidence,

00:05:36.850 --> 00:05:38.430
though we constrained how much this number

00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:40.240
could have varied through time.

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:41.810
Turns out there are lots of ways to do it.

00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:44.090
In particular in those days,

00:05:44.090 --> 00:05:46.960
one had pretty well
developed already the concept

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:49.820
of radioactive decay,
of long-lived isotopes,

00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:53.560
as a method of measuring
the ages of rocks.

00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:56.580
Different radio activities
decay at different rates,

00:05:56.580 --> 00:05:57.670
leave different products.

00:05:57.670 --> 00:06:00.640
You can count the products, deduce an age,

00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:04.030
under the assumption that
the decay rate is constant,

00:06:04.030 --> 00:06:06.310
but if the strength of the
electromagnetic interaction

00:06:06.310 --> 00:06:09.470
were varying, that would
change the decay rate,

00:06:09.470 --> 00:06:11.950
and so different decay chains would

00:06:11.950 --> 00:06:14.270
give inconsistent answers.

00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:16.310
Kind of neat, so I learned some geology,

00:06:16.310 --> 00:06:18.500
which I'd never done before,

00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:19.990
and I learned some astronomy

00:06:19.990 --> 00:06:22.120
because you can also
look at great distances.

00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:23.800
You see things as they were in the past,

00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:25.613
and again make some checks.

00:06:26.740 --> 00:06:28.513
So my thesis, in a way,

00:06:30.220 --> 00:06:35.220
was leading up to some very modern ideas.

00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:36.560
I had no idea of course.

00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:41.560
- [Harry] Mm-hmm, and I get
the sense in your lecture,

00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:42.620
and what you're saying now,

00:06:42.620 --> 00:06:46.030
that this community that you're a part of,

00:06:46.030 --> 00:06:49.980
and it may actually transcend
the particular subfield

00:06:49.980 --> 00:06:53.360
within physics, it may
include all of the sciences,

00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:56.690
that there's a kind of movement forward,

00:06:56.690 --> 00:06:59.540
as the collaborations emerge,

00:06:59.540 --> 00:07:00.760
or the insights emerged,

00:07:00.760 --> 00:07:02.370
which then influence your own thinking.

00:07:02.370 --> 00:07:04.240
You just suggested that
in your dissertation.

00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:07.514
- Oh, yes, yes, we build
upon previous work.

00:07:07.514 --> 00:07:11.740
It's so important that we
have a basis of knowledge

00:07:11.740 --> 00:07:13.890
and understanding that we build upon,

00:07:13.890 --> 00:07:17.230
and we hope add to, for
the next generation.

00:07:17.230 --> 00:07:20.520
By no means is any one individual,

00:07:20.520 --> 00:07:23.310
one of my heroes is Bob Dicke, my teacher,

00:07:23.310 --> 00:07:25.970
but I have to admit he
wasn't essential to the game.

00:07:25.970 --> 00:07:28.020
Other's would have done what he did.

00:07:28.020 --> 00:07:30.433
What is essential is that
institutional memory.

00:07:31.770 --> 00:07:35.360
I sometimes think of science as a craft.

00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:36.193
- [Harry] Mm-hmm.

00:07:36.193 --> 00:07:38.500
- In the sense that you learn it

00:07:38.500 --> 00:07:40.750
from the previous
generation who learned it

00:07:40.750 --> 00:07:42.523
from their previous generation.

00:07:44.210 --> 00:07:47.991
I would hate to imagine
doing science de neuvo.

00:07:47.991 --> 00:07:49.170
- [Harry] Mm-hmm.

00:07:49.170 --> 00:07:50.700
- You would, to start all over again

00:07:50.700 --> 00:07:52.690
would be to start all over again.

00:07:52.690 --> 00:07:55.350
We'd have to go through another
Galileo, another Newton.

00:07:55.350 --> 00:07:56.200
- [Harry] Mm-hmm.

00:07:57.240 --> 00:07:58.140
This touches on a question

00:07:58.140 --> 00:07:59.840
that I always like to ask the scientists.

00:07:59.840 --> 00:08:04.840
That is, what are the skills
that people should have,

00:08:05.490 --> 00:08:07.370
and also what are the virtues

00:08:07.370 --> 00:08:09.810
that make for a good scientist?

00:08:09.810 --> 00:08:13.290
- In part, what's the most optimum skill,

00:08:13.290 --> 00:08:14.520
is a function of time.

00:08:14.520 --> 00:08:17.470
As the subject evolves,
different skills are needed.

00:08:17.470 --> 00:08:20.210
I have the strong feeling, for example,

00:08:20.210 --> 00:08:24.360
that another respected
figure, Fritz Zwicky,

00:08:24.360 --> 00:08:26.610
was just right for his time in astronomy

00:08:26.610 --> 00:08:29.790
when there were lots of
new ideas poorly explored,

00:08:29.790 --> 00:08:32.210
but might not have done so well today

00:08:32.210 --> 00:08:34.480
when we have a fixed set
of ideas that we're trying

00:08:34.480 --> 00:08:36.303
to build upon.

00:08:37.370 --> 00:08:39.360
He was too independent minded in a way.

00:08:39.360 --> 00:08:41.270
It's good to be independent of course,

00:08:41.270 --> 00:08:43.660
but you have also to pay attention

00:08:43.660 --> 00:08:45.330
to what other people are thinking.

00:08:45.330 --> 00:08:47.440
He didn't like doing that.

00:08:47.440 --> 00:08:50.140
That was right for his time, now it's not.

00:08:50.140 --> 00:08:53.790
But of course there are
surely general features

00:08:53.790 --> 00:08:56.520
that people should should carry along,

00:08:56.520 --> 00:08:59.773
and one of them, intellectual honesty.

00:09:01.840 --> 00:09:05.680
Did I really say that,
you may ask yourself,

00:09:05.680 --> 00:09:07.533
oh, what a stupid thing to do.

00:09:08.730 --> 00:09:11.010
In life it's very difficult
to say that sometimes,

00:09:11.010 --> 00:09:12.620
but if you're going to do well in science,

00:09:12.620 --> 00:09:15.163
you'd better learn from your mistakes.

00:09:16.250 --> 00:09:18.280
So that is one, I think, introspection.

00:09:18.280 --> 00:09:21.240
Ask yourself, did I really mean that,

00:09:21.240 --> 00:09:24.160
and is this observation really consistent

00:09:24.160 --> 00:09:25.783
with my fixed beliefs?

00:09:27.540 --> 00:09:30.340
Of course, there are many
kinds of science too.

00:09:30.340 --> 00:09:33.100
There is the deeply mathematical sort,

00:09:33.100 --> 00:09:35.220
like superstring theory.

00:09:35.220 --> 00:09:37.750
Those guys can't pay too
much attention to the data,

00:09:37.750 --> 00:09:39.240
'cause there isn't much that's relevant

00:09:39.240 --> 00:09:41.270
to their deep ideas.

00:09:41.270 --> 00:09:45.210
On the other hand, the kind
of science I love doing

00:09:46.340 --> 00:09:49.230
is that which is comes
into pretty close contact

00:09:49.230 --> 00:09:51.120
with what people are measuring,

00:09:51.120 --> 00:09:55.040
and there I see a lovely interplay.

00:09:55.040 --> 00:09:56.860
What are the observations suggesting?

00:09:56.860 --> 00:09:59.180
What is the theory suggest?

00:09:59.180 --> 00:10:00.803
Are they really consistent?

00:10:02.610 --> 00:10:06.263
Curiosity of course, in
any human endeavor surely.

00:10:07.200 --> 00:10:08.873
An interest in what's going on.

00:10:10.870 --> 00:10:15.870
Mathematics, I have never been
a very good mathematician.

00:10:16.750 --> 00:10:18.220
I struggle with it.

00:10:18.220 --> 00:10:19.280
I hate it.

00:10:19.280 --> 00:10:21.140
- [Harry] Must be speaking
relatively speaking.

00:10:21.140 --> 00:10:22.513
- I don't know but I,

00:10:23.610 --> 00:10:26.420
it is true I think that
I only do mathematics

00:10:26.420 --> 00:10:31.420
because it produces this
wonderful interaction

00:10:31.640 --> 00:10:33.800
between theory and observation.

00:10:33.800 --> 00:10:35.760
I think if that weren't happening

00:10:35.760 --> 00:10:38.373
I would do something less difficult.

00:10:39.970 --> 00:10:41.284
What would it be, I don't know.

00:10:41.284 --> 00:10:42.798
(both laughing)

00:10:42.798 --> 00:10:45.160
- (stumbling over words) Well, go ahead.

00:10:45.160 --> 00:10:46.160
Did you want anything else?

00:10:46.160 --> 00:10:47.370
Because I was just gonna--

00:10:47.370 --> 00:10:48.900
- No, no, let's go on.

00:10:48.900 --> 00:10:51.710
- Well, one of the themes
that emerged in your lectures,

00:10:51.710 --> 00:10:55.460
and often in my discussion
with scientists,

00:10:55.460 --> 00:10:58.440
is a willingness to collaborate,

00:10:58.440 --> 00:11:00.112
but also compete, basically.

00:11:00.112 --> 00:11:02.103
- Oh yes, oh yes.

00:11:03.090 --> 00:11:04.493
We're a nasty bunch.

00:11:05.410 --> 00:11:07.830
We try to get ahead on the other person.

00:11:07.830 --> 00:11:10.930
That's partly, I guess, just
human instinct, isn't it?

00:11:10.930 --> 00:11:12.940
You like to run faster than that friend

00:11:12.940 --> 00:11:14.920
next to you when you jog.

00:11:14.920 --> 00:11:16.823
Competition, it's not unhealthy,

00:11:17.740 --> 00:11:20.690
but cooperation, we don't
get nowhere without it,

00:11:20.690 --> 00:11:23.350
and so, yes, I have to admit,

00:11:23.350 --> 00:11:25.290
you have the better argument there,

00:11:25.290 --> 00:11:27.690
but I'm gonna get you next time.

00:11:27.690 --> 00:11:31.943
Competition very important though, why?

00:11:33.230 --> 00:11:35.090
As I reached the golden years,

00:11:35.090 --> 00:11:37.425
I feel less competitive,

00:11:37.425 --> 00:11:40.557
but I still want to beat
out that other person.

00:11:40.557 --> 00:11:42.866
(both laughing)

00:11:42.866 --> 00:11:45.620
- That's good.

00:11:45.620 --> 00:11:47.280
Let me see if there was something else.

00:11:47.280 --> 00:11:50.580
Yeah, I did want to emphasize
again something you just said,

00:11:50.580 --> 00:11:51.530
but you said it in the lecture.

00:11:51.530 --> 00:11:54.120
There's really this synergy

00:11:54.120 --> 00:11:58.030
between theory and observations.

00:11:58.030 --> 00:12:01.468
That is, you know, it's
really an important part

00:12:01.468 --> 00:12:04.370
of this work that you're doing.

00:12:04.370 --> 00:12:05.720
- It is so important.

00:12:05.720 --> 00:12:10.350
Of course, this is what science
is, in my way of thinking.

00:12:10.350 --> 00:12:13.233
The synergy, it's been
there since the beginning.

00:12:14.640 --> 00:12:17.630
When we run out of synergy,

00:12:17.630 --> 00:12:19.770
then science goes in a
very different direction,

00:12:19.770 --> 00:12:23.230
and one that I'm not
sure I want to to follow.

00:12:23.230 --> 00:12:24.980
There was never any guarantee, you know,

00:12:24.980 --> 00:12:27.243
that this synergy would be useful.

00:12:28.530 --> 00:12:31.350
No one ever guaranteed that
we'd be able to make sense

00:12:31.350 --> 00:12:32.913
of the world around us.

00:12:34.150 --> 00:12:36.760
It's a striking thing that
we've gone as far as we have,

00:12:36.760 --> 00:12:39.530
and we've come in an amazingly long way.

00:12:39.530 --> 00:12:42.450
All of modern technology so much depends

00:12:42.450 --> 00:12:44.570
on that curiosity-driven research,

00:12:44.570 --> 00:12:47.910
the synergy of a decade
ago, a century ago.

00:12:47.910 --> 00:12:48.943
Will it continue?

00:12:50.090 --> 00:12:51.750
We'll find out.

00:12:51.750 --> 00:12:54.370
- You were talking yesterday
in your introduction,

00:12:54.370 --> 00:12:55.250
the second lecture,

00:12:55.250 --> 00:12:58.600
and you're talking about what science is,

00:12:58.600 --> 00:13:00.867
and you said "Science is a search

00:13:00.867 --> 00:13:03.947
"for successive approximations.

00:13:03.947 --> 00:13:06.097
"Good approximation to reality,

00:13:06.097 --> 00:13:08.027
"but a long way to go.

00:13:08.027 --> 00:13:10.760
"No absolute truth in
the physical sciences."

00:13:10.760 --> 00:13:11.900
So in a way you

00:13:11.900 --> 00:13:15.580
have to live with
uncertainty and frustration,

00:13:15.580 --> 00:13:18.530
I guess, if you're going
to live by that ethos.

00:13:18.530 --> 00:13:21.060
- Oh yes, you know there is talk

00:13:21.060 --> 00:13:22.750
of the theory of everything.

00:13:22.750 --> 00:13:24.220
I think it's poorly chosen words.

00:13:24.220 --> 00:13:25.880
They don't really mean that.

00:13:25.880 --> 00:13:29.240
No one in physical
science fools themselves

00:13:29.240 --> 00:13:31.350
into thinking we know absolute truth.

00:13:31.350 --> 00:13:35.890
Always, always, we have to accept

00:13:35.890 --> 00:13:38.020
that although we have brilliant successes,

00:13:38.020 --> 00:13:41.713
we also have amazing gaps
in our understanding.

00:13:42.810 --> 00:13:44.370
The gaps are being filled,

00:13:44.370 --> 00:13:46.640
and it is characteristic
of our subjects so far

00:13:46.640 --> 00:13:49.270
that as you fill gaps, you open new ones,

00:13:49.270 --> 00:13:50.633
new questions arise.

00:13:51.710 --> 00:13:53.370
I wanted to emphasize that

00:13:53.370 --> 00:13:58.300
because one misconception
about science often is

00:13:58.300 --> 00:14:01.150
that look if you can't
answer all my questions

00:14:01.150 --> 00:14:03.590
then you don't know what
you're talking about,

00:14:03.590 --> 00:14:05.230
but that isn't true in science.

00:14:05.230 --> 00:14:07.940
We can answer some questions very well,

00:14:07.940 --> 00:14:10.110
and we can prove it by the technology

00:14:10.110 --> 00:14:13.400
to which these answers bring us,

00:14:13.400 --> 00:14:16.620
but at the same time
there are open issues.

00:14:16.620 --> 00:14:17.703
And of course, if there
weren't those open issues,

00:14:17.703 --> 00:14:21.250
there'd would be no more science to do,

00:14:21.250 --> 00:14:25.303
and we're not in any danger
of being in that state.

00:14:26.530 --> 00:14:30.530
- Now this relates, I think, to a problem

00:14:30.530 --> 00:14:34.220
that science probably has
in its broader environment

00:14:34.220 --> 00:14:35.053
that is the field,

00:14:35.053 --> 00:14:39.430
which is that really key here is is doing,

00:14:39.430 --> 00:14:41.410
basic science is very important

00:14:41.410 --> 00:14:44.300
because there the people
who fund the science,

00:14:44.300 --> 00:14:46.690
whether it's the government
or the foundations, whatever,

00:14:46.690 --> 00:14:49.780
can say well what's this for,
you know, why should we do.

00:14:49.780 --> 00:14:51.900
So that is a really key element.

00:14:51.900 --> 00:14:55.320
So this uncertainty as one looks

00:14:55.320 --> 00:14:58.460
for these approximations
to move toward truth

00:14:58.460 --> 00:15:02.530
is also enveloped in big questions

00:15:02.530 --> 00:15:05.090
whose relevance might
not be clear to people

00:15:05.090 --> 00:15:06.310
who are not doing the work.

00:15:06.310 --> 00:15:09.360
- And we must emphasize the
excitement, the adventure,

00:15:09.360 --> 00:15:11.630
of exploring new questions,

00:15:11.630 --> 00:15:14.280
and on occasion, finding answers.

00:15:14.280 --> 00:15:18.810
That excitement I believe
carries on to excitement

00:15:18.810 --> 00:15:23.400
in more applied areas of physical science.

00:15:23.400 --> 00:15:25.350
I've got a hope that an engineer

00:15:25.350 --> 00:15:28.550
who develops the next
generation of cell phones,

00:15:28.550 --> 00:15:31.100
they should only make them
not work in automobiles,

00:15:32.120 --> 00:15:35.430
will be in part excited
by what the engineer

00:15:35.430 --> 00:15:39.940
sees around herself of
advances in other fields,

00:15:39.940 --> 00:15:41.930
including the most basic.

00:15:41.930 --> 00:15:45.210
I would never claim, maybe
I'll will be wrong someday,

00:15:45.210 --> 00:15:47.440
I'd never claimed that
my subject is going to be

00:15:47.440 --> 00:15:49.090
of any practical use.

00:15:49.090 --> 00:15:52.440
Who cares what's going on
on that distant galaxy,

00:15:52.440 --> 00:15:54.340
except that you really do care.

00:15:54.340 --> 00:15:57.410
Isn't it neat to think
you can deduce properties

00:15:57.410 --> 00:15:59.090
of a galaxy way over on the other side

00:15:59.090 --> 00:16:00.643
of the observable Universe.

00:16:01.520 --> 00:16:03.000
Neat to think that we can

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:06.880
understand its nature, in broad outline,

00:16:06.880 --> 00:16:08.970
even though we'll never
be able to go over there

00:16:08.970 --> 00:16:12.000
and poke our finger on
a planet in that galaxy

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:13.940
and ask who's home.

00:16:13.940 --> 00:16:17.140
Intellectual excitement, I
hope, is an essential part

00:16:17.140 --> 00:16:20.153
of our society and of its growth.

00:16:22.720 --> 00:16:24.190
- You're touching on something,

00:16:24.190 --> 00:16:27.310
because, you know, people
who don't do physics

00:16:27.310 --> 00:16:29.710
are really interested in the stars.

00:16:29.710 --> 00:16:30.800
They're stargazers.

00:16:30.800 --> 00:16:32.250
I mean of course there's all,

00:16:33.420 --> 00:16:35.840
one level we know the
interest in science fiction,

00:16:35.840 --> 00:16:39.520
you know and what's you
know beyond what we can see

00:16:39.520 --> 00:16:41.703
with the naked eye, and so on,

00:16:43.140 --> 00:16:46.410
and then of course it gets into
a moral dimension, you know.

00:16:46.410 --> 00:16:49.890
Who are we, you know, what is man,

00:16:49.890 --> 00:16:51.700
how were we placed here, and so on.

00:16:51.700 --> 00:16:56.700
So any thoughts about how
physics can lead to a place

00:16:59.160 --> 00:17:04.160
where other people are posing questions,

00:17:05.814 --> 00:17:08.564
although they have no interest
in the physical science.

00:17:10.250 --> 00:17:12.483
- A remark about physics and astronomy,

00:17:13.400 --> 00:17:16.130
many people are fascinated by astronomy.

00:17:16.130 --> 00:17:18.210
It's astronomy's secret weapon.

00:17:18.210 --> 00:17:20.130
Surely congressional aides

00:17:20.130 --> 00:17:23.013
are a little bit biased toward astronomy.

00:17:24.100 --> 00:17:26.690
I am now, what am I called,

00:17:26.690 --> 00:17:28.180
I am now a naturalized citizen.

00:17:28.180 --> 00:17:31.700
I was for many years a landed immigrant.

00:17:31.700 --> 00:17:36.430
I actually had a green card
that was green, that old,

00:17:36.430 --> 00:17:39.780
and in those days, when
arriving from a trip overseas,

00:17:39.780 --> 00:17:42.690
I would have to explain
to customs and immigration

00:17:43.600 --> 00:17:45.360
what I did for a living,

00:17:45.360 --> 00:17:48.267
and I would sometimes
say I'm an astronomer.

00:17:48.267 --> 00:17:51.270
"Oh, isn't that interesting"
(Harry laughing)

00:17:51.270 --> 00:17:53.737
or I might say I'm a physicist.

00:17:53.737 --> 00:17:56.337
"I took physics in
school, and I hated it."

00:17:57.980 --> 00:18:00.920
You notice that there are
amateur astronomy clubs.

00:18:00.920 --> 00:18:03.200
These people are marvelous.

00:18:03.200 --> 00:18:05.100
They work all day at a job,

00:18:05.100 --> 00:18:07.680
and then at night, they do
what they love, astronomy.

00:18:07.680 --> 00:18:08.920
I'm so embarrassed.

00:18:08.920 --> 00:18:10.520
I do what I love during the day.

00:18:11.550 --> 00:18:15.403
There are no, I know of
no amateur physics club,

00:18:16.660 --> 00:18:18.100
amateur particle physics.

00:18:18.100 --> 00:18:20.800
Wouldn't it be marvelous
if there was such a club?

00:18:20.800 --> 00:18:21.740
But there aren't.

00:18:21.740 --> 00:18:23.890
So that's the way people are.

00:18:23.890 --> 00:18:27.060
To me, I don't really draw a distinction

00:18:27.060 --> 00:18:31.700
between astronomy and particle physics,

00:18:31.700 --> 00:18:35.200
and I don't see any moral
aspect to it all either,

00:18:35.200 --> 00:18:36.500
to be blunt.

00:18:36.500 --> 00:18:38.623
It's all part of the world around us.

00:18:39.480 --> 00:18:42.120
The small, the big, they're both neat,

00:18:42.120 --> 00:18:43.650
but I wouldn't give precedent

00:18:43.650 --> 00:18:46.053
to one over the other, I think.

00:18:47.520 --> 00:18:51.860
- I wonder if you would compare
the awe that that you feel

00:18:51.860 --> 00:18:53.810
as a scientist,

00:18:53.810 --> 00:18:58.331
as you come to understand
these these structures

00:18:58.331 --> 00:19:01.330
of the Universe,

00:19:01.330 --> 00:19:04.060
to say the awe that somebody feels

00:19:04.060 --> 00:19:09.060
who just, you know, emotionally
appreciates what they say

00:19:12.880 --> 00:19:15.130
by just looking at the stars, so to speak.

00:19:15.130 --> 00:19:16.980
- Or looking at a giant redwood.

00:19:16.980 --> 00:19:17.900
- [Harry] Yeah.

00:19:17.900 --> 00:19:19.770
- Is the awe any different

00:19:19.770 --> 00:19:21.280
- [Harry] Yeah, that's the question.

00:19:21.280 --> 00:19:22.680
- To me, no.

00:19:22.680 --> 00:19:26.020
There is the awe of realizing

00:19:26.020 --> 00:19:28.513
that we can make sense
of the world around us.

00:19:29.400 --> 00:19:31.900
Sometimes when I look at
our political situation

00:19:31.900 --> 00:19:33.173
I don't have that awe,

00:19:34.120 --> 00:19:37.550
but when I look at what
can be done in astronomy,

00:19:37.550 --> 00:19:41.860
I am awed but when I
look at what can be done

00:19:41.860 --> 00:19:45.680
with the subatomic nature
of matter, I'm awed too.

00:19:45.680 --> 00:19:46.513
It's both neat,

00:19:48.430 --> 00:19:51.033
and so is a tree or a person.

00:19:53.100 --> 00:19:55.470
I've just been reading a wonderful history

00:19:55.470 --> 00:19:59.250
of the discovery of DNA.

00:19:59.250 --> 00:20:02.900
What an awesome set of work, brilliant,

00:20:02.900 --> 00:20:05.283
and I'm awed by the structure of DNA.

00:20:07.130 --> 00:20:10.640
- Do you think, you know, if you think

00:20:10.640 --> 00:20:12.720
about the future of science,

00:20:12.720 --> 00:20:15.580
we have to train the next generation,

00:20:15.580 --> 00:20:20.580
even, you know, at the lower
grades so there is a commitment

00:20:21.730 --> 00:20:26.320
to this doing of science,
to discover truth,

00:20:26.320 --> 00:20:28.690
that you know even in
the very young grades,

00:20:28.690 --> 00:20:30.240
we have to develop the skills there

00:20:30.240 --> 00:20:32.930
so people can go to high
school, and then go to college,

00:20:32.930 --> 00:20:35.070
and then, if they choose, go get a PhD

00:20:35.070 --> 00:20:38.800
but on the other hand, you
know, the political currents

00:20:38.800 --> 00:20:42.930
are really calling that
into question, you know,

00:20:42.930 --> 00:20:47.070
around issues, not directly
related to what you do,

00:20:47.070 --> 00:20:51.030
I'm just curious, as a
scientist, what your thoughts

00:20:51.030 --> 00:20:52.100
are about that.

00:20:52.100 --> 00:20:57.100
How do we be build a legitimacy of science

00:20:57.790 --> 00:21:01.720
in those communities where
it's become problematic.

00:21:01.720 --> 00:21:04.170
- I wish I could answer that.

00:21:04.170 --> 00:21:09.050
I'm sure that a lot of the
development of a scientist

00:21:09.050 --> 00:21:12.500
takes place in public
schools in the lower grades.

00:21:12.500 --> 00:21:14.930
I have no idea how that's best done.

00:21:14.930 --> 00:21:17.550
Of course so much of it depends
on the home environment.

00:21:17.550 --> 00:21:21.220
I was so lucky, although I
didn't learn much in the way

00:21:21.220 --> 00:21:23.830
of formal science until university,

00:21:23.830 --> 00:21:25.650
I was so lucky in having parents

00:21:25.650 --> 00:21:27.880
that allowed me to build things.

00:21:27.880 --> 00:21:29.450
I could make a mess in the backyard,

00:21:29.450 --> 00:21:30.500
and they didn't care.

00:21:32.820 --> 00:21:34.470
I have taught all my life,

00:21:34.470 --> 00:21:37.750
but I must say I hold
in awe those teachers

00:21:37.750 --> 00:21:42.510
in public schools for the much
deeper challenge they have.

00:21:42.510 --> 00:21:45.353
After all, when I teach,
I'm talking to the choir.

00:21:46.400 --> 00:21:48.590
If the class is a little unruly,

00:21:48.590 --> 00:21:51.688
I lower my voice and they all settle down.

00:21:51.688 --> 00:21:53.294
(Harry laughing)

00:21:53.294 --> 00:21:55.930
It's just so different,

00:21:55.930 --> 00:21:59.230
but of course once we've got
these people in university,

00:21:59.230 --> 00:22:02.100
then indeed there are
things that can be done

00:22:02.100 --> 00:22:05.020
and must be done to keep them on the track

00:22:05.020 --> 00:22:06.563
to doing great things,

00:22:07.470 --> 00:22:10.170
and one of the most important certainly

00:22:10.170 --> 00:22:14.310
is a little bit of support
for interesting new research

00:22:14.310 --> 00:22:16.400
that will inspire them,

00:22:16.400 --> 00:22:19.670
perhaps to continue doing
research after education,

00:22:19.670 --> 00:22:21.210
or perhaps to go into something different

00:22:21.210 --> 00:22:22.543
but apply their skills.

00:22:23.810 --> 00:22:26.070
Not very expensive as a
fraction of the budget

00:22:26.070 --> 00:22:28.580
of this country to keep research going.

00:22:28.580 --> 00:22:30.643
It's being squeezed these days.

00:22:31.610 --> 00:22:34.650
For small groups, the
National Science Foundation

00:22:34.650 --> 00:22:37.860
is a major source of support.

00:22:37.860 --> 00:22:42.860
It is being terribly squeezed
so that many scientists

00:22:42.950 --> 00:22:44.490
who are doing small science,

00:22:44.490 --> 00:22:46.410
but that's so, but that's the backbone,

00:22:46.410 --> 00:22:48.640
the small science groups that
are teaching small groups

00:22:48.640 --> 00:22:52.230
of students to go out and
do wonderful new things,

00:22:52.230 --> 00:22:54.190
are being squeezed to the point that many

00:22:54.190 --> 00:22:55.770
are closing down.

00:22:55.770 --> 00:22:59.150
The National Science Foundation
is running out of money

00:22:59.150 --> 00:23:04.150
for small groups that are at
the very basis for education.

00:23:05.560 --> 00:23:07.730
- I would like to change directions now,

00:23:07.730 --> 00:23:12.730
and have you help me make
our audience understand,

00:23:15.210 --> 00:23:18.410
maybe they already do but
let's start from beginning.

00:23:18.410 --> 00:23:19.950
You are a cosmologist.

00:23:19.950 --> 00:23:24.950
What is it that this field of
the physical sciences studies?

00:23:26.920 --> 00:23:29.010
- The easy answer is the Universe,

00:23:29.010 --> 00:23:30.730
but of course it's also the wrong answer.

00:23:30.730 --> 00:23:31.780
The Universe is everything.

00:23:31.780 --> 00:23:34.080
I don't study you
(Harry chuckles)

00:23:34.080 --> 00:23:35.145
So when I say I'm studying--

00:23:35.145 --> 00:23:35.978
(both laughing)

00:23:35.978 --> 00:23:36.960
Yeah, I'm shocked! (laughing)

00:23:36.960 --> 00:23:38.480
I'll try to work you in,

00:23:38.480 --> 00:23:40.620
but when I say I'm studying the Universe,

00:23:40.620 --> 00:23:43.700
I really mean I'm
studying what the Universe

00:23:43.700 --> 00:23:46.403
looks like on the
largest observable scale.

00:23:47.440 --> 00:23:50.410
It's a little surprising that
I could make such a statement.

00:23:50.410 --> 00:23:52.873
How do I know there's a
largest observable scale?

00:23:54.250 --> 00:23:57.560
To be a little more
explicit then I should say

00:23:57.560 --> 00:24:00.740
we observe that matter is arranged

00:24:00.740 --> 00:24:02.760
in a sort of hierarchy of structures.

00:24:02.760 --> 00:24:05.270
You and I are a little
concentration of material

00:24:05.270 --> 00:24:09.600
here in the sprawl of the
Bay area on the planet Earth,

00:24:09.600 --> 00:24:11.620
that's in the solar system,

00:24:11.620 --> 00:24:13.240
that's in a galaxy of stars,

00:24:13.240 --> 00:24:16.460
it's in a super cluster
of stars, and so on.

00:24:16.460 --> 00:24:18.780
Layer upon layer of structure.

00:24:18.780 --> 00:24:19.950
It's kind of a neat arrangement,

00:24:19.950 --> 00:24:22.253
and of course it goes down in size too.

00:24:23.150 --> 00:24:27.320
But what is striking is that as you look

00:24:27.320 --> 00:24:29.110
on successively larger scales,

00:24:29.110 --> 00:24:32.520
you reach a point where
there is no more structure.

00:24:32.520 --> 00:24:36.530
The distribution of material
objects becomes uniform.

00:24:36.530 --> 00:24:39.323
No center that we can see, no edge.

00:24:40.230 --> 00:24:43.180
It's that wonderfully simple arrangement

00:24:43.180 --> 00:24:45.430
that is the basis for what we study

00:24:45.430 --> 00:24:48.130
when we're studying the
large-scale structure

00:24:48.130 --> 00:24:49.700
of the Universe.

00:24:49.700 --> 00:24:52.630
What is the nature of that
large-scale distribution,

00:24:52.630 --> 00:24:55.060
and what it is its behavior?

00:24:55.060 --> 00:24:58.180
It's been speculated for a long time,

00:24:58.180 --> 00:25:02.570
fairly recently demonstrated,
that this uniform distribution

00:25:02.570 --> 00:25:04.643
is nearly uniformly expanding.

00:25:05.960 --> 00:25:09.470
It contains fossils
from the early Universe,

00:25:09.470 --> 00:25:11.080
in particular, thermal radiation.

00:25:11.080 --> 00:25:12.483
The radiation is cooling.

00:25:15.120 --> 00:25:20.120
It is observed that distant
galaxies look younger,

00:25:20.650 --> 00:25:21.540
and that makes sense,

00:25:21.540 --> 00:25:23.830
because we're seeing them
as they were in the past

00:25:23.830 --> 00:25:26.260
because of the limited light travel time,

00:25:26.260 --> 00:25:28.240
We're seeing evolution.

00:25:28.240 --> 00:25:30.520
We're seeing the growth of departures

00:25:30.520 --> 00:25:32.600
from this large scale uniformity,

00:25:32.600 --> 00:25:35.860
matter is growing together in clumps,

00:25:35.860 --> 00:25:38.990
and the clumps are growing
together in clumps of clumps.

00:25:38.990 --> 00:25:42.620
We are studying the
growth of the big levels

00:25:42.620 --> 00:25:44.363
in this hierarchy of structure.

00:25:47.350 --> 00:25:52.350
- And is the concern, only peripherally,

00:25:53.880 --> 00:25:56.030
how it all started?

00:25:56.030 --> 00:25:58.770
- Oh, of course you'd love
to answer that question.

00:25:58.770 --> 00:26:02.360
You make it peripheral if you
can't give it a good answer,

00:26:02.360 --> 00:26:05.700
and it's debated whether
we have a good answer.

00:26:05.700 --> 00:26:10.550
To me, as an old-fashioned
theory and observation type guy,

00:26:10.550 --> 00:26:13.420
we don't have yet a definitive answer.

00:26:13.420 --> 00:26:17.400
We have some very good ideas
that people are working hard on

00:26:17.400 --> 00:26:20.600
and, remarkably enough,
they're developing tests,

00:26:20.600 --> 00:26:24.760
perhaps clues to, what
was the Universe doing

00:26:24.760 --> 00:26:26.450
before it was expanding.

00:26:26.450 --> 00:26:30.890
That's the next great
generation of experiments

00:26:30.890 --> 00:26:33.470
in this subject.

00:26:33.470 --> 00:26:36.540
There are ideas, as I said,
about what the Universe

00:26:36.540 --> 00:26:38.130
was doing before it was expanding.

00:26:38.130 --> 00:26:40.740
They go under the name of inflation.

00:26:40.740 --> 00:26:42.960
Inflation is not a theory

00:26:42.960 --> 00:26:46.100
because there are so
many options within it,

00:26:46.100 --> 00:26:48.583
so many hypotheses to
be made and considered.

00:26:49.490 --> 00:26:51.573
So, so far we don't have any firm,

00:26:53.100 --> 00:26:56.670
oh we have very few firm
predictions out of inflation

00:26:57.530 --> 00:26:59.440
and unfortunately most
of these predictions

00:26:59.440 --> 00:27:02.161
were in effect post-dictions.

00:27:02.161 --> 00:27:05.473
The theory constructed to fit
ideas that are now confirmed.

00:27:06.609 --> 00:27:09.540
But they could change,
things will show up.

00:27:09.540 --> 00:27:11.200
Search for gravitational waves

00:27:11.200 --> 00:27:13.100
that would have been
generated by processes

00:27:13.100 --> 00:27:15.380
thought to have happened during inflation.

00:27:15.380 --> 00:27:17.690
Gravity wave detectors are being designed,

00:27:17.690 --> 00:27:19.900
and not only will it
see interesting things

00:27:19.900 --> 00:27:22.210
produced in the Universe as it is now,

00:27:22.210 --> 00:27:25.240
maybe they'll see some
fossils from the Universe

00:27:25.240 --> 00:27:29.453
when it was not describable
by an expanding world model.

00:27:30.397 --> 00:27:32.140
- In your lecture yesterday,

00:27:32.140 --> 00:27:37.140
you talked about certain
things that we know.

00:27:37.240 --> 00:27:40.330
I don't, I want to be true
to use the right term,

00:27:40.330 --> 00:27:44.450
but laws or principles of the uniformity,

00:27:44.450 --> 00:27:45.880
no center, no edge.

00:27:45.880 --> 00:27:47.800
I mean, these were the ideas

00:27:47.800 --> 00:27:50.330
that have motivated the research,

00:27:50.330 --> 00:27:53.360
and have been proved in a way.

00:27:53.360 --> 00:27:55.320
You just mentioned that the Universe

00:27:55.320 --> 00:27:57.767
is expanding but not evolving--

00:27:58.888 --> 00:28:00.125
- [James] But evolving.

00:28:00.125 --> 00:28:01.420
- [Both] And evolving!

00:28:01.420 --> 00:28:03.730
- Yeah, yeah, and evolving, sorry.

00:28:03.730 --> 00:28:04.563
- [James] Yeah, that's key.

00:28:04.563 --> 00:28:06.883
You know there was a steady state model.

00:28:07.830 --> 00:28:10.712
I like it as an example of an elegant idea

00:28:10.712 --> 00:28:12.920
that has been ruled out.

00:28:12.920 --> 00:28:16.640
We often, you know, in
in formulating ideas

00:28:16.640 --> 00:28:18.330
about how the Universe around us,

00:28:18.330 --> 00:28:19.730
the world around us, may be operating,

00:28:19.730 --> 00:28:22.063
we do rely on our notions of elegance,

00:28:23.180 --> 00:28:24.570
but of course our notions of elegance

00:28:24.570 --> 00:28:27.203
are really strongly
informed by what works,

00:28:28.620 --> 00:28:31.420
but the steady-state cosmology

00:28:31.420 --> 00:28:36.040
is an example of an elegant
idea that was very influential,

00:28:36.040 --> 00:28:37.810
drove a lot of research in part

00:28:37.810 --> 00:28:40.133
because it's so infuriated some people.

00:28:41.790 --> 00:28:45.710
Advanced the subject but then
was shown to be totally wrong.

00:28:45.710 --> 00:28:47.640
So goodbye elegant idea,

00:28:47.640 --> 00:28:49.473
let's look for another elegant idea.

00:28:50.720 --> 00:28:52.600
I interrupted you a bit there you were--

00:28:52.600 --> 00:28:54.400
- Well I know but I'm glad,

00:28:54.400 --> 00:28:58.010
but going what I guess what
I wanted to talk a little

00:28:58.010 --> 00:29:02.870
about some of the the
concepts that have emerged.

00:29:02.870 --> 00:29:05.005
In your lecture, you were talking

00:29:05.005 --> 00:29:10.005
about thermal radiation,
dark matter, dark energy,

00:29:10.550 --> 00:29:15.550
and in your lecture, you
really conveyed the sense

00:29:15.710 --> 00:29:19.790
of how our understanding
of these terms emerged

00:29:19.790 --> 00:29:24.790
over time through generations
as scientists had an idea

00:29:26.040 --> 00:29:28.910
which was either confirmed to disconfirmed

00:29:28.910 --> 00:29:30.880
by satellite observations.

00:29:30.880 --> 00:29:32.840
So, give us a feel for that,

00:29:32.840 --> 00:29:35.440
so people can have a little
taste of that lecture.

00:29:35.440 --> 00:29:37.880
- Okay, let us choose an example.

00:29:37.880 --> 00:29:41.030
Well first let's notice that
you and I are made of atoms.

00:29:41.030 --> 00:29:44.180
They go on under the
general name of baryonic,

00:29:44.180 --> 00:29:45.970
bary being heavy,

00:29:45.970 --> 00:29:49.060
well, historical term.

00:29:49.060 --> 00:29:53.320
We are made of material
that is, to us, visible.

00:29:53.320 --> 00:29:56.150
The striking evidence we have
from studying the property

00:29:56.150 --> 00:29:57.230
of the Universe in the large

00:29:57.230 --> 00:29:59.160
is that you, and I,
and baryons in general,

00:29:59.160 --> 00:30:01.250
make up only five percent or so

00:30:01.250 --> 00:30:03.400
of the mass of the Universe.

00:30:03.400 --> 00:30:04.630
A little shocking.
- Yeah.

00:30:04.630 --> 00:30:06.580
- But we'll have to live with it.

00:30:06.580 --> 00:30:09.830
Pretty convincing evidence
that there is dark matter

00:30:09.830 --> 00:30:11.120
that is not baryonic,

00:30:11.120 --> 00:30:14.780
and whose properties
are really mysterious.

00:30:14.780 --> 00:30:16.310
That there must be this stuff

00:30:16.310 --> 00:30:18.210
was known already in the 1930s.

00:30:18.210 --> 00:30:20.720
I mentioned Fritz
Zwicky, one of my heroes.

00:30:20.720 --> 00:30:23.020
He was the first to point
out that we have a puzzle.

00:30:23.020 --> 00:30:26.443
There's mass out there
that is not baryonic.

00:30:27.370 --> 00:30:28.750
There are great searches going on,

00:30:28.750 --> 00:30:31.340
including one beautiful
project headed up here

00:30:31.340 --> 00:30:33.727
in Berkeley by Bernard Sadoulet,

00:30:33.727 --> 00:30:38.600
looking for this dark matter
through laboratory searches,

00:30:38.600 --> 00:30:40.370
brilliant stuff.

00:30:40.370 --> 00:30:42.310
Then fascinating to me particularly

00:30:42.310 --> 00:30:46.333
is the third major component
of our Universe, dark energy.

00:30:47.230 --> 00:30:49.230
The name is really meaningless,

00:30:49.230 --> 00:30:50.840
it was ad hoc, made up,

00:30:50.840 --> 00:30:53.913
but it fits with dark energy, dark matter.

00:30:55.360 --> 00:30:58.690
It had its origins already back in 1917

00:30:58.690 --> 00:31:01.430
when Einstein had invented
his new theory of gravity,

00:31:01.430 --> 00:31:03.330
general relativity, and found that

00:31:03.330 --> 00:31:05.590
when he applied it to the Universe,

00:31:05.590 --> 00:31:07.360
it gave an absurd answer.

00:31:07.360 --> 00:31:09.810
The Universe can't be stable.

00:31:09.810 --> 00:31:11.420
Of course the Universe is forever!

00:31:11.420 --> 00:31:16.170
And so he adjusted his theory
by postulating a new term

00:31:16.170 --> 00:31:17.750
that we now call dark energy.

00:31:17.750 --> 00:31:20.603
He called it the cosmic constant.

00:31:22.370 --> 00:31:25.180
It was a Belgian, George Lemaitre,

00:31:25.180 --> 00:31:28.220
in the late 1920s early 1930s,

00:31:28.220 --> 00:31:32.150
who recognized that
Einstein's cosmic constant

00:31:32.150 --> 00:31:35.860
acts like a zero level of energy.

00:31:35.860 --> 00:31:40.160
You know, in physics, energy is a quantity

00:31:40.160 --> 00:31:43.020
whose differences we
care about, transactions,

00:31:43.020 --> 00:31:45.610
but we don't ever set a zero of energy.

00:31:45.610 --> 00:31:49.020
He became convinced that
the zero level of energy

00:31:49.020 --> 00:31:51.503
is set by Einstein's cosmic constant.

00:31:52.790 --> 00:31:55.270
I showed in my lecture
a fascinating exchange

00:31:55.270 --> 00:31:57.670
of letters between Lemaitre and Einstein

00:31:57.670 --> 00:32:00.230
just after the second world war,

00:32:00.230 --> 00:32:02.600
in which Lemaitre tried
to convince Einstein

00:32:02.600 --> 00:32:04.510
of the value of this concept.

00:32:04.510 --> 00:32:06.670
Einstein would have nothing of it.

00:32:06.670 --> 00:32:09.870
He grew to hate the cosmic constant

00:32:09.870 --> 00:32:12.550
because he didn't think it was needed,

00:32:12.550 --> 00:32:15.410
and if not needed then away with it.

00:32:15.410 --> 00:32:18.350
To Einstein, simplicity is all.

00:32:18.350 --> 00:32:21.583
I did remark that other
great scientists of that era,

00:32:23.530 --> 00:32:27.410
Wolfgang Pauli, brilliant,
brilliant person,

00:32:27.410 --> 00:32:29.750
would have nothing to do with lambda.

00:32:29.750 --> 00:32:32.830
Evgeny Lifshitz from the Soviet Union,

00:32:32.830 --> 00:32:37.430
a magnificent series of
textbooks in theoretical physics.

00:32:37.430 --> 00:32:39.440
All of us learned so much from them.

00:32:39.440 --> 00:32:41.420
They would have nothing to do with lambda.

00:32:41.420 --> 00:32:42.320
- [Harry] And lambda is?

00:32:42.320 --> 00:32:43.153
- Oh, sorry!

00:32:43.153 --> 00:32:44.570
Lambda is dark energy,

00:32:44.570 --> 00:32:47.440
it is the matrix dark energy,

00:32:47.440 --> 00:32:49.410
it is Einstein's cosmic constant.

00:32:49.410 --> 00:32:50.940
- [Harry] Mm-hmm

00:32:50.940 --> 00:32:53.600
- To these people, it
was an ugly appendix.

00:32:53.600 --> 00:32:56.150
And they had a reason in
part for thinking that

00:32:56.150 --> 00:33:00.270
because we have the horrible
problem in quantum physics

00:33:00.270 --> 00:33:03.690
that zero-point energy
is real and important,

00:33:03.690 --> 00:33:07.870
and it's there and it exists
not only in material objects,

00:33:07.870 --> 00:33:11.270
but in fields such as the
electromagnetic field,

00:33:11.270 --> 00:33:14.020
but on an eve sum of the zero-point energy

00:33:14.020 --> 00:33:15.760
belonging to the electromagnetic field

00:33:15.760 --> 00:33:16.830
and other fields of nature

00:33:16.830 --> 00:33:20.560
gives you an absurd energy density.

00:33:20.560 --> 00:33:23.440
With all of the properties of dark energy,

00:33:23.440 --> 00:33:26.870
Einstein's cosmic constant except one,

00:33:26.870 --> 00:33:30.710
its numerical value is
ridiculous, forget about it.

00:33:30.710 --> 00:33:31.840
There must be something wrong

00:33:31.840 --> 00:33:34.410
with zero-point energy for fields.

00:33:34.410 --> 00:33:35.710
I know of nothing wrong with,

00:33:35.710 --> 00:33:37.500
the argument is I think clean,

00:33:37.500 --> 00:33:38.990
except the answer is absurd.

00:33:38.990 --> 00:33:42.590
It's an illustration of how
we have, on the one hand,

00:33:42.590 --> 00:33:45.060
a secure, well-tested theory,

00:33:45.060 --> 00:33:47.550
but on the other hand it's
only an approximation.

00:33:47.550 --> 00:33:50.550
There are holes to be filled
by the next generation.

00:33:50.550 --> 00:33:55.550
Well, what is now charming
is, on the one hand,

00:33:55.720 --> 00:34:00.150
people recognize there
ought to be a zero of energy

00:34:00.150 --> 00:34:03.710
that would behave like
Einsteins cosmic constant.

00:34:03.710 --> 00:34:06.780
Lemaitre's dark energy, it ought to exist,

00:34:06.780 --> 00:34:11.160
and through a series of
experiments that began again

00:34:11.160 --> 00:34:16.160
in the 1930s by Edwin Hubble
who drove the development

00:34:16.200 --> 00:34:18.610
of a big telescope to
make the measurements,

00:34:18.610 --> 00:34:22.220
the 200-inch telescope on Mount Palomar,

00:34:22.220 --> 00:34:23.653
by great scientists in the 60s

00:34:23.653 --> 00:34:26.130
when that telescope was at last finished,

00:34:26.130 --> 00:34:28.030
in particular Allan Sandage,

00:34:29.160 --> 00:34:31.850
driving forth the
observations that might check

00:34:31.850 --> 00:34:33.530
for this dark energy.

00:34:33.530 --> 00:34:38.120
Then, just in our
generation, here at Berkeley,

00:34:38.120 --> 00:34:43.120
Saul Perlmutter leading a group
to carry on those efforts,

00:34:43.140 --> 00:34:46.580
and at last succeeding and
showing us of all things,

00:34:46.580 --> 00:34:48.423
that dark energy exists.

00:34:49.400 --> 00:34:53.860
The stuff that Einstein
introduced, then discarded,

00:34:53.860 --> 00:34:56.120
that Lamaitre fought for,

00:34:56.120 --> 00:35:00.363
that many serious scientists
discarded again, is there.

00:35:01.480 --> 00:35:05.010
What a neat story.

00:35:05.010 --> 00:35:10.010
- So, in a way, over time,

00:35:11.120 --> 00:35:14.860
not in the sense of the scale of time

00:35:14.860 --> 00:35:16.500
as one looks at the whole Universe,

00:35:16.500 --> 00:35:19.670
but over time and over generations,

00:35:19.670 --> 00:35:24.500
there's this movement forward to come up

00:35:24.500 --> 00:35:27.680
with a concept that is confirmed.

00:35:27.680 --> 00:35:31.070
Now in what sense in this process

00:35:31.070 --> 00:35:32.860
does the dark energy matter?

00:35:32.860 --> 00:35:35.860
I don't mean in terms of its utility

00:35:35.860 --> 00:35:39.080
for practical things but relate that

00:35:39.080 --> 00:35:41.230
to this ongoing conversation

00:35:41.230 --> 00:35:42.758
of understanding the Universe.

00:35:42.758 --> 00:35:44.840
- Yes, here it is,

00:35:44.840 --> 00:35:46.373
the dark energy exists,

00:35:46.373 --> 00:35:50.020
we should first pause to
say that ideas don't always

00:35:50.020 --> 00:35:52.550
have the longevity of dark energy.

00:35:52.550 --> 00:35:55.470
Many ideas are thrown
out and go away forever,

00:35:55.470 --> 00:35:57.440
but some curiously survive,

00:35:57.440 --> 00:36:00.180
often in a slightly different form,

00:36:00.180 --> 00:36:01.910
but now for us at this very moment,

00:36:01.910 --> 00:36:05.420
the key point is that we have the evidence

00:36:05.420 --> 00:36:09.260
for the existence of new phenomenon

00:36:09.260 --> 00:36:12.963
that does not fit within
our ideas of basic physics.

00:36:15.340 --> 00:36:16.643
Something's wrong and we're
going to have to remedy it.

00:36:16.643 --> 00:36:17.643
- [Harry] And that's dark energy?

00:36:17.643 --> 00:36:21.780
- And that's dark energy,
its value is just wrong.

00:36:21.780 --> 00:36:24.023
Now of course there's no crisis here.

00:36:24.880 --> 00:36:26.950
There's opportunity of course,

00:36:26.950 --> 00:36:29.970
but there are lots of ideas
about how to remedy this.

00:36:29.970 --> 00:36:31.330
Down the road at Stanford,

00:36:31.330 --> 00:36:34.593
Lenny Susskind knows, in his heart,

00:36:35.780 --> 00:36:37.750
the solution to this problem.
(Harry chuckling)

00:36:37.750 --> 00:36:39.260
Others of us wonder,

00:36:39.260 --> 00:36:41.603
but that's part of the game of course.

00:36:42.440 --> 00:36:47.440
- Now in the introduction in
the program for your lecture,

00:36:47.984 --> 00:36:49.320
I'm going to read what it said,

00:36:49.320 --> 00:36:51.440
and then I want you to
tell me what this means.

00:36:51.440 --> 00:36:54.090
It says peoples laid the foundation

00:36:54.090 --> 00:36:57.980
for the many modern
cosmological investigations

00:36:57.980 --> 00:37:02.980
by predicting the existence of
cosmic background radiation,

00:37:04.090 --> 00:37:07.700
popularizing the notion of
dark matter in the Universe.

00:37:07.700 --> 00:37:08.533
What does that mean?

00:37:08.533 --> 00:37:11.720
- Well it mean, with all due respect,

00:37:11.720 --> 00:37:12.590
it isn't quite right.

00:37:12.590 --> 00:37:15.957
- [Harry] Okay, let's correct
the program right now.

00:37:15.957 --> 00:37:20.260
- This radiation, of
course, was first understood

00:37:20.260 --> 00:37:22.530
before the second world war

00:37:22.530 --> 00:37:26.580
by Richard Tolman at Caltech.

00:37:26.580 --> 00:37:29.750
After the war, my teacher
Bob Dicke was the one

00:37:29.750 --> 00:37:32.380
who said maybe there's this radiation,

00:37:32.380 --> 00:37:33.580
we ought to look for it.

00:37:37.130 --> 00:37:39.810
At that time, he persuaded two young guys

00:37:39.810 --> 00:37:42.270
to build the instrument along the lines

00:37:42.270 --> 00:37:44.270
he had invented during the war,

00:37:44.270 --> 00:37:46.380
to look for this radiation.

00:37:46.380 --> 00:37:47.660
We should just remind ourself

00:37:47.660 --> 00:37:50.800
that it is radiation that fills space,

00:37:50.800 --> 00:37:53.570
that pretty unambiguously was produced

00:37:53.570 --> 00:37:55.060
when the Universe was young.

00:37:55.060 --> 00:37:57.300
Has all the properties
of thermal radiation

00:37:57.300 --> 00:37:59.460
that it could only have
acquired those properties

00:37:59.460 --> 00:38:02.300
when the Universe was
young, and dense, and hot.

00:38:02.300 --> 00:38:03.637
He said to me, "Go think

00:38:03.637 --> 00:38:06.770
"about the theoretical considerations."

00:38:06.770 --> 00:38:08.103
That set my career.

00:38:09.770 --> 00:38:12.990
Some of the considerations I
invented were reinventions,

00:38:12.990 --> 00:38:14.600
others were new.

00:38:14.600 --> 00:38:19.600
So yeah, I guess I can
claim I did set the basis

00:38:20.320 --> 00:38:22.670
for this subject in many ways,

00:38:22.670 --> 00:38:24.930
but I certainly didn't start from scratch.

00:38:24.930 --> 00:38:27.063
No one ever does, let's face it.

00:38:28.400 --> 00:38:31.610
In particular, I was able
to do this as a postdoc

00:38:31.610 --> 00:38:34.060
because the field of study,

00:38:34.060 --> 00:38:36.920
of large-scale structure of
the Universe in the 1960s,

00:38:36.920 --> 00:38:38.313
was so small.

00:38:39.690 --> 00:38:43.350
There had been great interest
in the subject in the 30s,

00:38:43.350 --> 00:38:47.920
but by the 50s and 60s,
interest had fallen away

00:38:48.920 --> 00:38:52.250
to the point that I, as a raw postdoc,

00:38:52.250 --> 00:38:54.330
had the field much to myself.

00:38:54.330 --> 00:38:57.210
I could do all these interesting things.

00:38:57.210 --> 00:39:01.943
I wrote the book that he
mentioned in the late 60s,

00:39:02.925 --> 00:39:04.920
I think it was published '71.

00:39:04.920 --> 00:39:06.900
Lots of stuff and it is wonderful!

00:39:06.900 --> 00:39:08.260
I can do it all myself!

00:39:08.260 --> 00:39:10.870
No one, no competition.

00:39:10.870 --> 00:39:12.800
It's so different now.

00:39:12.800 --> 00:39:14.570
Of course I don't regret the old days

00:39:14.570 --> 00:39:17.060
because the subject is so much richer,

00:39:17.060 --> 00:39:19.540
but it was an amazing opportunity for me

00:39:20.450 --> 00:39:22.620
to do all of this interesting stuff

00:39:22.620 --> 00:39:24.930
without looking over my shoulder.

00:39:24.930 --> 00:39:27.740
- And, but then you,
as was said yesterday,

00:39:27.740 --> 00:39:30.090
you laid a foundation that,

00:39:30.090 --> 00:39:31.990
even if you didn't get everything right,

00:39:31.990 --> 00:39:36.990
it became the benchmark
for the development

00:39:37.100 --> 00:39:40.900
of exercises to prove that
there was physical evidence

00:39:40.900 --> 00:39:45.320
for what you were saying.
- Yes, yes, it's true.

00:39:45.320 --> 00:39:47.830
- And these were, in a
way, to make our audience,

00:39:47.830 --> 00:39:49.452
I think you use the term fossils,

00:39:49.452 --> 00:39:54.452
this cosmic background
radiation were like fossils.

00:39:55.700 --> 00:39:56.533
- [James] Yes, that's right.

00:39:56.533 --> 00:39:57.773
- [Harry] For the people in your field.

00:39:58.990 --> 00:40:01.380
- Since the Universe is not forever,

00:40:01.380 --> 00:40:02.230
it was different,

00:40:02.230 --> 00:40:03.930
it must have left evidence of that,

00:40:03.930 --> 00:40:07.440
and one fossil is this thermal radiation.

00:40:07.440 --> 00:40:09.520
I talked about lots of others in the book,

00:40:09.520 --> 00:40:10.840
and about lots of puzzles.

00:40:10.840 --> 00:40:12.690
For example, it was clear even then

00:40:12.690 --> 00:40:15.920
that there's something wrong
with our reckoning of mass.

00:40:15.920 --> 00:40:19.200
I mentioned Zwicky and his mass anomalies.

00:40:19.200 --> 00:40:22.560
I, in the book, collected many of these.

00:40:22.560 --> 00:40:26.980
In part, I was simply
collecting bits and pieces

00:40:26.980 --> 00:40:28.830
of evidence that some people knew,

00:40:28.830 --> 00:40:32.070
but weren't realizing they
ought to tell other people.

00:40:32.070 --> 00:40:33.850
- [Harry] Mm-hmm.

00:40:33.850 --> 00:40:38.470
- Methods of analysis of
large-scale structure,

00:40:38.470 --> 00:40:40.070
there were many things to be invented,

00:40:40.070 --> 00:40:42.503
so well, what could I do, I invented them.

00:40:43.880 --> 00:40:47.350
Analysis of the degree
to which the clustering

00:40:47.350 --> 00:40:50.379
exists and is evolving.

00:40:50.379 --> 00:40:51.940
The growth of mass clustering,

00:40:51.940 --> 00:40:54.640
of course is key to our ideas
about large-scale structure,

00:40:54.640 --> 00:40:56.740
because we are forced into this notion

00:40:57.580 --> 00:40:59.200
that the galaxies are not forever.

00:40:59.200 --> 00:41:00.980
When the Universe was
young, and dense, and hot,

00:41:00.980 --> 00:41:03.430
there weren't any, and
there weren't any stars.

00:41:03.430 --> 00:41:05.803
They grew through the
action mainly of gravity.

00:41:06.780 --> 00:41:08.870
And the analysis of how that would happen

00:41:08.870 --> 00:41:12.510
was certainly a large part of the book,

00:41:12.510 --> 00:41:15.853
and of course there's
now almost an industry.

00:41:17.282 --> 00:41:21.280
- Tell us a little about
either one of these discoveries

00:41:21.280 --> 00:41:22.710
or this particular publication,

00:41:22.710 --> 00:41:27.710
what your feelings were as
you came upon these ideas.

00:41:29.410 --> 00:41:32.840
You've just suggested that a
lot of this had come before,

00:41:32.840 --> 00:41:35.160
you were putting it together.

00:41:35.160 --> 00:41:36.960
It was an uncrowded field,

00:41:36.960 --> 00:41:38.610
so we were in the phase

00:41:38.610 --> 00:41:41.080
of people didn't see
the importance of this

00:41:41.080 --> 00:41:43.240
so you didn't have to worry about

00:41:43.240 --> 00:41:44.670
what the competitors were doing

00:41:44.670 --> 00:41:47.260
at this moment in time, and so on.

00:41:47.260 --> 00:41:52.260
I want a sense of the factors that made it

00:41:52.290 --> 00:41:54.480
possible for this to
happen on the one hand,

00:41:54.480 --> 00:41:55.410
you mentioned some,

00:41:55.410 --> 00:41:59.860
and then what your feelings
were as you were doing the work.

00:41:59.860 --> 00:42:03.316
- You know, it occurs to me
that I was a little nervous,

00:42:03.316 --> 00:42:08.130
and you might ask yourself
why is no one else

00:42:08.130 --> 00:42:09.653
working on this subject.

00:42:10.560 --> 00:42:12.593
There was a very good reason,

00:42:13.980 --> 00:42:15.930
although we had bits
and piece of evidence,

00:42:15.930 --> 00:42:17.800
they were rather scanty.

00:42:17.800 --> 00:42:19.613
This was not a subject, at the time,

00:42:19.613 --> 00:42:23.750
that was strongly supported
by observational evidence.

00:42:23.750 --> 00:42:27.250
I do recall the feeling, now,
that many of my colleagues,

00:42:27.250 --> 00:42:30.433
and my superiors, the tenured faculty,

00:42:31.450 --> 00:42:33.380
although they never discouraged me

00:42:33.380 --> 00:42:34.979
from working on this subject,

00:42:34.979 --> 00:42:38.423
I got the feeling that they
were saying better you than me.

00:42:39.570 --> 00:42:43.410
How do you know you'll make
progress in these great ideas?

00:42:43.410 --> 00:42:47.050
How do you know you'll be
able to explore the Universe

00:42:47.050 --> 00:42:48.770
at such immense distances,

00:42:48.770 --> 00:42:51.180
and make sense of it, and
be able to piece it together

00:42:51.180 --> 00:42:53.620
into a well-established theory?

00:42:53.620 --> 00:42:57.040
I had no idea how far
this subject would go

00:42:57.040 --> 00:42:59.480
when I was working on it in the 60s.

00:42:59.480 --> 00:43:03.213
In fact, to begin with, I
think I remember correctly,

00:43:04.490 --> 00:43:05.990
I thought well I'll stick with this,

00:43:05.990 --> 00:43:07.120
write a couple of papers,

00:43:07.120 --> 00:43:10.110
and then I'll do something
that makes some sense.

00:43:10.110 --> 00:43:12.830
It really was very speculative.

00:43:12.830 --> 00:43:15.070
How far could things go?

00:43:15.070 --> 00:43:19.930
In fact, I know for sure that I shied away

00:43:19.930 --> 00:43:24.643
from studies of the fossil
thermal radiation during the 70s

00:43:26.160 --> 00:43:28.930
because as it was being measured,

00:43:28.930 --> 00:43:31.610
the measurements were very difficult,

00:43:31.610 --> 00:43:34.860
and the preliminary indications
from those measurements

00:43:34.860 --> 00:43:36.960
was that this radiation didn't quite

00:43:36.960 --> 00:43:39.570
have the properties expected of it.

00:43:39.570 --> 00:43:42.920
So I went off and studied
the distribution of galaxies.

00:43:42.920 --> 00:43:46.070
It wasn't obvious at all
to me that this subject

00:43:46.070 --> 00:43:48.710
would have grown as rich as it now has.

00:43:48.710 --> 00:43:50.030
Who could tell?

00:43:50.030 --> 00:43:52.060
Technology advances.

00:43:52.060 --> 00:43:55.330
- [Harry] So risk-taking,
that's something that comes up

00:43:55.330 --> 00:43:57.210
with a lot of the scientists I interview,

00:43:57.210 --> 00:44:00.580
that you go out on an intellectual limb,

00:44:00.580 --> 00:44:01.970
I guess, one would have to say.

00:44:01.970 --> 00:44:04.010
- How else are you going
to do something new?

00:44:04.010 --> 00:44:04.843
- [Harry] Mm-hmm.

00:44:04.843 --> 00:44:06.612
- And of course the limb can always break.

00:44:06.612 --> 00:44:07.450
- Mm-hmm

00:44:08.492 --> 00:44:09.508
(talking over each other)

00:44:09.508 --> 00:44:12.208
- I must admit I don't think
I was at all being brave.

00:44:14.650 --> 00:44:16.425
Maybe I was being oblivious,

00:44:16.425 --> 00:44:17.258
(Harry laughing)

00:44:17.258 --> 00:44:20.100
but also in those times,

00:44:20.100 --> 00:44:24.530
remember this is not so long
after the second world war.

00:44:24.530 --> 00:44:28.950
Education was ramping up
after the hiatus of the war.

00:44:28.950 --> 00:44:30.633
Faculty were being hired,

00:44:31.620 --> 00:44:33.703
although it's true I wasn't
offered any other job

00:44:33.703 --> 00:44:34.913
than at Princeton,

00:44:36.180 --> 00:44:38.410
somehow there was a
feeling I could get a job

00:44:38.410 --> 00:44:40.030
if I needed it.

00:44:40.030 --> 00:44:42.890
That's not so much the case anymore,

00:44:42.890 --> 00:44:47.620
and it is a serious point of
concern for a young scientist.

00:44:47.620 --> 00:44:50.400
Am I going to be able
to continue my career?

00:44:50.400 --> 00:44:54.953
That's a real burden added
on to all the other things

00:44:57.180 --> 00:44:58.710
you've placed on the limb.

00:44:58.710 --> 00:45:00.400
I'm on the limb, I'm doing good work,

00:45:00.400 --> 00:45:03.600
but the balloon breaks
because they can't find a job.

00:45:03.600 --> 00:45:06.157
That is a real concern
that didn't occupy me,

00:45:06.157 --> 00:45:09.310
and I think, although I don't
think I ever thought about it,

00:45:09.310 --> 00:45:10.300
it was for good reason,

00:45:10.300 --> 00:45:11.453
there were jobs.

00:45:13.550 --> 00:45:15.947
Yes, but no, risk taking--

00:45:15.947 --> 00:45:19.170
[Harry] And you mentioned
in your lecture a postdoc

00:45:19.170 --> 00:45:20.287
whose name I don't remember,

00:45:20.287 --> 00:45:22.680
who committed early in his career

00:45:22.680 --> 00:45:24.480
to the development of the COBE satellite,

00:45:24.480 --> 00:45:25.730
which became--
- Yes.

00:45:25.730 --> 00:45:26.750
Talk a little about that,

00:45:26.750 --> 00:45:29.910
because that was crucial
for providing the evidence

00:45:29.910 --> 00:45:31.823
for some of these theories
that we've been talking about.

00:45:31.823 --> 00:45:34.420
- Yes, I mentioned during the 70's,

00:45:34.420 --> 00:45:38.010
the apparent evidence for anomalies

00:45:38.010 --> 00:45:39.760
that didn't make too much sense.

00:45:39.760 --> 00:45:42.040
That didn't make sense.

00:45:42.040 --> 00:45:44.210
It was obvious what to be done,

00:45:44.210 --> 00:45:46.400
build a satellite devoted
to the measurement

00:45:46.400 --> 00:45:48.760
above the atmosphere where the observing

00:45:48.760 --> 00:45:50.610
is much clearer.

00:45:50.610 --> 00:45:52.110
There was a young postdoc,

00:45:52.110 --> 00:45:56.333
a student of Paul
Richards here at Berkeley,

00:45:57.280 --> 00:46:01.130
the graduate student
learned a lot from Paul,

00:46:01.130 --> 00:46:03.540
then moved to the East Coast.

00:46:03.540 --> 00:46:05.100
This is John Mather,

00:46:05.100 --> 00:46:07.580
and as a postdoc decided he would love

00:46:07.580 --> 00:46:10.100
to build the satellite
that could do the job

00:46:10.100 --> 00:46:13.050
of studying this radiation
above the atmosphere.

00:46:13.050 --> 00:46:15.990
As a postdoc, he recruited the help

00:46:15.990 --> 00:46:17.890
of some of the major people in the field,

00:46:17.890 --> 00:46:22.200
my dear colleague David
Wilkinson, a few others.

00:46:22.200 --> 00:46:26.070
They got together, proposed
to NASA to build a satellite,

00:46:26.070 --> 00:46:28.080
the proposal was accepted,

00:46:28.080 --> 00:46:32.490
and Mather as a postdoc
stepped into the position

00:46:32.490 --> 00:46:36.540
of lead scientist at NASA

00:46:36.540 --> 00:46:39.000
to direct the building of this thing.

00:46:39.000 --> 00:46:40.770
It's a very difficult job.

00:46:40.770 --> 00:46:44.330
He has not only to understand
the technology and the science

00:46:44.330 --> 00:46:47.530
but also to hold off all the bureaucrats

00:46:47.530 --> 00:46:50.170
who want, for example,
to take away engineers

00:46:50.170 --> 00:46:51.200
working on his project,

00:46:51.200 --> 00:46:53.630
and put them on to some other satellite.

00:46:53.630 --> 00:46:55.660
He has a marvelous book,

00:46:55.660 --> 00:46:58.160
The Very First Light I think it's called,

00:46:58.160 --> 00:47:01.920
in which he details the
agony as well as the ecstasy

00:47:01.920 --> 00:47:03.850
of building such a thing.

00:47:03.850 --> 00:47:06.850
Chapter after chapter of emergencies,

00:47:06.850 --> 00:47:08.163
and who I turned to.

00:47:11.570 --> 00:47:14.463
15 years of such work,

00:47:15.390 --> 00:47:19.040
he is now approaching middle life,

00:47:19.040 --> 00:47:22.620
and he has not a large record
of academic accomplishments.

00:47:22.620 --> 00:47:25.460
It's all his eggs are in this one basket.

00:47:25.460 --> 00:47:28.710
He has a deep respect
of a handful of people

00:47:28.710 --> 00:47:29.930
who know what's going on,

00:47:29.930 --> 00:47:34.380
but if that rocket had exploded on launch

00:47:34.380 --> 00:47:36.670
and it happens.
- Mm-hmm.

00:47:36.670 --> 00:47:37.803
- Where is his career?

00:47:39.270 --> 00:47:40.423
Brave man.

00:47:43.310 --> 00:47:47.110
- Where do you see the
the most exciting problems

00:47:47.110 --> 00:47:49.560
down the road for this field,

00:47:49.560 --> 00:47:53.510
and in what body of theories
will be most instrumental

00:47:53.510 --> 00:47:56.253
in pointing the way which would
then have to be confirmed.

00:47:56.253 --> 00:47:59.980
- Yes, yes, of course
it's always controversial.

00:47:59.980 --> 00:48:02.220
Different people have
very different opinions.

00:48:02.220 --> 00:48:05.210
Some will say cosmology is getting dull,

00:48:05.210 --> 00:48:06.910
we've answered the main questions,

00:48:09.060 --> 00:48:13.070
but I don't understand why they say that.

00:48:13.070 --> 00:48:14.260
Well, perhaps I do.

00:48:14.260 --> 00:48:16.510
We have answered some big questions.

00:48:16.510 --> 00:48:19.110
Is dark energy really there, yes.

00:48:19.110 --> 00:48:20.803
Is dark matter there, yes,

00:48:22.690 --> 00:48:25.090
but what are these things?

00:48:25.090 --> 00:48:29.720
And so we have right
in our face, up close,

00:48:29.720 --> 00:48:31.513
big open questions.

00:48:33.580 --> 00:48:35.183
Will we be able to answer them?

00:48:36.070 --> 00:48:38.070
Time only will tell.

00:48:38.070 --> 00:48:41.710
But of course there are
other directions to go,

00:48:41.710 --> 00:48:44.840
and they are not necessarily
along the directions

00:48:44.840 --> 00:48:46.053
we've been following.

00:48:47.440 --> 00:48:52.440
For example, well, we
think we're so smart.

00:48:55.720 --> 00:48:57.520
We understand galaxies, you know,

00:48:57.520 --> 00:48:59.880
we don't understand our own galaxy.

00:48:59.880 --> 00:49:02.423
Astronomers are starting to turn back,

00:49:03.320 --> 00:49:05.550
there was a somewhat of
an imbalance in astronomy

00:49:05.550 --> 00:49:07.630
in the past decade or so,

00:49:07.630 --> 00:49:11.800
that the astronomy of the
nearby Universe was neglected

00:49:11.800 --> 00:49:14.290
in favor of the glamour of looking out

00:49:14.290 --> 00:49:16.400
to the edge of the Universe.

00:49:16.400 --> 00:49:18.330
There is a definitely fads,

00:49:18.330 --> 00:49:21.803
they operate in clothing styles
and they operate in science.

00:49:22.650 --> 00:49:26.580
And the cosmology of the nearby Universe,

00:49:26.580 --> 00:49:29.730
the science of the Universe
has studied by nearby objects,

00:49:29.730 --> 00:49:31.420
was neglected.

00:49:31.420 --> 00:49:34.640
In particular our galaxy
has been neglected.

00:49:34.640 --> 00:49:38.410
Shameful, we live here, we
oughta look into it a little.

00:49:38.410 --> 00:49:40.630
It has lots of fascinating properties

00:49:40.630 --> 00:49:43.430
that will teach us about how it formed,

00:49:43.430 --> 00:49:45.880
is teaching us about how its form,

00:49:45.880 --> 00:49:50.880
and these lessons are just
being taught to us now.

00:49:51.410 --> 00:49:54.850
So very clearly in the next ten years,

00:49:54.850 --> 00:49:59.070
there's going to be a lot
more work on nearby galaxies,

00:49:59.070 --> 00:50:01.360
studying in detail their properties

00:50:01.360 --> 00:50:05.000
and teasing out hints to how they formed,

00:50:05.000 --> 00:50:07.410
which of course is what
we attempt to understand

00:50:07.410 --> 00:50:08.830
when we look at distant galaxies

00:50:08.830 --> 00:50:10.823
seen in the past as they were forming.

00:50:12.400 --> 00:50:14.500
Clearly that's going to be a big activity.

00:50:15.650 --> 00:50:19.723
Finding nearby planetary
systems, fascinating.

00:50:20.890 --> 00:50:23.030
Finding out if any of
those planetary systems

00:50:23.030 --> 00:50:26.410
contain terrestrial planets, wow!

00:50:26.410 --> 00:50:28.900
Is there oxygen on any of them?

00:50:28.900 --> 00:50:30.453
How could you resist looking?

00:50:33.430 --> 00:50:38.070
Styles change because, in part, technology

00:50:38.070 --> 00:50:39.980
solves one set of problems,

00:50:39.980 --> 00:50:42.300
opens up others that
maybe are so difficult

00:50:42.300 --> 00:50:45.960
you will turn instead to
areas you've neglected.

00:50:45.960 --> 00:50:49.840
And one thing about astronomy,
you know, we're in no danger

00:50:49.840 --> 00:50:51.760
of running out of things to look at.

00:50:51.760 --> 00:50:53.103
It's a big Universe.

00:50:54.390 --> 00:50:57.150
- And what about bodies of theory

00:50:57.150 --> 00:51:00.450
that might be brought to
bear on these problems?

00:51:00.450 --> 00:51:04.750
Some, you know, in other
areas of the physical science?

00:51:04.750 --> 00:51:08.600
- Well you know I am particularly
taken with the puzzle

00:51:08.600 --> 00:51:12.000
of the body of theory of the dark sector,

00:51:12.000 --> 00:51:13.883
so-called dark matter, dark energy.

00:51:15.470 --> 00:51:19.320
We pause to consider that in our sector,

00:51:19.320 --> 00:51:21.940
you and I and the things
we can see readily,

00:51:21.940 --> 00:51:23.253
that interact with light.

00:51:24.150 --> 00:51:27.270
We have a set of laws of physics

00:51:27.270 --> 00:51:29.240
that are wonderfully simple.

00:51:29.240 --> 00:51:30.870
They're not all that
simple but they're pretty,

00:51:30.870 --> 00:51:33.260
you can write down the
basic laws of physics

00:51:33.260 --> 00:51:34.810
on a couple of sheets of paper.

00:51:36.950 --> 00:51:40.490
Its expression is
spectacularly complicated.

00:51:40.490 --> 00:51:42.240
As far as we know you operate according

00:51:42.240 --> 00:51:43.593
to the laws of physics,

00:51:44.600 --> 00:51:46.370
at least to a good approximation

00:51:46.370 --> 00:51:48.320
to the known laws of physics.

00:51:48.320 --> 00:51:51.010
You are a spectacularly complex expression

00:51:51.010 --> 00:51:52.523
of a simple set of laws.

00:51:53.530 --> 00:51:55.810
In the dark sector, the laws of physics

00:51:55.810 --> 00:51:59.600
as we now postulate them
are so amazingly simple,

00:51:59.600 --> 00:52:01.363
but their expression is simple.

00:52:02.230 --> 00:52:03.123
They're dull.

00:52:04.090 --> 00:52:08.210
The dark matter piles up into
what we call massive halos,

00:52:08.210 --> 00:52:11.910
the stuff the envelopes each galaxy.

00:52:11.910 --> 00:52:13.890
The dark energy just sits there,

00:52:13.890 --> 00:52:15.880
doesn't do much of anything at all.

00:52:15.880 --> 00:52:20.880
Is that really the way it
is, or is it the simplest,

00:52:21.131 --> 00:52:25.160
most ridiculously idealistic approximation

00:52:25.160 --> 00:52:28.343
we could get away with at a
present level of knowledge?

00:52:29.720 --> 00:52:34.220
I emotionally reject
that, strictly emotional.

00:52:34.220 --> 00:52:38.180
I say I bet you there's
a whole body of physics

00:52:38.180 --> 00:52:41.750
to be discovered that
will describe the behavior

00:52:41.750 --> 00:52:43.243
of this dark sector.

00:52:47.160 --> 00:52:50.777
Call again in 25 years and
see whether I was right.

00:52:50.777 --> 00:52:52.840
- I'm interested in that emotionally,

00:52:52.840 --> 00:52:56.230
so with that is a, let's clarify that,

00:52:56.230 --> 00:53:00.120
it's a hunch based upon where you've been,

00:53:00.120 --> 00:53:01.900
what you've seen, what you thought.

00:53:01.900 --> 00:53:02.733
Help me understand that.

00:53:02.733 --> 00:53:04.430
- Well you know let's face it,

00:53:04.430 --> 00:53:07.843
I'm asking myself have I
worked myself out of a job?

00:53:09.440 --> 00:53:12.320
Has the science of
cosmology come to an end?

00:53:12.320 --> 00:53:13.153
It's in part,

00:53:13.153 --> 00:53:17.943
by emotional I really
meant, oh my goodness, fear.

00:53:20.161 --> 00:53:23.040
Perhaps over exaggeration.

00:53:23.040 --> 00:53:27.510
Emotion, yeah, I want the
Universe to be more complicated

00:53:27.510 --> 00:53:29.413
than it is, more interesting.

00:53:30.400 --> 00:53:32.510
That's an emotion, isn't it?

00:53:32.510 --> 00:53:33.620
It's a a hope, a longing.

00:53:33.620 --> 00:53:37.140
- Yeah, yeah, it's an explanation

00:53:37.140 --> 00:53:38.443
of what drives that emotion.

00:53:38.443 --> 00:53:39.560
- Yes.
Yeah, yeah.

00:53:39.560 --> 00:53:40.610
And it makes sense.

00:53:40.610 --> 00:53:41.443
- I hope so.

00:53:41.443 --> 00:53:44.190
- Well isn't that key
to, what, the enterprise?

00:53:44.190 --> 00:53:46.140
- Yeah, I hope so.
- Yeah, yeah.

00:53:46.140 --> 00:53:49.550
Okay, one final question and
that would be if students

00:53:49.550 --> 00:53:52.990
are really grabbed by,
you know, the discussion

00:53:52.990 --> 00:53:56.240
of your career and of
these set of problems,

00:53:56.240 --> 00:54:00.083
how would you urge them to
prepare for their future

00:54:01.700 --> 00:54:06.700
in this field, build the
groundwork, so to speak?

00:54:07.410 --> 00:54:08.780
- I have no idea.

00:54:08.780 --> 00:54:10.013
I have no idea.

00:54:11.340 --> 00:54:13.980
Work hard, do your homework,

00:54:13.980 --> 00:54:16.180
but keep interested in
the world around you.

00:54:17.570 --> 00:54:19.847
- And it sounds like build things too,

00:54:19.847 --> 00:54:21.630
in your particular field.

00:54:21.630 --> 00:54:24.650
- Yes, yes, of course,
each side is different.

00:54:24.650 --> 00:54:26.400
Some people build things a lot,

00:54:26.400 --> 00:54:29.660
others don't, others have
never touched a hammer.

00:54:29.660 --> 00:54:32.670
No, there are no universal
rules that I know of,

00:54:32.670 --> 00:54:34.760
aside from do your homework,

00:54:34.760 --> 00:54:37.053
but don't get locked up in your homework.

00:54:37.053 --> 00:54:39.210
I guess that's the real trick isn't it,

00:54:39.210 --> 00:54:44.210
because you know when we
teach students in university,

00:54:46.930 --> 00:54:50.030
we set them exams in which the problems

00:54:50.030 --> 00:54:51.810
are totally artificial,

00:54:51.810 --> 00:54:54.693
because these are problems
that have solutions,

00:54:56.847 --> 00:54:58.253
and known solutions.

00:54:59.100 --> 00:55:02.420
Nothing you do in research
has a known solution.

00:55:02.420 --> 00:55:05.690
If it had a known solution,
you wouldn't be doing it.

00:55:05.690 --> 00:55:10.023
So we teach these
students the wrong thing.

00:55:11.810 --> 00:55:15.000
It often puzzles me why
are we doing it that way.

00:55:15.000 --> 00:55:18.037
Well the only answer I know
is we don't know a better one,

00:55:18.037 --> 00:55:21.010
but the real trick for
developing scientists, I believe,

00:55:21.010 --> 00:55:24.710
is not to get locked
into being totally adept

00:55:24.710 --> 00:55:27.453
at answering already
known, solved problems.

00:55:29.000 --> 00:55:32.043
Treat them as what they
are meant to be, practice.

00:55:33.600 --> 00:55:36.993
Keep your mind ready
to address the unknown.

00:55:38.160 --> 00:55:40.070
- On that note, Jim, I want to thank you

00:55:40.070 --> 00:55:44.210
for taking the time to
have this conversation

00:55:44.210 --> 00:55:47.150
and share your intellectual
odyssey with us.

00:55:47.150 --> 00:55:47.983
Thank you.

00:55:47.983 --> 00:55:49.130
- It's been a pleasure.

00:55:49.130 --> 00:55:51.100
- And thank you very much for joining us

00:55:51.100 --> 00:55:53.457
for this conversation with history.

00:55:53.457 --> 00:55:56.207
(dramatic music)
