1
00:00:00,650 --> 00:00:05,540
We feel that we're finding ourselves
in the middle of a generation. And, um,

2
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:09,940
maybe even at the beginning of an era
where we struggled to sit down and have a

3
00:00:09,980 --> 00:00:12,890
difficult conversation oftentimes,
um,

4
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:18,950
I don't believe that echo chambers force
you to interrogate your own beliefs.

5
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:22,730
Um, and censorship doesn't
foster personal growth,

6
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:26,150
but I believe that these things can only
be accomplished through conversation,

7
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:30,260
through civil discourse, which is exactly
what we're hoping to do here tonight.

8
00:00:30,350 --> 00:00:34,520
We're hoping to reestablish a culture
of conversation on this campus where

9
00:00:34,550 --> 00:00:39,260
neighbors can disagree off into
the core of their beliefs, um,

10
00:00:39,530 --> 00:00:41,060
and stand out from that conversation,

11
00:00:41,061 --> 00:00:45,470
stand up from that table and walk away
and still come together knowing that

12
00:00:45,471 --> 00:00:49,520
we're all part of the same community
that were all wildcats. Um,

13
00:00:50,150 --> 00:00:53,540
and so with that, uh, we invite
you attorney point invites you,

14
00:00:53,780 --> 00:00:56,660
everyone here from the left
of the aisle to the right,

15
00:00:56,930 --> 00:00:58,070
the front of the room to the back,

16
00:00:58,071 --> 00:01:01,130
everyone in here and outside
to join in this conversation,

17
00:01:01,430 --> 00:01:05,930
in this conversation and all conversations
moving forward to have an open mind,

18
00:01:05,990 --> 00:01:10,280
open ears in the willingness
to participate in civil
discussion. Um, with that,

19
00:01:10,310 --> 00:01:11,190
I'd like you ask,

20
00:01:11,191 --> 00:01:13,940
do you want me put your hands together
for the host of the Rubin report?

21
00:01:13,970 --> 00:01:14,760
Dave Rubin.

22
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:19,760
[inaudible]

23
00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:26,250
thank you guys. Wow. I
got to tell you guys,

24
00:01:26,251 --> 00:01:31,050
I did not think my day was going to end
up in a hockey rink when I woke up this

25
00:01:31,051 --> 00:01:35,670
morning. But here we are, uh, any hockey
fans here? We have some hockey pads.

26
00:01:36,270 --> 00:01:39,740
All right. All right.
I am wearing a cop, uh,

27
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:43,770
because it's a free speech or Banta and
you know, I know what's going to happen.

28
00:01:44,150 --> 00:01:45,780
All right.
I mean this is kind of crazy.

29
00:01:45,781 --> 00:01:48,060
First off I asked him if we're
going to do this at a hockey rink,

30
00:01:48,061 --> 00:01:50,580
can I come in on the Zamboni?
But apparently

31
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:54,510
they didn't turn any point. Doesn't
have the money for that kind of thing.

32
00:01:54,690 --> 00:01:57,360
Unfortunately.
That's tough little you guys,

33
00:01:57,390 --> 00:02:02,160
you all came out here to a hockey rink.
So listen to me talk about free speech.

34
00:02:02,190 --> 00:02:04,620
That's pretty cool. I'm very
excited. You guys put on good.

35
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:07,960
Nice.

36
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:10,810
There's more outside.
I think we have room.

37
00:02:11,770 --> 00:02:13,570
There might be a seat
back there somewhere.

38
00:02:13,571 --> 00:02:15,250
I think we could probably let anymore,

39
00:02:15,430 --> 00:02:18,350
I mean it's kind of fitting
that this is sort of how uh,

40
00:02:18,460 --> 00:02:22,000
we ended up right at a hockey rink
right now if you think about it, I mean,

41
00:02:22,001 --> 00:02:23,380
you know, uh, all the,

42
00:02:23,381 --> 00:02:26,470
all the officers and policemen
that are here securing this thing,

43
00:02:26,471 --> 00:02:28,540
these guys are doing their jobs,
doing a great job.

44
00:02:28,541 --> 00:02:29,740
Actually give them a round of applause

45
00:02:29,780 --> 00:02:34,370
for [inaudible],

46
00:02:34,510 --> 00:02:36,700
making sure that nothing
crazy going to happen.

47
00:02:36,701 --> 00:02:40,210
I guarantee you you're not gonna hear
anything remotely close to hate speech or

48
00:02:40,211 --> 00:02:40,991
anything like that.

49
00:02:40,991 --> 00:02:43,750
There actually is no such thing as hate
speech and we'll talk about that too.

50
00:02:43,751 --> 00:02:47,260
But you're not going to hear any hate
out of me. I guarantee you, uh, you know,

51
00:02:47,261 --> 00:02:52,240
Candace Irwin's who, uh, seven words
really put her on the map this week.

52
00:02:52,241 --> 00:02:57,241
I love the way Candace Owens thinks
from Kanye and just seemingly has,

53
00:02:58,630 --> 00:03:00,340
has the world.
I

54
00:03:00,370 --> 00:03:04,840
actually think, uh, putting aside what
your feelings are, I'm Kanye for a moment.

55
00:03:05,170 --> 00:03:10,170
I think that him saying that offering
a little oxygen for people that want to

56
00:03:10,541 --> 00:03:13,750
think a little bit differently,
just a little bit differently.

57
00:03:13,751 --> 00:03:18,751
If you don't want to just take democratic
dogma or leftist dog more progressive

58
00:03:18,791 --> 00:03:23,050
dogma if you don't want to take that
as the Bible, as the word from God,

59
00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:26,830
that you need a little room to think
differently and I think you guys probably

60
00:03:26,831 --> 00:03:28,900
do think a little bit differently.
I hope we have,

61
00:03:29,020 --> 00:03:31,750
I can see some interesting diversity.
The left loves diversity,

62
00:03:31,751 --> 00:03:35,890
meaning the color of your skin and your
sexuality and all that stuff and your

63
00:03:35,891 --> 00:03:38,230
gender and that's all
that's all well and fine,

64
00:03:38,231 --> 00:03:40,360
but that's actually not
the diversity that matters.

65
00:03:40,630 --> 00:03:43,030
The diversity of the matters is
what's going on in your head.

66
00:03:43,031 --> 00:03:44,650
What do you actually think,
right?

67
00:03:44,830 --> 00:03:47,200
I mean imagine if I was to look
at you guys and I can just pay.

68
00:03:47,230 --> 00:03:50,500
I mean I can look any of you and
think, all right, white guy there.

69
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:54,880
He must think that black guy there,
he must think that Asian girl there,

70
00:03:55,090 --> 00:04:00,010
she must think that that actually
is the essence of prejudice, okay?

71
00:04:00,011 --> 00:04:04,030
That is the essence of prejudice.
Prejudice, which means to prejudge.

72
00:04:04,031 --> 00:04:08,080
And if you look at someone and think
that you know what they should think

73
00:04:08,081 --> 00:04:10,780
because of the color of their skin
or their sexuality or anything else,

74
00:04:11,170 --> 00:04:14,620
you actually, you're the one that
is acting bigoted. I mean that's,

75
00:04:14,650 --> 00:04:18,310
that's actually the truth that sort of
the reverse of how it's spun these days,

76
00:04:18,580 --> 00:04:21,250
but the only way that we can
actually have conversations,

77
00:04:21,251 --> 00:04:24,250
the only way that we can actually figure
out what's going on and figure out how

78
00:04:24,251 --> 00:04:28,390
can we really talk to each other is
if you look at people as individuals,

79
00:04:28,391 --> 00:04:29,440
not as a collective,

80
00:04:29,470 --> 00:04:34,470
and this is Kinda the key to everything
that sort of wrong with society right

81
00:04:34,481 --> 00:04:38,350
now. We've somehow figured out
that if we group each other right,

82
00:04:38,351 --> 00:04:43,351
if we grew each other and we play this
really awful game of identity politics,

83
00:04:43,451 --> 00:04:47,380
that's really the reverse of everything
that this nation was founded upon.

84
00:04:47,381 --> 00:04:49,390
You know, think about this for
a second. You guys are here,

85
00:04:49,570 --> 00:04:50,770
University of New Hampshire.

86
00:04:50,771 --> 00:04:53,800
I assume most of you go to the
university or you're at a great school.

87
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:59,160
I guarantee that virtually every single
one of you have it better than your

88
00:04:59,201 --> 00:05:01,120
grandparents or your great grandparents.

89
00:05:01,180 --> 00:05:03,220
Virtually every if really think about it.

90
00:05:03,221 --> 00:05:05,890
Think about your grandparents
for a second. Think about
your great grandparents.

91
00:05:05,891 --> 00:05:06,724
Probably didn't know them.

92
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:11,530
I guarantee you what you have
at 19 2021 years old, however,

93
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:14,290
however old you are, is, is a lot better.

94
00:05:14,291 --> 00:05:18,640
It's a world better than the way they
had it. No matter what color you are,

95
00:05:18,641 --> 00:05:20,050
religion you are or anything,

96
00:05:20,530 --> 00:05:23,530
and this is what identity
politics has put us up against.

97
00:05:23,530 --> 00:05:28,530
It's placed us in this situation where
we're grouping people based on their

98
00:05:28,691 --> 00:05:31,660
immutable characteristics. So if
you're black, you should think this.

99
00:05:31,661 --> 00:05:33,910
If you're Muslim, you should
think this. If you're gay,

100
00:05:33,911 --> 00:05:37,390
you should think this and this,
which really, as you guys know,

101
00:05:37,391 --> 00:05:39,670
this is what intersectionality
is all about.

102
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:43,600
The idea behind intersectionality being
that if you take all of these groups,

103
00:05:43,780 --> 00:05:47,550
you can kind of put them together like a
transformer or something and that there

104
00:05:47,551 --> 00:05:49,120
will become something stronger.

105
00:05:49,420 --> 00:05:52,750
But actually what's been
proven and everything that's
happening in society right

106
00:05:52,751 --> 00:05:54,670
now is that they're becoming weaker.

107
00:05:54,671 --> 00:05:58,490
They're actually in a sort of oppression
Olympics where they're competing

108
00:05:58,490 --> 00:06:02,120
with each other for victimhood and,

109
00:06:02,121 --> 00:06:05,120
and victim hood is not virtue. And
that's really important. You know,

110
00:06:05,121 --> 00:06:08,210
what's virtue guys?
It's what the motto of this state is.

111
00:06:08,211 --> 00:06:11,090
Live free or die down,
whatever.

112
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:14,500
[inaudible]

113
00:06:14,650 --> 00:06:15,340
yeah,

114
00:06:15,340 --> 00:06:18,910
I mean that's kind of depressing about
the fact that we had to switch your menus

115
00:06:18,911 --> 00:06:22,750
here. I mean the state motto is live free
or die or he goes live free or go to a

116
00:06:22,751 --> 00:06:27,480
hockey rink. Um, but that's
what virtue is. Living for dye.

117
00:06:27,550 --> 00:06:29,380
Figure out what you believe.

118
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:33,400
What do you believe and fight for
that relentlessly fight for that.

119
00:06:33,580 --> 00:06:34,600
Even by the end of this thing.

120
00:06:34,601 --> 00:06:37,450
And we'll do a robust Q and a and I'm
happy to hear from any of you guys that

121
00:06:37,451 --> 00:06:40,330
disagree with me on all this stuff.
Whatever you believe,

122
00:06:40,331 --> 00:06:42,570
if you fight for it honestly and,

123
00:06:42,571 --> 00:06:46,990
and using your mind and your faculties
and not because you silence people are

124
00:06:46,991 --> 00:06:51,991
because you pulled fire alarms are called
in bomb threat if you fight for that.

125
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:57,700
I agree. Black lives do
matter. Tate, I'm with Ya.

126
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:02,530
Good. Gotcha. Okay.

127
00:07:02,531 --> 00:07:04,900
Can someone shut off the robot?
I don't know how we're going to do this,

128
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:09,880
right guys. I got you. We're glad to it.
Do you think anyone's here for you guys?

129
00:07:10,150 --> 00:07:13,200
Is that what you think?
What's going on here guys?

130
00:07:19,570 --> 00:07:23,890
I like this guy more. Listen
guys guys, guys, guys,

131
00:07:23,891 --> 00:07:25,090
do you think anyone's here for you?

132
00:07:25,091 --> 00:07:28,660
Do you understand what you're doing right
now? Hey listen, listen, listen guys,

133
00:07:28,661 --> 00:07:33,370
guys, guys, look at me. Look at me. I mean
you can at least look at me. There you go.

134
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:38,080
All right, look, look, look, look.
Do you think anyone's here for you?

135
00:07:38,350 --> 00:07:42,160
Do you think anyone's here for you?
I agree. Black lives matter. I agree.

136
00:07:42,161 --> 00:07:43,120
Black lives matter.

137
00:07:43,450 --> 00:07:48,300
Do you know how to play the quiet game
or we'll try it that way guys. Guys,

138
00:07:49,310 --> 00:07:51,400
you listen,
you got the script down.

139
00:07:51,401 --> 00:07:55,520
I'm an impress too with the repetition
and today I'm coming. You know

140
00:07:58,050 --> 00:07:58,883
guys?

141
00:08:00,940 --> 00:08:03,850
Yeah, let's try this. I see some
black people in the audience could,

142
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:05,440
could someone ask them to be quiet?

143
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:09,760
Would that maybe work guys guys,
come on.

144
00:08:13,330 --> 00:08:17,200
Thank you sister guys.
Guys. Guys, you are.

145
00:08:17,201 --> 00:08:21,610
What is wrong with this right now?
You, you are proving it right now.

146
00:08:21,860 --> 00:08:23,440
You are proving it right now.

147
00:08:23,860 --> 00:08:27,940
This nonsensical guys,
this epic,

148
00:08:27,941 --> 00:08:31,510
nonsensical self. Righteous
Bullshit. Sit down.

149
00:08:31,780 --> 00:08:36,070
Sit down. Yeah, I know.
Yell Louder. Oh God.

150
00:08:36,730 --> 00:08:40,540
Get laid. Like go do something
with your eyes. So pathetic.

151
00:08:41,380 --> 00:08:45,840
No one's here for you.
You know what?

152
00:08:45,850 --> 00:08:48,370
I'll give you a cookie if you can
say something else. How about that?

153
00:08:48,371 --> 00:08:52,540
I got a whole tray of cookies back
there. No. Yeah. Do you think,

154
00:08:52,541 --> 00:08:55,000
I don't think black lives
matter. What? What are you going?

155
00:08:55,140 --> 00:08:58,080
She's checking her phone to make sure she
got the script right. Okay. Come on now.

156
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:03,420
Come on. You can do it. You could do
it may take a seat. Make us eat. Yeah.

157
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:09,570
Okay. Remember guys,
we're the intolerant ones.

158
00:09:09,571 --> 00:09:11,480
We are the intolerant ones,
right?

159
00:09:11,481 --> 00:09:14,100
Do you know you can see all you
guys getting real violent on them.

160
00:09:14,101 --> 00:09:16,350
You know nobody's here for them.
But guys,

161
00:09:18,030 --> 00:09:22,800
what are we gonna do about this?
Alright. Alright. Five more.

162
00:09:22,801 --> 00:09:26,310
Five more. Four, three,

163
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:30,090
two,
one.

164
00:09:31,690 --> 00:09:35,970
But I really thought you were with me
on that. Um, okay. All right, hold on.

165
00:09:35,971 --> 00:09:40,110
I can do this. I can do
this. Um, guy, seriously.

166
00:09:40,111 --> 00:09:44,490
Shut the fuck up. Shut the
fuck up. It's pathetic.

167
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:49,320
You're pathetic. Human beings.
Really. I'm all about open exchange.

168
00:09:49,321 --> 00:09:50,580
This is what I do for a living.

169
00:09:50,581 --> 00:09:54,150
I will gladly take all your
questions all night long.

170
00:09:54,151 --> 00:09:58,380
You are what is wrong with society?
You said right there you are.

171
00:09:58,381 --> 00:10:02,360
What's wrong with society and you ma'am,
you're what's wrong with society?

172
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:07,160
Yeah. Hey man, needs to hear.

173
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:11,410
Yeah. I don't want to kick these guys
out. I know the police are happy to kick.

174
00:10:11,430 --> 00:10:12,840
Do you guys out?
Oh Wow.

175
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:21,290
Just refresh me for a sec. What
were you saying again? Cause I,

176
00:10:22,850 --> 00:10:26,750
yeah, just relax. Relax. Okay.
I believe black lives matter.

177
00:10:26,780 --> 00:10:28,090
I believe every life matters.

178
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:31,460
I believe that we should not be
prejudice towards everyone. Anyone.

179
00:10:31,461 --> 00:10:35,180
And we should not have laws that are
dictated that are different for anyone.

180
00:10:35,181 --> 00:10:39,380
That we should be treating everyone equal.
That is the beauty of America.

181
00:10:39,381 --> 00:10:40,730
I'm going to talk to
my friends right here.

182
00:10:40,731 --> 00:10:45,650
The beauty of this country is that people
from every walk of life have come here

183
00:10:45,890 --> 00:10:49,910
no matter the color of their skin or
their religion or whatever they came with.

184
00:10:49,911 --> 00:10:53,960
Look what it says on the, on the Statue
of Liberty. You know what I mean?

185
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:56,510
She didn't say bring us your best.
She said, bring us your poor,

186
00:10:56,511 --> 00:10:57,470
your huddled masses,

187
00:10:57,471 --> 00:11:00,500
and you know what's happened because
of the incredible freedoms that we have

188
00:11:00,501 --> 00:11:05,360
given people in this country. Everyone
look around this room. This is diversity,

189
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:08,420
but it's, as I said earlier,
it's not just diversity of color,

190
00:11:08,660 --> 00:11:11,060
it's diversity of thought.
And I'm going to come up here,

191
00:11:11,061 --> 00:11:13,310
I'm going to talk about a lot of things
that the conservatives aren't happy

192
00:11:13,311 --> 00:11:16,010
about and conservative
groups invite me to do that.

193
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:20,600
So I appreciate that you've quieted down
and if you grant me the same respect

194
00:11:20,601 --> 00:11:23,060
that I'll grant you. That's how
you change things. But that,

195
00:11:23,061 --> 00:11:24,320
that what you just did there right there,

196
00:11:24,321 --> 00:11:26,300
that's not how you change
things is how you change things.

197
00:11:26,301 --> 00:11:29,930
Just not change things for the better
anyway. How's it going on this ad guys?

198
00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:32,180
Anyone want to get
anything off their chest.

199
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:38,240
So this scourge of identity politics,
it truly,

200
00:11:38,241 --> 00:11:42,640
it truly is rotting away
at everything that's right.

201
00:11:42,641 --> 00:11:46,750
With this country. The country was founded
on the idea of the melting pot, right?

202
00:11:46,751 --> 00:11:50,740
That you come here from wherever you came,
wherever you came,

203
00:11:50,741 --> 00:11:53,170
more people have come to America,

204
00:11:53,290 --> 00:11:58,060
make a better life for themselves and
any place in the history of the world.

205
00:11:58,120 --> 00:12:02,290
That is absolutely true. Does that mean
it's perfect? No. Does that mean we don't,

206
00:12:02,291 --> 00:12:05,980
we've made mistakes. Absolutely. Does
that mean that there are injustices now?

207
00:12:05,981 --> 00:12:10,590
Of course, but there is no place which
is why no one ever leaves. All right.

208
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:14,920
Are any of you guys planning on
leaving America? Yeah. Nobody goes.

209
00:12:15,130 --> 00:12:18,700
Even Lena Dunham, she's still
here. It would be nice if she left,

210
00:12:18,701 --> 00:12:22,780
but she's still here. Okay. Nobody
leaves and this is the irony.

211
00:12:22,781 --> 00:12:27,670
So you have this set of people now who
go on and on about identity politics and

212
00:12:27,671 --> 00:12:30,850
everything that's wrong with America
and where this evil Patriarchy and where

213
00:12:30,851 --> 00:12:35,080
this evil, racist society and they
demand at the same time. I love this one.

214
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:39,880
They demand at the same time that we
should have open borders so that I guess

215
00:12:39,881 --> 00:12:44,830
the other people can share in the horrors
that are America. That is not sensible.

216
00:12:44,831 --> 00:12:46,900
You see what I'm saying?
It's not sensible people.

217
00:12:47,170 --> 00:12:51,130
What is sensible is coming
together regardless of what
your differences are and

218
00:12:51,131 --> 00:12:56,050
the only way you do that is if you view
people as individuals that every single

219
00:12:56,110 --> 00:12:59,290
one of you that I can look at you right
there looking at me with the glasses.

220
00:12:59,291 --> 00:13:01,990
You, we were, we were having a moment
there. You're looking away from me. Okay.

221
00:13:01,991 --> 00:13:03,610
I'll look at somebody else. How
you doing buddy? Right here.

222
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:07,450
The only way I can judge you, I know
nothing about you, nothing about you.

223
00:13:07,510 --> 00:13:08,560
I know nothing about you,

224
00:13:08,561 --> 00:13:11,320
but all I can figure out is
that if we had a conversation,

225
00:13:11,321 --> 00:13:13,840
I could figure out what you
think and why you think it.

226
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:17,200
And hopefully if you thought some
things that I thought were wrong through

227
00:13:17,201 --> 00:13:18,070
civility,

228
00:13:18,490 --> 00:13:21,250
I could get you to think differently
and perhaps you could get me to think

229
00:13:21,251 --> 00:13:23,920
differently. So let's talk about
some of our differences actually,

230
00:13:23,921 --> 00:13:27,610
because turning point invites me to
all of these things and Charlie has no

231
00:13:27,611 --> 00:13:31,030
problem being on stage with me and
we have plenty of differences. I am,

232
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:35,680
I'm for gay marriage. I even married
a dude. I mean that's a, yeah,

233
00:13:35,890 --> 00:13:37,930
I'm gay. Okay. Zippity Damn Dude.

234
00:13:38,070 --> 00:13:40,960
I thought I was going to get an applause
from my impression, but you know,

235
00:13:40,961 --> 00:13:44,110
all right. Um, yeah, it doesn't matter.

236
00:13:44,111 --> 00:13:46,660
It just doesn't matter what you
should want or equal rights.

237
00:13:46,661 --> 00:13:50,380
So any of you can marry whoever you
want to marry. You want equal rights,

238
00:13:50,381 --> 00:13:52,090
that's all you want.
You don't want extra eyes.

239
00:13:52,410 --> 00:13:54,850
The conservatives in
invite me to these places.

240
00:13:55,060 --> 00:13:58,150
I'm what I would describe
as begrudgingly pro choice.

241
00:13:58,210 --> 00:14:01,000
I think it's a horrible
decision to have to make,

242
00:14:01,001 --> 00:14:05,230
I know two women in the last year in my
life who had to have abortions or who

243
00:14:05,231 --> 00:14:08,530
chose to have abortions. I know this
is for the conservative. This is,

244
00:14:08,531 --> 00:14:11,350
this is a bridge too far.
And I've had plenty of people on my show.

245
00:14:11,351 --> 00:14:15,580
I had a debate with Ben Shapiro about
abortion and you know, I've picked a

246
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,350
20 weeks as the,

247
00:14:22,030 --> 00:14:26,490
I like where this one's going.
Oh,

248
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:28,310
is that rain? Is that we're, we're,

249
00:14:31,140 --> 00:14:34,670
I'm gonna need a little more on that one.
Yeah.

250
00:14:34,990 --> 00:14:39,940
Is this a local thing?
What's going on? Do you want,

251
00:14:39,941 --> 00:14:44,260
you want to ask me something? Yeah, you
could ask me something. See, this is the,

252
00:14:44,261 --> 00:14:47,820
this is what happens every time. Truly,
ma'am, if you want to ask me something,

253
00:14:47,830 --> 00:14:52,430
I'd love to hear a question in front
of you for no. So you don't have a did,

254
00:14:52,610 --> 00:14:55,490
is there anything I said they get
in like did you not like anything?

255
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:58,850
You don't want to comment on that either.
You see what's going on here?

256
00:14:58,940 --> 00:15:01,940
I really want you guys to understand
this because this is so consistent.

257
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:04,610
We can get some robots and
clones here, which, you know,

258
00:15:04,611 --> 00:15:08,140
repeating some stuff and
now you have a jar with a,

259
00:15:08,420 --> 00:15:10,310
whatever the hell you got in there.
And I'm,

260
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:14,030
I am seriously willing to
have a conversation with
you right now. Let's do it.

261
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:16,010
Let's do it.
But you won't question me.

262
00:15:16,011 --> 00:15:18,170
And you won't tell me you didn't
like anything. Who's winning here?

263
00:15:18,171 --> 00:15:21,050
Do you think right now who's
changing more minds? Me Or you?

264
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:28,930
Yeah, I think, I think I made my
point. All right. Yeah. No, it's here.

265
00:15:28,940 --> 00:15:32,940
He's got some move over here.
It's not true.

266
00:15:32,941 --> 00:15:34,950
What they say about white
people can't dance. I saw that.

267
00:15:34,951 --> 00:15:38,790
That was very impressive.
He had that two white guys have two moves,

268
00:15:38,791 --> 00:15:41,550
like a shoulder thing and a hip
thing. All right. All right.

269
00:15:41,551 --> 00:15:46,470
Put your little toy away. Uh, God. Yeah.
Well that's what I put this. But see,

270
00:15:46,471 --> 00:15:50,190
this is what's happened.
This is what has led us here to the irony.

271
00:15:50,370 --> 00:15:53,100
This is so ironic,
you guys don't remember this,

272
00:15:53,101 --> 00:15:57,420
but 10 years ago when you guys
were whatever you were, 10, 11,

273
00:15:57,421 --> 00:16:00,810
12 years old, the conservatives
were the intolerant side.

274
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:05,310
The conservatives were the ones that were
screaming against gay marriage and the

275
00:16:05,311 --> 00:16:09,090
conservatives who were the one talking
about all sorts of other stuff that was

276
00:16:09,091 --> 00:16:10,410
actually intolerant.

277
00:16:10,710 --> 00:16:14,380
This is intolerant now and you don't
get extra credit for your skin color.

278
00:16:14,381 --> 00:16:17,430
And I hate to tell Ya. So, I
mean, that's just how it is.

279
00:16:17,700 --> 00:16:21,600
I would love to have a conversation with
you and you want to rattle around a can.

280
00:16:21,601 --> 00:16:25,860
Okay, so that's fine. But this is what
has happened. You guys, the conservatives,

281
00:16:25,861 --> 00:16:28,330
the conservative. Well, how many of you
actually consider yourself conservative?

282
00:16:28,340 --> 00:16:32,250
It make some noise, makes her eyes. If you
consider yourself close to a park, yeah.

283
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:35,730
Good for you guys.
You're going to have jobs in the future.

284
00:16:35,770 --> 00:16:40,320
You're gonna have cars and family and
property and things, and it's pretty good.

285
00:16:40,321 --> 00:16:43,170
That's sweet. All right. How many of
you consider yourself a libertarian?

286
00:16:43,220 --> 00:16:46,410
Any Libertarians you can,
you can do make noise instead of clapping.

287
00:16:46,590 --> 00:16:49,670
You're all very respectful here.
Yeah. All right, libertarians,

288
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:52,140
you're going to smoke a lot of
pot. That's great. That's great.

289
00:16:52,141 --> 00:16:55,140
You're going to argue about whether
driver's license, it should be real.

290
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:00,810
I love Libertarians. I mean really
fundamentally, I think I'm probably,

291
00:17:00,811 --> 00:17:03,000
although we're going to talk about
classical liberalism in a second,

292
00:17:03,001 --> 00:17:04,500
I think actually more than anything,

293
00:17:04,710 --> 00:17:08,880
I'm a libertarian in that I want you
to live free and I want to live free.

294
00:17:08,881 --> 00:17:12,570
And the only exchange that we can have
there is that basically I'm going to have

295
00:17:12,571 --> 00:17:13,081
my stuff.

296
00:17:13,081 --> 00:17:15,570
You're going to have your stuff and you
can't just come onto my property and

297
00:17:15,571 --> 00:17:19,680
take my shit. As long as we'd get that
fun. That's a pretty good society.

298
00:17:19,890 --> 00:17:22,800
And that means that occasionally people
are gonna say things that upset you.

299
00:17:22,801 --> 00:17:25,380
That means that people are going
to do things that upset you.

300
00:17:25,381 --> 00:17:27,720
But that's the beauty of this thing.
You know,

301
00:17:27,721 --> 00:17:31,200
there are some societies where nobody's
gonna say anything that upsets you.

302
00:17:31,201 --> 00:17:34,860
You know where that is. That's North
Korea. You don't want to be there.

303
00:17:34,890 --> 00:17:38,070
You don't want to be there. You are
going to be upset every now and again,

304
00:17:38,071 --> 00:17:40,890
but you know what?
Words are not violence.

305
00:17:40,891 --> 00:17:44,640
I know that the left has tried to trick
you into thinking that because somebody

306
00:17:44,641 --> 00:17:46,290
says something that upsets you,

307
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:51,560
that you're either allowed to punch them
or silence or call in a bomb threat or

308
00:17:51,841 --> 00:17:55,050
force a venue to have to move,
but that is not. You are right.

309
00:17:55,051 --> 00:17:58,140
You have the right to free speech
and you are right to free speech.

310
00:17:58,290 --> 00:18:01,680
The whole purpose of your rights to
free speech is that you have to respect

311
00:18:01,681 --> 00:18:06,060
someone else's right to free speech. Now
what you can do by the way, is protest.

312
00:18:06,061 --> 00:18:10,160
I hope that there, thank you. I hope
that there are protesters are, are,

313
00:18:10,180 --> 00:18:13,980
are war protesters out there with as many
signs as they want to have doing their

314
00:18:13,981 --> 00:18:14,250
thing.

315
00:18:14,250 --> 00:18:17,490
And as long as you do it peacefully
and you don't encroach on anyone else's

316
00:18:17,491 --> 00:18:20,760
rights, that's, you're supposed to do
that in a free society. It's beautiful.

317
00:18:20,970 --> 00:18:23,970
But if you use your free speech
to infringe on somebody else's,

318
00:18:24,210 --> 00:18:27,570
you're actually not part
of civil society at all.

319
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:31,860
So all right, back to the libertarian.
So I liked the libertarians.

320
00:18:31,861 --> 00:18:35,430
I voted for Gary Johnson.
I had Gary Johnson on my show.

321
00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:39,840
He didn't know his name. He wasn't
the best candidate ever. Um,

322
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:44,520
Aleppo, he just, yeah, not
a, not a great candidate.

323
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:47,430
He was the first guy that ever turned me
against weed cause he couldn't remember

324
00:18:47,431 --> 00:18:52,320
if I can thing. I mean he really was
just a terrible, terrible candidate.

325
00:18:52,321 --> 00:18:53,131
This would've been the year.

326
00:18:53,131 --> 00:18:55,980
Right now it's 2016 would have been
the year for a libertarian candidate.

327
00:18:55,981 --> 00:19:00,120
I mean we had to have what I would
say are the worst candidates in,

328
00:19:00,130 --> 00:19:02,910
in at least as candidates.
We can talk about Trump in a second,

329
00:19:03,060 --> 00:19:05,010
but at least it's candidates.
We had two of the worst,

330
00:19:05,011 --> 00:19:09,780
most polarizing candidates ever and all
the libertarian had to do was come in

331
00:19:09,781 --> 00:19:14,490
and understand some basic shit
and Gary just dropped the ball.

332
00:19:14,491 --> 00:19:15,540
He just,

333
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:20,610
every interview it was like watching
a muppet right out of put it in.

334
00:19:20,611 --> 00:19:22,920
It's too easy to beat up on him,
so forget Gary dies. All right.

335
00:19:22,921 --> 00:19:26,280
How many of you guys consider yourselves
classical liberals? Classical liberals.

336
00:19:27,050 --> 00:19:29,910
All right. A couple of classical
liberals, they're very respectful.

337
00:19:29,911 --> 00:19:32,460
That's what I like. Um,
so classical liberalism,

338
00:19:32,461 --> 00:19:34,660
this is interesting because people say
to me, well, what's the difference, Dave?

339
00:19:34,661 --> 00:19:39,570
You say you're a classical liberal and
how is that different than being on the

340
00:19:39,571 --> 00:19:44,310
left? How is that different than being
a progressive and a classical liberal?

341
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:47,160
Basically?
It's really simple.

342
00:19:47,460 --> 00:19:50,040
If you believe in the individual
that I was talking about before.

343
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:53,910
If you believe that the
government has some role to exist,

344
00:19:53,911 --> 00:19:57,840
that the government has to do something,
but not everything.

345
00:19:57,990 --> 00:20:01,620
So our founders actually, mostly,
I think we're classical liberals,

346
00:20:01,621 --> 00:20:06,621
are founders basically
create an incredible system
where we have 50 states now

347
00:20:08,130 --> 00:20:10,920
and we have a federal government
that should do very little.

348
00:20:10,921 --> 00:20:12,600
The federal government should
make sure that, you know,

349
00:20:12,660 --> 00:20:14,100
they're taking care of our borders.

350
00:20:14,250 --> 00:20:17,160
They should make sure that our states
aren't warring with each other.

351
00:20:17,370 --> 00:20:20,490
But beyond that, the federal government
actually shouldn't do that much.

352
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:25,590
That if you believe in that, if you
believe there's some role for government,

353
00:20:25,591 --> 00:20:28,260
but not some massive
government that we have,

354
00:20:28,261 --> 00:20:30,270
then I think you're basically
a classical liberal.

355
00:20:30,271 --> 00:20:33,480
So the classical liberals
in the libertarians are
pretty much in the same spot.

356
00:20:33,481 --> 00:20:38,250
And ironically now the conservatives have
sorta come in and fit into that thing

357
00:20:38,251 --> 00:20:41,250
as well. So there's a pretty big
tent developing on the right.

358
00:20:41,251 --> 00:20:44,790
While the left is just purging
every one of their free thinkers.

359
00:20:44,791 --> 00:20:47,380
I mean every one of them.
Look what happened to Kanye this week.

360
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:50,800
Forget what you think about Kanye.
Forget what you think. His politics are.

361
00:20:50,860 --> 00:20:54,700
Any of you like his music or not? It's
completely irrelevant. Look what happened.

362
00:20:54,701 --> 00:20:59,070
He tweets seven words about a relative,
a girl that I know and like a lot but it,

363
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:02,980
but a relatively unknown person in
Candice Owens and suddenly everybody,

364
00:21:02,981 --> 00:21:07,270
the lead story on Twitter
moments was Kanye West.

365
00:21:07,271 --> 00:21:12,210
Tweets support for far right
Candace Owens far right candidates.

366
00:21:12,211 --> 00:21:15,940
Owens a a black girl who happens to
be a conservative. It's now far right?

367
00:21:20,170 --> 00:21:22,030
All right.

368
00:21:22,410 --> 00:21:26,040
Yeah, I'm with you. Solidarity
against hate. I am with Ya.

369
00:21:26,430 --> 00:21:30,480
I'm with you guys. Yeah, you
guys working with these two?

370
00:21:30,481 --> 00:21:35,130
You guys are definitely hang out with
them because I think it would be fun.

371
00:21:35,310 --> 00:21:39,330
Um, I'm doing, I'm with
Ya. I'm with you guys.

372
00:21:39,331 --> 00:21:40,860
Solidarity against hate.

373
00:21:40,861 --> 00:21:45,750
I don't think you should hate anyone based
on their sexuality or their eye. Lord.

374
00:21:46,550 --> 00:21:49,590
Alright. Yeah. Alright,
here we go. Here we go.

375
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:58,280
Yeah, they, they messed up the rhythm on
that one. I caught that. All right. Yeah,

376
00:21:58,281 --> 00:22:01,550
I got you guys. Yeah.
Let me, let's try this.

377
00:22:01,551 --> 00:22:03,290
How many of you here are for hate?

378
00:22:03,650 --> 00:22:06,530
How many of you are for
hate is anyone for hate?

379
00:22:06,531 --> 00:22:10,370
If we're at a hate rally here as they
would have us believe anyone for hate.

380
00:22:11,030 --> 00:22:13,790
Nobody for it. Guys, do you
think you're helping your, cause

381
00:22:13,830 --> 00:22:18,240
this is what I'm trying to tell you. Do
you think you're helping your cause here?

382
00:22:18,300 --> 00:22:21,750
Do you have any questions for
me? I'll gladly, no, no question.

383
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:26,310
You just made a point. We're going to let
it be all right. There you go. Pay Off.

384
00:22:26,311 --> 00:22:30,840
We do the mic. So we were going to
offer the mic for this nonsense. Um,

385
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:33,750
this, this is what the
problem is. You guys see this.

386
00:22:33,751 --> 00:22:36,200
I mean you really need to grasp
yourselves around this and,

387
00:22:36,220 --> 00:22:37,500
and why does this keep happening?

388
00:22:37,501 --> 00:22:41,310
Why does this sort of endless droning
and repetitive sort of pointless

389
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:45,330
statements. Everyone's against hate.
Everyone that's sensible is against hate.

390
00:22:45,331 --> 00:22:46,620
But why does this keep happening?

391
00:22:46,621 --> 00:22:50,340
And there's a reason it keeps happening
because leftism and progressivism and

392
00:22:50,341 --> 00:22:53,820
collectivism grouping people by
those immutable characteristics,

393
00:22:53,821 --> 00:22:58,230
it has been so ingrained and taught to
you guys at colleges and it has been so

394
00:22:58,231 --> 00:23:03,030
rewarded by the mainstream media
and it has been coddled. You've, oh,

395
00:23:03,090 --> 00:23:07,680
you guys have been coddled to think that
what you think automatically has to be

396
00:23:07,681 --> 00:23:10,890
right in that all the people that came
before you had no fucking clue as to what

397
00:23:10,891 --> 00:23:13,530
they were doing. But some of
them did. Some of them did.

398
00:23:13,531 --> 00:23:15,780
Some of them had bad ideas and
some of them had good ideas.

399
00:23:15,930 --> 00:23:18,600
And some people in this room have
bad ideas and some have good ideas,

400
00:23:18,990 --> 00:23:23,010
but just chanting things because
you're upset actually has no meaning.

401
00:23:23,250 --> 00:23:25,650
And that's why I still,
when we do the Q and a at the end,

402
00:23:25,651 --> 00:23:29,730
I will gladly go to you guys first if
you can come up with an original thought

403
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:33,480
and, and tell me what you think of
something. But that, but that's the truth.

404
00:23:33,510 --> 00:23:36,690
That's that sadly is the truth.
And that's why oddly,

405
00:23:36,810 --> 00:23:40,790
the right now is the home for
free thinking. I'm shocked.

406
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:43,770
This was completely not what
I ever thought would happen,

407
00:23:43,771 --> 00:23:46,700
but yet that is where we are right now.
What's that? What do you got for me?

408
00:23:47,090 --> 00:23:50,900
She's Mauldin something at me. What do
you got? What do you got? Oh No. Yeah,

409
00:23:50,990 --> 00:23:55,940
not bad, you know, turn it,
combat jet.com. Okay. Um,

410
00:23:58,040 --> 00:24:01,350
I don't even, I don't get like a referral
fee on that or anything. That's uh,

411
00:24:02,090 --> 00:24:03,830
that's just the truth,
but okay.

412
00:24:03,831 --> 00:24:06,590
So this idea of identity
politics has wreck things.

413
00:24:06,591 --> 00:24:09,590
I want to give you a couple of examples
of how it has done this. So, uh,

414
00:24:09,620 --> 00:24:11,480
I assume most of you have
seen some of my shows,

415
00:24:11,481 --> 00:24:14,720
at least I want to mention a couple
of my guests. So Jordan Peterson,

416
00:24:14,721 --> 00:24:16,070
how many of you guys know Jordan Peterson?

417
00:24:19,580 --> 00:24:20,310
Okay.

418
00:24:20,310 --> 00:24:22,170
Jordan Peterson,
for those of you that don't know him,

419
00:24:22,171 --> 00:24:26,280
he was a psychology professor
at the University of Toronto
for the past 30 years

420
00:24:26,281 --> 00:24:29,130
or so. He's done tremendous
academic work for many years.

421
00:24:29,470 --> 00:24:30,900
Really wasn't a public person.

422
00:24:30,901 --> 00:24:34,500
He had written one book a couple of
years back and about two years ago,

423
00:24:34,501 --> 00:24:37,830
Canada was going to pass.
It wasn't quite going to be a law,

424
00:24:37,831 --> 00:24:39,240
it was going to sort of be a directive.

425
00:24:39,241 --> 00:24:42,360
But we know how these things sort of
operate. It starts with, you know,

426
00:24:42,361 --> 00:24:46,470
some subtle thing and then eventually
becomes a law that if you miss gendered,

427
00:24:46,650 --> 00:24:48,420
somebody you could be fined.

428
00:24:48,690 --> 00:24:51,480
And then potentially this would
lead to imprison minutes on point.

429
00:24:51,481 --> 00:24:52,770
Now let's be very clear.

430
00:24:52,771 --> 00:24:57,000
Here I am 100% for
equality for trans people.

431
00:24:57,150 --> 00:25:02,120
Jordan, who I know extremely well. We're
going on tour together. I'm not what,

432
00:25:08,380 --> 00:25:09,213
okay,

433
00:25:09,350 --> 00:25:12,420
I got no, I got no problem with you. I
don't know what you're talking about.

434
00:25:12,421 --> 00:25:16,590
I have trans friends. Uh, I dunno what,
what do you mean? I, I think you should

435
00:25:23,650 --> 00:25:24,483
there.

436
00:25:25,290 --> 00:25:29,280
Yeah. Well it's all right. I'm
only gay after 10 is that right?

437
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:33,510
Whoa. Whoa. So, all right.
All right, let's do it.

438
00:25:33,511 --> 00:25:36,630
You seem to have thought so that's
pretty good. So what have I said that is,

439
00:25:36,660 --> 00:25:37,650
that is so offensive to you.

440
00:25:37,651 --> 00:25:42,390
I am 100% for you to have the same
exact dignity that everyone else in this

441
00:25:42,391 --> 00:25:45,540
country as I am 100%
for you to have every,

442
00:25:45,541 --> 00:25:49,200
every law and legal protection that
anyone else in this country has.

443
00:25:49,201 --> 00:25:53,880
So what is it that you don't, uh,
want me to say that I have said here?

444
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:55,833
Wow.

445
00:25:59,820 --> 00:26:03,720
Well, I was about to get to that until you
started screaming. Yeah. All right, well,

446
00:26:05,610 --> 00:26:08,980
you know what? Here's the thing. We have
a right to free speech. You don't have it.

447
00:26:09,060 --> 00:26:13,560
Hang on. Hang on. Listen. Okay, I got Ya.
I got Ya. Okay, so real. You know what?

448
00:26:13,950 --> 00:26:18,270
Here's the deal in, in free
western societies, you have
the right to free speech.

449
00:26:18,271 --> 00:26:21,000
You don't, you don't have the
right to not be offended. Now,

450
00:26:21,001 --> 00:26:25,560
I am not for people running down the
street and and saying anything hateful to

451
00:26:25,561 --> 00:26:28,260
you, but really think about
what you're calling for here.

452
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:29,790
Think about what you're calling for here.

453
00:26:29,791 --> 00:26:33,600
What you're saying is that if
someone walking down the street says,

454
00:26:34,150 --> 00:26:35,280
Miss Miss Genders,

455
00:26:35,281 --> 00:26:39,450
you right that you want this
person to be fined or put in jail,

456
00:26:39,620 --> 00:26:42,740
that's what you think is right.
Is that, is that correctly?

457
00:26:42,741 --> 00:26:43,850
I don't want put words in your mouth.

458
00:26:48,730 --> 00:26:51,670
You're right. And you know how people
should be held accountable by themselves,

459
00:26:51,671 --> 00:26:55,780
by their family, by their friends, by
their community, not the government.

460
00:26:55,781 --> 00:26:57,160
And this was again was the government.

461
00:26:57,161 --> 00:26:59,410
But see how I already got you
to move on your position there.

462
00:27:00,190 --> 00:27:03,520
I think anyone can understand that you
wouldn't want the government coming in

463
00:27:03,521 --> 00:27:07,600
and telling people what you can
and cannot say. So Jordan said,

464
00:27:07,601 --> 00:27:11,080
I am not against Trans people and
it's very clear to me that he's not

465
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:15,760
there at this flat. Finally,
someone making some sense out there.

466
00:27:18,580 --> 00:27:20,710
So you really need to understand this.
You don't,

467
00:27:20,711 --> 00:27:22,390
you don't have a right to be not offended.

468
00:27:22,420 --> 00:27:27,070
I wish we all wish that we lived in a
better place where magically everybody was

469
00:27:27,071 --> 00:27:30,670
wonderful, where magically
everyone was sweet and decent.

470
00:27:30,820 --> 00:27:32,050
We don't live in that world.

471
00:27:32,051 --> 00:27:37,051
But if you think that the government
forcing people to do to act as you wish

472
00:27:37,061 --> 00:27:40,360
they would act is going to bring
peace and love and harmony,

473
00:27:40,540 --> 00:27:44,830
it actually will only bring the complete
reverse every time in the history of

474
00:27:44,831 --> 00:27:47,500
the world that the
government promised utopia,

475
00:27:47,501 --> 00:27:51,730
it brought dystopia every time that
the government expanded to create some

476
00:27:51,731 --> 00:27:55,810
magical society, it brings societies
that kill millions of people.

477
00:27:55,990 --> 00:27:59,440
So what you should want is exactly
what you have in America right now,

478
00:27:59,620 --> 00:28:03,850
which is that you have equality. You,
you can have a job, you can live free.

479
00:28:03,851 --> 00:28:05,770
I hope you have someone in
your life that you love.

480
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:07,690
You can have all of those things.

481
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:12,070
And if the government started cracking
down on you because you happen to be

482
00:28:12,071 --> 00:28:16,150
trans, I will be your biggest ally. I
will be out there with you every day.

483
00:28:16,390 --> 00:28:19,660
So you really need to be careful
what you ask for. I get it.

484
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:22,240
You're coming from a place
where you don't want to be hurt.

485
00:28:22,270 --> 00:28:26,230
Nobody wants to be hurt, right? Everybody
has had bad shits said about them.

486
00:28:26,231 --> 00:28:29,410
Everyone's got something they're
insecure about. Everyone's got it.

487
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:34,000
But believe me, the idea that the
government is going to solve that problem,

488
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:37,840
it is not the way to go.
Did we get anywhere there?

489
00:28:37,900 --> 00:28:41,570
I kind of felt good about that.
No, we didn't get anywhere. Okay.

490
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:45,750
We didn't get anywhere. I think maybe
I got somewhere with a couple of ideas.

491
00:28:45,940 --> 00:28:50,620
That's all right. Um, this is why
conversation is so important guys. Right?

492
00:28:50,621 --> 00:28:53,650
Like we can just kind of yell at each
other and this is what's happening and

493
00:28:53,651 --> 00:28:55,680
this is what the media wants us to do.
You know,

494
00:28:55,700 --> 00:29:00,250
you can turn on CNN and no one in their
right mind is learning anything from

495
00:29:00,251 --> 00:29:04,510
CNN. You turn on CNN and you
get eight screens of yelling.

496
00:29:04,511 --> 00:29:06,430
People who don't even know
how to tie their shoes,

497
00:29:06,431 --> 00:29:09,670
telling you that they know how to run
the world. It's all nonsense. Actually.

498
00:29:09,671 --> 00:29:13,450
The best way to watch CNN, put it on mute
and put the looney tunes theme song on,

499
00:29:13,750 --> 00:29:18,210
um, is far, far better than what
CNN is showing you. But all of,

500
00:29:18,280 --> 00:29:22,930
but this is what, this is why you
guys have turned onto the online news.

501
00:29:22,930 --> 00:29:24,040
However you get your news,

502
00:29:24,041 --> 00:29:27,100
whether you're on the left and you may
be watched TYT or you're on the right and

503
00:29:27,101 --> 00:29:29,980
you'll listen to Ben Shapiro
or whatever else it is,

504
00:29:30,250 --> 00:29:31,630
that there is a beautiful thing there.

505
00:29:31,631 --> 00:29:34,450
It is now on you guys to
figure out what you believe,

506
00:29:34,451 --> 00:29:39,340
find sources that you care about.
If you think that Dave Rubin is a bigoted,

507
00:29:39,341 --> 00:29:43,930
hateful, whatever, don't watch.
I mean that's the beauty.
You don't have to show up.

508
00:29:43,931 --> 00:29:46,780
You don't have to support. I mean
it's a, it's a beautiful thing.

509
00:29:46,781 --> 00:29:51,180
I mean this is what the exchange of
freedom is all about. Um, I feel I could,

510
00:29:51,250 --> 00:29:52,420
I could keep going here,

511
00:29:52,421 --> 00:29:55,990
but I'm kind of tempted to just jump
right into the questions because it seems

512
00:29:55,991 --> 00:29:59,020
like some of you guys have some
questions and I truly happy to.

513
00:29:59,350 --> 00:30:01,870
We could start with all people that
disagree with everything I said here.

514
00:30:01,871 --> 00:30:03,100
So how are we doing the questions?

515
00:30:03,101 --> 00:30:05,050
I think there's a couple
of microphones around here,

516
00:30:05,051 --> 00:30:06,100
so we've got some mics up there.

517
00:30:06,101 --> 00:30:09,730
So if you've got a question and we've
got one down here, please come on down.

518
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,610
We can start with you right there.
I feel like you've got something for me.

519
00:30:14,030 --> 00:30:16,060
Yeah. Yeah. Let's roll.

520
00:30:19,900 --> 00:30:24,110
I'll just stand here.
Hold it free speech,

521
00:30:24,111 --> 00:30:26,210
but he's going to hold the
mic for me. Okay. All right.

522
00:30:26,270 --> 00:30:28,200
You can get unless you
want to. I mean, see,

523
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:32,360
so you see how silly you're coming in.
You're coming in. Ready, ready to fight.

524
00:30:33,950 --> 00:30:36,680
Interesting that he's holding the mic.
All right. Why don't you give her the mic?

525
00:30:36,681 --> 00:30:38,130
Let's, let's, why don't you pass me?

526
00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:43,530
[inaudible]

527
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:47,390
big wind. Big Wind. Okay. I was
serious about the suit by the way.

528
00:30:49,700 --> 00:30:54,010
So you don't believe hate
speech exists? No. And you,

529
00:30:54,030 --> 00:30:56,210
the Supreme Court agrees
with me by the way. Great.

530
00:30:56,660 --> 00:30:59,510
You and the rest of the people who are
here with you or who are supposed to be

531
00:30:59,511 --> 00:31:04,511
here with you claim that people have
a victimhood complex and that anything

532
00:31:06,230 --> 00:31:11,230
regarding racism or sexism or whatever
it is that we're talking about is fake

533
00:31:11,901 --> 00:31:15,440
news and everybody is just out
here wanting to be a victim,

534
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:17,900
as if that's something you know
that people are spending spinal.

535
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:19,550
I wake up every morning and I say,
wow,

536
00:31:19,730 --> 00:31:23,510
how can I be a be a victim despite
Dave Rubin or Charlie Kirk?

537
00:31:24,030 --> 00:31:26,630
I just want to understand,
I just want to understand

538
00:31:28,700 --> 00:31:32,660
like what does it take for,
for you know,

539
00:31:32,661 --> 00:31:37,661
folks on your end of the Io to understand
that people have lived experiences and

540
00:31:38,181 --> 00:31:40,730
who wake up every day,
every single day in this country,

541
00:31:40,910 --> 00:31:45,910
whether you think the victim had complex
is real or not and they don't feel like

542
00:31:46,101 --> 00:31:49,460
a part of this country.
And you can sit and blame all you want.

543
00:31:49,940 --> 00:31:52,670
But this campus is a
great example right here.

544
00:31:52,910 --> 00:31:56,420
When we have people on this campus who
are claiming that it is all sunshine and

545
00:31:56,421 --> 00:31:59,090
rainbows and they have the
administration on their side.

546
00:31:59,300 --> 00:32:01,490
And then the reality is
that biased incidents,

547
00:32:01,491 --> 00:32:04,170
reports and hate crimes have gone up.
Yes.

548
00:32:04,550 --> 00:32:07,910
And people have been spit on and people
have been threatened and people have

549
00:32:07,911 --> 00:32:11,180
been told to go home to their country
even though they were born in fucking New

550
00:32:11,180 --> 00:32:11,440
Jersey.
Yeah.

551
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:15,090
So I just want to understand where's
the like do like do I have to get lunch?

552
00:32:15,110 --> 00:32:18,980
Like does somebody have to like murder me?
Like does somebody have to like,

553
00:32:19,070 --> 00:32:21,860
so there's Tony basically harass me.

554
00:32:22,070 --> 00:32:27,070
What would it take for it to be hate
speech and when do I actually become a

555
00:32:27,741 --> 00:32:32,060
victim when I'm dead? Okay.
All right. Great question.
Great question. That's great.

556
00:32:32,140 --> 00:32:36,620
[inaudible]

557
00:32:36,930 --> 00:32:39,140
all right. It's a great
question. So first off,

558
00:32:39,141 --> 00:32:42,590
the supreme court has ruled that hates
beached as an exist in that you can do

559
00:32:42,591 --> 00:32:47,510
basically you can say whatever you
want short of yelling fire in a crowded

560
00:32:47,511 --> 00:32:50,330
theater or calling for
direct violence to someone.

561
00:32:50,510 --> 00:32:54,530
So right now you can say anything to me.
You can literally say anything to me.

562
00:32:54,531 --> 00:32:57,530
I'm sure you're thinking of
a couple things and you can
say whatever you want to

563
00:32:57,531 --> 00:32:59,180
be in, guess what? I'll, I'll survive.

564
00:32:59,420 --> 00:33:02,960
And that's the price that you have
to pay to live in a free society.

565
00:33:02,961 --> 00:33:05,460
So let me kick it back to you
for a second. So first off you,

566
00:33:05,510 --> 00:33:08,600
there was a little miscommunication
in the way you presented that,

567
00:33:08,601 --> 00:33:12,320
which is racism exists.
I don't think racism doesn't exist.

568
00:33:12,470 --> 00:33:14,240
Of course there are bigoted people,

569
00:33:14,390 --> 00:33:18,980
there are people who are buyer are
misogynists that may not like you because

570
00:33:18,981 --> 00:33:22,160
you're a woman. There are people
that are, are don't like gay people.

571
00:33:22,161 --> 00:33:22,941
So they won't like me.

572
00:33:22,941 --> 00:33:26,390
There are people that are truly prejudice
against black people in every other

573
00:33:26,391 --> 00:33:27,140
situation.

574
00:33:27,140 --> 00:33:30,920
The idea that the government can come in
and manage and fix all of those things

575
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:31,971
is crazy.

576
00:33:31,971 --> 00:33:36,971
And we live in a society that has done
more to free more people than any other

577
00:33:37,491 --> 00:33:40,280
society,
truly in the history of the world.

578
00:33:40,520 --> 00:33:43,160
But I will kick it back to you
for a second. So tell me about,

579
00:33:43,280 --> 00:33:45,350
tell me about your oppression.
I mean,

580
00:33:45,351 --> 00:33:49,190
tell me about what you are dealing
with and how the government can fix it.

581
00:33:49,310 --> 00:33:53,420
It doesn't mean that bad people don't
exist, but tell me about your oppression.

582
00:33:53,421 --> 00:33:54,860
Maybe.
Maybe we can work through something.

583
00:33:56,960 --> 00:34:00,780
That's my favorite song.
Yeah.

584
00:34:01,540 --> 00:34:05,820
Well that one was legit. It was
your mom. Nice. Alright, I have you.

585
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:06,570
Tell me about your work

586
00:34:06,570 --> 00:34:07,281
oppression.
What if all,

587
00:34:07,281 --> 00:34:11,100
I have no reason to sit and talk about
my own oppression because that's just

588
00:34:11,101 --> 00:34:15,580
like mental energy. Well, I'm
going to be paid to talk about my,

589
00:34:17,470 --> 00:34:18,910
hey ladies,

590
00:34:26,590 --> 00:34:29,320
ladies. Ladies, I'll gladly take
your question if I May. I have.

591
00:34:29,321 --> 00:34:32,230
We established that already. Okay, so,

592
00:34:32,231 --> 00:34:36,310
so far we have some repetitive droning
statements and then when I take it back

593
00:34:36,311 --> 00:34:39,550
to someone to ask about their oppression,
she wants to be paid for it.

594
00:34:39,590 --> 00:34:43,180
You know what I, let me see what I got
here. Why don't you pay pal me? Yeah.

595
00:34:43,181 --> 00:34:47,100
Well let me see what I can
do here. Venmo me, I got,

596
00:34:48,340 --> 00:34:49,180
let's see what I got here.

597
00:34:49,920 --> 00:34:52,930
Hi Violet.
Violet,

598
00:34:53,180 --> 00:34:57,500
20 bucks. I got 20 bucks. I will pay.

599
00:34:57,501 --> 00:35:02,450
You will pay you.
Okay,

600
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:05,870
so what would you prefer? What would
you prefer? That the government,

601
00:35:06,530 --> 00:35:10,580
okay guys, I get it. I don't want
people to say bad things easier.

602
00:35:14,030 --> 00:35:17,360
I wish I could get off to the sound of
my own voice. Wouldn't that be awesome?

603
00:35:17,870 --> 00:35:21,260
You seem to get off the sound of your
own voice. Spam seal. You're angry,

604
00:35:21,261 --> 00:35:23,480
you're angry, and there's no
reason to be angry. You're,

605
00:35:23,630 --> 00:35:26,510
you're standing in front of that angry.
You're standing in front of someone.

606
00:35:26,511 --> 00:35:30,800
That's truly, that comes from the
place that you are in right now.

607
00:35:30,801 --> 00:35:33,200
I was a lefty my entire life.
I get it.

608
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:36,470
I get interesting how you've put
up political label on me already.

609
00:35:38,460 --> 00:35:41,310
All right. All right, let's
go. Let's move on. We tried,

610
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:44,130
but really if you want to tell me your
impression, I'll give you 20 bucks.

611
00:35:44,170 --> 00:35:47,400
I was mainly doing this. The ball. Yeah.

612
00:35:53,160 --> 00:35:54,610
So easy with you guys.

613
00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:59,960
Don't tell you what's that.
Oh,

614
00:35:59,970 --> 00:36:02,950
she saw us in another 20 on right?
We got 40 bucks for you.

615
00:36:07,220 --> 00:36:09,880
What are you doing here? Whoa,
Whoa, whoa. Don't you have hobby?

616
00:36:09,881 --> 00:36:14,700
I have a first amendment right to
be here and actually part of the,

617
00:36:14,790 --> 00:36:15,990
part of the freedom,

618
00:36:16,170 --> 00:36:19,500
part of the freedom and the contractual
exchange we have is free people living

619
00:36:19,501 --> 00:36:23,070
in a free society is that you're not
supposed to use your free speech to drown

620
00:36:23,071 --> 00:36:27,180
out someone else's. So I'm truly asking
you, I am truly so I just want to know.

621
00:36:27,210 --> 00:36:28,050
I just,
again,

622
00:36:28,051 --> 00:36:33,051
I know this boundary where someone else's
free speech is infringing on your free

623
00:36:34,141 --> 00:36:34,800
speech.

624
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:39,800
You went you those boundaries literally
infringes on other people's existence.

625
00:36:39,841 --> 00:36:43,560
I just know it, but slam, just bouncy. See
where you end up being. So look you have,

626
00:36:43,650 --> 00:36:45,360
I told you what the boundaries are.
The boundaries are,

627
00:36:45,361 --> 00:36:48,450
you can't yell fire in a crowded
theater and you can't call directly for

628
00:36:48,451 --> 00:36:52,290
violence, but short of that you
are allowed in a free society.

629
00:36:52,370 --> 00:36:56,200
So I just have a quiet, would prefer those
people, their background. What's that?

630
00:36:56,210 --> 00:36:57,600
Who I,
what's your background?

631
00:36:58,460 --> 00:37:02,720
Some ridiculous [inaudible]
the question again.

632
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:06,600
And you are Jewish, correct? Yeah. So

633
00:37:08,980 --> 00:37:11,220
I abhor anti Semitism.

634
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:16,230
So by your own like standard logic,
people can see shit about the Jews. Yeah.

635
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:17,153
You're allowing,

636
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:21,000
you're allowing family on both sides
of my family die in the Holocaust and I

637
00:37:21,001 --> 00:37:22,080
grew up around Holocaust.

638
00:37:23,030 --> 00:37:28,030
The speech that is espoused against
Jewish people does not promote violence

639
00:37:29,100 --> 00:37:32,280
against them. You are allowed
to, in a free society,

640
00:37:32,281 --> 00:37:37,280
I would prefer that people be
nicer. Right? I look for somebody,

641
00:37:37,300 --> 00:37:41,940
a spouse, antisemitism, and that
may or may not lead to violence.

642
00:37:42,190 --> 00:37:46,530
Again, handling claw hall for violence
to people. But what you can do,

643
00:37:46,531 --> 00:37:49,120
it's the exchange of freedom.
Would you prefer,

644
00:37:49,121 --> 00:37:53,340
I think there's a correlation between
hating Jews and wanting to kill them.

645
00:37:53,370 --> 00:37:57,780
Yes or no question. You're asking
me quick. All right, let's move on.

646
00:37:57,960 --> 00:38:00,840
Yes or no, right? You're like
a hostage situation over here.

647
00:38:01,740 --> 00:38:04,370
I can't believe that's like,
I'm not.

648
00:38:07,090 --> 00:38:07,923
I would,

649
00:38:08,580 --> 00:38:13,110
I would prefer that people not say bad
shit about Jews or bad shit about Muslims

650
00:38:13,111 --> 00:38:16,980
or gay people or anyone, but
the freedom, yes or no question.

651
00:38:17,650 --> 00:38:22,320
What was the question? The question
is question and his are so tolerant.

652
00:38:22,321 --> 00:38:25,710
You guys are such good guys.
You're such good. Okay.

653
00:38:26,010 --> 00:38:29,430
It's so fascinating that you cleaned
the left has a victim complex.

654
00:38:30,090 --> 00:38:34,090
Anytime somebody yells at you,
you also put on the victim complex.

655
00:38:34,360 --> 00:38:36,670
I'm not anybody's who's victim of mine,

656
00:38:40,620 --> 00:38:44,200
who's a victim of my who's victim,
and I don't want anything from you.

657
00:38:44,201 --> 00:38:47,680
I want you to live your life in
peace. Go, go live your life in peace.

658
00:38:47,681 --> 00:38:51,350
I don't want anything from you and I
don't want any bit. Yeah. All right,

659
00:38:53,500 --> 00:38:54,333
let's move on.

660
00:38:56,820 --> 00:38:59,890
Do you believe that people
who say they hate Jews?

661
00:38:59,950 --> 00:39:03,730
I believe pill not be likely
to want to attack Jews.

662
00:39:04,980 --> 00:39:07,750
Jewish man. I'm really
shocked. They might be,

663
00:39:07,751 --> 00:39:11,020
but you have the right to say
mean things in a free society.

664
00:39:11,260 --> 00:39:15,300
Do you think antisemitism is just
a man thing? Should we go like,

665
00:39:15,310 --> 00:39:18,460
can I go to hit lows grave and tell him,
you know, it was just all a mean thing.

666
00:39:18,760 --> 00:39:19,810
Can Wow.

667
00:39:19,811 --> 00:39:24,430
Can you can go to Hillary's grave
until a dead person that he was mean.

668
00:39:24,700 --> 00:39:29,110
You can. That's freedom.
I really in the grave,

669
00:39:29,140 --> 00:39:30,800
that's what I can tell you right now.
Yeah.

670
00:39:30,890 --> 00:39:34,420
My ancestors who who died in the
genocide are rolling in their graves

671
00:39:36,190 --> 00:39:41,080
to violence or listen that we've
done it called me pathetic.

672
00:39:41,870 --> 00:39:44,060
Yeah.
No.

673
00:39:45,130 --> 00:39:47,770
Oh antisemetic when I'm saying

674
00:39:49,660 --> 00:39:54,410
hate speech against Jews will lead to
violence. All right, well let's move on.

675
00:39:54,430 --> 00:39:59,250
Let's more, I'm happy to do, I literally
do this with, I just have a question like,

676
00:39:59,490 --> 00:40:02,950
like what's supposed to be having
a civil discourse? Like why,

677
00:40:02,951 --> 00:40:05,980
why do you want me to shut up?
I thought this was civil discourse.

678
00:40:05,990 --> 00:40:09,280
You know as years a couple hundred
people here that all would love to share

679
00:40:09,281 --> 00:40:11,860
their thoughts. Not a couple
of hundred. I think I get.

680
00:40:13,660 --> 00:40:15,700
How are we doing right here? Here, here.

681
00:40:15,701 --> 00:40:18,280
Why don't we give this lady the make
right here in the red right here. Let's,

682
00:40:18,281 --> 00:40:22,960
let's mix it up. All right guys.
Other people have questions.

683
00:40:22,961 --> 00:40:27,400
Let's move on. See, this is the palm. You,
you're not oppressed. You're entitled.

684
00:40:27,490 --> 00:40:28,330
I hope not.

685
00:40:28,331 --> 00:40:33,331
You know what's [inaudible] here?

686
00:40:35,650 --> 00:40:40,090
Nobody came here for
you. Sit Down Right now.

687
00:40:40,120 --> 00:40:42,880
I know what I have said. Have
I cleaned? I'm oppressed.

688
00:40:42,881 --> 00:40:46,840
So you just put those words in my mouth.
All right. Bye Bye. Okay. Okay, go ahead.

689
00:40:47,140 --> 00:40:49,090
I'm here practicing my
first amendment right.

690
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:53,880
I'm going to give the Mike out of respect
to whoever wants to shit talk to you.

691
00:40:53,890 --> 00:40:55,450
Now when I put this mic down,

692
00:40:55,630 --> 00:40:58,930
I just want you to know that your
opinion literally means bullshit to me.

693
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:02,810
And if you agree with the concept,
yeah, I have a right to say it,

694
00:41:02,811 --> 00:41:05,580
so I'm gonna say it so you have
a right to offend them out.

695
00:41:05,620 --> 00:41:07,600
Let me get this straight.
Let me get this straight

696
00:41:10,090 --> 00:41:14,840
personal vendetta against my character.
I'm not going after people. Ah,

697
00:41:14,850 --> 00:41:18,220
so you've been playing the laws of
society and telling people who they can

698
00:41:18,221 --> 00:41:21,310
offend and who they can offend and when
and when they can't even eat can offend

699
00:41:21,311 --> 00:41:24,120
anybody.
But those are huge difference between now

700
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:29,500
you're Jewish or block and
just normally being offended.

701
00:41:29,590 --> 00:41:33,710
I don't want anyone to die because they're
Jewish or not saying that you're that

702
00:41:33,740 --> 00:41:37,070
[inaudible] speech.

703
00:41:38,600 --> 00:41:41,660
You are invoicing. Yeah. I don't think
you know what to facto it means either,

704
00:41:41,661 --> 00:41:43,360
but I just read a lot.

705
00:41:43,370 --> 00:41:48,290
You know that I am a double major and
I do research actual organization.

706
00:41:48,690 --> 00:41:53,170
Great. You literally and do not know who
I am. I don't know who you are. Not Right.

707
00:41:53,190 --> 00:41:57,710
I don't either. You know what's
fascinating? Yeah. I have not gone,

708
00:41:58,350 --> 00:42:01,490
I have not said a single thing about your
personal character up until this point.

709
00:42:01,670 --> 00:42:04,940
You have belittled me. Said that I
don't understand what words mean.

710
00:42:05,130 --> 00:42:08,000
Have told me to shut up.
I've told me that I'm taking up space.

711
00:42:08,150 --> 00:42:10,950
Isn't that fascinating?
So who really is the intolerant ones?

712
00:42:11,070 --> 00:42:14,390
Cause all I've done is just talk pretty
loudly on a mic as you have a problem on

713
00:42:14,391 --> 00:42:15,980
the boom and talking
pretty loudly on a mic.

714
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:22,000
[inaudible]

715
00:42:25,360 --> 00:42:28,880
somebody else can get a Preston
because I so gracious. Need,

716
00:42:28,990 --> 00:42:33,820
we've been free speech. Yeah. Yeah. It's
all good. It's all good guys. This is,

717
00:42:33,821 --> 00:42:36,850
this is what it's all about. Really
tailor. This is what it's all about.

718
00:42:39,640 --> 00:42:44,120
It's our strawberry.
I have a plan

719
00:42:45,270 --> 00:42:48,330
notice in the free society that we
live in. No one's coming for you now.

720
00:42:48,360 --> 00:42:50,580
You can post that on Twitter.
You can do whatever you want.

721
00:42:50,581 --> 00:42:52,770
It's a beautiful thing.
It's a beautiful thing.

722
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:55,290
Yeah. Hey Dave, a big fan. Um,

723
00:42:55,760 --> 00:42:58,990
just want to say start up before
I get to the question is that, um,

724
00:42:59,080 --> 00:43:00,280
my parents came from Afghanistan.

725
00:43:00,281 --> 00:43:05,281
They escaped the day before the
Russians invaded Christmas of 1979.

726
00:43:05,770 --> 00:43:10,000
Um, so they all live in America now.
Uh, they love it. They'd never leave.

727
00:43:10,270 --> 00:43:15,220
Um, and every day growing up,
uh, you know, I not every day,

728
00:43:15,221 --> 00:43:17,800
you know, there's sometimes like
my skin's a little bit darker.

729
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:19,240
I grew up in a very white neighborhood.

730
00:43:19,420 --> 00:43:22,630
I got some offhand comments about me
being Afghany terrorist jokes, everything.

731
00:43:22,631 --> 00:43:25,240
I was like, all right, whatever. That's
how I, that's how I dealt with it. I said,

732
00:43:25,540 --> 00:43:26,170
whatever,

733
00:43:26,170 --> 00:43:29,830
I didn't internalize my oppression as
some people thought may think I did.

734
00:43:29,831 --> 00:43:32,860
I just really didn't care because
they're going to make jokes.

735
00:43:32,890 --> 00:43:35,500
They're really not going to go that far
because people are truly intolerant.

736
00:43:35,810 --> 00:43:37,510
I don't think they're gonna
really go anywhere in life.

737
00:43:37,511 --> 00:43:40,660
So that's what I'm saying about that is
if you're truly people who were in truly

738
00:43:40,661 --> 00:43:42,400
intolerant aren't really
going to get anywhere.

739
00:43:42,460 --> 00:43:45,190
And so I just don't let
that stuff bother me. Um,

740
00:43:45,710 --> 00:43:48,430
but I wanted to ask about Marcus
Meechan. Do you know him? Um,

741
00:43:48,460 --> 00:43:52,770
the account dangler the guy who, oh yeah,
yeah, yeah. I just wanted to ask like, Eh,

742
00:43:53,380 --> 00:43:57,670
how ridiculous do you think it is for
a joke about that turning a pug into a

743
00:43:57,671 --> 00:43:59,800
Nazi? However Duke is do they
get is that man was arrested.

744
00:43:59,801 --> 00:44:03,300
His life was put on hold for two
years. Like I, it was just, it's insane

745
00:44:03,300 --> 00:44:06,270
to me. Like it's completely insane. So
are you all familiar with this story?

746
00:44:06,271 --> 00:44:09,350
So this is a, an online youtube comic, uh,

747
00:44:09,420 --> 00:44:14,010
who basically he was doing a joke,
it was a joke and he had his,

748
00:44:14,011 --> 00:44:18,690
his dog do the Hitler salute. Now
again, I am not for the Hitler salute.

749
00:44:18,720 --> 00:44:20,010
I am not for Nazis.

750
00:44:20,011 --> 00:44:24,660
I am not for white supremacism or racism
of any kind or anything like that.

751
00:44:24,870 --> 00:44:28,300
But the guy made a joke and you can say
it's a shitty joke. He's a bad comic.

752
00:44:28,320 --> 00:44:31,860
It's a tasteless joke, all of those
things. But in a free society,

753
00:44:31,861 --> 00:44:36,390
you have a right to do those things.
You have a right to offend.

754
00:44:36,391 --> 00:44:41,391
It is on you as the person
on the receiving end of
that to decide whether that

755
00:44:42,001 --> 00:44:46,470
is going to ruin your day or make you
stronger in what your beliefs are or

756
00:44:46,471 --> 00:44:48,420
anything else. So it's, by the way, the,

757
00:44:48,430 --> 00:44:52,470
the real issue with this is
every one of us, every one of us,

758
00:44:52,471 --> 00:44:53,700
even if you just hate me,

759
00:44:53,910 --> 00:44:58,110
every one of us should be thanking
whatever you believe in that we are here,

760
00:44:58,140 --> 00:45:01,500
we have the protections. He would have
been able to do that in the United States.

761
00:45:01,710 --> 00:45:03,210
Now,
you may not like it again,

762
00:45:03,390 --> 00:45:07,860
but we have the protections that allow
you to live your life to the maximum

763
00:45:07,861 --> 00:45:09,150
potential in this country.

764
00:45:09,151 --> 00:45:13,570
We live in a place that a young guy
whose parents came from Afghanistan award

765
00:45:13,571 --> 00:45:17,850
and torn country can come here and not
make excuses and do everything that you

766
00:45:17,851 --> 00:45:20,310
want to do in your life and
you're going to do amazing things.

767
00:45:20,311 --> 00:45:22,950
I have no doubt about it.
That is a beautiful thing.

768
00:45:23,130 --> 00:45:25,440
You have no desire to play the victim.

769
00:45:25,530 --> 00:45:28,530
You're going to go out there
and bust your ass and yes,

770
00:45:28,680 --> 00:45:32,250
will there be someone that you might
want to work for that's going to go, wow,

771
00:45:32,251 --> 00:45:34,790
he's got brown skin and I'm a racist
and I'm not going to hire him.

772
00:45:34,791 --> 00:45:39,090
That might happen. It might, but you
know what? Someone else will find you.

773
00:45:39,091 --> 00:45:40,770
And the more that these companies,

774
00:45:40,950 --> 00:45:42,870
if there was a big company
out there that's saying,

775
00:45:42,871 --> 00:45:46,320
we're not going to hire this person or
that person based on skin color or based

776
00:45:46,321 --> 00:45:50,190
on race, they will crumble. Look what's
happening in Silicon Valley right now.

777
00:45:50,430 --> 00:45:54,360
It's actually amazing. It's amazing what's
happening in Silicon Valley right now.

778
00:45:54,600 --> 00:45:58,650
Peter Thiel is leaving Silicon
Valley because leftist, uh,

779
00:45:58,710 --> 00:46:02,280
you got to work on getting that.
Oh, she's got a backup. Um,

780
00:46:03,870 --> 00:46:08,060
it's incredible [inaudible]
leaving silicon valley
because leftism has caused a

781
00:46:08,061 --> 00:46:10,860
situation where they
cannot even think straight.

782
00:46:11,160 --> 00:46:14,100
They cannot come up with new ideas.
That's why there were no new apps.

783
00:46:14,310 --> 00:46:17,070
Where's the new Twitter? Where's the
new snapchat? Where's the new Facebook?

784
00:46:17,280 --> 00:46:20,040
We can't come out of the group thing.
So whatever you want to do in your life,

785
00:46:20,041 --> 00:46:22,170
you're going to do great
things. I have no doubt. Yeah.

786
00:46:26,040 --> 00:46:29,580
Why don't we go right here.
Red Jacket right here.

787
00:46:31,680 --> 00:46:32,513
Yup.

788
00:46:34,780 --> 00:46:36,930
Mike,
my question is,

789
00:46:36,931 --> 00:46:41,931
you're trying to lead a civil discourse
day of it and why is it that some people

790
00:46:42,090 --> 00:46:47,090
believe that it's okay to be disrespectful
in interrupt so that some of us can't

791
00:46:47,431 --> 00:46:51,840
hear the presentation and hear other
questions and hear your views on things?

792
00:46:52,990 --> 00:46:56,860
Yeah, I mean, I don't know
that I'm the right guy to be
asking that. I will gladly,

793
00:46:56,920 --> 00:46:59,820
I will gladly talk to all of these
people. I mean, really that's how you,

794
00:46:59,860 --> 00:47:02,890
the way you change your mind,
the way you change minds guys,

795
00:47:02,891 --> 00:47:05,680
is you sit with people and you
try to explain your position.

796
00:47:05,681 --> 00:47:07,750
Not trying to drown out people.
I mean that's just,

797
00:47:07,900 --> 00:47:10,490
that's just how it's done in every,
in every sale.

798
00:47:13,160 --> 00:47:13,993
What's that?

799
00:47:19,130 --> 00:47:23,810
You can, yes you can. You're
right. No, but you're right.

800
00:47:23,811 --> 00:47:28,520
You can do it. Notice no one's coming
for you. Nobody's coming for you.

801
00:47:28,521 --> 00:47:32,230
No one's you.
Do you have a question or a comment?

802
00:47:34,730 --> 00:47:36,330
Do you have a question or a comment?

803
00:47:38,350 --> 00:47:39,131
Yeah. All right. I mean,

804
00:47:39,131 --> 00:47:42,100
this is what happens every time and the
but partly what's going on here guys,

805
00:47:42,310 --> 00:47:46,140
is that the reason to critically
think has become so deg degradated.

806
00:47:47,730 --> 00:47:48,530
Okay.

807
00:47:48,530 --> 00:47:49,820
The reason it's become so,

808
00:47:49,860 --> 00:47:54,860
so hurtful to hear words is because
the left has owned all of the places of

809
00:47:56,061 --> 00:47:59,450
learning for so long that every
time someone comes in and says,

810
00:47:59,451 --> 00:48:00,980
I believe in low taxes,

811
00:48:01,190 --> 00:48:04,520
or I believe in something that's a
little bit out of leftist mainstream,

812
00:48:04,700 --> 00:48:08,510
people immediately think that means you
were racist or bigoted or homophobic or

813
00:48:08,511 --> 00:48:11,300
something, and it's, it's
simply isn't the truth.

814
00:48:11,570 --> 00:48:15,020
Learn how to sit with people in a free
society who are a little bit different

815
00:48:15,021 --> 00:48:17,990
than you learn how to sit with
people and change their minds,

816
00:48:18,290 --> 00:48:19,160
but if you think changed,

817
00:48:19,161 --> 00:48:21,890
you're going to change people's minds by
drowning them out. It just doesn't work.

818
00:48:21,891 --> 00:48:23,720
You may get some temporary wins,
right?

819
00:48:23,870 --> 00:48:26,270
You can get some applause and
you can get some temporary wins,

820
00:48:26,510 --> 00:48:31,220
but you will not win in the long term
because you will create a society that

821
00:48:31,221 --> 00:48:35,390
simply will not be tolerant of you one
day because one day you will be on the

822
00:48:35,391 --> 00:48:38,480
other side of it and there will be a
young person that believes in something

823
00:48:38,481 --> 00:48:43,310
that you don't believe in
or believe something that
you think is hate speech and

824
00:48:43,311 --> 00:48:47,540
they will come for you too.
And the only way, the only way,

825
00:48:49,850 --> 00:48:54,140
the only way to ensure protections for
everybody is to make sure that we're all

826
00:48:54,141 --> 00:48:57,290
treated equally under the law. And that's
what, that's what we've got right now.

827
00:48:58,580 --> 00:49:00,890
We've got two more moves from a
white guy over here. What else?

828
00:49:01,790 --> 00:49:02,960
Where are we right over here.

829
00:49:04,930 --> 00:49:08,840
Sorry. Oh, sorry. Um, hi.

830
00:49:08,841 --> 00:49:12,080
So I just had a question just cause I
want to clarify what you said earlier

831
00:49:12,081 --> 00:49:17,081
about how you think we
shouldn't be passing laws
against like speech that could

832
00:49:17,481 --> 00:49:21,170
be hateful or is hateful or whatever
just because it's limiting people's

833
00:49:21,171 --> 00:49:23,320
freedoms.
But I think what I wanted to ask was,

834
00:49:23,321 --> 00:49:27,110
so when you say like limiting
free speech to some degree,

835
00:49:27,111 --> 00:49:29,540
do you think that could mean that you,

836
00:49:29,570 --> 00:49:32,960
once you pass one law that's
limiting one thing for free speech,

837
00:49:32,961 --> 00:49:33,830
then it could turn into,

838
00:49:33,890 --> 00:49:37,280
oh then you're limiting another thing
for free speech and then you like have

839
00:49:37,281 --> 00:49:38,001
this whirlwind of,

840
00:49:38,001 --> 00:49:41,420
then you live in a society where people
just can't say anything because I feel

841
00:49:41,421 --> 00:49:44,270
like it's too,
I guess what's the word I want to use?

842
00:49:44,870 --> 00:49:47,780
It's like up in the air to say that
you can say you can't say this thing.

843
00:49:47,781 --> 00:49:51,440
You can say that thing like absolutely
government has to take a very like

844
00:49:53,340 --> 00:49:55,870
Mitt.
Like you can't just lean on.

845
00:49:55,910 --> 00:49:59,120
I'm trying to say will offend you as a
human being is different than what will

846
00:49:59,121 --> 00:49:59,691
offend me.

847
00:49:59,691 --> 00:50:04,430
So you can't have subjective laws or
leave it up to the mob or to special

848
00:50:04,431 --> 00:50:06,830
interests or any other group to say,
okay,

849
00:50:06,831 --> 00:50:09,710
this is the group of people
we can't say anything about.

850
00:50:09,711 --> 00:50:13,340
Or these are the words you can't say or
these are the people that you account

851
00:50:13,341 --> 00:50:15,920
can't accidentally Miss Gender.
And again,

852
00:50:15,921 --> 00:50:20,921
I say all of that within the framework
of you should and hopefully will be

853
00:50:21,081 --> 00:50:22,220
respectful to people.

854
00:50:22,221 --> 00:50:25,970
You will hopefully treat
people as individuals and be
willing to have friends of

855
00:50:25,971 --> 00:50:28,160
all colors and,
and all of that

856
00:50:28,160 --> 00:50:28,993
stuff.

857
00:50:33,770 --> 00:50:38,570
You guys have a question?
Do you have a question?

858
00:50:39,720 --> 00:50:44,310
You have a question.
Are you guys the problem?

859
00:50:46,430 --> 00:50:49,340
I think, I think you got the point there.
I think you have to play there. Yes,

860
00:50:49,341 --> 00:50:51,800
it is a slippery slope. If you say, okay,

861
00:50:51,990 --> 00:50:53,550
can't say this about x,

862
00:50:53,580 --> 00:50:57,640
someone else is going to say you
can't say they see you there. Okay.

863
00:50:58,170 --> 00:51:00,810
And then I feel like you
could get to a point where

864
00:51:02,610 --> 00:51:06,790
it's just like nothing can be said and I
feel like that's, you actually have you,

865
00:51:06,860 --> 00:51:11,370
you are the problem. You
got, you almost got it.

866
00:51:13,320 --> 00:51:14,220
You almost got it.

867
00:51:17,300 --> 00:51:20,550
You almost got it except for the word not.
Can we try that one?

868
00:51:21,120 --> 00:51:25,630
See? Do you have a question? Perhaps.

869
00:51:26,650 --> 00:51:31,470
Question Group think man, it's
alluring. Alright, we can move on.

870
00:51:31,510 --> 00:51:32,260
We can move on.

871
00:51:32,260 --> 00:51:35,650
I was just gonna say that I feel like
it's once you opened the door for one

872
00:51:35,651 --> 00:51:35,831
thing,

873
00:51:35,831 --> 00:51:39,880
it can be very dicey to enforce things
without infringing on rights because then

874
00:51:39,881 --> 00:51:43,870
you could say that like, oh was saying
everyone should be equal as wrong.

875
00:51:43,900 --> 00:51:48,820
If you had like for example if you had
like a lot of people are concerned that

876
00:51:49,120 --> 00:51:52,150
Trump is a white supremacists because
they were play the quiet game.

877
00:51:52,390 --> 00:51:54,860
You're the quiet game.
Let's see how long you can do it.

878
00:51:55,750 --> 00:51:59,860
If you have people saying like Trump's
a racist, Trump's a white supremacist,

879
00:51:59,861 --> 00:52:03,760
which is like a very fair point to say
because I disagree with like a ton of

880
00:52:03,761 --> 00:52:06,970
this shit. He says he says
like this stupid ass shit ever.

881
00:52:07,360 --> 00:52:11,170
But if those people get in like the
majority of government and then they're

882
00:52:11,171 --> 00:52:14,160
passing laws saying that you
can't preach for equality,

883
00:52:14,300 --> 00:52:16,740
you can't say these things.
Like I feel like it's,

884
00:52:16,820 --> 00:52:19,550
you can't just have these objective laws,
which I like.

885
00:52:19,610 --> 00:52:22,820
That's why we are trying to make,
because you're completely right,

886
00:52:22,880 --> 00:52:25,370
like if you're pushing for
people to make subjective laws,

887
00:52:25,371 --> 00:52:26,810
like hate speech is always wrong,

888
00:52:26,811 --> 00:52:31,811
but then if you have like this majority
sashes like oh totally racist group in

889
00:52:32,511 --> 00:52:34,790
place,
then they're going to try to pass.

890
00:52:34,820 --> 00:52:36,920
Oh well you can say everyone can be equal.

891
00:52:36,950 --> 00:52:40,860
Oh now we're going to have like
white supremacists laws in places.

892
00:52:40,870 --> 00:52:43,730
I like the point you're trying to make.
That is the point I'm trying to make.

893
00:52:43,731 --> 00:52:46,190
You can't,
you can't base laws on subjectivity.

894
00:52:46,191 --> 00:52:47,870
You have to base laws on a quality.

895
00:52:48,170 --> 00:52:52,430
We should have laws in this country that
make every single person in this room

896
00:52:53,030 --> 00:52:56,450
equal. It is as simple
as that. What's that?

897
00:52:59,120 --> 00:53:00,800
Equality does not exist.

898
00:53:09,310 --> 00:53:10,143
Okay,

899
00:53:10,480 --> 00:53:13,800
so can you give me a give me a question
or something that I can respond to that

900
00:53:14,160 --> 00:53:15,730
and I'll,
I'll gladly do that.

901
00:53:18,740 --> 00:53:19,390
What?

902
00:53:19,390 --> 00:53:22,040
What, what, what,

903
00:53:24,770 --> 00:53:29,270
what was the question? You're,
you're allowed. I said I you,

904
00:53:29,271 --> 00:53:31,850
you asked me several times
and I repeatedly said yes.

905
00:53:31,851 --> 00:53:34,130
You're allowed to say hateful things.
It sucks,

906
00:53:34,131 --> 00:53:36,980
but you're allowed to say hateful
things that that's what happens. Okay.

907
00:53:37,280 --> 00:53:38,113
Where are we

908
00:53:39,540 --> 00:53:43,440
down here, James? No,

909
00:53:43,570 --> 00:53:45,040
here we go here and then over there.

910
00:53:45,630 --> 00:53:49,670
Okay.
Someone have a question over here?

911
00:53:53,100 --> 00:53:56,880
Hey Dave, how's it going? I'm
actually a pretty liberal dude.

912
00:53:57,280 --> 00:54:00,900
A lot of my friends are in turning points
site. I came to help them out, but hey,

913
00:54:05,070 --> 00:54:08,190
she knows who your friends
are, not these. Um,

914
00:54:08,880 --> 00:54:10,890
so what I,

915
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:15,090
a lot of this event was supposed to be
surrounding cultural appropriation. Yeah.

916
00:54:15,360 --> 00:54:19,290
Um, and I know that you didn't maybe
get a chance to really dive into that.

917
00:54:19,291 --> 00:54:20,480
I know you talked about like the,

918
00:54:20,481 --> 00:54:25,080
the overarching themes of regarding
the importance of free speech. Yup. Um,

919
00:54:25,170 --> 00:54:27,110
but I know that there's,
there's a lot of, uh,

920
00:54:27,180 --> 00:54:32,040
differences when it comes to a college
campus and how people feel and I know

921
00:54:32,041 --> 00:54:34,530
that on this campus, um, you know,

922
00:54:34,531 --> 00:54:39,090
we can have our disagreements about what
cultural appropriation means or what

923
00:54:39,091 --> 00:54:42,960
role it plays. Um, but there
have been bias incidents.

924
00:54:42,961 --> 00:54:47,820
I think there's been,
uh, you know, things.

925
00:54:47,870 --> 00:54:51,810
Yeah. The things that have happened
that have stemmed from racism and,

926
00:54:51,820 --> 00:54:53,080
and I know that this,

927
00:54:53,081 --> 00:54:55,950
it shouldn't be a government
policy maybe to be implemented,

928
00:54:56,190 --> 00:54:59,700
but what steps do you think
the administration can
take to make sure that we

929
00:54:59,701 --> 00:55:04,701
feel safe but also just as if
not more equally important?

930
00:55:05,400 --> 00:55:09,710
Um, people have the right to free
speech, right? To think what they want.

931
00:55:09,790 --> 00:55:10,001
Well,

932
00:55:10,001 --> 00:55:14,800
I think the only thing that the government
can do is sort of what it has done

933
00:55:14,801 --> 00:55:18,670
generally, which is make sure
that we all have equal laws.

934
00:55:18,671 --> 00:55:23,260
You can't have laws that say x people
can do this and why people can do this.

935
00:55:23,380 --> 00:55:27,430
It's why marriage equality was a
just thing they wanted equal rights,

936
00:55:27,640 --> 00:55:31,300
not separate rights. As for
cultural appropriation, I
mean I would, I would say,

937
00:55:31,480 --> 00:55:34,480
do you think you should be allowed
to put dreadlocks in your hair?

938
00:55:35,260 --> 00:55:36,093
Yes.

939
00:55:36,220 --> 00:55:39,600
Well, so, so my understanding
of it was more to it.

940
00:55:39,670 --> 00:55:41,770
The answer is yes.
The answer is yes.

941
00:55:44,120 --> 00:55:46,420
The answer is yes.
You can do whatever you want.

942
00:55:46,450 --> 00:55:50,290
You can do whatever you want with
your body. You are, it is your body.

943
00:55:50,291 --> 00:55:52,390
It's not their body. You can
do whatever you want. Now.

944
00:55:52,391 --> 00:55:55,780
You can be respectful if you feel that's
going to offend people and you want to

945
00:55:55,781 --> 00:55:59,170
know more about the history of dread
locks and all that. But you if you,

946
00:55:59,290 --> 00:56:02,560
if you pass,
if you pass the capacity.

947
00:56:07,350 --> 00:56:08,183
Okay,

948
00:56:11,030 --> 00:56:12,200
so I've never heard of that.

949
00:56:12,201 --> 00:56:14,710
I would think that that's completely
separate if that's what you're,

950
00:56:14,870 --> 00:56:17,120
I don't know about that specific instance.

951
00:56:17,330 --> 00:56:22,330
So you're telling me you're giving me
an antidotal story that a hospital hired

952
00:56:22,761 --> 00:56:25,780
white with dreadlocks,
but not a black person with dreadlocks.

953
00:56:26,110 --> 00:56:28,930
I would need to know more about that
story, but if you want to send me a link,

954
00:56:28,931 --> 00:56:31,330
I'll gladly look at it. I
mean, I'll gladly look at it.

955
00:56:31,331 --> 00:56:34,000
Of course the hospital shouldn't
be looking at someone's skin color.

956
00:56:37,960 --> 00:56:38,670
So,

957
00:56:38,670 --> 00:56:43,530
so what is what, so what is your, what
is your solution? What is your solution?

958
00:56:48,740 --> 00:56:53,390
Yeah, the solution is all you can do is
create the conditions for more freedom.

959
00:56:53,391 --> 00:56:57,670
And hopefully you can educate people
to be better. That's all you can do.

960
00:56:58,540 --> 00:57:02,270
What so, yeah. So you have to treat,

961
00:57:02,271 --> 00:57:04,250
you have to show people what freedom is.
Just

962
00:57:04,480 --> 00:57:05,890
just to build off the points.

963
00:57:05,891 --> 00:57:09,970
I mean my understanding was that cultural
appropriation and especially the,

964
00:57:09,971 --> 00:57:13,030
the debates that we've had over at here,
yeah.

965
00:57:13,070 --> 00:57:17,470
Stemmed more from intentionally putting
people down or attacking people that

966
00:57:17,660 --> 00:57:20,950
wear a lot of the frustration I
think has come from. Yeah. Um,

967
00:57:21,160 --> 00:57:23,540
my question I guess was
more directed to you.

968
00:57:23,920 --> 00:57:28,600
Do you think that a university has a
little bit more of a role to play? Um,

969
00:57:28,630 --> 00:57:29,463
then then the governor

970
00:57:29,730 --> 00:57:32,090
in the university can have
a code of conduct, right.

971
00:57:32,120 --> 00:57:35,900
Especially a private university can have
all sorts of codes of conduct and say

972
00:57:35,901 --> 00:57:39,530
if you treat your fellow student this way
or you treat your fellow students that

973
00:57:39,531 --> 00:57:39,980
way,

974
00:57:39,980 --> 00:57:43,160
that we are not going to allow you to be
a part of this university or you won't

975
00:57:43,161 --> 00:57:45,950
be able to be part of the
Greek system or whatever it is.

976
00:57:46,220 --> 00:57:48,440
But also that's consistent
with everything else I believe,

977
00:57:48,441 --> 00:57:51,710
which is that it should be about
local control. So you should ever,

978
00:57:51,740 --> 00:57:52,910
in every situation,

979
00:57:52,911 --> 00:57:56,840
the best way for you to be
governed is by your own community.

980
00:57:57,080 --> 00:58:00,860
Every right. We shouldn't be handing off
everything to the federal government.

981
00:58:01,100 --> 00:58:04,610
So I think one of the one,
what's that?

982
00:58:04,780 --> 00:58:05,613
Huh?

983
00:58:07,370 --> 00:58:11,680
You think you're doing right now?
Right now,

984
00:58:11,681 --> 00:58:14,170
if it was up to the states,
we would have slavery.

985
00:58:14,200 --> 00:58:15,960
Yeah.

986
00:58:18,750 --> 00:58:23,170
Well, yes. Yeah. Well,
I'll talk to you about it.

987
00:58:26,100 --> 00:58:28,860
I'm going to deny the civil ward.
No, I'm not going to deny the civil

988
00:58:31,570 --> 00:58:34,970
beauty of the states. I would
recommend, I would recommend a,

989
00:58:34,971 --> 00:58:36,560
an interview I did with Randy Barnett,

990
00:58:36,561 --> 00:58:38,960
who is a constitutional law
professor at Georgetown.

991
00:58:39,140 --> 00:58:43,460
And what he talks about is the beauty
of the states is that because we have 50

992
00:58:43,461 --> 00:58:46,670
states, you, if you don't like
what's happening in your state,

993
00:58:46,850 --> 00:58:48,740
you can move to another state.

994
00:58:49,130 --> 00:58:53,150
You can move to another state if you,
if California,

995
00:58:53,151 --> 00:58:54,790
I live in California there.
Hold on.

996
00:58:55,840 --> 00:59:00,840
[inaudible] what's that?

997
00:59:03,260 --> 00:59:07,260
[inaudible]

998
00:59:07,350 --> 00:59:11,560
I, I'm not even really sure where
we're debating here. I assure you,

999
00:59:11,561 --> 00:59:16,210
I am against slavery.
I am 100% for equality for everyone.

1000
00:59:16,600 --> 00:59:20,270
So I don't, I don't know exactly what
we're, what we're debating here. Yeah.

1001
00:59:20,630 --> 00:59:25,340
I [inaudible] right on brother.
Right. Why don't we go this way?

1002
00:59:26,580 --> 00:59:27,413
Go down here.

1003
00:59:32,130 --> 00:59:32,401
Yeah.

1004
00:59:32,401 --> 00:59:37,210
Could I just hear your
thoughts on intellectual
royalism intellectual pluralism

1005
00:59:37,211 --> 00:59:39,360
and that we should have a
plethora of ideas. Yeah.

1006
00:59:39,420 --> 00:59:42,990
Every idea should be able to compete in
the market. Yes, of course. Of course.

1007
00:59:42,991 --> 00:59:45,150
I'm for all of these people
expressing their ideas,

1008
00:59:45,151 --> 00:59:48,630
what you can't do is just drown out
other people from expressing theirs.

1009
00:59:49,700 --> 00:59:52,860
All right.
Yeah.

1010
00:59:54,730 --> 00:59:56,830
Okay. I mean, I'm for
anything. I mean, look,

1011
00:59:56,831 --> 01:00:00,250
you could tell me we could sit there and
anyone here is welcoming and that's why

1012
01:00:00,251 --> 01:00:01,180
we do Q and A's,
right?

1013
01:00:01,181 --> 01:00:04,480
It's for anyone to share their views and
then I can share my views and then you

1014
01:00:04,481 --> 01:00:06,880
go back and forth and then you
figure out what the best ideas are.

1015
01:00:07,120 --> 01:00:08,560
That's the beauty of free speech.
No one,

1016
01:00:08,561 --> 01:00:11,890
I'm not here to teach you guys what
to think if you disagree with me.

1017
01:00:11,891 --> 01:00:15,190
That's great. I just want us to be able
to live in the same society together.

1018
01:00:15,370 --> 01:00:16,570
I mean that,
that's it.

1019
01:00:16,660 --> 01:00:19,510
We should have the same laws so that
we can exist in the same society.

1020
01:00:19,511 --> 01:00:22,690
But of course, of course we should
worry about to be debating ideas.

1021
01:00:29,760 --> 01:00:30,593
Yeah.

1022
01:00:32,530 --> 01:00:36,100
Yes. Joe Being on the
left, being progressive's,

1023
01:00:36,340 --> 01:00:39,880
do you feel threatened
when you leave here? Well,

1024
01:00:39,881 --> 01:00:44,881
generally speaking in America in 2018
the left an Antifa is more violent than

1025
01:00:46,331 --> 01:00:51,070
the same version on the right. Yeah, but
I'm not, I don't think you're going to do,

1026
01:00:51,430 --> 01:00:53,020
I don't think you're going
to do anything to me.

1027
01:00:53,021 --> 01:00:54,610
You don't seem to like me very much.

1028
01:00:54,930 --> 01:00:57,950
[inaudible]

1029
01:00:58,050 --> 01:01:00,540
I'm not a victim. I'll be all
right. I mean, I'm pretty quick.

1030
01:01:00,541 --> 01:01:04,290
I can move on my feet.
I'll be all right. Yeah.

1031
01:01:04,291 --> 01:01:06,070
I don't think you are going to.

1032
01:01:08,680 --> 01:01:09,513
Yeah,

1033
01:01:11,960 --> 01:01:12,830
I don't think any,

1034
01:01:12,831 --> 01:01:16,160
I don't think there's any
reason to believe that any
of the people who have sat

1035
01:01:16,161 --> 01:01:17,960
here respectfully and quietly,

1036
01:01:19,400 --> 01:01:24,380
so you think people outside are going
to come for the people in this room

1037
01:01:27,750 --> 01:01:32,750
on a regular basis actually
attacked people of color I do.

1038
01:01:33,061 --> 01:01:35,880
Or minorities or people
that are transgender. Right.

1039
01:01:35,881 --> 01:01:39,930
And we have laws against all of those
things as we should, as we should,

1040
01:01:40,650 --> 01:01:41,483
as we should.

1041
01:01:43,690 --> 01:01:46,850
[inaudible] so

1042
01:01:49,390 --> 01:01:52,270
we have laws about those things.
I mean, it doesn't mean that

1043
01:01:53,770 --> 01:01:55,990
it doesn't mean that
the system is perfect.

1044
01:01:56,050 --> 01:01:59,860
It doesn't mean that the
system is perfect, but we
have laws about those things.

1045
01:02:07,240 --> 01:02:10,450
Um, I really don't have a question
for you because you don't answer them,

1046
01:02:10,451 --> 01:02:11,370
so I'm just going to say this.

1047
01:02:12,290 --> 01:02:13,123
MMM.

1048
01:02:14,970 --> 01:02:19,260
You said you said La Ronda, um,
discipline quarter, boom, guys,

1049
01:02:19,290 --> 01:02:23,150
hate speech was not a thing,
but we know discipline cost plus a fee,

1050
01:02:23,160 --> 01:02:23,970
faggots scene.

1051
01:02:23,970 --> 01:02:28,560
They would for a dred Scott and the hood
for a ton of things that pretty much

1052
01:02:28,561 --> 01:02:32,990
put people of color and people of color
across the United States in jeopardy.

1053
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:36,840
They've made this feel like second class
citizens and it's actually legalized

1054
01:02:36,841 --> 01:02:38,330
slavery.
They did a lot of discipline codes,

1055
01:02:38,331 --> 01:02:40,770
did a lot of things that
make people of color in this,

1056
01:02:40,890 --> 01:02:44,160
in this United States feel like
they were not part of the country.

1057
01:02:44,161 --> 01:02:46,700
So when you talk about how,
um, when you talk about this,

1058
01:02:46,701 --> 01:02:50,160
because doing this and doing
that and showing that, um,
when you talk about this,

1059
01:02:50,161 --> 01:02:53,960
we've got to saying that we don't add
that there is no such thing as, as, um,

1060
01:02:54,180 --> 01:02:56,040
when you call it again as hate speech,

1061
01:02:56,080 --> 01:02:59,010
it doesn't make any sense because it's
of course has no more style than if

1062
01:02:59,011 --> 01:03:00,570
they've been moving things that are wrong,

1063
01:03:00,750 --> 01:03:03,750
which means that you have no point
bringing up the supreme courts as a moral

1064
01:03:03,751 --> 01:03:06,730
standards of saying that something exists
when it doesn't because it's would be

1065
01:03:06,731 --> 01:03:11,100
code does not rule anything that
makes any sense anymore. Well there,

1066
01:03:11,101 --> 01:03:12,950
there was a lot of things in
there that I didn't quite say,

1067
01:03:12,951 --> 01:03:16,040
but I would agree that the supreme
court in and of itself is not the moral

1068
01:03:16,041 --> 01:03:20,000
arbiter and absolutely,
they absolutely can. Well,

1069
01:03:20,001 --> 01:03:24,110
because we're a nation of laws, we can
debate. We can debate. Hold on, hold on.

1070
01:03:24,111 --> 01:03:24,944
I let you ask.

1071
01:03:30,940 --> 01:03:35,390
So yeah. Yes.

1072
01:03:35,420 --> 01:03:39,050
So just moving back on the first time
when you came in and when you started

1073
01:03:39,051 --> 01:03:42,580
talking, you talked about
how we had the, the, the,

1074
01:03:42,680 --> 01:03:46,760
the statue of liberty and how does such
a deliverance, he said big into your ma,

1075
01:03:46,790 --> 01:03:49,340
your poor masses heard the message
and they were separate. They mean,

1076
01:03:49,341 --> 01:03:52,880
and then you went further on to say that
we shouldn't have an open bar there and

1077
01:03:52,881 --> 01:03:56,180
we should allow illegal immigrants into
the country, which is basically just

1078
01:03:57,860 --> 01:04:01,090
you're contradicting yourself. And then
you talked about Canada's always and I,

1079
01:04:01,100 --> 01:04:05,150
you said how can this always was being
supported by chaos and how that's a great

1080
01:04:05,151 --> 01:04:06,400
thing. And He, I've,

1081
01:04:06,580 --> 01:04:09,820
there's a youtube video of John can just
always talking about how celebrities,

1082
01:04:09,821 --> 01:04:12,440
you're not fucking speak because she
doesn't care about their opinions.

1083
01:04:12,590 --> 01:04:15,320
So basically you standing there and you
say something that is super critical

1084
01:04:15,440 --> 01:04:17,510
because they can just watch you're
talking about doesn't take the celebrities

1085
01:04:17,511 --> 01:04:18,344
have the right to speak,

1086
01:04:18,470 --> 01:04:21,800
which means that you should even be
using waste as a moral standard or

1087
01:04:21,801 --> 01:04:24,800
discipline quarters in
neuroscience because all these
people are people we know.

1088
01:04:24,800 --> 01:04:25,880
That used to be shit.

1089
01:04:25,970 --> 01:04:29,690
So what you're saying would you be saying
so far is based on crap cause it makes

1090
01:04:29,691 --> 01:04:33,600
no fucking sense. My friend, I, I assume
you didn't watch my show this week.

1091
01:04:33,601 --> 01:04:35,130
I did a video a,

1092
01:04:36,510 --> 01:04:40,290
I did a video about how you can't
take kinase word for Gospel,

1093
01:04:40,291 --> 01:04:44,870
but what he did do was give a little room.
He gave wait a little bit.

1094
01:04:45,290 --> 01:04:47,400
This is the, he might find
Chris, I let you speak.

1095
01:04:47,401 --> 01:04:51,000
So let me answer you and then we'll,
we'll do it again. So that he,

1096
01:04:51,230 --> 01:04:54,690
that Kanye offered a little oxygen for
people to think a little bit differently

1097
01:04:54,720 --> 01:04:57,000
in the video that I did
just a few days ago. I said,

1098
01:04:57,150 --> 01:05:00,750
I don't know what his political beliefs
are and he might say something crazy

1099
01:05:00,751 --> 01:05:04,410
tomorrow. So you can't take him
as if he's the no. All in the end.

1100
01:05:04,411 --> 01:05:08,060
All and the be all though. I
bring him up. Well because people,

1101
01:05:08,220 --> 01:05:12,450
because ideas matter. People matter.
He's a, whether you like Kanye or not,

1102
01:05:12,451 --> 01:05:16,910
he's a mover of culture. He's
someone that moves culture. Wow. No,

1103
01:05:17,650 --> 01:05:18,840
I think the,
the,

1104
01:05:18,860 --> 01:05:23,620
the basic thing in this room right now
is that we have people like you who go

1105
01:05:23,621 --> 01:05:26,320
around talking about things
they have no clue about.

1106
01:05:26,510 --> 01:05:31,180
You pretty good handle on this
stuff. So you, you don't, you don't,

1107
01:05:31,181 --> 01:05:34,450
you pretty much they'll understand the
plight of people of color across the

1108
01:05:34,451 --> 01:05:39,160
country. So why do we have that? That
is a against you. That's not against me.

1109
01:05:39,250 --> 01:05:43,290
Really. Yeah. Really. So
for example, um, there were,

1110
01:05:43,360 --> 01:05:46,840
there was a case of a student
athletes, um, Tuesdays athletes,

1111
01:05:46,850 --> 01:05:49,780
the committee that they had the rape case.
One was black and one was white.

1112
01:05:49,781 --> 01:05:52,120
One good three months in changes.
The other one got 18 years.

1113
01:05:52,210 --> 01:05:56,310
So that shows you the one who got his
fingers was black at home. We Myers White,

1114
01:05:56,640 --> 01:05:59,680
white people, excuse me, excuse
me, white people in this country.

1115
01:05:59,700 --> 01:06:03,250
I've been known to get less sentences for
the same clients coming to us as black

1116
01:06:03,251 --> 01:06:06,630
people. So that shows that the justice
system in itself is basically flows,

1117
01:06:06,870 --> 01:06:09,100
which means reforming the justice system.

1118
01:06:09,101 --> 01:06:10,780
I've done plenty of videos about that too.

1119
01:06:10,980 --> 01:06:13,010
But you're just saying
that we have the rock.

1120
01:06:13,240 --> 01:06:14,460
So what's the whole point of before,

1121
01:06:14,650 --> 01:06:16,180
why would you want to read
from a law that works?

1122
01:06:16,181 --> 01:06:17,890
You basically speaking from
two sides of your mouth,

1123
01:06:17,891 --> 01:06:20,140
you don't know what you're talking about.
We

1124
01:06:21,880 --> 01:06:26,710
listen my friend, I am completely
down. Okay. We're not friends.

1125
01:06:26,740 --> 01:06:30,940
Fine. I am completely down to
reform the prison justice system.

1126
01:06:31,210 --> 01:06:32,890
I am completely down to reform that

1127
01:06:36,980 --> 01:06:40,610
because I asked you because laws and the
justice system are not exactly the same

1128
01:06:40,611 --> 01:06:41,040
thing.

1129
01:06:41,040 --> 01:06:46,040
[inaudible] love it.

1130
01:06:46,370 --> 01:06:49,850
No, well you're talking about is that
perhaps black people don't have access to

1131
01:06:49,851 --> 01:06:51,580
better lawyers because of sociopath

1132
01:06:51,640 --> 01:06:56,520
anomic reasons and a zillion other
things. No, it's not that. Okay.

1133
01:06:56,610 --> 01:07:01,240
Okay. All right. How you doing? Good.

1134
01:07:02,080 --> 01:07:03,470
Yep.
Yeah.

1135
01:07:11,320 --> 01:07:12,153
Can I hold it?

1136
01:07:12,290 --> 01:07:13,970
All right. Hi. Hi. Um,

1137
01:07:13,980 --> 01:07:18,150
so I know that you mentioned that our
country was not founded on identity

1138
01:07:18,151 --> 01:07:22,370
politics. However, I want to note that
women, people of color and other, my,

1139
01:07:22,420 --> 01:07:26,100
my July's identities were not written
into history and therefore in the

1140
01:07:26,101 --> 01:07:27,810
foundation of our country for that matter.

1141
01:07:28,440 --> 01:07:32,010
So my question here is how do you think
everyone is equal and represented if

1142
01:07:32,011 --> 01:07:34,650
this country was founded on
the premises of exclusion?

1143
01:07:35,170 --> 01:07:40,170
So [inaudible] no,

1144
01:07:47,020 --> 01:07:49,840
so I, I've talked about
this a lot. Look, is there,

1145
01:07:49,841 --> 01:07:52,870
is there any question that George
Washington, Thomas Jefferson,

1146
01:07:52,871 --> 01:07:54,970
that many of the other
founders owned slaves.

1147
01:07:54,971 --> 01:07:57,490
Thomas Jefferson owned
slaves until the day he died.

1148
01:07:57,491 --> 01:08:02,020
He had an affair with at least one
slave while at the very w wait, hold on.

1149
01:08:02,021 --> 01:08:03,790
While at the very same time,

1150
01:08:03,910 --> 01:08:07,480
while at the very same time he was writing
the laws that ultimately would free

1151
01:08:07,481 --> 01:08:10,810
the slaves. So is he
a, is he a perfect man?

1152
01:08:11,860 --> 01:08:15,950
Is he a perfect man? He is not
George Washington. The day died, his,

1153
01:08:16,100 --> 01:08:19,880
his half of the slaves were freed,
but Martha Washington kept her half.

1154
01:08:19,910 --> 01:08:24,680
Is that just, is that just, is that right?
No, but these people, I would say this,

1155
01:08:24,710 --> 01:08:28,990
go to the Jefferson Memorial in DC.
It's a little off the beaten path and,

1156
01:08:28,991 --> 01:08:33,350
and read and read those documents there.
And these flawed people who are just,

1157
01:08:33,351 --> 01:08:34,430
people have their time.

1158
01:08:34,640 --> 01:08:38,390
They were writing the documents that
would ultimately give more freedom to more

1159
01:08:38,391 --> 01:08:41,210
people than any other country
in the history of the world.

1160
01:08:41,211 --> 01:08:43,280
It doesn't mean it doesn't mean,

1161
01:08:43,640 --> 01:08:46,550
it doesn't mean that they were always
right and it doesn't mean that they,

1162
01:08:46,551 --> 01:08:48,680
that they didn't have their
own prejudices that, but they,

1163
01:08:48,681 --> 01:08:52,420
it means that they were people who
grew up in a certain time. And if, if,

1164
01:08:52,440 --> 01:08:57,200
if the goal is to always destroy the
history to make a future that you think is

1165
01:08:57,201 --> 01:08:59,810
better, you will lose a
lot by getting rid of that.

1166
01:09:00,080 --> 01:09:03,890
So I would say they were imperfect
people who wrote some laws and wrote the

1167
01:09:03,891 --> 01:09:08,390
basic foundation of the constitution and
the bill of rights that have guaranteed

1168
01:09:08,391 --> 01:09:11,600
more freedoms to more people
than anywhere else. I think.

1169
01:09:15,420 --> 01:09:18,000
Hi, last one, last one. Big Finish ruble.

1170
01:09:20,190 --> 01:09:20,820
Yep.

1171
01:09:20,820 --> 01:09:21,750
So,
um,

1172
01:09:21,810 --> 01:09:25,460
I just want to say real quick that
Thomas Jefferson was the third president,

1173
01:09:25,470 --> 01:09:29,700
right? And you're saying
that him in Washington, we
writing laws to free slaves,

1174
01:09:29,850 --> 01:09:32,620
but it wasn't until the 16th
president that those slaves wasn't,

1175
01:09:32,640 --> 01:09:37,140
you weren't even free around the 45th
president and we're still dying every day.

1176
01:09:37,260 --> 01:09:39,750
There was just a person that
was linked two days ago.

1177
01:09:39,810 --> 01:09:42,180
So I don't want to hear this
bullshit about hates me.

1178
01:09:42,181 --> 01:09:47,040
Do not freeze beach a quality exists.
Nothing because this, it does it for you.

1179
01:09:47,041 --> 01:09:48,450
It does.
Because you have privilege.

1180
01:09:48,451 --> 01:09:52,740
The fact that you can stand here and
talk about the fact that people can say

1181
01:09:52,741 --> 01:09:57,510
slurs to you at whatever and you
can just walk outside. It's okay.

1182
01:09:57,700 --> 01:10:00,480
No. If someone calls me
the n word, I can get shot.

1183
01:10:00,540 --> 01:10:04,230
So don't be telling me right now that it
doesn't exist and that's all I have to

1184
01:10:04,231 --> 01:10:04,960
say.

1185
01:10:04,960 --> 01:10:09,230
Okay,
I'm bad node.

1186
01:10:10,820 --> 01:10:13,980
All right? You know what Frito guys,
I've actually totally enjoyed this.

1187
01:10:13,990 --> 01:10:18,090
This is business one. It's all about that.
All right, settle down. You don't own me.

1188
01:10:18,330 --> 01:10:22,280
You know what I mean?
Relaxed Lady. Um, uh,

1189
01:10:22,710 --> 01:10:25,050
I've actually really enjoyed this.
This is what it's all about. And,

1190
01:10:25,051 --> 01:10:28,080
and whether you disagreed with
everything I said, are you agreed?

1191
01:10:28,740 --> 01:10:31,980
We did a little something here.
You know what? And, uh, and I hope,

1192
01:10:31,981 --> 01:10:35,250
I hope perhaps that I changed some of
your minds and perhaps some of those guys

1193
01:10:35,251 --> 01:10:38,790
change, change your minds. And either
way, either way, it's all good.

1194
01:10:38,791 --> 01:10:42,060
As long as we don't walk out of here at
each other's throats and hurting each

1195
01:10:42,061 --> 01:10:46,500
other than Ben. It's
actually, yeah, I don't sense.

1196
01:10:46,650 --> 01:10:49,020
I don't sense that any
of these calm people.

1197
01:10:54,160 --> 01:10:55,180
No problem.

1198
01:10:55,790 --> 01:10:58,870
All right, I'll grant you that guys, guys.

1199
01:10:58,871 --> 01:11:01,960
We're not gonna create any acts of
violence against any of these people here

1200
01:11:01,961 --> 01:11:04,480
tonight. All right, well, I
have enjoyed this for real.

1201
01:11:04,810 --> 01:11:09,610
Hopefully next time Candice in, uh, and
Charlie will join for the festivities and,

1202
01:11:09,611 --> 01:11:13,570
uh, where do people get a beer here in
New Hampshire? I'll find out about that.

1203
01:11:13,710 --> 01:11:14,620
All right.
Thank you guys.
