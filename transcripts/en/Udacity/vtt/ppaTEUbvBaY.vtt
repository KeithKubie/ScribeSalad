00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:03.646
Returning the total score for one student wasn't too bad. I bet we could return

00:00:03.646 --> 00:00:08.163
an array with the totals for all of the students. So going back to this

00:00:08.163 --> 00:00:11.201
example, here we would want to return an array with three elements, one for

00:00:11.201 --> 00:00:16.960
each student. The first one would be five plus six plus seven. The second would

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:20.970
be six plus eight plus seven, and the third would be four plus six plus five.

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:25.672
In BlueJ, implement the method totalsForAllStudents.
