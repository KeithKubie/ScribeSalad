00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.769
When we send a mission to Mars to search for
ancient life, where should it land?

00:00:03.769 --> 00:00:09.840
A crater filled with glass… yes, GLASS…
might be a good place to start.

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:16.440
Hello, I’m Ian O’Neill, space producer
for Discovery News and today I wanted to take

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:18.710
a quick trip onto the tantalizing surface
of Mars.

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:22.770
As depicted in the AWESOME-looking trailer
for the new Matt Damon movie “The Martian,”

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:25.430
the Red planet looks like a barren and poisonous
place.

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:27.960
To survive, Damon’s character, astronaut
MARK WATNEY, must “science the shit” out

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:31.580
of his temporary habitat to survive after
being left for dead by his crew.

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:35.359
But as our armada of space robots are showing
us, Mars hasn’t always been the dry and

00:00:35.359 --> 00:00:39.780
deadly environment it is now -- Mars was once
a wet world containing the ingredients for

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:43.370
life and it looks like meteorite craters may
be the best place to look for any ancient

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:45.940
lifeforms that could have evolved millions
of years ago.

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:49.500
We all know that the Red Planet is littered
with craters and interesting geological features,

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:52.940
and it just so happens that NASA’s getting
very familiar with the minerals that cover

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:54.269
the Martian surface.

00:00:54.269 --> 00:00:57.909
In new research, one particular instrument
on board NASA’s Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter

00:00:57.909 --> 00:01:02.079
called CRISM has been used to look deep into
a few impact craters to look for glass.

00:01:02.079 --> 00:01:03.429
But why glass?

00:01:03.429 --> 00:01:08.110
Well, in 2014, researchers headed by Brown
University found glass deposits at the bottom

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:11.960
of an Argentinian meteorite impact crater
that was formed millions of years ago.

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:15.610
Entombed inside this glass was organic material
that was existing at the site when the meteorite

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:16.610
hit Earth.

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:20.720
Glass can form when minerals in rock are exposed
to sudden heating -- so the extreme impact

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:24.590
pressures and searing heat generated during
a meteorite impact can produce certain types

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:25.810
of glasses.

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:30.170
Like those Jurassic era mosquitos entombed
inside amber, any ancient organic matter can

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:34.640
be “frozen in time” within this glass,
providing us with a cool look into a biological

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:36.990
time capsule dating back millions of years.

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:42.070
So, by turning their gaze to Mars, researchers
pondered whether Mars also has glass in its

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:46.650
craters, potentially also containing biosignatures
of hypothetical ancient Mars life.

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:50.310
But the spectroscopic signature of glass on
Mars is very hard to detect.

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:54.520
In an effort to confront this, the Brown team
put similar powdered minerals found on Mars

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:57.000
into an oven and heated it to form glass in
the lab.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.950
They then studied light reflected off the
lab glass to measure its spectroscopic fingerprint.

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:06.490
Then, using CRISM, the researchers sought
out regions on Mars that generated a similar

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:08.979
fingerprint when compared with the lab sample.

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:12.540
And then they saw it, craters on Mars containing
glassy material!

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:15.959
The most exciting thing is that one of the
craters found to contain glass is HARGRAVES

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:19.709
CRATER near NILI FOSSAE, a 400-mile-long trough
in the Martian surface.

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:23.010
And it just so happens that this is one of
the landing site options for NASA’s Mars

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:24.870
2020 sample return mission.

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:26.230
Should the rover find glass in that area,
and might we be able to analyse the stuff

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:29.819
the samples contain, could the glass have
the fossilized remains of ancient Mars microbes

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:30.819
inside?

00:02:30.819 --> 00:02:32.970
Who knows, but it would be cool to find out.

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:36.330
Do you think we should send a manned expedition
to search for Mars fossils?

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:39.959
