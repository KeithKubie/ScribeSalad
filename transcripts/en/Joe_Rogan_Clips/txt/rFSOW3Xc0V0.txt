Go to these different environments and yourself too. Yeah, yeah. There are different and they're different foods or different art. There are different architecture and he goes, oh, this is also possible to, yes, people can live like this. Yes. And do you even begin to see why they live like that? You know, like you initially you go to Greece and you have resin flavored wine, you have it at Siena and a, you wondering why would these crazy Greeks put pine resin in there ruining perfectly good white wine. And then after awhile you start to say, Hey, actually this is pretty good. Uh, you know, this is not a crazy thing after all. And he acquired case. Yes. You know, the first time, the first time I had scotch whiskey, I, I, uh, I didn't know what I thought about it.

Speaker 1:          00:46          And now I love whiskey. Right. It's an acquired taste. So the first time you drink something like that, you think, you know? Yes. They put resident, they put pine resin in their white wine. They chill it. I should've brought you some. Maybe I'll send you on an acquired taste. What's not Ouzo Koolaid. It's delicious. Just from the beginning. Yeah. I just write out a job cold and it's a sweet good. Yes, yes, yes. We'll have to convince anybody. Yes, that's right. That's right. Somethings that's right. Some things are just good right out of the budget is good. Yes. Koolaid is just good. Yeah. I mean, I don't recommend you drink it all the time. It's full of Shit. It's terrible for you.

No, I'm uh, I'm not sure about what I should mention, but anyway, I love Popeye's fried chicken. I do as well. I love it so bad. It's awful. And my wife, my wife is unlikely to listen to this full podcast, so, or I'll, I'll skip over this part so she doesn't hear this part, but, and my sister will be listening probably, and so she will laugh when she gets to this part because whenever I see about my eyes, I just pull over and indulge myself and then I terrible. Terrible. The top eyes is good, but you know what? If you really want to indulge and you like chicken. Yeah. Roscoe's is [inaudible]. No, you don't know. No, I don't know. Chicken and waffles. Oh Dude. I tried to go the chicken and waffle family.

Speaker 1:          02:13          We tried it. Don't you make that face? Tried to go there the other day with my family on a Sunday, hour and a half. Wait on the same plate. Sunday chicken and walls course on the same plate. What are you a communist? Yeah, man, it's, it's La Syrup on them to hell. Yeah. And butter. Yeah. You mean the shooting is put it on there. Yes.

I have a, yeah, exactly. Giving people a hard time for waffles and chicken again. The colonel, the colonel is a liar. He does not have it. Get out of here. It's not even the colonel. The colonel is norm Macdonald's. I saw it's not no. The old one kernel. It's normally very like promotion or something.

Speaker 1:          03:03          That is nonsense. Yeah. But they do not, oh my gosh. I can waffle syrup goes on top of the chicken that chicken and waffles and chicken tastes like cat litter compared to Roscoe's. Also sweet chick La. He could try to get this out of here. Uh, so, uh, it's stuff can go fuck off Roscoe's chicken and waffles and you get the Greens to the Collard Greens. Collard Greens. Yeah, that's fine. Damn good. That's fine. But that's a waste of maple syrup. Take it from a man who makes it up to put her sweet chick is good. I'm sure. Sweet. It's not this place. I get it. I love it. I've been there. It's great. Roscoe's. Okay, I'll have a look fuck off. Cause the reason why there's an hour and a half wait on a Sunday. Okay. How long you in town for a just a day babe. I'll be back though.

Been in La since you left the Massachusetts? No, I went to New York for a couple of years then I moved down here, moved down here in [inaudible] 94 okay, so you've been here a long time and when I was on news radio they got it for like you could order lunch and someone ordered Roscoe, she became addicted and I was like, what is this like waffles? And it was just like you waffles and chicken. There it looks. That's, that's, that doesn't look as good as it looks when you're there. When you're there and you smell it, it's damn good. Sorry, I'm doing a Roscoe's commercial here with an incredible, I'm a fan. It's an incredible combination of items based, so it's so good. And afterwards you better have nothing to do, man, into a food coma son.

Speaker 1:          04:42          Anyway. Um, how do we get to that? W W I know, try you. Maple Syrup stories, different countries, different countries in opening your mind. So you resident. Yeah. So you are counteracting my resin flavored white wine with these maple syrup, syrup and gas chicken.
