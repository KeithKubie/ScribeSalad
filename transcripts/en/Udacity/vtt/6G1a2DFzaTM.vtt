00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:03.620
In scenarios where we don't have very much data, or

00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:06.910
where removing our missing values would compromise the representativeness of

00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:09.530
our sample, it might not make sense to throw away

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:12.780
a bunch of our entries just because they're missing values.

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:16.230
This could severely impact the statistical power of whatever analysis

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:19.460
we were trying to perform. In this case, it likely

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:21.700
makes sense to make an intelligent guess at the missing

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:25.710
values in our data. The process of approximating these missing

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:29.000
values is referred to as imputation. There are many

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.910
different ways to impute missing values. And different techniques

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:35.470
are constantly being developed. I want to quickly discuss

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:38.280
some relatively simple ways to impute missing values in our

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:41.570
data. Let's note that imputation is a really hard

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:44.390
problem. Each of the methods we'll discuss introduce a

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:48.530
certain biases or inaccuracies into your data set. We're

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:51.450
discussing some of the most simple ways to impute data,

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:54.610
but much more sophisticated and robust methods are out there.
