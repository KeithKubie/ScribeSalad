00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:05.340
The Joe Rogan experience.
Yeah.
But he's sending a mountain lion.
Yeah.

2
00:00:05.341 --> 00:00:06.630
Well you know,
one just died,

3
00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:11.430
a famous one just died where I got a text from Manila out here.
Um,
he,
uh,

4
00:00:11.431 --> 00:00:15.750
eight some rat poison.
Oh Shit.
Yeah.
That's a real problem with rat poison man.

5
00:00:15.751 --> 00:00:18.920
Rat poison doesn't just affect rats.
You know,

6
00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:23.460
there's like there's secondary and my dog this tied that way.
Yeah.

7
00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:28.290
And what it does is the rat poison I think stops you from producing vitamin K in

8
00:00:28.291 --> 00:00:31.220
your body,
which is like,
which is how you clot blood.
Oh.

9
00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:33.150
So they just bleed internally.

10
00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:36.420
So my dog yet load of it and they pumped his stomach,

11
00:00:36.421 --> 00:00:40.440
gave him charcoal and then he had to take vitaminK supplements for a long time.

12
00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:44.130
Wow.
Yeah.
Yeah.
The people,

13
00:00:44.131 --> 00:00:48.630
they poison the rats than things eat the rats,
you know?

14
00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:53.620
Yeah.
This a mountain lion is a famous mountain lion collared one.

15
00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:55.170
The tracking.
Yeah.
Out here.

16
00:00:55.171 --> 00:00:58.830
A number ever Rinella texted me about it and then I looked into it.
Oh,

17
00:00:58.831 --> 00:01:01.860
you got it there.
What does,
which number does it say here?

18
00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:05.940
47 [inaudible] 47 is not the one that they spotted at the not,
no.

19
00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:09.720
This one's only three.
We were going to get a photo of that,
right?
Yeah,

20
00:01:09.721 --> 00:01:13.010
let's do that.
Oh yeah.
We tracked it down.
Yeah.

21
00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:17.830
What happened is expensive.
Yeah,
let's,
let's do that though.

22
00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:21.510
Let me know after the show.
Which one you wanted.
The artist's proof,

23
00:01:21.511 --> 00:01:24.210
whatever we got that detail of it or whatever.
Yeah,

24
00:01:24.211 --> 00:01:26.730
because that one photo that they caught of it.

25
00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:31.050
Have you seen that photo of the lion with the Hollywood sign behind it?
No.

26
00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:34.920
It's amazing.
It's one of the best.
It's an,
again,

27
00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:39.390
it's so fucking human cause this line has a collar on it like it's got bling on

28
00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:43.430
stand in front of the Hollywood sign and it's as big as fuck.
It's all that.

29
00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:47.310
It's like 150 a mile a minute.
Oh,
that's amazing.
Look at that photo.

30
00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.950
That looks stage looked staged.
By the way.

31
00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:52.800
Look at the look at the muscles plead it's forearms.
Yeah.

32
00:01:52.801 --> 00:01:55.890
That's a ridiculous animal.
That's one thing that people don't,

33
00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:59.490
I don't think you've realized like that's not a [inaudible] thing.
Like a house.

34
00:01:59.491 --> 00:02:02.210
That's a lion,
sir.
They have enormous forearms.
Yeah.

35
00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:06.960
It's a lion that ways putting down an elk.
I bet that's 130 pounds.
Yeah.

36
00:02:06.961 --> 00:02:10.320
Maybe 150 think about how big that is.
That doesn't seem big,

37
00:02:10.321 --> 00:02:15.140
but you see a rottweiler,
a police dog like that or shepherd 90 pounds.

38
00:02:15.141 --> 00:02:18.990
Yeah.
Good luck.
Yeah,
good luck.
That's an add.
Add another 60 pounds.

39
00:02:18.991 --> 00:02:23.490
40 pounds of,
that's a big animal,
man.
Yeah.

40
00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:26.910
Such a big animal and they're just wandering around our neighborhoods.

41
00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:28.590
Factive killers.

42
00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:34.040
If I'm having a guy come on who is a mountain lion biologist at Topanga Canyon.

43
00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:38.420
Oh really?
Yeah,
and I might actually go and trap one with him.
How many them?

44
00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:41.820
How many do they think there are others?
There's quite a few.

45
00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:46.330
This one at one 50 wow.
Dale,
the one that died.
Wow.

46
00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:51.090
150 that was a big cat.
Jesus.
Crazy.
Three years old.

47
00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:56.030
Jesus Christ.
Three years old.
He was 150 pounds.
Just living on deer.
Yeah.

48
00:02:56.150 --> 00:03:00.250
Go look around for deer in California.
Good luck.
Yeah,

49
00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:03.130
they know deer out here.
There's so few deer have,

50
00:03:03.131 --> 00:03:06.010
you're a deer hunter in California.
Your sad face.
Oh,
you around.

51
00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:09.880
You're not looking forward to it.
And yet I see a lot of deer in Topanga.
Yeah.

52
00:03:09.881 --> 00:03:14.590
You See al few,
they're drawn to me.
Oh,
I feed them.
Are you,
um,

53
00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:17.020
it's my alpha energy.
They feel safe with me,

54
00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:20.440
but is do you have a connection with them,
do you think?
To be honest with you,

55
00:03:20.441 --> 00:03:22.990
I run with them.
Have you always been like this?
They flanked me.

56
00:03:22.991 --> 00:03:26.170
They would never go past me.
They flank pain.
When I do my Kung folded open field,

57
00:03:26.171 --> 00:03:30.490
they surround me and they bow and until I released them and I go,
Huh,

58
00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:32.210
<v 1>okay.</v>
