HEIDI GRANT HALVORSON: Thank
you, everybody, for coming.

00:00:02.383 --> 00:00:03.790
I am Heidi Grant Halvorson.

00:00:03.790 --> 00:00:07.220
I'm the Associate Director
of the Motivation Science

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:09.650
Center at Columbia University.

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:12.130
But I'm actually not here to
talk to you about motivation.

00:00:12.130 --> 00:00:15.940
Today, I'm here to talk about
an even more universal problem.

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:18.770
And that is the problem
of coming across the way

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:21.410
you intend to with other people.

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:23.290
I mean, probably
everyone in this room

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:27.230
knows what it feels like
to feel misunderstood.

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:30.220
You may suspect that some
of the people around you

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:31.896
don't quite get you.

00:00:31.896 --> 00:00:34.850
You are right to suspect
this, because it's

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:36.660
almost certainly the case.

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:39.400
One of the things social
psychologists have learned

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:42.760
in about four decades now
of studying how we all

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:47.090
make sense of one another
is that there's more often

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:49.790
than not a really
large gap between how

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:52.090
we think we're coming
across to other people

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:54.640
and how we actually are.

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:57.740
In fact, if you look at
studies of first-year college

00:00:57.740 --> 00:01:00.310
students, roommates
who are being paired up

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:03.740
for the first time, and you
ask one of the roommates

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:06.270
to fill out a questionnaire
about their personality traits

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:08.330
and then you ask the other
roommates to fill out

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:11.300
a questionnaire about the
first roommate's traits,

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:13.410
what you find is that
three to four months

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:15.890
into living together, the
correlation between those two

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:17.670
things is zero.

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:20.090
There is literally
no relationship

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:21.950
between how one
roommate sees themselves

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:23.610
and how the other
roommate sees them.

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:26.990
It takes almost the entire
first year of living together

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:29.950
for those two things to
even begin to sync up,

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:33.470
and then it gets
to be about 0.2.

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:36.690
It's true that the more you
know someone, the more likely

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:38.790
they are to be accurate
about you, the more likely

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:40.411
they are to perceive
you correctly.

00:01:40.411 --> 00:01:41.910
But even when you
look at people who

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:45.320
have been in relationships for
years, intimate relationships,

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:48.110
who've known every
part of one another,

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:49.900
and you look at the
correlations that they

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:52.020
have in their
perceptions, you find

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:57.090
they get to about 0.5 or
0.6-- so not 0, which is good.

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:58.440
But not 1, either.

00:01:58.440 --> 00:01:58.940
Right.

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:02.950
There's still a lot of room
for misunderstandings to occur.

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:04.520
And they happen all the time.

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:06.290
And sometimes, when
we fail to come

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:07.870
across the way we
intend to, there

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:10.160
are some pretty
serious consequences.

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:12.773
Does anybody know who this is?

00:02:12.773 --> 00:02:14.940
AUDIENCE: Is it Chip
Wilson, the Lululemon CEO?

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:16.095
HEIDI GRANT HALVORSON:
Chip Wilson, yes.

00:02:16.095 --> 00:02:18.230
Oh, bonus points-- she
gets a free book, if she

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:19.360
doesn't have one already.

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:21.360
That is Chip Wilson.

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:27.300
He was the founder and chairman
and CEO of Lululemon Athletica.

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:30.045
They make very, very,
very expensive yoga pants.

00:02:30.045 --> 00:02:30.890
[LAUGHTER]

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:33.900
And they have a very
devout following,

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:36.450
or at least they did up
until a few years ago

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:40.030
when they kind of hit a little
bit of a bump in the road.

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:42.110
They had come up with a
new line of yoga pants

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:44.770
using a new fabric,
and the customers

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:48.020
found that over time, they were
pilling in between the thighs.

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:50.060
So pilling, for those
of you who don't know,

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:51.670
is when fabric
rubs against itself

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:54.160
and makes those little balls
that are really annoying.

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:56.520
So customers complained
about the pilling

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:58.819
in their very, very
expensive yoga pants.

00:02:58.819 --> 00:03:01.110
And instead of doing what he
probably should have done,

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:04.600
which was apologize, say that
he was going to make it right,

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:06.950
say that he was going to
fix the fabric situation,

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:11.150
he went on Bloomberg TV
and said the following.

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:14.350
"Some women's bodies are just
not right for our pants,"

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:18.230
which turned out to have
been the wrong thing to say.

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:23.460
It was interpreted by many, many
of Lululemon's loyal customer

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:25.540
base as basically the
equivalent of saying,

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:28.200
if your fat thighs are ruining
your expensive yoga pants,

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:30.150
that's your problem
and not mine.

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:34.810
And so he actually is no
longer the chairman and CEO

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:39.460
of Lululemon Athletica, largely
because of this specific moment

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:42.460
that he just never was really
able to climb back from.

00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:45.330
What's interesting--
if you watch the video,

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:49.790
you'll see that he has no
idea he said anything wrong.

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:53.100
He has no idea he said anything
even vaguely offensive.

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:55.430
But do you know who knew
immediately that he had?

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:57.270
His wife.

00:03:57.270 --> 00:03:58.940
So that's Shannon Wilson.

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:02.460
She is one of the chief
designers of Lululemon.

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:05.020
And she was all smiles
in the interview,

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:07.220
literally right up until
this moment where he says,

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:09.690
some women's bodies are
not right for our pants.

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:11.780
And she looked at him
like that, and she

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:13.920
knew-- so big, big problem.

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:15.860
Again, is this what he intended?

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:19.690
I mean, did he literally intend
to insult half of his customer

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:20.190
base?

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:21.820
No, obviously not.

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:24.600
But because he came across in
a way that he didn't intend,

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:26.784
his career suffered
tremendously.

00:04:26.784 --> 00:04:27.950
I want to show you one more.

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:30.460
And I apologize in advance
for the quality of this image.

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:33.260
I have scoured the internet
and cannot find another version

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:35.540
of this, but I love
this story so much.

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:36.905
I'm going to tell you anyway.

00:04:36.905 --> 00:04:38.530
Here's another great
example of someone

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:40.560
coming across in a way
they did not intend.

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:44.590
That is former President
George W. Bush at a G8 summit.

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:48.320
The woman in yellow is
Angela Merkel of Germany.

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:49.730
Now, I haven't
been to one, but I

00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:55.190
imagine that G8 summits are kind
of tense-- very stressful, lots

00:04:55.190 --> 00:04:56.860
of issues being grappled with.

00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:59.560
And evidently, he
thought so too,

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:03.512
and thought that Angela
Merkel could use a back rub.

00:05:03.512 --> 00:05:05.470
And so I just want to
show you the play by play

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:06.620
of how this actually went.

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:07.950
If you look on the
far left, you can

00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:09.960
see he's actually sort of
doing the approach here.

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:11.430
And then if you
focus here, you can

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:13.640
see this seems to be the
moment where she realizes

00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:17.266
she's being rubbed and is
beginning to sort of grimace,

00:05:17.266 --> 00:05:19.640
and then here is the moment
where she actually physically

00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:23.180
shakes him off of her,
because apparently,

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:25.710
don't touch Angela Merkel is
something some people need

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:27.590
to be told explicitly.

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:29.120
Most of us just
would intuit that.

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:32.400
So here he is, and he
runs away afterward.

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:36.042
The German press went crazy.

00:05:36.042 --> 00:05:37.750
They thought it was
incredibly offensive.

00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:40.890
They thought it was patronizing,
and they thought it was sexist.

00:05:40.890 --> 00:05:45.020
There is no video of him
attempting to give Vladimir

00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:46.180
Putin a back rub, right?

00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:49.040
It's the only woman in the
room that gets the rub.

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:52.070
Again, though, not my
favorite president admittedly,

00:05:52.070 --> 00:05:54.470
but I feel a little
bad when I see this,

00:05:54.470 --> 00:05:56.450
because I think in
fairness, the guy

00:05:56.450 --> 00:05:58.330
was probably just trying
to be nice, right?

00:05:58.330 --> 00:05:59.940
He was trying to
do something nice.

00:05:59.940 --> 00:06:02.030
It was wildly
inappropriate, but he was

00:06:02.030 --> 00:06:03.820
trying to do something nice.

00:06:03.820 --> 00:06:06.460
And the question is, why
don't people get that?

00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:10.390
Why don't they get that he
didn't really mean any harm?

00:06:10.390 --> 00:06:14.210
In general, the reason
why people don't get us

00:06:14.210 --> 00:06:19.290
as much as we think they should
and as much as we think they do

00:06:19.290 --> 00:06:21.360
is that each of us is
much harder to understand

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:22.890
than we actually realize.

00:06:22.890 --> 00:06:26.800
There is something called
the illusion of transparency

00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:28.340
that we all sort
of buy into, which

00:06:28.340 --> 00:06:31.640
is that we think we're all open
books to a much larger extent

00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:32.760
than we actually are.

00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:35.360
We assume that our thoughts
and beliefs and intentions

00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:38.047
are obvious, when that could
not be further from the truth.

00:06:38.047 --> 00:06:40.130
And just to kind of give
you a sense of why that's

00:06:40.130 --> 00:06:43.130
the case, let's look at
the information you have

00:06:43.130 --> 00:06:45.640
to try to understand yourself
versus the information

00:06:45.640 --> 00:06:48.220
other people have to
try to understand you.

00:06:48.220 --> 00:06:48.930
OK?

00:06:48.930 --> 00:06:52.490
So let's see, your intentions--
yes, you know what they are.

00:06:52.490 --> 00:06:54.770
No, other people do not.

00:06:54.770 --> 00:06:56.990
You could tell
them, but we don't.

00:06:56.990 --> 00:06:58.460
Generally speaking,
we do not tell

00:06:58.460 --> 00:06:59.751
people what our intentions are.

00:06:59.751 --> 00:07:01.520
We just assume that they know.

00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:02.670
Thoughts-- same thing.

00:07:02.670 --> 00:07:03.919
You know what you're thinking.

00:07:03.919 --> 00:07:04.977
Other people don't.

00:07:04.977 --> 00:07:07.060
Your feelings-- yes, you
know what you're feeling.

00:07:07.060 --> 00:07:07.900
Other people don't.

00:07:07.900 --> 00:07:11.520
But, you say, what about
your facial expressions?

00:07:11.520 --> 00:07:15.150
Can't I tell what you're
feeling just by looking at you?

00:07:15.150 --> 00:07:15.695
Not exactly.

00:07:15.695 --> 00:07:17.320
And that's because
there's a little bit

00:07:17.320 --> 00:07:18.444
of a problem with that one.

00:07:18.444 --> 00:07:21.290
Yes, other people are
looking at your face

00:07:21.290 --> 00:07:23.214
to try to figure out
what you're feeling.

00:07:23.214 --> 00:07:25.380
But you don't know what
you're doing with your face,

00:07:25.380 --> 00:07:27.920
and sometimes there are
very big disconnects there.

00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:33.080
My editor at Harvard
Business Review

00:07:33.080 --> 00:07:35.100
a few years ago
had joined there,

00:07:35.100 --> 00:07:38.410
and kind of came in to manage
an already functioning team.

00:07:38.410 --> 00:07:40.170
And it was really
important to him

00:07:40.170 --> 00:07:42.910
that everyone there
know immediately that he

00:07:42.910 --> 00:07:45.180
valued their opinion,
he was really interested

00:07:45.180 --> 00:07:45.820
in their input.

00:07:45.820 --> 00:07:48.240
So he said-- he
immediately made an effort

00:07:48.240 --> 00:07:51.020
in those first
meetings with his team

00:07:51.020 --> 00:07:53.470
to wear his active
listening face.

00:07:53.470 --> 00:07:55.160
And it took about
six weeks for someone

00:07:55.160 --> 00:07:57.260
on the team to say,
Tim, why are you

00:07:57.260 --> 00:07:59.670
always so angry in meetings?

00:07:59.670 --> 00:08:02.410
And he said, no no, that's
my active listening face.

00:08:02.410 --> 00:08:04.560
And it turns out, his
active listening face

00:08:04.560 --> 00:08:07.530
was just really furious looking.

00:08:07.530 --> 00:08:09.950
So often, we don't know what
we're doing with our faces

00:08:09.950 --> 00:08:12.560
and we're sending the
wrong signals with them.

00:08:12.560 --> 00:08:14.080
Same thing with
body language-- yes,

00:08:14.080 --> 00:08:16.520
absolutely, other people
are using your body language

00:08:16.520 --> 00:08:19.620
to figure things out about
you, largely unconsciously.

00:08:19.620 --> 00:08:21.240
But most of us
actually have no idea

00:08:21.240 --> 00:08:23.810
what we're doing with our
bodies most of the time.

00:08:23.810 --> 00:08:26.880
You can cultivate
awareness of your body,

00:08:26.880 --> 00:08:31.054
but there's this great-- in
Sir Ken Robinson's Ted Talk,

00:08:31.054 --> 00:08:33.179
the one that's, I think,
still the most popular one

00:08:33.179 --> 00:08:34.789
of all time, he
has this great joke

00:08:34.789 --> 00:08:38.730
about how academics treat their
bodies as if they exist only

00:08:38.730 --> 00:08:40.419
to take their heads to meetings.

00:08:40.419 --> 00:08:41.850
And I love that
joke, but I think

00:08:41.850 --> 00:08:44.290
it's actually true of
everybody, not just academics.

00:08:44.290 --> 00:08:47.090
Most of us are not paying
attention to our bodies

00:08:47.090 --> 00:08:48.250
most of the time.

00:08:48.250 --> 00:08:49.200
But other people are.

00:08:49.200 --> 00:08:51.980
And again, how you're sitting,
how you hold yourself,

00:08:51.980 --> 00:08:54.960
can really send a lot of
signals you don't mean to send.

00:08:54.960 --> 00:08:57.262
OK, so what about these
last two, your behavior

00:08:57.262 --> 00:08:57.970
and what you say?

00:08:57.970 --> 00:09:01.050
I mean, this one, you'd
feel like, OK, yes, I

00:09:01.050 --> 00:09:02.960
know what I do and say,
and other people also

00:09:02.960 --> 00:09:04.440
know what I do and say, right?

00:09:04.440 --> 00:09:07.270
So they should be able to
use that to understand me.

00:09:07.270 --> 00:09:11.050
But there's an asterisk there
for a couple of reasons.

00:09:11.050 --> 00:09:14.830
One is that other people are
really not paying attention

00:09:14.830 --> 00:09:16.310
to everything you do and say.

00:09:16.310 --> 00:09:18.550
And in fairness, you're
not also paying attention

00:09:18.550 --> 00:09:20.000
to what they do and say, right?

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:23.400
We often feel like everybody's
eyes are on us in ways

00:09:23.400 --> 00:09:25.440
that they are not.

00:09:25.440 --> 00:09:26.690
People have other stuff to do.

00:09:26.690 --> 00:09:29.450
They're not necessarily hanging
on your every word or noticing

00:09:29.450 --> 00:09:31.540
everything you do,
and because of that,

00:09:31.540 --> 00:09:34.630
not everything you do
and say actually gets in

00:09:34.630 --> 00:09:38.130
and is used then to process
their perception of you.

00:09:38.130 --> 00:09:40.550
But there's an even
bigger problem, actually.

00:09:40.550 --> 00:09:42.350
You know this expression, right?

00:09:42.350 --> 00:09:45.320
Beauty is in the eye of the
beholder, or the perceiver.

00:09:45.320 --> 00:09:46.590
It's perfectly true.

00:09:46.590 --> 00:09:48.630
So is everything else.

00:09:48.630 --> 00:09:52.340
So literally, everything
is a matter of perception--

00:09:52.340 --> 00:09:53.750
not just beauty.

00:09:53.750 --> 00:09:56.510
We tend to assume that is
sort of the relationship

00:09:56.510 --> 00:10:00.210
between our words and
actions and how people see us

00:10:00.210 --> 00:10:01.580
as a sort of one to one thing.

00:10:01.580 --> 00:10:03.790
I do x, and therefore
they think x.

00:10:03.790 --> 00:10:05.910
But that's not how it works.

00:10:05.910 --> 00:10:09.010
I do x, and then that
x gets interpreted,

00:10:09.010 --> 00:10:11.270
and then that's how they see me.

00:10:11.270 --> 00:10:13.900
And everything we do is
open to interpretation, even

00:10:13.900 --> 00:10:15.400
really simple stuff--
that you would

00:10:15.400 --> 00:10:18.460
think if I said,
hey, how you doing,

00:10:18.460 --> 00:10:20.100
that's unambiguous, right?

00:10:20.100 --> 00:10:20.960
But is it, really?

00:10:20.960 --> 00:10:23.960
What if I said, [MONOTONE VOICE]
hey, how you doing?

00:10:23.960 --> 00:10:25.910
If there's a tone
there now suddenly,

00:10:25.910 --> 00:10:26.910
are you annoyed with me?

00:10:26.910 --> 00:10:28.360
What is that about?

00:10:28.360 --> 00:10:29.920
So everything, right?

00:10:29.920 --> 00:10:32.840
It's possible to sort of
read different things into.

00:10:32.840 --> 00:10:34.420
So if we want to
try to figure out

00:10:34.420 --> 00:10:37.000
how to come across
the way we intend,

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:39.959
we need to know what's happening
in the interpretation box.

00:10:39.959 --> 00:10:42.250
And the answer is there's a
whole bunch of stuff that's

00:10:42.250 --> 00:10:43.530
happening in the
interpretation box.

00:10:43.530 --> 00:10:44.446
So what goes in there?

00:10:44.446 --> 00:10:47.100
What goes in is
what you do and say.

00:10:47.100 --> 00:10:50.510
And then things like
stereotypes and assumptions

00:10:50.510 --> 00:10:53.620
that people make, almost
entirely unconsciously.

00:10:53.620 --> 00:10:58.730
One of the scariest-- I mean,
most fascinating and most

00:10:58.730 --> 00:11:02.660
terrifying-- findings in social
psychology in the last 30 years

00:11:02.660 --> 00:11:05.070
is the realization
that you don't

00:11:05.070 --> 00:11:09.410
need to believe a stereotype
in order to have it affect you.

00:11:09.410 --> 00:11:12.120
You just need to know it.

00:11:12.120 --> 00:11:13.870
And if you belong to
a particular culture,

00:11:13.870 --> 00:11:16.050
you know all the stereotypes.

00:11:16.050 --> 00:11:18.010
And stereotypes tend
to get activated

00:11:18.010 --> 00:11:21.060
upon meeting a member
of a stereotyped group.

00:11:21.060 --> 00:11:23.950
So that gets activated in
the brain of your perceiver.

00:11:23.950 --> 00:11:24.560
It's in there.

00:11:24.560 --> 00:11:26.290
It's in there with a whole
bunch of other stuff.

00:11:26.290 --> 00:11:28.690
But there's always a chance
that stereotypes can influence

00:11:28.690 --> 00:11:30.700
how people see you, even
when they don't believe

00:11:30.700 --> 00:11:32.452
those stereotypes are true.

00:11:32.452 --> 00:11:34.660
There are also a whole host
of assumptions most of us

00:11:34.660 --> 00:11:36.160
run around having
no idea we're even

00:11:36.160 --> 00:11:39.620
making about the other people
when we're perceiving them.

00:11:39.620 --> 00:11:42.519
I'll give you one example,
because it's kind of hilarious,

00:11:42.519 --> 00:11:43.560
that I particularly love.

00:11:43.560 --> 00:11:46.130
It's an assumption that we
all make about one another.

00:11:46.130 --> 00:11:49.079
It's called the false
uniqueness effect.

00:11:49.079 --> 00:11:50.370
So there's really two of these.

00:11:50.370 --> 00:11:52.080
There's false consensus,
which you may have heard of,

00:11:52.080 --> 00:11:53.260
and false uniqueness.

00:11:53.260 --> 00:11:56.950
False consensus is when we tend
to assume that other people

00:11:56.950 --> 00:11:58.610
share our opinions.

00:11:58.610 --> 00:12:00.590
So people who like
chocolate ice cream best,

00:12:00.590 --> 00:12:02.670
if you ask them how many other
people like chocolate ice

00:12:02.670 --> 00:12:05.200
cream best, they assume way more
people like chocolate ice cream

00:12:05.200 --> 00:12:06.116
than they actually do.

00:12:06.116 --> 00:12:09.210
We all tend to think our
opinions are right, OK?

00:12:09.210 --> 00:12:10.360
So that's false consensus.

00:12:10.360 --> 00:12:12.700
False uniqueness,
however, is that we all

00:12:12.700 --> 00:12:15.160
tend to think we're better
people than everyone else,

00:12:15.160 --> 00:12:18.950
that our good qualities are more
unique than they actually are.

00:12:18.950 --> 00:12:21.404
And my favorite
version of this of time

00:12:21.404 --> 00:12:23.320
comes from a study that
was done in the 1980s.

00:12:23.320 --> 00:12:25.940
It was actually a phone
survey of Americans.

00:12:25.940 --> 00:12:29.150
And they asked
people two questions.

00:12:29.150 --> 00:12:32.417
For each of the Ten
Commandments, do you obey it?

00:12:32.417 --> 00:12:34.250
And then, what percentage
of other Americans

00:12:34.250 --> 00:12:37.530
do you think obey this
commandment as well?

00:12:37.530 --> 00:12:39.810
So here's what they found.

00:12:39.810 --> 00:12:44.020
I want to just
highlight one thing.

00:12:44.020 --> 00:12:45.818
I don't know about
you-- I thought

00:12:45.818 --> 00:12:46.984
that number would be higher.

00:12:46.984 --> 00:12:49.770
[LAUGHTER]

00:12:49.770 --> 00:12:51.820
It's a phone survey, right?

00:12:51.820 --> 00:12:53.520
People are like,
yeah, no, sorry.

00:12:53.520 --> 00:12:56.220
I break that one all
the time, on the phone.

00:12:56.220 --> 00:12:57.074
Which is fine.

00:12:57.074 --> 00:12:58.490
But you can see
in general, people

00:12:58.490 --> 00:13:02.050
are claiming at least that
they follow, for the most part,

00:13:02.050 --> 00:13:03.920
most of the Ten Commandments.

00:13:03.920 --> 00:13:05.930
But here's the percentage
of other Americans

00:13:05.930 --> 00:13:07.400
they think are doing it.

00:13:07.400 --> 00:13:09.450
So then you see the giant drop.

00:13:09.450 --> 00:13:14.802
So apparently, most people
think that only 71% of us

00:13:14.802 --> 00:13:15.760
are not killing people.

00:13:15.760 --> 00:13:17.870
It's amazing anyone
actually leaves their house

00:13:17.870 --> 00:13:19.690
if they're under
that impression.

00:13:19.690 --> 00:13:22.630
Yeah, not killing people is
not that special apparently.

00:13:22.630 --> 00:13:24.690
So anyway, this is
the kind of thing

00:13:24.690 --> 00:13:27.429
that does seep into, once
again, our perceptions of one

00:13:27.429 --> 00:13:29.470
another-- that there's a
tendency for us to think

00:13:29.470 --> 00:13:32.990
that other people probably are
not as morally and ethically

00:13:32.990 --> 00:13:37.670
good, or as capable
or as smart as we are.

00:13:37.670 --> 00:13:39.439
What else goes into the box?

00:13:39.439 --> 00:13:41.230
Past experience with
you goes into the box.

00:13:41.230 --> 00:13:42.690
And that's a good thing, right?

00:13:42.690 --> 00:13:46.180
You want people to use their
past experience with you

00:13:46.180 --> 00:13:48.160
to try to understand
your behavior today.

00:13:48.160 --> 00:13:51.300
So if you make a joke and it's
in a little bit bad taste,

00:13:51.300 --> 00:13:54.190
but I know you and I know
that you're a funny person

00:13:54.190 --> 00:13:56.440
and you're generally
kind-hearted,

00:13:56.440 --> 00:13:59.220
then I'm more likely to
interpret that in a benign way

00:13:59.220 --> 00:14:00.616
and not get offended by it.

00:14:00.616 --> 00:14:02.990
And that's the kind of thing
we want people to do, right?

00:14:02.990 --> 00:14:04.698
We want them to use
their history with us

00:14:04.698 --> 00:14:07.760
to understand what we do
today-- unless, of course,

00:14:07.760 --> 00:14:09.630
your history with
someone is actually not

00:14:09.630 --> 00:14:12.260
representative of what
they're actually like.

00:14:12.260 --> 00:14:14.100
This is the whole
power-of-first-impressions

00:14:14.100 --> 00:14:14.600
thing.

00:14:14.600 --> 00:14:17.560
Once you make a first
impression on someone,

00:14:17.560 --> 00:14:20.800
then they're going to use
that to interpret everything

00:14:20.800 --> 00:14:22.020
you do afterward.

00:14:22.020 --> 00:14:24.180
And I'll show you one
scary example of this.

00:14:24.180 --> 00:14:26.130
This was a study
that was done where

00:14:26.130 --> 00:14:28.730
math teachers, elementary
school math teachers,

00:14:28.730 --> 00:14:32.380
were watching two children
perform a math test.

00:14:32.380 --> 00:14:35.230
And the math test
had 30 questions.

00:14:35.230 --> 00:14:37.670
And this was their
performance on the first 15.

00:14:37.670 --> 00:14:39.830
So in the first 15, Tim
gets 11 of them right

00:14:39.830 --> 00:14:41.930
and Charlotte gets four right.

00:14:41.930 --> 00:14:45.480
But then on the second half,
Tim only gets four right

00:14:45.480 --> 00:14:46.490
and Charlotte gets 11.

00:14:46.490 --> 00:14:48.239
So if you look at their
total performance,

00:14:48.239 --> 00:14:50.140
it's exactly the same.

00:14:50.140 --> 00:14:55.914
Guess which kid all the teachers
think is better at math.

00:14:55.914 --> 00:14:56.580
Go ahead, guess.

00:14:56.580 --> 00:14:57.520
AUDIENCE: Tim.

00:14:57.520 --> 00:14:58.300
HEIDI GRANT HALVORSON: It's Tim.

00:14:58.300 --> 00:14:59.560
And it's not because
Tim is a boy,

00:14:59.560 --> 00:15:01.530
because you can run these
with the same gender.

00:15:01.530 --> 00:15:03.050
It doesn't matter.

00:15:03.050 --> 00:15:05.160
It's entirely a
primacy effect, right?

00:15:05.160 --> 00:15:08.429
It's entirely that what
they learned first about Tim

00:15:08.429 --> 00:15:10.220
was that he seemed to
be very good at math.

00:15:10.220 --> 00:15:12.011
And what they learned
first about Charlotte

00:15:12.011 --> 00:15:13.970
was that she didn't
seem to be, and they

00:15:13.970 --> 00:15:15.900
didn't correct
sufficiently afterward

00:15:15.900 --> 00:15:17.830
for the changes in
their performance.

00:15:17.830 --> 00:15:21.360
So obviously, this is scary,
to think that perception works

00:15:21.360 --> 00:15:23.370
this way, that people
who are late bloomers

00:15:23.370 --> 00:15:25.620
or who maybe don't make
a good first impression,

00:15:25.620 --> 00:15:27.560
are going to have that
following them around

00:15:27.560 --> 00:15:29.540
and have everything they
do seen through that lens.

00:15:29.540 --> 00:15:30.750
I mean, I'd love to
be the person that

00:15:30.750 --> 00:15:32.250
got up here and
said, everything you

00:15:32.250 --> 00:15:34.170
hear about first
impressions being important

00:15:34.170 --> 00:15:35.513
is not such a big deal.

00:15:35.513 --> 00:15:36.200
It is.

00:15:36.200 --> 00:15:38.000
It really is.

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:42.070
It takes a lot of work to
undo a bad first impression.

00:15:42.070 --> 00:15:44.170
It's completely
doable, but it takes

00:15:44.170 --> 00:15:45.810
hundreds of times
the amount of work

00:15:45.810 --> 00:15:47.590
to undo a bad one
than it does to make

00:15:47.590 --> 00:15:48.920
a good one in the first place.

00:15:48.920 --> 00:15:50.920
And we'll talk more about
how to make a good one

00:15:50.920 --> 00:15:52.520
in the first place in a minute.

00:15:52.520 --> 00:15:53.790
So that goes in there.

00:15:53.790 --> 00:15:54.790
What else goes in there?

00:15:54.790 --> 00:15:56.110
Stuff about them, right?

00:15:56.110 --> 00:15:59.030
Their perception of you is
affected by stuff about them--

00:15:59.030 --> 00:16:02.330
their experiences, their
goals, their motivations,

00:16:02.330 --> 00:16:05.360
their beliefs, things that have
nothing to do with you at all.

00:16:05.360 --> 00:16:08.500
I saw a very scary
statistic the other day,

00:16:08.500 --> 00:16:12.500
that one study had shown
performance review ratings,

00:16:12.500 --> 00:16:15.670
that about over 60% of the
variability in performance

00:16:15.670 --> 00:16:18.830
review ratings is
attributed to the rater,

00:16:18.830 --> 00:16:22.611
not the person being rated--
not your performance,

00:16:22.611 --> 00:16:24.860
but the person who's actually
rating your performance.

00:16:24.860 --> 00:16:27.720
Over half of the variability
in that is actually

00:16:27.720 --> 00:16:29.450
the person doing the rating.

00:16:29.450 --> 00:16:30.074
OK?

00:16:30.074 --> 00:16:30.990
OK, that's depressing.

00:16:30.990 --> 00:16:33.520
Let's just move on to the
next thing, which is context.

00:16:33.520 --> 00:16:35.410
Context goes into
the box, as well.

00:16:35.410 --> 00:16:36.410
And that's a good thing.

00:16:36.410 --> 00:16:37.270
You want context.

00:16:37.270 --> 00:16:40.580
You want people to take
the situation into account.

00:16:40.580 --> 00:16:43.346
So if I'm a little bit
cranky with you one day

00:16:43.346 --> 00:16:45.220
but you know that I'm
under a lot of pressure

00:16:45.220 --> 00:16:47.100
and I haven't slept
well, I want you

00:16:47.100 --> 00:16:48.840
to take that
context into account

00:16:48.840 --> 00:16:50.530
when you interpret
my behavior, and not

00:16:50.530 --> 00:16:51.970
just think that I'm a jerk.

00:16:51.970 --> 00:16:53.180
So that's great.

00:16:53.180 --> 00:16:54.370
We want context.

00:16:54.370 --> 00:16:57.270
Context helps people to
be accurate about you.

00:16:57.270 --> 00:16:58.460
Here's the problem.

00:16:58.460 --> 00:17:02.540
Every single thing I mentioned
up until this one is automatic.

00:17:02.540 --> 00:17:04.950
So it's just an automatic
part of perception--

00:17:04.950 --> 00:17:07.160
that we use stereotypes
and assumptions,

00:17:07.160 --> 00:17:09.980
we use past experience
with you, stuff about me

00:17:09.980 --> 00:17:12.066
gets into it when I'm
trying to understand you.

00:17:12.066 --> 00:17:17.240
But context takes effort,
and it takes mental capacity.

00:17:17.240 --> 00:17:20.430
So when people are not motivated
to be accurate about you

00:17:20.430 --> 00:17:23.832
or when they're too cognitively
busy to really spend

00:17:23.832 --> 00:17:25.290
the time thinking
about it, they're

00:17:25.290 --> 00:17:27.812
not going to take
context into account.

00:17:27.812 --> 00:17:29.520
OK, so now it's really
depressing, right?

00:17:29.520 --> 00:17:33.370
Because now you're seeing all
this stuff and you think, OK,

00:17:33.370 --> 00:17:35.880
how is it possible we ever
understand each other at all,

00:17:35.880 --> 00:17:37.360
honestly, because
all of this stuff

00:17:37.360 --> 00:17:39.880
is getting in the way
of any of us being

00:17:39.880 --> 00:17:42.400
accurate about one another?

00:17:42.400 --> 00:17:45.550
And the answer is that--
well, the good news really,

00:17:45.550 --> 00:17:50.300
is that there are certain kinds
of signals that you can send

00:17:50.300 --> 00:17:52.540
that are clearer than others.

00:17:52.540 --> 00:17:55.490
You can kind of think of
this whole perception issue

00:17:55.490 --> 00:17:57.420
as trying to send a
really good signal

00:17:57.420 --> 00:17:59.620
amongst a whole lot of noise.

00:17:59.620 --> 00:18:01.610
And certain kinds of
behaviors and kinds

00:18:01.610 --> 00:18:04.980
of things you can say
reliably are interpreted

00:18:04.980 --> 00:18:07.010
in a particular
way by other people

00:18:07.010 --> 00:18:09.380
and can help you then to
make the impression you're

00:18:09.380 --> 00:18:12.060
trying to make, or to come
across the way you're intending

00:18:12.060 --> 00:18:14.470
to with people, whether
your work colleagues

00:18:14.470 --> 00:18:16.100
or in your personal life.

00:18:16.100 --> 00:18:19.980
And so I want to take the time
that I have left to give you

00:18:19.980 --> 00:18:21.730
what some of those signals are.

00:18:21.730 --> 00:18:24.430
These are actually useful things
that, if you do more of them,

00:18:24.430 --> 00:18:26.010
you'll come across
more the way you

00:18:26.010 --> 00:18:27.867
intend to in more situations.

00:18:27.867 --> 00:18:29.700
First, we're going to
talk about the signals

00:18:29.700 --> 00:18:32.374
that you need to send in order
to be trusted by other people.

00:18:32.374 --> 00:18:34.040
This is particularly
important if you're

00:18:34.040 --> 00:18:35.081
in a leadership position.

00:18:35.081 --> 00:18:37.750
But honestly, it's important
in all relationships

00:18:37.750 --> 00:18:38.880
to be trusted.

00:18:38.880 --> 00:18:41.460
And then, the signals you need
to send to be likable-- now,

00:18:41.460 --> 00:18:45.310
that last one has obviously
got a lot of components to it.

00:18:45.310 --> 00:18:47.310
But there are certain
issues that really come up

00:18:47.310 --> 00:18:51.270
a lot when it comes to how to be
likeable with your colleagues.

00:18:51.270 --> 00:18:52.770
So I want to talk
about some signals

00:18:52.770 --> 00:18:57.020
to send to make sure that
your colleagues like you as

00:18:57.020 --> 00:18:58.700
much as you would like them to.

00:18:58.700 --> 00:19:01.045
OK, so let's start with trust.

00:19:03.840 --> 00:19:06.610
Fun fact-- so our
brains are basically

00:19:06.610 --> 00:19:09.210
hunter-gatherer brains.

00:19:09.210 --> 00:19:12.260
10,000 years ago,
life for humans

00:19:12.260 --> 00:19:13.710
looked very, very different.

00:19:13.710 --> 00:19:15.940
But our brains have
not changed at all.

00:19:15.940 --> 00:19:18.620
So we have the same wiring.

00:19:18.620 --> 00:19:21.160
And that wiring
made a lot of sense

00:19:21.160 --> 00:19:22.750
when we were
hunter-gatherers, and it

00:19:22.750 --> 00:19:25.450
complicates things a little
bit now in our modern world

00:19:25.450 --> 00:19:26.170
sometimes.

00:19:26.170 --> 00:19:27.780
But one of the
things you have to do

00:19:27.780 --> 00:19:29.340
when you are a
hunter-gatherer-- actually,

00:19:29.340 --> 00:19:31.673
the thing you have to do when
you're a hunger-gatherer--

00:19:31.673 --> 00:19:32.420
was stay alive.

00:19:32.420 --> 00:19:36.020
It was sort of job one, all
day every day, to not die.

00:19:36.020 --> 00:19:39.210
And in order to not die, you
need to very, very quickly

00:19:39.210 --> 00:19:43.652
be able to assess whether or not
another human or creature was

00:19:43.652 --> 00:19:45.110
a friend or a foe,
was somebody who

00:19:45.110 --> 00:19:46.320
was going to help
you and support you

00:19:46.320 --> 00:19:48.250
or somebody who was going
to hit you with a big stick.

00:19:48.250 --> 00:19:50.010
And you needed to know
that pretty much as

00:19:50.010 --> 00:19:51.290
fast as possible.

00:19:51.290 --> 00:19:53.620
So our brains are wired
to ask this question.

00:19:53.620 --> 00:19:56.120
We ask it whenever
we meet someone new,

00:19:56.120 --> 00:19:59.400
but we actually continue to ask
it throughout our relationships

00:19:59.400 --> 00:20:02.060
with people-- again, on a
largely unconscious level,

00:20:02.060 --> 00:20:03.630
we're processing this question.

00:20:03.630 --> 00:20:04.350
Can I trust you?

00:20:04.350 --> 00:20:05.880
Are you my friend or foe?

00:20:05.880 --> 00:20:08.670
And it turns out that the
way we calculate the answer

00:20:08.670 --> 00:20:11.430
to that question basically
has to do with your ability

00:20:11.430 --> 00:20:12.907
to project two qualities.

00:20:12.907 --> 00:20:15.490
These are the two qualities that
make you trustworthy-seeming.

00:20:18.124 --> 00:20:20.040
I mean, it's great to
be actually trustworthy,

00:20:20.040 --> 00:20:21.384
and you should do that, too.

00:20:21.384 --> 00:20:22.800
But if you're
actually trustworthy

00:20:22.800 --> 00:20:24.430
and you don't projects
trustworthiness,

00:20:24.430 --> 00:20:25.560
it just doesn't help you.

00:20:25.560 --> 00:20:27.860
So here's how you
project trustworthiness,

00:20:27.860 --> 00:20:31.070
through projecting both
warmth and competence.

00:20:31.070 --> 00:20:35.770
Warmth sends the message
to the other person

00:20:35.770 --> 00:20:37.900
that you're on their side.

00:20:37.900 --> 00:20:40.090
You have good
intentions toward them.

00:20:40.090 --> 00:20:42.240
Competent signals
send the message

00:20:42.240 --> 00:20:45.460
that you can act on those
intentions if you choose to.

00:20:45.460 --> 00:20:49.720
So warm and competent people
are very powerful allies,

00:20:49.720 --> 00:20:53.750
and cold and competent people
are very potent enemies.

00:20:53.750 --> 00:20:55.500
And you can illustrate
this really nicely,

00:20:55.500 --> 00:20:58.640
as you can I think literally
every concept in psychology,

00:20:58.640 --> 00:20:59.880
with "The Simpsons."

00:20:59.880 --> 00:21:02.020
So if you're wandering
around Springfield

00:21:02.020 --> 00:21:03.910
and you need some
help, who do you go to?

00:21:03.910 --> 00:21:05.730
You go to Lisa Simpson.

00:21:05.730 --> 00:21:07.570
She's warm and competent, right?

00:21:07.570 --> 00:21:09.270
She's wicked smart,
but she's also

00:21:09.270 --> 00:21:11.950
somebody who you know would have
good intentions towards you,

00:21:11.950 --> 00:21:13.799
and she's all kinds
of nice and pleasant.

00:21:13.799 --> 00:21:15.340
So that's the person
you would go to.

00:21:15.340 --> 00:21:17.770
Unfortunately,
here's the problem.

00:21:17.770 --> 00:21:20.750
People are very good-- I'm
sure everybody in this room

00:21:20.750 --> 00:21:24.780
is actually very good at sending
signals of competence, right?

00:21:24.780 --> 00:21:28.950
We know intuitively how to
do that, and we learn it,

00:21:28.950 --> 00:21:29.870
and we're aware of it.

00:21:29.870 --> 00:21:32.890
We're aware that we need
to appear competent.

00:21:32.890 --> 00:21:36.250
Most people are not aware
that they need to appear warm,

00:21:36.250 --> 00:21:38.920
and they're very bad
at intuiting what they

00:21:38.920 --> 00:21:40.680
need to do in order to do that.

00:21:40.680 --> 00:21:43.270
If you fail to send
warmth signals,

00:21:43.270 --> 00:21:45.710
then there is no happy
medium ground here.

00:21:45.710 --> 00:21:47.520
If you fail to send
warmth signals,

00:21:47.520 --> 00:21:49.040
you will come across as cold.

00:21:49.040 --> 00:21:50.205
And then you're Mr. Burns.

00:21:50.205 --> 00:21:52.065
[LAUGHTER]

00:21:52.065 --> 00:21:53.120
And that's it.

00:21:53.120 --> 00:21:55.270
You're either Lisa or
you're Mr. Burns, right?

00:21:55.270 --> 00:21:57.990
You're very competent, but
definitely not on your side.

00:21:57.990 --> 00:22:00.750
And this is a mistake actually
leaders make in particular,

00:22:00.750 --> 00:22:04.410
where they are so focused
on being competent that they

00:22:04.410 --> 00:22:08.410
forget to be warm, and so they
end up coming across as cold.

00:22:08.410 --> 00:22:11.980
And then, cold and competent
is a particularly toxic brew

00:22:11.980 --> 00:22:13.000
for trust.

00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:14.505
By the way, just
to round it out--

00:22:14.505 --> 00:22:16.880
I don't think anybody here
needs to worry about appearing

00:22:16.880 --> 00:22:19.450
incompetent, but just in
case you're wondering,

00:22:19.450 --> 00:22:21.690
incompetent and
warm would be Homer.

00:22:21.690 --> 00:22:23.940
Towards people who are
incompetent but warm,

00:22:23.940 --> 00:22:27.270
we tend to have pity and
compassion reactions.

00:22:27.270 --> 00:22:29.940
And then if you're incompetent
and cold, you're Moe.

00:22:29.940 --> 00:22:31.581
We tend to have
disgust reactions

00:22:31.581 --> 00:22:32.580
toward people like that.

00:22:32.580 --> 00:22:34.140
We don't really want to have
anything to do with them.

00:22:34.140 --> 00:22:36.691
But for your purposes, what
you need to think about

00:22:36.691 --> 00:22:38.940
is, do I want to be Lisa or
do I want to be Mr. Burns,

00:22:38.940 --> 00:22:42.340
and how can I make sure that
I'm sending Lisa signals?

00:22:42.340 --> 00:22:43.430
So here's how you do it.

00:22:43.430 --> 00:22:45.340
It's not rocket
science, and it really

00:22:45.340 --> 00:22:48.302
does just involve, again,
cultivating awareness

00:22:48.302 --> 00:22:50.010
of what you're doing
and being deliberate

00:22:50.010 --> 00:22:51.570
about the signals that you send.

00:22:51.570 --> 00:22:54.400
So the first one is
maintain eye contact.

00:22:54.400 --> 00:22:56.970
When we talk about
projecting competence,

00:22:56.970 --> 00:22:58.900
we talk all the time
about the importance

00:22:58.900 --> 00:23:01.179
of looking at people when
you're talking to them.

00:23:01.179 --> 00:23:03.220
But that's actually not
the one I want you to do,

00:23:03.220 --> 00:23:04.600
although you should
do that, too.

00:23:04.600 --> 00:23:06.600
What I'm talking about
here is looking at people

00:23:06.600 --> 00:23:08.590
when they're talking to you.

00:23:08.590 --> 00:23:10.920
That's how you send
a warmth signal.

00:23:10.920 --> 00:23:13.740
And more and more,
we're not doing it.

00:23:13.740 --> 00:23:16.560
I love my smartwatch and my
smartphone and everything

00:23:16.560 --> 00:23:18.580
just as much as anybody
else in this room.

00:23:18.580 --> 00:23:20.930
But the presence of
these things in our lives

00:23:20.930 --> 00:23:22.860
means that more and
more, we are not

00:23:22.860 --> 00:23:25.120
looking at people when
they are talking to us.

00:23:25.120 --> 00:23:26.780
And if I had a nickel
for every meeting

00:23:26.780 --> 00:23:29.072
that I went to where eyes
are literally everywhere--

00:23:29.072 --> 00:23:30.280
and you're looking at me now.

00:23:30.280 --> 00:23:31.070
I feel really good.

00:23:31.070 --> 00:23:31.986
You're all my friends.

00:23:31.986 --> 00:23:34.820
But in regular meetings,
our eyes are everywhere.

00:23:34.820 --> 00:23:35.950
And you might be listening.

00:23:35.950 --> 00:23:37.140
You might totally be listening.

00:23:37.140 --> 00:23:38.900
But you don't look
like you're listening.

00:23:38.900 --> 00:23:42.050
And that sends a very strong
coldness signal to the speaker.

00:23:42.050 --> 00:23:43.510
It looks like
you're uninterested.

00:23:43.510 --> 00:23:44.880
It looks like you don't care.

00:23:44.880 --> 00:23:46.255
It looks like
you're checked out.

00:23:46.255 --> 00:23:49.030
So a very simple but very
powerful thing you can do

00:23:49.030 --> 00:23:51.940
is actually track the person
who's speaking in the room,

00:23:51.940 --> 00:23:54.550
and make sure they see you--
it's not enough to listen.

00:23:54.550 --> 00:23:56.710
You have to look like
you're listening.

00:23:56.710 --> 00:23:59.970
The next one is smile and
nod-- not like a crazy person,

00:23:59.970 --> 00:24:03.970
but just a little bit more
maybe than you might normally.

00:24:03.970 --> 00:24:05.650
Smiling is really
great, especially

00:24:05.650 --> 00:24:07.300
if someone smiles at you.

00:24:07.300 --> 00:24:09.659
Oh please, don't ever
let someone smile at you

00:24:09.659 --> 00:24:10.700
and you don't smile back.

00:24:10.700 --> 00:24:12.440
That's a super cold sign.

00:24:12.440 --> 00:24:15.080
And then, nodding at the end of
sentences is really important.

00:24:15.080 --> 00:24:16.581
This is one of
these things where,

00:24:16.581 --> 00:24:19.205
if you're ever in a conversation
with someone who doesn't do it

00:24:19.205 --> 00:24:21.300
and you feel super
uncomfortable and often you

00:24:21.300 --> 00:24:23.591
can't put your finger on why,
but if somebody just sort

00:24:23.591 --> 00:24:25.370
of stares back at you
while you're talking

00:24:25.370 --> 00:24:28.330
and you can't really-- are
they following what I'm saying?

00:24:28.330 --> 00:24:29.070
Do they know?

00:24:29.070 --> 00:24:30.910
It's really disturbing.

00:24:30.910 --> 00:24:33.600
So a little head nod
as someone's talking

00:24:33.600 --> 00:24:34.537
is really important.

00:24:34.537 --> 00:24:36.870
It lets them know-- it's like
a little mini affirmation,

00:24:36.870 --> 00:24:38.995
like yes, I agree with you,
and I'm understanding--

00:24:38.995 --> 00:24:41.330
super important.

00:24:41.330 --> 00:24:44.450
Show empathy-- again, not like,
let's take out a box of Kleenex

00:24:44.450 --> 00:24:46.407
and cry about
things, but just sort

00:24:46.407 --> 00:24:48.990
of saying-- when something bad
happens to someone, saying "I'm

00:24:48.990 --> 00:24:50.910
sorry that happened"
is what psychologists

00:24:50.910 --> 00:24:53.040
call a superfluous apology.

00:24:53.040 --> 00:24:55.294
It literally is, I
didn't do the bad thing,

00:24:55.294 --> 00:24:56.960
but I'm sorry it
happened to you-- like,

00:24:56.960 --> 00:24:58.620
oh, I'm sorry it rained on
you on your way to work,

00:24:58.620 --> 00:25:01.036
or I'm sorry you have to deal
with this frustrating client

00:25:01.036 --> 00:25:03.514
or whatever-- those
kinds of simple signs

00:25:03.514 --> 00:25:05.180
that you're paying
attention to the fact

00:25:05.180 --> 00:25:06.550
that someone's having
a difficult time,

00:25:06.550 --> 00:25:08.530
and you're expressing
something about it--

00:25:08.530 --> 00:25:13.250
very powerful way to express
empathy and to show warmth.

00:25:13.250 --> 00:25:17.780
Trust them first-- human
beings are absurdly reciprocal.

00:25:17.780 --> 00:25:20.680
I mean, we just give
back what we get.

00:25:20.680 --> 00:25:23.640
And there is something very
powerful about trusting

00:25:23.640 --> 00:25:25.940
people that makes them want
to trust you in return.

00:25:25.940 --> 00:25:29.180
It's one of the reasons why
micromanaging is so toxic.

00:25:29.180 --> 00:25:31.800
I mean, being micromanaged
is irritating.

00:25:31.800 --> 00:25:33.510
But one of the other
things that it does

00:25:33.510 --> 00:25:36.270
is it tends to undermine your
trust in the person who's

00:25:36.270 --> 00:25:39.160
micromanaging you, because
they don't trust you obviously,

00:25:39.160 --> 00:25:40.740
so why should you trust them?

00:25:40.740 --> 00:25:42.990
So again, it's something
very important to think about

00:25:42.990 --> 00:25:44.860
from a leadership position.

00:25:44.860 --> 00:25:46.580
When you're in one,
trusting other people

00:25:46.580 --> 00:25:49.070
or trusting the other people
on your team, your colleagues,

00:25:49.070 --> 00:25:51.610
can make them want to
trust you in return.

00:25:51.610 --> 00:25:56.090
And finally, be affirming-- I
know it's sort of a gross word,

00:25:56.090 --> 00:25:59.301
but it is actually really
important-- not to make stuff

00:25:59.301 --> 00:25:59.800
up.

00:25:59.800 --> 00:26:02.630
I wouldn't ever suggest you say
anything that you don't mean.

00:26:02.630 --> 00:26:05.950
But very, very often,
we think positive things

00:26:05.950 --> 00:26:08.760
about the people in our lives,
about the people we work with,

00:26:08.760 --> 00:26:10.580
and we just don't say them.

00:26:10.580 --> 00:26:14.870
And there's this expression,
"it goes without saying."

00:26:14.870 --> 00:26:16.080
That's a terrible expression.

00:26:16.080 --> 00:26:17.250
It goes with saying.

00:26:17.250 --> 00:26:18.760
All of this stuff
goes with saying.

00:26:18.760 --> 00:26:21.090
If you don't say it, they
don't know you think it.

00:26:21.090 --> 00:26:23.700
And so one thing I
think each of us can do,

00:26:23.700 --> 00:26:26.320
really, is think about little
ways in which we can express

00:26:26.320 --> 00:26:28.340
more the positive
things we're already

00:26:28.340 --> 00:26:31.070
thinking about the people
we work with all the time.

00:26:31.070 --> 00:26:33.450
It's a great way,
again, to show warmth

00:26:33.450 --> 00:26:34.870
and to create that trust.

00:26:34.870 --> 00:26:37.840
So all simple stuff,
but the trick here

00:26:37.840 --> 00:26:40.690
is actually doing it,
and actually making

00:26:40.690 --> 00:26:42.670
a point of doing it--
because much of the time,

00:26:42.670 --> 00:26:45.490
we don't give as much thought to
this as we do to whether or not

00:26:45.490 --> 00:26:49.301
I look smart and
capable and competent.

00:26:49.301 --> 00:26:51.300
Two things I want to
mention, because this often

00:26:51.300 --> 00:26:56.540
kind of comes up-- you do not
look less smart if you're warm.

00:26:56.540 --> 00:27:01.250
This is one of these things like
people believing that there are

00:27:01.250 --> 00:27:05.150
math people, as if some people
are just born good at math

00:27:05.150 --> 00:27:07.750
and some people don't have the
genes to be able to do that.

00:27:07.750 --> 00:27:10.840
And what are these
beliefs that undermine

00:27:10.840 --> 00:27:12.210
a lot of people's behavior?

00:27:12.210 --> 00:27:14.690
And this is another one--
people do implicitly

00:27:14.690 --> 00:27:18.050
assume that the warmer they
are, the dumber they look,

00:27:18.050 --> 00:27:20.280
and the colder they are,
the smarter they look.

00:27:20.280 --> 00:27:22.250
In fact, there are
studies that show this.

00:27:22.250 --> 00:27:25.360
If you bring people into a lab
and you say, write a letter.

00:27:25.360 --> 00:27:27.370
And in the letter, I want
you to impress someone

00:27:27.370 --> 00:27:28.940
with how intelligent
you are, they

00:27:28.940 --> 00:27:31.390
bring out all of
their 25 cent words.

00:27:31.390 --> 00:27:33.417
And if you say, I want
you to write a letter

00:27:33.417 --> 00:27:35.500
and I want you to make the
person really like you,

00:27:35.500 --> 00:27:37.810
they literally don't
use any words that

00:27:37.810 --> 00:27:39.510
have more than six letters.

00:27:39.510 --> 00:27:41.170
It's just insane.

00:27:41.170 --> 00:27:43.470
We dumb down when
we want to be liked,

00:27:43.470 --> 00:27:45.900
and we get cold when
we want to seem smart.

00:27:45.900 --> 00:27:47.990
And the tradeoff is
completely unnecessary,

00:27:47.990 --> 00:27:50.360
because it actually
isn't accurate.

00:27:50.360 --> 00:27:51.920
Perception doesn't
work that way.

00:27:51.920 --> 00:27:55.210
People don't think you are less
smart just because you're warm.

00:27:55.210 --> 00:27:57.726
So again, be careful
of that, because you

00:27:57.726 --> 00:27:59.350
see that a lot, where
people think they

00:27:59.350 --> 00:28:01.500
have to seem tough
to seem smart.

00:28:01.500 --> 00:28:03.147
And that's not the case.

00:28:03.147 --> 00:28:05.480
The other thing is if you're
uncomfortable with the idea

00:28:05.480 --> 00:28:07.729
of warmth because you're
just really not a fuzzy bunny

00:28:07.729 --> 00:28:08.830
kind of person, that's OK.

00:28:08.830 --> 00:28:10.913
There are lots of ways to
show warmth that are not

00:28:10.913 --> 00:28:14.200
particularly mushy, like
being principled and being

00:28:14.200 --> 00:28:16.700
fair, and being transparent
and being loyal.

00:28:16.700 --> 00:28:19.590
All of these are ways of
showing warmth in that they

00:28:19.590 --> 00:28:21.620
show that you're on
the other person's side

00:28:21.620 --> 00:28:23.750
and you have good
intentions toward them,

00:28:23.750 --> 00:28:28.090
without actually having to
pull out any Kleenex-- so lots

00:28:28.090 --> 00:28:29.244
of ways to do it.

00:28:29.244 --> 00:28:30.660
The key thing,
really, is to think

00:28:30.660 --> 00:28:36.480
about doing it in a very
proactive and deliberate way.

00:28:36.480 --> 00:28:38.370
And by the way, a
great place to start

00:28:38.370 --> 00:28:40.290
is finding out whether
or not you actually

00:28:40.290 --> 00:28:42.030
do any of this stuff.

00:28:42.030 --> 00:28:43.990
So one of the
problems that happens

00:28:43.990 --> 00:28:46.490
is-- I give talks on this all
the time, and people will say,

00:28:46.490 --> 00:28:49.784
oh, I know that I
nod and smile a lot.

00:28:49.784 --> 00:28:52.200
And then the person next to
them is going, no, they don't.

00:28:52.200 --> 00:28:53.350
They don't actually
ever do that.

00:28:53.350 --> 00:28:55.016
Because we all think
we do these things,

00:28:55.016 --> 00:28:56.960
and then it turns
out that we don't.

00:28:56.960 --> 00:28:59.690
So one thing I recommend-- I
really recommend doing this.

00:28:59.690 --> 00:29:01.690
You sort of have to steel
yourself a little bit,

00:29:01.690 --> 00:29:05.414
but I get great feedback
from people when they do it.

00:29:05.414 --> 00:29:06.830
Find someone who's
worked with you

00:29:06.830 --> 00:29:09.080
for at least a little while,
who knows you pretty well

00:29:09.080 --> 00:29:12.060
and who you think you trust
to tell you the truth,

00:29:12.060 --> 00:29:14.210
and ask them to
answer this question.

00:29:14.210 --> 00:29:16.060
If I didn't know
you so well, I would

00:29:16.060 --> 00:29:18.410
think that you were blank.

00:29:18.410 --> 00:29:21.060
You hear all kinds of stuff when
you ask people this question.

00:29:21.060 --> 00:29:22.260
If I didn't know
you so well, I'd

00:29:22.260 --> 00:29:23.468
think that you were arrogant.

00:29:23.468 --> 00:29:24.950
If I didn't know
you so well, I'd

00:29:24.950 --> 00:29:27.760
think that you weren't very
bright, and so on and so on.

00:29:27.760 --> 00:29:29.456
And don't get mad.

00:29:29.456 --> 00:29:30.830
That's actually
really important.

00:29:30.830 --> 00:29:32.580
Don't get angry with
them for telling you.

00:29:32.580 --> 00:29:34.820
And then follow it up with, why?

00:29:34.820 --> 00:29:36.550
And you find out.

00:29:36.550 --> 00:29:38.670
People will tell you,
oh, it's because whenever

00:29:38.670 --> 00:29:40.780
we're in meetings,
you never look

00:29:40.780 --> 00:29:42.250
like you're paying attention.

00:29:42.250 --> 00:29:44.710
You look like you
can't be bothered.

00:29:44.710 --> 00:29:46.410
Or whenever we're
in meetings, you

00:29:46.410 --> 00:29:49.320
twirl your hair on your
finger, and it's really weird.

00:29:49.320 --> 00:29:51.016
And you find out, oh
my god, didn't even

00:29:51.016 --> 00:29:52.140
know that I was doing that.

00:29:52.140 --> 00:29:54.510
So it's very, very useful
as a starting place when

00:29:54.510 --> 00:29:57.910
you think about what you need to
do in order to send more warmth

00:29:57.910 --> 00:29:59.900
signals, or even more
competence signals,

00:29:59.900 --> 00:30:02.310
to find out what signals
are you sending now

00:30:02.310 --> 00:30:05.280
and to ask someone who
knows you better to say,

00:30:05.280 --> 00:30:08.270
you do actually do a few things
that I think maybe give people

00:30:08.270 --> 00:30:10.450
the wrong impression, and
here is what they are.

00:30:10.450 --> 00:30:11.730
It's a great place to start.

00:30:11.730 --> 00:30:14.590
Have a little courage,
and it totally pays off.

00:30:14.590 --> 00:30:19.850
OK, being likable-- here's the
thing about colleagues working

00:30:19.850 --> 00:30:23.400
together, is that
it's very easy--

00:30:23.400 --> 00:30:25.291
and especially a
place like Google,

00:30:25.291 --> 00:30:27.040
where you have a lot
of successful people,

00:30:27.040 --> 00:30:30.400
a lot of
achievement-oriented people--

00:30:30.400 --> 00:30:33.720
for one person on a team's
success to end up really,

00:30:33.720 --> 00:30:36.180
really bothering the
people around them,

00:30:36.180 --> 00:30:38.390
even if they don't
really realize it--

00:30:38.390 --> 00:30:39.460
and often they don't.

00:30:39.460 --> 00:30:42.450
Often it's not fully conscious
that the reason that I'm happy

00:30:42.450 --> 00:30:44.140
right now is that
you're so successful,

00:30:44.140 --> 00:30:45.320
but it happens all the time.

00:30:45.320 --> 00:30:48.000
Psychologists call
this ego threat.

00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:50.550
And it happens, once again,
as a function of two things.

00:30:50.550 --> 00:30:52.400
And no, I'm not going to use
the same sentence this time--

00:30:52.400 --> 00:30:54.474
it happens as a function
of two dimensions.

00:30:54.474 --> 00:30:55.890
So we are threatened
as a function

00:30:55.890 --> 00:30:58.780
of how relevant
someone's success is

00:30:58.780 --> 00:31:01.590
to the success we want to have.

00:31:01.590 --> 00:31:04.700
Are you successful at the thing
I want to be successful at?

00:31:04.700 --> 00:31:08.880
And closeness-- and
closeness here is basically,

00:31:08.880 --> 00:31:10.230
how much are you in my life?

00:31:10.230 --> 00:31:11.730
Do I have to see
you all the time?

00:31:11.730 --> 00:31:13.750
Am I constantly
reminded of the fact

00:31:13.750 --> 00:31:16.030
that you are successful at this?

00:31:16.030 --> 00:31:19.060
High threat occurs when these
two things are both high--

00:31:19.060 --> 00:31:21.770
when you have someone who is
successful at the thing you

00:31:21.770 --> 00:31:23.210
want to be successful
at, and you

00:31:23.210 --> 00:31:24.540
have to see them all the time.

00:31:24.540 --> 00:31:27.970
So again, sort of a famous
example, the Bush brothers

00:31:27.970 --> 00:31:32.170
wanting literally the same
job, which not many people get,

00:31:32.170 --> 00:31:34.582
and close by virtue
of the fact that they

00:31:34.582 --> 00:31:35.540
are in the same family.

00:31:35.540 --> 00:31:37.095
But interestingly,
this does seem

00:31:37.095 --> 00:31:38.970
to have created a lot
of threat between them,

00:31:38.970 --> 00:31:41.210
because they aren't
very close in the sense

00:31:41.210 --> 00:31:44.140
that they don't hang out
together very much, as far as I

00:31:44.140 --> 00:31:45.190
know-- so high threat.

00:31:45.190 --> 00:31:47.240
And this happens
with siblings a lot.

00:31:47.240 --> 00:31:49.850
When two siblings actually want
to be good at the same thing,

00:31:49.850 --> 00:31:53.062
it can create a lot of
tension in a family.

00:31:53.062 --> 00:31:55.270
Here's an interesting case,
and I'll come back to it.

00:31:55.270 --> 00:31:58.430
It should also be the case
for the Williams sisters.

00:31:58.430 --> 00:32:01.480
Serena and Venus
Williams should be

00:32:01.480 --> 00:32:02.850
very threatened by one another.

00:32:02.850 --> 00:32:04.610
They're very close,
and their successes

00:32:04.610 --> 00:32:06.930
are very relevant
to one another.

00:32:06.930 --> 00:32:07.620
But they're not.

00:32:07.620 --> 00:32:09.710
And so I'll come back to
that one in a little bit.

00:32:09.710 --> 00:32:11.500
A moderate threat
is created when

00:32:11.500 --> 00:32:14.462
you have high relevance but
lower closeness-- so someone

00:32:14.462 --> 00:32:16.670
is trying to be successful
at the same thing you are,

00:32:16.670 --> 00:32:18.890
but you don't have to
see them all the time.

00:32:18.890 --> 00:32:21.560
So here we have-- that is real.

00:32:21.560 --> 00:32:22.960
That is not a
photoshopped photo.

00:32:22.960 --> 00:32:24.140
He does that.

00:32:24.140 --> 00:32:26.550
So you would think,
again, both sort

00:32:26.550 --> 00:32:29.970
of wanting to be
leaders of the world,

00:32:29.970 --> 00:32:32.682
but they probably can
go whole days at a time

00:32:32.682 --> 00:32:34.140
without thinking
about one another.

00:32:34.140 --> 00:32:37.160
So the threat is a
little bit lessened.

00:32:37.160 --> 00:32:42.760
The ideal cell to be in is the
basking in the reflected glory

00:32:42.760 --> 00:32:44.432
cell, which is you're
close to someone

00:32:44.432 --> 00:32:45.890
but they're successful
in something

00:32:45.890 --> 00:32:47.860
that is completely
irrelevant to you,

00:32:47.860 --> 00:32:50.170
that you do not define
yourself at all.

00:32:50.170 --> 00:32:52.580
And here's a fun piece
of trivia to whip out

00:32:52.580 --> 00:32:54.760
at your next cocktail party.

00:32:54.760 --> 00:32:57.150
Ira Glass and Philip
Glass are cousins.

00:32:57.150 --> 00:32:59.220
And so they can
get together-- so

00:32:59.220 --> 00:33:02.045
Ira Glass, the "This American
Life" host, Phillip Glass,

00:33:02.045 --> 00:33:03.170
the composer-- are cousins.

00:33:03.170 --> 00:33:06.020
So they can get
together and just

00:33:06.020 --> 00:33:08.230
bask in how awesome
it is to be a Glass,

00:33:08.230 --> 00:33:10.040
and just enjoy each
other's success,

00:33:10.040 --> 00:33:11.680
and there is no threat there.

00:33:11.680 --> 00:33:13.110
It's just terrific.

00:33:13.110 --> 00:33:14.610
And then just to
sort around it out,

00:33:14.610 --> 00:33:17.760
again, obviously if you have
no closeness or relevance,

00:33:17.760 --> 00:33:19.160
there is no threat.

00:33:19.160 --> 00:33:23.640
That one might be photoshopped,
but I love it so much.

00:33:23.640 --> 00:33:25.000
I don't care.

00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:26.227
[LAUGHTER]

00:33:26.227 --> 00:33:28.310
Presumably they don't
threaten one another at all.

00:33:28.310 --> 00:33:30.190
OK, so how do you deal with it?

00:33:30.190 --> 00:33:32.734
So if you are in the
situation that a lot of people

00:33:32.734 --> 00:33:34.150
are in the workplace,
where you're

00:33:34.150 --> 00:33:36.870
working with people who
are doing very similar work

00:33:36.870 --> 00:33:40.210
to your own, their successes
may be threatening to you,

00:33:40.210 --> 00:33:43.730
or in this case, your successes
may be threatening to them.

00:33:43.730 --> 00:33:45.099
How do people deal with that?

00:33:45.099 --> 00:33:47.640
Well, a couple of ways-- you
can kind of think of the problem

00:33:47.640 --> 00:33:49.850
as being you're too
close and too comparable.

00:33:49.850 --> 00:33:52.010
You're like two apples.

00:33:52.010 --> 00:33:54.700
So one solution is you
can decrease relevance.

00:33:54.700 --> 00:33:56.690
One of you can become an orange.

00:33:56.690 --> 00:33:58.920
This is actually what
many siblings do in order

00:33:58.920 --> 00:34:02.940
to stop killing each
other-- most famously,

00:34:02.940 --> 00:34:04.620
probably, the Emanuel brothers.

00:34:04.620 --> 00:34:06.485
So one is a politician,
one is a doctor,

00:34:06.485 --> 00:34:07.955
and one is a Hollywood agent.

00:34:07.955 --> 00:34:10.080
Interestingly, when they
were all children-- and so

00:34:10.080 --> 00:34:11.219
therefore, much
more comparable--

00:34:11.219 --> 00:34:13.449
they basically beat each
other up every single day.

00:34:13.449 --> 00:34:15.960
But now as adults, they
get along quite well

00:34:15.960 --> 00:34:19.710
because they're very successful
in very different domains.

00:34:19.710 --> 00:34:22.090
Another thing you can do is
try to decrease closeness.

00:34:22.090 --> 00:34:23.730
You can try to just
literally get away

00:34:23.730 --> 00:34:26.710
from the person who
is threatening you.

00:34:26.710 --> 00:34:29.020
That's what these two
gentlemen did for years.

00:34:29.020 --> 00:34:32.250
They basically tried to avoid
each other at all costs.

00:34:32.250 --> 00:34:33.510
This is sort of later in life.

00:34:33.510 --> 00:34:35.210
You can just see Bill
Gates' posture is

00:34:35.210 --> 00:34:37.126
still like, I'm literally
trying to get as far

00:34:37.126 --> 00:34:39.580
away from you as I
can in this chair,

00:34:39.580 --> 00:34:41.739
because they had a
relationship that threatened

00:34:41.739 --> 00:34:44.090
one another quite a bit.

00:34:44.090 --> 00:34:46.380
OK, what if you can't do
either of those things?

00:34:46.380 --> 00:34:48.030
Like most of you,
you're on a team.

00:34:48.030 --> 00:34:49.750
You really can't
go be an orange,

00:34:49.750 --> 00:34:52.249
and you can't really get away
from the people you work with.

00:34:52.249 --> 00:34:53.510
So how do you deal with it?

00:34:53.510 --> 00:34:55.440
Well, what most
people do when they

00:34:55.440 --> 00:34:57.490
don't have any other
options left is

00:34:57.490 --> 00:35:02.840
they just decide to basically
not like you anymore.

00:35:02.840 --> 00:35:04.299
They find something
wrong with you.

00:35:04.299 --> 00:35:05.714
That's how they
deal with the fact

00:35:05.714 --> 00:35:07.770
that you're threatening
to them, is they decide,

00:35:07.770 --> 00:35:10.480
you're not so great, and they
find some way to take you down

00:35:10.480 --> 00:35:11.290
a notch.

00:35:11.290 --> 00:35:13.850
And this is obviously
what we want to avoid.

00:35:13.850 --> 00:35:15.170
This is the problem.

00:35:15.170 --> 00:35:17.590
When your success threatens
the people around you,

00:35:17.590 --> 00:35:19.489
they will find ways
to not like you

00:35:19.489 --> 00:35:21.280
so that they can feel
better about the fact

00:35:21.280 --> 00:35:22.370
that they're threatened.

00:35:22.370 --> 00:35:24.140
And you can say that's
horrible and terrible,

00:35:24.140 --> 00:35:25.180
but we all kind of do it.

00:35:25.180 --> 00:35:26.710
And they don't realize
they're doing it,

00:35:26.710 --> 00:35:28.930
so it's not really like
they're doing it on purpose.

00:35:28.930 --> 00:35:31.720
So how do we avoid this problem?

00:35:31.720 --> 00:35:34.084
You avoid this problem by
switching from my apple

00:35:34.084 --> 00:35:35.730
is better than your apple to
we are the best damn basket

00:35:35.730 --> 00:35:36.646
of apples around here.

00:35:38.380 --> 00:35:42.560
You create a sense of us
so that one person's win

00:35:42.560 --> 00:35:44.570
is a win for everyone.

00:35:44.570 --> 00:35:46.146
And this is really,
really important,

00:35:46.146 --> 00:35:48.020
and is incredibly
important in the workplace,

00:35:48.020 --> 00:35:50.230
for teams to have
this sort of identity,

00:35:50.230 --> 00:35:53.010
especially when there's a really
high likelihood that people

00:35:53.010 --> 00:35:55.160
can threaten one
another in the team.

00:35:55.160 --> 00:35:58.790
There's basically three really
effective ways to do this.

00:35:58.790 --> 00:36:03.152
One is to create a
strong team identity.

00:36:03.152 --> 00:36:04.610
You can do that
any number of ways.

00:36:04.610 --> 00:36:09.000
I mean, the easiest way to do it
is to have a common enemy-- not

00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:11.010
someone also in Google, please.

00:36:11.010 --> 00:36:12.870
Please pick someone
outside the company

00:36:12.870 --> 00:36:14.940
to have as your common enemy.

00:36:14.940 --> 00:36:17.620
But a common enemy can
create, very easily,

00:36:17.620 --> 00:36:19.720
a strong team identity.

00:36:19.720 --> 00:36:23.330
But also, just sort of talking
about the team as a team a lot,

00:36:23.330 --> 00:36:25.310
and talking about
your shared goals.

00:36:25.310 --> 00:36:27.250
I tell managers all the
time that there really

00:36:27.250 --> 00:36:29.640
shouldn't be a meeting that
gets started without talking

00:36:29.640 --> 00:36:31.110
about what the goals
are for the team,

00:36:31.110 --> 00:36:33.360
without talking about the
accomplishments of the team,

00:36:33.360 --> 00:36:36.270
without talking about everything
in the context of a team.

00:36:36.270 --> 00:36:39.210
And you have to do it
so much that you'll

00:36:39.210 --> 00:36:41.460
start to think it's weird,
but it's actually not weird

00:36:41.460 --> 00:36:43.418
because what you're doing
every single time you

00:36:43.418 --> 00:36:45.620
do that is making that team
identity very accessible

00:36:45.620 --> 00:36:47.620
for the people in the
room, and you're making it

00:36:47.620 --> 00:36:49.370
more and more the way
they would typically

00:36:49.370 --> 00:36:51.240
think about what they do.

00:36:51.240 --> 00:36:53.490
To the extent that you can
incentivize them as a team,

00:36:53.490 --> 00:36:55.080
that's a good thing.

00:36:55.080 --> 00:36:57.640
But anything you can do to take
the focus off the individuals

00:36:57.640 --> 00:37:00.160
in the team and really
celebrate the team as a whole

00:37:00.160 --> 00:37:02.620
starts to deal
with this problem.

00:37:02.620 --> 00:37:04.267
And then the last
bit is celebrating

00:37:04.267 --> 00:37:05.100
other people's wins.

00:37:05.100 --> 00:37:08.080
And this is something
each of us can do more of.

00:37:08.080 --> 00:37:11.390
We can try to remove
some of the tension

00:37:11.390 --> 00:37:13.380
by you taking the first step.

00:37:13.380 --> 00:37:15.400
Again, human beings
are incredibly

00:37:15.400 --> 00:37:16.760
reciprocal by nature.

00:37:16.760 --> 00:37:19.810
If you go up to someone else
and celebrate the heck out

00:37:19.810 --> 00:37:21.551
of their win and
say how great it is

00:37:21.551 --> 00:37:23.300
and how proud you are
to be on their team,

00:37:23.300 --> 00:37:24.610
because they're doing
so great, they're

00:37:24.610 --> 00:37:26.760
going to be more likely
to do that back to you.

00:37:26.760 --> 00:37:28.490
So you can defuse a
lot of the tension.

00:37:28.490 --> 00:37:30.260
If you suspect that there
are people around you that

00:37:30.260 --> 00:37:31.718
are a little bit
threatened by you,

00:37:31.718 --> 00:37:33.200
the one way to
diffuse that tension

00:37:33.200 --> 00:37:36.620
is to actually go and celebrate
them and make a big show of it.

00:37:36.620 --> 00:37:38.122
And when you do
that, it actually

00:37:38.122 --> 00:37:39.580
will help to create
the sense of us

00:37:39.580 --> 00:37:41.200
and make it so
that when you win,

00:37:41.200 --> 00:37:42.970
they're going to actually be
kind of excited about that,

00:37:42.970 --> 00:37:44.720
and they can bask in
the reflected glory

00:37:44.720 --> 00:37:48.932
of your awesomeness rather
than feel threatened by it.

00:37:48.932 --> 00:37:50.390
So that's basically
actually what's

00:37:50.390 --> 00:37:51.848
happened with the
Williams sisters.

00:37:51.848 --> 00:37:54.410
If you read interviews with them
or know anything about them,

00:37:54.410 --> 00:37:56.960
you find that the way they
talk about themselves is they

00:37:56.960 --> 00:37:59.107
talk about themselves
as the Williams family.

00:37:59.107 --> 00:38:01.440
And that really seems to be
the sort of primary identity

00:38:01.440 --> 00:38:02.210
that they have.

00:38:02.210 --> 00:38:04.907
So a win for any Williams is
a win for the Williams family.

00:38:04.907 --> 00:38:06.740
They actually perform
usually at their worst

00:38:06.740 --> 00:38:08.323
when they're playing
with one another,

00:38:08.323 --> 00:38:10.670
because it's very hard
for them to process that.

00:38:10.670 --> 00:38:13.350
But they love it when
the other one wins,

00:38:13.350 --> 00:38:15.470
and they really feel
like it's their win.

00:38:15.470 --> 00:38:17.660
And that's something
that actually any team

00:38:17.660 --> 00:38:20.200
can accomplish if team
identity is something

00:38:20.200 --> 00:38:22.600
that you really focus on.

00:38:22.600 --> 00:38:25.450
So what's in it for you, if
you do all this extra work?

00:38:25.450 --> 00:38:28.549
If you decide that
you're going to take

00:38:28.549 --> 00:38:31.090
a little bit of extra time and
effort and send these signals,

00:38:31.090 --> 00:38:32.200
what's in it for you?

00:38:32.200 --> 00:38:33.880
A psychologist
named David Funder

00:38:33.880 --> 00:38:36.570
has spent quite
a bit of his time

00:38:36.570 --> 00:38:39.280
studying people who are
what he calls good targets.

00:38:39.280 --> 00:38:42.490
Some of us are a little bit
more easily judged than others.

00:38:42.490 --> 00:38:44.646
Some of us are
sending these signals

00:38:44.646 --> 00:38:46.270
that help other people
to understand us

00:38:46.270 --> 00:38:49.480
and to read our
intentions correctly.

00:38:49.480 --> 00:38:51.230
And so he's studied
these good targets

00:38:51.230 --> 00:38:53.520
to see how do their lives
different than people

00:38:53.520 --> 00:38:55.020
who are not good targets.

00:38:55.020 --> 00:38:56.750
And he's found a
number of things.

00:38:56.750 --> 00:39:00.284
First of all, good targets
make better first impressions.

00:39:00.284 --> 00:39:02.700
That turns out to be, as I
said, a really important thing.

00:39:02.700 --> 00:39:04.200
If you're better
at sending signals,

00:39:04.200 --> 00:39:06.410
you make the right first
impression from the get-go

00:39:06.410 --> 00:39:08.980
rather than having to spend
a whole bunch of time undoing

00:39:08.980 --> 00:39:10.890
the damage you've done.

00:39:10.890 --> 00:39:14.500
Good targets have much more
satisfying relationships.

00:39:14.500 --> 00:39:16.870
They report being much
happier in their relationships

00:39:16.870 --> 00:39:18.350
that they're in.

00:39:18.350 --> 00:39:20.880
Good targets enjoying
more social support,

00:39:20.880 --> 00:39:23.130
both professionally
and personally.

00:39:23.130 --> 00:39:25.324
They have more
people in their lives

00:39:25.324 --> 00:39:27.240
who can help them when
they need help in order

00:39:27.240 --> 00:39:29.370
to achieve the things
they want to achieve.

00:39:29.370 --> 00:39:34.250
And finally, good targets have
consistently greater happiness

00:39:34.250 --> 00:39:36.040
and well-being.

00:39:36.040 --> 00:39:38.090
And these things seem
like good things, right?

00:39:38.090 --> 00:39:41.400
This is definitely, I
think, worth thinking about,

00:39:41.400 --> 00:39:44.302
how you can become
a better target.

00:39:44.302 --> 00:39:45.260
I mean, it's up to you.

00:39:45.260 --> 00:39:46.330
You have a choice.

00:39:46.330 --> 00:39:51.350
You can either sort of sit back
and be unhappy that nobody ever

00:39:51.350 --> 00:39:53.820
seems to understand you,
and just cry about it,

00:39:53.820 --> 00:39:57.400
or you can take a little
bit of extra effort,

00:39:57.400 --> 00:39:59.530
you can be a little
bit more strategic,

00:39:59.530 --> 00:40:03.680
and you can really take
steps to bridge that gap--

00:40:03.680 --> 00:40:06.121
and to finally,
much more reliably,

00:40:06.121 --> 00:40:08.370
come across the way you
intend to with the people that

00:40:08.370 --> 00:40:10.710
are important to you.

00:40:10.710 --> 00:40:11.580
And so that is all.

00:40:11.580 --> 00:40:14.600
So I will take questions with
whatever time we have left.

00:40:14.600 --> 00:40:15.690
And there's a microphone.

00:40:15.690 --> 00:40:18.680
So please use it,
or chaos will ensue.

00:40:24.524 --> 00:40:25.024
[INAUDIBLE]

00:40:28.940 --> 00:40:30.375
AUDIENCE: Hello.

00:40:30.375 --> 00:40:34.880
I was just wondering how this
is involved with performers.

00:40:34.880 --> 00:40:40.190
How would they want to display
their sort of performing

00:40:40.190 --> 00:40:43.179
abilities or their image?

00:40:43.179 --> 00:40:44.595
HEIDI GRANT
HALVORSON: Sort of you

00:40:44.595 --> 00:40:46.040
want the audience to like you?

00:40:46.040 --> 00:40:47.710
That kind of idea?

00:40:47.710 --> 00:40:48.416
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:40:48.416 --> 00:40:51.150
HEIDI GRANT HALVORSON: I
think that there again, it

00:40:51.150 --> 00:40:54.470
boils down to trying to
send as many warmth signals

00:40:54.470 --> 00:40:55.160
as possible.

00:40:55.160 --> 00:41:00.760
So among speakers, you see
a lot of variety in this.

00:41:00.760 --> 00:41:03.180
You see that some people
do actually make a point

00:41:03.180 --> 00:41:06.730
of looking at the audience,
and some people don't.

00:41:06.730 --> 00:41:08.420
Their eyes are
sort of everywhere.

00:41:08.420 --> 00:41:10.640
I think simple
things, like looking

00:41:10.640 --> 00:41:15.540
like you're actually speaking
to an actual person is helpful.

00:41:15.540 --> 00:41:17.070
Humor is really good.

00:41:17.070 --> 00:41:19.825
You always have to be a
little bit careful with humor.

00:41:19.825 --> 00:41:21.830
You don't want to make
fun of other people.

00:41:21.830 --> 00:41:23.290
That's not a great
way to be warm.

00:41:23.290 --> 00:41:24.956
But making fun of
yourself a little bit,

00:41:24.956 --> 00:41:29.250
or humor that is based on
sort of common problems,

00:41:29.250 --> 00:41:32.110
like were-all-in-the-same-boat
kind of things.

00:41:32.110 --> 00:41:35.360
That can be a really, I
think, great sign of warmth.

00:41:35.360 --> 00:41:37.962
But I think anytime you can
create a situation where you're

00:41:37.962 --> 00:41:40.420
feeling like you're having a
genuine connection with people

00:41:40.420 --> 00:41:43.972
and they're actual individuals,
anything individuating

00:41:43.972 --> 00:41:45.680
is sort of helpful--
that you're not just

00:41:45.680 --> 00:41:47.900
treating it like a crowd.

00:41:47.900 --> 00:41:50.030
Those things can be helpful.

00:41:50.030 --> 00:41:51.750
It's a lot of the
same things, actually,

00:41:51.750 --> 00:41:53.830
that you would just say
you should do to someone

00:41:53.830 --> 00:41:55.730
you're talking to on
the street, right?

00:41:55.730 --> 00:41:57.650
It's not that different.

00:41:57.650 --> 00:41:59.560
It's a little more
challenging when

00:41:59.560 --> 00:42:01.847
it's you talking to
a roomful of people,

00:42:01.847 --> 00:42:03.930
but I think a lot of the
same signals can be sent.

00:42:03.930 --> 00:42:07.100
And one of the
other challenges--

00:42:07.100 --> 00:42:09.272
you just reminded me.

00:42:09.272 --> 00:42:11.230
One of the other big
issues with sending warmth

00:42:11.230 --> 00:42:13.890
is when-- face to
face interactions

00:42:13.890 --> 00:42:15.390
is actually relatively easy.

00:42:15.390 --> 00:42:16.990
But when you move
to either one person

00:42:16.990 --> 00:42:20.230
talking to a whole roomful of
people or you move, even worse,

00:42:20.230 --> 00:42:24.210
to phone conversations-- or
even worse than that, to email

00:42:24.210 --> 00:42:27.570
conversations--
then you lose a lot

00:42:27.570 --> 00:42:30.196
of ways in which human beings
show warmth to one another.

00:42:30.196 --> 00:42:30.820
And it's funny.

00:42:30.820 --> 00:42:33.430
I think we write
emails to people--

00:42:33.430 --> 00:42:35.062
we speak to people
over email in ways

00:42:35.062 --> 00:42:37.270
that we would never speak
to another human being face

00:42:37.270 --> 00:42:38.555
to face.

00:42:38.555 --> 00:42:40.180
You would never just
walk up to someone

00:42:40.180 --> 00:42:42.430
and launch immediately into
what you want from them.

00:42:42.430 --> 00:42:44.804
It would always begin with a
sort of, hey, how you doing?

00:42:44.804 --> 00:42:46.790
Oh, last week I remember
you were working on x.

00:42:46.790 --> 00:42:48.331
And I totally think
there's no reason

00:42:48.331 --> 00:42:50.780
you can't start an
email just like that, as

00:42:50.780 --> 00:42:52.520
if it is a conversation.

00:42:52.520 --> 00:42:54.142
The tone feels very different.

00:42:54.142 --> 00:42:55.420
But emails are consistent.

00:42:55.420 --> 00:42:57.910
No one ever sent a warmer
email than they meant to.

00:42:57.910 --> 00:43:00.840
It's always that it comes across
colder or more rude or more

00:43:00.840 --> 00:43:03.530
distant, because we're missing
a lot of those ways in which we

00:43:03.530 --> 00:43:05.150
send those cues.

00:43:05.150 --> 00:43:07.030
Also, video-conferencing
is amazing.

00:43:07.030 --> 00:43:09.480
And I always tell people
to go the extra mile.

00:43:09.480 --> 00:43:12.670
I know it's a pain, but if
you can get face-to-face

00:43:12.670 --> 00:43:16.320
in a meeting rather than
having people dial in,

00:43:16.320 --> 00:43:19.270
you lose a lot of the risk
of a lot of those coldness

00:43:19.270 --> 00:43:20.856
and other issues
that can creep in.

00:43:20.856 --> 00:43:21.980
Thank you for the question.

00:43:21.980 --> 00:43:22.479
Yeah?

00:43:22.479 --> 00:43:24.420
AUDIENCE: Yeah, howdy.

00:43:24.420 --> 00:43:27.240
I want to go back to the
strong team identity.

00:43:27.240 --> 00:43:29.740
You mentioned the easiest way,
or any easy way that people

00:43:29.740 --> 00:43:31.554
do that, is by finding
a common enemy.

00:43:31.554 --> 00:43:32.720
HEIDI GRANT HALVORSON: Yeah.

00:43:32.720 --> 00:43:34.810
AUDIENCE: Does it have to
be a person or a group?

00:43:34.810 --> 00:43:37.000
Could it be something like
the bugs that we have,

00:43:37.000 --> 00:43:38.335
or just inefficiency in general?

00:43:38.335 --> 00:43:39.460
HEIDI GRANT HALVORSON: Yes.

00:43:39.460 --> 00:43:43.120
Yes, because people love to
sort of anthropomorphize things.

00:43:43.120 --> 00:43:47.980
So if you talk about a
thing like it's an enemy,

00:43:47.980 --> 00:43:50.470
that works completely.

00:43:50.470 --> 00:43:52.859
A particular problem-- we're
up against this problem.

00:43:52.859 --> 00:43:53.650
We're going to win.

00:43:53.650 --> 00:43:54.680
We're going to
beat this problem.

00:43:54.680 --> 00:43:56.500
And you talk about it
like it's a person,

00:43:56.500 --> 00:43:59.010
then you get the same
psychological mechanism

00:43:59.010 --> 00:44:00.800
sort of kicking in.

00:44:00.800 --> 00:44:05.460
What you're trying to
activate is-- our brains

00:44:05.460 --> 00:44:08.320
are basically wired
to have very strong

00:44:08.320 --> 00:44:09.850
ingroup-outgroup distinctions.

00:44:09.850 --> 00:44:12.840
So we identify people as
either in-group or out-group,

00:44:12.840 --> 00:44:14.474
and we operate in those terms.

00:44:14.474 --> 00:44:16.640
And so you're trying, when
you mention team identity

00:44:16.640 --> 00:44:18.098
and talk about all
of those things,

00:44:18.098 --> 00:44:20.060
you're really trying
to kick that into gear

00:44:20.060 --> 00:44:22.130
and have the brains of
everybody in the room

00:44:22.130 --> 00:44:24.550
see one another as all in-group.

00:44:24.550 --> 00:44:29.054
And you can do that with real
outgroup, like real enemies,

00:44:29.054 --> 00:44:30.720
but you can actually
do it with anything

00:44:30.720 --> 00:44:34.740
that threatens the people
who are in that group.

00:44:34.740 --> 00:44:35.740
That works as well.

00:44:35.740 --> 00:44:37.500
So yeah, and that's
actually a great way

00:44:37.500 --> 00:44:39.958
to solve the problem, where
you don't have to actually have

00:44:39.958 --> 00:44:43.640
an enemy team but you can
have the enemy be just about

00:44:43.640 --> 00:44:44.880
anything.

00:44:44.880 --> 00:44:45.617
That's great.

00:44:45.617 --> 00:44:47.450
AUDIENCE: I had a
question on a similar line

00:44:47.450 --> 00:44:50.170
to that with the whole
ego threat thing.

00:44:50.170 --> 00:44:54.050
And it involves what
if it's a relationship

00:44:54.050 --> 00:44:57.860
and the goals involved are a
more broad thing, like career

00:44:57.860 --> 00:45:01.417
or salary success,
money-- things like that?

00:45:01.417 --> 00:45:03.250
HEIDI GRANT HALVORSON:
What's the relation--

00:45:03.250 --> 00:45:04.370
AUDIENCE: It's like a
marriage, for instance.

00:45:04.370 --> 00:45:05.560
HEIDI GRANT HALVORSON:
Oh yeah, and you have

00:45:05.560 --> 00:45:07.130
ego threat in the marriage?

00:45:07.130 --> 00:45:09.740
AUDIENCE: Where one partner
is succeeding at a career,

00:45:09.740 --> 00:45:11.240
succeeding in a
business-- something

00:45:11.240 --> 00:45:13.156
like that-- where the
other partner struggles.

00:45:13.156 --> 00:45:14.480
That seems like a--

00:45:14.480 --> 00:45:16.290
HEIDI GRANT HALVORSON: Yeah,
it's a huge problem, isn't it?

00:45:16.290 --> 00:45:16.900
It is.

00:45:16.900 --> 00:45:20.810
It's actually a huge,
huge, huge problem.

00:45:20.810 --> 00:45:27.320
One of the reasons why--
it's a big problem regardless

00:45:27.320 --> 00:45:29.290
of the genders of the
individuals involved.

00:45:29.290 --> 00:45:33.210
However, traditionally,
it often seems

00:45:33.210 --> 00:45:35.954
to be a larger problem for
men, in part because women--

00:45:35.954 --> 00:45:37.370
it's not because
women are saints,

00:45:37.370 --> 00:45:39.540
but because women have
more of a tendency

00:45:39.540 --> 00:45:42.580
to see themselves as an "us."

00:45:42.580 --> 00:45:46.012
So women just sort of--
again, this is an on-average.

00:45:46.012 --> 00:45:46.970
Everybody is different.

00:45:46.970 --> 00:45:49.740
But on average, women
have a greater tendency

00:45:49.740 --> 00:45:53.420
to self-identify as an us
rather than as an individual.

00:45:53.420 --> 00:45:56.060
And so therefore, when they have
a partner who is doing really

00:45:56.060 --> 00:45:59.030
well, they can at least
have a better shot at doing

00:45:59.030 --> 00:46:02.360
the bask-in-the-reflected-glory
part.

00:46:02.360 --> 00:46:05.200
Men, who tend to be
more individualistic

00:46:05.200 --> 00:46:07.690
and identify just
as an individual,

00:46:07.690 --> 00:46:09.110
that tends to be more difficult.

00:46:09.110 --> 00:46:11.780
But again, it can happen
with both genders.

00:46:11.780 --> 00:46:13.880
It definitely is a
source of conflict.

00:46:13.880 --> 00:46:18.540
And the answer is that you end
up diminishing closeness, often

00:46:18.540 --> 00:46:21.930
through things like divorce
and choosing different partners

00:46:21.930 --> 00:46:23.400
that don't threaten you.

00:46:23.400 --> 00:46:24.650
So it is absolutely a problem.

00:46:24.650 --> 00:46:27.770
I think the people
that deal with it

00:46:27.770 --> 00:46:30.650
the best tend to be people
who have found a way

00:46:30.650 --> 00:46:32.480
to make it an "us"
thing, to make

00:46:32.480 --> 00:46:34.580
your success is my success.

00:46:34.580 --> 00:46:36.710
But I always marvel
at couples who

00:46:36.710 --> 00:46:40.840
seem to be doing the same
work and who can manage that,

00:46:40.840 --> 00:46:43.170
because I think that the
potential for conflict

00:46:43.170 --> 00:46:45.660
is so great there that it's
sort of amazing that they

00:46:45.660 --> 00:46:46.510
can make it work.

00:46:46.510 --> 00:46:47.010
Yeah.

00:46:47.010 --> 00:46:49.220
And it happens in friendships.

00:46:49.220 --> 00:46:51.940
You see in many instances,
friends drift apart

00:46:51.940 --> 00:46:53.850
because one becomes
more successful

00:46:53.850 --> 00:46:55.630
and that just becomes
a source of tension.

00:46:55.630 --> 00:46:56.427
Absolutely.

00:46:56.427 --> 00:46:57.710
Anybody else?

00:46:57.710 --> 00:46:59.796
AUDIENCE: Yeah, because
I have a question, too.

00:46:59.796 --> 00:47:03.590
You mentioned that nobody
sends an email warmer

00:47:03.590 --> 00:47:05.182
than they expect it to be.

00:47:05.182 --> 00:47:08.760
So at Google here, we have
hundreds of emails a day.

00:47:08.760 --> 00:47:09.850
It's ridiculous.

00:47:09.850 --> 00:47:13.390
And so personally,
I'm always in conflict

00:47:13.390 --> 00:47:16.574
between trying to send
the shortest, quickest

00:47:16.574 --> 00:47:18.490
email out the door to
be as direct as possible

00:47:18.490 --> 00:47:22.800
while still balancing the
line between not coming across

00:47:22.800 --> 00:47:25.820
as a total jerk.

00:47:25.820 --> 00:47:28.160
Do you have any sort of
recommendation for the tone

00:47:28.160 --> 00:47:30.820
of what the email should take?

00:47:30.820 --> 00:47:34.400
Should I add more winky faces?

00:47:34.400 --> 00:47:36.650
HEIDI GRANT HALVORSON: I
mean, it's really interesting

00:47:36.650 --> 00:47:39.800
to see emojis seeping into
more and more business

00:47:39.800 --> 00:47:42.980
communication, because
they are needed, right?

00:47:42.980 --> 00:47:46.000
They're Substituting
for the tonal qualities

00:47:46.000 --> 00:47:47.810
that we don't have
in that format.

00:47:47.810 --> 00:47:49.250
We need to know you're winking.

00:47:49.250 --> 00:47:50.450
That's a joke.

00:47:50.450 --> 00:47:54.620
So I think we're going to see
that happening more and more,

00:47:54.620 --> 00:47:57.542
that more emojis become
a way we communicate.

00:47:57.542 --> 00:47:59.250
It's funny, because
I was at a conference

00:47:59.250 --> 00:48:01.950
talking about this with people
who were interested in doing

00:48:01.950 --> 00:48:03.650
chat with customers online.

00:48:03.650 --> 00:48:05.620
And they want those
conversations to be short.

00:48:05.620 --> 00:48:07.750
But they can also be warm.

00:48:07.750 --> 00:48:10.640
They don't have to be
lengthy, the warmth bits.

00:48:10.640 --> 00:48:13.470
So literally, hey,
how you doing?

00:48:13.470 --> 00:48:16.990
Literally, hey, how you doing is
a great way to start an email.

00:48:16.990 --> 00:48:18.490
It's amazing how
often we don't even

00:48:18.490 --> 00:48:21.640
bother to do that, that
we just go, Hi, Bob,

00:48:21.640 --> 00:48:22.820
I need the such and such.

00:48:22.820 --> 00:48:26.820
And so even just saying,
Hi, Bob, how are you doing,

00:48:26.820 --> 00:48:29.240
hope you're good, I
need the such and such,

00:48:29.240 --> 00:48:31.380
is much better email
than the other.

00:48:31.380 --> 00:48:34.730
So you don't have to
completely sacrifice brevity.

00:48:34.730 --> 00:48:37.490
Nobody also wants to read
epically long emails.

00:48:37.490 --> 00:48:40.900
And the questions are not
meant to be answered, really.

00:48:40.900 --> 00:48:42.950
There's those things
we do all the time when

00:48:42.950 --> 00:48:44.200
we interact with other people.

00:48:44.200 --> 00:48:45.241
We say, hey, how are you?

00:48:45.241 --> 00:48:45.756
Good.

00:48:45.756 --> 00:48:47.380
There's no information
exchanged there.

00:48:47.380 --> 00:48:49.840
That's just a greeting
that humans have, right?

00:48:49.840 --> 00:48:50.890
It's a little dance.

00:48:50.890 --> 00:48:54.080
And so you need to kind of do
that dance in other formats

00:48:54.080 --> 00:48:58.200
as well, because again, people
can't put their thumb on why

00:48:58.200 --> 00:49:00.720
they're annoyed with you
about the email you just sent.

00:49:00.720 --> 00:49:03.250
They won't know it's because
you didn't say hi, how are you,

00:49:03.250 --> 00:49:05.050
but that's not helping.

00:49:05.050 --> 00:49:08.480
So I think yeah, short
ways of being friendly

00:49:08.480 --> 00:49:09.962
can be very powerful.

00:49:09.962 --> 00:49:10.671
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:49:10.671 --> 00:49:12.045
HEIDI GRANT
HALVORSON: OK, great.

00:49:12.045 --> 00:49:12.640
Anybody else?

00:49:12.640 --> 00:49:13.723
AUDIENCE: One in the back.

00:49:20.430 --> 00:49:24.490
AUDIENCE: So you
talked about how

00:49:24.490 --> 00:49:28.630
we can help other people see
us the way we see ourselves.

00:49:28.630 --> 00:49:31.310
I know that there's other psych
research out there about how

00:49:31.310 --> 00:49:32.642
we see ourselves incorrectly.

00:49:32.642 --> 00:49:33.808
HEIDI GRANT HALVORSON: Yeah.

00:49:33.808 --> 00:49:36.148
[CHUCKLES]

00:49:36.148 --> 00:49:39.570
AUDIENCE: So in any
kind of conversation,

00:49:39.570 --> 00:49:41.270
kind of like a
combative conversation

00:49:41.270 --> 00:49:49.180
or a crucial conversation, what
do you think contributes more?

00:49:49.180 --> 00:49:54.590
Is it that I see myself
differently from what we might

00:49:54.590 --> 00:49:57.217
think of as reality, or that--

00:49:57.217 --> 00:49:58.800
HEIDI GRANT HALVORSON:
The gap, right?

00:49:58.800 --> 00:50:01.599
How much of the gap is I don't
understand myself very well,

00:50:01.599 --> 00:50:03.390
and how much of the
gap is the other person

00:50:03.390 --> 00:50:05.830
does not understand me.

00:50:05.830 --> 00:50:06.890
That's really a question.

00:50:06.890 --> 00:50:09.280
And there isn't any
one answer to that,

00:50:09.280 --> 00:50:11.940
except to say that they're
both big contributors.

00:50:11.940 --> 00:50:14.960
And certainly, the more you
find that other people all

00:50:14.960 --> 00:50:17.350
have the same opinion about
you but you're different,

00:50:17.350 --> 00:50:19.558
that's where you start to
suspect maybe they're right

00:50:19.558 --> 00:50:21.380
and you're wrong.

00:50:21.380 --> 00:50:24.457
So certainly, part of the reason
the correlations aren't perfect

00:50:24.457 --> 00:50:26.540
is that sometimes other
people do see things in us

00:50:26.540 --> 00:50:29.850
that we don't see in ourselves.

00:50:29.850 --> 00:50:33.324
I think you fix probably
more than 50% of the problem

00:50:33.324 --> 00:50:35.740
if you start realizing that
you're doing a bunch of things

00:50:35.740 --> 00:50:37.050
you don't mean to be doing.

00:50:37.050 --> 00:50:40.580
I think most miscommunication
comes from that, not

00:50:40.580 --> 00:50:42.890
from a lack of
self-understanding

00:50:42.890 --> 00:50:45.290
about who you are and
what your intentions are,

00:50:45.290 --> 00:50:49.000
but a lack of self-awareness
about how the behaviors you're

00:50:49.000 --> 00:50:51.780
engaging in are being
perceived by other people.

00:50:55.040 --> 00:50:56.554
When you have a
misunderstanding,

00:50:56.554 --> 00:50:57.970
when you feel like
you didn't come

00:50:57.970 --> 00:50:59.928
across the way you intended
to, your intentions

00:50:59.928 --> 00:51:01.330
were good, right?

00:51:01.330 --> 00:51:03.170
It's just that the
execution was flawed.

00:51:03.170 --> 00:51:05.160
That's probably
more of the problem

00:51:05.160 --> 00:51:07.500
than it is the I wasn't
really honest with myself

00:51:07.500 --> 00:51:09.582
about what my intentions
were in the first place.

00:51:09.582 --> 00:51:11.290
But of course, that
can be a problem too.

00:51:11.290 --> 00:51:13.930
So self-awareness helps
for a couple of reasons.

00:51:13.930 --> 00:51:15.780
It helps you to really
understand yourself,

00:51:15.780 --> 00:51:18.770
but also helps you to
cultivate some sense of,

00:51:18.770 --> 00:51:22.500
what is it that I'm doing and
how is that being perceived?

00:51:22.500 --> 00:51:25.210
I focus on that in this book,
because I feel like, especially

00:51:25.210 --> 00:51:27.490
in the workplace, that's
the bigger problem.

00:51:27.490 --> 00:51:32.100
But we could all also do with
a big dose of self-awareness,

00:51:32.100 --> 00:51:32.600
as well.

00:51:32.600 --> 00:51:36.020
You're right to point out
that it's not all them.

00:51:36.020 --> 00:51:38.190
Some of it's you.

00:51:38.190 --> 00:51:41.410
So thank you.

00:51:41.410 --> 00:51:43.762
One here, I think?

00:51:43.762 --> 00:51:45.470
AUDIENCE: This will
be the last question.

00:51:45.470 --> 00:51:48.440
We're out of time here.

00:51:48.440 --> 00:51:52.450
AUDIENCE: So I've
found lately that a lot

00:51:52.450 --> 00:51:55.880
of my issues with
interacting with other people

00:51:55.880 --> 00:52:01.310
is not being able to find
relevant competence in others

00:52:01.310 --> 00:52:06.110
related to things that I
identify with as unique to me.

00:52:06.110 --> 00:52:10.000
So do you have any
advice for kind

00:52:10.000 --> 00:52:13.950
of both sides of
it-- either avenues

00:52:13.950 --> 00:52:18.180
towards finding that kind
of relevant competence

00:52:18.180 --> 00:52:23.680
in other people, and
also incorporating

00:52:23.680 --> 00:52:26.250
more of other
people's competence

00:52:26.250 --> 00:52:29.049
to be more relevant to you?

00:52:29.049 --> 00:52:30.840
HEIDI GRANT HALVORSON:
So the competencies,

00:52:30.840 --> 00:52:33.510
abilities, interests,
experience-- all those kind

00:52:33.510 --> 00:52:36.770
of things-- how to
connect with people more,

00:52:36.770 --> 00:52:40.370
how to find where the
overlap is maybe with yours?

00:52:40.370 --> 00:52:43.285
AUDIENCE: Yeah, find the
happy medium so that you're--

00:52:45.429 --> 00:52:47.220
HEIDI GRANT HALVORSON:
Just a couple things

00:52:47.220 --> 00:52:48.178
about that I would say.

00:52:48.178 --> 00:52:56.540
One is that often, because we
are all also bad pereceivers--

00:52:56.540 --> 00:52:58.790
so we have the problem of
being perceived incorrectly,

00:52:58.790 --> 00:53:02.180
but we also all could
maybe be better perceivers.

00:53:02.180 --> 00:53:05.280
And so very often, people
have competencies and things

00:53:05.280 --> 00:53:07.550
like that that we sort of
assume that they don't have,

00:53:07.550 --> 00:53:09.675
because we're not really
asking a lot of questions.

00:53:09.675 --> 00:53:12.170
And by the way, it's
sort of a win-win,

00:53:12.170 --> 00:53:14.810
because if you have more
curiosity toward other people

00:53:14.810 --> 00:53:17.060
and you ask them more
questions, not only

00:53:17.060 --> 00:53:19.170
do you get to find
out all the stuff,

00:53:19.170 --> 00:53:21.990
but it's also a great
way to show warmth.

00:53:21.990 --> 00:53:23.370
Being curious is wonderful.

00:53:23.370 --> 00:53:25.110
People love being
asked about themselves.

00:53:25.110 --> 00:53:26.316
It's like the best thing.

00:53:26.316 --> 00:53:28.690
And people think you're smart
when you ask them questions

00:53:28.690 --> 00:53:29.398
about themselves.

00:53:29.398 --> 00:53:30.400
It's awesome.

00:53:30.400 --> 00:53:33.110
So ask, I would
say, more questions,

00:53:33.110 --> 00:53:36.290
because sometimes you might be
just assuming that something

00:53:36.290 --> 00:53:38.870
isn't there that actually is.

00:53:38.870 --> 00:53:40.790
And then the other thing
is a little bit more

00:53:40.790 --> 00:53:45.712
of a growth mindset kind
of idea, where right now I

00:53:45.712 --> 00:53:47.170
don't necessarily
understand what's

00:53:47.170 --> 00:53:49.280
interesting about this
person's competencies.

00:53:49.280 --> 00:53:50.745
I don't get why they do it.

00:53:50.745 --> 00:53:52.370
But maybe if I ask
a bunch of questions

00:53:52.370 --> 00:53:54.780
about why-- why do you
find this interesting?

00:53:54.780 --> 00:53:57.410
Why do you see it-- why have you
done the things you're doing?

00:53:57.410 --> 00:53:59.326
Maybe I'll learn some
stuff, or maybe there'll

00:53:59.326 --> 00:54:00.710
be a connection there.

00:54:00.710 --> 00:54:03.330
Maybe there's a parallel that
I haven't really picked up on.

00:54:03.330 --> 00:54:06.060
So I think if you're kind of
a little bit more open-minded

00:54:06.060 --> 00:54:09.160
and also do a lot
more questioning,

00:54:09.160 --> 00:54:11.510
there's usually more
there than meets the eye,

00:54:11.510 --> 00:54:13.760
especially if it's somebody
who happens to just not be

00:54:13.760 --> 00:54:14.740
very forthcoming.

00:54:14.740 --> 00:54:16.840
A lot of people
are kind of closed,

00:54:16.840 --> 00:54:19.620
and they're not comfortable
with a lot of disclosure

00:54:19.620 --> 00:54:20.620
and they don't say much.

00:54:20.620 --> 00:54:22.800
But there's really a lot
going on if you probe.

00:54:22.800 --> 00:54:25.550
And people, generally
speaking, like

00:54:25.550 --> 00:54:27.250
to be asked questions
about themselves.

00:54:27.250 --> 00:54:30.359
So it's usually welcome
when you do that.

00:54:30.359 --> 00:54:30.900
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:54:30.900 --> 00:54:34.180
But I think the trouble
comes from where

00:54:34.180 --> 00:54:35.877
to start with those questions.

00:54:35.877 --> 00:54:37.460
HEIDI GRANT HALVORSON:
Start anywhere.

00:54:37.460 --> 00:54:39.060
I don't think there's
good advice for that.

00:54:39.060 --> 00:54:41.226
I mean, I think you can
start with the common ground

00:54:41.226 --> 00:54:43.470
that you share, which
is often the easiest

00:54:43.470 --> 00:54:46.680
way to have a conversation, with
whatever you do know that you

00:54:46.680 --> 00:54:49.410
even have in common, even if
it's superficial commonalities,

00:54:49.410 --> 00:54:51.650
and then kind of dig
in deeper from there,

00:54:51.650 --> 00:54:54.000
even asking questions
about why someone

00:54:54.000 --> 00:54:56.706
made the choice they did or why
did you find that interesting.

00:54:56.706 --> 00:54:58.080
The sort of
perspective questions

00:54:58.080 --> 00:55:01.030
can open up a whole
bunch of possibilities.

00:55:01.030 --> 00:55:03.200
There's no wrong way
to do it, I think.

00:55:03.200 --> 00:55:04.770
AUDIENCE: It just
feels like there's

00:55:04.770 --> 00:55:06.990
a huge gap between
superficialities

00:55:06.990 --> 00:55:08.229
and below the surface.

00:55:08.229 --> 00:55:10.770
HEIDI GRANT HALVORSON: You do,
you have to work to get there.

00:55:10.770 --> 00:55:12.800
The first questions are
always sort of almost

00:55:12.800 --> 00:55:14.140
by definition
superficial, because it's

00:55:14.140 --> 00:55:15.070
almost weird to not.

00:55:15.070 --> 00:55:17.960
It'd be almost weird to
dive into some really deep,

00:55:17.960 --> 00:55:19.900
how do you think your
childhood impacted you?

00:55:19.900 --> 00:55:20.566
That'd be weird.

00:55:20.566 --> 00:55:23.760
And so you have to kind
of approach it gradually

00:55:23.760 --> 00:55:26.530
with things that may
seem like small talk.

00:55:26.530 --> 00:55:29.150
I don't love small
talk either, but a lot

00:55:29.150 --> 00:55:31.730
of times the entryway into a
conversation or a friendship

00:55:31.730 --> 00:55:34.735
is small talk that
becomes deeper talk as you

00:55:34.735 --> 00:55:36.110
realize that you
have more things

00:55:36.110 --> 00:55:38.514
in common or more perspectives.

00:55:38.514 --> 00:55:40.430
There's interesting
research on the difference

00:55:40.430 --> 00:55:43.090
between what's called
i-sharing and me-sharing.

00:55:43.090 --> 00:55:46.610
So me sharing is when we
share things with one another.

00:55:46.610 --> 00:55:49.670
We recognize that we have things
in common with another person

00:55:49.670 --> 00:55:54.250
that are just
traits or, oh, we're

00:55:54.250 --> 00:55:56.930
both from Des Moines, Iowa,
or oh, we both like computers.

00:55:56.930 --> 00:55:58.860
Oh, we both do x.

00:55:58.860 --> 00:56:01.040
But I-sharing is
perspective sharing.

00:56:01.040 --> 00:56:03.750
So it's like, oh, I've
had the experience

00:56:03.750 --> 00:56:06.564
of looking at a
sunset in New York,

00:56:06.564 --> 00:56:07.980
and I just thought
it was amazing.

00:56:07.980 --> 00:56:09.730
Oh, I've had that
experience, too.

00:56:09.730 --> 00:56:12.145
So I sharing is that
experience sharing,

00:56:12.145 --> 00:56:14.020
where we realize we have
the same perspective

00:56:14.020 --> 00:56:15.530
as another person on something.

00:56:15.530 --> 00:56:18.770
That actually is
the most rewarding

00:56:18.770 --> 00:56:21.970
and creates the deepest
connections between people.

00:56:21.970 --> 00:56:25.000
But a lot of times, conversation
starts out as me-sharing.

00:56:25.000 --> 00:56:27.850
It starts out as,
what do you do?

00:56:27.850 --> 00:56:28.730
Here's what I do.

00:56:28.730 --> 00:56:29.540
Here's where I've lived.

00:56:29.540 --> 00:56:30.350
Here's where you lived.

00:56:30.350 --> 00:56:31.308
Oh, do you like soccer?

00:56:31.308 --> 00:56:32.500
I like soccer, too.

00:56:32.500 --> 00:56:34.320
And then it becomes
conversations

00:56:34.320 --> 00:56:36.405
about deeper things.

00:56:36.405 --> 00:56:38.530
But you kind of have to
get through that first part

00:56:38.530 --> 00:56:40.249
to even know what
kinds of experiences

00:56:40.249 --> 00:56:41.290
you might have in common.

00:56:41.290 --> 00:56:46.050
So it takes patience,
and a lot of fishing.

00:56:46.050 --> 00:56:47.404
OK, great.

00:56:47.404 --> 00:56:48.320
Thank you all so much.

00:56:48.320 --> 00:56:49.070
Thanks for coming.

00:56:49.070 --> 00:56:50.440
