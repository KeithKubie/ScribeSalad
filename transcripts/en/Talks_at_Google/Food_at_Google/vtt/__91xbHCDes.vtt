00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.488
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:01.488 --> 00:00:02.976
NATASHA CASE: Thank you guys.

00:00:05.664 --> 00:00:07.580
First of all, thank you
so much for having us.

00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:09.240
This is really
cool and exciting.

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:11.130
We've been looking
forward to it.

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:13.410
We're big fans of Google.

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:15.842
We use your business platform
in many different ways

00:00:15.842 --> 00:00:16.550
since we started.

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:17.716
FREYA ESTRELLER: Google Ads.

00:00:17.716 --> 00:00:19.030
NATASHA CASE: Yeah.

00:00:19.030 --> 00:00:20.720
The calendar, Ads,
Drive, everything.

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:23.910
So we're glad to be
able to pay it forward.

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:26.430
And just want to ask how many
of you already know Coolhaus,

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:28.520
have heard of us,
have tried the trucks.

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:29.020
Awesome.

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:29.290
FREYA ESTRELLER: Not bad.

00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:29.920
NATASHA CASE: You
should be ashamed

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:32.700
if you didn't raise your
hands, but we'll forgive you.

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:33.640
So, I'm Natasha.

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:34.357
This is Freya.

00:00:34.357 --> 00:00:35.190
FREYA ESTRELLER: Hi.

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:37.106
NATASHA CASE: We're here,
we have our cookbook

00:00:37.106 --> 00:00:40.160
which just came out in May which
we're really excited about.

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:41.310
100 recipes.

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:44.080
Ice cream cookies,
toppings, other things.

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:48.390
A lot of architecture
background on the punny names

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:50.070
with the flavors
because at Coolhaus,

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:51.720
we're architecture-inspired.

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:53.330
I used to be an architect.

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:55.835
So they have funny
names like Mintimalism,

00:00:55.835 --> 00:00:58.410
which we're actually going
to make for you today.

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:03.580
Mies Vanilla Rohe Frank Berry,
which as I'm sure most of you

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:06.490
know, you're in a Frank
Gehry Binoculars building,

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:09.520
so it's particularly apropos
to be talking about ice cream

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:10.807
and architecture here.

00:01:10.807 --> 00:01:12.390
And also there's a
lot about our story

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:13.889
in the book about
how we got started

00:01:13.889 --> 00:01:15.470
and how we grew the business.

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:18.120
So I hope you enjoy the book.

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:21.731
And we wanted to
kind of basically

00:01:21.731 --> 00:01:23.730
show you how to make one
of our favorite recipes

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:26.330
from the book, which is the
Dirty Mint Chip ice cream.

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:28.490
We're going to demo
that for you today.

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:31.800
One of our signature
and original flavors.

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:34.830
Which with a couple different
cookies is the Buckminster

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:37.240
Fuller, or the Mintimalism,
as I mentioned,

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:39.007
is the punny name for that one.

00:01:39.007 --> 00:01:41.340
And we're also going to give
you a little bit of history

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:42.440
on our brand.

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:44.220
How we got started,
how we're growing,

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:46.960
and where we're going
with our vision.

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:48.710
So, yeah, we can go
ahead and get started.

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:49.650
FREYA ESTRELLER: Yeah.

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:51.733
NATASHA CASE: So the first
thing we're going to do

00:01:51.733 --> 00:01:56.490
is actually jump ahead in
time a little with ice cream.

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:00.910
As far as the process of how
we are able to make ice cream.

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:02.870
We're going to time travel here.

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:05.770
Because you'll notice
in a lot of the recipes,

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:08.320
the active time is
actually quite low.

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:09.850
It's like 20, 25 minutes.

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:13.300
But ice cream does require a lot
of planning and being organized

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:16.040
over actually what can
be a several day span.

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:17.710
So what I'm going
to do first is I'm

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:19.850
going to take the base,
which I already made,

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:22.590
so this would be base
from the future for you.

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:26.750
Which consists of milk,
cream, in this case,

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:28.150
actually, which
I'll explain when

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:32.060
we're making the base for you,
light brown sugar, and egg

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:33.580
yolks.

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:36.310
So I'm going to go ahead
and get that started.

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:38.143
FREYA ESTRELLER: And
you guys can definitely

00:02:38.143 --> 00:02:39.370
follow along in the book.

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:45.470
I don't know-- I think it's
page 40 where the recipe is.

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:46.982
The Dirty Mint Chip ice cream.

00:02:46.982 --> 00:02:48.940
NATASHA CASE: Yeah, it's
towards the beginning.

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:51.315
So I'm pouring all this base
I made, I have about a quart

00:02:51.315 --> 00:02:54.920
of it, into my ice cream maker.

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:57.920
We love Cuisinart
ice cream makers.

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:59.860
This one is the
commercial grade,

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:02.850
which is a compressor
style ice cream machine.

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:08.040
But that run about $300 from
like a Williams Sonoma or Sur

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:08.540
la Table.

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:11.070
We also recommend in the book
a gel canister [INAUDIBLE]

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:12.660
which are cheaper.

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:14.220
And those run about $50.

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:16.600
You just have to
freeze a container that

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:18.874
has like anti-freeze
in it overnight.

00:03:18.874 --> 00:03:20.040
But they're very accessible.

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:21.840
If you get one of
these, you can make

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:23.420
hundreds of ice cream flavors.

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:27.850
So next is we're going to put in
our fresh chopped mint leaves.

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:30.090
We do recommend organic.

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:31.660
In this recipe,
it's really special

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:33.905
because we don't use
any mint oil or extract.

00:03:33.905 --> 00:03:36.050
It's just the leaves that
give it the mint flavor.

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:39.240
And that's going to give it
much more of a mojito or mint

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:40.335
tea-like minty feeling.

00:03:40.335 --> 00:03:41.960
As opposed to a super
sweet toothpastey

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:43.700
mint which we're not into.

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:47.250
I think you'll agree with us.

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:50.750
Next going in there
is dark brown sugar.

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:53.330
Like a third tablespoon.

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:54.925
Third tablespoon
dark brown sugar.

00:03:54.925 --> 00:03:55.800
That's when it also--

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:56.790
FREYA ESTRELLER:
Half tablespoon.

00:03:56.790 --> 00:03:56.975
NATASHA CASE: I'm sorry.

00:03:56.975 --> 00:03:57.850
Half tablespoon.

00:03:57.850 --> 00:03:59.391
That's going to play
to the more kind

00:03:59.391 --> 00:04:05.190
of earthy quality of
this particular recipe.

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:06.750
And a little bit,
I think, the salt.

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:07.120
FREYA ESTRELLER: Yes.

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:08.536
NATASHA CASE: And
then next, we're

00:04:08.536 --> 00:04:11.430
going to put a pinch of
kosher salt in there.

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:17.385
And on this machine, to really
get it to kind of the ice cream

00:04:17.385 --> 00:04:20.010
consistency where it's ready to
come out of the machine, that's

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:21.680
going to take almost an hour.

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:23.530
This machine has a handy timer.

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:25.530
So that's why we're getting
started on this now.

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:28.640
Because it's just going to
be churning and churning.

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:32.279
And basically how it
works is as it's turning,

00:04:32.279 --> 00:04:34.320
it's adding a little bit
of air to the ice cream.

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:35.450
And it's freezing it.

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:39.210
In ice cream, we
call that overrun.

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:40.720
It's the ratio of
how much base you

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:42.600
put in to how much
output you have.

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:44.310
These machines are
very low overrun.

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:46.736
Very dense, very high butter
fat, the best quality,

00:04:46.736 --> 00:04:47.860
the best tasting ice cream.

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:50.831
So that's the one that we
recommend for you guys.

00:04:50.831 --> 00:04:52.330
There's one more
step to this, which

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:53.210
we're going to do
at the very end.

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:55.000
Which is our semi-sweet
chocolate chips.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:59.380
Does anyone know why we
don't put them in right now?

00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:01.050
Any geniuses?

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:02.383
FREYA ESTRELLER: Oh, you got it.

00:05:02.383 --> 00:05:02.876
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:05:02.876 --> 00:05:03.370
NATASHA CASE: Exactly.

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:03.920
FREYA ESTRELLER: There you go.

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:04.630
Gravity.

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:05.840
NATASHA CASE: Any
heavier inclusions

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:08.089
are just going to sink right
there and not distribute.

00:05:08.089 --> 00:05:10.050
So those are going to
go in at the very end.

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:11.550
But we want our
mint leaves in there

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:13.930
so they can infuse the ice
cream as much as possible.

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:19.630
So now I'm going to jump
forward in time a little bit.

00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:22.150
And we're going to show you
how to make the actual base.

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:26.310
So this base that we're making
is essentially a custard.

00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:30.800
And, as I said, it consists
of milk, cream, sugar, and egg

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:32.156
yolks.

00:05:32.156 --> 00:05:34.030
In this case, we use
brown sugar in the base.

00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:34.780
Light brown sugar.

00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:36.710
Which, again, it's
this more earthy type.

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:39.040
Dirty Mint, as we call it.

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:40.770
In the standard
base recipe is just

00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:43.820
plain white granulated sugar.

00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:48.720
And when you are heating this
up, I'll show you the process,

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:52.050
but once it cools, you really
need about at least five hours

00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:54.940
of it cooling to be able to
run in the ice cream maker.

00:05:54.940 --> 00:05:59.830
So that's why it can be
like a two day process.

00:05:59.830 --> 00:06:02.040
Maybe you want to make
the base before and not

00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:03.450
churn it until the next day.

00:06:03.450 --> 00:06:04.840
So, again, it just
requires some planning.

00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:07.256
If you're having company over,
you want to make ice cream,

00:06:07.256 --> 00:06:09.630
make the base either that
morning or the day before.

00:06:09.630 --> 00:06:11.270
And then you can run it
perfectly the next day.

00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:13.894
FREYA ESTRELLER: And then we can
follow along also in the book.

00:06:13.894 --> 00:06:16.920
I think page 29 for
the plain custard base.

00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:17.810
NATASHA CASE: OK.

00:06:17.810 --> 00:06:20.590
So I have here my
two cups of cream.

00:06:24.104 --> 00:06:25.870
Just want to measure it out.

00:06:25.870 --> 00:06:27.585
We recommend organic
dairy, definitely.

00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:33.790
So two cups of cream going in.

00:06:36.340 --> 00:06:37.250
All right.

00:06:37.250 --> 00:06:38.870
Next is two cups of whole milk.

00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:45.780
If you're trying to prepare
for swimsuit season, which

00:06:45.780 --> 00:06:49.410
I don't know why you would be
if you're making ice cream,

00:06:49.410 --> 00:06:52.650
you can go half and
half or lighter milk.

00:06:52.650 --> 00:06:55.690
It just won't be as
delicious in texture.

00:06:55.690 --> 00:06:58.370
But you can kind of tone it
down a little bit on that.

00:07:02.740 --> 00:07:04.510
Next goes in the sugar.

00:07:04.510 --> 00:07:07.040
Freya's separating for me
about a cup and a quarter.

00:07:10.672 --> 00:07:12.630
FREYA ESTRELLER: And for
the Dirty Mint recipe,

00:07:12.630 --> 00:07:16.369
it's the light brown sugar,
not the white granulated.

00:07:16.369 --> 00:07:17.160
NATASHA CASE: Yeah.

00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:17.860
So, oh.

00:07:17.860 --> 00:07:18.130
FREYA ESTRELLER: Oh, oops.

00:07:18.130 --> 00:07:18.400
NATASHA CASE: Half.

00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:18.815
FREYA ESTRELLER: Oh.

00:07:18.815 --> 00:07:19.315
That's OK.

00:07:19.315 --> 00:07:24.270
NATASHA CASE: So you're going
to put half of that total

00:07:24.270 --> 00:07:26.362
on the burner with
the milk and cream.

00:07:26.362 --> 00:07:28.070
And that's going to
kind of come together

00:07:28.070 --> 00:07:29.800
and that's all on high heat.

00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:31.480
The other half of
the sugar is going

00:07:31.480 --> 00:07:36.040
to go separately in a
bowl with egg yolks.

00:07:36.040 --> 00:07:39.190
I separated eight egg yolks.

00:07:39.190 --> 00:07:41.750
And the egg yolks
are essentially

00:07:41.750 --> 00:07:43.220
the stabilizer in the ice cream.

00:07:43.220 --> 00:07:46.000
They are what's going to give
it the really nice rich texture.

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:49.362
If you ever have homemade
ice cream in a restaurant

00:07:49.362 --> 00:07:51.820
or when you've made it at home
and it can get kind of icey,

00:07:51.820 --> 00:07:55.740
that's essentially the dairy
separating from the ice.

00:07:55.740 --> 00:07:57.375
And the eggs help
bind that together.

00:07:59.930 --> 00:08:03.040
But the reason why we also
have half of the sugar

00:08:03.040 --> 00:08:06.740
and the egg separately is that
what we're going to do next

00:08:06.740 --> 00:08:08.500
is temper the eggs.

00:08:08.500 --> 00:08:11.837
We don't want the eggs
to heat up too quickly

00:08:11.837 --> 00:08:13.670
as the milk, cream, and
sugar is heating up.

00:08:13.670 --> 00:08:16.045
Because then you're going to
get scrambled eggs ice cream

00:08:16.045 --> 00:08:17.810
and nobody likes that.

00:08:17.810 --> 00:08:20.640
Not even we can make
scrambled eggs ice cream good.

00:08:23.400 --> 00:08:26.850
So as the cream, milk,
and sugar is heating up,

00:08:26.850 --> 00:08:28.583
once I get it to
a light boil, then

00:08:28.583 --> 00:08:30.640
I'm going to pour a
small amount of that

00:08:30.640 --> 00:08:33.268
into the egg yolks and sugar.

00:08:33.268 --> 00:08:35.559
And sort of gradually rise
the temperature of the eggs.

00:08:35.559 --> 00:08:37.159
And this will make
them not scramble.

00:08:37.159 --> 00:08:38.669
I would say that
the vast majority

00:08:38.669 --> 00:08:42.419
of the time, the people feel the
most challenging part of making

00:08:42.419 --> 00:08:43.840
ice cream is actually the base.

00:08:43.840 --> 00:08:45.590
That the most mistakes
are with this part.

00:08:45.590 --> 00:08:47.243
Once you get past
this, you're kind

00:08:47.243 --> 00:08:49.770
of in the clear with throwing
mint leaves and chocolate

00:08:49.770 --> 00:08:51.574
chips into your
ice cream machines.

00:08:51.574 --> 00:08:52.740
FREYA ESTRELLER: Or alcohol.

00:08:52.740 --> 00:08:52.940
NATASHA CASE: Yeah.

00:08:52.940 --> 00:08:54.523
FREYA ESTRELLER: Or
whatever you want.

00:08:54.523 --> 00:08:56.940
NATASHA CASE: Yeah,
feel free to spike.

00:08:56.940 --> 00:08:59.671
So yeah, I'm just going to
let this kind of heat up.

00:08:59.671 --> 00:09:01.980
FREYA ESTRELLER: Cool.

00:09:01.980 --> 00:09:05.260
So while this is
happening, we'll

00:09:05.260 --> 00:09:09.070
just give a quick overview
on how we got started.

00:09:09.070 --> 00:09:09.570
Right?

00:09:09.570 --> 00:09:14.450
How did we go from Natasha doing
seven years of architecture

00:09:14.450 --> 00:09:19.920
school to us having
Coolhaus in 2000 stores

00:09:19.920 --> 00:09:21.510
all across the country.

00:09:21.510 --> 00:09:23.230
Right?

00:09:23.230 --> 00:09:26.730
So here we are in
one of our trucks.

00:09:26.730 --> 00:09:33.270
We now have 11 in LA,
New York, Austin, Dallas.

00:09:33.270 --> 00:09:35.020
NATASHA CASE: One is
visiting later today.

00:09:35.020 --> 00:09:35.480
So.

00:09:35.480 --> 00:09:35.910
FREYA ESTRELLER: Whoo!

00:09:35.910 --> 00:09:36.410
Yeah.

00:09:36.410 --> 00:09:38.868
NATASHA CASE: We all really
know why you're here, you know?

00:09:38.868 --> 00:09:39.630
[LAUGHTER]

00:09:39.630 --> 00:09:41.546
FREYA ESTRELLER: Just
let us get through this.

00:09:41.546 --> 00:09:42.880
Yeah.

00:09:42.880 --> 00:09:46.190
NATASHA CASE: Some food
porn for you, you know?

00:09:46.190 --> 00:09:47.780
Some of our signature flavors.

00:09:47.780 --> 00:09:50.590
You know, obviously, the
product is so, so key to us.

00:09:50.590 --> 00:09:52.380
We really got
started just wanting

00:09:52.380 --> 00:09:53.690
to make things from scratch.

00:09:53.690 --> 00:09:56.430
And wanting to make a
product that we want to eat.

00:09:56.430 --> 00:09:58.870
Also wanting to be
edgy and adventurous.

00:09:58.870 --> 00:10:02.260
Freya and I both have pretty
sweet meets savory palates.

00:10:02.260 --> 00:10:04.910
So doing things like
Beer and Pretzels,

00:10:04.910 --> 00:10:06.750
or Fried Chicken
and Waffles, Brown

00:10:06.750 --> 00:10:09.140
Butter Candied Bacon ice
cream, really just wanting

00:10:09.140 --> 00:10:10.860
to push the envelope.

00:10:10.860 --> 00:10:13.130
And also bring in the
architecture connection.

00:10:13.130 --> 00:10:15.030
For me, coming out
of school, I just

00:10:15.030 --> 00:10:17.320
felt like what was missing
with what we were studying

00:10:17.320 --> 00:10:19.410
in architecture was
bridging it to the public

00:10:19.410 --> 00:10:21.510
and making it really
fun and accessible.

00:10:21.510 --> 00:10:24.790
So I had this crazy idea to
make ice cream and cookies

00:10:24.790 --> 00:10:26.980
and name the combinations
after architects.

00:10:26.980 --> 00:10:29.210
So that was also a big
part of the impetus

00:10:29.210 --> 00:10:31.540
for us is to-- we were
on this kind of mission

00:10:31.540 --> 00:10:34.290
with making
architecture digestible.

00:10:34.290 --> 00:10:36.950
So the flavor on the top
is the I. M. Peanut Butter,

00:10:36.950 --> 00:10:37.530
for example.

00:10:37.530 --> 00:10:38.770
Which is a play on I. M. Pei.

00:10:38.770 --> 00:10:40.270
Chocolate Peanut
Butter Cookie which

00:10:40.270 --> 00:10:43.490
is now sold in Whole Foods.

00:10:43.490 --> 00:10:46.550
You want to do the next?

00:10:46.550 --> 00:10:49.810
So, yeah, I mentioned the
architecture part is really,

00:10:49.810 --> 00:10:53.260
I think, a big thing that's made
Coolhaus really, really unique.

00:10:53.260 --> 00:10:56.010
I sort of explain it like
Ben and Jerry's and Rock N'

00:10:56.010 --> 00:10:58.144
Roll, or late night television.

00:10:58.144 --> 00:10:59.810
For us, it's ice cream
and architecture.

00:10:59.810 --> 00:11:02.820
It's a little more niche
than Rock N' Roll or TV,

00:11:02.820 --> 00:11:04.080
but it works.

00:11:04.080 --> 00:11:06.790
But it does give us this
whole other audience.

00:11:06.790 --> 00:11:10.810
In terms of who's aware
of Coolhaus and people

00:11:10.810 --> 00:11:13.350
really like, I think,
this other component.

00:11:13.350 --> 00:11:15.840
And we do a lot of the
design for the packaging,

00:11:15.840 --> 00:11:17.550
the website, the
store internally.

00:11:17.550 --> 00:11:19.040
I do a lot of it myself.

00:11:19.040 --> 00:11:21.165
So I think it gives the
brand a lot of authenticity

00:11:21.165 --> 00:11:22.610
with the look and feel.

00:11:22.610 --> 00:11:25.360
But a lot of famous architects
have been to Coolhaus

00:11:25.360 --> 00:11:26.090
or know about it.

00:11:26.090 --> 00:11:28.740
Here's Frank Gehry,
your very own.

00:11:28.740 --> 00:11:32.000
Who's not very tall, as
you can see, at the truck.

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:34.240
He's lactose intolerant,
it turns out too.

00:11:34.240 --> 00:11:36.455
So he couldn't eat his
flavor, which was unfortunate.

00:11:36.455 --> 00:11:38.621
FREYA ESTRELLER: He also
made a really funny comment

00:11:38.621 --> 00:11:39.400
at the truck.

00:11:39.400 --> 00:11:42.750
He was like, you guys--
and this was at his office

00:11:42.750 --> 00:11:44.860
here on the west
side-- and he was like,

00:11:44.860 --> 00:11:48.150
you guys sure are making
a lot of money off of us.

00:11:48.150 --> 00:11:53.250
And I was like, oh, no, like
off of starchitects in general?

00:11:53.250 --> 00:11:55.025
Or just his office?

00:11:55.025 --> 00:11:56.840
But we'll never know
what he meant by that.

00:11:56.840 --> 00:11:57.500
[LAUGHTER]

00:11:57.500 --> 00:11:58.680
NATASHA CASE: We still
think about it every morning

00:11:58.680 --> 00:11:59.520
when we wake up.

00:11:59.520 --> 00:12:01.480
[LAUGHTER]

00:12:01.480 --> 00:12:04.680
There's also Thom
Mayne who did Caltrans.

00:12:04.680 --> 00:12:08.550
and a lot of
international landmarks.

00:12:08.550 --> 00:12:10.780
Most recently, Emerson
College, which is beautiful.

00:12:10.780 --> 00:12:13.196
I don't know if you guys have
seen it on Sunset Boulevard.

00:12:13.196 --> 00:12:15.600
But his flavor is
the Thom Mango.

00:12:15.600 --> 00:12:18.049
So there he is with his
employees eating the sandwich.

00:12:18.049 --> 00:12:19.840
So anyway, it's just
a really fun component

00:12:19.840 --> 00:12:23.849
and I hope you enjoy that
part of the book, as well.

00:12:23.849 --> 00:12:25.640
FREYA ESTRELLER: So
this is how we started.

00:12:25.640 --> 00:12:28.260
This is what the truck
looked like when we bought it

00:12:28.260 --> 00:12:30.545
for $2,900 on Craigslist.

00:12:30.545 --> 00:12:31.980
[LAUGHTER]

00:12:31.980 --> 00:12:33.360
It didn't drive.

00:12:33.360 --> 00:12:38.024
We actually had to trick AAA
to tow it for us to Coachella.

00:12:38.024 --> 00:12:39.440
Because we figured
out that if you

00:12:39.440 --> 00:12:44.130
got the premiere membership,
you got two free 200 mile tows.

00:12:44.130 --> 00:12:45.077
So--

00:12:45.077 --> 00:12:46.660
NATASHA CASE: So
little bit of a scam.

00:12:46.660 --> 00:12:47.940
FREYA ESTRELLER: So that's
how we got it there.

00:12:47.940 --> 00:12:49.620
And those are all
of our ragtag group

00:12:49.620 --> 00:12:52.480
of friends who we bribed
with free Coachella tickets.

00:12:52.480 --> 00:12:53.365
NATASHA CASE: They're
not gang members.

00:12:53.365 --> 00:12:53.700
FREYA ESTRELLER: Yeah.

00:12:53.700 --> 00:12:54.710
NATASHA CASE: Contrary to--

00:12:54.710 --> 00:12:56.626
FREYA ESTRELLER: To help
us work that weekend.

00:12:56.626 --> 00:12:59.710
And we really went into
it not knowing very much

00:12:59.710 --> 00:13:03.880
about how to run a food company.

00:13:03.880 --> 00:13:07.380
I think we got there and then
realized we need at our booth,

00:13:07.380 --> 00:13:11.000
because we had a booth too,
all four sides of the booth

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:13.649
had to be covered for
health regulations.

00:13:13.649 --> 00:13:14.940
So we were like, what do we do?

00:13:14.940 --> 00:13:19.160
We just grabbed tarps off
other people's vehicles

00:13:19.160 --> 00:13:21.840
and started wrapping
our booth with it.

00:13:21.840 --> 00:13:24.709
So really getting
bootstrappy with it.

00:13:24.709 --> 00:13:26.000
NATASHA CASE: Quick break here.

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:30.654
This is the cream,
sugar, and milk.

00:13:30.654 --> 00:13:31.320
It's hot enough.

00:13:31.320 --> 00:13:33.580
It's at like a kind
of soft boil that I'm

00:13:33.580 --> 00:13:35.150
going to pour
about a third of it

00:13:35.150 --> 00:13:39.120
into my egg yolks and
light brown sugar.

00:13:39.120 --> 00:13:45.170
Again, tempering the eggs
and stirring that gently.

00:13:45.170 --> 00:13:47.550
Basically, you don't want to
cause like a major chemical

00:13:47.550 --> 00:13:49.216
equation happening
with these egg yolks.

00:13:49.216 --> 00:13:49.860
No scrambling.

00:13:53.040 --> 00:13:55.460
So once I've got a nice
kind of pale yellow

00:13:55.460 --> 00:13:57.220
and that's a little hard to see.

00:13:57.220 --> 00:13:58.930
That's going to go
back into the pot.

00:13:58.930 --> 00:14:00.490
And you can, can you just
turn it off basically.

00:14:00.490 --> 00:14:01.830
FREYA ESTRELLER: Yeah,
I turned it to 170.

00:14:01.830 --> 00:14:02.280
NATASHA CASE: And
then you're going

00:14:02.280 --> 00:14:04.980
to turn that pot onto
low so that it's now

00:14:04.980 --> 00:14:08.620
really just all kind
of coming together,

00:14:08.620 --> 00:14:11.495
but not on like a
high boil anymore.

00:14:11.495 --> 00:14:12.870
FREYA ESTRELLER:
Yeah, so we want

00:14:12.870 --> 00:14:19.280
to get it to between 165 and 180
which just thickens it enough.

00:14:19.280 --> 00:14:20.320
NATASHA CASE: Yeah.

00:14:20.320 --> 00:14:22.130
And pretty much all
that's left here

00:14:22.130 --> 00:14:25.320
is just seeing that
it gets to that point.

00:14:25.320 --> 00:14:27.820
And then you're going to take
it off the heat, let it chill,

00:14:27.820 --> 00:14:29.770
and then it's going
to go into the fridge.

00:14:29.770 --> 00:14:31.630
Really, minimum five
hours in the fridge.

00:14:31.630 --> 00:14:34.500
But, again, overnight
would be ideal too.

00:14:34.500 --> 00:14:36.127
And I also recommend
that you-- we're

00:14:36.127 --> 00:14:37.210
pretty much there already.

00:14:37.210 --> 00:14:39.017
At 170.

00:14:39.017 --> 00:14:40.600
So you can go ahead
and turn this off.

00:14:40.600 --> 00:14:44.700
I recommend that you, you know,
you can make the base in bulk.

00:14:44.700 --> 00:14:47.120
So that you can use base for
multiple ice cream flavors.

00:14:47.120 --> 00:14:48.810
So you could pick out like
two or three from the book

00:14:48.810 --> 00:14:49.790
that you want to make.

00:14:49.790 --> 00:14:52.910
80% of the recipes for the
ice cream use the same base.

00:14:52.910 --> 00:14:54.929
So don't feel like
you have to make base

00:14:54.929 --> 00:14:56.470
every time you want
to make a flavor.

00:14:56.470 --> 00:14:59.040
You have three to five
days to use the base.

00:14:59.040 --> 00:15:00.920
So, you know, again,
if you're smart

00:15:00.920 --> 00:15:03.300
about it, just a
little bit of planning,

00:15:03.300 --> 00:15:06.060
you can really make
it work and not

00:15:06.060 --> 00:15:08.374
actually spend that much
time making ice cream.

00:15:08.374 --> 00:15:10.980
FREYA ESTRELLER: Yeah.

00:15:10.980 --> 00:15:13.510
There's another shot
of the truck and kind

00:15:13.510 --> 00:15:17.610
of like the spirit, and culture,
and vibe of our company.

00:15:17.610 --> 00:15:20.420
And, of course, because we had
all those stickers on there,

00:15:20.420 --> 00:15:24.060
people were asking us for
Bomb Pops and Choco Tacos,

00:15:24.060 --> 00:15:26.970
and we were like, no, we
have architecturally themed,

00:15:26.970 --> 00:15:28.650
all natural, gourmet ice cream.

00:15:28.650 --> 00:15:29.940
[LAUGHTER]

00:15:29.940 --> 00:15:32.859
So we're glad it resonated.

00:15:32.859 --> 00:15:33.900
Obviously, learned a lot.

00:15:33.900 --> 00:15:34.775
There was no signage.

00:15:34.775 --> 00:15:35.795
No one knew who we were.

00:15:39.350 --> 00:15:43.370
NATASHA CASE: So then we scraped
together the mild earnings

00:15:43.370 --> 00:15:46.370
from Coachella and
it was time to fix up

00:15:46.370 --> 00:15:50.920
the truck and brand it to
be Coolhaus and whatnot.

00:15:50.920 --> 00:15:53.990
So we sent it to
east LA where a guy

00:15:53.990 --> 00:15:58.240
named Junior, who was known in
the ice cream truck community

00:15:58.240 --> 00:16:00.970
as being the person who
could sort of fix up

00:16:00.970 --> 00:16:04.410
the aesthetics a little and
do some of the interior.

00:16:04.410 --> 00:16:08.170
The truck lived over at his
shop for a couple weeks.

00:16:08.170 --> 00:16:10.465
And by upgrade the
truck, basically we

00:16:10.465 --> 00:16:14.880
mean add a door on it,
and an operable window,

00:16:14.880 --> 00:16:16.160
and paint it silver.

00:16:16.160 --> 00:16:18.690
And then actually our logo was
supposed to be done in vinyl.

00:16:18.690 --> 00:16:21.070
You know, vector files that
said Coolhaus on the back.

00:16:21.070 --> 00:16:23.600
It turned out, someone
just handpainted the logo.

00:16:23.600 --> 00:16:26.140
So that, I guess, was a
little miscommunication.

00:16:26.140 --> 00:16:28.040
But we felt that it
gave it a cool kind

00:16:28.040 --> 00:16:29.510
of authentic feel anyway.

00:16:29.510 --> 00:16:32.269
So we were able to hit
the streets with the truck

00:16:32.269 --> 00:16:33.810
and start to get
the brand out there.

00:16:37.320 --> 00:16:39.830
FREYA ESTRELLER:
And then in 2009,

00:16:39.830 --> 00:16:46.160
end of 2009, because
he started April, 2009.

00:16:46.160 --> 00:16:50.480
For those eight months, we
actually operated illegally.

00:16:50.480 --> 00:16:52.200
Because when we
bought the truck,

00:16:52.200 --> 00:16:55.760
we didn't realize that we
needed a bigger truck like that

00:16:55.760 --> 00:16:58.470
to have the permit to do
made-to-order ice cream

00:16:58.470 --> 00:16:59.320
sandwiches.

00:16:59.320 --> 00:17:00.870
NATASHA CASE: And we
needed four sinks in there.

00:17:00.870 --> 00:17:01.470
FREYA ESTRELLER: Yeah,
we needed four sinks.

00:17:01.470 --> 00:17:02.900
We only had one sink.

00:17:02.900 --> 00:17:06.920
So we had a permit for
prepackaged ice cream.

00:17:06.920 --> 00:17:09.599
And we were like, oh,
whatever, screw it.

00:17:09.599 --> 00:17:10.950
We'll go out there anyway.

00:17:10.950 --> 00:17:13.440
And thankfully, in
that eight months,

00:17:13.440 --> 00:17:17.760
we were able to build our name,
get press, build a reputation.

00:17:17.760 --> 00:17:19.760
And then we got caught
by the health department.

00:17:19.760 --> 00:17:21.551
NATASHA CASE: Then we
were at First Friday.

00:17:21.551 --> 00:17:23.959
And even then, even with
the incorrect permit

00:17:23.959 --> 00:17:25.500
for what we were
doing, we were still

00:17:25.500 --> 00:17:27.300
kind of chummy with
the health department.

00:17:27.300 --> 00:17:29.102
And we were at First Friday.

00:17:29.102 --> 00:17:30.560
And I actually
wasn't on the truck.

00:17:30.560 --> 00:17:33.430
We had some of our employees,
AKA friends, on the truck.

00:17:33.430 --> 00:17:36.331
And the health inspector
called me and said,

00:17:36.331 --> 00:17:37.830
your guys are
scooping on the truck.

00:17:37.830 --> 00:17:39.413
It's only supposed
to be pre-packaged.

00:17:39.413 --> 00:17:41.399
And I was like,
are you kidding me?

00:17:41.399 --> 00:17:43.440
I told them so many times
not to scoop ice cream.

00:17:43.440 --> 00:17:44.490
How could they have done that?

00:17:44.490 --> 00:17:44.830
[LAUGHTER]

00:17:44.830 --> 00:17:46.779
They should only be
handing out pre-packaged.

00:17:46.779 --> 00:17:48.070
I will definitely talk to them.

00:17:48.070 --> 00:17:50.403
He was like, OK, just make
sure it doesn't happen again.

00:17:50.403 --> 00:17:53.145
Fast forward a couple weeks,
I'm on the truck scooping ice

00:17:53.145 --> 00:17:53.645
cream.

00:17:53.645 --> 00:17:54.145
[LAUGHTER]

00:17:54.145 --> 00:18:00.490
And they come up in their car
and totally caught red-handed.

00:18:00.490 --> 00:18:02.310
I had a huge line,
but they didn't care.

00:18:02.310 --> 00:18:05.100
They poured bleach in all
the tubs of ice cream.

00:18:05.100 --> 00:18:08.780
And it was just a really sad,
humiliating day for Coolhaus.

00:18:08.780 --> 00:18:12.180
And essentially, all said
and done, we worked it out

00:18:12.180 --> 00:18:15.890
and they said, look, if you
want to be able to continue,

00:18:15.890 --> 00:18:17.984
you have to get a
more functional--

00:18:17.984 --> 00:18:19.900
FREYA ESTRELLER: And you
got put on probation.

00:18:19.900 --> 00:18:20.120
NATASHA CASE: Yeah.

00:18:20.120 --> 00:18:20.930
FREYA ESTRELLER: For
a couple of years.

00:18:20.930 --> 00:18:21.487
[LAUGHTER]

00:18:21.487 --> 00:18:23.320
NATASHA CASE: Yeah, it
was the case of Case.

00:18:23.320 --> 00:18:25.030
That's my last name, Case.

00:18:25.030 --> 00:18:28.710
And it ended up being just
kind of a-- we worked it out

00:18:28.710 --> 00:18:29.590
in the end.

00:18:29.590 --> 00:18:34.590
Actually, the public defense
that they assigned to me,

00:18:34.590 --> 00:18:37.622
while the judge was reading
all the that we didn't have

00:18:37.622 --> 00:18:39.830
the right sinks on the truck,
and all the violations,

00:18:39.830 --> 00:18:41.570
she whispered into me
and she was like, so,

00:18:41.570 --> 00:18:42.240
ice cream sandwiches, huh?

00:18:42.240 --> 00:18:42.948
And I said, yeah.

00:18:42.948 --> 00:18:44.470
And she said, how much are they?

00:18:44.470 --> 00:18:45.194
I said, $5 each.

00:18:45.194 --> 00:18:46.610
She said, do you
do kid's parties?

00:18:46.610 --> 00:18:47.820
I was like, yeah,
here's my card.

00:18:47.820 --> 00:18:48.319
[LAUGHTER]

00:18:48.319 --> 00:18:50.532
That's how I knew we
were going to be OK.

00:18:50.532 --> 00:18:52.490
FREYA ESTRELLER: That
forced us to really think

00:18:52.490 --> 00:18:54.480
about the business
and also think

00:18:54.480 --> 00:18:57.230
about how we were going
to grow it strategically.

00:18:57.230 --> 00:18:59.370
And we knew that if we
wanted to get off the truck,

00:18:59.370 --> 00:19:02.150
we needed multiple trucks
and multiple revenue streams.

00:19:02.150 --> 00:19:04.310
So that we could
still pay ourselves

00:19:04.310 --> 00:19:07.796
a salary without being
on the truck every day.

00:19:07.796 --> 00:19:09.170
So we're glad that
that happened.

00:19:09.170 --> 00:19:11.820
We raised-- you know, we did
a friends and family round.

00:19:11.820 --> 00:19:14.970
Raised $30,000 from
friends and family.

00:19:14.970 --> 00:19:16.830
Took on a hard money loan.

00:19:16.830 --> 00:19:20.660
Because no one is going to be
loaning money to a business

00:19:20.660 --> 00:19:23.310
that hasn't been in business
for more than two years.

00:19:23.310 --> 00:19:25.725
I think the interest
rate was like 22%.

00:19:25.725 --> 00:19:28.530
It was kind of crazy, but we
had to do what we had to do.

00:19:28.530 --> 00:19:30.737
So that's actually
our second truck.

00:19:30.737 --> 00:19:33.070
NATASHA CASE: Again, in front
of a Frank Gehry landmark.

00:19:33.070 --> 00:19:34.034
FREYA ESTRELLER: Yeah.

00:19:34.034 --> 00:19:36.200
NATASHA CASE: So not only
were we starting to scale,

00:19:36.200 --> 00:19:38.408
but we were really starting
to specialize and develop

00:19:38.408 --> 00:19:39.730
our niches for the brand.

00:19:39.730 --> 00:19:42.500
Something that we didn't really
plan for in the beginning that

00:19:42.500 --> 00:19:44.250
ended up being a huge
part of our business

00:19:44.250 --> 00:19:45.650
was private catering.

00:19:45.650 --> 00:19:48.870
And particularly in that
niche, actually, weddings

00:19:48.870 --> 00:19:50.390
is our number one type of event.

00:19:50.390 --> 00:19:52.850
We've done over 1,000 weddings.

00:19:52.850 --> 00:19:55.240
They ended up being, I
think, a really good match

00:19:55.240 --> 00:19:57.690
because of the customization
component of Coolhaus.

00:19:57.690 --> 00:20:00.855
You know, pick your cookie,
pick your ice cream.

00:20:00.855 --> 00:20:03.230
Everyone feels like they're
making their own unique treat

00:20:03.230 --> 00:20:03.930
by doing that.

00:20:03.930 --> 00:20:07.360
And part of the kind of
architectural thinking

00:20:07.360 --> 00:20:09.310
with the product is
I wanted to rethink

00:20:09.310 --> 00:20:12.370
the envelope with which
the sandwich is delivered.

00:20:12.370 --> 00:20:14.480
And that's obviously
the packaging.

00:20:14.480 --> 00:20:17.390
So came up with this idea
of the edible wrapper.

00:20:17.390 --> 00:20:20.300
And there's kind of two points
that the edible wrapper brings

00:20:20.300 --> 00:20:22.110
that are really,
really, I think,

00:20:22.110 --> 00:20:25.100
exciting for
customers and clients.

00:20:25.100 --> 00:20:27.250
One is the sustainability side.

00:20:27.250 --> 00:20:30.960
If you're eating an ice cream
sandwich on the sidewalk

00:20:30.960 --> 00:20:35.270
and you want to keep kind of a
clean environment, when you're

00:20:35.270 --> 00:20:37.010
done eating the ice
cream sandwiches,

00:20:37.010 --> 00:20:40.160
the edible wrapper essentially
sops up all the drippings.

00:20:40.160 --> 00:20:42.660
And then you can just pop it
in your mouth and it dissolves.

00:20:42.660 --> 00:20:44.201
And I also feel like
it's really hard

00:20:44.201 --> 00:20:45.720
to find trash cans
in LA in general,

00:20:45.720 --> 00:20:47.720
so that's just my pet peeve.

00:20:47.720 --> 00:20:49.090
So it's a no waste product.

00:20:49.090 --> 00:20:52.690
The other side is that we can
print on it with edible ink.

00:20:52.690 --> 00:20:53.820
Soy-based ink.

00:20:53.820 --> 00:20:55.890
So it's great for
corporate activations.

00:20:55.890 --> 00:20:58.980
We should've put, we've done
a lot of Google activations

00:20:58.980 --> 00:21:01.460
where we've had Google
Wallet on the edible wrapper.

00:21:01.460 --> 00:21:05.231
Or when it was the operating
system ice cream sandwich,

00:21:05.231 --> 00:21:07.230
I would have been offended
if we weren't invited

00:21:07.230 --> 00:21:10.040
to come to Google and do
something special for that.

00:21:10.040 --> 00:21:12.510
So we did a special
Android ice cream sandwich

00:21:12.510 --> 00:21:13.780
on the edible wrapper.

00:21:13.780 --> 00:21:16.060
But anyway, for weddings,
obviously, people

00:21:16.060 --> 00:21:17.750
like to have that
customization side

00:21:17.750 --> 00:21:20.160
and put their
monogram on something.

00:21:20.160 --> 00:21:21.834
The edible wrapper
is perfect for that.

00:21:21.834 --> 00:21:23.250
We have a lot of
brides and grooms

00:21:23.250 --> 00:21:25.044
also, they want us
to print their faces

00:21:25.044 --> 00:21:25.960
on the edible wrapper.

00:21:25.960 --> 00:21:28.501
Which is sort of weird because
then you're eating their faces

00:21:28.501 --> 00:21:30.520
or throwing away their faces.

00:21:30.520 --> 00:21:34.370
But anyway, it's a really fun
kind of component of the brand.

00:21:34.370 --> 00:21:36.650
FREYA ESTRELLER: And
then finally, we actually

00:21:36.650 --> 00:21:40.850
did another, or I guess our
first angel investment round.

00:21:40.850 --> 00:21:43.560
Because we wanted to
open up a storefront.

00:21:43.560 --> 00:21:46.500
At that point, we
had a couple trucks.

00:21:46.500 --> 00:21:50.000
We were looking to expand into
New York City with a couple

00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:51.050
trucks.

00:21:51.050 --> 00:21:53.920
And that's our Culver City
storefront right there.

00:21:53.920 --> 00:21:57.340
And, of course, with all
startups and businesses,

00:21:57.340 --> 00:22:01.520
you come across a lot
of bumps in the road.

00:22:01.520 --> 00:22:05.400
It didn't work out with
our first angel investor.

00:22:05.400 --> 00:22:08.030
As we started progressing
forward with him,

00:22:08.030 --> 00:22:10.770
we realized it
wasn't a good fit.

00:22:10.770 --> 00:22:13.080
And thankfully our lawyer
had wrote something

00:22:13.080 --> 00:22:15.910
in the agreement that if we
didn't take all the money

00:22:15.910 --> 00:22:20.410
by a certain amount of time, the
equity converted back to debt.

00:22:20.410 --> 00:22:21.480
Which was awesome.

00:22:21.480 --> 00:22:26.140
So we got to keep our
equity, no longer work

00:22:26.140 --> 00:22:30.270
with that angel investor, now
it just turned into a loan.

00:22:30.270 --> 00:22:33.392
And then, while we were under
construction in Culver City--

00:22:33.392 --> 00:22:34.850
so it was kind of
a stressful time.

00:22:34.850 --> 00:22:40.380
We had to stop construction,
we came across Bobby Margolis,

00:22:40.380 --> 00:22:44.220
who was Natasha's dad's client.

00:22:44.220 --> 00:22:45.980
Natasha's dad is
also an architect.

00:22:45.980 --> 00:22:48.720
And Bobby used to
own Cherokee jeans.

00:22:48.720 --> 00:22:54.662
And he was looking to invest
in a cool startup brand.

00:22:54.662 --> 00:22:56.870
NATASHA CASE: And he was
particularly interested in--

00:22:56.870 --> 00:22:59.141
we had just gone into
a few Whole Foods

00:22:59.141 --> 00:23:00.390
when we were connected to him.

00:23:00.390 --> 00:23:04.400
I did a three store test in
Venice, Glendale, and Pasadena.

00:23:04.400 --> 00:23:05.610
It was doing really well.

00:23:05.610 --> 00:23:07.359
So we were already
starting to grow there.

00:23:07.359 --> 00:23:09.200
For us, at the time,
we just thought,

00:23:09.200 --> 00:23:10.757
the Whole Food
accounts were good,

00:23:10.757 --> 00:23:12.090
but they were slightly annoying.

00:23:12.090 --> 00:23:15.480
We had to meet all
their criteria,

00:23:15.480 --> 00:23:16.950
and do all these
deliveries, and it

00:23:16.950 --> 00:23:19.560
seemed like a really small,
nothing side of the business.

00:23:19.560 --> 00:23:21.150
However, he really
saw the potentially

00:23:21.150 --> 00:23:21.985
and the scalability.

00:23:21.985 --> 00:23:23.526
FREYA ESTRELLER:
Yeah, we came to him

00:23:23.526 --> 00:23:26.910
with financial projections for
two trucks in every major city.

00:23:26.910 --> 00:23:31.430
We were like, Chicago,
Miami, St. Louis, Atlanta.

00:23:31.430 --> 00:23:33.730
And he was like, no, ladies.

00:23:33.730 --> 00:23:35.010
No, no, no.

00:23:35.010 --> 00:23:38.200
We're going to become
the next Ben and Jerry's.

00:23:38.200 --> 00:23:39.730
Are you guys ready for that?

00:23:39.730 --> 00:23:43.780
Like we're going to go to
Whole Foods, Sprouts, Bristol

00:23:43.780 --> 00:23:45.820
Farms, [INAUDIBLE], et
cetera, and we were like,

00:23:45.820 --> 00:23:47.420
but this is so annoying.

00:23:47.420 --> 00:23:51.010
Like putting it
together and everything.

00:23:51.010 --> 00:23:55.030
But fast forward a couple years
later and that is definitely

00:23:55.030 --> 00:23:58.140
our goal is to be the
next Ben and Jerry's.

00:24:00.649 --> 00:24:02.565
There's some of our--
that's a happy employee.

00:24:02.565 --> 00:24:03.470
[LAUGHTER]

00:24:03.470 --> 00:24:05.391
NATASHA CASE: Well, to
the point with the-- we

00:24:05.391 --> 00:24:07.390
like having the different
sides of the business.

00:24:07.390 --> 00:24:09.850
At this point, the
trucks are the marketing

00:24:09.850 --> 00:24:14.420
and on the ground, boutique
side of the brands.

00:24:14.420 --> 00:24:17.000
The stores are great
for sort of showcasing

00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:19.874
the whole vision of what we're
about and the company culture.

00:24:19.874 --> 00:24:22.040
It's a place where everyone
can sort of see and know

00:24:22.040 --> 00:24:22.590
each other.

00:24:22.590 --> 00:24:25.454
We have our storage there,
our office headquarters,

00:24:25.454 --> 00:24:27.120
and the trucks load
in and out of there.

00:24:27.120 --> 00:24:29.320
So it created just
like a centralized hub

00:24:29.320 --> 00:24:30.677
for Coolhaus company culture.

00:24:30.677 --> 00:24:32.510
And I feel like that's
when the brand really

00:24:32.510 --> 00:24:33.800
matured to the next level.

00:24:33.800 --> 00:24:37.430
We do now have 70
employees nationwide.

00:24:37.430 --> 00:24:39.455
And they all hold their
hands a bit in the air

00:24:39.455 --> 00:24:42.230
and look excited all the time.

00:24:42.230 --> 00:24:45.882
We do also have another store
in Pasadena in Old Town.

00:24:45.882 --> 00:24:47.340
It's actually a
shared marketplace,

00:24:47.340 --> 00:24:49.330
it's a very cool
space on Colorado.

00:24:49.330 --> 00:24:51.500
I highly recommend
you guys check it out.

00:24:51.500 --> 00:24:53.410
Piehole is in there, Pressed.

00:24:53.410 --> 00:24:57.865
There's a flower company
coming in, a spice company.

00:24:57.865 --> 00:25:00.240
So that's been good to have
on two different sides of LA.

00:25:00.240 --> 00:25:03.330
Different brick
and mortar retail.

00:25:03.330 --> 00:25:06.160
FREYA ESTRELLER: And with this,
with the design we worked with,

00:25:06.160 --> 00:25:09.125
I don't know if you guys have
heard of the Design, bitches?

00:25:09.125 --> 00:25:10.666
NATASHA CASE: Design,
comma, bitches.

00:25:10.666 --> 00:25:11.010
FREYA ESTRELLER: Comma.

00:25:11.010 --> 00:25:11.380
Yeah.

00:25:11.380 --> 00:25:13.338
NATASHA CASE: Like we're
the bitches, not them.

00:25:13.338 --> 00:25:14.560
[LAUGHTER]

00:25:14.560 --> 00:25:16.220
But they did our
Culver City store,

00:25:16.220 --> 00:25:19.620
they did Superba, both
Superbas, Oinkster.

00:25:19.620 --> 00:25:21.290
They're very cool.

00:25:21.290 --> 00:25:24.930
Majorly up and coming
architecture firm.

00:25:24.930 --> 00:25:27.740
Two ladies that
we're friendly with.

00:25:27.740 --> 00:25:30.539
So this just sort of maps
out some of the growth.

00:25:30.539 --> 00:25:32.080
We are pretty
ambitious and Coolhaus.

00:25:32.080 --> 00:25:34.190
We've doubled or
tripled every year

00:25:34.190 --> 00:25:36.800
in terms of our
reach and revenue.

00:25:36.800 --> 00:25:38.990
But you can see how at
the beginning, trucks

00:25:38.990 --> 00:25:41.510
and scaling the trucks,
then diversifying more

00:25:41.510 --> 00:25:43.730
with brick and mortar and
wholesale distribution.

00:25:43.730 --> 00:25:45.790
Then really focusing on
wholesale distribution

00:25:45.790 --> 00:25:49.050
and diversifying that.

00:25:49.050 --> 00:25:50.770
I think the later
slides will show

00:25:50.770 --> 00:25:54.410
we kind of fine
tuned our packaging.

00:25:54.410 --> 00:25:58.040
Yeah, we started with
that box in the lower left

00:25:58.040 --> 00:26:00.000
which was really hard
to read from the shelf.

00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:02.170
And all the flavors just
had a black and white label

00:26:02.170 --> 00:26:03.880
saying what each
different flavor was.

00:26:03.880 --> 00:26:06.505
So you literally couldn't tell--
like, we couldn't have made it

00:26:06.505 --> 00:26:08.280
harder for people
to know what it was

00:26:08.280 --> 00:26:09.780
and what the different
flavors were.

00:26:09.780 --> 00:26:13.049
But we still made it
past that initial test

00:26:13.049 --> 00:26:14.840
and were doing well
enough, but by the time

00:26:14.840 --> 00:26:19.030
we introduced the new packaging,
which is like a shiny aluminum

00:26:19.030 --> 00:26:22.950
bag, it looks like the
truck with the grill

00:26:22.950 --> 00:26:23.950
and headlights on there.

00:26:23.950 --> 00:26:25.660
And the windshield.

00:26:25.660 --> 00:26:29.236
It's a little hard to see there,
but really bright, fun colors.

00:26:29.236 --> 00:26:30.610
It's a more
affordable packaging.

00:26:30.610 --> 00:26:32.690
It's more differentiated
on the shelf.

00:26:32.690 --> 00:26:33.820
They started performing--

00:26:33.820 --> 00:26:36.039
FREYA ESTRELLER: Our
sales increased by 500%.

00:26:36.039 --> 00:26:36.830
NATASHA CASE: Yeah.

00:26:36.830 --> 00:26:38.455
FREYA ESTRELLER: So
just, but for here,

00:26:38.455 --> 00:26:42.010
this is just our getting
to minimum viable product,

00:26:42.010 --> 00:26:46.380
getting it out there,
measuring the feedback,

00:26:46.380 --> 00:26:49.160
revising the product,
making it better, and just

00:26:49.160 --> 00:26:51.509
like the whole notion of
action, not perfection

00:26:51.509 --> 00:26:52.800
when you're starting something.

00:26:52.800 --> 00:26:54.390
Like you just have
to get it out.

00:26:54.390 --> 00:26:55.709
And so we're glad that we did.

00:26:55.709 --> 00:26:56.500
NATASHA CASE: Yeah.

00:26:59.170 --> 00:27:03.710
And actually I had interns--
we had more toned down colors

00:27:03.710 --> 00:27:05.467
even on the shiny bags.

00:27:05.467 --> 00:27:07.550
And I had my interns last
summer go to Whole Foods

00:27:07.550 --> 00:27:10.530
and just kind of ask
people anonymously

00:27:10.530 --> 00:27:13.420
what packages they were
attracted to on the shelves.

00:27:13.420 --> 00:27:15.150
Or what kind of color schemes.

00:27:15.150 --> 00:27:17.875
And shockingly, everyone
likes bright, shiny objects

00:27:17.875 --> 00:27:19.580
with fun, bright colors.

00:27:19.580 --> 00:27:21.420
So I was like, oh.

00:27:21.420 --> 00:27:23.130
So anyway, we're
really continuing

00:27:23.130 --> 00:27:26.390
the kind of more bright
yellow, the purple, the pink.

00:27:26.390 --> 00:27:27.070
Really fun.

00:27:27.070 --> 00:27:29.570
And I think for me, as
an architect designing

00:27:29.570 --> 00:27:32.170
this product, as opposed to
a consumer packaged goods

00:27:32.170 --> 00:27:34.109
designer, it doesn't
look different and weird.

00:27:34.109 --> 00:27:35.650
But that's what
makes them stand out.

00:27:35.650 --> 00:27:39.890
So I think by not playing to
the generally accepted status

00:27:39.890 --> 00:27:42.150
quo, just kind of
doing our own thing.

00:27:42.150 --> 00:27:43.780
We've kind of walked
through some walls

00:27:43.780 --> 00:27:45.550
because we didn't
know they were there.

00:27:45.550 --> 00:27:48.150
And that's what's made
the brand succeed.

00:27:48.150 --> 00:27:50.690
The next step is now
getting outside of the-- you

00:27:50.690 --> 00:27:53.190
don't want to be a one trick
pony with ice cream sandwiches.

00:27:53.190 --> 00:27:55.540
So the pints are new this year.

00:27:55.540 --> 00:27:59.840
They kind of look like fun
paint buckets, in my opinion.

00:27:59.840 --> 00:28:02.350
But it's a
semi-transparent package

00:28:02.350 --> 00:28:04.540
so you can see the ice
cream on the inside.

00:28:04.540 --> 00:28:07.330
And just fun bright colors
that speak to the brand.

00:28:07.330 --> 00:28:09.870
The bars also are out this year.

00:28:09.870 --> 00:28:11.852
The flavors are really
sweet meets salty.

00:28:11.852 --> 00:28:13.310
One of them's
Tahitian vanilla bean

00:28:13.310 --> 00:28:16.406
dipped in salted caramel milk
chocolate rolled in pretzels.

00:28:16.406 --> 00:28:18.780
Ones like a Nutella bar and
salted chocolate and almonds.

00:28:18.780 --> 00:28:22.620
One's coffee Oreo
and salted chocolate.

00:28:22.620 --> 00:28:25.590
And then another
really important way

00:28:25.590 --> 00:28:28.140
that we diversified
is this book.

00:28:28.140 --> 00:28:30.600
What's really amazing and fun
about the book is it sort of

00:28:30.600 --> 00:28:32.940
brings everything full circle.

00:28:32.940 --> 00:28:36.690
As much as we can get the
prepackaged sandwiches

00:28:36.690 --> 00:28:40.320
to as many people as
possible with distribution,

00:28:40.320 --> 00:28:43.170
this is a whole other way to
bring our product home to you.

00:28:43.170 --> 00:28:45.170
You can make it
at home yourself.

00:28:45.170 --> 00:28:47.250
And these are really
our homemade recipes

00:28:47.250 --> 00:28:49.440
more that we started with.

00:28:49.440 --> 00:28:52.460
And a lot of insight
into way more

00:28:52.460 --> 00:28:55.570
flavors, obviously, than
we can ever put on a shelf.

00:28:55.570 --> 00:28:58.991
So we just love, again,
bringing the product

00:28:58.991 --> 00:29:00.240
to as many people as possible.

00:29:00.240 --> 00:29:02.600
The book has been such an
incredible way to do that.

00:29:02.600 --> 00:29:06.490
And I know and think you
guys will really enjoy it.

00:29:06.490 --> 00:29:07.480
So yeah.

00:29:10.410 --> 00:29:12.790
FREYA ESTRELLER: As we
wait for this ice cream

00:29:12.790 --> 00:29:15.985
to harden a little bit more.

00:29:15.985 --> 00:29:18.500
Do you guys have
any questions for us

00:29:18.500 --> 00:29:22.481
before we try some of this and
then release you to the truck?

00:29:22.481 --> 00:29:25.367
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]?

00:29:25.367 --> 00:29:26.810
NATASHA CASE: It's
getting there.

00:29:31.140 --> 00:29:32.530
And by the way,
we're just trying

00:29:32.530 --> 00:29:34.540
to get this to like
soft serve texture.

00:29:34.540 --> 00:29:36.541
And then it goes in the freezer.

00:29:36.541 --> 00:29:38.290
You don't eat it right
out of the machine.

00:29:38.290 --> 00:29:38.840
FREYA ESTRELLER: But you can.

00:29:38.840 --> 00:29:40.950
NATASHA CASE: I mean,
there's no hard rules here.

00:29:40.950 --> 00:29:43.870
Like, you can't go wrong.

00:29:43.870 --> 00:29:44.590
All right, yes.

00:29:44.590 --> 00:29:46.424
FREYA ESTRELLER: Yes.

00:29:46.424 --> 00:29:47.548
AUDIENCE: Is this thing on?

00:29:47.548 --> 00:29:48.900
Yes.

00:29:48.900 --> 00:29:52.526
I see you guys in a lot
of tech-related events.

00:29:52.526 --> 00:29:55.928
Is that something you targeted
explicitly or [INAUDIBLE]?

00:29:55.928 --> 00:29:59.330
[LAUGHTER]

00:29:59.330 --> 00:30:03.050
NATASHA CASE: You know, I would
say that Coolhaus lends itself

00:30:03.050 --> 00:30:05.651
so well to so many
different worlds.

00:30:05.651 --> 00:30:07.650
We've done a lot with
fashion and entertainment,

00:30:07.650 --> 00:30:09.380
a lot with tech.

00:30:09.380 --> 00:30:12.300
It's just people who
are forward thinking

00:30:12.300 --> 00:30:16.640
and who want to be adventurous
about what they're eating.

00:30:16.640 --> 00:30:18.890
That's what we really got
into with the ice cream.

00:30:18.890 --> 00:30:22.210
Is that it has such a broad
reach and broad appeal.

00:30:22.210 --> 00:30:24.950
But I will say we also,
I think, set up the brand

00:30:24.950 --> 00:30:27.050
so that it is a good
canvas for other brands.

00:30:27.050 --> 00:30:28.920
Like things like
the edible wrapper.

00:30:28.920 --> 00:30:31.960
The trucks get branded a lot.

00:30:31.960 --> 00:30:36.752
Totally like the staff,
whatever a brand wants

00:30:36.752 --> 00:30:39.210
them to wear in an activation,
I'm like, they're all yours.

00:30:39.210 --> 00:30:40.320
Don't tell them I said that.

00:30:40.320 --> 00:30:42.620
I'm like, they'll wear an
apron and a hat or whatever.

00:30:42.620 --> 00:30:44.837
So we do, I think,
mesh well with a lot

00:30:44.837 --> 00:30:46.170
of different types of companies.

00:30:46.170 --> 00:30:49.780
It really just has to do with
enjoying good food and, again,

00:30:49.780 --> 00:30:51.280
being adventurous
with what you like

00:30:51.280 --> 00:30:52.540
to eat as far as ice cream.

00:30:55.540 --> 00:30:58.540
AUDIENCE: So I couldn't help
but notice the "Dexter" wrapper.

00:30:58.540 --> 00:30:59.540
[LAUGHTER]

00:30:59.540 --> 00:31:03.244
So what's the story
behind that? [INAUDIBLE].

00:31:03.244 --> 00:31:04.660
NATASHA CASE: Yeah,
I mean I think

00:31:04.660 --> 00:31:09.800
that is a really good sequitur
from the last question.

00:31:09.800 --> 00:31:11.860
So last year, we
actually got approached

00:31:11.860 --> 00:31:14.040
by Showtime for the
finale season of "Dexter"

00:31:14.040 --> 00:31:17.000
to do something really special
to kind of commemorate it

00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:18.710
and see it off.

00:31:18.710 --> 00:31:22.630
And they came to us,
I feel, very much

00:31:22.630 --> 00:31:24.500
because we have
the boutique side

00:31:24.500 --> 00:31:26.760
with the trucks and
the brick and mortar.

00:31:26.760 --> 00:31:29.660
And the innovation and the
kind of small team who can

00:31:29.660 --> 00:31:32.740
think big, the cool
flavors, but we also

00:31:32.740 --> 00:31:35.129
have a more growing
national business

00:31:35.129 --> 00:31:36.920
arm, which was that
wholesale distribution.

00:31:36.920 --> 00:31:39.700
So they saw us as the
company they could partner

00:31:39.700 --> 00:31:41.920
up with that could do a
little bit of both for them.

00:31:41.920 --> 00:31:45.940
So what we did is they
kind of commissioned

00:31:45.940 --> 00:31:47.495
us to do a flavor
for that season.

00:31:47.495 --> 00:31:49.870
You've got to be a little
careful with the murder and ice

00:31:49.870 --> 00:31:50.400
cream theme.

00:31:50.400 --> 00:31:51.215
You know, that can be touchy.

00:31:51.215 --> 00:31:51.930
[LAUGHTER]

00:31:51.930 --> 00:31:53.820
But at South by
Southwest in 2013,

00:31:53.820 --> 00:31:56.960
we had the Bloody Orange
which was blood orange.

00:31:56.960 --> 00:32:00.890
And then we had the Killer Combo
which was Tahitian vanilla bean

00:32:00.890 --> 00:32:03.600
with a bloody cherry swirl
with two different cookies.

00:32:03.600 --> 00:32:05.600
The two sides of Dexter.

00:32:05.600 --> 00:32:08.170
And we did sort of a test
at South by Southwest

00:32:08.170 --> 00:32:10.080
in an event to see
which was more popular.

00:32:10.080 --> 00:32:11.690
The Killer Combo won.

00:32:11.690 --> 00:32:16.010
So we had that at our
stores all summer.

00:32:16.010 --> 00:32:19.020
They wrapped our trucks
in LA and New York

00:32:19.020 --> 00:32:21.800
and we did like 50 hours
of giveaway on the streets

00:32:21.800 --> 00:32:25.070
to promote that flavor
and the finale season.

00:32:25.070 --> 00:32:28.913
We had one of the
detectives on the truck.

00:32:28.913 --> 00:32:29.912
FREYA ESTRELLER: Masuka?

00:32:29.912 --> 00:32:30.320
NATASHA CASE: Yeah, Masuka?

00:32:30.320 --> 00:32:31.370
I don't know if
you watch the show.

00:32:31.370 --> 00:32:32.300
FREYA ESTRELLER:
I forget his name.

00:32:32.300 --> 00:32:33.210
NATASHA CASE: Giving it away.

00:32:33.210 --> 00:32:35.160
So that was fun, kind
of celebrity angle.

00:32:35.160 --> 00:32:36.980
And then we did a
pre-packaged version.

00:32:36.980 --> 00:32:39.800
Actually designed the bag for
them because that's what I do.

00:32:39.800 --> 00:32:41.570
And we took it to all
of our trade shows

00:32:41.570 --> 00:32:44.510
where we work with
retailers and they loved it.

00:32:44.510 --> 00:32:46.790
So so many stores,
like Whole Foods

00:32:46.790 --> 00:32:49.484
here in southern
California, Sprouts,

00:32:49.484 --> 00:32:51.900
tons of markets around the
country ended up picking it up.

00:32:51.900 --> 00:32:54.740
And it was sold in grocery
all over the country.

00:32:54.740 --> 00:32:57.022
And then also we had it
available for shipping online.

00:32:57.022 --> 00:32:58.980
A lot of people ordered
it in our online store.

00:32:58.980 --> 00:33:00.230
And we shipped it out to them.

00:33:00.230 --> 00:33:03.320
So it was just an amazing way
to partner with another brand,

00:33:03.320 --> 00:33:05.012
showcase us, and showcase them.

00:33:05.012 --> 00:33:06.220
And do something really cool.

00:33:10.156 --> 00:33:14.092
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
but how did

00:33:14.092 --> 00:33:15.568
you learn how to make ice cream?

00:33:15.568 --> 00:33:17.050
[LAUGHTER]

00:33:17.050 --> 00:33:19.560
NATASHA CASE: In studio.

00:33:19.560 --> 00:33:22.740
You know, I think that's
also a big point of the book.

00:33:22.740 --> 00:33:24.470
our feeling is we
don't want to make

00:33:24.470 --> 00:33:26.140
it intimidating
and unapproachable.

00:33:26.140 --> 00:33:26.980
Ice cream is fun.

00:33:26.980 --> 00:33:30.050
And if we can do it and we
don't have a formal cooking

00:33:30.050 --> 00:33:32.470
background, you
guys can do it too.

00:33:32.470 --> 00:33:35.100
And I think once you get the
basics of ice cream, literally,

00:33:35.100 --> 00:33:37.600
the base down, it's
just such a great canvas

00:33:37.600 --> 00:33:40.480
for innovation
and experimenting.

00:33:40.480 --> 00:33:42.430
And you can do a lot
with it without being

00:33:42.430 --> 00:33:43.630
like a trained pastry chef.

00:33:43.630 --> 00:33:46.970
So I think you can get one
good cookbook like ours

00:33:46.970 --> 00:33:48.930
and you can really
teach yourself.

00:33:48.930 --> 00:33:51.665
And get to be quite an
expert at it pretty quickly.

00:33:51.665 --> 00:33:54.290
FREYA ESTRELLER: Yeah, actually
the Dirty Mint that we're doing

00:33:54.290 --> 00:33:56.060
was actually an accident.

00:33:56.060 --> 00:33:59.505
Or sort of like part
laziness, part accident.

00:33:59.505 --> 00:34:00.672
We looked up a recipe--

00:34:00.672 --> 00:34:02.130
NATASHA CASE: Like
all good things.

00:34:02.130 --> 00:34:02.890
FREYA ESTRELLER: For
mint chip ice cream.

00:34:02.890 --> 00:34:05.400
And randomly it was,
like, who was it?

00:34:05.400 --> 00:34:08.460
Something like Isaac
Mizrahi's mint chip ice cream.

00:34:08.460 --> 00:34:10.580
So random.

00:34:10.580 --> 00:34:13.560
And it called for straining
the mint leaves out

00:34:13.560 --> 00:34:14.590
of the ice cream.

00:34:14.590 --> 00:34:17.550
And we were just kind
of lazy, or forgot,

00:34:17.550 --> 00:34:20.580
or didn't read the instructions
well, and left it in.

00:34:20.580 --> 00:34:23.969
And then it called for
white granulated sugar,

00:34:23.969 --> 00:34:24.929
but we ran out.

00:34:24.929 --> 00:34:27.154
And only had light brown sugar.

00:34:27.154 --> 00:34:28.820
And this is where the
laziness comes in.

00:34:28.820 --> 00:34:31.239
We didn't want to go out
to get the white sugar.

00:34:31.239 --> 00:34:32.880
We're like let's just use brown.

00:34:32.880 --> 00:34:36.020
And then when we tried it with
that combo and the mint left

00:34:36.020 --> 00:34:39.969
in, you guys will try it,
it's a whole nother world

00:34:39.969 --> 00:34:41.870
of mint chip ice cream.

00:34:41.870 --> 00:34:47.440
So it was happy accidents
like that where we realized

00:34:47.440 --> 00:34:51.573
like, oh, we can really
just get creative with this.

00:34:51.573 --> 00:34:53.489
NATASHA CASE: The cookies
are a little harder.

00:34:53.489 --> 00:34:54.399
I'm not going to lie.

00:34:54.399 --> 00:34:56.674
[LAUGHTER]

00:34:56.674 --> 00:34:58.464
AUDIENCE: Do you
use cream that's

00:34:58.464 --> 00:35:03.876
ultra-pasteurized
or [INAUDIBLE] which

00:35:03.876 --> 00:35:07.220
flavor difference in ice cream?

00:35:07.220 --> 00:35:09.890
NATASHA CASE: Yeah, not
necessarily ultra-pasteurized.

00:35:09.890 --> 00:35:13.520
I think less
processed is better.

00:35:13.520 --> 00:35:16.210
And you want it to
be on the fresh side.

00:35:16.210 --> 00:35:20.170
Also the eggs should be
not on their way out.

00:35:20.170 --> 00:35:24.120
I've even made ice cream with
raw dairy before, actually.

00:35:24.120 --> 00:35:26.206
Which I thought was delicious.

00:35:26.206 --> 00:35:27.580
And that goes bad
really quickly.

00:35:27.580 --> 00:35:31.400
So I just had to find
a good use for it.

00:35:31.400 --> 00:35:36.040
And to that point, a fun tip
from the book is with sorbets,

00:35:36.040 --> 00:35:38.800
they're a great thing to do with
fruit when it's on its way out.

00:35:38.800 --> 00:35:41.880
Like how it's sort of famous
that you make banana bread

00:35:41.880 --> 00:35:45.200
with bananas as
they're almost rotting.

00:35:45.200 --> 00:35:48.205
Fruit when it's almost
past the point of even just

00:35:48.205 --> 00:35:50.330
wanting to eat it on its
own is perfect for sorbet.

00:35:50.330 --> 00:35:52.160
Because it has the
highest sugar content.

00:35:52.160 --> 00:35:54.620
So I actually find
that ice cream

00:35:54.620 --> 00:35:58.090
is a really great utilitarian
way of not wasting products.

00:35:58.090 --> 00:36:01.270
Whether it's the dairy or fruit
that you could throw away.

00:36:07.829 --> 00:36:08.870
FREYA ESTRELLER: Awesome.

00:36:08.870 --> 00:36:09.894
Well, I think, I--

00:36:09.894 --> 00:36:12.060
NATASHA CASE: Yeah, we're
getting pretty close here.

00:36:12.060 --> 00:36:12.110
Perfect timing.

00:36:12.110 --> 00:36:13.943
FREYA ESTRELLER: We're
getting really close.

00:36:13.943 --> 00:36:16.440
And maybe if we can get
some spoons off the truck

00:36:16.440 --> 00:36:19.110
or is there, do you guys have
little like taster spoons?

00:36:19.110 --> 00:36:20.360
I totally forgot about that.

00:36:20.360 --> 00:36:24.120
I want you guys to come up
here and taste the base.

00:36:24.120 --> 00:36:26.060
So you guys know
what the base should

00:36:26.060 --> 00:36:28.230
taste like and the consistency.

00:36:28.230 --> 00:36:31.927
And that also taste the homemade
Dirty Mint Chip ice cream,

00:36:31.927 --> 00:36:33.760
which you guys will be
able to make at home.

00:36:33.760 --> 00:36:34.510
NATASHA CASE: On
the other side, I

00:36:34.510 --> 00:36:37.250
don't know if there's any,
like, beer snobs out there.

00:36:37.250 --> 00:36:40.500
We wanted to do this chocolate
stout ice cream with pretzels.

00:36:40.500 --> 00:36:44.360
And we told one of our kind
of non-beer snob, slightly

00:36:44.360 --> 00:36:47.780
non-foodie employees to go and
get like a chocolate stout.

00:36:47.780 --> 00:36:49.860
Try to find Rasputin if you can.

00:36:49.860 --> 00:36:52.725
And he instead
decides to buy Spaten.

00:36:52.725 --> 00:36:55.100
I don't know if you know, It's
sort of like German Corona

00:36:55.100 --> 00:36:55.250
basically.

00:36:55.250 --> 00:36:55.720
FREYA ESTRELLER:
It's like a lager.

00:36:55.720 --> 00:36:56.511
NATASHA CASE: Yeah.

00:36:56.511 --> 00:36:57.390
[LAUGHTER]

00:36:57.390 --> 00:36:59.984
And just brought it
directly to the facility

00:36:59.984 --> 00:37:01.150
and they started running it.

00:37:01.150 --> 00:37:03.376
And so when we got
that, when it was done

00:37:03.376 --> 00:37:04.750
and we were tasting
it, I'm like,

00:37:04.750 --> 00:37:06.310
something is wrong
with this beer.

00:37:06.310 --> 00:37:06.810
Or it just.

00:37:06.810 --> 00:37:09.018
FREYA ESTRELLER: You could
tell it was light-colored.

00:37:09.018 --> 00:37:11.570
It's supposed to be like this
dark, rich chocolatey color.

00:37:11.570 --> 00:37:12.380
You're like, wait a minute.

00:37:12.380 --> 00:37:14.320
NATASHA CASE: He couldn't
understand the difference

00:37:14.320 --> 00:37:14.820
basically.

00:37:14.820 --> 00:37:17.060
For us, it was
like night and day.

00:37:17.060 --> 00:37:20.269
So it was very-- and I tried
to give that ice cream away.

00:37:20.269 --> 00:37:22.560
The Spaten ice cream to
different employees or friends.

00:37:22.560 --> 00:37:25.900
And for some reason, it kept
ending up back in the freezer.

00:37:25.900 --> 00:37:26.400
[LAUGHTER]

00:37:26.400 --> 00:37:28.483
It was like we couldn't
get rid of it if we tried.

00:37:28.483 --> 00:37:30.330
It kept showing up again.

00:37:30.330 --> 00:37:33.150
So it kind of became the bane.

00:37:33.150 --> 00:37:38.016
But those were, you know,
it's a rare full-on failure

00:37:38.016 --> 00:37:39.140
when it comes to ice cream.

00:37:39.140 --> 00:37:41.080
You can really
push it quite far.

00:37:41.080 --> 00:37:43.260
We have the Peking Duck ice
cream which works great.

00:37:43.260 --> 00:37:45.010
White Chocolate Olive,
that's a weird one.

00:37:45.010 --> 00:37:47.220
It's delicious, I promise you.

00:37:47.220 --> 00:37:50.930
So it's really, it's hard
to have a complete fail.

00:37:50.930 --> 00:37:54.740
Write to me if you fail hardcore
and we'll talk about it.

00:37:54.740 --> 00:37:56.010
[LAUGHTER]

00:37:56.010 --> 00:37:56.830
FREYA ESTRELLER:
Awesome, well, yeah, I--

00:37:56.830 --> 00:37:58.130
NATASHA CASE: One other
thing I want to mention too,

00:37:58.130 --> 00:38:00.490
by the way, you have
your books, but the ebook

00:38:00.490 --> 00:38:02.540
is also really cool.

00:38:02.540 --> 00:38:08.290
It's a lot of the content
from the cookbook obviously.

00:38:08.290 --> 00:38:10.940
But the enhancement
is the audio.

00:38:10.940 --> 00:38:13.540
Which we focus for
the ebook, since it's

00:38:13.540 --> 00:38:15.070
on iBooks and iTunes.

00:38:15.070 --> 00:38:18.210
On the music side of Coolhaus--
you want to go to that slide?

00:38:18.210 --> 00:38:19.890
FREYA ESTRELLER: Yeah.

00:38:19.890 --> 00:38:21.940
NATASHA CASE: This
is our Austin General

00:38:21.940 --> 00:38:24.700
Manager with Tegan and Sarah.

00:38:24.700 --> 00:38:26.580
We have this up here
as an example of we

00:38:26.580 --> 00:38:29.142
do a lot of-- music is
really important at Coolhaus.

00:38:29.142 --> 00:38:30.350
It's a big part of our brand.

00:38:30.350 --> 00:38:32.145
I think Michael Allen's
on the truck, right?

00:38:32.145 --> 00:38:32.410
FREYA ESTRELLER: Mhm.

00:38:32.410 --> 00:38:34.150
NATASHA CASE: We have a lot of
employees-- including Michael

00:38:34.150 --> 00:38:35.810
Allen, you can
ask him about it--

00:38:35.810 --> 00:38:37.840
on the truck who are musicians.

00:38:37.840 --> 00:38:39.480
We're very supportive
of what they do.

00:38:39.480 --> 00:38:41.070
We've done Coolhaus
playlists where

00:38:41.070 --> 00:38:44.460
we feature all of our different
employees who are in bands.

00:38:44.460 --> 00:38:45.860
Like, you know, top songs.

00:38:45.860 --> 00:38:48.307
And we play that from the
trucks and the stores.

00:38:48.307 --> 00:38:50.140
And we partner with a
lot of musical artists

00:38:50.140 --> 00:38:54.440
to do special sandwiches for
them at ACL, at Coachella,

00:38:54.440 --> 00:38:57.360
or for certain good
causes with them.

00:38:57.360 --> 00:38:59.579
We did a marriage equality
sandwich called Till Death

00:38:59.579 --> 00:39:01.870
Do Us Part, double chocolate
cookie, salted caramel ice

00:39:01.870 --> 00:39:02.980
cream.

00:39:02.980 --> 00:39:04.710
And we've kind of
gone on tour with them

00:39:04.710 --> 00:39:09.570
at the Hollywood Bowl, at
the Greek theater, at ACL.

00:39:09.570 --> 00:39:13.800
And handed away the sandwich
in the name of that good cause.

00:39:13.800 --> 00:39:16.332
So in the ebook,
there's little anecdotes

00:39:16.332 --> 00:39:18.290
that I tell about the
different musical artists

00:39:18.290 --> 00:39:20.880
that we've teamed up with
and what their flavors are

00:39:20.880 --> 00:39:22.640
that we've done with them.

00:39:22.640 --> 00:39:25.940
And then it connects to playlist
by those artists in iTunes.

00:39:25.940 --> 00:39:29.200
So just as a whole kind of
cool other angle on Coolhaus.

00:39:29.200 --> 00:39:30.780
As though we needed
to be cooler.

00:39:30.780 --> 00:39:32.240
[LAUGHTER]

00:39:32.240 --> 00:39:33.120
I'm just kidding.

00:39:33.120 --> 00:39:34.280
But anyway, it's fun.

00:39:34.280 --> 00:39:36.427
So would recommend
the, I just wanted

00:39:36.427 --> 00:39:38.760
to mention why the ebook is
a little different if you're

00:39:38.760 --> 00:39:39.539
interested too.

00:39:39.539 --> 00:39:40.580
FREYA ESTRELLER: Awesome.

00:39:40.580 --> 00:39:41.955
Well, yeah, I'd
love for you guys

00:39:41.955 --> 00:39:45.050
to come up here and try
the base and the ice cream.

00:39:45.050 --> 00:39:46.735
And then the truck is outside.

00:39:46.735 --> 00:39:49.110
NATASHA CASE: Yeah.

00:39:49.110 --> 00:39:49.880
Thank you, guys.

00:39:49.880 --> 00:39:52.630
[APPLAUSE]
