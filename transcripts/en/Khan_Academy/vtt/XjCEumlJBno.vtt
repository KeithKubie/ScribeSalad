00:00:00.538 --> 00:00:04.054
What I want to do in this video is a calculus proof of the famous

00:00:04.054 --> 00:00:07.862
centripetal acceleration formula that tells us the magnitude

00:00:07.862 --> 00:00:10.824
of centripetal acceleration, the actual direction will change

00:00:10.824 --> 00:00:14.901
it's always going to be pointing inwards, but the magnitude of centripetal acceleration is equal to the

00:00:14.901 --> 00:00:19.235
magnitude of the velocity-squared divided by the radius

00:00:19.358 --> 00:00:23.082
I want to be very clear, this is a scalar formula right over here; we're talking about the magnitude

00:00:23.082 --> 00:00:26.410
of the acceleration and the magnitude of the velocity. If these were vectors,

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:30.045
we would have arrows drawn over it. So this really, I don't want people to get confused

00:00:30.045 --> 00:00:34.313
because this is a v, this is really referring to the speed-squared.

00:00:34.313 --> 00:00:36.859
and this is the magnitude, and these are all

00:00:36.859 --> 00:00:41.094
scalar quantities. So to do that, let's imagine some

00:00:41.094 --> 00:00:45.366
object, maybe it's some object in orbit around a planet or something,

00:00:45.366 --> 00:00:48.830
so let's say that's the planet, and you have some object

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:52.087
that is in orbit around the planet, and it is going in a counter-clockwise

00:00:52.087 --> 00:00:56.273
direction, and so let's specify its position vector as

00:00:56.273 --> 00:00:58.657
a function as time.

00:01:01.519 --> 00:01:04.199
So that is its position vector and it is going to

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:07.999
change as a function of time as this thing spins around

00:01:07.999 --> 00:01:11.569
We're going to assume, for the purposes of this

00:01:11.569 --> 00:01:13.430
proof.

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:19.893
So that is our

00:01:19.893 --> 00:01:23.307
y-axis, and this is our x-axis.

00:01:23.645 --> 00:01:27.532
We're going to define theta as the angle between the positive

00:01:27.532 --> 00:01:30.051
x-axis and our vector.

00:01:31.189 --> 00:01:35.199
And we're going to assume this thing is in orbit with the radius of r. So the

00:01:35.199 --> 00:01:39.284
magnitude of our position vector, even though the direction is going to change

00:01:39.284 --> 00:01:43.400
the magnitude of our position vector is not going to change. It's always going to have

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:47.068
length r. So this is going in a circle with radius r.

00:01:47.345 --> 00:01:50.345
The magnitude of our position vector,

00:01:50.345 --> 00:01:54.635
which is changing as a function of time, is going to be

00:01:54.635 --> 00:01:58.628
r. So how can we write

00:01:58.628 --> 00:02:03.348
the position vector in terms of its components at any given time?

00:02:03.348 --> 00:02:06.881
We can write the position vector, and I'll do it in engineering notation,

00:02:06.881 --> 00:02:09.562
and so you might want to review those videos if some of this looks foreign and I'll

00:02:09.562 --> 00:02:14.026
do a bit of basic trigonometry in breaking down the vector into its components

00:02:14.026 --> 00:02:17.557
and I encourage you to review some of those videos if some of that looks a bit

00:02:17.557 --> 00:02:23.006
daunting. If you take the position vector at any time,

00:02:23.006 --> 00:02:25.263
the magnitude is r,

00:02:25.263 --> 00:02:28.475
this angle is theta,

00:02:28.475 --> 00:02:33.274
its x-component, in blue,

00:02:33.274 --> 00:02:37.905
this vector right over here, the magnitude of the vector, I should say,

00:02:37.905 --> 00:02:41.380
is going to be r cosine of theta

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:44.512
We learned that this came from basic trigonometry when we started

00:02:44.512 --> 00:02:48.443
two-dimensional projectile motion, we saw how to break these

00:02:48.443 --> 00:02:55.263
vectors down into its components, and the y-component of this vector

00:02:55.294 --> 00:02:58.457
is going to be r sine of theta

00:03:00.704 --> 00:03:03.989
So this is going to be r sine of

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:09.113
theta. So the position vector at any time

00:03:09.113 --> 00:03:11.972
can be written as a sum of its x- and y-components.

00:03:11.972 --> 00:03:15.083
So it's the magnitude of its x-component, it's going to be

00:03:15.083 --> 00:03:20.174
r cosine of theta, and I could write theta as a function of

00:03:20.174 --> 00:03:23.886
time if I'd like, but I'm just going to write r cosine of theta

00:03:23.886 --> 00:03:27.035
actually, let me write it that way, so it shows theta is a function of time

00:03:27.035 --> 00:03:30.503
This thing is moving, and there's going to be that times the

00:03:30.503 --> 00:03:34.870
i-unit vector, we're in engineering notation over here.

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:38.353
So that's the i-unit vector, it tells us that the x-component

00:03:38.353 --> 00:03:42.507
is going in the positive x direction. Plus

00:03:42.507 --> 00:03:45.479
the magnitude of the y-component, which is

00:03:45.479 --> 00:03:50.443
r sine of theta, which is going to be a function of time.

00:03:50.443 --> 00:03:54.715
So to be clear, the function of time applies to the theta.

00:03:57.484 --> 00:03:58.371
And that is going

00:03:58.371 --> 00:04:00.603
in the j-direction.

00:04:02.818 --> 00:04:05.284
So that is our j-unit vector.

00:04:07.853 --> 00:04:10.774
So now we have position as a function of theta

00:04:10.774 --> 00:04:14.122
which is actually a function of time. So let's take the derivative of

00:04:14.122 --> 00:04:19.627
this thing right here. So what is

00:04:19.627 --> 00:04:26.818
the derivative of our position vector with respect to time

00:04:26.818 --> 00:04:30.754
Well that's just going to be our velocity vector,

00:04:30.754 --> 00:04:34.625
as a function of time, and it's going to be equal to

00:04:34.625 --> 00:04:38.375
we just have to take the derivative of each of these parts with respect to

00:04:38.375 --> 00:04:42.222
time. And you just do the chain rule. So you're going to have

00:04:42.222 --> 00:04:45.646
the r sit outside cause that's just a constant. So you're going to have r

00:04:45.646 --> 00:04:50.277
the derivative of cosine of theta t with respect to theta t

00:04:50.277 --> 00:04:53.523
So I'm just doing the chain rule right over here. That's going to be

00:04:53.523 --> 00:04:58.361
negative sine of theta t

00:04:58.361 --> 00:05:01.746
and then as the chain rule, we also have to multiply that

00:05:01.746 --> 00:05:04.705
times the derivative of the theta of t

00:05:04.705 --> 00:05:10.122
with respect to t. So times d-theta, dt

00:05:10.122 --> 00:05:12.929
so this is just the chain rule right over here.

00:05:12.929 --> 00:05:16.882
So that's going to be how it's changing in the x-direction, and in the y-direction

00:05:16.882 --> 00:05:19.999
we do something very similar. In the y-direction

00:05:19.999 --> 00:05:23.305
we take the same derivative. We have the r scalar out front

00:05:23.305 --> 00:05:26.964
r, and then the derivative of sine of theta

00:05:26.964 --> 00:05:31.030
with respect to theta is going to be cosine of theta

00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:34.947
and I'll write it as a function of time, and then do the chain rule

00:05:34.947 --> 00:05:39.513
you'll also have to multiply that by the rate at which theta is changing with respect to t,

00:05:39.513 --> 00:05:42.885
times d-theta, dt,

00:05:42.885 --> 00:05:50.287
and this is all going to be times our j-unit vector. Now,

00:05:50.287 --> 00:05:54.418
there's something you might already realize, and you should rewatch the video

00:05:54.418 --> 00:05:57.691
on angular velocity if this is foreign to you, but

00:05:57.691 --> 00:06:01.759
d-theta, dt, this is our angular velocity.

00:06:01.759 --> 00:06:05.741
That's why I said to rewatch that video. This right over here, the rate at which

00:06:05.741 --> 00:06:09.333
the angle changes with respect to time, that is angular velocity.

00:06:09.333 --> 00:06:13.314
So this right over here is

00:06:13.314 --> 00:06:17.311
angular velocity. And for the sake of this

00:06:17.311 --> 00:06:21.362
video, this is an assumption we'll have to make for this formula right over here

00:06:21.362 --> 00:06:25.432
we're going to assume, that omega, which is the rate of change

00:06:25.432 --> 00:06:28.315
of our angle with respect to time, we're going to assume

00:06:28.315 --> 00:06:31.931
that this is constant.

00:06:32.754 --> 00:06:36.911
So this is an assumption we're making for this proof. This is we are going

00:06:36.911 --> 00:06:40.357
to assume that omega is constant. And if omega is

00:06:40.357 --> 00:06:44.227
constant, then we can treat it as a constant and we can factor

00:06:44.227 --> 00:06:47.413
it out of this expression. So let's factor out

00:06:47.413 --> 00:06:52.948
a negative omega-r from this expression over here. So we can rewrite

00:06:53.533 --> 00:06:56.420
our velocity as a function of time is equal to

00:06:56.420 --> 00:07:00.285
I'm going to factor out a negative omega

00:07:00.285 --> 00:07:04.420
times r, and if you factor out a negative omega-r,

00:07:04.420 --> 00:07:08.681
what you're left with is

00:07:08.681 --> 00:07:10.896
this first term,

00:07:14.215 --> 00:07:20.069
sine of theta-t

00:07:21.438 --> 00:07:25.932
And I didn't have to make it explicit that theta is a function of t, but this makes it explicit

00:07:25.932 --> 00:07:30.920
that theta is a function of t, and then times

00:07:30.920 --> 00:07:35.772
our i-unit vector,

00:07:35.772 --> 00:07:39.531
plus, so if we're factoring out

00:07:39.531 --> 00:07:44.312
a negative omega-r, this becomes negative

00:07:44.312 --> 00:07:46.817
cosine of theta,

00:07:46.817 --> 00:07:51.164
which is a function of t, and that

00:07:51.164 --> 00:07:55.544
is times our j-unit vector.

00:07:58.177 --> 00:07:59.389
So we factored out

00:07:59.420 --> 00:08:02.114
a negative omega-r. Now let's take the derivative of

00:08:02.114 --> 00:08:05.784
this with respect to time. So if we take

00:08:07.184 --> 00:08:09.999
the derivative of velocity

00:08:09.999 --> 00:08:13.964
with respect to time, this is clearly just what the acceleration is

00:08:13.964 --> 00:08:17.515
as a function of time, and we're going to assume that the magnitude of this thing

00:08:17.515 --> 00:08:21.048
is constant, but the actual direction is changing, so this is the acceleration

00:08:21.048 --> 00:08:26.564
as a function of time, is going to be equal to

00:08:28.795 --> 00:08:29.620
this negative

00:08:29.620 --> 00:08:32.656
omega-r, so what is the derivative of

00:08:32.656 --> 00:08:36.935
this thing right over here? So the derivative of sine with respect to theta,

00:08:36.985 --> 00:08:38.581
we're just doing the chain rule here,

00:08:38.581 --> 00:08:40.635
the derivative of sine with respect to theta

00:08:40.635 --> 00:08:46.828
is going to be cosine of theta

00:08:46.878 --> 00:08:49.049
as a function of t.

00:08:49.049 --> 00:08:52.464
And then chain rule, we also have to take that and multiply it with the derivative of theta

00:08:52.514 --> 00:08:54.701
with respect to t.

00:08:56.498 --> 00:08:59.788
I could write d-theta, dt here

00:08:59.788 --> 00:09:03.759
But that once again, is just omega.

00:09:03.759 --> 00:09:08.043
So that is just omega, and that of course

00:09:08.043 --> 00:09:12.774
is in the i-direction. And from that,

00:09:12.774 --> 00:09:14.808
and next to that, we take the derivative of

00:09:14.808 --> 00:09:19.515
cosine of theta of t with respect to theta, so that's going to be

00:09:19.515 --> 00:09:23.115
that would be negative sine of theta, so we would have a negative out front

00:09:23.115 --> 00:09:27.543
so it becomes positive sine of

00:09:27.543 --> 00:09:30.942
theta as a function of t.

00:09:30.942 --> 00:09:35.396
And then we have to do the chain rule, the derivative of theta with respect to t.

00:09:35.396 --> 00:09:38.125
We have to multiply by this, and for that we could write

00:09:38.125 --> 00:09:42.806
d-theta, dt right there, but that again is the same thing

00:09:42.806 --> 00:09:45.824
as omega. And all that is being multiplied by the

00:09:45.824 --> 00:09:48.728
j-unit vector.

00:09:51.120 --> 00:09:54.998
So now let's factor out this other omega, and we get something interesting,

00:09:54.998 --> 00:09:58.795
we get the acceleration vector as a function of

00:09:58.795 --> 00:10:02.513
time is equal to, and if we factor out another omega, we get

00:10:02.513 --> 00:10:06.455
negative omega-squared r,

00:10:06.455 --> 00:10:11.224
I'm just factoring out another negative omega,

00:10:11.224 --> 00:10:16.550
times, and I'll write it in parentheses here,

00:10:16.550 --> 00:10:21.040
cosine of theta

00:10:21.040 --> 00:10:23.025
as a function of t

00:10:23.025 --> 00:10:26.668
times our i-unit vector

00:10:26.668 --> 00:10:29.707
plus

00:10:29.707 --> 00:10:34.025
sine of theta, which is a function of t

00:10:34.025 --> 00:10:37.659
times our j-unit vector.

00:10:37.659 --> 00:10:45.467
Now what is all of this business right over here?

00:10:45.467 --> 00:10:49.401
Just look at this part right over here, well r times this,

00:10:49.401 --> 00:10:53.813
especially if you distributed the r, that is exactly this thing right over here

00:10:53.813 --> 00:10:57.462
If you distribute the r, you get exactly r cosine theta as a function

00:10:57.462 --> 00:11:01.241
of t times our i-unit vector plus our sine theta as a

00:11:01.241 --> 00:11:06.582
function of t times the j-unit vector. So everything that I squared-off in orange right over here,

00:11:06.582 --> 00:11:13.135
this is our position vector as a function of time.

00:11:13.135 --> 00:11:14.975
So all that work we did, we just got a

00:11:14.975 --> 00:11:19.135
very interesting result. We got that our acceleration vector

00:11:19.135 --> 00:11:23.384
as a function of time is equal to the negative

00:11:23.384 --> 00:11:32.767
of our constant angular velocity-squared

00:11:32.767 --> 00:11:34.829
times our position vector

00:11:34.829 --> 00:11:37.928
And just to be clear, angular velocity is kind of the pseudo vector,

00:11:37.928 --> 00:11:42.248
it tends to be treated like a scalar, especially when you're dealing with two-dimensionals

00:11:42.248 --> 00:11:47.311
like this, it's really a pseudo scalar, but let's just go with this.

00:11:47.311 --> 00:11:51.294
We're assuming this right over here is a constant scalar quantity.

00:11:51.909 --> 00:11:55.721
Now, we're very very very very close here.

00:11:55.721 --> 00:11:58.978
Now what we want to do is to relate this

00:11:58.978 --> 00:12:02.591
this is essentially the scalar version of it, so if we wanted

00:12:02.591 --> 00:12:05.774
to take the magnitudes of both sides,

00:12:05.774 --> 00:12:10.021
so we're saying the acceleration vector is equal to this constant times

00:12:10.021 --> 00:12:19.116
the position vector, so let's take the magnitude of both sides of this thing

00:12:19.116 --> 00:12:22.615
So then we get the magnitude of the acceleration vector,

00:12:22.615 --> 00:12:24.462
which I'm just going to call a sub c,

00:12:24.462 --> 00:12:26.880
is going to be equal to

00:12:26.880 --> 00:12:29.790
you could say the magnitude of this negative omega-squared

00:12:29.790 --> 00:12:32.645
but when you take the magnitude, it's like taking the absolute value

00:12:32.645 --> 00:12:35.464
in fact, absolute value is just the one-dimensional version of magnitude,

00:12:35.464 --> 00:12:38.107
that's just going to be positive omega-squared

00:12:38.107 --> 00:12:41.488
we don't care about the direction, sign gives us the direction, we just care about

00:12:41.488 --> 00:12:48.076
the actual size. So this is going to be

00:12:48.076 --> 00:12:50.255
the magnitude of negative omega-squared

00:12:50.255 --> 00:12:54.642
times the magnitude of our position vector

00:12:54.642 --> 00:12:58.517
the magnitude of omega-squared is just going to be omega-squared

00:12:58.517 --> 00:13:01.797
you can get rid of the sign, and the magnitude of our position vector

00:13:01.797 --> 00:13:05.167
we saw at the beginning of this video, is just r,

00:13:05.167 --> 00:13:08.563
our radius

00:13:09.317 --> 00:13:13.277
so this right over here is just going to be equal to

00:13:13.277 --> 00:13:16.051
the radius of the circle that we're going around.

00:13:16.189 --> 00:13:19.884
Now, we also know the angular velocity, or

00:13:19.884 --> 00:13:24.367
the magnitude of the angular velocity, is equal to the

00:13:24.367 --> 00:13:28.433
magnitude of our velocity, or the speed of our

00:13:28.433 --> 00:13:32.101
object, divided by the radius of the circle

00:13:32.101 --> 00:13:35.913
that it is going around. So we could substitute that right over here.

00:13:35.913 --> 00:13:42.648
So if we square it, this is going to be (v over r)-squared, now we saw that in the video on angular velocity,

00:13:42.648 --> 00:13:44.687
times r

00:13:44.687 --> 00:13:47.424
and this is all going to be the magnitude of our acceleration,

00:13:47.424 --> 00:13:51.490
which is really our centripetal acceleration, our inward directed acceleration.

00:13:51.798 --> 00:13:56.021
So this is going to be equal to, and I think you see where this is going,

00:13:56.021 --> 00:13:59.869
This is equal to v-squared over r-squared

00:13:59.869 --> 00:14:02.970
times r, but this r cancels out

00:14:02.970 --> 00:14:06.688
with the r-squared, so you're just left with v-squared

00:14:06.688 --> 00:14:09.004
over r, and you're done!

00:14:09.004 --> 00:14:13.654
The magnitude of the centripetal acceleration is equal to your speed,

00:14:13.654 --> 00:14:17.161
the magnitude of your velocity, squared, divided by

00:14:17.161 --> 99:59:59.999
your radius. And, we are done.
