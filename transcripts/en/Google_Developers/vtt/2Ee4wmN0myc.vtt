00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:06.069
&gt;&gt;Rishi Chandra: Like Ambarish mentioned,
this has huge potential for you.

00:00:06.069 --> 00:00:09.269
Right?
Because if you look at it, traditionally,

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:16.930
the living room and the entire TV ecosystem
has been closed, fragmented, and totally inaccessible.

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:22.480
You've never had a chance to really engage
with those users spending five hours a day

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:27.060
in front of this device.
Well, today, that can change.

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:33.820
Our goal with Google TV is to create an entire
new category of devices that are built around

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:39.820
openness, open for users to go wherever they
want on the open Web.

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:46.059
Open for developers to create new applications
specifically targeted for the living room.

00:00:46.059 --> 00:00:51.269
And open to content owners to create new experiences
around their existing content and new ways

00:00:51.269 --> 00:00:57.739
to distribute it.
Your TV just got a lot smarter.

00:00:57.739 --> 00:01:02.409
And our goal is to have the same impact on
the TV experience that the smartphone had

00:01:02.409 --> 00:01:07.960
on the mobile experience.
But, of course, we can't do this alone.

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:12.990
We need the help of the entire TV ecosystem
to take the platform and push it forward.

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:16.530
Whether it be a manufacturer, an operator,
distributor, or more.

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:20.230
And the only way to do that is if we are open
as well.

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:24.530
So I'm also happy to announce that what you
saw today, the Google TV platform, will be

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:28.180
open sourced into both the Android and Chrome
source trees.

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:36.170
[ Applause ]
&gt;&gt;Rishi Chandra: Okay.

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:38.950
So now we've talked a lot about the platform
and the product.

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:45.090
So one major question is still left.
How is this coming to market?

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:48.180
Well, I'm happy to say, we're coming in a
big way.

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:52.901
'Cause we've partnered with some of the world's
leading consumer electronics brands, as well

00:01:52.901 --> 00:01:59.840
as those leading the TV ecosystem, to deliver
three Google TV devices.

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:04.350
The first is from a company you may have heard
of, called Sony.

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:08.610
One of the leading innovators --
[ Applause ]

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:13.489
&gt;&gt;Rishi Chandra: Thank you.
-- one of the leading innovators in consumer

00:02:13.489 --> 00:02:19.269
electronics and on the television itself.
They will be launching a full line of integrated

00:02:19.269 --> 00:02:27.170
TVs and integrated Blu-ray player.
Second is from Logitech, another innovating

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:30.280
company for living room technology.
[ Applause ]

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:36.000
&gt;&gt;Rishi Chandra: They will be launching a
companion box which allows you to easily integrate

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.090
Google TV within your existing setup.
And the great thing is they're going to be

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:43.240
creating an entire new set of peripherals
around Google TV.

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:48.959
So you can even take the experience we showed
you today and even go further.

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:52.459
And then for the chipset, we've partnered
with Intel.

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:56.569
Intel will be powering all three of these
devices with their Intel Atom processor, which

00:02:56.569 --> 00:03:00.099
can allow us to have a great experience across
TV and Web.

00:03:00.099 --> 00:03:03.540
And it's coming in fall 2010.
[ Applause ]

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:13.200
&gt;&gt;Rishi Chandra: This is going to be an exciting
year.

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:17.670
But there's more.
We've also partnered with DISH Network.

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:22.299
We've actually been working with DISH for
several months on this platform to really

00:03:22.299 --> 00:03:26.620
get the user experience right.
And we're actually working on an enhanced

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:31.689
Google TV experience using the IP control
protocol that Vincent actually mentioned earlier.

00:03:31.689 --> 00:03:37.650
So DISH subscribers will be able to seamlessly
integrate their DVR and DOD content into the

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:42.579
Google TV experience.
And then, finally, we need a way to get it

00:03:42.579 --> 00:03:47.670
into your hands.
So we've partnered with Best Buy, the nation's

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:51.739
leading consumer electronics company, to get
these products directly into your hands in

00:03:51.739 --> 00:03:53.719
an easy way.
All right.

00:03:53.719 --> 00:03:59.439
So what's the time line for developers?
Well, like Ambarish mentioned, today, you

00:03:59.439 --> 00:04:04.809
can start take your existing sites and enhancing
them for the TV experience, even right out

00:04:04.809 --> 00:04:08.669
of the box.
Early 2011, we'll be launching the Android

00:04:08.669 --> 00:04:14.610
Market with an over-the-air update, as well
as Google TV SDK and TV Web API, so we can

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:17.180
actually do a lot of the integration you saw
today.

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:21.940
And then, finally, summer 2011, we will open
source the platform into the Android and Chrome

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:27.910
source trees.
This is an incredibly exciting time for users,

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:34.040
for developers, for everyone in the TV ecosystem.
By taking the best of what TV has to offer

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:38.810
today and the best of what the Web has to
offer today, we can create an entirely new

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:43.770
entertainment experience, one that's built
on openness, and we can enable new forms of

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:45.770
innovation in the living room we've never
seen before.
