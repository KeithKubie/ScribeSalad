00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:03.369
We have the number 357.

00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:05.806
So the three is in the hundreds place.

00:00:05.892 --> 00:00:07.726
So that represents three hundreds:

00:00:07.726 --> 00:00:10.478
one hundred, two hundred, three hundreds.

00:00:10.478 --> 00:00:14.553
Three hundreds right over here,

00:00:14.553 --> 00:00:16.500
that's what this three represents,

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.120
'cause it's in the hundreds place.

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:22.227
Let me write that. This is the hundreds place.

00:00:22.227 --> 00:00:25.826
Then we have a five in the tens place.

00:00:26.736 --> 00:00:31.294
So that represents one, two, three, four, five tens.

00:00:31.294 --> 00:00:33.396
Five tens.

00:00:33.396 --> 00:00:36.176
And then last but not least we have,

00:00:36.176 --> 00:00:38.922
in the ones place, we have seven.

00:00:38.922 --> 00:00:40.756
So that represents seven ones:

00:00:40.756 --> 00:00:45.372
one, two, three, four, five, six, seven. Seven ones.

00:00:45.726 --> 00:00:49.920
Now from that, we want to subtract 251;

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:51.540
or, we want to subtract two hundreds,

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:54.150
five tens, and one one.

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:55.667
So pause this video and think about

00:00:55.667 --> 00:00:57.797
what that is going to be.

00:00:58.267 --> 00:01:00.508
So let's work through this together.

00:01:00.728 --> 00:01:02.542
Let's first focus on the ones.

00:01:02.542 --> 00:01:04.533
We're starting off with seven ones

00:01:04.533 --> 00:01:06.937
in three hundreds, five tens, and seven ones.

00:01:06.937 --> 00:01:09.183
357. Seven ones.

00:01:09.183 --> 00:01:12.472
And we are going to take away

00:01:12.472 --> 00:01:14.225
one one right over here.

00:01:14.225 --> 00:01:15.669
Let me do this in a different color.

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:19.700
So we're gonna take away one one.

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:20.650
So let's take away one one.

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:25.439
And then we're gonna be left with six ones.

00:01:25.689 --> 00:01:27.582
Now let's go to the tens place.

00:01:27.582 --> 00:01:30.881
We start with five tens,

00:01:30.882 --> 00:01:33.575
but we're going to take away,

00:01:33.575 --> 00:01:35.736
we're going to subtract, five tens.

00:01:35.736 --> 00:01:38.424
So let's subtract one ten, two tens,

00:01:38.424 --> 00:01:40.877
three tens, four tens, five tens.

00:01:40.877 --> 00:01:42.604
We've taken all of the tens away.

00:01:42.605 --> 00:01:47.533
So now, we have zero tens.

00:01:47.683 --> 00:01:52.777
And then finally, we started with three hundreds

00:01:53.427 --> 00:01:56.500
but we want to take away two of them.

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:58.213
We want to take away two of the hundreds.

00:01:58.213 --> 00:01:59.533
So let's do that; let's take away

00:01:59.534 --> 00:02:01.738
one hundred and two hundred.

00:02:01.738 --> 00:02:02.929
And we're just going to be left

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:04.400
with this hundred right over here.

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:06.460
We're going to be left with one hundred.

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:08.820
Three hundreds minus two hundreds

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:10.638
is one hundred.

00:02:10.638 --> 00:02:12.842
So hopefully this gives you an appreciation

00:02:12.842 --> 00:02:14.982
of what's happening in place value.

00:02:14.982 --> 00:02:17.860
You could just say, "Oh, I'll line up the numbers,

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:19.821
"and I'll look at the place values, and then

00:02:19.821 --> 00:02:21.841
"over here I have a seven minus one is a six,

00:02:21.841 --> 00:02:23.431
"a five minus five is a zero,

00:02:23.431 --> 00:02:25.601
a three minus two is a one,"

00:02:25.601 --> 00:02:27.873
but I really want you to think about what's going on.

00:02:27.873 --> 00:02:30.597
This is seven ones minus one one,

00:02:30.598 --> 00:02:33.268
which gives us six ones;

00:02:33.268 --> 00:02:35.858
this is five tens minus five tens, so you're

00:02:35.858 --> 00:02:39.420
not gonna have any tens left over, so it's zero tens;

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:41.971
and three hundreds, three groups of a hundred,

00:02:41.972 --> 00:02:45.273
minus two groups of a hundred is gonna leave us

00:02:45.273 --> 00:02:48.640
only one group of a hundred.

00:02:48.304 --> 00:02:50.802
So we're gonna be left with 106:

00:02:50.802 --> 00:02:56.770
one hundred, zero tens, and six ones.
