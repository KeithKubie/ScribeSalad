00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
On today's lecture, we're going to cover value proposition.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
What is it you're building and for who?

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.000
What pains and gains are you creating for what customer segments?

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:16.000
And more importantly, what's the minimum viable product that results from all this knowledge?

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
So you're all familiar with the business model canvass and hopefully by now

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.000
you've actually taken a shot and tried to fill out the canvas for your own idea and your own startup.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.000
But today, we're going to talk about the first box, value proposition.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000
Value proposition is just a fancy word in the business model canvass

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
for what is it that you're building.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.000
What product or service are you building?

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.000
And by the way, we're going to ask later for who are you building it

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.000
and what exactly does it solve for those people?

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
So let's take a look at value proposition.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.000
As I said, it's not just about your idea or product.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:00.000
One of the things that's hard for founders to realize is there's actually a customer

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.000
at the other end and so while you're thinking this is the greatest thing since sliced bread

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.000
the whole idea about customer development is to get you out of the building

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
and tell me whose need or problem you're solving.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:19.000
It's about satisfying a customer need and not just you thinking what a great idea.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000
And that can't be repeated enough.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:29.000
So today, while we're talking about value proposition, value proposition works hand in hand

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.000
with who your customers are, which we'll be talking about in the next lecture.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:39.000
Understand that this relationship between what you're building, the value proposition,

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:44.000
and the customer is what makes startups succeed or fail on day one right there.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:49.000
And we give those two boxes, those two relationships, a special name.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.000
We call that product market fit.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:58.000
And when you hear the phrase product market fit, just simply visualize the canvass and go,

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:03.000
"Oh that's another fancy word that says is what I'm building needed or wanted

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:09.000
or passionately desired by a set of customers on the other end? And if I don't have that,

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.000
then the good news about the customer development process is it allows us

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:18.000
to keep searching without going out of business and so what you'll find is

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:23.000
we'll be iterating back and forth doing things called pivots and iterations

00:02:23.000 --> 99:59:59.000
as we kind of discover what customers really want versus what we think we're building for them.
