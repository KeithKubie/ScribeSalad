chapter three or four because you have

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:37.210
chapter three or four because you have
 

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:42.090

many students of Hispanic heritage in
 

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:44.520
many students of Hispanic heritage in
high schools and they will feel

is kind of a sociological argument based

00:01:59.520 --> 00:01:59.530
is kind of a sociological argument based
 

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:04.880
is kind of a sociological argument based
on what are perhaps incorrect

assumptions about student anticipation
 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:12.030
assumptions about student anticipation
then there's the idea that you should

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:12.040
then there's the idea that you should
 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:14.280
then there's the idea that you should
mention them that you should sort of

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:14.290
mention them that you should sort of
 

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:16.440
mention them that you should sort of
give the Western Hemisphere and the

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:16.450
give the Western Hemisphere and the
 

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:17.970
give the Western Hemisphere and the

as sort of a gestalt as a a big picture
where you start at the beginning you end

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:24.190
where you start at the beginning you end
 

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:26.670

up with the incas of the Aztecs and you

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:26.680
up with the incas of the Aztecs and you
 

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:29.220
up with the incas of the Aztecs and you
do it all at once but then the problem

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:29.230
do it all at once but then the problem
 

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:31.080
do it all at once but then the problem
with that just put that early in the

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:31.090
with that just put that early in the
 

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:33.420
with that just put that early in the
book and the Incas and the Aztecs are in

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:33.430
book and the Incas and the Aztecs are in
 

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:38.039
book and the Incas and the Aztecs are in
power when the Spaniards come circa 1500

00:02:38.049 --> 00:02:41.910
power when the Spaniards come circa 1500
AD then the chapter goes too far forward

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:41.920
AD then the chapter goes too far forward
 

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:45.410
AD then the chapter goes too far forward
and it's jumping the gun chronologically

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:45.420
and it's jumping the gun chronologically
 

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:50.490
and it's jumping the gun chronologically
so then a third option is to put the

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:50.500
so then a third option is to put the
 

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:54.270
so then a third option is to put the
stuff the broad portrayal of the Western

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:54.280
stuff the broad portrayal of the Western
 

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:56.729

Hemisphere just before the voyages of
 

00:02:56.739 --> 00:03:00.539
Hemisphere just before the voyages of
exploration so that you're prepared for

00:03:00.539 --> 00:03:00.549
exploration so that you're prepared for
 

00:03:00.549 --> 00:03:03.119
exploration so that you're prepared for
what the Spaniards and the Portuguese

00:03:03.119 --> 00:03:03.129
what the Spaniards and the Portuguese
 

00:03:03.129 --> 00:03:06.119
what the Spaniards and the Portuguese
will find when they get there and then

00:03:06.119 --> 00:03:06.129
will find when they get there and then
 

00:03:06.129 --> 00:03:08.220
will find when they get there and then
there's a fourth option which is to

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:08.230
there's a fourth option which is to
 

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:11.190
there's a fourth option which is to
divide the coverage into two or three

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:11.200
divide the coverage into two or three
 

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:14.520
divide the coverage into two or three
different chunks which is something that

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:14.530
different chunks which is something that
 

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:17.220
different chunks which is something that
teachers don't like because they prefer

to deal with large you know for the
 

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:24.740
to deal with large you know for the
fairly homogeneous chunks as opposed to

working on which I hope will end up
being the seed of a short book and it

00:03:48.659 --> 00:03:48.669
being the seed of a short book and it
 

00:03:48.669 --> 00:03:50.759
being the seed of a short book and it
deals with the question of where did

00:03:50.759 --> 00:03:50.769
deals with the question of where did
 

00:03:50.769 --> 00:03:52.740
deals with the question of where did
civilization began and when did

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:52.750
civilization began and when did
 

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:55.819
civilization began and when did
civilization begin and what was

00:03:55.819 --> 00:03:55.829
civilization begin and what was
 

00:03:55.829 --> 00:04:00.750

civilization when we approach this topic

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:00.760
civilization when we approach this topic
 

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:04.440

in every world history textbook that I

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:04.450
in every world history textbook that I
 

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:08.909
in every world history textbook that I
know of we say that civilization began

00:04:08.909 --> 00:04:08.919
know of we say that civilization began
 

00:04:08.919 --> 00:04:12.720

in the river valleys of Egypt and

in the river valleys of Egypt and
 

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:18.779
in the river valleys of Egypt and
Mesopotamia and we often throw in the

Mesopotamia and we often throw in the
 

00:04:18.789 --> 00:04:22.050

southern Pakistan although some people
 

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:27.899
southern Pakistan although some people
will put that in a in a separate chapter

00:04:27.899 --> 00:04:27.909
will put that in a in a separate chapter
 

00:04:27.909 --> 00:04:31.140
will put that in a in a separate chapter
but by and large civilization starts in

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:31.150
but by and large civilization starts in
 

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:31.530
but by and large civilization starts in
the

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:31.540
the
 

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:34.560

somewhere around 3500 BC although you

Neolithic communities that emerge as
civilizations and you also point out

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:53.050
civilizations and you also point out
 

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:56.820
civilizations and you also point out
that the earliest city that has been

they arrived in Australia by forty
 

00:07:52.419 --> 00:07:55.980
they arrived in Australia by forty
thousand years ago so it took ten

00:07:55.980 --> 00:07:55.990
thousand years ago so it took ten
 

00:07:55.990 --> 00:07:59.279
thousand years ago so it took ten
thousand years for them to get from East

00:07:59.279 --> 00:07:59.289
thousand years for them to get from East
 

00:07:59.289 --> 00:08:03.510
thousand years for them to get from East
Africa to Australia and about the same

00:08:03.510 --> 00:08:03.520
Africa to Australia and about the same
 

00:08:03.520 --> 00:08:05.059

20% of the distance between asked for
 

00:08:15.250 --> 00:08:19.019
20% of the distance between asked for

on sites are evidence that they put the
 

00:12:39.310 --> 00:12:43.130
on sites are evidence that they put the
stones in a wooden frame and used this

00:12:43.130 --> 00:12:43.140
stones in a wooden frame and used this

then we have evidence that wheat and

00:12:54.780 --> 00:12:54.790
then we have evidence that wheat and
 

00:12:54.790 --> 00:12:58.260
then we have evidence that wheat and
barley became domestic crops at roughly

00:12:58.260 --> 00:12:58.270
barley became domestic crops at roughly
 

00:12:58.270 --> 00:12:59.639

and we can tell what mutations were

00:13:02.100 --> 00:13:02.110
and we can tell what mutations were
 

00:13:02.110 --> 00:13:05.280

then you have further mutations after
 

00:13:13.990 --> 00:13:18.590
then you have further mutations after
that so we get the Neolithic stone tools

00:13:18.590 --> 00:13:18.600
that so we get the Neolithic stone tools
 

00:13:18.600 --> 00:13:23.269
that so we get the Neolithic stone tools
then we get the evidence of grain

00:13:23.269 --> 00:13:23.279
then we get the evidence of grain
 

00:13:23.279 --> 00:13:26.389
then we get the evidence of grain
cultivation domestication then we get

00:13:26.389 --> 00:13:26.399
cultivation domestication then we get
 

00:13:26.399 --> 00:13:29.850
cultivation domestication then we get
roughly simultaneously the evidence that

sheep and goats and cows are becoming
domestic and so we have the invention of

so it's a fairly small number of species

00:25:08.539 --> 00:25:08.549
so it's a fairly small number of species

you can eat that some might look like
 

00:25:26.700 --> 00:25:31.549
you can eat that some might look like
the old plants but then you you you eat

Australia so fast and the answer almost
 

00:27:07.710 --> 00:27:09.620
Australia so fast and the answer almost
certainly is that they followed the

00:27:09.620 --> 00:27:09.630
certainly is that they followed the
 

00:27:09.630 --> 00:27:14.930
certainly is that they followed the
coastline at that time the sea level was

00:27:14.930 --> 00:27:14.940
coastline at that time the sea level was
 

00:27:14.940 --> 00:27:19.940
coastline at that time the sea level was
about 400 feet lower than it is now as a

00:27:19.940 --> 00:27:19.950
about 400 feet lower than it is now as a
 

00:27:19.950 --> 00:27:24.260
about 400 feet lower than it is now as a
result you could go from East Africa all

00:27:24.260 --> 00:27:24.270
result you could go from East Africa all
 

00:27:24.270 --> 00:27:27.290
result you could go from East Africa all
the way to Borneo and only have to cross

00:27:27.290 --> 00:27:27.300
the way to Borneo and only have to cross
 

00:27:27.300 --> 00:27:29.690
the way to Borneo and only have to cross
one body of salt water there's a very

00:27:29.690 --> 00:27:29.700
one body of salt water there's a very
 

00:27:29.700 --> 00:27:33.470
one body of salt water there's a very
narrow strait between Yemen and Africa

00:27:33.470 --> 00:27:33.480
narrow strait between Yemen and Africa
 

00:27:33.480 --> 00:27:36.200
narrow strait between Yemen and Africa
that is still there it's bigger now and

00:27:36.200 --> 00:27:36.210
that is still there it's bigger now and
 

00:27:36.210 --> 00:27:38.150
that is still there it's bigger now and
you would have to cross that but

00:27:38.150 --> 00:27:38.160
you would have to cross that but
 

00:27:38.160 --> 00:27:40.850
you would have to cross that but
otherwise you could simply walk along

00:27:40.850 --> 00:27:40.860
otherwise you could simply walk along
 

00:27:40.860 --> 00:27:47.150
otherwise you could simply walk along
the coast from Somalia to Borneo without

00:27:47.150 --> 00:27:47.160
the coast from Somalia to Borneo without
 

00:27:47.160 --> 00:27:48.830
the coast from Somalia to Borneo without
having to cross the nice hot water then

00:27:48.830 --> 00:27:48.840
having to cross the nice hot water then
 

00:27:48.840 --> 00:27:51.020
having to cross the nice hot water then
when he got to Borneo you would have to

00:27:51.020 --> 00:27:51.030
when he got to Borneo you would have to
 

00:27:51.030 --> 00:27:52.940
when he got to Borneo you would have to
cross another body of water in order to

00:27:52.940 --> 00:27:52.950
cross another body of water in order to
 

00:27:52.950 --> 00:27:55.610
cross another body of water in order to
get to Australia so certainly there was

00:27:55.610 --> 00:27:55.620
get to Australia so certainly there was
 

00:27:55.620 --> 00:27:58.130
get to Australia so certainly there was
some water that was crossed but at that

00:27:58.130 --> 00:27:58.140
some water that was crossed but at that
 

00:27:58.140 --> 00:28:01.790
some water that was crossed but at that
time Southeast Asia was a subcontinent

00:28:01.790 --> 00:28:01.800
time Southeast Asia was a subcontinent
 

00:28:01.800 --> 00:28:03.830
time Southeast Asia was a subcontinent
all the islands of Indonesia the

00:28:03.830 --> 00:28:03.840
all the islands of Indonesia the
 

00:28:03.840 --> 00:28:04.880
all the islands of Indonesia the
Philippines they're all

00:28:04.880 --> 00:28:04.890
Philippines they're all
 

00:28:04.890 --> 00:28:07.010
Philippines they're all
connected by dry land it was just a

00:28:07.010 --> 00:28:07.020
connected by dry land it was just a
 

00:28:07.020 --> 00:28:09.919
connected by dry land it was just a
subcontinent and Australia and New

00:28:09.919 --> 00:28:09.929
subcontinent and Australia and New
 

00:28:09.929 --> 00:28:15.169
subcontinent and Australia and New
Guinea were a whole continent if humans

00:28:15.169 --> 00:28:15.179
Guinea were a whole continent if humans
 

00:28:15.179 --> 00:28:18.580
Guinea were a whole continent if humans
followed the coastline followed the fish

00:28:18.580 --> 00:28:18.590
followed the coastline followed the fish
 

00:28:18.590 --> 00:28:22.340
followed the coastline followed the fish
all the way to Australia it would leave

00:28:22.340 --> 00:28:22.350
all the way to Australia it would leave
 

00:28:22.350 --> 00:28:26.240
all the way to Australia it would leave
virtually no trace because once the ice

00:28:26.240 --> 00:28:26.250
virtually no trace because once the ice
 

00:28:26.250 --> 00:28:28.789
virtually no trace because once the ice
age ended and the sea level level rose

00:28:28.789 --> 00:28:28.799
age ended and the sea level level rose
 

00:28:28.799 --> 00:28:32.930
age ended and the sea level level rose
again the whole coastal areas were

00:28:32.930 --> 00:28:32.940
again the whole coastal areas were
 

00:28:32.940 --> 00:28:35.330
again the whole coastal areas were
flooded so any archaeological remains

00:28:35.330 --> 00:28:35.340
flooded so any archaeological remains
 

00:28:35.340 --> 00:28:38.000
flooded so any archaeological remains
are now underwater for example the

00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:38.010
are now underwater for example the
 

00:28:38.010 --> 00:28:41.930
are now underwater for example the
entire Persian Gulf was dry land at that

00:28:41.930 --> 00:28:41.940
entire Persian Gulf was dry land at that
 

00:28:41.940 --> 00:28:46.360
entire Persian Gulf was dry land at that
time and archaeologists now assume that

00:28:46.360 --> 00:28:46.370
time and archaeologists now assume that
 

00:28:46.370 --> 00:28:49.039
time and archaeologists now assume that
early human habitation in that area is

00:28:49.039 --> 00:28:49.049
early human habitation in that area is
 

00:28:49.049 --> 00:28:52.570
early human habitation in that area is
under water it's in the Persian Gulf

00:28:52.570 --> 00:28:52.580
under water it's in the Persian Gulf
 

00:28:52.580 --> 00:28:56.330
under water it's in the Persian Gulf
so we have very hard time proving that

00:28:56.330 --> 00:28:56.340
so we have very hard time proving that
 

00:28:56.340 --> 00:29:01.390
so we have very hard time proving that
that was the way people traveled and yet

00:29:01.390 --> 00:29:01.400
that was the way people traveled and yet
 

00:29:01.400 --> 00:29:05.480
that was the way people traveled and yet
there is a new scientific technique that

00:29:05.480 --> 00:29:05.490
there is a new scientific technique that
 

00:29:05.490 --> 00:29:08.960
there is a new scientific technique that
has been adopted to test this sort of

00:29:08.960 --> 00:29:08.970
has been adopted to test this sort of
 

00:29:08.970 --> 00:29:14.299
has been adopted to test this sort of
hypothesis this has to do with the

00:29:14.299 --> 00:29:14.309
hypothesis this has to do with the
 

00:29:14.309 --> 00:29:17.930
hypothesis this has to do with the
analysis of an isotope of two isotopes

00:29:17.930 --> 00:29:17.940
analysis of an isotope of two isotopes
 

00:29:17.940 --> 00:29:24.250
analysis of an isotope of two isotopes
of nitrogen isotope 14 an isotope 15

00:29:24.250 --> 00:29:24.260
 
 

00:29:24.260 --> 00:29:26.840
 
nitrogen only has two stable isotopes

00:29:26.840 --> 00:29:26.850
nitrogen only has two stable isotopes
 

00:29:26.850 --> 00:29:31.669
nitrogen only has two stable isotopes
and so nitrogen 14 and nitrogen 15 show

00:29:31.669 --> 00:29:31.679
and so nitrogen 14 and nitrogen 15 show
 

00:29:31.679 --> 00:29:34.520
and so nitrogen 14 and nitrogen 15 show
up together in the atmosphere they show

00:29:34.520 --> 00:29:34.530
up together in the atmosphere they show
 

00:29:34.530 --> 00:29:37.580
up together in the atmosphere they show
up together in plants that are capable

00:29:37.580 --> 00:29:37.590
up together in plants that are capable
 

00:29:37.590 --> 00:29:41.840
up together in plants that are capable
of binding nitrogen or bacteria that are

00:29:41.840 --> 00:29:41.850
of binding nitrogen or bacteria that are
 

00:29:41.850 --> 00:29:44.330
of binding nitrogen or bacteria that are
capable of binding nitrogen that is say

00:29:44.330 --> 00:29:44.340
capable of binding nitrogen that is say
 

00:29:44.340 --> 00:29:47.060
capable of binding nitrogen that is say
taking nitrogen out of the air or out of

an animal could but by and large this is
what plants do is that they take

00:30:03.590 --> 00:30:03.600
what plants do is that they take
 

00:30:03.600 --> 00:30:06.760
what plants do is that they take
nitrogen out of the atmosphere and

00:30:06.760 --> 00:30:06.770
nitrogen out of the atmosphere and
 

00:30:06.770 --> 00:30:09.680
nitrogen out of the atmosphere and
whatever nitrogen ends up in human

nitrogen 15 in a given area is
 

00:30:24.270 --> 00:30:26.700
nitrogen 15 in a given area is
considered to be pretty much a constant

now to say the ratio and the atmosphere
 

00:30:28.920 --> 00:30:31.260
now to say the ratio and the atmosphere
whether it's always been a constant is

00:30:31.260 --> 00:30:31.270
whether it's always been a constant is
 

00:30:31.270 --> 00:30:33.240
whether it's always been a constant is
hard to tell but it's generally assumed

00:30:33.240 --> 00:30:33.250
hard to tell but it's generally assumed
 

00:30:33.250 --> 00:30:38.220
hard to tell but it's generally assumed
that this is been a constant component

00:30:38.220 --> 00:30:38.230
that this is been a constant component
 

00:30:38.230 --> 00:30:46.950

say let us say the plants have a level
 

00:31:23.920 --> 00:31:28.800
say let us say the plants have a level
of 6 then you say well but the cows have

00:31:28.800 --> 00:31:28.810
of 6 then you say well but the cows have
 

00:31:28.810 --> 00:31:31.590
of 6 then you say well but the cows have
a level of 11 because they retain more

00:31:31.590 --> 00:31:31.600
a level of 11 because they retain more
 

00:31:31.600 --> 00:31:34.530
a level of 11 because they retain more
nitrogen 15 than the plants do then you

00:31:34.530 --> 00:31:34.540
nitrogen 15 than the plants do then you
 

00:31:34.540 --> 00:31:37.160
nitrogen 15 than the plants do then you
look at the lions that eat the cows and

00:31:37.160 --> 00:31:37.170
look at the lions that eat the cows and
 

00:31:37.170 --> 00:31:41.130
look at the lions that eat the cows and
you say well that's the next in a food

00:31:41.130 --> 00:31:41.140
you say well that's the next in a food
 

00:31:41.140 --> 00:31:45.870
you say well that's the next in a food
chain each level it's called a trophic

chain each level it's called a trophic
 

00:31:45.880 --> 00:31:51.960
chain each level it's called a trophic
level so that cows eat plants lions eat

00:31:51.960 --> 00:31:51.970
level so that cows eat plants lions eat
 

00:31:51.970 --> 00:31:56.090
level so that cows eat plants lions eat
cows those are different trophic levels

00:31:56.090 --> 00:31:56.100
cows those are different trophic levels
 

00:31:56.100 --> 00:31:58.890

autotrophic refers to from a Greek root

00:31:58.890 --> 00:31:58.900
autotrophic refers to from a Greek root
 

00:31:58.900 --> 00:32:02.730
autotrophic refers to from a Greek root
meaning food

00:32:02.740 --> 00:32:05.159
 
so then you'll find that if the if the

00:32:05.159 --> 00:32:05.169
so then you'll find that if the if the
 

00:32:05.169 --> 00:32:07.830
so then you'll find that if the if the
plants were six and the cows were eleven

00:32:07.830 --> 00:32:07.840
plants were six and the cows were eleven
 

00:32:07.840 --> 00:32:12.149
plants were six and the cows were eleven
the Lions will be 14 they'll have more

the Lions will be 14 they'll have more
 

00:32:12.159 --> 00:32:15.000
the Lions will be 14 they'll have more
nitrogen 15 than the cows who in turn

that is to say there are big fish eat

00:32:34.769 --> 00:32:34.779
that is to say there are big fish eat
 

00:32:34.779 --> 00:32:36.779
that is to say there are big fish eat
smaller fish which eat smaller fish with

00:32:36.779 --> 00:32:36.789
smaller fish which eat smaller fish with
 

00:32:36.789 --> 00:32:38.940
smaller fish which eat smaller fish with
each which he meets fuller at smaller

00:32:38.940 --> 00:32:38.950

where you have phytoplankton or

00:32:46.320 --> 00:32:46.330
where you have phytoplankton or

where you have phytoplankton or
something like that being consumed so it

00:32:49.169 --> 00:32:49.179
something like that being consumed so it
 

00:32:49.179 --> 00:32:51.000
something like that being consumed so it
turns out that the highest levels of

00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:51.010
turns out that the highest levels of
 

00:32:51.010 --> 00:32:55.200
turns out that the highest levels of
nitrogen 15 are in the fish particularly

00:32:55.200 --> 00:32:55.210
nitrogen 15 are in the fish particularly
 

00:32:55.210 --> 00:32:58.440
nitrogen 15 are in the fish particularly
in those fish that are at the top of the

00:32:58.440 --> 00:32:58.450
in those fish that are at the top of the
 

00:32:58.450 --> 00:33:01.470
in those fish that are at the top of the
food chain the same fish for example

00:33:01.470 --> 00:33:01.480
food chain the same fish for example
 

00:33:01.480 --> 00:33:03.870

same reasons that they're the at the top
 

00:33:06.370 --> 00:33:13.500
same reasons that they're the at the top
of the trophic tree so let us say you

00:33:13.500 --> 00:33:13.510
of the trophic tree so let us say you
 

00:33:13.510 --> 00:33:18.240
of the trophic tree so let us say you
take from an archeological site you take

00:33:18.240 --> 00:33:18.250
take from an archeological site you take
 

00:33:18.250 --> 00:33:22.980
take from an archeological site you take
some sheep bones let's say domestic

00:33:22.980 --> 00:33:22.990
some sheep bones let's say domestic
 

00:33:22.990 --> 00:33:26.490
some sheep bones let's say domestic
sheep you'll figure humans eat the Sheep

00:33:26.490 --> 00:33:26.500
sheep you'll figure humans eat the Sheep
 

00:33:26.500 --> 00:33:29.090
sheep you'll figure humans eat the Sheep
and then you take some human bones and

00:33:29.090 --> 00:33:29.100
and then you take some human bones and
 

00:33:29.100 --> 00:33:32.940
and then you take some human bones and
you compare with the nitrogen levels do

00:33:32.940 --> 00:33:32.950
you compare with the nitrogen levels do
 

00:33:32.950 --> 00:33:35.100
you compare with the nitrogen levels do
the humans have the same nitrogen level

00:33:35.100 --> 00:33:35.110
the humans have the same nitrogen level
 

00:33:35.110 --> 00:33:39.090
the humans have the same nitrogen level
as the Sheep probably not there'll be a

00:33:39.090 --> 00:33:39.100
as the Sheep probably not there'll be a
 

00:33:39.100 --> 00:33:42.149
as the Sheep probably not there'll be a
little more cuz there they're eating the

00:33:42.149 --> 00:33:42.159
little more cuz there they're eating the
 

00:33:42.159 --> 00:33:44.029
little more cuz there they're eating the
sheep but they're also eating vegetables

00:33:44.029 --> 00:33:44.039
sheep but they're also eating vegetables
 

00:33:44.039 --> 00:33:47.130
sheep but they're also eating vegetables
but if they have a lot more nitrogen it

00:33:47.130 --> 00:33:47.140
but if they have a lot more nitrogen it
 

00:33:47.140 --> 00:33:49.220
but if they have a lot more nitrogen it
means they're eating a lot of fish and

00:33:49.220 --> 00:33:49.230
means they're eating a lot of fish and
 

00:33:49.230 --> 00:33:53.460
means they're eating a lot of fish and

at the nitrogen levels you'll find out

00:34:26.129 --> 00:34:26.139
at the nitrogen levels you'll find out
 

00:34:26.139 --> 00:34:28.379
at the nitrogen levels you'll find out
that even though the people living there

00:34:28.379 --> 00:34:28.389
that even though the people living there
 

00:34:28.389 --> 00:34:31.500
that even though the people living there
were herders and even though they had

00:34:31.500 --> 00:34:31.510
were herders and even though they had
 

00:34:31.510 --> 00:34:33.780

this is where people were getting their
food and why well it's awful lot easier

00:34:57.390 --> 00:34:57.400

look lionfish you know so we don't know
 

00:35:29.549 --> 00:35:33.240

thousand years to Australia also went up

00:35:42.539 --> 00:35:42.549
thousand years to Australia also went up
 

00:35:42.549 --> 00:35:47.339
thousand years to Australia also went up
the coast of Asia to Siberia and crossed

00:35:47.339 --> 00:35:47.349
the coast of Asia to Siberia and crossed
 

00:35:47.349 --> 00:35:51.240
the coast of Asia to Siberia and crossed
over into Alaska somewhere say between

they're following the coast and cold
waters have abundant fish resources so

00:36:04.530 --> 00:36:04.540
waters have abundant fish resources so
 

00:36:04.540 --> 00:36:08.010
waters have abundant fish resources so
they probably were not crossing from

00:36:08.010 --> 00:36:08.020
they probably were not crossing from
 

00:36:08.020 --> 00:36:12.740
they probably were not crossing from
Siberia to Alaska chasing reindeer or

00:36:12.740 --> 00:36:12.750
 
 

00:36:12.750 --> 00:36:15.539
 
hunting for seals they're probably

00:36:15.539 --> 00:36:15.549
hunting for seals they're probably
 

00:36:15.549 --> 00:36:17.670
hunting for seals they're probably
following the fish along the coast and

00:36:17.670 --> 00:36:17.680
following the fish along the coast and
 

00:36:17.680 --> 00:36:21.720
following the fish along the coast and
once they got to North America well hey

00:36:21.720 --> 00:36:21.730
once they got to North America well hey
 

00:36:21.730 --> 00:36:24.599
once they got to North America well hey
just go down the Pacific Coast pretty

00:36:24.599 --> 00:36:24.609
just go down the Pacific Coast pretty
 

00:36:24.609 --> 00:36:27.079
just go down the Pacific Coast pretty
soon you're in prime salmon territory

00:36:27.079 --> 00:36:27.089

the Canadians have salmon too but you
 

00:36:38.350 --> 00:36:40.320
the Canadians have salmon too but you
never hear about it then you get down

00:36:40.320 --> 00:36:40.330
never hear about it then you get down

but this is the great fishery and that

00:37:06.990 --> 00:37:07.000
but this is the great fishery and that

is where people ended up despite the
 

00:37:11.230 --> 00:37:14.480
is where people ended up despite the
fact that the land on the coast of Peru

theory people were more interested in

00:37:26.370 --> 00:37:26.380
theory people were more interested in
 

00:37:26.380 --> 00:37:28.860
theory people were more interested in
eating the fish so some of them are

00:37:28.860 --> 00:37:28.870
eating the fish so some of them are
 

00:37:28.870 --> 00:37:30.450
eating the fish so some of them are
going inland and hunting other animals
