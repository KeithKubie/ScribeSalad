MARTIN OMANDER: My guest
today is Joe Born, co-founder

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:09.172
of the startup responsible for
the Hale Dreamer alarm clock.

00:00:09.172 --> 00:00:10.630
Joe, thanks for
coming on the show.

00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:12.230
Would you tell us a
bit about your startup?

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:13.230
JOE BORN: Thanks for having me.

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:14.813
So yeah, we're a
hardware company that

00:00:14.813 --> 00:00:18.610
was started to support the
underserved Android accessory

00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:22.310
market, particularly on speaker
docks and nightstand docks.

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:25.580
So we released the first
speaker dock for Android plug-in

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:26.850
with a remote control.

00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:29.470
And we released
the Hale Dreamer.

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:32.479
So a nightstand dock
with a smart silence,

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:35.460
do not disturb feature,
and a working snooze bar.

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:37.290
And we recently
became [? Iowa ?] USA,

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:39.300
so there will be lots of
announcements coming up

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:39.860
with that.

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:40.600
MARTIN OMANDER: Oh, cool.

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:41.266
Congratulations.

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:46.180
So how can a domestic hardware
startup like yourselves

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:49.192
compete with overseas
commoditized hardware?

00:00:49.192 --> 00:00:50.900
JOE BORN: Yeah, so
it's a great question.

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:52.800
My biggest piece
of advice is don't

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.720
compete with
commoditized hardware.

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:57.640
Add your value on top of
that commoditized hardware.

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:00.240
And then leverage
that supply chain

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:03.140
so that you're adding value
and not getting too bogged down

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:05.047
in the details of the
hardware and competing

00:01:05.047 --> 00:01:07.380
with the commoditized side
of the hardware, if you will.

00:01:08.311 --> 00:01:09.810
MARTIN OMANDER: So
are you following

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:11.910
your own advice for this device?

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:14.160
JOE BORN: Yeah, so if you
look at this from a hardware

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:18.460
perspective, this is largely
an average commoditized speaker

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:19.210
dock, if you will.

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:22.650
It has got great sound and
buttons and charges your phone.

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:25.610
But the real value added, what's
really unique is in the app.

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:29.950
So the app has this
included alarm clock app

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:31.850
that actually silences
your phone at night

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:32.560
with smart sound.

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:35.590
So at a touch of a button
all your notifications

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:36.180
are silenced.

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.070
It can even reach back
to callers and say,

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:39.050
is this an emergency?

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:41.530
If they say yes, then it rings.

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:43.110
All that stuff is in software.

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:46.949
And so we really
did stub out a lot

00:01:46.949 --> 00:01:48.240
of the details of the hardware.

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.662
Now in this case, it's
not just a sensor.

00:01:50.662 --> 00:01:52.370
The speaker quality
was really important.

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:54.060
So we had to get
kind of more involved

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:56.987
than potentially some other
app with sensor app wrapped

00:01:56.987 --> 00:01:58.230
in plastic might have to.

00:01:58.230 --> 00:02:02.090
But we definitely leveraged
a factory and their expertise

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:03.520
to get this product to market.

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:05.790
And we didn't put
huge investments

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:08.614
on just the commoditized side
of the hardware, if you will.

00:02:08.614 --> 00:02:10.280
MARTIN OMANDER: Tell
me more about that.

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:14.370
You said you leveraged
the factory's expertise.

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:17.850
So you are not just using
any old factory out there.

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:21.619
You go for specific
hardware partners?

00:02:21.619 --> 00:02:22.160
Tell me more.

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:23.470
JOE BORN: Yeah, that's right.

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:25.540
The factory, for example,
that produces this,

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:29.490
supplies some very big-name
tier one acoustic manufacturers.

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:32.700
So a lot of acoustic expertise.

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:35.410
A lot of acoustic
equipment that they

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:36.990
bring to bear on our products.

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:40.250
And in fact, our
manufacturing arrangement

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:43.360
is much more of a partnership
than just a straight contract

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:44.830
manufacturing sourcing.

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:46.820
And the reason we do
that is because we do

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:51.550
get to leverage so much of that
expertise and the resources

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:52.540
that they have.

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:54.350
And that allows us to
focus on the things

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:56.240
that we really feel
we're adding values.

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:59.400
The details of this app, the
user experience, the design,

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:01.390
the things that really
touch consumers.

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:05.510
And that focus is what
allows us to do well at that.

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:08.960
MARTIN OMANDER: So then
does that mean you actually

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:11.600
have to pitch your product
not just to investors

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:13.610
and consumers, but to
hardware partners as well?

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:14.790
JOE BORN: Yeah, absolutely.

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:16.331
I mean, most of the
factories that we

00:03:16.331 --> 00:03:19.710
work with are full-service
factories that really

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:22.410
are seeking high-volume
successful products.

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:24.510
They don't make money
from design fees.

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:27.510
They don't make money
just from upfront stuff.

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:29.880
They really make money by
having successful products.

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:32.420
And so it's our job
to convince them

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:34.480
we have a winner with
this product concept.

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:36.390
And you should work
with us and partner.

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:40.130
And bring your resources
to bear and help us

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:42.190
so that we'll have a
successful product together.

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:43.100
We'll all make money.

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:47.390
There are whole categories of
factories that work that way.

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:48.510
MARTIN OMANDER: Really?

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:49.780
So you've been in hardware.

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:52.510
You have 20 years of
hardware experience.

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:55.260
How have you seen the hardware
field change in that time, Joe?

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:57.850
JOE BORN: It's
absolutely night and day.

00:03:57.850 --> 00:04:00.360
To the extent that my
experience of a decade

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:01.616
ago is almost irrelevant.

00:04:01.616 --> 00:04:03.240
And I would counsel
any of your viewers

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:05.531
to be very careful who they're
getting experience from.

00:04:05.531 --> 00:04:09.780
Because if it's old,
it's much less relevant.

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:12.032
We have seen barriers
drop from what

00:04:12.032 --> 00:04:13.990
cost us millions of
dollars to bring a hardware

00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:16.370
product to market
even 10 years ago

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:19.029
to what's almost nothing today.

00:04:19.029 --> 00:04:21.740
We used to have to do all this
engineering work ourselves.

00:04:21.740 --> 00:04:23.130
Hardware, electrical.

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:26.230
And today you can put
together components

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:29.430
from Arduino, Raspberry Pi,
all this off-the-shelf hardware

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:31.590
and software that
allows you to assemble

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:34.590
a product in a fraction, a
real fraction of the time it

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:35.700
used to cost.

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:37.400
And then on the
sales side, you've

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:40.490
now got all these self-service
marketplaces like Amazon

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:42.320
and eBay and so on and so forth.

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:43.320
And crowd funding.

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:44.890
Whereas it used to
be all big brick

00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:46.590
and mortar national retailers.

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:48.690
Altogether the barriers
to entry have dropped so

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:50.730
precipitously as a
result of those factors

00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:52.422
that there really
is no comparison.

00:04:52.422 --> 00:04:53.380
MARTIN OMANDER: Really?

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:55.490
So how are you
using those trends

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:57.040
to your advantage
for your startup?

00:04:57.902 --> 00:04:59.610
JOE BORN: Well, we
certainly put together

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:03.090
the prototype using Arduino
and off-the-shelf speakers.

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:05.580
And that got us in front
of consumers and customers

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:08.750
much, much earlier than
we would have previously.

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:10.580
And then we did do a
crowdfunding campaign

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:13.560
to get feedback from the market
even before the product was

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:14.400
in production.

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:17.230
So we're using a lot of
those tools to our advantage

00:05:17.230 --> 00:05:18.990
just like any other
startup should.

00:05:20.846 --> 00:05:22.220
MARTIN OMANDER:
So are we looking

00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:24.632
at a piece of Arduino
technology here?

00:05:24.632 --> 00:05:25.340
JOE BORN: It was.

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:27.440
The original prototypes
were made that way.

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:31.100
We actually did shift to an
even lower cost microprocessor

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:34.090
because pennies do matter when
you get into mass production.

00:05:34.090 --> 00:05:37.500
And another thing is that,
again, working with the factory

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:39.550
and they're leveraging
your supply chain,

00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:41.820
managing your parts,
it's good to have parts

00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:43.620
that they're familiar
with, relationships

00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:45.410
that they have with
microprocessors.

00:05:45.410 --> 00:05:48.460
Many of these silicon parts
have 16-week lead times.

00:05:49.622 --> 00:05:51.080
So if you're working
with something

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:53.205
that they're familiar with
and a distribution chain

00:05:53.205 --> 00:05:54.910
they're familiar
with, it's much easier

00:05:54.910 --> 00:05:58.304
to get flexibility out of it
than if it's an unknown silicon

00:05:58.304 --> 00:05:59.220
supplier, for example.

00:06:00.530 --> 00:06:02.400
MARTIN OMANDER: So
yet another reason

00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:05.070
to pick your hardware
partner with care

00:06:05.070 --> 00:06:06.845
and make them a partner
rather than just

00:06:06.845 --> 00:06:07.986
a manufacturer for you.

00:06:07.986 --> 00:06:08.860
JOE BORN: Absolutely.

00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:11.254
I mean, their ability to
apply financial resources,

00:06:11.254 --> 00:06:12.920
their ability to apply
the relationships

00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:14.560
are all crucial to things.

00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:16.780
Imagine a new product
with an unknown demand

00:06:16.780 --> 00:06:19.000
managing a four-month
lead time on it.

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:20.130
Virtually impossible.

00:06:20.130 --> 00:06:22.340
So your factory really
can facilitate things

00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:25.100
like that if you work with
them properly and choose

00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:27.090
the right partners, you see.

00:06:27.090 --> 00:06:29.570
MARTIN OMANDER: So is your
advice to other hardware

00:06:29.570 --> 00:06:33.020
startups to use
Arduino, Raspberry Pi,

00:06:33.020 --> 00:06:35.610
that sort of ready-made
technology for the prototype?

00:06:35.610 --> 00:06:38.020
And then in
production, move over

00:06:38.020 --> 00:06:40.676
to cheaper hardware
like you did?

00:06:40.676 --> 00:06:41.550
JOE BORN: Absolutely.

00:06:41.550 --> 00:06:44.180
And the other piece of
advice I'd give-- if you can,

00:06:44.180 --> 00:06:45.480
use standard interfaces.

00:06:45.480 --> 00:06:47.050
So we had a
proprietary interface

00:06:47.050 --> 00:06:49.130
because we wanted a plug-in
dock and the details

00:06:49.130 --> 00:06:50.200
of our implementation.

00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:52.699
But if you can use something
that's cleaner like a Bluetooth

00:06:52.699 --> 00:06:55.040
low energy, it makes
it that much easier

00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:57.060
to manage the factory
at a high level.

00:06:57.060 --> 00:06:59.530
So I don't need to know
all the details of what's

00:06:59.530 --> 00:07:01.540
under the hood on my
pedometer, my scale,

00:07:01.540 --> 00:07:03.852
or whatever it might be,
because the interface

00:07:03.852 --> 00:07:05.420
is so well established.

00:07:05.420 --> 00:07:08.010
And that, again, allows
you to give the factory

00:07:08.010 --> 00:07:10.577
the flexibility to do their
thing under the hood, which

00:07:10.577 --> 00:07:12.910
helps them manage their supply
chain and their inventory

00:07:12.910 --> 00:07:15.000
costs, and their
engineering time,

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:16.134
and all that kind of stuff.

00:07:16.134 --> 00:07:17.050
MARTIN OMANDER: Great.

00:07:18.420 --> 00:07:19.020
Very good.

00:07:19.020 --> 00:07:20.910
Thank you so much for
coming on the show

00:07:20.910 --> 00:07:22.760
and sharing your
experiences with us, Joe.

00:07:22.760 --> 00:07:23.400
JOE BORN: Absolutely.

00:07:23.400 --> 00:07:24.310
Thanks for having me.

00:07:24.310 --> 00:07:26.101
MARTIN OMANDER: We hope
you found something
