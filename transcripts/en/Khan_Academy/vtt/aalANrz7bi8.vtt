00:00:00.528 --> 00:00:01.369
- [Voiceover] So we started

00:00:01.369 --> 00:00:02.506
with a square wave

00:00:02.506 --> 00:00:04.239
that had a period of two pi,

00:00:04.239 --> 00:00:05.524
then we said, hmm,

00:00:05.524 --> 00:00:07.146
can we represent it

00:00:07.146 --> 00:00:09.545
as an infinite series

00:00:09.545 --> 00:00:11.877
of weighted sines and cosines,

00:00:11.877 --> 00:00:14.487
and then working from that idea,

00:00:14.487 --> 00:00:15.320
we were actually able

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:16.767
to find expressions

00:00:16.767 --> 00:00:17.908
for the coefficients,

00:00:17.908 --> 00:00:19.795
for a sub zero and a sub n

00:00:19.795 --> 00:00:21.092
when n does not equal zero,

00:00:21.092 --> 00:00:22.472
and the b sub ns.

00:00:22.472 --> 00:00:23.723
And evaluating it for this

00:00:23.723 --> 00:00:25.295
particular square wave,

00:00:25.295 --> 00:00:26.128
we were able to get

00:00:26.128 --> 00:00:27.341
that a sub n is going

00:00:27.341 --> 00:00:28.307
to be equal,

00:00:28.307 --> 00:00:29.467
or a sub zero is going

00:00:29.467 --> 00:00:30.926
to be 3/2,

00:00:30.926 --> 00:00:31.759
that a sub n is going

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:32.730
to be equal to zero

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:33.963
for any n

00:00:33.963 --> 00:00:35.664
other than zero,

00:00:35.664 --> 00:00:37.036
and that b sub n

00:00:37.036 --> 00:00:39.105
is going to be equal

00:00:39.105 --> 00:00:41.587
to zero if n is even

00:00:41.587 --> 00:00:43.109
and six over n pi

00:00:43.109 --> 00:00:44.109
if n is odd.

00:00:45.343 --> 00:00:46.306
So one way to think about it,

00:00:46.306 --> 00:00:49.804
you're gonna get your a sub zero,

00:00:49.804 --> 00:00:50.637
you're not gonna have any

00:00:50.637 --> 00:00:52.048
of the cosine terms,

00:00:52.048 --> 00:00:53.189
and you're only going to have

00:00:53.189 --> 00:00:54.772
the odd sine terms.

00:00:55.844 --> 00:00:56.852
And if you think about it

00:00:56.852 --> 00:00:57.885
just visually, if you look

00:00:57.885 --> 00:00:59.039
at the square wave,

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:00.088
it makes sense

00:01:00.088 --> 00:01:01.213
that you're gonna have

00:01:01.213 --> 00:01:03.205
the sines and not the cosines

00:01:03.205 --> 00:01:04.857
because a sine function

00:01:04.857 --> 00:01:07.573
is gonna look something like this.

00:01:07.573 --> 00:01:10.132
So a sine function is gonna look

00:01:10.132 --> 00:01:11.696
something like this,

00:01:11.696 --> 00:01:12.869
while a cosine function

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:14.619
looks something like,

00:01:17.052 --> 00:01:19.360
let me make it a little bit neater,

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:20.731
a cosine function would look

00:01:20.731 --> 00:01:22.398
something like that.

00:01:25.054 --> 00:01:26.317
And so a cosine

00:01:26.317 --> 00:01:28.226
and multiples of cosine

00:01:28.226 --> 00:01:30.910
of two x, cosine of three x,

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:32.185
is gonna be out of phase,

00:01:32.185 --> 00:01:33.501
while the sine of x,

00:01:33.501 --> 00:01:35.071
or I should say cosine of ts

00:01:35.071 --> 00:01:36.457
and the sines of ts,

00:01:36.457 --> 00:01:38.082
sine two t, sine three t,

00:01:38.082 --> 00:01:39.310
is gonna be more in phase

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:40.417
with the way this function

00:01:40.417 --> 00:01:41.764
just happened to be.

00:01:41.764 --> 00:01:43.875
So it made sense that our

00:01:43.875 --> 00:01:45.758
a sub ns were all zero

00:01:45.758 --> 00:01:48.066
for n not equaling zero.

00:01:48.066 --> 00:01:50.044
And so based on what we found

00:01:50.044 --> 00:01:51.409
for our a sub zero,

00:01:51.409 --> 00:01:52.242
and our a sub ns,

00:01:52.242 --> 00:01:53.662
and our b sub ns,

00:01:53.662 --> 00:01:54.758
we could expand out

00:01:54.758 --> 00:01:56.445
this actual,

00:01:56.445 --> 00:01:58.018
we did in the previous video,

00:01:58.018 --> 00:01:59.212
what is this Fourier series

00:01:59.212 --> 00:02:00.247
actually look like?

00:02:00.247 --> 00:02:01.779
So 3/2 plus six over pi

00:02:01.779 --> 00:02:04.255
sine of t plus six over three pi

00:02:04.255 --> 00:02:05.127
sine of three t plus

00:02:05.127 --> 00:02:05.960
six over five pi

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:07.111
sine of five t,

00:02:07.111 --> 00:02:08.532
and so on and so forth.

00:02:08.532 --> 00:02:09.365
And so a lot of you might

00:02:09.365 --> 00:02:10.198
be curious what does this

00:02:10.198 --> 00:02:11.831
actually look like.

00:02:11.831 --> 00:02:13.011
And so I actually just,

00:02:13.011 --> 00:02:14.055
you can type these things

00:02:14.055 --> 00:02:14.964
into Google and it will

00:02:14.964 --> 00:02:16.645
just graph it for you.

00:02:16.645 --> 00:02:17.801
And so this right over here

00:02:17.801 --> 00:02:19.058
is just the first two terms.

00:02:19.058 --> 00:02:22.090
This is 3/2 plus six over pi

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:22.923
sine of t.

00:02:23.973 --> 00:02:24.806
And notice it's starting

00:02:24.806 --> 00:02:26.356
to look right because our

00:02:26.356 --> 00:02:27.635
square wave looks something

00:02:27.635 --> 00:02:28.802
like, it goes,

00:02:30.612 --> 00:02:33.595
it looks something like this.

00:02:33.595 --> 00:02:35.492
So it's gonna go like that

00:02:35.492 --> 00:02:38.106
and then it's gonna go down

00:02:38.106 --> 00:02:40.606
to zero and then it's gonna go

00:02:42.831 --> 00:02:44.559
up, looks something like that.

00:02:44.559 --> 00:02:45.392
It doesn't have the pis

00:02:45.392 --> 00:02:46.455
and the two pis

00:02:46.455 --> 00:02:47.302
marked off between these

00:02:47.302 --> 00:02:48.135
because it's gonna look

00:02:48.135 --> 00:02:49.731
something like that.

00:02:49.731 --> 00:02:51.128
So even just the two terms,

00:02:51.128 --> 00:02:52.539
it's kind of a decent approximation

00:02:52.539 --> 00:02:53.912
for even two terms,

00:02:53.912 --> 00:02:54.745
but then as soon as you get

00:02:54.745 --> 00:02:55.578
to three terms,

00:02:55.578 --> 00:02:57.861
if you add the six

00:02:57.861 --> 00:02:59.364
over three pi sine of three t

00:02:59.364 --> 00:03:01.085
to the first two terms.

00:03:01.085 --> 00:03:01.918
So if you look at these

00:03:01.918 --> 00:03:03.566
first three terms,

00:03:03.566 --> 00:03:04.399
now it's looking a lot

00:03:04.399 --> 00:03:05.664
more like a square wave.

00:03:05.664 --> 00:03:08.458
And then if you add the next term,

00:03:08.458 --> 00:03:09.291
well, it looks like even more

00:03:09.291 --> 00:03:10.519
like a square wave,

00:03:10.519 --> 00:03:12.058
and then if you add to that

00:03:12.058 --> 00:03:14.220
what we already wrote down here,

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:15.646
if you were to add to that

00:03:15.646 --> 00:03:16.988
six over seven pi times

00:03:16.988 --> 00:03:18.156
sine of seven t,

00:03:18.156 --> 00:03:19.044
it looks even more

00:03:19.044 --> 00:03:20.382
like a square wave.

00:03:20.382 --> 00:03:21.675
So this is pretty neat.

00:03:21.675 --> 00:03:22.945
You can visually see

00:03:22.945 --> 00:03:24.405
that we were actually able

00:03:24.405 --> 00:03:25.238
to do it.

00:03:25.238 --> 00:03:26.454
And it all kind of just

00:03:26.454 --> 00:03:28.860
fell out from the mathematics.
