00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:02.470
The Nobel Prizes are handed
out to humanity's best

00:00:02.470 --> 00:00:04.840
and brightest, but sometimes
even the best and brightest

00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:05.465
get overlooked.

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:11.990
Howdy folks.

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:14.290
Trace here wrapping up
the coverage for DNews.

00:00:14.290 --> 00:00:16.890
The Nobel Prizes were
announced over the last week,

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:19.590
and there were a couple
of surprises out there.

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:21.520
The prizes come in six
categories, chemistry,

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:24.340
economics, literature,
medicine, peace and physics.

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:26.990
This year, three scientists
shared the chemistry prize

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:28.890
for creating computer
models of molecules

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:31.330
so we don't have to use these
peg and ball ones anymore.

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:34.800
Canadian author, Alice Munro,
took the literature award home,

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.390
three Americans won the
Nobel Prize in medicine

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:39.750
for discovering how cells
transport things around.

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:41.180
They're like little factories.

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:43.830
The Organization for the
Prohibition of Chemical Weapons

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:46.040
was awarded the
Nobel Peace Prize,

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:48.570
and the prize for physics
went to two scientists who

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:50.700
discovered the Higgs
boson particle.

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.860
Economics doesn't get
handed out until Monday.

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:54.852
Kind of an incredible
list, don't you think?

00:00:54.852 --> 00:00:56.310
But what about the
amazing projects

00:00:56.310 --> 00:00:59.320
that didn't warrant a Nobel win?

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:02.090
The Nobel Prize for peace
is pretty existential.

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:04.760
How do people encourage
peace globally?

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:06.510
Removing chemical
weapons is a great one,

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:08.274
but what about
promoting non-violence

00:01:08.274 --> 00:01:10.190
in the face of a much
more powerful aggressor?

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:13.180
Mahatma Gandhi promoted a
free and independent India

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:15.870
and was assassinated in 1948.

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:18.300
Though his efforts helped
the Britons to quit India,

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:20.430
he never won a Nobel
Prize for peace.

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.960
Though he was
nominated posthumously.

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:26.070
I think we all agree the idea
that DNA and genes passed

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:28.990
from parents to offspring is
pretty much a game changer,

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:31.630
but the scientists credited
for the discovery never

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:34.060
won the Nobel Prize for
physiology and medicine.

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:36.360
In the 1940s, Oswald
Avery discovered

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:39.150
it wasn't a protein which
passed your hereditary traits

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:41.340
to your children,
but DNA itself.

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.169
Which might seem kind
of like, oh, duh now.

00:01:43.169 --> 00:01:45.460
But then, it was revolutionary,
because most scientists

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:46.670
thought the opposite.

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:48.080
The Human Genome
Project might be

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:50.250
one of the most interesting
and wonderful things

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:53.450
to happen with the human
DNA since it was discovered.

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:55.655
And since that project
was completed in 2003,

00:01:55.655 --> 00:01:57.280
we've been learning
things about humans

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:59.170
we may never have
discovered without it.

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:02.480
We've catalogued all the DNA
of the whole human, and still

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:03.460
no Nobel Prize.

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:05.550
There are so many more
of these, you guys.

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:07.630
The Nobel Prize for
chemistry was never

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:09.680
given to Dmitri
Mendeleev for creating

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:11.790
the modern periodic table.

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:13.570
The inventor of radio
telecommunications,

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:16.170
Nikola Tesla, never received
a prize for physics.

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:18.350
Robert Noyce, the
inventor of the microchip,

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:19.340
never got a prize.

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:21.570
Fred Hoyle, who coined
the term the Big Bang,

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:25.090
claimed new elements were made
inside stars during fusion,

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:26.680
never got a Nobel
Prize for that.

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:29.420
Leo Tolstoy, one of the most
critically acclaimed novelist

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:32.430
in human history, no Nobel medal
we're hanging around his neck.

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:33.900
We could talk
about this all day.

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:36.280
There are only so
many Nobel prizes.

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:38.690
And unfortunately for
some, once in awhile

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:41.270
you've got this great season
and it's hard to pick.

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:43.610
And other times
it's pretty sparse.

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:45.990
I mean, personally, I'd love
to see Malala Yousafzai win

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:47.440
for her work toward peace.

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:49.370
The Taliban shot her
in the head for simply

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:50.480
trying to go to school.

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:51.960
Education, it's important.

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:54.520
She stood up to them
peacefully, survived,

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:56.070
and is still working
for peace today.

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:58.510
I think the Nobel Prizes
are an incredible way

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:02.050
to show recognition for
humanity's best achievements.

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:03.270
But how do you feel about it?
