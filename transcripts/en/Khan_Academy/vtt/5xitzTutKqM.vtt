00:00:00.251 --> 00:00:02.158
- [Instructor] What we're
going to do in this video

00:00:02.158 --> 00:00:04.883
is prove that the limit

00:00:04.883 --> 00:00:07.358
as theta approaches zero

00:00:07.358 --> 00:00:08.691
of sine of theta

00:00:10.196 --> 00:00:13.082
over theta is equal to one.

00:00:13.082 --> 00:00:15.599
So let's start with a
little bit of a geometric

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:19.149
or trigonometric construction
that I have here.

00:00:19.149 --> 00:00:22.675
So this white circle,
this is a unit circle,

00:00:22.675 --> 00:00:24.251
that we'll label it as such.

00:00:24.251 --> 00:00:26.091
So it has radius one,

00:00:26.091 --> 00:00:27.607
unit

00:00:27.607 --> 00:00:28.440
circle.

00:00:29.432 --> 00:00:31.183
So what does the length

00:00:31.183 --> 00:00:34.907
of this salmon-colored line represent?

00:00:34.907 --> 00:00:38.482
Well, the height of this line
would be the y-coordinate

00:00:38.482 --> 00:00:42.407
of where this radius
intersects the unit circle.

00:00:42.407 --> 00:00:45.242
And so by definition, by
the unit circle definition

00:00:45.242 --> 00:00:48.425
of trig functions, the length of this line

00:00:48.425 --> 00:00:50.842
is going to be sine of theta.

00:00:52.307 --> 00:00:55.075
If we wanted to make sure
that also worked for thetas

00:00:55.075 --> 00:00:58.000
that end up in the fourth
quadrant, which will be useful,

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.983
we can just insure that
it's the absolute value

00:01:00.983 --> 00:01:02.825
of the sine of theta.

00:01:02.825 --> 00:01:05.292
Now what about this blue line over here?

00:01:05.292 --> 00:01:08.992
Can I express that in terms
of a trigonometric function?

00:01:08.992 --> 00:01:09.825
Well, let's think about it.

00:01:09.825 --> 00:01:12.050
What would tangent of theta be?

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:13.474
Let me write it over here.

00:01:13.474 --> 00:01:15.632
Tangent of theta

00:01:15.632 --> 00:01:18.549
is equal to opposite over adjacent.

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:24.242
So if we look at this broader
triangle right over here,

00:01:24.242 --> 00:01:27.165
this is our angle theta in radians.

00:01:27.165 --> 00:01:29.484
This is the opposite side.

00:01:29.484 --> 00:01:32.559
The adjacent side down here,
this just has length one.

00:01:32.559 --> 00:01:34.624
Remember, this is a unit circle.

00:01:34.624 --> 00:01:36.424
So this just has length one,

00:01:36.424 --> 00:01:39.716
so the tangent of theta
is the opposite side.

00:01:39.716 --> 00:01:43.971
The opposite side is equal
to the tangent of theta.

00:01:43.971 --> 00:01:46.484
And just like before, this is
going to be a positive value

00:01:46.484 --> 00:01:48.475
for sitting here in the first quadrant

00:01:48.475 --> 00:01:49.690
but I want things to work

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:51.958
in both the first and the fourth quadrant

00:01:51.958 --> 00:01:53.357
for the sake of our proof,

00:01:53.357 --> 00:01:56.133
so I'm just gonna put
an absolute value here.

00:01:56.133 --> 00:01:57.432
So now that we've done,

00:01:57.432 --> 00:01:59.324
I'm gonna think about some triangles

00:01:59.324 --> 00:02:01.307
and their respective areas.

00:02:01.307 --> 00:02:03.400
So first, I'm gonna draw a triangle

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:07.225
that sits in this wedge,
in this pie piece,

00:02:07.225 --> 00:02:10.324
this pie slice within the circle,

00:02:10.324 --> 00:02:13.074
so I can construct this triangle.

00:02:14.382 --> 00:02:16.234
And so let's think about the area

00:02:16.234 --> 00:02:20.217
of what I am shading in right over here.

00:02:20.217 --> 00:02:22.550
How can I express that area?

00:02:23.582 --> 00:02:24.774
Well, it's a triangle.

00:02:24.774 --> 00:02:26.349
We know that the area of a triangle

00:02:26.349 --> 00:02:29.750
is 1/2 base times height.

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:30.741
We know the height

00:02:30.741 --> 00:02:32.792
is the absolute value of the sine of theta

00:02:32.792 --> 00:02:35.758
and we know that the base is equal to one,

00:02:35.758 --> 00:02:39.925
so the area here is
going to be equal to 1/2

00:02:41.258 --> 00:02:43.824
times our base, which is one,

00:02:43.824 --> 00:02:44.842
times our height,

00:02:44.842 --> 00:02:48.192
which is the absolute
value of the sine of theta.

00:02:48.192 --> 00:02:49.433
I'll rewrite it over here.

00:02:49.433 --> 00:02:50.341
I can just rewrite that

00:02:50.341 --> 00:02:54.791
as the absolute value of
the sine of theta over two.

00:02:54.791 --> 00:02:58.458
Now let's think about
the area of this wedge

00:02:58.458 --> 00:03:02.608
that I am highlighting
in this yellow color.

00:03:02.608 --> 00:03:07.075
So what fraction of the entire
circle is this going to be?

00:03:07.075 --> 00:03:08.833
If I were to go all the
way around the circle,

00:03:08.833 --> 00:03:10.335
it would be two pi radians,

00:03:10.335 --> 00:03:14.502
so this is theta over to
two pis of the entire circle

00:03:15.607 --> 00:03:17.167
and we know the area of the circle.

00:03:17.167 --> 00:03:19.724
This is a unit circle,
it has a radius one,

00:03:19.724 --> 00:03:21.399
so it'd be times the area of the circle,

00:03:21.399 --> 00:03:24.017
which would be pi times the radius square,

00:03:24.017 --> 00:03:26.666
the radius is one, so it's
just gonna be times pi.

00:03:26.666 --> 00:03:29.342
And so the area of this
wedge right over here,

00:03:29.342 --> 00:03:30.592
theta over two.

00:03:31.466 --> 00:03:33.200
And if we wanted to make this work

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:35.689
for thetas in the fourth quadrant,

00:03:35.689 --> 00:03:38.900
we could just write an absolute
value sign right over there

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:42.082
'cause we're talking about positive area.

00:03:42.082 --> 00:03:44.999
And now let's think about
this larger triangle

00:03:44.999 --> 00:03:48.807
in this blue color, and this
is pretty straightforward.

00:03:48.807 --> 00:03:53.149
The area here is gonna be
1/2 times base times height.

00:03:53.149 --> 00:03:57.333
So the area, and once again,
this is this entire are,

00:03:57.333 --> 00:04:01.413
that's going to be 1/2 times
our base, which is one,

00:04:01.413 --> 00:04:02.246
times our height,

00:04:02.246 --> 00:04:05.808
which is the absolute
value of tangent of theta.

00:04:05.808 --> 00:04:07.158
And so I can just write that down

00:04:07.158 --> 00:04:11.325
as the absolute value of the
tangent of theta over two.

00:04:12.439 --> 00:04:14.550
Now, how would you compare the areas

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:18.532
of this pink or this
salmon-colored triangle

00:04:18.532 --> 00:04:20.614
which sits inside of this wedge

00:04:20.614 --> 00:04:21.991
and how do you compare
that area of the wedge

00:04:21.991 --> 00:04:23.641
to the bigger triangle?

00:04:23.641 --> 00:04:25.899
Well, it's clear that the
area of the salmon triangle

00:04:25.899 --> 00:04:28.341
is less than or equal
to the area of the wedge

00:04:28.341 --> 00:04:30.782
and the area of the wedge
is less than or equal to

00:04:30.782 --> 00:04:33.415
the area of the big, blue triangle.

00:04:33.415 --> 00:04:35.492
The wedge includes the salmon triangle

00:04:35.492 --> 00:04:37.633
plus this area right over here,

00:04:37.633 --> 00:04:40.766
and then the blue triangle
includes the wedge

00:04:40.766 --> 00:04:43.993
plus it has this area right over here.

00:04:43.993 --> 00:04:45.592
So I think we can feel good visually

00:04:45.592 --> 00:04:48.058
that this statement
right over here is true

00:04:48.058 --> 00:04:48.891
and I'm just gonna do

00:04:48.891 --> 00:04:50.900
a little bit of algebraic manipulation.

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:53.450
Let me multiply everything by two

00:04:53.450 --> 00:04:56.790
so I can rewrite that the absolute value

00:04:56.790 --> 00:05:00.514
of sine of theta is less than or equal to

00:05:00.514 --> 00:05:03.124
the absolute value of theta

00:05:03.124 --> 00:05:07.341
which is less than or
equal to the absolute value

00:05:07.341 --> 00:05:10.149
of tangent of theta, and let's see.

00:05:10.149 --> 00:05:11.699
Actually, instead of
writing the absolute value

00:05:11.699 --> 00:05:13.766
of tangent of theta,
I'm gonna rewrite that

00:05:13.766 --> 00:05:16.933
as the absolute value of sine of theta

00:05:18.359 --> 00:05:22.399
over the absolute value
of cosine of theta.

00:05:22.399 --> 00:05:23.524
That's gonna be the same thing

00:05:23.524 --> 00:05:27.007
as the absolute value of tangent of theta.

00:05:27.007 --> 00:05:27.957
And the reason why I did that

00:05:27.957 --> 00:05:29.775
is we can now divide everything

00:05:29.775 --> 00:05:32.200
by the absolute value of sine of theta.

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:34.391
Since we're dividing
by a positive quantity,

00:05:34.391 --> 00:05:37.384
it's not going to change the
direction of the inequalities.

00:05:37.384 --> 00:05:38.983
So let's do that

00:05:38.983 --> 00:05:40.767
I'm gonna divide this

00:05:40.767 --> 00:05:44.270
by an absolute value of sine of theta.

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:45.550
I'm gonna divide this

00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:49.091
by an absolute value of the sine of theta

00:05:49.091 --> 00:05:50.499
and then I'm gonna divide this

00:05:50.499 --> 00:05:54.083
by an absolute value of the sine of theta.

00:05:54.083 --> 00:05:55.654
And what do I get?

00:05:55.654 --> 00:05:57.987
Well, over here, I get a one

00:05:59.168 --> 00:06:00.807
and on the right-hand side, I get a one

00:06:00.807 --> 00:06:03.456
over the absolute value of cosine theta.

00:06:03.456 --> 00:06:05.206
These two cancel out.

00:06:06.466 --> 00:06:08.216
So the next step I'm gonna do

00:06:08.216 --> 00:06:11.142
is take the reciprocal of everything.

00:06:11.142 --> 00:06:13.141
And so when I take the
reciprocal of everything,

00:06:13.141 --> 00:06:15.932
that actually will
switch the inequalities.

00:06:15.932 --> 00:06:19.034
The reciprocal of one
is still going to be one

00:06:19.034 --> 00:06:20.983
but now, since I'm taking
the reciprocal of this here,

00:06:20.983 --> 00:06:24.340
it's gonna be greater than or equal to

00:06:24.340 --> 00:06:27.590
the absolute value of the sine of theta

00:06:28.474 --> 00:06:31.025
over the absolute value of theta,

00:06:31.025 --> 00:06:35.500
and that's going to be
greater than or equal to

00:06:35.500 --> 00:06:36.474
the reciprocal of one

00:06:36.474 --> 00:06:39.293
over the absolute value of cosine of theta

00:06:39.293 --> 00:06:42.710
is the absolute value of cosine of theta.

00:06:43.650 --> 00:06:46.574
We really just care about the
first and fourth quadrants.

00:06:46.574 --> 00:06:48.383
You can think about this theta

00:06:48.383 --> 00:06:50.332
approaching zero from that direction

00:06:50.332 --> 00:06:52.557
or from that direction there,

00:06:52.557 --> 00:06:55.242
so that would be the first
and fourth quadrants.

00:06:55.242 --> 00:06:58.733
So if we're in the first
quadrant and theta is positive,

00:06:58.733 --> 00:07:01.108
sine of theta is gonna
be positive as well.

00:07:01.108 --> 00:07:03.529
And if we're in the fourth
quadrant and theta's negative,

00:07:03.529 --> 00:07:05.084
well, sine of theta is
gonna have the same sign.

00:07:05.084 --> 00:07:07.125
It's going to be negative as well.

00:07:07.125 --> 00:07:09.358
And so these absolute value
signs aren't necessary.

00:07:09.358 --> 00:07:10.241
In the first quadrant,

00:07:10.241 --> 00:07:12.633
sine of theta and theta are both positive.

00:07:12.633 --> 00:07:14.592
In the fourth quadrant,
they're both negative,

00:07:14.592 --> 00:07:15.633
but when you divide them,

00:07:15.633 --> 00:07:20.299
you're going to get a positive
value, so I can erase those.

00:07:20.299 --> 00:07:22.108
If we're in the first or fourth quadrant,

00:07:22.108 --> 00:07:24.259
our X value is not negative,

00:07:24.259 --> 00:07:26.900
and so cosine of theta,
which is the x-coordinate

00:07:26.900 --> 00:07:29.858
on our unit circle, is
not going to be negative,

00:07:29.858 --> 00:07:33.250
and so we don't need the
absolute value signs over there.

00:07:33.250 --> 00:07:34.917
Now, we should pause a second

00:07:34.917 --> 00:07:37.642
because we're actually almost done.

00:07:37.642 --> 00:07:39.383
We have just set up three functions.

00:07:39.383 --> 00:07:42.492
You could think of this
as f of x is equal to,

00:07:42.492 --> 00:07:44.542
you could view this as f
of theta is equal to one,

00:07:44.542 --> 00:07:45.938
g of theta is equal to this,

00:07:45.938 --> 00:07:47.908
and h of theta is equal to that.

00:07:47.908 --> 00:07:49.882
And over the interval that we care about,

00:07:49.882 --> 00:07:52.965
we could say for negative pi over two

00:07:53.891 --> 00:07:57.132
is less than theta is
less than pi over two,

00:07:57.132 --> 00:07:59.599
but over this interval,
this is true for any theta

00:07:59.599 --> 00:08:01.925
over which these functions are defined.

00:08:01.925 --> 00:08:04.600
Sine of theta over theta is
defined over this interval,

00:08:04.600 --> 00:08:06.917
except where theta is equal to zero.

00:08:06.917 --> 00:08:08.599
But since we're defined everywhere else,

00:08:08.599 --> 00:08:11.316
we can now find the limit.

00:08:11.316 --> 00:08:14.716
So what we can say is,
well, by the squeeze theorem

00:08:14.716 --> 00:08:16.358
or by the sandwich theorem,

00:08:16.358 --> 00:08:18.283
if this is true over the interval,

00:08:18.283 --> 00:08:20.574
then we also know that
the following is true.

00:08:20.574 --> 00:08:23.300
And this, we deserve a
little bit of a drum roll.

00:08:23.300 --> 00:08:24.908
The limit

00:08:24.908 --> 00:08:27.575
as theta approaches zero of this

00:08:28.883 --> 00:08:33.474
is going to be greater
than or equal to the limit

00:08:33.474 --> 00:08:36.532
as theta approaches zero of this,

00:08:36.532 --> 00:08:37.891
which is the one that we care about,

00:08:37.891 --> 00:08:40.440
sine of theta over theta,

00:08:40.440 --> 00:08:45.375
which is going to be greater
than or equal to the limit

00:08:45.375 --> 00:08:48.125
as theta approaches zero of this.

00:08:49.717 --> 00:08:53.600
Now this is clearly going
to be just equal to one.

00:08:53.600 --> 00:08:55.842
This is what we care about.

00:08:55.842 --> 00:08:58.050
And this, what's the limit
as theta approaches zero

00:08:58.050 --> 00:08:59.457
of cosine of theta?

00:08:59.457 --> 00:09:01.158
Well, cosine of zero is just one

00:09:01.158 --> 00:09:02.799
and it's a continuous function,

00:09:02.799 --> 00:09:04.599
so this is just gonna be one.

00:09:04.599 --> 00:09:05.432
So let's see.

00:09:05.432 --> 00:09:07.392
This limit is going to be
less than or equal to one

00:09:07.392 --> 00:09:09.347
and it's gonna be greater
than or equal to one,

00:09:09.347 --> 00:09:11.680
so this must be equal to one

00:09:13.832 --> 00:09:14.929
and we are done.
