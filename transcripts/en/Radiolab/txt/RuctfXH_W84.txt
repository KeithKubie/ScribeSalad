Speaker 1:          00:00          Hey, I'm Jad Abumrad. I'm Robert Krulwich. This is radio lab, and today we're talking about the interior space that runs down from your much to your butt, and it is called your gut. You might, what is that? It's just an an old person's word for mouth. Anyhow, as we just heard for a very, very long time, people believed that the stomach was a place of magical transformation. Yeah. But of course, as we know now, it's just a big muscle with acid and enzymes and stuff, but if you travel a little deeper down, down below the stomach, yeah. Then things get spooky again. We just, you know, we, we have these sort of shadowy images of what's going on in there. That's Carl Zimmer, a shadowy figure himself, a science writer. And can I, can I get some water? Yeah. And the frequently thirsty Matt, third guy, little scratchy Soren.

Speaker 1:          00:54          And I called him up, you know, while you were gone on paternity leave. Yup. And he told us you want to mystery. Yeah, I do that. Okay. Then the stomach is just a warmup. Oh yeah. The 25 feet of coiled, soiled, fitted tubing inside you. Give me the intestines. Yeah. Yeah. That's where the real mystery lies, you know, because here's the riddle is the part of you that turns the world outside into you, isn't just you. It's more like a collective. What does he mean by that? Well, if you zoom into our intestine [inaudible], what you'll see is legions of tiny creatures, bacteria, viruses, fungi, protozoans, and those are all little single cell kind of guys. We're talking about non human things inside of me. How many of you, how many of you guys would you say me? Yeah, probably in the order of maybe a couple thousand species.

Speaker 1:          01:50          So there's Nikolai Interior Odis for jellies and then another one, another one. It's a whole universe down there. Yeah. Microbacteria travel bacteria. Your senior that follow Caucus Chromo back the bureau. Some of them you'll find in all of us and then there are just a whole bunch of other species that are rarer. Might mean one person and not in the other. It's like a rain forest. No. Yeah. There are ecologists now studying your gut, looking at these complicated networks of hundreds of thousands of species that are living inside of you and depending on each other or praying on each other. It's just this incredibly [inaudible] complicated pattern that scientists haven't figured out. When you're in an embryonics in a, what is it called? The Sachs, your amniotic sac, your amniotic sac. How much bacteria do you have in about your there? You're sterile. You have none. No, at all. You're clean, Huh? But then as you are, all of a sudden you're into this new environment. The birth canal, you're breathing, your mouth is open, stuff is into your mouth. It's coating your skin. There are lots of bacteria. There is vagina in the birth canal. It's a very complicated ecosystem there. And

Speaker 1:          03:09          right after you were born, Chez crawl, you meet a nurse and some doctors who go home to play in your backyard, you'll suck on the shoe. They might eat some dirt and get licked by a dog. And by the time you're going to school, you've got probably about a hundred Chilean micro organisms that, so 100 trillion other kinds of cells in you. Yeah. So if you were to take like all the bacteria in your body and just made them into one lump, it would be about three pounds. Oh really? Think of it as an organ. I mean, your brain is about three pounds. Your heart, you know, hearts a pound or two. So this is another organ. In this case, it's an organ that helps you digest food. But here's the thing, this place in you which is filled with foreign critters, somehow this organ gets into your head.

Speaker 2:          04:01          What does that even mean? Wait, you just wait a second. Let me introduce you to someone. Ah, hello. Can you hear me? Yes. Yep, we can hear you, John. My name is professor John Crying. I'm a the professor and chair of Anatomy and neuroscience here at University College Cork in Ireland. And I'm a neuroscientist. A brain guy. Yup. If someone told me six years ago I was in neuroscientist that I'd be here talking about microbes. I would have laughed it off. But to make a long story short, John found that he was getting into neuroscience. A lot of the neuroscientists at his university in Cork in Ireland. They were getting into bugs for reasons that will become apparent in a moment. And eventually he got the bug for books and began to work with this one particular strain of bacteria. The lactobacillus strain. What was it? Lactose something.

Speaker 2:          04:44          Lactobacillus. Lactobacillus rhamnosus. It's looks like a pill really is kind of oblong thing and it's sometimes used to make yogurt. We were interested in whether I, uh, if you fed mice with this for a number of weeks, whether the, it would alter their behavioral state, meaning if you fed these mice, a bunch of this bacteria, would they become very different mice? Yeah, different mice. You mean like different my fat or mice or something? No, no, no, no, no. Would they change their personalities? This is like a profound change because of a, a bacteria in their stomach. Yeah. Not In their brain. No. Just in their tummies. Just in their tummy. That's insane. That's not going to work. But let me tell you what he did. All right. He had two groups of mice. One of them got the Lactobacillus, the others, they got just normal mouse food. We fed them a broth just as a control, so it didn't have any bacteria.

Speaker 2:          05:35          Then we looked at how they responded to a mild water stress. And what we found was that I [inaudible] sorry. Well it's water. It's water at room temperature. It's, it's basically what he did is he took these two groups of mice, the bacteria, mice and the no bacteria mice. And then he would drop them into a of water. And all roads are very good swimmers, but they just don't like water. Oh. And what he was looking for was any difference between the two groups in terms of how they dealt with this water situation. Like if one group squeaks more than the other or something. No, you just keep an open mind and you wait and see what's going to happen. Fine. So air you go. Starting with the first group, the normal ones, he drops them in and as you'd expect, they try and escape. They try and escape anytime them to see how long they keep at it. Okay. And one minute passes. They swim, they swim to the edge and all around looking for an escape. Two minutes past three minutes path, but about four minutes in, he says the mice start to get worn down and then they decide. At this point there's no point I'm giving up.

Speaker 3:          06:49          [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          06:49          which means what? They, the, the ordinary might just go and do a dead mouse float. Yeah. A dead mouse flows. You know, they just gave up. They don't drown. No, no, no. They sit there, sit there and think, oh, I will waiting this out until it's over. Exactly. It's been coined behavioral despair. That is how a normal mouse reacts to being tossed into water. It struggles for about four minutes. It gives up and then sinks into despair for the second group. And this is the group that ate the bacteria. Yeah. Dudes also drop them in the water. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Here we go. At first he says they were just like the first group. They were swimming around frantically for one minute, two minutes, three minutes, but then at the four minute mark when the first group of mice had given up these mice, they kept going.

Speaker 2:          07:42          They kept looking for an hour past four minutes to five minutes, six minutes. So they're not despairing. Exactly. And they might've kept going on and on and on, but he then plucked them out of the water after six minutes. The thing is kind of strange. It's like, you know, worrying and scurrying about and panicking like that all seems like what it is to be a mouse. And you're saying that a bacteria in the gut can change that? Yeah. Wait a second, Soren. Okay, fine. There seems to be a difference between these two groups, but how do you know? How does John know that the bacteria had anything to do with it? Well, you didn't just stare at the mice. He looked at their, at their mouse chemistry by looking at the stress hormones and we measured them. What he found is that in the first group though, the mice that quit and despaired, we got about a hundred fold increase in a corticosterone levels. That's the hormonal version of exactly. And in that first group, when he dropped them in the water, their blood flooded with this one, which initially, you know, it's not a bad thing because a mouse has to act, but all out panic isn't great for a little mouse. And after a couple of minutes of hormone coursing through the veins, the mouse just burns out and down.

Speaker 2:          08:57          But in the second group of mice, now these are the mice that eat the bacteria. We found that in the mice fed the lactobacillus, they, well, first of all, they had half as much of that stress hormone half and they had another chemical. Suddenly in the mix, we found very, very distinct changes in the receptors for Gaba in a variety of brain regions. Gabba Gabba Gabba well, he says, you can think of it as the opposite of a stress hormone. It basically is there to shut down the brain, stop things inhibit, uh, make us more relaxed, chilled out. And he thinks what's happening is that in these mice that ate the bacteria, they hit the water. The stress hormones come online. But before things get too intense incomes, Gabba Gabba just goes,

Speaker 4:          09:44          hey [inaudible].

Speaker 2:          09:57          And as a result, these mice, they're chilled out, they're relaxed, they're not afraid. They never panic. They never burn out. And they never fall into despair. They behaved as if they were on Ballium.

Speaker 2:          10:13          So somehow the mice, the gut bacteria of the bias are sending volume to the brain. Is that what he's saying? That's what he's saying. Yeah. But you haven't, he hasn't said anything about bacteria yet. It's a long distance. Well, let me get your brain up here. John told me that if you look inside a mouse's body, you will find a giant nerve. The vagus nerve that runs between the Gus and the brain. Oh, you mean like a phone line? Exactly. And he thought, well, maybe they chemically tickle one end of the line, send a signal up to the brain, which then makes the Gaba. Now in order to prove this, he thought his mind, I just cut the line basically sever the Vegas nerve. Oh, because then if the bacteria are the ones doing it, if he cuts the phone line they won't be able to do it anymore and then the mind should go back to normal.

Speaker 2:          11:00          Exactly. So in collaboration with my colleagues at McMaster in Ontario, he got some mice, we fed them the bacteria again, but this time before throwing them into the pool, he cut the nerve and we found that all of the changes that we had seen, the swimming forever, that not giving up and the neuro chemical changes in the brain, the Gaba, she making them so calm. We're completely absent. Ah, you cut out the highway and then the did the communication, the grainy changes stop. Totally. Totally. Huh. When nick got the nerve, the mice went back to being quitters. Yep. You have to be convinced that. Okay, I'm convinced. So here's my question though. This is a mouse we're talking about. This is just a mouse. Does this have anything to say about us? I mean, is there any connection to make?

Speaker 1:          11:54          Well, I asked Carl that question there. There was one study, uh, that, where was it? Uh, Oh, you know what? Oh, so this was a clinical trial actually done in France last year. That's Jonah Lira, who regularly reports about things in neurological for us and, and others. And he knew about the study too. Yes. So they fed people just massive doses of probiotics and probiotic mean like the good ones versus the bad ones. Yeah. Probiotics or the good gut bacteria. They're in yogurt and things like that. So these guys from France, they gave these people packets, like sugar sized packets of powder inside the package. There are two different kinds of bugs and October facilities, Helvetica, bifidobacterium, Longum, two of my favorite. Yeah. Well you should like them because I gave them to people and they showed a fairly dramatic reduction in their baseline anxiety levels that became less stressful and had less anxiety because when they took them to high diving boards and threw them off and fill the screen.

Speaker 1:          12:52          And how did they, how do you test these things? Um, I say the Hopkins Symptom checklist, basically they did a little survey and asked questions. Uh, how distressed do you feel? You know, they took levels of stress hormones on a 24 hour urinary free cortisol, you know, so they had some quantitative measures and people who took those probiotics had, they felt less angry, less anxious, and less depressed. So the gut bugs have us on a chain to, yeah, cause we, you know, we have, you know, one thing to remember is like, you know, our mood, a lot of the way our mood is set is through Serotonin. That's like when they do antidepressant drugs, it's the serotonin uptake something. So you're controlling them out. Serotonin, that's going in and out of your neurons, right? You have very little serotonin in your brain, but it makes a huge difference.

Speaker 1:          13:38          You have a huge supply of Serotonin in your gut. 80% of all the Serotonin in your body is in your gut. Really? Yeah. And that bacteria can be feeding on that stuff. And you know there could be, it could be that you know they, you have an oil well of happiness in your gut and if you get the right pump, you could feel happy more of the Times. One possibility. So Jared, when you and I are sitting around feeling all stressed and anxious, or if we're just happy and, and gay in the old sense of word, now we know that this mood is shadowed, influenced, and shaped by the bacteria you have in your intestine.

Speaker 1:          14:14          The kinds of studies that show this effect, they've all happened in the past couple of years and that's it, period. But there's this judge review. It was in the proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. It was just kind of commenting on a couple of these studies and saying like, hmm, let's think about which bacteria we should focus on for psychological treatments. Let's think about how we can treat people's psychological disorders with bacteria this way. Let's just think about it. This isn't the proceedings of the National Academy of the sciences. They're talking about treating psychological disorders with yogurt. Yeah, medicinal yogurt in the future. Medicinal as in Prozac. Sure. Medicinal as in whatever they'd give to people with schizophrenia. Well I don't, I mean who knows. I mean who knows what will work and what won't work. It's just, but it's something that people are saying like we need to look into this. There's something for me, a little poetic about the fact that a lot of our moods come from the same organ that produces, I mean, I haven't put my finger on what's poetic about that, but, but it just does kind of, I mean it, it does make a little bit more sense when you step back and think about this from the spectrum of evolution that you know, our biggest decisions way back when, where, what to eat, is this gonna kill me and make me sick?

Speaker 1:          15:33          Is this food spoiled? So it makes sense that the part of the body which can detect that is also intimately connected with decision making. Systems that have to do with this gonna make me happy or this is, I should fear this and not eat this. So as I landish as it seems that you know, the self is connected with the part of the body that it, it also has a little bit of engineering logic to it.

Speaker 2:          15:55          Uh Huh

Speaker 4:          16:14          [inaudible] [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          16:15          special thanks to Carl Zimmer. His latest book is called science ink. It's a description of tattoos that people get on scientific themes and you can see them on their arms, their legs, thighs, and embarrassing places. Yes, thanks. Also to Jonah Lehrer, whose new book is called, imagine how creativity works and you can see their creativity on their nose, eyes, cheeks, and embarrassing places. Speaking of embarrassing places, we're going to go to one right now. We'll be right back.

Speaker 4:          16:41          Okay.

Speaker 2:          16:42          Special thanks to Carl Zimmer. His latest book is called science ink. It's a description of tattoos that people get, uh, on the scientific themes and you can see them on their arms, their legs, thighs, and embarrassing places. Yes. And thanks.
