2009. Her books are published throughout the

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:16.660
world in countries such as England and Thailand,
the Netherlands and China, Russia and Israel.

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:17.780
So, without further ado, Ayelet.

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:35.460
Ayelet: You gotta tell me what's up with the
guy eating his lunch over there. That's just,

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:43.030
we're just all gonna pretend we're not noticing?

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:44.920
[inaudible response].

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:54.120
Ayelet: Ah, I get it, Hi. Hi there actually.
So thank you so much [inaudible] for inviting

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:55.120
me. I've always wanted to eat in your cafeteria
ever since I saw that Google chef wipe out

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:56.120
so dramatically on Top Chef. Did you guys
see that? She seemed really nice, her food

00:01:56.120 --> 00:02:02.670
seemed a little iffy, but I have, I was inspired.
And um, I actually when um, when I tweeted

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:11.700
that I was coming down to the, you know, to
talk here today, I don't know how many people

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:19.159
immediately said are you going to go eat in
the cafeteria? And there are, this is probably

00:02:19.159 --> 00:02:26.060
not news to you, but there are a number of
employees of Google who take a photograph

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:28.299
of their lunch every day and upload it to
a flicker stream. [Laughter]

00:02:28.299 --> 00:02:34.019
Yeah, yeah, it was a good lunch. I don't quite
know what that says about how much time y'all

00:02:34.019 --> 00:02:39.840
have on your hands. But um, alright, so I'm
going to uh talk a little bit about my last

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:45.510
book, which is called Bad Mother. Um, and
in particular, one area that I never get to

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:48.340
talk about this cause I never know whether
any body in my audience will really get what

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:52.680
I'm talking about, so it's a pleasure to be
here and I assume you all are going to understand

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:56.980
what I'm, my reference is. So, when I first
got pregnant with my son Zeke, who's my second

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:02.370
kid, who's 13 years old now, the first thing
I did; absolutely first thing I did even before

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:08.939
I verified that I was pregnant was, I joined
an on-line support group for mothers due in

00:03:08.939 --> 00:03:15.439
the month of June, 1997. Okay, so that was
like, totally dark ages, right, way back in

00:03:15.439 --> 00:03:21.019
1997. There were no Yahoo groups, there were
no Google groups, nobody had even heard of

00:03:21.019 --> 00:03:27.010
you guys. Those were the days when we were
using things like Alta Vista and Ask Jeeves

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:34.199
no less. For navigation through the ether
I don't know how, how many of you live in

00:03:34.199 --> 00:03:37.430
the East Bay but there was an Ask Jeeves billboard
up for just forever, long after it became

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:43.790
sort of the poignant reminder of the early
days of the internet. But that's when I joined

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:51.150
this first email group. Um, there wasn't even
a web yet. People were just, people who knew

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:53.879
what the web was were starting to talk about
it, but to everybody else, we just called

00:03:53.879 --> 00:04:01.450
it the internet. Um, and there certainly were
not 500 million blogs with information about,

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:09.019
you know, the genesis of toenail fungus, whether
Matt Smith can really step into David Tennant's

00:04:09.019 --> 00:04:11.659
shoes, anybody? [applause] Thank you.

00:04:11.659 --> 00:04:14.010
[female voice]: He can't.

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:21.850
Ayelet: No, I know, it's a heartbreak. Those
were more innocent times before the proliferation

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:27.710
of Mommy blogs and online parenting magazines.
Andy Lamont was still over at Mothers Who

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:32.630
Think and Salon. Do you remember those long-ago
days when she was blogging about her baby

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:37.940
Sam; and it was before she'd even published
any of those books that made her such a superstar

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:43.200
and um, just to give you an idea how long
ago that was, Sam, the baby, she was writing

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:48.470
articles about because they were not blog
posts then, just had his own kid. Okay, so

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:52.780
that's how long ago we're talking about. Now
I had a group of friends at the time, who

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:59.150
were using email regularly and this was not
common, I mean sure, all of you probably were,

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:04.600
but this was not really common. They didn't
use it as much as I did maybe because they

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:11.490
had yet to quit their time-consuming and intellectually-satisfying
jobs for the more mundane pleasures of killing

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:16.639
time while the baby naps, but there were 13
of us some of us knew each other from Wesleyan

00:05:16.639 --> 00:05:21.161
University some had gone to school at Columbia
Journalism School. It was this little, we

00:05:21.161 --> 00:05:26.240
had, I had my Junebug list and I had this
little internet group of women who [skips]

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:35.110
most of the group of friends, I don't know
if I should tell you the name of that group,

00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:39.700
what we called ourselves. But suffice it to
say that this was a time when Cyber still

00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:48.570
had kind of a cache about it and um, the literary
genre of Chick Lit had not taken over the

00:05:48.570 --> 00:05:52.410
front tables of bookstores, so if you put
that together you can see what horrible name

00:05:52.410 --> 00:05:53.960
we came up for our little group.

00:05:53.960 --> 00:06:01.810
Um, my, on all my buddies and I were very
regular emailers. Sometime, each of them shot

00:06:01.810 --> 00:06:09.650
off as many as, wait for it, 10 to 20 emails
per day. But, if you're a fast reader and

00:06:09.650 --> 00:06:15.650
you suffer from graphomania as I can do, then
13 correspondents just is not enough no matter

00:06:15.650 --> 00:06:20.200
how prolific they are. And, I can email with
those women, but we can talk about things

00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:27.210
like whether, you know I don't know what my
baby had done to turn her shit that exact

00:06:27.210 --> 00:06:34.480
shade of Easter Egg Blue, [Laughter] I know,
right? I don't know, still to this day. It

00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:41.740
happened periodically, and no one has ever
understood the genesis of it. But I wanted,

00:06:41.740 --> 00:06:46.301
what I wanted, was companionship with women
who were going through exactly the same thing

00:06:46.301 --> 00:06:50.400
at exactly the same moment. I wanted the,
I wanted to be around a bunch of mothers whose

00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:56.250
babies were going to be born in the same month.
So I joined towards, like I said before I

00:06:56.250 --> 00:07:01.540
had even gotten confirmation that I was pregnant,
and this was the listserv expectant mothers

00:07:01.540 --> 00:07:06.870
due in June of about 50 women in at the time
that I joined. Over the course of the next,

00:07:06.870 --> 00:07:11.790
of that first trimester it fluctuated in size
increasing as more people discovered they're

00:07:11.790 --> 00:07:15.952
pregnant or discovered the listserv ebbing
at the eight week mark which, you all probably

00:07:15.952 --> 00:07:21.860
know why, some people found out they weren't
pregnant anymore, that first ultrasound.

00:07:21.860 --> 00:07:27.661
There were people from all over the English-speaking
world, most of us were American. They were

00:07:27.661 --> 00:07:33.290
obviously women of all economic classes, single
mothers on welfare, wives of investment bankers,

00:07:33.290 --> 00:07:38.370
waitresses, pediatric nurses, neurosurgeons,
these were some of the few that I remember.

00:07:38.370 --> 00:07:43.740
There was almost no racial diversity but with
a few exceptions, all women were white but

00:07:43.740 --> 00:07:47.650
in other ways it was a pretty diverse group
of people, right? There was, pretty much anybody

00:07:47.650 --> 00:07:55.680
who had a computer who got knocked up in the
September or October [laughter] of 1996. And

00:07:55.680 --> 00:07:59.680
as you, I'm not telling you guys anything
you don't I know many of you were also back

00:07:59.680 --> 00:08:04.760
in those early days member of those listservs
or are now. It was, for me it these were all

00:08:04.760 --> 00:08:10.830
women that I was not likely to come across
during my day-to-day life. At that point,

00:08:10.830 --> 00:08:17.150
my life had kind of constricted to this tiny
universe of playgrounds and Gymboree classes

00:08:17.150 --> 00:08:24.440
in West Los Angeles. [INAUDIBLE] there was
one woman whose husband left her second month

00:08:24.440 --> 00:08:30.080
of her fifth pregnancy leaving her to raise
all five of her kids without any financial

00:08:30.080 --> 00:08:35.719
or emotional assistance. That was pretty amazing.
There was a pediatric oncologist who left

00:08:35.719 --> 00:08:40.709
her practice when she got pregnant with her,
and here's what we call them, Junebugs, got

00:08:40.709 --> 00:08:48.430
pregnant with her Junebug and became the first
and surely the most overqualified lesbian

00:08:48.430 --> 00:08:55.569
Brownie Troop leader in Hercules, California.
There was an internet entrepreneur supporting

00:08:55.569 --> 00:09:00.700
her agoraphobic DH, I assume you all understand
the reference who, by the time her husband

00:09:00.700 --> 00:09:06.819
or her Junebug was born was neither a D nor
an H. And then there was my personal favorite,

00:09:06.819 --> 00:09:12.420
the reason I stayed with the group I'm sure
is the poly-amorous frequent poster who just

00:09:12.420 --> 00:09:19.889
kind of never understood why her partner's
other partner was not as excited about the

00:09:19.889 --> 00:09:26.149
pregnancy as she was. [Laughter] So, needless
to say, I loved communicating with these total

00:09:26.149 --> 00:09:29.949
strangers, even as they occasionally drove
me nuts. Come on in and sit down. Because

00:09:29.949 --> 00:09:34.990
they were whining about hemorrhoids and breast
tenderness, but I was whining about hemorrhoids

00:09:34.990 --> 00:09:38.740
and breast tenderness. And so, it was just
this wonderful way to go online and whine

00:09:38.740 --> 00:09:43.440
about hemorrhoids and breast tenderness with
people who cared about my hemorrhoids and

00:09:43.440 --> 00:09:50.910
my breast tenderness. Everybody else in my
life kind of rebelled at this soul crushing

00:09:50.910 --> 00:09:59.459
self-absorption that seems to come over me
whenever I'm pregnant or alive, but I was

00:09:59.459 --> 00:10:06.070
rapt. I was rapt by all of these conversations.
And, um you know, that period of pregnancy

00:10:06.070 --> 00:10:10.940
I don't think I'm unique in feeling like it's
a time of your life where you are completely

00:10:10.940 --> 00:10:16.540
absorbed with navel gazing obvious, for obvious
reasons, because your navel is becoming ever

00:10:16.540 --> 00:10:20.490
more prominent. But you know you spend all
your time that you're not working considering

00:10:20.490 --> 00:10:23.850
being pregnant and rubbing cocoa butter all
over your belly so it's nice to be with other

00:10:23.850 --> 00:10:24.850
people who are doing the same thing.

00:10:24.850 --> 00:10:30.779
So this was a really sweet and supportive
group. Right? We took up a collection for

00:10:30.779 --> 00:10:36.869
that mother of five. We bought her car seats
and strollers and everything she needed to

00:10:36.869 --> 00:10:42.830
have that baby. Whenever anybody shared bad
news, we were always sympathetic. Um, at that,

00:10:42.830 --> 00:10:48.689
those early days, we had yet, most of us to
come across an internet troll. There were,

00:10:48.689 --> 00:10:54.699
I think there were just fewer of them back
then. But even in those halcyon early internet

00:10:54.699 --> 00:10:59.319
days, we got into flame wars. They were over
the usual subjects and usually anybody who

00:10:59.319 --> 00:11:04.360
had spent even an hour on the Mommy websites
knows what they're like; breast feeding versus

00:11:04.360 --> 00:11:09.579
bottle feeding, cloth diapers versus disposable,
the safety of anal sex during pregnancy [laughter]

00:11:09.579 --> 00:11:14.890
okay that was the poly-amorous mom, although
I'm willing to bet there were some people

00:11:14.890 --> 00:11:21.300
who were kind of glad for the sharing of information
on that particular subject. I tried very hard

00:11:21.300 --> 00:11:28.449
not to start flame wars myself, but I do have
to admit that I was fairly often the first

00:11:28.449 --> 00:11:34.560
to launch a spirited defense of any member
who I thought was being unjustly attacked.

00:11:34.560 --> 00:11:38.759
But, like I said, this group never generated
into true hideousness, because, and here's

00:11:38.759 --> 00:11:46.350
the most important part, we were not anonymous.
We all used our real names, and I'm sure that

00:11:46.350 --> 00:11:51.220
it's possible that there was some Julie or
Joanne who was really a troll named Phillip

00:11:51.220 --> 00:11:57.709
wearing crusty boxer shorts and a coffee spattered
wife beater hunched over his laptop in a cockroach-infested

00:11:57.709 --> 00:12:03.540
studio apartment in Van Nuys getting off on
pretending to be a 28-year-old Mormon woman

00:12:03.540 --> 00:12:09.600
from Salt Lake expecting her third baby on
June 14th, it didn't seem likely. And even

00:12:09.600 --> 00:12:14.470
if there was such a troll, that Phillip did
such a good job, you know [laughter] of supporting

00:12:14.470 --> 00:12:19.179
us and talking about his baby that it just
didn't really matter whether he was real or

00:12:19.179 --> 00:12:24.769
not. We believed it and we needed it. And
we got what we were looking for, we got reassurance

00:12:24.769 --> 00:12:31.680
that we were normal, we got someone to listen
to us, we were made to feel, by one another,

00:12:31.680 --> 00:12:38.319
that we were good enough. We were all going
to be good mothers, right? Then, after that

00:12:38.319 --> 00:12:46.029
initial glory days of early internet, I expanded
my web communities beyond this fairly personal

00:12:46.029 --> 00:12:53.399
list and of course the level of discourse
deteriorated. [INAUDIBLE] sense of well being.

00:12:53.399 --> 00:13:06.309
[INAUDIBLE] a show of hands. That's it? [INAUDIBLE]
You people must be so busy.

00:13:06.309 --> 00:13:17.760
[laughter]. You know they still give great
information, you know you can buy discount

00:13:17.760 --> 00:13:25.360
Robeez, those little slippers, but they do
seem to generate all the time and at an ever

00:13:25.360 --> 00:13:31.439
increasing into full pitch hysterical battles,
the subtext of which not only do you and I

00:13:31.439 --> 00:13:39.920
don't agree with each other but your opinion
[INAUDIBLE] and fundamental idiocy makes you

00:13:39.920 --> 00:13:47.370
the worst mother in the world. And it's in
this kind of poisonous sludge in the comments

00:13:47.370 --> 00:13:57.600
section that we're all seeing the worst in
people. I will say that some of the [INAUDIBLE]

00:13:57.600 --> 00:14:03.059
Urban Baby? I've never, I've never gone onto
the discussion board but my husband did after

00:14:03.059 --> 00:14:07.339
he, someone called and said there's some emails
you really need to take a look at this, he

00:14:07.339 --> 00:14:11.980
goes in his office, he comes out after an
hour. He's like pale and shaking and he gets

00:14:11.980 --> 00:14:16.399
me to promise that I will never ever put my
name into the search bar at Urban Baby. [laughter].

00:14:16.399 --> 00:14:28.019
Um, so I got my editor to do it, and she also
was, she's, apparently there's, my favorite

00:14:28.019 --> 00:14:32.019
part of all the horrible things they says
is that whenever anybody says anything nice

00:14:32.019 --> 00:14:37.139
about me or my books someone always says,
according to my editor, 'Hello Ayelet we know

00:14:37.139 --> 00:14:43.040
it's you'. [laughter]. Like I'm spending all
my days on Urban. I mean there was a time

00:14:43.040 --> 00:14:48.989
in my life where I probably would have spent
more time on Urban Baby, but not so much now.

00:14:48.989 --> 00:14:55.129
So during 2005 and 2006 I had a column on
Salon.com that kinda replaced the Andy Lamont

00:14:55.129 --> 00:15:00.019
Mommy column and in that column I wrote on
all sorts of subjects. I wrote on motherhood,

00:15:00.019 --> 00:15:05.529
yes, but I also wrote on, for example, my
own mother's battles with Medicare, the rights

00:15:05.529 --> 00:15:12.499
of juvenile defendants, how much weight I
gain every Christmas season. I tried to be

00:15:12.499 --> 00:15:16.059
timely, I tried to be honest and I tried to
write with humor about difficult subjects.

00:15:16.059 --> 00:15:21.879
By the time I published my second column I
had completely stopped looking at the comments

00:15:21.879 --> 00:15:29.050
section so many people wrote, and while many
responses were sort of vaguely complimentary,

00:15:29.050 --> 00:15:35.139
or even vaguely respectful the vast majority
of them were laced with this unbelievable

00:15:35.139 --> 00:15:40.759
venom, this loathing for everything about
me, and I just couldn't stand to read them

00:15:40.759 --> 00:15:48.709
anymore. For somebody who writes with so much
narcissistic self-absorption, I am very thin-skinned

00:15:48.709 --> 00:15:52.730
and I respond to almost all criticism, at
least personal criticism, by falling into

00:15:52.730 --> 00:15:57.260
a pit of self-loathing where I'm convinced
that the person doing the criticizing is absolutely

00:15:57.260 --> 00:16:04.499
right, and I am as awful as she, and it's
almost always she, says. So, um, but today,

00:16:04.499 --> 00:16:12.399
I'm going to be reading, in the interest of,
you know, full disclosure or whatever, I'm

00:16:12.399 --> 00:16:16.850
going to be reading a bunch of hate mail,
hate comments from Salon. [laughter]. I thought

00:16:16.850 --> 00:16:23.410
that might be fun. so, here's some of the
things, I went and searched that people said

00:16:23.410 --> 00:16:27.470
about me in the comments section. "Yet another
article that reinforces my impression that

00:16:27.470 --> 00:16:34.240
Ayelet Waldman is in laymen's terms a freak!
[laughter]. I hope Salon's remittance goes

00:16:34.240 --> 00:16:38.429
directly into some kind of trust fund to the
poor kid's future psychotherapy." [laughter].

00:16:38.429 --> 00:16:46.439
Here's another one; "Please, with lots of
Es, please, please take her away! She's ruined

00:16:46.439 --> 00:16:51.589
Michael Chabon for me. I'll never read another
of his books, ever! I won't be able to, just

00:16:51.589 --> 00:16:57.860
thinking of him married to her makes me ill!"
[laughter]. And another personal favorite,

00:16:57.860 --> 00:17:02.629
"I always need to take a shower after I read
Ayelet Waldman's pieces." And I assume that

00:17:02.629 --> 00:17:06.800
he's going to go into the shower and beat
off because he's so excited about me [laughter]

00:17:06.800 --> 00:17:12.329
maybe not. Um, but you know look, just even
reading those now, as I'm doing it as a joke,

00:17:12.329 --> 00:17:17.510
but I'm still gives me this, kind of like
ah, in my stomach and I think really, really

00:17:17.510 --> 00:17:23.870
shower, why? Um, that was not, obviously,
my first experience with being loathed on

00:17:23.870 --> 00:17:28.750
the internet, which is, as you can tell, the
subject of today's little talk. Um I had,

00:17:28.750 --> 00:17:33.920
as some of you might have known, might have
ready many, I guess it was about 5 years ago

00:17:33.920 --> 00:17:38.730
now. I published an essay in the New York
Times that really kind of brought me, not

00:17:38.730 --> 00:17:42.490
a lot of people read Salon, so they were haters
on Salon, but with the New York Times, it

00:17:42.490 --> 00:17:49.900
turns out that more than 5 million people
read. And I wrote this essay, I wrote it for

00:17:49.900 --> 00:17:56.880
a literary anthology, and we're going to do
a little experiment now. How many of you have

00:17:56.880 --> 00:18:01.020
ever read a literary anthology? Okay, so,
this is an educated crowd. That was like six

00:18:01.020 --> 00:18:08.610
hands. How many who broke, how many of you
read the whole thing? Yeah. Three. Okay? [laughter].

00:18:08.610 --> 00:18:13.560
There's my point. What happened was two friends
of mine were putting together this literary

00:18:13.560 --> 00:18:17.180
anthology that nobody was going to read and
they, it was all about motherhood and they

00:18:17.180 --> 00:18:22.060
called me and said, alright Ayelet, we've
got mothers writing about divorce, and we've

00:18:22.060 --> 00:18:24.990
got mothers writing about having twins and
we've got mothers writing about breast cancer,

00:18:24.990 --> 00:18:29.160
but we don't have any mother writing about
sex. And since you're the only person we know

00:18:29.160 --> 00:18:35.140
that's having any [laughter] you have to write
about it. And, um I decided that I would for

00:18:35.140 --> 00:18:39.270
this anthology that nobody would read and
at first I wrote this kind of Dr. Ruthie how

00:18:39.270 --> 00:18:43.710
to maintain an intimate relationship with
your husband when you have 4 children piece.

00:18:43.710 --> 00:18:50.420
But the more I got into it, the more I always
can, I can always find that sort of corrosive

00:18:50.420 --> 00:18:55.130
sense of ribbon of self-loathing in every
topic and I realized that this whole idea

00:18:55.130 --> 00:18:59.380
of my sex life made me feel horrible. It made
me feel like an awful mother, it made me feel

00:18:59.380 --> 00:19:05.440
bad about myself, and I wrote about that.
So, I'll just give, I'll read you like the

00:19:05.440 --> 00:19:09.970
very just the first couple of sentences of
it so you can see what this essay was about.

00:19:09.970 --> 00:19:15.410
In case you didn't read it. I have four children,
four children with whom I spend a good part

00:19:15.410 --> 00:19:19.660
of every day bathing them, combing their hair,
sitting with them while they do their homework,

00:19:19.660 --> 00:19:24.890
holding them while the weep their tragic tears,
but I'm not in love with any of them. I'm

00:19:24.890 --> 00:19:29.530
in love with my husband. If a good mother
is one who loves her child more than anyone

00:19:29.530 --> 00:19:35.170
else in the world, well I'm not a good mother.
I am, in fact, a bad mother. I love my husband

00:19:35.170 --> 00:19:39.870
more than I love my children. And it went
on from there, and on.

00:19:39.870 --> 00:19:45.160
Female audience member: I just have to say
one thing.

00:19:45.160 --> 00:19:46.210
Ayelet: Yeah.

00:19:46.210 --> 00:19:52.562
Female audience member: We were talking about
your coming here someone mentioned that incident

00:19:52.562 --> 00:19:55.390
and then a person who's probably here said,
"I love her husband more than kids!" [laughter].

00:19:55.390 --> 00:19:58.921
Ayelet. Well you know, it's interesting, because
that is, I just, just as an aside that, I

00:19:58.921 --> 00:20:05.170
mean that's really what it's about. He's a
really great guy, and moreover he's like,

00:20:05.170 --> 00:20:08.360
he is an absolute 50% share in the domestic
life of our family. So after this essay came

00:20:08.360 --> 00:20:16.690
out in the New York Times and I did not submit
it to the New York Times, they picked it up.

00:20:16.690 --> 00:20:21.860
I got, I mean thousands of emails. And among
the thousands of emails were the emails from

00:20:21.860 --> 00:20:27.320
men saying, "so how do I, you know, make my
wife a little more like you because I haven't

00:20:27.320 --> 00:20:32.760
gotten laid in 3 years. [Laughter]. And, um,
oh and I always wrote to these guys, you know

00:20:32.760 --> 00:20:38.140
like they're looking for me to give them some
secret, you know butterfly position or something,

00:20:38.140 --> 00:20:42.610
but all I said was, you know, you want to
get laid? Here's a trick unload the dishwasher

00:20:42.610 --> 00:20:47.870
my friends. Push the Swiffer around the floor.
There is nothing sexier to a woman with small

00:20:47.870 --> 00:20:53.120
children then a man folding laundry. Right?
That's why I'm so crazy about my husband,

00:20:53.120 --> 00:21:00.030
because I don't cook, I barely clean, he is,
he not only you know works and has a job,

00:21:00.030 --> 00:21:05.780
but he also is responsible for more than half
of the domestic world. So um, when that essay

00:21:05.780 --> 00:21:11.360
came out, I mean I had been toiling in utter
obscurity before then, I mean really I don't

00:21:11.360 --> 00:21:17.210
even know how many, I think my, my murder
mysteries sold in hard cover about 3,500 copies

00:21:17.210 --> 00:21:24.110
each and then a tiny bit more in paper. Really,
nobody knew who I was. And that essay landed

00:21:24.110 --> 00:21:28.620
with this kind of hysterical thud. Um, the
first thing I knew about was a friend of mine

00:21:28.620 --> 00:21:32.880
called me, so it was in the Sunday Times in
the Modern Love column. So a friend of mine

00:21:32.880 --> 00:21:39.110
called me on Monday morning, and she said
don't watch The View. Well, I wasn't planning

00:21:39.110 --> 00:21:48.063
on it. Star Jones is taking off after you,
and I thought Star Jones is critizing my marriage,

00:21:48.063 --> 00:21:52.180
[laughter]. Star Jones who husband's waiving
that rainbow flag and, but, okay. Phone rings

00:21:52.180 --> 00:21:57.370
almost immediately later and it's a friend
of mine calling from a Starbucks in Chicago

00:21:57.370 --> 00:22:02.720
and she's like, I don't know what you did,
but the women at the next table are tearing

00:22:02.720 --> 00:22:06.790
you to shreds. And one of the things about
having one of those names is that it doesn't

00:22:06.790 --> 00:22:12.110
belong to so many people is that all of my
friends all over the country were hearing

00:22:12.110 --> 00:22:16.770
people scream about Ayelet, Ayelet or Eyelet,
Eyelet, Eyelet. Um, my favorite story was

00:22:16.770 --> 00:22:22.080
my agent who was in the Union Square Cafe
in New York city and was talking to her lunchmate

00:22:22.080 --> 00:22:25.760
about the essay and someone from across the
room screamed out, I hate that essay that

00:22:25.760 --> 00:22:31.280
woman is a complete, and then there was a
fight! In the restaurant with people taking

00:22:31.280 --> 00:22:36.930
sides and it's a very quiet, sedate place
and um, my agent was seriously bummed because

00:22:36.930 --> 00:22:39.630
she couldn't go there for like weeks afterwards.

00:22:39.630 --> 00:22:47.080
But, anyway, so and, of course, the web went
insane. Gawker began what had seemed like

00:22:47.080 --> 00:22:53.730
a 6-year devotion to tearing me to shreds.
Um, I don't know what they said there, but

00:22:53.730 --> 00:22:59.360
um, but they were, you know, ridiculing me,
and I actually feel like Gawker is my, every

00:22:59.360 --> 00:23:05.030
time I feel like nobody reads me or I'm not
successful or my career has been a failure,

00:23:05.030 --> 00:23:11.290
at that moment, reliably Gawker will like
publish one of my tweets in this you know

00:23:11.290 --> 00:23:15.840
huge screaming bout of Ayelet loathing. And
it just reminds me that I'm like alive, you

00:23:15.840 --> 00:23:22.760
know, and that I'm still out there. But at
least some neurotic envious crazy 22-year-old

00:23:22.760 --> 00:23:29.280
writer want-to-be in New York City knows who
I am. Um, Andrew Sullivan, who um at the time

00:23:29.280 --> 00:23:33.910
I wasn't so fond of it but then after the
Obama, the election I became very fond of.

00:23:33.910 --> 00:23:39.560
He also took off after me and at one point,
so this stuff, there's stuff on the web, there's

00:23:39.560 --> 00:23:44.630
emails, thousands of emails. The New York
Times is calling saying they've never had

00:23:44.630 --> 00:23:50.110
this much response. It was, they're forwarding
me all these awful and also some great but

00:23:50.110 --> 00:23:55.780
lots of awful emails. And at one point my
husband was kind of lying face down on the

00:23:55.780 --> 00:24:01.590
bed, moaning. Why? Because he had just met
Grail Markus. Do any of you know who Grail

00:24:01.590 --> 00:24:06.840
Markus is? He's one, he's the best writer
about rock and roll in the history of music

00:24:06.840 --> 00:24:10.970
writing. He's, he's um, I would says he the
grandfather but he's not that old. But he's

00:24:10.970 --> 00:24:14.240
like the first guy who wrote about rock and
roll in this really intellectual but also

00:24:14.240 --> 00:24:21.190
fun way and he is an, my husband idolizes
him, and he had just begun to exchange emails

00:24:21.190 --> 00:24:26.410
with him and that morning an email had come
in from Grail Markus that was addressed, Dear

00:24:26.410 --> 00:24:32.300
Sex God. So, my husband was kind of like,
what have you done to me. And, he just rolled

00:24:32.300 --> 00:24:36.840
over and he says, God well, at least I should
be grateful you didn't go on Oprah to talk

00:24:36.840 --> 00:24:42.100
about our sex life. And um, that afternoon
I was like, well honey, do you mean what you

00:24:42.100 --> 00:24:47.920
said because look who's on the phone. And
it was, in fact, the Oprah show and I did

00:24:47.920 --> 00:24:54.980
go to be on Oprah, yes I did. I have nothing
to say in my defense other that I am venal

00:24:54.980 --> 00:25:00.580
and I really really wanted to sell books.
And Oprah sells a lot of books. That's why

00:25:00.580 --> 00:25:04.821
I went. I also went because they told me that
Oprah was on my side, and I thought I was

00:25:04.821 --> 00:25:08.340
going to go on the show and Oprah and I were
going to like have this conversation which

00:25:08.340 --> 00:25:11.770
we talked about how great my points of view
are and how brilliant I am and that I was

00:25:11.770 --> 00:25:19.010
going to go off and sell 800,000 books and
that's not quite what happened. Um, what happened

00:25:19.010 --> 00:25:24.720
was, well start at the beginning, on the plane
to Chicago I got this horrible pimple. Right

00:25:24.720 --> 00:25:31.590
here. And, of course I was like in the bathroom
popping it the whole way, so by the time I

00:25:31.590 --> 00:25:35.840
got to the set of the Oprah show I've got
this like red zit, like, it precedes me into

00:25:35.840 --> 00:25:42.710
the room by a good 3 inches. So all I'm thinking
about at that moment is all, is the makeup

00:25:42.710 --> 00:25:45.620
department on the Oprah show going to be able
to spackle out the rest of my face, so that

00:25:45.620 --> 00:25:51.250
this zit does not cast a shadow. So I don't
really pay attention to what they're saying

00:25:51.250 --> 00:25:57.070
to me, so I don't hear the producers, and
the first thing I really notice that there's

00:25:57.070 --> 00:25:58.770
something wrong is that there's this kind
of like yowling noise a sort of hysterical

00:25:58.770 --> 00:26:02.310
shrieking and I'm in the green room and it
seems to be coming from the vents. And I looked

00:26:02.310 --> 00:26:09.930
at the producer and I'm like what is that
it sounds like the, you know the three witches

00:26:09.930 --> 00:26:21.340
over the cauldron passing their eye back and
forth. [INAUDIBLE] we are assembled a group

00:26:21.340 --> 00:26:29.310
of 24 women, they hate you, there also seems
to be a [INAUDIBLE] defense attorney, Ayelet,

00:26:29.310 --> 00:26:35.360
you'll be fine. So, I go out, so they take
me out on the stage, by the way perfect if

00:26:35.360 --> 00:26:40.750
you go look on the web, no zit, no zit, complete,
I don't know what they did, magic, every time

00:26:40.750 --> 00:26:45.940
I have a pimple now, I ache for them. [laughter]
Um, they lead me out onto this, this sound

00:26:45.940 --> 00:26:49.840
stage and there's like producers all around
me, and as I'm getting on the soundstage,

00:26:49.840 --> 00:26:54.290
they're choosing women from the audience who
can sit up on the stage, and one woman flings

00:26:54.290 --> 00:27:03.690
herself across the seats shrieking, let me
at her! [laughter]. And that's what I saw

00:27:03.690 --> 00:27:08.580
when I got on the stage. It was, it was unbelievable,
I mean these women were so angry, I mean they

00:27:08.580 --> 00:27:13.550
were just, they wanted to, they had been like,
you know, blogging about me for 3 days and

00:27:13.550 --> 00:27:18.530
now was their chance to tear me limb from
limb. And I, I sat there listening to it for

00:27:18.530 --> 00:27:24.750
a little while and I thought, you know what,
I don't need this. I didn't go on Jerry Springer,

00:27:24.750 --> 00:27:29.600
my goal here is to sell books, I don't need
to do this. I am out of here. And I'm just

00:27:29.600 --> 00:27:40.080
about to like undo myself I'm undoing the
mike when this whole end of the sound stage

00:27:40.080 --> 00:27:45.750
opened and in this kind of halo of golden
light [laughter] walks a being, I swear to

00:27:45.750 --> 00:27:53.360
God, from another planet. Oprah just is not
human. I mean her head is bigger than a human

00:27:53.360 --> 00:28:01.810
head. She smells better than a human person,
her skin is like light from within, it glows

00:28:01.810 --> 00:28:08.930
a kind of golden, anyway, I was so, my heart
just stopped. I was like, it was like you

00:28:08.930 --> 00:28:14.040
know, like if you were an absolute born again
Christian and Jesus walked into your bedroom.

00:28:14.040 --> 00:28:20.130
That's what it felt like. [laughter]. So,
she sits down next to me and she leans over

00:28:20.130 --> 00:28:25.560
and in my ear she whispers your husband's
book, the Amazing Adventures of Cavalier and

00:28:25.560 --> 00:28:31.560
Clay, is the best book I've read all year.
And what am I thinking at that moment? I am

00:28:31.560 --> 00:28:37.560
thinking Oprah Book Club! I am thinking four
children's college educations. I am thinking

00:28:37.560 --> 00:28:41.310
I am set, I'm going to be rich, I'm going
to guy a bigger house, it's all. So I am not

00:28:41.310 --> 00:28:47.890
going anywhere. And, the whole time she was
like every break we would be whispering together

00:28:47.890 --> 00:28:52.440
and we were like sharing little jokes and
the women, and the women are totally tearing

00:28:52.440 --> 00:28:57.600
me to shreds. My favorite woman says um, she
raises her hand and says that she has four

00:28:57.600 --> 00:29:00.630
kids but she's a good mother and the reason
that she knows this because she never has

00:29:00.630 --> 00:29:07.990
sex with her husband [laughter] and on the
rare occasions where she allows him to do

00:29:07.990 --> 00:29:14.590
his business, and that is a direct quotation
she watches T.V. [laughter]. Yeah. Okay, so

00:29:14.590 --> 00:29:20.730
you and I, we hear that and we're just like,
what? Oprah hears that and this is why she's

00:29:20.730 --> 00:29:27.110
actually better than all of us, is she without
missing a beat says, what do you watch? [laughter]

00:29:27.110 --> 00:29:33.010
To which the woman replies, Jeopardy. Which,
from now on, every time you watch the show,

00:29:33.010 --> 00:29:38.580
and you think about buying a vowel, O, O,
O, it's going to completely change your life,

00:29:38.580 --> 00:29:44.550
trust me. You'll never see it the same way
again. Alright, so but, you know Oprah did

00:29:44.550 --> 00:29:49.940
agree with me, right? She was on my side and
having Oprah on your side means that all of

00:29:49.940 --> 00:29:54.640
the women in the room by the end of the show
it was like a cruise ship, you know sailing

00:29:54.640 --> 00:29:58.860
along and it just kind of turns around in
the water and it takes about 45 minutes, but

00:29:58.860 --> 00:30:04.170
at the end of the turn they're all like oh,
we love Ayelet. We totally agree with her,

00:30:04.170 --> 00:30:08.910
she's the best friend we've ever had. Um,
and just, I think this whole talk is an aside,

00:30:08.910 --> 00:30:15.180
but just on another aside, so I get off the
stage and I call my husband and I'm like Oh

00:30:15.180 --> 00:30:21.750
my God, Oprah and I connected, in this amazing
way. I mean like I, you know how you meet

00:30:21.750 --> 00:30:24.460
someone and you just know you're going to
be friends? I mean we had that kind of soul

00:30:24.460 --> 00:30:29.530
connection that bond, and you know dude, you
going to have to learn to play golf because

00:30:29.530 --> 00:30:32.810
you're going to be golfing with Stedman while
Oprah and I are hanging [laughter], doing

00:30:32.810 --> 00:30:39.140
girl things. And he's like uh-huh. So, I go
home and I write her this letter like Oprah,

00:30:39.140 --> 00:30:44.362
you and me and the bond and connection and
the soul mates and the instant and the blah,

00:30:44.362 --> 00:30:48.840
blah, blah so blah, and I get this letter
back I swear to God it is mimeographed on

00:30:48.840 --> 00:30:58.250
that purple, I swear to you and it's off center
and it says, Dear Guest, thank you for sharing

00:30:58.250 --> 00:31:07.110
your story. I know. I know, it's so sad. And,
and I really thought, but then, you know,

00:31:07.110 --> 00:31:11.420
just to show you that I'm not a complete moron,
I called up a friend whose book was an Oprah

00:31:11.420 --> 00:31:17.860
Book Club pick and I was like Isabelle, Oprah
Winfrey? And she said, your best friend for

00:31:17.860 --> 00:31:27.250
48 minutes. [Laughter]. And it's true, and
it I know it was real. I know that I wasn't

00:31:27.250 --> 00:31:29.730
the only one in the room, because I think
she felt it, I know she felt it, but only

00:31:29.730 --> 00:31:33.630
for 48 minutes. And then I even met her after,
and this was really the soul crushing thing

00:31:33.630 --> 00:31:37.590
because I thought, at least I'm memorable,
right, if I'm not her best friend, but I met

00:31:37.590 --> 00:31:44.830
her after during the Obama campaign, I'm like
oh, I, and she was like, okay, and clearly

00:31:44.830 --> 00:31:47.810
no recollection at all.

00:31:47.810 --> 00:31:53.940
Anyway, where was I? talking about hate mail?
Okay, so, right. I was talking about how I

00:31:53.940 --> 00:32:00.330
was no neophyte to insults, that I, like,
have been insulted frequently, I live in Berkley,

00:32:00.330 --> 00:32:07.150
people! I know what it's like to be the butt
of other people's insults. Um, but there is

00:32:07.150 --> 00:32:14.730
something really special about the comments
section of the Mommy Blog. There is something

00:32:14.730 --> 00:32:23.590
unique about that vitriol. I think it's like
there's this moment in history, how shall

00:32:23.590 --> 00:32:32.010
I describe it, it's as if when, um, the world,
the stars align in this certain way to create

00:32:32.010 --> 00:32:39.640
the perfect medium for something. So, the
analogy I like to use is dogs and cars. So

00:32:39.640 --> 00:32:44.580
dogs, we have been training canines whatever,
10,000 years I don't know how many tens of

00:32:44.580 --> 00:32:47.800
thousands of years. We have been creating
this thing, took wolves and we made them into

00:32:47.800 --> 00:32:51.690
companions and this whole thing, right and
we did this for whatever reason, for hunting,

00:32:51.690 --> 00:32:57.520
for companionship but, it turned out what,
what a little over 100 years ago, when the

00:32:57.520 --> 00:33:02.620
first automobile was created, that the actual
thing dogs were meant to do, the thing that

00:33:02.620 --> 00:33:06.770
expressed their soul most perfectly was to
stick their head out of an open window on

00:33:06.770 --> 00:33:12.140
the highway and have their tongue waving in
the breeze. Every dog, that's what a dog was

00:33:12.140 --> 00:33:16.250
meant to do, that's the perfect expression
of dogdom and I who would have known until

00:33:16.250 --> 00:33:24.640
we invented the automobile. And that is what
I feel like the internet is for maternal self-loathing.

00:33:24.640 --> 00:33:30.250
I think that we probably always existed. There
was always this kind of you're a horrible

00:33:30.250 --> 00:33:34.650
mother, I'm a horrible mother we eat our hearts
out, but when the internet was created, it

00:33:34.650 --> 00:33:42.210
was this perfect paradigmatic exquisite universe
of bad mother vitriol. Like, the perfect place

00:33:42.210 --> 00:33:47.660
for it. So, like, and I want to be really
clear, I am not a Luddite. I'm not one of

00:33:47.660 --> 00:33:52.950
those people who believe that she's allergic
to Wi-Fi. Do you know there are in fact, people

00:33:52.950 --> 00:33:57.470
who believe that Wi-Fi is called, gives them
migraines, I don't believe that. I love the

00:33:57.470 --> 00:34:01.490
internet. I'm going to read you little list
of recent Google, this is one day's worth

00:34:01.490 --> 00:34:08.050
of Google searches, 1 24-hour period, for
you all. This is what I looked up: The maximum

00:34:08.050 --> 00:34:12.330
speed of a classic single hull wooden schooner;
current presidential polling for Colorado,

00:34:12.330 --> 00:34:17.270
Florida, Ohio and Minnesota -this was during
the election; how incomplete grades are awarded

00:34:17.270 --> 00:34:21.550
in Harvard College; who on my street gave
the maximum donations to which presidential

00:34:21.550 --> 00:34:27.530
candidate; the hours of low tide in Blue Hill,
Maine on July 4th of last year; the square

00:34:27.530 --> 00:34:33.340
footage of the average boxing ring; the hours
of operation of a Two Birds Cafe in San Geronimo;

00:34:33.340 --> 00:34:37.760
what percentage of Americans are idiotic enough
to believe that Barack Obama is Muslim; the

00:34:37.760 --> 00:34:43.570
cost of custom designed vans; the winner of
last year's National's Book Award; the cost

00:34:43.570 --> 00:34:48.360
of a set of sails for above-referenced schooner;
which of Paganini's caprices is more challenging

00:34:48.360 --> 00:34:53.540
to play, number five or number 24; the names
of string quartets; the starting time of the

00:34:53.540 --> 00:34:58.390
movie The Hulk; the relative merits of local
Ethiopian restaurants; Golden Glove rules

00:34:58.390 --> 00:35:02.680
regarding the composition of boxing gloves;
the average weight of 5-year-old American

00:35:02.680 --> 00:35:08.140
boys and the correlation of emaciation with
delayed cognitive development -one of my kids

00:35:08.140 --> 00:35:14.030
doesn't eat; the efficacy of Cetaphil as a
remedy for lice infestation; whether frequent

00:35:14.030 --> 00:35:19.321
lice re-infestation has ever been used as
a justifiable defense in a case of assault;

00:35:19.321 --> 00:35:22.390
the cost of a flight between Oakland, California
and New York City; the cost of a flight between

00:35:22.390 --> 00:35:27.290
New York City and Bangor, Maine; nutritional
information on agave nectar; and the average

00:35:27.290 --> 00:35:31.330
number of puppies in a litter of Dachshunds.
And I don't know if that was complete. That

00:35:31.330 --> 00:35:38.220
was 24 hours of my Google history. And, to
further prove that I'm not a Liddite I was

00:35:38.220 --> 00:35:44.930
an early G-Mail and Google calendars adopter,
maybe not as early as you people, but I was.

00:35:44.930 --> 00:35:51.470
I Tweet, yes, I do, I Facebook and I have
been involved in a myriad of listservs and

00:35:51.470 --> 00:35:57.860
on-line communities. One, for owners of Bernese
Mountain dogs; another for devotees of raw

00:35:57.860 --> 00:36:05.100
dog food -yes be quiet, I know it's stupid.
[laughter] Myriad lists about the 2008 presidential

00:36:05.100 --> 00:36:10.570
elections; one for treatment and caring for
children with ADHD; up-to-the-minute information

00:36:10.570 --> 00:36:15.400
and photographs of women's high-heeled shoes;
the side, one devoted to the side-effects

00:36:15.400 --> 00:36:21.890
of psychotropic medication; one on writing;
one on skin care; one on the proper treatment

00:36:21.890 --> 00:36:27.010
of plantar fasciitis; and I will say that
they all get ugly, all of them. Even, the

00:36:27.010 --> 00:36:33.830
raw food one, definitely. They all get ugly,
but the vitriol is the worst of all, when

00:36:33.830 --> 00:36:40.780
the topic is motherhood. And, um, I don't
know why that is. I mean, other than that

00:36:40.780 --> 00:36:47.320
it's a perfect manifestation of everything
we most hate, I, this kind of nexus conjunction

00:36:47.320 --> 00:36:53.481
of maternal anxiety, misogyny, guilt, leisure,
technology, I don't know what it is, but it

00:36:53.481 --> 00:36:59.780
is a vial place at times. There is even a
study, it's not just me complaining about

00:36:59.780 --> 00:37:03.770
how people h ate me on the internet. The University
of Maryland published a study in 2006 that

00:37:03.770 --> 00:37:09.870
showed that women are 25 times more likely
to be the target of malicious on-line attacks

00:37:09.870 --> 00:37:13.950
than men. This is true. This, so, it's not
just that the web brings out the worst in

00:37:13.950 --> 00:37:21.369
us, it brings out the most misogyny and the
most self-loathing. And like I said, you know,

00:37:21.369 --> 00:37:25.770
maybe it's true that women have always been
nasty to one another, on occasion, but, you

00:37:25.770 --> 00:37:30.000
and maybe now, you know you used to once have
known somebody to be bitchy about her or at

00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:36.280
least know someone who knew her and now, you
can be bitchy about anybody, anywhere who's

00:37:36.280 --> 00:37:44.440
involved in any literary community. But, at
the same time, I think I just, I'm almost

00:37:44.440 --> 00:37:51.060
afraid to say this. If I have any goal in
the time, in the 30 seconds I have left before

00:37:51.060 --> 00:37:54.720
I devote myself to parent-teacher, just to
parent-teacher conference, that's where I'm

00:37:54.720 --> 00:38:02.520
going now [laughter] to question and answer,
God. I just want to call for like a, a cease

00:38:02.520 --> 00:38:10.500
fire, if possible, just a, or at least a raising
of consciousness that we are doing this to

00:38:10.500 --> 00:38:15.850
ourselves and each other and that we're doing
this especially around the topic of motherhood.

00:38:15.850 --> 00:38:20.460
And I know, I'm never going to give up on
the web, I mean on and particularly on those

00:38:20.460 --> 00:38:24.940
listservs. When I was, when Abe was born,
my youngest, has this jaw defect that meant

00:38:24.940 --> 00:38:29.000
he couldn't breast feed and I joined this
listserv called Pump Mom, they're not called

00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:33.890
list serves anymore, Google groups called
Pump Moms, and I got more information from

00:38:33.890 --> 00:38:38.640
those women than I got from every lactation
consultant -yeah, excellent! Than I ever,

00:38:38.640 --> 00:38:43.360
I mean those I paid people a hundred bucks
an hour and got nothing and those Pop Moms

00:38:43.360 --> 00:38:48.860
saw me through 6 months of pumping. So, I'm
not saying we need to stop, you know, joining

00:38:48.860 --> 00:38:53.490
in these motherhood online communities and
I am just begging, and I know what's going

00:38:53.490 --> 00:38:58.560
to happen is Gawker will see this little video
and they'll be like oh Ayelet Waldman, just

00:38:58.560 --> 00:39:04.130
like Rodney King why can't we all just get
along. [laughter] But really, why can't we

00:39:04.130 --> 00:39:10.790
all just get along? Um so with that I'm just
going to open for comments. If you're my mother

00:39:10.790 --> 00:39:25.750
you can criticize me, if you're not my mother
you can criticize me too. Questions.

00:39:25.750 --> 00:39:26.750
[Female audience member]: So since the ensuing
time is the vitriol is less frequent?

00:39:26.750 --> 00:39:30.860
Ayelet: Against me, personally? Yeah. Weirdly,
yes. Um, well yes and no. I mean Google just

00:39:30.860 --> 00:39:38.200
did put Michael and me on named us third most
loathsome literary couple or Gawker, not Google,

00:39:38.200 --> 00:39:40.590
the third most loathsome literary couple.
Which I actually, was kind of pissed off about,

00:39:40.590 --> 00:39:45.370
because, why, why are we only third, why did,
what did Jonathan Safran Foer and Nicole Krauss

00:39:45.370 --> 00:39:51.200
do to be more loathsome than me? I don't think
anything. But, so it still rears it's head,

00:39:51.200 --> 00:39:55.950
but mostly I think that there actually has
been a little bit of a shift in how we think

00:39:55.950 --> 00:40:00.480
about motherhood, in the time between when
I wrote that essay and when the book Bad Mother

00:40:00.480 --> 00:40:05.060
came out, because what I saw a lot of when
Bad Mother, which is just kind of, the book,

00:40:05.060 --> 00:40:12.230
the book Bad Mother is really in a way I have
a kind of a perversity. There is this Yiddish

00:40:12.230 --> 00:40:21.119
word called "oyftsulokhes" which means, you
know like just to spite you, really. So, oyftsulokhes

00:40:21.119 --> 00:40:24.530
you everyone gave me grief for this essay,
oyftsulokhes. I'm going to write a whole book

00:40:24.530 --> 00:40:28.960
on what a bad mother I am. [laughter] See
what happens then. But actually, it's been

00:40:28.960 --> 00:40:34.931
much more positive and I do think it's because
this Good Mother paradigm, that kind of, you

00:40:34.931 --> 00:40:42.420
know the aggressive imposition of the perfect
mother image on women has, there's been a

00:40:42.420 --> 00:40:46.630
little bit of a backlash against it. And I
like to think if I've done anything in my

00:40:46.630 --> 00:40:48.990
literary career, it's going to contribute
to that backlash, so that, um so that now

00:40:48.990 --> 00:40:55.450
I have noticed that the women showing up at
the bake sale with the perfect cupcakes, she's

00:40:55.450 --> 00:41:01.359
the one embarrassed now. So, which I think
is all good. Can I ask you a question? How

00:41:01.359 --> 00:41:03.060
come so many people at Google wear Google-labeled
attire? [Laughter]

00:41:03.060 --> 00:41:04.060
[Off microphone]: It's free. It's comfortable.

00:41:04.060 --> 00:41:08.440
Ayelet: It's free. Excellent. I don't notice
any Google attire in my schwag bag, but I

00:41:08.440 --> 00:41:12.650
don't know. Fleece vest. Anybody else?

00:41:12.650 --> 00:41:18.790
[off microphone]: So I was not a mother when
your article came out so I don't know the

00:41:18.790 --> 00:41:19.790
controversy.

00:41:19.790 --> 00:41:20.790
Ayelet: Uh. Huh.

00:41:20.790 --> 00:41:21.790
[off microphone]: Of course I'll go look it
up when I get back. What were people so upset

00:41:21.790 --> 00:41:26.660
about. You read that intro and so.

00:41:26.660 --> 00:41:34.050
Ayelet: Why, why do they get so angry?

00:41:34.050 --> 00:41:41.440
[off microphone]: What were they so angry
about?

00:41:41.440 --> 00:41:47.060
Ayelet. You know, it's so interesting, I think
it, I had a conversation with a friend of

00:41:47.060 --> 00:41:51.940
mine's who's a, writes for the magazine section
of the New York Times named Lisa Belkin. And

00:41:51.940 --> 00:41:57.790
she wrote a piece oh probably almost a decade
ago, maybe 6 or 7 years ago about, it was

00:41:57.790 --> 00:42:05.050
a cover magazine piece about um, privileged
mostly white women going back to work; leaving

00:42:05.050 --> 00:42:10.470
work and going back home. Like you know, all
these successful women leaving their successful

00:42:10.470 --> 00:42:13.620
jobs and becoming stay-at-home mothers. I
don't know if any of you remember that piece.

00:42:13.620 --> 00:42:21.430
And she got so much grief for that. I mean
hate mail and so much of it. There was this

00:42:21.430 --> 00:42:26.940
one ridiculous instance where her mother was
the dean of a college was sitting in the college

00:42:26.940 --> 00:42:31.440
cafeteria and these two women were like, raging
about how Lisa, and they said, "She's just

00:42:31.440 --> 00:42:36.770
jealous because says, she's just a stay-at-home
mom." And her mother -because she's her mother-

00:42:36.770 --> 00:42:42.970
couldn't resist said excuse me, "My daughter
writes for the New York Times Magazine. She

00:42:42.970 --> 00:42:48.220
actually writes cover pieces. They don't usually
just let you do that if you're a stay-at-home

00:42:48.220 --> 00:42:52.460
mom, in your pajamas. Yeah, that's actually
a career people." Idiots. But anyway, when

00:42:52.460 --> 00:42:58.830
I was talking to Lisa, I asked her why she's
not hurt these people got so angry and she

00:42:58.830 --> 00:43:03.430
said thought that she had had this experience
that anytime you write about women of our

00:43:03.430 --> 00:43:06.940
generation, women in their 30's and 40's now
into their 50s it's like you're writing a

00:43:06.940 --> 00:43:13.340
Rorschach blot. What you say is nowhere near
as important as what they are experiencing.

00:43:13.340 --> 00:43:19.690
They like, they read they're lives and a criticism
of their lives. Everybody is so knotted up

00:43:19.690 --> 00:43:24.230
with this sense that they're screwing up somehow.
That they read anything as an indictment.

00:43:24.230 --> 00:43:31.020
And I think you know, they're probably, you
know so what am I writing? I'm writing like,

00:43:31.020 --> 00:43:35.020
hey I'm gettin laid, you're not gettin laid,
and why is that. I mean that's already offensive

00:43:35.020 --> 00:43:38.501
you know, like I. Well, I'm not, just because
I'm not getting laid, doesn't mean I'm not

00:43:38.501 --> 00:43:42.359
better than you. You know. So I think there
was a little bit of that but I think fundamentally,

00:43:42.359 --> 00:43:51.920
any time you talk about parenting, the, we
as readers tend to look on those, those words

00:43:51.920 --> 00:43:56.780
as somehow personal attacks. It's not just
that somebody else lives her life, it's an

00:43:56.780 --> 00:43:59.300
indictment of the way we live our lives and
we're so anxious and neurotic about that in

00:43:59.300 --> 00:44:03.750
particular, that it's a causes this kind of
eruption. The only thing I can think of, otherwise,

00:44:03.750 --> 00:44:09.550
who cares, really? You read something by someone
disagree with and you think, ugh, what an

00:44:09.550 --> 00:44:14.800
idiot, and move on. I actually had a woman
come to me at a book signing a year after

00:44:14.800 --> 00:44:18.609
the essay had come out and said, my husband
made me come. And this was a book signing

00:44:18.609 --> 00:44:24.109
where you had to buy the book for $25 and
have lunch. Like you had to be in my presence

00:44:24.109 --> 00:44:29.720
for an hour and you had to pay $25 bucks.
That's not nothing. Right? And she said um,

00:44:29.720 --> 00:44:34.530
she said my um, my husband because he says
I won't stop talking about you and I've been

00:44:34.530 --> 00:44:39.160
so obsessed with you and so angry that he
just felt like I needed to finally confront

00:44:39.160 --> 00:44:46.090
you. And I'm just like, what is your? Get
Over It! You know, God. Okay, hate me, whatever,

00:44:46.090 --> 00:44:51.010
but really, is it really so important. But,
I do think it's that element of, you know

00:44:51.010 --> 00:44:56.900
of just writing, writing this Rorschach blot.
They were just reading something, they were

00:44:56.900 --> 00:45:04.960
reading something other than what I had written
or what I had written had triggered something

00:45:04.960 --> 00:45:08.860
in them? Yes, anybody? The men, both men,
we should call on them. Ooh three men. Yes,

00:45:08.860 --> 00:45:09.860
sir.

00:45:09.860 --> 00:45:14.570
[off microphone]: I just wanted to ask you
sort of a man related, your husband Mike writes

00:45:14.570 --> 00:45:17.850
essays about men and.

00:45:17.850 --> 00:45:19.500
Ayelet: Fatherhood.

00:45:19.500 --> 00:45:23.990
[off microphone] Fatherhood. Does he get any
of the same kind of?

00:45:23.990 --> 00:45:27.440
Ayelet. Oh, no! He's God incarnate. Michael
writes, it's the same this as like, well he

00:45:27.440 --> 00:45:32.080
is a father, right? My, my favorite story
is when he's standing on line in a cafe, he's

00:45:32.080 --> 00:45:35.270
got the baby in a baby Bjorn and he's just
getting coffee. That's all he's doing. Not

00:45:35.270 --> 00:45:40.880
paying attention to that baby, he is getting
coffee, right? Getting coffee. He might even

00:45:40.880 --> 00:45:51.140
spill the coffee on the baby, [laughter] who
knows. And some woman taps him on the shoulder

00:45:51.140 --> 00:45:52.790
and she's like oh, you are such a good dad.
And I'm like, you really, what would you have

00:45:52.790 --> 00:45:56.791
to do as a mother to have someone in the street
tell you you are such a good mom, and I know

00:45:56.791 --> 00:46:03.260
what it is, okay? You have to perform an emergency
tracheotomy with you Bic pen on one kid, while

00:46:03.260 --> 00:46:07.700
breast feeding another [laughter] and helping
the third with their homework. Then you'd

00:46:07.700 --> 00:46:08.760
get the good mom thing. Other than that, nothing.
So his essays, and yes he's a better writer

00:46:08.760 --> 00:46:16.180
than I am. Maybe that has something to do
with it, but people are just like, Oh he's

00:46:16.180 --> 00:46:22.820
so wonderful. He's such a great dad. And he
can, nobody ever gives him grief for revealing

00:46:22.820 --> 00:46:35.160
stuff about our children, even though he does,
and, it's just so unfair.

00:46:35.160 --> 00:46:45.351
[off microphone]: You mentioned, you talked
about earlier one of the reasons you thought

00:46:45.351 --> 00:46:46.351
the listservs, the original listservs, to
be more civil was because people were under

00:46:46.351 --> 00:46:47.351
their real names.

00:46:47.351 --> 00:46:48.351
Ayelet: Yeah.

00:46:48.351 --> 00:46:49.351
[off microphone]: [inaudible]

00:46:49.351 --> 00:46:50.351
Ayelet: Yeah. The New York Times, well see
the New York Times letters were primarily

00:46:50.351 --> 00:46:51.920
positive. They were overwhelmingly positive,
really. The stuff that you, that actually

00:46:51.920 --> 00:46:56.640
went to the New York Times, where you have
to sign your name, was mostly fan mail. Its

00:46:56.640 --> 00:47:01.000
the stuff that comes to me that could be anonymous
that was so loathsome. And the stuff that

00:47:01.000 --> 00:47:05.550
went on the comments section. So I just think
anonymity has a lot to do with it. I mean

00:47:05.550 --> 00:47:11.369
look, if you come up to someone's face and
say my name is Ayelet Waldman and I think

00:47:11.369 --> 00:47:17.430
you're fat and ugly [laughter] is really different
from like, it's 2:00 in the morning and you're

00:47:17.430 --> 00:47:22.150
in your pajamas and my name is Badmomma and
I think you're fat and ugly. It's just a lot

00:47:22.150 --> 00:47:28.019
easier to do that, so, I think anonymity plays
a large part in it. But I do think there is,

00:47:28.019 --> 00:47:33.870
I mean there has been this, you know, disastrous
thing that's happened to civility. I mean,

00:47:33.870 --> 00:47:40.400
I there are a some people who say awful things
on the web who are awful people. I'm sure

00:47:40.400 --> 00:47:44.280
that's true. But, there are a lot of people
who say awful things on the web who are not

00:47:44.280 --> 00:47:50.369
awful people and there's just something about
that environment, that stew, that toxic sludge

00:47:50.369 --> 00:47:54.230
that is contagious. I mean, I know that I
have participated, like I said in inflamed

00:47:54.230 --> 00:47:59.680
battles, and then I found myself saying, what
are you doing, did you really say, and then

00:47:59.680 --> 00:48:06.099
I have to go apologize. Like one time I, no
I won't take the time, but, you know, so I

00:48:06.099 --> 00:48:10.140
think, I do think this, this, there's something
particular about the web and anonymity plays

00:48:10.140 --> 00:48:15.820
a large part in that that makes it so much
easier to be your worse self. Anybody else?

00:48:15.820 --> 00:48:16.820
Yes.

00:48:16.820 --> 00:48:25.020
[off microphone]: So, I'm just curious about
that. The essay, the problem with that.

00:48:25.020 --> 00:48:26.860
Ayelet: Um hmm.

00:48:26.860 --> 00:48:30.517
[off microphone]: Was it that you didn't love
your kids enough?

00:48:30.517 --> 00:48:31.517
Ayelet: Well no it was.

00:48:31.517 --> 00:48:32.517
[off microphone]: Or was it you loved your
husband too much?

00:48:32.517 --> 00:48:33.517
Ayelet: That bothered people, in particular?

00:48:33.517 --> 00:48:34.517
[off microphone]: Yeah, what was the thing
that bugged 'em?

00:48:34.517 --> 00:48:37.880
Ayelet. Well, I mean I think there was one
line that was particularly problematic. I

00:48:37.880 --> 00:48:41.420
had just finished writing this book called
Love and Other Impossible Pursuits, the one

00:48:41.420 --> 00:48:45.360
that's going to be a movie staring Natalie,
it is a movie staring Natalie Portman, out

00:48:45.360 --> 00:48:48.970
sometime before the end of the year in your
local theater. It will probably be there for

00:48:48.970 --> 00:48:53.490
a minute and a half, so go that weekend. It's
a fabulous movie.

00:48:53.490 --> 00:48:54.490
[off microphone]: [inaudible] by Sandra Bullock.

00:48:54.490 --> 00:48:55.490
Ayelet: Yes, that too, but it's.

00:48:55.490 --> 00:48:56.490
[off microphone]: [inaudible] movie?

00:48:56.490 --> 00:48:57.490
Ayelet: It's a great movie too, do both, do
both, great movie. Um, what was I saying?

00:48:57.490 --> 00:48:58.490
[off microphone]: The one sentence.

00:48:58.490 --> 00:49:04.970
Ayelet: Oh, so the one sentence, so I had
just finished this book and and that's the

00:49:04.970 --> 00:49:08.920
book about a woman who's baby dies of SIDS.
And I had been immersed for a year in this

00:49:08.920 --> 00:49:14.900
world of like, of maternal grief. What does
it feel like when your baby dies. And what

00:49:14.900 --> 00:49:19.540
I wrote in that essay was that while I could
image, like I could, I could run a movie,

00:49:19.540 --> 00:49:24.640
I always run these movies in my head, sort
of the worst case scenario movies and all

00:49:24.640 --> 00:49:28.590
these terrible things that happen, you know
every time my kid goes on a bike ride I'm

00:49:28.590 --> 00:49:30.570
you know is there a child molester down the,
and I could run these movies of their death.

00:49:30.570 --> 00:49:39.210
While I can could run that movie in my head
and see the other end, I had no, I have no

00:49:39.210 --> 00:49:43.120
capacity to imagine what my life would even
be like without my husband, like I can see

00:49:43.120 --> 00:49:48.180
having a life, God forbid is what I wrote,
but I can't see that, without, if my husband

00:49:48.180 --> 00:49:52.513
had died. And I think that it made people,
that it felt to people that I was saying I

00:49:52.513 --> 00:49:55.960
would throw my kids in front of the bus to
save my husband's life, which I obviously

00:49:55.960 --> 00:50:00.940
wasn't saying. And also, there's this great
quote by Nietzsche. You didn't think I was

00:50:00.940 --> 00:50:06.590
going to quote Nietzsche did you, but I am,
[laughter]. Um, it requires a shattering exaggeration

00:50:06.590 --> 00:50:10.930
for the world to hear even half the truth.
And I think that part of what I was doing

00:50:10.930 --> 00:50:16.700
in that essay. Like, you know, I was responding
to this thing that I saw and so my response

00:50:16.700 --> 00:50:20.650
was, do I really love my husband more than
my kids? No, you know, how do you compare

00:50:20.650 --> 00:50:25.440
that? I don't want to sleep with my children.
I don't want to have sex with my children

00:50:25.440 --> 00:50:30.390
or sleep with them frankly, but [laughter]
you know, and I do want to have sex and sleep

00:50:30.390 --> 00:50:33.730
with my husband. So you just like varied different
kinds of love and you can't compare them.

00:50:33.730 --> 00:50:39.090
So, really that's sort of the truth, but what
I was responding to was a world of hierarchies

00:50:39.090 --> 00:50:44.935
and that's why I spoke in a language of hierarchies
and that's what, I think made people so angry.

00:50:44.935 --> 00:50:45.935
Let's take one more question and let's let
you people go back to work. Someone be the

00:50:45.935 --> 00:50:46.935
last question after I've said this.

00:50:46.935 --> 00:50:47.935
[off microphone]: I really about the Rorschach
comment about how people hear and I feel like

00:50:47.935 --> 00:50:48.935
no matter how carefully I couch things the
other mother is -we don't watch TV in our

00:50:48.935 --> 00:50:49.935
household- the reason we don't watch TV is
because my youngest before she could read

00:50:49.935 --> 00:50:50.935
could identify words like 'Lexus', BMW and
Porsche. This child is just, she sees brands

00:50:50.935 --> 00:50:51.935
and she consumes them. We watch movies, we
do computers, we not such purists but we don't

00:50:51.935 --> 00:50:52.935
want that. This other mother was going to
have them all over and my kid is younger and

00:50:52.935 --> 00:50:53.935
they were all going to be watching TV and
it's TV for 13 year olds my kid is six and

00:50:53.935 --> 00:50:54.935
I'm like, "Well you know", and I say, "Here's
the [INAUDIBLE] that's a problem. So we don't

00:50:54.935 --> 00:50:55.935
watch a whole lot of TV with her. Well she
sent me an email saying that they watched

00:50:55.935 --> 00:50:56.935
"The Simpsons" last night. It was a special
episode about Jerusalem and they had a really

00:50:56.935 --> 00:50:57.935
important family conversation about it. That
she can't wait until her youngest is old enough

00:50:57.935 --> 00:51:09.480
to watch "The Simpsons" so they can all share
that together. And, in fact, she thinks "The

00:51:09.480 --> 00:51:49.280
Simpsons" I quote, "is a national treasure".

00:51:49.280 --> 00:52:05.840
Ayelet: I mean I think "The Simpsons" is the
national treasure too, but do I feel like

00:52:05.840 --> 00:52:10.910
there's anything wrong with it? You mean,
but that's just it, what she heard was not

00:52:10.910 --> 00:52:16.060
my daughter is such a nut job that we can't
watch T.V. otherwise she's going to be like

00:52:16.060 --> 00:52:20.220
insisting that she get Captain Crunch for
breakfast. What she heard was, what's wrong

00:52:20.220 --> 00:52:24.300
with you, that you let your children watch
T.V.? And that's what we always hear, right?

00:52:24.300 --> 00:52:30.320
We don't ever hear this is how I do things,
we hear, you're doing it wrong. And it's just

00:52:30.320 --> 00:52:34.460
crazy. It's crazy. I don't know how to make
it stop, because I do the same thing, I swear,

00:52:34.460 --> 00:52:38.930
if you, my kids um only watch T.V. on the
weekends, but they're allowed to watch whatever

00:52:38.930 --> 00:52:43.320
they want. If you, I feel so guilty about
that, I bet I would have been like, "The Simpsons"

00:52:43.320 --> 00:52:48.310
is a national treasure! [laughter] Or, I would
have felt it in my heart, but because I'd

00:52:48.310 --> 00:52:54.180
written this whole book urging people to put
breaks on their internal, you know, not to

00:52:54.180 --> 00:52:58.619
say bad things only about themselves in public
then I would never have said it. But it, it's

00:52:58.619 --> 00:53:04.680
like that thing, you know and I missed this,
it's all about her own anxiety, it has nothing

00:53:04.680 --> 00:53:06.770
to do with you and your kid.

00:53:06.770 --> 00:53:13.320
Um, so thank you all for coming. Thank you.
I have to give a special shout out to the

00:53:13.320 --> 00:53:17.741
men in the audience, just because oh my God,
how brave and wonderful. [Laughter]. Um, or

00:53:17.741 --> 00:53:22.800
else, just how lazy, and you really didn't.
Or, you wanted to know how to get laid, and

00:53:22.800 --> 00:53:29.400
you thought this would be the perfect opportunity.
[Laughter] I have they're mostly home cleaning

00:53:29.400 --> 00:53:33.910
related, so come and see me after. Thanks,
guys.
