00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
The answer is the third choice.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
We're only looking for signatures here, so we don't need to encrypt the document.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
We don't care about confidentiality.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000
We can send the document in clear, but what we want to send along with it

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000
is something that proves that it's the document that Alice intended.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000
To do that we need to do something that uses Alice's private key.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
That's these two options.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
If we use the public key--well, anyone can do that.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
The public key could be known to anyone else.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
We're assuming that the private key is only known to Alice.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
The only one who could compute these two things would be Alice

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
Then we have a choice of which one of these two things is better.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:40.000
If we believe we can have one-way hash functions that have the collision resistance

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
properties that we talked about.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.000
Then this is much better, because the output of the hash function is

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
small fixed-size value.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000
It's only for a given security level. It might be 256 bits.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
We can encrypt that much more cheaply than if we had to encrypt the whole document

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
using RSA.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:03.000
That's why this is the best choice, and lot's of protocols are based on this kind of solution

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.000
where we use RSA to encrypt something small, which could be a hash value

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
or it could be an encryption key.

00:01:10.000 --> 99:59:59.000
Then we use that with symmetric crypto for the rest of the message.
