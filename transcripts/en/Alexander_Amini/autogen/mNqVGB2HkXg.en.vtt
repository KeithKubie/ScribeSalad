I'm trying to say but I am trying to say
 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:52.430
I'm trying to say but I am trying to say
that you know although there's a lot of

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440
that you know although there's a lot of
 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:55.160
that you know although there's a lot of
exciting things that we can do with deep

well and so I hope to today talk to you

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100
well and so I hope to today talk to you
 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:08.180
well and so I hope to today talk to you
about you know kind of what is an area

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:08.190
about you know kind of what is an area
 

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:10.310
about you know kind of what is an area
of a boundary that we we're not able to

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320
of a boundary that we we're not able to
 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.710
of a boundary that we we're not able to
break through at this time that I think

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720
break through at this time that I think
 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:16.010
break through at this time that I think
is is critical for machine intelligence

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020
is is critical for machine intelligence
 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:19.580

announcing simulators for 50 on the
 

00:03:05.769 --> 00:03:08.129
announcing simulators for 50 on the
order of 50 cubits and the difference

00:03:08.129 --> 00:03:08.139
order of 50 cubits and the difference
 

00:03:08.139 --> 00:03:09.449
order of 50 cubits and the difference
here is that we're talking about an

00:03:09.449 --> 00:03:09.459
here is that we're talking about an
 

00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:13.709
here is that we're talking about an
actual 50 cubit quantum computer so we

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:13.719
actual 50 cubit quantum computer so we
 

00:03:13.719 --> 00:03:15.869
actual 50 cubit quantum computer so we
we also have the simulators but we have

00:03:15.869 --> 00:03:15.879
we also have the simulators but we have
 

00:03:15.879 --> 00:03:17.459
we also have the simulators but we have
the real quantum computers I think

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:17.469
the real quantum computers I think
 

00:03:17.469 --> 00:03:19.619
the real quantum computers I think
what's also unique about what we're

00:03:19.619 --> 00:03:19.629
what's also unique about what we're
 

00:03:19.629 --> 00:03:23.189
what's also unique about what we're
doing is that we are also making our

00:03:23.189 --> 00:03:23.199
doing is that we are also making our
 

00:03:23.199 --> 00:03:25.199
doing is that we are also making our
quantum computing capabilities available

00:03:25.199 --> 00:03:25.209
quantum computing capabilities available
 

00:03:25.209 --> 00:03:27.059
quantum computing capabilities available
through the cloud so that people can

00:03:27.059 --> 00:03:27.069
through the cloud so that people can
 

00:03:27.069 --> 00:03:28.740
through the cloud so that people can
kind of login and they can experiment

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:28.750
kind of login and they can experiment
 

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:31.199
kind of login and they can experiment
and learn about what quantum computing

00:03:31.199 --> 00:03:31.209
and learn about what quantum computing
 

00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:33.659
and learn about what quantum computing
is it's a very exciting program for us

00:03:33.659 --> 00:03:33.669
is it's a very exciting program for us
 

00:03:33.669 --> 00:03:36.770
is it's a very exciting program for us
we also in 2017 we were able to show

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:36.780
we also in 2017 we were able to show
 

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:40.710
we also in 2017 we were able to show
near linear scale out in terms of you

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:40.720
near linear scale out in terms of you
 

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:43.800
near linear scale out in terms of you
know cafe deep learning models on on our

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:43.810
know cafe deep learning models on on our
 

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:47.159
know cafe deep learning models on on our
servers we were able to show algorithms

00:03:47.159 --> 00:03:47.169
servers we were able to show algorithms
 

00:03:47.169 --> 00:03:50.939
servers we were able to show algorithms
that were able to exploit the quantum

00:03:50.939 --> 00:03:50.949
that were able to exploit the quantum
 

00:03:50.949 --> 00:03:54.360
that were able to exploit the quantum
advantage so the idea is that if you in

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:54.370
advantage so the idea is that if you in
 

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:57.780
advantage so the idea is that if you in
order to actually get the speed ups on

00:03:57.780 --> 00:03:57.790
order to actually get the speed ups on
 

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:00.149
order to actually get the speed ups on
quantum computers you need to be able to

00:04:00.149 --> 00:04:00.159
quantum computers you need to be able to
 

00:04:00.159 --> 00:04:03.599
quantum computers you need to be able to
map problems into a form where you can

00:04:03.599 --> 00:04:03.609
map problems into a form where you can
 

00:04:03.609 --> 00:04:05.219
map problems into a form where you can
get that acceleration and when you get

00:04:05.219 --> 00:04:05.229
get that acceleration and when you get
 

00:04:05.229 --> 00:04:06.599
get that acceleration and when you get
that acceleration then you're talking

00:04:06.599 --> 00:04:06.609
that acceleration then you're talking
 

00:04:06.609 --> 00:04:09.149
that acceleration then you're talking
about exponential accelerations over

00:04:09.149 --> 00:04:09.159
about exponential accelerations over
 

00:04:09.159 --> 00:04:10.439
about exponential accelerations over
traditional computers that people are

00:04:10.439 --> 00:04:10.449
traditional computers that people are
 

00:04:10.449 --> 00:04:12.839
traditional computers that people are
using today so this particular result

the order of times that it takes humans
 

00:08:49.100 --> 00:08:52.030
the order of times that it takes humans
to recognize certain actions as well so

00:08:52.030 --> 00:08:52.040
to recognize certain actions as well so
 

00:08:52.040 --> 00:08:53.770
to recognize certain actions as well so
we're we're kind of sticking with that

00:08:53.770 --> 00:08:53.780
we're we're kind of sticking with that
 

00:08:53.780 --> 00:08:54.290

far was how to segment images how to

00:09:05.990 --> 00:09:06.000
far was how to segment images how to
 

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:08.090
far was how to segment images how to
find objects within images how to

00:09:08.090 --> 00:09:08.100
find objects within images how to
 

00:09:08.100 --> 00:09:10.759

actions and the reason why we also think

00:09:13.730 --> 00:09:13.740
actions and the reason why we also think
 

00:09:13.740 --> 00:09:15.530
actions and the reason why we also think
that actions are important is because

00:09:15.530 --> 00:09:15.540
that actions are important is because
 

00:09:15.540 --> 00:09:17.509
that actions are important is because
they are composable right so we want to

00:09:17.509 --> 00:09:17.519
they are composable right so we want to
 

00:09:17.519 --> 00:09:19.430
they are composable right so we want to
be able to learn not just elemental

00:09:19.430 --> 00:09:19.440
be able to learn not just elemental
 

00:09:19.440 --> 00:09:21.410
be able to learn not just elemental
actions from these videos but then to

00:09:21.410 --> 00:09:21.420
actions from these videos but then to
 

00:09:21.420 --> 00:09:24.139
actions from these videos but then to
start to think about how you recognize

00:09:24.139 --> 00:09:24.149
start to think about how you recognize
 

00:09:24.149 --> 00:09:26.840
start to think about how you recognize
and attack compositions of actions and

00:09:26.840 --> 00:09:26.850
and attack compositions of actions and
 

00:09:26.850 --> 00:09:29.389
and attack compositions of actions and
procedures that people are performing

00:09:29.389 --> 00:09:29.399
procedures that people are performing
 

00:09:29.399 --> 00:09:31.389
procedures that people are performing
because then we can use that to start to

00:09:31.389 --> 00:09:31.399
because then we can use that to start to
 

00:09:31.399 --> 00:09:35.540
because then we can use that to start to
teach the computers to also perform

00:09:35.540 --> 00:09:35.550
teach the computers to also perform
 

00:09:35.550 --> 00:09:38.630
teach the computers to also perform
those procedures or to help humans to be

00:09:38.630 --> 00:09:38.640
those procedures or to help humans to be
 

00:09:38.640 --> 00:09:43.630
those procedures or to help humans to be
able to perform those procedures better

okay now what I want to do is maybe take
 

00:09:46.980 --> 00:09:48.949
okay now what I want to do is maybe take
a break from kind of the set up and get

00:09:48.949 --> 00:09:48.959
a break from kind of the set up and get
 

00:09:48.959 --> 00:09:50.960
a break from kind of the set up and get

conduct procedures within those there's
 

00:11:36.550 --> 00:11:38.760
conduct procedures within those there's
not enough data out there on those

00:11:38.760 --> 00:11:38.770
not enough data out there on those
 

00:11:38.770 --> 00:11:40.470

label data and can we can we address
 

00:12:01.480 --> 00:12:03.320
label data and can we can we address
that can we make the algorithms better

00:12:03.320 --> 00:12:03.330
that can we make the algorithms better
 

00:12:03.330 --> 00:12:05.640
that can we make the algorithms better
the second thing is that you've probably

00:12:05.640 --> 00:12:05.650
the second thing is that you've probably
 

00:12:05.650 --> 00:12:07.110
the second thing is that you've probably
realized that you you train up the

00:12:07.110 --> 00:12:07.120
realized that you you train up the
 

00:12:07.120 --> 00:12:08.370
realized that you you train up the
algorithms and then they're able to

00:12:08.370 --> 00:12:08.380
algorithms and then they're able to
 

00:12:08.380 --> 00:12:10.800
algorithms and then they're able to
perform some tasks the tasks are getting

00:12:10.800 --> 00:12:10.810
perform some tasks the tasks are getting
 

00:12:10.810 --> 00:12:12.840
perform some tasks the tasks are getting
more and more sophisticated self-driving

00:12:12.840 --> 00:12:12.850
more and more sophisticated self-driving
 

00:12:12.850 --> 00:12:15.170
more and more sophisticated self-driving
cars and so on but you're still not

00:12:15.170 --> 00:12:15.180
cars and so on but you're still not
 

00:12:15.180 --> 00:12:17.280
cars and so on but you're still not
training this network so that it can

00:12:17.280 --> 00:12:17.290
training this network so that it can
 

00:12:17.290 --> 00:12:20.160
training this network so that it can
perform many different tasks and even

00:12:20.160 --> 00:12:20.170
perform many different tasks and even
 

00:12:20.170 --> 00:12:23.160
perform many different tasks and even
more importantly what happens is that

00:12:23.160 --> 00:12:23.170
more importantly what happens is that
 

00:12:23.170 --> 00:12:24.900
more importantly what happens is that
you learn a model and even though you

00:12:24.900 --> 00:12:24.910
you learn a model and even though you
 

00:12:24.910 --> 00:12:26.520
you learn a model and even though you
may as part of the training you may have

00:12:26.520 --> 00:12:26.530
may as part of the training you may have
 

00:12:26.530 --> 00:12:27.600
may as part of the training you may have
reinforcement learning

00:12:27.600 --> 00:12:27.610
reinforcement learning
 

00:12:27.610 --> 00:12:30.210
reinforcement learning
that's not lifelong learning that's not

00:12:30.210 --> 00:12:30.220
that's not lifelong learning that's not
 

00:12:30.220 --> 00:12:32.130
that's not lifelong learning that's not
just you know turning the cars out on

00:12:32.130 --> 00:12:32.140
just you know turning the cars out on
 

00:12:32.140 --> 00:12:33.900
just you know turning the cars out on
the road and enabling them to continue

00:12:33.910 --> 00:12:37.110
the road and enabling them to continue
to learn and aggregate information and

00:12:37.110 --> 00:12:37.120
to learn and aggregate information and
 

00:12:37.120 --> 00:12:38.970
to learn and aggregate information and
bring that into a representation so that

00:12:38.970 --> 00:12:38.980
bring that into a representation so that
 

00:12:38.980 --> 00:12:40.830
bring that into a representation so that
they can adapt to you know

00:12:40.830 --> 00:12:40.840
they can adapt to you know
 

00:12:40.840 --> 00:12:42.570
they can adapt to you know

that change over time another thing is
 

00:12:44.920 --> 00:12:46.500
that change over time another thing is
that you know when we train these

00:12:46.500 --> 00:12:46.510
that you know when we train these
 

00:12:46.510 --> 00:12:47.880
that you know when we train these
networks you kind of get it down to a

00:12:47.880 --> 00:12:47.890
networks you kind of get it down to a
 

00:12:47.890 --> 00:12:51.440
networks you kind of get it down to a
certain error rate but how do you keep

00:12:51.440 --> 00:12:51.450
certain error rate but how do you keep
 

00:12:51.450 --> 00:12:54.150
certain error rate but how do you keep
improving the accuracy even though the

00:12:54.150 --> 00:12:54.160
improving the accuracy even though the
 

00:12:54.160 --> 00:12:55.670
improving the accuracy even though the
error rates not that bad

00:12:55.670 --> 00:12:55.680
error rates not that bad
 

00:12:55.680 --> 00:12:57.870

the case may be so we need to try to
 

00:13:14.770 --> 00:13:16.860
the case may be so we need to try to
think about how can we build machines

00:13:16.860 --> 00:13:16.870
think about how can we build machines
 

00:13:16.870 --> 00:13:17.620

how do you go from text to real valued

00:14:15.910 --> 00:14:15.920
how do you go from text to real valued
 

00:14:15.920 --> 00:14:17.740
how do you go from text to real valued
information that can then be fed into

00:14:17.740 --> 00:14:17.750
information that can then be fed into
 

00:14:17.750 --> 00:14:20.559

these algorithms over time and then
 

00:14:20.569 --> 00:14:23.050

computed on so one of the you know the
 

00:14:23.060 --> 00:14:26.259

first areas here is is word embeddings

00:14:26.259 --> 00:14:26.269
first areas here is is word embeddings
 

00:14:26.269 --> 00:14:29.170
first areas here is is word embeddings
the reason i italicized word is because

00:14:29.170 --> 00:14:29.180
the reason i italicized word is because
 

00:14:29.180 --> 00:14:31.269
the reason i italicized word is because
what you'll see is that we kind of

00:14:31.269 --> 00:14:31.279
what you'll see is that we kind of
 

00:14:31.279 --> 00:14:33.790
what you'll see is that we kind of
started out with word embeddings but now

00:14:33.790 --> 00:14:33.800
started out with word embeddings but now
 

00:14:33.800 --> 00:14:36.519
started out with word embeddings but now
it's you know phrase embeddings document

00:14:36.519 --> 00:14:36.529
it's you know phrase embeddings document
 

00:14:36.529 --> 00:14:38.220
it's you know phrase embeddings document
embedding so there's much more to this

00:14:38.220 --> 00:14:38.230
embedding so there's much more to this
 

00:14:38.230 --> 00:14:40.749
embedding so there's much more to this
but let's let's start first with what do

00:14:40.749 --> 00:14:40.759
but let's let's start first with what do
 

00:14:40.759 --> 00:14:43.629
but let's let's start first with what do
we mean with word embeddings okay the

00:14:43.629 --> 00:14:43.639
we mean with word embeddings okay the
 

00:14:43.639 --> 00:14:47.889
we mean with word embeddings okay the
point is to try to represent a word as a

00:14:47.889 --> 00:14:47.899
point is to try to represent a word as a
 

00:14:47.899 --> 00:14:50.889
point is to try to represent a word as a
real valued vector that basically

00:14:50.889 --> 00:14:50.899
real valued vector that basically
 

00:14:50.899 --> 00:14:54.009
real valued vector that basically
represents what that words means in

00:14:54.009 --> 00:14:54.019
represents what that words means in
 

00:14:54.019 --> 00:14:56.620
represents what that words means in
terms of other words right so so the the

00:14:56.620 --> 00:14:56.630
terms of other words right so so the the
 

00:14:56.630 --> 00:14:59.410
terms of other words right so so the the
dimensions of that vector the features

00:14:59.410 --> 00:14:59.420
dimensions of that vector the features
 

00:14:59.420 --> 00:15:02.920
dimensions of that vector the features
are basically other words and the point

00:15:02.920 --> 00:15:02.930
are basically other words and the point
 

00:15:02.930 --> 00:15:04.780
are basically other words and the point
is that you can assign different weights

00:15:04.780 --> 00:15:04.790
is that you can assign different weights
 

00:15:04.790 --> 00:15:07.990
is that you can assign different weights
on how well that word relates to these

00:15:07.990 --> 00:15:08.000
on how well that word relates to these
 

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:11.259
on how well that word relates to these
other words okay so now the difficult

00:15:11.259 --> 00:15:11.269
other words okay so now the difficult
 

00:15:11.269 --> 00:15:14.340
other words okay so now the difficult
part there is how do you learn that

00:15:14.340 --> 00:15:14.350
part there is how do you learn that
 

00:15:14.350 --> 00:15:16.840
part there is how do you learn that
representation that's going to give you

00:15:16.840 --> 00:15:16.850
representation that's going to give you
 

00:15:16.850 --> 00:15:20.139
representation that's going to give you
that objective of making that vector

00:15:20.139 --> 00:15:20.149
that objective of making that vector
 

00:15:20.149 --> 00:15:22.590
that objective of making that vector
really represent that word and be

00:15:22.590 --> 00:15:22.600
really represent that word and be
 

00:15:22.600 --> 00:15:24.970
really represent that word and be
comparable to other words in a way that

00:15:24.970 --> 00:15:24.980
comparable to other words in a way that
 

00:15:24.980 --> 00:15:28.030
comparable to other words in a way that
the machine can can compute on them so

00:15:28.030 --> 00:15:28.040
the machine can can compute on them so
 

00:15:28.040 --> 00:15:30.759
the machine can can compute on them so
the idea is the first work earlier work

00:15:30.759 --> 00:15:30.769
the idea is the first work earlier work
 

00:15:30.769 --> 00:15:31.490
the idea is the first work earlier work
in this was

00:15:31.490 --> 00:15:31.500
in this was
 

00:15:31.500 --> 00:15:34.450
in this was
all right how do we do this such that

00:15:34.450 --> 00:15:34.460
all right how do we do this such that
 

00:15:34.460 --> 00:15:38.840
all right how do we do this such that
those embeddings those vectors give you

00:15:38.840 --> 00:15:38.850
those embeddings those vectors give you
 

00:15:38.850 --> 00:15:41.030
those embeddings those vectors give you
an understanding of the similarity

00:15:41.030 --> 00:15:41.040
an understanding of the similarity
 

00:15:41.040 --> 00:15:43.700
an understanding of the similarity
between this word and other words within

00:15:43.700 --> 00:15:43.710
between this word and other words within
 

00:15:43.710 --> 00:15:46.910
between this word and other words within
your dictionary first model here was

00:15:46.910 --> 00:15:46.920
your dictionary first model here was
 

00:15:46.920 --> 00:15:49.480
your dictionary first model here was
what they refer to as a skip gram model

00:15:49.480 --> 00:15:49.490
what they refer to as a skip gram model
 

00:15:49.490 --> 00:15:51.530
what they refer to as a skip gram model
basically what you try to do is you say

00:15:51.530 --> 00:15:51.540
basically what you try to do is you say
 

00:15:51.540 --> 00:15:55.730
basically what you try to do is you say
give it a particular word how well can I

00:15:55.730 --> 00:15:55.740
give it a particular word how well can I
 

00:15:55.740 --> 00:15:57.650
give it a particular word how well can I
predict the words around it the words

00:15:57.650 --> 00:15:57.660
predict the words around it the words
 

00:15:57.660 --> 00:15:59.540
predict the words around it the words
that are one hop away from it two hop

00:15:59.540 --> 00:15:59.550
that are one hop away from it two hop
 

00:15:59.550 --> 00:16:01.480
that are one hop away from it two hop
away from it three hops away from it

00:16:01.480 --> 00:16:01.490
away from it three hops away from it
 

00:16:01.490 --> 00:16:04.340
away from it three hops away from it
what they're trying to do is to train a

00:16:04.340 --> 00:16:04.350
what they're trying to do is to train a
 

00:16:04.350 --> 00:16:08.210
what they're trying to do is to train a
set of vectors where you minimize the

00:16:08.210 --> 00:16:08.220
set of vectors where you minimize the
 

00:16:08.220 --> 00:16:12.440
set of vectors where you minimize the
the the loss the prediction loss of

00:16:12.440 --> 00:16:12.450
the the loss the prediction loss of
 

00:16:12.450 --> 00:16:14.510
the the loss the prediction loss of
being able to predict the words around

00:16:14.510 --> 00:16:14.520
being able to predict the words around
 

00:16:14.520 --> 00:16:17.360
being able to predict the words around
it based off of that word there's a very

00:16:17.360 --> 00:16:17.370
it based off of that word there's a very
 

00:16:17.370 --> 00:16:18.410
it based off of that word there's a very
big difference for the community

00:16:18.410 --> 00:16:18.420
big difference for the community
 

00:16:18.420 --> 00:16:20.960
big difference for the community
previously it had been mostly counts

00:16:20.960 --> 00:16:20.970
previously it had been mostly counts
 

00:16:20.970 --> 00:16:22.280
previously it had been mostly counts
people just kind of count the number of

00:16:22.280 --> 00:16:22.290
people just kind of count the number of
 

00:16:22.290 --> 00:16:24.470
people just kind of count the number of
occurrences and then they would use that

00:16:24.470 --> 00:16:24.480
occurrences and then they would use that
 

00:16:24.480 --> 00:16:27.920
occurrences and then they would use that
to try to almost make that two wait what

00:16:27.920 --> 00:16:27.930
to try to almost make that two wait what
 

00:16:27.930 --> 00:16:30.170
to try to almost make that two wait what
this was doing was taking a deep neural

00:16:30.170 --> 00:16:30.180
this was doing was taking a deep neural
 

00:16:30.180 --> 00:16:32.090
this was doing was taking a deep neural
network well it was actually kind of a

00:16:32.090 --> 00:16:32.100
network well it was actually kind of a
 

00:16:32.100 --> 00:16:34.870
network well it was actually kind of a
shallow neural network to try to

00:16:34.870 --> 00:16:34.880
shallow neural network to try to
 

00:16:34.880 --> 00:16:39.500
shallow neural network to try to
optimize or maximize this log

00:16:39.500 --> 00:16:39.510
optimize or maximize this log
 

00:16:39.510 --> 00:16:41.480
optimize or maximize this log
probability of being able to predict the

00:16:41.480 --> 00:16:41.490
probability of being able to predict the
 

00:16:41.490 --> 00:16:43.430
probability of being able to predict the
words around it from that and what they

00:16:43.430 --> 00:16:43.440
words around it from that and what they
 

00:16:43.440 --> 00:16:45.350
words around it from that and what they
got from that is what you can kind of

00:16:45.350 --> 00:16:45.360
got from that is what you can kind of
 

00:16:45.360 --> 00:16:49.160
got from that is what you can kind of
see here this ability to place words

00:16:49.160 --> 00:16:49.170
see here this ability to place words
 

00:16:49.170 --> 00:16:52.790
see here this ability to place words
symbols into a vector space such that

00:16:52.790 --> 00:16:52.800
symbols into a vector space such that
 

00:16:52.800 --> 00:16:55.850
symbols into a vector space such that
words that are similar or closer

00:16:55.850 --> 00:16:55.860
words that are similar or closer
 

00:16:55.860 --> 00:16:56.420
words that are similar or closer
together

00:16:56.420 --> 00:16:56.430
together
 

00:16:56.430 --> 00:16:58.880
together
right so the point is you can see and

00:16:58.880 --> 00:16:58.890
right so the point is you can see and
 

00:16:58.890 --> 00:17:01.670
right so the point is you can see and
and also that relationships between

00:17:01.670 --> 00:17:01.680
and also that relationships between
 

00:17:01.680 --> 00:17:03.920
and also that relationships between
words you know move in similar

00:17:03.920 --> 00:17:03.930
words you know move in similar
 

00:17:03.930 --> 00:17:05.870
words you know move in similar
directions right so what this figure is

00:17:05.870 --> 00:17:05.880
directions right so what this figure is
 

00:17:05.880 --> 00:17:07.429
directions right so what this figure is
trying to show you is that you know you

00:17:07.429 --> 00:17:07.439
trying to show you is that you know you
 

00:17:07.439 --> 00:17:09.410
trying to show you is that you know you
can look at the countries that are here

00:17:09.410 --> 00:17:09.420
can look at the countries that are here
 

00:17:09.420 --> 00:17:12.020
can look at the countries that are here
on the on the left side and you can see

00:17:12.020 --> 00:17:12.030
on the on the left side and you can see
 

00:17:12.030 --> 00:17:15.290
on the on the left side and you can see
that they're similar the ones that are

00:17:15.290 --> 00:17:15.300
that they're similar the ones that are
 

00:17:15.300 --> 00:17:19.100
that they're similar the ones that are
all countries are proximal the cities

00:17:19.100 --> 00:17:19.110
all countries are proximal the cities
 

00:17:19.110 --> 00:17:22.699
all countries are proximal the cities
are proximal the you know the the vector

00:17:22.699 --> 00:17:22.709
are proximal the you know the the vector
 

00:17:22.709 --> 00:17:26.230
are proximal the you know the the vector
that is going from countries to city are

00:17:26.230 --> 00:17:26.240
that is going from countries to city are
 

00:17:26.240 --> 00:17:28.700
that is going from countries to city are
you know essentially going in the same

00:17:28.700 --> 00:17:28.710
you know essentially going in the same
 

00:17:28.710 --> 00:17:29.930
you know essentially going in the same
direction I'm sure I'm not sure if you

00:17:29.930 --> 00:17:29.940
direction I'm sure I'm not sure if you
 

00:17:29.940 --> 00:17:32.120
direction I'm sure I'm not sure if you
can actually see that but the point is

00:17:32.120 --> 00:17:32.130
can actually see that but the point is
 

00:17:32.130 --> 00:17:34.550
can actually see that but the point is
that this kind of a vector space gives

00:17:34.550 --> 00:17:34.560
that this kind of a vector space gives
 

00:17:34.560 --> 00:17:37.640
that this kind of a vector space gives
us the ability to compute on those real

00:17:37.640 --> 00:17:37.650
us the ability to compute on those real
 

00:17:37.650 --> 00:17:40.550
us the ability to compute on those real
valued vectors and then learn more about

00:17:40.550 --> 00:17:40.560
valued vectors and then learn more about
 

00:17:40.560 --> 00:17:43.400
valued vectors and then learn more about
this so a very first simple thing is to

00:17:43.400 --> 00:17:43.410
this so a very first simple thing is to
 

00:17:43.410 --> 00:17:44.580
this so a very first simple thing is to
be able to you know

00:17:44.580 --> 00:17:44.590
be able to you know
 

00:17:44.590 --> 00:17:47.100
be able to you know
be able to find other similar things

00:17:47.100 --> 00:17:47.110
be able to find other similar things
 

00:17:47.110 --> 00:17:48.990
be able to find other similar things
right you have you have something you

00:17:48.990 --> 00:17:49.000
right you have you have something you
 

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:51.450
right you have you have something you
have a symbol Italy for example can you

00:17:51.450 --> 00:17:51.460
have a symbol Italy for example can you
 

00:17:51.460 --> 00:17:53.640
have a symbol Italy for example can you
find other things that are similar to or

00:17:53.640 --> 00:17:53.650
find other things that are similar to or
 

00:17:53.650 --> 00:17:55.500
find other things that are similar to or
related to Italy you can find other

00:17:55.500 --> 00:17:55.510
related to Italy you can find other
 

00:17:55.510 --> 00:17:57.090
related to Italy you can find other
countries you can find cities within

00:17:57.090 --> 00:17:57.100
countries you can find cities within
 

00:17:57.100 --> 00:17:59.610
countries you can find cities within
Italy that's the that's kind of the

00:17:59.610 --> 00:17:59.620
Italy that's the that's kind of the
 

00:17:59.620 --> 00:18:03.180
Italy that's the that's kind of the
first step the you know so the first the

00:18:03.180 --> 00:18:03.190
first step the you know so the first the
 

00:18:03.190 --> 00:18:05.850
first step the you know so the first the
first work there was this kind of

00:18:05.850 --> 00:18:05.860
first work there was this kind of
 

00:18:05.860 --> 00:18:08.130
first work there was this kind of
distributed representation that we're

00:18:08.130 --> 00:18:08.140
distributed representation that we're
 

00:18:08.140 --> 00:18:10.980
distributed representation that we're
talking about here the second is

00:18:10.980 --> 00:18:10.990
talking about here the second is
 

00:18:10.990 --> 00:18:12.720
talking about here the second is
basically showing the difference in

00:18:12.720 --> 00:18:12.730
basically showing the difference in
 

00:18:12.730 --> 00:18:14.940
basically showing the difference in
terms of being able to second talk as a

00:18:14.940 --> 00:18:14.950
terms of being able to second talk as a
 

00:18:14.950 --> 00:18:18.889
terms of being able to second talk as a
paper was about the accuracy the

00:18:18.889 --> 00:18:18.899
paper was about the accuracy the
 

00:18:18.899 --> 00:18:21.269
paper was about the accuracy the
significant jump in accuracy that we got

00:18:21.269 --> 00:18:21.279
significant jump in accuracy that we got
 

00:18:21.279 --> 00:18:23.460
significant jump in accuracy that we got
from being able to do that prediction

00:18:23.460 --> 00:18:23.470
from being able to do that prediction
 

00:18:23.470 --> 00:18:26.070
from being able to do that prediction

create your own embeddings so first

00:18:45.899 --> 00:18:45.909
create your own embeddings so first
 

00:18:45.909 --> 00:18:48.120
create your own embeddings so first
thing was you know how do they create it

00:18:48.120 --> 00:18:48.130
thing was you know how do they create it
 

00:18:48.130 --> 00:18:49.919
thing was you know how do they create it
and they went after a specific thing how

00:18:49.919 --> 00:18:49.929
and they went after a specific thing how
 

00:18:49.929 --> 00:18:52.200
and they went after a specific thing how
do you optimize that similarity but what

00:18:52.200 --> 00:18:52.210
do you optimize that similarity but what
 

00:18:52.210 --> 00:18:53.610
do you optimize that similarity but what
you'll see from the rest of the talk is

00:18:53.610 --> 00:18:53.620
you'll see from the rest of the talk is
 

00:18:53.620 --> 00:18:55.500
you'll see from the rest of the talk is
that there are many other ways that you

00:18:55.500 --> 00:18:55.510
that there are many other ways that you
 

00:18:55.510 --> 00:18:57.210
that there are many other ways that you
might want to try to figure out how to

00:18:57.210 --> 00:18:57.220
might want to try to figure out how to
 

00:18:57.220 --> 00:18:59.940
might want to try to figure out how to
place things together other constraints

00:18:59.940 --> 00:18:59.950
place things together other constraints
 

00:18:59.950 --> 00:19:01.680
place things together other constraints
that you might want to place on the

00:19:01.680 --> 00:19:01.690
that you might want to place on the
 

00:19:01.690 --> 00:19:03.480
that you might want to place on the
vector space and how things are

00:19:03.480 --> 00:19:03.490
vector space and how things are
 

00:19:03.490 --> 00:19:05.549
vector space and how things are
represented in that vector space so that

00:19:05.549 --> 00:19:05.559
represented in that vector space so that
 

00:19:05.559 --> 00:19:10.919
represented in that vector space so that
you can accomplish tasks from it prior

00:19:10.919 --> 00:19:10.929
you can accomplish tasks from it prior
 

00:19:10.929 --> 00:19:13.860
you can accomplish tasks from it prior
to these types of representation the

00:19:13.860 --> 00:19:13.870
to these types of representation the
 

00:19:13.870 --> 00:19:16.230
to these types of representation the
ideals for how people would actually go

00:19:16.230 --> 00:19:16.240
ideals for how people would actually go
 

00:19:16.240 --> 00:19:18.720
ideals for how people would actually go
after representing knowledge and

00:19:18.720 --> 00:19:18.730
after representing knowledge and
 

00:19:18.730 --> 00:19:22.169
after representing knowledge and

00:19:22.169 --> 00:19:22.179
language were knowledge bases structured
 

00:19:22.179 --> 00:19:24.480
language were knowledge bases structured
knowledge so our original ideas was

00:19:24.480 --> 00:19:24.490
knowledge so our original ideas was
 

00:19:24.490 --> 00:19:27.590

alright listen I have to be able to have

00:19:27.590 --> 00:19:27.600
alright listen I have to be able to have
 

00:19:27.600 --> 00:19:29.970
alright listen I have to be able to have
entities that are well defined I have to

have well-defined relationships between
 

00:19:31.690 --> 00:19:34.860
have well-defined relationships between
those entities I have to have rules that

those entities I have to have rules that
 

00:19:34.870 --> 00:19:36.810
those entities I have to have rules that
basically will give me information about

00:19:36.810 --> 00:19:36.820
basically will give me information about
 

00:19:36.820 --> 00:19:39.690
basically will give me information about
you know categories of relationships or

automatically populate knowledge bases
that look like the form that we

00:20:58.450 --> 00:20:58.460
that look like the form that we
 

00:20:58.460 --> 00:21:01.270
that look like the form that we
understand and feel that we can apply

in terms of going from that symbolic
knowledge into sub symbolic knowledge so

knowledge into sub symbolic knowledge so
 

00:21:12.770 --> 00:21:14.110
knowledge into sub symbolic knowledge so
the vectors that I was talking about

00:21:14.110 --> 00:21:14.120
the vectors that I was talking about
 

00:21:14.120 --> 00:21:17.200
the vectors that I was talking about
earlier was could we redo our knowledge

00:21:17.200 --> 00:21:17.210
earlier was could we redo our knowledge
 

00:21:17.210 --> 00:21:19.900

these these vectors if we were able to
 

00:21:22.280 --> 00:21:25.270
these these vectors if we were able to
do that then we actually would be able

00:21:25.270 --> 00:21:25.280
do that then we actually would be able
 

00:21:25.280 --> 00:21:27.640
do that then we actually would be able
to learn much more data it's possible we

00:21:27.640 --> 00:21:27.650
to learn much more data it's possible we
 

00:21:27.650 --> 00:21:29.140
to learn much more data it's possible we
could learn these these representations

00:21:29.140 --> 00:21:29.150
could learn these these representations
 

00:21:29.150 --> 00:21:32.230
could learn these these representations
and fill out some of the the information

00:21:32.230 --> 00:21:32.240
and fill out some of the the information
 

00:21:32.240 --> 00:21:33.700
and fill out some of the the information
that we're missing from our knowledge

relationship between these and I can

00:21:55.060 --> 00:21:55.070
relationship between these and I can
 

00:21:55.070 --> 00:21:56.860
relationship between these and I can
start to populate more of the

00:21:56.860 --> 00:21:56.870
start to populate more of the
 

00:21:56.870 --> 00:21:58.570
start to populate more of the
relationships that I'm that I'm missing

00:21:58.570 --> 00:21:58.580
relationships that I'm that I'm missing
 

00:21:58.580 --> 00:22:02.530
relationships that I'm that I'm missing
from my knowledge base

00:22:02.530 --> 00:22:02.540
 
 

00:22:02.540 --> 00:22:05.240
 
we're able to use this this this

00:22:05.240 --> 00:22:05.250
we're able to use this this this
 

00:22:05.250 --> 00:22:08.600
we're able to use this this this
principle of the the embeddings and the

00:22:08.600 --> 00:22:08.610
principle of the the embeddings and the
 

00:22:08.610 --> 00:22:11.450
principle of the the embeddings and the
knowledgebase is to then start to grow

00:22:11.450 --> 00:22:11.460
knowledgebase is to then start to grow
 

00:22:11.460 --> 00:22:13.520
knowledgebase is to then start to grow
the knowledge bases that we have right

00:22:13.520 --> 00:22:13.530
the knowledge bases that we have right
 

00:22:13.530 --> 00:22:16.580
the knowledge bases that we have right
so this is basic the first study here is

00:22:16.580 --> 00:22:16.590
so this is basic the first study here is
 

00:22:16.590 --> 00:22:19.070
so this is basic the first study here is
showing how we took information about

00:22:19.070 --> 00:22:19.080
showing how we took information about
 

00:22:19.080 --> 00:22:24.290
showing how we took information about
genes diseases and drugs from ontologies

that were available represented that
learn vectors across that structured

00:22:30.230 --> 00:22:30.240
learn vectors across that structured
 

00:22:30.240 --> 00:22:33.070
learn vectors across that structured
space so that we could predict

00:22:33.070 --> 00:22:33.080
space so that we could predict
 

00:22:33.080 --> 00:22:34.880

relationships that weren't in the
 

00:22:34.890 --> 00:22:36.650
relationships that weren't in the
knowledge base that's important because

00:22:36.650 --> 00:22:36.660
knowledge base that's important because
 

00:22:36.660 --> 00:22:38.780
knowledge base that's important because
if you think about how people get that

00:22:38.780 --> 00:22:38.790
if you think about how people get that
 

00:22:38.790 --> 00:22:41.450
if you think about how people get that
information today they actually do wet

00:22:41.450 --> 00:22:41.460

there is a relationship if something up
 

00:22:45.750 --> 00:22:47.600
there is a relationship if something up
regulates something else it's very

00:22:47.600 --> 00:22:47.610
regulates something else it's very
 

00:22:47.610 --> 00:22:50.960
regulates something else it's very
expensive if we can use this knowledge

00:22:50.960 --> 00:22:50.970
expensive if we can use this knowledge
 

00:22:50.970 --> 00:22:53.600
expensive if we can use this knowledge
to make those predictions then we can

00:22:53.600 --> 00:22:53.610
to make those predictions then we can
 

00:22:53.610 --> 00:22:56.270
to make those predictions then we can
give other scientists places to look

00:22:56.270 --> 00:22:56.280
give other scientists places to look
 

00:22:56.280 --> 00:22:58.940
give other scientists places to look
looks like there might be an interaction

00:22:58.940 --> 00:22:58.950
looks like there might be an interaction
 

00:22:58.950 --> 00:23:01.820
looks like there might be an interaction
here maybe you could try that right the

00:23:01.820 --> 00:23:01.830
here maybe you could try that right the
 

00:23:01.830 --> 00:23:04.600

basically there was a challenge issued

00:23:07.730 --> 00:23:07.740
basically there was a challenge issued
 

00:23:07.740 --> 00:23:10.340
basically there was a challenge issued
by the Semantic Web community how can we

00:23:10.340 --> 00:23:10.350
by the Semantic Web community how can we
 

00:23:10.350 --> 00:23:12.440
by the Semantic Web community how can we
better improve this automated knowledge

00:23:12.440 --> 00:23:12.450
better improve this automated knowledge
 

00:23:12.450 --> 00:23:14.930
better improve this automated knowledge
based construction so the team used a

00:23:14.930 --> 00:23:14.940
based construction so the team used a
 

00:23:14.940 --> 00:23:17.960
based construction so the team used a
combination of these word embeddings to

00:23:17.960 --> 00:23:17.970
combination of these word embeddings to
 

00:23:17.970 --> 00:23:20.810
combination of these word embeddings to
be able to search for and validate

information gained from a set of
 

00:23:22.710 --> 00:23:24.650
information gained from a set of
structured and unstructured knowledge so

00:23:24.650 --> 00:23:24.660
structured and unstructured knowledge so
 

00:23:24.660 --> 00:23:26.870
structured and unstructured knowledge so
this is actually one first place in the

00:23:26.870 --> 00:23:26.880
this is actually one first place in the
 

00:23:26.880 --> 00:23:31.760
this is actually one first place in the
in the 2017 semantic web challenge okay

00:23:31.760 --> 00:23:31.770
in the 2017 semantic web challenge okay
 

00:23:31.770 --> 00:23:33.680
in the 2017 semantic web challenge okay
so now we were kind of getting an idea

00:23:33.680 --> 00:23:33.690
so now we were kind of getting an idea
 

00:23:33.690 --> 00:23:39.320
so now we were kind of getting an idea
about how we would take language make it

00:23:39.320 --> 00:23:39.330
about how we would take language make it
 

00:23:39.330 --> 00:23:41.750
about how we would take language make it
computational put it into a knowledge

00:23:41.750 --> 00:23:41.760
computational put it into a knowledge
 

00:23:41.760 --> 00:23:43.370
computational put it into a knowledge

base so that we can aggregate it over
 

00:23:43.380 --> 00:23:46.070
base so that we can aggregate it over
time but how are we going to get the

00:23:46.070 --> 00:23:46.080
time but how are we going to get the
 

00:23:46.080 --> 00:23:48.860
time but how are we going to get the
neural networks to use that that's the

00:23:48.860 --> 00:23:48.870
neural networks to use that that's the
 

00:23:48.870 --> 00:23:53.150
neural networks to use that that's the
next question okay an example task of

00:23:53.150 --> 00:23:53.160
next question okay an example task of
 

00:23:53.160 --> 00:23:54.950
next question okay an example task of
why you would want those neural networks

00:23:54.950 --> 00:23:54.960
why you would want those neural networks
 

00:23:54.960 --> 00:23:57.050
why you would want those neural networks
to be able to use that is question

00:23:57.050 --> 00:23:57.060
to be able to use that is question
 

00:23:57.060 --> 00:23:59.960
to be able to use that is question
answering you want to build up a

00:23:59.960 --> 00:23:59.970
answering you want to build up a
 

00:23:59.970 --> 00:24:02.270
answering you want to build up a
knowledge base everything you can

00:24:02.270 --> 00:24:02.280
knowledge base everything you can
 

00:24:02.280 --> 00:24:04.370
knowledge base everything you can
possibly find and then you want to be

00:24:04.370 --> 00:24:04.380
possibly find and then you want to be
 

00:24:04.380 --> 00:24:07.070
possibly find and then you want to be
able to ask your questions and see if it

00:24:07.070 --> 00:24:07.080
able to ask your questions and see if it
 

00:24:07.080 --> 00:24:10.100
able to ask your questions and see if it
can answer those questions we say that

00:24:10.100 --> 00:24:10.110
can answer those questions we say that
 

00:24:10.110 --> 00:24:12.230
can answer those questions we say that
this requires memories because the point

00:24:12.230 --> 00:24:12.240
this requires memories because the point
 

00:24:12.240 --> 00:24:13.430
this requires memories because the point
is that if you think about some of the

00:24:13.430 --> 00:24:13.440
is that if you think about some of the
 

00:24:13.440 --> 00:24:15.299
is that if you think about some of the
other tasks that you may have seen

00:24:15.299 --> 00:24:15.309
other tasks that you may have seen
 

00:24:15.309 --> 00:24:17.220
other tasks that you may have seen
you provide once you've trained the

00:24:17.220 --> 00:24:17.230
you provide once you've trained the
 

00:24:17.230 --> 00:24:20.039
you provide once you've trained the
network you provide an input and then

00:24:20.039 --> 00:24:20.049
network you provide an input and then
 

00:24:20.049 --> 00:24:22.379
network you provide an input and then
you get an output you don't necessarily

00:24:22.379 --> 00:24:22.389
you get an output you don't necessarily
 

00:24:22.389 --> 00:24:26.909
you get an output you don't necessarily
use long term memories of relationships

00:24:26.909 --> 00:24:26.919
use long term memories of relationships
 

00:24:26.919 --> 00:24:28.680
use long term memories of relationships
and entities and all of these sorts of

00:24:28.680 --> 00:24:28.690
and entities and all of these sorts of
 

00:24:28.690 --> 00:24:32.909
and entities and all of these sorts of
things okay so this is a challenge that

00:24:32.909 --> 00:24:32.919
things okay so this is a challenge that
 

00:24:32.919 --> 00:24:35.249
things okay so this is a challenge that
was issued to the community essentially

00:24:35.249 --> 00:24:35.259
was issued to the community essentially
 

00:24:35.259 --> 00:24:37.320
was issued to the community essentially
in terms of being able to read some

00:24:37.320 --> 00:24:37.330
in terms of being able to read some
 

00:24:37.330 --> 00:24:40.619
in terms of being able to read some
sentences and then being able to given a

00:24:40.619 --> 00:24:40.629
sentences and then being able to given a
 

00:24:40.629 --> 00:24:42.749
sentences and then being able to given a
question give an answer to that and

00:24:42.749 --> 00:24:42.759
question give an answer to that and
 

00:24:42.759 --> 00:24:44.850
question give an answer to that and
there are different stages of the

00:24:44.850 --> 00:24:44.860
there are different stages of the
 

00:24:44.860 --> 00:24:47.850
there are different stages of the
complexity of what is required in order

00:24:47.850 --> 00:24:47.860
complexity of what is required in order
 

00:24:47.860 --> 00:24:49.259
complexity of what is required in order
to answer the question sometimes it's

00:24:49.259 --> 00:24:49.269
to answer the question sometimes it's
 

00:24:49.269 --> 00:24:50.850
to answer the question sometimes it's
really just kind of finding the sentence

00:24:50.850 --> 00:24:50.860
really just kind of finding the sentence
 

00:24:50.860 --> 00:24:53.399
really just kind of finding the sentence
sometimes it's being able to put

00:24:53.399 --> 00:24:53.409
sometimes it's being able to put
 

00:24:53.409 --> 00:24:55.109
sometimes it's being able to put
multiple sentences together sometimes

00:24:55.109 --> 00:24:55.119
multiple sentences together sometimes
 

00:24:55.119 --> 00:24:57.930
multiple sentences together sometimes
it's being able to chain across time and

00:24:57.930 --> 00:24:57.940
it's being able to chain across time and
 

00:24:57.940 --> 00:25:00.029
it's being able to chain across time and
so there are many there's stages of

00:25:00.029 --> 00:25:00.039
so there are many there's stages of
 

00:25:00.039 --> 00:25:02.399
so there are many there's stages of
difficulties in order to do that but

00:25:02.399 --> 00:25:02.409
difficulties in order to do that but
 

00:25:02.409 --> 00:25:05.970
difficulties in order to do that but
what I want to focus on is some of the

00:25:05.970 --> 00:25:05.980
what I want to focus on is some of the
 

00:25:05.980 --> 00:25:07.919
what I want to focus on is some of the
early work in terms of creating a neural

00:25:07.919 --> 00:25:07.929
early work in terms of creating a neural
 

00:25:07.929 --> 00:25:11.909
early work in terms of creating a neural
network that can then access those

00:25:11.909 --> 00:25:11.919
network that can then access those
 

00:25:11.919 --> 00:25:14.129
network that can then access those
knowledge bases and then be able to

00:25:14.129 --> 00:25:14.139
knowledge bases and then be able to
 

00:25:14.139 --> 00:25:17.100
knowledge bases and then be able to
produce an answer from that right so the

00:25:17.100 --> 00:25:17.110
produce an answer from that right so the
 

00:25:17.110 --> 00:25:19.379
produce an answer from that right so the
expectation is that you you build up

00:25:19.379 --> 00:25:19.389
expectation is that you you build up
 

00:25:19.389 --> 00:25:21.239
expectation is that you you build up
those knowledge bases from as much

00:25:21.239 --> 00:25:21.249
those knowledge bases from as much
 

00:25:21.249 --> 00:25:24.060
those knowledge bases from as much
information you can find previously you

00:25:24.060 --> 00:25:24.070
information you can find previously you
 

00:25:24.070 --> 00:25:26.070
information you can find previously you
train them such that they know how to

00:25:26.070 --> 00:25:26.080
train them such that they know how to
 

00:25:26.080 --> 00:25:28.769
train them such that they know how to
answer a question the types of questions

00:25:28.769 --> 00:25:28.779
answer a question the types of questions
 

00:25:28.779 --> 00:25:31.350
answer a question the types of questions
that you'd like them to answer and then

00:25:31.350 --> 00:25:31.360
that you'd like them to answer and then
 

00:25:31.360 --> 00:25:33.119
that you'd like them to answer and then
from that when you you handed a question

00:25:33.119 --> 00:25:33.129
from that when you you handed a question

it's able to produce an answer the
 

00:25:35.529 --> 00:25:38.100
it's able to produce an answer the
reason this is different from what

people are doing today it's not just
 

00:25:40.629 --> 00:25:43.859
people are doing today it's not just
about saying today what happens is you

00:25:43.859 --> 00:25:43.869
about saying today what happens is you
 

00:25:43.869 --> 00:25:45.899
about saying today what happens is you
know when you program a computer then

00:25:45.899 --> 00:25:45.909
know when you program a computer then
 

00:25:45.909 --> 00:25:48.029
know when you program a computer then
you tell it okay I want to be able to

00:25:48.029 --> 00:25:48.039
you tell it okay I want to be able to
 

00:25:48.039 --> 00:25:49.619
you tell it okay I want to be able to
access this place in memory you know I

00:25:49.619 --> 00:25:49.629
access this place in memory you know I
 

00:25:49.629 --> 00:25:52.529
access this place in memory you know I
do a query on a database and I say okay

00:25:52.529 --> 00:25:52.539
do a query on a database and I say okay
 

00:25:52.539 --> 00:25:53.820
do a query on a database and I say okay
I'd like for you to give me all the rows

00:25:53.820 --> 00:25:53.830
I'd like for you to give me all the rows
 

00:25:53.830 --> 00:25:56.580
I'd like for you to give me all the rows
where the first name is is excellent the

00:25:56.580 --> 00:25:56.590
where the first name is is excellent the
 

00:25:56.590 --> 00:25:58.499
where the first name is is excellent the
last name is why it can come back and

00:25:58.499 --> 00:25:58.509
last name is why it can come back and

that's all programmed these networks are

00:26:01.549 --> 00:26:01.559
that's all programmed these networks are
 

00:26:01.559 --> 00:26:07.019
that's all programmed these networks are
instead learning how to access memory by

00:26:07.019 --> 00:26:07.029
instead learning how to access memory by
 

00:26:07.029 --> 00:26:09.090
instead learning how to access memory by
looking at other patterns of access to

00:26:09.090 --> 00:26:09.100
looking at other patterns of access to
 

00:26:09.100 --> 00:26:12.749
looking at other patterns of access to
memory not program train it train so the

00:26:12.749 --> 00:26:12.759
memory not program train it train so the
 

00:26:12.759 --> 00:26:14.789
memory not program train it train so the
point here is the neural net is the

00:26:14.789 --> 00:26:14.799
point here is the neural net is the
 

00:26:14.799 --> 00:26:16.499
point here is the neural net is the
controller of how that memory is

00:26:16.499 --> 00:26:16.509
controller of how that memory is
 

00:26:16.509 --> 00:26:19.440
controller of how that memory is
accessed in order to produce an answer

00:26:19.440 --> 00:26:19.450
accessed in order to produce an answer
 

00:26:19.450 --> 00:26:21.060
accessed in order to produce an answer
okay

00:26:21.060 --> 00:26:21.070
okay
 

00:26:21.070 --> 00:26:23.249
okay
so what happens is that they they it is

00:26:23.249 --> 00:26:23.259
so what happens is that they they it is
 

00:26:23.259 --> 00:26:25.200
so what happens is that they they it is
a supervised result so they they do

00:26:25.200 --> 00:26:25.210
a supervised result so they they do
 

00:26:25.210 --> 00:26:27.480
a supervised result so they they do
train jointly with okay what are the

00:26:27.480 --> 00:26:27.490
train jointly with okay what are the
 

00:26:27.490 --> 00:26:28.350
train jointly with okay what are the

desired from that and then by providing
 

00:26:35.590 --> 00:26:38.009
desired from that and then by providing
many many many examples of that then

00:26:38.009 --> 00:26:38.019
many many many examples of that then
 

00:26:38.019 --> 00:26:39.830
many many many examples of that then
when you provided a new set of

00:26:39.830 --> 00:26:39.840
when you provided a new set of
 

00:26:39.840 --> 00:26:42.570
when you provided a new set of
information then it's able to to answer

00:26:42.570 --> 00:26:42.580
information then it's able to to answer
 

00:26:42.580 --> 00:26:46.139
information then it's able to to answer
a question from that by basically taking

00:26:46.139 --> 00:26:46.149
a question from that by basically taking
 

00:26:46.149 --> 00:26:48.870
a question from that by basically taking
a vector representation of the question

00:26:48.870 --> 00:26:48.880
a vector representation of the question
 

00:26:48.880 --> 00:26:51.750
a vector representation of the question
cue being able to map that on to the

cue being able to map that on to the
 

00:26:51.760 --> 00:26:53.759
cue being able to map that on to the
memory so the embeddings that were

00:26:53.759 --> 00:26:53.769
memory so the embeddings that were
 

00:26:53.769 --> 00:26:55.169
memory so the embeddings that were
produced from all the sentences that

00:26:55.169 --> 00:26:55.179
produced from all the sentences that
 

00:26:55.179 --> 00:26:57.899
produced from all the sentences that
were entered and then moving back and

00:26:57.899 --> 00:26:57.909
were entered and then moving back and
 

00:26:57.909 --> 00:27:00.060
were entered and then moving back and
forth across that until it gets to a

forth across that until it gets to a
 

00:27:00.070 --> 00:27:03.299
forth across that until it gets to a
confidence that in an answer and

00:27:03.299 --> 00:27:03.309
confidence that in an answer and
 

00:27:03.309 --> 00:27:06.690
confidence that in an answer and
transferring that into into an output on

to try to start to answer these
 

00:27:30.760 --> 00:27:33.690
to try to start to answer these
questions while it's it's incredibly

00:27:33.690 --> 00:27:33.700
questions while it's it's incredibly
 

00:27:33.700 --> 00:27:36.600
questions while it's it's incredibly
exciting you know there's still many of

00:27:36.600 --> 00:27:36.610
exciting you know there's still many of
 

00:27:36.610 --> 00:27:37.740
exciting you know there's still many of
the questions that I was showing earlier

00:27:37.740 --> 00:27:37.750
the questions that I was showing earlier
 

00:27:37.750 --> 00:27:39.779
the questions that I was showing earlier
that it really can't answer so this is

00:27:39.779 --> 00:27:39.789
that it really can't answer so this is
 

00:27:39.789 --> 00:27:43.200
that it really can't answer so this is
definitely not a solve problem but you

00:27:43.200 --> 00:27:43.210
definitely not a solve problem but you
 

00:27:43.210 --> 00:27:44.879
definitely not a solve problem but you
know hopefully what you can see is that

00:27:44.879 --> 00:27:44.889
know hopefully what you can see is that
 

00:27:44.889 --> 00:27:47.009
know hopefully what you can see is that
how we're starting to go up against

00:27:47.009 --> 00:27:47.019
how we're starting to go up against
 

00:27:47.019 --> 00:27:49.529
how we're starting to go up against
problems that we don't know completely

problems that we don't know completely
 

00:27:49.539 --> 00:27:51.990
problems that we don't know completely
how to solve but we're starting to solve

00:27:51.990 --> 00:27:52.000
how to solve but we're starting to solve
 

00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:55.200
how to solve but we're starting to solve
them and instead of just creating neural

00:27:55.200 --> 00:27:55.210
them and instead of just creating neural
 

00:27:55.210 --> 00:27:57.690

is that common-sense knowledge is

00:29:16.990 --> 00:29:17.000
is that common-sense knowledge is
 

00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:18.700
is that common-sense knowledge is
basically you know they refer to it as

00:29:18.700 --> 00:29:18.710
basically you know they refer to it as
 

00:29:18.710 --> 00:29:20.500

Wikipedia muster that common sense

00:29:37.570 --> 00:29:37.580
Wikipedia muster that common sense
 

00:29:37.580 --> 00:29:40.540
Wikipedia muster that common sense

not easy for us to learn from text

00:29:42.460 --> 00:29:42.470
not easy for us to learn from text
 

00:29:42.470 --> 00:29:45.340
not easy for us to learn from text
because people don't state it this this

00:29:45.340 --> 00:29:45.350
because people don't state it this this
 

00:29:45.350 --> 00:29:48.550

third work here is okay can we take some

00:29:48.550 --> 00:29:48.560
third work here is okay can we take some
 

00:29:48.560 --> 00:29:50.800
third work here is okay can we take some
of that common sense knowledge can we

00:29:50.800 --> 00:29:50.810
of that common sense knowledge can we
 

00:29:50.810 --> 00:29:54.400
of that common sense knowledge can we
learn in vector space ways to represent

00:29:54.400 --> 00:29:54.410
learn in vector space ways to represent
 

00:29:54.410 --> 00:29:56.980
learn in vector space ways to represent
information that's common sense that

00:29:56.980 --> 00:29:56.990
information that's common sense that
 

00:29:56.990 --> 00:30:00.310
information that's common sense that
that white space and attach it to other

00:30:00.310 --> 00:30:00.320
that white space and attach it to other
 

00:30:00.320 --> 00:30:03.160
that white space and attach it to other
information that that we're able to read

00:30:03.160 --> 00:30:03.170
information that that we're able to read
 

00:30:03.170 --> 00:30:06.340
information that that we're able to read
from from the web and so on now some of

00:30:06.340 --> 00:30:06.350
from from the web and so on now some of
 

00:30:06.350 --> 00:30:08.800
from from the web and so on now some of
the recent work as well as can we can we

00:30:08.800 --> 00:30:08.810
the recent work as well as can we can we
 

00:30:08.810 --> 00:30:11.680
the recent work as well as can we can we
use neural nets to basically learn what

00:30:11.680 --> 00:30:11.690
use neural nets to basically learn what
 

00:30:11.690 --> 00:30:14.830
use neural nets to basically learn what
a program is doing represent that and

00:30:14.830 --> 00:30:14.840
a program is doing represent that and
 

00:30:14.840 --> 00:30:18.390
a program is doing represent that and
then be able to execute that program

00:30:18.390 --> 00:30:18.400
then be able to execute that program
 

00:30:18.400 --> 00:30:21.700
then be able to execute that program
programs you know this right now people

00:30:21.700 --> 00:30:21.710
programs you know this right now people
 

00:30:21.710 --> 00:30:23.170
programs you know this right now people
want to try to program program that

00:30:23.170 --> 00:30:23.180
want to try to program program that
 

00:30:23.180 --> 00:30:25.330
want to try to program program that
takes a very sophisticated human skill

00:30:25.330 --> 00:30:25.340
takes a very sophisticated human skill
 

00:30:25.340 --> 00:30:27.940
takes a very sophisticated human skill
to be able to probe probe a program and

00:30:27.940 --> 00:30:27.950
to be able to probe probe a program and
 

00:30:27.950 --> 00:30:29.950
to be able to probe probe a program and
understand it and in fact humans don't

00:30:29.950 --> 00:30:29.960
understand it and in fact humans don't
 

00:30:29.960 --> 00:30:31.720
understand it and in fact humans don't
do that very well but if we could train

00:30:31.720 --> 00:30:31.730
do that very well but if we could train
 

00:30:31.730 --> 00:30:33.400
do that very well but if we could train
machines to do that and obviously that's

00:30:33.400 --> 00:30:33.410
machines to do that and obviously that's
 

00:30:33.410 --> 00:30:38.110
machines to do that and obviously that's
a very powerful thing to do we're also a

00:30:38.110 --> 00:30:38.120
a very powerful thing to do we're also a
 

00:30:38.120 --> 00:30:40.420
a very powerful thing to do we're also a
paper that was just published a couple a

00:30:40.420 --> 00:30:40.430
paper that was just published a couple a
 

00:30:40.430 --> 00:30:42.430
paper that was just published a couple a
couple of months ago in December at nib

00:30:42.430 --> 00:30:42.440
couple of months ago in December at nib
 

00:30:42.440 --> 00:30:44.250
couple of months ago in December at nib
so I thought was extremely interesting

00:30:44.250 --> 00:30:44.260
so I thought was extremely interesting
 

00:30:44.260 --> 00:30:46.950
so I thought was extremely interesting
basically they're learning how to

00:30:46.950 --> 00:30:46.960
basically they're learning how to
 

00:30:46.960 --> 00:30:50.500
basically they're learning how to
constrain vector representations such

00:30:50.500 --> 00:30:50.510
constrain vector representations such
 

00:30:50.510 --> 00:30:52.960
constrain vector representations such
that they can in

00:30:52.960 --> 00:30:52.970
that they can in
 

00:30:52.970 --> 00:30:56.499
that they can in
new rules from those and that they can

00:30:56.499 --> 00:30:56.509
new rules from those and that they can
 

00:30:56.509 --> 00:30:59.019
new rules from those and that they can
basically create proofs right so when

00:30:59.019 --> 00:30:59.029
basically create proofs right so when
 

00:30:59.029 --> 00:31:01.599
basically create proofs right so when
you the reason a proof is important is

00:31:01.599 --> 00:31:01.609
you the reason a proof is important is
 

00:31:01.609 --> 00:31:03.549
you the reason a proof is important is
basically that's the beginnings of being

00:31:03.549 --> 00:31:03.559
basically that's the beginnings of being
 

00:31:03.559 --> 00:31:06.369
basically that's the beginnings of being
able to explain an answer so when if you

00:31:06.369 --> 00:31:06.379
able to explain an answer so when if you
 

00:31:06.379 --> 00:31:09.159
able to explain an answer so when if you
ask a question of the question from some

00:31:09.159 --> 00:31:09.169
ask a question of the question from some
 

00:31:09.169 --> 00:31:10.599
ask a question of the question from some
of the other ones was you know it's it's

00:31:10.599 --> 00:31:10.609
of the other ones was you know it's it's
 

00:31:10.609 --> 00:31:15.009
of the other ones was you know it's it's
the apples in the kitchen why I think

00:31:15.009 --> 00:31:15.019
the apples in the kitchen why I think
 

00:31:15.019 --> 00:31:16.869
the apples in the kitchen why I think
you have a proof if you have the steps

00:31:16.869 --> 00:31:16.879
you have a proof if you have the steps
 

00:31:16.879 --> 00:31:18.549
you have a proof if you have the steps
that you went through in terms of the

00:31:18.549 --> 00:31:18.559
that you went through in terms of the
 

00:31:18.559 --> 00:31:21.460
that you went through in terms of the
knowledge base able to explain that out

developer cloud makes it very easy you

00:31:52.269 --> 00:31:52.279
developer cloud makes it very easy you
 

00:31:52.279 --> 00:31:53.529
developer cloud makes it very easy you
know you can do things like you handed

00:31:53.529 --> 00:31:53.539
know you can do things like you handed
 

00:31:53.539 --> 00:31:55.210
know you can do things like you handed
an image and it'll hand back information

00:31:55.210 --> 00:31:55.220
an image and it'll hand back information
 

00:31:55.220 --> 00:31:57.099
an image and it'll hand back information
about what's in that image you you hand

00:31:57.099 --> 00:31:57.109
about what's in that image you you hand
 

00:31:57.109 --> 00:31:58.749
about what's in that image you you hand
it text it'll tell you information about

00:31:58.749 --> 00:31:58.759
it text it'll tell you information about
 

00:31:58.759 --> 00:32:00.940
it text it'll tell you information about
the sentiment of that you know label

00:32:00.940 --> 00:32:00.950
the sentiment of that you know label
 

00:32:00.950 --> 00:32:02.589
the sentiment of that you know label
information within it and so on so we

00:32:02.589 --> 00:32:02.599
information within it and so on so we
 

00:32:02.599 --> 00:32:04.719
information within it and so on so we
have what we believe are very easy to

00:32:04.719 --> 00:32:04.729
have what we believe are very easy to
 

00:32:04.729 --> 00:32:05.680
have what we believe are very easy to
use

00:32:05.680 --> 00:32:05.690
use
 

00:32:05.690 --> 00:32:09.700

you know algorithms that take many of

00:32:09.700 --> 00:32:09.710
you know algorithms that take many of
 

00:32:09.710 --> 00:32:10.749
you know algorithms that take many of
these things that were I was talking

00:32:10.749 --> 00:32:10.759
these things that were I was talking
 

00:32:10.759 --> 00:32:12.549
these things that were I was talking
about earlier and make them very easy

00:32:12.549 --> 00:32:12.559
about earlier and make them very easy
 

00:32:12.559 --> 00:32:14.710
about earlier and make them very easy
for anyone to use and incorporate in

00:32:14.710 --> 00:32:14.720
for anyone to use and incorporate in
 

00:32:14.720 --> 00:32:18.129
for anyone to use and incorporate in
into their programs I think that's it

00:32:18.129 --> 00:32:18.139
into their programs I think that's it
 

00:32:18.139 --> 00:32:19.810
into their programs I think that's it
for me

00:32:19.810 --> 00:32:19.820
for me
 

00:32:19.820 --> 00:32:22.720
for me
