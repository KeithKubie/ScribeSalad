00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.440
Welcome back.

00:00:01.440 --> 00:00:03.950
I'll now do a couple of more
momentum problems.

00:00:03.950 --> 00:00:07.060
So this first problem, I have
this ice skater and she's on

00:00:07.060 --> 00:00:08.630
an ice skating rink.

00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:10.360
And what she's doing is
she's holding a ball.

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:14.740
And this ball-- let me draw
the ball-- this is a 0.15

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:15.990
kilogram ball.

00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:20.580
And she throws it.

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:23.640
Let's just say she throws it
directly straight forward in

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:25.200
front of her, although
she's staring at us.

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:27.230
She's actually forward
for her body.

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:32.790
So she throws it exactly
straight forward.

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:35.075
And I understand it is hard to
throw something straight

00:00:35.075 --> 00:00:38.490
forward, but let's assume
that she can.

00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:41.510
So she throws it exactly
straight forward with a

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:44.280
speed-- or since we're going to
give the direction as well,

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:48.000
it's a velocity, right, cause
speed is just a magnitude

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.200
while a velocity is a magnitude
and a direction-- so

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:58.160
she throws the ball at 35 meters
per second, and this

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:03.160
ball is 0.15 kilograms.

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:08.560
Now, what the problem says is
that their combined mass, her

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:17.520
plus the ball, is 50 kilograms.
So they're both

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:20.130
stationary before she does
anything, and then she throws

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.990
this ball, and the question is,
after throwing this ball,

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:25.000
what is her recoil velocity?

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.930
Or essentially, well how much,
by throwing the ball, does she

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:30.230
push herself backwards?

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:33.060
So what is her velocity in
the backward direction?

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:36.340
And if you're not familiar with
the term recoil, it's

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:39.600
often applied to when someone,
I guess, not that we want to

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:42.250
think about violent things, but
if you shoot a gun, your

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:44.830
shoulder recoils back,
because once

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:45.900
again momentum is conserved.

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:48.270
So there's a certain amount of
momentum going into that

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:51.020
bullet, which is very light
and fast going forward.

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:54.940
But since momentum is conserved,
your shoulder has

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:55.780
velocity backwards.

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:57.250
But we'll do another
problem with that.

00:01:57.250 --> 00:01:58.960
So let's get back
to this problem.

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:02.410
So like I just said, momentum
is conserved.

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:05.760
So what's the momentum at the
start of the problem, the

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:08.289
initial momentum?

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:09.690
Let me do a different color.

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:11.730
So this is the initial
momentum.

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:18.060
Initially, the mass is 50
kilograms, right, cause her

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:22.110
and the ball combined are 50
kilograms, times the velocity.

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:23.810
Well the velocity is 0.

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:29.800
So initially, there is 0
velocity in the system.

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:34.060
So the momentum is 0.

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:37.430
The P initial is equal to 0.

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:41.560
And since we start with a net 0
momentum, we have to finish

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:42.880
with a net 0 momentum.

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:44.030
So what's momentum later?

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:47.730
Well we have a ball moving at
35 meters per second and the

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:58.040
ball has a mass of 0.15
kilograms. I'll ignore the

00:02:58.040 --> 00:02:59.710
units for now just
to save space.

00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:01.930
Times the velocity
of the ball.

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:05.060
Times 35 meters per second.

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:08.930
So this is the momentum of the
ball plus the new momentum of

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:10.020
the figure skater.

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:12.060
So what's her mass?

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:14.440
Well her mass is going
to be 50 minus this.

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:21.550
It actually won't matter a ton,
but let's say it's 49--

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:25.330
what is that-- 49.85 kilograms,

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:28.180
times her new velocity.

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:29.040
Times velocity.

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:31.410
Let's call that the velocity
of the skater.

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:34.890
So let me get my trusty
calculator out.

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:40.640
OK, so let's see.

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:50.780
0.15 times 35 is
equal to 5.25.

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:56.260
So that equals 5.25.

00:03:56.260 --> 00:04:02.350
plus 49.85 times the skater's
velocity, the final velocity.

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:04.550
And of course, this equals
0 because the initial

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:05.930
velocity was 0.

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:10.000
So let's, I don't know, subtract
5.25 from both sides

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:18.200
and then the equation becomes
minus 5.25 is equal to 49.85

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:20.279
times the velocity
of the skater.

00:04:20.279 --> 00:04:23.480
So we're essentially saying that
the momentum of just the

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:25.380
ball is 5.25.

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:29.480
And since the combined system
has to have 0 net momentum,

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:32.660
we're saying that the momentum
of the skater has to be 5.25

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:35.960
in the other direction, going
backwards, or has a momentum

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:39.230
of minus 5.25.

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:41.480
And to figure out the velocity,
we just divide her

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:43.780
momentum by her mass.

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:48.380
And so divide both sides by
49.85 and you get the velocity

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:49.695
of the skater.

00:04:49.695 --> 00:04:50.725
So let's see.

00:04:50.725 --> 00:05:01.520
Let's make this a negative
number divided by 49.85 equals

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:05.370
minus 0.105.

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:15.520
So minus 0.105 meters
per second.

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:16.270
So that's interesting.

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:20.370
When she throws this ball out at
35 meters per second, which

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:24.670
is pretty fast, she will
recoil back at about 10

00:05:24.670 --> 00:05:28.440
centimeters, yeah, roughly 10
centimeters per second.

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:30.530
So she will recoil a lot
slower, although

00:05:30.530 --> 00:05:31.740
she will move back.

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:34.350
And if you think about it, this
is a form of propulsion.

00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:35.790
This is how rockets work.

00:05:35.790 --> 00:05:40.120
They eject something that maybe
has less mass, but super

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:44.500
fast. And that, since we have a
conservation of momentum, it

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:47.740
makes the rocket move in
the other direction.

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:51.550
Well anyway, let's see if we
could fit another problem in.

00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:54.600
Actually, it's probably better
to leave this problem done and

00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:56.760
then I'll have more time for the
next problem, which will

00:05:56.760 --> 00:05:58.515
be slightly more difficult.

00:05:58.515 --> 00:05:59.765
See you soon.
