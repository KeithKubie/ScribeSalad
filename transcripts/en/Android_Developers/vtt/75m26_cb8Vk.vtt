00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:09.900
Most of AliExpress mobile users are Android users

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.660
Our Android app has over 50 million downloads globally

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:16.480
We have users from over 200 countries

00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:22.980
Our main buyer markets include United States, Russia, Spain and France

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:27.600
It is one of the most popular shopping apps in over 20 countries

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:30.660
We are also a Top Developer on Google Play

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.600
We implemented Google Sign-In last year

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:38.020
it allows users to sign into AliExpress with their Google account

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:41.520
Now over 10% of our users use Google Sign-In

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:45.380
more than any other 3rd party sign in feature that we offer

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:48.440
We also recently implemented the smart-lock feature

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.180
it allows users to save their password

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:53.960
and use their saved password to sign in

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.160
We continued to see positive feedback from users

00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:01.280
so we progressed to allowing users to sign in automatically

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:02.840
when they open our app

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:05.000
After we implemented smart-lock

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:10.500
our sign-in success rate increased from 84% to 92%

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:14.980
We realized early on that the material design makes it easier

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:17.760
for our Android users to navigate the app

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:23.420
So in early 2015, our app went through a significant design change

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:27.760
to make sure we are fully compliant with the Material Design guidelines

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:34.180
After the update, we received a lot of 5-star user reviews praising our design

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:38.180
and our user rating improved to 4.46

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:43.020
Many mobile users of Alibaba Group are Android users

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:46.160
We have reaped enormous benefits

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:48.320
in terms of user engagement

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:51.960
by leveraging the unique features offered by Android

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:55.580
We recently previewed the upcoming Android N

00:01:56.020 --> 00:02:00.460
and are very excited about features like multi-window mode

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:04.880
And we will try our best to implement them as fast as possible

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:07.980
to further improve our customer experience
