00:00:03.575 --> 00:00:04.950
The idea behind
Project Night was

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:09.390
that we all like to learn by
making things and tinkering.

00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:11.820
And we wanted to
create a community

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:13.950
around tinkering at Harvard.

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:17.490
So every week, we host an event
in the Active Learning Labs

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:20.640
or in the Science Center where
students or staff or community

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:22.890
members from all
across campus can come

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:25.050
and hang out, build
stuff for fun.

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:25.860
We have pizza.

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:27.600
People work on
personal projects.

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:29.520
And every week,
we have a workshop

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:32.420
to do some sort of
quick hands-on projects

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:34.920
so that people who don't already
have their own design ideas

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:37.710
can still have an easy entry
point into the community.

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:39.570
So the hope is
both to have people

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:43.470
kind of in the space learning
by building with tools

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:45.040
and experimenting
with engineering

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:47.370
but also to be an
open environment where

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:50.727
anyone can come and feel safe
and try out those new things.

00:00:50.727 --> 00:00:52.560
One of the big benefits
of the whole project

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:57.840
was that we did work together
and saw each other for a couple

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:59.460
of years on a weekly basis.

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:02.460
Well, it started to get
really comfortable to go

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:07.580
over and share other
people's shop space.

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:12.000
I started to expand
where I thought I

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.150
was at home in the university.

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:18.600
And we shared a lot of things
like shop safety practices

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:22.050
and training practices that
I think have benefited--

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:24.350
certainly benefited us.

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:26.550
I think it's also helped
with collaboration.

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:29.843
So, for instance, we have a
tool that they don't have,

00:01:29.843 --> 00:01:31.260
or they have a
tool we don't have.

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:33.090
It's made it a lot
easier to be like, hey,

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:34.970
can we borrow that for the day?

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:36.810
Or you have expertise
in this thing.

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:38.410
Can you help out
with this one class

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:40.230
that we don't have expertise in?

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:41.820
Yeah, or there's a
couple of classes

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:43.487
that are totally
outside of this project

00:01:43.487 --> 00:01:45.570
that we've gone to them
for help on since they've

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:48.900
got a lot of expertise in
hands-on demonstrations.

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:50.490
And it's been super
helpful outside

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:52.950
of this project in terms of
the regular academic stuff we

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:54.540
support as well.

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:57.060
And in general expanding of
Harvard community, like Daniel

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:58.710
said, has been great.

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:01.980
And likewise, we have sent a
lot of students down to you

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:05.370
to laser cut, to bend
saw, to do things--

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:07.380
Likewise for the shop bot.

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:09.370
--that aren't easy
to do in our labs.

00:02:09.370 --> 00:02:11.190
It's a very big mix of people.

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:12.690
I think we originally
thought it was

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:14.610
going to be mostly
undergrads, but we actually

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:16.440
got a huge group the first year.

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:19.020
Especially, we got a huge
group of the master's

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:20.310
of design engineering.

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:22.170
Basically, the entire
cohort would come over

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:23.040
to Project Night.

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:23.957
That was a lot of fun.

00:02:23.957 --> 00:02:27.390
So we had a good mix of
undergrads, master's students,

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:30.480
and then we had a few people
that have been coming regularly

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:33.220
that are within the greater
Harvard communities,

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:35.035
so some Ed school
students, some people--

00:02:35.035 --> 00:02:35.910
We've got some staff.

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:35.940
--some staff.

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:36.820
A couple of staff people.

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:38.760
Yeah, we did a survey
at the end of last year.

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:40.980
And we're in the midst
of one right now also.

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:44.830
And I think I don't have
actual numbers right now.

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:46.740
But the general trend
was that I think

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:50.870
people felt benefits were really
good for learning skills that

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:53.370
were also applicable to classes,
particularly people who are

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:55.890
using shop stuff in classes.

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:59.350
We've gotten a lot of
people learning electronics

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:01.940
and basic circuitry.

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:04.230
And I think there were
a fair number of people

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:07.620
who said that Project Night
was helpful for not only skills

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:10.706
but also motivation
in their STEM classes.

00:03:10.706 --> 00:03:13.750
So I think, overall, it's been
helpful for people outside

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:15.355
of fun also.

00:03:15.355 --> 00:03:17.980
I think it's helped people with
their presence in the labs too,

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:21.280
because there's, at least
on the engineering side--

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:23.380
when we see students
around a lot,

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:26.020
they tend to be more
involved with the community

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:28.447
and more involved
with their courses.

00:03:28.447 --> 00:03:30.280
And I think they do
better just because they

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:31.852
build that community.

00:03:31.852 --> 00:03:34.060
So I think it's definitely
helped them on that front,

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:37.090
whether the students
realize it or not.

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:38.853
I think I've seen
a lot of things

00:03:38.853 --> 00:03:40.270
at Harvard where
you start and you

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:42.880
have all this motivation
at the beginning,

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:43.952
and it's really exciting.

00:03:43.952 --> 00:03:45.910
And then over time, it
just kind of peters off.

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:47.717
But this is still going strong.

00:03:47.717 --> 00:03:49.300
And I think even
after the HILT grant,

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:52.270
I think we've convinced
people that it's still

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:53.580
an important aspect.

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:55.960
So I think it'll just
continue to happen.

00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:57.850
Yeah, I think,
when we started, it

00:03:57.850 --> 00:04:02.175
was a thing we were all
passionate about that

00:04:02.175 --> 00:04:04.300
wasn't necessarily something
everyone was convinced

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:05.090
was worthwhile.

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:06.760
And I think people
have explicitly told

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:10.030
us that from the management side
that they see the value in it

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:12.390
and want to keep on
doing more making stuff,

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:15.460
and that's kind of
folded into regular plans

00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:19.130
for what we do as a group
within the university.

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:22.597
And we've been doing these
weekly during the semesters

00:04:22.597 --> 00:04:23.680
now for a year and a half.

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:28.347
And I think that's also
something that feels,

00:04:28.347 --> 00:04:28.930
like you said.

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:30.790
Actually having it
happen consistently

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:32.440
has felt really nice.

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:35.170
And we've had people who've
come pretty much every week

00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:36.280
for that year and a half.

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:38.530
Yeah, I think the thing
that I'm proud of is

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:42.670
that we managed to establish
a community of people

00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:44.330
who do get together.

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:48.510
And there's definitely
a core group

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:53.170
that you see every Project
Night, people working

00:04:53.170 --> 00:04:56.770
on projects that they're
just really excited

00:04:56.770 --> 00:05:00.790
about and also
people just bouncing

00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:05.530
back and forth between projects
and then helping others work.

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:07.870
Yeah, I think I'm
proud of the community.

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:09.420
Mhm.
