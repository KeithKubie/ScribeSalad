Tiny tools are a big part of our
technological legacy, of who we are as a

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:10.290
species. Prior to our study most people
assumed that miniaturization was a recent

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:13.440
phenomenon, that it was something that
happened late in our evolutionary

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:18.930
history, associated with things like
microchips and modern technologies. And

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:23.250
what we've actually shown, is that the
process of miniaturization is probably

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:28.100
the most important and long-term
technological phenomena related to our

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:33.140
evolution. It's been there for almost
ever. To most people, a tool like this,

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:37.950
a miniaturized stone flake, seems pretty
feeble. But in fact, these are some of the

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:42.560
most effective tools that our species
and our ancestors have ever made.

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:47.780
It marks key behavioral changes for our
species, the first of them being when we

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:51.870
started to systematically use stone
tools to cut meat, the second one when we

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:55.500
started to develop high speed weapon
systems about a hundred thousand years

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:01.230
ago, and lastly, when we dealt with some
of the most challenging aspects of

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:05.800
climate change at the end of the last
ice age. Small tools were there to help

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:10.680
us and they have been and they continue
to be, and it's one of our lasting

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:14.780
legacies as a technological species.
