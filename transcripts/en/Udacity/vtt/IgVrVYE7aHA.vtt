00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:03.000
Now that we have our ABO MRNA complete, what's next?

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.550
&gt;&gt; Well the next step is to bring that MRNA copy out of

00:00:06.550 --> 00:00:10.760
the nucleus and into the cytoplasm where it can be translated into protein.

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:14.220
&gt;&gt; Okay, going back to the cake analogy we now have a recipe copied

00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:18.020
in the kitchen, we're ready to cook but. What are the ingredients to a protein?

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:20.570
&gt;&gt; Right, I guess you know the ingredients for food and now you know

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:23.560
the ingredients for DNA there are ingredients

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:25.880
for proteins and they're called amino acids.

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:29.070
Amino acids are the basic building blocks of proteins, unlike

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:32.049
DNA which only has four ingredients. Proteins are made up

00:00:32.049 --> 00:00:35.160
of amino acids, 20 different kinds of them. Each of

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:38.170
these amino acids, has its own name, its own chemical structure.

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:40.580
And they can be strung together in a row, in

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:44.380
a sequence just like our DNA letters could. Now, each amino

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:46.988
acid has its own name and its own abbreviation. We

00:00:46.988 --> 00:00:50.890
have three letter abbreviations and one letter abbreviations. We're going to

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:52.690
go back and forth using them, so try

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:55.030
to familiarize yourself with both. But if you

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:57.180
ever get stuck, you're one Google search away

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:59.030
from trying to remember exactly what you need.

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:03.780
&gt;&gt; That's a lot of ingredients. So, there's four in a DNA, and then there's 20

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:05.840
that make up the proteins. But how do

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:09.050
those four DNA ingredients correspond to the amino acids.

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:12.240
&gt;&gt; That is a really good question and it's what we're about to explore.
