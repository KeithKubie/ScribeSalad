00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.570
 

00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:03.110
We've done a bunch of examples
looking at the actual

00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:06.070
molecular structure and trying
to come up with the name.

00:00:06.070 --> 00:00:07.960
In this video, we'll go
the other way around.

00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:11.020
We'll start with the name and
see if we can actually draw

00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:14.810
the molecular structure of
whatever this might be.

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:15.530
So let's start.

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:17.400
When you first look at these,
it's very daunting, but you

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:19.970
always want to start really at
the end, so you know what kind

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:21.930
of the core of the structure
is going to be.

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:24.790
So if you look at the end of
this, you have an -ane, so

00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:26.915
there's not going to be any
double or triple bonds here.

00:00:26.915 --> 00:00:28.350
It's all single bonds.

00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:33.790
It's a hexadecane, so let's
think about that.

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:38.170
Hexadec-, that's six and ten.

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:42.520
Hexadec- was a prefix for
16, so this is 16

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:50.640
single-bonded carbons.

00:00:50.640 --> 00:01:01.150
And cyclohexadecane, so 16
single-bonded carbons in a

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:03.680
ring, so this part
of it right here.

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:04.440
So let me just do this.

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:09.730
So cyclohexadecane, let's draw
that part first. It's not easy

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:15.480
to draw even a 16-carbon ring,
so let's start here.

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:31.790
One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight, nine, ten,

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:39.130
eleven, twelve, thirteen,
fourteen,

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:42.550
fifteen, and then sixteen.

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:43.230
I think I got it.

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:45.400
Let me count them again and
then I can connect them up

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:45.970
into cycles.

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:50.120
It's one, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight, nine,

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:53.900
ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen,
fourteen, fifteen, sixteen.

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:57.690
All right, I drew the
cyclohexadecane part.

00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:00.710
Now, if we go back a little,
let's see, we have a

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:01.960
2,9-diisopropyl.

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:04.250
 

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:04.930
What does this mean?

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:07.970
This means that we have an
isopropyl at the two

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:09.940
and the nine spot.

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:13.690
Now when you are drawing the
structure from the name, you

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:16.780
could just arbitrarily on
someplace on this ring pick

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:19.420
what your one through your
sixteen spots are.

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:22.830
I'll just arbitrarily pick them,
because I could have

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:24.540
drawn this ring any which way.

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:32.420
One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight, nine, ten,

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:39.550
eleven, twelve, thirteen,
fourteen, fifteen, sixteen.

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:42.770
All right, so this next
piece right here, let

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:44.390
me do this in magenta.

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:48.820
2,9-diisopropyl, this is telling
us that at spot number

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:53.660
two and at spot number nine,
I have isopropyl.

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:56.650
The di- is just saying I have
two isopropyls at two and

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:58.750
nine, so you can kind
of ignore the di-.

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:01.240
I have an isopropyl, and you may
or may not remember that

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:02.680
an isopropyl looks like this.

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:08.020
It's three carbons, so it's
going to be one, two, three,

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:11.640
and the connection point to the
main ring in this case is

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:13.120
going to be in the middle
carbon, so it

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:14.180
kind of forms a Y.

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:17.820
All of the isos, the isopropyl,
isobutyl, they all

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:21.840
look like Y's, so it's going to
be linked right over here.

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:24.620
 

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:27.550
That's also going to happen at
the ninth carbon, so at the

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:30.550
ninth carbon we're going to
have another isopropyl.

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:34.750
We're going to have another
isopropyl at the ninth carbon.

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:37.970
All right, we've taken care
of the 2,9-isopropyl.

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:44.840
Then we have the 6-ethyl, which
is just a two carbon.

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:49.740
Remember, meth- is one, eth-
is two, prop- is three.

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:51.780
Let me write this down.

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:56.600
So this is going to be prop-
is equal to three.

00:03:56.600 --> 00:04:04.240
Isoprop- is equal to that type
of shape right over there.

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:10.760
In this case, eth- is equal to
two, so it's a 6-ethyl group.

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:15.380
So at six we have an ethyl
group, so one, two, carbons,

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:19.930
and it's connected at the six
carbon on the main ring.

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:21.190
And then finally we have
a cyclopentyl.

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:24.800
 

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:29.950
So if we look at-- let me find
a color I haven't used yet--

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:30.700
cyclopentyl.

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:35.080
so pent- is five, but it's five
in a cycle, so this is a

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:37.160
five-carbon ring that's
branching

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:38.090
off of the main ring.

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:40.800
It's at the first spot.

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:44.940
Let me draw a five-carbon rings,
so pent- is equal to

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:48.410
five, so it would look
like this, one: two,

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:50.285
three, four, five.

00:04:50.285 --> 00:04:52.140
It looks just like a pentagon.

00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:55.640
That's a cyclopentyl group and
it's attached to the one

00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:59.190
carbon on my cyclohexadecane,
so it is

00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:01.370
attached just like that.

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:01.840
We're done.

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:02.680
We've drawn 1-cyclopentyl-6-
ethyl-2,9-diisop

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:03.930
ropylcyclohexadecane.

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:07.440
 

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:09.590
Let's do another one.

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:11.360
I think we're getting
the hang of it.

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:15.380
So here, maybe we can do this
one a little bit faster.

00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:19.180
Let's see, we have a
tetramethyldodecane, so the

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:23.320
main root here is the
dodecane, do- for

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:24.650
two, dec- for ten.

00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:26.210
This is a 12-carbon chain.

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:29.310
It's not in a cycle, so let
me just draw it out.

00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:36.180
We have one, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight, nine,

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:39.930
ten, eleven, twelve, and so
we can just number them

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:41.510
arbitrarily, just because
I could have drawn

00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:42.160
this any which way.

00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:50.200
So it's one, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight, nine,

00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:52.860
ten, eleven, twelve.

00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:55.600
That's the dodecane,
all single bonds.

00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:58.960
Then we have a
3,6,9,9-tetramethyl.

00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:02.565
All this is telling us--
remember, meth- is one carbon,

00:06:02.565 --> 00:06:05.520
so all this is telling us is
at the three, the six, the

00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:11.150
nine, so at the three, the six
and twice at the nine spot, we

00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:13.520
have methyl groups, and we
have four methyl groups.

00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:15.070
That's all the tetramethyl
is saying so it's

00:06:15.070 --> 00:06:15.800
a little bit redundant.

00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:18.820
We know we have four of
them here: 3,6,9,9.

00:06:18.820 --> 00:06:22.270
We have methyl groups at
each of those places.

00:06:22.270 --> 00:06:26.990
We have one methyl group at
three, and then that is bonded

00:06:26.990 --> 00:06:29.590
with the third carbon on
the dodecane chain.

00:06:29.590 --> 00:06:33.570
We have one at six bonded
to the six carbon on

00:06:33.570 --> 00:06:34.540
the dodecane chain.

00:06:34.540 --> 00:06:39.320
We have two at nine, so that's
one at nine and then we have

00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:42.130
another one at nine bonded
to the nine carbon on the

00:06:42.130 --> 00:06:43.100
dodecane chain.

00:06:43.100 --> 00:06:43.890
And we're done.

00:06:43.890 --> 00:06:44.590
That's it.

00:06:44.590 --> 00:06:45.840
That's 3,6,9,9-
tetramethyldodecane.

00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:48.450
 

00:06:48.450 --> 00:06:51.480
Let's do another one.

00:06:51.480 --> 00:06:52.730
1,3-bis(1,1-dime
thylethyl)cyclopentane.

00:06:52.730 --> 00:06:58.050
 

00:06:58.050 --> 00:07:01.080
So once again, just kind
of breathe slowly.

00:07:01.080 --> 00:07:04.230
It's very daunting right when
you look at it, but just start

00:07:04.230 --> 00:07:06.670
with the core: cyclopentane.

00:07:06.670 --> 00:07:09.185
That's just a simple
five-carbon ring.

00:07:09.185 --> 00:07:12.290
A five carbon ring that looks
like a pentagon: one, two,

00:07:12.290 --> 00:07:17.270
three, four, five.

00:07:17.270 --> 00:07:19.910
 

00:07:19.910 --> 00:07:21.060
There you go.

00:07:21.060 --> 00:07:22.650
That is a five-carbon ring.

00:07:22.650 --> 00:07:26.220
We can number it however we
want, so one, two, three,

00:07:26.220 --> 00:07:28.290
four, and five.

00:07:28.290 --> 00:07:35.260
This is telling us at the one
and the three position we

00:07:35.260 --> 00:07:37.360
have-- and the bis- is
kind of redundant.

00:07:37.360 --> 00:07:38.810
This is saying we have
two of these things.

00:07:38.810 --> 00:07:39.560
Obviously, we have two.

00:07:39.560 --> 00:07:40.990
We have one at the one
and one at the three.

00:07:40.990 --> 00:07:42.250
So you can kind of
ignore the bis-.

00:07:42.250 --> 00:07:43.600
That's just the convention
and we've seen

00:07:43.600 --> 00:07:44.740
that multiple times.

00:07:44.740 --> 00:07:46.440
But at each of those positions,
we have a

00:07:46.440 --> 00:07:47.690
1,1-dimethylethyl.

00:07:47.690 --> 00:07:49.370
 

00:07:49.370 --> 00:07:51.800
So what's a dimethylethyl
look like?

00:07:51.800 --> 00:07:53.830
So let's think about
it a little bit.

00:07:53.830 --> 00:07:57.280
Let's think about it and
let me do it orange.

00:07:57.280 --> 00:08:00.860
They obviously named it using
systematic naming and what we

00:08:00.860 --> 00:08:03.960
have here, we have an ethyl
as kind of the core

00:08:03.960 --> 00:08:05.650
of this side chain.

00:08:05.650 --> 00:08:09.620
So if an ethyl is equal to two
carbons, so this is two

00:08:09.620 --> 00:08:10.970
carbons right there.

00:08:10.970 --> 00:08:15.320
So let me draw a two
carbon: one, two.

00:08:15.320 --> 00:08:18.140
That is two carbons
right over there.

00:08:18.140 --> 00:08:19.820
I'm just drawing it
at the three spot.

00:08:19.820 --> 00:08:21.700
I'll draw it also at the
one spot, actually.

00:08:21.700 --> 00:08:23.630
So that is two carbons
right there.

00:08:23.630 --> 00:08:24.970
That's the ethyl part.

00:08:24.970 --> 00:08:27.380
And then on 1,1, so if we number
them, we number where

00:08:27.380 --> 00:08:31.330
it's connected, so
it's one, two.

00:08:31.330 --> 00:08:33.179
This is saying 1,1-dimethyl.

00:08:33.179 --> 00:08:36.570
So on this ethyl chain,
you have two methyls.

00:08:36.570 --> 00:08:40.690
Remember, methyl is equal to
one, so this is one carbon.

00:08:40.690 --> 00:08:41.809
You have one carbon.

00:08:41.809 --> 00:08:44.600
That's what methyl is, but
you have two of them.

00:08:44.600 --> 00:08:45.950
You have dimethyl.

00:08:45.950 --> 00:08:47.760
You have it twice
at the one spot.

00:08:47.760 --> 00:08:50.550
So you have one methyl here
and then you have another

00:08:50.550 --> 00:08:51.140
methyl there.

00:08:51.140 --> 00:08:51.910
Same thing over here.

00:08:51.910 --> 00:08:54.090
You have 1-methyl on the one
spot and then you have another

00:08:54.090 --> 00:08:55.750
1-methyl on the one spot.

00:08:55.750 --> 00:09:00.110
And then you are connected at
positions one and positions

00:09:00.110 --> 00:09:03.940
three, so you're connected there
and you are connected

00:09:03.940 --> 00:09:05.290
right over there.

00:09:05.290 --> 00:09:06.930
And you're done, That's it.

00:09:06.930 --> 00:09:08.560
That is our structure.

00:09:08.560 --> 00:09:12.970
Now, if you did this with common
naming, instead of this

00:09:12.970 --> 00:09:15.880
group being a 1,1-dimethylethyl,
you might

00:09:15.880 --> 00:09:18.120
see that we're connected to
a group that has one, two,

00:09:18.120 --> 00:09:20.170
three, four carbons in it.

00:09:20.170 --> 00:09:22.520
The carbon that we're connected
to branches off to

00:09:22.520 --> 00:09:23.415
three other carbons.

00:09:23.415 --> 00:09:25.960
It is a tert-butyl.

00:09:25.960 --> 00:09:30.450
So you can also call
this a 1,3-- let me

00:09:30.450 --> 00:09:31.390
just write it down.

00:09:31.390 --> 00:09:39.100
So another name for this would
be 1,3-tert-- or sometimes

00:09:39.100 --> 00:09:48.070
people just write a t there--
t-butylcyclo-- no, actually I

00:09:48.070 --> 00:09:51.890
should say di-t-butyl, because
we have two of them.

00:09:51.890 --> 00:09:53.140
1,3-di-t-butylcyclopentane.

00:09:53.140 --> 00:10:03.333
