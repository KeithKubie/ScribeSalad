00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:05.299
Japan is set to unveil a hotel that replaces
room keys with facial recognition and replaces

00:00:05.299 --> 00:00:07.279
humans with robots.

00:00:07.279 --> 00:00:12.030
And researchers in Chile recently recorded
the velvet worm shooting a sticky web like

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:13.030
Spiderman.

00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:14.570
It's a glue cannon.

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:15.570
Vsauce!

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:18.830
Kevin here - this is Mind Blow.

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:24.599
The Digital Brain Library is slicing up and
preserving human brains.

00:00:24.599 --> 00:00:30.369
Based in San Diego, this brain bank not only
slices human brains into micron-thin pieces,

00:00:30.369 --> 00:00:34.270
but also digitizes them at extremely high
resolutions.

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:39.270
And this digital archive will be used to create
the Google Earth of the human brain.

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:44.590
Warka Water has developed a bamboo tower that
collects water from the air.

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:49.600
Designed for rural communities with limited
access to potable water, the Warka Tower stores

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:52.150
water from rain, dew, and fog.

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:56.321
The tower looks to be cheaper than current
water relief options so the hope is that it

00:00:56.321 --> 00:00:59.570
will give rural villages stable access to
water.

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:04.170
The Lucid Pipe Power system is designed to
generate electricity with the help of your

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:05.170
sewage.

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:10.820
By installing turbines into existing waterlines
the Lucid Pipe generates clean energy by utilizing

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:13.700
the water flow that’s happening underground
anyway.

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:18.530
Unlike solar and wind energy it isn’t dependent
upon the weather as it takes advantage of

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:20.560
the day to day human activity.

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:23.710
This is a self-fueled liquid metal motor.

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:28.810
The drop of metal alloy is suspended in a
solution of sodium hydroxide and is fueled

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:30.549
by a flake of aluminum.

00:01:30.549 --> 00:01:35.240
And this team is literally trying to make
intelligent robots that can change shape.

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:36.909
So yeah.

00:01:36.909 --> 00:01:41.370
Researchers at University of California, Berkeley,
have managed to grow human heart cells on

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:42.440
a computer chip.

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:47.260
They’re grown from stem cells and surrounded
by micro fluid channels which supply them

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:49.049
with nutrients and drugs.

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:53.370
The heart cells could be modified to model
human genetic diseases and could eliminate

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:56.119
the need for the animal testing of drugs.

00:01:56.119 --> 00:01:59.850
New Jersey is building the world’s largest
indoor vertical farm.

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:05.159
It’s currently under construction and plans
to grow two million pounds of food each year,

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:06.159
without soil.

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:11.840
The farm will use colored LEDS and nutrient-rich
liquid solutions to grow leafy greens as well

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:16.340
as herbs and spices, and represents a huge
step in urban farming.

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:19.310
The Voxel8 can 3D print electronics.

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:24.920
&nbsp;By utilizing an ink that’s over 5,000
times more conductive than current conductive

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:30.200
paste and filaments, the device can print
electronic parts that were previously impossible

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:31.200
to make.

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:35.819
The printers start shipping in late 2015,
but you can pre-order them now, so you can

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:38.970
start designing your 3D printed drone.

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:44.250
Researchers at MIT have developed a new way
to stimulate brain tissue with magnets.

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:48.821
By injecting magnetic iron oxide particles
into the brain, and then exposing them to

00:02:48.821 --> 00:02:53.560
an alternating magnetic field, the particles
heat up and stimulate their surrounding brain

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:54.560
tissue.

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:58.420
This new method could revolutionize the way
neurological diseases like parkinson's are

00:02:58.420 --> 00:02:59.420
treated.

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:04.560
And the procedure is wireless non-invasive,
and could be remote controlled.

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:08.030
H++ is developing interactive holographic
systems.

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:12.440
The holus will be a home appliance for interactive
holographic games and apps, and the Magic

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:15.670
Room will be a virtual interactive playspace
for children.

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:20.220
Finally, here’s the beta version of Tega
- one of the many social robots being developed

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:25.450
by the Personal Robots Group.

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:40.130
I’m going to leave you with a robot that
can balance on one foot while interacting

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:41.210
with humans.

00:03:41.210 --> 00:04:19.190
And as always - thanks for watching.
