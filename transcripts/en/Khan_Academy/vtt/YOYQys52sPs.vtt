00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.410
We now know how to find the area of rectangles.

00:00:03.410 --> 00:00:04.939
What I want to do in this video,

00:00:04.939 --> 00:00:07.920
is think about how we can find the areas of triangles.

00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:11.190
So, we're starting here with a right triangle,

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:13.140
has a 90 degree angle right over here.

00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:14.820
Right triangle ABC.

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:17.120
And let's think about how we can find this area.

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:21.290
Well, maybe we can construct a rectangle out of triangle ABC.

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:24.310
And if we can construct a rectangle out if it, and then, maybe we can

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:26.760
somehow find our area of part of that rectangle.

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:30.770
And the best way to construct a rectangle is to really duplicate ABC,

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:33.620
and then flip it over and put it right on top of this.

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:36.610
And just to verify, that definitely will be a rectangle.

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:38.890
So we know that this is 90 degrees right over here.

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:41.420
Let's say that this is x degrees right over there.

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:45.550
We have x + 90 + this thing have to be equal to 180.

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:48.420
So, this thing and this thing have to add up to 90.

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:51.590
Let's just call this 90-x.

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:54.630
Now, let's flip this thing and rotate it around,

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:56.780
so that it will look like this.

00:00:56.780 --> 00:00:58.770
So, then you would have another triangle

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:00.640
that would look just like this.

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:03.610
Where now, this right angle,

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:06.500
on the flipped version is that right angle right over there.

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:08.680
This angle right over here, this x,

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:10.580
is now this angle right over there.

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:14.480
And this 90-x is now this angle, right over there.

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:18.580
And you can see x + 90-x, that'll give you a right angle.

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:22.730
And then you have x + 90-x, that gives you a right angle.

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:25.510
And you have four sides and four right angles,

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:27.720
you're definitely dealing with a rectangle.

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:31.610
And this rectangle has two of our original triangles in it.

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:37.220
So, we can write, we can write that the area of triangle ABC,

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:40.550
the area of triangle ABC, that's what the brackets mean,

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:42.020
area of triangle ABC,

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:47.050
is going to be equal to ? * the area of our entire rectangle.

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:49.770
And our entire rectangle, let me add another point here.

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:55.620
Let me call this D, is going to be ? the area of rectangle ABCD.

00:01:55.620 --> 00:02:00.800
And we know how to find the area of rectangle ABCD.

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:02.760
It's going to be equal to,

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:05.370
it's going to be equal to the base of the rectangle.

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:10.639
So, this is going to be equal to ? * and so this part right over here.

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:11.710
Let me just use a different color.

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:16.940
The area of ABCD is equal to the base or the width of the rectangle.

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:19.570
So, that's just the length of BC.

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:23.080
I'm just putting this in parentheses, it doesn't meanďź I just,

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:25.220
BC is just the length of this segment right over here

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:26.410
I'm just putting in the parentheses

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:28.060
so that we don't get the letters jumbled up.

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:30.950
So it's going to be this width or this base right here

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:33.710
times the height of the rectangle.

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:35.250
So, times AD.

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:38.900
Timesďź sorry, times AB.

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:41.360
So, it's this base * this height

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:42.780
gives us the area of the entire rectangle.

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:45.570
And the area of a right triangle is half of that.

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:46.660
So, there we have it.

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:52.220
It's ? * this base * this height.

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:54.190
It's the area of a right triangle.

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:56.070
So, in general if you ever have a right triangle,

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:57.960
if you ever have a right triangle,

00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:01.590
and this is a right angle right over there which is,

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:04.130
you need one right angle in order for it to be a right triangle.

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:08.600
And this base has length B, and this side over here has length H.

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:10.010
You know that the area,

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:19.030
the area is going to be equal to ? * the base of the triangle.

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:23.890
That's the base of the triangle BC * the height of the triangle.

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:27.330
So you can view it this way, if you look at the actual letter points.

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:29.750
And if you just use these measures as a base * height,

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:30.920
it's just ? base * height.

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:34.280
And we only that this works right now for a right triangle.

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:36.600
Now, let's think about it for other types of triangles

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:38.310
that aren't necessarily right triangles.

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:42.180
So, here I have a kind of an arbitrary triangle ABC.

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:45.570
And to approach figuring out its area,

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:48.450
what I wanna do is just split this up into two right triangles.

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:52.070
So what I'm gonna do is draw a perpendicular from B,

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:55.110
so I'm just gonna really, if this was, if this was an actual structure,

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:57.100
you'll just literally drop something straight down from here,

00:03:57.100 --> 00:03:58.780
and that line is going to be perpendicular

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:01.740
to this base right over here, to AC.

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:05.380
And let me call that point, let me call that point D.

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:07.610
And what's useful here is now we've constructed,

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:11.610
we've turned that one triangle into two right triangles.

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:15.060
So we can say that the area, let me write it this way,

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:18.930
we can say the area of triangle ABC,

00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:20.290
that's what we wanna figure out.

00:04:20.329 --> 00:04:24.210
It's equal to the area of this character right here.

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:35.090
So it's equal to the area of triangle ABD + the area of triangle,

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:38.250
+ the area of this magenta triangle.

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:45.090
So, plus the area of BCD, of BCD.

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:46.280
And this is useful

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:48.320
because we know how to find the area of right triangles.

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:49.780
Now, obviously this is 90 degrees

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:51.010
and this is also going to be 90 degrees.

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:54.790
The area of ABD is ? base * height.

00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:59.680
So it's going to be ? * the base, which is the length AD.

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:05.550
So ? * AD, * the height, which is the length of BD right over here,

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:07.020
assuming that we can figure that out.

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:11.180
So this * that length, so, BD.

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:13.050
So that's the area of the blue triangle,

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:14.690
and I'll find the area of the magenta triangle.

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:16.770
Well, once again it's a right triangle.

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:19.130
It's gonna be ?, let me do that in magenta.

00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:20.900
Let me do that in magenta.

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:25.170
So it's going to be ? * the length of this base right over here,

00:05:25.170 --> 00:05:30.890
which is DC, the length of segment DC * the length of BD again.

00:05:30.890 --> 00:05:39.130
Now, you can factor out a ?, we can factor out a ? BD

00:05:39.130 --> 00:05:42.210
from both of these terms, ? BD.

00:05:42.230 --> 00:05:50.750
So you get ? BD * AD, we're left with AD,

00:05:50.750 --> 00:05:53.250
and that's not the same shade of blue.

00:05:53.250 --> 00:06:02.820
We're left with AD + DC.

00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:04.790
We close the parenthesis.

00:06:04.790 --> 00:06:06.810
And what is AD + DC?

00:06:06.810 --> 00:06:08.840
AD is the length, that length.

00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:10.420
And then DC is this length.

00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:13.190
So if you will add those two lengths, you get the length of AC.

00:06:13.190 --> 00:06:18.660
So this whole thing, this whole thing is the length AC.

00:06:18.660 --> 00:06:22.760
So, we're left with the area of ABC is equal to,

00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:26.320
I'll use in a new color, it's equal to ?,

00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:27.860
and I'll just switch the orders right over here.

00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:34.780
? *, which I'm gonna write in that same color, * AC * BD.

00:06:34.780 --> 00:06:38.730
Now, what is this again?

00:06:38.730 --> 00:06:43.420
Well, this is now ? * the base, which is this AC, * the height,

00:06:43.420 --> 00:06:44.210
which is BD.

00:06:44.210 --> 00:06:45.110
So that's pretty cool.

00:06:45.110 --> 00:06:46.600
It worked for right triangles, and it actually,

00:06:46.650 --> 00:06:48.230
if we know the height of a triangle.

00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:49.900
Now, this isn't one of the sides now.

00:06:49.930 --> 00:06:51.900
For a right triangle, it was one of the sides.

00:06:51.940 --> 00:06:53.700
Now, for this arbitrary triangle, it isn't.

00:06:53.740 --> 00:06:56.080
But if we know it, the area of this triangle

00:06:56.080 --> 00:06:59.530
is still ? * the base * the height.

00:06:59.560 --> 00:07:02.200
Now, what about a triangle like this?

00:07:02.200 --> 00:07:04.260
How can we figure out its area?

00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:06.270
Well, let's try doing the same thing.

00:07:06.300 --> 00:07:07.500
Let's see if we can somehow,

00:07:07.500 --> 00:07:10.190
either construct this out of right triangles,

00:07:10.190 --> 00:07:12.400
or maybe out a right triangle of this

00:07:12.460 --> 00:07:14.090
to make it into another right triangle.

00:07:14.090 --> 00:07:15.470
And the easiest way to do that is,

00:07:15.470 --> 00:07:18.090
we could kind of just drop a rock from right over there.

00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:21.210
And then this, and then where it kind of hits the ground

00:07:21.210 --> 00:07:22.270
would form a right angle.

00:07:22.330 --> 00:07:24.330
And let's call this point D.

00:07:24.350 --> 00:07:27.520
And what we care about, what we wanna find in this,

00:07:27.550 --> 00:07:29.290
what we wanna find the area of,

00:07:29.330 --> 00:07:32.210
we wanna find the area of triangle ABC.

00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:34.100
So that's what we care about.

00:07:34.120 --> 00:07:36.660
Triangle ABC is what we wanna find the area.

00:07:36.660 --> 00:07:40.280
But the area of triangle ABC is gonna be the area

00:07:40.280 --> 00:07:42.650
of this larger right triangle that we've set up.

00:07:42.680 --> 00:07:44.610
That's gonna be this larger triangle.

00:07:53.330 --> 00:07:57.330
Minus the area of this smaller one right over here.

00:07:57.330 --> 00:08:03.830
So, minus the area of ADC, of ADC.

00:08:03.830 --> 00:08:07.140
So I just, this blue one ADB, this is just the whole thing.

00:08:07.140 --> 00:08:11.500
This is the whole thing, just so we're clear of what we're talking about.

00:08:11.500 --> 00:08:13.800
Now, what is the area of ADB.

00:08:13.800 --> 00:08:16.310
Well, we know how to find the area of right triangles.

00:08:16.340 --> 00:08:24.130
ADB, the area of ADB is going to be, is going to be ? * our base,

00:08:24.130 --> 00:08:30.690
which is DB, the length of segment DB * our height,

00:08:30.690 --> 00:08:31.870
which is the length of AD.

00:08:31.920 --> 00:08:34.049
Times AD.

00:08:34.049 --> 00:08:37.480
And then from that we wanna subtract the area of the smaller triangle.

00:08:37.480 --> 00:08:42.299
So that's gonne be ? * our base, which is DC,

00:08:42.299 --> 00:08:46.730
that's the length of our base, DC, * the length of our height,

00:08:46.750 --> 00:08:49.060
which is AD, AD.

00:08:49.100 --> 00:08:53.790
So, here we can factor out a ?, and we can factor an AD.

00:08:53.790 --> 00:08:56.850
A ?, and an AD, so let's do that.

00:08:56.850 --> 00:08:59.330
So we factor out a ? * AD.

00:08:59.330 --> 00:09:05.980
And what's left inside is a DB - a DC.

00:09:11.690 --> 00:09:14.170
Let me put the parenthesis in a white again.

00:09:16.950 --> 00:09:20.380
Well, if you take the length, DB is the length of this whole thing.

00:09:20.380 --> 00:09:25.280
You subtract from that the length DC, you're gonna be left with CB.

00:09:25.280 --> 00:09:31.650
So this character right over here, this is C, this is CB.

00:09:31.650 --> 00:09:38.110
And so the area of ABC is going to be equal to ? * CB,

00:09:38.140 --> 00:09:42.050
I'm just switching the order of multiplication, with a yellow color.

00:09:42.090 --> 00:09:46.220
? * CB * AD

00:09:46.220 --> 00:09:49.140
Now, what is this?

00:09:49.170 --> 00:09:54.560
Once again, it's ? * our base * our height.

00:09:54.590 --> 00:09:56.130
And once again the height in this case,

00:09:56.190 --> 00:10:00.100
'cause it's not a right triangle, it's not one of the sides.

00:10:00.100 --> 00:10:02.230
Someone would have to give you that information.

00:10:02.260 --> 00:10:05.110
You'd have to figure out what this actual height is.

00:10:05.110 --> 00:10:06.700
But what's needed is,

00:10:06.700 --> 00:10:09.820
in any form of triangle the area is ? base * height.

00:10:09.820 --> 00:10:12.870
The height is, kind of, if you have the sides of a right triangle,

00:10:12.890 --> 00:10:14.700
it's easy to figure out.

00:10:14.700 --> 00:10:16.590
For these others, if it's not given,

00:10:16.610 --> 00:10:18.030
you might have to do it in some tricky way,
