00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:04.710
&gt;&gt; From the library of
Congress in Washington DC.

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:25.560
&gt;&gt; Georgette Dorn: Good
afternoon, I'm Georgette Dorn.

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:27.930 position:56%
I'm the Chief of the Hispanic
Division of the Library of Congress.

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:30.310
And I'm so pleased to
see so many people here

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:32.790
on such a terrible,
rainy and dark day.

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:35.940
So, welcome, welcome
to Hispanic month.

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:39.490 position:56%
I just wanted to tell you how
pleased I am to be talking to people

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:42.510
who have never been here before,
because I don't know your faces.

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:45.330
So, you must be from
Georgetown University, I assume?

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:48.510
No? Well, it's great to have you.

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:51.620
We do have the most wonderful
Hispanic collection anywhere

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:52.920
in the world.

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.250
Because we have books not only
published in Latin America,

00:00:55.250 --> 00:01:00.520
but also books about Latin
America, published in China, Japan,

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:02.440
Germany, all over the world.

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:05.560
So, for that reason, our
secondary book collection

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:09.730
and newspaper collection is,
there is no rival in the world.

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:14.790 position:56%
In addition, we have lots of
microfilms, newspapers, manuscripts,

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:19.510
printed photographs, and we have
about 8 million maps and atlases.

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:22.890
So, if you can find time,
please use our collection.

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:27.090
It's a great pleasure now
to introduce Christina Arce,

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:30.360
who is one of our users
of our collections.

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:34.420
She's a professor of Spanish
and Latin American literature,

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:38.400 position:56%
18 to 19 century, at the
University of Miami in Coral Gables.

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.970
She's a graduate of the University
of California at Berkeley,

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:46.800
PhD and a Masters from Middlebury
College, and undergrad degree

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:48.630
from Santa Barbara, California.

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:52.440
And she's the author of this
wonderful book, "Mexico Nobodies."

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:54.200
Which is going to be
on sale outside.

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:56.510
So, with that, Christina Arce.

00:01:56.510 --> 00:02:05.150
[ Applause ]

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:10.120 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Christina Arce: Wow, I guess I'd
like to know where everyone is from.

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:15.450
Because if Georgette, Ms. Dorn
doesn't know you, I'd like to know

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:20.060
where you hailed from on a rainy,
miserable day such as today.

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:21.360
The university?

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:24.680
I feel like maybe there's
a class here?

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:26.250
Really, just interest.

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:29.780
Wow. Well, this is
fantastic thank you so much.

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:32.010
And I'd like to thank
everybody for coming today.

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:33.360
This is such a pleasure.

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:35.190
And in particular Dr. Anna
Dini [assumed spelling]

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:37.260
and Katalina Gomez [assumed
spelling] for their initiative

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:39.800
in organizing today's event.

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:43.090
And especially to Georgette Dorn,
the Chief of the Hispanic Division

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:47.560 position:56%
for graciously supporting this event
as part of Hispanic Heritage Month

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:48.860
at the Library of Congress.

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:52.800
It's an honor for me to present
this book in this prestigious place

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:55.810
of learning that's dedicated to
the preservation of knowledge.

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:57.110
Eight million maps.

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:58.910
That's incredible.

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:03.360
I'm beholden to my colleagues
for engaging with my work.

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:04.660
Please have a seat.

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:05.960
Have a seat.

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:07.260
There's seats.

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:12.100 position:56%
And I think it's especially a
apropos, given that my book grapples

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:16.840
with the invisiblized
histories of women in Mexico.

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:21.350
So, I thought I would
tell you a little bit

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:25.700
about how I began this
project many, many years ago.

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:28.590
I was a first-year's master
student, political science,

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:32.090
and I took a course on
Mexican history just for fun.

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:33.520
As a Mexican-American, I wanted

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:36.690
to know a little bit more
about Mexican history.

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:38.650
And in the textbook,
that was assigned to us,

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:42.590
there was three-quarters of a
page dedicated to the soldadera,

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:45.880
the female camp followers
of the Mexican Revolution.

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:48.330
Intrigued, I searched
for more information

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:50.520
and when I asked my
father who they were.

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:54.310
He responded that they were
the wives of the soldiers.

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:57.730
And soon I realized that this
was a euphemistic way to refer

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:00.950 position:56%
to the women who appeared in all the
films I had watched with my family

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:03.930
on Sunday afternoons on one
of the few Spanish channels

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:05.960
in Los Angeles at the time.

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:11.120
This led me to consider who
were these women, these wives.

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:14.220
Can you hear me?

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:17.610
Okay. And why were they in
all the photographs and films

00:04:17.610 --> 00:04:21.740
of the Mexican Revolution, when not
even a page on them was included

00:04:21.740 --> 00:04:25.290
in an historical primer
of over 500 pages.

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:28.560
So, in the course of this informal
research on these women warriors,

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:31.510
I happened upon the only
novel dedicated entirely

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:36.140
to a female camp follower turned
colonel, Le Negra Angustias.

00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:38.100
And like most Mexicans at the time.

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:40.520
I too was unfamiliar
with the importance

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:43.280
of Afro descendants
to Mexican culture.

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:46.380 position:56%
And I found it striking that an
award-winning novel could be written

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:48.630 position:56%
about a black female [foreign word],

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:51.350
when Afro Mexicans are not
considered a relevant part

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:54.270
of Mexican culture, if at all.

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:59.330 position:56%
These paradoxes whereby the cultural
imaginary is saturated with images

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:03.510
of anonymous camp followers in
everything from photography, film,

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:07.650
art, and popular balladry;
including songs as popular as,

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:10.680
you perhaps know them, "La
Cucarracha" and "La Adelita."

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:14.330 position:56%
Yet, the real women in official
history are unknown is what inspired

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:15.630
this book.

00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:18.400
Thus, I explore how
individual people come

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:23.840
to embody larger conceptual
metaphors in Mexican history.

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:27.210
Such as how, for example, the
soldadera, as an occupation,

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:30.990 position:56%
came to represent the
overwhelming cultural panic provoked

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:34.540
by women bursting out of the
home and into the public sphere.

00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:37.610
And considered the role
that the arts played

00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:40.470
in understanding these people
and their contributions

00:05:40.470 --> 00:05:43.240
to Mexican culture and history.

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:48.650 position:56%
So, I'm going to start by
reflecting on the cover of the book.

00:05:48.650 --> 00:05:51.950
This photograph is of an
Afro Mexican [foreign word].

00:05:51.950 --> 00:05:54.420
Originally thought to be a
soldadera, from [foreign word].

00:05:54.420 --> 00:05:57.950
And it's one of the many
portraits attributed

00:05:57.950 --> 00:06:00.710
to the famous Mexican
photographer, Agustine Casasola,

00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:03.000
throughout the maelstrom
of the revolution.

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:06.940
Not surprisingly, this portrait
was showcased on the flyers

00:06:06.940 --> 00:06:09.850
for an exhibit titled, "The
African Presence in Mexico:

00:06:09.850 --> 00:06:11.630
From Yanga to the Present."

00:06:11.630 --> 00:06:14.810
Which opened at the Mexican Fine
Arts Museum in Chicago and traveled

00:06:14.810 --> 00:06:18.680
to San Antonia, Los Angeles,
Oakland, Washington DC,

00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:23.040
among other places,
between 2006 and 2011.

00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:27.250
Taken against an improvised rustic
white background, the first thing

00:06:27.250 --> 00:06:28.970
that arrests the viewer's eye,

00:06:28.970 --> 00:06:32.690
as with many portraits,
is the subject's gaze.

00:06:32.690 --> 00:06:35.160
This sitter is strong
and self-conscious.

00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:38.020
You'll notice her chin is lifted
with her head pointing slightly

00:06:38.020 --> 00:06:40.690
to the left, yet her gaze
looks straightforward.

00:06:40.690 --> 00:06:45.460
Piercing the congealing
materiality of the photograph.

00:06:45.460 --> 00:06:47.230
Perhaps, looking towards
where the photographer,

00:06:47.230 --> 00:06:50.820
supposedly Casasola,
may have been standing.

00:06:50.820 --> 00:06:53.970
Her gaze is imposing, and yet
the language of her body is

00:06:53.970 --> 00:06:56.230
as impressive as her gaze.

00:06:56.230 --> 00:06:58.440
Nonetheless, the comfortable
positioning

00:06:58.440 --> 00:07:01.060
of her body contradicts
the threat hinted

00:07:01.060 --> 00:07:04.750
at by the lower hand's proximity

00:07:04.750 --> 00:07:09.870
to the gun that's holstered
in her pants pocket.

00:07:09.870 --> 00:07:13.920
Oh, excuse me, revealing
the multiple codes signified

00:07:13.920 --> 00:07:17.530
by the term soldadera, which in
traditional parlance precludes

00:07:17.530 --> 00:07:20.380
military agency, but
often led directly to it,

00:07:20.380 --> 00:07:23.890
to call her a soldadera and
not a soldier, a soldada,

00:07:23.890 --> 00:07:26.740
deflects the military nature
of her position, and thus,

00:07:26.740 --> 00:07:28.040
she's technically demoted.

00:07:28.040 --> 00:07:33.040 position:56%
So often in the work studied in this
book, soldadera, as a word choice,

00:07:33.040 --> 00:07:37.400
which comes from the word soldada,
which actually means soldiers pay,

00:07:37.400 --> 00:07:40.810
not females, soldiers pay,
what they're paid with.

00:07:40.810 --> 00:07:44.780
Is exchanged for another more
dignified one, or in contrast,

00:07:44.780 --> 00:07:47.410
soldadera is often used an insult.

00:07:47.410 --> 00:07:51.420
This portrait is staged, but does
not follow the tradition typical

00:07:51.420 --> 00:07:53.140
of military heraldry,
such as [foreign word],

00:07:53.140 --> 00:07:56.460
the three-quarter positioning
of the head.

00:07:56.460 --> 00:07:59.510
But, the metals displayed on her
chest, and the strategic position

00:07:59.510 --> 00:08:02.940
of the gun, indicate that she
was a recognized military officer

00:08:02.940 --> 00:08:06.340
within the revolution army,
and not simply a wife,

00:08:06.340 --> 00:08:08.250
laundress, cook, or prostitute.

00:08:08.250 --> 00:08:10.630
Certainly, what's intriguing
about this portrait

00:08:10.630 --> 00:08:13.460
for the spectator is the fact
that she is both a soldadera

00:08:13.460 --> 00:08:16.660
and a soldier; male and female,
decorative but practical.

00:08:16.660 --> 00:08:18.100
And as a [foreign word]
black and white.

00:08:18.100 --> 00:08:22.110
When compared to the gallery
of photographic images

00:08:22.110 --> 00:08:23.410
that have been showcased

00:08:23.410 --> 00:08:26.930
of male soldiers during the
revolution, they're rarely Mexican.

00:08:26.930 --> 00:08:29.930
She is quite comfortable in the
traditional male realm of war,

00:08:29.930 --> 00:08:31.420
yet is not quite ready to give

00:08:31.420 --> 00:08:33.880
up that [foreign word]
of feminine aesthetic.

00:08:33.880 --> 00:08:38.270 position:56%
The ribbon adjoining her [foreign
word] and her earrings that are long

00:08:38.270 --> 00:08:40.880
and dangling create a
striking counterpoint

00:08:40.880 --> 00:08:43.570
to the gun she has not
removed from her pant pocket.

00:08:43.570 --> 00:08:45.290
Or maybe that is the point.

00:08:45.290 --> 00:08:47.210
Perhaps the viewer's
being instructed not

00:08:47.210 --> 00:08:51.300
to conflate the vestiges of
female attire with weakness.

00:08:51.300 --> 00:08:54.610
This woman seems to body the
contradictions of the war

00:08:54.610 --> 00:08:58.770
and the term soldadera in addition

00:08:58.770 --> 00:09:02.360
to the post-revolutionary
ideal of [foreign word].

00:09:02.360 --> 00:09:05.050
Considering how Mexican
blackness is figured

00:09:05.050 --> 00:09:09.050
into the marginalized experience of
the soldadera, add one more layer

00:09:09.050 --> 00:09:13.440 position:56%
to the soldadera's already
overblown and yet simplified legacy.

00:09:13.440 --> 00:09:17.140
The portrait of this real
woman now tenuously identified

00:09:17.140 --> 00:09:19.340
as Coronela Caremn Robles, from
[foreign word], from [foreign word]

00:09:19.340 --> 00:09:26.790
in 1914 has traveled the visual
imagery of Afro Mexican scholars.

00:09:26.790 --> 00:09:33.600 position:56%
But has only recently, and I mean
recently, recuperated a proper name.

00:09:33.600 --> 00:09:37.200
Alongside this excavated new
identity are only brief lines

00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:40.340
fragmentary and conclusive
and sometimes contradictory.

00:09:40.340 --> 00:09:42.290
Just last week I had
an anthropologist

00:09:42.290 --> 00:09:43.590
who saw the cover my book say,

00:09:43.590 --> 00:09:45.720
do you know for sure
that that's who that is?

00:09:45.720 --> 00:09:51.940
And I said, no, but that's
who they think the is.

00:09:51.940 --> 00:09:55.940
Inconclusive and contradictory
to fill in the gaps of her story.

00:09:55.940 --> 00:09:58.680
This portrait defies
a static iconicity

00:09:58.680 --> 00:10:00.080
that congeals and decontextualizes.

00:10:00.080 --> 00:10:03.600
And instead, points to another more
powerful knowledge, [foreign word],

00:10:03.600 --> 00:10:06.230
that has led to multiple
identifications

00:10:06.230 --> 00:10:08.910 position:56%
and a con commitment slippery truth.

00:10:08.910 --> 00:10:11.160
Women were in the background,
but also took fierce

00:10:11.160 --> 00:10:13.230
and strategic military rules.

00:10:13.230 --> 00:10:16.920
This image is testament to this
woman's misunderstood history,

00:10:16.920 --> 00:10:20.540
multiple names and elided
blackness and the fraught nature

00:10:20.540 --> 00:10:22.480
of Mexican womanhood in general.

00:10:22.480 --> 00:10:24.580
This nobody, like all the
other nobodies I discuss

00:10:24.580 --> 00:10:28.250
in my book is still looking at us
and is still claiming her place

00:10:28.250 --> 00:10:30.840
in the making of one of the most
important social revolutions

00:10:30.840 --> 00:10:33.220
of the 20th century.

00:10:33.220 --> 00:10:37.330
So, the first part of the book
"Entre Adelitas y Cucarachas:

00:10:37.330 --> 00:10:38.630
The Soldadera as Trope

00:10:38.630 --> 00:10:42.200
in the Mexican Revolution explores
the movement of the soldaderas

00:10:42.200 --> 00:10:45.790
and their peripatetic migrations
outside of the domestic domain

00:10:45.790 --> 00:10:49.880 position:56%
and into the public sphere, creating
what I call a mobile habitus,

00:10:49.880 --> 00:10:53.330
or as James Clifford has
theorized, a dwelling in travel.

00:10:53.330 --> 00:10:56.840
Soldaderas were crucial to
military success in Mexico.

00:10:56.840 --> 00:11:00.160
And regardless of whose side they
were on or what role they adopted,

00:11:00.160 --> 00:11:06.050
I contend that the term soldadera
etymologically ambiguous,

00:11:06.050 --> 00:11:09.390
becomes a word to describe
what was socially unacceptable.

00:11:09.390 --> 00:11:11.370
It's a way to debase the real worth

00:11:11.370 --> 00:11:14.490
of the militarily active
female participant of war,

00:11:14.490 --> 00:11:17.750
and a way to describe women
living outside the confines

00:11:17.750 --> 00:11:19.100
of traditional home.

00:11:19.100 --> 00:11:22.100
As soldaderas, they cannot
expect any remuneration

00:11:22.100 --> 00:11:23.900
or even recognition.

00:11:23.900 --> 00:11:28.950
By breaking, from what Diana Taylor
calls from traditional notions

00:11:28.950 --> 00:11:32.330
of female behavior, they
created what Diana Taylor calls a

00:11:32.330 --> 00:11:36.460
performative scenario on top of
the train, around the campfire,

00:11:36.460 --> 00:11:38.680
straggling behind the men.

00:11:38.680 --> 00:11:43.030
This scenario, which is repeatable
prosaic, yet multivalent,

00:11:43.030 --> 00:11:46.140
would brand their place
in the imaginary

00:11:46.140 --> 00:11:48.620 position:56%
of Mexicans for generations to come.

00:11:48.620 --> 00:11:51.730
The revolutionary practices
and tactics

00:11:51.730 --> 00:11:55.940
and divergent occupations
of place and space.

00:11:55.940 --> 00:11:59.530
So, the second chapter explores
the representation of these women

00:11:59.530 --> 00:12:02.550
in literary, visual
or cultural production

00:12:02.550 --> 00:12:05.300
by impacting the prevailing
tropes that originate

00:12:05.300 --> 00:12:08.320
in the [foreign word] the popular
ballads called "La Adelita"

00:12:08.320 --> 00:12:11.240
and "La Cucaracha" and I'm just
curious if you guys have heard,

00:12:11.240 --> 00:12:12.970
we've all heard "La
Cucaracha," sure?

00:12:12.970 --> 00:12:17.530
"La Adelita" is similar,
there have been even samba,

00:12:17.530 --> 00:12:21.620
rockabilly renditions
of "La Adelita," so,

00:12:21.620 --> 00:12:26.910
it's a very important
rhythm that operates

00:12:26.910 --> 00:12:30.180
in international circuits of music.

00:12:30.180 --> 00:12:33.510
So, this chapter considers how
the overwhelming visibility

00:12:33.510 --> 00:12:37.620
and shocking presence of the
soldadera forced popular balladeers

00:12:37.620 --> 00:12:41.330
to change the conventions
naturalize by narrative balladry.

00:12:41.330 --> 00:12:43.940
So, these [foreign word] are
not only recognized nationally

00:12:43.940 --> 00:12:47.890
but are internationally
emblems of Mexican folk music.

00:12:47.890 --> 00:12:51.050
And they operate as unofficial
anthems of the revolution.

00:12:51.050 --> 00:12:52.940
And come to represent the whole

00:12:52.940 --> 00:12:55.910
of female participation
in the revolution.

00:12:55.910 --> 00:12:59.340
But what's ironic of course is
as ballads, as popular ballads

00:12:59.340 --> 00:13:02.400
by folklorists, they were
not considered real examples

00:13:02.400 --> 00:13:06.870
of [foreign word], in part because
of their of the rhythm and the lack

00:13:06.870 --> 00:13:09.540
of a narrative story that there
were never real stories told

00:13:09.540 --> 00:13:15.340
about female soldiers, just sort
of abstracted ideals of womanhood.

00:13:15.340 --> 00:13:17.090
So, in chapter 3 of the first half

00:13:17.090 --> 00:13:21.000
of the book I discuss
more ambivalent,

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:24.770
even subversive soldadera
figures that twist the rigidity

00:13:24.770 --> 00:13:29.720 position:56%
of "La Cucaracha" who's the whore,
and "La Adelita" sort of the Barbie,

00:13:29.720 --> 00:13:32.880
the model, the sweetheart.

00:13:32.880 --> 00:13:37.090
That twists those stereotypes
into unheard-of forms

00:13:37.090 --> 00:13:40.030
that will constitute
new, albeit ephemeral,

00:13:40.030 --> 00:13:42.440
practices of Mexican womanhood.

00:13:42.440 --> 00:13:45.590
In the second part of the
book, so here we see examples

00:13:45.590 --> 00:13:49.610
of "La Adelita and "La Cucaracha."

00:13:49.610 --> 00:13:53.910
So, there's three popular
ballads there, excuse me.

00:13:59.620 --> 00:14:02.900
So, the second part of the book,
"The Blacks in the Closet,"

00:14:02.900 --> 00:14:05.450
unearths the legacy of
the African presence

00:14:05.450 --> 00:14:09.900 position:56%
in the Mexican cultural imaginary by
focusing on the figure of the mulata

00:14:09.900 --> 00:14:11.920
and Mexican music in the
form of [foreign word]

00:14:11.920 --> 00:14:13.220
and the provenance
of [foreign word].

00:14:13.220 --> 00:14:17.260
The mulata like the soldadera,

00:14:17.260 --> 00:14:20.350
lacks a proper name
and a place in society.

00:14:20.350 --> 00:14:23.930
Identified only through
the sexual congress

00:14:23.930 --> 00:14:28.200
of an anonymous black slave woman
and usually a Spanish father.

00:14:28.200 --> 00:14:32.060
But unlike the muddled masses that
define the image of the soldadera,

00:14:32.060 --> 00:14:34.450
mulatas marked their presence
through their emergence

00:14:34.450 --> 00:14:38.070
of singular exceptional figures
that are easily brushed aside

00:14:38.070 --> 00:14:40.850
by the populous as
curious anomalies.

00:14:40.850 --> 00:14:45.770
So, the fourth chapter critically
compares the coastal legend

00:14:45.770 --> 00:14:48.740
of the mulata, the [foreign word]

00:14:48.740 --> 00:14:52.720
with a real inquisition case that's
housed in the National Archives

00:14:52.720 --> 00:14:56.800
in Mexico City, of a runaway slave
named Antonia Desorta [assumed

00:14:56.800 --> 00:14:59.100
spelling] from Northern Mexico.

00:15:00.980 --> 00:15:03.760
And I observe how this
colonial legend of the mulata,

00:15:03.760 --> 00:15:05.470
the [foreign word], which
was eventually turned

00:15:05.470 --> 00:15:09.400
into a one-act opera, reflects a
whole mythology regarding black

00:15:09.400 --> 00:15:11.010
women in Mexico.

00:15:11.010 --> 00:15:14.650
They associate it with witch
craft, magic, unknown origins,

00:15:14.650 --> 00:15:18.570
or as a topicalized elsewhere
that infected the local populous

00:15:18.570 --> 00:15:23.060
with its hypersexualized
presence and then disappeared.

00:15:23.060 --> 00:15:25.890
So, these disappearing
acts will mark the legacy

00:15:25.890 --> 00:15:27.390
of all blacks in Mexico.

00:15:27.390 --> 00:15:30.570
There are glimmers, hints,
traces, and insinuations.

00:15:30.570 --> 00:15:32.740
But never claims about
their contributions

00:15:32.740 --> 00:15:34.050
to Mexican history and culture.

00:15:34.050 --> 00:15:38.110 position:56%
So, this chapter, in short, examines
how blacks were part-in-parcel

00:15:38.110 --> 00:15:42.090
of the nascent colonial regime and
culture, but were overrepresented

00:15:42.090 --> 00:15:47.180
in the Inquisition archives and in
the juridical language of heresy,

00:15:47.180 --> 00:15:49.170
witchcraft, and sexual dereliction.

00:15:49.170 --> 00:15:52.350
So, I follow-up my study
of the colonial period

00:15:52.350 --> 00:15:56.300
by examining the figure of the
mulata in Mexican films produced

00:15:56.300 --> 00:15:59.190
at the height of the
Mexican golden era cinema.

00:15:59.190 --> 00:16:03.000
And how they make an incipient
attempt to contend with the problem

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:05.920
of racism against Blacks in
Mexico through the tropes

00:16:05.920 --> 00:16:10.330
of Manny's tragic mulatas
imported from the US

00:16:10.330 --> 00:16:13.770
by representing blackness as
exceptional, or displacing it

00:16:13.770 --> 00:16:17.930 position:56%
onto the Caribbean, or abstracting
the positions of blacks into Mexico,

00:16:17.930 --> 00:16:21.570
in Mexico into a universal
dilemma of racism as a part

00:16:21.570 --> 00:16:23.210
of the legacy of slavery.

00:16:23.210 --> 00:16:26.830
These films reproduce,
I argue the very racism

00:16:26.830 --> 00:16:28.560
that the attempt to rectify.

00:16:28.560 --> 00:16:33.130
The second part of
the book concludes

00:16:33.130 --> 00:16:37.250
by discussing the audio tropic
and sonic landscape of Mexico

00:16:37.250 --> 00:16:39.340
that is a product of the
Afro [foreign word] culture

00:16:39.340 --> 00:16:40.640
of the Gold Coast.

00:16:40.640 --> 00:16:44.130
I contend that blackness
inserts itself into the fabric

00:16:44.130 --> 00:16:47.200
of the national narrative
through its most popular songs,

00:16:47.200 --> 00:16:48.910
[foreign word] and "La Bamba".

00:16:48.910 --> 00:16:51.300
We've all heard "La Bamba," no?

00:16:51.300 --> 00:16:55.680
So, such songs, and in particular
"La Bamba" are startling examples

00:16:55.680 --> 00:16:59.180
of how Mexico's nobodies are
the subjects and originators

00:16:59.180 --> 00:17:02.660
of a musical tradition that would
come to constitute the culture

00:17:02.660 --> 00:17:06.040
of a globalized Mexicanness.

00:17:06.040 --> 00:17:11.790
This chapter further discusses
the impact of Cuban music

00:17:11.790 --> 00:17:15.060
on Mexican cultural production
and identity by focusing

00:17:15.060 --> 00:17:18.280
on the exceptional figure,
Antonia Lanegra [assumed spelling],

00:17:18.280 --> 00:17:23.130
who is the matriarchal mulata who
was a national icon and performer

00:17:23.130 --> 00:17:26.890
of [foreign word], the favorite
music of the dance halls

00:17:26.890 --> 00:17:30.150
and brothels, and the Cuban
song from the Gulf Coast

00:17:30.150 --> 00:17:32.970
of Mexico, Veracruz, in particular.

00:17:32.970 --> 00:17:35.810
And it discusses how she
paradoxically constitutes the

00:17:35.810 --> 00:17:38.760
quintessence of Mexicanness
through her status

00:17:38.760 --> 00:17:42.980
as the model [foreign word],
despite her claim to blackness.

00:17:42.980 --> 00:17:45.960
So, she's as Mexican as they
come, despite being black.

00:17:45.960 --> 00:17:49.010
So, what do I mean by nobodies.

00:17:49.010 --> 00:17:52.920
What does it allow me to do?

00:17:52.920 --> 00:17:54.220
And I just want you to notice

00:17:54.220 --> 00:17:56.280
that in the image there,
that's Celia Cruz.

00:17:56.280 --> 00:18:00.060
So, there was a lot of interaction
between Caribbean and Cuba

00:18:00.060 --> 00:18:01.370
in particular in Veracruz.

00:18:01.370 --> 00:18:05.100
And so there's this way in
which blackness is displaced

00:18:05.100 --> 00:18:09.050
onto Caribbeanness, but
in particular Cubanness.

00:18:09.050 --> 00:18:11.890
So, what do I mean by nobodies,
and what does it allow me to do?

00:18:11.890 --> 00:18:15.290 position:56%
So, what this book seeks to discover
then, is the way this gendered

00:18:15.290 --> 00:18:18.440
and rationalized construct
is belied,

00:18:18.440 --> 00:18:21.630
undone through the very art
forms that perform this gendering

00:18:21.630 --> 00:18:25.380 position:56%
and racializing, and how these
pre-existing tropes are intertwined,

00:18:25.380 --> 00:18:28.900
reproduced, and yet
contain gaping fault lines.

00:18:28.900 --> 00:18:32.610
While womanhood and race
are invariably defined

00:18:32.610 --> 00:18:34.860
in concrete terms, the tremors

00:18:34.860 --> 00:18:39.690
that unsettle these constructs
are manifested by the fascination

00:18:39.690 --> 00:18:42.670
with which both elites
and peasants beheld

00:18:42.670 --> 00:18:45.320
and represented these
extraordinary people.

00:18:45.320 --> 00:18:48.850
Black, mulatto, white,
mestizo, and indigenous women.

00:18:48.850 --> 00:18:51.160
The cultural text examined
in this book ranging

00:18:51.160 --> 00:18:55.790
from as I mentioned [foreign word]
popular ballads, films to opera,

00:18:55.790 --> 00:19:00.270
witness the complex ways in which
traditional womanhood is defined

00:19:00.270 --> 00:19:04.830
by masculinists gestures and
disruptive by rationalizing ones.

00:19:04.830 --> 00:19:08.330
Indeed, the anxieties regarding
a hegemonic notion of race

00:19:08.330 --> 00:19:11.810
and gender are brought to task
with the figure of [foreign word].

00:19:11.810 --> 00:19:13.780
Her simultaneous masculine

00:19:13.780 --> 00:19:19.190 position:56%
and maternal heroism was an
embarrassment to military officials.

00:19:19.190 --> 00:19:22.030
While the mulata triangulates
native blackness

00:19:22.030 --> 00:19:25.430
with a foreign intrusion
and exotic sexuality.

00:19:25.430 --> 00:19:27.050
Providing a way to negotiate

00:19:27.050 --> 00:19:30.790
and explain unraveling sexual
[inaudible] in the countryside

00:19:30.790 --> 00:19:33.800
and the corruption
of while male desire.

00:19:33.800 --> 00:19:36.830
I argue that the figures
who populate the literary,

00:19:36.830 --> 00:19:39.940
visual and musical
imaginary constitute much more

00:19:39.940 --> 00:19:43.190
than base entertainment for
the masses or curious motif

00:19:43.190 --> 00:19:46.080
and cultural production
by patronizing elites.

00:19:46.080 --> 00:19:49.770
I argue that they reflect an almost
latent communal will to narrate

00:19:49.770 --> 00:19:52.870
that which the official
history often ignores.

00:19:52.870 --> 00:19:55.510
In the aesthetic, I claim
resides something more

00:19:55.510 --> 00:19:58.050
than artifice possibility.

00:19:58.050 --> 00:20:01.390
So, I propose nobodies
as an alternative

00:20:01.390 --> 00:20:05.040
to understanding this fundamental
historical marginalization.

00:20:05.040 --> 00:20:08.590
And it's over representation
in the arts.

00:20:08.590 --> 00:20:13.630
As I've claimed, neither gender nor
race's critical categories can be

00:20:13.630 --> 00:20:15.600
engaged independently.

00:20:15.600 --> 00:20:18.950
Mexican nationalist discourse
and art, grapple specifically

00:20:18.950 --> 00:20:22.450
with the tangled strands of both.

00:20:22.450 --> 00:20:25.790
In contrast to this nominal
abstraction, the body

00:20:25.790 --> 00:20:29.060
and nobody directly
points to the very real

00:20:29.060 --> 00:20:31.660
and concrete place they
have in the background.

00:20:31.660 --> 00:20:34.520
The spaces they occupy, the
contributions they make,

00:20:34.520 --> 00:20:37.840
and the violence inflicted
upon the flesh.

00:20:37.840 --> 00:20:40.750
Their nobody-ness is clearly
a product of their othering,

00:20:40.750 --> 00:20:43.550
but also the practical and
strategic disappearing of them

00:20:43.550 --> 00:20:45.690
by Mexican natural discourse.

00:20:45.690 --> 00:20:50.590
Through the denial of a proper
name, cucaracha, adelita,

00:20:50.590 --> 00:20:54.030
as well as the regulation
of their bodies.

00:20:54.030 --> 00:20:56.610
This disappearing, however,
happened in different ways.

00:20:56.610 --> 00:20:59.210
On the one hand, the
overrepresentation of the soldadero

00:20:59.210 --> 00:21:02.450
in the crafting of a
post-revolutionary identity,

00:21:02.450 --> 00:21:06.070
blinds the spectator or
reader through excess.

00:21:06.070 --> 00:21:08.480
While on the other, the
absolute elision of blacks

00:21:08.480 --> 00:21:11.200
from the Mexican historical
consciousness,

00:21:11.200 --> 00:21:15.440
makes the striking figure of
the mulata exotic and foreign.

00:21:15.440 --> 00:21:19.780
So, the promulgation of a
vacuous revolutionary rhetoric

00:21:19.780 --> 00:21:22.680
that serves only the
authoritarian elites in the name

00:21:22.680 --> 00:21:24.930
of murdered peasant icons
such as Poncho Villa,

00:21:24.930 --> 00:21:29.160
and Emiliano Zapata featured
in this very famous image,

00:21:29.160 --> 00:21:33.020
"Villa en la silla presidencial"
in the presidential seat,

00:21:33.020 --> 00:21:37.920
or local movements celebrated on
the world stage, that have not,

00:21:37.920 --> 00:21:40.840
in the case [foreign word], put
[foreign word], indigenous law

00:21:40.840 --> 00:21:44.080
into place nor in the case
of [foreign word] today,

00:21:44.080 --> 00:21:45.500
brought justice to the families

00:21:45.500 --> 00:21:48.680
of the 43 disappeared
students a few years ago,

00:21:48.680 --> 00:21:53.000
or even allowed Afro Mexicans to be
recognized as viable communities,

00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:56.260
is testament to the reality that
Mexico is now more than ever,

00:21:56.260 --> 00:21:59.940
an authoritarian state and that
the road towards democracy is

00:21:59.940 --> 00:22:01.280
still long.

00:22:01.280 --> 00:22:03.450
However, as argued
by Gareth Williams

00:22:03.450 --> 00:22:07.570
and myself art registers
the profound necessary

00:22:07.570 --> 00:22:12.270
and inevitable moments that allow
us to think and be otherwise.

00:22:12.270 --> 00:22:15.760
The majestic effect
of this one portrait,

00:22:15.760 --> 00:22:19.250
the once nameless Afro Mexican
soldadera staring intently

00:22:19.250 --> 00:22:22.110
so that I was staring intently
into the camera with her gun

00:22:22.110 --> 00:22:23.910
in her pocket, her military
pins, her [foreign word] hat

00:22:23.910 --> 00:22:28.690 position:56%
and dangling earrings defies the
static, post-revolutionary narrative

00:22:28.690 --> 00:22:32.700
of abnegated womanhood and
melancholic [foreign word].

00:22:32.700 --> 00:22:36.380
This woman alone through the
multiple ambivalences communicated

00:22:36.380 --> 00:22:39.180
in the portrait, and its
contradictory captions.

00:22:39.180 --> 00:22:42.130
In all versions that I read,
there were probably at least four

00:22:42.130 --> 00:22:45.570
or five different captions
of who this person was.

00:22:45.570 --> 00:22:47.800
Speaks of all the different
ways of being

00:22:47.800 --> 00:22:50.350
and becoming a post-revolutionary
woman in Mexico.

00:22:50.350 --> 00:22:54.330
The [foreign word], the popular
ballad bears witness to this.

00:22:54.330 --> 00:22:57.160
Heralding war heroes
and manly valor,

00:22:57.160 --> 00:23:01.920 position:56%
it also did not ignore its women, if
only to present them as cockroaches

00:23:01.920 --> 00:23:04.540
or Barbies; cucaracha and adelitas.

00:23:04.540 --> 00:23:09.390
So, this permits the disfiguring
nature of cultural production

00:23:09.390 --> 00:23:13.070
to simultaneously reveal other
possibilities beyond degenerate

00:23:13.070 --> 00:23:15.420
cucarachas or beguiling adelitas.

00:23:15.420 --> 00:23:18.620
To imagine the real people
who flitted in the background

00:23:18.620 --> 00:23:19.920
as playing an integral role

00:23:19.920 --> 00:23:23.400
in what is today Mexican
culture, history and politics.

00:23:23.400 --> 00:23:25.920
So, before I conclude, I just
wanted to mention that the image

00:23:25.920 --> 00:23:29.100
in the middle is, we've
just recently discovered,

00:23:29.100 --> 00:23:31.330
the same [foreign word]
that's been on the cover,

00:23:31.330 --> 00:23:32.630
is on the cover of my book.

00:23:32.630 --> 00:23:37.250
It's not positively
identified, but Mexican scholar,

00:23:37.250 --> 00:23:39.080
John Raz [assumed spelling]
has been able to make a link

00:23:39.080 --> 00:23:41.420
between this image, who was also

00:23:41.420 --> 00:23:43.340
in the archive identified
as a soldadera.

00:23:43.340 --> 00:23:46.010
It's clear she's not a soldadera,
she's in the middle, right?

00:23:46.010 --> 00:23:47.550
But it was identified as soldadera.

00:23:47.550 --> 00:23:51.180
Now, she's identified as
Coronela Caremn Robles.

00:23:51.180 --> 00:23:55.340
As I was finishing the book,
I still had to figure out.

00:23:55.340 --> 00:23:57.260
I went through all the
different copies, and I realized

00:23:57.260 --> 00:24:00.100
that this was the same person.

00:24:00.100 --> 00:24:03.590
So, I'd like to conclude
with a few words

00:24:03.590 --> 00:24:06.880
from my conclusion to be otherwise.

00:24:09.220 --> 00:24:16.240
Okay. From May until August
2015, the Vincent Price Museum

00:24:16.240 --> 00:24:20.140
in east Los Angeles hosted a suburb
exhibition titled "Soldadera"

00:24:20.140 --> 00:24:21.840
By internationally
renowned performance

00:24:21.840 --> 00:24:24.620
and video artist Nao Bustamante.

00:24:24.620 --> 00:24:26.920
The multimedia exhibition imagined

00:24:26.920 --> 00:24:30.970
through what the Chicana artist
calls a speculative reenactment.

00:24:30.970 --> 00:24:34.160
The soldadera's participation
in the Mexican revolution.

00:24:34.160 --> 00:24:37.130
Thoroughly mesmerizing,
haunting and dreamlike.

00:24:37.130 --> 00:24:40.320
At the same time, it's
tactile, concrete and physical.

00:24:40.320 --> 00:24:44.300
The exhibition features several
pieces that mix archival footage

00:24:44.300 --> 00:24:48.540
and photography, such as the
images I just showed you,

00:24:48.540 --> 00:24:51.520
with Bustamante's revisionary
and majestic work

00:24:51.520 --> 00:24:53.960
and material craft
blurring the boundaries

00:24:53.960 --> 00:24:55.800
between archive and invention.

00:24:55.800 --> 00:24:58.410
And rending at the same time,

00:24:58.410 --> 00:25:02.000
it weaves these women's stories
tightly together through the symbol

00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:05.590
of a yellow, bullet-hugging Kevlar
[inaudible] dress, that's featured

00:25:05.590 --> 00:25:08.100
in the middle of the image.

00:25:08.100 --> 00:25:09.490
Filling the exhibition hall,

00:25:09.490 --> 00:25:12.300
the cinematic installation
was a five-minute loop.

00:25:12.300 --> 00:25:17.740
You see that in the far left
corner, was a cinematic loop;

00:25:17.740 --> 00:25:23.450
five-minute loop of a mostly black

00:25:23.450 --> 00:25:27.100
and white film projected
onto a 16 x 9 screen.

00:25:27.100 --> 00:25:29.470
The video transposed reenactments

00:25:29.470 --> 00:25:33.200
of soldaderas wearing
Bustamante's yellow Kevlar dresses,

00:25:33.200 --> 00:25:37.820
onto archival footage, in order to
create what Bustamante's rendition

00:25:37.820 --> 00:25:44.370
of the unfinished chapter dedicated
to the Soldadera from the film

00:25:44.370 --> 00:25:49.490
"Que Viva Mexico" by the Russian
filmmaker, Sergei Eisentein.

00:25:49.490 --> 00:25:52.830
Unfortunately, he was unable to
complete it because the project ran

00:25:52.830 --> 00:25:55.360
out of money, and he was forced
to leave Mexico before production

00:25:55.360 --> 00:25:57.210
on this segment could begin.

00:25:57.210 --> 00:25:59.230
So, the soldadera's important role

00:25:59.230 --> 00:26:01.640
in the revolution was
first visually imagined

00:26:01.640 --> 00:26:06.400 position:56%
by an avant-garde Russian filmmaker,
only to be completed 86 years later

00:26:06.400 --> 00:26:09.280
by Chicana performance artists
from the San Joaquin Valley.

00:26:09.280 --> 00:26:10.830
Both outsiders.

00:26:10.830 --> 00:26:15.040
At the center of the room
in this exhibit was a series

00:26:15.040 --> 00:26:17.890
of yellow dresses, bulky and
perceived thoroughly unfit

00:26:17.890 --> 00:26:19.700
for the battleground of war.

00:26:19.700 --> 00:26:24.770
The dresses, titled "[Foreign
Word] Kevlar" 2945 are crafted

00:26:24.770 --> 00:26:28.530
as bulletproof gowns that would
withstand the piercing gunshots

00:26:28.530 --> 00:26:31.590
of the Winchester 3030
rifle, the preferred weapon

00:26:31.590 --> 00:26:34.050
of the revolutionary insurgents.

00:26:34.050 --> 00:26:38.120
Kevlar design by a female chemist,
is a synthetic material woven

00:26:38.120 --> 00:26:41.860
so tightly that it is five
times stronger than steel.

00:26:41.860 --> 00:26:45.560
However, after a single
penetration, it begins to unravel.

00:26:45.560 --> 00:26:47.880 position:56%
Body Armor the soldaderas never had,

00:26:47.880 --> 00:26:50.990
if only the real [inaudible] could
have been lined with this stuff.

00:26:50.990 --> 00:26:53.100
It is a speculative
tribute to the thousands

00:26:53.100 --> 00:26:55.950
of nameless denigrated women who
were killed on the battlefield,

00:26:55.950 --> 00:26:58.890
raped, or maimed and
left and recognized.

00:26:58.890 --> 00:27:01.970
In the words of Hannah Manchel
[assumed spelling], and I quote,

00:27:01.970 --> 00:27:04.740
"Now Bustamante's Kevlar
dresses are, in a way,

00:27:04.740 --> 00:27:07.240
garments protected by unraveling.

00:27:07.240 --> 00:27:09.550
The dresses perform a
kind of vulnerability

00:27:09.550 --> 00:27:11.670
about thinness and thickness.

00:27:11.670 --> 00:27:16.080
A kind of vulnerability that cannot
go to pieces, when hit by a bullet

00:27:16.080 --> 00:27:19.400
or when cut by an artist's
scissors, the fabric was thin,

00:27:19.400 --> 00:27:21.330
unravels to protect
the body inside."

00:27:21.330 --> 00:27:24.810
The display includes
several of the dresses,

00:27:24.810 --> 00:27:27.320
but only one lives in a glass box.

00:27:27.320 --> 00:27:28.670
The one we see here.

00:27:28.670 --> 00:27:30.880
A sleeping beauty,
pierced with the slugs

00:27:30.880 --> 00:27:33.450
of an original Winchester 3030.

00:27:33.450 --> 00:27:36.090
The remaining dresses will
also eventually be fired on

00:27:36.090 --> 00:27:40.430
and in this way, it is an ongoing
performance that will continue

00:27:40.430 --> 00:27:44.210
to record and violate the
imagined and invented bodies

00:27:44.210 --> 00:27:45.510
of these invisible women.

00:27:45.510 --> 00:27:48.700
Phantasmagoric violence
that continues to pierce,

00:27:48.700 --> 00:27:53.280
that withstands time and it's
punctuating deformations, ephemeral

00:27:53.280 --> 00:27:57.660
and yet ineluctably felt.

00:27:57.660 --> 00:28:02.060 position:56%
Hidden at the back of the exhibition
hall is an understated piece called

00:28:02.060 --> 00:28:03.360
the "Chac Mool."

00:28:03.360 --> 00:28:06.030
Perhaps the most complex component

00:28:06.030 --> 00:28:08.650
of the entire "Soldadera"
exhibition.

00:28:08.650 --> 00:28:11.690
It is a remake of a
Mesoamerican statute

00:28:11.690 --> 00:28:17.980
that features a reclining figure
whose head faces forward 90 degrees

00:28:17.980 --> 00:28:21.820
and whose abdomen usually houses
a bowl for sacrificial items.

00:28:21.820 --> 00:28:26.820 position:56%
And is often associated with Tlaloc,
the Aztec God of rain and fertility.

00:28:26.820 --> 00:28:31.430
An almost incredible reenactment
to see it, the spectator's forced

00:28:31.430 --> 00:28:35.670 position:56%
to pierce through the anti-view
finder we saw in the previous image,

00:28:35.670 --> 00:28:40.590
whose circular form remind us
of Tlaloc's prominent eyes.

00:28:40.590 --> 00:28:43.860
In order to observe a small
screen that loops 12 minutes

00:28:43.860 --> 00:28:49.650
of Becerra Lumbreras on her bed,
the woman featured on the screen,

00:28:49.650 --> 00:28:51.710 position:56%
the oldest person alive at the time.

00:28:51.710 --> 00:28:53.930
Although Guinness refuses
to put her in the record

00:28:53.930 --> 00:28:56.470
because she lost her birth
certificate 40 years prior.

00:28:56.470 --> 00:29:00.610
And the last surviving soldadera
of the Mexican Revolution.

00:29:00.610 --> 00:29:06.890
At 127 years of age, she
reclined on her perch of pillows

00:29:06.890 --> 00:29:08.760
on a makeshift bed, a
living [foreign word],

00:29:08.760 --> 00:29:14.860 position:56%
who a month after her encounter with
Bustamante was to leave the earth,

00:29:14.860 --> 00:29:18.070
having outlived all of her children
and many of her grandchildren.

00:29:18.070 --> 00:29:21.290
She finally told her story
through the persistent tapping

00:29:21.290 --> 00:29:23.590
of an unknown rhythm
in the video loop.

00:29:23.590 --> 00:29:26.790
Her communicatory gesture revealing
her engagement with the revolution

00:29:26.790 --> 00:29:29.860
for the first time in public,
and for the last time in private,

00:29:29.860 --> 00:29:32.700
the to team that Bustamante
gathered in their quest

00:29:32.700 --> 00:29:34.000
to meet the last living Soldadera.

00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:35.500
I want to explain that.

00:29:35.500 --> 00:29:39.890
She couldn't speak anymore, so
she just tapped in the video loop.

00:29:39.890 --> 00:29:49.270
It took over 100 years, she waited
patiently, but her body spoke.

00:29:49.270 --> 00:29:52.730
And she was heard.

00:29:52.730 --> 00:29:56.440
A Moises Medina who accompanied
Bustamante's crew attest that,

00:29:56.440 --> 00:30:00.370
and I quote, "Very little was
vocalized, but much was said."

00:30:00.370 --> 00:30:04.440
Becerra Lumbreras was
one of the few who fought

00:30:04.440 --> 00:30:07.740
for her communal land grant, and
withstood the chiding of others,

00:30:07.740 --> 00:30:11.250
as she demanded her revolutionary
pension and I quote, "Vocally,

00:30:11.250 --> 00:30:13.580
insisting that she had bled,
fought, and mothered children

00:30:13.580 --> 00:30:15.040
of the of the revolution."

00:30:15.040 --> 00:30:19.190
The cleverness of this installation
is the paradoxical analogy

00:30:19.190 --> 00:30:22.770
that Bustamante draws between
Lumbreras and the [foreign word].

00:30:22.770 --> 00:30:26.020
A Mesoamerican statute whose
role is not understood.

00:30:26.020 --> 00:30:30.150
Who lays in an almost semi-supine
position, except that it rest

00:30:30.150 --> 00:30:34.950
on its forearms, reclined,
vulnerable, and yet active.

00:30:34.950 --> 00:30:38.230
Located outside of the sacred
temples, but not part of them.

00:30:38.230 --> 00:30:41.070
Spread throughout the diverse
indigenous world across time

00:30:41.070 --> 00:30:45.760 position:56%
and space associated with fertility,
but upon whose belly rested the ball

00:30:45.760 --> 00:30:47.800
for the sacrificial victims,

00:30:47.800 --> 00:30:50.940
or reverential items,
no one knows for sure.

00:30:50.940 --> 00:30:54.510
An icon that was misnamed by
the person who discovered it.

00:30:54.510 --> 00:30:57.330
Not unlike the soldadera,
the name stuck.

00:30:57.330 --> 00:30:58.730
Jennifer Doyle, the curator

00:30:58.730 --> 00:31:01.530
of the exhibition explains
the work in a quote.

00:31:01.530 --> 00:31:04.700
"Our intention as artist and
curator is to invite the viewer

00:31:04.700 --> 00:31:08.530
of the exhibition to consider the
possibilities of the speculative,

00:31:08.530 --> 00:31:12.160
even utopian thinking as not a
retreat from the here and now.

00:31:12.160 --> 00:31:15.210
But as a deep engagement of
how we might imagine the here

00:31:15.210 --> 00:31:16.580
and now, differently."

00:31:16.580 --> 00:31:21.900
The women in my book
may have frayed stories,

00:31:21.900 --> 00:31:24.930
occupy semi-supine
positions, hover in the shadows

00:31:24.930 --> 00:31:29.480
between maternal instinct and macho
valor, blackness and whiteness,

00:31:29.480 --> 00:31:31.710
respectability and audacity.

00:31:31.710 --> 00:31:33.950
But like Becerra Lumbreras
have outlived

00:31:33.950 --> 00:31:37.190
and questioned their very objection
in the art that they've inspired

00:31:37.190 --> 00:31:40.680
and the stories that are told
or tapped with their fingers,

00:31:40.680 --> 00:31:42.370
and in the case of
Becerra Lumbraras,

00:31:42.370 --> 00:31:47.550
in the very life she refused to
leave behind as super centenarian.

00:31:47.550 --> 00:31:49.910
This Pueblo is not monolithic.

00:31:49.910 --> 00:31:53.620 position:56%
Indeed, it's composed of all
different kinds of people, lifeways,

00:31:53.620 --> 00:31:56.180
histories, bodies,
and [foreign word].

00:31:56.180 --> 00:32:00.380 position:56%
The practice of daily life, the
organic mixture of quotidian ritual,

00:32:00.380 --> 00:32:04.560
and the praxis of culture, even in
the midst of its creation points

00:32:04.560 --> 00:32:06.390
to the constant revolutions
that happen

00:32:06.390 --> 00:32:10.230
when diverse people come together
in the wake of violent events.

00:32:10.230 --> 00:32:14.300
Whether these events are slavery,
invasions, revolts against tyranny,

00:32:14.300 --> 00:32:18.890
spiritual violence, the unjust
appropriation of ancestral land,

00:32:18.890 --> 00:32:22.460
or gender aggression the
practice of living these events,

00:32:22.460 --> 00:32:26.770
of living rupture and continuity
generates a sense of pueblo,

00:32:26.770 --> 00:32:30.000
even when the pueblo itself
is far from homogeneous.

00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:32.640
Art and popular culture
can intervene,

00:32:32.640 --> 00:32:35.830
although not always evenly,
when history leaves off.

00:32:35.830 --> 00:32:39.510
At least this has been the
case with Mexico's nobody's.

00:32:39.510 --> 00:32:42.510
Thank you so much for listening.

00:32:42.510 --> 00:32:52.160
[ Applause ]

00:32:52.160 --> 00:32:55.270
I'm happy to entertain
any questions.

00:32:55.270 --> 00:33:00.040 position:56%
And again, thank you all for being
here, this is the thrill of my life.

00:33:00.040 --> 00:33:01.670
Ten years of work, yes?

00:33:01.670 --> 00:33:05.180
May I ask you to identify yourself,
so I know who I'm talking to.

00:33:05.180 --> 00:33:06.480
&gt;&gt; Dene Barr:

00:33:06.480 --> 00:33:07.780
&gt;&gt; Dene Barr [assumed spelling].

00:33:07.780 --> 00:33:09.080
I'm a researcher in the
Hispanic Division here

00:33:09.080 --> 00:33:10.380
at the Library of Congress.

00:33:10.380 --> 00:33:14.190 position:56%
I study filmmaking, first of all, at
University of Maryland College Park.

00:33:14.190 --> 00:33:18.040
Eisentein, when I hear Eisentein, I
need to know the name of that film,

00:33:18.040 --> 00:33:20.470
I'd like to see that film.

00:33:20.470 --> 00:33:21.770
&gt;&gt; Christina Arce:
"Que Viva Mexico."

00:33:21.770 --> 00:33:27.200
It is one of the first films made
about the Mexican revolution.

00:33:27.200 --> 00:33:31.860
He had designed it with a
segment of the soldadera in mind.

00:33:31.860 --> 00:33:34.370
But he got ran out of Mexico
because what he was doing.

00:33:34.370 --> 00:33:36.810
It's sort of like; oh, I'm sorry.

00:33:36.810 --> 00:33:43.320
It's very sort of revolutionary
documentary form.

00:33:43.320 --> 00:33:46.830
And so, this is one of
the most famous pieces.

00:33:46.830 --> 00:33:49.780
And of course, you know, Mexicans
look at it as Mexican art,

00:33:49.780 --> 00:33:53.080
but it was made by a
Russian filmmaker in Russian.

00:33:53.080 --> 00:33:56.300 position:56%
So, yeah, it's available on YouTube.

00:33:56.300 --> 00:33:59.400
You can see it on YouTube
but the quality's not good.

00:33:59.400 --> 00:34:04.220
And because of the visual
imagery and the different; yes?

00:34:04.220 --> 00:34:06.260
May I know who you are?

00:34:06.260 --> 00:34:07.560
&gt;&gt; Eve Ferguson: My name is Eve
Ferguson [assumed spelling],

00:34:07.560 --> 00:34:10.230
I work in the African Section

00:34:10.230 --> 00:34:13.250
at the Middle Eastern
division her at the library.

00:34:13.250 --> 00:34:16.200
And so, my question is,
like contemporary artists,

00:34:16.200 --> 00:34:20.800
like Lila Downs is now shining
a light on Afro Mexican music.

00:34:20.800 --> 00:34:27.200
Is there a greater acceptance in
Mexican society, the contributions

00:34:27.200 --> 00:34:31.410
of Afro Mexicans now
than previously.

00:34:31.410 --> 00:34:33.300
&gt;&gt; Christina Arce: That
is a spectacular question.

00:34:33.300 --> 00:34:35.690
And there's a greater awareness,

00:34:35.690 --> 00:34:38.210
I don't know if there's
a greater acceptance.

00:34:38.210 --> 00:34:39.730
They're still not recognized.

00:34:39.730 --> 00:34:45.250
There was; among scholars there is.

00:34:45.250 --> 00:34:47.600
There's a whole field
of Afro Mexican studies.

00:34:47.600 --> 00:34:50.040
And there's Mexican scholars and
there are North American scholars

00:34:50.040 --> 00:34:52.250
who have sort of in
tandem engaged in both.

00:34:52.250 --> 00:34:54.560
Sometimes at odds with each other.

00:34:54.560 --> 00:34:59.390
But, yes. I mean there's definitely
a much broader recognition.

00:34:59.390 --> 00:35:01.880
Oh, yes, yes, we did have some
blacks but they were, you know,

00:35:01.880 --> 00:35:03.580
at the beginning of
the colonial period.

00:35:03.580 --> 00:35:07.550 position:56%
So, there's a way in which it's
sort of you know it was so long ago.

00:35:07.550 --> 00:35:11.380
And after [foreign word],
there's this lack of recognition

00:35:11.380 --> 00:35:13.230
for individual populations
and communities

00:35:13.230 --> 00:35:17.480
that in fact still have
vibrant Afro Mexican cultures,

00:35:17.480 --> 00:35:20.300
for example, in the costas.

00:35:20.300 --> 00:35:22.580
There's a way in which they
relegate it to coastal culture,

00:35:22.580 --> 00:35:26.830
but they were part of the
intricate part of the construction

00:35:26.830 --> 00:35:29.310
of Mexican culture
throughout the colonial period,

00:35:29.310 --> 00:35:31.330
because they weren't just
relegated to the coast,

00:35:31.330 --> 00:35:33.200
they were in fact in
the mining centers.

00:35:33.200 --> 00:35:35.060
That's where the slaves were,
they worked in the mines.

00:35:35.060 --> 00:35:38.640
And so, the particular case that
I look at is not the gulf coast

00:35:38.640 --> 00:35:41.490
of Veracruz, where there
is a general acceptance

00:35:41.490 --> 00:35:44.670
of blackness there, or even the
Pacific coast where there were oh,

00:35:44.670 --> 00:35:47.190
yeah, you know Cimarron
Maroon colonies.

00:35:47.190 --> 00:35:49.480
No, they more than [inaudible]
colonies, they were part

00:35:49.480 --> 00:35:51.290
of the mining communities
and so the [foreign word],

00:35:51.290 --> 00:35:54.490
or the women who made the chocolate
were almost always Afro Mexican.

00:35:54.490 --> 00:35:56.500
There was a link between the two.

00:35:56.500 --> 00:36:00.310
So, the general population is mixed
in terms of how they accept it.

00:36:00.310 --> 00:36:04.190
Even the scholars will say that
chicanos and chicanas in particular

00:36:04.190 --> 00:36:07.100
over determined the
blackness of Mexican culture.

00:36:07.100 --> 00:36:09.860
Well you know, they exaggerate it.

00:36:09.860 --> 00:36:11.160
Still to this day.

00:36:11.160 --> 00:36:14.140
I mean, I go; I've been to
two conferences last year,

00:36:14.140 --> 00:36:17.500
where I presented some material,
and as chicana, they looked at me

00:36:17.500 --> 00:36:20.290
like well, you know, you guys
are over exaggerating it.

00:36:20.290 --> 00:36:23.440
That's part of the North American
Academy, and sort of the discourse

00:36:23.440 --> 00:36:28.650
of identity politic that's
permeated Afro diasporic studies.

00:36:28.650 --> 00:36:30.490
So, it's mixed.

00:36:30.490 --> 00:36:31.790
Yes?

00:36:31.790 --> 00:36:34.940
&gt;&gt; John Taupping: Yeah, my name is
John Taupping [assumed spelling],

00:36:34.940 --> 00:36:36.850 position:56%
I'm a cataloger here at the library.

00:36:36.850 --> 00:36:40.580
Is there a distinction
in Mexican Spanish

00:36:40.580 --> 00:36:43.410
between la negra and la mulata?

00:36:43.410 --> 00:36:45.450
There was that famous
singer named la Negra,

00:36:45.450 --> 00:36:48.890
but I think normally you
were, typically you referred

00:36:48.890 --> 00:36:53.770
to Afro Mexican women as mulata,

00:36:53.770 --> 00:36:55.530
is there a distinction
between the two terms?

00:36:55.530 --> 00:36:58.700
&gt;&gt; Christina Arce: No,
that's a great question.

00:36:58.700 --> 00:37:01.300
Because it has to do
with the naming.

00:37:01.300 --> 00:37:07.360
So, it was very popular among
Caribbean musicians in particular

00:37:07.360 --> 00:37:11.580
to be identified through that
sort of nominal blackness.

00:37:11.580 --> 00:37:17.560
So, for example, her
nephew took on el negro too,

00:37:17.560 --> 00:37:19.520
[foreign word], or
something like that.

00:37:19.520 --> 00:37:22.170
And so, that's a way to over
accentuate the blackness,

00:37:22.170 --> 00:37:27.190
which then appealed to the sort
of tropicalizing discourse of oh,

00:37:27.190 --> 00:37:29.410
you know she is la negra,
when in fact she's a mulata.

00:37:29.410 --> 00:37:30.710
So, yeah, there is.

00:37:30.710 --> 00:37:32.010
That's the etymological difference.

00:37:32.010 --> 00:37:34.420
I mean, mulata is part
of the racial taxonomies

00:37:34.420 --> 00:37:36.970
that were part of the
colonial period.

00:37:36.970 --> 00:37:39.240
I mean I'm not sure
everyone knows the paintings,

00:37:39.240 --> 00:37:41.860
the [foreign word] paintings
throughout the colonial period.

00:37:41.860 --> 00:37:43.160
Are we familiar with those?

00:37:43.160 --> 00:37:47.040
Where all the different racial
taxonomies were epitomized

00:37:47.040 --> 00:37:50.380
through these portraiture,
which then became.

00:37:50.380 --> 00:37:53.720
You know, many of those, there was
only five, six, maybe half a dozen

00:37:53.720 --> 00:37:57.240
that were regularly used, mulata
being one of the principal ones.

00:37:57.240 --> 00:38:02.220
But in terms of performativity
to take on el negro

00:38:02.220 --> 00:38:06.300
or la negra was very common,
when in fact they were mulatos.

00:38:06.300 --> 00:38:08.700
It's also a term of endearment,
in the Caribbean [speaking

00:38:08.700 --> 00:38:12.450
in foreign language], you know,
so it's a term of endearment,

00:38:12.450 --> 00:38:15.750
in addition to being
a derogatory term,

00:38:15.750 --> 00:38:18.690
usually in the diminutive
[speaking in foreign language].

00:38:18.690 --> 00:38:22.820
But it depends, it really
depends on the context.

00:38:22.820 --> 00:38:25.870
In Brazil, it's the same.

00:38:25.870 --> 00:38:28.440
It's often used as a
term of endearment.

00:38:28.440 --> 00:38:33.950
&gt;&gt; George Rice: Hi, my name is
George Rice, nice to meet you.

00:38:33.950 --> 00:38:37.140
So, I was born in Mexico
City and I just want

00:38:37.140 --> 00:38:39.890
to verify what my grandfather,
you know,

00:38:39.890 --> 00:38:41.190 position:56%
he's been telling me this for years.

00:38:41.190 --> 00:38:45.490 position:56%
So, one of the questions was why we
really never talk about black people

00:38:45.490 --> 00:38:49.000
in Mexico, he says basically
one of the reasons is

00:38:49.000 --> 00:38:50.710
that you know, they were free.

00:38:50.710 --> 00:38:52.450
They were not slaves in Mexico.

00:38:52.450 --> 00:38:54.010
And you know there was
never really an issue.

00:38:54.010 --> 00:38:55.860
So, I just want to verify that.

00:38:55.860 --> 00:38:57.380
And I had a question
on your picture,

00:38:57.380 --> 00:38:59.210
you mentioned that she had a gun.

00:38:59.210 --> 00:39:02.320
You know, Mexican culture
tends to be [foreign word],

00:39:02.320 --> 00:39:06.620
so I wonder if that comes
from a feminist movement

00:39:06.620 --> 00:39:08.160
where women were allowed
to carry arms.

00:39:08.160 --> 00:39:11.190
Because I know for a
fact in other cultures,

00:39:11.190 --> 00:39:13.330
women were you know,
they're homemakers.

00:39:13.330 --> 00:39:15.540
They sit at home, take
care of the kids.

00:39:15.540 --> 00:39:19.190
So, I just found that
piece fascinating.

00:39:19.190 --> 00:39:20.490
&gt;&gt; Christina Arce: It is.

00:39:20.490 --> 00:39:21.790
It's incredible.

00:39:21.790 --> 00:39:24.430
There's actually a
transgender [foreign word],

00:39:24.430 --> 00:39:30.280
who's also names [foreign
word], who only shows to where,

00:39:30.280 --> 00:39:33.250
she immediately transferred
into male garb.

00:39:33.250 --> 00:39:37.330
Oftentimes when they were colonels,
or when they h ad a military rank

00:39:37.330 --> 00:39:42.160
that was beyond just the common
soldier, they would sort of perform

00:39:42.160 --> 00:39:45.720
that authority through
dress, through the vestments.

00:39:45.720 --> 00:39:48.100
But you'll notice what's
interesting about that is

00:39:48.100 --> 00:39:49.420
that she still wears the earrings.

00:39:49.420 --> 00:39:54.240 position:56%
There's this way in which she's
still not abandoning her femaleness,

00:39:54.240 --> 00:39:56.350
you know her femininity
in terms of the garb.

00:39:56.350 --> 00:39:58.320
So, she's using both.

00:39:58.320 --> 00:40:04.200
So, that sort of gesture
is really interesting.

00:40:04.200 --> 00:40:06.180
You know, so but definitely,

00:40:06.180 --> 00:40:09.710
during the revolution many
soldaderas took up arms.

00:40:09.710 --> 00:40:12.560
Maybe they performed
traditional female roles

00:40:12.560 --> 00:40:15.620
by bringing the domesticity of
the home onto the battlefield.

00:40:15.620 --> 00:40:20.220 position:56%
I mean that in itself was
incredibly radicalizing to see women

00:40:20.220 --> 00:40:23.770
and children out on the
battlefield hanging clothes,

00:40:23.770 --> 00:40:26.310
carrying their [foreign
word], making beans.

00:40:26.310 --> 00:40:29.040 position:56%
But then at the same time when their
soldier fell, they would often pick

00:40:29.040 --> 00:40:31.140
up the rifle and continue
fighting for them,

00:40:31.140 --> 00:40:34.020
or they were looked to as leaders.

00:40:34.020 --> 00:40:36.090
I mean there's all
kinds, there's all;

00:40:36.090 --> 00:40:39.900
one of the most important
novels written by a Mexican,

00:40:39.900 --> 00:40:45.620
it's a testimonial novel by Elana
Pontitosca [assumed spelling] was

00:40:45.620 --> 00:40:51.510
precisely the interview of a
soldadera who followed her father

00:40:51.510 --> 00:40:53.230
and then and then her
husband into the war.

00:40:53.230 --> 00:40:57.610
And then when both of them fell,
the soldiers look to her to lead.

00:40:57.610 --> 00:41:01.380
So, there's this way in which,
there's a fluidity in gender roles

00:41:01.380 --> 00:41:05.340
that wartime, exigencies
of wartime will permit.

00:41:05.340 --> 00:41:07.810
But what happens after the war?

00:41:07.810 --> 00:41:10.750
They decided that soldaderas
were unacceptable.

00:41:10.750 --> 00:41:12.810
They made them wives.

00:41:12.810 --> 00:41:16.400
And that made it very difficult
for them to seek their pensions

00:41:16.400 --> 00:41:17.700
as revolutionary participants.

00:41:17.700 --> 00:41:21.050
That's what makes the situation
of [foreign word] so important is

00:41:21.050 --> 00:41:22.790
that she actually demanded it,

00:41:22.790 --> 00:41:25.400
as a veteran of the
revolution, as a soldadera.

00:41:25.400 --> 00:41:28.350
No? So, they took all
kinds of different roles.

00:41:28.350 --> 00:41:32.560
They were often spies,
smugglers and strategists.

00:41:32.560 --> 00:41:34.110
So, they took on different roles.

00:41:34.110 --> 00:41:35.900
And then some were just simply
cooks, and they were able

00:41:35.900 --> 00:41:39.280
to market themselves as through
their culinary expertise,

00:41:39.280 --> 00:41:41.150
their ability to make
a lot out of nothing.

00:41:41.150 --> 00:41:44.960
Because they handle the
soldada, the soldier's money,

00:41:44.960 --> 00:41:46.260
and were able to purchase
provisions.

00:41:46.260 --> 00:41:49.230
Remember there was no
commissary or even infirmary.

00:41:49.230 --> 00:41:51.560
So, that's what the
roles of soldaderas did.

00:41:51.560 --> 00:41:56.560
With regards to the first
comment on blacks in Mexico.

00:41:56.560 --> 00:42:02.260
Yes, Mexico was I think the
second country to abolish slavery.

00:42:02.260 --> 00:42:05.360
The second president of the
Mexican Republic after independence

00:42:05.360 --> 00:42:08.280
from Spain was an Afro Mexican.

00:42:08.280 --> 00:42:09.580
I mean people don't know that.

00:42:09.580 --> 00:42:11.480
They get whitened later on.

00:42:11.480 --> 00:42:14.860
One of the primary revolutionary
leaders was [foreign name]

00:42:14.860 --> 00:42:19.920
and he was also not
from [foreign word].

00:42:19.920 --> 00:42:23.280
And during the colony period, I
think what your father was eluding

00:42:23.280 --> 00:42:27.120
to was there was a very
prominent working class.

00:42:27.120 --> 00:42:29.130
Freed, black class.

00:42:29.130 --> 00:42:32.630
Why? Because slavery lasted
a generation or two at most.

00:42:32.630 --> 00:42:35.690
There was certainly the
chattel plantation model,

00:42:35.690 --> 00:42:37.520
which is what we think of
when we think of slavery,

00:42:37.520 --> 00:42:39.300
these big cotton plantations.

00:42:39.300 --> 00:42:42.230 position:56%
In Mexico it would've been sugar,
tobacco, [foreign word], and mining,

00:42:42.230 --> 00:42:45.240
but they were also
petaled off slavery,

00:42:45.240 --> 00:42:50.330
a slave could often acquire the
official, you know, of his master

00:42:50.330 --> 00:42:53.040
and the master often freed
him in his own lifetime.

00:42:53.040 --> 00:42:54.580
And the children were
often godchildren.

00:42:54.580 --> 00:42:56.530
So, there's this patronage,
of course,

00:42:56.530 --> 00:42:58.150
but they were often
freed in their lifetime.

00:42:58.150 --> 00:43:00.150
So, it would last a
generation or two at most.

00:43:00.150 --> 00:43:03.360
And there was an urban class,
it was an urban phenomenon.

00:43:03.360 --> 00:43:07.170
Mexico City had more blacks than
it did Spaniards at one point.

00:43:07.170 --> 00:43:08.800
In part because of slavery.

00:43:08.800 --> 00:43:12.180
But it's this particularized,
sort of localized slavery;

00:43:12.180 --> 00:43:14.260
fruit sellers, the shoemaker.

00:43:14.260 --> 00:43:16.910
I mean so they turned
into a vibrant class

00:43:16.910 --> 00:43:20.430
that then became Hispanicized
really early on.

00:43:20.430 --> 00:43:21.890
And so, they mixed
in really early on.

00:43:21.890 --> 00:43:23.650
So, there's an insistence
on phenotype.

00:43:23.650 --> 00:43:25.770
They said, well we don't
really have what looks

00:43:25.770 --> 00:43:28.250
like Brazil or Cuba here in Mexico.

00:43:28.250 --> 00:43:30.900
Thus, we don't really have an
important black population.

00:43:30.900 --> 00:43:32.940
But it mixed in really early on.

00:43:32.940 --> 00:43:35.020
And so, the slave trade
was abrogated very early

00:43:35.020 --> 00:43:36.700
on in Mexico as well.

00:43:36.700 --> 00:43:39.160
And they had rights
because of Canon Law.

00:43:39.160 --> 00:43:40.460
Because of the pope.

00:43:40.460 --> 00:43:41.760
So, they were able
to appeal the rights.

00:43:41.760 --> 00:43:44.580
I'm not saying that slavery
wasn't horrible in Mexico.

00:43:44.580 --> 00:43:47.580
But what I am saying is that they
had a little more liberty to appeal

00:43:47.580 --> 00:43:51.080
through the church, through the
mechanisms of the church to appeal

00:43:51.080 --> 00:43:58.010
to have regular families and to get
Sundays off and stay in the cities.

00:43:58.010 --> 00:44:02.630
Or, they mixed in with indigenous
populations, which is understudied.

00:44:02.630 --> 00:44:05.120
In part because there was,

00:44:05.120 --> 00:44:06.780
in colonial Mexico [speaking
in foreign language].

00:44:06.780 --> 00:44:11.020
Many times blacks would escape
to the indigenous communities.

00:44:11.020 --> 00:44:12.820
And then they were
no longer accounted.

00:44:12.820 --> 00:44:18.600 position:56%
And the last part about that is that
blacks also, there was no census.

00:44:18.600 --> 00:44:25.790
Because of that sort of viciousness
with regards to the caste system.

00:44:25.790 --> 00:44:29.970
The [foreign word], the
second president abrogated,

00:44:29.970 --> 00:44:33.650 position:56%
he also eliminated the caste system,
so that they would all be Mexicans,

00:44:33.650 --> 00:44:38.910
but then unfortunately eliminated
the record of blacks in Mexico.

00:44:38.910 --> 00:44:45.160
So thus, the invisibility
for 200 years until now.

00:44:45.160 --> 00:44:47.500
Yes. What's your name?

00:44:47.500 --> 00:44:49.470
&gt;&gt; Desiree.

00:44:49.470 --> 00:44:56.970
Hi. Thank you so much
for this [inaudible].

00:44:56.970 --> 00:45:08.560
Can you give us a sense of what
the relationship was between middle

00:45:08.560 --> 00:45:12.200
and upper class women who
kind of busied themselves

00:45:12.200 --> 00:45:20.830 position:56%
with like legal equity and feminism,
feminist work, and the soldadera.

00:45:20.830 --> 00:45:23.570
&gt;&gt; Christina Arce: Oh, during
the revolutionary period?

00:45:23.570 --> 00:45:25.550
Oh, that's a great question.

00:45:25.550 --> 00:45:29.110
Because there's a lot; not
a lot, but more written

00:45:29.110 --> 00:45:35.150
on precisely the upper class women
who; I mean the first battle cry

00:45:35.150 --> 00:45:38.280
of the Mexican revolution, which
preceded the Cuban Revolution,

00:45:38.280 --> 00:45:39.980
preceded the Russian Revolution,

00:45:39.980 --> 00:45:43.190
was actually at an upper-class
woman's house [foreign word]

00:45:43.190 --> 00:45:44.490
in northern Mexico.

00:45:44.490 --> 00:45:51.150 position:56%
So, they had a real important role,
in part because they were completely

00:45:51.150 --> 00:45:53.680
on the outside of Mexican society.

00:45:53.680 --> 00:45:55.200
So, because of the dictatorship

00:45:55.200 --> 00:45:57.820
of the paternalistic
patriarchal society.

00:45:57.820 --> 00:45:59.840
So, women in particular
upper-class women; so,

00:45:59.840 --> 00:46:04.240
there has been some scholarship,
particularly, Mexican scholars

00:46:04.240 --> 00:46:08.840
and North American scholars have
focused a lot on that relationship.

00:46:08.840 --> 00:46:13.850
Also, soldaderas were not looked
upon, they sort of like presented

00:46:13.850 --> 00:46:16.450
as this degenerate femininity.

00:46:16.450 --> 00:46:19.670
So, there was certainly
class tensions.

00:46:19.670 --> 00:46:21.930
One of the most important; so,
they would not have taken nicely

00:46:21.930 --> 00:46:23.230
to being called soldaderas.

00:46:23.230 --> 00:46:29.640
You know, because it was sort of
a pejorative way to call some sort

00:46:29.640 --> 00:46:34.220
of trashy women who
followed the troops right.

00:46:34.220 --> 00:46:38.980
It was almost like calling
them a prostitute, right?

00:46:38.980 --> 00:46:43.160
Whereas adelita acquired this
short of sweetheart intonation.

00:46:43.160 --> 00:46:45.470
So, definitely, I mean, but one

00:46:45.470 --> 00:46:47.580
of the most important figures
[foreign name] who wrote a book

00:46:47.580 --> 00:46:52.940
that was not published
in her lifetime.

00:46:52.940 --> 00:46:57.000
She went broke supporting
the revolution,

00:46:57.000 --> 00:46:59.170
she founded the White
Cross in Mexico.

00:46:59.170 --> 00:47:02.030
And was one of the primary
advisors to the [foreign word]

00:47:02.030 --> 00:47:05.500
who became president
afterwards regime.

00:47:05.500 --> 00:47:11.880
She was completely
unrecognized up until 20 years ago

00:47:11.880 --> 00:47:16.870 position:56%
when [foreign name] recovered her
book that was rejected over 20 times

00:47:16.870 --> 00:47:20.960
by different editorials in
Mexico and in the United States.

00:47:20.960 --> 00:47:24.100
She wrote her book in
Spanish and English.

00:47:24.100 --> 00:47:25.450
And is called [foreign
word], the rebel.

00:47:25.450 --> 00:47:30.200
And so, certainly she talks about,
she oftentimes will be disinclined

00:47:30.200 --> 00:47:33.650
to call the female
companion soldaderas.

00:47:33.650 --> 00:47:35.760
She'll call them, you know,
the nurse, or something else.

00:47:35.760 --> 00:47:37.060
[Foreign name], did the same.

00:47:37.060 --> 00:47:39.970
She wrote a beautiful set of short
stories on the Mexican Revolution

00:47:39.970 --> 00:47:44.300 position:56%
and she also, in a such a subsequent
revision took the word soldadera out

00:47:44.300 --> 00:47:46.660
and replace it with
woman or muchacha, no?

00:47:46.660 --> 00:47:48.100
Because I mean in a way to
not reduce into that level.

00:47:48.100 --> 00:47:49.400
So, they were very much,
there's a distinction

00:47:49.400 --> 00:47:50.700
between those class levels,

00:47:50.700 --> 00:47:52.000
yet women of upper-classes
joined the revolutionary forces,

00:47:52.000 --> 00:47:53.300
were often strategists.

00:47:53.300 --> 00:47:54.600
[Foreign name] had a
female strategist and orator

00:47:54.600 --> 00:47:55.900
that wrote five books on
the Mexican Revolution.

00:47:55.900 --> 00:47:58.200
None of that is recognized.

00:48:01.040 --> 00:48:03.680
Thank you so much for
coming this has been

00:48:03.680 --> 00:48:05.260
such an honor for me to be here.

00:48:05.260 --> 00:48:09.240
Thank you, Georgette [applause].

00:48:09.240 --> 00:48:13.090

of the Library of Congress.
