Speaker 1:          00:00          And then go, Hey, I'm Jad Abumrad. Hi, I'm Robert Krulwich, Radiolab. And today it's inheritance today. Yeah. We're exploring questions of like, uh, what can you pass down to your kids in their kids? What can't you, how much of you will echo into the future and how much of you won't? And I gotta say, I'm feeling pretty good about this show so far because, well, if, uh, if, if a mother, a little IRAP mother licking her baby can have such a profound effect, basically change the expression of the genes in the baby. Well that's you. You think you can get deep down. Look, in the end, what do I know? But, uh, I take it that we have more control over our destinies and our kids' destinies. And we would have thought, well, let's not get too excited too fast because, uh, well we, we, we have a story to tell.

Speaker 1:          00:48          And this, this one, this tale leaves me a little queasy. Oh, there was a contact. Hello? Hello. Yup, it's me. Oh, lamb. This is Oola. Hi Libby. You get in. I'm in public health, the Karolinska Institute in Sweden where he studies population data, looking for patterns in cardiovascular diseases, high blood pressure and such. But the story he told us begins around 25 years ago, way up in northern Sweden that Sam keen again, he's the guy who told us about Auden's work in our little community called over colleagues. What does it look like? Is it a big town, a little village? It's a small forest area. Very beautiful. But this was a really, really tough history. Grow Up. Very isolated and very cold. Are you near the Arctic circle or north of it? North of the Arctic Circle. Yeah. My home village was 10 miles north of popular. The goes, oh, so you grew up in uh, over Kaylee's.

Speaker 1:          01:48          Yeah, we had a, an expression here. Dig where you stand and it just so happened is this town is a perfect place today. Okay. I'm here. They are the kingdom archive because there is more data, more information about the people of overkill going farther back into the past and you can find almost anywhere else on earth. Yeah. We a really data rich. This is the Uber Colleagues Church parish. Yes, it is. Because he used to think the churches up and over calyx kept incredibly detailed records. We actually sent our friend Pike Malinowski to the archives and Stockholm to check it out. Says like Easter Register. In those books you can meet everything about the citizens of over calyx going back hundreds of years. What's his name? Even their names? Yes. [inaudible] what year they were born? 1814 1881 she was born 1904 and this is everything happening in the family is in these books. Nielsen, who was an idiot? He was an idiot. It's, sorry, what? What does that mean? He was an idiot, I guess. Yeah, he was, you know retarded,

Speaker 2:          03:00          right? Yeah. He or landing at score that he was this. He was miserable to look at. It's not very politically correct. No.

Speaker 1:          03:09          In any case, these books tell you when each of these folks died, how they died from disease.

Speaker 2:          03:15          She's from a pneumonia accident. She drowned. Oh my God. A lot of diagnosis actually influence cancer, heart disease, brain disease.

Speaker 1:          03:26          Interestingly, the church has also kept track of the farmers. Crows crops, livestock, how much they were growing each year, which turned out to be kind of an interesting thing to look out because every time the people in over calyx who were farming trying to eco living out of the soil, we have um, how much they harvest it. They would experience these wild changes from harvest to harvest. What you see in the records is that one year potatoes, crops that do great a hundred teachers. Wow, that's a lot of potatoes. A few years later there'd be a harsh winter. The crops failed and when the crops failed, famines, yeah, they basically start, I mean when you look at the records, you don't see huge spikes in mortality. So it didn't starve to death. They suddenly had to get by on a tiny fraction of the food that they were used to.

Speaker 2:          04:17          I didn't have grains. I mean they didn't tell the of

Speaker 1:          04:21          and so they just had to hold on for the entire winter. But then a few years would pass crops would bounce back. Would we have a lot more grain here and suddenly plenty of food. I could eat twice, three times as much, then oh no. Total crop failure, famine. Again, these changes would just bounce back and forth. Famine, feast, Salmon East again, and looking at these swings and Fortune Oola realized what he had here was a nice natural experiment because with all this data, he and his team could follow families forward in time through the generations. So if they saw somebody who was starving as a kid in 1820 they couldn't see well when those people had children and grandchildren, did anything change? Were there any consequences? They wanted to see basically the effects of starvation on multiple generations. What did you discover?

Speaker 2:          05:23          Well, it, it was some very interesting discovery.

Speaker 1:          05:29          That's a little odd actually. Here's what [inaudible] says. He, he found in the data, if you were a boy in over [inaudible] between the ages of nine and 12 years old, so that's the window, nine to 12 year old boy. And then we have one of those terribly rough winters and you're eating much less than normal, assuming that you can survive the ordeal and you grow up and you have kids of your own. The data seems to say that your kids will benefit from your suffering. Yeah, yeah.

Speaker 3:          05:58          They'll do better if you have a starving daddy. It turns out that the baby actually gets some sort of health benefit really. And these effects in fact were so strong that you could trace it to the grandfather, the grandfather, two generations. It seemed to have been passed down from multiple generations.

Speaker 1:          06:17          You mean if you had a starving grandfather, you would be a healthier grant boy for the, because you had a starving grandfather,

Speaker 3:          06:25          you got a health boost. If you had a starving grandfather,

Speaker 1:          06:31          what, what sort of health boost? Well, um, well they told us take heart disease, vascular disease. You said if you were a boy and you starved between the ages of nine and 12, and then you went on to become a father, then a grandfather, your grandkids were protected. Meaning that they had less incidents of heart disease, much less. How much less?

Speaker 2:          06:52          Well, it's um, one fourth then can we say

Speaker 1:          06:55          one fourth? Let me say this again. If you're a starving boy between nine to 12 years old now, it doesn't matter a whole lot. What happens to you after this? Your grandchildren will have one quarter of the risk of heart disease and if you eating a whole lot between nine and 12 one quarter.

Speaker 3:          07:11          Not only that, apparently those grandkids were less prone to diabetes. They lived longer lives. Something like 30 years on average.

Speaker 1:          07:20          This was [inaudible] the Alere instead of dying at 40 I'd live to 70 that kind of 30 years. Yes, exactly. I just don't, I wonder. It's such a surprising result. I wonder how much you believe in it.

Speaker 2:          07:35          Yeah, it sound saw that it's only a, the mechanisms are not so clear, but the results are very clear. The results are obvious to you. [inaudible] the results are quite obvious.

Speaker 1:          07:45          Just to be sure. We asked Francis Champagne, which she thinks of this data. I believe that. Well you do, and I'm Michael Meaney as well. I think the Swedish data are really, really strong and very reliable. Everybody we talked to seems to think there's something really interesting going on here, but what exactly. Maybe you can explain this to me, Robert. What exactly happens between nine to 12 that makes this big difference? Wow. So here's the thing. How old are your boys right now? Three and eight months. Okay. So here's what you're going to notice. Your boys will first grow taller and taller for the next few years, and when they get to be about nine, 10 years old, they're gonna stop growing just for a few years.

Speaker 3:          08:25          This is what's called d slow growth period.

Speaker 1:          08:29          Just for those years. That's nine 10, 11 just before puberty, they won't grow much on the outside, but on the inside,

Speaker 2:          08:39          that is the time when the sperms, while developing

Speaker 3:          08:42          what's happening during this time is that you're setting aside the stock of cells that you're going to draw on in the future to make sperm cells.

Speaker 2:          08:53          So they are sperms. So the thought

Speaker 1:          08:57          is when those little boys in over KLX were really, really hungry, their hunger started a chemical process that reached all the way down to the DNA. Inside the boys' spurn.

Speaker 2:          09:10          Something happens on the molecular level. What exactly? Well, uh, the DNA, the RNA micro RNA is a histone.

Speaker 1:          09:20          Anyway, that's it that you're just renaming

Speaker 2:          09:22          methylations phosphorylation and so on that just judo, that's all this is.

Speaker 1:          09:29          We don't know precisely how this happens, but somehow the experience of starvation marks the DNA. Maybe like those methyl things we were telling you about with the rats. Yeah. Telling some genes to turn off now or the genes to turn on. And the incredible thing is those marks stick around. This sperm carries these marks to the next generation and then the next one after that, right.

Speaker 4:          09:57          [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          09:57          so somehow by some kind of chemical mechanisms, starving grandpa back when he was about nine to 12 years old turned out to be a good thing. So it's like, um,

Speaker 4:          10:08          [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          10:08          GRANDPA's struggle is sort of jumping forward and giving me a leg up. Well that's the good news. But unfortunately there's um, there is some bad news here. Yeah. If your grandpa didn't starve, instead he lived through great times. He stuffed himself silly nine, 10, 11 years old. So he's a happy grandpa. You the grandson, you then

Speaker 2:          10:29          would have high frequency. So heart attacks as two diabetes, it was, uh, a fourfold risk.

Speaker 1:          10:38          Four, four, four, 400% greater. Yeah. I got to say, this is spooky. This is spooky because it's like, it does get, yeah. I mean it's like what if GRANDPA has a bad day? Suddenly you're marked. Yeah. Frankly, this makes being nine, 10, 11, 12 like a, a rather crucial and at a time and you're not making the best decisions anyway. Yeah. Cause GRANDPA's just nine. I should add to that. They have found very similar effects for smoking. For instance, if you start smoking when your, you know, 10, 11, something like that, you end up heading children with more problems. I, I initially felt very hopeful and excited about this research because it seems to suggest that a, that a body one body can respond to an environment and change and be flexible in a way we didn't think was possible. But this stuff you're telling me about Sweden feels very, um, grim in a certain way. Oh, you know, sometimes that your grandfather's suffering helps you, even if it helps. It's horrifying. Claim makes me claustrophobic. You feel kind of hemmed in by what your grandfather did? A little bit, I guess. I guess the way I would I would look at it is that, um, you can change your environment a lot more easily than you can change your genes.

Speaker 4:          11:50          [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          11:50          I think it's, is, what's weird here is that, is that we started trying to make a difference in our children and now we're surprised attacked by our GRANDPA. I'll tell you what I'm gonna do though. When a meal gets to be eight, I'm cutting him off. He's not eating it all. This may hurt you, my son, but I'm doing it for my grandchildren.

Speaker 5:          12:23          [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          12:32          thanks to [inaudible] reporter Pike Mellon off ski and Cardin Berquist young and I'm a senior archivist at a the national archive in Maria. Bye.
