recently called a moving experience in
 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:18.109
recently called a moving experience in
which we talked about various cartoony

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:18.119
which we talked about various cartoony

animation techniques that you could

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:19.470
animation techniques that you could
 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:21.950
animation techniques that you could
apply to user interfaces one of those

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:21.960
apply to user interfaces one of those
 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:24.019

techniques is called squash and stretch

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029
techniques is called squash and stretch
 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:26.420
techniques is called squash and stretch
and we're going to show a demo today

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430
and we're going to show a demo today
 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:28.009
and we're going to show a demo today
that shows some of that as well as

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019
that shows some of that as well as
 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:29.870
that shows some of that as well as
another technique that kicks in called

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880
another technique that kicks in called
 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.450
another technique that kicks in called
exaggeration so the idea with squash and

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460
exaggeration so the idea with squash and
 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:35.209
exaggeration so the idea with squash and
stretch is that objects in the real

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219
stretch is that objects in the real
 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:38.000
stretch is that objects in the real
world deform to some extent especially

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010
world deform to some extent especially
 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:41.030
world deform to some extent especially
when they hit say a wall if a body hits

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040
when they hit say a wall if a body hits
 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:42.950
when they hit say a wall if a body hits
a wall or hits the ground going very

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960
a wall or hits the ground going very
 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:44.900
a wall or hits the ground going very
fast it's not going to say in exactly

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910
fast it's not going to say in exactly
 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:46.639
fast it's not going to say in exactly
the same shape that it was before it hit

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649
the same shape that it was before it hit
 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:50.180
the same shape that it was before it hit
that unmoving object so maybe it's good

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190
that unmoving object so maybe it's good
 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.040
that unmoving object so maybe it's good
if you want your objects to have more of

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050
if you want your objects to have more of
 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:54.229
if you want your objects to have more of
a real-world feel or more organic and

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239
a real-world feel or more organic and
 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:56.180
a real-world feel or more organic and
natural feel to actually give them some

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190
natural feel to actually give them some
 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.790
natural feel to actually give them some
elements of this stretch ability as well

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800
elements of this stretch ability as well
 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.040
elements of this stretch ability as well
and the other element is exaggeration

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050
and the other element is exaggeration
 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:04.130
and the other element is exaggeration
which is the idea from cartoons is you

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140
which is the idea from cartoons is you
 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.109
which is the idea from cartoons is you
want to make it very obvious what's

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119
want to make it very obvious what's
 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:08.390
want to make it very obvious what's
going on and also at a playful aspect so

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400
going on and also at a playful aspect so
 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.460
going on and also at a playful aspect so
not only would things deform slightly

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470
not only would things deform slightly
 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:12.289
not only would things deform slightly
but maybe they would deform much more

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299
but maybe they would deform much more
 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:14.090
but maybe they would deform much more
than that just to exaggerate and enhance

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100
than that just to exaggerate and enhance
 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.100
than that just to exaggerate and enhance
the effect and really let the user know

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110
the effect and really let the user know
 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:18.530
the effect and really let the user know
exactly what's going on so let's see how

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540
exactly what's going on so let's see how
 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:19.820
exactly what's going on so let's see how
this works in a demo we have a very

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830
this works in a demo we have a very
 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:21.560
this works in a demo we have a very
simple demo where when I click on the

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570
simple demo where when I click on the
 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:23.330
simple demo where when I click on the
button the button is going to fall down

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340
button the button is going to fall down
 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:24.890
button the button is going to fall down
to the bottom of the screen with gravity

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900
to the bottom of the screen with gravity
 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.800
to the bottom of the screen with gravity
but before it bounces back up we've got

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810
but before it bounces back up we've got
 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:29.870
but before it bounces back up we've got
this feeling that the button is is of

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880
this feeling that the button is is of
 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:31.690
this feeling that the button is is of
this more elastic and rubbery material

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:31.700
this more elastic and rubbery material
 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:33.800
this more elastic and rubbery material
and so when it hits the ground it's

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810
and so when it hits the ground it's
 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:35.300
and so when it hits the ground it's
actually going to hear a little bit and

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310
actually going to hear a little bit and
 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:38.090
actually going to hear a little bit and
squash and stretch out before finally

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100
squash and stretch out before finally
 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.520
squash and stretch out before finally
snapping back and then bouncing back up

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530
snapping back and then bouncing back up
 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:43.940
snapping back and then bouncing back up
to its starting position I've enabled a

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950
to its starting position I've enabled a
 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:45.289
to its starting position I've enabled a
menu item so we can slow this thing down

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299
menu item so we can slow this thing down
 

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:46.789
menu item so we can slow this thing down
so we can see it in a little bit more

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799
so we can see it in a little bit more
 

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:48.770
so we can see it in a little bit more
glorious detail and you'll notice that

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780
glorious detail and you'll notice that
 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:50.810
glorious detail and you'll notice that
we're actually deforming the button as

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820
we're actually deforming the button as
 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:52.550
we're actually deforming the button as
it falls as well so it's not just when

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560
it falls as well so it's not just when
 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:55.160
it falls as well so it's not just when
it hits the the floor at the bottom of

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170
it hits the the floor at the bottom of
 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:57.260
it hits the the floor at the bottom of
the screen but also as it's falling the

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270
the screen but also as it's falling the
 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:58.760
the screen but also as it's falling the
object is actually stretching out

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770
object is actually stretching out
 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:00.319
object is actually stretching out
according to gravity a little bit it's

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:00.329
according to gravity a little bit it's
 

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:02.510
according to gravity a little bit it's
very subtle it's hard to catch when it's

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520
very subtle it's hard to catch when it's
 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:04.340
very subtle it's hard to catch when it's
running at full speed but it also

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350
running at full speed but it also
 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:07.100
running at full speed but it also
indicates to the user the subtle aspect

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110
indicates to the user the subtle aspect
 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:10.219
indicates to the user the subtle aspect
of this button is interacting

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229
of this button is interacting
 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:12.199
of this button is interacting
nicholae more with its environment than

00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:12.209
nicholae more with its environment than
 

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:14.539
nicholae more with its environment than
buttons typically do so let's take a

00:02:14.539 --> 00:02:14.549
buttons typically do so let's take a
 

00:02:14.549 --> 00:02:15.740
buttons typically do so let's take a
look at the code it's actually fairly

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:15.750
look at the code it's actually fairly
 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:17.839
look at the code it's actually fairly
straightforward animation code using

00:02:17.839 --> 00:02:17.849
straightforward animation code using
 

00:02:17.849 --> 00:02:20.420
straightforward animation code using
object animators and property values

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:20.430
object animators and property values
 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:21.920
object animators and property values
holders to animate these things in

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:21.930
holders to animate these things in
 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:24.259
holders to animate these things in
sequence so first of all we calculate

00:02:24.259 --> 00:02:24.269
sequence so first of all we calculate
 

00:02:24.269 --> 00:02:26.300
sequence so first of all we calculate
the animation duration based on whether

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:26.310
the animation duration based on whether
 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:29.330
the animation duration based on whether
we've enabled the scaling option there

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:29.340
we've enabled the scaling option there
 

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:30.820
we've enabled the scaling option there
so that we can see the animation run

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:30.830
so that we can see the animation run
 

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:34.520
so that we can see the animation run
really slowly we set the pivot point

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:34.530
really slowly we set the pivot point
 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:36.619
really slowly we set the pivot point
this is not necessary but it made some

00:02:36.619 --> 00:02:36.629
this is not necessary but it made some
 

00:02:36.629 --> 00:02:38.990
this is not necessary but it made some
of the code a little bit simpler so that

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:39.000
of the code a little bit simpler so that
 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:40.339
of the code a little bit simpler so that
we didn't have to sort of change the

00:02:40.339 --> 00:02:40.349
we didn't have to sort of change the
 

00:02:40.349 --> 00:02:43.280
we didn't have to sort of change the
translation and scale around a

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:43.290
translation and scale around a
 

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:44.780
translation and scale around a
particular point so we set the pivot

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:44.790
particular point so we set the pivot
 

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:46.819
particular point so we set the pivot
point that all the scales will happen

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:46.829
point that all the scales will happen
 

00:02:46.829 --> 00:02:49.309
point that all the scales will happen
around to the bottom of the object and

00:02:49.309 --> 00:02:49.319
around to the bottom of the object and
 

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:52.039
around to the bottom of the object and
then we use property values holder to

00:02:52.039 --> 00:02:52.049
then we use property values holder to
 

00:02:52.049 --> 00:02:53.630
then we use property values holder to
animate several properties on the same

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:53.640
animate several properties on the same
 

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:55.670
animate several properties on the same
target object in parallel we're going to

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:55.680
target object in parallel we're going to
 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:57.770
target object in parallel we're going to
animate the translation Y as well as the

00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:57.780
animate the translation Y as well as the
 

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:59.809
animate the translation Y as well as the
scale X and scale Y properties on the

00:02:59.809 --> 00:02:59.819
scale X and scale Y properties on the
 

00:02:59.819 --> 00:03:01.190
scale X and scale Y properties on the
way down so we're going to move the

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:01.200
way down so we're going to move the
 

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:03.050
way down so we're going to move the
object down and as we move it we're

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:03.060
object down and as we move it we're
 

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:04.460
object down and as we move it we're
going to stretch it out in wire we're

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:04.470
going to stretch it out in wire we're
 

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:06.979
going to stretch it out in wire we're
going to squish it in and X as it goes

00:03:06.979 --> 00:03:06.989
going to squish it in and X as it goes
 

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:09.410
going to squish it in and X as it goes
we're going to create the down animation

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:09.420
we're going to create the down animation
 

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:11.119
we're going to create the down animation
with a single object animator using

00:03:11.119 --> 00:03:11.129
with a single object animator using
 

00:03:11.129 --> 00:03:12.530
with a single object animator using
these three property values holder

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:12.540
these three property values holder
 

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:14.119
these three property values holder
objects we're going to set an

00:03:14.119 --> 00:03:14.129
objects we're going to set an
 

00:03:14.129 --> 00:03:15.890
objects we're going to set an
interpolator to an accelerate

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:15.900
interpolator to an accelerate
 

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:17.569
interpolator to an accelerate
interpolator because we want it to look

00:03:17.569 --> 00:03:17.579
interpolator because we want it to look
 

00:03:17.579 --> 00:03:18.890
interpolator because we want it to look
like it's reacting to gravity and

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:18.900
like it's reacting to gravity and
 

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:20.839
like it's reacting to gravity and
actually going faster the further down

00:03:20.839 --> 00:03:20.849
actually going faster the further down
 

00:03:20.849 --> 00:03:22.819
actually going faster the further down
it falls and then we're going to set the

00:03:22.819 --> 00:03:22.829
it falls and then we're going to set the
 

00:03:22.829 --> 00:03:24.559
it falls and then we're going to set the
duration according to the duration we

00:03:24.559 --> 00:03:24.569
duration according to the duration we
 

00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:27.110
duration according to the duration we
calculated before once we hit the bottom

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:27.120
calculated before once we hit the bottom
 

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:29.690
calculated before once we hit the bottom
then we're going to stretch out in X and

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:29.700
then we're going to stretch out in X and
 

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:32.270
then we're going to stretch out in X and
squash down and Y like a rubbery object

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:32.280
squash down and Y like a rubbery object
 

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:34.640
squash down and Y like a rubbery object
might if it hits such a hard thing as a

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:34.650
might if it hits such a hard thing as a
 

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:36.650
might if it hits such a hard thing as a
floor so we're going to use again

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:36.660
floor so we're going to use again
 

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:38.089
floor so we're going to use again
property values holder is to animate

00:03:38.089 --> 00:03:38.099
property values holder is to animate
 

00:03:38.099 --> 00:03:40.640
property values holder is to animate
scale X and scale Y in parallel the

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:40.650
scale X and scale Y in parallel the
 

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:42.349
scale X and scale Y in parallel the
stretch animation is going to use those

00:03:42.349 --> 00:03:42.359
stretch animation is going to use those
 

00:03:42.359 --> 00:03:44.780
stretch animation is going to use those
property values holders directly we're

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:44.790
property values holders directly we're
 

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:46.309
property values holders directly we're
going to set a repeat counter repeat

00:03:46.309 --> 00:03:46.319
going to set a repeat counter repeat
 

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:48.559
going to set a repeat counter repeat
mode so we want it to squash and stretch

00:03:48.559 --> 00:03:48.569
mode so we want it to squash and stretch
 

00:03:48.569 --> 00:03:50.330
mode so we want it to squash and stretch
out and then we want it to snap back to

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:50.340
out and then we want it to snap back to
 

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:52.280
out and then we want it to snap back to
where it was so it's the same animation

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:52.290
where it was so it's the same animation
 

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:53.869
where it was so it's the same animation
running in Reverse according to the

00:03:53.869 --> 00:03:53.879
running in Reverse according to the
 

00:03:53.879 --> 00:03:56.119
running in Reverse according to the
repeat count and repeat mode here we're

00:03:56.119 --> 00:03:56.129
repeat count and repeat mode here we're
 

00:03:56.129 --> 00:03:57.229
repeat count and repeat mode here we're
going to set an interpolator of

00:03:57.229 --> 00:03:57.239
going to set an interpolator of
 

00:03:57.239 --> 00:03:59.210
going to set an interpolator of
decelerator so as it stretches out I

00:03:59.210 --> 00:03:59.220
decelerator so as it stretches out I
 

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:00.500
decelerator so as it stretches out I
wanted this feeling of the rubbery

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:00.510
wanted this feeling of the rubbery
 

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:02.809
wanted this feeling of the rubbery
material having this tension the further

00:04:02.809 --> 00:04:02.819
material having this tension the further
 

00:04:02.819 --> 00:04:04.430
material having this tension the further
out it goes is slower it's going to go

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:04.440
out it goes is slower it's going to go
 

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:05.629
out it goes is slower it's going to go
until it finally reaches the end and

00:04:05.629 --> 00:04:05.639
until it finally reaches the end and
 

00:04:05.639 --> 00:04:07.520
until it finally reaches the end and
then snaps back and as a snapped back

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:07.530
then snaps back and as a snapped back
 

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:08.689
then snaps back and as a snapped back
it's going to use the reverse of

00:04:08.689 --> 00:04:08.699
it's going to use the reverse of
 

00:04:08.699 --> 00:04:10.729
it's going to use the reverse of
deceleration so it's going to accelerate

00:04:10.729 --> 00:04:10.739
deceleration so it's going to accelerate
 

00:04:10.739 --> 00:04:12.860
deceleration so it's going to accelerate
which is what again this elastic a

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:12.870
which is what again this elastic a
 

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:15.199
which is what again this elastic a
rubbery object would do and then we're

00:04:15.199 --> 00:04:15.209
rubbery object would do and then we're
 

00:04:15.209 --> 00:04:17.300
rubbery object would do and then we're
going to animate back to the top so

00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:17.310
going to animate back to the top so
 

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:19.459
going to animate back to the top so
again we're just animating translation Y

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:19.469
again we're just animating translation Y
 

00:04:19.469 --> 00:04:21.229
again we're just animating translation Y
and scale X and scale Y basically the

00:04:21.229 --> 00:04:21.239
and scale X and scale Y basically the
 

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:23.060
and scale X and scale Y basically the
reverse of what we did before including

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:23.070
reverse of what we did before including
 

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:25.010
reverse of what we did before including
using a decelerate er to give the effect

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:25.020
using a decelerate er to give the effect
 

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:26.990
using a decelerate er to give the effect
of pulling up against gravity and then

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:27.000
of pulling up against gravity and then
 

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.480
of pulling up against gravity and then
slowing as it reaches the top of the

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:29.490
slowing as it reaches the top of the
 

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:31.100
slowing as it reaches the top of the
curve ready to go again we're going to

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:31.110
curve ready to go again we're going to
 

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:32.510
curve ready to go again we're going to
use an animator set to put these things

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:32.520
use an animator set to put these things
 

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:34.040
use an animator set to put these things
together we're going to play them in

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:34.050
together we're going to play them in
 

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:36.110
together we're going to play them in
sequence so first we animate down then

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:36.120
sequence so first we animate down then
 

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:37.850
sequence so first we animate down then
we stretch and squash out repeat that

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:37.860
we stretch and squash out repeat that
 

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:39.740
we stretch and squash out repeat that
back to where it was and then we run the

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:39.750
back to where it was and then we run the
 

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:44.090
back to where it was and then we run the
up animation and that's it thanks
