00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:02.790
If Ginny is heterozygous for the allele that

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:06.200
causes achondroplasia if she has a plus and a

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:09.670
minus allele. What's the probability that she will

00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:13.140
pass the affected allele on to her children? You

00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:16.110
have five options here. Just think about how

00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:19.190
many alleles Ginny has to offer And just try

00:00:19.190 --> 00:00:21.400
to take a guess about the probability that

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:25.310
she'll pass on the plus alelle, the dominant allele,

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:26.170
to one of her children.
