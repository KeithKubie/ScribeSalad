about solving energy challenges in the
lab and when I was in graduate school at

00:06:36.790 --> 00:06:36.800
lab and when I was in graduate school at
 

00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:39.370

the more I learned about the path

00:06:45.510 --> 00:06:45.520
the more I learned about the path
 

00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:49.210
the more I learned about the path
afterwards I realized there's no pathway

00:06:49.210 --> 00:06:49.220
afterwards I realized there's no pathway
 

00:06:49.220 --> 00:06:51.610
afterwards I realized there's no pathway
out or that the pathway out is really

00:06:51.610 --> 00:06:51.620
out or that the pathway out is really
 

00:06:51.620 --> 00:06:53.350
out or that the pathway out is really
broken and that's when I started

00:06:53.350 --> 00:06:53.360
broken and that's when I started
 

00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:56.290

world's largest oil and gas companies

00:08:38.339 --> 00:08:38.349
world's largest oil and gas companies
 

00:08:38.349 --> 00:08:40.920
world's largest oil and gas companies
and I'm helping them drive towards a

00:08:40.920 --> 00:08:40.930
and I'm helping them drive towards a
 

00:08:40.930 --> 00:08:43.800
and I'm helping them drive towards a
zero carbon future and so our model is

00:08:43.800 --> 00:08:43.810
zero carbon future and so our model is
 

00:08:43.810 --> 00:08:47.249
zero carbon future and so our model is
now somewhat akin to what what Dave was

as I went through grad school it started

00:09:23.009 --> 00:09:23.019
as I went through grad school it started
 

00:09:23.019 --> 00:09:27.449
as I went through grad school it started
to shift to to the idea that you can

00:09:27.449 --> 00:09:27.459
to shift to to the idea that you can
 

00:09:27.459 --> 00:09:29.610

well which one of those makes the most

00:10:40.569 --> 00:10:40.579
well which one of those makes the most
 

00:10:40.579 --> 00:10:42.399
well which one of those makes the most
sense and you can't do that

00:10:42.399 --> 00:10:42.409
sense and you can't do that
 

00:10:42.409 --> 00:10:44.019

really important that people who are
 

00:10:57.259 --> 00:10:59.409
really important that people who are
working on the technology really need to

00:10:59.409 --> 00:10:59.419
working on the technology really need to
 

00:10:59.419 --> 00:11:01.299
working on the technology really need to

socio-political economic you name it
it's affected really energy is kind of

00:17:39.410 --> 00:17:39.420
it's affected really energy is kind of

the Nexus of life so to speak you you

00:17:41.660 --> 00:17:41.670
the Nexus of life so to speak you you
 

00:17:41.670 --> 00:17:43.130
the Nexus of life so to speak you you
can't get around it through it or

can't get around it through it or
 

00:17:43.140 --> 00:17:45.260
can't get around it through it or

an awful lot easier for those people
that have it so let me move on to the

00:17:50.690 --> 00:17:50.700
that have it so let me move on to the
 

00:17:50.700 --> 00:17:51.530
that have it so let me move on to the
next question

00:17:51.530 --> 00:17:51.540
next question
 

00:17:51.540 --> 00:17:53.480
next question

or I mean all of you could be regarded
 

00:17:53.490 --> 00:17:55.790
or I mean all of you could be regarded
as as being involved in sort of social

more than just your dollar affecting

more than just your dollar affecting
 

00:18:00.060 --> 00:18:02.780
more than just your dollar affecting

people would call it the Golden Age of

00:18:04.580 --> 00:18:04.590
people would call it the Golden Age of
 

00:18:04.590 --> 00:18:07.790
people would call it the Golden Age of
impact investing is that the Golden Age

00:18:07.790 --> 00:18:07.800
impact investing is that the Golden Age
 

00:18:07.800 --> 00:18:15.650
impact investing is that the Golden Age
is the kind of last or is it a fan run

00:18:15.650 --> 00:18:15.660
is the kind of last or is it a fan run
 

00:18:15.660 --> 00:18:18.500
is the kind of last or is it a fan run
with it go ahead I'll leap in just

00:18:18.500 --> 00:18:18.510
with it go ahead I'll leap in just
 

00:18:18.510 --> 00:18:22.190
with it go ahead I'll leap in just
quickly I think the phrase Golden Age

00:18:22.190 --> 00:18:22.200
quickly I think the phrase Golden Age
 

00:18:22.200 --> 00:18:24.200
quickly I think the phrase Golden Age
may be a little bit aggressive because I

00:18:24.200 --> 00:18:24.210
may be a little bit aggressive because I
 

00:18:24.210 --> 00:18:26.500
may be a little bit aggressive because I
think we're really only at the front end

00:18:26.500 --> 00:18:26.510
think we're really only at the front end
 

00:18:26.510 --> 00:18:29.210
think we're really only at the front end
you know if you just consider that

00:18:29.210 --> 00:18:29.220
you know if you just consider that
 

00:18:29.220 --> 00:18:31.310
you know if you just consider that
trillions of dollars if through the

00:18:31.310 --> 00:18:31.320
trillions of dollars if through the
 

00:18:31.320 --> 00:18:34.160
trillions of dollars if through the
capital markets I mean they're so it's

00:18:34.160 --> 00:18:34.170
capital markets I mean they're so it's
 

00:18:34.170 --> 00:18:36.350
capital markets I mean they're so it's
it's almost a rounding error in terms of

00:18:36.350 --> 00:18:36.360
it's almost a rounding error in terms of
 

00:18:36.360 --> 00:18:38.420
it's almost a rounding error in terms of
the type of you know investment that's

00:18:38.420 --> 00:18:38.430
the type of you know investment that's
 

00:18:38.430 --> 00:18:40.940
the type of you know investment that's
going into you know the impact category

00:18:40.940 --> 00:18:40.950
going into you know the impact category
 

00:18:40.950 --> 00:18:42.860
going into you know the impact category
so I think it's just at the very very

00:18:42.860 --> 00:18:42.870
so I think it's just at the very very
 

00:18:42.870 --> 00:18:46.250
so I think it's just at the very very
front end and you know Prime Coalition

00:18:46.250 --> 00:18:46.260
front end and you know Prime Coalition
 

00:18:46.260 --> 00:18:48.230
front end and you know Prime Coalition
is doing great work trying to figure out

00:18:48.230 --> 00:18:48.240
is doing great work trying to figure out
 

00:18:48.240 --> 00:18:50.930
is doing great work trying to figure out
how to get foundations you know into the

00:18:50.930 --> 00:18:50.940
how to get foundations you know into the
 

00:18:50.940 --> 00:18:53.180
how to get foundations you know into the
marketplace you know that describes

00:18:53.180 --> 00:18:53.190
marketplace you know that describes
 

00:18:53.190 --> 00:18:55.550
marketplace you know that describes
trying to get high net worth individuals

00:18:55.550 --> 00:18:55.560
trying to get high net worth individuals
 

00:18:55.560 --> 00:18:56.930
trying to get high net worth individuals
in the marketplace I mean we're only

00:18:56.930 --> 00:18:56.940
in the marketplace I mean we're only
 

00:18:56.940 --> 00:18:59.630
in the marketplace I mean we're only
we're only at the very very very

00:18:59.630 --> 00:18:59.640
we're only at the very very very
 

00:18:59.640 --> 00:19:03.740
we're only at the very very very
beginning first steps so yeah I would

00:19:03.740 --> 00:19:03.750
beginning first steps so yeah I would
 

00:19:03.750 --> 00:19:05.270
beginning first steps so yeah I would
agree with that I don't think it's a fad

00:19:05.270 --> 00:19:05.280
agree with that I don't think it's a fad
 

00:19:05.280 --> 00:19:09.860
agree with that I don't think it's a fad
I think it's a trend that is that it

00:19:09.860 --> 00:19:09.870
I think it's a trend that is that it
 

00:19:09.870 --> 00:19:13.370
I think it's a trend that is that it
will continue to grow I think it's very

00:19:13.370 --> 00:19:13.380
will continue to grow I think it's very
 

00:19:13.380 --> 00:19:16.010
will continue to grow I think it's very
it's a very imprecise term

00:19:16.010 --> 00:19:16.020
it's a very imprecise term
 

00:19:16.020 --> 00:19:18.980
it's a very imprecise term
so I always when I get asked about

00:19:18.980 --> 00:19:18.990
so I always when I get asked about
 

00:19:18.990 --> 00:19:20.240
so I always when I get asked about
impact investing I always try to

00:19:20.240 --> 00:19:20.250
impact investing I always try to
 

00:19:20.250 --> 00:19:22.430
impact investing I always try to
understand what someone means by that

00:19:22.430 --> 00:19:22.440
understand what someone means by that
 

00:19:22.440 --> 00:19:25.130
understand what someone means by that
and there can be there are there shades

00:19:25.130 --> 00:19:25.140
and there can be there are there shades
 

00:19:25.140 --> 00:19:27.560
and there can be there are there shades
of what that means and I think some of

00:19:27.560 --> 00:19:27.570
of what that means and I think some of
 

00:19:27.570 --> 00:19:29.390
of what that means and I think some of
those shades are represented on this

00:19:29.390 --> 00:19:29.400
those shades are represented on this
 

00:19:29.400 --> 00:19:31.520
those shades are represented on this
panel which is great so sometimes that

00:19:31.520 --> 00:19:31.530
panel which is great so sometimes that
 

00:19:31.530 --> 00:19:37.160
panel which is great so sometimes that
can mean profit seeking capital seeking

00:19:37.160 --> 00:19:37.170
can mean profit seeking capital seeking
 

00:19:37.170 --> 00:19:39.770
can mean profit seeking capital seeking
impact alongside it so there's there's

00:19:39.770 --> 00:19:39.780
impact alongside it so there's there's
 

00:19:39.780 --> 00:19:41.630
impact alongside it so there's there's
absolutely no concession in terms of

00:19:41.630 --> 00:19:41.640
absolutely no concession in terms of
 

00:19:41.640 --> 00:19:43.430
absolutely no concession in terms of
what's being sought sometimes there is

00:19:43.430 --> 00:19:43.440
what's being sought sometimes there is
 

00:19:43.440 --> 00:19:45.140
what's being sought sometimes there is
what's called concessionary capital

00:19:45.140 --> 00:19:45.150
what's called concessionary capital
 

00:19:45.150 --> 00:19:47.660
what's called concessionary capital
that's looking to take that that's all

00:19:47.660 --> 00:19:47.670
that's looking to take that that's all
 

00:19:47.670 --> 00:19:51.770
that's looking to take that that's all
right with taking some some lower return

00:19:51.770 --> 00:19:51.780
right with taking some some lower return
 

00:19:51.780 --> 00:19:53.540
right with taking some some lower return
or accepting some lower return or taking

00:19:53.540 --> 00:19:53.550
or accepting some lower return or taking
 

00:19:53.550 --> 00:19:55.280
or accepting some lower return or taking
higher risk with some trade-off for

00:19:55.280 --> 00:19:55.290
higher risk with some trade-off for
 

00:19:55.290 --> 00:19:58.400
higher risk with some trade-off for
impact where Prime is on that is we are

00:19:58.400 --> 00:19:58.410
impact where Prime is on that is we are
 

00:19:58.410 --> 00:20:00.530
impact where Prime is on that is we are
unabashedly impact first but we're only

00:20:00.530 --> 00:20:00.540
unabashedly impact first but we're only
 

00:20:00.540 --> 00:20:02.500
unabashedly impact first but we're only
able to do that because we're using

00:20:02.500 --> 00:20:02.510
able to do that because we're using
 

00:20:02.510 --> 00:20:05.270
able to do that because we're using
charitable philanthropic capital and we

00:20:05.270 --> 00:20:05.280
charitable philanthropic capital and we
 

00:20:05.280 --> 00:20:07.070
charitable philanthropic capital and we
it probably would not be appropriate for

00:20:07.070 --> 00:20:07.080
it probably would not be appropriate for
 

00:20:07.080 --> 00:20:09.280
it probably would not be appropriate for
most venture funds to take that approach

00:20:09.280 --> 00:20:09.290
most venture funds to take that approach
 

00:20:09.290 --> 00:20:11.690
most venture funds to take that approach
so I think there's a whole continuum and

00:20:11.690 --> 00:20:11.700
so I think there's a whole continuum and
 

00:20:11.700 --> 00:20:14.450
so I think there's a whole continuum and
it's useful to describe it because I

00:20:14.450 --> 00:20:14.460
it's useful to describe it because I
 

00:20:14.460 --> 00:20:17.720
it's useful to describe it because I
think that as we see that trend evolve

00:20:17.720 --> 00:20:17.730
think that as we see that trend evolve
 

00:20:17.730 --> 00:20:22.940
think that as we see that trend evolve
it'll kind of move if from one end which

00:20:22.940 --> 00:20:22.950
it'll kind of move if from one end which
 

00:20:22.950 --> 00:20:24.830
it'll kind of move if from one end which
is more kind of double bottom-line focus

00:20:24.830 --> 00:20:24.840
is more kind of double bottom-line focus
 

00:20:24.840 --> 00:20:26.510
is more kind of double bottom-line focus
yes we're in it for impact but we're

00:20:26.510 --> 00:20:26.520
yes we're in it for impact but we're
 

00:20:26.520 --> 00:20:28.190
yes we're in it for impact but we're
also in it we're not surrendering any

00:20:28.190 --> 00:20:28.200
also in it we're not surrendering any
 

00:20:28.200 --> 00:20:30.260
also in it we're not surrendering any
returns I think that's where we're

00:20:30.260 --> 00:20:30.270
returns I think that's where we're
 

00:20:30.270 --> 00:20:32.960
returns I think that's where we're
seeing the trends start and it will I

00:20:32.960 --> 00:20:32.970
seeing the trends start and it will I
 

00:20:32.970 --> 00:20:35.120
seeing the trends start and it will I
think continue to evolve along that

00:20:35.120 --> 00:20:35.130
think continue to evolve along that
 

00:20:35.130 --> 00:20:39.470
think continue to evolve along that
spectrum is my guess I'll jump in and my

00:20:39.470 --> 00:20:39.480
spectrum is my guess I'll jump in and my
 

00:20:39.480 --> 00:20:40.880

my perspective on this having been

through a cycle or so 2007 was the

through a cycle or so 2007 was the
golden age of course we were completely

golden age of course we were completely

golden age of course we were completely
clueless and lost all of our money so be

00:20:48.650 --> 00:20:48.660
clueless and lost all of our money so be

however have reason for optimism in in

about breakthrough energy ventures OGC I

00:21:17.570 --> 00:21:17.580
about breakthrough energy ventures OGC I
 

00:21:17.580 --> 00:21:19.700
about breakthrough energy ventures OGC I
is an example in the energy sector which

00:21:19.700 --> 00:21:19.710
is an example in the energy sector which
 

00:21:19.710 --> 00:21:21.210
is an example in the energy sector which
is a consortium

00:21:21.210 --> 00:21:21.220
is a consortium
 

00:21:21.220 --> 00:21:23.549
is a consortium
ten you know global energy companies who

00:21:23.549 --> 00:21:23.559
ten you know global energy companies who
 

00:21:23.559 --> 00:21:26.730
ten you know global energy companies who
put in a billion dollars you know to

00:21:26.730 --> 00:21:26.740
put in a billion dollars you know to
 

00:21:26.740 --> 00:21:29.370
put in a billion dollars you know to
provoke you know I think what we created

00:21:29.370 --> 00:21:29.380
provoke you know I think what we created
 

00:21:29.380 --> 00:21:30.990
provoke you know I think what we created
evoke is an interesting approach where

00:21:30.990 --> 00:21:31.000
evoke is an interesting approach where
 

00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:33.380
evoke is an interesting approach where
we take some some of the attributes of

00:21:33.380 --> 00:21:33.390
we take some some of the attributes of
 

00:21:33.390 --> 00:21:35.100
we take some some of the attributes of
traditional financial venture

00:21:35.100 --> 00:21:35.110

investments with strategic investing and

00:21:39.029 --> 00:21:39.039
investments with strategic investing and
 

00:21:39.039 --> 00:21:40.500
investments with strategic investing and
now you're also starting to see some

00:21:40.500 --> 00:21:40.510
now you're also starting to see some
 

00:21:40.510 --> 00:21:43.590
now you're also starting to see some
models that are supporting those

00:21:43.590 --> 00:21:43.600
models that are supporting those
 

00:21:43.600 --> 00:21:46.470
models that are supporting those
companies that we screwed up in 2007 and

00:21:46.470 --> 00:21:46.480
companies that we screwed up in 2007 and
 

00:21:46.480 --> 00:21:48.600
companies that we screwed up in 2007 and

incubator programs like cyclotron Road

00:21:50.520 --> 00:21:50.530
incubator programs like cyclotron Road
 

00:21:50.530 --> 00:21:51.930
incubator programs like cyclotron Road
which I love and we've invested in

00:21:51.930 --> 00:21:51.940
which I love and we've invested in
 

00:21:51.940 --> 00:21:54.149
which I love and we've invested in
several cyclotron Road companies and if

00:21:54.149 --> 00:21:54.159
several cyclotron Road companies and if
 

00:21:54.159 --> 00:21:57.270
several cyclotron Road companies and if
you're in the physical sciences space

00:21:57.270 --> 00:21:57.280
you're in the physical sciences space
 

00:21:57.280 --> 00:21:58.770
you're in the physical sciences space
and trying to commercialize I can't

00:21:58.770 --> 00:21:58.780
and trying to commercialize I can't
 

00:21:58.780 --> 00:22:00.659
and trying to commercialize I can't
recommend a program higher and I hope

00:22:00.659 --> 00:22:00.669
recommend a program higher and I hope
 

00:22:00.669 --> 00:22:02.279
recommend a program higher and I hope
they replicate this I know they're

00:22:02.279 --> 00:22:02.289
they replicate this I know they're
 

00:22:02.289 --> 00:22:03.630
they replicate this I know they're
starting to replicate at National Labs

00:22:03.630 --> 00:22:03.640
starting to replicate at National Labs
 

00:22:03.640 --> 00:22:05.640
starting to replicate at National Labs
but I hope that universities are

00:22:05.640 --> 00:22:05.650
but I hope that universities are
 

00:22:05.650 --> 00:22:07.110
but I hope that universities are
starting to look at that also I think

00:22:07.110 --> 00:22:07.120
starting to look at that also I think
 

00:22:07.120 --> 00:22:13.910
starting to look at that also I think
it's a fantastic model

00:22:13.910 --> 00:22:13.920
 
 

00:22:13.920 --> 00:22:16.040
 
so so I'll just add to that I think that

00:22:16.040 --> 00:22:16.050
so so I'll just add to that I think that
 

00:22:16.050 --> 00:22:18.350
so so I'll just add to that I think that
one of the issues with with impact

00:22:18.350 --> 00:22:18.360
one of the issues with with impact
 

00:22:18.360 --> 00:22:21.740
one of the issues with with impact
investing is how do you have a sort of

00:22:21.740 --> 00:22:21.750
investing is how do you have a sort of
 

00:22:21.750 --> 00:22:24.320
investing is how do you have a sort of
an objective quantifiable screen for

00:22:24.320 --> 00:22:24.330
an objective quantifiable screen for
 

00:22:24.330 --> 00:22:27.620
an objective quantifiable screen for
what that impact is and it's very

00:22:27.620 --> 00:22:27.630
what that impact is and it's very
 

00:22:27.630 --> 00:22:30.650
what that impact is and it's very
difficult if you're an investor to all

00:22:30.650 --> 00:22:30.660
difficult if you're an investor to all
 

00:22:30.660 --> 00:22:34.540
difficult if you're an investor to all
of a sudden understand but how you can

00:22:34.540 --> 00:22:34.550
of a sudden understand but how you can
 

00:22:34.550 --> 00:22:37.850
of a sudden understand but how you can
condense all the nuance metrics that

00:22:37.850 --> 00:22:37.860
condense all the nuance metrics that
 

00:22:37.860 --> 00:22:39.380
condense all the nuance metrics that
could go into something like impact

00:22:39.380 --> 00:22:39.390
could go into something like impact
 

00:22:39.390 --> 00:22:42.020
could go into something like impact

00:22:49.310 --> 00:22:49.320
the things that that cyclotron Road does
 

00:22:49.320 --> 00:22:52.460
the things that that cyclotron Road does
is it is it provides a very highly

00:22:52.460 --> 00:22:52.470

the personality characteristics that we
look for in our innovators that we think

will lead to successful outcomes yeah I

00:23:07.340 --> 00:23:07.350
will lead to successful outcomes yeah I
 

00:23:07.350 --> 00:23:09.680
will lead to successful outcomes yeah I
think that's a important point and I

00:23:09.680 --> 00:23:09.690
think that's a important point and I
 

00:23:09.690 --> 00:23:11.720
think that's a important point and I
know prime actually has written a paper

00:23:11.720 --> 00:23:11.730
know prime actually has written a paper
 

00:23:11.730 --> 00:23:15.080
know prime actually has written a paper
on this but the question you know the

00:23:15.080 --> 00:23:15.090
on this but the question you know the
 

00:23:15.090 --> 00:23:18.020
on this but the question you know the
impact in how you define it and how you

00:23:18.020 --> 00:23:18.030
impact in how you define it and how you
 

00:23:18.030 --> 00:23:21.740
impact in how you define it and how you
measure it is basically nobody's cracked

00:23:21.740 --> 00:23:21.750
measure it is basically nobody's cracked
 

00:23:21.750 --> 00:23:23.360
measure it is basically nobody's cracked
the code on that there's not a

00:23:23.360 --> 00:23:23.370
the code on that there's not a
 

00:23:23.370 --> 00:23:25.010
the code on that there's not a
consistent framework there's not a

00:23:25.010 --> 00:23:25.020
consistent framework there's not a
 

00:23:25.020 --> 00:23:27.170
consistent framework there's not a
consistent methodology being pursued and

00:23:27.170 --> 00:23:27.180
consistent methodology being pursued and
 

00:23:27.180 --> 00:23:28.850
consistent methodology being pursued and
part of the issue is if you look at a

00:23:28.850 --> 00:23:28.860
part of the issue is if you look at a
 

00:23:28.860 --> 00:23:31.100
part of the issue is if you look at a
framework you know that's used let's say

00:23:31.100 --> 00:23:31.110
framework you know that's used let's say
 

00:23:31.110 --> 00:23:33.490
framework you know that's used let's say

at a fortune 500 company like iris right
that's a retroactive look that's

00:23:35.990 --> 00:23:36.000
that's a retroactive look that's
 

00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:37.880
that's a retroactive look that's
basically telling you what's happened

00:23:37.880 --> 00:23:37.890
basically telling you what's happened
 

00:23:37.890 --> 00:23:39.440
basically telling you what's happened
but you know we're all dealing with

00:23:39.440 --> 00:23:39.450
but you know we're all dealing with
 

00:23:39.450 --> 00:23:41.420
but you know we're all dealing with
technologies that are coming out of the

00:23:41.420 --> 00:23:41.430
technologies that are coming out of the
 

00:23:41.430 --> 00:23:44.450
technologies that are coming out of the
lab they're nowhere near scale they're

00:23:44.450 --> 00:23:44.460
lab they're nowhere near scale they're
 

00:23:44.460 --> 00:23:46.430
lab they're nowhere near scale they're
not near the market or maybe they're

00:23:46.430 --> 00:23:46.440
not near the market or maybe they're
 

00:23:46.440 --> 00:23:50.210
not near the market or maybe they're
just entering the market you really to

00:23:50.210 --> 00:23:50.220
just entering the market you really to
 

00:23:50.220 --> 00:23:52.490
just entering the market you really to
measure what their potential impact will

00:23:52.490 --> 00:23:52.500
measure what their potential impact will
 

00:23:52.500 --> 00:23:55.700
measure what their potential impact will
be kind of on a forward-looking basis is

00:23:55.700 --> 00:23:55.710
be kind of on a forward-looking basis is
 

00:23:55.710 --> 00:23:58.640
be kind of on a forward-looking basis is
incredibly difficult and the danger I

00:23:58.640 --> 00:23:58.650
incredibly difficult and the danger I
 

00:23:58.650 --> 00:24:02.060
incredibly difficult and the danger I
think is that there'll be a propagation

00:24:02.060 --> 00:24:02.070
think is that there'll be a propagation
 

00:24:02.070 --> 00:24:03.230
think is that there'll be a propagation
of different approaches and

00:24:03.230 --> 00:24:03.240
of different approaches and
 

00:24:03.240 --> 00:24:07.400
of different approaches and
methodologies and suddenly people will

00:24:07.400 --> 00:24:07.410
methodologies and suddenly people will
 

00:24:07.410 --> 00:24:09.200
methodologies and suddenly people will
get concerned because they don't know

00:24:09.200 --> 00:24:09.210
get concerned because they don't know
 

00:24:09.210 --> 00:24:11.060
get concerned because they don't know
who to trust and it may actually scare

00:24:11.060 --> 00:24:11.070
who to trust and it may actually scare
 

00:24:11.070 --> 00:24:13.820
who to trust and it may actually scare

those people who are approaching

00:24:15.830 --> 00:24:15.840
those people who are approaching
 

00:24:15.840 --> 00:24:19.730
those people who are approaching
with an impact lens yeah I I agree and I

00:24:19.730 --> 00:24:19.740
with an impact lens yeah I I agree and I
 

00:24:19.740 --> 00:24:22.789
with an impact lens yeah I I agree and I
I do a lot of work in a conservative

00:24:22.789 --> 00:24:22.799
I do a lot of work in a conservative
 

00:24:22.799 --> 00:24:25.549
I do a lot of work in a conservative
part of the country and I've had to

00:24:25.549 --> 00:24:25.559
part of the country and I've had to
 

00:24:25.559 --> 00:24:30.110
part of the country and I've had to
shift and it's ROI first impact second

00:24:30.110 --> 00:24:30.120
shift and it's ROI first impact second
 

00:24:30.120 --> 00:24:32.810
shift and it's ROI first impact second
now impact what does that mean yeah you

00:24:32.810 --> 00:24:32.820
now impact what does that mean yeah you
 

00:24:32.820 --> 00:24:35.080
now impact what does that mean yeah you
want to have a positive impact on

00:24:35.080 --> 00:24:35.090
want to have a positive impact on
 

00:24:35.090 --> 00:24:39.680
want to have a positive impact on
society on the planet who doesn't but at

00:24:39.690 --> 00:24:41.600
society on the planet who doesn't but at
the end of the day it's it's also about

00:24:41.600 --> 00:24:41.610
the end of the day it's it's also about
 

00:24:41.610 --> 00:24:43.760
the end of the day it's it's also about
ROI people want to make a return on

00:24:43.760 --> 00:24:43.770
ROI people want to make a return on
 

00:24:43.770 --> 00:24:47.419
ROI people want to make a return on
their investment and it's something that

00:24:47.419 --> 00:24:47.429
their investment and it's something that
 

00:24:47.429 --> 00:24:49.519
their investment and it's something that
I'm talking about now with some folks is

00:24:49.519 --> 00:24:49.529
I'm talking about now with some folks is
 

00:24:49.529 --> 00:24:53.450
I'm talking about now with some folks is
that everybody is admitting that the

00:24:53.450 --> 00:24:53.460
that everybody is admitting that the
 

00:24:53.460 --> 00:24:54.830
that everybody is admitting that the
climate is changing

00:24:54.830 --> 00:24:54.840
climate is changing
 

00:24:54.840 --> 00:24:56.779
climate is changing
they just can't say climate change even

00:24:56.779 --> 00:24:56.789
they just can't say climate change even
 

00:24:56.789 --> 00:24:59.000
they just can't say climate change even
Scott Pruett is saying but the climate

00:24:59.000 --> 00:24:59.010
Scott Pruett is saying but the climate
 

00:24:59.010 --> 00:25:01.399
Scott Pruett is saying but the climate
is changing okay we all we all know it

00:25:01.399 --> 00:25:01.409
is changing okay we all we all know it
 

00:25:01.409 --> 00:25:05.570
is changing okay we all we all know it
it's baked in the data is there so why

00:25:05.570 --> 00:25:05.580
it's baked in the data is there so why
 

00:25:05.580 --> 00:25:09.289
it's baked in the data is there so why
aren't we moving faster and I think this

00:25:09.289 --> 00:25:09.299
aren't we moving faster and I think this
 

00:25:09.299 --> 00:25:13.610
aren't we moving faster and I think this

went public a billion dollar valuation
and today it doesn't exist

00:39:12.300 --> 00:39:12.310
and today it doesn't exist
 

00:39:12.310 --> 00:39:14.070

and I think that is a trend not to take
 

00:39:19.050 --> 00:39:21.740
and I think that is a trend not to take
lightly obviously and when you think

00:39:21.740 --> 00:39:21.750
lightly obviously and when you think
 

00:39:21.750 --> 00:39:24.470
lightly obviously and when you think
about long-term price on natural gas the

00:39:24.470 --> 00:39:24.480
about long-term price on natural gas the
 

00:39:24.480 --> 00:39:26.390
about long-term price on natural gas the
other to think about is when

over and demand for oil drops now you're
 

00:39:32.520 --> 00:39:35.930
over and demand for oil drops now you're
gonna see oil become super cheap so if
