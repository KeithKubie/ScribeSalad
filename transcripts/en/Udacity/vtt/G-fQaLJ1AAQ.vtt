00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
So now we've seen all the gory details

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
in how to implement parsing

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
for languages like HTML and JavaScript.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Recall that parsing takes some tokens as input

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
and produces a parse tree--

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
something like this, perhaps.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:19.000
In our next exciting episode we're going to learn how to interpret languages

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
by walking over their parse trees.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
For example, maybe this is equal to 7.

00:00:23.000 --> 09:59:59.000
Let's find out.
